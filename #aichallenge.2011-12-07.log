2011-12-07T01:23:30  <lampahalogenowa> Hello. I've got problem today with my C# program. He worked yesterday, played fine, but today i've got message " error CS2007: Unrecognized command-line option: `--optimize=all' ". Seems like error at your side :)
2011-12-07T01:25:18  <lampahalogenowa> Also I've got question about C# standard library. Which one is used: default created by Microsoft or mono implementation ?  (there are some differences)
2011-12-07T01:25:44  <BenJackson> a) fixed soon or already
2011-12-07T01:25:48  <BenJackson> b) almost certainly mono
2011-12-07T01:25:51  <BenJackson> since it runs on linux

2011-12-07T06:08:39  <thestinger> my combat code has issues like that

2011-12-07T06:18:20  <Fluxid> or maybe... hm
2011-12-07T06:18:46  <thestinger> lol this works well against my own bot
2011-12-07T06:18:59  <thestinger> I just made hill defense cover the whole map :P
2011-12-07T06:20:17  <Fluxid> anyway, i'm happy, my bot is able to handle 350 ants in 500ms while defence and combat is still on. if there would be no enough time my ants would suddenly rush forward ignoring enemy, and i didn't see it happen, so it's good
2011-12-07T06:20:39  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-07T06:20:44  <thestinger> if I ran out of time, my ants would just not attack
2011-12-07T06:20:52  <thestinger> they would form up a big wall next to enemy ants
2011-12-07T06:21:12  <Fluxid> mine would attack, and because some ants would be lost (not only mine) the bot would get some more time to think ;)
2011-12-07T06:21:16  <thestinger> my combat is so bad atm that I can't run of time though

2011-12-07T13:01:11  <Mystret> A question about the tcp servers: are they all using the same (version of the) engine? i'm asking because i've experienced some kind of error twice on tcpants.com now. sometimes when i output a legal move, my ant isnt moved by the server
2011-12-07T13:01:50  <Mystret> next turn it just gives my ant at the old position, causing some board of sync (debug) exception in my code
2011-12-07T13:02:00  <Mystret> i've only experienced it on tcpants.com though
2011-12-07T13:02:08  <Mystret> not on fluxid
2011-12-07T13:02:16  <a1k0n> weird.  i'm sure they are using the same engine

2011-12-07T13:33:25  <a1k0n> really?  i think food spawns after you move
2011-12-07T13:34:00  <Minthos> well either that or there's a bug somewhere
2011-12-07T13:34:20  <a1k0n> move, attack, raze, spawn, gather
2011-12-07T13:34:35  <Minthos> cause I quite often get blocked moves for no apparent reason
2011-12-07T13:34:37  <thestinger> no, you can be blocked by food
2011-12-07T13:34:43  <thestinger> it spawns before you get the turn info
2011-12-07T13:35:03  <a1k0n> not according to the spec
2011-12-07T13:35:13  <Minthos> then the spec is wrong...
2011-12-07T13:35:27  <Minthos> or the toolkit is wrong

2011-12-07T13:35:39  <Minthos> something is wrong at least
2011-12-07T13:36:40  <a1k0n> are you getting "move blocked" feedback?
2011-12-07T13:38:04  <Minthos> I don't remember if that's why I got it, but every once in a while my bot reports an ant not having obeyed its move command
2011-12-07T13:38:16  <janzert> spawn in that list above is only referring to spawning ants
2011-12-07T13:38:38  <janzert> food 'spawning' seems to happen at the very end
2011-12-07T13:38:51  <janzert> see the finish_turn method in ants.py
2011-12-07T13:38:55  <a1k0n> yeah, it happens after gathering
2011-12-07T13:39:05  <a1k0n> so the spec isn't complete either
2011-12-07T13:39:16  <janzert> orders, attack, raze, spawn ants, gather, spawn food
2011-12-07T13:40:01  <a1k0n> Minthos: do you have a replay w/ turn# and ant location where it got blocked?

2011-12-07T13:43:47  <thestinger> janzert: yeah, it happens at the end so food can be next to your ants when you get turn info
2011-12-07T13:43:55  <thestinger> and you have to stay next to it to gather it
2011-12-07T13:44:21  <thestinger> not really an important thing :P

2011-12-07T13:54:14  <g0llum> Mystret, you timed out in turn 433, so no more moving from there on ?
2011-12-07T13:54:24  <a1k0n> timed out a couple turns later
2011-12-07T13:54:32  <Minthos> I'm getting it from playgame.py
2011-12-07T13:54:59  <Minthos> but I can't seem to correlate it to my bot's confusion, which is strange
2011-12-07T13:56:02  <rwest> moving onto water is bad!
2011-12-07T13:56:19  <Minthos> I can't imagine my bot would do that
2011-12-07T13:57:06  <rwest> does your bot have the option to stay still? my bot didn't and sometimes it had no other move so it kept trying to go onto water
2011-12-07T13:57:11  <rwest> when stuck
2011-12-07T13:57:14  <Minthos> yes
2011-12-07T13:57:14  <Mystret> i timed out because my client detected that the move that i made was not processed by the server and therefore threw an exception
2011-12-07T13:58:47  <Mystret> for debugging purposes i check at the start of each turn whether my representation of the board is still 'correct'
2011-12-07T13:59:20  <Mystret> my bot moved ant 61,191 north at turn 433
2011-12-07T14:00:15  <Mystret> but at turn 434 i received the a 61 191 0 message from the server, instead of the expected a 60 191 0
2011-12-07T14:03:52  <Minthos> I changed my bot to not move onto food, and blocked messages are gone

2011-12-07T14:17:27  <BenJackson> and the contest is adding and dropping servers as the price varies hourly
2011-12-07T14:17:42  <Mystret> ah okay
2011-12-07T14:17:57  <BenJackson> there's a status page

2011-12-07T14:18:26  <Mystret> yea, i noticed that there sometimes are more servers than on other moments
2011-12-07T14:18:32  <Nihil688> ah it just got fixed :)
2011-12-07T14:18:33  <Mystret> didn't know that was the reason though

2011-12-07T16:06:50  <g0llum> was top 10 in pw, only ;(
2011-12-07T16:07:35  <Fluxid> what!?
2011-12-07T16:07:43  <Fluxid> so i need to be top10 then!
2011-12-07T16:08:04  <Fluxid> how many were there in tron?
2011-12-07T16:09:13  <Anilm3> Fluxid: I thought so
2011-12-07T16:09:32  <Anilm3> I don't know what you mean by finals
2011-12-07T16:11:09  <Anilm3> I thought the rankings were restarted and everything run for a week...
2011-12-07T16:11:44  <Anilm3> amstan: could you clear our doubts?
2011-12-07T16:11:46  <bqf> Fluxid: i'm pretty sure that reaching the "finals" is not about having your bot be in a good spot at the end of the "open" challenge; what is meant is that, after submissions are closed, enough games will be played to find the top ten bots, then have those fight amongst themselves for the final victory in order to not have luck decide the winner.
2011-12-07T16:12:20  <Fluxid> ah, ok

2011-12-07T16:15:52  <g0llum> honestly, i don'tlike that idea of having a 'final' contest restricted to a few only. as of pw, my interest in that faded at the moment, my bot wasn't in any more

2011-12-07T16:18:26  <McLeopold> so, you don't know why I made the change? or how to merge on github?
2011-12-07T16:19:12  <jab_bott> McLeopold: I think I understand the problem - it crashes when there's no v commands? but I don't get the solution you posted - can JavaScript use variables that are defined anywhere in the function?
2011-12-07T16:19:52  <bqf> g0llum: that "final" contest is, as i said, probably meant to reduce the impact of luck on the final rankings of the top10. if you run all games within those 10 last bots, you can weed out any statistical anomalies a lot faster. of course that might also mean that some bot that should have been in the top10 didn't reach it, but there _is_ a limited time for finding the winner - so some compromises will have to be made. ;)
2011-12-07T16:19:53  <McLeopold> yes, it always goes down the prototype chain until it hits the global scope looking for stuff
2011-12-07T16:20:38  <McLeopold> jab_bott: also, the latest changes made a previous replay stop working
2011-12-07T16:20:57  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if the replay is missing layer info?
2011-12-07T16:21:15  <jab_bott> so even though the overlay_history variable is defined a few lines later, it can be checked before it's defined?
2011-12-07T16:21:38  <McLeopold> sometimes
2011-12-07T16:21:46  <McLeopold> it depends on hosting
2011-12-07T16:22:06  <jab_bott> that's utterly messed up - what value does it hold? huh? hosting?
2011-12-07T16:22:08  <McLeopold> sometimes you need to do typeof var !== 'undefined'
2011-12-07T16:22:21  <McLeopold> hoisting
2011-12-07T16:22:36  <McLeopold> I think that may be functions only
2011-12-07T16:22:57  <jab_bott> so I can do if i == 3 { do something } var i = 3; ???
2011-12-07T16:23:09  <kincody> y are the worker servers ofline?will the be back on soon?
2011-12-07T16:23:43  <McLeopold> http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting
2011-12-07T16:25:33  <McLeopold> jab_bott: you can always do var == 3, but sometimes var isn't defined, which will throw an error, in which case you do typeof var == 'undefined'

2011-12-07T16:28:17  <jab_bott> McLeopold: but overlay_history is defined on line 890 as: var overlay_history = blah...; and so it's scoped locally within the function - there's no global version of that variable, so won't it always be undefined at line 882?
2011-12-07T16:28:43  <McLeopold> but its definition is hoisted to the top of the function
2011-12-07T16:29:12  <McLeopold> I honestly didn't try and understand how everything worked.  I just saw that I got an error and tossed in a check that prevented it.
2011-12-07T16:29:45  <McLeopold> there may be a better solution, but that seems to prevent any errors
2011-12-07T16:30:48  <jab_bott> so if something is hoisted, does the assignment get hoisted too or just the declaration?
2011-12-07T16:32:11  <McLeopold> just the declaration, so the var is == undefined until the correct time
2011-12-07T16:32:26  <McLeopold> except function definitions get something done right away, I think
2011-12-07T16:33:06  <McLeopold> now that I look at it, that fix was for an earlier version, and I think it might be wrong...
2011-12-07T16:33:50  <McLeopold> https://github.com/j-h-a/aichallenge/blob/d087e2229698614aa6ec489e66016a9126b1de8c/ants/visualizer/js/CanvasElement.js#L861
2011-12-07T16:34:01  <McLeopold> yeah, it made a lot more sense on this version :)
2011-12-07T16:34:05  <jab_bott> ok, I think that page explains it... the assignment isn't hoisted, just the declaration, so probably your fix did in fact fix it for no overlays, but not for when there is
2011-12-07T16:34:24  <McLeopold> right, so I probably broke it on paste

2011-12-07T16:35:31  <jab_bott> ok - I'll move all the checks to the top of that function to make it clearer and put in returns if nothing is to be done..
2011-12-07T16:36:48  <McLeopold> yeah, ignore my pull request
2011-12-07T16:37:00  <McLeopold> just assume that overlay_history may not exist
2011-12-07T16:37:39  <jab_bott> yeah - I put that code into a function so it can be called for each 'layer' for the new setLayer command - and I did some shifting around a bit (at 02:00 early this morning) so not surprising I broke something :D
2011-12-07T16:37:49  <jab_bott> will fix now
2011-12-07T16:38:08  <McLeopold> okay, I'm waiting to pull it for paste
2011-12-07T16:38:31  <jab_bott> what's the logical opposite of !== undefined ?
2011-12-07T16:38:41  <McLeopold> == undefined?
2011-12-07T16:39:04  <jab_bott> could be ===
2011-12-07T16:39:26  <McLeopold> you should probably just to if (this.state.replay.meta['replaydata']['overlay_history']) {...
2011-12-07T16:39:45  <McLeopold> so, check to see if the overlay_history property exists
2011-12-07T16:40:05  <jab_bott> you can tell I've never done any JS before :P
2011-12-07T16:40:54  <McLeopold> actually, I'm going to suggest a different approach now...

2011-12-07T19:47:48  <BenJackson> the dx is good for that
2011-12-07T19:47:57  <BenJackson> I haven't tried that on the fire yet
2011-12-07T19:48:51  <Anilm3> I'm looking for an alternative to paper but I'm not sure yet
2011-12-07T19:49:12  <jab_bott> Anilm3: no - not technical books
2011-12-07T19:49:17  <BenJackson> what I miss on the dx is thumbing through books
2011-12-07T19:49:27  <BenJackson> but the screen is big enough for most technical books
2011-12-07T19:49:37  <jab_bott> Anilm3: but you can zoom and all - so if you need to see detail you can.
2011-12-07T19:50:05  <Anilm3> but I suppose it can't be too comfortable
2011-12-07T19:50:11  <BenJackson> pdfs are a bit worse because full screen is a bit hard to read (scaling) and anything larger involves paging back and forth to read columns (like in technical papers)
2011-12-07T19:50:11  <Anilm3> I don't know I think I have to try first
2011-12-07T19:50:35  <BenJackson> the fire is a LOT faster to render than the dx so I've used it for PDFs where I scrolled and zoomed around
2011-12-07T19:50:40  <BenJackson> (eg the manual to my thermostat)
2011-12-07T19:51:01  <BenJackson> but it does have a smaller screen, lower battery life, etc
2011-12-07T19:51:14  <Anilm3> small screen is a problem on technical books
2011-12-07T19:51:16  <jab_bott> Anilm3: valgrind output here: http://pastebin.com/i6b82LDt
2011-12-07T19:51:55  <BenJackson> Anilm3: on a kindle 2 or dx if it doesn't fit on the screen it's painful to reposition (slow rendering) but the fire will pan around quickly
2011-12-07T19:51:56  <Anilm3> jab_bott: have you tried cleaning your files and recompiling?
2011-12-07T19:52:16  <BenJackson> I still buy most technical books in paper format, though

2011-12-07T20:14:57  <jab_bott> I don't think it's a problem, only that it expects things to be a bit different on a mac if built the usual mac way rather than with gcc -g

2011-12-07T20:15:28  <jab_bott> maybe it's more efficient to have the symbols separate?

2011-12-07T20:30:02  <jab_bott> amstan: yeah - it needs to create an Iterator to pass a pointer into doEnumeration
2011-12-07T20:30:03  <darkf> oh wait
2011-12-07T20:30:06  <darkf> you mean in the ()?
2011-12-07T20:30:18  <darkf> in that case yes
2011-12-07T20:30:25  <amstan> darkf: can i do like for((i=0;j=2);i<3;i++)
2011-12-07T20:30:36  <darkf> sure, but id rather do for(i=0, j=2)
2011-12-07T20:30:42  <amstan> jab_bott: i don't understand what subcount is used for

2011-12-07T20:32:58  <jab_bott> amstan: if the container has contiguous data it can report it all back in a single go, doEnumeration will set subItems and subCount and the for loop will iterate through those then the while will exit immediately, but if the items are not contiguous, doEnumeration can copy pointers to them into a smaller contiguous area and return that with subCount set to the smaller size then it will get called again to get the next batch
2011-12-07T20:33:54  <BenJackson> I'm not sure I understand the kind of person who would write that code but not just use C++

2011-12-07T20:35:57  <amstan> isn't there a way to make the preprocessor match the block inside the for in?
2011-12-07T20:35:57  <jab_bott> amstan: does it rely on C99 for(int i = 0; style ?
2011-12-07T20:36:11  <amstan> yes, that too
2011-12-07T20:36:29  <amstan> and let me guess, c99 is not enabled?

2011-12-07T20:40:40  <darkf> oh
2011-12-07T20:40:40  <darkf> okay

2011-12-07T20:41:47  <jab_bott> it's been so long sin ce I wrote any C - it was actually useful to implement queues and lists and things to get back up to speed.
2011-12-07T20:42:15  <darkf> I... remember everything
2011-12-07T20:42:19  <darkf> I still remember Haskell
2011-12-07T20:42:44  <jimi_hendrix> Zannick, then why does it grow/shrink and have numbers
2011-12-07T20:42:52  <Zannick> oh, that triangle
2011-12-07T20:42:59  <Zannick> that's the number of ants left to spawn for that player

2011-12-07T20:43:48  <jimi_hendrix> Zannick, that cant spawn because there are ants sitting on the hill?

2011-12-07T20:44:23  <amstan> jab_bott: apparently go was designed to be like C, with the easy of use of languages like python
2011-12-07T20:44:23  <BenJackson> I was hoping to point out how many times Go appeared :)
2011-12-07T20:44:26  <darkf> Anilm3: do you really want me to explain?

2011-12-07T20:44:43  <darkf> the language itself is awful
2011-12-07T20:44:48  <jimi_hendrix> ok

2011-12-07T20:45:07  <darkf> you could make a #1 bot in VB.NET, does that make it good?

2011-12-07T20:46:56  <jab_bott> I could do it like a giant macro, so you had a }) at the end
2011-12-07T20:46:58  <amstan> jab_bott: and try to not declare variables

2011-12-07T20:47:19  <darkf> the thing is I would just go with some dumb divide and conquer strategy
2011-12-07T20:47:23  <darkf> then end up winning anyway
2011-12-07T20:47:34  <amstan> you can't declare variables, neither in the for loop stuff because it's not c99
2011-12-07T20:47:35  <jab_bott> amstan: but it needs to be multiple loops and it needs the iterator, so that non-contiguous collections can implement it
2011-12-07T20:47:53  <darkf> then set -std=gnuc99
2011-12-07T20:47:59  <amstan> neither before it because it'll either need a {} wrapping it, or stuff like if() forin() will be broken
2011-12-07T20:48:04  <darkf> or write moar correct C89
2011-12-07T20:48:18  <jab_bott> amstan: huh? oh I'm screwed then
2011-12-07T20:48:24  <amstan> darkf: can't, it might break some people's codes
2011-12-07T20:48:52  <jab_bott> amstan: though it seems to work without any C99 options on.. I'm using variable declarations in the beginning of any block.
2011-12-07T20:49:34  <darkf> jab_bott: if they're in the beginning it's fine
2011-12-07T20:49:36  <amstan> jab_bott: my goal was to elliminate the for_in_end
2011-12-07T20:50:18  <amstan> but to do that you need a way to include all your code in the first statment and only have one {} for the code block
2011-12-07T20:50:24  <jab_bott> amstan: ahh ok - I was getting confused - thought you meant on the ants server I can't do that because it's only C99 - tbh I never remember what's what, I just build it and let the compiler tell me
2011-12-07T20:50:53  <amstan> compiler for ants does not like c99
2011-12-07T20:51:21  <jab_bott> amstan: that could be possible in C99 by having a for loop with no brackets with a single for loop inside it - and the iterator would be in the outer for loop, declared inside the for()

2011-12-07T20:51:46  <amstan> good idea
2011-12-07T20:51:56  <amstan> but you still have to do Iterator        _iterator; somewhere
2011-12-07T20:53:16  <amstan> unless you declare it a global
2011-12-07T20:53:21  <amstan> but that's just no
2011-12-07T20:53:41  <jab_bott> for(Iterator _iterator = {initial values...}; _iterator.idx < _iterator.count; _iterator.idx++) for(<inner for loop>)
2011-12-07T20:54:11  <amstan> yes, that'll work on c99, but you can't use that for the contest
2011-12-07T20:54:39  <jab_bott> yeah I know - I don't think there's a way to do it without - I'm not bothered though, it's fine
2011-12-07T20:55:20  <amstan> it would be nice if you could nest preprocessor stuff too

2011-12-07T20:56:19  <amstan> then you could do something like #define } #ifdef INSIDE_FOR_IN _iterator.idx++; }}} #else } #endif
2011-12-07T20:56:32  <jab_bott> wtf? Is that a function pointer called void that takes a function pointer?

2011-12-07T21:12:11  <amstan> greghaynes: ohai
2011-12-07T21:12:14  <greghaynes> :)
2011-12-07T21:12:16  <Anilm3> doesn't really look good for google...
2011-12-07T21:12:19  <amstan> greghaynes: darkf is also here
2011-12-07T21:12:24  <greghaynes> darkf: You!
2011-12-07T21:12:25  <darkf> hey greghaynes
2011-12-07T21:12:27  <darkf> whats up
2011-12-07T21:12:34  <greghaynes> Same old stuff, making killer robots
2011-12-07T21:12:37  <greghaynes> you?
2011-12-07T21:12:48  <darkf> greghaynes: nice. I made a funny language :) https://github.com/darkf/possumv2
2011-12-07T21:12:53  <amstan> greghaynes: he wants to support his new language in this contest: https://github.com/darkf/possumv2
2011-12-07T21:12:58  <darkf> indeedy
2011-12-07T21:13:01  <greghaynes> hahah
2011-12-07T21:13:03  <greghaynes> awesome
2011-12-07T21:13:15  <Anilm3> amstan: so putting up a vote to see if people would like extending the deadline is out of the question?
2011-12-07T21:13:17  <darkf> also, I like functional programming
2011-12-07T21:13:19  <greghaynes> What kind of language is it?
2011-12-07T21:13:20  <darkf> (surprise)

2011-12-07T21:13:31  <amstan> greghaynes: so.. you getting the people to compete? there's only like 1.5 weeks left
2011-12-07T21:13:36  <darkf> greghaynes: it's kind of like scheme without parentheses. functions have a fixed arity so it just groups them by that
2011-12-07T21:13:47  <greghaynes> amstan: yea, I think we can make a winning bot in < 1 week
2011-12-07T21:13:48  <amstan> Anilm3: it's not about money, just people's plans
2011-12-07T21:14:07  <amstan> Anilm3: it wouldn't be fair to the people that decided not to implement a strategy because of time constraints
2011-12-07T21:14:10  <greghaynes> darkf: Are you a college student yet?
2011-12-07T21:14:15  <darkf> greghaynes: not yet
2011-12-07T21:14:24  <greghaynes> darkf: They do a lot of functional language dev at my uni
2011-12-07T21:14:31  <darkf> greghaynes: nice, where at?
2011-12-07T21:14:35  <greghaynes> might want to put it on your list of places to look, portland state
2011-12-07T21:14:54  <Anilm3> I know, I just have to abandon my bot as I had to with pw

2011-12-07T21:15:24  <greghaynes> darkf: ah, I from houston
2011-12-07T21:15:27  <darkf> :)
2011-12-07T21:15:33  <greghaynes> Ill be in houston in about 1 week actually
2011-12-07T21:15:38  <amstan> Anilm3: mcleopold wants to use ants for testing the zeta framework
2011-12-07T21:15:39  <darkf> awesome
2011-12-07T21:15:46  <greghaynes> Will you be in austin then?
2011-12-07T21:15:54  <darkf> I could be
2011-12-07T21:15:58  <amstan> Anilm3: so you might want to stay after the finals to help us
2011-12-07T21:16:03  <Anilm3> amstan: Count me in
2011-12-07T21:16:13  <amstan> Anilm3: do you know python?
2011-12-07T21:16:18  <greghaynes> darkf: Heres one thing they dev at psu - http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~rebekah/os/
2011-12-07T21:16:31  <Anilm3> Not very well, but I can learn quickly
2011-12-07T21:16:36  <darkf> greghaynes: haha, are they going to formally verify it?
2011-12-07T21:16:36  <amstan> greghaynes: is that like monadOS?
2011-12-07T21:16:40  <Anilm3> I've always wanted to learn
2011-12-07T21:16:46  <greghaynes> amstan: darkf yep
2011-12-07T21:16:57  <darkf> or are haskell programs even considered formally proved if they compile
2011-12-07T21:17:07  <greghaynes> They arent ;)
2011-12-07T21:17:10  <darkf> ah cool
2011-12-07T21:17:15  <darkf> there was a project that formally verified an OS
2011-12-07T21:17:17  <darkf> I think it was l4
2011-12-07T21:17:51  <greghaynes> yea, one of our profs helped do that
2011-12-07T21:17:57  <darkf> oh man
2011-12-07T21:18:02  <darkf> I need to move there
2011-12-07T21:18:33  <greghaynes> I mean, dont let me give you the impression that its crazy amazing, but they do seem to do alot of functional stuff
2011-12-07T21:18:54  <greghaynes> amstan: Are youall going to run the competition after the deadline at all just for fun?
2011-12-07T21:19:04  <darkf> sounds awesome to me regardless
2011-12-07T21:19:11  <amstan> greghaynes: we never did that, but we could
2011-12-07T21:19:19  <amstan> greghaynes: we could even do for pw
2011-12-07T21:19:29  <amstan> we still have the 5GB of bots
2011-12-07T21:19:34  <greghaynes> heh
2011-12-07T21:19:57  <Anilm3> amstan: if I help with the development can I participate?
2011-12-07T21:20:02  <Anilm3> Mcleopold participates right?
2011-12-07T21:20:12  <amstan> Anilm3: probably anyone can
2011-12-07T21:20:19  <amstan> but don't expect anything to be stable or fast
2011-12-07T21:20:36  <darkf> greghaynes: the only thing I really hate is working on typesystems, they kill my brain
2011-12-07T21:20:48  <Anilm3> amstan: it's ok!
2011-12-07T21:20:48  <greghaynes> ah
2011-12-07T21:21:01  <greghaynes> But types is what verification is all about1
2011-12-07T21:21:06  <darkf> yes :(
2011-12-07T21:21:22  <darkf> someday I want to be able to implement structural typing + H-M type inference
2011-12-07T21:21:33  <darkf> then I'll write some cool stuff
2011-12-07T21:21:37  <greghaynes> heh
2011-12-07T21:21:48  <greghaynes> Right after I make my flying car ;)

2011-12-07T22:02:26  <BenJackson> aha, someone already had my idea
2011-12-07T22:02:36  <BenJackson> it is basically implemented
2011-12-07T22:02:38  <BenJackson> but unused
2011-12-07T22:02:51  <Anilm3> what idea BenJackson ?

2011-12-07T22:04:03  <BenJackson> basically interleaving bot runs across multiple games
2011-12-07T22:04:46  <BenJackson> the engine has support for running bots serially instead of in parallel
2011-12-07T22:05:00  <BenJackson> and actually one of the configs appears to use that option... wrong?
2011-12-07T22:05:50  <BenJackson> anyway running the ants serially would mean that one CPU could theoretically be fully used running one game
2011-12-07T22:05:58  <BenJackson> and then you could runa  game per CPU
2011-12-07T22:06:01  <BenJackson> if you had enough memory
2011-12-07T22:06:11  <Anilm3> I see
2011-12-07T22:06:13  <BenJackson> setup/server_info.php.template has "serial":2
2011-12-07T22:06:52  <BenJackson> but playgame.py does not implement "--serial 2" so I'm not sure what that means
2011-12-07T22:07:30  <BenJackson> maybe nothign because that setup doesn't match reality in other ways so it might be dead or just not the current config
2011-12-07T22:08:36  <Anilm3> it's still an interesting idea but I think each bot can have up to 1GB of memory so the servers may be full with one game
2011-12-07T22:08:48  <BenJackson> yeah, depends on the machine class
2011-12-07T22:09:42  <BenJackson> I do notice that the engine relies on pipe buffering

2011-12-07T23:31:29  <BenJackson> well my ants-in-hill counter works
2011-12-07T23:36:17  <besh> bj: what are u using that for ?
2011-12-07T23:36:23  <BenJackson> nothing!
2011-12-07T23:36:49  <BenJackson> I haven't figured out quite what I want to to do fix my strategy problem
2011-12-07T23:36:55  <BenJackson> so instead I'm puttering around doing other things
2011-12-07T23:38:01  <besh> do you want to change your strategy so late now ?
2011-12-07T23:38:10  <BenJackson> yes!
2011-12-07T23:38:22  <BenJackson> I'm not in #1, so it's time for revisions!
2011-12-07T23:38:34  <besh> looks like pguillay's way is the winner. I suspected it
2011-12-07T23:38:48  <BenJackson> What "way"?
2011-12-07T23:39:27  <besh> sending ants to the frontier and pushing from there.
2011-12-07T23:40:36  <besh> Look at the latest game http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=171911&user=589
2011-12-07T23:40:43  <besh> it literally murdered xathis.
2011-12-07T23:41:38  <besh> Proves my point. There is really nothing you can do in combat when your strategy is weaker to begin with...
2011-12-07T23:41:41  <BenJackson> go to the end of that one and toggle vis for white
2011-12-07T23:41:44  <BenJackson> that's what's impressive to me
2011-12-07T23:42:37  <besh> do u mean complete view of the whole area. I think in that regard xathis can do better
2011-12-07T23:42:48  <BenJackson> really look at what he's doing
2011-12-07T23:42:53  <BenJackson> he has almost perfect view of the land
2011-12-07T23:42:57  <BenJackson> but nothing wasted on water
2011-12-07T23:43:18  <besh> ha that is smart
2011-12-07T23:43:35  <BenJackson> I should just go implement that
2011-12-07T23:43:44  <BenJackson> I keep thinking it will be too slow
2011-12-07T23:43:52  <BenJackson> but I thought that about my last idea and it worked fine
2011-12-07T23:43:58  <besh> I also noticed it also doesn't waste ants defending/attacking through water.
