2010-09-18T01:45:05  <rwa> Naith: usually when I see the small streams it's because the planet is firing out ships as fast as it can make them.  I can't think of an advantage to waiting around to send a big chunk - you want to get ships there as fast as you can
2010-09-18T01:48:48  <Naith> rwa: Ahh, thanks! Ya that makes a lot more sense now! :P

2010-09-18T01:54:10  <dhartmei> Naith: fleets on long trips are no longer commandable, you're less flexible (to react to opponent) when all your ships are in-flight, that's a vague disadvantage
2010-09-18T01:54:58  <dhartmei> also, if you send everything from a source planet, you leave the source planet more vulnerable. fleets have no defensive value.

2010-09-18T02:00:12  <Naith> dhartmei: hmm man that's really true! Thanks, yeah, my logic was just something like bigger chunks would be better because you're using unnecessary ships to cope with the growth rate of the other planets when you send them in small streams in the longer time it takes to take over a planet

2010-09-18T06:24:45  <antimatroid1> surpsisingly awesome
2010-09-18T06:25:00  <antimatroid1> i wonder how an optimal response like bot would go
2010-09-18T06:25:11  <antimatroid1> i guess that's the idea, but to what they JUST did
2010-09-18T06:25:22  <sigh> antimatroid1: what do you mean?
2010-09-18T06:25:40  <antimatroid1> well there's a very obvious optimal move if say the other bot tries to take a neutral near you
2010-09-18T06:25:55  <sigh> yes...
2010-09-18T06:26:10  <antimatroid1> so do a bot that strictly responds to the moves the enemy just made
2010-09-18T06:26:25  <antimatroid1> it wouldn't be a winning strategy, but i'd be curious as to how well that ranked
2010-09-18T06:26:33  <hakand> http://a1k0n.net/temp/map34.html best game i watched so far (:

2010-09-18T06:29:00  <antimatroid1> no, i was using the term very losely, basically just a bot that picks its moves off of the information of the moves made by the player in the last turn
2010-09-18T06:29:08  <antimatroid1> so basically assumes there is always a second mover advantage
2010-09-18T06:29:15  <sigh> ah, ok... yes
2010-09-18T06:29:21  <antimatroid1> which is clearly not general, but would do reasonably well
2010-09-18T06:29:47  <sigh> so optimal moves under the pessimal assumption that the opponent knows the move you are going to make?
2010-09-18T06:31:47  <sigh> antimatroid1: hah... I got a 4th game
2010-09-18T06:33:11  <antimatroid1> damn you, i'm on two and i uploaded like at least an hour earlier

2010-09-18T08:51:34  <Naktibalda> rankings must be very unstable because of this
2010-09-18T08:53:06  <atmz443> any reason why the server may have reset my bot? (deleted old games/reset ranking)
2010-09-18T08:53:17  <hakand> resubmission?
2010-09-18T08:53:48  <atmz443> the tcp server

2010-09-18T08:54:58  <bartwe> hmz or longer
2010-09-18T08:55:17  <atmz443> I think maybe it resets stats if you havent played in a while
2010-09-18T08:55:28  <atmz443> but if you are active, it remembers your old stats

2010-09-18T09:05:08  <antimatroid1> i have bounced ideas off him etc. though, so I couldn't claim to have worked only on my own

2010-09-18T09:07:00  <antimatroid1> probably couldn't handle other units with large assignments etc.
2010-09-18T09:07:07  <antimatroid1> i don't have to write a single essay this year :D

2010-09-18T09:09:49  <antimatroid1> mine does alright most of the time

2010-09-18T10:24:25  <sigh> but yes, password is defined by first use
2010-09-18T10:26:15  <hakand> jmcarthur: is anything planned to do sth about that?
2010-09-18T10:28:18  <sigh> wow... I have a huge bug in my code that redistributes ships between my own planets
2010-09-18T10:28:34  <sigh> now the question is whether fixing this bug will make my bot better :S
2010-09-18T10:28:55  <ntroPi> ^^ always keep a backup.
2010-09-18T10:29:21  <sigh> yah, everything I do is in version control
2010-09-18T10:29:43  <ntroPi> ok tcp  says this is gameId whatever ... how long should i wait after that?
2010-09-18T10:30:07  <ntroPi> ah now he has finished :-)
2010-09-18T10:31:24  <jmcarthur> hakand: no idea
2010-09-18T10:31:29  <jmcarthur> it's been discussed a lot
2010-09-18T10:32:54  *** smellyhippy <smellyhippy!~asmodean@about/csharp/regular/smellyhippy> has quit IRC (Quit: BUT WAIT! What are those penguins up to?!)
2010-09-18T10:33:05  <hakand> well, as the time advances, it will be a huge problem with the current server
2010-09-18T10:33:19  <Lafi> well if you followed the tutorial you sent the starting package right away
2010-09-18T10:33:53  <jmcarthur> the argument against removing them is that we are wanting to hook people quickly and the best way to do that is to have a working bot, submitted, playing games, and in the ranks, right off the bat

2010-09-18T10:34:25  <Lafi> I agree
2010-09-18T10:34:26  <jmcarthur> there are arguments to be made for removing them after x games though
2010-09-18T10:34:42  <hakand> yep thats is what came into my mind also
2010-09-18T10:34:50  <kcn1700> losed ;-(

2010-09-18T10:35:41  <hakand> as the matches between starter bots are generally lasts 200 turns with 1 fleet from each flying around
2010-09-18T10:35:53  <hakand> waste of resources, totally
2010-09-18T10:37:17  <sigh> f there's that many starting bots, you can even just cache the results and use that
2010-09-18T10:37:20  <sigh> *if
2010-09-18T10:38:09  <hakand> haha, true
2010-09-18T10:38:38  <ntroPi> uh ... seems i lose my elo rank if the opponent i won agains submits a new entry.
2010-09-18T10:39:49  <jmcarthur> okay, games between starter bots should be determinied probabilistically based on some sample data. that actually sounds like a reasonable idea to me
2010-09-18T10:40:36  <ntroPi> Doesn't that give some roome for manipulation? Especially assuming Multiple accounts?
2010-09-18T10:40:52  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: on the official server?
2010-09-18T10:40:57  <ntroPi> yes
2010-09-18T10:41:10  <hakand> starter vs starter -> mapx -> cached result
2010-09-18T10:41:21  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: well, you only lost rank because your game against that opponent no longer counts
2010-09-18T10:41:25  <hakand> instead of wasting 200 turns
2010-09-18T10:41:31  <jmcarthur> hakand: ah yeah, needs map too
2010-09-18T10:41:55  <jmcarthur> ah i guess it can be caches. the starters are all deterministic, right?
2010-09-18T10:42:03  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~quassel@cpc2-heme6-0-0-cust884.9-1.cable.virginmedia.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-18T10:42:06  <s_denchev> ntroPi: as far as I know these rating are preliminary
2010-09-18T10:42:07  <hakand> yea
2010-09-18T10:42:17  <ntroPi> so someone with enough accounts could make some wins for the top placed not count
2010-09-18T10:42:23  <s_denchev> so you shouldn`t bother about losing a point or two
2010-09-18T10:42:26  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: s_denchev is right. these don't count in the long run
2010-09-18T10:42:35  <ntroPi> ah well then :-)
2010-09-18T10:42:37  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: multiple accounts are explicitly not allowed
2010-09-18T10:42:51  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: and it's not very helpful to have multiple accounts anyway
2010-09-18T10:42:59  <ntroPi> yea and murder is not allowed ... that's why it never happens :-D
2010-09-18T10:43:10  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: in order to hurt a top bot you would first have to have a bot that's good enough to play that many games against it
2010-09-18T10:43:21  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: the matching algorithm prefers to match bots with similar rank
2010-09-18T10:43:43  <ntroPi> and in elo wins against weak bots dont count for much as i remember ...
2010-09-18T10:43:46  <jmcarthur> and even if you do that... there's not much benefit in doing that trick
2010-09-18T10:43:50  <ntroPi> k shoulnd't be that bad then
2010-09-18T10:43:58  <jmcarthur> because all of your nice bots will have played against each other
2010-09-18T10:44:12  <jmcarthur> ntroPi: also, rank doesn't only go down when a bot is resubmitted
2010-09-18T10:44:14  <jmcarthur> it can also go up
2010-09-18T10:44:26  <ntroPi> well i could chek before which of them didn't play against my favourite.
2010-09-18T10:44:27  <contestbot> Top 10 players: McLeopold(3594), montanalow(3346), felixcoto(3321), Yhlonx(3314), dmj111(3291), Tracer(3261), ApmeM123(3245), EBraun(3228), smatcher(3208), Beanhome(3202)
2010-09-18T10:44:59  <jmcarthur> it would actually be a very difficult thing to get right, *assuming* you can coordinate it, and it will *still* be for nothing because this doesn't count
2010-09-18T10:45:09  <jmcarthur> the final tournament will not have any new submissions for its entire duration
2010-09-18T10:45:29  <ntroPi> great. :-) Just noticed.
2010-09-18T10:48:29  <ntroPi> ... i could watch top matches all day intead of working on my bot ;)

2010-09-18T11:06:46  <antimatroid1> sigh: they did something like that last time
2010-09-18T11:06:59  <antimatroid1> but the started packages seem to have been updated every day or two this time
2010-09-18T11:07:16  <sigh> i see
2010-09-18T11:07:27  <sigh> i wasn't involved last time
2010-09-18T11:07:41  <antimatroid1> also if they are to do that, they can't really do it yet
2010-09-18T11:07:53  <antimatroid1> as it encourages people to participate getting on right away and watching a few games
2010-09-18T11:08:20  <antimatroid1> sigh: careful with your timer, if you timeout in final tournament your bot gets disabled
2010-09-18T11:08:26  <antimatroid1> happened to me last time, sucked
2010-09-18T11:08:27  <hakand> well, nothing changes from the user side of view
2010-09-18T11:08:46  <sigh> my timer is fine, my bot takes less than 1ms on most moves
2010-09-18T11:09:00  <antimatroid1> i didn't even realise that wasn't just a loss until it happened :|
2010-09-18T11:09:08  <sigh> I've never timed out on the main site
2010-09-18T11:09:08  <kcn1700> if someone submits start bots, without playing game, the results are ready.
2010-09-18T11:09:10  <antimatroid1> yeah cool, so does mine so far
2010-09-18T11:09:20  <antimatroid1> first move is still under 1.2 seconds
2010-09-18T11:09:57  <sigh> shouldn't that be under 1 second?
2010-09-18T11:10:20  <antimatroid1> 0.012 yeah sorry
2010-09-18T11:10:21  <antimatroid1> aha
2010-09-18T11:10:26  <sigh> :)
2010-09-18T11:10:33  <antimatroid1> although i'm pretty sure we get 3 seconds on first move again
2010-09-18T11:10:36  <antimatroid1> i read that somewhere
2010-09-18T11:10:48  <sigh> i see
2010-09-18T11:10:50  <sigh> it's only on tcp that I have issues
2010-09-18T11:10:59  <antimatroid1> yeah i've had them, but not as bad as you
2010-09-18T11:11:04  <antimatroid1> i get about 500ms pings
2010-09-18T11:11:07  <sigh> even locally I set my timeout to 200ms and never had any issues
2010-09-18T11:11:41  * Naktibalda had up to 1000s, it was impossible to run bot locally
2010-09-18T11:11:46  <Naktibalda> err, ms
2010-09-18T11:11:49  <sigh> lol

2010-09-18T11:13:30  <danielvf> ntroPi: Stop playing
2010-09-18T11:13:35  <kcn1700> but maps vary, so I've doubt about the effect of caching start bots.
2010-09-18T11:13:39  <antimatroid1> ntroPi: it would stop

2010-09-18T11:17:46  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: the spec says three, but i've had a patch in the queue to fix it because it's wrong
2010-09-18T11:18:14  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: there are two seconds for "warmup" time, but they occur before the engine sends the first game state to the bot
2010-09-18T11:18:22  <jmcarthur> s
2010-09-18T11:19:03  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: so i can set up if i put it in the right place for an extra second?

2010-09-18T11:19:49  <ntroPi> it's just needed for java bots :-P
2010-09-18T11:20:33  <antimatroid1> are they fixing it at 23 planets or not?

2010-09-18T11:56:29  <antimatroid1> that is annoying
2010-09-18T11:56:33  <amstan> what?
2010-09-18T11:57:09  <antimatroid1> they're not actually going for enemies planets, or whatever is meant to do that is marking them all off as not to attack
2010-09-18T11:57:13  <a1k0n> i don't.  it just sends 20 ships all over teh place and fails to go in for the kill
2010-09-18T11:57:32  <a1k0n> yeah, perhaps
2010-09-18T11:57:35  <antimatroid1> yeah, either it's not checking about taking enemies, or the check for it is marking them as bad moves
2010-09-18T11:57:45  <antimatroid1> i've had it like that when debugging
2010-09-18T11:58:05  <a1k0n> it does actually attack enemy planets.  sorta.
2010-09-18T11:58:32  <antimatroid1> only with fleets going in
2010-09-18T11:58:51  <antimatroid1> so i think it's accounting for those ships, but not going for something just owned by the enemy
2010-09-18T11:58:53  <jmcarthur> what is this i don't even
2010-09-18T11:59:15  <antimatroid1> it's bots like that which will slow teh server down most
2010-09-18T11:59:30  <antimatroid1> and starter bots playing starter bots
2010-09-18T11:59:47  <a1k0n> yeah it takes forever to play against him
2010-09-18T11:59:56  <antimatroid1> although presumably they would all make their moves pretty fast
2010-09-18T12:00:35  <pgpaskar_> i need to set up an awaylog
2010-09-18T12:00:44  <pgpaskar_> i keep getting highlighted and not know who/where/when it was

2010-09-18T12:21:40  <antimatroid1> damnit, i was about to go to bed, now i've had another fairly easy to implement strategy idea
2010-09-18T12:21:50  <antimatroid1> good thing i've got red bulls in the fridge
2010-09-18T12:22:12  <jmcarthur> the day i stopped drinking red bull was the day i started losing weight
2010-09-18T12:22:25  <bartwe> a1k0n: what do you mean ?
2010-09-18T12:22:39  <jmcarthur> i didn't even expect to lose weight from dropping red bull
2010-09-18T12:23:12  <antimatroid1> i don't usually drink it, but i picked up an 8 pack for the weekend
2010-09-18T12:23:16  <jmcarthur> but i've lost 15 pounds in a little over a month
2010-09-18T12:23:25  <jmcarthur> well
2010-09-18T12:23:27  <antimatroid1> wow, i got an unkown exception from tcp server

2010-09-18T12:23:51  <jmcarthur> i didn't even drink that much
2010-09-18T12:23:58  <danielvf> jmcarthur: What are you going to do with tarbars of game data?
2010-09-18T12:24:33  <amstan> danielvf: what's the state of the distribution?
2010-09-18T12:24:41  <jmcarthur> danielvf: public tarballs would mean we can make pretty graphs, do data mining for researching our bots, etc.
2010-09-18T12:24:45  <antimatroid1> anyone else getting unknown errors on tcp atm?
2010-09-18T12:24:52  <bartwe> a1k0n: #1 elo relative to dualbot

2010-09-18T12:25:46  <a1k0n> bartwe: yeah, so that you get a graph of how "objectively good" the best bot is over time

2010-09-18T12:26:11  <a1k0n> to see how the state of the art advances, etc

2010-09-18T12:26:24  <jmcarthur> danielvf: the idea when we discussed it before was to distribute via bittorrent to save bandwidth
2010-09-18T12:26:35  <bartwe> a1k0n: i try to do that for myself by keeping all the point relaeses, and keeping some of them running on benzedrine

2010-09-18T12:58:56  <danielvf> New idea:
2010-09-18T12:59:00  <danielvf> Megalotragus tests your bot as you develop it.
2010-09-18T12:59:00  <danielvf> Watch a replay on benzine, the real server, or your local visualizer. Press a button on a turn that your bot made a mistake. Megalotragus will grab the current game state, then ask you what your bot should or should not have done in response.
2010-09-18T12:59:00  <danielvf> After that every time you save changes to your bot, Megalotragus will test your bot against all those situations, and display a nice chart showing your bot's success or failure on each.
2010-09-18T13:00:34  <phreeza> nice
2010-09-18T13:01:35  <phreeza> but what if your bot has a random component
2010-09-18T13:01:51  <danielvf> Good point
2010-09-18T13:01:56  <phreeza> or path depentent behaviour, ie learns from the oponents previous actions
2010-09-18T13:02:14  <danielvf> Good points all.

2010-09-18T13:16:48  <amstan> so.. like.. there's no way for them to change
2010-09-18T13:16:53  <phreeza> ah i see
2010-09-18T13:16:58  <phreeza> hehehe
2010-09-18T13:17:07  <danielvf> Portland's organization id was set to to the same ID as "Other"
2010-09-18T13:17:13  <danielvf> Causing new signups to stop
2010-09-18T13:17:18  <danielvf> and other chaos.
2010-09-18T13:17:59  <amstan> danielvf: in similar situations in the future, can  you just execute an sql query that fixes everyone?
2010-09-18T13:18:01  <dstufft> ID isn't unique?
2010-09-18T13:18:14  <amstan> but hold on

2010-09-18T13:18:26  <amstan> it should of been 0
2010-09-18T13:18:50  <danielvf> amstan: Because both other and portland uni were set to 81

2010-09-18T13:19:02  <amstan> danielvf: no... other with id 81 should not exist
2010-09-18T13:19:11  <danielvf> Oh?

2010-09-18T13:21:09  <amstan> dstufft: because of poor db design

2010-09-18T13:25:44  <Janzert> the org_id should just be set as the primary key for the organizations table
2010-09-18T13:27:09  <Janzert> and really probably also be set to "NOT NULL auto_increment"
2010-09-18T13:27:41  <amstan> i added not null and auto_increment last time i added like 30 orgs in it
2010-09-18T13:27:54  <amstan> it really should be a table that is not touched by humans..
2010-09-18T13:28:10  <Janzert> ahh, good. the schema file is just out of date

2010-09-18T13:28:56  <dstufft> what took you 2 hours?
2010-09-18T13:29:23  <amstan> to download the db, clear the users, find out a way to transfer the db to another db, then reexport it to an sql
2010-09-18T13:29:46  <amstan> i was also doing that while my internet was working at 10kbps
2010-09-18T13:32:54  <Janzert> to make it easier if someone attempts it again I think a mysqldump with --no-data option will do it
2010-09-18T13:33:47  <a1k0n> though the organizations and countries need to be populated, so dump them separately

2010-09-18T13:50:06  <Naktibalda> it takes time to reach a correct rank
2010-09-18T13:51:45  <jmcarthur> just beating your old bot doesn't mean it's strictly better, either
2010-09-18T13:51:58  <gerard> yep, that's what I'm afraid
2010-09-18T13:53:40  <Naktibalda> when I compared my new version to old, new version won 70 maps out of 100
2010-09-18T13:54:43  <gerard> yep, that's my case too, but you can still do a bot that is only good at beating your old bot
2010-09-18T13:55:06  <gerard> nevertheless my new one is also better at beating DualBot and RageBot
2010-09-18T13:55:43  <gerard> but I've been testing with 300 turns (stupid me)
2010-09-18T13:56:09  <Naktibalda> shouldn't matter a lot
2010-09-18T13:56:14  <gerard> I've lost one tournament game that I could have won in 300 turns

2010-09-18T14:18:22  <fahi> Hey, is there any way to see the exceptions thrown server-side when my bot plays? My bot works locally and no exceptions are thrown, but on the server it dies in the middle of the game.
2010-09-18T14:19:03  <gerard> fahi: I'm afraid not, I'm also having the same problem
2010-09-18T14:19:09  <Lafi> just double check your orders before sending them
2010-09-18T14:19:14  <Lafi> and see if the error goes away
2010-09-18T14:19:47  <gerard> yep, that's a starting point
2010-09-18T14:20:05  <Lafi> make sure you don't send more ships than you have or you don't try to send ships from planet to the same planet
2010-09-18T14:20:25  <fahi> I actually check that
2010-09-18T14:20:55  <Lafi> I briefly had a problem if a planet tried to send two fleets in the same turn and it didn't update numShips in that planet between fleets

2010-09-18T14:46:55  <odinsbane> the tcp server groups fleets, does the main server also do that?
2010-09-18T14:47:52  <genericbob> It does now.
2010-09-18T14:48:57  <Zannick> a1k0n: hey, so i tested out that ceilsqrt function i wrote last night
2010-09-18T14:49:06  <Zannick> it does much, much worse than ceil(sqrt())

2010-09-18T14:50:13  <jmcarthur> are you really going to be spending that much time on (ceil . sqrt) anyway?

2010-09-18T14:50:54  <jmcarthur> woops
2010-09-18T14:51:13  <jmcarthur> you could have, you know, copied it from the math library
2010-09-18T14:51:24  <Zannick> i thought i would try being clever
2010-09-18T14:51:29  <Utkarsh> is it possible to get more info as to why my bot couldn't even play 1 chance in any game? it works fine on my pc, and the tcp server.
2010-09-18T14:52:34  <Zannick> is the tcp server telling you you're sending invalid commands?
2010-09-18T14:53:08  <Utkarsh> it used to. but i fixed that (sending ships from planet x to x)

2010-09-18T15:07:54  <Naktibalda> Versions of supported programming languages should be listed somewhere on site
2010-09-18T15:07:55  <coventry> dhartmei_: Any chance you could version your bots on the tcp server?

2010-09-18T15:13:50  <coventry> Thanks.  It will make the developments easier to follow.  I was imagining that your bot's early choice to attack bartwe in http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=27050 reflected an experimental change in strategy, but I guess I guessed wrong. :-)

2010-09-18T16:06:00  <naglijo> thank you for fixing that
2010-09-18T16:06:46  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: ohhh I get what you meant about bartwe - you not only have to track the fleets target, but also the surrounding planets (harder to predict the total str)
2010-09-18T16:06:59  <Naktibalda> Cyndre: whats your average number of turns against bots?
2010-09-18T16:07:12  <Cyndre> 60 - 120 against the first 2
2010-09-18T16:07:40  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: right. you have to speculate about next moves and stuff
2010-09-18T16:07:47  <jmcarthur> fortunately the pattern is at least easy to see
2010-09-18T16:08:04  <jmcarthur> it's just a matter of "seeing" it programmatically. and special casing your bot might be a waste of time :\
2010-09-18T16:08:23  <jmcarthur> the top 50 seem to have no trouble anyway
2010-09-18T16:09:04  <jmcarthur> i really hope my bot will be as efficient as my estimates seem to imply
2010-09-18T16:09:24  <Cyndre> just uploaded a new bot
2010-09-18T16:09:58  <jmcarthur> my bot will take a lot of memory, like it did in tron :\
2010-09-18T16:10:04  <jmcarthur> but not *as* much at least
2010-09-18T16:10:14  <Cyndre> I think when I submitted my old bot was playing a game (from submit to profile and I had a loss of a 115 turn game)
2010-09-18T16:10:33  <jmcarthur> heh

2010-09-18T16:13:40  <fahi> I'm only printing to stderr :)
2010-09-18T16:13:46  <Cyndre> look for the patern I said
2010-09-18T16:14:02  <Cyndre> then change it so it doesnt have 3 words and 2 spaces
2010-09-18T16:14:08  <Naktibalda> :)))
2010-09-18T16:14:12  <rwa> finally have a bot that at least contends with dhartmei
2010-09-18T16:14:22  <Cyndre> and next is verify source/target planet owners, num ships

2010-09-18T16:34:11  <Zannick> i like to laugh at how sloccount estimates how much it cost to develop what i write
2010-09-18T16:34:25  <jmcarthur> Zannick: i know! it's horrible
2010-09-18T16:34:31  <phreeza> i'm trying more explicit aproaches anyway
2010-09-18T16:34:48  <Zannick> my current, unfinished bot, of 256 lines of c, cost an estimated $6461
2010-09-18T16:35:03  <jmcarthur> i am simply mixing a few ideas in, i hope, an intelligent way
2010-09-18T16:35:05  <phreeza> but in general i'm interested in emergent methods

2010-09-18T16:37:18  <Zannick> what's implemented so far is probably correct :)
2010-09-18T16:37:34  <Zannick> still, that is more than i make in a month
2010-09-18T16:37:50  <jmcarthur> costs include overhead, not just wages and benefits
2010-09-18T16:37:54  <Zannick> and those 256 lines took me only a couple days to write
2010-09-18T16:38:00  <phreeza> ah... but which employer would actually pay you 6k$ for 256 lines of C?

2010-09-18T17:20:37  <justin_pdx> Okay, I need to avoid doing that though.  It's funny to see the 0's flying around on my local machine.
2010-09-18T17:20:54  <Areku> um yeah
2010-09-18T17:21:21  <Areku> remember the strategy when you send out so many fleets that your opponent can't process them all and times out?
2010-09-18T17:21:58  <DirtyKeyboard> Areku: :) I plotted doing that until finding out that it was blocked... and for good reason
2010-09-18T17:22:02  <justin_pdx> Well that' wasn't my intent.
2010-09-18T17:22:27  <DirtyKeyboard> btw, bartwe, I envy your bots
2010-09-18T17:22:29  <justin_pdx> I was just sending out growth_rate - 1.
2010-09-18T17:22:42  <Areku> what if growth rate is 0?
2010-09-18T17:22:42  <bartwe> thanks
2010-09-18T17:22:51  <bartwe> personally i feel they aren't strong enough
2010-09-18T17:22:55  <DirtyKeyboard> Areku: that shouldn't happen
2010-09-18T17:23:07  <bartwe> i only rank 44 in the main contest
2010-09-18T17:23:08  <Areku> I've had it in one of my matches
2010-09-18T17:23:15  <DirtyKeyboard> I beat a couple of them once... but some versions just spank me
2010-09-18T17:23:26  <greghaynes> Why growth rate - 1?
2010-09-18T17:23:42  <Areku> heh I wish I ranked 144 :D
2010-09-18T17:23:50  <greghaynes> Ive been trying to figure out why people do that
2010-09-18T17:23:56  <DirtyKeyboard> Areku: there'd literally be no reason to go for that planet... :-\
2010-09-18T17:24:11  <Areku> staging point
2010-09-18T17:24:31  <Areku> but yeah, kinda useless

2010-09-18T17:25:20  <Areku> kinda found out I forgot to account for growth rate, so did my opponent
2010-09-18T17:25:30  <justin_pdx> greghaynes: If a planet had no good target to attack, it would send ships to a "hub" while building up a defensive force at the rate of 1 per turn.
2010-09-18T17:25:30  <Areku> so we both fought over a useless rock, yay :D

2010-09-18T17:25:46  <greghaynes> ah...
2010-09-18T17:26:09  <Areku> what makes a good hub?
2010-09-18T17:26:21  <greghaynes> Close to the next planet you want to attack
2010-09-18T17:26:25  <greghaynes> Thats the only property
2010-09-18T17:26:28  * Naktibalda has rank 45
2010-09-18T17:27:00  <justin_pdx> I have two hubs.  One is "the planet closest to the mean of the area my_planets cover" so, roughly my middle.
2010-09-18T17:27:01  <Areku> only my first day :D
2010-09-18T17:27:23  <greghaynes> Go more offensive!
2010-09-18T17:27:46  <justin_pdx> Another hub is "the planet I own closest to the mean location of my center and enemy center" and I call it battle_front.
2010-09-18T17:28:01  <greghaynes> heh
2010-09-18T17:28:01  <Areku> cheers mate :D
2010-09-18T17:28:19  <justin_pdx> But I think that these hubs are naive.
2010-09-18T17:28:25  <Areku> I could tell you what I use, but it's going to be embarasing
2010-09-18T17:28:37  <Areku> operation bumrush - attack closest planet
2010-09-18T17:28:39  <justin_pdx> I'd rather be weighting the "center" by the number of ships.
2010-09-18T17:28:42  <greghaynes> from python import planetwars

2010-09-18T17:28:57  <greghaynes> er, from future
2010-09-18T17:29:10  <Areku> no, that's not how you use it
2010-09-18T17:29:22  <justin_pdx> But mostly right now I'm just seeing if I can implement simple strats, just to learn how it works and to see if I can do it.
2010-09-18T17:29:25  <Cyndre_> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getplayer?player=Cyndre2
2010-09-18T17:29:26  <Areku> planetwars.win(a) where a is the probability you want to win at
2010-09-18T17:29:28  <justin_pdx> Build confidence and complexity slowly.
2010-09-18T17:29:29  <Cyndre_> much better :)
2010-09-18T17:29:56  <Naktibalda> Areku: actually my bot is using the same tactic
2010-09-18T17:30:08  <greghaynes> justin_pdx: What language?
2010-09-18T17:30:11  <Naktibalda> the closest planet that I have enough ships to capture
2010-09-18T17:30:23  <justin_pdx> Ruby.
2010-09-18T17:30:26  <greghaynes> ah
2010-09-18T17:30:51  <greghaynes> Theres a couple nice utility methods I worked on the first couple days that have made tweaking my bot so much easier
2010-09-18T17:30:58  <Areku> yeah, except that when in bumrush mode mine doesn't care about wining :D
2010-09-18T17:31:12  <greghaynes> Like planet.StrengthAfter(n_turns)
2010-09-18T17:31:54  <DirtyKeyboard> greghaynes: I have a function like that, but it also changes ownership. :)
2010-09-18T17:32:13  <Areku> um
2010-09-18T17:32:27  <Cyndre_> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=34038  you can see my sucker punch working now - yay
2010-09-18T17:32:27  <greghaynes> This does also
2010-09-18T17:33:03  <greghaynes> Its a bit complex also, takes into acout varying growth rates based in ownership changes in interim
2010-09-18T17:33:24  <greghaynes> Once you have that its all downhill ;)

2010-09-18T17:40:02  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: you mean src == dst?
2010-09-18T17:40:16  <justin_pdx> Yes.
2010-09-18T17:40:26  <Naktibalda> I still find it silly to send a stream of small fleets when you have enough ships in planet to send a big fleet
2010-09-18T17:40:28  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: that is explicitly illegal i think, for the record
2010-09-18T17:40:54  <justin_pdx> Yeah I didn't mean to, I just couldn't figure out what was wrong.  The java playgame isn't as strict.
2010-09-18T17:42:13  <jmcarthur> IMO any local engine should be at *least* as strict as the server

2010-09-18T17:47:38  <Areku> cheers

2010-09-18T17:48:36  <Naktibalda> I think that you need a shell script to launch hava

2010-09-18T17:48:49  <justin_pdx> I don't think so, I think the last param has to be an executable file.

2010-09-18T18:32:14  <Arekku> my combat resolver can only handle 2 factions
2010-09-18T18:33:26  <Zaphus> hmm, getting "server not found" at ai-contest.com

2010-09-18T18:33:39  <Naktibalda> my bot played 2 games in 7 second interval in ai-contest :)
2010-09-18T18:33:46  <Naktibalda> must be a bug :)
2010-09-18T18:33:55  <Arekku> yep
2010-09-18T18:34:47  <Arekku> so, what happened was that my AI thought it was going to win that planet, and from there it just went downhill :(

2010-09-18T18:35:36  <pjreddie> can't do 3 or 4 player probably?
2010-09-18T18:35:51  <Arekku> yep
2010-09-18T18:36:02  <pjreddie> or maybe players attacking neutral at the same time
2010-09-18T18:36:10  <pjreddie> which sucks to code
2010-09-18T18:36:11  <Arekku> so when me, enemy and neutral are fighting for a planet the results are unpredicatable
2010-09-18T18:36:19  <sigh> ahhh
2010-09-18T18:36:26  <Arekku> neutrals at the same time thingie
2010-09-18T18:36:34  <Arekku> which is why I lost that game
2010-09-18T18:36:46  <sigh> yeah, attacking neutrals at the same time make my simulation code messy
2010-09-18T18:37:38  <Arekku> but you managed to find a way around it at least
2010-09-18T18:37:52  <jmcarthur> it's easy to handle all kind of cases with one simple function
2010-09-18T18:38:25  <Zaphus> can anyone else see ai-contest.com ?  or is it the crappy wireless internet I'm on that's causing me issues ?
2010-09-18T18:38:37  <Arekku> Current Rank: 134 in before the drop back down to 700 :D
2010-09-18T18:38:45  <jmcarthur> group forces, sort by numbers, pick top two, if same result is 0 for original owner, if different winner is top and he has best-secondbest ships

2010-09-18T18:39:29  <sigh>  jmcarthur: exactly what I do... but I consider that messy compared to the other battles :P
2010-09-18T18:39:48  <Arekku> Is there an easy way to sort a list in java?
2010-09-18T18:39:53  <pjreddie> haha yeah i keep making modifications, but my old bot still beats it ><
2010-09-18T18:40:01  <Arekku> so I can sort the fleets in order of arrival
2010-09-18T18:40:02  <jmcarthur> sigh: just do the same for all battles
2010-09-18T18:40:21  <jmcarthur> even non-battles (player reinforcing his own planet)
2010-09-18T18:40:36  <jmcarthur> it's not messy :P
2010-09-18T18:41:15  <Arekku> Yeah I'll do that mod and resubmit
2010-09-18T18:41:20  <pjreddie> Arreku: alright if you're taking the plunge so am i... 700 here i come.
2010-09-18T18:41:36  <sigh> jmcarthur: yes, but where it gets tricky is when I have an existing simulation and I doing calculations based on it, like how many extra ships I will need to take over a planet
2010-09-18T18:42:00  <sigh> given all incoming fleets
2010-09-18T18:42:11  <jmcarthur> you only need enough to beat the next largest force
2010-09-18T18:42:20  <jmcarthur> you can completely ignore the weakest
2010-09-18T18:42:31  <jmcarthur> and then it's the same as for just two forces
2010-09-18T18:42:53  <Arekku> brilliant
2010-09-18T18:43:08  <rwa> who has wtfbbq
2010-09-18T18:43:12  <Arekku> what i do is keep an array of the troop balance though
2010-09-18T18:43:20  <sigh> maybe I just suck at programming :D
2010-09-18T18:43:31  <jmcarthur> Arekku: "troop balance"?
2010-09-18T18:43:57  <Arekku> sorry it's just what i call it
2010-09-18T18:44:15  <jmcarthur> i just don't know what you mean
2010-09-18T18:44:25  <sigh> #ships on each planet?
2010-09-18T18:44:31  <contestbot> Top 10 players: McLeopold(3594), montanalow(3346), felixcoto(3321), Yhlonx(3314), dmj111(3291), Tracer(3261), ApmeM123(3245), EBraun(3228), smatcher(3208), Beanhome(3202)
2010-09-18T18:44:44  <Arekku> troop balance = my ships - enemy ships (for the turn)
2010-09-18T18:44:45  <sigh> ah, back out of the top 10
2010-09-18T18:44:50  <sigh> ah
2010-09-18T18:44:54  <jmcarthur> ah

2010-09-18T18:45:14  <Arekku> so if troop balance in 10 turns is -45, I need to send 46
2010-09-18T18:45:34  <davidkelly999> sigh: whatever you're doing must be working pretty well if you're around the top 10. I'm hoping one day to crack the top 100 (I feel pretty good about this newest update though..)
2010-09-18T18:46:00  <Arekku> or rather, if I send reinforcements that'll arrive in 10 turns, I check the troop balance in 10 turns and send an appropriate amount
2010-09-18T18:46:08  <jmcarthur> i love it when my bots beat old versions of themselves
2010-09-18T18:46:15  <Arekku> same

2010-09-18T20:39:47  <a1k0n> i at least have analyzed a game and figured out what my bot is doing wrong, which is generally kind of hard to do
2010-09-18T20:40:14  <a1k0n> still no idea why a1k0n-0.2 is so good

2010-09-18T20:40:49  <rwa> I see patterns and can usually ferret out why bot my bot does badly in certain scenarios
2010-09-18T20:41:03  <rwa> patching up those holes without messing up the behavior I want is not so easy
2010-09-18T20:41:32  <rwa> without messing up the rest of the behavior that's already working well that is...
2010-09-18T20:42:19  <rwa> for example I had a bot which whipped RageBot like a little bitch, but it was terrible on benzedrine.  It was too specific in what it was trying to counter.
2010-09-18T20:43:06  <a1k0n> mine rolls over ragebot and a1k0n-0.2 like they aren't even there but generally sucks on benzedrine.cx
2010-09-18T20:43:29  <a1k0n> not because it's not too specific, but because it's as naÃ¯ve as the bots it's designed to kill
2010-09-18T20:43:43  <a1k0n> er, too many nots there
2010-09-18T20:44:23  <a1k0n> anyway i have a competitive approach in mind now, so yay.  we'll see.

2010-09-18T20:48:10  <rwa> any idea why benzedrine tends to do multiple matches against the same bot?

2010-09-18T20:48:45  <sigh> because it just matches you against the available person who is closest to your rank

2010-09-18T22:34:57  <justin_pdx> I am having trouble understanding the resolution of turn 44 and 45 of this game: http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=35796
2010-09-18T22:35:37  <justin_pdx> There is a planet in the upper right that is neutral, with two large fleets from each faction coming in.
2010-09-18T22:36:18  <amstan> justin_pdx: i don't see it
2010-09-18T22:37:11  <Cyndre_> he has 52, I have 56, neutral has 49
2010-09-18T22:37:12  *** Zeiris <Zeiris!~Zeiris@d206-116-158-135.bchsia.telus.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-18T22:37:40  <Cyndre_> those ships should hav been a turn behind though
2010-09-18T22:38:34  <Cyndre_> but still 52 ships are unaccounted for
2010-09-18T22:38:43  <justin_pdx> I just don't understand how the game resoloves that conflict.
2010-09-18T22:39:31  <justin_pdx> Cyndre_: Exactly, some ships are missing or something.  UNLESS it deducts the amount of neutral ships from EACH incoming fleet.
2010-09-18T22:39:43  <Cyndre_> then were missing ships still
2010-09-18T22:39:48  <Cyndre_> but only 6
2010-09-18T22:40:46  <Cyndre_> hmmm I think I have my order mixed up
2010-09-18T22:40:47  <Zannick> 3-way battles like that are resolved as the winner minus the second place
2010-09-18T22:40:49  <justin_pdx> So you agree that something is fishy there?
2010-09-18T22:41:00  <Zannick> red 56, blue 46, neutral 49
2010-09-18T22:41:10  <Zannick> so it ends up as 56-49 = 7 for red
2010-09-18T22:41:11  <Cyndre_> 53 for blue
2010-09-18T22:41:33  <Zannick> where are you getting that?
2010-09-18T22:41:38  <Zannick> that's a 1, not a 7
2010-09-18T22:41:42  <Cyndre_> oh
2010-09-18T22:41:59  <Cyndre_> so where did blues 46 ships go
2010-09-18T22:42:08  <justin_pdx> Okay, just curious.  I'll need to take that kind of conflict into account.
2010-09-18T22:42:24  <Zannick> like i said, a three-way conflict is simultaneous
2010-09-18T22:43:03  <Zannick> think of it in rounds
2010-09-18T22:43:08  <Zannick> each round each player loses a ship
2010-09-18T22:43:19  <Zannick> until one player is left
2010-09-18T22:43:39  <justin_pdx> So blue just wasted it's ships, massively.
2010-09-18T22:43:42  <Zannick> after 46 rounds, blue is out of the combat
2010-09-18T22:43:43  <Cyndre_> that makes my ships twice as valuable that way
2010-09-18T22:43:47  <Zannick> yeah, basically
2010-09-18T22:44:25  <Zannick> that 45 one turn later would have saved him about 30 ships
2010-09-18T22:44:25  <Cyndre_> showing up like that is a bad idea
2010-09-18T22:44:44  <Zannick> unless you are stronger than the enemy :)
2010-09-18T22:44:56  <Zannick> (interesting strategy...)
2010-09-18T22:45:17  <Cyndre_> its horrible
2010-09-18T22:45:48  <justin_pdx> Yeah either player showing up one turn later would have been smart, but since Red's fleet was in flight first, blue shouldn't have sent that 45 (or it should have sent that 18 one faster).
2010-09-18T22:46:56  <justin_pdx> Thank you Zannick.

2010-09-18T23:36:39  <McLeopold> Anyone here capable of diagnosing forum registration issues?
2010-09-18T23:36:48  <amstan> McLeopold: sure
2010-09-18T23:36:51  <amstan> McLeopold: what's up?
2010-09-18T23:37:08  <amstan> you still in top? if you're not, i can't help you...
2010-09-18T23:37:12  <amstan> contestbot: rankings 3

2010-09-18T23:37:40  *** xvinyl <xvinyl!~xvinyl@AVelizy-153-1-60-153.w86-217.abo.wanadoo.fr> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-09-18T23:37:44  <McLeopold> Apparently just whining on this forum fixed my issue.
2010-09-18T23:38:19  <amstan> McLeopold: what issue did you have?
2010-09-18T23:38:39  <McLeopold> Registering for the forums was getting a timeout.  It just worked so I'm okay.
2010-09-18T23:39:23  <amstan> yeah, the server's working pretty hard now
2010-09-18T23:40:29  <sigh> amstan: would server load cause some bots to timeout?
2010-09-18T23:40:46  <amstan> yeah... that would be a problem
2010-09-18T23:41:11  <sigh> a couple hours ago I lost 2 games on the first move
2010-09-18T23:41:20  <amstan> oh well, we're getting more servers soon
2010-09-18T23:41:26  <sigh> :)
2010-09-18T23:43:16  <McLeopold> I've had some odd problems with first turn loses.  They have all turned out to be bugs so far.

2010-09-18T23:48:39  <sigh> McLeopold: what sort of bugs? invalid moves, or timeouts?
2010-09-18T23:52:51  <McLeopold> Invalid moves, such as negative fleets.
2010-09-18T23:53:31  <McLeopold> Also some divide by zeros.
2010-09-18T23:53:42  <sigh> yeah, I've got checks for most of those conditions right before out output my orders to stdout
2010-09-18T23:53:51  <rwa> amstan:  woot!
2010-09-18T23:53:59  <McLeopold> I added that in, just in case.
2010-09-18T23:53:59  <sigh> yes, div0 is a bit trickier :)
2010-09-18T23:54:00  <amstan> rwa: hmm?
2010-09-18T23:55:35  <rwa> amstan: more servers soon
2010-09-18T23:55:49  <rwa> amstan:  good news

2010-09-18T23:56:37  <pjreddie> server does actual clock time, not cycles?

2010-09-18T23:57:24  <jmcarthur> pjreddie: right :(
2010-09-18T23:57:35  <amstan> if you guys can figure out ways to do it, go right ahead
