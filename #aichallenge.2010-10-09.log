2010-10-09T00:03:40  <jmcarthur> crowbot is basically an advanced ragebot, according to mcleopold
2010-10-09T00:04:47  <amstan> contestbot: later tell McLeopold Use "creeper" as your next codename for your bot. It's the most dreaded mob in minecraft.
2010-10-09T00:04:47  <contestbot> amstan: I think that worked...

2010-10-09T01:51:54  <Frontier> sigh: When I started working on my bot I thought it would be especially slow moving and defensive. So I named it turtle. It is far more aggressive now and likes to attack enemy planets with lots of ships-
2010-10-09T01:53:25  <sigh> :)
2010-10-09T01:53:29  <Frontier> Next I code a replay-player for my server so I can rerun games from the TCP server and check why my bot is doing some wrong decisions. (Despite the lack of good heuristics like in McLeopolds case)
2010-10-09T01:53:47  <sigh> yeah, that's useful

2010-10-09T01:55:49  <sigh> cool, not doing too bad
2010-10-09T01:56:03  <sigh> I think your bot would be a lot better if it moved units to the front
2010-10-09T01:56:11  <Frontier> I once had a match where I had considerably more ships, but the enemy had a few 1-growth planets more than me. My bot kept attacking his well defended larger planets instead of just taking two of the 1-growth planets that were only 2 and 3 turns away from me, but a huge leap from the enemy
2010-10-09T01:56:36  <sigh> yes, planet selection is HARD
2010-10-09T01:57:23  <sigh> if I could figure out a good way just for selecting planets my bot would be considerably stronger

2010-10-09T01:59:41  <Frontier> I kinda hacked in that it moves ships from the backyard to the front if it is 100% save. Just so matches where I already win end faster. It took me lots of time to get my bot to make good choices in the beginning. It still needs to understand that if it is a neutral just a bit closer to the enemy, then it is useless to attack, because I will just waste ships on it and lose it afterwards.

2010-10-09T02:00:32  <sigh> ah, that neutral thing I just explicitly check for
2010-10-09T02:00:47  <sigh> my bot is too stupid to figure that out itself
2010-10-09T02:01:29  <Frontier> sigh: I tried to come up with 4 to 5 more or less distinct scores for each planet. I multiply these to get the final score. Then I tweak my bot by doing "pow(score1, 0.5)" or something so certain scores get more weight than others.
2010-10-09T02:02:45  <sigh> hmm... that sounds complicated :S
2010-10-09T02:02:47  <Frontier> My bot on rank 133 is still the one I hacked together in 2 days. Sometimes 'explicit checks' aren't that bad. They are less likely to fail in special situations.

2010-10-09T02:03:28  <sigh> I also score planets independently, but it is just a simple function of growth_rate, distance and cost
2010-10-09T02:03:36  <Frontier> sigh: I learned that in my job as a browser game developer
2010-10-09T02:03:52  <sigh> (where cost is how many ships are need to take the planet)
2010-10-09T02:04:09  <sigh> cool, what sort of games do you make?

2010-10-09T02:07:04  <Frontier> There are tourists considering several activities, each of which has attributes like its category (sport, party, ...), the quality of the location, the renovation state, the distance, etc... and it is pretty much like in PlanetWars where you have ships that look for planets to have a good time.

2010-10-09T02:31:54  <Frontier> If I tested only 10 maps (1-10) I would have gone wrong. Yesterday I tested a new version and it won mostly on those maps, but lost often on the other 90.

2010-10-09T02:35:52  <Frontier> sigh: Right now testing agains my old version takes a little longer, becuase I don't have the sources no more so I have to spawn a sub process :O.

2010-10-09T02:37:52  <rwa> the rate of tech advancement is a little frustrating.  I can beat bots now that were in the top 3 not that long ago.  But this isn't good enough anymore.

2010-10-09T05:36:36  <Migi32> which bot are you looking at?
2010-10-09T05:37:12  <Migi32> ah yes I see it now in ProspectorBot
2010-10-09T05:37:19  <Migi32> so Titankiller what about it?
2010-10-09T05:38:51  <Titankiller> shouldn't 1+growth rate be in numerator if u're alculating strongest ?
2010-10-09T05:40:01  <sigh> Titankiller: this way higher growth rate planets are seen as more "valuable" since the start pack bots attack the weakest enemies
2010-10-09T05:40:21  <sigh> but definitely play around with the logic, and what difference it makes :)

2010-10-09T05:40:49  <Migi32> Titankiller, this is a very basic formula. What it really calculates is the number of ships ("cost") per growth-rate unit it gets

2010-10-09T05:44:16  <Titankiller> but the comment says its finding MY strongest planet
2010-10-09T05:44:51  <Migi32> Titankiller, the comment is misleading
2010-10-09T05:45:52  <Migi32> it's finding your planet with the highest score, which is the planet with the most ships (so the attack is strong) / growth-rate (it's no big deal to lose a planet with low growth-rate)
2010-10-09T05:46:12  <Migi32> get it?
2010-10-09T05:46:49  <Titankiller> yeah
2010-10-09T05:47:24  <Migi32> but as I said, it's by no means a good scoring function, you'll have to come up with better stuff to win this contest ;)
2010-10-09T05:47:24  <Titankiller> i guess i shuddelet all the comments nd get my head workng ;-)
2010-10-09T05:47:45  <Titankiller> oh yesi'm workng on it

2010-10-09T05:49:25  <Migi32> no
2010-10-09T05:49:34  <rabidus> hi
2010-10-09T05:49:36  <Migi32> you can add as many files and functions as you want
2010-10-09T05:50:14  <Migi32> the only restrictions are: you have to have MyBot.cc (or .java or w/e) with a main() function, and all files have to be in the same programming language
2010-10-09T05:51:35  <Titankiller> many thanks
2010-10-09T05:54:07  <Migi32> no problems

2010-10-09T06:03:49  <Frontier> COMPILER ERRORS
2010-10-09T06:03:49  <Frontier> 
2010-10-09T06:03:49  <Frontier> GameStateData.cpp:219:2: warning: no newline at end of file
2010-10-09T06:03:49  <Frontier> Orders.cpp:42:2: warning: no newline at end of file
2010-10-09T06:05:13  <Migi32> did it accept it anyway or not?
2010-10-09T06:06:09  <Frontier> No, it considered it a serious problem that there were no blank lines at the ends of my files - I hate blank lines at end of files :/
2010-10-09T06:06:28  <Frontier> It's like a habit to remove them whenever I find some
2010-10-09T06:07:28  <Migi32> Frontier, in cpp files you definitely shouldn't do that
2010-10-09T06:07:36  <Migi32> #include includes the file exactly as it is
2010-10-09T06:07:37  <contestbot> Migi32: User error, it's not my fault.
2010-10-09T06:07:45  <Migi32> shut up contestbot :P
2010-10-09T06:08:01  <Migi32> if the last line was a comment without a newline, the next line could end up getting commented as well
2010-10-09T06:08:12  <Frontier> contestbot, I understand that it is my fault -.-
2010-10-09T06:08:13  <contestbot> Frontier: Run as fast as you can and don't look back.
2010-10-09T06:08:45  <Frontier> Migi32, thanks for the info. I forgot about that.
2010-10-09T06:08:54  <Migi32> Frontier, no problem
2010-10-09T06:09:35  <Frontier> Now it seems like my bot isn't playing on the server. I checked it on my computer (using the same compiler arguments) before. Does that happen sometimes?
2010-10-09T06:09:59  <Migi32> your first game should happen seconds after your submission
2010-10-09T06:10:38  <Migi32> but there'll be some time before the second and further games
2010-10-09T06:10:47  <Frontier> Sure, what I meant was "It isn't making a move"
2010-10-09T06:11:25  <Migi32> you're not the only one with that problem. I'm not sure but I think it could be the server's fault
2010-10-09T06:12:02  <Frontier> I'll upload again and see if the problem continues.
2010-10-09T06:12:59  <Frontier> Maybe the compiler hadn't finished when the game started. ^^
2010-10-09T06:13:19  <Frontier> contestbot, what do you say?

2010-10-09T06:15:31  <Frontier> Oh that doesn't look good.

2010-10-09T08:32:24  <Frontier> Obeleh: C# is not so well supported on Linux, especially the contest server is using an old version of Mono. Under these circumstances I would have sticked with Java.
2010-10-09T08:33:20  <Obeleh> NearestItr is a class I wrote to iterate through planets starting with the nearest and going further
2010-10-09T08:33:50  <Obeleh> Yes I knew mono isn't that stable but I started with Java because there was no C# in the beginning
2010-10-09T08:34:28  <Obeleh> And I know C# better than java
2010-10-09T08:37:14  <Obeleh> Frontier: Aparently this could have been fixed with a patch: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588689
2010-10-09T08:39:13  <Frontier> I hope they update mono for you C# guys. It is a disadvantage. If the language wasn't able to produce fast enough code for the 1 second time limit that's one thing, but the code should at least compile ^^
2010-10-09T08:41:15  <Frontier> On another note I think about running automated test cases on my bot. I save a few game states in which my bot behaves odd, and when I think I fixed the issue I run it again against that game state and others I previously saved so I don't run into regressions.
2010-10-09T08:44:10  <Naktibalda> have you implemented any?
2010-10-09T08:45:05  <Naktibalda> starting conditions - planets, fleets, future orders, etc are huge, maintaining them can take a lot of time
2010-10-09T08:46:35  <Frontier> I have no future orders to save. I thought I could use the format that the server sends to the client on round start.
2010-10-09T08:46:40  <Naktibalda> well, results are smaller, just a few orders, but small changes to code can affect a lot of testcases
2010-10-09T08:47:33  <Frontier> From there on I could add a note "planet 4 or 6 should be attacked here" and let the bot decide if it wants to do that.
2010-10-09T08:48:07  <Naktibalda> later you can improve your bot to think that planet 8 is the best target
2010-10-09T08:48:23  <Naktibalda> or that he has to wait for 2 turns before attack
2010-10-09T08:48:52  <Frontier> hmm... so you think I would spend a lot of time fixing up or deleting obsolete test cases?
2010-10-09T08:49:14  * Naktibalda unit-tested XML generation this week, what a waste of time
2010-10-09T08:50:09  <Frontier> Then again maybe I wouldn't use a test case for decisions that aren't obvious.
2010-10-09T08:52:17  <Frontier> It's the situations where every human would ask why the bot isn't doing xy that give me head aches and I want to go sure I don't repeat such errors when I tune the bot.
2010-10-09T08:55:57  <Frontier> Something like "[don't] send x ships [from/to] planet y in the next z turn" should suffice for a test case.
2010-10-09T09:00:09  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(3823), felixcoto(3804), Hazard(3775), cfaftw(3718), ofrias(3700), sequoh(3680), davidjliu(3662), adumlah(3641), EBraun(3638), Mistmanovx(3614)
2010-10-09T09:01:20  <Frontier> Or another great idea: Everyone has this 'evaluate planet' function with a few constants to tune. How about predicting what planet the enemy will attack using this function and if the prediction was wrong, tune these constants until you can make a more reliable prediction of the enemy's moves.
2010-10-09T09:03:54  <delt0r_> Frontier: i do this
2010-10-09T09:04:07  <delt0r_> But i have too many parameters to tune
2010-10-09T09:04:32  <delt0r_> and i still have a bug in my prediction code... so it does stupid things at the end game
2010-10-09T09:04:36  <Frontier> So you use the constant function you use for yourself on the enemy?
2010-10-09T09:04:41  <delt0r_> yea
2010-10-09T09:04:48  <delt0r_> min/max kinda thing
2010-10-09T09:05:14  <delt0r_> but then i rank my descisions on possible counters
2010-10-09T09:05:36  <delt0r_> still without other hurisitcs it doesn't work well
2010-10-09T09:05:56  <Frontier> What language do you use?
2010-10-09T09:06:01  <delt0r_> so things like working out a front line and sending fleets there...
2010-10-09T09:06:07  <delt0r_> Java
2010-10-09T09:06:59  <Frontier> interesting, tuning the parameters might work for me, I'm using C++. After all, you can abort the tuning once you run out of time.
2010-10-09T09:06:59  <delt0r_> Its just what i have been using lately
2010-10-09T09:07:08  <delt0r_> yea
2010-10-09T09:07:13  <delt0r_> I do that
2010-10-09T09:07:25  <delt0r_> but i abort at 0.5 sec at this stage
2010-10-09T09:08:05  <Obeleh> you use that long?

2010-10-09T09:15:00  <oPless> I'm cutting some code at the moment that's taking a GA style approach, not sure how good it will be though :)
2010-10-09T09:16:23  <Frontier> I'm always spending at least 2 hours changing some stupid values in my bot and test it against its precedessor. That's work a script can do for me :)
2010-10-09T09:17:09  <oPless> yeah ... compile in monodevelop, type make ... then check run

2010-10-09T11:47:59  <Frontier> Let's do the math: We have 3000 players, they all have bots that play 200 rounds in each game and think about their turn for one second. So that would be 3000*200 seconds or 167 hours for one iteration of the player list :D

2010-10-09T11:51:25  <fluffluff1> ty
2010-10-09T11:51:38  <Frontier> Just guessing. Try to stay below ^^
2010-10-09T11:51:51  <Frontier> There is nothing official I think.
2010-10-09T11:52:04  <oPless> isn't javas default something like 64Mb ?
2010-10-09T11:52:14  <oPless> or am I old?
2010-10-09T11:52:17  <fluffluff1> oh... odd. I'd think many people could use a whole lot
2010-10-09T11:52:22  <jmcarthur> there was a limit on the sadbox, but i think it was removed when all the java entries started crashing
2010-10-09T11:52:26  <fluffluff1> opless: you're old :)
2010-10-09T11:52:32  <krokokrusa> depends on a machine

2010-10-09T11:53:55  <Frontier> jmcarthur: tell me more. Do you read out the memory limit and then attack the last planet with as many ships? ^^
2010-10-09T11:54:08  <jmcarthur> "read out the memory limit"?
2010-10-09T11:54:30  <Frontier> I think in Java you can query the VM memory limit.
2010-10-09T11:54:36  <jmcarthur> i'm not using java
2010-10-09T11:54:53  <Frontier> So what will your test code do?
2010-10-09T11:54:57  <jmcarthur> by test code i meant unit tests
2010-10-09T11:55:13  <jmcarthur> unrelated to what we were talking about
2010-10-09T11:55:36  <jmcarthur> was going to ask if anybody else is doing unit tests and what kinds of things they are testing if so
2010-10-09T11:55:39  <Frontier> Like what I said 3 hours ago?: Frontier	On another note I think about running automated test cases on my bot. I save a few game states in which my bot behaves odd, and when I think I fixed the issue I run it again against that game state and others I previously saved so I don't run into regressions.
2010-10-09T11:55:55  <jmcarthur> ah that won't work for my bot anyway
2010-10-09T11:56:10  <jmcarthur> it's nondeterministic and builds up state over the course of many turns
2010-10-09T11:56:44  <Frontier> oh.. i feel like my bot is very rudimentary now ^^
2010-10-09T11:57:49  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-10-09T11:57:53  <jmcarthur> but at least it's running :P
2010-10-09T11:58:11  <Frontier> What does this state account for? Couldn't you do without for a test case?
2010-10-09T11:58:45  <jmcarthur> i could test some specific functions, but i don't know how to test the nondeterministic behavior of my bot
2010-10-09T11:59:28  <Frontier> just.. make it deterministic. Put in some default state.
2010-10-09T11:59:43  <Frontier> Do as if it was the first round of the game.
2010-10-09T12:00:01  <jmcarthur> actually the first round i might make deterministic
2010-10-09T12:00:06  <jmcarthur> with special case code
2010-10-09T12:00:12  <contestbot> Top 10 players: felixcoto(3802), rsergio(3772), Hazard(3757), cfaftw(3700), ofrias(3699), sequoh(3648), davidjliu(3648), EBraun(3610), adumlah(3610), kcm1700(3603)
2010-10-09T12:00:33  <jmcarthur> but the other turns are nondeterministic even with a known initial state
2010-10-09T12:01:12  <krokokrusa> I think good idea is to start testing individual methods, regarding unit testing
2010-10-09T12:01:25  <krokokrusa> I mean, not testing for a specific response for a given game state
2010-10-09T12:01:26  <jmcarthur> i mean, there is a way i could make it deterministic (using a known seed, running my algorithm for a known number of iterations per turn, etc.)
2010-10-09T12:01:36  <Frontier> wtf? how does this work under the hood? you cannot know anything in the first round so why is there a chance it will behave differently
2010-10-09T12:01:39  <jmcarthur> krokokrusa: right, that's the kind of thing i was planning to do
2010-10-09T12:01:52  <jmcarthur> Frontier: what do you mean not know anything?
2010-10-09T12:03:19  <Frontier> jmcarthur: It doesn't know about the previous rounds, where its defense was weak, what the enemy is doing. You just put in some random numbers to make it non-deterministic and give others trouble to understand how to beat your bot ^^
2010-10-09T12:03:34  <jmcarthur> uh
2010-10-09T12:03:57  <jmcarthur> i think you are making some broad assumptions about where the nondeterminism from my bot is coming from
2010-10-09T12:04:22  <jmcarthur> ;)
2010-10-09T12:04:34  <jmcarthur> i'm not just "putting in some random numbers"
2010-10-09T12:04:49  <krokokrusa> it's possible to iteratively search for a solution for 1 second, and then execute the best move
2010-10-09T12:04:57  <jmcarthur> right
2010-10-09T12:05:04  <krokokrusa> then even on he 1st turn there is a place for some non-determinism
2010-10-09T12:05:08  <jmcarthur> that's essentially what i'm doing
2010-10-09T12:05:17  <jmcarthur> on top of that, the search is somewhat stochastic
2010-10-09T12:05:37  <Frontier> ok, that explains why the server is so slow now ^^
2010-10-09T12:05:45  <jmcarthur> i'm not even running on the server yet
2010-10-09T12:05:52  <krokokrusa> cool, I'm yet to implement the searching :)
2010-10-09T12:05:53  <jmcarthur> and no, that doesn't explain it
2010-10-09T12:08:18  <Titankiller> can i edit planetwars.java in the starter pack ?
2010-10-09T12:08:53  <Frontier> Well if the top 100 players always end in a draw and think about the best move for 1 second that means 20,000 CPU seconds for their games ;-) And that is about 5,6 hours divided by number of CPUs. But it happened to suddenly now, I don't believe myself that it is the problem, but it could become one.
2010-10-09T12:09:07  <krokokrusa> Titankiller: sure, why not
2010-10-09T12:09:25  <Frontier> Titankiller: and you can add more files
2010-10-09T12:09:30  <Titankiller> any external libraries ?
2010-10-09T12:09:58  <Frontier> hmm... try to stick with .java files and no directory structure.
2010-10-09T12:10:27  <jmcarthur> Frontier: that's a big "if"
2010-10-09T12:10:42  <jmcarthur> Frontier: the problem with the server is that there is only one server running games right now
2010-10-09T12:10:53  <jmcarthur> Frontier: we have been getting our speed by running the games on many servers
2010-10-09T12:11:01  <Janzert> it's pretty easily checkable that the reason games are being run slow is because none of the cloud servers are up
2010-10-09T12:11:19  <Frontier> How many are there usually running?

2010-10-09T12:11:32  <Janzert> 2-4 servers
2010-10-09T12:11:33  <jmcarthur> Frontier: it's variable, but it's usually around 3 i think
2010-10-09T12:11:47  <jmcarthur> Frontier: the one server running right now is much slower than the others
2010-10-09T12:18:48  <Bobng> As I said, I am willing to donate a VPS
2010-10-09T12:19:04  <Bobng> to help increase the computing power, but nobody seems to be around.

2010-10-09T12:23:54  <Janzert> Bobng: be aware unless you can give up all ability to access it (e.g. through the host OS) that will forfeit your ability to participate
2010-10-09T12:24:38  <Bobng> yes, I have been told that several times
2010-10-09T12:24:42  <Bobng> I don't participate anyway
2010-10-09T12:24:53  <Bobng> plus I won't have access.
2010-10-09T12:24:59  <Janzert> I have a feeling the reason for lack of servers running right now is a technical failure and lack of people to fix it not lack of resources

2010-10-09T15:05:24  <d3c1ph3r> Hey question? Whats the difference between your bot being player in the first position or second position for where it calls the jar, it wins under 2 position, it totally screws up at 1, since I've been debugging as 2 I didn't notice. What variables change? is it the owner id? why would second position be player 1
2010-10-09T15:07:20  <Zannick> the id you see is always 1, but your starting planet is not always id 1
2010-10-09T15:07:37  <Zannick> when you are "player 2" to the engine, your starting planet is id 2
2010-10-09T15:08:04  <d3c1ph3r> hmm
2010-10-09T15:08:06  <d3c1ph3r> could that be it
2010-10-09T15:08:21  <d3c1ph3r> i wouldn't imagine i would automatically assume starting position usually i traverse
2010-10-09T15:08:37  <Zannick> that's the only thing i can think of
2010-10-09T15:09:18  *** Cyndre <Cyndre!~Cyndre@DOCSIS-181-75.cable-lynx.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-09T15:10:28  <d3c1ph3r> also what other things could cause an illegal move, like sending more troops then ur planet has, sending less then zero? is there anything else that illegal besides attacking when enemyplanets == 0;
2010-10-09T15:11:48  <Naktibalda> attacking when enemyplanets == 0  isn't an illegal move
2010-10-09T15:12:02  <Zannick> sending more ships than you have, sending less than zero, sending ships from a planet to itself
2010-10-09T15:12:06  <Naktibalda> sending from planet you don't own is illegal
2010-10-09T15:12:25  <Zannick> sending to planets that don't exist
2010-10-09T15:13:18  <jmcarthur> also keep in mind that there is a subtle point about sending more ships from a planet than are currently there. because you can send more than one fleet in a turn, you have to consider the sum of all fleets leaving a planet, not just each one separately
2010-10-09T15:14:40  <Naktibalda> sending a fractional number of ships is illegal too
2010-10-09T15:14:49  <choas> a comma-separated value is also an illegal move
2010-10-09T15:14:55  <d3c1ph3r> perfect this is all really helpfull
2010-10-09T15:15:33  <d3c1ph3r> my program fails at me issuing my orders so i'm trying to debug it to see what would cause the illegal move
2010-10-09T15:15:52  <d3c1ph3r> right before i win it fails sometimes
2010-10-09T15:16:12  <Zannick> right before you win?
2010-10-09T15:16:21  <jmcarthur> yay i have some unit testing!
2010-10-09T15:16:32  <Zannick> perhaps you are attempting to do something with an enemy planet when they have none?
2010-10-09T15:16:35  <d3c1ph3r> yeah ill be attacking my last planet, and right before the ships get there boom game over my ships dissapear

2010-10-09T15:28:03  <jmcarthur> was testing my parsing code. my random map generator also generates comments just to make sure my parser handles it properly. it generates progressively larger data sets as it goes. since i set the number of cases to test to a million is was generating... very large comments. i hit swap and found myself unable to do anything for a bit there :\
2010-10-09T15:28:57  <jmcarthur> actually it's not the map generator, it's just the tester that adds the comments, but whatever

2010-10-09T19:25:24  <Blkt> is the growth rate range of values fixed from 1 to 5 or is it different?

2010-10-09T19:31:53  <jmcarthur> i think it's specified to not be below 0, but my memory could be wrong

2010-10-09T19:42:19  <Blkt> mmm, I doubt a planet with negative gf may be of any use, not matter the place
2010-10-09T19:42:35  <sigh> I agree
2010-10-09T19:42:50  <Blkt> 1 or 0 gf may still be of some use
2010-10-09T19:43:29  <janzert> the only use for negative growth planets that I see would be to catch unwary bots which seems completely unnecessary
2010-10-09T19:43:42  <sigh> janzert: yeah I agree
2010-10-09T19:45:19  <sigh> 0-growth can be useful as a staging planet
2010-10-09T19:45:30  <Zannick> 0-growth can exist
2010-10-09T19:45:39  <Zannick> only as the center planet, at the moment
2010-10-09T19:45:41  <sigh> yes, in center only atm
2010-10-09T19:45:43  <sigh> :P
2010-10-09T19:46:37  <Blkt> it depends, if you have a planet further from center that has 5 gf may be better, because it could let you attack earlier on turns instead of this

2010-10-09T19:52:22  <sigh> looks like that was right :P
2010-10-09T19:53:02  <Meatkat> Why wouldn't it matter at higher levels?
2010-10-09T19:53:28  <sigh> because the stronger bots don't take neutrals when the enemy could easily take them

2010-10-09T19:56:54  <Meatkat> Say you just concentrate on your side of the board for a moment. You can calculate the optimal order to take planets with the goal of minimizing the amount of turns it takes to take all the planets. Giving you some sort of order to take them. Now add the enemy back in the picture. Does the order have any relevance or use anymore?
2010-10-09T19:58:58  <sigh> yes I think so... it is obviously an approximation once the enemy enters the picture though

2010-10-09T19:59:22  <sigh> I think the most important thing to get out of that is the *paths* that your ships would take
2010-10-09T19:59:56  <Meatkat> What do you mean?
2010-10-09T20:00:07  <sigh> for example, if hopping from planet 1 to 4 to 5 is more efficient then sending units directly from 1 to 4 and 1 to 5
2010-10-09T20:00:16  <contestbot> Top 10 players: felixcoto(3812), rsergio(3795), Hazard(3766), ofrias(3737), cfaftw(3729), davidjliu(3695), EBraun(3672), sequoh(3662), dmj111(3656), adumlah(3649)
2010-10-09T20:00:47  <epona> what would happen if I won?
2010-10-09T20:00:48  <sigh> I don't think any bots handle that case well, because it requires a very annoying search
2010-10-09T20:01:40  <sigh> (I'm talking about capturing neutrals, rather than just hopping across planets to redistribute ships which many bots do)
2010-10-09T20:02:32  <sigh> but still... what I'm saying is a guess... I've had plenty of ideas that should work but didn't make much difference ;)
2010-10-09T20:02:36  <Meatkat> Hmmm... so you'd be talking about sending extra ships to cap planet 4, planning to cap planet 5 much sooner than if you had to resend from planet 1?
2010-10-09T20:03:18  <sigh> yeah, for example if planets are in a cluster, it might be best to send units to one planet in the cluster and have the growth from that planet capture the rest
2010-10-09T20:03:48  <sigh> leaving ships free to take over other planets
2010-10-09T20:04:57  <sigh> most people at the moment are thinking about attacking only from *current planets* and getting an optimal solution for that is tricky enough, although the knapsak problem helps
2010-10-09T20:05:04  <Meatkat> So by saying it's 'more efficient' you're talking about minimizing flight times?
2010-10-09T20:06:20  <sigh> I suppose, minimising the time to get the highest growth rate... or something similar to that
2010-10-09T20:06:42  <sigh> figuring out what you should be optimising over is also hard :)
2010-10-09T20:07:02  <Meatkat> indeed
2010-10-09T20:08:34  <sigh> for example, in this post http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=854 mcmillen talks about using the knapsack problem to determine the best way to send out ships on the first turn to maximise growth rate

2010-10-09T20:11:45  <sigh> that's not too bad, a lot of people around your level have been in the top 10 at some point
2010-10-09T20:12:07  <sigh> the level of the bots is just improving quickly
2010-10-09T20:12:35  <Meatkat> Indeed, I wonder if that'll slow down at all...
2010-10-09T20:12:39  <Naktibalda> my bot is stable in range 70-80 for a week
2010-10-09T20:13:06  <Naktibalda> maybe even more
2010-10-09T20:13:22  <sigh> hard to say, it still seems like all the improvements are incremental, no big upsets yet
2010-10-09T20:13:39  <sigh> and I think that will happen eventually, so still on the lookup for that
2010-10-09T20:13:46  <Naktibalda> not many people can develop their bots for months
2010-10-09T20:13:55  <Naktibalda> many gave up
2010-10-09T20:14:35  * Naktibalda did a 9 day break :)
2010-10-09T20:14:56  <sigh> sometimes breaks are a good thing

2010-10-09T22:41:29  <agweber> Soooooooo I need java help.
2010-10-09T22:42:27  <agweber> http://pastebin.com/qCp4cBTj   This section of code causes my bot to not even try. I can comment it out and everything else works as normal.
2010-10-09T22:42:52  <agweber> There are no code errors, so it must be a logical fault
2010-10-09T22:43:22  <agweber> Last time I did this one guy pointed out about 5 things that I completely failed at, and I think I fixed all of those.
2010-10-09T22:46:17  <agweber> Okay, so apparently && != &,.. I changed the & to a && but that didn't change anything.
2010-10-09T22:50:29  <sigh> what do you mean when you say your bot doesn't work?
2010-10-09T22:50:43  <sigh> does it timeout, issue illegal moves, just play badly?
2010-10-09T22:52:16  <agweber> Well, using the playgame thing, it just goes Turn 1; Player 2 Wins
2010-10-09T22:52:51  <sigh> ok, sounds like an illegal move or a timeout
2010-10-09T22:53:11  <sigh> hmmm.. you don't seem to check if your source planet has enough ships when issuing an order
2010-10-09T22:53:12  <agweber> I've tried 80 different ways to make sure that while loop wasn't infinite
2010-10-09T22:53:19  <agweber> I did
2010-10-09T22:53:27  <agweber> line 33
2010-10-09T22:54:03  <sigh> that's not enough, you need to make sure that mine.NumShips() <= p.NumShips() + 1
2010-10-09T22:54:13  <sigh> since that is how many ships you are sending
2010-10-09T22:54:28  <agweber> Ahhh
2010-10-09T22:55:30  <agweber> Tried that, still isn't working. Tried +2 as well
2010-10-09T22:56:39  <janzert> after sending your first fleet, the number of ships left on the planet is out of date

2010-10-09T22:56:41  <agweber> But good catch!
2010-10-09T22:56:53  <janzert> at least if you are using the stock framework
2010-10-09T22:56:59  <agweber> It doesn't update? So I need to keep track manually
2010-10-09T22:57:06  <agweber> Yeah, stock framework

2010-10-09T22:57:54  <sigh> you can keep track manually, or you can update the framework so it keeps track for you
2010-10-09T22:58:22  <sigh> either way, I would suggest looking at a log of the exact orders that your bot is sending
2010-10-09T22:58:33  <sigh> log.txt should show you that
2010-10-09T22:59:04  <agweber> In the base folder?
2010-10-09T22:59:09  <agweber> says initializing
2010-10-09T22:59:20  <agweber> and that's it
2010-10-09T22:59:56  <sigh> ah :(

2010-10-09T23:00:33  <agweber> Lemme relook over my manually track thing again
2010-10-09T23:01:33  <sigh> just use the RemoveShips() function.... mine.RemoveShips(p.NumShips()+1)
2010-10-09T23:02:08  <sigh> that should work for now :)
2010-10-09T23:03:31  <agweber> Hot shit, that was it
2010-10-09T23:03:40  <agweber> I would've never figured out that it wasn't updating.
