2010-11-19T02:43:00  <janzert> what's that?
2010-11-19T02:43:14  <McLeopold> a change to the switch active function
2010-11-19T02:43:31  <McLeopold> it uses the z-order as well
2010-11-19T02:43:38  <janzert> it's in there

2010-11-19T02:55:32  <lavalamp_> hmm why?
2010-11-19T02:55:53  <antimatroid> nah, there's a planet off teh screen
2010-11-19T02:55:59  <antimatroid> it's using the old visualisetr
2010-11-19T02:56:26  <McLeopold> nvm, I was trying to analyze why you attack the back line or front line first
2010-11-19T02:56:56  <lavalamp_> ah that's 'cause I'm retarded
2010-11-19T02:57:09  <antimatroid> is it just me or are there new names in the top 10

2010-11-19T03:02:45  <antimatroid> damn i wish lots more maps were added early on
2010-11-19T03:03:23  <lavalamp_> maybe we can get them to run a crazy map competition in january ^^
2010-11-19T03:03:24  <McLeopold> map types or # of maps
2010-11-19T03:04:00  <lavalamp_> map types
2010-11-19T03:04:05  <McLeopold> I think I need to lower the starting ship counts
2010-11-19T03:05:00  <lavalamp_> what's the ip/ port for your crazy map server? I wanna start a bot
2010-11-19T03:05:05  <McLeopold> http://tcp2.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=17
2010-11-19T03:05:06  <McLeopold> 996
2010-11-19T03:05:12  <antimatroid> i'd be willing to put a little bit of effort in to try and get it to work half decently wth n>2 players
2010-11-19T03:05:14  <McLeopold> ^^ that map is a giant fail
2010-11-19T03:05:29  <McLeopold> abandon all planets and go for the growth 5
2010-11-19T03:05:51  <McLeopold> yeah, but you need a whole new game engine for that
2010-11-19T03:06:00  <McLeopold> I was thinking about moving planets
2010-11-19T03:06:10  <McLeopold> How would you calc turn remaining?
2010-11-19T03:06:26  <antimatroid> distance changes every turn, would be messy but doable
2010-11-19T03:06:29  <Accoun> yes!!! http://72.44.46.68/ in new map set!
2010-11-19T03:06:33  <antimatroid> and i don't know if it's be overly fair
2010-11-19T03:06:52  <McLeopold> Accoun: and new visualizer
2010-11-19T03:07:08  <McLeopold> I'm surprised dhartmei used my messy planet id and growth
2010-11-19T03:07:19  <McLeopold> It really looks ugly :)
2010-11-19T03:07:25  <lavalamp_> my bots would fail with moving planets
2010-11-19T03:07:31  <antimatroid> my bot would too
2010-11-19T03:07:39  <antimatroid> i ignore coordinates after the first move
2010-11-19T03:07:40  <McLeopold> yeah, I don't even know how I would calculate for that
2010-11-19T03:07:43  <lavalamp_> I precalc a bunch of tables
2010-11-19T03:07:44  <antimatroid> but wouldn't take me long to fix
2010-11-19T03:07:56  <McLeopold> you'd have to be given a schedule of the movements or something
2010-11-19T03:08:04  <lavalamp_> yeah exactly
2010-11-19T03:08:24  <lavalamp_> otherwise you couldn't predict
2010-11-19T03:08:37  <antimatroid> yeah, you'd want to give them equations of ellipsoids on the map
2010-11-19T03:08:46  <antimatroid> then planets on each ellipsoid and starting positions
2010-11-19T03:09:09  <McLeopold> I think n players is better to work on first
2010-11-19T03:09:09  <antimatroid> well, i think soid is 3d ? i'm terrible with names
2010-11-19T03:09:29  <McLeopold> oh, and 3d maps
2010-11-19T03:09:34  <McLeopold> with a cool visualizer :)
2010-11-19T03:09:48  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-11-19T03:10:59  <lavalamp_> 3d maps wouldn't change a thing for me
2010-11-19T03:11:32  <lavalamp_> my bot is soley dependant on planet distances
2010-11-19T03:11:35  <McLeopold> well, it might
2010-11-19T03:11:43  <antimatroid> i'd have to change to handle 3 coordinates, but neither
2010-11-19T03:11:46  <antimatroid> and the game changes
2010-11-19T03:11:51  <McLeopold> there would be a lot more planets at the same distance all at once
2010-11-19T03:11:56  <antimatroid> ^^
2010-11-19T03:12:12  <McLeopold> So, there would be alot more r/p/s situations
2010-11-19T03:12:14  <lavalamp_> yeah but that doesn't change the math
2010-11-19T03:12:23  <McLeopold> no, not the math, but I think the stragegy
2010-11-19T03:12:26  <antimatroid> that's why i wanted to do 3d tron :(
2010-11-19T03:12:38  <McLeopold> 3d tron would be cool
2010-11-19T03:12:45  <antimatroid> super cool, hard to watch
2010-11-19T03:12:51  <lavalamp_> oo yeah
2010-11-19T03:12:52  <McLeopold> 3d dots and boxes?
2010-11-19T03:12:58  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-11-19T03:13:01  <McLeopold> dots and cubes?
2010-11-19T03:13:15  <McLeopold> dots and boxes AND cubes?
2010-11-19T03:13:20  <antimatroid> oh god
2010-11-19T03:13:24  <lavalamp_> and hypercubes
2010-11-19T03:13:31  <antimatroid> not quite sure how you'd score that
2010-11-19T03:13:34  <McLeopold> dang, you beat me to that ;)
2010-11-19T03:13:36  <lavalamp_> heh make a visualizer for that!
2010-11-19T03:13:52  <McLeopold> box = 1, cube = 5
2010-11-19T03:14:13  <lavalamp_> a cube is 6 boxes
2010-11-19T03:14:19  <antimatroid> not always
2010-11-19T03:14:24  <antimatroid> lots overlop
2010-11-19T03:14:26  <antimatroid> overlap*
2010-11-19T03:14:34  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-11-19T03:14:37  <antimatroid> well it is, but not all of the sides are unique to that cube
2010-11-19T03:15:05  <McLeopold> although, I would prefer a game with simultaneous moves
2010-11-19T03:15:11  <antimatroid> yeah, same
2010-11-19T03:15:18  <McLeopold> like diplomacy, no press
2010-11-19T03:15:36  <antimatroid> i like the idea of a 2d shooter game of sorts

2010-11-19T04:40:38  <antimatroid1> someone posted in the forums looking for another run with crazier maps and n>2 players
2010-11-19T04:41:50  <lavalamp_> my code could do it without too much work
2010-11-19T04:42:01  <lavalamp_> maybe not in one second though
2010-11-19T04:43:40  <antimatroid1> the biggest thing with adding more players would be taking out people that try to wait
2010-11-19T04:43:57  <antimatroid1> i expect you need to agree with the other player and send small amounts together each turn
2010-11-19T04:44:19  <antimatroid1> i don't think it would be too hard to signal that if lots of bots were doing it
2010-11-19T04:46:45  <lavalamp_> sigh.... my new code isn't magic
2010-11-19T04:46:49  <lavalamp_> ok sleep time

2010-11-19T08:32:46  <antimatroid1> the top 10 has been a lot more competitive today
2010-11-19T08:32:49  <antimatroid1> that could just be it
2010-11-19T08:33:17  <antimatroid1> oh man, another new person in the top 10
2010-11-19T08:33:23  <antimatroid1> although they haven't had many games
2010-11-19T08:33:28  <Error323_> it means nothing
2010-11-19T08:33:29  <antimatroid1> a PHP bot too

2010-11-19T08:34:56  <rabidus> php isn't that bad..
2010-11-19T08:35:06  <antimatroid1> never used it :P
2010-11-19T08:35:11  <rabidus> tried few functions.. c++ vectors vs php arrays
2010-11-19T08:35:33  <rabidus> php was just 60% slower, which is kinda much. but i was thinking something like 60000%
2010-11-19T08:35:46  <antimatroid1> c++ <3
2010-11-19T08:37:54  <antimatroid1> gah wtf
2010-11-19T08:38:11  <antimatroid1> i'm getting layers in my tree where it's not the player i would expect with repeating players turns
2010-11-19T08:38:46  <Error323_> php is ment for very other things then writing an ai bot :P

2010-11-19T08:47:34  <aerique> antimatroid1: definitely shouldn't be too often otherwise I'd get nothing else done
2010-11-19T08:47:56  <antimatroid1> tron was only for 3 weeks
2010-11-19T08:48:02  <antimatroid1> but this definitely needed 3 months
2010-11-19T08:48:05  <aerique> antimatroid1: either once a year for three months or twice but for a shorter period
2010-11-19T08:48:20  <aerique> 3 weeks was a little short
2010-11-19T08:48:27  <antimatroid1> not for tron

2010-11-19T09:33:04  <antimatroid1> he almost came back on you
2010-11-19T09:33:15  <d0ugal> Yeah, but not really
2010-11-19T09:33:39  <antimatroid1> he probably only lost cause he tried to expand stupidly
2010-11-19T09:33:52  <antimatroid1> actually, he was pretty far behind then anyway

2010-11-19T10:48:36  <antimatroid1> mega1: i suspect it's from all the new names
2010-11-19T10:48:46  <antimatroid1> you guys in the top 10 seem to be beating each other about
2010-11-19T10:49:02  <antimatroid1> although you still seem to be holding them at bay
2010-11-19T10:49:23  <antimatroid1> i've decided raschi is way worse than bix0r at resubmitting, he has 111 pages of submissions
2010-11-19T10:49:38  <mega1> heh
2010-11-19T10:50:03  <antimatroid1> he started with c# then went to java :\
2010-11-19T10:50:35  <mega1> I don't think I'm holding them at bay, I just have a longer history of games with a lot of wins until yesterday
2010-11-19T10:51:26  <antimatroid1> they all get lots of losses too
2010-11-19T10:51:41  <mega1> but that's all they have
2010-11-19T10:51:41  <antimatroid1> i think you're just used to almost always winning :P
2010-11-19T10:51:52  <mega1> I'm tempted to upload a new version
2010-11-19T10:52:07  <antimatroid1> possibly worth seeing how it does
2010-11-19T10:52:20  <antimatroid1> while it'd be nice for you to be sitting up top now, it's the final result that counts most

2010-11-19T10:55:54  <antimatroid1> hehe
2010-11-19T10:56:57  <mega1> it's incredible how a "better" bot can have worse results on tcp
2010-11-19T10:57:17  <antimatroid1> depends whose playing when you run it i guess
2010-11-19T10:57:22  <antimatroid1> who's**
2010-11-19T10:57:52  <antimatroid1> there often does only seem to be a few people running at a time
2010-11-19T10:58:35  <antimatroid1> the top 10 is going to be very competitive this time

2010-11-19T11:00:21  <medrimonia> I started rewriting mine last Saturday
2010-11-19T11:01:10  <medrimonia> And I was beginning to think "that's so stupid, I can't be ranked in the top 100 with the new"
2010-11-19T11:01:26  <medrimonia> And now... it seems to be better than the old one

2010-11-19T11:02:02  <antimatroid1> but somewhere in the top 50 would be nice
2010-11-19T11:02:12  <antimatroid1> preferably at the better end

2010-11-19T11:10:35  <antimatroid1> i've taken my time with this final revision
2010-11-19T11:11:21  <medrimonia> I've still got an old version of my attack part, my bot just looks like some patchwork
2010-11-19T11:12:39  <medrimonia> Wasn't Hazard #1 before?
2010-11-19T11:13:10  <antimatroid1> maybe at some point
2010-11-19T11:13:18  <antimatroid1> mega1 has been on top for a good month or two
2010-11-19T11:13:31  <mega1> one
2010-11-19T11:13:51  <antimatroid1> just one?
2010-11-19T11:13:56  <antimatroid1> seems like longer
2010-11-19T11:14:08  <medrimonia> No I thinks it's right
2010-11-19T11:14:11  <antimatroid1> that's still a really long time to hold first though
2010-11-19T11:14:44  <medrimonia> it wasn't before the twentieth october
2010-11-19T11:14:52  <antimatroid1> there's 1 point difference in elo up there atm
2010-11-19T11:14:52  <medrimonia> Oct 20th 15:25:53  successfully entered into contest               Lisp
2010-11-19T11:15:15  <antimatroid1> first submission was the 10th
2010-11-19T11:15:22  <antimatroid1> no, sep 19th
2010-11-19T11:15:46  <medrimonia> Yes but at the beginning you weren't even in the top 100 right mega1?

2010-11-19T11:36:21  <mega1> I find it really curious how losses started to pile up suddenly.
2010-11-19T11:36:44  <mega1> Can it be that the servers are running more at the same time?
2010-11-19T11:36:57  <mega1> janzert: any changes on the servers?
2010-11-19T11:38:25  <rebelxt> mega1: did it start happening after the latest map change or when the servers slowed down last night? i had a very weird losing streak too
2010-11-19T11:39:01  <mega1> it's hard to tell: http://ai-contest.com/profile_games.php?user_id=8565
2010-11-19T11:39:14  <mega1> first loss is: Nov 18th 21:16:48
2010-11-19T11:39:34  <antimatroid1> from my observations, you've had a few streaks of loses since the new maps came on
2010-11-19T11:39:46  <antimatroid1> but i still think it's performed better than other bots
2010-11-19T11:40:59  <rebelxt> Nov 18th 9pm - that's when I noticed servers slowed down a lot (GPM dropped by 50%). but we are now back to normal 170 GPM: http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-11-19T11:41:34  <antimatroid1> 170 is above normal isn't it?
2010-11-19T11:41:59  <rebelxt> GPM has been 150-160 recently with 4 servers running
2010-11-19T11:42:37  <antimatroid1> less than 3900 bots online atm
2010-11-19T11:42:54  <antimatroid1> wait no, it just doesn't show the last page of numbers anymore :|
2010-11-19T11:43:04  <antimatroid1> what, it does now :\
2010-11-19T11:43:05  <antimatroid1> weird
2010-11-19T11:43:15  <antimatroid1> almost 4400 bots
2010-11-19T11:44:22  <rebelxt> mega1, i can't tell if it's related to your losses but i saw both myself and bhasker resubmit last night at the same time and we both dropped from ~30-40 to 100+... slowly climbing back up now.. however my submission is heuristic so time-outs are most certainly not an issue
2010-11-19T11:44:31  <rebelxt> mega1, smth is going on - you normally don
2010-11-19T11:44:42  <rebelxt> don't lose games to 150+ ranked bots
2010-11-19T11:45:49  <mega1> in light of the sudden drop in ratings there may indeed be a problem here

2010-11-19T11:50:17  <rebelxt> for me a sudden losing streak might have been related to map change. my funneling logic seems to make wrong decisions for many new maps. more testing needed
2010-11-19T11:51:34  <rebelxt> oh yeah, ratings might be messed up during the last week with many people submitting strong bots they've been working on on tcp for weeks...
2010-11-19T11:52:06  <antimatroid1> and off tcp
2010-11-19T11:52:27  <antimatroid1> medrimonia: up into top 20
2010-11-19T11:52:39  <antimatroid1> top 10*
2010-11-19T11:52:46  <antimatroid1> only off two games though :P
2010-11-19T11:52:53  <rebelxt> off tcp - maybe.. but one gotta be very smart to make good improvements using local testing only..
2010-11-19T11:53:56  <medrimonia> Yes I've seen, I was ten with one game
2010-11-19T11:53:58  <antimatroid1> quite a few of the top people i haven't seen on tcp at all
2010-11-19T11:54:46  <antimatroid1> they could be going under other names of course
2010-11-19T11:54:52  <antimatroid1> i still have no idea who testingFromPiter is
2010-11-19T11:55:04  <medrimonia> I've got to wait to see what it look's like after more that 24 hours
2010-11-19T11:55:05  <rebelxt> it seems all names in current top 12-14 have been testing on tcp
2010-11-19T11:55:29  <medrimonia> XD 5 with two games
2010-11-19T11:55:33  <rebelxt> medrimonia: yeah it should stabilize in 24-48h
2010-11-19T11:56:29  <rebelxt> don't start celebrating just yet - this has happened to me before as well ;-) feels good though hehe
2010-11-19T11:56:49  <JamesMG> McLeopold: it might be good to paginate the username games page on your TCP server
2010-11-19T11:57:04  <JamesMG> it's starting to take some time for mine to load and I can't imagine it's being nice to your bandwidth :)
2010-11-19T11:57:36  <McLeopold> Hmm.. okay, I might just expire a bunch of game too
2010-11-19T11:58:17  <antimatroid1> ?
2010-11-19T11:58:18  <McLeopold> Pagination would require I write a really website instead of static html.  That's a big switch.
2010-11-19T11:58:55  <JamesMG> ah.  I can just rename myself instead
2010-11-19T11:59:18  <McLeopold> If you don't mind.  That's a good hack.
2010-11-19T11:59:18  <JamesMG> probably overkill to have 2000+ games of history across tweaks anyways

2010-11-19T12:18:08  <McLeopold> going for that extra 19 was stupid

2010-11-19T12:28:07  <antimatroid1> looks a lot like a draw map to me
2010-11-19T12:28:13  <mega1> McLeopold: do you have a game that shows why it may not be a draw?
2010-11-19T12:28:32  <McLeopold> not yet, I'm just calculating in my head, but the game should be similar to the other one
2010-11-19T12:28:34  <antimatroid1> i can't see anything worth doing other than waiting
2010-11-19T12:28:41  <McLeopold> where I was able to hold the 17 planet.
2010-11-19T12:28:46  <McLeopold> I think the 25 is the key

2010-11-19T12:31:33  <antimatroid1> nah way, there's 1 distance difference
2010-11-19T12:31:39  <McLeopold> If it's not a draw, then you should have done a first move
2010-11-19T12:32:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: so draw or not?
2010-11-19T12:32:21  <antimatroid1> hmm, i'm not sure
2010-11-19T12:32:34  <antimatroid1> i think it's actually quite tricky now
2010-11-19T12:32:53  <antimatroid1> say you are red in the above linked game, on the second turn, blue has to decide what to sent at your expansion
2010-11-19T12:33:03  <antimatroid1> but if they send everything, you can respond the following turn by taking them out
2010-11-19T12:33:09  <antimatroid1> you can also wait to defend anything the do send
2010-11-19T12:33:36  <McLeopold> I need the distance to the 10 neutral
2010-11-19T12:33:37  <lavalamp_> that doesn't look like a draw map to me
2010-11-19T12:34:00  <antimatroid1> mega1: thoughts on what i just said?
2010-11-19T12:34:02  <McLeopold> If going for the 25 means you give up the 10, then it's a draw, because the best move is to wait
2010-11-19T12:34:29  <antimatroid1> i need human mode with exact ship numbers :(
2010-11-19T12:34:40  <mega1> antimatroid1: that might be so
2010-11-19T12:35:01  <mega1> I need more time to analyze it
2010-11-19T12:35:28  <antimatroid1> i think it would be hard to get the 10 if they expanded, but i could be wrong

2010-11-19T13:02:29  <McLeopold> If it works, it invalidates 1000's of lines of code.

2010-11-19T13:13:58  <mega1> my nash bot also just sits there on the that map
2010-11-19T13:13:59  <antimatroid1> ahaha
2010-11-19T13:14:19  <antimatroid1> i'm going to try human mode on it
2010-11-19T13:14:25  <mega1> not that it's a particularly good bot
2010-11-19T13:14:37  <McLeopold> lisp, javascript or python: anyone else and I'll start handing out secrets :)

2010-11-19T13:16:04  <mega1> McLeopold seems to have a good taste
2010-11-19T13:16:25  <McLeopold> didn't the go founder say he wouldn't have done it if he had known about something else?
2010-11-19T13:16:59  <McLeopold> or do I have that backwards?

2010-11-19T13:18:36  <JamesMG> ugh, my bot is so broken right now I can't stand to run it
2010-11-19T13:18:38  <McLeopold> Clojure and Jython are in too. :)
2010-11-19T13:19:08  <McLeopold> Maybe haskell, but I still don't get it.
2010-11-19T13:19:16  <JamesMG> I'm gonna write a bash bot
2010-11-19T13:19:22  <JamesMG> just to make the ugliest thing possible
2010-11-19T13:19:57  <janzert> btw, I've started a final tournament transition checklist. Information on it at http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=1131

2010-11-19T13:22:19  <antimatroid1> janzert: with the way it's keeping old peoples ranking with new submissions
2010-11-19T13:22:23  <antimatroid1> will it clear that properly?
2010-11-19T13:22:56  <janzert> yes, that is handled by the step to run the ranking code twice after archiving all current games
2010-11-19T13:23:05  <antimatroid1> :) just making sure
2010-11-19T13:23:12  <janzert> yep :)
2010-11-19T13:23:33  <antimatroid1> i do think it's important that the leaderboard stays live
2010-11-19T13:24:12  <antimatroid1> you'll give accoun one less thing to call cheating on too
2010-11-19T13:24:16  <janzert> yeah, that's my current plan although I haven't discussed any of it with Jeff yet
2010-11-19T13:24:44  <janzert> hehe, not really too worried about that since I'm sure he'll find something
2010-11-19T13:25:44  <antimatroid1> i think i'd probably be in favour of keeping any draw maps too, as i don't think any will be as bad as some found with tron
2010-11-19T13:26:33  <antimatroid1> and players can't then just assume they wont be given a map on which they need to do nothing
2010-11-19T13:26:42  <janzert> yeah, given that the current generator seems to have a low probability of generating a trivial draw now it will probably be fine
2010-11-19T13:27:13  <Mjothvitnir> removing maps (after start) changes # of games played, (cheaters) replaying those opponents on new map looks bad also (cheaters kept replaying games till their favorite won)
2010-11-19T13:27:47  <Mjothvitnir> :)
2010-11-19T13:28:03  <antimatroid1> oh, one mor thing, it would be good to finalise how the tournament is to be run
2010-11-19T13:28:13  <antimatroid1> like what top x bots will get a round robin at the end
2010-11-19T13:28:17  <janzert> nah, at least now removing means just no new games will be played on it
2010-11-19T13:28:25  <janzert> the old games will still count
2010-11-19T13:28:41  <janzert> antimatroid1: I'm hoping for none
2010-11-19T13:29:03  <janzert> but it depends on how good we can make the rankings while running the full tournament
2010-11-19T13:29:04  <Mjothvitnir> see, that is what it takes, remove the "complaint" before it happens
2010-11-19T13:30:08  <McLeopold> janzert: the quickest way to find draw maps seems to be looking for 200 turns with no moves
2010-11-19T13:30:11  <janzert> i.e. my hope is that we can get good rankings top to bottom without resorting to eliminating bottom ranks
2010-11-19T13:30:41  <McLeopold> if the number look obviously bad, then it is probably a draw.
2010-11-19T13:30:53  <antimatroid1> i'm still not sure about removing them for this
2010-11-19T13:30:54  <McLeopold> If you have to think about it or calculate, it should probably stay in
2010-11-19T13:30:58  <Mjothvitnir> will non-starters be removed or will they kep playing?
2010-11-19T13:31:55  <janzert> McLeopold: the way I'm going to monitor it is just by watching percentage of draws among top players, but if there are only one or two I'll probably just leave it alone anyway
2010-11-19T13:32:09  <McLeopold> yes, that will work
2010-11-19T13:32:10  <Mjothvitnir> you could fire a _couple_ of simple maps at all bots and those that don't answer "go" don't play
2010-11-19T13:32:27  <McLeopold> but by "watching" you should target 200 turns with no moves first
2010-11-19T13:33:27  <janzert> Mjothvitnir: I'd rather not eliminate anyone that we allowed in during this phase
2010-11-19T13:33:52  <janzert> and bots that crash on the first turn have really quick games anyway
2010-11-19T13:33:56  <McLeopold> if they don't respond with a go, the won't take up too much cpu
2010-11-19T13:34:01  <mega1> janzert: has anything been changed on the servers in the last 24 hours?
2010-11-19T13:34:17  <janzert> you mean the change in elo range?
2010-11-19T13:34:18  <janzert> yes
2010-11-19T13:34:19  <McLeopold> but, you may want to consider a bot having played recently only if there was more than 1 turn
2010-11-19T13:34:51  <mega1> janzert: I'm suddenly losing way more and wondering if it's the opponent or something else too
2010-11-19T13:34:59  <Mjothvitnir> true, for the final, but I think that that should have been a test along with "compile failure" all along.
2010-11-19T13:35:10  <janzert> mega1: nothing that should effect that no
2010-11-19T13:35:34  <mega1> no more games played at the same time for instance?
2010-11-19T13:35:38  <janzert> nope
2010-11-19T13:35:44  <mega1> hmm
2010-11-19T13:35:50  <Mjothvitnir> the server games in last 24 hours would be much more meaning full :)

2010-11-19T13:36:48  <janzert> Mjothvitnir: yeah, eliminating immediate crash bots before entering them into the competition is something that should definitely be there for the next one
2010-11-19T13:37:38  <McLeopold> mega1: are the loses on line symmetry?
2010-11-19T13:37:41  <Zannick> i actually saw some code to handle that in one of the php submit files
2010-11-19T13:37:47  <Zannick> left over from an old contest
2010-11-19T13:38:12  <mega1> McLeopold: the line symmetric maps have been there for quite some time
2010-11-19T13:38:25  <Zannick> but yeah, we don't have tests and we should have had them
2010-11-19T13:38:27  <mega1> so they should not be a bigger problem suddenly
2010-11-19T13:38:33  <McLeopold> hmm
2010-11-19T13:38:43  <antimatroid1> i think he competition just got a lot better
2010-11-19T13:38:51  <janzert> in the last day I've added some additional restrictions on how a map is chosen, tweaked the visualizer, eliminated a database join when handing out matches to workers and started the final tournament checklist
2010-11-19T13:39:04  <janzert> so nothing that should be able to effect game outcomes
2010-11-19T13:39:17  <Zannick> besides the new maps
2010-11-19T13:39:19  <mega1> janzert: what are the restrictions on the map selection?
2010-11-19T13:39:32  <mega1> Zannick: new maps in the last 24 hours?
2010-11-19T13:40:00  <antimatroid1> mega1: you beat bix0r's new entry at least :)
2010-11-19T13:40:25  <Zannick> mega1: hm, no
2010-11-19T13:41:40  <janzert> mega1: the map must be enabled in the database and highest priority that the current pairing hasn't played and from that set one that minimizes the combined count of plays by each player
2010-11-19T13:42:22  <janzert> the part added in the past day was minimizing the plays by each player
2010-11-19T13:43:08  <mega1> do enabled maps have different priorities?
2010-11-19T13:43:15  <janzert> they can yes
2010-11-19T13:43:28  <mega1> why? when? how?
2010-11-19T13:43:49  <janzert> currently the last batch of maps is at priority 1 and the ones before that at the 2nd priority
2010-11-19T13:44:17  <janzert> of course there almost certainly won't be enough games played that the 2nd priority maps will get used at all
2010-11-19T13:44:39  <janzert> I just didn't completely disable them after adding the most recent maps is all

2010-11-19T13:48:02  <janzert> yeah, the r528 maps
2010-11-19T13:49:00  <McLeopold> janzert: that's a good map choosing method, I like it
2010-11-19T13:49:10  <janzert> but if I'm thinking about it right it would take over a month of games at the current rate before they would be used
2010-11-19T13:49:42  <janzert> maybe a little less
2010-11-19T13:49:58  <janzert> nah, maybe more :)
2010-11-19T13:50:14  <McLeopold> basically, a pairing must play all priority 1 maps before they can do 2
2010-11-19T13:50:20  <janzert> yep
2010-11-19T13:50:39  <McLeopold> what happens when the have played all maps?
2010-11-19T13:51:05  <janzert> it will repeat and start spitting out warnings in the log
2010-11-19T13:51:08  <Zannick> the tournament ends and we declare a winner?
2010-11-19T13:52:47  <McLeopold> so, instead of hasn't play, it's played the least?

2010-11-19T14:29:19  <mega1> these games are short
2010-11-19T14:29:44  <McLeopold> yeah, they start more developed

2010-11-19T14:30:04  <bhasker> my bot screwed up bigtime

2010-11-19T14:41:13  <JamesMG> ok McLeopold
2010-11-19T14:41:32  <bhasker> interesting close match i think
2010-11-19T14:41:37  <JamesMG> the draw?
2010-11-19T14:41:40  <bhasker> almost even
2010-11-19T14:41:48  <bhasker> no no the match my bot is having against antbot
2010-11-19T14:41:51  <JamesMG> oh ok
2010-11-19T14:42:49  <medrimonia> hmmm my new bot seems to be quite better than the old one
2010-11-19T14:43:42  <medrimonia> But I haven't enough games to know really how much it's gonna be ranked.
2010-11-19T14:43:45  <antimatroid1> it still loses even when it doesn't need to expand aha, bah i'll look at it when i get up
2010-11-19T14:43:47  <bhasker> aww lost it
2010-11-19T14:43:47  <bhasker> :(

2010-11-19T14:49:00  <bhasker> will there be planets with growth >5?
2010-11-19T14:49:33  <McLeopold> If I update the visualizer, yes

2010-11-19T14:51:46  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-19T14:52:00  <lavalamp_> to test it I made maps that started players off with 1000 ships and the planets had growth rates up to 100 I think
2010-11-19T14:52:07  <rebelxt> was it 0.23 you submitted?
2010-11-19T14:52:17  <bhasker> pretty much with one bug fixed
2010-11-19T14:52:25  <bhasker> my bot is too conservative
2010-11-19T14:52:40  <McLeopold> lavalamp_: check out my map generator, you can do that with command line options
2010-11-19T14:52:41  <rebelxt> cool, it should do well
2010-11-19T14:52:44  <bhasker> i am considering removing the concept of available ships altogether
2010-11-19T14:52:54  <antimatroid1> hmm, it tries to take enemies the same time it takes a neutral too
2010-11-19T14:52:56  <bhasker> and just launch as long as it improves my position
2010-11-19T14:53:17  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: cool
2010-11-19T14:53:20  <rebelxt> bhasker: don't think you can remove it completely.. but interesting idea..
2010-11-19T14:53:38  <bhasker> except i need an evaluation function thats very accurate
2010-11-19T14:53:49  <bhasker> my current one sucks:-\

2010-11-19T14:54:19  <rebelxt> bhasker: my most reckless bot does best too.. if i take scheduled fleets into account when calculating available ships, i don't do well heh
2010-11-19T14:54:28  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-19T14:54:30  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-19T14:55:22  <bhasker> let me try a modification
2010-11-19T14:55:34  <antimatroid1> bhasker: i haven't got the code running for that atm, take a look at some of the games
2010-11-19T14:55:43  <antimatroid1> it repeatedly sends out ships when it shouldn't
2010-11-19T14:55:51  <antimatroid1> it's also sending fleets all the way across the map
2010-11-19T14:56:01  <bhasker> my bot?
2010-11-19T14:56:02  <bhasker> or yours?

2010-11-19T15:04:18  <rebelxt> i'd be interested to get my Monte Carlo bot to completion.. it might do reasonably well given longer turn time and semi-heavy playouts
2010-11-19T15:05:16  <lavalamp_> my move generator uses monte carlo
2010-11-19T15:06:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: you're really falling down on these crazy_fast maps
2010-11-19T15:06:18  <McLeopold> http://tcp2.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=715
2010-11-19T15:06:38  <rebelxt> lavalamp_: but then you are using heuristic eval function to calculate value of each move, correct?
2010-11-19T15:07:00  <lavalamp_> correct
2010-11-19T15:07:14  <lavalamp_> well, value of each "playout"
2010-11-19T15:07:28  <rebelxt> lavalamp_: i was doing "light" playouts (i.e. rage bot style, for instance) simulating moves from each player until the end of the game or until winner is clear
2010-11-19T15:07:46  <lavalamp_> I have another heuristic that weights the order I search in
2010-11-19T15:07:58  <lavalamp_> rebelxt, yeah I do super heavy playouts

2010-11-19T15:08:52  <rebelxt> lavalamp_: interesting, are you actually simulating multiple turn playouts (a number of turns for both players)?
2010-11-19T15:09:50  <lavalamp_> no, in theory I then switch to a payoff table to see which of the generated moves is best
2010-11-19T15:10:16  <lavalamp_> the monte carlo stuff is used just to find the best order to execute goals in
2010-11-19T15:10:45  <lavalamp_> considering only a single player
2010-11-19T15:11:28  <lavalamp_> I have high hopes for this stupid bot if I can get it working and fast enough for a depth 2 search
2010-11-19T15:11:28  <rebelxt> ok, i see. mine is different - i tried simulating games till the end using different "light" move generators. kinda like what MC Go programs do
2010-11-19T15:11:55  <lavalamp_> yeah, I'm sorta treating MC my own way :)
2010-11-19T15:12:10  <rebelxt> but even having one minute per turn is not enough to produce good results with light playouts :(
2010-11-19T15:12:24  <lavalamp_> the thing is, in this game random "light" moves are NOT even close to being good
2010-11-19T15:12:37  <lavalamp_> whereas in go the mistakes kinda cancel out
2010-11-19T15:14:00  <McLeopold> I didn't lose against mega1!: http://tcp2.zeroviz.us/canvas.cgi?game_id=678
2010-11-19T15:14:03  <rebelxt> correct, random light moves lead to completely random playouts.. so high number of playouts does not help
2010-11-19T15:14:23  <McLeopold> oh crap, i might have won if it went longer
2010-11-19T15:14:42  <rebelxt> McLeopold: lol at the map
2010-11-19T15:14:43  <lavalamp_> yeah that's why I have such a heavy goal execution... :/
2010-11-19T15:14:58  <lavalamp_> sometimes it works: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1095846
2010-11-19T15:16:31  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: nah he must have a horizon effect near the end
2010-11-19T15:16:37  <McLeopold> maybe
2010-11-19T15:16:40  <lavalamp_> I know my bot does

2010-11-19T15:18:35  <McLeopold> no, those were all hand made
2010-11-19T15:19:43  <rebelxt> McLeopold: that's what i was wondering.. i have some super simple test maps with 3-6 planets for testing sniping, close starts, etc.. could be useful on the tcp2
2010-11-19T15:19:59  <McLeopold> true
2010-11-19T15:20:02  <bhasker> its depressing that at start of tournament one could hope to beat the top bots and there were lot of good ones
2010-11-19T15:20:06  <bhasker> now it looks like there is one good one
2010-11-19T15:20:09  <bhasker> and many average ones:(
2010-11-19T15:20:42  <McLeopold> but, I think it's only useful locally

2010-11-19T15:20:58  <bhasker> lol
2010-11-19T15:21:02  <McLeopold> I created a schedule bot that would do the perfect starts for my hand made maps.

2010-11-19T15:32:21  <bhasker> it doesn't do available ship calculations
2010-11-19T15:32:24  <bhasker> properly
2010-11-19T15:32:35  <bhasker> so it will attack more often
2010-11-19T15:32:41  <bhasker> though might end up losing because of that too
2010-11-19T15:32:45  <bhasker> by sending ships the wrong way
2010-11-19T15:34:26  <bhasker> its launching all ships from 5 growth planets to 3 growth planets
2010-11-19T15:34:30  <bhasker> and losing the 5 growht
2010-11-19T15:34:36  <bhasker> i am amazed it actually managed to win

2010-11-19T15:37:03  <McLeopold> you can find lots of mistakes to analyze
2010-11-19T15:37:15  <Mjothvitnir> there is so much going on I'm not sure where to look
2010-11-19T15:37:25  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-19T15:38:02  <bhasker> its just funny to watch, i just launch all over

2010-11-19T15:42:01  <bhasker> reckless bot does better
2010-11-19T15:42:12  <bhasker> rule to calculate available ships

2010-11-19T16:09:54  <tim_> hey guys, I'm using JBotManager. My bot (rather simple, started yesterday) does work well but for tcp games I always loose after a few turns, I guess due to timeouts. However, my bot seems to be computing pretty fast in "on computer combat" mode. any ideas?
2010-11-19T16:10:45  <Mistmanov> which tcp server are you using?
2010-11-19T16:11:23  <Mistmanov> or alternatively... what name does your bot have?
2010-11-19T16:11:38  <Mistmanov> http://72.44.46.68/getratings are you in that list?
2010-11-19T16:12:12  <tim_> let me check
2010-11-19T16:13:10  <tim_> 72.44.46.68:995, but I'm not in the list
2010-11-19T16:13:32  <tim_> name of bot is "python schummelbot.py" if I understand it correctly ;-)
2010-11-19T16:14:23  <Mjothvitnir> tcp server port _username_  -p pass command
2010-11-19T16:14:42  <tim_> ok, i didnt put anything there :)
2010-11-19T16:14:57  <tim_> do I have to sign up somewhere for that?
2010-11-19T16:15:03  <Mjothvitnir> nope
2010-11-19T16:15:19  <tim_> so first connect sets the acc + pw?
2010-11-19T16:15:27  <Mistmanov> in the manager, in the tcp tab, at the top, you can see the account name and pw
2010-11-19T16:15:35  <Mjothvitnir> basically
2010-11-19T16:15:43  <Mistmanov> you should fill some random stuff in there
2010-11-19T16:17:34  <Mjothvitnir> jbot manager rembers so it really can be random
2010-11-19T16:17:54  <tim_> ok. i did that and in the last 2 round I didnt have a single timeout (using the same code)
2010-11-19T16:17:59  <tim_> weird, but ok

2010-11-19T16:19:10  <Mistmanov> eh, no matter how much I develop, my bot refuses to get any better :p
2010-11-19T16:19:23  <Error323_> hahah, yea i kind of got the same
2010-11-19T16:19:31  <Mistmanov> although changing to the new maps imrproved my bot's winrate from 30-70 to 50-50..
2010-11-19T16:19:40  <Mistmanov> so that's pretty andy

2010-11-19T16:29:57  <tim_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1097545 I lost this game due to "invalid input". whats a good way to find out what I did wrong (because this does not happen everytime)
2010-11-19T16:31:22  <Mistmanov> right before issuing an order
2010-11-19T16:31:31  <Mistmanov> you should check for the basic errors
2010-11-19T16:31:48  <Mistmanov> (sending too many ships, sending from a planet that isn't yours, sending ships to the planet that they came from)
2010-11-19T16:32:08  <lavalamp_> that last one isn't an error
2010-11-19T16:32:11  <Error323_> just debug everything that's you'll finally sent
2010-11-19T16:32:15  <lavalamp_> although it's not useful
2010-11-19T16:32:23  <Mistmanov> I mean when destination is the same as source
2010-11-19T16:32:30  <Mistmanov> that should give an invalid error right?
2010-11-19T16:32:34  <Mjothvitnir> does your issueorders method/function/procedure check src!=dest, src.owner=you, src.ships >= sentships
2010-11-19T16:32:38  <lavalamp_> yeah that doesn't trigger invalid order
2010-11-19T16:33:02  <Mjothvitnir> src==dest is supposed to be an error
2010-11-19T16:33:02  <Mistmanov> ow ok :o
2010-11-19T16:33:33  <lavalamp_> really? my bot did that for the longest time without issue
2010-11-19T16:33:50  <rebelxt> bhasker: watched that game - that was reckless and you got away with it ;-)
2010-11-19T16:33:58  <Mjothvitnir> well "supposed to" and "reality" aren't always the same
2010-11-19T16:35:44  <rebelxt> Mistmanov, glad new maps are working out for you. i had opposite effect - had to fix a number of things
2010-11-19T16:35:58  <Mistmanov> yeah it's a bit random
2010-11-19T16:36:19  <Mistmanov> oh well, i'm not going to win anyway, so the exact results don't worry me too much
2010-11-19T16:37:02  <rebelxt> good games with your new bot on tcp
2010-11-19T16:37:27  <Mistmanov> =)
2010-11-19T16:37:43  <rebelxt> yeah, winning is out of reach for most of us. still fun to waste some time on it ;-)
2010-11-19T16:38:09  <Mistmanov> fun/frustrating
2010-11-19T16:38:10  <Mistmanov> whatever :p
2010-11-19T16:38:15  <Mjothvitnir> Endgame Conditions: A bot issues a command with the same source and destination planet and forfeits the game.
2010-11-19T16:38:46  <Mistmanov> bug hunting is so... ugh right now my bot suddenly starts crashing on a part of the code that has been working just fine for days
2010-11-19T16:38:53  <Mjothvitnir> but, you seem to be right, I don't see that check in the code
2010-11-19T16:39:33  <Error323_> lol
2010-11-19T16:39:34  <rebelxt> haha, yeah debugging is a !@#%$^... i so regret not writing proper test cases from the very beginning
2010-11-19T16:39:43  <Error323_> so do i
2010-11-19T16:39:48  <Error323_> a proper visualizer et
2010-11-19T16:39:50  <Error323_> etc

2010-11-19T16:44:40  <rebelxt> bhasker and mistmanov, our latest bots seem to be about the same strength looking at tcp scores.. we kept trading places
2010-11-19T16:45:04  <Mistmanov> can be =)

2010-11-19T16:45:14  <rebelxt> tim: is nships >0 ?
2010-11-19T16:45:55  <medrimonia> you can't send a negative number of ships and on tcp, you can't send 0 ships
2010-11-19T16:46:10  <Mistmanov> also: are you issuing multiple orders per turn? if so, are you updating the planet's shipscounts?
2010-11-19T16:47:00  <medrimonia> Mistmanov is right too
2010-11-19T16:47:38  <Mistmanov> you should really get your program to print all the orders it's sending. problems then often become instantly clear

2010-11-19T16:52:13  <medrimonia> She maybe, you'll never know^^
2010-11-19T16:52:42  <medrimonia> And I think that if a girl is in irc now, she wouldn't say that she's a girl^^

2010-11-19T16:57:09  <Mistmanov> I loved the effect that mcleopold showed yesterday (?), where he went to capture some neutral in a far of corner, but also some other neutrals on the way
2010-11-19T16:57:21  <Mistmanov> and those extra neutrals also added some ships to the attack
2010-11-19T16:57:28  <medrimonia> Yes that onw was really beautiful

2010-11-19T16:58:04  <Mistmanov> my way of coding something like that would involve 20 nested for loops

2010-11-19T16:59:12  <Mistmanov> Some parts of my script are already getting executed something like 10.000 times per turn
2010-11-19T16:59:25  <JamesMG> I was going to just say "wow"
2010-11-19T16:59:32  <medrimonia> The strangest seen I've seen from mega1 was to attack a neutral planet without taking it
2010-11-19T16:59:47  <JamesMG> but I bet some of my estimations and things get called that many times also
2010-11-19T16:59:50  <medrimonia> My bot has gone after the neutral planet and he took it back after
2010-11-19T16:59:58  <medrimonia> I fixed my bot after...
2010-11-19T17:00:09  <Error323_> well that's probably the danger of it
2010-11-19T17:00:23  <Error323_> since it can't look ahead that much sometimes that will be the sideeffect
2010-11-19T17:00:24  <mega1> medrimonia: yes, that may happen in the above mentioned coordinated attack if it later realizes that it's not going to work
2010-11-19T17:00:52  <JamesMG> mega1: will your bot make an intelligent decision to abandon it's coordinated attack at some point then?
2010-11-19T17:01:16  <JamesMG> mine just lets the attack fail due to a lack of ships or whatever, it's kinda sad
2010-11-19T17:01:16  <mega1> no, it doesn't even know that it's in a coordinated attack
2010-11-19T17:02:15  <medrimonia> I colonize only if I'm sure that I'll have the advantage for some turns, or at least I'm supposed to...
2010-11-19T17:03:00  <medrimonia> Oh nice game!
2010-11-19T17:03:24  <medrimonia> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7994668
2010-11-19T17:04:22  <medrimonia> something like turn 52
2010-11-19T17:05:04  <medrimonia> That's absolutely not as this that my bot is supposed to work... but it worked
2010-11-19T17:05:15  <Mistmanov> at least that's something
2010-11-19T17:05:17  <Error323_> in my current version on tcp and official i accidently disable sniping >_<
2010-11-19T17:05:36  <Mistmanov> you have a specific algorithm for sniping?
2010-11-19T17:05:42  <Error323_> yes
2010-11-19T17:05:47  <medrimonia> Mistmanov: yep
2010-11-19T17:05:54  <Mistmanov> mine just does it by default (it sees a weakly defended friendly -->> attack it)
2010-11-19T17:05:56  <Error323_> sniping, attacking, defending
2010-11-19T17:06:00  <Error323_> ye so does mine
2010-11-19T17:06:06  <Error323_> but it shouldn't
2010-11-19T17:06:27  <Error323_> or well sniping is so important imo that it should get high priority
2010-11-19T17:06:47  <Mistmanov> I don't know if it makes much difference
2010-11-19T17:06:53  <Error323_> well it does here
2010-11-19T17:07:04  <Error323_> since i sort my actions using some heuristic
2010-11-19T17:07:05  <medrimonia> mine is like : defending, snipping, attacking adversary, expand, redistribute with other extra stuff
2010-11-19T17:07:19  <Error323_> but sniping should get more priority
2010-11-19T17:07:31  <Mistmanov> hmm
2010-11-19T17:07:54  <Error323_> a heuristic i need to change really
2010-11-19T17:07:56  <Error323_> :w
2010-11-19T17:08:00  <Error323_> oops wrong window
2010-11-19T17:08:30  <medrimonia> hmmm in fact, what I wanted to do (but I haven't enough time) was to score each move (snip, attack,defend etc...) and sort it after.
2010-11-19T17:08:47  <medrimonia> But now my bot is very conservative
2010-11-19T17:08:51  <Error323_> yes that's my idea aswell
2010-11-19T17:08:52  <Error323_> ^_^
2010-11-19T17:09:03  <Error323_> i do it sort of already
2010-11-19T17:09:14  <Error323_> but it can be done much better

2010-11-19T17:09:46  <Mistmanov> so now I just go "generally, defense is more profitable than offense", so do defense first
2010-11-19T17:10:24  <medrimonia> Mistmanov: I've said that I score my move, not that I score them rightly. =P

2010-11-19T17:10:32  <Error323_> indeed
2010-11-19T17:10:40  <medrimonia> raschi just reuploads.
2010-11-19T17:10:46  <Error323_> its kinda desparate :P

2010-11-19T17:10:53  <medrimonia> You don't need to add any thing after =P
2010-11-19T17:10:54  <Error323_> or whatever :P
2010-11-19T17:10:56  <JamesMG> to what end?  Not like that's a valid long term strategy
2010-11-19T17:11:02  <Mistmanov> eh, if he enjoys seeing his name on the leader board, let him I'd say
2010-11-19T17:11:17  <Mistmanov> the only leaderboard that counts is made after the uploading is turned of =)
2010-11-19T17:11:21  <JamesMG> exactly

2010-11-19T17:11:25  <Error323_> d
2010-11-19T17:11:45  <Error323_> Mistmanov: given that, why haven't you uploaded anything new?
2010-11-19T17:12:00  <Mistmanov> because I don't care about the leaderboard :p
2010-11-19T17:12:21  <Mistmanov> packing up a .zip file is more trouble than I'm willing to take
2010-11-19T17:12:26  <Mistmanov> -_-
2010-11-19T17:12:28  <Error323_> lol

2010-11-19T17:12:50  <Error323_> lol well not for me :P
2010-11-19T17:12:54  <Error323_> i was just wondering =)
2010-11-19T17:13:24  <Mistmanov> ok, so maybe it was a bit because seeing a new submission rank lower feels bad :p
2010-11-19T17:13:51  <Error323_> ah so instead of not caring, you care a lot :P
2010-11-19T17:14:55  <Mistmanov> somewhat..
2010-11-19T17:14:59  <Mistmanov> uploading now ;)

2010-11-19T17:35:17  <Error323_> d
2010-11-19T17:35:20  <Error323_> complete change

2010-11-19T17:36:37  <McLeopold> that game just looks neat at the end
2010-11-19T17:36:41  <mega1> medrimonia: how do your bots on tcp relate to the submitted one?
2010-11-19T17:37:17  <McLeopold> at turn 53 ish
2010-11-19T17:37:58  <bhasker> rainfall
2010-11-19T17:38:03  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-19T17:38:29  <McLeopold> this game makes a great screensaver

2010-11-19T17:42:46  <medrimonia> the submitted version is the r64
2010-11-19T17:42:48  <Error323_> ok lets upload this one aswell
2010-11-19T17:42:53  <Error323_> E323-18.0-2-g4a95d58
2010-11-19T17:43:02  <medrimonia> I don't even think I've tested it on tcp
2010-11-19T17:43:20  <mega1> so it seems
2010-11-19T17:43:26  <medrimonia> no. so it's related to the r63
2010-11-19T17:43:26  <bhasker> that was a nice game to watch mcleopold
2010-11-19T17:43:28  <mega1> so how did you test it?
2010-11-19T17:43:36  <McLeopold> mega1: turn 14, lower right
2010-11-19T17:43:38  <McLeopold> wtf?
2010-11-19T17:43:56  <medrimonia> from the r63 to the r64, there was just a minor change
2010-11-19T17:44:16  <medrimonia> because I had sometimes an index error in the 63
2010-11-19T17:45:36  <medrimonia> mega1: I've a lot of problem on the tcp, because I've a bad connection
2010-11-19T17:46:02  <Error323_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1098350 lol creaping out of death
2010-11-19T17:46:03  <mega1> wow, all those Ts
2010-11-19T17:46:53  <medrimonia> Ts?
2010-11-19T17:46:54  <mega1> you should be about 65% without those timeouts
2010-11-19T17:47:08  <mega1> Timeouts are displayed as Loss(T)
2010-11-19T17:47:23  <McLeopold> Error323_: nice draw
2010-11-19T17:47:24  <medrimonia> Thanks
2010-11-19T17:47:43  <medrimonia> Yes I'll try some bots tomorrow at my university
2010-11-19T17:47:53  <Mistmanov> j's and i's look to much alike at this time of day :(
2010-11-19T17:48:05  <Error323_> McLeopold: its not a draw
2010-11-19T17:48:06  <Error323_> =)
2010-11-19T17:48:08  <Error323_> i won
2010-11-19T17:48:17  <Error323_> but the visualizer doesn't see that
2010-11-19T17:48:21  <Error323_> show that*
2010-11-19T17:48:39  <McLeopold> yea, it shows 698 to 698
2010-11-19T17:48:59  <Error323_> yea, though my growthrate is slightly higher
2010-11-19T17:49:02  <Error323_> 1 planet more
2010-11-19T17:49:02  <bhasker> whatever happened to all the shampoo bots
2010-11-19T17:49:05  <bhasker> flag you still around?
2010-11-19T17:49:11  <Error323_> so i won by 1 more ship
2010-11-19T17:49:16  <Error323_> at turn 200
2010-11-19T17:49:16  <McLeopold> ?
2010-11-19T17:49:19  <Error323_> awesomeness =)
2010-11-19T17:49:34  <McLeopold> do you get growth at the very end?

2010-11-19T17:50:19  <bhasker> i think the engine simulates one turn beyond 200
2010-11-19T17:50:21  <bhasker> or 2
2010-11-19T17:50:23  <bhasker> not sure
2010-11-19T17:50:34  <McLeopold> that would be a bug?
2010-11-19T17:50:46  <janzert> no
2010-11-19T17:50:54  <bhasker> i think it takes the orders at turn 200
2010-11-19T17:50:58  <bhasker> and calculates state at 201
2010-11-19T17:51:00  <janzert> what the visualizer shows is the state at the beginning of the turn not the end
2010-11-19T17:51:13  <janzert> i.e. 1 of 200 is the starting state
2010-11-19T17:51:20  <janzert> before the first turn
2010-11-19T17:51:29  <janzert> and 200 of 200 is the state just before the last turn
2010-11-19T17:51:44  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-19T17:52:39  <McLeopold> I'll update that then, so the visualizer shows correctly.
2010-11-19T17:52:55  <janzert> I don't think the engine records the final state though
2010-11-19T17:53:11  <janzert> basically it is the state sent to the bots for that turn
2010-11-19T17:53:22  <McLeopold> but it uses it for determining the winner
2010-11-19T17:53:37  <janzert> and since the bots do not ever receive the final state the visualizer doesn't get it either
2010-11-19T17:53:54  <McLeopold> it ought to at least record the ending state, no?
2010-11-19T17:53:59  <Error323_> bhasker: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1098450 :D
2010-11-19T17:54:01  <janzert> it would be nice
2010-11-19T17:54:05  <Error323_> :P
2010-11-19T17:54:45  <bhasker> yea it blew it midway
2010-11-19T17:54:56  <janzert> I've been kind of surprised that it hasn't been a larger issue in the forums and had someone pursue it in the code
2010-11-19T17:54:58  <Error323_> ye

2010-11-19T17:55:38  <janzert> but since it's mostly just a cosmetic thing from my perspective I haven't bothered
2010-11-19T17:55:44  <Error323_> bhasker: the amount of times i've lost at turn 200 is just annoying
2010-11-19T17:55:46  <Error323_> :/
2010-11-19T17:56:32  <McLeopold> it would be nice for the entire data of the game to be correct, so you could look at the last state and determine the outcome.
2010-11-19T17:56:50  <McLeopold> otherwise, you'd have to simulate one turn everytime you wanted to know who won
2010-11-19T17:57:03  <McLeopold> (assuming there wasn't a flag)

2010-11-19T18:06:21  <bhasker> heh i lose to flavor!
2010-11-19T18:06:43  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm, wierd. It's been quite a while since I looked at it either I must either have misunderstood something then or am misremembering
2010-11-19T18:07:03  <janzert> I'm pretty sure the visualizer on the main site never shows the end state though either
2010-11-19T18:07:09  <bhasker> lol interesting game http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1098465
2010-11-19T18:07:15  <janzert> so I doubt it's something specific to dhartmei's setup

2010-11-19T18:08:48  <mega1> I don't like these rock paper scissor maps too much.
2010-11-19T18:08:57  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-19T18:09:03  <bhasker> a lot of the new maps i feel have to do with who is aggresive
2010-11-19T18:09:06  <bhasker> and lucky enough to get away with
2010-11-19T18:09:09  <mega1> good thing that bix0r likes them even less: http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=8565
2010-11-19T18:09:24  <bhasker> if someone happens to throw to center and other doesn't

2010-11-19T18:10:24  <bhasker> yea but sometimes center is expensive and you get sniped

2010-11-19T18:14:46  <McLeopold> Nope
2010-11-19T18:15:00  <McLeopold> your first matches are against bot near your last rank
2010-11-19T18:15:12  <Migi32> ok
2010-11-19T18:15:33  <Migi32> that's probably better
2010-11-19T18:18:14  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3458), bix0r4ever(3360), wagstaff(3137), murrayr(3137), BaronTrozo(3115), protocolocon(3104), smloh1(3090), Raschi(3085), davidjliu(3083), george(3080)
2010-11-19T18:18:21  <smloh1> woooot! i will enjoy my transient time in the top 10 while i can :)
2010-11-19T18:19:16  <mega1> smloh1: you've been as high as 3rd I think
2010-11-19T18:20:03  <smloh1> that was because i had just resubmitted and managed to beat shangas
2010-11-19T18:20:16  <Error323_> I freakin hate it when i lose to noobs >_<
2010-11-19T18:20:17  <Error323_> bah
2010-11-19T18:20:33  <Error323_> that is, much lower ranked ppl
2010-11-19T18:21:56  <smloh1> i'm sure as more games are played i'll drop out again, but it's nice to be reported by contestbot
2010-11-19T18:21:57  <mega1> any news on the final tournament?
2010-11-19T18:22:46  <janzert> mega1: what sort of news?
2010-11-19T18:23:04  <mega1> swiss sytem / round robin / etc
2010-11-19T18:23:15  <mega1> map selection as we have today?
2010-11-19T18:23:19  <janzert> not that I've heard of
2010-11-19T18:23:38  <janzert> right now I'm going to push for keeping the same as we have
2010-11-19T18:23:38  <mega1> it would be nice to know
2010-11-19T18:23:58  <janzert> and slowly eliminating bottom ranked players if we aren't getting enough games
2010-11-19T18:24:06  <mega1> because if it's a top 10 round robin I may take a different approach
2010-11-19T18:24:20  <janzert> to give good ranking order
2010-11-19T18:24:37  <mega1> I get the feeling that what works against the top bots may not work against the lower ranked ones and vice versa.
2010-11-19T18:25:03  <janzert> but I may be able to do some more work on pairing before the contest ends so we'll see
2010-11-19T18:25:20  <janzert> I don't want to go to a completely new untested system just for the final though
2010-11-19T18:25:29  <janzert> if we can help it at least :)
2010-11-19T18:25:40  <mega1> sure, and I'm not here to push you into that direction
2010-11-19T18:26:05  <janzert> of course you've seen as much communication from Jeff as I have so...
2010-11-19T18:26:25  <janzert> it's always possible he will step in and do something completely different
2010-11-19T18:26:25  <mega1> did we have a top 100 round robin for tron?
2010-11-19T18:26:31  <janzert> no
2010-11-19T18:26:38  <mega1> how was it?
2010-11-19T18:26:38  <bhasker> mcleopold tcp2 is very lonely
2010-11-19T18:26:41  <bhasker> going to switch to tcp1
2010-11-19T18:26:50  <McLeopold> :(
2010-11-19T18:26:59  <janzert> he did cut it down to just the top 100 competitors competing for the last day of the final tournament though
2010-11-19T18:27:00  <bhasker> its just you and me duking it out
2010-11-19T18:27:10  <janzert> but the pairing didn't change for it at all
2010-11-19T18:27:14  <McLeopold> not really, that's my old bot
2010-11-19T18:27:22  <McLeopold> just there so something is
2010-11-19T18:27:35  <McLeopold> but tcp2 really shows you your flaws
2010-11-19T18:28:26  <McLeopold> by old bot does alot better on the crazy_fast
2010-11-19T18:28:29  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-19T18:28:57  <McLeopold> bhasker: like your invalids
2010-11-19T18:29:13  <bhasker> oh i know whats causing that, just don't have the time right now to track it down
2010-11-19T18:29:25  <bhasker> i am not adjusting my remaining ships after lauching a fleet
2010-11-19T18:29:30  <bhasker> so i end up double launching

2010-11-19T18:32:07  <bhasker> nope
2010-11-19T18:32:10  <mega1> janzert: let us know when you have the pairing decided or you even at the idea phase
2010-11-19T18:32:13  <bhasker> i got introduced to this by a1k0n
2010-11-19T18:32:15  <Error323_> janzert: why are the servers slow? :P
2010-11-19T18:32:20  <bhasker> who wisely dropped out after i got hooked
2010-11-19T18:32:21  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-19T18:32:31  <Error323_> hehe
2010-11-19T18:33:03  <janzert> mega1: look like the best idea is keep an idea on the "final tournament checklist" thread. Jeff posted in there a little earlier, I'm replying now
2010-11-19T18:35:09  <janzert> s/keep an idea on/keep an eye on

2010-11-19T18:52:15  <janzert> amstan: are you sure there was a top 25 round robin? my memory is that Jeff just limited the games played to the top contestants he didn't change the pairing at all
2010-11-19T18:52:22  <janzert> for the tron contest that is
2010-11-19T18:52:32  <amstan> janzert: that's what's what i meant

2010-11-19T19:14:05  <janzert> at this point most likely 50
