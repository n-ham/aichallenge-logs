2011-05-09T22:30:19  <amstan> McLeopold: create_test_data crashes
2011-05-09T22:30:27  <amstan> something about duplicate users
2011-05-09T22:30:54  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-09T22:30:59  <McLeopold> I'll try it
2011-05-09T22:31:17  <McLeopold> are you going to stick around tonight?  I'm committed to getting the server off the ground tonight
2011-05-09T22:31:58  <amstan> for an hour maybe, i can't more, i have school tomorrow
2011-05-09T22:32:55  <McLeopold> okay, maybe we can ignore the create test data and just get the worker going
2011-05-09T22:33:15  <amstan> that's fine.. worker going.. the sandboxes work
2011-05-09T22:33:28  <amstan> the database on the server might not be up to date
2011-05-09T22:33:54  <amstan> so.. it's all a matter of running ./worker.py properly(idk how)
2011-05-09T22:34:09  <McLeopold> ok, I'm trying to log in...
2011-05-09T22:35:14  <McLeopold> want to start a screen session?
2011-05-09T22:35:35  <amstan> i would, but screen doesn't like when you su
2011-05-09T22:36:10  <McLeopold> I've gotten it to work on a ubuntu server before
2011-05-09T22:37:17  <McLeopold> you need to set the setuid on
2011-05-09T22:40:23  <McLeopold> amstan: where does apache point to?
2011-05-09T22:40:41  <amstan>  /home/contest/aichallenge/website
2011-05-09T22:40:47  <amstan> the default
2011-05-09T22:40:58  <McLeopold> okay, can I run the worker in the worker dir?
2011-05-09T22:41:54  <amstan> yep
2011-05-09T22:42:13  <McLeopold> should I have write permission in the /home/contest dir?
2011-05-09T22:42:23  <amstan> just sudo su contest
2011-05-09T22:45:56  <McLeopold> I'm setting up the worker to have it's own set of maps and submissions
2011-05-09T22:47:20  <McLeopold> They need to be separate from the manager's locations, so if you running both on the same server, they need to be different
2011-05-09T22:51:06  <amstan> you sure?
2011-05-09T22:51:14  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-09T22:51:22  <amstan> you have to modify the setup script then
2011-05-09T22:51:36  <McLeopold> the workers can run separate, so they need the ability to cache downloaded submissions and maps
2011-05-09T22:51:52  <McLeopold> That's why I had a separate server_info template in each main folder :)
2011-05-09T22:53:57  <McLeopold> what's the compiled dir for?
2011-05-09T23:00:53  <amstan> McLeopold: i have no idea
2011-05-09T23:00:58  <amstan> i just installed it from the script
2011-05-09T23:01:02  <amstan> i'd assume it's just defaults
2011-05-09T23:01:08  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-09T23:01:22  <McLeopold> I haven't run the setup script lately, so I'm not sure
2011-05-09T23:02:46  <McLeopold> amstan: can the contest user modify apache settings?
2011-05-09T23:03:10  <amstan> it shouldn't
2011-05-09T23:03:17  <McLeopold> okay, then can I?
2011-05-09T23:03:33  <McLeopold> or you?
2011-05-09T23:04:24  <McLeopold> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/games/ should point to /home/contest/ants/games and serve static files
2011-05-09T23:04:41  <McLeopold> amstan: same with maps
2011-05-09T23:05:17  <amstan> ok, so add that to the setup script
2011-05-09T23:05:49  <McLeopold> ok...
2011-05-09T23:08:21  <McLeopold> amstan: where to the templates get their values from?
2011-05-09T23:08:39  <amstan> what templates?
2011-05-09T23:09:18  <McLeopold> the server_info templates in the setup folder
2011-05-09T23:09:43  <McLeopold> amstan: and do you have a single command you run to clean the contest home dir and redo everything?
2011-05-09T23:10:00  <amstan> McLeopold: no, it's not that simple
2011-05-09T23:10:10  <amstan> there's users setup, stuff in /srv
2011-05-09T23:10:12  <amstan> packages..
2011-05-09T23:10:19  <amstan> i would be careful
2011-05-09T23:10:26  <amstan> don't edit stuff directly there unless you have a plan
2011-05-09T23:10:38  <McLeopold> don't edit stuff in /srv?
2011-05-09T23:10:56  <amstan> ideally not...
2011-05-09T23:10:58  <amstan> why?
2011-05-09T23:11:25  <McLeopold> okay, I know what the /home/contest folders and files *should* look like, but I'm not familiar with our setup stuff
2011-05-09T23:11:36  <McLeopold> I just need a little direction
2011-05-09T23:11:41  <amstan>  /srv is the sandbox for the contest
2011-05-09T23:11:53  <amstan> it's pretty much a replica of ubuntu, where the jail users are chrooted into
2011-05-09T23:12:04  <amstan> there's no contest code in there
2011-05-09T23:12:08  <McLeopold> ok

2011-05-09T23:30:11  <janzert> I'm basically just ignoring semaphore_cleanup for now, with the new version of mono being used hopefully there won't be anything leaking semaphores, but at the same time there isn't anything new preventing someone from leaking semaphores on purpose as a DoS
2011-05-09T23:30:31  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-09T23:30:38  <McLeopold> I heard somewhere mono is dying
2011-05-09T23:31:31  <McLeopold> janzert: also, I'm attempting to get our hypertriangle server going tonight
2011-05-09T23:32:34  <janzert> the compiled dir is the default name for the worker submission_dir so it doesn't interfere with a manager submission_dir when both are running from the same location
2011-05-09T23:32:59  <McLeopold> oh
2011-05-09T23:33:11  <McLeopold> I was going to use a different structure
2011-05-09T23:33:43  <janzert> caught up with the conversation now :)
2011-05-09T23:33:48  <McLeopold> k :)
2011-05-09T23:34:39  <janzert> I saw just the other day you're using a compiled and download directory inside the worker submission_dir
2011-05-09T23:34:46  <McLeopold> yep
2011-05-09T23:35:01  <janzert> the current implementation reintroduces a race condition btw
2011-05-09T23:35:16  <janzert> if more than one worker.py is running
2011-05-09T23:35:27  <McLeopold> I was thinking only 1 at a time
2011-05-09T23:35:56  <janzert> I kinda figured that
2011-05-09T23:36:02  <janzert> and that may be all we do now
2011-05-09T23:36:13  <McLeopold> If we need it to work in parallel, we can add threading to it
2011-05-09T23:36:20  <janzert> I was trying to keep everything safe
2011-05-09T23:37:19  <janzert> threading has lots more potential for problems though :/
2011-05-09T23:37:28  <janzert> but I suspect we won't need either
2011-05-09T23:37:33  <McLeopold> k
2011-05-09T23:37:46  <janzert> we're probably going to max out a machine with just one anyway
2011-05-09T23:37:50  <McLeopold> can you stick around and help get the server setup going right now?
2011-05-09T23:37:58  <McLeopold> http://ietherpad.com/meUeSqyZit
2011-05-09T23:38:20  <janzert> for a bit anyway, although I think I walked amstan through everything I know last night
2011-05-09T23:38:43  <McLeopold> amstan's: got to go soon, and I want to get this done
2011-05-09T23:38:49  <janzert> btw, working on the compiler right now and...
2011-05-09T23:39:11  <amstan> McLeopold: well.. what are you trying to do? do you just want to move submissions to another place?
2011-05-09T23:39:32  <janzert> it seems like we really want an area outside the submission's actual code/bot directory to store metadata
2011-05-09T23:39:34  <McLeopold> yes, and maybe more
2011-05-09T23:39:43  <McLeopold> I want to iron stuff out until it works right
2011-05-09T23:39:53  <janzert> e.g. I don't like that we are putting that run.sh into the submissions directory directly
2011-05-09T23:40:24  <McLeopold> I thought doing that would give us a natural transition to compiled submissions
2011-05-09T23:40:47  <janzert> so maybe a structure such as the submission directory then has a subdirectory called bot that would hold the actual submitted code
2011-05-09T23:41:42  <janzert> mostly I'd just rather not open the chance that we overwrite or change some part of the submission itself
2011-05-09T23:42:12  <janzert> i.e. what is uploaded is what gets run there with no chance that we accidently change it
2011-05-09T23:42:25  <McLeopold> can you put that on the ietherpad
2011-05-09T23:44:36  <janzert> why does the worker store games at all?
2011-05-09T23:44:54  <janzert> shouldn't it just be sending them back to the manager?
2011-05-09T23:44:54  <McLeopold> just in case, we can turn it off
2011-05-09T23:45:30  <McLeopold> At some point I was going to put retry code in if there was a transmission issue
2011-05-09T23:45:53  <janzert> hmm, at most you lose one game
2011-05-09T23:45:59  <janzert> doesn't seem worth the storage
2011-05-09T23:46:04  <janzert> and complexity
2011-05-09T23:46:05  <McLeopold> yeah, not a big deal
2011-05-09T23:47:51  <McLeopold> how does/should the api_keys get set?
2011-05-09T23:48:20  <janzert> the worker api keys? or the worker creation key?
2011-05-09T23:48:26  <McLeopold> both
2011-05-09T23:48:40  <amstan> McLeopold: the main one, you randomly generate it manually
2011-05-09T23:48:47  <McLeopold> where?
2011-05-09T23:48:52  <amstan> the second one you get from this php page, apt_server_setup i think
2011-05-09T23:48:56  <janzert> the worker keys are created in api_server_setup.php and stored in the database
2011-05-09T23:49:04  <amstan> and you give it to the worker setup script
2011-05-09T23:49:20  <amstan> which in turn sets the server_info.py file in worker/
2011-05-09T23:49:27  <janzert> the worker creation key is created manually and stored in server_info.php
2011-05-09T23:51:20  <CIA-33> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r4735cdb / (3 files): added/deleted keys from templates - http://bit.ly/m9MC7W
2011-05-09T23:56:12  <McLeopold> janzert: i think we can do the structure that you would like
2011-05-09T23:56:36  <McLeopold> right now after compile and before functional testing is when the move is done
2011-05-09T23:56:58  <McLeopold> I can change that do be after functional test
2011-05-09T23:57:29  <janzert> we'll never use the submission again if it fails the functional test right?
2011-05-09T23:57:36  <janzert> same as failing compilation?
2011-05-09T23:57:45  <McLeopold> I think so
2011-05-09T23:58:20  <janzert> I'm pretty sure that's true and we can just delete the temporary directory if it fails either or both stages
2011-05-09T23:58:22  <McLeopold> the reason I moved it then was that after the compile step, I wouldn't be able to detect the language anymore, so I needed 2 dirs so I knew which had the run.sh and which didn't
2011-05-09T23:59:11  <McLeopold> It's not actually mod 1000, it's div 1000
2011-05-09T23:59:23  <janzert> oops :)
2011-05-09T23:59:34  <McLeopold> I did that in the code until I started testing it :)
2011-05-09T23:59:42  <McLeopold> mod is just so fun, like xor
