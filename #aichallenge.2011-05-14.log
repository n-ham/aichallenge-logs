2011-05-14T08:36:35  <janzert> is that replay using the current engine?
2011-05-14T08:36:58  <Frontier> no, I realize that it is not correct
2011-05-14T08:37:23  <janzert> ok, I was hoping it wasn't supposed to be :)
2011-05-14T08:37:25  <Frontier> It is an ancient replay I just keep around forever because I'm lazy.
2011-05-14T08:37:48  <Frontier> I keep fixing it up to meet the specs every time there is a change though :p
2011-05-14T08:38:14  <Frontier> Just now the old error in the attack radius shows through badly.
2011-05-14T08:39:06  <Frontier> game_id isn't even 100% json, but seems to have correct behaviour
2011-05-14T08:40:59  <janzert> what do the solid and unfilled stars next to the names mean?
2011-05-14T08:41:07  <janzert> just that there isn't a rank?
2011-05-14T08:42:13  <Frontier> Ok, that didn't work out then ^^
2011-05-14T08:42:17  <janzert> or I guess rather they are 1st and second place
2011-05-14T08:42:32  <Frontier> rank 1 and 2 get stars
2011-05-14T08:42:46  <Frontier> the solid star is rank #1
2011-05-14T08:42:52  <janzert> ahh
2011-05-14T08:43:47  <janzert> also are those ranks from the replay, i.e. at the time of the game or current as of the time the game is viewed?
2011-05-14T08:43:48  <Frontier> The rank in text form takes up a bit of space. So I tried symbols.
2011-05-14T08:44:18  <janzert> that's the other thing I was going to ask what happens when all for ranks are 4 digits?
2011-05-14T08:44:27  <janzert> four ranks even
2011-05-14T08:44:41  <Frontier> 4 digits? time of the game?
2011-05-14T08:45:06  <Frontier> The ranks are determined by the final scores. There is no change over time.
2011-05-14T08:45:09  <janzert> ahh, these aren't the player's leaderboard rank?
2011-05-14T08:45:24  <janzert> that's what was shown in the past with the player name
2011-05-14T08:45:45  <Frontier> you are right, janzert. i ignored that.
2011-05-14T08:47:06  <Frontier> No that we have more than just winner/loser I wonder if we should drop the leaderbord rank in favor of a current game rank.
2011-05-14T08:48:02  <janzert> yeah, I'm not sure. I know generally when I was looking at games of my own with tron the opponents rank was usually more interesting to me than the actual name though
2011-05-14T08:48:27  <janzert> as in yay I beat someone 50 ranks above me or ugh I lost to someone 100 ranks below
2011-05-14T08:49:43  <janzert> maybe the names should move to the bottom of the page and become a list/table
2011-05-14T08:49:58  <janzert> with game rank, score and overall rank
2011-05-14T08:50:16  <janzert> that'll give the room for 9+ player names as well
2011-05-14T08:50:35  <janzert> sort of a scoreboard maybe?
2011-05-14T08:52:11  <Frontier> i see, ok. I would want to keep such a table inside the canvas, so I have it in the Java version as well and don't parse the replay twice.
2011-05-14T08:52:52  <janzert> just an idea too, up to you if it seems to work better or not
2011-05-14T08:52:56  <Frontier> Then the resize code would have to be adapted. In the standalone player the height would include the table, in a website the talbe would be excluded
2011-05-14T08:53:51  <Frontier> The current version is confusing players and I don't want to take the good feeling away that you just beat someone 50 rank point above you ;)
2011-05-14T08:53:58  <janzert> just noticed when zoomed out all the way the mouseover square selection seems messed up for me on the lower third or so of the board
2011-05-14T08:55:05  <Frontier> oh maybe a copy&pase bug, looks like it jumps as soon as you go beyond the map width, instead of map height
2011-05-14T08:55:22  <janzert> ahh, yeah that could be it
2011-05-14T08:56:18  <Frontier> yup, will be fixed in the next commit
2011-05-14T08:57:29  <janzert> nice when they can be fixed that easily
2011-05-14T08:58:19  <Frontier> I mean the mouse position, not the player table Oo
2011-05-14T08:58:43  * janzert nods :)
2011-05-14T08:59:26  <Frontier> Oh wait, I cannot display the player rank easily. This visualizer was meant to work without db connection.
2011-05-14T09:00:37  <janzert> hmm, I wonder if the manager could add them to the replay data when it receives it from the worker
2011-05-14T09:01:39  <janzert> it would still be a static file request for the visualizer that way
2011-05-14T09:02:05  <Frontier> That would work.

2011-05-14T09:04:12  <Frontier> I wonder how the global ranking page will look like
2011-05-14T09:04:42  <janzert> say things like maximum ants alive at once and total ants for that player
2011-05-14T09:06:55  <Frontier> ok, that is something that needs no support from the engine. Let's see how much space there is left on the line. Some players may have long names
2011-05-14T09:07:19  <janzert> yeah, that was a bit of a problem in the past
2011-05-14T09:09:28  <Frontier> now we have variable length names + variable player counts. I was surprised how diffuclt things became in the visualizer. I made the player buttons wrap to the next line when the don't fit. I added letters on the ants for color-blind people, because we have so many more colors now than in planet wars.

2011-05-14T11:42:13  <McLeopold> Frontier, the visualizer is awesome
2011-05-14T11:43:34  <Frontier> oh hi, good to see you and thank you. I get so many compliments for the visualizer recently, I really hope I can iron out the last usability killers before we start.
2011-05-14T11:44:01  <Frontier> how are the two visualizer issues doing? do player links work for you?
2011-05-14T11:44:34  <antimatroid1> Frontier: there's some weird behaviour from the white square cursor
2011-05-14T11:44:40  <McLeopold> let me check, I need to run some games on hypertriangle first
2011-05-14T11:44:43  <antimatroid1> when the map isn't centered
2011-05-14T11:44:54  <McLeopold> I saw that too, when zoomed in
2011-05-14T11:44:56  <Frontier> and do I have to change things for the food bonus or is it ok to display the last score entry in the list?
2011-05-14T11:45:17  <Frontier> I have two known bugs there.
2011-05-14T11:45:26  <antimatroid1> it's not shifting where it thinks the boundaries are for verticals, ahh ok :)
2011-05-14T11:45:36  <Frontier> Don't worry, I didn't run a lot of tests before I commited
2011-05-14T11:46:55  <Frontier> So this is beta quality at its bes
2011-05-14T11:47:04  <McLeopold> Frontier: if the scores don't make sense, we can try and adjust what the engine outputs
2011-05-14T11:47:54  <Frontier> the engine outputs the scores with food bonus, if I read the source code correctly. that's fine for me - i.e. nothing to do :p

2011-05-14T11:50:26  <Frontier> in that case, the visualizer should display the last score entry correctly and the issue be closed. otherwise if you have a good idea how to display the food bonus i may implement that.

2011-05-14T12:44:48  <amstan> everything just breaks in ubuntu
2011-05-14T12:44:53  <mcstar> deKorator
2011-05-14T12:44:56  <mcstar> thats it
2011-05-14T12:45:14  <mcstar> all the themes you can download are scripts for decorator
2011-05-14T12:46:15  <mcstar> amstan: does it work for you?
2011-05-14T12:46:51  <Frontier> In Gnome they changed the way the default browser is configured. Now depending on application it wants to open either Chrome, Opera or FireFox. It is really funny.
2011-05-14T12:47:29  <Frontier> best of all I have only Firefox in the list of options where I want to set Opera
2011-05-14T12:47:42  <mcstar> i strongly beleive this error is purely kde's fault
2011-05-14T12:47:59  <mcstar> my software is not really patched
2011-05-14T12:48:06  <mcstar> arch doesnt modifiy anything
2011-05-14T12:48:19  <Frontier> amstan: btw, how is the ants beta timeline progressing?
2011-05-14T12:48:19  <mcstar> Frontier: gnome 3?
2011-05-14T12:48:35  <Frontier> mcstar: no, gnome 2.9.9.9 or something :p
2011-05-14T12:48:40  <amstan> Frontier: not as good as i would want it, but it's going..
2011-05-14T12:48:46  <Frontier> i have a rolling distro, too: gentoo
2011-05-14T12:49:01  <mcstar> that 3 then :D
2011-05-14T12:49:06  <amstan> there's an error with the worker when it's using sandboxes, it works without the sandbox
2011-05-14T12:49:12  <amstan> and we still need a ranking page
2011-05-14T12:50:14  <Frontier> ah, that gives me an overview, thx
2011-05-14T12:50:28  <amstan> Frontier: oh.. right, since i caught you here
2011-05-14T12:50:49  <amstan> is there a way you can fix the issue with the full screen visualizer?
2011-05-14T12:51:13  <amstan> in my global css for html i have overflow-y: scroll;
2011-05-14T12:51:14  <Frontier> Is there an issue as in github issue, or something you just noticed?
2011-05-14T12:51:24  <amstan> something i noticed
2011-05-14T12:51:33  <amstan> anyway.. overflow-y: scroll; makes it so there's always a scrollbar
2011-05-14T12:51:45  <amstan> so there's no moving between pages
2011-05-14T12:51:56  <Frontier> hmm, maybe you just want to let the visualizer know that fullscreen is a bad option in that case?
2011-05-14T12:52:13  <amstan> the scrollbar will always appear, on all the pages
2011-05-14T12:52:13  <Frontier> what do you want to happen?
2011-05-14T12:52:30  <Frontier> on ALL pages? even visualizer.php?
2011-05-14T12:52:37  <amstan> so when you go from a short page, to a longer page, the content doesn't jump 5 pixels to make room ofr the scrollbar
2011-05-14T12:52:38  <amstan> yes
2011-05-14T12:53:32  <Frontier> I guess I should find that property and override it while in fullscreen mode, right?
2011-05-14T12:53:45  <amstan> you could
2011-05-14T12:54:29  <Frontier> do I have other options?
2011-05-14T12:54:47  <amstan> you could make the visualizer smaller
2011-05-14T12:55:00  <Frontier> it is a fullscreen option :p
2011-05-14T12:55:13  <amstan> yes.. but compensate for the size of the scrollbar
2011-05-14T12:55:24  <Frontier> does that work across browsers?
2011-05-14T12:55:33  <amstan> the overflow-y? yes
2011-05-14T12:56:06  <amstan> i think you're using browser window size, you should be using something like body width
2011-05-14T12:56:11  <Frontier> i mean getting the size of a ascrollbar
2011-05-14T12:56:39  <Frontier> body width... hmm. yeah i settled with window.clientHeight or something
2011-05-14T12:56:57  <amstan> anyway.. i would try overriding it instead
2011-05-14T12:58:15  <Frontier> sure. and... on other pages where you embed the visualizer you may want to disable fullscreen mode.
2011-05-14T12:58:47  <Frontier> since you can save the fullscreen setting as default it would make these pages unusable until the user returns to the small size
2011-05-14T12:58:49  <amstan> why?
2011-05-14T12:59:17  <amstan> well.. maybe ignore the setting on the other pages
2011-05-14T12:59:26  <amstan> don't go to fullscreen by default
2011-05-14T12:59:40  <Frontier> it would be better if I added a constructor option that overrides user settings though :p
2011-05-14T13:00:12  <amstan> in terms of disabling the overflow-y, you could add a class to the html when you're fullscreened
2011-05-14T13:00:16  <Frontier> I don't go to fullscreen by default, but the user may choose to go to fullscreen and then save the setting
2011-05-14T13:00:24  <amstan> yeah.. i know
2011-05-14T13:00:34  <amstan> so.. ignore the setting for autofullscreen on the other pages
2011-05-14T13:01:09  <Frontier> hmmm... checking for a page name somewhere in the code seems ugly.
2011-05-14T13:01:34  <Frontier> I should really get around adding a constructor option :p
2011-05-14T13:01:43  <_flag> were there any major changes to the way the engine does input from say, a month ago until now apart from the 'r' thing? My bot randomly misses food with the newest engine but works perfectly fine with an older one.
2011-05-14T13:01:46  <amstan> yeah, that's what i meant

2011-05-14T17:35:52  <janzert> McLeopold: pong
2011-05-14T17:36:12  <McLeopold> I was thinking about the dir structure of our repo
2011-05-14T17:36:25  <McLeopold> perhaps each game should be a module
2011-05-14T17:36:32  <McLeopold> so I don't have to do this
2011-05-14T17:36:51  <McLeopold> sys.path.append("../ants")
2011-05-14T17:36:51  <McLeopold> from ants import Ants
2011-05-14T17:37:18  <janzert> yeah, I don't much like the cross dependencies between ants and worker
2011-05-14T17:37:33  <McLeopold> I never did either, it was just to get something going
2011-05-14T17:37:55  <janzert> but I'm not sure I'd change it at this point.
2011-05-14T17:38:16  <McLeopold> well, for zeta then
2011-05-14T17:38:47  <janzert> sure :)
2011-05-14T17:39:28  <McLeopold> I think game directories inside the worker may make sense
2011-05-14T17:41:06  <McLeopold> janzert: or both inside the same dir as modules
2011-05-14T17:41:07  <janzert> I think trying to *completely* abstract the server framework from the game is going to far, i.e. it's going to be cleaner and easier for each server setup to be single contest / game specific
2011-05-14T17:41:13  <McLeopold> so every game would be a sibling
2011-05-14T17:41:44  <McLeopold> At some point I thought we'd have a database that could control multiple games at once
2011-05-14T17:42:28  <janzert> yeah, I have mixed thoughts about that is all
2011-05-14T17:42:40  <janzert> from both a code and social perspective
2011-05-14T17:43:11  <McLeopold> From a social perspective, we should only ever have 1 official contest at a time
2011-05-14T17:43:12  <janzert> but I'm not firmly against it either
2011-05-14T17:44:12  <McLeopold> janzert: amstan was saying that acl's would be better than chown on some of the dirs, like uploads and games
2011-05-14T17:46:26  <janzert> what does he want to do with them?
2011-05-14T17:46:57  <janzert> it also means we'll need to be able to mount the partition with them enabled, no idea how easy that is to do with ec2
2011-05-14T17:47:20  <janzert> ACL's give finer control of course but I'm not sure why we need that
2011-05-14T17:48:29  <McLeopold> I'm not familiar with them
2011-05-14T17:49:11  <janzert> yeah, I'm basically familiar with the concept but haven't actually used them "in anger" :)

2011-05-14T18:05:25  <janzert> thinking about it a bit I'm pretty sure any set of permission combination you want to give to 2 separate users + everone else you can do with regular file permissions or ACLs it is only when you have 3 or more users + everone else that you may be forced to use ACLs
2011-05-14T18:05:58  <janzert> so far as I know we only ever have 2 users involved, the contest user and the web server
2011-05-14T18:07:49  <janzert> the only exception I can think of is restricting root from having access, but I'm pretty sure that requires a special kernel build as well
2011-05-14T18:08:17  <janzert> and that also certainly doesn't apply to us
