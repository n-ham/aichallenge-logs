2011-08-28T06:53:32  <Obeleh_> mcstar
2011-08-28T06:53:50  <Obeleh_> Normally if you run play_one_game.cmd
2011-08-28T06:54:40  <Obeleh_> You need some form of executable... Either the javavm or .net exe or whatever..  that runs your but
2011-08-28T06:54:51  <Obeleh_> But with a TCP server you dont have this
2011-08-28T06:56:04  <Obeleh_> But I'm working around it atm.... I'm making an executable that connects to the tcp server and asks the server for the Orders to send to the current game
2011-08-28T07:07:53  <mcstar> Obeleh_: the engine can run anything with an input/output stream
2011-08-28T07:08:22  <mcstar> for example i used standard netcat to interface with the engine my bot over a socket
2011-08-28T07:08:38  <mleise> interesting
2011-08-28T07:09:33  <mcstar> as mcleo previously pointed out the solution lies somewhere in the sandbox
2011-08-28T07:09:52  <mcstar> you bascically need to redirect the sandbox's interface over tcp
2011-08-28T07:10:01  *** Obeleh <Obeleh!541e6ad4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.84.30.106.212> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-28T07:10:08  <mcstar> it like adding a superclass to the sandbox
2011-08-28T07:10:09  <Obeleh> So you would be able to modify it so that it would connect to the tcp server?
2011-08-28T07:10:55  <mcstar> the sandbox basically wouldnt notice that something is different
2011-08-28T07:11:26  *** Obeleh_ <Obeleh_!541e6ad4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.84.30.106.212> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-08-28T07:11:29  <mcstar> obviously i havent looked at the code, im not sure if i will, but the general idea is this
2011-08-28T07:12:58  <mcstar> but the scheduling of games i suppose becomes more difficult to do
2011-08-28T07:13:21  <mcstar> the previous tcp servers solved this, so i guess you should use that solution
2011-08-28T07:13:45  <mcstar> and rewrite the engine for this to work togther
2011-08-28T07:13:46  <mcstar> e
2011-08-28T07:14:03  <mleise> hey if you write mcleo, I'll write McStarwars
2011-08-28T07:14:25  <mcstar> who is he?
2011-08-28T07:14:48  <mleise> you, because star ist just a short form, right
2011-08-28T07:14:58  <mcstar> pfff
2011-08-28T07:15:07  <mcstar> whats the problem with mcleo?
2011-08-28T07:15:23  <mcstar> im asking you ml.
2011-08-28T07:16:22  <mcstar> mleise:
2011-08-28T07:17:10  <mleise> nothing, I'm just trolling with success
2011-08-28T07:17:37  <mcstar> my dog died today
2011-08-28T07:17:43  <mcstar> one of them
2011-08-28T07:17:44  <Obeleh> mcstar I dont know how to do it in Python so Im going with what I have atm and if someone wants to edit the engine so that it can connect to a tcp server that would be nice :)
2011-08-28T07:18:00  <Obeleh> im sorry to hear that
2011-08-28T07:18:06  <mcstar> dont be, im not
2011-08-28T07:18:12  <mleise> mcstar: oh I'm sorry. I know how I missed our dog when he died early this year :-/
2011-08-28T07:18:23  <mcstar> yeah, im just pissed
2011-08-28T07:18:44  <mcstar> neigboring dogs are tearing apart our fences
2011-08-28T07:19:13  <mcstar> and yesterday night there was some fight, i found dead the female dog in the morning
2011-08-28T07:19:45  <mcstar> i was hunting a big dobberman(?) for a couple of days for now
2011-08-28T07:19:57  <mleise> wow, these neighboring dogs are really aggressive
2011-08-28T07:20:09  <mcstar> i hit him a couple of times with an air-rifle, but he still comes back
2011-08-28T07:20:17  <mleise> Oo
2011-08-28T07:20:54  <mcstar> the male dog's teeth-line was quite bloody, i had to wash him
2011-08-28T07:20:59  <mcstar> (our dog's)
2011-08-28T07:21:04  <mleise> that dog is a danger for the society. it needs to be ... you know ... put to a long sleep
2011-08-28T07:21:37  <mcstar> yeah, working on it, causes trouble for a couple of our neigbors too, but its owner just wouldnt lock him up, sob
2011-08-28T07:21:46  <mleise> or maybe actually the owner doesn't care for that dog
2011-08-28T07:22:09  <mcstar> the owner is kind of an ahole
2011-08-28T07:22:20  <mcstar> back to tcp
2011-08-28T07:22:37  <mcstar> Obeleh: so what are you exactly trying to do?
2011-08-28T07:22:50  <mcstar> if you dont do python, what do you do?
2011-08-28T07:23:01  <mcstar> i mean the whole framework is in python
2011-08-28T07:23:53  <Obeleh> Im making a dummy Executable that connects to the TCP server... And eventually write all commands it gets from the tcp server to the commandline
2011-08-28T07:23:56  <mcstar> you will probably invest time in this, maybe a lot, do it the right way, so that people will really be able to use what you did
2011-08-28T07:24:03  <Obeleh> It uses the tcp server for input
2011-08-28T07:24:04  <mcstar> make it fit with the current tools
2011-08-28T07:24:35  <mcstar> hm
2011-08-28T07:24:56  <mcstar> you basically write a socket/stdio pipe?
2011-08-28T07:25:10  <mcstar> in most languges thats 2 line sof code
2011-08-28T07:25:27  <Obeleh> I guess
2011-08-28T07:25:32  <mcstar> but does this solve the problem?
2011-08-28T07:25:53  <mcstar> i really think you would need to tweak the engine/sanbox
2011-08-28T07:26:10  <mcstar> and interface that with the already done web interface
2011-08-28T07:26:21  <Obeleh> In pseudo code:
2011-08-28T07:26:33  <Obeleh> TCP server matches up a match..
2011-08-28T07:28:07  <Obeleh> RunCmd "playonegame -rounds 1000 -roundtime 1000 -map somemap.txt "tcprunner1.exe -s localhost - p 3000 -uid 123" "tcprunner1.exe -s localhost - p 3000 -uid 456"
2011-08-28T07:28:29  <mleise> If you need me to do anything for that on the visualizer side just call. A tcp server is important.
2011-08-28T07:28:38  <Obeleh> so the tcp runners will connect to the tcp server aswell and forward evertthing
2011-08-28T07:29:00  <Obeleh> Sure thnx
2011-08-28T07:30:16  <mcstar> my view: use the available framework, BUT use a connection pool, i.e. match up players like the beta server does, but only those players, that are connection to the server at that time
2011-08-28T07:30:34  <mcstar> connection->connected
2011-08-28T07:31:21  <mcstar> so the tcp server would look exactly like the beta server now
2011-08-28T07:31:45  <mcstar> but instead of choosing players from the registered users, it would choose from the connected onesű
2011-08-28T07:32:49  <mcstar> i dont see a step in your solution
2011-08-28T07:33:12  <mcstar> you suppose, that already, the correct number of players are already connected
2011-08-28T07:33:22  <mcstar> and how do you indentify them?
2011-08-28T07:33:37  <mcstar> thats too fragile
2011-08-28T07:34:05  <mcstar> its not like the server connects to their pc's
2011-08-28T07:34:14  <Obeleh> nono
2011-08-28T07:34:16  <mcstar> as if there was a service was running on them
2011-08-28T07:34:23  <mcstar> that would be easy
2011-08-28T07:34:35  <Obeleh> I know it has to wait until it has enough players
2011-08-28T07:34:35  <mcstar> but it would be another complication for them
2011-08-28T07:35:03  <mcstar> Obeleh: this COULD work, if you are there, watching it, but i dont see this solution gets automated
2011-08-28T07:35:47  <mcstar> i dont want to discourage you, and please, hear out a second/third opinion too, but you should really think from the engine's side
2011-08-28T07:35:53  <mcstar> and solve the problem from there
2011-08-28T07:36:19  <mcstar> dont add an itnermediate layer
2011-08-28T07:36:41  <Obeleh> I want to temporarily build it and ask someone to do the same thing in python
2011-08-28T07:37:04  <mcstar> so, why dont you do it in python already, without this wrapper?
2011-08-28T07:37:12  <Obeleh> I simply wouldnt know where to start in the current engine
2011-08-28T07:37:31  <mcstar> yeah, you need to read the code, and figure it out
2011-08-28T07:37:52  <mcstar> i mean, probably this is the reason noone has written a correct tcp server before
2011-08-28T07:38:07  <mcstar> because only 2-3 people are very familiar with the engine
2011-08-28T07:38:14  <mcstar> mleise: maybe only 1? mcleo?
2011-08-28T07:39:09  <Obeleh> If im going to do it in the engine that would double the complexity I think. And I want to get something to work first... And then add complexity
2011-08-28T07:40:32  <Obeleh> But you would want to write the entire TCP server in Python you mean?
2011-08-28T07:40:42  <mcstar> Obeleh: ok, sure, but at least as around, for exmaple talk to delt0r_ he was doing this yesterday, probably even today, coordinate your efforts
2011-08-28T07:40:50  <mcstar> sure
2011-08-28T07:40:52  <Obeleh> not just the hooking up part where the clients get hooked up to the TCP server
2011-08-28T07:41:06  <mcstar> that for sure
2011-08-28T07:41:22  <mcstar> but i take it there are good tcp servers in python
2011-08-28T07:41:32  <mcstar> super-easy to use

2011-08-28T08:01:45  <mleise> In a big company this situation would be horrible. At least two people need to know the code.
