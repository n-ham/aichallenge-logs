2011-07-01T03:52:11  <antimatroid> do i just add them and they get emailed an invite?
2011-07-01T03:52:18  <bhasker> normally yes
2011-07-01T03:52:25  <bhasker> but google has blocked that route for now due to too muc demand
2011-07-01T03:52:29  <bhasker> but they didn't close all the loops
2011-07-01T03:52:38  <bhasker> so the way is a bit convuluted
2011-07-01T03:52:43  *** okay is now known as okayzed
2011-07-01T03:52:48  <bhasker> you create a circle, add the person you want to invite to that circle
2011-07-01T03:53:00  <bhasker> then share a post with that circle and make sure you click "Share via email"
2011-07-01T03:53:11  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-07-01T03:53:16  <antimatroid> cheers
2011-07-01T03:53:20  <bhasker> the person will get an email with your post alongwith a button "Click here Learn more about google+"
2011-07-01T03:53:38  <bhasker> if he follows the button it directly takes the person to a page to create his profile and get into google+
2011-07-01T03:53:51  <bhasker> currently that is the only way to get in as far as i know
2011-07-01T03:54:10  <bhasker> so once you are done sending that, remove him from the circle and add him to the one you want him in
2011-07-01T03:54:14  <bhasker> rinse repeat:)
2011-07-01T03:54:25  <bhasker> just add everyone you want to invite in one shot to a circle
2011-07-01T03:54:28  <bhasker> and send one message
2011-07-01T03:54:35  <bhasker> via email
2011-07-01T03:55:22  <antimatroid> yep cool
2011-07-01T03:55:28  <antimatroid> i'm just doing it for my brother
2011-07-01T03:55:47  <antimatroid> it will get him brownie points at work being on top of that stuff
2011-07-01T03:59:00  <bhasker> haha:)
2011-07-01T03:59:04  <antimatroid> i wonder how much facebook are pooping themsevles atm
2011-07-01T03:59:11  <bhasker> quite a lot i imagine
2011-07-01T03:59:18  <bhasker> though a few things that are missing yet
2011-07-01T03:59:23  <bhasker> no app platform for + yet
2011-07-01T03:59:33  <bhasker> but otoh,
2011-07-01T03:59:41  <bhasker> huddle+ hangouts are awesome
2011-07-01T03:59:52  <bhasker> 10 way video conferencing
2011-07-01T04:00:01  <bhasker> and group messaging which is easy to do
2011-07-01T04:00:14  <bhasker> oh and the privacy settings are much more easier to manage
2011-07-01T04:01:36  <antimatroid> yep
2011-07-01T04:01:53  <antimatroid> if the market tips towards google+ facebook will go the way of myspace

2011-07-01T06:11:09  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: I found that in 2009 in Ukraine was a contest like this one. The game was Bomberman (didn't you played it on NES?). Here is the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKiFb9l6tlU&feature=player_embedded
2011-07-01T06:11:29  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: i'm shaped :(
2011-07-01T06:11:37  <UncleVasya> What do you think about this game? Is it seems interesting for you?
2011-07-01T06:11:53  <antimatroid> i can barely load an image, let alone a video :)

2011-07-01T06:12:13  <antimatroid> there was an ants like contest a few years ago too
2011-07-01T06:12:19  <antimatroid> shaped means i have dial up speeds
2011-07-01T06:12:42  <antimatroid> cause i went over my monthly quota (20gb/month, fml, 1500kbit connection too)
2011-07-01T06:13:14  <UncleVasya> oh, ok. It's not so awful as army :)

2011-07-01T06:13:34  <UncleVasya> I have dial-up all the time, so you are not alone with it.
2011-07-01T06:13:44  <antimatroid> do you get the awesome noise?
2011-07-01T06:14:18  <UncleVasya> no
2011-07-01T06:15:17  <UncleVasya> my dial-up isn't really dial-up. It's a gprs via mobile phone as a modem with ugly speed and quota 20mb/day.

2011-07-01T08:56:51  <mcstar> i was surprised by the amount of nodes it scanned, i looked at the code, and when it selects a new node from the open set it chooses one of the nodes with min(g+h)
2011-07-01T08:57:02  <mcstar> and i thought wth, why not just min(h)?
2011-07-01T08:57:15  <mcstar> and it became much much faster
2011-07-01T08:57:34  <mcstar> but i soon realized that it wont find the optimal path
2011-07-01T08:57:46  <mcstar> but comes close to it in most situations
2011-07-01T08:57:58  <mcstar> but i prepared a test case when it performed pretty poorly
2011-07-01T08:58:19  <mcstar> but in the ants game i will probably use only min(h)
2011-07-01T08:58:30  <antimatroid1> what was the test case?
2011-07-01T08:58:39  <mcstar> ill render it, wait
2011-07-01T08:58:41  <antimatroid1> i'm surprised it makes a difference?
2011-07-01T08:58:49  <mcstar> it does, a huge one
2011-07-01T08:59:16  <mcstar> ill just have to fire up my environment it will take some time
2011-07-01T09:00:18  <tnbd> Is anyone creating a clojure starter pack?
2011-07-01T09:00:59  <antimatroid1> mcstar: have you tried minimising f then h?
2011-07-01T09:01:08  <antimatroid1> so min h if min f is a draw?
2011-07-01T09:02:05  <mcstar> i havent
2011-07-01T09:02:10  <mcstar> but sounds good
2011-07-01T09:02:46  <mcstar> the selection among the minimas are uncontrolled
2011-07-01T09:02:56  <mcstar> is
2011-07-01T09:05:24  <antimatroid1> mcstar: i still haven't been able to work out the comment on wikipedia saying that if the heuristic function isn't monotone then you can't use the open/closed set version
2011-07-01T09:05:41  <antimatroid1> i would have expected that to be the slower one that could be used with monotone fucntions? :\

2011-07-01T09:21:37  <antimatroid1> mcstar: i'd be curious to see a video of, min f, min h, and min f then min h on the same map...
2011-07-01T09:21:53  <antimatroid1> possibly even throw bfs in?
2011-07-01T09:22:05  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-01T09:22:06  <mcstar> no
2011-07-01T09:22:07  <aerique> and weighted a*
2011-07-01T09:22:18  <mcstar> i wont do that sorry
2011-07-01T09:22:23  <mcstar> i mean bfs
2011-07-01T09:22:32  <mcstar> weighted a* is a possibility
2011-07-01T09:22:53  <mcstar> but first ill rewrite it, i dont need to use hashtables
2011-07-01T09:24:57  <mcstar> antimatroid1: so do you have a solution to the multiple-source multiple-target problem?
2011-07-01T09:25:09  <antimatroid1> mcstar: i can do it with a*
2011-07-01T09:25:27  <antimatroid1> the heuristic function isn't really that cheap if you have LOTS of targets though..
2011-07-01T09:25:33  <mcstar> but your in a good position, because you recalculate everything on every turn
2011-07-01T09:26:01  <mcstar> i want a solution which gives whole paths without ants stepping on each other
2011-07-01T09:26:17  <antimatroid1> at any point in the path?
2011-07-01T09:26:18  <antimatroid1> or this turn?
2011-07-01T09:26:22  <antimatroid1> you can do both
2011-07-01T09:26:22  <mcstar> any point
2011-07-01T09:26:33  <mcstar> i figured its a seriously hard problem
2011-07-01T09:26:56  <antimatroid1> just have a set<pair<Location, int> > which indicate the turn a square is taken on
2011-07-01T09:27:14  <antimatroid1> then when you add a square to the search path, g(x) += however long it takes to iterate to a not taken turn for that square
2011-07-01T09:27:39  <antimatroid1> and you update the information for the set every time you select a path
2011-07-01T09:27:48  <antimatroid1> and allow the ants to stand still in their path generation if necessary
2011-07-01T09:28:12  <mcstar> thats cheating
2011-07-01T09:28:18  <antimatroid1> how?
2011-07-01T09:28:41  <mcstar> i guess this doesnt find the globsl minimum
2011-07-01T09:28:44  <mcstar> a
2011-07-01T09:28:57  <mcstar> but yeah, for practical purposes its good
2011-07-01T09:28:58  <antimatroid1> global minimum of what?
2011-07-01T09:29:26  <mcstar> the minimum possible lenght of the sum of all paths
2011-07-01T09:29:34  <antimatroid1> if you want the actual optimum way to collect multiple targets with spawning ants even without enemies, you will need to search the entire tree i think
2011-07-01T09:29:48  <mcstar> but, i should say time, if you let them take a nap
2011-07-01T09:30:11  <antimatroid1> but i think it would work reasonably wel
2011-07-01T09:30:17  <mcstar> i agree
2011-07-01T09:30:25  <antimatroid1>  i can think of a way to store paths too i think
2011-07-01T09:30:48  <antimatroid1> well, that's trivial, but then to only reuse them when they're still optimal without recalculating that path
2011-07-01T09:32:25  <antimatroid1> start with all ants as sources, but take the food you're expecting to collect out of the target set, collect uncollected food, even with ants expected to move, then process the old paths for ants that are still able to move, then collect the food that was expected to be collected but the ant found a different closer food squrae
2011-07-01T09:32:52  <antimatroid1> (also if you're going to collect a food square with an ant expected to collect, make sure the new food item is closer than the old one)
2011-07-01T09:34:39  <mcstar> hell, this always confuses me
2011-07-01T09:34:57  <mcstar> we think different things when we sa "store paths"
2011-07-01T09:35:03  <mcstar> y
2011-07-01T09:35:12  <antimatroid1> i think of a queue of moves
2011-07-01T09:35:35  <antimatroid1> where a move has a start location, end location and direction
2011-07-01T09:35:41  <mcstar> i think if a path, from A to B and cache the path for all time, no recalculation on a turn-by-turn basis
2011-07-01T09:36:01  <mcstar> if->of
2011-07-01T09:36:56  <mcstar> but you only do this, because you cant permanently assign pahts to ants, right?
2011-07-01T09:37:41  <mcstar> hmmm maybe this is the solution: i dont need to store ants permanently
2011-07-01T09:37:55  <mcstar> my abstarction will be based on paths
2011-07-01T09:38:59  <mcstar> you see what i mean? i will make paths permanent, and the ant which happen to be on a path, simply follows that path
2011-07-01T09:39:44  <mcstar> lets call this covariant formalism
2011-07-01T09:41:43  <aerique> mleise: Is it an idea to add buttons for stepping through a move AND attack phase at once to the visualizer?  I don't always need the extra visual info and get tired of clicking twice :-)

2011-07-01T10:35:09  <sir_macelon> i'm seriously starting to think that scoring system is not favouring fights at all, see game: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=49258
2011-07-01T10:36:33  <sir_macelon> during all game I'm chasing his ants and killing them off, he only runs away trying to collect food luckily spawned, and yet the score is more or less even
2011-07-01T10:37:00  <sir_macelon> favouring the runaway tactics
2011-07-01T10:37:27  <sir_macelon> shouldn't the scoring system encourage to engage into battles to win the game?
2011-07-01T10:37:46  <sir_macelon> i.e. 2 points instead of 1 for killing an ant
2011-07-01T10:39:31  <mleise> sir_macelon: you are tracking food that is out of sight, very nice :)
2011-07-01T10:40:54  <sir_macelon> mleise: had to do it after the 'r' part was removed, i thought every body has done that, it's not that hard :)
2011-07-01T10:42:22  <sir_macelon> mleise: by the way are there any other stats available than just ant count and score? i.e. killed enemy ants?
2011-07-01T10:42:39  <mleise> unfortunatly no

2011-07-01T10:50:22  <sir_macelon> i believe these kind of stats would help to see if scroing is fair for fighting bots
2011-07-01T11:00:29  <mleise> oh i need to write more unit tests :-/
2011-07-01T11:01:55  <mleise> sir_macelon: You were losing the game by numbers. I think the other bot won fair by collecting more food. :)
2011-07-01T11:04:45  <sir_macelon> mleise: if you take a look at the first 300 turns, you'll notice I have killed many of his ants, while he was avoiding the fight and focus only on food collection, should the scoring encourage such behaviour?
2011-07-01T11:05:16  <sir_macelon> mleise: and the score during those first 300 turns, was almost identical
2011-07-01T11:05:49  <sir_macelon> mleise: which doesn't sound fair for me, taking into account the strategy used by both bots
2011-07-01T11:06:36  <mleise> Hmm, I don't have a strong opinion on that. Maybe antimatroid1 or antimatroid-uni knows more about the intentions :)

2011-07-01T13:05:50  <eashoka> can any one show some light on this. I just updated a new version of my bot. in my profile page, it clearly says I have won the first game with 7 players but has given no ratings points for that. it shows just 0.0 for that game. should I log this as a defect in the system or am I missing something. you can view this wierd looking result at http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=264 Tx in advance!
2011-07-01T13:07:32  <McLeopold> eashoka: do you have a screen shot of the page?  it has updated
2011-07-01T13:07:42  <eashoka> look at the result line for the first game for version 6. Is that normal .. has it happened to any of you as well ?
2011-07-01T13:08:03  <McLeopold> oh
2011-07-01T13:08:04  <McLeopold> ...
2011-07-01T13:08:41  <eashoka> it's still there. can u see it ?
2011-07-01T13:08:44  <McLeopold> y
2011-07-01T13:12:08  <McLeopold> eashoka: the database has nulls for that game, which means the trueskill code probably crashed
2011-07-01T13:12:38  <McLeopold> we already have an open issue on that
2011-07-01T13:12:48  <eashoka> oh. ok, tx for info. :-)
2011-07-01T13:13:27  <McLeopold> 965 records are like that, meaning that many players didn't get credit for their games
2011-07-01T13:15:06  <eashoka> also, in yesterday when I updated, it greyed out my last position in the ranking list. however, instead of greying out the most recent ranking. it has greyed out the last ranking of a very old version. that issue is now fixed I think.
2011-07-01T13:16:10  <McLeopold> eashoka: if you see an old submission ranked lower than your current, that is a problem
2011-07-01T13:16:22  <eashoka> u know, instead of greying out the last rating of version n-1, it has chosen to grey our version n-3 or something. just FYI
2011-07-01T13:16:45  <McLeopold> yeah, that would be okay, as long as the old submission is ranked higher than the current
2011-07-01T13:17:06  <eashoka> nope it was ranked lower than my currrent at the time.
2011-07-01T13:17:28  <McLeopold> do you remember the time you saw that?
2011-07-01T13:19:04  <eashoka> think 2011-06-29 03 am like
2011-07-01T13:20:21  <McLeopold> eashoka: what's your timezone? or what was GMT at that time?
2011-07-01T13:21:12  <eashoka> actually it happened to a friend of mine. I saw it. we thought of reporting at the time but wasn't sure ... time zone is GMT +530 but the time I have given you is as the server reported it
2011-07-01T13:21:37  <McLeopold> ok
2011-07-01T13:22:53  <eashoka> after a while, the server didn't displayed a greyed line at all (even though his latest bot was still so far down), then from next update onwards it all worked fine, so we thought the issue was now fixed. :-)
2011-07-01T13:23:04  <McLeopold> no
2011-07-01T13:23:19  <McLeopold> There are a few criteria for showing old submissions
2011-07-01T13:23:31  <McLeopold> After 48 hours, it will never show
2011-07-01T13:23:51  <McLeopold> but if an old submission has played a game in the last 48 hours, there still might be an issue
2011-07-01T13:23:55  <eashoka> ah no, it dissapeared just after few hours

2011-07-01T13:24:58  <eashoka> since the line which got dissapeared was a wrong line (from a lower rank older version) anyway we thought it's acceptable at the time :-)

2011-07-01T14:06:02  <antimatroid1> yeah, i still think it's worth giving people something for spawning though
2011-07-01T14:06:13  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: a month ago we discussed and added scoring for spawns, so that there would be even climbing in the ranks
2011-07-01T14:06:42  <McLeopold> before, fighting was the only thing to give you points
2011-07-01T14:06:55  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-07-01T14:07:05  <antimatroid1> that's why i'm saying i still like giving people something for spawning ants
2011-07-01T14:07:17  <McLeopold> I think 1:2 ratio is good
2011-07-01T14:07:17  <antimatroid1> but is it too much relative to what fighting/killing enemies is worth?
2011-07-01T14:08:17  <McLeopold> if the enemy blocks, and you have more territory, what should you do?
2011-07-01T14:08:37  <antimatroid1> sit a few ants at the blockade to make sure they don't come through

2011-07-01T14:08:58  <antimatroid1> i'm hoping with my maze maps, there shouldn't be any blockable regions
2011-07-01T14:09:04  <antimatroid1> only the option of having decent defense
2011-07-01T14:09:13  <McLeopold> Did you see my code for testing unblockable?
2011-07-01T14:09:19  <antimatroid1> no?
2011-07-01T14:09:34  <antimatroid1> what does it do? my maps can't all be traversed by a 2x2 block
2011-07-01T14:09:48  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/map.py
2011-07-01T14:10:14  <McLeopold> at the bottom, the allowable function
2011-07-01T14:10:17  <McLeopold> or method
2011-07-01T14:10:37  <McLeopold> I'm thinking that will be the official test of acceptable maps
2011-07-01T14:10:52  <McLeopold> I still need to add average distance between ants
2011-07-01T14:11:00  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: you've seen some of my maze maps yeah?

2011-07-01T14:11:42  <antimatroid1> i carve a 3x3 (or larger) block maze out, then from the walls of that I randomly strip water out so the walls aren't all smooth, but a 3x3 block can't reach into all the cut outs on the walls then
2011-07-01T14:11:47  <antimatroid1> is that going to still be valid?
2011-07-01T14:12:19  <McLeopold> yes
2011-07-01T14:12:21  <antimatroid1> oh, i suspect yes?
2011-07-01T14:12:23  <antimatroid1> yep cool
2011-07-01T14:12:46  <McLeopold> 66 percent of the map must be "seen" by a 3x3 block traversing the map
2011-07-01T14:13:06  <antimatroid1> "# make sure the map has more columns than rows" :) i think my mapgen does this now
2011-07-01T14:13:06  <McLeopold> so spots next to spots that can be traversed count
2011-07-01T14:13:15  <antimatroid1> i'll make sure of it later some time
2011-07-01T14:13:31  <McLeopold> This is a class you can inherit from to make you map gen code smarter
2011-07-01T14:13:37  <McLeopold> fill_small_areas is nice
2011-07-01T14:13:51  <antimatroid1> i would be inclined to make it that the 3x3 block can traverse 66% of the land squares
2011-07-01T14:13:53  <antimatroid1> not just see them
2011-07-01T14:14:40  <antimatroid1> or is that what you meant?
2011-07-01T14:14:46  <McLeopold> it's close
2011-07-01T14:15:13  <McLeopold> basically the "seen" stuff includes an outline around the traversable area
2011-07-01T14:15:29  <McLeopold> the stuff that is 1 move away from unblockable sections
2011-07-01T14:15:35  <antimatroid1> ah yep, okay
2011-07-01T14:15:54  <antimatroid1> so it will see 100% of my maps as not blockable?
2011-07-01T14:16:01  <McLeopold> probably
2011-07-01T14:16:08  <antimatroid1> that's cool
2011-07-01T14:16:22  <antimatroid1> i wasn't sure how to do mine with 100% check, but that'd do it
2011-07-01T14:16:46  <McLeopold> also, the get_random_option can be used to standardize map options
2011-07-01T14:17:08  <antimatroid1> i need to work out with carlop what the hell he is doing at some point
2011-07-01T14:17:17  <McLeopold> is he doing something?
2011-07-01T14:17:23  <antimatroid1> i think it's worth generalising my map stuff to what he was doing with symmetries
2011-07-01T14:17:48  <McLeopold> It could go in the Map class if it can be reused
2011-07-01T14:18:14  <McLeopold> I'm making a "tile" method right now
2011-07-01T14:18:14  <antimatroid1> it's for constructing symmetric grids and the function to get symmetric locations for a given one
2011-07-01T14:18:28  <antimatroid1> i think he's generalised it so it can all go in one place
2011-07-01T14:18:35  <antimatroid1> it looks a bit messy though
2011-07-01T14:18:36  <McLeopold> I've got the get_symmetric stuff already written
2011-07-01T14:18:59  <antimatroid1> is it all in the one function? tile, rotational, etc.?
2011-07-01T14:19:06  <antimatroid1> carlop had more symmetries too
2011-07-01T14:19:18  <antimatroid1> by taking like 2 player rotational then rotating that around 4 times
2011-07-01T14:19:19  <McLeopold> my get_symmetric can detect all symmetries
2011-07-01T14:19:53  <McLeopold> the only hard part is shearing
2011-07-01T14:20:12  <antimatroid1> is that where they meet up in the middle?
2011-07-01T14:20:19  <antimatroid1> and more than one player shares the same symmetric square?
2011-07-01T14:20:27  <antimatroid1> i hate that spot of the map, it's a real pita
2011-07-01T14:20:31  <McLeopold> no, that's where the tiles aren't meant to be in a grid, like your original maps
2011-07-01T14:20:46  <McLeopold> so, the left edge doesn't match the right edge
2011-07-01T14:20:57  <McLeopold> but it is meant to be shifted up or down
2011-07-01T14:21:24  <antimatroid1> oh, could you do it easier with the row and column translate information?
2011-07-01T14:21:30  <antimatroid1> you can work that out from the map information easily
2011-07-01T14:21:37  <antimatroid1> actually, i doubt it
2011-07-01T14:21:39  <McLeopold> it depends on the map generation method
2011-07-01T14:21:45  <McLeopold> for random walk, it's easy
2011-07-01T14:22:14  <McLeopold> maybe a generic function that when you wrap left, right, top or bottom, it does the shift for you?
2011-07-01T14:23:00  <antimatroid1> like when you ask for the north location at the top of the map?
2011-07-01T14:23:18  <McLeopold> right, you wrap, end up at the bottom, but it shifted you the c_trans amount
2011-07-01T14:23:23  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-07-01T14:23:25  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2011-07-01T14:24:36  <antimatroid1> tile symmetry isn't my favourite looking, but i still think it's by far the coolest symmetry method :P
2011-07-01T14:24:54  <antimatroid1> particularly as it can do any number of players
2011-07-01T14:26:23  <McLeopold> yeah, that's a nice feature
2011-07-01T14:26:42  <McLeopold> plus you don't have to worry about starting distances too much
2011-07-01T14:27:21  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: are you sure it doesn't already wrap nicely by way of having to tile?

2011-07-01T14:27:47  <McLeopold> what doesn't tile?
2011-07-01T14:28:26  <antimatroid1> maybe i'm confused, when you go off the edge of a tile map, didn't you want to come back in on the sort of same place symmetrically?
2011-07-01T14:28:45  <antimatroid1> like if you had done the same move at a symmetrically equivalent location not on the border?
2011-07-01T14:28:52  <antimatroid1> you'd get the symmetrically equivalent locations back
2011-07-01T14:29:09  <McLeopold> yeah, but it depends on if your tiles are meant to shift or not
2011-07-01T14:29:23  <antimatroid1> what do you mean by shift?
2011-07-01T14:29:23  <McLeopold> shift may be 0
2011-07-01T14:29:32  <McLeopold> I need to draw a picture...
2011-07-01T14:29:57  <antimatroid1> i think the shift is always 0 for tile maps though?

2011-07-01T14:33:42  <antimatroid1> i'm downloading java
2011-07-01T14:34:06  <McLeopold> your symmetric maps can be sliced either horizontally or vertically, which maze an long strip that is tiled, but shifted
2011-07-01T14:34:16  <McLeopold> /maze/makes/
2011-07-01T14:34:57  <McLeopold> so, you only need to have either row_trans, or col_trans, but not both
2011-07-01T14:35:20  <McLeopold> then, build one tile, the duplicate
2011-07-01T14:35:27  <McLeopold> no mirroring allowed
2011-07-01T14:35:40  <McLeopold> or at least not in that direction
2011-07-01T14:37:13  <McLeopold> I suppose you could mirror once in the other direction
2011-07-01T14:37:29  <McLeopold> but then you need to check starting distances again

2011-07-01T14:52:18  <antimatroid1> it is inconvenient though, as you can't index say a matrix<bool> as m[location]
2011-07-01T14:52:26  <antimatroid1> it just doesn't work :(
2011-07-01T14:52:55  <mleise> look, for that to work the booleans must at least be byte size, so why not use bytes in the first place?
2011-07-01T14:53:27  <antimatroid1> meh, i've just used m[location.row][location.col] for those now

2011-07-01T15:00:36  <antimatroid1> even then i'm not sure i actually need to
2011-07-01T15:00:53  <antimatroid1> and for my bug thing in struct for all the game states in nodes
2011-07-01T15:01:18  <antimatroid1> /s/struct/state
2011-07-01T15:01:57  <antimatroid1> if you're not changing it, const struct &s is even faster
2011-07-01T15:02:37  <antimatroid1> and sort of forces you not to change it, which can be a good thing too

2011-07-01T16:09:33  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: If I wnat to calculate enemy attach radius as Cells_they_are_attacking_now + Cells_that_they_can_attack_on_the_next_turn
2011-07-01T16:09:39  <UncleVasya> *whant
2011-07-01T16:10:36  <UncleVasya> i need to get from the realr attackradius2 extended one that covers all these cells.
2011-07-01T16:11:22  <UncleVasya> Is    sqr(sqrt(attackradius2) + 1)  a correct formula?
2011-07-01T16:11:31  <antimatroid1> i dunnon about that
2011-07-01T16:11:52  <antimatroid1> i'd generate the attack2 set of locations and then any that you can move to from there
2011-07-01T16:12:05  <antimatroid1> you can use your start up time to generate the set of translation values for this set
2011-07-01T16:12:19  <antimatroid1> then just have a function to return a set of "attack" squares for you
2011-07-01T16:16:53  <UncleVasya> Something like  All  [3;3] attackers = [3;3] attackers + [2;3] attackers + [3;2] attackers + [3;4] attackers + [4;3] attackers  ?
2011-07-01T16:18:26  <antimatroid1> i would have a function get_translate_loc(location, translate_amounts)
2011-07-01T16:19:02  <antimatroid1> then i would have a vector attack_translate_amounts, which would be like {[0,0], [0,1], [attack2+1, attack2] etc}
2011-07-01T16:19:31  <UncleVasya> Can't understand, sorry. It's not because of language :)
2011-07-01T16:19:42  <antimatroid1> then a function, get_attack_locs(location), which would get the translate locs using attack_translate_amounts (which i'd generate during turn 0) and return the vector of battle locations
2011-07-01T16:20:02  <antimatroid1> hang on, let me pseudo code on pastebin
2011-07-01T16:20:21  <UncleVasya> No, don't waste a time.
2011-07-01T16:20:43  <UncleVasya> With my current knowledge I'm not able to unerstand.
2011-07-01T16:21:43  <UncleVasya> With my current brain I came up with those 2 ideas. Second one is easy while first seems to be more elegant to me.
2011-07-01T16:22:43  <UncleVasya> So is it difficult to calculate extended attackradius2 from normal attackradius2?
2011-07-01T16:24:47  <antimatroid1> UncleVasya: http://pastebin.com/GzCmtyjC that's how i plan to do it
2011-07-01T16:25:22  <antimatroid1> what language are you using?
2011-07-01T16:25:32  <UncleVasya> OCaml
2011-07-01T16:25:44  <antimatroid1> depending on how it evaluates say -2%5, you may need to write a different mod function
2011-07-01T16:25:52  <antimatroid1> python is fine as is for example, c++ isn't

2011-07-01T16:28:50  <antimatroid1> mcstar: ?
2011-07-01T16:29:02  <mcstar> im quoting UncleVasya
2011-07-01T16:30:28  <mcstar> (yeah, sure honey, i just run down to the grocery, and since im there, ill probably pick up a new brain for you, what did you say, what is your favourite?)
2011-07-01T16:31:26  <antimatroid1> i thought god was asking about thick shakes when he asked about brain size and i asked for super thick :)
2011-07-01T16:32:06  <mcstar> means super creamy?
2011-07-01T16:32:34  <mcstar> i guess thats good choice for brains too
2011-07-01T16:32:44  <mcstar> its made of much fat as far as i know(brain)
2011-07-01T16:32:53  <antimatroid1> creamy?
2011-07-01T16:32:58  <antimatroid1> a thick shake doesn't have cream :\
2011-07-01T16:33:07  <mcstar> then wtf does it have?
2011-07-01T16:33:27  <antimatroid1> essential ingredients of a thick shake: milo, milk, milo, ice cream and milo
2011-07-01T16:33:33  <antimatroid1> all blended of course
2011-07-01T16:33:39  <mcstar> i only had mcdonalds kind of shakes(yeah, thats not creamy, but there can be creamy shakes)
2011-07-01T16:33:59  <mcstar> did you mention milo? it needs milo too
2011-07-01T16:34:05  <mcstar> and some more milo right?
2011-07-01T16:34:17  <antimatroid1> i cannot understate how important milo is
2011-07-01T16:34:39  <mcstar> yeah, some countries wage war on milo
2011-07-01T16:35:21  <mcstar> i didnt understand UncleVasya's double squareroot
2011-07-01T16:35:56  <mcstar> is hea asking for a function to get all the squares within the attackrad + 1?
2011-07-01T16:36:31  <antimatroid1> i think he wants a "radius" that gives the squares within range of it to be the same set of squares that an enemy ant can battle in the next turn
2011-07-01T16:36:57  <antimatroid1> UnvleVasya: another problem is the fact that one of the enemy ants adjacent squares might be water, limiting where they can actually battle next turn
2011-07-01T16:37:42  <UncleVasya> I have few days left so my goal is just to implement something that looks like a battle :)
2011-07-01T16:37:45  <mcstar> ah, the union of all the basic set translated N,S,E,W?
2011-07-01T16:37:56  <antimatroid1> mcstar: yep
2011-07-01T16:38:19  <antimatroid1> i'd probably try to get the union of the set of adjacent land squares like that
2011-07-01T16:38:23  <UncleVasya> Staff like spectacle for coming into the battle was cuted.
2011-07-01T16:38:51  <mcstar> UncleVasya: just program up a little script which drives an inequality, get the unique elements(through a dictionary for example) and use those indices(save them in a function)
2011-07-01T16:39:45  <UncleVasya> It is a solution that I will implement if the first way is hard.
2011-07-01T16:40:07  <mleise> We don't have 'r' lines any more, right?
2011-07-01T16:40:48  <antimatroid1> mleise: nope, but it's fairly easy to do yourself
2011-07-01T16:41:19  <antimatroid1> when you "clear" food information, make a copy of it first, then once you update vision information, iterate through the old food information and readd the food for a not currently visible square
2011-07-01T16:41:20  <mleise> antimatroid1: it's ok, i was just wondering why i still have it in my parser and it is on the wiki page
2011-07-01T16:41:26  <antimatroid1> ah okay :)
2011-07-01T16:41:32  <UncleVasya> " a little script which drives an inequality, get the unique elements"  -  I have a very similar staff in another part of my bot  so this time it is good to get something new, something more mathematician :)
2011-07-01T16:41:57  <mleise> yes, it is better to create lists of added and removed food I guess
2011-07-01T16:42:24  <antimatroid1> i use sets for ants/food etc.
2011-07-01T16:42:34  <UncleVasya> mcstar: so the formula above is incorrect?
2011-07-01T16:42:36  <antimatroid1> so i can just remove stuff once i've used it and don't want to use it again
2011-07-01T16:42:54  <antimatroid1> derp, that might be causing my bot some huge problems
2011-07-01T16:42:58  <mcstar> http://pastebin.com/4dmdZtaG take a look at this, just to inspire you :)
2011-07-01T16:43:19  <antimatroid1> mcstar: wtf :| :P
2011-07-01T16:43:20  <mcstar> i generated the indices in mathematica, and a 2-liner parser code spit out lisp
2011-07-01T16:43:29  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-01T16:44:04  <mleise> wtf, was what i wanted to say. that's something for a loop :)
2011-07-01T16:44:07  <mcstar> the longest function is to retrieve elements of the board in the original viewradius
2011-07-01T16:44:15  <mcstar> no
2011-07-01T16:44:21  <mcstar> no need for a loop :)
2011-07-01T16:45:09  <mcstar> i dont want to spin up a nested loop every time i want to retrieve those elements
2011-07-01T16:45:15  <mleise> it isn't dynamic, a lot of code, ... generate that stuff in a loop and cache it :)
2011-07-01T16:45:35  <mcstar> its dynamic, i scripted it, copy + paste
2011-07-01T16:46:06  <antimatroid1> mleise: i assume you were referring to the bot input wiki page?
2011-07-01T16:46:07  <mleise> so what if the map size is 165x165?

2011-07-01T16:50:01  <mcstar> i could write it with a macro, which expands to this code before runtime

2011-07-01T16:55:08  <mcstar> why static array? pointer dereference? irc tweeted? still, why the static size?
2011-07-01T16:55:09  <mleise> A dynamic array is a pointer to the dynamic memory block whereas a static array is like an integer, boolean or other 'immediate' variable
2011-07-01T16:55:57  <mcstar> dynamic vs static: dynamic can be anywhere, static is on the function's heap
2011-07-01T16:56:03  <antimatroid1> so a dynamic array is like memory spread out with references to all of it? whereas a normal variable will get a fixed size block?
2011-07-01T16:56:15  <mcstar> doesnt matter if we access them by poiinters or not
2011-07-01T16:56:20  * antimatroid1 doesn't even know what a heap is properly, goes to wikipedia
2011-07-01T16:56:50  <mcstar> a place in memory reserved for a functions local variables
2011-07-01T16:56:51  <mleise> a function's heap?
2011-07-01T16:56:54  <mleise> is that a stack?
2011-07-01T16:56:55  <antimatroid1> oh, okay
2011-07-01T16:57:28  <mcstar> i think stack has access rules
2011-07-01T16:57:39  <mleise> not really, no
2011-07-01T16:57:48  <mleise> stack corruption is common
2011-07-01T16:57:52  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-01T16:58:24  <mleise> At least on x86 when you have a typical function call it puts the return address on the stack + enough memory to hold the function local variables
2011-07-01T16:59:11  <mcstar> ok, i mean there are fifos lifos wtf-foos, which all have access rules, obviously as their names suggest, so in this sense a heap or stack has those rules too
2011-07-01T16:59:23  <mcstar> but it doesnt matter in the previous sense i was using it
2011-07-01T16:59:35  <mcstar> its just a place allocated for a function
2011-07-01T16:59:48  <mcstar> funciton call actually
2011-07-01T17:00:10  <mleise> ok, so If I had a static array there in my function it would eat up stack space
2011-07-01T17:00:31  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-01T17:00:33  <mleise> a dynamic array would only eat up space for a pointer to the real data on the heap
2011-07-01T17:00:41  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-01T17:00:49  <mcstar> as far as i know yes
2011-07-01T17:00:51  <mleise> so a static array is faster :)
2011-07-01T17:00:56  <mcstar> why?
2011-07-01T17:01:08  <mcstar> not on today's processors
2011-07-01T17:01:15  <mleise> because all it requires is stack pointer += array size
2011-07-01T17:01:22  <mcstar> so?

2011-07-01T17:03:19  <mleise> if you do that static and dynamic are pretty much the same
2011-07-01T17:03:49  <mcstar> i dont know D, but there must be a limit to heap size right?

2011-07-01T17:05:04  <UncleVasya> 
2011-07-01T17:05:04  <UncleVasya> : sqr((2.236068) + 1) = 10.472136)
2011-07-01T17:05:20  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-01T17:05:38  <mleise> stack size is limited, but the heap can go anywhere
2011-07-01T17:06:04  <mleise> the operating system sets up an initial stack size which may grow depending on the OS
2011-07-01T17:06:55  <UncleVasya> is it seems to be an ok extended radius2 that covers possible to attack cells too?
2011-07-01T17:06:57  <mcstar> my experience says in c a couple thousand long integer array cannot be statically allocated
2011-07-01T17:07:04  <mleise> mcstar: I have all my large arrays in objects anyway so since these are generated in heap memory they never take up stack space
2011-07-01T17:07:47  <mleise> I'm a typical object-oriented programmer :p
2011-07-01T17:08:37  <mcstar> I'm tyically an object! said the oriented programmer.
2011-07-01T17:08:50  <mleise> hmm the wikipedia page on dynamic array turns me down on my static array approach
2011-07-01T17:09:06  <mcstar> im glad :)
2011-07-01T17:09:25  <mleise> mcstar: you remind me of a java teacher who used to say "everything is an object"
2011-07-01T17:09:51  <mleise> and then he often asked "what is an object" and the answer was not "everything"
2011-07-01T17:09:51  <mcstar> Objection!
2011-07-01T17:10:14  <mcstar> i never had the pleasure of being taught java
2011-07-01T17:10:41  <mleise> at least you deem it a pleasure
2011-07-01T17:11:10  <mcstar> no, its like deceleration is acceleration too
2011-07-01T17:11:19  <mcstar> bad is - good
2011-07-01T17:11:53  <mleise> ah i knew there was a catch
2011-07-01T17:12:03  <mcstar> i really dont know java, other than it runs in a jvm, and hyped, and has curly braces
2011-07-01T17:13:04  <mcstar> UncleVasya: sqrt(attackrad^2)+1 is your new radius
2011-07-01T17:13:25  <mcstar> this will cover all the translated positions
2011-07-01T17:13:52  <mcstar> your last equation above: you really lost me there again
2011-07-01T17:14:15  <mcstar> that equation doesnt make sense from a programmer's or mathematician's viewopoint either
2011-07-01T17:15:42  <UncleVasya> it's because my starter pack comparing squared distance to squared radius to determine is it a good cell:
2011-07-01T17:16:21  <UncleVasya> if distance2 cell ant <= attackradius2 then cell is in the attack radius.
2011-07-01T17:16:27  <mcstar> 2.236068+1 is closer to 3.23 than to 10
2011-07-01T17:16:59  <UncleVasya> I tried to replace it with just  if distance cell ant <= attackradiusthen...  but it gave me a wrong answer.
2011-07-01T17:17:16  <carlop> UncleVasya: your method (sqrt(5) +1)^2 can't work
2011-07-01T17:17:52  <mcstar> dont take the square root of them
2011-07-01T17:17:55  <carlop> the first distance is euclidean, the second manatthan, and they can be added easily
2011-07-01T17:18:09  <mcstar> they will be converted to floating point, and that can be bad
2011-07-01T17:18:13  <mcstar> for inequalitites
2011-07-01T17:18:46  <mcstar> carlop: all the cells he wants will be bounded above by that radius
2011-07-01T17:18:53  <mcstar> so its alright
2011-07-01T17:19:15  <antimatroid1> UncleVasya: don't assume we wont change the attack radius :)
2011-07-01T17:19:30  <antimatroid1> besides, isn't it cooler if your bot works for any attack radius?
2011-07-01T17:19:39  <carlop> mmmh, can be right, but i don't think that there is alway a euclidean radius that bound (euclidean radius + manhattan radius)
2011-07-01T17:19:45  <antimatroid1> (although i doubt it will change at this point)
2011-07-01T17:20:04  <mcstar> there is always one i can assure you
2011-07-01T17:20:11  <mcstar> take infinity for example
2011-07-01T17:20:20  <mcstar> it will bound any finite combination of the above
2011-07-01T17:20:33  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: and because of that I do not ask about what is the extended radius2 for normal radius2 5. I ask how to get it with formula :)
2011-07-01T17:21:11  <carlop> UncleVasya: i think that you can't do it generally, cause addition is not well defined
2011-07-01T17:21:47  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: I have no hardcode in my code by the religion. I hadn't it in PW and didn't cared about maps generator changing :)
2011-07-01T17:22:16  <antimatroid1> UncleVasya: :)
2011-07-01T17:22:16  <carlop> maybe for attack radius^2 = 5 and only 1 turn you can find and euclidean radius such that work
2011-07-01T17:22:22  <mcstar> antimatroid1: it isnt hard-coded btw, the engine sends those parameters...
2011-07-01T17:22:42  <antimatroid1> mcstar: yeah i know
2011-07-01T17:23:38  <mcstar> UncleVasya: how do you calculate distance?
2011-07-01T17:24:10  <carlop> mcstar: what't the radius that work for attack_radius2 = 5 and 5 turn later ?
2011-07-01T17:24:34  <carlop> i don't think exist... but maybe you can find it
2011-07-01T17:24:39  <UncleVasya> antimatroid1: [00:21:31] <carlop> UncleVasya: i think that you can't do it generally, cause addition is not well defined  <-- is it right? You are the biggest math boss here so the last word is yours.
2011-07-01T17:25:06  <mcstar> he means that you cant add euclidean and manhatten distance
2011-07-01T17:25:08  <antimatroid1> UncleVasya: also, square your distance metric :)
2011-07-01T17:25:17  <mcstar> and i agree with that
2011-07-01T17:25:30  <mcstar> but this is not were talking about
2011-07-01T17:26:01  <mcstar> carlop: he tries to access those cells that are in the attackradius of the basic area translated by the 4 directions n s e q
2011-07-01T17:26:02  <mcstar> w
2011-07-01T17:26:09  <mcstar> see?
2011-07-01T17:26:23  <carlop> yes
2011-07-01T17:26:41  <mcstar> than, you dont have to add different distances or anything
2011-07-01T17:26:45  <mcstar> its all euclidean
2011-07-01T17:27:30  <mcstar> when we say : you can see within <=sqrt(5) we dont mean manhattan distance
2011-07-01T17:27:38  <mcstar> 55 or whatever
2011-07-01T17:28:18  <carlop> if you move NNNN you are at euclidean distance 4, if you move NNWW you are at euclidean distance 2.8
2011-07-01T17:28:25  <antimatroid1> 1 dist euclidean == 1 dist manhatten
2011-07-01T17:28:43  <mcstar> but not for 2
2011-07-01T17:28:46  <mcstar> and thats ok
2011-07-01T17:28:53  <antimatroid1> if you always translate the euclidean distance by 1, you will get the surrounding squares
2011-07-01T17:29:12  <antimatroid1> well, the underlying bit, you know what i mean
2011-07-01T17:29:24  <UncleVasya> mcstar: distance2 my starter pack is  row_distance^2  * col_distance^2
2011-07-01T17:29:43  <mcstar> *?
2011-07-01T17:29:58  <mcstar> i guess thats a typo
2011-07-01T17:30:01  <carlop> maybe i've lost something reading fast, but i think that Uncle general question can't be answred checking an equivalent euclidean distance
2011-07-01T17:30:16  <UncleVasya> distance2 is squared distance.
2011-07-01T17:30:20  <mcstar> carlop: theres no general question
2011-07-01T17:30:30  <mcstar> we translate by 1 unit
2011-07-01T17:30:41  <carlop> but after 1 distance he can think of 2 step
2011-07-01T17:31:43  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i get it, but you wanted to write + instead of * right?
2011-07-01T17:32:12  <UncleVasya> oh, yes. Exusse me
2011-07-01T17:32:21  <UncleVasya> *Excuse
2011-07-01T17:33:18  <carlop> mcstar: attack radius 5, 1 step can't be ansewred too.... cell 2,2 (1 step from 2,1) have distance2 = 8
2011-07-01T17:33:37  <carlop> and cell 4,0 (2 step from 2,0) have distance2 = 8
2011-07-01T17:34:13  <mcstar> so basically my advice is, that i think has many proponents, do not check floating point numbers in inequalities, and this is even more true if the difference matters between < ans <=
2011-07-01T17:34:50  <mcstar> (i mean dont not, when you have integers instead of them, but never do x==y for flaoting points)
2011-07-01T17:35:16  <mcstar> dont->do
2011-07-01T17:36:38  <carlop> so there are cell at distance 8 both attacked and not attacked 1 turn from now
2011-07-01T17:37:36  <carlop> i think the best way can be have a boolean[dr][dc] that you populate at the beginning that is true iff the cell can be attacked 1 turn from now
2011-07-01T17:38:11  <carlop> and generation this table should not be a problem
2011-07-01T17:38:33  <UncleVasya> Thank you guys for help.
2011-07-01T17:40:01  <mcstar> wtf
2011-07-01T17:40:14  <mcstar> carlop: we dont talk about the same thing
2011-07-01T17:40:33  <mcstar> let me talk a bit
2011-07-01T17:40:56  <mcstar> x<=attackrad
2011-07-01T17:41:04  <mcstar> this gives a 2d pattern
2011-07-01T17:41:19  <mcstar> for example this for attackrad^2=5
2011-07-01T17:41:27  <mcstar>  ...
2011-07-01T17:41:34  <mcstar> .....
2011-07-01T17:41:38  <mcstar> .....
2011-07-01T17:41:42  <mcstar> hell
2011-07-01T17:42:01  <mcstar>  ...
2011-07-01T17:42:05  <mcstar> .....
2011-07-01T17:42:06  <mcstar> .....
2011-07-01T17:42:08  <mcstar> .....
2011-07-01T17:42:10  <mcstar>  ...
2011-07-01T17:42:13  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-01T17:42:15  <mcstar> this is it
2011-07-01T17:42:31  <mcstar> now, translate this pattern to N, S,E,W
2011-07-01T17:42:42  <mcstar> get the union of the patter formed
2011-07-01T17:42:47  <mcstar> which is:
2011-07-01T17:43:08  <mcstar>   ...
2011-07-01T17:43:10  <mcstar>  .....
2011-07-01T17:43:13  <mcstar> .......
2011-07-01T17:43:15  <mcstar> .......
2011-07-01T17:43:17  <mcstar> .......
2011-07-01T17:43:19  <mcstar>  .....
2011-07-01T17:43:21  <mcstar>   ...
2011-07-01T17:43:39  <mcstar> and you exactly this pattern if you take x<=attackrad+1
2011-07-01T17:43:51  <mcstar> and you get>
2011-07-01T17:44:25  <mcstar> so (sqrt(5)+1)^2 is the new checkrad2
2011-07-01T17:46:36  <mcstar> im kind of hoping for a response...
2011-07-01T17:46:53  <carlop> i'm here
2011-07-01T17:47:10  <carlop> ok, seem that we are talking of the same thing
2011-07-01T17:47:20  <carlop> say the enemy is at 0,0
2011-07-01T17:47:29  <UncleVasya> Who's painting better thay one is right :D
2011-07-01T17:47:40  <UncleVasya> *that
2011-07-01T17:51:56  <carlop> I think that you need checkrad such that if a cell have euclidean distance less than certain number it can be attacked
2011-07-01T17:52:21  <carlop> and if they have euclidean distance greater or equal can't be attacked
2011-07-01T17:52:40  <carlop> if this assumption is right (that can be our difference)
2011-07-01T17:52:54  <carlop> think an enemy in (0,0)
2011-07-01T17:53:46  <carlop> distance2 (2,2) is 8, and can be attacked
2011-07-01T17:56:28  <carlop> so sorry, my math should be checked
2011-07-01T17:56:42  <UncleVasya> 1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:43  <UncleVasya>    1 1 1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:43  <UncleVasya> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:43  <UncleVasya> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:43  <UncleVasya> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:43  <UncleVasya>    1 1 1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:44  <UncleVasya>       1 1 1
2011-07-01T17:56:55  <carlop> my apologies mcstar
2011-07-01T17:58:16  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-01T17:58:26  <mcstar> UncleVasya: is that a unicorn?
2011-07-01T17:58:49  <carlop> for attack2=5 and 1 step checkrad2 = 11 can work for example
2011-07-01T17:58:56  <mcstar> of course
2011-07-01T17:59:02  <mcstar> 10.742 too
2011-07-01T17:59:25  <UncleVasya> In the line 1 space are eaten.
2011-07-01T17:59:58  <mcstar> .472 sorry i said it from memory(which is not my strong point)
2011-07-01T18:01:26  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-4d0158c6.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-01T18:04:20  <carlop> my point is that is not the type of assumption that i raccomend, for example for attack_radius2=9 and 1 step there is no such distance
2011-07-01T18:04:32  <mleise> mcstar: I wrote a little C++ program for you: http://codepad.org/NRCSL1Y7
2011-07-01T18:04:48  <carlop> but my math for attack2 = 5 was wrong....
2011-07-01T18:05:13  <mleise> On my machine I see a clear factor 4 speed improvement using static arrays, but on the codepad server the two version seem the same
2011-07-01T18:05:58  <mcstar> carlop: again. i have to disagree
2011-07-01T18:06:17  <mcstar> pls, code it up, visualize it or whatever an you will see
2011-07-01T18:06:22  <mcstar> d
2011-07-01T18:06:48  <mcstar> mleise: ill take a look
2011-07-01T18:08:16  <UncleVasya> mcstar: if I'll round a value to the bigger integer it still will be correct?
2011-07-01T18:09:07  <mcstar> well, its better to oversetimate i guess
2011-07-01T18:09:43  <mcstar> you have to decide for yourself, depends on the situation
2011-07-01T18:12:04  <mcstar> mleise: can you initialize the arrays? at least the static one
2011-07-01T18:12:27  <mcstar> a good compiler can optimize that part(im not sure but i guess it can be done)
2011-07-01T18:12:42  <mcstar> i mean accessig elements that havent been iniitialized
2011-07-01T18:13:30  <mcstar> and you ++ elements that have no value?
2011-07-01T18:13:50  <mcstar> i mean static arrays default to 0 i guess, but dynamic arrays dont
2011-07-01T18:13:54  <UncleVasya> not-rounded float value is the value that gives me only suitable cells and no false alarms. If I round it I'll not only suitable cells but also some amount of false alarms (I will afraid cell that I no need to be afraid of)? Or even not-rounded value is not always correct?
2011-07-01T18:14:00  <mcstar> or maybe c++ memesets them ?
2011-07-01T18:14:24  <mcstar> ah, ok, you use malloc, so that part isnt initialized for sure
2011-07-01T18:14:45  <mleise> ok I'll change the code
2011-07-01T18:15:45  <mcstar> UncleVasya: the easiest is to drop floating point number altogether
2011-07-01T18:15:56  <mcstar> dont take sqare roots
2011-07-01T18:16:03  <mcstar> u
2011-07-01T18:17:46  <mcstar> mleise: the total run time of a test is 200 ms? thats clearly too small
2011-07-01T18:17:54  <mcstar> make it a couple of seconds at least
2011-07-01T18:18:01  <mcstar> 10?
2011-07-01T18:18:37  <mcstar> and dont access the same elements in the loop
2011-07-01T18:19:43  <mcstar> and the biggest problem: you get the indices to be accessed from another array
2011-07-01T18:19:53  <mleise> :(
2011-07-01T18:20:13  <mleise> a couple of seconds is bad for codepad's execute feature
2011-07-01T18:20:30  <mcstar> i dont care about codepad, use your own machine :)
2011-07-01T18:20:31  <mleise> the idea comes through in a few milliseconds
2011-07-01T18:20:45  <mleise> on my machine the factor is 4, on codepad it is 1
2011-07-01T18:21:12  <mleise> so I'm unsure now what and why the dynamic array is slow on my machine but fast on codepads
2011-07-01T18:21:50  <mcstar> so, can you do what i asked?
2011-07-01T18:21:58  <mcstar> dont use random array accesses
2011-07-01T18:22:11  <mleise> no, the random array is there to force the compiler to actually do something
2011-07-01T18:22:24  <mleise> should I go through it in sequence?
2011-07-01T18:22:25  <mcstar> that doesnt matter, and u wont have to store the indices somewhere
2011-07-01T18:22:28  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-01T18:22:48  <mleise> so... just a slim loop without 'expansion'?
2011-07-01T18:23:18  <mcstar> "expansion"?
2011-07-01T18:23:39  <mcstar> maybe ill rewrite it
2011-07-01T18:24:15  <mcstar> now theres a file named after you
2011-07-01T18:26:50  <mleise> mcstar: http://codepad.org/4gyw1B2z
2011-07-01T18:27:06  <mleise> now the static array is slower :-/ thx for that
2011-07-01T18:28:30  <mcstar> what's the speedup on your machine:
2011-07-01T18:28:32  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-01T18:28:40  <mcstar> (speeddown)
2011-07-01T18:29:51  <mleise> ~0.898
2011-07-01T18:30:08  <mcstar> thats at least something
2011-07-01T18:30:39  <mcstar> an of course youre welcome :)
2011-07-01T18:30:43  <mleise> hmm, I'm just more confused now
2011-07-01T18:30:58  <mcstar> (i tend to leave the d behind)
2011-07-01T18:31:40  <mcstar> those compilers can do crazy things
2011-07-01T18:31:57  <mcstar> i once saw a presentation on optimization in different compilers
2011-07-01T18:32:35  <mcstar> and they are pretty good, and i didnt understand most of it( i dont know assebmly) but i got the message:
2011-07-01T18:32:47  <mcstar> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
2011-07-01T18:33:27  <mcstar> it usually means dont try to be smarter than the compiler
2011-07-01T18:34:09  <mcstar> (im not sure how much this relates to the current problem, but i felt like i needed to tell that)
2011-07-01T18:34:32  <mleise> mcstar: I think I'll have to actually check my D code now to verify the different results on the real subject
2011-07-01T18:35:25  <mleise> I have that compiler switch there so it should not take too long and after all I want to be right on this :p
2011-07-01T18:36:03  <mcstar> do you code in d regularly? or just for the contest?
2011-07-01T18:47:38  <mleise> mcstar: I'd say I'm still trying it and I think it is an improvement over C++ syntax wise
2011-07-01T18:48:13  <mleise> ~1.23 is the speedup I get in the real-world test case
2011-07-01T18:49:14  <mcstar> so in D static is 1.23 faster than dynamic
2011-07-01T18:54:27  <mleise> yes, when reading the array

2011-07-01T18:54:52  <mleise> but when writing it is the same or maybe the static array is even a little slower. but that is noise in the statistic
2011-07-01T18:55:28  <mcstar> all in all, theres no big win using static arrays
2011-07-01T18:56:49  <mleise> no big win, no. but a small one :)

2011-07-01T18:59:30  <mleise> I'll do a benchmark round with static bot input before I upload to get a picture. I like premature optimization when I'm using a 'native' language.
