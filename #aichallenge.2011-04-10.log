2011-04-10T06:27:54  <antimatroid> i'm quite worried about how long my first food collection heuristic is

2011-04-10T06:42:11  <antimatroid> woudshoo: currently my food collection is as follows
2011-04-10T06:42:53  <woudshoo> Hm, what are you thinking about.  I am using a stupid greedy algorithm.  I had some troubles with speed but that was because of a stupid mistake.  I should time it again though, because it taks some time.
2011-04-10T06:43:49  <woudshoo> I think it takes at most about 0.1 a 0.2 sec with about 300 ants.  If there are more ants, I think I will limit the number of ants used for food gathering

2011-04-10T06:45:05  <antimatroid> create a grid of integers specifying when a square is available, -1 for not, 0 for starting ants
2011-04-10T06:45:06  <antimatroid> iteratively perform a bfs from all "non-collected" food squares simultaneously (i'm currently doing that sequentially, so should speed it up quite a bit) until the current distance is >= current best distance, then if the current square is available and curDist + availableTime < bestDist, use the new information, then once i've chosen a move, move the ant, and update available for the new ant and where that ant will be
2011-04-10T06:45:25  <antimatroid> i also want to try and improve that to avoid crossing paths
2011-04-10T06:45:29  <antimatroid> but even then it's not optimal
2011-04-10T06:45:55  <antimatroid> it can expand about 4-5 times faster than hunter bot though, and it doesn't move an ant currently unless that ant has been assigned a move to collect food
2011-04-10T06:47:17  <antimatroid> i quite like that though, it works pretty damn well
2011-04-10T06:47:27  <woudshoo> This is roughy what I do.  I have a grid (map) keeping track of (food, distance) pairs.  Initially this is empty.  A worker queue also queues (food, location, distance).
2011-04-10T06:47:57  <antimatroid> i think i'm killing myself by searching from each food square sequentially on each iteration
2011-04-10T06:48:00  <antimatroid> i'm currently improving that
2011-04-10T06:48:54  <woudshoo> An element is taken from the queue, it looks in the map of its neighbours.  It a neighbours has a distance value > queue element distance + 1, add it the neighbour to the queue.
2011-04-10T06:49:13  <antimatroid> do you move an already moved ant to get more food?
2011-04-10T06:49:22  <woudshoo> If it discovers an ant, move the ant closer to the food.  Important though: REMOVE all references for that food item from the queue and continue.
2011-04-10T06:49:26  <antimatroid> like say you have *....aa.**
2011-04-10T06:49:33  <antimatroid> will you send both a's right or one lefT?
2011-04-10T06:49:47  <antimatroid> i will send the left one left in that situation
2011-04-10T06:51:54  <woudshoo> It will send the left ant left, but only because (situation:  Aa.*#' ) the algorithm first walks a -> * and than tries to walk A-># around 'a' and '#' so the left ant is closer
2011-04-10T06:52:05  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-04-10T06:52:14  <antimatroid> can you see what i mean with mine though?
2011-04-10T06:52:29  <antimatroid> it will update information each iteration to use "future ants" to collect food squares
2011-04-10T06:52:32  <antimatroid> do you do that?
2011-04-10T06:52:37  <antimatroid> that's the crux to my algorithm
2011-04-10T06:53:54  <woudshoo> No, I don't update future ant creation.  My algorithm is currently quite stupid and greedy.  But honestly, I don't know how big a difference it will make. (as long as you don't get stuck and can find a path to the food.)
2011-04-10T06:54:09  <antimatroid> it makes quite a difference i assure you
2011-04-10T06:54:28  <antimatroid> otherwise you send more ants than necessary to collect certain food squares
2011-04-10T06:54:42  <antimatroid> which could be off doing something else
2011-04-10T06:55:07  <antimatroid> ah, i remember why i did it iteratively
2011-04-10T06:55:18  <antimatroid> i don't want to go for a food square that has an enemy closest to it
2011-04-10T06:55:45  <antimatroid> crap
2011-04-10T06:55:57  <woudshoo> Ah, I ignore enemies.  I have thought about avoiding enemies, but I changed my mind about that.
2011-04-10T06:56:19  <antimatroid> you may then miss out on food squares you could have gotten
2011-04-10T06:56:34  <antimatroid> and if the ant is that crap that it let you get the food, you probably can beat them anyway if you're half decent
2011-04-10T06:56:40  <antimatroid> that's my personal rational
2011-04-10T06:58:07  <woudshoo> a moment, got phone call
2011-04-10T07:02:09  <woudshoo> antimatroid:  about enemies, my thinking is that, (1) food squares with no enemy close to it, you will get anyway. (2) if you walk to the food and manage to get a 1-1 kill, the score differences won't change.
2011-04-10T07:02:43  <woudshoo> So it seems a toss up at the moment.  However I haven't done anything about fighting yet.
2011-04-10T07:02:43  <antimatroid> it might have to be done for speed anyway
2011-04-10T07:02:51  <antimatroid> i haven't done fighting either
2011-04-10T07:03:02  <antimatroid> food collection was meant to be FAST so i can trees for battles
2011-04-10T07:03:24  <antimatroid> i want to use multiple trees based on which ants can a/effect each other
2011-04-10T07:03:46  <antimatroid> then all other ants will be moved towards the closest square that hasn't been seen in the last x turns
2011-04-10T07:03:58  <antimatroid> probably not iteratively at this point :(
2011-04-10T07:04:34  <woudshoo> Interesting tidbit that last thing.  I was thinking something similar, keeping a map of probability of food being present, the longer you haven't seen it the higher it gets.  Together with a map of enemy probability.
2011-04-10T07:05:06  <antimatroid> you could use markov chains to get probabilities of ants locations
2011-04-10T07:05:12  <woudshoo> Yes, excatly!
2011-04-10T07:05:13  <antimatroid> but it'd be rank and probably not all that useful
2011-04-10T07:05:23  <antimatroid> i considered that too :)
2011-04-10T07:05:58  <antimatroid> i want to get a tcp server going already :P

2011-04-10T07:06:43  <woudshoo> I think it might payoff for the enemy distribution,  if you expand your area and the middle is not visible, you at least know there is no enemy ant present.  So deployment of forces might change on that map.
2011-04-10T07:07:12  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-10T07:07:17  <antimatroid> it would be really cool to see such a bot win
2011-04-10T07:07:52  <antimatroid> i originally wanted to try and model the probabilities of moves the enemies might make with planet wars, but it was all too messy to ever get that far
2011-04-10T07:08:05  <antimatroid> based on their past moves etc.

2011-04-10T07:09:58  <woudshoo> I think it will also be crucial to try to attack as many different enemies as possible.  If you manage to engage 3 enemies while the other bots only engage 1 or 2 you have a real advantage in the scoring rules.
2011-04-10T07:10:42  <antimatroid> i plan to use a game tree to avoid anything where i don't kill more than i lose until it's getting towards the end at which point i'll start trying to kill off ants 1:1
2011-04-10T07:11:12  <antimatroid> although one is obviously worried about how well the game trees will work
2011-04-10T07:11:53  <antimatroid> my fallback plan might have to be move ants near enemies towards their closest friend
2011-04-10T07:12:04  <antimatroid> that's an easy battle strategy to implement though
2011-04-10T07:12:10  <woudshoo> I was thinking different, if you can kill 1:1 go for it!    For example, if I kill 100 ants 1:1 with enemy B and you kill 2:1 but only 50 times with me, I have about 130 points and you 100
2011-04-10T07:12:24  <antimatroid> but with 4 other players it's not that simple
2011-04-10T07:12:32  <antimatroid> you might have another enemy with a better kill ratio
2011-04-10T07:12:39  <antimatroid> 4+ players
2011-04-10T07:13:48  <woudshoo> At the moment, I think fighting is really hard.  (Just tried on paper.)  I think just making big lines of ants and move them in a synchronized manner might be good.
2011-04-10T07:13:58  <woudshoo> Depends on how narrow the corridors are
2011-04-10T07:14:05  <antimatroid> game trees :P
2011-04-10T07:14:20  <antimatroid> i have an idea for diverting ants around "traps" (blocked, corridors)
2011-04-10T07:14:55  <woudshoo> Well I am worried that if you have about 100 ants on both sides simultanuously in battle the game trees might be unwieldly
2011-04-10T07:15:08  <antimatroid> yep definitely
2011-04-10T07:15:41  <antimatroid> i plan to partition "battling ants" into the sets of ants that can effect each other, go through for as long as possible, then revert back to moving towards the closest friend or whatever other heuristic
2011-04-10T07:16:19  <woudshoo> I was thinking of picking random close enemy ants and gang up on them.
2011-04-10T07:16:39  <woudshoo> (obviously not completely random)
2011-04-10T07:16:44  <antimatroid> that's an alright naive idea
2011-04-10T07:16:59  <antimatroid> i think game trees are win if we can get them going in time
2011-04-10T07:17:10  <antimatroid> big if though
2011-04-10T07:17:40  <antimatroid> there are cool options for backward induction on the n-player game tree too
2011-04-10T07:18:24  <antimatroid> sometimes offering potential cooperation situations, where one could use tit for tat as to whether they are willing to cooperate with the player
2011-04-10T07:18:57  <woudshoo> yeah, very big if.  Also suppose someone just position a big block of ants and let them sit.  I am worried that the game tree will just decide it is not worth attacking, and thinks it is best to just sit there.  So the evaluation function should take more into account than just ants killed.  (Area?)
2011-04-10T07:19:34  <antimatroid> yeah, i have an idea for trying to place "temporary water squares" around squares that would be stupid to move into
2011-04-10T07:19:39  <woudshoo> ah, tit for tat.  Well, interesting, how are thinking detecting 'cooperation vs defection (cheating)'
2011-04-10T07:19:41  <antimatroid> so one can divert ants around "traps"
2011-04-10T07:20:34  <antimatroid> otherwise the ants will build up there and just wait
2011-04-10T07:20:38  <antimatroid> which is obviously a waste
2011-04-10T07:20:41  <woudshoo> I was thinking for that to make a map with a desirability value and a danger value and use path finding to guide the ants to the desirable squares
2011-04-10T07:21:12  <woudshoo> Also as a random other idea, I was thinking of deviding the ants in classes, fighter ants, food gathering ants.
2011-04-10T07:21:53  <woudshoo> Yes, building up is tricky.  I will first go for fight fight fight, even if I lose some.  Just to break down the defence.

2011-04-10T07:24:59  <antimatroid> it'd be even better with a map for what turns a location will be occupied on ants paths, and take that information into account when searching

2011-04-10T07:27:45  <woudshoo> w.r.t. avoiding future ant position, It really depends on the maps though.  The current map I use for testin is quite open.  So I see ants as obstacles.  It still sees a path and next turn it will see the space is empty.  However if the maps become more maze like this will be really bad.
2011-04-10T07:28:44  <antimatroid> mine will currently try and go around the ant instead of "waiting", making it calculate stuff incorrectly

2011-04-10T07:48:03  <woudshoo> Ha, I know that experience, my current version sometimes had about 700 ants and was beaten by a hunterbot having 50.   At the moment I am actively trying to spread out my ants.  But the algorithm does not work as I expect.
2011-04-10T07:53:45  <antimatroid> i had to tell this one to stop before the time limit to stop it from timing out
2011-04-10T08:00:27  <antimatroid> turns out i wasn't even checking that the food squares were closer to me than an enemy
2011-04-10T08:04:29  <woudshoo> What I notice is that the results vary wildly between runs.  Most of the time my current version
2011-04-10T08:04:50  <woudshoo> beats the Hunterbots comfortably, but also quite often it does not.
2011-04-10T08:06:14  <antimatroid> are you doing 1v1?
2011-04-10T08:06:41  <antimatroid> if the food bonus doesn't come into play with 1v1, then the result is who fought the best, nothing else
2011-04-10T08:06:55  <antimatroid> whereas with more players, if you get eliminated early then you stop scoring
2011-04-10T08:07:03  <antimatroid> so you need to worry about growth of your colony as well
2011-04-10T08:07:23  <woudshoo> No, I am doing 3 hunterbots against me.
2011-04-10T08:07:28  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-04-10T08:07:37  <antimatroid> got a replay file for me? :P
2011-04-10T08:09:20  <woudshoo> Yeah, I am uploading it right now.  (never used pastebin before.)
2011-04-10T08:10:32  <woudshoo> http://pastebin.com/XS31EPcw
2011-04-10T08:10:47  <woudshoo> My bot has the most ants at the end (blue I think.)
2011-04-10T08:11:01  <antimatroid> i just copy paste to pastebin
2011-04-10T08:11:15  <antimatroid> codepad is good if you have a single file you want to show the output of too (it'll run it)
2011-04-10T08:12:38  <antimatroid> i think there's way too many ants on the maps
2011-04-10T08:12:51  <antimatroid> not that game, all of them
2011-04-10T08:12:53  <woudshoo> Never heard of codepad.   www.codepad.org? com?
2011-04-10T08:13:16  <antimatroid> .org
2011-04-10T08:13:44  <woudshoo> Yes, I agree, there are some many ants that you don't have to worry about not having enough ants.
2011-04-10T08:14:10  <antimatroid> yeah, and you can basically just funnel them all to the front lines

2011-04-10T08:14:42  <woudshoo> Exactly, that was my reason for wanting to engage in all 1-1 loss battles.
2011-04-10T08:14:51  <KEth_> What's that?
2011-04-10T08:14:55  <antimatroid> the ants are doing nothing but running my food collection
2011-04-10T08:14:59  <antimatroid> that's a replay file
2011-04-10T08:15:27  <antimatroid> in visualizer open copy_paste.html and paste that to there
2011-04-10T08:15:35  <KEth_> is red my obt?
2011-04-10T08:15:36  <KEth_> bot?
2011-04-10T08:15:47  <antimatroid> it's me vs hunter bot
2011-04-10T08:16:09  <KEth_> red is yours that stops?
2011-04-10T08:16:58  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-10T08:17:05  <KEth_> you mind if I run it with my bot?
2011-04-10T08:17:07  <antimatroid> i am only moving an ant that is to be used for food collection
2011-04-10T08:17:16  <KEth_> I'm quite curious to see the results
2011-04-10T08:17:19  <antimatroid> i would like to, but not really sure how to give you a runnable version
2011-04-10T08:17:31  <antimatroid> we need a tcp server :(
2011-04-10T08:17:32  <KEth_> python?
2011-04-10T08:17:35  <KEth_> you could send "pyc"
2011-04-10T08:17:36  <antimatroid> c++
2011-04-10T08:17:38  <KEth_> Oh
2011-04-10T08:17:40  <KEth_> send me exe then?
2011-04-10T08:17:47  <KEth_> I did my one in C++ as well
2011-04-10T08:17:56  <antimatroid> will it run though?
2011-04-10T08:18:00  <KEth_> of course it will
2011-04-10T08:18:03  <antimatroid> pm me your email
2011-04-10T08:19:22  <KEth_> let me know once sent
2011-04-10T08:19:32  <antimatroid> done
2011-04-10T08:19:41  <antimatroid> well it's sending
2011-04-10T08:19:50  <antimatroid> there we go
2011-04-10T08:20:03  <antimatroid> it will be super slow :P
2011-04-10T08:20:06  <antimatroid> i'm working on that
2011-04-10T08:20:07  <KEth_> It's not .exe?
2011-04-10T08:20:15  <antimatroid> i compiled on ubuntu
2011-04-10T08:20:19  <KEth_> lol
2011-04-10T08:20:22  <KEth_> I'm on windows
2011-04-10T08:20:24  <antimatroid> hence my question :P
2011-04-10T08:20:35  <KEth_> well, I thought you will compile under win
2011-04-10T08:20:45  <antimatroid> nah i can't be bothered restarting
2011-04-10T08:20:51  <antimatroid> and i'm fairly new to ubuntu
2011-04-10T08:21:11  <KEth_> mkay, that's fine.
2011-04-10T08:21:15  <KEth_> feel free to compile under windows any time
2011-04-10T08:21:58  <antimatroid> what it's doing is iteratively moving ants to the closest food square, but then possibly using that ant and the new ant from their future squares with the following food squares
2011-04-10T08:22:05  <antimatroid> accounting for when they will be available
2011-04-10T08:22:20  <KEth_> yeah, we'll see how it turns out some day
2011-04-10T08:22:47  <KEth_> are you using any pathing algorithm?
2011-04-10T08:23:06  <antimatroid> just breadth first searches from food squares
2011-04-10T08:23:22  <KEth_> I see
2011-04-10T08:23:24  <KEth_> could've been improved i noticed
2011-04-10T08:23:29  <antimatroid> i'm doing it sequentially (as i was planning to not move to a food square closer to an enemy), but it's slow as hell
2011-04-10T08:23:36  <antimatroid> it could be much better
2011-04-10T08:23:38  <KEth_> sometimes I see your ant doing 3 moves but it could do 2
2011-04-10T08:23:44  <antimatroid> really?
2011-04-10T08:23:49  <antimatroid> that's a bug
2011-04-10T08:23:52  <KEth_> of course
2011-04-10T08:23:53  <KEth_> :P
2011-04-10T08:24:00  <KEth_> because you're not testing diagonally
2011-04-10T08:24:06  <KEth_> you pickup food when you're diagonal to it
2011-04-10T08:24:11  <antimatroid> oh, yeah i'm ignoring that atm
2011-04-10T08:24:23  <KEth_> so you're wasting one move quite often
2011-04-10T08:24:39  <KEth_> I shouldn't be helping :)
2011-04-10T08:24:40  <antimatroid> yeah that's alright, i'll worry about that once the spawn radius is settled
2011-04-10T08:24:42  <KEth_> Haha
2011-04-10T08:24:50  <antimatroid> i'm fairly keen on that being 1 anyway
2011-04-10T08:25:01  <antimatroid> i don't like spawning over water

2011-04-10T09:17:23  <Stocha> i have some simple food collection algorithm that seems robust time wise.
2011-04-10T09:17:53  <Stocha> by robust i mean : i can do it under a second :p
2011-04-10T09:18:50  <woudshoo> how does it scale with map size, nr of food and nr of ants?  I haven't had any problems time wise and although it is not perfect it is good enough for now.
2011-04-10T09:19:05  <Stocha> i didn't really made any measure
2011-04-10T09:19:10  <Stocha> nor did i do any optimizations
2011-04-10T09:19:16  <Stocha> it's roughly a prototype

2011-04-10T09:20:45  <Stocha> Mine depends on map size for sure.
2011-04-10T09:21:01  <Stocha> and it depends on number of food to grab.

2011-04-10T09:21:35  <Stocha> It's a simple greedy algorithm : launch the nearest ant to the nearest food, if no ant is already going to collect it.

2011-04-10T09:22:03  <Stocha> i would love to have comparison of it against more advanced strategy.
2011-04-10T09:22:42  <woudshoo> I think we are all inventing similar methods.  antimatroid and I have similar strategies.  His is quite clever if I understood it correctly
2011-04-10T09:23:12  <Stocha> is it an advanced one, or basic greedy one ?
2011-04-10T09:23:23  <Stocha> (i'm reading the log, but didn't reach that part yet :p)
2011-04-10T09:23:36  <antimatroid> Stocha: slightly more advanced, but really slow atm
2011-04-10T09:23:48  <Stocha> but it compares it with the hunter bot. That's not a good reference.
2011-04-10T09:23:52  <antimatroid> there is a replay file for you to watch
2011-04-10T09:23:53  <woudshoo> Mine is a basic greedy one, closet ant to closest food, discard those from consideration, and continue
2011-04-10T09:24:00  <Stocha> can't you compare it with my bot antimatroid ?
2011-04-10T09:24:09  <Stocha> that would be better than using hunterbot as a reference.
2011-04-10T09:24:09  <antimatroid> Stocha: maybe tomorrow
2011-04-10T09:24:16  <antimatroid> i'm only looking at food collection
2011-04-10T09:24:23  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-10T09:24:29  <Stocha> but if the map is big enougth
2011-04-10T09:24:29  <antimatroid> i'm not moving an ant unless it needs to be used for collecting food
2011-04-10T09:24:38  <Stocha> you can watch how it does in the beginning
2011-04-10T09:24:44  <Stocha> and have some sort of ratio.
2011-04-10T09:25:01  <Stocha> ah you don't do any exploration ?
2011-04-10T09:25:14  <Stocha> well my ref bot isn't good at exploring.
2011-04-10T09:25:15  <antimatroid> put it this way, i make it to like 500 ants by the time hunter bot as 120
2011-04-10T09:25:24  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-10T09:25:28  <antimatroid> and i don't explore at all, just collect what's visible
2011-04-10T09:25:30  <Stocha> but hunter bot is disastrous
2011-04-10T09:25:52  <Stocha> chances are your current speed is no more than the simple greedy strat.
2011-04-10T09:26:01  <Stocha> because you don't use free ant to accelerate it.
2011-04-10T09:26:06  <antimatroid> it's smarter than that
2011-04-10T09:26:23  <Stocha> yeah i understand it's smarter
2011-04-10T09:26:31  <antimatroid> if it moves an ant, it'll consider the future location of that ant and the new one (accounting for when it's available) to continue collecting
2011-04-10T09:26:34  <Stocha> because it use what i call the "rebound food collection" probably :p
2011-04-10T09:26:47  <Stocha> yeah that's it
2011-04-10T09:27:09  <Stocha> still, if you do not use your free ant for exploring, you would end up with same food gathering speed as the greedy strategy.
2011-04-10T09:27:34  <antimatroid> no, it's still better
2011-04-10T09:27:44  <Stocha> okay
2011-04-10T09:27:53  <antimatroid> it'll just be even better with exploration and proper fighting
2011-04-10T09:27:55  <Stocha> i guess it can split two ant in an efficient way
2011-04-10T09:28:09  <antimatroid> exactly
2011-04-10T09:28:13  <Stocha> you should compare the two method then :p
2011-04-10T09:28:37  <Stocha> is the slownest proportional to food seen ?
2011-04-10T09:28:49  <woudshoo> Stocha: at the moment it seems that just going after visible food already forces quite a bit of exploring in the beginning.  Later on or on different maps it seems more important.
2011-04-10T09:29:20  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm being lazy
2011-04-10T09:29:30  <antimatroid> it really isn't hard to update to what should be faster, reddit is distracting
2011-04-10T09:31:26  <Stocha> woudshoo: that's awfully dependent on map settings ...
2011-04-10T09:32:18  <woudshoo> Stocah: Yes, indeed, are there any maps which are more challenging?  (I could make my own of course, hm maybe, after I am done making my own visualizer)
2011-04-10T09:32:46  <Stocha> probabilities are hard to handle when you don't know the rules :p
2011-04-10T09:32:53  <antimatroid> woudshoo: you are making a visualiser...
2011-04-10T09:33:03  <antimatroid> did you use jbotmanager at all for planet wars?
2011-04-10T09:33:07  <Stocha> woudshoo : there are map generators built in
2011-04-10T09:33:09  <antimatroid> i would love to release something like that officially
2011-04-10T09:33:16  <Stocha> you just have to plug them
2011-04-10T09:33:20  <Stocha> i know keth did that.
2011-04-10T09:33:29  <Stocha> i did'nt do any testing with the official engine myself.
2011-04-10T09:33:33  <antimatroid> keth just changed frontiers
2011-04-10T09:33:50  <Stocha> he used the map generators for sure
2011-04-10T09:34:01  <Stocha> i have seen game with asymetric map
2011-04-10T09:34:01  <woudshoo> antimatroid: well, actually more for debugging purposes.  I am wanting to visualize internal state of my bot.
2011-04-10T09:34:38  <Stocha> i think everybody needs some way to look at internal state.
2011-04-10T09:35:12  <Stocha> ASCII being the worst for it i suppose :p
2011-04-10T09:35:24  <Stocha> still enough in some cases.
2011-04-10T09:35:24  <antimatroid> i like ascii
2011-04-10T09:35:51  <Stocha> when you compare with more visual method, ascii becomes weak :p
2011-04-10T09:36:00  <Stocha> but it can be deployed faster in most cases.
2011-04-10T09:36:01  <woudshoo> Well, the visualizer will nothing be too fancy, most probably a collection of images that can be played back and forward with a slideshow program
2011-04-10T09:37:15  <antimatroid> i do wish c++ had tuples
2011-04-10T09:37:18  <Stocha> If you want do have exploratin right, you need to use food probability for unknown squares, as well as ground probabilities
2011-04-10T09:37:29  <Stocha> wich will most probably be unavailable.
2011-04-10T09:37:34  <KEth_> stocha, the only thing your bot does not consider is moving into direction of where most food is
2011-04-10T09:37:40  <KEth_> rather, you move into nearest food
2011-04-10T09:37:54  <Stocha> keth: my bot is a simple greedy strategy
2011-04-10T09:37:58  <KEth_> yeah, I know
2011-04-10T09:37:59  <antimatroid> i have that issue
2011-04-10T09:38:04  <Stocha> look at antimatroid strategy for more advanced ones.
2011-04-10T09:38:22  <KEth_> It's fine
2011-04-10T09:38:26  <KEth_> I am okay :)
2011-04-10T09:38:27  <Stocha> i have made prototypes where it does go with the densest patch of food
2011-04-10T09:38:33  <Stocha> doesn't sound too promising though
2011-04-10T09:38:41  <antimatroid> nah i don't trust that
2011-04-10T09:38:55  <woudshoo> Stocha: I am planning on using probabilities.  Even if you don't know the exact probabilities, just extrapolated ones based on visible data is better than nothing.
2011-04-10T09:39:00  <antimatroid> i've also considered going for the food squares closest to me that are closest to an enemy
2011-04-10T09:39:00  <Stocha> The real food collecting algorithm, goes in pair with exploring though.
2011-04-10T09:39:38  <Stocha> woudshoo, that doesn't too pratical. I have no idea how to do it. If map are very diversified it wont work
2011-04-10T09:39:52  <Stocha> for example : are unseen near water more likely to be water ?
2011-04-10T09:39:57  <KEth_> yeah, there is also food proritizing that would depend on enemy ants, if it can be safely taken later on and so on
2011-04-10T09:40:12  <Stocha> true
2011-04-10T09:40:22  <KEth_> I can't spoil how my system works
2011-04-10T09:40:23  <KEth_> but it does that
2011-04-10T09:41:07  <Stocha> i'm afraid game trees for fightings will be too slow. Unless you have something very clever indeed.
2011-04-10T09:41:17  <KEth_> Game trees would be fast honetsly
2011-04-10T09:41:25  <Stocha> would they ?
2011-04-10T09:41:29  <KEth_> if you know how to do it properly, using stack with pointers for example, rather than list
2011-04-10T09:41:32  <Stocha> the branching factor is quite tricky
2011-04-10T09:41:37  <KEth_> espescially if you do it in C++
2011-04-10T09:42:17  <woudshoo> KEth_: is it?  battles between 100 ants vs 100 ants each can do about 3-5 valid moves gives 3^100 combinations at least, unless you do something smart.
2011-04-10T09:42:18  <antimatroid> except the branching factor is huge and game trees are massive
2011-04-10T09:42:41  <antimatroid> well branching factor is 5 max, but for the number of ants, that's massive
2011-04-10T09:43:11  <antimatroid> but you can partition sets for game trees
2011-04-10T09:43:21  <antimatroid> and do that for as long as possible before reverting to heuristics
2011-04-10T09:43:46  <KEth_> woudshoo: I have been dealing with massive real-time physics simulation engines, I'm quite familiar with large amount of combinations. There are really plenty of ways to optimize.
2011-04-10T09:44:16  <KEth_> woudshoo: There are plenty on my head and I can imagine tree data wouldn't be slow to go up to 10 possible moves.
2011-04-10T09:45:33  <KEth_> including enemy moves
2011-04-10T09:46:48  <woudshoo> KEth_: Hm, interesting.  I always thought that physic engines were more in the O(objects^2) complexity. [Note I know nothing whatsoever about this.]  Maybe I need to check out the literature.
2011-04-10T09:47:07  <Stocha> n2 might not be a problem. If it's fast enough
2011-04-10T09:48:00  <Stocha> and you limit the maximum number of ants you put into your tree somehow
2011-04-10T09:48:14  <Stocha> i' really wonder how tree do with simultaneous turns games also.
2011-04-10T09:48:23  <Stocha> it becomes quite noisy i would guess
2011-04-10T09:48:58  <KEth_> O(objects^2) are really the most basics of collision detection. Take mpm grid based simulation as an example. You can have infinite number of particles, pretty much until you ran out of ram, rather than cpu calculations.
2011-04-10T09:49:07  <Stocha> because you theoretically can have rock/paper/scisor situation.
2011-04-10T09:49:37  <Stocha> mpm grid based, have irregular grids, or regular ones ?
2011-04-10T09:49:47  <KEth_> irregular grids?
2011-04-10T09:49:57  <Stocha> mm, i'm not clear :p
2011-04-10T09:50:02  <KEth_> I have shown you the pictures, remember?
2011-04-10T09:50:06  <KEth_> it works the same way.
2011-04-10T09:50:12  <Stocha> Let's you want to have collision detections, in a thing with big empty parts

2011-04-10T09:53:01  <KEth_> the idea is I can imagine tree data be stored and computed on bitmap, rather than calling functions. Bitmap then can be minimized to 1d array or stack structure. So you end up with having seriously fast framework and you compute everything without a single call to any function, just pure maths like physics does.

2011-04-10T09:54:57  <Stocha> i have seen a prototype of his bot.
2011-04-10T09:55:03  <Stocha> it made me very happy to look at it :)
2011-04-10T09:55:12  <Stocha> It was mediumly efficient
2011-04-10T09:55:17  <Stocha> with some strength and weakness
2011-04-10T09:55:25  <Stocha> very different from the main thread of thinking though.
2011-04-10T09:55:27  <Stocha> impressive.
2011-04-10T09:58:34  <Stocha> yeah we badly need a tcp server. Amstan on the forum said : there is already all the code in there. Let's wait for people to share it :p
2011-04-10T09:58:42  <Stocha> i understood it this way at least.

2011-04-10T10:00:13  <antimatroid> okay my bot is much faster now
2011-04-10T10:00:18  <antimatroid> i was killing myself badly
2011-04-10T10:00:30  <Stocha> ah good
2011-04-10T10:00:30  <Stocha> how much faster ?
2011-04-10T10:01:09  <antimatroid> i think i might have maxed around 80-90 ms
2011-04-10T10:01:21  <Stocha> and now ?
2011-04-10T10:01:23  <antimatroid> and that's at the heigh of lots of food being visible
2011-04-10T10:01:37  <antimatroid> no, before i had to tell it to stop calculating or it'd time out when it got to like 120 ants
2011-04-10T10:01:41  <antimatroid> which is 1000 ms
2011-04-10T10:01:49  <Stocha> ah so, you don't time out now, but roughly
2011-04-10T10:01:54  <Stocha> what map size do you use ?
2011-04-10T10:02:06  <antimatroid> symmetric10
2011-04-10T10:02:09  <Stocha> well, in real game, you won't have much occasion to have lost of food
2011-04-10T10:02:19  <Stocha> it's up to 170x170 ?
2011-04-10T10:02:20  <woudshoo> antimatroid: Good!  I think it is similar to what I am seeing.
2011-04-10T10:02:35  <antimatroid> woudshoo: what language are you using?
2011-04-10T10:02:42  <woudshoo> common lisp

2011-04-10T10:04:37  <KEth_> Oh yeah, we both use c++
2011-04-10T10:05:01  <antimatroid> i'm planning to run away to haskell

2011-04-10T10:05:10  <woudshoo> typical?
2011-04-10T10:05:22  <antimatroid> lots of lispers lately
2011-04-10T10:05:29  <antimatroid> well considering it's lisp
2011-04-10T10:05:38  <KEth_> lisp is good for AI
2011-04-10T10:05:45  <antimatroid> yes i have heard :)
2011-04-10T10:05:52  <antimatroid> and observed one could say
2011-04-10T10:06:01  <Stocha> your pastebin doesn't work with my old visu antimatroid :'(
2011-04-10T10:06:10  <antimatroid> get a new copy of it :P
2011-04-10T10:06:14  <woudshoo> Ah, I don't keep track of that.  KEth_: I don't necessarily think it is good for AI, but indeed people say that.
2011-04-10T10:06:48  <Stocha> best langage for ai sor far. is java :p

2011-04-10T10:07:00  <antimatroid> java sucks period :P
2011-04-10T10:07:42  <Keth> well, lisp is all about procedural algorithms, link based structures which are really fast
2011-04-10T10:08:04  <Keth> reminds me of asm but focused more on linking data
2011-04-10T10:08:38  <woudshoo> Keth, it has good object orientation as well :-)
2011-04-10T10:08:57  <Keth> never used it.
2011-04-10T10:10:18  <Stocha> isn't 10x10 a little bit too zoomy ?
2011-04-10T10:10:33  <woudshoo> Stocha: Were you the one who published a java jar bot?
2011-04-10T10:10:42  <Stocha> it's me yes
2011-04-10T10:11:18  <Keth> It's a good bot.
2011-04-10T10:11:28  <Keth> we both ran some simulations against my bot
2011-04-10T10:11:32  <woudshoo> Ah, nice to see, your bot completely trashes mine in the fighting phase.  Food gathering is comparable i think.
2011-04-10T10:12:33  <Stocha> yeah we probably do it the same.
2011-04-10T10:12:45  <Stocha> because it's really what most people will try first :)
2011-04-10T10:13:24  <Stocha> I think it represents the 3 idea most people will try.
2011-04-10T10:13:43  <woudshoo> I haven't looked at fighting yet.  I am a bit stuck on trying to make sure my ants spread out.  The theory is sound, but practice does not listen to theory :-)
2011-04-10T10:13:44  <Stocha> but i'm wondering about the last one. Because people speak of it, but i dont know if they will actually try it :p
2011-04-10T10:13:57  <Stocha> The thing is, my bot don't fight.
2011-04-10T10:14:09  <Stocha> it's amazing how people think it does :p
2011-04-10T10:14:38  <Stocha> it just have three simple heuristic for moving ants.
2011-04-10T10:14:43  <Keth> Stocha, didn't you say your bot bombs enemy territory?
2011-04-10T10:14:45  <Stocha> greedy food being the first one.
2011-04-10T10:15:00  <woudshoo> Oh, I didn't think your bot was 'fighting' it is just that mine sets its ants up to be killed if two or three ants come close to it!
2011-04-10T10:15:08  <Stocha> yeah, it mecanically do that. but that's when you look at the game that you "see" this behavior
2011-04-10T10:15:14  <Stocha> there was no code for doing that.
2011-04-10T10:15:23  <Keth> I see
2011-04-10T10:16:09  <Stocha> I think you have to anticipate what's unknown to have a good bot. And i'm not sure it is possible; Unless you hack through official map generation.
2011-04-10T10:18:03  <Stocha> I think i need more time. just more time.
2011-04-10T10:18:10  <Stocha> a lot more time.
2011-04-10T10:19:29  <Stocha> I have begun to refactor all my junk. I wonder if it wise. bitmaps calculation doesn't sound that promising. Outside of very simple behaviors.
2011-04-10T10:19:39  <Stocha> Maybe it would if i optimized it.
2011-04-10T10:19:46  <Stocha> but i sure don't want to do that now.
2011-04-10T10:23:28  <Keth> Stocha, your bot messes up my seed sometimes
2011-04-10T10:24:05  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-10T10:24:20  <Stocha> let me have a quick look
2011-04-10T10:25:09  <Stocha> it uses a fixed seed.
2011-04-10T10:25:24  <Keth> you sure?
2011-04-10T10:25:27  <Stocha> so if you too use a fixed seed .. it shouldn't do anything fancy
2011-04-10T10:25:31  <Stocha> yeah i have the code here.
2011-04-10T10:25:41  <Keth> well, I sometimes end up with different results on the same seed
2011-04-10T10:25:44  <Keth> hunter bot works fine
2011-04-10T10:26:21  <Stocha> i have no clue
2011-04-10T10:26:42  <Keth> okay, that's fine
2011-04-10T10:26:49  <Stocha> unless i changed the code after publishing. Which i don't think i did.
2011-04-10T10:27:13  <Stocha> But if you change anything his behavior will change
2011-04-10T10:27:40  <Stocha> but i guess you are not changing anything anyway.
2011-04-10T10:28:08  <Stocha> can you send me too games behaving differently ?
2011-04-10T10:28:12  <Stocha> two
2011-04-10T10:28:18  <Keth> hm, it happens rarely
2011-04-10T10:28:31  <Keth> i will get replays if it will happen again
2011-04-10T10:28:42  <Stocha> maybe you have arrays out of bounds in your c code.
2011-04-10T10:28:46  <Stocha> c is good for that :p
2011-04-10T10:28:50  <Keth> I have checksum made for my bot
2011-04-10T10:29:11  <Keth> I ran 100 games with hunter bot, checksum stays same
2011-04-10T10:29:16  <Keth> with your bot, the checksum changes
2011-04-10T10:29:17  <Stocha> java is good at not being random.
2011-04-10T10:29:25  <Stocha> ah
2011-04-10T10:29:31  <Stocha> well,
2011-04-10T10:29:45  <Keth> it's fine
2011-04-10T10:29:50  <Keth> I will just test with hunter bot for a while
2011-04-10T10:30:00  <Stocha> so you run game with A setting, and get As sum. and then do that agains a get A's ?
2011-04-10T10:30:16  <Keth> Hm?
2011-04-10T10:30:22  <Stocha> that's a problem if people are to use this bot for testing, and have the same trouble
2011-04-10T10:30:29  <Keth> What's A setting?
2011-04-10T10:30:45  <Stocha> let's say A are the seed of a game. The map, the food generation, the bot starting, the bots seed etc.
2011-04-10T10:31:16  <Stocha> then you do two run with A, and end up with replay files having different checksum ?
2011-04-10T10:31:53  <Keth> not what I meant but yeah, that is what happens.
2011-04-10T10:32:36  <Stocha> what did you meant ?
2011-04-10T10:32:54  <Stocha> woudchoo: why is your bot (the blue one?) trembling like that ?
2011-04-10T10:33:09  <Stocha> woudshoo: why is your bot (the blue one?) trembling like that ?
2011-04-10T10:33:15  <Keth> Show me replay =D
2011-04-10T10:33:20  <Keth> pastebin
2011-04-10T10:33:43  <Stocha> the replay for woudshoo bot ?
2011-04-10T10:33:46  <Keth> yeah
2011-04-10T10:34:31  <Stocha> maybe i should stop sleeping. In order to have more time.

2011-04-10T10:35:24  <Stocha> i really see me getting nowhere with one hours/ day
2011-04-10T10:35:33  <woudshoo> Stocha: that is because I am experimenting with code to disperse the ants.  This code has 1- bugs, 2- it will vibrate because it will move away, but other ants will move too and move back.  But mostly it is a bug.
2011-04-10T10:36:37  <Keth> I like the trembling
2011-04-10T10:36:38  <Keth> reminds me of my bot
2011-04-10T10:36:41  <Stocha> ah yeah. ant dispertion. my ref bot really lack the feature. I had simple experimental code. i didn't put in. because it wanted to jump in the water all the time :p
2011-04-10T10:36:41  <Keth> :)
2011-04-10T10:37:12  <Stocha> I have to get out of bitmap somehow.
2011-04-10T10:37:32  <woudshoo> Stocha: I had other mechanism, just going NE and this bot is in practice actually stronger, because 1 - it moves faster over the map (because of the bugs.) 2 - it concentrates ants more when reaching enemy territory

2011-04-10T15:36:25  <Stocha> now i have to build the bot
2011-04-10T15:36:39  <Stocha> i tryed with random bots, but that's not very fun to watch :p

2011-04-10T16:11:16  <jbroman> Stocha: It would seem to encourage people to flood the servers with bots (marginally increasing their chances while consuming capacity that would be better used by other players).
2011-04-10T16:12:08  <Stocha> with 5000 contestant that seems fair.
2011-04-10T16:12:19  <Naktibalda> ga
2011-04-10T16:12:22  <Stocha> to dissallow multiple submission
2011-04-10T16:12:34  <Stocha> can some change the langage he used during the contest ?
2011-04-10T16:12:34  <Naktibalda> 1 game every 2-6 hours wasn't very fair
2011-04-10T16:12:44  <Stocha> for example start with a java bot, and then switch to a c bot ?
2011-04-10T16:13:01  <jbroman> Stocha: Yes, that's possible.
2011-04-10T16:13:08  <Stocha> okay.

2011-04-10T17:06:56  <ahmedhelal> i only skipped starter packs (*.zip, *.tar, *.tz)
2011-04-10T17:07:18  <ahmedhelal> amstan_: and it doesnt use separate css/js for each file
2011-04-10T17:08:26  <janzert> ahmedhelal: that can't be complete
2011-04-10T17:08:54  <janzert> it's not quite 50MB and the replay data alone on the current site is something like 58GB
2011-04-10T17:09:40  <woudshoo> Stocha: I will go to bed soon, but curious, what do you mean with unresonablegames
2011-04-10T17:12:08  <Stocha> big games with huge food
2011-04-10T17:12:12  <Stocha> i'll post some applet on the forums
2011-04-10T17:12:20  <Stocha> so you'll be able to see by yourself
2011-04-10T17:12:30  <Stocha> i will post them in like 15 minutes i think
2011-04-10T17:15:22  <ahmedhelal> janzert: it's compressed, and i checked various pages, various data, all works so far
2011-04-10T17:15:34  <amstan_> janzert: i think the 58GB is for all games
2011-04-10T17:15:44  <amstan_> janzert: but we only display the latest leaderboards on the site
2011-04-10T17:15:50  <amstan_> so it might be accurate
2011-04-10T17:15:55  <janzert> yeah, it uncrompesses to 595MB
2011-04-10T17:16:05  <janzert> but only 11,0064 files
2011-04-10T17:16:18  <janzert> err, 11,064
2011-04-10T17:16:27  <ahmedhelal> yeah its not complete

2011-04-10T17:16:34  <janzert> there were 700,000 games in the finals alone
2011-04-10T17:16:40  <ahmedhelal> janzert: you are right :)
2011-04-10T17:17:21  <janzert> btw, the full replay data is 50.9GB
2011-04-10T17:17:25  <janzert> I was misremembering
2011-04-10T17:18:18  <ahmedhelal> i used Httrack's spider http://www.httrack.com/page/2/en/index.html
2011-04-10T17:19:09  <ahmedhelal> it's smart enough to grab the visualizer's data (ajax) and hard codes it in the page's js
2011-04-10T17:19:16  <ahmedhelal> instead of saving just the call
2011-04-10T17:20:02  <janzert> looks like the file naming method it is using would only be able to handle a maximum of 0xffff games, i.e. 65536
2011-04-10T17:20:27  <janzert> but it's not even completely filling that in, although I don't have any idea why
2011-04-10T17:20:56  <ahmedhelal> it's not a complete mirror , i just found out that the download was paused or disconnected
2011-04-10T17:21:07  <janzert> ahh
2011-04-10T17:21:29  <ahmedhelal> it's slow to do it from myside, but i believe if u run it on the server itself, it should be a 1 minute thing i guess
2011-04-10T17:21:58  <janzert> I think you're overly optimistic :)
2011-04-10T17:22:15  <ahmedhelal> the replay data is as huge as you mentioned ?
2011-04-10T17:22:21  <janzert> yes
2011-04-10T17:22:41  <janzert> at least if you mean my corrected number of 50.9GB
2011-04-10T17:22:42  <ahmedhelal> but amstan was saying that only the latest are kept onsite
2011-04-10T17:22:53  <janzert> that's not correct
2011-04-10T17:23:16  <ahmedhelal> aha
2011-04-10T17:23:22  <janzert> they're all still there in one database table :/
2011-04-10T17:25:08  <ahmedhelal> janzert: well more copying time then, but the process should work, yeah ?
2011-04-10T17:26:25  <janzert> well, except for 2 things
2011-04-10T17:26:47  <janzert> the filenaming scheme it is using runs out of names after 65536 games
2011-04-10T17:26:53  <Stocha> woudshoo: okay i posted them ...
2011-04-10T17:27:09  <ahmedhelal> janzert: are we sure about that ? i mean the mirror wasnt completed yet..
2011-04-10T17:27:15  <Stocha> Normal map size,  http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Unreason_80x80_AntDieOnSameSquare/
2011-04-10T17:27:27  <janzert> and even after that, most filesystems will probably blow up with that many files in one directory anyway
2011-04-10T17:27:33  <woudshoo> Stocha: I was just shutting down, oh well who needs sleep.
2011-04-10T17:27:36  <Stocha> Big map size http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Unreason_128x128_AntDieOnSameSquare/
2011-04-10T17:27:49  <Stocha> Huge map size (upper bound that McLeopold gave for map size) http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Unreason_256x256_AntDieOnSameSquare/
2011-04-10T17:27:58  <janzert> it's using a 4 digit hex number for each repeated base filename
2011-04-10T17:28:09  <Stocha> Well, i had no idea for bots, so i made this fun stuff :p
2011-04-10T17:28:11  <janzert> maybe it's smart enough to expand it when it hits the limit
2011-04-10T17:28:19  <janzert> but still the filesystem won't
2011-04-10T17:28:20  <ahmedhelal> yea..
2011-04-10T17:28:38  <Stocha> woudshoo: not geek that want to particpate to those contest, and have a wife, two little girls, and a job.
2011-04-10T17:28:58  <Stocha> i should go to bed nonetheless i guess
2011-04-10T17:29:07  <Stocha> it least i have produced something for once p
2011-04-10T17:29:15  <Stocha> even if it's silly
2011-04-10T17:29:17  <ahmedhelal> janzert: ok thats 1 , what about 2 ?
2011-04-10T17:30:06  <Stocha> I have made a fast bot that approximate the behavior of the reference bot i gave to the community. The viewer is too slow for big maps. So i render one frame for every 4 moves. I used "AntDieOnSameSquare" fighting rule, because other rules where simply too slow.
2011-04-10T17:30:22  <janzert> the 4 digit hex number filename was 1, the filesystem number of files in a single directory was 2
2011-04-10T17:30:23  <Stocha> have fun. or not :p
2011-04-10T17:32:28  <ahmedhelal> janzert: aha, didnt know that the numbers are that big
2011-04-10T17:33:34  <janzert> yeah, it is a huge number of games
2011-04-10T17:34:23  <janzert> we could /probably/ get away with just keeping the games from the finals, but that is still 702,112 :/
2011-04-10T17:34:50  <Stocha> nice number :)
2011-04-10T17:35:08  <woudshoo> Stocha: It is really pretty to look at.  Well, I am just lucky that today I was on my own.  Partner on a little holiday.
2011-04-10T17:35:39  <woudshoo> Well I am definitely going to bad, have to be back at work.
2011-04-10T17:35:42  <Stocha> ah you don't have a wife/husband to drive you mad
2011-04-10T17:35:59  <Stocha> yeah i'll go too, see you. Thanks for finding the thing pretty :p
2011-04-10T17:36:36  <woudshoo> Stocha: not tonight, but she will be back :-)
2011-04-10T17:36:39  <woudshoo> Good night
2011-04-10T17:37:43  <ahmedhelal> janzert: could we do a modification on the server so that it maps the visualizer page to a variable page name ?
2011-04-10T17:37:47  *** woudshoo <woudshoo!~user@ironhead.xs4all.nl> has quit IRC (Quit: ERC Version 5.3 (IRC client for Emacs))
2011-04-10T17:40:19  <janzert> it could probably be made to accept urls of that form with an apache rewrite rule, but it would be difficult to change other pages that link to them to use that
2011-04-10T17:41:45  <ahmedhelal> janzert: we could do that manually by writing a script or so that will loop through all html files and replace the urls or manually rewrite them
2011-04-10T17:43:25  <janzert> might as well write the download script as well to both rewrite the links and place the games in an appropriate spot
2011-04-10T17:44:44  <ahmedhelal> yeah
2011-04-10T17:45:35  <ahmedhelal> janzert: am not sure if we can find a better spider out there for downloading the pages, better than that of httrack
2011-04-10T17:46:09  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@145.115-50-210.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-10T17:46:38  <janzert> yes, I basically meant write a custom one
2011-04-10T17:48:31  <ahmedhelal> boring task :)
2011-04-10T17:49:10  <amstan_> janzert: so.. how much data are we talking about then?

2011-04-10T17:49:40  <amstan_> 58 gb might be too annoying to handle
2011-04-10T17:49:45  <janzert> for everything about 52GB
2011-04-10T17:49:53  <amstan_> so i suggest just keeping the games we care about(from the finals)

2011-04-10T17:53:40  <janzert> so 50.9GB for 5393347 games so for just the final 702112 games it should be roughly 6.6GB of replay data
2011-04-10T17:53:56  <jbroman> The data is probably highly compressible. May I suggest gzip?
2011-04-10T17:54:41  <janzert> yes, it certainly is but if we want to serve it as static pages I don't know of a way to have the server serve it from a compressed file
2011-04-10T17:55:12  <jbroman> janzert: I believe Apaches does this automatically (at least for browsers which support the encoding).
2011-04-10T17:55:17  <jbroman> s/Apaches/Apache/
2011-04-10T17:55:33  <janzert> the server will serve it compressed yes
2011-04-10T17:55:46  <janzert> it sits on the server disk uncompressed though

2011-04-10T17:56:12  <jbroman> janzert: Apache will also served compressed data directly (I don't think it will uncompress for other clients, though – not sure if we care about that).
2011-04-10T17:56:16  <jbroman> Trying to recall the module name.
2011-04-10T17:56:20  <janzert> ahh
2011-04-10T17:57:09  <janzert> if we're only keeping the finals I don't think 7GB is that horrible anyway
2011-04-10T17:57:27  <jbroman> mod_negotiation
2011-04-10T17:57:45  <jbroman> If foo.txt does not exist, foo.txt.gz does and the client accepts gzipped content, Apache will serve foo.txt.gz instead.
2011-04-10T17:57:47  <janzert> you still need to find a way to store the files that won't blow up the filesystem of course
2011-04-10T17:57:55  <janzert> nice

2011-04-10T20:14:28  <Frontier> janzert: Serving compressed files is no problem if you use a compressed file system. No need for Apache to know anything about the compression. I'm using SquashFS myself with good results.

2011-04-10T20:16:16  <Frontier> There are other more experimental file systems that work with Fuse and compress files individually, but in our case a single SquashFS file with the web site directory in it should be all we need.
2011-04-10T20:19:37  <Frontier> It uses gzip by the way (until lzma is also available in the kernel)
