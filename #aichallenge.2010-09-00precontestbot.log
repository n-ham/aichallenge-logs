[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:34:24] <j3camero>	Okay we can move stuff into this channel I suppose. We could even do admin work here. I don't see why not.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:34:44] <j3camero>	No need to be so secretive, since everything is open source. Not like last time.

[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:35:17] <j3camero>	@amstan: do you wanna create a forum announcement about the IRC channel?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:35:33] <amstan>	what if we need a group discussion between organizers?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:37:47] <j3camero>	We will make a channel then I suppose.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:38:01] <j3camero>	I could see a need if there was a successful attack, for example.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [22:38:24] <j3camero>	We could create one pre-emptively if you like.

[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:01:03] <j3camero>	a1k0n: please tell me the story. Can you email me? I am about to hit the sack. First day of work tomorrow.

[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:03:52] <a1k0n>	nice
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:03:58] <j3camero>	Actually it's got me some more job offers too. There's a couple recruiters harassing me to quit my current job and join them instead. Booyah.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:04:12] <a1k0n>	cool.  your current job interning at google?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:04:23] <a1k0n>	or is tha tno longer current
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:04:25] <j3camero>	Nope that was a year ago. Now I work at a bank.

[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:05:04] <Zannick>	oh, right.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:05:04] <amstan>	only i had like 4 crappy jobs this summer, i really need to get out more
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:05:25] <Zannick>	is the only restriction on competing not being part of the team running the contest?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:05:36] <amstan>	Zannick: hold on, there's a thing i wrote from that
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:05:39] <amstan>	for*
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:05:49] <Zannick>	as in, i work for google, i don't want to be disqualified later for it

[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:06:15] <amstan>	a1k0n: can you forward to amstan@csclub.uwaterloo.ca too please?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:06:21] <amstan>	i would really like hearing about it too
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:06:21] <a1k0n>	ok.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:06:28] <a1k0n>	i actually turned google's offer down
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:06:31] <Zannick>	kk
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:06:43] <j3camero>	@amstan: can you take care of this? http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=403
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:07:02] <amstan>	j3camero: i think it's because of the logo, pgpaskar modified it, idk what he did
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:07:12] <amstan>	i noticed it too, on ie6
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:08:05] <j3camero>	IE was like 4.5% of our traffic last time. Still, it would be great to fix it. I imagine most journalists would be using IE, for example.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:08:35] <j3camero>	@amstan: can you talk with pgpaskar and try to get the IE problem sorted out?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:08:43] <amstan>	j3camero: i will
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:04] <j3camero>	@amstan: awesome.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:06] <amstan>	oh what joys IE brings us every year
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:13] <amstan>	j3camero: the '@' is not required
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:19] <amstan>	it just shows up because i'm op
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:25] <j3camero>	Okay I cannot do any more. That's enough replying and ticket filing for me today. I gotta hit the sack. First day of my new job tomorrow!
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:33] <Zannick>	good luck!
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:41] <j3camero>	Zannick: which team at Google?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:09:53] <j3camero>	I interned with the web search team in MTV last year.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:10:05] <Zannick>	SRE, google accounts
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:10:08] <Zannick>	like gmail, etc.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:11:16] <Zannick>	i'm still pretty new
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:11:57] <Zannick>	i like to think they hired me because i had volunteer bughunting/fixing on my resume from an open-source roguelike i play
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:13:19] <j3camero>	Zannick: awesome. Have you been through a major Gmail outage yet? We had a big one last summer. It was pretty exciting.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:13:32] <amstan>	Zannick: good thing to know, i'm also looking for a job at google
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:13:35] <Zannick>	so you might see me submit some more patches :)
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:13:52] <Zannick>	amstan: good work experience, always a plus

[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:14:41] <Zannick>	amstan: i can't really say yea or nay on what's good to have, though
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:14:51] <ebrahim>	Hi a1k0n. Do you plan to take part in the new contest?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:14:56] <amstan>	Zannick: of course, everyone's different
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:15:03] <j3camero>	Zannick: yeah more patches! It's like the best thing ever when people submit patches!
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:15:17] <amstan>	j3camero: nice to have it open source, eh?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:15:21] <Zannick>	j3camero: i already submitted two!
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:15:22] <j3camero>	Zannick: check out the issue list now. I need some serious help.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:15:38] <Zannick>	and i'm just gonna confuse everyone when i say that i go by different names everywhere :P
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:15:50] <j3camero>	Zannick: I can show you around the codebase if you want help. It's up to you.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:16:23] <Zannick>	i've already done some diving, but i'll try to help out later
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:16:41] <j3camero>	Zannick: yep at your own leisure, of course.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:16:50] <Zannick>	and don't let me keep you from sleeping! :)
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:17:03] <j3camero>	Zannick: it is an axiom that the issue list always expands faster than it can possibly be shrunk. I am used to it.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:17:57] <amstan>	j3camero: you're going to die tomorrow, go Zzzz
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:19:14] <amstan>	so... my plans for this channel... a handy bot that you can ask it the latest results
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:19:52] <Zannick>	irc bots are fun
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:19:57] <amstan>	very
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:20:35] Join	mistabell has joined this channel (46ad57b3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.70.173.87.179).
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:20:51] <amstan>	looks like the webchat link is helping
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:20:59] <amstan>	mistabell: welcome!
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:21:03] <mistabell>	hello!
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:21:15] <mistabell>	the webchat link is nice.  sweet irc client
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:21:44] <amstan>	i tought it would be a good idea for people that are not that familiar with irc clients, or just for convenience's sake
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:22:04] <amstan>	it might later prove to be a security problem, we had this problem last year with some trolls
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:22:12] <amstan>	but till then it's nice
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:25:18] <mistabell>	I missed out on the Tron challenge.  I don't quite get how these are ranked.  Are there random battles every so often between bots?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:26:10] <amstan>	mistabell: yes, right now we're picking 2 random bots
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:26:16] <amstan>	doing a battle and seeing who wins
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:26:28] <amstan>	then we have an algorithm for ranking them
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:26:31] <mistabell>	So if you have a few battles, then modify your code
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:26:42] <mistabell>	the new code counts in the new battles?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:01] <amstan>	the battles are always associated with code version i think
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:11] <mistabell>	cool, makes sense
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:17] <amstan>	if you put a new bot in, it's like the old battles never happened
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:29] <mistabell>	oh, ok
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:35] <amstan>	example: if you have a random bot, and by pure chance it won all the matches
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:44] Quit	ebrahim has left this server (Remote host closed the connection).
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:27:57] <amstan>	if you reupload again, and you loose one match, it doesn't matter that you won all of these before
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:28:31] <mistabell>	so if you get a good score, it might be better not to upload again?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:29:29] <amstan>	i think with our algorithm this is not a problem anymore
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:29:37] <amstan>	it used to be, but afaik it's not anymore
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:29:39] <mistabell>	cool, I won't worry about it
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:30:07] <amstan>	we will drill the bots until we're confident it was not just pure chance that made them win
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:30:16] <j3camero>	mistabell: the slate is wiped 100% clean when you resubmit
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:30:34] <mistabell>	good stuff.  I'm probably going to need to resubmit a few times once I see how these bots actually do
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:30:42] <amstan>	j3camero: aren't you sleeping?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:30:57] <mistabell>	see you guys friday
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:30:59] <j3camero>	Okay, I want to give everyone in here an account right now, so that we can start to get feedback before Friday. Who is in?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:31:06] <mistabell>	ah, that would be cool
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:31:13] <j3camero>	Anyone else?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:31:45] <j3camero>	What I will do is open the account creation form for five minutes, and you can all get your acounts. Then I will close it once more. Everyone let me know when they're ready.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:31:53] <j3camero>	That means you a1k0n :-)
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:31:58] <mistabell>	cheaters!  jk

[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:34:55] <Zannick>	mine is up
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:36:17] <mistabell>	so, I just need to upload a zip of MyBot.java?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:36:30] <mistabell>	don't need to make a jar or anything?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:36:42] <amstan>	mistabell: you don't have to hurry with that, just make sure you have an account
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:36:55] <mistabell>	cool
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:37:04] <amstan>	mistabell: upload the starter package, it's a valid submission
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:40:13] <j3camero>	amstan: almost 20,000 pageviews today, and it's not even open yet. Wow. Do you realize that's 40% of the entire total pageviews for Google AI Challenge RPS?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:40:25] <amstan>	lol
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:41:06] <mistabell>	Hmm.  I tried 2 submits.  Not sure why it bounced back
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:41:13] <mistabell>	Most likely user error.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:41:22] <amstan>	mistabell: you get emails with feedback
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:41:31] <j3camero>	I hope this one explodes bigger than the last one once Reddit gets hold of it on Friday/Saturday. Except I also hope that the web server holds up.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:41:57] <j3camero>	mistabell: let us know if you get an email telling you your entry compiled successfully or unsuccessfully.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:01] <mistabell>	error "The auto-compile environment could not locate your main code file.  You must include exactly one file with one of the following names:"
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:08] <j3camero>	lol pwned
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:12] <mistabell>	I send one zip with just MyBot.java and MyBot.class
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:16] <mistabell>	and I sent one zip with the entire folder
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:19] <mistabell>	they compile on my machine ok
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:26] <j3camero>	Hmm that's bad.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:30] <mistabell>	both bounced back
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:43] <amstan>	mistabell: so.. same format as the package you downloaded?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:50] <mistabell>	One sec.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:42:58] <j3camero>	Can you fire me an email telling me more? cameron.jp@gmail.com. I will get it tomorrow.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:43:23] <mistabell>	Sure thing
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:43:25] <amstan>	i was about to say post it on the forums... but i forgot this was secret
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:43:25] <amstan>	lol
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:44:04] <mistabell>	cool, email sent with the zips I tried.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:44:10] <mistabell>	hopefully something obvious there
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:44:45] <j3camero>	Okay cool I will look at them now actually.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:44:58] <amstan>	j3camero: tip: use your @ai-contest email
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:45:26] <j3camero>	Oh I know what's wrong. You need to get a real computer.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:45:30] <mistabell>	lol
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:45:32] <mistabell>	macified it?
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:45:37] <j3camero>	Oh yeah. I forgot I had that ai-contest.com email.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:45:38] <j3camero>	hehe
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:45:42] <Zannick>	haha
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:46:20] <j3camero>	Yeah it's a problem with the zip files created by mac computers. I knew there was an issue before, but only when I looked at your files did I realize the cause. I will fix it soon don't worry.
[Monday 06 September 2010] [23:46:29] <Zannick>	reddit already got a hold of you guys last week, that's how i found it

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:02:15] <amstan>	antimatroid: i am not sure, i'll leave this for jeff
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:03:00] <antimatroid>	yep, I personally don't mind, in fact it'd probably be an advtange, but if too may peoples bots were crippled it might be a bit of a disaster
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:03:23] <amstan>	so... hold on... you have like 7 points here
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:03:33] <amstan>	what are you referring to?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:04:04] <antimatroid>	yeah sorry, the one about sending say 10 fleets from planet i to planet j as 10 separate fleets rather than one fleet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:05:01] <amstan>	you mean s/fleets from planet/ships from planet/g
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:05:09] <amstan>	right?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:06:04] <antimatroid>	ha, sorry, Yes, say you want to send 10 ships from planet i to planet j on turn t, then you could do this as 10 separate fleets in the one turn.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:06:23] <amstan>	you might want to correct that in your posts, you have that error there too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:06:31] <antimatroid>	cheers
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:06:38] <amstan>	well.. i guess that depends on how time passes in the game
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:06:46] <amstan>	i am not actually familiar with the game mechanics
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:06:58] <amstan>	how does time go by?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:07:03] <amstan>	realtime? or is it turn based?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:07:20] <antimatroid>	turn based, each player has 1 second to make a turn
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:07:52] <amstan>	i think this should be fixed in the engine level then
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:08:17] <amstan>	if it notices 2 or more groups of ships heading for the same planet, to merge them before sending this info to the other playet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:08:19] <amstan>	player*
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:09:27] <antimatroid>	that would be my suggestion, otherwise perhaps explicitly stating to people that fleets can be sent like that as a precaution

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:19:30] <antimatroid>	have you guys even tried playing around with the symmetric 3 planet case for this game
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:19:34] <antimatroid>	i love how complicated it is
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:20:00] <amstan>	oh man.. i should try to play this
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:20:32] <amstan>	it's definitely another perspective once i know the game
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:20:47] <amstan>	i will definitely loose the game too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:21:04] <amstan>	;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:24:49] <rwa>	antimatroid, I did that briefly, yes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:25:30] <antimatroid>	rwa: did you even work out perfect play even in the 3 planet case?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:25:44] <antimatroid>	we're still trying to get it correct aha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:26:00] <rwa>	antimatroid:  nope.  It might be a fun exercise but I'm not sure the result will be terribly useful for the full game.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:27:34] <antimatroid>	no, we approached it for that, but in the end it was just a fun little exercise
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:27:40] <antimatroid>	was/is*
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:50:56] <rwa>	http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=390&p=2392#p2392
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:51:00] <rwa>	am I making sense there?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:51:29] <a1k0n>	seriously i think it doesn't even matter which order you evaluate it in
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:52:01] <a1k0n>	except for the case of the one extra ship required to take over the planet, and i can't tell whether that's a bug or not
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:52:03] <Zannick>	off-by-one distinctions, mostly
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:52:22] <Zannick>	a1k0n: that was a bug that has been fixed
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:52:54] <a1k0n>	so if the planet has X, and you attack with Y, then there are |X-Y| dudes left, right?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:52:56] <rwa>	there definitely is (or was) a bug relating to an extra ship needed
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:53:16] <Zannick>	i do not know whether the bugfix for that extra ship has gone into the .zip packages yet or not
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:53:19] <rwa>	you can see this by sending 1 ship to a neutral planet with 0 population.  It remains neutral with zero population.  That can't be right.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:53:42] <a1k0n>	yeah.  it's amusing that the code to calculate it iterates by subtracting by 1, rather than just.. subtracting
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:53:43] <rwa>	let me try... I have a test case for it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:53:43] <Zannick>	but i submitted that patch and it was accepted
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:53:56] <antimatroid>	rwa: the engine you have is still broken
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:54:04] <antimatroid>	it's the online engine that's been fixed
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:54:12] <rwa>	ah, ok
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:54:53] <antimatroid>	i posted in another thread about how the outcome should be calculated for neutral planets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:55:10] <Zannick>	only the client-side engine had that 1-extra needed bug
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:56:18] <antimatroid>	http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=392  my last post there explains how the engine should be treating it (I think, I had an error there earlier)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:57:07] <antimatroid>	the case where a planet is already owned by a player is straight forward, add incoming amount from that player, less the other players incoming, if it's less than 0, fix that and change the ownership
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:57:41] <a1k0n>	so if planet is owned by nobody and has 1 ship and you send 1 ship to it, do you get it with 0 or do you not get it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:58:02] <Zannick>	a1k0n: you do not get it, it goes to 0.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:58:09] <a1k0n>	i assume you don't, which is what antimatroid's post says
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:58:09] <antimatroid>	not get it, statement says ownership of a planet doesn't change when ship count is 0
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:58:10] <a1k0n>	makes sense.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:58:37] <a1k0n>	it should be interesting to see how the tactical play works out
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:03] <a1k0n>	i just watched a duel between bullybot and prospectorbot (which are essentially the same thing) and it's painfully obvious how much room to make it better there is
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:26] <a1k0n>	like dude could have fended off an obvious attack from the opposite side of the map so easily
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:29] <Zannick>	watch any game Max plays, on the website
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:30] <antimatroid>	i do hope the top bots aren't all pretty much the same again
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:40] <antimatroid>	did you guys see my post about the possible exploit?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:45] <a1k0n>	i like how some of those bost just spam dudes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:52] <a1k0n>	nope
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [00:59:54] <Zannick>	it is quite unlike the example bots
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:00:10] <antimatroid>	if you want to send 10 ships from p1 to p2 currently, you can do that as 10 different fleets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:00:20] <antimatroid>	i'm sure you can see where that leads
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:00:21] <a1k0n>	right
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:00:32] <Zannick>	antimatroid: for what it's worth, i having been trying to think of ways to avoiding checking the entire fleet list for every planet or whatnot
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:00:38] <Zannick>	s/having/have/
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:00:43] <a1k0n>	yeah, unless it coalesces fleets automatically
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:02] <a1k0n>	then there are only N^2 possible fleets per timestep...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:03] <Zannick>	it currently doesn't, but that isn't terribly difficult
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:07] <antimatroid>	Zannick: I haven't checked the fleet vector, is it adding new fleets to the end? or is it ordered based on flight time remaining?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:13] <antimatroid>	otherwise you can just read from the back
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:28] <antimatroid>	and update your fleets such that you have one per arrival time or whatever
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:32] <Zannick>	right, so i can easily find the new fleets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:39] <a1k0n>	there are some obvious bugs in the games on the website too, like, a planet that was taken over with 74 ships one turn will immediately turn around and send 74 ships out, which is impossible
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:48] <Zannick>	but what about the ones in transit? i have to do something with them to "remember"
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:01:51] <Zannick>	and that isn't obvious
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:02:27] <Zannick>	huh? if there are 74 ships immediately after taking the planet, you can immediately send them all out
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:02:28] <antimatroid>	no, it's not, i was devestated about not being able to iterate through priority queues
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:02:40] <antimatroid>	Zannick: not as you take it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:02:56] <Zannick>	ahaha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:02:58] <a1k0n>	no, it should have lost like 20 of them
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:03:03] <a1k0n>	i'm trying to find the game now
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:03:15] <a1k0n>	but yeah max just spams dudes everywhere, damn
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:03:25] <Zannick>	and well, too.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:03:37] <Zannick>	i mean, not perfect
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:03:56] <a1k0n>	forms a flow network of sorts
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:12] <a1k0n>	and then the game randomly terminates
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:22] <Zannick>	game ends after fixed number of turns
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:29] <a1k0n>	ahh
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:33] <Zannick>	winner is the one with the most ships
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:36] <antimatroid>	random termination might have been an illegal move also
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:44] <antimatroid>	if you make an illegal move, you love
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:46] <antimatroid>	lose*
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:56] <antimatroid>	although if both bots make an illegal move on the last turn, engine asplodes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:04:58] <Zannick>	no, illegal move will make you lose, but the visualizer will remove all your planets and fleets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:02] <rwa>	is a timeout really a DQ for your bot in general?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:14] <antimatroid>	yes, i got owned on that in the last competition
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:15] <a1k0n>	yeah, if it's anything like last year
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:17] <antimatroid>	be very careful
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:23] <a1k0n>	use setitimer, or equivalent
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:30] <rwa>	why isn't it just a loss of game?  that seems far more sane
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:41] <antimatroid>	i don't know, ask the organisers
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:05:47] <antimatroid>	i have tried and tried to convince them to change that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:06:02] <antimatroid>	i didn't even realise it was dq till it happened halfway through the tournament
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:06:03] <Zannick>	i think the idea is that if you leave up a bot that times out every game and you lose every game...you go way down in ranking
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:06:21] <Zannick>	so they suspend you, so you fix the problem and upload a new bot
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:06:39] <Zannick>	i don't speak for them, though, so i don't know
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:06:41] <antimatroid>	Zannick: if you time out on even one game during final tournament you are disqualified
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:07:13] <Zannick>	oh, ouch
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:07:34] <antimatroid>	if people wanted to troll the server by slowing it down, it'd keep making moves just before 1 second, not exceed the time limit
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:07:42] <antimatroid>	i think the rule makes no sense, but i don't set the rules
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:08:00] <rwa>	that rule makes no sense to me either.  a TO should be a game forfeit only.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:08:08] <antimatroid>	anyway, i've had enough of uni, i'm riding home
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:08:10] <amstan>	antimatroid: if we do notice stuff like that we are free to investigate the code
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:08:25] <antimatroid>	notice stuff like what?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:08:37] <amstan>	antimatroid: like bottom players consuming lots of time
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:09:08] <antimatroid>	yeah, okay, but please, do reconsider the dq on exceeding the time limit rule, it's very harsh
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:09:26] <antimatroid>	and i don't think it really hurts that much if people have the odd time out lose
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:09:48] <amstan>	i forgot what made us do that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:10:39] <antimatroid>	sillyness? :P
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [01:10:46] <antimatroid>	anyway, I'll be on again once I'm home

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:30:57] <Palmik>	Hi guys
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:34:51] <rwa>	hi
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:39:55] <antimatroid>	afternoon
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:48:10] <Palmik>	I have a question about the c++ starter's package if you do not mind. The questions are about line 12 in this snippet (c++ startter's package main loop) http://codepad.org/zX0ABEpy 1. What does the line 12. mean (I know what it does, maybe more precise question would be, what does it  mean if current_line starts with "go")? Can there be only one of these lines, ie. can I assume that only one line will pass this
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:48:12] <Palmik>	criteria (current_line.length() >= 2 && current_line.substr(0, 2) == "go") in the whole loop?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:50:22] <antimatroid>	Palmik: you really don't even need to worry about that function
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:50:52] <Palmik>	The reason I am asking this question is whether I could simply pass the playingField to the constructor of my bot and not care whether it can change during the while loop or it would be safer to update it with each iteration passing the criteria
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:51:47] <Palmik>	I guess the second (updating) is the way to go
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:51:56] <antimatroid>	i'm not entirely sure what you mean
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:52:47] <antimatroid>	is playingField your own object for storing data?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:52:59] <antimatroid>	you can get away with global variables to just store information in if you want to
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:53:07] <Palmik>	it's planetWars object as shown in the codepad snippet :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:53:13] <Palmik>	I just renamed it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:53:20] <antimatroid>	oh yes, sorry :P
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:53:32] <Palmik>	*PlanetWars
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:53:44] <Palmik>	no problem :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:54:10] <antimatroid>	my code has a rainbow unicorn attack and charlie the unicorn theme :P (planets == candy mountains, ships == unicorns, fleets == rainbow attacks etc.)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:54:35] <Palmik>	xD
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:54:47] <greghaynes>	If you want to instantitate a class per set of planet data (when "go" is sent) just reinstantiate the class each time the if(...) section is true and dont worry about if its required?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:54:48] <Palmik>	I'm not sure but I guess that the playingField is updated after each turn, am I right?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:55:11] <antimatroid>	yes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:55:21] <antimatroid>	I tend to just leave that function alone, but barely touch playingField
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:56:08] <Palmik>	Ok, thank you guys, that is precisely what i wanted to know :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:56:17] <greghaynes>	Are there any simulators floating around yet?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:56:43] <antimatroid>	greghaynes: you mean for playing across all maps?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:56:58] <antimatroid>	write your own? I just use bach files for running games rather than a command window
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [02:56:59] <Palmik>	someone released bash script on the forums

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [11:51:00] <antimatroid>	so say neutral planet has 10 ships, 2 arrive from player 1, and 3 from player 2
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [11:52:03] <Palmik>	which one of the three is 3 way battle? The jmcarthur's?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [11:54:25] <jmcarthur>	i have managed that for the other two, i think

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [11:55:05] <jmcarthur>	antimatroid: that's not true when neutral outnumbers the losing player, is it?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [11:55:26] <jmcarthur>	antimatroid: also, that's for the number of ships remaining, not the number of ships lost :P

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [11:59:31] <jmcarthur>	jmpespxoreax: hello :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:04:03] <phreeza>	amstan: whats the 3 planet map thing?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:04:38] <amstan>	phreeza: i am actually not familiar with the game, ask around
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:04:50] <amstan>	i think it's when each of the players starts on their own planet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:04:55] <amstan>	and there's a planet in the middle
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:07:00] <phreeza>	amstan: ah i see, thats one situation where the problem they were discussing might arise i guess
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:07:00] <jmcarthur>	i want to get started on my bot but i should really get some real work done
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:12:24] <jmpespxoreax>	"spare time" is key
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:13:55] <Palmik>	jmcarthur, I think you should add the costs to winner for the case when the neutrals are the winner :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:15:33] <jmcarthur>	Palmik: costs to neutral, you mean?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:16:09] <Palmik>	yep, I mean... they can win as well, can't they? :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:16:44] <jmcarthur>	yes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:16:53] <jmcarthur>	i'll do that real quick before settling down to work a bit

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:33:21] <Javache>	hi seigen
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:33:23] <Palmik>	hi
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:33:36] <seigen>	hey y'all
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:33:43] <seigen>	i've been playin around with it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:33:46] <seigen>	the starter packages, i mean
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:34:12] <seigen>	I was curious what people are doing for debugging on python?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:36:38] <jmcarthur>	awesome! http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:36:58] <jmcarthur>	from http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=424&p=2431#p2431
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:37:15] <seigen>	sweet!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:37:44] <Javache>	that looks cool
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:38:45] <jmcarthur>	it's nice to be able to watch your bot battle other bots in real time, for sure
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:38:51] <seigen>	if that works, that makes my python/debugging question irrelevant
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:38:57] <jmcarthur>	:)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:39:11] <jmcarthur>	it worked in the last contest
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:39:22] <jmcarthur>	this is just a new version of something from then
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:39:52] <danielvf>	TCP bot is cool
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:40:34] <danielvf>	*server
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:44:05] <jmcarthur>	so the server is ubuntu 8.04, iirc
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:44:19] <jmcarthur>	the version of ghc that comes with that is 6.8.2... :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:44:43] <amstan>	jmcarthur: how easy would be to upgrade?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:44:54] <jmcarthur>	amstan: probably not too hard, but i'm not an ubuntu guy
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:45:14] <Javache>	there exists an alternative ppa with some recent ghc
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:45:14] <amstan>	if you can find a deb that just works on 8.04, we'll give it a look
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:45:16] <amstan>	yeah
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:45:20] <amstan>	Javache: but for 8.04?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:45:29] <Javache>	amstan: no clue
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:45:47] <amstan>	that's the problem, ppas are usually even more up to date than the distros themselves
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:46:00] <amstan>	they might rely on dependencies that are outdated in 8.04
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:46:18] <Javache>	https://launchpad.net/~justinbogner/+archive/haskell-platform
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:46:24] <jmcarthur>	amstan: the haskell platform would first require a ghc 6.12.3 binary <http://haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_6_12_3.html#distros> followed by building the platform using it with the instructions at <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/linux.html>
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:46:45] <jmcarthur>	that's for a distro-agnostic build
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:46:51] <a1k0n>	holy shit, dhartmei already has a planetwars server?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:46:58] <amstan>	a1k0n: i know, eh?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:47:02] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: yeah that's awesome isn't it?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:47:14] <a1k0n>	i guess it prolly wasn't too hard to adapt the tron one
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:47:22] <a1k0n>	most excellent
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:47:33] <Javache>	anyone got a clue how to run a java program with that tcp-program?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:48:18] <Javache>	execv: java -jar dist/PlanetWars.jar: failed
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:48:18] <amstan>	Javache: i think he has a wrapper
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:49:10] <seigen>	i just put mine up there
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:49:16] <seigen>	i got a game against someone...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:49:17] <a1k0n>	oh his exec code is pretty lame
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:49:21] <a1k0n>	it doesn't allow any commandline args
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:50:00] <a1k0n>	Javache: make a file with #!/bin/sh and that commandline, chmod 755 it, and then run that with tcp
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:50:39] <jmcarthur>	amstan: if you guys got cabal-install installed with a recent version of ghc (should come with the haskell platorm, iirc), would you guys be willing to install library dependencies on request? it would be a simple matter of `cabal install packagename' for packages not requiring C libs. idiomatic haskell is fairly dependency heavy
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:50:48] <Javache>	a1k0n: yep, that works
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:50:54] <Javache>	strange, i thought i tried that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:50:58] <jmcarthur>	i hate to bring all this up again, like last time
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:01] <amstan>	jmcarthur: probably
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:10] <a1k0n>	Javache: it was trying to execute the file named "java -jar ..."
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:11] <amstan>	jmcarthur: i would recomend getting a VM, installing ubuntu server on there
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:18] <amstan>	and then try to get ghc working as you like it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:19] <Javache>	a1k0n: i know, i know
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:21] <a1k0n>	anyway i gotta go to work
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:22] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:25] <Javache>	i tried the thingie with run.sh too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:26] <amstan>	jmcarthur: then write us some instructions
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:28] <jmcarthur>	amstan: i will do that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:38] <amstan>	that would be the best way ihmo
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:48] <jmcarthur>	jaspervdj: any requests as i do this? ^^
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:51:55] <seigen>	anyone know if the benzedrine.cx site requires registration?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:52:12] <jmcarthur>	jaspervdj: i could go ahead and include some extra libs in the instructions if you know you will want them

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:53:19] <amstan>	seigen: ask dhartmei
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:53:23] <amstan>	not daniel, sorry
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:53:23] <jmcarthur>	seigen: i don't think so, but my memory could be bad
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:53:42] <jmcarthur>	seigen: i think it's just whatever name you report to the server with the client
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:53:49] <danielvf>	lol
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:53:55] <danielvf>	Yup, not me
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:02] <seigen>	ok.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:04] <seigen>	Thanks!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:11] <seigen>	i'm playing dhartmei right now, apparently :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:22] <dhartmei>	it's still only the starter kit :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:24] <jmcarthur>	amstan: 32 bit or 64 bit?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:35] <amstan>	jmcarthur: i think 64
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:38] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:40] <dhartmei>	i have no idea for a strategy yet :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:42] <seigen>	haha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:52] <amstan>	i really have to ask jeff for some ssh access to the servers
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:54:52] <seigen>	does it run forever, or what's the turn limit?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:55:03] <dhartmei>	1000 turns, but i guess that's too much.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:55:07] <jaspervdj>	jmcarthur: Haskell libs? please include vector ^^
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:55:09] <seigen>	looks like it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:55:16] <jmcarthur>	jaspervdj: yeah i was planning that already :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:56:52] <jmcarthur>	i really wish it was practical to have GHC HEAD installed as well since it's supposed to have so many improvements to things like fusion, but i think that would be a bit much to have side by side with 6.12.3
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:57:30] <phreeza>	which of the example bots is strongest would you say?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:59:08] <Palmik>	dhartmei, thanks for your work on the tcp server :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:59:31] <jmcarthur>	dhartmei: oh you're here! you rock
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [12:59:54] <amstan>	dhartmei: i added you to the medal of honour group for your work on the tcp
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:10] <amstan>	dhartmei: do you want a special rank?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:32] <Palmik>	wow, I did not think the bot from starter's package would hold for so long :D
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:39] <jmcarthur>	oh, another question... is the server still using wall clock time, or is it using cpu time?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:40] <seigen>	woot, i beat dhartmei's basic ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:44] <dhartmei>	thanks, can't think of a rank :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:48] <madsy>	Okay, I understand the recording data now. It's fugly ;-)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:00:49] <Palmik>	perhaps I!m playing against bot from starter's package :P
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:01:23] <amstan>	actually.. nvm, i cannot add ranks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:01:26] <seigen>	dhartmei: do you know how long it takes to refresh the ratings page?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:02:08] <Palmik>	You LOSE against dhartmei noo :D
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:02:21] <amstan>	can you guys give me a link pls?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:02:25] <amstan>	i wanna see

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:03:39] <amstan>	dhartmei: what's your backend written in?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:03:54] <Palmik>	dhartmei, perhaps someone already said that, but View Game gives 404
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:03:59] <dhartmei>	C++, the server.tar.gz contains everything
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:04:13] <amstan>	including the webserver?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:04:33] <dhartmei>	ah, the cgi's for the stats? i'll add them, if you're interested
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:04:51] <seigen>	dhartmei: also, is this using the recently patched engine?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:04:57] <Palmik>	I guess you are storing them anyway, so it will not hurt :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:00] <seigen>	the fix for simultaneously arriving fleets, etc?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:05] <amstan>	dhartmei: that's fine, you don't have to
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:07] <jmpespxoreax>	I can't find the http server at benzedrine.cx
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:23] <jmcarthur>	amstan: is --prefix=/usr/local preferred for a source build on the server?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:25] <Palmik>	seigen, it's fixed already?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:41] <amstan>	jmcarthur: that would be fine
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:05:45] <amstan>	jmcarthur: just go with defaults
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:05] <seigen>	Palmik: i saw a patch on the google-code page.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:17] <jmcarthur>	defaults are usually in conflict with package manager ideals, i think
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:30] <amstan>	oh
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:34] <Javache>	dhartmei: i would be interested in the cgi's
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:35] <seigen>	Also, i made some extensions to the python starter package that should speed it up a bit -- mostly turned the for loops into list comprehensions
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:44] <Javache>	i'm planning on setting up a small server for our computer group
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:06:49] <jmcarthur>	like default would overwrite the managed ghc 6.8.2 and stuff, probably
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:07:03] <amstan>	jmcarthur: uninstall it first then
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:07:22] <amstan>	i don't think we'll ever have debs if it's so out of date
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:07:37] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:07:52] <amstan>	is anyone interested in being a mod for the forums or an op in here?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:08:04] <dhartmei>	Javache: added
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:08:06] <jmcarthur>	i could be an op here
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:08:13] <jmcarthur>	i don't want mod forums though
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:08:15] <amstan>	jmcarthur: welcome to the job
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:08:23] <Javache>	i could op here for the european timezones ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:01] <seigen>	but are there any other Python programmers so far?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:03] Mode	ChanServ gives channel operator privileges to jmcarthur.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:04] <seigen>	i'm thinking no :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:17] <amstan>	jmcarthur: i'm not sure if that's persistent yet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:20] <Javache>	dhartmei: do you by chance know how to compile your server on ubuntu 9.04
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:43] <Javache>	i keep getting an error that arc4random is undefined, but the necessary includes seems to be done
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:45] <dhartmei>	just 'make' doesn't work? :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:09:55] <Javache>	nope
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:10:01] <dhartmei>	ah, let me check, i think that's a bsd'ism
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:10:05] <Javache>	server.cpp:207: error: ‘arc4random’ was not declared in this scope
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:10:19] <Javache>	man arc4random works, so it should be on my server too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:10:45] <dhartmei>	should be stdlib.h
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:11:06] <jmcarthur>	amstan: i don't know how to tell if it's persistent either
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:11:10] <dhartmei>	it doesn't have to be strongly random, it's only used for map picking etc. srand(time(0)); rand() % ... would do, too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:11:33] <jmcarthur>	it'd rather be able to deop and just op as needed so i don't gather extra attention
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:11:52] <amstan>	jmcarthur: it's persistent now, usually you /cycle
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:11:54] <a1k0n>	lrand48()
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:12:10] <dhartmei>	hey a1k0n, nice to see you back! :)

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:13:42] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: i read my backlog a bit. i'm glad to see that the last contest had such positive results for you!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:14:13] <a1k0n>	pretty mind-blowing, yeah.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:14:28] <jmpespxoreax>	it was a good skills showcase
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:15:27] <a1k0n>	i feel like i definitely have to at least show something for this challenge but i don't have any ideas yet.  luckily the deadline is almost two months away
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:15:30] <madsy>	Another possible issue. Does the planet ship production happen before or after an attack?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:15:39] <jmcarthur>	i like the extended deadline
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:15:45] <jmcarthur>	madsy: i think before
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:15:46] <danielvf>	before
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:16:21] <jmcarthur>	this game is sufficiently complicated that i have no idea what to try yet

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:16:30] <madsy>	And this is consistent across the different frameworks?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:16:45] <madsy>	a1k0n: I'm working on one right now.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:16:56] <a1k0n>	jmcarthur: your whole haskell UCT thing might apply no?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:03] <madsy>	With fast-forward and rewind.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:08] <a1k0n>	nice. javascript?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:10] <madsy>	And proper interpolation of fleet movments
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:16] <madsy>	SDL and C++
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:18] <a1k0n>	ah.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:25] <dhartmei>	a1kon: the new one is java, i'm rusty :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:31] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: it could perhaps, but the branching factor of the game tree is this one is so wide...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:42] <jmcarthur>	*in this one
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:43] <a1k0n>	i want a canvas one just so it doesn't... act all appletty and flickery and slow
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:17:52] <madsy>	a1k0n: So you don't instantly snap from one round to the next
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:03] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: plus, games can go on forever, unlike tron, so the stochastic search might not be so great
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:06] <a1k0n>	yeah, interpolation of ships would look nice
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:23] <jmcarthur>	yeah javascript+canvas would be awesome
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:23] <a1k0n>	jmcarthur: true but there is a round limit in practice
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:29] <madsy>	WebGL!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:30] <madsy>	:D
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:34] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: yeah i guess you are right there
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:39] <a1k0n>	so you can just optimize for (player 1 ships - player 2 ships) @ round limit
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:42] <Javache>	a1k0n: i'm thinking of writing something that uses <canvas>
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:56] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: still, it's a huge branching factor. i would have to weed out a lot of options just to get enough rounds simulated
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:18:58] <a1k0n>	yeah, me too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:19:29] <madsy>	I'm not sure how well searches work in practice. Most AIs will have some kind of random element, no?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:19:43] <jmcarthur>	madsy: mine almost certainly will not be deterministic
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:19:43] <a1k0n>	jmcarthur: yeah, at least try to solve for a few values of ships it makes sense to send (not so many as to leave yourself defenseless, and the minimum necessary to take over is easy to compute)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:19:51] <madsy>	Mine neither.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:20:16] <jaspervdj>	madsy: The random element will most likely be time

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:20:20] <a1k0n>	it seems like there should be a deterministic optimal strategy though
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:20:27] <a1k0n>	whether or not it's computable is the question
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:20:36] <amstan>	Javache: if it looks cooler and more stable than the java one, i will push to replace the default one with yours
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:20:37] <jmcarthur>	it's even computable, just not in the time limite
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:20:40] <jmcarthur>	*limit
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:21:07] <jaspervdj>	Javache: will you put it on github?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:21:12] <jmcarthur>	the optimal strategy is also very very likely to be a mixed strategy, too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:21:18] <Javache>	jaspervdj: sure
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:21:24] <jmcarthur>	much higher chances of that than tron had
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:22:40] <seigen>	Anyone got a bot they want to fight?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:22:55] <seigen>	i feel bad for beating up on dhartmei's starter kit :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:23:05] <jmcarthur>	to evaluate every possible next position of a game would be something on the order of planets^4 positions i think
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:23:36] <danielvf>	Which is doable, for smallish sets of planets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:23:40] <jmcarthur>	sure
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:23:49] <jmcarthur>	but not practical if you want to go deeper into the game tree
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:24:02] <jmcarthur>	you have to weed things out early to do that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:25:01] <jmcarthur>	tron only had a maximum of three possible moves per player per turn after the first turn, and most bots didn't even go very far down the game tree then
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:25:34] <jmcarthur>	so this is an entirely different ball game. you *have* to weed out bad moves early
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:25:46] <jmcarthur>	if you are doing a search algorithm
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:27:18] <amstan>	strategies similar to how humans think might be better
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:27:26] <jmcarthur>	yeah, that is very possible
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:27:30] <amstan>	get some levels of abstractions, like groups of planets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:27:41] <jmcarthur>	the nice thing about this game is that i just can't even guess
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:28:02] <seigen>	i think there are some key metrics you can maximize
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:28:19] <seigen>	like growth rate, total growth rate
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:28:32] <jmcarthur>	like a linear programming problem?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:28:38] <seigen>	kind of.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:28:48] <seigen>	but there are also some basic strategies i see humans use online
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:29:14] <seigen>	waiting until someone attacks a neutral with N+1 ships, then sending just a few ships to take it from them
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:29:24] <seigen>	after they've put in the cost of taking out the original ships.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:29:30] <seigen>	'poaching'
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:29:35] <danielvf>	Yup
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:29:47] <jmcarthur>	of course, that strategy might depend on whether it's better to do that than to attack the neutral at the same time as your opponent
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:29:59] <seigen>	well, you see the fleet go
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:30:11] <seigen>	and you can time your fleet to arrive at t+1
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:30:20] <seigen>	much easier for bots than humans to do that, i'd add.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:30:25] <amstan>	we should get the galcon creator in here
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:30:39] <jmcarthur>	i guess no matter what 3-way algorithm is chosen then waiting is better if you see a fleet move out
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:30:54] <jmcarthur>	yes we should
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [13:30:56] <jmcarthur>	does he irc?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:53:53] <seigen>	0_o
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:53:57] <seigen>	why would you do that to yourself?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:53:59] <seigen>	;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:57:51] <Zannick>	i would totally use python if i weren't worried about speed
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:57:52] <Zannick>	:P
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:58:04] <seigen>	heh.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:58:05] <Zannick>	i should probably switch to pure c
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:58:16] <seigen>	use py3k
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:58:53] <seigen>	plus, if you use good list comprehensions, etc., it's usually pretty good.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:59:00] <seigen>	i dunno, if that becomes an issue i'll move to C
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [14:59:27] <jmcarthur>	yay, planet wars becomes language wars!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:00:02] 	 * jmcarthur flavors the language war with some haskell sauce
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:00:29] <tapwater>	a haskell starter package would be nice :D
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:00:34] 	 * seigen watches his bot time out against dhartmei

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:01:35] <amstan>	is there a way to tag all projects related to the ai challenge?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:01:47] <amstan>	make a big collection of projects, on github
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:01:57] <jmcarthur>	dunno

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:04:46] <seigen>	:)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:05:29] <Scrap>	http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/ - that's not official right?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:05:37] <ulope>	Anyone know if they upgraded to a newer python or are we still stuck with 2.5?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:05:40] <amstan>	Scrap: no, it's dhartmei's creation
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:05:55] <amstan>	ulope: still stuck with 2.5
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:06:13] <jmcarthur>	Scrap: it's for testing and fun purposes only
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:06:21] <ulope>	amstan: Hm dang, I feared that would be the answer
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:06:28] <amstan>	ulope: if you really want to upgrade, get a VM, install ubuntu server in it, and try installing the new version(2.7)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:06:33] <jmcarthur>	Scrap: it has some nice benefits though, like being able to access debug info
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:06:44] <amstan>	ulope: if you get a neat way of doing it provide us with instructions
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:00] <Zannick>	2.6 is good
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:06] <amstan>	2.6, w/e
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:08] <ulope>	amstan: what version of ubuntu are you running?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:12] <amstan>	ulope: 8.04
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:18] <amstan>	64 bit
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:27] <Zannick>	the only things in 2.6 that i use that break in 2.5 is the with statement
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:29] <Zannick>	:P
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:36] <ulope>	amstan: hm ok.. thats quite old. Did you consider dist-upgrading?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:44] <amstan>	except Exception as e
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:48] <amstan>	that doesn't work in 2.5
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:50] <Zannick>	oh, right, that, too
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:07:54] <Zannick>	i ran into that yesterday
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:01] <amstan>	ulope: that's not a good idea 3 days before launch
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:01] <jmcarthur>	amstan: do you guys use apt-get or aptitude on the server? i've heard you're not really supposed to use apt-get after using aptitude for much
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:02] <ulope>	for me the biggie is signal.setitimer
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:05] <Zannick>	because i was running /usr/bin/python and not /usr/local/bin/python
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:10] <Zannick>	the latter of which was up-to-date
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:22] <ulope>	that allows microsend accurate timeout signals
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:33] <jmcarthur>	actually, i don't even know how much that will matter
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:45] <seigen>	ulope: i did some  tweaking to the PlanetWar code
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:49] <jmcarthur>	oh, it will matter some, nevermind
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:54] <seigen>	PlanetWar.py, that is
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:08:54] <amstan>	ulope: make a good argument on why you want 2.6 and instructions on how to upgrade, and we'll try our best
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:09:01] <amstan>	ulope: ideally on the forums
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:09:11] <ulope>	amstan: true.. and waht about just compiling a new version of python and installing it to e.g. /opt/py27 ?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:09:38] <amstan>	ideally we need to get a deb that just plugs in and works
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:10:02] <jmcarthur>	ulope: yeah, i'm going to be creating instructions on getting a more up to date haskell arrangement. you could do the same for python
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:10:06] <ulope>	amstan: Hm I will see if I can come up with sth.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:10:21] <jmcarthur>	i doubt i can do a deb. i don't even really know how to do that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:10:34] <amstan>	jmcarthur, ulope: you guys can share your findings, try to get it the easiest, most compatible way
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:11:02] <amstan>	jmcarthur: you could try installing the python from lucid or something in hardy
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:11:09] <ulope>	amstan: One other tnihg I have trouble requesting a password reset on the forums. The mails don't seem to get trough (not in spam either). Can you do sth. about that?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:11:19] <amstan>	ulope: yes... hmm
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:11:23] <Scrap>	how can I use c# starter package and still run bot fights in java?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:11:35] <dhartmei>	seigen: with 30k ships vs. 2, you should go into aggressive squashing mode ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:11:55] <Zannick>	Scrap: the engine and the bots communicate through io pipes, so language doesn't matter
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:12:14] <amstan>	Zannick: i think he wants instructions on how to compile and run it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:12:35] <Zannick>	oh
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:13:03] <ulope>	seigen: Yeah. I completeley rebuilt it yesterday. I will post it on the forums
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:13:15] <danielvf>	What is the TCP server using as an an engine, the javaone, or the python one?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:13:36] <dhartmei>	custom one, C++, possibly not with the final rules
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:14:20] <danielvf>	Ah.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:14:40] <danielvf>	I'm working up a javascript visualizer
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:14:55] <danielvf>	Just wondering what kind of data you are loggin.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:15:15] <amstan>	danielvf: Javache was also working on something canvas based
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:15:32] <danielvf>	I though he was doing a windows one?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:15:39] <danielvf>	Or is there a third guy?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:15:47] <amstan>	idk
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:16:04] <seigen>	ulope: would love to see it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:16:14] <seigen>	dhartmei: just noticed i was doing that... very strange
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:16:50] <seigen>	dhartmei: as long as my total growth rate exceeds the opponents, it sort of sits.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:16:53] <seigen>	and chills
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:17:37] <a1k0n>	dhartmei: do you ahve a turn limit?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:17:44] <dhartmei>	500 turns now

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:19:49] <a1k0n>	are you saving game states on your server such that they coul.. yes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:09] <a1k0n>	(could be visualized i was gonna say)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:17] <dhartmei>	not yet. last time i had the official visualizer and its format as template
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:24] <a1k0n>	yeah
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:32] <a1k0n>	now it's java and annoying to reverse engineer
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:39] <dhartmei>	if you build the visualizer, i guess you get to decide the format.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:56] <a1k0n>	why not rip off the official one again for now?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:20:57] <amstan>	yeah... idk why jeff wanted java
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:21:01] <amstan>	kinda annoying
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:21:05] <dhartmei>	it's easy to save the bot input on each round, and add every bot's moves, maybe add the player id in front of orders?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:21:17] <a1k0n>	it's slow and flickery and doesn't quite fit in its own applet frame
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:21:32] <dhartmei>	it's more data to store and read in the visualizer, compared to last time...

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:22:10] <danielvf>	It's much smaller than the log

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:23:16] <dhartmei>	with tron, you only had the starting map and each player's moves (one char per move), so the total was pretty small, even for longer games.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:23:33] <dhartmei>	now with 100+ moves, and each move doing dozens of orders, it gets larger...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:23:51] <dhartmei>	and if you don't store the state after each move, the visualizer has to re-create it based on the rules
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:24:42] <a1k0n>	http://ai-contest.com/game_info.php?game_id=4413852
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:24:50] <danielvf>	For the planets at least, you only need to store the ship count and owner
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:24:53] <a1k0n>	that's what the java thing parses

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:09] <Javache>	i've got the parsing of the gamestring done already
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:38] <danielvf>	Cool
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:42] <Javache>	maybe we should bundle our efforts
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:45] <a1k0n>	what is the format?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:46] <Javache>	probably more efficient ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:54] <tapwater>	wow, cool stuff danielvf
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:26:56] <a1k0n>	is that the map first, then colon, then.. moves?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:27:02] <danielvf>	Yeah, I'm parsing the log
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [15:27:05] <Javache>	a1k0n: yeah, something like that

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:19:17] <jmpespxoreax>	it is going to suck going through each forum posting considering that I have read none of it

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:22:13] <Scrap>	how can I compile a bot in c# and then run the battle in java? When I compile it using csc.exe it makes an exe file but the instruction to run the simulation don't work.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:22:39] <amstan>	Scrap: what are you typing to run the sim?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:23:34] <Scrap>	the command provided in the instructions. I couldn't find the documentation with  the details..

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:24:29] <amstan>	what's the exe that was generated by csc?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:24:40] <Scrap>	MyBot.exe
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:25:14] <amstan>	so... you type that in the console to start your bot..
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:25:27] <amstan>	but you want a simulation... so you have to tell the simulator how to run your bot

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:26:00] <amstan>	and runbot2 with whatever you want..
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:26:06] <Zannick>	... log.txt "MyBot.exe" "MyBot.exe" ...

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:44:05] <Zannick>	i figure the problem is more with the PlayGame server failing to run mybot.exe or failing to talk to it

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:49:47] <Scrap>	yes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:49:57] <Zannick>	you need to give it multiple planets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:50:11] <seigen>	Zannick: it should still probably be echo'ing "go"
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:50:11] <Zannick>	copy an entire map file in

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [16:53:09] <seigen>	Scrap: Here's what happens: when you run your compiled bot, what it does is wait for the engine to describe the world to it, then it decides on commands to issue, issues them, and then says "go" so the engine knows its done

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:05:00] <a1k0n>	well, snapping to turns is a useful thing to do
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:05:08] <a1k0n>	if your'e debugging a bot instead of enjoying a match
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:05:31] <jmcarthur>	so how many turns does the official server cut the game off after?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:05:42] <jmcarthur>	seems important for strategy, to me
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:05:52] <a1k0n>	it seems important to me as well
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:05:56] <jmcarthur>	and in fact, it directly affects the strategy i'm going to use

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:06:24] <mistabell>	what's the autoclicker for?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:06:33] <Scrap>	to make the match go faster
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:06:37] <Scrap>	to regulate the speed

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:06:51] <Scrap>	yes
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:07:33] <a1k0n>	hmm, dhartmei's server thing needs to output in game log format somehow
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:09:42] <jmcarthur>	amstan: do you know the answer to my question? what's the official max number of turns in a game? if it's not concrete, i believe it should be
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:09:51] <seigen>	a1k0n: or the visualizer can read off the engine's descriptions between 'go's
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:09:57] <amstan>	jmcarthur: i have no idea
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:10:09] <mistabell>	It seems like it's less than 1000
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:10:39] <a1k0n>	i guess it wouldn't be hard to make a perl script to convert
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:13:09] <jmcarthur>	i think it seems to be around 100, but i'd still like to know whether it will stay that way (and encourage it to be part of the game spec)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:14:33] <Zannick>	tournament_manager.py appears to use 100 turns
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:16:00] <mistabell>	sounds like my tests are about to get 10x faster

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:00] <a1k0n>	yeah if we only get 100 turns then the thing to optimize is not necessarily to win the game
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:01] <Scrap>	it says WARNING: player 2 timed out. in the middle of the game. Why does that happen? Both sides had the fleets at that time
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:19] <a1k0n>	Scrap: player 2 failed to 'go' in a second?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:25] <seigen>	hey here's a question:  if you run the java engine
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:32] <jmcarthur>	chime in with thoughts here, please: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=431
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:38] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: ^^
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:39] <Scrap>	a1k0n i don't know
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:50] <seigen>	it takes the map, two parameters (set to 1000, 1000) in the example, and then the execution strings of the two bots
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:54] <seigen>	what are the two numeric params?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:56] <mistabell>	my thoughts are 100 is too low
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:17:58] <seigen>	one is the timeout in turns
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:18:01] <seigen>	but what's the other?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:18:13] <seigen>	how long in ms before you decide a bot times out?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:18:24] <Zannick>	the first one is the time limit, in ms
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:18:32] <seigen>	thanks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:18:34] <Zannick>	so 1000 = 1s
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:18:49] <jmcarthur>	mistabell: i personally agree, but i'd rather have a concrete low number than a variable number, so i'm focusing on the existence of the bikeshed more than its color ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:19:34] <mistabell>	gotcha.  fixed is good
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:19:42] <Scrap>	I run the simulation and the bot always times out on the turn 176. how is that possible?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:20:31] <ulope>	jmcarthur: I hope it will be >= 200. 100 seems extremely few.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:20:54] <jmcarthur>	ulope: i agree. a lot of the existing replays seem to cut off at critical moments :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:20:56] <a1k0n>	it may need to be map-dependent
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:21:57] <jmcarthur>	if it's map dependent then we'd need to add the number of turns to the map format :\
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:22:06] <jmcarthur>	i think it's probably too late for that one

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:32:25] <a1k0n>	unlike tron, you could actually fake a group of players as "player 2" to the client and have it work
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:33:15] <jmcarthur>	yeah but your strategy would be thrown off a lot
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:33:21] <Zannick>	the programs all work with multiple bots
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:33:26] <jmcarthur>	FFA is a very different beast from 1v1
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:33:27] <a1k0n>	depends on how much you care about eliminating the other player
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:33:34] <Zannick>	you just need starting planets for them, and supply extra ones on the command line
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:34:16] <Zannick>	if you fake multiple enemy players as one player, then you only perceive yourself as ahead when you are ahead of them both combined
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:34:17] <a1k0n>	oh, i guess since they're going to be attacking, rather than reinforcing, each other, it'll confuse your bot a lot
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:34:27] <jmcarthur>	yeah

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:41:18] <amstan>	a1k0n: well.. me..
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:41:24] <a1k0n>	yeah besides amstan :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:41:47] <mistabell>	connected, waiting for game
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:42:01] <seigen>	ah, it paired me against dhartmei
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:42:12] <Zaph_>	jmcarthur, got any more of those tester accounts to hand out ? :-)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:42:26] <a1k0n>	yeah that's the problem with that server.  the pairings are fairly suboptimal unless lots of people are playing and have ratings
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:43:10] <seigen>	well, it disconnects after one play
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:43:26] <a1k0n>	right so you have to run in a loop or something
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:43:34] <seigen>	i also would take a tester account :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:44:33] Quit	mistabell has left this server (Quit: Page closed).
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:45:33] <seigen>	oh man, paired against dhartmei again
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:45:42] <seigen>	mistabell: sorry, i guess i can't play you :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:46:22] <madsy>	Is the growthrate number of ships generated per round?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:46:33] <madsy>	The Java code is a mess..
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:46:48] <madsy>	No offense to the author
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:47:00] <amstan>	madsy: i agree, lol
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:47:20] <a1k0n>	the C++ code is pretty funny
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:47:52] <madsy>	Instead of using a fixed coordination system, the viewer code enumerates the planet positions and calculates the extreme points.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:48:00] <a1k0n>	PlanetWars::Planets could be replaced by "return planets_;"
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:48:28] <a1k0n>	well, that's not a bad thing to do given how arbitrarily large the maps can be
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:48:44] <jmcarthur>	Zaph_: you have me mixed up with somebody else :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:49:28] <madsy>	a1k0n: The game could have used a fixed size with some sane values. Scale is relative anyway.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:49:49] <a1k0n>	not really
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:49:54] <madsy>	Like the extreme points -1 to 1
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:49:58] <a1k0n>	scale impacts the number of turns necessary to get from one planet to the other
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:50:07] <a1k0n>	so it's not invariant
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:50:21] <madsy>	Yes, but that could have been fixed with a simple scalar.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:50:52] <a1k0n>	a scalar derived from taking the extreme points to make it fit within the window?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:51:07] <seigen>	mistabell: want to try connecting at the same time?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:51:08] <a1k0n>	might as well just do that in the viewer rather than complicating the clients!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:52:25] <Zannick>	a1k0n: the entire c++ starter code was so hilarious, i rewrote it all for my own bot
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:52:43] <a1k0n>	i did that for the last contest and probably will for this one
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:53:12] <Zannick>	(and did away with that pesky iterate-over-everything-every-time-you-want-something

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:54:26] <Zannick>	no, i mean, a call to PlanetWars::MyPlanets() creates a new vector by iterating over the old one
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:54:28] <seigen>	do you guys even *like* programming?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:54:36] <seigen>	i mean, you could use python, and not have to worry about that crap
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:54:39] <Zannick>	same with neutral planets, enemy planets, my fleets, enemy fleets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:54:47] <Zannick>	seigen: but i want /speeeeeeeeeeeed/
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:54:54] <Zannick>	and i don't mean drugs

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:55:23] <Zannick>	it's not terrible

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:56:01] <seigen>	whatever.  it gets memoized nicely

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:56:46] <Zannick>	when i get back home tonight i'll continue with that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:57:00] <Zannick>	maybe get a basic starter bot going on it tonight
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [17:57:01] <seigen>	yeah, the interpreter is really good about optimizing list comprehensions

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:30:52] <madsy>	Not sure if I bother then.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:32:39] <jmcarthur>	aw
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:32:54] <jmcarthur>	you could just add animation to the existing java one

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:34:19] <j3camero>	madsy: if you want to look into improving the visualizer, you would be a hero to hundreds, and tens of thousands of people will see your work.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:40:15] <madsy>	j3camero: The parsing is okay, the game rules are not :-)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:41:05] <j3camero>	You don't have to worry about the rules with the playback format.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [18:41:24] <j3camero>	Each "frame" says who owns each planet, and how many ships are there.

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:04:58] <jmcarthur>	and i'm just going to have to run this again once the script is done to make sure the thing works in its entirety

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:08:34] <jmcarthur>	i won't be using any of the features the library provides aside from the parsing itself. i need a way to carry state from turn to turn. IORefs are an ugly way to do that. etc. etc.

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:09:06] <jmcarthur>	the parsing is all i really care about. i will probably just strip it from the starter and use that as my base

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:19:25] <jmcarthur>	amstan: i left my about me field blank so i could register more quickly because i didn't know how long registration would stay open

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:20:11] <Mathnerd314>	amstan: is it worth asking you to add my high school? I really doubt anybody else will come from it :p

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:01] <j3camero>	tapwater: okay dont bother filing a ticket. We know about the issue you're having. The workaround is to not use mac, or to use .tar.gz instead of .zip files.

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:30] <tapwater>	j3camero: ok thanks, I'll try that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:32] <mightybyte>	jmcarthur: I actually found out about it from the haskell.reddit post of your starter package.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:33] <seigen>	oh, bollocks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:41] <seigen>	thanks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:47] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: check the issue tracker. There is a topic about wall time vs cpu time. I'm still not sure what we should do about that. The purpose of the time limit is to guarantee throughput, not to make things fair for the contestants.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:29:48] <jmcarthur>	mightybyte: it's not mine

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:33:52] <seigen>	or... fix my code to not die in 2.5

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:34:29] <tapwater>	amstan: I did check that out, but I don't think haskell's supported in the current beta accounts

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:34:46] <Zannick>	weird
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:35:01] <amstan>	tapwater: i'm just saying.. haskell is one of those things that we'll definatelly support
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:35:15] <Zannick>	my python2.6 build went into /usr/local/bin, and packages to /usr/local/lib/python2.6

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:35:39] <seigen>	ulope: i have 2.6 and 2.7 running concurrently -- i did have to go back and fix the symlinks of /usr/bin/python

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:35:57] <mightybyte>	amstan: Yeah, I can't for the life of me figure out my forum password.  And the forgot password link didn't seem to work.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:06] <ulope>	Zannick: hm did you manually specify /usr/local as prefix?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:10] <amstan>	mightybyte: yeah.. forum emails are down, idk why
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:14] <Zannick>	ulope: i don't think so
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:16] <amstan>	mightybyte: i can do a manual password reset
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:22] <mightybyte>	amstan: Thanks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:23] <Zannick>	it was a while ago
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:36] <Zannick>	probably i just did a yum install python2.6 and it automagically worked
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:36:39] <seigen>	who submitted cheese bot?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:37:21] <ulope>	Zannick: yeah well the problem is that there is no 2.6 on the ubuntu 8.04 (since its from 04/2008) repository
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:37:47] <Zannick>	yeah
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:38:00] <ulope>	Zannick: so it need to be built from source

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:38:29] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: okay, so the issue with CPU time is that it's possible for wall clock time to go on for too long due to sleeping and waiting for IO, etc.?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:38:53] <amstan>	mightybyte: sent
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:38:59] <mightybyte>	amstan: Thanks.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:39:11] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yes. If we used only CPU time, we could be attacked with a bot that does while(1) {sleep(999);}
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:39:22] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: simple solution for that. have a small CPU time limit with a small penalty (lose the match?) and a large wall clock time limit with a big penalty (disqualification?) :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:39:30] <mightybyte>	amstan: Got the email.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:39:35] <amstan>	mightybyte: cool
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:39:40] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: I thought of that. It's a good idea.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:39:55] <amstan>	mightybyte: sorry about the paranoia, blame jmpespxoreax
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:03] <amstan>	lol
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:22] <a1k0n>	the upper bound on wall clock time could just be 2 seconds which should be safe on a loaded server
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:26] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: I think we all agree it's a good idea. Nobody knows how to do it. There is a thing under trunk/experimental/python_subprocess_cpu_time where you could take a crack at it.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:32] <a1k0n>	server loading was, IIRC, a serious issue for a little while last round, no?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:37] <mightybyte>	amstan: Heh, no problem.  It's understandable.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:44] <a1k0n>	getrusage?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:53] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: oh i thought that the technical details had been worked out already, judging from the thread on the issue tracker...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:56] 	 * jmcarthur rereads it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:40:57] <mightybyte>	amstan: Actually more secure that way.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:41:30] <mightybyte>	amstan: Oh, I had a suggestion.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:41:31] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: also consider this.... sleeping isn't a very heavy attack ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:41:37] <Zaph__>	Not sure if anyones noticed this, but my country ID in the 'my profile' page is invalid apparently

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:45:18] <seigen>	phreeza: debugging is for sissies!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:45:32] <mightybyte>	Pythonistas beware!  Haskell bots under development.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:45:40] <j3camero>	I wanna do limit hold em next contest. That would fucking rock.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:45:42] <seigen>	Although i dig the tcpserver making that so much easier
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:45:48] <j3camero>	Okay account creation is closing...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:46:29] <Zannick>	j3camero: haha sweet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:46:43] <seigen>	j3camero: Thanks!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:46:48] <Zannick>	(except i bet online casinos would worry)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:46:50] <seigen>	hey, is there a ticket for showing the most recent games?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:47:06] <seigen>	or a queue of planned games?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:48:08] <Zaph__>	how long would we expect to wait between 'compile success' and our first appearance on the leaderboard ?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:48:18] <seigen>	Zaph__: took me about 5 minutes.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:48:31] <seigen>	it seems to prioritize games for new entrants
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:48:41] <seigen>	<-- talking out ass
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:48:59] <javagamer>	Wait, did I just miss account creation again?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:49:06] <seigen>	oh bummer :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:49:23] <Zaph__>	hmm, been almost 15 minutes and nothings appeared for me
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:49:31] <javagamer>	Oh well, don't have time to make a bot yet, though I will on Thursday
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:49:35] <seigen>	Zaph__: haven't been any games in about that long.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:49:54] <Mathnerd314>	amstan: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=61 now with patch
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:50:42] <seigen>	Zaph__: i think they crashed )
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:50:43] <seigen>	:)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:50:50] <mightybyte>	amstan: Also, are you guys set on making the neutral planets accumulate ships at the same rate as the occupied planets?  Seems like it might be beneficial to have neutral planets accumulate ships more slowly.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:51:03] <seigen>	mightybyte: neutral planets accumulate no ships
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:51:25] <mightybyte>	seigen: Oh, never mind then.  I thought I read somewhere that they did.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:52:35] <Zaph__>	ok, now I'm on the charts
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:52:59] <seigen>	there you go
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:53:09] <seigen>	now, how long until your second game?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:53:24] <tapwater>	wow, my submitted bot seems to just crashing
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:53:32] <tapwater>	why would that be, I wonder
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:53:50] <tapwater>	works fine on my machine
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:54:17] <mightybyte>	tapwater: What language?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:54:28] <tapwater>	mightybyte: python
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:55:01] <seigen>	which version were you using at home?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:55:10] <mightybyte>	Hmmmm, no idea.  That should rule out segfaults.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:55:19] <seigen>	tapwater: followed by: did you submit your version of PlanetWars.py?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:55:35] <tapwater>	2.6.1
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:55:38] <tapwater>	seigen: yea
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:55:58] <Zaph__>	won my second game, dropped 82 points in ELO...  which is odd, since winning should never drop your ELO (I've been doing ELO stuff for 25 years)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:56:09] <seigen>	tapwater: did you use any 2.6 stuff?  the server runs 2.5
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:56:19] <a1k0n>	unless it was recalculated from scratch with bayeselo
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:56:28] <a1k0n>	and your opponents' elo dropped
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:56:35] <tapwater>	seigen: I'm not sure what is 2.6 specific
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:57:11] <Zaph__>	ah, perhaps thats it - didnt realise that bayeselo would go back in time and recalculate previous scores again
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:57:12] <seigen>	tapwater: also, if you submitted your version of PlanetWars.py, did it have the typos listed here?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:57:17] <seigen>	http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=399
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:57:26] <seigen>	2.6 has the 'with' statement
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:57:42] <tapwater>	seigen: yeah I fixed those typos, it wouldn't run on my own box otherwise
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:57:53] <tapwater>	no "with" statement used, either
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:58:17] <tapwater>	maybe list comprehensions are 2.6?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:58:24] <seigen>	tapwater: no
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:58:26] <ulope>	tapwater: no
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:58:33] <seigen>	but check the typos in that link
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:58:40] <seigen>	you can fix them in PlanetWars.py real quicklike
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [19:59:09] <seigen>	zaph__: how do you get three games and i haven't gotten two yet :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:00:02] <tapwater>	seigen: yeah, I fixed those a while ago; the bot runs fine locally
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:00:21] <seigen>	tapwater: have you tried it against all the example bots on all the maps?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:00:42] <tapwater>	seigen: can't say I've done that, no haha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:00:50] <tapwater>	seigen: I guess I'll go fish for some bugs..
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:01:40] <seigen>	they put a script on the forum to automatically run it against them all
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:01:55] <seigen>	it's worth doing to make sure you don't hang or time out under some conditions
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:03:36] <Zaph__>	seigen:  My code is awesome, thats how :-)  the server just knows it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:03:49] <seigen>	tapwater: here's the link http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=395&start=10
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:04:11] <madsy>	What's the best way to skip a character in the stream of an istringstream?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:04:17] <madsy>	istringstream::ignore(), from ios=
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:04:18] <madsy>	?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:04:22] <tapwater>	seigen: oh that's really useful, thanks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:05:55] <tapwater>	there are planets with zero growth rate? o_O
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:06:10] <seigen>	hahaha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:06:14] <seigen>	found the bug?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:06:29] <tapwater>	found *a* bug, at least
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:09:08] <phreeza>	is the number of turns going to be staying low like it is now?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:09:51] <phreeza>	if it is, it will most likely come down to who can grab more than half fastest, and then defend it.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:10:34] <Mathnerd314>	phreeza: if you can do that, you'd win in any case
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:10:59] <seigen>	not necessarily: you'd want to grab the most with the least loss of ships
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:11:12] <seigen>	where "most" is prioritizing the planets with the highest growth rate
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:11:44] <seigen>	Who is UloPee?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:12:15] <phreeza>	oh i'm first
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:12:17] <phreeza>	sweet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:12:36] <phreeza>	seigen: i'm guessing ulope
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:13:02] <ulope>	seigen: Yeah. Sadly usernames have to be 6 cahrs minimum :(
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:13:17] <a1k0n>	wow your bot owns
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:13:40] <phreeza>	ulope: except for max, aparently
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:14:13] <seigen>	oh no, my first draw!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:14:17] <a1k0n>	yeah wtf
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:14:51] <ulope>	hmpf.. seems something I did doesn't run on 2.5
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:15:02] <seigen>	does the view game >> link work yet?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:15:06] <seigen>	or is that still in progress?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:15:16] <a1k0n>	it works fine
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:15:24] <a1k0n>	er, on the official site i mean
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:16:17] <phreeza>	how can it be a draw?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:16:20] <seigen>	thanks, must be me
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:16:28] <seigen>	phreeza: i don't know.  I thought it went by total of ships
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:16:42] <jmcarthur>	phreeza: congrats on finally putting Max down
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:01] <phreeza>	jmcarthur: thanks
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:08] <ulope>	do you guys get mails after your bots have run?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:13] <seigen>	no
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:17] <ulope>	ok
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:22] <phreeza>	seigen: exactly the same number seems unlikely?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:31] <Zaph__>	seigen: The scheduler is odd - you're now at 5 games, will have to take a look at how it works because it's pitted me against the 3 bottom sides and nobody up high yet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:17:56] <seigen>	phreeza: yeah, so maybe it either a) counts planets or b) doesn't care.  there's a 100 turn limit
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:18:07] <seigen>	Zaph__: yeah, it did that for me the first three games as well
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:18:39] <jmcarthur>	does anybody else see a number in the middle of this map with no circle around it? http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4414056
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:03] <Zaph__>	100 turn limit ?  really  wow, most of my test games at home run 150+ turns against good opponents
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:04] <Mathnerd314>	jmcarthur: yes, circle with 0 production
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:04] <jmcarthur>	it's even attacked later in the game. visualizer bug i guess
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:10] <jmcarthur>	ah
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:16] <jmcarthur>	now i get it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:20] <Zaph__>	0 growth
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:24] <a1k0n>	jmcarthur: sure enough.  i bet.. yeah 0 growth
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:26] <jmcarthur>	ideally should still show a small circle though...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:19:36] <Zaph__>	the planets should be drawn with 1+growth radius, not growth
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:20:12] <phreeza>	i'm off to catch some sleep, thanks for the account j3camero
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:20:17] <phreeza>	i think this will be fun
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:20:41] <mightybyte>	Yeah, me too.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:20:42] Quit	rwa has left this server (Quit: rwa).
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:20:44] <Zannick>	every map appears to have a planet dead center that has 0 production
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:20:51] <Zannick>	it is also planet id 0
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:21:00] <j3camero>	Sorry about the 100 turn limit. I could boost that to a higher number. The idea there is that most games are basically decided after N turns, and we can better use the CPU cycles after that.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:21:11] <Zannick>	i think this is how the map generation makes the maps symmetric
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:21:36] <a1k0n>	j3camero: that's fine, but it affects our strategies so we should know what the limit is
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:21:47] <j3camero>	If the map generator is generating shitty maps that all have a zero production planet in the middle, someone should check it out, fix it, and submit a patch with an issue.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:21:52] <Zaph__>	agreed, we need to know.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:21:54] <a1k0n>	or it may affect, dunno
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:22:14] <Zaph__>	also, some maps have planets that are 20+ turns apart, which is pretty far in a 100 turn universe
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:22:18] <j3camero>	I think 100 is too short, given what we know now.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:22:37] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i am of the opinon that (a) 100 is way too short, and (b) the number should be standardized by friday
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:22:57] <ulope>	Zaph__: Yes. 100 seems awfully low. Most of my (test) games come in around 150-200
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:23:09] <Zannick>	i've been running 300
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:23:17] <Zannick>	but i also don't have a real bot yet
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:23:56] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: the max game length is probably going to change around a bit as the contest goes on. There is a tradeoff there between more games vs better games.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:23:57] <Zannick>	oh, aha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:00] <seigen>	j3camero: how does it decide a draw?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:04] <Zaph__>	waiting for my bot to play one of the top bots, will be intetrested to see where 100 turns gets to
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:10] <Zannick>	not all maps have 0 production planets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:16] <Zannick>	but the ones that do are dead center
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:24] <j3camero>	Oh, after 100 turns the game goes to whoever has more ships on the map.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:26] <Zannick>	er
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:28] <Zannick>	first line
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:28] <Zaph__>	j3camero: As long as you pass the turn limit and current turn number to the bots, it should be OK
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:32] <Zannick>	so probably dead center
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:37] <seigen>	j3camero: so my draw meant we freakishly had the same # of ships?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:41] <j3camero>	A draw only happens if the players are perfectly tied at the end of the game.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:45] <seigen>	whoa 0_o
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:24:53] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: but i can see strategies that rely on the number of turns to be viable
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:25:10] <Zannick>	i'll look into the map generator shortly
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:25:13] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: you are probably right.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:25:31] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: it is useful to know if the end of the game is imminent.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:25:57] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: the tournaments now are just for testing and for fun. It's not a big deal. We will worry about this issue closer to the submission deadline.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:26:48] <Zaph__>	guess we differ on the definition of "closer" :-)  you have to sort out the rules by the time it starts, you can't really go changing it a month down the track
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:27:16] <jmcarthur>	i'm kind of with Zaph__ on this one. timeout periods are one thing, but the number of turns in the game is very fundamental, IMO
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:27:39] <Zaph__>	unless, I guess, you warn everyone up front that the rules will be changing and they need to come back and rewrite their AI in the final moments
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:27:52] <j3camero>	Zaph__: why not? There is no way we can know in advance what set of specific policies we will have to settle on. If we commit to setting things in stone, then we also commit to not fixing broken policies down the road.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:27:59] <jmcarthur>	in retrospect, it may have been nice to include that information in the maps, but i guess it's too late for that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:28:05] Join	icefox has joined this channel (~ben@c-71-192-50-29.hsd1.ma.comcast.net).
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:28:22] <Zaph__>	if it's too late to include some info on the maps, why is it still ok to change the rules ?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:28:29] <seigen>	ok, my bot is crashing and the rules are in the air :) good time to call it a night
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:28:32] <seigen>	thanks all!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:28:38] <jmcarthur>	Zaph__: point
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:29:37] <Zannick>	okay, wow, well, there you go
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:29:44] <j3camero>	We could change the protocol to pass the bots the max game length. There are higher priority issues on the issue list at the moment, but I will do it if someone can submit a big patch.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:29:58] <jmcarthur>	IMO, for an AI contest, broken rules are better than variable rules
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:05] <Zannick>	the map generator does "random.randint(0, 5)" for the planet in the center
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:22] <jmcarthur>	okay, we need to get on that patch
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:26] Quit	seigen has left this server (Quit: leaving).
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:31] <Zaph__>	I do lots of programming contests, the beta testing period should be used to lock down the ruleset and the rules should only change due to extraordinary circumstances.   We've got a few days and a bunch of people to quickly turn around some changes before going live
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:37] <Zannick>	that would be why about 1/6 of the maps have a planet with a growth of 0
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:42] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: this is why we open sourced it. You can help us make the contest better!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:30:57] <tapwater>	bleh, my bot is still crashing
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:31:12] <Zannick>	i don't even want to make a patch for this; it's a one-character change :P
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:31:26] <j3camero>	Zaph__: You're right. I don't disagree. It's just that we're short of manpower. If someone submits the patch, we can fix it.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:31:30] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: what is included in an acceptable patch? engines only? would starter packs also have to be updated before anything is accepted?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:31:51] <icefox>	is it ok to put my code up on github or is that against the spirit of the contest until it is over?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:31:53] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yeah, we would have to update everything so that it all works.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:03] <jmcarthur>	ugh
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:04] <j3camero>	icefox: go ahead!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:13] <mightybyte>	Hopefully the game length restriction will be lifted for the tournament that decides the actual rankings.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:25] <jmcarthur>	well it can't be lifted entirely
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:32] <jmcarthur>	because games can go to infinity
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:38] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: if you want to do just a bit of it, I will apply your patch to a new branch. Then people can check out that branch and continue the work. When the branch "works", we will merge it into trunk.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:32:40] <jmcarthur>	it's different from tron that way
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:33:47] <Zannick>	so
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:33:56] <Zannick>	should the 0-growth planets be considered a bug?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:33:56] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: in fact, if you want to volunteer to take the lead on updating the communication protocol, I will give you committer access and you can run the branch yourself. Yeah?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:15] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i can't commit to that, sadly
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:16] <madsy>	Ookay.. I have the weirdest bug ever
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:21] <j3camero>	Zannick: yes, zero growth planets are dumb. Submit an issue (and maybe a patch along with it)?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:36] <madsy>	For some obscure reason, the compiler skips a complete object instantation
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:37] <jmcarthur>	my only potential source of income in the near future is this web app that i should be working on in the first place
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:39] <Zannick>	j3camero: this is a one-character fix, i'm just going to give a line number and a string
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:34:48] <j3camero>	Okay I am off to fix a shitload of issues now. I will be back tomorrow!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:35:20] <j3camero>	Zannick: sadly, it is more than one character. Both engines have to be updated, and all the starter packages.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:35:39] <Zannick>	uh...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:35:43] <icefox>	Zannick: why would a 0 growth planet be a bug?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:35:45] <Zannick>	this is the map generator
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:35:56] <smhanov>	Are there negative growth planets?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:35:58] <j3camero>	Zannick: oh yes by all means.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:36:07] <Zannick>	changing the maps is not part of this
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:36:09] <j3camero>	Zannick: I will fix it now, thanks for pointing it out!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:36:12] <Zannick>	and the engine doesn't care
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:36:19] <icefox>	0 growth planets are useful.  They are locations to store fleets
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:36:34] <j3camero>	icefox: the problem is drawing them. Its confusing.

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:37:02] <Mathnerd314>	smhanov: no, because nobody would ever use them
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:37:21] <Mathnerd314>	j3camero: yes, start with issue 61 :p
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:37:29] <icefox>	Mathnerd314: you could trick other bots to go to them
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:37:37] <Zaph__>	0 growth planets separate the good AI from the bad AI :-)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:38:06] <Zannick>	0 growth planets separate the bad AI from the AI that have a one-line check that the growth is positive
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:38:31] <mightybyte>	Zannick: Not true
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:39:02] <jmcarthur>	0-growth planets could be useful
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:39:06] <Zannick>	fine, it separates the AIs that check for it from the AIs that don't
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:39:29] <Zannick>	a 0-growth planet only costs you ships, never gains you any
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:39:37] <mightybyte>	Zannick: No, it separates AIs that are aware of the uses of 0-growth planets from those that aren't.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:11] <jmcarthur>	what if there was a 0-growth right next to a tasty planet with the oponent's main force? you could accumulate a bunch of troops there and effectively pin your opponent to that planet out of fear that you will overrun it the moment he pulls ships from it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:35] <ulope>	Why would you ever want to capture a 0-g planet? What gain is there to be had?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:36] <Zannick>	only if your opponent programmed fear into his bot :)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:38] <jmcarthur>	the fact that it has 0 growth is not so bad
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:51] <jmcarthur>	as long as you can still grow elsewhere
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:54] <mightybyte>	ulope: Position
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:55] <icefox>	Or a place to put ships half way between two high growth to go to the defense where needed
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:40:59] <icefox>	fastest
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:41:10] <jmcarthur>	yeah a 0 growth planet can also be a great waypoint
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:41:18] <jmcarthur>	you get a chance to turn around
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:41:44] <Zannick>	hm, i should upload an extremely silly bot
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:42:04] <ulope>	mightybyte: ok, maybe but depending on the initial "load" you still have to expend ships on it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:42:24] <mightybyte>	ulope: It's not about expending ships.  It's about positioning ships.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:43:19] <icefox>	This will be about bots that only attack+def vs those that attack + def + position
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:43:28] <ulope>	mightybyte: yeah I understand that, but if the planet has an inital "native" load of ships you will first ahve to overcome those while you could use the same ships to capture a palent taht woill produce more ships
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:43:49] <Zannick>	the game is actually "get more ships"
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:43:51] <icefox>	it might be worth it
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:44:11] <icefox>	the game it get more ships than the other team
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [20:44:20] <Zannick>	well, i am not submitting the bug, so if jeff changes it, he changes it

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:11:55] <j3camero>	It may take longer because the scheduler is kind of stupid right now.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:12:07] <j3camero>	Anyone want to fix the scheduler so it is not random?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:12:11] <Zannick>	lol cheesebot

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:21:15] <mightybyte>	Does the server start a new process for each bot every move or does it use one process per bot per game?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:24:01] <j3camero>	I am about to update the server max game length to 200. I will add a note in the FAQ about it, too. Will this work? We still may change it later, if we find that people aren't getting enough play. The other option is to light up more workhorse servers to handle the load.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:25:58] <zaphus>	If people read the faq it will help. The c starter package has 1000 turn limit by default, you should change those to match the rules
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:25:58] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i think at the least that the number should change slowly if at all, but be fixed for the second month or so
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:26:18] <jmcarthur>	and any changes to it should be stated loudly
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:28:48] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yes I agree. We don't want to confuse people or fuck their carefully tuned bots.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:29:15] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yes I think that the number should probably have settled down by the time we're into the second month.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:29:23] <zaphus>	200 turns can mean 7 minute games :-)  but I don't see a way around it other than a known limit and 200 seems a good compromise
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:29:24] <Zannick>	yeah, that server game matcher...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:29:37] <Zannick>	someone who submitted a minute after me has played 5 games, i have none
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:29:53] <j3camero>	Idea: I could add a note about the turn limit to the visualizer page, right under the viz area. I could also put a note there about other issues that are confusing, until such time as they're fixed.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:30:03] <zaphus>	I played max twice in a row
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:30:06] <j3camero>	Zannick: yeah haha it sucks balls.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:30:18] <j3camero>	We need a better scheduler, for sure.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:31:05] <Zannick>	haha, found another bug. profile_games.php doesn't put the user's name
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:31:46] <jmcarthur>	i am not good at watching a replay and picking out flaws
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:32:33] <j3camero>	Zannick: now that's an issue you can submit a patch for :-) There are probably lots of little shitty things like this lying around. Some pages on the website are still completely broken. Like the country and org profiles.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:32:41] <zaphus>	Maybe set a date for penalizing the rules, reset the ladder at that date - say 1 month from end.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:33:48] <zaphus>	Finalizing, spellchecker on phone
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:35:10] <jmcarthur>	i love that the scores are elo from the very beginning this time
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:35:24] <jmcarthur>	i'm a lot more confident in the scores than i was with the tron contest
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:35:29] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yeah elo scoring is the bomb. It worked so well last time.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:35:49] <j3camero>	Whoever alerted us to the existence of bayeselo is awesome.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:35:58] <mightybyte>	Why don't you use the scheduler from last time?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:36:05] <mightybyte>	...or at least use that as a starting point
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:36:16] <jmcarthur>	what's up with the scheduler?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:36:47] <mightybyte>	jmcarthur: See Zannick's comment above.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:37:04] <j3camero>	The scheduler just picks random pairs of submissions right now. It's pretty fail.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:37:11] <j3camero>	We gotta fix it before the contest opens.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:37:27] <j3camero>	Any volunteers?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:37:36] <mightybyte>	Seems like that would carry over from contest to contest pretty well.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:37:44] <Mathnerd314>	j3camero: which file?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:38:02] <j3camero>	If anyone wants to take a serious crack at it, I will hook you up with read-only database access, as well as committer access on the repo. You will probably need those.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:38:33] <j3camero>	Ah, forget it. You would also need to test on some sort of live environment. Forget it. I will fix it myself... some time...
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:38:48] <jmcarthur>	i thought tournaments around elo were basically supposed to just pick players that are close in score
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:38:58] <j3camero>	However, help fixing other issues would be greatly appreciated so I could have more time to fix the scheduler!
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:39:09] <j3camero>	Yeah jmcarthur that's how I want it to work.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:39:32] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:39:50] <jmcarthur>	does your elo score get reset when you reupload?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:39:52] <j3camero>	The best algorithm is as follows: player A is the active submission with the least games played so far. Player B is a random submission within ten ranks of player A.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:40:07] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yeah the slate is wiped clean when you resubmit.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:40:14] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:40:43] <j3camero>	It's not actually ELO scores. They are bayesian estimates of your elo score.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:40:48] <jmcarthur>	right
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:41:27] <jmcarthur>	actually, is it possible to show the confidence interval of your estimated score on the rankings page?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:41:33] <jmcarthur>	that might be nice
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:41:50] <jmcarthur>	or at least on the player page
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:42:30] <zaphus>	Do the schedule on least games in the last x hours, to stop people being starved

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:50:03] <j3camero>	I added some FAQs to the visualizer page.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:50:11] <j3camero>	Hopefully people will come across those pretty easily.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:50:25] <a1k0n>	j3camero: i see an empty white field with playback buttons (which are slightly cut off)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:50:26] <j3camero>	Also, phreeza rapes my bot, lol
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:50:59] <a1k0n>	man java applets are terrible.  no wonder flash won
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:51:02] <j3camero>	a1k0n: is it not loading at all? Do you have Java applets turned on? The visualizer needs work, for sure.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:51:26] <a1k0n>	j3camero: most of hte time the visualizer works but on that game i get everything but the actual game
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:51:36] <Zannick>	ahahaha
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:51:39] <Zannick>	my bot is losing
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:51:42] <Zannick>	as it should
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:52:51] <jmcarthur>	which one is yours?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:53:55] <Zannick>	bswolf
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:54:04] <Zannick>	it has a very simple strategy
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:54:26] <Zannick>	which appears to beat the example bots in 300 turns
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:54:55] <jmcarthur>	ah
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [21:55:19] <jmcarthur>	do you like working for google?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:32:02] <Zannick>	j3camero: like, did you know you can use random.sample(L, 2) to pick two unique elements from L?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:33:46] <Zannick>	though i suppose i can figure it out by looking at all the updates

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:34:18] <j3camero>	I have to go in and add 2000 to all the elo scores like I did last time.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:34:20] <amstan>	Zaph_: no, it's the same elo you find on the rankings page
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:34:26] <jmcarthur>	syntaxglitch: we definitely do

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:35:23] <amstan>	ideally you would do this with json..

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:39:42] <j3camero>	ihodes: it's up to you. The admins are too busy to make the starter package themselves. Make it, and we can probably get support for Cljure up and running.

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:45:55] <amstan>	j3camero: he wants to make the organization field to be a textbox instead of a select box, where you can write anything
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:46:39] <j3camero>	amstan: I don't think that's really what he wants. Then there would be a difference between University of Waterloo and Waterloo University. People would have trouble finding their school rankings.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:47:01] <antrimatroidUni>	for the website, could we see the number of wins/loses/draws for teach bot in the leaderboards as well as ELO rankings? Also, in the final tournament, would you guys be willing to leave a live leaderboard up while disabling viewing games?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:47:41] <j3camero>	antrimatroidUni: If we can fit the columns without breaking the site on some browsers, I don't see why not.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:47:46] <Zannick>	yeah, i have no idea
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:48:14] <j3camero>	antrimatroidUni: another idea is to display people's win/loss/draw count on their profile page. What do you think?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:48:51] <antrimatroidUni>	j3camero: I think the first option is better, but would live with that otherwise ;)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:49:12] <antrimatroidUni>	I think a live leaderboard during the final tournament makes it more fun for the competitors, as well as giving you guys way more time to run the tournament without people getting too impatient about getting results
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:49:29] <Zannick>	ideally a good algorithm would retrieve from recent games and the ratings board
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:49:34] <Zannick>	but i do not know how to do that
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:49:39] <inverselimit>	no games yet, uploaded about 18 minutes ago.  Normal?
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:49:54] <JCS^>	You could create a "basic start package" with just the game engine and basic instructions about the input a bot receives and the expected output format. It's not really important, but could help someone who don't want the given languages..
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:50:15] <Mathnerd314>	inverselimit: yes, scheduler is currently "pick two bots completely randomly"
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:50:24] <JCS^>	[it's not a real problem, since i have the delete key]
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:51:11] <j3camero>	antrimatroidUni: it's a decent idea to leave the leaderboard up. We really just took it down because it was embarassing listening to all the people crying foul play and accusations of rigging. We figured if we took it down until we had final conclusive results people would have less basis for such accusations. Maybe we don't have to worry about that so much now that all the code is open source for all to see.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:52:16] <Zaph_>	webpage bug:  The game times are shown with AM/PM, but the submission times are 24hr clock, makes it hard to compare at a glance

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:54:15] <j3camero>	bug killing*
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:54:25] <antrimatroidUni>	yep, that's fair enough, I think you should also consider extending the specified time for tunning the final tournament, and possibly even the number of turns before a draw, because at the moment games keep ending before a defininitive winner, and it's going to take longer for the scoreboard to stabilise this tme (i think)
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [22:54:29] <j3camero>	And with that I bid you all good night.

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [23:24:56] <mightybyte>	Zannick: Yeah, but I'm not talking about that specific strategy, but rather the possibility that multiple bots will converge on what is essentially "optimal" play and end up with drawish games like that.
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [23:24:56] <amstan>	jmcarthur: so.. did you want me to edit your "about me"?

[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [23:27:01] <Zannick>	it uses a reworked version of PlanetWars, but basically
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [23:27:13] <Zannick>	every turn it looks for enemy fleets that launched last turn
[Tuesday 07 September 2010] [23:27:28] <Zannick>	and attempts to mirror it

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:06:14] <jmcarthur>	even that doesn't seem so large though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:06:29] <jmcarthur>	seems like the visualizer should handle that easily if it is well designed at all
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:06:48] <a1k0n>	yeah peak seems to be 135 simultaneous fleets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:06:48] <jmcarthur>	unless there is some sort of crazy preprocessing necessary (like what though?)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:07:25] <a1k0n>	i take that back.  236
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:07:47] <a1k0n>	i just think the code is tremendously inefficient

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:43:19] <Zannick>	interesting
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [00:43:19] <antimatroidUni>	ie. is it ordered based on when the fleets will arrive, or does it just throw new fleets onto the back of the vector

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:09:54] <Zannick>	this has shown me a very interesting bug
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:10:09] <Zannick>	because my bot decided to send 0 ships from it that very turn

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:10:43] <Zannick>	http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4414223
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:10:45] <Zannick>	about halfway
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:11:26] <millertime>	there is no value pw.Production()
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:11:35] <millertime>	as far as i can tell
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:12:07] <millertime>	however, the tutorial says to check pw.Production(1) <= pw.Production(2)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:13:09] <millertime>	when i added that line my bot times out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:13:26] <tapwater>	millertime: pw.Production() probably isn't implemented
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:14:05] <tapwater>	I had that same problem
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:14:12] <millertime>	does anyone here have an alternative way to see who is ahead?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:14:34] <Zannick>	you could implement it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:14:44] <tapwater>	millertime: you can try some function that operates on production, fleet count, and number of planets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:14:49] <Zannick>	it's basically sum growth of your planets, sum growth over their planets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:15:50] <contestbot>	Top 10 players: phreeza(415), cheese_bot(376), zaphus(278), inverselimit(274), Mathnerd314(269), Max(145), seigen(-10), bswolf(-37), j3camero(-50), jdonland(-67)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:18:01] <millertime>	well we basically just have number of planets and number of fleets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:18:17] <millertime>	is that a total number of fleets for that team?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:18:26] <millertime>	s/team/Player
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:18:36] <Zannick>	you have the full planet and fleet info
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:18:49] <Zannick>	you just have to iterate over the lists containing them
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:21:41] <millertime>	you're saying i should sum the growth of all planets of each side?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:21:56] <millertime>	that seems simple enough
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:21:56] <Zannick>	that's what the Production() function was going to do, i assume
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:22:03] <millertime>	makes sense
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:22:07] <millertime>	thanks :)

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:56:44] <Cyndre>	evening
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:56:45] <millertime>	so if i want my bot to care more about the bigger planets with smaller fleets.. how would i adjust the formula --> 1+growth/numships
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:56:46] <Cyndre>	yea
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:56:58] <amstan>	Cyndre: yeah, i knew your name from somewhere

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [01:59:49] <Cyndre>	lots of names I remember
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:05:46] <icefox>	How dumb are the included bots?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:05:53] <Zannick>	so much
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:06:05] <icefox>	Should you be be able to beat them all 100% of the time before submitting?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:06:09] <Zannick>	not terrible, but everyone can beat them
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:06:15] <Zannick>	you don't have to
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:06:21] <Zannick>	it's a good test
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:06:33] <Zannick>	barring making your own more clever bots
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:07:15] <philipj_>	a couple people (myself included) just submitted the starter package as their first bot.  Even if you can't beat all the bots you could probably beat us.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:08:54] <antimatroid1>	afternoon people
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:10:38] <icefox>	I'm currently at ~99.9% winning.  Wasn't sure how dumb the bots were and looking to make some better ones or just grab ones other people have made and made public to add to my local test pool
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:11:44] <antimatroid1>	my bot creation is still in the stages of creating data structures, my actual strategy is still being worked out :\
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:11:52] <Zannick>	wow my bot is hilarious
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:11:54] <millertime>	i can't get past 60% for some reason

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:18:26] <millertime>	Cyndre - are you running ShowGame.jar?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:20:12] <millertime>	people who are winning against the example bots a lot: have you begun to take distance into account?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:20:29] <icefox>	yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:02] <millertime>	yeah, i was thinking that might be a nice thing to add
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:18] <icefox>	At least in the c++ starter there is a helper function already there for you
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:32] <millertime>	ah, i've got the python package
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:41] <icefox>	not that it is much more then a small function
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:47] <Cyndre>	java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "python MyBot.py" "python MyBot.py" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:54] <antimatroid1>	the functions in the starter packages aren't very efficient
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:21:59] <icefox>	that too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:04] <antimatroid1>	nor do they do very much
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:09] <tapwater>	right now python is sweeping the top 3 :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:23] <antimatroid1>	tapwater: the competition isn't even officially open yet :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:24] <millertime>	then i gotta step up my game!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:32] <a1k0n>	all right, i'm submitting my shitty bot next opportunity
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:35] <icefox>	well signup is currently closed so it is a self selected group :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:48] <antimatroid1>	a1k0n: just come in late to rape everyone ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:22:50] <Cyndre>	millertime: do I just need to downlaod the java package and move some files over?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:04] <antimatroid1>	i'm not putting anything up until I want to see how it goes against other bots
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:15] <millertime>	Cyndre: i didnt need to
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:29] <Cyndre>	running it command line?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:35] <millertime>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:35] <antimatroid1>	Cendre: yep
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:42] <antimatroid1>	or you can automate it with a bat file
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:48] <antimatroid1>	assuming you're on windows
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:23:51] <a1k0n>	yeah right, i don't think i'm going to do so hot in this round
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:00] <Cyndre>	nm, found it - I had room for the cmd prompt but the java window moved to a new page of toolbar
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:03] <Cyndre>	sorry :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:04] <antimatroid1>	yeah, but i suspect everyone is feeling that way
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:07] <Zannick>	hokay
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:11] <a1k0n>	but i also think the game is going to change severely over the next seven weeks
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:12] <millertime>	i automated it with a python program :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:14] <antimatroid1>	i think top 50 is going to be a lot more competitive
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:15] <Zannick>	i think i have something that might work now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:36] <a1k0n>	we def need a less shitty visualizer, this is just insane
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:52] <millertime>	i dont even watch that lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:24:53] <antimatroid1>	meh, i could live with the visualiser, just need bugs all fixed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:25:05] <a1k0n>	it takes like five minutes to load a frigign game
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:25:14] <antimatroid1>	did people ever decide how to run the 3 way battle?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:25:30] <a1k0n>	my bot playing against itself is  pretty funny totally symmetric spamfest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:25:30] <tapwater>	some other guys were working on a javascript visualizer

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:25:42] <millertime>	a1k0n: im not even running the visualizer and it takes that long. its the engine thats slow
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:25:52] <a1k0n>	well that too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:04] <antimatroid1>	i still don't know  how the tournament is goign to work

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:10] <antimatroid1>	games are goign to take a while each
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:15] <antimatroid1>	and i already think 1000 turns is too low

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:22] <millertime>	the visualizer loads right away once the game has been calculated out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:30] <antimatroid1>	i wish they'd let the competition run for a week with a live, updating leaderboard
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:33] <tapwater>	1000 is a lot, imo
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:26:57] <antimatroid1>	tapwater: it's not, with 23 maps and d (distance) turns for a fleet to get from Pi to Pj
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:27:03] <antimatroid1>	23 planets*
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:27:46] <icefox>	1000 turns?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:27:58] <antimatroid1>	i guess it depends on distances and growth rates
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:27:59] <a1k0n>	there must be some quadratic string allocation behavior or something
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:27:59] <icefox>	should be able to win in under 100
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:28:05] <tapwater>	antimatroid1: I'd respond, but I don't want to give away any hints :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:28:30] <a1k0n>	antimatroid1: er, they are going to let it run for nearly two months
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:28:43] <antimatroid1>	a1k0n: I mean the final tournament, not time to make bot
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:28:48] <Zannick>	i think the turn limit is 200 now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:28:56] <a1k0n>	it is pretty odd that they released all the contest materials without actually "starting" the contest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:29:02] <a1k0n>	antimatroid1: oh.  yeah.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:29:20] <antimatroid1>	a1k0n: I don't think they intended for it to be live, but then once people found it, it was hardly fair to shut others out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:29:29] <millertime>	a1k0n: i like it, cause i needed the warmup time :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:29:39] <amstan>	questions about stuff?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:29:41] <amstan>	i can answer..
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:30:01] <antimatroid1>	amstan: what's the current number of turns per game?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:30:11] <amstan>	the info is out for the contest because it was always like this
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:30:16] <tapwater>	antimatroid1: should be 200
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:30:22] <amstan>	antimatroid1: not game specific.. lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:30:54] <amstan>	the tron challenge, i preparing my entry 2 weeks before launch, it's just that nobody knew what it was before reddit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:30:55] <antimatroid1>	are you guys considering letting the competition run for a lot longer than a weekend?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:31:01] <amstan>	yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:31:22] <antimatroid1>	okay, I wont bring it up over and over then. :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:31:32] <antimatroid1>	well at least try not to
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:32:34] <philipj_>	I have a question.  I'm running my python bot against one of the premade java bots like the example: "java blah blah "python mybot" "java premadebot"
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:32:46] <philipj_>	and it says  "WARNING: player 1 timed out."
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:32:52] <antimatroid1>	you took too long to move
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:32:56] <tapwater>	oh I hate that warning.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:32:57] <Zannick>	"python mybot.py" ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:03] <amstan>	philipj_: if you type just "python mybot" does it work?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:08] <amstan>	if it doesn't, that's your problemn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:08] <Zannick>	you took too long to move or the bot didn't work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:10] <tapwater>	it could mean your bot doesn't compile
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:14] <tapwater>	or a runtime error
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:21] <philipj_>	yeah, the command is working
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:21] <tapwater>	or it took too long to move
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:32] <philipj_>	but it's not taking too long, unless there's a bug in PlanetWars.py
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:46] <antimatroid1>	try commeting out the contents of makemove?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:47] <philipj_>	because it says that when it gets to pw.Distance(p,source)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:51] <antimatroid1>	then see if that will play
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:52] <Zannick>	it's probably crashing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:33:57] <philipj_>	I have a print statement right after that that's not printing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:34:26] <millertime>	i dont think you can do print statements... i tried a couple times..
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:34:31] <antimatroid1>	nope, output is annoying, I'm using an output file for any debugging
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:34:34] <tapwater>	philipj_: if you're piping it into ShowGame, run the command without the pipe and everything after the pipe
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:34:39] <antimatroid1>	cause then I can analyse the whole game etc.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:34:59] <antimatroid1>	but if you do that MAKE SURE you take it out before uploading it, it's againt the rules to write to files
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:35:24] <icefox>	It would be nice if PlayGame would output any stderr that the bots output
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:35:45] <antimatroid1>	it worked last comp to use std::cerr
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:36:21] <philipj_>	anyone have an idea of what's going on?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:36:43] <antimatroid1>	philipj_: comment out all of make move, recompile, and see if that will run

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:37:51] <millertime>	so i'm thinking of getting a list of the planets that aren't mine and sorting it by size, number of fleets, and distance.. eliminating a few after each sort..
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:38:07] <millertime>	is that a horrible idea?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:38:34] <philipj_>	ok, I figured out the problem.  Stupid error, p was a planet instance, not the planet id like it should have been.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:38:52] <antimatroid1>	millertime: play around with different ideas, see what works best
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:39:03] <antimatroid1>	I would suggest playing around with pen and paper before actually coding anything
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:39:09] <millertime>	i'm discussing strategy :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:39:47] <philipj_>	However, is there a way I could have figured that out quicker??  I can't find out a fast way to debug :(  The error message only says it "Timed out" or it "Crashed"  is there a way to see what exception was thrown by python?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:42:02] <millertime>	only thing about a strict sort order... is outliers would get ignored..

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:44:12] <a1k0n>	which was that i can beat bullybot

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:45:12] <Zannick>	the last thing you asked was if there was a way to see python's exception trace
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:45:13] <a1k0n>	i actually changed my distance function to take planet references instead of ids
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:45:29] <a1k0n>	and made it static cuz why isn't it static?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:00] <Zannick>	that would be freaky
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:01] <philipj_>	ok, so is there a better way to debug than printing stuff and inspecting the log file?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:11] <a1k0n>	yeah but calculating that takes less time than fetching it from a hash table
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:12] <philipj_>	Yeah, that's what I'm doing too, caching the distance values
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:46] <Zannick>	*shrug*
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:49] <philipj_>	really?  There's a sqrt and a couple multiplies?  That's several more instructions than a load
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:46:56] <millertime>	how are you guys calculating distance?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:47:05] <millertime>	you said it's in the C++ package?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:47:11] <a1k0n>	a load from cache if you're lucky.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:47:16] 	 * millertime is sorry he doesnt remember simple algebra lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:47:27] <philipj_>	it's in PlanetWars.extension, or should by

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:53:00] <Zaph_>	yeah, I knew that - I was the one that suggested creating the Galcon account for his default game AI :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:53:33] <a1k0n>	does it actually use galcon's AI?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [02:53:50] <Zaph_>	yep, he ported it across to Python a few hours ago then uploaded it

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:06:35] <Zannick>	and in about 19 hours i'll be back here to work some more
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:06:38] <a1k0n>	no idea whether the output is actually correct or anything
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:06:38] <Zannick>	tapwater: yes

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:06:46] <tapwater>	Zannick: sweet!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:06:57] <Zannick>	er, 17 hours.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:09:33] <Zannick>	anyway, good night
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:10:29] <antimatroid1>	night
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:10:41] <phreeza>	antimatroid1: true, but is it an adaptation of the real game AI then?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:11:04] <antimatroid1>	phreeza: what?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:11:17] <Zaph_>	yes, it's a straight port/adaption of Phils code from the iphone game
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:11:34] <Zaph_>	or the algorithm anyway, I guess
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:11:34] <phreeza>	Zaph_: aha, nice
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:12:22] <Zaph_>	one of my mates at work reckons he can beat the top level AI in GalCon 9/10 times, so I'm prodding him to write a bot and prove it :-)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:12:31] <philhassey>	the iphone code is all in C, but i ported it to python and made a few adjustments for some slight differences in production / distances / timing in this contest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:13:11] <a1k0n>	very cool.  i assume the AI doesn't do any lookahead of the game state?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:14:17] <antimatroid1>	wait, what, is there a bot to test again that's reasonably intelligent?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:14:21] <antimatroid1>	where can we get it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:15:10] <phreeza>	ouch, the aggie is taking a beating :D

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:16:14] <antimatroid1>	i think they should run a second competition a month later (with people resubmitting bots) but for games with n>=3 players
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:16:15] <philipj_>	phreeza:  hey that's me and it's just the starter pack :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:16:39] <phreeza>	philipj_: ah ok :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:20:03] <a1k0n>	ha, issue 69

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:20:40] <tapwater>	lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:20:48] <philipj_>	nice
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:21:01] <a1k0n>	this is at least 10 times faster on long games
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:22:47] <Umsturz>	Is there a phreeza galcon game?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:27:44] <philhassey>	how many rounds does the server complete during an hour?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:28:01] <tapwater>	philhassey: not very many >_<
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:28:56] <Zaph_>	I'd guess 5-10 rounds per hour.  Long games could go 200*2 sec, 7 minutes (unless the server is still set to 100 turns, havent checked that)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:29:08] <phreeza>	Umsturz: not yet
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:29:11] <a1k0n>	ha, the python code is smart enough to build the turn strings in an array
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:30:39] <philhassey>	python is my language of choice
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:31:08] <Umsturz>	why is that?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:31:37] <phreeza>	because of the way the server schedules matches i think
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:32:24] <antimatroid1>	i have been meaning to learn haskell and python, but it's hard to find the time, i assume python would be pretty straight forward from c++
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:32:25] <phreeza>	but i'm pretty sure when it takes place, my bot will meet his Umsturz :D
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:32:56] <phreeza>	antimatroid1: compared to haskell for sure
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:33:06] <philhassey>	python just makes everything easier (for the most part)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:33:23] <antimatroid1>	i like being able to do pretty much whatever I want with c++
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:33:38] <antimatroid1>	and it being fairly efficient at the same time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:33:58] <philhassey>	i need to learn C++ better since that's what i've ended up having to use most of the time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:36:57] <antimatroid1>	I seem to learn something new everytime I do something
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [03:37:20] <antimatroid1>	but building up a game theory library has forced me to learn a decent starting amount

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:07:53] <antimatroid1>	fleets of size 0 provides a major exploit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:08:17] <antimatroid1>	because you can send as many fleets as you want from Pi to Pj (provided you own it and have the ships) on any turn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:08:26] <antimatroid1>	people can essentially spam the engine

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:11:06] <antimatroid1>	yes, hence it should be considered ideal to prevent it from happening
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:11:10] <antimatroid1>	that's why i said it's an exploit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:11:39] <tapwater>	it's not a very cool exploit either
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:11:41] <antimatroid1>	one could fix it by making a fleet of size 0 an illegal move (instant loss)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:12:00] <phreeza>	they are automatically executing other peoples code
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:12:02] <a1k0n>	you can also make 100 fleets of size 1 on your first turn, etc
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:12:08] <phreeza>	i think there are much worse exploits
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:12:24] <antimatroid1>	phreeza: like what? so they can be fixed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:12:30] <antimatroid1>	i don't mind people spamming properly
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:12:44] <antimatroid1>	but it seems silly to allow heaps of fleets from the same planet to the same planet at the same time

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:40:23] <dhartmei>	Javache: nice! do you parse the same input as the java viewer?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:40:37] <phreeza>	antimatroid1 drewrobb not saying its easy, but it seems like a possibility
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:40:39] <Javache>	dhartmei: we parse the gamestring
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:40:47] <Javache>	i think that's the same, yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:40:56] <phreeza>	some weird mix of knapsack and game theory maybe
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:41:53] <antimatroid1>	it might be linear, but there's a FUCKload of variables
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:42:00] <drewrobb>	i dont think the general solution is tractable
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:42:22] <drewrobb>	what exactly is linear?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:42:29] <drewrobb>	it would be linear without growth :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:42:40] <antimatroid1>	the growth is still linear
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:42:40] <phreeza>	the growth for example
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:42:42] <phreeza>	and the fights
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:43:36] <antimatroid1>	well, ignoring changing planet ownerships, but the growth rate is a constant number of ships added to a planet every turn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:43:43] <antimatroid1>	provided the planet is owned by a player
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:44:06] <phreeza>	yea, linear growth.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:44:15] <phreeza>	not logistic or anything like that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:45:13] <dhartmei>	Javache: e.g. you could fetch http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getgame?game_id=1283935099|dhartmei|a1k0n and use that as input?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:45:46] <Javache>	dhartmei: it only knows how to parse the playback_string for now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:45:51] <Javache>	but the rest could be added too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:45:52] <drewrobb>	yeah but you can have things like strategy A and B are independently good ideas, but the superpositions of A and B is fail
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:46:27] <phreeza>	transition from one rounds state to the next can probably be described as matrix multiplication
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:46:44] <phreeza>	drewrobb yes, not linear in that sense
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:47:23] <drewrobb>	ah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:47:48] <drewrobb>	it would be very useful to find that expression

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:52:57] <drewrobb>	never tried that, i haven't really done much computational game theory
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:53:48] <antimatroid1>	yeah, but I wanted something to play with and nothing good seemed to exist

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:55:41] <drewrobb>	i hate solving things by hand
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:55:57] <antimatroid1>	the code is bleh (although I've sort of learnt c++ doing this, so probably makes more sense now), and wasn't really easy to write your own programs using the library
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:56:04] <antimatroid1>	and input file formats were gross
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:56:14] <antimatroid1>	and i can break their extensive form algorithms easy as cake
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:56:23] <antimatroid1>	and it barely does anything
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:56:52] <antimatroid1>	unfortunately mixed strategy nash equilibrium in n player games is one hell of a beast, so I'm doing that as an honours thesis next year before releasing the library
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:57:07] <antimatroid1>	but that can be used for solving a lot of other equilibrium refinements
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:57:25] <drewrobb>	oh neat
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:57:55] <drewrobb>	were you also immediately annoyed when you found this contest way simultaneous play once again?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:58:17] <antimatroid1>	no, simultaneous is funner :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:58:43] <antimatroid1>	i think an ai comp for a differential chasing game would be cool
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:59:30] <antimatroid1>	although people would probably just end up trying numerical pde solutions i think
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:59:34] <antimatroid1>	dependent on how complicated it was
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [04:59:37] Quit	philipj_ has left this server (Ping timeout: 252 seconds).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:01:25] <drewrobb>	would you have to formulate that as an infinite game?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:01:34] <drewrobb>	i wouldn't even know how to begin with that problem
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:02:06] <antimatroid1>	think multiplayer optimal control theory
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:02:28] <antimatroid1>	so yes, continuous
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:02:57] <phreeza>	how would you implement that?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:03:04] <antimatroid1>	numerical methods
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:04:11] <antimatroid1>	in nd space would be mega
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:04:18] <antimatroid1>	but kinda impossibly to visualise
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:04:23] <antimatroid1>	even 2d would be kind of cool
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:04:44] <phreeza>	yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:04] <antimatroid1>	or just a robot unicorn attack ai contest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:07] <antimatroid1>	who can get the highest score
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:17] <drewrobb>	is there a good way to parameterize nd paths in some limited space?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:22] <phreeza>	i wonder if there is a way to formulate it so that the numerical solving isn't actually exposed to the bot
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:24] <antimatroid1>	no idea
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:32] <phreeza>	make it seem continuous to the bot somehow
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:37] <drewrobb>	like you could do so locally with taylor series, etc
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:05:47] <drewrobb>	then you could work in a nicer space at least
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:06:07] <phreeza>	drewrobb: or splines
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:06:19] <drewrobb>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:06:20] <antimatroid1>	so messy yet so awesome
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:06:39] <antimatroid1>	i actually had to derive the formula for a cubic spline in an exam last semester, lame!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:06:47] <drewrobb>	you would probably need to bound the movement based on a local taylor expansion
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:07:25] <phreeza>	but the ai yould have to update its tailor expansion periodically still, right?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:07:37] <phreeza>	so it is still discretized
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:07:48] <antimatroid1>	there are solutions for 2d games
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:07:51] <drewrobb>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:07:58] <antimatroid1>	i have a couple of dover books on differential games in my room
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:08:09] <antimatroid1>	but i don't understand much of them yet
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [05:08:14] <phreeza>	cool

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:21:46] <mtcbot>	which browser/version do you need for the canvas visualiser ? does not work in firefox 3.0.6 (Debian Iceweasel)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:22:05] <amstan>	it worked in chrome just now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:22:06] <Javache>	mtcbot: a recent firefox, webkit browser should work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:22:26] <amstan>	personally... if this doesn't work in IE, no big deal
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:22:34] <amstan>	graceful degradation... you can still use the site
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:22:50] <danielvf>	Maybe we should try http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:23:01] <amstan>	or that..
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:23:27] <danielvf>	Performance might be horrible though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:23:37] <danielvf>	So degrading to the java applet might be best

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:25:49] <amstan>	danielvf: philhassey was saying something about the colour scheme, apparently red and green were hard to see
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:25:57] <amstan>	does red and blue solve that?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:26:08] <Javache>	amstan: what would help for the end state, could you make the replay include some  final state?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:26:22] <Zannick>	red and blue is fairly traditional, too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:26:28] <amstan>	ok, good enough
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:26:33] <Javache>	could be just dhartmei's server, but an end state where all planets are taken would be very helpful

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:26:57] <dhartmei>	i can add an end state
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:27:02] <dhartmei>	that looks fantastic :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:27:04] <danielvf>	But yeah, red VS blue.

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:30:14] <dhartmei>	or, rather, are
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:30:36] <danielvf>	dhartmei: Are you combining fleets?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:30:44] <dhartmei>	not yet
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:30:47] <danielvf>	Okay
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:30:59] <Zannick>	combining fleets only works when the fleets are combinable
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:31:06] <Zannick>	if they're one turn off, you're out of luck
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:32:05] <danielvf>	Right, but still keeps you from being DOS'd by stupidness
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:32:13] <amstan>	we might have a problem, from what i see in the visualizer: lots of ship spam
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:32:32] <antimatroid1>	amstan: I said that days ago :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:32:53] <antimatroid1>	i think fleets of size 0 at least need to be canned
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:33:04] <amstan>	ew.... what?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:33:08] <amstan>	size 0?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:33:24] <antimatroid1>	you can send a fleet from one of your planets of size 0 yeah?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:33:40] <Zannick>	i figure tonight i can work on a patch to disable 0-size fleets and combine simultaneous identical fleets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:34:03] <danielvf>	Zannick: Great
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:34:26] <amstan>	Zannick: make it so it combines fleets too if they're sent in the same turn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:34:39] <Zannick>	unless someone else wants to, it's pretty easy and i'll be at work for the next 8 or so hours
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:34:47] <Zannick>	amstan: that's what i mean
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:34:57] <dhartmei>	i have to do this first, otherwise i'm sending >65KB turns to the clients, and my pipe gets exhausted :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:35:24] <dhartmei>	and maybe limit the turns to 300? after that, there are 20K ships around, and many fleets :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:35:44] <Zannick>	the main server uses 200 turns
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:35:49] <dhartmei>	ah, ok
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:36:07] <danielvf>	dhartmei: Can you turn on GZIP / DEFLATE on your server?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:36:08] <Zannick>	though that has been debated
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:36:16] <danielvf>	200 seems good.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:36:25] <a1k0n>	200 turns is just right.  proof: http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1283967055|ademar|a1k0n

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:36:58] <s_denchev>	I am for endless game with control of situations where we can declare draw
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:37:12] <ulope>	Thare are a lot of matches that seem to be on the verge of a turnaround wich are cut off by the 200 turn limit

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:44:01] <a1k0n>	yeah thttpd can totally gzip stuff
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:44:01] <amstan>	oh.. ok
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:44:10] <danielvf>	amstan: Thanks
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:46:56] <dhartmei>	merging is active
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:47:23] <amstan>	yes!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:47:26] <amstan>	much better
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:48:28] <amstan>	dhartmei: there still seems to be groups of ships
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:49:00] <dhartmei>	which game? only the most recent one is with that code already
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:49:07] <amstan>	i see
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:49:11] <amstan>	can you give me a link?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:50:46] <dhartmei>	http://10.1.1.2/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1283968107|a1k0n|ademar
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:50:53] <dhartmei>	er, www.benzedrine.cx as host
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:51:02] <a1k0n>	http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1283968107|a1k0n|ademar
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:51:06] <a1k0n>	does that actually make a difference?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:51:14] <amstan>	no, still groups
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:51:16] <a1k0n>	my bot isn't sending multiple copies of the same order is it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:51:44] <danielvf>	We'll need to move the numbers around, or drop the ship icons, and just show numbers
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:51:57] <amstan>	danielvf: nah, put the icon closer to the number
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:53:23] <dhartmei>	either a1k0n or ademar is sending multiples, i see them merged
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:53:51] <a1k0n>	in the stdout from tcp am i seeing my moves or my opponent's moves?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:54:13] <dhartmei>	you see the resulting planet and fleet list at the end of the move
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:54:25] <a1k0n>	yeah and then you see a list of moves and a go
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:54:34] <dhartmei>	ah, those must be yours
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:54:34] <a1k0n>	i think it must be my own moves and my bot is duplicating them  hmm.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:55:46] <a1k0n>	oh haha shit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:57:14] <a1k0n>	that explains why it goes nuts to defend an incoming attack
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:57:34] <a1k0n>	it fails to account for incoming defense handling an incoming attack
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:57:44] <a1k0n>	and just does that over and over doh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:57:49] <danielvf>	dhartmei: You can use the new visualizer code anytime now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [13:57:58] <dhartmei>	ok, sec
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:01:31] <Zannick>	haha
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:02:26] <a1k0n>	i need to rewrite this piece of crap but it isn't bad for an evening hack
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:02:36] <a1k0n>	this contest is gonna rule
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:03:58] <danielvf>	Yeah - it's gonna be fun.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:04:13] <danielvf>	I think the winning bot is going to be scary good
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:05:23] <Zannick>	and just plain scary
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:05:29] <a1k0n>	the low-tech ones we have now are already too hard for a human to play against
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:05:42] <Zannick>	a human could beat mine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:05:55] <Zannick>	though not always
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:06:03] <a1k0n>	mine requires a zerg counterswarm
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:06:13] <Zannick>	mine's a pretty dumb exercise
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:06:47] <a1k0n>	i can't wait to write one that can actually look ahead
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:02] <a1k0n>	but i should probably get to work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:10] <danielvf>	Lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:20] <danielvf>	I'm two days not working at this point.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:39] <danielvf>	I guess I'll go do that too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:40] <a1k0n>	i was trying to prevent this from happening but it already took over my subconscious
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:40] <amstan>	danielvf, Zannick: can you guys give me commit access?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:07:47] <amstan>	i would like to work on it too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:03] <Zannick>	i do not have commit access nor the ability to give it, afaik
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:15] <amstan>	Javache: ^^
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:20] <amstan>	Zannick: sorry, wp
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:25] <Zannick>	ah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:25] <amstan>	oh man... i get so confused
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:27] <Zannick>	no problem
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:08:42] <amstan>	and it is just me or did len(people in the channel) double?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:09:02] <danielvf>	amstan: sure, but I don't like I'll throw it out. :P

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:10:58] <dhartmei>	danielvf: do you use game_id, winner, loser, etc?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:11:07] <dhartmei>	somethings still missing, maybe you spot it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:11:29] <danielvf>	danielvf: names from there, not the id's
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:11:32] <danielvf>	Looking
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:11:40] <amstan>	danielvf: end screen, get the ships closer to the number, minor things like that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:12:25] <danielvf>	dhartmei: No closing script tag for the data
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:12:58] <danielvf>	amstan: Okay. FYI: I just moved the ships, some, though feel free to play with it.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:13:22] <amstan>	danielvf: oh.. and what about a CIA bot?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:14:43] <danielvf>	Yes, should it be here, or another channel?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:20:34] <a1k0n>	awesome, someone made a bot that doesn't suck

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:29:42] <amstan>	my first time with it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:30:08] <danielvf>	Not so weird, really.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:30:18] <McLeopold>	it would be nice if the planet number was displayed on each planet, for debugging
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:30:50] <dhartmei>	a checkbox toggling ship numbers and planet id, maybe?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:02] <amstan>	darn, it's php
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:04] <McLeopold>	yeah, that would be good.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:09] <danielvf>	amstan
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:28] <danielvf>	You can replace that tiny piece of php
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:41] <danielvf>	with just the data string
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:43] <McLeopold>	heck, maybe even some text displaying the orders for a round
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:47] <danielvf>	and go on.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:31:57] <amstan>	i think the old visualizer used javascript to open the data
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:32:09] <a1k0n>	McLeopold: nice bot ,btw
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:32:22] <a1k0n>	i'm tired of beating up on ademar

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:32:39] <a1k0n>	(who just beat me)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:32:50] <a1k0n>	my bot is very stupid, so i'm not
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:33:13] <McLeopold>	I looks like it just spams the universe
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:33:39] <a1k0n>	kinda.  it has some vague notions of the minimum number of ships it needs to hold onto to defend but isn't capable of any sort of lookahead
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:33:52] <a1k0n>	i just threw it together last night to have something

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:34:37] <a1k0n>	so i wouldn't get sucked in

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:34:41] <jmcarthur>	the visualizer is looking really sweet
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:34:57] <jmcarthur>	can we eventually replace the java applet with the canvas version?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:36:39] <ulope>	amstan: I noticed today that only about 30 matches are being held per hour. Is that a matter of you guys needing more servers / vms or just that you didn't get around to have the tournament run on multiple boxes?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:28] <Zannick>	i submitted a bug to fix that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:34] <jmcarthur>	a patch :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:37] <a1k0n>	is there a somewhat constant per-player rate of games?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:39] <Zannick>	er, a patch
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:45] <amstan>	danielvf: no need to replace for me: http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/canvas-visualizer/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:51] <a1k0n>	Zannick: against the tournament server?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:56] <danielvf>	Okay
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:37:59] <danielvf>	Great
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:38:06] <amstan>	is it me or is there artifacts in the visualizer?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:38:19] <danielvf>	amstan: Could be, where?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:38:24] <Zannick>	a1k0n: yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:38:37] <jmcarthur>	if the visualizer could just simulate one extra turn with no actions then the end game would look better
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:38:42] <icefox>	When you get "WARNING: player 1 timed out." does that mean it kills your bot?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:39:17] <danielvf>	jmcarthur: Ah, since that last kill is never shown?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:39:25] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:39:48] <a1k0n>	yeah, and then maybe pop up a statistics box like you see at the end of a round in (insert deathmatch fps here)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:39:54] <Zannick>	that's not a visualizer problem, that's the engine not sending the final state to the visualizer
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:40:06] <jmcarthur>	yeah, but the visualizer can still account for it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:40:07] <dhartmei>	i'm adding the last state to the data now

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:41:44] <ulope>	danielvf: could you maybe add an outline to the ships? Its a bit difficult to track them when they move over planets of the same color
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:42:24] <danielvf>	ulope: It's possible. Might just use a slightly different color for the ships.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:42:35] <ulope>	danielvf: or that yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:42:37] <jmcarthur>	dang, i just can't get a working up-to-date ghc binary on hardy. i'm thinking about... giving up :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:42:49] <jmcarthur>	i'll ask around in #haskell first though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:42:57] <a1k0n>	or maybe it's antialiasing the fractional pixel boundary
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:43:12] <a1k0n>	try rounding dirty regions to full pixels?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:43:48] <danielvf>	a1k0n: that could be it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:44:14] <danielvf>	amstan: What browser are you using?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:44:29] <amstan>	Chromium 7.0.516.0 (58618) Ubuntu 10.04
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:44:40] <coventry>	Can python submissions include extension modules?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:44:59] <amstan>	coventry: as long as they're present, yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:45:37] <coventry>	No, I mean can I write a C/C++ extension module myself, and include it in a submission?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:46:03] <coventry>	But now that you mention it, does the python install include scipy?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:46:47] <danielvf>	amstan: pushed possible fix, you want to test?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:47:35] <amstan>	hold on, key trouble
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:48:05] <a1k0n>	might want to round the right/bottom up rather than down
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:48:09] <Javache>	danielvf: all those params are ints already, I don't think that helps
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:48:29] <a1k0n>	aha
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:05] <a1k0n>	there's no way those are ints

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:29] <amstan>	nope..
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:30] <amstan>	fixed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:32] <Javache>	hmm, true
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:33] <amstan>	no artifacts
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:36] <Javache>	ok great then :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:38] <a1k0n>	woot.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:38] <danielvf>	Coolness
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:44] <a1k0n>	so what browser is that amstan ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:46] <danielvf>	Let that be a lesson to us all.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:49:46] <a1k0n>	that's def a bug
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:50:00] <a1k0n>	cuz you're just painting a black rect right?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:50:04] <danielvf>	Yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:50:09] <amstan>	a1k0n: was a bug, fixed; chromium 7.xx
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:50:21] <a1k0n>	amstan: er you upgraded your browser and that fixed it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:50:28] <amstan>	no, git pulled
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:50:50] <a1k0n>	what i'm saying is it's a bug in chromium that painting a black rect on a black background at a fractional pixel boundary leaves junk on the screen
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:51:31] <icefox>	:(  When you have a timeout it shouldn't say WARNING, it should say KILLING BOT.  Killing a bot != warning
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:51:34] <ulope>	a1k0n: maybe it interpolates the value across the pixel boundary?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:51:47] <a1k0n>	yeah, but interpolating from 0 to 0 ought to be 0.:)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:52:04] <ulope>	a1k0n: uhm right :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:52:11] <amstan>	how's this? http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/canvas-visualizer/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:52:18] <amstan>	changed the colours a little
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:52:46] <a1k0n>	now we just need galcon-style routing ships around planets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:52:57] <amstan>	philhassey: how did you do that?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:53:03] <a1k0n>	that isn't that hard
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:53:14] <Zannick>	splines, i figure
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:53:26] <a1k0n>	no
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:53:49] <a1k0n>	if the ship would be within the radius of a planet it just bumps it out along the radius and calculates a new direction vector
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:53:51] <ulope>	amstan: nice, thou the buttons look a bit odd, esp. the big "pause" one
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:53:56] <Zannick>	probably there are better ways, i am not a gui person
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:54:08] <amstan>	is there any colour functions, desaturate maybe?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:54:17] <icefox>	amstan: awsome
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:54:28] <icefox>	awesome even :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:54:45] <amstan>	it's not my creation it's danielvf's, i'm just playing with colours
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:55:09] <amstan>	danielvf: i hope that's ok
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:55:34] <ulope>	A total ship count by player would also be cool
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:55:37] <icefox>	Any easy way to total each side's ship count next to the names?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:55:42] <icefox>	hah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:55:44] <ulope>	:)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:56:09] <danielvf>	amstan: Trying to decide if I like the different colors
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:56:16] <a1k0n>	total ships and total per-turn growth
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:56:53] <amstan>	danielvf: it makes the neutral planets look more different than the blue ones
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:57:17] <Zannick>	a play-by-play featuring the fleets launched
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:57:54] <danielvf>	amstan: Yeah, I see that. For now I like do my colors better. I want it to look a little like a futuristic diagram
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:58:15] <a1k0n>	i like the original colors better also
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:58:56] <amstan>	danielvf: so, which ones you like? mine or original?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [14:59:06] <danielvf>	Original
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:00:07] <amstan>	ok
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:00:31] <amstan>	danielvf: ok, do you mind if i cover them to hex at least?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:00:43] <danielvf>	Go for it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:00:53] <jmcarthur>	think i might play with colors myself
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:12] <a1k0n>	i always go to kuler.adobe.com when i require colors
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:24] <jmcarthur>	kuler is really nice :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:32] <Palmik>	hmm... when I get report of invalid order in this format (1 1 0), which number means what?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:43] <Palmik>	I guess the first is the number of ships?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:45] <danielvf>	a1k0n: These came from http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/159423/Rocket_to_the_Moon!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:46] <a1k0n>	you're sending 0 ships from planet 1 to planet 1
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:01:53] <Zannick>	Palmik: from, to, ships
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:02:06] <a1k0n>	ah nice.  very kuler-like.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:02:14] <Palmik>	ah, si it's the same as the order of arguments in IssueOrder
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:02:18] <Palmik>	thanks...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:03:10] <a1k0n>	wow colourlovers.com is cool as hell
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:03:31] <danielvf>	Aye.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:03:34] <danielvf>	Coolest I've found
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:03:35] <Scrap>	Why does the line  double score = 1.0 / (1 + p.NumShips()); is changed to double score = (double)(1 + p.GrowthRate()) / p.NumShips(); ? Wouldn't there be a division by zero error if there is no ships on the planet?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:04:36] <a1k0n>	wut?  whose bot are you looking at?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:05:20] <a1k0n>	oh the examples
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:05:25] <Scrap>	yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:05:30] <a1k0n>	yeah, it would, but these examples aren't necessarily robust
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:05:55] <a1k0n>	in any case the score will be positive infinity so it'll just pick the one with 0 ships on it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:06:51] <a1k0n>	unless java throws divide by 0 exceptions on doubles, i dunno
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:07:09] <Scrap>	double score = (double)(1 + p.GrowthRate()) / (p.NumShips() +1); might be better
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:09:05] <jmcarthur>	most languages don't care about divide by zero on floating point
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:09:08] <jmcarthur>	> 1/0
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:09:09] <lambdabot>	  Infinity
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:09:16] <Scrap>	ok

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:39:58] <icefox>	Anyone know how to turn off the timeout?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:42:22] <icefox>	hard to profile when the profiler takes more then a sec to start up
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:44:56] <jmcarthur>	ew
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:45:28] <jmcarthur>	just use a language with a built in profiler :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:46:56] <icefox>	How would that work around tools/PlayGame.jar?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:47:39] <jmcarthur>	it would mean you don't have to sit there while a separate profiler starts up
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:47:55] <icefox>	?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:47:55] <jmcarthur>	and the timeout wouldn't really be an issue
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:48:05] <jmcarthur>	perhaps i misunderstand your situation
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:48:07] <icefox>	the timeout is already an issue without my profiler
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:48:16] <jmcarthur>	oh. something's very wrong then
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:48:37] <jmcarthur>	oh i see now. your reasons for profiling are to figure out what's taking so long?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:48:49] <icefox>	yah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:48:56] <icefox>	what do you use profilers for?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:49:12] <jmcarthur>	well, for speeding things up, but i didn't realize your bot was going slow enough to be timing out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:49:23] <icefox>	only vary rarely
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:49:26] <Scrap>	 there are lines like these in an example - boolean attackMode = false; if (pw.Production(1) >= pw.Production(2)) {. The "production" is not in the PlanetWars.java, Planet.java files and the attackMode variable is not used. Why is it like that? What is "production"?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:49:34] <jmcarthur>	*for analyzing performance characteristics in order to speed it up
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:50:11] 	 * jmcarthur shrugs
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:50:37] <icefox>	so it would be nice if PlayGame's warning was really just that, a warning of if there was an environment variable to turn it from a error into a warning
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:52:46] <jmcarthur>	i don't even see PlayGame in the repository...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:53:55] <icefox>	tools/PlayGame.jar in the starter package
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:54:17] <jmcarthur>	yeah, a .jar
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:54:20] <jmcarthur>	where's the .java?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:55:06] <jmcarthur>	ah the files are under viz
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [15:55:53] <jmcarthur>	icefox: i think the relevant code is in this file http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/viz/Engine.java
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:00:22] <Zannick>	icefox: the first of the large numbers you supply to the PlayGame.jar is the timeout, you can add a few zeroes

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:01:17] <icefox>	Zannick: thanks, I guess the first one was number of turns as they were both 1000
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:01:38] <Zannick>	no, the first is timeout, the second it number of turns
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:01:44] <tigreton>	for when php?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:01:46] <icefox>	yup, makes sense now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:02:50] <jmcarthur>	heh i clearly haven't even used the simulator yet
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:02:59] <jmcarthur>	tigreton: php?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:04:08] <Scrap>	Is there any decent documentation on the available data?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:04:10] <tigreton>	yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:04:18] <tigreton>	jmcarthur
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:04:31] <tigreton>	i love php and can't programm the bot with php
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:05:00] <tigreton>	or i dont know how
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:05:10] <tigreton>	in forum i read that now it impossible
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:16] <jmcarthur>	tigreton: if you want to use php to program your bot you will have to write up some instructions for the maintainers on how to get it working on the server and also maybe create a starter package
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:31] <jmcarthur>	or you could just learn another language
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:36] <tigreton>	just
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:40] <jmcarthur>	tigreton: ruby and python might be similar enough to php for you
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:42] <tigreton>	in les than 1 month
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:49] <jmcarthur>	the contest is over 2 months
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:06:51] <tigreton>	and i saw java and is "easy"
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:07:04] <tigreton>	but don't know how to do a starter pack
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:07:12] <tigreton>	dont have documentation about it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:07:20] <jmcarthur>	http://ai-contest.com/quickstart.php
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:07:51] <jmcarthur>	i would recommend ruby or python if you are familiar with php
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:07:58] <jmcarthur>	i think there is a ruby start in the forums somewhere
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:08:01] <jmcarthur>	*starter
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:08:45] <jmcarthur>	this is all assuming of course that you don't assist the maintainers in getting php up and running in a suitable manner for your bot on the server

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:18:53] <a1k0n>	icefox: PlayGame.jar takes a commandline argument for the timeout, you can just bump it up from 1000ms
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:19:04] <icefox>	yah got it :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:19:07] <a1k0n>	(skimming the backlog, sorry)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:20:34] <icefox>	turns out most of the  time the c++ PlanetWars string parser code eats up all the time.  I'll look to see if I can't improve that later
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:28:27] <a1k0n>	oh nice.  yeah i was thinking of discarding that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:28:32] <a1k0n>	maybe i'll just use flex
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:28:38] <a1k0n>	or.. scanf
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:28:47] <Scrap>	does anyone have the binaries for windows (www.benzedrine.cx) ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:29:13] <a1k0n>	icefox: are you compiling with optimization at least?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:29:21] <icefox>	yup
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:29:35] <icefox>	we should add that to the default c++ makefile :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:29:49] <icefox>	and Wall
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:32:51] <ratatata>	are the games on website played on PlayGame.jar or is there a different engine?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:33:54] <hornairs>	does anyone have any suggestions for introductory reading topics or books that would offer some guidance for this year's challenge?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:34:15] <a1k0n>	ratatata: all the code is here: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/checkout
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:35:12] <a1k0n>	i suspect linear algebra might play a role this year but that remains to be seen.  i don't think there's been enough theory development (in public) yet for a recommendation
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:36:11] <a1k0n>	hornairs: all i did with my bot so far is try to figure out how many ships my opponent could send at me, and is currently sending at me, and try to expand as much as possible under that constraint

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:37:27] <hornairs>	a1k0n: i see i see, thanks for the tips. im in a linalg class right now haha. i suspect there might be some interesting angles to take with heatmapping and a lot of optimization to be done with minimum flight time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:38:12] <Utkarsh>	is it possible to get an account now, to test out our bots? (I read somewhere in the forums)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:38:15] <a1k0n>	the first thing i did was try to solve the system of equations defining the minimum number of ships necessary for defense on each planet for each player, but it results in a singular matrix so there's no simple optimum
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:38:34] <a1k0n>	Utkarsh: whenever j3camero comes back he might open it up again
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:39:37] <a1k0n>	i can't believe my bot has a 90% win rate, i suspect that won't last long

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:41:23] <jmcarthur>	i'm not even sure whether a map size makes much sense/difference

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:41:35] <a1k0n>	yeah, why does it matter how big the map is?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:41:40] <a1k0n>	there isn't a constant map size though, no
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:41:47] <a1k0n>	and its maximum is unspecified
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:41:56] <phreeza>	a1k0n: i'm going to try to compile the tcp client now, you still waiting for someone to play?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:42:03] <a1k0n>	phreeza: bring it on
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:42:04] <MDM>	my bot is going to normalize the planet vectors to determine a more accurate average for detecting who's has a strategic advantage
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:42:10] <a1k0n>	i've been beating up ademar for the last 3 hours or whatever
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:42:17] <MDM>	so I need to know map size

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:42:28] <jmcarthur>	MDM: why not just use the max distance in the map?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:42:51] <a1k0n>	the space is effectively non-euclidean; planet distances are ceil(euclidean distance)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:43:11] <a1k0n>	it doesn't necessarily satisfy the triangle inequality that way
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:43:13] <MDM>	because max distance implies the size of the map is dynamic, i need to make sure I don't need to do real-time detection for map size
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:43:31] <a1k0n>	well it's not like new planets are going to appear during a game
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:43:57] <a1k0n>	so anyway what i'm saying is you should probably think of the map as a general graph, not necessarily a plane
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:44:24] <MDM>	hmmm

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [16:46:03] <a1k0n>	oh true, it's just constrained by the number of ships that exist

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:16:55] <phreeza>	yea didn't stand a chance
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:17:02] <phreeza>	back to the drawing board :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:17:16] <a1k0n>	awesome let's see whether albert or a1k0n is better

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:19:51] <JensTi>	benzedrine doesn't work corectly does it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:19:58] <a1k0n>	it does now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:20:07] <phreeza>	yea you too :D
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:20:07] <a1k0n>	the killing-your-own-dudes bug got fixed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:20:26] <javagamer>	Can you play more than 2 bots at a time?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:20:39] <JensTi>	oh ok, 2010-09-08 21:17:42 still showed that bug
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:20:40] <a1k0n>	maybe we could set up an alternate server for that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:21:04] <a1k0n>	JensTi: what?  UTC?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:21:15] <JensTi>	uhu

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:23:38] <JensTi>	sorry, my bad
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:23:38] <a1k0n>	are you talking about the 77->61 transition?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:23:42] <JensTi>	you were also sending out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:24:20] <Zannick>	i see something amiss
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:24:47] <a1k0n>	when/where?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:24:47] <Zannick>	turn 8, a ship of 28 is about to take a neutral planet of 27.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:25:00] <Zannick>	turn 9, the planet is taken, has 5 ships
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:25:25] <a1k0n>	oh, the growth should happen before, not after, the takeover
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:25:28] <Zannick>	is the benzedrine engine adding growth before or after ship movement?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:26:06] <JensTi>	also friend just told me the official engine doesnt allow 2 planets to be overtaken at the same turn?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:26:28] <Zannick>	i've read the official engine, that shouldn't be true
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:26:45] <a1k0n>	dhartmei's server source is updated on there
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:27:15] <a1k0n>	yes, it's adding growth last instead of first
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:27:36] <a1k0n>	easy fix
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:31:06] <jmcarthur>	is there actually any advantage in sending forces to attack neutrals as they generate, keeping the number of forces at your planet constant? i've been seeing that happen a lot. is that really better than just waiting until you have enough forces to do it in one fleet?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:31:48] <a1k0n>	if you have no actual ability to look ahead in time, then it is, otherwise probably not
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:31:58] <Zannick>	some people might just be doing it to make it more difficult to examine all the fleets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:08] <a1k0n>	my bot does it because it is stupid
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:11] <jmcarthur>	heh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:17] <jmcarthur>	i do think it looks pretty :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:19] <a1k0n>	but really
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:21] <jmcarthur>	at least in the new visualizer
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:22] <Zannick>	my bot does it because other bots do it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:26] <jmcarthur>	lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:35] <Zannick>	(have you seen my bot?)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:38] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:32:39] <a1k0n>	what's happening is that it decides how many ships it needs to have on each planet, and any extra are reallocated where they're needed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:33:15] <jmcarthur>	ah, so it's just a "i want this many over there, and i don't have that yet, so send some ships immediately"?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:33:43] <a1k0n>	yeah.  it's actually "i have 50 ships i don't need right here.  where can i put them?" so it really is biased towards sending stuff out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:33:58] <jmcarthur>	ah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:34:19] <a1k0n>	which makes it extremely vulnerable to attack if it guesses wrong on its defense needs
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:35:24] <JensTi>	I think it's bad to send little packets out, because you weaken the neutral planet, and then the enemy can easily take over
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:35:59] <a1k0n>	yeah probably.  and spending ships on neutral planets before taking it over actually gives the enemy an advantage
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:36:19] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:36:21] <a1k0n>	i might try a variant that doesn't do that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:36:38] <jmcarthur>	i'm kind of relieved that it's bad to do that, because i find the spam bots a little annoying to study
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:37:49] <tapwater>	I hate python
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:38:06] <tapwater>	I just spent an hour for a stupid typo
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:39:47] <jmcarthur>	haha
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:39:56] <jmcarthur>	wait that's not funny
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:40:05] <tapwater>	lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:40:08] <tapwater>	in retrospect it is
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:40:22] <jmcarthur>	well, sort of. i laughed because you've been talking about haskell this whole time and then you have a python typo that the interpreter didn't catch for you :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:40:29] <Zannick>	i did that all the time in a several-hundred line codebase
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:40:54] <Zannick>	i use pychecker now :P

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:42:29] <jmcarthur>	yeah just what i need to do... help a1k0n
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:42:43] <Zannick>	there's a balance somewhere.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:42:44] <jmcarthur>	:)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:43:13] <Zannick>	spamming yourself or your opponent might be valid strategies
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:43:31] <a1k0n>	it still wants to spam itself for defense
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:43:36] <a1k0n>	and that's fine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:43:50] <jmcarthur>	yeah that's alright, surely
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:43:55] <Cyndre>	is albert in here?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:43:56] <jmcarthur>	probably good, in fact
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:03] <jmcarthur>	it's Cyndre!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:16] <Zannick>	the upside to that is that the opponent isn't entirely sure where you're strong
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:17] <phreeza>	Cyndre: no, i keep trying to get him to come
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:19] <Cyndre>	couldnt miss another contest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:30] <Zannick>	the downside is you can't react as fast for some situations
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:31] <phreeza>	Cyndre: but i can relay a message ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:37] <Zaphus>	anyone know what time it is in serverland ?   probably need a 'current time' thing on your matches page so you can tell how long it's been since your last match
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:44:51] <Cyndre>	just watching his games
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:45:09] <Zannick>	Zaphus: i think it's 16:45?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:45:28] <Zannick>	based on the offset i remember from last night on my games

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:18] <Cyndre>	much nicer :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:20] <a1k0n>	ahhh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:28] <a1k0n>	well here's the problem with that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:29] <jmcarthur>	the visualizer could make the numbers more prominent on top of planets of their own color
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:33] <a1k0n>	it can't coordinate attacks from multiple planets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:44] <a1k0n>	because it isn't smart enough
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:49] <jmcarthur>	if you step slowly you can see the number on the planet go down but you can't see how many fleets it sent out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:55:59] <Zaphus>	now you need to find an artist to make it look pretty :-)   stars in the background, planets that look more like spheres than disks
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:56:01] <Zannick>	you still have two days before the tourney even opens
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:56:09] <jmcarthur>	at least not until another turn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:56:14] <JensTi>	a drop shadow?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:56:16] <a1k0n>	yeah i'm going to throw all this code away anyway
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:56:28] <JensTi>	or just white numbers
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:56:31] <JensTi>	everywhere
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:57:20] <amstan>	did j3camero drop by?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:57:30] <Zaphus>	can you do tooltips, so when you put the cursor over the planet it draws a box with the owner, number of ships, growth rate, planet ID, etc ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [17:58:17] <jmcarthur>	amstan: nah not yet

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:11:14] <Zannick>	the engine is probably dumping it

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:46:58] <antimatroid1>	although, are the arrows on fleets just clogging up the space once we get a lot of fleets going?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:09] <amstan>	we have to merge ships
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:15] <amstan>	then it won't have this problem
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:36] <a1k0n>	if it sends a stream of 1 ship every turn you can't merge them
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:40] <antimatroid1>	you can only merge ships that are expected to arrive at the same time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:51] <a1k0n>	though i guess you could draw a single number above the stream of arrows showing the sum in the centroid
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:52] <antimatroid1>	merge fleets*
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:47:55] <amstan>	oh, yeah, that's one problem
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:48:13] <amstan>	but that case, they should be spaced apart
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [18:48:30] <a1k0n>	or instead of numbers we should just draw arrows for each ship

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:11:53] <Mathnerd314>	jmcarthur: describe it and maybe I'll do it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:12:00] <mightybyte>	It's a bit tougher to apply to this problem.

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:12:19] <a1k0n>	yeah it's going to be very approximate
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:12:45] <Mathnerd314>	hmm, I just realized I have enough info to do that :p
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:13:00] <Mathnerd314>	(Alphabeta pruning)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:13:13] <a1k0n>	do you have a bot running yet?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:13:39] <Mathnerd314>	yeah, doesn't have any interesting code yet
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:13:46] <jmcarthur>	Mathnerd314: time goes from left to right. planets are horizontal lines, where the thickness denotes the number of ships at the planet at any particular time, color denotes which player owns it at any particular time. moving fleets are represented as diagonal lines from planet to planet such that departure and arrival times are correct. thickness and color denotes the same information as for
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:13:48] <jmcarthur>	planets.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:12] <a1k0n>	ah, an interaction diagram
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:15] <mightybyte>	Have we been given any kind of an upper bound on the number of planets?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:15] <jmcarthur>	this is not an animated visual, if it wasn't obvious
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:22] <jmcarthur>	basically, yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:24] <a1k0n>	might also be cool to have a graph of number of ships owned by each player alongside that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:31] <a1k0n>	a stacked graph perhaps
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:51] <jmcarthur>	all kinds of stuff we could do once we are working with a timeline
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:14:52] <a1k0n>	scaled by the square root maybe
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:15:35] <Mathnerd314>	jmcarthur: how to see distance between planets, though?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:15:54] <contestbot>	Top 10 players: albert(628), zaphus(369), inverselimit(282), UloPee(249), galcon(199), cheese_bot(157), j3camero(108), seigen(105), mistabell(60), phreeza(48)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:08] <jmcarthur>	Mathnerd314: that would be lossy. basically would just have to do your best to arrange for the lines to approximate it by their ordering
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:18] <a1k0n>	find the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix across x,y to find the best axial basis, and then project to the longest axis
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:21] <jmcarthur>	Mathnerd314: but the distance would also be apparent from the length of the fleet lines
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:35] <jmcarthur>	pca?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:39] <a1k0n>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:42] <jmcarthur>	that would work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:16:56] <Mathnerd314>	no idea what you're saying :p

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:11] <a1k0n>	since the maps are all symmetric it would probably jsut find the axis of symmetry and planets would all overlap though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:11] <jmcarthur>	Mathnerd314: principal components analysis. google rocks :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:35] <a1k0n>	actually like
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:42] <a1k0n>	just use the axis drawn between the starting planets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:43] <jmcarthur>	well, it would find *an* axis of symmetry
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:47] <a1k0n>	so players are on opposite ends or something
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:17:53] <jmcarthur>	there are two aren't there?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:00] <a1k0n>	one per player
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:03] <jmcarthur>	wait, it's rotational symmetry isn't it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:09] <a1k0n>	true
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:13] <jmcarthur>	ah that could be nice though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:30] <a1k0n>	you'd have to stretch planets that are really close together though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:51] <jmcarthur>	i think the ideal would be to have the planets all the same distance apart in the timeline
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:52] <a1k0n>	also there may be a lot of them so the graph would look pretty cluttered
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:18:56] <jmcarthur>	even if it's "wrong"
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:19:05] <a1k0n>	but ordered by that axis, sure
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:19:08] <jmcarthur>	just have ordering roughly represent distance
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:19:10] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:19:19] <jmcarthur>	distance from some origin on an axis
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:19:54] <jmcarthur>	like i said, distance will be inferrable from the fleet lines anyway
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:20:00] <jmcarthur>	just maybe not as obvious as we might like
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:20:37] <Mathnerd314>	why not do a 3d visualization? have planets be cylinders on the z-axis, ships be 3d lines...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:20:49] <jmcarthur>	Mathnerd314: basic that requires fancy navigation to use effectively
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:21:02] <jmcarthur>	*to view effectively
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:21:27] <Mathnerd314>	surely somebody's written an open-source 3d viewer
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:21:41] <jmcarthur>	maybe would could just have a picture of the map on the left and have all the planet lines project from those planets at angles such that they parallelize and then become time lines

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:50:12] <Zannick>	i call it an engine, sorry for the confusion
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:50:19] <a1k0n>	s/java/jar/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:50:26] <mightybyte>	Zannick: The program that facilitates the game?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:50:50] <Zannick>	PlayGame.jar
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:50:56] <mightybyte>	Yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:50:57] <Zannick>	the server version is engine.py
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:51:04] <mightybyte>	That's what I meant by visualizer/player.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:51:20] <mightybyte>	Ahhh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:51:24] <Zannick>	ah, the visualizer is ShowGame.jar and is completely unnecessary
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:51:49] <a1k0n>	anyway, yes, if you send exactly the same number of ships as the planet has, plus one, it will fail to capture (there was a bug)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:51:52] Join	JCS^ has joined this channel (jcs@189-46-217-230.dsl.telesp.net.br).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:52:05] <a1k0n>	http://a1k0n.net/temp/PlayGame.jar has the latest code plus some optimization
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:52:30] <mightybyte>	Zannick: Yeah, but I saw the problem through the visualizer, so I couldn't determine whether it was PlayGame.jar or ShowGame.jar that was at fault.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:52:36] <Zannick>	yeah, if you grabbed a starter pack way back when there might still be bugs
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:52:44] <ulope>	j3camero: I noticed today that only about 30 matched are being run per hour. Is this because you haven't gotten around to run the engine on more hosts or because you don't have more hosts to run it on? (I'm asking b/c i have a root server doing pretty much nothing all day long, and would be happy to put a few vms on it if that hepls)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:52:47] <mightybyte>	Ok
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:52:51] <j3camero>	a1k0n did you submit your changes on the issue tracker so I can update the official PlayGame.jar?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:01] <a1k0n>	yes, it is issue 69
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:11] <a1k0n>	http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=69
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:14] <j3camero>	ulope: I might take you up on that.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:22] <Zannick>	ulope: j3camero: see issue 70
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:22] <j3camero>	Thanks a1k0n. You rock.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:28] <j3camero>	I will chug through those issues soon.\
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:47] <ulope>	Zannick: that too, but still more hardware = more good ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:47] <Zannick>	the server engine waits 1 sec each turn.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:53:56] <Zannick>	yes :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:54:01] <Zannick>	but i suspect that is why
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:54:12] <Zannick>	if the server is not running games in parallel
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:54:37] <ulope>	j3camero: ok just ping me here or in the forum
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:54:59] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: Your PlayGame.jar has the same problem.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:55:32] <a1k0n>	what is the problem exactly?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:55:52] <mightybyte>	Some of my attacks don't show up as capturing the planets.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:55:57] <Zannick>	oh, is this the fleets disappearing in newer playgame.jar?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:56:03] <a1k0n>	have you figure out under what circumstances?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:56:05] <mightybyte>	(although it still could be in ShowGame.jar)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:56:07] <Zannick>	issue 72?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:56:18] <a1k0n>	yeah, see issue 72?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:56:24] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: Not the nature of the circumstances.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:56:34] <Zannick>	i'll look into it tonight if i can
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:57:00] <a1k0n>	we should just port dhartmei's code back into game.java
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:57:09] <a1k0n>	(with the growth-first bug fixed)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:07] <j3camero>	You guys know more about the code than I do!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:30] <Zannick>	j3camero: i've done little but fix it over the past few days!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:33] <Zannick>	:P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:35] <Zannick>	:)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:37] <jmcarthur>	heh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:46] <j3camero>	Okay, I am going to quickly create a framework so that I can give a bunch of you committer access on the code repo. I will be back in a few minutes, okie?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:58:57] <jmcarthur>	making it open source was clearly a good idea
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:59:05] <a1k0n>	you guys need to write ICFP contest-style super-precise specs
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:59:07] <j3camero>	Yes clearly it was.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:59:33] <seigen>	j3camero: i also might have a server that can help out...

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:59:42] <mightybyte>	That's the transcript of the game.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [19:59:56] <amstan>	a1k0n: ICFP?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:00:17] <mightybyte>	Speaking of ICFP...anyone here going this year?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:00:38] <a1k0n>	i can't believe i completely missed the icfp contest this year
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:00:52] <seigen>	it sucks how you can win a game and have your rating go down
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:00:56] <a1k0n>	amstan: http://icfpcontest.org/2010/task/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:01:35] 	 * danielvf back. Taking a look at Mathnerd314's push
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:01:43] <danielvf>	*pull request
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:01:47] <Mathnerd314>	ah, thanks
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:01:48] <j3camero>	seigen: that's how elo works, hehe
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:02:07] <seigen>	j3camero: the tyranny of the random pair! :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:02:08] <seigen>	;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:02:16] <seigen>	what was mathnerd's pull req?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:02:25] <a1k0n>	or in dagaren's case, do nothing but lose two games and be in 2nd place
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:02:33] <Mathnerd314>	seigen: reverse play
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:02:38] <seigen>	?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:03:00] <Mathnerd314>	so you can watch the game in reverse
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:03:57] <seigen>	oh, nice
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:04:06] <ulope>	I still think the fleets should either have an outline or be of a different color. Simetimes i can hardly follow whats happening even when single stepping frames
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:04:40] <seigen>	ulope: i think it's harder when single stepping.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:04:44] <seigen>	your eyes don't get any motion cues

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:05:29] <ulope>	seigen: true. But sometimes fleets seem to vanish but in reality they have reached their goal but you vant see it b/c the planet is of the same color
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:05:45] <jmcarthur>	i think when you single step there could be some arrows or motion blur or something to show the movement
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:06:27] <ulope>	Maybe show the animation stem from the frame before...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:06:35] <jmcarthur>	also a highlight when ships leave a planet and a blink when they arrive at a planet :)

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:08:54] <seigen>	anyone else on the tcpserver?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:09:01] <seigen>	i keep getting paired against example :(

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:10:35] <seigen>	a1k0n: i think i'm beating you on tcpserver
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:10:49] <a1k0n>	You LOSE against inverselimit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:01] <seigen>	seigen: i lied, it was cheese_bot i was playing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:05] <danielvf>	Lol, a1k0n, you gotta love how happy it makes people to beat you. :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:14] <seigen>	a1k0n: it was cheese-bot i was playing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:17] <inverselimit>	Did you change something?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:17] <seigen>	:P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:32] <a1k0n>	nice.  i was hanging in there for a while but ultimately doomed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:47] <seigen>	who's inverselimit?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:11:49] <seigen>	mathnerd?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:12:01] <a1k0n>	no, inverselimit is inverselimit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:12:10] <a1k0n>	i didn't change anything
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:12:17] <seigen>	how bad is it i can recognize the example bot from the fleet printouts scrolling by :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:12:18] <a1k0n>	you keeled me fair and square
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:12:44] <a1k0n>	you are now tied with dagaren.. who should probably be purged
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:13:42] <mightybyte>	jmcarthur: Are you working on an engine?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:13:48] <inverselimit>	My bot is still extremely stupid, just tweaking a bit.  Probably just a luck board this time.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:14:50] <a1k0n>	mine is also extremely stupid.  i don't think it will survive the first couple days of the contest as-is
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:14:54] <seigen>	a1k0n: that works really well :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:14:55] <ulope>	who's kitani-exp on tcp?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:01] <seigen>	i am.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:02] <a1k0n>	it's just a really lucky combination of simple ideas
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:20] <ulope>	ah ok :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:24] <seigen>	i have a hunch that ideal play here is following a straightforward economic model
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:34] <danielvf>	NPV
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:39] <seigen>	yeah.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:44] <danielvf>	Now I've given away my secrets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:15:53] <contestbot>	Top 10 players: albert(746), zaphus(403), inverselimit(402), galcon(196), j3camero(194), mistabell(129), seigen(126), Max(15), phreeza(1), Mathnerd314(-111)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:08] <seigen>	har har.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:17] <seigen>	i'm really bad at crushing that final fleet.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:25] <a1k0n>	NPV looks like it derives from markov decision processes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:32] <inverselimit>	agree, mine is economically motivated as well
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:39] <a1k0n>	reinforcement learning is isometric
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:39] <seigen>	which probably means my "reinforce planets with incoming fleets" is probably buggy.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:49] <seigen>	a1k0n: NPV = net present value?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:50] <jmcarthur>	mightybyte: define engine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:16:55] <a1k0n>	seigen: yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:00] <jmcarthur>	mightybyte: i'm doing my bot from scratch, if that's what you mean
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:04] <mightybyte>	jmcarthur: A competing entry
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:15] <jmcarthur>	yeah i'm competing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:17] <a1k0n>	the bellman equation is a generalization
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:24] <mightybyte>	jmcarthur: Using haskell?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:27] <jmcarthur>	yup
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:30] <mightybyte>	Me too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:35] <jmcarthur>	awesome
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:37] <mightybyte>	Bit the bullet this time.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:39] <jmcarthur>	you did C++ last time right?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:42] <mightybyte>	Yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:53] <seigen>	a1k0n: is "discounted cash flows" not a close enough approximation?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:17:53] <mightybyte>	Leveraging a lot of other game code I'd written.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:18:03] <jmcarthur>	well i look forward to competing with you more directly then :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:18:04] <a1k0n>	seigen: no idea!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:18:22] <mightybyte>	jmcarthur: Did you use jaspervdj's starter kit?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:18:23] <seigen>	well, dagaren is not completely idle, btw.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:18:33] <seigen>	just played him.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:18:42] <a1k0n>	oh good
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:19:01] <seigen>	and won :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:19:02] <jmcarthur>	mightybyte: i'm not using it, although i'm taking some inspiration from it in certain ways
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:19:22] <jmcarthur>	i'm a reinvent the wheel kind of guy, i guess
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:20:35] <a1k0n>	ah interesting.  so you promote the value of planets closer to your opponent?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:20:41] <jmcarthur>	mightybyte: i was trying for the past couple of days to get ghc 6.12.3 to work on ubuntu 8.04 (what the official server is running), but failed miserably
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:20:51] <a1k0n>	or closer to other planets that could be overtaken
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:21:25] <Zaphus>	I'm more a "I wonder if this AI change will work...   oh, nope, it didnt... oh crap, forgot to back up the old file..." kind of guy.   Really should get some source control going at home, except I use a removable drive in multiple locations - need a portable source control
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:21:48] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: you mean like distributed version control? ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:04] <a1k0n>	heh.  i already have 13 git commits
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:09] <seigen>	noooo inverselimit :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:26] <a1k0n>	yessss inverselimit
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:30] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: most of us here are probably using git. i'm more of a darcs guy. there may be some mercurial guys here. any of those would work for you
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:32] <seigen>	Zaphus: yeah, i've got quite a git log already
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:33] 	 * a1k0n has a vested interest in inverselimit's elo now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:22:39] <seigen>	i'm on mercurial
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:23:25] <Zaphus>	can git handle me working offline ?  I sometimes connect the removable drive to a machine I cannot install stuff on (work machines) so would have no git there
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:23:51] <a1k0n>	git doesn't require you to be online ever
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:23:59] <a1k0n>	unless you want to expliclty push code to another machine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:24:11] <Zaphus>	doesnt require an install either ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:24:28] <a1k0n>	oh, well, not necessarily though you could just edit code and commit it later
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:24:45] <a1k0n>	i dunno how self-contained it is
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:24:58] <jmcarthur>	it requires something to be installed, yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:25:10] <jmcarthur>	well. i think it at least has a few files spread out around the hard drive
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:25:12] <a1k0n>	you can ./configure --prefix=$HOME and install it in your homedir
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:25:20] <jmcarthur>	darcs is a self-contained binary, i think
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:25:34] <jmcarthur>	dunno about mercurial. it's python, so is probably in a million pieces ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:25:50] <Zaphus>	I'd rather something self contained that lived on the removable drive so I could just plug in and go anywhere, no need to install stuff on the machine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:26:26] <jmcarthur>	any of them would probably work if you don't mind having a some bin and lib directories on your portable drive
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:26:35] <seigen>	a1k0n: :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:26:35] <jmcarthur>	although darcs would probably be the cleanest of them since it's just a binary
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:26:37] <seigen>	back to tweakin!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:26:50] <jmcarthur>	it also has docs and stuff, but i guess you don't need that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:27:34] <jmcarthur>	darcs is also easiest to learn, IMO
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:27:51] <jmcarthur>	and i could make a point or two for it being the most powerful, but that would just be controversial :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:28:34] <jmcarthur>	i bet i'm the only darcs fan in here
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:28:46] <icefox>	j3camero: heard that you had the ability to turn on account creation for a minute, can I join or should i wait till friday?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:28:49] <a1k0n>	probably but i won't deny git is a pain to learn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:29:02] <Zaphus>	I'll have a look, don't care how much stuff lives on the drive, just want it to be extremely portable
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:29:22] Quit	seigen has left this server (Quit: time to go home).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:30:36] <jmcarthur>	i actually found git pretty enjoyable, especially when i was first learning it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:30:46] <jmcarthur>	didn't find the learning curve very steep

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:40:48] <ulope>	inverselimit: thanks.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:41:04] <mightybyte>	Open up http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/mightybyte/game.out with ShowGame.jar and you'll see the problem.  Several fleets just disappear.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:42:14] <jmcarthur>	i can't wait to replace that with the canvas visualizer
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:42:37] <a1k0n>	we do need a client-side game visualizer that isn't the sucky java one
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:42:47] <a1k0n>	or maybe the java one could just be made not sucky
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:42:55] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:43:09] <mightybyte>	Grrrr, maybe I'm going to have to bite the bullet and write my own in Haskell.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:43:23] <jmcarthur>	we could make a tourny script that generates a bunch of game logs and a handy html page with info and links to replays
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:43:34] <jmcarthur>	replays in the canvas visualizer, that is
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:43:45] <jmcarthur>	it wouldn't be something you can watch live though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:44:02] <a1k0n>	yeah we need live visualiztion
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:44:20] <a1k0n>	mightybyte: whoa wtf.  i've never seen that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:44:24] <a1k0n>	what JRE are you using?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:44:32] <mightybyte>	Uhhhhh...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:44:41] <danielvf>	jmcarthur: We definilty need that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:00] <mightybyte>	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:04] <danielvf>	To really know how good your bot is, you can't go off one game
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:13] <a1k0n>	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:18] <jmcarthur>	danielvf: yeah, but it would be nice if you could watch it live as well
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:20] <ratatata>	a1k0n: was the PlayGame.jar you linked fixed against 'disappearing fleets' ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:22] <a1k0n>	same one.  huh.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:24] <jmcarthur>	danielvf: like the one we had in the last contest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:35] <jmcarthur>	i forget who made that...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:35] <a1k0n>	ratatata: it appears not, though it was current svn code
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:45:53] <a1k0n>	a combined engine/viz would be nice
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:03] <danielvf>	The visualizer can easily be modified to handle new turns added live
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:10] <danielvf>	What about Titanioum
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:12] <tapwater>	personally, I like how the engine and visualizer are separate
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:19] <tapwater>	that's what made the js visualizer possible
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:24] <danielvf>	http://www.appcelerator.com/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:28] <jmcarthur>	tapwater: it's nice to play replays, but it's also nice to watch live
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:36] <danielvf>	Run a python enigine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:37] <a1k0n>	or if the engine output compressed base64 strings that a viz could parse and you could use to debug frames
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:46:51] <danielvf>	and display in a webkit window
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:47:44] <tapwater>	jmcarthur: for live games, something will need to read the engine and broadcast in real time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:47:52] <tapwater>	I don't think combining the two is necessary
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:48:08] <jmcarthur>	tapwater: no they dont' need to be the same program
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:48:21] <jmcarthur>	but it'd be nice to at least have a visualizer that doesn't require the whole game in advance
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:48:31] <tapwater>	true
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:48:59] <tapwater>	I'm sure it'll be easy to mod the js visualizer to read via websockets :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:49:21] <danielvf>	jmcarthur: I build a node.js server that streamed selections from the log  file live to the visualizer
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:49:26] <jmcarthur>	danielvf: so your idea is to have a client side python engine that interfaces with the visualizer via ajax or something?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:49:59] <jmcarthur>	"client side" meaning "local"
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:09] <jmcarthur>	not "browser" of course
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:18] <danielvf>	With titanium, I think they give you API's to have python scripts talk directly to the apps window
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:27] <danielvf>	which is running it's own webkit browser
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:27] <jmcarthur>	i'm just not familiar with it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:31] <jmcarthur>	ah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:39] <a1k0n>	tapwater: hey that's a good idea
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:50:56] <a1k0n>	or yeah node.js
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:10] <danielvf>	But then the user has to install node. :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:13] <mightybyte>	Are any of the contest organizers here right now?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:26] <danielvf>	Better to hack the streaming onto python perhaps
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:32] <jmcarthur>	i wouldn't mind installing some stuff to get decent local real-time viewing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:34] <danielvf>	or even the java one
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:47] <jmcarthur>	or is node.js a lot of work to set up?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:56] <a1k0n>	it's pretty easy to install
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:51:58] <hornairs_>	i think a node.js server just watching the log file for changes would be sufficient
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:09] <hornairs_>	a1k0n is right its not bad at all
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:10] <jmcarthur>	amstan, j3camero: around?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:12] <a1k0n>	it installs a binary called 'node' which runs javascript code
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:13] <danielvf>	The advantage of titanium is that you would have a one  version for all OS.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:18] <amstan>	jmcarthur: idk
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:23] <danielvf>	node doesn't run on windows though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:28] <danielvf>	not at the moment
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:28] <jmcarthur>	heh

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:52:32] <a1k0n>	ah yeah.  windows.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:53:03] <jmcarthur>	screw windows :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:53:22] <a1k0n>	mightybyte: if you (cat maps/map(whichever).txt; echo go) | ./yourbot, what does it print?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:54:05] <a1k0n>	and which map is it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:54:18] <mightybyte>	map7
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:54:58] <hornairs_>	danielvf you want to make something to visualize local games live right? wouldn't something to visualize games during the competition be better since everyone could watch it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:09] <a1k0n>	i want to see if i can reproduce by using (cat your_cmds; yes go) as a bot
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:18] <jmcarthur>	hornairs_: this is for testing and debugging
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:35] <danielvf>	hornairs_:  During the competition, a delay of a couple minutes is fine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:39] <danielvf>	for debugging, it's not
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:46] <danielvf>	http://brains.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/2010/vis1.2/index.html
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:50] <jmcarthur>	hornairs_: it stinks to wait through a whole game just to open up the viewer and see that the first couple of moves were stupid buggy things that you could have fixed immediately if you had been able to see it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:55:55] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: 1 17 5; 1 18 5; 1 11 13; 1 12 13; 1 0 38; 1 5 23; go

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:57:41] <jmcarthur>	a button to toggle them might be better
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:57:57] <jmcarthur>	and use mouseovers to give stats on individuals rather than on all of them?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:58:02] <ulope>	danielvf: very nice with the mouseover-only display of fleet strength
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:58:05] <jmcarthur>	dunno, just thinking aloud
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:58:24] <danielvf>	The target audience for the visualizer is coders. So numbers are important.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:58:44] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:59:04] <ulope>	jmcarthur: Individual stat would be even cooler though.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:59:34] <jmcarthur>	individual stats could also include more information
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [20:59:49] <jmcarthur>	like turns remaining, highlight the source and destination planets, etc.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:00:50] <jmcarthur>	i still don't like how if you go to the beginning of the game and then step one turn the planet's numbers drop but you don't see any fleets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:00:57] <jmcarthur>	because they are just overlapping the planets
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:01:12] <tapwater>	wait, so is growth supposed to happen before or after movement?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:01:51] <danielvf>	Yeah. I think I'm going to go back to numbers, and leave in the if for turning them on and off, so I can do it with the console for my own viewing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:01:57] <jmcarthur>	all i know is it's supposed to happen before attacks. i don't know about before or after departures
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:02:21] <tapwater>	ah ok
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:02:26] <tapwater>	cause that's not happening haha
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:02:56] <tapwater>	my planets are being captured when a growth before attack would have saved them
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:01] <jmcarthur>	does anybody know about whether growth is supposed to be before or after departures?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:23] <mightybyte>	rtfc
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:24] <danielvf>	jmcarthur:  check the source

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:28] <a1k0n>	supposed to be before, tcp server has it after
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:29] <danielvf>	lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:36] <jmcarthur>	the source is always inconsistent!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:42] <jmcarthur>	see?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:42] <a1k0n>	oh shit, i have the disappearing fleet problem too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:03:44] <jmcarthur>	:P

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:10:08] <j3camero>	Let me be clearer there. The python engine, engine.py, is used by the server.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:10:50] <mightybyte>	And that can't easily be used by us for testing right?  (due to db stuff amongst other things)

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:52:08] <madsy>	Is this a bug? In the recording format, when new fleets are created, the ETA is always one less than the total trip time.

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:52:44] <danielvf>	madsy: no, since when the fleet arrives it does battle calculations
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:52:53] <madsy>	So if the distance it should travel is 17, then ETA is 16 rounds.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:53:09] <madsy>	danielvf: Pardon?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:54:29] <madsy>	I mean when new fleets are initially created.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:54:44] <danielvf>	They are created one turn away

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:57:11] <danielvf>	j3camero: reading it now
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:57:19] <madsy>	I was puzzled, because I'm coding a viewer. And I assumed the ships would initially start in the planet center.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:57:49] <danielvf>	They sort of do, but it all happens inside the server
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:58:01] <danielvf>	when it's processing the turn
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:58:05] <j3camero>	I think they probably should start in the center. If the travel distance is 2, and we are on turn 1, then they should arrive at turn 3.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:58:23] <danielvf>	Right, but the client doesn't find out about them until turn 2
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:58:32] <j3camero>	True enough.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [21:59:44] <j3camero>	I think the problem is that the game loop goes: (1) Process client orders (2) Advance one turn (3) Report game state. Would it fix the problem if it was 1, 3, 2 instead?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:00:31] <danielvf>	j3camero: That would seem wrong from a clients pov.

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:25:26] <j3camero>	Zaphus: if (botname == "Accoun") { lose_game(); }
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:25:47] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: "The auto-compile environment could not locate your main code file."
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:25:48] <danielvf>	j3camero: I was thinking about making a second php file for the new visualizer, so that it can be they can be live in parallel for testing, then just replace the old after we know it works.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:26:15] <Zaphus>	you'll need to get it working on IE (doesnt seem to work there)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:26:25] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i did have a MyBot.hs in it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:26:49] <danielvf>	Zaphus: We'll fall back to the old visualizer for IE
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:26:51] <ulope>	Ok I'm off to bed. Its 4:30 am for me already (again, argh!)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:26:51] Quit	mistabell has left this server (Quit: Page closed).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:26:59] <danielvf>	ulope: Night
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:27:08] <ulope>	night all
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:28:36] <j3camero>	danielvf: that sounds like a solid approach. Still use a branch, since it's not that much extra work.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:28:58] <danielvf>	j3camero: Right. Got that part. :D
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:02] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: it should list the files it's looking for in that email. Did it list MyBot.hs?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:11] <jmcarthur>	yes it did
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:12] 	 * danielvf goes to bed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:17] <jmcarthur>	but it still claimed not to see it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:27] <j3camero>	danielvf: awesome. I can't wait to get that new viz up and running. It's so much smoother and prettier.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:28] <amstan>	perhaps we need to make a devel forum
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:29:55] <danielvf>	j3camero: yeah, me either.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:31:02] <j3camero>	amstan: will the mailing list work? http://groups.google.com/group/ai-contest-discuss

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:31:40] <jmcarthur>	k
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:32:12] <amstan>	"How do you want to read this group?" this is so complicated... lol
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:32:14] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: oh i know why :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:32:18] <jmcarthur>	it's my fault
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:32:22] <jmcarthur>	sorry bout that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:33:50] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: okay, the compilation succeeded
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:34:08] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: now just look for a file called SPLOIT above my bot's directory (where i shouldn't have access)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:34:19] <amstan>	jmcarthur: i can do this too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:34:36] <jmcarthur>	amstan: or you then :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:36:04] <amstan>	j3camero: what's with the shell? tab completion doesn't work, up down don't work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:36:21] <jmcarthur>	oh, SPLOITED, not SPLOIT
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:36:34] <jmcarthur>	i forgot what i called it :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:36:55] <j3camero>	amstan: change your shell then, n00b
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:37:16] <amstan>	zomg, much better
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:37:17] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: just so I know where to look, is this file being create during compilation, or during runtime?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:37:20] <amstan>	stupid /bin/sh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:37:22] <jmcarthur>	and sadly i just attempted what i thought might fix it here, but my fix didn't work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:37:25] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: compile time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:37:51] <amstan>	find SPLOITED in /home does not give me anything
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:08] <jmcarthur>	encouraging
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:15] <j3camero>	amstan: wrong place to look
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:19] <jmcarthur>	discouraging
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:25] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: okay it worked. SPOLITED was there.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:30] <amstan>	j3camero: where?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:32] <jmcarthur>	dang
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:44] <amstan>	jmcarthur: so.. what did you do?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:52] <jmcarthur>	we need a way to disable template haskell
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:38:58] <j3camero>	In planet_wars/submissions/ in the contest environment. where the stuff gets compiled.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:39:17] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: lol. I didn't think any languages would let you do that...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:39:21] <amstan>	j3camero: where's that?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:39:36] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: it's basically the ability to run arbitrary haskell code at compile time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:39:39] <j3camero>	amstan: /home/contest/ai-contest/planet_wars/submissions/
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:39:50] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i didn't consider performing IO with it until just now though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:39:56] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: wow fuck. That is bad news for Haskell, haha.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:09] <jmcarthur>	yeah :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:10] <Mathnerd314>	jmcarthur, j3camero: couldn't you just apply the same restrictions to compile-time that you apply to runtime?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:18] <jmcarthur>	i'm asking in #haskell if there is a way
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:24] <jmcarthur>	to disable it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:29] <j3camero>	Oh gawd. Now I need to think about sandboxing the compile pipeline like we do with the runtime. Ugh.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:48] <amstan>	j3camero: sandbox, but allow creation of object files
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:40:51] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: much appreciate. Wanna become a committer so you can fix the problem if there is a way to fix it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:01] <jmcarthur>	sure
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:13] <jmcarthur>	i'm researching it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:18] <j3camero>	Nice
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:34] <jmcarthur>	because... well... i really want to be able to use haskell :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:46] <jmcarthur>	the only other way i can think of would be to allow me to upload binaries
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:46] <j3camero>	amstan: I think we could sandbox the compile pipeline pretty easily. We would just have to move all the files into the sandbox, compile them in the sandbox, then send all the files back out.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:41:53] <jmcarthur>	which is oddly safer than allowing haskell right now :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:42:11] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: strangely enough...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:42:52] <jmcarthur>	(and i wouldn't be opposed to uploading binaries *cough cough*)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:44:57] <JCS^>	a1k0n's bot really owns with the expansion tatics

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:46:50] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: okay i have a fix. not completely ideal, but it's probably okay
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:46:56] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: ghc-pkg hide template-haskell
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:46:59] <Mathnerd314>	JCS^: which game in particular does he own in?

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:47:20] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: that at least hides the functions that allow arbitrary IO to execute at compile time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:47:35] <jmcarthur>	it also hides all other template haskell functions, which is probably okay
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:47:47] <amstan>	jmcarthur: it seems that #haskell is ignoring you
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:47:52] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: that should be a run-once command
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:47:59] <jmcarthur>	amstan: yeah. unusual

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:48:49] <Zaphus>	even more impressive to take 3rd place then!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [22:48:52] <jmcarthur>	it shouldn't win any matches at all

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:01:39] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: wicked. Send me your gmail so I can add you as a committer. Also, read this: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/HowToContribute. Really the only rule is don't commit any changes to trunk.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:01:48] <dmj>	amstan:  awesome.   My first hack up of someones bot was adding all sorts of responses to an emacs lisp bot.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:01:50] <jmcarthur>	amstan: i can't think of a way

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:07:03] <PurplePanda>	what version of python are we using?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:07:32] <amstan>	PurplePanda: 2.5 for now, if you want something better you have to give us instalation instructions for ubuntu server 8.04
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:07:35] <j3camero>	a1k0n: you have been added as a committer. Please read and abide by this: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/HowToContribute. Never commit to trunk. Instead, use branches for all changes, as described in the wiki article.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:07:46] <a1k0n>	j3camero: thanks much
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:08:16] <a1k0n>	is there a branch naming scheme we should use?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:08:25] <j3camero>	a1k0n you rule. Fixing stuff is awesome. Do they have 20% projects at Yahoo?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:08:28] <a1k0n>	e.g. issue72?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:08:38] <amstan>	a1k0n: that would be fine too
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:08:46] <a1k0n>	depends on the group.  not as a company-wide thing, but some managers are open to it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:09:00] <dmj>	j3camero:  not sure I will do much, and I have only been hanging around here an hour , but I did spend too much time on this last year :)  dmj111@gmail
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:09:11] <a1k0n>	i believe it's the same at google, where some managers just assign 120% of work
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:09:13] <j3camero>	a1k0n: it's up to you. I am easy. Naming after issues could actually be really descriptive. Alternatively, just use some descriptive name: branches/fixing_timeout_bug_in_java_visualizer.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:09:28] Quit	madsy has left this server (Read error: Connection reset by peer).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:09:54] <amstan>	PurplePanda: people are already working on getting 2.6/2.7
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:10:18] <PurplePanda>	amstan, thanks. If someone gave you installation instructions for 3.0 you would use them? that would break my 2.5 code.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:10:32] <j3camero>	dmj: you have been added. Please read and abide by this wiki page: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/HowToContribute. Never commit to trunk. Use branches as described in the article.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:06] <amstan>	PurplePanda: depends on how easy it would be to run 2 versions at the same time(3, with the default 2.5 that comes with the system)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:10] <a1k0n>	j3camero: are you opening up beta accounts on the main site tonight?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:17] <amstan>	@where repository
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:17] <j3camero>	PurplePanda I would say we'll probably stick with 2.x
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:18] <lambdabot>	I know nothing about repository.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:34] <lambdabot>	help
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:40] <lambdabot>	@help
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:41] <j3camero>	a1k0n: sure, why not? Do you not have one yet?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:44] <a1k0n>	i do not
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:56] <a1k0n>	i was trying to avoid getting sucked in.  as you can see, that didn't work at all.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:11:59] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: months ago we discussed allowing binaries even if only on a case-by-case basis. is that still a possibility? i can't get a recent version of ghc to play nice with ubuntu 8.04 and i really feel the need to use a more recent version than the one on the server
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:12:02] <PurplePanda>	arf "probably" does not exactly fill me with confidence, but okay, I will write for 2.5 :-)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:12:39] <j3camero>	Okay a1k0n create an account.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:13:13] <a1k0n>	signup.php is a 404
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:13:22] <a1k0n>	oh heh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:13:31] <PurplePanda>	I got that yesterday before I refreshed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:13:40] <j3camero>	PurplePanda we will do our best. We are always open to suggestions. On this issue, I can see people having a serious reason to want 2.6 over 2.5, but I can't imagine someone truly needing 3.x. So I think we will stick with 2.x.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:14:00] <a1k0n>	j3camero: thx, done
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:14:15] <j3camero>	a1k0n: is there a broken link that points to signup.php?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:14:17] <a1k0n>	j3camero: FYI the login page points to signup.php whereas the 'sign up' link in the header points to register.php (which works)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:14:27] <j3camero>	Yikes. Fixing now.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:15:25] <dmj>	j3camero: thanks, and it is read.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:15:41] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: I'm worried that you'll win the contest again, and that all my careful programming will go to waste.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:15:44] <PurplePanda>	j3camero, for myself I don't mind at all which version. I'm just looking for someone to tell me what to write for, and a grantee that you won't break that by changing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:16:44] <amstan>	PurplePanda: 2.5
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:16:58] <amstan>	PurplePanda: since 2.6/2.7 is backwards compatible
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:17:00] <j3camero>	PurplePanda: as usual, no guarantees :-) But I am telling you that I can't imagine any good reason why we would move to 3.x. Odds are you'll be okay.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:17:37] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: not to nag but... binaries?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:17:50] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: right. I am not ignoring you, haha.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:17:52] <j3camero>	just busy.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:17:57] <jmcarthur>	heh i understand
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:04] <j3camero>	I feel kind of sketch about accepting binaries.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:09] <jmcarthur>	just making sure i'm not lost in the flood of nick pings ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:13] <j3camero>	That being said, I can't see any reason not to, really.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:27] <a1k0n>	Mathnerd314: i'm worried people will expect me to do well in this contest
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:28] <jmcarthur>	yeah if you are allowing C you're allowing anything
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:43] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: exactly
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:18:56] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: you mentioned before that you feared bandwidth issues though
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:07] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i could try to come up with a way to address that if it would make you feel better
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:24] <jmcarthur>	but first i should just do some math anyway to see if it really could be an issue
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:38] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: do you think a typical binary will be under 2 MB?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:42] <a1k0n>	jmcarthur: how did your exploit experiment go?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:50] <j3camero>	a1k0n: it worked!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:52] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: i succeeded and we patched it :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:55] <a1k0n>	j3camero: if it's stripped it will almost always be under 2MB
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:19:58] <dmj>	a1k0n:  the price of fame :( On a serious note, your post mortem was really well done.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:03] <a1k0n>	awesome.  what was it?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:14] <a1k0n>	dmj: thanks!  glad you enjoyed it.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:28] <mightybyte>	Has a decision been made on the official battle resolution algorithm?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:32] <a1k0n>	i guess i need to write the story about how the contest/my post mortem changed my life
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:32] <j3camero>	He found a way to execute arbitrary Haskell at compile-time.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:45] <a1k0n>	ooh, hahah
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:20:46] <dmj>	its sitting next to me while I plan this contest.  bwa hah ha ha.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:00] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: yes, write it to inspire me to do better than you :p
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:04] <a1k0n>	dmj: my post mortem is?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:15] <j3camero>	mightybyte: I don't think anything official has happened. You could decide if you want.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:38] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i don't know what kind of bandwidth we expect the server to have to deal with. what is expected and what is "bad"?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:57] <mightybyte>	I kind of like the two-attacking-fleets-take-each-other-out-before-attacking-the-planet approach.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:59] <dmj>	a1kon:  sorry, my sense of tiredness overcame my sense of humor.  But yeah, I was thinking about the stuff you did to really optimize your algorithm.  The tools and stuff.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:21:59] <Zaphus>	j3camero:  Accepting binaries means no way for you to see what it is doing, accepting code means you (or someone not competing) could check to make sure it appears safe
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:22:06] <j3camero>	mightybyte: do you want to have commit access to the code repo, just in case the urge to fix issues or make new features strikes?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:22:10] <mightybyte>	...but it doesn't scale very well to more than two players.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:22:34] <dmj>	a1kon:  last time, I kept thinking of a bunch of tools that would have made testing a lot easier, but I kept saying "not enough time to do that stuff...."
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:22:51] <mightybyte>	j3camero: Nah, I'm short on time.  I have enough on my plate just trying to make an entry of my own.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:22:58] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: if it does something malicious it could just cover its tracks before anybody suspects anyway
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:01] <j3camero>	mightybyte: cool dawg
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:06] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: binary or not
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:14] <a1k0n>	ah, yeah.  my "tools" were extremely crude but they got me the game analysis data i needed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:15] <Zannick>	j3camero: i'll take commit access
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:24] <Zannick>	i'm jokeserver
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:30] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yeah. To tell you the truth, I have actually never looked at a contestants' code before.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:43] <a1k0n>	not having a frame-by-frame ascii dump in the log of the game is going to make it harder this time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:23:47] <j3camero>	Zannick: alright. Waht's your @gmail address?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:24:25] <Zannick>	j3camero: jokeserver@
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:24:29] <j3camero>	a1k0n: the PlayGame.jar outputs such a log I believe.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:24:35] <dmj>	a1k0n:  that new visualizer is super nice.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:24:53] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: my bot from the tron contest stripped and zipped weighs in at 516K
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:09] <a1k0n>	dmj: yeah it's really excellent.  i just need a way to stitch visualization together with my debug output
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:09] <Queue29>	j3camero, can you tell if the commands I have posted here: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=423#p2579  work on Ubuntu 8.04 ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:14] <Zaphus>	jmcarthur:  True, but binaries are just asking for it :-)   anyway I'm being selfish, I cant make binaries for it because I'm working in Windows :-)    - if you are going to allow binaries, then allow makefiles to be uploaded too so we can turn on optimisations
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:37] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: but that is actually more dangerous because the compilation is not sandboxed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:37] <a1k0n>	j3camero: yeah, it's suitable for viz but it only outputs after the entire game is processed
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:42] <j3camero>	Zannick: you have commit access. Please read this: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/HowToContribute. Never commit to trunk. Always use a branch for every change as described in the article. I am really glad to have you on board!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:46] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: that was the core of my exploit earlier
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:48] <dmj>	a1k0n:  I see.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:25:59] <dmj>	Later
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:26:11] <a1k0n>	cya
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:27:34] <j3camero>	a1k0n: it doesn't need to be that way. You could patch the client-side engine to output as the game goes on.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:27:47] <Zaphus>	jmcarthur:  Ok, the sandboxing does make a difference.   Still feel like theres no way for anyone to even try and check if a bot is attempting to cheat when it is a .exe, at least you *could* look at code if required, even if you couldnt figure it out
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:28:03] <j3camero>	a1k0n: it would be such an easy patch. Just replace gamePlayback += with System.out.println(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:28:05] <Zaphus>	then again, obfuscurate the code...  same problem I guess
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:28:07] <a1k0n>	j3camero: i was just thinking of doing that
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:28:28] <a1k0n>	j3camero: i have a patch to replace gamePlayback += with gamePlayback.append and make it a stringbuffer, because the += is *really slow* on a long game
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:28:42] <a1k0n>	but yeah it might as well just go to stdout immediately
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:28:43] <Zannick>	j3camero: great, thanks
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:29:18] <Zannick>	i'm going to commit a couple of my patches that have been sitting in the issues list for a few days
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:29:26] <j3camero>	a1k0n: jsut remember to System.out.flush() after every call so the game doesn't hang.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:29:54] <a1k0n>	the game won't hang if it isn't flushed; it's not flushed now.  but still, yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:29:56] <j3camero>	Zannick: awesome. That's what I was hoping would start to happen. I have been trying to get to them.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:30:24] <j3camero>	a1k0n: I suspect you're right. Still, I have learned from experience to just always flush.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:30:27] <Zannick>	obv you'll still have to review them :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:30:28] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: my zipped binary is half the size of the zipped java starter pack! ;)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:30:29] <Zaphus>	j3camero:  Any sign of the updated scheduler being rolled out to the live server ?   (although the 30 minute figure seems too small for me, I'd have thought a few hours given how slow the games are)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:31:01] <a1k0n>	iirc they're using an 8-core server and running up to 4 games in parallel
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:31:06] <jmcarthur>	less than, even
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:31:14] <j3camero>	Zannick: yep. In practice, you will probably enentually become a "reviewer" who can merge to trunk.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:31:40] <a1k0n>	it'd be really cool if you could see which games are being played live
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:31:41] Quit	dmj has left this server (Quit: Page closed).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:31:49] <a1k0n>	like a constant tournament stream
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:32:09] <Mathnerd314>	rss feed? :p
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:32:20] <a1k0n>	that would't be too hard
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:32:49] <j3camero>	Zaphus: yes I will roll out the updated scheduler asap. I still need to try out the patch. I will do it though. It's a must-have for Friday.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:33:21] <a1k0n>	Zaphus: did you do anything beyond removing the unnecessary sleep?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:33:27] <j3camero>	Zaphus: I will take care of it, since it needs to be tested on the live server (shitty, I know. My poor design. But we're stuck with it ATM)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:33:29] <Zaphus>	it would be good to get 24hrs of testing on it.    is it worth letting some of us create a second account  (TESTzaphus) to add more bots for load/schedule testing ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:33:32] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: that + PubSubHubbub
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:34:02] <Zaphus>	a1k0n:  wrong person, I didnt do the code - just admired it :-)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:34:10] <j3camero>	Zaphus: nah, I have a script that can create hundreds of bots and submit thousands of bots that all behave differently.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:34:14] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: i'll just make a ticket instead of continuously hassling you about it
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:34:23] <a1k0n>	can we mark issue 73 a dupe of 72?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:34:42] <mightybyte>	Looks like they are probably the same.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:35:10] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: good idea. I am not sure about the wisdom of allowing binaries. There are arguments on both sides of that one. It feels scary. Let's decide it in a few days.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:35:24] <a1k0n>	my bot isn't getting any games yet :(
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:35:26] <j3camero>	a1k0n let me check out the 72/73 thing
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:35:39] <j3camero>	a1k0n: it's because of the shitty scheduler. My bad.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:35:55] <a1k0n>	ahh, issue 68
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:36:23] <Zaphus>	Anyone feel like writing a twitter app, to tweet the top 10 every hour or something like that ?   or better, one that you link yourself and your bot to so it tweets you when you play a game ?  :-)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:36:46] Quit	McLeopold has left this server (Quit: Leaving).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:36:47] Join	madsy has joined this channel (~madsy@fu/coder/madsy).
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:36:53] <j3camero>	Can someone send an email to jeff@ai-contest.com just so I can see if the forwarding works right?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:37:00] <a1k0n>	sure
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:38:05] <a1k0n>	man you totally should have open sourced it last time
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:38:20] <a1k0n>	by the third contest you should have the most awesome live contest match scheduler ever
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:38:24] <j3camero>	a1k0n: i know. but I didn't expect 2500 people to compete, haha.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:03] <a1k0n>	heh!
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:04] <a1k0n>	i'm trying to recruit some coworkers
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:04] <j3camero>	a1k0n: it's a miracle the servers did not crumble. It was only meant for like 200 people.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:04] <a1k0n>	the antispam team i'm in now has some really awesome machine learning people
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:11] <j3camero>	a1k0n I am not sure if 72/73 are dupes. We shall see once we get to those.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:38] <j3camero>	a1k0n: if you can recruit some of them to help out with the contest itself, that would be so cool. I have a feeling we're gonna need manpower.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:41] <a1k0n>	i am able to verify on, e.g., map 7 if you send 13 ships to the open 12-ship neutrals, your fleets just disappear on arrival
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:39:49] <mightybyte>	j3camero: I think those two issues should be pretty high on the priority list.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:40:00] <j3camero>	mightybyte: agreed.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:40:05] <a1k0n>	i don't know if the python engine has the same problem or not
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:40:07] <Zaphus>	j3camero:  Question, for the preliminaries (i.e. not the finals) are the maps the same ones as given in the startup pack ?   if so, can we get the mapnum displayed in the match history.   If not... is there any way to let us get the map definition so we can try at home with the same map that we suck on ?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:40:32] <a1k0n>	j3camero: but i think the battle resolution code could use a rewrite as it's very buggy and much more complicated than it needs to be
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:40:53] <mightybyte>	There's a patch for that too.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:41:07] <a1k0n>	there is?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:41:29] <mightybyte>	http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=64
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:41:33] <Zaphus>	I suggest locking this competition down to 2 players, go with the nice 2-player resolution code.   If 3-4 players are to be done later then new resolution code can be figured out at that point
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:41:47] <a1k0n>	oh hell yes
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:41:53] <a1k0n>	that will probably fix 72&73
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:42:12] <mightybyte>	I think the patch in 64 is arguably the best way to do it.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:42:18] <jmcarthur>	alright, issue 75 is about binary submissions
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:42:32] <mightybyte>	It supports more than two players trivially, and it also is extremely simple.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:43:10] <jmcarthur>	is that the one that implements my proposed algorithm
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:43:11] <jmcarthur>	?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:43:18] <a1k0n>	i also think dhartmei's code works similarly
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:43:21] <mightybyte>	Yeah, I think so.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:43:58] <a1k0n>	jmcarthur: i dunno, does your proposed algorithm match what it says in the link?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:44:17] <Zaphus>	for 3 players,  #64 is effectively a mexican standoff where they all shoot at the same time ?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:44:39] <jmcarthur>	ah looks like it was submitted by somebody who agreed with my proposal, so i imagine it is mine
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:45:15] <j3camero>	a1k0n: I like the idea of fixing the battle resolution code. It is kind of horrible.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:45:18] <jmcarthur>	Zaphus: looks like a mexican standoff normally doesn't end in a tie :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:46:00] <Zaphus>	jmcarthur:  true, I'm just imagining them all firing at once.   A shoots B, B shoots C, C shoots A    thats how you get the tie
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:46:07] <a1k0n>	hmm, my bot loses against albert on the official server, and it looks like it's due to the growth-before vs growth-after battles
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:46:24] <j3camero>	Zaphus: isn't the entire map definition contained in the game playback string?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:46:57] <Zaphus>	j3camero:  Yes, it is - but we dont get the playback strings from the official server.  I want to test on the same map that XXX crushed me
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:47:42] <a1k0n>	Zaphus: http://ai-contest.com/game_info.php?game_id=<x>
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:47:44] <j3camero>	Oh man, there is a way to get the playback strings. I dunno if I should popularize it though, otherwise people are going to crawl every game_id sequentially.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:47:50] <j3camero>	Fuuuuuu....
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:47:58] <a1k0n>	j3camero: well that is what i did last contest..
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:07] <a1k0n>	but not sequentually, i scraped the top-100 players
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:17] <j3camero>	a1k0n: yeah no biggie: I will keep an eye on the bandwidth and buy more if necessary.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:22] <Mathnerd314>	j3camero: just be nice and provide a compressed copy of all the games :p
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:34] <j3camero>	Mathnerd314: good idea.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:48] <j3camero>	Mathnerd314: maybe daily data files?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:54] <Mathnerd314>	yeah, sounds good
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:48:58] <a1k0n>	argh the java applet gets into a mode in my browser where it stops loading any new games
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:49:14] <a1k0n>	a data feed like that would be most excellent.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:49:37] <a1k0n>	especially since a statistical analysis might be necessary play well
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:49:48] <j3camero>	a1k0n for sure
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:50:04] <j3camero>	checking bandwidth usage...
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:50:22] <j3camero>	If we go over 5 TB on the month we're fucked. And by fucked I mean I would have to pay them more money.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:50:40] <a1k0n>	can you put google ads up?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:50:48] <Zaphus>	can you include the map itself in the normal map format ?   the playback string is in a different format to the map files
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:51:03] <a1k0n>	Zaphus: chop off everything in front of the |
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:51:07] <a1k0n>	oh that is different nm
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:51:48] <jmcarthur>	yeah i think perhaps if we simply encourage people to use torrents of the game logs then the bandwidth wouldn't be a big deal :)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:51:54] <a1k0n>	but the format is similar; grab everything up to the |, then split lines at : and turn , into space and prepend a P to each line
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:52:23] <jmcarthur>	like, just put up a new one each week or so
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:52:27] <Mathnerd314>	j3camero: jmcarthur's idea seems awesome :p
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:52:29] <a1k0n>	good idea.  just put a torrent tracker up and only post .torrents
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:53:55] <a1k0n>	issue 64 is a dupe of 23
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:54:26] <j3camero>	jmcarthur: yep I'm pretty sure I will have to post regular datafiles.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:54:46] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: no. 23 is about tournament, 64 is about game.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:54:58] <jmcarthur>	j3camero: especially after a1k0n blogged about data mining after winning the last one! :P
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:55:10] <a1k0n>	oops i mean 68
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:55:28] <contestbot>	Top 10 players: albert(522), cheese_bot(484), a1k0n_(369), UloPee(338), zaphus(307), inverselimit(192), mistabell(178), galcon(118), j3camero(-7), Max(-16)
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:56:22] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: if you are a committer for the project, you should be able to resolve those as duplicates
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:56:36] <Mathnerd314>	but will j3camero let you resolve them as duplicates?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:56:39] <a1k0n>	i can't seem to do anything on the issue tracker

[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:57:27] <j3camero>	a1k0n: oh damn. I think you should be able to resolve issues. Is there a way for me to enable you on the issue tracker?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:57:43] <a1k0n>	maybe?  i have no idea
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:57:56] <j3camero>	haha I missed a decimal point and thought we used 3 TB of bandwidth today. Fuck me I almost lost it. That would have cost a lot of money.
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:58:09] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: go to issue, click in textbox "add or make changes", do you get issue fields to edit?
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:58:18] <Zannick>	a1k0n: click "add a comment and make changes"
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:58:35] <a1k0n>	oh hah duh
[Wednesday 08 September 2010] [23:58:39] <a1k0n>	yep, thanks
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:00:32] <j3camero>	Sweet.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:00:46] <j3camero>	Nice a1k0n. I am so glad to have you helping out, even if just a little bit.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:01:03] <Mathnerd314>	j3camero: you could have a bandwidth usage meter
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:01:12] <a1k0n>	cool.  though you have some much better contributors already.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:01:23] <j3camero>	Okay, so according to my math, we can have 20M pageviews per month and not get fucked on bandwidth. This is good news. If we get 20M pageviews, I would gladly pay for more bandwidth.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:01:41] <a1k0n>	if you get 20M pageviews, google ads will pay for more bandwidth
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:01:54] <j3camero>	This is true. Do you think people would hate me for using google ads?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:02:11] <j3camero>	Well whatever. We will consider ads later. For now I am not worrying about it.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:02:23] <a1k0n>	on the google ai challenge?  i wouldn't mind if the bandwidth were an issue
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:02:36] <a1k0n>	fair enough
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:02:45] <a1k0n>	i badly want a rematch against albert on the official server
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:02:48] <Mathnerd314>	j3camero: channel is getting large enough that you might consider publicly logging it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:03:31] <Mathnerd314>	amstan already has a bot, so you just need to put up logs somewhere

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:04:14] <amstan>	Mathnerd314: logging? why?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:05:29] <Mathnerd314>	so people can see what happened while they were gone. not everyone has a server they can keep running all day.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:05:45] <jmcarthur>	and even those who do lose power sometimes *ahem*

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:07:00] <amstan>	Mathnerd314: ok, will consider
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:07:15] <amstan>	Mathnerd314: sometimes in the next week..
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:07:23] <Mathnerd314>	amstan: should I make an issue in the tracker to remind you?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:07:31] <jmcarthur>	weechat in a tmux session on my htpc, here
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:07:43] <amstan>	Mathnerd314: that's fine, i'm constantly reminded when i use the bot
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:07:52] <Mathnerd314>	amstan: or add it to the bot feature request list on the forum?

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:09] <jmcarthur>	i was about to say that's an *insane* number of page views
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:26] <Zannick>	well
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:30] <jmcarthur>	it still is
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:33] <Zannick>	i think something is wrong with my java compiler
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:34] <jmcarthur>	but not *that* insane
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:36] <Zannick>	how. lovely
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:41] <jmcarthur>	rock
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:55] <amstan>	Mathnerd314: i was thinking to make a bot based on http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:58] <jmcarthur>	@faq Can Haskell compile better than Java?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:09:58] <lambdabot>	The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:10:06] <Zannick>	it is complaining about things that are "only available if source level is 5.0"
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:10:18] <jmcarthur>	"source level"? what's that?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:10:23] <Zannick>	as in, java 5.0
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:10:25] <jmcarthur>	ah
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:10:34] <Zannick>	as in, things that have been out for what, 7 years?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:10:47] <Mathnerd314>	amstan: never tried setting up a bot, so whatever you think of.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:11:03] <amstan>	Mathnerd314: same software #ubuntu uses for their bot
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:11:09] <amstan>	i think it also does logging
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:11:33] <lambdabot>	i can't log, unfortunately :(
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:11:48] <amstan>	lambdabot: you sure? you have a log module
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:11:57] <amstan>	lambdabot: also.. who's your master?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:12:23] <lambdabot>	i shall never say
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:12:33] <amstan>	lambdabot: you should.. i'm op
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:12:39] <Mathnerd314>	amstan: AFAIK jmcarthur is

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:12:52] <amstan>	apparently he's not
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:12:52] <jmcarthur>	well, i'm the one making lambdabot talk, but i'm not lambdabot's master
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:12:57] <j3camero>	Okay going to bed. Believe it or not, I have averted many crises today, despite the fact that I fixed zero issues.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:13:11] <mightybyte>	j3camero: I've got a fix for you.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:13:13] <amstan>	j3camero: lol
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:13:30] <jmcarthur>	i merely have the authority to make lambdabot do a few things that most people can't. i do not actually run the bot
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:13:31] <amstan>	j3camero: you think we can still launch tomorrow?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:13:44] <amstan>	jmcarthur: ok.. well.. i just want to know who it is
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:14:01] <amstan>	not that i want it off, especially if ppl use it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:14:19] <j3camero>	mightybyte: oh if you've got a code review I will do it before bed so you're not blocked.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:14:51] <mightybyte>	Give me one second to upload a patch.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:14:56] <a1k0n>	amstan: tomorrow is thursday
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:15:07] <a1k0n>	or are you launching midnight GMT?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:15:08] <amstan>	a1k0n: darn

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:15:50] <mightybyte>	And I just verified that it fixes issues 73
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:15:52] <j3camero>	mightybyte: can you put the patch into an issue so that I find it tomorrow? I pretty much have to fix all the urgent issues tomorrow no matter what.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:10] <a1k0n>	that's a roll-up of patches already attached to issues
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:16] <mightybyte>	Yeah, I can do that.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:27] <a1k0n>	i can commit them all to a branch if you like
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:34] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: Yes, but those patches conflicted, so I had to resolve them manually.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:42] <a1k0n>	ahh
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:42] <j3camero>	Going to bed now. Thanks so much for the help! If anyone finds other people who want to be committers, email me jeff@ai-contest.com.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:56] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: Can you just commit the patch now so I don't have to file another issue?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:16:59] <tapwater>	who is running example bot?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:02] <tapwater>	example bot needs to die
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:11] <tapwater>	it needs to die with fire
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:12] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: Or should i still file the roll-up issue with the patch?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:14] <a1k0n>	i can't commit to trunk but i can make a branch to resolve those issues
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:23] <Mathnerd314>	tapwater: blame sleeping dhartmei
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:27] <j3camero>	a1k0n: if you feel up to it, you could create a branch with a bunch of fixes in it, and we can review it tomorrow. I can maybe even sneak in a review in the morning while I am at work so you're not blocked.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:17:40] <a1k0n>	ok.  i'll do that, and the issue tracking admin stuff
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:18:10] <mightybyte>	a1k0n: Ok.  You're getting my patch from the above link, or do you want me to do something else with it?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:18:17] <j3camero>	Nice a1k0n. You da man. So much for not getting sucked in.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:18:27] <a1k0n>	from your resolved patch link.  thanks.

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:41:14] <antimatroid1>	yep, i don't really mind which way it goes, provided it works and is fair :P
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:45:03] <Mathnerd314>	like, say A sends 10000 ships, B sends 9999 ships,C (neutral) has 2 ships.

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:45:40] <Mathnerd314>	IMO, C is neutral, so it doesn't get attacked until A and B fight it out
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:46:00] <a1k0n>	yeah, in fact as written that isn't right
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:46:35] <antimatroid1>	wait. what happens if (20,10) arrives on a neutral planet with 20 ships?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:47:02] <antimatroid1>	i think that's unfair
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:47:16] <antimatroid1>	if it's causing player 1 and player 2 to both lose all their ships
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:47:19] <a1k0n>	yeah that patch is wrong
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:47:40] <a1k0n>	as written it treats the defense as just another 'fleet'
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:47:57] <a1k0n>	so a neutral with 20 attacked by 20 and 10 simultaneously means there's a tie for the two 20 fleets and the 10 gets it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:06] <antimatroid1>	no
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:10] <Zannick>	no, that patch means no one gets it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:10] <a1k0n>	or actually the 10 just doesn't get anything
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:13] <antimatroid1>	i would say player 2 ends up with the planet
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:15] <antimatroid1>	in a fair game
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:24] <antimatroid1>	player 1**

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:48:54] <antimatroid1>	hmmm, now i'm not sure what the best way is to run the 3 way battle
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:49:05] <antimatroid1>	amstan: did you just read the above?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:49:34] <amstan>	antimatroid1: i am not sure, i saw a suggestion of fighting red and blue before fighting with neutral
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:50:57] <antimatroid1>	i think that pairing off half ships to battle thing might be best
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:51:01] <antimatroid1>	are there any problem cases for that?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:51:06] <a1k0n>	i think fairest would be to repeatedly eliminate the smallest fleet with the next-smallest
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:51:09] <antimatroid1>	my one had an issue in the end
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:51:50] <a1k0n>	with ties going to attackers instead of defenders
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:52:12] <a1k0n>	(meaning attackers get eliminated first)
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:52:29] <tapwater>	a1k0n: good match http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284007587|a1k0n|cheese_bot

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:54:20] <tapwater>	antimatroid1: I don't see it as a bummer, I see it as a goal :)
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:54:45] <a1k0n>	it shouldn't be that hard to beat this bot

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:55:28] <tapwater>	haha no offense taken
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:55:35] <tapwater>	the real fun part is incrementally improving your own bot
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:55:41] <a1k0n>	yeah
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:55:45] <tapwater>	and watching it get better and better
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:56:00] <a1k0n>	yeah it's way more fun when you have a lot of competitors to judge it against
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:56:20] <tapwater>	yup
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:56:35] <a1k0n>	i'm basically astonished mine is doing so well
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:56:39] <tapwater>	if it wasn't for the unofficial tcp server, my bot would suck even harder
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [00:56:51] <a1k0n>	yeah, i probably wouldn't have won last time without it

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:00:43] <Mathnerd314>	a1k0n: I think it's proposal (3)

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:00:55] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: he at least intended to do the third i think
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:01:22] <antimatroid1>	jmcarthur: with the third option, what about when (20,10) arrives at a neutral planet with 20 ships?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:01:28] <Mathnerd314>	maybe we can resolve this with a friendly game of Galcon
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:01:37] <a1k0n>	for a player to take a planet, doesn't the sum of its fleets need to be greater than the sum of all other arriving fleets and the defending fleet?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:01:45] <jmcarthur>	antimatroid1: that would be all three sides die
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:01:53] <antimatroid1>	i don't like that
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:02:41] <antimatroid1>	i think expansion should perhaps be encouraged? so I would put my vote in for players ships fighting neutral then each other
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:03:18] <jmcarthur>	the first option would have neutral left with 10. the second would have a player left with 5.

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:04:20] <jmcarthur>	for one, option 2 is the most difficult to reason about

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:04:38] <a1k0n>	seigen-web: hoho
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:04:48] <tapwater>	I don't see how it will discourage expansion
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:04:50] <jmcarthur>	in fact, i am certain i got one of the properties about option 2 wrong in that post
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:06] <jmcarthur>	tapwater: because neutral will be very powerful in a 3-way
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:07] <seigen-web>	a1k0n: actually, it's been nice, as i completely rewrite my jenks
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:14] <seigen-web>	a1k0n: to have a good benchmark
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:26] <a1k0n>	wow gheesebot takes the lead on the official server

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:45] <jmcarthur>	a1k0n: let's see... if both players team up on neutral first, then neutral will take 10 from each of them. yeah, you're right
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:45] <antimatroid1>	i think there was a problem with my old reasoning for option 2
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:05:58] <seigen-web>	a1k0n: pretty basic?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:06:04] <tapwater>	jmcarthur: should we worry about 3 ways?
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:06:05] <a1k0n>	it's stupid simple
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:06:21] <jmcarthur>	tapwater: yeah. i'd say how that case is handled is pretty important
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:06:30] <a1k0n>	no prediction at all, just basic accounting
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:06:45] <tapwater>	for the contest, I think we should focus on 1v1

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:07:41] <antimatroid1>	i'm curious as to whether the number of starting home planets is fixed at one, so far I've just been told not to count on it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:03] <seigen-web>	a1k0n: yeah.  I got prematurely fancy and tried to keep my fleet centralized
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:04] <jmcarthur>	i am just playing the "don't count on it" game. i don't think it will drastically effect my strategy
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:23] <jmcarthur>	unlike number of turns...
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:26] <a1k0n>	i threw together the simplest thing that could possibly work last night
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:26] <seigen-web>	i.e., weighted targets by their distance to the centroid of my fleet.  But, i don't play defence
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:38] <a1k0n>	added two lines of code today that seemed to improve it, that's it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:08:57] <seigen-web>	yeah.
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:09:04] <a1k0n>	yeah, i'm sure there are some improvements to target selection that could be done
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:09:10] <a1k0n>	i just grab for growth
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:09:32] <seigen-web>	i'm still pretty much doing the same simple thing that i was doing, but i rewrote it to do a few more things at once.

[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:14:25] <jmcarthur>	there's a tradeoff between speed and expressiveness that i like having around
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:14:42] <jmcarthur>	and the tradeoff isn't as bad as it may lead some to think, anyway
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:16:24] <antimatroid1>	hmmmm, resolve this case for me
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:16:25] <antimatroid1>	(6,3) arriving at neutral with 7 ships
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:16:35] <antimatroid1>	or think about it anyway
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:17:09] <a1k0n>	i think fighting each other first is easiest to resolve and fair and the bias isn't that bad
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:17:19] <a1k0n>	so neutral wins with 4 ships
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:18:17] <antimatroid1>	i think i'd have to agree, but only because of the ease of resolving it
[Thursday 09 September 2010] [01:18:39] <antimatroid1>	i think it's more likely to lead to deadlocks
