2011-07-13T02:58:53  <_flag> I think it ignores the Makefile so if you rely on some special compiling procedures keep that in mind
2011-07-13T02:59:15  <_flag> It also needs a MyBot.cpp file

2011-07-13T03:15:59  <bhasker> it times out while compiling

2011-07-13T09:11:01  <mcstar> after watching my suicidal bot, i guess its not a bad idea to sometimes just go bezerk, and attack anything that moves, and later regain territory and food
2011-07-13T09:11:47  <antimatroid> i would be a lot more defensive if i feel like i'm "behind" on ants
2011-07-13T09:12:27  <antimatroid> has anyone thought about using "scouter ants" to lead enemies away from the bulk of your army/territory?
2011-07-13T09:12:43  <mcstar> decoy?
2011-07-13T09:12:47  <antimatroid> yep
2011-07-13T09:12:58  <mcstar> no, im not there yet

2011-07-13T09:13:01  <antimatroid> so if you're trying to regenerate your numbers, try to keep enemies from seeing you
2011-07-13T09:13:30  <antimatroid> well, the bulk of you
2011-07-13T09:13:37  <mcstar> to do this right, i think it needs a pretty good framework
2011-07-13T09:13:44  <mcstar> (logic framework that is)
2011-07-13T09:14:16  <antimatroid> if you had a decoy ant, you'd search outwards avoiding squares in vision of you or attackable by them
2011-07-13T09:14:27  <antimatroid> in vision of your other ants that is :P
2011-07-13T09:15:02  <mcstar> yeah, but to select those ants, to give them consistent(between turns) tagets and such is a mess if you dont have a nice framewrok
2011-07-13T09:15:15  <antimatroid> what do you mean by framework?
2011-07-13T09:15:25  <mcstar> well, a control strucutre
2011-07-13T09:15:34  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-07-13T09:15:45  <antimatroid> i build the structure of my bot around what i want to do though
2011-07-13T09:15:50  <antimatroid> so i try and think about this stuff first
2011-07-13T09:15:57  <mcstar> right now, im experimenting with recursive resolvers
2011-07-13T09:15:58  <antimatroid> i'm not sure i'm going to have time to write a bot anyway though
2011-07-13T09:16:14  <bhasker> your bot seems to be doing pretty well already though
2011-07-13T09:16:18  <mcstar> well, i hope ypi will
2011-07-13T09:16:23  <mcstar> ypi->you
2011-07-13T09:16:32  <bhasker> as for mcstar my bot doesn't try and stay away from enemy it just doesn't go in and commit suicide if it can avoid it
2011-07-13T09:16:38  <antimatroid> that bot just does food and enemy collection, skipping on the enemy collection if it thinks it's behind
2011-07-13T09:16:43  <bhasker> sometimes it still makes mistakes
2011-07-13T09:17:07  <bhasker> mainly because of my path generation code which only looks at '1 shortest path' when doing battle resolution
2011-07-13T09:17:47  <antimatroid> the bot i want to write has much more elaborate path finding ideas and uses game trees to pick battle moves, which takes a lot of time to write and get working, particularly when ones going to need to work out how the hell to get anything from game trees in time
2011-07-13T09:17:56  <bhasker> my bot has no such controls yet, it does food always first if no food, then enemy if nothing then explore
2011-07-13T09:18:13  <bhasker> well my bot's battle resolution is kinda simple right now
2011-07-13T09:18:24  <bhasker> but seems to work reasonably well
2011-07-13T09:18:46  <antimatroid> bhasker: what are you doing for collecting food? the main thing i do which i like is reusing ants after i've collected food, along with future "to spawn ants" at food locations i've already "collected that turn"
2011-07-13T09:19:07  <antimatroid> bhasker: are you just taking information about the border of where their enemies could attack?
2011-07-13T09:19:09  <bhasker> i don't do any prediction
2011-07-13T09:19:28  <bhasker> well mostly my bot simulates its steps
2011-07-13T09:19:35  <bhasker> it decides it wants to attack say ant X
2011-07-13T09:19:42  <bhasker> then it steps each of my ants one step closer to X
2011-07-13T09:19:47  <bhasker> whichever are involved in the attack
2011-07-13T09:20:10  <bhasker> then for each ants new location it finds nearby enemies and steps them one step closer to that ant
2011-07-13T09:20:24  <bhasker> then it does battle resolution to figure out if the move is good/okay/bad
2011-07-13T09:20:28  <bhasker> etc
2011-07-13T09:20:28  <antimatroid> oh, and it wont collect the same piece of food with more than one ant
2011-07-13T09:20:35  <bhasker> yes it doesn't
2011-07-13T09:20:42  <mcstar> F this sh*t
2011-07-13T09:20:48  <mcstar> im sorry i found my stupid bug
2011-07-13T09:20:49  <bhasker> well it tries to sometimes
2011-07-13T09:21:08  <bhasker> mostly my bot tries and finds the closest ant
2011-07-13T09:21:32  <antimatroid> mcstar: planet wars especially had the feel of who had the best bugs sometimes :)
2011-07-13T09:21:36  <bhasker> though my food searches are all local around the current ant
2011-07-13T09:21:49  <antimatroid> my maze map generator has a bug that i have no intentions of fixing
2011-07-13T09:21:52  <bhasker> i don't for example find a food and route my closest ant to it
2011-07-13T09:21:59  <bhasker> each ant just finds food nearby and routes it
2011-07-13T09:22:06  <mcstar> antimatroid: you like the result?
2011-07-13T09:22:23  <antimatroid> mcstar: yeah, sometimes you get like a wall through the map, or the edges just match up really weird
2011-07-13T09:22:27  <bhasker> planetwars was awesome
2011-07-13T09:22:30  <antimatroid> but it creates more dynamic maps
2011-07-13T09:22:34  <bhasker> especially with bots that would send fleets back and forth
2011-07-13T09:22:36  <antimatroid> planetwars and tron were awesome
2011-07-13T09:22:50  <bhasker> and the best staging planet stuff was awesome to watch
2011-07-13T09:22:59  <bhasker> launching those massive attacks and flooding was awesome
2011-07-13T09:23:13  <bhasker> it would be fun to watch the pile up of ships
2011-07-13T09:23:14  <bhasker> and then wham
2011-07-13T09:23:31  <bhasker> there was a lot of predicitve stuff one could do in planetwars
2011-07-13T09:23:34  <bhasker> in ants not so much
2011-07-13T09:23:46  <bhasker> since you can always course correct next move
2011-07-13T09:23:53  <bhasker> planetwars you didn't have the luxury to do so

2011-07-13T09:24:22  <antimatroid> bhasker: you had a very good record against my bot in pw :P
2011-07-13T09:24:34  <bhasker> not the final version that you uploaded i think
2011-07-13T09:24:38  <bhasker> that one worked much better
2011-07-13T09:25:07  <antimatroid> that was the final version :P
2011-07-13T09:25:20  <antimatroid> it was very broken
2011-07-13T09:25:24  <antimatroid> the game tree is so broken it's not funny

2011-07-13T09:26:08  <bhasker> planetwars is so much more fun to watch
2011-07-13T09:26:09  <bhasker> than ants
2011-07-13T09:26:14  <bhasker> i find ant games really boring to watch
2011-07-13T09:26:19  <antimatroid> i came up with a new idea for my game tree on the day, implemented it wrong (memory leak problems even) yet it still managed 36th
2011-07-13T09:26:24  <antimatroid> yeah i agree
2011-07-13T09:26:34  <antimatroid> i'm hoping smarter bots will make it more interesting
2011-07-13T09:26:44  <antimatroid> planet wars games can be pretty dull too
2011-07-13T09:26:45  <bhasker> i think higher food spawn rates will also make games faster
2011-07-13T09:26:56  <bhasker> the current food spawn rate can be really slow to take off
2011-07-13T09:27:03  <bhasker> bots take like 40-50 turns before anything happens
2011-07-13T09:27:07  <bhasker> in 1-1 games
2011-07-13T09:27:23  <bhasker> well pw was visually more entertaining when the attacks did happen
2011-07-13T09:27:28  <bhasker> you see these massive arrows converge
2011-07-13T09:27:35  <bhasker> and you see these beautiful supply lines

2011-07-13T09:34:03  <bhasker> on last day he won a couple more games than me and ended up 1 rank higher or something
2011-07-13T09:34:06  <bhasker> our bots had the same elo

2011-07-13T09:49:23  <bhasker> i should build some app on ec2

2011-07-13T10:18:45  <bhasker> heh yea been trying since yesterday night
2011-07-13T10:18:48  <bhasker> almost every compile timed out
2011-07-13T10:19:29  <bhasker> maybe we should change the compile options from an -03 to an -02
2011-07-13T10:19:51  <bhasker> O3 is way more expensive in cpu time for little improvement over -02
2011-07-13T10:20:25  <bhasker> only 3 more optimizations are turned on
2011-07-13T10:20:26  <bhasker>  -O3 Optimize yet more.  -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2 and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops and -fgcse-after-reload options.
2011-07-13T10:21:30  <bhasker> but i guess -finline/funswitch are useful for faster performance of the bots itself
2011-07-13T10:23:29  <eashoka> Isn't bandwidth the real issue here ? if I had money, would have donate a server ;-)

2011-07-13T13:07:28  <Pkpo> Does someone is using c# for the ants contest ?
2011-07-13T13:10:14  <Pkpo> can i find someone alive ? :)
2011-07-13T13:16:26  <eashoka> Pkpo : seems like ppl alive are not using c# :-)
2011-07-13T13:17:51  <Pkpo> yeah unfortunately :(  and my problem is for local testing..... it works with python bot but it crashed with my csharp bot :(

2011-07-13T13:20:24  <Pkpo> is there an easy way to debug python ? just to see why it crash ?
2011-07-13T13:21:28  <mcstar> Pkpo: add -e -E to playgame.py in play_one_game.sh
2011-07-13T13:21:54  <Pkpo> the same things on windows ?
2011-07-13T13:25:11  <Pkpo> yeah thanks i've some logs !
2011-07-13T13:25:42  <berak> Pkpo, yes, same. for c#, use try /catch blocks, and write exceptions to stderr. the above options will log them to an error log
2011-07-13T13:26:39  <Pkpo> i've already done it but i think it's a compilation problem, and that's what the log seems to tell me :)
2011-07-13T13:27:11  <mcstar> ? compilation problem when you try to run it?
2011-07-13T13:27:27  <mcstar> berak: people were asking about a tcp server :)
2011-07-13T13:27:37  <Pkpo> i try locally
2011-07-13T13:27:59  <berak> mcstar, mine wasnt good, i guess
2011-07-13T13:28:24  <mcstar> but are you going to make one? or make the mods. mcleo was talking about?
2011-07-13T13:29:12  <Pkpo> i guess you're not talking to me..... ?
2011-07-13T13:31:23  <mcstar> no
2011-07-13T13:31:50  <Pkpo> ok :)
2011-07-13T13:32:33  <berak> mcstar, hmmm, mcleo wasn't specially pleased with what i did there. as of now, it still means hacking into engine.py (with every update..), since it is still creating the sandboxes.
2011-07-13T13:33:12  <berak> mcstar, short answer: think i burnt my fingers, posting prematurely there
2011-07-13T13:33:34  <Pkpo> correct me if i'm wrong, if i invoke playgame.py with that "csc D:tools\sample_bots\csharp\GreedyBot.cs" for my bot, it will try to compile it with the csc compiler ? and -e -E didn't help, apparently it compile but it crash on the first turn :(
2011-07-13T13:33:47  <mcstar> berak: i dont see it that way, it was a good initiative, but yeah, needs work :)
2011-07-13T13:34:21  <mcstar> Pkpo: hm, i guess you need to compile first, to an executable, and put its path there
2011-07-13T13:34:29  <berak> mcstar, thanks for cheering me up, i'll reconsider it
2011-07-13T13:34:54  <mcstar> sure, cheering up is free :)
2011-07-13T13:35:00  <Pkpo> ooooohhhh i have to put the exe file.... ?
2011-07-13T13:35:05  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-13T13:36:15  <mcstar> python is mainly interpreted, so you need to use "python script.py", but for compiled languages you need the executable
2011-07-13T13:42:37  <Pkpo> sure ? 'cause the result is different since i try "csc D:tools\sample_bots\csharp\GreedyBot.cs" or "mcs D:tools\sample_bots\csharp\GreedyBot.cs" (different compiler, the first from microsoft, the second from mono, the first just tell me that bot 3 didn't started and the second give a compilation erro (like error CS4637
2011-07-13T13:44:07  <berak> Pkpo, first compile your prog to exe, then use that exe to play a game
2011-07-13T13:44:58  <mcstar> im quite sure
2011-07-13T13:45:33  <mcstar> and pls, just do what we say, and dont try to compile your prg. in the play_one_game.cmd script
2011-07-13T13:47:01  <Pkpo> ok, it was just few things i noticed, i compiled it, just put "D:\tools\sample_bots\csharp\MyBot.exe" and it works ! thanks !

2011-07-13T19:19:11  <janzert> yes, we should have more than 11
2011-07-13T19:19:42  <janzert> not sure what happened so far as I see nothing changed but it seems to have frozen showing on those 11 about a day ago
2011-07-13T19:19:56  <janzert> my first guess is something went haywire with the memcache?

2011-07-13T20:12:00  <jmcarthur> re: -O3 being much more expensive during compile time than -O2... are you sure it's really that much cost? admittedly, the gains are usually pretty small, but every once in a while it's a huge gain (when the planets align), and i was never under the impression that it hurt that much as far as compile time

2011-07-13T21:15:15  <bhasker> we can try but i believe that -03 does increase compilation times quite a bit
2011-07-13T21:15:35  <bhasker> though in this case its 1 time compilation cost at the benefit of probably runtime improvements
2011-07-13T21:17:41  *** onensora <onensora!c@e198153.upc-e.chello.nl> has quit IRC ()
2011-07-13T21:39:49  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's what i mean to get at
2011-07-13T21:40:11  <jmcarthur> even if it increases compile time a lot, it's not really that substantial at all
2011-07-13T21:40:38  <jmcarthur> and surely gcc is one of the *faster* compilers anyway ;)
2011-07-13T21:42:12  <jmcarthur> it takes me 7.5 seconds to build my bot, and i don't even have much code in it yet
2011-07-13T21:42:24  <jmcarthur> it's basically just a starter right now
