2011-12-20T00:00:17  <rwest_> ugh
2011-12-20T00:00:30  <Antimony> My bot just suicided a bunch of ants in a battle http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=284265&user=3845
2011-12-20T00:00:34  <avdg> wow, that bot was very lucky in the last game
2011-12-20T00:03:39  <BenJackson> oh wow that's a crap map
2011-12-20T00:03:59  <thestinger> lol, my bot is good on those
2011-12-20T00:04:04  <ChrisH_> so I'm looking through the rankings for low ranking bots that have won most of their games and I found this one ranked at 1705 with 3 wins and a 2nd place: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=1784
2011-12-20T00:04:19  <BenJackson> thestinger: maps where there's a chokepoint between the two bases at nearly minimum distance?
2011-12-20T00:04:23  <thestinger> because it cares so much about gathering food
2011-12-20T00:04:28  <thestinger> yeah, there were some of those on tcp
2011-12-20T00:04:46  <thestinger> remember there was one where I only won because I got an ant out?
2011-12-20T00:05:01  <thestinger> I suck at mazes like that though
2011-12-20T00:05:07  <thestinger> it's hard to say if my bot would be good at that
2011-12-20T00:05:24  <thestinger> it might just clog the corridor
2011-12-20T00:05:34  <ChrisH_> and here's one with 3 firsts and a second ranked 2154: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=13537
2011-12-20T00:06:16  <BenJackson> thestinger: but that whole map is literally a race for that 1st ant
2011-12-20T00:06:28  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, that's the part my bot is good at
2011-12-20T00:06:34  <BenJackson> mine probably is too
2011-12-20T00:06:42  <BenJackson> but it really only tests that one thing
2011-12-20T00:06:56  <thestinger> the first foragers will never go backwards or waste time forming lines to block the enemy
2011-12-20T00:07:10  <BenJackson> "waste time"
2011-12-20T00:07:15  <BenJackson> can you even get by?
2011-12-20T00:07:19  <BenJackson> without cooperation?
2011-12-20T00:07:27  <BenJackson> it's not wide enough

2011-12-20T00:11:26  <a1k0n> haha wow
2011-12-20T00:11:54  <a1k0n> greentea enumerates moves exhaustively in battle subgroups when theyre small enough
2011-12-20T00:12:27  <thestinger> a1k0n: for each enemy and himself?
2011-12-20T00:12:48  <a1k0n> it looks like just his own?  unsure, but no more than 7 ants
2011-12-20T00:13:08  <a1k0n> which is reasonable
2011-12-20T00:13:21  <Antimony> mine will enumerate moves exhaustively if given enough time
2011-12-20T00:13:31  <Antimony> for itself. it only considers 5 moves for the enemy

2011-12-20T00:16:34  <thestinger> I'm curious about how bots using the memetix-style combat will do
2011-12-20T00:16:41  <thestinger> I bet a lot of people implemented that
2011-12-20T00:16:46  <McLeopold> _flag: yes, have you seen my replays on paste?
2011-12-20T00:16:51  <BenJackson> yeah, that was the downside of posting it
2011-12-20T00:16:55  <ChrisH_> I came up with a formula that would quickly estimate how many positions a battle could produce
2011-12-20T00:17:01  <_flag> McLeopold: No
2011-12-20T00:17:06  <BenJackson> I think the variety of other combat is more interesting
2011-12-20T00:17:09  <a1k0n> oh nice
2011-12-20T00:17:40  <ChrisH_> a1k0n: I plan to explain it in my writeup
2011-12-20T00:17:43  <a1k0n> yeah if you count redundant positions only once you get a lot more mileage
2011-12-20T00:17:52  <ChrisH_> a1k0n: yes
2011-12-20T00:18:04  <a1k0n> shit i should have added a cache for that
2011-12-20T00:18:11  <Antimony> did anyone else take a constraint satisfaction approach?
2011-12-20T00:18:15  <_flag> McLeopold: Can you link me to it/them?
2011-12-20T00:18:20  <McLeopold> _flag: looking...
2011-12-20T00:18:44  <ChrisH_> a1k0n: and I also reshuffle the order I test enemy positions to move the best ones so far to the top of the list to enhance A-B pruning's efficiency

2011-12-20T00:19:33  <a1k0n> greentea orders moves too
2011-12-20T00:19:47  <thestinger> it let me stop generating more than one move for the opponent without ruining my combat

2011-12-20T00:27:59  <amstan> then you use ffmpeg to make the movie
2011-12-20T00:28:13  <_flag> Ah, but the java visualizer can't do the debugging thing that McLeopold was talking about, right?

2011-12-20T00:33:12  <ChrisH_> it would be a shame for a ~100 bot to miss the cutoff because of a bad first game and then not getting credit for their best win
2011-12-20T00:33:41  <amstan> you could say the same about a game that was lost and not credited
2011-12-20T00:33:46  <ChrisH_> yes
2011-12-20T00:34:04  <amstan> it's not about people not getting points for winning, it's about introducing noise in the rankings
2011-12-20T00:34:09  <ChrisH_> and the irony for this particular bot is that the first game it lost was to one of the bots it beat in it's last game before finals
2011-12-20T00:34:53  <ChrisH_> amstan: I think it's about both
2011-12-20T00:34:55  <amstan> that bot could have updated
2011-12-20T00:34:58  <thestinger> the starter bots could just be dropped by comparing files
2011-12-20T00:35:07  <amstan> thestinger: compare them to what?
2011-12-20T00:35:29  <ChrisH_> amstan: you mean the one he lost to in the first game?
2011-12-20T00:35:39  <amstan> ChrisH_: maybe, idk
2011-12-20T00:35:52  <ChrisH_> amstan: well, I know that bot's owner personally and it wasn't updated
2011-12-20T00:36:27  <amstan> what i'm saying is that you could have had the case where you lost a game and it didn't count as well
2011-12-20T00:36:39  <ChrisH_> but I would say that with the limited amount of games most bots are getting right now, not getting points for a win hurts a lot
2011-12-20T00:36:49  <ChrisH_> amstan: yeah, I agree with that
2011-12-20T00:36:50  <amstan> so not getting counted for the win happens only half the time if it does

2011-12-20T00:43:35  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=6158 <- starter bot with sigma barely over 2
2011-12-20T00:43:41  <thestinger> mine just changed from 7k to 1.6k mins after a refresh
2011-12-20T00:43:50  <thestinger> it's been maybe an hour :)
2011-12-20T00:43:56  <BenJackson> 37 skill seems high for a starter bot, the mus are going to be packed pretty tight on top if bots like that anchor it

2011-12-20T00:45:05  <thestinger> the starter bots remind me of sci-fi laser weaponry
2011-12-20T00:45:20  <thestinger> where you see the slow beam of light moving :P
2011-12-20T00:45:32  <BenJackson> this map was practically designed to put noise in the starter bot games: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=282891&user=6158
2011-12-20T00:46:07  <BenJackson> poor antiboty could have had free points with starter behavior
2011-12-20T00:46:49  <amstan> microsoft made no profit from anyone's zunes, lol
2011-12-20T00:47:33  <ChrisH_> anyway the profile I linked above is an example of a pretty good bot (~100 before finals) that seems to have some kind of combat skill when you watch it's matches, yet is currently ranked ~3000 due to the pairings it got
2011-12-20T00:49:22  <BenJackson> which one?
2011-12-20T00:49:35  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2507
2011-12-20T00:49:42  <ChrisH_> yeah, that one
2011-12-20T00:49:59  <thestinger> 82 mu before the skill reset
2011-12-20T00:51:11  <BenJackson> ah, he happened to get a 1st game with non-zombie opponents
2011-12-20T00:51:12  <ChrisH_> and it's first match in finals it got in a big game with two other decent bots, then it came in second by being late to hills in another game, won a game decisively that it didn't get credit for and won two more small games against poor competition for little mu benefit
2011-12-20T00:51:19  <BenJackson> until xytop timed out anyway
2011-12-20T00:51:50  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: and that "no credit" is important retroactively because it would have gotten stronger matchups
2011-12-20T00:51:57  <ChrisH_> exactly
2011-12-20T00:52:20  <BenJackson> let's hope he doesn't know how to use irc
2011-12-20T00:52:47  <thestinger> there's a nice webclient link on the homepage lol
2011-12-20T00:53:15  <ChrisH_> so it is very possible to have a good bot be very low in the ranks still, and I think we need a lot more games to sort this out, but getting credit for all the games we play is important too, so I hope they get that fixed soon
2011-12-20T00:53:42  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: there's probably some argument for how this is worse for mid tier bots
2011-12-20T00:53:51  <BenJackson> more mid tier opponents you might have randomly met early
2011-12-20T00:53:55  <BenJackson> and you're less dominant
2011-12-20T00:54:01  <ChrisH_> absolutely
2011-12-20T00:54:16  <BenJackson> whereas a top 10 player with a "tough" early matchup only has a 10/8000 chance of it being a loss anyway
2011-12-20T00:55:07  <BenJackson> by that measure I was going to poitn at nhaehnle who I beat in my 4th game, but his rank is decent
2011-12-20T00:56:09  <ChrisH_> I wonder if it is possible to write a query that would find the currently lowest ranking bot that was ever in the top 200 prior to finals
2011-12-20T00:56:45  <ChrisH_> (we really need a one word name for the period of time between beta and finals)
2011-12-20T00:57:56  <ChrisH_> the result of that query would be very interesting I think and informative about possible cutoff ranges
2011-12-20T00:57:57  <BenJackson> group stage
2011-12-20T00:58:12  <ChrisH_> xxxx not one word
2011-12-20T00:58:35  <BenJackson> nhaehnle has gotten some good games since we played
2011-12-20T00:58:38  <BenJackson> and he's 20th
2011-12-20T00:58:38  <ChrisH_> hey, there are more workers going now
2011-12-20T00:59:11  <thestinger> what does the % fail rate actually mean?
2011-12-20T00:59:14  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=285546&user=12357
2011-12-20T00:59:20  <ChrisH_> good, because it's been 11 hours since I had a game and I've still got 1673 people ahead of me
2011-12-20T00:59:21  <BenJackson> he has nice defensive saves in that one

2011-12-20T01:36:31  <ChrisH_> f4hy: no, the match maker is trying to "sort" the bots, so it would prefer to have a bunch that play more matches to act as landmarks in the rankings I think
2011-12-20T01:37:11  <f4hy> ChrisH_: oh... interesting. So I didn't get picked as a landmark, so I am stuck at 4 matches?
2011-12-20T01:37:22  <ChrisH_> and I *think* the code that tries to level the number of games over a 24 hour time period didn't kick in for the first day
2011-12-20T01:37:28  <janzert> ChrisH_: that's a pretty good summary of what the trueskill portion is trying to do
2011-12-20T01:38:03  <f4hy> if I give the matchmaker a dollar, can it choose me as a landmark ;-)

2011-12-20T01:38:29  <ChrisH_> janzert: I've written a system to let people rank songs by comparing them to each other and indicating which they like better, so I kinda know how these things have to "think" internally
2011-12-20T01:39:10  <BenJackson> so you're drawing some comparison between starter bots and nickleback
2011-12-20T01:39:30  <ChrisH_> f4hy: in addition, if you are a really good bot or a really bad bot you are less likely to get picked as a landmark because winning all your matches or losing them all puts you on the ends of the scale and that's not helpful for sorting other bots
2011-12-20T01:39:44  <ChrisH_> you will notice that all the bots that get a lot of games have won some and lost some
2011-12-20T01:39:46  <f4hy> ChrisH_: but I am neither of those!

2011-12-20T01:40:12  <janzert> also all the mu in the middle are very bunched up still
2011-12-20T01:40:38  <ChrisH_> and then not everyone will be a landmark, and landmarks will then get emphasized over other bots because they are already a stronger comparison, so it will snowball
2011-12-20T01:40:59  <ChrisH_> think of quicksort and how it picks a single pivot on each pass, trueskill just has more pivots
2011-12-20T01:41:42  <f4hy> That is fair. I just hope I get more matches
2011-12-20T01:42:20  <f4hy> you know, just like the data in a list wishes it gets to be the pivot

2011-12-20T01:49:56  <ChrisH_> antimatroid-sydn: there are two reasons:  1. there have been some problems with the DB that the admins have had to deal with and the workers have not been running at full speed the whole time since finals started

2011-12-20T01:50:38  <ChrisH_> antimatroid-sydn: and 2. the matching system is still trying to establish some baseline bot skills, so matches are not being evenly distributed yet
2011-12-20T01:51:28  <f4hy> ChrisH_: are you certain of that, or just good guess
2011-12-20T01:51:37  <Scryer> Like starter bots that get 10 or 12 in a row... :P

2011-12-20T01:53:40  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I guess you could look at whether some of the high game count bots are ones that came in mid-pack in the beginning

2011-12-20T01:56:28  <LouisMartin> are those currently playing a lot of games sooner to be able to estimate their final rank?

2011-12-20T02:01:58  <BenJackson> the kernel exposes a vdso which lets you link in platform specific syscall code
2011-12-20T02:02:07  <LouisMartin> after 25 games, do you guys think I may hang around that rank?  http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=7025
2011-12-20T02:02:11  <BenJackson> that's also how gettimeofday can now be done without a syscall

2011-12-20T02:02:36  <thestinger> BenJackson: bmh's bot almost worked though
2011-12-20T02:02:38  <bmh> BenJackson: my bot never queried the clock.
2011-12-20T02:02:50  <thestinger> just the stupid locale stuff is impossible to statically link against
2011-12-20T02:03:04  <bmh> "If I can't do this in 500ms, there's no sense in wasting cycles checking the clock."
2011-12-20T02:03:24  <thestinger> nice, I built Rust
2011-12-20T02:03:33  <thestinger> just had to sed all the 'python' to 'python3'
2011-12-20T02:03:42  <thestinger> I mean to python2
2011-12-20T02:03:44  <thestinger> :P
2011-12-20T02:04:19  <thestinger> really annoying because they dynamically create .py files...
2011-12-20T02:05:34  <LouisMartin> no opinion? :(   I'm just trying to not get excited and hoped someone could burst my bubble
2011-12-20T02:05:51  <bhasker> Louis how was your rank pre final?
2011-12-20T02:05:54  <Scryer> I put in a clock check to see whether I needed a clock check, and was aghast to see how little time I was using. Given another week or two I'd have used all that time on combat.
2011-12-20T02:06:06  <bhasker> unless you changed your bot dramatically i would expect you to be close to where you were prefinal
2011-12-20T02:06:21  <thestinger> well, I don't expect my bot to get in the top 10 at all
2011-12-20T02:06:40  <thestinger> I'm 80% sure it will be in the top 50, and I _hope_ it will be in the top 25
2011-12-20T02:07:15  <BenJackson> I'd say 99% sure you're in the top 50
2011-12-20T02:07:45  <BenJackson> based on counting off the top 10 I suspect you're outside the top 10
2011-12-20T02:07:49  <thestinger> BenJackson: my last upload before the finals discouraged me a bit
2011-12-20T02:07:58  <bmh> I notice that no one has played a game on my server in a couple of hours. I'm probably going to take it down.
2011-12-20T02:08:06  <BenJackson> the problem is that you had a lot of versions and no one is that familiar with 25-50
2011-12-20T02:08:13  <BenJackson> so hard to say where 25th is these days
2011-12-20T02:08:22  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-20T02:08:32  <LouisMartin> bhasker: the last version I uploaded was way better than the last one I got scored here which was going to stable at ~300.   the lastest one was doing in the 400 on fluxid in the last days.
2011-12-20T02:11:33  <f4hy> LouisMartin: then you shouled expect about the same or lower
2011-12-20T02:14:01  <BenJackson> in the 400 on fluxid is pretty meaningless
2011-12-20T02:14:09  <BenJackson> not good or bad, I mean
2011-12-20T02:14:17  <Scryer> Louis - is the pathfinding what you were expecting in http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=282965&user=7025 where you spend a couple of hundred turns looking yearningly across the water at yellow's hive?
2011-12-20T02:14:25  <BenJackson> there was too much junk in the db
2011-12-20T02:14:42  <thestinger> yeah, the burst of games on bmh's server near the end was great
2011-12-20T02:14:52  <LouisMartin> except if I improved my bot a lot after my last bot rank here.   on fluxid, my top300 bot where hardly scoring any points in game, them newer version began to do that (yea!) and the last one got to rank ~400.  fluxid ranks are way tougher to earn that on the contest server, so I'm hoping for a top150 position...
2011-12-20T02:15:17  <thestinger> BenJackson: there are a lot of bots that I've never seen on tcp, so I just wonder how many fall into the 10 to 50 range
2011-12-20T02:15:24  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-20T02:15:33  <BenJackson> I think the field is pretty crowded out to about 20
2011-12-20T02:15:43  <BenJackson> to absorb the top-10 and near-top-10 we know of
2011-12-20T02:16:11  <BenJackson> bias from the maps will probably permute things too
2011-12-20T02:16:12  <LouisMartin> Scryer: don't tell me about it :P   I changed 5 lines of code 5 minutes before uploading to the contest server....  I fixed a huge problem, but cause another one.
2011-12-20T02:16:41  <BenJackson> LouisMartin: this is why I was stressed about having to resubmit on saturday
2011-12-20T02:16:49  <BenJackson> I didn't want to get within 24h of the deadline
2011-12-20T02:17:10  <bhasker> i had a better version on saturday but sadly ran into a compiler issue with 4.5 tr1 not being the same as 4.1.2:-\
2011-12-20T02:17:18  <bmh> thestinger: as I said before -- shared vm, 1/40th of a physical box :-D
2011-12-20T02:17:22  <bhasker> and i was busy the whole day to spend time figuring it out
2011-12-20T02:17:25  <LouisMartin> Scryer: it's not about the pathfinding. It's about not ignoring ants that are out of reach in battle...   stupid bug that probably will cost me at least 100 positions if not more. I'm just in denial right now.
2011-12-20T02:17:53  <bhasker> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=13197 mine is dropping by the minute!
2011-12-20T02:17:55  <bhasker> :(
2011-12-20T02:17:56  <bmh> LouisMartin: But you learned a lot, right?
2011-12-20T02:18:02  <bhasker> will probably sit at 1000 or so
2011-12-20T02:18:54  <LouisMartin> BenJackson: Yea. I've being coding since 20 years or so. You would believe I wouldn't do such a judgement error right?   Wrong.
2011-12-20T02:20:03  <LouisMartin> That said, it was worth it.. I think ..  I think I gain more in the "bug exchange" that I lost, so...
2011-12-20T02:20:15  <Scryer> Give it a few more years. I've been coding since 1965, and decided to let it rest with 30 hours to go despite having some quick and easy ideas that "couldn't possibly go wrong."
2011-12-20T02:20:50  <LouisMartin> Scryer: Thanks for the hope. :)
2011-12-20T02:20:57  <BenJackson> even though I didn't make any fatal mistakes (that I know of!) I still lost a lot of rigor in the final week
2011-12-20T02:21:04  <BenJackson> not tuning as carefully
2011-12-20T02:21:13  <BenJackson> or checking cases I didn't think I broke
2011-12-20T02:21:16  <thestinger> BenJackson: I did basically nothing in the past 2 weeks
2011-12-20T02:21:18  <BenJackson> burnout basically
2011-12-20T02:21:19  <thestinger> I just merged some stuff
2011-12-20T02:21:23  <thestinger> I coded maybe 15 lines
2011-12-20T02:21:30  <thestinger> all in the last few hours
2011-12-20T02:21:47  <LouisMartin> I slept only 2 x 3 hours in the last 72 hours, so I think my judgement was pretty off at that time.
2011-12-20T02:22:06  <thestinger> well, I coded a bunch of other stuff but I didn't use any of it
2011-12-20T02:22:22  <thestinger> new defense, new combat, territory control stuff :P
2011-12-20T02:22:28  <thestinger> it all sucked
2011-12-20T02:22:48  <Scryer> It helped a lot that I had house guests and grandchildren running all over the house, so I *knew* I was brain-impaired.

2011-12-20T02:24:55  <Scryer> ChrisH - I don't see how a starter bot can work well as a quicksort-like pivot.

2011-12-20T02:26:10  <Scryer> But its record should make it pretty clear.
2011-12-20T02:26:21  <ChrisH_> Scryer: and if 40% of bots are starter bots, maybe more, the odds are high that some get shoved into that job
2011-12-20T02:26:23  <BenJackson> Scryer: there are maps where starter bots can capture hills
2011-12-20T02:26:32  <BenJackson> some with rotational symmetry that means only some do/can
2011-12-20T02:26:37  <peerai> yeah, you can remove them by patterns on certain maps
2011-12-20T02:26:55  <ChrisH_> the system is going to try and sort all the starter bots too, so some pivots need to be down in the lower ranges as well
2011-12-20T02:27:07  <ChrisH_> that is until the cutoffs get turned on
2011-12-20T02:27:08  <Scryer> I pointed out one (of very many) on a forum thread that had a dozen games in a few minutes where none of the bots in the game was capturing anything.
2011-12-20T02:27:36  <peerai> I went from place 5000 to 1400 in my last game
2011-12-20T02:27:54  <ChrisH_> and that makes it even harder on the engine because all those bots's mu's will converge to the same value, but it's still trying to figure out which ones are better
2011-12-20T02:28:31  <ChrisH_> and there are some bots that are worse than starters, so a starter pivot sorts those out as well
2011-12-20T02:28:54  <f4hy> I should ignore the "next game should be withing 17 hours
2011-12-20T02:28:59  <ChrisH_> the engine isn't just trying to find the top bots, it wants to find a total ordering
2011-12-20T02:29:41  <Scryer> All the more reason to have an efficient way to sort out the starter bots, since they'll end up with the same value in a total ordering and poison the process while they're doing it.

2011-12-20T02:30:11  <Scryer> The majority of the starter bot games are all co-equal #1.
2011-12-20T02:30:47  <ChrisH_> Here's one more point though, a starter bot pivot is a good measuring stick for deciding if a bot is better than starters or not.
2011-12-20T02:30:52  <peerai> some starter bots get eliminated in a game earler as others. Yester I saw after 3 games a all starterbot game with all players ranked around 1k
2011-12-20T02:30:52  <LouisMartin> we should have an IRC REPL-bot so we could have coding fun together

2011-12-20T03:12:33  <codetiger> my number of games is mostly lower than other bots
2011-12-20T03:12:47  <codetiger> but I have high sigma compared to them
2011-12-20T03:12:57  <ChrisH_> i don't think so, there are a lot of bots with only 4 or 5 games
2011-12-20T03:13:01  <ChrisH_> what's your mu?
2011-12-20T03:13:23  <codetiger> 80

2011-12-20T03:16:51  <ChrisH_> codetiger: watching your bot it looks pretty good to me, it seems very efficient
2011-12-20T03:17:10  <codetiger> ChrisH_: Thanks. :) Informative post... Thanks
2011-12-20T03:17:28  <codetiger> I am wondering if it will reach top 100
2011-12-20T03:17:35  <codetiger> which it never did before

2011-12-20T03:19:26  <Ender_> Chrish : Which would also mean that a decent bot which is also a pivot will get a better chance over others (since it will play more games), if the final contest actually stops in 2 days time. If the contest time is longer and if every body gets at least arnd 100 games, that that wouldn't be an issue at all I think.
2011-12-20T03:19:38  <ChrisH_> codetiger: hard to guess ranks now, especially with everyone making improvements towrads the end
2011-12-20T03:20:17  <ChrisH_> Ender_: I agree, for it to be fair the non-pivots need to get their game count caught up at some point
2011-12-20T03:20:53  <ChrisH_> put it would be better if that is done against other bots similar to them rather than random bots, so hopefully this early phase saves us wasted gams down the road
2011-12-20T03:21:00  <ChrisH_> put = but
2011-12-20T03:21:35  <Ender_> Chirsh : may be the organizers can change pivot values once in every 10-12 hours like. Let the bots which have played least number of games (like codetiger) to be a pivot for few hours :-)
2011-12-20T03:21:53  <ChrisH_> hey, i've only got 4 games.  ;)
2011-12-20T03:22:22  <Ender_> Chrish : ah, then you too! may you and codetiger both be pivots soon!
2011-12-20T03:22:36  <ChrisH_> well, I know they have a limitter in the scheduler to try and equalize the games for bots over a 24 hour window, so hopefully that starts kicking in and levels it out

2011-12-20T03:23:04  <Varan> or mu
2011-12-20T03:23:14  <ChrisH_> i'd want to sort by mu
2011-12-20T03:23:44  <Varan> And also global sort ...not just one page
2011-12-20T03:23:52  <ChrisH_> yeah
2011-12-20T03:23:58  <Varan> but maybe thats a bit hard of the server :P
2011-12-20T03:24:13  <Ender_> in the earlier phases I have seen mu is most of time about 4.3 points more than a bot's actual rating. (there must be a good explanation in trueskill algo)
2011-12-20T03:25:00  <Ender_> so for all bots which have played at least about 60 games, their MU can be used pretty decently to predict their actual ratings
2011-12-20T03:25:35  <Varan> Yes in deed
2011-12-20T03:25:38  <Varan> indeed*
2011-12-20T03:26:42  <matthewd> Ender_: Well, skill = mu - sigma*3

2011-12-20T03:30:55  <matthewd> Yeah... where sigma will be a function of the number of games played, but also the sigma of the opponents (I think)
2011-12-20T03:32:36  <ChrisH_> matthewd: sigma is also influenced by how consistently you bot scores. if it does well in many games but finishes last often as well then sigma will never go as low as a bot that consistently ranks in line with it's mu score

2011-12-20T04:40:12  <BenJackson> so usually it accelerated any loss because when the peripheral ants were picked off suddenly the defenders were released to gather again and boom

2011-12-20T04:48:40  <Ender_> sir_macelon : not so good. I couldn't finish my latest bot on time (due to a bug), so had to submit a older version.
2011-12-20T04:48:41  <sir_macelon> Ender_: well, i was out for last month, busy in rl
2011-12-20T04:48:45  <BenJackson> they just prefer to defend as far from home as possible
2011-12-20T04:48:50  <BenJackson> so they always push ants away from my hills
2011-12-20T04:50:11  <Minthos> yes, that't pretty much what I do too, and I have a special rule that if I have x number of ants, the hill should always be visible
2011-12-20T04:50:12  <sir_macelon> Ender_: that's a pity
2011-12-20T04:50:26  <Ender_> sir_macelon : hope u manged to improve ur bot and submit a better version. BTW, ur older version  was actually improving in skill in last few days b4 submission closed. I guess it was better playing against stronger opponents than against weaker ones.
2011-12-20T04:50:52  <sir_macelon> Ender_: i managed to fix some bugs over the weekend and also a couple of hours before the deadline
2011-12-20T04:51:36  <sir_macelon> Ender_: it was a crappy experiment, totally screwed exploration, cause i tried to adjust more to mazes

2011-12-20T05:04:55  <Ender_> BenJackson : I too followed that strategy early on and delaying doing the combat code. It was a mistake, combat code was actually more fun (at least easier to test) to do and it require more time. how is you hill finding algorithm (SYMMETRY BREAKER) did u put that code in the final bot ?

2011-12-20T05:22:29  <Ender_> sir_macelon: I remember your prev version had one game against mine. probably the only game our bots have met in 1-1. this is when u had those issues in explore.
2011-12-20T05:22:33  <BenJackson> seems like straight up a-b pruned min-max with a good heuristic and optimizations is going to win
2011-12-20T05:25:32  <onion42> Benjackson: mine bot uses a straight up a-b pruned minimax with a terrible heuristic :(
2011-12-20T05:25:48  <Fluxid> BenJackson: wasn't it the case in tron?

2011-12-20T05:26:03  <onion42> so you are :)
2011-12-20T05:26:29  <onion42> that game looks solvable
2011-12-20T05:27:55  <Fluxid> well, next game i played in scholl is more similar to go
2011-12-20T05:28:13  <onion42> go might be quite good
2011-12-20T05:28:17  <onion42> although very hard
2011-12-20T05:28:41  <onion42> lots of moves to consider
2011-12-20T05:28:57  <Fluxid> it is much simpler than go but still game tree would be huge
2011-12-20T05:29:15  <onion42> well if the game tree is big enough, then it should be ok :)

2011-12-20T06:29:59  <Zaphus> Dang, I've played one game in the last 16 hours... and I lost it :-(   I really should have tested my bots in 1-on-1 maps but I thought the contest would be about the more populated maps, never assume!
2011-12-20T06:32:18  <Fluxid> wwwwww i want a game
2011-12-20T06:35:01  <Zaphus> Fluxid: how many have you had ?
2011-12-20T06:35:14  <Fluxid> 5
2011-12-20T06:35:45  <Zaphus> 5 with a loss in the 5th, same as me :-)
2011-12-20T06:35:47  <UncleVasya> I had 5 too.
2011-12-20T06:36:15  <UncleVasya> How many bots will get game before you guys?
2011-12-20T06:36:44  <Fluxid> Zaphus: that game made me sad
2011-12-20T06:36:46  <Zaphus> 3757

2011-12-20T06:37:09  <Fluxid> 225 minutes
2011-12-20T06:37:31  <UncleVasya> 600 :)
2011-12-20T06:37:33  <Zaphus> contest is meant to end in ~50 hours... I've had one game in the last 16hrs so that doesnt bode well for me recovering before the cutoffs are turned on
2011-12-20T06:38:05  <pairofdice> ...but you're rank 690
2011-12-20T06:38:35  <Fluxid> Zaphus: what, 50 hours?
2011-12-20T06:38:50  <Fluxid> where did you get that information from
2011-12-20T06:39:21  <Zaphus> Fluxid:  oh, add maybe 4-5 more, got timezones confused.   Front page of site says Dec 22nd, 6pm I think.   No announcement in the forums though
2011-12-20T06:39:38  <Zaphus> "Finals will end Thursday December 22nd at 7:00PM EST."
2011-12-20T06:39:54  <Zaphus> they should turn that countdown clock back on!
2011-12-20T06:40:08  <Fluxid> BenJackson: oh, you've got a laser cutter!

2011-12-20T06:51:58  <flowenol> freaking timeouts
2011-12-20T06:52:51  <peerai> I found that my timeouts were caused by writing debug info to disk....
2011-12-20T06:53:25  <flowenol> well im not :D
2011-12-20T06:53:44  <flowenol> its kinda annoying
2011-12-20T06:53:56  <flowenol> i cant reproduce it
2011-12-20T06:53:57  <flowenol> at all
2011-12-20T06:54:11  <flux_w42> I had a weird timeout to. Here on my pc it never timed out, not even with extreme map size. Old PC
2011-12-20T06:54:36  <flux_w42> During the finals already 1/5 of my games timed out :-(
2011-12-20T06:55:08  <flowenol> the version on the competition
2011-12-20T06:55:09  <flux_w42> I tested even with turntime=400 and it worked like a charm
2011-12-20T06:55:21  <flowenol> only had one timeout before the competition
2011-12-20T06:55:27  <flowenol> now it already has 3
2011-12-20T06:55:39  <flowenol> every loop that can cause it
2011-12-20T06:55:43  <flowenol> has a safeguard
2011-12-20T06:55:46  <flowenol> and still
2011-12-20T06:55:58  <flowenol> i had that problem locally when running 8 bots
2011-12-20T06:56:10  <flowenol> they started taking each other cpu
2011-12-20T06:56:20  <pairofdice> Stupid mistakes on ai class final, argh
2011-12-20T06:56:37  <bearoff_w> now the 50 hours to end sounds like joke. And will be till bots will have equal or similar games played at least
2011-12-20T06:57:20  <praveen> 50 hours will make sense only with cut-off starting now
2011-12-20T06:57:26  <flowenol> all i want is to get my rank back
2011-12-20T06:57:32  <flowenol> and i will be happy
2011-12-20T06:57:45  <flowenol> but the timeouts are not helping at all
2011-12-20T06:58:25  <flux_w42> it would only be fair if they wait till bots will have equal or similar games played at least
2011-12-20T06:58:37  <flowenol> and sigma
2011-12-20T06:58:56  <flowenol> ending on the 22nd seems so short
2011-12-20T06:59:18  <praveen> the player who gets picked is getting nearly 6 games and end up in a total 11+ games. after everybody get their 11+ cutoff should start. atleast >4000
2011-12-20T07:00:02  <flowenol> is there going to be a cutoff of low rank bots?
2011-12-20T07:00:10  <praveen> yes there will be
2011-12-20T07:00:22  <flowenol> when and what is the rule
2011-12-20T07:00:27  <praveen> low will be >5000 around to begin with
2011-12-20T07:00:39  <praveen> its not decided yet but its there
2011-12-20T07:00:46  <flowenol> dont you mean less than?
2011-12-20T07:01:02  <flux_w42> >5000 in ranking will be cut off
2011-12-20T07:01:08  <praveen> >5000 will not play any more games
2011-12-20T07:01:37  <bearoff_w> it will much better if organizers do not make secrets of how they plan to do cutoffs
2011-12-20T07:01:46  <flowenol> ah
2011-12-20T07:01:47  <flowenol> nvm

2011-12-20T07:28:42  <Fluxid> ;_;
2011-12-20T07:29:42  <Zaphus> 243 minutes for me
2011-12-20T07:30:27  <Zaphus> my rank after 5 games is higher than Xathis' was after 5 - that should count for something :-)
2011-12-20T07:30:51  <UncleVasya> 'watch out' means 'run away from top 100  as fast as you can - xathis is there!'
2011-12-20T07:30:59  <Zaphus> except that I can't read... and he was higher than me :-)
2011-12-20T07:31:20  <Varan> Rank doesn't say much at I think
2011-12-20T07:31:58  <janzert> Rank is only meaningful within a few thousand at the moment ;)
2011-12-20T07:32:11  <Varan> :P
2011-12-20T07:32:29  <Zaphus> seems wrong that the initial games ran about 1 every 2 hours or so (for each player) and now the matchmaking is turned on it's one every 10-12 hours for most people
2011-12-20T07:32:40  <Varan> So all of the first 2000 should consider to have the same rank at the moment :P
2011-12-20T07:32:51  <Varan> considered
2011-12-20T07:33:09  <peerai> there are probably still stater bots in the top 2k
2011-12-20T07:34:34  <Varan> You could make a cool picture of all the contestants sigma in one axis and mu in the other :P

2011-12-20T07:59:15  <ant_randomnumber> yeah... which languages can you use?
2011-12-20T07:59:34  <ant_randomnumber> i mean, i'd prefer to program in c++
2011-12-20T07:59:51  <Fluxid> and it looks to be mostly for MIT studenst, or eventually groups of students from other universities...
2011-12-20T08:00:00  <Fluxid> "We might allow non-MIT teams to compete in the January tournament this year. We will announce something soon."
2011-12-20T08:00:49  <ant_randomnumber> yeah, but they're mentioning an open tournament?

2011-12-20T08:03:42  <katebus> should be fun -> http://www.marioai.org/
2011-12-20T08:04:27  <ant_randomnumber> yup, thanks
2011-12-20T08:05:32  <sir_macelon> we have a new leader
2011-12-20T08:05:42  <katebus> next ai challenge? previously it was twice a year... looking at planet wars, then tron, and now ants
2011-12-20T08:06:16  <TL_> Fluxid: yes, there is not much info yet. there will be an open tournament in March based on the website.
2011-12-20T08:07:14  <sir_macelon> Next game should be within 4 minutes...

2011-12-20T08:08:56  <ant_randomnumber> @katebus: yeah, but 2010 challenges were held in fall and winter... and, since ants are a "fall" challenge... but i guess we can't expect the next challenge to be in winter already? :(

2011-12-20T08:26:43  <Varan> No I didn't :P

2011-12-20T08:27:08  <Fluxid> lol?
2011-12-20T08:27:10  <Varan> Ow then you did something bad in the code :P
2011-12-20T08:27:23  <janzert> I have a feeling hitting the above url is quite an expensive query at this point
2011-12-20T08:27:26  <Fluxid> trying to get json derailed whole server?
2011-12-20T08:27:33  <Fluxid> ouch
2011-12-20T08:27:44  <Varan> Only thing i did was call http://aichallenge.org/rankings_json.php .. which was a mistake becuase it should be ... http://aichallenge.org/ranking_json.php

2011-12-20T08:29:13  <Varan> But the url i put there should not work ... it had an typo
2011-12-20T08:29:15  <xyxan> what happened to website?
2011-12-20T08:29:24  <Fluxid> xyxan: see above
2011-12-20T08:29:53  <Varan> janzert, https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/website/ranking_json.php ... it seems to have pages ...
2011-12-20T08:29:55  <xyxan> lol whos json?
2011-12-20T08:30:06  <Varan> so why would it ask for the whole db
2011-12-20T08:30:16  <janzert> it does if you ask for a page
2011-12-20T08:30:36  <Varan> yeah and else it gives 0 right?
2011-12-20T08:30:40  <janzert> e.g. http://aichallenge.org/ranking_json.php?page=1
2011-12-20T08:30:46  <janzert> 0 means everything
2011-12-20T08:30:49  <Varan> ow
2011-12-20T08:30:51  <Varan> auw...
2011-12-20T08:30:58  <janzert> at least it looks like to me

2011-12-20T08:37:08  <Varan> in any case
2011-12-20T08:37:10  <janzert> nope, I already tried it ;)

2011-12-20T08:37:17  <janzert> you get a really big page though
2011-12-20T08:37:23  <Fluxid> i didn't try actually :)

2011-12-20T08:45:11  <janzert> Surya_: because most of the time most players will not be coming from ahead of you, it was doing a more complex calculation up until a few hours ago but it also had an error. This basically as accurate and much easier to calculate.
2011-12-20T08:45:14  <sir_macelon> Fluxid: I failed to optimize my code for mazes and they are very tricky anyway
2011-12-20T08:46:54  <mcstar> sir_macelon: you were the first one with real battle code
2011-12-20T08:47:03  <mcstar> how much have you changed it since?
2011-12-20T08:47:07  <Surya_> janzert : I got the part where players are not coming from ahead of us, but I don't get if the problem is now solved, and if the time displayed is legit?

2011-12-20T08:48:25  <janzert> Surya_: basically yes, it's a bit conservative when lots of players are ahead of you and doesn't account for game rate variations so may or may not be completely accurate but it's a fairly good estimate
2011-12-20T08:49:07  <Surya_> janzert : Thanks for your answer & your attention :)

2011-12-20T08:51:03  <sir_macelon> mcstar: i've only find out one bug on sunday with risk evaluation for 3+ enemy ant groups and adjusted it slightly to be more aggressive

2011-12-20T09:22:24  <tmseiler> same, I think they posted something about missing games
2011-12-20T09:22:49  <GreenTea> or this cutoff in action
2011-12-20T09:23:20  <GreenTea> a have a rank 518 to low to fight with top bots XD

2011-12-20T09:24:49  <mcstar> (i only heard)
2011-12-20T09:24:53  <tmseiler> is that a rolling thing? or a one-time thing?

2011-12-20T09:46:12  <tmseiler> I set an alarm clock
2011-12-20T09:46:18  <mcstar> how?
2011-12-20T09:46:21  <tmseiler> or did, when the times were more reliable
2011-12-20T09:46:25  <mcstar> ah
2011-12-20T09:46:41  <mcstar> i was thinking of greping the profile page
2011-12-20T09:47:11  <UncleVasya> Is site down again?
2011-12-20T09:47:21  <mcstar> nah
2011-12-20T09:47:22  <UncleVasya> nvm
2011-12-20T09:47:34  <tmseiler> it'd be easy to screen-scape, but not very polite to the organizers
2011-12-20T09:47:55  <mcstar> whats that? "screen-scape"?
2011-12-20T09:48:07  <tmseiler> loading the page with a script/program and parsing the data out
2011-12-20T09:48:19  <rwest> I have a script that sends an email
2011-12-20T09:48:21  <mcstar> why is it bad?
2011-12-20T09:48:32  <mcstar> i mean it doesnt load images and such only text
2011-12-20T09:48:34  <peerai> json a easier
2011-12-20T09:48:35  <tmseiler> their servers are under enough load from actual humans mashing reload
2011-12-20T09:48:37  <mcstar> so it wouldbe minimal bandwidth
2011-12-20T09:48:56  <rwest> tmseiler: I do a 5 min poll, which is slower than I would refresh at
2011-12-20T09:48:56  <mcstar> but a script would check in every minute or so
2011-12-20T09:49:19  <mcstar> i think im gonna do it
2011-12-20T09:49:40  <mcstar> how can i log in with wget?
2011-12-20T09:49:42  <mcstar> :D
2011-12-20T09:49:56  <tmseiler> yeah, I guess I'm just saying that personal scripts are probably fine, but a site to hammer it and keep stats wouldn't be very nice

2011-12-20T10:00:33  <rwest> it must be in every page
2011-12-20T10:00:39  <rwest> logged or not

2011-12-20T10:03:04  <a1k0n> you can ask for it via the Range: header

2011-12-20T10:08:34  <tob__k> I wondered, what was the reasons all ranks -- even those for past versions of the bots -- were reset? I found this information very useful and a huge improvement compared to the last contest. Is this information still available somewhere?
2011-12-20T10:08:34  <mcstar> i somehow assumed its there
2011-12-20T10:08:45  <mcstar> but in fact i only saw that with opera source viewver

2011-12-20T10:23:52  <Elderwolf> Fluxid: You know if there is any interest in people continuing to use servers like yours to continue to pit their bots against each other after the contest?
2011-12-20T10:24:13  <tmseiler> I know I'm definitely going to keep playing with my friends
2011-12-20T10:24:27  <tmseiler> this would be a great tool at computer camp, too
2011-12-20T10:24:32  <Fluxid> i'm pretty surre that every second i hit F5, the minute counter get's lower by 1/60
2011-12-20T10:24:38  <Fluxid> so hitting F5 helps
2011-12-20T10:24:47  <mcstar> lol

2011-12-20T10:26:54  <Elderwolf> Has anyone used a subset of ants to guard their hills?  I haven't seen any yet.
2011-12-20T10:27:00  <Fluxid> you know what would be awesome? a bot which during submission phase would be like 1000 places behind
2011-12-20T10:27:20  <Fluxid> but during finals it would suddenly kick xathis's and other top bots ass
2011-12-20T10:27:59  <Fluxid> Elderwolf: i dispatch 7 ants to wander around hill
2011-12-20T10:28:16  <Elderwolf> Fluxid: well, some people's could if there was a sudden influx of maze maps.  Depending on your path finding algorithm some just do better there
2011-12-20T10:28:18  <pairofdice> sleeper bot
2011-12-20T10:28:39  <Fluxid> it's name would be procrastinationbot
2011-12-20T10:28:45  <Elderwolf> Fluxid: or someone that always timed out, but could reliably kill 65% of hills before time out
2011-12-20T10:29:01  <Fluxid> its
2011-12-20T10:29:12  <Fluxid> 22 minutes

2011-12-20T10:32:31  <Surya_> I realize now that my bot is fucked up on close multi hills >< It just kamikazes on every enemy ants so they don't see my hill ><
2011-12-20T10:32:33  <janzert> a good example right now is http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=896
2011-12-20T10:32:41  <pairofdice> So if there's no modification at all you can spot it easily
2011-12-20T10:33:05  <janzert> rated <2000 at close of submissions >7300 currently
2011-12-20T10:33:06  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=277755&user=53 lol, turn 244 around 43,147
2011-12-20T10:33:30  <janzert> and is clearly better than a starter bot
2011-12-20T10:33:37  <UncleVasya> I think the best idea was to deny going to the final round bots that are worse then GreedyBot   AND was deactivated (or deactivated for a long period of time).
2011-12-20T10:34:06  <flowenol> janzert: is the cutoff rank decided?
2011-12-20T10:34:10  <flowenol> or not yet
2011-12-20T10:34:25  <janzert> what does that question mean? ;)
2011-12-20T10:34:31  <janzert> the cutoff rank is dynamic
2011-12-20T10:34:40  <flowenol> ah ok
2011-12-20T10:34:46  <bearoff_w> janzert, may be you can spent some time to deactivate starter bots manually?
2011-12-20T10:34:49  <janzert> it will first move up past the starter bots, then slowly go up from there
2011-12-20T10:35:12  <janzert> bearoff_w: no, no bots will be deactivated
2011-12-20T10:35:21  <Fluxid> hm, i wonder how could we adapt conway's game of life into aichallenge game
2011-12-20T10:35:22  <janzert> just get cutoff eventually
2011-12-20T10:35:38  <Fluxid> like, bots building gliders and other structures just to beat the enemy "somehow"

2011-12-20T10:40:53  <Fluxid> janzert: yeah, that would be hard. but i wonder, have some areas on the maps designated to build stuff, and after the stuff leaves this area you cannot do anything more with it.. hmmhmmm
2011-12-20T10:41:15  <janzert> Fluxid: yep, that's the idea
2011-12-20T10:41:26  <mcstar> matthewd: ok, its certainly possible, what is the correct way?
2011-12-20T10:41:32  <matthewd> mcstar: But support for ranges is purely optional, and normally only supported against static on-disk files (or things very similar), where the server can actually benefit by not sending it all
2011-12-20T10:41:57  <matthewd> mcstar: When requesting a PHP script, the server has to run the entire script anyway, so it won't bother with the range
2011-12-20T10:42:05  <mcstar> ok i get it
2011-12-20T10:42:12  <mcstar> but what is the correct sytax?
2011-12-20T10:42:14  <mcstar> n
2011-12-20T10:42:16  <Fluxid> or being able only to build gliders and anython else
2011-12-20T10:42:53  <janzert> hmm, limiting the types of structures built instead of the area to build seems less interesting
2011-12-20T10:43:02  <matthewd> mcstar: wget --header='Range: bytes=0-10' ...
2011-12-20T10:43:20  <janzert> also besides limiting area there was a limit on number of cells changed per turn

2011-12-20T10:44:11  <tmseiler> what about a game with something a little more persistent than moving units around?
2011-12-20T10:44:14  <tmseiler> like a base to construct
2011-12-20T10:44:26  <pairofdice> They weren't paid to cry because nobody gets pain in NK
2011-12-20T10:44:34  <pairofdice> paid*
2011-12-20T10:44:50  <Fluxid> yeah, but gliders go diagonally, map would be wide enough not for gliders not to be able to reach enemys area. so you need to send gliders in such way, that colliding them with themselves/enemy gliders would cause such reaction that would cause enemy to loose (and also sending gliders so it would cancel the reaction going close to own area)
2011-12-20T10:45:22  <Fluxid> and have 3x3 area which hitting it would cause player to loose, so reaction would need to reach it

2011-12-20T10:49:05  <ChrisH_> besh: what is the problem you read about?
2011-12-20T10:49:11  <Fluxid> 553rd
2011-12-20T10:49:22  <Fluxid> Next game should be within 688 minutes.
2011-12-20T10:49:26  <Fluxid> OH COME ON
2011-12-20T10:49:28  <janzert> although it does have a known race condition, that is still present, that can cause similar matches to be played close together
2011-12-20T10:49:29  <besh> that some bots are getting a lot more games than ohters.
2011-12-20T10:49:38  <Fluxid> at this pace it'd take few days to get 10 games
2011-12-20T10:49:51  <pairofdice> Many bots at 12 games, many other bots at 5 games
2011-12-20T10:49:51  <rwest> Fluxid: I got 7 games last night
2011-12-20T10:49:52  <besh> My engine is stuck at 5 i think
2011-12-20T10:49:58  <rwest> 5 within 20 minutes
2011-12-20T10:50:01  <ChrisH_> besh: read my response in this thread: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=2183&p=13582#p13582

2011-12-20T10:51:42  <Fluxid> ChrisH_: i'm still not convinced, but okay
2011-12-20T10:52:04  <Anilm3> great battle Fluxid
2011-12-20T10:52:13  <Fluxid> boring ;)
2011-12-20T10:52:24  <pairofdice> I guess I should be happy my bot is one of the pivots
2011-12-20T10:52:24  <Fluxid> but feels good man
2011-12-20T10:52:36  <pairofdice> eat dust non-pivots!
2011-12-20T10:53:03  <sir_macelon> 26th place and crusing to the top!
2011-12-20T10:53:05  <besh> ChrisH_: Ok that makes sense. So it is trying to stabilize rating of some bots so that they would be used as landmarks.
2011-12-20T10:53:17  <ChrisH_> besh: yes
2011-12-20T10:53:47  <ChrisH_> but the part I don't know is how it will then compensate for the other bots later
2011-12-20T10:53:51  <mcstar> it still isnt conscious
2011-12-20T10:53:56  <pairofdice> Atleast my rank is roughly what it was before finals
2011-12-20T10:54:04  <Fluxid> sir_macelon: gz!
2011-12-20T10:54:26  <ChrisH_> and I'm just reporting behavior, i didn't write the code nor do I know what the plans are about cutoffs or anything
2011-12-20T10:54:28  <besh> chrish_: yes some of them would have to play more games than others at any time
2011-12-20T10:55:05  <sir_macelon> Fluxid: Thanks although I've lost some games already...
2011-12-20T10:55:17  <ChrisH_> but so many people were confused about the game counts it seemed important to help people understand
2011-12-20T10:56:14  <Fluxid> old top bots are already pretty close to top
2011-12-20T10:56:18  <ChrisH_> another thing to be wary of is that many of the bots currently in the top 100 are there mostly because their sigmas are low, not because they are dominating all their matches
2011-12-20T10:56:22  <Fluxid> and i'm loooow

2011-12-20T11:00:05  <roflmao> but
2011-12-20T11:00:09  <roflmao> I'm sure it will stabilize

2011-12-20T12:20:34  <a1k0n> Accoun: i don't group them.  all ants are considered together.
2011-12-20T12:20:47  <Ashoka> a1k0n: you have made a big improvement in comparatively shorter time. :-)
2011-12-20T12:20:51  <a1k0n> i define a lattice, so that each ant has a neighbor to the north and to the west
2011-12-20T12:21:06  <a1k0n> and the optimal move for that ant depends on what its neighbors are doing
2011-12-20T12:21:16  <mcstar> a1k0n: so its sub-optimal
2011-12-20T12:21:25  <mcstar> i mean you create an ordering
2011-12-20T12:21:28  <a1k0n> (which means it's better at combat in some directions than others)
2011-12-20T12:21:35  <a1k0n> it's nowhere close to optimal

2011-12-20T13:37:04  <conor_f> I managed to log in and that using curl, now all I have to do is work around ajax :/
2011-12-20T13:37:28  <rwest> flowenol has the one that texts him, but it uses a gateway in portugal
2011-12-20T13:37:46  <janzert> conor_f: I don't think we're using AJAX anywhere on the site
2011-12-20T13:37:54  <janzert> at least not that I can think of offhand

2011-12-20T13:39:36  <rwest> I know all US carriers have emails addresses for their phone numbers that convert to text
2011-12-20T13:39:44  <rwest> dunno about other countries
2011-12-20T13:39:52  <rwest> so I email my phone

2011-12-20T14:08:38  <Belerafon> is this a hatred? :)
2011-12-20T14:08:58  <Migi32> hey, I've got an idea for the next contest and would like some feedback before posting it on the forums: it's Haxball (http://haxball.com/), which is basically a simplified form of soccer. Each bot controls 11 circles (which move quite slow, but can kick the ball if they touch it) and the first bot to score 3 goals or something wins
2011-12-20T14:08:59  <mleise> who is winning?
2011-12-20T14:09:08  <Migi32> it's physcis based, with continuous instead of discrete states, which I think would be really cool for an AI contest.
2011-12-20T14:09:17  <Migi32> A big plus is also that the physics are really simple. There are only circles and straight walls.
2011-12-20T14:09:27  <Migi32> We could even make it real-time, but that's probably a step too far, because of latency issues etc (especially on TCP servers).
2011-12-20T14:09:30  <Surya> Is there any news about the cut of low ranks bots date? (starter packs)
2011-12-20T14:10:07  <avdg> meh, flash is broken in chrome (can't type in input boxes) :/
2011-12-20T14:10:19  <Migi32> avdg: not for me
2011-12-20T14:10:39  <mleise> but Migi32, that was your idea for this contest already ;)

2011-12-20T14:14:14  <Migi32> yeah, continuous things would be really interesting. There are 2 issues we'd need to think about though: rounding errors (for continuous space) and latency things (for continuous time)
2011-12-20T14:14:31  <conor_f> i like that idea :)

2011-12-20T14:15:35  <mcstar> like molecular dynamics
2011-12-20T14:15:39  <flowenol> besh well you are gonna need pyquery module
2011-12-20T14:15:40  <mcstar> you dont compute everything

2011-12-20T14:16:26  <Migi32> ah yeah, true. I have actually no idea what a "perfect" strategy for this game would be
2011-12-20T14:16:33  <flowenol> well all i did was emerge -av pyquery but then, my linux distro is gentoo

2011-12-20T14:20:17  <GreenTea> So, this game can be step by stepwise but continous during visualization
2011-12-20T14:20:21  <flowenol> GreenTea a nice idea

2011-12-20T14:20:29  <pairofdice> Just like queue comp
2011-12-20T14:20:49  <pairofdice> It just interpolates the missing bits (3 frames for each turn)

2011-12-20T14:22:01  <Migi32> GreenTea: yes, that's a possibility. Do we make the computation time equal to the simulated game time? There's technically no reason to, but it would allow you to follow games at normal speed as they're being played.
2011-12-20T14:22:06  <GreenTea> And I still want Risk like game)

2011-12-20T14:23:41  <rwest> GreenTea: however it would be kind of trivial to make a bot to train via genetic algorithms
2011-12-20T14:23:47  <Migi32> isn't risk essentially a bit like planetwars though? But with restricted paths, and randomness?
2011-12-20T14:23:56  <mcstar> hahah
2011-12-20T14:24:00  <Migi32> I really wouldn't want randomness though
2011-12-20T14:24:05  <mcstar> they played that game in the hostel
2011-12-20T14:24:11  <mcstar> i mean my friends, but i hated it
2011-12-20T14:24:16  <mcstar> its called Riziko
2011-12-20T14:24:25  <GreenTea> randomnes is not big issue

2011-12-20T14:28:53  <Migi32> also, do you guys know about Diplomacy? It's very similar to Risk, but it's focused on communication between players, and you can assist other people's attacks etc.
2011-12-20T14:28:55  <GreenTea> Migi32, in such a game I think the most important will be learning how other player moves during game, learn its weak plases and use them, it is not so easy)

2011-12-20T14:29:09  <Migi32> could be interesting to see how bots would play Diplomacy

2011-12-20T14:50:36  <tomb___> not funny?  joke? no?  i'll go back to lurking now.
2011-12-20T14:50:45  <amstan> i'm so tired of this..
2011-12-20T14:50:55  <pairofdice> The ranking is pretty perfect
2011-12-20T14:50:58  <mcstar> check this out: http://imgur.com/PQcIG upper right corner
2011-12-20T14:51:09  <amstan> everyone's just suggesting how we should add more rules: "how about you dismiss games that have timeouts near eachother"
2011-12-20T14:51:13  <tomb___> from what i read, it works pretty well
2011-12-20T14:51:16  <amstan> they don't realize how much work and testing that could cause
2011-12-20T14:51:39  <avdg> mcstar: nice ;-)
2011-12-20T14:51:54  <tomb___> but if everyone is complaining, the next challenge would be, ok, so you think you can better.
2011-12-20T14:52:08  <amstan> tomb___: no.. because everyone's complaining now
2011-12-20T14:52:10  <avdg> everybody will complain, its just a rule
2011-12-20T14:52:23  <amstan> and when it comes time to actually build the next engine there's going to be like one person doing it
2011-12-20T14:52:40  <tomb___> right.  i am not complaining.
2011-12-20T14:52:40  <mcstar> amstan: dont forget that many are thankful too
2011-12-20T14:52:59  <Wraithan> amstan: their pride is on the line, god forbid they do poorly because their bot sucked, more likely it is due to the rules and the engine sucking.

2011-12-20T14:53:20  <amstan> well, of course

2011-12-20T14:53:56  <jcdny> Part of the problem is timeouts are such a black box to people maybe just more visibility into turn times would help.

2011-12-20T14:55:16  <jcdny> And of course for some languages you don't necessarily have the fine control over the GC etc so it all seems unfair to someone who gets sort of random timeouts.

2011-12-20T14:56:39  <ChrisH_> I'm curious, if CPU time was used, is there a good way for a bot to know how much CPU time it used since the start of a turn?
2011-12-20T14:56:58  <Murashka> rdtsc
2011-12-20T14:57:04  <amstan> ChrisH_: there is, but then you get threads, so you need to count for all threads at once
2011-12-20T14:57:16  <amstan> ChrisH_: and is you do something like sleep(10000)
2011-12-20T14:57:22  <amstan> it's not counted as cpu time

2011-12-20T14:58:22  <ChrisH_> amstan: so that sounds like the answer is no
2011-12-20T14:58:29  <bretep> Does 'time.clock()' create a thread in python, or do I misunderstand?
2011-12-20T14:58:36  <amstan> ChrisH_: it's possible, and ideally that's what we need to do
2011-12-20T14:58:39  <BenJackson> Accoun: I think part of the problem now is that they're relying on the fairness of the linux scheduler for that
2011-12-20T14:58:40  <conor_f> just run it as a background program?
2011-12-20T14:58:43  <amstan> ChrisH_: but that's code, and nobody implemented it yet
2011-12-20T14:59:29  <ChrisH_> amstan: I understand that, but I'm thinking from the bot implementer's point of view how they could write code to reliably know when their CPU time alottment was about to expire and make sure their orders are sent in time.
2011-12-20T14:59:47  <amstan> i think it's fairly trivial if you only have 1 thread
2011-12-20T14:59:50  <ChrisH_> amstan: both pieces need to be doable for the whole system to work together
2011-12-20T14:59:50  <jcdny> you would also need to do it for windows as well as linux and for all the different languages.  huge pain in the ass.
2011-12-20T15:00:09  <ChrisH_> amstan: what if your language uses more than one thread behind your back
2011-12-20T15:00:16  <amstan> then no idea, lol
2011-12-20T15:00:20  <amstan> go by clock time
2011-12-20T15:00:23  <amstan> and you'll always be short
2011-12-20T15:00:23  <ChrisH_> amstan: so java is out
2011-12-20T15:00:31  <BenJackson> wow, the top 100 has really shaped up overnight
2011-12-20T15:00:47  <amstan> staying under the wall time will pretty much guarantee that you won't time out
2011-12-20T15:00:53  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: it's always possible to monitor all the threads
2011-12-20T15:01:04  <BenJackson> one possibility is that the engine provides a signal to the bot at some point
2011-12-20T15:01:14  <BenJackson> since signal handling will probably be more accessible to more languages
2011-12-20T15:01:18  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: i'm talking about from inside the bot, not from the engine's perspective
2011-12-20T15:01:25  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-20T15:01:36  <BenJackson> so the engine does the monitoring so it's 100% consistent
2011-12-20T15:01:44  <BenJackson> and then somehow tells the process
2011-12-20T15:01:45  <amstan> yeah, signals would be nice then
2011-12-20T15:01:50  <Murashka> server could send warning via events or via input stream

2011-12-20T15:02:27  <amstan> what if some people want it earlier or later?
2011-12-20T15:02:36  <BenJackson> could be at a fixed point or it could be requested by the client at start
2011-12-20T15:02:44  <ChrisH_> amstan: you would have to send a hearbeat signal every 10 ms or something
2011-12-20T15:02:51  <Murashka> every 100 ms for example
2011-12-20T15:03:26  <ChrisH_> of course the bots have to be ready to receive the signal on time for it to be reliable
2011-12-20T15:03:31  <BenJackson> even then some langauges probably won't have easy access to nonblocking IO or signals

2011-12-20T15:04:41  <conor_f> mcstar: just so you know, that notification came up with a load of HTML ;)
2011-12-20T15:04:47  <BenJackson> oh the other hand some of the timeouts people hate (like GC) are not simply timing errors, they're real things that are somewhat outside of the player's control
2011-12-20T15:05:37  <BenJackson> for that I think something like allocating "5 seconds for 10 turns but no more than 1s per turn" would help

2011-12-20T15:05:57  <amstan> honestly, for stuff like that i really think it's fair
2011-12-20T15:06:16  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: yes, and my only real merit was being far from teapot
2011-12-20T15:06:18  <BenJackson> but I'll take it
2011-12-20T15:06:24  <amstan> in the real world it's the same, if you can't choose a language that's fairly time deterministic, you'll have issues
2011-12-20T15:06:25  <Belerafon> If you create starter kit with threads, heartbeat and realtime, only 50-100 players want to play
2011-12-20T15:06:31  <ChrisH_> encourage people to create less garbage for the GC to cleanup . ;)
2011-12-20T15:06:32  <Murashka> Another way is to give portion of time for several turns. And let's bot decide what to do with it.
2011-12-20T15:06:41  <amstan> ChrisH_: that too
2011-12-20T15:06:59  <avdg> I ended up with using c++ anyway
2011-12-20T15:07:13  <Zaphus> morning all
2011-12-20T15:07:40  <BenJackson> Zaphus arrives and suddenly I look at my profile again to make sure my game mu applied
2011-12-20T15:07:41  <Murashka> and evening too
2011-12-20T15:07:56  <rwest> ChrisH_: that's another trade off, in java it's faster to create a new array than 0 out a previous one
2011-12-20T15:07:59  <ChrisH_> I learned from a great blog article that Go is much faster if you don't create a lot of garbage, and using that idea really made my bot faster in many parts
2011-12-20T15:08:02  <Belerafon> Zaphus: good midnight
2011-12-20T15:08:08  <rwest> so I leave more garbage, but get faster run time
2011-12-20T15:08:23  <ChrisH_> rwest: which means that knowing how your language performs is key
2011-12-20T15:08:31  <ChrisH_> rwest: I used Go, and it's just the opposite
2011-12-20T15:08:46  <rwest> ChrisH_: next time I will just use c/c++ and not deal with it
2011-12-20T15:09:05  <Zaphus> BenJackson: No danger of that for me, I'd need a game to have it applied.. one game in the last 12 hours, two in the last 26 hours :-(
2011-12-20T15:09:05  <ChrisH_> rwest: no, instead you'll have to deal with cleaning up garbage manually  ;)
2011-12-20T15:09:30  <rwest> ChrisH_: which is fine, but I will know when I can break out of routines

2011-12-20T15:42:59  <mcstar> but those names were top bots before
2011-12-20T15:43:22  <mcstar> but yeah, it could be interpreted backwards, which is probably the correct one
2011-12-20T15:43:28  <jcdny> his opponents capped each other on the same turn
2011-12-20T15:43:31  <Zaphus> mcstar: yes, definitely agree there... except mine seems to be missing, must be a bug in the SQL, couldnt be because I already lost 1 of my 6 games :-)
2011-12-20T15:43:40  <bretep> lol, just took a hill with 170 ants in it
2011-12-20T15:43:48  <GreenTea> jcdny, hehe)
2011-12-20T15:43:50  <jcdny> capped each other, not same turn...
2011-12-20T15:44:58  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: so what do you think about changing the sort order for the seed queue?
2011-12-20T15:45:00  <bearoff> mcstar, what was you rank before submission end?
2011-12-20T15:45:17  <mcstar> bearoff: ~110
2011-12-20T15:45:36  <bearoff> thanks
2011-12-20T15:45:40  <mcstar> my bot seems to give up hills too easily sometimes damn
2011-12-20T15:45:48  <mcstar> why?
2011-12-20T15:45:53  <bearoff> do you run last version on tcpants now?
2011-12-20T15:45:55  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: we need 2 of 3 votes for a change, and I'm the only one aroun
2011-12-20T15:45:56  <mcstar> trying to extrapolate?
2011-12-20T15:45:59  <mcstar> yes
2011-12-20T15:46:09  <bearoff> aha
2011-12-20T15:46:13  <bearoff> seems my bot should be not far from you
2011-12-20T15:46:24  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: ok, I sent the idea to janzert with a "later tell" earlier
2011-12-20T15:46:33  * avdg wonders if steve887 was fighting for the last position
2011-12-20T15:46:38  <mcstar> bearoff: i changed much since the last stable ranking happened

2011-12-20T15:47:57  <Zaphus> McLeopold: if you did that change, all the 6's would get a game real fast, then the 7's (which includes the 6's that just had a game), etc...   - right ?    with a smattering of other numbers chosen as opponents
2011-12-20T15:48:00  <bearoff> i ask to compare with you as i had never let newest bot's version to play many games last days
2011-12-20T15:48:02  <mcstar> my bot is going to be better on multi-hill maps i suppose
2011-12-20T15:48:13  <bearoff> don't know how strong it became after changes
2011-12-20T15:48:13  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: that's the idea

2011-12-20T15:48:22  <flowenol> damn last game was 6h ago
2011-12-20T15:48:48  <Zaphus> ChrisH_ seems fair to balance the game count, I assume it would still be OK for the ranking system because opponents are still chosen 'correctly'
2011-12-20T15:49:14  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: yes, and balancing game count has a big impact on the sigma scores, which makes the skills mean more
2011-12-20T15:49:27  <g0llum> http://ants-score.appspot.com/?uid=AgentSmith had quite a win against mine lately

2011-12-20T15:56:24  <Zaphus> stocha: Hi !    about to log off to go to work (8am Wed here) - hoping to see some more games from the top bots today
2011-12-20T15:56:24  <McLeopold> if everyone tied for 1st, it still counts as a win
2011-12-20T15:56:48  <McLeopold> I'm not going to curn the database looking for "true" wins :)
2011-12-20T15:56:54  <stocha> Zaphus: do you think you bot will do okay ?
2011-12-20T15:57:10  <Zaphus> McLeopold: when testing locally I tracked "number of bots you beat" - so that would be 0 in a tie, made for a good simple statistic
2011-12-20T15:57:17  <GreenTea> so many starter bots..
2011-12-20T15:57:21  <flowenol> McLeopold at this rate, dont you think the time limit is too short?
2011-12-20T15:57:30  <BenJackson> McLeopold: how about win and mu increase from win > 1
2011-12-20T15:57:37  <Zaphus> stocha: I should make top 100, but not much better than that - I didnt test on 2 player maps and they are now ~30% of the finals
2011-12-20T15:58:06  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: I didn't test on 2 player maps either.
2011-12-20T15:58:17  <stocha> Zaphus: there was no clue about final map distribution ?

2011-12-20T16:00:40  <GreenTea> just test 100 moves on several maps
2011-12-20T16:00:46  <flowenol> why not doing md5sum of their files and compare?
2011-12-20T16:00:51  <McLeopold> GreenTea: we will capture md5 hashes of uploads next time, or something
2011-12-20T16:00:52  <flowenol> it would remove a lot of them
2011-12-20T16:00:53  <GreenTea> are they same as in starter bots
2011-12-20T16:01:13  <g0llum> stocha, you could have grinned during the whole final, by uploading your old java bot. not knowing any hills, it would have made it to 160.
2011-12-20T16:01:18  <flowenol> McLeopold you could add some dummy output
2011-12-20T16:01:21  * avdg wonders if starter bot could create stabilized games
2011-12-20T16:01:22  <McLeopold> a behavior test might be more accurate
2011-12-20T16:01:22  <BenJackson> McLeopold: I was pointing out you can eliminate any bots with identical hashes
2011-12-20T16:01:26  <bretep> Maybe it was a good idea if they had a few starter bots running before the finals, and cut everyone off who ended after them.
2011-12-20T16:01:34  <BenJackson> because even a non-starter identical must be someone with two accounts...

2011-12-20T16:02:12  <Zaphus> BenJackson: No, you could have done the tutorial cut+paste, then you'd be identical but better than starter
2011-12-20T16:02:19  <stocha> g0llum: i doubt not knowing hills nor combat would enable first 100
2011-12-20T16:02:36  <thestinger> BenJackson: http://aichallenge.org/quickstart.php that page was the problem :P
2011-12-20T16:02:56  <thestinger> it recommends just uploading a starter bot and encourages you not to make any changes before your first upload
2011-12-20T16:03:02  <stocha> g0llum: i'm not even sure that one of my bot that did okay with some combat knowledge would have done well. I expect first 100th to be okay bots :)
2011-12-20T16:03:34  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: the other thing that has been mentioned before is that the starter kits haven't been the same over time and they don't have a good history for all of them, so they can't know all the hashes for all the versions of all the starter kits
2011-12-20T16:03:48  <stocha> g0llum: ah 160. well. why 160 ?
2011-12-20T16:03:50  <g0llum> stocha, but it was very good at spreading/food hunting/fighting, and would run 'accidentally' over any hill
2011-12-20T16:03:57  <Zaphus> The idea of a "beat this bar to compete in the finals" is growing on me - make a bot that you have to finish higher than to compete in the finals, and have it there from day 1.
2011-12-20T16:03:57  <mcstar> i would just ask everyone to resubmit, and telling them: pls no starter bots
2011-12-20T16:04:00  <Anti> The rankings are still all over the place
2011-12-20T16:04:33  <bretep> Or just something like a click-activate button
2011-12-20T16:04:35  <McLeopold> Zaphus: I would prefer a series of submission tests that you have to win
2011-12-20T16:04:37  <stocha> g0llum: i had like 50 bot in the first days of beta :p   wich one are you talking about :)
2011-12-20T16:04:38  <xar0l_> You dont need to remove ALL the starter bots, just MOST of them ... thus md5 sum for known ones should be sufficient. :)
2011-12-20T16:04:40  <ChrisH_> I kind of like the idea of someone having to activate their bot within the last week before finals in order to be part of the tournament
2011-12-20T16:04:47  <GreenTea> Or another idea
2011-12-20T16:04:57  <McLeopold> maybe even use that to divide contestants into levels
2011-12-20T16:05:00  <ChrisH_> bretep: you beat me to it
2011-12-20T16:05:04  <Manwe56_> About starter bots...They have a very poor logic, and so answer very quickly right? So their games should be run very quickly on the servers no? Or I am missing something?
2011-12-20T16:05:06  <GreenTea> before final user should uprove that he wants to participate in final..
2011-12-20T16:05:20  <Zaphus> McLeopold: Yes, that would do it.  have a second table for those who havent qualified yet, once they qualify they move to the other ladder and can compete in finals
2011-12-20T16:05:23  <stocha> What's wrong with simpy cutting the lesser 20% bots using their rankings ?
2011-12-20T16:05:31  <bretep> The game takes as long as the slowest bot, Manwe56_
2011-12-20T16:05:33  <GreenTea> many of people just upload bot and forgot about it in the same day/
2011-12-20T16:05:34  <McLeopold> Manwe56_: yeah, starterbots are fast

2011-12-20T16:05:59  <ChrisH_> stocha: just like they did for planet wars
2011-12-20T16:06:00  <Zaphus> stocha: right now, you might lose a non-starter bot who hasnt played many games and was just unlucky
2011-12-20T16:06:08  <stocha> ChrisH_: isn't that enough ?
2011-12-20T16:06:14  <Manwe56_> ok so if starter are paired in the same game, it could end very quickly
2011-12-20T16:06:17  <ChrisH_> stocha: it might be
2011-12-20T16:06:33  <ChrisH_> Zaphus: which is why I suggested the change to seed selection
2011-12-20T16:06:35  <Zaphus> stocha: Perhaps, but there's barely enough time to get enough games done
2011-12-20T16:06:37  <stocha> Zaphus: hardly. Can you pick up a good bot in the worst 3500 ?
2011-12-20T16:06:50  <flowenol> well 600minutes more of wait
2011-12-20T16:07:00  <stocha> Zaphus: the time limit is too short for sure. If they can't keep up the servers a bit more well ....
2011-12-20T16:07:10  <thestinger> stocha: ChrisH_ found a dozen good bots in the bottom half
2011-12-20T16:07:10  <Zaphus> stocha: no idea, the old rankings were cleared so we can't easily find someone who was top 1000 before and bottom 3500 now
2011-12-20T16:07:11  <flowenol> really at this rate the time for the competition is not enough
2011-12-20T16:07:17  <bretep> How quickly does the cutting go? I had a few timeouts at the start, got a somewhat weak ranking now.
2011-12-20T16:07:21  <mcstar> how about splitting by rank, you stabilize the upper part, after that you successively add the lower bots 1 by 1?
2011-12-20T16:07:24  <stocha> g0llum: what is your bot names by the way ?
2011-12-20T16:07:27  <Zaphus> anyway, must rush off to work - cya all later!
2011-12-20T16:07:29  <ChrisH_> I think if we could prioritize some of the bots with fewer games and get everyone up to to or 15 games minimum the cutoff point could be found fairly easily

2011-12-20T16:08:59  <stocha> Anti: i used to be during the early beta :p
2011-12-20T16:09:24  <Anti> Because of true skill not being order independent
2011-12-20T16:09:43  <McLeopold> Also, I think if we had an official tcp server, the 5 minute guide should talk about connecting to that, not uploading a bot right away
2011-12-20T16:10:14  <GreenTea> McLeopold, Another idea, before final user should approve that he wants to participate in final..  Because many of people just upload bot and forgot about it in the same day.
2011-12-20T16:10:21  <McLeopold> although, one of the goals is to have a really low bar, so anyone can participate
2011-12-20T16:10:36  <ChrisH_> GreenTea: I agree.
2011-12-20T16:10:37  <stocha> g0llum: interesting, how does it work ?

2011-12-20T16:10:44  <flowenol> GreenTea a nice idea
2011-12-20T16:10:44  <BenJackson> I think encouraging people to upload the starter kit is good adn bad
2011-12-20T16:10:50  <BenJackson> it probably got a few people to participate who might not have
2011-12-20T16:10:51  <mcstar> but you send an email notification to activate it if you want to play in the finals
2011-12-20T16:11:01  <BenJackson> but it probably got a ton of starter kits uploaded by people who would never do anything no matter what
2011-12-20T16:11:01  <GreenTea> McLeopold, why not?
2011-12-20T16:11:25  <avdg> well, all these starter bots created a good test case for the server farm ;-)
2011-12-20T16:11:28  <McLeopold> I don't want good bots to bow out.  I really think Accoun should have posted an entry.
2011-12-20T16:11:53  <McLeopold> avdg: yes, test failed
2011-12-20T16:11:54  <Anti> Anyone want to throw me a bone here? Am I wrong or don the people who have now had like 15 games been given an easier lot of games with "higher ranked bots"s?
2011-12-20T16:12:00  <stocha> Anti: i was very frustrated with the ranking system during the beta. But if Xathis indeed shows such a superioty as it deed, the winner will be clear enougth
2011-12-20T16:12:23  <McLeopold> Anti: maybe, if you got your games early, we didn't know who was good
2011-12-20T16:12:38  <stocha> GreenTea: yeah, that's a good point
2011-12-20T16:12:39  <Anti> Stocha I'm not just worried about 1st place
2011-12-20T16:12:53  <stocha> Anti: ah.
2011-12-20T16:13:04  <mcstar> i hope the first 1000 places will be stable though
2011-12-20T16:13:18  <Anti> Mcleopold shouldn't the bots have been playing with similar numbers of games?
2011-12-20T16:13:30  <Anti> Particularly until ranks are more stable
2011-12-20T16:13:41  <McLeopold> Anti: yes
2011-12-20T16:13:46  <McLeopold> we've had issues
2011-12-20T16:14:10  <stocha> Anti: multiplayer is impossible to solve as far as ranking goes.
2011-12-20T16:14:13  <McLeopold> right now there is a peak at 12-13 games and a smaller peak at 6 while we get everyone up to at least 7 games
2011-12-20T16:14:13  <ChrisH_> Anti: I think you point is valid
2011-12-20T16:14:16  <stocha> not to mention that maps can interfere with ranking too

2011-12-20T16:15:47  <mcstar> we just need a longer time
2011-12-20T16:15:54  <mcstar> as long as that is provided i dont worry
2011-12-20T16:16:03  <mcstar> McLeopold: what about financing?
2011-12-20T16:16:09  <stocha> ChrisH_: yet it seems that the ranking may pick up the winner
2011-12-20T16:16:19  <mcstar> will you be able to keep up the server as long as the ranks dont stabilize?
2011-12-20T16:16:35  <mcstar> or must you cut them off at some point?
2011-12-20T16:16:35  <flowenol> mcstar yea the time seems short
2011-12-20T16:17:27  <ChrisH_> stocha: yes, I think the winner is easier to pick, but getting the order "correct" lower in the rankings is harder
2011-12-20T16:17:43  <stocha> ChrisH_: i totally agree
2011-12-20T16:18:12  <bretep> Is there a idea till what point the rankings will be (somewhat) stabilized?
2011-12-20T16:18:15  <flowenol> damn I can even provide my server and desktop to play games if it makes it faster
2011-12-20T16:18:18  <stocha> ChrisH_: i was so frustrated with the ranking that i secretly hoped the winner will be contested :p
2011-12-20T16:18:37  <Anti> Well. I'm bummed that I don't get some easier games against supposedly top bots while others get to go in. And. Fill those spots with an advantage to theirrank
2011-12-20T16:18:54  <bretep> Last day it is discovered xathis uses threads or something :v
2011-12-20T16:19:07  <mcstar> he does

2011-12-20T16:19:15  <mcstar> but at most 1
2011-12-20T16:19:30  <bretep> At least :p

2011-12-20T16:19:49  <Anti> Mc.leopold, will the bots with lots of games at least not be chosen for more games?
2011-12-20T16:19:49  <stocha> Anti : you need at least 100 games to have a ranking.
2011-12-20T16:19:58  <flowenol> BenJackson dont forget java, it inherently uses some threads
2011-12-20T16:20:05  <thestinger> BenJackson: it's just 1 thread by default (I guess you know that though)

2011-12-20T16:20:20  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I have an explicit call at the start of my bot that sets the maximum running threads to 1
2011-12-20T16:20:33  <stocha> flowenol: you think one can somehow hack it's way through swing threads and use them for the contest ? :)
2011-12-20T16:20:33  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: but it's also the default compile mode on the server
2011-12-20T16:21:02  <flowenol> stocha i didnt say that, but when i attach a debugger i see a few, including a gc one
2011-12-20T16:21:11  <stocha> thestinger: are you sure there is only one thread active by default ?
2011-12-20T16:21:16  <thestinger> BenJackson: the Go support in gcc is basically broken and it uses 1 thread per goroutine though
2011-12-20T16:21:20  <flowenol> stocha though it would be interesting
2011-12-20T16:21:35  <stocha> flowenol: what are the other active thread ?
2011-12-20T16:21:39  <ChrisH_> thestinger: but the servers don't use gcc for go, they use the 6g compiler
2011-12-20T16:21:45  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yeah :)
2011-12-20T16:21:50  <flowenol> stocha i would have to check
2011-12-20T16:21:53  <thestinger> but gccgo isn't an option for that reason
2011-12-20T16:21:58  <ChrisH_> right
2011-12-20T16:22:05  <thestinger> 6g uses N:1 goroutines:threads by default
2011-12-20T16:22:12  <stocha> flowenol: it may be possible to go multihread. Yet it would hardly go unnoticed if you where top 10 :)
2011-12-20T16:22:14  <thestinger> but you can multiplex over more than 1
2011-12-20T16:22:28  <mcstar> thestinger: do you do anything else besides looking up language specifications and implementations? XD
2011-12-20T16:22:35  <flowenol> stocha i would try but i didnt want to compromise my country win
2011-12-20T16:22:39  <thestinger> mcstar: :P
2011-12-20T16:22:47  <thestinger> mcstar: I messed around with Go for a day or two
2011-12-20T16:23:01  <mcstar> typical of you
2011-12-20T16:23:08  <ChrisH_> yes, but I added runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1) at the start of my bot just to be safe
2011-12-20T16:23:23  <thestinger> mcstar: it's actually usually slower with more than 2 pthread
2011-12-20T16:23:27  <flowenol> stocha but i would try it if i wasnt interested in winning and see if i would go unnoticed
2011-12-20T16:23:30  <thestinger> because then it has to do locking on channels
2011-12-20T16:23:44  <stocha> flowenol: now the question is  .. how much having two thread give as an advantage if you gave it to someone randomly among the top 200 bot makers.
2011-12-20T16:23:45  <thestinger> they have a lot of optimization work to do
2011-12-20T16:23:51  <mcstar> unmutable concurrency ftw
2011-12-20T16:24:11  <ChrisH_> but separate threads are created when a system call is going to block, allowing other goroutines to continue running

2011-12-20T16:24:50  <flowenol> stocha it would depend on some factors, number of cpu cores, concurrent bots running etc
2011-12-20T16:25:18  <stocha> flowenol: do you think it's that easy to use the two thread efficiently rather than one ?
2011-12-20T16:25:18  <flowenol> what would be interesting too would use CUDA cores
2011-12-20T16:25:34  <stocha> flowenol: i would have loved that though
2011-12-20T16:25:40  <flowenol> stocha imo depends on the algorithms being run
2011-12-20T16:25:59  <flowenol> my code would be pretty useless with 2 threads
2011-12-20T16:26:07  <Wraithan> two theads means twice the cpu scheduler time (not completely true but true enough)
2011-12-20T16:26:09  <flowenol> wasnt developed thinking about using them
2011-12-20T16:26:14  <stocha> flowenol: my bots where using bit logic. (using the 64 bits bit instructions as simd). So cuda would have been ideal for me :)
2011-12-20T16:26:27  <bretep> I would add a timer that prevents me from timing out :v
2011-12-20T16:26:42  <stocha> flowenol: i was pissed off by the complexity of the combat rules though. I did implement it; but it hurted my aestetic feeling for simplicity
2011-12-20T16:26:44  <flowenol> stocha i would like to see cuda allowed
2011-12-20T16:26:48  <ChrisH_> my bot would definitely take advantage of two cores if it had them, one for noncombat and one for combat and they are highly parallel in my code
2011-12-20T16:26:49  <BenJackson> McLeopold: next contest at the final start it should just auto-rev everyone so that finals are a "new version" rather than having to clear out all the old info
2011-12-20T16:26:54  <mcstar> cuda?
2011-12-20T16:26:55  <mcstar> why?
2011-12-20T16:27:08  <mcstar> thats stream processing not multithreading
2011-12-20T16:27:17  <BenJackson> (meanwhile I'm trying to figure out if _Atsky_ is a late challenger or if it's noise)
2011-12-20T16:27:29  <bretep> Also, show the peak skill a bot has hit. :)
2011-12-20T16:27:29  <mcstar> did hea beat you?
2011-12-20T16:27:30  <flowenol> mcstar different thing, but still interesting to see what would people do with it
2011-12-20T16:27:43  <stocha> flowenol: it can hardly be though. But we can still organize a cuda ant contest if we find enougth people willing to try that. I think i would be happy to contribute then. Also let's use the more elegant ant dies if on same square combat rule :p
2011-12-20T16:27:50  <BenJackson> mcstar: he's beaten some players I recognize and he's in the top 10 right now
2011-12-20T16:27:54  <mcstar> flowenol: well, my algorithms wont play well on cuda :)
2011-12-20T16:28:03  <BenJackson> stocha: we should.  I have an nvidia tesla
2011-12-20T16:28:13  <flowenol> mcstar neither would mine
2011-12-20T16:28:29  <flowenol> BenJackson that card sucks, throw it in the garbage and tell me where
2011-12-20T16:28:38  <mcstar> :)
2011-12-20T16:28:51  <keith_> i am a research engineer at nvidia and i would vote for no cuda :)

2011-12-20T16:29:06  <stocha> BenJackson: i have a nvidia. That i never used for cuda. Although i bought it in the hope i would do some cuda stuff with it. What would the challenge look like ? Tcp only ? or a server like this one ?
2011-12-20T16:29:15  <flowenol> i have to confess u dont know much about cuda coding
2011-12-20T16:29:20  <flowenol> *i dont
2011-12-20T16:29:30  <BenJackson> flowenol: tesla S20xx (forget the exact model) it's the 1U box with CPU and 2 teslas
2011-12-20T16:29:43  <stocha> keith_: why ?
2011-12-20T16:29:44  <mcstar> on newer cards you could multiplex multiple bots on one card
2011-12-20T16:29:46  <BenJackson> not the S2050 that's 4 teslas (but no cpus, only external PCIe)
2011-12-20T16:29:47  <flowenol> BenJackson how much did it cost?
2011-12-20T16:29:56  <BenJackson> I don't know!  We bought it for some stupid reason at work
2011-12-20T16:29:57  <stocha> keith_: ant game seems very well suited for that doesn't it ?
2011-12-20T16:30:03  <BenJackson> but we didn't really use it so only I use it
2011-12-20T16:30:19  <stocha> BenJackson: what do you do with it ?
2011-12-20T16:30:24  <mcstar> BenJackson: we have supermicro workstattions, with 8 cores + 4 teslas + 48gb memories
2011-12-20T16:30:32  <BenJackson> screw around with CUDA
2011-12-20T16:30:36  <flowenol> I use my nvidia to do some md5 and lm crunching

2011-12-20T16:31:11  <stocha> That's a very good idea. I should do just that. Build an ant cuda bot. Even if it take a few month to build up my most basic stuff. It could be fun.
2011-12-20T16:31:21  <mcstar> lol
2011-12-20T16:31:25  <mcstar> and time wasting
2011-12-20T16:31:26  <BenJackson> ant cuda bot would be neat
2011-12-20T16:31:31  <stocha> i wonder how fast it can go.
2011-12-20T16:31:34  <keith_> any problem that can benefit much from cuda computation would probably come down to a competition in problem decomposition for parallel processing, exploitation of memory efficiencies, etc.  not an AI challenge anymore.  people who are very fluent in cuda, like me would have a huge advanage
2011-12-20T16:31:38  <BenJackson> boy the GAME ENGINE would run GREAT in CUDA

2011-12-20T16:33:54  <mcstar> btw my card  died

2011-12-20T16:36:34  <mcstar> stocha: antimatroid said he picked move randomly
2011-12-20T16:36:46  <bretep> I thought you meant something different with 'brute force monte carlo'
2011-12-20T16:36:49  <Zannick> flowenol: heh
2011-12-20T16:36:51  <flowenol> i use something based on a1k0n idea
2011-12-20T16:36:54  <mcstar> so he did some kind of sampling, i dont know the details
2011-12-20T16:36:57  <bretep> Although monte carlo is kinda brute force
2011-12-20T16:37:15  <flowenol> but to get them to do something different i first moved them all into the enemys and kept them static
2011-12-20T16:37:20  <stocha> bretep: i meant a very close to random things, with many many evaluation. Rather than clever simulation with good efficiency
2011-12-20T16:37:28  <flowenol> i was enough to influence them in the right way, most of the time
2011-12-20T16:38:04  <stocha> flowenol: so it's a montecarlo evaluation of a sort ?
2011-12-20T16:38:09  <flowenol> i wonder is it easy to implement A* with cuda

2011-12-20T16:38:19  <stocha> flowenol: how much position do you evaluate ?
2011-12-20T16:38:51  <stocha> flowenol:  i think my path solving would be very easy to implement with cuda.
2011-12-20T16:38:52  <flowenol> well with around 5 ants only to evaluate, around 10000 (on my computer)
2011-12-20T16:38:58  <besh> i think recursive algorithms are tough to implement with cuda
2011-12-20T16:39:13  <mcstar> more like inefficient
2011-12-20T16:39:18  <flowenol> for food i had a pseudo A*
2011-12-20T16:39:28  <stocha> flowenol: was 10 000 enough to get good behaviors ?
2011-12-20T16:39:36  <flowenol> stocha yea
2011-12-20T16:39:45  <stocha> flowenol: what's your bot name ?
2011-12-20T16:39:55  <flowenol> but with too many ants in combat i only would to around 50 iterations
2011-12-20T16:39:57  <flowenol> same as my nickname
2011-12-20T16:40:02  <stocha> flowenol: don't you loose an ant here or there from bad luck ?
2011-12-20T16:40:14  <BenJackson> all the ants I lose are bad luck
2011-12-20T16:40:16  <flowenol> stocha one ant vs 2 is rare
2011-12-20T16:40:16  <BenJackson> the ones I kill are skill
2011-12-20T16:40:17  <besh> mcstar: i have seen one attempt to implement alpha-beta for tic-tac-toe 3d that had some success
2011-12-20T16:40:27  <thestinger> BenJackson: lol :)
2011-12-20T16:40:28  <keith_> well, implementing something like A* in cuda is pretty easy -- it comes down to ensuring high occupancy on the cuda cores in order to achieve high parallelism.  unless you are running thousands of A* searches at once, this is difficult to do
2011-12-20T16:40:31  <flowenol> mostly bad luck i would say
2011-12-20T16:40:36  * avdg didn't test how many ants his bot would need to time out

2011-12-20T16:41:10  <avdg> mine already hit 600 ;-)
2011-12-20T16:41:14  <flowenol> but my code has checks for timeout on critical sections
2011-12-20T16:41:26  <besh> A* is easier i think but serial algorithms like alpha-beta are tough to parallelize efficiently

2011-12-20T16:46:35  <BenJackson> yes
2011-12-20T16:46:47  <a1k0n> that would be #1 on the tcp faq
2011-12-20T16:46:50  <BenJackson> not sure if he was B too
2011-12-20T16:46:58  <a1k0n> no, someone else was B, to his chagrin
2011-12-20T16:47:15  <stocha> flagcapper is only 16.
2011-12-20T16:47:16  <BenJackson> B on fluxid confused me because B was one of my local test bots (last pre-combat version)
2011-12-20T16:47:25  <BenJackson> so whenver I saw B do anything "smart" on fluxid it was jarring
2011-12-20T16:47:30  <stocha> amazing. i want to be 16 too.
2011-12-20T16:47:48  <BenJackson> I'm glad I'm not 16 now

2011-12-20T16:59:45  <conor_f> stocha: we'll probably play at some time, we're ranked similarly
2011-12-20T16:59:49  <stocha> conor_f: it's stocha.
2011-12-20T16:59:54  <besh> actually log-normal
2011-12-20T17:00:01  * avdg is probably the only one here that knows what normal distribution is
2011-12-20T17:00:20  <flowenol> avdg indeed
2011-12-20T17:00:25  * kost_ lols
2011-12-20T17:00:28  <mcstar> tell me
2011-12-20T17:00:30  <stocha> conor_f: the problem is my bot don't have combat nor hill awarness. So against similarly ranked bot, it will mostly conquer the map, and loose because of lowest score :)
2011-12-20T17:00:36  <avdg> at home

2011-12-20T17:00:47  <stocha> conor_f: although its particularly bad at conquest this particular one.
2011-12-20T17:01:04  <BenJackson> somehow I was confusing stocha and sashaSochka
2011-12-20T17:01:14  <BenJackson> so was was confused about the comments about "no combat awareness"
2011-12-20T17:01:15  <hexahedron> avdg: are you Russian?
2011-12-20T17:01:17  <stocha> BenJackson: yeah, close names
2011-12-20T17:01:23  <BenJackson> luckily sashaSochka disconnected to clear it up for me
2011-12-20T17:01:25  <avdg> no, flemish
2011-12-20T17:01:36  <erij> is anyone else still working on their bot even though finals are on?
2011-12-20T17:01:50  <conor_f> stocha: yeah, I can see from your games ;)
2011-12-20T17:02:03  <conor_f> I just implemented hill awareness the night of the competition close lol

2011-12-20T17:02:10  <stocha> BenJackson: in fact i did build bots in the early few weeks of the early beta. In those days there was flagcapper at the top with sir-macelon. And then one of my bot. And then a few more of my bot in the top bots :)
2011-12-20T17:02:10  <besh> erij: not me. but i have this urge to connect to tcp servers
2011-12-20T17:02:11  <f4hy> erij: I am, because my finals ended yesterday so I am finally free to work on it
2011-12-20T17:02:27  <bretep> I think the most I'm going to do is profile the games my bot timed out, barely any ants no fights, yet it times out :/
2011-12-20T17:02:31  <Anilm3> so... BenJackson is the boss now

2011-12-20T17:02:49  <Anilm3> haha
2011-12-20T17:02:52  <erij> besh/f4hy: I am.  using the tcpservers and competing against some other friends who have sent compiled/jar versions of their bots
2011-12-20T17:03:05  <besh> mcstar: yes. i can connect now
2011-12-20T17:03:12  <stocha> BenJackson: but bot flagcapper and sir-macelon were combat aware bots. mine weren't.
2011-12-20T17:03:13  <BenJackson> Anilm3: I will be a benevolent ruler
2011-12-20T17:03:22  <BenJackson> Anilm3: unless your ants get too close to my hill

2011-12-20T17:03:53  <conor_f> stocha: around 600 your ants look pretty combat aware :O
2011-12-20T17:04:04  <Anilm3> BenJackson: don't worry my ants will be respectful
2011-12-20T17:04:28  <stocha> conor_f: i think i uploaded this one because i liked how it looked when moving. Although it really seems drunk :)
2011-12-20T17:04:39  <BenJackson> stocha: wow you really snuck around blue's hill avoiding it there
2011-12-20T17:04:46  <BenJackson> multiple times!
2011-12-20T17:04:51  <conor_f> stocha: its really good
2011-12-20T17:05:00  <BenJackson> if only you'd just equated hills with food
2011-12-20T17:05:13  <bretep> lol, making a circle around the hill
2011-12-20T17:05:22  <BenJackson> red dies by getting his hill between you and lunch
2011-12-20T17:05:23  <stocha> BenJackson: most probably i would equate them with ants
2011-12-20T17:05:38  <BenJackson> ut oh, blue has a food behind it
2011-12-20T17:05:41  <BenJackson> this could be the end
2011-12-20T17:05:52  <BenJackson> NOOOO
2011-12-20T17:05:54  <conor_f> my bot had basically no ai in it :/ yet it still does ok for some reason...
2011-12-20T17:05:54  <BenJackson> hahaha
2011-12-20T17:05:56  <BenJackson> at turn 850ish
2011-12-20T17:06:01  <McLeopold> I like that map :)
2011-12-20T17:06:17  <stocha> i really have no idea what this particular bot is trying to do exactly. i only know that it doesn't see hills and doesn't know the combat rule
2011-12-20T17:06:21  <bretep> Food searching is smart anyway
2011-12-20T17:06:31  <bretep> My bot would send several for that food
2011-12-20T17:06:44  <bretep> Where he goes around the blue hill
2011-12-20T17:07:13  <f4hy> stocha: oh, we played each other

2011-12-20T17:07:39  <mcstar> BenJackson: you still have 15 skill to go
2011-12-20T17:07:47  <bretep> I want to play mcstar, he's one place higher then me in the pypy ranking. :)
2011-12-20T17:08:14  <flowenol> 600 minutes
2011-12-20T17:08:24  <flowenol> kill me or the starter bots
2011-12-20T17:08:39  <mcstar> bretep: sorry?
2011-12-20T17:08:40  <stocha> trouble is, my bot don't realize he does own hills :)
2011-12-20T17:08:48  <mcstar> who is?
2011-12-20T17:08:54  <bretep> mcstar: you're not agent smith?

2011-12-20T17:13:26  <FranPeruzzi> wow, just got 9 games in the last hour. After being one of the naysayers on the forum, I guess I should have had faith in the code.
2011-12-20T17:13:47  <McLeopold> okay, I'm playing on tc-pants now
2011-12-20T17:13:53  <flowenol> FranPeruzzi i still dont have much although i have around 14 games
2011-12-20T17:14:07  <mcstar> McLeopold: is it a real bot?

2011-12-20T17:14:14  <bretep> Connected to tcpants, mcstar
2011-12-20T17:14:16  <McLeopold> mcstar: yes, kinda
2011-12-20T17:14:23  <BenJackson> I'm going to be computing digits of pi and I'm willing to pay $20/cpu hr
2011-12-20T17:14:27  <mcstar> lets see :)
2011-12-20T17:14:51  <avdg> mine is better than what I expected, so I don't think I should be sad about that one
2011-12-20T17:14:52  <McLeopold> I'll probably time out
2011-12-20T17:15:03  <McLeopold> I need to comment out some logging...
2011-12-20T17:15:05  <mcstar> BenJackson: would be better to donate that money for these servers
2011-12-20T17:15:21  <Scryer> I liked the leaderboard better after my 4th game. :)
2011-12-20T17:15:30  <mcstar> anyway, Pi is best served in symbolic form
2011-12-20T17:15:58  <stocha> mcstar: see you mc. I'm disapointed i couldn't have those 20 hours i need to submit at least something :)

2011-12-20T17:16:58  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: thanks.  I was just conspiring to drive up the EC2 spot price for the remainder of the contest
2011-12-20T17:17:08  <ChrisH_> lol
2011-12-20T17:17:21  <Scryer> ChrisH - still 6 games, eh?  You're getting punished for standing up on the forum for the matching algorithm. :)
2011-12-20T17:17:24  <BenJackson> donations from anyone who likes their current rank accepted
2011-12-20T17:17:48  <BenJackson> Scryer: ChrisH_ actually has a good suggestion for fixing them
2011-12-20T17:17:57  <ChrisH_> Scryer: maybe, but I think it has more to do with having a high sigma because I've won all six
2011-12-20T17:17:59  <besh> i like it too. top100 is all i wanted . so yes.
2011-12-20T17:18:01  <BenJackson> but janzert is probably on a plane to the bahamas by now, fleeing the contest

2011-12-20T17:19:18  <McLeopold> so we can get everyone to 10 games and start the cutoffs
2011-12-20T17:19:22  <onion42> i'll be happy to finish in the top 500 :)
2011-12-20T17:19:32  <flowenol> McLeopold how about those with > than 10

2011-12-20T17:19:51  <amstan> i'm not exactly sure, what does janzert think?
2011-12-20T17:20:02  <ChrisH_> amstan: equal number of games is very important for far skills, otherwise variance in the sigma dominates too much
2011-12-20T17:20:04  <besh> onion42: will you be ok if we give you two more games ?

2011-12-20T17:20:23  <amstan> ChrisH_: yes, but sigma is not the same as game count

2011-12-20T17:21:16  <FranPeruzzi> besh: that's what I was jokingly thinking too
2011-12-20T17:21:17  <McLeopold> some starter bot :(
2011-12-20T17:21:18  <amstan> McLeopold: that is a funny looking table
2011-12-20T17:21:46  <amstan> i didn't realize that we had another peak at the start
2011-12-20T17:21:48  <onion42> i bet they punish me by throwing me in with xathis for a couple of 1vs1s lol
2011-12-20T17:21:52  <amstan> McLeopold: anyway, what does janzert think?
2011-12-20T17:22:01  <McLeopold> janzert isn't around
2011-12-20T17:22:02  <BenJackson> nice histogram
2011-12-20T17:22:07  <Anti> I had to play Cathie already
2011-12-20T17:22:09  <flowenol> 55 games? lucky bastard
2011-12-20T17:22:19  <ChrisH_> yeah, that table is very intersting and informative
2011-12-20T17:22:20  <BenJackson> it's probably a starter
2011-12-20T17:22:28  <amstan> McLeopold: ok, well.. change it, if nothing breaks it's probably fine
2011-12-20T17:22:34  <conor_f> when are they killing the noobs? :P
2011-12-20T17:22:46  <besh> lol
2011-12-20T17:23:01  <besh> conor_f":^
2011-12-20T17:23:01  <McLeopold> amstan: I'll kick in the logic as long as there is a bot with 6 games, then it will turn off
2011-12-20T17:23:08  <McLeopold> hopefully by that time janzert is back
2011-12-20T17:23:22  <onion42> yay, i might get some easy games :P
2011-12-20T17:23:48  <mcstar> @later tell g0llum theres a bug in your web app, it gives the incorrect user when i enter user id
2011-12-20T17:23:48  <contestbot> mcstar: As you wish.
2011-12-20T17:23:50  <BenJackson> McLeopold: do that for seeds only, right?
2011-12-20T17:24:01  <BenJackson> otherwise the 6s can only play other 6s and we still won't learn about their skills
2011-12-20T17:24:05  <McLeopold> BenJackson: seeds only
2011-12-20T17:24:18  <onion42> uhoh
2011-12-20T17:24:27  <McLeopold> and, it might not even make a difference
2011-12-20T17:24:35  <ChrisH_> so, i've got 6 games and 1217 in the queue before me, this will jump me at least halfway down the queue

2011-12-20T18:01:46  <flowenol> going fast
2011-12-20T18:01:52  <bluegaspode> ok - not a time to go to bed now :)
2011-12-20T18:02:04  <flowenol> but then it will be adjusted for the 7 game bots right?
2011-12-20T18:02:24  <bluegaspode> or maybe rather go to bed than to be depressed when my bot loses
2011-12-20T18:02:28  <BenJackson> as yet none challenge my hegemony

2011-12-20T18:04:08  <BenJackson> there are some really bad new maps
2011-12-20T18:04:22  <BenJackson> there's one with a 3 or 4 wide chokepoint really close to both player's spawns
2011-12-20T18:04:30  <BenJackson> which is only going to measure who gets one ant there first

2011-12-20T18:07:35  <flowenol> BenJackson interesting map
2011-12-20T18:07:35  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-12-20T18:07:37  <BenJackson> it might have the shortest average duration
2011-12-20T18:07:37  <bretep> That seems to be a map that's quickly decided
2011-12-20T18:07:52  <McLeopold> uh
2011-12-20T18:07:55  <BenJackson> 171.70 +/- 169.48
2011-12-20T18:07:59  <BenJackson> haha
2011-12-20T18:08:00  <McLeopold> its on the page
2011-12-20T18:08:06  <BenJackson> oh, sry
2011-12-20T18:08:12  <BenJackson> I have "maximize" saved for visualizer
2011-12-20T18:08:20  <BenJackson> I always forget there's stuff "under" the map
2011-12-20T18:08:40  <McLeopold> that's a great map, I love it

2011-12-20T18:09:25  <mcstar> yeah it really tests intelligence
2011-12-20T18:09:27  <BenJackson> ok not what I epxected
2011-12-20T18:09:43  <mcstar> if you stop there, and fight you wont get food
2011-12-20T18:09:54  <mcstar> and the other a coupl eof turns later will overpower you
2011-12-20T18:09:59  <BenJackson> you have to fight, the gap isn't wide enough
2011-12-20T18:10:03  <McLeopold> to zerg, or not to zerg

2011-12-20T18:10:15  <BenJackson> I think 2 strong bots will meet there and not get out
2011-12-20T18:10:18  <mcstar> gather food, and then fight
2011-12-20T18:10:22  <flowenol> that map may be mad for my bot

2011-12-20T18:10:40  <BenJackson> I thikn my bot may be great at it
2011-12-20T18:10:50  <mcstar> but if i remmeber correctly there are strictly food collectors
2011-12-20T18:10:51  <McLeopold> I can get you a list ordered by rank
2011-12-20T18:10:51  <besh> you just have to get one ant out
2011-12-20T18:10:56  <BenJackson> due to some metrics i put in to try to force fast expand on those kinds of maps
2011-12-20T18:11:00  <mcstar> i dont kknow if i commented it out or not
2011-12-20T18:11:17  <BenJackson> McLeopold: ideally by their rank NOW rather than as played

2011-12-20T18:16:56  <FranPeruzzi> McLeopold: my combat didn't think about hills, and when I added that, that component of my scoring function overwhelmed all the other components and made my ants extremely dumb near hills. Lesson learned.

2011-12-20T18:40:49  <Surya> sigma doesn't matter does it? It's the variance. The higher it is, the less the system is sure about the mu. Am I right? But yeah, I got higher mu, so I keep playing good bots (and eventually lose :))

2011-12-20T18:44:12  <McLeopold> we just need to send the servers into space really fast to speed up the process

2011-12-20T18:44:44  <McLeopold> onion42: nothing like that will happen for cutoffs
2011-12-20T18:44:50  <flowenol> pairofdice <100 bots worries me, mine will not make it there
2011-12-20T18:44:59  <pairofdice> Such is competition
2011-12-20T18:45:00  <Zannick> if the servers go at relativistic speeds, they'll experience less time than us :P
2011-12-20T18:45:05  <McLeopold> Zannick: from the servers perpective, we will be slow :)
2011-12-20T18:45:20  <pairofdice> Zannick, time also slows down near mass
2011-12-20T18:45:33  <onion42> we should send the servers back in time and run the competition last week :D
2011-12-20T18:45:55  <pairofdice> Near mass effect is probably higher than orbital velocity
2011-12-20T18:45:57  <avdg> lol, I wish we had portable mass boxes

2011-12-20T18:46:58  <mcstar> the proper sorting function changes with time, right now it is: (sortBy (on compare (\x->abs(x-198))))

2011-12-20T18:47:36  <amstan_> i never understood that
2011-12-20T18:47:47  <amstan_> you get time dilatation by going near the speed of light

2011-12-20T18:48:51  <amstan_> so.. which one experiences more severe time dilatation then?
2011-12-20T18:48:55  <mcstar> but accleration changes the picture
2011-12-20T18:48:58  <onion42> i mean their king is a lion
2011-12-20T18:49:01  <amstan_> since you don't know which one goes faster
2011-12-20T18:49:05  <mcstar> lol
2011-12-20T18:49:19  <mcstar> theres some serious errors in your thought process
2011-12-20T18:49:22  <mcstar> sorry
2011-12-20T18:49:59  <amstan_> so.. think of the classic example, like in planet of the apes

2011-12-20T18:50:08  <amstan_> you get a rocket leaving earth, and then coming back

2011-12-20T19:08:51  <ChrisH_> because there were 600+ 6 game bots that should all be at 7 now
2011-12-20T19:08:51  <McLeopold> yeah, 7 is after 6 :P
2011-12-20T19:09:17  <flowenol> there were at the paste McLeopold posted
2011-12-20T19:09:22  <flowenol> 441 7 game bots

2011-12-20T19:09:54  <flowenol> updated?
2011-12-20T19:09:59  <ChrisH_> yeah, for a total of about 1000 with either 6 or 7, now only 682 with 7, so it's like killing 2 birds with 1 stone
2011-12-20T19:10:03  <flowenol> cool
2011-12-20T19:10:24  <a1k0n> did you change the logic to pick seeds from the lowest game count then?
2011-12-20T19:10:28  <McLeopold> yes
2011-12-20T19:10:29  <pairofdice> holy ****, 66 games
2011-12-20T19:11:05  <besh> I noticed that those with 7 games are very stong engines !
2011-12-20T19:11:12  <besh> i.e on the first page
2011-12-20T19:11:32  <flowenol> so in 1 hour or so
2011-12-20T19:11:39  <flowenol> all bots should have 10 games
2011-12-20T19:12:02  <pairofdice> 682 bots can't all possibly fit on the first page ;)
2011-12-20T19:12:13  <besh> xathis,flagcapper,fourmidable,speedy_consoles,greantea,komaki ... conicidence ?
2011-12-20T19:12:30  <mcstar> i bet they would suck against starter bots
2011-12-20T19:12:37  <besh> pairofdice: ok. but still
2011-12-20T19:12:44  <a1k0n> yeah, they're only good against "good" bots
2011-12-20T19:12:52  <FranPeruzzi> The bots with 7 on any given page could be pretty strong compared to the rest on that page, wouldn't they?
2011-12-20T19:12:52  <a1k0n> so who's to say which bots are actually good?!

2011-12-20T19:13:30  <a1k0n> (yes i'm just kidding)
2011-12-20T19:13:34  <FranPeruzzi> They have to have higher mu value to balance out the higher sigma that (generally) goes with less games.
2011-12-20T19:13:45  <FranPeruzzi> So trueskill thinks they're better, but isn't sure yet
2011-12-20T19:14:15  <a1k0n> those sigmas are huuuge
2011-12-20T19:14:19  <mcstar> McLeopold: at least let the games play while your win prediction wont stabilize :)

2011-12-20T19:16:54  <a1k0n> it's not so much a product as a research paper

2011-12-20T19:42:27  <besh> That is interesting. Looking at your 2 vs 1 combats I was convinced some of the behaviour must come from search.
2011-12-20T19:42:34  <Extrarius> xathis: for considering the turn ahead, do you just consider the maximum number of enemies that could be "threatening" any given square? I was planning on trying that really simple approach had I time to work on my bot

2011-12-20T19:43:50  <xathis> ChrisH_: i yes i evaluated the states but i did not do all moves
2011-12-20T19:44:41  <ChrisH_> not sure what that means, I guess I'll figure it out when you publish your writeup (working on mine in another window BTW)
2011-12-20T19:44:50  <xathis> GreenTea: v1 had 7 hardcoded, now it's a bit different, i don'T look at all moves and thus can do a bit more but it depends on the way they are located
2011-12-20T19:44:58  <Extrarius> what was your heuristic for selecting which moves to look at?
2011-12-20T19:46:49  <xathis> Extrarius: not a heuristic, moving away from the enemy does not need to be considered in some cases

2011-12-20T19:47:48  <GreenTea> if ants is more then enemy ants then no need to consider moves away from enemy ants

2011-12-20T19:49:08  <xathis> ..a...b.. <- in this case you have to look what happens when you move a right, but you don't need to test what heppens when a moves left
2011-12-20T19:49:43  <GreenTea> why?
2011-12-20T19:49:46  <mcstar> but thats tricky, generalizing this alg
2011-12-20T19:49:48  <xathis> also if ..a...b.. in this example my ant a stays there i don't have to look at b at all

2011-12-20T19:50:48  <flowenol> how many remain
2011-12-20T19:51:12  <mcstar> i considered it but i thought it would be hard to implement

2011-12-20T19:51:38  <mcstar> and i was disappointed that i could only handle ~7-8 ants
2011-12-20T19:51:42  <mcstar> maybe 9
2011-12-20T19:51:45  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-12-20T19:51:50  <mcstar> i know i timed out at 10
2011-12-20T19:52:03  <mcstar> i could have been 9
2011-12-20T19:52:21  <mcstar> but at that time, i didnt have the battle code that i have now
2011-12-20T19:52:31  <mcstar> with this i cuold have handled large clusters
2011-12-20T19:52:40  <mcstar> and smaller ones with enumeration
2011-12-20T19:52:48  <Extrarius> I wonder if it'd be worth it to precompute tables of possibilities for squares of AxB and use chess-compression techniques to store and search a huge number of tables
2011-12-20T19:53:03  <GreenTea> i also have 2 distinct different battle calculations for <=7 ants and for >7 ants. have no time to make some hybryd

2011-12-20T19:53:15  <mcstar> Extrarius: even storing some things while enumerating had a performance hit
2011-12-20T19:53:24  <mcstar> i would say just compute everything on the fly
2011-12-20T19:53:42  <McLeopold> Extrarius: I split all ants into combat groups, then memorized formations for both sides
2011-12-20T19:53:57  <McLeopold> it helped with all the small battles
2011-12-20T19:53:59  <Extrarius> mcstar: storing has a penalty, but there is always a time/space tradeoff
2011-12-20T19:54:10  <besh> it is too big if you consider attac_radius+2 zone which had like 70 something squares

2011-12-20T19:54:28  <mcstar> 70?
2011-12-20T19:54:47  <besh> off the top of my head. I am not sure.
2011-12-20T19:54:49  <Extrarius> besh: but you don't have to consider all the squares, you cuold do something like generate tables for up to X enemy ants and Y of your ants
2011-12-20T19:54:51  <pairofdice> You only need to consider a small fraction of those
2011-12-20T19:54:54  <mcstar> that seems too much
2011-12-20T19:54:57  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-12-20T19:55:07  <mcstar> yep ok
2011-12-20T19:55:19  <besh> i remember it was bigger than a chess board.
2011-12-20T19:55:19  <mcstar> has the same magnitude
2011-12-20T19:55:39  <pairofdice> Ants at certain positions relative to your ants are an impossibilty due to combat
2011-12-20T19:55:40  <GreenTea> may good idea will be to store battle patters for different enemies and try to recognize them in future.. to predict enemy moves
2011-12-20T19:55:49  <mcstar> lol for the next contest lets apply chess rules!
2011-12-20T19:55:50  <Extrarius> it is bigger than a chess board, but the number of moves per piece is far fewer
2011-12-20T19:55:52  <GreenTea> but this is very complicated, i think

2011-12-20T19:56:33  <mcstar> and the engine spawns the ants with a specific role

2011-12-20T20:02:20  <Extrarius> python on the server is way slower than it is locally
2011-12-20T20:02:21  <besh> Extrarius: You would need to consider all of the squares I think. f.e for a 5 man chess endgame you still cosider the 64 squares
2011-12-20T20:02:22  <flowenol> had 3 timeouts in the official competition

2011-12-20T20:02:58  <avdg> yeah
2011-12-20T20:03:03  <flowenol> 600ish atm :D
2011-12-20T20:03:04  <Extrarius> besh: in chess, some pieces can move across the board. Ants can only move 1 square at a time, so you don't need to consider nearly as much state space per piece
2011-12-20T20:03:26  <flowenol> im aiming for top200
2011-12-20T20:03:54  <flowenol> lets see if i reach it
2011-12-20T20:03:56  <Extrarius> you would, though, need to consider squares at the periphery of your 'table' radius, but only for moves that possibly bring ants into the radius
2011-12-20T20:04:05  <janzert> I won't start raising the cutoff until all the better than starter bot bots have worked themselves above the starter bots in the rankings
2011-12-20T20:04:10  <besh> Etrarius: Yes if you consider only one ply search
2011-12-20T20:04:32  <flowenol> janzert and how will you know that
2011-12-20T20:04:45  <janzert> by watching :)
2011-12-20T20:04:54  <flowenol> thats a lot of work
2011-12-20T20:05:06  <janzert> yes
2011-12-20T20:05:06  <avdg> hmm, no stats? :/
2011-12-20T20:05:12  <besh> Also the attack zone could have waters in it
2011-12-20T20:05:14  * avdg has sad face
2011-12-20T20:06:06  <TL_> janzert: what about a cutoff of bottom 100 per hour? that would be 2400 bots in a day
2011-12-20T20:06:14  <Extrarius> besh: of course, which means you'd need a nifty storage mechanism so you could do something like prune moves that would move into water (so you wouldn't need to have water in your tables, just remove invalid moves)
2011-12-20T20:06:30  <avdg> TL_: why per hour?
2011-12-20T20:06:59  <pairofdice> why absolute amount and not a percentage
2011-12-20T20:07:12  <janzert> TL_: it'll move fast past the starter bots once they are sorted out, probably around 10 games for them
2011-12-20T20:07:13  <TL_> avdg: just a random idea

2011-12-20T21:04:46  <Extrarius> Scryer: 6000 starter bots and Extrarius's bot. Mine is written from scratch but times out at turn 100 or so =-/
2011-12-20T21:05:00  <rebelxt> are we still waiting for everyone to get to 10+ games?
2011-12-20T21:05:32  <Scryer> Extrarius: I have no problem with people who write terrible bots from scratch and lose faster than a starter bot with them.  No reason not to let them play until the cutoff.
2011-12-20T21:06:04  <McLeopold> 690 bots below 10 games
2011-12-20T21:06:08  <Extrarius> Scryer: Yeah, but the only reasonable way to cutoff is by rank, score, or some other stat that'll be really low for loser bots
2011-12-20T21:06:21  <rebelxt> McLeopold: tnx for update
2011-12-20T21:06:29  <Extrarius> My bot can win when the hills are close enough though =-)
2011-12-20T21:06:35  <BenJackson> McLeopold: what's your goal game count?
2011-12-20T21:06:45  <McLeopold> a bazillion
2011-12-20T21:07:18  <Scryer> Extrarius: As I mentioned on the forum, you can do a cryptographic hash to see if someone has changed anything from the starter bots. If the SHA1 of an executable matches SHA1 of a starter bot, no reason to measure its performance accurately.
2011-12-20T21:07:50  <Scryer> I agree with the concept of pruning failbots gradually, but the starter bots can be taken out instantly.
2011-12-20T21:09:45  <Extrarius> Scryer: I wish they'd have implemented a simple diff system, where it'd diff the source on upload and mark it as a "Start Bot" if it's less than 5% (for ex) different from the closest start bot
2011-12-20T21:11:04  <Scryer> I think *any* change should be allowed to compete and get pruned as normal, but opinions may differ.  Even 5% source diffs would be enough to make a sample improvement, considering how much of the starter bot is simply bookkeeping.

2011-12-20T21:11:52  <Extrarius> scryer: if they used a diff system, you could easily circumvent it by adding a large comment block or something if you wanted, but it'd prune out people that didn't care
2011-12-20T21:12:22  <kost_> Momobot has 1st version )
2011-12-20T21:12:24  <Randex> is there any way to launch a visualizer in a linux terminal?
2011-12-20T21:12:32  <Scryer> I'm suggesting a hash of the executable, not a diff of the source.
2011-12-20T21:13:13  <thestinger> well, you would need to hash the content of all the files
2011-12-20T21:13:15  <McLeopold> I would prefer a behavior test
2011-12-20T21:13:19  <kost_> Randex: don't know) you can run without a visualizer and save replay to html
2011-12-20T21:13:45  <McLeopold> hashes get messy and you can write some comments and have a "new" bot
2011-12-20T21:13:46  <Extrarius> Scryer: Many of the languages don't produce executables
2011-12-20T21:14:15  <McLeopold> for ants, it would be pretty easy to watch a bot ignore close food, go north and suicide
2011-12-20T21:14:22  <Extrarius> McLeopold: The point isn't to filter out people that don't want filtering, just to let people play a tiny bit and not get counted if they don't want
2011-12-20T21:14:48  <McLeopold> I'd also prefer an official tcp server as the first step, not submitting a "final" bot
2011-12-20T21:15:23  <Scryer> I agree that pruning on behavior is important and necessary.  I'm just saying that eliminating sample bots will clear up a great deal of the dead wood.
2011-12-20T21:15:31  <Extrarius> McLeopold: Definitely! Having a way to test immediately (and distribute the cpu requirements) would have been nice
2011-12-20T21:15:49  <McLeopold> tcp client baked into playgame
2011-12-20T21:16:02  <Extrarius> yeah

2011-12-20T22:20:36  <Migi32> if the next contest will also involve so many heuristics and scoring function weights as this one, I should really look into some ways of doing automated parameter tuning

2011-12-20T22:38:04  <ChrisH_> GreenTea released his code, so I guess anyone could do it now.

2011-12-20T22:47:06  <McLeopold> 289 bots at 9 games
2011-12-20T22:48:02  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I'm actually a bit surprised how quickly it is bringing the lower game bots up.

2011-12-20T22:57:05  <ChrisH_> thanks, that looks a lot better than before the change
2011-12-20T22:57:11  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-12-20T22:58:18  <McLeopold> I think we are churning through good bots, because we are down to 6.2 games per minute
2011-12-20T22:58:18  <ChrisH_> you've made the change "permanent" i see from github, so i'm going to update my forum post

2011-12-20T23:03:48  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I also see that the players ahead counter has been updated to at least partially reflect the new queue order. How often does it get recomputed?
2011-12-20T23:04:20  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: should be every page hit
2011-12-20T23:04:36  <McLeopold> the error now is that if you have 15 games and someone has 10, they are in line 5 times before you
2011-12-20T23:05:08  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: ok, it is curious that my counter doesn't go down when other games are played.
2011-12-20T23:05:09  <McLeopold> so, technically, it should say (there are 30,000 bots ahead of you)
2011-12-20T23:05:37  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: I also didn't do any ordering, so every bot at 15 will have the same "ahead" number
2011-12-20T23:05:41  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I have 10 games, so I would expect someone with 9 to play and slot in behind me based on least recent play tiebreak
2011-12-20T23:05:51  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: ahhh, ok
2011-12-20T23:06:02  <McLeopold> you won't see it go down until someone goes above you
2011-12-20T23:06:13  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-12-20T23:06:23  <McLeopold> I did less than or equal
2011-12-20T23:06:35  <McLeopold> so someone else with 10 appears ahead of you
2011-12-20T23:06:48  <ChrisH_> which makes it a worst case counter
2011-12-20T23:06:56  <McLeopold> the whole thing is nearly impossible to predict anyway
2011-12-20T23:07:11  <McLeopold> yeah, I figured getting a game earlier is nicer
2011-12-20T23:07:16  <ChrisH_> absolutely
2011-12-20T23:07:20  <McLeopold> it's all perceptions anyway

2011-12-20T23:15:59  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: caching?
2011-12-20T23:16:00  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: to prevent griping
2011-12-20T23:16:52  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: reasonable precaution. There's plenty of griping already, I wonder how much worse it would be.  ;)
2011-12-20T23:16:56  <McLeopold> Anyone can blog "I explore by looking for places I haven't seen", but it isn't very informative.
2011-12-20T23:17:16  <McLeopold> Did you do bfs?  From what point? How do you resolve ties?

2011-12-20T23:25:51  <_flag> Nevermind, ignore me then
2011-12-20T23:26:23  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: and I have 10 games and my profile says 703 players in front, which means 703 (or 704) 10 or 9 game bots to go

2011-12-20T23:27:42  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: at the rate my game counter is dropping, I'd say we are into the 10 game bots now, but not all the 9 game bots's games are finished playing yet

2011-12-20T23:28:19  <ChrisH_> yeah, i read that, very nice writeup, but I chose not to respond for the reason you stated
2011-12-20T23:28:43  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: care to bias me with comments before I watch your last few games?
2011-12-20T23:29:16  <ChrisH_> I didn't do well for two reasons, bad positioning and low food.
2011-12-20T23:29:24  <ChrisH_> but that happens
2011-12-20T23:30:17  <BenJackson> in ...029 I'd almost say that your multi-hill put the strength on the wrong hill
2011-12-20T23:30:23  <BenJackson> not that it could know
2011-12-20T23:30:40  <ChrisH_> pguillory just lost again
2011-12-20T23:31:08  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yeah, it looks great when it pulls those out, and not so great when it doesn't

2011-12-20T23:31:37  <amstan> McLeopold: if you were to sort by mu, you would have xathis, a1k0n, flagcapper and BenJackson near the top
2011-12-20T23:31:41  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: and it couldn't pull it out because of relatively low food and pkmiec rolled over too easy for the others
2011-12-20T23:31:41  <amstan> not with other bots in between
2011-12-20T23:32:18  <BenJackson> I'm already in 4th aren't I?

2011-12-20T23:32:42  <ChrisH_> amstan: I agree that he makes an excellent argument in his post.
2011-12-20T23:32:42  <BenJackson> oh I didn't realize xathis got bumped
2011-12-20T23:32:45  <BenJackson> I didn't expect that
2011-12-20T23:32:53  <amstan> BenJackson: yes, but your mu is second or something
2011-12-20T23:33:13  <BenJackson> amstan: I also agree with him but did not make that point mainly because I expected the tournament to run until sigmas were essentially equal
2011-12-20T23:33:54  <amstan> is that possible though?
2011-12-20T23:34:35  <BenJackson> if game selection optimized for it

2011-12-20T23:34:53  <BenJackson> it seemed that sigmas were converging to about 1.3 on the official server
2011-12-20T23:35:00  <BenJackson> on tcp servers they would stay high due to unevenness in the matchups

2011-12-20T23:36:14  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=299033&user=10 <- I saw you sit on your hill and immediately stopped to figure out where the multi-hills were
2011-12-20T23:36:18  <ChrisH_> yes, given a roughly equal number of games and a large enough sample, the sigmas should become much smaller and have less impact on the skill, but even before finals I always looked at the mu to see how I was doing.
2011-12-20T23:36:24  <BenJackson> your bots look awfully "thin" in that game
2011-12-20T23:37:36  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: That map seemd to have low food too, if that's what you mean.

2011-12-20T23:46:21  <andrei_c> hi all
2011-12-20T23:46:38  <andrei_c> can someone explain one moment in the game? I'm really confused
2011-12-20T23:46:59  <ChrisH_> andrei_c: ask your question, someone here can probably help
2011-12-20T23:47:37  <andrei_c> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=298652&user=11532   turn 460  coord 106,13
2011-12-20T23:48:10  <andrei_c> why the hell my ants (white) could not capture the hill with only one protector???
2011-12-20T23:48:18  <andrei_c> is it a bug?
2011-12-20T23:48:24  <ChrisH_> no

2011-12-20T23:49:27  <ChrisH_> the order of actions in the turn is 1. movement, 2. combat, 3. hill razing, 4. ant spawning, 5. food spawning
2011-12-20T23:49:47  *** meduza <meduza!b2b1d1a9@gateway/web/freenode/ip.178.177.209.169> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
2011-12-20T23:49:50  <ChrisH_> so you kill the one defender in step 2, but before you get to move again a new ant appears on the hill
2011-12-20T23:49:55  <Scryer> Unless he moves off the hill you need to kill each defender.
2011-12-20T23:49:58  <ChrisH_> in step 4
2011-12-20T23:50:18  <andrei_c> but why my ants die? they are in overwhelming majority
2011-12-20T23:50:36  <ChrisH_> and playing the game forward a bit it looks like blue is eating food so fast you can't kill them all
2011-12-20T23:50:58  <ChrisH_> if your ant steps on the hill while an enemy ant is there they both die in step 2 no matter how many friends you have nearby
2011-12-20T23:51:09  <ChrisH_> ant on ant collision is always death during combat
2011-12-20T23:51:13  <antimatroid> andrei_c: ants aren't allwed to collide
2011-12-20T23:51:28  <ChrisH_> well, they are allowed to, but it always kills them

2011-12-20T23:51:46  <ChrisH_> even if you step on your own ant, they both die with no enemy around
2011-12-20T23:51:48  <andrei_c> ok. thanks for explanation! I was totally unaware of this scenario. This had to be programmed specially :(
2011-12-20T23:52:04  <ChrisH_> no problem
2011-12-20T23:52:09  <BenJackson> the other thing you have to do specially is NOT STEP OFF your hill when it is surrounded
2011-12-20T23:52:10  <ChrisH_> sorry it didn't work out for you there
2011-12-20T23:52:15  <BenJackson> if you want to take advantage of the hive
2011-12-20T23:52:17  <BenJackson> I think I forgot to do that :)
2011-12-20T23:53:10  <ChrisH_> i didn't do that explicitly but my combat ants will suicide an enemy to stop it from stepping on the hill if needed, so that logic probably deals with it implicitly
2011-12-20T23:53:15  <BenJackson> I actually came up with a specific strategy there but never implemented it
2011-12-20T23:53:49  <BenJackson> to whit: if there are 2 enemies threatening your hill but none standing right next to it, step toward the nearer enemy and hope to suicide him
2011-12-20T23:53:53  <BenJackson> rather than just dying in combat
2011-12-20T23:53:58  <ChrisH_> ohh, i'm playing in a game now.  :)
2011-12-20T23:54:06  <Scryer> Looks like the failbot cutoff hasn't happened yet: 322 of the last 1000 games were won at turn 1
2011-12-20T23:54:20  <Scryer> It was 34% a couple of hours ago also.
2011-12-20T23:54:26  <BenJackson> Scryer: at least those are fast

2011-12-20T23:55:01  <Scryer> BenJackson: true enough.
2011-12-20T23:55:15  <ChrisH_> it probably takes longer to update the DB than play the game
2011-12-20T23:56:04  <Scryer> Does somebody still have that piratething top 10 list from a couple nights ago?
2011-12-20T23:56:35  <Scryer> I'd like to know who's missing.

2011-12-20T23:57:41  <antimatroid> xathis had his first loss
2011-12-20T23:57:54  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: you should have brokered a treaty between pguillory and nhaehnle
2011-12-20T23:58:00  <ChrisH_> seriously
2011-12-20T23:58:34  <BenJackson> did you have any special code for a wall of ants 3 wide and 13 deep vs 2 defenders?
2011-12-20T23:58:40  <ChrisH_> i almost got to joholm's hill at the end, but too little to late.
2011-12-20T23:59:11  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: no
2011-12-20T23:59:16  <BenJackson> I was watching your fight with hellow so when I glanced over and saw panela holding off a flood of purple I was pretty surprised
2011-12-20T23:59:46  <BenJackson> I would have expected pguillory not to get so bunchy
