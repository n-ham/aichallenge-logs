2012-06-30T07:50:23  <mcstar> added a bit of motor grease to the space key
2012-06-30T07:50:39  <mcstar> thestinger: how could you?
2012-06-30T07:50:44  <mcstar> remote-break it?
2012-06-30T07:51:24  <mcstar> i thought so
2012-06-30T07:51:26  <thestinger> I'll throw things to your wrong side of the world
2012-06-30T07:51:26  <mcstar> you cant break it
2012-06-30T07:53:01  <mcstar> btw, i dont remember the EU or central europe declaring war on canada
2012-06-30T07:53:35  <thestinger> we've always been at war with central europe
2012-06-30T07:55:36  <mcstar> did someone take your dolls, sonny?

2012-06-30T08:23:01  <mcstar> an AC is better
2012-06-30T08:23:12  <antimatroid> i have a heater on :P
2012-06-30T08:23:48  <mcstar> apple is great as long as you dont have to pay for it
2012-06-30T08:24:01  <mcstar> still, id feel locked in a cage on a mac
2012-06-30T08:29:35  <antimatroid> imo os x sucks
2012-06-30T08:29:42  <antimatroid> i couldn't bear it when i used it for a little while
2012-06-30T08:30:07  <antimatroid> alt tab semantics across spaces sucks, moving windows between spaces sucks, can't cut files/folders wtf
2012-06-30T08:30:15  <antimatroid> imo that's unuseable
2012-06-30T08:30:42  <antimatroid> and i'm not paying money to update the os just so i can cut files/folders, that would be retarded

2012-06-30T08:47:41  <mcstar> i dont remember such things
2012-06-30T08:47:59  <thestinger> I need i3 or I'll go insane :P
2012-06-30T08:48:27  <mcstar> is i3 dynamic?
2012-06-30T08:48:40  <thestinger> no, manual (but different than most manual tilers)
2012-06-30T08:48:40  <mcstar> thel ayout i mean
2012-06-30T08:48:49  <mcstar> i need dynamic
2012-06-30T08:48:52  <thestinger> represents each workspace as a tree of windows or containers
2012-06-30T08:48:54  <thestinger> mcstar: why?
2012-06-30T08:49:10  <mcstar> i dont want to bother with manual
2012-06-30T08:49:12  <thestinger> open window, open second window and the screen is split in 2
2012-06-30T08:49:18  <thestinger> mcstar: manual doesn't mean more work
2012-06-30T08:49:54  <thestinger> open window, open 2nd window (screen is split in 2 down the middle now)
2012-06-30T08:49:57  <mcstar> well, i saw a stumpwm vide once, it is a manual manager, and you had to partition the space before you opened some window
2012-06-30T08:50:01  <thestinger> mod+v in one of them, open another window
2012-06-30T08:50:09  <thestinger> mcstar: not all manual tilers are the same
2012-06-30T08:50:12  <thestinger> i3 just uses a tree
2012-06-30T08:50:17  <thestinger> splits can be vertical or horizontal
2012-06-30T08:50:35  <thestinger> you only have to switch between vsplit and hsplit as you want
2012-06-30T08:50:53  <thestinger> the top level is a tree and they come down from that (and there are containers that can hold more than one window)
2012-06-30T08:50:58  <thestinger> along with tabbing and stacking windows
2012-06-30T08:51:01  <mcstar> im not sure if i need that
2012-06-30T08:51:11  <mcstar> awesome provides all the things i need
2012-06-30T08:51:31  <mcstar> id use xmonad, but it lack mouse support
2012-06-30T08:51:34  <thestinger> mcstar: http://ompldr.org/vZWtjZg takes me 2 seconds to open my windows like that
2012-06-30T08:51:35  <mcstar> lacks*
2012-06-30T08:51:38  <thestinger> open two, mod-v mod-s
2012-06-30T08:51:40  <thestinger> done
2012-06-30T08:52:08  <thestinger> it's a laptop so I just do a split down the middle (it's 1920x1080 but the screen is 15.6 inches)
2012-06-30T08:52:52  <mcstar> the stacking is interesting
2012-06-30T08:53:08  <thestinger> can be tabs too (horizontal, and doesn't waste vertical space)
2012-06-30T08:53:14  <thestinger> I find stacking easier to parse with my eyes though
2012-06-30T08:53:53  <mcstar> anyway, most of the windows i use are full-screen
2012-06-30T08:54:10  <mcstar> maybe when ill have a bigger monitor..
2012-06-30T08:56:06  <thestinger> mcstar: I can't stand dynamic ones for actually tiling
2012-06-30T08:56:15  <thestinger> I can't actually ever get a layout I want
2012-06-30T08:56:40  <thestinger> if you just have windows fullscreen, it doesn't matter which one you use :P
2012-06-30T08:59:08  <mcstar> i rarely split
2012-06-30T08:59:31  <mcstar> im just scattered over all 9 workspaces
2012-06-30T08:59:44  <thestinger> ah
2012-06-30T08:59:51  <thestinger> I've stopped using workspaces now most of the time
2012-06-30T08:59:55  <mcstar> there is one annoying bug(?) in awesome
2012-06-30T09:00:02  <thestinger> I just stack stuff :P
2012-06-30T09:00:17  <thestinger> you can move multiple windows as a group in i3 because you can "focus parent"
2012-06-30T09:00:32  <mcstar> when i switch to a workspace and swtich back to the previous, the focused window can lose focus
2012-06-30T09:07:41  <mcstar> antimatroid: youre right, seems it wasnt possible to cut files in finder
2012-06-30T09:07:57  <mcstar> probably you are supposed to drag and drop
2012-06-30T09:08:26  <mcstar> i used mucommander for a short time

2012-06-30T09:37:40  <antimatroid> lol
2012-06-30T09:39:33  <thestinger> I only actually care about icons for browsing images and sxiv has a thumbnail mode
2012-06-30T09:39:38  <antimatroid> mcstar: also, drap and dropping is lame
2012-06-30T09:39:39  <thestinger> so I never use a file manager anymore
2012-06-30T09:39:43  <thestinger> ever
2012-06-30T09:39:45  <antimatroid> what if you want to move a file to the parent folder for example?
2012-06-30T09:40:04  <mcstar> you can hold the cursor on anything and it will open
2012-06-30T09:40:12  <antimatroid> too slow
2012-06-30T09:40:19  <mcstar> yeah, theres a delay
2012-06-30T09:40:26  <mcstar> hey,  im not trying to defend d&d
2012-06-30T09:40:32  <antimatroid> or they could not be retarded and let people cut
2012-06-30T09:40:44  <antimatroid> i haven't touched my macbook pro in like 3-4 months
2012-06-30T09:40:48  <antimatroid> it's sitting in the corner of my room
2012-06-30T09:40:50  <mcstar> supposedly 'cut' was conceptually hard to grasp
2012-06-30T09:40:53  <antimatroid> i have no use for a laptop anyway :|
2012-06-30T09:40:57  <mcstar> 'where does the file go when i cut it'
2012-06-30T09:41:05  <thestinger> antimatroid: really? I use my laptop all the time
2012-06-30T09:41:06  <antimatroid> typical apple
2012-06-30T09:41:09  <thestinger> I don't like being stuck in a room
2012-06-30T09:41:23  <antimatroid> thestinger: i ride my bike places and have a desktop in my room and office at uni
2012-06-30T09:41:39  <antimatroid> and i don't really need a computer unless i'm typing shit
2012-06-30T09:41:53  <antimatroid> i can play with paper and pacer for reasonable amounts of time
2012-06-30T09:42:08  <mcstar> pen and paper
2012-06-30T09:42:11  <mcstar> ?
2012-06-30T09:42:16  <antimatroid> pacer*
2012-06-30T09:42:21  <mcstar> whats a pacer?
2012-06-30T09:42:29  <antimatroid> hang on
2012-06-30T09:42:58  <antimatroid> my internet is being really slow
2012-06-30T09:43:38  <mcstar> id use the laptop all the time, had i had one
2012-06-30T09:43:49  <thestinger> really, I hate sitting in my room at my desktop
2012-06-30T09:43:53  <mcstar> yeah
2012-06-30T09:44:43  <thestinger> laptop means I can be outside _and_ still not have a real life :P
2012-06-30T09:44:43  <mcstar> antimatroid: i could have googled pacer by now
2012-06-30T09:44:50  <mcstar> thestinger: haha
2012-06-30T09:44:58  <antimatroid> http://www.stationeryart.com/images/pentel_techniclick_pink_t.jpg
2012-06-30T09:45:01  <thestinger> and my dog likes it when I sit in the back yard with him
2012-06-30T09:45:07  <antimatroid> i have used that for about 7 years now
2012-06-30T09:45:15  <antimatroid> not the same exact pacer, but same colour etc.
2012-06-30T09:45:32  <mcstar> antimatroid: you made me wait for a pic the size of an icon?
2012-06-30T09:45:39  <antimatroid> to get more lead/graphite you just flick your fingers and click
2012-06-30T09:45:47  <antimatroid> my interwebs is being painfully slow
2012-06-30T09:45:50  <antimatroid> i said this
2012-06-30T09:45:53  <thestinger> mcstar: it's even smaller than an icon here
2012-06-30T09:46:38  <thestinger> I guess it depends on the type of icon :P
2012-06-30T09:46:42  <mcstar> 'only 0.5kb porn images today, im close to the download limit...' thought antimatroid
2012-06-30T09:47:28  <mcstar> antimatroid: we call that type of pen rotring
2012-06-30T09:47:38  <mcstar> i have 2 of itmyself
2012-06-30T09:47:51  <mcstar> one is very good, i can spin it with my fingers
2012-06-30T09:50:46  <mcstar> thestinger: no file manager at all? not even ranger? or mc?
2012-06-30T09:50:54  <thestinger> I have ranger installed
2012-06-30T09:50:56  <mcstar> im trying to make myself use mc
2012-06-30T09:50:57  <thestinger> don't use it at all
2012-06-30T09:51:06  <thestinger> sxiv thumbnail mode for images
2012-06-30T09:51:06  <antimatroid> i'm not very skilled with flipping them
2012-06-30T09:51:10  <thestinger> zsh for everything else
2012-06-30T09:51:31  <thestinger> mcstar: I find it faster just to use mv, cp, zmv, etc.
2012-06-30T09:51:55  <mcstar> hm
2012-06-30T09:52:03  <thestinger> I can be lazy and type /v/l/me<TAB> for /var/log/messages.log, etc.
2012-06-30T09:52:11  <thestinger> and just use menu completion for everything
2012-06-30T09:52:26  <thestinger> I don't even have to read man pages since the switches for most things like git get autocompleted
2012-06-30T09:52:48  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vZWtkOA <3
2012-06-30T09:52:52  <mcstar> i used dolphin, while it had miller columns
2012-06-30T09:52:57  <mcstar> after that thunar and ranger
2012-06-30T09:53:28  <mcstar> ouch
2012-06-30T09:53:30  <mcstar> thats nice
2012-06-30T09:54:59  <thestinger> if I still had to deal with bash I would probably use ranger
2012-06-30T09:55:13  <mcstar> its a bit slow though
2012-06-30T09:55:39  <mcstar> and mc is everywhere, thats why id like to learn to use it
2012-06-30T09:55:52  <thestinger> zsh even ships on OS X :P
2012-06-30T09:56:35  <mcstar> thestinger: did you know mc had not only 2-pane view?
2012-06-30T09:57:24  <mcstar> anyway, if you know how to use it, you can be probably more effective in it than pure shell
2012-06-30T09:57:43  <mcstar> here it comes...
2012-06-30T09:58:08  <mcstar> now you say, i dont know what im talking about...
2012-06-30T09:58:11  <mcstar> XD
2012-06-30T10:01:07  <thestinger> well, depends on what you're doing
2012-06-30T10:01:14  <thestinger> I'm usually not just managing files
2012-06-30T10:01:25  <thestinger> sometimes I do systemic moves
2012-06-30T10:01:28  <thestinger> but zmv is good for that
2012-06-30T10:01:54  <thestinger> like... zmv '(*)' '${(L)1}' to make files lowercase
2012-06-30T10:02:22  <thestinger> can turn spaces to underscores too
2012-06-30T10:03:38  <thestinger> if you actually have to move files from a few sources to a few destinations (maybe some in groups) then a file manager with good keybindings is probably faster :P
2012-06-30T10:03:45  * thestinger never has to do stuff like that
2012-06-30T10:04:08  <thestinger> pretty much why I have ranger and never use it
2012-06-30T10:04:54  <mcstar> i just dont want to remember a gazillion of keybindings
2012-06-30T10:05:07  <mcstar> i want to stick with something
2012-06-30T10:05:13  <mcstar> to*
2012-06-30T10:05:19  <thestinger> coreutils :P
2012-06-30T10:14:37  <mcstar> You can lead a horse to water, but you can't beat him over the head with a pail and expect him to be happy about it.
2012-06-30T10:14:56  <mcstar> last line in a zsh workshop
2012-06-30T10:22:17  <mcstar> latest firefox does something right at least
2012-06-30T10:22:34  <mcstar> it doesnt load up again all the pages from my previous session
2012-06-30T10:22:46  <mcstar> only loads the ones i explicitely visit
2012-06-30T10:23:06  <thestinger> I still can't get over how ridiculous 3d inspection is
2012-06-30T10:23:10  <thestinger> mcstar: have you seen that feature?
2012-06-30T10:23:18  <mcstar> yes
2012-06-30T10:23:32  <mcstar> i dont need inspection
2012-06-30T10:23:43  <thestinger> I love it when I want to scrape stuff from a site
2012-06-30T10:23:59  <thestinger> I just hit inspect and click the element, and I can see what the hierarchy is like and use xpath or css selectors in lxml
2012-06-30T10:24:14  <thestinger> takes 10 secs instead of looking through the source and it being painful
2012-06-30T10:24:21  <mcstar> i use the info browser to save google books pages

2012-06-30T13:20:25  <delt0r> I had a 6 pack without even trying when i was young

2012-06-30T13:20:50  <mcstar> -s
2012-06-30T13:21:57  <pairofdice> I had a 6pack when I still used to bicycle the 3miles to school every day
2012-06-30T13:22:17  <pairofdice> Like 15 years ago...
2012-06-30T13:22:24  <delt0r> I hope to do a lot more skiing next year... that should help...
2012-06-30T13:22:37  <delt0r> pairofdice: how old are you?

2012-06-30T13:23:49  <pairofdice> I've started running a couple times but ...
2012-06-30T13:24:02  <delt0r> pairofdice: So you just decided to learn? or went back to uni?
2012-06-30T13:24:58  <pairofdice> Mostly just decided to learn, going to "uni" came later
2012-06-30T13:25:14  <delt0r> right
2012-06-30T13:25:15  <pairofdice> just the online version ;p
2012-06-30T13:25:40  <delt0r> yea... i think that is where a lot of retraining course are going
2012-06-30T13:26:01  <delt0r> but with exams or something at a uni proper at the end. Too much cheating otherwise
2012-06-30T13:27:29  <pairofdice> mcstar: how many times a week do you run
2012-06-30T13:27:46  <mcstar> at least every other day
2012-06-30T13:27:54  <mcstar> sometimes 2x in a row
2012-06-30T13:28:46  <mcstar> i was very worried initially because of my injured left ankle
2012-06-30T13:28:51  <mcstar> but it holds so far
2012-06-30T13:29:13  <mcstar> sometimes aches, but nothing serious
2012-06-30T13:29:40  <delt0r> I have a knee thing... So i was told to cycle instead
