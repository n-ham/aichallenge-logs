2011-12-16T00:00:02  <antimatroid> i think the trick is knowing when to move it off?
2011-12-16T00:00:03  <BenJackson> and that's when you don't want to waste ants

2011-12-16T00:00:37  <BenJackson> to look at turn 75 the map looks very random

2011-12-16T00:00:53  <ChrisH_> ant so far my system seems to work well in most cases, but I did have to rethink a bit about my strategic priorities of food vs. explore, vs. attack hills and enemy ants

2011-12-16T00:11:13  <_flag> Oh, didn't realize tcpants was popular
2011-12-16T00:11:13  <codetiger> in just 4 games, then its awesome
2011-12-16T00:11:15  <ldlework> I have been writing this exact thing I can't believe there is a challenge

2011-12-16T00:11:35  <BenJackson> _flag: it was definitely less popular than fluxid

2011-12-16T00:11:40  <ldlework> antimatroid, I have been writing a 2D cellular agent simulation system for a few weeks now
2011-12-16T00:11:41  <BenJackson> until people realized fluxid's db was corrupt
2011-12-16T00:11:43  <antimatroid> i just switched before cause of speed
2011-12-16T00:12:02  <_flag> antimatroid: I know, I just didn't know there were alternatives with top players on them
2011-12-16T00:12:12  <ldlework> antimatroid, I use genetic algorithms to breed creatures in the system. Ugh, I just can't believe it.
2011-12-16T00:12:15  <_flag> tcpants actually appears to have better games than fluxid

2011-12-16T00:13:20  <ldlework> Is anyone using evolvers for this challenge?
2011-12-16T00:13:57  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: yes, yes he does
2011-12-16T00:14:08  <antimatroid> ldlework: not i
2011-12-16T00:15:08  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: is that old?
2011-12-16T00:15:11  <ldlework> If anyone has python installed and wants to try my parallel project to this competition, https://github.com/dustinlacewell/eater-experiment
2011-12-16T00:15:15  <BenJackson> I could swear we talked about it on irc
2011-12-16T00:15:19  <ldlework> it requires pyevolve
2011-12-16T00:15:39  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: no, that was my most recent game
2011-12-16T00:15:47  <ChrisH_> 30 minutes ago
2011-12-16T00:15:53  <BenJackson> ldlework: years ago (after getting mad at chapter 1 of _The Selfish Gene_) I wrote a generic algoritm that evolved ants that eat
2011-12-16T00:15:56  <BenJackson> similar to this
2011-12-16T00:16:05  <BenJackson> it actually evolved microcode to search and move and eat
2011-12-16T00:16:06  <ldlework> Nice.
2011-12-16T00:16:10  <BenJackson> it was really interesting
2011-12-16T00:16:30  <ldlework> BenJackson, my agents use a look up table for what their neighbors are, to what action they should take
2011-12-16T00:16:37  <ldlework> except they have 10 of these stables
2011-12-16T00:16:54  <BenJackson> I had something like 10 opcodes
2011-12-16T00:16:54  <ldlework> what they see maps to the action and the new state
2011-12-16T00:17:01  <BenJackson> eat, go forward, turn left, turn right, skip, again, reset
2011-12-16T00:17:03  <ldlework> so they can have multi-step behaviors
2011-12-16T00:17:08  <BenJackson> some of those pushed booleans on a stack
2011-12-16T00:17:10  <BenJackson> some consumed them
2011-12-16T00:17:28  <BenJackson> and it would just breed instruction strings until ants could find food on their own
2011-12-16T00:17:31  <BenJackson> oh, "look"
2011-12-16T00:17:31  <BenJackson> is food ahead of me
2011-12-16T00:17:48  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: In fact, it is the current game on the home page.  ;)

2011-12-16T00:18:01  <ldlework> right the way I do it is simply a full map of every possible combination of what they can see to random actions
2011-12-16T00:18:16  <ldlework> oh, "look" there's a plant infront of me
2011-12-16T00:18:18  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: your bot looks super dominant in that game and pretty much lost
2011-12-16T00:18:38  <BenJackson> also I was pretty stoked when I noticed myself on the front page once
2011-12-16T00:18:41  <ldlework> BenJackson, I have two breeds in my system. PEaters that gain fitness from eating plants
2011-12-16T00:18:45  <BenJackson> but I don't pay attention so it was a fluke I noticed
2011-12-16T00:18:52  <ldlework> and MEaters who gain fitness from eating the PEaters
2011-12-16T00:18:58  <BenJackson> hah
2011-12-16T00:19:09  <ldlework> the PEaters evolve both plant seeking behaviors and MEater avoidance behaviors
2011-12-16T00:19:28  <ldlework> The progression of evolved behaviors in the system are drastically different depending on whether there are MEaters in the system
2011-12-16T00:19:28  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yeah, it's the balance between early aggression and territory control
2011-12-16T00:20:10  <antimatroid> http://tcpants.com/replay.1486 it ends the games pretty early aye?
2011-12-16T00:20:16  <ldlework> I really really wish I would have known about this :(
2011-12-16T00:20:21  <_flag> The turn limit on tcpants is only 750 though
2011-12-16T00:20:28  <ChrisH_> But here's the thing, teritory control will often lead to at least a middle of the pack finish, while early aggression will lead to an all or nothing bot
2011-12-16T00:20:55  <antimatroid> i feel robbed of that game
2011-12-16T00:21:05  <BenJackson> antimatroid: yeah at 750
2011-12-16T00:21:16  <_flag> Both my games so far didn't have enough turns
2011-12-16T00:21:19  <antimatroid> _flag: but it got called off even before that, for not razing hills
2011-12-16T00:21:26  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: yep
2011-12-16T00:21:30  <antimatroid> look at the end of the game :|
2011-12-16T00:21:38  <BenJackson> I've been migrating from an all-or-nothing to territory bot over time
2011-12-16T00:21:48  <antimatroid> i broke through their barriers and just made it to almost claiming their hill, and no go apparently :(
2011-12-16T00:21:51  <_flag> antimatroid: Oh wow, I hate it when it does that
2011-12-16T00:22:17  <ChrisH_> and since a lot of the other top bots go for territory as well it is hard to get close enough to their hills to be successful against them with an aggressive attack
2011-12-16T00:22:37  <BenJackson> antimatroid: OH that's not the turn limit, ahahahah
2011-12-16T00:22:48  <antimatroid> janzert: http://tcpants.com/replay.1486 I don't think that game should have ended, hmph :(
2011-12-16T00:23:11  <janzert> tcpants seems like it is using very aggressive cutoffs
2011-12-16T00:23:17  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: even being "early aggressive" doesn't always help
2011-12-16T00:23:24  <antimatroid> who runs tcpants?
2011-12-16T00:23:31  <antimatroid> i wonder if the ants not razing is any more agressive
2011-12-16T00:23:37  <BenJackson> I lost a 3-way battle when I actually got to the enemy first, drew off his defenders and let the 3rd guy in
2011-12-16T00:23:49  <BenJackson> I stared at that game wondering wtf I could do differently
2011-12-16T00:23:49  <ChrisH_> yep
2011-12-16T00:24:16  <ChrisH_> but you can't win every single game unless the competition isn't any good
2011-12-16T00:24:23  <ChrisH_> so you just got to let some slide
2011-12-16T00:24:35  <antimatroid> yeah, it's all about playing best in general
2011-12-16T00:24:38  <janzert> antimatroid: well there's certainly no way you had >85% of ants for 150 turns
2011-12-16T00:24:41  <ChrisH_> and let the law of averages work in your favor
2011-12-16T00:25:12  <antimatroid> okay cool
2011-12-16T00:25:53  <janzert> looks like his cutoff might be >65% for 150 turns possibly
2011-12-16T00:26:08  <ChrisH_> janzert: what's up with my match schedule, I got a bunch of lame match quality games to start after I resubmitted, then all of a sudden I got six matches in 13 minutes and vaulted into the top 25 without even realizing.
2011-12-16T00:26:10  <antimatroid> yeah i just care about the official server settings :)
2011-12-16T00:26:35  <BenJackson> janzert: yeah, what's up with that.  I want that too
2011-12-16T00:26:48  <janzert> the pairing is having a hard time keeping up with the game rate at times
2011-12-16T00:26:51  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: but seriously I think what happens is your mu hits some threshold where you can be pulled into other people's games
2011-12-16T00:26:57  <ChrisH_> you don't want the first 8 lame matches I bet
2011-12-16T00:27:13  <janzert> so ends up repeatedly giving the same person repeated seed
2011-12-16T00:27:17  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I think that's part of it, but I've never seen this many in a row before.
2011-12-16T00:27:19  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: if it got me into the top 1000...

2011-12-16T00:29:05  <ChrisH_> janzert: any idea why I was getting so many matches against opponents with a mu 10 less than mine early in my submission's history?
2011-12-16T00:29:36  <janzert> probably they had played significantly less games than the bots closer in mu
2011-12-16T00:29:44  <janzert> in the past 24 hours that is
2011-12-16T00:29:53  <janzert> that'd be my initial guess at least
2011-12-16T00:30:28  <BenJackson> ah, we have too few mid-tier bots to support all the resubmits of the top tier
2011-12-16T00:30:30  <ChrisH_> makes sense, but it seemed to be a pattern, I would expect it to be more random: I would get some the other direction too, but they were always low
2011-12-16T00:30:45  <Scryer> My most recent match was against 2 deactivated bots. One ("virus") has had 6 matches since then and the other ("jocke") had one... and I'm still sitting there.
2011-12-16T00:30:54  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: but! there are even fewer ones with higher mu
2011-12-16T00:30:55  <janzert> the higher ranks have lots of games pretty evenly
2011-12-16T00:32:56  <ChrisH_> well, all is well that ends well, I have learned that my recent changes seem successful, but the matching system seems to be getting a bit unstable
2011-12-16T00:33:39  <ChrisH_> It will be pretty wild when we reset for finals.
2011-12-16T00:34:05  <antimatroid> up to 13th
2011-12-16T00:35:03  <janzert> for the finals I'm going to run a few rounds of random pairings to kickstart the pairing system
2011-12-16T00:35:29  <ChrisH_> that makes sense
2011-12-16T00:35:33  <Scryer> "virus" has now had 9 since his match with me.  That's 3 more than when I whined up there at 21:30.
2011-12-16T00:36:33  <antimatroid> janzert: that sounds good
2011-12-16T00:36:58  <thestinger> Scryer: wow, what the hell?
2011-12-16T00:37:20  <Scryer> Yes, exactly what I was wondering.
2011-12-16T00:37:35  <matthewd> Scryer: Technically, he hasn't had any matches... he's being used in them.
2011-12-16T00:37:48  <ChrisH_> ok, i've got tests to run and code to work on, IRC off.

2011-12-16T00:38:30  <Scryer> Yes, but he's been used in 11 matches.  How does this makes sense again?
2011-12-16T00:39:43  <antimatroid> i don't think it cares about how many games opponents have had when picking them
2011-12-16T00:39:48  <janzert> in past 24 hours he's been in 16 total
2011-12-16T00:40:11  <janzert> so he'll be past over pretty soon here until tomorrow again
2011-12-16T00:40:16  <janzert> antimatroid: it does
2011-12-16T00:40:23  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-12-16T00:41:00  <Scryer> Hmm.
2011-12-16T00:42:23  <janzert> he's favored by the pairing system because of a low sigma so he'll get picked whenever his game number in the past 24 hours drop senough to make him favorable again
2011-12-16T00:42:49  <antimatroid> damn tcp is distracting :P
2011-12-16T00:42:59  <janzert> favored for games occurring with a close mu of course
2011-12-16T00:43:15  <Scryer> OK. So working as intended?
2011-12-16T00:44:08  <janzert> you'll notice he had no games between Dec 15th 6:08am and Dec 16th 4:49am
2011-12-16T00:44:27  <janzert> Scryer: more an unintended side effect, but not harmful
2011-12-16T00:45:35  <janzert> and none from 14th 5:13am to 15th 4:37am
2011-12-16T00:46:45  <Scryer> OK. I'll nap out and pay attention to my own games instead, then. :)

2011-12-16T01:32:52  <codetiger> I mean, count enemies vs ally around k radius near enemy ant hill to decide sacrifices
2011-12-16T01:33:44  <codetiger> coz, razing is more valuable isn't it

2011-12-16T01:39:24  <antimatroid> my thoughts are that the company who owns the software is at fault if it messes up? which makes insurance difficult
2011-12-16T01:39:27  *** ldlework <ldlework!~dlacewell@c-67-184-74-34.hsd1.il.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-12-16T01:39:29  <pairofdice> But atleast the goal is to have a lot less crashes
2011-12-16T01:39:32  <antimatroid> presumably you want the driver to be paying the insurance
2011-12-16T01:39:37  <antimatroid> but to cover the patent holder
2011-12-16T01:39:47  <antimatroid> is it? or lazyness? :P
2011-12-16T01:40:21  <antimatroid> if human lives were really worth any cost, nobody would drive anywhere except emergency/delivery vehicles
2011-12-16T01:40:22  <pairofdice> Over a million fatalities a year is a good motivator
2011-12-16T01:41:03  <pairofdice> Right...
2011-12-16T01:41:23  <antimatroid> that's my response to people who say no expense is too much to save a human life
2011-12-16T01:42:21  <matthewd> antimatroid: No expense is too much... inconvenience, on the other hand.. :)
2011-12-16T01:42:48  <antimatroid> inconvenience is an expense in this context :P
2011-12-16T01:43:50  <pairofdice> What are you saying? Nobody should drive anywhere?
2011-12-16T01:44:08  <pairofdice> Because that would be a bit naive
2011-12-16T01:44:54  <pairofdice> People aren't going to stop living because they're afraid of death
2011-12-16T01:45:48  <antimatroid> i'm not saying that

2011-12-16T01:45:56  <antimatroid> i'm just saying society does place prices on peoples lives
2011-12-16T01:46:00  <antimatroid> maybe not explicity, but it does
2011-12-16T01:46:19  <pairofdice> Sure, you have to weigh riskis
2011-12-16T01:46:20  <antimatroid> it's just my response to people who say something like above, i'm not proposing we stop driving
2011-12-16T01:47:07  <pairofdice> Anyway, the Google car seems to be pretty safe
2011-12-16T01:47:16  <pairofdice> I wonder how it handles winter
2011-12-16T01:47:33  <ChrisH_> @later tell janzert The combination of the scheduling baglog clumping games for players and the 24 hour time frame of the game limits seem to be resonating with each other. Take a look at http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=77. That bot gets a batch of 12 games every 12 hours and then nothing for another 12 hours.
2011-12-16T01:47:33  <contestbot> ChrisH_: Yes master!
2011-12-16T01:48:17  <janzert> ChisH_: see discussion with Scryer earlier ;)
2011-12-16T01:48:52  <ChrisH_> ok

2011-12-16T04:13:43  <BenJackson> you know what's more fun?  watching a bunch of games your bot wins
2011-12-16T04:13:48  <BenJackson> rather than poring over all the defeats

2011-12-16T04:16:12  <BenJackson> you gather food by standing next to it
2011-12-16T04:16:20  <BenJackson> so one of your ants didn't move ("move blocked")

2011-12-16T09:17:57  <UncleVasya> hahah
2011-12-16T09:18:01  <UncleVasya> my bad
2011-12-16T09:18:08  <Antimony> My bot has won 5 games in a row, and it's still not in the top 1000. What the heck?
2011-12-16T09:18:53  <UncleVasya> I was sure you are still alive vecause you upload bot frequently. I was wrong.
2011-12-16T09:18:53  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i read a brief tutorial on ocaml
2011-12-16T09:19:03  <UncleVasya> why?
2011-12-16T09:19:23  <mcstar> why what?
2011-12-16T09:19:25  <mcstar> :D
2011-12-16T09:19:30  <mcstar> shouldnt i?
2011-12-16T09:19:46  <mcstar> i was looking around for functional languages
2011-12-16T09:19:47  <UncleVasya> what was your motivation?
2011-12-16T09:19:54  *** g0llum <g0llum!~g0llum@89.204.153.211> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-16T09:19:55  <mcstar> and ocaml had a nice reputation speed wise
2011-12-16T09:19:55  <UncleVasya> just like me :)
2011-12-16T09:20:08  <mcstar> but it turned out im not gonna like it

2011-12-16T09:20:52  <UncleVasya> One guy from my country who writes in Pascal overpowered me :(
2011-12-16T09:21:01  <mcstar> i decided i should search for "why xyz language sucks" instead why does it rock
2011-12-16T09:21:50  <UncleVasya> There is an article 'Why OCaml language sucks'.
2011-12-16T09:22:43  <mcstar> do you have some secret weapon for the finals?
2011-12-16T09:22:47  <antimatroid> do people randomise the order of directions in which they search?
2011-12-16T09:23:02  <mcstar> antimatroid: i go straight to the fridge
2011-12-16T09:24:01  <Fluxid> so, xfire is probably the next challenge?

2011-12-16T09:27:07  <Migi32> school's over now, exams aren't until another 3 weeks
2011-12-16T09:27:10  <Migi32> let's do this :P

2011-12-16T09:27:24  <mcstar> another wannabe....
2011-12-16T09:27:24  <UncleVasya> mcstar: No, I don't. I had some ideas for little improvements but I've got an important 2 weeks in study-place. What's the name of the week when you get your main marks for the whole semestr?
2011-12-16T09:27:58  <rwest> UncleVasya: hell week
2011-12-16T09:28:04  <mcstar> rwest: hey
2011-12-16T09:28:09  <mcstar> have you seen my message?
2011-12-16T09:28:10  <UncleVasya> yeahhh
2011-12-16T09:28:47  <mcstar> UncleVasya:
2011-12-16T09:28:53  <mcstar> accidental enter
2011-12-16T09:28:56  <rwest> mcstar: no, it was probably sent to rwest_
2011-12-16T09:29:00  <mcstar> yep
2011-12-16T09:29:02  <rwest> I am at work now heh
2011-12-16T09:29:17  <mcstar> i wrote a haskell program that solves your problem
2011-12-16T09:29:25  <mcstar> unfortunately it generates a lot of lists
2011-12-16T09:29:39  <rwest> it solves the 48x10 in under a minute?
2011-12-16T09:29:46  <mcstar> and combinatorial explosion forbids it from giving a number for the problem size
2011-12-16T09:29:49  <mcstar> no
2011-12-16T09:29:56  <mcstar> but solves instantly the previous one
2011-12-16T09:30:05  <rwest> my solution does too
2011-12-16T09:30:06  <rwest> heh
2011-12-16T09:30:16  <mcstar> yeah, its not useful
2011-12-16T09:30:23  <rwest> but I can't get 48x3 or higher
2011-12-16T09:30:36  <mcstar> i dont know how to solve it wo explicitely generating those lists
2011-12-16T09:31:29  *** bergmark <bergmark!bergmark@nat/ibm/x-xfzvgiqbwdnjouuo> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-16T09:31:43  <rwest> there has to be a way to make the matrix multiplication faster
2011-12-16T09:32:01  <rwest> or some short cut I am missing
2011-12-16T09:32:17  <rwest> especialy since it can be done in 0.1s in C
2011-12-16T09:33:42  <mcstar> i dont use matrices
2011-12-16T09:34:21  <mcstar> i compute the all the possible combinations of 3 and 4.5 for a given length
2011-12-16T09:34:23  <mcstar> -the
2011-12-16T09:34:42  <mcstar> after that i sum of those lists like this:
2011-12-16T09:35:00  <mcstar> [3,3,4.5,3] -> [3,6,10.5,13.5]
2011-12-16T09:35:05  <mcstar> drop the last element
2011-12-16T09:35:13  <mcstar> these are the basis lists
2011-12-16T09:35:46  <mcstar> you can put such lists on top of each other as long as their pair-wise itnersection is the empty set
2011-12-16T09:36:10  <rwest> I do the same thing
2011-12-16T09:36:12  <mcstar> so i get a graph, that describes that i can go from ilst A to B
2011-12-16T09:36:19  <rwest> yea
2011-12-16T09:36:23  <rwest> my matrix is your graph
2011-12-16T09:36:23  <mcstar> and count...
2011-12-16T09:36:41  <mcstar> now the problem is with the first step
2011-12-16T09:36:44  <rwest> it's an "incidence matrix"
2011-12-16T09:36:53  <mcstar> it takes too long to generate those lists
2011-12-16T09:37:01  <rwest> yes, that is why I use the matrix
2011-12-16T09:37:02  <rwest> lol
2011-12-16T09:37:10  <rwest> I had a graph at first
2011-12-16T09:37:22  <rwest> but needed something faster, looked around and found the matrix
2011-12-16T09:37:31  <Fluxid> antimatroid: what problem? there is nothing to do?
2011-12-16T09:37:43  <Fluxid> own hill, few own ants, water and no enemy?
2011-12-16T09:38:12  <antimatroid> Fluxid: move an ant in line over so the stuck ant can continue moving outwards
2011-12-16T09:38:33  <antimatroid> suppose the a's are going to go left again for their target
2011-12-16T09:38:39  <antimatroid> and you have a ridiculously large hive
2011-12-16T09:38:47  <Fluxid> ok, so the one outstanding ant want to go in line
2011-12-16T09:38:53  <antimatroid> yes
2011-12-16T09:38:57  <antimatroid> there could be more
2011-12-16T09:39:02  <antimatroid> this is just to highlight it
2011-12-16T09:39:04  <Fluxid> i didn't think of it, it depends on how high priority that ant has
2011-12-16T09:39:26  <Fluxid> i sort move orders by priority/confidence/weight and to them in that order
2011-12-16T09:39:28  <antimatroid> but the "optimal" thing to do would be to move the line over for one a
2011-12-16T09:39:43  <antimatroid> but i don't really know how to tell my bot that
2011-12-16T09:39:47  <Fluxid> so if that one ant really-really needs to go somewhere, it'll go first
2011-12-16T09:40:00  <Fluxid> if it has lower weight, it will wait until it has a chance to move
2011-12-16T09:40:06  <antimatroid> well, either ant can get the target first
2011-12-16T09:40:17  <antimatroid> my problem is how do you make sure both ants can get out from the hill in minimal time
2011-12-16T09:40:28  <Fluxid> i don't make sure
2011-12-16T09:40:39  <antimatroid> i wonder if anyone does
2011-12-16T09:40:49  <mcstar> no
2011-12-16T09:40:55  <mcstar> thats micro optimization
2011-12-16T09:41:02  <mcstar> anyway ants are interchangeable
2011-12-16T09:41:07  <Fluxid> yeah, my bot has much worse issues
2011-12-16T09:41:28  <antimatroid> well i noticed my bot had pile up issues when i tried to make it streamline the ants out better
2011-12-16T09:41:37  <antimatroid> i'm going to try and resolve what they do at the other end i think
2011-12-16T09:41:49  <Fluxid> i think one ant would go to right, and the waiting one take it's place
2011-12-16T09:42:13  <Fluxid> just because even if all ants have the same confidence in reaching a goal, there is slight randomness involved
2011-12-16T09:42:30  <Fluxid> so at some time waiting ant gets higher weight and gets in line
2011-12-16T09:43:20  <Fluxid> oooor, because ants try to go "around" themselves
2011-12-16T09:44:06  <Fluxid> waiting ant adds weight to heightmap, so ants going from north may go more to east eventually
2011-12-16T09:44:20  <Fluxid> line would spread to sides
2011-12-16T09:44:22  <Fluxid> ;P
2011-12-16T09:51:47  <bob_> seeing as though it always takes 24-36hours for ranking and skill of a new bot to converge, should I only submit an update at a minimum of 36hours ahead of the Sunday deadline?
2011-12-16T09:52:40  <rwest> bob_: pretty sure ranking is reset before final contest is run
2011-12-16T09:55:51  <bob_> OK - thanks. maybe I'll carry on after tonight then :)
2011-12-16T09:57:47  <Antimony> ug, my skill is going up so slowly because every game has 2 or 3 opponents
2011-12-16T09:58:35  <pairofdice> O_o
2011-12-16T10:00:55  <Antimony> My bot has won it's first 6 games but it still only rank 825
2011-12-16T10:02:52  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=251446 whoa, the hell
2011-12-16T10:02:56  <Fluxid> that graph
2011-12-16T10:04:37  <mcstar> a bit suicidal
2011-12-16T10:05:51  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=250469&user=13978 oh, burger shows nice behaviour
2011-12-16T10:05:58  * Fluxid is game-walking
2011-12-16T10:06:38  <mcstar> why?
2011-12-16T10:06:44  <mcstar> he is expanding too slowly
2011-12-16T10:07:06  <Fluxid> more like, interesting
2011-12-16T10:07:06  <mcstar> and that kind of "repulsive" thing appeared very early in the contest

2011-12-16T10:18:00  <stocha> so people have the week end to build a bot if they want to
2011-12-16T10:18:01  <rwest> its EST

2011-12-16T10:18:29  <stocha> I wonder if i should try to hack a bot.
2011-12-16T10:18:30  <rwest> so 18:59 UTC?
2011-12-16T10:18:36  <stocha> maybe i'll ask permission to my wife :p

2011-12-16T10:20:53  <stocha> it became strategic in the end. i wish i had a free month to play with the new rules :p

2011-12-16T10:20:58  <mcstar> they arent in ar2

2011-12-16T10:23:57  <antimatroid> that's how i roll :P
2011-12-16T10:24:29  <stocha> if i can find 20 hours or so this week end i'll try to hack up something to submit :p
2011-12-16T10:24:35  <Fluxid> 16:17:28 < stocha> when does it start ?
2011-12-16T10:24:45  <Fluxid> IT'S IN TOPIC
2011-12-16T10:24:49  <UncleVasya> stocha: It was somewhere between 22 and 28 when I submitted new version few days ago. The New version is way stronger but now got only 51st place (althought 33 games already played ).
2011-12-16T10:24:52  <stocha> in any event, i'll be happy to look at all the post contest chatting :)
2011-12-16T10:25:01  <pairofdice> Also on the frontpage
2011-12-16T10:25:08  <stocha> UncleVasya: nice.
2011-12-16T10:25:17  <pairofdice> I want a Java bot to dissect
2011-12-16T10:25:46  <stocha> pairofdice: ideas will be more interesting than code. Unless a lot of optimizing was needed.
2011-12-16T10:25:52  <UncleVasya> I think it is because I optimized new version too hard to fight well old one (I can test my bot only locally).
2011-12-16T10:26:03  <pairofdice> I'm only interested in the code

2011-12-16T10:41:15  <mcstar> Samvara: where are you using exponential functions if i may ask?
2011-12-16T10:41:41  <Surya> Fluxid : You should make a list of best games available somewhere :]

2011-12-16T10:44:35  <rwest> depending how you wanna look at it heh
2011-12-16T10:45:00  <Fluxid> my guess is searching for meaningful bots under skill of 50 is meaningless
2011-12-16T10:45:17  <Surya> :>
2011-12-16T10:45:22  <rwest> so my bot is timing out on any tcp game hmm
2011-12-16T10:46:01  <Surya> It's a shame we can't just throw away starter pack bots. I would love to know how many people actually tried to implement something.
2011-12-16T10:46:13  <mcstar> much less
2011-12-16T10:46:27  <mcstar> i suspect 2-3k
2011-12-16T10:46:46  <mcstar> i guess we will know when finals start
2011-12-16T10:46:54  <rwest> oh haha, sending invalid text = timeout
2011-12-16T10:46:56  <rwest> whoops
2011-12-16T10:46:59  <mcstar> i hope they wont upload starters there
2011-12-16T10:47:06  <Fluxid> there are bots that do something like trying to gather food but are mixed with starters
2011-12-16T10:47:36  <rwest> I like the bots that get a second ant
2011-12-16T10:47:39  <Fluxid> mcstar: uh, upload where?
2011-12-16T10:47:40  <rwest> then crash them together
2011-12-16T10:47:58  <Fluxid> aren't submitted "just going" to finals?
2011-12-16T10:48:01  <mcstar> Fluxid: all the bots that are now uploaded will play int he finals?

2011-12-16T10:48:31  <mcstar> thats a waste of some resources
2011-12-16T10:48:40  <Fluxid> because how do you determine which bot go to finals?
2011-12-16T10:48:52  <Fluxid> top 300?
2011-12-16T10:48:55  <mcstar> no

2011-12-16T10:49:07  <mcstar> or activate or whatever

2011-12-16T11:00:40  <Surya> pairofdice, "The lowest mu bots will be cut incrementally" Do you have more precise infos? I wish my 250~ ranked bot will play some games before getting kicked!
2011-12-16T11:01:02  <pairofdice> No, I don't
2011-12-16T11:01:15  <pairofdice> It's what Janzert said
2011-12-16T11:01:19  <Fluxid> Surya: on the first game you fail you're kicked!
2011-12-16T11:01:20  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-12-16T11:01:43  <Surya> Fluxid: I hope it won't be against xathis and cie
2011-12-16T11:01:48  <Surya> :]
2011-12-16T11:01:48  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-12-16T11:02:05  <Surya> I hope they will release their code, especially this Xathis
2011-12-16T11:02:17  <Fluxid> this is boring, i could binary search instead of going from last page
2011-12-16T11:04:21  <rwest> first game: stuck between xathis and pguillory
2011-12-16T11:04:22  <rwest> gg
2011-12-16T11:05:10  <Fluxid> crossfired and gangbanged?
2011-12-16T11:05:50  <rwest> sounds about right
2011-12-16T11:06:25  <rwest> I hate when you get stuck between strong bots that fight over your hill kill you and take off in different directions
2011-12-16T11:06:46  <mcstar> you are just a fly to them
2011-12-16T11:07:05  <rwest> pretty much
2011-12-16T11:07:24  <antimatroid> swat!
2011-12-16T11:07:40  <mcstar> halleluja, my new bot has improved on my older one
2011-12-16T11:08:04  <rwest> my new bot beats my old one, but can't beat 3 of my old one
2011-12-16T11:08:12  <mcstar> it beats 5 of them
2011-12-16T11:08:21  <rwest> something about how my old bot just suicides into the hill
2011-12-16T11:08:32  <rwest> so when 3 bots suicide on you
2011-12-16T11:08:34  <rwest> - lose

2011-12-16T11:19:58  <UncleVasya> For there is already talks about picking next game what do you guys think about something like Worms?
2011-12-16T11:20:18  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: would be sweet, but dunno how the mechanics would work
2011-12-16T11:20:19  <rwest> Fluxid: that shit like freezes my chrome tab haha

2011-12-16T11:20:26  <rwest> there it goes
2011-12-16T11:20:36  <UncleVasya> If you don't know what the Wormsis you can check thir oss clone: Warmux.
2011-12-16T11:20:39  <antimatroid> but that's merely my opinion
2011-12-16T11:21:09  <antimatroid> we could base it off the open source worms for linux?
2011-12-16T11:21:59  <Fluxid> rwest: works great under Opera here
2011-12-16T11:22:42  <mcstar> something real time with over a continuous space woudl be sweet
2011-12-16T11:23:12  <rwest> Fluxid: I had to close and reopen the tab, dunno what happened
2011-12-16T11:23:31  <Fluxid> >Chrome
2011-12-16T11:23:37  <Fluxid> that happened :)
2011-12-16T11:29:41  <mcstar> so at this point the contest organizers need to decide in which direction to move forward: more formal, studied games with possible optimal solutions, or more life-like games where only heuristics is applicable
2011-12-16T11:29:55  <mcstar> because i think Ants is inbetween this two worlds
2011-12-16T11:29:57  <pairofdice> They don't want optimal solutions
2011-12-16T11:30:11  <mcstar> these*
2011-12-16T11:31:42  <antimatroid> strict requirements are it being simple enough for beginners
2011-12-16T11:31:57  <antimatroid> my personal next requirements are that it has enough depth to be competitive at to thetop
2011-12-16T11:32:21  <mcstar> yeah, we had enough simple games :)
2011-12-16T11:34:44  <pairofdice> Well you could take a vote on what features you want it to have. Observability, Stochasticity, discrete/continuous, number of agents ...
2011-12-16T11:35:25  <mcstar> how about mortal combat fighters? :D
2011-12-16T11:35:52  <pairofdice> continue;
2011-12-16T11:35:53  <pairofdice> :D
2011-12-16T11:39:46  * antimatroid is against stochastic game mechanics
2011-12-16T11:39:55  <antimatroid> i don't mind like how food spawning is picked
2011-12-16T11:40:07  <antimatroid> but i despise the random ant spawn rule
2011-12-16T11:40:15  <antimatroid> and would hate random battle resolution etc.
2011-12-16T11:40:49  <mcstar> the battle resolution is remarkable in this game
2011-12-16T11:41:00  <antimatroid> remarkably awesome?
2011-12-16T11:41:12  <mcstar> it is very good
2011-12-16T11:41:33  <pairofdice> randomness is good
2011-12-16T11:41:33  <mcstar> i dont know how did mcleo come up with it, or whoever
2011-12-16T11:41:41  <antimatroid> jmcarthur i think
2011-12-16T11:41:58  <mcstar> i dont want randomness in the battle res
2011-12-16T11:42:19  <mcstar> maybe in a more real-world like space a little bit of it is acceptable
2011-12-16T11:42:31  <mcstar> but on a low-res space like ants, it would suck
2011-12-16T11:45:21  <antimatroid> what about connect k in an mxn grid?
2011-12-16T11:45:30  <antimatroid> is that solved?
2011-12-16T11:46:14  <mcstar> dunno
2011-12-16T11:46:20  <mcstar> but i dont want that for the next comp.
2011-12-16T11:46:25  <pairofdice> me neither
2011-12-16T11:46:31  <mcstar> its too...dry
2011-12-16T11:46:33  <mcstar> or something
2011-12-16T11:46:36  <pairofdice> Not sexy at all
2011-12-16T11:46:42  <mcstar> not at all :D
2011-12-16T11:47:05  <antimatroid> mario kart would be awesome, but i don't see how

2011-12-16T11:49:52  <antimatroid> i'm starting to hope for top 10
2011-12-16T11:49:58  <antimatroid> but i doubt i'll be able to touch you guys
2011-12-16T11:51:15  <xathis> antimatroid: what's your name on the officiel server?
2011-12-16T11:51:22  <antimatroid> antimatroid
2011-12-16T11:51:25  <antimatroid> haven't uploaded yet
2011-12-16T11:51:29  <xathis> ah okay
2011-12-16T11:51:44  <antimatroid> i'm just going to let it loose in the finals
2011-12-16T11:51:49  <xathis> are you on fluxid tcp?
2011-12-16T11:52:02  <pairofdice> ...Betting starts now...
2011-12-16T11:52:02  <antimatroid> i was, then switched to tcpants cause fluxid seemed to implode
2011-12-16T11:52:24  <antimatroid> http://tcpants.com/player/SkyCaptain
2011-12-16T11:52:32  <antimatroid> i'm trying to make it better still
2011-12-16T11:52:42  <antimatroid> it's fairly stupid how it sends its ants out
2011-12-16T11:54:24  <mcstar> xathis: does java has anything to do with your success, or is it just the language you know the best?
2011-12-16T11:54:35  <Surya> Xathis: Do you plan to release your code after the end of the challenge? I would be really interested in seeing how complex it is.
2011-12-16T11:54:51  <xathis> mcstar: it's the language i know best
2011-12-16T11:55:32  <xathis> Surya: yes, i will write about my bot and release the code
2011-12-16T11:55:39  <pairofdice> Awesome
2011-12-16T11:55:49  <mcstar> oh
2011-12-16T11:55:52  <Surya> That's really nice of you, Hope you'll win ;)
2011-12-16T11:55:57  <mcstar> so after all it isnt self-aware??
2011-12-16T11:56:16  <amstan> oh man.. xathis is way ahead
2011-12-16T11:56:45  <amstan> i assume flag is resubmitting
2011-12-16T11:56:53  <xathis> antimatroid: looks pretty good, but i noticed the sending-out-in-one-direction-only as well
2011-12-16T11:57:25  <antimatroid> xathis: sending-out-in-one-direction?
2011-12-16T11:57:39  <a1k0n> a lot of people are resubmitting a lot
2011-12-16T11:57:43  <a1k0n> hence i'm in 3rd
2011-12-16T11:57:48  <xathis> antimatroid: your bot sends the ants away from the hill strangely
2011-12-16T11:57:52  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-16T11:57:56  <antimatroid> i'm trying to fix that atm
2011-12-16T11:58:06  <antimatroid> it's because it is trying to pathfind not over ants
2011-12-16T11:58:19  <antimatroid> i'm trying to get the desired affect without doing that
2011-12-16T11:58:42  <antimatroid> and in the process better streamlining the ants out from the hills
2011-12-16T11:59:02  <antimatroid> then i'ma work on my combat a bit more, it might be a little too offensive atm
2011-12-16T11:59:08  <antimatroid> then i'ma submit :)
2011-12-16T11:59:15  <a1k0n> wait what?  you're actually showing your bot?
2011-12-16T11:59:32  <antimatroid> a1k0n: http://tcpants.com/player/SkyCaptain

2011-12-16T12:06:32  <xathis> my bot really needs a high turn limit, i just  won a game in which i had 3 pts while delineate had 11 pts at turn 350.
2011-12-16T12:07:03  <antimatroid> yeah my bot doesn't seem amazing when there's lots of hills up for grabs at the start

2011-12-16T12:24:35  <besh> yes bots strength change, new bots get submitted but with the same conditon you can get very different results if you dont take enough samples.
2011-12-16T12:24:45  <a1k0n> 3 points is pretty different though
2011-12-16T12:25:13  <mcstar> in the finals there wont be re-submissions
2011-12-16T12:25:17  <mcstar> so its moot
2011-12-16T12:25:29  <a1k0n> well yeah, but anyway it still takes something like 100 games for it to really stabilize, i've noticed
2011-12-16T12:25:44  <a1k0n> since trueskill just updates once after each game
2011-12-16T12:25:56  <mcstar> even if trueskill isnt perfect, you have to attack a number to a bot somehow
2011-12-16T12:26:05  <a1k0n> as opposed to a whole-history reranking kind of thing like bayeselo
2011-12-16T12:26:06  <mcstar> what matters is that at least the top be correct

2011-12-16T13:06:59  <dmj111> one down
2011-12-16T13:07:01  <dmj111> gosh
2011-12-16T13:07:02  <mcstar> seems google employees werent interested in this contest except you
2011-12-16T13:07:12  <a1k0n> xathis: still pretty young then :)
2011-12-16T13:07:22  <dmj111> xathis: yes, nice work!
2011-12-16T13:07:34  <xathis> a1k0n, dmj111: thanks
2011-12-16T13:08:08  <Murashka> UncleVasya :)
2011-12-16T13:09:18  <a1k0n> we have google offices in hamburg, hint hint
2011-12-16T13:09:42  <BenJackson> a1k0n: hey, he's the one winning
2011-12-16T13:09:56  <BenJackson> I think google only gets to recruit contestants that finish below the top google finisher
2011-12-16T13:10:02  <a1k0n> oh ok
2011-12-16T13:10:03  <BenJackson> xathis can recruit you
2011-12-16T13:10:44  <UncleVasya> Murashka: btw, my friend has very big imagination and decided your nick is a ukranian trolling for russians: my Rashka. I said no way he's right. :)
2011-12-16T13:10:47  <mcstar> since there are many professionals here, what do you think the lowes ranking is that you would put in your resume?
2011-12-16T13:10:56  <mcstar> thats an important question for me
2011-12-16T13:11:12  <BenJackson> mcstar: hard to answer.  only contestants really know what the ranks mean
2011-12-16T13:11:22  <a1k0n> mcstar: the ranking doesn't matter as much as being able to put together a good description of your bot
2011-12-16T13:11:37  <mcstar> what do you mean by that?
2011-12-16T13:11:40  <BenJackson> yeah, I'd say it's good fodder as an answer to lots of interview questions
2011-12-16T13:11:45  <BenJackson> tell me about a difficult problem you debugged
2011-12-16T13:11:48  <a1k0n> plus there's like 7000 entries so any working bot looks good ranking-wise
2011-12-16T13:11:55  <BenJackson> tell me about a program that had a performance problem that you resolved
2011-12-16T13:11:57  <UncleVasya> a1k0n: so can ypu please upload some of your earlier version so we can find a job in Google
2011-12-16T13:12:25  <a1k0n> i'll refer all of you, and then if any of you get hired i get a referral bonus
2011-12-16T13:12:42  <BenJackson> I'd say participating (beyond uploading a starter kit) is an attribute I would find encouraging in a candidate
2011-12-16T13:12:48  <a1k0n> (if bmh doesn't do it first)
2011-12-16T13:12:56  <Murashka> UncleVasya no trolling, just funny name
2011-12-16T13:13:01  <BenJackson> if you are in the top 20 I'll throw out my other questions and we'll talk bot strategy :)
2011-12-16T13:13:17  <mcstar> that probably wont happen
2011-12-16T13:13:36  <mcstar> there are only 20 people who will get into top 20
2011-12-16T13:13:37  <dmj111> the few times I have been an interviewer, enthusiasm for learning new things was high on my list of qualities of the inteviewee.
2011-12-16T13:13:41  <UncleVasya> And after some amound of hiring company will fire you because there is so many another talented guys here! :p

2011-12-16T13:15:11  <a1k0n> especially in silicon valley
2011-12-16T13:15:25  <BenJackson> I've certainly interviewed guys who I doubt would be able to get into the top 1000
2011-12-16T13:16:23  <mcstar> i hope you didnt hire them
2011-12-16T13:16:26  <mcstar> no offense
2011-12-16T13:16:34  <BenJackson> I hope I didn't too!

2011-12-16T13:18:24  <mcstar> im very disappointed that there are <20 hungarians
2011-12-16T13:18:42  <a1k0n> yeah, too bad no mega1
2011-12-16T13:19:18  <mcstar> somehow the news of his winning didnt reach the university hostels
2011-12-16T13:19:21  <Murashka> it's probably because popular social network habrahabr talk about it very much
2011-12-16T13:19:33  <UncleVasya> Murashka: Yeah... but he writes in C++ so this is acceptable. No shame in losing to C++ bot.
2011-12-16T13:20:12  <a1k0n> it's a social network?  looks more like.. slashdot
2011-12-16T13:20:18  <mcstar> UncleVasya: obviously you had some good ideas, your ranking is really nice wrt your language of choice

2011-12-16T13:21:36  <UncleVasya> Murashka: Will you upload one more version?
2011-12-16T13:22:11  <praveen_> any chance of extending it by one more week?

2011-12-16T13:24:15  <UncleVasya> Murashka: I have no arguments agains Pascal itself. Itis just its reputation of language for schoolchildren and junior students. So when I see your bot the first thing that come in mind is 'hell, some yang man doing better than you!'
2011-12-16T13:24:29  <praveen_> yeah thats ok, am extremely happy with the learning I got here. sad that its going to end :(
2011-12-16T13:26:05  <pairofdice> Third from Finland, what the hell. This makes me sad.
2011-12-16T13:26:11  <UncleVasya> Really, I understand that pascal is used by professional too sometimes so no offence. Just a stereotipe
2011-12-16T13:26:19  <a1k0n> hasn't everybody moved from pascal to delphi?
2011-12-16T13:26:21  <Murashka> UncleVasya I'm far from young unfortunately :) Delphi just more comfortable for me.
2011-12-16T13:26:53  <a1k0n> pairofdice: i would expect finland to do well.  don't you all write demos every weekend?
2011-12-16T13:27:19  <pairofdice> Yeah, sure. But I'm not a programmer .
2011-12-16T13:27:27  <UncleVasya> Murashka: btw, I've started my bot with Delphi previous challenge. It just wasn't supported so I moved to C++.
2011-12-16T13:27:48  <a1k0n> you've done an awful lot of python programming for not being a programmer
2011-12-16T13:27:50  <pairofdice> So the level of finnish programming where I'm third is a bit crazy
2011-12-16T13:28:05  <UncleVasya> wasn't supported by contest I mean
2011-12-16T13:28:07  <a1k0n> oh.  i see.
2011-12-16T13:28:09  <pairofdice> The only thing I did before this challenge was some POroject euler problems

2011-12-16T13:48:46  <UncleVasya> Be careful Murashka, there is a tendention for middle-aged contestants: they get troubles with wife who doesn't let them to compete one more time.
2011-12-16T13:50:26  <Murashka> UncleVasya of course you understand that wife it's more important than any competition?:)

2011-12-16T14:25:55  <BenJackson> I've noticed that when I "read new" I don't pay attention to where things are posted
2011-12-16T14:26:01  <BenJackson> but when I post it never seems obvious where to go
2011-12-16T14:27:44  <BenJackson> GreedyBot is at 2997.  Is the tutorial bot better than greedy?
2011-12-16T14:28:01  <BenJackson> is there a submission that is the tutorial result?
2011-12-16T14:28:20  <janzert> I don't necessarily agree with the way it is currently organized, but I also don't have the time or motivation to work on changing it.
2011-12-16T14:28:43  <janzert> not sure, I thought the result of the tutorial was a bot that timed out all the time :/
2011-12-16T14:29:27  <janzert> since it uses an extremely inefficient exploration algorithm
2011-12-16T14:29:42  <BenJackson> I was just wondering if there was an easy way to draw a line in the results to say who had put in effort beyond the tutorial

2011-12-16T15:00:46  <thestinger> or sleep(2)
2011-12-16T15:00:53  <thestinger> but it's a valid theory
2011-12-16T15:00:58  <rwest> somebody is taking like 30s to load their bot right now I swear
2011-12-16T15:01:11  <rwest> at least the turns are instant now
2011-12-16T15:01:46  <rwest> well my combat is better, but not where it would be if I had more time :-/

2011-12-16T15:04:01  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=251587&user=2255 yay for timeouts
2011-12-16T15:05:58  <BenJackson> wow
2011-12-16T15:06:11  <Fluxid> WOW
2011-12-16T15:06:11  <BenJackson> who did you pay off to get ChrisH *and* pguillory to time out against you
2011-12-16T15:06:15  <Fluxid> best timeout ever!
2011-12-16T15:06:36  <Fluxid> pguillory timeouted right by two hills
2011-12-16T15:06:39  <Fluxid> awesome
2011-12-16T15:06:53  <thestinger> my bot has magic voodoo powers
2011-12-16T15:07:20  <olexs> hm... I really need to stop being lazy and implement detection of timed-out bots, if even top-10 guys time out occasionally
2011-12-16T15:07:50  <BenJackson> I think you will find that the technology has applications even against non-timed-out bots
2011-12-16T15:08:04  <BenJackson> after all, is there really a difference between a bot that's not moving and a timed out bot?
2011-12-16T15:08:07  <olexs> true
2011-12-16T15:08:46  <Fluxid> well, at least you don't need to predict movements of dead bot once you know he'll not move
2011-12-16T15:09:07  <thestinger> I need to merge working defense and combat scoring today
2011-12-16T15:09:10  <olexs> Fluxid: that's the point, once my combat system knows an ant won't move it'll make short work of him
2011-12-16T15:10:26  <Fluxid> hm, Hammerok seems to hit time limit too, started to choke at some point
2011-12-16T15:10:28  <thestinger> so I need to teach my bot to play dead?
2011-12-16T15:11:00  <thestinger> if (fighting_a_good_bot) { play_dead(); }
2011-12-16T15:11:22  <mcstar> i train on that map a lot
2011-12-16T15:11:46  <mcstar> pgulroy does what i want my bot to do
2011-12-16T15:11:50  <mcstar> what a coincidence
2011-12-16T15:12:51  <mcstar> olexs: do i remember correctly that you are writing your bot as part of your thesis?

2011-12-16T15:15:01  <olexs> it seems like I lack the crucial know-how to get well into the top100 at the moment, the last version hovered about the 100 mark, the current one should be a bit better I think

2011-12-16T16:41:13  <Scryer> If I had wheels I'd be a roller coaster.
2011-12-16T16:41:18  <thestinger> BenJackson: I don't think bitbucket runs any of the commands that would cause it to run automatically
2011-12-16T16:41:21  <TL_> http://tcpants.com/replay.2156 nice game here. saved by turn limit from strcat. :)
2011-12-16T16:42:19  <thestinger> BenJackson: oh, I guess it should be run by git-receive-pack...
2011-12-16T16:42:50  <janzert> bleh, it takes a long time to kick all the workers now :}
2011-12-16T16:45:21  <thestinger> TL_: wow, I had over 500 ants in my hill at the end... that might be something I have to fix
2011-12-16T16:45:23  <Scryer> TL_: looks like GreenTea had a similar near-death experience vs xathis here: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=252397&user=4513
2011-12-16T16:46:10  <thestinger> nvm, I think I was just gathering food too quickly - the hill isn't really ever blocked
2011-12-16T16:46:38  <pairofdice> Yeah, you can only vomit out one ant epr turn
2011-12-16T16:46:50  <pairofdice> per hill
2011-12-16T16:46:52  <olexs> thestinger: that happens a lot on large single-hill maps, if a bot is any good at gathering food
2011-12-16T16:46:53  <Scryer> Need moar hillz!

2011-12-16T16:48:24  <thestinger> I guess that's another thing I need to add, if a hill is completely surrounded there's no point in sending more ants to it
2011-12-16T16:49:02  <TL_> thestinger: you we're busy with that single hill while i take down other hills. :)
2011-12-16T16:49:13  <TL_> were
2011-12-16T16:49:27  <thestinger> yeah, my weighting for hill attacking sucks
2011-12-16T16:49:40  <BenJackson> TL_: Beware tcpants has the wrong turn limit (750 vs 1000)
2011-12-16T16:50:01  <thestinger> red was really close to me, so defense was also kicking in
2011-12-16T16:50:01  <ChrisH_> @later tell BenJackson re: "get a load of this map: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.35878" wow, don't think i've had a game on that one yet, what's the map name?
2011-12-16T16:50:01  <contestbot> ChrisH_: Yes master!
2011-12-16T16:50:23  <ChrisH_> doh, didn't see you there BenJackson
2011-12-16T16:50:34  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I figured you could get it out of fluxid's game list but maybe it's erased now
2011-12-16T16:50:45  <ChrisH_> yeah, it has scrolled past page 9 now
2011-12-16T16:50:50  <tmseiler> tcpants uses a lot of maps that aren't in the official rotation too
2011-12-16T16:51:13  <Scryer> Oh, boy, let's do another one on tutorial.map!
2011-12-16T16:51:13  <ChrisH_> ahh, but changing the url to p10 works...
2011-12-16T16:51:39  <ChrisH_> no, just shows page 0
2011-12-16T16:51:44  <BenJackson> I did lose (or do poorly) in an aichallenge zillion hill map and was wrestling with the idea of adding code like yours
2011-12-16T16:51:47  <olexs> what's with the bots on aichallenge still stuck in "playing a game right now"? the workers seem to be working again, but my bot still does nothing
2011-12-16T16:52:04  <BenJackson> trying to justify the idea that I'd only enable it if I detected the multi-hill low-food case
2011-12-16T16:52:06  <thestinger> TL_: you destroyed me in our next game :)
2011-12-16T16:52:08  <BenJackson> to reduce risk
2011-12-16T16:52:10  <ChrisH_> I think janzert is messing with the code that does that.
2011-12-16T16:52:33  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: also check out my game list, I played 10 in 15 minutes to get to 63 or something overnight
2011-12-16T16:52:40  <ChrisH_> ok
2011-12-16T16:52:51  <BenJackson> I was quite pleased with the matchup error in my favor
2011-12-16T16:53:12  <ChrisH_> got it:  maze_p08_07.map
2011-12-16T16:53:14  <BenJackson> I played 4 games with Speedy_Consoles
2011-12-16T16:53:40  <Scryer> I was wondering whether you could fake out the servers by taking all your time per move, and queue up more games on the other servers who don't realize you're already in a game.  Or doesn't it work that way?
2011-12-16T16:53:48  <BenJackson> at 5:08, 09, 11, 18
2011-12-16T16:54:13  <BenJackson> Scryer: plenty of people just straight up run multiple bots on tcp
2011-12-16T16:54:46  <Scryer> Oh, thought you meant on "live".
2011-12-16T16:54:57  <BenJackson> oh, I did
2011-12-16T16:55:03  <BenJackson> the matchup thing got confused I guess
2011-12-16T16:55:27  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I replied to your forum post about job hunting.  Great post BTW.
2011-12-16T16:56:06  <BenJackson> thanks
2011-12-16T16:56:07  <Scryer> I think I'd set the bar a little higher, though - 2000 is still danged weak.
2011-12-16T16:56:49  <janzert> ok, it's going to take a while to work through the extraneous "playing in game" messages but it should be working itself out now
2011-12-16T16:57:00  <Scryer> Thanks, janzert.
2011-12-16T16:57:21  <ChrisH_> I may (or may not) be job hunting soon, and you better believe I will use my experience in this contest to my advantage.
2011-12-16T16:57:25  <janzert> and by "a while" my best guess is just under 1.5 hours :/

2011-12-16T16:59:49  <ChrisH_> My current employer bragged about my #24 finish in PW on the company FB page.  :)
2011-12-16T17:00:41  <tmseiler> my personal goal is top 100 before this is over, it's like exponential toughness as you climb this ladder
2011-12-16T17:01:29  <ChrisH_> tmseiler: once you get in top 100 you will want top 50.  ;)
2011-12-16T17:02:07  <Dlayne> My current TM wished me luck. He encourages such challenges
2011-12-16T17:02:09  <tmseiler> I know, it's true
2011-12-16T17:02:27  <ChrisH_> Dlayne: that's great!
2011-12-16T17:03:06  <yoden> i was in top 100... then people implemented combat logic
2011-12-16T17:03:07  <yoden> :>
2011-12-16T17:03:36  <tmseiler> I'm adhering as strictly as possible to emergent techniques
2011-12-16T17:03:42  <tmseiler> so combat is really the weakness
2011-12-16T17:03:56  <tmseiler> I'm kind of resigned to that limitation
2011-12-16T17:04:47  <tmseiler> some of these bots handle combat as well as an expert RTS player controlling units manually
2011-12-16T17:05:01  <Scryer> My early versions got to about 250 without ever looking at where enemy ants were.  Then things got tougher.
2011-12-16T17:05:20  <tmseiler> yeah, in fact I noticed blind aggression actually having advantages over those overly cautious guys
2011-12-16T17:05:32  <tmseiler> "right this way, sir"

2011-12-16T17:10:38  <ChrisH_> the competition has definitely gotten a lot stronger since the beginning, there are some bots I remember seeing in the top 20 that are now down around 200
2011-12-16T17:11:43  <tmseiler> I wonder how many had AI backgrounds before entering
2011-12-16T17:12:43  <janzert> ok, after realizing that the time to play out all the extra matches by playing them was going to take closer to 3 hours I've just manually cleared them out now. so in game display should be returning to normal now.
2011-12-16T17:14:22  <thestinger> BenJackson: so, tcpants appears to have died
2011-12-16T17:14:22  <ChrisH_> ZumZoom was #14 on Nov 4th and hasn't resubmitted, now that bot is #215.
2011-12-16T17:14:43  <besh> tcpants website is down again.
2011-12-16T17:14:55  <ikaros> momobot did never resubmit and is still in top 20
2011-12-16T17:15:05  <tmseiler> I think the tcp servers keep the web server portion on extremely low priority or something

2011-12-16T17:20:48  <thestinger> fluxid's server is kind of crazy
2011-12-16T17:20:55  <tmseiler> sometimes I'll clearly win a game as #1, but there will be one tiny fight where I screw up, and I view the game as a wash
2011-12-16T17:21:19  <thestinger> I think the rankings on it are totally screwed up now...

2011-12-16T17:24:45  <besh> This statement from official webpage "Upon completion the contest winner will be announced and all results will be publically available."

2011-12-16T17:25:47  <olexs> besh: I think that means that there will be an official announcement, in addition to just a ranking table where it is now
2011-12-16T17:26:05  <Scryer> janzert says we'll likely see the games as usual: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=2070
2011-12-16T17:26:07  <ChrisH_> besh: also the rankings were continuously updated last time as well
2011-12-16T17:26:17  <besh> Ok thanks guys.
2011-12-16T17:26:38  <janzert> besh: we have in the past not updated the rankings for the last part of finals to leave the final result a bit of a suspense but will probably not do that this time
2011-12-16T17:26:47  <janzert> i.e. the rankings will stay live throughout

2011-12-16T17:52:17  <codetiger> my latest v23 always beats my v19 which is on the aichallenge.org with rank #292 in 29 games. Does that mean I'll make it to 100?
2011-12-16T17:52:20  <Scryer> Grr - I was chugging along at 3-4ms per move on TCPants, and timed out. Fmpph.
2011-12-16T17:53:08  <Scryer> It could be taking advantage of something specific you fixed, codetiger.  It'll probably be better than 292, though.
2011-12-16T17:53:56  <codetiger> my aim is to reach top 100, but that seems to have become too hard now
2011-12-16T17:55:00  <Scryer> I think my only change to get there in 48 hours is to implement brilliant combat tactics.

2011-12-16T17:55:17  <codetiger> at this point of time I feel too bad to see the aichallenge server has only 5 gpm

2011-12-16T17:55:52  <codetiger> use Memetix's combat method. You can implement it in couple of hours
2011-12-16T17:56:14  * Scryer digs out the forum posting again.
2011-12-16T17:56:38  <codetiger> another 2 months will definitly impact my happy family condition

2011-12-16T18:08:02  <codetiger> depends on matchmaking I guess...
2011-12-16T18:08:06  <BenJackson> janzert: what's a while?  I'm still stuck
2011-12-16T18:08:12  <thestinger> it takes ~8 games for me to climb back to the top 100
2011-12-16T18:08:24  <pairofdice> Didn't he say he manually cleared them

2011-12-16T18:11:32  <BenJackson> took 17 to get to #42 this time
2011-12-16T18:11:37  <BenJackson> I got much better matchups
2011-12-16T18:12:01  <BenJackson> my mu might actually be close to correct now
2011-12-16T18:12:02  <thestinger> my current upload took 16 games to get to rank 55
2011-12-16T18:12:05  <BenJackson> still high sigma
2011-12-16T18:12:33  <thestinger> mu is 91.66 which is almost what it got to last time, and I know it's a slight improvement - so it has a bit more to go
2011-12-16T18:13:54  <codetiger> BenJackson: please plz remove bj_v5 from bhickey servers. Its just playing with your v7 always and not letting me to get that oppurtunity
2011-12-16T18:15:26  <Scryer> Where do you see your mu and sigma?

2011-12-16T18:23:58  <BenJackson> codetiger: going beyond V7 is only really V10.  V8, 9 were shortlived and had silly bugs
2011-12-16T18:24:07  <BenJackson> V10 is pretty strong for bmh's server
2011-12-16T18:24:28  <BenJackson> V10 was about 13th overall when it was retired
2011-12-16T18:24:31  <codetiger> but bmh has only 2 users now

2011-12-16T18:25:22  <BenJackson> basically providing a service where you could use "telnet me someport" and I would run an ant remotely

2011-12-16T18:48:42  <codetiger> Fluxid: just tried fluxid.pl and it works. but not ants.fluxid.pl
2011-12-16T18:50:24  <thestinger> I barely have anything left to code and I might finish it all today
2011-12-16T18:50:43  <BenJackson> I am trying to stay rational and not change anything
2011-12-16T18:50:47  <BenJackson> I know of some minor tweaks
2011-12-16T18:50:54  <BenJackson> and I'm inspired by ChrisH's low food/hill work
2011-12-16T18:51:16  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/knPXxGvim0CqTG6hXS4g/ <- that's my todo list
2011-12-16T18:51:16  <rwest_> damn tcpants and the 750 turn limit
2011-12-16T18:51:19  <BenJackson> and I think that even a bad implementation of that might have won the game I just lost
2011-12-16T18:51:28  <thestinger> I basically just have stuff left to merge, but it's not tested enough so I doubt I will
2011-12-16T18:52:40  <BenJackson> If I could reliably detect the "chaos" games

2011-12-16T18:52:52  <BenJackson> eg multi hill, high player count, low food
2011-12-16T18:53:02  <BenJackson> then I'd be tempted to throw in some really dumb "stand on hill" code
2011-12-16T18:53:16  <BenJackson> because I stand a decent chance of losing anyway
2011-12-16T18:53:21  <BenJackson> and it wouldn't affect other maps
2011-12-16T18:59:02  <Scryer> My term for those are "clusterf..." maps, and I don't try to detect them either.
2011-12-16T18:59:23  <BenJackson> Scryer: ChrisH_ seems to have solved them
2011-12-16T19:00:25  <thestinger> I think if I just turn on defense for 1 hill it will fix those a lot, but picking that hill is tricky

2011-12-16T19:08:30  <ChrisH_> it's more than just waiting until I have ants ready to spawn, it also includes chosing where to spawn them to suit my strategy
2011-12-16T19:08:41  <BenJackson> codetiger: you can see it on my profile, it's the version 7 bot
2011-12-16T19:08:50  <codetiger> Now my bot can take it down, if not everytime, atleast most of the time
2011-12-16T19:09:10  <BenJackson> janzert: I didn't measure that game but I do have some constants based on the rules for minimum hill distance
2011-12-16T19:09:15  <BenJackson> and there are maps in the rotation that violate them
2011-12-16T19:10:00  <BenJackson> janzert: I think in that case parapsprites (sp) got off to a good start and I was first on the menu
2011-12-16T19:10:15  <BenJackson> that game was lost when I didn't find closer food and got behind in ant count
2011-12-16T19:10:30  <BenJackson> being a maze the consequences of random decisions are more significant
2011-12-16T19:11:17  <BenJackson> but maybe if I'd focused on one hill or the other I could have kept one
2011-12-16T19:11:44  <BenJackson> if my other one had not ALSO been right next to the same guy it might have worked out that way automatically
2011-12-16T19:12:00  <janzert> I'd say you sent to many ants south east then let a few ants dance around your south hill and combined that put you too far behind to have any chance
2011-12-16T19:12:04  <Scryer> I posted a suggestion about evaluating maps based on how accurately their outcomes match the true-skill of the participants. I'm not a big fan of luck-of-the-draw.
2011-12-16T19:12:25  <janzert> Scryer: that would be interesting to see
2011-12-16T19:12:39  <codetiger> My bot is much better now, on multi hill mazes with very close neighbor. My last version has a bug that solved it
2011-12-16T19:12:57  <janzert> but don't expect it to make it into use for the contest this time
2011-12-16T19:13:13  <Scryer> Heh. We'll start in March for the next contest. :)
2011-12-16T19:13:38  <BenJackson> Scryer: I was thinking along the same lines
2011-12-16T19:13:50  <BenJackson> however that just tends to reward people who are already good
2011-12-16T19:14:05  <janzert> there was talk of doing that for this contest very early on but no one ever actually did it
2011-12-16T19:14:09  <BenJackson> and credit to ChrisH_ for providing a practical example of how someone could actually find advantage in a map that looks liek crap to the rest of us
2011-12-16T19:14:24  <BenJackson> if you screened those maps because xathis wasn't good at them it would just reward xathis
2011-12-16T19:14:50  <janzert> BenJackson: yeah, you'd have to be very careful on what the actual criteria for defining a good map is
2011-12-16T19:15:02  <Scryer> Well, the point is to *find* who the best players are.  Is xathis the best?  Fine.  Could we make the maps random enough to make him lose more?  Probably, but what does that prove?
2011-12-16T19:15:19  <BenJackson> Scryer: but that's just it
2011-12-16T19:15:26  <BenJackson> I would have said multi-hill maps were not good at determining skill
2011-12-16T19:15:35  <BenJackson> it just turns out that the aspect of skill they required hadn't been discovered yet
2011-12-16T19:15:52  <thestinger> if a _lot_ of games are played in the finals, I don't think it will matter
2011-12-16T19:15:54  <BenJackson> you could make maps with 1-wide mazes everywhere
2011-12-16T19:15:59  <BenJackson> it sounds pointless, but maybe there's a strategy there
2011-12-16T19:16:25  <BenJackson> thestinger: ...and that is why I try to ignore my losses
2011-12-16T19:16:31  <thestinger> but I think you really need to do tons and tons of games to eliminate the noise
2011-12-16T19:16:32  <BenJackson> I have not written a "win every game" bot
2011-12-16T19:16:35  <BenJackson> but it will win some
2011-12-16T19:16:37  <Scryer> Ah. So you're suggesting that if it were all the clusterfun maps, ChrisH_ might well end up the winner, so he'd be "best" on that set.  I see your point.  One needs a wide range.
2011-12-16T19:16:37  <BenJackson> and against good players
2011-12-16T19:17:02  <thestinger> Scryer: there are lots of maps were two great players can be screwed over because they started next to each other
2011-12-16T19:17:22  <BenJackson> Scryer: right.  at this poitn I have no doubt that if the finals were all multi-hill that ChrisH would have a shot at #1
2011-12-16T19:17:40  <BenJackson> but there *are* still highly asymmetrical maps
2011-12-16T19:17:41  <thestinger> my bot can beat xathis/pguillory if they had a really bad starting position :)
2011-12-16T19:17:44  <BenJackson> I think you could rule those out
2011-12-16T19:17:48  <Scryer> I can also imagine that somebody optimizes for 4-player maps and is unbeatable at them, but when it comes down to a 50-game finals of 2-player matches he's lost.
2011-12-16T19:17:59  <BenJackson> "when"
2011-12-16T19:18:06  <BenJackson> I don't think that's the plan, is it?
2011-12-16T19:18:14  <janzert> no
2011-12-16T19:18:28  <Scryer> I would expect *some* winnowing of the "go-north" bots.
2011-12-16T19:18:49  <thestinger> if I give my bot a direction bias it does a lot better
2011-12-16T19:18:57  <BenJackson> I'm questioning your 2-player assumption
2011-12-16T19:19:05  <BenJackson> it might winnow to the top N, but still withthe normal map rotation
2011-12-16T19:19:13  <thestinger> and I found that if I randomly change the bias now and then, it's a huge improvement over no bias at all :P
2011-12-16T19:19:34  <Scryer> It was a 2-player hypothesis, not an assumption. :)
2011-12-16T19:19:36  <BenJackson> thestinger: hah.  while I worked hard to make sure I selected influences that distributed my ants evenly
2011-12-16T19:19:53  <BenJackson> my latest bot's main innovation is trying to predict trouble and go there
2011-12-16T19:20:03  <thestinger> like a "danger" scent?
2011-12-16T19:20:08  <thestinger> I've tried stuff like that
2011-12-16T19:20:10  <BenJackson> something like that
2011-12-16T19:20:15  <Scryer> Something more predictive than dead ants? :)
2011-12-16T19:20:21  <thestinger> like if a bot is keeping me out of an area
2011-12-16T19:20:29  <BenJackson> Scryer: as in going to empty areas beause I think an enemy will show up there
2011-12-16T19:20:41  <thestinger> if there's an area I haven't explored by the end of the game, there's probably a really damn good bot there
2011-12-16T19:20:42  <besh> do you use the dead ants infor for that ?
2011-12-16T19:20:45  <BenJackson> if you watch my current version you can see it intercepting ants it can't even see sometimes
2011-12-16T19:20:48  <BenJackson> which is pretty neat
2011-12-16T19:21:00  <thestinger> my bot tries to pick off weak hills and get points, not win the long-term game
2011-12-16T19:21:09  <BenJackson> that's a good idea
2011-12-16T19:21:26  <BenJackson> I try to win the long term game
2011-12-16T19:21:29  <thestinger> if the finals were done with an elimination tournament, I would do terribly :P
2011-12-16T19:21:41  <BenJackson> in fact even moreso now my bot's goal is to stay alive and create a buffer of safety
2011-12-16T19:21:46  <BenJackson> it has almost zero idea of defense now
2011-12-16T19:21:50  <BenJackson> if it has to defend it messed up earlier
2011-12-16T19:22:05  <thestinger> I aimed for doing something like that, but I didn't get it finished
2011-12-16T19:22:07  <BenJackson> if you *see* my hill I messed up
2011-12-16T19:22:10  <thestinger> so I just go for points
2011-12-16T19:22:16  <Scryer> "If you find yourself in a fair fight you've failed the planning phase."
2011-12-16T19:22:26  <BenJackson> that's why I'm proud of that one game
2011-12-16T19:22:27  <janzert> heh, isn't the stated goal purely defense?
2011-12-16T19:22:30  <janzert> ;)
2011-12-16T19:22:37  <BenJackson> where I got tied up, but pushed out and killed everything
2011-12-16T19:24:00  <BenJackson> I have *got* to write down that url
2011-12-16T19:24:11  <Antimony> For some reason, I keep losing, and I can't figure out why
2011-12-16T19:24:20  <Antimony> I don't see any obvious flaws in my bot
2011-12-16T19:24:35  <thestinger> I see lots of huge flaws in my bot but I can't fix them or I ruin it
2011-12-16T19:24:50  <thestinger> it does a lot of risk taking and "all in" stuff
2011-12-16T19:25:11  <thestinger> I have an estimate of the number of enemies and the scores they have
2011-12-16T19:25:24  <BenJackson> cool
2011-12-16T19:25:26  <thestinger> and all I do is try to get the easiest 2 points :P

2011-12-16T19:25:56  <thestinger> controlling territory is beyond the intelligence of my current bot
2011-12-16T19:25:58  <BenJackson> ok time to put that in a bookmark
2011-12-16T19:26:06  <thestinger> yeah, that was a great game
2011-12-16T19:26:13  <thestinger> you didn't even have extra ants in your hill
2011-12-16T19:26:19  <BenJackson> that's a game I totally would have lost in earlier versions

2011-12-16T19:29:28  <thestinger> I really have no idea what is going on in those, even after watching them 20 times
2011-12-16T19:29:46  <BenJackson> my new technique is to try to note the order of hill loses
2011-12-16T19:29:49  <BenJackson> losses
2011-12-16T19:29:50  <thestinger> I can't figure out _why_ my bot does stuff because the enemies are so close that the weight I give to ants near my hills totally changes them
2011-12-16T19:29:55  <BenJackson> so I can focus in the right area
2011-12-16T19:29:57  <BenJackson> without watching 20 times
2011-12-16T19:30:35  <BenJackson> thestinger: I've found I have to be careful with metrics that are "close to my hill" or "close to enemy" and make sure they get some meaningful answer for "close to both"

2011-12-16T19:31:46  <BenJackson> Antimony: along those lines we were discussing my secret symmetry detection the other day
2011-12-16T19:31:53  <BenJackson> McLeopold guessed when I hinted
2011-12-16T19:32:00  <BenJackson> which makes sense because he's sort of responsible
2011-12-16T19:32:06  <thestinger> using the food spawns?
2011-12-16T19:32:08  <BenJackson> yes
2011-12-16T19:32:17  <thestinger> yeah, that's very neat
2011-12-16T19:32:18  <BenJackson> Antimony: the game engine leaks symmetry information in the food spawning
2011-12-16T19:32:28  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-16T19:32:38  <Antimony> I thought about using food for symmetry but I haven't implemented that
2011-12-16T19:32:45  <Antimony> I didn't think it would help enough to be worth it
2011-12-16T19:32:53  <thestinger> I spent most of my time learning C++ well, rather than implementing cool things :P
2011-12-16T19:33:09  <thestinger> I only knew enough C to submit a patch or two to some projects
2011-12-16T19:33:24  <thestinger> never actually coded anything in C (and I hadn't touched C++)
2011-12-16T19:33:38  <Antimony> By the way, is there supposed to be a link in this post? http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2056
2011-12-16T19:33:50  <BenJackson> Antimony: (almost) every set of food you see appear simultaneously is symmetric around the hills
2011-12-16T19:34:12  <BenJackson> so if you see two food you know that the relationship between the food is identical to the relationshipo between two hills
2011-12-16T19:34:23  <BenJackson> and you can pick your hill arbitrarily to be one of them
2011-12-16T19:34:32  <Antimony> only if the 2 food are conjuagates
2011-12-16T19:34:38  <BenJackson> so basically every time you see simultaneous food you discover a possible hill
2011-12-16T19:34:43  <Antimony> there are several things that mess it up, so it'd have to be probablistic
2011-12-16T19:34:46  <BenJackson> my method didn't find water at all
2011-12-16T19:34:49  <BenJackson> like dmj111
2011-12-16T19:35:02  <BenJackson> right, if you generate a possible hill and you can see it's not you skip it
2011-12-16T19:35:09  <BenJackson> and you have to track known dead hills
2011-12-16T19:35:14  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-16T19:35:29  <Antimony> well the brute force method is more likely to give results
2011-12-16T19:35:34  <bugnuts> I have something pretty cool for symmetry detection.  Its very fast and really definitely not worth it.
2011-12-16T19:35:38  <Antimony> you don't even have to see the hills to confirm
2011-12-16T19:36:08  <Antimony> I guess doing probabilistic reasoning would help
2011-12-16T19:36:12  <BenJackson> bugnuts: ditto

2011-12-16T20:05:05  <thestinger> I only used it at the start
2011-12-16T20:05:19  <thestinger> Fluxid told me a better way of doing it early on and I switched to that
2011-12-16T20:05:30  <besh> bfs ?
2011-12-16T20:05:37  <thestinger> similar
2011-12-16T20:05:45  <thestinger> sort of like a BFS from a target, but I make distance maps
2011-12-16T20:05:54  <thestinger> so I know all the true distances and paths to a target for every tile
2011-12-16T20:05:59  <thestinger> but there are lots of hacks and weights now
2011-12-16T20:06:02  <thestinger> so it's not BFS
2011-12-16T20:06:15  <thestinger> and I combine some of the maps
2011-12-16T20:06:21  <thestinger> anyway
2011-12-16T20:06:32  <thestinger> with just the vanilla BFS from a target, it was way faster than A*
2011-12-16T20:06:49  <thestinger> even for 1 ant
2011-12-16T20:07:11  <thestinger> your BFS doesn't have to allocate any memory
2011-12-16T20:07:29  <thestinger> you can statically allocate the distance map (a 1D or 2D array) and use that to avoid revisiting tiles
2011-12-16T20:07:41  <thestinger> and the FIFO queue has a known max size
2011-12-16T20:08:37  <thestinger> Locations are just hardware ints (row * cols + col), so expanding 4 nodes just means sticking 4 ints onto the queue
2011-12-16T20:08:50  <besh> that is interesting. I still do A* since I do only one pass.
2011-12-16T20:08:54  <thestinger> not expensive with a struct either
2011-12-16T20:09:39  <thestinger> A* is a bit easier to tweak than this, because you can use a weighted 2d array to get costs
2011-12-16T20:10:06  <thestinger> but I was able to get really good food searching with this by getting nice spreading behavior to emerge
2011-12-16T20:11:08  <besh> i am afraid my ants are one dimensional most of the time.
2011-12-16T20:11:20  <besh> i go either for attacking or exploring. there is no balance
2011-12-16T20:11:47  <thestinger> my individual ants are pretty narrow minded
2011-12-16T20:11:59  <thestinger> but I start fresh every turn, I don't have assigned roles
2011-12-16T20:12:15  <Samvara> besh: I figure that since you have to walk by the Manhattan distance, might as well calculate in walking steps
2011-12-16T20:13:34  <besh> Samvara: yes that is why i do manahattan. But when attacking a hill f.i the ants start to converge earlier with euclidean better (more flocking)
2011-12-16T20:13:47  <BenJackson> thestinger: my bfs is similar
2011-12-16T20:14:05  <BenJackson> but it's funny that I had put some key ones (like distance to any enemy, any hill, etc) in Bot so they didn't get reallocated
2011-12-16T20:14:14  <BenJackson> then I discovered that it was actually faster to alloc new ones
2011-12-16T20:14:32  <thestinger> what if you just use static local vars?
2011-12-16T20:14:44  <thestinger> I haven't speed tested either so I'm just reallocating most things
2011-12-16T20:14:52  <BenJackson> my grid always allocs
2011-12-16T20:15:10  <BenJackson> I did implement grid.swap() which was actually handy in several places

2011-12-16T20:18:54  <ChrisH_> FWIW, my code is probably simiilar to thestinger, but I actually use Djikstra's algorithm and use node traversal costs to help guide ants away from places that they aren't needed or would have a hard time getting through but since they are just higher cost the ants will still go that way if there are no cheaper alternatives.
2011-12-16T20:20:00  <thestinger> I have a cost of 1 for normal tiles, but I do have different costs

2011-12-16T20:21:14  <besh> ChrisH_: How do you get the frontier combat formation in your bot if you don't mind ?
2011-12-16T20:21:45  <ChrisH_> similar to what thestinger just said
2011-12-16T20:21:57  <ChrisH_> I hope to do a writeup on the forums next week.
2011-12-16T20:22:52  <besh> I do what thestinger does i.e penalize path through tiles with 2 but ants still accumulate on choke points. But yours and pigullary's seem to handle that much better I think.
2011-12-16T20:23:07  <thestinger> ChrisH_: does a wall of your ants basically stop ants behind it from choosing that as a goal?
2011-12-16T20:23:23  <ChrisH_> no
2011-12-16T20:24:05  <ChrisH_> but in the case of battle it will have that type of effect, but it doesn't stop them
2011-12-16T20:24:27  <ChrisH_> it will tend to push my ants toward the flank though, which is good
2011-12-16T20:24:53  <ChrisH_> but if there are walls at the flanks already then that's impossible obviously
2011-12-16T20:25:27  <ChrisH_> so a few ants might stack up behind the front line, which can help strengthen the line, and it also makes other ants even less likely to go that way
2011-12-16T20:26:28  <ChrisH_> but if there is no other choice, then they will just keep piling up, which is why I'm experimenting with some logjam breaking code now
2011-12-16T20:27:41  <besh> It is excellent that you are able to get that formation with this small change. I thought of using influnce maps to send ants where ants are needed most.
2011-12-16T20:28:47  <ChrisH_> but this is where one of the really cool things happens with my spawn control code on multiple hills: if a hill gets surrounded by the enemy and I build a wall they can't get through, my spawn control will interact with the extra cost of going through the wall to prevent more ants from spawning behind the wall and let them go out another hill to do useful stuff, maybe even attack the enemy wall from behind.  :evil grin:
2011-12-16T20:31:22  <besh> I have increased upto +6 and it seems that I still get pile of ants
2011-12-16T20:31:29  <mleise> hi, how is the contest going
2011-12-16T20:31:34  <dmj111> BenJackson: Nice write up.  Not sure I can chime in on much... because my opinion mostly matches yours
2011-12-16T20:31:41  <ChrisH_> you can see that happen in this game:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=248555&user=10
2011-12-16T20:32:49  <besh> I see you leave an ant on the hill.
2011-12-16T20:33:23  <BenJackson> dmj111: thanks
2011-12-16T20:33:53  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: synergies like that are really interesting
2011-12-16T20:34:02  <besh> how do you decide to keep the formation or go for the kill ? My bot is generally adventorous and will break its formation even when being close to its own hill.
2011-12-16T20:34:40  <besh> A few enemy ants pass through and my formation is gone. Do you have weights to adjust behaviour when being close to enemy hill / our own hill ?
2011-12-16T20:34:51  <ChrisH_> yeah, my bot's logic has actually gotten simpler over the last few weeks because I have found more of those synergies and made the code more general purpose and less special cases.
2011-12-16T20:35:47  <ChrisH_> besh: I don't have weights exactly for that, but there are some thresholds related to hill distances that trigger adjustments to behavior
2011-12-16T20:37:31  <ChrisH_> besh: my formations are completely emergent based on how my pathing, target selection, and the enemy behavior interact
2011-12-16T20:37:45  <ChrisH_> I don't try to create any specific fomations
2011-12-16T20:37:48  <BenJackson> my bot got more complex because I think I'm approaching the problem backwards now
2011-12-16T20:38:27  <ChrisH_> i don't look for choke points (which at the beginning of this contest I spent a lot of time thinking about), controlling choke points turns out to be emergent as well
2011-12-16T20:38:51  <ChrisH_> which is surprising, but cool
2011-12-16T20:39:15  <BenJackson> I thought I would need anti-chokepoint avoidance too
2011-12-16T20:39:42  <BenJackson> but in my latest code once I cover a chokepoint the combat code doesn't call for help and the "make sure my base isn't jumped" code ignores that path
2011-12-16T20:39:57  <ChrisH_> huh, i always thought the opposite, try to jam the choke points as a means to defend with less ants
2011-12-16T20:40:01  <besh> Even with the emergent behaviour , you have to guide it somehow to prefer to standoff when being close to your hill. You have f.i a double layered emergent formation at Move 498. My bot would completely break that I think..

2011-12-16T20:54:36  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: yeah, he really outflanked me there and you would expect that to be the end, i'm not sure how i survived either
2011-12-16T20:55:00  <BenJackson> he got you again when he managed to anchor on a bit of water
2011-12-16T20:55:01  <BenJackson> but time ran out
2011-12-16T20:56:53  <ChrisH_> looking at the game a little bit more I think there is an interesting dynamic between pguillory and my bot. we both form very similar battle lines, and when we are next to each other in games you always see a big straight line of our ants between our hills like that.
2011-12-16T20:57:30  <bmh> ChrisH_: Are you counting the portion of the board you control and making your bot more aggressive if you're getting squeezed?
2011-12-16T20:57:44  <ChrisH_> but i've noticed pguillory tends to put less emphasis on food gathering and tries to push as many ants as possible to the perimeter, so he has a few more to flank me, but then I have more in my interior to recover with
2011-12-16T20:57:52  <ChrisH_> bmh: no
2011-12-16T20:58:14  <ChrisH_> i tried things like that in my V6 and it didn't work very well
2011-12-16T20:59:02  <BenJackson> my bot gets more aggressive if it has local numbers, if it's close to taking or losing a hill, and if it has too many total ants
2011-12-16T20:59:10  <ChrisH_> i think i had a larger feeding ground at the time he flanked my first line, but his maneuver had the effect of crippling me to a degree and had the game gone on longer he would have won
2011-12-16T20:59:12  <BenJackson> and also randomly in stalemates

2011-12-16T21:02:26  <BenJackson> hence I'm considering ChrisH_'s idea of standing on hills because even if it's a poor implementation it may work anyway
2011-12-16T21:02:48  <mleise> Today was a strange evening at the pub.
2011-12-16T21:03:05  <BenJackson> I'm really really trying to consider myself finished at this point though
2011-12-16T21:03:19  <BenJackson> worst case is resubmitting any time on sunday or even saturday
2011-12-16T21:03:20  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: one side benefit of standing on hills in the tightly clustered multi-hill maps is that your hills can't get ambushed by a single enemy coming in through the back door
2011-12-16T21:03:25  <BenJackson> yep
2011-12-16T21:03:53  <BenJackson> but even if it works and I place higher I don't think I'll be too excited if it's just because I stole your idea
2011-12-16T21:03:56  <ChrisH_> and once you see them you can spawn some ants to drive him off, assuming there is food to be had
2011-12-16T21:04:18  <ChrisH_> we all steal from each other in the end
2011-12-16T21:04:31  <BenJackson> it'd be funny to time it perfectly so that as their 1 ant sneaks up you are suddenly 2
2011-12-16T21:04:40  <BenJackson> ooh hills should be wormholes for your ants
2011-12-16T21:04:47  <BenJackson> that would be really interesting
2011-12-16T21:05:06  <mleise> yes, let's change the rules now
2011-12-16T21:05:07  <BenJackson> step on your own hill while it's occupied, 1 ant goes back in your hive

2011-12-16T21:28:35  <Samvara> Benjackson: early in my analysis I was sure that more boots on the ground must always be better -- you see more, you have more chance to collect food and probably better odds in a fight. I'm still finding it hard to believe that standing on holes is a good plan.
2011-12-16T21:31:23  <ChrisH_> Samvara: standing on a whole may let you put more boots on the ground faster elsewhere on the map.
2011-12-16T21:31:30  <ChrisH_> s/whole/hole
2011-12-16T21:32:14  <ChrisH_> so more boots is good; more boots in the right place is better
2011-12-16T21:32:24  <Samvara> Yeah, I've noticed that the multi-hole games are getting more common in recent rounds. Check game 254825 (if you haven't already) your fronts get pushed back a bit easily
2011-12-16T21:32:46  <Antimony> I can't figure out how to improve my bot. There aren't any obvious flaws
2011-12-16T21:32:56  <Samvara> You are getting nice neat fronts though... I've not been able to get mine as nice as that
2011-12-16T21:33:23  <ChrisH_> Samvara: pguillory is a tough opponent, his battle code is better than mine
2011-12-16T21:33:42  <ChrisH_> at least at the moment
2011-12-16T21:33:52  <ChrisH_> don't know if i will ever match his though
2011-12-16T21:34:00  <ChrisH_> not with two days left
2011-12-16T21:34:26  <ChrisH_> but i do hope to have the edge in multi-hill maps
2011-12-16T21:34:34  <Samvara> I also did all my optimising against single-hole maps... and roughly mid-size maps. I'm getting whacked in the "cage match" small maps
2011-12-16T21:35:17  <ChrisH_> yeah, i was getting very annoyed by those maps too, so I decided to do something about that, i am a bit surprised how well it has worked actually
2011-12-16T21:35:32  <antimatroid> i'm working on my bots movement out from hills
2011-12-16T21:35:36  <antimatroid> at the moment that is just awful
2011-12-16T21:35:37  <ChrisH_> it was an experiment at first, but if it works you run with it
2011-12-16T21:36:24  <ChrisH_> now I'm trying to make an improvement to how I handle stalemates of combat lines
2011-12-16T21:36:39  <ChrisH_> not sure if it will work, but the early experiments have had good results
2011-12-16T21:37:09  <ChrisH_> i'm probably going to resubmit in a before my next match so I get a full day of games with my latest code before the finals start

2011-12-16T21:38:16  <Samvara> I'm wondering if it's worth running a massive optimization run against small maps and have a bunch of brain-transplant decisions early in the game
2011-12-16T21:39:18  <ChrisH_> depends on your style.  I prefer one size fits all approaches usually
2011-12-16T21:42:11  <Samvara> I've done OK on the midsize maps that I optimised against (e.g. 249305 or 252994) but yeah my front lines are a bit messy
2011-12-16T21:47:44  <Samvara> I only heard about the comp a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't get time off work so I've been missing heaps of sleep... and I've also been on the oncall list so I've been missing even more sleep. Things are starting to get a bit weird.
2011-12-16T21:48:15  <antimatroid> i'm with chris, i like it to work generally
2011-12-16T21:48:20  <antimatroid> within reason
2011-12-16T21:48:27  <Samvara> There's this instinct to say, "well that's quite a reasonable effort, better give up now", but it's hard to see sense when you know you could do better
2011-12-16T21:48:36  <antimatroid> you could even vary the attack radius etc. for my bot and it should still work pretty well
2011-12-16T21:48:43  <antimatroid> although i haven't tested that
2011-12-16T21:49:03  <Samvara> I should probably wear the colours and stuff :-)

2011-12-16T22:03:57  <antimatroid> has anyone done searching from targets to sources and not allowing ants to stay still?
2011-12-16T22:04:01  <antimatroid> i'm finding that surprisingly hard
2011-12-16T22:07:32  <Antimony> why would you prevent ants from staying still?
2011-12-16T22:07:42  <antimatroid> because otherwise they can pile up back to your hill
2011-12-16T22:07:46  <antimatroid> and you sort of get stuck
2011-12-16T22:08:01  <Antimony> well I have an anticlustering tendency
2011-12-16T22:08:02  <antimatroid> or they stall when they could move closer towards their target cause they're stuck by a wall of ants
2011-12-16T22:08:06  <Antimony> so that doesn't happen to me
2011-12-16T22:08:16  <Antimony> but you want them to stall when encountering enemies
2011-12-16T22:08:36  <antimatroid> i'm going to randomise my path finding after i've fixed this so ants sort of spray along the shortest paths
2011-12-16T22:08:44  <antimatroid> but i want to get this streamlining properly first
2011-12-16T22:09:15  <antimatroid> you can still have choke points that ants have to pass for the shortest path though
2011-12-16T22:09:18  <Antimony> Anyway, I'm wondering about lines 1321-1326 of ants.py
2011-12-16T22:09:24  <antimatroid> and sometimes it's better to just get some ants to take a slightly suboptimal path
2011-12-16T22:09:31  <Antimony> I do that too
2011-12-16T22:09:46  <Antimony> distances are increased if they go through ants
2011-12-16T22:09:59  <Antimony> if the blockage is big and dense enouhg they'll go around

2011-12-16T22:15:44  <Kettling> Winning strategy seems to depend heavily on the map. In a tight corridoor map you want to focus on exploration and food finding and then just block off a corridoor if you can't easily push through.
2011-12-16T22:16:34  <Kettling> In a big open map good battle tactics seem to win the day and being able to push back your fronts efficiently (gain ground, without losing too many guys)
2011-12-16T22:20:57  <Kettling> In a tight cage match just throw everything into food collecting and aggression, even if you die grabbing a food at least the other guy didn't get that food, and there's no chance to collect it later
2011-12-16T22:27:04  <antimatroid> Kettling: a good bot will attempt to do all of these things

2011-12-16T22:49:48  <antimatroid> BenJackson: have you ever tried doing pathfinding without letting ants sit still?
2011-12-16T22:49:57  <BenJackson> what now?
2011-12-16T22:49:58  <dragonfyre13> ok, quick question (hopefully). Is there something out there to how I need to create/name my setup_ext file so it's run on the server? Using cython for a module.
2011-12-16T22:51:06  <antimatroid> BenJackson: http://pastebin.com/bNX5CBav
2011-12-16T22:51:30  <BenJackson> what about that?
2011-12-16T22:51:30  <antimatroid> one 'a' is trapped, and another 'a' shouldn't wait, but walk around
2011-12-16T22:51:47  <BenJackson> you want me to run my bot against that?
2011-12-16T22:51:51  <antimatroid> no
2011-12-16T22:52:08  <antimatroid> i want to path find from targets to sources and move them as i search
2011-12-16T22:52:15  <antimatroid> but i want to for example get that 'a' to walk around
2011-12-16T22:52:29  <antimatroid> i think i can then get the trapped 'a' out by randomising path finding
2011-12-16T22:52:32  <BenJackson> there are a lot of a
2011-12-16T22:52:43  <antimatroid> yes, that's why i want to move them as i search
2011-12-16T22:52:57  <jab_bott> antimatroid: why not have the ant join the end of the queue, they all move along one and the front one becomes the one you want to get there?

2011-12-16T22:53:30  <antimatroid> jab_bott: wouldn't it be better to have 1 ant move out of the line and walk around the outside?
2011-12-16T22:53:43  <dragonfyre13> locally I'm running "python setup.py build_ext --inplace", just to get the module available. So have a setup.py file, not sure what else I need to do.  tmc seems to indicate it's as easy as that here: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=1830&p=11024&hilit=cython#p11024
2011-12-16T22:53:59  <dragonfyre13> Tried renaming setup.py as "setup_ext", but that didn't work :P
2011-12-16T22:54:02  <antimatroid> and the 'a' on the right is going to be waiting ages to jump on the end of the line
2011-12-16T22:54:08  <BenJackson> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.37195?turn=1050
2011-12-16T22:54:09  <antimatroid> he could be out into the map way before then
2011-12-16T22:54:12  <BenJackson> that game is kind of screwed up
2011-12-16T22:54:18  <jab_bott> antimatroid: well you could get an ant to your target very quick - like short-circuit path finding... join a solid line of ants and you can effectively teleport to anywhere along the line
2011-12-16T22:54:25  <BenJackson> antimatroid: but watch purple from that point forward
2011-12-16T22:54:35  <BenJackson> watch the multi-ant columns of ants navigate the maze

2011-12-16T23:02:22  * antimatroid gives up
2011-12-16T23:02:27  <antimatroid> ants are going to just wait in line
2011-12-16T23:03:10  <avdg> hmm, is it just me, or does greentea look like almost always winning from xathis?
2011-12-16T23:03:40  <antimatroid> quite a lot
2011-12-16T23:04:01  <BenJackson> perfect, because I beat greentea
2011-12-16T23:04:45  <avdg> xathis has a flaw of taking down the first enemy, even when there is a gap to explore the map (before it gets closed by enemies)
2011-12-16T23:05:20  <avdg> at least if the gap is close to enemies
2011-12-16T23:05:39  <antimatroid> BenJackson: what do you do when path finding out though?
2011-12-16T23:05:43  <BenJackson> now you've just got to exploit that flaw
2011-12-16T23:05:54  <BenJackson> antimatroid: general throngs of ants like that aren't pathfinding
2011-12-16T23:06:04  <antimatroid> ie. if you have a choke point on the shortest path routes, do you make ants line up for the shortest path? or find a less optimal path for other ants?

2011-12-16T23:06:34  <BenJackson> I considered it but I worried about weird bugs

2011-12-16T23:08:28  <BenJackson> codetiger: you've probably noticed, but v10 on bhickey
2011-12-16T23:08:36  <avdg> Kettling: I was trying c++ :p
2011-12-16T23:09:44  <avdg> well, at least, I found out I had -or- spend my times with api's of other libraries -or- spending time writing code I need to find information about the language
2011-12-16T23:10:23  <Kettling> Do the comp organizers come down hard on core sharing? I'll send you my code (with the neural-nets wiped) if you like. Get you started, it's fast :-)
2011-12-16T23:10:25  <avdg> and having good data structures is just damn important
2011-12-16T23:10:55  <thestinger> avdg: C++ has everything except algebraic data types/tagged unions
2011-12-16T23:11:42  <avdg> thestinger: I'm probably a bit too blind fooled by c++11
2011-12-16T23:11:55  <thestinger> well, what data types are in JS that you didn't have?
2011-12-16T23:12:12  <thestinger> javascript has hash tables and dynamic arrays built on hash tables
2011-12-16T23:12:14  <avdg> js is just too slow :p
2011-12-16T23:12:31  <avdg> and the data structures aren't that efficient enough
2011-12-16T23:12:44  <thestinger> std::vector is a dynamic array, and std::unordered_map is a hash table like a javascript object
2011-12-16T23:13:00  <avdg> yeah
2011-12-16T23:13:12  <Kettling> Someone put in a javascript entry?  Imagine winning the comp with a javascript entry, how cool would that be?
2011-12-16T23:13:17  <codetiger> BenJackson: thanks for that... Just noticed
2011-12-16T23:13:20  <thestinger> or tr1/unordered_map if you aren't using C++11
2011-12-16T23:13:34  <avdg> heh, I'm wondering what the position was of my previous js bot
2011-12-16T23:13:39  <thestinger> Kettling: winning with tcl would be awesome :)
2011-12-16T23:13:42  <avdg> I've just submitted a new one

2011-12-16T23:14:02  <BenJackson> codetiger: funny that I watch v10 and think 'nooo don't do that' and then 'ahh, not the current version'
2011-12-16T23:14:21  <avdg> I would be 13th in js rank
2011-12-16T23:14:37  <avdg> but the ranks are close together
2011-12-16T23:15:16  <SMJ> being 1st doesn't seem to be enough for xathis
2011-12-16T23:15:59  <avdg> it looks like that, but I think he just got a good way to develop a good bot quickly
2011-12-16T23:16:34  <SMJ> how's that?
2011-12-16T23:17:02  <avdg> he submitted his bot quite early (but maybe he wrote some code while the site was beta)
2011-12-16T23:17:22  <avdg> and I don't think its bot was really much improved after v1
2011-12-16T23:17:36  <avdg> though I could be wrong
2011-12-16T23:17:52  <thestinger> avdg: beta was going on for months before the contest started in october
2011-12-16T23:17:57  <thestinger> but they added hills
2011-12-16T23:18:07  <BenJackson> xathis v2 is way better than v1
2011-12-16T23:18:08  <thestinger> did xathis v1 actually know about hills?
2011-12-16T23:18:23  <BenJackson> which is scary because v1 was good even though you could see obvious bugs
2011-12-16T23:18:43  <avdg> maybe I'm blind fooled by the bugs in v2
2011-12-16T23:20:03  <SMJ> is his combat code just exceptionally good?
2011-12-16T23:20:13  <thestinger> no, he has amazing strategy
2011-12-16T23:20:19  <BenJackson> his ant efficiency is very good
2011-12-16T23:20:24  <BenJackson> and his strategy is very good
2011-12-16T23:20:27  <thestinger> all those top bots are pretty indistinguishable when it comes to combat
2011-12-16T23:20:35  <avdg> well, his strategy is fine
2011-12-16T23:20:39  <BenJackson> except mine is probably worse
2011-12-16T23:20:50  <thestinger> he sends his ants to exactly where they're needed
2011-12-16T23:21:08  <thestinger> and he has a perfect spread of ants behind the borders for gathering food
2011-12-16T23:21:32  <avdg> I think his spread was one of the basic things of his bot (by my view of it)
2011-12-16T23:22:01  <thestinger> well, he doesn't waste ants
2011-12-16T23:22:22  <avdg> he does, by sending 10 ants where 4 would do the job perfectly
2011-12-16T23:22:39  <avdg> and his bot isn't optimized to work well with less ants
2011-12-16T23:22:47  <thestinger> but he doesn't know how many ants are behind the fog of war
2011-12-16T23:22:52  <antimatroid> thestinger: http://pastebin.com/HHtaZVx1 do you have any suggestions for this example? I want to do one search from targets to sources moving all sources, i want the bottom right 'a' to walk around the line of ants leading away from the hill, and i want an 'a' walking away from the hill to step out of line and walk around to let the trapped 'a' in
2011-12-16T23:22:53  <avdg> too
2011-12-16T23:23:27  <avdg> but sometimes its obvious there couldn't be any more enemies behind
2011-12-16T23:24:17  <thestinger> antimatroid: not sure
