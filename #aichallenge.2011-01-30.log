2011-01-30T21:43:20  <amstan> jbroman: yeah, saw that, you sure it's a good idea to integrate it with amazom so much?
2011-01-30T21:43:31  <amstan> like, they're cool, but do we want to base our framework around them
2011-01-30T21:44:20  <jbroman> I think it's easy enough to decouple and move to another equivalent service later on, if necessary.
2011-01-30T21:44:51  <jbroman> (S3 and SQS are essentially just nice storage and queueing services, both replaceable if need be)
2011-01-30T21:45:03  <jbroman> But they do nice things easily.
2011-01-30T21:45:06  <jbroman> Valid point, though.
