2011-06-16T02:02:31  <McLeopold> rabidus: I haven't really explained it at all, I was waiting for antimatroid to show up
2011-06-16T02:02:57  <rabidus> so you were talking privately
2011-06-16T02:03:13  <McLeopold> Basically, if any ant only attacked, or was within attack range, of one other ant, then its full damage would go to that ant and kill it
2011-06-16T02:03:13  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: the outcome of your --html  update and advices is that you can launch replays for every game during and after the multimap testing. Also my app inserts good bot names in the replay and you can see them in the visualizer.
2011-06-16T02:04:30  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: I attempted to retrieve bot names from command lines passed, but it is a bit broken.  If your app has manages bots, then having a name outside of the command line is a good thing.  So, nice work.
2011-06-16T02:05:11  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: also, if there are bugs or features you need in playgame, please open up issues on github for them and I will fix/code stuff
2011-06-16T02:05:24  <McLeopold> rabidus: back to attacking...
2011-06-16T02:06:10  <McLeopold> For defense, the goal would be to make sure your ant has a buddy to take half the damage from attacking ants.
2011-06-16T02:06:10  <rabidus> i was just wondering... next task for me was good attack planning, but i think i'll move that task a bit
2011-06-16T02:06:36  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: Again, it's my crazy way to work:  When html-file exists I just deal with it as with a text file and adding text info about bots. :)
2011-06-16T02:06:50  <McLeopold> This can be extended to maintaining a higher ant count than the enemy, even in localized situations
2011-06-16T02:07:15  <McLeopold> Which allows for some trivial blocking if the enemy doesn't have freedom of movement, as in corridors.
2011-06-16T02:08:05  <janzert> McLeopold: can you show static blocking of a 4 width corridor with attackradius2=9?
2011-06-16T02:08:07  <janzert> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9140666/ants-r2-9-corridors.png
2011-06-16T02:08:18  <rabidus> i dont get it. what's the difference between now and that ?
2011-06-16T02:08:19  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: yeah, interjecting playernames into the replay file, or into the html replay makes sense.
2011-06-16T02:09:12  <McLeopold> rabidus: There is not two methods of attack.  I'm just disecting the damage method in general.  We have not made changes nor implemented a new attack method.
2011-06-16T02:09:20  <janzert> the best I see is 2 for 1
2011-06-16T02:10:40  <McLeopold> janzert: I ran a test of a column of ants, of different widths, heading in the same direction against a sea of enemy ants.  For every radius there is a shape that will block.  The larger the radius, the larger the shape.
2011-06-16T02:11:13  <McLeopold> So, there can always be blocking, but the shapes may be too large to create.
2011-06-16T02:11:36  <McLeopold> Of course there will be variations depending on where water is and such.
2011-06-16T02:11:40  <janzert> I really don't believe that is true for a radius that has both 'nibs' and 'convex shoulders' (as defined a few days ago ;) )
2011-06-16T02:11:54  <janzert> I also think attackradius2=9 may be the only radius that fulfills that
2011-06-16T02:12:01  <McLeopold> I thought it wouldn't be either, but it is.
2011-06-16T02:12:27  <janzert> I'd really like to see that static shape that will bock the 4 width corridor then
2011-06-16T02:12:49  <McLeopold> The ants were all moving north.  Perhaps I could come up with some side attacks or something, but it looks like there will always be a static shape this is solid.
2011-06-16T02:12:59  <McLeopold> for radius 9?
2011-06-16T02:13:11  <rabidus> thank god my nick isn't radius
2011-06-16T02:13:12  <janzert> radius squared = 9 yes
2011-06-16T02:13:24  <McLeopold> hold on...
2011-06-16T02:13:34  <janzert> I believe it is in use on the beta server now
2011-06-16T02:13:56  <McLeopold> the beta server won't give us any info, there are no good blocking bots
2011-06-16T02:14:08  <janzert> did you see the image I posted above?
2011-06-16T02:14:27  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-06-16T02:14:41  <janzert> that is what I did my check work from to see that 1, 2 and 3 width can be blocked but I don't think 4 width
2011-06-16T02:14:58  <McLeopold> I'm running the test to prove you wrong...
2011-06-16T02:15:04  <janzert> good :)

2011-06-16T02:16:57  <mcstar> how about giving the opportunity to ants to combine their strength?
2011-06-16T02:17:19  <mcstar> for example 2-3 ants could youn up on one square, for a single attack
2011-06-16T02:17:33  <mcstar> if their startegy is good, they could break any block
2011-06-16T02:17:53  <mcstar> but the formation couldnt be maintained for more than a couple of turns
2011-06-16T02:18:50  <mcstar> youn->team up?
2011-06-16T02:19:22  <mcstar> oh no, i meant join up probably, that makes sense
2011-06-16T02:19:47  <McLeopold> I wouldn't mind a single order including an attack square for a single ant
2011-06-16T02:20:19  <McLeopold> janzert: I've messed up my code, it will be just a minute...
2011-06-16T02:20:36  <mcstar> you mean, that only that ant could attack, others cannot, with more than 1 damage to distribute?
2011-06-16T02:21:19  <McLeopold> no, meaning 1 ant can choose not to spread its 1 damage across all enemies in range, but rather choose which enemy to take out
2011-06-16T02:21:29  <mcstar> oh

2011-06-16T02:21:37  <mcstar> yeah, thats not bad either
2011-06-16T02:22:46  <mcstar> i said what i said, because there would have to be some balance maintained between attacking force and the number and spread of ants
2011-06-16T02:23:29  <mcstar> this would certainly make the game strategy wise more interesting
2011-06-16T02:23:43  <mcstar> also its porbably too late for this now isnt it?
2011-06-16T02:24:10  <janzert> not really, especially if the current method can lead to static blocking
2011-06-16T02:24:20  <janzert> of any width corridor that is
2011-06-16T02:24:41  <mcstar> meaning you think the rules can change that much?
2011-06-16T02:24:46  <McLeopold> I also like the idea of ants doling out more than 1 damage, say 1.5
2011-06-16T02:24:59  <janzert> mcstar: yes, if necessary
2011-06-16T02:25:16  <janzert> if static blocking is always possible the rules are basically broken

2011-06-16T02:28:55  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: open a github issue.  Also let Frontier know
2011-06-16T02:30:44  <janzert> McLeopold: ahh, I see the important part is the ability to place ants not just at the end of the corridor but one space further as well
2011-06-16T02:31:22  <mcstar> .˙˙˙˙˙.  these forms can block
2011-06-16T02:31:35  <McLeopold> yeah, so for any radius, there is a shape
2011-06-16T02:32:03  <McLeopold> for set of random waters in there, you could probably modify the shape
2011-06-16T02:32:38  <mcstar> i recently realized that you changed the radii, i was wondering why the f i dont understand a discussion, turned out i was thinking in ar2<=6
2011-06-16T02:32:38  <McLeopold> we probably want the shape to be large enough that it is improbable or impractical to maintain
2011-06-16T02:32:40  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/sMkJYMbp
2011-06-16T02:32:57  <janzert> i.e. there has to be space for those top and bottom b ants
2011-06-16T02:33:34  <janzert> in any case I'd agree the current method is broken enough that we need to do something else
2011-06-16T02:33:46  <janzert> :(
2011-06-16T02:33:55  <McLeopold> so if it is just a solid corridor, you can't block, or in other words, if both bots have the same degrees of freedom, then you can't block
2011-06-16T02:34:30  <McLeopold> it's only when one bot has more freedom of movement that blocking is possible
2011-06-16T02:35:17  <mcstar> and what about attack formations? i dont want to talk shit, but i think 4 ants can always kill 1 ant
2011-06-16T02:35:37  <janzert> active formations are fine with me :)
2011-06-16T02:35:57  <janzert> I'd like to encourage them
2011-06-16T02:35:58  <McLeopold> mcstar: breaking away from 1:1 kill ratios is the goal
2011-06-16T02:36:27  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-16T02:36:51  <McLeopold> janzert: we could try giving each ant more than 1 damage or less than 1 hp?
2011-06-16T02:37:04  <mcstar> comulative damage?
2011-06-16T02:37:23  <McLeopold> we are trying to avoid maintaining ant hp state
2011-06-16T02:38:04  <mcstar> well, it certainly makes the engine simpler
2011-06-16T02:38:27  <janzert> adding extra damage might be the simplest change with a possibility of working out
2011-06-16T02:39:06  <McLeopold> let me try 1.5...
2011-06-16T02:39:09  <mcstar> do you think starter packages should be able to handle them?
2011-06-16T02:39:11  <rabidus> standing still = attack power 0.9 and moving = attack power 1
2011-06-16T02:39:15  <janzert> sure
2011-06-16T02:39:26  <McLeopold> hey, that's a good idea
2011-06-16T02:39:43  <McLeopold> ants have more attacking power if they moved during the turn?
2011-06-16T02:39:47  <rabidus> yes
2011-06-16T02:39:53  <rabidus> like irl
2011-06-16T02:40:03  <McLeopold> what's that?
2011-06-16T02:40:09  <rabidus> you are moving towards your target, you have more power in your arm
2011-06-16T02:40:09  <rabidus> :)
2011-06-16T02:40:09  <mcstar> what if an ant cant move bc of water of his own ants, should it suffer from this restriction?
2011-06-16T02:40:10  <janzert> hmm, that might work as well
2011-06-16T02:40:39  <janzert> it does add more complexity that simply making damage > 1 though
2011-06-16T02:40:40  <mcstar> of->or
2011-06-16T02:40:53  <McLeopold> but it avoids maintaining state
2011-06-16T02:41:29  <rabidus> and irl = in real life
2011-06-16T02:41:34  <rabidus> if you ment that

2011-06-16T02:43:54  <McLeopold> janzert: damage=1.5 still has a defense shape, but it is larger, requiring 2 ants for each incoming for a 4 width corridor
2011-06-16T02:44:48  <janzert> not sure how it gets larger?
2011-06-16T02:45:13  <UncleVasya> mcstar: symptoms are hiding. Illness lies to us, like everybody else. :)
2011-06-16T02:45:41  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you arent an optimist are you :D

2011-06-16T02:48:47  <mcstar> McLeopold: maybe you should make the beta server more secure, so that people may upload their most current bots, i can imagine somebody might have very good solutions, only afraid that others might get his code...
2011-06-16T02:50:17  <rabidus> is there a securiti issues hanging around?
2011-06-16T02:50:21  <janzert> mcstar: then we would have to remove several of the people that have accounts to help out with the coding that don't want to lose the opportunity of competing and things would develop slower

2011-06-16T02:57:11  <McLeopold> easy
2011-06-16T02:57:19  <janzert> actually, I don't think it works
2011-06-16T02:57:43  <janzert> just take your current shape and step it north and south on alternating turns
2011-06-16T02:57:59  <janzert> I suppose it's not technically static, but close enough?
2011-06-16T02:58:19  <janzert> or is there a way to get through it then?
2011-06-16T02:58:29  <janzert> ugh
2011-06-16T02:58:54  <McLeopold> the fact that the shape needs to be larger may be good enough
2011-06-16T02:59:26  <janzert> yeah, possibly
2011-06-16T02:59:27  <McLeopold> the shape is the same with or without the moving ant code
2011-06-16T02:59:56  <janzert> oops, right
2011-06-16T03:00:17  <janzert> since the defenders only need .5 damage
2011-06-16T03:00:26  <McLeopold> damage = 2 works quite nicely
2011-06-16T03:00:59  <McLeopold> the real trick is the defenders just need to make sure each enemy ant is spreading their damage to enough ants

2011-06-16T03:01:35  <McLeopold> for damage=2? not really
2011-06-16T03:01:37  <mcstar> with this reasoning, damage can be a large number even
2011-06-16T03:02:33  <McLeopold> with damage close to 2, but not quite there, it is really nice
2011-06-16T03:02:35  <janzert> once damage is large enough the best tactic seems spread out individuals :(
2011-06-16T03:02:44  <McLeopold> 1 ant can't take out 2
2011-06-16T03:03:08  <janzert> but the 1.5 damage blocking shape still holds
2011-06-16T03:03:19  <McLeopold> but in a fight, if you can manage to get 2 ants close to an enemy, you can probably take them out, even with extra enemy taking some of the extra damage
2011-06-16T03:03:51  <McLeopold> yeah, but that is for only moving 1 direction
2011-06-16T03:04:43  <McLeopold> the fact that some of the damage is 90 degrees to the attacks may give enough room
2011-06-16T03:04:49  <janzert> without "diagonal" moves it doesn't matter how you move into it when coming out of a corridor does it?
2011-06-16T03:05:49  <McLeopold> with damage = 1.9, maybe I should reduce the attack radius again?
2011-06-16T03:06:51  <McLeopold> ooh, that's quite nice
2011-06-16T03:07:38  <McLeopold> 2 width is blockable, but not 3
2011-06-16T03:07:43  <janzert> doesn't a diagonal (or straight if a radius without nibs) line of ants just block then?
2011-06-16T03:08:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-06-16T03:08:43  <McLeopold> not with attackradius=4 and damage=1.9
2011-06-16T03:09:18  <antimatroid> damage > 1 is away from what we want
2011-06-16T03:09:20  <McLeopold> damage=1.5 does block width 3
2011-06-16T03:09:28  <McLeopold> antimatroid: no it's not
2011-06-16T03:09:30  <antimatroid> we wanted balance so that "bunching" up for fights was good
2011-06-16T03:10:08  <janzert> except not so good that you can block with a static shape :(
2011-06-16T03:11:46  <rabidus> what about that 'standing still' vs 'moving' ?

2011-06-16T03:14:07  <McLeopold> damage=1.875 is the sweet spot for breaking a 3 width corridor
2011-06-16T03:15:07  <Zaphus> Evening all, talking about damage multipliers?
2011-06-16T03:15:08  <McLeopold> you can get 3 ants in, the left and right can't attack the same set and get spread to 3 enemies, the center spreads to 5 enemies, so you need 1/(1/3+1/5) damage to break it
2011-06-16T03:15:47  <McLeopold> antimatroid: can you make that latex? :)

2011-06-16T03:17:41  <McLeopold> mleise: yes, and how?
2011-06-16T03:18:26  <mleise> sorry, i haven't followed the discussion. do you mean how to unicode?
2011-06-16T03:18:39  <McLeopold> yep
2011-06-16T03:18:55  <mleise> type charmap and search for 'fifth'
2011-06-16T03:19:28  <Zaphus> So with a 1.85, two ants can kill three (mutually assured destruction anyway)
2011-06-16T03:20:25  <antimatroid> actaully, that might actually make fights more interesting
2011-06-16T03:20:32  <janzert> I'm a bit worried that it removes too much motivation to cluster though
2011-06-16T03:20:45  <antimatroid> but you'd still want to cluster a bit
2011-06-16T03:21:00  <McLeopold> 1 can't kill 2, 2 can kill 3, 2 can't kill 4
2011-06-16T03:21:19  <McLeopold> 3 can kill 5, but now we need to consider position
2011-06-16T03:21:24  <antimatroid> what about 1.4?
2011-06-16T03:21:38  <antimatroid> you need 3 ants in a battle to kill more than 1:1
2011-06-16T03:21:39  <janzert> is blockable
2011-06-16T03:21:42  <mleise> Seems like you found a possible solution for the blocking situations. :)
2011-06-16T03:21:43  <antimatroid> hm okay
2011-06-16T03:21:56  <janzert> even 1.5 was blockable
2011-06-16T03:22:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: your comment the other day about combining iterative closest with damage, hell no :P
2011-06-16T03:22:22  <antimatroid> i'd rather move to power, which would be more understandable :P
2011-06-16T03:22:23  <janzert> although the space needed to block gets larger
2011-06-16T03:22:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I coded it and I agree :D
2011-06-16T03:22:29  <Zaphus> Interesting idea. Of course you now get standoff instead I imagine
2011-06-16T03:23:58  <McLeopold> maybe damage increases for an ant with the number of enemies, whatever makes it so a local 2 on 1 works
2011-06-16T03:24:35  <antimatroid> i don't like the idea of damage amounts differing depending on what the ant dos
2011-06-16T03:24:40  <antimatroid> that's complicating the rules a lot
2011-06-16T03:24:51  <antimatroid> i'd rather we moved to power method if you want to complicate stuff :P
2011-06-16T03:25:08  <McLeopold> The occupied method blocked as well
2011-06-16T03:25:09  <Zaphus> What is the power method ?
2011-06-16T03:25:48  <antimatroid> Zaphus: enemies(A) := the set of enemys within the attack radius of A, A lives if |enemies(A)| < |enemies(B)| for all B \in enemies(A)
2011-06-16T03:26:34  <Zaphus> So ants around you but out of range of attack
2011-06-16T03:26:59  <mleise> In other words, if all attackers get hit by more ants than your own ant
2011-06-16T03:27:30  <McLeopold> you can only kill ants more occupied with enemies than yourself
2011-06-16T03:28:13  <Zaphus> Confusing in words, is there a pic somewhere ?
2011-06-16T03:28:58  <mleise> its because 3 people are talking :p

2011-06-16T03:30:35  <mcstar> i mis-spelled google
2011-06-16T03:30:50  <Zaphus> So an ant could kill one enemy but be killed by one on the other side
2011-06-16T03:31:38  <antimatroid> it's the coolest rule (imo) to date, but it was deemed too complicated
2011-06-16T03:33:25  <Zaphus> It is interesting, but agree it is complex

2011-06-16T04:22:31  <mleise> UncleVasya: It says "You must specify a map file."
2011-06-16T04:23:11  <UncleVasya> I think it's because of  '\' instead of '/'.
2011-06-16T04:24:45  <mleise> hmm I'm not quite sure of it. It can launch the Python program which uses '\' in the path
2011-06-16T04:26:58  <UncleVasya> mleise: somewhere i used TrailingPathDelimiter, somewhere I was too lazy and hardcoded '\'. So you can get a string with both of them.
2011-06-16T04:27:58  <UncleVasya> mleise: or maybe you are using an old environment.
2011-06-16T04:28:13  <UncleVasya> tools.zip was updated few days ago.
2011-06-16T04:29:57  <mleise> hmm if I run the command with bare wine python.exe ... it works
2011-06-16T04:31:27  <mleise> maybe it is the extra space after the map name
2011-06-16T04:32:00  <mleise> UncleVasya: It looks like --map_file "H:\...\symmetric_10,map "

2011-06-16T04:47:51  <mleise> there is also ShellExecute which is a bit more complicated, but you can tell it to 'open' a file. So you could just put a .txt or .py in there and it would launch the associated program

2011-06-16T04:57:16  <mleise> Best is you change the working directory to where playgame.py is and just remove all %dp0

2011-06-16T05:22:48  <sir_macelon> been reading the damage/blocking discussion
2011-06-16T05:23:26  <sir_macelon> i don't like the ideas with changing the battle resolution
2011-06-16T05:23:56  <sir_macelon> i would rather see maps properlu adjusted so that such situations shouldn't be decisive
2011-06-16T05:24:35  <sir_macelon> or on the other hand make it as a part of the game
2011-06-16T05:25:13  <sir_macelon> like in go you have a live formations that cannot be killed
2011-06-16T05:26:11  <sir_macelon> you were also talking about corridors without considering the other end of it, so it is blockable only from one side
2011-06-16T05:26:37  <sir_macelon> unless you have blocked a peninsula
2011-06-16T05:27:23  <sir_macelon> blocking would just another cool tactic
2011-06-16T05:28:39  <sir_macelon> you have to be aware that you "sacrifice" ants so they will be standing still, but they could have been more useful if they would be moving towards food or enemy positions
2011-06-16T05:29:56  <sir_macelon> moreover if we would have symmetric maps, then every player would have an equal opportunity to set his defenses
2011-06-16T05:30:46  <sir_macelon> i don't get it why you don't like blocking so much?

2011-06-16T05:32:36  <sir_macelon> any adjustments to the damage resolution would lead to bunching up won't be a good tactic, because a bunch of ants can be killed with fewer enemy ants
2011-06-16T05:32:48  <sir_macelon> that's just not right
2011-06-16T05:35:49  <mleise> UncleVasya: You set the working directory to where playgame.py is, right? Then it may be fixable on wine if you use only relative paths and '/' instead of '\'. Windows understands that since Windows 2000.

2011-06-16T05:42:30  <Zaphus> sir_macelon:  I agree, I'm yet to see proof that blocking is really bad, people just say it's a bit boring...  so what ?  whatever happens the top bots are going to be similar anyway and be a bit boring - doing standoffs waiting for someone to make a wrong move
2011-06-16T05:43:05  <mleise> I cannot run test.cmd. Don't know how in wine. But I see Linux path names "/home/..." when I change playgame.py to print the working directory
2011-06-16T05:43:35  <Zaphus> and if you're the bot with the lower score (which you cannot tell..) then you'll lose a standoff or blocking battle anyway
2011-06-16T05:43:40  <mleise> so relative paths with '/' *should* work. But I understand if you don't want to make that change
2011-06-16T05:44:13  <UncleVasya> maybe you can launch test.cmd without Wine? Just like usual binary file.
2011-06-16T05:45:17  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: what
2011-06-16T05:45:18  <mleise> hmm ok let me turn this into a shell script quickly
2011-06-16T05:45:25  <sir_macelon> 's boring in blocking
2011-06-16T05:45:44  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: what's boring in blocking?
2011-06-16T05:45:58  <sir_macelon> it's just another tactic
2011-06-16T05:46:14  <Zaphus> I don't think it's boring, but thats the only 'argument' I've heard against it - nobody in the Beta has demonstrated it being a problem so far
2011-06-16T05:46:23  <sir_macelon> it shouldn't be all about attacking
2011-06-16T05:46:43  <sir_macelon> but there should be also some defense possiblities for balance
2011-06-16T05:46:47  <UncleVasya> mleise: If it's the only thing that doesn'tlet my tool work under Linux, I'll fix it. Linux users are dominating here in humber.
2011-06-16T05:47:22  <Zaphus> Look at  Zaphus_BlockTest - it doesnt even block properly, just does a half-hearted attempt - but watching other bots work out ways to cut it back or block it in so it can't get any more food is good
2011-06-16T05:47:30  <mleise> UncleVasya: yes it works! I replaced all absolute paths with relative ones and replaced '\' with '/'
2011-06-16T05:47:40  <UncleVasya> I don't mean I'll abandon Windows users, I mean I'll try to make app more portable.
2011-06-16T05:48:04  <sir_macelon> it depends on what you are blocking actually
2011-06-16T05:48:19  <sir_macelon> you may be blocking yourself
2011-06-16T05:48:24  <sir_macelon> in
2011-06-16T05:48:44  <mleise> UncleVasya: If Delphi had a native Linux version I would still use it for GUI applications!
2011-06-16T05:50:02  <mleise> I don't know if it is good or bad that wine launches the linux python. It's good because it is already installed and it is bad because absolute file names don't work
2011-06-16T05:51:16  <UncleVasya> mleise: If I just replace '\' with '/'  but left absolute paths - will it work?
2011-06-16T05:51:33  <mleise> no the absolute paths are the important part.
2011-06-16T05:52:21  <mleise> playgame.py is launched with windows file names like "C:\..." but cannot find the files because on linux they start with "/..."
2011-06-16T05:53:12  <UncleVasya> ok

2011-06-16T06:15:58  <stocha> hi, i'd like to learn the verilog language. Do you think it would be feasible to support/submit a verilog bot ?
2011-06-16T06:17:56  <Naktibalda> create a starter pack for it :)

2011-06-16T06:21:02  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: Indeed it looks even better with increased attack range, with radius2=4, there were many stale positions
2011-06-16T06:21:31  <Zaphus> If Java worked more consistently the top places would be much more interesting
2011-06-16T06:22:20  <sir_macelon> I don't care about places cause it's beta, but enjoy some real fights :)
2011-06-16T06:22:20  <Zaphus> Don't want to give me a copy of your bot to test against do you ?  :-)   I've got a Stocha and a Leviathan
2011-06-16T06:23:14  <sir_macelon> It could be decompiled, so I wouldn't like to do that
2011-06-16T06:23:41  <Zaphus> yeah, thats not good.. pity you can't just make a .exe of it or something
2011-06-16T06:23:42  <sir_macelon> maybe if there's a way to create a binary undecompilable version
2011-06-16T06:24:06  <sir_macelon> the other solution would be tcp server
2011-06-16T06:25:45  <Zaphus> http://jode.sourceforge.net/ - obfuscate it... but it does seem that Java is by it's nature giving away the code :-)
2011-06-16T06:25:51  <UncleVasya> sir_macelon: I believe NetBeans has an options for code obfuscation  while making jar-file.

2011-06-16T06:29:52  <Zaphus> indeed, I already have one (Leviathan), I just like to get some variety in my local testing, there's only so many times you can play against GreedyBot  :-)
2011-06-16T06:30:42  <Zaphus> Stocha seems very strong, beats Leviathan and me (Zaphus) most of the time locally, is just low down the ladder because of the Java VM issue
2011-06-16T06:31:35  <sir_macelon> I use only stocha's bot so far and still didn't fully exploit it :)
2011-06-16T06:32:09  <sir_macelon> but about this hunting, there's nothing special, it's just like moving food :)
2011-06-16T06:33:04  <Zaphus> not quite, you attack with a wave of ants which is interesting to watch (even if you don't mean to)

2011-06-16T06:35:49  <stocha> stocha curently the starter c bot.
2011-06-16T06:35:54  <stocha> on the test server i mean
2011-06-16T06:36:22  <stocha> i have a project of making a stocha_ref_light and stocha_ref_greedy  C version though.
2011-06-16T06:36:34  <stocha> maybe i'll finish before the test server actually can run some java bot properly
2011-06-16T06:37:59  <stocha> the problem with very log is to know if it even MAKE SENSE to build a bot upon it. I don't know if the current engin will be able to run it. Not speaking about the communication protocol wich may proved quite tricky. So if some people would give me their (enlightened ) opinion about the feasibility of bulding/running a verilog bot ....

2011-06-16T06:38:35  <stocha> The bot most people refers as "stocha" is a kind of stocha_ref_greedy (with some bug added)

2011-06-16T06:39:10  <Zaphus> why are you putting Stocha up as a ref bot ?  thats a pretty strong starting point, right ?
2011-06-16T06:39:15  <stocha> i find the stocha_ref_light more pleasing intellectually. but it's weaker.

2011-06-16T06:39:37  <stocha> Zaphus:  ?
2011-06-16T06:39:54  <stocha> Zaphus: i didn't quite get it.
2011-06-16T06:40:00  <stocha> what was your question ?
2011-06-16T06:40:33  <Zaphus> Stocha:  Your bot, Stocha, is way more powerful than Greedy
2011-06-16T06:40:58  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah. stocha_ref_light might proove to be a good intermediary
2011-06-16T06:41:23  <stocha> Zaphus: the point with Stocha, is that it implements the main thread ideas people will most probably have.
2011-06-16T06:41:33  <stocha> the quick one.
2011-06-16T06:42:17  <stocha> So because people will discus those idea in here at some point, there is little purpose trying to protect them from investigation.
2011-06-16T06:42:48  <stocha> although it seems that bit manipulation obfuscate my code quite well at this point :p
2011-06-16T06:44:47  <berak> hehe, well said.
2011-06-16T06:44:47  <Zaphus> stocha:  Just seems unfair on the people starting in other languages, who don't get that same starting place.  you're doing all sorts of interesting stuff in there :-)
2011-06-16T06:44:48  <stocha> The other thing is :  although i'd like to win the challenge for prooving something to the world, sharing proves to be far more satisfying to me :p
2011-06-16T06:45:31  <stocha> Zaphus: yeah that worry me a bit. Although all people can use the java bot. Java people seems to more keen into doing that.
2011-06-16T06:45:49  <stocha> I don't think anyone tryed or will try to use my code as a starting point though.
2011-06-16T06:46:15  <Zaphus> Is the stocha C bot the same as the java one you sent me the other day ?   because I'd have expected to see it way higher on the ranking if it was
2011-06-16T06:46:18  <stocha> the idea are much more worthy than the implementation itself. Wich would fit only with bit-oriented-thinking.
2011-06-16T06:46:58  <stocha> Zaphus: the current STOCHA-C on the TEST SERVER, is C-STARTER bot !
2011-06-16T06:47:21  <stocha> it's basically even worst than a pure random bot.
2011-06-16T06:47:36  <Zaphus> hmm, now I see why I got confused - I thought you meant you'd made the C-Starter Bot use the Stocha code :-)  not the other way around!
2011-06-16T06:47:52  <stocha> okay :)
2011-06-16T06:48:28  <Zaphus> although people can just grab stocha java bot, make a few tweaks, and upload
2011-06-16T06:49:07  <Zaphus> anyway, back to figuring out why my bot's attacking code is afraid of a single ant sitting all alone :-)
2011-06-16T06:49:12  <stocha> can they.
2011-06-16T06:50:17  <sir_macelon> Zaphus: the wave is just an effect of adjusting the movement of ants so they won't get killed
2011-06-16T06:50:23  <stocha> i didn't really think of that to be fair. i though people would want to put in their own code.
2011-06-16T06:51:32  <Zaphus> stocha:  well, if you release the bot to everyone, they can do that - nothing stopping them... tweak the numbers to get slightly different behaviour.  you underestimate the laziness of people :-)
2011-06-16T06:51:35  <sir_macelon> i also enjoy seeing it battling, because I didn't hardcoded any battle moves, so my ants get only directives which they are figuring out pretty well :)
2011-06-16T06:52:08  <Zaphus> sir_macelon:  It looks great, I really like it, really good to watch
2011-06-16T06:52:11  <stocha> Zaphus: tweak seems quite hard if you don't understand how it works. And if you do, you don't need the code then (wich is buggy also)

2011-06-16T07:11:05  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: I think I found a bug in the playgame.py.  Let's confirm it before posting an issue on the Github.
2011-06-16T07:11:21  <Zaphus> UncleVasya: what is it ?
2011-06-16T07:12:20  <rabidus> something like # >()< at end of the line
2011-06-16T07:12:23  <rabidus> clearly a bug
2011-06-16T07:13:12  <Zaphus> what does it cause to happen ?
2011-06-16T07:13:58  <rabidus> was a joke
2011-06-16T07:14:02  <rabidus> ... :)
2011-06-16T07:14:49  <Zaphus> oh, :-)
2011-06-16T07:15:08  <Zaphus> something like  >8<
2011-06-16T07:15:18  <rabidus> yeah :)
2011-06-16T07:16:10  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: If you  try to involve exe-bot in the fight using relative-path, it will fall unless your bot is not int the same directory as a playgame.py
2011-06-16T07:16:40  <UncleVasya> So "my_bots\MyBot.exe" doesn't works
2011-06-16T07:16:48  <Zaphus> actually, yes, I think I've been stuck trying to do that locally and it didnt work
2011-06-16T07:17:02  <Zaphus> you need the dp0 at the start to make it work, but shouldnt need it
2011-06-16T07:17:03  <UncleVasya> It works only with absolute path.

2011-06-16T07:19:42  <UncleVasya> Zaphus: yes, adding   %~dp0  solved the problem.
2011-06-16T07:25:48  <UncleVasya> mleise: Are you here?
2011-06-16T07:28:03  <mleise> yes
2011-06-16T07:30:34  <UncleVasya> Is it easy to determine that program is running via Wine under Linux?
2011-06-16T07:31:26  <UncleVasya> Or must I ask user to pick his OS?
2011-06-16T07:31:26  <stocha> Okay let me test it this : Anyone in there knows assembly langage ? Do you think a a 64 bits assembly language should be supported for the contest ? if Yes i might try to port my Stocha-ref-light bot to it :p
2011-06-16T07:32:24  <stocha> The question would be, what specifially 64 bit assembly langage will be supported, what about the interfacing with the input/output console.
2011-06-16T07:32:32  <UncleVasya> stocha: Is it your site where "Hellow world" writen in 2000 languages?:)
2011-06-16T07:32:48  <stocha> >_<
2011-06-16T07:33:00  <stocha> it's a cooperative site most probably.
2011-06-16T07:33:12  <stocha> i'm juste interested with verilog at the moment.
2011-06-16T07:33:43  <stocha> a more concret language would be an assembly langage. A more high level language would be C. An even more high level language would be Java.
2011-06-16T07:33:44  <mleise> UncleVasya: I don't quite understand you. A linux user must install wine and then I think it should work.
2011-06-16T07:33:58  <UncleVasya> This one is nice too: http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/
2011-06-16T07:34:20  <stocha> The stocha-ref-bot is design with bit logic at it's core. So building it over the most low level language make sense really.
2011-06-16T07:34:25  <mleise> Maybe some versions of wine don't launch linux python. These would have to install Python for windows into wine as well...
2011-06-16T07:35:03  <stocha> the lowest language i found was verilod. Hence my question about it :p
2011-06-16T07:35:11  <stocha> verilog
2011-06-16T07:35:19  <mleise> But I hope that I can just click on your next .exe and it works!
2011-06-16T07:35:41  <UncleVasya> mleise: I already replaced absolute paths with relative ones. Now I think I must  to replace '\' with '/' if program is running under Linux.
2011-06-16T07:36:32  <UncleVasya> But if it's running under Windows then '\' must stay.
2011-06-16T07:36:47  <stocha> i'd like to learn verilog and apply to job for it. There is a firm that need verilog-er right next to the place i live.
2011-06-16T07:37:01  <stocha> they want experienced user obviously, but well.
2011-06-16T07:37:20  <mleise> UncleVasya: You don't need \ under Windows, trust me

2011-06-16T07:41:31  <mleise> no this is only understood by Windows' cmd.exe
2011-06-16T07:41:36  <UncleVasya> *is it
2011-06-16T07:41:47  <mleise> It works only in batch files on Windows
2011-06-16T07:41:54  <UncleVasya> So I must determine OS anyway?
2011-06-16T07:42:04  <mleise> no, you can use relative paths :p
2011-06-16T07:42:31  <mleise> %~dp0 just gives you the current directory.. but you are there already so you should not need it
2011-06-16T07:42:37  <UncleVasya> I can't use relative paths under Windows without  %~dp0
2011-06-16T07:42:54  <mleise> that is strange
2011-06-16T07:43:21  <UncleVasya> mleise: it's a playgame.py issue.
2011-06-16T07:43:27  <mleise> I don't understand why it would not work
2011-06-16T07:43:36  <mleise> It works on linux
2011-06-16T07:44:14  <UncleVasya> I think playgame.py changing  current directory while it working or something like that.
2011-06-16T07:44:42  <mleise> or the python process is launched i a different directory
2011-06-16T07:45:24  <mleise> you still use the .cmd file, right?
2011-06-16T07:45:41  <UncleVasya> yes
2011-06-16T07:46:15  <mleise> You can let playgame.py print out the current directory on start to verify the problem
2011-06-16T07:46:28  <guyverthree> I'm finding the new tools don't work quite right on windows
2011-06-16T07:46:30  <stocha> relatives path works on winows.

2011-06-16T07:46:37  <stocha> they sure worked last time i tryed.
2011-06-16T07:46:40  <guyverthree> everythign needs a bit of jigging to get it to work correctly

2011-06-16T07:47:00  <stocha> (with command batch file rather)
2011-06-16T07:48:36  <mleise> in the batch file the current working directory is still correct, since %~dp0 works there. So it must happen when python is started by cmd.exe

2011-06-16T08:00:19  <guyverthree> relative paths should just work under windows
2011-06-16T08:00:43  <guyverthree> the only thing i have found is that relative paths in windows are always from the base sscript
2011-06-16T08:01:05  <guyverthree> so if you call one perl script from another the base path is the first script

2011-06-16T09:46:26  <mcstar> your enemies were practically standing still
2011-06-16T09:48:08  <mcstar> why was your second ant turning to the food soo late after a 90deg turn?
2011-06-16T09:48:28  <antimatroid> 90 deg turn?
2011-06-16T09:48:48  <mcstar> what?
2011-06-16T09:49:32  <mcstar> you rather want pi/2 radians?
2011-06-16T09:50:10  <mcstar> antimatroid pls explain what does your question mean?
2011-06-16T09:50:12  <sir_macelon> that's how my a* works
2011-06-16T09:50:28  <antimatroid> mcstar: why not just think of it as n,e,s,w?
2011-06-16T09:50:48  <mcstar> this is easier for me?
2011-06-16T09:50:54  <mcstar> and its comulative
2011-06-16T09:51:15  <mcstar> if it makes a e,s,w i just write 90 deg
2011-06-16T09:51:29  <mcstar> yes, i should have written -90 deg before sry
2011-06-16T09:51:52  <antimatroid> mcstar: i don't get your original point about the second ant?
2011-06-16T09:51:56  <antimatroid> what does it do that's funny
2011-06-16T09:52:04  <antimatroid> i'm interested in sir_macelons a* now
2011-06-16T09:52:21  <antimatroid> i have a new problem for my a* algorithm
2011-06-16T09:52:41  <antimatroid> updating h values efficiently if I take a target out of the set
2011-06-16T09:53:01  <antimatroid> if i can do that, my a* is complete
2011-06-16T09:53:29  <mcstar> well, its just a bit hard to get used to that travelling the edges of the rectangle is as fast as travelling its jagged diagonal :D
2011-06-16T09:54:22  <mcstar> my rather simple alg. makes n,e moves randomly if the food is in that direction
2011-06-16T09:54:55  <mcstar> i mean the selected direction depends upon the quadrant the food is located realitive to the given ant
2011-06-16T09:55:15  <mcstar> so its more like a "staright" line
2011-06-16T09:55:17  <antimatroid> i'm so confused

2011-06-16T09:57:50  <antimatroid> like, when you run it, what are your sources and targets, and what's your h function?
2011-06-16T09:58:02  *** onensora <onensora!Its@e198153.upc-e.chello.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-16T09:58:40  <sir_macelon> i use a* for a single source and single target
2011-06-16T09:58:58  <sir_macelon> so h is very simple, just the distance left to the target
2011-06-16T09:59:34  <sir_macelon> i handle multiple targets by sorting all targets based on the closest distance to closest ant
2011-06-16T10:00:06  <sir_macelon> and just doing a* for the closest source and target
2011-06-16T10:00:22  <antimatroid> so if you have say *....a..%* your a* would just try to send a right somehow?
2011-06-16T10:00:32  <sir_macelon> if it is still the closest after finding path then that's it
2011-06-16T10:00:41  <sir_macelon> take it and move on to the next target
2011-06-16T10:00:49  <antimatroid> and if it's not?
2011-06-16T10:01:13  <sir_macelon> yes it will find the path to the right food first
2011-06-16T10:01:33  <antimatroid> hmmm, i suspect a simple bfs from all food locations might even be faster for you
2011-06-16T10:01:45  <sir_macelon> but then after sorting left food will be on top
2011-06-16T10:01:51  <sir_macelon> and then find a path for it
2011-06-16T10:01:56  <antimatroid> then work on doing a* with that
2011-06-16T10:02:18  <sir_macelon> i find this way quite efficient
2011-06-16T10:02:56  <sir_macelon> if there aren't many obstacles on the way, then it's the quickest way
2011-06-16T10:03:29  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2011-06-16T10:04:03  <sir_macelon> moreover i use single source single target a* to other purposes than just collecting food
2011-06-16T10:04:34  <sir_macelon> checking if enemy will reach the food faster, finding explore paths
2011-06-16T10:05:13  <sir_macelon> finding other path if the initial is not secure
2011-06-16T10:05:22  <antimatroid> if you have multiple targets and don't want to "collect" food enemies can reach fastest, just use their ants as well when collecting with multiple sources
2011-06-16T10:06:55  <sir_macelon> i prefer first checking the distance before trying to find a path
2011-06-16T10:07:26  <sir_macelon> so sometimes you don't even have to look for path
2011-06-16T10:09:13  <sir_macelon> anyway i am not trying to convince you to use a* instead of bfs
2011-06-16T10:09:32  <sir_macelon> i am pretty confident with my way, it fits to my design well
2011-06-16T10:09:38  <antimatroid> i've already decided on a* :P
2011-06-16T10:09:50  <antimatroid> i have it worked out, i just want to make h more efficient
2011-06-16T10:09:57  <antimatroid> otherwise it might end up being slower than bfs
2011-06-16T10:11:36  <sir_macelon> from what i've seen food collection algorithm is not that important, usually you won't have too many targets and simple a* will do
2011-06-16T10:12:07  <sir_macelon> exploration and battles here comes the differences between bots strengths
2011-06-16T10:13:02  <antimatroid> i'm pretty keen on using my food collection algorithm
2011-06-16T10:13:14  <antimatroid> it might not be the fastest, but it's way better than the more trivial ones
2011-06-16T10:14:16  <sir_macelon> food collection algorithm will be nothing without right exploration algorithm
2011-06-16T10:15:11  <antimatroid> yes, that is separate
2011-06-16T10:15:21  <antimatroid> food collection is the first thing i run though
2011-06-16T10:15:42  <antimatroid> then battles, then exploration/maximising visibility etc.

2011-06-16T10:25:34  <UncleVasya> What do you mean by "the ability to play my own bot"?
2011-06-16T10:25:48  <antimatroid> like, i as a human play my bot in a game
2011-06-16T10:25:57  <antimatroid> with the time limit way up so i can actually make my moves
2011-06-16T10:26:07  <antimatroid> that is the ultimate debugging tool
2011-06-16T10:26:27  <antimatroid> live tcp games are just aesthetically awesome
2011-06-16T10:27:04  <antimatroid> also, i'm not going to run windows, so it needs to work on ubuntu, i don't mind running wine, i think people said that worked before?
2011-06-16T10:27:22  <UncleVasya> Do you wanna make some moves instead of your bot or to play versus your bot?
2011-06-16T10:27:49  <antimatroid> i want to play against my bot
2011-06-16T10:28:06  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: I have a version that works fine with Wine.
2011-06-16T10:28:41  <UncleVasya> Wanna link?  It has nothing from what you want but at least you'll see how it looks.
2011-06-16T10:28:53  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how you'd take moves, being able to click and ant then click a target locations would be the coolest, reclicking a selected ant unselecting them
2011-06-16T10:29:09  <antimatroid> i don't have wine installed, i'll do it after next thursday when i'm done with exams :)
2011-06-16T10:29:25  <antimatroid> otherwise i'd settle for manually typing in my moves :)
2011-06-16T10:30:05  <UncleVasya> Also I was thinking about making visual map editor.
2011-06-16T10:30:14  <antimatroid> that would be neat
2011-06-16T10:30:22  <antimatroid> a web app of somekind for that would be coolest
2011-06-16T10:31:47  <UncleVasya> You are painting a part of map using water and start positions, then you choose a type of symmetric  and program builds another parts of the map.
2011-06-16T10:32:10  <UncleVasya> I have no web-experiens at all.
2011-06-16T10:32:16  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2011-06-16T10:32:23  <antimatroid> i have no gui or web experience :)
2011-06-16T10:32:44  <antimatroid> i am more than happy with an application, i was thinking more about other people getting use out of it ;)
2011-06-16T10:33:31  <antimatroid> people will love you for human vs bot mode
2011-06-16T10:33:53  <mcstar> actually a bmp to ascii converter is very easy to make
2011-06-16T10:33:58  <UncleVasya> How can you be happy ith it if you didn't use it yet?
2011-06-16T10:34:20  <antimatroid> if it sufficiently met the description i would be happy
2011-06-16T10:34:24  <antimatroid> that better? :p
2011-06-16T10:36:28  <UncleVasya> "being able to click and ant then click a target locations would be the coolest, reclicking a selected ant unselecting them"   -  it will be very interesting part. I never made stuff like this before so I can not say for sure I can do it. But it doesn't look very hard to implement.
2011-06-16T10:36:44  <mcstar> i did a little script in mathematica, that has real time controls, basically you can drag a point on the board, and the ant moves along, displaying the cumulative damage it would give on nearby squares

2011-06-16T11:26:50  <mcstar> yeah, nubs still exist
2011-06-16T11:26:57  <amstan> all you have to do is git clone, and git pull when you want it to be updated

2011-06-16T11:27:25  <amstan> UncleVasya: you need to look at what magic submit.php does
2011-06-16T11:27:38  <amstan> UncleVasya: it pretty much expects a file to be uploaded to it
2011-06-16T11:28:21  <amstan> UncleVasya: are you familiar with php or another server side language?

2011-06-16T11:30:05  <amstan> UncleVasya: well.. your app should know where the bot is stored
2011-06-16T11:30:13  <amstan> and should pack the whole folder and upload it

2011-06-16T11:31:27  <UncleVasya> Many people (and I am) have trash in the folder where bot's sources are stored.
2011-06-16T11:31:37  <UncleVasya> It can be >2mb.
2011-06-16T11:32:32  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: can you think of anything better than scanning out from the removed target onto an ordered queue and then iteratively finding the "shortest" path neighbour that isn't in the set of locations to be updated? .. or something along those lines...
2011-06-16T11:32:59  <UncleVasya> amstan:  And figuring out what files aren't a trash might be difficult.
2011-06-16T11:33:17  <mcstar> parse the makefile
2011-06-16T11:33:43  <amstan> UncleVasya: yeah, you should add a pre-upload command option
2011-06-16T11:33:51  <amstan> so i can just type make clean in a textbox
2011-06-16T11:33:56  <amstan> and it'll execute it prior to packing
2011-06-16T11:34:08  <amstan> you could even rm things with that
2011-06-16T11:34:23  <mcstar> UncleVasya: do you know the wonders of makefiles?
2011-06-16T11:35:53  <UncleVasya> mcstar: What about people who uses MS Visual Studio, NetBeans etc?
2011-06-16T11:36:41  <mcstar> doesnt everybody has gcc? and makefile is uniform, once you have cygwin
2011-06-16T11:36:43  <UncleVasya> mcstar:  They use Projects instead of makefiles.
2011-06-16T11:37:01  <antimatroid> i use project files with code::blocks
2011-06-16T11:37:06  <mcstar> oh
2011-06-16T11:37:10  <mcstar> noway
2011-06-16T11:37:18  <antimatroid> and mingw instead of gcc
2011-06-16T11:37:20  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: that's pretty much what i'd do but a queue is not strictly necessary
2011-06-16T11:37:21  <antimatroid> when on windows
2011-06-16T11:37:32  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: it needs to be ordered in some way
2011-06-16T11:37:37  <mcstar> makefile is the solution even to overpopulation
2011-06-16T11:37:39  <a1k0n_> i'm on the phone now so i don't have the spare parallel brain capacity to explain
2011-06-16T11:37:40  <antimatroid> i haven't quite ironed out what the ordering needs to be
2011-06-16T11:37:49  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough :)
2011-06-16T11:38:52  <mcstar> UncleVasya: obviously it cant be hard to make the user selec some files, that he wants to package
2011-06-16T11:39:07  <UncleVasya> amstan: pre-upload command option?

2011-06-16T11:42:13  <antimatroid> they were talking about what game to use which ended up being pw

2011-06-16T11:44:56  <carlop> hi, i've red today discussion about change attack sytem
2011-06-16T11:45:24  <mcstar> UncleVasya: sry i dont get the point of that sentence
2011-06-16T11:45:59  <UncleVasya> mcstar: For example, I do upload in this way:
2011-06-16T11:46:41  <carlop> i think that increase the damage for each ant can work, but i think that the main prolem is balancing between avoid blocking and having interesting attack dynamics
2011-06-16T11:47:32  <amstan> antimatroid: i have some logs from tron
2011-06-16T11:47:37  <carlop> cause increasing the damage for each ant imply that a lot of attack end with 1:1 kill/death ratio, so all the problem become who has the biggest army win
2011-06-16T11:47:41  <amstan> antimatroid: but i don't have them there because they were in another channel
2011-06-16T11:48:20  <mcstar> i think UncleVasya is times out
2011-06-16T11:48:22  <UncleVasya> 1. Select those few files my bot consist of.
2011-06-16T11:48:22  <UncleVasya> 2. Click Pack to zip
2011-06-16T11:48:23  <UncleVasya> 3. Switch to the Opera
2011-06-16T11:48:23  <UncleVasya> 4. Press Browse buton, choose my archive and click Upload.
2011-06-16T11:48:26  <mcstar> s->d
2011-06-16T11:49:12  <mcstar> do you select them in in the application that youre developing?
2011-06-16T11:49:35  <UncleVasya> mcstar:  If I go to make it automaticaly I need to make it more comfortable to the user than actions above.
2011-06-16T11:49:52  <UncleVasya> mcstar: No, in my file manager.
2011-06-16T11:49:56  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: nm you do need a priority queue
2011-06-16T11:50:35  <mcstar> UncleVasya: the user must tell at least once what files the project consists of
2011-06-16T11:51:08  <mcstar> i think the best is to let him drag and drop them on a spot on your gui
2011-06-16T11:51:40  <mcstar> the prog. saves them, and when he wants to change soemthing he d&d again, and you update the difference

2011-06-16T11:54:15  <UncleVasya> mcstar: Your way is seems good. Better than ones I had thinking about.
2011-06-16T11:54:32  <mcstar> thats too much work
2011-06-16T11:55:00  <mcstar> if i want to add a file to the archive, just d&d, and its updated, voila

2011-06-16T11:55:19  <UncleVasya> My point now is to figure out the profit of this functionality. I doubt users need it.
2011-06-16T11:55:41  <mcstar> you can add a msg-box before upload: are you sure the upload is complete?

2011-06-16T11:56:24  <mcstar> well, if it wont involve using the browser and a zipper, then yes, it has a point
2011-06-16T11:57:02  <mcstar> frankly, i would do the whole thing in memory
2011-06-16T11:57:30  <mcstar> pull the files, zip with an alg. in the prog. then upload it right away, wo writing to disk
2011-06-16T11:58:29  <UncleVasya> mcstar: The suggestion of automatic upload was:
2011-06-16T11:58:38  <UncleVasya> [22:13:32] <@amstan> oh.. right, someone should make an automated submission upload
2011-06-16T11:58:39  <UncleVasya> [22:13:36] <@amstan> that would be nice to include
2011-06-16T11:59:08  <UncleVasya> But when I try to imagine it's I get something useless or difficult to implement.
2011-06-16T11:59:29  <mcstar> useless: no, difficult: depends
2011-06-16T11:59:31  <UncleVasya> So I need to talk to amstan to understand what he told about.
2011-06-16T12:00:28  <mcstar> im not sure how familiar you are with the above techniques
2011-06-16T12:00:44  <UncleVasya> I like your idea with the list of files.
2011-06-16T12:01:27  <mcstar> are you planning to upload wo the browser?
2011-06-16T12:01:36  <mcstar> thats one of the main questions
2011-06-16T12:01:44  <mcstar> if you cant do that easy, then forget it
2011-06-16T12:02:07  <UncleVasya> there will no Drag'n'Drop.
2011-06-16T12:03:55  <UncleVasya> No, I think I don't need to use browser for uploading. I want to establish connection to the server via Delphi.
2011-06-16T12:06:01  <mleise> I forgot, but is there a HTTP class in Delphi?
2011-06-16T12:06:16  <mcstar> its a shame, d&d is nice, imagine, sy could drop a file to any part of the app. and have it added to the archive

2011-06-16T13:41:12  <|UncleVasya|> mcstar: I have an idea. I can archive all source files in the bot's director and skip files with not suitable extension.
2011-06-16T13:42:25  <|UncleVasya|> I can use masks like *.cpp, *.hs  etc
2011-06-16T13:44:40  <|UncleVasya|> I don't ned to know what files are important and what is a trash because: 1. compiler on the server is not disturbed by un-necessary files  2. Even with un-necessary source files archive will never be bigger than 2mb
2011-06-16T13:45:23  <|UncleVasya|> So user needs only to specify a single directory.

2011-06-16T13:57:31  <mcstar> its hard to type |
2011-06-16T13:58:10  <mcstar> i didnt say this option, cause i dont consider it very elegant at all
2011-06-16T13:58:11  <|UncleVasya|> to type?
2011-06-16T13:58:19  <mcstar> your name begins with |
2011-06-16T13:58:51  <|UncleVasya|> ah, I was disconnected...
2011-06-16T13:59:03  *** |UncleVasya| is now known as UncleVasya
2011-06-16T13:59:04  <mcstar> what if the user has many versions of a source file, for example
2011-06-16T13:59:15  <mcstar> it might get big
2011-06-16T13:59:44  <mcstar> and he could store some other libraries in source code form, which he might not want to upload
2011-06-16T13:59:52  <mcstar> and this is very unflexible
2011-06-16T13:59:52  <UncleVasya> MyBot..cc  always knows what files it needs, doesn't it?
2011-06-16T14:00:12  <mcstar> consider when somebody stores a whole source code hierarchy in directories
2011-06-16T14:00:46  <mcstar> but it might not find what it wants, cause u dont include directories
2011-06-16T14:00:57  <mcstar> and it could want files with whatever extensions
2011-06-16T14:01:11  <mcstar> or even without extensions
2011-06-16T14:01:27  <mcstar> so this opens up a whole bunch of problems
2011-06-16T14:01:39  <mcstar> or can of worms as the english say it
2011-06-16T14:02:16  <mcstar> do you have problem implementing an interface to include files?
2011-06-16T14:02:33  <UncleVasya> I though it's only a theoretical problem and will never happened in practic.
2011-06-16T14:02:36  <mcstar> otherwise i cant understand your hesitation to do so
2011-06-16T14:03:46  <mcstar> what exactly did you think was a theoretical problem?
2011-06-16T14:04:17  <UncleVasya> I didn't read about drag'n'drop yet. But without it choosing files will not be comfortable.
2011-06-16T14:04:32  <mcstar> well, not neccessarily
2011-06-16T14:04:36  <UncleVasya> I meant files with other extensions or without it.
2011-06-16T14:05:00  <mcstar> theres the open file dialog box, and as far as i know it comes in select file version too
2011-06-16T14:05:14  <mcstar> you can select mulitple files there, even directories
2011-06-16T14:05:47  <mcstar> and the functions returns the paths as strings
2011-06-16T14:05:54  <UncleVasya> I'll look at that, thanks
2011-06-16T14:06:43  <UncleVasya> The thing I'm afraid is that profit from uploading feature will be to low compared to its cost.
2011-06-16T14:06:46  <mcstar> actually my after-basic programming experience was in delphi
2011-06-16T14:07:04  <mcstar> as far as i can remember
2011-06-16T14:07:12  <mcstar> wasnt it called Kylix?
2011-06-16T14:07:21  <mcstar> its object pascal right?
2011-06-16T14:07:26  <UncleVasya> Yeah, Delphi for Linux.
2011-06-16T14:08:05  <mcstar> i remember, i was 17? and it was hard to get by the english documentation
2011-06-16T14:08:15  <UncleVasya> yes. Now even a language is called Delphi instead of ObjectPascal, not only the IDE.

2011-06-16T14:20:49  <amstan> but computerwiz_222 doesn't want to get timers, so every 512 samples, he has to stop and continue reading from sd to ram

2011-06-16T14:35:05  <amstan> so it does self-flash
2011-06-16T14:35:24  <a1k0n_> mcstar: it's not a dsp and it's nothing like a pc.  it's a microcontroller

2011-06-16T14:35:41  <mcstar> aham
2011-06-16T14:36:24  <amstan> mcstar: it's like programming a single threaded app, and the only io that you can do is through about 32 bits
2011-06-16T14:36:51  <mcstar> so it reads single instructions from flash?
2011-06-16T14:36:56  <a1k0n_> yep
2011-06-16T14:37:30  <a1k0n_> so to play autotune the news you need to stream from external storage and you have hardly any memory for a buffer
2011-06-16T14:38:11  <mcstar> yeah, i didnt understand this before either "autotune the news"
2011-06-16T14:38:14  <mcstar> whtas that?
2011-06-16T14:38:21  <amstan> a1k0n_: yes, sd card pages are 512 bytes long, and i have 1k
2011-06-16T14:38:22  <a1k0n_> the video with the guy talking about turtles?
2011-06-16T14:38:42  <amstan> mcstar: autotune the news = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qizNQKzatXA
2011-06-16T14:38:50  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-16T14:39:29  <mcstar> so you were streaming that wave through serial port, then this thing decoded his to analog and drived an amplifier?
2011-06-16T14:39:42  <mcstar> his->this
2011-06-16T14:39:46  <amstan> mcstar: no
2011-06-16T14:40:09  <amstan> mcstar: raw audio -> sd card -> mcu -> dac -> speaker system

2011-06-16T14:40:41  <mcstar> would serial be too slow for this?
2011-06-16T14:40:55  <amstan> could be done
2011-06-16T14:41:01  <amstan> but that's not as fun
2011-06-16T14:41:14  <amstan> then it's just a serial connected soundcard
2011-06-16T14:41:45  <mcstar> why didnt you build an in-house radio station?
2011-06-16T14:41:50  <mcstar> that has practical value
2011-06-16T14:42:35  <mcstar> can you do a 2channel fm transmitter?
2011-06-16T14:42:54  <mcstar> i once was trying to build an analoge one

2011-06-16T19:20:35  <antimatroid> my point is, if you put something with less pee in it than tap water into a bucket of tap water, is the concerntration of pee going to have increased or decreased compared to the bucket?
2011-06-16T19:20:43  <antimatroid> surely it will obviously decrease?
2011-06-16T19:21:50  <antimatroid> hmmm, on second read, I don't think they're comparing hte concerntration to the last buckets original concentration

2011-06-16T19:37:10  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: yeah you still need a queue of some sort
2011-06-16T19:37:29  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: or at least an array of lists
2011-06-16T19:37:38  <antimatroid> i think i need to keep it as a priority queue based on what can be reached fastest?
2011-06-16T19:37:47  <antimatroid> including when i update the value of a square and add that to the search queue
2011-06-16T19:40:43  <a1k0n_> yes, you do bfs out from the food square, stopping when the distance from the food square (your depth in the bfs-search) is greater than the distance-to-food in your map, and "deleting" values along the way
2011-06-16T19:40:54  <a1k0n_> wherever you stop, add to the priority queue
2011-06-16T19:41:23  <a1k0n_> then do bfs out from there, propagating outward from each square in the lowest level of your priority q
2011-06-16T19:41:35  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-16T19:41:55  <a1k0n_> should be pretty quick if there's a lot of food out, otherwise i guess it could fill the entire map
2011-06-16T19:42:05  <a1k0n_> still, visiting each square only once
2011-06-16T19:42:25  <a1k0n_> i guess simple optimization is to say if that was the last visible food, there's no need to compute anything
2011-06-16T19:42:57  <antimatroid> yep

2011-06-16T19:59:44  <bhasker> he has very nice a* documents
2011-06-16T19:59:47  <antimatroid> i can paint out the information for the entire grid with one sweep, then update the information every tiem i take a food square out

2011-06-16T20:01:29  <bhasker> though in most cases i am find bfs to be sufficient
2011-06-16T20:01:33  <bhasker> for now
2011-06-16T20:01:46  <bhasker> if you restrict your search to a small distance bfs jsut works fine

2011-06-16T20:02:20  <bhasker> and gameprogramming as well

2011-06-16T20:02:38  <bhasker> that is good too
2011-06-16T20:03:01  <bhasker> check out his terrain generation code

2011-06-16T20:03:03  <antimatroid> it is pretty cool
2011-06-16T20:03:06  <bhasker> very interesting reads
2011-06-16T20:03:12  <antimatroid> doesn't seem to do anything with multiple sources/targets though?
2011-06-16T20:03:16  <sigh> yeah, look pretty cool... thanks, I'll look through it all later :)
2011-06-16T20:03:20  <antimatroid> i've only read the contents though
2011-06-16T20:03:35  <bhasker> no his page mostly just talks about the basic algo, i guess he might touch upont it at some point
2011-06-16T20:03:54  <bhasker> his latest interest seems to be around map generation
2011-06-16T20:03:54  <antimatroid> multiple sources is easy
2011-06-16T20:04:05  <antimatroid> the heuristic for multiple targets is the killer
2011-06-16T20:04:23  <sigh> spawning ants is not exactly a standard problem :P
2011-06-16T20:04:43  <antimatroid> that's a good thing for the game
2011-06-16T20:04:49  <sigh> :)
2011-06-16T20:06:03  <antimatroid> http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html#S15 wtf?
2011-06-16T20:06:06  <antimatroid> that is terrible information
2011-06-16T20:06:30  <bhasker> the wraparound stuff?
2011-06-16T20:06:32  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-16T20:06:38  <antimatroid> you can do a* with that normally fine
2011-06-16T20:06:43  <antimatroid> you just have to update your distance metric
2011-06-16T20:07:00  <bhasker> i guess you could, probably leave him a note:)
2011-06-16T20:08:09  <sigh> yeah, his method seems overly complicated for the problem
2011-06-16T20:09:26  <antimatroid> just a little bit :)
2011-06-16T20:10:03  <bhasker> well its a simplistic approach i guess
2011-06-16T20:10:12  <antimatroid> that's far from simple
2011-06-16T20:10:18  <antimatroid> compared to the other method anyway :P
2011-06-16T20:10:59  <bhasker> another blog that i find interesting is the guy who is writing Detour and recast library
2011-06-16T20:11:11  <bhasker> http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/

2011-06-16T20:11:27  <bhasker> raycast/detour is an awesome free pathfinding library
2011-06-16T20:12:02  <bhasker> if you like playing around with 3d pathfinding check out his library
2011-06-16T20:12:03  <antimatroid> hmmm, i enjoy doing these things myself
2011-06-16T20:12:14  <antimatroid> solving these problems is my favourite part of the contests
2011-06-16T20:12:30  <bhasker> well it depends, 3d pathfinding is rather complicated
2011-06-16T20:12:38  <bhasker> and this library does a lot of neat stuff
2011-06-16T20:12:47  <bhasker> which would take a year or more to implement
2011-06-16T20:12:50  <bhasker> if you did it from scratch
2011-06-16T20:13:00  <bhasker> so if your objective is to write a game
2011-06-16T20:13:12  <bhasker> then makes sense to use it

2011-06-16T20:17:18  <a1k0n_> true 3d pathfinding is tough; i used probabilistic roadmaps
2011-06-16T20:17:24  <bhasker> well its complicated, i think recast uses voxels
2011-06-16T20:17:32  <sigh> why is it tough?
2011-06-16T20:17:35  <bhasker> to first discover the polygons
2011-06-16T20:17:41  <bhasker> and paths
2011-06-16T20:17:45  <antimatroid> i would love to do a 3d ai game
2011-06-16T20:17:49  <a1k0n_> but in like, first-person shooters, the pathfinding is just a 2d graph
2011-06-16T20:17:56  <bhasker> then it builds a graph based on the polygons
2011-06-16T20:18:01  <bhasker> which it then uses for pathfinding
2011-06-16T20:18:10  <antimatroid> i would really love to do mario kart ai
2011-06-16T20:18:36  <a1k0n_> sigh: it's tough because the subspaces are huge and nonconvex and complexly connected
2011-06-16T20:18:44  <bhasker> basically recast does some stuff like floodfilling from multiple points and discovers edges by variation in heights
2011-06-16T20:18:46  <bhasker> at the edges
2011-06-16T20:18:50  <a1k0n_> i mean it depends on the problem obviously
2011-06-16T20:19:17  <bhasker> once it has the edges it basically breaks it up into convex polygons
2011-06-16T20:19:39  <bhasker> and then 3d pathfinding has other concers
2011-06-16T20:19:43  <a1k0n_> i tried to implement A* over a 3D BSP tree where each node was a convex polyhedron.  it worked, but the map was just waaaay too complicated for that
2011-06-16T20:19:46  <bhasker> like shape of the object being moved
2011-06-16T20:19:49  <bhasker> corridor widths
2011-06-16T20:19:53  <bhasker> height
2011-06-16T20:19:55  <bhasker> etc etc
2011-06-16T20:20:06  <bhasker> so its a lot more complicated
2011-06-16T20:20:25  <bhasker> recast does a lot of those things
2011-06-16T20:20:33  <antimatroid> a1k0n_: any idea if there's much money in writing ai for actual video games?
2011-06-16T20:20:44  <a1k0n_> yeah.  well, if you have a "ground" it's at least easier than when you can just move around in arbitrary directions
2011-06-16T20:20:46  <bhasker> well there are complete companies that provide the ai middleware
2011-06-16T20:20:55  <bhasker> like pathengine, which does most of the pathfinding etc
2011-06-16T20:21:01  <bhasker> havok which provides physics engines
2011-06-16T20:21:02  <bhasker> etc
2011-06-16T20:21:13  <bhasker> these companies live on providing middleware
2011-06-16T20:21:14  <antimatroid> cheers :)
2011-06-16T20:22:01  <a1k0n_> antimatroid: well, not afaik..  you get paid as a game developer and work a lot
2011-06-16T20:22:01  <a1k0n_> or yeah, middleware solutions i suppose

2011-06-16T23:25:19  <contestbot> janzert: Aye, aye, sir
2011-06-16T23:26:00  <Pyronaut> If it crashes, do I never get rated for that game, or does it get placed in the queue for later?
2011-06-16T23:26:24  <janzert> currently the results of the game basically never get counted
2011-06-16T23:27:00  <janzert> since the rating script will consistently crash on it it doesn't do any good to run it through again
2011-06-16T23:27:32  <Pyronaut> Dammit. That was a good win aswell :p.
2011-06-16T23:28:55  <janzert> it's starting to look like one of us is going to be forced to write our own trueskill implementation if we want to get something stable :(

2011-06-16T23:30:43  <janzert> something in the implementation isn't converging and errors out after 1000 iterations
2011-06-16T23:31:00  <janzert> I haven't actually looked closely at what exactly it is doing at the time
2011-06-16T23:31:48  <janzert> it is something to do with draw rate though since specifying a larger draw rate seems to prevent it
