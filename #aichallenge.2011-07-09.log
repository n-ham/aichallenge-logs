2011-07-09T00:00:02  <mleise> just wait a month :p
2011-07-09T00:00:31  <amstan> hmm?
2011-07-09T00:00:45  <mleise> It reprofiles after a month ^
2011-07-09T00:00:49  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-07-09T00:00:57  <mleise> I prefer the grub entry though.
2011-07-09T00:01:18  <amstan> so why were you saying that it's static?
2011-07-09T00:01:24  <mleise> I thought it was
2011-07-09T00:01:41  <mleise> Because the Gentoo forum didn't mention this feature :(
2011-07-09T00:02:33  * mleise fixed his forum post
2011-07-09T00:09:22  <mleise> ok, and an ubuntu dev wrote it, not an arch dev

2011-07-09T00:17:09  <mleise> Maybe in the future they'll do the profiling and preloading of files at the same time, so you don't get a slow boot every once in a while when ureadahead is reprofiling. There is also room for improvement with that list beeing fed to an ext4 online defragment tool :D
2011-07-09T00:27:51  <mleise> hmm maybe... if i use the dump feature of ureadahead and some cheap copy-defrag-tool... i can check if defragmenting is an improvement

2011-07-09T04:27:03  <smiley1983> by that I mean that the players and map are the same, though the bots make different decisions of course

2011-07-09T08:42:21  <jmcarthur> i only reboot about once a month anyway :\
2011-07-09T08:44:14  <jmcarthur> it's too late now, but i think for the beta we should have said up front that all bots uploaded to the beta would have their source code revealed at the beginning of the actual contest
2011-07-09T08:44:23  <jmcarthur> i mean, that's not what's going to happen
2011-07-09T08:44:30  <jmcarthur> but i think it should, and we would have had to say up front
2011-07-09T08:44:49  <jmcarthur> that way people aren't going to use their best ideas in the beta
2011-07-09T08:44:53  <sigh> that would have been cool
2011-07-09T08:45:05  <jmcarthur> and we would have a huge selection of "starters"
2011-07-09T08:45:20  <jmcarthur> or at least bots to test against
2011-07-09T08:45:25  <jmcarthur> locally, i mean
2011-07-09T08:45:30  <sigh> how is the beta going?
2011-07-09T08:45:41  <jmcarthur> it seems like development is going slow now
2011-07-09T08:45:52  <jmcarthur> i don't know what the stopper bugs are
2011-07-09T08:46:01  <jmcarthur> but whatever they are, they haven't been changing recently
2011-07-09T08:46:26  <sigh> I stopped watching the issue tracker a long time ago, it's grown a lot
2011-07-09T08:46:32  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-07-09T08:46:54  <sigh> is there a launch date yet?
2011-07-09T08:47:14  <jmcarthur> lol https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/milestones
2011-07-09T08:47:21  <jmcarthur> Launch "due in 18 hours"
2011-07-09T08:47:43  <sigh> :)
2011-07-09T08:48:12  <sigh> oh nice, github has 128 notifications for me -_-
2011-07-09T08:48:31  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's about the same number for me
2011-07-09T08:48:36  <jmcarthur> i rarely even go through those things
2011-07-09T08:48:43  <jmcarthur> oh, actually, i have 184 notifications
2011-07-09T08:49:18  <sigh> I think I just marked everything as read a while back
2011-07-09T08:49:32  <jmcarthur> me too
2011-07-09T08:49:51  <jmcarthur> i wish i could be a member of a project without being subscribed to every activity of the project
2011-07-09T08:50:02  <jmcarthur> i do check the project page every once in a while
2011-07-09T08:50:17  <jmcarthur> which is nicer because things that no longer matter are usually out of sight by then
2011-07-09T08:50:37  <sigh> yeah... I wish I could change the setting so they are different for my own projects
2011-07-09T08:51:26  <sigh> I mean, I would actually care if someone commented on one of my crappy projects :P
2011-07-09T08:51:48  <jmcarthur> yeah

2011-07-09T09:37:07  <GreenTea> Hi
2011-07-09T09:38:40  <jmcarthur> we still aren't giving bots their resource limits at the start of a match. it wouldn't be too much of an impact to change, would it? i think it would be nice to at least give bots their memory limits
2011-07-09T09:38:57  <GreenTea> I think something with selection of opponents for my bot. Very many games vs Sto03RepliCrush. But no games with FlagCapper, TRavary, sir_macelon
2011-07-09T09:39:07  <jmcarthur> maybe i should just make a ticket on github and await comments there

2011-07-09T17:20:54  <antimatroid> yes, why not?
2011-07-09T17:20:59  <mcstar> hehehe
2011-07-09T17:21:04  <mcstar> i dont know, guess
2011-07-09T17:21:13  <antimatroid> because you're a girl? :P
2011-07-09T17:21:19  <mcstar> haha
2011-07-09T17:21:32  <mcstar> when im drunk, i cant ride 2 legs, let alone a bicycle

2011-07-09T17:22:15  <jmcarthur> GreenTea: i agree that this seems suspicious
2011-07-09T17:22:22  <antimatroid> it's also 7 20am :P
2011-07-09T17:22:43  <mcstar> youre drunk at odd hours
2011-07-09T17:22:56  <antimatroid> i was just out late
2011-07-09T17:23:08  <jmcarthur> now is the best time to code
2011-07-09T17:23:27  <antimatroid> i can't do anything like that when i'm drunk
2011-07-09T17:23:28  <mcstar> jmcarthur: time?
2011-07-09T17:23:34  <antimatroid> late at night
2011-07-09T17:23:34  <jmcarthur> state of being
2011-07-09T17:23:39  <antimatroid> oh
2011-07-09T17:23:40  <mcstar> ahhhh
2011-07-09T17:23:43  <jmcarthur> i am joking of course
2011-07-09T17:23:44  <mcstar> no, dont code when drunk
2011-07-09T17:23:46  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-09T17:23:55  <jmcarthur> the ballmer peak is not actually real
2011-07-09T17:24:13  <jmcarthur> balmer?
2011-07-09T17:24:13  <antimatroid> i've had like 10 beers, i think i went past the ballmer peak
2011-07-09T17:24:16  <jmcarthur> not sure of spelling
2011-07-09T17:24:26  <antimatroid> i know of it, no idea of hte spelling
2011-07-09T17:24:39  <mcstar> you can have multiple peaks, like girls, cant you?
2011-07-09T17:24:45  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-07-09T17:25:09  <antimatroid> i'm still waiting to confirm my first female competitor in this
2011-07-09T17:25:23  <antimatroid> we had a transgender last time i think?
2011-07-09T17:25:23  <mcstar> when im drunk, i cant recall anmes, itsss soo annoying, that i rather not drink
2011-07-09T17:25:32  <antimatroid> binky?
2011-07-09T17:26:09  <antimatroid> (i seriously don't mean that in a bad way, my mum is gay, i have absolutely no problems with people no matter what their lifestyle prefences)
2011-07-09T17:26:34  <antimatroid> well, provided they aren't acitively hurting other people

2011-07-09T17:27:08  <mcstar> mean what in a bad way?
2011-07-09T17:27:18  <mcstar> you didnt say anything? did you?
2011-07-09T17:27:32  <antimatroid> transgender, i dunno, seems like some people would bring that up in a negative way...
2011-07-09T17:27:45  <mcstar> i think its a proper term, not prejudical
2011-07-09T17:28:00  <antimatroid> i was really bummed at how much some people in my family made note of such a person at a family wedding last year :(
2011-07-09T17:28:14  <mcstar> of course im not an american indian, so i can be wrong...
2011-07-09T17:28:47  <mcstar> antimatroid: you mean your mom is happy all the time?
2011-07-09T17:29:04  <antimatroid> mcstar: :P, i mean her partner is female :P
2011-07-09T17:29:04  <mcstar> fry and laurie had a sketch about the words gay
2011-07-09T17:29:15  <mcstar> and the other was ass-bender
2011-07-09T17:29:42  <mcstar> they contemplated that those words meant different things before they were used in today's meanings
2011-07-09T17:30:13  <antimatroid> i'm with matt and trey, the context of some words is more important than their "definition"
2011-07-09T17:30:24  <mcstar> south park?
2011-07-09T17:30:26  <antimatroid> yep
2011-07-09T17:30:44  <mcstar> i loved it, although, i dont find it that funny to watc again :S
2011-07-09T17:31:01  <antimatroid> i can't stand the most recent south park, it sucks
2011-07-09T17:31:03  <mcstar> i think i still remember the jokes
2011-07-09T17:31:25  <antimatroid> futurama is going strong though
2011-07-09T17:31:37  <mcstar> seen the pilot only, didnt like it
2011-07-09T17:31:45  <antimatroid> of futurama?
2011-07-09T17:32:18  <antimatroid> your're missing out, one of the writers is a phd student in (i think) physics (or maths), and some of the newer episodes have had some decent maths references
2011-07-09T17:32:40  <antimatroid> there was a cool group theory episode about switching personalities (thank god for autcorrect!)
2011-07-09T17:33:28  * antimatroid finds thank god to be a weird statement yet still uses it, along with oh god :P
2011-07-09T17:33:46  <mcstar> istenem

2011-07-09T17:34:06  <mcstar> im not religious at all, i mean at all, and still say those 2
2011-07-09T17:34:16  <mcstar> god, sweet god
2011-07-09T17:34:22  <antimatroid> i'm not even going to get started on religion
2011-07-09T17:34:30  <antimatroid> i would go on for too long :)
2011-07-09T17:34:37  <mcstar> why? its simple
2011-07-09T17:34:50  <antimatroid> no, dogs
2011-07-09T17:34:54  <antimatroid> how cool are dogs?
2011-07-09T17:35:03  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-09T17:35:15  <mcstar> you switched topic very subtly
2011-07-09T17:35:23  <mcstar> if theres such a word
2011-07-09T17:35:27  <antimatroid> i'm a very subtle guy ;) :P
2011-07-09T17:35:47  <mcstar> i dont give a rats ass about dogs, to quote RDA
2011-07-09T17:35:57  <antimatroid> :(, dogs are awesome
2011-07-09T17:36:00  <mcstar> i have them, but i wish i didnt
2011-07-09T17:36:10  <antimatroid> i wish i still had a dog
2011-07-09T17:36:18  <antimatroid> i did have a border collie, she was awesome
2011-07-09T17:36:21  <jmcarthur> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH64dlgyydM
2011-07-09T17:36:30  <mcstar> i saw her
2011-07-09T17:37:00  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: :)
2011-07-09T17:37:12  <mcstar> ha, yep, its pretty good in hungarian
2011-07-09T17:37:16  <antimatroid> ah yes, i vaguely remember that
2011-07-09T17:37:25  <mcstar> actually thats one of a few movies, that sonds cool translated
2011-07-09T17:37:48  <antimatroid> speaking of cool movies, do you guys like the princess bride?
2011-07-09T17:37:59  <antimatroid> they showed it to us in high school, such a great movie
2011-07-09T17:38:00  <mcstar> nhoi
2011-07-09T17:38:19  <antimatroid> inconceivable!
2011-07-09T17:38:52  * antimatroid realises his miswording with autocorrect for spellcheck /facepalm
2011-07-09T17:39:16  <mcstar> gtg, but i should briefly mention wrt futurama, that i watch big bang theory
2011-07-09T17:39:28  <antimatroid> i watch big bang theory, but i hat eit
2011-07-09T17:40:08  <antimatroid> they have positions of nerds but act like geeks and portrays the stereotype that geeks are equivalent to nerds which i don't like /gets off highhorse
2011-07-09T17:41:16  <antimatroid> amirite though?
2011-07-09T17:42:01  <nann> TBBT: best show ever ;D
2011-07-09T17:42:03  *** nann is now known as Apophis
2011-07-09T17:42:19  <antimatroid> nooooo :(
2011-07-09T17:42:31  <antimatroid> south park was the best show ever
2011-07-09T17:42:45  <antimatroid> lost was awesome. but i wasn't a big fan of the ending
2011-07-09T17:43:12  <antimatroid> or the lack of decent explanations, but such is the problem with such a build up i guess
2011-07-09T17:43:20  <antimatroid> prison break should have ended after 1 season
2011-07-09T17:44:12  <Apophis> south park is vulgar... and proud of that. not my style!
2011-07-09T17:44:41  <antimatroid> i like the south park episodes that hit the nail on the coffin for poltically incorrect topics
2011-07-09T17:44:56  <antimatroid> and the beaver damn episode, cause that's hilarious
2011-07-09T17:45:03  * antimatroid broke the damn
2011-07-09T17:45:08  <antimatroid> dam*
2011-07-09T17:45:11  <antimatroid> damn!
2011-07-09T17:45:18  <Apophis> you don't need a hammer in satire...
2011-07-09T17:46:02  <antimatroid> boston legal was equally as awesome if not more so than south park
2011-07-09T17:46:12  <antimatroid> in that regard
2011-07-09T17:46:22  <Apophis> never watched it ;) but my mother likes boston legal a lot
2011-07-09T17:46:32  <antimatroid> it's a good show imo :)
2011-07-09T17:47:26  <GreenTea> my favourite serial is Breaking bad =) hope season 4 will be soon..
2011-07-09T17:47:47  <antimatroid> i have watched breaking bad, but i don't really consider it a top show :\
2011-07-09T17:47:55  <antimatroid> to each their own :)
2011-07-09T17:48:38  <Apophis> yeah thats why there are more than two serials ;D
2011-07-09T17:48:39  <GreenTea> every episode in it is a little artwork..
2011-07-09T17:48:58  <Apophis> but there will be never anything as good as ST:TNG or Babylon 5 ;D
2011-07-09T17:49:04  <antimatroid> the two guys would be dead or in jail in real life by now :\
2011-07-09T17:49:13  <antimatroid> i have yet to watch the wire
2011-07-09T17:49:22  <antimatroid> i imagine i'll like it, i'm saving it for a "rainy day"

2011-07-09T18:03:56  <mcstar> im not int that world, you know
2011-07-09T18:04:00  <ibdknox> haha it beats C in a lot of cases
2011-07-09T18:04:09  <ibdknox> runtime optimizations are pretty amazing
2011-07-09T18:04:36  <mcstar> i like the idead, of the lazy first/rest
2011-07-09T18:04:43  <ibdknox> yes!
2011-07-09T18:04:51  <ibdknox> lazy sequences are *awesome*
2011-07-09T18:04:59  <ibdknox> you can do so many cool things with them
2011-07-09T18:05:02  <mcstar> and that there are unified functions for all of them
2011-07-09T18:05:07  <ibdknox> mmhm

2011-07-09T18:05:31  <ibdknox> Clojure is hands down the most intelligently designed language I've ever used
2011-07-09T18:05:39  <mcstar> how old is it?
2011-07-09T18:05:46  <ibdknox> and I used to be the PM in charge of C# and VB at Microsoft
2011-07-09T18:05:46  <ibdknox> lol
2011-07-09T18:06:01  <ibdknox> a little more than 4 years old, I believe
2011-07-09T18:06:29  <mcstar> interesting, most 4 year old languages are unknown
2011-07-09T18:06:34  <mcstar> i believe
2011-07-09T18:06:42  <ibdknox> that's a fair statement
2011-07-09T18:07:09  <ibdknox> completely unrelated, I'm beginning to agree that the game might be too simple
2011-07-09T18:07:27  <ibdknox> the bot I have playing right now is about 15 LoC
2011-07-09T18:07:36  <ibdknox> and is winning entirely too much
2011-07-09T18:07:37  <mcstar> name?
2011-07-09T18:07:46  <ibdknox> ibdknox
2011-07-09T18:08:07  <ibdknox> skill of 51.71
2011-07-09T18:08:18  <mcstar> well, thats pretty bad :)
2011-07-09T18:08:27  <mcstar> i mean my random bot had like 56?
2011-07-09T18:08:29  <ibdknox> haha it's beating more than half
2011-07-09T18:08:45  <ibdknox> that's my point
2011-07-09T18:08:51  <ibdknox> a random bot should lose terribly
2011-07-09T18:08:52  <ibdknox> lol
2011-07-09T18:09:19  <mcstar> ok, it wasnt random entirely
2011-07-09T18:09:47  <mcstar> it collected food, and circled with random probailities which were dependent upun turn
2011-07-09T18:10:22  * mcstar starts the spellchecker too
2011-07-09T18:10:39  <ibdknox> this is the basic logic of my bot

2011-07-09T18:10:41  <ibdknox> lol
2011-07-09T18:13:10  <mcstar> the closest function can be pretty sophisticated
2011-07-09T18:13:29  <ibdknox> in my case it's not
2011-07-09T18:13:34  <mcstar> i use the Hungarian method
2011-07-09T18:15:54  <mcstar> actually i dont understand that code
2011-07-09T18:16:14  <ibdknox> which part?
2011-07-09T18:16:24  <ibdknox> basically it goes through each ant
2011-07-09T18:16:37  <ibdknox> finds the closest food, shuffles the two directions to get to that food
2011-07-09T18:16:40  <mcstar> the function is of 0 arity, then where those variables come from?
2011-07-09T18:16:52  <mcstar> directions
2011-07-09T18:17:14  <ibdknox> directions is a global constant
2011-07-09T18:17:16  <mcstar> yes, thats the only one
2011-07-09T18:17:18  <mcstar> aham
2011-07-09T18:17:27  <mcstar> no **?
2011-07-09T18:17:28  <ibdknox> a vector [:north :south :east :west]
2011-07-09T18:17:45  <ibdknox> you only ear-muff things that get rebound in clojure
2011-07-09T18:17:50  <ibdknox> with thread-level bindings
2011-07-09T18:19:14  <mcstar> so you give higher probability to the direction pointing towards a food square?
2011-07-09T18:19:29  <ibdknox> yep
2011-07-09T18:19:32  <mcstar> when-let
2011-07-09T18:19:35  <mcstar> thats interesting
2011-07-09T18:19:57  <mcstar> its actually a (let (()) (when

2011-07-09T18:24:29  <antimatroid> you can do a*, but the heuristic function needs to be a bit more complicated

2011-07-09T18:29:28  <jmcarthur> ah, no
2011-07-09T18:29:45  <mcstar> it very much depends upon the situation, the number of squares needed to be scanned

2011-07-09T18:41:16  <GreenTea> I spend many time to find why
2011-07-09T18:41:17  <mcstar> do you use declare?
2011-07-09T18:41:27  <ibdknox> do it in Clojure!
2011-07-09T18:41:29  <GreenTea> ??
2011-07-09T18:41:33  <ibdknox> then you get lisp on the JVM!
2011-07-09T18:41:34  <ibdknox> lol
2011-07-09T18:41:35  <GreenTea> what declare?

2011-07-09T18:44:17  <GreenTea> i see. something complicated..
2011-07-09T18:44:24  <GreenTea> what it mean?
2011-07-09T18:44:42  <mcstar> you can have tpye declarations and compiler directives with it
2011-07-09T18:44:48  <escortkeel> it gens the optimal path from one tile to another
2011-07-09T18:45:21  <jmcarthur> i'm guessing that the engine doesn't take things like leap seconds into account when timing bots?

2011-07-09T18:58:11  <GreenTea>              {". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . . . . . . % % % . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . . . . . . . * % . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . . . . . . % % % . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . . . . % . . . . . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",                ". . . . .
2011-07-09T18:58:27  <mcstar> escortkeel: you just loop it over, and pick the smallest value?
2011-07-09T18:58:29  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-09T18:58:39  <mcstar> but that can be improved too
2011-07-09T18:58:51  <GreenTea> how many time took to find 20000 time path from A to * ?
2011-07-09T18:58:59  <mcstar> GreenTea: you dont like pastebin?
2011-07-09T18:59:01  <GreenTea> * times
2011-07-09T18:59:07  <escortkeel> :)
2011-07-09T18:59:25  <mcstar> i cant copy those lines from there
2011-07-09T18:59:41  <mcstar> and theyre incorrect
2011-07-09T18:59:48  <escortkeel> that exceeds the IRC
2011-07-09T18:59:51  <escortkeel> limit
2011-07-09T18:59:56  <escortkeel> of a single post length
2011-07-09T18:59:58  <GreenTea> hm
2011-07-09T19:00:29  <escortkeel> basically
2011-07-09T19:00:47  <escortkeel> i find a pthe by searching the squares in order of f
2011-07-09T19:00:58  <escortkeel> and then i work backwards form the end to the start
2011-07-09T19:01:25  <GreenTea> http://www.everfall.com/paste/id.php?spmrcml27f6w
2011-07-09T19:02:12  <GreenTea> so.. here is the map
2011-07-09T19:02:24  <GreenTea> 20000 iterations
2011-07-09T19:03:00  <mcstar> aaa
2011-07-09T19:03:04  <mcstar> GreenTea: come on
2011-07-09T19:03:07  <mcstar> . . . ?
2011-07-09T19:03:17  <mcstar> it should be ...
2011-07-09T19:03:22  <mcstar> i cant load that
2011-07-09T19:03:25  <GreenTea> what?
2011-07-09T19:03:28  <mcstar> i need an Ants map
2011-07-09T19:03:35  <escortkeel> nither can i
2011-07-09T19:03:55  <mcstar> i mean i could, but im not going to dig in previous versions to load this :S
2011-07-09T19:04:09  <GreenTea> ok. i understand)
2011-07-09T19:04:20  <GreenTea> this is my internal format for testing =)
2011-07-09T19:04:31  <mcstar> i just wrote a function to load Ants map
2011-07-09T19:04:38  <jmcarthur> why spaces?
2011-07-09T19:04:43  <mcstar> because there are soo many of them, and everyone uses them
2011-07-09T19:04:52  <mcstar> jmcarthur: probably cause the aspect ratio
2011-07-09T19:05:13  <mcstar> there are no 1:1 fonts around for console
2011-07-09T19:05:31  <jmcarthur> sure, but that doesn't mean you have to actually type spaces and stuff
2011-07-09T19:05:39  <jmcarthur> you could just programmatically add them when you need to view it
2011-07-09T19:05:41  <mcstar> but it displayes nices
2011-07-09T19:05:42  <mcstar> r
2011-07-09T19:06:00  <mcstar> obviously he chose this way
2011-07-09T19:06:04  <mcstar> you asked why....
2011-07-09T19:07:05  <GreenTea> yes. it looks nice..
2011-07-09T19:07:20  <jmcarthur> i'm tired of coding. time for minecraft
2011-07-09T19:10:13  <escortkeel> MINECRAFT! :)

2011-07-09T19:13:35  <mcstar> of course i could use vim to edit that map..
2011-07-09T19:13:59  <GreenTea> hm. you can just remove spaces. and add "m " to begining of every line..

2011-07-09T19:16:02  <jbrechtel> Hi, I've looked for documentation explaining this, but can't seem to find anything....can anyone tell me under what circumstances my ants would kill each other?
2011-07-09T19:16:49  <jbrechtel> nevermind
2011-07-09T19:16:53  <ibdknox> if they move to same space
2011-07-09T19:16:58  <GreenTea> yes)
2011-07-09T19:17:12  <jbrechtel> I swear I guarded against that and still saw it happening, but just saw it in the docs
2011-07-09T19:17:12  <jbrechtel> thanks
2011-07-09T19:17:18  <jbrechtel> must inspect more carefully
2011-07-09T19:17:59  <GreenTea> maybe lisp will be fast with declare. but. code is so weird.. and java is already fast withoud handmade optimizaitions ^_^
2011-07-09T19:22:15  <mcstar> GreenTea: with manhattan heuristic: ~0.4sec, with better heuristic: ~0.3
2011-07-09T19:22:56  <GreenTea> cool.. my result is 1 second
2011-07-09T19:23:12  <GreenTea> wih GreenTea heuristic)

2011-07-09T19:26:50  <mcstar> it would check almost all tiles, i can run that

2011-07-09T19:30:36  <jbrechtel> Excuse my ignorance, but is it obvious what the better heuristic than the manhattan one is here?
2011-07-09T19:30:40  <mcstar> GreenTea: and those arent hand-made optimizations, they are just like when you declare a variable with type
2011-07-09T19:30:56  <jbrechtel> Are you just referring to some variation of Manhattan with more domain/game specific knowledge?
2011-07-09T19:31:04  <mcstar> jbrechtel: weighted a* is usually better, and you have to experiment
2011-07-09T19:31:31  <mcstar> its c*d_manhattan
