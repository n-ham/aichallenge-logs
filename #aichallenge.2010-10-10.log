2010-10-10T01:39:18  <Frontier> Oh you cannot call virtual functions in C++-constructors. Thats opposite to what i'm used from Delphi and Java, but good to know I'll need some init()-function
2010-10-10T01:41:30  <blbrown_win3_> is virtual function a non final function?
2010-10-10T01:42:00  <Frontier> Yes, it is a function you can 'modify' in derieved classes.
2010-10-10T01:44:51  <Frontier> I often do some initialization in the base class constructor using data i get from functions of the sub-classes I create. That doesn't work in c++. In the base class constructor the object you create is always treated as if it was of the base class.

2010-10-10T01:46:20  <blbrown_win3_> in Java, they generally discourage calling other methods in the constructor because the calling method could blow up
2010-10-10T01:46:28  <blbrown_win3_> and then the object won't be created.
2010-10-10T01:47:09  <bhasker> frontier you can
2010-10-10T01:47:24  <bhasker> you can't call them because its the constructor that sets up the vtable

2010-10-10T01:55:43  <Frontier> I have some static objects in my sub-classes that provide default values, and in the base class constructor I tried to query these static objects from the sub classes and initialize some members of the sub-class with the default values they provide.
2010-10-10T01:56:59  <Frontier> The following tunable_count() and tunable_declaration() are virtual funcitons:

2010-10-10T03:00:51  <janzert> pretty much known bug that the visualizer always shows the first player as the one to have the error
2010-10-10T03:01:43  <janzert> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=189
2010-10-10T03:05:23  <Frontier> Could it be that the maps in the starter pack aren't exactly symmetric? It seems there are little differences in the distances, but I'm not sure yet.
2010-10-10T03:07:11  <janzert> not that I've heard of before. I do know the java visualizer view starts up "squished" though
2010-10-10T03:07:16  <Frontier> Hmm, they should have centered them all around 0,0 to go sure there will be no rounding errors.
2010-10-10T03:08:15  <Frontier> I ran my bot against the same version on map 2 and on one turn the game becomes unsymmetrical although the bot is 100% deterministic.
2010-10-10T03:08:27  <janzert> not surprising
2010-10-10T03:08:49  <Frontier> janzert: You are NOT surprised?
2010-10-10T03:08:54  <janzert> nope :)
2010-10-10T03:09:06  <Frontier> May I ask why?
2010-10-10T03:09:10  <janzert> I've seen and heard that a lot
2010-10-10T03:09:15  * krokokrusa nods
2010-10-10T03:09:38  <sigh> the positions of the planets are symettric, but the map as a whole is not
2010-10-10T03:09:40  <janzert> one reason that can cause it are the planets are fed to both bots in the same order
2010-10-10T03:09:48  <krokokrusa> one possible reason is that when you sort planets by some criteria, some planets have same value
2010-10-10T03:09:54  <sigh> because of planet ids, yes

2010-10-10T03:11:37  <janzert> you can see the behavior just by fighting bullybot against itself btw
2010-10-10T03:11:47  <Frontier> at least I don't reorder the planets for player 2, so the order in which they appear in the list has an influence.
2010-10-10T03:14:11  <Frontier> I will still check the distances of the planets, just to go sure.
2010-10-10T03:42:04  <Frontier> Distances were ok, krokokrusa was right about the order of planets, I corrected the ids for player 2 and have equal games now on all maps :)

2010-10-10T06:51:20  <delt0r_> bad java is...
2010-10-10T06:51:28  <delt0r_> just as bad C/C++
2010-10-10T06:52:05  <delt0r_> if the sand box doesn't cause undue performance resstrictions there is no reason to expect java to have a performance penatly compared to C++

2010-10-10T06:52:28  <Frontier> It is not slow, but does it compile to native machine code?

2010-10-10T10:29:50  <Frontier> Ok, evolutionary algorithms DO pay off :D
2010-10-10T10:30:23  <delt0r___> you got one working?
2010-10-10T10:31:06  <Frontier> It may not be what you expect. I call it auto-tune(tm). Look for "frontier" on the TCP server and compare my two entries.
2010-10-10T10:31:54  <Frontier> They both use the same code base. One is running with my guessed values in the formulas, the other is running with auto-tune(tm) values.
2010-10-10T10:32:55  <delt0r___> right
2010-10-10T10:34:25  <epona> can i see some of these algorithms?
2010-10-10T10:35:55  <Frontier> epona: There is nothing to see ^^. Do you have some constants in your code?
2010-10-10T10:36:31  <Frontier> like planet_value = 3.4 * distance + pow(ships, 0.9) ?
2010-10-10T10:36:43  <Acount> need 1 more mounth
2010-10-10T10:36:51  <epona> well, to be honest I kind of have a problem with the platform to run the bots
2010-10-10T10:36:54  <Acount> to many worck
2010-10-10T10:37:03  <epona> i should probably be focusing on that
2010-10-10T10:38:37  <Frontier> These constants are hard to get right. You end up recompiling and testing for hours. So I made these constants variables that I can tune from outside the bot in a host application. There I automagically narrow down the optimal values for each constant and update the code once I got a good working set.

2010-10-10T12:14:37  <deepblue> lesson learned today
2010-10-10T12:14:52  <deepblue> long int 32bit < long int 64bit
2010-10-10T12:15:06  <deepblue> local machine 64bit, official serves 32bit
2010-10-10T12:15:08  <deepblue> -_-
2010-10-10T12:16:19  <rebelxt_> nrub: oppo columns shows average opponent's rating, AFAIK

2010-10-10T12:17:48  <rebelxt_> deepblue: good to know. i'm on 64 bit but have not had any problems on the server probably due to using python
2010-10-10T12:18:00  <nrub> aha
2010-10-10T12:18:23  <deepblue> yeah, I should switch to something with guaranteed data type sizes
2010-10-10T12:18:35  <deepblue> but I need a lot of cpu power so C it is
2010-10-10T12:18:44  * oPless leaves his stuff running in the hope it'll learn rapidly  now :)
2010-10-10T12:20:35  <rebelxt_> deepblue: i'm now thinking of re-writing my bot in c++.. new python bot will likely time out on the server unless i bail out before calculations are finished
2010-10-10T12:21:16  <deepblue> will probably give you a few percent more performance
2010-10-10T12:21:37  <deepblue> i force my bot to be done under 800ms
2010-10-10T12:22:21  <rebelxt_> deepblue: are you working on new submission? our bots play regularly on the official server since our bots seem to hang out pretty close on the leaderboard
2010-10-10T12:23:23  <deepblue> just submitted a new version I worked on the last days after not working on the bot for a week
2010-10-10T12:23:31  <deepblue> all my submissions on the official server were buggy
2010-10-10T12:23:38  <deepblue> due to the long int issue :/
2010-10-10T12:24:47  <rebelxt_> ahh
2010-10-10T12:25:26  <deepblue> lets hope it works this time ;)
2010-10-10T12:25:34  <rebelxt_> are you using the same algorithm that managed to beat Garry Kasparov? ;-)

2010-10-10T12:47:45  <davidjliu> lol, yeah... something's messed up. As in, everything
2010-10-10T12:48:03  <davidjliu> maybe I should just switch back to my actually functional bot...
2010-10-10T12:48:42  <Migi32> this new bot seems to have made it to the top 50, so it looks pretty functional as well
2010-10-10T12:49:11  <davidjliu> I mean, I guess it's functional, but it's just... weird
2010-10-10T12:50:01  <Migi32> it's a little aggressive, and is quick to abandon planets in exchange for capturing a planet of the opponent
2010-10-10T12:50:17  <Migi32> or that's at least how it looks to me
2010-10-10T12:50:47  <davidjliu> yeah, this is very true. As in, it doesn't reserve any ships ever, unless being directly attacked

2010-10-10T14:20:00  <jmcarthur> Migi32: comments are a poor subsitute for good code and are easy to make out of date
2010-10-10T14:20:12  <Naktibalda> real programmer doesn't write comments
2010-10-10T14:20:18  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't say that
2010-10-10T14:20:22  <jmcarthur> but i do write very few comments
2010-10-10T14:20:31  <jmcarthur> aside from library documentation
2010-10-10T14:20:42  <Migi32> in C++ I couldn't survive without comments. C++ is great but not very readable
2010-10-10T14:21:01  <jmcarthur> i don't think C++ is that hard to read
2010-10-10T14:21:04  <jmcarthur> i dislike it for other reasons
2010-10-10T14:21:17  <Naktibalda> Real programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read.
2010-10-10T14:21:22  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-10-10T14:22:11  <Migi32> jmcarthur, compare "foreach (i in array)" to "for (std::vector<T>::const_iterator iter = array.begin(); iter != array.end(); ++iter)"
2010-10-10T14:22:44  <jmcarthur> that's not a syntactic issue. that's a semantic issue
2010-10-10T14:22:56  <jmcarthur> if C++ semantics allowed for higher level loops then that crazy iterator wouldn't have to exist
2010-10-10T14:23:05  <Zannick> they do

2010-10-10T17:09:47  <pjreddie> now most of the time i "lose" first turn
2010-10-10T17:10:11  <epona> its the mutating algorithms
2010-10-10T17:10:22  <Utkarsh> pjreddie: it says the other playing didn't start.. ?
2010-10-10T17:10:55  <Meatkat> pjreddie: do you have a watch on clock time? Maybe we're getting less cycles now
2010-10-10T17:11:00  <pjreddie> half the time it says :pjreddie crashed / did not start / timeout
2010-10-10T17:11:09  <pjreddie> the other half it says the other person
2010-10-10T17:11:29  <pjreddie> from what i can tell it's always the person who is red thta "crashes"
2010-10-10T17:11:39  <Zannick> the error message always says player one
2010-10-10T17:11:41  <Zannick> it's a known bug
2010-10-10T17:11:47  <pjreddie> ah
2010-10-10T17:12:01  <Zannick> does it say lose or win on your profile?
2010-10-10T17:12:07  <pjreddie> lose
2010-10-10T17:12:15  <Zannick> then it's you :P
2010-10-10T17:13:04  <pjreddie> yeah but i donow why, it's literally the exact same code
2010-10-10T17:13:10  <pjreddie> maybe we are getting less cycles
2010-10-10T17:13:21  <Utkarsh> hmm. pretty sure my error is something different. havent been able to run my bot since day 1
2010-10-10T17:13:23  <pjreddie> but it would have to be a lot less, my code is pretty simple
2010-10-10T17:16:54  <pjreddie> ya... i really don't think i'm timing out. i just did a little experiment, ran it with smaller and smaller time limit, i don't time out until i get below 50 ms for time limit
2010-10-10T17:17:10  <Zannick> what language?
2010-10-10T17:17:12  <pjreddie> and server time limit is supposed to be 1000ms right

2010-10-10T17:17:45  <Zannick> sorry, no idea
2010-10-10T17:18:17  <pjreddie> is there anywhere we can dl new maps?

2010-10-10T18:18:24  <bhasker> does anyone have a modified script that will replay a server game and let you visualize it locally?
2010-10-10T18:18:31  <bhasker> like if i want to make changes to my bots and see the game play out
2010-10-10T18:22:04  <janzert> not sure how that would work once your bot makes a different move than was played in the game
2010-10-10T18:22:12  <Migi32> bhasker: you can get the playback string, save it to a file "replay" or something, then do something like "$ replay | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar"
2010-10-10T18:22:13  <Migi32> I think
2010-10-10T18:22:36  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-10T18:23:16  <Migi32> but yeah, that's only for replaying a server game
2010-10-10T18:23:50  <Zannick> there's a script somewhere in the forums, i seem to recall
2010-10-10T18:24:19  <Migi32> but I wouldn't recommend inserting different orders while keeping the enemy's orders the same, that makes no sense
2010-10-10T18:25:13  <Migi32> it's like "ok I know the opponent played scissors, let's see if I can change my strategy to beat that". "Hey, new strategy: I should always play rock!"
2010-10-10T18:25:48  <Zannick> parse_game_state_url.py, my logs say
2010-10-10T18:26:10  <ShaneHudson> that is weird, my bot just lost after 1001 turns twice lol
2010-10-10T18:26:17  <Zannick> yeah, i think the point is to replay the game so you can see what your bot is doing that you can't
2010-10-10T18:26:27  <Zannick> that you can't on the server

2010-10-10T18:29:25  <sigh> Migi32: I think it's more like, on turn x, my bot issues a stupid order... let's try to change the code so that it doesn't
2010-10-10T18:29:30  <rebelxt_> bhasker: if you want to parse and replay the whole game locally, you could use http://github.com/apinkin/planetwars-python-kit/blob/master/parse_game_state_url.py (based on dmj's script)
2010-10-10T18:29:39  <sigh> if you are only looking at one state, then it makes perfect sense

2010-10-10T19:02:52  <Tankh> the new algorithm looked awesome on map 1, cause there are 2 fronts kinda, and they flanked the enemy from both sides :P
2010-10-10T19:03:04  <sigh> yeah, that's what my bot does
2010-10-10T19:04:01  <sigh> my bot doesn't have an global redistribution strategy, each planet decides independently who it wants to send its ships
2010-10-10T19:04:29  <Tankh> yeah I took that approach aswell
2010-10-10T19:04:45  <Tankh> and has to request for help
2010-10-10T19:04:53  <Tankh> and then other planets look for planets that need help
2010-10-10T19:05:01  <Tankh> which works most of the time at least
2010-10-10T19:05:17  <sigh> I just know that planets need help if it is going to be taken over :P
2010-10-10T19:05:27  <sigh> they don't need to ask :D
2010-10-10T19:06:29  <Tankh> those little buggers just wants a life of their own so i thought i might let them control the help part themselves :P
2010-10-10T19:06:37  <sigh> but I treat help as part of the attack phase, I "attack" planets that are not owned by me in the far future
2010-10-10T19:07:09  <sigh> the redistribution is just "I've got left over ships, lets send them somewhere useful"
2010-10-10T19:07:21  <sigh> its the very last step of the strategy
2010-10-10T19:08:59  <Tankh> yea same here, first all planets check if they need help, then check if someone else needs help. then attack different planets, and lastly if they dont have enough ships to attack or are in range to help planets they just send support
2010-10-10T19:09:22  <Tankh> well thats the idea. sometimes it does stuff i didn't intend :P
2010-10-10T19:09:35  <sigh> :)
2010-10-10T19:09:37  <Tankh> like sending support to front line when a planet next to them needs help
2010-10-10T19:09:48  <Tankh> sometimes they do sometimes they don't. not sure what's going on there

2010-10-10T19:18:44  <rebelxt_> Tankh: haha same issue here. also experimented with a lot of different "ship supply chain" algorithms and had similar experience to sigh's and yours. so no longer sending ships through intermediate planets..
2010-10-10T19:19:47  <Tankh> aww damnit
2010-10-10T19:19:51  <Tankh> i thought it looked so cool
2010-10-10T19:20:07  <sigh> I remember back when just having any supply chain got you into the top 10 :P
2010-10-10T19:20:25  <rebelxt_> Tankh: however, i have a lot of experience playing Galcon, and it's common practice among top level players to supply ships through intermediate hops.. i.e. no long flights that put you at risk of getting attacked when too many of your ships are in flight
2010-10-10T19:21:28  <Tankh> i dont have much galcon experience.. i had played it like 50 games half a year ago so i knew what the game was about
2010-10-10T19:21:35  <sigh> I think hopping might be better as well, but I think direct exploits a weakness that exists in many of the current bots (even top ones)
2010-10-10T19:21:41  <Tankh> also did the challenges on www.galcon.com/flash
2010-10-10T19:21:48  <sigh> just a guess though :P
2010-10-10T19:22:17  <rebelxt_> imho, the goal should be to send supply ships as far as possible towards closest "front" planet without putting any of your planets at risk
2010-10-10T19:23:15  <rebelxt_> sigh, you must be right! i'm also keeping hopping algorithm just in case we will need it later when bots get even smarter ! ;-)
2010-10-10T19:23:28  <Tankh> haha
2010-10-10T19:23:50  <Tankh> good thing i did a backup on my old straight line algorithm then
2010-10-10T19:24:04  <sigh> yeah, most of my variants are just different config options to my bot
2010-10-10T19:24:55  <Tankh> im also wondering about the thing some bots do, where they just sit and wait when they know they have more ships and production than the enemy
2010-10-10T19:25:10  <Tankh> and just act defensively when they get attacked
2010-10-10T19:26:24  <sigh> I tried to make my bot change strategy based on if it was ahead or behind
2010-10-10T19:26:26  <sigh> fialed
2010-10-10T19:26:28  <sigh> *failed
2010-10-10T19:27:15  <rebelxt_> Tankh: yep. my bot does this as a side effect of the way scoring function works.  - i.e. scoring function calculates profit from attacking neutral and enemy planets does not return anything worthy of attack
2010-10-10T19:27:43  <Tankh> right
2010-10-10T19:28:03  <Tankh> as long as any planet has ships enough to capture a planet, it will try
2010-10-10T19:28:34  <Tankh> always aiming at the best valued one, but best doesnt mean good. it just takes the best that is available at the time
2010-10-10T19:29:10  <Tankh> also hard to tweak distance penalty
2010-10-10T19:29:12  <rebelxt_> here is what human players seem to do in Galcon when they are just a bit ahead on production and ship count - they start putting minimal pressure (small attacks) on enemy to make sure he is not able to expand and get even/ahead
2010-10-10T19:30:10  <sigh> Tankh: man, I know exactly what you mean about distance penalty
2010-10-10T19:30:11  <Tankh> sounds smart
2010-10-10T19:30:38  <sigh> I have quite a few hacks so that my bot doesn't attacks things at a stupid distance
2010-10-10T19:30:44  <Tankh> right now i think i add a penalty of twice or three times the distance to their ship count
2010-10-10T19:31:28  <rebelxt_> sigh. yeah i hate these hacks in my code... looking for a way to avoid one-offs and it's hard
2010-10-10T19:31:30  <Tankh> wonder if it's worth to try something other than a linear increase of penalty according to distance
2010-10-10T19:31:48  <rebelxt_> Tankh: yep. there is a way to build a scoring functions which takes "everything" into account (cost of conquering, distance, growth, planet's neighbour score, etc)
2010-10-10T19:31:50  <sigh> rebelxt_: yeah, I agree
2010-10-10T19:32:12  <Tankh> yeah of course you can always make it more complex :P
2010-10-10T19:32:50  <Tankh> in the end you might have improved your bot with 0.1% but its performance varies +/- 50% depending on which map it is

2010-10-10T19:34:10  <Tankh> I'm having great fun with this contest though. There are some plans on putting up a local server for our school to motivate some programming for new students, which would be awesome
2010-10-10T19:34:18  <sigh> :)
2010-10-10T19:34:41  <rwa> I've gone through several iterations of layering little hacks on one after the other, then I realize what I really wanted to do could be put into one fundamental framework, then I remove all the little hacks...
2010-10-10T19:35:13  <Tankh> but can be a bit frustrating some times.. failed two times with the "helping planets" algorithm. then stopped for a week and got it finished yesterday
2010-10-10T19:35:38  <rwa> I'm only now getting close to my algorithm doing what I thought it was doing... getting my debugging tools in order
2010-10-10T19:36:15  <rebelxt_> Tankh: nice. i have a private tcp server, and it helps a lot.. running 5-6 of my bot's versions on it 24x7. this makes testing new bots much easier and more reliable than just benchmarking against one previous version..
2010-10-10T19:36:17  <Tankh> ah yeah debugging.. first i tried putting crazy "issueOrder" commands on various places just to see when/if it would crash :P
2010-10-10T19:36:51  <Tankh> yeah I think one of us has a way to simulate combat on all 100 maps, but haven't got hold of it yet
2010-10-10T19:37:25  <sigh> haha
2010-10-10T19:37:35  <sigh> get proper logging :P
2010-10-10T19:37:38  <rebelxt_> Tankh: i have scripts for all of that ;-) let me get a link
2010-10-10T19:39:10  <rebelxt_> Tankh: http://github.com/apinkin/planetwars-python-kit (see README and shell scripts). are you using unix by any chance?
2010-10-10T19:39:39  <Tankh> oh that for python?
2010-10-10T19:40:30  <Tankh> using win 7
2010-10-10T19:40:32  <rebelxt_> Tankh: yep but you can still re-use batch scripts (there is one for running a tournament against example bots on all maps, another script to run against tcp server, a script to parse a server game and replay it locally, etc)
2010-10-10T19:40:50  <rebelxt_> Tankh: that's fine. you can use Cygwin to run shell scripts on Win7
2010-10-10T19:41:25  <Tankh> ok, thanks for the link man
2010-10-10T19:41:31  <sigh> yeah, I have python scripts to do pretty much the same things
2010-10-10T19:41:38  <Tankh> hopefully testing bots will be easier now
2010-10-10T19:41:54  <rebelxt_> sigh: nice! ;-)
2010-10-10T19:42:15  <rebelxt_> Tankh: cool hope this helps
2010-10-10T19:42:55  <sigh> my tournament script stores the results in an sqlite db, if I ask it to run a match it's already played it outputs the stored result :)
2010-10-10T19:43:02  <Tankh> well i gotta go now but ill idle in the channel just for funsies.

2010-10-10T19:53:10  <rebelxt_> i was bored and fully automated bot testing ;-) i.e. just fto or scp bot file to the tcp server, and server automatically detects it and starts playing never-ending tournament against other bots. this might have been an overkill though ;-)

2010-10-10T20:46:00  <evilbotzz> i checked for some other people as well, seems no one has gotten updated
2010-10-10T20:46:21  <evilbotzz> but its only been 4 days
2010-10-10T20:46:46  <janzert> yeah, probably just hasn't done another batch yet then

2010-10-10T20:50:18  <sigh> c++
2010-10-10T20:50:21  <sigh> why?
2010-10-10T20:52:31  <epona> Im just wondering, Ive never worked with c++
2010-10-10T20:52:49  <sigh> I'm pretty much in the same boat :P
2010-10-10T20:53:17  <epona> so, do you have programs for tactics? or how are you approaching the game
2010-10-10T20:53:50  <sigh> what do you mean by programs for tactics
2010-10-10T20:54:25  <epona> like does your bots strat change a lot
2010-10-10T20:54:35  <sigh> not really
2010-10-10T20:54:54  <sigh> overall I just score all target for attack, and attack the highest scores
2010-10-10T20:55:09  <sigh> to attack a target, I just grab the closest ships
2010-10-10T20:55:38  <sigh> score is a function of distance, cost and growth rate
2010-10-10T20:57:16  <sigh> I have a defence phase at the start to lock ships that can't be used for attack, and a redistribution phase at the end to move ships to better locations
2010-10-10T20:57:33  <sigh> that's my entire strategy in a nutshell

2010-10-10T21:11:14  <Zannick> which likely means you have to install it

2010-10-10T22:17:33  <dmj111> i wonder if it isn't stable because it isn't really valid.  given enough games, I am sure cfaftw and felixcoto would pound mine into dust.  yet somehow,....
2010-10-10T22:17:59  <dmj111> (among others, that is.)
2010-10-10T22:18:23  <dmj111> davidjliu: if I recall, our last dozen matches were decidely in your favor :)
2010-10-10T22:18:42  <sigh> there is simply no dominant strategy
2010-10-10T22:19:14  <dmj111> that may have been what I was reaching for.  but you hit it on the head.
2010-10-10T22:19:36  <sigh> it's easily possible that a bot can come along that beats Hazard all the time but loses to _iouri_ all the time and changes the entire top 10 with one entry
2010-10-10T22:21:46  <davidjliu> heh, yeah... I hope for the final competition that after a while they take the top fifty or so and just play like a thousand games for each bot or something to firmly establish placement
2010-10-10T22:21:59  <sigh> yeah
2010-10-10T22:22:08  <sigh> I think that stuff is happening all the time I think, just not as obviously
2010-10-10T22:22:20  <sigh> and it will happen in the final tournament as well

2010-10-10T22:42:53  <antimatroid> pure maths seems to have hooked me mostly though
2010-10-10T22:44:10  <dmj111> sounds good.  I have a math degree too.  I always loved pure math, but knew I didn't have it in me to be a real mathematiciain.

2010-10-10T22:45:08  <deepblue> and from there into game theory
2010-10-10T22:45:24  <antimatroid> applied maths is so gross, i hate my current pdes unit (although it's got lots of hand wavy physics explanations)
2010-10-10T22:45:43  <antimatroid> applied seems to be a lot of messy grunt work, whereas pure makes you actually think and is really awesome
2010-10-10T22:45:45  <deepblue> I can't do pure math so I'm getting my PhD in theoretical physics next year
2010-10-10T22:46:11  <dmj111> Yeah.... applied math for me was mostly for signal processing... a lot of FFTs.  pde's and ode's just didn't work well for me.
2010-10-10T22:46:26  <deepblue> applied actually has something todo with the real world and solving problems. I liked that
2010-10-10T22:46:30  <antimatroid> algebra and analysis :)

2010-10-10T22:46:35  * sigh feels stupid listening to all this
2010-10-10T22:46:53  <deepblue> I only did game theory stuff in applied math
2010-10-10T22:46:54  <deepblue> and network theory
2010-10-10T22:47:16  <antimatroid> i had a crappy eco course on it, the rest is self taught
2010-10-10T22:47:30  <antimatroid> so crappy it stuck to 2 player games
2010-10-10T22:47:48  <deepblue> I agree
2010-10-10T22:47:51  <deepblue> would have been fun
2010-10-10T22:47:58  <deepblue> but looking at my code now
2010-10-10T22:48:06  <dmj111> I bought a bunch of Dover books on it.  I manage to get through some of them...
2010-10-10T22:48:09  <deepblue> I would need to redoo a few sections and that would suck
2010-10-10T22:48:22  <antimatroid> did you get the differential games ones? i term that as multiplayer optimal control theory
2010-10-10T22:48:29  <antimatroid> haven't learnt much yet, but looks awesome
2010-10-10T22:48:45  <dmj111> no... I tried to stick to the intro to game theory types... that way I might understand them.
2010-10-10T22:48:46  <antimatroid> if you have a maths background, myersons book is my favourite for game theory and still reasonably affordable
2010-10-10T22:49:10  <deepblue> I heard about that
2010-10-10T22:49:17  <deepblue> I should check it out from the library
2010-10-10T22:49:32  <antimatroid> it's an actual maths text, fudenberd and tiroles is good, but it's written for economists
2010-10-10T22:49:39  <antimatroid> fudenberg*
2010-10-10T22:50:45  <antimatroid> what are you guys doing these days?

2010-10-10T22:51:17  <antimatroid> although my partner for these comps is at the same point as me (finishing 4 year undergrad degree) and only turned like 20 earlier this year :|
2010-10-10T22:51:56  <dmj111> definitely.... I have been a programmer for 12 years, and all of my positions have been for someone who can deal with math.

2010-10-10T23:10:48  <antimatroid> for a first naive implementation of a tree i'll probably determine payoffs based off of ourShips - theirShips + remainingTurns(ourGrowth - theirGrowth)
2010-10-10T23:11:07  <antimatroid> maybe thow in something about position strengths as well
2010-10-10T23:11:33  <antimatroid> throw*, I'm using position strengths when evaluating planets naively atm
2010-10-10T23:11:59  <deepblue> I'm already curious how it will play out :)
2010-10-10T23:12:01  <antimatroid> i have average distance to all other planets, then I also do a sweep each turn for average neutral/enemy/friend planet distance too
2010-10-10T23:12:38  <deepblue> I had a funny issue
2010-10-10T23:12:42  <deepblue> I once told my bot
2010-10-10T23:13:07  <sigh> antimatroid: I plan to try minimax, I set up some of the framework last week
2010-10-10T23:13:10  <deepblue> to calculate the mass center of mine and the enemies ships and try to get them closer together
2010-10-10T23:13:23  <deepblue> in hope
2010-10-10T23:13:29  <deepblue> it would move more ships to the front
2010-10-10T23:13:35  <sigh> antimatroid: my current bot is half a step minimax, just a max if you will :P
2010-10-10T23:13:37  <davidjliu> huh, that's interesting
2010-10-10T23:14:01  <sigh> I tried a few centrality measures, that failed
2010-10-10T23:14:05  <antimatroid> yes that's what mine is doing atm, and it's still picking the most individually optimal moves it can, rather than optimal combination
2010-10-10T23:14:08  <deepblue> result was it attached the furthest away enemy planet and trie to push the centers closer this way
2010-10-10T23:14:12  <antimatroid> and i am not looking forward for expansion at all :\
2010-10-10T23:14:51  <deepblue> hehe

2010-10-10T23:15:01  <deepblue> I think I solved my expansion issues for now
2010-10-10T23:15:19  <antimatroid> hmmm, here would be a possible idea for selecting moves, just try to write yourself a bunch of reasonably different bots that cover specific points well
2010-10-10T23:15:22  <deepblue> now I need to wait for more results from the official server to see what I can improve on nex
2010-10-10T23:15:24  <nrub> I've had only moderate success with center mass calculations
2010-10-10T23:15:27  <antimatroid> then make moves from each at each node in the tree
2010-10-10T23:15:37  <nrub> it always fails if you get flanked
2010-10-10T23:16:02  <deepblue> yeah
2010-10-10T23:16:13  <deepblue> I've given up on centrality measures or compactness measures
2010-10-10T23:16:27  <deepblue> there are maps
2010-10-10T23:16:32  <deepblue> with small clusters
2010-10-10T23:16:37  <deepblue> it just fails there
2010-10-10T23:16:42  <nrub> you need to have more localized calculations
2010-10-10T23:16:46  <antimatroid> i don't try to make any "macro" decisions, i want the strategy to work on any possible map
2010-10-10T23:17:06  <antimatroid> but i will use such measures for "micro" decisions
2010-10-10T23:17:13  <nrub> i think it
2010-10-10T23:17:27  <nrub> I think it's good to look for clusters to attack
2010-10-10T23:17:32  <antimatroid> oh god, measure theory makes my head want to explode

2010-10-10T23:20:21  <antimatroid> aye, someone is above hazard
2010-10-10T23:20:40  <antimatroid> !rankings
2010-10-10T23:20:41  <contestbot> antimatroid: Top 10 players: extrapostrophe(3841), Hazard(3790), cfaftw(3770), rsergio(3768), dmj111(3763), ofrias(3749), felixcoto(3738), sequoh(3722), EBraun(3710), goldman(3680)
2010-10-10T23:21:38  <janzert> probably a fluke though since it's under 20 games and doesn't have a loss yet

2010-10-10T23:22:23  * janzert again wishes confidence interval reporting was in
2010-10-10T23:22:41  <antimatroid> possibly
2010-10-10T23:23:24  <amstan> so.. who's hazard?
2010-10-10T23:23:31  <janzert> looks like it'll be a top ten bot certainly
2010-10-10T23:23:40  <rwa> I still have a notion of centrality in my bot.  Several times I've thought it was misleading the bot, but then I pull it out and the bot gets worse overall.
2010-10-10T23:23:40  <Zannick> whoa, someone new is first
2010-10-10T23:25:00  <antimatroid> janzert: i expect the bots to get a lot better yet
2010-10-10T23:25:20  <janzert> I agree, I meant in the current top ten
2010-10-10T23:25:24  <epona> im so fail at this
2010-10-10T23:25:27  <janzert> not final
2010-10-10T23:25:37  <janzert> necessarily :)
2010-10-10T23:25:41  <antimatroid> i was getting decent periods in first place on the main server with under a week to go for tron, then we were pretty well set at around 10th in the final tourny till we timed out
2010-10-10T23:26:17  <janzert> I'm glad time outs have been changed to a loss now
2010-10-10T23:26:24  <rwa> I'm to the point of considering trying to make some of parameters dynamic to adjust to my opponent...
2010-10-10T23:26:25  <antimatroid> same

2010-10-10T23:26:27  <deepblue> I don't think the bots will improve much over the current level
2010-10-10T23:26:53  <nrub> I think they will
2010-10-10T23:26:56  <janzert> I'll be surprised if they don't
2010-10-10T23:27:07  <rwa> deepblue:  will be interesting to see.  I would not actually be too surprised if somebody came along with something that dominates the current leaders.
2010-10-10T23:27:13  <antimatroid> yeah, i expect mine to get a lot better yet
2010-10-10T23:27:26  <Zannick> i think i'm going to stop working on mine for tonight, though
2010-10-10T23:27:40  <nrub> there are several new guys on top 10 atm
2010-10-10T23:33:18  <pjreddie> is there anywhere to dl bigger map packs
2010-10-10T23:34:14  <nrub> you can download more from http://72.44.46.68/maps/map###.txt
2010-10-10T23:34:28  <janzert> or just download the map generator and make all you want
2010-10-10T23:34:33  <nrub> just iterate from 100 up to ~450

2010-10-10T23:37:32  <pjreddie> @nrub lol was just writing this in python but that's easier, thanks

2010-10-10T23:38:04  <deepblue> ok guys
2010-10-10T23:38:07  <deepblue> I'm tired
2010-10-10T23:38:21  <deepblue> and the official server puts out games way to slowly
2010-10-10T23:38:26  <deepblue> I'm heading to bed :)

2010-10-10T23:41:32  <janzert> spot price is still low enough that I think there should be two of them going
2010-10-10T23:43:01  <Zannick> how many active admins do we have these days?
2010-10-10T23:43:15  <Zannick> i heard danielvf is away for a while, and j3camero never shows up...
2010-10-10T23:43:26  <janzert> yeah, I'm not really sure
2010-10-10T23:44:26  <janzert> of course the weekend is probably worst, I've heard that some people do stuff then :)

2010-10-10T23:47:44  <Zannick> amstan: i may be asking you later this week to do a pull of the compile script

2010-10-10T23:48:22  * Zannick shrug
2010-10-10T23:54:18  <amstan> i don't think i can do a pull, lots of ppl edited the contest working dir, and didn't update svn
2010-10-10T23:54:21  <amstan> so a pull would replace them
2010-10-10T23:54:24  <amstan> so annoying..
2010-10-10T23:54:33  <Zannick> oh
2010-10-10T23:58:33  <janzert> yeah, the server changes really need to be added back into svn
2010-10-10T23:58:52  <janzert> I'm afraid to work on much more until then
