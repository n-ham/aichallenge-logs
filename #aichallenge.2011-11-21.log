2011-11-21T11:37:21  <praveen_> only one ant will go for one square. But each turn, I recalculate all the squares and again find which ants is the best to reach which square and this is causing huge oscillations

2011-11-21T11:59:41  <McLeopold> looks like the game rates are still bad though
2011-11-21T11:59:45  <McLeopold> or, uneven
2011-11-21T12:00:04  <McLeopold> that might be inactive bots...

2011-11-21T12:06:16  <janzert> roughly :)
2011-11-21T12:06:26  <McLeopold> so, what about another bias?
2011-11-21T12:06:36  <McLeopold> maybe only pull in 1 inactive per match?
2011-11-21T12:06:44  <McLeopold> or only 50% can be inactive?
2011-11-21T12:06:46  <janzert> I'd really rather not
2011-11-21T12:07:24  <McLeopold> I'm thinking that if 1 active pulls in only inactive, that isn't helpful to those participating actively
2011-11-21T12:07:34  <McLeopold> how about every match must have 2 active?
2011-11-21T12:07:36  <janzert> once we start doing that the ranking system will have the potential for more problems
2011-11-21T12:07:57  <McLeopold> such as?
2011-11-21T12:08:07  <janzert> if that 1 active happens to be a starter bot it should be playing starter bots
2011-11-21T12:08:22  <janzert> and there is a good chance it should be inactive
2011-11-21T12:08:34  <janzert> the opponents that is
2011-11-21T12:08:39  <McLeopold> I don't think that matters.
2011-11-21T12:08:51  <McLeopold> if the new starter plays real bots, it will lose and be pushed down faster
2011-11-21T12:09:01  <janzert> farther than it should be
2011-11-21T12:09:04  *** lericson <lericson!~lericson@aurorum104-0.aurorum.se> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-11-21T12:09:33  <McLeopold> so you think our pairing can drastically affect the skill?
2011-11-21T12:09:48  <analyst74> also given 10 bots in available range, there could be only 1 inactive bot, making that bot more likely to be chosen
2011-11-21T12:09:51  <janzert> of course
2011-11-21T12:11:05  <McLeopold> I'd like to see the games per 24 hours be at least 24
2011-11-21T12:11:08  <janzert> extreme example, if you play one bot of pair only against xathis and one only against starters the skill result will be drastically different
2011-11-21T12:11:21  <janzert> McLeopold: that'd be higher than planetwars
2011-11-21T12:11:34  <McLeopold> I thought planetwars was around 48?
2011-11-21T12:11:49  <janzert> roughly every 90 minutes I'm pretty sure
2011-11-21T12:12:03  <McLeopold> so ~16
2011-11-21T12:12:13  <McLeopold> we are still less than half that
2011-11-21T12:12:45  <a1k0n> moar cpus
2011-11-21T12:12:48  <janzert> yeah, and a way more computationally intensive game plus a whole lot more participants
2011-11-21T12:13:21  <McLeopold> so, what about dropping starter bots?
2011-11-21T12:13:56  <janzert> I'm more against it now
2011-11-21T12:14:16  <McLeopold> you think the provide useful info?
2011-11-21T12:14:21  <janzert> amstan and I discussed it for a while after you asked the other night and pretty much talked me out of it
2011-11-21T12:14:56  <janzert> I think they provide a useful service more than useful info :)
2011-11-21T12:15:00  <amstan> McLeopold: we have too many versions of the starter bots, it would be too painful to have hashes for all of them
2011-11-21T12:15:09  <amstan> i don't even think we can get some of the older hashes
2011-11-21T12:15:19  <McLeopold> amstan: that is not a problem for me, I can classify them
2011-11-21T12:15:22  <janzert> but I need to run, I should be around later this evening
2011-11-21T12:15:40  <amstan> McLeopold: how will you classify them? all you have a is a zip
2011-11-21T12:16:06  <amstan> if someone unpacked them, then repacked them, it's likely that the dates inside the zip changed, so the hash changed
2011-11-21T12:16:30  <McLeopold> amstan: I'll start with the most comming duplicate hashes and work down from there confirming starter bot behavior
2011-11-21T12:16:32  <amstan> if we do hashes on the inside, we'll have to unpack them on the manager, right now they're just kept as zips in there
2011-11-21T12:16:32  *** jstrong <jstrong!~jstrong@189.229.21.108> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-21T12:16:38  <McLeopold> /common/
2011-11-21T12:16:53  <McLeopold> a hash of the zip should be good enough
2011-11-21T12:17:14  <amstan> i'm pretty sure the zips contain modified date in them
2011-11-21T12:17:39  <amstan> so we cann't get the hashes from the old starter pack versions, since any git checkout changes the modified date
2011-11-21T12:18:03  <McLeopold> again, I just need to look at the most common duplicates in the database
2011-11-21T12:18:34  <McLeopold> it may not be 100%, but if we stop playing them, it should make a big difference in game rate
2011-11-21T12:19:14  <amstan> are you going to disable them like you did for the timeouts?
2011-11-21T12:19:15  <janzert> McLeopold: I really don't think you're going gain that much anyway, since 1/3 of players all of which are ranked below 1590 aren't playing any games anyway.
2011-11-21T12:19:20  <amstan> they'll play, but they won't be seeds anymore?
2011-11-21T12:19:32  <amstan> McLeopold: right! that was another one of my points
2011-11-21T12:19:44  <amstan> McLeopold: no begginer keeps their starter bot active intentionally
2011-11-21T12:19:59  <amstan> McLeopold: they'll submit the starter bot and it'll play for a max of 3 days
2011-11-21T12:20:10  <UncleVasya> What's about make some low-end in strength sparring bot and run a few games against it for every new upload. If uploaded bot is weaker than that 'Guardian', do not accep it ('compiled but is weaker than we want.'?)
2011-11-21T12:20:13  <McLeopold> okay, I may still attempt to classify, but I won't do any logic with it
2011-11-21T12:20:28  <amstan> oh, ok, so just an experiment
2011-11-21T12:20:36  <McLeopold> at least to get data
2011-11-21T12:21:41  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: we still want to allow any unique bot to compete at any level
2011-11-21T12:22:02  <UncleVasya> ok
2011-11-21T12:22:04  <McLeopold> restricting starter bots is more about restricting users who aren't actively participating

2011-11-21T12:23:25  <amstan> this goes to the core of the contest experience
2011-11-21T12:23:55  <amstan> i think it's fine the way it is to be honest, as long as they get a decent ammount of games in that 3 day timeout window
2011-11-21T12:24:09  <McLeopold> someone suggested since all starters are the same, everyone who uploaded a starter gets the same set of game results.  I thought that was interesting

2011-11-21T12:27:32  <jstrong> yeah, I think being able to upload a starter bot is cool
2011-11-21T12:27:35  <Garf> I think the tutorial now says explicitly "now upload your starter bot". Maybe it should say 'now think about how to improve your bot, test locally balbla. If it works, upload your bot like this"'
2011-11-21T12:27:50  <jstrong> however if getting rid of the huge amount of inactive starter bots would make games go faster..

2011-11-21T12:37:08  <a1k0n> the question is: are we measuring wall clock time or CPU time?
2011-11-21T12:38:35  <UncleVasya> yep, you leave time. But the point is that you timeout between checks for the time.
2011-11-21T12:39:13  <UncleVasya> In the place that you think is always fast.

2011-11-21T15:11:30  <UncleVasya> You can't build a jar or you can't launchit?

2011-11-21T15:11:52  <speakeasy> build the jar itself
2011-11-21T15:14:13  <UncleVasya> yep, maybe python will be better for you. I think it's esier to start compete with that language than with java.
2011-11-21T15:15:21  <speakeasy> lol i think your defo right there, java has always been a little line hungry for me
2011-11-21T15:15:31  <speakeasy> thanks
2011-11-21T15:15:41  <UncleVasya> Also I think  in terms of programming a bot for Ants c++ will be easy too. Easy to start and easy to write in.
2011-11-21T15:16:23  <speakeasy> hmmm, i will take a look, thanks
2011-11-21T15:17:02  <UncleVasya> Because you will not feel the famous difficulty of c/c++ until you want to go deep.
2011-11-21T15:17:45  <speakeasy> how do you mean?
2011-11-21T15:18:43  <pairofdice> Yeah, you don't need many fancy features
2011-11-21T15:21:10  <speakeasy> wow python has v few files verses the java starter pack
2011-11-21T15:21:16  <speakeasy> java seems icky now
2011-11-21T15:21:46  <speakeasy> what sort of information and instructions can you get givven and give out for the bot?
2011-11-21T15:22:01  <speakeasy> thanks so much for the help guys, really appreciate it
2011-11-21T15:23:10  <roflmao> I think Java is easier
2011-11-21T15:23:15  <pairofdice> c++ bot has quite a few files too, throws atleast me off a bit
2011-11-21T15:23:19  <roflmao> sure, py is easier as a language
2011-11-21T15:23:20  <roflmao> but it is slower
2011-11-21T15:23:27  <roflmao> much much slower
2011-11-21T15:23:42  <roflmao> so unless you have a very good grasp of python, you'll end up making a lot of mistakes that cause your code to run slow and will wonder while
2011-11-21T15:23:43  <roflmao> why*
2011-11-21T15:23:48  <UncleVasya> speakeasy:  Here is detailed game specification: http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#Bot-Input
2011-11-21T15:23:53  <Garf> well, pypy support was just added

2011-11-21T15:24:00  <roflmao> since java is inherently faster, you can be a bit lazier with your code and it will still run pretty darn fast
2011-11-21T15:24:08  <Zao> roflmao: On the other side, writing fast incorrect code doesn't help much either.
2011-11-21T15:24:35  <roflmao> not incorrect

2011-11-21T15:25:05  <roflmao> ^^ not nearly as much of a problem in Java as in Python

2011-11-21T15:29:10  <Antimony> Why would anyone use JAva
2011-11-21T15:29:16  <Antimony> C++ is faster and easier

2011-11-21T15:30:17  * avdg1 is getting frustrated by unpredicted behavior of the c++ streams
2011-11-21T15:30:22  <roflmao> diff is minimal for a project like this **** obviously once you get into heavy memory management c++ blows java out of the water because you have control over pointers
2011-11-21T15:30:35  <roflmao> and can do manual garbage collection
2011-11-21T15:30:57  * avdg1 doesn't think pointers are that worst
2011-11-21T15:32:28  <avdg1> and in case we have a language fight: learn to use each others language ;-)

2011-11-21T16:19:55  <McLeopold> ants.issue_order(ant, direction)
2011-11-21T16:20:07  <McLeopold> there is no saved order structure for the python starter

2011-11-21T17:35:06  <mcstar> will expect an integer
2011-11-21T17:35:11  <avdg> yeah
2011-11-21T17:35:23  <mcstar> i.e. a string that is recognizable as an integer number
2011-11-21T17:35:45  <mcstar> so why would you give uchar type to your state variables?
2011-11-21T17:36:24  <avdg> because I was thinking it was acting like an int
2011-11-21T17:36:34  <avdg> but yeah
2011-11-21T17:36:35  <mcstar> and that if/else forest can be thrown out the window too
2011-11-21T17:36:54  <mcstar> you simply dont need it
2011-11-21T17:37:47  <mcstar> avdg: nothing stops you from doing that with scanf or whatver, atoi or something
2011-11-21T17:37:54  <mcstar> but there is no reason to do that

2011-11-21T17:38:26  <mcstar> but pls dont break my bot with looking at it
2011-11-21T17:38:39  <Anilm3> don't worry
2011-11-21T17:40:05  <mcstar> avdg: another advise: use stringstreams
2011-11-21T17:40:28  <mcstar> read in a whole line, and read from that line as a stream with the stream operators
2011-11-21T17:40:38  <mcstar> you have better control over what and how you read

2011-11-21T17:44:40  * BenJackson misreads a replay for a second thinking "how did that ant score 3" and finally realizing that it had 3 ants left
2011-11-21T17:44:54  <avdg> meh lets skip that subject

2011-11-21T17:47:36  <avdg> yeah, most people are sleeping now
2011-11-21T17:47:45  <avdg> its about to get better atm
2011-11-21T17:48:26  <ikaros> anyone knows a bot name which uses heavy swarm behaviour/flocking? (to watch)
2011-11-21T17:48:51  <mcstar> ikaros: the reverse engineer mentality
2011-11-21T17:49:06  <mcstar> dont you want the binary too?
2011-11-21T17:49:09  <Anilm3> does flocking really work well here?
2011-11-21T17:49:16  <ikaros> nah im just a little bored by seeing all the same strategies
2011-11-21T17:49:34  <mcstar> what do you consider flocking?
2011-11-21T17:49:44  <mcstar> cause there are some kind of flocking but thats useless
2011-11-21T17:50:01  <Anilm3> The usual flocking based on boids I suppose
2011-11-21T17:50:06  <mcstar> for example: player notices a hill, drives all ants there
2011-11-21T17:50:09  <mcstar> its flocking but...
2011-11-21T17:50:54  <mcstar> boids are for better resolution space/time
2011-11-21T17:51:04  <mcstar> at least thats what i think
2011-11-21T17:51:14  <Anilm3> what do you mean by resolution?
2011-11-21T17:51:33  <mcstar> well, here, much can happen in 1 turn or 1 tile next
2011-11-21T17:51:40  <BenJackson> my ants flock only because they are mostly all responding to the same stimuli
2011-11-21T17:51:45  <BenJackson> not because they're following each other
2011-11-21T17:51:45  <mcstar> and for boids you need some sort of cntinuity
2011-11-21T17:52:05  <mcstar> BenJackson: yeah, thats what i tried to illustrate
2011-11-21T17:52:10  <mcstar> that isnt really flocking
2011-11-21T17:52:22  <BenJackson> I agree
2011-11-21T17:52:28  <ikaros> sorry had to go afk mcstar yea the classic boids thing
2011-11-21T17:52:30  <Anilm3> BenJackson: so your flocking is an emergent behaviour, that's cool
2011-11-21T17:52:32  <mcstar> its just: same goal+exclusion principle
2011-11-21T17:52:46  <BenJackson> flocking is emergent behavior by a bunch of agents with limited information (ie just about the birds around them)
2011-11-21T17:52:52  <BenJackson> we have global knowledge so it's not likely to be useful
2011-11-21T17:53:06  <Anilm3> I'm trying to achieve that but no luck
2011-11-21T17:53:19  <mcstar> Anilm3: you have to micor-manage
2011-11-21T17:53:24  <mcstar> boids go the opposite way
2011-11-21T17:53:34  <ikaros> i once saw a bot (it was still basic) by a guy from within this channel and it had very nice flocking behaviour
2011-11-21T17:53:54  <deafferret> (very nice flocking)++
2011-11-21T17:54:04  <ikaros> BenJackson, thats just an assumption.. and was my first impression to
2011-11-21T17:54:06  <ikaros> too
2011-11-21T17:54:32  <ikaros> i just cant be sure without trying something like that.. especially because its so much fun :)
2011-11-21T17:54:50  <BenJackson> so competition is clearly picking up
2011-11-21T17:54:57  <mcstar> my take on this: flocking is really an emergent phenomennon
2011-11-21T17:55:03  <BenJackson> as people wrapped up the weekend and made new submissions I slipped about 10 spots
2011-11-21T17:55:05  <mcstar> you can always do better here

2011-11-21T17:55:13  <BenJackson> my bot is over a week old now
2011-11-21T17:55:14  <mcstar> yo dont have to wait for something to show up
2011-11-21T17:55:20  <mcstar> you program in the bhavior
2011-11-21T17:55:26  <BenJackson> mcstar: I agree
2011-11-21T17:55:39  <BenJackson> the alternative is also an interesting challenge but it's not *this* challenge
2011-11-21T17:55:57  <mcstar> its kiind of like with evolutionary approaches
2011-11-21T17:56:19  <BenJackson> many years ago I wrote a program to evolve programs to make ants seek food in a grid world
2011-11-21T17:56:22  <BenJackson> very similar to this
2011-11-21T17:56:30  <BenJackson> except the ants had almost no sensory input
2011-11-21T17:56:33  <mcstar> BenJackson: i saw a java simulation of that
2011-11-21T17:56:42  <mcstar> (or soomething similar)
2011-11-21T17:56:44  <BenJackson> just "is food ahead of me" and if it moved "did I hit a wall"
2011-11-21T17:56:48  <ikaros> well that's still quite different
2011-11-21T17:56:59  <BenJackson> and it evolved programs in a stack language
2011-11-21T17:57:15  <BenJackson> of course in this game you know the exact food and ant location and where the obstacles are and go straight there
2011-11-21T17:57:47  <ikaros> yes but you have to decide how many ants to send at targets and such
2011-11-21T17:58:05  <ikaros> and how do you know if you make good decisions
2011-11-21T17:58:18  <BenJackson> well I'm not trying to evolve anything in THIS challenge
2011-11-21T17:58:28  <BenJackson> so I'd know by watching replays, figuring out why things happened, tweaking the code
2011-11-21T17:58:30  <ikaros> i understood
2011-11-21T17:58:57  <BenJackson> in the genetic programming case the ants had a cost for moving which they replenished by eating
2011-11-21T17:59:03  <BenJackson> and by surviving they produced offspring
2011-11-21T17:59:12  <ikaros> as i said different problem
2011-11-21T17:59:26  <BenJackson> I think there is an interesting meta-ai problem for this contest
2011-11-21T17:59:31  <BenJackson> to write a program to analyze replays
2011-11-21T17:59:34  <ikaros> yea
2011-11-21T17:59:41  <BenJackson> and determine what behaviors given ants have
2011-11-21T17:59:55  <BenJackson> do they appear to have food seeking?  combat?  retained knowledge of enemy hills?
2011-11-21T17:59:56  <mcstar> BenJackson: isnt your bot supposed to do that in-game?
2011-11-21T17:59:57  <ikaros> would i have known of this when the contest was beta i would have tried something like that
2011-11-21T18:00:13  <ikaros> known of the contest
2011-11-21T18:00:31  <BenJackson> mcstar: at the moment I don't actually try to learn anything about my enemies, although I have ideas along that line

2011-11-21T18:01:03  <ikaros> what i dont like about that contest is that alot of maps just suck
2011-11-21T18:01:08  <BenJackson> yesterday and today I fixed most of my combat bugs
2011-11-21T18:01:15  <mcstar> i had the notion of correlating enemies' decisions with the evaluation function i use to resolve a battle
2011-11-21T18:01:23  <mcstar> so later i can adopt to them

2011-11-21T18:01:36  <ikaros> alot of games are lots of random because of hills being so tight
2011-11-21T18:01:54  <BenJackson> ikaros: maybe.  my bot is better than average at multi-hill mazes
2011-11-21T18:02:03  <ikaros> its not multi hill
2011-11-21T18:02:05  <ikaros> what i mean
2011-11-21T18:02:11  <ikaros> thats ok since you have multi hills :)
2011-11-21T18:02:19  <ikaros> if you lose one.. ok
2011-11-21T18:02:40  <BenJackson> oh, the single-hill mazes tend to have defensible hills
2011-11-21T18:02:49  <ikaros> but those random walks where every player has 5-8 ants and the first hills are razed.. its crazy
2011-11-21T18:03:06  <mcstar> ikaros: try making better maps
2011-11-21T18:03:28  <mcstar> am.stan is working on a new map generator i think
2011-11-21T18:03:31  <ikaros> you can decide to leave ants back early to defend hills but that stalls exploration heavily
2011-11-21T18:03:57  <ikaros> well i think for the bad ones it would be sufficent to be larger or have fewer players
2011-11-21T18:04:14  <ikaros> but whatever.. its just nitpicking
2011-11-21T18:04:15  <mcstar> my bot is usually the best food-gatherer in the games, but since it leaves its hill totally unguarded....
2011-11-21T18:04:24  <ikaros> know that problem :)
2011-11-21T18:04:26  <BenJackson> I think the real problem is that despite 'symmetry' any map with >2 players can be highly asymmetric based on player placement

2011-11-21T18:08:24  <BenJackson> my original defense code could have done it easily
2011-11-21T18:08:59  <BenJackson> ikaros: I have a new version that krushes the old version but as long as I know about major bugs I keep not bothering to submit
2011-11-21T18:09:06  <mcstar> someone asked if a human could match against a bot
2011-11-21T18:09:09  <mcstar> well, noway sir
2011-11-21T18:09:46  <ikaros> yea it doesnt help anyways.. testing is better with tcp since the servers are so slow
2011-11-21T18:10:05  <BenJackson> the real problem with aichallenge is that I don't even watch the replays for the most part
2011-11-21T18:10:09  <Minthos> if the human assists an ai, then perhaps
2011-11-21T18:10:11  <BenJackson> that code is so old I don't care why it lost or won
2011-11-21T18:10:33  <Minthos> ai sends ants exploring and handles micro, human makes strategic decisions
2011-11-21T18:10:45  <Minthos> attack here, pull back from here, explore here etc
2011-11-21T18:10:49  <ikaros> look at top starcraft players.. would bet on them :)
2011-11-21T18:11:05  <pairofdice> Some of the starcraft bots are pretty good
2011-11-21T18:11:07  <Minthos> they can't micro 200 ants in 500 ms successfully
2011-11-21T18:11:10  <ikaros> well

2011-11-21T18:13:11  <ikaros> pathfinding is implicit in any strategy game
2011-11-21T18:13:36  <Minthos> right, and so is basic unit micro and many of the things we implement here
2011-11-21T18:14:01  <ikaros> well.. so the player vs bot contest is not well defined :)
2011-11-21T18:14:11  <Minthos> so I'm saying a human couldn't replace an ai in this game without a layer in between

2011-11-21T18:14:29  <Minthos> that implements lots of the stuff we have in our ais
2011-11-21T18:14:56  <Minthos> hard to draw the line between what's a human's responsibility and what's the ai's
2011-11-21T18:14:58  <ikaros> that would be true for almost any RTS
2011-11-21T18:15:08  <ikaros> and 500ms is kinda RTS for a human lol

2011-11-21T18:21:51  <ikaros> btw.. how often is this contest run?
2011-11-21T18:21:54  <McLeopold> amstan: nope
2011-11-21T18:22:07  <ikaros> is there a specific interval
2011-11-21T18:22:09  <amstan> McLeopold: try it, sudo su contest; worker_ssh
2011-11-21T18:22:33  <amstan> ikaros: depends on a lot of things, but mostly how fast we dev
2011-11-21T18:22:42  <ikaros> ok
2011-11-21T18:22:44  <amstan> ikaros: we try to minimize that interval

2011-11-21T18:27:18  <McLeopold> I haven't really looked at your code
2011-11-21T18:27:48  <amstan> you can do stuff like map[Point(10,10)+Point(-1,-20)]=WATER
2011-11-21T18:28:18  <amstan> it handles wrapping, adding values, symmetries
2011-11-21T18:28:26  <BenJackson> does anyone here know how to fix the button sprite sheets?
2011-11-21T18:28:32  <McLeopold> amstan: that's nice

2011-11-21T18:29:19  <mcstar> and a bit more
2011-11-21T18:29:20  <BenJackson> plus you can fight through all those walls

2011-11-21T19:37:44  <mcstar> (im not bragging)
2011-11-21T19:37:48  <thestinger> you should really have -Wall on
2011-11-21T19:37:53  <mcstar> k
2011-11-21T19:38:03  <Antimony> I always use -Wall
2011-11-21T19:38:05  <thestinger> and -Wextra too (shut off individual warnings if they annoy you)
2011-11-21T19:38:07  <Antimony> it's ocassionally helpful
2011-11-21T19:38:10  <thestinger> -Wno-missing-parameter
2011-11-21T19:38:12  <thestinger> etc.
2011-11-21T19:38:20  <mcstar> ill try
2011-11-21T19:38:34  <thestinger> you'll probably get a bunch of warnings with -Wextra since you haven't been using it
2011-11-21T19:38:42  <Antimony> the only warnign that commonly gives me problems is unsigned signed comparison
2011-11-21T19:38:43  <thestinger> everything in -Wall should be fixed
2011-11-21T19:38:46  <mcstar> lets see :D
2011-11-21T19:38:53  <Antimony> its too much work to put in the casts all the tiem
2011-11-21T19:39:06  <thestinger> Antimony: -Wconversion is usually too annoying

2011-11-21T19:40:30  <mcstar> my initilizations dont depend on each other

2011-11-21T19:41:46  <mcstar> i dont see any more
2011-11-21T19:42:21  <mcstar> the unsets are annoying

2011-11-21T19:42:32  <thestinger> well, '-Wall -Wextra' enables a lot of stuff but not all the useful ones
2011-11-21T19:42:38  <mcstar> i just dont always use them since im developing that damn app
2011-11-21T19:43:13  <thestinger> most of them are much more useful in C, if you're heavily using the C++ standard lib you avoid a lot of the issues
2011-11-21T19:43:22  <mcstar> ants.cpp:94:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
2011-11-21T19:43:25  <mcstar> after -Wextra
2011-11-21T19:43:31  <mcstar> this was added only
2011-11-21T19:43:44  <mcstar> i know whats the problem
2011-11-21T19:43:51  <thestinger> if you know it never reaches the end, you can put '__builtin_unreachable()'
2011-11-21T19:43:59  <thestinger> but it's usually a possible edge case
2011-11-21T19:44:05  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-21T19:44:13  <mcstar> it cant really end wo a return
2011-11-21T19:44:19  <mcstar> but the code path is there
2011-11-21T19:44:42  <thestinger> __builtin-unreachable() lets the compiler optimize more (but it's undefined behaviour if it ever reaches there)
2011-11-21T19:44:58  <thestinger> that's a GCC extension, but you can just get rid of them with macros if you want portable code
2011-11-21T19:44:59  <mcstar> where do i put it?
2011-11-21T19:45:12  <thestinger> at the bottom
2011-11-21T19:45:16  <mcstar> (i wont since it doesn matter, not performance critical)
2011-11-21T19:45:40  <mcstar> its in a function i dont even use
2011-11-21T19:45:46  <mcstar> i wrote it up, and forgot abotu it
2011-11-21T19:46:06  <thestinger> -Wshadow is nice, but it doesn't really work in C++
2011-11-21T19:46:11  <thestinger> due to function overloads being okay
2011-11-21T19:46:31  <mcstar> i dont get that
2011-11-21T19:46:37  <mcstar> what does it warn about?
2011-11-21T19:46:45  <thestinger> so if you have a for loop
2011-11-21T19:46:49  <thestinger> with i as the loop control variable
2011-11-21T19:46:55  <thestinger> and then you redefine i in an inner loop
2011-11-21T19:46:59  <thestinger> that's okay, but it will warn you

2011-11-21T19:47:16  <mcstar> ok, i get that
2011-11-21T19:47:19  <thestinger> it makes you use different variable names even though they are scoped basically
2011-11-21T19:47:25  <mcstar> but what does it have to do with function overlaoding?
2011-11-21T19:47:40  <thestinger> in C, it stops you from naming a function "abs" if you're including math.h already
2011-11-21T19:47:53  <thestinger> in C++, you're just making an overload of the function
2011-11-21T19:48:01  <mcstar> aham
2011-11-21T19:48:09  <mcstar> but its in a different namespace too
2011-11-21T19:48:16  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-21T19:48:20  <thestinger> be careful about that though
2011-11-21T19:48:28  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup
2011-11-21T19:49:22  <thestinger> namespaces in C++ are kind of broken, in that you can call 'abs(-5)' when you're including cmath
2011-11-21T19:49:25  <thestinger> even without a using statement
2011-11-21T19:49:33  <thestinger> it will use argument-dependent name lookup
2011-11-21T19:49:37  <thestinger> really bad feature imo
2011-11-21T19:49:50  <mcstar> lol
2011-11-21T19:49:52  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-21T19:49:56  <mcstar> i didint know this
2011-11-21T19:50:02  <antimatroid> meh :P
2011-11-21T19:50:06  <thestinger> it's required for iostream's overload of >> and << to work
2011-11-21T19:50:17  <antimatroid> i love the << and >> syntax :D
2011-11-21T19:50:19  <mcstar> thestinger: i thought friend is for that
2011-11-21T19:50:23  <mcstar> antimatroid: shut up
2011-11-21T19:50:26  <antimatroid> it composes so nicel
2011-11-21T19:50:27  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-21T19:50:30  <antimatroid> never :p;
2011-11-21T19:50:56  <antimatroid> i've never seen a nicer syntax for io in a language
2011-11-21T19:50:56  <thestinger> antimatroid: yeah, but I think that's one area that bjarne views as a mistake
2011-11-21T19:51:07  <antimatroid> because of the implications?
2011-11-21T19:51:09  <antimatroid> it's so nice!
2011-11-21T19:51:11  <thestinger> no
2011-11-21T19:51:18  <antimatroid> why?
2011-11-21T19:51:21  <thestinger> because it's an abuse of operator overloading that they only did as an example
2011-11-21T19:51:26  <thestinger> and it's unsafe
2011-11-21T19:51:29  <thestinger> it can't return an error to you
2011-11-21T19:51:30  <antimatroid> an abuse?
2011-11-21T19:51:37  <thestinger> it can't say "end of file" or "broken pipe"
2011-11-21T19:51:39  <a1k0n> it also frankly sucks compared to printf
2011-11-21T19:51:40  <antimatroid> so?
2011-11-21T19:51:42  <thestinger> it doesn't even throw an exception
2011-11-21T19:51:47  <thestinger> so you can't handle errors properly
2011-11-21T19:51:47  <antimatroid> a1k0n: how? :D
2011-11-21T19:51:49  <antimatroid> :S*
2011-11-21T19:52:00  <thestinger> other languages do IO nicely too
2011-11-21T19:52:02  <thestinger> look at how Go does it
2011-11-21T19:52:03  <mcstar> thestinger: thats why i read into a stringstream
2011-11-21T19:52:20  <a1k0n> i would like << and >> if C++ included a std::string format(fmt, ...)
2011-11-21T19:52:35  <thestinger> print(a, b, c)
2011-11-21T19:52:41  <thestinger> cout << a << b << c << endl;
2011-11-21T19:52:44  <thestinger> why is the 2nd better?
2011-11-21T19:52:52  <thestinger> print can be polymorphic and safe
2011-11-21T19:52:53  <mcstar> cause its chained
2011-11-21T19:53:05  <mcstar> theres a beauty to it
2011-11-21T19:53:08  <a1k0n> you basically can't do the same precision stuff with ios, and even when you can it's retarded
2011-11-21T19:53:12  <mcstar> this pipelining paradigm
2011-11-21T19:53:16  <antimatroid> how would you overload the print function for variable number parameters etc?
2011-11-21T19:53:19  <antimatroid> that's just gross and messy
2011-11-21T19:53:22  <thestinger> no
2011-11-21T19:53:24  <mcstar> a1k0n: thats a pain to set it

2011-11-21T19:53:46  <thestinger> antimatroid: well, haskell also has chaining of I/O like C++
2011-11-21T19:53:59  <thestinger> it looks similar, but you can handle errors properly
2011-11-21T19:54:05  <thestinger> it's a great idea, it just wasn't executed properly
2011-11-21T19:54:10  <thestinger> like std::vector<bool>
2011-11-21T19:54:10  <antimatroid> so the problem is error handling? :P
2011-11-21T19:54:19  <antimatroid> i friggin hate vector<bool>
2011-11-21T19:54:24  <thestinger> they are going to fix it
2011-11-21T19:54:32  <a1k0n> isn't it specialized to a bitset?
2011-11-21T19:54:37  <thestinger> yes, basically
2011-11-21T19:54:40  <mcstar> whats wrong with vector-bool?
2011-11-21T19:54:46  <thestinger> mcstar: it's not a container
2011-11-21T19:54:49  <antimatroid> i can't write a Matrix operator for a vector<vector<bool> thing and have an index function for a Location because you can't return a reference to an element of a vector of bools
2011-11-21T19:54:52  <antimatroid> such a pita
2011-11-21T19:54:52  <thestinger> it doesn't hold bools
2011-11-21T19:55:05  <mcstar> holds ints right?
2011-11-21T19:55:05  <thestinger> it's a heap-allocated bitset that you can resize
2011-11-21T19:55:06  <antimatroid> Matrix struct*
2011-11-21T19:55:11  <mcstar> but has the functinality of bool
2011-11-21T19:55:16  <thestinger> mcstar: no, it compresses them into bitfields basically
2011-11-21T19:55:17  <mcstar> whats wrong there?
2011-11-21T19:55:18  <thestinger> it's slow as hell
2011-11-21T19:55:22  <a1k0n> oh, i see.  it can'gt possibly return a bool&

2011-11-21T19:55:25  <antimatroid> it doesn't let you return references to its elements! that's annoying!
2011-11-21T19:55:33  <mcstar> aham i see
2011-11-21T19:55:33  <thestinger> they made a replacement
2011-11-21T19:55:42  <thestinger> that's also a heap-allocated bitset
2011-11-21T19:55:50  <thestinger> so now there are two things with identical functionality
2011-11-21T19:55:51  <mcstar> use a vector<char>
2011-11-21T19:55:55  <thestinger> so people who need a bitset can use the new one
2011-11-21T19:56:03  <a1k0n> does operator[] return some sort of proxy?
2011-11-21T19:56:04  <thestinger> and in 2015 or something they can make std::vector<bool> a real container
2011-11-21T19:56:22  <mcstar> returns what you tell it to

2011-11-21T19:56:23  <antimatroid> you can still return a reference to a vector of bools so you can still index by [r][c], so i just live with that
2011-11-21T19:56:24  <mcstar> no?
2011-11-21T19:56:38  <antimatroid> but grid[loc.row][loc.col] sucks compared to grid[loc]
2011-11-21T19:56:53  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset they had this before, but it's fixed-size
2011-11-21T19:56:59  <thestinger> so it's not a replacement for std::vector<bool>
2011-11-21T19:57:02  <a1k0n> yeah i end up using operator() for that
2011-11-21T19:57:12  <thestinger> the problem is now people are using it as a space-optimized way to store bits
2011-11-21T19:57:18  <thestinger> so they have to do a really slow transistion
2011-11-21T19:57:18  <antimatroid> a1k0n: http://pastebin.com/F9uJKpGv those are my index operators for my grid
2011-11-21T19:57:19  <mcstar> i dont get this, why do you want to use bool then?

2011-11-21T19:59:08  <thestinger> you can call functions that take 2 arguments as infix
2011-11-21T19:59:17  <thestinger> and you can make them infix by default - so you can make your own operators
2011-11-21T19:59:33  <antimatroid> Antimony: did you turn your grid into a graph?
2011-11-21T19:59:38  <Antimony> no
2011-11-21T19:59:40  <thestinger> mod and rem are functions, but you usually call them like '5 `rem` 3'
2011-11-21T19:59:42  <Antimony> why would I?
2011-11-21T19:59:55  <thestinger> and '5 + 3' is the same as '(+) 5 3'
2011-11-21T19:59:57  <antimatroid> each square in my grid has a vector of land neighbours and a vector of all neighbours
2011-11-21T19:59:59  <thestinger> it's just infix by default

2011-11-21T20:01:41  <thestinger> I really wish other languages let you call any function infix like an operator
2011-11-21T20:01:43  <Antimony> no
2011-11-21T20:01:44  <mcstar> since its always unrolled
2011-11-21T20:01:49  <Antimony> pointer dereferences are expensive
2011-11-21T20:01:59  <antimatroid> i wish languages had operator precedence overloading
2011-11-21T20:02:05  <thestinger> special casing +, -, >>, <<, etc. is stupid
2011-11-21T20:02:06  <mcstar> but i dont have to traverse to avoid water
2011-11-21T20:02:08  <antimatroid> and i wish c++ wasn't so restrictive on what you could overload as an operator
2011-11-21T20:02:15  <Antimony> still, it's only one lookup
2011-11-21T20:02:26  <thestinger> operator overloading is nice, and people wouldn't abuse it if they could make their own operators
2011-11-21T20:02:29  <antimatroid> and i wish you could specify wether an operator is to be in/pre/post fix
2011-11-21T20:02:55  <mcstar> there comes lisp: with macros/functions/reader macros
2011-11-21T20:03:07  <antimatroid> i want to keep the c++ syntax too :P

2011-11-21T20:03:15  <Antimony> I want to keep msot of C++ syntax
2011-11-21T20:03:20  <mcstar> and distinct spaces for variables/function values
2011-11-21T20:03:30  <Antimony> but some things I'd take out
2011-11-21T20:03:53  <thestinger> I like the changes Go makes to the C-style syntax/statements
2011-11-21T20:04:06  <antimatroid> i don't like how messy virtual functions etc. are
2011-11-21T20:04:15  <antimatroid> i have to actually read what the hell they are every time i want to write one
2011-11-21T20:04:15  <thestinger> for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { }
2011-11-21T20:04:19  <antimatroid> cause it's just so messy
2011-11-21T20:04:34  <mcstar> abstract virtuals?
2011-11-21T20:04:36  <Antimony> are you actually using inheritance in your bot?
2011-11-21T20:04:38  <mcstar> they are great
2011-11-21T20:04:46  <antimatroid> no i'm not, i mean in general
2011-11-21T20:04:50  <Antimony> oh ok
2011-11-21T20:04:55  <mcstar> c++ woudl suck oo wise wo them
2011-11-21T20:05:01  <Antimony> it's useful sometimes, but not in a situation like this
2011-11-21T20:05:12  <Antimony> I use them a lot in Pickory, a big game I wrote
2011-11-21T20:05:18  <antimatroid> but also writing multiple say order functions and using those for say a priority queue is also a pita
2011-11-21T20:05:27  <Antimony> definitely
2011-11-21T20:05:32  <antimatroid> it would be cool if i could just pass an operator to the priority queue
2011-11-21T20:05:36  <thestinger> type classes for templates would be so awesome
2011-11-21T20:05:37  <Antimony> my priority queue needs work
2011-11-21T20:05:38  <antimatroid> and that's the order operator
2011-11-21T20:05:44  <antimatroid> i just use the stl one :P
2011-11-21T20:06:00  <Antimony> I couldn't use the stl one because I needed to be able to change keys
2011-11-21T20:06:03  <Antimony> and resort
2011-11-21T20:06:07  <antimatroid> although if you just want to use one type of order function you can just overload operator<

2011-11-21T20:06:40  <thestinger> I think some of the compiler vendors were opposed to implementing it
2011-11-21T20:06:52  <thestinger> (*cough* microsoft)
2011-11-21T20:06:56  <Antimony> is anyone using constraint satisfaction/optimization in their bots?
2011-11-21T20:07:01  <thestinger> gcc actually started to implement it, but I guess they won't now

2011-11-21T20:07:30  <antimatroid> another annoying thing is "priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> >" i would intuitively expect to return the greatest elements with highest priority
2011-11-21T20:07:32  <mcstar> hm, after that*
2011-11-21T20:07:40  <antimatroid> but it orders the vector by greater then returns the last element
2011-11-21T20:07:43  <antimatroid> giving the minimum
2011-11-21T20:07:53  <Antimony> I just made my own prioirty queue class
2011-11-21T20:08:09  <Antimony> it calls std algorithms to maintain the heap
2011-11-21T20:08:41  <thestinger> I'm liking std::array, I'm replacing all my C arrays with it :)
2011-11-21T20:09:10  <antimatroid> i haven't looked at that
2011-11-21T20:09:23  <thestinger> it's a stack allocated, fixed-size array
2011-11-21T20:09:27  <thestinger> so it replaces C arrays
2011-11-21T20:10:00  <thestinger> so you can use a.size()
2011-11-21T20:10:03  <thestinger> which is a constexpr
2011-11-21T20:10:08  <thestinger> it compiles to the same code as a C array
2011-11-21T20:10:24  <thestinger> (I tested that)
2011-11-21T20:10:39  <Antimony> I used boost array a lot in my old game*
2011-11-21T20:10:50  <thestinger> it also doesn't let you use it as a pointer without making it explicit
2011-11-21T20:10:52  <Antimony> I haven't gotten around to figuring out what parts of boost are now tandard
2011-11-21T20:10:56  <Antimony> and which ones are supported in my compiler
2011-11-21T20:11:13  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html
2011-11-21T20:11:20  <thestinger> gcc implements almost all of C++11 now
2011-11-21T20:11:43  <mcstar> yeah, proper arrays
2011-11-21T20:11:46  <thestinger> and libstdc++ seems to have almost all the new stuff (unordered_map, unordered_set, array, etc.)
2011-11-21T20:12:15  <antimatroid> mcstar: i think i got half decent battle code going
2011-11-21T20:12:24  <mcstar> great
2011-11-21T20:12:27  <antimatroid> it sucks other than that and food collecting though
2011-11-21T20:12:43  <antimatroid> i greatly reduced the number of nodes in each tree

2011-11-21T20:12:55  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-21T20:13:08  <mcstar> so it is possible
2011-11-21T20:13:17  <antimatroid> for each partition of the ants i just pick out defensive and offensive moves for my ants and the enemies ants then pick moves based off that 2x2 game
2011-11-21T20:13:27  <Antimony> unfortunately, I'm stuck with gcc 4.4.1

2011-11-21T20:17:34  <Antimony> especially the ones you get from large projects

2011-11-21T20:20:03  <thestinger> it's pretty pointless to use autotools imo
2011-11-21T20:20:06  <Antimony> and then I spent hours reading the documentation for make
2011-11-21T20:20:13  <Antimony> to find out what the stuff in the makefile even meant

2011-11-21T20:29:13  <a1k0n> i had his book, but gave it away as a gift
2011-11-21T20:29:27  <thestinger> you have to really know what you're doing to write fast code in haskell without making it impure
2011-11-21T20:29:31  <antimatroid> that's not so bad then i guess
2011-11-21T20:29:43  <antimatroid> perhaps that's an embarassment for functional programming in general?

2011-11-21T20:30:13  <bmh> nah. I find the trouble with writing fast code in haskell doesn't stem from purity, but from laziness.

2011-11-21T20:32:19  <antimatroid> hmmm i did point out a while ago that you need to give remaining ants time to alter the outcome of the game, i don't know if anyone did anything
2011-11-21T20:32:52  <antimatroid> they seem happy to call the game off as soon as first place is decided, but the overall rankings care about the ordinal ranking of the bots
2011-11-21T20:33:10  <Minthos> not just remaining ants, I was the only one with an ant hill left in the game yet I lost
2011-11-21T20:33:24  <antimatroid> ie. you shouldn't call the game off if a player has taken out 2 enemies and will likely take out the third
2011-11-21T20:33:24  <a1k0n> it's not just first place when it ends early
2011-11-21T20:33:30  <Minthos> if I had gotten time to kill off the enemy ants, I woul have won from bonus points
2011-11-21T20:33:37  <a1k0n> i've seen games at 40 3 3 drag on
2011-11-21T20:34:06  <bmh> perhaps they should adopt something like Go endgame scoring to determine 'dead' ants in those caes

2011-11-21T20:34:33  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are we ever going to fix up when "rank stabilises"? at the moment some games are called off before the ranks have actually been decided
2011-11-21T20:35:45  <Antimony> personally, I think that the penalty for timing out should be abolished as well
2011-11-21T20:36:03  <BenJackson> that fluxid replay sure doesn't seem like "rank stabilized" BUT the reason I think is that hill-less ants are not given further opportunity to cap hills
2011-11-21T20:36:04  <antimatroid> hehe, timing out was qisqualification in tron
2011-11-21T20:36:10  <antimatroid> in planet wars it was an instant loss
2011-11-21T20:36:16  <antimatroid> dis*
2011-11-21T20:36:18  <Antimony> it's practically an instant loss now
2011-11-21T20:36:58  <antimatroid> i don't really have a strong opinion either way tbh
2011-11-21T20:36:59  <Antimony> the problem is that random variations in timing mean you have to be very conservative if you don't want to ever timeout
2011-11-21T20:37:18  <antimatroid> on one side you did timeout, on the other we are running an ai contest not a programming contest
2011-11-21T20:37:30  <antimatroid> really?
2011-11-21T20:37:33  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-21T20:37:34  <antimatroid> i intend to use most of my time
2011-11-21T20:37:39  <antimatroid> and have timeout issues atm
2011-11-21T20:37:42  <Antimony> I've had bots time out when returning 30ms early
2011-11-21T20:37:43  <antimatroid> although mostly on tcp i think
2011-11-21T20:37:57  <thestinger> Antimony: on tcp? that's different
2011-11-21T20:38:01  <Antimony> no local
2011-11-21T20:38:13  <Antimony> I submitted one that returns 25ms early to teh server
2011-11-21T20:38:13  <bmh> What's the point of timing out bots? If a bot misses the deadline, just skip them for the turn.
2011-11-21T20:38:15  <thestinger> are you using a language with garbage collection?
2011-11-21T20:38:16  <Antimony> and it tiemd out twice
2011-11-21T20:38:23  <Antimony> no, C++
2011-11-21T20:38:25  <antimatroid> i wonder if we could get the engine to use an actual turnTime 50ms or so above the one specified
2011-11-21T20:38:26  <BenJackson> Antimony: Have you read the engine code?  It takes something like 10ms per hundred lines of bot outupt
2011-11-21T20:38:27  <Antimony> surely the problesm worse for java

2011-11-21T20:40:13  <Minthos> oh never mind
2011-11-21T20:40:33  <Antimony> you need to return over 30ms early if you want to be safe
2011-11-21T20:40:40  <Minthos> with 300 ants that's still just 30 ms
2011-11-21T20:40:41  <Antimony> it's silly

2011-11-21T20:49:04  <McLeopold> I can't give a good rational explaination, other than due to our cutoff rules, that's where we cutoff
2011-11-21T20:49:06  <antimatroid> i realise we want faster games, but we're basically saying orange played better because it was the last hill white went after?
2011-11-21T20:49:08  <thestinger> meh, then you get a bonus just for having a few cautious ants that survive

2011-11-21T20:49:30  <thestinger> the games could just be allowed to go on longer in the finals when speed won't matter so much
2011-11-21T20:49:49  <BenJackson> I dunno

2011-11-21T20:51:29  <McLeopold> yes, you get a rank bonus if you last longer

2011-11-21T20:52:06  <antimatroid> you get a bonus for lasting longer if no bots can increase in ranking?
2011-11-21T20:52:18  <thestinger> I haven't actually noticed that bonus
2011-11-21T20:52:27  <thestinger> just the lone survivor one
2011-11-21T20:52:29  <antimatroid> which can basically come down to the strongest bot coming after your hill last

2011-11-21T20:52:43  <McLeopold> even though orange could be pushed down in rank, he can't gain, so the game ends
2011-11-21T20:52:44  <antimatroid> it's a kind of implicit bonus
2011-11-21T20:53:13  <antimatroid> thestinger: i would argue that orange should really have equal last ranking in that game, not second
2011-11-21T20:53:13  <McLeopold> the other bots, without hills, lost their ability to extend the game
2011-11-21T20:53:24  <thestinger> ah, cause rank is stabilized and you haven't had the -1 for losing the hill :)
2011-11-21T20:53:41  <thestinger> that's enough reason for me to finally merge in this hill defense branch

2011-11-21T20:55:08  <antimatroid> orange being ranked 2nd is more about luck than skill imo
2011-11-21T20:55:58  <thestinger> if tvtropes didn't exist my bot would be so much better :(
2011-11-21T20:56:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I don't think it was a rush that caused it, white was able to spot blue, but not orange, so I could argue orange did a better job at protection
2011-11-21T20:56:21  <McLeopold> there was plenty of time for white to spot either
2011-11-21T20:56:33  <antimatroid> sure, but i would expect white to spot the closest hills first
2011-11-21T20:56:51  <BenJackson> watches the text scroll of a game go by
2011-11-21T20:56:51  <McLeopold> so, I'm not trying to justify that this is the best way to rank, just that is isn't bad enough to change
2011-11-21T20:56:55  <antimatroid> and probably also take the closest hills first assuming equal skill of opponents
2011-11-21T20:56:58  <BenJackson> I'm always rooting for the little ant counts
2011-11-21T20:57:46  <McLeopold> Someone should build in some suicide code to prevent enemy ants from spotting the hills, and see if they do much better...
2011-11-21T20:58:19  <BenJackson> I've considered how to deny hill visibility

2011-11-21T20:59:04  <thestinger> try looking at his older replays
2011-11-21T20:59:27  <thestinger> he would put ants around his hill to block enemies from getting to it - but he could have put them farther out and blocked viewdistance
2011-11-21T20:59:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: planning on it :P
2011-11-21T20:59:47  <thestinger> I mean around his hill at ~5 radius

2011-11-21T21:01:00  <antimatroid> and add stuff into my outcome order function
2011-11-21T21:01:23  <antimatroid> well, better yet just track which enemies have seen each hill
2011-11-21T21:01:36  <antimatroid> and try to prevent an ant from seeing a hill it hasn't seen yet
2011-11-21T21:01:49  <antimatroid> it's probably pretty safe to assume that any decent bot will track enemy hills outside view

2011-11-21T21:07:40  <bhasker> till the end
2011-11-21T21:07:46  <McLeopold> so nobody cries if they go negative
2011-11-21T21:07:51  <a1k0n> at the end it's the number of hills you own or have captured
2011-11-21T21:08:12  <a1k0n> er i guess not quite
2011-11-21T21:08:15  <bhasker> so ant counts don't matter at all?
2011-11-21T21:08:20  <McLeopold> nope
2011-11-21T21:08:21  <bhasker> only hills?
2011-11-21T21:08:24  <McLeopold> yep
2011-11-21T21:08:28  <bhasker> that makes for a wonky scoring
2011-11-21T21:08:34  <bhasker> a bot that kilsl another hill and then dies
2011-11-21T21:08:40  <bhasker> gets a higher score than a bot that survives?
2011-11-21T21:08:47  <bhasker> but didn't get to kill a hill?
2011-11-21T21:08:52  <McLeopold> because surviving doesn't matter
2011-11-21T21:08:59  <McLeopold> razing hills does
2011-11-21T21:09:01  <a1k0n> that is why my bot is doing relatively well
2011-11-21T21:09:02  <bhasker> that makes no sense in a strategy game
2011-11-21T21:09:17  <bhasker> a survivor should always get a higher score than a dead bot
2011-11-21T21:09:33  <bhasker> if the bot is dumb enough to die
2011-11-21T21:09:48  <bhasker> then makes no sense that a survivor to be penalized
2011-11-21T21:09:51  <McLeopold> but the bot may just be ganed up on
2011-11-21T21:09:58  <bhasker> doesn't make it better?
2011-11-21T21:10:06  <bhasker> any bot can be ganged up on
2011-11-21T21:10:06  <McLeopold> so, survival length isn't always a measure of skill
2011-11-21T21:10:24  <bhasker> but if i end the game with like 30% of surviving ants
2011-11-21T21:10:25  <thestinger> it's a reasonable scoring system
2011-11-21T21:10:33  <bhasker> i should be better than a bot that ends game with like 1
2011-11-21T21:10:42  <bhasker> and probably got lucky enough to raze a hill early on?
2011-11-21T21:10:47  <bhasker> in a kamikaze system
2011-11-21T21:11:03  <McLeopold> all maps are symmetric, kamikaze is a valid strategy
2011-11-21T21:11:38  <bhasker> sigh i guess i will have to rewrite my bot to be a bit more aggressive about attacking hills then
2011-11-21T21:11:50  <bhasker> though i still believe that the scoring is wonky
2011-11-21T21:11:58  *** Euphony <Euphony!1812b80b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.24.18.184.11> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-21T21:12:00  <bhasker> makes sense for the victor but not so for the middle bots
2011-11-21T21:12:13  <bhasker> if i just happen to be a bot who had strong neighbours
2011-11-21T21:12:18  <bhasker> i may never get to kill a hill
2011-11-21T21:12:35  <bhasker> but another one crappier bot might be able to go gaga on a weaker neighbor and then die
2011-11-21T21:12:42  <bhasker> but he will rank higher than my bot
2011-11-21T21:12:43  <BenJackson> huh, I just had a game end at 1000 due to "turn limit reached"
2011-11-21T21:12:52  <BenJackson> I could see "ants not razing hills"
2011-11-21T21:13:38  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.9811 yay for a 1497 turn game >.<
2011-11-21T21:14:12  <bhasker> like in this game
2011-11-21T21:14:13  <bhasker> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.9831
2011-11-21T21:14:20  <BenJackson> holy shit what a wall of red
2011-11-21T21:14:59  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=114044&user=3473
2011-11-21T21:15:06  <BenJackson> did that game really run with a 1000 turn limit?
2011-11-21T21:15:13  <bhasker> i end the game with 21 ants but i end up 6th or something
2011-11-21T21:18:14  <BenJackson> bhasker: so basketball games should be decided by time of posession?
2011-11-21T21:18:44  <bhasker> lets not make comparisons rules are very different.
2011-11-21T21:18:59  <bhasker> in basketball games you are not against 7 different opponents
2011-11-21T21:19:21  <BenJackson> so chess should be decided by the number of pieces left at the end?
2011-11-21T21:19:28  <bhasker> again 1v1
2011-11-21T21:19:51  <thestinger> I don't think RTS-style FFA rules would be very fun

2011-11-21T21:20:02  <thestinger> there's already enough turtling/standoffs
2011-11-21T21:20:03  <bhasker> it is an RTS?
2011-11-21T21:20:06  <bhasker> for most purposes
2011-11-21T21:20:24  <bhasker> and i would be fine with the rules if this was a 1v1
2011-11-21T21:20:27  *** emiel_ <emiel_!~emiel@c80-216-69-72.bredband.comhem.se> has quit IRC (Client Quit)
2011-11-21T21:20:34  <bhasker> this is not a 1v1
2011-11-21T21:20:37  <thestinger> no, but I'm comparing the multiplayer maps to a multiplayer RTS free-for-all
2011-11-21T21:20:42  <thestinger> where the last player standing wins
2011-11-21T21:20:51  <roflmao> this game is very ffa'ey
2011-11-21T21:21:01  <bhasker> yes all the more reason to have a better scoring model
2011-11-21T21:21:03  <roflmao> excessively so, you can get screwed jsut by having the wrong opponent next to you
2011-11-21T21:21:04  <thestinger> so someone can just turtle and survive to the end
2011-11-21T21:21:11  <thestinger> I don't like that for this
2011-11-21T21:21:14  <bhasker> just razing hills is not a very good scoring model
2011-11-21T21:21:29  <thestinger> because combat already ends up creating big stalemates
2011-11-21T21:21:36  <roflmao> maybe next year we will have to program an RTS ai!
2011-11-21T21:21:39  <antimatroid> situation: http://pastebin.com/7J1zr716
2011-11-21T21:21:40  <roflmao> with resource gathering and all :P
2011-11-21T21:21:55  <antimatroid> any of you code code to make your ant try and have the enemy follow you around and take their hill?
2011-11-21T21:22:33  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-21T21:22:58  <thestinger> antimatroid: no, but I've considering pretending enemy attack radius isn't passable when ants are alone
2011-11-21T21:23:03  <antimatroid> well, ignoring that he could probably get you around the edge with that example
2011-11-21T21:23:18  <bhasker> i personally think the current scoring model is rather broken in more than 2 player games
2011-11-21T21:23:20  <thestinger> or just making the cost for going through it really high
2011-11-21T21:23:28  <antimatroid> i run battle code for all ants that might end up in a battle
2011-11-21T21:23:36  <bhasker> if in a 3 player game if 2 players decide to send ants at each other and nothing else
2011-11-21T21:23:41  <bhasker> the third player will lose
2011-11-21T21:23:50  <bhasker> if he doesn't get to either of the hills before the other 2
2011-11-21T21:23:53  <bhasker> makes no sense
2011-11-21T21:23:58  <bhasker> they kamikaze and win
2011-11-21T21:24:07  <bhasker> while the surviving player loses
2011-11-21T21:24:09  <antimatroid> that is a bit weird
2011-11-21T21:24:25  <bmh> increase the 'losing your hill' penalty?
2011-11-21T21:24:31  <bhasker> but he has no choice?
2011-11-21T21:24:36  <bhasker> there are only 2 hills?
2011-11-21T21:24:39  <bhasker> and they killed each other?
2011-11-21T21:24:42  <bhasker> what does he do now?
2011-11-21T21:24:51  <bhasker> there is nothing left to kill
2011-11-21T21:24:51  <thestinger> I think the game just needs to keep going instead of doing rank stabilized in that case
2011-11-21T21:24:55  <roflmao> bhasker: well .. killing hills is important, surviving less.
2011-11-21T21:25:00  <bhasker> but...
2011-11-21T21:25:00  <thestinger> there's a bonus for being the last survivor
2011-11-21T21:25:04  <bhasker> there are none left tokil?
2011-11-21T21:25:05  <bmh> bots can't (lawfully) coordinate. In the top tier games I hope to see all permutations played out.
2011-11-21T21:25:11  <bhasker> i am not saying coordinate
2011-11-21T21:25:16  <antimatroid> thestinger: the game would probably end before the other ants are all dead
2011-11-21T21:25:20  <antimatroid> cause of rank stabilising
2011-11-21T21:25:22  <bhasker> i am just saying that lets say 2 bots were nearby and 3rd was a little further
2011-11-21T21:25:24  <antimatroid> otherwise yeah it'd be a draw
2011-11-21T21:25:25  <McLeopold> bhasker: the 3 player scenario you described is a bug :(
2011-11-21T21:25:26  <bhasker> so ...
2011-11-21T21:25:35  <bhasker> mcleopold it can happen with more than 3 too
2011-11-21T21:25:38  <bhasker> it can happen with 5
2011-11-21T21:25:42  <bhasker> it can happen with 7
2011-11-21T21:25:46  <bhasker> any odd number
2011-11-21T21:25:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold: if you gave the last bot with hill the lone surviving bonus it'd be a draw?
2011-11-21T21:25:51  <bhasker> of players in a game
2011-11-21T21:25:52  <bmh> it can happen with *any* number
2011-11-21T21:26:04  <bhasker> with even numbers with symmetrical maps less so
2011-11-21T21:26:06  <bmh> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A, F is left out in the cold.
2011-11-21T21:26:11  <thestinger> bhasker: so you need to make your bot willing to rush at hills on the small maps
2011-11-21T21:26:17  <bhasker> thats not the point
2011-11-21T21:26:19  <thestinger> it's part of the challenge - balancing offense and defense
2011-11-21T21:26:21  <bhasker> the scoring model is broken
2011-11-21T21:26:26  <bhasker> i could lose even if i did the best thing
2011-11-21T21:26:39  <bhasker> thats where my problem is
2011-11-21T21:26:40  <bmh> but you didn't do the *best* thing
2011-11-21T21:26:41  <thestinger> the best thing would be to ninja both their hills as they fight each other
2011-11-21T21:26:45  <bhasker> in a 3 player game
2011-11-21T21:26:50  <bhasker> if i am a little further away
2011-11-21T21:26:54  <thestinger> you aren't
2011-11-21T21:26:55  <bhasker> i will lose always
2011-11-21T21:26:56  <thestinger> it's symmetrical
2011-11-21T21:27:06  <bhasker> distances to every player to each other are not
2011-11-21T21:27:06  <antimatroid> bhasker: i guess some rational could be that you need to get involved in the game
2011-11-21T21:27:21  <antimatroid> those two ants got engaged into battle and killed each other while you were still sitting about setting up or something
2011-11-21T21:27:35  <bhasker> yes but …does that mean my bot is worse?
2011-11-21T21:27:37  <thestinger> yeah, if they're busy fighting each other they have their hills exposed
2011-11-21T21:27:43  <antimatroid> but it makes no sense when you turn around and look at it from the point of view that you now have a hill and the entire world to yourself pretty much
2011-11-21T21:27:55  <antimatroid> thestinger: they take out each others hills
2011-11-21T21:27:58  <bhasker> this scoring model only rewards one strategy
2011-11-21T21:28:05  <thestinger> antimatroid: ah
2011-11-21T21:28:06  <bhasker> in an RTS multiple strategies should be alowed
2011-11-21T21:28:17  <McLeopold> bhasker: the scoring model is broken according to *your* perspective of what the game should be, it is not actually broken
2011-11-21T21:28:32  <McLeopold> the game isn't what you want it to be, it is what it is
2011-11-21T21:28:33  <thestinger> you can do an early rush and then turtle
2011-11-21T21:28:38  <thestinger> there are many valid strategies
2011-11-21T21:28:40  <antimatroid> the game is geared towards faster games
2011-11-21T21:28:49  <bhasker> why not make the hills respawn?
2011-11-21T21:28:49  <thestinger> protecting your hill is worth it, but you need to take risks
2011-11-21T21:28:51  <antimatroid> it just isn't feasible otherwise with the number of competitors
2011-11-21T21:28:53  <bhasker> that would solve the problem
2011-11-21T21:28:59  <roflmao> while I'd love to see more tactical variety in this game, I think adding that tactical variety would make the programming a lot harder.
2011-11-21T21:29:03  <antimatroid> respawn hills?
2011-11-21T21:29:21  <thestinger> strcat_camping :)
2011-11-21T21:29:22  <McLeopold> hills don't respawn because then the games would take longer
2011-11-21T21:29:24  <bhasker> yes if they get razed after a few turns if no enemy ants are nearby respawn?
2011-11-21T21:29:31  <bhasker> no ants rather
2011-11-21T21:29:34  <bhasker> or add neutral hills
2011-11-21T21:29:38  <bhasker> that can be taken over
2011-11-21T21:29:42  <roflmao> neutral hills would be fun
2011-11-21T21:29:54  <bhasker> by competing bots and converted
2011-11-21T21:29:55  <antimatroid> neutral hills would be like planet wars a bit
2011-11-21T21:30:02  <bmh> All of the server code is out there. If people feel like playing this game, with a different scoring model, after the competition is over no one is going to stop them
2011-11-21T21:30:02  <antimatroid> and also leads to longer games
2011-11-21T21:30:17  <thestinger> capturing hills instead of destroying them would be an interesting twist
2011-11-21T21:30:23  <thestinger> I'd like to see someone run a tcp server like that
2011-11-21T21:30:50  <roflmao> yeah that would be loads fo fun
2011-11-21T21:30:50  <bhasker> anyway i guess its too late to argue about the scoring model but it does seem a bit unfair in more than 2 player games
2011-11-21T21:30:50  <bmh> is it possible to take a hill that is producing ants?
2011-11-21T21:30:51  <antimatroid> if people are swapping ownership of hills the games could take ages
2011-11-21T21:30:59  <roflmao> but would require changing bot logic
2011-11-21T21:31:01  <thestinger> bmh: if they move off the hill right away, yes
2011-11-21T21:31:05  <antimatroid> bmh: no
2011-11-21T21:31:17  <roflmao> animatroid: it could be a one time take thing
2011-11-21T21:31:19  <antimatroid> well, if they move off and you kill that ant sure
2011-11-21T21:31:27  <roflmao> you take it and its yours, if someone destroys it it is gone forever
2011-11-21T21:31:29  <antimatroid> but ants spawn between moves and battle resolution yeah?
2011-11-21T21:31:33  <thestinger> I have code to figure out whether they are staying on their hill or moving off
2011-11-21T21:31:37  <antimatroid> so if the hive has enough ants there then no?
2011-11-21T21:31:44  <thestinger> antimatroid: no, you can move them the turn they spawn
2011-11-21T21:31:46  <roflmao> you could do tons of cool additions to this game
2011-11-21T21:31:53  <roflmao> add forts on map that give tactical advantages
2011-11-21T21:31:59  <thestinger> antimatroid: you can take a hill with 300+ ants ready to spawn if they don't stay on it when they spawn
2011-11-21T21:32:01  <roflmao> add different ant personalities
2011-11-21T21:32:01  <antimatroid> yes, but then after it moves doesn't another ant spawn there before battle code is run?
2011-11-21T21:32:04  <roflmao> but the more you add the harder it gets
2011-11-21T21:32:07  <thestinger> antimatroid: nope
2011-11-21T21:32:14  <thestinger> I had to write code to deal with it
2011-11-21T21:32:20  <antimatroid> i thought that was the case :\
2011-11-21T21:32:24  <thestinger> because if you surround their hill
2011-11-21T21:32:28  <thestinger> and they are really moving off it right away
2011-11-21T21:32:31  <thestinger> they are colliding with you
2011-11-21T21:32:42  <thestinger> and it's just as bad as trying to take the hill while ants are spawning
2011-11-21T21:32:44  <McLeopold> if a hills is spawning ants, it can't be razed
2011-11-21T21:32:48  <antimatroid> so new ants spawn after battle code is run?
2011-11-21T21:32:55  *** b0rder <b0rder!~b0rder@114.246.78.82> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-21T21:32:58  <McLeopold> a valid defense is gathering >= 1 food per turn
2011-11-21T21:33:14  <thestinger> I can make an example scenario and paste it
2011-11-21T21:33:18  <antimatroid> McLeopold: this is right yeah, ants move, ants spawn, ants collide, ants battle?
2011-11-21T21:33:58  <McLeopold> http://aichallenge.org/problem_description.php move -> attack -> raze -> gather -> spawn
2011-11-21T21:34:12  <antimatroid> then you can lose your hill
2011-11-21T21:34:25  <thestinger> yeah, so the next turn you can move the ant that spawned off your hill
2011-11-21T21:34:29  <thestinger> and an enemy can move there at the same time
2011-11-21T21:34:41  <antimatroid> if you move the spawned ant off the hill then the hill can be razed before the next ant spawns
2011-11-21T21:34:43  <thestinger> you have to choose to sacrifice your hill, but lots of bots do it
2011-11-21T21:34:56  <antimatroid> my battle code wont give the hill up
2011-11-21T21:35:17  <antimatroid> an enemy razing my hills is the worst possible outcome
2011-11-21T21:35:20  <antimatroid> according to my bot
2011-11-21T21:35:28  <antimatroid> followed by an enemy razing an enemy hill
2011-11-21T21:36:56  <antimatroid> crud, i guess enemies can be adjacent to your friends too
2011-11-21T21:37:00  <bmh> antimatroid: I was thinking of counting the number of enemy ants seen and if my bot believes defeat is inevitable, give up my hill to the lesser bot
2011-11-21T21:37:04  <antimatroid> i think i made the assumption that they couldn't
2011-11-21T21:38:04  <antimatroid> if it went move, spawn, collide, battle then it would be impossible for bots to ever see enemy ants adjacent
2011-11-21T21:38:29  <antimatroid> and would make it more worthwhile for people to track the size of their hive
2011-11-21T21:39:11  <McLeopold> no, if a hills is spawning ants, it can't be razed
2011-11-21T21:39:32  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yes it can :P
2011-11-21T21:40:57  <antimatroid> you need to do spawning between moves and collisions if you want it to be impossible to raze hills while the hive has ants
2011-11-21T21:41:17  <antimatroid> but it's not hard to make sure your hill can't be razed while you have a hive going on
2011-11-21T21:43:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: do you see why? if you move the newly spawned ant off and killed in battle, then an enemy can step onto your hill and raze it before another ant spawns

2011-11-21T21:45:31  <thestinger> I use dead ants to figure out if they're moving off or not
2011-11-21T21:45:42  <antimatroid> yeah i figured as much
2011-11-21T21:45:50  <antimatroid> but then you also need to go right move onto the hill you stupid bot
2011-11-21T21:46:22  <antimatroid> normally my battle code will assume they'll stay put and presumably just use ants in other locations to take them out while they spawn
2011-11-21T21:46:32  <antimatroid> but you need to get the bot to get the razing over and done with when possible
2011-11-21T21:49:59  <thestinger> McLeopold: http://paste.aichallenge.org/xOTnq/
2011-11-21T21:51:01  <thestinger> my bot knows they are moving off because there aren't any dead ants in the hill tile
2011-11-21T21:51:27  <thestinger> if I just waited next to the hill, they could collide into my ants
2011-11-21T21:51:47  <thestinger> a smart bot could try to trick me by alternating, but that's just the same result as if they moved off every turn and I didn't deal with this

2011-11-21T21:52:01  <thestinger> (a collision each turn until the hill is empty)
2011-11-21T21:52:41  <thestinger> and that would be too risky for a good bot to do
2011-11-21T21:53:20  <thestinger> because lots of bots just try moving onto the hill no matter what (and others wait until it drains)
2011-11-21T21:53:51  <thestinger> it was a stupid little thing to think about but I think my solution to the problem is fine :)
2011-11-21T21:55:27  <thestinger> if they just stay on their hill, I do the standard wait til it drains http://paste.aichallenge.org/19rWQ/
2011-11-21T21:55:52  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ok, if you don't want the hill to be razed, you can prevent it by not stepping off

2011-11-21T21:56:37  <antimatroid> well, not a "problem"
2011-11-21T21:56:44  <antimatroid> just something that bot writers need to consider
2011-11-21T21:57:05  <bmh> McLeopold: Of course you run the risk of not stepping off your hill and losing in the natural course of things due to not producing ants :)
2011-11-21T21:57:25  <antimatroid> bmh: depends on how many ants they have :P
2011-11-21T21:57:42  <thestinger> if the enemy isn't right next to your hill you probably want to step off

2011-11-21T22:06:10  <thestinger> it's 2 weeks old
2011-11-21T22:06:26  <thestinger> it gets crushed in a match with my new versions :)
2011-11-21T22:06:36  <thestinger> I think it will drop down to around rank 50 now
2011-11-21T22:06:39  <thestinger> I'll reupload soon
2011-11-21T22:06:47  <bmh> perhaps I should submit the diffusion bot we had working. It's truly terrible. Loses to HunterBot on open maps.
2011-11-21T22:06:50  <thestinger> I was really surprised that it made it up to rank 15 like that though
2011-11-21T22:07:00  <thestinger> just by rushing early on
2011-11-21T22:08:20  <thestinger> my old version on the site just tries to pathfind around ants (diffusion I guess, but it was really primitive and broken)
2011-11-21T22:09:07  <thestinger> sometimes that makes it strafe around an enemy, but it's usually a negative thing when it comes to combat (it will turn a favourable 2v1 or 3v1 into 1v1, etc.)
2011-11-21T22:09:26  <bmh> I did realize that if you spot an enemy ant on the nth turn you know that their hill is within n steps of that point.

2011-11-21T23:14:30  <antimatroid> what do you do for hill defense?
2011-11-21T23:14:43  <a1k0n> nothing special, just try to keep at least one and closer to the hill than any enemy ants
2011-11-21T23:14:44  <avdg> run away :p
2011-11-21T23:14:44  <bmh> antimatroid: a1k0n casts bones.

2011-11-21T23:15:18  <a1k0n> but yes, bone-casting is somewhat involved so it's possible i rolled a critical miss
2011-11-21T23:15:37  <antimatroid> i was thinking of for any enemy ants within x distance of the hill make sure there is a unique friend that can get to my hill as fast as they could
2011-11-21T23:16:03  <antimatroid> then possibly even trying to get them to meet them as soon as possible on one of the enemies shortest paths to my hill
2011-11-21T23:16:15  <antimatroid> you only need them to be able to get within the battle radius too really
2011-11-21T23:16:24  <antimatroid> not necessarily the hill at the same time
2011-11-21T23:16:27  <a1k0n> we should modify truskill to infer a sigma factor for each map
2011-11-21T23:16:44  <antimatroid> people wanted to evaluate the fairness of maps
2011-11-21T23:16:51  <antimatroid> but imo that's just getting ridiculously messy
2011-11-21T23:16:55  <a1k0n> i think they're all *fair*
2011-11-21T23:17:05  <a1k0n> some are just more noisy than others
2011-11-21T23:17:07  <antimatroid> yeah this was back when people wanted asymmetric maps
2011-11-21T23:17:22  <antimatroid> and they're not all fair when you drop the assumption of equally skilled opponents
2011-11-21T23:17:44  <antimatroid> because you don't have symmetrically equal access to each of your enemies
2011-11-21T23:17:51  <a1k0n> true, yes
2011-11-21T23:18:08  <antimatroid> you can get that for 5 players on the surface of a continuous torus
2011-11-21T23:18:13  <antimatroid> not sure about discrete
2011-11-21T23:18:17  <antimatroid> 3 is obviously easy

2011-11-21T23:18:36  <bmh> in the finals it seems that they should run all permutations.
2011-11-21T23:18:49  <antimatroid> yeah you wont get 4
2011-11-21T23:19:18  <antimatroid> but you can tile the torus with 5 "squares" where each oppoent is an adjacent square
2011-11-21T23:19:39  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if you can get it to match up properly in the discrete case, someone on #math pointed out the 5 player case to me

2011-11-21T23:22:10  <bmh> Does skill have a unit?
2011-11-21T23:22:22  <antimatroid> and new maps are generated after entries close for the final contest too
2011-11-21T23:22:25  <antimatroid> what do you mean?

2011-11-21T23:24:14  <antimatroid> all i know is trueskill is somewhat like elo but allows us to rank n-player games :P
2011-11-21T23:24:30  <antimatroid> and that we're only considering the ordinal rankings in each game for the overall rankings
2011-11-21T23:24:57  <antimatroid> which is good because then it's score system independent
2011-11-21T23:25:07  <antimatroid> well, assuming score system is ordinally equivalent
2011-11-21T23:25:47  <antimatroid> i really hate that the euclidean and manhatten metrics aren't equivalent :P

2011-11-21T23:27:23  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-11-21T23:27:30  <antimatroid> we want to rewrite the entire contest stuff
2011-11-21T23:27:34  <bmh> A problem
2011-11-21T23:27:41  <antimatroid> i don't think we could bear to just do it on the existing codebase
2011-11-21T23:27:58  <antimatroid> there have been a few game ideas thrown around in the forums
2011-11-21T23:28:42  <antimatroid> what we ideally want is a site that can handle multiple pages and official tcp pages
2011-11-21T23:28:57  <antimatroid> then there could be tcp servers going to heaps of different games
2011-11-21T23:29:12  <antimatroid> i really really look forward to writing a tron bot again

2011-11-21T23:49:23  <bmh> It's a shame bots don't get the names of their opponents
2011-11-21T23:49:28  <thestinger> strcat was taken on youtube so I used strlcat
2011-11-21T23:49:34  <bmh> then I could be "DROP * FROM ANTS;"
2011-11-21T23:51:04  <BenJackson> you do at the end
2011-11-21T23:52:01  <thestinger> meh, I'll have to make my foragers cautious
2011-11-21T23:52:16  <thestinger> I like aggressive foragers on 2-player maps though
2011-11-21T23:53:48  <thestinger> I guess I can count opponents as I see them...
