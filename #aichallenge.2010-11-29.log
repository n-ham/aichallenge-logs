2010-11-29T00:05:55  <janzert> ok, the raw game result data as fed to bayeselo is available at http://ai-contest.com/ranking-data
2010-11-29T00:06:15  <janzert> it currently has the data from the last day of competition through the present
2010-11-29T00:07:04  <janzert> this is likely to change though with more spread out data from the open competition

2010-11-29T00:48:15  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3905), Accoun(3805), _iouri_(3791), _Astek_(3785), GreenTea(3771), Slin-.-(3769), protocolocon(3767), george(3764), jimrogerz(3759), shangas(3699)
2010-11-29T00:50:16  <CryBaby> Ken69267: I've had some like that.
2010-11-29T00:50:43  <CryBaby> I don't know what good those maps are that have the starting planets so close.
2010-11-29T00:55:09  <burny> so bocs is dominating so far?
2010-11-29T00:55:21  <rabidus_> but there is 5 and 7 ship planets
2010-11-29T00:55:24  <rabidus_> *are
2010-11-29T00:55:50  <burny> you can send up to 20 ships off..
2010-11-29T00:55:55  <burny> cap one of the 5's
2010-11-29T00:56:10  <burny> then spread out if they don't attack quickly
2010-11-29T00:56:15  <burny> then come backand squish
2010-11-29T00:56:58  <burny> also if you were to counter attack with 20, you would probably win
2010-11-29T00:57:42  <rabidus_> yep, that's not that bad map
2010-11-29T00:58:06  <burny> ya, it has an obvious first move..
2010-11-29T00:58:24  <burny> but then has a variety of moves for after the second-base is established
2010-11-29T00:58:53  <CryBaby> (counter attack) if it takes 4 moves to go between the two 5-growth planets, the countered planet has time to build up defense
2010-11-29T00:59:11  <burny> only has tie if they stopa ttacking
2010-11-29T00:59:15  <burny> if they keep sending 5, they lose
2010-11-29T00:59:19  <CryBaby> i see what you mean about the smaller planets, though

2010-11-29T01:19:03  <davidjliu> aw, that was an ignoble victory
2010-11-29T01:19:49  <davidjliu> wasn't I about to take your homebase though, it seems?
2010-11-29T01:20:25  <davidjliu> heh, jk perhaps
2010-11-29T01:20:43  <antimatroid> yep, you probably had me anyway
2010-11-29T01:20:52  <antimatroid> that's my biggest floor, it doesn't necessarily leave anything anywhere
2010-11-29T01:21:00  <antimatroid> i couldn't get that working properly
2010-11-29T01:21:15  <antimatroid> there's also the fact that the tree is just completely broken, but that's alright cause it seems to work
2010-11-29T01:21:19  <antimatroid> it's a character building bug :)

2010-11-29T01:22:11  <burny> boo, I'm out of hte top70 now ;(
2010-11-29T01:22:16  <davidjliu> but it doesn't look like your base is safe...
2010-11-29T01:23:22  <antimatroid> davidjliu: yeah, my bot throws lots of games like that
2010-11-29T01:23:30  <antimatroid> it wasn't something i could fix without the cards tumbling
2010-11-29T01:24:15  <burny> mine seems to be entirely too stupid to possibly be in teh top 100
2010-11-29T01:24:30  <burny> no clue how I managed to get lucky enough to be in top20 for awhile
2010-11-29T01:27:28  <davidjliu> antimatroid: aw, you broke our symmetry on turn 7. It was pretty nice up till then
2010-11-29T01:27:39  <davidjliu> or maybe I broke our symmetry

2010-11-29T01:48:28  <antimatroid> it's a plague
2010-11-29T01:48:57  <medrimonia1> I don't sleep a lot, but it's still too much and not enough^^
2010-11-29T01:49:29  <antimatroid> i have been so sleep deprived the last few months
2010-11-29T01:49:38  <antimatroid> it wasn't so bad once uni finished and i could sleep in
2010-11-29T01:49:49  <antimatroid> i was going to bed at liike 5 some nights and making it to class at 9
2010-11-29T01:51:42  <medrimonia1> I don't when my bot will stop falling in the rankings...
2010-11-29T01:53:30  <antimatroid> i love how competitive the top 2-50 is
2010-11-29T01:57:01  <burny> duno how my bot is still in the top100 with like.. 5/40 wins lately
2010-11-29T01:58:31  <burny> sigh.. every loss I've watched now, is still the same stupid missing feature
2010-11-29T01:58:38  <burny> er.. one of 2 features rathe
2010-11-29T01:58:39  <medrimonia1> I've had such a good start that I was even hoping to be in top 10
2010-11-29T01:58:58  <burny> although, could probably get away with only implementing one of the 2
2010-11-29T01:59:13  <antimatroid> i want top 30 now
2010-11-29T01:59:40  <medrimonia1> now, I hope top 30 and I'm not sure at all
2010-11-29T02:01:30  <antimatroid> yeah neither
2010-11-29T02:01:34  <antimatroid> i've had a couple of crashes

2010-11-29T02:06:07  <antimatroid> ha, that's going to take a while
2010-11-29T02:06:19  <medrimonia> rebelxt_: Try mine after please =P
2010-11-29T02:06:21  <antimatroid> i not once ran any tests over large sets of maps
2010-11-29T02:07:31  <rebelxt_> medrimonia: sure will do. you get higher priority since your bot is faster than antima's ;-)
2010-11-29T02:07:54  <medrimonia> My bot is fast but I should have used more time...
2010-11-29T02:07:59  <antimatroid> smiley is only in 81st place
2010-11-29T02:08:04  <antimatroid> i expected him to be higher

2010-11-29T02:08:44  <medrimonia> I was expecting a lot of people to be higher^^
2010-11-29T02:08:47  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: smiley and i were very nicely matched on tcp last few days.. 50-50
2010-11-29T02:08:52  <antimatroid> i foresee lots of testing in my future for that
2010-11-29T02:09:12  <antimatroid> i think i could make my bot a lot better with like 30 minutes work
2010-11-29T02:09:23  <antimatroid> revelxt_: would you be interested in running that if i fixed it up a bit?
2010-11-29T02:09:33  <rebelxt_> sure
2010-11-29T02:09:35  <antimatroid> i'd be curious to see if it was heaps better/about the same/worse
2010-11-29T02:10:48  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: i was also curious to try giving your bot like 10 seconds per turn and see if it could win some games it lost
2010-11-29T02:11:50  <antimatroid> rebelxt_: i'd need to change numbers inside the program for you

2010-11-29T02:29:36  <medrimonia> I hope new maps will help me
2010-11-29T02:31:00  <rebelxt_> yep it sure does look like it. i'm running a tournament with antimatroid, bhasker, e323, iouri, and mistmanov. will be able to tell which bot should profit from 2nd set of maps the most

2010-11-29T02:31:31  <medrimonia> how do you run this kind of tournament?

2010-11-29T03:41:41  <smloh1> your bot's been doing pretty damn well!
2010-11-29T03:41:52  <antimatroid> yeah, it should be doing that well
2010-11-29T03:41:58  <antimatroid> i keep waiting for it to plumet
2010-11-29T03:42:07  <antimatroid> shouldn't* hehe
2010-11-29T03:42:16  <smloh1> i've been chasing behind you for a bit and just finally caught up
2010-11-29T03:42:37  <smloh1> looks like your bot also has that secret function i put in my bot...
2010-11-29T03:42:45  <antimatroid> what secret function?
2010-11-29T03:42:48  <smloh1> function PrayForLuck()
2010-11-29T03:42:56  <antimatroid> ahh
2010-11-29T03:43:21  <antimatroid> do you actually have such a function? as in i'm losing go for it?
2010-11-29T03:43:29  <antimatroid> i don't, that's just my game tree being itself :s
2010-11-29T03:43:56  <smloh1> lol, no, i meant luck in terms of getting good maps
2010-11-29T03:44:01  <antimatroid> damn, i got another loss
2010-11-29T03:44:03  <antimatroid> to slin
2010-11-29T03:44:31  <smloh1> my bot doesn't keep track of whether it's winning or losing

2010-11-29T03:44:46  <antimatroid> of my last 4 pairings, i've had bix0r, astek and slin

2010-11-29T03:47:04  <smloh1> my bot has a problematic reinforcement routine
2010-11-29T03:47:20  <smloh1> sometimes it'll bounce ships around
2010-11-29T03:47:49  <antimatroid> yeah, i send up to 4 times the planets growth to the closest friend less than the sources closest friend that minines dist[source][redist] + dist[redist][redist.closestenemy]

2010-11-29T03:48:54  <smloh1> ah.. i have a somewhat complex value function check that might cause some flipping situations

2010-11-29T03:51:08  <smloh1> hmm i see so you basically reinforce towards closest enemy
2010-11-29T03:51:24  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-29T03:51:40  <antimatroid> i tend to think it's better to have your ships at the front line
2010-11-29T03:51:48  <antimatroid> you can normally defend the back line from there anyway
2010-11-29T03:52:05  <smloh1> how about expansion though?
2010-11-29T03:52:19  <antimatroid> i wont redistribute until like turn 5 or so i think
2010-11-29T03:52:22  <smloh1> when you still have neutrals behind the frontline
2010-11-29T03:52:38  <antimatroid> and then if it's planning to take neutrals, ships are left for that
2010-11-29T03:52:44  <antimatroid> otherwise it just waits till later to expand
2010-11-29T03:52:52  <antimatroid> but often there's planets near the centre to fight over anyway
2010-11-29T03:53:31  <smloh1> yeah, it's just, when you have a stalemate sometimes if you aggregate some ships further back they can safely capture a neutral and tilt the balance
2010-11-29T03:54:00  <antimatroid> sometimes it works the other way too :P
2010-11-29T03:54:19  <smloh1> ah yes, i have plenty of losses to prove that
2010-11-29T03:55:19  <smloh1> it's amazing how addictive it is, refreshing a webpage to see the progress of something you no longer even have any ability to influence
2010-11-29T03:55:25  <antimatroid> i want another game to play now
2010-11-29T03:55:29  <antimatroid> i'm looking at arimaa
2010-11-29T03:55:40  <antimatroid> but i don't really know how to do anything good with that number of moves available
2010-11-29T03:56:25  <smloh1> ah i will keep myself safely away from another timesink, for now...
2010-11-29T03:58:58  <antimatroid> hehe, it is certainly just that
2010-11-29T03:59:13  <antimatroid> but only because it's so much fun :P
2010-11-29T03:59:40  <smloh1> arimaa huh...
2010-11-29T04:00:05  <antimatroid> there's lots of moves :|
2010-11-29T04:07:29  <janzert> The pairing cutoff or perhaps more ominously although slightly less accurately, the elimination cutoff has begun its slow march up the ranks ;)
2010-11-29T04:09:33  <antimatroid> janzert:  :)
2010-11-29T04:09:34  <smloh1> 4613? that's the number minus crashbots?
2010-11-29T04:10:20  <janzert> smloh1: no that's the current cutoff it just started at 4619 and is currently headed for 4540
2010-11-29T04:10:37  <smloh1> oh so it's a slow progression
2010-11-29T04:10:52  <janzert> right "slow march" and all that
2010-11-29T04:11:01  <smloh1> makes sense, more systematic than manually identifying cutoff points
2010-11-29T04:11:38  <smloh1> ah those are some exciting matches down at the bottom :P

2010-11-29T04:14:07  <janzert> maybe reverse dueling
2010-11-29T04:16:35  <smloh1> interesting, bots that always crash have ELO ranging from 0 all the way to 16
2010-11-29T04:16:53  <sigh> lowest elo is anchored at 0
2010-11-29T04:17:58  <sigh> I guess some have higher scores because they lost to better players :P
2010-11-29T04:19:14  <smloh1> yes that looks like it, since the higher score ones actually seem to have more losses
2010-11-29T04:21:37  <janzert> yeah, of course in the limit they would all go to zero but with the limited games bayeselo can't tell that
2010-11-29T04:22:31  <janzert> and actually only 16 elo is a pretty small spread already so it would probably take a *lot* more games to push them right together
2010-11-29T04:23:57  <sigh> how fast is the cutoff changing?
2010-11-29T04:24:32  <janzert> approximately 1 rank per minute
2010-11-29T04:25:17  <janzert> it will stop at 4540 at 4:30 server time
2010-11-29T04:25:18  <sigh> so you want it to reach 1 at the end of the final?

2010-11-29T05:01:16  <mega1_> bix0r is slowly gaining ground
2010-11-29T05:01:26  <mega1_> still much lower than expected
2010-11-29T05:03:47  <smloh1> ranking changes are getting slower and slower
2010-11-29T05:04:12  <janzert> looks like bix0r is vulnerable to sniping and it's giving him losses to lower ranked players than you would otherwise expect?
2010-11-29T05:04:53  <mega1_> he must have made a mistake on the last day
2010-11-29T05:05:11  <mega1_> his previous entries were very solid
2010-11-29T05:05:39  <janzert> at least just looking at his last three losses they all looked like they were due to getting sniped
2010-11-29T05:05:41  <mega1_> much like Slin now
2010-11-29T05:06:38  <GreenTea> pairing cutoff is 4562
2010-11-29T05:07:10  <GreenTea> meas that players bellow 4562 place are not played now?
2010-11-29T05:07:24  <janzert> right
2010-11-29T05:07:32  <mega1_> the one against davidjliu is a lost opening
2010-11-29T05:07:52  <janzert> look at discussion from around a half hour ago though, it's gradually making its way up to 4550
2010-11-29T05:08:19  <janzert> err, 4540
2010-11-29T05:08:46  <mega1_> the one against neverstu: took a small growth 69 and gave up a high growth 68
2010-11-29T05:09:21  <mega1_> and he was sniped by darkemi.
2010-11-29T05:09:23  <janzert> mega1_: oops the neverstu one wasn't there yet and I didn't look at the davidjliu game
2010-11-29T05:09:40  <mega1_> In all three games he was outwaited.
2010-11-29T05:09:49  <janzert> DarkEmi, wagstaff and thdreamer were the ones I looked at
2010-11-29T05:10:41  <Error323> yeeeeehaw i'm still rising
2010-11-29T05:10:42  <GreenTea> "<mega1_> the one against neverstu: took a small growth 69 and gave up a high growth 68" yes. Winner will be bot which makes less mistakes)
2010-11-29T05:10:46  <Error323> 70 now
2010-11-29T05:11:19  <mega1_> GreenTea: sure.
2010-11-29T05:12:35  <mega1_> so he's being sniped from one point of view or outwaited from an another.
2010-11-29T05:12:55  <mega1_> actually this is what the new generator emphasized
2010-11-29T05:14:29  <Error323> yep
2010-11-29T05:14:36  <Error323> i changed my code to snipe a lot more
2010-11-29T05:15:50  <GreenTea> yes this problem "not to take planet if after that enemy can take a better planet in center" bacame more actual with new map generator
2010-11-29T05:16:01  <GreenTea> because of 1-5 center planets..
2010-11-29T05:16:56  <mega1_> it was pretty hard to get right
2010-11-29T05:17:13  <mega1_> I certainly did not.
2010-11-29T05:18:39  <antimatroid> the whole game is hard

2010-11-29T05:24:10  <janzert> mega1_: yes
2010-11-29T05:24:28  <janzert> hopefully I will publish it somehow on the final rankings as well
2010-11-29T05:24:30  <mega1_> how does it look for the top
2010-11-29T05:24:31  <mega1_> ?
2010-11-29T05:24:45  <mega1_> is it converging?
2010-11-29T05:25:04  <janzert> but it's too processor intensive to put up live, it takes over 20 minutes on my machine which is about twice as fast as the main server
2010-11-29T05:25:06  <janzert> yes, it is
2010-11-29T05:25:40  <janzert> I'd rather not say too much about it though, since it may or may not be considered public information by some people
2010-11-29T05:25:55  <antimatroid> mega1_: it's looking very good for you :)
2010-11-29T05:26:08  <janzert> but of course anyone can check it themselves by downloading the pgn files I posted about earlier
2010-11-29T05:26:11  <mega1_> oh. Can we not get the same results by running bayeselo on the pgn files?
2010-11-29T05:26:18  <mega1_> ok
2010-11-29T05:26:52  <janzert> need to be careful if you use a stock bayeselo though since it gives firstplayer advantage by default
2010-11-29T05:27:08  <janzert> and wrong draw weight as well
2010-11-29T05:27:30  <mega1_> do you have command line example?
2010-11-29T05:27:35  <janzert> the defaults are setup for chess
2010-11-29T05:29:06  <GreenTea> draw vs bocsimacko. good!

2010-11-29T05:30:54  <mega1_> thanks
2010-11-29T05:31:16  <janzert> bayeselo doesn't work from straight command line options though
2010-11-29T05:31:31  <janzert> you have to feed commands on the standard input

2010-11-29T05:32:05  <janzert> if you're using a stock bayeselo you also need to add an appropriate command to cancel out the first player advantage
2010-11-29T05:32:36  <janzert> for whatever reason at some point in the distant past Jeff modified our bayeselo source instead of sending it the command to cancel the advantage
2010-11-29T05:33:00  <janzert> I don't remember the exact command needed offhand but it's something like "advantage 0" after entering elo mode
2010-11-29T05:33:27  <mega1_> GreenTea: that was a non-trivial draw
2010-11-29T05:34:10  <mistmanov> big news: I finally got my first game against a clear top 100 player -_-

2010-11-29T05:35:35  <Error323> ;)
2010-11-29T05:35:43  <antimatroid> we've been over this, janzert spent weeks picking out maps you guys suck on
2010-11-29T05:35:51  <Error323> wow I keep winning
2010-11-29T05:35:57  <antimatroid> i keep losing :(
2010-11-29T05:36:57  <mistmanov> but I really think that with the way the bots are written, and the way the pairs are selected, your initial few games can make a big difference in final ranking
2010-11-29T05:37:07  <mistmanov> the winners will still be the deserved winners
2010-11-29T05:37:19  <Error323> well
2010-11-29T05:37:27  <mistmanov> but like if you wrote something that sucks against ragebot, and get you get stuck in a field of ragebots
2010-11-29T05:37:34  <mistmanov> -->> fail
2010-11-29T05:37:37  <Error323> yes
2010-11-29T05:38:04  <mistmanov> can't think of a better way to do it though so I'm not complaining =)
2010-11-29T05:38:04  <Error323> but eventually you'll climb out
2010-11-29T05:38:20  <Error323> as you _will_ get selected by higher opponents
2010-11-29T05:38:24  <Error323> it just takes longer
2010-11-29T05:38:59  <Error323> wuut 2 more wins, thx mogron and netwalker :P
2010-11-29T05:39:05  <janzert> actually given a large enough field of similiar bots  you certainly can get stuck on the wrong side of it, fortunately it looks like the only large field of similiar bots are the starter bots
2010-11-29T05:39:28  <janzert> and if you get stuck on the wrong side of them cause you can't beat it I don't feel real bad
2010-11-29T05:39:47  <antimatroid> i still think the bad start could hurt at the end
2010-11-29T05:39:51  <antimatroid> for an otherwise equal bot
2010-11-29T05:39:56  <antimatroid> but again, i don't see a better way
2010-11-29T05:40:02  <mistmanov> certainly, it's not as if the final winner can get stuck somewhere
2010-11-29T05:40:06  <antimatroid> other than maybe introducing the newer pairing method after x amount of time?
2010-11-29T05:40:37  <antimatroid> an interesting idea next time would be to enter two decent identical bots, and see where they finish
2010-11-29T05:40:43  <antimatroid> perhaps try this after the contest?
2010-11-29T05:40:46  <antimatroid> with the bots all in there
2010-11-29T05:40:49  <Error323> janzert: the pairing cutoff is set to all crashing bots? :P
2010-11-29T05:40:53  <janzert> at the beginning of the contest the new pairing method and the old are equivalent
2010-11-29T05:40:55  <antimatroid> that would be a good testing method actually
2010-11-29T05:40:57  <Accoun> cutof mast delete game results of cutofed bots
2010-11-29T05:40:59  <antimatroid> enter all bots twice
2010-11-29T05:41:04  <janzert> Error323: not quite all but basically
2010-11-29T05:41:14  <Error323> heh i see
2010-11-29T05:41:33  <janzert> no, Accoun there games still should count
2010-11-29T05:42:17  <janzert> they are still just as valid game results
2010-11-29T05:42:28  <Error323> I don't see why not
2010-11-29T05:42:48  <antimatroid> it depends on the distribution of top bots playing lower bots?
2010-11-29T05:42:50  <Error323> especially when the cutoff will rise
2010-11-29T05:42:52  <Accoun> random luses to cuted off bots make final rangings low quality
2010-11-29T05:42:54  <antimatroid> if that is equal at cut off it's fine
2010-11-29T05:42:56  <Error323> all results should still count
2010-11-29T05:42:59  <antimatroid> otherwise i think accoun might be right
2010-11-29T05:43:07  <mistmanov> well if player X has been matched with a horrible bot and lost due to a fluke, and now player Y can't play the horrible bot anymore..
2010-11-29T05:43:23  <janzert> also something that might night be quite obvious is that there will be "jitter" around the cutoff point
2010-11-29T05:43:36  <janzert> might not even

2010-11-29T05:45:57  <janzert> since we 'know' the first player is 0 we manually set that

2010-11-29T05:48:00  <janzert> Accoun: yes, marking the leaderboard with some visual cue to the cutoff would be nice but isn't going to make it in

2010-11-29T07:10:52  <Error323> well i'm not familiar enough with lisp
2010-11-29T07:11:00  <Error323> but I thought it was pretty high level
2010-11-29T07:11:02  <mega1> there isn't much abstraction
2010-11-29T07:11:44  <mega1> It is. In this task it's mostly iteration left and right.
2010-11-29T07:12:01  <Error323> I see.
2010-11-29T07:12:16  <mega1> its main advantage was speed and ease of development
2010-11-29T07:12:24  <mega1> and speed of execution.
2010-11-29T07:13:46  <mega1> And I rewrote a few critical parts to be faster making them three times as long in the process.
2010-11-29T07:13:47  <Error323> I didn't now lisp was that fat
2010-11-29T07:13:54  <mega1> fat?

2010-11-29T07:14:42  <Error323> cool

2010-11-29T07:29:14  <mega1> I found little need to use macros in this task
2010-11-29T07:29:48  <mega1> scripted to me implies some kind of imperativeness: when this do that
2010-11-29T07:31:28  <GreenTea> then not scripted means that all moves are substantiaded?
2010-11-29T07:32:10  <mega1> not scripted is more indirect
2010-11-29T07:32:31  <mega1> in my case the eval function will choose between moves
2010-11-29T07:32:31  <Error323> looking at history of games from some, but there are quite a lot of draws
2010-11-29T07:32:36  <mega1> it's still heuristic of course

2010-11-29T07:33:11  <GreenTea> on high level my bot is scripted. is has 5 phases: defence, forcedAttack, support, captureNeutrals, attack

2010-11-29T07:33:41  <Error323> snipe, attack/defend, expand, support is the sequence here
2010-11-29T07:34:17  <GreenTea> and I found it is hard to substantiate what is better, to defence and then attack, or attack and then defence
2010-11-29T07:34:32  <Error323> lol I sort the target on growthrate
2010-11-29T07:34:38  <GreenTea> statistically beter is defence and then attack..

2010-11-29T08:53:27  <delt0r> davidd: also ratings depend on a "ranking" that exists... which it probably doest't quite.
2010-11-29T08:54:00  <delt0r> for example there are probably cases where A beats B and B beats C --but C beats A
2010-11-29T08:54:14  <delt0r> so whats the proper ranking of A,B and C?

2010-11-29T08:59:19  <delt0r> wait... are you saying a ording does exist? because its also the case that A beats B ... etc on *every* map
2010-11-29T08:59:30  <delt0r> ie it does not...
2010-11-29T09:00:03  <Accoun> in fact any top bot can beet any top bot on same map
2010-11-29T09:00:29  <Error323> if everyone faces everyone on each map and you compute win/loss ratio there will appear an ordering
2010-11-29T09:00:46  <krokokrusa> so, new maps were added
2010-11-29T09:00:55  <krokokrusa> in the middle of finals

2010-11-29T09:01:26  <delt0r> folks have done real math on this you know
2010-11-29T09:02:13  <krokokrusa> adding new maps in the middle certainly is not fair
2010-11-29T09:02:14  <Error323> true, but I think it'll give a pretty good picture
2010-11-29T09:02:43  <delt0r> Thats the idea of bays elo as well... but with less games is the idea... again from maths
2010-11-29T09:02:44  <antimatroid> i got a second win against iouri
2010-11-29T09:02:47  <krokokrusa> not that I care that much with my position in the rankings :)

2010-11-29T09:03:27  <antimatroid> it's not unfair
2010-11-29T09:03:35  <delt0r> krokokrusa: its from the map generator... so what? I would have done it with a random map for *every* game... thats how i was testing my bot... that never got entered
2010-11-29T09:03:44  <delt0r> unfortunatly
2010-11-29T09:03:46  <krokokrusa> ok, here is an example
2010-11-29T09:03:50  <antimatroid> you can argue about it being not desirable for many reasons, but it is perfectly fair
2010-11-29T09:03:59  <krokokrusa> let's say there were two players A and B
2010-11-29T09:04:22  <krokokrusa> for the first 75 maps, player A were unlucky and got more games on draw maps
2010-11-29T09:04:27  <krokokrusa> than player B
2010-11-29T09:04:35  <antimatroid> draw maps are just as likely with new maps
2010-11-29T09:04:44  <krokokrusa> meaning he didn't have a chance to win points
2010-11-29T09:04:46  <delt0r> so the distribution is the same
2010-11-29T09:04:59  <krokokrusa> then by COINCIDENCE, new 75 maps don't have draw maps at all
2010-11-29T09:05:04  <krokokrusa> it's random generator after all
2010-11-29T09:05:10  <delt0r> ie they have the same probablity of getting draws now as they did
2010-11-29T09:05:21  <delt0r> with slightly less variance
2010-11-29T09:05:30  <krokokrusa> so, after 2nd bunch of maps are added, player B has advantage
2010-11-29T09:05:44  <delt0r> krokokrusa: and you could get hit by a metor ---
2010-11-29T09:05:49  <krokokrusa> same probability
2010-11-29T09:05:50  <Error323> lol
2010-11-29T09:06:02  <krokokrusa> but for 1st 75 maps, then haven't got same number of draw maps
2010-11-29T09:06:05  <Error323> the more maps, the more accurate the true distribution
2010-11-29T09:06:11  <antimatroid> what really needs to happen is like 10 different unofficial tournaments run later with the bots
2010-11-29T09:06:16  <antimatroid> and try to work out what works best
2010-11-29T09:06:28  <krokokrusa> delt0r, funny, but formally A and B are not in the same position
2010-11-29T09:06:34  <Error323> but the situation ur describing is very extraordinary
2010-11-29T09:06:35  <antimatroid> i think a few bots should be entered into them that are identical too, and compare the differences in those bots rankings
2010-11-29T09:06:48  <rabidus_> i prefer everyone versus everyone at every map. count points and rank with them.
2010-11-29T09:06:49  <delt0r> krokokrusa: really nothing has changed
2010-11-29T09:06:51  <krokokrusa> Error323: it's not extraordinary, it's certain
2010-11-29T09:06:59  <krokokrusa> for some bots A and B from the top
2010-11-29T09:07:03  <antimatroid> rebidus_: so would i, if it were at all feasible
2010-11-29T09:07:14  <Error323> rabidus_: that's unfeasable, way too many games
2010-11-29T09:07:20  <rabidus_> only 1200000000
2010-11-29T09:07:26  <delt0r> not its not...LOOK at how many draws there are... tehy are common enought that nothinng effecily changed...
2010-11-29T09:07:26  <antimatroid> and inefficient
2010-11-29T09:07:26  <Error323> :P
2010-11-29T09:07:35  <antimatroid> no point having top 50 play bottom 2000 on all maps
2010-11-29T09:07:36  <delt0r> the first 75 maps are *not* draw free
2010-11-29T09:07:38  <antimatroid> that's just a waste
2010-11-29T09:08:00  <krokokrusa> delt0r, ok 2nd attempt
2010-11-29T09:08:32  <krokokrusa> if we have 2 almost ideal bots
2010-11-29T09:08:45  <delt0r> krokokrusa: you would have more luck complaing about cosmic rays and non ECC ram
2010-11-29T09:08:49  <krokokrusa> then even 1 draw map more gonna give advantage to one of them
2010-11-29T09:09:22  <antimatroid> i don't think it causes many issues by adding more maps
2010-11-29T09:09:24  <krokokrusa> i'm not to sure
2010-11-29T09:09:27  <krokokrusa> 75 is no a big number
2010-11-29T09:09:30  <Error323> mega1: so if i understand correctly your strongest opponent is iouri
2010-11-29T09:09:40  <krokokrusa> i's possible to have 10 draw maps in the 1st set, and 0 in the 2nd
2010-11-29T09:09:49  <krokokrusa> much higher probability than a meteor
2010-11-29T09:09:50  <delt0r> they are playing enough games that one does not change the ranking significanly... also tahts the point of the bays elo scoring... to be less sensitive to a single loss/win
2010-11-29T09:09:57  <mega1> Error323: no, it's Slin, of course
2010-11-29T09:10:12  <mega1> 99.2% vs 99.8%
2010-11-29T09:10:16  <Error323> lmao oops
2010-11-29T09:10:20  <Error323> yea :P
2010-11-29T09:10:35  <antimatroid> he lost 5 out of his last 7 games :P
2010-11-29T09:10:59  <delt0r> krokokrusa: your basically arguing that you are so similar to everyone that stochastic effects matter. In which case more maps is better *even if added later*
2010-11-29T09:11:19  <Error323> delt0r: exactly
2010-11-29T09:11:21  <krokokrusa> i'm not arguing abouy my bot
2010-11-29T09:11:21  <delt0r> Like i said... should be random map gen for *every* game
2010-11-29T09:11:27  <Error323> which is unlikely
2010-11-29T09:11:37  <krokokrusa> ok, 1 more example
2010-11-29T09:11:47  <krokokrusa> let's say we had 2 maps in the 1st set
2010-11-29T09:11:55  <krokokrusa> one draw map and one good map
2010-11-29T09:11:57  <Error323> no don't
2010-11-29T09:11:59  <antimatroid> i like the idea of a new map for every game
2010-11-29T09:12:02  <antimatroid> in the future
2010-11-29T09:12:04  <krokokrusa> player A got draw map, player B - good one
2010-11-29T09:12:13  <krokokrusa> then we added 1 billion good maps
2010-11-29T09:12:23  <krokokrusa> by your logic, it doesn't change anything ?
2010-11-29T09:12:31  <antimatroid> and it's not a computation problem, just generate them all before the contest
2010-11-29T09:12:31  <Error323> of course that does
2010-11-29T09:12:43  <Error323> but 75 vs 150 matters _MUCH_ less
2010-11-29T09:12:44  <krokokrusa> but it's similar to the current situation
2010-11-29T09:12:48  <Error323> then 2 vs a billlion
2010-11-29T09:12:51  <krokokrusa> bu probabilities are smaller
2010-11-29T09:12:57  <delt0r> krokokrusa: still arguing that stocastic effect matter....if it does your not really better anyway... and adding more maps makes it more accurate. You can prove this
2010-11-29T09:12:57  <Error323> krokokrusa: way smaller
2010-11-29T09:13:00  <krokokrusa> smaller but not zero
2010-11-29T09:13:04  <krokokrusa> not zero :)
2010-11-29T09:13:11  <Error323> they never are
2010-11-29T09:13:20  <krokokrusa> but nobody calculated
2010-11-29T09:13:29  <delt0r> again watch out for meteorites... or cosimic rays
2010-11-29T09:13:31  <krokokrusa> you're just assuming that everything is OK
2010-11-29T09:13:42  <Error323> no i'm not
2010-11-29T09:13:43  <delt0r> krokokrusa: run the numbers yourself...
2010-11-29T09:13:45  <krokokrusa> delt0r: prove that it's same as a meteor
2010-11-29T09:13:47  <delt0r> its easy to do
2010-11-29T09:13:59  <antimatroid> i saw a meteor on new years actually
2010-11-29T09:14:03  <antimatroid> at like 3am, it was amazing
2010-11-29T09:14:08  <delt0r> and if you can't then well i won't convince you either way

2010-11-29T09:15:15  <krokokrusa> delt0r: do you agree, that it would be more fair to generate 10000 maps right from the beginning ?
2010-11-29T09:15:18  <antimatroid> at first i thought it was a flare, as it came out from the horizon, but it didn't stop going up till it dissapeared into space, it was big and orange
2010-11-29T09:15:28  <krokokrusa> delt0r: doesn't matter HOW MUCH more fair
2010-11-29T09:15:34  <delt0r> krokokrusa: it really won't make any difference....
2010-11-29T09:15:41  <delt0r> the top ten will be the same
2010-11-29T09:15:47  <delt0r> and i don't really care about the rest

2010-11-29T09:16:49  <delt0r> but this OMG they added a map
2010-11-29T09:16:53  <delt0r> is silly
2010-11-29T09:17:25  <krokokrusa> it's not for some distribution of draw maps in 1st and 2nd bunch

2010-11-29T12:19:16  <rebelxt> just for your information, i ran a local test of my bot vs 7 other open sourced bots (iouri's, antimatroid's, medrimonia's, etc) on first set and second set of maps, and did not see any abnormal swings in the results
2010-11-29T12:19:46  <Accoun> rebelxt> u dont run my boot
2010-11-29T12:19:49  <Accoun> rebelxt> u dont run my bot
2010-11-29T12:19:55  <antimatroid> then release it
2010-11-29T12:20:03  <antimatroid> i get to speak not to him don't i, ehe
2010-11-29T12:20:17  <rebelxt> Accoun: no, i don't have your code.. open source it, and i can check how it performs on both sets of maps against others
2010-11-29T12:20:50  <Accoun> rebelxt> after fitnal result publications
2010-11-29T12:20:56  <Accoun> rebelxt> after final result publications

2010-11-29T12:21:18  <antimatroid> Error323: i think we both got the ignore hammer :)
2010-11-29T12:21:28  <Error323> ow and pull your sentences through a parser when before you hit enter.
2010-11-29T12:21:52  <Error323> because it doesn't make any sense on multiple levels
2010-11-29T12:23:14  <rebelxt> Error323: we are both doing better now.. it was a rough start yesterday ;)
2010-11-29T12:23:48  <Error323> rebelxt: indeed! though i'm in a losing streak atm hehe
2010-11-29T12:23:55  <Error323> but yeah climbing still overall :)
2010-11-29T12:24:50  <rebelxt> Error323: your bot vs my bot test gave almost the same result on 2nd set of maps vs 1st set. good sign
2010-11-29T12:25:17  <Error323> yeah i also ran some tests, its just as expected
2010-11-29T12:25:23  <Error323> give or take some noise
2010-11-29T12:25:30  <rebelxt> yeah
2010-11-29T12:26:37  <rebelxt> antimatroid: your bot is also very consistent on 2nd set of maps.. you got 40-2-33 on 2nd set, and 40-0-35 on first set against mine
2010-11-29T12:28:09  <Accoun> rebelxt> try to generate 75 maps by self
2010-11-29T12:28:25  <Accoun> rebelxt> and check result
2010-11-29T12:28:34  <antimatroid> rebelxt: :)
2010-11-29T12:28:53  <antimatroid> my bot is a complete failure to be honest, the tree is completely broken
2010-11-29T12:29:08  <antimatroid> hopefully i can spit something better out for the next contest
2010-11-29T12:29:08  <rebelxt> Accoun: did that many times.. i had 500 maps generated by myself and got nearly the same result against others
2010-11-29T12:29:36  <rebelxt> antimatroid: that's a great way to fail ;-)
2010-11-29T12:30:03  <Accoun> and need normal cut off system
2010-11-29T12:30:24  <antimatroid> what's a "normal cut off system"?
2010-11-29T12:30:37  <Accoun> not that strange like actualy
2010-11-29T12:30:43  <rebelxt> Accoun: just trying to prove to you that there is no conspiracy at all. you should stop thinking everyone is trying to make you lose this contest. make some friends instead of enemies!

2010-11-29T12:34:56  <Error323> and then there are more generated and he's whining about "chiting" canadians
2010-11-29T12:34:58  <amstan> antimatroid: he can say whatever, but he's literarly spamming, sending the same senseless messages over 10 times
2010-11-29T12:34:58  <antimatroid> yeah, he wont be happy no matter what, we established that ages ago

2010-11-29T12:52:09  <medrimonia3> Yep I'm thinking about the arimaa bot, but it seems really pretty hard
2010-11-29T12:52:16  <antimatroid> yeah, so many moves
2010-11-29T12:52:24  <antimatroid> and less obvious goals than this
2010-11-29T12:52:29  <antimatroid> well, incremental goals
2010-11-29T12:53:08  <Error323> arimaa bot?
2010-11-29T12:53:15  <antimatroid> look it up :P
2010-11-29T12:53:17  <antimatroid> and join us
2010-11-29T12:53:23  <medrimonia3> Yep it seems really quite difficult
2010-11-29T12:53:26  <antimatroid> janzert will enjoy the competition
2010-11-29T12:53:40  <medrimonia3> I'll take a break and study for my exams a little bit too^^
2010-11-29T12:53:55  <antimatroid> my exams already passed with 3 weeks left
2010-11-29T12:54:06  <Error323> oh shit
2010-11-29T12:54:08  <antimatroid> i got my results last week, there was a noticable reduction :P
2010-11-29T12:54:16  <Error323> haha
2010-11-29T12:59:43  <Error323> pff arimaa is insane lol
2010-11-29T13:00:04  <Error323> alphabeta and heuristics all over again hehe
2010-11-29T13:10:06  <Error323> 17K branching factor
2010-11-29T13:10:40  <Error323> pretty horrific
2010-11-29T13:10:44  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-29T13:10:47  <antimatroid> it's a challenge
2010-11-29T13:10:52  <Error323> oh ye
2010-11-29T13:10:53  <antimatroid> that's for sure
2010-11-29T13:11:10  <antimatroid> take a tea spoon of concrete then approach it
2010-11-29T13:11:23  <Error323> it seems specificially designed to annoy ai programmers =)
2010-11-29T13:11:54  <antimatroid> i think it was :P

2010-11-29T14:27:07  <medrimonia3> even in Bordeaux it's beginning to be cold
2010-11-29T14:27:08  <Error323> bhasker: we are on par
2010-11-29T14:27:14  <bhasker> yea i saw that
2010-11-29T14:27:28  <bhasker> i am 3 elo rating ahead of you :p
2010-11-29T14:27:56  <davidjliu> urg. I want snow
2010-11-29T14:28:14  <Error323> bhasker: just u w8 :P
2010-11-29T14:28:53  <bhasker> hehe
2010-11-29T14:28:59  <bhasker> david it doesn't snow where i live ^
2010-11-29T14:29:08  <bhasker> though snow is just 4hrs way
2010-11-29T14:29:17  <bhasker> do you really like it when it snows?
2010-11-29T14:29:27  <bhasker> my experience with snow has usually been too cold and not fun ^
2010-11-29T14:29:38  <Error323> oh really like it
2010-11-29T14:29:39  <bhasker> good to spend a few days but not something i would like to live with ^
2010-11-29T14:29:46  <Error323> except when my heater is broken =)
2010-11-29T14:29:50  <Error323> but its good again

2010-11-29T14:32:02  <smloh1> morning everyone
2010-11-29T14:32:15  <antimatroid> smloh1: morning, you're doing well
2010-11-29T14:32:31  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-29T14:32:35  <smloh1> thanks, yeah, looks like my bot had a good night :)
2010-11-29T14:32:50  <medrimonia3> bhasker: I love snow, it's really the happiest weather for me
2010-11-29T14:32:53  <antimatroid> mine is doing more like i expect (losing lots)
2010-11-29T14:32:54  <Error323> mine did to, but its day went less good :P
2010-11-29T14:33:03  * antimatroid doesn't really get snow :(
2010-11-29T14:33:22  <antimatroid> the mountain here does a few times each year, but not enough to snowboard or anything
2010-11-29T14:33:25  <medrimonia3> When you live somewhere where there's often snow, you get used to cold
2010-11-29T14:33:30  <bhasker> i like snow just won't like to live in a place where it snows
2010-11-29T14:33:35  <bhasker> i like visiting places with snow
2010-11-29T14:33:37  <bhasker> for skiing!
2010-11-29T14:34:02  <Error323> snowboarding!
2010-11-29T14:34:05  <Error323> =)
2010-11-29T14:34:21  <antimatroid> i would love to go on a proper snowboarding trip
2010-11-29T14:34:24  <medrimonia3> It's sure that if you live high in the mountain, you'll hardly have an internet connection
2010-11-29T14:34:28  <antimatroid> i went for 1 day a few years ago, was hardly satisfying
2010-11-29T14:34:42  <antimatroid> i used to skate quite a lot, haven't found much time for it the last few years
2010-11-29T14:34:44  <medrimonia3> Snowboarding is so fun, but you really have to practice
2010-11-29T14:34:56  <antimatroid> snowboarding was surprisingly not much like it
2010-11-29T14:35:02  <antimatroid> it's all in the hips to turn on a snowboard
2010-11-29T14:35:09  <bhasker> 5 elo diff now E323:p
2010-11-29T14:35:20  <medrimonia3> Because the first few days, you're more falling than snowboarding
2010-11-29T14:35:23  <antimatroid> i was trying to turn with my feet at first
2010-11-29T14:35:23  <Error323> bhasker: yeah, but i'll get past
2010-11-29T14:35:25  <Error323> passed =)

2010-11-29T14:35:44  <medrimonia3> antimatroid: I know that^^ It was the same for me
2010-11-29T14:35:53  <Error323> yeah bocs is dominating
2010-11-29T14:36:00  <Error323> and the true winner
2010-11-29T14:36:03  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-29T14:36:06  <antimatroid> without a doubt
2010-11-29T14:36:08  <smloh1> but there's another big elo step from the top 9
2010-11-29T14:36:13  <antimatroid> well, accoun will doubt
2010-11-29T14:36:25  <Error323> accoun is a moron
2010-11-29T14:36:30  <Error323> no offense ofc ^_^
2010-11-29T14:36:50  <smloh1> well he has a good bot
2010-11-29T14:36:55  <smloh1> and he taught us some new words
2010-11-29T14:36:56  <Error323> true
2010-11-29T14:37:31  <antimatroid> he gives me more fuel to win the next tournament
2010-11-29T14:37:33  <antimatroid> to make sure he doesn't
2010-11-29T14:37:35  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-29T14:37:52  <antimatroid> although bocsi may have us all again
2010-11-29T14:37:52  <Error323> yea i will do muuuch better next one =)
2010-11-29T14:38:03  <antimatroid> i did worse in this than tron
2010-11-29T14:38:11  <medrimonia3> I will start better next time
2010-11-29T14:38:15  <antimatroid> well, technically no, but my tron bot was stronger
2010-11-29T14:38:32  <medrimonia3> But I don't know if I'll end better =P
2010-11-29T14:40:35  <antimatroid> i can't find any page anywhere explaining specifics required for arimaa bots :\
2010-11-29T14:40:44  <medrimonia3> I don't know at all how I'll end in this one
2010-11-29T14:41:03  <antimatroid> like if bots are run for a whole game or per turn and what format input looks like :\
2010-11-29T14:41:32  <medrimonia3> isn't there a starter package antimatroid?
2010-11-29T14:42:15  <antimatroid> not that i've found
2010-11-29T14:42:19  <medrimonia3> http://arimaa.com/arimaa/
2010-11-29T14:42:22  <antimatroid> i don't like other people's code :P
2010-11-29T14:42:35  <medrimonia3> sample java and sample C C# C++
2010-11-29T14:43:13  <medrimonia3> a lot of things to download there
2010-11-29T14:43:13  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm looking at some of the c ones, the code is horrible :P
2010-11-29T14:44:30  <Error323> i don't rrlly like that game
2010-11-29T14:44:32  <Error323> =)
2010-11-29T14:44:44  <antimatroid> i think it looks cool
2010-11-29T14:44:44  <Error323> sth like planetwars is much cooler.
2010-11-29T14:45:11  <antimatroid> i'll prod it for a little bit and see where i get
2010-11-29T14:46:09  <rebelxt> is arimaa just chess on steroids? seems like the game was designed to be harder for computers to compete with humans
2010-11-29T14:46:27  <antimatroid> the game was designed for that
2010-11-29T14:46:46  <Error323> bhasker: lol 1 elo, we are both climbing =)
2010-11-29T14:46:54  <bhasker> :D

2010-11-29T14:49:11  <rebelxt> medrimonia win might be worse 5 ELO points ;-)
2010-11-29T14:49:35  <rebelxt> likely 3 though since you got many games in
2010-11-29T14:50:50  <smloh1> Error323: there are 22 java users ranked higher than you...
2010-11-29T14:51:36  <medrimonia3> Woot I'm the #1 python user atm!
2010-11-29T14:51:56  <Error323> smloh1: lol, yeah I cry myself to  sleep at night over that fact :P
2010-11-29T14:52:00  <medrimonia3> But it won't last... =P
2010-11-29T14:52:30  <antimatroid> from the looks of it they run the bot for each turn, not each game
2010-11-29T14:52:53  <antimatroid> Error323: that's what you get for using java
2010-11-29T14:52:56  <medrimonia3> that's even harder for the bot^^
2010-11-29T14:53:00  <antimatroid> i have no pitty for you :)
2010-11-29T14:53:39  <antimatroid> i mostly use c++ like it's c with classes
2010-11-29T14:53:54  <antimatroid> well, c with structs, as i follow the communist approach to programming
2010-11-29T14:53:58  <antimatroid> everything is public
2010-11-29T14:54:09  <antimatroid> structs with functions*
2010-11-29T14:54:21  <smloh1> yaay Slin to my rescue!
2010-11-29T14:54:42  <rebelxt> i like this approach antimatroid even though it's against usual OOP rules ;)
2010-11-29T14:55:15  <antimatroid> i've never been one for rules anyway ;)
2010-11-29T14:55:28  <medrimonia3> I losted 10 points against you bhasker^^

2010-11-29T14:59:13  <antimatroid> it was* :P
2010-11-29T14:59:30  <smloh1> lol
2010-11-29T14:59:48  <antimatroid> i failed there :(
2010-11-29T14:59:49  <rebelxt> i have not used it in 15 years at least... dunno if the language is still alive
2010-11-29T15:00:09  <antimatroid> yikes, i'd never programmed before 2007
2010-11-29T15:00:18  <smloh1> apparently it is: http://www.cminusminus.org/
2010-11-29T15:00:48  <rebelxt> yep still alive!
2010-11-29T15:00:48  <medrimonia3> I've never programmed before... sept 2009^^
2010-11-29T15:01:12  <smloh1> wow good work, medimonia!
2010-11-29T15:01:21  <antimatroid> very decent
2010-11-29T15:01:44  <antimatroid> and you didn't write your bot in java :)
2010-11-29T15:01:46  <medrimonia3> Thanks =)
2010-11-29T15:01:59  * antimatroid irrationally hates java
2010-11-29T15:01:59  <medrimonia3> Nop I still haven't learn java
2010-11-29T15:02:04  <antimatroid> don't, ever
2010-11-29T15:02:26  <medrimonia3> Only python last year and a little bit of c this year
2010-11-29T15:02:33  <medrimonia3> I'll have to learn java
2010-11-29T15:02:38  <antimatroid> c++ is wonderful if you're willing to write lots
2010-11-29T15:02:42  <rebelxt> antimatroid: java is "ok". best language for making money as a programmer at this time
2010-11-29T15:02:52  <bhasker> java is boring as hell
2010-11-29T15:02:57  <bhasker> and slow
2010-11-29T15:02:59  <bhasker> and annoying
2010-11-29T15:03:08  <antimatroid> i'd rather cut my eyes out than work with java
2010-11-29T15:03:18  <rebelxt> compared to dynamic languages, all static languages are annoying as hell ;)
2010-11-29T15:03:55  <smloh1> i just use it for programming competitions so i don't have to worry about deallocating stuff
2010-11-29T15:04:12  <medrimonia3> I'll have to do java to have my Licence
2010-11-29T15:04:34  <antimatroid> it's not hard to delete stuff :P
2010-11-29T15:04:59  <rebelxt> yeah i always used java on topcoder
2010-11-29T15:05:22  <antimatroid> the only time i ever end up needing to delete anything is when i make a tree
2010-11-29T15:05:26  <smloh1> get down to the logic faster, worry less about implementation bugs
2010-11-29T15:05:36  <antimatroid> even that probably wasn't needed for this tree
2010-11-29T15:05:51  <smloh1> surprisingly i don't really miss my pointer arithmetic
2010-11-29T15:06:25  <antimatroid> vectors make my life so much easier
2010-11-29T15:06:43  <antimatroid> and maps for acm problems
2010-11-29T15:07:00  <Error323> I started in java, but then switched to c++ for speed as I had high hopes back then for minimax :p
2010-11-29T15:07:40  <Error323> do like c++ better
2010-11-29T15:07:47  <Error323> but java is cleaner
2010-11-29T15:07:57  <Error323> syntax wise
2010-11-29T15:08:09  <smloh1> how much slower is it?

2010-11-29T15:09:00  <rebelxt> groovy is a nice language but as slow as python.. it pretty much fixed all the problems with java.. closures, much cleaner shorter code
2010-11-29T15:09:17  <antimatroid1> java is not cleaner than c++ :P
2010-11-29T15:09:17  <antimatroid1> main string argh fuck you*
2010-11-29T15:09:17  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-11-29T15:09:17  <antimatroid1> that's what java is like
2010-11-29T15:09:28  <foucist> c++ and java are the same damn thing as far as i'm concerned and if you guys think they're hugely different then you're crazy!  </troll>
2010-11-29T15:09:35  <rebelxt> java is normally "only" 2-3 times slower than c++ as far as i recall
2010-11-29T15:09:47  <pgpaskar> I read your text then checked to see if your nick was "fascist"

2010-11-29T15:12:56  <Accoun> java is good
2010-11-29T15:13:04  <pgpaskar> I like java namespaces
2010-11-29T15:13:07  <Accoun> ixpect java exeptions
2010-11-29T15:13:08  <pgpaskar> they are very verbose and consistent
2010-11-29T15:13:19  <Accoun> byt 1c.ru beter than java
2010-11-29T15:13:23  <Accoun> but 1c.ru beter than java
2010-11-29T15:13:33  <pgpaskar> Sure it's tedious to write code forthe first time
2010-11-29T15:13:45  <pgpaskar> but you learn to appreciate they verbosity when you start dealing with bad code written years ago
2010-11-29T15:14:54  <foucist> for verbosity/readability i like ruby..  for terseness, i also like ruby :P
2010-11-29T15:15:00  <rebelxt> being efficient in java (on a large project) requires a decent IDE, imho.. for python i don't use any IDE at all
2010-11-29T15:15:41  <foucist> it seems very weird to me to need an IDE to code
2010-11-29T15:17:21  <Error323> ugh I keep losing bah bah bah
2010-11-29T15:17:22  <rebelxt> foucist: current project at work is 7500 classes across all of the modules. impossible to navigate and re-factor without good IDE :-(
2010-11-29T15:17:50  <Error323> yeah an IDE just speeds up work
2010-11-29T15:18:01  <Error323> thats all :)

2010-11-29T15:21:08  <Mistmanov> never getting out :p
2010-11-29T15:21:20  <rebelxt> Mistmanov: where are you at?
2010-11-29T15:21:21  <Error323> so it seems
2010-11-29T15:21:26  <Error323> 116
2010-11-29T15:21:30  <Mistmanov> I got a game against oldman (~30) that I won, so I was hoping that I could get free..
2010-11-29T15:21:31  <Mistmanov> but no luck
2010-11-29T15:21:46  <Error323> perhaps tomorrow
2010-11-29T15:22:03  <Mistmanov> really, if they could just manually give me ~10 games against top 10 bots, I'd be really grateful ;p
2010-11-29T15:22:12  <Error323> well so would I :P
2010-11-29T15:22:27  <Error323> but ya gotta go through everone ^_^
2010-11-29T15:22:31  <Mistmanov> =)
2010-11-29T15:22:55  <Mistmanov> still... the games will only run till wednesday?
2010-11-29T15:22:59  <Mistmanov> so we're already at half?
2010-11-29T15:23:03  <rebelxt> Mistmanov: seems like you are moving.. when they start cutoffs, you should benefit from it since you would be getting many more games
2010-11-29T15:23:05  <Error323> its weird i beat smloh1 nearly 50/50
2010-11-29T15:23:06  <Mistmanov> or did it start yesterday?
2010-11-29T15:23:31  * Mistmanov has lost all track of time
2010-11-29T15:23:37  <Error323> lol
2010-11-29T15:23:49  <smloh1> Error323: i seem to be tuned well against the top bots
2010-11-29T15:24:08  <smloh1> i've been 2 for 2 vs both Slin-.- and iouri
2010-11-29T15:24:15  <Error323> yeah i know i am aswell but just not getting there
2010-11-29T15:24:20  <Error323> theres a massive barrier :P
2010-11-29T15:24:38  <rebelxt> wondering when janzert starts lowering cutoff
2010-11-29T15:24:48  <Error323> though ur bot is better smloh1
2010-11-29T15:24:51  <Error323> but not that much
2010-11-29T15:25:18  <smloh1> like i said, i run that secret function, PrayForLuck()...
2010-11-29T15:25:36  <Error323> 52% vs 48% +)
2010-11-29T15:25:38  <Error323> haha
2010-11-29T15:25:43  <Mistmanov> I think that once the cutoff is low enough (say... 125 ;)), they should also turn of the "you'll get more games agaisnt people in your neighbourhoud" thing -_-
2010-11-29T15:25:56  <Error323> loool
2010-11-29T15:26:22  <Error323> you'll still get selected a lot by them from lower bots then

2010-11-29T15:27:36  <Error323> what do you mean by standard?
2010-11-29T15:27:46  <smloh1> those that are basically the starter package
2010-11-29T15:28:22  <bhasker> the gap is increasing e323
2010-11-29T15:28:29  <davidjliu> heh, about to break the top 20, methinks
2010-11-29T15:28:31  <rebelxt> smloh1: janzert was planning to exclude all starter pack submissions some time today as far as i understood

2010-11-29T15:30:05  <Error323> smloh1: I think janzert said that 3200 to lowest were a mixture of starterpackage bots and some other bots

2010-11-29T15:30:36  <smloh1> davidjliu: good luck!  frankly i'm surprised my bot is ranked above you right now
2010-11-29T15:30:40  <JamesMG> that's more real bots than I would've expected
2010-11-29T15:31:23  <davidjliu> smloh1: thanks, I'm still recovering from a disastrous first day... heh
2010-11-29T15:31:37  <davidjliu> or at least I hope I'm still recovering
2010-11-29T15:31:52  <antimatroid1> i'm slowly dropping
2010-11-29T15:32:01  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure i overshot my target
2010-11-29T15:32:18  <Error323> I hope to end somewhere in top 50
2010-11-29T15:32:24  <Error323> but i'm not really sure :S
2010-11-29T15:32:32  <antimatroid1> i would like top 30, but i doubt it for this game
2010-11-29T15:32:59  <bhasker> i hope to hit top 50 too lets see
2010-11-29T15:33:00  <smloh1> i wonder whether there is an element of clustering in the rankings
2010-11-29T15:33:14  <smloh1> since you play people in your "neighborhood" more
2010-11-29T15:33:16  <bhasker> ooh 1 more win
2010-11-29T15:33:20  <rebelxt> smloh1: i bet there is
2010-11-29T15:33:21  <Error323> i think there is yes
2010-11-29T15:33:25  <smloh1> then your ranking is dependent on how well they do disproportionately
2010-11-29T15:33:49  <antimatroid1> i've been saying for a good month or so that it's not independent of the order in which you win games
2010-11-29T15:33:55  <antimatroid1> but it's also the best method we currently have
2010-11-29T15:33:57  <Error323> yey another loss :(
2010-11-29T15:34:01  <antimatroid1> so we sort of have to live with it
2010-11-29T15:34:05  <rebelxt> smloh1: i was running the same bot on TCP server for a day sometimes under two different names, and sometimes they were not even close (i.e. within 50 ELO) after getting 400+ games..
2010-11-29T15:34:27  <Error323> yeah same here
2010-11-29T15:34:35  <Error323> it was extremely unreliable
2010-11-29T15:34:36  <bhasker> 5 elo below the best bot from india
2010-11-29T15:34:37  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-29T15:34:41  <bhasker> will i beat it^
2010-11-29T15:34:43  <Error323> and lead me to upload wrong bots
2010-11-29T15:34:45  <smloh1> the question is whether it's "better" to wipe results with every new ranking cutoff
2010-11-29T15:34:46  <rebelxt> so it seems like getting stuck in a neighborhood is a serious risk
2010-11-29T15:34:53  <smloh1> then you get rid of the inertia
2010-11-29T15:35:12  <bhasker> i think with enough games things should level out
2010-11-29T15:35:31  <rebelxt> smloh1: yeah but then you don't take into account how top bots perform against lower rated ones. some may think it's not fair
2010-11-29T15:35:53  <smloh1> rebelxt: that's very true, you end up with very specialized bots as winners
2010-11-29T15:36:06  <rebelxt> my bot is tuned to suck against lower rated bots for sure ;-)
2010-11-29T15:36:31  <antimatroid1> my bot should do reasonable well against crap bots i think
2010-11-29T15:36:42  <antimatroid1> except when it does kamakaze moves
2010-11-29T15:36:47  <antimatroid1> then it's open for anybody
2010-11-29T15:36:53  <smloh1> lol then you need to run PrayForLuck("Get into the top 20 asap!")
2010-11-29T15:36:58  <Mistmanov> finally another game against a top100 player..
2010-11-29T15:37:02  <Mistmanov> one that totally sucks, but still
2010-11-29T15:37:03  <Mistmanov> ;)
2010-11-29T15:37:12  <bhasker> E323?
2010-11-29T15:37:16  <Error323> wraah I hate my bot for doing stuff like this: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9185519 turn 69 @_#$%
2010-11-29T15:37:29  <Error323> Mistmanov: die
2010-11-29T15:37:31  <Error323> :P
2010-11-29T15:37:48  <antimatroid1> :)
2010-11-29T15:38:20  <bhasker> actually looking at the top 50 list i am not sure i will make it there
2010-11-29T15:38:25  <antimatroid1> Error323: you're one loss off me and davidjliu
2010-11-29T15:38:27  <bhasker> some of the bots on that list are better even on tcp
2010-11-29T15:38:42  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-29T15:38:44  <rebelxt> Mistmanov must have hand picked E323 ;)
2010-11-29T15:38:46  <Error323> oldman is actually pretty good
2010-11-29T15:38:49  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-29T15:38:52  <Mistmanov> it's also like.. in the last few days before the contest I kinda lost interest since I couldn't see any blatant flaws that I could fix, but now I've already found 3 extremely easy fixes that also improve performance.. frustrating that you can't upload the fixes -_-
2010-11-29T15:38:54  <Error323> chiting bastard Mistmanov
2010-11-29T15:39:02  <davidjliu> woah
2010-11-29T15:39:05  <davidjliu> tied with dmj
2010-11-29T15:39:06  <bhasker> and given that mcleopold is at 35
2010-11-29T15:39:12  <bhasker> i don't have much hope of hitting top 50
2010-11-29T15:39:16  <antimatroid1> davidjliu: i beat him before :O

2010-11-29T15:39:29  <davidjliu> (a brief party before losing to _Astek_)
2010-11-29T15:39:42  <bhasker> aah thedreamer broke my winning streak
2010-11-29T15:39:49  <bhasker> but given that its #16
2010-11-29T15:39:51  <davidjliu> I think my bot usually beats dmj head to head
2010-11-29T15:39:53  <bhasker> shouldn't cost me elo^
2010-11-29T15:40:17  <Error323> i'll go back to 80 then
2010-11-29T15:40:18  <antimatroid1> jimrogerz seems to have you both beat for us though
2010-11-29T15:40:19  <Error323> snif
2010-11-29T15:40:21  <rebelxt> cfaftw's old submission (Oct 5th) is still in top50
2010-11-29T15:40:25  <antimatroid1> i beat jim, but then he beat me back :(
2010-11-29T15:40:28  * Ken69267 meanwhile will be just excitied if I can get back to 1400 :\
2010-11-29T15:40:45  <antimatroid1> Ken69267: :)

2010-11-29T15:43:01  <bhasker> i really wonder now if 0.23 might have done better
2010-11-29T15:43:06  <bhasker> oh well i will never know
2010-11-29T15:43:11  <Error323> bhasker: i doubt it
2010-11-29T15:43:23  <bhasker> well it was holding 40-50 for a really long time though
2010-11-29T15:43:25  <Error323> this one was betterr on tcp and i could beat 0.23 quite significantly
2010-11-29T15:43:30  <Error323> unless you made more changes
2010-11-29T15:43:32  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-11-29T15:43:37  <bhasker> no i didn't make more changes to 0.23
2010-11-29T15:43:51  <bhasker> this one actually does better against top bots
2010-11-29T15:43:58  <Error323> i wonder how much of a rock  paper siccor effect there is in bots
2010-11-29T15:43:58  <bhasker> 0.23 was too conservative
2010-11-29T15:43:59  <rebelxt> bhasker: max is way stronger against me, that's for sure.. considering "getting stuck in clusters" you can't be really sure which one is stronger

2010-11-29T15:44:31  <bhasker> 0.23 rarely lost to crap bots

2010-11-29T16:26:38  <Error323> antimatroid1: what's with the turn 40 waste top left
2010-11-29T16:27:14  <smloh1> the top 10 is remarkably stable
2010-11-29T16:27:43  <jmcarthur> i'm curious to see the confidence intervals. will those be published after the tournament?
2010-11-29T16:27:53  <smloh1> intersting, they are getting to 3 games with each other, vs 2 games with people lower down the ladder
2010-11-29T16:28:03  <smloh1> i wonder how strong of a clustering effect that adds up to
2010-11-29T16:28:19  <Error323> I just love watching those synchronized attacks from mega1's bot
2010-11-29T16:28:26  <Error323> they are awesome =)
2010-11-29T16:28:46  <antimatroid1> davidjliu: yep
2010-11-29T16:29:16  <GreenTea> It's mistery for my how he impelement such synchronized attacks
2010-11-29T16:29:26  <GreenTea> * implement
2010-11-29T16:29:28  <davidjliu> guys, the top 1 is incredibly stable
2010-11-29T16:29:38  <GreenTea> :0
2010-11-29T16:29:39  <antimatroid1> that's why i considered it
2010-11-29T16:29:39  <Error323> well i had it, but it didn't work as good
2010-11-29T16:29:42  <Error323> so yeah
2010-11-29T16:29:51  <Error323> mistery to me to i guess
2010-11-29T16:30:36  <Error323> it requires lots of confidence in ur future states :P
2010-11-29T16:31:41  <GreenTea> Maybe It reserves some ships for future..
2010-11-29T16:31:45  <smloh1> i have synchronized attacks too (grumble grumble...)

2010-11-29T16:33:02  <Error323> i did that but often i lost planets that were supposed to help etc
2010-11-29T16:33:05  <antimatroid1> i ahve them as well :P
2010-11-29T16:33:06  <rebelxt> same for me.. when my bot syncs attack from ~10 planets, it looks really cool when all fleets hit at the same time ;)
2010-11-29T16:33:07  <GreenTea> But what if in next turn reserved ships will be better to use not for attack.
2010-11-29T16:33:08  <Error323> mega1: how did you manage to do that ?
2010-11-29T16:33:41  <smloh1> GreenTea: then that attack becomes abandoned and you see strange things like insufficient ships arriving at the target
2010-11-29T16:33:48  <Error323> well maybe he re-evaluates each time
2010-11-29T16:33:56  <Error323> and just lets some attacks go
2010-11-29T16:34:01  <antimatroid1> well, it sort of does
2010-11-29T16:34:01  <antimatroid1> i send ships as early as possible for offense
2010-11-29T16:34:01  <antimatroid1> but i have it for expansion and defense etc.
2010-11-29T16:34:37  <smloh1> yeah synchronized attacks can be quite brittle especially if you are under attack
2010-11-29T16:34:46  <rebelxt> GreenTea: yeah i sometimes cancel scheduled fleets but only do it rarely
2010-11-29T16:35:20  <GreenTea> smloh1: so this means that this was mistake to send first fleets?
2010-11-29T16:35:43  <mega1> Error323: I reevaluate and sometimes abandon coordinated attacks.
2010-11-29T16:35:43  <smloh1> i guess it was a good gamble
2010-11-29T16:35:51  <mega1> Error323: which is a pain to watch.
2010-11-29T16:36:12  <GreenTea> Because first fleets are - send - but no effect because rest fleets are canceled..
2010-11-29T16:36:32  <Error323> mega1: also on neutrals? because i've never seen that happen with your bot
2010-11-29T16:37:12  <antimatroid1> GreenTea: I don't hold information across states
2010-11-29T16:37:16  <antimatroid1> if it's no longer optimal it's a sunk cost
2010-11-29T16:37:19  <mega1> Error323: I did, unfortunately.
2010-11-29T16:37:24  <smloh1> it's most painful when it's against neutrals, then you lose ships vs the opponent
2010-11-29T16:37:27  <Error323> i see
2010-11-29T16:37:50  <smloh1> antimatroid1: yeah me neither, you just do what's best in the current turn
2010-11-29T16:37:59  <GreenTea> "<smloh1> it's most painful when it's against neutrals, then you lose ships vs the opponent" exactly
2010-11-29T16:38:00  <Error323> but its such an awesome snipe reduction
2010-11-29T16:38:13  <Error323> and also the sync attacks allow for very difficult defense
2010-11-29T16:38:19  <antimatroid1> my "moves" were just a vector of "fleets" with a single destination, but multiple sources and times sent
2010-11-29T16:38:25  <rebelxt> this rarely happens though as long as you don't schedule attacks too far into future, and if your attacks are conservative (i.e. when it's safe to attack without exposing you to risk of successful counter attack)
2010-11-29T16:39:04  <antimatroid1> i would treat those moves as pure strategies in my attempts at a zero sum simultaneous game too
2010-11-29T16:39:28  <smloh1> well just because it happens doesn't mean you didn't make the best possible decision at the earlier point
2010-11-29T16:39:36  <GreenTea> Maybe scheduled coordinated moves, attacks - is the key feature of bocsi)
2010-11-29T16:40:11  <Error323> i think he evaluates each time giving attacks already underway priority or sth
2010-11-29T16:40:20  <smloh1> i found the hardest problem for me was the most efficient redistribution of unused ships
2010-11-29T16:40:39  <Error323> yeah i had a hard time with that aswell
2010-11-29T16:40:41  <smloh1> in order to maximize future potential and minimize vulnerabilities
2010-11-29T16:41:04  <antimatroid1> i like my redistribution system
2010-11-29T16:41:13  <Error323> just sending to the closest frontline was my solution, minimize in-flight time overall
2010-11-29T16:41:23  <Error323> via hubs that is
2010-11-29T16:41:38  <Error323> but ye its far from optimal
2010-11-29T16:41:42  <antimatroid1> mine was slightly more complicated
2010-11-29T16:42:41  <rebelxt> yeah funneling ships in a wrong direction is such a pain.. did anyone take future potential captures (i.e. planet clusters) into account when funneling?
2010-11-29T16:42:45  <antimatroid1> for a source, ships sent = min(usableships, 4*growth), redist planet = friend planet upon arrival such that it's leq distance to closest enemy and it minimises the distance from source to redist and redist to redist.closestEnemy

2010-11-29T16:43:50  <smloh1> i had a very approximate metric which tested how much "better" the future would be if each particular planet had (numships/2) more ships
2010-11-29T16:44:07  <GreenTea> "did anyone take future potential captures (i.e. planet clusters) into account when funneling" think about that - but no

2010-11-29T16:55:06  <antimatroid1> meneky: i expect they will
2010-11-29T16:55:09  <Error323> though tron seems interesting aswell

2010-11-29T17:27:41  <Mistmanov> a pretty ridiculous amount probably
2010-11-29T17:27:49  <Mistmanov> next contest should be to find a cure for world hunger

2010-11-29T17:29:58  <Mistmanov> without them starving
2010-11-29T17:30:07  <Error323> how about a simple RTS game?
2010-11-29T17:30:33  <antimatroid1> 2 player mario kart ftw
2010-11-29T17:30:49  <Mistmanov> I personally think planet wars is a simple rts game
2010-11-29T17:30:56  <antimatroid1> planet wars isn't rts
2010-11-29T17:30:57  <Mistmanov> adding different unit types etc just makes it more complicated no?
2010-11-29T17:31:01  <bhasker> is wondering if he will the next game

2010-11-29T17:31:52  <Zannick> so contestbot is right :)
2010-11-29T17:32:17  <bhasker> planet wars isnt an RTS, you can't take orders back!
2010-11-29T17:32:22  <JamesMG> a turn based strat like planet wars with different unit types and a resource supply
2010-11-29T17:32:34  <bhasker> i can't order my units back midway!
2010-11-29T17:32:34  <antimatroid1> rts == real time strategy yeah?
2010-11-29T17:32:35  <JamesMG> spend your resources on different things...
2010-11-29T17:32:36  <foucist> Zannick: you won a 50k word novel, yay!
2010-11-29T17:32:43  <bhasker> now if it allowed that then yes
2010-11-29T17:32:49  <bhasker> and it woudl be turn based anyway
2010-11-29T17:32:51  <Mistmanov> bhasker: ah yeah, that's a big difference
2010-11-29T17:32:57  <bhasker> not an RTS
2010-11-29T17:32:58  <foucist> Zannick: how much time did you spend writing it
2010-11-29T17:33:03  <Mistmanov> yeah ok, but any game is going to be turn based
2010-11-29T17:33:13  <Zannick> foucist: most of my free time in november
2010-11-29T17:33:13  <bhasker> well RTS don't have an explicit turn
2010-11-29T17:33:16  <antimatroid1> not necessarily
2010-11-29T17:33:17  <sigh> @echo [rankings], $randomNick(3654)

2010-11-29T17:33:22  <bhasker> they have ticks
2010-11-29T17:33:25  <bhasker> for resource counts etc
2010-11-29T17:33:33  <bhasker> but no explicit turns
2010-11-29T17:33:38  <antimatroid1> if you do rts, there can be no time limits to make moves, let players execute moves as they want
2010-11-29T17:33:42  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-29T17:33:45  <antimatroid1> just max time limit on games
2010-11-29T17:33:56  <sigh> no time limits?
2010-11-29T17:33:59  <sigh> why?
2010-11-29T17:34:03  <antimatroid1> cause that'd be cool
2010-11-29T17:34:11  <antimatroid1> trade off between spending ages to calculate moves and sending them fast
2010-11-29T17:34:18  <sigh> oh, i see what you mean
2010-11-29T17:34:23  <sigh> continuous game

2010-11-29T17:34:27  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-11-29T17:34:28  <GreenTea> in rts  two bots are runing in separate threads and do what they want
2010-11-29T17:34:31  <JamesMG> that would be really cool
2010-11-29T17:34:35  <antimatroid1> i like the chaser type game idea
2010-11-29T17:34:39  <antimatroid1> possibly with weapons
2010-11-29T17:34:42  <Error323> it would take much more time per game, but the games itself would be much more informative

2010-11-29T17:45:44  <antimatroid1> the cutoff atm was to remove crash bots
2010-11-29T17:45:53  <antimatroid1> the next round is to get rid of most starter package level bots
2010-11-29T17:45:53  <sigh> yeah, next change is supposed to wipe out default bots
2010-11-29T17:45:56  <antimatroid1> after that i'm not sure

2010-11-29T17:52:42  <Mistmanov> my bot does detect when it's static and winning.. but since that never occurs (seriously), I haven't even bothered writing the "so stop attacking" line
2010-11-29T17:52:45  <BaronTrozo> when you are winning is better to stay quiet, before taht i loose too many games by doing erroneous moves
2010-11-29T17:52:48  <Mistmanov> that would be like 1 extra line of code
2010-11-29T17:54:44  <rebelxt> BaronTrozo: yeah i had a safety check to prevent neutral attack when ahead. somehow that check did not make it into final version though.. however i only saw one loss due to this issue so far (lucky)

2010-11-29T18:01:03  <BaronTrozo> and at that hours my mind was trying to go bed
2010-11-29T18:01:07  <bhasker> your bot is quite good baron

2010-11-29T18:09:03  <antimatroid1> it'd be a huge fluke, but the year matches up
2010-11-29T18:09:20  <antimatroid1> BaronTrozo: i got my uni marks last week, there was a noticable reduction :P

2010-11-29T18:11:47  <JamesMG> I spent work downtime on my bot, sure
2010-11-29T18:13:03  <rebelxt> when i e-mailed my team about the contest, one of the engineering directors responded: "oh shit, you just killed my productivity for a few weeks"
2010-11-29T18:13:16  <phreeza> BaronTrozo: do you go to university in madrid?

2010-11-29T19:28:34  <bhasker> ebu what happened to your bot, it was doing much better on tcp?
2010-11-29T19:30:18  <eburnette> I dunno, stiffer competition on the main server I guess. I did resubmit on the last day.
2010-11-29T19:30:49  <eburnette> which may have been a mistake, it's always hard to tell whether you have a better bot or not
2010-11-29T19:32:37  <eburnette> I just published my source and post-mortem
2010-11-29T19:35:11  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-29T19:35:22  <bhasker> yea main reason why i submitted on 25th
2010-11-29T19:35:26  <bhasker> and didn't try to fix anything
2010-11-29T19:35:29  <bhasker> after that
2010-11-29T19:35:45  <bhasker> its hard to say if its really better without some testing
2010-11-29T19:36:18  <bhasker> 5 more ranks to go before top50 ! go bot go
2010-11-29T19:36:36  <eburnette> I ran like 1000 games on tcp and submitted what it said was the best variant

2010-11-29T19:46:15  <bhasker> take the move back

2010-11-29T19:53:08  <eburnette> that's similar to my evaluation function except instead of growth and numships I simulate out to the horizon and count ships then
2010-11-29T19:53:50  <bhasker> oh the game state simulates to the end

2010-11-29T19:55:42  <sanddbox> yeah
2010-11-29T19:56:00  <sanddbox> he captured a 5 growth a turn late
2010-11-29T19:56:05  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-29T19:57:39  <eburnette> There are a lot of fleets landing in one turn on that last state

2010-11-29T19:58:35  <eburnette> yeah, F 2 71 6 0 6 1 snatches defeat from the jaws of victory
2010-11-29T19:59:23  <sanddbox> janzert, you sure?
2010-11-29T19:59:48  <sanddbox> looks like one turn BEFORE he captures
2010-11-29T20:00:28  <eburnette> bocsi faked him out at move 189 by moving 2959 ships from the front line, really clever or a happy accident, mega1 will never tell
2010-11-29T20:00:32  <janzert> if you don't know the visualizer shows the state as of the beginning of the turn, and never shows the final state of the game
2010-11-29T20:00:59  <janzert> so at turn one you see the initial state of the map
2010-11-29T20:01:13  <eburnette> (and 2992 ships at turn 197)
2010-11-29T20:01:16  <janzert> and turn 200 you see the state at the beginning of the last turn not the result
2010-11-29T20:01:45  <janzert> and when the numbers say 201 of 200 that is just plain a bug
2010-11-29T20:02:08  <eburnette> I've been really impressed by these viewers in general though, even works on iPad now.
2010-11-29T20:02:58  <janzert> you guys keep giving me heart attacks though with these games that first appear to have the incorrect winner :/

2010-11-29T20:07:39  <eburnette> My guess is that's just emergent behavior, not something that was coded in

2010-11-29T20:10:53  <eburnette> And you divide to get a ratio between 0 and 1, that's a good idea . I tried using a squashing function but I think the ratio is better.

2010-11-29T20:25:39  <janzert> hey it's a great game. :) Even though at least a fairly major goal in making it was to make it harder for computers than humans it turned out to also be quite a fun game for humans. At least if you're into games like chess, go and such.
2010-11-29T20:28:20  <eburnette> I like chess. Arimaa seems a lot wilder and unpredictable.
2010-11-29T20:28:56  <janzert> heh, I find it quite the opposite. The position changes much less rapidly on the whole than chess
2010-11-29T20:29:08  <janzert> I think that's one reason humans do relatively better
2010-11-29T20:29:40  <eburnette> Hmm, maybe I should try playing it instead of just watching the video :)
2010-11-29T20:30:19  <janzert> and I suppose that feeling is going to be related to how familiar you are with both games too
2010-11-29T20:35:43  <bhasker_> lol ebu :)

2010-11-29T20:37:35  <bhasker_> rebel ran some tests, and my bot does markedly better on the new 75 maps compared to the old
2010-11-29T20:39:30  <janzert> heh, don't make me feel bad about it. Fortunately now pretty much everyone has played at least once on all of the maps.

2010-11-29T20:49:41  <janzert> eburnette: I suppose I don't 'know' for sure that results would converge. For instance if the out come of games was completely random they wouldn't or if there was enough intransitivity it wouldn't
2010-11-29T20:50:28  <janzert> But I believe and it seems to be the case that transitivity holds far more often than not and things will/are settling down.
2010-11-29T20:50:31  <eburnette> I'm not a mathemetician but I don't see convergence with this format.
2010-11-29T20:50:50  <janzert> looks like the top 9 have already pretty settled
2010-11-29T20:51:09  <janzert> not their specific order but who is there
2010-11-29T20:51:11  <eburnette> There is major intransitivity, A>B and B>C doesn't mean A>C
2010-11-29T20:51:50  <janzert> no, but A > B > C > D is A > D more often that not
2010-11-29T20:53:15  <eburnette> If by that you mean A>D more than 50% of the time, sure, but 99%, doubt it.

2010-11-29T21:04:20  <amstan> but there's a high chance a will beat b
2010-11-29T21:06:18  * eburnette is not convinced
2010-11-29T21:07:42  <bhasker> ebu from what i have seen its mostly true
2010-11-29T21:07:43  <eburnette> Look at jimrogerz and Accoun. Early this morning Accoun was #2 and jimrogerz was #9. Now they are reversed.
2010-11-29T21:08:05  <bhasker> well that depends on which opponents they are playing too
2010-11-29T21:08:12  <bhasker> right now all bots are not playing the same opponents
2010-11-29T21:08:17  <bhasker> so there will always be some variation
2010-11-29T21:08:25  <bhasker> thats why the cutoff will help
2010-11-29T21:08:32  <bhasker> since then all these bots will play each other more often
2010-11-29T21:08:33  <janzert> there's a reason the final tournament is still in progress
2010-11-29T21:08:49  <bhasker> which should normalize the elo and order it more strictly
2010-11-29T21:09:28  <janzert> and it's not because I want to drag this thing out :P

2010-11-29T21:11:53  <eburnette> Sure, but if the theory is if A > B > C > D then usually A > D, it shouldn't matter much what B and C are. But it does matter what B and C are, therefore that disproves the theory doesn't it?
2010-11-29T21:12:02  <burny> btw, if the results are anything besides 100% random.. the stats will eventually converge

2010-11-29T21:13:22  <dmj111> if i got this right, a 100 point elo difference implies the stronger player will win 64% of the games.  which is really close to 50%... so it is hard to tell players apart without a lot of games.  especially when the 2-9 are all within that range.
2010-11-29T21:13:26  <eburnette> Even if every bot played every other bot on every map, there would still be randomness that could move the positions around some.

2010-11-29T21:16:08  <eburnette> I agree with what you're saying janzert, for certain values of "more often than not".
2010-11-29T21:16:12  <burny> they'll eventually all be equal rating
2010-11-29T21:16:55  <janzert> also a big problem results not so much from small intransitivity cycles like A > B > C > A but
2010-11-29T21:17:11  <janzert> A > 100 different bots > B > A
2010-11-29T21:17:13  <eburnette> If matches are determined randomly, they will never have exactly equal rating burny
2010-11-29T21:17:27  <janzert> that plays real havoc with any ranking system

2010-11-29T21:17:50  <eburnette> :P
2010-11-29T21:18:04  <janzert> if that is common in population of players
2010-11-29T21:18:15  <janzert> my above scenario that is
2010-11-29T21:18:27  <burny> jus tlike 1/x for large enough values of x.. becomes 0
2010-11-29T21:19:06  <janzert> Anyway I really need to finish my post on why a few repeat games were played
2010-11-29T21:19:22  <eburnette> Try this exercise: Pick a random profile. Look at his games and note his rank. Click on the first player he lost to. Note his rank. Repeat. See if you ever get to #1.
2010-11-29T21:20:38  <dmj111> this is probably why elo isn't used to determine world champions in chess or tennis, or ....  it is just a best _guess_ at people's strengths.
2010-11-29T21:22:08  <janzert> more likely because humans don't have the time to play the number of games required to find the true best player

2010-11-29T21:22:59  <janzert> and actually there is a study that showed across several different professional sports with quite different season lengths and playoff systems ...
2010-11-29T21:23:18  <dmj111> i don't remember how it worked, but the game theory stuff i have read about voting systems implies that this is a problem there too.  there is no clear cut way of always determining the winner of a vote.  fortunately, bocsimacko is so far ahead that i don't think #1 will be questioned.
2010-11-29T21:23:24  <janzert> they all converged to approximately the same rather low (30%) chance of the true best player/team winning the championship
2010-11-29T21:23:39  <dmj111> janzert: yes, very true.

2010-11-29T21:24:09  <eburnette> Humans are less predictable than programs, and there's injuries and weather and so forth, so I don't think that's comparable.

2010-11-29T21:38:59  <eburnette> http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/TOHndBk_Feb_5_07.pdf looks interesting, a combination of swiss and elimination
2010-11-29T21:39:37  <janzert> take a look at the elimination tournament system used by the arimaa community
2010-11-29T21:40:03  <janzert> it is actually quite good, especially for situations where the number of games is extremely constrained
2010-11-29T21:40:15  <janzert> quite good at choosing the correct top player that is
2010-11-29T21:40:22  <janzert> not at giving an overall order
2010-11-29T21:40:48  <janzert> those are two separate and somewhat conflicting concerns

2010-11-29T22:13:28  <sigh> I wouldn't be surprised if the places from #2 onwards are still unstable at the end of the finals
2010-11-29T22:14:29  <burny> well, with 4500people, and a range of 4000 elo's, it'd be expected to take about 200k games per person, to make the scores stop fluctuating by more then 1-2 points?

2010-11-29T22:16:22  <burny> math
2010-11-29T22:16:38  <sigh> care to explain?
2010-11-29T22:17:05  <burny> well for example, if 2 bots are suposed to be 100 apart..
2010-11-29T22:17:24  <burny> and it's suposed to be 62:48 win ratio..
2010-11-29T22:18:00  <burny> if there's 200 games, the range is likely to be anywhere from about 65:60..

2010-11-29T22:18:21  <burny> which is an ELO range of about 40points?
2010-11-29T22:19:07  <sigh> hmm..
2010-11-29T22:20:15  <burny> after 5 games.. it'd probably be anywhere from 20-100%.. which is an elo range of like 500 or so?
2010-11-29T22:21:03  <sigh> what do you mean by between 20% and 100%?
2010-11-29T22:21:38  <burny> it's unlikely that the weaker bot would win 5/5
2010-11-29T22:21:55  <burny> but it's reasonably likely that they'd win anwhere from 0 to 4 games
2010-11-29T22:22:06  <burny> and expected that they'd win 2

2010-11-29T22:22:51  <sigh> at an elo range of 500 they'd expect to win 0, I should think
2010-11-29T22:22:55  <sigh> 500 is like 05%
2010-11-29T22:22:58  <sigh> 95%
2010-11-29T22:23:09  <burny> no.. this is for the same 2 bots
2010-11-29T22:23:16  <burny> the bots 'real' elo range, is 100
2010-11-29T22:23:42  <burny> but based on 5 games.. their win ratio, could indicate an elo range of up to 500
2010-11-29T22:23:47  <sigh> oh ok, I see where you are getting at

2010-11-29T22:27:57  <burny> 200k games, is for 1-2points range..
2010-11-29T22:28:06  <burny> are any bots expected to be within 1-2 of each other?
2010-11-29T22:28:49  <burny> any of the ones we care about that is
2010-11-29T22:29:03  <sigh> ah i see, you are multiplying the range by the number of games
2010-11-29T22:29:18  <sigh> I thought 1-2 points was the error
2010-11-29T22:29:42  <burny> it is
2010-11-29T22:30:41  <burny> but like the top 100 has a range of roughly 500 now.. so if they're within about a 5point error range.. it'll be pretty accurate
2010-11-29T22:32:51  <sigh> I don't know how to calculate this, so I'll shut up now :)
2010-11-29T22:38:01  <burny> probability, and the definition of what an ELO is
2010-11-29T22:38:55  <dmj111> i wrote some python code to do experiments with this idea.  it only really helps to see how certain we can be that one player is better than another, but not by how much.
2010-11-29T22:38:59  <dmj111> git://gist.github.com/721108.git
2010-11-29T22:39:29  <dmj111> calling : run_many_simulations(estimate_win_percentage(2), 10000, 1000)
2010-11-29T22:39:29  <dmj111> 
2010-11-29T22:40:05  <dmj111> gives : (287, 4, 709) so the player with a 2 point elo advantage will win most of the games, 709 out of 1000 times, if each time, the two play 10,000 games.
2010-11-29T22:40:25  <dmj111> i guess estimate_win_percentage is really esimate _lose_ percentage
2010-11-29T22:41:05  <burny> 709 out of 1k, for 2point dif?.. isn't that even more than a 200point dif is suposed to be?
2010-11-29T22:41:21  <burny> er.. nearly what a 200dif should be I mean
2010-11-29T22:41:31  <dmj111> one thousand runs, of 10,000 games each.
2010-11-29T22:41:58  <dmj111> the stronger player comes out on top ~70% of the time... so this indicates that 10,000 games is not enough.
2010-11-29T22:42:08  <dmj111> With 100,000 games, it is %95.
2010-11-29T22:43:51  <burny> why would more games, make them win more often?
2010-11-29T22:44:52  <dmj111> more games makes the "law of large numbers" take effect.  the more games they play, the more likely the results will match the expected 49.8 to 50.2 ratio.
2010-11-29T22:45:15  <dmj111> basically increasing the confidence in the results.
2010-11-29T22:45:30  <sigh> the other question is whether 49.8:50.2 ratio is really large enough to care about?
2010-11-29T22:45:32  <burny> how does winning 95% come close to a 49.8 to 50.2 ratio?
2010-11-29T22:45:38  <dmj111> sigh: i think it is not.
2010-11-29T22:46:06  <sigh> +2 elo points = expected win rate of 50.2%
2010-11-29T22:46:24  <davidjliu> dmj: where does the stuff in estimate_win_percentage come from?
2010-11-29T22:46:30  <burny> ohh....
2010-11-29T22:46:38  <burny> I think I know what you meant..
2010-11-29T22:47:08  <burny> that if you run 10k games, 1000 times.. that there's a 70% chance, that 10000 games, will indicate teh correct 'stronger' player
2010-11-29T22:47:10  <dmj111> davidjliu: http://remi.coulom.free.fr/Bayesian-Elo/#theory
2010-11-29T22:47:27  <dmj111> i think the wikipedia page on elo has the formula too.
2010-11-29T22:47:31  <sigh> burny: yes, that is what dmj111 is doing
2010-11-29T22:47:34  <dmj111> burny: yes.
2010-11-29T22:47:39  <burny> sounds like my 200k games for 2point accuracy, was fairly accurate then
2010-11-29T22:47:56  <dmj111> 200,000 games gives the stronger player winning 995 out of 1000.
2010-11-29T22:48:02  <davidjliu> okay
2010-11-29T22:48:13  <davidjliu> can't we just do this with statistics and stuff?
2010-11-29T22:48:26  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3936), jimrogerz(3741), _iouri_(3726), Slin-.-(3726), _Astek_(3725), GreenTea(3718), Accoun(3707), george(3703), protocolocon(3700), asavis(3652)
2010-11-29T22:48:33  <sigh> but even then, these numbers are if pairs are treated independently?
2010-11-29T22:48:36  <dmj111> i don't know enough stats, so I always go to doing monte carlo.
2010-11-29T22:48:41  <burny> shouldn't even have to run the bots.. just use statistics on teh code
2010-11-29T22:49:16  <dmj111> I think I am trying to make the point that small elo differences are really insignificant.  Or at least impractical for us to worry about for this little contest.
2010-11-29T22:49:21  <burny> I don't know the math atall
2010-11-29T22:49:28  <burny> I just used logic, and guessed
2010-11-29T22:49:30  <sigh> dmj111: agree
2010-11-29T22:50:18  <burny> dmj, the thing that is more meaningful.. isn't the win/loss ratio, after X games..
2010-11-29T22:50:37  <burny> but, the standard deviation of the measured elo, after x games
2010-11-29T22:51:24  <burny> eg. if it is 'suposed' to be 2 higher.. what're the odds that it's 4 higher?
2010-11-29T22:51:38  <burny> 4, or more, that is
2010-11-29T22:51:46  <dmj111> that is a whole different ball of wax, but yes, you could see how often the "correct" rating difference is calculated.  or, more likely, how often is it in the a range of the correct answer.
2010-11-29T22:51:52  <burny> although, I guess those are nearly identical things..
2010-11-29T22:52:11  <burny> the odds that it's 0 or lower, would be very similar to odds of being 4 or higher
2010-11-29T22:54:08  <davidjliu> using statistics, given two bots of "actual" difference 2 elo, it would require 82000 games for the better one to win 95% of the time
2010-11-29T22:55:25  <dmj111> davidjliu: excellent.  need to learn to do that...
2010-11-29T22:56:35  <davidjliu> but that's assuming they're only playing against each other the entire time
2010-11-29T22:56:46  <davidjliu> but I guess none of this actually makes any sense seeing that there's a finite number of maps
2010-11-29T22:56:55  <burny> needs 1point dif, to be accurate to within 2points
2010-11-29T22:57:39  <dmj111> davidjliu: yes.  this is all a lot of simplifications.  i think the biggest point is that a few points are meaningless.  a 200 point lead, on the other hand, is not :)
2010-11-29T22:57:51  <davidjliu> heh, this is very true
2010-11-29T22:58:00  <davidjliu> although I would like to point out that I'm beating you by 5 WHOLE POINTS
2010-11-29T22:58:02  <davidjliu> OMG

2010-11-29T23:01:15  <dmj111> i am wondering when wins and losses will quit changing the scores much.
2010-11-29T23:01:48  <dmj111> my wife is a QA engineer.  i told her my code was untestable though.  just like at work :)
2010-11-29T23:02:09  <rebelxt_> dmj111: i no longer see any ELO jumps bigger than 3 points.. but losing/winning streaks still result in some significant swings..
2010-11-29T23:02:59  <burny> currently each win/loss effects elo about 4 points?
2010-11-29T23:03:16  <rebelxt_> dmj111: untestable hehe. you should have asked her to test sniping, funneling, etc ;-)

2010-11-29T23:13:11  <burny> I think, ELO divided by lines of code would be a better measure though
2010-11-29T23:13:29  <dmj111> i would bet on the lisp bot.

2010-11-29T23:14:02  <Frontier> sigh: NOOOOO
2010-11-29T23:14:10  <burny> ELO / cpu time per game(not per move)
2010-11-29T23:14:26  <sigh> my 0 line bot would still do pretty well there
2010-11-29T23:14:58  <burny> you want HIGH value for ELO/cpu
2010-11-29T23:15:14  <rebelxt_> heh, this game is kinda fun to watch due to some crazy coordinated attacks in action (up to 10 planets): http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9225309
2010-11-29T23:15:15  <sigh> 0 cpu time gets you a very high value
2010-11-29T23:15:20  <Frontier> burny: That sounds good... although you probably coded in C like I did and dont have to worry much ^^
2010-11-29T23:16:12  <burny> you won't get 0cpu time
2010-11-29T23:16:21  <burny> it's still gota return successfully
2010-11-29T23:16:30  <burny> and take the paramaters, etc.
2010-11-29T23:16:58  <burny> and.. returning instantly will give you a negative elo
2010-11-29T23:17:26  <sigh> elo is anchored to 0 :P
2010-11-29T23:17:34  <sigh> lowest elo

2010-11-29T23:18:22  <sigh> yup
2010-11-29T23:21:17  <Frontier> some other coding games use their own interpreted languages. how do you like that idea?
2010-11-29T23:21:48  <sigh> what is the advantage of that?
2010-11-29T23:22:40  <Frontier> hehe, the advantage is that every instruction there has a fixed cost and the conditions are exactly the same for everyone.

The time that takes depends on the size of the constructed bots. Then you can copy programs from the starting bot to the new bot and give it a 'personality' like that. They can be small quickly replicating bots that just spam the board.

2010-11-29T23:31:51  <Frontier> The 'programs' are made up from modules or 'banks'. There are instructions to do calls into other banks so you can reuse code and modify your programs at runtime to some extent.
