2011-11-03T02:59:31  <Nare_man> i have a question about the lack of documentation ^^
2011-11-03T02:59:34  <Nare_man> anyways
2011-11-03T02:59:40  <Nare_man> i cant get the testbot running
2011-11-03T02:59:43  <Nare_man> :(
2011-11-03T02:59:56  <Nare_man> trying to use the php bot
2011-11-03T03:00:17  <Nare_man> perhaps somebody can point me in the right direction?
2011-11-03T03:00:40  <bobbydroptable> don't use php. \joke :)
2011-11-03T03:00:45  <pairofdice> There's decent tutorials for Java and Python on the website
2011-11-03T03:01:33  <Nare_man> python works ok
2011-11-03T03:01:53  <Nare_man> the play one game.cmd does work
2011-11-03T03:02:07  <Nare_man> but when I try to do a test_bot.cmd with a php file
2011-11-03T03:02:17  <Nare_man> it either crashes.. or i get a Failed to start

2011-11-03T03:04:28  <bobbydroptable> hmmm i'm not sure how the php bot works... does it need an apache server?
2011-11-03T03:04:59  <a1k0n> no, you can run php as a commandline scripting language
2011-11-03T03:05:38  <a1k0n> i've used it for e.g. a farmville bot since php is the only language which supports flash object protocols correctly
2011-11-03T03:06:11  <Nare_man> hmmz.. will try some other stuff then :)
2011-11-03T03:06:13  <Nare_man> thnx for the ideas

2011-11-03T03:07:08  <a1k0n> i found out the server didn't check for overlapping farm plots, so i had over 9000 strawberries stacked up in one spot which caused their process to run out of memory
2011-11-03T03:07:12  <bqf> a1k0n: wait... does that mean you also don't get invites to their shitty games? because if so, i am SO going to write a farmville bot to get banned!

2011-11-03T03:22:01  <thestinger> the sample bots are pretty useless and basically just fill a game slot :P
2011-11-03T03:22:16  <thestinger> making your bot play against itself is useful
2011-11-03T03:22:52  <ecarpenter84> is there a single line command for that
2011-11-03T03:23:16  <thestinger> just pass the command to start your bot more than once
2011-11-03T03:23:18  <Cali_> Is it a wise idea to create an Ant class to represent the ants rather than just using the locations
2011-11-03T03:23:21  <thestinger> instead of using a sample bot or w/e
2011-11-03T03:23:47  <ecarpenter84> rounds is number of matches?
2011-11-03T03:23:53  <ecarpenter84> or number of turns
2011-11-03T03:24:22  <ecarpenter84> i was thinking turns and i set it to 200 and it went past 200. So i closed my terminal and now i cant reconnect
2011-11-03T03:24:42  <Cali_> As I want to be able to store a best path to a location for a specific ant
2011-11-03T03:25:39  <thestinger> ecarpenter84: number of matches to play
2011-11-03T03:25:53  <ecarpenter84> closing my terminal doesnt undo that i guess?
2011-11-03T03:26:22  <thestinger> you caused your bot to time out in that game, you probably have to wait until it finishes before the server gives you another

2011-11-03T03:29:15  <Cali_> Thank you. Also does the default ants from the starter package save water locations you discover, or is that knowledge forgotten once it isnt visible any more
2011-11-03T03:29:35  <a1k0n> it saves it in the C++ one at least
2011-11-03T03:29:49  <krishna> Cali_: Every start package should do that
2011-11-03T03:29:57  <krishna> Since water is never sent to you again

2011-11-03T03:30:06  <thestinger> a1k0n: Fluxid's server ran into the open file limit before due to a socket leak or something in the tcp server, so maybe it happened again

2011-11-03T03:30:36  <Cali_> so before you start your first turn you know all water locations?

2011-11-03T04:03:59  <FastEddie_> looks good strcat
2011-11-03T04:05:04  <thestinger> yeah, it isn't really combat yet but it helps
2011-11-03T04:05:15  <thestinger> my ants just won't move into a location where they're just going to die
2011-11-03T04:05:23  <thestinger> unless it's a 1 to 1 battle
2011-11-03T04:05:50  <FastEddie_> how do you calculate the chance of survival? by looking at the number of enemy ants near the combat radisu and comparing it with your own amount of ants in the vicinity?
2011-11-03T04:06:35  <thestinger> yeah - it's a per ant heuristic right now though, so terrible things can still happen
2011-11-03T04:07:17  <FastEddie_> if you look in the top games there are many stalemates.. where you can actually see that one side has a larger force behind it and could push through

2011-11-03T04:10:03  <thestinger> right now I assume the enemies are all going to stay where they are, so it's not bad when facing off against cautious enemy ants
2011-11-03T04:10:34  <thestinger> if they have no combat code or they are aggressive, it doesn't really help but it doesn't hurt either
2011-11-03T04:12:53  <thestinger> I need to improve my movement a bit now - atm I only move to tiles that are closer to the target, I'll add some heuristics that allow moving to ones that are the same distance next

2011-11-03T04:25:47  <bobbydroptable> thestinger i don't see any hill defense?
2011-11-03T04:25:48  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-11-03T04:26:10  <thestinger> orange puts 4 ants around his hill
2011-11-03T04:26:16  <thestinger> my ants used to line up and walk to their death :P
2011-11-03T04:26:17  <bobbydroptable> that's hardly much of a defense
2011-11-03T04:26:22  <bobbydroptable> ah i see
2011-11-03T04:26:37  <thestinger> well, the code would work on an elaborate 20 ant defense too, as long as it stays fairly static
2011-11-03T04:26:38  <bobbydroptable> it does defend against random sneaky scouts
2011-11-03T04:27:00  <bobbydroptable> nice
2011-11-03T04:27:11  <thestinger> my sneaky scouts will just find the hill and kill one of the corner ants or wait for reinforcements now

2011-11-03T04:36:37  <thestinger> sometimes I get lucky and find their hill before they find mine basically
2011-11-03T04:36:59  <thestinger> the bots that try to defend will have a disadvantage against me now unless they minimax it or something

2011-11-03T04:47:28  <thestinger> you can watch here: http://ants.fluxid.pl/, or the page specific to your name (like http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat)

2011-11-03T04:48:29  <pairofdice> Awesome, got my ants to decluster
2011-11-03T04:48:36  <thestinger> what I do now is use two bots on the tcp server - strcat and strcat_next, so I can test big changes overnight when I'm asleep
2011-11-03T04:48:50  <bobbydroptable> cool
2011-11-03T04:49:44  <FastEddie_> how do you get them to fight eachother on the server? or is that just by chance?
2011-11-03T04:50:18  <thestinger> by chance - I mostly just check their rank and look at the games though
2011-11-03T04:50:30  <thestinger> I make them play against each other locally too
2011-11-03T04:50:38  <thestinger> I want to see how they do against other bots though
2011-11-03T04:51:51  <thestinger> for example, right now strcat is my current version and I'll test the new code I'm about to write on strcat_next
2011-11-03T04:53:16  <bobbydroptable> lol i got wiped!
2011-11-03T04:53:23  <FastEddie_> nice yeah
2011-11-03T04:53:25  <bobbydroptable> oh i think it crashed
2011-11-03T04:53:29  <bobbydroptable> wonderful =="
2011-11-03T04:53:34  <FastEddie_> on the official server you can't do that because you're only allowed one account
2011-11-03T04:54:23  <thestinger> I don't play enough games on the official server to get any meaningful data anyway :P

2011-11-03T05:23:46  <Garf> send each other a compiled or obfuscated (as appropriate) version of your bot and run locally

2011-11-03T05:24:11  <contestbot> thestinger: tcp could be http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto.
2011-11-03T05:24:29  <thestinger> ^ if you both use that you'll end up fighting each other (and a few other bots) a lot
2011-11-03T05:24:47  <SharkMonkey> Wasn't there another tcp server?
2011-11-03T05:25:02  <thestinger> yeah, and it's open source code so you could host one yourself for you and your friend(s)

2011-11-03T05:26:56  <SharkMonkey> thestinger, thanks

2011-11-03T05:28:03  <SharkMonkey> Minthos, I'm also running my bots from the server. My poor little netbook was melting :)
2011-11-03T05:29:00  <SharkMonkey> And the fan won't shut up :(
2011-11-03T05:29:04  <thestinger> I'm running a constant stream of battles of my old version v my new version locally, and running both on the tcp server
2011-11-03T05:29:26  <thestinger> and also a constant test against 7 dumb sample bots with a really low turntime to test for timeouts :P
2011-11-03T05:29:32  <thestinger> my room is really hot :)
2011-11-03T05:30:13  <SharkMonkey> Better than mining bitcoin :)
2011-11-03T05:30:16  <thestinger> when testing against the sample bots on a big map I sometimes reach 400+ ants
2011-11-03T05:30:59  <SharkMonkey> Maybe that means your bot needs to be more aggressive though
2011-11-03T05:31:17  <thestinger> it's mostly b/c it swarms a hill as soon as it finds one
2011-11-03T05:31:22  <thestinger> and it's an 8 player multi-hill maze map
2011-11-03T05:31:31  <AVAVT> the tcp server means I can play with other players without having to wait 4 hours for the next game right? cool :)
2011-11-03T05:32:06  <retybok> AVAVT: exactly :)
2011-11-03T05:32:17  <thestinger> yeah, you pretty much get a new game as soon as the current one ends - and you can run as many bots on it (under different names) as you want (unlike the official server)
2011-11-03T05:32:20  <SharkMonkey> AVAVT, People have been complaining about 6-8 hour delays
2011-11-03T05:32:43  <pairofdice> how many games per minute does the tcp server run
2011-11-03T05:33:21  <thestinger> I don't think there's a limit on the number of threads for games
2011-11-03T05:33:31  <retybok> pairofdice: it can handle a lot, but that's because it doesn't need to run the bots
2011-11-03T05:33:40  <retybok> there's a reason the official server is so slow
2011-11-03T05:33:49  <thestinger> and since the bots aren't running on it, it basically runs as many as needed - all the bots are pretty much always in a game
2011-11-03T05:33:56  <SharkMonkey> Hurray for distributed systems.
2011-11-03T05:34:01  <pairofdice> ah, right, there's also a reason it's called a tcp server
2011-11-03T05:35:05  <SharkMonkey> I actually drive the commands back and forth in my honda.
2011-11-03T05:35:18  <Fluxid> < SharkMonkey> My poor little vps would crash and burn. ← tcp server is the least resource-hungry service on my server right now
2011-11-03T05:35:33  <thestinger> except for the file descriptor leak :P
2011-11-03T05:36:00  <AVAVT> haha I just noticed that fluxid is the name of a bot on the main server xD
2011-11-03T05:36:36  <SharkMonkey> So is avavt :)
2011-11-03T05:36:36  <Garf> the TCP client also seems to leave hanging processes
2011-11-03T05:36:59  <AVAVT> oh I mean fluxid, as in the tcp server name, not IRC :P
2011-11-03T05:38:50  <thestinger> yay for cleaning up my codebase, down from 1400 lines to 1000 from refactoring
2011-11-03T05:39:32  <Minthos> AVAVT: it never occurred to you that fluxid is hosting the tcp server /and/ participating in the tournament?
2011-11-03T05:39:39  <SharkMonkey> I have lot of old commented out cruft in my bot code
2011-11-03T05:39:50  <Fluxid> AVAVT: i could use other domain, but meh
2011-11-03T05:39:58  <thestinger> yeah, about 30% of those lines are #if 0'ed
2011-11-03T05:40:29  <thestinger> I could just delete them because I'm using git but it like switching the code on/off for debugging
2011-11-03T05:40:38  <thestinger> oops, hit enter while editing that line xD
2011-11-03T05:41:13  <thestinger> I'll try again: I could just delete them because I'm using git, but it's mostly debugging code I'm switching on/off*

2011-11-03T06:03:17  <SharkMonkey> SIGKILL is the one that will cause a program to die no matter what right?
2011-11-03T06:03:29  <SharkMonkey> I'm wondering why the tcp client isn't killing my bot, on end
2011-11-03T06:03:49  <thestinger> yeah, SIGTERM is the polite version iirc
2011-11-03T06:04:40  <SharkMonkey> When I send a SIGTERM from the commandline my bot quietly goes away.
2011-11-03T06:04:55  <Zao> SharkMonkey: "no matter what" is a bit of a simplification, as you can be wedged inside an uninterruptible syscall.
2011-11-03T06:04:58  <SharkMonkey> Why won't it respond to the bot.kill() from tcpclient..
2011-11-03T06:05:08  <Zao> (borken hardware and drivers love to cause that)
2011-11-03T06:05:28  <SharkMonkey> Well I don't that that's the issue here.
2011-11-03T06:05:33  <Zao> Of course not.
2011-11-03T06:05:35  <janzert> SharkMonkey: what state is your bots process after it supposed to have been killed?
2011-11-03T06:05:40  <Zao> Tangents is my middle name :D

2011-11-03T06:06:32  <janzert> if they are becoming zombies then most likely the tcpclient script isn't reading the result code so the OS can close the process completely
2011-11-03T06:06:47  <krishna> Looks like it closes the socket before calling kill. Would that be the problem?

2011-11-03T06:10:15  <janzert> that's a small L btw
2011-11-03T06:10:34  <SharkMonkey> I see an R
2011-11-03T06:11:25  <janzert> hmm, that  means your bot is actively running (consuming processor cycles) so it's not just waiting for input on stdin
2011-11-03T06:11:43  <janzert> maybe looping on constant EOF from stdin?

2011-11-03T06:18:04  <bobbydroptable> it just quits and doesn't run :(
2011-11-03T06:18:25  <thestinger> oh, I think the ability to do that was removed in a new commit

2011-11-03T06:18:36  <bobbydroptable> oh so i just specify a really big number then
2011-11-03T06:18:46  <thestinger> I actually tweaked it a bit so it makes a run.lock file when it starts and if it's removed it won't start new games
2011-11-03T06:19:02  <bobbydroptable> why?
2011-11-03T06:19:25  <bobbydroptable> to prevent fluxid's server from dying?
2011-11-03T06:19:28  <thestinger> if you just do ctrl-c after a game it has often already entered a new game, and it will timeout on the first turn

2011-11-03T06:31:19  <thestinger> it's C++
2011-11-03T06:31:29  <thestinger> anyway, the current version does have very primitive "combat"

2011-11-03T06:37:29  <thestinger> sloccount estimates my bot would take 26000 dollars to redevelop :), it's actually just 922 lines of C++ now that I refactored some more

2011-11-03T06:39:46  <bobbydroptable> wonder if i can boil my bot down to a couple of parameters, i could maybe implement some sort of learning to find the best parameters...
2011-11-03T06:39:47  <thestinger> you have to copy your files to a new directory though or it counts all the AI challenge tools and the engine
2011-11-03T06:40:27  <antimatroid> i keep that stuff separate anyway :P
2011-11-03T06:40:41  <thestinger> it recursively looks through a directory though

2011-11-03T07:13:11  <thestinger> <unordered_set> uses a hash (like python set()), so you need to implemented that for your class if it's not a built-in
2011-11-03T07:13:27  <thestinger> unordered sets have O(1) access
2011-11-03T07:13:51  <conor_f> ok, but afaik they're not standard and it'd mean I'd have to manually include it
2011-11-03T07:13:56  <thestinger> if you can use consecutive integers as keys, use a vector (so a 2d vector/array to represent the map)
2011-11-03T07:14:07  <thestinger> no, unordered_set is standard in C++11, which you can use
2011-11-03T07:14:17  <conor_f> oh :)
2011-11-03T07:14:18  <conor_f> maybe
2011-11-03T07:14:38  <thestinger> use -std=c++0x with g++/gcc and change the file extension of MyBot to .cpp instead of .cc (the server uses that to decide if it's C++11)

2011-11-03T07:15:42  <conor_f> ok, so it'd need to be a 2d vector
2011-11-03T07:15:56  <thestinger> and you need an extra space between the two '>' at the end if you don't have -std=c++0x turned on
2011-11-03T07:16:32  <conor_f> but this was the problem I was having, I want the first one to store ints and the second one Location structs
2011-11-03T07:16:50  <conor_f> so I'll need to use an unordered set?
2011-11-03T07:17:09  <thestinger> well, doesn't the location struct just have row/col?
2011-11-03T07:17:15  <conor_f> yeah

2011-11-03T07:20:10  <thestinger> well, unordered set is just values (no keys/values)
2011-11-03T07:20:31  <thestinger> you want an unordered_map or map (those are key/value storage, like a python dict/ordered dict)
2011-11-03T07:20:42  <conor_f> thank you so much

2011-11-03T07:21:17  <thestinger> yeah, dict is a hash table so unordered_map is the same thing
2011-11-03T07:21:22  <conor_f> got set, should have been using maps :/ maybe I just picked it up wrong
2011-11-03T07:21:32  <thestinger> you need -std=c++0x for that, but you can use it now
2011-11-03T07:21:35  <conor_f> sweet, ok
2011-11-03T07:21:42  <conor_f> just modify the makefile
2011-11-03T07:21:57  <thestinger> yeah, that will let you use it locally, the server ignores the makefile though
2011-11-03T07:22:16  <thestinger> rename MyBot.cc to MyBot.cpp and the server will use -std=c++0x
2011-11-03T07:22:17  <conor_f> oh, so where do I change it on the server? Or just change it all to .cpp?

2011-11-03T07:23:43  <conor_f> lol @myBot, once one ant sees some food, they all go for it :P
2011-11-03T07:23:54  <bobbydroptable> conor_f mine has that problem too
2011-11-03T07:23:55  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-11-03T07:23:58  <conor_f> accidental swarming I suppose :P
2011-11-03T07:24:05  <conor_f> bobbydroptable: cool name :P
2011-11-03T07:24:12  <bobbydroptable> hahaha thank you
2011-11-03T07:24:23  <thestinger> btw, I think you'll need to make your own hash function/functor thing for a non-primitive type as a key
2011-11-03T07:24:35  <conor_f> oh?
2011-11-03T07:24:50  <thestinger> you could just hash the row and append it to the hash of the col or something

2011-11-03T07:24:55  <conor_f> can I not just declare it map<struct>
2011-11-03T07:24:56  <conor_f> ?
2011-11-03T07:25:28  <conor_f> thestinger: it's ok actually, I'd be using ints as the key and Location structs as the value
2011-11-03T07:25:33  <PeterS_> Hello
2011-11-03T07:25:50  <conor_f> hi PeterS_
2011-11-03T07:26:07  <PeterS_> How much memory can my bot use?
2011-11-03T07:26:17  <thestinger> conor_f: you can get a unique integer value based on row and col
2011-11-03T07:26:19  <PeterS_> Is there a limit
2011-11-03T07:26:19  <PeterS_> ?
2011-11-03T07:26:36  <thestinger> 1GB iirc
2011-11-03T07:27:04  <PeterS_> You know if that is documented somewhere? I find it very hard to find things there...
2011-11-03T07:27:07  <conor_f> thestinger: in the starter kit for cpp, there's a for loop that iterates through all the ants
2011-11-03T07:27:17  <conor_f> I figured I could just use that value?
2011-11-03T07:27:32  <thestinger> I think the order will change every turn
2011-11-03T07:28:04  <conor_f> hmm, I could use (x_coord*10)+(y_coord) to give me a unique location

2011-11-03T07:28:46  <conor_f> it's annoying that each ant isn't a class/struct :/ would have made things a lot easier (e.g. each ant have its own id)
2011-11-03T07:29:05  <conor_f> row * any_constant + col? :P
2011-11-03T07:29:32  <conor_f> any particular reason for using map_width?
2011-11-03T07:30:46  <antimatroid> conor_f: i may be helpful with c++ questions
2011-11-03T07:30:59  <antimatroid> i was doing an exam when you first started asking stuff yesterday so didn't respond :P
2011-11-03T07:31:10  <conor_f> antimatroid: heh, np :P
2011-11-03T07:31:31  <conor_f> I g2g dentist in a few so maybe I can annoy you later with questions :P
2011-11-03T07:31:33  <bqf> conor_f: consider x=0, y=11 and x=1, y=1 for your c=10 proposal above. so no, not just any constant. (i have no idea what you're talking about since i didn't read the backlog, i just saw your "unique location" comment)

2011-11-03T07:32:12  <antimatroid> conor do you know how to use sets yet? googling "object c++" usually comes up with a good reference page for functions
2011-11-03T07:32:56  <conor_f> I spent a good while searching yesterday. was looking for some example code or something. the best I found was on cplusplus.com which wasn't too helpfuul
2011-11-03T07:32:59  <conor_f> *helpful
2011-11-03T07:33:10  <antimatroid> i'll do an example int one give me a minue
2011-11-03T07:34:34  <thestinger> conor_f: row * map_width + col will get you a unique int
2011-11-03T07:34:39  <conor_f> ok :) tyvm I've got to get a bus in 10 mins so I'll hassle you on stuff I don't understand later
2011-11-03T07:35:27  <conor_f> thestinger: ok, so I'd use that as the key and then the Location as the value
2011-11-03T07:35:38  <thestinger> yeah, you could do that
2011-11-03T07:35:40  <conor_f> I don't see why they're not in the same order each time, unles one dies

2011-11-03T07:36:33  <thestinger> conor_f: I think it reads it from the server each turn, and the order they're sent in will change
2011-11-03T07:37:52  <conor_f> kk, I just saw it reading from a vector, so thats where I got it from. Either way, I'd have to do something to change it as I couldn't have random bots going after food because the one before it died
2011-11-03T07:38:07  <antimatroid> conor_f: http://codepad.org/DQLUz2j5
2011-11-03T07:38:23  <antimatroid> if you're doing a set<yourOwnStruct> then you need to overload the < operator
2011-11-03T07:39:44  <conor_f> ok, yeah
2011-11-03T07:39:48  <antimatroid> conor_f: one thing i find cleans stuff up is to add a vector of neighbour locations to each square, then remove the appropriate neighbours as you receive water information and you can use those when path finding (like a graph) rather than calculating neighbours and checking for water etc.
2011-11-03T07:40:00  <conor_f> I think I've done that, well, I've got code that does that :P
2011-11-03T07:40:46  <antimatroid> yeah, just be something like "bool operator<(const myStruct &A, const myStruct &B)"
2011-11-03T07:40:48  <conor_f> maybe I'd implement that later antimatroid, but for now I just want to make a basic bot roughly along the guide of the tutorial
2011-11-03T07:41:10  <conor_f> static bool operator<(const Location &a, const Location &b)
2011-11-03T07:41:10  <conor_f> {  return a.row == b.row ? a.col < b.col : a.row < b.row;

2011-11-03T11:39:08  <AVAVT> Someone told me that A* is good only for 1-1 path finding, and the ant game is a N to M problem.
2011-11-03T11:39:15  <marijnfs> thats right
2011-11-03T11:39:23  <AVAVT> Yeah I'm using A* with some.. tweak
2011-11-03T11:39:27  <marijnfs> but if you give your ants goals
2011-11-03T11:39:30  <treeform> heh tcp bots are much harder

2011-11-03T11:40:59  <thestinger> alright, I really can't figure out how my last few commits broke my crappy combat stuff >.<
2011-11-03T11:41:11  <thestinger> it doesn't even appear to be fully broken because strcat_next is still doing well
2011-11-03T11:41:28  <marijnfs> well if you have 2 foods and 2 ants you have to figure out the closest ant-food pair
2011-11-03T11:41:33  <marijnfs> and then calculate the second one
2011-11-03T11:41:38  <thestinger> definitely not always working though
2011-11-03T11:41:44  <marijnfs> these things cost time
2011-11-03T11:42:02  <marijnfs> but i think it is linear in the number of min(food,ant)
2011-11-03T11:42:19  <marijnfs> * time needed for calculation
2011-11-03T11:42:22  <treeform> and some times getting the closts food is not a good choice too
2011-11-03T11:42:30  <marijnfs> which is number of squares on the map in worst case
2011-11-03T11:42:38  <marijnfs> not too big actually for a computer
2011-11-03T11:42:50  <treeform> if your far bot goes for far food and the bot behind him gets the closest food you get 2 food in time it would take one?

2011-11-03T11:43:05  <marijnfs> yeah
2011-11-03T11:43:19  <marijnfs> so i just let my ants be attracted by the closest food
2011-11-03T11:43:37  <marijnfs> then they move together in that directions which is not always bad
2011-11-03T11:43:42  <marijnfs> if there is more food after that
2011-11-03T11:44:05  <AVAVT> but with that idea how do your ant navigate through mazes?
2011-11-03T11:44:20  <thestinger> measure distance with BFS, not manhattan distance
2011-11-03T11:44:32  <marijnfs> well the are attracted by unexplored fronts with my ants
2011-11-03T11:44:57  <QuirionPT> Are land patches on the map guaranteed to be connected? i.e. are there land patches where it is impossible to go to?
2011-11-03T11:45:07  <AVAVT> I was trying the suggestion from a site and try a p*mahattan distance heuristic
2011-11-03T11:45:20  <treeform> why use real distances when every this is manhattan distance a way?
2011-11-03T11:45:35  <thestinger> QuirionPT: there are no islands, you can get to all the land on the map
2011-11-03T11:45:43  <marijnfs> does it matter? bfs doesnt traverse to those parts of the map
2011-11-03T11:46:16  <Minthos> if you just pick a spot at random it matters
2011-11-03T11:46:26  <AVAVT> but real distance are always smaller than the actual manhattan distance, doesn't it slow down your search speed?

2011-11-03T11:46:55  <thestinger> AVAVT: BFS from a target across the map gets you all the distance measurements and shortest paths for anywhere on the map
2011-11-03T11:47:53  <marijnfs> yeah ok
2011-11-03T11:48:05  <marijnfs> but the result would be 'unreachable' which is true

2011-11-03T11:49:32  <AVAVT> thestinger : yeah BFS is breadth  first search right? I tried it at the beginning but my bot would time out whenever I reach about 20 ants. Was I not applying it the right way?
2011-11-03T11:50:23  <AVAVT> haha just got a new game, somehow ended up 3rd although the other bots seem so much better than mine xD
2011-11-03T11:51:50  <thestinger> AVAVT: you don't do it for every ant
2011-11-03T11:52:00  <thestinger> lets say there are 2 hills you want to attack with all your idle ants
2011-11-03T11:52:19  <thestinger> you do a BFS from the first hill, marking off all the distances from the target in a 2d array or whatever
2011-11-03T11:52:45  <thestinger> then you can do the second hill with that same array if you want, which gives you what's basically a height map with 2 "drains"

2011-11-03T11:53:24  <thestinger> you can check the value at any [row][col] to get the distance from a target, and check the neighbouring squares to see which will bring you closer
2011-11-03T11:53:50  <thestinger> anyway, if you were timing out @ 20 BFS searches, you were probably doing it wrong :P

2011-11-03T11:54:22  <thestinger> I can do 100+ in under 10ms, but I don't have a reason to do that
2011-11-03T11:54:59  <AVAVT> >.> that's pretty awesome
2011-11-03T11:55:13  <AVAVT> but I didn't get your idea of the 2 hills though
2011-11-03T11:55:40  <thestinger> so, instead of keeping track of visited nodes that you don't want to revisit, you just make sure the new distance you would be giving a node is smaller than the old one
2011-11-03T11:56:04  <thestinger> that also lets you add multiple targets to one of the 2d distance map arrays
2011-11-03T11:56:18  <thestinger> I use that for hills/exploration (not food)
2011-11-03T11:56:35  <AVAVT> I... see
2011-11-03T11:56:55  <thestinger> there are breadth-first searches in a lot of the starter bots, so you can use that as a starting point
2011-11-03T11:57:03  <thestinger> they use it for updating which squares are visible
2011-11-03T11:57:05  <AVAVT> and for exploration you scan from your hills to unexplored areas right?
2011-11-03T11:57:31  <thestinger> for exploration I do a BFS from each unexplored area
2011-11-03T11:58:17  <thestinger> on the first turn that's almost the whole map, but it's still just 7ms on a 200x200 map, because most of the searches end after 4 iterations (the squares next to them are also 0 distance from an unexplored loc)
2011-11-03T11:58:31  <ejls> Is viewradius2 77 now ?
2011-11-03T11:59:41  <conor_f> why weren't all starter bots made the same>
2011-11-03T11:59:42  <marijnfs> yeah thats the way to do it
2011-11-03T11:59:42  <conor_f> *?
2011-11-03T11:59:46  <AVAVT> oh, you only save path distance for explored location right?
2011-11-03T12:00:15  <thestinger> I just end up with a 2d vector of distances
2011-11-03T12:00:26  <thestinger> I don't save any of it after I use it to order my ants around

2011-11-03T12:06:53  <bqf> a1k0n: i can sympathize with your bot. when i have to choose between, say, pizza and burgers, that is pretty much how i end up behaving.
2011-11-03T12:08:41  <a1k0n> it's more like pizza vs. burgers and fries.  it wants pizza more but it doesn't want to give up burgers *and* fries
2011-11-03T12:08:58  <conor_f> in a C++ map, can I find() by value instead of by key?
2011-11-03T12:10:04  <a1k0n> well.. you cam iterate from begin() to end()
2011-11-03T12:10:23  <a1k0n> and use the global find() to do it
2011-11-03T12:10:45  <bqf> a1k0n: so what exactly goes wrong there? does it fail to schedule the priorities and thus not move at all?
2011-11-03T12:10:50  <conor_f> find() takes a key as a parameter, no version of find with value as a parameter?
2011-11-03T12:10:52  <thestinger> lol, I have a really weird bug
2011-11-03T12:11:17  <AVAVT> btw anyone what's the skill rating of the game called? I remember someone it's call true rating or something...
2011-11-03T12:11:20  <thestinger> sometimes my count of enemies that can attack a square is something like 18 o_o
2011-11-03T12:11:33  <a1k0n> bqf: it assumes "value" from each food is additive so moving closer to one moves it further away from two others
2011-11-03T12:11:41  <a1k0n> it's exponentially weighted so normally this works
2011-11-03T12:11:50  <amstan> AVAVT: trueskill
2011-11-03T12:12:14  <AVAVT> right, thanks :)
2011-11-03T12:12:16  <a1k0n> it just needs to know the value of not moving is worse
2011-11-03T12:13:43  <marijnfs> conor_f: find should take a value
2011-11-03T12:13:57  <marijnfs> to get element by key you use []
2011-11-03T12:14:00  <marijnfs> thats why it is a map
2011-11-03T12:14:21  <conor_f> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/map/find/
2011-11-03T12:14:22  <marijnfs>       iterator find ( const key_type& x );
2011-11-03T12:14:25  <marijnfs> KEY_TYPE
2011-11-03T12:14:32  <conor_f> looking at the code example it's a key
2011-11-03T12:14:45  <conor_f> I think I've found an ok workaround though, ty
2011-11-03T12:14:46  <marijnfs> thenn
2011-11-03T12:15:05  <conor_f> yeah, just a for loop with an iter.begin() to end()
2011-11-03T12:15:06  <marijnfs> yeah i dont know
2011-11-03T12:15:19  <conor_f> np
2011-11-03T12:15:22  <a1k0n> http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/find.html
2011-11-03T12:15:34  <conor_f> btw, does your bot do some sort of swarming marijnfs?
2011-11-03T12:15:55  <a1k0n> i meant you can shoehorn a map iterator in there but it's easier to just write a for loop
2011-11-03T12:16:07  <conor_f> ty a1k0n, I'm going with the for loop :)
2011-11-03T12:16:15  <a1k0n> plus the value is a pair<key, value>
2011-11-03T12:16:34  <conor_f> yeah

2011-11-03T12:20:32  <AVAVT> is there anyway for me to debug the bot at runtime? I never coded in a system using 2 different languages so I don't know about it. There should be a way right?

2011-11-03T12:28:32  <Minthos> yeah it's called goto
2011-11-03T12:28:41  <conor_f> so like for(...){ for(...){ continue; } }
2011-11-03T12:28:42  <luizribeiro> conor_f: depends. which language are you using?
2011-11-03T12:28:45  <conor_f> C++
2011-11-03T12:28:54  <conor_f> Minthos: I thought goto; was bad to use?
2011-11-03T12:28:57  <luizribeiro> yeah, then use goto
2011-11-03T12:29:03  <conor_f> ok
2011-11-03T12:29:17  <Minthos> conor_f: it's only bad when something else is more suitable, and in this case there isn't
2011-11-03T12:29:19  <luizribeiro> conor_f: it is, but I'm sure your ants won't complain about it
2011-11-03T12:29:21  <thestinger> goto is fine as long as you're going "down" in the code, and not introducing any new variables between goto and the label

2011-11-03T12:30:55  <thestinger> you can't save any persistent state between matches
2011-11-03T12:31:08  <maysam> between turns u mean?
2011-11-03T12:31:20  <Minthos> if you want to keep track of ants between turns, you must write the code to do so yourself
2011-11-03T12:31:23  <thestinger> no, your bot is running for a whole game
2011-11-03T12:31:31  <thestinger> you can save whatever you want between turns
2011-11-03T12:31:38  <maysam> so i can store stuff in class variables

2011-11-03T14:27:42  <roflmao> using max?
2011-11-03T14:28:17  <marijnfs> yeah i use inverse distance

2011-11-03T14:36:20  <thestinger> not atm, I added defense but it was useless
2011-11-03T14:36:26  <roflmao> just park 4 ants on the diagonal corners of your hills

2011-11-03T14:51:38  <thestinger> you can precompile stuff and include it in the package.zip
2011-11-03T14:51:50  <mleise> theoretically there isn't even a standard asm syntax for C(++)
2011-11-03T14:53:56  <thestinger> being able to use numpy+scipy is a pretty big advantage for python

2011-11-03T15:42:57  <conor_f> is it a good idea to start this over again and have an ant class and mess around with the bits not done in the starter packages?

2011-11-03T15:53:15  <marijnfs_> and status
2011-11-03T15:53:15  <Minthos> but basically it goes like this: "hg init" to create a repo, hg add * to track all the files, then hg ci -m "blablabla" to commit

2011-11-03T15:53:28  <amstan> sure.. then you get status and log, so you can see what's happening

2011-11-03T17:01:47  <Zao> conor_f: Includes are pretty much textual substitution of the contents into the place where the directive is.
2011-11-03T17:02:07  <Zao> conor_f: When you compile a source file, all that matters is the final text of the postprocessed source file.

2011-11-03T17:02:50  <Zao> conor_f: The C++ (and C) compilation model is that each source file is individually preprocessed and compiled in isolation, and the resulting object files later on linked together into a single executable/library.

2011-11-03T17:03:18  <Zao> In your case, one of the headers will be included before the other one, and you will then end up with one of the classes defined before the other one.

2011-11-03T17:04:22  <Zao> You _can_ treat them as a source file if you tickle your compiler the right way and try to compile it as-is, but it's not anything one does in a normal build.

2011-11-03T17:05:01  <rb_> 21:03 < Zao> You don't compile headers.
2011-11-03T17:05:05  <Zao> conor_f: A good guideline is though: "a header should include/define anything needed to compile if it's the only thing included in an empty source file"
2011-11-03T17:05:09  <NefariousZhen> well I'm not really sure what that is doing, but it's causing the request to come back with zero maps

2011-11-03T17:16:02  <Pisarik> please:)
2011-11-03T17:16:09  <Zao> Minthos: You'd be surprised at how often people come up without the bleakest idea of the compilation model.
2011-11-03T17:16:11  <Minthos> Pisarik: your starting kit should have functions/properties for it
2011-11-03T17:16:30  <Zao> Minthos: Like the one yesterday that thought that templates were just macro-like textual substitution :D
2011-11-03T17:16:48  <Zao> Pisarik: 200x200
2011-11-03T17:16:54  <Zao> Pisarik: It's on the site somewhere.
2011-11-03T17:16:55  <Minthos> Zao: took me a few years to get comfortable with linking object-oriented spaghetti in C++
2011-11-03T17:17:27  <caution> heh, jumped from 3500 to 1500 in one game

2011-11-03T17:20:07  <antimatroid> that's the spirit
2011-11-03T17:20:17  <conor_f> expect to get annoyed at me plenty for being a n00b over the next while lol, thats a warning to everybody ;)
2011-11-03T17:21:04  <antimatroid> i might go back for a third round of sleep at some point
2011-11-03T17:21:13  <antimatroid> i didn't sleep much earlier week, so i'm catching up aha
2011-11-03T17:21:15  <conor_f> gl :P
2011-11-03T17:21:33  <conor_f> can I forward declare an instance of a struct/class?
2011-11-03T17:22:11  <antimatroid> depends what you mean?
2011-11-03T17:22:25  <antimatroid> you can just chuck struct whatever; somewhere then actuallly define it later
2011-11-03T17:22:42  <conor_f> I need to use state, an instance of the State struct
2011-11-03T17:22:47  <Antimony> Does anyone know why the game rate is broken now?
2011-11-03T17:23:16  <conor_f> in my Ant.cpp file. can I forward declare an instance of State?
2011-11-03T17:23:29  <antimatroid> what do you mean for forward declare?
2011-11-03T17:23:55  <conor_f> actually, no. I wouldn't be able to do that. doesn't make sense
2011-11-03T17:24:01  <conor_f> go back to sleep, it's ok :P

2011-11-03T17:37:06  <Zao> conor_f: In the synthesised copy constructor of your type, it's trying to copy one of your fstream members.
2011-11-03T17:37:18  <krishna> Is that a struct of your global state?
2011-11-03T17:37:24  <krishna> You probably want to pass it by reference

2011-11-03T17:42:25  <krishna> conor_f: Two reasons. Like Zao said, it's making a copy of your State object when you pass it by value, and therefor copying all its members. One of your struct's members is an fstream. It doesn't know how to copy an fstream.
2011-11-03T17:42:50  <krishna> conor_f: The second reason is that coping a large object like that isn't cheap.

2011-11-03T18:05:50  <hjax> starting from the target location, mark it as 0, make all adjacent squares 1, and all squares adjacent to them 2 etc. Keep going until you reach the starting ant, then have the ant jsut count down, moving from square 15, to 14, to 13, all the way to 0, perfect pathfinding if i dont timeout doing it
2011-11-03T18:06:08  <hjax> thoughts?
2011-11-03T18:06:12  <conor_f> :)
2011-11-03T18:06:17  <conor_f> that sounds cool lol
2011-11-03T18:06:24  <antimatroid> that's a bfs and a good start :)
2011-11-03T18:06:25  <hjax> i think it will work

2011-11-03T18:07:43  <hjax> antimatroid, ive never read about pathfinding before, so i decided that before i cheat and look anything up id make my own, looks like i came up with an existing one
2011-11-03T18:07:44  <antimatroid> hjax: you can mark all target locations as 0 at once and add them to a "search queue", then while the queue is not-empty take a location off and update informations for adjacent locations that have not been added to the search queue yet
2011-11-03T18:08:03  <antimatroid> hjax: my friend and i came up with that for our tron bot too :)

2011-11-03T18:08:10  <antimatroid> i didn't realise it was bfs until the start of this contest

2011-11-03T18:08:35  <hjax> antimatroid, seems very effective too
2011-11-03T18:09:02  <antimatroid> then a* search is basically just bfs with a heuristic to try and search the squares which are closest to a target first
2011-11-03T18:09:43  <ecarpenter84> whats a good way to use bfs to spread out mya nts

2011-11-03T18:23:46  <hjax> is there a way to get the coordinates of the nearest hill to an ant?
2011-11-03T18:24:02  <Minthos> there are many
2011-11-03T18:24:07  <hjax> or even the coordinates of all of your hills?
2011-11-03T18:24:11  <Rinum> lots of ways to do that
2011-11-03T18:24:40  <Minthos> your starting kit should tell you where your hills are, as long as your ants can see them
2011-11-03T18:25:08  <hjax> wait, found a my_hills function, nvm
2011-11-03T18:29:46  <ecarpenter84> anyone have a good function that upon collision detection tries each other option to get the ant moved

2011-11-03T20:23:50  <amstan> lol: "Your request " http://aichallenge.org/ " was rejected because of its content categorization: "Games"."
2011-11-03T20:24:04  <amstan> looks like we got on a webfilter
2011-11-03T20:24:34  <janzert> being only casually familiar with makefiles myself, how about changing the OBJECTS line to "OBJECTS=$(addsuffix .o, $(basename ${SOURCES}))"
2011-11-03T20:25:09  <amstan> janzert: what's going on with the makefiles?
2011-11-03T20:25:20  <janzert> deleting people's source code :(
2011-11-03T20:25:24  <amstan> how so?
2011-11-03T20:25:42  <janzert> add a test.cpp file to the sources list for example
2011-11-03T20:26:14  <janzert> since it doesn't have a .cc extension the objects currently feeds it directly to the rm command unchanged
2011-11-03T20:26:25  <amstan> oh dear
2011-11-03T20:26:34  <janzert> yes, not good at all
2011-11-03T20:27:34  <hjax> im writing a new piece of code for my bot to handle exponential expansion, which is needed so badly for good functioning of my bot, lets hope it works :)
2011-11-03T20:27:36  <janzert> I'm also not sure why it's deleting debug.txt
2011-11-03T20:28:01  <janzert> shouldn't wipe out people's source but still seems wrong
2011-11-03T20:28:08  <amstan> janzert: it's an entry in the clean dep, i assume you want only code when cleaning
2011-11-03T20:28:17  <amstan> janzert: no.. wiping sources is definatelly a bug, i'll fix it
2011-11-03T20:28:29  <janzert> cleaning should only remove auto generated files though
2011-11-03T20:28:43  <amstan> debug is technically autogenerated
2011-11-03T20:28:53  <janzert> normally only files that another of the make commands generated
2011-11-03T20:29:05  <roflmao> fluxid seems to be frozen

2011-11-03T20:31:38  <hjax> amstan, how many of the 1000 bots that are in queue right now are starter bots?
2011-11-03T20:31:54  <amstan> hjax: not sure, mcleopold was playing with scripts for detecting that
2011-11-03T20:33:09  <hjax> amstan: starter bots should really be limited to two games, and if a bot that crashes/doesnt gather any food, for five games in a row should also be deactivated, one game every three hours is so slow :/
2011-11-03T20:33:25  <amstan> janzert: c, java and pascal are also using the same makefile constructs.

2011-11-03T20:34:26  <janzert> probably less likely to cause a problem there since I think they all use a standard single extension for source files but it'd be best to change them anyway
2011-11-03T20:34:59  <amstan> contestbot: seen flag
2011-11-03T20:34:59  <contestbot> amstan: flag was last seen in #aichallenge 35 weeks, 3 days, 21 hours, 41 minutes, and 34 seconds ago: <flag> BTW, you might want to add a random seed to your engine so food spawns are consistent for debuging, just a suggestion
2011-11-03T20:35:13  <janzert> @seen _flag
2011-11-03T20:35:13  <contestbot> janzert: _flag was last seen in #aichallenge 1 day, 18 hours, 29 minutes, and 19 seconds ago: <_flag> So the player pool is really shallow
2011-11-03T20:35:13  <amstan> was he in here with another name before?
2011-11-03T20:35:32  <amstan> he kinda abandoned his starter package, and it's a submodule
2011-11-03T20:35:58  <amstan> in order to change them we have to fork it
2011-11-03T20:36:00  <janzert> thought _flag is the same person?
2011-11-03T20:36:08  <amstan> idk, probably
2011-11-03T20:36:09  <datachomper_> Does a hill become land after it's captured or does it remain a hill?
2011-11-03T20:36:21  <janzert> but pulling in it in as a regular directory like the rest wouldn't be bad anyway
2011-11-03T20:36:26  <amstan> yeah
2011-11-03T20:36:36  <amstan> i'll do that
2011-11-03T20:37:03  <amstan> what's with make.cmd in the java starter?

2011-11-03T20:38:18  <janzert> _flag: the Makefile as used in the current starter bots has a bit of a nasty bug
2011-11-03T20:38:41  <janzert> i.e. it can delete people's source files when running make clean

2011-11-03T20:39:57  <janzert> the visualizer leaves a small visual there so you can tell where it was, but the engine doesn't tell a bot anything special about the square
2011-11-03T20:40:45  <_flag> I'm pretty sure I was just asked to copy the C++ one
2011-11-03T20:40:58  <caution> can food spawn on a dead hill?
2011-11-03T20:41:00  <amstan> _flag: yes, but the c++ one had that bug too
2011-11-03T20:41:02  <janzert> _flag: yeah, that seems to be where they all originate from
2011-11-03T20:41:05  <Zao> janzert: I've got a vague memory of someone talking about it a few days ago, where they didn't get the right sort of notification in some cases.

2011-11-03T20:41:40  <janzert> Zao: there is no notification when a hill is razed the bot just stop getting updates that a hill is there
2011-11-03T20:41:49  <_flag> Well anyway, it seems to be just because only 3 source files are listed in the "SOURCES" section and if someone adds additional ones it will assume they're not part of the project
2011-11-03T20:41:58  <_flag> Do you guys have a fix you want me to push to git?
2011-11-03T20:42:33  <janzert> _flag: the problem is if someone adds a file to sources that has a different extension
2011-11-03T20:42:54  <janzert> the OBJECTS line as written won't modify the extension but feed it directly to rm
2011-11-03T20:43:01  <janzert> and boom the source file is gone
2011-11-03T20:43:08  <janzert> on make clean that is
2011-11-03T20:43:30  <janzert> you can see the change amstan just checked into the cpp Makefile if you want
2011-11-03T20:43:48  <_flag> Sure, I'll update it

2011-11-03T21:06:19  <ikaros> hjax, try -e parameter
2011-11-03T21:06:26  <janzert> amstan: no, I haven't
2011-11-03T21:06:54  <steaky> the gme rate thing is strange as I checked the rates of my opponents in my last match, and they were all sub-100.... and all inactive

2011-11-03T21:07:25  <amstan> woah! i can spy on the visiors, because a few of them are starting at their profile page
2011-11-03T21:07:42  <anty_m> :P
2011-11-03T21:07:46  <hjax> ikaros: no difference
2011-11-03T21:08:02  <hjax> im one of them amstan
2011-11-03T21:08:15  <amstan> hjax: refresh it a few times so you get bunped up
2011-11-03T21:08:36  <hjax> see me now?
2011-11-03T21:08:41  <amstan> not yet
2011-11-03T21:08:47  <amstan> 5133?
2011-11-03T21:08:54  <hjax> 7816
2011-11-03T21:09:08  <amstan> nope, you're not on the list yet
2011-11-03T21:09:16  <amstan> there's probably a delay
2011-11-03T21:09:27  <hjax> i just refreashed it liek 10 times, ill be there soon lol
2011-11-03T21:09:30  <hjax> like*
2011-11-03T21:09:30  <steaky> rofl - with fluxid do I just change "python MyBot.py" to "java -jar MyBot.jar" to get it to work for java stuff - or is it python only?
2011-11-03T21:10:18  <amstan> hjax: nope
2011-11-03T21:10:20  <janzert> steaky: it'll work for any language but I'm not sure of the correct command
2011-11-03T21:10:35  <janzert> what you have above looks like a good place to start ;)
2011-11-03T21:10:37  <amstan> hjax: also, it's based on visitors,  so you would only appear once then
2011-11-03T21:11:12  <caution> how does the server tell whether an entry is python 2 or 3?
2011-11-03T21:11:43  <amstan> caution: python3 stuff should be submitted with a py3 extension
2011-11-03T21:12:10  <caution> can you add pypy support please?
2011-11-03T21:12:26  <amstan> caution: talk to janzert
2011-11-03T21:13:02  <janzert> caution: there's a possibility but I haven't had time to try it again recently
2011-11-03T21:13:48  <Venom> The bot version number correspond to the number of times you uploaded your bot code, correct?
2011-11-03T21:13:52  <caution> yes
2011-11-03T21:14:02  <Venom> The first rank is currently Xathis
2011-11-03T21:14:10  <Venom> and he's version 1
2011-11-03T21:14:31  <a1k0n> version 1, except for all the versions during the beta
2011-11-03T21:14:31  <Venom> the guy's a genius?
2011-11-03T21:14:34  <anty_m> nothing stops you from making a new username for each upload
2011-11-03T21:14:47  <hjax> anty_m the ban hammer does
2011-11-03T21:14:48  <ccc_> he must have been experimenting in the demo period before the live launch
2011-11-03T21:14:50  <a1k0n> the top users started this months ago
2011-11-03T21:14:52  <Venom> sure, but only if you don't care about getting the ban hammer
2011-11-03T21:15:01  <anty_m> I thought we were still talking about the tcp site
2011-11-03T21:15:04  <a1k0n> which is kind of unfair but it's not like the beta was secret
2011-11-03T21:15:05  <anty_m> whoops
2011-11-03T21:15:06  <Venom> ccc_ , that's what I thought.
2011-11-03T21:15:55  <ccc_> Venom: and yeah, he might be a genius
2011-11-03T21:16:24  <magiik> meh any other better way to debug in c++ than attaching to the process...
2011-11-03T21:16:38  <magiik> there's gotta be some way with MSVC to automate attaching
2011-11-03T21:16:43  <Venom> a1kon: oh well.  so many things could be considered unfair if you really want to find things.   :)   I'll take a month off from my job to concentrate on the contest. Is that unfair? :P
2011-11-03T21:16:45  <hjax> how can i see what caused my bot to crash? from the play_one_game.bat
2011-11-03T21:16:45  <ccc_> printf all the lines
2011-11-03T21:16:47  <anty_m> I thought switching languages would be a good way to learn a new language, but it's just sapping my will to participate
2011-11-03T21:17:10  <Venom> ccc_: yes, he might.
2011-11-03T21:17:18  <amstan> Venom: people have done that before
2011-11-03T21:17:42  <magiik> then it takes you forever to parse through your debug logs lol
2011-11-03T21:17:44  <Venom> Venom: I totally see why. This is pretty addictive.
2011-11-03T21:17:51  <magiik> talking to urself?
2011-11-03T21:18:01  <magiik> and yes this damn contest is addictive
2011-11-03T21:18:10  <magiik> it's successfully weaned my work hours off of reddit though
2011-11-03T21:18:14  <magiik> and onto this lol
2011-11-03T21:18:17  <a1k0n> Venom: technically i have a month off from my job
2011-11-03T21:18:17  <Venom> haha, awesome.  missclicked :P
2011-11-03T21:18:24  <a1k0n> (but that's because we just had a baby)
2011-11-03T21:18:42  <magiik> god that reminds me... i really should do some work
2011-11-03T21:18:42  <Venom> magiik: killed my reddit time too.
2011-11-03T21:18:51  <Venom> a1kon: congrats :)
2011-11-03T21:19:06  <magiik> yeah it's amazing, i havn't been to reddit in like 3 days now ( cept on my phone )
2011-11-03T21:19:25  <anty_m> a1kon: lol, now I'm picturing a crying baby and frustrated new mother in the background as you tweak ants
2011-11-03T21:19:45  <anty_m> a1kon: also, congrats :)

2011-11-03T21:20:07  <ccc_> when you receive input and put all the data in your datastructures, in the next turn when you get input again, do you loop through your datastructres again to see which ones to remove?
2011-11-03T21:20:22  <a1k0n> anty_m: heh, pretty much.  don't forget the bored 3 year old running around the house
2011-11-03T21:20:25  <ccc_> I mean you have to remove dead ants if any right
2011-11-03T21:20:27  <hjax> can anyone help me? idk how to get output from python crashing on my machine when testing
2011-11-03T21:20:48  <anty_m> hjax: the python logging module is awesome
2011-11-03T21:20:58  <anty_m> just pipe the logging output to a file
2011-11-03T21:21:24  <hjax> anty_m: ummm, what about when python crashes? im just looking for the traceback
2011-11-03T21:21:29  <anty_m> or just open a file and print to it if you don't want to learn/use the logging module
2011-11-03T21:22:05  <anty_m> hjax: I think everything in stdout and stderr is suppressed by the game engine, so you've gotta use a file
2011-11-03T21:22:11  <magiik> python crashes it should dump a traceback right there
2011-11-03T21:22:20  <magiik> no it isn't
2011-11-03T21:22:22  <magiik> use --capture-errors
2011-11-03T21:22:24  <janzert> singularity hub did a really nice and in depth write up http://singularityhub.com/2011/10/26/googles-ai-challenge-who-can-build-the-smartest-ant-colony/

2011-11-03T21:22:46  <magiik> and it will print stderr from ur bots on the screen

2011-11-03T21:23:28  <magiik> but yeah, i do my debuging output to a file anyways - it's easier to handle than on the screen
2011-11-03T21:23:37  <magiik> but the stderr to the screen is nice for when u crash ur bot

2011-11-03T21:35:59  <bobbydroptable> still trying to figure out how momobot does such a nice spread of ants :(
2011-11-03T21:36:03  <magiik> there were at least like 2 or 3 bots in that first battle
2011-11-03T21:36:08  <magiik> that were doing all kinds of battle dancing
2011-11-03T21:36:10  <magiik> with formations and shit

2011-11-03T21:36:18  <Dimentox> c# generics are nice for that stuff
2011-11-03T21:36:20  <roflmao> just gotta get the right bfs weights
2011-11-03T21:36:38  <scombinator> How'd they get predicitive with all that combat and stuff
2011-11-03T21:36:41  <bobbydroptable> yeh i'm playing around with the weights
2011-11-03T21:36:43  <anty_m> for my first bot, all I did was avoid squares I'd already visited for a while, and it did surprisingly OK.
2011-11-03T21:36:59  <luizribeiro> the good bots really use minimax for combat?
2011-11-03T21:37:07  <luizribeiro> I mean, minimax sounds costly, even with alpha-beta pruning
2011-11-03T21:37:18  <amstan> scombinator: minimax, aka computing all possible futures a few turns ahead and picking the best course of action
2011-11-03T21:37:34  <hjax> you can chaise xathis off because he doesnt want to loose a few ants
2011-11-03T21:37:51  <Dimentox> THis is old my contrib to openmetaverse.  ive been doing NPC ai in sl since 2k8.. Now i use raycasting with nav meshes etc. instead of bitmapping the field. http://jira.openmv.org/secure/attachment/10465/AStar.cs
2011-11-03T21:38:05  <Dimentox> a good fast astar is nice but you have to use it sparsely
2011-11-03T21:38:16  <Dimentox> the above is hardly optimised for this type fof thing.
2011-11-03T21:38:32  <roflmao> luiz — maybe a little
2011-11-03T21:38:36  <roflmao> but yeah minimax is a bit costly
2011-11-03T21:38:38  <luizribeiro> I mean, if you have 4 ants for each side, that gives you 8 ants and 8*4 = 32 different possible moves on each turn
2011-11-03T21:39:03  <luizribeiro> even if you're simulating for only a few turns, that will grow up very fast

2011-11-03T21:40:34  <Dimentox> I am worknig on for my combat is to just have a 4 move distance limiter and if the ants in that area outnumber retreat and move in more ants... then once overpowered  move in.. then redistribute for other atatcks or tasks ... the key i see is avoidance and also blocking  pathways with clustering so you can kill hives
2011-11-03T21:40:45  <luizribeiro> anyway, it's very costly. minimax doesn't sound feasible

2011-11-03T21:48:11  <bobbydroptable> The System.Threading.Timer class makes callbacks on a ThreadPool thread and does not use the event model at all.
2011-11-03T21:48:58  <bobbydroptable> that's system.threading.timer though...
2011-11-03T21:49:43  <bobbydroptable> i'm going to throw in a guess here and say "probably not"
2011-11-03T21:51:32  <Dimentox> nothing to stop from writing your own scheduler... that does not OS thread
2011-11-03T21:52:15  <bobbydroptable> epoll would be quite cpu intensive and wouldn't add much benefit though, i think?
2011-11-03T21:52:43  <bobbydroptable> the python starter pack just checks time elapsed since the turn started and doesn't do anything if nearing time limit

2011-11-03T22:47:24  <clckwrk> C and yes I modified io code.
2011-11-03T22:47:32  <clckwrk> but followed rules and specifications.
2011-11-03T22:47:47  <clckwrk> didnt' like how starter package wanted reiteration over already read data.
2011-11-03T22:48:07  <amstan> you should be able to give manually give your bot the game data through stdin
2011-11-03T22:48:09  <amstan> see what happens
2011-11-03T22:48:30  <clckwrk> even with modification of IO code how can it work with play_one_game and test_bot then?
2011-11-03T22:48:44  <clckwrk> shouldn't they all not work?
2011-11-03T22:48:48  <Dimentox> should work on just stdin and stdout

2011-11-03T22:51:10  <Extrarius> so, from this chat, it sounds like there is a lot of basic graph searching being used as the primary component of the bot - anybody using any anything beyond pathfinding, like goal planning or squad-based tactics etc?

2011-11-03T22:56:28  <Dimentox> schooliing is the same thing you see in the mob mentality with fish...
2011-11-03T22:56:28  <clckwrk> amstan let me ask this, should each series of moves from the bot be surrounded with go\nmove\nmove\ngo?
2011-11-03T22:56:41  <SharkMonkey> No
2011-11-03T22:56:47  <clckwrk> even after the go after ready/
2011-11-03T22:56:50  <Venom> is this the same thing as swarming?
2011-11-03T22:56:51  <amstan> clckwrk: i don't know, you can look at the other starter packages and see how they behave in comparassion to yours
2011-11-03T22:56:52  <Dimentox> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence

2011-11-03T22:57:08  <Extrarius> flock of birds, school of fish - nearby agents influence the actions of eachother
2011-11-03T22:57:15  <Dimentox> i define in my stuff flocking as a follow teh leader type
2011-11-03T22:57:22  <Dimentox> schooling to me is more swarm

2011-11-03T23:01:57  <Dimentox> maybe throw a finally which handles a random movement

2011-11-03T23:02:24  <hjax> also it's not deciding to go after food properly,
2011-11-03T23:03:15  <hjax> Dimentox: I did that, and it's not running, do some previous code is crashing and the bot thinks that it executed

2011-11-03T23:12:49  <Extrarius> hjax: I'm using influence maps/potential fields for navigation
2011-11-03T23:12:58  <Dimentox> see i am doing some role based stuff... But what i am going to give priority to is retreat and swarming ... where say you have 3 ants near you within a set range... you retreat and summon the rest to have just enough to overwhelm and win the fight then detach and go  do your tasks.

2011-11-03T23:16:25  <caution> does the tcpserver 1v1 if no-one else joins after a while?
2011-11-03T23:16:26  <SharkMonkey> caution, The tcp server is pretty popular. I'm guessing it's just frozen now

2011-11-03T23:27:32  <Dimentox> just thinkin its mac vs linux

2011-11-03T23:28:20  <clckwrk> yeah I'm wondering the same, although newline should be the same. especially when the bot is compiled remote.
2011-11-03T23:28:49  <scombinator> Ugh. If I rewrite in C I'll know what is going on
2011-11-03T23:29:07  <Dimentox> afk a few need food
2011-11-03T23:29:15  <scombinator> Does the C starter have hill handling yet?
2011-11-03T23:29:44  <SharkMonkey> What will rewriting in C accomplish?
2011-11-03T23:30:12  <scombinator> Transparency - I'll know what's actually going on, and no allocation will magically appear within a tight loop
2011-11-03T23:30:48  <clckwrk> AFAIK C starter does not have hill handling.
2011-11-03T23:31:25  <clckwrk> I rewrote because I was unhappy with the starter code...forced me to iterate over this array that I wasn't too keen on.
2011-11-03T23:31:46  <SharkMonkey> It's a trivial feature to add. case 'h':
2011-11-03T23:31:56  <clckwrk> easier to build in movement and hill handling during line parses instead of having to read the map and then iterate over it to get what I want.
2011-11-03T23:32:19  <scombinator> If it's trivial, why isn't it there?
2011-11-03T23:33:13  <SharkMonkey> You could be the one to contribute an updated starter bot :)
2011-11-03T23:33:25  <scombinator> Whoa... the cbot starter sucks
2011-11-03T23:33:51  <Dimentox> clk if you upload the cbot does it compile?
2011-11-03T23:34:21  <scombinator> Why on earth does it create a map, then search the map for food and ants?
2011-11-03T23:34:25  <SharkMonkey> Most of them do. But they don't suck in a way that should matter much. Focus on the hard interesting stuff before procrastinating and the silly stuff.

2011-11-03T23:52:37  <ccc> in my MacOS i was clearly using out-of-range index but it never seg-faulted and i thought everything is good, but I had to run my program in ubuntu to finally realize my mistake. What a headache i had to just resolve just a small thing
2011-11-03T23:52:38  <Dimentox> eats and tries bed
2011-11-03T23:53:00  <avdg> Dimentox: in that case, try to stay up ;-)
2011-11-03T23:53:04  <Dimentox> LOl
2011-11-03T23:53:12  <Dimentox> ccc good point

2011-11-03T23:53:25  <Dimentox> clck maybe try to cvompile on a linux box?
2011-11-03T23:53:42  <scombinator> Which OS does the actual comp use?
2011-11-03T23:53:50  <Dimentox> think its linux
2011-11-03T23:53:50  <SharkMonkey> linux
2011-11-03T23:53:52  <avdg> ubuntu natty
2011-11-03T23:54:00  <ccc> tournament uses Ubuntu 64bit
2011-11-03T23:54:07  <Dimentox> gcc4 tends to be rather buggy with c
2011-11-03T23:54:14  <avdg> hmm, wasn't the system 32 bit (could be wrong)
2011-11-03T23:54:28  <SharkMonkey> Is that what OS X uses?
2011-11-03T23:54:36  <Dimentox> osx is bsd

2011-11-03T23:55:32  <SharkMonkey> clckwrk, as ccc hints, definitely look into compiler and platform differences masking subtle bugs...
2011-11-03T23:55:35  <avdg> SharkMonkey: OS X is the operating system of a mac ;-)
2011-11-03T23:55:48  <SharkMonkey> I mean is gcc4 what it uses
2011-11-03T23:55:48  <Dimentox> its bsd kernel based
2011-11-03T23:55:52  <Dimentox> no
2011-11-03T23:56:45  <Dimentox> and you compileing with xcode?
2011-11-03T23:56:51  <Dimentox> you can install gcc
2011-11-03T23:57:33  <ccc> yeah after installing xcode you get gcc along with many other things.
2011-11-03T23:58:00  <clckwrk> yeah I dont' think it's an OS X thing, it's a fucking bug that I've introduced I'm almost positive of it.  How many times have you been writing code and blaming the OS and it turns out to be your fault.  it might be subtle differences, but I've treid to minimize those or sure.
2011-11-03T23:58:12  <Dimentox> LOL
2011-11-03T23:58:22  <Dimentox> most of the time for me its microsofts libs
2011-11-03T23:58:25  <Dimentox> and headers
2011-11-03T23:58:30  <Dimentox> lol
2011-11-03T23:58:36  <Dimentox> if i am on linux
2011-11-03T23:58:38  <clckwrk> the fact that the specification and the tools are questonable doesn't make it any easier though.
2011-11-03T23:58:41  <Dimentox> its ually my fault
2011-11-03T23:58:44  <Dimentox> cause i am drunk
2011-11-03T23:58:51  <SharkMonkey> clckwrk, We aren't blaming OSX. At least I'm not. Overflows and things trigger differently on different platforms. It could easily be the other way around.
2011-11-03T23:58:59  <ccc> clckwrk: why do say they are questionable?
2011-11-03T23:59:12  <Dimentox> nope
2011-11-03T23:59:15  * avdg is blaming himself for placing files at the wrong place
2011-11-03T23:59:19  <Dimentox> just saying maybe its one of those trange tings
2011-11-03T23:59:42  <clckwrk> ccc: the mere fact that I can run play_one_game and test_bot on my platform with no error and have timeouts on the target system leaves something to be desired.
