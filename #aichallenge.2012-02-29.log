2012-02-29T05:10:38  <mcstar> ^^ antimatroid's idea of an abstract poem
2012-02-29T05:10:51  <antimatroid> nah, literally saw a guy fall through a window before
2012-02-29T05:10:54  <mcstar> you should at least work yourself up to the length of a haiku though
2012-02-29T05:10:56  <antimatroid> pretty much cut himself to the bone
2012-02-29T05:11:17  <antimatroid> whilst sitting next to me on a handrail
2012-02-29T05:11:26  <antimatroid> i was halfway through telling him how much of a bad idea it was
2012-02-29T05:11:34  <mcstar> lol
2012-02-29T05:11:44  <mcstar> did he bleed?
2012-02-29T05:11:47  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-02-29T05:11:51  <mcstar> haha
2012-02-29T05:11:52  <antimatroid> friend and i didn't realise at first
2012-02-29T05:11:59  <mcstar> thats nice
2012-02-29T05:12:00  <antimatroid> then saw the blood and followed it to find him
2012-02-29T05:12:04  <antimatroid> and took him down to the ambo
2012-02-29T05:12:11  <antimatroid> then i went and picked up as much glass as i coudl
2012-02-29T05:12:24  <mcstar> "followed it to find him" wtf/
2012-02-29T05:12:26  <mcstar> ?
2012-02-29T05:12:46  <mcstar> why did you need to follow the blood
2012-02-29T05:13:00  <mcstar> wasnt it obvious that he cut himself?

2012-02-29T05:13:55  <mcstar> what happened?
2012-02-29T05:14:03  <mcstar> he lost balance and broke the glass?
2012-02-29T05:14:48  <mcstar> i had a similar episode in high-school
2012-02-29T05:15:19  <mcstar> well, ive got to finish moping, but pls, keep coming the details

2012-02-29T05:23:13  <mcstar> anyway, better luck for your pal next time
2012-02-29T05:26:24  <antimatroid> we were both sitting on a handrail, and he leaned back and down heaps onto a non-laminated window
2012-02-29T05:26:26  <antimatroid> terrible idea
2012-02-29T05:26:38  <antimatroid> friend and i didn't realise he was cut at first until we saw the blood leading away
2012-02-29T05:26:52  <antimatroid> he was surrounded by friends who were trying to call an ambo but we took him off to an ambo which was already there
2012-02-29T05:27:01  <antimatroid> (societies day at the uni)
2012-02-29T05:29:55  <mcstar> lol, same here, for uni-wide festivities we had ambulance too :)
2012-02-29T05:30:27  <mcstar> so, he did all this to skip class?
2012-02-29T05:34:01  <mcstar> when it happened to me, i was sitting an a radiator, just below a window, and my buddies were pushing me, for fun, like young people fool around, and i broke the window with my head, and the whole glass came down, and *just* missed my neck, i was lucky, cause i wore a leather jacket, and couldnt cut it
2012-02-29T05:38:36  <antimatroid> nah, societies day is like 3-6pm and the idea is to sign up societites in exchange for beer
2012-02-29T05:38:48  <antimatroid> what he did was pretty stupid
2012-02-29T05:39:10  <antimatroid> he could have leant against the building fine but leaned down more into the dinwo
