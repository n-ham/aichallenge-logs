2011-09-01T13:06:15  <deeper-blue> my gene encodes commands, every command contains the amount of ships to be send from one planet to another and encodes the turn in which this is supposed to happen

2011-09-01T13:07:30  <Makaveli> hi there
2011-09-01T13:07:40  <deeper-blue> the simulation is basically playing against a worst case scenario
2011-09-01T13:08:09  <Makaveli> I'm having problems with the Visualizer
2011-09-01T13:08:30  <Makaveli> I can run the game well and the replay files also get created, no problems
2011-09-01T13:08:31  <deeper-blue> every gene gets a score and only the better genes survive in a gene pool which I use to generate new genes
2011-09-01T13:08:46  <Makaveli> but all that happens afterwards is that my firefox opens a page saying that the visualizer is being loaded and the canvas is being created
2011-09-01T13:08:51  <Makaveli> nothing happens afterwards though
2011-09-01T13:08:53  <Makaveli> anybody any idea?
2011-09-01T13:09:22  <Makaveli> tried running visualize_locally.py supplying the .replay file as input, same scenario

2011-09-01T14:31:39  <Makaveli> hi
2011-09-01T14:31:45  <Makaveli> having problems with the visualizer...
2011-09-01T14:31:53  <Makaveli> running a game runs fine, using the visualizer doesn't
2011-09-01T14:32:04  <Makaveli> it gets stuck at "Creating Canvas" it seems....
2011-09-01T14:32:07  <Makaveli> using firefox, latest version
2011-09-01T14:32:11  <Makaveli> anyone any idea?

2011-09-01T14:44:44  <berak> Makaveli, got no idea, but it might help, if you tell if you're using the tools.zip version, or the one from github. also, can you see the games on http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com ?
2011-09-01T14:45:32  <Makaveli> yes I can
2011-09-01T14:45:35  <Makaveli> I am using tools.zip

2011-09-01T16:08:22  <mcstar> Makaveli: describe what you do exactly
2011-09-01T16:08:58  <Makaveli> All I do is extract the tools folder (or the general AI folder I've downloaded from your source now) and then go into the visualizer folder...
2011-09-01T16:09:08  <Makaveli> this time I tried to run the example already provided
2011-09-01T16:09:14  <Makaveli> same problem
2011-09-01T16:09:23  <mcstar> if the beta site loads with the visualizer, theres no reason the downloaded visualizer wouldnt work, as berak suggested
2011-09-01T16:09:23  <Makaveli> the path is OK

2011-09-01T16:10:05  <mcstar> so, you run play_one_game.sh
2011-09-01T16:10:12  <Makaveli> that's exactly why this is so frustating
2011-09-01T16:10:15  <mcstar> and then a browser window opens
2011-09-01T16:10:18  <mcstar> ?
2011-09-01T16:10:28  <Makaveli> exactly
2011-09-01T16:10:33  <Makaveli> after the game has created the demo
2011-09-01T16:11:10  <mcstar> how recent are those browsers?
2011-09-01T16:11:34  <mcstar> ok i see
2011-09-01T16:11:51  <UncleVasya> Makaveli: mleise is the one who made visualizer. He can tell you all pre-requirements for it if they exist. Also I think he has a much better chance to guess where is the problem.

2011-09-01T16:13:49  <delt0r_> Did you get a dialog box or 2 that asked about giving permission for the JS to access things when you run locally?
2011-09-01T16:14:14  <mcstar> firefox always asked for me
2011-09-01T16:14:22  <mcstar> chromium didnt as far as i know
2011-09-01T16:14:29  <delt0r_> basically IIRC "strict" security could bork the JS player
2011-09-01T16:14:34  <mcstar> sry, asked me for*
2011-09-01T16:15:06  <mcstar> you mean could break?
2011-09-01T16:15:07  <Makaveli> well I got one on IE9
2011-09-01T16:15:09  <delt0r_> mcstar: it only asked me locally.... i think.... since i hit the "don't ask me again"
2011-09-01T16:15:14  <delt0r_> it could have been both
2011-09-01T16:15:21  <Makaveli> but Firefox never asked
2011-09-01T16:15:41  <mcstar> heh, every setup is different i guess
2011-09-01T16:15:54  <delt0r_> Makaveli: well i put money on that you have that set to deny and don't ask again
2011-09-01T16:16:06  <delt0r_> but not real money

2011-09-01T16:17:32  <delt0r_> setting in FF are a PITA
2011-09-01T16:17:39  <mcstar> delt0r_: now give him a clue on how to make the browser re-ask the security question :)
2011-09-01T16:17:40  <delt0r_> IMO anyway
2011-09-01T16:17:45  <Makaveli> it works on http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com... so why shouldn't it work locally?
2011-09-01T16:17:55  <delt0r_> on linux i would delete .mozilla
2011-09-01T16:17:58  <delt0r_> :D
2011-09-01T16:18:03  <mcstar> different source of gameplay data
2011-09-01T16:18:16  <delt0r_> I have not used windows for a decade
2011-09-01T16:18:40  <mcstar> the web visualizer asks the http server for the replay data
2011-09-01T16:18:48  <delt0r_> about:config
2011-09-01T16:18:50  <mcstar> but the local visualizer pulls it from a file
2011-09-01T16:18:52  <delt0r_> something like IIRC
2011-09-01T16:18:58  <delt0r_> always have to google it
2011-09-01T16:19:24  <mcstar> im not sure how its dont exactly, what i did before, is that i assempled a html file with the visualizer js code and replay data
2011-09-01T16:19:35  <mcstar> marco solved it more elegantly i believe
2011-09-01T16:20:03  <mcstar> the problem, is that a browser's js engine cant access the local filesystem
2011-09-01T16:20:16  <mcstar> at least not directly
2011-09-01T16:20:23  <Makaveli> just tried running everything on a local webhost
2011-09-01T16:20:27  <Makaveli> apache to be exact
2011-09-01T16:20:29  <Makaveli> still no worky :p
2011-09-01T16:20:32  <delt0r_> well tbh --this is not really what js was meant for...
2011-09-01T16:20:56  <mcstar> dont->done
2011-09-01T16:21:07  <delt0r_> Makaveli: what about a virgin install of FF--ie find where ever the setting are stored and nuke it
2011-09-01T16:21:15  <delt0r_> probably the registry ;)
2011-09-01T16:21:25  <mcstar> delt0r_: he is on osx i believe
2011-09-01T16:21:32  <UncleVasya> delt0r: Are you planning to include in JAntManager a possibility to start game with hand-maided position? Like 10 Player1's ants vs 25 Player2's
2011-09-01T16:21:34  <Makaveli> nope I'm on windows
2011-09-01T16:21:38  <mcstar> oh
2011-09-01T16:21:45  <mcstar> you use cygwin then?

2011-09-01T16:21:54  <delt0r_> UncleVasya: had not got that far
2011-09-01T16:21:56  <Makaveli> what for?
2011-09-01T16:22:06  <mcstar> Makaveli: you said you run play_one_game.sh
2011-09-01T16:22:10  <mcstar> you couldnt on windows
2011-09-01T16:22:12  <delt0r_> but wasn't thinking of doing anything like that this time around
2011-09-01T16:22:24  <Makaveli> oh I'm sorry, play_one_game.cmd
2011-09-01T16:23:01  <mcstar> then, my guess is that the html file couldnt be assembled correctly
2011-09-01T16:23:17  <Makaveli> looks just like the template
2011-09-01T16:23:26  <mcstar> Makaveli: you sure youve got the right python version, and the game runs without errors?
2011-09-01T16:23:49  <Makaveli> yes, the python version is 2.7
2011-09-01T16:24:03  <Makaveli> mleise just told me something weird "Oh yeah looks like I broke it" let's see :-)

2011-09-01T16:37:33  <UncleVasya> The pain from 'cooking' contest's staff you feel only once. When it's done the only thing you really need is your ideas to improve starter bot. High programming skills and mathematics (game theory) will help but it's not necessery if you don't want to be in very top.
2011-09-01T16:39:56  <mcstar> well, i think time is of the essence, the man with the most free time will win
2011-09-01T16:40:05  <mcstar> because he can explore more ideas
2011-09-01T16:40:10  <Makaveli> well, you might also win with a very simple solution though
2011-09-01T16:40:20  <Makaveli> it's not an open game... as in it's not like chess...
2011-09-01T16:40:45  <UncleVasya> The inability to handle with js, linking, setuping libraries etc. isn't matter. The ability to produce and write thoughts for bot is the key,

2011-09-01T16:41:37  <mcstar> exp(iPi)

2011-09-01T16:42:55  <Makaveli> haha no

2011-09-01T16:43:25  <Makaveli> but honestly if you can't setup something as easy as the visualizer tool (I'm speaking about the setup) you really should think about participating, don't you think so?
2011-09-01T16:43:40  <UncleVasya> No, I don't
2011-09-01T16:44:13  <Makaveli> really?
2011-09-01T16:44:24  <mcstar> actually, it requires no setup
2011-09-01T16:44:32  <mcstar> except having the right python
2011-09-01T16:44:59  <mleise> almost there
2011-09-01T16:45:39  <mcstar> mleise: you forgot to comment on the first change
2011-09-01T16:46:24  <mleise> mcstar: no it is all there in the next line ;)
2011-09-01T16:46:35  <mleise> now it is minifying the JavaScript ...
2011-09-01T16:48:34  <UncleVasya> As I already pointed setuping contest and writing bot are totally different things. If someone is messy with all these files (.bat, .py, .js, .html - wow!) it doesn't means he can't make a good bot. During bot programming he will use all the tools he is familiar with (IDE, language) and will show himself.
2011-09-01T16:49:28  <mleise> A side note: play_one_game_live  behaves more like PlanetWars. It pipes the output of the engine into the Java visualizer, but starts playback immediately.
2011-09-01T16:49:48  <mcstar> omg
2011-09-01T16:49:54  <mcstar> mleise: how did you do that?
2011-09-01T16:50:01  <mcstar> aham
2011-09-01T16:50:05  <mcstar> java
2011-09-01T16:50:07  <mcstar> not js
2011-09-01T16:50:31  <mleise> I worked out a crazy solution, that's how I did it.
2011-09-01T16:50:37  <mcstar> hehe
2011-09-01T16:50:45  <mcstar> care to share? im interested
2011-09-01T16:50:46  <mleise> by the way Makaveli, you can download the new file now
2011-09-01T16:51:12  <mleise> mcstar: sure, what do you want to know?
2011-09-01T16:51:27  <mcstar> the answer to everything of course
2011-09-01T16:51:32  <mleise> 42
2011-09-01T16:51:40  <mcstar> hell, its on my cup even
2011-09-01T16:51:58  <mcstar> now seriously, how did you pipe the data to the visualizer?
2011-09-01T16:52:13  <Makaveli> mleise thanks a lot
2011-09-01T16:52:17  <UncleVasya> I wanna see your evil smile at moment when 'crasy solution' wasborn in your mind :)
2011-09-01T16:52:30  <mleise> The engine has some switches. You use -So to output the 'streaming format'
2011-09-01T16:52:52  <mcstar> ok, it writes to a regular file?
2011-09-01T16:53:10  <mleise> No it writes to stdout
2011-09-01T16:53:17  <mcstar> ah k
2011-09-01T16:53:19  <mleise> And the visualizer reads from stdin
2011-09-01T16:53:33  <mcstar> yeah, but what is that visualizer?
2011-09-01T16:53:43  <mcstar> it still runs in the browser
2011-09-01T16:53:48  <mcstar> is it not?
2011-09-01T16:54:00  <mleise> Most of the visualizer is generic JavaScript
2011-09-01T16:54:35  <UncleVasya> A motivating guy goes to bed. Bye.

2011-09-01T16:54:44  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!kvirc@178-133-33-126.dialup.umc.net.ua> has quit IRC ()
2011-09-01T16:54:45  <mleise> To get it into an applet for IE <9 and reuse it as a standalone application, I had to use Rhino, a JavaScript->Java compiler
2011-09-01T16:55:09  <mcstar> ok, so the thing is that java runs in the browser
2011-09-01T16:55:31  <mcstar> and the browser can be invoked with its stdin read by the java engine
2011-09-01T16:56:06  <mleise> Obviously Java doesn't have the web interface that is exposed to a JS application in a browser, most prominently the canvas is missing, but also other things like local storage, DOM, ...
2011-09-01T16:56:25  <mleise> So I had to implement these things in Java
2011-09-01T16:56:25  <mcstar> (obviously?)
2011-09-01T16:56:52  <mcstar> i see, so it was quite some work
2011-09-01T16:57:01  <mleise> The JavaScript specs don't describe what the a browser is meant
2011-09-01T16:57:04  <mleise> to expose
2011-09-01T16:57:25  <mleise> It just comes with some basic functions for string manipulation, math and so on
2011-09-01T16:57:41  <mcstar> ok
2011-09-01T16:57:49  <mleise> Yes, it was quite some work, but it is *way* faster on IE <9 now
2011-09-01T16:58:02  <mcstar> and what about other browsers?
2011-09-01T16:58:14  <mcstar> can you compile js to java for them too?
2011-09-01T16:58:19  <mleise> Previously I only ported the canvas into an applet and had even more crazy stuff going on in IE
2011-09-01T16:58:39  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-71-231-166-135.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-01T16:59:05  <mcstar> ah, here goes a sweet welcome to McLeopold
2011-09-01T16:59:09  <mleise> mcstar: Java is 'compile once, run everywhere'. Just add '&java=true' to any replay on the server
2011-09-01T16:59:43  <mcstar> aham, so effectively rhino is multi-platform
2011-09-01T16:59:45  <mleise> This loads the Java applet even if the browser supports all the HTML5 features
2011-09-01T16:59:53  <mleise> Java is cross-platform
2011-09-01T16:59:59  <mcstar> i know that :)
2011-09-01T17:00:05  <mleise> Rhino is written in Java  :)
2011-09-01T17:00:12  <mcstar> but that first sentence sounded like it only runs on ie9
2011-09-01T17:00:57  <mcstar> (sry, <ie9, but still windows)
2011-09-01T17:00:58  <mleise> ah, no. IE 8,7,6 ... don't support the HTML canvas and are generally not very standard conformant. for these I added the applet in the first place
2011-09-01T17:01:04  <mleise> because java works well in them
2011-09-01T17:01:27  <mcstar> so, in the end it turned out its faster than js
2011-09-01T17:01:28  <McLeopold> hi
2011-09-01T17:01:43  <mcstar> hi
2011-09-01T17:02:05  <mleise> Don't expect JavaScript compiled to Java to be fast. It is a type-less language which adds a *lot* of overhead. And my canvas implementation is single-threaded. Other browsers execute JS and draw at the same time
2011-09-01T17:02:25  <Makaveli> mleise you tested the new version right?
2011-09-01T17:02:49  <mleise> Makaveli: I tested the Linux part of it, in a few scenarios
2011-09-01T17:02:58  <Makaveli> I'm running on windows :(
2011-09-01T17:03:06  <Makaveli> did you update the one on http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/ or the other one?
2011-09-01T17:03:17  <mleise> @tools
2011-09-01T17:03:18  <Makaveli> same problem sadly :/
2011-09-01T17:03:18  <contestbot> mleise: tools could be Windows: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip | Linux/MacOS X: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.tar.bz2.
2011-09-01T17:05:45  <mcstar> im gonna clone the repo for fun
2011-09-01T17:06:34  <Zannick> "for fun"
2011-09-01T17:07:30  <mcstar> what? i die for the progress indicator, thats the only reason i have slow net
2011-09-01T17:08:25  <mleise> you could use win95 defrag, it has a very cool progress indicator
2011-09-01T17:08:36  <mleise> it fills the screen and you can scroll it
2011-09-01T17:09:53  <mcstar> sweet memories, though i only used 98 at home
2011-09-01T17:10:25  <mcstar> i remember my computer kept crashing under it, people told me, my hardware was too good for that os
2011-09-01T17:10:31  <mcstar> than came xp
2011-09-01T17:11:22  <mleise> Makaveli: It *should* work, the fix is in the zip file
2011-09-01T17:11:30  <mcstar> Makaveli: it works for me, i saw what you saw, after accepting the security something, the visualizer shows up
2011-09-01T17:12:30  <mcstar> ans sadly its slower than ever
2011-09-01T17:12:31  <mcstar> d
2011-09-01T17:12:35  <mcstar> ff7
2011-09-01T17:12:41  <mleise> nooooooo, why?
2011-09-01T17:13:03  <mcstar> dunno
2011-09-01T17:13:09  <mcstar> chromium rocks
2011-09-01T17:15:25  <mleise> maybe its because i worked with chromium too much. its simply faster ^^
2011-09-01T17:16:45  <mcstar> what are those?
2011-09-01T17:16:47  <mcstar> ^^
2011-09-01T17:16:55  <mcstar> double exponentiation?
2011-09-01T17:17:05  <mcstar> line the Knuth symbol?
2011-09-01T17:17:18  <mleise> no they are smiley eyes
2011-09-01T17:17:40  <mcstar> line->like
2011-09-01T17:17:42  <mcstar> aham
2011-09-01T17:17:51  <mcstar> couldnt have guessed that
2011-09-01T17:18:02  <Makaveli> I'll give it another shot...
2011-09-01T17:18:29  <mcstar> Makaveli: that poor toolkit's gonna be a swiss cheese with all those holes from your shots in it
2011-09-01T17:18:36  <mleise> sometimes written as ^_^
2011-09-01T17:18:54  <mcstar> mleise: i see, thx, that one i can recongnize
2011-09-01T17:20:01  <Makaveli> mcstar: was that actually just coincidence or did you know that I reside in Switzerland? :-)
2011-09-01T17:20:32  <mcstar> im tracking you IP, and own your life HAHAHA
2011-09-01T17:20:40  <mleise> mcstar: you can use h4X like: &config={"cp":1}
2011-09-01T17:20:41  <mcstar> pure coincidence tbh
2011-09-01T17:21:00  <mleise> to burn more CPU on the visualizer if it is too slow, hehe
2011-09-01T17:21:27  <mleise> sorry, cpu instead of cp
2011-09-01T17:21:35  <mcstar> i was about to ask :)
2011-09-01T17:22:23  <mleise> or "cpu":0.1 to show everyone how badly i optimized
2011-09-01T17:23:18  <mleise> Since it is a config value, clicking on the save button will save that setting in your browser
2011-09-01T17:23:28  <mleise> the default is 0.5
2011-09-01T17:24:45  <mcstar> mleise: sry, i see no difference
2011-09-01T17:24:52  <mcstar> 0.1-10
2011-09-01T17:25:12  <mleise> I see a *big* difference
2011-09-01T17:25:27  <mleise> for example I use: http://localhost/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game=9&debug=true&config={%22cpu%22:0.1}
2011-09-01T17:25:33  <mcstar> oh, forgot to mention, my os runs on an nvidia gpu
2011-09-01T17:25:54  <mleise> Your OS doesn't run on the GPU -.-
2011-09-01T17:26:00  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-01T17:26:18  <mcstar> maybe debug is needed?
2011-09-01T17:26:42  <mleise> no, it just prints the FPS in the title
2011-09-01T17:26:57  <mleise> (and loads corrupt replays)
2011-09-01T17:27:39  <mleise> Makaveli: Does play_one_game_live work for you on Windows in case you have Java 6 or higher installed?
2011-09-01T17:29:02  <mcstar> mleise: with cpu:0.1 fps is like 4, with cpu:1 fps is 40, but i dont feel any difference
2011-09-01T17:29:57  <mleise> 40 FPS? great!
2011-09-01T17:30:42  <mcstar> but obviously theres something wrong
2011-09-01T17:31:06  <mcstar> with cpu:0.1, with 4 fps, the slider is as fast as with 40, and the screen updates rapidly, not with 4 fps
2011-09-01T17:31:11  <mleise> McLeopold: the new visualizer code does handle your special replays better. I made it slower in the general case to be faster when displaying static maps with 1000 ants
2011-09-01T17:32:02  <mleise> mcstar: so you say you actually have more than 4 fps?
2011-09-01T17:32:16  <mcstar> well, i must, otherwise it would be sluggisg
2011-09-01T17:32:18  <mcstar> h
2011-09-01T17:32:20  <mcstar> it isnt
2011-09-01T17:32:34  <mleise> ???
2011-09-01T17:32:55  <mcstar> when you set cpu:0.1, can you feel the visualizer actually slow down?
2011-09-01T17:33:15  <mleise> yes, it becomes a real slideshow @ 1 FPS
2011-09-01T17:33:29  <mcstar> wait a minute
2011-09-01T17:33:33  <mcstar> you play it?
2011-09-01T17:33:37  <mcstar> >
2011-09-01T17:33:38  <mleise> maybe up the playback speed a bit
2011-09-01T17:33:56  <mleise> it only affects the playback speed, yes
2011-09-01T17:34:30  <mcstar> argh, you could have told me that
2011-09-01T17:34:34  <mcstar> now its 45 fps
2011-09-01T17:34:40  <mcstar> with playback
2011-09-01T17:34:40  <mleise> On planet wars some people complained that the visualizer is using to much cpu juice, so I throttled it *g*
2011-09-01T17:35:01  <McLeopold> mleise: cool for the faster 1000 ant games :)
2011-09-01T17:35:43  <mleise> McLeopold: the attack lines - I used an n*n algorithm to find ants that are in attack range of each other
2011-09-01T17:36:12  <mcstar> thats another simley i wont figure out: n*n
2011-09-01T17:36:19  <mcstar> is it like *g* ?
2011-09-01T17:36:36  <mleise> no it is a mining vehicle
2011-09-01T17:36:41  <McLeopold> so O(n2)?
2011-09-01T17:36:53  <mleise> more like O(n¬≤)
2011-09-01T17:36:58  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-01T17:37:05  <McLeopold> yea, that
2011-09-01T17:37:21  <mcstar> McLeopold: you dont have full unicode keyboard?
2011-09-01T17:37:29  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-01T17:38:01  <mleise> That is sad, because Œ± Œ≤ and so on come handy sometimes
2011-09-01T17:38:22  <mleise> It is a bit large though with its 20 * 31 meters
2011-09-01T17:38:34  <Zannick> that's a big keyboard
2011-09-01T17:38:46  <McLeopold> I don't even have a numeric keypad :(
2011-09-01T17:38:54  <mcstar> it doubles as a carpet for him
2011-09-01T17:38:57  <Zannick> i don't think my apartment is 20 meters
2011-09-01T17:39:08  <mleise> yes, but they wanted to include the runes and the snowman
2011-09-01T17:39:11  <Zannick> no, wait, it might be
2011-09-01T17:39:31  <mcstar> Zannick: you cant really compare m to m^2
2011-09-01T17:39:32  <Zannick> well, my car certainly isn't.

2011-09-01T17:42:01  <mcstar> i mean theres a little gap
2011-09-01T17:42:03  <Zannick> i'm not sure how to make that one

2011-09-01T17:45:51  <Zannick> black is white!
2011-09-01T17:47:11  <mleise> no it is black!

2011-09-01T17:47:17  <mleise> your unicode font is racist
2011-09-01T17:47:19  <mcstar> its is white
2011-09-01T17:47:45  <mcstar> no, but i do use a black-background terminal
2011-09-01T17:47:57  <mcstar> so fonts are white
2011-09-01T17:48:04  <mleise> oh wait then... ‚òπ is black?

2011-09-01T19:09:20  <delt0r_> cool --my engine still can manage about 300-600 turns per sec with more than  2000 ants and a 500x500 map
2011-09-01T19:09:32  <delt0r_> good for training :)
2011-09-01T19:09:49  <delt0r_> also that is with debug logging

2011-09-01T19:37:38  <mleise> :-D wow well done. looks like it was worth the effort.
2011-09-01T19:38:58  <mleise> delt0r_: Did you process any commands at all?
2011-09-01T19:41:52  <mleise> Try a map of 120x120 and 1000 ants that give orders. That would be real life case. How many turns do you get out of the engine then?
2011-09-01T19:43:47  <mleise> I guess you also optimized the visibility calculations quit a bit
2011-09-01T19:43:51  <delt0r_> mleise: yes every ant get an order every turn
2011-09-01T19:43:56  <delt0r_> yes
2011-09-01T19:44:18  <delt0r_> amstan: I had another look at JSkills
2011-09-01T19:44:42  <delt0r_> I think that loop can just be exited with a warning without issues...

2011-09-01T19:45:04  <delt0r_> its a approximate iterative solver more or less
2011-09-01T19:45:35  <delt0r_> and when there is a draw --its gets into a very slowly reducting delta per iteration.
2011-09-01T19:46:06  <delt0r_> so if maxIter is something like 1000 then i think it will just boil down to how to split ties
2011-09-01T19:46:09  <delt0r_> I think
