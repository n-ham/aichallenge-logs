2012-04-04T11:59:24  <ramn> but it seems there is no community anymore?

2012-04-04T12:20:21  <smiley1983> the code I'm running is my fork here: https://github.com/smiley1983/ants-tcp
2012-04-04T12:20:35  <smiley1983> I think the Ants component is pretty much identical to berak's
2012-04-04T12:21:05  <smiley1983> it's easy to set up; just unzip, and run tcpserver.py and webserver.py
2012-04-04T12:21:48  <ramn> ah nice, thanks
2012-04-04T12:22:04  <smiley1983> you can then connect to localhost for local testing, or open the relavent ports so others can access it
2012-04-04T12:22:56  <ramn> perfect
2012-04-04T12:23:14  <ramn> how is timeout handled,
2012-04-04T12:23:32  <ramn> are you raising the timeout setting when running bots over the net?
2012-04-04T12:26:55  <smiley1983> I think it lies to the players about the time available; says they have 500ms and gives them a few seconds
2012-04-04T12:27:09  <smiley1983> so the bots should behave properly unmodified
2012-04-04T12:29:17  <ramn> ah nice
2012-04-04T12:30:03  <smiley1983> Previously there were cutoffs which would end the game (if food wasn't being gathered, for example) - I took them out but could put them back in.
2012-04-04T12:33:33  <ramn> probably good for noob-bots :)

2012-04-04T12:40:29  <smiley1983> I spent way too much time on an over-engineered pathfinding system
2012-04-04T12:40:59  <ramn> nice :)
2012-04-04T12:41:04  <ramn> sounds like fun
2012-04-04T12:41:48  <smiley1983> it performs a few breadth first searches every turn, but it caches paths to "beacons" and then searches across the beacon network
2012-04-04T12:42:31  <ramn> ok, and the beacons, are they calculated aswell, or hardcoded?
2012-04-04T12:43:07  <smiley1983> I don't remember how long it took for a complete bfs of the largest maps, but it was too long to do very many of them (>30?) per turn
2012-04-04T12:43:32  <smiley1983> the beacons were created and updated dynamically as the map was explored
2012-04-04T12:43:56  <ramn> ok, like choke points into new areas? or center of large areas?
2012-04-04T12:44:38  <smiley1983> however, note that other people had successful bots which didn't cache paths; they used A* rather than bfs, and were smart about how they used it
2012-04-04T12:45:38  <smiley1983> I had plans for optimizing the placement of beacons; as it was, it just placed a new beacon whenever it discovered a tile which was more than a certain distance from the closest beacon
2012-04-04T12:45:46  <ramn> ok, I've hacked together an A* so far
2012-04-04T12:46:34  <ramn> but beacons seems iteresting - the analysis for deciding beacons answers many questions I take it
2012-04-04T12:46:50  <ramn> ah
2012-04-04T12:47:08  <ramn> ok so you had a more coarse graph overlay, basically
2012-04-04T12:47:29  <ramn> with cached routes (optimal?) between them
2012-04-04T12:48:02  <ramn> did you do area analysis of some sort
2012-04-04T12:49:03  <smiley1983> no area analysis beyond marking tiles with heatmap information (either by bfs or distance from a point)
2012-04-04T12:49:40  <smiley1983> the beacons allowed hundreds of searches where I could only afford a few dozen bfs
2012-04-04T12:50:48  <smiley1983> every tile was marked with distance to the nearest few beacons, which made the bridge between coarse and fine graphs
2012-04-04T12:51:41  <smiley1983> as well as xathis' writeup, I think a1kon's is particularly well worth reading - very different approaches, both very effective

2012-04-04T15:18:16  <antimatroid> well, not even that
2012-04-04T15:19:02  <a1k0n> i never did a proper writeup of my ants thing

2012-04-04T15:20:00  <a1k0n> i did no path finding at all, just various kinds of bfs
2012-04-04T15:20:22  <smiley1983> antimatroid: do you remember how many searches you could do on the largest maps?
2012-04-04T15:21:28  <antimatroid> not sure, way more than 30
2012-04-04T15:22:04  <smiley1983> I remember being a bit surprised by how few I was managing (many more if I limited the search radius, but with 200x200 it wasn't that many)

2012-04-04T15:23:16  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-04-04T15:23:28  <antimatroid> i had big problems making sure my bot would play alright on large maps
2012-04-04T15:23:36  <Zannick> yeah, i didn't do a* at all for ants
2012-04-04T15:23:40  <Zannick> :3
2012-04-04T15:23:49  <antimatroid> i tried but it was slower
