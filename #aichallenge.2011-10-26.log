2011-10-26T00:00:49  <bobbydroptable> hey admins, there seems to be different types of battle resolution (attack,focus,closest,support). is it going to be stuck to "focus?
2011-10-26T00:01:47  <McLeopold> focus is here to stay
2011-10-26T00:03:05  <burny> hrm.. what's focus?
2011-10-26T00:03:31  <bobbydroptable> that's the name of the current battle resolution scheme
2011-10-26T00:03:41  <bobbydroptable> i'm doing some test maps to see how formations will work in chokes
2011-10-26T00:03:41  <bobbydroptable> :D
2011-10-26T00:03:59  <burny> ah, ok
2011-10-26T00:04:07  <burny> thought it was a certain stage of combat lol
2011-10-26T00:04:28  <janzert> bobbydroptable: you can block a <3 wide area
2011-10-26T00:04:41  <bobbydroptable> yes
2011-10-26T00:04:43  <bobbydroptable> that's what i've realised
2011-10-26T00:04:52  <bobbydroptable> anything wider than that and there will be exchanges

2011-10-26T00:07:17  <janzert> working on  a response :)
2011-10-26T00:07:32  <janzert> McLeopold: Most of the new coloring looks better I think, but the white numbers on the bar graphs seem worse
2011-10-26T00:08:36  * janzert has been thinking about replacing the A/Z button with an options button that would pop up a options dialog of some sort

2011-10-26T00:09:14  <avdg> if I may assuming they heard it
2011-10-26T00:09:29  <janzert> we could then add color themes in there and we wouldn't have to worry quite so much about the color blindness issue for the main theme
2011-10-26T00:09:51  <janzert> also could have themes suitable for red-green color blindness and other types separately

2011-10-26T00:10:37  <McLeopold> I agree, pushing these colors to vars was the first step
2011-10-26T00:10:55  <McLeopold> I can make the bars use the black text, or sand color
2011-10-26T00:11:22  <janzert> I think black will probably work best, but sand color might be interesting to see

2011-10-26T00:17:12  <nishant> alright
2011-10-26T00:17:17  <nishant> but can you help me here?
2011-10-26T00:17:18  <McLeopold> nishant: did you compile a jar file?
2011-10-26T00:17:29  <janzert> to answer your question though, that looks like an incorrect classpath of some sort
2011-10-26T00:17:33  <nishant> i used the make file provided
2011-10-26T00:17:43  <nishant> and tried compiling all java files manually
2011-10-26T00:17:46  <McLeopold> it was updated yesterday, I think, when did you get it last?
2011-10-26T00:17:58  <McLeopold> and, windows or mac/linux?
2011-10-26T00:18:02  <nishant> sometime yeaterday itself
2011-10-26T00:18:08  <janzert> also what's the command line you're giving to playgame?
2011-10-26T00:18:09  <nishant> im on a linus machine
2011-10-26T00:18:21  <nishant> ./playgame.sh
2011-10-26T00:18:28  <McLeopold> yes, the make file was bad, make sure you update
2011-10-26T00:18:46  <nishant> i will try once again
2011-10-26T00:18:49  <McLeopold> basically, it wasn't putting all the classes in the jar file
2011-10-26T00:18:59  <McLeopold> the jar file is just a zip file, you can unzip it to check
2011-10-26T00:19:06  <amstan> McLeopold: have you seen the new VERSION file?
2011-10-26T00:19:08  <janzert> but what is the command in the .sh being feed to playgame.py?
2011-10-26T00:19:15  <bmh> Is there any programmatic way to submit?
2011-10-26T00:19:26  <McLeopold> amstan: no?
2011-10-26T00:19:28  <amstan> bmh: you're welcome to make one
2011-10-26T00:19:33  <amstan> McLeopold: download a starter package

2011-10-26T00:19:57  <amstan> bmh: it's probably just a wget
2011-10-26T00:20:11  <janzert> amstan: it would have to get a login session first though
2011-10-26T00:20:20  <amstan> 2 wgets
2011-10-26T00:20:20  <nishant> i tried the new version
2011-10-26T00:20:24  <bmh> yeah -- wget posting the uname password and file
2011-10-26T00:20:26  <nishant> version file is
2011-10-26T00:20:49  <nishant>     Really fixed java Makefile. Added jar to be a proper target in the makefile
2011-10-26T00:21:32  <amstan> nishant: java -jar MyBot.jar gives you this?
2011-10-26T00:22:00  <nishant> no
2011-10-26T00:22:06  <amstan> can you try that?
2011-10-26T00:22:12  <nishant> amstan: it just hangs
2011-10-26T00:22:22  <amstan> that seems about right
2011-10-26T00:22:39  <bmh> amstan: I need to find a teammate in Europe and another one in East Asia so we can follow the sun :)
2011-10-26T00:22:44  <nishant> amstan: the program seems to be running but maybe the script is fawed
2011-10-26T00:23:36  <nishant> it apparently cant find the class file "AbstractSystemInputParser$SetupToken.class"
2011-10-26T00:23:41  <amstan> bmh: or you can do polyphasic sleep
2011-10-26T00:23:52  <nishant> however, when i see the compiled files its there

2011-10-26T00:28:36  <a1k0n> antimatroid: re: tracking enemies in unseen territory.  yes, that's pretty much what i was thinking... construct a rough probability distribution of where enemy ants might be given where/when you last saw them
2011-10-26T00:28:49  <bmh> a1k0n: I hate you, that was my plan :)

2011-10-26T00:29:05  <a1k0n> well ,this contest is mostly for individuals

2011-10-26T00:29:21  <bmh> That's what you would say, you're an individual.
2011-10-26T00:29:28  <antimatroid> a1k0n: yeah but i said perhaps you could just skip the probability aspect and track information about the most recent turn you saw an enemy ant that could reside in a square outside view
2011-10-26T00:29:33  <amstan> a1k0n: i would do it, he has cool ideas
2011-10-26T00:29:36  <a1k0n> the problem of profitting from that information decision-wise is still pretty open
2011-10-26T00:30:04  <bmh> amstan: Of all people, I think a1k0n needs my ideas the least.
2011-10-26T00:30:04  <a1k0n> antimatroid: i would argue that there's an implicit probability distribution in such an assumption which you can basically just ignore
2011-10-26T00:30:06  <antimatroid> no probabilities involved there, just work out how to correctly propogate that info or whatever
2011-10-26T00:30:27  <antimatroid> yeah, with probabilities i imagine it'd put more weight on squares with more access to them?
2011-10-26T00:30:46  <antimatroid> whereas this would be more the ant has equal probability of being in any square reachable
2011-10-26T00:30:53  <a1k0n> i guess.  you could say there's a sort of diffusion coming from all anthills among the "routes" on the map

2011-10-26T00:31:37  <a1k0n> anyway a similar argument can be made for food, except it's uniformly distributed plus symmetry
2011-10-26T00:31:46  <a1k0n> which can be used to motivate exploration
2011-10-26T00:31:46  <bmh> Given that we have limited computational resources, I'm wondering if it's smarter to just devote the lion's share of the resource to foraging

2011-10-26T00:32:49  <antimatroid> i'm a big fan of if it's possible then it's fair game, but i have done what i can to hide the symmetry from you :P
2011-10-26T00:33:04  <a1k0n> too bad the code to produce maps is open
2011-10-26T00:33:11  <antimatroid> why is that too bad?

2011-10-26T00:33:20  <bmh> a1k0n: Whatever, they can just swap out the map code in the end

2011-10-26T00:40:11  <janzert> I'd prefer going to black text on the bar graphs but what's there would be ok I suppose
2011-10-26T00:40:17  <bmh> a1k0n: That certainly looks more efficient
2011-10-26T00:40:26  <McLeopold> amstan: the problem is we also allow for bot stderr, so I don't want to fill up the database with chatty bots
2011-10-26T00:40:39  <McLeopold> janzert: it is black text
2011-10-26T00:40:44  <a1k0n> bmh: it is if you take advantage of the fact that oyu can do it via FFTs, otherwise it's expensive
2011-10-26T00:40:57  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i can't believe you didn't finish uni :P
2011-10-26T00:40:59  <janzert> amstan: we should only be storing 1024 bytes of output now and it's overflowing a 4096 length field
2011-10-26T00:41:13  <amstan> wtf?
2011-10-26T00:41:17  <janzert> McLeopold: ahh, needed a browser refresh
2011-10-26T00:41:19  <a1k0n> so like, water = 1, ground = -1, unexplored = 0, do a 2D FFT, multiply itself by its conjugate, find largest magnitudes
2011-10-26T00:41:21  <janzert> amstan: right
2011-10-26T00:41:37  <a1k0n> largest one should be at the translation offset
2011-10-26T00:41:41  <janzert> McLeopold: looks good to me
2011-10-26T00:41:54  <amstan> a1k0n: what if it's a mirror symmetry, or translational?
2011-10-26T00:42:02  <amstan> err, rotational
2011-10-26T00:42:06  <a1k0n> antimatroid: i'm a horrible student of subjects i don't want to take at the moment
2011-10-26T00:42:22  <a1k0n> amstan: then you have to do something else with the boundary conditions; i haven't worked it out yet
2011-10-26T00:42:27  <a1k0n> amstan: but it finds translational ones out of the box
2011-10-26T00:42:42  <a1k0n> amstan: actually you'd do convolution instead of autocorrelation
2011-10-26T00:43:01  <bmh> a1k0n: What should I put in my milk so I can grow up big and strong like you?
2011-10-26T00:43:02  <amstan> and i managed to not get either of those terms, lol
2011-10-26T00:43:19  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i'm in the same boat, i've almost failed units from a lack of effort :P
2011-10-26T00:43:40  <a1k0n> bmh: haha.  i was vegan for a while
2011-10-26T00:44:06  <bmh> a1k0n: pescatarian here.
2011-10-26T00:44:07  <a1k0n> bmh: but am too lazy to pass up things with milk and cheese

2011-10-26T00:44:23  <antimatroid> i would go vegetarian but i think i'd run out of food i am willing to eat
2011-10-26T00:44:30  <a1k0n> it's pretty easy.
2011-10-26T00:44:33  <bmh> antimatroid: try Ethiopian.
2011-10-26T00:44:39  <antimatroid> bmh: :P
2011-10-26T00:44:39  <a1k0n> especially if there's mexican food on every corner where you live
2011-10-26T00:44:42  <McLeopold> time to piss everyone off with another color change :)
2011-10-26T00:44:49  <bmh> a1k0n: Do you think this symmetry detector is actually worthwhile?
2011-10-26T00:44:54  <bmh> a1k0n: are you in the Mission?
2011-10-26T00:44:56  <antimatroid> bmh: yes
2011-10-26T00:44:56  <amstan> colour chane \o/
2011-10-26T00:45:02  <antimatroid> detecting symmetry gives you a lot of infor
2011-10-26T00:45:16  <bmh> antimatroid: like where their hill is.
2011-10-26T00:45:23  <antimatroid> and where water is
2011-10-26T00:45:35  <antimatroid> and where food might be
2011-10-26T00:45:47  <bmh> food is whereever not water is?
2011-10-26T00:45:49  <a1k0n> bmh: heh, no, i live in sunnyvale
2011-10-26T00:45:53  <janzert> McLeopold: is there a reason not to make the captured length configurable?
2011-10-26T00:45:57  <antimatroid> food is added to the map symmetrically from ant hills
2011-10-26T00:46:11  <antimatroid> a1k0n: as in sunnyvale goon?
2011-10-26T00:46:14  <a1k0n> so it's a bit of an exaggeration
2011-10-26T00:46:14  <bmh> a1k0n: Palo Alto here
2011-10-26T00:46:16  <janzert> having a longer capture for compile errors than game errors might be nice in the future
2011-10-26T00:46:16  <antimatroid> aka cheap wine?
2011-10-26T00:46:24  <bmh> antimatroid: oh. That is a lot of info
2011-10-26T00:46:26  <McLeopold> janzert: because we also capture bot stderr
2011-10-26T00:46:27  <a1k0n> antimatroid: as in what?
2011-10-26T00:46:36  <a1k0n> antimatroid: as in california
2011-10-26T00:46:50  <janzert> yes? but that is the reason to make it configurable
2011-10-26T00:46:51  <McLeopold> janzert: uh, if you can tell the difference, sure
2011-10-26T00:46:56  <antimatroid> a1k0n: http://www.homeliquordelivery.com.au/images/sunnyvale%20fruity%20lexia.JPG
2011-10-26T00:47:01  <janzert> ok
2011-10-26T00:47:07  <antimatroid> that might be australian though
2011-10-26T00:47:19  <a1k0n> antimatroid: what... is that?
2011-10-26T00:47:19  <McLeopold> We can up the database and still not increase the limit of HeadTail
2011-10-26T00:47:33  <antimatroid> a1k0n: it's a $10 cask of wine
2011-10-26T00:47:36  <janzert> what I'm thinking is we would capture more when running the compiler, less when running the bot in a game
2011-10-26T00:47:49  <McLeopold> Actually, those are in different database fields
2011-10-26T00:47:52  <a1k0n> bmh: anyway, symmetry detector is not worthwhile until you have a basic probabilistic based bot.. which i don't have yet
2011-10-26T00:47:54  <janzert> right
2011-10-26T00:48:16  <antimatroid> a1k0n: what about water info and hill info?
2011-10-26T00:48:23  <antimatroid> and number of players
2011-10-26T00:48:48  <janzert> but let's not change any of the actual capture lengths yet, until I/we get the current issue with too long of captures sorted out
2011-10-26T00:48:49  <a1k0n> antimatroid: well, once you're certain about the symmetry, then yeah, that would help a ton
2011-10-26T00:48:54  <a1k0n> you can immediately start zerg rushing the other anthills
2011-10-26T00:49:11  <antimatroid> have people done much on defending their hill strategies?
2011-10-26T00:49:14  <bmh> a1k0n: sure you don't want to join team skynet? ;)
2011-10-26T00:49:22  <McLeopold> janzert: did you already up it or did I/
2011-10-26T00:49:27  <bmh> we use haskell
2011-10-26T00:49:27  <antimatroid> like making sure there's a permiter around it for which you know there's no enemies in there
2011-10-26T00:49:31  <bobbydroptable> I'm having trouble even getting started :D
2011-10-26T00:49:32  <janzert> I haven't touched it
2011-10-26T00:49:45  <janzert> what is it actually?
2011-10-26T00:49:49  <a1k0n> hmm
2011-10-26T00:49:50  <McLeopold> game errors are at 1024, submission errors at 4096
2011-10-26T00:49:50  <antimatroid> bmh: you're skynet :P
2011-10-26T00:49:56  <antimatroid> you should be sky captain
2011-10-26T00:50:00  <antimatroid> from lapd future cpp
2011-10-26T00:50:02  <a1k0n> were the rules modified since the last contest?  it used to explicitly forbid teams
2011-10-26T00:50:08  <antimatroid> no it didn't
2011-10-26T00:50:12  <antimatroid> teams were always allowed

2011-10-26T00:50:17  <antimatroid> a friend and i did our tron bot together
2011-10-26T00:50:20  <janzert> it's been 4096
2011-10-26T00:50:21  <a1k0n> really?!
2011-10-26T00:50:23  <antimatroid> pairs were allowed in tron
2011-10-26T00:50:27  <a1k0n> ah.
2011-10-26T00:50:30  <antimatroid> they just said say so on your profile
2011-10-26T00:50:46  <a1k0n> and now you can actually edit your profile
2011-10-26T00:50:50  <antimatroid> haha yeah
2011-10-26T00:51:21  <antimatroid> i can't wait to do tron again
2011-10-26T00:51:28  <a1k0n> heh
2011-10-26T00:51:45  <McLeopold> with ant maps...
2011-10-26T00:51:50  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-26T00:52:00  <antimatroid> yes, i wanted bigger maps for tron anyway
2011-10-26T00:52:02  <antimatroid> they were way too small
2011-10-26T00:52:18  <a1k0n> bmh: it might be best, since i don't have a lot of time for the contest this time.  i spend most of my time these days keeping my 3 year old from waking up the infant and vice versa
2011-10-26T00:52:44  <bmh> a1k0n: Do you like Haskell?
2011-10-26T00:52:52  <antimatroid> bmh: oh i thought you were skyramp?
2011-10-26T00:52:55  <a1k0n> i do, but i don't know if i'd use it for this
2011-10-26T00:52:57  <antimatroid> how many sky people are there!
2011-10-26T00:53:02  <a1k0n> skynet
2011-10-26T00:53:10  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-10-26T00:53:10  <bmh> antimatroid: Like the guy who killed John Connor
2011-10-26T00:53:15  <a1k0n> which was a starter bot last i checked, heh
2011-10-26T00:53:20  <antimatroid> there is a skyramp on the leaderboard
2011-10-26T00:53:33  <bmh> a1k0n: That is correct. It's been a busy two weeks. I recently moved London -> CA and started a new job
2011-10-26T00:53:45  <antimatroid> bmh: what kind of work do you do?
2011-10-26T00:53:58  <bmh> antimatroid: I'm a software engineer
2011-10-26T00:54:05  <antimatroid> that's not very descriptive :P
2011-10-26T00:54:11  <antimatroid> what kind of software do you make
2011-10-26T00:54:14  <amstan> bmh: aren't you a googler?
2011-10-26T00:54:25  <bmh> amstan: yeah.
2011-10-26T00:54:26  <janzert> McLeopold: heh, and I just now realize that the compiler doesn't use HeadTail at all?

2011-10-26T00:54:27  <antimatroid> so many googlers!

2011-10-26T01:01:21  <antimatroid> so i expect decent bots from them if they continue

2011-10-26T01:16:38  <amstan> woot for the orange ant: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=14313
2011-10-26T01:18:06  <bobbydroptable> lol sure sucks to be him
2011-10-26T01:18:39  <amstan> he's a survivor
2011-10-26T01:18:44  <analyst74> did pretty well though, ranked #2
2011-10-26T01:18:46  <amstan> he also destroys an anthill
2011-10-26T01:18:49  <bobbydroptable> urgh seriously youtube? a 5 year old video and you want to impose copyright on the music? jeez ...

2011-10-26T01:27:07  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, don't worry about it
2011-10-26T01:27:48  <antimatroid> the ants are very electric
2011-10-26T01:27:55  <McLeopold> I'm actually rotflmao over here
2011-10-26T01:27:56  <amstan> McLeopold: i can do those "really fix" commits that break stuff too.
2011-10-26T01:28:24  <antimatroid> have we considered decreasing the speed of games a bit? it's pretty hard to see what's going on when it moves so fast
2011-10-26T01:28:30  <antimatroid> and we can't make it go any slower
2011-10-26T01:28:40  <amstan> problem is that at this point you can't push -f stuff you ammended anymore since there's too many people watching
2011-10-26T01:28:44  <McLeopold> wow, still broken :(
2011-10-26T01:28:52  <janzert> antimatroid: the speed depends on the length of the game
2011-10-26T01:29:06  <antimatroid> janzert: sure, but the current length and speed is quite fast
2011-10-26T01:29:16  <janzert> even for short games?
2011-10-26T01:29:20  <janzert> or just for long ones?
2011-10-26T01:29:26  <antimatroid> just for longer i guess
2011-10-26T01:29:37  <amstan> McLeopold: one more equal?
2011-10-26T01:29:37  <antimatroid> wouldn't it be better to have a constant speed per turn as default?
2011-10-26T01:29:45  <antimatroid> rather than constant time for the game to be visualised in
2011-10-26T01:29:48  <amstan> antimatroid: +1 for that
2011-10-26T01:30:06  <janzert> I think it's nice to try and go for constant time until that constant time gets too fast
2011-10-26T01:30:24  <antimatroid> did planet wars do constant time?
2011-10-26T01:30:29  <amstan> probably
2011-10-26T01:30:41  <janzert> don't really remember
2011-10-26T01:30:44  <McLeopold> amstan: actually, I don't think that's it
2011-10-26T01:30:46  <antimatroid> at the very least it would be nice if we could slow the game down from the default
2011-10-26T01:30:50  <antimatroid> and not just speed it up
2011-10-26T01:30:54  <amstan> McLeopold: mostly kidding
2011-10-26T01:30:55  <janzert> antimatroid: you can
2011-10-26T01:31:13  <McLeopold> http://paste.aichallenge.org/0G5ci/?user=871
2011-10-26T01:31:14  <janzert> you can slow it way down
2011-10-26T01:31:31  <janzert> the second from bottom button on the right, with the snail in black
2011-10-26T01:31:36  <antimatroid> last time i checked i don't think i could and i can't check atm :P
2011-10-26T01:31:50  <antimatroid> yeah last time i tried it wouldn't let you slow it down any further than the default starting length
2011-10-26T01:31:51  <janzert> I have it playing at about 1 move per second at the moment
2011-10-26T01:31:56  <antimatroid> only speed it up then slow it back down to that
2011-10-26T01:32:01  <antimatroid> hmm okay
2011-10-26T01:32:05  <antimatroid> i'm fine then
2011-10-26T01:32:33  <janzert> yeah, if you couldn't slow beyond the default speed it would be bad

2011-10-26T01:58:15  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: When watching a game for the "focus" player, and that player wins the match so that their score and ant count bars are on the far left, the white bar color blends into the white background and the score ant ant count numbers seem to be floating because there is nothing to separate them from the "scores" and "# of ants" labels
2011-10-26T01:58:56  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: A vertical black bar to separate the label from the numbers might help.
2011-10-26T01:59:02  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: really? I guess I shouldn't have used red and green
2011-10-26T01:59:03  <janzert> instead of pure white a light gray would probably fix it as well

2011-10-26T03:30:17  <f4hy> open high food maps, my ant does well though
2011-10-26T03:30:47  <Puj> Sounds like you may need better defense conditions? f4hy
2011-10-26T03:30:54  <bobbydroptable> probably need to be more evasionary

2011-10-26T03:33:39  <Israfel> I'm still getting started. I'm digging around trying to see how the game interfaces with the bot still.
2011-10-26T03:33:59  <f4hy> Puj: ya, my defense normally kicks in after a certain threshold of ants, but on low food maps, I dont get enough to trigger it. gonna have to reconsider

2011-10-26T03:36:15  <Israfel> f4hy, Why do they favor all going north?
2011-10-26T03:36:21  <Puj> I guess your defense threshold is around 30 ants f4hy?
2011-10-26T03:36:41  <bobbydroptable> because when you have directions = ['n','s','e','w'] they're going to do that
2011-10-26T03:36:42  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-26T03:36:55  <paulwal> When moving an ant, the documentation says to output "o row col direction".   Are row and col the originating tile or the destination tile?  To move an ant at 3,18 northward, would you output "o 3 18 N" or "o 3 17 N"  ?
2011-10-26T03:37:08  <bobbydroptable> origin tile
2011-10-26T03:37:18  <f4hy> Israfel: Lol, I have "if you dont know what to do yet go north" I have thought about what the default behavoir should be, but doesnt really matter much I dont think
2011-10-26T03:37:20  <bobbydroptable> so 3 18 n

2011-10-26T03:37:27  <bobbydroptable> which goes to 2 18
2011-10-26T03:37:37  <paulwal> ohhh
2011-10-26T03:37:41  <paulwal> of course
2011-10-26T03:37:54  <Israfel> f4hy, yeah, they're covering ground already covered by other ants. Spread them out.
2011-10-26T03:37:58  <bobbydroptable> f4hy could take advantage of that... put lots of defenses facing south lol
2011-10-26T03:38:05  <paulwal> i was thinking in terms of x,y.  As in x first.  But.. row then col.  Thanks
2011-10-26T03:38:08  <Puj> f4hy, consider implementing a proportional calculation, distance ants can go from hill in direct relation to # of ants where when you have two ants, the second ant never leaves vision of the hill, then you can release this condition when you reach the threshold you currently have implemented?
2011-10-26T03:38:11  <bobbydroptable> knowing that the bots will never come from the north XD
2011-10-26T03:38:38  <bobbydroptable> Puj: but this reduces the speed at which you gather food, because you're now dependent on drops happening in that region.
2011-10-26T03:38:43  <bobbydroptable> i think

2011-10-26T03:39:18  <bobbydroptable> the 1st ant can't defend anyway

2011-10-26T03:39:33  <bobbydroptable> track how long it takes to get your first food
2011-10-26T03:39:38  <Israfel> A game should have several phases. the first being fast expansion for resources.
2011-10-26T03:39:39  <f4hy> Puj: On low food maps you have to get as much food as posisble so all ants need to be gathering
2011-10-26T03:39:59  <f4hy> Israfel: obviously, but on low food maps, my ants never transition to phase 2
2011-10-26T03:40:03  <Puj> Undoubtedly, but on low food maps, it is better to not lose, than to win.
2011-10-26T03:40:07  <f4hy> so I need to come up with better parameterss on when to switch
2011-10-26T03:40:21  <bobbydroptable> f4hy maybe track how long it takes you to grab food between averges
2011-10-26T03:40:37  <Puj> bobbydroptable, I think you receive the food_spawn_rate as a startup param
2011-10-26T03:40:38  <bobbydroptable> if you know the food is coming in slowly, then kick in your defense
2011-10-26T03:40:45  <f4hy> Puj: I probably should just have something that checks for how much food I have gotten after the first 10 turns and retunes the thresholds
2011-10-26T03:40:50  <f4hy> burny: exactly
2011-10-26T03:40:53  <f4hy> bobbydroptable:
2011-10-26T03:40:59  <f4hy> burny: oopss ssorry
2011-10-26T03:41:18  <bobbydroptable> "loadtime"       # in milliseconds, time given for bot to start up after it is given "ready" (see below) "turntime"       # in milliseconds, time given to the bot each turn "rows"           # number of rows in the map "cols"           # number of columns in the map "turns"          # maximum number of turns in the game "viewradius2"    # view radius squared "attackradius2"  # battle radius squared "spawnradius2"   # food
2011-10-26T03:41:19  <Israfel> f4hy, phase 2 should occur when they reach a certain area of exploration. If there's no food, then defending and outer perimeter to control territory or location of enemy hills.
2011-10-26T03:41:29  <f4hy> My defense is stupid, but damn powerful so far.
2011-10-26T03:41:35  <bobbydroptable> nothing about food spawn rate here.
2011-10-26T03:41:40  <Puj> jk
2011-10-26T03:42:00  <janzert> bobbydroptable: your bot isn't told the rate

2011-10-26T04:37:29  <antimatroid> personally i like that much more
2011-10-26T04:37:34  <antimatroid> the other map just got a bit flooded
2011-10-26T04:37:57  <mehf> Please help :) should playgame.py be runned with some key to use presetted ants and food on map? i created map to test bot, set there food and ants, but map starts only whith ants on it
2011-10-26T04:38:16  <janzert> mehf: yes, I believe it is --scenario
2011-10-26T04:38:20  <mehf> *only whith hives on it

2011-10-26T04:46:04  <paulwal> janzert, are you an AI Challenge admin?
2011-10-26T04:46:45  <janzert> if it causes a visualizer problem that's certainly a bug, but I don't really know enough about the visualizer to help with that. McLeopold or mleise are the ones to talk to

2011-10-26T04:47:44  <paulwal> janzert, I just wrote a starter package.  Can we add it to the website?
2011-10-26T04:48:06  <janzert> do we support the language?
2011-10-26T04:48:36  <paulwal> The language is Tcl
2011-10-26T04:48:53  <paulwal> it should be installed on your server, though it may need an ugrade to 8.5
2011-10-26T04:49:20  <paulwal> upgrade*
2011-10-26T04:49:33  <janzert> we'll need to add support in the compiler infrastructure for it as well
2011-10-26T04:49:50  <janzert> it's not particularly hard just will need to be done
2011-10-26T04:50:07  <janzert> are you familiar with git and github?
2011-10-26T04:50:11  <paulwal> ok, how do we do that? I can help.  It's an interpreted, non-compiled language.
2011-10-26T04:50:24  <janzert> yep, somewhat familiar with Tcl

2011-10-26T04:51:56  <janzert> best way to procede would to fork the repo and add your starter then modify worker/compiler.py to add Tcl support

2011-10-26T04:52:45  <bobbydroptable> janzert - seeing as you guys support C#, does that mean F# is a possibility?
2011-10-26T04:52:56  <janzert> it would be really good if that package will work

2011-10-26T04:53:44  <paulwal> and the pull request is basically uploading tcl_starter_package.zip to ants/dist/starter_bots?

2011-10-26T05:29:35  <dmiles_afk> oh but it runs out of memory on the chomskyAIML set
2011-10-26T05:30:25  <dmiles_afk> but anyhow alicebots are not the di8rrection i intend to leave off on this bot.. but being able to handle sucha  aiml set is part of the baseline
2011-10-26T05:31:42  <dmiles_afk> the initial   in->out  idioms (that what aiml is) .. get converted to a special deep structure intermediate langauge
2011-10-26T05:31:58  <dmiles_afk> the aiml is a templete of "
2011-10-26T05:32:21  <dmiles_afk> [possible viabble and maybe even legal discourse examples"
2011-10-26T05:32:45  <dmiles_afk> the format actualyl store is the  deep

2011-10-26T05:33:50  <dmiles_afk> users anotate such transitions into a special ontology that has a set planner mode3l set of flows
2011-10-26T05:34:29  <dmiles_afk> then durrent runtime discourse such flows are attempted to be followed

2011-10-26T05:37:53  <paulwal> I didn't quite understand all of that, dmiles_afk.  But I'm curios, are you writing a prolog starter package for the AI Challenge?

2011-10-26T05:37:57  <paulwal> curious*

2011-10-26T05:38:40  <dmiles_afk> paulwal: i should be!
2011-10-26T05:39:10  <paulwal> that'd be cool! i just finished one in Tcl.
2011-10-26T05:40:16  <dmiles_afk> paulwal: the ants problem.. is the viusualizer a tcl app?
2011-10-26T05:41:10  <dmiles_afk> i asking becasue i am trying to decide if the prolog code needs glued to somethjing
2011-10-26T05:41:59  <paulwal> dmiles_afk, I believe the visualizer is in java. I wrote a new starter package for Tcl. It's not uploaded to the website yet.
2011-10-26T05:42:01  <paulwal> http://aichallenge.org/starter_packages.php
2011-10-26T05:42:08  <dmiles_afk> if the developer starting in prollog would be focusing not on the UI .. but more their brain code
2011-10-26T05:42:11  <paulwal> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Starter-Pack-Guide
2011-10-26T05:42:33  <bobbydroptable> you don't need to code the visualizer
2011-10-26T05:42:48  <bobbydroptable> the game engine takes your inputs and translate it into a map replay that the java visualizer plays
2011-10-26T05:43:06  <paulwal> You don't need to write a visualizer.  Your prolog bot will be executed by a python script, which can optionally send your bot's output to the java visualizer

2011-10-26T05:49:55  <Garf> dmiles_afk: there are TCP servers available for testing that work over the same text protocol
2011-10-26T05:50:21  <olexs> how is the landing page game chosen?
2011-10-26T05:50:31  <paulwal> The official AI Challenge server runs your bot locally on their server, and communication is via stdout and stdin
2011-10-26T05:50:33  <dmiles_afk> ok then in that case it might make sense for the prolog code to concentrate on connecting to that realtime server?
2011-10-26T05:50:57  <bobbydroptable> no
2011-10-26T05:51:03  <bobbydroptable> no need to connect to server
2011-10-26T05:51:03  <dmiles_afk> ok good.. that case is stdin/out but it would be channeled to a tcp se4rver

2011-10-26T06:37:42  <delt0r_> That is why A* is nice, by changing the Heuristic you can get quite different behaviors including plain old Djikstra

2011-10-26T06:37:58  <olexs> Six: depends on the application. in many cases, yes
2011-10-26T06:39:19  <olexs> bobbydroptable: if you want more technical tips about battles, what I use is a alpha-beta search over a game tree for every local conflict
2011-10-26T06:39:36  <delt0r_> olexs: A* can be a DFS too with a non admissible H
2011-10-26T06:39:48  <delt0r_> or whatever the proper terminology is

2011-10-26T06:40:43  <bobbydroptable> haha i'm afriad i haven't progressed that far yet
2011-10-26T06:41:03  <bobbydroptable> i have just learnt of a particular data structure which would hopefully solve the problem I was trying to solve

2011-10-26T06:43:53  <bobbydroptable> my first bot worked fine, if there was a hill near an ant, it would attack. if there was food near an ant it would pick it up
2011-10-26T06:44:11  <bobbydroptable> but if there weren't anything of the sort, then it would walk in a fashion i could not control

2011-10-26T06:46:43  <bobbydroptable> do you just point it at a particular direction or do you plan a path there
2011-10-26T06:47:12  <halligalli> olexs but if that location is far away and there is an invisible area at the time - how do you handle that? Do you save map information over time?

2011-10-26T06:49:11  <olexs> and yes, I save map information over time, I always know what my ants already have seen and what they can see right now
2011-10-26T06:49:24  <bobbydroptable> okay, scenario: 2 ants are at a T intersection
2011-10-26T06:49:38  <bobbydroptable> both does the BFS
2011-10-26T06:49:47  <halligalli> olexs i am wondering if it makes sense to save paths over time to be able to have them instantly instead of computing them via A* or alike
2011-10-26T06:50:13  <bobbydroptable> does your ants both go in the same direction, or do they go in different directions, or do you have no control over which direction they decide on
2011-10-26T06:50:16  <olexs> halligalli: I don't do that, but it certainly can make sense in some situations
2011-10-26T06:50:46  <bobbydroptable> halligalli: it is horribly difficult ==" i tried doing it for the past 3 days, and I've switched strategies now.
2011-10-26T06:51:04  <halligalli> bobbydroptable you mean it is difficult to save paths?
2011-10-26T06:51:11  *** Blkt <Blkt!~user@89-96-199-46.ip13.fastwebnet.it> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-26T06:51:21  <bobbydroptable> its difficult to save paths to be used in future searches.
2011-10-26T06:51:40  <bobbydroptable> if you just want to safe a path from a single search ,that's not too bad
2011-10-26T06:51:42  <halligalli> bobbydroptable it is memory intensive but why should it be difficult?
2011-10-26T06:52:06  <olexs> bobbydroptable: in a rare case the ants are equally distant from both sides, they might go in the same direction. but since one ant will almost always be behind the other or near it, they will ultimately choose different paths, since the first ant will pick a direction and go, when the next ant arrives at the intersection the other unexplored side will be 1 pixel closer to him
2011-10-26T06:52:07  <bobbydroptable> well i'm not particularly skilled in this area, so if there was an easy way, i'm all ears
2011-10-26T06:52:23  <paulwal> olexs, do you wipe clean the location of hills, food, and ants before the start of a turn, or do you remember their last known locations?
2011-10-26T06:53:17  <halligalli> bobbydroptable neither am i ;) maybe i'll try it and run into the same difficulties ;)
2011-10-26T06:53:29  <olexs> paulwal: I wipe everything, it makes it easier right now. I will probably modify the bot later to remember food and hills locations outside of visible area, since there are some problems with that now
2011-10-26T06:54:11  <halligalli> can anyone point me in a direction of what kind of algorithms might be helpful for fighting?
2011-10-26T06:54:22  <halligalli> some clustering kinds?
2011-10-26T06:54:48  <paulwal> what problems, olexs? is it too cpu intensive to figure out which tiles are no longer visible?
2011-10-26T06:54:52  <olexs> halligalli: clustering is a good start. again, for me it's BFS with a limited radius, repeated multiple times
2011-10-26T06:55:31  <halligalli> olexs you mean bfs from ants to find other ants and move in that direction?
2011-10-26T06:55:46  <bobbydroptable> halligalli: maybe we are talking abotu separate problems or maybe i am just thinking too much over a non-problem
2011-10-26T06:56:17  <olexs> paulwal: no, nothing like that. but there is a rare condition where my ant will see a food in another corridor in a maze that he cannot reach yet; he will start going there, but as soon as he loses that food item from sight, he might turn around and go see it again, and again, and again :)
2011-10-26T06:56:44  <olexs> halligalli: bfs from ants to find other ants, to build groups of them, no moving involved on this step yet
2011-10-26T06:57:19  <olexs> after I build clusters, the complex part comes into play, with the state-space search in a game tree :)
2011-10-26T06:57:23  <halligalli> olexs ah, okay, so finding possible fighting gangs and then afterwards applying algorithms to move them in a fight-appropriate manner
2011-10-26T06:57:28  <olexs> exactly
2011-10-26T06:57:44  <halligalli> olexs phew, game tree, fancy
2011-10-26T06:57:57  <halligalli> olexs probably time-limits is the biggest problem
2011-10-26T06:58:08  <Six> olexs: might be an idea to give them a 'goto' goal
2011-10-26T06:58:08  <olexs> yep... this is the most time-consuming part
2011-10-26T06:59:03  <halligalli> olexs so something like min-max adversary i guess?
2011-10-26T06:59:24  <olexs> halligalli: yes. alpha-beta is an optimization of a min-max search, that's what I do
2011-10-26T06:59:33  <halligalli> cool
2011-10-26T06:59:40  <halligalli> i still have a lot of stuff to do ;)
2011-10-26T07:00:03  <halligalli> currently i have a global heat map and each ant is doing bfs to find the hotspot around
2011-10-26T07:00:14  <olexs> it seems I'm giving away all my secrets here :)
2011-10-26T07:00:37  <Six> heatmap is a nice idea
2011-10-26T07:00:50  <halligalli> hehe, don't worry, i think the implementation is the hardest part in terms of efficiency in time
2011-10-26T07:00:52  <Six> could have pretty simple ant logic with a good heatmap
2011-10-26T07:00:56  <olexs> still enough technicalities behind everything that actually make it work...
2011-10-26T07:01:11  <halligalli> yeah, my heatmap is pretty simple, yet it performs decent
2011-10-26T07:01:53  <halligalli> but i guess at least the fights have to be treated separately
2011-10-26T07:03:26  <Six> yeah
2011-10-26T07:03:47  <halligalli> has anyone tried to try to optimize the whole game state, i.e. have a heuristic judging the whole game state and then minimizing it by moving the ants?
2011-10-26T07:03:58  <Six> heatmap sounds good for overall goal planning, but local vision is better for particular goals
2011-10-26T07:04:56  <halligalli> this challenge is awesome, one can try so many concepts
2011-10-26T07:05:06  <Six> halligalli: that sounds tough to do with unknown similtanious moves
2011-10-26T07:05:58  <Six> like, enemy ants can move in a number of different ways
2011-10-26T07:06:01  <halligalli> Six well it would be a state search over all your ants making all possible moves, try to minimize that - i assume it will time out if you do not have good heuristics
2011-10-26T07:06:26  <halligalli> for starters you could ignore the enemy moves
2011-10-26T07:06:54  <olexs> halligalli: I think I can tell you right now that will time out instantly :) I only consider moves in local clusters, and only a limited number of group moves, not all possible moves by all ants, and it is still very time-consuming

2011-10-26T07:08:20  <olexs> if you try to search all ant moves, it would be a 4^ants branching factor, much higher then even chess, and in chess they use move generators with optimizations :)
2011-10-26T07:08:25  <halligalli> olexs but again maybe not finding the optimal, but using a heuristic guiding the choices, i.e. decide on a random move per ant and then randomly change moves of ants, kind of a random walk like manner

2011-10-26T07:11:02  <olexs> in fact I got the idea from chess AIs, and still think of some optimizations they use, like quiescence search
2011-10-26T07:11:36  <antimatroid> olexs: how many ants are you allowing in each partition?
2011-10-26T07:12:31  <olexs> antimatroid: there are no limits set per se. it wil cluster all ants roughly "in one fight together", the bfs search radius is double attack radius iirc, with iterative extension for every found ant
2011-10-26T07:12:33  <jix_> I think if you want to use strategies from abstract logic game AIs (like chess etc) go would be the game to look at... it also has the problem of a very very high branching factor
2011-10-26T07:13:10  <antimatroid> game trees are always what one wants, it's just a matter of where you're going to prune things
2011-10-26T07:13:27  <antimatroid> or if that's just never going to happen heuristics <3
2011-10-26T07:13:56  <olexs> simple pruning a-la alpha-beta works rather well
2011-10-26T07:14:34  <antimatroid> i don't trust alpha beta pruning when generating a tree
2011-10-26T07:14:41  <olexs> why not?
2011-10-26T07:14:42  <antimatroid> but i guess one has to throw stuff out somewhere
2011-10-26T07:14:48  <antimatroid> because it isn't optimal
2011-10-26T07:14:54  <jix_> alpha beta pruning is
2011-10-26T07:15:12  <antimatroid> it's alright when evaluating a tree, but if you use alpha beta to prune stuff while generating the tree you may miss optimal strategies
2011-10-26T07:15:29  <Garf> no, thats simply not true
2011-10-26T07:15:30  <bobbydroptable> olexs: if they altered the attackradius/viewradius would you need to redo your gametrees?
2011-10-26T07:15:44  <antimatroid> yes it is
2011-10-26T07:15:50  <Garf> alpha-beta pruning is safe, equivalent to minimax
2011-10-26T07:16:01  <antimatroid> ergh, you're not reading me
2011-10-26T07:16:03  <olexs> bobbydroptable: no, all the parameters are dynamic
2011-10-26T07:16:23  <antimatroid> it's alright when evaluating a tree you have, but not when you're still going to generate more tree
2011-10-26T07:16:24  <bobbydroptable> oh so its not loading from a file, its generating it on the fly?
2011-10-26T07:16:53  <olexs> bobbydroptable: nothing's loading from a file :) the trees are generated for every battle on the fly, yes
2011-10-26T07:17:20  <bobbydroptable> sounds computationally expensive
2011-10-26T07:17:35  <olexs> it is, but it fits in the time frame
2011-10-26T07:17:38  <bobbydroptable> i'd rather a "numerical superiority" heuristic lol
2011-10-26T07:17:55  <antimatroid> and in java too :|
2011-10-26T07:18:18  <bobbydroptable> yeh the number of java in the top 10 is really really surprising
2011-10-26T07:18:18  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-26T07:18:23  <bobbydroptable> i tried doing java for planetwars
2011-10-26T07:18:27  <bobbydroptable> timedout all the time
2011-10-26T07:18:32  <bobbydroptable> then again, i suck so it's probably just me
2011-10-26T07:18:47  <bobbydroptable> but hey, python is on top now, so that gives me hoep
2011-10-26T07:19:28  <olexs> I don't know what everybody has got against java :) it's as fast as you program it to be... as long as you know to use the correct data structures and not overload the GC, you're just fine with java
2011-10-26T07:19:43  <bobbydroptable> well yeh, thus i put that disclaimer there :D
2011-10-26T07:20:04  <antimatroid> i don't even really know it
2011-10-26T07:20:25  <antimatroid> used it in first year programming classes as a first language, used c in second year then didn't look back once i met c++

2011-10-26T08:20:04  <master_ninja> my bot only knows how to get food and sometimes even tries to raze hills
2011-10-26T08:20:41  <GeorgeJ> what pathfinding algorithms do you folks use?
2011-10-26T08:20:54  <UncleVasya> There is near 2 mons more, you have a time to teach it do other things.
2011-10-26T08:21:06  <bobbydroptable> tiered a* is my plan
2011-10-26T08:21:13  <UncleVasya> Generally it's BFS or A*.
2011-10-26T08:21:39  <master_ninja> my but just tries to follow walls, and when it sees it food or hill it uses BFS
2011-10-26T08:22:21  <master_ninja> at least it doesn't time out anymore
2011-10-26T08:26:41  <mayanks43> A* always better than BFS right?
2011-10-26T08:27:01  <bobbydroptable> someone was here earlier saying he didn't need to do A* at all
2011-10-26T08:27:08  <bobbydroptable> and he's 4th on the table
2011-10-26T08:27:10  <bobbydroptable> so i can't say
2011-10-26T08:27:23  <mayanks43> hmmm
2011-10-26T08:27:41  <paulwal> olexs said that
2011-10-26T08:28:05  <olexs> A* is better if you need long paths around obstacles
2011-10-26T08:28:41  <olexs> since most searches I do are rather small (within view radius or less), BFS suffices, and it is less complex implementation-wise
2011-10-26T08:29:30  <UncleVasya> A* is faster and as optimal as BFS  in the case you've done the hieristic function right. If There is a mistake than A*'s path will be longer than the one found by BFS.
2011-10-26T08:29:55  <UncleVasya> I think in Ants you can have 2 reasons to choose A*:
2011-10-26T08:29:58  <olexs> I will use A* in some cases later, for now I can't get it to be as fast in reality as my BFS is because of data structure overhead needed
2011-10-26T08:30:12  <UncleVasya> 1. You want to try it.
2011-10-26T08:30:17  <GeorgeJ> Do you guys cache ?
2011-10-26T08:30:51  <mayanks43> why shouldn't you if you can?
2011-10-26T08:31:50  <UncleVasya> 2. You know well what you do and you really need these few miliseconds (wich is the difference between A* and BFS).

2011-10-26T08:33:19  <UncleVasya> 2nd means you can optimize well on your language of choise and will use smart enought even few released miliseconds.
2011-10-26T08:33:56  <UncleVasya> If you care only about implementing your ideas to make it just work, than BFS is enough I believe.
2011-10-26T08:34:10  <mayanks43> good then I'll go for BFS for now
2011-10-26T08:35:37  <GeorgeJ> just make a get_path_toN function, and implement BFS at first if you find it easier, then a* as get_path_to2 or something, you should be able to use them interchangeably

2011-10-26T09:26:59  <GeorgeJ> Make a "scout" army,  divide map space to squares small enough for vision of an ant, and send each ant in a square
2011-10-26T09:27:35  <mayanks43> yeah really nice strategy :D
2011-10-26T09:27:47  <bobbydroptable> i wish the squares things worked

2011-10-26T09:28:05  <GeorgeJ> bobbydroptable: Why wouldn't it?
2011-10-26T09:28:05  <bobbydroptable> i kept having problem separating my map
2011-10-26T09:28:11  <bobbydroptable> because of the water tiles causing problems
2011-10-26T09:28:15  <mayanks43> feels like playing an rts
2011-10-26T09:28:18  <avdg2> meh, the squares fits in my strategy thoug
2011-10-26T09:28:20  <GeorgeJ> :D
2011-10-26T09:28:20  <avdg2> h
2011-10-26T09:28:35  <bobbydroptable> so i am in a square, then food appears across a river, then my ant can't get there
2011-10-26T09:28:50  <bobbydroptable> because the square is split by the river
2011-10-26T09:28:56  <GeorgeJ> bobbydroptable: ant_closest_to(row, col)
2011-10-26T09:29:07  <avdg2> bobbydroptable: thats the trick ;-)
2011-10-26T09:29:07  <Six> you need to do it more like space filling as you go
2011-10-26T09:29:23  <bobbydroptable> GeorgeJ we are talking about separating the grid and having an ant in each square right?
2011-10-26T09:29:39  <GeorgeJ> bobbydroptable: For vision, yes, not neccesarely for gathering
2011-10-26T09:29:49  <bobbydroptable> ah
2011-10-26T09:29:52  <bobbydroptable> fair enough then

2011-10-26T09:41:27  <avdg2> geekchimp: you could output debug data in stderr
2011-10-26T09:42:55  <randll> i know nothing about python, but in java i user remote debugging
2011-10-26T09:43:19  <randll> i think this is also possible for python
2011-10-26T09:43:51  <GeorgeJ> Or have a seppare file named yourbot_pid.log
2011-10-26T09:44:02  <GeorgeJ> And dump log data there, if you don't want to use stderr
2011-10-26T09:44:50  <avdg2> meh, I believe stderr is the best way to do it
2011-10-26T09:45:08  <avdg2> you can specify the log options by hand (see "./playgame.py" help screen)
2011-10-26T09:45:49  <avdg2> if you have to write files, you have to modify it as well before submitting it to the server
2011-10-26T09:45:56  <avdg2> (which doesn't allow writes)

2011-10-26T09:48:26  <GeorgeJ> avdg2: Or you could juse use a debug switch
2011-10-26T09:48:37  <avdg2> yeah
2011-10-26T09:48:45  <GeorgeJ> Either at compile time or runtime

2011-10-26T10:57:01  <avdg2> yeah
2011-10-26T10:57:05  * avdg2 is doing js
2011-10-26T10:57:06  <fercho> in the list it says that the hills are not implemented

2011-10-26T10:57:32  <fercho> does that means that when fetching the enemyHills() object, i don't get any results?
2011-10-26T10:57:52  <avdg2> fercho: if you want to do some js programming with that package, its better to begin with the game specifications ;-)
2011-10-26T10:57:58  <avdg2> http://aichallenge.org/specification.php
2011-10-26T10:58:10  <avdg2> so you know the protocol and also what the code is trying to do
2011-10-26T10:58:24  <avdg2> because that js package isn't the best one to start with
2011-10-26T10:58:48  <avdg2> but that doesn't mean that js is a bad language ;-)

2011-10-26T11:00:16  <fercho> I'll take a look at the game specifications first
2011-10-26T11:00:28  <avdg2> fercho: the best way to learn the spec and write your own engine, thats how I've done it

2011-10-26T11:27:29  <Garf> can a dead ant be at the same place as a live ant in the input?
2011-10-26T11:27:30  <fercho> thanks!
2011-10-26T11:27:50  <Garf> i.e. an ant dies the turn before someone moves into its square
2011-10-26T11:28:04  <avdg2> garf: in theory yes, but I have to check the order of the engine first
2011-10-26T11:28:08  <avdg2> let me check
2011-10-26T11:28:26  <bobbydroptable> doesn't seem possible though
2011-10-26T11:28:31  <bobbydroptable> with attack range 2
2011-10-26T11:28:40  <avdg2> no, it seems its not possible
2011-10-26T11:28:41  <bobbydroptable> there's no way it would get in range before dying
2011-10-26T11:28:43  <avdg2> first step is move
2011-10-26T11:28:52  <avdg2> I think

2011-10-26T11:29:01  <Garf> so hills is the only thing that can overlap with anything else
2011-10-26T11:29:09  <avdg2> at least if I can believe http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#Turns-and-Phases
2011-10-26T11:29:25  <bobbydroptable> well at the current attack radius of 2.??
2011-10-26T11:29:39  <bobbydroptable> that means the safest distance would be A..B
2011-10-26T11:29:40  <mleise> two dead ants of the same team can overlap
2011-10-26T11:29:54  <avdg2> oh yeah of course :-)
2011-10-26T11:30:12  <aavikkojootti> hello? am i in ignore?
2011-10-26T11:30:13  <avdg2> overlooked that
2011-10-26T11:30:24  <Garf> how long do dead ants last?
2011-10-26T11:30:25  <avdg2> aavikkojootti: sorry?
2011-10-26T11:30:33  <bobbydroptable> yes but if an ant is dead on a tile there can't be a live one there?

2011-10-26T11:31:37  <Garf> then how can 2 dead ants be on the same square?
2011-10-26T11:31:46  <avdg2> suicide
2011-10-26T11:31:57  <Garf> ah, a collision
2011-10-26T11:32:01  <Garf> ok, I wont worry about that
2011-10-26T11:32:13  <bobbydroptable> yeh cuz it should never happen :)

2011-10-26T11:33:02  <avdg2> (and a good bot, but that doesn't account 2 dead bots on the same location, so it crashes :o-

2011-10-26T11:33:43  <avdg2> I wonder if this really happens though
2011-10-26T11:33:53  <bobbydroptable> i don't think you see enemy dead ants.
2011-10-26T11:33:54  <bobbydroptable> ?

2011-10-26T11:55:03  <avdg2> there is always the risk of getting spawned food
2011-10-26T11:55:07  <ikaros> anyone knows if the server sends my own hills every round or only if they are in sight?
2011-10-26T11:55:33  <cobracom> and there's a problem that a food can be destroyed ...
2011-10-26T11:55:53  <avdg2> well, thats if the food is outside sight or you don't care about enemies
2011-10-26T11:56:16  <cobracom> no, I mean that both me and my enemy are both eligible to eat the food
2011-10-26T11:56:25  <cobracom> and thus it is destroyed

2011-10-26T14:49:57  <Fluxid> cool, thanks. i'll look into it
2011-10-26T14:50:35  <Fluxid> i guess the top bots implemented it, they behave in similar way when around an enemy
2011-10-26T14:50:44  <craklyn> You predict the way the board might look in the future and you calculate the "value" of those future boards based on some rule you make, or heuristic.  You then choose the board which is optimal for you.
2011-10-26T14:51:26  <craklyn> Hopefully what I said makes sense.  I can try to rephrase it if you need.

2011-10-26T15:03:47  <SharkMonkey> Are the radii rounded down or up?
2011-10-26T15:04:10  <burny> they aren't rounded
2011-10-26T15:04:18  <Zannick> don't use sqrt
2011-10-26T15:04:22  <janzert> I think our registration letter got hung up in an anti-spam system and this is instructions for it to be delivered :/ http://pastebin.com/kd1sueGm
2011-10-26T15:04:46  <SharkMonkey> So effectively up then then?
2011-10-26T15:05:04  <amstan> janzert: well, i think we can ignore it
2011-10-26T15:05:20  <GeorgeJ> Zannick: What then?
2011-10-26T15:05:44  <Zannick> if x and y are the axis distances in question
2011-10-26T15:05:45  <amstan> unless we feel really nice and find someone that speaks russian to confirm on what exactly we have to do
2011-10-26T15:06:14  <Zannick> instead of comparing sqrt(x^2 + y^2) to sqrt(r^2), just compare (x^2+y^2) to r^2
2011-10-26T15:06:17  <janzert> well I think mail.ru might be fairly large russian email host so if we just need to reply with a letter and then we'll be good to get past their spam system it would be nice
2011-10-26T15:06:29  <Zannick> remember, the radius values you are given are r^2, not r.
2011-10-26T15:06:54  <janzert> I'll try and catch UncleVasya later
2011-10-26T15:07:03  <amstan> janzert: such antispam features can't expect all automated emails to conform to their instructions

2011-10-26T15:10:56  <contestbot> amstan: I think that worked...
2011-10-26T15:12:18  <janzert> @later tell McLeopold the thing I saw in macosx zips that would likely still be causing compilation failures is the inclusion of __SourceFile.java files (source files with __ prefixed) that looked to be coming from an IDE or editor as backup files. I don't think we should do anything to try and automatically handle these though since it seems too likely to also catch a legitimate file (e.g. __init__.py)

2011-10-26T15:19:43  <yohann> i use the python starter pack, and followed all the strategy tutorial, and uploaded my code, my bot is doing a lot of timeout, is is normal ?
2011-10-26T15:20:05  <Fluxid> yohann: no, it is bad
2011-10-26T15:20:09  <yohann> there is no A* nor anything time consuming yet
2011-10-26T15:20:16  <thestinger> the way the python tutorial gets you to deal with unseen locations is pretty bad
2011-10-26T15:20:22  <Fluxid> yohann: maybe you have a bug
2011-10-26T15:21:19  <yohann> fluxid, i juste fallowed strategy guide step by step and get the same result as in the example.map
2011-10-26T15:21:24  <thestinger> it calculates the distance from each ant to each unseen location (most of the map at the start), keeps it all in a list, then sorts it

2011-10-26T15:22:47  <thestinger> I thought it was my graph searches doing it, but it was the code for sending ants to unseen squares
2011-10-26T15:23:22  <yohann> thank you, i think i need to fix that before going into more interesting things then.

2011-10-26T15:24:38  <yohann> i think i'll start by  calculate the nearest unseen square from each unordered ants

2011-10-26T16:35:34  <_ulises> are there any admins of the website about? I'm having issues loging in (even though I have my password saved in my browser, etc.)
2011-10-26T16:35:51  <dinosoep> I'm having problems with my bot
2011-10-26T16:36:32  <dinosoep> I think the mistake  is in the starter package and not my bot cause I've been looking a damn long time and can't spot the mistake
2011-10-26T16:37:00  <burny> have you tried submittig the starter as-is?
2011-10-26T16:37:16  <dinosoep> no
2011-10-26T16:37:24  <dinosoep> but everything was working great

2011-10-26T16:37:38  <dinosoep> and it seems after a lot of commands it suddenly crashes
2011-10-26T16:38:35  <dinosoep> I'll show the part containing the problem, if that doesn't contain the problem then it must be in the starter
2011-10-26T16:40:53  <analyst74> have you tried to duplicate the problem and manually walk-through the failure?
2011-10-26T16:42:22  <dinosoep> I'm not able to duplicate the problem, I'll try to make a very short example
2011-10-26T16:42:37  <dinosoep> here is the code that when commented out doesn't make my bot crash:http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15024434/errors.d
2011-10-26T16:42:55  <dinosoep> but there is no obvious thing wrong with it
2011-10-26T16:43:05  <dinosoep> and it only crashes around 30 turns
2011-10-26T16:43:06  <analyst74> pastebin is probably easier for posting code
2011-10-26T16:43:27  <Garf> you're timing out perhaps?
2011-10-26T16:43:38  <Garf> thats the code in the examples that gets very slow on large maps/ants

2011-10-26T16:52:36  <avdg2> lol, my bot is crashing too much atm
2011-10-26T16:53:11  <dinosoep> and the annoying thing is that it gives you no information whatsoever as to how it crashed :s
2011-10-26T16:53:22  <analyst74> You probably know way more than I do about D (which is nothing) :p
2011-10-26T16:53:33  <avdg2> its a language
2011-10-26T16:53:47  <analyst74> arh, now I know something about D!
2011-10-26T16:54:01  <analyst74> but I assume it would have some sort of debugging/logging technique
2011-10-26T16:54:09  <dinosoep> yes, it has
2011-10-26T16:54:12  <analyst74> that you can use to do tracing
2011-10-26T16:54:22  <dinosoep> but I never get an exception

2011-10-26T16:58:53  <dwins> dinosoep: when running locally i have a little script like: tee bot.in.log | dwinsbot | tee bot.out.log instead of just my bot
2011-10-26T16:58:59  <GeorgeJ> Where is stderr redirected to when running test_bot.bat?
2011-10-26T16:59:06  <dwins> so i can review stdin and stdout afterward
2011-10-26T16:59:16  <avdg2> yeah and stderr
2011-10-26T16:59:30  <avdg2> (which is useful for debug messages)
2011-10-26T16:59:53  <analyst74> there is an option in playgame.py that allows output error message, otherwise all errors will be swollen
2011-10-26T17:00:09  <dinosoep> yeah? how do you make it spit out errors?
2011-10-26T17:00:15  <avdg2> use -E

2011-10-26T17:14:55  <craklyn> If you see the enemy willingly trade an ant for no gain, you could track that.  But there may be a bot which is super smart and sacrifices for the long-term advantage (grabbing a defensible nook in the terrain, getting two ants the next turn, getting a food so no actual net loss, etc)

2011-10-26T17:34:50  <jix_> dwins: hmm I do pass that one locally though..
2011-10-26T17:35:04  <Zannick> if you're going to paste more than 5 lines at a time could you use pastebin?
2011-10-26T17:35:05  <t_> and I can't find the solution... :S
2011-10-26T17:35:13  <dwins> jix_: so does my built-from-scratch scala bot
2011-10-26T17:35:18  <t_> woops sorry :s
2011-10-26T17:35:34  <Zannick> also have you tried running it with python 2.7?
2011-10-26T17:35:37  <t_> I will think to pastebin for the next time
2011-10-26T17:35:45  <Zannick> i think the tools are python2, not 3 :/
2011-10-26T17:35:56  <jix_> dwins: and yours does work on the server too?
2011-10-26T17:36:01  <dwins> yep
2011-10-26T17:36:17  <Zannick> actually, i'm not sure whether that explains it
2011-10-26T17:36:29  <t_> so why is there a python 3.2 section for the tools ?
2011-10-26T17:36:37  <dwins> Zannick: the server expects a MyBot.scala file and a MyBot object with a main method, that tripped me up a bit
2011-10-26T17:36:51  <dwins> but once i got things compiling and named right it ran ok
2011-10-26T17:37:08  <Zannick> hm. maybe this? http://bugs.python.org/issue4996
2011-10-26T17:37:10  <dwins> oops, jix_ ^^
2011-10-26T17:37:38  <analyst74> t_, there is python 3.2 section for the tools?
2011-10-26T17:38:02  <Zannick> well, that's an old bug
2011-10-26T17:38:17  <Zannick> but ought to be fixed in 3.2?
2011-10-26T17:38:22  <jix_> dwins: hmm there seem to be more online tests... for my first upload I got a 64bit seed an it failed as I parsed it as an Int.. so my code does run... and the local script doesn't pass such a seed
2011-10-26T17:38:40  <dwins> interesting
2011-10-26T17:38:51  <Zannick> jix_: oops!
2011-10-26T17:39:07  <dwins> jix_: well the specification does say that it's a 64-bit int for the seed. other numeric values are all 32-bit ints though
2011-10-26T17:39:20  * dwins suddenly worries about signs
2011-10-26T17:39:32  <jix_> yeah I know so I fixed it and now I get a timeout in turn 0 that I can't reproduce
2011-10-26T17:39:54  <jix_> dwins: the seed that I got was negative, so just using toLong should work
2011-10-26T17:41:15  <t_> Zannick, more, if y avec this error, the script terminate with no more problem, and launch a web application that is frozen (i can click "play", nothing move) ...
2011-10-26T17:41:21  <t_> I'm cursed.
2011-10-26T17:41:50  <t_> ho ! I forgot : I'm use windows XP ...

2011-10-26T17:42:28  <Zannick> no, the problem is within your python3.2 lib
2011-10-26T17:42:34  <t_> analyst74: there is a python 3.2 version for the starter pack, at least
2011-10-26T17:43:17  <analyst74> that starter bot is for 3.2, but the bot engine is supposed to run with 2.x I suppose
2011-10-26T17:43:28  <mayanks43> yup
2011-10-26T17:43:38  <Zannick> t_: the python3 bot does not include python3 tools. the tools are python2 only
2011-10-26T17:44:26  <mayanks43> earlier my default python was python3
2011-10-26T17:44:33  <mayanks43> had point it to python2
2011-10-26T17:44:34  <t_> I don't get the point : must I have the two versions of python to launch the bot ??
2011-10-26T17:44:40  <mayanks43> for the tools to run
2011-10-26T17:44:46  <mbaricevic> I wasn't able to find this anywhere on the main site (e.g. in the problem description, etc) but after a search on the Forums it looks like the time limit for a turn is 1 second? I'm just poking my head in to verify this.
2011-10-26T17:45:08  <Zannick> mbaricevic: it's specified in the initial bot input

2011-10-26T18:08:56  <jix_> hmm can anyone point me at what exactly is tested on submission?
2011-10-26T18:09:19  <janzert> jix_: look at the test_bot script
2011-10-26T18:09:32  <burny> janz, that's what I think also
2011-10-26T18:10:21  <jix_> janzert: but on submission I got passed a large negative seed which made my bot fail... the test_bot script doesn't do that... now I fixed that and it still fails on the server... while it does pass the test_bot script locally
2011-10-26T18:11:07  <janzert> sounds like you're running locally on a 32bit system while the server is 64bit so I'd look for other differences related to that
2011-10-26T18:12:28  <jix_> janzert: no I am running 64bit... and I'm using scala which is the same on both... but as I said I fixed that part... it fails on a later test now and I can't reproduce that

2011-10-26T18:18:51  <janzert> actually I think the first bit and last bit
2011-10-26T18:19:08  <cyphase> what does first and last bit mean?
2011-10-26T18:19:33  <janzert> first x bytes and last x bytes where x is I believe around 500

2011-10-26T18:49:11  <jtza8> Interesting, on OS X, when running tools/play_one_game.sh from my source dirrectory, "." refers to the source dir in the bash file.
2011-10-26T18:49:27  <jtza8> Obviously it doesn't in the tutorial.
2011-10-26T18:49:48  <magiik> . is always the working directory i thought? e.g. when executing a bash script, the directory from where the script was called
2011-10-26T18:50:03  <magiik> not the directory of the script?
2011-10-26T18:50:22  <magiik> in windows batch scripting i think it is the same, you use %~dp0 for the file location directory
2011-10-26T18:51:22  <jtza8> Strange that it works in the tutorial.

2011-10-26T19:12:30  <jix_> amstan: yeah it runs games fine here
2011-10-26T19:12:30  <mcstar> the interesting thin is, there arent many people with problems
2011-10-26T19:12:31  <_ulises> jix_: the server usually gives you logs as to why tests failed I believe
2011-10-26T19:12:44  <jix_> _ulises: yeah I get some debug output and then a timeout
2011-10-26T19:12:48  <amstan> jix_: same os, same cpu?
2011-10-26T19:12:49  <mcstar> there are over 4000 users, and the stream of problems is like the very end of beta
2011-10-26T19:13:04  <_ulises> jix_: care to paste them on pastebin?
2011-10-26T19:13:23  <jix_> amstan: I'm using scala so it shouldn't be too os/cpu sensitive but I'm running arch linux 64bit with scala 2.9.1 here
2011-10-26T19:13:34  <jix_> _ulises: the output? it's only my own debug output
2011-10-26T19:13:34  <mcstar> arch ftw
2011-10-26T19:14:00  <_ulises> jix_: oh, you mean your local tests give you timeouts? or is it when you submit your code to the server?
2011-10-26T19:14:17  <jix_> _ulises: on the server
2011-10-26T19:14:17  <amstan> jix_: ok, seems fine then
2011-10-26T19:14:29  <amstan> jix_: define test though
2011-10-26T19:14:44  <amstan> jix_: there's test_bot.sh or something that runs the exact test that the server runs
2011-10-26T19:14:51  <jix_> amstan: locally I can run games with the live visualizer and I can run test_bot.sh

2011-10-26T19:15:40  <cyphase> burny, some need a computer to be practical, some can be done by hand but are easier with a computer, and some are relatively easy by hand (if you know the math)

2011-10-26T19:16:11  <cyphase> burny, of course some problems can only be done naively with a computer but are very quick if you know the proper formula
2011-10-26T19:16:35  <jix_> I output line <first_word_of_line_read> for each settings line... followed by a line for when I got ready. line player_seed is the last output I get
2011-10-26T19:16:37  <burny> k, wasn't sure if maybe they were intended as pure maths
2011-10-26T19:16:45  <amstan> jix_: i remember there being a problem with the player_seed, the specs say that all numbers are 32 bit, but the seed was 64bit for some reason
2011-10-26T19:17:15  <jix_> amstan: the specs do say it's 64bit... and that was why my first upload failed... I fixed that though... it even fails when I don't parse the line at all
2011-10-26T19:17:25  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-10-26T19:17:49  <cyphase> burny, no, there's definitely a programming bias, but its not 100%. also, here's an example of a problem that naively is hard by hand and easy with a computer, but that can be done much faster and for much larger numbers if you know the proper formula: http://projecteuler.net/problem=1
2011-10-26T19:17:51  <jix_> amstan: also the server tests with a number that doesn't fit into 32bit... the script bundled with the tools doesn't... so it's not doing the exact same thing

2011-10-26T19:28:25  <Sakura_> Having some questioning here.
2011-10-26T19:28:32  <Minthos> poorly - my bot is awesome but the server fails to run it
2011-10-26T19:28:40  <cyphase> jix_, 'go' tells the engine you're ready for your turn to begin. if you send it early, you could be doing setup during your valuable turn time
2011-10-26T19:28:43  <jix_> I'm really out of ideas... it works locally with the exact same input....
2011-10-26T19:29:09  <jix_> cyphase: I'm not sending it early... but I get a timeout before I get a ready (at least it seems so to my bot) on the server

2011-10-26T19:29:38  <Sakura_> Minthos- that sucks. can't you optimize further? It's about timeout/crashes?
2011-10-26T19:30:13  <Minthos> it's about crashing, I'm trying to debug it
2011-10-26T19:30:51  <jix_> I'm pretty sure it must be something in the scala lib that changed between 2.9.0.1 and 2.9.1... so I'm probably using something in a way it wasn't intended to be used... as they are supposed to be compatible
2011-10-26T19:31:14  <Sakura_> Minthos: Pretty hard to debug crashes in that kind of remote setting.
2011-10-26T19:31:15  <Zannick> jix_: so what might be happening is that you stop reading from input
2011-10-26T19:31:22  <jix_> and it must be something with the way I'm reading stuff...
2011-10-26T19:31:36  <jix_> maybe I should use the plain java stuff instead of the nicer iterator based stuff
2011-10-26T19:32:01  <Zannick> and so you don't get the 'ready' and the engine thinks you've timed out
2011-10-26T19:32:32  <Sakura_> So... nobody can tell me why || how the DeadTiles are relevant to anything?
2011-10-26T19:32:32  <_ulises> jix_: perhaps the input is being buffered behind the scenes?
2011-10-26T19:32:55  <Minthos> Sakura_: I can reproduce it locally when I use the server's compiler version.. but I still don't know why it crashes
2011-10-26T19:33:11  <jix_> _ulises: yeah but that alone shouldn't be a problem as long as it allows emptying the buffer without blocking
2011-10-26T19:33:20  <jix_> but yeah it probably doesn't
2011-10-26T19:33:33  <jix_> or in 2.9.1 it does and in 2.9.0.1 it doesn't
2011-10-26T19:33:40  <Sakura_> Minthos: Ha!  You have much more chances to fix your problem then.
2011-10-26T19:34:03  <_ulises> jix_: are you providing the scala jars? if so, try with a different version of scala, you never know

2011-10-26T19:47:07  <Sakura_> Zannick: then THAT should be told in the rules. Simple as you formulated it: Coding specifically for maps is prohibited. Know that you won't have access to Final's map before the your last chance submission.
2011-10-26T19:47:42  <McLeopold> it's not prohibited, just useless for the finals
2011-10-26T19:47:45  <avdg2> meh, prohibited is a strong word
2011-10-26T19:47:56  <avdg2> you just get stupid bots anyway :-)
2011-10-26T19:48:36  <jix_> avdg2: but it would distort the live rankings which is bad IMHO
2011-10-26T19:48:44  <Sakura_> who's afraid of strong words? :-)

2011-10-26T19:49:20  <Sakura_> knowing right from the start the enemies hills and how to get there optimally makes bots stupid?  hmmm.
2011-10-26T19:49:39  <jix_> Sakura_: well you don't
2011-10-26T19:49:55  <Zannick> in the last contest all of the starting maps had exactly 19 planets
2011-10-26T19:49:56  <McLeopold> Sakura_: you'd still have to discover the map, but you would probably be able to guess in the first few turns
2011-10-26T19:50:00  <Zannick> but 19 was not in the spec
2011-10-26T19:50:02  <Sakura_> jix_: I sure won't
2011-10-26T19:50:13  <Zannick> so when new maps were generated with a different number, people's bots broke
2011-10-26T19:50:18  <Zannick> because they hardcoded the 19
2011-10-26T19:50:19  <Sakura_> planets?  wut
2011-10-26T19:50:50  <Sakura_> McLeopold: It's pretty quick to know in which map you are; takes only a few turns.
2011-10-26T19:50:59  <jix_> Success: ready to play FINALLY
2011-10-26T19:51:12  <avdg2> jix_: go4it :-)
2011-10-26T19:51:21  <jix_> well the only problem is I have no AI yet ;)
2011-10-26T19:51:23  <McLeopold> Sakura_: so then, we agree? :) "few turns"
2011-10-26T19:52:20  <Sakura_> McLeopold:  which I wouldn't consider "exploring"..  really few turns.  But yes, we agree.  :)
2011-10-26T19:53:12  <Zannick> Sakura_: the last contest involved planets, yes.
2011-10-26T19:53:21  <McLeopold> Unless we release a bunch of maps with no water nearby
2011-10-26T19:53:23  <Sakura_> what are planets?
2011-10-26T19:53:35  <Zannick> the previous contest, Sakura_
2011-10-26T19:53:40  <Zannick> as in not relevant for ants

2011-10-26T20:00:20  <thisisit> It's just that I was designing a bot that learns with every match... but it needs to store what it's leaned every end of a match

2011-10-26T20:01:33  <thisisit> alright...
2011-10-26T20:01:35  <Zannick> thisisit: what you'd want to do, say, is run the bot on your own machine, against the unofficial tcp servers, and then for the official one, upload a fixed data file (and disable writing)

2011-10-26T20:02:30  <Zannick> @tcp
2011-10-26T20:02:32  <contestbot> Zannick: tcp could be http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto.
2011-10-26T20:02:36  <thisisit> oh ok. so it would be playing against real player made bots?
2011-10-26T20:02:52  <Zannick> basically your bot receives and sends it output across tcp
2011-10-26T20:02:58  <antimatroid1> yes, with tcp you run your bot locally against others
2011-10-26T20:03:05  <Zannick> you don't upload it somewhere like the official servers
2011-10-26T20:03:35  <Sakura_Away> @tcp ?  Not sure I understand what means "@tcp".
2011-10-26T20:03:36  <contestbot> Sakura_Away: I have no idea what you mean.
2011-10-26T20:03:37  <thisisit> pefect that's what I need.
2011-10-26T20:03:43  <avdg2> hmm, is the ranking page broken?

2011-10-26T20:03:57  <cyphase> :P

2011-10-26T20:05:26  <Sakura_Away> Zannick: Haaa.. I see. Thanks.   Btw, can we pass some parameters to it before the simulation?   Like adjusting timeout to allow for local debugging?
2011-10-26T20:05:34  <cyphase> hmm.. i just thought that someone could precompute a lot about the various known maps and include it with their bot

2011-10-26T20:06:20  <Zannick> cyphase: right, but running it on a cluster only helps you in the unofficial server
2011-10-26T20:06:26  <cyphase> Zannick, i know
2011-10-26T20:06:35  <Sakura_Away> humm. I was talking about the contestbot amstan
2011-10-26T20:07:03  <Zannick> and there's nothing preventing running stuff on a cluster to precompute some things ;)
2011-10-26T20:07:05  <cyphase> is there some safeguard against bots communicating with the outside world, or will you just be disqualified if it's found out
2011-10-26T20:07:12  <cyphase> i only ask out of curiosity :)
2011-10-26T20:07:14  <Zannick> safeguards, yes.
2011-10-26T20:07:24  <Zannick> safeguards and disqualification
2011-10-26T20:07:39  <Zannick> safeguards, disqualification, and looks of disapproval.
2011-10-26T20:07:49  <Zannick> our chief weapons
2011-10-26T20:07:56  <Puj> Speaking of which, I wonder if there is an explicit code size limit?

2011-10-26T20:08:10  <antimatroid1> there's a limit on the number of files i think
2011-10-26T20:08:15  <Sakura_Away> Zannick: Does the remote tcp bot accepts some parameters regarding timeout etc?
2011-10-26T20:08:15  <cyphase> Puj, the archive has to be <= 2MB i believe
2011-10-26T20:08:18  <amstan> cyphase: maybe even on reddit, so you loose all the precious karma
2011-10-26T20:08:22  <antimatroid1> and did we ever make it so that people could break their sources up into multiple folders?
2011-10-26T20:08:26  <cyphase> okay, okay, i'm not planning anything

2011-10-26T20:09:01  <cyphase> i guess my point with the precomputing is, will the final competition be using fresh maps?

2011-10-26T20:09:17  <antimatroid1> i couldn't do that with planet wars, it was a pita
2011-10-26T20:09:18  <Zannick> you can make local settings on your own bot but they are independent of the game settings like turn time limits
2011-10-26T20:09:26  <Sakura_Away> Zannick: Alright.
2011-10-26T20:09:27  <burny> final comp will be new maps, yes
2011-10-26T20:09:31  <Zannick> cyphase: yes.
2011-10-26T20:09:35  <burny> otherwise there would be no need for map discovery
2011-10-26T20:09:51  <antimatroid1> burny: new maps will be generated
2011-10-26T20:09:54  <cyphase> yea. i guess i didnt think that question through
2011-10-26T20:09:58  <antimatroid1> and only new maps will be used
2011-10-26T20:10:10  <Sakura_Away> Zannick: Too bad cause it would have allowed for sweet local debugging.
2011-10-26T20:10:25  <antimatroid1> you could pre-compute moves for specific situations
2011-10-26T20:10:38  <antimatroid1> but then you need to find the moves too :P
2011-10-26T20:10:39  <Zannick> it's still good debugging
2011-10-26T20:10:44  <Zannick> but you can't control everything
2011-10-26T20:10:57  <burny> I'm going to try to make my AI take the form of a PRGN.. using the visibility as a seed, and the generated numbers, as actions
2011-10-26T20:11:25  <cyphase> hmm
2011-10-26T20:11:30  <Puj> i wonder what the probability of the attack_radius and the visibility_radius changing for the final competition
2011-10-26T20:11:37  <Sakura_Away> Zannick: Sure, but I can't step-in in real time and see exactly what's going on, which I do locally now that I have changed the Turn Time / Timeout values in the engine code.
2011-10-26T20:11:54  <antimatroid1> that would be interesting, write a bot to play thousands of games locally against other bots with a huge time limit, and precompute moves for any battle sitations that it has not come across otherwise use pre computed moved
2011-10-26T20:11:56  <antimatroid1> moves*
2011-10-26T20:12:00  <Zannick> sure

2011-10-26T20:21:50  <Puj> That should be the most efficient, you could make it more efficient with dp, storing the already computed rays for later use when computing subrays and superays of those stored rays.

2011-10-26T20:24:29  <McLeopold> does that matter for the archive?
2011-10-26T20:24:31  <Puj> Well, grom358, you would be scanning at least every tile in vision in that case, which is at best worst than bfs and you would need some trig to get the rotational angles correct, so you may be limiting yourself.
2011-10-26T20:24:53  <grom358> bfs?
2011-10-26T20:24:53  <amstan> McLeopold: it does, because someone will have to actively work on keeping it up

2011-10-26T20:46:12  <grom358> gah.. how to calculate which tiles are on the border of the vision radius
2011-10-26T20:48:32  <bobbydroptable> there should be a function called vision() or get_vision() or the like
2011-10-26T20:48:42  <bobbydroptable> there's some code there that computes the view circle
2011-10-26T20:49:02  <grom358> yeah.. it returns all visible vision tiles.. I just want ones on the edge
2011-10-26T20:49:24  <bobbydroptable> i'm saying , disect that code and figure out how to get only the edges ?
2011-10-26T20:49:43  <grom358> yeah I am.. and I'm stuck

2011-10-26T21:22:07  <Chirmaya> Right then I get a timeout, but I am not sure how I should go about debugging it
2011-10-26T21:22:33  <burny> I wonder how many of the top100 bots, make/made their own path finder
2011-10-26T21:22:57  <bobbydroptable> chirmaya: chances are, it is timing out because it is taking too long to work its way around the wall
2011-10-26T21:23:11  <bobbydroptable> output some messages to stderr
2011-10-26T21:23:17  <Chirmaya> So it could be timing out even though it isn't in an infinite loop?
2011-10-26T21:23:23  <bobbydroptable> yup

2011-10-26T21:24:03  <Chirmaya> Is there a processing timelimit per turn then?
2011-10-26T21:24:06  <bobbydroptable> burny: seeing as there is no pathfinding code in the starterpack, probably a huge proportion?

2011-10-26T22:03:26  <grom358> okay I am using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm .. but I need the tiles in clockwise, anticlockwise order
2011-10-26T22:03:35  <grom358> any ideas how todo that?
2011-10-26T22:04:00  <bobbydroptable> avdg2 lol awesome game
2011-10-26T22:04:08  <f4hy> grom358: I was using midpoint circle, but gave up and did BFS to do the same thing
2011-10-26T22:04:10  <bobbydroptable> grom358 no idea sorry
2011-10-26T22:04:14  <bobbydroptable> probably some sort of trig
2011-10-26T22:04:22  <f4hy> grom358: since you dont really want midpoint circle since there are wallss
2011-10-26T22:04:28  <grom358> f4hy: BFS?
2011-10-26T22:04:34  <f4hy> breadth firsst search
2011-10-26T22:04:37  <f4hy> 100% what you want
2011-10-26T22:05:04  <grom358> f4hy: what are u doing exactly though.. I want to search in clockwise/anticlockwise order
2011-10-26T22:05:29  <f4hy> grom358: oh... why?
2011-10-26T22:05:57  <f4hy> grom358: why not search radially outward, then tag which is the mosst clockwise afterwards
2011-10-26T22:06:13  <f4hy> probably more effiecent anyway
2011-10-26T22:06:14  <grom358> f4hy: most clockwise??
2011-10-26T22:06:24  <f4hy> from wherever you call calling zero
2011-10-26T22:06:33  <f4hy> say north, or wahtever you are searching clockwise
2011-10-26T22:07:12  <grom358> well I have working explore code now.. but it works on single tiles.. trying to extend it to use its field of vision
2011-10-26T22:07:18  <f4hy> do BFS tag everything in the radius you want, then order them based on angle
2011-10-26T22:07:32  <burny> what is the 'problem' with circles?
2011-10-26T22:07:35  <grom358> f4hy: order based on angle?
2011-10-26T22:07:47  <f4hy> grom358: well, how else are your searching clockwise?
2011-10-26T22:07:50  <burny> or, is it not related to tants?
2011-10-26T22:08:18  <grom358> kk.. what I do is ray trace in a direction.. if there is wall.. rotate clockwise

2011-10-26T22:09:12  <grom358> I want to generate the order at loadtime.. eg. Have tile offsets that draw a circle in clockwise order
2011-10-26T22:09:26  <grom358> if I have that.. I just raytrace to each of the tiles
2011-10-26T22:09:29  <burny> what are you drawing for?
2011-10-26T22:09:37  <f4hy> why do you want to raytrace?
2011-10-26T22:09:46  <grom358> well.. not draw as such.
2011-10-26T22:10:00  <grom358> but have list of tiles in order
2011-10-26T22:10:15  <grom358> f4hy: I raytracing to see if I can travel in that direction
2011-10-26T22:10:28  <bobbydroptable> probably has the same problem i did, which is figuring out where to go when an ant has nothing to do, i guess
2011-10-26T22:10:51  <burny> you can't move on angles anyway
2011-10-26T22:10:57  <burny> only horintal/verticle
2011-10-26T22:11:01  <grom358> bobbydroptable: yes.. but i have working code for that.. its just I only look at adjacent tiles
2011-10-26T22:11:12  <grom358> burny: yes the raytrace takes care of that
2011-10-26T22:11:23  <burny> does your ray need to be exactly the right length?
2011-10-26T22:11:38  <burny> and, do you need to hit exactly every tile?
2011-10-26T22:11:42  <grom358> burny: my raytrace works fine already.. I got it going to food with it

2011-10-26T22:12:11  <f4hy> grom358: I have no idea how raytracting could possibly be helpful. If you want to generate circles, BFS is the easiest way to load a 'circles' worth of tiles around a point.
2011-10-26T22:12:16  <grom358> got no problem with my raytrace.. but I'm trying to use it for exploring now
2011-10-26T22:12:41  <avdg2> its even more "extermination" if 8 bots are doing it the same time :-) http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=18431
2011-10-26T22:12:45  <grom358> f4hy: how with the BFS are u working out what direction to travel in??
2011-10-26T22:13:28  <f4hy> grom358: search for target in BFS, find target, move towards it
2011-10-26T22:14:06  <grom358> atm I keep track of visited nodes.. then I try to travel in a certain direction (say NORTH). If can't go that way go to next direction in clockwise/anticlockwise direction
2011-10-26T22:14:20  <f4hy> that is not actually what i do, because my ants don't scan for directions where to go as such, but I do something using 'circles'
2011-10-26T22:14:25  <grom358> and don't travel back to visited nodes unless at deadend
2011-10-26T22:14:31  <janzert> worker pricing shot up to over 10 times the normal price, looks like it's coming back down now though
2011-10-26T22:14:38  <janzert> so they should be back soon

2011-10-26T22:15:18  <grom358> which works fine already.. but what happens is it will go down one row.. then loop back on a row down.. cause it has to physically go to the tile to add it to visited nodes
2011-10-26T22:15:23  <janzert> yeah, I don't remember seeing it go that high before
2011-10-26T22:15:43  <f4hy> I personally never do any searches from an ant. Instead I search outwards from goals

2011-10-26T22:19:36  <bobbydroptable> meaning treat every ant as its own individual
2011-10-26T22:20:01  <burny> hardest part about per-agent, would be makign them not step on each other
2011-10-26T22:20:06  <burny> or, block each other
2011-10-26T22:20:21  <bobbydroptable> well some sort of centralized thing would be necessary

2011-10-26T22:21:31  <bobbydroptable> but ultimately, in agent -oriented
2011-10-26T22:21:57  <bobbydroptable> you assign individual goal/task/objective to each ant and each attempts to achieve it on their own accord
2011-10-26T22:22:10  <f4hy> I dont do anything like that
2011-10-26T22:22:35  <bobbydroptable> most people won't, they just loop through, say, all the food, then move the nearest ant to the food
2011-10-26T22:22:53  <f4hy> I am a physicist, so I don't really know much about AI, so I treated it as a physics problem and had all things that I desire emit a potential field of various strength and radius, and then ants just follow the gradiant to higher potential.
2011-10-26T22:22:58  <bobbydroptable> agent oriented would say "okay ant, here's a list of food, decide which food you want to get to"

2011-10-26T22:23:42  <f4hy> came up with something clever, works fairly well
2011-10-26T22:23:49  <ChrisH_> f4hy: My first bot worked like that too. In AI that's called influence mapping.
2011-10-26T22:24:04  <f4hy> ChrisH_: sweet, I learned what my bot does!
2011-10-26T22:24:23  <f4hy> I redsecovered influence mapping

2011-10-26T22:25:37  <f4hy> ChrisH_: Thanks! all I have been doing is tuing parameters and setting up specific situations where I change what influences what.
2011-10-26T22:26:12  <f4hy> such as if you are near an enemy hive, increase the influence to group up, otherwise spread out. So the various potential fields interact in fun ways
2011-10-26T22:26:20  <ChrisH_> here is another great site for ideas that I've seen others post here:  http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/gameprog.html
2011-10-26T22:27:17  <ChrisH_> f4hy: yeah, it can be fun, but I found it is also difficult to get it tuned in a way that avoids certain bad behaviors
2011-10-26T22:27:39  <ChrisH_> f4hy: but I'm not an expert on the technique either
2011-10-26T22:28:26  <f4hy> ChrisH_: Ya I had some fun isssues to work out. Such has getting stuck at a midpoint between two goals and such
2011-10-26T22:28:33  <ChrisH_> I had a problem early on where four ants would all fight over the same food because they were simultaneously attracted to the food, but repelled from each other
2011-10-26T22:28:35  <grom358> so.. with midpoint circle I get the tiles that make up the edge of the vision and can raytrace to each one.. but its not in clockwise order
2011-10-26T22:28:38  <f4hy> after solving the local extrma isssues htough it works great

2011-10-26T22:30:08  <ChrisH_> My bot is "ChrisH" on the main server. I played a few on the TCP server last week under a different name, but I don't have it up there now.
2011-10-26T22:30:24  <grom358> I'll show u some sample code in a minute.. just packaging it together
2011-10-26T22:30:34  <f4hy> ChrisH_: aww, I leave mine running on the TCP server all day. I just like watching it fight.
2011-10-26T22:30:47  <burny> eg, instead of hitting 10,10  10,11  9,11... could it do 10,10  9,11?
2011-10-26T22:30:58  <f4hy> It is not the best bot, but I think fairly decent considering I only spend 3ms/turn tops.
2011-10-26T22:31:27  <grom358> burny: no.. the path it returns does not have diagonal moves
2011-10-26T22:31:29  <ChrisH_> f4hy: it can be addictive, but I'm doing my development in a single CPU VM, so I don't have the resources to keep a bot running while I code.
2011-10-26T22:31:44  <burny> nevermind
2011-10-26T22:32:35  <f4hy> ChrisH_: I just have the tcp running on a stupid lab computer. copied the binary over and started the script. uses bassically zero cpu so I am not worried.

2011-10-26T22:33:41  <ChrisH_> f4hy: I definitely use more than 3ms per turn, and my code is pretty optimized where it needs to be, but I'm doing a LOT of pathfinding, and it's gotten to the point where I need to look for alternatives to avoid timing out on bit maps with long twisty hallways and trying to path 120 ants halfway across the map.
2011-10-26T22:33:44  <f4hy> ya, running the bot on TCP uses less than 1% cpu on a pretty old machine
2011-10-26T22:34:12  <ChrisH_> I mean, big maps

2011-10-26T22:34:30  <f4hy> I will probably have to add pathfinding eventually

2011-10-26T22:38:45  <bobbydroptable> which means long distances shouldn't be a problem anymore, because I won't need to A* groups of unpassable obstacles
2011-10-26T22:38:58  <bobbydroptable> that being said, I'm still working out the pathfinding
2011-10-26T22:39:10  <bobbydroptable> finding neighbours in a tree isn't very intuitive

2011-10-26T22:39:32  <ChrisH_> bobbydroptable: I implemented A*, but it turns out that many-to-many Djikstra's (my old way) is slower than many to many A* because of the added overhead of the heuristic function.

2011-10-26T22:41:15  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: It's really a BFS with a priority queue so I can have multiple start points, so it's not full Djikstra's with weights (yet)

2011-10-26T22:45:28  <ChrisH_> ohh, woops, in my earlier comment, I meant that my new A* code turned out slower than my old code, even after tuning. It surprised me how much expensive computing lots of manhattan distances with wrapping could be.

2011-10-26T22:58:01  <jcdny>  ChrisH_ is it true that there is no way to do packages in go in the contest given how things are compiled?
2011-10-26T22:58:25  <ChrisH_> jcdny: yes, you get your one main package and that's all
2011-10-26T22:58:27  <ChrisH_> :(
2011-10-26T22:58:50  <jcdny> pesky
2011-10-26T22:59:01  <ChrisH_> Maybe they will let us have packages for the next contest.
2011-10-26T22:59:18  <ChrisH_> or rather, maybe the code that compiles Go can be improved to allow it.
2011-10-26T22:59:39  <jcdny> this is my motivation to learn Go although I think the version I am learning not doing packages is less joyful than it could be
2011-10-26T23:00:07  <ChrisH_> I helped them fix some bugs with it this time around, so maybe I'll contribute some stuff to get packages working for next time.
2011-10-26T23:00:18  <ChrisH_> jcdny: same here
2011-10-26T23:00:57  <jcdny> I absolutely love working in go though.
2011-10-26T23:00:59  <ChrisH_> jcdny: have you tried doing anything with go routines?

2011-10-26T23:01:36  <McLeopold> can you get the visualizer working in the forums?
2011-10-26T23:01:37  <jcdny> planning on having the turn read nonblocking with channels
2011-10-26T23:02:14  <jcdny> and possibly attempting some sort of preemption for idle time calcs.
2011-10-26T23:02:22  <ChrisH_> jcdny: My turn read is all done with channels underneath, but not go routines to drive it
2011-10-26T23:02:57  <ChrisH_> jcdny: yeah, i've considered it too, but so far I'm focusing on the bot logic more
2011-10-26T23:03:39  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, can you get me the javascript that invokes it?
2011-10-26T23:03:49  <ChrisH_> jcdny: what's your bot's name?
2011-10-26T23:03:51  <jcdny> me too.  I think the non blocking reads is really easy though so I might do that soon
2011-10-26T23:03:55  <jcdny> bugnuts
2011-10-26T23:04:16  <McLeopold> amstan: you need the visualizer-min.js and something from the widget.php
2011-10-26T23:04:49  <ChrisH_> cool, hope to see you continue up the charts.
2011-10-26T23:05:04  <jcdny> right now it has no pathfinding so is necessarily pretty limited
2011-10-26T23:05:15  <amstan> McLeopold: i can make the game replay to be inline, or you could give it a game number
2011-10-26T23:05:52  <ChrisH_> yeah, I'm trying to improve the performance of my path finding right now in fact, it is already working and pretty fast, but it needs to be faster so I have more time for combat tactics and other cool stuff on the bigger maps
2011-10-26T23:05:57  <jcdny> I have a good start on prioritizing goals but w/o pathfinding it's not doing much.
2011-10-26T23:06:14  <McLeopold> hmmm, phpbb doesn't do pre tags?

2011-10-26T23:10:25  <ChrisH_> jcdny: I think slices are pretty good under the covers.  I've only been optimizing when forced to, but that has happened multiple times now. I worked through the gopprof examples a few weeks ago, though, and that tool has made figuring out what needs speed improvements so much easier.
2011-10-26T23:11:29  <ChrisH_> and now that you can download the bot input for any game, it is easy to debug timeouts locally by running my code with the input stream and profiling turned on.

2011-10-26T23:31:12  <amstan> mleise: i copied the code from the widget in the main page
2011-10-26T23:31:19  <amstan> yeah, i should probably force fullscreen off
2011-10-26T23:32:11  <mleise> or at least override the user setting in the other parameter called 'config', then the user can still activate it.
2011-10-26T23:32:35  <mleise> That would be 'fullscreen' here: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer/jsdoc/symbols/Config.html
2011-10-26T23:32:36  <amstan> but var config = {};

2011-10-26T23:32:56  <mleise> var config = { fullscreen: false };
2011-10-26T23:32:56  <Sakura_Away> bobby & analyst: thanks.
2011-10-26T23:32:57  <amstan> i set options.embedded = true now
2011-10-26T23:34:22  <amstan> mleise: any other suggestions for the settings?
2011-10-26T23:34:44  <amstan> mleise: i should probably disable the buttons and the keyboard control

2011-10-26T23:35:18  <amstan> mleise: yes, i have to, it makes it impossible to type when replying otherwise.
2011-10-26T23:36:42  <McLeopold> are you going to support inline games or just maps?
2011-10-26T23:37:10  <amstan> McLeopold: i can do replacement of phpbb tags to arbitrary html, so anything is possible
2011-10-26T23:39:49  <McLeopold> then you could do what the wiki does, but probably inforce embedde

2011-10-26T23:48:00  <bobbydroptable> man, the map wrapping adds such an extra complexity =="
2011-10-26T23:48:04  <McLeopold> for what?

2011-10-26T23:51:41  <amstan> McLeopold: that's big
2011-10-26T23:51:44  <amstan> McLeopold: what does it do?
2011-10-26T23:51:55  <amstan> does it handle urls, gameids and data?
2011-10-26T23:52:01  <McLeopold> looks for pre tags, then replaces them with the visualizer
2011-10-26T23:52:05  <McLeopold> no
2011-10-26T23:52:13  <McLeopold> I wouldn't allow game id's in the forums
2011-10-26T23:52:20  <amstan> why not?
2011-10-26T23:52:37  <McLeopold> because links are good enough, just the ability to describe maps and situations

2011-10-26T23:59:28  <ccc_> hi, how to turnoff the turntime value in the tools for local testing, I tried giving large value but it seems to not work (meaning my bot is always crashing)
