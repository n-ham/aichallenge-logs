2011-08-27T10:59:36  <eashoka> delt0r_ : Thanks for trying
2011-08-27T11:07:36  <eashoka> delt0r_ : why does all other bots seem to play only with handful of few selected bots ? that could be the reason for disparity in rate of play among bots. recently have see even the choice of maps get restricted over time. For instance, sir_macelon gets to play in only 4 maps now.

2011-08-27T12:25:55  <mleise> it could also be that the game manager was explicitly looking for 2 player maps and only these two are available

2011-08-27T12:57:24  <mleise> eashoka: again this might be a result of the ranking algorithm converging to a fixed order
2011-08-27T12:57:55  <mleise> I don't say it is good, but probably actually showing a healthy behaviour
2011-08-27T12:59:31  <mleise> The only bots that may really affect DarkMomoBot are these few remaining bots. It's gonna be difficult to change that, I could imagine.
2011-08-27T13:01:40  <mleise> Every player needs the same amount of games, but yet some players are already at a pretty much fixed rank. This might have lead to very small groups of players for each match. And that again results in 1vs1 matches on only two matching maps.

2011-08-27T13:07:01  <eashoka> mleise :You are correct. However, I'm not sure it is a healthy behaviour. looks like a bug to me or an incorrect strategy. we didn't see this opponent locking behaviour in planet wars
2011-08-27T13:08:57  <mleise> we had more activity there
2011-08-27T13:09:38  <eashoka> look for any player (regardless of their rank, skill) who is not in this set and you will see that they are limited to play only with opponents in the given set. the set (which is shrinking) is :
2011-08-27T13:12:59  <eashoka> mleise : (mathis, revolt, UVants, Trumpet, barisdermerdelen, svenhelge, luda, humwum, speedy_consiles, eightball) I may have missed few bots but this seems to be it. (until recently , DarlMomoBot was also in this group) all players I have seen can not play with anybody else but these players. May be this is the bottleneck in the scheduling system.

2011-08-27T13:24:50  <eashoka> I think he was in the set initially but got dropped like darkmomo has
2011-08-27T13:25:30  <mleise> I don't know anything about the match making code, sorry. But I see no obvious reason why you should not play that bot any more.
2011-08-27T13:27:36  <eashoka> yes. it looks like a bug isn't it? everybody in the system(who are not in the set X) can play only against members in set X. right now, set X is seems to be : ( mathis, revolt, UVants, Trumpet, barisdermerdelen, svenhelge, luda, humwum, speedy_consiles, eightball, zounds)
2011-08-27T13:28:57  <eashoka> only 12 bots! and set X too is keep shrinking. so do available maps for all who are outside of X
2011-08-27T13:30:49  <mleise> I don't believe there are fixed sets, but dmj111 or McLeopold probably know what the reason can be
2011-08-27T13:31:05  <eashoka> since everybody else is waiting until one from set X becomes available, they all have to wait for long durations. since opponents are limited, one drifts towards 1-1 games eventually.
2011-08-27T13:32:11  <eashoka> mleise : it is not a fixed set but a result of some bug, I think.
2011-08-27T13:33:08  <mleise> yeah so let's wait and dring a cup of tea :D
2011-08-27T13:33:57  <mleise> we should make a list with all the things that need to be looked upon by McLeopold when he returns
2011-08-27T13:34:05  <eashoka> mleise : yeah :-) I like Green Tea.

2011-08-27T15:30:16  <antimatroid> whilst a strawberry is not
2011-08-27T15:30:20  <mcstar> yeah
2011-08-27T15:30:24  <janzert> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato#Fruit_or_vegetable.3F ;)
2011-08-27T15:30:24  <mcstar> correct
2011-08-27T15:30:48  <janzert> but the US supreme court did declare it a vegetable at one point
2011-08-27T15:31:29  <mcstar> janzert: well, that article wont really change my opinion about tomato
2011-08-27T15:31:32  <antimatroid> lol, I love how the US just does whatever they want, regardless of whether it makes any sense :P
2011-08-27T15:31:37  <eashoka> yeah something like "economically a vegetable and biologically a fruit" I think
2011-08-27T15:31:39  <janzert> :)
2011-08-27T15:32:23  <mcstar> maybe 2 generations from now, people will call it a fruit, but i dont see that happing soon
2011-08-27T15:32:27  <janzert> to be fair it did specifically limit its ruling to whether or not the tomato was a fruit for the purpose of on specific tax law
2011-08-27T15:32:43  <mcstar> f' em
2011-08-27T15:33:06  <mcstar> it will turn out that i piss liquid gold, right?
2011-08-27T15:33:21  <mcstar> ill still call it piss
2011-08-27T15:34:01  <antimatroid> yeah, there is a supermarket here which changed it's name like 15 years ago, I still call it by the old one
2011-08-27T15:34:04  <antimatroid> i refuse to change
2011-08-27T15:34:35  <mcstar> good :)
2011-08-27T15:35:01  <mcstar> gov. of mne changed the name of an important square in the capital city
2011-08-27T15:35:09  <mcstar> old name was Moscow square
2011-08-27T15:35:26  <mcstar> so i can understand the reasoning behind the change :)
2011-08-27T15:35:37  <mcstar> but i still cant get used  to the new name
2011-08-27T15:35:58  <mcstar> its some poet or something, neber heard of it, but i knew where Moscow was
2011-08-27T15:36:04  <mcstar> b->v
