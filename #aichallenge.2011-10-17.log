2011-10-17T01:26:43  <_flag> They just seem to create really chaotic and unpredictable games, which makes it harder to differentiate the good bots from the bad ones

2011-10-17T02:45:08  <antimatroid> i agree, i just put in parameters mcleopold gave me, it shouldn't be hard to reduce the parameters

2011-10-17T02:46:11  <antimatroid> yeah, i have a minimum euclidean distance between hills but in order to allow the parameters asked for it had to be pretty small
2011-10-17T02:47:15  <_flag> You could try making hills belonging to the same player near each other

2011-10-17T09:37:14  <mleise> This challenge is also going to be a bit more complicated than PlanetWars, so it helps if you can understand the English text on the website well. Or if you find someone else who speaks —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π.

2011-10-17T10:07:24  <mcstar> is it too cruel if i laughed?
2011-10-17T10:07:53  <mcstar> did you feel pain? you seemed quite happy on the first pic
2011-10-17T10:08:38  <antimatroid> i don't remember the fall, i was pretty drunk
2011-10-17T10:08:47  <antimatroid> not very fun at the moment :P
2011-10-17T10:10:35  <antimatroid> so, ahhh, what did you guys want anyway :P
2011-10-17T10:10:56  <mcstar> you look quite different on these shots than on the one you showed me earlier with your dog
2011-10-17T10:11:20  <mcstar> injury aside of course
2011-10-17T10:11:33  <antimatroid> dog picture would have been like 3 years ago
2011-10-17T10:11:37  <antimatroid> and with longer hair
2011-10-17T10:11:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you remember that you told me, you couldnt overload arithmetic operators for your matrices?
2011-10-17T10:12:03  <mcstar> for your game-theory framework
2011-10-17T10:12:10  <antimatroid> what?
2011-10-17T10:12:23  <mcstar> you said something like this
2011-10-17T10:12:24  <antimatroid> i can't overload the precedence of operators
2011-10-17T10:12:38  <mcstar> aham
2011-10-17T10:12:41  <mcstar> how so?
2011-10-17T10:12:45  <mcstar> in what way?
2011-10-17T10:13:04  <mcstar> i dont remember what was the exact problem
2011-10-17T10:13:07  <antimatroid> say I overload ^ and * for matrices, I need to say something like C = A*(B^2)
2011-10-17T10:13:22  <antimatroid> at least from memory, otherwise A*B^2 gives (A*B)^2
2011-10-17T10:13:30  <antimatroid> erm
2011-10-17T10:13:39  <antimatroid> yeah that's right
2011-10-17T10:13:46  <mcstar> ok
2011-10-17T10:13:49  <mcstar> i forgot that
2011-10-17T10:14:37  <antimatroid> imo precedence should work so a quadratic f(x) = a.x^2 + b.x + c doesn't need any parentheses
2011-10-17T10:14:57  <mcstar> ^ is xor
2011-10-17T10:15:13  <antimatroid> meh :P i'm a mathematician :P

2011-10-17T10:18:20  <mcstar> you input special symbols with ESC some characters ESC

2011-10-17T10:44:06  <cesteban> Hello, I'm teaching an AI course on Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain. I want my students to participate in the ants challenge. When it is suppose to start?
2011-10-17T10:44:59  <cesteban> Do you think it would be possible to tackle the problem with evolutionary computation? How long does it take to simulate a single match?
2011-10-17T10:45:06  <cesteban> Thanks
2011-10-17T10:45:22  <antimatroid> cesteban: it will hopefully launch in a few days
2011-10-17T10:46:03  <antimatroid> you're welcome to throw whatever you want at it, although note that you only have 0.5 seconds (I think) per turn and you cannot write to file on the official servers
2011-10-17T10:46:21  <cesteban> animatroid: any idea how long it will be open for submitting?
2011-10-17T10:46:23  <antimatroid> but you can of course write to files locally (which includes playing on tcp) if you want to train parameters or whatever if you will
2011-10-17T10:46:28  <antimatroid> 2-3 months i suspect
2011-10-17T10:46:40  <cesteban> Ok, that's perfect
2011-10-17T10:47:01  <antimatroid> you might also want to look into setting up a tcp server just for your students, i can't help you there though :P
2011-10-17T10:47:11  <antimatroid> but competitors in the past have done something like that with their workplace
2011-10-17T10:47:30  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@150.254.83.79> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-10-17T10:48:34  <cesteban> about the evolutionary computation, my only concern is that for training the system we need to simulate thousands of matches. Is there any way of playing against predefined bots in offline mode?
2011-10-17T10:49:28  <antimatroid> i imagine your largest bottleneck would be bot running time rather than network lag for tcp, so that's always helpful
2011-10-17T10:49:44  <antimatroid> otherwise you might find some people willing to share binaries, otherwise you just need to test locally against what you have
2011-10-17T10:50:10  <antimatroid> we encourage people not to actually share code for their bots during the contest so each competitor knows how they've done relative to the other people who have taken the time to write a bot
2011-10-17T10:50:25  <antimatroid> rather than how well they've done to people who have submitted other peoples or slight variations of other peoples bots
2011-10-17T10:51:45  <cesteban> I actually don't care much about the ranking position. Of course, I'll love to win :-) But it is an assignment, so the only important thing is for the students to be able of take part
2011-10-17T10:52:22  <antimatroid> i would be careful about assigning the contest as an assignment? when does the semester end?
2011-10-17T10:52:48  <cesteban> january
2011-10-17T10:52:49  <antimatroid> it really should be launching soon, but personally i'd maybe go for a local tournament then also have students enter the contest if they like?
2011-10-17T10:53:05  <antimatroid> you should be fairly safe i think, but yeah, i can't promise anything :)
2011-10-17T10:53:16  <antimatroid> also, make them use the c++ bot because i wrote that :P
2011-10-17T10:53:49  <antimatroid> anyway, it's 2am, i'm off to bed, night
2011-10-17T10:53:53  <cesteban> Nope, they use Java in this course, sorry :-/
2011-10-17T10:53:58  <antimatroid> :(
2011-10-17T10:54:11  <cesteban> oh, ok, animatroid, thank you very much
2011-10-17T10:54:17  <cesteban> good night :-)

2011-10-17T10:56:41  <mleise> no! no! use the D starter, not the C++ one, because I wrote it
2011-10-17T10:57:03  <mleise> antimatroid: we could have used a specially sized map yesterday :)
2011-10-17T10:58:24  <mcstar> make them use their own starter bots since they are CS students
2011-10-17T10:59:30  <mcstar> the music is not bad on the video, but the poor guy who watched it, will keep wondering wheather blue or green won
2011-10-17T11:00:39  <cesteban> mcstar: I really don't care much about the bots, I'll find out which ones to use, my biggest concern is that an evolutionary algorithm needs to simulate thousands of matches in very short time, and I need to be sure that I can play the game very fast in offline mode (against silly bots if needed)
2011-10-17T11:01:12  <antimatroid> mleise: sorry :)
2011-10-17T11:01:19  <mcstar> what you download is the same framework that the server runs
2011-10-17T11:01:33  <mcstar> cesteban: you can do as fast as your bots give you input
2011-10-17T11:02:17  *** onensora <onensora!~c@188.65.161.142> has quit IRC ()
2011-10-17T11:02:54  <mcstar> of course you can launch many games at parallel, or even, for local development, you can use multi-threaded bots too
2011-10-17T11:03:13  <cesteban> mcstar: Ok, perfect, that's what I needed to know
2011-10-17T11:03:50  <antimatroid> as a past competitor i would advise against having too much difference between the bots you run locally and submit to the official server
2011-10-17T11:04:00  <antimatroid> bugs can be a tricky beast with a bot
2011-10-17T11:04:16  <mleise> cesteban: A few people wrote their own engine last time, but it was easy to implement an engine for PlanetWars. That way you can run several versions of your bot + the engine in one process without parsing text on stdin etc.
2011-10-17T11:04:29  <mcstar> the bot that locally evolutionarily develops an algorithms can and should be very different from the one that he might upload
2011-10-17T11:04:36  <mcstar> -s
2011-10-17T11:04:47  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't know much about that stuff
2011-10-17T11:05:38  <cesteban> Well, What I need is a complete engine that can be played offline very fast
2011-10-17T11:05:49  <cesteban> Is there something like that available
2011-10-17T11:05:50  <cesteban> ?
2011-10-17T11:06:02  <mcstar> the engine is fast, your bots take time to think up their next moves
2011-10-17T11:06:11  <mleise> the complete engine is in the tools package
2011-10-17T11:06:32  <mleise> you are free to consider a python program slow if you like :)
2011-10-17T11:06:50  <cesteban> Ok, perfect, tha engine.py, I assume
2011-10-17T11:07:06  <mleise> really if you want top performance, you'll end up reimplementing it in a native compiling language
2011-10-17T11:07:15  <mcstar> those files are somewhat interconnected i think, look for the imports
2011-10-17T11:07:24  <mcstar> maybe you will need to tweak the sandbox a bit
2011-10-17T11:07:40  <mcstar> compiled?
2011-10-17T11:08:18  <mleise> mcstar: the language should be compiling code, not be compiled itself :p
2011-10-17T11:08:35  <antimatroid> real men program in binary
2011-10-17T11:08:38  <mcstar> cesteban: delt0r wrote a more or less complete engine in java, maybe it suits your needs better
2011-10-17T11:09:08  <mleise> antimatroid: I wrote a GIF viewer in and MD5 algorithm in assembly, is that close enough to binary?
2011-10-17T11:09:23  <antimatroid> nope :P
2011-10-17T11:09:30  <mcstar> pfff
2011-10-17T11:09:35  <antimatroid> punch cards are close enough
2011-10-17T11:09:45  <mcstar> thats not even binary
2011-10-17T11:09:54  <antimatroid> i know, but it sounds almost as tedious
2011-10-17T11:09:59  <mleise> damn, only my father used to have access to such exclusive hardware
2011-10-17T11:10:28  <antimatroid> one of the lecturers at my uni would crack jokes about the old days and how much more careful you were about bugs etc.
2011-10-17T11:11:07  <mcstar> lol, well, yeah without memory protection, you are f'ed
2011-10-17T11:11:09  <cesteban> mcstar: that java engine will be perfect for me
2011-10-17T11:11:26  <cesteban> delt0r_: are you tehre?
2011-10-17T11:11:35  <mcstar> probably not
2011-10-17T11:11:41  <mcstar> but usually he is around
2011-10-17T11:11:42  <cesteban> delt0r_: you are my only hope lol
2011-10-17T11:11:59  <mcstar> i dont think he implemented the hills
2011-10-17T11:12:20  <mcstar> mleise: did delt0r know about the "surprise" changes?
2011-10-17T11:12:29  <cesteban> ok, I'll try again later. At what time does he usually connects?
2011-10-17T11:12:54  <mcstar> think in GMT
2011-10-17T11:12:55  <antimatroid> lol, you need to specify a timezone here :P
2011-10-17T11:13:19  <cesteban> yes, that was my next question
2011-10-17T11:13:25  <cesteban> where does he lives?
2011-10-17T11:13:26  <cesteban> lol
2011-10-17T11:13:26  <antimatroid> (also, i'm just terrible at going to bed, i wasn't trying to stop talking to you before :P)
2011-10-17T11:13:56  <mcstar> he is GMT+1 i think
2011-10-17T11:14:06  <cesteban> animatroid: don't worry, Ia ppreciate a lot your help ;-)
2011-10-17T11:14:09  <mcstar> at least i am, and he is pretty close
2011-10-17T11:16:50  <cesteban> Ok, GTM+1 is very close to me, that will be easy

2011-10-17T11:31:17  <mleise> what? pascal?
2011-10-17T11:31:57  <mleise> delt0r did not know about ant hills. only those who needed to know, knew
2011-10-17T11:34:34  <mleise> Ugzuzg: hi. do you have the tools?
2011-10-17T11:34:58  <Ugzuzg> mleise: yep
2011-10-17T11:35:45  <mleise> look at play_one_game.sh/.cmd or play_one_game_live.sh/.cmd. These scripts start a game with 4 python bots
2011-10-17T11:36:10  <mleise> You can replace one of those with your pascal program. its really simple
2011-10-17T11:37:35  <Ugzuzg> mleise: i did it

2011-10-17T11:39:43  <mleise> If you want to print stuff on the console you'll need to write to stderr. I'm not sure how to do that in pascal, yet.
2011-10-17T11:39:45  <cesteban> mleise: so you mean that delt0r engine is not complete?
2011-10-17T11:40:03  <mleise> delt0r has an engine?
2011-10-17T11:40:30  <mleise> if it is on github you can probably check the date
2011-10-17T11:40:48  <mleise> if it was updated after the switch to ant hills, it probably works
2011-10-17T11:42:30  <McLeopold> cesteban: You might try creating a large set of very small 2 player maps, then you could simulate a lot more matches

2011-10-17T11:44:44  <cesteban> but I just tried the play_one_game.sh recommended by mleise, and the problem is that it is slooooow
2011-10-17T11:44:55  <cesteban> takes several minutes to make 1000 turns
2011-10-17T11:45:13  <cesteban> it is because the size of the default map, or because of the bots logic?
2011-10-17T11:46:32  <mleise> cesteban: did you try with only dummy bots?
2011-10-17T11:46:41  <mleise> to see if it is the engine or the bots?
2011-10-17T11:47:47  <mleise> smaller maps will help in any case of course. usually if you want to test fighting it would be bad if you had to wait 500 turns until the bots get to meet each other with more than one ant :p

2011-10-17T12:11:14  <mcstar> cesteban: do you want to make an evolutionary bot, or you want each and every one of the class do one?
2011-10-17T12:12:36  <cesteban> I want the students to evolve a bot using Genetic Programming (GP)
2011-10-17T12:13:02  <mcstar> if its not a secret, what part do you want to handle with GP?
2011-10-17T12:13:55  <cesteban> the logic of the bot, I'm still not sure, because I don't know the details of the game
2011-10-17T12:14:17  <mcstar> for example, do you want to use a sort of influence mappings, and compute aim-functions that combine variables with a GP tuneable logic?
2011-10-17T12:14:33  <McLeopold> cesteban: well, in general, a bot will need to be able to do pathfinding, so limiting the GP to attacking or food gathering might be best
2011-10-17T12:14:54  <cesteban> yes, it is a possibility
2011-10-17T12:15:19  <McLeopold> plus, you need to attack hills for points, so if points is your only performance function, it will be slow to learn

2011-10-17T12:16:25  <mcstar> cesteban: are you worried that maybe one of your students will write a better bot than you?
2011-10-17T12:16:36  <mcstar> :D
2011-10-17T12:18:16  <mcstar> McLeopold: that would make sense, if the ants could communicate with each other more efficiently, but since theres one entity that has all the bots information and drives the ants, i dont see the point in ant colony optimization

2011-10-17T14:46:34  <vladimirfol> hello. i have no idea how solve problem of jamming ants, with big groups of ants.
2011-10-17T14:46:39  <mcstar> from the previous guy's questions it seems its not trivial that you have to have python to run the game
2011-10-17T14:46:47  <vladimirfol> in this moment im using BFS algorithm to find ant's path, but when group of ants moves in same direction i must recalculate ants path (when ant will sit to other one in next step) it takes much time.
2011-10-17T14:46:53  <vladimirfol> i thought about making "time of diverge". i.e. every 40 game turns, ants in group must depart from each other to big distance. but this idea not seem good for me.
2011-10-17T14:46:58  <vladimirfol> i will be happy if somebody share with me their ideas

2011-10-17T18:18:48  <Larose> I repeatedly have this error when I send my submission: "turn    0 bot 0 timed out". Is is possible to get more feebback?
2011-10-17T18:24:45  <mleise> McLeopold, janzert: ping
2011-10-17T18:26:54  <Zannick> isn't turn 0 when you get the basic info and have to say "ready"?
2011-10-17T18:27:04  <McLeopold> mleise: hey
2011-10-17T18:27:12  <McLeopold> Zannick: yes it is
2011-10-17T18:27:26  <Zannick> Larose: ^
2011-10-17T18:27:51  <McLeopold> Larose: if your bot times out on turn 0, it probably means the program crashed and we didn't get anything on stderr or stdout
2011-10-17T18:28:06  <McLeopold> so, there might be nothing that we can report
2011-10-17T18:28:30  <McLeopold> Larose: what language are you using?
2011-10-17T18:28:49  <Larose> C++
2011-10-17T18:28:55  <Larose> It works fine on ma machine
2011-10-17T18:29:03  <Larose> my*
2011-10-17T18:29:14  <McLeopold> Did you test with test_bot.sh?
2011-10-17T18:30:06  <Larose> Yes
2011-10-17T18:30:39  <McLeopold> What is you username?
2011-10-17T18:30:59  <Larose> mathieu
2011-10-17T18:31:00  <mleise> McLeopold: I was pinging you for Larose's issue. I see several reports of 'time outs' and I wonder if it happens with one language exclusively or if any more information can be given. Does the system report for example if the bot program was executable or if an interpreter or VM returned an error code?
2011-10-17T18:31:51  <McLeopold> mleise: we open a subprocess and only capture stderr and stdout, nothing else
2011-10-17T18:32:01  <McLeopold> so, only if the language vm does
2011-10-17T18:32:14  <McLeopold> C++ probably won't give us anything extra
2011-10-17T18:32:47  <mleise> What happens if the C++ program could not be executed for some reason?
2011-10-17T18:33:02  <McLeopold> turn 0 timeout, like he is seeing
2011-10-17T18:33:56  <McLeopold> I'm surprised our test games don't pick this up
2011-10-17T18:34:06  <mleise> If Python allows to check the child pid it may be nice for the support task force *g* to get more information.
2011-10-17T18:34:35  <mleise> submission test games?
2011-10-17T18:34:38  <McLeopold> yes
2011-10-17T18:34:45  <mleise> locally or on the server?
2011-10-17T18:34:51  <McLeopold> on the server
2011-10-17T18:34:52  <mleise> it *always* runs locally :-/
2011-10-17T18:35:34  <McLeopold> oh, he's *is* failing on the test game :)
2011-10-17T18:36:00  <mleise> not locally though I suspect, just on the server
2011-10-17T18:36:29  <mleise> And there everything seems to be a timeout, no matter what the actual technical background is :p
2011-10-17T18:36:59  <mleise> well, I think it catches actual invalid code quite well
2011-10-17T18:37:34  <mleise> I remember that I had a 32-bit/64-bit error that the compiler catched and I could read about that in my profile
2011-10-17T18:37:35  <McLeopold> what else could we capture for a C++ program failing to launch?
2011-10-17T18:37:54  <mleise> "failed to start sub process" ?
2011-10-17T18:38:09  <McLeopold> ok, but other than that?
2011-10-17T18:38:15  <mleise> "program printed xyz on stderr" ?
2011-10-17T18:38:25  <McLeopold> we didn't get anything on stderr
2011-10-17T18:38:33  <McLeopold> he would need to add it
2011-10-17T18:39:00  <mleise> does the system tell you if there was output on stderr?
2011-10-17T18:39:01  <McLeopold> the turn 0 error is injected at the end of stderror
2011-10-17T18:39:09  <mleise> ok
2011-10-17T18:39:26  <mleise> That should help me with questions on the forums.
2011-10-17T18:40:10  <mleise> no text really means, the bot didn't get to the line of code where it writes to stderr (and flushes the buffer)
2011-10-17T18:42:26  <Larose> Did my program crash or fail to launch?
2011-10-17T18:46:49  <mleise> McLeopold: want to hear a really out-of-the-box idea?
2011-10-17T18:47:05  <mleise> *do you ...
2011-10-17T18:47:14  <McLeopold> yes?
2011-10-17T18:47:32  <McLeopold> Larose: don't know yet, still looking
2011-10-17T18:47:33  <mleise> wrap the call in strace :D
2011-10-17T18:49:21  <McLeopold> hmm, Larose's code works on the server for a test game...
2011-10-17T18:49:32  <mleise> that's weird, no?
2011-10-17T18:49:45  <McLeopold> unless my compile was different from the worker one
2011-10-17T18:50:09  <mleise> did you just run compile_anything.py in the bot directory?
2011-10-17T18:50:17  <McLeopold> no, I should have...
2011-10-17T18:51:38  <McLeopold> okay, still works
2011-10-17T18:53:01  <mleise> do you have the actual resulting executable from the worker that compiled it?
2011-10-17T18:53:16  <McLeopold> no
2011-10-17T18:53:23  <McLeopold> I need to find the worker first
2011-10-17T18:53:24  <mleise> no access?
2011-10-17T18:53:34  <McLeopold> as long as it didn't get restarted
2011-10-17T18:57:51  <McLeopold> janzert: what's the proper way to stop a worker?
2011-10-17T18:58:04  <mleise> init 6
2011-10-17T18:58:17  <McLeopold> no, he wanted a stop file somewhere
2011-10-17T19:01:24  <mleise> McLeopold: Anyway if it ever helps, you can run strace unintrusively like this: strace -o <output file> <command>
2011-10-17T19:01:42  <McLeopold> I don't think I could interpret the results :)
2011-10-17T19:02:34  <mleise> It just prints in clear text, the system function calls. It could for example show when a bot was waiting for stdin.
2011-10-17T19:03:31  <mleise> "poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 2147483647) = ?" is what my bot prints in this case, and fd=0 is stdin
2011-10-17T19:03:56  <McLeopold> ok, still waiting for the worker to finish a game
2011-10-17T19:08:29  <McLeopold> mleise: okay, I got the entry to fail on the submission test, but it only fails in the jail
2011-10-17T19:09:14  <Larose> I got to go, McLeopold, mleise, thanks for your help, this is very appreciated. I'ill be back in about 2 hours, let me know if I can be of any help!
2011-10-17T19:12:29  <mleise> McLeopold: how does it fail? does it not start? segfault? wait for stdin?
2011-10-17T19:13:08  <mleise> is it missing a library in the jail?
2011-10-17T19:13:15  <McLeopold> mleise: not sure, it's in the jail
2011-10-17T19:14:46  <j3camero> What up gangstas? We now have the promise of some server money from Google. I am thinking we should maybe put up the site today.
2011-10-17T19:14:56  <j3camero> But first, dinner. Will be back soon.
2011-10-17T19:16:09  <Zannick> :)
2011-10-17T19:16:24  <amstan> j3camero: see my emails
2011-10-17T19:16:42  <mleise> j3camero: nice to hear, I thought they commited to that donation already, but hey.
2011-10-17T19:18:06  <mleise> McLeopold: Try using strace in the jail if you can get text files out of it. It will also show what dlls were accessed, what files, network access, anything
2011-10-17T19:18:46  <mleise> just for the submission tests, so we have all the information to debug unexpected failures

2011-10-17T19:22:18  <amstan> he removed the alias line, but then he also disabled the whole host
2011-10-17T19:22:25  <McLeopold> and then he yelled "KHAAN!"

2011-10-17T20:55:35  <aarossig> maybe we could do Ai with the dot on the i circling around the Ai kind of like the @ symbol
2011-10-17T20:55:35  <Zannick> the terrifying squares of tron
2011-10-17T20:55:35  <aarossig> something very simple... I need to put some thought into this
2011-10-17T20:55:35  <Zannick> the relentless triangles of planet wars
2011-10-17T20:55:35  <aarossig> lol
2011-10-17T20:55:48  <aarossig> I will think about it
2011-10-17T20:56:08  <Zannick> or better yet
2011-10-17T20:56:20  <aarossig> we could also just use AI Challenge in the Ubuntu font as our logo
2011-10-17T20:56:21  <Zannick> "AI Challenge" superimposed on a red circle
2011-10-17T20:56:26  <aarossig> yeah, exactly
2011-10-17T20:56:33  <aarossig> something very simple like that would suffice
2011-10-17T20:56:43  <Zannick> red circle =~ HAL9000
2011-10-17T20:56:49  <aarossig> ahhh
2011-10-17T20:56:51  <j3camero> Also, Japan.
2011-10-17T20:56:56  <aarossig> lol
2011-10-17T20:57:01  <aarossig> yeah, that would be interesting
2011-10-17T20:57:07  <Zannick> only with a white background
2011-10-17T20:57:12  <j3camero> Although any allusion to HAL would be awesome for an AI Challenge.
2011-10-17T20:57:28  <aarossig> I like nature in logos, whenever I see a leaf I am thinking "cool brand."
2011-10-17T20:57:39  <aarossig> we could do something like that.. no entirely sure
2011-10-17T20:57:46  <j3camero> Could we get something where if you read it upside down and backwards it says "Skynet"? Especially with the Google sponsorship, could be kinda funny. I am only half kidding.
2011-10-17T20:57:55  <aarossig> lol
2011-10-17T20:58:26  <aarossig> we could make it one of those images where you tilt the screen back and it says "Why are you looking at your screen at such an awkward angle?"
2011-10-17T20:58:53  <aarossig> anyway, leave it with me
2011-10-17T20:59:02  <aarossig> I will do something...
2011-10-17T20:59:14  <aarossig> oh!
2011-10-17T20:59:47  <aarossig> what about an element from the periodic table? Ai
2011-10-17T20:59:49  <aarossig> or AI
2011-10-17T21:00:19  <aarossig> hmm, anyway -- I must go
2011-10-17T21:00:28  <aarossig> I'll get back to you guys
2011-10-17T21:01:07  <j3camero> A brain image is another idea.
2011-10-17T21:02:06  <j3camero> Or some variant of an "electronic brain" that can be found in Hollywood movies. Like, clear tubes and blue light.

2011-10-17T21:18:20  <j3camero> aarossig: I saw the YT video you created. Freaking awesome stuff.
2011-10-17T21:19:38  <j3camero> Can you create an edition that starts right off with visual gameplay? Like what starts around 0:55 in the current edition. I am thinking we could use that with the official launch.
2011-10-17T21:32:16  <aarossig> j3camero: sure, I can work on something more "HEY, COME SEE WHAT WE HAVE!" and less introductory
2011-10-17T21:32:26  <aarossig> I have a proposition...
2011-10-17T21:32:51  <aarossig> did we decide on worker servers yet?

2011-10-17T22:14:33  <aarossig> I may have 6 - 8 identical, relatively beefy computers coming to me
2011-10-17T22:14:52  <j3camero> aarossig: yeah that is the sort of video that we need for this specific purpose. Don't get me wrong, we also need the introductory component. We can use it on the main site. It's just today that we need something that convinces people to bother visiting the site.
2011-10-17T22:15:07  <aarossig> core2duo, 1.6Hz, 2GB RAM
2011-10-17T22:15:10  <j3camero> aarossig: intriguing.
2011-10-17T22:15:20  <aarossig> afaik, 64bit
2011-10-17T22:15:25  <aarossig> 99% sure
2011-10-17T22:15:57  <aarossig> anyway, I'm not committing to anything yet -- this is all very up in the air
2011-10-17T22:16:05  <j3camero> If you're generous enough to donate a few weeks/months of machine time, we may be able to work something out.
2011-10-17T22:16:26  <aarossig> yeah, that's what I was thinking -- maybe just cover my hydro costs or something
2011-10-17T22:16:26  <amstan> aarossig: problem is the internet connection
2011-10-17T22:16:41  <aarossig> I assume that a standard dsl connection should be fine for this purpose
2011-10-17T22:16:48  <j3camero> I have always felt that a diverse set of user-owned machines would be cool. Would be an easy way for people to get involved and help out and such.
2011-10-17T22:16:57  <aarossig> yeah, the issue is fairness
2011-10-17T22:17:06  <aarossig> but with identical machines, that problem is alleviated
2011-10-17T22:17:06  <j3camero> But most people feel very strongly that the machines must be identical.
2011-10-17T22:17:11  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-17T22:17:19  <amstan> janzert should be asked about it
2011-10-17T22:17:27  <j3camero> Yes of course. It's his call really.
2011-10-17T22:17:36  <aarossig> god -- this windows server behind me sounds like a blender.
2011-10-17T22:17:40  <aarossig> tick tick tick
2011-10-17T22:18:11  <j3camero> Haha yeah. We use a lot of Windows servers where I work. 99 problems...
2011-10-17T22:18:23  <aarossig> anyway, if you are open to this proposition I can try to get a hold of these machines and try to help
2011-10-17T22:18:38  <aarossig> j3camero: honestly, my old Pentium 4 running LLinux does less work.
2011-10-17T22:18:47  <aarossig> and the office is closed too
2011-10-17T22:18:49  <j3camero> I am up for exploring it yep. More workers is better in my opinion.
2011-10-17T22:18:55  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-17T22:19:10  <amstan> j3camero: do you have the info on the workers we use so far?
2011-10-17T22:19:19  <j3camero> Nope. Ask janzert.
2011-10-17T22:19:31  <j3camero> I should probably know that though.
2011-10-17T22:20:07  <aarossig> oh my god, i hate shopping for psu's
2011-10-17T22:20:14  <aarossig> i wish I was never shown the tiered list
2011-10-17T22:20:28  <amstan> aarossig: how much do you wanna spend?
2011-10-17T22:20:29  <aarossig> I'm just alt-tabbing between tiger direct and the list
2011-10-17T22:20:44  <aarossig> amstan: <100, preferably 80 gold
2011-10-17T22:21:00  <aarossig> it's a server, and I have a firm belief that a good psu goes a long way
2011-10-17T22:21:02  <amstan> look for the price of the ocz, 600W
2011-10-17T22:21:06  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-17T22:21:08  <aarossig> i like those
2011-10-17T22:21:13  <amstan> i use it in my comp, it was 120 at the time though
2011-10-17T22:21:26  <aarossig> looking at this one: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=7195036&CatId=1483
2011-10-17T22:21:38  <aarossig> it's a good price, tier 2, 80 bronze
2011-10-17T22:22:03  <amstan> j3camero: so.. how are we doing on the archival server?
2011-10-17T22:25:25  <j3camero> Probably not happening today. I am going to bed soon.
2011-10-17T22:25:33  <j3camero> Does it have to be its own server?
2011-10-17T22:25:44  <j3camero> Would be so much more free if we used my existing server :-)
2011-10-17T22:27:14  <amstan> it would be nice if it were standalone
2011-10-17T22:27:43  <amstan> i just don't like that every contest we lost some data, i would like to preserve planet wars well at least
2011-10-17T22:28:00  <j3camero> True. I have always been too lazy to make a really good archive.
2011-10-17T22:28:22  <amstan> i can take care of that, but i want a blank server
2011-10-17T22:28:35  <amstan> it can be the lowest tier, i don't care(as long as there's bandwidth)
2011-10-17T22:28:59  <amstan> last beta server was fairly cheap, $7 a month

2011-10-17T23:39:03  <nomad_man> Hi, any of hte devs around?  i've got an issue, i'm submitting my bot to the site and it claims: Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases. The error reported: turn    1 bot 0 crashed.   However when i run the local test and games it's not a problem.
2011-10-17T23:39:54  <amstan> nomad_man: some bots fail because they're not used to the test case, have you actually run the specific test case?
2011-10-17T23:40:03  <amstan> ./test_bot.sh|cmd i think
2011-10-17T23:40:08  <nomad_man> it does not say which test case
2011-10-17T23:40:11  <nomad_man> i'm under win
2011-10-17T23:40:23  <amstan> there's only one test case
2011-10-17T23:40:26  <nomad_man> and yes i did test
2011-10-17T23:40:29  <nomad_man> E:\Code\AI_challenge\tools>test_bot.cmd MyBot.exe running for 30 turns
2011-10-17T23:40:41  <nomad_man> playerturns 1 1 waiting 0.25 seconds for bots to process end turn
2011-10-17T23:40:42  <amstan> what launguage?
2011-10-17T23:40:45  <nomad_man> C#
2011-10-17T23:40:54  <nomad_man> actually hold on i  think i'm reading this incrrectly
2011-10-17T23:41:05  <nomad_man> brb
2011-10-17T23:41:11  <amstan> hmm, not sure, what are you compiling with? we're using mono so there might be a diff
2011-10-17T23:41:41  <nomad_man> amstan: i didn't read the output correctly from the test script
2011-10-17T23:41:49  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-10-17T23:41:55  <amstan> well, there you go :P
2011-10-17T23:42:01  <amstan> :D *
2011-10-17T23:42:18  <nomad_man> it does state the fact that it did crash, just in the middle somewhere :)
2011-10-17T23:42:19  <nomad_man> status crashed survived
2011-10-17T23:42:31  <nomad_man> and the line was also in the middle of the output
2011-10-17T23:43:19  <nomad_man> except still no way of knowing what exxactly it fails :)
2011-10-17T23:44:03  <amstan> i think you can edit ./test_bot.cmd and add some -v flags
2011-10-17T23:44:19  <amstan> you can also watch the replay
2011-10-17T23:44:51  <Larose> nomad_man: My bot repeatedly times out on turn 0, I'm debugging it right now. Everything you output to cerr with be appears on the page
2011-10-17T23:45:16  <nomad_man> Larose: what are you writing it in?
2011-10-17T23:45:28  <Larose> And if it could help, it "crashed" at when I read the seed
2011-10-17T23:45:54  <nomad_man> i did add stuff to tokenizer
2011-10-17T23:46:02  <Larose> I output "before function" .. "after function"
2011-10-17T23:46:21  <nomad_man> includig the seed, the quality of the C3 sample bot and package was a little disappointing
2011-10-17T23:46:27  <nomad_man> s/C3/c#
2011-10-17T23:46:29  <Larose> To narrow down the bug
2011-10-17T23:47:10  <janzert> amstan: I really don't think you want a 301 redirect on those domains to beta.aichallenge.org, it means when the contest launches you'll have people that are going to have a hard time reaching aichallenge.org because their browser will be wanting to go to the redirect
2011-10-17T23:47:30  <janzert> if you really want to redirect right now a 307 might be a better choice
2011-10-17T23:47:47  <janzert> although I'm not really sure what is gained by it anyway
2011-10-17T23:48:57  <amstan> janzert: well, i don't want all these domains pointing to the same contest, google will get confused
2011-10-17T23:49:07  <amstan> 307 you say?
2011-10-17T23:49:13  <janzert> so don't publish them ;)
2011-10-17T23:49:28  <janzert> yes, 307 is a temporary redirect
2011-10-17T23:49:34  <amstan> yeah, easy to say that though: http://www.google.ca/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&q=aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com&oq=aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=26l2661l0l2771l26l22l0l15l0l1l181l1023l0.7l7l0
2011-10-17T23:49:59  <janzert> but aichallengebeta.hypretriangle.com will presumably just go away after beta right?
2011-10-17T23:50:06  <amstan> yes
2011-10-17T23:50:21  <janzert> and anyway you certainly don't want aichallenge.org permanently going to beta.aichallenge.org
2011-10-17T23:50:24  <amstan> so they're all permanent redirects, except aichallenge.org
2011-10-17T23:50:41  <janzert> ai-contest.com
2011-10-17T23:50:43  <amstan> sigh, do i need 2 redirect files then?
2011-10-17T23:50:52  <janzert> although no requests will come in for that anyway
2011-10-17T23:51:00  <amstan> ai-contest.com, if we're going to be phasing it out, it should be 301 too
2011-10-17T23:51:11  <janzert> not to beta.aichallenge.org though
2011-10-17T23:51:21  <amstan> yeah, ok
2011-10-17T23:51:24  <amstan> what do you propose though?
2011-10-17T23:51:36  <janzert> just let the beta urls go without a redirect
2011-10-17T23:51:51  <janzert> permanent redirect ai-contest.com to aichallenge.org
2011-10-17T23:52:03  <janzert> let aichallenge.org be the beta site for now
2011-10-17T23:52:19  <janzert> the beta urls are basically just temporary urls
2011-10-17T23:53:00  <janzert> probably want a 301 on both ai-contest.com and www.ai-contest.com
2011-10-17T23:53:17  <janzert> maybe www.aichallenge.org as well
2011-10-17T23:53:43  <janzert> depending on which side of "www." usage you fall on ;)
2011-10-17T23:53:57  <amstan> i like without
2011-10-17T23:54:05  <janzert> I do as well
2011-10-17T23:54:50  <amstan> ok.. now, why is apache sensitive about the order these configs are loaded in
2011-10-17T23:54:59  <amstan> i had it all clearly known a few hours ago, but now it's late
2011-10-17T23:55:11  <janzert> :/
2011-10-17T23:55:23  <amstan> apparently the redirects have to load after the main site
2011-10-17T23:55:28  <amstan> or else it redirects other things too
2011-10-17T23:55:42  <amstan> does apache treat an unknown host with the first vhost it sees?
2011-10-17T23:55:52  <janzert> I believe so yes
2011-10-17T23:56:12  <amstan> or the one with a *
2011-10-17T23:56:14  <amstan> ok
2011-10-17T23:56:41  <janzert> right the first one that matches the VirtualHost address
2011-10-17T23:56:46  <nomad_man> debuging this is a pain :(
2011-10-17T23:57:17  <nomad_man> can you input map directly into the bot?
2011-10-17T23:57:25  <nomad_man> or do you have to do it turn based
2011-10-17T23:57:39  <janzert> the map format is different than what a bot is given
2011-10-17T23:58:08  <janzert> so no, you have to feed the bot the appropriate information
2011-10-17T23:58:55  <amstan> janzert: so why does the worker stuff die when it's a redirect?
2011-10-17T23:59:14  <janzert> pretty sure python's httplib doesn't follow redirects
2011-10-17T23:59:40  <janzert> at least not in it's default configuration
2011-10-17T23:59:41  <amstan> janzert: can you code the next gen workers to use the permanent address?
