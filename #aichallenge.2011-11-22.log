2011-11-22T00:00:09  <bmh> thestinger: make a bayesian model and eliminate those hypotheses (about the number of opponents) that are inconsistent with the data!

2011-11-22T00:01:41  <BenJackson> that's from the DB schema
2011-11-22T00:01:45  <thestinger> the starting positions and varied bot skills makes testing stuff pretty hard

2011-11-22T00:02:04  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-11-22T00:02:24  <thestinger> and I don't really trust the ranking on the tcp server
2011-11-22T00:02:38  <BenJackson> oh hell no
2011-11-22T00:02:41  <thestinger> because good bots start off with new names and bring my bot way down in ranking if I lose, etc.
2011-11-22T00:02:50  <thestinger> have to watch so many damn replays
2011-11-22T00:03:02  <BenJackson> I think my bots are ranked lower on all the tcp servers than on the actual challenge site
2011-11-22T00:03:18  <thestinger> well, look at the top 30 bots
2011-11-22T00:03:25  <thestinger> it's like 8 people with different versions
2011-11-22T00:03:52  <thestinger> maybe more than 8 :P
2011-11-22T00:04:08  <thestinger> I have suspicions that a lot of the bots are the same people even tho the names are different
2011-11-22T00:04:22  <BenJackson> just to get in the spirit I'll start a second bot on fluxid
2011-11-22T00:04:34  <bmh> thestinger: don't worry about starting positions when inferring the number of bots. Just think about the size of the map and how many bots you could actually fit
2011-11-22T00:04:56  <thestinger> there are some crazy maps though :\

2011-11-22T00:38:19  <antimatroid> only because it's so random on when a game will or wont be allowed to last that long
2011-11-22T00:38:23  <bhasker> so if we collect more than 1 food its all stored in the hill is it?
2011-11-22T00:38:29  <bhasker> and an ant is spawned every turn?
2011-11-22T00:38:33  <antimatroid> bhasker: yep, that's your hive
2011-11-22T00:38:39  <antimatroid> although you may have more than one hill
2011-11-22T00:38:49  <bhasker> can more than one ant spawn on a hill in a single turn?
2011-11-22T00:38:50  <antimatroid> and there's a possible random tie break on which hill may spawn an ant
2011-11-22T00:38:55  <antimatroid> makes life complicated
2011-11-22T00:39:03  <antimatroid> only a single ant can spawn on each hill per turn

2011-11-22T00:39:23  <antimatroid> an ant will spawn at the hill that spawned an ant longest ago that can spawn an ant, if there's a tie it breaks it randomly
2011-11-22T00:39:25  <a1k0n> hard to expand with that kind of pressure
2011-11-22T00:39:30  <bhasker> ah k

2011-11-22T01:27:53  <bhasker> so antimatroid what are you using to explore the map and guide the ants?
2011-11-22T01:31:30  <antimatroid> bhasker: for food/enemy/hill collection a* with multi sources and multi targets
2011-11-22T01:31:49  <bhasker> and when nothing is available?
2011-11-22T01:31:52  <antimatroid> for unseen/not recently seen squares just bfs with multi source
2011-11-22T01:32:03  <antimatroid> what do you mean nothing available?
2011-11-22T01:32:09  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-11-22T01:32:10  <antimatroid> i'll "reuse moved ants" when collecting food too
2011-11-22T01:32:29  <bhasker> i meant when no food/enemy or hill is around your ants
2011-11-22T01:32:30  <antimatroid> i've got some battle code going too
2011-11-22T01:32:46  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-11-22T01:33:23  <antimatroid> just do all the other stuff
2011-11-22T01:34:07  <antimatroid> battle code is what's most interesting to me at the moment though
2011-11-22T01:34:09  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-11-22T01:34:17  <antimatroid> have you played with that yet?
2011-11-22T01:34:17  <bhasker> my battle code needs work:-\
2011-11-22T01:34:23  <antimatroid> what are you doing?
2011-11-22T01:34:39  <bhasker> well mostly i build adhoc squads then step them one step toward target
2011-11-22T01:34:44  <bhasker> do the same for the targets
2011-11-22T01:34:50  <bhasker> then for each new location of the ants in the squad
2011-11-22T01:34:54  <bhasker> i do a battle resolution
2011-11-22T01:35:08  <bhasker> each local battle results in 1/0/-1
2011-11-22T01:35:09  <antimatroid> i'm partitioning ants up into those that could land in battles, then for enemies and friend ants picking a set of "offensive" and a set of "defensive" moves then basically run minimax on that
2011-11-22T01:35:16  <antimatroid> cause it's a 2x2 game it's quite fast
2011-11-22T01:35:25  <bhasker> yea i am not doing a full minimax yet
2011-11-22T01:35:28  <bhasker> need to do that
2011-11-22T01:35:33  <antimatroid> this isn't a full minimax
2011-11-22T01:35:35  <bhasker> its just like 1-2 step
2011-11-22T01:35:38  <antimatroid> i did that and it was fairly slow
2011-11-22T01:35:45  <antimatroid> even for smaller partitions
2011-11-22T01:35:48  <bhasker> i just do 1 step of mine and enemy
2011-11-22T01:35:50  <bhasker> for each ant
2011-11-22T01:35:52  <bhasker> and sum the battle results
2011-11-22T01:36:02  <bhasker> the problem is i am not generating all possible paths
2011-11-22T01:36:07  <bhasker> from my ant totarget
2011-11-22T01:36:14  <bhasker> so i might get a good result along one path
2011-11-22T01:36:19  <bhasker> but along another path i might lose
2011-11-22T01:36:33  <bhasker> so if the enemy picks the other one my bot loses the battle sometimes
2011-11-22T01:36:39  <bhasker> have to fix that
2011-11-22T01:36:57  <bhasker> but first trying to get it to explore properly right now my exploration code is broken as hell
2011-11-22T01:40:39  <antimatroid> bhasker; what are you doing for exploration?

2011-11-22T01:41:50  <bhasker> basically i pick a random direction and move in that till i hit a wall then i do wall follow
2011-11-22T01:42:05  <bhasker> so each ant independently does a walk
2011-11-22T01:42:27  <bhasker> my older strategy was to move only when it increased vision
2011-11-22T01:42:32  <bhasker> which worked well in the previous ruleset
2011-11-22T01:42:38  <bhasker> but in this it just ends up blocking the hill
2011-11-22T01:42:42  <bhasker> and prevents ants from spawning

2011-11-22T01:45:06  <bhasker> yea just looking it up
2011-11-22T01:45:19  <bmh> it's probably a bad idea because we know how large the map is
2011-11-22T01:46:03  <bhasker> let me make that change makes sense no point going edge to edge
2011-11-22T01:46:06  <bmh> I once wrote a tiny tank AI that used a levy flight. Toward the end of the game bots couldn't find other bots to shoot, while my bot tended to find them and mop up. (other than that it was a rubbish bot and I stole my shooting controls from another bot)
2011-11-22T01:46:50  <bhasker> levy flight seems a bit too complicated to implement at the moment
2011-11-22T01:47:06  <bhasker> but implementing a move when i know a wall will be hit should be easier
2011-11-22T01:47:14  <bmh> and more useful!
2011-11-22T01:47:22  <bhasker> yes
2011-11-22T01:47:33  <bmh> Levy Flight is really simple. The only magic is the distribution you're sampling from to get the segment lengths.
2011-11-22T01:48:28  <bhasker> yea will look into that next, let me see how much of an improvement i can get with simple fixes first
2011-11-22T01:48:42  <bhasker> i anyway think i might have to rewrite this bot, since i had written it for the previous ruleset
2011-11-22T01:48:48  <bmh> That's smart :)
2011-11-22T01:48:48  <bhasker> and it has too many baked in assumptions
2011-11-22T01:49:20  <bhasker> though i really need to get out of this if then else habit of coding bots
2011-11-22T01:49:24  <bmh> My bot doesn't even work!

2011-11-22T01:55:23  <antimatroid> bhasker: yeah i just started a bot pretty much from scratch the other day
2011-11-22T01:55:42  <antimatroid> i basically stripped my beta bot down to having no strategy and built up from there
2011-11-22T01:55:50  <bhasker> yea will have to do something like that
2011-11-22T01:56:01  <bhasker> most of my state stuff is things i can reuse
2011-11-22T01:56:06  <bhasker> and battle code can be reused too
2011-11-22T01:56:19  <antimatroid> i didn't  have battle code before
2011-11-22T01:56:23  <antimatroid> did that over the weekend
2011-11-22T01:56:25  <bhasker> since i didn't take into account the food in battle in my older code
2011-11-22T01:56:32  <bhasker> so that doesn't change
2011-11-22T01:56:44  <bhasker> its mostly the exploration code which needs a better strategy
2011-11-22T01:56:59  <bhasker> and need to add defense code for hills and attack code for enemy hills
2011-11-22T01:57:06  <bhasker> also need to add some path caching
2011-11-22T01:57:11  <bhasker> into my a*
2011-11-22T01:57:19  <bhasker> so that i can reuse partial path generations
2011-11-22T01:57:27  <bhasker> and not rebuild complete paths everytime
2011-11-22T01:57:56  <antimatroid> i was going to store moves between turns but the random tie break rule for hills ruined that plan
2011-11-22T01:57:58  <antimatroid> it was just too messy
2011-11-22T01:58:01  <bhasker> esp like when routing alls pare ants to some enemyHill
2011-11-22T01:58:16  <bhasker> instead of generating all paths over and over again
2011-11-22T01:58:23  <bhasker> a lot of ants will have a common path after a point
2011-11-22T01:58:33  <bhasker> so closer ants paths can be reused
2011-11-22T01:58:39  <bhasker> for longer paths
2011-11-22T01:58:50  <bhasker> instead of recalculating all of it
2011-11-22T01:59:00  <bhasker> but my code is not structured that way right now to make use of cached paths
2011-11-22T01:59:04  <bhasker> will have to rewrite a lot of it

2011-11-22T02:36:52  <antimatroid> McLeopold: anything else?
2011-11-22T02:38:04  <antimatroid> multi source is easy, just add all ants to the search queue when you start searching
2011-11-22T02:38:26  <McLeopold> ?
2011-11-22T02:38:37  *** cyphase <cyphase!~cyphase@unaffiliated/cyphase> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-22T02:38:54  <antimatroid> hdist is your heuristic function for a location x, it gives the best case min path length to a target location
2011-11-22T02:39:16  <McLeopold> so, multiple sources and multiple targets?
2011-11-22T02:39:20  <antimatroid> yep
2011-11-22T02:39:57  <antimatroid> say i'm collecting food, i'll add all movable ants to a search queue, with g = turn the ant is available to move (=0 unless the ant has already been "moved")
2011-11-22T02:39:59  <McLeopold> at once?
2011-11-22T02:40:09  <antimatroid> yeah all simultaneously
2011-11-22T02:40:17  <antimatroid> then f = g + h
2011-11-22T02:40:25  <antimatroid> and the priority queue orders by f
2011-11-22T02:40:31  <antimatroid> and i think i break the tie with h
2011-11-22T02:40:39  <McLeopold> okay, I get a* with 1 source and 1 dest
2011-11-22T02:40:55  <antimatroid> okay, a* with n sources is almost the same
2011-11-22T02:41:03  <antimatroid> just add all source locations to your search queue at the start
2011-11-22T02:41:04  <antimatroid> with me?
2011-11-22T02:41:11  <McLeopold> no...
2011-11-22T02:41:30  <McLeopold> I understand what you are saying to do, I don't get how it works...
2011-11-22T02:41:42  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Description
2011-11-22T02:41:50  <antimatroid> i think based on that definition
2011-11-22T02:42:05  <antimatroid> for 1 target you have h(x) = manhatten distance (x, target)
2011-11-22T02:42:13  <antimatroid> i just make h(x) the minimum of those distances
2011-11-22T02:42:29  <McLeopold> so, do you just get 1 source to dest output?
2011-11-22T02:42:43  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-22T02:42:47  <McLeopold> ah
2011-11-22T02:42:54  <antimatroid> you find a minimum path from one of the sources to one of the targets
2011-11-22T02:43:12  <antimatroid> then when i collect food i'll iteratively collect uncollected food
2011-11-22T02:43:32  <McLeopold> and start over for each food?
2011-11-22T02:44:08  <antimatroid> you can also get information about how many turns untill say a square could be in the battle range of an enemy and use such information while pathfinding with your g(x) values
2011-11-22T02:44:17  <antimatroid> yeah i start the search again for each food item
2011-11-22T02:44:31  <McLeopold> it seems that any open node that was headed to a food node that got picked by a different source would need to be thrown out
2011-11-22T02:44:43  <antimatroid> what?
2011-11-22T02:44:55  <McLeopold> okay, I need an example...
2011-11-22T02:45:53  <antimatroid> i think it's also worth sometimes treating your other ants like water when pathfinding
2011-11-22T02:46:09  <antimatroid> that should do a poor job of diverting ants around battles to come in from other directions
2011-11-22T02:46:13  <McLeopold> maybe, but I'm solving a problem for map generations :)
2011-11-22T02:46:26  <antimatroid> ahhh, just use bfs?
2011-11-22T02:46:34  <McLeopold> maybe, but I wanted to check
2011-11-22T02:46:41  <antimatroid> i'm not really sure that this a* is any faster than bfs
2011-11-22T02:46:46  <antimatroid> but it's cooler so i'm using it anyway :P
2011-11-22T02:46:58  <McLeopold> http://paste.aichallenge.org/KtWMl/
2011-11-22T02:47:12  <antimatroid> the problem comes in with calculating the heuristic distance, if you have lots of targets then it might be quite slow i think
2011-11-22T02:47:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many hills
2011-11-22T02:47:38  <McLeopold> so, in that map, every ant/hill is a potential candidate for an actual hill, I want a matrix of distances
2011-11-22T02:47:41  <antimatroid> awesome otherwise
2011-11-22T02:47:47  <antimatroid> ahhh okay
2011-11-22T02:48:14  <McLeopold> I can bfs from each hill until I cover the map.
2011-11-22T02:48:23  <McLeopold> I was wondering if there was a better way
2011-11-22T02:48:26  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-22T02:48:29  <antimatroid> i'll think about it
2011-11-22T02:48:36  <antimatroid> i would probably just do the bfs from each hill
2011-11-22T02:48:41  <antimatroid> that should still be quite fast
2011-11-22T02:49:14  <antimatroid> McLeopold: the matrix is going to be symmetric
2011-11-22T02:49:19  <McLeopold> I was thinking of writing a python coroutine to do it :)
2011-11-22T02:49:19  <antimatroid> you should be able to use that information?
2011-11-22T02:49:42  <McLeopold> yeah, so for each hill, I can remove it from the list for the next cycle
2011-11-22T02:50:12  <antimatroid> and you don't need to do the last cycle?
2011-11-22T02:50:16  <McLeopold> I guess the best case would be to use the furthest hill from the last cycle as the seed for the next
2011-11-22T02:50:39  <McLeopold> then you end up with the later cycles being near each other
2011-11-22T02:50:41  <antimatroid> have you written it up and seen how fast it is?
2011-11-22T02:50:45  <McLeopold> no
2011-11-22T02:50:47  <antimatroid> i can't imagine it's going to be much of a problem
2011-11-22T02:51:19  <antimatroid> what's the plan for picking hill locations?
2011-11-22T02:51:20  <McLeopold> but...coroutines :D
2011-11-22T02:51:42  <McLeopold> remove combos out of proper range

2011-11-22T02:51:54  <antimatroid> maximising the average path to other squares or something might put them further away from the central battle zones in mazes?
2011-11-22T02:52:25  <antimatroid> although variety there might be good
2011-11-22T02:52:31  <McLeopold> I need to enforce the 250 max hill-to-hill requirement
2011-11-22T02:52:41  <McLeopold> and the 100 min
2011-11-22T02:52:55  <McLeopold> and also proving if 250 and 100 make sense
2011-11-22T02:53:03  <antimatroid> yep
2011-11-22T02:53:07  <antimatroid> 100 is quite large?
2011-11-22T02:53:16  <McLeopold> yeah, that would probably need to be smaller
2011-11-22T02:53:22  <antimatroid> wont that almost make open maps unfeasible with similar dimensions?
2011-11-22T02:53:44  <McLeopold> not if they have enough barriers between the hills
2011-11-22T02:54:06  <antimatroid> shouldn't there be some maps that are almost entirely open?
2011-11-22T02:54:12  <McLeopold> yep
2011-11-22T02:54:24  <antimatroid> while i love the maze maps i agree on the need for variety
2011-11-22T02:54:27  <McLeopold> but we still want some type of min
2011-11-22T02:54:41  <antimatroid> i would put it somewhere like 30
2011-11-22T02:54:45  <antimatroid> and consider even reducing that
2011-11-22T02:54:48  <McLeopold> that sounds good
2011-11-22T02:55:00  <antimatroid> a1k0n probably has an opinion on that one :P
2011-11-22T02:55:23  <McLeopold> I think we had talked about view radius * 2 or 3
2011-11-22T02:56:19  <antimatroid> it's now 7ish yeah?
2011-11-22T02:56:29  <McLeopold> sqrt(77)
2011-11-22T02:56:45  <McLeopold> 8ish
2011-11-22T02:56:49  <antimatroid> yep
2011-11-22T02:57:04  <McLeopold> so, 24 makes sense to me
2011-11-22T02:57:19  <antimatroid> sure
2011-11-22T02:57:25  <McLeopold> the max distance needs to be coordinated with the cutoff rules
2011-11-22T02:57:46  <antimatroid> are you going to allow them to start in view of each other?
2011-11-22T02:57:55  <antimatroid> ie. the path between two in view could be greater than 24
2011-11-22T02:58:17  <McLeopold> yes, just the path, not actual distance
2011-11-22T02:58:42  <antimatroid> i think it might be nice to also say we'll ensure you can't see enemies hills and vice versa on the first turn?
2011-11-22T02:58:53  <McLeopold> but that's not true
2011-11-22T02:59:02  <antimatroid> but we could
2011-11-22T02:59:10  <antimatroid> just enfore a min starting euclidean distance
2011-11-22T02:59:16  <antimatroid> up until now that's probably already been the case
2011-11-22T02:59:28  <McLeopold> yeah, probably
2011-11-22T02:59:44  <antimatroid> i don't mind too much either way, but we should clarify whichever way we do go
2011-11-22T02:59:50  <antimatroid> because we haven't said anything about that
2011-11-22T03:00:22  <McLeopold> we didn't, I can add that to the map specs
2011-11-22T03:00:46  <McLeopold> can you easily add these checks to your multi-maze code?
2011-11-22T03:00:59  <antimatroid> which checks?
2011-11-22T03:01:04  <McLeopold> min/max hill dist
2011-11-22T03:01:18  <antimatroid> atm it has a min euclidean starting distance greater than view (pretty sure it's greater)
2011-11-22T03:01:25  <antimatroid> but it doesn't do anything about path lengths
2011-11-22T03:01:49  <McLeopold> after you generate a new hill location, you could do the bfs to ensure it is within range
2011-11-22T03:01:54  <rajanaresh> hey guys, how are people exploring. I mean how do you explore the map. I just need some buzz words i can look into.
2011-11-22T03:02:10  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: path finding
2011-11-22T03:02:20  <McLeopold> unseen squares and map coverage
2011-11-22T03:02:26  <rajanaresh> you mean like A*
2011-11-22T03:02:35  <antimatroid> breadth first search is easiest
2011-11-22T03:02:36  <McLeopold> I think the diffusion guys do good exploring as well
2011-11-22T03:02:37  <antimatroid> but i use a*
2011-11-22T03:02:50  <antimatroid> well not for exploration i don't, target set is too large
2011-11-22T03:03:59  <rajanaresh> I already do A* for food collection. But this is very specific. I have the target. Suppose I have a free ant. How do I let him explore?
2011-11-22T03:03:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think amstan has also been playing around with map stuff
2011-11-22T03:04:18  <McLeopold> he has, he's got some nice cell automation stuff
2011-11-22T03:04:24  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: bfs until you find something attractive like an enemy/not seen square etc.
2011-11-22T03:06:02  <antimatroid> i'm most interested in what people are doing for battle code

2011-11-22T04:46:53  <speakeasy> im not terribly good at python yet, i started learning it thismorning lol cos java was annnoying me so much, the wiki pages dont give me much insite, can you just give me a brief explanation that i can understand (not wiki style lol)
2011-11-22T04:53:34  <delt0r_> speakeasy: start at your "ant"
2011-11-22T04:54:56  <delt0r_> for each adjacent tile, check to see if you have visited it before. If you have not visited it before, add this to a FIFO que
2011-11-22T04:55:11  <delt0r_> get the next tile from the que...
2011-11-22T04:55:15  <delt0r_> rinse and repeat
2011-11-22T04:55:50  <speakeasy> how do you mean fifo>
2011-11-22T04:56:09  <speakeasy> first in first out?
2011-11-22T04:56:15  <speakeasy> sorry im a bit of a noob
2011-11-22T04:56:47  <delt0r_> yea First in First out
2011-11-22T04:57:09  <delt0r_> a stack (FILO) will not work properly
2011-11-22T04:57:34  <delt0r_> well it will then be  a depth first search
2011-11-22T04:58:15  <delt0r_> speakeasy: you can't really go too far at once if you are starting programing. probably want to get the hang of basic loops and data structures first...
2011-11-22T04:58:21  <delt0r_> then try a BFS

2011-11-22T05:00:59  <delt0r_> Linked lists are the typical method of having a fast FIFO or a ring buffer for a bounded size one

2011-11-22T05:02:55  <delt0r_> details come with understanding... understanding comes from getting something working... IMO anyways
2011-11-22T05:03:20  <speakeasy> and the irony is that to get something working you need understanding
2011-11-22T05:03:33  <delt0r_> not as much as you think at the start...
2011-11-22T05:03:45  <delt0r_> just avoid too many details.. keep things simple
2011-11-22T05:03:58  <mcstar> coffee is brewing
2011-11-22T05:04:02  <mcstar> thats important
2011-11-22T05:04:02  <delt0r_> once you have something working ... or not... try to understand why

2011-11-22T06:47:12  <Garf> indexing a list is slightly faster, but can only be done by a numeric index

2011-11-22T06:48:27  <speakeasy> ?
2011-11-22T06:48:43  <Garf> mcstar: imho, thats purely a personal design decision
2011-11-22T06:48:56  <mcstar> imho it isnt

2011-11-22T06:50:11  <mcstar> Garf: why did you say: so you can never actually see the battle positions
2011-11-22T06:50:13  <Garf> you can use a 1d list, indexed by r*MAX_COLUMNS+row
2011-11-22T06:50:25  <Garf> you can use a hash, indexed by location, and set water locations = true
2011-11-22T06:50:34  <Garf> or you can use a list of lists (2d array)
2011-11-22T06:50:57  <Garf> or you can use a list of locations
2011-11-22T06:51:14  <Garf> mcstar: you can't see the actual positions of the ants when they battle
2011-11-22T06:51:23  <mcstar> of course you can
2011-11-22T06:52:26  <Garf> how?
2011-11-22T06:52:44  <mcstar> i alredy told you
2011-11-22T06:52:46  <mcstar> a*
2011-11-22T06:52:57  <mcstar> with the |< and >| buttons
2011-11-22T06:53:26  <mcstar> if you single-step the visualization you can see everything
2011-11-22T06:55:22  <mcstar> and why did you leave numpy arrays out?
2011-11-22T06:55:33  <mcstar> i really dont want to nitpick but that is a trivial alternative
2011-11-22T06:56:41  <Garf> because its an extension :P
2011-11-22T06:57:11  <Garf> also, functionalitywise its identical to a list of lists, prolly just more memory-efficient
2011-11-22T06:57:35  <mcstar> Garf: the problem is with types
2011-11-22T06:57:42  <mcstar> a list can hold anything
2011-11-22T06:57:50  <mcstar> a numpy array is typed
2011-11-22T06:58:04  <Garf> yes, so its more memory efficient, and maye save you some unboxing
2011-11-22T06:58:21  <mcstar> the speed of unboxing is what matters not the memory
2011-11-22T06:58:29  <Garf> not sure if Pypy does type inference
2011-11-22T06:58:31  <speakeasy> is the top left corner (0, 0)
2011-11-22T06:58:34  <speakeasy> ?
2011-11-22T06:58:43  <mcstar> yes

2011-11-22T07:03:43  <pairofdice> Not that the ants care about map orientation
2011-11-22T07:04:19  <mcstar> but you can get confused, when taking care of wrapping etc.
2011-11-22T07:04:58  <mcstar> i had a bug once, the ant couldnt pass the border of the map
2011-11-22T07:05:11  <mcstar> poor thing was bouncing off of it
2011-11-22T07:07:32  <speakeasy2> hi, does this make sense:         #find land
2011-11-22T07:07:32  <speakeasy2>         for landloc in ants.passable():
2011-11-22T07:07:32  <speakeasy2>             if landloc not in self.land:
2011-11-22T07:07:32  <speakeasy2>                 self.land.append(landloc)

2011-11-22T07:08:24  <pairofdice> Ummm, no
2011-11-22T07:08:29  <speakeasy2> oh
2011-11-22T07:08:33  <pairofdice> ants.passable returns true/false
2011-11-22T07:08:51  <mcstar> isnt that ispassable?
2011-11-22T07:09:23  <speakeasy2>     def passable(self, loc):

2011-11-22T07:09:34  <speakeasy2> thats the part in the ant.py
2011-11-22T07:09:49  <mcstar> well its a bool than
2011-11-22T07:10:14  <speakeasy2> is a bool like a boolean?
2011-11-22T07:10:33  <mcstar> yes?
2011-11-22T07:11:38  <mcstar> what is the smiley of one eyebrow raised?
2011-11-22T07:11:42  <mcstar> and looking curious?
2011-11-22T07:12:37  <speakeasy2> so if i want to get a map of land locations how would i do this?
2011-11-22T07:13:19  <mcstar> whats wrong with self.map?
2011-11-22T07:13:26  <mcstar> that already has land
2011-11-22T07:13:57  <mcstar> are you speakeasy?
2011-11-22T07:14:46  <speakeasy2> yes
2011-11-22T07:14:57  <speakeasy2> on my laptop
2011-11-22T07:15:15  <speakeasy2> will self.map return everything or just land without water?
2011-11-22T07:15:38  <mcstar> seek for the definition of WATER
2011-11-22T07:15:48  <mcstar> you will find other kinds as well i think
2011-11-22T07:15:59  <mcstar> but i have no idea, and pairofdice is lazy to answer
2011-11-22T07:16:26  <speakeasy2> sorry if im being a bit of a pain
2011-11-22T07:16:50  <mcstar> youre not a pain, but you should read your bot before you start modding it

2011-11-22T08:03:13  <antimatroid> i hope it's going to run alright
2011-11-22T08:03:15  <antimatroid> i think it should

2011-11-22T08:05:24  <contestbot> mcstar: User error, it's not my fault.
2011-11-22T08:05:53  <mcstar> i see how that can be confusing for a newbie
2011-11-22T08:06:28  <antimatroid> what can?
2011-11-22T08:06:42  <mcstar> wll, run() is a  @staticmethod
2011-11-22T08:06:54  <mcstar> it is not a class member, i.e. not Ants's member
2011-11-22T08:07:04  <mcstar> but you still call it from main like: Ants.run()
2011-11-22T08:07:20  <mcstar> i dont see whats the point
2011-11-22T08:07:40  <mcstar> maybe has something to do with member variable access
2011-11-22T08:07:42  <mcstar> idk
2011-11-22T08:07:55  <speakeasy2> is it appened or append, my spelling fails
2011-11-22T08:08:02  <mcstar> append
2011-11-22T08:08:06  <speakeasy2> cheers
2011-11-22T08:09:41  <speakeasy2> is it possible to do for all directions?

2011-11-22T08:11:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: collaboration with each other
2011-11-22T08:12:15  <mcstar> for my own ants to colaborate
2011-11-22T08:12:43  <mcstar> or you might call it ant-formations whatever
2011-11-22T08:13:07  <antimatroid> for battles?
2011-11-22T08:13:22  <antimatroid> mine ought to do that with my battle code naturally
2011-11-22T08:13:32  <mcstar> antimatroid: really?
2011-11-22T08:13:37  <mcstar> from long distance?
2011-11-22T08:13:45  <mcstar> this is pre-battle colaboration
2011-11-22T08:13:48  <mcstar> l
2011-11-22T08:14:05  <antimatroid> oh no, they will collaborate in the battle situation
2011-11-22T08:14:15  <antimatroid> the rest is me correctly using ants
2011-11-22T08:14:23  <mcstar> im writing code so that they can chase an enemy togther
2011-11-22T08:14:23  <antimatroid> ie. funnelling enough ants into battles
2011-11-22T08:14:33  <mcstar> and when possible ill call the kill shot
2011-11-22T08:14:48  <antimatroid> mine will do the kill shots when possible
2011-11-22T08:15:09  <antimatroid> it literally does the minimax thing on partitions of all ants that can land in a battle next turn
2011-11-22T08:15:15  <mcstar> antimatroid: it is a physical impossibility to do it when it isnt possible
2011-11-22T08:15:36  <mcstar> ok
2011-11-22T08:15:43  <mcstar> but i dont want to wait for those to happen
2011-11-22T08:15:53  <mcstar> i want my ants to create proper battle situations

2011-11-22T09:24:07  <antimatroid> does "before" imply the ordering of events by time?
2011-11-22T09:24:16  <antimatroid> ie. does it make sense to talk about something existing before time existed?
2011-11-22T09:24:27  <pairofdice> Yes and no
2011-11-22T09:24:53  <antimatroid> why?
2011-11-22T09:25:35  <mcstar> depends on the theory
2011-11-22T09:26:15  <mcstar> if time was created in the instant of creation, but there are other spaces and times, then it is correct to speak of before
2011-11-22T09:26:17  <mcstar> i think
2011-11-22T09:26:33  <mcstar> because a sort of causality can connect multiple time-lines
2011-11-22T09:26:42  <mcstar> no?

2011-11-22T09:29:47  <mcstar> because of relativity
2011-11-22T09:30:37  <mcstar> i mean spec.rel. shows you that simultainity is relative to the observer
2011-11-22T09:31:00  <mcstar> so what is before for one observer can be after for another
2011-11-22T09:31:35  <mcstar> im just gald that space/time is close to euclidean where i live

2011-11-22T12:01:11  <praveen> mcstar: it doesnt know about enemy ants right now, I will add that first
2011-11-22T12:01:18  <mcstar> k
2011-11-22T12:02:14  <praveen> mcstar: I feel for the most efficient food collection in the beginning stages, maximum matching in bipartite graph is best. But feel dont need to go to that level. anybody doing this?
2011-11-22T12:02:33  <mcstar> i did in my common lisp bot
2011-11-22T12:02:58  <mcstar> but its totally unncessary if you have a good override
2011-11-22T12:03:02  <praveen> Oh, How good was it?
2011-11-22T12:03:08  <mcstar> very good
2011-11-22T12:03:26  <mcstar> but not better on average than this one
2011-11-22T12:03:39  <praveen> You are using that now in your bots?
2011-11-22T12:03:45  <mcstar> no
2011-11-22T12:03:50  <mcstar> thats what im saying
2011-11-22T12:03:54  <mcstar> it isnt necessary
2011-11-22T12:04:30  <mcstar> in the beginnig you have food collection + exploration
2011-11-22T12:04:58  <mcstar> and i think the imperfection that my alg. or other non-perfect alg. bring in, it makes up for that in exploration
2011-11-22T12:05:12  <praveen> Yeah true
2011-11-22T12:05:54  <praveen> the reason for not creating defensive strategy is, right now am experimenting exploration. If
2011-11-22T12:06:03  <praveen> sorry- ignore the prev comment
2011-11-22T12:07:09  <praveen> I can understand whether my exploration is good, only if it does the exploration part alone. If I do exploration + some defense, I could not figure out which one is going wrong. Anyways I feel I need to add this to make some progress
2011-11-22T12:07:47  <mcstar> better bots will hunt your lone ants down
2011-11-22T12:07:55  <mcstar> wo any kind of defense easily
2011-11-22T12:08:07  <mcstar> if you try to avoid them, you gain a bit of time
2011-11-22T12:08:18  <mcstar> until you hit water, and you will die then
2011-11-22T12:08:30  <praveen> mcstar: Yeah exactly the same happening. Thats why I wanted to play with bots of my level.
2011-11-22T12:09:04  <mcstar> i suggest you maximize exploration + food collection by playing against your bot
2011-11-22T12:09:04  <praveen> mcstar: Will get coding. Thanks for the pointers
2011-11-22T12:09:08  <mcstar> in a very defensive mode
2011-11-22T12:09:29  <praveen> yeah ok
2011-11-22T12:09:40  <mcstar> if you can beat your defensive bot with the new one every time (i.e. can collect overwhelmingly more food) you can stop
2011-11-22T12:12:39  <BenJackson> morning
2011-11-22T12:12:48  <mcstar> hardly
2011-11-22T12:12:55  <Surya> Hey guys, since you're talking about strategy, I'd like to have an analyse from someone further than I. I've made a "correct" IA which explores well attack hills & rush food. Now I have the (huge) issue of close fight (because I basically lose every single ant against wall of ants)
2011-11-22T12:13:10  <mcstar> ia?
2011-11-22T12:13:14  <mcstar> internal affairs?
2011-11-22T12:13:21  <pairofdice> Infernal Ants
2011-11-22T12:13:22  <Surya> sorry french there :p
2011-11-22T12:13:22  <Surya> ai
2011-11-22T12:13:24  <mcstar> Surya: you need an ai
2011-11-22T12:13:26  <Surya> héh :)
2011-11-22T12:13:53  <pairofdice> I'm not going to tell you how to beat my bot :)
2011-11-22T12:14:00  <mcstar> same here
2011-11-22T12:14:04  <Surya> anyway, the first step i have in mind is to back off my ants if the situation is bad.
2011-11-22T12:14:09  <mcstar> Surya: but goo luck
2011-11-22T12:14:13  <mcstar> d
2011-11-22T12:14:20  <Surya> But i have no idea for attacking
2011-11-22T12:14:21  <mcstar> thats excellent
2011-11-22T12:14:29  <Surya> My question is this one : (wait for it :))
2011-11-22T12:14:31  <mcstar> thats what i suggested to praveen
2011-11-22T12:14:56  <Surya> How hard is it? Compared to the rest? Is it like 10 times harder? I'm thinking of a minimax for every dangerous area
2011-11-22T12:15:00  <Surya> but i will timeout
2011-11-22T12:15:09  <pairofdice> Basic combat is pretty easy
2011-11-22T12:15:11  <Surya> I know it
2011-11-22T12:15:33  <pairofdice> minimax is a bad idea

2011-11-22T12:15:46  <Surya> ok
2011-11-22T12:15:56  <Surya> What do you call "basic combat"?
2011-11-22T12:16:02  <Surya> I'd like to stop losing all my ants 1vs10
2011-11-22T12:16:13  <mcstar> thats easy
2011-11-22T12:16:18  <mcstar> avoid them
2011-11-22T12:16:23  <pairofdice> If your ants are outnumbered, fall back, else close in
2011-11-22T12:16:34  <pairofdice> basic.
2011-11-22T12:16:42  <mcstar> visual.
2011-11-22T12:16:47  <Surya> lol :)
2011-11-22T12:17:08  <Surya> Ok, i'll do my best
2011-11-22T12:17:14  <Surya> Thanks for your answers :)
2011-11-22T12:18:44  <mcstar> Surya: the minimax approach is not a good way, but there are things resembling it
2011-11-22T12:18:48  <BenJackson> if all my games went this well I'd be #1!  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=114769&user=3473
2011-11-22T12:19:04  <mcstar> you can try that, and see where do you need to change what, and what restrictions apply
2011-11-22T12:19:50  <mcstar> BenJackson: nice, but you need to spread those ants
2011-11-22T12:19:54  <BenJackson> Surya: fwiw the combat in my bot there (white) is pretty basic

2011-11-22T14:14:26  <ThatSnail> Print() doesn't work
2011-11-22T14:14:59  <Minthos> you need to write to stderr and configure playgame.py to print stderr output from the bot

2011-11-22T14:51:34  <mcstar> us something
2011-11-22T14:52:30  <mcstar> amstan probably attends the uni of waterloo
2011-11-22T14:52:36  <Fluxid> does anyone know: 1. can i upload compiled c extension for python 2. what arch is used, amd64 or x86?
2011-11-22T14:52:40  <mcstar> i guess, so its us western time?
2011-11-22T14:52:55  <BenJackson> Fluxid: I don't think so
2011-11-22T14:53:02  <mcstar> why not?
2011-11-22T14:53:09  <BenJackson> oh, you mean YOU'd compile
2011-11-22T14:53:09  <mcstar> you can
2011-11-22T14:53:12  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-22T14:53:13  <Fluxid> i remember someone said i can, but i wanted to make sure
2011-11-22T14:53:15  <BenJackson> and put the .so
2011-11-22T14:53:19  <Fluxid> BenJackson: yeah, .so
2011-11-22T14:53:24  <BenJackson> in that case build for both :)
2011-11-22T14:53:30  <Fluxid> i thought of that
2011-11-22T14:53:37  <BenJackson> alternatively convert your bot to C or C++
2011-11-22T14:53:49  <BenJackson> have MyBot.cc exec python on whatever.py
2011-11-22T14:53:57  <mcstar> Fluxid: speed problems at last?
2011-11-22T14:54:03  <Fluxid> BenJackson: nah, too much work. i just want time critical part to be rewriten in C (i already have some C code)
2011-11-22T14:54:09  <BenJackson> well, I guess that way you can't exec python, you'd have to start an interpreter
2011-11-22T14:54:20  <BenJackson> Fluxid: I don't mean change your code
2011-11-22T14:54:31  <BenJackson> I mean change your language so the build would compile your C extensino
2011-11-22T14:54:37  <BenJackson> and then your C would actually run your python bot
2011-11-22T14:55:03  <mcstar> BenJackson: how?
2011-11-22T14:55:08  <mcstar> thats another process
2011-11-22T14:55:10  <Fluxid> BenJackson: wow, i did once python embedding, but... that would be too much work now
2011-11-22T14:55:16  <mcstar> i think the engine would kill it
2011-11-22T14:55:28  <BenJackson> exec replaces
2011-11-22T14:55:29  <BenJackson> hang on
2011-11-22T14:55:34  <Fluxid> mcstar: no, this would embed python interpreter in C binary
2011-11-22T14:55:41  <BenJackson> http://docs.python.org/extending/embedding.html
2011-11-22T14:55:41  <Fluxid> that would be still one process
2011-11-22T14:55:43  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-22T14:55:44  <Fluxid> yup
2011-11-22T14:56:01  <BenJackson> there's an example, even
2011-11-22T14:56:05  <mcstar> but isnt that large or something?

2011-11-22T15:04:33  <mcstar> Fluxid: why are you asking?
2011-11-22T15:05:17  <Fluxid> no idea, this question mark just really wanted to be there
2011-11-22T15:05:50  <BenJackson> What's so special about pypy&
2011-11-22T15:06:27  <mcstar> cause its pure python? and fast?(heard)
2011-11-22T15:06:36  <Fluxid> BenJackson: if code is well written, it can get over 4.7x faster
2011-11-22T15:06:43  <BenJackson> nice
2011-11-22T15:06:56  <Fluxid> it's good for number-crunching
2011-11-22T15:07:23  <BenJackson> I wrote a JIT for a language once which made things like number crunching much faster
2011-11-22T15:07:31  <mcstar> i guess its mentally pleasing that it stands on its own?
2011-11-22T15:07:32  <BenJackson> then I realized most of what people did in that language was concatenate strings
2011-11-22T15:07:41  <BenJackson> which got very little benefit
2011-11-22T15:07:49  <Fluxid> but JIT needs warmup, at the beginning it can be few times slower :P
2011-11-22T15:08:13  <Fluxid> BenJackson: pypy actually isn't just python, but interpreter+jit framework, you can implement other languages in it
2011-11-22T15:09:23  <BenJackson> the holograms on my new DIscover card are cool

2011-11-22T19:11:59  <mcstar> do i have to provide bots for all players?
2011-11-22T19:12:08  <mcstar> or are there static ants?

2011-11-22T19:14:46  <mcstar> not letters

2011-11-22T19:15:44  <thestinger> 0 -> A etc.

2011-11-22T19:19:00  <thestinger> why?
2011-11-22T19:19:00  <mcstar> i cant call playgame.py from the current directory
2011-11-22T19:19:16  <mcstar> it needs to be called where it is, cause needs the other files
2011-11-22T19:19:19  <mcstar> from*
2011-11-22T19:20:12  <mcstar> i think im gonna need to add that dir to the python path
2011-11-22T19:20:28  <thestinger> are you sure?
2011-11-22T19:20:33  <thestinger> calling it from a different directory works for me

2011-11-22T19:20:40  <mcstar> really?
2011-11-22T19:20:54  <thestinger> but the bots need to be in the directory I call it from or the sandboxing stuff freaks out
2011-11-22T19:21:05  <mcstar> ../playgame.py complains that it doesnt see the engine
2011-11-22T19:22:26  <mcstar> thestinger: i think engine.py is in the directory you are calling playgame from
2011-11-22T19:22:32  <thestinger> no
2011-11-22T19:22:44  <thestinger> 'tools' is in the directory
2011-11-22T19:22:52  <thestinger> look at the command I pasted
2011-11-22T19:23:00  <mcstar> im not crazy
2011-11-22T19:23:11  <thestinger> neither am I :P
2011-11-22T19:23:19  <thestinger> maybe it doesn't work if you're deeper in the directory tree
2011-11-22T19:23:22  <thestinger> but I'm higher up
2011-11-22T19:23:23  <mcstar> i cant call playgame.py from anywhere else except from where it is
2011-11-22T19:23:31  <mcstar> tried that
2011-11-22T19:23:37  <mcstar> ants/playgame.py same error
2011-11-22T19:23:49  <thestinger> did you try 'python2 ants/playgame.py'?
2011-11-22T19:23:55  <mcstar> why?
2011-11-22T19:24:02  <mcstar> it calls python2
2011-11-22T19:24:02  <thestinger> dunno, for some reason I'm doing it that way

2011-11-22T19:51:09  <mcstar> and i cant just disable symmetry checks, the whole thing breaks down
2011-11-22T19:51:15  <mcstar> not that it shouldnt
2011-11-22T19:51:32  <mcstar> but either im missing something or this is useless

2011-11-22T19:59:36  <avdg> hmm, I wonder if a vector of object (and not of pointers) is a bad idea in c++ (until I overlook something)
2011-11-22T19:59:57  <mcstar> no
2011-11-22T20:00:03  <mcstar> even better in c++11

2011-11-22T20:00:16  <mcstar> i read up on this, and its totally ok to return anything

2011-11-22T20:02:27  * avdg looks at header file
2011-11-22T20:02:52  <mcstar> if the elements are references you could do *new

2011-11-22T20:14:00  <thestinger> use vec.emplace_back(row, col)

2011-11-22T20:14:34  <thestinger> it guarantees that it doesn't construct it then copy it

2011-11-22T20:14:58  <mcstar> no?
2011-11-22T20:15:12  <thestinger> .emplace_back() passes the arguments to the constructor
2011-11-22T20:15:28  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-22T20:15:40  <thestinger> .push_back() will make a copy (usually)

2011-11-22T20:25:01  <thestinger> I have too, so learning C++ was easy
2011-11-22T20:25:09  <thestinger> it's just the weird subtle things that are tricky
2011-11-22T20:25:28  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-22T20:25:36  <mcstar> and im teaching my friend too
2011-11-22T20:25:44  <mcstar> he was brand new to programming
2011-11-22T20:25:56  <thestinger> nice
2011-11-22T20:26:04  <mcstar> he figure he needed some actual knowledge, since he put that into his cv

2011-11-22T20:26:39  <analyst74> good work, thestinger, http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.11208
2011-11-22T20:26:59  <thestinger> analyst74: thanks :)
2011-11-22T20:27:07  <avdg> oh well, I just have to find out a way to fix my wrong assumptions with c++, but otherwise, yeah, c++ is quite simple
2011-11-22T20:27:23  <avdg> at least, if I don't look at the problems of c++
2011-11-22T20:28:14  <mcstar> i just read today about namespace pitfalls
2011-11-22T20:28:28  <thestinger> argument dependent name resolution, etc.?
2011-11-22T20:28:50  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-22T20:29:05  <mcstar> adl
2011-11-22T20:29:14  <mcstar> argument dependent lookup?
2011-11-22T20:29:25  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-22T20:29:46  <thestinger> that's one of the causes of the horrible compiler errors
2011-11-22T20:30:04  <mcstar> i believe you sensei
2011-11-22T20:30:16  <thestinger> and the way C++ does overloading leads to those horrible errors
2011-11-22T20:30:28  <thestinger> it just keeps looking for a working overload
2011-11-22T20:31:05  <thestinger> clang has much saner errors but it doesn't compile my code anymore since the C++11 support is way behind gcc

2011-11-22T20:32:13  <thestinger> well, I think if I install the 3.0 release candidate it might be able to compile it again
2011-11-22T20:32:38  <thestinger> 2.9 can't handle std::unordered_map, std::array, std::unordered_set, etc.
2011-11-22T20:33:04  <mcstar> why bother?
2011-11-22T20:33:25  <thestinger> well, I use it for autocompletion in vim
2011-11-22T20:33:44  <mcstar> well, kdevelop deep-parses my code
2011-11-22T20:33:48  <thestinger> and it has really nice errors/warnings and static analysis
2011-11-22T20:33:55  <mcstar> it lets me know about everyhting
2011-11-22T20:33:58  <thestinger> the g++ errors are ridiculous sometimes
2011-11-22T20:34:40  <mcstar> well, i compile often, so i always now where the error is
2011-11-22T20:35:00  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-22T20:35:02  <mcstar> and i usually find it quickly except when im really tired
2011-11-22T20:35:34  <thestinger> the ridiculous errors have just annoyed me after merging in a branch
2011-11-22T20:35:52  <thestinger> because it's tricky to figure out what the hell is wrong when I didn't just code it
2011-11-22T20:36:24  <mcstar> what is your main language?
2011-11-22T20:36:30  <mcstar> are you a progessional?
2011-11-22T20:36:32  <mcstar> f
2011-11-22T20:36:44  <thestinger> no, not yet (I'm 19)
2011-11-22T20:36:53  <thestinger> python is the language I know really well

2011-11-22T20:42:00  <Conorach> I know that feeling
2011-11-22T20:42:26  <Conorach> should turn in myself :/
2011-11-22T20:42:37  <Conorach> good examples :)
2011-11-22T20:42:51  <amstan_> i hate that feeling
2011-11-22T20:42:58  <amstan_> it's like when you see the sun, game over
2011-11-22T20:43:02  <amstan_> no point in sleeping anymore
2011-11-22T20:43:13  <Conorach> haha
2011-11-22T20:43:24  <Conorach> yeah when the sky turns lighter in the distance you already know you're in for a rough day ;)
2011-11-22T20:43:36  <Conorach> although I can normally still catch a few hours of sleep at that point.
