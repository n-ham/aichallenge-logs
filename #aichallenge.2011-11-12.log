2011-11-12T02:21:29  <nickjohnson> MiltonBradley: What happens when you just run it?
2011-11-12T02:22:06  <pairofdice> I love it how my ants steal that green hill from the middle of their group
2011-11-12T02:22:45  <MiltonBradley> I double click on it and a black cmd window pops up then disappears in a split second
2011-11-12T02:23:17  <nickjohnson> Try running it from the command line
2011-11-12T02:23:31  <MiltonBradley> how do I do that?
2011-11-12T02:23:48  <MiltonBradley> I opened the command line. I'm a little embarassed. Never done this before... Sorry
2011-11-12T02:24:01  <nickjohnson> Basic command line tutorials are a bit out of scope for this channel, I think :)

2011-11-12T02:26:10  <nickjohnson> Bear in mind that play_one_game is just a demo script
2011-11-12T02:26:24  <nickjohnson> Try entering what it contains yourself, replacing 'python' with the path to your python interpreter
2011-11-12T02:26:43  <MiltonBradley> ok I open it in a text file?
2011-11-12T02:26:55  <nickjohnson> You could modify it, yes
2011-11-12T02:27:03  <nickjohnson> You could also just type what it contains straight into the command line window

2011-11-12T02:37:53  <nickjohnson> You're probably better off adding c:\python27 to your path, since it's referred to elsewhere in that command line too

2011-11-12T02:41:15  <nickjohnson> Add c:\python27 to your path. I'm sure Google has lots of resources on how to do that :)
2011-11-12T02:41:24  <MiltonBradley> to what path

2011-11-12T02:43:00  <MiltonBradley> thanks for your help btw
2011-11-12T02:45:16  <pairofdice> But if it's not in your path, you can reference it directly
2011-11-12T02:52:15  <MiltonBradley> Ok how do I reference it directly? Type it enclosed in "'s such as "C:\python27\python.exe"
2011-11-12T02:55:02  <pairofdice> No "'
2011-11-12T02:56:09  <nickjohnson> Adding it to the path is going to be by far the easiest option
2011-11-12T02:56:25  <nickjohnson> Typing the full path each time is going to be a pain
2011-11-12T03:01:09  <MiltonBradley> can't I type the full path once in the cmd line file or something

2011-11-12T04:51:38  <Fulairyn> I tried to not let the ants bang into eachother, and checked it by this: If a.Passable(newloc) and a.Unoccupied(newloc)
2011-11-12T04:51:56  <Fulairyn> unfortunately, this doesn't work. Am I doing something wrong ?
2011-11-12T04:54:29  <matthewd> Fulairyn: "doesn't work"?
2011-11-12T04:55:26  <Fulairyn> well, they still walk into echother ;), so it works, but doesn't do what I want :(
2011-11-12T04:57:15  <Fulairyn> And now i'm a little confused, I thought it would be simple to start in vb, and I saw the function a.unoccupied and a.passable and I thought, with those two I can check if I can move to that spot. I saw other people doing it whit that to, but in c# or something
2011-11-12T04:57:46  <ProperChaos> you also need to check if two ants aren't getting the same order-destination
2011-11-12T04:59:05  <pairofdice> You don't care about where the ants are but where they are going
2011-11-12T04:59:05  <Fulairyn> offcourse!, cause they check if it's free there, and it is free, but there are 2 ants going to the same destination at the same time. Thanks!

2011-11-12T07:22:27  <okan009> maybe , i have a problem with searching around for food , specially north and south , i write with that starter package , i think i am misunderstod that code , because i am looking for west and east of ant correctly

2011-11-12T07:37:35  <Flapadar> Cheese mleise
2011-11-12T07:37:50  <Flapadar> I'll probably just have to re-write the parser to insert hills into the structs.
2011-11-12T07:39:35  <mleise> okan009: isn't all food in some 'food list' ?
2011-11-12T07:40:31  <mleise> pick one ant and one food item and move the ant in the right direction for starters ^^
2011-11-12T07:40:43  <okan009> mm i guess no , i have a map matrix , and i'm searching in ant's range
2011-11-12T07:40:56  <Flapadar> Are you searching row,col 8 by 8?
2011-11-12T07:41:11  <Flapadar> You basically have to loop 64 times (two 1,8 loops) if you want to do it that way
2011-11-12T07:41:58  <Flapadar> for r = -8,8 do
2011-11-12T07:41:58  <Flapadar> 		for c = -8,8 do
2011-11-12T07:41:58  <Flapadar> 			local deltaR,deltaC = wrap(row+r,0,ants.config.rows),wrap(col+c,0,ants.config.cols)
2011-11-12T07:42:28  <Flapadar> My bad, much more than 64 lol
2011-11-12T07:42:53  <mleise> You shouldn't hard code these numbers!
2011-11-12T07:43:18  <Flapadar> there's a variable for the radius of line of sight of each ant?
2011-11-12T07:43:36  <pairofdice> ...how about you look at the website
2011-11-12T07:43:38  <mleise> yes, and you are supposed to use it :)
2011-11-12T07:44:12  <Flapadar> Hm, isn't in the lua starter nor is it parsed when it loads
2011-11-12T07:44:15  <Flapadar> Must have been added since?
2011-11-12T07:44:38  <mleise> In the last contest we started with 23 planets (I think) and people started hard-coding that number. Their bots crashed when we added 2 more planets. So we added game variables.

2011-11-12T07:45:23  <mleise> Flapadar: no, these variables were there practically from the start. complain with the author of the lua starter :)
2011-11-12T07:46:02  <Flapadar> Ah lol. Is there a place where I can read the input of io.stdin:lines() without running the bot?
2011-11-12T07:46:12  <Flapadar> So as I can rewrite the parser to use everything that's given etc
2011-11-12T07:46:26  <okan009> yes i am searching 8 to 8 square , and i am looking for distance of food , but i am searching differnt , i divided that square to corner to corner , 4 pieces , triangle , if it found in west triangle for example it will move west , but it doesnt see north and south triangle :D
2011-11-12T07:46:50  <mleise> Flapadar: It *IS* in the Lua starter -> ants.config
2011-11-12T07:47:10  <ikaros> Flapadar, i have lua and hills implemented its no big deal
2011-11-12T07:47:30  <mleise> I don't know the Lua syntax, but it may be something like ants.config[viewradius2]
2011-11-12T07:48:48  <Flapadar> ants.config doesn't have all the members listed, and there's no way to output the members once they're loaded as stdout is used by python for directions. If there's a data file with the input to the bot, I can just read that and see what's being put in it.
2011-11-12T07:48:55  <Flapadar> ikaros - is it just another index for a land type?
2011-11-12T07:49:10  <Flapadar> maybe == 5 ?
2011-11-12T07:49:55  <ikaros> Flapadar, http://pastebin.com/4CzSdqVN
2011-11-12T07:50:00  <ikaros> have a look here how i do it
2011-11-12T07:50:04  <mleise> Flapadar: you can use stderr to print debug info
2011-11-12T07:50:15  <ikaros> just dont copy everything because i have changed ants to state and other stuff

2011-11-12T07:51:03  <Flapadar> Thanks ikaros, mleise
2011-11-12T07:51:33  <ikaros> to print to a file you can use logfile = io.open("bot.log", "w") , logfile:write("blabla") and dont forget logfile:close() in the end
2011-11-12T07:52:20  <ikaros> i changed some things in the former ants.lua file.. there were parameters which didnt exist and other were missing
2011-11-12T07:52:30  <ikaros> you should be able to look this up on the pastebin link
2011-11-12T07:53:38  <robinski> Hope someone can help me out, after submitting my code, I keep getting "Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases"
2011-11-12T07:53:49  <robinski> would anyone be able to point me to some more information on fixing this
2011-11-12T07:54:11  <ikaros> you can run the test locally perhaps you see whats wrong there
2011-11-12T07:54:43  <ikaros> its tools/test_bot.sh
2011-11-12T07:55:09  <robinski> actually I did run the test_bot on my windows machine, no errors or problems arose
2011-11-12T07:56:21  <robinski> I guess it could be a difference in Mono C# and Microsoft C#... guess I now have to figure out what difference
2011-11-12T07:57:54  <ProperChaos> doesn't it give you any extra information why it failed the test cases?
2011-11-12T07:58:51  <ProperChaos> you could also try running playgame.py with --strict flag
2011-11-12T07:59:18  <Flapadar> That reminds me - is there any way to get a stack trace when a bot times out? Mine seems to time out when I hit a large number of ants, not sure whether its my use of astar being inefficient or other parts of my code being inefficient
2011-11-12T07:59:22  <robinski> ProperChaos: Well it tells me the bot crashed during testing... but not as to why
2011-11-12T07:59:58  <Flapadar> robinski - add  -e --capture_errors to the command line file
2011-11-12T08:00:17  <ProperChaos> Flapadar: you could do some performance tests locally?

2011-11-12T08:02:05  <robinski> Flapadar:  well the bot is not crashing at my end, and the --capture_errors is already in... I somehow crashes after submission
2011-11-12T08:02:30  <ProperChaos> robinski: perhaps you could install Mono and test using that compiler?
2011-11-12T08:02:44  <Flapadar> Try increasing the number of turns locally to something high like 1000. If it still doesn't crash, install mono :P
2011-11-12T08:04:26  <robinski> I'll go install mono...  guess that will be the best way of testing

2011-11-12T10:08:43  <yahim91> how do you guys find path and don't get timeout?
2011-11-12T10:09:22  <grwip> I store short paths sections
2011-11-12T10:09:38  <grwip> between some kind of crossroads that I set up while exploring
2011-11-12T10:09:59  <pairofdice> My ants google theirs paths
2011-11-12T10:10:05  <grwip> nice
2011-11-12T10:10:54  <pairofdice> maps.google.com
2011-11-12T10:11:16  <yahim91> what algorithm do you use, bfs a *?
2011-11-12T10:11:21  <bugnuts> I do BFS for the whole map and iterate
2011-11-12T10:11:25  <grwip> a*
2011-11-12T10:11:45  <bugnuts> scales a bit better than A* with lots of ants.
2011-11-12T10:12:13  <grwip> bugnuts: what do you mean by 'scales'?
2011-11-12T10:12:50  <pairofdice> You do it once if it's 5 ants, you do it once if it's 500 ants
2011-11-12T10:12:55  <yahim91> i suppose you find the path starting from  food to ant
2011-11-12T10:12:55  <pairofdice> Scales well
2011-11-12T10:13:14  <bugnuts> yeah
2011-11-12T10:13:38  <grwip> ah ok, I do it the other way around...
2011-11-12T10:15:08  <yahim91> so you find the path between the crossroad and the food because it is a smaller path ?
2011-11-12T10:16:46  <marijnfs_> you can easily create a distance map from all the food simultaneously
2011-11-12T10:16:50  <marijnfs_> should be fast and not time out
2011-11-12T10:17:01  <marijnfs_> if you do bfs smartly
2011-11-12T10:17:04  <marijnfs_> dijkstra style
2011-11-12T10:17:10  <grwip> no for each ant I collect what is reachable within their view radius (food, enemies, hills) and then find the path for the first one around
2011-11-12T10:17:32  <grwip> not the most efficient way I know but that kind of works well
2011-11-12T10:17:51  <yahim91> thanks grwip
2011-11-12T10:18:36  <yahim91> marijnfs, the map you said is just for an ant ?
2011-11-12T10:19:12  <marijnfs_> no for every square you get a distance to the closest food
2011-11-12T10:19:47  <marijnfs_> and your ant can then look at the squares around him and move to the square that has the shortest distance
2011-11-12T10:20:05  <pairofdice> pretty simple

2011-11-12T11:28:04  <Extrarius> the way the server works is to launch your bot with stdin and stdout set to pipes and the server sends the updates to your bot and reads the output
2011-11-12T11:28:49  <Zao> My solution to debugging is to have the bot listen on TCP and use netcat as the bot executable.
2011-11-12T11:29:28  <Extrarius> Zao: I suppose sockets are probably the 'more linux' way of doing it
2011-11-12T11:30:47  <Zao> Extrarius: I picked it mostly because netcat exists on just about any OS, including Windows.

2011-11-12T12:43:49  <pairofdice> But I have an introductory book to c++ and a lot of free time.
2011-11-12T12:44:00  <pairofdice> And I've been meaning to 'branch out'
2011-11-12T12:45:32  <Minthos> C++ can certainly make your bot faster
2011-11-12T12:46:01  <Minthos> but the price is a little piece of your soul for each line you write
2011-11-12T12:46:03  <bergmark> I was shocked by how much faster java was than Ruby.  I switch and 100ms searches went to 0-2ms.  I'm sure C++/C would have been even more mind blowing.
2011-11-12T12:46:20  <yoden> ruby is one of the slowest languages
2011-11-12T12:46:23  <Minthos> ruby is notoriously slow
2011-11-12T12:46:49  <yoden> my turns are all under 10ms... so java is too fast
2011-11-12T12:46:52  <yoden> clearly xD
2011-11-12T12:46:56  <yoden> no need c++
2011-11-12T12:47:02  <Minthos> the difference between java and C is very small in comparison
2011-11-12T12:47:11  <bergmark> JIT/Hotspot does a lot to close the gap I think

2011-11-12T12:52:59  <pedrosorio> but now I've decided I want to challenge myself and do a top500 using Octave
2011-11-12T12:53:06  <p_l> bergmark: Ruby has one of the slower implementations out there

2011-11-12T13:37:24  <pedrosorio> thestinger: really????
2011-11-12T13:37:28  <BenJackson_> Octave (and Matlab) are both pretty fast as long as you do vector operations
2011-11-12T13:37:39  <BenJackson_> pedrosorio:
2011-11-12T13:37:49  <pedrosorio> BenJackson_: have you tried it? ;)
2011-11-12T13:37:58  <BenJackson_> not for this contest
2011-11-12T13:38:05  <pairofdice> Surprise us with eigenvectors
2011-11-12T13:38:36  <BenJackson_> in Octave if you have some vector of numbers and want to operate on them all in parallel, like a .* 5 .+ 7
2011-11-12T13:38:41  <BenJackson_> that's way way faster than writing a for loop in octave
2011-11-12T13:39:06  <BenJackson_> so as long as you can think/write your code in terms of all ants in parallel rather than one at a time you'll be fine
2011-11-12T13:39:12  <pedrosorio> BenJackson_ I know how to use Octave/Matlab and the general guidelines of optimization, otheriwse I wouldn't be trying to do it
2011-11-12T13:39:18  <BenJackson_> ah
2011-11-12T13:39:24  <pedrosorio> but it's not trivial like say, in C++
2011-11-12T13:39:31  <pedrosorio> that's why it's a challenge for me
2011-11-12T13:39:42  <BenJackson_> I kind of think that Octave might be easier than python
2011-11-12T13:40:06  <BenJackson_> they're probably similar for interpreted speed but octave can do lots of the math "built in"
2011-11-12T13:40:21  <pedrosorio> BenJackson_: nah
2011-11-12T13:40:51  <pedrosorio> I've tried implementing BFS naively (i.e. "normal" programming) in octave you waste your turn time doing one of those
2011-11-12T13:42:49  <BenJackson_> well I think my goal for today is tossing out my variant of CD and doing something entirely different

2011-11-12T13:53:16  <pairofdice> Run away untill you get rescued
2011-11-12T13:53:20  <pairofdice> I know that tactic
2011-11-12T13:53:22  <roflmao> that is nearby but outside of shooting range

2011-11-12T13:53:36  <roflmao> lol pairofdice that works too :P
2011-11-12T13:53:38  <pedrosorio> run to the hill!
2011-11-12T13:53:51  <roflmao> you tell it to go to the outline of the combat radius + 1
2011-11-12T13:54:06  <roflmao> so it will be ONE square away from engaging in combat
2011-11-12T13:54:31  <roflmao> and you grab your ant's nearest friend
2011-11-12T13:54:32  <roflmao> and send him to the same outline
2011-11-12T13:54:34  <roflmao> once both ants are on the outline right outside of combat range
2011-11-12T13:54:40  <roflmao> send them in to zap the enemy ant
2011-11-12T13:54:50  <roflmao> two gang up on one, you don't lose an ant and he does
2011-11-12T13:55:00  <roflmao> i explained that horrible
2011-11-12T13:55:02  <roflmao> horribly*
2011-11-12T13:55:27  <roflmao> BTW kind of pro tip:
2011-11-12T13:55:39  <roflmao> if you hack ants.py you can make it so that maps don't have to be symmetrical
2011-11-12T13:55:47  <roflmao> so you can create test scenarios to test your algorithms
2011-11-12T13:56:00  <roflmao> i found some horribly wrong bugs in my algorithms that just weren't obvious in a full game with hundreds of ants
2011-11-12T13:56:12  <roflmao> but when you have a controlled environment you can really test your algorithms well
2011-11-12T13:56:36  <roflmao> so right now I have two ants close to one enemy ant and I want to code it so they zap that enemy ant without losing any myself
2011-11-12T13:57:47  <thestinger> pedrosorio: yeah, I'm actually using the dead ant info for something small :P
2011-11-12T13:58:18  <thestinger> for figuring out if the enemy ants are staying on their hill or moving off immediately when I'm trying to raze it
2011-11-12T13:58:43  <thestinger> so now I can avoid sacrificing all my ants when they are staying on their hill (by surround it and waiting for it to drain)
2011-11-12T13:58:54  <thestinger> but I'll still try to take it right away if they aren't staying on their hill
2011-11-12T13:59:24  <pedrosorio> hmmm interesting
2011-11-12T14:00:00  <pedrosorio> when implementing the octave starter package I thought no one would use them for anything :P
2011-11-12T14:02:24  <amstan> pedrosorio: good surprise eh?
2011-11-12T14:02:33  <BenJackson_> thestinger: I once saw my bot set up a perfect killzone at a hill and zap dozens of ants
2011-11-12T14:02:46  <BenJackson_> but then there was a gap so one of the killers stepped up and then there was chaos
2011-11-12T14:03:45  <thestinger> yeah, I made it so my ants wouldn't just suicide onto hills with ants coming out of them - but they ended up doing the same thing by waiting next to hill with ants moving off it right away :P
2011-11-12T14:03:57  <pedrosorio> amstan: bad surprise because I didn't implement them as the way it was in C++ was too slow for Octave =X
2011-11-12T14:03:57  <thestinger> so they were all dying from the enemy ants colliding into them
2011-11-12T14:04:54  <pedrosorio> I just left a comment line saying you can implement it in the state grid if you want (something as simple as keeping a rows*columns*maxplayers tensor to keep count of dead ants for each player, should be enough)
2011-11-12T14:06:57  <thestinger> BenJackson_: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.30714 here's the game where I noticed the issue
2011-11-12T14:07:19  <thestinger> you can see all my ants dying to the hill near the end, but they're actually dying b/c they are waiting next to it and the enemy ant is colliding with them
2011-11-12T14:07:35  <BenJackson_> my ants are fairly good about that
2011-11-12T14:07:56  <BenJackson_> however I just watched a replay where I could have taken a couple decisive steps and instead let a DIFFERENT ant cap the hill
2011-11-12T14:08:02  <BenJackson_> left to myself I would have gotten it

2011-11-12T15:25:57  <pairofdice> It's easy to 'reuse' the results of BFS for all the ants. A* is a bit trickier

2011-11-12T15:27:36  <BenJackson_> when I first started looking at aichallenge I thought about using Floyd Warshall to compute all paths
2011-11-12T15:28:20  <BenJackson_> it's O(n^3) but that seemed ok for map sizes of 150.. until my brain kicked in and I realized that n is the area there so it's more like n^6 in the width of the map
2011-11-12T15:28:24  <BenJackson_> with similar storage requirements :)

2011-11-12T15:57:04  <ikaros> im confused.. how can those ants kill each other if the attackradius2==5 http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=screenshothq8d2.png
2011-11-12T15:57:52  <_flag> They kill each other next turn
2011-11-12T15:58:16  <ikaros> but the current attackradius ^2 is equal to 16
2011-11-12T15:58:19  <ikaros> i dont get it
2011-11-12T15:58:23  <jix> ikaros: that's just the way the visualizer works... it draws the fight lines during the move resulting in the fight
2011-11-12T15:58:27  <_flag> Next turn they both move towards each other
2011-11-12T15:58:31  <ikaros> ahhh
2011-11-12T15:58:32  <jix> ikaros: so the lines are already there before they actually fight
2011-11-12T15:58:37  <ikaros> ok thanks guys
2011-11-12T15:58:42  <jix> but otherwise it would be hard to see them
2011-11-12T15:58:45  <ikaros> was thinking i was going mad
2011-11-12T15:58:56  <BenJackson_> ikaros: the replay is divided into two steps per turn
2011-11-12T15:59:04  <ikaros> because i checked several games and it was like this everywhere :)
2011-11-12T15:59:07  <ikaros> yea
2011-11-12T15:59:12  <BenJackson_> watch the turn counter as you hit the step button
2011-11-12T15:59:19  <ikaros> my mistake because i used the arrow keys
2011-11-12T15:59:34  <ikaros> they just skip the half turns
2011-11-12T15:59:57  <BenJackson_> oh cool, I didn't know about arrow keys

2011-11-12T17:23:26  <mcstar> try with -cp and the class name

2011-11-12T17:25:49  <mcstar> where they are

2011-11-12T17:29:40  <mcstar> if the classes are right there

2011-11-12T17:53:51  <delt0r_> mikewintermute: the default package... or the package the file belongs to is automatically included as a "import"
2011-11-12T17:54:32  <mikewintermute> aha - you mean Bot.java?
2011-11-12T17:54:39  <delt0r_> note also that a single file can have more than one class too
2011-11-12T17:54:43  <delt0r_> ?
2011-11-12T17:55:22  <mikewintermute> so: public class MyBot extends Bot
2011-11-12T17:55:31  <mikewintermute> means import Bot.java, right?

2011-11-12T18:20:35  <Rinum> what's the problem?
2011-11-12T18:20:46  <avdg> is it round?
2011-11-12T18:20:54  <amstan> i'm filling a blank(all dirt) map randomly with water
2011-11-12T18:20:58  <Rinum> mikewintermute: haha nice! wintermute... from neuromancer
2011-11-12T18:20:59  <amstan> 50% chance that it gets to be a water
2011-11-12T18:21:15  <amstan> now.. placing a water is symmetric, so water might get placed to other areas too
2011-11-12T18:21:28  <amstan> what percentage of water will i have at the end?
2011-11-12T18:21:51  <mikewintermute> Rinum: darn. discovered.

2011-11-12T18:22:34  <Rinum> amstan: 50% chance each square is water?
2011-11-12T18:23:00  <amstan> Rinum: yes, but i have symmetry going on, so placing water at 0,0 will also place it at 9,9(given the map is 10x10)
2011-11-12T18:23:33  <avdg> isn't that around 75% chance, or am I solving it too quickly?
2011-11-12T18:23:39  <amstan> idk
2011-11-12T18:23:47  <amstan> hmm, i could go around this by making stuff to dirt
2011-11-12T18:23:48  <Rinum> amstan: are you looping through each square on the grid?
2011-11-12T18:23:50  <amstan> yes
2011-11-12T18:24:26  <Rinum> so 50% 0,0 is water AND 50% 9,9 is water... and if either is water then both is water?
2011-11-12T18:24:55  <amstan> yes
2011-11-12T18:25:04  <grwip> 50%
2011-11-12T18:25:24  <Rinum> it has to be > 50%, no?
2011-11-12T18:25:29  <grwip> hmm yes
2011-11-12T18:26:04  <grwip> you should just run through one of the symetric parts no?
2011-11-12T18:26:13  <grwip> this way you get 50% water, simple
2011-11-12T18:26:17  <avdg> well, I see the problem like this: you draw on the map randomly twice (50%)
2011-11-12T18:26:35  <avdg> so you have 4 states in the end
2011-11-12T18:26:48  <amstan> grwip: i don't know what my one symmetric area is
2011-11-12T18:26:55  <grwip> oh ok
2011-11-12T18:27:04  <avdg> 1) none of the layers draw a pixel 2&3) 1 of the layers draw a pixel 4) both draw a pixel
2011-11-12T18:27:17  <amstan> avdg: yes, i tried dividing by number of symmetric areas, but i will have much less than 50% then
2011-11-12T18:27:34  <amstan> avdg: because it can't put water where there's already water
2011-11-12T18:27:42  <avdg> yeah, what am I telling?
2011-11-12T18:27:51  <avdg> (state 4)
2011-11-12T18:28:10  <amstan> hmm?
2011-11-12T18:28:16  <avdg> but maybe I'm just explaining it badly
2011-11-12T18:29:16  <avdg> (or I don't get it)
2011-11-12T18:29:48  <grwip> but you'll have a porblme doing it like that because you'll have much more water in the second part of your map
2011-11-12T18:30:10  <grwip> no, I'm off, too late
2011-11-12T18:30:11  <grwip> sorry
2011-11-12T18:30:16  <mikewintermute> amstan: as long as you don't run any probabilities on the symmetric squares it should come out to 50%
2011-11-12T18:30:27  <amstan> grwip: putting water at 9,9 also puts water at 1,1
2011-11-12T18:30:50  <mikewintermute> not sure if that helps
2011-11-12T18:30:50  <grwip> amstan: yep I got it, but a bit too late, 'think before typing'
2011-11-12T18:31:04  <avdg> (hmm, I think I have to revert my question, so I get that 75% into a 50%)
2011-11-12T18:31:53  <avdg> hmm, what about 33%
2011-11-12T18:32:06  <mcstar> amstan: if water is placed translationally symmetrically, than its always 50 percent

2011-11-12T18:32:55  <mcstar> but of course this changes if you have other constraints
2011-11-12T18:32:55  <avdg> if you fill the map 33%, add symmetric on top of it, it should result in around 50% and if I still don't get it, I may need a better example :p

2011-11-12T18:34:06  <amstan> ok.. would it be easier if for every square i turn it to dirt right before i decide if i should make it water again?
2011-11-12T18:34:10  <amstan> will i get 50% then?
2011-11-12T18:34:42  <mcstar> amstan: what are you trying to do?
2011-11-12T18:34:47  <amstan> yeah, i should, the state of the spot before will not affect the percentage probability of the output

2011-11-12T18:36:02  <mcstar> amstan: you better fill up a bravais cell with 50 percent random water anyway it happends, than tile this to fill the map
2011-11-12T18:36:12  <Rinum_> therefore, either both squares are not water or they both are... so 50%

2011-11-12T18:43:48  <grwip> I think 1/6
2011-11-12T18:44:09  <mikewintermute> hmmâ¦ "type" or "sort"
2011-11-12T18:44:19  <grwip> I think we want to solve 3 * P(Water) = 1/2
2011-11-12T18:44:24  <mikewintermute> bizarre
2011-11-12T18:44:37  <amstan> hmm
2011-11-12T18:44:38  <avdg> hmm, 3 layers?
2011-11-12T18:45:03  <grwip> because with the two linked tiles on the map we have WW WL LW against LL
2011-11-12T18:45:08  <amstan> this random walk business up to 50% is hard, because there's no way for me to count how many squares are water except with an interator
2011-11-12T18:45:27  <amstan> i can't do an accumulator because more than one water might be placed
2011-11-12T18:45:53  <grwip> no that's not it...
2011-11-12T18:46:15  <avdg> I'll stick with my 33% until I know more ;-)
2011-11-12T18:46:38  <amstan> nvm, i can just divide
2011-11-12T18:47:57  <avdg> hmm
2011-11-12T18:48:02  <avdg> what about wolframalpha
2011-11-12T18:48:11  <grwip> ok I guess it's 1/4 : with P(W) = p we have P(WW) = p^2, P(WL) = P(LW) = p(1-p)
2011-11-12T18:48:38  <grwip> so we want to solve p^2 + 2p(1-p) = 1/2
2011-11-12T18:49:04  <grwip> which is note 1/4 but I think it's what we want to solve

2011-11-12T18:49:53  <avdg> which is totally different from what I was thinking
2011-11-12T18:51:21  <avdg> unless its calculating something else...
2011-11-12T18:51:46  <grwip> it is calculating something else, here P is the zeta function
2011-11-12T18:52:10  <avdg> ah
2011-11-12T18:52:14  <avdg> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=permutations
2011-11-12T18:53:28  <grwip> ok, I say P(w) = 29.28%
2011-11-12T18:54:21  <grwip> which is the solution to  p^2 + 2p(1-p) = 1/2
2011-11-12T18:54:48  <avdg> this? http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+p%5E2+%2B+2p%281-p%29+%3D+1%2F2

2011-11-12T18:57:09  <amstan> my primary concern now is how to make random walk maps where the bases stay connected without generating until my bfs works
2011-11-12T18:57:12  <avdg> its still something interesting to see how we are trying to solve this
2011-11-12T18:57:43  <pedrosorio> hmm
2011-11-12T18:57:48  <avdg> hmm, I was thinking at bfs until I read the last words
2011-11-12T18:58:08  <amstan> well, i guess i could put the bfs inside the loop
2011-11-12T18:58:12  <amstan> but that will be pretty slow
2011-11-12T18:58:38  <amstan> what i really don't want through is have something like while(!bases connected): generate_new_map()
2011-11-12T18:58:38  <avdg> hmm, I wonder how slow
2011-11-12T18:59:09  <amstan> avdg: i'm looping 10 times over the whole map and it's very slow(a second)
2011-11-12T18:59:44  <mcstar> i still dont get what the problem is
2011-11-12T19:00:04  <avdg> hmm, what about doing an a* to both sides every step? (quick idiot thinking)
2011-11-12T19:00:13  <pedrosorio> I also don't understand

2011-11-12T19:00:35  <pedrosorio> the way you generate a map is

2011-11-12T19:06:00  <pedrosorio> I don't see how you could have a simply connected map
2011-11-12T19:06:04  <pedrosorio> in this game
2011-11-12T19:06:07  <avdg> still faster than bfs
2011-11-12T19:06:16  <amstan> avdg: i need it like 100 times faster
2011-11-12T19:06:28  <amstan> avdg: actually, it might work
2011-11-12T19:06:35  <BenJackson_> you guys realize that a properly implemented BFS is linear in the size of the map
2011-11-12T19:06:42  <BenJackson_> it should be no worse than 'for all rows, for all cols, do something'
2011-11-12T19:06:48  <amstan> BenJackson_: still too big
2011-11-12T19:06:52  <BenJackson_> ie a loop to about 10-20k
2011-11-12T19:06:52  <mcstar> n^2 i.e.
2011-11-12T19:07:01  <pedrosorio> 40.000 is a lot :(
2011-11-12T19:07:03  <BenJackson_> n in the area of the map
2011-11-12T19:07:16  <pedrosorio> the problem with this map generation
2011-11-12T19:07:19  <mcstar> you want to think in vertices here
2011-11-12T19:07:23  <mcstar> thats n^2
2011-11-12T19:07:24  <avdg> but I wonder how to find the closes tile quickly
2011-11-12T19:07:30  <pedrosorio> is that I haven't looked into all the kinds of symmetries you are using
2011-11-12T19:07:35  <pedrosorio> so I can't really say anything about it

2011-11-12T19:07:51  <BenJackson_> on a modern CPU you could literally do 1 bfs *from every point on the map* in about 1 second
2011-11-12T19:07:56  <avdg> it would be faster to find an earlier discovered tile
2011-11-12T19:08:24  <mcstar> BenJackson_: i think amstan wants to do that (needs) with every new water tile added

2011-11-12T19:09:57  <BenJackson_> pedrosorio: right, I said "properly implemented BFS", but that can be tricky if you lack (for example) a proper queue data structure
2011-11-12T19:10:11  <BenJackson_> if you simulate your queue with list copies then it IS n^2 in the area of the map

2011-11-12T19:13:54  <pedrosorio> hmm
2011-11-12T19:14:37  <pedrosorio> but your random walk can wander the whole map?
2011-11-12T19:14:40  <mcstar> so there is only 1 seed location
2011-11-12T19:14:43  <amstan> pedrosorio: yes
2011-11-12T19:14:47  <amstan> mcstar: yes
2011-11-12T19:15:12  <mcstar> so are you saying smooth() is slow?
2011-11-12T19:15:50  <mcstar> it shouldnt be, since you only apply an 8-point stencil on every piel

2011-11-12T19:18:01  <nickjohnson> So your water will be connected. Couldn't you reverse it and start with all water and go around in a random walk deleting it?
2011-11-12T19:18:05  <BenJackson_> amstan: you could probably make the python map gen faster by doing it as an image
2011-11-12T19:18:18  <BenJackson_> and applying PIL functions to dialate/erode/etc images

2011-11-12T19:19:36  <nickjohnson> amstan: If I understood correctly, you're worried about the land staying fully connected
2011-11-12T19:19:45  <nickjohnson> If you do a random walk of land instead of water, it is by definition
2011-11-12T19:19:46  <amstan> g2g
2011-11-12T19:20:31  <mcstar> just shoot the whole map with random coordinates, remove the water if its still connected(has enough nbors) dont do it otherwise

2011-11-12T19:25:50  <mcstar> yep for me too
2011-11-12T19:25:54  <BenJackson_> the answer is really "don't do that" (don't mix .o's from mismatched .h's)

2011-11-12T19:33:25  <BenJackson_> if you add a member to a class in the .h and some other .cpp (not the one that defines its methods, necessarily) declares one, any stale .o will use the wrong size

2011-11-12T20:08:32  <LouisMartin> rofl- coding AI bot while producing in your met lab is kinda cool if you ask me. It's totally worth loosing some of the product.

2011-11-12T20:21:12  <LouisMartin> here's some interesting bits: Correlations have been found between latent Toxoplasma infections and various characteristics:[30] Decreased novelty seeking behaviour[31] Slower reactions[32] Lower rule-consciousness and greater jealousy (in men)[31] Greater warmth, conscientiousness and moralistic behavior (in women)[31]

2011-11-12T20:32:47  <LouisMartin> nah, but I like RedBull and RockStar way, too, much.  doesn't count?
2011-11-12T20:33:09  <mcstar> no, i just imlemented a game-tree search and it turned out not to be as productive as i hoped
2011-11-12T20:33:29  <mcstar> and i rewrite my path-handling too
2011-11-12T20:33:39  <LouisMartin> game-tree search?
2011-11-12T20:33:45  <mcstar> only to find that its too complicated, and there are unanticipated problems
2011-11-12T20:33:53  <mcstar> and a much simpler approach is better
2011-11-12T20:34:08  <mcstar> my bot beats all other bots it played with recently in food collection

2011-11-12T20:36:02  <LouisMartin> sure, but simpler approaches may not be the one winning the contest after a few succeed in making a smarter "Top-Bottom" AI.  That's harder to get it right, but it will make the "little minimax dancers" look like fools when it does.
2011-11-12T20:36:53  <LouisMartin> mcstar: I hear you.  I know that feeling and it sucks.
2011-11-12T20:37:13  <mcstar> LouisMartin: there are no minimax dancers
2011-11-12T20:37:16  <mcstar> there wont be any
2011-11-12T20:37:30  <LouisMartin> why? what do you mean?
2011-11-12T20:37:55  <mcstar> all those "dancing" bots do a 1-turn search
2011-11-12T20:38:01  <mcstar> that is hardly minimax
2011-11-12T20:38:11  <mcstar> the search space is so enermous, it wont work
2011-11-12T20:38:18  <mcstar> or only with very aggresive pruning
2011-11-12T20:38:26  <mcstar> and it would still be bad
2011-11-12T20:38:38  <LouisMartin> I disagree mcstar

2011-11-12T20:38:54  <mcstar> now
2011-11-12T20:39:08  <pedrosorio> we should really have lots of simple cpu's doing the processing of each ant
2011-11-12T20:39:11  <LouisMartin> the tile states are very limited. this isn't chess
2011-11-12T20:39:27  <pedrosorio> instead we have a single-core controlling all the ants :P
2011-11-12T20:39:37  <mcstar> LouisMartin: did you do some back-of-the-envelope calculation?
2011-11-12T20:39:43  <mcstar> or did you actually write it?
2011-11-12T20:39:53  <LouisMartin> one could include in his code a lot of situations and just do look-ups ..
2011-11-12T20:40:06  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-12T20:40:25  <pedrosorio> mcstar: "openings"
2011-11-12T20:40:25  <mcstar> lets talk about that when you have a working code
2011-11-12T20:40:36  <LouisMartin> you precalculate situations and save them in your code files

2011-11-12T20:41:26  <mcstar> wont work
2011-11-12T20:42:19  <LouisMartin> you don't minimax the whole board all the time.  you use it wisely and you search in the cache rather than calculate everything all the time.  if you end up calculating a scenario you don't have in your lookup table, then at least cache it.

2011-11-12T20:45:59  <LouisMartin> antimony: sure, but feasability depends on the (2d) space you process.  if you try it on 100 x 100 then, yes, that's ridiculous.
2011-11-12T20:46:06  <Antimony> anyway, it's more like game theory than minimax due to simulataneous movement
2011-11-12T20:46:06  <mcstar> have you wrote any software like that before?
2011-11-12T20:46:16  <mcstar> chess is much more understood than Ants
2011-11-12T20:46:22  <Antimony> I've written simple Chess AIs before
2011-11-12T20:46:29  <roflmao> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=90239&user=2772
2011-11-12T20:46:32  <Antimony> I still haven't managed to get any combat for my nats bot yet
2011-11-12T20:46:36  <roflmao> wow goldcadyy's bot looks awesome!!
2011-11-12T20:46:56  <mcstar> Antimony: i dont think thats a problem
2011-11-12T20:47:09  <mcstar> just imagine they are making its moves in succession
2011-11-12T20:47:32  <mcstar> but it might not be correct in a strict mathematical sense
2011-11-12T20:47:43  <mcstar> i dont know, am not a game theorist
2011-11-12T20:47:46  <LouisMartin> mcstar: you don't have to define any best move yourself. you write the code to find the best moves in a given context in a (very small) given spaces and then you include the data in your code file so as to use it as lookup tables...
2011-11-12T20:47:52  <Antimony> for now I'll be happy to be able to do a 1ply search assumign the enemy stays still
2011-11-12T20:48:06  <mcstar> Antimony: yo dont have to
2011-11-12T20:48:11  <mcstar> my code does that in no time
2011-11-12T20:48:20  <mcstar> i mean 1 ply is perfectly ok
2011-11-12T20:48:37  <Antimony> well I'll see how it is once I actually get something implemented
2011-11-12T20:48:39  <mcstar> well, of course you have to limit the number of participants
2011-11-12T20:48:45  <Antimony> that's my problem
2011-11-12T20:48:49  <Antimony> I don't limit participants
2011-11-12T20:48:56  <mcstar> you need to
2011-11-12T20:49:07  <mcstar> you cant do that on the whole map at once
2011-11-12T20:49:40  <mcstar> i tried a 10 player 1-ply search, took 10 seconds approximately

2011-11-12T20:55:22  <grwip> not sure if it's a bug or it's just too late for me to look at haskell code... but I had a look at the starter package and something looks strange
2011-11-12T20:56:00  <LouisMartin> Fluxid, hey. How are ya?   We were speaking of battle AI and I tried to remember what you told me you had for that.  didn't you told me about a 16x16 grid? was that for exploration (whole map) or for a minimax-like implementation of 16x16 pixels?

2011-11-12T20:56:31  <mcstar> this brown spider sucks soo much
2011-11-12T20:56:40  <mcstar> has flesh necrotizing venom
2011-11-12T20:57:19  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: "minimax-like" tree with 16 leaves
2011-11-12T20:57:31  <janzert> mcstar: looks like what we would call a brown recluse
2011-11-12T20:57:39  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-12T20:57:40  <Fluxid> but i plan to rework it, just need to gather energy
2011-11-12T20:58:30  <janzert> those and black widows are the only poisonous spiders around where I live \o/
2011-11-12T20:58:41  <roflmao> you mean it eats your flesh
2011-11-12T20:58:46  <roflmao> but doesn't stop?
2011-11-12T20:59:08  <LouisMartin> fluxid: Okay. Is it actually minimax?
2011-11-12T20:59:17  <janzert> roflmao: nah, they generally only bite humans when they feel threatened
2011-11-12T20:59:27  <roflmao> but
2011-11-12T20:59:29  <roflmao> once oyu get bit
2011-11-12T20:59:34  <roflmao> you have like an infection that just keeps on growing
2011-11-12T20:59:37  <janzert> but the venom then kills a good chunk of flesh
2011-11-12T20:59:38  <Rinum> I've heard of once spider that once it bites you
2011-11-12T20:59:59  <Rinum> other spiders ( of the same species) will be attracted to you ( to bite you)
2011-11-12T21:00:16  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: probably not, but it somehow works :D
2011-11-12T21:01:02  <Fluxid> i'm bad with naming things, "it" does work but it's not the best
2011-11-12T21:01:03  <janzert> Rinum: I've seen that used in a story but I've never heard of it being factual but no idea really
2011-11-12T21:01:03  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: haha!  that's my kind of software engineering spirit :)
2011-11-12T21:01:15  <mcstar> roflmao: the venom spreads fast in the blood vessels, and in a couple of days that flesh simply dies
2011-11-12T21:01:19  <mcstar> rots away

2011-11-12T21:01:57  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: Alright. Well, it got you pretty far so it must do something good
2011-11-12T21:02:28  <LouisMartin> Fluxid- Yep. Doesn't most people here?

2011-11-12T21:14:30  <avdg> speed shouldn't be an issue in this contest, but if there is an opportunity, go for it

2011-11-12T21:15:15  <janzert> the real question is what are any downsides to enabling it?

2011-11-12T21:16:02  <janzert> hmm, I would find that hard to believe ;)
2011-11-12T21:16:23  <LouisMartin> compilation time isn't different on my side
2011-11-12T21:16:37  <janzert> how about less intelligible runtime error messages?
2011-11-12T21:16:41  <LouisMartin> there's downsides, but not in the contest settings
2011-11-12T21:16:44  <janzert> more memory use?
2011-11-12T21:17:07  <avdg> compile time?
2011-11-12T21:17:13  <LouisMartin> that'd be it (debugging), but we don't remote debug on your server unfortunately ;)
2011-11-12T21:17:27  <LouisMartin> compile time is the same for me
2011-11-12T21:17:39  <LouisMartin> not more memory use from what I see on my side
2011-11-12T21:18:12  <roflmao> I think I just hit my sweet spot
2011-11-12T21:19:56  <LouisMartin> is the server x86 or x64?

2011-11-12T21:23:33  <LouisMartin> avdg: you think been able to implement better (and usually more cpu voracious) algo can't make a difference in the contest?   I think C/C++ can afford way more analysis than some other language.. why do you think it doesn't matter?

2011-11-12T21:28:28  <LouisMartin> avdg: right, but I'm thinking between 2 equally competent and efficient programmers: the C++ one can afford much complex strategies/algo than some much slower language, and so is advantaged by the language.  Which is fine, but better minimized when possible; as you agreed

2011-11-12T22:12:35  <BenJackson> me too
2011-11-12T22:12:46  <BenJackson> I only found *one* visualization of tron anywhere
2011-11-12T22:13:09  <amstan> LouisMartin: tron's at csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest
2011-11-12T22:13:21  <amstan> LouisMartin: pw is temporarly inaccessible
2011-11-12T22:13:25  <anon> amstan: a linear programming solver solves linear optimization problems. See e.g. http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Libraries
2011-11-12T22:13:31  <LouisMartin> ok thanks
2011-11-12T22:13:36  <amstan> LouisMartin: if you really want to get it point ai-contest.com to the ip of jpcameron.com in your hosts file
2011-11-12T22:13:45  <amstan> anon: numpy and scipy are available
2011-11-12T22:14:05  <jbroman> anon: Worst-case, you can always bundle your library of choice with your bot.
2011-11-12T22:14:07  <LouisMartin> ok
2011-11-12T22:14:45  <jbroman> (Well, perhaps not if it requires additional binary extensions. But generally.)
2011-11-12T22:14:52  <BenJackson> amstan: I've seen that site but it appears to be broken

2011-11-12T22:15:26  <BenJackson> I see controls but nothing else
2011-11-12T22:15:46  <anon> numpy and scipy are great to have, but unfortunately they don't seem to include an LP solver.
2011-11-12T22:16:29  <amstan> BenJackson: i don't know myself actually
2011-11-12T22:16:38  <anon> Any LP solver advanced enough to do what I want will probably have portions written in C and hence not be includable with my bot
2011-11-12T22:17:01  <amstan> jbroman: can you look into it? i don't have powers over that db@csclub, is the games table still there?
2011-11-12T22:17:03  <anon> Oh well.
2011-11-12T22:17:19  <BenJackson> if you want a python graph library networkx is great
2011-11-12T22:17:38  <jbroman> amstan: Not sure what database that was in, or what the table was called.
2011-11-12T22:18:03  <amstan> jbroman: probably contest, games table, there's a replay column
2011-11-12T22:19:00  <pedrosorio> anon: but Octave does have an LP solver :P
2011-11-12T22:19:17  <LouisMartin> amstan: the tron game viewer doesn't work for me. Tried it in Chrome and IE.  The youtube video doesn't work neither.   not my luck.
2011-11-12T22:19:47  <jbroman> amstan: Table contest.games doesn't exist.
2011-11-12T22:19:55  <jbroman> Table in contest: news, submissions, users
2011-11-12T22:19:56  <amstan> jbroman: i was affraid of that, too bad
2011-11-12T22:20:06  <amstan> someone probably got pissed because of its size
2011-11-12T22:20:10  <amstan> and deleted it

2011-11-12T22:20:44  <BenJackson> when I saw the broken tron site (and couldn't even find pw) I was afraid ants would go the same way

2011-11-12T22:22:46  <anon> pedrosorio: I don't want an LP solver badly enough to deal with the ickiness that is programming in MATLAB/Octave
2011-11-12T22:22:51  <BenJackson> that's a lot of rows

2011-11-12T22:23:07  <amstan> yeah, no idea
2011-11-12T22:23:19  <amstan> seems like too many rows to be just a test, so let's be optimistic

2011-11-12T22:23:56  <jbroman> So it looks complete.

2011-11-12T22:25:25  <jbroman> BenJackson: Well presumably a mysqldump would be more useful than a printout like that.
2011-11-12T22:25:50  <BenJackson> that was a joke...
2011-11-12T22:25:56  <janzert> amstan: if we could get static crawls of each site we could stuff them into s3 and serve 'em from there and not have to worry about a server/database migration again

2011-11-12T23:38:08  <janzert> the ones I'm looking at seem correct at least
2011-11-12T23:38:58  <janzert> ChrisH_: remember your offset to UTC changed with the end of DST
2011-11-12T23:39:00  <ChrisH_> janzert: well, I'm not sure it is a DST issue, but there is something weird.  Look at my profile for example: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=10 the top game was ~ an hour ago, but hover text says 8 minutes
2011-11-12T23:39:27  <janzert> hmm
2011-11-12T23:39:47  <BenJackson> must use the same code as the part where it predicts your next game ;-)
2011-11-12T23:39:49  <ChrisH_> but the profile for the other bot in that game reports 50 mins ago
2011-11-12T23:39:55  <janzert> I wonder if profile information is put in memcache
2011-11-12T23:40:16  <ChrisH_> it's only the hover text that is wrong, the game time is right
2011-11-12T23:40:37  <janzert> right and the game time would stay correct but ago time would be outdated if pulled from a cache
2011-11-12T23:40:40  <ChrisH_> at least it is in sync with the current time reported at the top of my profile page
2011-11-12T23:41:39  <janzert> mind filing an issue?
2011-11-12T23:41:46  <ChrisH_> no problem.
2011-11-12T23:42:31  <janzert> thanks, I'm in the middle of making the next game prediction a little better anyway
2011-11-12T23:43:38  <janzert> I'd really just rather simplify the whole prediction so it was closer to true "within" prediction rather than trying to make a "best guess" prediction, but McLeopold really didn't want that
2011-11-12T23:44:54  <ChrisH_> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/366
2011-11-12T23:46:42  <ChrisH_> well, yeah, it is really problematic for new submissions because until they get about 10 games played their game rate is about 1/2 of what the prediction is expecting, so the prediction is overly optimistic and results in annoyed users.
2011-11-12T23:47:42  <janzert> currently it gets more overly optimistic the closer you are to the head of the queue
2011-11-12T23:47:53  <BenJackson> ..until it's negative!
2011-11-12T23:48:01  <ChrisH_> janzert: BTW, I finally made my second submission, so I'm no longer account #10 with submission #10.  ;)
2011-11-12T23:48:10  <janzert> the displayed time is taking the average of the prediction based on players per minute and games per minute
2011-11-12T23:48:17  <janzert> aww :(
2011-11-12T23:48:34  <Extrarius> amstan: what do you think of these maps: http://paste.aichallenge.org/WDpYR/   http://paste.aichallenge.org/IpXOi/    http://paste.aichallenge.org/kWo1R/
2011-11-12T23:48:35  <amstan> _flag: so.. what's your profile?
2011-11-12T23:48:45  <ChrisH_> janzert: yes, because it becomes much less likely that the others in front of you will get pulled into games at the rate they do when you're at the back of the queue
2011-11-12T23:49:00  <amstan> Extrarius: i like the last one
2011-11-12T23:49:01  <Extrarius> amstan: aanything like the cavernous maps you're trying to generate
2011-11-12T23:49:28  <janzert> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2143 is the only user left with user_id == submission_id :(
2011-11-12T23:49:44  <amstan> Extrarius: the first one's nice too, in the ammount of things you have
2011-11-12T23:49:47  *** Antimony <Antimony!~chatzilla@lawn-143-215-54-21.lawn.gatech.edu> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-12T23:49:51  <amstan> Extrarius: i just don't like the fine noise
2011-11-12T23:50:07  <Extrarius> ok
2011-11-12T23:51:01  <janzert> is that second one known to be divided in two?
2011-11-12T23:51:14  <ChrisH_> janzert: I was dropping too fast in the rankings, so I had to make an improvement.  ;)  I don't expect this submission to last for a long time though, it has known problems with timeouts, but I will still get useful feedback
2011-11-12T23:51:32  <amstan> _flag: so what's your user account fron tron?
2011-11-12T23:51:40  <amstan> contestbot: seen mleise
2011-11-12T23:51:40  <contestbot> amstan: mleise was last seen in #aichallenge 16 hours, 1 minute, and 4 seconds ago: <mleise> Also the engine does offer logging the bot input, yes. The switch is -I, I think (?)
2011-11-12T23:52:58  <Extrarius> amstan: how about http://paste.aichallenge.org/WzVth/ ?
2011-11-12T23:54:59  <Extrarius> amstan: and this: http://paste.aichallenge.org/fJeQR/ ?
2011-11-12T23:55:11  <amstan> Extrarius: how are you making these?
2011-11-12T23:55:14  <amstan> it looks painted in mspaint
2011-11-12T23:55:28  <janzert> Extrarius: not having connected hills is a known bug in your generator?
2011-11-12T23:55:29  <ChrisH_> janzert: It would seem that a more accurate next game estimate would be to use an interpolation between players/min when you're at the back of the queue and games/min when you're at the front.
2011-11-12T23:56:21  <Extrarius> janzert: I haven't bothered with connectivity yet, just working on style
2011-11-12T23:56:22  <janzert> ChrisH_: close, but based on percentage of how many players ahead of you and number of active players total
2011-11-12T23:56:27  <janzert> Extrarius: ok
2011-11-12T23:56:46  <janzert> since the queue size is much smaller than the number of active players now
2011-11-12T23:57:22  <ChrisH_> yeah, that makes sense
2011-11-12T23:57:33  <janzert> by active players here I mean submissions available for games not activated submissions
2011-11-12T23:57:45  <amstan> Extrarius: how are you doing this?
2011-11-12T23:57:55  <janzert> activated submissions == queue size of course
2011-11-12T23:58:59  <ChrisH_> yep, although when you get towards the front you're only worried about activated for seed selection, so it seems like a mixture of the two is neede maybe
2011-11-12T23:59:47  <amstan> a1k0n: feel free to link here now: http://tron.aichallenge.org/profile.php?user_id=2191
2011-11-12T23:59:49  <Extrarius> amstan: using the 'worm' method I described before - I make an empty map and make a 'worm' (essentially a circle) that does a random crawl (random walk, except that it's steering instead of picking a random direction) and after a few steps, spawn a new worm from the list of possible positions (which starts with some predefined points, and the midpoint and endpoint of each previous worm is
2011-11-12T23:59:49  <Extrarius> added to the list of spawn locations)
2011-11-12T23:59:50  <ChrisH_> janzert: it sounds like you've got it figured out though
