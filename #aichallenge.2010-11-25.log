2010-11-25T01:41:26  <rebelxt_> janzert: hey
2010-11-25T01:41:35  <janzert> yes?
2010-11-25T01:42:17  <rebelxt_> quick question on final tournament
2010-11-25T01:43:05  <rebelxt_> are you guys planning to limit games to top100 at some point? i'm afraid ratings are going to be very unstable if every account participates until the very end of the tourney
2010-11-25T01:43:29  <burny> why would that make it be any less stable?
2010-11-25T01:43:47  <janzert> I'm hoping it won't have to get all the way down to top 100 but yes the bottom ranks will be slowly eliminated
2010-11-25T01:44:19  <burny> should just automatically purge any submissions, that are identical to any other submissions
2010-11-25T01:44:20  <rebelxt_> burny, number of games between opponents determine how precise ELO scores are
2010-11-25T01:44:31  <burny> or have only 4bytes difference
2010-11-25T01:44:57  <burny> rebel: so you just mean.. that they won't be able to play as many games?
2010-11-25T01:45:32  <janzert> burny: yes, the bottom rankings just will play less games than top will end up with
2010-11-25T01:45:32  <rebelxt_> janzert: ok that's great. i noticed that it currently takes about 5 days for the submission to get a stable ELO score
2010-11-25T01:47:47  <janzert> rebelxt_: with the constant resubmission of opponents I think depending on where you are in the rankings it can be about impossible to get enough games that count for the rankings to settle down really well
2010-11-25T01:48:07  <janzert> near the top is probably actually the worst for this

2010-11-25T01:51:38  <rebelxt_> if you let top100 duke it out for just one hour, it appears that every bot would get about one game per minute, which should stabilize ratings really well (total is 4600 bots it appears)
2010-11-25T01:53:07  <rebelxt_> janzert: can i "donate" another EC2 server for the final tourney? it's already set up using the AMI you use

2010-11-25T01:56:41  <janzert> Just have to see how many workers the main server can end up feeding
2010-11-25T01:57:32  <rebelxt_> does main server pass bot binaries to the workers?

2010-11-25T01:57:54  <rebelxt_> more servers planned = awesome!
2010-11-25T01:58:11  <janzert> they are recompiled on the worker if it's a non-portable language but basically yes
2010-11-25T01:58:12  <burny> for more contests, I can get access to roughly 80 2Ghz 4gig ram systems, 12-16hours/day
2010-11-25T01:58:38  <janzert> burny: nice you should talk to j3camero about it
2010-11-25T01:59:46  <rebelxt_> i think eburnette has everyone beat with 1600 cores ;-)
2010-11-25T02:01:11  <rebelxt_> janzert: one potential thing to look into is spot pricing for the workers (unless you guys have reserved instances). i've been using it for the tcp server, and savings are great compared to normal rates
2010-11-25T02:01:36  <janzert> yeah, we've been using spot instances the whole time

2010-11-25T02:05:06  <McLeopold> hi
2010-11-25T02:05:25  <rebelxt_> just wrote a script for analyzing player stats on zeroviz. want it?
2010-11-25T02:05:30  <McLeopold> Do you have a good number for when you should not capture a growth one?
2010-11-25T02:05:41  <McLeopold> Yes
2010-11-25T02:06:48  <rebelxt_> http://pastebin.com/z0R3xJAC
2010-11-25T02:07:21  <rebelxt_> for instance:
2010-11-25T02:07:25  <rebelxt_> python parse_zero_compare.py rebelxt215 rebelxt216
2010-11-25T02:07:53  <rebelxt_> can pass one player, then it just does stats for that player, or can do comparison for 2+ players
2010-11-25T02:10:28  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: i only take growth into account indirectly.. i.e. looking what profit i get within a certain horizon. and i do have a threshold value which usually eliminates growth 1 planets unless they are really cheap and very close
2010-11-25T02:11:19  <rebelxt_> i hate having this threshold value but i tried to replace it with 100's lines of code and ended up with weaker bots..
2010-11-25T02:11:31  <McLeopold> Do you what your cutoff is?  I'm think 50ish
2010-11-25T02:11:43  <McLeopold> Which is 1/4 of the game.
2010-11-25T02:11:47  <rebelxt_> you mean horizon?

2010-11-25T02:11:57  <McLeopold> for growth 1, it's the same thing
2010-11-25T02:12:53  <rebelxt_> that's about right. mine changes but usually is a bit higher than 50, and is capped when getting close to 200
2010-11-25T02:13:58  <McLeopold> I'm seeing my bot take some 58+1 and 87+1 planets.
2010-11-25T02:14:13  <McLeopold> I've looked at mega1's bot, and we will lose a game rather than attempt it.
2010-11-25T02:14:20  <McLeopold> he will
2010-11-25T02:15:14  <rebelxt_> mine still loses some games due to resisting taking relatively cheap 1 or 2 growth :(
2010-11-25T02:16:02  <rebelxt_> 58+1 - mine would never touch this currently since max distance is 30
2010-11-25T02:16:24  <McLeopold> does that mean it wouldn't touch a 61+2?
2010-11-25T02:16:35  <burny> woot.. my ai is uber now..
2010-11-25T02:16:36  <burny> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8587255
2010-11-25T02:18:16  <rebelxt_> 61+2 is no go even it's within dist 2 from me. just above the threshold
2010-11-25T02:18:44  <McLeopold> I keep considering putting it in, but I hate to write code like that.
2010-11-25T02:18:56  <McLeopold> I'd feel better if a made a formula from something.
2010-11-25T02:19:09  <rebelxt_> yeah.. hope you have better luck not having a cut off like i do.. it really hurts sometimes

2010-11-25T02:39:07  <McLeopold> hmm. I'm doubting my chances for a top 10 then...
2010-11-25T02:41:06  <rebelxt_> well, looking at our earlier games, i think you are very close to getting there
2010-11-25T02:41:17  <McLeopold> But I lost a bunch
2010-11-25T02:43:53  <rebelxt_> can't win 'em all. we should get more games in so that you have a better idea. i should have another stable bot soon..
2010-11-25T02:44:28  <medrimonia> the level is going crazy^^
2010-11-25T02:45:08  <medrimonia> Everyone is trying to improve his bot

2010-11-25T02:46:32  <rebelxt_> i don't think we played many enough games to get a good picture.. and imho antbot is way stronger than rebelxt216

2010-11-25T02:49:51  <antimatroid1> and i'm eliminating my tree from trying to cancel moves they "make"
2010-11-25T02:50:10  <antimatroid1> it'll either work or fail miserably

2010-11-25T02:51:31  <medrimonia> and tcp is not for my connection...
2010-11-25T02:51:58  <medrimonia> depending of hours I've between a tenth and a half of times out
2010-11-25T02:51:59  <rebelxt_> ahh that's a bummer. maybe rent a server on EC2 for a few days? would only cost a few $

2010-11-25T09:54:00  <bhasker> #2 right now though
2010-11-25T09:54:05  <bhasker> but only 4 games
2010-11-25T09:55:00  <Mistmanov> yeah I noticed. but 6 submissions in one day, so that screws up the ranking

2010-11-25T09:55:35  <bhasker> well my new version seems to beat mega every now and then lol

2010-11-25T09:57:07  <Mistmanov> =) yeah, no one has written a bot that does perfectly on every map
2010-11-25T09:57:35  <Mistmanov> that's not what I expected btw. I would've thought that the top bot would just win all the time, every map
2010-11-25T09:57:46  <bhasker> yea this game is too complex
2010-11-25T09:57:51  <bhasker> probably with more time per turn
2010-11-25T09:57:53  <bhasker> that might be possible
2010-11-25T09:58:07  <bhasker> i think 1 second per turn is quite tight for this game to get every map right
2010-11-25T09:59:05  <Mistmanov> hmhm.. if you really want to calculate "so what happens in 30 turns when I do this and then this and he does this and..."
2010-11-25T09:59:16  <Mistmanov> 1 turn is not going to be enough

2010-11-25T17:11:54  <mega1> not because I think it's different, but because it's what I have available
2010-11-25T17:12:19  <rebelxt_> you are using LISP so likely not an issue. but i'm paranoid now
2010-11-25T17:12:20  <mega1> The considerable differences I attributed to the difference in cpu speed.

2010-11-25T17:17:55  <mega1> so is it a new bot?

2010-11-25T17:19:38  <mega1> did you find the games useful?
2010-11-25T17:19:54  <mega1> I guess we played enough on zeroviz too
2010-11-25T17:20:31  <rebelxt_> yeah i'm still replaying them - but only a few losses were obvious off by one errors on my part.
2010-11-25T17:22:05  <rebelxt_> yeah we got 400+ games on zeroviz! info overload

2010-11-25T18:25:03  <pgpaskar> depends on your definition of "easy" and what you want to do to exceed it
2010-11-25T18:25:07  <pgpaskar> here's an easy way:  while (true);
2010-11-25T18:25:07  <amstan> burny: while(1);
2010-11-25T18:25:10  * pgpaskar slaps amstan

2010-11-25T18:25:26  <amstan> pgpaskar: will true be defined?
2010-11-25T18:25:36  <burny> na, I mean.. are top bots having to do anythign remotely clever to avoid it?
2010-11-25T18:25:37  <pgpaskar> #DEFINE true !!!0
2010-11-25T18:25:46  <burny> or are most able to completely ignore it?
2010-11-25T18:25:56  <amstan> burny: i think they are
2010-11-25T18:26:10  <amstan> burny: last contest it was a requirement to have them
2010-11-25T18:26:18  <Error323> my avg turntime is 0.0003s
2010-11-25T18:26:36  <pgpaskar> that's because everyone last time in the top100 was basically minmaxing and were writing clever eval functions
2010-11-25T18:26:42  <pgpaskar> this time... such is not the case i think
2010-11-25T18:26:56  <burny> so, should be able to easily remain under, unless you screw up, or are doing something especially intensive?
2010-11-25T18:26:56  <Error323> the #1 is applying minimax with one ply
2010-11-25T18:27:08  <Error323> or basically generating actions and evaluating them

2010-11-25T18:49:50  <mega1> and how many maps?
2010-11-25T18:50:17  <burny> oh.. I have a question... how does the scoring for final work?
2010-11-25T18:51:11  <burny> like, is it based on elo, and we need to mostly beat bots on the same level.. or does how often we win/lose to weaker bots play a significant factor? etc.
2010-11-25T18:51:41  <Error323> burny: its based on elo
2010-11-25T18:51:56  <Error323> so losing to weaker bots will have a massive impat
2010-11-25T18:51:58  <Error323> impact*
2010-11-25T18:52:06  <burny> not if you don't play against weaker bots
2010-11-25T18:52:19  <Error323> opponents are chosen through a pareto distribution
2010-11-25T18:52:38  <Error323> which seems good to me
2010-11-25T18:53:32  <burny> if I have teh choice of losing to 5% of weak bots, 100% of the time, on 20% of maps.. or losing to 10% of good bots, 10% of the time, on 20% of maps..
2010-11-25T18:53:36  <burny> which should I choose?
2010-11-25T18:54:20  <burny> both result in 0.2% more losses.. but if I'm not likely to play against a weak bot(assuming my bot is good).. then who cares?
2010-11-25T18:55:28  <mega1> optimize for opponent near your current strength
2010-11-25T18:55:35  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-25T18:55:58  <Error323> such that you don't regres for opponents < then current strenght +)
2010-11-25T18:56:02  <burny> that means stuff like..
2010-11-25T18:56:14  <burny> assume my opponent doesn't send 100ships at my base, on the first frame

2010-11-25T20:53:07  * antimatroid1 perhaps spends a little too much time on the internet
2010-11-25T20:53:08  <napolitano> obviously not reddit.com
2010-11-25T20:53:22  <antimatroid1> yes reddit.com/r/programming
2010-11-25T20:53:37  <Zannick> i came here in sept from reddit
2010-11-25T20:53:53  <Zannick> there was another post recently, too
2010-11-25T20:54:40  <antimatroid1> yeah, there were a few posts in september, did you come from the premature or official one?
2010-11-25T20:55:00  <antimatroid1> i managed to see the one where someone spotted the site a week or two before it was even meant to go live
2010-11-25T20:55:24  <antimatroid1> then there was a bunch of people in here when the official opening was posted on reddit
2010-11-25T20:55:37  * antimatroid1 has been enslaved right since the start
2010-11-25T20:56:15  <Zannick> the premature one
2010-11-25T20:56:45  <Zannick> i have an account from before the official start date because i volunteered to help with testing
2010-11-25T20:57:05  <Zannick> and then i spent all my time contributing to the backend code rather than work on my own bot..
2010-11-25T20:58:19  <antimatroid1> yeah that's always an issue
2010-11-25T20:58:25  <antimatroid1> i sort of wish i hadn't spent time on the map generator
2010-11-25T20:58:29  <antimatroid1> but no one else was going to

2010-11-25T21:37:59  <antimatroid1> :)
2010-11-25T21:38:14  <antimatroid1> we need better competitors
2010-11-25T21:38:24  <antimatroid1> no offense, but it's a bit disappointing that someone could do that in a week or two
2010-11-25T21:38:36  <burny> a day really
2010-11-25T21:38:43  <burny> aside from what I did yesterday..
2010-11-25T21:38:49  <antimatroid1> yeah, oh well, next time
2010-11-25T21:38:52  <burny> I fixed a tiny bug this afternoon
2010-11-25T21:38:58  <antimatroid1> it's still way more competitive than the last contest
2010-11-25T21:39:01  <burny> and spent like 10minutes on the preliminary bot

2010-11-25T21:56:30  <nullkuhl> this may be off topic, but is anyone familiar with this problem, i have a pdf file that when i try to copy and paste any text from it, its pasted as scrambled text or white spaces, also using any pdf to text convertor it outputs empty or scrambled files, any idea ?
2010-11-25T21:57:34  <burny> it's probably intended to be that way
2010-11-25T21:57:42  <burny> security is one of pdf's only redeeming qualitys

2010-11-25T22:00:22  <nullkuhl> burny: any way to overcome that ? it seems to be more of an encoding problem

2010-11-25T22:02:14  <burny> that's not neccessarily what you're running into.. but it's for sure worth considering
2010-11-25T22:03:40  <nullkuhl> burny: its not that, actually the file was extracted from some 3dparty application, and currently thats the pdf file is only the place where the data exist, and now i cant copy the text from it :S   this explains my current situation accurately http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.lang.postscript/2010-05/msg00034.html
2010-11-25T22:04:03  <antimatroid1> lol, that bot fluked first 4 matches and is now only behind bocsi on tcp

2010-11-25T22:07:18  <antimatroid1> bah timeouts are the worst
2010-11-25T22:07:31  <nullkuhl> burny: i figured out that the problem is in the encoding, its custom from the page i linked you to above, however am really not sure how to fix that now.
2010-11-25T22:07:58  <burny> anti: I think timeout is what was making mine crash last night

2010-11-25T22:40:53  <antimatroid1> i'm looking forward to the contest
2010-11-25T22:41:02  <antimatroid1> the rankings are going to be all over the show i think
2010-11-25T22:41:08  <antimatroid1> it shall be exciting to watch
2010-11-25T22:42:58  <bhasker> yea i uploaded this version to official lets see where it settles
2010-11-25T22:43:17  <antimatroid1> i don't think there is any settling atm is there?
2010-11-25T22:43:27  <bhasker> that is true
2010-11-25T22:43:41  <bhasker> but my previous version was holding 40-50 for a few days straight
2010-11-25T22:43:50  <bhasker> so i am hoping this can settle somewhere around that regio
2010-11-25T22:44:00  <bhasker> seems to be doing decently on tcp

2010-11-25T22:48:59  <winexception> I just heard about this a couple days ago. The official tournament doesn't start until after the 27th, right?
2010-11-25T22:50:20  <burny> it ends on the 27th
2010-11-25T22:50:27  <burny> or rather..
2010-11-25T22:50:32  <burny> that's the deadline for entrys
2010-11-25T22:52:53  <winexception> I see. Thanks.
2010-11-25T22:53:04  <burny> is this a close game?

2010-11-25T22:54:50  <bhasker> so burny is your bot a heuristic bot
2010-11-25T22:55:04  <burny> not really
2010-11-25T22:55:11  <burny> it's an if else bot really
2010-11-25T22:55:23  <winexception> Wow. It looks like it.
2010-11-25T22:55:37  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-25T22:55:45  <bhasker> won't an if else bot be a heuristic?
2010-11-25T22:56:10  <burny> the only huristic I have, is determining how good owning one planet is, compared to another
2010-11-25T22:56:20  <burny> the rest is like...
2010-11-25T22:56:57  <burny> if(planet[a].canCapture(planet[b]) planet[a].attack(planet[b]);
2010-11-25T22:56:58  <burny> etc.
2010-11-25T22:57:13  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-25T22:57:20  <bhasker> rebelxt around?
2010-11-25T22:57:48  <burny> winexception: looks like what? a close game? or a huristic bot?
2010-11-25T22:58:06  <winexception> I wish i ran into this website awhile ago.
2010-11-25T22:58:18  <burny> ya, same.. just started last week :(

2010-11-25T23:13:53  <bhasker> malazan is my bot
2010-11-25T23:15:38  <bhasker> antimatroid you gotta watch this game http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1216297
2010-11-25T23:15:45  <winexception> bhasker, the game link you provided shows how your ai took over planets by flanking.
2010-11-25T23:16:11  <bhasker> hmm not sure what you mean by flanking? attacking on the sides?
2010-11-25T23:17:03  <winexception> Attacking while enemy fleets are leaving is what om trying to say.
2010-11-25T23:18:16  <bhasker> ah thats just a normal reaction of the bot
2010-11-25T23:18:27  <bhasker> as enemy leaves a planet it will create an attractive target
2010-11-25T23:18:35  <bhasker> so bot will automatically prefer to attack that
2010-11-25T23:18:49  <bhasker> the same as when i launch from my planets, enemy will tend to attack the planets i just launched from

2010-11-25T23:37:07  <bhasker> thats about it
