2010-11-02T01:24:52  <McLeopold> It's still very much broken.
2010-11-02T01:25:08  <McLeopold> Like, really really broken.
2010-11-02T01:25:22  <McLeopold> But it does do some cool things sometimes.
2010-11-02T01:25:32  <antimatroid> yeah, mines much the same i think
2010-11-02T01:26:07  <McLeopold> I think I turned off my forwarding somehow
2010-11-02T01:27:50  <McLeopold> That was one of the more interesting matches I've seen.
2010-11-02T01:32:06  <antimatroid> that's what i thought

2010-11-02T01:33:22  <McLeopold> but I sat on my ships in the back

2010-11-02T02:55:47  <janzert> still need to add new organizations manually though

2010-11-02T05:07:32  <antimatroid> and if i end up using mixed strategies i'll need them to implement them

2010-11-02T06:14:18  <Error323> nice
2010-11-02T06:14:23  <dmj111> that is true.  I was disappointed that there wasn't a real game there, since bocsimacko and have had so few.  Not that I think I have a chance, but I want to learn something from it.
2010-11-02T06:14:54  <dmj111> ("that is true" refers to the embarrassment part)
2010-11-02T06:15:25  <dmj111> But, I did think it was funny to imagine that my bot crapped out because it saw what was coming.
2010-11-02T06:16:05  <dmj111> "since bocsimacko _and I_ have had so few."  I need to quit typing at 6 in the morning.
2010-11-02T06:17:08  <antimatroid> yeah, whenever i play him it's over within 70 moves usually
2010-11-02T06:17:16  <antimatroid> my bot always does something his bot exploits the crap out of
2010-11-02T06:18:20  <dmj111> not only is his far better than mine, but what ever he does is the scissors to the paper my bot does.
2010-11-02T06:18:58  <dmj111> I had the same thing with rsergio's last submission.  our ratings were about the same, but his beat me about 10 time in a row..
2010-11-02T06:19:04  <antimatroid> i think i need to speed things up so i can consider more options from both players
2010-11-02T06:19:35  <Error323> oef
2010-11-02T06:19:38  <antimatroid> perfectly ranking so many bots is an impossible task, i think it's working reasonably well
2010-11-02T06:20:07  <antimatroid> compared to most competitions, we get a pretty good go at approximating perfect rankings
2010-11-02T06:20:55  <Error323> antimatroid: where are you ranked on tcp and official?
2010-11-02T06:21:04  <antimatroid> nothing on official atm
2010-11-02T06:21:08  <antimatroid> and tcp not well :P
2010-11-02T06:21:13  <Error323> oh
2010-11-02T06:21:30  <antimatroid> once upon a time i was in the top 10 on official
2010-11-02T06:21:45  <dmj111> yes, i think the ratings are working well.  Just saying that there are certain strategies that dominate others, even though both are about the same strength against everyone else.
2010-11-02T06:22:15  <Error323> well
2010-11-02T06:22:56  <Error323> That sounds valid to me dmj111
2010-11-02T06:23:14  <Error323> transitivity
2010-11-02T06:28:40  <antimatroid> you will never get non-cyclic ordering for bots in a comp like this
2010-11-02T06:28:47  <antimatroid> otherwise it'd be pretty easy to sort them

2010-11-02T06:56:31  <raedwulf> erm my calculations must be wrong then... how do you calculate it?

2010-11-02T06:58:17  <antimatroid> find max incoming, if that's <= neutral, neutral stays as is with ships -= maxincoming
2010-11-02T06:58:18  <antimatroid> if that's > neutral amount, if max=min incoming, neutral amount = 0, otherwise owner = max player and ships = max incoming - min(neutral amount, min incoming)

2010-11-02T06:59:15  <Migi32> max(neutral amount, min incoming) there at the end I think
2010-11-02T06:59:15  <antimatroid> it's a bit longer than probably necessary, i was trying to minimise the number of operations performed
2010-11-02T06:59:20  <Naktibalda> ships = max incoming - max(neutral amount, min incoming)
2010-11-02T06:59:32  <antimatroid> migi32: you're correct
2010-11-02T06:59:41  <raedwulf> oh ok
2010-11-02T06:59:50  <antimatroid> the posted code has it right

2010-11-02T07:18:19  <Migi32> antimatroid, most of what you have there is already in standard c++ though, std::max and std::accumulate (for the sum or the product)
2010-11-02T07:18:29  <Migi32> but I like the operator== for vectors
2010-11-02T07:18:35  <Migi32> not that I needed it yet, but still

2010-11-02T07:20:07  <antimatroid> i can't work out how to do []...[] indexing of tensors though
2010-11-02T07:20:15  <antimatroid> anyone know how to do that?

2010-11-02T10:09:23  <bhasker> his bot's trick gets him early expansion much faster

2010-11-02T10:09:36  <bhasker> i need to work that trick out

2010-11-02T11:20:51  <raedwulf> but mine is far more complex than that
2010-11-02T11:21:02  <raedwulf> but at the most basic level, it does that

2010-11-02T11:24:59  <Migi32> this made me assume you were flavor :P

2010-11-02T11:25:41  <demerzel_> he was a great test for my defenses
2010-11-02T11:26:00  <demerzel_> took me a while to get the calc for minimum needed to not lose my planets lol
2010-11-02T11:26:45  <Migi32> do you treat stream attacks different than normal attacks, btw?
2010-11-02T11:28:54  <demerzel_> i don't really treat attacks as anything other than deductions to my planet population
2010-11-02T11:29:20  <demerzel_> but to calculate how much you need to stop it from losing is more difficult when there's 20 turns to account for
2010-11-02T11:29:34  <demerzel_> or rather 20 turns with incoming

2010-11-02T12:05:21  <lavalamp_> It's mandatory, it's the last thing the move generator does for every move
2010-11-02T12:05:43  <JamesMG> ah, I see
2010-11-02T12:05:54  <lavalamp_> my goals are in levels and the tree searcher is allowed to mix and match some levels but others are mandatory

2010-11-02T12:08:23  <lavalamp_> And actually what I've got running there atm is just the move generator trying execute all its goals without any tree search

2010-11-02T12:10:39  <JamesMG> my best working code uses the planet closest to it's nearest enemy planet, and any planets that are
2010-11-02T12:10:46  <JamesMG> close enough for it to get to before the enemy supply it
2010-11-02T12:11:03  <JamesMG> of course, that code is bugged right now

2010-11-02T12:16:26  <JamesMG> oh
2010-11-02T12:16:42  <McLeopold> It's surprising he's number one and yet plays that type of game.
2010-11-02T12:16:52  <McLeopold> It's like defense doesn't matter.
2010-11-02T12:17:14  <McLeopold> He just assumes he will steamroll the opponent?
2010-11-02T12:17:25  <lavalamp_> I guess
2010-11-02T12:17:43  <lavalamp_> he didn't have to let himself get sniped is the weird thing
2010-11-02T12:17:53  <JamesMG> he had enough ships to counter snipe
2010-11-02T12:18:03  <lavalamp_> exactly
2010-11-02T12:18:15  <JamesMG> we would've traded those planets for a turn I think
2010-11-02T12:23:17  <mega1> I'll look into it :-)
2010-11-02T12:23:45  <McLeopold> oh, no, I think it's an enduring bug.  No need to fix it.

2010-11-02T12:37:47  <bhasker_> so question
2010-11-02T12:37:59  <bhasker_> lets say enemy launches 100 ships at your planet
2010-11-02T12:38:27  <bhasker_> and you have 20 right now, but not enough to counter it, but your growth will exceed the 100 before his ships hit
2010-11-02T12:38:35  <bhasker_> i mean the supporting planets
2010-11-02T12:38:42  <bhasker_> so you could keep the planet if you stream ships to it
2010-11-02T12:38:55  <bhasker_> the question is how do you compute for something like that
2010-11-02T12:39:00  <bhasker_> my bot is rather dumb that way
2010-11-02T12:39:19  <bhasker_> or will it never work,since enemy could counter the streamed ships?
2010-11-02T12:39:36  <bhasker_> my bot doesn't launch unless it has ships to counter the attack

2010-11-02T12:40:59  <demerzel_> bhasker: if the growth exceeds the ships then i would do nothing
2010-11-02T12:41:03  <lavalamp_> my bot looks into the future and calculates how many ships it will have at what point
2010-11-02T12:41:12  <bhasker_> no not the growth of the planet being attacked
2010-11-02T12:41:15  <lavalamp_> and sends ships at the last possible time
2010-11-02T12:41:17  <bhasker_> but probably the supporting planets
2010-11-02T12:41:36  <demerzel_> bhasker: then i would have already calc'd that and queued a future order ;)

2010-11-02T12:42:05  <demerzel_> queueing orders is tough
2010-11-02T12:42:08  <demerzel_> i'm still working out priorities
2010-11-02T12:42:19  <lavalamp_> I don't queue, I recalc every turn
2010-11-02T12:42:25  <bhasker_> yea same here
2010-11-02T12:42:30  <bhasker_> i never queue across turns
2010-11-02T12:42:32  <lavalamp_> but if you send at the last possible time it amounts to the same thing
2010-11-02T12:42:39  <demerzel_> sortof
2010-11-02T12:42:41  <bhasker_> not really there is a travel time
2010-11-02T12:42:52  <lavalamp_> I account for travel time
2010-11-02T12:43:18  <bhasker_> hmm
2010-11-02T12:43:44  <lavalamp_> only problem with what I do is that it can change its mind halfway through
2010-11-02T12:45:10  <JamesMG> I'm working out how to deal with mind changing right now too
2010-11-02T12:45:40  <lavalamp_> I figure I'm gonna concentrate on making good decisions initially

2010-11-02T12:46:02  <lavalamp_> then mind changing will be a feature and not a bug
2010-11-02T12:46:33  <bhasker_> well i just force it to consider planets which have attacks underway before other planets
2010-11-02T12:46:42  <bhasker_> so if it can complete the order then it will
2010-11-02T12:46:47  <bhasker_> otherwise it will go through the rest
2010-11-02T12:47:39  <lavalamp_> mine looks ahead for planets that will be less expensive at some point in the future, which handles sniping and syncing up with my prior orders
2010-11-02T12:48:07  <demerzel_> bhasker_: your weakness there is if there's a higher priority eg defense that you are launching out anyway for lesser gain
2010-11-02T12:49:36  <demerzel_> i tried that already
2010-11-02T12:49:45  <demerzel_> but you are correct in the fact that followthrough is difficult
2010-11-02T12:51:50  <bhasker_> well i tried various strategies
2010-11-02T12:51:57  <bhasker_> defense first has its drawbacks
2010-11-02T12:52:06  <bhasker_> especially when you launch a massive attack
2010-11-02T12:52:14  <bhasker_> the way i structure it
2010-11-02T12:52:30  <bhasker_> i consider my planets and enemy planets at same priority as long as they have the same growth rate
2010-11-02T12:52:41  <bhasker_> only neutrals get prioritized lower
2010-11-02T12:52:45  <bhasker_> unless they are under attack
2010-11-02T12:52:54  <bhasker_> in which case i prioritize them a little higher than other neutrals
2010-11-02T12:53:13  <bhasker_> this seems to work reasonably well to ensure that i complete launches
2010-11-02T12:59:22  <Error323> mm
2010-11-02T12:59:38  <Error323> so you attack before defense
2010-11-02T13:00:15  <bhasker_> nope both are same priority
2010-11-02T13:00:24  <bhasker_> as long as they are equal growth planets
2010-11-02T13:00:42  <bhasker_> i think i would defend first actually
2010-11-02T13:00:47  <bhasker_> for equal growth
2010-11-02T13:01:36  <Error323> wuuut
2010-11-02T13:01:41  <Error323> new valuefunction is doing nice
2010-11-02T13:01:54  <Error323> playing with that function is very, very usefull =)
2010-11-02T13:02:31  <Error323> ah ok
2010-11-02T13:02:48  <Error323> mmmm
2010-11-02T13:02:52  <Error323> i should do that aswell
2010-11-02T13:02:59  <Error323> currently all defense is before all attack
2010-11-02T13:03:21  <Error323> instead of using priorities
2010-11-02T13:03:23  <bhasker_> all defense is not useful
2010-11-02T13:03:29  <bhasker_> you may end up defending a 1 growth
2010-11-02T13:03:37  <bhasker_> when you could have attacked a 5 growth enemy
2010-11-02T13:03:40  <demerzel_> i still maintain there are so few circumstances where defense is not useful it's more of a pain to implement it as optional
2010-11-02T13:03:51  <demerzel_> assuming of course you aren't taking planets behind enemy lines
2010-11-02T13:04:14  <Error323> indd
2010-11-02T13:04:44  <bhasker_> the problem with defending first also happens when you launch massive attacks
2010-11-02T13:04:51  <bhasker_> and enemy counters with attacks
2010-11-02T13:04:57  <bhasker_> now if you always defend first
2010-11-02T13:05:04  <bhasker_> you would end up sending all the ships bac
2010-11-02T13:05:06  <demerzel_> in order to make a defense not useful it must not expose currently covered planets, have so little growth that you have the ability to counter the loss by taking another even losing travle time
2010-11-02T13:05:08  <bhasker_> when they reach the end
2010-11-02T13:05:19  <bhasker_> instead of swapping bases
2010-11-02T13:05:35  <demerzel_> and all defense losses are 1:1
2010-11-02T13:05:43  <demerzel_> so it's a rare circumstance that is not optimal
2010-11-02T13:06:13  <Error323> yaeh
2010-11-02T13:06:22  <Error323> i knew it was stupid >_>
2010-11-02T13:06:28  <Error323> this is what i see in a lot of games
2010-11-02T13:06:30  <Error323> im winning
2010-11-02T13:06:42  <Error323> and then i start defending crap insttead of keep going
2010-11-02T13:06:45  <bhasker_> another reason why i removed all preference for enemy planets closer to mine
2010-11-02T13:06:52  <bhasker_> i go for whichever planet i think i can acquire
2010-11-02T13:07:11  <bhasker_> even if its in the middle of the enemy base
2010-11-02T13:07:13  <demerzel_> Error323: if you're winning how is this a bad thing
2010-11-02T13:07:19  <bhasker_> cause you lose travel time
2010-11-02T13:07:25  <bhasker_> and growth
2010-11-02T13:07:31  <bhasker_> while enemy is busy taking over your base
2010-11-02T13:07:42  <bhasker_> your ships are hanging in mid air doing nothing
2010-11-02T13:07:55  <Error323> because eventually i lose
2010-11-02T13:08:04  <demerzel_> well maybe you should defend them instead of launching all your ships ;)
2010-11-02T13:08:09  <bhasker_> the point is
2010-11-02T13:08:18  <bhasker_> you launched a big attack to take on an enemy planet
2010-11-02T13:08:24  <bhasker_> but enemy instead of defending
2010-11-02T13:08:27  <bhasker_> counter attacks all your planets
2010-11-02T13:08:29  <bhasker_> or a bunch of them
2010-11-02T13:08:31  <bhasker_> what do you do?
2010-11-02T13:08:53  <demerzel_> nothing because i already calc'd how much i need to hold back and didn't launc those
2010-11-02T13:10:10  <bhasker_> then you would never launch big attacks in close matches
2010-11-02T13:10:16  <demerzel_> that's true
2010-11-02T13:10:26  <demerzel_> that's how you lose
2010-11-02T13:10:30  <bhasker_> not really
2010-11-02T13:10:33  <bhasker_> i have won a bunch of them
2010-11-02T13:10:45  <demerzel_> well it depends on a lot of factors obv
2010-11-02T13:10:50  <demerzel_> but if the enemy holds back enough to defend at all times
2010-11-02T13:10:54  <demerzel_> your attack will be ineffective
2010-11-02T13:11:07  <demerzel_> if you both kamikaze each other then whoever has the better attack algorithm will win

2010-11-02T13:12:00  <demerzel_> yea it depends

2010-11-02T13:12:11  <bhasker_> usually they counter
2010-11-02T13:12:24  <demerzel_> i wonder how many people calc enemy reinforcement possibility
2010-11-02T13:12:28  <demerzel_> or just send a flat % on top or what
2010-11-02T13:12:39  <Error323> i tried that
2010-11-02T13:12:42  <Error323> but it horribly fails
2010-11-02T13:12:50  <demerzel_> i used to send over the maximum possible enemy reinforcement

2010-11-02T13:13:35  <davidd> from the official site?
2010-11-02T13:13:46  <bhasker_> so i usuall launch enough to take over most of the planets nearby
2010-11-02T13:13:49  <bhasker_> otherwise i don'
2010-11-02T13:14:01  <bhasker_> though i don't account very well for fleets in flight
2010-11-02T13:14:03  <bhasker_> between the planets
2010-11-02T13:14:09  <bhasker_> so i end up underestimating it a bit
2010-11-02T13:14:14  <bhasker_> and attacks can fail
2010-11-02T13:14:21  <demerzel_> my attacks never fail
2010-11-02T13:14:24  <demerzel_> but they are quite few in quantity
2010-11-02T13:14:43  <demerzel_> i am sure there is a medium between 1+ pop and 1+pop + all enemy reinf possibility
2010-11-02T13:14:59  <demerzel_> i have yet to find it though
2010-11-02T13:15:13  <bhasker_> yea
2010-11-02T13:15:31  <bhasker_> so one thing i changed is i used to double count enemy reinforcements when launching from multiple planets
2010-11-02T13:15:35  <bhasker_> i stopped doing that
2010-11-02T13:15:48  <bhasker_> so its a little closer to optimal
2010-11-02T13:15:50  <bhasker_> but not there yet
2010-11-02T13:16:06  <bhasker_> though most of my losses are not due to bad attacks

2010-11-02T13:16:11  <bhasker_> but usually due to bad starts
2010-11-02T13:16:23  <demerzel_> doesn't launch unless it can overage every possible enemy ship
2010-11-02T13:16:34  <demerzel_> i am trying to figure out if i want to do that for this one or not
2010-11-02T13:17:05  <bhasker_> the problem i have with launching exact ships

2010-11-02T13:17:10  <bhasker_> they just sit

2010-11-02T13:21:33  <bhasker_> its embarrasing , its like he gives my bot a schooling

2010-11-02T13:24:07  <Error323> lol
2010-11-02T13:24:28  <raedwulf> i need to write a special function "beat_bocksimacko()"
2010-11-02T13:25:34  <raedwulf> but wait... what about the 2000 others above me
2010-11-02T13:26:17  <Error323> well when you got that function
2010-11-02T13:26:24  <Error323> don't worrry bout the other 2000
2010-11-02T13:27:47  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-11-02T13:28:01  <raedwulf> learning some haskell at the moment
2010-11-02T13:28:13  <raedwulf> if i knew enough haskell might have been idea to write my bot in that
2010-11-02T13:28:31  <Error323> i never touched that
2010-11-02T13:28:43  <raedwulf> might know enough by the time the competition completes
2010-11-02T13:28:45  <raedwulf> lol
2010-11-02T13:29:01  <raedwulf> its a functional language, its pretty awesome

2010-11-02T13:37:44  <decipher> hey guys i have a quick question: if i have an enemy fleet heading towards my planet or any other neutral planet how can i figure out how many turns he has left to reach his destination,(aka distance of fleet to destination planet) i used pw.getFleet(a).turnsRemaining() function returns 0?
2010-11-02T13:38:08  <McLeopold_> decipher: it shouldn't return zero
2010-11-02T13:38:25  <McLeopold_> what language?
2010-11-02T13:38:28  <decipher> java
2010-11-02T13:39:07  <McLeopold_> hmm
2010-11-02T13:39:19  <decipher> i'm storing the turns remaining into a separate wrapper function that has dest,source,ships,and turns remaining
2010-11-02T13:39:19  <McLeopold_> Did you introduce a bug in the game start parser?
2010-11-02T13:39:55  <Naktibalda> decipher: then you have to debug your own code
2010-11-02T13:40:24  <McLeopold_> the turn remaining comes to you as a string in the game state and the beginning of the turn
2010-11-02T13:40:25  <decipher> sorry for the paste
2010-11-02T13:40:29  <decipher> else if (pw.GetFleet(a).Owner() == 2){                 Attack att = new Attack(pw.GetFleet(a).SourcePlanet(),pw.GetFleet(a).DestinationPlanet(),pw.GetFleet(a).NumShips(),pw.GetFleet(a).TurnsRemaining());
2010-11-02T13:40:37  <McLeopold_> It's a matter of parsing and storing
2010-11-02T13:40:38  <demerzel_> decipher: pastebin.com
2010-11-02T13:40:41  <decipher> kk
2010-11-02T13:40:42  <McLeopold_> Should be easy
2010-11-02T13:40:46  <decipher> ill use paste bin
2010-11-02T13:41:03  <decipher> http://pastebin.com/t68J7nBm
2010-11-02T13:41:04  <McLeopold_> yeah, then we get some indentation as well
2010-11-02T13:41:49  <demerzel_> that's a lot of ()s
2010-11-02T13:41:55  <demerzel_> gotta love the starter pack
2010-11-02T13:42:26  <lavalamp_> TurnsRemaining should never be 0, as the engine would have applied it already
2010-11-02T13:42:52  <demerzel_> i don't see anything wrong with it but i don't remember how the starter pack classes work
2010-11-02T13:43:09  <demerzel_> your problem is in turns remaining anyway not that
2010-11-02T13:43:26  <McLeopold_> paste in your parsing function
2010-11-02T13:44:00  <demerzel_> not parse - your wrapper function you mentioned
2010-11-02T13:44:32  <demerzel_> unless you're taking it directly from parse lol
2010-11-02T13:44:33  <decipher> no what maybe im writing to my file stupidly
2010-11-02T13:44:39  <decipher> no what

2010-11-02T13:44:47  <decipher> i must be parsing it wrong
2010-11-02T13:44:49  <decipher> lol
2010-11-02T13:45:21  <demerzel_> write parse functions once and never touch again is my advice lol
2010-11-02T13:45:29  <decipher> i have a function that calculates exactly how many ships you need to leave on if you have multiple planets attacking you i needed to store each fleet turns remaning
2010-11-02T13:45:50  <decipher> let me fix it up and ill get back to you

2010-11-02T13:47:19  <raedwulf> decipher: thats what im doing
2010-11-02T13:47:32  <raedwulf> but i've not tested it yet
2010-11-02T13:47:40  <raedwulf> well its "vaguely" what im doing
2010-11-02T13:47:45  <demerzel_> you didn't rewrite it raed?
2010-11-02T13:47:58  <raedwulf> rewrite it?
2010-11-02T13:48:05  <decipher> i have this white board you should see this algorithmn
2010-11-02T13:48:08  <demerzel_> you are modifying the starter pack or your own code
2010-11-02T13:48:18  <raedwulf> my own code, there's no starter pack for C ^^
2010-11-02T13:48:25  <demerzel_> well c++ i guess
2010-11-02T13:48:39  <demerzel_> but yea i did too
2010-11-02T13:48:40  <raedwulf> yea, but you have to rewrite the C++ code because it uses the c++ stdlib
2010-11-02T13:48:50  <raedwulf> no classes at all
2010-11-02T13:48:52  <raedwulf> :P
2010-11-02T13:49:04  <raedwulf> just a bunch of structs in my code
2010-11-02T13:49:04  <decipher> i have an individual leave behind percentage for every planet i own, if it can defend it self then it leaves the min amount of planets on and uses teh rest to attack else it attacks some other planet and scatters leaving only a few ships to grow and absorb their fleets
2010-11-02T13:49:20  <decipher> :D
2010-11-02T13:49:22  <demerzel_> decipher: if you're that serious i'd create your own planet structs
2010-11-02T13:49:26  <raedwulf> yea, mine is more precisely defined than that
2010-11-02T13:49:29  <raedwulf> im hoping it will work ok
2010-11-02T13:49:49  <decipher> dem i did but in java there objects not structs
2010-11-02T13:50:00  <demerzel_> decipher: classes objects structs whatever you wanna call them ;)
2010-11-02T13:50:05  <decipher> ahahaha
2010-11-02T13:50:09  <decipher> :P
2010-11-02T13:50:31  <decipher> its killing my brain thou because so much lil tweaking
2010-11-02T13:50:41  <demerzel_> the starter pack is torture to modify for me
2010-11-02T13:50:47  <demerzel_> clean slate every time
2010-11-02T13:51:13  <demerzel_> test out your theories on starter then rewrite with the ones that work :)
2010-11-02T13:51:24  <decipher> btw since im here i might as well ask you guys, whats the best way of testing a java jar my way is the worse im individually going map by map bot by bot investigating the results i wanna play a 1000 matches so i can get better statistics
2010-11-02T13:51:48  <demerzel_> take the source for one of the game engines and attach your bot as a class
2010-11-02T13:51:53  <demerzel_> the java game engines obv
2010-11-02T13:52:01  <demerzel_> just call it directly instead of sandboxing
2010-11-02T13:52:20  <decipher> oh ok modify the game engine it self
2010-11-02T13:52:26  <demerzel_> i would since it's already java
2010-11-02T13:52:30  <decipher> shouldn't be that hard
2010-11-02T13:52:51  <demerzel_> the way i did it to avoid changing parsing functions is just make a static string for input
2010-11-02T13:52:57  <decipher> what kinda ai heuristic you doing or meta heurisitic
2010-11-02T13:53:03  <demerzel_> and have the sandbox change that
2010-11-02T13:53:04  <decipher> yeah
2010-11-02T13:53:17  <demerzel_> the parser gets the string and what put it there is irrelevant
2010-11-02T13:54:31  <demerzel_> decipher: they're al heuristic afaik
2010-11-02T13:54:34  <demerzel_> all*
2010-11-02T13:55:16  <decipher> afaik?
2010-11-02T13:55:35  <demerzel_> as far as i know
2010-11-02T13:55:44  <decipher> oh
2010-11-02T13:55:48  <demerzel_> some stubby attempts at minimax with heuristic eval
2010-11-02T13:55:50  <decipher> hmm new lingo i didn't know ahha
2010-11-02T13:56:05  <demerzel_> the new #1 guy might have something better tho ;)
2010-11-02T13:56:06  <decipher> lol :D sounds like my prog kinda
2010-11-02T13:56:32  <decipher> my turns is still giving zero let me post little more
2010-11-02T13:57:25  <demerzel_> just paste all relevant bits into pastebin
2010-11-02T13:57:33  <demerzel_> i guarantee you nobody is gonna steal it here hehe
2010-11-02T13:58:57  <decipher> http://pastebin.com/Tss629GK
2010-11-02T13:59:04  <decipher> the bottom is where i write to file
2010-11-02T13:59:25  <decipher> test is to just grab one of my objects values and print it to file to see what turns returns
2010-11-02T14:01:20  <demerzel_> so what is it doing
2010-11-02T14:01:27  <demerzel_> i don't even see turnsremaining now lol
2010-11-02T14:01:51  <lavalamp_> remind us what the problem is again?
2010-11-02T14:03:12  <decipher> ahha
2010-11-02T14:03:13  <decipher> ok
2010-11-02T14:03:27  <decipher> so ignore anythign that says owner == 1 this is all bout the enemy right now
2010-11-02T14:04:18  <decipher> im going through all teh enemy fleets storing a new object an array with its desitinatin,source,ships,and remaining turns, then i calculate a leave behind percentage that should leave exactly how many ships to defend my self, but turns when i print it and use it comes out as zero
2010-11-02T14:04:34  <McLeopold_> decipher: I would suggest focussing on individual maps and tweaking for perfect play on them.
2010-11-02T14:04:53  <McLeopold_> you must make sure to pick 4 or 5 very different maps.
2010-11-02T14:05:14  <McLeopold_> I use map 1, 5, 7, 30 adn 64.
2010-11-02T14:05:28  <demerzel_> decipher: so you're storing an Attack class object in enemyDest[enemyCount] = att right?
2010-11-02T14:05:35  <decipher> yeah thats why i need the turns function based on size of map if the player rushing me i need ot know how far the fleet away from me so i can leave a certain amount of ships on and send the rest
2010-11-02T14:05:43  <decipher> yeah dem
2010-11-02T14:05:43  <demerzel_> i don't know what an Attack object is is that standard starter?
2010-11-02T14:06:00  <decipher> its a new class i made ill paste
2010-11-02T14:06:25  <decipher> http://pastebin.com/z5fttfyZ
2010-11-02T14:06:46  <decipher> its a wrapper object allows me to have one value that stores many
2010-11-02T14:06:52  <decipher> like a struct
2010-11-02T14:06:55  <demerzel_> btw you don't need to declare Attack att = new Attack() then go enemyDest[blah] = att
2010-11-02T14:07:03  <demerzel_> you can just declare it directly
2010-11-02T14:07:07  <demerzel_> ie enemydest[blah] = new attack()
2010-11-02T14:07:27  <decipher> yeah i do
2010-11-02T14:07:37  <demerzel_> heh
2010-11-02T14:07:39  <demerzel_> that was easy
2010-11-02T14:07:41  <demerzel_> turnsLeft = 0;
2010-11-02T14:07:42  <decipher> in java i need to make a new instance of the object or it will just overwrite
2010-11-02T14:07:46  <demerzel_> should be turnsLeft = t
2010-11-02T14:07:55  <decipher> ooo where
2010-11-02T14:07:58  <demerzel_> line 16
2010-11-02T14:08:20  <decipher> wtf
2010-11-02T14:08:26  <decipher> why does my default constructor
2010-11-02T14:08:26  <Error323> bhasker_: ur there?
2010-11-02T14:08:28  <decipher> have 0
2010-11-02T14:08:33  <decipher> and so does my main constructor
2010-11-02T14:08:39  <decipher> EVERYBODY GIVE DEM A AROUND APPLAUSE
2010-11-02T14:08:42  <Error323> did you apply my bot yet?
2010-11-02T14:08:44  <bhasker_> yup
2010-11-02T14:09:07  <decipher> thanks man you might of just saved me stupid amount of hours and writing to files debugging shit lol
2010-11-02T14:09:09  <demerzel_> default constructor is fine but i don't know why it's necessary
2010-11-02T14:09:15  <decipher> its not
2010-11-02T14:09:15  <lavalamp_> ok someone pointed out line 16, lol
2010-11-02T14:09:17  <demerzel_> java defaults ints to 0 anyway doesn't it
2010-11-02T14:09:19  <decipher> just good programming practice
2010-11-02T14:09:31  <decipher> lol i cant believe i had line 16

2010-11-02T14:33:52  <rebelxt> mega1: hey there
2010-11-02T14:34:01  <rebelxt> wonder if you ever been asked why your bot starts sending fleets in somewhat random direction towards the end of the game
2010-11-02T14:34:37  <rebelxt> wondering if it's fireworks mode or a side effect of ur algorithm ;-)
2010-11-02T14:34:57  <mega1> because the evaluation function doesn't care anymore
2010-11-02T14:35:33  <rebelxt> haha, got it
2010-11-02T14:35:39  <Commandir> McLeopold, without knowing the exact distances, my gut feeling is that it's a bad move.
2010-11-02T14:35:53  <bhasker_> yea and you never sent any further ships to it
2010-11-02T14:36:02  <bhasker_> i think if you had been streaming to it
2010-11-02T14:36:05  <rebelxt> i have something similar, except for i don't take any action if score is below certain threshold..
2010-11-02T14:36:05  <bhasker_> you might have held it

2010-11-02T14:41:19  <Commandir> I think the best first move, is to move all 100 to the 2 planet, to position yourself for countering whatever the opponent does
2010-11-02T14:41:52  <Commandir> but difficult move for a bot to find probably
2010-11-02T14:42:26  <rabidus> HEI KEBABILLE NYT

2010-11-02T14:44:03  <McLeopold_> Now, I'm thinking I couldn't have held.
2010-11-02T14:46:03  <McLeopold_> Nope, I couldn't.  And I now know why my bot made the mistake...

2010-11-02T15:59:25  <raedwulf> too much bloat
2010-11-02T15:59:29  <raedwulf> yea
2010-11-02T15:59:41  <raedwulf> i was planning that with this but i wanted to inline too much

2010-11-02T16:00:09  <raedwulf> probably i should have skipped adding back references

2010-11-02T20:15:43  <demerzel_> i think when i have a running bot i'll fully convert it to C

2010-11-02T20:16:06  <demerzel_> only thing i use from c++ is references and classes - easily changed to pointers and structs
2010-11-02T20:17:17  <phreeza> can c structs have member functions? i'm not even sure
2010-11-02T20:17:20  <phreeza> been a while
2010-11-02T20:17:27  <demerzel_> yup
2010-11-02T20:18:00  <demerzel_> i get that c++ is easier on devs but the reason i love it is because i can use oop easier while still using all the same c shit
2010-11-02T20:18:04  <phreeza> sure?
2010-11-02T20:18:07  <demerzel_> sites like parashift annoy me
2010-11-02T20:18:26  <demerzel_> yea i am sure
2010-11-02T20:18:34  <phreeza> don't yoiu have to do something slightly contrived like functiuon pointers?
2010-11-02T20:18:54  <demerzel_> oh wait no you're right
2010-11-02T20:19:11  <demerzel_> namespaces and then the "functions" are pointers to globals in namespaces
2010-11-02T20:19:16  <demerzel_> been a while
2010-11-02T20:19:21  <phreeza> :)
2010-11-02T20:19:35  <phreeza> ah yea that sounds right
2010-11-02T20:20:30  <demerzel_> i obv prefer member functions but the chance to be esoteric for a few function pointers is sounds worthwhile lol
2010-11-02T20:21:39  <demerzel_> i was gonna try lisp but my bot sucks too bad to go running off to a completely new lang

2010-11-02T22:34:41  <lavalamp_> on the other 5 it plays horribly...
2010-11-02T22:37:16  <sigh> heh, I've had that before
2010-11-02T22:38:38  <sigh> really hard to find strategies that work all the time
2010-11-02T22:39:42  <lavalamp_> more like not all maps have neutrals that trigger my horrible horrible bugs
2010-11-02T22:40:00  <sigh> 0 growth neutrals? :P
2010-11-02T22:40:03  <Zannick> more like time to make a hybrid bot
2010-11-02T22:40:22  <sigh> Zannick: that just introduces new problems :P

2010-11-02T22:41:06  <sigh> btw, lavalamp_, is dailyjoseki.com your site?
2010-11-02T22:41:12  <lavalamp_> no, I have a line to ignore +0 neutrals
2010-11-02T22:41:17  <lavalamp_> sigh: yes
2010-11-02T22:41:45  <lavalamp_> are you on the go (lang) mailing list or the go (game) forum? :)
2010-11-02T22:42:33  <sigh> nah, I saw the post in the forum about the go language and had a look at the starter pack and saw your email :P
2010-11-02T22:42:41  <lavalamp_> I am totally neglecting my website for this, hehe
2010-11-02T22:42:42  <lavalamp_> ah ok
2010-11-02T22:42:53  <sigh> so is your site like a joseki dictionary?
2010-11-02T22:43:13  <lavalamp_> yes, I build a tree from pro games
2010-11-02T22:43:49  <sigh> cool, have you seen kombilo, it can do something similar
2010-11-02T22:45:25  <lavalamp_> sigh: I explain a little bit about it here: http://www.lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=22211
2010-11-02T22:45:48  <lavalamp_> My site is cooler than kombilo ^^
2010-11-02T22:46:15  <lavalamp_> it answers the question "when pros play this what does the rest of the board look like" at a glance
2010-11-02T22:46:25  <sigh> yeah, that's cool :)
2010-11-02T22:46:38  <lavalamp_> I take it you must play go?
2010-11-02T22:47:03  <sigh> yeah, although I've not played much recently >.>
2010-11-02T22:50:30  <sigh> how does your site decide when to stop displaying moves?
2010-11-02T22:50:45  <lavalamp_> When no two pros play the same thing
2010-11-02T22:51:03  <sigh> hmm... but that's not necessarily the end of the line
2010-11-02T22:51:26  <lavalamp_> no... and I have some features scheduled to show a few more moves after that
2010-11-02T22:51:46  <sigh> ah, cool
2010-11-02T22:51:51  <lavalamp_> but not implemented yet and definitely won't be this month...
2010-11-02T22:52:10  <lavalamp_> hm, I think I broke something
2010-11-02T22:53:36  <antimatroid> move selection is tricky business :(
2010-11-02T22:54:10  <sigh> there's too many of them :(
2010-11-02T22:56:09  <antimatroid> that's not my issue
2010-11-02T22:56:18  <antimatroid> it's so hard to even pick out moves and play them against each other
2010-11-02T22:56:39  <sigh> what do you mean, exactly?
2010-11-02T22:56:46  <antimatroid> do i pick a move for a destination planet entirely into the future, or just to when i'd want to take it, and then it's just plain messy to work out claiming it into the future
2010-11-02T22:57:06  <antimatroid> that's if the ownership is currently expected to change multiple times
2010-11-02T22:57:16  <sigh> that sounds confusing
2010-11-02T22:57:52  <antimatroid> i have no idea how to do 2 way combat resolution for future states and still get end states that evaluate as i'd like
2010-11-02T22:57:54  <sigh> lavalamp: are you lavalamp on KGS too?
2010-11-02T22:58:17  <antimatroid> i can just stop sending voided fleets, but then the game state isn't really showing hte result of the moves to get there

2010-11-02T22:59:06  <sigh> what's hard about combat resolution?
2010-11-02T22:59:23  <demerzel_> hmm i have no idea why my bot streams now lol
2010-11-02T22:59:43  <demerzel_> that's what happens when you abstract too much haha
2010-11-02T22:59:56  <sigh> demerzel_: streams?
2010-11-02T23:00:13  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=830091
2010-11-02T23:00:39  <antimatroid> sigh: if have a tree making future moves from both players, one of their future moves might render one of my other future moves useless, so do i just not send them anymore and still consider the "move to have been made" inside that tree
2010-11-02T23:00:57  <antimatroid> and "moves" might be made at different times and from different sources, it just has one destination
2010-11-02T23:01:16  <antimatroid> inside that node**/branch
2010-11-02T23:01:18  <sigh> ...that sounds complicated :(
2010-11-02T23:01:31  <antimatroid> hence me having no idea how to do it :P
2010-11-02T23:01:49  <antimatroid> it's very hard to do future moves from both players and resolve it properly
2010-11-02T23:03:03  <sigh> I just recalculate the future states for a planet when I add a new fleet... if it becomes a bottleneck then I'll think about more efficient updates
2010-11-02T23:03:43  <sigh> *recalcuate all future states
2010-11-02T23:04:08  <antimatroid> yeah, so do i, but you arne't doing moves from them yet are you?
2010-11-02T23:04:49  <antimatroid> in my first layer i might tell myself to send 30 ships from planet 1 at time 14, but then they might send a fleet to planet 1 causing it to have less than 30 ships there at time 14, so i can't actually send that anymore
2010-11-02T23:05:01  <sigh> antimatroid: I have delayed moves, so sure
2010-11-02T23:05:12  <sigh> I don't have any lookahead, though
2010-11-02T23:05:42  <antimatroid> i'm talking about strictly inside one turn too
2010-11-02T23:05:50  <antimatroid> i'm not trying to keep information between turns anymore
2010-11-02T23:05:57  <antimatroid> i didn't trust myself not to fuck it up
2010-11-02T23:06:08  <sigh> I don't keep info between turns either
2010-11-02T23:06:39  <sigh> but if I decide to make a delayed move, my current state is updated so processing down the track knows about it
2010-11-02T23:07:06  <antimatroid> i don't want to know in the future what i planned to do in the past, the game state will be different because of the moves they make
2010-11-02T23:07:14  <antimatroid> what i do want to do is model both players when making my decisions
2010-11-02T23:07:49  <sigh> yeah, that's quite complex
2010-11-02T23:07:52  <antimatroid> and i want both players being able to send ships they currently have from any time point

2010-11-02T23:09:40  <antimatroid> the idea is sound, doing it without bugs is just stupidly hard
2010-11-02T23:09:47  <sigh> haha
2010-11-02T23:10:36  <antimatroid> my current way around it is to pick moves for each player individually, then when i make my zero sum game only implement new moves and run the funal states before evaluating them
2010-11-02T23:10:41  <antimatroid> but it's over the top and bleh
2010-11-02T23:11:21  <antimatroid> my functions are way too inefficient too, i need to speed things up if i want to look at enough things to make smart moves

2010-11-02T23:33:13  <antimatroid> when looking at the ships the enemy has, do you assume they perfectly predicted your move or responded?

2010-11-02T23:50:40  <demerzel_> how long do you guys pause between tcp games
2010-11-02T23:50:49  <demerzel_> i'm pausing 5 seconds but it doesn't seem to work
2010-11-02T23:50:53  <demerzel_> *all the time
2010-11-02T23:52:06  <bhasker> pausing doesn't make much difference
2010-11-02T23:52:19  <bhasker> since the server waits to match you against other folks of similar rating
2010-11-02T23:52:25  <sigh> yeah, you shouldn't need to pause
2010-11-02T23:52:29  <demerzel_> well if i didn't pause it never let me back in immediately
2010-11-02T23:52:36  <bhasker> hmm i have never had that problme
2010-11-02T23:52:40  <demerzel_> would hang in the receive state
2010-11-02T23:52:43  <bhasker> i almost always get a game after a few seconds
2010-11-02T23:53:00  <demerzel_> oh oh you are using the tcp game manager
2010-11-02T23:53:06  <demerzel_> i coded socket directly into the bot
2010-11-02T23:56:33  <bhasker> i am just using the tcp client
2010-11-02T23:56:44  <bhasker> didnt code it into the bot
2010-11-02T23:58:20  <bhasker> hah one attack turns the game in my bot favour
