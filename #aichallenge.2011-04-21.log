2011-04-21T00:12:48  <bhasker_> antimatroid how do i turn on symmetric food spawning
2011-04-21T00:12:58  <antimatroid> --food symmetric
2011-04-21T00:13:00  <antimatroid> i think
2011-04-21T00:13:17  <bhasker_> kk thanks
2011-04-21T00:17:20  <bhasker_> hmm all this new fangled code makes my bot play worse lol
2011-04-21T00:17:31  <bhasker_> i added logic to evaluate a move
2011-04-21T00:17:34  <bhasker_> and it now does worse
2011-04-21T00:17:41  <bhasker_> though the evaluation is flawed at he moment
2011-04-21T00:19:53  <amstan> antimatroid: you have to fix that, your symmetric food only works for your translation symmetry maps
2011-04-21T00:20:13  <antimatroid> amstan: what do you mean by fix?
2011-04-21T00:20:23  <amstan> it doesn't work for the other type of maps
2011-04-21T00:20:35  <antimatroid> what needs to happen is add a parameter for the map files indicating to the engine waht type of map it is
2011-04-21T00:20:43  <antimatroid> then the engine can use the correct food spawning method
2011-04-21T00:21:10  <Frontier> JSON map files anyone?
2011-04-21T00:21:15  <antimatroid> neg
2011-04-21T00:21:23  <bhasker_> i wish there was a 2 player map
2011-04-21T00:21:26  <bhasker_> to debug the bots
2011-04-21T00:21:33  <antimatroid> bhasker_: the map generator is there
2011-04-21T00:21:39  <bhasker_> 4-5 player is too erratic to make any sense
2011-04-21T00:21:40  <bhasker_> hmm k
2011-04-21T00:21:43  <bhasker_> let me try that out
2011-04-21T00:21:52  <Frontier> remove the c and the d from the map :p
2011-04-21T00:22:08  <antimatroid> Frontier: a and c or b and d would be better
2011-04-21T00:22:15  <antimatroid> actually, may not matter
2011-04-21T00:24:42  <amstan> there should be a 1 player map too
2011-04-21T00:24:47  <antimatroid> no
2011-04-21T00:24:52  <antimatroid> decision problems are not games
2011-04-21T00:25:06  <amstan> could be just one per player
2011-04-21T00:25:11  <amstan> to test the bot
2011-04-21T00:25:36  <antimatroid> the engine couldn't handle that anyway atm
2011-04-21T00:25:47  <antimatroid> it would just say they win or crash
2011-04-21T00:26:08  <antimatroid> or say the map is invalid or something
2011-04-21T00:28:12  <amstan> oh, ic

2011-04-21T01:57:20  <jaycobcoleman>  I actually think It would be very simple to implement if you would prefer it. So that's really what I'm wondering.

2011-04-21T02:02:24  <Frontier> Walls blocking everything including sight add a nice tactical element, don't you think? :-) But we had that discussion already.
2011-04-21T02:02:37  <jaycobcoleman> But I definitely see your point
2011-04-21T02:04:33  <jaycobcoleman> Frontier: Has an official decision actually been made on what the next game is going to be?
2011-04-21T02:04:55  <Frontier> sure, I think it will be ants :p
2011-04-21T02:05:52  <jaycobcoleman> next next game :0
2011-04-21T02:06:25  <McLeopold> I hope not
2011-04-21T02:06:28  <Frontier> No, but I believe it will be like the discussion for this game with a lot of proposals on the forums
2011-04-21T02:07:59  <jaycobcoleman> Alright, I'll be sure to watch closely. I'd like to be more of a part of the next one. I actuallly didn't know anything about these contests until a couple weeks ago
2011-04-21T02:08:21  <Frontier> like this term we had improved tron, several strategy games with space ships, soldiers etc., go, several ant game ideas....
2011-04-21T02:10:07  <jaycobcoleman> So did a fair amount of people actually continue work on things like planet wars and tron after they were done? Cause if so, I think that might be the right time to really go for realism with ants :)
2011-04-21T02:10:08  <Frontier> Jeff wants the games to be understandable by watching a replay. So there is usually no bunch of stats like hit points, expierience points, levels, fuels, harvest or similar.
2011-04-21T02:10:32  <jaycobcoleman> Oh I definitely agree. That'd be far too confusing
2011-04-21T02:11:32  <Frontier> It is all in the line of 5-minute-starter-packages and supporting all programming languages. There are more complicated contests directed at different audiences.
2011-04-21T02:14:58  <Frontier> I never tried the MIT challenge, but I guess they use terrain with different heights and different units with hit points, maybe aircraft?
2011-04-21T02:15:24  <jaycobcoleman> Oh my. Perhaps in the future :)
2011-04-21T02:15:37  <jaycobcoleman> I've certainly appreciated the simplicity. I'm not an incredibly experienced programmer, but I've understood everything dealt with very well
2011-04-21T02:15:58  <Frontier> oh I forgot a good game idea: There was also an adoption of a flash game about ww2 air planes

2011-04-21T02:34:18  <Frontier> jaycobcoleman: We thought about making each ant an individual process with very reduced communication, but it wasn't feasible.
2011-04-21T02:36:17  <jaycobcoleman> Oh trust me, I discovered that one for myself
2011-04-21T02:37:36  <Frontier> It's a pitty, because the communication option is fresh and could add a new dimension while keeping the rules simple.
2011-04-21T02:39:21  <jaycobcoleman> It'd be interesting to have the only inter-ant communication be via pheremone trails
2011-04-21T02:40:27  <Frontier> Of course that would add to the atmosphere of the game.
2011-04-21T02:41:05  <jaycobcoleman> We'll have to play around with some of these ideas. Post comp

2011-04-21T03:13:18  <Frontier> "Minor workers grab the enemy by the legs, pinning them down so majors can attack the body. In some species, soldier ants do the fighting, while the minor workers scurry to and from the battleground, dragging corpses of both enemy and kin back to the nest to feed the family."

2011-04-21T03:19:10  <jaycobcoleman> You couldn't have that sort of a simuation without it being on a large time scale
2011-04-21T03:19:58  <jaycobcoleman> because roles for each ant have to be established and the only realistic way of doing that is by the situation they're born into
2011-04-21T03:23:27  <Frontier> Doesn't the queen decide what its eggs will become and so define the roles?
2011-04-21T03:23:52  <jaycobcoleman> I think you're right
2011-04-21T03:24:28  <Frontier> A worker ant harvests and fights, a queen produces eggs, a fertilizing male .. well does have sex ^^ etc.
2011-04-21T03:25:18  <Frontier> oh and there are the female non-queen ants that use antibiotica to kill funghi and bacteria in the nest

2011-04-21T04:36:07  <Frontier> But it is good to know that you will start work on one now.
2011-04-21T04:37:01  <jaycobcoleman> Who will?
2011-04-21T04:37:47  <Frontier> the one who is asking
2011-04-21T04:42:09  <Frontier> The tcp server from planet wars was really good. But now with up to 10 players and the new scoring system there is not much that can be reused I guess. The communication to the clients can be reused. But for someone who knows nothing about the engine, database and scoring system it means a lot of learning and talking with the McLeopold, sigh and others.
2011-04-21T04:43:30  <Frontier> I guess it wont be there when we want to start the contest and one of the insiders will rush a tcp server and client wrapper if nothing else happens.

2011-04-21T04:58:44  <Frontier> jaycobcoleman: The roles of ants is really more complicated then beeing born as a worker, queen etc. There was an experiment where unsuccessful group of food foraging ants let others do the job and specialised in brood care instead (after a month).
2011-04-21T05:02:11  <Frontier> Leafcutter ants have even evolved into farmers. They only feed on fungus they grow and feed in their colony. They are kinda vegetarian it seems.
2011-04-21T05:08:25  <Frontier> "Extreme specialists among the slave-raiding ants, such as the Amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive."

2011-04-21T08:33:37  <Stocha> Problem with tcp server, is that i have no experience with wrapping std flux, nor do i have experience with std.
2011-04-21T08:33:59  <Stocha> then i have no experience with the ant framework (i used a homemade mock up for my experiment)
2011-04-21T08:34:51  <Stocha> so really, it would take quite some time for me to build the tcp stuff. especially without assistance. What about we make a quick specification to start with ? Then maybe i'll be willing to build some part of it.
2011-04-21T08:35:21  <Stocha> What are the feature a Tcp server needs ?

2011-04-21T09:46:37  <woudshoo`> Stocha: Oh, interstingly, attacking the closest ants sometimes works very well and in other runs fails miserably.  In general I get the impression that a lot depends on luck.
2011-04-21T09:46:54  <woudshoo`> food droppings and covering enough terrain in the beginning can be crucial.

2011-04-21T10:51:51  <delt0r_> yes
2011-04-21T10:52:17  <_0x47> hm, ok, so it's not very intelligent to attack hordes of ants with a single one... thanks
2011-04-21T10:52:27  <delt0r_> the damage is spread over all 3 ants.. since it can't kill any in a single turn...
2011-04-21T10:52:44  <delt0r_> you don't die... "health" regenrates each turn..
2011-04-21T10:53:18  <_0x47> so, if 3 ants arrive in a row, every round one of them is killed, where the other 3 ants are alive? in other words, the damage of the previous round is forgotten?
2011-04-21T10:53:23  <delt0r_> so having more is always better --an extream version of the number of guns idea
2011-04-21T10:53:32  <_0x47> hehe, you just answered my question
2011-04-21T10:53:35  <_0x47> thanks again

2011-04-21T10:54:46  <_0x47> one last question. do you guys have a place to test your bots besides local? because fighting against my own one is not so much fun (you win/loose either way)
2011-04-21T10:56:11  <delt0r_> I have not been following so far...
2011-04-21T10:56:20  <delt0r_> but typically a tcp version is set up
2011-04-21T10:56:54  <delt0r_> I would not be surprised if one is already running
2011-04-21T10:57:03  <delt0r_> previously these where unoffical
2011-04-21T10:57:27  <delt0r_> this time round-- again as i understand-- there was talk of a offical tcp server

2011-04-21T19:43:23  <antimatroid> disbelief == "lack of belief" or "belief in a lack of"?
2011-04-21T19:44:57  <jaycobcoleman> I think the latter
2011-04-21T19:45:32  <jaycobcoleman> non-believing vs. dis-believing

2011-04-21T19:46:18  <jaycobcoleman> Then again I don't really know that they're different. What is the context of the question?
2011-04-21T19:46:39  <antimatroid> i got in a really stupid argument last night over the definition of atheism
2011-04-21T19:47:53  <jaycobcoleman> Nonbelief
2011-04-21T19:48:52  <jaycobcoleman> actually there's a term for it
2011-04-21T19:48:57  <jaycobcoleman> it's unbelief
2011-04-21T19:49:54  <jaycobcoleman> I imagine you're an atheist?
2011-04-21T19:50:33  <antimatroid> i call myself a weak agnostic, and take that to mean I don't know whether something created what we call the universe or not, and don't know if a human could ever have definitive proof on such a question
2011-04-21T19:51:15  <antimatroid> i do however strongly doubt any of the "worshiped gods" exist
2011-04-21T19:52:59  <jaycobcoleman> realistically all anyone will every be able to do is theorize, but I'm prefectly satisfied treating theory as fact if I see no compelling reason to believe otherwise
2011-04-21T19:53:24  <antimatroid> how do you know such a creator couldn't decide to provide definitive proof that could be accepted?
2011-04-21T19:55:56  <jaycobcoleman> of course they could, but they haven't and I see no evidence that one will
2011-04-21T19:56:24  <jaycobcoleman> *haven't is clearly my own opinion of course
2011-04-21T19:59:23  <antimatroid> yes, hence i am agnostic
2011-04-21T19:59:50  <antimatroid> but i don't claim that it's impossible for something inside our universe to be given proof as to how it came to be
2011-04-21T20:00:11  <antimatroid> or to someone gain the answer to such a question
2011-04-21T20:00:16  <antimatroid> somehow*
2011-04-21T20:00:30  <antimatroid> some people make that claim

2011-04-21T20:04:00  <jaycobcoleman> I don't believe that it's impossible to prove the origin of the universe or for one to understand its origins, but I don't think it can ever be proven in a way that can't be twisted and continually challenged by theories that are, from an educated perspective, absurd
2011-04-21T20:05:13  <jaycobcoleman> have you used numpy arrays much?

2011-04-21T20:09:46  <jaycobcoleman> okay well I think you can answer my question anyway. It's more just a confirmation
2011-04-21T20:12:02  <jaycobcoleman> when comparing two sets of data using bitwise operators | or &, will the highest of the two values and the lowest of the two values always be return (respectively)
2011-04-21T20:12:16  <jaycobcoleman> *returned
2011-04-21T20:14:59  <jaycobcoleman> wait, nevermind. I understand
2011-04-21T20:18:30  <jaycobcoleman> I was just experementing with & and | for non-boolean values and upon seeing that 3 | 5 returns 7 I thought whaaaaat for a couple seconds and now I feel like an idiot
2011-04-21T20:20:00  <jaycobcoleman> It shouldn't be hard to understand what something does when it's in the name :P

2011-04-21T20:24:55  <antimatroid> reddit is in read only mode
2011-04-21T20:24:58  <antimatroid> it's horrible
2011-04-21T20:25:07  <sigh> is that supposed to be unusual?
2011-04-21T20:25:31  <antimatroid> can't tell if you're making a joke at their servers or not? :P
2011-04-21T20:26:06  <sigh> :P

2011-04-21T20:29:30  <jmcarthur> reddit's problems today are actually amazon's fault

2011-04-21T20:30:04  <sigh> :P
2011-04-21T20:31:00  <sigh> they've said (at least the guys who left reddit) have said that like 90% of reddit's downtime is because of amazon
2011-04-21T20:31:04  <jaycobcoleman> It's always Amazon's fault
2011-04-21T20:31:32  <jmcarthur> how do they explain the downtime from before they went to amazon?

2011-04-21T20:33:24  <antimatroid> although a lot of those people seem quite "stale" towards the reddit guys too
2011-04-21T20:34:02  <sigh> ketralnis say 80%
