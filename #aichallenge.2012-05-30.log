2012-05-30T07:45:49  <antimatroid1> thestinger: what have you been filling your time with lately?
2012-05-30T07:46:11  <thestinger> well, 4 udacity courses to finish up atm
2012-05-30T07:46:18  <antimatroid1> yeouch yeah
2012-05-30T07:46:21  <thestinger> and crypto-class from coursera still has the silly exam
2012-05-30T07:46:25  <antimatroid1> last 2 days of classes this semester here
2012-05-30T07:46:45  <thestinger> and I made a terminal based on vte because I got tired of the suckiness of all the others
2012-05-30T07:46:47  <antimatroid1> an exam seems sort of useless for an online course
2012-05-30T07:46:50  <thestinger> that didn't really use up much time though
2012-05-30T07:47:04  <antimatroid1> the whole point of an exam (imo) is to ensure you're examining the work of the students
2012-05-30T07:47:23  <antimatroid1> otherwise assignments etc. are much more useful ways to learn etc.
2012-05-30T07:47:29  <thestinger> antimatroid1: well, it lets you verify to yourself that you learned the stuff
2012-05-30T07:47:32  <thestinger> the exam is just another problem set
2012-05-30T07:47:35  <thestinger> but with 1 try
2012-05-30T07:47:48  <thestinger> I already have perfect on all the problem sets/homeworks anyway
2012-05-30T07:47:51  * antimatroid1 also sucks at exams :P
2012-05-30T07:48:15  <thestinger> yes, my brain likes to shut down
2012-05-30T07:48:19  <thestinger> it's not a real exam though
2012-05-30T07:48:27  <thestinger> because it's 3 hours time limit in your web browser
2012-05-30T07:48:39  <antimatroid1> take home exams are great
2012-05-30T07:48:47  <antimatroid1> i have 2 sit in exams this semester :|
2012-05-30T07:48:51  <antimatroid1> no take homes :(
2012-05-30T07:48:53  <thestinger> the udacity exams are awesome
2012-05-30T07:49:00  <thestinger> because they are mostly programming problems to solve
2012-05-30T07:49:05  <thestinger> peter norvig's course was great
2012-05-30T07:49:16  <thestinger> 6 programming problems were on the final exam, I finished them this morning :P
2012-05-30T07:49:18  <antimatroid1> yeah, hopefully i can do some of those courses in the future
2012-05-30T07:49:28  <antimatroid1> i really need to knuckle down with some research once this semester is fully over though
2012-05-30T07:49:34  <antimatroid1> nice
2012-05-30T07:49:44  <thestinger> one was to solve that Rush Hour game
2012-05-30T07:49:54  <thestinger> http://www.puzzles.com/products/rushhour/rhfrommarkriedel/jam.html
2012-05-30T07:50:00  <thestinger> that was kinda fun
2012-05-30T07:50:06  <antimatroid1> ha
2012-05-30T07:50:12  <antimatroid1> i played a game like that way back in the day
2012-05-30T07:50:21  <antimatroid1> without the cars
2012-05-30T07:50:28  <antimatroid1> just moving blocks around to get a specific one out
2012-05-30T07:50:46  <thestinger> one was darts probability and I didn't really enjoy doing that, it wasn't really a puzzle
2012-05-30T07:50:57  <thestinger> mostly just turning the silly requirements into a program to estimate the probability
2012-05-30T07:51:06  <antimatroid1> yeah that's no fun
2012-05-30T07:51:23  <antimatroid1> fighting with a problem until it clicks is what i'm in it for
2012-05-30T07:52:05  <thestinger> rest of the problems were pretty easy, one was just multiplication, addition, derivatives, integrals, powers of single variable polynomials
2012-05-30T07:52:12  <thestinger> and that just took a bunch of one liners
2012-05-30T07:52:40  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle one of these
2012-05-30T07:53:10  <thestinger> a silly one on scoring bowling, and then one for making high scoring (based on the criteria) portmanteaus from a wordlist
2012-05-30T07:53:54  <antimatroid1> i haven't written a line of code in months :(
2012-05-30T07:54:02  <thestinger> :0
2012-05-30T07:54:28  <antimatroid1> cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
2012-05-30T07:54:29  <antimatroid1> there we go
2012-05-30T07:54:43  <thestinger> silly endl
2012-05-30T07:55:08  <antimatroid1> i dislike how painful it is to overload for non-streams
2012-05-30T07:55:17  <antimatroid1> or my made up streams
2012-05-30T07:55:33  <thestinger> output is easy
2012-05-30T07:55:49  <thestinger> for input I have to look up the failbit stuff every time
2012-05-30T07:56:01  <antimatroid1> i don't check that stuff :P
2012-05-30T07:56:07  <antimatroid1> i just assume everything works perfectly
2012-05-30T07:56:17  <antimatroid1> i don't program for other people which helps
2012-05-30T07:56:29  <thestinger> my terminal thing actually has some users :P
2012-05-30T07:56:55  <thestinger> that's just a thin layer over vte though
2012-05-30T07:57:01  <thestinger> so I can blame vte if there's ever a bug
