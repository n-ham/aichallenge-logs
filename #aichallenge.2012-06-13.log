2012-06-13T08:28:49  <mcstar> antimatroid: do bogans have a sense of humor?
2012-06-13T08:28:58  <antimatroid> depends on the bogan
2012-06-13T08:29:00  <antimatroid> why?
2012-06-13T08:29:10  <antimatroid> avoid eye contact with bogans
2012-06-13T08:29:15  <mcstar> these two do like bogans...
2012-06-13T08:29:19  <antimatroid> they may consider it an invitation to fight ya
2012-06-13T08:29:58  <antimatroid> turns out my last exam is friday not saturday
2012-06-13T08:30:07  <antimatroid> and i haven't been to class since second week, i have a lot of learning to do :(
2012-06-13T08:30:12  <antimatroid> it's 10:30pm wednesday
2012-06-13T08:30:44  <mcstar> why would they schedule an exam for the weekend?
2012-06-13T08:31:12  <mcstar> or wait, saturday is considered a weekday down there?
2012-06-13T08:32:18  <antimatroid> my uni does exams on saturdays
2012-06-13T08:32:22  <antimatroid> and public holidays
2012-06-13T08:32:31  <antimatroid> classes aren't on saturdays though
2012-06-13T08:33:10  <antimatroid> i spent 4 hours in the measure theory exam
2012-06-13T08:33:28  <mcstar> oral exam?
2012-06-13T08:35:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: ^
2012-06-13T08:36:08  <antimatroid> nah written
2012-06-13T08:36:14  <antimatroid> an oral maths exam would be rather hard
2012-06-13T08:36:29  <mcstar> it is the usual here
2012-06-13T08:36:38  <mcstar> most exams are oral
2012-06-13T08:36:50  <mcstar> + sometimes written
2012-06-13T08:37:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: can you tell me briefly why measure theory is important, and what is its application/usefulness?
2012-06-13T08:38:40  <antimatroid> well without measure theory you don't have integration theory as we know it
2012-06-13T08:38:42  <antimatroid> so there's that
2012-06-13T08:38:52  <antimatroid> measure theory is used a lot in maths, physics, economics, etc.
2012-06-13T08:38:59  <antimatroid> pretty much anywhere probability is used
2012-06-13T08:39:22  <antimatroid> unless you're working in theory you probably have no use for it though
2012-06-13T08:39:41  <mcstar> afaik, it is used to prove properties only
2012-06-13T08:39:46  <mcstar> at least the way i see it
2012-06-13T08:40:03  <antimatroid> it's a formal way of understanding how to measure things
2012-06-13T08:40:09  <antimatroid> i see that as important
2012-06-13T08:40:23  <mcstar> i dont think i ever got that
2012-06-13T08:40:24  <antimatroid> and yes useful for proving stuff with anything that needs to be "measured"
2012-06-13T08:40:53  <antimatroid> it's rather messy, you need to start out with sigma algebras because you can't just define a measure on any subset of the power set
2012-06-13T08:40:58  <antimatroid> it doesn't work nicely
2012-06-13T08:41:03  <antimatroid> i'm not sure why off the top of my head ah
2012-06-13T08:41:23  <antimatroid> then there's outer measures
2012-06-13T08:41:35  <mcstar> i watched andrew wiles talk about his proof, he mentioned 'counting', establishing a 1to1 correspondece between elliptic curves and modular forms, i had a feeling, maybe measure theory is the generalization of that kind counting
2012-06-13T08:42:04  <antimatroid> don't know about that
2012-06-13T08:42:17  <antimatroid> a lot of mathematics is studying maps between different objects
2012-06-13T08:42:26  <antimatroid> isomorphisms etc.
2012-06-13T08:42:54  <antimatroid> basically homomorphisms are maps that preserve the structure of the objects, then you can use those to map what you know about one object to another object etc.
2012-06-13T08:43:32  <antimatroid> all of my game theory stuff is just studying the isomorphisms/automorphisms of games
2012-06-13T08:44:04  <mcstar> structure of the objects, or structure of the space those objects live in?
2012-06-13T08:58:40  <antimatroid> usually the structure of the objects
2012-06-13T08:59:47  <antimatroid> like if you have two objects (X, .) and (Y, *) where . and * are binary operations on X and Y you would define a function f:X->Y as a homomorphism if f(x.y) = f(x)*f(y) for all x,y \in X
2012-06-13T09:00:31  <antimatroid> which is to say, it doesn't matter if you apply the operation and then map the product, or map the elements then take the product
2012-06-13T09:01:12  <antimatroid> it's usually easier to just omit the operations and write f(xy) = f(x)f(y)
2012-06-13T09:01:28  <antimatroid> although abc only makes sense if you have associativity
2012-06-13T09:01:36  <antimatroid> otherwise it's unambiguous
2012-06-13T09:01:44  <antimatroid> sorry, ambiguous*
2012-06-13T09:02:23  <mcstar> so you call the set X and the binary operation an object, ok
2012-06-13T09:02:34  <antimatroid> usually you'd have a name
2012-06-13T09:02:40  <antimatroid> like if the operation is associative it's a semigroup
2012-06-13T09:02:49  <mcstar> i first thought you call the elements of the set objects
2012-06-13T09:03:01  <antimatroid> then if you take the class of semigroups and their morphisms that's a category
2012-06-13T09:03:23  <antimatroid> nah, i'm sort of loosely using category theory phrasing
2012-06-13T09:03:29  <mcstar> k
2012-06-13T09:03:50  <antimatroid> like in the category of semigroups, the class of objects is the class of semigroups
2012-06-13T09:03:55  <antimatroid> so an object is a semigroup if you will
2012-06-13T09:04:12  <antimatroid> can you tell i don't want to study? :P
2012-06-13T09:04:52  <mcstar> no
2012-06-13T09:05:17  <mcstar> or is this relaxing to you?
2012-06-13T09:05:20  <antimatroid> yes
2012-06-13T09:05:33  <mcstar> lazy bastard, get back to study!
2012-06-13T09:05:35  <antimatroid> it's easy to talk about stuff you know
2012-06-13T09:05:59  <mcstar> (or stay and entertain me...)
2012-06-13T09:06:00  <antimatroid> i quickly don't know what i'm talking about with some of this though
2012-06-13T09:06:13  <antimatroid> it's getting cold here :(
2012-06-13T09:06:26  <antimatroid> although it's currently only 9 outside
2012-06-13T09:07:18  <mcstar> antimatroid: have you red the book: Proofs from The Book?
2012-06-13T09:07:21  <mcstar> read*
2012-06-13T09:07:41  <antimatroid> no, but i know of it
2012-06-13T09:07:47  <mcstar> i started to
2012-06-13T09:07:51  <mcstar> first chapter done
2012-06-13T09:08:04  <mcstar> i can prove the infinitude of primes in a shit load of different ways...
2012-06-13T09:08:17  <mcstar> XD
2012-06-13T09:08:28  <antimatroid> :p
2012-06-13T09:08:36  <antimatroid> i've seen at least a couple in classes
2012-06-13T09:08:37  <mcstar> i should give it a try in the field
2012-06-13T09:08:41  <mcstar> i mean a pub...
2012-06-13T09:09:08  <antimatroid> people can't use the words group, ring, field etc. without me having to stop and consider what they mean
2012-06-13T09:09:20  <antimatroid> also i keep wanting to write semester as symmester
2012-06-13T09:09:30  <antimatroid> cause i write symm... all the time
2012-06-13T09:09:31  <mcstar> o.O
2012-06-13T09:09:42  <GuiKa> wow be carrefull you'r writing too much the chan may explode

2012-06-13T09:13:12  <antimatroid> heh :P
2012-06-13T09:15:06  <mcstar> antimatroid: basically he had to figure things out from some obscure (and very large) german database how some other table was made from that, and had to reproduce it, it was an 8 hour job
2012-06-13T09:15:32  <antimatroid> NOPE
2012-06-13T09:15:43  <mcstar> yeah

2012-06-13T09:15:57  <antimatroid> a job is better than no job
2012-06-13T09:16:03  <antimatroid> just continue searching
2012-06-13T09:16:09  <mcstar> true, and he is at it for a year now
2012-06-13T09:16:33  <antimatroid> i would be willing to do that if i couldn't find anything else
2012-06-13T09:16:44  <mcstar> i think he just unable to sell himself
2012-06-13T09:16:52  <antimatroid> i'm not real good at that either

2012-06-13T17:17:44  <mcstar> thats how historians will refer to it
2012-06-13T17:22:26  <thestinger> lol
2012-06-13T17:30:02  <mcstar> thestinger: i updated a friend of mine's installatin
2012-06-13T17:30:11  <mcstar> he did do it for quite some time
2012-06-13T17:30:22  <mcstar> and after the update, he couldnt log in
2012-06-13T17:30:23  <mcstar> at all
2012-06-13T17:30:46  <mcstar> he didnt do it*
2012-06-13T17:32:19  <mcstar> well, it was possible to log in in single user mode

2012-06-13T17:39:33  <thestinger> yeah
2012-06-13T17:39:37  <mcstar> say so
2012-06-13T17:39:42  <mcstar> i dont want to speak to the wall
2012-06-13T17:39:54  <thestinger> but I'm a wall who listens well :P
2012-06-13T17:40:02  <mcstar> good enough
2012-06-13T17:40:14  <mcstar> can you guess the problem?
2012-06-13T17:40:50  <mcstar> after he typed in his login name, an error occured: incorrect login
2012-06-13T17:41:06  <mcstar> i.e. before the typed in his password
2012-06-13T17:41:08  <thestinger> something to do with hashes?
2012-06-13T17:41:20  <mcstar> ofc, he didnt tell me that soon enough...
2012-06-13T17:41:26  <mcstar> no, not hashes
2012-06-13T17:41:59  <mcstar> i made him check all the important files, /etc/passwd,shadow, /etc/pam.d/*
2012-06-13T17:42:09  <mcstar> all checked out
2012-06-13T17:42:17  <mcstar> ah, yeah, another deatil
2012-06-13T17:42:33  <mcstar> when logged in single user mode, he couldnt use passwd to change the root password
2012-06-13T17:42:48  <thestinger> read-only / ?
2012-06-13T17:42:52  <mcstar> no
2012-06-13T17:42:58  <mcstar> module not loaded error
2012-06-13T17:43:03  <thestinger> aha
2012-06-13T17:43:08  <thestinger> hm
2012-06-13T17:43:09  <mcstar> not kernel module
2012-06-13T17:43:12  <thestinger> oh
2012-06-13T17:43:13  <thestinger> pam module?
2012-06-13T17:43:16  <mcstar> yeah
2012-06-13T17:43:37  <mcstar> anyway, fortunately i check /var/log/auth.log
2012-06-13T17:43:48  <mcstar> checked*
2012-06-13T17:44:24  <mcstar> turned out, it couldnt load the .so libs these pam modules resided in
2012-06-13T17:44:55  <mcstar> first clue: it was looking for them under /lib/security but i only had /usr/lib/security
2012-06-13T17:45:06  <thestinger> oh right, all that stuff got moved
2012-06-13T17:45:11  <mcstar> so i said, k, lets simlink it
2012-06-13T17:45:15  <mcstar> yeah i know that now
2012-06-13T17:45:33  <thestinger> more is getting moved
2012-06-13T17:45:34  <mcstar> after that, it found the lib, but didnt find the right version
2012-06-13T17:45:45  <thestinger>  /bin, /sbin and /lib will be gone
2012-06-13T17:45:45  <mcstar> all the pam stuff was 1.5.1
2012-06-13T17:45:53  <thestinger> they will be symlinks to /usr/bin, etc.
2012-06-13T17:45:54  <mcstar> but it was looking for a 1.3.1 version
2012-06-13T17:45:58  <mcstar> thestinger: yeah i know
2012-06-13T17:46:23  <mcstar> at that point i realized, that wrong libs were loaded
2012-06-13T17:46:37  <mcstar> pacman didnt remove the libpam* libs form /lib
2012-06-13T17:46:52  <mcstar> and they were loaded before the /usr/lib/libpam* ones
2012-06-13T17:46:56  <thestinger> weird
2012-06-13T17:47:09  <mcstar> so they were looking for different versions of the pam_* moduels
2012-06-13T17:47:28  <mcstar> deleting the lefover libs solved the problem
2012-06-13T17:47:50  <mcstar> something else, circa 2-3 days ago i decided i needed emacs 24
2012-06-13T17:47:56  <mcstar> i built it from aur
2012-06-13T17:48:05  <mcstar> but today it was already in extra
2012-06-13T17:48:25  <mcstar> anyway, good to have emacs 24 in extra
2012-06-13T17:48:31  <mcstar> i had several problems with 23
2012-06-13T17:50:15  <mcstar> thestinger: btw, how was the crypto exam?
2012-06-13T17:50:46  <thestinger> 1 wrong the first time, but for whatever reason they had a second try and I took it
2012-06-13T17:51:05  <thestinger> the algo class didn't have retries for the exam
2012-06-13T17:51:08  <thestinger> and it was timed
2012-06-13T17:51:28  <mcstar> it seems not that many people will make it though
2012-06-13T17:51:45  <thestinger> really? it was easier than the problem sets
2012-06-13T17:51:52  <mcstar> i told you :)
2012-06-13T17:51:56  <thestinger> some of the problem set questions were quite tricky
2012-06-13T17:51:56  <mcstar> not for that
2012-06-13T17:52:17  <mcstar> there was a post, that listed how many people gave solutions to each problem set
2012-06-13T17:52:44  * thestinger got 100% on everything thanks to the retries :P
2012-06-13T17:52:45  <mcstar> building on that id say 3k people will get a certificate
2012-06-13T17:52:55  <mcstar> i didnt bother with retries
2012-06-13T17:52:57  <thestinger> imo they shouldn't give so many
2012-06-13T17:53:09  <thestinger> they do have different answers on the retries
2012-06-13T17:53:28  <mcstar> ok, i should have said usually didnt bother with them
2012-06-13T17:53:33  <thestinger> but at the start they were just reordering the answers (maybe for the first two problem sets)
