2011-01-21T11:58:51  <McLeopold> never heard of d
2011-01-21T12:00:46  <Frontier> McLeopold: What is your favorite language again?
2011-01-21T12:01:52  <McLeopold> Python, but I'm learning lisp now.
2011-01-21T12:02:12  <McLeopold> I tried learning haskell but it hurt my brain.
2011-01-21T12:02:40  <McLeopold> D looks like it's got everything but the kitchen sink.
2011-01-21T12:03:24  <Frontier> D is somewhat C++, Delphi, Java-ish. I keep an eye on it, but there is too little support and a few open issues, like 64-bit support and shared libraries under linux. I really miss full IDE support with all the productivity tools you have in Java or at least C++ by now.
2011-01-21T12:03:57  <Frontier> Try brainfuck - that hurts your brain
2011-01-21T12:04:50  <McLeopold> Yeah, I think whitespace is worse. :)
2011-01-21T12:05:30  <Frontier> Lisp's syntax is so far away from what I'm used to that I might never touch it again. (Except for the one time in an ai course)
2011-01-21T12:06:16  <McLeopold> I'm actually groking it pretty fast.  I tried a few years ago, but didn't get it.
2011-01-21T12:06:27  <McLeopold> I'm reading "Land of Lisip"
2011-01-21T12:06:32  <McLeopold> *Lisp*
2011-01-21T12:08:01  <Frontier> what did you mean by "everything but the kitchen sink"? I thought you don't know the language.

2011-01-21T12:09:38  <McLeopold> nope
2011-01-21T12:10:26  <boegel> McLeopold: hmmk, thx
2011-01-21T12:10:39  <boegel> McLeopold: what about the type of game for the contest?
2011-01-21T12:10:47  <jmcarthur> i was a D guy in the pre-2.0 days
2011-01-21T12:11:16  <jmcarthur> it's *much* nicer than C++, which i'd say is its closest relative
2011-01-21T12:11:52  <jmcarthur> but that comparison also says a lot about it
2011-01-21T12:12:04  <jmcarthur> it's basically C++ done right
2011-01-21T12:12:49  <Frontier> lol, that is what i was looking for. a replacement for c++.
2011-01-21T12:14:40  <Frontier> you can use a garbage collector, and use 'auto' as variable type. Where you write something like "MySpecialClass mc = new MySpecialClass(...);" it becomes "auto mc = ...". It isn't necessary to repeat the class name.
2011-01-21T12:14:51  <jmcarthur> well, then i would highly recommend D, if that's your goal
2011-01-21T12:15:42  <jmcarthur> it's true that it lacks a lot of tool and community support. that's its biggest problem
2011-01-21T12:15:50  <Frontier> but first i have to read McLeopolds LISP comic with the ant that says "omnomnom" while eating honey
2011-01-21T12:16:08  <jmcarthur> lack of adoption leads to even less adoption :(
2011-01-21T12:17:21  <Frontier> Code::Blocks has a pretty good C++ parser and code completion plugin. But they have no D developer in their team to extend the plugin. I think that would be a real popularity booster, as quite a few C developers use Code::Blocks
2011-01-21T12:18:04  <Frontier> The plugin supports D, but you only get very basic code completion.
2011-01-21T12:19:32  <McLeopold> boegel: We need to get Jeff to commit to an announcement date.
2011-01-21T12:20:41  <boegel> McLeopold: hmmk, cool
2011-01-21T12:25:10  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@vpnc173.ugent.be> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2011-01-21T12:28:53  <Frontier> McLeopold: The LISP functional guild cruiser kills bugs with functions that have no side effects. In D there is the 'pure' keyword for that purpose. ++ on some dates, even just a 'game idea submission deadline'.
2011-01-21T12:30:24  <McLeopold> I think we need another round of voting.
2011-01-21T12:32:02  <Frontier> Another round of voting? I wonder what Jeff wants to decide by himself and what is open for a vote.
2011-01-21T12:33:36  <Frontier> LISP macros ... I never really liked them in C. They always felt like 'the language is missing important features so we implemented a macro language in the language'. It may be a different thing in LISP.
2011-01-21T12:34:05  <jmcarthur> lisp macros are *way* nicer than C macros
2011-01-21T12:34:47  <jmcarthur> nice enough that it's actually pretty easy to make a new language within lisp just using macros
2011-01-21T12:34:55  <jmcarthur> and it doesn't look like a pile of crap

2011-01-21T12:36:36  <Frontier> hehe, I also like the 'restarts' that remind me much of a SQL transaction
2011-01-21T12:37:09  <jmcarthur> restarts?
2011-01-21T12:37:10  <McLeopold> In lisp, code is data, so it makes more sense.
2011-01-21T12:37:28  <jmcarthur> what lisp is this?
2011-01-21T12:37:43  <jmcarthur> common?
2011-01-21T12:38:21  <jmcarthur> restart makes me think of STM, which is pretty awesome
2011-01-21T12:38:25  <McLeopold> yes, the book covers clisp, but the comic at the end references a lot of different lisp implementations
2011-01-21T12:38:39  <jmcarthur> clojure has an STM implementation, iirc
2011-01-21T12:38:40  <McLeopold> it could be arc or sblc
2011-01-21T12:38:49  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-01-21T12:41:07  <jmcarthur> yeah, "code is data" is one of lisp's more interesting properties. not many non-lisp languages have that
2011-01-21T12:41:24  <jmcarthur> at least, not in such an easily accessible AST
2011-01-21T12:41:25  <McLeopold> javascript has json, that pretty close
2011-01-21T12:41:35  <jmcarthur> Io has it, and a few other dynamic languages do
2011-01-21T12:42:29  <jmcarthur> a lot of statically typed functional languages don't quite have "code is data," but they do have "functions are data" in that you can dynamically construct an arbitrary function, but you can't deconstruct one already created
2011-01-21T12:43:09  <jmcarthur> unless of course you make your own AST and interpreter
2011-01-21T12:43:28  <jmcarthur> overloading can hide the fact that you're working with an AST though, which gives you much of the same end result
2011-01-21T12:43:53  <jmcarthur> but it's a little more work up front

2011-01-21T14:01:32  <Frontier> jmcarthur: I watched the presentation and from what he explained I couldn't see anything that a template function wouldn't solve. But he also talked about scheme and typed-scheme. So I assume basic language elements can be replaced by macros that introduce type safety. That would be a powerful tool... I have yet to associate real world problems with that. I'm thinking too much inside the box here.
2011-01-21T14:03:46  <jmcarthur> Frontier: part of the appeal of lisp macros is simply that the syntax is easier to work with than most other languages. and yes, you can do a lot of very fancy stuff that require a little mind expansion to fully appreciate
