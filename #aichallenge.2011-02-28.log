2011-02-28T00:20:31  <jmcarthur> it's amazing what some basic profiling can reveal about performance
2011-02-28T00:21:01  <jmcarthur> in the last twenty minutes or so i've doubled the speed of my already pretty fast starter
2011-02-28T00:22:12  <jmcarthur> yay for low hanging fruit

2011-02-28T00:25:04  <antimatroid> hmmm, i think i've worked out how to make these symmetrical games
2011-02-28T00:38:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm thinking we don't need to produce maps with starting food.
2011-02-28T00:40:59  <antimatroid> you want the engine to do it?
2011-02-28T00:41:05  <McLeopold> Yes
2011-02-28T00:41:07  <antimatroid> it would be good if that was at least symmetric at the start i think
2011-02-28T00:41:17  <antimatroid> if the water is to also be symmetric
2011-02-28T00:41:36  <McLeopold> Yes, I'm thinking a certain radius around the starting ants should have symmetric food.

2011-02-28T00:41:43  <McLeopold> Even on non-symmetric maps.
2011-02-28T00:41:51  <antimatroid> and if we do asymmetric maps, it's going to be really hard to test "fairness" if the engine isn't doing exacly the same food spawning on it
2011-02-28T00:42:45  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I made some asymmetric maps, did you see those? they looked cool
2011-02-28T00:42:48  <McLeopold> I'm thinking fairness will be making sure everyone can get to the same amount of land first, plus the same average distance to each opponent.

2011-02-28T00:43:27  <antimatroid> that was very rough asymmetric maps

2011-02-28T00:44:25  <antimatroid> i might try the tree idea but add a line of length rand(1,4) each time i place walls onto to tree
2011-02-28T00:44:28  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I saw you had issues with the engine?  what were they?
2011-02-28T00:47:49  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i think it was basically that i had no idea how to run it, had to change things from how they are written in the makefile, run into some issues with paths or somesuch, had no idea which maps where good and which were bad, etc.
2011-02-28T00:48:17  <McLeopold> okay, so, general orgainization, but no bugs?
2011-02-28T00:48:48  <jmcarthur> at least one appeared to be either a bug or a problem with my python installation. h/o
2011-02-28T00:49:54  <jmcarthur> err... now i can't find what the issue was. not showing my changes with git diff. maybe i reverted it after all
2011-02-28T00:50:00  <jmcarthur> i honestly don't remember
2011-02-28T00:50:06  <jmcarthur> i'll let you know if i think of it later
2011-02-28T00:50:57  <McLeopold> okay, I'll need to come up with a howto for testing bots
2011-02-28T00:52:22  <McLeopold> so, on starter bots...
2011-02-28T00:52:37  <McLeopold> j3camero wanted simple starters for new programmers.
2011-02-28T00:53:00  <McLeopold> I'd rather have starter packs showcase good design in the language chosen.
2011-02-28T00:53:33  <McLeopold> Make class/library/include/whatever so that the example bots has nothing but ai-logic.
2011-02-28T00:53:57  <McLeopold> I attempted to even put the parsing stuff in my python and java support files.
2011-02-28T00:53:59  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ah you missed my conversation with j3camero earlier
2011-02-28T00:54:06  <McLeopold> I'm reading some of it
2011-02-28T00:54:21  <McLeopold> contestbot seen j3camero
2011-02-28T00:54:21  <contestbot> McLeopold: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 5 hours, 18 minutes, and 54 seconds ago: <j3camero> Good point.
2011-02-28T00:54:34  <McLeopold> ^^ he agreed with you, then left?
2011-02-28T00:54:42  * jmcarthur shrugs
2011-02-28T00:54:43  <jmcarthur> i guess
2011-02-28T00:55:16  <McLeopold> anyway, if he wants starter packs for new programmers, that's different than starter pack for programmers new to a language
2011-02-28T00:55:39  <McLeopold> If people are willing, we could have several per language.
2011-02-28T00:55:46  <jmcarthur> eek
2011-02-28T00:55:57  <McLeopold> Okay, just 2.
2011-02-28T00:56:06  <McLeopold> simple / elegant
2011-02-28T00:56:46  <McLeopold> It's just an idea.  I don't want to not showcase the enum in java, just because it takes some thought.

2011-02-28T00:57:20  <McLeopold> I'm assuming haskell has even more tricks to showcase.
2011-02-28T00:59:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so, should starter pack logic be, for each ant, go n or e or s or w?
2011-02-28T01:00:23  <McLeopold> It's really stupid and ants will get stuck in ne corners, and step on each other...
2011-02-28T01:01:07  <McLeopold> I'm almost thinking HunterBot should be the example.

2011-02-28T01:01:28  <McLeopold> for each ant, find closest target, head that direction
2011-02-28T01:01:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i imagine a lot of beginners may end up trying to do advanced hunter bots
2011-02-28T01:02:06  <antimatroid> i still think it's better to leave the start bots as stupid as go n, e, s or w
2011-02-28T01:02:20  <antimatroid> you could make movement random?
2011-02-28T01:02:44  <McLeopold> the planet wars one wasn't that stupid
2011-02-28T01:02:52  <antimatroid> it was pretty stupid
2011-02-28T01:03:01  <antimatroid> tron was exactly that
2011-02-28T01:03:05  <McLeopold> for each planet, find weak target, send 1/2 ships
2011-02-28T01:03:19  <McLeopold> that's almost hunter bot
2011-02-28T01:03:58  <McLeopold> Well, I think showing them the proper distance formula is good.
2011-02-28T01:04:34  <antimatroid> my distance function is just state.distance(loc1, loc2)
2011-02-28T01:04:43  <McLeopold> I also think a starter bot that doesn't have ants collide would be good too
2011-02-28T01:04:55  <antimatroid> my ants wont collide
2011-02-28T01:05:01  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-28T01:05:18  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: haskell has a lot of tricks, sure, but i actually don't have any intention of making a "showy" starter. i just want to have more of a black box library and an extremely simple starter

2011-02-28T01:06:01  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: does your starter prevent collisions?
2011-02-28T01:06:08  <antimatroid> i agreed with the arguments last time about code being released too, if everyone keeps their code to themselves, you know how well you have done relative to the other people who sat down and programmed
2011-02-28T01:06:10  <jmcarthur> not right now
2011-02-28T01:06:36  <jmcarthur> it only checks for water
2011-02-28T01:06:57  <antimatroid> that's the crux of my starter bot at present
2011-02-28T01:06:57  <antimatroid> State.cc - http://codepad.org/M5fUZMAX
2011-02-28T01:06:57  <antimatroid> MyBot.cc - http://codepad.org/vgkz1DsA
2011-02-28T01:08:02  <antimatroid> distance is wrong for that, i need to update that
2011-02-28T01:08:03  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I do sort of agree with you on sharing code, but it is not enforcable
2011-02-28T01:08:09  <jmcarthur> http://hpaste.org/44386/ants_starter_again
2011-02-28T01:08:17  <antimatroid> no not enforcable, just to be encouraged i think
2011-02-28T01:08:43  <McLeopold> We should come up with an official statement.
2011-02-28T01:08:55  <McLeopold> pseudo code only on forums, or something
2011-02-28T01:09:04  <McLeopold> no submittable bots
2011-02-28T01:09:08  <jmcarthur> i'd like to make those type signatures less weird. i might get rid of the magic 's' type parameter, at least
2011-02-28T01:09:13  <jmcarthur> eh
2011-02-28T01:09:17  <jmcarthur> i don't know about rules like that
2011-02-28T01:09:26  <McLeopold> frameworks okay?
2011-02-28T01:09:30  <antimatroid> encourage pseudo code and general strategy advice rather than actual code sharing, something like that anyway
2011-02-28T01:09:31  <jmcarthur> what's the definition of a starter pack, for example?
2011-02-28T01:09:36  <antimatroid> tools are okay
2011-02-28T01:09:52  <antimatroid> i think people should be fine to release "toolboxes"
2011-02-28T01:10:13  <antimatroid> a starter pack is there to enable people to easily get started programming a bot
2011-02-28T01:10:15  <jmcarthur> i think we could have an official statement on what we'd like to *discourage*, but to make a hard rule would be going too far, IMO
2011-02-28T01:10:55  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: there's no way to enforce it, there's too much grey area, but still, I think we should discourage releasing bot code until after the final submission
2011-02-28T01:11:01  <antimatroid> imo serious competitors should really be writing their own bot from scratch, after playing around with a starter bot
2011-02-28T01:11:07  <McLeopold> right, no hard rule
2011-02-28T01:11:14  <McLeopold> maybe just forum maintenance
2011-02-28T01:11:37  <antimatroid> generally people have been happy to comply with what people want
2011-02-28T01:11:49  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-28T01:11:57  <antimatroid> and most people don't want to share their code anyway
2011-02-28T01:12:13  <McLeopold> not until they give up or run out of time...
2011-02-28T01:12:32  <McLeopold> I think we had to major releases last contest
2011-02-28T01:12:35  <McLeopold> 2
2011-02-28T01:13:00  <antimatroid> i only saw the 1
2011-02-28T01:13:24  <antimatroid> and i don't think that would have happened with a friendly comment pointing out why it might be better not to
2011-02-28T01:13:45  <McLeopold> okay, so, we'll write something up and show jeff
2011-02-28T01:13:56  <jmcarthur> i remember one guy that took it down after all the protests but strongly disagreed that it was such a big deal
2011-02-28T01:14:18  <antimatroid> i sort of agreed that it really didn't matter to rankings, but agreed with peoples protests more
2011-02-28T01:15:30  <McLeopold> I think we should care about everyone's rankings, not just the top.  Some people will still want to try and compete at the level they are at.  Discouraging it keeps the contest fun for themm.
2011-02-28T01:15:41  <jmcarthur> agreed
2011-02-28T01:16:12  <McLeopold> so, starter bot logic... Hunter Bot?
2011-02-28T01:18:39  <jmcarthur> describe hunter bot at a high level, please
2011-02-28T01:18:56  <McLeopold> let me just copy paste from above...
2011-02-28T01:19:10  <jmcarthur> personally, i was thinking of having a really stupid starter with an accompanying tutorial to improve it a bit
2011-02-28T01:19:10  <McLeopold> for each ant, find closest target, head that direction
2011-02-28T01:19:29  <McLeopold> target being food and enemy ants
2011-02-28T01:19:36  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-28T01:19:49  <McLeopold> no path finding
2011-02-28T01:19:57  <McLeopold> no division of labor
2011-02-28T01:20:06  <jmcarthur> so if there's water in the way just don't move, or pick a different target?
2011-02-28T01:20:15  <McLeopold> just don't move
2011-02-28T01:20:23  <jmcarthur> what about avoiding collisions?
2011-02-28T01:20:32  <McLeopold> I'd say yes
2011-02-28T01:20:54  <McLeopold> I'd like to avoid newbie questions of, "why do my ants disappear?"
2011-02-28T01:21:05  <antimatroid> if i did hunter bot i would do it with a queue and paint outwards
2011-02-28T01:21:41  <McLeopold> okay, advanced math techniques should not be in, just simple, possible slow, algorithms
2011-02-28T01:21:57  <McLeopold> so, wrapped distance formula only
2011-02-28T01:22:25  <jmcarthur> personally i think hunterbot would make a good target for a tutorial
2011-02-28T01:22:29  <jmcarthur> instead of being the default starter
2011-02-28T01:22:35  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm with jmcarthur
2011-02-28T01:22:54  <McLeopold> okay, n-e-s-w colliding bot?
2011-02-28T01:22:54  <antimatroid> it's something even a beginner can start with and get hooked
2011-02-28T01:23:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: have you heard of jmcarthurs beta period?
2011-02-28T01:23:08  <jmcarthur> yeah, i'm quite happy with my n-e-s-w right now
2011-02-28T01:23:10  <antimatroid> not colliding
2011-02-28T01:23:18  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-28T01:23:28  <antimatroid> just update the char grid as you move ants and don't move them into a square containing an ant, simple
2011-02-28T01:24:06  <McLeopold> we know how not to do it, the question is should the logic be in the starter :P
2011-02-28T01:24:48  <McLeopold> or is that tutorial step 1?
2011-02-28T01:25:04  <antimatroid> basically, have a public 1-2 week beta period once everythings about ready to go live with an explicit statement saying it's still a testing phase and rules can/will change, get some hype going and the submissions rolling, then have the official launch once everything goes properly live
2011-02-28T01:25:32  <McLeopold> I don't have an opinion about a beta, let jeff decide
2011-02-28T01:25:39  <antimatroid> tutorial step one, can tell them to "update makeMove function to "move" the ant"
2011-02-28T01:25:51  <antimatroid> i was mentioning it, not asking you to make a decision :P
2011-02-28T01:25:57  <antimatroid> jeff is a bit mehy as well
2011-02-28T01:26:12  <McLeopold> He just wants a grand opening
2011-02-28T01:26:29  <McLeopold> so, let's make the starter collide
2011-02-28T01:26:33  <antimatroid> i think he's worried we'll blow the hype on the first "announcement"
2011-02-28T01:26:41  <McLeopold> he's right
2011-02-28T01:26:45  <antimatroid> i disagree
2011-02-28T01:26:49  <McLeopold> whatever
2011-02-28T01:26:50  <antimatroid> i think it'd help hype
2011-02-28T01:27:13  <jmcarthur> i'm not going to take a strong opinion on it. i think it would build hype, personally, but it won't bother me not to get my way on this one
2011-02-28T01:27:38  <antimatroid> yeah i'm not hugely caring, but i think it's a good idea for numerous reasons :\
2011-02-28T01:27:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid: colliding starter packs, yes?
2011-02-28T01:27:47  <antimatroid> McLeopold: sure
2011-02-28T01:27:50  <McLeopold> okay, done
2011-02-28T01:27:54  <jmcarthur> yeah, i think prevent collisions makes a good step one
2011-02-28T01:28:00  <jmcarthur> *preventing
2011-02-28T01:28:32  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you making sure food doesn't generate adjacent to an ant or more food?
2011-02-28T01:28:48  <McLeopold> I haven't had time to make a good food spawning algo yet.
2011-02-28T01:29:04  <antimatroid> what happens when an ant walks onto food atm?
2011-02-28T01:29:13  <McLeopold> It can't, food blocks
2011-02-28T01:29:26  <McLeopold> so, it's an invalid order
2011-02-28T01:29:32  <McLeopold> or, ignored
2011-02-28T01:29:34  <antimatroid> ok, so move ant if grid cell != '%' or '*'?
2011-02-28T01:29:53  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-28T01:30:22  <McLeopold> I'm thinking I won't worry about where food is spawned, I don't want to bias the food to unoccupied areas.
2011-02-28T01:30:46  <McLeopold> If the spot chosen is occupied, I'll just pick the closest unoccupied spot to it.
2011-02-28T01:32:10  <McLeopold> antimatroid: what was your preference on radius?
2011-02-28T01:32:14  <jmcarthur> i think that's a good idea
2011-02-28T01:32:35  <jmcarthur> if food only spawns unoccupied areas then there is less incentive to occupy territory
2011-02-28T01:32:51  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: maybe that is good?
2011-02-28T01:32:59  <jmcarthur> depends on battle resolution
2011-02-28T01:33:10  <antimatroid> lock in view2 = 96
2011-02-28T01:33:21  <antimatroid> i'm unsure about the other two
2011-02-28T01:33:24  <jmcarthur> i dunno
2011-02-28T01:33:49  <antimatroid> i think maybe spawn2 = 1, attack2 = 5?
2011-02-28T01:34:28  <McLeopold> I want spawn at least 2
2011-02-28T01:34:28  <jmcarthur> personally i think we should vary those parameters, at least for the first few weeks
2011-02-28T01:34:32  <jmcarthur> then we can nail them down
2011-02-28T01:35:04  <antimatroid> i think spawn should be small, make it 2?
2011-02-28T01:35:06  <antimatroid> then vary attack
2011-02-28T01:35:28  <McLeopold> Wasn't there some concern with different radius' in the forums?
2011-02-28T01:35:32  <McLeopold> I need to go look...
2011-02-28T01:35:48  <antimatroid> yeah there is an issue with colliding ants and a small bith/attack radius
2011-02-28T01:36:17  <antimatroid> woah, daniel posted in the forums
2011-02-28T01:36:20  <McLeopold> yea
2011-02-28T01:36:23  <McLeopold> just saw
2011-02-28T01:37:53  <antimatroid> hmmm, i think we need spawn2 = 4
2011-02-28T01:38:12  <antimatroid> i don't really want attack2 >= 9
2011-02-28T01:38:22  <antimatroid> and i don't like colliding enemies
2011-02-28T01:38:35  <antimatroid> it simplifies things for people if they don't need to deal with that
2011-02-28T01:38:39  <McLeopold> Colliding enemies are fine with me, and the engine
2011-02-28T01:38:49  <McLeopold> but your right on simple
2011-02-28T01:39:04  <McLeopold> that gives us a minimum attack of...
2011-02-28T01:39:04  <antimatroid> if somethings harder without making it any more interesting, i consider it unecessary
2011-02-28T01:39:19  <antimatroid> if you have spawn2 = 4 you can have attack2 = whatever
2011-02-28T01:39:35  <antimatroid> i like attack2 = 5, so with your knight moves
2011-02-28T01:39:46  <McLeopold> why spawn = 4?  thats a diamond shape
2011-02-28T01:40:08  <antimatroid> do you want to make both 5?
2011-02-28T01:40:21  <antimatroid> does 6 cancel all rounding errors and keep the same shape?
2011-02-28T01:40:32  <antimatroid> i think it does
2011-02-28T01:41:15  <McLeopold> or 7
2011-02-28T01:41:15  <antimatroid> (view2 = 96, attack2 = 6, spawn2 = 6) == current testing parameters?
2011-02-28T01:41:53  <antimatroid> one isn't going to be that far off calculating rt 6
2011-02-28T01:42:33  <antimatroid> my bot is just going to use the current distance metric squared
2011-02-28T01:42:39  <McLeopold> it just the next radius would be 8
2011-02-28T01:42:55  <McLeopold> the definition is squared anyway, so 5 will do
2011-02-28T01:42:58  <antimatroid> set it to 6 or 7, but are we all okay with that for the moment?
2011-02-28T01:43:00  <McLeopold> if we want that value
2011-02-28T01:43:12  <McLeopold> I'm thinking about it...
2011-02-28T01:43:23  <antimatroid> but then you need people to calcualte rt 5 >= real value
2011-02-28T01:44:19  <antimatroid> you could say ceil(sqrt(dr^2 + dc^2))
2011-02-28T01:47:04  <antimatroid> i just worked out the first thing i can use the first turn for
2011-02-28T01:47:12  <antimatroid> storing distances between all the squares
2011-02-28T01:47:19  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-28T01:47:32  <McLeopold> are you making a giant undirected graph?
2011-02-28T01:47:48  <antimatroid> i've considered it
2011-02-28T01:47:59  <antimatroid> i haven't decided to yet, but i've come close a few times
2011-02-28T01:48:03  <McLeopold> with path finding? because you have to explore first
2011-02-28T01:48:28  <antimatroid> it would just mean checking less edges all the time
2011-02-28T01:48:29  <McLeopold> or, at least the distances will start to increase as you explore
2011-02-28T01:48:33  <antimatroid> but it'd be very messy
2011-02-28T01:49:32  <McLeopold> on a 100x100 map, you need 50million entries
2011-02-28T01:49:39  <antimatroid> shhh :P
2011-02-28T01:49:52  <antimatroid> i think i could do that
2011-02-28T01:49:59  <antimatroid> wouldn't get away with more than that
2011-02-28T01:50:16  <antimatroid> i only need to do it for squares to just outside each squares view
2011-02-28T01:50:19  <antimatroid> might be doable
2011-02-28T01:50:40  <antimatroid> actually, no i couldn't, there goes all my memory :P
2011-02-28T01:51:25  <antimatroid> i'll try later and see how much memory i spend storing distances between squares that are at least almost in view of each other
2011-02-28T01:54:04  <jmcarthur> i think that sounds a bit infeasible, and maybe not even all that useful
2011-02-28T01:54:46  <McLeopold> okay, radius, 93,6,6
2011-02-28T01:55:12  <McLeopold> I'm really thinking that we should stick with this, only unless their is a serious issue with it.
2011-02-28T01:55:12  <antimatroid> McLeopold: where does a bot receive end?
2011-02-28T01:55:25  <antimatroid> is it instead of turn? or after that line? and is that the last line of bot input?
2011-02-28T01:55:40  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2011-02-28T01:55:41  <McLeopold> after they die, or they are the last standing, or after the last turn
2011-02-28T01:55:53  <McLeopold> instead of turn
2011-02-28T01:56:03  <McLeopold> turn means the bot should be sending more orders
2011-02-28T01:56:11  <McLeopold> end means the bot shouldn't
2011-02-28T01:56:31  <antimatroid> that's confusing?
2011-02-28T01:56:40  <McLeopold> not the last line, there is state after it
2011-02-28T01:56:49  <antimatroid> why?
2011-02-28T01:57:08  <antimatroid> so the "winner(s)" can see what happened?
2011-02-28T01:57:18  <jmcarthur> my starter is just ignoring that state. i'm not sure what a bot would be able to do with the state
2011-02-28T01:57:21  <McLeopold> for testing and tcp server
2011-02-28T01:57:32  <McLeopold> on official server, we can just kill the bot
2011-02-28T01:57:42  <McLeopold> the replay will have the final state
2011-02-28T01:57:44  <antimatroid> i am just trying to work out how to get my bot to process it properly
2011-02-28T01:58:19  <McLeopold> you can ignore it
2011-02-28T01:58:23  <McLeopold> i do
2011-02-28T01:58:29  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: when you see "end", the game's over
2011-02-28T01:58:35  <antimatroid> it needs to be specified as well
2011-02-28T01:58:53  <antimatroid> and can you please add the noPlayers after end before scores?
2011-02-28T01:58:54  <McLeopold> or, when you see 'go', do something, otherwise don't
2011-02-28T01:58:56  <jmcarthur> i'm reading the score and making it available, for some reason
2011-02-28T01:59:46  <jmcarthur> i'm considering just dropping that though. makes things much more complicated than necessary
2011-02-28T02:00:09  <McLeopold> yeah, you don't need it, it's just a nice thing the engine will do if you want the info
2011-02-28T02:00:35  <antimatroid> could the end line replace go for a turn?
2011-02-28T02:01:12  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-28T02:01:21  <antimatroid> that way end would always be the last line of input for a bot, so you always know to quit after you've received that, not check whether there is potentially more input to get, the winner could receive the final state info to process etc.
2011-02-28T02:01:31  <McLeopold> so, I added the 'players' line after the 'end' and 'score'
2011-02-28T02:01:38  <antimatroid> cheers
2011-02-28T02:01:45  <McLeopold> hmm... just before score would help

2011-02-28T02:01:51  <antimatroid> i still think it's weird that you "may or may not" have more input after you receive end
2011-02-28T02:02:05  <jmcarthur> damn, that means i have to change mine
2011-02-28T02:02:06  <antimatroid> yeah, i only want it so i know how many scores i'm reading
2011-02-28T02:02:12  <jmcarthur> i'll just stop reading after end, dangit

2011-02-28T02:02:31  <antimatroid> or can we receive go after end even if we died?
2011-02-28T02:02:34  <McLeopold> it's not may or may not
2011-02-28T02:02:35  <antimatroid> that'd be simple and keep me happy
2011-02-28T02:02:49  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: end means you're done
2011-02-28T02:02:52  <antimatroid> and end -> state info -> go for the winner
2011-02-28T02:03:04  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: if you win, end is followed by more input
2011-02-28T02:03:05  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-28T02:03:15  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: which you must respond to?
2011-02-28T02:03:17  <McLeopold> it's not if you win, it's all bots
2011-02-28T02:03:24  <jmcarthur> yeah all bots get it
2011-02-28T02:03:26  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: no response needed
2011-02-28T02:03:28  <jmcarthur> but it's not needed
2011-02-28T02:03:32  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: no, but it's just effort to handle this way, receiving go would make it easier to handle
2011-02-28T02:03:33  <jmcarthur> so just... don't read it
2011-02-28T02:03:41  <jmcarthur> why?
2011-02-28T02:03:54  <jmcarthur> i don't see why receiving go makes anything easier
2011-02-28T02:03:55  <antimatroid> because i can have a "gameover" variable, if "go" and gameover, quite
2011-02-28T02:03:57  <antimatroid> quit*
2011-02-28T02:04:07  <jmcarthur> but why not just quit when you see "end"?
2011-02-28T02:04:10  <antimatroid> otherwise, if end and i'm winner, read another state
2011-02-28T02:04:13  <McLeopold> antimatroid: in python you get an eof error
2011-02-28T02:04:19  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: why read the next state?
2011-02-28T02:04:34  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: the point of receiving the information is so people can use it when testing, if you're providing them something to use, why not make it easier to use?
2011-02-28T02:04:42  <antimatroid> otherwise why even provide the state?
2011-02-28T02:04:49  <jmcarthur> i don't see how anybody will use that state for testing
2011-02-28T02:04:51  <McLeopold> okay, let's say you wanted to read the next state, to fill in info for your neural net bot...
2011-02-28T02:04:54  <antimatroid> if the point is to always ignore it, there's no reason to provide it :\
2011-02-28T02:06:00  <jmcarthur> i guess i will have to reconsider how i'm treating the endgame right now
2011-02-28T02:06:01  <antimatroid> i know i'm annoying, but i don't see why it shouldn't be made easier with the little effort of adding a go line :P
2011-02-28T02:06:13  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: you could still ignore the go line too
2011-02-28T02:06:20  <antimatroid> nothing would change for you
2011-02-28T02:06:28  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: nono, i'm not even reading the last state right now
2011-02-28T02:06:37  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: all i'm getting right now is the score
2011-02-28T02:06:43  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: and it looks like even that will be changing
2011-02-28T02:06:44  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you're right, all add the last go
2011-02-28T02:06:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold: :)
2011-02-28T02:07:02  <antimatroid> i'm happy with everything except battle resolution now :P
2011-02-28T02:08:13  <jmcarthur> okay so i guess the idea now is that the endgame state is just like a normal turn, except starting with "end" instead of "turn X" and containing the score (and player count?)?
2011-02-28T02:09:12  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-28T02:09:32  <jmcarthur> alright. i'll just try to tackle this one later

2011-02-28T02:09:39  <antimatroid> night
2011-02-28T02:09:43  <McLeopold> bye
2011-02-28T02:09:44  <antimatroid> i'll update the wiki
2011-02-28T02:10:38  <McLeopold> the wiki need a lot of updating
2011-02-28T02:10:44  <antimatroid> i know
2011-02-28T02:11:21  <antimatroid> can you update the map file format and visualiser input as needed?
2011-02-28T02:11:27  <McLeopold> I kinda want 'setup' instead of 'turn 0'
2011-02-28T02:11:30  <antimatroid> not needed now, just i don't knowit
2011-02-28T02:11:40  <antimatroid> i'm happy with that
2011-02-28T02:12:07  <McLeopold> rows 82
2011-02-28T02:12:07  <McLeopold> cols 62
2011-02-28T02:12:07  <McLeopold> m %%%
2011-02-28T02:12:13  <McLeopold> that's the map file format ^^
2011-02-28T02:12:17  <antimatroid> do you want noPlayers?
2011-02-28T02:12:37  <McLeopold> it's not needed, I detect starting positions
2011-02-28T02:12:43  <McLeopold> but it is allowed
2011-02-28T02:12:59  <antimatroid> okay, i'll specify it with a "players noPlayers" line
2011-02-28T02:13:18  <antimatroid> i'll leave you to update the visualizer input whenever you find time, it's only needed for you and frontier i'm pretty sure
2011-02-28T02:14:08  <McLeopold> antvalue?  points for a dying ant?  we can take that out
2011-02-28T02:14:24  <antimatroid> depends, did you want it for your scoring?
2011-02-28T02:14:34  <antimatroid> it was there for you :P so remove it if you don't need it
2011-02-28T02:14:50  <McLeopold> hmm... I wonder if a bot should know it's score

2011-02-28T02:15:57  <antimatroid> do you want me to change "turn 0" to "setup" right now?
2011-02-28T02:16:09  <McLeopold> do you think it's good?
2011-02-28T02:16:20  <antimatroid> it might make it more intuitive
2011-02-28T02:16:32  <McLeopold> turn setup?
2011-02-28T02:16:34  <McLeopold> turn end?
2011-02-28T02:16:43  <antimatroid> nah, i expect a number after turn
2011-02-28T02:17:26  <antimatroid> hmm, actually, turn 0 works well for input function?
2011-02-28T02:17:27  <McLeopold> we could take it out
2011-02-28T02:17:32  <antimatroid> and people have already set up with it
2011-02-28T02:17:46  <McLeopold> input function?
2011-02-28T02:18:09  <antimatroid> read turn number, if turn == 0, get parameters, otherwise read state
2011-02-28T02:18:35  <antimatroid> or if turn == end, deal with scores and read state
2011-02-28T02:19:13  <antimatroid> only the winner receives scores don't they?
2011-02-28T02:19:20  <McLeopold> no, everyone
2011-02-28T02:19:33  <McLeopold> I haven't decided if you are beat earlier though
2011-02-28T02:19:37  <antimatroid> how do they get a score when you kill them before the end of the game? or do you let their process run?
2011-02-28T02:19:44  <McLeopold> do you get scores at that time, or hang on for final?
2011-02-28T02:19:52  <antimatroid> otherwise people can do "if dead waste resources"
2011-02-28T02:20:01  <McLeopold> well, for official, kill them
2011-02-28T02:20:15  <McLeopold> but for tcp, I'd might leave the connection open
2011-02-28T02:20:21  <antimatroid> ah okay, i say keep the process running for now, and send everyone end at the end
2011-02-28T02:20:48  <McLeopold> I'll send end and state right away, even on tcp
2011-02-28T02:20:49  <antimatroid> although we need to make sure people's bots don't then crash when being submitted to the main server
2011-02-28T02:21:01  <antimatroid> i guess it doesn't matter if they crash once receiving end?
2011-02-28T02:21:17  <McLeopold> for official, we won't send end, we just kill them
2011-02-28T02:21:35  <antimatroid> so send end, then scores and go come once the game is finished?
2011-02-28T02:22:03  <antimatroid> that way someone can quit and move onto another game on tcp if they like, or wait around for the scores
2011-02-28T02:22:08  <McLeopold> end, state, (wait), scores, go
2011-02-28T02:22:22  <antimatroid> oh, is scores a separate line?
2011-02-28T02:22:26  <McLeopold> yes

2011-02-28T04:39:38  <sigh> ah
2011-02-28T04:39:52  <sigh> maybe the paths should be wider?
2011-02-28T04:40:44  <antimatroid> i actually made those by accident :P
2011-02-28T04:41:43  <antimatroid> i realised that my very naive tree making generator would make a full maze if i told it to add enough walls to run out of feasible ones
2011-02-28T04:44:31  <sigh> haha
2011-02-28T04:44:48  <sigh> at first glance it looks like you actually used a proper maze generating algorithm

2011-02-28T12:29:32  <Frontier> well, I ignorantly assumed that IE 8 has /some/ kind of canvas support, but when I checked yesterday I realized it doesn't.

2011-02-28T13:15:32  <antimatroid> "In order to ensure that people are able to see how well their bot performs relative to the other people who decide to participate in the contest, we encourage people not to share code that specifically implements anything related to the moves a bot would make until final submissions are closed.
2011-02-28T13:15:33  <antimatroid> It is still alright, in fact highly encouraged, for people to share strategy ideas and general tools that people can use, both to improve their bot or enable easier development and debugging."

2011-02-28T14:41:59  <McLeopold> janzert: you around?
2011-02-28T14:43:38  <janzert> sort of, minimally
2011-02-28T14:44:38  <McLeopold> can you tell what the games_archive table was used for?
2011-02-28T14:45:11  <McLeopold> also, can you tell me why you had a map name and a path?  I would have thought just a path would be fine
2011-02-28T14:46:13  <janzert> no idea on the map name/path, that was there before I started and I agree with you
2011-02-28T14:46:46  <McLeopold> okay, also, the rankings and rankings archive?  was the archive just the last set only?
2011-02-28T14:47:35  <janzert> the *_archive tables were because they tables got so large and unwieldy (in particular for the pairing algorithm with games_archive) that operations needed got too slow so old things that no longer needed to be considered for current operation was moved out to the archive
2011-02-28T14:48:36  <janzert> you'll notice things like the game viewer page check first the games table then the games_archive table if it isn't found in the first one
2011-02-28T14:48:39  <McLeopold> okay, so the union of the tables should produce the full set
2011-02-28T14:48:44  <janzert> yep
2011-02-28T14:48:50  <McLeopold> no dups?
2011-02-28T14:49:10  <McLeopold> okay, last question
2011-02-28T14:49:14  <janzert> there would be dups temporarily while moving but not ongoing
2011-02-28T14:49:15  <McLeopold> jail_users?
2011-02-28T14:49:57  <janzert> yes?
2011-02-28T14:50:16  <McLeopold> uh, what is it?
2011-02-28T14:50:22  <janzert> look at the create_jail_users script might clarify that?
2011-02-28T14:50:32  <McLeopold> oh, leaderboard id must have been increasing, like a history?
2011-02-28T14:50:47  <janzert> it is the unix users that are used to run bots under
2011-02-28T14:51:24  <McLeopold> you needed more than one?
2011-02-28T14:51:25  <janzert> the leaderboard_id in rankings?
2011-02-28T14:51:28  <McLeopold> yea
2011-02-28T14:51:56  <janzert> yes, it's actually a foreign key reference to the leaderboard_id in leaderboards
2011-02-28T14:52:07  <janzert> although mysql doesn't do foreign keys
2011-02-28T14:52:27  <McLeopold> I'm pretty sure it does...
2011-02-28T14:52:33  <McLeopold> doesn't matter
2011-02-28T14:52:35  <janzert> ahh, ok
2011-02-28T14:52:53  <janzert> I didn't actually set it up and have little mysql experience overall
2011-02-28T14:53:06  <McLeopold> so, a single database to support both bayeselo and trueskill will be tricky
2011-02-28T14:53:40  <janzert> ahh, looks like innodb engine supports foreign keys. although only myisam was in use last contest
2011-02-28T14:53:53  <janzert> I wouldn't worry about supporting both at the same time
2011-02-28T14:54:08  <janzert> just rip out the bayeselo stuff and support trueskill for ants
2011-02-28T14:54:27  <McLeopold> ok

2011-02-28T17:58:31  <amstan> j3camero: i was planning to move everything from /ants/ to /
2011-02-28T17:59:44  <j3camero> We probably want to keep the other contests. Some of the directories aren't used any more, like third_party, cpp_util. Makefile is also not used.
2011-02-28T18:00:01  <amstan> j3camero: they'll still be in the repository, just not in the way
2011-02-28T18:00:14  <amstan> you can always go back to a previous version
2011-02-28T18:01:03  <amstan> and this is not other contests, i'm talking about go, tic_tac_toe, experimental
2011-02-28T18:01:05  <j3camero> Why not just leave them? Just because we are currently focusing on a certain subdirectory in the course tree doesn't mean that we should delete everything outside that section of the source tree.

2011-02-28T18:02:20  <j3camero> Yeah, tic_tac_toe is not a real contest, sandbox is deprecated, third_party is not used anymore, go never panned out and can probably go, cpp_util is not used anymore.
2011-02-28T18:02:35  <j3camero> planet_wars, ants, and experimental should probably stay though.
2011-02-28T18:03:07  <j3camero> experimental is a neat place to put proof of concept sort of things, when we're not actually developing something that is a production feature.
2011-02-28T18:03:18  <amstan> that should be in branches
2011-02-28T18:03:31  <amstan> that way it's easier to merge in places
2011-02-28T18:03:51  <j3camero> I think that what I'm talking about is conceptually different from a branch.
2011-02-28T18:04:12  <j3camero> Unless branches are really different in git.
2011-02-28T18:04:36  <j3camero> I'm talking about a proof of concept sort of thing, which is not meant to be merged back into the main branch.
2011-02-28T18:04:59  <amstan> well.. why should that stay in the main branch then?
2011-02-28T18:05:25  <j3camero> Because it's part of the codebase.
2011-02-28T18:06:07  <amstan> branches are part of the codebase too. right now, the only thing in experimental is some test with cpu time in python
2011-02-28T18:06:22  <amstan> and i think jbroman has implemented that much nicer in zeta
2011-02-28T18:06:38  <janzert> I agree with amstan most everything except the current contest should be cleared out
2011-02-28T18:07:05  <janzert> but right now I believe there is still a lot of stuff that needs to be brought over from planetwars before removing it
2011-02-28T18:07:35  <amstan> right now i have difficulties deciphering what we're actually using from the old contest, what's useful and what was just forgotten there.
2011-02-28T18:09:58  <j3camero> I guess this is a different model for organizing a repo than I am used to. I don't view the ants contest as a continuation of the planet_wars contest. I think it's a new piece of software. In any case, I guess it's okay to blow it away since we can always resurrect it later.
2011-02-28T18:10:37  <amstan> j3camero: it's not blown away, it'll forever be found at: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/pw
2011-02-28T18:12:09  <j3camero> Yeah I know it's still accessible. It's just not "there" when you check out the code.
2011-02-28T18:12:37  <Zannick> git is fancy and hides branches
2011-02-28T18:12:44  <amstan> git checkout pw
2011-02-28T18:13:28  <j3camero> Yes I realize it's still accessible. It's just not part of "the main thing that gets checked out when you do a clone"
2011-02-28T18:13:44  * Zannick shrugs
2011-02-28T18:13:58  <Zannick> semantics at this point
2011-02-28T18:15:03  <j3camero> I just see it as being messier. For example, support we wanted to use a CI system. When someone changes the planet_wars code, it would not get unit tested. I guess I just object to the use of branches that contain code that is never intended to be merged into the main currently active codebase. To me, that's just another project.
2011-02-28T18:15:08  <j3camero> Yeah it's not a big deal.
2011-02-28T18:15:52  <j3camero> I'm just looking at the endpoint of where this leads, and I see dozens of branches each of which contain a different project. In that case, we should just have different projects.
2011-02-28T18:15:59  <Zannick> i saw it as we have two separate but similar implementations of the contest going on
2011-02-28T18:16:19  <Zannick> where one will be the future one, and the other will be used for this one and then be done

2011-02-28T18:20:55  <amstan_> Zannick: lol..
2011-02-28T18:21:03  <Zannick> mostly because perforce is a little frightening
2011-02-28T18:21:12  <j3camero> Oh no, I don't care for Perforce.
2011-02-28T18:21:16  <jbroman> Google uses Perforce?
2011-02-28T18:21:24  <amstan_> jbroman: apparently
2011-02-28T18:21:25  <j3camero> Oh yeah baby.
2011-02-28T18:21:56  <j3camero> The neatest thing is that there is just one big codebase for the whole company.
2011-02-28T18:22:15  <Zannick> i mean, nearly everything i've ever worked on that wasn't mine to start had something or other i didn't like about it
2011-02-28T18:22:21  <amstan_> jbroman: your call, do we have anything useful in here: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/pw/experimental/python_subprocess_cpu_time
2011-02-28T18:22:36  <j3camero> When you want to work on something, you check out the entire source tree. Of course, there is magic going on behind the scenes such that it does a "lazy checkout" of just the stuff you want.
2011-02-28T18:23:16  <j3camero> It's awesome.
2011-02-28T18:23:27  <jbroman> amstan_: Looks like we're OK to delete that. It's good to preserve stuff in the revision history, but I don't see us needing it.
2011-02-28T18:23:36  <Zannick> i do like the code review enforcement

2011-02-28T18:25:03  <amstan_> j3camero: once people make their own project we can either merge their stuff in, or do the git submodule stuff
2011-02-28T18:25:15  <jbroman> j3camero: Does everyone at Google have access to the entire codebase, or is that per-directory access control within the repository?

2011-02-28T18:25:46  <Zannick> i will disagree with "perfect" but yes

2011-02-28T18:26:29  <jbroman> j3camero: Interesting. That strikes me as very risky.
2011-02-28T18:26:59  <Zannick> readable, not writeable. anyone can commit anywhere, but needs special permission to do so
2011-02-28T18:27:02  <j3camero> jbroman: me too. Yet there have never been any bad leaks. I guess it turns out that most people are trustworthy.
2011-02-28T18:27:27  <jbroman> j3camero: Sure, but could you imagine this headline: "GOOGLE CODEBASE LEAKED"
2011-02-28T18:27:40  <j3camero> Yeah it's true. Could happen.
2011-02-28T18:27:47  <jbroman> (In related news, Bing releases a new version.)
2011-02-28T18:27:55  <j3camero> I guess there are a few practical matters that stop that from happening.
2011-02-28T18:28:29  <amstan> freaking apache... Symbolic link not allowed or link target not accessible
2011-02-28T18:28:39  <j3camero> Like, if you tried to check out the entire source tree it would take forever. I don't know, but it might even stop you from doing that for security reasons. I can't imagine any reason why you would need to check out the whole tree.
2011-02-28T18:28:46  <Zannick> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce
2011-02-28T18:29:26  <McLeopold> hey all, so, I've been doing some sql work to support multi-player
2011-02-28T18:29:39  <amstan> McLeopold: decent
2011-02-28T18:29:45  <McLeopold> maybe...
2011-02-28T18:30:22  <amstan> j3camero, janzert: any of you know if the website likes being ran from a folder? as in.. not directly in the domain(http://something/HERE)
2011-02-28T18:30:49  <Zannick> anyway, i like the git structure we have, despite the branch/project differences
2011-02-28T18:31:15  <janzert> amstan: no idea

2011-02-28T18:31:37  <amstan> Zannick: what branch/project differences?
2011-02-28T18:31:44  <j3camero> amstan: should work fine.
2011-02-28T18:31:50  <Zannick> amstan: i mean, the question whether zeta should be a branch or a separate project
2011-02-28T18:31:58  <j3camero> amstan: I was developing in my CSC webdir last contest. That seemed to work okay.
2011-02-28T18:32:11  <amstan> Zannick: it's easy to split anyway
2011-02-28T18:32:26  <Zannick> yeah, i'm just saying, i like it regardless
2011-02-28T18:32:39  <j3camero> Yeah I don't care so much that we have two different projects as branches. It's a little awkward but poses no problem i practice right now.
2011-02-28T18:32:55  <McLeopold> j3camero: as far as experimental goes, doing a fork/clone of the project is probably the best use of git
2011-02-28T18:33:40  <amstan> why does apache refuse to cooperate? gar
2011-02-28T18:36:14  <j3camero> McLeopold: the experimental subdirectory was meant as a place to put proof of concepts and other experiments that are never meant to be merged into the rest of the codebase. It was not for developing experimental features for example. So the equivalent of that on GitHub would be another GitHub repo that is separate.
2011-02-28T18:36:18  <janzert> amstan, not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but apache disallows following symlinks by default for security reasons. There is a configuration knob to twiddle that allows it to use them but I don't remember what it is.
2011-02-28T18:36:26  <amstan> yeah
2011-02-28T18:36:35  <amstan> janzert: http://pastebin.com/rJQyNDcM
2011-02-28T18:36:55  <amstan> symlinksifownermatch
2011-02-28T18:36:59  <amstan> and i'm pretty sure they do
2011-02-28T18:37:03  <McLeopold> j3camero: then we agree :)
2011-02-28T18:37:12  <j3camero> amstan: yes I recently solved this problem myself. There are some webapps that like to be installed outside the web root that you have to use symlinks for.
2011-02-28T18:37:27  <amstan> oh wait! right.. it's not inside the webroot
2011-02-28T18:37:47  <j3camero> Yeah there is an apache config something or other that you have to do.
2011-02-28T18:37:58  <j3camero> Just google the error message and it's like the first result.
2011-02-28T18:38:04  <amstan> ok.. fuck this, i'll just mount it directly in www

2011-02-28T18:45:22  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i agree with you. if it's not meant to be merged in, it's another project. therefore, i say that instead of being in the same branch or even in a different branch, it should be in an entirely different repository
2011-02-28T18:45:56  <Zannick> j3camero: unless there's been major progress on the website or manager since i last checked, probably not
2011-02-28T18:46:33  <janzert> amstan: I don't know of any up to date skeleton
2011-02-28T18:46:33  <Zannick> not saying it isn't possible to use, but we'd want to dedicate ourselves to using it
2011-02-28T18:47:16  <amstan> wait.. for upcoming? as in.. ants
2011-02-28T18:47:35  <amstan> it would be nice.. but we're really late launching ants
2011-02-28T18:47:40  <amstan> so idk if it's a good idea to rush
2011-02-28T18:48:10  <jmcarthur> we should definitely not rush zeta
2011-02-28T18:48:13  <Zannick> yeah, we should really get ants running with epsilon rather than worry about zeta
2011-02-28T18:48:35  <amstan> if this was january, and we were to set out mind to it, then probably yes
2011-02-28T18:48:38  <amstan> but i think it's too late

2011-02-28T19:50:54  <j3camero> There is one that updates the rankings, like once every two minutes or so.
2011-02-28T19:51:29  <j3camero> Another one that invokes a new tournament manager every 5 minutes. After we started playing games off the main server this one probably went away.
2011-02-28T19:51:47  <j3camero> And another that invokes the compile script every 10 seconds.
2011-02-28T19:51:53  <jmcarthur> wait, what? why wasn't the tournament manager just persistent?

2011-02-28T19:54:35  <amstan> McLeopold: http://pastebin.com/ZaDbqfNj
2011-02-28T19:54:52  <j3camero> Oh brilliant.
2011-02-28T19:54:56  <j3camero> There it is.
2011-02-28T19:55:36  <amstan> McLeopold: contest@server:~$ crontab -l
2011-02-28T19:55:41  <amstan> there might be others, idk
2011-02-28T19:56:00  <j3camero> The thing to remember now though is that the game servers initiate the playing of games.
2011-02-28T19:56:21  <amstan> right.. lol, so nothing there is valid then
2011-02-28T19:57:43  <McLeopold> so...what should I do then?
2011-02-28T19:57:56  <amstan> McLeopold: what are you trying to do? run the whole thing?
2011-02-28T19:57:59  <McLeopold> I need an environment so I can write the engine integration code
2011-02-28T19:58:05  <janzert> all the games are played on workers now
2011-02-28T19:58:19  <McLeopold> so, I need 2 servers then
2011-02-28T19:58:35  <amstan> well, i'm sure you can run both on the same host
2011-02-28T19:58:43  <McLeopold> are we all talking about epsilon and not zeta?
2011-02-28T19:58:47  <janzert> yes
2011-02-28T19:58:48  <amstan> yes
2011-02-28T19:58:50  <McLeopold> ok good
2011-02-28T19:59:11  <amstan> janzert: do you have the crontab of the workers?
2011-02-28T19:59:34  <janzert> hmm, not off hand. it is all set up by the one script though
2011-02-28T19:59:35  <McLeopold> the main server still needs crontab stuff, for rankings and matchmaking, doesn't it?
2011-02-28T19:59:41  <janzert> yes
2011-02-28T19:59:48  <janzert> and compiling currently
2011-02-28T20:00:08  <janzert> although that shouldn't be to hard to make a worker job as well
2011-02-28T20:00:19  <amstan> j3camero: when can we get your server updated to latest ubuntu?
2011-02-28T20:00:34  <janzert> if I remember correctly the only cron jobs for workers is to start the games running on a reboot
2011-02-28T20:01:04  <janzert> and there is a script that just restarts the tournament manager there every 5-10 minutes or so
2011-02-28T20:01:33  <amstan> McLeopold: should be all in /planet_wars/worker
2011-02-28T20:01:52  <amstan> McLeopold: /planet_wars/worker/*.sh
2011-02-28T20:02:34  <janzert> yes, start_worker.sh is run after a worker reboot and starts up the tournament_manager_runner.sh after clearing all jail_users from being in use
2011-02-28T20:03:29  <j3camero> amstan: let's just use EC2 for everything when we launch the next contest.
2011-02-28T20:04:05  <amstan> j3camero: ok, but i still want latest ubuntu
2011-02-28T20:04:53  <j3camero> Yeah that is the idea.
2011-02-28T20:05:43  <j3camero> I love the latest Ubuntu.
2011-02-28T20:10:10  <McLeopold> So, I'm not focusing on the workers right now, I working on a main server.
2011-02-28T20:11:15  <janzert> McLeopold: not sure exactly what you're doing but the engine shouldn't integrate with anything on the main server directly
2011-02-28T20:12:09  <janzert> of course the main server needs the matchmaking code, maybe that's what you're working on
2011-02-28T20:12:23  <janzert> and ranking code and... :)
2011-02-28T20:12:30  <amstan> McLeopold: note planet_wars/worker and planet_wars/backend
2011-02-28T20:13:07  <amstan> McLeopold: they forked from the same code, eventually splitting, but there's redundant files in both of them
2011-02-28T20:13:33  <amstan> the backend should only do main server stuff, and the worker should only be doing worker stuff
2011-02-28T20:13:47  <janzert> the old engine/tournament_manager and other game playing stuff in planet_wars/backend should really just be dropped since it isn't used and bit rotted for the final month of the contest
2011-02-28T20:15:57  <McLeopold> okay, so, if I'm going to create new tables for ranking, I'm going to need a main server and worker
2011-02-28T20:16:15  <McLeopold> Instead of me wasting time, should I just wait for a cleaned up repo?
2011-02-28T20:16:40  <amstan> McLeopold: i cleaned it to most of my knowlege
2011-02-28T20:16:52  <amstan> McLeopold: anything left: i'm not sure what to dow with
2011-02-28T20:17:36  <amstan> actually.. there's more i could do
2011-02-28T20:17:37  <amstan> hmm
2011-02-28T20:17:57  <McLeopold> if janzert says planet_wars/backend ought to be dropped, then it isn't clean
2011-02-28T20:18:13  <amstan> McLeopold: it shouldn't be dropped
2011-02-28T20:18:15  <janzert> pretty sure all the vm* files in backend and worker are really ancient and not used
2011-02-28T20:18:28  <janzert> McLeopold: just certain files should be dropped
2011-02-28T20:18:39  <McLeopold> janzert: can you drop them then?
2011-02-28T20:18:52  <amstan> it's just that.. backend used to contain both the engine and the rankings logic, then it spit, now backend should not contain any more engine logic, and worker should not contain rankings logic
2011-02-28T20:18:58  <janzert> I don't have anything setup with git
2011-02-28T20:19:16  <amstan> i can drop things
2011-02-28T20:19:20  <amstan> if i know what..
2011-02-28T20:19:53  <janzert> yep looks like vm* should definitely go
2011-02-28T20:20:10  <McLeopold> janzert: if you have the time, it would be appreciated.  it should be a clone, rm, commit, push
2011-02-28T20:20:28  <amstan> janzert: your glob matches backend/vmkey.pub, you sure?
2011-02-28T20:20:31  <janzert> tournament_manager* in backend should go
2011-02-28T20:20:35  <janzert> amstan yep
2011-02-28T20:21:03  <janzert> those keys are only used for the old VM sandbox
2011-02-28T20:21:07  <amstan> ok..
2011-02-28T20:21:25  <janzert> actually the latest sandbox doesn't use ssh at all
2011-02-28T20:21:48  <CIA-89> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * rd724877 / (477 files in 16 dirs): removed a lot of stuff - http://bit.ly/e2QKYW
2011-02-28T20:22:33  <McLeopold> amstan: while your at it, can you restore check_submit.php, process_registration.php, register.php and submit.php in the repo to pre finals status.
2011-02-28T20:22:52  <McLeopold> A new server_info key entry of 'allow_submission' would also be nice.
2011-02-28T20:23:05  <amstan> McLeopold: +1, lol
2011-02-28T20:23:56  <janzert> in backend, engine.py and forkbomb.py can go and I think the jail user stuff as well but I'm not completely positive
2011-02-28T20:24:46  <amstan> good thing forkbomb.py didn't have +x
2011-02-28T20:24:53  <amstan> or else it would have killed my comp
2011-02-28T20:24:53  <janzert> that would be create_jail_users.py, delete_jail_users.py, jail_id* and release_all_jail_users.py
2011-02-28T20:25:15  <janzert> heh. yeah, no idea why that was sitting in there
2011-02-28T20:25:24  <j3camero> Testing the sandbox.
2011-02-28T20:26:02  <CIA-89> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * r50ac66a / (14 files in 5 dirs): cleaned some more - http://bit.ly/gPy78U
2011-02-28T20:26:02  <janzert> sure, but having it sitting around in the backend directory seems a little, hmm, risky maybe
2011-02-28T20:26:15  <amstan> janzert: moved it in integration_testing
2011-02-28T20:26:33  <janzert> oh, oops. missed user_sadbox.py in backend as well
2011-02-28T20:26:56  <amstan> janzert: semaphore cleanup?
2011-02-28T20:27:00  <janzert> I think that's it for the backend directory
2011-02-28T20:27:07  <amstan> it is?
2011-02-28T20:27:16  <janzert> no it's needed as long compilation still happens on the main server
2011-02-28T20:27:22  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-02-28T20:27:32  <janzert> the mono compiler leaked semaphores as well as the runtime
2011-02-28T20:27:47  <j3camero> I think we could get away with not doing compilation on the main server amstan
2011-02-28T20:27:48  <janzert> another reason compilation should be moved to workers
2011-02-28T20:28:11  <j3camero> When a bot tries to play its first game, but fails to compile, it will be suspended.
2011-02-28T20:28:15  <janzert> j3camero: for sure, but might as well leave the code there until someone can change it
2011-02-28T20:28:41  <McLeopold> yes, I need a working server/worker combo right now
2011-02-28T20:29:01  <amstan> janzert: so.. assuming backend is clean.. and there's no common files that both the worker and backend need, can i delete everything from worker that's also in backend?
2011-02-28T20:29:43  <Zannick> could we update mono to a version that doesn't leak semaphores?
2011-02-28T20:29:48  <Zannick> if it's been fixed...
2011-02-28T20:29:58  <amstan> Zannick: yeah.. probably
2011-02-28T20:30:00  <janzert> in the worker directory, compile*, forkbomb.py, generate_many_maps.sh, map_generator.py, process_ratings.py, readgames.py, test_compiler.py and update_rankings.py should be able to go
2011-02-28T20:30:17  <amstan> darn.. don't use commas, that was i can copy and paste
2011-02-28T20:30:24  <janzert> Zannick: yeah, as long as we use a newer version of ubuntu we should be fine
2011-02-28T20:30:39  <janzert> oops ;)

2011-02-28T20:31:54  <Zannick> well, i should hope we figure out how to install newer versions that aren't in aptitude
2011-02-28T20:31:57  <Zannick> :P
2011-02-28T20:32:25  <CIA-89> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * r7ac18bd / planet_wars/worker/schema.sql : removed old schema file - http://bit.ly/gCmWRN
2011-02-28T20:32:41  <amstan> supermeatboy is good coding music
2011-02-28T20:32:43  <janzert> amstan: you need that schema.sql for the worker setup script
2011-02-28T20:32:49  <amstan> ok..
2011-02-28T20:32:53  <amstan> time to learn git revert
2011-02-28T20:33:08  <janzert> although I'm pretty sure the only table used on the worker is the jail_user table
2011-02-28T20:33:08  <jmcarthur> no
2011-02-28T20:33:09  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-28T20:33:18  <jmcarthur> amstan: don't use git revert. it's not the same as svn revert
2011-02-28T20:33:19  <janzert> so it could be trimmed down considerably
2011-02-28T20:33:26  <jmcarthur> amstan: you want to read up on git reset
2011-02-28T20:33:39  <amstan> jmcarthur: git reset... won't do nice stuff, i already pushed
2011-02-28T20:33:43  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-28T20:33:44  <jmcarthur> i misunderstood
2011-02-28T20:33:52  <amstan> git revert actually makes a new commit, that reverses another commit
2011-02-28T20:33:54  <jmcarthur> right
2011-02-28T20:34:03  <jmcarthur> i thought you were still local
2011-02-28T20:34:10  <McLeopold> dammit amstan, I just pulled the delete!

2011-02-28T20:35:05  <McLeopold> Okay, so, could we move the 3 directories over to ants?  Then I can start modifying the files there?
2011-02-28T20:35:12  <McLeopold> copy I mean
2011-02-28T20:35:15  <amstan> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4DuAVj85HFc/TV-_x-a-6hI/AAAAAAAAAfw/0kx2NrpvUYo/s1600/everything_went_better_than_expected.jpg
2011-02-28T20:35:32  <jbroman> j3camero: Extremely belatedly (not sure if anyone replied to you), I doubt zeta will be ready for this contest. The one after, hopefully.
2011-02-28T20:35:57  <McLeopold> the 3 being www, backend and worker
2011-02-28T20:36:38  <janzert> hopefully that should make it quite a bit easier for anyone digging into the code to trace what is actually going on

2011-02-28T20:38:27  <j3camero> jbroman: cool thanks.
2011-02-28T20:38:49  <janzert> yay, it looks like zeta now :)
2011-02-28T20:39:07  <amstan> janzert: that was the idea, :D
2011-02-28T20:39:09  <McLeopold> looking good...
2011-02-28T20:39:23  <McLeopold> did we lose the planet_wars engine now?
2011-02-28T20:39:33  <amstan> McLeopold: i think it's still in worker/ somewhere
2011-02-28T20:39:42  <McLeopold> oh
2011-02-28T20:39:45  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-28T20:39:46  <janzert> yep, engine.py in worker/
2011-02-28T20:39:46  <amstan> McLeopold: yep: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/engine.py
2011-02-28T20:40:01  <McLeopold> gotta rip that out of there
2011-02-28T20:40:04  <amstan> McLeopold: you could replace it with some glue code that refers to the ants/ folder
2011-02-28T20:40:17  <amstan> McLeopold: would be nice to have stuff separated

2011-02-28T20:40:40  <amstan> Frontier: were you working on that?
2011-02-28T20:40:43  <McLeopold> Frontier: did you need your changes?
2011-02-28T20:41:07  <Frontier> It was from before when I had write access. It was the addition of 'D'.
2011-02-28T20:41:08  <antimatroid> oh god, so much text
2011-02-28T20:41:19  <amstan> antimatroid: text? where?
2011-02-28T20:41:23  <antimatroid> above me
2011-02-28T20:41:24  <McLeopold> reading logs?
2011-02-28T20:41:43  <Zannick> i assume compile_anything is still somewhere
2011-02-28T20:41:45  <amstan> Frontier: umm.. not sure, i would need to look more into it
2011-02-28T20:41:52  <McLeopold> janzert: would it be safe to say that the worker files don't need to be on the main server
2011-02-28T20:41:55  <amstan> Frontier: i assume it got confused since i moved it around
2011-02-28T20:42:00  <Zannick> so that the server can compile
2011-02-28T20:42:03  <janzert> McLeopold: yes
2011-02-28T20:42:06  <McLeopold> janzert: and that the manager files don't need to be on the workers?
2011-02-28T20:42:10  <janzert> yes
2011-02-28T20:42:12  <Frontier> From what I understand the code remains inactive as long as there is no entry in the languages table corresponding to it
2011-02-28T20:42:42  <amstan> Frontier: try this: git fetch; git checkout epsilon; git reset 3d72f9398f2abe844999ccdb76154619626343fb
2011-02-28T20:43:08  <amstan> Frontier: you'll loose the changes, so feel free to make them again and push
2011-02-28T20:43:09  <Frontier> Oo looks arcane! I'll try moving the file manually first
2011-02-28T20:43:17  <janzert> Zannick: look in manager/
2011-02-28T20:43:22  <amstan> Frontier: just do it my way, it should make sure it's all clean
2011-02-28T20:43:39  <Zannick> janzert: ah, epsilon has manager, now
2011-02-28T20:43:53  <amstan> Zannick: manager/ is the old backend/ folder
2011-02-28T20:43:59  <Zannick> oic
2011-02-28T20:44:03  <amstan> renamed it so it's more clear
2011-02-28T20:45:38  <amstan> well.. i'm bored.. now what?
2011-02-28T20:45:55  <Frontier> amstan: oh that worked well and my changes aren't lost
2011-02-28T20:46:08  <amstan> Frontier: oh.. git reset --hardf
2011-02-28T20:46:14  <amstan> Frontier: oh.. git reset --hard
2011-02-28T20:46:20  <Frontier> Oo
2011-02-28T20:46:22  <amstan> then your changes will be lost
2011-02-28T20:46:27  <amstan> they should be lost..
2011-02-28T20:46:45  <Zannick> um
2011-02-28T20:46:58  <McLeopold> amstan: allow_submission!
2011-02-28T20:47:07  <amstan> McLeopold: right.. that...
2011-02-28T20:47:33  <amstan> but then i need..
2011-02-28T20:47:34  <amstan> ugh
2011-02-28T20:48:00  <McLeopold> shouldn't be too bad
2011-02-28T20:48:45  <amstan> so.. i need to get the db setup, properly this time, get a user, but for user i need email, and email doesn't like my server
2011-02-28T20:48:50  <amstan> so.. i have to disable email somehow
2011-02-28T20:48:56  <McLeopold> it's there
2011-02-28T20:48:59  <McLeopold> hold on...
2011-02-28T20:49:06  <janzert> I already made a setting to disable email
2011-02-28T20:49:15  <janzert> one of the first things I did :P
2011-02-28T20:50:24  <McLeopold> it's in process_submission.php
2011-02-28T20:50:25  <amstan> janzert: oh, decent then
2011-02-28T20:50:29  <McLeopold> $send_email = 0;
2011-02-28T20:50:45  <amstan> so.. can i make a user then? without email confirmation?
2011-02-28T20:50:50  <McLeopold> I have.
2011-02-28T20:51:01  <j3camero> Yeah just put the user in the DB manually.
2011-02-28T20:51:04  <McLeopold> put you have to restore those 4 files to pre-final status.
2011-02-28T20:51:08  <janzert> you should just be able to set a magic name for the email server in the server settings if I remember right
2011-02-28T20:51:35  <amstan> ok.. i will, fine
2011-02-28T20:51:53  <janzert> but I'm having a hard time finding a real process_registration.php file :/
2011-02-28T20:52:03  <amstan> McLeopold: where's that tutorial of yours?
2011-02-28T20:52:16  <McLeopold> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9140666/server_setup.txt
2011-02-28T20:52:21  <McLeopold> but that was for workers
2011-02-28T20:52:28  <McLeopold> and I blame janzert
2011-02-28T20:52:34  <amstan> McLeopold: mysql -u planetwars -p'pwpass' planetwars < schema.sql applies to everything
2011-02-28T20:52:46  <amstan> McLeopold: nvm.. it has www stuff in it too, it's not only workers
2011-02-28T20:53:01  <McLeopold> oh yeah...
2011-02-28T20:53:02  <amstan> someone should work of integrating it in the Readme.md
2011-02-28T20:53:12  * amstan should work on that
2011-02-28T20:53:17  <McLeopold> I can start that, I already have.
2011-02-28T20:53:18  <janzert> actually those server_setup notes are for a main server but from back before I even had any commit access
2011-02-28T20:53:25  <janzert> so are probably fairly outdated
2011-02-28T20:53:48  <janzert> notice it mentions applying the no email patch
2011-02-28T20:54:11  <janzert> that got committed into the actual file once I had write access

2011-02-28T20:55:47  <janzert> ahh, finally. set the mailer_address in server_settings.php to donotsend
2011-02-28T20:56:15  <McLeopold> janzert: I had donotsend, but it still failed a registration
2011-02-28T20:56:16  <janzert> McLeopold: probably
2011-02-28T20:57:14  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm, not sure then since all it does it set $send_email to 0
2011-02-28T20:57:35  <janzert> see line 70'ish of process_registration.php
2011-02-28T20:58:02  <Frontier> I had an easier time with my game replays. They don't even need a valid user thanks to no constraints on the tables.
2011-02-28T20:58:57  <McLeopold> janzert: I see, register with 'donotsend'
2011-02-28T21:00:21  <janzert> no, it's coming out the server settings isn't it?
2011-02-28T21:00:33  <janzert> $server_info["mailer_address"]
2011-02-28T21:00:52  <McLeopold> yeah, it's in there
2011-02-28T21:02:12  <janzert> anyway the current repository version won't do anything but tell you registrations are closed :)

2011-02-28T21:22:51  <antimatroid> i think i can stop editing my starter bot now, i just added in reading the end of game stuff which is just ignored, but now easy for people to use if they want
2011-02-28T21:23:05  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yeah i still haven't done that
2011-02-28T21:23:32  <jmcarthur> i also want to change how the interface handles endgame. haven't decided exactly what to do with that yet
2011-02-28T21:23:43  * janzert thinks the end game results will just encourage bad bot behavior :/
2011-02-28T21:23:51  <antimatroid> janzert: how so?
2011-02-28T21:23:52  <jmcarthur> janzert: how so?
2011-02-28T21:23:53  <janzert> err, still thinks
2011-02-28T21:23:54  <jmcarthur> bah
2011-02-28T21:23:59  <janzert> hehe
2011-02-28T21:24:17  <janzert> people are going to try and update files using that information
2011-02-28T21:24:29  <antimatroid> the server will kill the bot when it sees end
2011-02-28T21:24:35  <antimatroid> it's really there for tcp and local testing
2011-02-28T21:25:10  <antimatroid> i'm actually considering not using dead ant info myself as well, it's messy to get anything from it, and even then you don't get much
2011-02-28T21:25:11  <janzert> yes, I know but I still don't think we should encourage them to try and then complain when it doesn't work
2011-02-28T21:25:34  <janzert> let them gather that information locally outside of the bot
2011-02-28T21:25:44  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure what to do with dead ant info either
2011-02-28T21:25:46  <antimatroid> hmm, i don't know about that
2011-02-28T21:26:07  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: link up who killed who and try to keep some scores
2011-02-28T21:26:20  <jmcarthur> yuck
2011-02-28T21:26:35  <antimatroid> if you see a dead ant on the edge, try to link it to a live ant outside of view to remove a "possibly live opponent"
2011-02-28T21:26:44  <antimatroid> like i said, messy for not much, i am considering just ignoring it
2011-02-28T21:26:51  <jmcarthur> yeah i guess that could be useful
2011-02-28T21:27:02  *** JackyAlcine <JackyAlcine!~JackyAlci@unaffiliated/webjadmin> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-28T21:27:27  <antimatroid> scores are going to be doubles aren't they?
2011-02-28T21:27:53  <jmcarthur> oh? i've been parsing them as natural numbers
2011-02-28T21:28:17  <antimatroid> well if we want integer points, each ant needs to be valued like lcm(2, 3, ..., 8) or so
2011-02-28T21:28:34  <antimatroid> so the proportions for killing an ant can be split among hte "killing" ants as an integer
2011-02-28T21:28:38  <jmcarthur> i don't even know the scoring system
2011-02-28T21:29:03  <antimatroid> if an ant dies, give an equal proportion of its points to any enemy ants in its attack range, then those ants pass their points onto their owner
2011-02-28T21:29:17  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-28T21:29:23  <antimatroid> there is a food bonus as the end for any surviving bots, but that's not as important
2011-02-28T21:29:41  <antimatroid> i also think that scoring method makes a lot more sense with battle option 1
2011-02-28T21:30:59  <antimatroid> i think it's an awesome game with battle option 1 and that scoring method though :(, i just need to convince jeff
2011-02-28T21:31:04  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: oh btw, your c++ starter pack is smaller than my haskell starter pack + library. thought you might get some enjoyment out of that
2011-02-28T21:31:27  <antimatroid> without all your comments?
2011-02-28T21:31:30  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-28T21:31:33  <antimatroid> :p
2011-02-28T21:31:34  <jmcarthur> h/o lemme sloccount it
2011-02-28T21:31:39  <antimatroid> c++ <3
2011-02-28T21:32:04  <antimatroid> did you do a horribly long getLocation function? or use an array like mine?
2011-02-28T21:32:28  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yours is 311 lines. mine is 464 lines.
2011-02-28T21:32:39  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: on the other hand, mine is over twice as fast as yours :P
2011-02-28T21:32:54  <antimatroid> is that just because of me using iostreams?
2011-02-28T21:33:04  <antimatroid> i could change that, but it only needs to run once per turn so meh
2011-02-28T21:33:05  <jmcarthur> i do think you're spending a lot more time on I/O than i am
2011-02-28T21:33:15  <antimatroid> and i'm comparing strings a lot
2011-02-28T21:33:19  <jmcarthur> but i also use less cpu time than you
2011-02-28T21:33:44  <jmcarthur> it's like over twice as fast wall clock time and 16% or so faster by cpu time
2011-02-28T21:33:49  <antimatroid> i'm going to have a good play with your haskell bot once everything is set up
2011-02-28T21:34:02  <jmcarthur> brb
2011-02-28T21:51:11  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: did you leave everything untouched when you ran it?
2011-02-28T21:51:32  <antimatroid> i just remembered the bug file is probably really expensive, it's flushing everything it gets because i can't work out how to pass it endl
2011-02-28T21:51:57  <antimatroid> there is a debug variable in Bug.h that can switch that off... :P
2011-02-28T21:57:08  <antimatroid> i imagine that debug thing is fairly costly too
2011-02-28T21:57:16  <antimatroid> oops, was scrolled up :P

2011-02-28T22:08:17  <antimatroid> my general template function wont take it :\
2011-02-28T22:08:28  <jbroman> antimatroid: I think there are multiple endls.
2011-02-28T22:08:42  <antimatroid> with c++?
2011-02-28T22:09:06  <antimatroid> it's some kind of function that also flushes stuff, i just have no idea how they get ostreams to take it now

2011-02-28T22:09:19  <janzert> no, idea. I'm pretty sure it's a template itself
2011-02-28T22:09:23  <jbroman> antimatroid: Trying to find reference, but I heard somewhere that there are multiple implementations of endl, and the correct one is selected.
2011-02-28T22:09:30  <janzert> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/manipulators/endl/
2011-02-28T22:10:45  <janzert> I'm not terribly proficient in c++ and don't much care for iostreams so have mostly just avoided them
2011-02-28T22:10:58  <janzert> the iostream << syntax that is
2011-02-28T22:11:12  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough, i like the iostream syntax, hate the inefficiency of it
2011-02-28T22:11:15  <jbroman> antimatroid: What's the code you're having trouble with?
2011-02-28T22:11:21  <_flag> Why not use "\n"? /cprogrammer
2011-02-28T22:11:29  <jbroman> _flag: For one, std::endl flushes.
2011-02-28T22:11:30  <antimatroid> _flag: i want it to flush as well
2011-02-28T22:11:51  <_flag> fflush(stdout)?
2011-02-28T22:11:57  <amstan> isn't it also cross platform?
2011-02-28T22:12:02  <jbroman> _flag: Yes, it's equivalent to writing "\n" and then doing fflush.
2011-02-28T22:12:07  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i left it untouched, yes. the bug stuff might indeed be a bottleneck
2011-02-28T22:12:11  <antimatroid> _flag: i'm currently doing that every time i debug something
2011-02-28T22:12:13  <jbroman> amstan: I'm pretty sure fflush is also cross-platform, though I haven't checked.

2011-02-28T22:12:15  <amstan> as in.. might also use \r from time to time
2011-02-28T22:12:31  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i basically just built it with -O3 and ran it with the contents of a file as input
2011-02-28T22:12:55  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: want to try turning off debug in the bot.h constructer for me? i'm worried about it now :P

2011-02-28T22:13:13  <amstan> k, i'm bored again, any ideas on what i can do?
2011-02-28T22:13:16  <jbroman> amstan: I thought it was always \n, but I haven't read the spec.
2011-02-28T22:13:30  <amstan> jbroman: i'm just saying.. maybe it uses \r\n on windows
2011-02-28T22:13:40  <antimatroid> amstan: this is meant to be a starter bot for c++ :P
2011-02-28T22:13:43  <amstan> whereas, if you just get "\n", it's hardcoded
2011-02-28T22:14:02  <antimatroid> and \r\n hasn't worked for me in the past, otherwise i'd just define
2011-02-28T22:14:03  <antimatroid> const string endline = "\r\n"
2011-02-28T22:14:26  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: err... i don't see what to do. Bot.h doesn't appear to contain anything to do with debug

2011-02-28T22:16:38  <janzert> another probably easier thing to work on is generalize and adapt the worker setup script so it will work again

2011-02-28T22:17:40  <jmcarthur> and my laptop hard drive
2011-02-28T22:17:57  <antimatroid> yeah, but i need to fix that flush problem
2011-02-28T22:18:06  <antimatroid> it's flushing every time it outputs a character from the state aha

2011-02-28T22:35:25  <jbroman> I don't think std::endl (a templated function) matches the class template, which is why it didn't work as you had it.
2011-02-28T22:36:14  <jbroman> Urrg...change "if (debugging)" to "if (bug.debugging)"
2011-02-28T22:37:22  <amstan> you mean if DEBUGGING
2011-02-28T22:37:34  <amstan> should be a define
2011-02-28T22:37:51  <jbroman> amstan: I was modifying his code.
2011-02-28T22:38:43  <jbroman> Perhaps for his use-case, he may need to enable debugging at runtime (e.g. based on an environment variable). *shrug*
2011-02-28T22:42:50  <CIA-89> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * rd5977e1 / (2 files in 2 dirs): moved the forkbomb - http://bit.ly/i0mJgR
2011-02-28T22:42:52  <CIA-89> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * ra3737ad / (.gitmodules trueskill): added trueskill submodule - http://bit.ly/gsrPTW
2011-02-28T22:45:59  <antimatroid> should probably just be a constant
2011-02-28T22:46:11  <antimatroid> i'm getting a multiple definition error when i add that function, even if i remove the other one :\
2011-02-28T22:46:13  <antimatroid> bloody c++
2011-02-28T22:46:16  <antimatroid> i'll have a play, thanks
2011-02-28T22:46:19  <amstan> antimatroid: it should be a #define, that way you can set it in the makefile
2011-02-28T22:48:30  <antimatroid> it's working, but it makes me put non-template << functions in .cc and :\
2011-02-28T22:48:34  <antimatroid> i don't understand that at all
2011-02-28T22:48:59  <jbroman> I am not a C++ guru, but I don't think functions match template <class T>.
2011-02-28T22:49:33  <antimatroid> yeah no i understand that
2011-02-28T22:51:45  <antimatroid> jbroman: all working now, thanks :)
