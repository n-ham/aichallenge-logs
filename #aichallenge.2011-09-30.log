2011-09-30T02:09:56  <janzert> McLeopold: I think the fix to population count is counting all hives, including those of players that don't have any remaining hills?
2011-09-30T02:10:32  <McLeopold> ?
2011-09-30T02:10:47  <McLeopold> yeah, probably
2011-09-30T02:11:29  <janzert> lines 1464 and 1465 of ants.py now
2011-09-30T02:12:09  <janzert> it seems like it should have a conditional to only count hives that still have an active hill
2011-09-30T02:15:13  <janzert> btw, for anyone interested in Clojure, Clojure itself now seems to be working on the servers but the starter bot crashes

2011-09-30T02:18:04  <McLeopold> janzert: and I just restarted the workers :(
2011-09-30T02:19:05  <McLeopold> janzert: I should probably check that they are alive too?
2011-09-30T02:19:08  <janzert> I'll update them manually when they get back up
2011-09-30T02:19:32  <McLeopold> I never did before
2011-09-30T02:19:53  <McLeopold> I'm thinking not
2011-09-30T02:19:57  <janzert> for changes that don't effect the setup, you can just manually download and unpack the tgz from the server
2011-09-30T02:20:13  <McLeopold> I could
2011-09-30T02:20:27  <janzert> shutdown the worker script first then start it afterwards too of course
2011-09-30T02:20:30  <McLeopold> maybe a script? and a nice log on message reminder :)
2011-09-30T02:21:28  <janzert> well, I usually shutdown the worker nicely with a stop_worker file so if using an automatic script it could take quite a while to complete
2011-09-30T02:21:46  <janzert> also it wouldn't restart worker.py in a screen session
2011-09-30T02:22:19  <janzert> well it could all be worked out but would get rather complex
2011-09-30T02:22:29  <McLeopold> mayby next year...
2011-09-30T02:23:23  <janzert> ideally make it another task for the worker so it can be triggered automatically from the main server :)
2011-09-30T02:23:35  <McLeopold> yeah!
2011-09-30T02:23:44  <janzert> I thought about that briefly the other day, but it would get fairly tricky
2011-09-30T02:24:11  <McLeopold> you'd have to pass control to an update program and kill yourself
2011-09-30T02:24:18  <McLeopold> or something like that
2011-09-30T02:24:30  <janzert> something
2011-09-30T02:24:37  * janzert nods
2011-09-30T02:24:44  <McLeopold> if we ever do jeffs vision of submitting games, it's something we would want
2011-09-30T02:25:26  <janzert> yeah, and would require significant rework in security too
2011-09-30T02:25:38  <janzert> all game code needs to be sandboxed as well
2011-09-30T02:25:38  <McLeopold> jail users?
2011-09-30T02:25:43  <McLeopold> oh, yeah
2011-09-30T02:26:52  <McLeopold> janzert: did you see my horrible probably_score bug?
2011-09-30T02:27:06  <McLeopold> Just as bad as the food spawning on hills bug
2011-09-30T02:27:14  <janzert> I saw something about it but didn't really look at it
2011-09-30T02:27:19  <McLeopold> I write some really crappy code sometimes

2011-09-30T02:27:38  <McLeopold> I didn't copy the list, so I was modifying scores directly
2011-09-30T02:27:59  <McLeopold> the spawn code was continuing the inner loop, instead of the outer
2011-09-30T02:28:07  <McLeopold> dumb stuff
2011-09-30T02:28:10  <janzert> oops
2011-09-30T02:28:30  <McLeopold> so, that means most of the stats on extended games is probably wrong
2011-09-30T02:29:43  <janzert> being extended games are only around 1% of the total games, from a practical game length perspective, I'm not really worried about it
2011-09-30T02:29:56  <janzert> still think the rule makes no sense though :P
2011-09-30T02:30:10  <McLeopold> me neither, I'm just really interested to see a come from behind game :)
2011-09-30T02:30:11  <janzert> but I'll just refer questions about it to someone else
2011-09-30T02:30:56  <janzert> oh that reminds me
2011-09-30T02:31:33  <McLeopold> if at some point, people complain about not enough games, we can just kill the bots without hills, but let's wait if it actually becomes an issue
2011-09-30T02:31:36  <janzert> I think the section in the game specification called Cutoffs should be renamed to something like "End Game Conditions"
2011-09-30T02:31:47  <McLeopold> Sure
2011-09-30T02:32:08  <McLeopold> That was all written after midnight, I was just trying to get the info out there
2011-09-30T02:32:18  <janzert> it won't add hardly any games though since it will effect only ~1% of games
2011-09-30T02:32:22  <janzert> ok
2011-09-30T02:32:46  <McLeopold> It would be nice if we could get interwiki links to transfer over, but I think we'll need to do hard links
2011-09-30T02:33:25  <antimatroid> McLeopold: how do you feel about me changing "attack enemy ants if within range" to "battle enemy ants if within range"?
2011-09-30T02:33:37  <McLeopold> do you know of a good code formatting tool?  I was thinking a jQuery plugin for the tutorials
2011-09-30T02:33:37  <janzert> I think the only way to significantly shorten games is going to be finding ways that max turn games can be shortened
2011-09-30T02:33:39  <antimatroid> i think the resolution resembles battles more than ants necessarily attcking each other
2011-09-30T02:33:47  <janzert> but I haven't had any really pop out yet
2011-09-30T02:33:52  <janzert> other than map design issues
2011-09-30T02:34:52  <janzert> McLeopold: http://pygments.org/ is the only one I really know of, not sure how to integrate it though
2011-09-30T02:34:53  <McLeopold> antimatroid: We should probably try ant be consistant, I prefer "attack" as an action an ant is doing, and "battle" as the whole configuration of the board
2011-09-30T02:35:17  <McLeopold> yeah, but that is python
2011-09-30T02:35:43  <janzert> right, it would be need to be done in the page generation stage

2011-09-30T02:38:34  <McLeopold> janzert: we could do a "no ant population % movement" cutoff.  If all bots maintain the same percentage of ants, stop the game?
2011-09-30T02:39:08  <McLeopold> distance to enemy hills?
2011-09-30T02:39:24  <McLeopold> I'd have to look at the max_turns games...
2011-09-30T02:40:38  <antimatroid> "The game will continue if the only bot with a hill isn't winning yet." is that a typo?
2011-09-30T02:40:49  <antimatroid> how can that bot then cahgne the outcome if they can't gain more points?
2011-09-30T02:40:57  <McLeopold> cahgne?
2011-09-30T02:41:04  <antimatroid> change
2011-09-30T02:41:13  <antimatroid> shouldn't it be the game will continue if the only bot with a hill can be beaten still?
2011-09-30T02:41:17  <McLeopold> oh, totally couldn't figure that out :)
2011-09-30T02:41:30  <antimatroid> or what about if the other places in the game could still change?
2011-09-30T02:41:43  <McLeopold> antimatroid: there is a way
2011-09-30T02:42:15  <antimatroid> i don't see how? they can only lose points from losing one of their remaining hills no?

2011-09-30T02:42:24  <McLeopold> if 1 bot has no hills and is winning, and another has no ants, but still has a hill, and a 3rd has bot and can take out the second to get first place...
2011-09-30T02:42:31  <antimatroid> whereas the other bots could take out the hill(s) giving them points
2011-09-30T02:42:40  <McLeopold> but, that sentence is wrong
2011-09-30T02:43:55  <antimatroid> here's my thoughs, player 1 has no hills and 10 points, player 2 has a hill and 12 points, then player 1 takes out player 2's hill before the end making the score 12-11?
2011-09-30T02:44:05  <McLeopold> it should say, the only alive bot with a hill
2011-09-30T02:44:29  <antimatroid> but what about my example above?
2011-09-30T02:44:38  <antimatroid> aren't you taking the chance from player 2 to win the game fairly?
2011-09-30T02:44:42  <McLeopold> is it a 2 player game?
2011-09-30T02:44:48  <antimatroid> doesn't matter
2011-09-30T02:44:53  <McLeopold> yes it does
2011-09-30T02:44:55  <antimatroid> this could be two players ranked anywhere among the rest
2011-09-30T02:45:00  <antimatroid> fact is the outcome could still change
2011-09-30T02:45:15  <McLeopold> if a bot with a hill can gain in rank, the game continues
2011-09-30T02:45:29  <antimatroid> what about a bot without a hill which can gain in rank?
2011-09-30T02:45:33  <antimatroid> that's what my example is
2011-09-30T02:45:42  <McLeopold> we might stop the game
2011-09-30T02:45:50  <antimatroid> i don't think it should be stopped :P
2011-09-30T02:46:11  <janzert> the general idea is that players that have lost their hills shouldn't effect whether the game continues or not
2011-09-30T02:46:23  <antimatroid> player 1 could be really close to taking player 2's hill when someone else takes out player 1's last hill
2011-09-30T02:46:33  <janzert> it's a lesser effect than simply removing them
2011-09-30T02:46:36  <antimatroid> i think you're cutting the game short too fast
2011-09-30T02:47:02  <McLeopold> antimatroid: we've got code to test that, and it doesn't usually change the rank so far
2011-09-30T02:47:20  <antimatroid> if you've got code to test it why not stop the game when the outcome can't change?
2011-09-30T02:48:01  <antimatroid> anyway, you guys are aware of what I mean now, I don't mind too much so I wont push it :()
2011-09-30T02:48:03  <antimatroid> :)*
2011-09-30T02:48:31  <McLeopold> It needs to be specified clearly that a main objective will be to hold on to your hills
2011-09-30T02:48:53  <antimatroid> i thought the objective was to both defend and attack? :P
2011-09-30T02:48:58  <McLeopold> it is
2011-09-30T02:49:10  <McLeopold> *a* main, not *the* main
2011-09-30T02:49:38  <McLeopold> if you lose your hills, you won't be garrenteed the time to make attacks
2011-09-30T02:50:11  <McLeopold> antimatroid: did you notice that if you have ants in the hive, your hill can't be taken?
2011-09-30T02:50:37  <antimatroid> i hadn't, but yeah okay
2011-09-30T02:50:56  <McLeopold> spawn happens before move, so you always have a defender
2011-09-30T02:50:59  <antimatroid> you could actually play a game with them on that
2011-09-30T02:51:44  <McLeopold> if you lost control of you hill area, but had most of the map, and the spawn rate was high enough, you could theoretically never lose your hill
2011-09-30T02:52:37  <antimatroid> yeah, that will be cool to see
2011-09-30T02:52:49  <antimatroid> i think that'd be cooler if people could easily choose where to spawn :P
2011-09-30T02:52:54  <antimatroid> but oh well
2011-09-30T02:53:22  <McLeopold> well, they wouldn't actually take out any enemies, just delay the razing
2011-09-30T02:54:03  <antimatroid> it'd give them time to reclaim the territory before the enemy razed the hill
2011-09-30T02:54:10  <McLeopold> how's the tutorial coming?
2011-09-30T02:54:16  <antimatroid> :)
2011-09-30T02:54:22  <antimatroid> it's friday night, i'll try and do it tonight
2011-09-30T02:54:26  <McLeopold> cool
2011-09-30T02:54:27  <antimatroid> (only 5pm_
2011-09-30T02:54:38  <McLeopold> it's not yet friday for me
2011-09-30T02:55:26  <McLeopold> gotta sleep now, cya
2011-09-30T02:55:30  <antimatroid> ciao

2011-09-30T09:51:57  <sir_macelon> eashoka: good afternoon :)
2011-09-30T09:55:27  <mcstar> java guys seem to be very polite
2011-09-30T09:56:55  <UncleVasya> hi
2011-09-30T09:57:57  <UncleVasya> @seen Smiley1983
2011-09-30T09:57:57  <contestbot> UncleVasya: Smiley1983 was last seen in #aichallenge 1 day, 18 hours, 50 minutes, and 42 seconds ago: <smiley1983> another time, though, time for me to sleep now (or preferably, three hours ago)
2011-09-30T10:06:21  <eashoka> msctar : java is for enterprise and is type safe, may be that's why. :-)
2011-09-30T10:07:31  <mcstar> esahoka : your probably light
2011-09-30T10:08:41  <mcstar> someone told me there are "protocols" in java, or interfaces if you like, i saw the analogy there
2011-09-30T10:09:33  <eashoka> mcstar : you are probably right :-)

2011-09-30T10:19:51  <mcstar> "I will talk with you with pleasure."
2011-09-30T10:19:58  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-30T10:20:05  <mcstar> are you trying to hook up with a girl?
2011-09-30T10:20:35  <UncleVasya> Delin - my friend (InsaneMalkavian). "psm" is a shortened "posmotri" wich translates from Russian as "do watch". Vizov is the name of good Russian movie.
2011-09-30T10:23:52  <mcstar> i see you didnt prepare your bot to handle the new conditions either

2011-09-30T10:24:18  <mcstar> and its very unlikely to find any girls here
2011-09-30T10:25:13  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: hi. Maybe it's a good idea to keep info about hills in the fog of war by default in starter pack?

2011-09-30T10:27:57  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: I've done it this way:
2011-09-30T10:28:01  <mcstar> i just noticed your ants pile up in the base
2011-09-30T10:29:15  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: do you mean keeping the hill information between turns rather than forgetting it?
2011-09-30T10:31:24  <mcstar> lets leave some work for the poor contestants who will use your starter kit too
2011-09-30T10:33:58  <smiley1983> since the contestant has to manage previously-seen food themselves, it makes sense for them to have to do the same for hills
2011-09-30T10:34:02  <UncleVasya> I keep the list of hillsfrom past turn. But the map squares with hills are still updated every turn. After call to UpdateVision I call UpdateHills that makes a list that consist of (Hills we currently see + Hills in the fog of war).

2011-09-30T10:35:17  <smiley1983> Question about updating map squares: if there's an ant on a hill, do you create a new value for the map, or only include one of them?
2011-09-30T10:35:38  <smiley1983> Currently the map tile variety is just an int
2011-09-30T10:36:15  <smiley1983> so for the starter pack, I'm just making lists of my_hills and enemy_hills, and leaving the map unchanged
2011-09-30T10:42:28  <UncleVasya> Currently in bot's logic I use only a list of hills so I prefer to stole ant in the map square instead of hill. Maybe it will change in future and I will think about keeping them both.
2011-09-30T10:43:50  <smiley1983> I think the starter can be kept simple though - most of the other starters will do the same, I think
2011-09-30T10:46:37  *** javagamer is now known as rofer
2011-09-30T10:49:55  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: I think a possible way is to make methods like state#is_hill, state#is_ant.
2011-09-30T10:53:40  <UncleVasya> and make an integer value for Ant+Hill  in mapb.content. So the function is_hill  returns true in case when  content = hill_value  or  content = Ant+Hill value.
2011-09-30T10:58:44  <UncleVasya> And if you'll add a tile `AntHill you don't need to keep is_hill and is_ant as state's methods. You can put them in a place you put not_water function in the top of MyBot.ml.
2011-09-30T11:00:26  <UncleVasya> mcstar: why they are poor?
2011-09-30T11:02:52  <UncleVasya> Can you tell me about relationship between my ants and enemy hills?
