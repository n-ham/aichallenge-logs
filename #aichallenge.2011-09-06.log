2011-09-06T09:29:53  <boegel> I wonder how challenging the assignments will be
2011-09-06T09:30:02  <boegel> the aiclass twitter feed mentions 10h/week
2011-09-06T09:30:08  <boegel> which is way more than I can spare
2011-09-06T09:37:37  <mathis> I'm taking the basic track of aiclass.com
2011-09-06T09:43:41  <boegel> I'll try to take the advanced track, but will probably have to switch to the basic track
2011-09-06T09:44:04  <boegel> I can give it a try though, who knows, maybe I can sleep 10h a week and not die
2011-09-06T09:44:22  <aerique> if the challenge starts during the ai-class, the challenge will go on the bak burner for me
2011-09-06T09:44:31  <aerique> unfortunate timing
2011-09-06T10:04:56  <mcstar> if back burner is like after-burner than its a good thing :D

2011-09-06T11:36:36  <antimatroid> it was on my bed

2011-09-06T11:37:00  <mcstar> well, a man at some point in his/her life must decide what he/she dislikes most: spiders or flies
2011-09-06T11:37:04  <mcstar> i chose flies
2011-09-06T11:37:27  <mcstar> that means i let spiders live
2011-09-06T11:37:29  <antimatroid> flies aren't a problem for me
2011-09-06T11:37:42  <mcstar> oh, well, they are for me
2011-09-06T11:37:46  <antimatroid> but i normally do my best to not hurt animals, but a spider invading my bed was over the line
2011-09-06T11:37:47  <mcstar> and they are nastier
2011-09-06T11:38:22  <mcstar> do you believe that common myth that spiders crawl into your mouth when you sleep?

2011-09-06T11:41:15  <antimatroid> lol
2011-09-06T11:41:20  <antimatroid> i was told 8 per lifetime

2011-09-06T11:41:30  <mcstar> vastly different
2011-09-06T11:42:23  <mcstar> and there was another statistics, on average a person eats a shovel of dust in a decade(lifetime?)
2011-09-06T11:42:40  <mcstar> whats that other thing that comes with the broom?
2011-09-06T11:42:45  <mcstar> not shovel but similar

2011-09-06T17:16:20  <mleise> McLeopold: Yeah, I'm asking because with fog of war the Java visualizer is quite slow and will forward that on to the engine
2011-09-06T17:22:15  <McLeopold> forward the slowness?
2011-09-06T17:35:58  <mleise> McLeopold: yes, I don't buffer the data
2011-09-06T17:37:39  <mleise> i just read it from the pipe and wait for the visualizer to draw a frame. It could be that the engine has to wait there on a write() for a second.
2011-09-06T17:38:00  <mleise> Will that affect bots?
2011-09-06T17:38:26  <McLeopold> is this play_one_game_live?
2011-09-06T17:38:58  <mleise> I still have to see what has to be done if delt0r's tcp server needs a client visualizer. Yes, that is the file I added to make it easier ;)

2011-09-06T18:10:40  <delt0r_> its java
2011-09-06T18:10:48  <delt0r_> and it is fast

2011-09-06T18:12:00  <mleise> We still have our Java requires tons of virtual memory dogma
2011-09-06T18:12:27  <delt0r_> So your VM is crap at mem managment... meh
2011-09-06T18:13:01  <delt0r_> Java may not be "fast" but then niether is C++.... Fortran for the win ;)
2011-09-06T18:13:24  <delt0r_> seriously.... 99% of performance is the programmer --not the lang
2011-09-06T18:13:40  <delt0r_> except for PHP and perl :P
2011-09-06T18:18:27  <mleise> delt0r_: remember all the Java bot crashes on the test server? That's what happens when virtual memory is exhausted
2011-09-06T18:19:03  <delt0r_> which is a fault of the sand box ---get with 2011... virtual is not real
2011-09-06T18:19:04  <mleise> one bot was practically eating up all the available memory
2011-09-06T18:19:16  <delt0r_> virtual is not real

2011-09-06T22:49:17  <pgpaskar> Where was it that you said you're going now?
2011-09-06T22:49:18  <amstan> hey
2011-09-06T22:49:22  <pgpaskar> Instead of udubz
2011-09-06T22:49:23  <amstan> mohawk college
2011-09-06T22:49:30  <amstan> udubz?
2011-09-06T22:49:39  <amstan> what's udubz?
2011-09-06T22:49:40  <pgpaskar> udubz=u double u =uw
2011-09-06T22:49:48  <amstan> lol
2011-09-06T22:49:49  <pgpaskar> nvm >]
2011-09-06T22:49:49  <amstan> ok
2011-09-06T22:50:09  <pgpaskar> Your absence was noted in #csc and I remember you told me but I forgot the name
2011-09-06T22:59:39  <pgpaskar> yay something positive came from something i did.  that rarely occurs
2011-09-06T22:59:47  <pgpaskar> thats why i tend not to do things
2011-09-06T23:07:59  <amstan> pgpaskar: lol
2011-09-06T23:37:13  <mleise> there is some git merge conflict on the test server around 'sql/2_generate_matchup.sql'
2011-09-06T23:41:11  <amstan> mleise: i could look at it
2011-09-06T23:42:43  <amstan> mleise: you're just trying to update, right?
2011-09-06T23:43:03  <amstan> mleise: not doing anything funny like making commits on the server?
2011-09-06T23:43:04  <mleise> yes, probably it is no real conflict
2011-09-06T23:43:29  <mleise> I'd never commit from the server ^^
2011-09-06T23:43:36  <amstan> mleise: done
2011-09-06T23:43:55  <amstan> mleise: i git reset $file and git checkout $file
2011-09-06T23:44:00  <amstan> then pulled
2011-09-06T23:44:21  <mleise> What if someone was working on that file on the server!?
2011-09-06T23:44:34  <amstan> mleise: they're not really supposed to
2011-09-06T23:45:28  <amstan> mleise: also, what's inside sql/ is only applicable to the setup part
2011-09-06T23:45:36  <mleise> ok... I hope they know that. I think for the database stuff it is convenient to modify queries dierctly on the server
2011-09-06T23:45:51  <amstan> wait, nvm
2011-09-06T23:45:55  <amstan> not the generate_sql part
2011-09-06T23:46:00  <mleise> generate_matchup sounds like it ... you say it
2011-09-06T23:46:17  <mleise> you just deleted someones work of several hours
2011-09-06T23:47:25  <mleise> generate_matchup.sql could be work in progress for the current bugs around player matching
2011-09-06T23:49:11  <amstan> i'm sorry, but on the server, uncommited and which causes a conflict shouldn't really be left like that, especially if extensive work was done
2011-09-06T23:54:28  <mleise> maybe that person had a copy :)
