2011-08-09T20:49:18  <blankrider> hey all, i'm having issues getting the test_bot.cmd to work, and my bot is crashing when i use play_one_game
2011-08-09T20:49:24  <blankrider> I am working with a java based bot
2011-08-09T20:54:28  <blankrider> I have tried to make a jar, use java with the MyBot.class, use java -cp and specify the CP
2011-08-09T20:56:25  <blankrider> Here are the errors when i run test_bot.cmd http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/7416/errorbt.png
2011-08-09T20:58:29  <_flag> Well it says your map has an incorrect number of rows, so you're probably using a bad map
2011-08-09T21:02:00  <blankrider> im just using the default test_bot that was given in the tools package
2011-08-09T21:02:20  <_flag> What python version are you using?
2011-08-09T21:03:05  <blankrider> 2.7.2
2011-08-09T21:06:58  <_flag> Well I'm not sure then. I'm not sure how many people here are Windows users, so it could be that things are simple under-tested on Windows. Try looking at the map that's being used and see if there's a reason you might not be able to parse it correctly
2011-08-09T21:08:02  <janzert> maybe pastebin the contents of test_bot.cmd to double check the command line that is being used
2011-08-09T21:08:05  <blankrider> wtf
2011-08-09T21:08:12  <blankrider> now it says test.map requires 2 players
2011-08-09T21:08:17  <blankrider> yet it clearly says players 1
2011-08-09T21:08:26  <blankrider> I feel like the .cmd files themselves are glitchy
2011-08-09T21:09:07  <janzert> test_bot.cmd should play your bot against a very simple test bot on the test_map
2011-08-09T21:09:10  <blankrider> for instance, playgame.cm uses %~dp0 to specify the folder but test_bot does not.  test_bot will not correctly run stock
2011-08-09T21:09:40  <blankrider> I might be incorrectly using it, how should i specify my bot in it?
2011-08-09T21:10:13  <janzert> you shouldn't have to edit it at all, just run "test_bot.cmd your/bot/cmd"
2011-08-09T21:10:20  <janzert> well your\bot\cmd
2011-08-09T21:11:41  <blankrider> ah okay got it, "bot 0 crashed"
2011-08-09T21:12:06  <janzert> well that's a little progress at least :/
2011-08-09T21:12:10  <blankrider> yea
2011-08-09T21:12:27  <blankrider> I'm using the default Java bot package, I feel like the starter guide is not very clear on how to compile it for this format
2011-08-09T21:12:46  <blankrider> I have tried compililing a .jar with all classes, just a single class, still crash
2011-08-09T21:12:57  <janzert> unfortunately I'm not really familiar with java :(
2011-08-09T21:13:14  <janzert> one thing though is try and make sure you can run the bot directly yourself
2011-08-09T21:13:35  <janzert> you should be able to run the bot the enter "ready" and have it respond with "go"
2011-08-09T21:13:44  <janzert> IIRC :}
2011-08-09T21:14:12  <janzert> depending on the bot sending "go" may have it respond with "go" as well
2011-08-09T21:14:32  * janzert can never remember what the first turn ending command is
2011-08-09T21:14:59  <blankrider> ah progress
