2011-05-04T07:26:38  <mcstar> and now he can naturally sing loudly, and the higher pitches almost perfectly
2011-05-04T07:26:57  <mcstar> but hes in puberty
2011-05-04T07:27:02  <mcstar> and all this may change

2011-05-04T07:29:46  <mcstar> similar show
2011-05-04T07:29:56  <mcstar> but in hungarian so u wont understand it
2011-05-04T07:30:12  <mcstar> but im curious about what are youre impressions
2011-05-04T07:30:16  <mcstar> ok?
2011-05-04T07:30:30  <antimatroid> i'm probably not a good judge of these things but sure
2011-05-04T07:31:23  <antimatroid> it sort of sounds funny in places when i don't understand the lyrics :P
2011-05-04T07:31:31  <antimatroid> he is talented though
2011-05-04T07:32:04  <antimatroid> now's when you tell me that's you :P
2011-05-04T07:33:30  <antimatroid> he seems like a sad man
2011-05-04T07:33:35  <antimatroid> and wtf is that whistling?
2011-05-04T07:34:25  <mcstar> he was the winner 1 year ago? i dont know i just know about him
2011-05-04T07:34:33  <mcstar> its a nice song really
2011-05-04T07:34:44  <mcstar> im more interested in what u think of hungarian
2011-05-04T07:34:46  <mcstar> the language
2011-05-04T07:35:40  <mcstar> and yes, he is quite sad, and was a very closed person
2011-05-04T07:36:50  <antimatroid> was?
2011-05-04T07:37:01  <mcstar> maybe still is
2011-05-04T07:37:04  <antimatroid> i have no idea about languages sorry
2011-05-04T07:37:06  <mcstar> who knows
2011-05-04T07:37:15  <antimatroid> i am tempted to learn russian
2011-05-04T07:37:19  <antimatroid> just because
2011-05-04T07:37:28  <mcstar> is it very weird, or do u think that it sounds fluent?
2011-05-04T07:37:33  <antimatroid> and lots of maths was done from soviets that was never translated
2011-05-04T07:37:40  <mcstar> hahah
2011-05-04T07:37:46  <mcstar> very good reason
2011-05-04T07:37:55  <mcstar> maybe lets learn german too
2011-05-04T07:37:56  <antimatroid> sounds fluent enough to me
2011-05-04T07:37:59  <mcstar> and chinese
2011-05-04T07:38:56  <mcstar> you know, in the countries which surround hungary, the ppl speak as if someone was pulling their teeth

2011-05-04T07:47:06  <antimatroid> i haven't done anything bar look at food collection
2011-05-04T07:47:09  <antimatroid> i've got heaps of uni work atm
2011-05-04T07:47:24  <mcstar> i see
2011-05-04T07:49:42  <mcstar> hehe
2011-05-04T07:50:06  <mcstar> the girl says jack this is something the pople aroud the world will be watching
2011-05-04T07:50:18  <mcstar> but the vid. got 12000 hits
2011-05-04T07:50:22  <mcstar> lol
2011-05-04T07:51:50  <antimatroid> to be fair, it only just got put up yesterday, has 5000 for me and i only just put it onto /r/australia a few hours ago after a friend posted it on facebook
2011-05-04T07:54:05  <mcstar> oh sry, didnt the timestamp
2011-05-04T07:54:14  <mcstar> see
2011-05-04T07:54:29  <antimatroid> i wish i could see the judges faces right at the start
2011-05-04T08:02:34  <mcstar> oh
2011-05-04T08:02:38  <mcstar> techincal question
2011-05-04T08:02:56  <mcstar> what happens if i try to move my ant outside of the map?
2011-05-04T08:03:02  <antimatroid> outside?
2011-05-04T08:03:05  <antimatroid> there is no outside
2011-05-04T08:03:10  <antimatroid> you're playing on a torus
2011-05-04T08:03:12  <mcstar> yes, there is
2011-05-04T08:03:23  <mcstar> its a matter fo how the engine handles this
2011-05-04T08:03:28  <antimatroid> :P
2011-05-04T08:03:32  <antimatroid> the edges are wrapped
2011-05-04T08:03:39  <antimatroid> the game is on a torus
2011-05-04T08:03:42  <Naktibalda> do you mean invalid move to width +1?
2011-05-04T08:03:49  <mcstar> i know what it means
2011-05-04T08:03:55  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-04T08:04:03  <Naktibalda> err no it's impossible
2011-05-04T08:04:06  <mcstar> is it error, or will that get wrapped?
2011-05-04T08:04:10  <antimatroid> wrapped
2011-05-04T08:04:11  <Naktibalda> you give a direction, not coordinates
2011-05-04T08:04:22  <mcstar> oh yes
2011-05-04T08:04:27  <Naktibalda> or a coordinates of non-existing ant
2011-05-04T08:04:38  <antimatroid> you are going to be surrounded on all sides :P
2011-05-04T08:05:21  <antimatroid> there is a map generator that needs to be written yet if you're keen
2011-05-04T08:05:25  <antimatroid> needs to be done in python though
2011-05-04T08:05:33  <mcstar> huh???
2011-05-04T08:05:38  <mcstar> i saw a couple of them
2011-05-04T08:05:43  <mcstar> java, python
2011-05-04T08:05:51  <mcstar> why so u need another?
2011-05-04T08:05:53  <antimatroid> i expect the current asymmetric python maps to get tossed
2011-05-04T08:05:55  <mcstar> s->d
2011-05-04T08:06:06  <antimatroid> the current symmetric python one i made and we'll be using maps at least like that
2011-05-04T08:06:06  <mcstar> and why is that?
2011-05-04T08:06:13  <antimatroid> but there is another type of symmetry that can be done
2011-05-04T08:06:25  <antimatroid> because they're not "fair" enough and it's impossible to tell how well your bot did
2011-05-04T08:06:56  <mcstar> you mean the current maps are not fair?
2011-05-04T08:07:03  <antimatroid> the symmetric ones are
2011-05-04T08:07:08  <antimatroid> the asymmetric ones are not perfectly fair
2011-05-04T08:07:10  <mcstar> what else is to fairness then symmetry?
2011-05-04T08:07:16  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-04T08:07:28  <antimatroid> although symmetric food spawning isn't on by defailt
2011-05-04T08:07:36  <mcstar> ive got an idea
2011-05-04T08:07:43  <mcstar> u take any non-symmetric map
2011-05-04T08:07:43  <antimatroid> you have to add "--food symmetric" to the play_one_game script to do that
2011-05-04T08:07:53  <mcstar> for example with 2-3 players
2011-05-04T08:08:03  <mcstar> and after the game is over
2011-05-04T08:08:06  <mcstar> you rotate them
2011-05-04T08:08:15  <mcstar> and form some score average
2011-05-04T08:08:19  <antimatroid> too costly
2011-05-04T08:08:40  <antimatroid> there is an idea of using stats of games to judge the "fairness" of a map
2011-05-04T08:08:48  <antimatroid> but i don't see us collecting enough data on enough maps
2011-05-04T08:08:57  *** _0x47 <_0x47!~slash@p3EE09E87.dip.t-dialin.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-04T08:09:10  <mcstar> i think theres too much that can go wrong by "Judging" fairness
2011-05-04T08:09:21  <mcstar> and then correcting scores
2011-05-04T08:09:43  <antimatroid> yes
2011-05-04T08:10:03  <mcstar> how about......
2011-05-04T08:10:04  <antimatroid> imo there's already enough necessary problems with ranking bots
2011-05-04T08:10:08  <mcstar> quasi-crystals?
2011-05-04T08:11:00  <mcstar> huh?
2011-05-04T08:11:01  <mcstar> no?
2011-05-04T08:13:12  <antimatroid> ?
2011-05-04T08:14:30  <mcstar> e aperiodic forms in nature has produced a paradigm shift in the fields of crystallography. Quasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier[1] but until the 80s they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter.
2011-05-04T08:14:32  <mcstar> Roughly, an ordering is non-periodic if it lacks translational symmetry, which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original. The more precise mathematical definition
2011-05-04T08:14:34  <mcstar> shat
2011-05-04T08:14:36  <mcstar> sry
2011-05-04T08:14:40  <mcstar> i didnt want this :)
2011-05-04T08:14:47  <mcstar> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal
2011-05-04T08:14:50  <mcstar> thats it
2011-05-04T08:15:12  <mcstar> non-periodic tiling of the plane
2011-05-04T08:15:34  <mcstar> but its locally symmetric
2011-05-04T08:15:55  <mcstar> u can use as basis-cells some random collection of water-cells
2011-05-04T08:15:58  *** FireFly <FireFly!~firefly@unaffiliated/firefly> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-04T08:16:32  <antimatroid> doesn't really help with symmetry? :P
2011-05-04T08:16:46  <antimatroid> i am very fond of the way i made the current symmetric maps
2011-05-04T08:16:55  <antimatroid> it took me a day or two to work it out
2011-05-04T08:17:10  <antimatroid> my first generator did players in a square lattice
2011-05-04T08:17:11  <mcstar> i saw ur gcd function
2011-05-04T08:17:15  <mcstar> quite nice
2011-05-04T08:17:25  <antimatroid> if i updated it, it's thanks to sigh
2011-05-04T08:17:31  <antimatroid> if i didn't, it can be done better
2011-05-04T08:18:03  <mcstar> why do we need asymmetric maps at all?
2011-05-04T08:18:11  <antimatroid> because j3camero wanted them
2011-05-04T08:18:17  <antimatroid> and j3camero gets what he wants :P
2011-05-04T08:18:25  <mcstar> :D
2011-05-04T08:18:50  <mcstar> ok another idea
2011-05-04T08:18:58  <mcstar> take an asymmetric map
2011-05-04T08:18:59  <antimatroid> i think the current symmetric maps look fine
2011-05-04T08:19:06  <mcstar> compute the local informational entropy
2011-05-04T08:19:11  <antimatroid> doesn't look anywhere near as awful as with the square lattice tilings
2011-05-04T08:19:16  <mcstar> and put the ants where its the same
2011-05-04T08:19:21  <antimatroid> have you seen map_analyzer.py?
2011-05-04T08:19:27  <mcstar> no
2011-05-04T08:19:41  <antimatroid> that will take a map and partition the locations into sets of which ants can reach them first
2011-05-04T08:19:56  <antimatroid> with full equivalence classes for any draws up to any number of ants
2011-05-04T08:20:00  <antimatroid> i wrote that too :P
2011-05-04T08:20:17  <mcstar> heh
2011-05-04T08:20:23  <mcstar> i will check it out
2011-05-04T08:20:47  <antimatroid> that is one thing we can potentially use to judge the fairness of an asymmetric map
2011-05-04T08:21:12  <antimatroid> doing "fair" food spawning on asymmetric maps is a whole other problem too
2011-05-04T08:21:17  <antimatroid> we never came up with a nice solution to that
2011-05-04T08:22:50  <mcstar> on the other hand i think you shouldnt be concerned about fairness
2011-05-04T08:23:08  <mcstar> if a bot playes enough rounds, this will be averaged out
2011-05-04T08:24:17  <antimatroid> i still laugh at mcleopolds reaction to barontrozo entering the room for the first time in months
2011-05-04T08:24:21  <mcstar> just make sure if a bot started from one position on a particular map, then next time it should start from the next position
2011-05-04T08:24:28  <antimatroid> just posts a link to a game of mcleopold winning in planet wars ahahaha
2011-05-04T08:24:47  <antimatroid> it's very hard to see how well your bot does for testing then
2011-05-04T08:24:58  <antimatroid> and i really don't like it, i personally think symmetric maps are way cooler
2011-05-04T08:25:03  <mcstar> who is baron trozo?
2011-05-04T08:25:13  <antimatroid> he did quite well in planet wars
2011-05-04T08:25:28  <antimatroid> part of the infamous rufes band
2011-05-04T08:25:46  <antimatroid> all contest they remained out of irc, but there was a bunch of them doing well, we were like wtf
2011-05-04T08:25:57  <mcstar> sry im not educated enough to know what ur talking about
2011-05-04T08:26:00  <antimatroid> they're a bunch of guys that don't like their workplace, so they go under rufes band
2011-05-04T08:26:24  <mcstar> its like troll?
2011-05-04T08:26:28  <antimatroid> no
2011-05-04T08:26:29  <mcstar> i mean its an idiom?
2011-05-04T08:26:39  <mcstar> or a prticular band?
2011-05-04T08:28:12  <mcstar> i see
2011-05-04T08:28:19  <antimatroid> just a bunch of workmates
2011-05-04T08:28:27  <mcstar> i see the ranking
2011-05-04T08:28:48  <mcstar> from spain
2011-05-04T08:29:45  <mcstar> why do you think the winner won?
2011-05-04T08:29:53  <mcstar> do you know his strategy?
2011-05-04T08:32:07  <antimatroid> he outsmarted everyone
2011-05-04T08:32:13  <antimatroid> he was on top for months
2011-05-04T08:32:19  <antimatroid> his bot is available in the forums
2011-05-04T08:32:28  <mcstar> i have his bot
2011-05-04T08:32:32  <antimatroid> he used a two-ply minimax tree on the first turn and not entirely sure after that
2011-05-04T08:32:52  <antimatroid> he once had the worlds best hex bot i am to understand
2011-05-04T08:32:55  <mcstar> how long did the contest last?
2011-05-04T08:32:59  <antimatroid> 3 months
2011-05-04T08:33:06  <mcstar> hex bot?
2011-05-04T08:33:11  <antimatroid> hex is a game
2011-05-04T08:33:17  <mcstar> i dont know it
2011-05-04T08:33:21  <Naktibalda> not 2?
2011-05-04T08:33:27  <antimatroid> no
2011-05-04T08:33:34  <antimatroid> tron was like 3 weeksish
2011-05-04T08:33:44  <Naktibalda> ok, I quit in a middle :)
2011-05-04T08:33:49  <antimatroid> i think most people agreed planet wars was a little too long
2011-05-04T08:33:57  <antimatroid> so my suggestion has been to go at 2 months in the middle
2011-05-04T08:34:00  <mcstar> one season
2011-05-04T08:34:04  <mcstar> sure it is long
2011-05-04T08:34:23  <antimatroid> we don't want people to be rushed on time though
2011-05-04T08:34:32  <antimatroid> it's a contest about who can come up with the best strategy
2011-05-04T08:34:53  <mcstar> i should really quit tinkering now

2011-05-04T19:47:14  <mcstar> i was worried about the lua config solution
2011-05-04T19:47:20  <mcstar> but its managable
2011-05-04T19:47:33  <mcstar> you may have heard of it, did you?
2011-05-04T19:48:30  <McLeopold> nope
2011-05-04T19:49:52  <mcstar> its a little scripting language which is embeddable, and awesome has this as its configuration interface
2011-05-04T19:50:13  <McLeopold> oh, I've heard of lua, just not awesome
2011-05-04T19:50:23  <mcstar> k
2011-05-04T19:50:44  <mcstar> well, its as good as any of the other tiling wms
2011-05-04T19:50:56  <mcstar> some might say its even better
2011-05-04T19:51:00  <mcstar> i have no problem using it
2011-05-04T19:51:15  <mcstar> just make sure you read the basic shortcuts before u try it
2011-05-04T19:51:47  <mcstar> but when i will understand haskell, i will switch to xmonad probably

2011-05-04T19:53:06  <McLeopold> I just bought learn you a haskell :)
2011-05-04T19:53:22  <mcstar> how many pages?
2011-05-04T19:53:27  <McLeopold> ?
2011-05-04T19:53:32  <McLeopold> about 300
2011-05-04T19:53:44  <mcstar> i only saw the online version
2011-05-04T19:53:47  <mcstar> thats why im asking
2011-05-04T19:54:15  <jbroman> Is the printed version dramatically different from the web version (aside from being on dead trees)?
2011-05-04T19:54:32  <McLeopold> no, I just killed a tree for no reason
2011-05-04T19:54:34  <mcstar> is it more newbie oriented then real world haskell?
2011-05-04T19:54:52  <jbroman> It's a little more gentle, though with less emphasis on applications.
2011-05-04T19:55:04  <jbroman> (assuming it's the same as web)
2011-05-04T19:55:04  <McLeopold> It's more "play with math" oriented than "program projects" oriented
2011-05-04T19:55:29  <McLeopold> should be exactly the same
2011-05-04T19:55:30  <mcstar> fibs = 0:1: zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
2011-05-04T19:55:41  <mcstar> this is my favorite program in haskell for the time being
2011-05-04T19:55:46  <mcstar> (actually its data)
2011-05-04T19:56:28  <McLeopold> that's close to obfuscated c
2011-05-04T19:56:37  <mcstar> really?
2011-05-04T19:56:42  <mcstar> this is clear haskell
2011-05-04T19:56:59  <McLeopold> it's not immediatly obvious what it is doing
2011-05-04T19:57:11  <mcstar> but the syntax is clear
2011-05-04T19:57:13  <McLeopold> to me, who doesn't know haskell yes
2011-05-04T19:57:13  <mcstar> i think
2011-05-04T19:57:26  <McLeopold> it is consice
2011-05-04T19:57:28  <mcstar> i dont know either
2011-05-04T19:57:36  <mcstar> i found this as an exmaple for corecursion
2011-05-04T19:57:54  <mcstar> i looked at it for a minute before i understood
2011-05-04T19:57:58  <jbroman> That's fairly clever. It has the oddity that it returns 0 as part of the Fibonacci sequence.
2011-05-04T19:58:09  <mcstar> it is part of it
2011-05-04T19:58:16  <mcstar> 0 1 1 2 3 5....
2011-05-04T19:58:29  <mcstar> and it doesnt returns
2011-05-04T19:58:33  <mcstar> i hope its clear
2011-05-04T19:58:38  <mcstar> its a sequence
2011-05-04T19:58:40  <mcstar> or array
2011-05-04T19:58:44  <mcstar> you have to :
2011-05-04T19:58:49  <jbroman> Yes, but it's an array beginning with zero.
2011-05-04T19:58:50  <mcstar> take 22 fibs
2011-05-04T19:59:06  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-04T19:59:07  <jbroman> Which is not usually considered part of the Fibonacci sequence (easily fixed, though).
2011-05-04T19:59:23  <mcstar> well as far as i know it is:)
2011-05-04T19:59:30  <jbroman> Ah, never mind.
2011-05-04T19:59:32  <jbroman> I'm an idiot.
2011-05-04T19:59:36  <jbroman> I remembered it as 1,1,2…
2011-05-04T19:59:49  <mcstar> thats correct tooo
2011-05-04T19:59:51  <jbroman> In any case, it's fairly clever.
2011-05-04T19:59:56  <mcstar> but it works from 0 too
2011-05-04T20:00:19  <jbroman> Yeah, I know. I just wasn't used to seeing it presented as beginning with zero.
2011-05-04T20:00:24  <McLeopold> http://oeis.org/A000045
2011-05-04T20:00:27  <mcstar> well, obviously i dont think that when someone writes haskell every line is THAT clever :)

2011-05-04T20:10:32  <mcstar> the gui is nice
2011-05-04T20:10:39  <mcstar> but it was a bit slow

2011-05-04T20:11:04  <jbroman> Which problems are you referring to, if I may ask?
2011-05-04T20:11:25  <mcstar> well, customization for one
2011-05-04T20:11:36  <mcstar> to be productiv u have to download a lot of stuff
2011-05-04T20:11:46  <mcstar> 90% of them are usually cracked
2011-05-04T20:11:53  <jbroman> It's true that OS X (at least the surface layer) is less customizable.
2011-05-04T20:12:02  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-04T20:12:09  <jbroman> But you can install your own Unix utilities and Python installation and such.
2011-05-04T20:12:15  <mcstar> i even managed to change the background of the dock
2011-05-04T20:12:36  <jbroman> Yeah, you have to be content with certain aspects of the GUI (I am).
2011-05-04T20:12:53  <mcstar> then i have to install quicksolver
2011-05-04T20:12:57  <mcstar> silver
2011-05-04T20:13:02  <mcstar> and other utilities
2011-05-04T20:13:16  <mcstar> but all this goodness in linux is a command away
2011-05-04T20:13:18  <jbroman> And you're satisfied with the default installation of {insert distro here}?
2011-05-04T20:13:30  <jbroman> Ah, OK.
2011-05-04T20:13:39  <jbroman> Yes, package managers have their pros.
2011-05-04T20:13:39  <mcstar> i use arch
2011-05-04T20:13:50  <mcstar> by default u have a nice back real termnal
2011-05-04T20:14:07  <jbroman> "nice back real termnal"?
2011-05-04T20:14:30  <mcstar> as in no graphical backend, no x windows
2011-05-04T20:14:51  <mcstar> just a couple of core packages to get yopu started
2011-05-04T20:15:06  <mcstar> and then u install exactly what you want
2011-05-04T20:15:10  <jbroman> It's true. It does mean that much more work to get "productive", as you say, though certainly a package manager helps with that.
2011-05-04T20:15:28  <mcstar> but then i can save this productivity
2011-05-04T20:15:32  <mcstar> all the configs
2011-05-04T20:15:39  <mcstar> i can even dd the whole partition
2011-05-04T20:15:45  <jbroman> Config files are movable on other platforms, too. :P
2011-05-04T20:15:54  <mcstar> dd on another machine and use my system
2011-05-04T20:15:59  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-04T20:16:06  <mcstar> try to find all the windows configs
2011-05-04T20:16:08  <mcstar> or macs
2011-05-04T20:16:14  <jbroman> ~/Library on Mac.
2011-05-04T20:16:20  <mcstar> and theres anotehr one
2011-05-04T20:16:20  <jbroman> Mostly ~/Library/Preferences.
2011-05-04T20:16:23  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-04T20:16:40  <jbroman> I've never had to move a config file that wasn't in ~/Library (except MacVim which uses ~/.vimrc and such).
2011-05-04T20:16:53  <mcstar> oh and ports
2011-05-04T20:17:06  <jbroman> MacPorts is a pain, if that's what you're referring to.
2011-05-04T20:17:09  <mcstar> i dont want to comopile from source all the time
2011-05-04T20:17:14  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-04T20:17:41  <jbroman> That's not even an Apple technology. I use Homebrew (which also compiles), but frankly I don't install/uninstall software all that often.
2011-05-04T20:17:42  <mcstar> maybe i had a bad experience because the powerbook was a little slow
2011-05-04T20:18:05  <mcstar> apple techology?
2011-05-04T20:18:11  <jbroman> Apple didn't invent MacPorts.
2011-05-04T20:18:13  <jbroman> It's a third-party thing.
2011-05-04T20:18:13  <mcstar> i dont care where it comes from
2011-05-04T20:18:19  *** Mathnerd314 <Mathnerd314!~mathnerd3@dsl.6.28.53.206.cos.dyn.pcisys.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-04T20:18:36  <mcstar> but if i want access to opensource gnu tools i have to use it
2011-05-04T20:18:40  <jbroman> I'm more or less saying that you aren't forced to use MacPorts.
2011-05-04T20:18:57  <jbroman> Personally, I'm happy with the build quality of the Macs, and there are aspects of the GUI and Mac applications that I find simply more refined than on Linux (et al). Though I would be using Linux if I didn't have my Mac (and indeed I do for servers and such).
2011-05-04T20:19:07  <jbroman> Really, I'm not trying to convert you or anything – don't worry.
2011-05-04T20:19:19  <mcstar> i already tried it
2011-05-04T20:19:56  <mcstar> even on linux im moving towrds minimalistic tiling wms
2011-05-04T20:20:16  <mcstar> so finally im not obsessed with the gui
2011-05-04T20:20:19  <mcstar> the beauty
2011-05-04T20:20:31  <mcstar> yes, linux was always uglier
2011-05-04T20:20:56  <mcstar> by the time it actually got pretty, i wont see its beaty
2011-05-04T20:20:58  <mcstar> :)
2011-05-04T20:21:38  <mcstar> what i liked in osx were the keyboard shortcuts
2011-05-04T20:22:03  <mcstar> but it seems win7 features some more too
2011-05-04T20:22:15  <jbroman> Haha, the problem isn't effort (look at Compiz), it's the lack of creative direction (really an intrinsic problem with open-source: it's built by engineers, not designers). But that's fine – Linux isn't supposed to be OS X or Windows in my mind.
2011-05-04T20:22:20  <jbroman> They're all capable OSes in their own right.
2011-05-04T20:22:37  <mcstar> yeah
2011-05-04T20:22:56  <mcstar> the problem with windows is that there a malice in the world and stupid users
2011-05-04T20:23:13  <jbroman> Microsoft has another problem and that is legacy support.
2011-05-04T20:23:26  <jbroman> Windows could use a more drastic makeover but they can't break legacy compatibility.
2011-05-04T20:23:29  <mcstar> but its getting virtualized
2011-05-04T20:23:34  <mcstar> so its not a problem anymore
2011-05-04T20:23:35  <jbroman> It's only with Windows 7 x64 that 16-bit support was dropped.
2011-05-04T20:23:40  <jbroman> It's still a problem.
2011-05-04T20:23:50  <jbroman> VMs can help with it, but they don't completely solve it.
2011-05-04T20:24:06  <mcstar> i think win7 has a win xp virtual runtime
2011-05-04T20:24:16  <jbroman> Yes, there is support for this in some editions.
2011-05-04T20:24:25  <jbroman> But it doesn't let Microsoft get away with rewriting the OS.
2011-05-04T20:24:43  <jbroman> It just gives them a Band-Aid solution to those cases that are really tough to support.
2011-05-04T20:25:32  <jbroman> Windows Vista was much-maligned, but what it was was Microsoft's attempt to make some much-needed changes in the least-damaging way possible. Windows 7 was them actually fixing all of the problems those changes created, but a lot of good stuff came in Vista.
2011-05-04T20:25:34  <mcstar> well, my biased opinion is that everyone on the techincal side and not bound to some stupid windows only software should use linux
2011-05-04T20:26:15  <mcstar> or at least give it a try
2011-05-04T20:26:31  <jbroman> I know that a lot of people feel that way, but there are plenty of bright technical Windows and Mac users who use that software not because they can't figure out bash but because they prefer it. The "give it a try" point is fairer, I think.
2011-05-04T20:26:34  <mcstar> its a bit like for example for me learning haskell
2011-05-04T20:27:13  <mcstar> in principle its like any other programming language
2011-05-04T20:27:37  <mcstar> but i think i will have to put more effort in it to get to the level to use it efficiently
2011-05-04T20:27:52  <mcstar> but then i expect more return than from an another language
2011-05-04T20:28:08  <jbroman> Part of it is that it's simply more of a departure from past programming experience for most people.
2011-05-04T20:28:18  <jbroman> Haskell is really nice, though.
2011-05-04T20:28:27  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-04T20:28:33  <mcstar> a:)
2011-05-04T20:28:53  <mcstar> but i just got to know common lisp
2011-05-04T20:29:09  <mcstar> i finished my random bot today
2011-05-04T20:29:43  <mcstar> so i will let some time passs before i will pick up a haskell book
2011-05-04T20:31:19  <mcstar> 340 lines
2011-05-04T20:31:29  <mcstar> but its extensible of course
2011-05-04T20:32:10  <mcstar> im thinking on reading up on swarm behavior and some genetic algorithms
2011-05-04T20:33:22  <mcstar> btw have you searched for existing solutions for the ant problem
2011-05-04T20:33:33  <mcstar> before you started to plan this contest?
2011-05-04T20:33:59  <mcstar> people must have had work on this before
2011-05-04T20:34:11  <mcstar> or at least very similar problems
