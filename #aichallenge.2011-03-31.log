2011-03-31T11:12:46  <Stocha> let's begin with shortterm :)
2011-03-31T11:13:58  <phire> right now I'm implementing A*
2011-03-31T11:14:08  <phire> at about the rate of 1 line of code per hour
2011-03-31T11:15:05  <phire> which will prevent my bot from sending illegal moves
2011-03-31T11:16:38  <Stocha> A* ? can i find it in wikipedia ?
2011-03-31T11:17:05  <phire> yeah
2011-03-31T11:17:19  <phire> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
2011-03-31T11:17:29  <Stocha> thx
2011-03-31T11:19:18  <Stocha> where will you put the nodes ? on every squares ?
2011-03-31T11:19:44  <Stocha> how efficient will all that be with 100 ants ?
2011-03-31T11:20:16  <phire> yeah, make each square a node, with edges connecting it to the 4 adjacent squares
2011-03-31T11:20:31  <Stocha> you'll tell us about the perf then :p
2011-03-31T11:20:35  <phire> This is a good tutorial for understanding it: http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm
2011-03-31T11:20:44  <Stocha> i'm curious to compare that with the naive approach i used.
2011-03-31T11:20:57  <phire> did you do a flood fill?
2011-03-31T11:24:13  <Stocha> yeah
2011-03-31T11:24:14  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2011-03-31T11:24:20  <Stocha> i do more than one actually
2011-03-31T11:24:30  <Stocha> i do plenty of them. like 3 per ant.
2011-03-31T11:24:35  <Stocha> only for food gathering.
2011-03-31T11:24:58  <Stocha> although my food gathering is still lacking it seems. I'll have to work more on that. It's really hard to do efficiently :p
2011-03-31T11:25:28  <Stocha> but the flood fill is quite fast i should say. Well i didn't do any timing or anything yet. But i mean, my bots play fast :p
2011-03-31T11:26:01  <Stocha> I'll do some timing hopefully.
2011-03-31T11:26:16  <Stocha> java is quite fast.
2011-03-31T11:28:24  <phire> flood fill is pretty good over a short distance
2011-03-31T11:29:43  <phire> and I wouldn't be supprised if it keeps up with A*

2011-03-31T11:31:16  <phire> Long term, my plan is to have a lot of independent "modules" that output lists of tasks
2011-03-31T11:31:17  <woudshoo> phire, stocha: I am planning to go with flood fill, at the moment I did it the easy way, generating all ant x food combinations and sort them on distance and walk in the right direction (so my ants get stuck).  But it stayed fast enough for > 500 ants
2011-03-31T11:31:54  <phire> like an economics modules that tasks for each food square
2011-03-31T11:32:24  <phire> then I would have a scheduler that assigns tasks to ants based on distance and priority
2011-03-31T11:32:30  <Stocha> mine is good for reasonable map size.
2011-03-31T11:32:42  <Stocha> I go for closest ant go to closest food first.
2011-03-31T11:33:01  <Stocha> It works good. (you may have seen the animations on the forum :p )
2011-03-31T11:33:09  <Stocha> But not close to good enough i guess.
2011-03-31T11:33:34  <Stocha> And flood fill is not very flexible. it's good for brute forcing some prototype though :p
2011-03-31T11:34:22  <Stocha> resonable map size being like up to 120x120.  I have no idea what real map size will be.
2011-03-31T11:34:49  <phire> yeah, thats why I chose A*, its very flexible
2011-03-31T11:35:44  <phire> you can increase the cost of squares near the wall, so that the ants will avoid the walls when possible

2011-03-31T11:36:43  <woudshoo> phire: I am just curious, but as far as I can tell, A* has the drawback that you need to know from where to where you have to good.  I was more thinking like a tweaked floodfill, starting from all the know food locations at the same time.
2011-03-31T11:37:09  <Stocha> that's what i do :p
2011-03-31T11:37:32  <Stocha> i start from all food, then find the closest ant. And i go until all food have been assigned an ant.
2011-03-31T11:37:44  <Stocha> although it's no state. i do it each turn at the moment.
2011-03-31T11:38:09  <Stocha> Anyway new food tend to appear every turn :p
2011-03-31T11:38:21  <Stocha> or to disapear (when ennmy chop it off)
2011-03-31T11:38:35  <Stocha> i have to goo, i'll see your comment on contestbot log :p

2011-03-31T11:39:08  <phire> woudshoo, if you remove the heuristic, it will act a lot like a flood fill.
2011-03-31T11:40:34  <woudshoo> phire: Yes, but what put me on the wrong food is that without a heuristic I don't think about it as A*
2011-03-31T11:41:34  <woudshoo> The interesting bit with food gathering will be the greedy approach vs a more global optimal approach.  That last bit seems quit hard.
2011-03-31T11:41:36  <phire> no, it degrades into Dijkstra's algorithm

2011-03-31T11:43:27  <phire> I think the key is going to be to divide the game up into stages.
2011-03-31T11:44:03  <phire> in the early stages, I think the gready food gathering algorithm is close to optimum

2011-03-31T11:45:58  <woudshoo> Hm, multiple stages, was not planning on doing that.  My gut feeling tells me that aggresively getting food stays important all the time, but hopefully after a while your density of ants is such that you don't need all ants for food gathering, the remainder should be fighter ants.
2011-03-31T11:46:55  <woudshoo> I think greedy is close to optimal, but I am fearing that in the end the good bots will win or fail in their reproduction rate.
2011-03-31T11:47:28  <woudshoo> Thirdly, the food bonus is a bit odd, if at the end you are winning, you might want to not eat food, because they will be converted into points, ants don't count.
2011-03-31T11:49:49  <phire> the food bonus rule is under debate
2011-03-31T11:50:16  <phire> and I don't really think its going to come into effect in a lot of games
2011-03-31T11:51:03  <phire> the interesting thing is, any ant alive at the end of the game is wasted
2011-03-31T11:52:10  <woudshoo> Hopefully not, also, I found it already quite hard to find a strategy to kill a enemy ant reliably without losing one of your own.
2011-03-31T11:52:55  <phire> which battle resolution are you using in testing?
2011-03-31T11:53:04  <woudshoo> Also with multiple players you can still win even if you lose against each opponent individually
2011-03-31T11:53:46  <woudshoo> The battly resolution with: 1 ant deals 1 point of damage evenly, ant dies if it receive >= 1 point of damage
2011-03-31T11:54:28  <phire> yeah, that one
2011-03-31T11:56:18  <phire> I think the goal will be to aim to loose less ants than the enemy
2011-03-31T11:56:21  <phire> rather than none

2011-03-31T14:23:09  <Stocha> i never tested my newest bot. Because i was confident they would do badly :p
2011-03-31T14:23:48  <Stocha> the one you can see in the link is probably what i would call medium strength
2011-03-31T14:24:04  <phire> are both bots the same ai?
2011-03-31T14:24:16  <Stocha> ìn this yes
2011-03-31T14:24:30  <Stocha> well not 100% the same
2011-03-31T14:24:39  <Stocha> the Fh02_2 is slightly stronger
2011-03-31T14:24:50  <Stocha> but you wouldn't see by mere looking at the game
2011-03-31T14:25:05  <McLeopold> Stocha: is that jnlp?
2011-03-31T14:25:12  <Stocha> o
2011-03-31T14:25:16  <Stocha> applet
2011-03-31T14:26:31  <Stocha> if you want, i'll take the time to post some stuff with the step by step option. But that still gives some feeling of the game
2011-03-31T14:28:07  <phire> looking at that

2011-03-31T14:28:32  <phire> I think the map will effect the optimum strategy a lot.
2011-03-31T14:28:38  <Stocha> looking at games step by step, you soon realize that greedy is simply not good enough at the start of the game in the begining
2011-03-31T14:28:58  <Stocha> Yeah, the map really happens to affect the game and bot strength
2011-03-31T14:29:14  <Stocha> you can get big cut off in dev, if you know the map size and settings.

2011-03-31T14:29:27  <Stocha> some stuff might be totally irrelevant for some maps.
2011-03-31T14:31:20  <phire> I've been doing most of my strategy planning based on the assumption of huge arena style maps

2011-03-31T14:34:20  <phire> with a map like that, you are going to need to focus on the size of the grouping and continuous map coverage
2011-03-31T14:37:32  <Stocha> send me some map gen spec if you wish
2011-03-31T14:37:55  <Stocha> if simple :p
