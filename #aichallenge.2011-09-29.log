2011-09-29T03:29:10  <mleise> For the official start I hope, all the registred users will be informed.
2011-09-29T03:30:09  <mcstar> oh
2011-09-29T03:30:18  <mcstar> so its still not official?

2011-09-29T03:31:56  <mcstar> 191 days ago this is what aerique said:

2011-09-29T03:32:08  <mcstar> "The official start is still a couple of weeks away,"
2011-09-29T03:33:06  <mleise> 191/7 = 27 weeks ...
2011-09-29T03:33:59  <mleise> but *this* time we are really close to the official start, closer than before at least, but that is just a matter of time i guess
2011-09-29T03:34:34  <mcstar> i guess the changes brought about new bugs for mcleo
2011-09-29T03:34:39  <mcstar> to fix
2011-09-29T03:36:23  <mleise> and for the starter bots
2011-09-29T03:37:23  <mcstar> i am more and more surprised by  the score difference that melis had
2011-09-29T03:37:31  <mcstar> pw was a very clean game
2011-09-29T03:38:18  <mcstar> and yet, in ants the top players were very close in score
2011-09-29T03:38:26  <mleise> melis was god-like to us. we thought he had some crazy uber code in the bot. turned out he did what everyone else does, just a little better
2011-09-29T03:39:03  <mcstar> interesting
2011-09-29T03:39:36  <mleise> "heurisitcs" was the buzz-word. "Are you still using heuristics only?"
2011-09-29T03:40:03  <mleise> Heuristics won the game and it took a while until someone wrote a bot that could beat melis
2011-09-29T03:40:06  <mcstar> in ants "heuristics" has much bigger role
2011-09-29T03:41:00  <mleise> You don't have complete knowledge in ants, you had that in PW
2011-09-29T03:41:33  <mcstar> yes, you could predict the future with more certainty in pw
2011-09-29T03:41:42  <mcstar> but you really cant predict in ants globally
2011-09-29T03:42:06  <mcstar> first thing i will do is to identify what is happening on the map
2011-09-29T03:42:22  <mleise> you could start by merging groups of ants into larger blobs
2011-09-29T03:42:26  <mcstar> and with the addition of maze maps, the game becomes significantly harder too
2011-09-29T03:42:44  <mcstar> i think i will ned a waypoint graph
2011-09-29T03:42:46  <mcstar> need*
2011-09-29T03:42:58  <mcstar> at least its logical to have one
2011-09-29T03:43:21  <mleise> There are improvements to A* that divide a map into 'rooms'/'dead ends'
2011-09-29T03:43:46  <mcstar> oh
2011-09-29T03:43:56  <mcstar> whats that called?
2011-09-29T03:43:57  <mleise> I have my own ideas to pathfinding. Maybe I'll just code that for 2 months and nothing else ^^

2011-09-29T03:56:59  <mleise> actually I forgot how they determine what room is to be included in the search.
2011-09-29T03:57:30  <mleise> it may be a waypoint system
2011-09-29T03:57:46  <mcstar> i guess after a couple of searches these areas will be clear, and you need to store them permanently
2011-09-29T03:57:54  <mcstar> as if they were water for example
2011-09-29T04:00:34  <mleise> I'm still not sure how optimized algorithms perform with the ants game, where you have no knowledge of the map and may have to move ants in packs

2011-09-29T04:06:34  <mcstar> when you dont know the destination coordinates, only a criterion for the end tile, its better to use dijkstra

2011-09-29T04:22:31  <K333ES> I have a bit of a problem with 1 sec / move... I feel that with increasingly complex game you need a bit more for intelligent play..
2011-09-29T04:22:56  <patrisk> You know, the viewer on the front page is zoomed in on the center area, but there is no way to zoom out or move it, even using the minimap. Is that supposed to happen?
2011-09-29T04:23:02  <mcstar> in beta it was 0.5 sec
2011-09-29T04:25:39  <K333ES> Personally I'd prefer a chess-like time management. Where an engine has N minutes (or seconds) for M moves.
2011-09-29T04:27:40  <K333ES> Which would introduce a time management concept. Like, thinking much on some moves and little on other moves.
2011-09-29T04:28:25  <K333ES> Which would also mean that a time left on the clock is received by a bot at the beginning of each move. Which would allow to change the time control without rewriting all bots.

2011-09-29T11:14:44  <sir_macelon> I don't know if you have already noticed this, but the maze_4 map is generating almost only draws, because the starting locations are so far away
2011-09-29T11:14:46  <sir_macelon> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/map.php?map=maze/maze_4.map
2011-09-29T11:15:21  <sir_macelon> there should some mechanism to identify draw-prone maps and disqualify them
2011-09-29T11:15:28  <sir_macelon> like it was in planet wars
2011-09-29T11:16:16  <sir_macelon> these draws affect ranks of bots which get to be paired with some low ranked bot
2011-09-29T11:17:14  <eashoka> sir_macelon : very true, when everything else in the competition has been designed to end games quickly.
2011-09-29T11:17:35  <sir_macelon> the other thing is I've noticed odd matchups, like two consecutive games on same map, or two consecutive 1v1 games with the same opponent
2011-09-29T11:18:11  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I've read janzert has been removing some maps already
2011-09-29T11:18:27  <sir_macelon> but they were related to the hills on water problem

2011-09-29T15:57:20  <a1k0n> when did the hills change go in btw?
2011-09-29T15:57:27  <a1k0n> i haven't been keeping up
2011-09-29T15:57:35  <janzert> this past Sunday
2011-09-29T15:57:40  <a1k0n> oh wow
2011-09-29T15:58:00  <mleise> when do we launch?
2011-09-29T15:58:15  <a1k0n> really changes the dynamics of the game.  once the hill is gone you can't spawn any more ants, i take it?
2011-09-29T15:58:25  <mleise> a1k0n: exactly
2011-09-29T15:58:32  <a1k0n> not all the docs have been updated for hills
2011-09-29T15:58:34  <mleise> you can have multiple hills though
2011-09-29T15:58:39  <a1k0n> what?  how?
2011-09-29T15:58:50  <janzert> the map starts you with them
2011-09-29T15:58:53  <mleise> depending on the map, some maps have 4 hills per player
2011-09-29T15:58:54  <a1k0n> oh
2011-09-29T15:59:07  <a1k0n> ok, so you can't gain hills; only lose them
2011-09-29T15:59:09  <mleise> you can not capture enemy hills
2011-09-29T15:59:14  <janzert> right
2011-09-29T15:59:38  <a1k0n> so if you have four hills they round-robin where ants spawn?
2011-09-29T15:59:51  <a1k0n> and there's some kind of spawn queue if you eat multiple food per turn?
2011-09-29T15:59:58  <mleise> yes
2011-09-29T16:00:04  <mleise> and yes
2011-09-29T16:00:04  <janzert> contestbot: bot later tell McLeopold can you look at https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/271 I see the issue showing up on the server but I'm not sure the fix is correct

2011-09-29T16:00:44  <mleise> a1k0n: If you don't move a spawned ant away, you will effectively block that hill and make your ants spawn elsewhere
2011-09-29T16:00:50  <janzert> well, it's not quite round-robin, it's least recently occupied
2011-09-29T16:01:16  <a1k0n> ah, heh.  an interesting way to control that
2011-09-29T16:01:30  <mleise> yeah the internal counter goes up until an ant is on top of the hill
2011-09-29T16:01:57  <mleise> at which point it resets to 0 (lowest spawn priority)

2011-09-29T16:35:32  <mcstar> wait what?
2011-09-29T16:35:45  <mcstar> if the hill is blocked the ant spawns randomly on the map?

2011-09-29T16:36:31  <janzert> a blocked hill is by definition more recently occupied than any unblocked hill ;)
2011-09-29T16:36:58  <mcstar> i mean can ants spawn anywhere else toehr than a hill?
2011-09-29T16:37:04  <janzert> if there is a tie in how recently occupied hills are it is broken randomly
2011-09-29T16:37:09  <janzert> no
2011-09-29T16:37:12  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.100.93> has quit IRC (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2011-09-29T16:37:24  <janzert> if all hills are blocked no ant spawns
2011-09-29T16:38:25  <mcstar> can those ants later spawn that were not spawned because of blocking?
2011-09-29T16:38:35  <mcstar> are they buffered so to speak?
2011-09-29T16:38:40  <janzert> yep
2011-09-29T16:38:56  <janzert> it's called showed as the hive in the visualizer
2011-09-29T16:39:52  <janzert> http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=3563 see towards the end of that game
2011-09-29T16:40:19  <mcstar> so the ant-hill can be used for an ambush, lure in the opponent, release the buffer voila, they never knew what hit them
2011-09-29T16:40:22  <janzert> A.Smith builds up a large queue
2011-09-29T16:40:36  <janzert> :) you could try it anyway
2011-09-29T16:40:41  <mcstar> guess whose bot is that
2011-09-29T16:41:21  <janzert> a star treck fan ;)
2011-09-29T16:41:50  <mcstar> you are correct
2011-09-29T16:41:54  <mcstar> i am
2011-09-29T16:42:09  <mcstar> my prev. bot was called Lore
2011-09-29T16:42:23  <janzert> what is -.-.-- though?
2011-09-29T16:42:31  <mcstar> figure it out
2011-09-29T16:42:34  <mcstar> its easy
2011-09-29T16:42:44  <a1k0n> is that supposed to be the enterprise?

2011-09-29T16:44:30  <a1k0n> since -.- is k
2011-09-29T16:44:37  <janzert> right, it's actually supposed to be ascii art
2011-09-29T16:44:52  <janzert> mcstar: right?
2011-09-29T16:44:59  <mcstar> nah
2011-09-29T16:45:05  <mcstar> a1k0n was spot on
2011-09-29T16:45:13  <mcstar> now pls decode
2011-09-29T16:45:22  <janzert> the message?
2011-09-29T16:45:25  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-29T16:45:32  <mcstar> you really want me to tell you?
2011-09-29T16:45:35  <janzert> live long and prosper, of course
2011-09-29T16:45:40  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-09-29T16:45:42  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-29T16:45:50  <janzert> how did you think I knew it was star trek fan? :)
2011-09-29T16:46:09  <a1k0n> whoa, what?
2011-09-29T16:46:26  <mcstar> well, i though it was a coutner-joke to matrix
2011-09-29T16:46:38  <a1k0n> i also don't get the a.smith reference
2011-09-29T16:46:45  <a1k0n> oh
2011-09-29T16:46:48  <janzert> at least morse code doesn't mean trekky to me ;)
2011-09-29T16:46:48  <a1k0n> right
2011-09-29T16:46:49  <mcstar> you say star trek, but the nick is obviously related to the matrix
2011-09-29T16:48:23  <janzert> heh, I'm old fashioned I suppose. morse code makes me think the person is probably a ham operator
2011-09-29T16:49:22  <mcstar> i have to re-watch the first movie, the one with V'ger
2011-09-29T16:49:30  <mcstar> didnt they use morese-code in it?
2011-09-29T16:49:35  <mcstar> morse*
2011-09-29T16:49:56  <janzert> actually I've only ever watched the most recent movie, and maybe a dozen episodes
2011-09-29T16:49:58  <mcstar> im not sure, anyway, i dont know klingon
2011-09-29T16:50:36  <mcstar> and aside from star trek, live long and prosper has a nice ring to it, i liek it
2011-09-29T16:50:59  <janzert> :)
2011-09-29T16:51:09  <mcstar> i really hope that i can write a bot that lives up to its name
2011-09-29T16:51:24  <mcstar> i might have bitten more than i can chew...
2011-09-29T16:52:12  <janzert> well you can decide at contest launch whether you want to try or switch to a less demanding name :P
2011-09-29T16:52:39  <mcstar> oh, i forget that its still half-live
2011-09-29T16:52:49  <mcstar> yeah, i think ill stick with it
2011-09-29T16:52:55  <mcstar> it will give me motivation
2011-09-29T16:52:57  <mcstar> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=3575&user=39
2011-09-29T16:53:03  <mcstar> can you take a look at this game?
2011-09-29T16:53:13  <mcstar> sort of interesting the final scoring
2011-09-29T16:53:54  <janzert> what about it? no one captured a hill throughout
2011-09-29T16:54:17  <mcstar> ok
2011-09-29T16:54:27  <mcstar> seems im not familiar with the changed rules
2011-09-29T16:54:50  <janzert> points are only given for destroying a hill
2011-09-29T16:55:05  <janzert> and you lose a point for losing one of your own
2011-09-29T16:56:08  <mcstar> 2 per hill are given
2011-09-29T16:56:40  <janzert> instead of losing a point when you lose a hill I'd rather say it as you get a point each hill you keep control of until the end of the game, but McLeopold doesn't like it that way and it works out to the same thing ;)
2011-09-29T16:56:56  <janzert> yes, 2 points for each hill you destroy
2011-09-29T16:59:36  <mcstar> janzert: have you considered re-opening an ant-orifice after another hive's ant stuck dirt in it?
2011-09-29T16:59:44  <mcstar> (by the same ant it belonged to)
2011-09-29T17:00:04  <mcstar> i mean the possibility of this
2011-09-29T17:00:48  <amstan> alias somethingVeryComplicatedSounding="./essay --topic somethingVerySimpleAndDumb -vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv"
2011-09-29T17:01:18  <janzert> considered it as in rejected it yes ;)
2011-09-29T17:02:18  <janzert> I think a hill capture being non-reversible is a fairly important aspect
2011-09-29T17:03:18  <mcstar> i guess you want short games
2011-09-29T17:07:34  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=3560 that ends on "ants not razing hills" I think the population calculation needs to include ants in hives for players with active hills, since the hill can't be captured until it is emptied
2011-09-29T17:07:34  <contestbot> janzert: Ready to serve.
2011-09-29T17:08:02  <mcstar> yeah, ive seen one like that
2011-09-29T17:08:07  <mcstar> now i realize it
2011-09-29T17:08:16  <mcstar> why the opponent ant couldnt step on the hill
2011-09-29T17:09:07  <janzert> if there are ants in the spawn queue, an enemy ant will always die before it can raze the hill
2011-09-29T17:09:23  <janzert> either because of having battle with the spawning ant or just plain colliding with it
2011-09-29T17:10:08  *** amstan <amstan!~alex@69-165-146-115.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2011-09-29T17:10:20  <mcstar> so this means, you can effectively save your hill from being destroyed
2011-09-29T17:10:40  <janzert> if you can keep ants spawning on it continually yes
2011-09-29T17:11:35  <mcstar> this is all very interesting but i still dont have a clue regarding implementation
2011-09-29T17:11:55  <mcstar> i was thinking about my rewrite for ~2 hours now, and ive got nothing
2011-09-29T17:12:12  <janzert> :}
2011-09-29T17:12:13  <mcstar> besides taking drugs, what can i do to have ideas?
2011-09-29T17:12:40  <janzert> go for a walk? ;)
2011-09-29T17:12:48  <mcstar> i just came back
2011-09-29T17:13:18  <janzert> then it's time for the "take a shower" approach :P
2011-09-29T17:13:40  <mcstar> somtimes that works too
2011-09-29T17:14:14  <mcstar> my GR professor told us to take a shower when youre thinking of the hardest problems
2011-09-29T17:15:48  <janzert> yeah, it really can be a great way to cogitate on something
2011-09-29T17:16:19  <a1k0n> OTOH, i've found irc precludes cogitation. :)
2011-09-29T17:17:11  <mcstar> you mean its disturbing to wait for answers, and to look for activity?
2011-09-29T17:17:23  <mcstar> that can be distracting for me
2011-09-29T17:17:26  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-09-29T17:17:42  <mcstar> but look, ive learned a new word today
2011-09-29T17:17:49  <mcstar> to cogitate
2011-09-29T17:17:57  <a1k0n> there is that.
2011-09-29T17:18:07  <a1k0n> i still don't get your live long and prosper thing.
2011-09-29T17:18:29  <mcstar> theres nothing to "get" about it
2011-09-29T17:18:36  <mcstar> or maybe i misunderstand you
2011-09-29T17:18:42  <mcstar> its like saying good luck
2011-09-29T17:18:48  <a1k0n> no i mean
2011-09-29T17:18:51  <a1k0n> -.-.-- means that?
2011-09-29T17:18:56  <a1k0n> i missed the context under which that occurred
2011-09-29T17:19:01  <mcstar> the whole morse sequence
2011-09-29T17:19:02  <a1k0n> so i'm just perplexed
