2012-06-16T03:51:55  <mcstar> UncleVasya: do you go to matches?
2012-06-16T03:52:44  <UncleVasya> I don't care about football. And about other sport things too. Sad :(
2012-06-16T03:53:25  <UncleVasya> I know we lost yesterday. :)
2012-06-16T03:53:37  <mcstar> i dont either, except world cup or european cup
2012-06-16T03:53:47  <mcstar> i like those
2012-06-16T03:54:06  <mcstar> its not an everyday event that ukraine gets to organize it though
2012-06-16T03:54:16  <UncleVasya> Last time I watched foodball game was 4-6 years ago (via TV)
2012-06-16T03:54:40  <mcstar> do you like playing it at least?
2012-06-16T03:54:48  <mcstar> (probably not)
2012-06-16T03:55:03  <UncleVasya> I liked.
2012-06-16T03:55:30  <mcstar> im pretty awkward at it
2012-06-16T03:55:38  <UncleVasya> Probably I like it now too but... ok, it's a story and I'm going to tell it:
2012-06-16T03:55:50  <mcstar> haha
2012-06-16T03:56:28  <UncleVasya> When I was in chool, I liked to play football on physical culture lessons with my classmates and after lessons with guys from my yard.
2012-06-16T03:57:37  <mcstar> physical culture lessons => physical education class, usually abbreviated as simply PE
2012-06-16T03:57:40  <UncleVasya> Not a real foodball in a big green field (it requires to run much) but on the small field (5-6 players in team).
2012-06-16T03:58:16  <mcstar> yeah, sounds familiar so far
2012-06-16T03:58:17  <UncleVasya> When I came to study place I sit at home all the time so I don't have a guys to play with.
2012-06-16T03:59:13  <mcstar> we had compulsory PE classes for 4 semesters here
2012-06-16T03:59:21  <mcstar> i did footbal and table tennis
2012-06-16T03:59:24  <mcstar> l
2012-06-16T04:00:13  <mcstar> and for a time i played indoor football with my high-school buddies
2012-06-16T04:00:27  <mcstar> (after high school has ended)
2012-06-16T04:00:49  <mcstar> i think, but it is getting fuzzy now, im not sure when was that

2012-06-16T04:46:05  <UncleVasya> sorry,  I don't know.
2012-06-16T04:47:11  <UncleVasya> It was a c++'s stack increasing that I posted long time ago, not OCaml.'s
2012-06-16T04:51:24  <mcstar> you did?
2012-06-16T04:58:46  <mcstar> nice
