[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:19:54] <jeff_cameron>	Sure. But I prolly don't need the extra data, if it's all the same to you. I've already got some 600 responses.

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:22:57] <pgpaskar>	extreme is 1mbps, express is 512
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:23:00] <pgpaskar>	and lite is like 256
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:23:05] <jeff_cameron>	What are you uploading?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:23:33] <pgpaskar>	Asset creation for a couple of games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:23:40] <jeff_cameron>	I tell you, back in the day, we would have killed for 256 up. I remember watching songs just *crawling* on Napster.

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:26:39] <greghaynes>	Hello
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:26:54] <pgpaskar>	You know what I find hilarious, on the rogers site they advertise the speed as 'Full length movie - 700mb [1m 55s]'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:27:02] <pgpaskar>	That's the size of an Xvid release.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:27:05] <jeff_cameron>	I'm going to tally the poll results for the games, and blog it. Should only take a minute. I'll post here when done.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:27:14] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: great
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:27:37] <pgpaskar>	Most legal sites use h.264 and its not capped at 700mb or even around there. They don't optimize it to fit on a CD at all

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:30:17] <jeff_cameron>	Oh nice. Also from Oregon?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:30:26] <amstan>	probably not
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:31:24] <amstan>	i hope everyone from #googleai didn't forget about this and they'll come here
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:31:27] <amstan>	i pinged all of them
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:31:33] <amstan>	highlighted*
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:31:41] <greghaynes>	Is another challenge in the works?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:32:04] <darkf>	is the last one over yet?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:32:14] <greghaynes>	A lot of people from my school would be up for more
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:33:35] <amstan>	darkf: yes.... ...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:33:41] <amstan>	greghaynes: yep

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:33:55] <darkf>	what country?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:34:11] <amstan>	darkf: just visit the site, gees: http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:34:36] <darkf>	\o/ go USA!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:35:12] <amstan>	darkf: go 79 different countries!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:36:54] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah. By geolocation, we had registered users from 79 different countries. I literally can't name 79 countries.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:37:12] <jeff_cameron>	I hope we can replicate that kind of success.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:37:28] <greghaynes>	hah, awesome
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:40:43] <jeff_cameron>	We need lots of hackers though ;-)  ;-)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:41:30] <jeff_cameron>	In order to handle another magnitude increase in load, we have to start dealing with real scalability. Replication, load balancing, and all that. Anybody interested?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:42:28] <amstan>	never done any of that stuff before, but sure
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:42:37] <greghaynes>	I could definitely help out some
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:42:40] <amstan>	i also started learning some python, so i could be of use there
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:42:51] <greghaynes>	What type of system are you working with?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:43:07] <pgpaskar>	are we still intending on using corn-syrup or have we exhausted this resource lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:43:20] <amstan>	pgpaskar: depends on csc
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:43:56] <pgpaskar>	man I need to get some new speakers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:45:52] <jeff_cameron>	I want to try to move off the CSC systems as much as possible. This is because those systems won't scale to accommodate our dream scenario.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:46:24] <jeff_cameron>	Also, in order to scale, we need to be able to raise at least a bit of revenue. That doesn't work so well if we're a UW club.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:46:29] <pgpaskar>	Yup
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:46:38] <pgpaskar>	Google ads!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:46:39] <pgpaskar>	lol.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:46:49] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: maybe we can get some funding from someone
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:02] <jeff_cameron>	haha. That's one idea, for sure. There are a couple models that I'm looking at for raising revenue. Ads is one.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:13] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: good idea.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:24] <jeff_cameron>	Perhaps MEF grants or somesuch?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:34] <greghaynes>	Is load balancing between other universities infeasible?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:35] <amstan>	well.. idk if mef would like it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:53] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: i was thinking some big company, like facebook, or nvidia
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:55] <greghaynes>	We have a significant amount of bandwidth we could make use of.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:47:58] <jeff_cameron>	There is also corporate sponsorship, like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc giving us some dough in order to make it the Facebook AI Challenge or the Amazon AI Challenge or what not.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:48:17] <amstan>	we show them what we did so far, and they can give us a few 1000s so we host the servers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:48:30] <jeff_cameron>	greghaynes: load balancing between universities is a great idea.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:48:33] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: yep, that's what i meant
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:49:07] <pgpaskar>	We lack sheer processing power, right? Not so much the bandwidth?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:49:13] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: I like corporate sponsorships, because we would be able to guarantee we have the dough that we need. Ideally, we'd be able to raise a few K.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:49:15] <amstan>	pgpaskar: both
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:49:42] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: not to mention that we could even get prizes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:50:05] <jeff_cameron>	pgpaskar: I am not 100% sure where the bottleneck is actually. It's entirely possible that with the CSC we would have enough CPU and bandwidth. I need to try to figure that out.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:51:16] <jeff_cameron>	I will write a Wiki page about the different revenue models I am picturing tonight.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:51:25] <pgpaskar>	I was just wondering, if we cpu problems, perhaps try a folding@home-esque solution?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:51:45] <pgpaskar>	Throw together a vm image to play games, put this on some idle computers, let distributive computing save the day
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:51:59] <jeff_cameron>	pgpaskar: good idea. We could basically start some sort of a Condor pool comprised of ordinary people's machines.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:52:07] <amstan>	pgpaskar: that would not work so well in securing it, how can we make sure that no user changes the results of a match?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:52:33] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: I don't know. How does folding@home protect against false results?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:52:42] <amstan>	i'm not sure
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:52:49] <greghaynes>	Multiple machines compute the same data, compare
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:52:51] <jeff_cameron>	Ideally, we could have a bit of a trusted network.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:52:58] <pgpaskar>	what greghaynes said
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:04] <pgpaskar>	That's what I'm picturing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:13] <amstan>	greghaynes: but then you need to process the same data more than 3 times
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:18] <greghaynes>	Yep
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:22] <pgpaskar>	But amstan if you have 100x the computing pwoer
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:29] <pgpaskar>	doing 3x the work is minimal overhead
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:43] <pgpaskar>	That's the whole idea behind folding@home
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:53:43] <amstan>	greghaynes: also, what happens when luck is involved in those results? and you can't reproduce matches, RPS is one example
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:16] <jeff_cameron>	I think CPU-wise we would be okay on the CSC's systems for now, even if load grew quite a bit. We were CPU-bound during the last contest, but only because our pairing algorithm was shit. We should have been playing more games between bots of similar strength and using bayeselo for rankings from the start.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:27] <greghaynes>	Yea, make sure its deterministic
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:28] <pgpaskar>	Alternatively, amstan, we could limit it to contest organizers machines
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:29] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:35] <amstan>	pgpaskar: yes, that could work
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:42] <pgpaskar>	I have a few quadcores sitting around doing nothing but serving eachother files
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:51] <amstan>	same
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:57] <pgpaskar>	such a waste of precious q6600s
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:54:59] <pgpaskar>	why did i buy so many of these
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:55:02] <jeff_cameron>	Reeeeally?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:55:21] <pgpaskar>	Well they're for my dad's business, my sister's computer, my desktop and my mom's computer
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:55:33] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: my desktop is quadcore, and my server's running 24/7, dual xeon
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:55:45] <pgpaskar>	But they basically sit idle
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:55:45] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:55:52] <jeff_cameron>	We could save a lot of money by strapping together a robust network of commodity machines, instead of getting dedicated servers in a data centre.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:03] <greghaynes>	Beowulf cluster? ;)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:06] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: we still need to host the websites
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:12] <pgpaskar>	That can be done on csc, amstan
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:18] <pgpaskar>	nobody has the bandwidth to host a website @ home
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:19] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:22] <amstan>	greghaynes: not beowulf, since there doesn't need to be real time coordonation
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:22] <pgpaskar>	been there done that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:24] <pgpaskar>	rogers yelled at me!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:34] <greghaynes>	There doesnt?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:47] <pgpaskar>	naw greghaynes, massive queue, servers fetch from it, compute, post results
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:56:56] <greghaynes>	Allright
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:57:01] <pgpaskar>	aggrigate server builds the results, webserver pushes friendly numbers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:57:09] <pgpaskar>	its a neat model actually
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:57:11] <amstan>	greghaynes: no, just send a bunch of submissions to a client and make them play matches, and next time the client connects to the internet it can send the results to the main server
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:57:27] <greghaynes>	Sounds very doable distributed, then
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:57:31] <amstan>	yep
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:57:39] <amstan>	a little complicated, but it's very flexible
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:58:00] <jeff_cameron>	That would work really well, especially if you send a batch of bots of similar skill to one compute node at a time.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:58:19] <greghaynes>	I can ask which servers we have available for this type of thing at my school.  We have a couple solaris servers that run about a hundred concurrent threads that might be usable.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:58:29] <pgpaskar>	if someone could get a vm image to work as a single instance and have it identify to the main server by some unique name
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:58:34] <pgpaskar>	then you could distribute matches however you wish
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:58:41] Join	jhchrist has joined this channel (~jhchrist@69-165-131-73.dsl.teksavvy.com).
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:58:54] <amstan>	jhchrist: yo
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:00] <jhchrist>	hey
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:20] <jeff_cameron>	What up, jesus
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:28] <jhchrist>	not much, saw the email
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:29] <pgpaskar>	wow its 1am
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:44] <jeff_cameron>	We're just discussing distributed tournaments.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:47] <jhchrist>	have you picked a name for the contest yet?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [00:59:49] <amstan>	jhchrist: we were just talking about how we can distribute the matches folding@home style
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:00:03] <jhchrist>	something condor-esque?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:00:13] <jeff_cameron>	Exactly.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:00:19] <jeff_cameron>	Condor would be perfect for this.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:00:26] <jeff_cameron>	jhchrist: I haven't picked a name yet.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:00:44] <jhchrist>	you should call it "fightr" -- its obnoxiously web 2.0
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:00:50] <jeff_cameron>	"AI Contest" is kinda lame. But we have the domain name ai-contest.com, and it seems a shame to waste that sort of thing.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:02] 	 * amstan supports fightr
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:02] <jeff_cameron>	I like it. fightr.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:22] <jeff_cameron>	What other words end in "er", that we can just omit the "e"?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:44] <jhchrist>	competitr
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:48] <jhchrist>	thats kind of long, though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:49] <greghaynes>	distributr
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:01:54] <greghaynes>	For the system ;)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:03:02] <amstan>	i'm really digging this names idea
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:03:22] <jhchrist>	our forums can have moderatrs
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:03:26] <jhchrist>	:P
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:05:31] <amstan>	jhchrist: umm.. yes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:05:40] <amstan>	why are you bringing it up?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:05:53] <jhchrist>	again with the dropping of the vowels
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:06:00] <amstan>	oh.. lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:06:04] <amstan>	i didn't notice that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:06:10] <jhchrist>	i noticed
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:06:30] <amstan>	sometimes the human brain saves time and doesn't read the whole word
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:07:59] <pgpaskar>	thats called laziness
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:09:29] <jeff_cameron>	Poll results: http://jpcameron.com/blog/
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:09:49] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: ok.. now what?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:09:58] <amstan>	all we found from that is that chess is disliked
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:10:49] <jeff_cameron>	Pretty much.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:10:52] <greghaynes>	Go looks like the winner
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:10:59] <jhchrist>	well, if the rest of them are just about equal, maybe picking one for practical implementation reasons is the way to go
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:11:21] <greghaynes>	I think dots and boxes is most practical
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:11:26] <jeff_cameron>	jhchrist: I agree. All this means is that we need to make the choice based on some other factors.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:11:34] <amstan>	i think dots and boxes would be trivial
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:11:42] <amstan>	it's pretty much chess
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:11:50] <jhchrist>	amstan: what?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:07] <amstan>	like.. you can solve it with minimax
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:17] <jeff_cameron>	One worrying interpretation of the data is that all of these games just generally suck. If they were all kind of "meh", we would expect to get pretty much uniform distribution.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:26] <greghaynes>	battleship
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:38] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:47] <pgpaskar>	battleship would be hilarious
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:51] <greghaynes>	Yep
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:12:56] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: dots and boxes is not trivial. It's very deep. It's only solved for 5x3 I think. Bigger than that is totally intractable.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:13:13] <amstan>	we need something that's interactiveish, like how tron had all the animated games and stuff
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:13:19] <jhchrist>	perhaps we *should* look to cultivate cultural appeal again as we did with tron
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:13:29] <jeff_cameron>	That's what I'm thinking.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:13:47] <jeff_cameron>	So does that mean we pretty much throw out all of those six games, and come up with something else?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:14:15] <jeff_cameron>	I learned from Reddit comments that the power users don't like turn-based board games. They're boring.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:14:22] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: well.. some of those would be nice, but i think we should get something more flashy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:14:36] <jeff_cameron>	That seems to be the general feedback, yeah.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:14:37] <amstan>	so yeah, no turn-based board games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:14:49] <greghaynes>	I wouldnt say that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:15:48] <jhchrist>	what about the prisoners dilemma?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:16:02] <jeff_cameron>	Iterated prisoners' dilemma you mean?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:16:05] <greghaynes>	hah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:16:11] <jeff_cameron>	Like, the iterative version?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:16:27] <jhchrist>	it would have to be
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:16:30] <jeff_cameron>	True.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:16:37] <jeff_cameron>	It's a deep problem.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:17:00] <jeff_cameron>	I saw a paper on it from some guy who ran an IPD competition back in the 90s I think.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:17:32] <greghaynes>	Poker?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:17:40] <jeff_cameron>	The best strategy then seemed to be the tit-for-tat strategy, which would be cooperative unless betrayed. After being betrayed, it would become uncooperative, but then quickly forgive.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:17:53] <jeff_cameron>	Poker was highly requested in the poll I just ran.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:02] <jhchrist>	ooh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:07] <jhchrist>	texas hold'em?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:10] <jeff_cameron>	Poker is a great game.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:17] <jeff_cameron>	No doubt about it.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:19] <greghaynes>	Yep
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:21] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: include some interbot communications
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:26] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:28] <jhchrist>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:32] <pgpaskar>	absolutely no
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:33] <jeff_cameron>	Are there a handful of really simple strategies that would make decent starter packages?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:42] <pgpaskar>	interbot communication lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:52] <jhchrist>	I think we call that 'taunting'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:52] <pgpaskar>	everyone will be counter predicting eachother's 'chat'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:18:58] <pgpaskar>	and then ignoring it all together
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:19:03] <pgpaskar>	once they realize that its as good as gibberish
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:19:04] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:19:10] <greghaynes>	I would think so - keep highest cards
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:19:41] <pgpaskar>	omg and for the visualizer im going to write one of those neat things you see on tv poker
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:19:42] <jeff_cameron>	So I did some analysis on the interbot communication aspect a while back. It turns out that adding comm to almost any game basically just turns it into Survivor.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:19:45] <pgpaskar>	the percentages on the sides
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:20:24] <jeff_cameron>	...which brings us to the ultimate conclusion. Why not just run a Survivor competition?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:20:40] <jeff_cameron>	10 seconds between rounds. At each round, one bot is voted off.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:20:47] <jeff_cameron>	The bots can talk between rounds.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:20:51] <jeff_cameron>	Eh? Eh? :-)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:20:52] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: with a special english like language that bots have to talk in
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:20:55] <greghaynes>	haha
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:04] <jeff_cameron>	We'll call it "COBOL"
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:08] <pgpaskar>	oh my GOD
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:13] <amstan>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:16] <pgpaskar>	if we run a survivor competition sorry i just have to say this but
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:18] <pgpaskar>	that Accoun guy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:22] <amstan>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:23] <pgpaskar>	is gonna have a carnival with us
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:30] <amstan>	lmao
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:21:37] <jeff_cameron>	Oh shit. How has he not been invited to this channel yet?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:22:00] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: no, he left #googleai too
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:22:06] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: also.. don't jinx it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:22:24] <jeff_cameron>	I would seriously consider putting a line in that basically does if (username == "Accoun") {lose_game();}, just for shits and giggles. Especially since the whole thing will be open source.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:22:49] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: you should release the source code for the old contest, and include that line in
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:22:56] <jeff_cameron>	ahaha
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:22:59] <jeff_cameron>	Oh man.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:23:03] <jeff_cameron>	That would be fun times.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:23:40] <jeff_cameron>	Dude you heard the guy. He's going to go to Iraq, build a nuclear weapon, and bomb your house. Usernam ain't nothin to fuck wit.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:23:51] <jeff_cameron>	:-)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:24:00] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: how about survivor + a few extra challenges that the bots should be able to do
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:24:13] <amstan>	kinda like a tv show
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:24:52] <jeff_cameron>	I think Survivor is the deepest possible problem. We should totally do it at some point. The biggest problem is that I can't think of absolutely any trivial strategies. There is a huge barrier to entry. We would get like 12 entries.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:25:16] <jhchrist>	I agree -- this is perhaps a little too involved
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:25:56] <jhchrist>	if the contests become long running ordeals, we could have a survivor competition which runs every n months, say, but you would need lots of time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:27:18] <jeff_cameron>	I doubt it is suitable for this upcoming contest.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:27:28] <pgpaskar>	That would be suitable after maybe the fourth
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:27:36] <jeff_cameron>	Back to Poker. I think it might be able to work. It certainly has the sexiness factor. It's seriously Redditable.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:27:42] <pgpaskar>	Perhaps running a metacompetition inbetween the regular ones
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:27:56] <pgpaskar>	Encourage people to update their previous submissions and have a topcoder like thing going
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:28:03] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:28:07] <amstan>	yes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:28:09] <pgpaskar>	Social AI coding! I can see it now!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:28:16] Part	darkf has left this channel ("Leaving").
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:30:44] <pgpaskar>	I still think a simple RTS game would be kind of neat, fixed units or equal production of units, no resources.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:30:51] <pgpaskar>	but that'd turn into formation AI contest
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:30:57] <pgpaskar>	how to not die faster
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:31:20] <pgpaskar>	err, how to die slower.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:31:20] <greghaynes>	Theres a very large entry barrier to rts
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:31:47] <pgpaskar>	Its difficult to think of these
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:31:53] <amstan>	poker has the same problem
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:31:59] <amstan>	i don't even know how to play poker
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:32:10] <jhchrist>	amstan: rules aren't actually that complicated
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:32:10] <greghaynes>	I dont think so, poker has some simple strategies
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:32:44] <greghaynes>	Keep all similar cards (number or suit); keep highest
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:32:45] <jhchrist>	there is an ordered set of winning hands, get the best one you can
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:33:07] <greghaynes>	Where it gets interesting it with betting ammounts
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:33:32] <pgpaskar>	starter bot: All-in bot
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:33:33] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:33:37] <jeff_cameron>	I think Poker is pretty doable. There are some simple strategies for sure.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:33:41] <jhchrist>	indeed -- the allure of poker is largely the betting and the mind games that go with it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:34:24] <jeff_cameron>	Like, fold everything except 99, 10-10, JJ, QQ, KK, AA.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:34:37] <pgpaskar>	Flush-bot
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:14] <pgpaskar>	Call the challenge pok?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:18] <jeff_cameron>	Or how about a bot that always Checks. If he cannot Check, Fold. That is a totally valid strategy.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:22] <greghaynes>	pokr?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:27] <pgpaskar>	That's a backwards R in case mirc fails
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:29] <pgpaskar>	Which it does
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:32] <pgpaskar>	Oh well, I tried.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:35:59] <pgpaskar>	pokя
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:36:00] <pgpaskar>	did that work
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:36:07] <jhchrist>	crazy russians
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:36:11] <jhchrist>	:P
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:36:13] <jeff_cameron>	If odds > 50%, check or bet. Otherwise fold. That is a slight improvement.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:36:38] <pgpaskar>	Theme the website like PartyPoker.net
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:36:45] <jeff_cameron>	And then you get into calculating pot odds and such. None of it is very complicated.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:37:08] <jhchrist>	PartyPoker.net -- Proud sponsors of the 2010 Pokr AI Tournament
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:37:19] <jhchrist>	ohhh yeah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:37:21] <greghaynes>	People will want to save state per game (not round)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:37:32] <jeff_cameron>	partypokr.tv is totally available.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:00] <pgpaskar>	Oh wow actually that would be HILARIOUS if a real poker site sponsored this
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:03] <pgpaskar>	like Pokerstars
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:03] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:11] <jeff_cameron>	For sure.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:18] <amstan>	pgpaskar: it will probably mean bankrupcy for them
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:24] <jeff_cameron>	In a way, we could make this happen trivially...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:38:37] <pgpaskar>	Nah, pokerstars has a license to print money
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:39:04] <jeff_cameron>	Take top 5 bots from contest, run them on PokerStars. You might say that PokerStars is sposoring the contest.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:39:20] <pgpaskar>	Oh wow
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:39:31] <pgpaskar>	Come to think of it they probably wouldn't want to sponsor it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:39:32] <pgpaskar>	haha
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:39:44] <greghaynes>	Yep, probably not
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:40:32] <pgpaskar>	actually poker is an interesting challenge
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:40:48] <pgpaskar>	Because to win you have to play a bit volatile, take risks
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:40:54] <pgpaskar>	That could totally backfire lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:46:29] <jeff_cameron>	I think it's a decent idea. Let's think about it for a little bit. The biggest potential concern that I have with Poker is that it is not Easy enough. What does everyone think?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:46:57] <jeff_cameron>	If people aren't scared off by the difficulty of the problem, then it's totally an awesome problem.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:47:53] <jhchrist>	I think so long as we can produce sample AIs which are not too complicated but actually have some sanity to them it would go a long way to demonstrating that its not too hard
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [01:47:54] <greghaynes>	With some nice pictures, I dont think itll be too hard. Just list types of hands in order and say top one at the table takes all the money

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:32:01] <jmcarthur>	and that's it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:32:32] <amstan>	hmm

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:35:55] <amstan>	i played with some game of life stuff recently, i tought that was very interesting, it would be a nice interactive thing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:36:11] <amstan>	the only problem is high entry barrier
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:36:36] <jmcarthur>	conway's game of life?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:36:40] <amstan>	yes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:36:51] <amstan>	jmcarthur: if you're in ubuntu, look up golly

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:37:20] <jmcarthur>	i'm on arch, but it's on AUR so i can get it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:37:45] <amstan>	ok
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:38:55] <jmcarthur>	is golly just game of life in the raw, no player vs player concepts?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:39:24] <amstan>	i'm not sure, i just think it's a nice thing to expand upon
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:39:42] <jmcarthur>	i have played variants of it for player vs player games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:40:06] <amstan>	but i was amazed to see how many things you can do with it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:40:08] <amstan>	ex: http://golly.sourceforge.net/ticker.gif
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:40:13] <amstan>	that's all normal game of life rules
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:40:28] <jmcarthur>	yeah automata is cool
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:40:53] <jmcarthur>	i've seen complex machines built from life
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:40:57] <jmcarthur>	it's turing complete
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:41:08] <amstan>	yeah, like a game of life inside game of life
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:41:33] <amstan>	omg! and do another game of life from the big one
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:41:39] <amstan>	universe explodes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [13:41:44] <jmcarthur>	heh

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [15:58:52] <jhchrist>	so did we ever decide on the game? is it poker?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [15:59:43] <jmcarthur>	i don't think it's decided yet

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:00:32] <jmcarthur>	but i dont' like those options
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:00:37] <jhchrist>	thats a little old, though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:00:44] <jmcarthur>	i want an RTS
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:00:48] <jmcarthur>	is it?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:00:55] <jhchrist>	we discussed it yesterday
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:00:59] <jmcarthur>	it was only posted to reddit and the other channel like yesterday wasn't it?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:01:24] <jhchrist>	seems the results are turning up about 50/50 for the best games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:01:32] <jmcarthur>	jeff_cameron?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:02:00] <jmcarthur>	wait how do you see the results?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:02:09] <jhchrist>	ask jeff?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:02:35] <jhchrist>	http://jpcameron.com/blog/
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:02:49] <jmcarthur>	ah there
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:04:08] <jhchrist>	so we had some other suggestions tossed around: battleship, prisoners dilemma, poker
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:04:12] <jmcarthur>	jeff_cameron: the problem is that all the suggested games were turn based, "solvable" games and many have had a lot of research put into them already. i think most people are looking for something a but more unusually and less explored
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:04:23] <jmcarthur>	i want a dang RTS
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:04:39] <pgpaskar>	rts is way too involved
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:04:43] <jmcarthur>	prisoners dilemma has been very explored
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:04:51] <jmcarthur>	so has many variants of poker
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:07:32] <jhchrist>	can you describe how you would like the RTS to work?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:09:19] <jmcarthur>	jhchrist: well, of course there's always little details and balancing when it comes to an RTS, but i think that some minimalism might help with that. for example, don't bother with different types of units, or tiers, etc. use a system that is simple and derives such things somewhat inherently
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:09:29] <jmcarthur>	jhchrist: some earlier conversation about it http://pastebin.com/EQ7cmc5z
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:10:26] <jmcarthur>	line 53 is where one of my ideas starts
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:11:05] <jmcarthur>	i realize it's still a loose definitions of "simple" though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:11:56] <amstan>	how about battleship with the ships moving, continous time and space
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:20] <pgpaskar>	how about a different kind of rts
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:23] <pgpaskar>	the units are buildings
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:29] <pgpaskar>	and they produce eachother
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:31] <pgpaskar>	think stem cells
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:41] <jmcarthur>	like automata?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:42] <pgpaskar>	you start off with one
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:12:58] <pgpaskar>	and you can choose to make it something
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:13:06] <pgpaskar>	you can make something to produce more base ones
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:13:10] <jhchrist>	like zerg?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:13:14] <pgpaskar>	yeah like zerg
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:13:24] <pgpaskar>	but the limitation is that the units are simple
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:13:30] <pgpaskar>	and melee
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:13:54] <pgpaskar>	so you can have a unit that has low hp and massive damage, or the opposite, a balanced unit, and producers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:14:02] <pgpaskar>	you get a fixed income and each type of unit uses X amount of that income
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:14:13] <pgpaskar>	if you overproduce, you can't win
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:14:34] <pgpaskar>	find a balance between production and action, but the 3 units directly counter eachother
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:14:40] <jhchrist>	so how do we make sure that speedier languages don't have an edge? or do we embrace this?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:15:22] <jmcarthur>	i think implementation language should be a choice with consequences, personally
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:15:58] <jmcarthur>	if you write your AI in Ruby it's your fault if it's not fast enough
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:16:19] <pgpaskar>	you dont always need raw computation to win these games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:16:33] <pgpaskar>	this problem can't easily be solved by minimax
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:16:41] <jhchrist>	I'm just imagining angry forum posts...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:16:43] <pgpaskar>	or any raw-power algorithm, really
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:17:10] <pgpaskar>	such as?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:17:11] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: that's why i want to steer away from turn-based games and such. raw speed gives you a much bigger advantage for those since they often turn into tree pruning
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:18:05] <jmcarthur>	this was suggested on reddit. described as sort of a "real time risk" http://www.galcon.com/fusion/
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:18:12] <jhchrist>	love tghat game
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:18:13] <jmcarthur>	i've played either that game or similar games before. very fun
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:18:24] <jmcarthur>	and it's very simple, too
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:18:59] <pgpaskar>	oh that game ive played that before
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:19:14] <pgpaskar>	that woulda ctually be an amazing game for a challenge like this
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:19:23] <jhchrist>	maybe we should be looking to some small game developer for partnership
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:19:38] <jmcarthur>	yeah. if i don't have my way with a minimal but traditional rts, this is my second choice
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:19:47] <pgpaskar>	this is an rts
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:19:54] <jmcarthur>	but not a traditional one
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:19:58] <pgpaskar>	dont think in the computer-rts tank and infantry process
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:20:01] <pgpaskar>	those are way to complex
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:20:04] <jmcarthur>	right
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:20:07] <pgpaskar>	think just 'real time strategy'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:20:19] <jmcarthur>	i'm calling the tank and infantry style "traditional"
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:20:29] <pgpaskar>	dunno i'd call those modern
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:20:42] <pgpaskar>	anyyyywho
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:21:06] <jmcarthur>	anyway, yes, something like galcon would be awesome
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:21:10] <jmcarthur>	and fitting
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:23:54] <jmcarthur>	i've also been thinking about what the api for a rts ai should be like. it could either be continuous space and continuous time, in which case the AI just sends and receives messages asynchronously with a server i think, or continuous space but discrete time in which the AI is expected to respond each time it gets an update but those updates happen at regular intervals of virtual time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:24:14] <jmcarthur>	the latter would probably be more "fair" since it removes variables introduced by the timing of IPC
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:26:27] <jeff_cameron>	I am here. Just lemme catch up.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:27:15] <jhchrist>	we could probably do it in a discreet way while still making it real time enough
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:27:45] <jhchrist>	every action would simply generate an event. ship leaves planet, ship arrives at planet, ship generated at planet, etc...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:28:12] <jmcarthur>	my only concern with that is the fairness of the IPC
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:28:42] <jmcarthur>	if both players receive information at different rates, or the server gets messages fromt eh players at different rates, one of the players is at a disadvantage
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:29:04] <jhchrist>	true
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:29:17] <jhchrist>	then a "fast clock" is probably the sounder approach
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:29:35] <jhchrist>	shrink the dt until it looks continuous
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:30:48] <jmcarthur>	it needn't even "look" continuous unless we are watching the games in real time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:31:05] <jmcarthur>	heck, the animation doesn't even need to be the same speed as the actions
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:31:39] <jmcarthur>	even if each player only gets to act once or twice per second any animations we put in the visualizer can still look continuous
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:32:03] <jhchrist>	sure, but that visualizer isnt really the issue
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:32:07] <jmcarthur>	there would just be visible "ticks" where the players change things
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:32:09] <jeff_cameron>	jmcarthur and jhchrist: let me have your emails so I can add you as committers on the Google Code project. We should be wikifying these ideas so we can hash them out.

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:35:48] <jeff_cameron>	pgpaskar jmcarthur: you're both added. Do your worst.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:35:57] <pgpaskar>	Lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:36:17] <jeff_cameron>	Wikify this shit, lol.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:37:15] <jeff_cameron>	I think that Poker is probably the sexiest game we could choose at this point. If we can think about how to produce a really simple and elegant API for Poker, then we are off to the races.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:37:49] <jeff_cameron>	RTS is probably the most interesting game we could choose. Again, if we could come up with a really simple API, that would be golden.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:41:22] <jeff_cameron>	I mean, if we could come up with some sort of stripped-down RTS with a simple API, that would be the coolest shit ever.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:43:04] <pgpaskar>	I agree
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:43:50] <jeff_cameron>	What's this idea of having a one-unit RTS?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:10] <pgpaskar>	It wasn't really one unit rts it was more like the zerg from starcraft
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:16] <pgpaskar>	Where all their units are spawned from a single type of 'base' unit
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:23] <jeff_cameron>	Oh okay. No distinction between buildings and units.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:27] <pgpaskar>	you produce base units for free
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:38] <pgpaskar>	But it costs some resource to produce useful units
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:52] <pgpaskar>	And you have a fixed income which slowly declines (to ensure termination)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:44:57] <jeff_cameron>	What if we eliminate production completely. No resources, no buildings, no unit creation or upgrades. You start with N units, and that's all you get.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:45:39] <pgpaskar>	Depending on the mechanics, it might come down to a game of positioning
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:45:43] <jeff_cameron>	The focus would be on micro-management, rather than economic management.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:47:02] <pgpaskar>	dunno thats pretty unforgiving
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:47:10] <pgpaskar>	one small mistake to lose a single unit and it can cost you the entire game
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:47:38] <pgpaskar>	you also can't really 'counter' the other player since you'd both have equal footing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:47:54] <pgpaskar>	whereas in a game with basic production you can chose what type of unit to produce, perhaps one of three where they counter eachother
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:47:55] <pgpaskar>	like RPS
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:52:30] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: we should probably get some proper agreement for people that might want to volunteer for planning and running the contest
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:52:41] <amstan>	you know.. so nobody gets in the situation i was in
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:52:49] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: yeah you're right.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:53:16] <amstan>	here.. i can write that up
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:53:33] <jeff_cameron>	Use the Wiki.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:53:38] <amstan>	yep
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:53:41] <pgpaskar>	The google code wiki is hilarious
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:53:53] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: what's your email. I will add you to the project.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:54:01] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: mile92@gmail.com
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:54:09] <jeff_cameron>	Oh yeah. I knew that.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:55:23] <jeff_cameron>	Okay amstan you're added.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:55:27] <amstan>	k
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:55:46] <jeff_cameron>	You are welcome to create a Wiki page that outlines the downsides of becoming a project member.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:57:00] <jeff_cameron>	I am looking over Poker and RTS now. Even if we massively strip these games down, there's no way we're going to approach the level of simplicity that we had with Tron or RPS.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:57:55] <jeff_cameron>	With Tron, for example, the protocol was really simple. Engine sends map to client, client send back one of N, E, S, or W. Rinse and repeat.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [16:59:01] <pgpaskar>	Ugh, curses LuaJIT why dost thou changeth my varargs
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:00:18] <jmcarthur>	i do not like the idea of no resources or production in an rts. traditional RTSs are all about economy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:00:51] <pgpaskar>	Well for poker, you would send the hand, flop and bets of the players previous incl the blinds and whether they folded, checked, etc, then the current bot would return their choice of check call raise fold
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:00:51] <jmcarthur>	i think it would not be so strategic without that aspect
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:01:29] <pgpaskar>	nah jmcarthur
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:01:32] <jeff_cameron>	Fixed-Limit Hold 'em could work this way. Engine sends current state (including cards, current bets, pot size, whatever) to the client, client sends back one of bet, check, or fold.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:01:38] <pgpaskar>	rts games are about pressure
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:01:45] <pgpaskar>	good ones anyway
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:02:06] <jmcarthur>	pressure on economy. you interfere with your opponents ability to create units
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:02:12] <pgpaskar>	yeah it adds a dimension of pressure
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:02:21] <pgpaskar>	but its not 'all about the economy' as you can pressure production facilities straight up
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:02:29] <jmcarthur>	without that aspect you might as well just storm and micro
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:02:37] <pgpaskar>	uh no
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:03:14] <jmcarthur>	again i'm focusing on tanks and infantry style games here
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:03:25] <jmcarthur>	which i think is established as "not happening"
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:03:55] <pgpaskar>	have you ever played company of heroes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:00] <jmcarthur>	nope
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:14] <pgpaskar>	resources in that game are capture points
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:24] <pgpaskar>	that would be a neat system for something like this
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:33] <jmcarthur>	ah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:40] <pgpaskar>	the more of the map you control the more resources you get, the more units you can get
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:44] <jeff_cameron>	I think the more sophisticated RTS is a great game. We should do it at some point, just not now. Once we're releasing new contests at regular intervals, we can release "advanced" contests every now and then. Something for the power users.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:04:48] <pgpaskar>	yeah.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:05:59] <jmcarthur>	an rts in the style of galcon wouldn't have that complicated of an interface. just a protocol for sending unit positions and stats one way and unit commands the other way
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:06:19] <jmcarthur>	i don't even think the units in that game have states aside from the planets
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:06:23] <jmcarthur>	*stats
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:07:24] <jmcarthur>	i don't think poker would really be simpler. it's *less* data, sure, but it's more different *kinds* of data
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:09:50] <pgpaskar>	galcon would just be 'from a to b'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:09:57] <pgpaskar>	that would be the protocol for orders
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:04] <jmcarthur>	right
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:15] <pgpaskar>	and for input... continuous stream of who's & how many @ where?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:28] <pgpaskar>	well
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:29] <jmcarthur>	i don't even think it need be continuous
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:39] <jmcarthur>	i think discrete updates would be fine
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:43] <pgpaskar>	send then the diffs and they can build it themselves
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:56] <jmcarthur>	oh yeah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:56] <pgpaskar>	galcon seems like a cool game for this
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:10:59] <jmcarthur>	from a to b
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:04] <jmcarthur>	that would work both ways
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:18] <pgpaskar>	especially if you impliment nice planets like 2x growth or 2x strength or 2x defense
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:19] <jmcarthur>	yeah it grew on me and overpowered my desires for other games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:27] <jmcarthur>	my major vote is for galcon
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:38] <pgpaskar>	this is just screaming html5 canvas tags
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:40] <pgpaskar>	in my head
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:56] <jmcarthur>	were you the one that did the tron visualization
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:11:58] <jmcarthur>	?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:12:12] <jmcarthur>	or was that jeff?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:12:18] <pgpaskar>	yeah lmao, the hilarious css table
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:12:25] <jmcarthur>	heh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:14:17] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/OrganizingAgreement?ts=1272575649&updated=OrganizingAgreement
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:14:30] <jmcarthur>	the protocol definitely can't be continuously streaming if it is the player's responsibility to reconstruct the state of the game as updates come in
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:03] <pgpaskar>	hmm?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:04] <jeff_cameron>	Is there somewhere I can play Galcon for free? I wanna get a better idea what it's like.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:12] <pgpaskar>	Look for Phages on google
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:14] <pgpaskar>	its a similar game
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:29] <pgpaskar>	or I could just link it.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:43] <pgpaskar>	http://armorgames.com/play/4013/phage-wars-2
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:46] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: is it good? please refer people to it if you like it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:15:48] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: if the players and server can't sync up then they will all have differing views of the world
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:16:23] <jmcarthur>	eep i hope i am not being considered an organizer just for discussing ideas. i want to participate!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:16:36] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: yeah looks good. The most important piece is that if you're helping out with the contest, you can't be a participant.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:17:24] <jeff_cameron>	jmcarthur you should be good for now. Just being in the IRC room doesn't really count. It's mostly if you contribute code or have some sort of official responsibility like being a forum mod and such.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:18:09] <jmcarthur>	okay good. i would like it to be officially known now that i should be stopped if i am spotted treading into organizer territory
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:18:53] <jmcarthur>	i suppose too much prior information about the game that's chosen might be an unfair advantage too
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:19:26] <jeff_cameron>	jmcarthur: okay, noted. I should probably take you off contributor status on the project.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:19:33] <jmcarthur>	do so please
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:19:41] <jeff_cameron>	I am trying to relax these sorts of conflict of interest rules by open sourcing the project.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:19:54] <jmcarthur>	oh rock
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:19:56] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: that would be nice
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:20:02] <jeff_cameron>	In my mind, nothing would be better than to have the contestants themselves running the contest.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:21:20] <amstan>	oh darn.. we still need to get more people from #googleai
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:21:32] <jeff_cameron>	Well, hang on. Do I have to remove jmcarthur from the committers list? Even if he contributed code, that still doesn't give him any sort of inside advantage, does it? It's open-source.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:21:55] <amstan>	ok, let's change the agreement
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:21:55] <amstan>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:02] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:05] <jeff_cameron>	Well let's see. How does it look from the outside.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:17] <pgpaskar>	He has access ot the same information everyone else has...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:23] <pgpaskar>	Anyone can look at the code
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:24] <jmcarthur>	if i have prior knowledge about how things will work before the contest starts i could have already started an entry
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:32] <pgpaskar>	Last time we all had access to code and nobody else did
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:34] <jmcarthur>	i guess everybody else could have too though...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:35] <jeff_cameron>	I guess if someone's name is on the committers' list, and they win the contest, it looks rigged. Especially if there's prize money from sponsors.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:37] <pgpaskar>	It's not like he'll have access to the container
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:22:39] <amstan>	pgpaskar: except he [will] contributed some ideas and changes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:23:17] <pgpaskar>	It seems a bit silly to say you have to be isolated and walled off from the organizers to suggest a game, it's not like we're letting him pick the game or the implimentation
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:23:28] <amstan>	yeah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:23:31] <jmcarthur>	certainly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:23:33] <jeff_cameron>	I think it would look terrible if a committer won the contest. Therefore, committers shouldn't be allowed to participate themselves.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:23:49] <pgpaskar>	I agree with not submitting code though... that would appear a bit fishy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:23:57] <jmcarthur>	should it even be permissible to know what the game will be in advance?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:06] <jmcarthur>	i guess that wouldn't be helped if it's open source?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:06] <pgpaskar>	But looking at the engine code and suggesting ideas would be fine, I mean everybody does that I would hope
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:08] <amstan>	jmcarthur: i don't see why not?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:17] <jmcarthur>	just seems like i coudl start early
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:23] <amstan>	jmcarthur: in tron people had an advantage if they made a tronbot before
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:34] <jeff_cameron>	If somebody like jmcarthur suggests a game and we accept it and build it, then jmcarthur wins, does that look bad? I think it looks fine.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:47] <amstan>	yes, it does
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:24:58] <pgpaskar>	It doesn't look bad at all
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:12] <jmcarthur>	alright
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:18] <pgpaskar>	Unless he competed in a previous competition and recycled his code..
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:18] <amstan>	yeah, i meant it doesn't look bad
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:19] <jeff_cameron>	I don't think it looks bad. All the stuff about which game we're choosing is on the public Wiki: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameIdeas
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:27] <pgpaskar>	bute ven then it doesn't really matter because he still wrote it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:42] <amstan>	ok, changing wording
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:46] <jmcarthur>	brb
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:53] <pgpaskar>	Like if you're trying to eliminate the future Accoun, nothing you can do will stop it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:25:58] <pgpaskar>	Bitchers will be bitchers if they lose :\
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:26:14] <pgpaskar>	I could have chosen a better word but I like the sharpness of that one.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:26:43] <amstan>	you can say that again
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:26:46] <amstan>	he kept coming back
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:27:01] <amstan>	with other mistyped usernames: usernam, dress, accoun
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:27:42] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: I think the article should focus on who is and is not allowed to participate in the contests. The article can be as simple as a bulleted list of examples. Who is not allowed to participate? (1) Anyone with commit access on any code repo in the last 12 months. (2) Anyone with physical access to the contest systems. (3) Anyone with official responsibilities related to the contest.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:29:07] <jeff_cameron>	We'll never be able to get rid of crackpots, for sure. However, if a committer wins the contest, there are going to be non-crackpots up in arms about conflict of interest and rigging, and they will be right.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:29:10] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: there, i added that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:29:17] <pgpaskar>	Yeah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:29:33] <pgpaskar>	As long as we can keep bias claims with merrit a non-issue, we're fine
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:29:50] <pgpaskar>	Which basically means anyone who has influence over the competition shouldn't be able to participate in it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:29:59] <amstan>	wait...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:06] <pgpaskar>	Unless your mum really wants to enter, and if she does, good on her! (lol)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:14] <amstan>	"Anyone with commit access on any code repo in the last 12 months.", that pretty much disqualifies any developrs out there
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:27] <amstan>	since it's ANY repo
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:29] <pgpaskar>	any of our code repos
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:30] <jeff_cameron>	I mean the contests's code repo.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:41] <amstan>	ok, kinda funny though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:30:47] <pgpaskar>	reasoning for this is obvious, reusing code from tron perhaps
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:31:29] <jeff_cameron>	How about this: anyone who has committed code to the project in the last 12 months.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:31:48] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: already changed it to "Anyone with commit access on any relevant code repository in the last 12 months."
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:32:25] <pgpaskar>	Be specific, amstan, (1) The Tron Contest repository, (2) This repository, (3) The Rock-Paper-Scissors repository
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:32:33] <pgpaskar>	If there are more that I don't know of, whoops ¦]
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:33:11] <amstan>	older ones are meh..
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:33:24] <pgpaskar>	Maybe not the RPS repo.. lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:33:31] <amstan>	pretty sure there's no backdoors in them that went unnoticed that will cause someone to win this contest
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:33:44] <amstan>	or any other backdoors for that matter
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:34:10] <amstan>	k, guys, you're mostly all in the project, you can edit the page yourselves
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:38:06] <jeff_cameron>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:38:19] <jeff_cameron>	Big secret guys. You better sit down.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:38:26] <jeff_cameron>	There WAS no repo for the RPS contest!!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:38:32] <jmcarthur>	commit access to any "relevant" repository also doesn't cut it. what if a linux kernel developer wants to play?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:38:39] <jeff_cameron>	It was just me writing so very many bash scripts.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:39:12] <jeff_cameron>	Why don't we just say "any person who has committed code to this project in the last 12 months"
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:39:21] <jmcarthur>	that sounds best to me
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:40:48] <jmcarthur>	looks like i can still comment on the wiki, so i can still document ideas without editing the wiki
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:40:56] <jmcarthur>	it's just more ad hoc is all
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:07] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:09] <pgpaskar>	Really jeff_cameron?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:24] <jeff_cameron>	pgpaskar really.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:30] <pgpaskar>	haha
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:36] <pgpaskar>	And if something got royally bricked?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:43] <jeff_cameron>	Then the contest would be over.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:47] <pgpaskar>	oh wow
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:51] <jeff_cameron>	Oh, and no security.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:54] <pgpaskar>	Thats like the only reason I use git and svn really
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:44:59] <pgpaskar>	In case I royally muck something up
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:45:05] <pgpaskar>	V. good for CS assignments
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:45:13] <jeff_cameron>	If someone had submitted a bash script that does "cd ../..; rm -rf *" the contest would have abruptly stopped.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:45:27] <pgpaskar>	;_;
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:45:31] <jeff_cameron>	Oh yeah.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:45:58] <jeff_cameron>	I can be forgiven though. In the contest before *that* one, I got only six entries.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:46:57] <jeff_cameron>	This Galcon game is pretty bitchin.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:47:03] <jmcarthur>	would i be considered an "organizer" if i contributed a starter package once other details have been worked out?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:47:09] <jmcarthur>	i am guessing not
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:47:22] <jmcarthur>	i would be willing to do that though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:47:51] <jeff_cameron>	It all depends on how it looks from the outside. We took started packages from contestants last time. I think that was fine.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:48:38] <jmcarthur>	i assume such things would not go into the "project repository" though, would they?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:48:48] <jmcarthur>	i guess it doesn't imply i have commit access either way
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:49:04] <jeff_cameron>	The starter packages do go into the repo yeah. But you wouldn't be committing them.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:49:09] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:49:48] <jeff_cameron>	The whole idea behind open-sourcing the project on Google Code is so that more people can contribute, hopefully without disqualifying themselves.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:49:56] <jmcarthur>	awesome
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:53:33] <jeff_cameron>	So what about Galcon? What would it look like?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:53:51] <jmcarthur>	look like in what sense?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:53:55] <jeff_cameron>	Would there be delay between sending ships and them arriving?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:54:08] <jmcarthur>	oh. yeah i think that would be best
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:54:11] <jmcarthur>	otherwise it's just risk
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:54:18] <jeff_cameron>	Or would the players submit their moves, and the moves be carried out simulatenously like with Tron?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:55:05] <jmcarthur>	i think it should be continuous time (doesn't have to be actually run that way of course) with discrete moments that players can give orders
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:55:22] <jeff_cameron>	Good idea.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:55:40] <jeff_cameron>	Are there any situations that can turn into trivial stalemates?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:07] <jmcarthur>	i don't think so, but that doesn't mean a game can't go one for a long time, especially with potentially dumb ai
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:09] <jeff_cameron>	Like, 5 blue planets and 5 red planets, with a large space between them?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:18] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:22] <jmcarthur>	possibly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:23] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah, there is a huge potential for a draw.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:32] <jmcarthur>	even if not, two bad AIs could draw
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:38] <jmcarthur>	since unlike tron it can't "fill up"
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:43] <jeff_cameron>	Right.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:53] <jeff_cameron>	Can we introduce some modification to ensure that it ends?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:56:57] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:57:33] <jmcarthur>	maybe just have a time limit and whoever has the most planets at the end of that time period wins?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:57:54] <jmcarthur>	that would have the best guarantee of timely termination and is tweakable
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:58:29] <jeff_cameron>	Oh right, right.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:58:37] <jeff_cameron>	Or perhaps the person with the largest "sum".
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:58:45] <jeff_cameron>	Like, the sum of all the numbers on their planets.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:58:50] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:59:25] <jmcarthur>	that would actually be better
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:59:37] <jeff_cameron>	So there are a couple approaches to connectivity.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [17:59:40] <jmcarthur>	prevent crazy last second rushes to get the most planets
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:00:16] <jeff_cameron>	(1) all planets are connected to each other, but have different delays between them
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:00:46] <jeff_cameron>	(2) all planets are connected, and have zero distance to one another. The players submit their moves simulaneously, and they're carried out simultaneously.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:01:15] <jeff_cameron>	(3) not all planets are connected. The planets would be vertices of a planar graph.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:01:15] <jmcarthur>	i vote for either 1 or a variation on 1
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:01:27] <jmcarthur>	ah, 3 is the variation i was goign to say
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:01:50] <jmcarthur>	a weighted graph
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:07] <jeff_cameron>	Ah, a weighted graph.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:13] <jeff_cameron>	What are the semantics of the weights?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:19] <jeff_cameron>	Is the weight a time delay?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:23] <jmcarthur>	large weights = more time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:24] <jmcarthur>	yeah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:34] <jeff_cameron>	So a weighted graph approach is approach (1).
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:02:59] <jmcarthur>	depends on if you are allowed to change orders before ships arrive
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:03:11] <jmcarthur>	if you are, they are equivalent
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:03:14] <jeff_cameron>	Oh snap. That would be madness.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:03:39] <jmcarthur>	if not, the weighted graph means you could turn around at "waypoint" planets
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:03:52] <jmcarthur>	but approach 1 would not allow anything like that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:04:24] <jeff_cameron>	How about the planets are on a fully connected weighted planar graph, where the weights are the distances (times) between each pair of planets.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:04:44] <jeff_cameron>	And the weights are all integers.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:04:45] <jmcarthur>	need they be fully connected?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:04:59] <jeff_cameron>	In the original game, it's fully connected.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:05:03] <jmcarthur>	oh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:05:11] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:05:15] <jeff_cameron>	Like, you can send ships between any two planets.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:06:32] <jeff_cameron>	But they take a certain discrete number of turns to get there.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:06:46] <jmcarthur>	what does "fully connected" in combination with "planar" mean?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:07:26] <jeff_cameron>	Fully connected means that every node is connected to every other node.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:07:46] <jmcarthur>	yeah, i don't think planar graphs can always be fully connected, can they?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:08:12] <jeff_cameron>	Planar means that it can be drawn on a flat 2D surface without crossing any lines. Okay, it's a bit of a misnomer. The graphs wouldn't actually be planar, because we would allow crossed lines.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:08:21] <jeff_cameron>	You're right, I messed up.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:08:28] <jeff_cameron>	They're not planar.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:08:49] <jmcarthur>	heck, we could even pretend it's 3D or 4D or 5D or whatever ;)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:08:50] <jeff_cameron>	What I mean is that the weights are roughly proportional to the cartesian distance between the planets.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:09:14] <jeff_cameron>	So we can't have arbitrary graphs. The graphs have to be "drawable".
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:09:15] <jmcarthur>	2D is easy to visualize though of course
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:09:19] <jmcarthur>	yeah i follow
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:10:09] <jmcarthur>	okay, so fully connected, weighted, no changing commands during travel
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:10:27] <pgpaskar>	lmao 4D
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:10:31] <jmcarthur>	you have to pick your target and the way you want to get there intelligently
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:10:32] <pgpaskar>	travel through time with your spaceships
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:10:41] <pgpaskar>	now that would add a level of complexity that would just be silly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:10:59] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: well i just means that the weights would be calculated according to distance in 4D space
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:11:06] <jmcarthur>	*mean
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:11:23] <jmcarthur>	it would just be complication in the visualizer, not the AI or server
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:11:29] <jmcarthur>	but i digress
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:11:41] <pgpaskar>	'but i digress' is the best phrase ever, just saying.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:12:19] <jmcarthur>	well i'm about to leave work
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:12:31] <jeff_cameron>	Aight.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:12:38] <jmcarthur>	i'm already excited about this though, if this is the game we will be doing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:13:00] <jeff_cameron>	I don't like that you send out ships, then don't see them again for a bunch of turns, until they arrive at the destination.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:13:02] <jmcarthur>	now i wonder how long i will have to wait! >:(
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:13:10] <jeff_cameron>	Early May.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:13:25] <jmcarthur>	well, you could always just take the long way around if you need more control between leaving and arriving
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:13:38] <jeff_cameron>	That's what I am thinking.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:13:51] <jeff_cameron>	Single-step travel, with non-fully-connected graphs.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:03] <jmcarthur>	well, i wasn't quite thinking that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:04] <jeff_cameron>	So to get across the map, it still takes a bunch of time.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:08] <jmcarthur>	you are describing risk ;)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:26] <jeff_cameron>	Basically, yeah. Except with simultaneous moves.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:35] <jmcarthur>	well actually i think in risk you can move to any connected node in a single turn as long as you control it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:39] <jeff_cameron>	And non-dice-based battles.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:14:40] <jmcarthur>	yeah and it's turn based
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:15:31] <jmcarthur>	single step travel would be a reasonable compromise i guess
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:16:04] <jeff_cameron>	It just takes the state out of the protocol.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:16:24] <jmcarthur>	i just like the idea of choosing between a fast route with less control or a slow route with more control
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:16:58] <jeff_cameron>	That's a strategic element, for sure. It's one of the biggest elements in Galcon.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:17:16] <jmcarthur>	yeah, and you kind of lose that with single step movement
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:17:42] <jmcarthur>	i do agree that if there are weights they should be integers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:18:00] <jmcarthur>	that would make things nice and discrete without no floating point oddities or other complications
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:18:38] <jmcarthur>	okay, i'm actually leaving work now. bbl
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:18:46] <jeff_cameron>	Thanks for the ideas, man.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:22:16] <pgpaskar>	For the travel stuff, is it going to be ship-by-ship or a fleet of X ships that you control together
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:24:47] <jeff_cameron>	One option is to send out N ships at a time, with a definite destination. After the time delay (if there is one), they would all arrive together.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:25:01] <jeff_cameron>	So it would be in groups of ships. There is no opportunity to control individual ships.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:29:31] <jeff_cameron>	What do you think, Patrick?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:29:54] <jeff_cameron>	I mean, pgpaskar.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:30:21] <pgpaskar>	Yar, I'm just thinking about neat ways of making all the planets within integer distance of eachother
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:30:23] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:30:55] <pgpaskar>	I like the idea
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:31:01] <jeff_cameron>	Oh snap. That's a programming problem all its own.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:31:32] <jeff_cameron>	Literally: http://www.azspcs.net/Contest/PointPacking
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:31:53] <pgpaskar>	Oh hahaha
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:33:33] <jeff_cameron>	We don't need to make them actually be integers.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:33:37] <pgpaskar>	I'll toss together a js script to let you draw maps with points to intersect at integer distances at some point but I can foresee this becoming very difficult for a map of m planets where m gets huuuuuge.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:33:49] <pgpaskar>	and by huge I mean 25
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:34:08] <jeff_cameron>	Think about what would happens if the distances are real numbers, but you only have the opportunity to made decisions at integer intervals.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:34:16] <pgpaskar>	Yeah that's true
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:34:23] <pgpaskar>	I guess we could just take the ceiling
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:35:05] <jeff_cameron>	Right.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:35:17] <jeff_cameron>	So the planets can be placed wherever.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:37:08] <pgpaskar>	Now we need a catchy name
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:37:46] <pgpaskar>	Also question of mechanics, will the bots be able to chose how many ships travel or should it be like Phage Wars where it always takes half of the ships on your planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:38:03] <pgpaskar>	I personally think the latter is an interesting mechanic because it stops you from sending 1 ship to every planet immediately
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:44:16] <jmcarthur>	i wouldn't worry too much about making the weights line up with the positions perfectly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:45:20] <jmcarthur>	hmm, half the ships from the planet sounds nice
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:45:36] <jmcarthur>	what about sending two groups from a planet in one turn? would the be permissible?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:45:50] <jmcarthur>	like if you have 100 ships on the planet, the first group is 50 and the second is 25
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:08] <pgpaskar>	No
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:14] <pgpaskar>	Each planet gets one move per packet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:19] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:21] <pgpaskar>	Once that packet is executed, half the ships are gone
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:34] <jmcarthur>	zero or one? or exactly one?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:34] <pgpaskar>	But it rounds to the ceiling on the planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:40] <pgpaskar>	So if you have 5 and you click to move
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:42] <pgpaskar>	it sends 2, keeps 3
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:46:50] <jmcarthur>	i guess zero or one
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:02] <jmcarthur>	that sounds reasonable though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:08] <pgpaskar>	Well the empty move is still a move
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:12] <jmcarthur>	right
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:14] <pgpaskar>	=]
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:15] <jmcarthur>	mmkay
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:26] <jmcarthur>	i kind of like the half rule, kind of don't
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:45] <jmcarthur>	i should play a few variants and see how i feel about it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:47:48] <jmcarthur>	it's been a while
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:48:07] <jmcarthur>	of course, i don't play like an AI would
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:50:20] <jmcarthur>	should this just be 1 vs. 1 like the last competition? this game lends itself well to battle royale, but i guess that would also be more complicated. also not very suitable for a tournament, really
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:56:05] <pgpaskar>	If you state that the game will be a battle royal, that means it should also function with just 2 players
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:56:10] <pgpaskar>	Whereas claiming it is 1v1 limits it to this
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:56:16] <pgpaskar>	but it's probably a bit more complicated adding more palyers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:56:35] <pgpaskar>	On the other hand it does make it very enjoyable, especially if players can request matches to be run =]
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:57:38] <pgpaskar>	Lol, what would be really amazing is if we published a home client as well, right, but included instructions for how to use git and instructions for the following: allow players to play their current submission in a battle royal with previous ones
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:57:47] <jmcarthur>	another question: if all of a player's planets are captured but he has ships en route does he lose or does he get a chance to keep playing?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:00] <jmcarthur>	phage wars seems to make him lose in that case
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:04] <jmcarthur>	i dunno about other variants
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:13] <pgpaskar>	Yeah but phage wars isn't perfect
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:21] <pgpaskar>	But usuallly... a smart AI will _make_ you lose
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:32] <jmcarthur>	i think if you still have ships then you haven't lost yet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:32] <pgpaskar>	it'll just shove everything it can at the one your fleet is targetting ;o
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [18:58:50] <pgpaskar>	brb
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:10:34] <jmcarthur>	i wonder what fun would come about if it was not only not fully connected, but directed as well
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:16:52] <jmcarthur>	i'm not expecting anybody to jump on this as a game to do, but my dad and uncle made this http://www.google.com/patents?id=-SMnAAAAEBAJ&lpg=PA10&zoom=4&ots=UMBOXGnt2r&dq=polaritease&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=polaritease&f=false
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:17:42] <jmcarthur>	i thought of it when i was thinking about directed graphs (the board in the patent is also directed)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:18:54] <jeff_cameron>	I think directed is a bad idea, hehe.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:18:58] <jmcarthur>	we produced hundreds of these, sold a few i think, then abandoned it. i never asked why
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:19:16] <jmcarthur>	so i run into boxes full of them every once in a while
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:19:27] <jeff_cameron>	Directed links are like a "I can punch you, but you can't punch me back" situation.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:19:32] <jmcarthur>	right
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:19:47] <jmcarthur>	but maybe i can swing around and punch you where it hurts while you punch me
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:20:00] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:20:19] <jmcarthur>	probably just turns into a bag of hurt though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:21:48] <jeff_cameron>	Did you guys talk any more about fully-connected vs not fully connected?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:23:33] <jmcarthur>	no we didn't really
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:24:03] <jmcarthur>	we talked about how many units could be moved at a time though. i didn't see you leave though. it should be visible in your backlog
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:25:05] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah I read that.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:25:17] <jeff_cameron>	Why not let them choose?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:25:53] <jmcarthur>	it stops you from sending 1 ship to every planet right off the bat
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:26:28] <jeff_cameron>	If the planets start off as neutral and have some units occupying them already, then sending one ship to each planet hurts you.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:26:52] <jmcarthur>	well, not really, because every planet you hold gains you units over time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:27:40] <jmcarthur>	i don't think that would be cheating per se since both players can technically do it, but i also think the games would be less interesting if after the first turn the whole playing field is essentially uniformly covered
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:27:57] <jmcarthur>	or will be after a few more turns, anyway
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:28:18] <jmcarthur>	oh you mean if there are neutral units?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:28:24] <jmcarthur>	that you have to fight off first?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:28:28] <jeff_cameron>	Having most planets start off as neutral with some neutral occupying units would fix that problem I believe.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:28:34] <jmcarthur>	aha
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:28:38] <jmcarthur>	yeah that would work too
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:28:47] <jeff_cameron>	Also, having the map be not fully connected.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:29:00] <jeff_cameron>	Or time delays. Either way.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:29:02] <jmcarthur>	if neutral units are in place then i have no issue with being able to send arbitrary numbers of units
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:29:41] <jmcarthur>	i think i like keeping the possibility of time delays and non-fully-connected graphs open
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:29:51] <jmcarthur>	might lead to more interesting maps
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:30:15] <jmcarthur>	but if i had to choose i would prefer time delays over non-fully-connected graphs
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:30:59] <jmcarthur>	but the protocol would probably look the same either way
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:31:43] <jmcarthur>	each connection could look like: <node> <node> <weight> \n       or something like that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:32:00] <jmcarthur>	and you could just leave connections out if you don't want the graph to be fully connected
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:32:31] <jmcarthur>	i guess that's not protocol so much as map format
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:38:06] <jmcarthur>	basically all i mean is if we are doing time delays anyway the not being fully connected is optional with exactly the same code
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:38:39] <jmcarthur>	but not the other way around
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:39:31] Join	jhchrist has joined this channel (~jhchrist@69-165-131-73.dsl.teksavvy.com).
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:40:48] <jhchrist>	any more thoughts on the game to play?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:41:36] <jeff_cameron>	We're just talking about Galcon.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:41:46] <jeff_cameron>	Try it out: http://www.galcon.com/flash/
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:42:15] <jeff_cameron>	If you simplify it enough, it basically turns into a really slick version of Risk.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:42:30] <jhchrist>	I've bought the real thing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:42:36] <jhchrist>	love it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:43:24] <jhchrist>	wow -- the flash version is really shitty
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:43:50] <jeff_cameron>	And I like the flash version!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:44:02] <jhchrist>	compared to the client-side game?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:44:06] <jhchrist>	really?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:44:38] <jmcarthur>	the cliend side game is even better
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:44:44] <jmcarthur>	*client
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:45:32] <jhchrist>	so is there any intention of getting some kind of arrangement with the game developer, or are we just shamelessly copying it?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:45:44] <jhchrist>	I'm fine either way, I'm just curious
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:46:49] <jeff_cameron>	We'll be simplifying it tremendously, it should be substantially different.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:47:03] <jhchrist>	what are you going to cut?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:47:47] <jeff_cameron>	The name, the graphics, many elements of the gameplay.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:47:57] <jeff_cameron>	By the time we're done, it will just be a game on a graph.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:48:13] <jeff_cameron>	Alright, going out to shoot some pool for a bit. Be back in an hour and a bit.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:48:31] <jhchrist>	is there still going to be transit time between one vertex and another?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:48:42] <jeff_cameron>	I will Wikify my conception of this game this evening, and post it here.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:48:48] <jhchrist>	sounds good
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:48:50] <jeff_cameron>	That's one element we have to decide yet.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:49:00] <jhchrist>	any ideas for a name?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:49:27] <jeff_cameron>	There are two major options: one is to have a fully connected graph, with transit time between nodes. The other option is to have no transit time, but not fully connected.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:49:38] <jeff_cameron>	Calgon?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:49:42] <jhchrist>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:49:48] <jhchrist>	maybe a little obvious
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:49:53] <jeff_cameron>	Maybe.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:50:21] <jeff_cameron>	If we go with non-fully-connected with zero transit time, it basically turns into a simplified Risk.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [19:50:26] <jeff_cameron>	Anyways, be back in a bit.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:23:02] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: another negative for the "you can only move one group from each planet per turn" rule is that it makes the game simple enough that a tree pruning algorithm is feasible
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:23:25] <jmcarthur>	well, that might be a negative depending on your tastes, at least
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:23:43] <pgpaskar>	Well you can successively move stuff, what I meant was
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:23:50] <pgpaskar>	what I meant by that was
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:24:09] <pgpaskar>	If you move X from planet G, where X > the total amount on G
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:24:16] <pgpaskar>	you can't ask it to move X again at the same time to a different planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:24:23] <jmcarthur>	oh i see
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:24:25] <jmcarthur>	that's not what i meant
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:24:36] <jmcarthur>	i meant moving two groups from the same planet at the same time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:24:50] <pgpaskar>	Oh no I'm fine with that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:25:12] <pgpaskar>	I just meant you have to do it consecutively
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:25:12] <jmcarthur>	if X is connected to Y and Z, and X has n ships, can you move n/2 ships to Y and n/4 ships to Z?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:25:20] <pgpaskar>	This was more because I thought of that 50% moves 50% stays thing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:25:31] <pgpaskar>	So you would move 50% then 25% then 12.5%... etc
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:25:36] <jmcarthur>	okay
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:25:50] <pgpaskar>	Ya thats perfectly fine
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:26:03] <pgpaskar>	I just meant you can't move to two places at the same instant because that would be chaotic lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:26:12] <jmcarthur>	it still makes the breadth of a search tree smaller when you have the 50% rule though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:26:53] <jmcarthur>	*of the game tree
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:27:26] <jmcarthur>	we had a very narrow game tree with tron already. would be nice to change that up
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:27:46] <pgpaskar>	You are aware that stuff isn't staying static right? The ships you have in each planet change depending on the size of the planet as per the actual game rules wouldn't that complicate your tree a bit?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:27:47] <jmcarthur>	this is still a much larger tree than tron at least
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:28:33] <pgpaskar>	Also if this is real time, if someone wants to go to the trouble to burn cycles computing minimax results while the other guy is just using a 'coded' strategy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:28:40] <pgpaskar>	I mean I think minimax will fall behind as the board gets bigger
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:29:00] <jmcarthur>	minimax would be even more wrong for this than it would be for tron, i think
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:29:04] <jmcarthur>	*than it was for tron
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:30:33] <jmcarthur>	well, i just thought about it more. the 50% rules still allows for a very wide tree, you're right
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:32:08] <jmcarthur>	with tron minimax was forgiving because it was uncommon for there not to be dominant moves. with this i see dominant moves being a lot less common
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:36:26] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: jeff_cameron also suggested that there could be neutral units on the unoccupied planets which you have to fight before you can capture new planets. this would prevent the rush to capture every planet with one unit
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:36:55] <jmcarthur>	it's a common trick in 2 player risk games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [20:37:01] <jmcarthur>	and works out nicely
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:06:29] <jhchrist>	so if we go with the 50% and no transit time delays, how would this still be an RTS? the cap would have to be 50% per turn, so now we have a turn-based game, right?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:07:00] <pgpaskar>	I'm not in support of no transit time delay lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:07:12] <pgpaskar>	That just means the fastest language wins
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:07:15] <jhchrist>	oh, so why the 50% rule?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:07:27] <pgpaskar>	Just so that you can't send precise amounts to eliminate planets
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:07:47] <pgpaskar>	basically
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:07:55] <pgpaskar>	If you have 90 ships on a planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:08:00] <pgpaskar>	and you need 89 to win
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:08:14] <jhchrist>	why would you tell the AI how many ships the opponent has?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:08:28] <pgpaskar>	Because to do otherwise is to fire blindly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:08:48] <jhchrist>	and?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:08:59] <pgpaskar>	And then it becomes a game of blind guessing?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:09:12] <jhchrist>	not if you give the AIs hints
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:09:19] <pgpaskar>	I'm confused by what you propose
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:09:55] <jhchrist>	with humans in this game, you can see the opponent move ships, but you don't know exactly how many -- you get a general feel for how many but you don't know exactly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:10:12] <jhchrist>	you can't see how many ships are on a planet, but you can sort of track it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:10:45] <jhchrist>	if we were to... generalize the information given about an enemy movement, we could force the AIs to do that same kind of guessing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:10:48] <jmcarthur>	the AI could keep a running total of the opponent's ships on each planet anyway
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:11:02] <jmcarthur>	unless you have a fog of war or something
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:11:32] <jhchrist>	say player 1 moves 137 ships from planet A to planet B. We might tell the other AIs that player 1 moved ~100 +/- 50 ships from A to B
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:12:07] <jmcarthur>	eh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:12:53] <pgpaskar>	I dunno I think that just introduces noise
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:12:57] <jmcarthur>	there's already uncertainty about what the next move will be. i think uncertainty about what the previous move was is just going to be overkill
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:13:12] <jhchrist>	meh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:13:17] <pgpaskar>	Like what that means is that you need to send exactly 151 units to win that planet, lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:13:29] <pgpaskar>	Sure you could play gamble with units
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:13:35] <pgpaskar>	but I think it just overcomplicates
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:13:38] <jhchrist>	sure, but you might be overcommitting
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:13:53] <pgpaskar>	I dunno I think it would just make it too random
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:04] <jmcarthur>	i'd rather have randomness affect the fights than make the information given to the AI vague
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:09] <jhchrist>	with humans, you could send every ship you have, and you'd be sure to take the planet, but that doesn't make it a good idea
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:18] <pgpaskar>	the 50% thing is to stop players from sending out an entire planet or a very small amount
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:22] <pgpaskar>	it doesn't mean you can only send 50%
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:27] <pgpaskar>	it means you can send 50% out one time, planet now has 50%
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:33] <pgpaskar>	you can issue another order and move 50% of that too...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:37] <pgpaskar>	but you can't send 99% to attack a single planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:41] <pgpaskar>	unless you spam orders on it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:48] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: does your 50% rule prevent the player from sending two groups from A to B in the same turn?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:14:53] <jhchrist>	and what is to stop spamming?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:15:09] <jmcarthur>	you just answered my questions
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:15:29] <amstan>	yay, i'm back
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:15:32] <amstan>	what did i miss?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:15:34] <jmcarthur>	the 50% rule effectively just prevents you from sending *fewer* than 50%, not more
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:15:35] <jhchrist>	also, turns? how long is a turn relative to travel time?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:15:40] <jhchrist>	ah
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:00] <pgpaskar>	jhchrist, my vision is not to have it real time as in move everything at once
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:04] <jmcarthur>	amstan: a lot
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:21] <pgpaskar>	think starcraft, you can move pretty fast but, there's a limit to the speed you can outright give orders... you can just give them as much as you want
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:27] <jmcarthur>	i am in favor of discrete time steps, but where traveling might take more than one step
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:45] <pgpaskar>	Hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:48] <jmcarthur>	and you can't change units' commands en route
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:16:52] <pgpaskar>	See I guess you would have to limit how fast stuff comes out of a planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:01] <pgpaskar>	like per 'unit of time' you can issue a single move for every planet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:17] <jmcarthur>	right. that's what i'm thinking
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:19] <pgpaskar>	The point is your ships wouldn't arrive at the same time, they're delayed
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:31] <pgpaskar>	so if the other guy sees WAVES of stuff pulsating out of your planets...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:35] <jmcarthur>	hmm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:39] <pgpaskar>	they can shuffle dudes into the one being attacked
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:17:46] <pgpaskar>	It's tactical like that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:11] <pgpaskar>	You'd have 50 small battles vs 1 single takeover
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:11] <jhchrist>	do we tell the other AIs where the ships are headed?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:15] <pgpaskar>	that's the point of the 50% rule
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:21] <pgpaskar>	Dunno, haven't made that call
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:25] <pgpaskar>	But you can tell them the direction lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:42] <jhchrist>	uhh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:44] <jhchrist>	direction?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:46] <jmcarthur>	i was just thinking that both players can see each others' others directly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:52] <jmcarthur>	*others' orders
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:18:53] <pgpaskar>	think of the planets on a grid
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:19:05] <jhchrist>	its not just a graph?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:19:14] <jmcarthur>	i prefer a graph
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:19:16] <pgpaskar>	I don't know actually
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:19:35] <jmcarthur>	graphs are simpler and would look better
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:20:03] <pgpaskar>	Yeah thats true I guess...
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:20:37] <pgpaskar>	If you don't tell them the oponents orders... then it becomes a guessing game again
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:20:41] <pgpaskar>	stabbing in the dark if you will, lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:20:49] <jhchrist>	to be fair, when it really counts, you can usually tell where the units are going
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:21:06] <jmcarthur>	a time delay for ships to get from one planet to another and fully shared information is enough to give an opponent a chance to counteract an attack, at least slightly
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:21:23] <jmcarthur>	where the time delay is just "it takes n turns to get from here to there"
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:21:38] <jmcarthur>	some trips might only take 1 turn, some might take 4, whatever
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:00] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: another argument against 50% rule: you say the point is to prevent the AI from sending only exactly what's needed. if there is travel time then the AI won't necessarily know exactly what's needed
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:10] <jmcarthur>	since the situation changes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:27] <jhchrist>	if trips only take 1 turn, whats to keep someone from bouncing most of their ships between two close planets and sending the carefully calculated 'rest' to the enemy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:43] <jmcarthur>	why even bother bouncing between two planets?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:50] <jmcarthur>	you don't have to move them every turn
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:55] <pgpaskar>	jhchrist play this game: http://armorgames.com/play/4013/phage-wars-2
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:23:58] <jhchrist>	to get a smaller than 50% amount
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:24:06] <pgpaskar>	This is where I got the 505 thing from
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:24:08] <pgpaskar>	50% *
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:24:12] <jmcarthur>	well, it still takes time to do that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:24:37] <jmcarthur>	i feel like phage did the 50% rule to keep the controls simple, not to add a strategic element to the game
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:24:50] <jmcarthur>	at least that is my conclusion after a few games
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:25:49] <jhchrist>	also, even if the situation changes, the ai would know how fast ships are generatesd and could compensate
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:26:54] <pgpaskar>	I still like it though but w/e
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:27:00] <pgpaskar>	Forget the 50% rule
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:27:52] <jhchrist>	was there some cap on the number of moves total you can make per turn?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:28:21] <jhchrist>	that might prevent a bunch of small precise fights... needing to do more important things
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:28:44] <jmcarthur>	jhchrist: ship generation is not the only factor. it's also enemy movement
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:29:07] <jmcarthur>	the only way to account for it is to send more than is needed
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:29:15] <jhchrist>	true, but you also know the total number of ships that can get there before you
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:29:18] <jmcarthur>	and if you do that then the enemy will not even try fighting and run away
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:29:26] <jmcarthur>	so you way overcompensate
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:29:31] <jhchrist>	true
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:29:34] <jmcarthur>	the 50% rule doesn't even prevent that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:30:06] <jmcarthur>	or the enemy might choose to fight if he thinks he's better off killing your numbers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:30:13] <jmcarthur>	either way, it's a bigger battle than necessary
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:30:15] <jmcarthur>	not small and precise
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:30:54] <jmcarthur>	and in reality, most battles will not be attempts to take over simply due to the uncertainty involved
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:31:05] <jmcarthur>	sending a huge group makes your current planets more vulnerable
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:31:28] <jmcarthur>	so there's so many variables involved already... the 50% rule is almost meaningless
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:31:55] <jhchrist>	so, on the technical side, how is this being set up? are we doing blocking polling of all of the ais asking for moves each turn, or are we just listening, and runningn a clock and whenever a request makes it to the server, thats the turn when it gets executed?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:32:15] <jmcarthur>	i'd rather do blocking, personally
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:32:47] <jhchrist>	agreed, but I wasn't sure if there was some real-time aspect that was appealing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:06] <jmcarthur>	streaming data and commands just adds more variables that we can't control with our AI
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:13] <jmcarthur>	unfair IPC, for example
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:26] <jmcarthur>	what if one bot receives data faster than the other?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:41] <jmcarthur>	plus having to maintain the state of the game (assuming we send deltas instead of states)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:47] <jmcarthur>	things would just get out of sync
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:54] <pgpaskar>	You know what'd be nice
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:33:58] <jhchrist>	pie
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:02] <pgpaskar>	If you could have like a central pool of information
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:02] <jhchrist>	pie would be nice
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:03] <jmcarthur>	bacon
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:06] <pgpaskar>	And just have those seeking from it
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:08] <pgpaskar>	Ugh why do I bother
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:19] <jhchrist>	central pool? wha?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:20] <jmcarthur>	heh
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:34:37] <jhchrist>	you mean have the server keep records?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:36:48] <jhchrist>	there really shouldnt be that much data to pass to the client -- planet:{owner,rate,ships}, planet<->,planet edge:[{distance,ships{owner,direction,turns_left}}]
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:01] <jmcarthur>	even less than that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:07] <jhchrist>	true
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:10] <jhchrist>	since some things dont change
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:12] <jmcarthur>	if you just do deltas all you have to do is send the commands
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:33] <jhchrist>	well, theres the added ovedrhead of writing the delta tracking for each starter package
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:36] <jmcarthur>	<source> <destination> <number>
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:46] <jmcarthur>	right, but that's not a big deal
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:37:55] <jhchrist>	mmmaybe
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:38:02] <jhchrist>	we can nbe lazy
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:38:05] <jmcarthur>	i bet that would still be simpler than writing a parser for a more complex protocol in each package
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:38:24] <jhchrist>	well, we'll have to give the data to the AI at the start anyways
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:38:37] <jhchrist>	all that gets left out is ships in motion
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:38:45] <jmcarthur>	right
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:38:49] <jmcarthur>	it's different data entirely
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:39:20] <jmcarthur>	it's the difference between map data and commands, is all
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:39:24] <jhchrist>	not entirely, we'd have to process ownership changes
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:39:46] <jmcarthur>	i don't think that should be so difficult to just do in the AI
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:40:25] <jmcarthur>	one of my biggest beefs with the tron contest was that i had to parse the entire map every turn just to get the opponent's move
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:40:48] <jmcarthur>	i never refresh my state from scratch
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:40:51] <jmcarthur>	*refreshed
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:40:52] <jhchrist>	well, it was a tradeoff w.r.t having to keep extra state
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:41:30] <jmcarthur>	i had to keep the state either way
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:41:35] <jmcarthur>	since i used running computations
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:41:44] <jhchrist>	right, but that wasn't ours to maintain :P
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:42:24] <jhchrist>	if it doesn't look too onerous, I agree, reading deltas is fine
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:42:53] <jhchrist>	I just don't want to end up reimplementing the game engine in each starter package
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:43:13] <jmcarthur>	i just don't think the game engine would be complicated enough that we'd rather write more complex parsing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:43:36] <jhchrist>	but my point was that the parser would be trivial to extend
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:43:44] <jhchrist>	just add ships in motion to each edge
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:45:01] <jhchrist>	we should look at something like yaml or json and see how many languages have libraries for them -- it would make parsing (deltas or no) easier
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:46:11] <jmcarthur>	i think json is likely to have better support, of the two
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:46:50] <jhchrist>	probably: imo yaml is nicer, but json is simpler to parse for languages w/o libs
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:46:53] <jmcarthur>	but really... we shouldn't need anything like that
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:47:13] <jmcarthur>	yaml and json are great for protocol that will change over time
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:47:16] <jmcarthur>	*protocols
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:47:35] <jmcarthur>	whatever though
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:47:45] <jmcarthur>	we're bikeshedding
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:47:53] <jhchrist>	actually yaml seems to have good set of libs
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [21:49:09] <jhchrist>	but json is still broader

[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:45:44] <jeff_cameron>	So looks like people are getting pretty pumped about Galcon.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:46:52] <jeff_cameron>	I was thinking about Poker while I was playing pool just now. Poker I think is too complicated, even if we strip it down to just heads-up limit hold 'em.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:47:41] <jeff_cameron>	What is still appealing to me is the "find your way out of a maze" problem. This one is really good, because the instruction set is really small: {N, E, S, W} is all.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:48:07] <jeff_cameron>	Your program parses the map on stdin, and outputs a single character to stdout to say which was it wants to move.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:48:36] <jhchrist>	does that lack some of the competitive spirit that we had with tron?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:48:51] <jhchrist>	I mean, you're not really playing against anyone
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:49:10] <jhchrist>	theres no out-thinking or out-planning involved
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:49:16] <jeff_cameron>	We would use a scoring/ranking function that ranks you based on how efficiently you find your way out.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:49:31] <jeff_cameron>	I see what you mean, though. It's a one-player problem.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:50:36] <jeff_cameron>	I am just thinking about the number one determinant of participation: simplicity.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:51:06] <jeff_cameron>	If we go with Galcon, even though it's simple, it's not nearly as simple as Tron.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:51:53] <jhchrist>	that might be good, though -- it might mean that winning has less to do with building a big tree in a fast language
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:52:34] <pgpaskar>	jeff_cameron
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:52:41] <pgpaskar>	What about symmetrical quadrant maps
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:52:46] <pgpaskar>	with the 'prize' in the center
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:52:54] <pgpaskar>	Same rules of only seeing 1 space infront of you.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:53:13] <jeff_cameron>	So two players race to get to the goal first?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:53:15] <pgpaskar>	Yeah.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:53:21] <pgpaskar>	Or more.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:53:38] <jeff_cameron>	I was thinking that. It actually generalizes. You can have many goal spaces. Whoever collects the most wins.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:54:01] <jeff_cameron>	Consider it a maze with coins in it. Whoever finds the most coins wins.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:54:21] <pgpaskar>	Would you tell them where the coins are and have hem traverse the maze to get there?
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:54:35] <jeff_cameron>	Nah.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:56:03] <jeff_cameron>	Another variants is knocking off this flash game: http://www.sploder.com/games/members/neal/play/the-corn-maze/
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:56:31] <jeff_cameron>	It's a maze with a "coin" on each grid space. Your score is how many coins you manage to pick up in a certain fixed time.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:56:41] <pgpaskar>	Oh so basically backtrack the least
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:57:00] <pgpaskar>	Similar to the tron challenge
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:57:07] <pgpaskar>	Finding the longest non-repeating path
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:57:08] <pgpaskar>	:p
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [22:57:16] <pgpaskar>	(when you're separated from your oponent)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:00:14] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah, and you can't see the whole map.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:00:57] <jeff_cameron>	I think a simpler visibility rule in a maze is that you get to see (and keep) map data in all four directions from any space you've ever occupied.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:01:05] <jeff_cameron>	So it's like you're carrying a lamp, rather than a flashlight.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:02:12] <jmcarthur>	i'm confused about where the AI is in the find you way out of a maze game
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:03:08] <jmcarthur>	you either get lucky or you don't. there's not really an intelligent way to "guess" which way is the best way
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:03:27] <jhchrist>	I have to agree -- not sure about an AI for maze finding.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:03:31] <jmcarthur>	i thought tron was too simple, personally
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:03:50] <jmcarthur>	its simplicity led to most people having the exact same strategies
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:04:40] <jmcarthur>	i mean, i like that it had simple commands and all, but starter packs largely alleviate that kind of things anyway
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:04:45] <jmcarthur>	*kind of thing
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:05:43] <jmcarthur>	and i also want to feel like i actually solved a difficult problem, not just like i shaved some nanoseconds off a preexisting path finding algorithm or tree pruning algorithm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:06:06] <jeff_cameron>	Here are three algorithms for this problem. None of these algorithms even use information outside the space where they're currently standing. It's a hugely deep problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:06:40] <jeff_cameron>	Think of what you could do by using information from other parts of the map and such.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:06:49] <jeff_cameron>	There's no end to how complicated and efficient it can get.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:08:25] <jmcarthur>	but this is just coming up with an algorithm. i would hardly call it AI in the least
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:08:49] <jhchrist>	Additionally, maybe its just me, but this problem seems kind of, well, boring
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:08:55] <jmcarthur>	me too
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:09:19] <jhchrist>	I'm sure there are people for whom this is fascinating, but a maze contest might not bring in the numbers
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:10:52] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:16:11] <jeff_cameron>	We definitely want to avoid boring problems.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:16:14] <jeff_cameron>	So that one's out.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:27:29] Join	amriedle has joined this channel (~amriedle@CPE0013f7b7095c-CM0013f7b70958.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com).
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:27:37] <amriedle>	there we go
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:27:46] <jeff_cameron>	Hey Alex.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:27:50] <jeff_cameron>	We're trying to pick a game.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:27:52] <amriedle>	hows it going
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:28:11] <jeff_cameron>	http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/GameIdeas for some ideas. We're also considering Galcon.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:28:28] <jeff_cameron>	Got some poll results from Reddit people here: jpcameron.com/blog
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:28:55] <amriedle>	galcon is interesting, but possible too much data :S
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:31:52] <jeff_cameron>	This is my main worry.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:32:00] <jeff_cameron>	We've got some good ideas for stripping it down, though.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:33:05] <amstan_>	amriedle: yo
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:33:09] Nick	You are now known as amstan.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:33:10] <amriedle>	like you would first have to strip planet movement, continous, and also maybe only given them 'times' or 'distances'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:33:22] <amriedle>	(of their opponents move)
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:33:30] <amriedle>	hi amstan
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:37:29] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah that's the basic idea.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:05] 	 * pgpaskar slaps amriedle
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:12] 	 * pgpaskar sprouts tenticals
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:14] <pgpaskar>	bruhrhauhauha!
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:25] <pgpaskar>	And this is how bored I am
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:39] <jeff_cameron>	I am randomly surfing flash games looking for inspiration.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:44] <jeff_cameron>	Although Galcon is good.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:40:52] <pgpaskar>	I'm watching starcraft on youtube :\
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:41:12] <amriedle>	ya i made a ripoff of galcon in highschool lol
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:43:13] <pgpaskar>	I made a rip off of a similar game but with different mechanics
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:00] <amriedle>	i thought youtube felt funny
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:04] <pgpaskar>	It was lame because my silly teacher didn't let me submit it for our 'final project' because I started on it 'too early'
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:06] <amriedle>	they are currently rolling out updates
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:11] <pgpaskar>	Yup.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:14] <amriedle>	and not quite there yet
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:18] <pgpaskar>	Yup.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:44:31] <pgpaskar>	Flash still disappoints.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:49:29] <jeff_cameron>	The more I think about it the more appealing something like RoboCode would be.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:49:42] <jeff_cameron>	Except it would be our own knockoff that supports all languages... not just Java.
[Thursday 29 April 2010] [23:49:59] <jeff_cameron>	Basically just Tank Wars on a continuous 2D map.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:05:00] <amriedle>	i wonder if there is some weird variation of quick draw we could do
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:06:05] <jeff_cameron>	What is quick draw?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:06:39] <amriedle>	like cowboys
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:07:05] <amriedle>	stand back to back, walk 10 steps, turn and shoot
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:08:19] <jeff_cameron>	I think computers would be really good at that.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:10:42] <amriedle>	hence weird variation :P
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:12:01] <jeff_cameron>	What about Go? Could we actually do this?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:12:31] <jeff_cameron>	It's pretty nice, because transmitting the board is easy, and transmitting a move is easy. Just send "x y\n" on stdout.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:12:48] <jeff_cameron>	Are there any semi-decent trivial strategies that don't totally suck?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:15:07] <amriedle>	hmmm
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:17:19] <jeff_cameron>	MIT runs their BattleCode competition. You basically program an AI for one agent in an RTS. Then a bunch of your agents go to battle with a bunch of someone else's agents.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:21:03] <jmcarthur>	the best Go AIs are just tree pruning
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:21:39] <jmcarthur>	UCT, actually... the algorithm i used in my tron bot
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:22:01] <jmcarthur>	correction: the algorithm i used *inappropriately* in my tron bot
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:23:41] <jeff_cameron>	What does uct stand for?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:24:23] <jeff_cameron>	There is a hell of a lot of information about Go strategy out there, which is a big plus.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:24:48] <jeff_cameron>	What I want to see is if I can come up with two or three strategies that can be coded in ten lines or less.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:25:14] <jeff_cameron>	I guess here are some:
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:25:21] <jeff_cameron>	(1) Select a random empty space.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:25:28] <amriedle>	whoa im tired, im off to bed i will talk tomorrow *yawns*
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:25:39] <jeff_cameron>	Later Alex.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:25:47] <jeff_cameron>	Alex, are you on campus this upcoming term?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:26:03] <jeff_cameron>	(2) Select a random empty space that is adjacent to an existing stone.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:26:26] Quit	amriedle has left this server (Quit: Lost terminal).
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:26:44] <jeff_cameron>	(3) Select a random empty space that is next to a maximum number of your own stones.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:27:53] <jeff_cameron>	Here are some basic strategies for raw beginners: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Go/Strategy#Strategy_for_Raw_Beginners_.2830_kyu_-_21_kyu.29
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:28:19] <pgpaskar>	argh I have my first day @ coop job this monday ~.~
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:28:30] <pgpaskar>	I dont even know what to do this is basically my first real job
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:29:06] 	 * pgpaskar slaps amstan
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:29:08] <pgpaskar>	What job did you take!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:31:32] <amstan>	pgpaskar: yeah.. i couldn't get any
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:31:36] <amstan>	i'm just stuck at home
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:31:51] <pgpaskar>	What? I thought you got offers ;_;
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:32:18] <amstan>	yeah, facebook said the there was not enough time for a US visa, and google turned out to be full at montreal
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:32:42] <pgpaskar>	argh
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:32:46] <pgpaskar>	Thats unfortunate :\
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:32:49] <amstan>	yeah
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:32:50] <amstan>	oh well
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:32:53] <amstan>	free summer..
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:33:22] <amstan>	i get to do some website/inventory system for this one electonics company in hamilton
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:33:31] <amstan>	but that should not take more than 2 weeks
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:34:15] <jeff_cameron>	Oh amstan, that means you're free to work on the contest 24/7! :-)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:34:53] <jeff_cameron>	Oh shit. Apparently mid-level Go players play games using all white stones to improve their ability to remember board positions.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:35:10] <jeff_cameron>	That would be so intense. Holy shit. I can't even imagine how badass that is.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:37:20] <jeff_cameron>	Damn. Go might be a pretty decent game for this competition. There are a million simple little strategies.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:38:45] <pgpaskar>	jeff_cameron have you seen blind tetris
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:38:48] <pgpaskar>	look it up on youtube
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:38:50] <pgpaskar>	its insane
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:43:28] <pgpaskar>	blarg
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:46:40] <jeff_cameron>	Oh fuuuuck.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:46:42] <jeff_cameron>	Damn.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:46:48] <jeff_cameron>	That is some advanced shit.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:52:06] <jeff_cameron>	Maybe we could restrict it to 9x9 Go.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:52:40] <jeff_cameron>	That would make the games go at least 5 times faster.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:54:23] <pgpaskar>	if we do go I'm totally using another cheap table/css trick for the visualizer
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:57:30] <amstan>	pgpaskar: yes, but go is not inside a grid, is at the line intersections
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:57:53] <pgpaskar>	Oh no it will be inside the grids
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:58:13] <pgpaskar>	Bordlerless but with a cheap background image trick
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:58:26] <pgpaskar>	The actual cells will have the borders running through the center
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:58:27] <amstan>	woot, just finished updating my server: Linux server.hypertriangle.com 2.6.32-21-generic-pae #32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 09:39:35 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:58:36] <amstan>	pgpaskar: ok.. that's messed up
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:58:56] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Friday 30 April 2010] [00:59:15] <pgpaskar>	does firefox even support canvas yet?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:00:33] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah, the CSS table trick will work just fine.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:00:51] <jeff_cameron>	Just have three different background images: empty, black, and white.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:01:34] <amstan>	oh.. that works
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:01:57] <amstan>	visualizr
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:02:09] <pgpaskar>	needs the backwards russian R
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:02:10] <pgpaskar>	ftw
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:02:28] <amstan>	pgpaskar: lol..
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:02:38] <amstan>	that can only remind me of accoun
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:01] <jeff_cameron>	We should name some really important public-facing component of the contest after Accoun.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:21] <amstan>	of course
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:22] <amstan>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:32] <amstan>	the forum and site linking system
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:36] <amstan>	name it Accoun
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:38] <jeff_cameron>	Or if we just go through all the HTML and make sure that we always mis-spell account and username as accoun and usernam. People will be baffled.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:44] <amstan>	yes, that too
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:03:52] <pgpaskar>	"...The complaints department is currently closed. Please check back regularly as we may open Accoun registration again. Thanks"
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:02] <jeff_cameron>	hahaha
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:22] Error	name: Unknown command.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:26] Nick	You are now known as Accoun.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:30] <pgpaskar>	arg
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:30] <jeff_cameron>	Oh no.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:32] Error	name: Unknown command.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:36] Nick	You are now known as amstan.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:36] <amstan>	darn
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:39] <amstan>	it's not registered
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:04:56] <amstan>	if you take someone's registered nick, it says who's it registered to
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:05:05] <pgpaskar>	You could also just ask nickserv.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:05:09] <jeff_cameron>	What do you guys think about having 9x9 Go be the game?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:05:55] <pgpaskar>	I'm down with that. Board games are cool challenges. It's good to use something that people probably know something about or can learn to play as a human pretty easily
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:06:00] <pgpaskar>	Unlike lamp maze challenge
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:06:03] <jeff_cameron>	I guess I could do some experiments to see if I can produce five meaningfully different trivial strategies.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:06:50] <jeff_cameron>	I can make an engine, and five simple bots, and see if they consistently beat each other in some predictable way. Also, we can look at the games, and see if they're interesting.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:07:45] <jeff_cameron>	I think it would be sick to have a graphical Java client that people can use to play against their Go bots, to play Go bots against one another, or to play tournaments between many Go bots.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:08:25] <jeff_cameron>	Maybe that's a bit ambitious. Maybe just start by creating a graphical Java program that displays an already-played game from a text file.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:08:33] <jmcarthur>	i'm just not interested in games that have been extremely researched already
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:08:57] <amstan>	yeah, i agree, go is pretty boring
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:09:06] <amstan>	and someone with lots of research will come in and own
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:09:09] <jmcarthur>	it's not even about how boring it is
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:09:17] <jmcarthur>	it's about who can read the most papers
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:09:28] <jmcarthur>	lame
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:09:50] <pgpaskar>	lol, if you're the kind of person who's willing to throw fun right out the window to win
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:09:54] <pgpaskar>	this is def. the wrong contest for you ;)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:10:10] <pgpaskar>	But I guess I have to agree, already researched games have that thing to them
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:10:19] <pgpaskar>	Where everyone tries to impliment the best existing algorithm
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:10:26] <jeff_cameron>	To me, I am mostly concerned with how much fun it will be to the bottom-ranked 500 people, rather than the top 100.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:10:27] <pgpaskar>	Kind of like Greenberg for RPS and Minimax for tron
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:11:04] <pgpaskar>	Oh jeff btw, I think it would be a decent idea to perhaps have tiers for this one like
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:11:20] <pgpaskar>	Like a highschool bracket and univeristy bracket maybe
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:11:28] <jeff_cameron>	It worries me that someone could enter an existing strong open source program. However, we could prevent this fairly easily by looking for a few substrings in their code.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:12:08] <jeff_cameron>	I remember in the RPS contest I had two brackets: first-year and everyone-else.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:12:12] <pgpaskar>	I'm not sure how that would be authenticated though, because I feel that some people who are genuinely trying but don't have the skill to compete with, say, the guy wrote Chess AI's previously also want to have a somewhat competative bracket =]
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:12:19] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: you want to prohibit the reuse of already made up engines?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:12:39] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: yes, I think so.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:13:00] <amstan>	kind of hard to enforce
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:13:05] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: I know some cheap motherfucker who just copied existing source and won one of the previous contests :-P
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:13:11] <pgpaskar>	Lol.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:13:24] <amstan>	lol..
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:13:29] <amstan>	hey.. i wasn't the only one!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:13:56] <jeff_cameron>	No but seriously. We can deter 90% of the problems in this respect just by looking for, say, 20 randomly selected substrings from common open source programs. If we get 10 matches, we reject the entry.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:18] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: they can just change all variable names and resubmit
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:21] <pgpaskar>	That just encourages people to try to cheat the system :\
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:28] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah, for sure.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:44] <amstan>	we need something that does a diff with previos rejected entries
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:46] <jeff_cameron>	I claim that a fairly simple approach could be quite successful, since they don't know which segments we're looking for.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:56] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: but.. it's open source
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:14:56] <amstan>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:04] <jeff_cameron>	Oh yeah./
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:07] <pgpaskar>	Oh crap! Owned!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:08] <jeff_cameron>	Faaaack.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:22] <pgpaskar>	Remember what you learned about security through obscurity... :]
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:29] <jeff_cameron>	*sigh*
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:37] <amstan>	hey.. i never liked that, jeff keeps using it tohugh
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:39] <amstan>	though*
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:50] <pgpaskar>	Anywho
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:59] <amstan>	i just think that we need to get a challenge that's original
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:15:59] <jeff_cameron>	Okay, I still claim there will be a good way. We'll store the segments in rot13 or some shit. It just has to be enough to deflect the 95% of least sophisticated people.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:16:00] <pgpaskar>	What you could do is change a few rules of Go so those bots don't apply
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:16:24] <jeff_cameron>	Now if someone wants to take an existing strong program and translate it completely into python in order to avoid getting detected, I claim that's decently legitimate.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:16:38] <jeff_cameron>	What we want to deter is people just copying code, or copying code with minimal changes.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:16:40] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: if they want first.. they would rather do that rot13 cracking than write a go engine from scratch
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:17:43] <jeff_cameron>	There's gotta be something we can do to detect frauds with high reliability.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:05] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: also..
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:23] <amstan>	let's say the creators of the best go engine so far wants to compete in this contest
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:27] <amstan>	we can't filter his entry out
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:30] <amstan>	because he made it..
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:37] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:38] <amstan>	see the problem?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:18:39] <jeff_cameron>	What if we choose substrings that are really difficult to rewrite? That could be a good deterrent. We could also do some sort of spot checking in the top ten. I'm pretty sure it's do-able.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:12] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: yeah I see the problem. If he comes along, we'll have a little chat in the forums or IRC channel and sort out an exception.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:37] <pgpaskar>	I still kind of think adjusting a few of the core rules or looking for a Go variant is a better solution
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:46] <amstan>	jeff_cameron: what if someone was a contributor to such a go engine
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:51] <pgpaskar>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_variants
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:53] <amstan>	but they didn't make it 100%
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:54] <pgpaskar>	whooooo a wikipedia article
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:19:56] <pgpaskar>	¦]
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:22:02] <jeff_cameron>	Hmmm interesting.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:22:58] <jeff_cameron>	We can look at it as a disadvantage that there is prior research on Go, or we can look at it as a positive. Let's face it. Out of 10,000 contestants, 9,995 are probably not going to be doing any novel research. So who cares? It's about the learning and the fun.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:23:24] <jeff_cameron>	It means that when a new contestant types "go strategy" into Google, he gets thousands of articles.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:24:09] <amstan>	i don't think it's as attracting as something like tron is
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:24:24] <jmcarthur>	i don't find that fun. i find translating research papers into working code to be tedious
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:24:24] <amstan>	the interesting thing about tron was that it tricked you in thinking it was simple
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:24:27] <jeff_cameron>	Even the power users will appreciate having a wealth of papers and advanced algorithms to play with.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:24:47] <jeff_cameron>	Except jmcarthur, haha.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:25:24] <jeff_cameron>	amstan: you're right. Games that appear to be simple but are really deep are perfect. Games that are trivial to learn, but hard to master.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:25:35] <jmcarthur>	really though. i just like writing glue code at work. you have a concrete task laid out in front of you and you write it. that's not challenging. that's just testing your typing speed
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:25:41] <jmcarthur>	*it's just like
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:25:59] <pgpaskar>	clearly you've never 'written glue code' for php->ruby
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:26:08] <pgpaskar>	that shit is not testing anything about your typing other than your endurance
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:26:14] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: that sounds like research :P
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:26:33] <jmcarthur>	but not fun research
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:27:26] <jeff_cameron>	jmcarthur where do you work, out of curiosity?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:27:46] <jmcarthur>	well, i lied, i actually do research at work
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:27:48] <jmcarthur>	http://pikewerks.com/
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:27:51] <pgpaskar>	Anywho its difficult to find one of these games that has the allure of simplicity, freshness of something modern and the popularity to spark interest
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:29:26] <jmcarthur>	huh, our research page broke
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:29:37] 	 * jmcarthur sends somebody an email
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:08] <jmcarthur>	oh, lots of pages broke!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:25] <jeff_cameron>	haha
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:25] <jmcarthur>	:(
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:29] <jeff_cameron>	Daaaamn.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:36] <jeff_cameron>	The pages at my old work never go down.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:40] <jeff_cameron>	:-)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:30:58] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah I am totally stuck to find a perfect game.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:18] <jeff_cameron>	Tron was a huge success, and I am nervous about picking a new game. I keep comparing back to Tron.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:24] 	 * jmcarthur whispers "galcon"
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:25] <amstan>	yeah... lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:27] <pgpaskar>	I say we play go but give the units a tech tree and upgrades and a resource gathering mechanic and fog of war!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:33] <pgpaskar>	Blarrrrgh! (I'm very tired ~.~)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:35] <jmcarthur>	pgpaskar: :o
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:38] <amstan>	and we can't have tron because a1k0n would just own again
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:42] Quit	jhchrist has left this server (Remote host closed the connection).
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:31:54] Join	jhchrist has joined this channel (~jhchrist@69-165-131-73.dsl.teksavvy.com).
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:10] <jeff_cameron>	I think we can run Tron again. But I want to wait until we're closed to the new Tron movie coming out.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:14] <jeff_cameron>	Free advertising w00t.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:18] <pgpaskar>	lmao
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:18] <jmcarthur>	heh
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:28] <pgpaskar>	Get them to sponsor it! Whoopie
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:28] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:32:41] <amstan>	pgpaskar: who? MPAA?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:33:08] <jhchrist>	we could always modify tron to make it more interesting
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:33:20] <jhchrist>	instead of just running the same thing again
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:33:33] <jhchrist>	that way old submissions won't automatically shoot to the top
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:33:59] <jmcarthur>	hey my work web site works again!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:12] <pgpaskar>	The shit could hit the fan and you could play without borders
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:16] <pgpaskar>	Spherical tron!
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:32] <jhchrist>	wrap around?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:33] <pgpaskar>	Imagine, the entire map is actually a sphere =]
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:40] <amstan>	pgpaskar, jeff_cameron: can you guys ssh to csclub alright?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:47] <pgpaskar>	nope
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:34:53] <jmcarthur>	3 vs 3 tron
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:01] <amstan>	pgpaskar: darn it
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:02] <pgpaskar>	caffeine seems to be down again
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:06] <jmcarthur>	like the movie
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:09] <amstan>	pgpaskar: everything is down again
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:09] <amstan>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:13] <pgpaskar>	I dont even understand why it has so much downtime
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:20] <jhchrist>	we could make the tails fade...
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:26] <pgpaskar>	Something is def. wrong with that machine
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:48] <amstan>	pgpaskar: it's not caffeine, it's all the servers, i can't ssh to any other ones either
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:58] <jmcarthur>	have 3 vs 3 tron with tails that taper at the ends and that disappear after a a car dies
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:35:59] <amstan>	however, i have a server running on taurine, it seems to be up still
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:36:06] <jmcarthur>	s/car/bike/
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:36:08] <amstan>	jmcarthur: hmm
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:36:09] <pgpaskar>	The domain routes through caffeine?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:36:11] <jhchrist>	if the tails were to fade, then a lot of the strategies of block off and waste time wouldnt work anymore
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:36:12] <amstan>	yeah, that would be cool
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:36:51] <jhchrist>	you would be forced to actually fight
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:00] <jmcarthur>	it's still 1 vs 1 for AIs, but each AI could control 3 bikes
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:13] <pgpaskar>	But then it doesn't always terminate :\
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:21] <pgpaskar>	Games can go on for a very long time given the right bots playing vs eachother
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:34] <jhchrist>	put a move cap on which makes it a draw
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:36] <pgpaskar>	Unless you pull a bomberman and the walls cave in
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:45] <jmcarthur>	that works
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:49] <jmcarthur>	;)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:52] <amstan>	ok, how about bomberman?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:37:53] <jhchrist>	if you can't pin your opponent in n moves, you're even-ish
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:38:34] <pgpaskar>	But N would have to get really huge as you try to differenciate higher-end algorithms :\
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:38:54] <pgpaskar>	differentiate also
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:39:22] <jmcarthur>	how about multiplayer snake instead? both players try to pick up the most food, tails get longer as they do so, they try to cut each other off, etc.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:39:33] <jmcarthur>	and when all the food is picked up the round is over
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:39:48] <jhchrist>	whoever is the longest wins?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:39:56] <jmcarthur>	if both still live, yes
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:10] <pgpaskar>	That's a cool game actually
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:12] <jhchrist>	sounds good. make sure there is an odd number of food points
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:18] <jmcarthur>	yes
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:27] <jmcarthur>	actually...
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:36] <jeff_cameron>	When you eat food, your tail gets longer. Food spawns randomly. There can be no draws.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:42] <jmcarthur>	if food pops up like it does in snake the game could just continue until somebody dies
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:52] <jeff_cameron>	That would be a SICK game.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:40:57] <jeff_cameron>	We could do that this time, haha.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:41:01] <jeff_cameron>	Two-player snake. For real.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:41:16] <jeff_cameron>	It's Tron with a whole new dimension.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:41:25] <jhchrist>	we could brand it as such
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:41:27] <pgpaskar>	I think I still have my 2 player networked snake game in turing
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:41:27] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:41:31] <jeff_cameron>	And totally breaks the old Tron entries.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:42:08] <jhchrist>	and we get to reuse old website, modify the visualizers
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:43:07] <jmcarthur>	should food spawn truly randomly? or perhaps symmetrically? (food appears in one place and also in the same place on the other side of the map)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:43:43] <jhchrist>	well, given large enough numbers of competitions, randomness shouldn't matter, but doing it symmetrically might mean fewer rounds to make things even
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:43:51] <jmcarthur>	right
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:43:55] <jhchrist>	perhaps food could start out symmetric and then more spawn randomly?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:44:20] <jhchrist>	once they're on the move it won't matter as much
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:44:29] <jmcarthur>	i guess you're right
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:44:53] <jeff_cameron>	Dude check out this page about simple Go heuristics. So bitchin. http://www.andromeda.com/people/ddyer/go/global-eval.html
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:47:19] <pgpaskar>	lmao a bot that learns from its mistake
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:47:24] <pgpaskar>	that would be a hilarious entry
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:48:03] <pgpaskar>	Argh dell why do you tease me with your $200 22" IPS dispalys
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:49:01] <jeff_cameron>	If we do Go, we could consider making the TM accept connections from outside, so people can run their bots on bigger badder hardware if they want.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:49:32] <jeff_cameron>	I would love to see a hardware pissing contest between the top entries. That would be ridiculously entertaining.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:52:17] <jhchrist>	so when do we want to have a game chosen by?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:52:18] <pgpaskar>	lol
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:52:24] <pgpaskar>	Multi-core Go engine
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:52:34] <pgpaskar>	vs Northbot (Go Edition!)
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:54:31] <jhchrist>	I'm not sure that having a bigger processor is the goal of the tournament, though
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:54:52] <jhchrist>	brute force on a fast computer shouldn't win
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:55:17] <jhchrist>	as entertaining as it would be
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:55:24] <pgpaskar>	I kind of like the snakes idea
[Friday 30 April 2010] [01:56:01] <jhchrist>	as do I -- we have a couple of new suggestions: poker, galcon, tron++. should we do another vote?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:00:44] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah a new vote might be a good idea.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:01:30] <pgpaskar>	I think internet radio has probably been my best investment for computer-related purchased
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:01:32] <pgpaskar>	purchases *
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:01:40] <pgpaskar>	That's sad when you think about it :[
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:01:41] <jeff_cameron>	We got 1000 responses to the first one, we should be able to get a decent sample size on this new one.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:01:57] <jeff_cameron>	You can pay for internet radio?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:02:27] <pgpaskar>	Yeah I pay for di.fm
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:02:31] <jhchrist>	you want to pay for internet radio?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:02:42] <jhchrist>	dude, you can get that stuff for free, you know
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:02:44] <jeff_cameron>	You know that di.fm is free, yeah?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:02:46] <jhchrist>	*wink*
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:02:56] <pgpaskar>	Yeah I know
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:03:03] <pgpaskar>	I listened to 96k di.fm for the longest time
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:03:15] <jeff_cameron>	Is that the highest quality they're publishing now?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:03:16] <pgpaskar>	Then I discovered the hole in my wallet that is audio equipment
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:03:50] <pgpaskar>	Yup, 256k mp3 stream
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:03:58] <jeff_cameron>	Back in 2005, I listened to 128-bit DI.fm all the time. That was high back then. I just assumed they would keep publishing at reasonable quality for free.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:04:06] <pgpaskar>	Naw so did I
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:04:11] <pgpaskar>	They pumped the free down to 96k
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:04:16] <pgpaskar>	And pushed the pay to 256k
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:04:26] <jeff_cameron>	Makes sense to a degree.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:04:39] <jeff_cameron>	We should just start out own radio station. We are the internet in Canada.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:12] <pgpaskar>	Apparently they use the Xing encoder for the low quality stream
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:24] <pgpaskar>	Or so one of their staff has said
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:32] <jeff_cameron>	Is that good or bad?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:37] <pgpaskar>	It's shocking because their 96k stream is really good as far as 96k goes
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:38] <jeff_cameron>	Or is it up for debate?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:40] <pgpaskar>	:|
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:05:52] <pgpaskar>	The Xing encoder is dubbed the 'worst possible encoder to use'
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:01] <jeff_cameron>	Why would they use it then?
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:01] <jhchrist>	hrm... not a lot of selection there
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:08] <jeff_cameron>	Presumably they have studied this issue.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:15] <pgpaskar>	jhchrist for mainstream music, sky.fm is the sister site
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:20] <pgpaskar>	This is weird techno music
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:23] <jhchrist>	ah
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:28] <jeff_cameron>	di.fm is all you need. Fuck sky FM.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:34] <pgpaskar>	Not true
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:38] <pgpaskar>	New Age is a great channel for studying

[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:06:52] <pgpaskar>	Trance? Blergh
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:07:03] <jeff_cameron>	Okay, all techno/electronic.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:07:12] <pgpaskar>	Hardbass is where its at.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:07:15] <jhchrist>	oh man -- classic rap? I'm old...
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:07:35] <jeff_cameron>	So, I still don't get why you'd pay for di.fm. There are about five billion identical stations that broadcast in 256k for free.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:08:05] <pgpaskar>	di.fm has consistently good live sets
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:08:12] <jeff_cameron>	This is true.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:08:26] <jeff_cameron>	They have good variety from what I remember, as well.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:08:48] <pgpaskar>	They also have some tracks and mixes that I can't even find anywhere to buy at all, it's insane where they find this stuff
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:09:02] <pgpaskar>	I used to have this winamp bookmark list of tracks I REALLY wanted or mixes that I couldn't find anywhere
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:09:10] <pgpaskar>	List got so huge I eventually just deleted it out of spite
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:09:27] <jeff_cameron>	Yeah I hate it when I can't find tracks that I hear on the radio.
[Friday 30 April 2010] [02:09:49] <jeff_cameron>	If anyone can get me a record with "Ti Prosto Klass" by "Soyuz Elektro Klub" I would be eternally grateful.

[Friday 30 April 2010] [16:58:40] <jmcarthur>	could set a soft limit of 1 second and a hard limit of 1.1 seconds or something. programmers could either ignore the SIGXCPU from the soft limit (which kills the process by default) or catch the signal and wraps things up quickly before the hard limit comes
[Friday 30 April 2010] [16:59:14] <jmcarthur>	and the hard limit unconditionally kills the process
[Friday 30 April 2010] [16:59:30] <jmcarthur>	hmm...
[Friday 30 April 2010] [16:59:40] <jmcarthur>	but i don't know about reseting it between turns
[Friday 30 April 2010] [17:00:47] <jmcarthur>	like, you could set the limits for the first turn by setting it in a process and then execing the AI, but for later turns it seems that it would be out of the supervisor's control
[Friday 30 April 2010] [17:05:10] <jmcarthur>	ah, you can use sysctl to control the resources of other processes. excellent
[Friday 30 April 2010] [17:06:59] <jmcarthur>	sysctl is a fun function.....
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:22:22] <amstan>	jmcarthur: that sounds very nice
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:23:09] <jmcarthur>	i looked at sysctl a little more after i said all that. i could not find from the documentation exactly how to set the cpu time limit for a given process
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:23:16] <jmcarthur>	but i gave up fairly soon too, since i was at work
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:28:50] <jmcarthur>	hmm... i think there might be a way to just use setrlimit though... if my understand it correct, there could be a supervisor process for each AI that calls setrlimit and forks and execs the AI. it then plays intermediary between the server and the AI, updating the cpu time limit as it goes. if the time limit is exceeded then both the supervisor and the AI are killed
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:29:20] <jmcarthur>	and the AI could be prevented from updating the limit itself using ptrace
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:29:38] <jmcarthur>	*if my understanding is correct
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:30:04] <jmcarthur>	by "playing intermediary" i mean acting as a proxy
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:30:19] <jmcarthur>	although that may not be strictly necessary. i don't know
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:30:48] <jmcarthur>	the key point is that each AI process has its own parent process which controls the resources available to it
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:33:17] <jmcarthur>	the supervisor would steal a small amount of cpu time from the AI, probably
[Friday 30 April 2010] [20:33:57] <jmcarthur>	oh, and the supervisor should also be responsible for "forwarding" SIGXCPU to the AI

[Saturday 01 May 2010] [23:45:51] <jeff_cameron>	I did not manage to complete the experiments with the game of Go today :-(
[Saturday 01 May 2010] [23:46:27] <jeff_cameron>	Spent two hours refactoring the code I had already written, then went off to do some other things.
[Saturday 01 May 2010] [23:46:47] <jeff_cameron>	I gotta really get a move on if I want to launch this contest anytime soon.
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:27:54] <jmcarthur>	jeff_cameron: did you see when i said that the galcon author has offered to write an official version of galcon for bots?
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:28:08] <jmcarthur>	he spotted the reddit thread and mentioned it
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:28:17] <jeff_cameron>	Ohhhh really?
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:28:19] <jmcarthur>	yup
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:28:30] <jeff_cameron>	I should get in touch with him. Did he leave any contact info?

[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:28:40] <jmcarthur>	no, he didn't, but there's the comment
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:29:39] <jeff_cameron>	What's the protocol there. Is it kosher for me to reply to that with "Hey! Organizer of the Google AI Challenge here. Email me cameron.jp@gmail.com."
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [00:30:06] <jmcarthur>	probably should do this  http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=philhassey

[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:54:29] <amriedle>	as long as your not homosexual bots im all good.
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:54:56] <jmcarthur>	you would have reason to fear even if we were homosexual bots
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:55:04] <jmcarthur>	because we are bots
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:55:04] <amriedle>	...
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:55:37] <jmcarthur>	do you fear homosexual trees?
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:55:53] <amriedle>	no, i just fear homosexual sex bots
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:03] <amriedle>	or maybe its just sex bots in general lol
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:05] <jmcarthur>	oh, homosexual *sex* bots
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:12] <amriedle>	mhmm
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:23] <jmcarthur>	is a sex machine the same as a sex bot? because i am the former
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:32] 	 * amriedle runs away
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:42] <amstan>	so
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:56:51] <amstan>	i made a python bot a few weeks ago
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:02] <amstan>	named hyperwulf
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:09] <amstan>	since i also own the domain, hyperwulf.com
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:16] <amstan>	it was supposed to be a beowulf cluster
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:17] <amstan>	anyway..
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:27] <amstan>	it turned out that one of the users in the chan was a furry
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:38] <amstan>	so yeah..
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:53] <amstan>	bad idea to make it howl at the moon every few hours randomly
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:57:57] <jmcarthur>	lol
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:58:21] <jmcarthur>	i was roomed with two furries in college
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:58:33] <jmcarthur>	they... weren't as weird as you might expect
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:59:05] <jmcarthur>	some of their friends we weirder though
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:59:17] <jmcarthur>	so i guess i was just lucky they weren't their friends
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:59:34] <amriedle>	hahaha
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:59:34] <jmpespxoreax>	damnit, I saw the activity light and hoped for some AI talk
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:59:37] <jmpespxoreax>	:P
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [22:59:38] <amriedle>	this is so true
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:00:00] <amstan>	yeah, perhaps we should talk less about furries
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:00:00] <amstan>	lol
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:00:01] <amriedle>	its the day of rest, no AI talk :P
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:00:42] <amstan>	oh wait.. greghaynes knows the bot and the furry individual
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:00:47] <jmcarthur>	well i started writing a simple galcon simulator yesterday for kicks, but i didn't continue it today, so not much has been done
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:13] <jmcarthur>	who is the furry individual?
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:17] <amriedle>	is this what we have decided on ? (i have not been around for long enough)
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:19] <jmcarthur>	or should that be said?
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:20] <amstan>	jmcarthur: galcon would be interesting, idk how it works, but it seems pretty exciting that it's a flash game and that the main dude offered to cooperate with is
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:34] <amriedle>	galcon is a flash game :S
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:37] <jmcarthur>	amstan: well, it's a flash game and also has various machine native versions
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:40] <amriedle>	i thought it was written in pygame
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:43] <jmpespxoreax>	I think Tron should be opened up again, simply to draw people in
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:01:47] <jmcarthur>	amriedle: it's not decided
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:02:06] <amriedle>	jmpespxoreax: maybe fall / december area
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:02:13] <jmcarthur>	amriedle: it has many versions. the flash version is just one
[Sunday 02 May 2010] [23:02:24] <amriedle>	jmcarthur: i started to assume

[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:55:25] <amstan>	perhaps i can work on that in the weekend
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:55:38] <amriedle>	why was i not informed lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:56:35] <amstan>	ok... this is lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:56:42] <amstan>	we need a forum
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:56:48] <amstan>	internat forum
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:56:51] <amstan>	internal*
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:56:56] <amstan>	that should be the priority for now
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:57:26] <amriedle>	forums are for loooosers lo
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:57:39] <amriedle>	news feed + comments == way more pwn :P
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:57:55] <amstan>	umm
[Friday 07 May 2010] [20:58:05] <amstan>	i'm pretty sure they're pretty equivalent
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:00:29] <amriedle>	yes but as history shows, forums dont develop
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:00:32] <amriedle>	news feeds can
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:00:51] <amriedle>	also news feeds actually contain useful information lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:01:10] <amstan>	forums don't develop?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:01:12] <amstan>	how so?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:01:18] <amstan>	what history?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:01:35] <amriedle>	the one in my mind lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:02:16] <amstan>	last contest the forum was pretty popular
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:02:19] <amstan>	and useful
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:02:33] <amriedle>	and in my opinion cluttered hence why i never checked it lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:02:47] <amstan>	I'm planning to link the site user accounts
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:02:51] <amstan>	get more mods
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:03:51] <amriedle>	if we are really upto it, write a simple forum lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:04:14] <amstan>	why? that will make it even worse to organize
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:04:19] <amstan>	not to mention security aspects
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:05:01] <amriedle>	the security aspect can be covered quite easily
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:05:12] <amriedle>	and organize? im not sure what you are eluding to
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:05:12] <amstan>	still..
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:05:19] <amstan>	i'm quite fond of phpbb
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:05:27] <amstan>	organizing the topics i mean
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:06:16] <amriedle>	not any differnt in my opinion
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:07:31] <amriedle>	phorum is kinda interesting
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:07:34] <amriedle>	but still not that nice
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:09:25] <amriedle>	miniBB might not be a bad idea
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:09:39] <amriedle>	cause phpBB is sorta overkill for what we are doing
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:09:40] <amstan>	why do you feel like the forum software must be changed?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:09:49] <amriedle>	no not really
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:03] <amriedle>	it would just be nice to integrate forum into site a little more cleanly
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:18] <amstan>	oh, ic
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:33] <amstan>	well, i can make a theme for it, use the main menu from the site as well
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:37] <amstan>	integrate accounts
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:39] <amriedle>	maybe its just cause i hate when im in a website
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:40] <amriedle>	click and link
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:41] <amstan>	this can be done
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:45] <amriedle>	and it feels like i went off to another website
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:10:52] <amstan>	i have done this before actually
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:11:00] <amriedle>	how much work is it
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:11:04] <amstan>	http://gpc.whitetree.ca/index.php
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:11:07] <amstan>	try the forums
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:11:10] <amstan>	that's phpbb
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:12:01] <amriedle>	its better cause i don't feel like ive dissapeared
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:12:05] <amriedle>	but my question is how much effort
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:12:16] <amstan>	that didn't take long
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:12:20] <amriedle>	and whats the maintainability
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:12:20] <amstan>	it's just 2 files to edit
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:12:41] <amstan>	hmm
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:13:03] <amstan>	i see your point
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:14:29] <amstan>	though, i still think phpbb our best bet
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:14:50] <amstan>	i remember on our slowest days
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:15:00] <amstan>	when the website would take ages to load, the forum was still as fast
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:22:10] <amriedle>	the website was just slow due to database i was pretty sure we figured out
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:22:23] <amriedle>	that is why i started caching
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:23:12] <amriedle>	i think we should start trying to provide a rich website experience
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:23:20] <amriedle>	amp it up a bit you know
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:24:00] <amstan>	yep
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:24:59] <amriedle>	im still thinking about the visualizer, and thinking "this may be the worst idea ever" for JS parsing
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:06] <amriedle>	why was JSON shotdown btw ?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:13] <amstan>	too much data
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:22] <amstan>	didn't you get the emails?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:24] <amriedle>	to much data as in characters?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:29] <amstan>	yeah, apparently
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:47] <amstan>	aren't you in concom?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:48] <amriedle>	im just thinking what is the parse time of the smaller data
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:25:55] <amriedle>	in js ... on bad browsers lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:26:20] <amstan>	parse time on crappy browsers is much less important than bandwidth for our servers
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:26:20] <amstan>	lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:26:27] <amriedle>	lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:26:34] <amriedle>	then why dont we encode
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:26:49] <amriedle>	:P
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:28:02] <amstan>	well.. that's cpu power
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:28:10] <amstan>	you mean compress?
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:28:15] <amriedle>	no
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:28:35] <amriedle>	like use byte level data, instead of character level data :P
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:28:58] <amriedle>	so i guess 'compress' as in by not using all numbers
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:29:03] <amstan>	that'll really cause problems in browsers
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:29:10] <amriedle>	lol
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:29:16] <amstan>	i don't think a lot of the stuff is bitsafe
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:29:29] <amriedle>	very true
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:29:36] <amstan>	though..
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:29:40] <amstan>	base64 encoding
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:30:40] <amriedle>	or you know, use googles protocol buffers
[Friday 07 May 2010] [21:30:45] <amriedle>	but im not sure how good that is
