2011-05-22T00:01:09  <amstan> demerzel: here.. i think i disabled that
2011-05-22T00:03:00  <demerzel> oh your'e fine
2011-05-22T00:03:09  <demerzel> it's the starter package anyway - the pathfinding logic is shitty
2011-05-22T00:03:20  <demerzel> but honestly i didn't expect to put a lot of effort into the starter package haha
2011-05-22T00:03:28  <demerzel> in that sense anwyay
2011-05-22T00:03:59  <demerzel> it basically just goes west but gets stuck idk if i should bother to fix it for the starter package
2011-05-22T00:04:16  <demerzel> i ahve a parallel real bot but it uses a completely different map idea that is quite a bit more advanced with XORs etc
2011-05-22T00:04:21  <demerzel> dno't think i want to put that into the starter one

2011-05-22T01:07:22  <McLeopold> yeah, I said earlier it was bad oop state
2011-05-22T01:07:32  <McLeopold> modifying a global
2011-05-22T01:07:50  <McLeopold> sry it's so late, life gets busy
2011-05-22T01:08:27  <McLeopold> amstan: the api_game_result.php isn't running the manager.py correctly, so mu/sigma don't get updated
2011-05-22T01:08:52  <amstan> my question is why there's so many duplicates in the rankings

2011-05-22T01:09:28  <McLeopold> oh, that's because I'm going to attempt to show current and previous bots until the current bots stabalizes
2011-05-22T01:09:43  <amstan> ok
2011-05-22T01:09:45  <McLeopold> janzert and I had that discussion 2 months ago or so
2011-05-22T01:10:04  <McLeopold> obviously, there's an issue with it right now...
2011-05-22T01:10:11  <amstan> is it just me? or does this page not load? http://hypertriangle.com:13080/profile.php?user=7
2011-05-22T01:10:19  <amstan> any user page for that matter
2011-05-22T01:10:53  <amstan> apache is using 100% cpu
2011-05-22T01:10:57  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-22T01:11:02  <McLeopold> what about sql?
2011-05-22T01:11:32  <amstan> it was fine
2011-05-22T01:12:47  <McLeopold> It looks like you are running games?
2011-05-22T01:13:16  <amstan> yes
2011-05-22T01:13:21  <amstan> i restarted apache
2011-05-22T01:13:46  <amstan> logs/error.log is full of [Sun May 22 01:13:22 2011] [error] [client 192.168.0.1] PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant match_result - assumed 'match_result' in /home/contest/aichallenge/website/api_get_task.php on line 54
2011-05-22T01:14:08  <McLeopold> I was just looking at that
2011-05-22T01:14:16  <amstan> other than that, idk
2011-05-22T01:14:21  <amstan> it was probably an infinite loop in apache
2011-05-22T01:14:24  <amstan> php*
2011-05-22T01:14:27  <amstan> that had to timout
2011-05-22T01:14:54  <amstan> the user pages still take forever to load though
2011-05-22T01:15:38  <McLeopold> it's probably my memcache code turned off
2011-05-22T01:15:56  <amstan> memcached is in htop

2011-05-22T01:18:54  <demerzel> did that one not work?
2011-05-22T01:18:59  <amstan> i have no idea
2011-05-22T01:20:07  <amstan> ok, well, i feel like going to sleep

2011-05-22T01:20:46  <McLeopold> you want me to issue a shutdown later?  does that even help?
2011-05-22T01:20:48  <amstan> demerzel: games are broken?

2011-05-22T14:42:10  <demerzel> i don't remember

2011-05-22T14:42:43  <demerzel> ah so you are clouding yea i can grab you a vps it's only like 20 bucks for a pretty decent one
2011-05-22T14:43:02  <demerzel> actually we might have an extra softlayer node at work
2011-05-22T14:43:06  <demerzel> i'll check on that
2011-05-22T14:43:13  <amstan> what os?
2011-05-22T14:43:20  <demerzel> debian iirc
2011-05-22T14:43:39  <amstan> it should be ubuntu natty, we haven't tested the framework on debian
2011-05-22T14:43:46  <amstan> there's different package names, locations and so on
2011-05-22T14:43:57  <demerzel> ah the vps are ubuntu i think so i'll grab that
2011-05-22T14:44:59  <demerzel> damn they're running a special even
2011-05-22T14:45:06  <demerzel> 2gig mem / 100gb storage?

2011-05-22T16:22:54  <demerzel> well you're about 10 minutes into that one lol
2011-05-22T16:22:54  <amstan> and i think i just fixed it

2011-05-22T17:40:04  <amstan> themes*
2011-05-22T17:40:36  <mcstar> actually i liked that
2011-05-22T17:40:51  <mcstar> no colors, except a nice image with a logo in the header or something
2011-05-22T17:41:47  <mcstar> thaT look like professional, and this green one is sort of cheap-looking
2011-05-22T17:41:54  <mcstar> if you know what i mean
2011-05-22T17:42:21  <mcstar> but the font is nice on the new page
2011-05-22T17:42:27  <mcstar> is it the new ubuntu font?

2011-05-22T18:20:23  <Frontier> amstan: I don't know how much you know about Java, but the default memory limit was at 256 MB for a long time. You can set it with -Xms or something like that
2011-05-22T18:20:40  <amstan> Frontier: how do you make ant do that?
2011-05-22T18:20:41  <Frontier> amstan: you want a link to the 'original' replay?
2011-05-22T18:21:01  <Frontier> is the build process the prooblem?
2011-05-22T18:21:06  <amstan> Frontier: yes
2011-05-22T18:21:09  <amstan> probably more though
2011-05-22T18:21:19  <amstan> i think that java doesn't like the ubuntu vm
2011-05-22T18:21:20  <demerzel> amstan: If you are executing the <java> task in Ant you can add the <jvmarg value="=Xmx256m" /> tag to it.
2011-05-22T18:21:35  <amstan> since it has 1GB of actual ram, but 2GB burst(whatever that means)
2011-05-22T18:21:36  <Frontier> that is strange, I never hat to fiddle with the default setting for anything.
2011-05-22T18:21:37  <amstan> http://pastebin.com/fm3xK8DY
2011-05-22T18:21:43  <Frontier> except for Java servers
2011-05-22T18:22:04  <demerzel> idk wtf 'burst' ram is in thsi case tho
2011-05-22T18:22:16  <demerzel> hopefully the first gig is real ram lol
2011-05-22T18:22:17  <Frontier> maybe disk swap :p

2011-05-22T18:23:28  <demerzel> openjdk hmm
2011-05-22T18:23:43  <Frontier> so the options may be different ^^

2011-05-22T18:24:00  <demerzel> even on the centos vps i had
2011-05-22T18:24:23  <demerzel> should be the same tho as far as ant is concerned
2011-05-22T18:24:24  <amstan> well, i'm thinking we might have this issue on ec2 as well
2011-05-22T18:25:09  <demerzel> have you tried adding that tag?
2011-05-22T18:25:16  <Frontier> They probably support most of the Sun command line options
2011-05-22T18:25:20  <amstan> demerzel: where?
2011-05-22T18:25:34  <demerzel> yea ec2 probably won't have the same issues as some homebrew reseller
2011-05-22T18:25:50  <demerzel> considering they've probably had the issue come up a billion times
2011-05-22T18:26:02  <demerzel> i assume to the actual script
2011-05-22T18:26:07  <demerzel> unless there's an xml config file somewhere
2011-05-22T18:26:09  <demerzel> for ant that is

2011-05-22T18:29:21  <demerzel> why not just try changing that
2011-05-22T18:29:24  <demerzel> is it dying on javac or java
2011-05-22T18:29:41  <demerzel> looks like arg is a no nonsense addition of whatever the hell

2011-05-22T18:30:42  <demerzel> idk honestly i'd just be making an .sh if i were you but thats only because i would rather not dick with ant xml and just write the commands myself
2011-05-22T18:31:07  <demerzel> or at least just make the first javac statement and try to run it with the Xmx tag and see if it works
2011-05-22T18:31:15  <demerzel> if it does then you know what to do at least
2011-05-22T18:31:33  <demerzel> and its just a matter of translating it to ant

2011-05-22T18:36:16  <amstan> i don't think it's actually out of memory
2011-05-22T18:36:27  <Frontier> I don't think either, but what is it then?
2011-05-22T18:36:27  <amstan> i think it's a false error or something caused by that burst ram
2011-05-22T18:36:38  <amstan> it tries to use the whole 2gb but it can't
2011-05-22T18:36:51  <demerzel> ahhh
2011-05-22T18:36:56  <Frontier> or maybe I just set the limit for ant with ANT_OPTS, but not the sub tasks...
2011-05-22T18:36:58  <demerzel> ant runs javac in process unlike java
2011-05-22T18:37:06  <demerzel> ANT_OPTS should be doing it
2011-05-22T18:37:07  <demerzel> but
2011-05-22T18:37:10  <demerzel> If, however, you specify the attribute fork="true" on the <javac> tag you will be able to specify -J-Xms and -J-Xmx.
2011-05-22T18:37:29  <demerzel> forces it to actually launch javac separately instead of inproc with ant
2011-05-22T18:37:45  <amstan> demerzel: you can ssh in and try it
2011-05-22T18:37:47  <Frontier> Which slows down the compile in turn :p, but yeah
2011-05-22T18:37:55  <amstan> command is this: contest@aichallengebeta:~/aichallenge/ants/visualizer$ ant deploy -Djava.plugin=/usr/share/icedtea-web/plugin.jar -Ddeploy.path=/home/contest/aichallenge/website
2011-05-22T18:38:02  <amstan> sudo su contest to switch user
2011-05-22T18:38:06  <amstan> Frontier: wanna try?
2011-05-22T18:38:08  <demerzel> pass :P
2011-05-22T18:38:11  <demerzel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4134803/ant-passing-compilerarg-into-javac
2011-05-22T18:38:40  <demerzel> i don't really use linux or ant so debugging problems with those 2 is far outside my specialty
2011-05-22T18:38:50  <amstan> Frontier: ?
2011-05-22T18:39:06  <Frontier> yeah sure, I was wondering what my password was
2011-05-22T18:39:29  <demerzel> tbh this should work -- set ANT_OPTS=-Xms128m -Xmx512m
2011-05-22T18:39:33  <demerzel> but idk
2011-05-22T18:39:37  <amstan> Frontier: ssh frontrier@aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com
2011-05-22T18:39:39  <Frontier> looks, like I will need a coffee, it is 00:40 here :p
2011-05-22T18:39:41  <amstan> Frontier: hold on a sec
2011-05-22T18:39:47  <demerzel> frontrier?
2011-05-22T18:39:48  <demerzel> lol
2011-05-22T18:42:43  <amstan> Frontier: sudo su contest
2011-05-22T18:44:23  <Frontier> ok, so it is the compile-js part failing
2011-05-22T18:44:35  <amstan> yes, as shown in the pastebin
2011-05-22T18:45:23  *** asdf_ <asdf_!62eb89b6@gateway/web/freenode/ip.98.235.137.182> has joined #aichallenge
2011-05-22T18:49:58  <Frontier> it is an IOException
2011-05-22T18:52:28  <Frontier> someone solved this by increasing the number of file descriptors with "ulimit -n 2048"
2011-05-22T18:52:51  <Frontier> but mine is set to 1024, too and it doesn't work on the server
2011-05-22T18:53:00  <Frontier> i mean: it doesnt solve the problem
2011-05-22T18:56:27  <demerzel> There are memoryInitialSize (equivalent to -Xms) and memoryMaximumSize (equivalent to -Xmx) options for the javac task so try those instead of using compilerargs e.g.
2011-05-22T18:56:35  <demerzel> only other thing i've read of interest
2011-05-22T18:56:52  <demerzel> <javac srcdir="${test.src.dir}" destdir="${test.dist.dir}"   memoryInitialSize="128m"   memoryMaximumSize="512m">
2011-05-22T18:57:40  <demerzel> amstan: ticket just got a response
2011-05-22T18:57:43  <demerzel> The required changes is already done. root@aichallengebeta:/# cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory 0
2011-05-22T18:57:52  <demerzel> doesn't mean a damn thing to me but that's the meat of it
2011-05-22T18:58:17  <amstan> demerzel: it's supposed to be 1, not 0
2011-05-22T18:58:20  <Frontier> they work for javac only, not for java, and yes i tried them ;)
2011-05-22T18:58:28  <demerzel> says we should have 1732
2011-05-22T18:58:39  <Frontier> dmerzel: Yeah just found that thread, too
2011-05-22T18:58:39  <demerzel> yea but its dying on javac not java isn't it
2011-05-22T18:58:46  <demerzel> since thats the first command
2011-05-22T18:58:59  <Frontier> no it dies on java
2011-05-22T18:59:05  <demerzel> oh that's news to me then
2011-05-22T18:59:11  <Frontier> ok so lets do it
2011-05-22T18:59:53  <demerzel> amstan: feel free to respodn to the ticket you'd have to explain way too much to be worthwhile for me to
2011-05-22T19:00:33  <Frontier> "bash: echo: write error: Operation not permitted"   *cries out loud*
2011-05-22T19:00:49  <amstan> Frontier: yes, i noticed
2011-05-22T19:00:58  <demerzel> on the positive side http://aibeta.net-supremacy.com/ resolves correctly now lol
2011-05-22T19:00:58  <Frontier> I cannot set overcommit_memory, but why?
2011-05-22T19:01:58  <amstan> Frontier: idk
2011-05-22T19:02:06  <amstan> demerzel: i changed the hostname though
2011-05-22T19:02:31  <demerzel> well this has nothing to do with what linux has set
2011-05-22T19:02:35  <Frontier> we may try the other way: set the memory max to something low like 128m
2011-05-22T19:02:39  *** Kingpin13 <Kingpin13!~Kingpin13@Wikipedia/Kingpin13> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-05-22T19:02:52  <demerzel> i guess if you set another hostname up both will resolve to the same ip
2011-05-22T19:03:08  <demerzel> assuming you set the dns records up for that domain
2011-05-22T19:03:12  <Frontier> yeah that works
2011-05-22T19:03:25  <demerzel> you didn't try setting the max yet?  :P
2011-05-22T19:03:30  <demerzel> thought that was the first thing
2011-05-22T19:03:49  <amstan> Frontier: i tried..
2011-05-22T19:04:12  <Frontier> i set the max, but i set it to 700m
2011-05-22T19:04:30  <demerzel> he was setting up the javac max i think
2011-05-22T19:04:40  <demerzel> if that was ok and java was breaking taht would explain it
2011-05-22T19:04:53  <Frontier> (ANT_OPTS="-Xmx100m") now with 100m it runs through, but there seem to be file system issues
2011-05-22T19:05:22  <demerzel> try 512?  100 seems low
2011-05-22T19:05:30  <demerzel> or maybe not actually
2011-05-22T19:05:44  <demerzel> idk imma shut up and let people who know what they're doing fix it
2011-05-22T19:06:28  <Frontier> I'll settle with 256 I think, I was just testing. But I wonder why the Java process cannot find a file that it just generated.

2011-05-22T19:07:46  <Frontier> ah because "permission denied". It couldn't create a directory
2011-05-22T19:08:02  <Frontier> wtf ? amstan !?!? :p
2011-05-22T19:08:13  <amstan> Frontier: what are you doing?
2011-05-22T19:08:56  <Frontier> this is the thing McLeopold told me about. The contest user cannot create a directory inside build/deploy/org/mozilla/javascript. This is really strange I think
2011-05-22T19:09:17  <amstan> oh.. right, run ant deploy with sudo
2011-05-22T19:10:04  <Frontier> hmm ok, but usually you would compile without root privileges.
2011-05-22T19:11:42  <demerzel> i really dont understand the radius thing
2011-05-22T19:13:01  <demerzel> i am using manhattan + wrap for distance calcs but i am not sure what is going on with radius
2011-05-22T19:13:55  <demerzel> in euclidean distance isn't the square up and to the left the same distance as the one directly to the left and the one directly up?
2011-05-22T19:13:59  <demerzel> maybe my brain isnt working right
2011-05-22T19:14:52  <Frontier> wow Xmx200m is too much
2011-05-22T19:14:55  <demerzel> ah nm ok i got it lol
2011-05-22T19:14:56  <demerzel> is it?
2011-05-22T19:14:57  <demerzel> damn
2011-05-22T19:15:14  <demerzel> well ant/javac themselves would have grabbed a bunch
2011-05-22T19:15:46  <Frontier> 128m is too much as well... i guess I'll settle with 100m :p
2011-05-22T19:20:22  <Frontier> i think the java process with 128m hang up. can i just killall java or is there anything else running on java?

2011-05-22T19:24:09  <demerzel> doubt there's anything running on java
2011-05-22T19:24:16  <demerzel> sicne the server is about 2 hours old
2011-05-22T19:24:55  <Frontier> :) I used "ps -Af" to pin it down. I just always forget the command line options
2011-05-22T19:28:59  <Frontier> amstan: ok it works now if ANT_OPTS=-Xmx100m is set. It also runs without root privileges as long as you never compile and deploy as root since then directories cannot be synched from a process running as the contest user.
2011-05-22T19:32:15  <Frontier> I'll do a run with "deepclean" to see if "it needs root privileges to download rhino" as McLeopold reported.
2011-05-22T19:33:40  <Frontier> jesus christ? is that a 1GB internet connection?
2011-05-22T19:34:14  <amstan> Frontier: maybe
2011-05-22T19:34:18  <Frontier> yeah, all working without root priv.
2011-05-22T19:35:12  <Frontier> ANT_OPTS="-Xmx100m" ant deploy -Djava.plugin=/usr/share/icedtea-web/plugin.jar -Ddeploy.path=/home/contest/aichallenge/website
2011-05-22T19:36:01  <Frontier> the question is: do you want to put that into a script or is /home/contest/aichallenge/website the final destination folder?
2011-05-22T19:36:57  <amstan> Frontier: it's already in the setup script
2011-05-22T19:36:59  <amstan> so.. does it work?
2011-05-22T19:37:49  <Frontier> I'm a bit concerned still that it will work as well on 32-bit and 64-bit and with any possible update that may require more than 100mb ram, but hey... it works for now
2011-05-22T19:38:50  <Frontier> I guess the setup script is running ant as 'root'?

2011-05-22T19:38:53  <amstan> doesn't work for me
2011-05-22T19:39:00  <amstan> same error
2011-05-22T19:39:11  <Frontier> ah no! you do it wrong :p
2011-05-22T19:39:22  <amstan> it's an env variable, right?
2011-05-22T19:39:35  <Frontier> login as contest then just copy&paste the line I posted
2011-05-22T19:39:45  <amstan> i am logged in as contest
2011-05-22T19:39:47  <Frontier> but make sure the directories aren't owned by root
2011-05-22T19:39:53  <amstan> but this must work from server_setup as well
2011-05-22T19:40:20  <Frontier> ok, then tell McLeopold not to complain about having to run it as root
2011-05-22T19:40:41  <amstan> yeah, don't worry about him
2011-05-22T19:40:48  <amstan> what i'm concerned about is how to make it run at all
2011-05-22T19:41:39  <amstan> Frontier: is that an enviromental variable then?
2011-05-22T19:41:41  <Frontier> kk, so set that environment variable in the setup script then run "ant deploy -Djava.plugin=/usr/share/icedtea-web/plugin.jar -Ddeploy.path=/home/contest/aichallenge/website"
2011-05-22T19:42:40  <Frontier> it is "export ANT_OPTS=-Xmx100m" in bash, don't know about python
2011-05-22T19:42:46  <amstan> so shouldn't this work? contest@aichallengebeta:~/aichallenge/ants/visualizer$ export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx100m"
2011-05-22T19:42:53  <Frontier> yes
2011-05-22T19:42:57  <amstan> i'm running contest@aichallengebeta:~/aichallenge/ants/visualizer$ sudo ant deploy -Djava.plugin=/usr/share/icedtea-web/plugin.jar -Ddeploy.path=/home/contest/aichallenge/website just after
2011-05-22T19:43:01  <amstan> and it doesn't work
2011-05-22T19:43:06  <amstan> same ioexception
2011-05-22T19:43:16  <Frontier> because you exported it as the contest user
2011-05-22T19:43:20  <Frontier> log in as root to do it

2011-05-22T19:55:44  * amstan is installing the worker now
2011-05-22T19:56:57  <Frontier> cool, and we should add tools to the downloads section. for example the 2 visualizer downloads and whatever others are working on.
2011-05-22T19:57:32  <amstan> Frontier: tell me what to include and i'll gladly do it
2011-05-22T19:57:47  <amstan> i haven't got a straight answer on that yet
2011-05-22T19:58:07  <Frontier> visualizer.jar and html_visualizer.zip
2011-05-22T19:58:21  <amstan> what about the engine?
2011-05-22T19:58:43  <Frontier> ask McLeopold or sigh about that. I haven't seen any zip package for that
2011-05-22T19:59:00  <amstan> i'm pretty sure it's all that's in ants/

2011-05-22T20:04:16  <demerzel> ah i can fork a repo i don't have commit to?  didn't know that
2011-05-22T20:04:22  <demerzel> only use git for work and small personal shit
2011-05-22T20:04:31  <amstan> demerzel: yes, that's why forks are so popular
2011-05-22T20:04:49  <amstan> using git for work... you should be grateful for that
2011-05-22T20:04:50  <demerzel> i was forced into git by my unix-loving macboss
2011-05-22T20:05:01  <demerzel> always used svn
2011-05-22T20:05:10  <amstan> yes, i was about to say.. better than svn
2011-05-22T20:05:24  <demerzel> don't think so but not worth arguing

2011-05-22T20:05:36  <demerzel> i am familiar with git now at least it was hell when i wasn't
2011-05-22T20:05:52  <amstan> just wait a while, then try going back to svn
2011-05-22T20:05:59  <amstan> you'll start swearing at it for various things
2011-05-22T20:06:03  <amstan> like merges
2011-05-22T20:06:14  <demerzel> keep in mind i am talking from a windows perspective as always haha
2011-05-22T20:06:30  <demerzel> svn is well integrated - though smartgit is decent one you get the hang of it
2011-05-22T20:06:54  <Frontier> TortoiseSVN is a great tool under Windows. I am still waiting for the NetBeans git plugin
2011-05-22T20:07:02  * amstan waits until something crashes in this install
2011-05-22T20:07:14  <Frontier> are the workers working?
2011-05-22T20:07:33  <amstan> Frontier: i just rembered, the worker will probably fail working
2011-05-22T20:07:41  <demerzel> you use netbeans?  i'm surprised
2011-05-22T20:07:46  <demerzel> i hated how much it tried to package everything for me, i like intellij better
2011-05-22T20:07:47  <amstan> on the server that i had before i gave up on the sandbox
2011-05-22T20:08:20  <demerzel> in my os i like things to be automatically handled, in my coding not so much
2011-05-22T20:08:47  <Frontier> there is an extra space in front of "My Profile"
2011-05-22T20:08:49  <amstan> demerzel: weren't you the one that liked to double click on things?
2011-05-22T20:09:07  <demerzel> re: batch files to run compiled programs?  yes
2011-05-22T20:09:09  <amstan> Frontier: what?
2011-05-22T20:09:47  <Frontier> demerzel: actually I use Eclipse, but NetBeans has better support for php/JavaScript
2011-05-22T20:10:17  <Frontier> amstan: the menu item in the right column after you sign in says " My Profile"
2011-05-22T20:10:23  <amstan> i really liked kdevelop for the few minutes i had it going
2011-05-22T20:10:46  <demerzel> eclipse is ok but i had a hell of a time making it work with 64-bit windows 7 and 64-bit java and just gave up
2011-05-22T20:10:53  <amstan> Frontier: on the brigth green? it's fine for me, no extra space
2011-05-22T20:10:54  <Frontier> For C++ I use Code::Blocks and for Delphi... well Turbo Delphi 2006
2011-05-22T20:11:15  <demerzel> i use vs for c/c++ haha
2011-05-22T20:11:22  <demerzel> it actually has a compiler for iso c

2011-05-22T20:15:03  <Frontier> You said you would wait until the workers crash and I thought you need some rest from waiting
2011-05-22T20:15:47  <demerzel> amstan: should i mark that ticket resolved?
2011-05-22T20:15:52  <demerzel> or frontier
2011-05-22T20:15:54  <demerzel> whoever can tell me
2011-05-22T20:15:57  <Frontier> demerzel: So if I framed the 'main instance' of the map that would be ok for you?
2011-05-22T20:15:59  <amstan> demerzel: i guess
2011-05-22T20:16:06  <amstan> demerzel: for us, yes, we found a workaround
2011-05-22T20:16:10  <amstan> demerzel: but it's still broken, lol
2011-05-22T20:16:18  <demerzel> what's broken
2011-05-22T20:16:25  <demerzel> frontier: yea that would be awesome!
2011-05-22T20:16:36  <amstan> we just made sure java wasn't using above 100mb of ram
2011-05-22T20:16:45  <demerzel> i'll say something to that effect then
2011-05-22T20:16:46  <amstan> but we should be able to use 2gb
2011-05-22T20:16:52  <demerzel> agreed
2011-05-22T20:17:00  <demerzel> i can write the response i understand that
2011-05-22T20:17:08  <Frontier> amstan: the limit is per process and ant spawns a sub process now and then
2011-05-22T20:17:45  <demerzel> hmm
2011-05-22T20:17:52  <demerzel> have you ran java by itself to see what kind of memory usage you can get
2011-05-22T20:17:55  <Frontier> (but i'm really confused how it would add up to 1.7 GB)
2011-05-22T20:17:57  <demerzel> if not can i request that
2011-05-22T20:18:15  <demerzel> just run java -whatever -Xmx796M
2011-05-22T20:18:17  <demerzel> see if it works
2011-05-22T20:18:32  <demerzel> if it does then it's an ant hogging resources problem
2011-05-22T20:18:43  <demerzel> if it doesn't then we still don' have a full gig we can allocate (whcih is what we should have)
2011-05-22T20:19:27  <demerzel> oh hell i'll do it actually lol
2011-05-22T20:20:10  <Frontier> java -Xmx900m -version works
2011-05-22T20:20:40  <demerzel> ah ok
2011-05-22T20:20:46  <demerzel> nice call didn't even think about -version
2011-05-22T20:21:05  <demerzel> ok i'll resolve it
2011-05-22T20:21:07  <demerzel> ty
2011-05-22T20:21:18  <Frontier> But we get an IOError from the fork() somehow. I don't know if we can simply point at ant here.
2011-05-22T20:21:46  <demerzel> what are you forking
2011-05-22T20:21:51  <demerzel> in ant?
2011-05-22T20:22:15  <Frontier> it could be ant, the vm, the kernel... yes in the build script i fork processes
2011-05-22T20:22:33  <Frontier> well, ant does that if you set fork="yes" on a task.
2011-05-22T20:22:40  <demerzel> yea thats what i meant by 'in ant'
2011-05-22T20:22:49  <demerzel> but you are actually using a command line fork?
2011-05-22T20:22:50  <Frontier> i did that to change into a different working directory
2011-05-22T20:23:11  <Frontier> no I don't use a command line fork.
2011-05-22T20:23:15  <demerzel> ie pid_t fork
2011-05-22T20:23:41  <Frontier> No I would have to write C to do that
2011-05-22T20:24:16  <demerzel> oh duh linux has a fork() command doesn't it
2011-05-22T20:24:19  <demerzel> what about clone()
2011-05-22T20:24:46  <Frontier> whatever, ant is calling some Java method that calls fork() internally at some point
2011-05-22T20:25:12  <demerzel> ahaha ok so the fork is inside java code whic h is inside a java process whcih is forked from ant
2011-05-22T20:25:14  <Frontier> or maybe a modern replacement, but I only know about fork() to spawn sub processes on unix
2011-05-22T20:25:15  <demerzel> simple enough
2011-05-22T20:25:40  <amstan> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/118
2011-05-22T20:25:45  <amstan> :(
2011-05-22T20:25:50  <demerzel> well if you hit a brick wall that you think is a system problem pastebin it and i will ticket
2011-05-22T20:25:58  <Frontier> lol, in other words, I let ant spawn a sub process when it should run a 'java' task
2011-05-22T20:26:50  <demerzel> amstan have you tried just running it as root instead of sudo
2011-05-22T20:26:59  <demerzel> i mean yea its bad practice but worth a shot
2011-05-22T20:27:32  <amstan> should work the same
2011-05-22T20:27:49  <demerzel> if i understand that error correctly it's a permissions issue with a python script?
2011-05-22T20:28:05  <amstan> the permission is with fuse
2011-05-22T20:29:04  <Frontier> so /dev/fuse is read/write for root?
2011-05-22T20:29:39  <amstan> crw-rw---- 1 root fuse 10, 229 2011-05-23 03:55 fuse
2011-05-22T20:29:52  <amstan> i made sure contest is a fuse member
2011-05-22T20:29:53  <amstan> no deal
2011-05-22T20:30:19  <amstan> hmm
2011-05-22T20:30:30  <amstan> my other comp has it crw-rw-rw- 1 root fuse 10, 229 2011-05-22 20:21 /dev/fuse
2011-05-22T20:31:08  <Frontier> my laptop has that as well
2011-05-22T20:31:35  <Frontier> actually its group is root here
2011-05-22T20:31:50  <amstan> same issue..
2011-05-22T20:31:56  <Frontier> damn
2011-05-22T20:32:05  <amstan> maybe a reboot? lol
2011-05-22T20:32:12  <demerzel> ah shit
2011-05-22T20:32:20  <demerzel> you rebooted it as i was confirming my new password lol
2011-05-22T20:32:32  <amstan> demerzel: that's fine
2011-05-22T20:32:40  <amstan> demerzel: it'll prompt you again
2011-05-22T20:34:59  <amstan> ok, i give up, fuck this
2011-05-22T20:35:22  <Frontier> Oo no ai-contest?
2011-05-22T20:36:19  <demerzel> hmm i can't even add myself to the fuse group lol
2011-05-22T20:36:37  <amstan> why not?
2011-05-22T20:36:43  <demerzel> i mean it took the cmd
2011-05-22T20:36:47  <demerzel> but when i looked at my groups it wasn't adde
2011-05-22T20:36:47  <demerzel> d
2011-05-22T20:37:33  <demerzel> oh i had to relog
2011-05-22T20:37:34  <demerzel> now i have it
2011-05-22T20:38:10  <demerzel> did you add contest to the fuse group i assume?
2011-05-22T20:38:12  <amstan> ok.. installing the languages directly on the host
2011-05-22T20:38:15  <amstan> demerzel: yes
2011-05-22T20:38:25  <demerzel> bizarre
2011-05-22T20:38:29  <amstan> i'll just do it without a sandbox for now
2011-05-22T20:38:47  <demerzel> temp host hack sounds reasonable
2011-05-22T20:39:00  <amstan> demerzel: oh yeah, do htop if you want fun stuff
2011-05-22T20:39:32  <amstan> Frontier: the host doesn't have swap, would that matter for java?
2011-05-22T20:39:37  <demerzel> is that the super ps
2011-05-22T20:39:43  <amstan> demerzel: pretty much
2011-05-22T20:40:03  <demerzel> im off now didn't wanna be jacking with groups while you were

2011-05-22T20:41:00  <amstan> i don't think  4GB of swap would hurt
2011-05-22T20:41:09  <Frontier> demerzel: There is some tricky hack to add yourself to a group without logging out, but I forgot it :p

2011-05-22T20:44:44  <amstan> demerzel: this host sucks! lol
2011-05-22T20:44:46  <Frontier> I don't think a process knows about swap at all. It is all in the kernel realm where virtual adresses are mapped to RAM or swapped out if unused for a while. I ran Windows and Linux without swap and it works fine.
2011-05-22T20:44:56  <Frontier> lol @ host
2011-05-22T20:45:00  <amstan> Frontier: i'm thinking maybe java went over the 2GB
2011-05-22T20:45:02  <amstan> somehow
2011-05-22T20:45:21  <demerzel> amstan: i am not familiar with 'gay: swapon'
2011-05-22T20:45:35  <amstan> swapon enables swap
2011-05-22T20:45:43  <amstan> i was trying to add more swap from a file
2011-05-22T20:45:50  <demerzel> yea i know what swapon is lol
2011-05-22T20:45:50  <amstan> apparently root is not permitted to do that
2011-05-22T20:46:03  <demerzel> thats probably what 'super hyper memory' is lol
2011-05-22T20:46:06  <amstan> from stackexchange: think you were hit by the limitations of OpenVZ. OpenVZ does not allow what they call "user defined swap": Swap is only available "as a whole" for the whole system, not for individual VPSes, see
2011-05-22T20:46:26  <demerzel> ah
2011-05-22T20:46:30  <demerzel> why do you need a swap anyway
2011-05-22T20:46:38  <demerzel> what the hell are you running that needs all this memory
2011-05-22T20:46:52  <amstan> demerzel: i was just thinking just in case
2011-05-22T20:47:10  <demerzel> preoptimization
2011-05-22T20:47:24  <amstan> ugh, now what! another error
2011-05-22T20:47:38  <Frontier> maybe the virtual memory management is a bit buggy in OpenVZ. If they manage swap themselves that is.
2011-05-22T20:47:52  <demerzel> you will run into these problems on any vps vs. your home machine anyway just by design i think unless we got a dedicated host
2011-05-22T20:47:57  <demerzel> dedicated server*
2011-05-22T20:49:25  <Frontier> When I worked on Wewaii, we had a Java server running on virtual server
2011-05-22T20:50:06  <Frontier> It was slow with many users logging in, but we were using a lot of memory there.
2011-05-22T20:50:59  <Frontier> And it worked without flaws. We did not use ant or OpenJDK though.
2011-05-22T20:51:12  <Frontier> And I don't know if OpenVZ was involved

2011-05-22T20:55:38  <demerzel> same!
2011-05-22T20:55:39  <demerzel> lol
2011-05-22T20:59:26  <Frontier> this is nice btw: http://www.moeding.net/archives/20-Optimizing-virtual-memory-in-OpenVZ-I.html
2011-05-22T21:03:26  <Frontier> OpenVZ shares one kernel among all running systems. That's probably why you cannot change kernel parameters.
2011-05-22T21:11:02  <Frontier> It is also said that OpenVZ advertises virtual memory as RAM.
2011-05-22T21:12:30  <demerzel> not surprising lol
2011-05-22T21:17:13  <Frontier> Looking at the output of 'ps -A -ovsz,rsz,command' I see a lot of programs using a lot more virtual memory than resident. java for example: vsz: 1,326,292 / rsz: 223,080
2011-05-22T21:18:36  <Frontier> And since you cannot add swap files in OpenVZ, you better buy a lot of 'RAM' if you want to run a Java server :p
2011-05-22T21:20:05  <Frontier> Now I know what vm.overcommit_memory does!
2011-05-22T21:21:31  <Frontier> If you allocate virtual memory and there is not enough RAM+swap to support it if you really used it later on, Linux errors out. With vm.overcommit_memory you can allocate more virtual memory than the system can pysically support.

2011-05-22T21:28:20  <Frontier> ~17% of virtual memory is currently used

2011-05-22T21:39:16  <Frontier> burst memory is memory that doesn't belong to your vps. it is available to programs, but can be reclaimed at any time. if you don't want your programs to crash, don't use it. the biggest process will get killed first

2011-05-22T21:52:53  <demerzel> that sounds shitty
2011-05-22T21:53:00  <demerzel> makes sense tho
2011-05-22T21:59:51  <Frontier> demerzel: I'm running a simple java app right now that just goes to sleep. It uses 930 MB 'RAM'
2011-05-22T22:00:52  <demerzel> see how long it lasts?
2011-05-22T22:01:44  <Frontier> is that a question?
2011-05-22T22:03:44  <Frontier> 25 MB is the lowest it will go if I set the stack to 104 KB and Xmx2m (<- lol)
2011-05-22T22:05:19  <demerzel> wait so it juts naturally uses 930mb to run that?
2011-05-22T22:05:23  <demerzel> i thought you were testing the upper limit
2011-05-22T22:08:06  <Frontier> no it naturally uses 1 GB on my computer as well. Remember it is virtual memory!
2011-05-22T22:08:30  <demerzel> i am completely lost now
2011-05-22T22:08:33  <demerzel> thats ok i'm in 3 places at once
2011-05-22T22:09:46  <Frontier> Ok, a Java process in OpenJDK or Sun JDK uses ~1 GB of virtual memory. Out of this allocated block it really uses only 10-13 MB for a simple program.
2011-05-22T22:18:49  <Frontier> Unfortunatly in OpenVZ it is like using 1 GB of real RAM, so you HAVE to run any Java app with the -Xmx option.
2011-05-22T22:19:11  <Frontier> amstan: ^ happy reading
2011-05-22T22:25:29  <Frontier> I left the Test.java and Test.class in the visualizer folder for reference.
2011-05-22T22:26:56  <amstan> Frontier: can you submit another submission? i think the D one crashes the worker
2011-05-22T22:27:05  <amstan> also: {'errors': ['std.date and std.dateparse have been scheduled for deprecation. Please use std.datetime instead.\n']}
2011-05-22T22:27:29  <Frontier> arrr, can't they stop deprecating stuff :p
2011-05-22T22:27:44  <Frontier> it was like what? one month ago?
2011-05-22T22:28:17  <Frontier> I'll try something clean from our repo
2011-05-22T22:28:37  <Cyndre> neat - http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2573588
2011-05-22T22:29:21  <amstan> Frontier: done?
2011-05-22T22:29:28  <Cyndre> its a python ai game I just found on ycombinator.com
2011-05-22T22:30:15  <Frontier> done
2011-05-22T22:30:43  <amstan> you have the D submission right?
2011-05-22T22:31:46  <Frontier> no I used cpp this time, but did not rename the zip file
2011-05-22T22:32:32  <Frontier> *ready to be compiled*   (the first D submission was mine if that's the question)
2011-05-22T22:32:40  <amstan> yeah, it's not going to skip the D one
2011-05-22T22:32:43  <amstan> it has to do it anyway
2011-05-22T22:33:10  <Frontier> aha, that's not good :p
2011-05-22T22:33:26  <amstan> is there a save in nano?
2011-05-22T22:33:36  <Frontier> Ctrl+O
2011-05-22T22:35:18  <amstan> and is there a way to display line numbers?
2011-05-22T22:41:30  <Frontier> I have no clue.
2011-05-22T22:43:25  <amstan> we need more ppl to submit
2011-05-22T22:44:26  <_flag> How come bots aren't being ranked?
2011-05-22T22:44:41  <_flag> They were at the beginning
2011-05-22T22:45:06  <demerzel> different server
2011-05-22T22:45:57  <_flag> Different server with the same accounts/database? I'm talking about hypertriangle.com:13080
2011-05-22T22:46:33  <amstan> _flag: they're not the same
2011-05-22T22:46:44  <amstan> _flag: 13080 is going to be superseeded by this one
2011-05-22T22:46:56  <_flag> Wait, so which one are you talking about then?
2011-05-22T22:46:58  <demerzel> superceded heh
2011-05-22T22:47:08  <demerzel> aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com
2011-05-22T22:47:12  <_flag> ah
2011-05-22T22:47:12  <demerzel> they're setting it up
2011-05-22T22:47:29  <amstan> can i get more ppl to submit?
2011-05-22T22:47:39  <_flag> I'll submit in a second
2011-05-22T22:48:23  <demerzel> damn i'm only userid 6?
2011-05-22T22:48:34  <demerzel> i'll submit a cs bot haha
2011-05-22T22:48:54  <demerzel> does it even have mono yet
2011-05-22T22:48:58  <demerzel> or is that standard
2011-05-22T22:49:50  <amstan> oh.. right, i need maps
2011-05-22T22:50:23  <_flag> pfft... maps
2011-05-22T22:50:55  <amstan> i have no idea how to get them though
2011-05-22T22:51:07  <_flag> download them from github?
2011-05-22T22:51:24  <amstan> there we go
2011-05-22T22:51:24  <_flag> Run the generator?
2011-05-22T22:52:08  <demerzel> the squared distance thing is screwing me up
2011-05-22T22:52:25  <demerzel> so it's manhattan distance but with the row/col squared before added together?
2011-05-22T22:52:39  <amstan> yay
2011-05-22T22:52:40  <demerzel> it says euclidian but can that be right idk my brain isn't working right
2011-05-22T22:52:41  <amstan> it works!
2011-05-22T22:52:58  <demerzel> awesome you had me worried
2011-05-22T22:53:05  <amstan> wait, wtf?
2011-05-22T22:53:15  <amstan> nobody is eating
2011-05-22T22:53:46  <demerzel> ?
2011-05-22T22:53:48  <demerzel> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=4
2011-05-22T22:53:55  <_flag> They're starter bots, they don't eat
2011-05-22T22:53:59  <CIA-48> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * r52ab8b9 / worker/worker.py : hopefully might fix #119 - http://bit.ly/jOVkiZ
2011-05-22T22:54:06  <amstan> _flag: you sure?
2011-05-22T22:54:09  <_flag> Or they do, but they do it poorly
2011-05-22T22:54:21  <_flag> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=4
2011-05-22T22:54:25  <demerzel> the starter bots just basically go north lol
2011-05-22T22:54:27  <amstan> wtf??? lol
2011-05-22T22:54:46  <demerzel> unless they can't in which case they back up 1 and then go north again
2011-05-22T22:54:46  <demerzel> haha
2011-05-22T22:54:48  <_flag> The starter bot is made to try all four directions in a clockwise sequence
2011-05-22T22:55:00  <_flag> Nothing else
2011-05-22T22:55:00  <amstan> ok.. at least that
2011-05-22T22:55:02  <demerzel> really?  the cpp one just went north and got stuck when i uploaded it
2011-05-22T22:55:11  <_flag> Then I think it's broken
2011-05-22T22:55:22  <_flag> Or someone told me the wrong spec
2011-05-22T22:55:40  <demerzel> damn 1000 turns
2011-05-22T22:55:44  <_flag> That's what my C one does anyway
2011-05-22T22:56:04  <demerzel> yea look at purple in that game @ turn 632
2011-05-22T22:56:16  <demerzel> all of the ones hitting that big water llump just run into each other haha
2011-05-22T22:56:35  <demerzel> the first time they can't go e/w/n

2011-05-22T22:58:48  <demerzel> i am gonna try to do this without pathfinding
2011-05-22T22:58:55  <demerzel> just pure heuristic tile weight
2011-05-22T22:58:59  <demerzel> probably going to be a dismal failure
2011-05-22T22:59:47  <_flag> What's the status on the/a tcp server?
2011-05-22T22:59:58  <demerzel> is dhartmei not doing it again?
2011-05-22T23:00:12  <demerzel> i can prob swing one if not but i assume he is

2011-05-22T23:00:27  <_flag> Is he aware that this is even going on?
2011-05-22T23:00:34  <demerzel> he was there in the last 2
2011-05-22T23:00:40  <demerzel> but maybe not since it's not exactly well advertised
2011-05-22T23:00:51  <_flag> McLeopold was making a python one, but I'm not sure how that's going
2011-05-22T23:01:04  <demerzel> i'd make a pure c one if i did
2011-05-22T23:01:10  <demerzel> still have my socket code from last year
2011-05-22T23:01:40  <demerzel> maybe when they move to ec2 i'll just take the vps if it isn't a pile of shit
2011-05-22T23:02:14  <amstan> yeah, i'm not sure, i need mcleopold to take a look at it
2011-05-22T23:02:16  <_flag> I was thinking the old one could be adapted but the problem is that it was written with its own implementation of the game, and ants is a lot more complicated than PlanetWars
2011-05-22T23:02:19  <amstan> contestbot: seen mcleopold
2011-05-22T23:02:20  <contestbot> amstan: mcleopold was last seen in #aichallenge 21 hours, 39 minutes, and 29 seconds ago: <McLeopold> k
2011-05-22T23:04:33  <amstan> demerzel: apparently playgame.py includes options to write the inputs, outputs and error from bots to files
2011-05-22T23:04:48  <amstan> demerzel: see *_logs options
2011-05-22T23:05:22  <demerzel> interesting
2011-05-22T23:05:26  <demerzel> is that causing problems?
2011-05-22T23:05:37  <amstan> demerzel: weren't you asking about that?
2011-05-22T23:05:44  <demerzel> or are you telling me that if i were to implement playgame
2011-05-22T23:05:50  <amstan> no
2011-05-22T23:05:54  <amstan> remember when i suggested tee?
2011-05-22T23:06:01  <demerzel> barely because i don't know what tee is
2011-05-22T23:06:52  <demerzel> oh apparently it's the term for >>
2011-05-22T23:06:57  <demerzel> ok now i am with you
2011-05-22T23:08:02  <demerzel> dhartmei's server used a direct TCP connection
2011-05-22T23:08:10  <demerzel> although i guess you could wrap the output in json or something
2011-05-22T23:08:23  <demerzel> or point to it idk i am rambling
2011-05-22T23:08:54  <amstan> playgame.py is just a wrapper around ants.py
2011-05-22T23:09:04  <amstan> which adds those options for logging and stuff
2011-05-22T23:09:12  <amstan> i'm pretty sure it could be adapted for tcp
2011-05-22T23:12:30  <demerzel> would have to be done by somebody else since it would be easier for me to just rewrite in c__ than try to tweak python
2011-05-22T23:12:42  <demerzel> if there's a volunteer i'm all for it lol
