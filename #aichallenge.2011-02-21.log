2011-02-21T13:42:13  <antimatroid1> looks good :)
2011-02-21T13:47:42  <antimatroid1> Is the engine broken?
2011-02-21T13:48:08  <antimatroid1> at the end of the game red is pretty much walking on top of yellow at the bottom right of screen?
2011-02-21T13:48:25  <Frontier> oh I haven't checked so far
2011-02-21T13:49:36  <Frontier> The rendering is still pretty slow. A keyframe animation system is absolute overload for moving some pixels ^^
2011-02-21T13:50:08  <Frontier> so the yellow pixels either have no 'd' commands or I don't parse them correctly
2011-02-21T13:50:26  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay

2011-02-21T13:51:57  <Frontier> good night!
2011-02-21T13:52:43  <Frontier> the fact that this happens at the borders of the map might be hinting to the engine. but i'll have to see
2011-02-21T13:56:24  <janzert> with firefox whenever an ant wraps from one edge to another the square it wraps to doesn't get set back to land when the ant moves away
2011-02-21T13:57:03  <janzert> which might be the same as what you're referring to above

2011-02-21T15:55:31  <janzert> :)
2011-02-21T15:56:42  <janzert> that last persistent spot, looks like a food that could be spawned by both a red and yellow at the same time but spawns as red then immediately dies with the yellow ant, maybe?
2011-02-21T15:57:02  <janzert> seems like it could quite likely be an engine bug anyway
2011-02-21T16:03:47  <Frontier> I found that there are several such spots on the map
2011-02-21T16:08:33  <janzert> yeah, I see at least one more now on the eastern side of that same central area also caused by a 'simultaneous' spawn.

2011-02-21T16:10:23  <janzert> actually maybe it isn't simultaneous spawn but something else
2011-02-21T16:11:20  <janzert> seems like the food spawns at turn 90, close enough that it should spawn a yellow ant, but doesn't
2011-02-21T16:11:56  <Frontier> well, McLeopold assured me that no food is instantaneously converted to an ant
2011-02-21T16:15:09  <janzert> seems like it becomes a zombie square ;) several ants pass by it even though it looks like food, and then when it finally is stepped on at 330 by a red ant it stays red after the ant steps away
2011-02-21T16:20:58  <Frontier> yeah, several food squares become zombie squares. the fact that i turn the squares with food or ants into objects with an id, makes them possible
2011-02-21T16:22:10  <janzert> so basically it means food is disappearing from the map right?
2011-02-21T16:22:47  <Frontier> well... in the visualizer food is an ant without a player :)
2011-02-21T16:23:00  <Frontier> it keeps it's id when it is converted
2011-02-21T16:23:51  <janzert> and when the engine hasn't said anything if another ant steps on it it becomes that color?
2011-02-21T16:24:42  <Frontier> no, I don't have any gameplay rules in the visualizer
2011-02-21T16:25:30  <Frontier> that said a 'kill <row> <col>' command kills anything at that location
2011-02-21T16:25:49  <janzert> what stops the square from going back to food color once an ant steps on and back off?
2011-02-21T16:26:02  <janzert> or even just ground color?
2011-02-21T16:26:21  <janzert> which is what my naive idea of how it would be implemented would expect
2011-02-21T16:26:25  <Frontier> ground color is no longer an object, so that isnt possible at all
2011-02-21T16:27:04  <janzert> I guess how do you determine what to color a square when an ant steps off
2011-02-21T16:27:41  <janzert> not that it really matters, there does seem to be a problem with the info fed to the visualizer
2011-02-21T16:27:58  <Frontier> The replay file contains commands like 'a <row> <col> <player>' and if there is a food item at that location the food becomes an ant
2011-02-21T16:28:39  <janzert> I'm just surprised by the behavior in the face of that bad input
2011-02-21T16:29:35  <Frontier> ok, what situation exactly do you mean? as long as there is no 'a' command i will not convert any food to an ant
2011-02-21T16:30:21  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~delt0r@188-22-30-168.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-21T16:30:39  <Frontier> the ants can walk over it as long as they whish. and i think a visualizer should not do more than what the replay dictates
2011-02-21T16:30:41  <janzert> so there is apparently a food at a location, it shows on the map as a food square, an ant walks onto that location, the square is drawn as that ant, the ant then steps off but the square is still drawn as that ant
2011-02-21T16:30:56  <janzert> or at least as the ants color
2011-02-21T16:31:36  <janzert> I would expect it to go back to the ground color or barring that the food color
2011-02-21T16:32:27  <Frontier> I don't know yet what causes this. As I said, the objects can overlap and will in case of a collision.
2011-02-21T16:33:15  <janzert> yep, in which case I would expect last drawn to 'win' and be drawn
2011-02-21T16:33:16  <Frontier> And I assume that food spawn, ant spawn and ant death all happen in separate turns.
2011-02-21T16:33:38  <janzert> yep, none of that is surprising to me
2011-02-21T16:34:10  <Frontier> Ok, I 'could' check for collisions myself and work around the real problem :p
2011-02-21T16:34:47  <janzert> when objects overlap do they in anyway overwrite each other?
2011-02-21T16:34:59  <Frontier> Currently collisions are just 'oh there is more than 1 ant on that square that has a kill command'
2011-02-21T16:35:35  <Frontier> no they don't, they have ids, like a database table
2011-02-21T16:35:47  <janzert> I'm not too worried about the visualizer correctly handling situations that it's not suppose to receive ;)
2011-02-21T16:35:48  <Frontier> (only in the visualizer, so i can track them)
2011-02-21T16:36:24  <Frontier> I would like to recreate the old visualization as a zoom level, so i kept the ids
2011-02-21T16:36:32  <janzert> I'm just trying to understand the behavior of why the food (that shouldn't be there) ends up drawn as an ant that steps on it
2011-02-21T16:36:38  <Frontier> maybe with the simple grid view it would be easier without
2011-02-21T16:37:58  <Frontier> I'll check that tomorrow with McLeopold. Maybe he can make it so that I don't receive complete ant/food state info on every turn. Not that it is bad, but the file size is quite huge already
2011-02-21T16:38:21  <janzert> I guess the maybe basic thing I'm not understanding is how do you decide what color to make a square when an ant steps off?
2011-02-21T16:40:13  <janzert> e.g. the sequence from turn 329 to 331 has an ant step onto an apparent food and then step off and leave a red square behind
2011-02-21T16:48:43  <Frontier> i dont color the map squares at all. i only spawn objects (food, as pale yellow) and color them when the replay file tells me so
2011-02-21T16:49:59  <Frontier> obviously there is some kind of ... misbehaviour
2011-02-21T16:51:09  <Frontier> debugging will be easier when the file doesn't contain full state info any more. maybe i should make the vis. click sensitive as well so it can tell me what is exactly under a square

2011-02-21T16:52:08  <janzert> since food is an ant without a player, I assume it is drawn through the same path as the ants?

2011-02-21T16:54:04  <janzert> it was suppose to be within the next few weeks, but I think since Jeff dropped out of sight again that no one knows now
2011-02-21T16:55:11  <Frontier> ok, so i can take the next steps slowly. now that it is almost working. i just wonder how i would integrated the visualizer with the backend.
2011-02-21T16:55:46  <Frontier> I have a better feeling when I know there is at least one working version of the whole system.
2011-02-21T16:56:15  <janzert> yeah, unfortunately so far as I know zero work has been done on the backend from planetwars and the new one isn't suppose to be ready for this contest
2011-02-21T16:56:31  <Frontier> How would the replay file name be passed to the script? where are the replays stored? etc.

2011-02-21T19:48:51  <Frontier> You've got mail.
2011-02-21T19:48:56  <McLeopold> just read it
2011-02-21T19:49:37  <McLeopold> do you gave a github clone?
2011-02-21T19:49:46  <Frontier> yes
2011-02-21T19:50:05  <Frontier> a little old maybe... what was the update command again?
2011-02-21T19:50:23  <McLeopold> git pull will do the merge, you might want the other command
2011-02-21T19:51:42  <Frontier> git pull sounds good. what other command is there?
2011-02-21T19:51:52  <McLeopold> i can't remember...

2011-02-21T19:52:21  <McLeopold> I'm not good at merging yet

2011-02-21T19:52:58  <MAda> When is the next challenge going to be!!!
2011-02-21T19:53:04  <Frontier> Eclipse used to have good plugins for CVS and SVN to do that
2011-02-21T19:53:06  <pgpaskar_> good question
2011-02-21T19:53:16  <McLeopold> yeah, I've got those, I use eclipse
2011-02-21T19:53:26  <McLeopold> just havent hooked up git yet
2011-02-21T19:53:29  <Frontier> oh is there a git plugin?
2011-02-21T19:53:43  <MAda> Does anyone know?
2011-02-21T19:54:00  <Frontier> MAda: no, everyone is on vacation :p
2011-02-21T19:54:12  <MAda> ETA?
2011-02-21T19:54:38  <Frontier> 'the next weeks'?
2011-02-21T19:54:45  <McLeopold> EGit
2011-02-21T19:55:15  <McLeopold> okay, let me do a little directory surgery

2011-02-21T19:58:28  <Frontier> As long as I don't have commit access to the repo I can go with the command line interface. 'epsilon' is still fairly easy to get running locally.
2011-02-21T19:59:27  <CIA-14> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r94c45c5 / (13 files in 3 dirs): Moved visualizer files to viewer dir. - http://bit.ly/hCoI3h
2011-02-21T19:59:31  <Frontier> We may want to go back to user generated maps again. An editor that keeps track of symmetry would be neat
2011-02-21T19:59:43  <McLeopold> Frontier: okay, I've moved my "viewer" stuff to a viewer directory.
2011-02-21T20:00:01  <McLeopold> If you make a visualizer folder in your fork, the I can pull in a push request.
2011-02-21T20:00:23  <McLeopold> Frontier: was tron user generated?
2011-02-21T20:00:32  <Frontier> interesting output of git: ants/{visualizer => viewer}/README.md
2011-02-21T20:01:00  <Frontier> As far as I know there were hand made maps in tron right at the start
2011-02-21T20:01:21  <McLeopold> ah
2011-02-21T20:01:42  <McLeopold> Maybe a web tool to "paint" maps, plus a test and submission feature?
2011-02-21T20:02:09  <Frontier> That would be 10x better than random maps ^^
2011-02-21T20:02:37  <McLeopold> Random maps will be cool.  I'm working on some created by voronoi diagrams.
2011-02-21T20:03:10  <Frontier> i thought these diagrams are generated out of binary functions
2011-02-21T20:03:43  <McLeopold> voronoi?
2011-02-21T20:04:07  <Frontier> something like that anyway :p

2011-02-21T20:04:28  <McLeopold> so, which fork is yours?
2011-02-21T20:05:27  <McLeopold> did you just clone local?
2011-02-21T20:06:06  <Frontier> I only have a local clone and no write access.
2011-02-21T20:06:26  <Frontier> Karnaugh-Veitch was the name of the diagram
2011-02-21T20:08:57  <McLeopold> Frontier: if you create a github fork, then you can push you changes to it, and I can pull them to the main repo.
2011-02-21T20:09:41  <Frontier> How do I do that?
2011-02-21T20:10:07  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge <-- go here, click "Fork Project"
2011-02-21T20:10:44  <Frontier> oh, i went into 'ants' and clicked fork
2011-02-21T20:10:44  <McLeopold> maybe it's just "Fork"
2011-02-21T20:10:53  <McLeopold> well, that's okay
2011-02-21T20:11:01  <Frontier> it forked the project, ok
2011-02-21T20:11:18  <McLeopold> okay, then you need to clone that separately from your other clone

2011-02-21T20:11:27  <McLeopold> wait...
2011-02-21T20:11:39  <Frontier> this is a feature i don't know from the other versioning tools. at least if it is better than fork and the merge horror i use to know
2011-02-21T20:11:39  <McLeopold> amstan: can Frontier have access to push changes to aichallenge?
2011-02-21T20:12:27  <amstan> McLeopold: you sure?
2011-02-21T20:12:52  <amstan> Frontier: username?
2011-02-21T20:13:01  <McLeopold> well, he's working on the visualizer
2011-02-21T20:15:40  <Frontier> mleise
2011-02-21T20:16:20  <amstan> Frontier: done
2011-02-21T20:16:41  <McLeopold> okay, now, instead of cloning your fork, clone the original
2011-02-21T20:16:57  <Frontier> thanks. i wont break anything. i've worked on two large projects already.
2011-02-21T20:16:58  <McLeopold> then you can dump your stuff into aichallenge/ants/visualizer
2011-02-21T20:17:29  <McLeopold> if you stay within that dir, I don't think we will have issues.
2011-02-21T20:17:39  <McLeopold> I'm staying within the ants dir only, just to be sure
2011-02-21T20:18:51  <Frontier> ok, i copy the files from my web server to the git clone...
2011-02-21T20:19:01  <McLeopold> git commit -a
2011-02-21T20:19:06  <McLeopold> then...
2011-02-21T20:19:08  <McLeopold> git push
2011-02-21T20:19:19  <McLeopold> and we should see the irc cia message
2011-02-21T20:19:30  <McLeopold> wait...
2011-02-21T20:19:31  <amstan> you should git status often
2011-02-21T20:19:41  <McLeopold> you need to to git add <file> first
2011-02-21T20:19:55  <McLeopold> yeah, git status will tell you what you added
2011-02-21T20:20:06  <amstan> http://progit.org/book/
2011-02-21T20:20:06  <Frontier> git status tells me what I changed, right?
2011-02-21T20:20:09  <amstan> yes
2011-02-21T20:20:14  <Frontier> or also what others changed?
2011-02-21T20:20:24  <Frontier> (i.e. works online?)
2011-02-21T20:20:24  <amstan> no
2011-02-21T20:20:44  <amstan> git status is what was changed from last commit, that was not commited yet
2011-02-21T20:22:18  <McLeopold> Frontier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1331385/how-can-i-see-incoming-commits-in-git
2011-02-21T20:22:44  <McLeopold> That helps me, it might be useful.
2011-02-21T20:29:52  <Frontier> what does this mean?: You can't push to git://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge.git
2011-02-21T20:29:52  <Frontier>   Use git@github.com:aichallenge/aichallenge.git

2011-02-21T21:00:49  <Frontier> Ok, I should remove the FTP button linking to my laptop now that it is in the official repo. .. and clean up the code, and so on.
2011-02-21T21:01:54  <Frontier> I can learn a few JavaScript tricks from you. You use a lot of $... notations
2011-02-21T21:03:03  <Frontier> But now that it is 2:47 am ... i don't want to end up like antimatroid ^^, good night

2011-02-21T21:08:15  <antimatroid1> is the input still mostly like the current input format in the specs?
