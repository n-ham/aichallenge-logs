2011-03-25T00:00:08  <sigh> moongrass: yeah, mostly... but I found the docs a bit inconsistent for Python when I was playing around with it
2011-03-25T00:00:24  <sigh> I haven't had a lot of experience with the library, just messing around with simple stuff
2011-03-25T00:00:40  <moongrass> oh well, i'll have the source at least
2011-03-25T00:03:34  <moongrass> btw, (and this gonna be a long shot) but would you consider it at all plausible to use features in cv as properties -building blocks- for creating a language/grammar that could be a superset of natural languages?
2011-03-25T00:04:10  <sigh> they are completely different things?
2011-03-25T00:04:47  <moongrass> well, take simple nouns, verbs and adjectives in natural languages
2011-03-25T00:04:53  <sigh> like?
2011-03-25T00:05:13  <moongrass> "pensil", "walk", "blue"
2011-03-25T00:05:31  <sigh> blue is "easy" to detect
2011-03-25T00:05:35  <moongrass> they are inherently based on spatial phenomena, no?
2011-03-25T00:05:48  <moongrass> or physical phenomena
2011-03-25T00:06:00  <sigh> pencil is hard, but you could make a program to do it using training, and opencv will help with that
2011-03-25T00:06:12  <moongrass> right
2011-03-25T00:06:19  <sigh> walk it much harder... I don't know if that is possible currently
2011-03-25T00:06:47  <moongrass> it would require "video", i guess
2011-03-25T00:06:55  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-25T00:07:17  <moongrass> anyway, if you could build a basic vocab in this way and...
2011-03-25T00:08:03  <sigh> with pencil, the program will essentially be saying "the features in this image look the same as those in the pencils I've seen in the training set"
2011-03-25T00:08:03  <moongrass> use them as dictionary entry info, they might serve as building blocks to describe more complex vocab to?
2011-03-25T00:08:42  <sigh> maybe, but the "definition" of pencil in the program would be pretty opaque
2011-03-25T00:08:46  <moongrass> but to look "the same", they have some data in common, no?
2011-03-25T00:08:59  <moongrass> some pattern, if you will
2011-03-25T00:09:25  <sigh> you wont be far wrong if you think of it as saying that the relationship between edges and corners are similar
2011-03-25T00:09:41  <moongrass> right
2011-03-25T00:10:28  <moongrass> anyway, i have plenty of experimenting to do :)

2011-03-25T00:10:54  <sigh> moongrass: for an example of more sophisticated features look at the pictures here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform#Keypoint_localization
2011-03-25T00:11:17  <sigh> this algorithm uses specially selected key points in the picture as features
2011-03-25T00:12:13  <sigh> my point is that "features" are always very simple things, just chosen well
2011-03-25T00:12:28  <moongrass> yeah, that could be an interesting angle too
2011-03-25T00:12:40  <moongrass> simple is good :)
2011-03-25T00:12:44  <sigh> :)
2011-03-25T00:15:06  <sigh> moongrass: btw, even then it is still a glorified corner detector... which is why I said you should look at edge and corner detectors first
2011-03-25T00:15:31  <sigh> simple ones are surprisingly easy to understand and quick to code up :)
2011-03-25T00:16:09  <moongrass> music to my ears
2011-03-25T00:16:17  <moongrass> thanks for all the pointers
2011-03-25T00:16:22  <sigh> no worries

2011-03-25T05:44:59  <Stocha> opencv then. Interesting. I wish i had time to dig through it :p
2011-03-25T05:46:48  <Stocha> i'm too busy trying to understand ant game theory at the moment i guess. I don't know if i'm really getting anywhere. But still is fun. I'm frustrated at the gathering food methodology at the moment. To do it with a guaranted optimality in every cases using whatever information is available seems not so trivial now.
2011-03-25T05:47:58  <Stocha> I guess i have to build at least something satisfying before getting involved in trying to sorting out the fighting resolution methods.
2011-03-25T05:54:48  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@46.112.46.35> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-25T05:57:45  <antimatroid> Stocha: you might be able to treat it a bit like a knapsack problem?
2011-03-25T05:57:54  <antimatroid> at least people seemed to with planet wars
2011-03-25T05:58:02  <antimatroid> that's for choosing which ants to send to which food
2011-03-25T05:58:49  <Stocha> looks more like Travelling salesman problem to me at the momeent
2011-03-25T05:59:04  <Stocha> although i doubt that the optimal solution will really be usefull in practice.
2011-03-25T05:59:34  <Stocha> Still it's probably usefull to understand a bit what's going on in there :p
2011-03-25T05:59:35  <antimatroid> hmm, my thought is more like this situation: b....*...a..*
2011-03-25T05:59:45  <antimatroid> clearly you want to go for the middle * first if you are a
2011-03-25T05:59:51  <Stocha> A very interesting problem though is traffic-jam control
2011-03-25T05:59:55  <Stocha> that one is nasty i think also
2011-03-25T06:00:14  <antimatroid> it's not as trivial as i made out
2011-03-25T06:00:23  <antimatroid> but you have to admit it's quite easy to do fairly well?
2011-03-25T06:00:35  <Stocha> then you can add both. Food to get before opponent through one (ore severall) tiny corridor.
2011-03-25T06:00:58  <Stocha> With hard distance sorting.
2011-03-25T06:01:22  <antimatroid> another option is to try and make a tree with "stringed" moves
2011-03-25T06:01:58  <antimatroid> but i suspect people will want to squeeze anything they can out of a tree on battles
2011-03-25T06:02:01  <Stocha> I don't know. Think we have something as hard as salesman if we want optimality. But then what will we do with optimality, that's the question. In most cases the simplest solution is maybe enough. That's the question.
2011-03-25T06:02:19  <antimatroid> nah, i'm after neat problems, not what works :P
2011-03-25T06:02:45  <Stocha> It will depends on the fighting rules, and how hard they are to solve right. Or reasonably right. I think a good food gathering will give a huge advantage.
2011-03-25T06:03:17  <antimatroid> i agree with that, and that's the way it should be
2011-03-25T06:03:18  <Stocha> Arguably it will depends on map generation also
2011-03-25T06:03:38  <antimatroid> i'm pretty tempted to carve maps with at least a 2x2 block
2011-03-25T06:03:43  <Stocha> with the map i'm using currently, having a good food/ territory policy is very decisive.
2011-03-25T06:04:20  <Stocha> I think traffic jam will be one really interesting problem. Although once everyone does the right things, it might have too strong an influence on the outcome.
2011-03-25T06:04:39  <antimatroid> traffic jams aren't that bad?
2011-03-25T06:04:46  <antimatroid> you can collide with enemies remember
2011-03-25T06:04:51  <Stocha> there is also the trouble of blocking. Wich also is an interesting problem to do right. Both are in interaction with each other anyway.
2011-03-25T06:04:53  <antimatroid> so you guys can just charge
2011-03-25T06:05:34  <Stocha> Think we have to tests some quite good bots with very free looking maps first. And adjust some hard coded rules after that. We'll have to have the combat setting settled before sorting through maps also.
2011-03-25T06:06:02  <antimatroid> nah, maps can be changed in the first part of the contest
2011-03-25T06:06:07  <Stocha> Trafic jams are bad, when you are trying to get through a hole from your main food source to the opponents.
2011-03-25T06:06:43  <Stocha> Or just when you want to do some massive exploration trhough a loop hole.
2011-03-25T06:07:20  <antimatroid> that will be an interesting problem

2011-03-25T06:07:29  <Stocha> Let's say you have a continent with too outgoing corridors east and north
2011-03-25T06:07:30  <antimatroid> path finding when there is a region you don't want to go through
2011-03-25T06:07:45  <Stocha> and are having a ration of + 3 ants a turn
2011-03-25T06:08:17  <Stocha> then you can't hope to put in +3 ant at the north gate every turn. Unless you happen to be loosing ground.
2011-03-25T06:08:53  <Stocha> the simple thing of realising where are the gates is not that evident to me yet :p
2011-03-25T06:09:17  <Stocha> I have developped some concept around it. I have yet to test them in concrete settings.
2011-03-25T06:09:46  <Stocha> I think the "ant dies in same square" is enough for studying thoses problems. because my bot have it so wrong at the moment :p
2011-03-25T06:10:12  <Stocha> it's really too early to study early/ middle game fighting strategies for me yet.
2011-03-25T06:10:42  <Stocha> Then i have that hard choice to make between simple efficient algorithm and slower more powerfull solvers.
2011-03-25T06:11:36  <Stocha> I probably should go with some middle ground. To make a bot that have it a little bit less wrong, before getting into too much efficiency being optimal.
2011-03-25T06:12:15  <Stocha> Handling the ennemies is very important also You can't allow a single ennemy ant to harvest your food sources in place of your own ants :p
2011-03-25T06:12:34  <Stocha> So i guess i should test heavilly the ant die on same square at first;
2011-03-25T06:13:39  <Stocha> I hope i'll have some working prototype of a more credible food gatherer in a few days. We'll see :p
2011-03-25T06:14:56  <Stocha> In the bot games i have seens, there is always a sense of territory owner ship
2011-03-25T06:15:23  <Stocha> sometimes one bot just kinda own everything. But most of the time they have clear boundaries. At least clear to my eyes.
2011-03-25T06:15:47  <Stocha> Often they are naturally determined by the maps loopholes wich act as natural frontiers.
2011-03-25T06:16:15  <Stocha> Even the almost pure random bots exhibited that. (although they really took their time compared to more advanced bots)
2011-03-25T06:16:40  <Stocha> If the ground was fully open (no water) it would really be different.
2011-03-25T06:17:19  <Stocha> i use 40% ground i think as of now. It gives plenty of thoses gateways things. Though most of the time there is more that one gate from one region to another.
2011-03-25T06:19:08  <Stocha> The very early exploration is very decisive also. And it's probably tricky to get full right. Maybe we'll go with a special behavior for beginnings games; (provided that the map shares some common factors with the one i'm doing test on now)
2011-03-25T06:19:59  <Stocha> antimatroid : you can collide with the ennemy, but hardly can collide with yourself.

2011-03-25T08:46:21  <Stocha> I guess you have to let the food be an ant. And then it can move to let some room for the later ants.

2011-03-25T13:03:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: was that meant to be in favour or against asymmetric maps?
2011-03-25T13:15:01  <janzert> I think it was against very unbalanced or easily solvable maps, which certainly some subset of unsymmetric maps fall into :)
2011-03-25T13:19:53  <antimatroid> i'm still not really sure how to make "fair" asymmetric maps
2011-03-25T13:20:16  <antimatroid> i've got one halfway done that tries to place 1 water square in each players "base" set at a time
2011-03-25T13:20:45  <janzert> right now I agree, until we have games going on so we can figure out what features make a map bad we can't
2011-03-25T13:21:08  <antimatroid> but to do random walks is a bit harder, i can start x random walks in each players starting positions, but i can't easilly contrain them to those squares
2011-03-25T13:21:15  <antimatroid> easily constrain*

2011-03-25T13:26:07  <amstan> you're right.. it's kinda hard to make asymmetric maps
2011-03-25T13:26:18  <antimatroid> amstan: i'm still going to make them
2011-03-25T13:26:29  <antimatroid> but i really don't think asymmetric maps will work well in an ai contest
2011-03-25T13:26:35  <antimatroid> there's already enough noise in the rankings
2011-03-25T13:27:35  <amstan> yes, pretty much what mcleopold said
2011-03-25T13:27:38  <amstan> i agree 100% with him

2011-03-25T13:35:01  <amstan> ok
2011-03-25T13:35:01  <antimatroid> i added visualiser to the site one
2011-03-25T13:35:30  <antimatroid> .. and then deleted it
2011-03-25T13:35:39  <amstan> ok
2011-03-25T13:35:41  <amstan> cool
2011-03-25T13:36:51  <McLeopold> antimatroid: is there a fast function to determine if a square is visible?
2011-03-25T13:39:01  <McLeopold> And for the record, I'm for mostly balanced asymmetric maps, if we can figure out how.  Just against naive methods of attempting to make every map balanced.
2011-03-25T13:39:39  <McLeopold> as long as the draw margin is low enough to gain some information from the game
2011-03-25T13:40:59  <McLeopold> I think a good starting spot is ensure everyone has an equal distance map to other players, and everyone has equal territory to start
2011-03-25T13:45:37  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm thinking nearest neighbor, then check the distance, with some short circuits
2011-03-25T13:46:35  <antimatroid> McLeopold: the best method I know is my painting one
2011-03-25T13:46:46  <antimatroid> where you paint from all ants simultaneously
2011-03-25T13:46:50  <McLeopold> but I'm trying to go *faster* :)
2011-03-25T13:47:04  <McLeopold> I don't need the whole vision, just if 1 square is visible
2011-03-25T13:47:19  <antimatroid> check distances to ants?
2011-03-25T13:47:19  <McLeopold> I don't know how to make a kdtree on a torus :(
2011-03-25T13:47:53  <antimatroid> brb, my internet is failing
2011-03-25T13:48:00  <McLeopold> I guess the painting algo would do best, if I do multiple queries

2011-03-25T14:10:37  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I just thought of how to build a kdtree on a torus
2011-03-25T14:11:44  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/2U1wXxJy
2011-03-25T14:11:50  <antimatroid> there's some noisy asymmetric maps
2011-03-25T14:11:54  <antimatroid> McLeopold: :)
2011-03-25T14:12:12  <McLeopold> and a nearest neighbor query would help for other stuff like efficient food gathering
2011-03-25T14:12:42  <McLeopold> is the map checking for islands?
2011-03-25T14:13:10  <antimatroid> i don't think so, you end up with maps like that from noise
2011-03-25T14:13:20  <antimatroid> it's better once you do random walks
2011-03-25T14:13:45  <McLeopold> can you add funk?
2011-03-25T14:14:06  <antimatroid> funk?
2011-03-25T14:14:10  <antimatroid> i want to do random walk ones
2011-03-25T14:14:14  <antimatroid> noise was just easier to do first
2011-03-25T14:14:38  <antimatroid> i don't know how do do walks as fairly though
2011-03-25T14:14:56  <antimatroid> i might need to work out how to wrap a walk to a basis
2011-03-25T14:16:16  <McLeopold> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_in_'da_Noise,_Bring_in_'da_Funk
2011-03-25T14:16:42  <McLeopold> antimatroid: can you record a walk and repeat it?
2011-03-25T14:17:02  <antimatroid> one could pretty easily but why?
2011-03-25T14:17:11  <antimatroid> i just do them simultaneously for symmetric
2011-03-25T14:17:15  <McLeopold> to make a random walk map symmetric
2011-03-25T14:17:21  <McLeopold> oh, same thing
2011-03-25T14:17:53  <antimatroid> i have like 30*n walks for the symmetric map gen on the site
2011-03-25T14:18:04  <antimatroid> you can set the number of walks to run simultaneously in the parameters at the top
2011-03-25T14:18:24  <antimatroid> i've tried playing around with the distribution random uses, but haven't really noticed any difference
2011-03-25T14:19:18  <antimatroid> those maps above would be quite cool to play with those
2011-03-25T14:19:31  <antimatroid> you have locks of 1 width bits, bot not that could really block anything
2011-03-25T14:19:43  <McLeopold> you could super impose the noise symmetrically?
2011-03-25T14:19:43  <antimatroid> so good battle would win i think, but not cause stalemates
2011-03-25T14:19:53  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-03-25T14:20:02  <McLeopold> for symmetric noise maps
2011-03-25T14:20:05  <antimatroid> noise can just be done symmetrically simultaneously :P
2011-03-25T14:20:18  <McLeopold> I guess I'm no help...
2011-03-25T14:20:40  <antimatroid> with the tiling the way it is, i don't think you can check "accessibility" by traversing the base set
2011-03-25T14:20:47  <antimatroid> because the wrapping is different
2011-03-25T14:21:07  <antimatroid> (your ideas are always welcome, i'm just pointing out how i've done things :))
2011-03-25T14:21:12  <McLeopold> are you doing walks with 3x3 sized ants?
2011-03-25T14:21:22  <antimatroid> no, all walks are just a single cell atm
2011-03-25T14:22:17  <antimatroid> if you actually make a Block object, you can make movement faster by making the "move block" function a bit smarter (copy old locations that blocks are moving into)
2011-03-25T14:23:08  <antimatroid> i would go with a 2x2 block at first
2011-03-25T14:23:35  <antimatroid> you need a very zoned off corridor to block a 2 width passsage, and if you manage that in one game, meh

2011-03-25T14:43:28  <antimatroid> actually, i think these asymmetric maps are semi decent now that i've made it start more walks
2011-03-25T14:44:02  <antimatroid> generate it alongside the map analyzer and you can throw out maps where there's a "significant" difference in the number of squares players have "first access" to
2011-03-25T14:45:30  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/kaD94ihP
2011-03-25T14:45:35  <antimatroid> amstan: ^^ what do you think of those?
2011-03-25T14:46:04  <amstan> antimatroid: they seem more fair
2011-03-25T14:46:33  <antimatroid> yep, then once we start to work out what makes maps extremely unfair, the map analyzer can be made to try and reject them
2011-03-25T14:46:54  <amstan> antimatroid: maybe assymetric maps with 50% fair +-5% will be ok
2011-03-25T14:47:18  <amstan> people are really content for this it seems like
2011-03-25T14:48:54  <antimatroid> i don't really like it, but it does seem to be something people want so i'm willing to try
2011-03-25T14:49:33  <amstan> antimatroid: is food symmetric yet?
2011-03-25T14:49:40  <antimatroid> amstan: if you want it to be yes
2011-03-25T14:49:49  <antimatroid> i'm quite happy with the way it's done too
2011-03-25T14:49:50  <amstan> how is that implemented?
2011-03-25T14:51:26  <antimatroid> it's a little involved... each non-water square has a counter for the number of water squares waiting to spawn, each turn it picks a square and gets the symmetrically equivalent squares and increments those counters, then goes through and spawns food at a location with a positive "tospawn" counter while decrementing it if it doesn't contain an ant or food already
2011-03-25T14:51:49  <amstan> what if i have a line symmetric map?
2011-03-25T14:52:03  <antimatroid> wont work, you'll need to use a different method
2011-03-25T14:52:11  <amstan> where is this implemented?
2011-03-25T14:52:15  <antimatroid> this method is strictly for my symmetric map gen
2011-03-25T14:52:19  <antimatroid> in ants.py
2011-03-25T14:52:29  <amstan> you should move this to the mapgen
2011-03-25T14:52:34  <amstan> since it's technically related
2011-03-25T14:52:36  <antimatroid> it's part of the engine
2011-03-25T14:52:46  <amstan> yes, but food spawning is part of the mapgen
2011-03-25T14:52:50  <amstan> since it depends on the type of map
2011-03-25T14:52:50  <antimatroid> no it's not
2011-03-25T14:52:55  <janzert> food spawning is the engine
2011-03-25T14:52:55  <antimatroid> i was told to leave it separate
2011-03-25T14:53:10  <janzert> it's done during the game not at map creation time
2011-03-25T14:53:16  <antimatroid> we may need to mark the maps later with a parameter so the engine knows what spawn method to use
2011-03-25T14:53:31  <antimatroid> in fact we should do that now
2011-03-25T14:53:35  <antimatroid> McLeopold: ^^
2011-03-25T14:53:49  <amstan> antimatroid: you should still separate the food spawning method from the engine
2011-03-25T14:54:02  <antimatroid> amstan: food spawning is done through the game, you can't
2011-03-25T14:54:09  <amstan> antimatroid: since there's multiple methods, and it highly depends on the mapgen
2011-03-25T14:54:18  <amstan> antimatroid: import antimatroidfoodspawn
2011-03-25T14:54:25  <antimatroid> it's not my area, talk to mcleopold and sigh
2011-03-25T14:54:31  <amstan> ok
2011-03-25T14:54:56  <amstan> i just don't want to have another of those cases where we can't change our map gen
2011-03-25T14:55:06  <antimatroid> janzert: i think you're about as skeptical about asymmetric maps as me, what do you think of the last link i gave?

2011-03-25T14:55:28  <antimatroid> amstan: the plan is to log the maps in a lot sooner, but not necessarily right away
2011-03-25T14:55:33  <antimatroid> lock*
2011-03-25T14:55:35  <amstan> antimatroid: for those asymmetric maps you should also look at the food spawn, random food spawns won't be fair either
2011-03-25T14:55:52  <antimatroid> amstan: random food spawn with be a lot like above
2011-03-25T14:56:12  <antimatroid> but find the "first reachable squares" for each player, then spawn a food square in each set each turn
2011-03-25T14:56:18  <antimatroid> that isn't done yet
2011-03-25T14:56:31  <amstan> yes, but in one case you get a food 1 block from a red ant and then 10 blocks from a blue ant
2011-03-25T14:56:35  <amstan> won't really be fair for the blue
2011-03-25T14:56:43  <antimatroid> no it wont, but that's the best i've got
2011-03-25T14:56:53  <antimatroid> the other method is to further split them up on distance from the ant?
2011-03-25T14:57:04  <antimatroid> then pick a distance and loc from that distance
2011-03-25T14:57:09  <amstan> ok
2011-03-25T14:57:21  <antimatroid> the other method being the one i just made up for you :P
2011-03-25T14:58:32  <antimatroid> that's probably the best way to do it i think
2011-03-25T14:58:36  <antimatroid> i'll get sigh onto implementing that
2011-03-25T15:11:34  <janzert> antimatroid: I'm pretty sure at this point I can't tell by looking at an asymmetric map whether it will be fair or horribly lopsided and until I start seeing fairly decent bots playing them I don't think there's a way that I will learn
2011-03-25T15:11:59  <antimatroid> janzert: they still look a lot more fair than any other asymmetric maps i've seen yet
2011-03-25T15:12:30  <antimatroid> i'm working on cleaning it up now so i can generate maps and put stuff up on git, so there's both symmetric and asymmetric stuff there
2011-03-25T15:13:19  <antimatroid> one issue with my maps is the number of players divides the number of rows and columns
2011-03-25T15:13:35  <janzert> hmm, just had a thought don't know if it's any good but...
2011-03-25T15:13:35  <janzert> what if you carved out an asymmetric map with a random walk, then placed the start positions to try and balance the first reachable territory of each player?

2011-03-25T15:14:24  <antimatroid> it's been mentioned before, i don't really know how to get that finishing bit though
2011-03-25T15:14:43  <antimatroid> i guess you just start walking the ants on the extreme?
2011-03-25T15:14:49  <antimatroid> until you get close to equal?
2011-03-25T15:15:10  <janzert> or walk the neighbors of the largest area in
2011-03-25T15:15:19  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-25T15:15:19  <janzert> something like that anyway yea

2011-03-25T15:16:02  <antimatroid> i think it'd be best to start from these maps anyway
2011-03-25T15:16:08  <antimatroid> because it'd be somewhat close already
2011-03-25T15:18:44  <antimatroid> if we don't use no_players == 7 or 9, then for players 2-10 if the dimensions are 120x120 (or 240etc.) then people can't deduce information about the number of players (and narrow down row_t, col_t) from the dimensions of the map

2011-03-25T16:24:58  <jmcarthur> sounds about right for java, yes
2011-03-25T16:25:03  <Frontier> Well, it is the JavaScript compiler that acts stupidly. If they cannot return the raw data type and have to wrap it, the semantics still have to work as expected.
2011-03-25T16:25:14  <jmcarthur> oh it's javascript
2011-03-25T16:25:29  <jmcarthur> amazing
2011-03-25T16:26:29  <Frontier> Rhino from Mozilla is a JavaScript runtime they developed for Jagator, their Java browser. The browser project doesn't exist any more, but Rhino had some success none the less.
2011-03-25T16:27:47  <Frontier> I'll try a more reduced test with a simple "function x() { return false } if (x()) { alert('*doh*') }"

2011-03-25T16:45:05  <Stocha> It should be out of the game engine. Or at least easy to modify and plug a new one. You'll need that for testing purpose. In java you would like to put it in an independant .jar. And then you can switch the .jar with a new one at testing time :p

2011-03-25T17:18:51  <Frontier> "if (new Boolean(false))" is supposed to yield true according to ECMAScript. Then again the browsers don't respect this rule and handle it like the primitive type boolean. But the browsers also always return the primitive type on a "return false". So I guess I'll file a bug report.
2011-03-25T17:20:02  <Frontier> Rhino should not wrap a simple return false into an Object, or if that is not possible add a flag for the interpreter to know which semantic to apply

2011-03-25T18:19:24  <Frontier> looks like the 'bug' is provoked by me using the functionality to wrap a JS object into a Java-object implementing an interface. While this is great to get around the extremly cryptical way to call functions in JS from Java it obviously changes return values of functions from their raw types into wrapper objects.

2011-03-25T21:22:01  <sigh> what do you propose?
2011-03-25T21:22:40  <antimatroid> basically, partition the squares, but for each players "first reachable squares" also partition those into how many turns they can be reached in, then randomly pick a distance to place a food square from each players starting position each turn and one of the squares at that distance to place it
2011-03-25T21:22:47  <antimatroid> with a similar "to spawn counter" as with symmetric
2011-03-25T21:23:39  <antimatroid> janzert also suggested tweaking the starting positions to try and get the "first reachable" sets more even
2011-03-25T21:24:04  <sigh> i see

2011-03-25T21:42:41  <antimatroid> sigh: maybe it's not giving the first person you see as player 1 if you can see them at the start?
2011-03-25T21:42:50  <antimatroid> but instead their actual player number?
2011-03-25T21:43:49  <antimatroid> amstan: poo to them for it being a closed contest
2011-03-25T21:44:06  <amstan> antimatroid: go to the forums and check my post
2011-03-25T21:44:14  <amstan> antimatroid: that they ignored, for 1 week
2011-03-25T21:44:16  <amstan> lol
2011-03-25T21:44:32  <sigh> antimatroid: nah, it's doing that
2011-03-25T21:45:02  <sigh> although when you can see multiple players at the start, they are all equal, there is no "first"
2011-03-25T21:46:25  <antimatroid> errr?
2011-03-25T21:46:27  <antimatroid> isn't that bad?
2011-03-25T21:46:34  <sigh> maybe it should be randomised, when a single turn reveals multiple players
2011-03-25T21:46:57  <antimatroid> it doesn't really matter what you assign them, just make sure a player doesn't see two enemies as the same
2011-03-25T21:46:59  <antimatroid> that is a bug
2011-03-25T21:47:19  <sigh> oh, the player number are all different
2011-03-25T21:48:14  <sigh> antimatroid: my point is that the only possible bug is that the order *does* matter
2011-03-25T21:49:24  <sigh> for example if you can see all other players at the start, then each player gets shown the same order
2011-03-25T21:49:56  <antimatroid> yeah okay, i don't think that should really matter, but we'll have to wait for mcleopold
2011-03-25T21:50:27  <sigh> that's the only issue I can think of in the code *shrug*
2011-03-25T21:50:41  <sigh> I'll stop thinking about vague bug reports now :)
2011-03-25T21:51:32  <sigh> right now I want to fix the engine so that it can play deterministic games again
2011-03-25T21:54:36  <antimatroid> it can't?
2011-03-25T21:54:47  <antimatroid> sigh: i think people want to separate the engine and food spawning
2011-03-25T21:54:49  <antimatroid> i have no idea how
2011-03-25T21:55:04  <antimatroid> i was thinking.. what if the map generators chose the food spawning for a map?
2011-03-25T21:55:21  <antimatroid> like the whole map, so you got the same food spawning for each map always
2011-03-25T21:55:55  <sigh> that might be an idea
2011-03-25T21:56:13  <antimatroid> the only problem there is how much extra data that is
2011-03-25T21:57:00  <sigh> you have an extra key value pair in the map file?
2011-03-25T21:57:32  <antimatroid> key value?
2011-03-25T21:58:05  <sigh> like start the file with: rows 5\ncols 6\nfood sections\n
2011-03-25T22:02:48  <sigh> antimatroid: well, at the moment the engine itself is functionally deterministic, but the order that it outputs data in is not
2011-03-25T22:03:17  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-03-25T22:03:19  <sigh> which causes some of the sample_ants to behave differently, causing different games for the same random seed
2011-03-25T22:03:36  <antimatroid> yep

2011-03-25T23:01:58  <Frontier> Is it available on everyone's computers?
2011-03-25T23:02:07  <amstan> idk
2011-03-25T23:02:11  <amstan> what do you mean?
2011-03-25T23:02:24  <Frontier> Is ant installed on a typical Ubuntu dev machine
2011-03-25T23:02:27  <amstan> i can apt-get it if that's what you mean
2011-03-25T23:02:29  <amstan> no, it's not
2011-03-25T23:02:31  <amstan> but it's in the repo
2011-03-25T23:02:39  <amstan> feel free to use it, this is java
2011-03-25T23:02:54  <amstan> and it'll probably fix your plugin.jar thing
2011-03-25T23:04:18  <Frontier> ok. I literally have every build tool on my computer, because Gentoo is a source distribution. :p

2011-03-25T23:37:01  <antimatroid> what are you doing?
2011-03-25T23:37:13  <amstan> the maze bot thingy
2011-03-25T23:37:20  <antimatroid> yeah, what are you doing?
2011-03-25T23:37:29  <amstan> just implemented trimeaux
2011-03-25T23:37:33  <amstan> but it still gets lonst

2011-03-25T23:46:14  <sigh> McLeopold: yeah, I though that was your issue... you want them to be randomised? because they are all seen at the same time
2011-03-25T23:46:24  <antimatroid> Frontier: you had to put me as the shit bot :(
2011-03-25T23:46:35  <sigh> McLeopold: I suppose we can also do it by distance
2011-03-25T23:46:39  <Frontier> lol
2011-03-25T23:46:59  <McLeopold> well, you at least need to be given your ants, test_bot is a 2 player game
2011-03-25T23:47:00  <sigh> I wasn't even good enough to make the game :P
2011-03-25T23:47:01  <Frontier> I thought I would be an honor for you to be named
2011-03-25T23:47:20  <antimatroid> :P i'm kidding
2011-03-25T23:47:39  <sigh> McLeopold: oh, right... your own ants are supposed to be 0
2011-03-25T23:47:43  <sigh> yeah?
2011-03-25T23:48:04  <Frontier> I feel like I need a break. Pushing Rhino is exausting.
2011-03-25T23:48:36  <McLeopold> sigh: yes, that's the issue
2011-03-25T23:48:49  <sigh> ok, cool... I overlooked that, will fix
2011-03-25T23:49:24  <sigh> McLeopold: also, I re-wrote parse_orders so that ALL the validation is done in there, since that what the interface you designed seems to to want
2011-03-25T23:49:27  <sigh> what do you think
2011-03-25T23:49:28  <sigh> ?
2011-03-25T23:50:01  <sigh> I also moved ALL the logic for moving ants into do_orders (renamed from resolve_orders)
2011-03-25T23:50:20  <sigh> got rid of Ant.move as well :)
2011-03-25T23:50:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: people want to move food spawning out of the engine
2011-03-25T23:56:42  <sigh> antimatroid: who are people?
2011-03-25T23:57:37  <janzert> not me, I think it fits in the engine perfectly well :)

2011-03-25T23:59:22  <McLeopold> antimatroid: by people you mean amstan, and no
2011-03-25T23:59:39  <McLeopold> although a map could flag a preference for a generation type, but that's it
2011-03-25T23:59:53  <amstan> McLeopold: hmm?
