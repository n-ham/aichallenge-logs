2012-09-03T09:02:53  <mcstar> yeah?
2012-09-03T09:02:56  <antimatroidl> tried installing ubuntu 3 times already tonight without it working
2012-09-03T09:03:02  <antimatroidl> just put an old 300gb ide drive in
2012-09-03T09:03:05  <antimatroidl> will see how that goes
2012-09-03T09:03:22  <antimatroidl> hopefully i'm not just a complete tard :P
2012-09-03T09:03:23  <mcstar> you know, you dont have to install an os to figure out if your hdd is working or not
2012-09-03T09:03:38  <antimatroidl> yeah, well disk checks were working fine
2012-09-03T09:03:46  <antimatroidl> but then it stopped booting just before
2012-09-03T09:03:46  <mcstar> what kind?
2012-09-03T09:03:53  <antimatroidl> ubuntu installer cd one
2012-09-03T09:04:06  <mcstar> what kind of disk check?
2012-09-03T09:04:16  <antimatroidl> no idea
2012-09-03T09:04:26  <mcstar> ' disk checks were working fine'
2012-09-03T09:04:29  <mcstar> you said that
2012-09-03T09:04:29  <antimatroidl> i ran the disk check and memory check the ubuntu installer cd had
2012-09-03T09:04:34  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-03T09:04:35  <antimatroidl> i don't know what they actually did

2012-09-03T09:06:04  <mcstar> there is a util, that writes and re-reads the disk
2012-09-03T09:06:07  <antimatroidl> he just didn't finish installing arch that night, he's got it now
2012-09-03T09:06:08  <mcstar> checks for errors

2012-09-03T09:07:28  <antimatroidl> i am sick of osx
2012-09-03T09:07:32  <antimatroidl> i want ubuntu back aha
2012-09-03T09:08:52  <mcstar> i think it was called testdisk
2012-09-03T09:09:30  <mcstar> nah
2012-09-03T09:09:37  <mcstar> badblcoks
2012-09-03T09:09:41  <mcstar> badblocks
2012-09-03T09:10:17  <mcstar> antimatroidl: ^^
2012-09-03T09:10:33  <mcstar> you can use badblocks to destructively check the whole surface of the disk
2012-09-03T09:11:10  <mcstar> but, if you managed to install ubuntu on it, i dont think there is actually anything wrong with it
2012-09-03T09:11:37  <antimatroidl> it never properly booted
2012-09-03T09:11:37  <mcstar> antimatroidl: whats the problem now? still doesnt boot, but otherwise ok?
2012-09-03T09:11:52  <antimatroidl> last time it looked like it, but nothing would open and it claimed a read only file system
2012-09-03T09:12:00  <antimatroidl> i'm installing onto the new hdd now
2012-09-03T09:12:05  <mcstar> antimatroidl: try booting the installed os with the cd's bootloader
2012-09-03T09:12:37  <antimatroidl> i'm in the middle of installing :|
2012-09-03T09:12:44  <antimatroidl> i disconnected the sata drive
2012-09-03T09:12:55  <antimatroidl> if this install works, i'm going to just assume the other drive is fucked
2012-09-03T09:13:06  <mcstar> but thats a wrong assumption
2012-09-03T09:13:17  <mcstar> when a drive becomes fucked, there are other signs
2012-09-03T09:13:28  <antimatroidl> why would it repeatedly fail to install ubuntu?
2012-09-03T09:13:34  <antimatroidl> it's not like i had any options to fuck it up
2012-09-03T09:13:36  <mcstar> 'it doesnt boot' is not a sign of a driven being fucked
2012-09-03T09:13:48  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you said you instlaled ubuntu
2012-09-03T09:13:51  <antimatroidl> yeah
2012-09-03T09:13:59  <antimatroidl> so why would it not work when it's finished?
2012-09-03T09:14:00  <mcstar> then dont say, it failed to install it
2012-09-03T09:14:12  <antimatroidl> well, it says it installed it, but it never booted and worked properly
2012-09-03T09:14:19  <mcstar> ok, thats different
2012-09-03T09:14:31  <antimatroidl> i've been saying this for 2 days :|
2012-09-03T09:14:34  <mcstar> antimatroidl: what was the previous os on that disk?
2012-09-03T09:14:42  <antimatroidl> the new one?
2012-09-03T09:14:44  <mcstar> no
2012-09-03T09:14:50  <antimatroidl> oh, ubuntu
2012-09-03T09:15:27  <mcstar> why did you want another os?
2012-09-03T09:15:41  <mcstar> what motivated you to install debian?
2012-09-03T09:16:00  <antimatroidl> remember my compiler somehow f'd itself? so i decided it was a good time to format
2012-09-03T09:16:05  <antimatroidl> then decided to try debian
2012-09-03T09:16:09  <antimatroidl> then this whole mess happened
2012-09-03T09:16:12  <mcstar> aha
2012-09-03T09:16:33  <mcstar> antimatroidl: when i say aha, its an acknowledgement, not haha
2012-09-03T09:16:42  <mcstar> just to remind you :)
2012-09-03T09:17:24  <mcstar> antimatroidl: well, tell me how the installation goes
2012-09-03T09:17:44  <mcstar> or, if you havent done the formatting, ill want to know what you do
2012-09-03T09:18:42  <antimatroidl> me done the formatting?
2012-09-03T09:18:50  <antimatroidl> http://pastebin.com/D6bSCbv7
2012-09-03T09:18:53  <antimatroidl> there's something for you then
2012-09-03T09:19:03  <antimatroidl> my product tables for F_4 and F_5
2012-09-03T09:19:20  <mcstar> stupid character tables
2012-09-03T09:19:37  <mcstar> that reminds me of them
2012-09-03T09:20:16  <mcstar> antimatroidl: if i knew the algorithm of calculating the product, id write up an program too
2012-09-03T09:20:24  <mcstar> but i didnt want to reverse engineer your c++
2012-09-03T09:20:32  <mcstar> (and as usual, im busy too)
2012-09-03T09:21:18  <mcstar> antimatroidl: anyway, back to installation, have you done the formatting or not?
2012-09-03T09:21:26  <mcstar> if not, i want you to do it manually
2012-09-03T09:21:33  <mcstar> dont let the stupid installer handle it
2012-09-03T09:21:40  <antimatroidl> i'll do it manually if this fails
2012-09-03T09:21:46  <antimatroidl> it's like mostly done
2012-09-03T09:22:11  <mcstar> antimatroidl: then, will do a manual partitioning on the old disk after this is installed, ok?
2012-09-03T09:22:15  <mcstar> we will*
2012-09-03T09:22:41  <antimatroidl> hmm okay

2012-09-03T10:18:52  <Areks> Hello all. Can somebody help me. How i can use bot on java? I cant understand: when i run two test bot on python it works, when i try to run java bot it didn't work
2012-09-03T10:19:48  <Areks> "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\python\HunterBot.py""" "java -jar .\sample_bots\java\HunterBot.java"  first is python, second java
2012-09-03T10:27:07  <mcstar> whats with those quotes?
2012-09-03T10:27:24  <mcstar> anyway, how does it not work?
2012-09-03T10:27:50  <mcstar> the fix is probably to use full path
2012-09-03T10:27:59  <mcstar> at least, this issue came up a lot iirc
2012-09-03T10:28:34  <mcstar> Areks: .java is not a jar file
2012-09-03T10:28:49  <mcstar> you compile .java sources to .class files
2012-09-03T10:28:59  <mcstar> and after that i think with some magic you can make a jar out of it
2012-09-03T10:29:03  <mcstar> i not a java guru
2012-09-03T10:29:15  <mcstar> but you dont need to provide a jar
2012-09-03T10:29:21  <Areks> mcstar: yepá i already saw it )
2012-09-03T10:29:49  <mcstar> java -cp fullpathtoclassfiles MainClassName
2012-09-03T10:29:52  <Areks> mcstar: u mean i can compile when start bot?
2012-09-03T10:29:55  <mcstar> Areks: use it like that ^^
2012-09-03T10:30:09  <mcstar> Areks: no, compile before you start the bot obviously
2012-09-03T10:30:35  <mcstar> jvm does jit, but that doesnt mean it compiles your sources on the fly
2012-09-03T10:30:47  <mcstar> you compile the sources to java bytecode, .class files
2012-09-03T10:30:58  <mcstar> and the jit will do whatever it wants with those at runtime

2012-09-03T10:41:53  <antilame> yeah but i suck with them
2012-09-03T10:41:53  <mcstar> maybe osx has nano
2012-09-03T10:42:09  <mcstar> anyway, why osx?
2012-09-03T10:42:10  <antilame> how do i get to ~/.bashrc from the gui? :P

2012-09-03T10:52:47  <antilame> the two relevant parts just link back to each other

2012-09-03T10:53:40  <antilame> what do you mean by ap to associate with ifconfig?
2012-09-03T10:53:54  <mcstar> iwconfig
2012-09-03T10:54:06  <mcstar> association is the process of the card selecting an ap to talk to
2012-09-03T10:54:14  <mcstar> ap is access point
2012-09-03T10:54:19  <mcstar> the wireless router
2012-09-03T10:54:29  <mcstar> it has a mac address
2012-09-03T10:54:41  <mcstar> you can either use that, or the name of the network it provides
2012-09-03T10:54:45  <mcstar> called essid

2012-09-03T10:55:27  <mcstar> essid
2012-09-03T10:56:05  <antilame> i have an ssid and a bssid

2012-09-03T10:56:50  <mcstar> there is difference between them, i dont know what
2012-09-03T10:57:11  <mcstar> well, its the name you gave to it

2012-09-03T10:59:03  <mcstar> ill troubleshoot this
2012-09-03T10:59:12  <mcstar> probably it will solve yours too
2012-09-03T10:59:21  <mcstar> antilame: dial up a bit your signal streangth

2012-09-03T11:12:04  <mcstar> i think my adapter must support scanning
2012-09-03T11:12:11  <mcstar> but it doesnt seem to
2012-09-03T11:12:16  <mcstar> im trying to solve that

2012-09-03T11:37:21  <mcstar> probably you will need a reboot, since you cannot remmod b43 as long as the card is online
2012-09-03T11:37:47  <mcstar> there is a file around /etc/modprobe.d , either a dedicated blacklist file
2012-09-03T11:37:50  <mcstar> or a .conf file

2012-09-03T12:17:57  <mcstar> ok, whatever
2012-09-03T12:18:15  <mcstar> what is more important is knowing what your ap is called
2012-09-03T12:18:28  <mcstar> and what kind of authentication you set up with it
2012-09-03T12:20:47  <antilame> i'm in the network setup thing
2012-09-03T12:20:52  <antilame> but not really sure what i'm looking for?
2012-09-03T12:21:48  <antilame> wait
2012-09-03T12:21:49  <mcstar> antilame: the router's setup page?
2012-09-03T12:22:10  <antilame> WPA2-PSK (best) is that relevant?
2012-09-03T12:22:17  <mcstar> it is
2012-09-03T12:22:22  <mcstar> where do you see that?
2012-09-03T12:23:12  <antilame> under security in wireless
2012-09-03T12:24:01  <antilame> i don't see anything useful under the quick set up part or advanced set up
2012-09-03T12:24:21  <antilame> unless PPPoE is helpful
2012-09-03T12:24:21  <mcstar> antilame: ok, but on the ubuntu pc, or the router's config page?
2012-09-03T12:24:43  <mcstar> how did you connect to your router before?
2012-09-03T12:24:57  <antilame> before being when?
2012-09-03T12:25:00  <mcstar> did you have authentication? or was it an open network?
2012-09-03T12:25:06  <antilame> this is all coming from the router's config page
2012-09-03T12:25:09  <mcstar> before you reinstalled your os
2012-09-03T12:25:25  <antilame> it was no different to now
2012-09-03T12:25:33  <mcstar> which is what?
2012-09-03T12:25:40  <antilame> what?
2012-09-03T12:25:41  <mcstar> is it wpa2 authenticated?
2012-09-03T12:25:44  <antilame> yes
2012-09-03T12:25:57  <mcstar> ok, you will need to set up wpasuplicant
2012-09-03T12:26:01  <mcstar> wpasupplicant
2012-09-03T12:26:18  <antilame> ...
2012-09-03T12:26:39  <mcstar> antilame: im not familiar with the fancy gui connection managers
2012-09-03T12:26:49  <mcstar> last time i had to do it, i did it from the console
2012-09-03T12:27:07  <mcstar> but basically, just do it the last time you did it
2012-09-03T12:27:19  <mcstar> select the same encryption scheme as on the router
2012-09-03T12:27:25  <mcstar> and put your long key in it
2012-09-03T12:27:29  <mcstar> and it shoudl work..
2012-09-03T12:27:59  <mcstar> the problem that concerned me, is that the card wasnt able to scan the networks
2012-09-03T12:28:05  <antilame> it says it's installed
2012-09-03T12:28:08  <mcstar> and mine neither, but its a pretty new chipset
2012-09-03T12:28:09  <antilame> but i dunno where to find it :|
2012-09-03T12:28:37  <mcstar> (i bought this for my mother's laptop, so i never had to use it on linux)
2012-09-03T12:29:15  <mcstar> antilame: ubuntu has some network manager which im absolutely not familiar with
2012-09-03T12:29:23  <mcstar> all these fancy distros have them
2012-09-03T12:31:03  <antilame> what do i put as device and clone MAC?
2012-09-03T12:31:15  <antilame> are they for the router and/or pc?
2012-09-03T12:31:34  <mcstar> you dont want to clone mac
2012-09-03T12:31:46  <mcstar> can you make a screenshot?
2012-09-03T12:33:20  <antilame> i'm not really sure what i'm doing
2012-09-03T12:35:20  <mcstar> yay
2012-09-03T12:35:29  <mcstar> finally i could scan
2012-09-03T12:35:32  <antilame> it wont let me take a screen shot when i have a menu window open
2012-09-03T12:35:37  <mcstar> but i dont understand
2012-09-03T12:35:44  <mcstar> i up'ed my interface before
2012-09-03T12:35:50  <mcstar> and i stilll couldnt scan
2012-09-03T12:36:10  <antilame> i still have "Wireless networks" blacked out in the menu on the top right and "device not ready (firmware missing" below it
2012-09-03T12:36:20  <mcstar> antilame: sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2012-09-03T12:36:43  <antilame> sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2012-09-03T12:36:46  <antilame> oops
2012-09-03T12:36:56  <antilame> SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such file or directory
2012-09-03T12:37:17  <mcstar> hm
2012-09-03T12:37:23  <mcstar> does iwconfig still list it?
2012-09-03T12:37:57  <antilame> ihttp://sprunge.us/QZWS that?
2012-09-03T12:38:10  <antilame> http://sprunge.us/QZWS **
2012-09-03T12:38:20  <mcstar> aha
2012-09-03T12:38:41  <mcstar> thats not too good if ifconfig cant access the device
2012-09-03T12:39:23  <antilame> should i just go buy a new wireless card tomorrow morning?
2012-09-03T12:39:48  <antilame> it's 2:40am :|
2012-09-03T12:40:34  <mcstar> it worked before, so it should now too
2012-09-03T12:40:44  <antilame> it was an older version of ubuntu
2012-09-03T12:40:51  <mcstar> i think you need that b43-legacy module
2012-09-03T12:41:00  <antilame> how do i get it?
2012-09-03T12:41:01  <mcstar> sudo modprobe b43-legacy
2012-09-03T12:41:10  <mcstar> antilame: you said before you installed it
2012-09-03T12:41:16  <mcstar> though, i think it came already with the kernel
2012-09-03T12:41:20  <antilame> FATAL: Module b43_legacy not found.
2012-09-03T12:41:26  <mcstar> sudo modprobe b43legacy
2012-09-03T12:41:27  <antilame> i said i think i installed something similar
2012-09-03T12:41:58  <antilame> it didn't come up with anything then?
2012-09-03T12:42:38  <mcstar> antilame: did you try it wo the dash?
2012-09-03T12:42:59  <antilame> http://pastebin.com/qsAyTNmA
2012-09-03T12:43:45  <mcstar> antilame: just tell me, it didnt complain
2012-09-03T12:43:52  <mcstar> thats the sign of no error
2012-09-03T12:43:57  <mcstar> so you loaded the module
2012-09-03T12:44:04  <antilame> [02:40] <antilame> it didn't come up with anything then?
2012-09-03T12:44:24  <mcstar> antilame: there was a question mark at the end
2012-09-03T12:44:28  <antilame> i did tell you it didn't complain in a roundabout way :P
2012-09-03T12:44:29  <mcstar> did really know what it meant
2012-09-03T12:44:37  <antilame> yeah, i didn't really know what that meant
2012-09-03T12:44:37  <mcstar> didnt*
2012-09-03T12:44:53  <antilame> so, now what? :)
2012-09-03T12:45:00  <mcstar> antilame: the problem is that b43 is already loaded for that card
2012-09-03T12:45:07  <mcstar> thats why we tried to blackslist it
2012-09-03T12:46:29  <antilame> is there a way to unload b43?
2012-09-03T12:46:39  <mcstar> rmmod b43
2012-09-03T12:46:41  <mcstar> rmmod ssb
2012-09-03T12:46:47  <mcstar> rmmod b43legacy
2012-09-03T12:46:53  <mcstar> if you can do it..
2012-09-03T12:47:12  <mcstar> and after that modprobe b43legacy
2012-09-03T12:47:54  <antilame> done
2012-09-03T12:48:28  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-03T12:48:33  <mcstar> sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2012-09-03T12:48:47  <mcstar> and check with iwconfig if wlan0 is present
2012-09-03T12:48:59  <antilame> first one didn't work
2012-09-03T12:49:27  <mcstar> same error as before?
2012-09-03T12:49:35  <antilame> yep
2012-09-03T12:49:39  <antilame> same output with the second one too
2012-09-03T12:49:46  <mcstar> what does ifconfig -a give?

2012-09-03T13:10:45  <mcstar> well you should get your card to work with he legacy module
2012-09-03T13:10:51  <antimatroidl> but i couldn't sit out there anymore
2012-09-03T13:11:11  <antimatroidl> too cold, too boring, and too much effort to fix shit up if i stayed there longer

2012-09-03T13:13:17  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you have to make sure, that b43 is not loaded, (lsmod) and b43legacy is, and lspci -v lists b43legacy as the driver in use with the chipset
2012-09-03T13:13:21  <mcstar> thats my recipe
2012-09-03T13:13:46  <mcstar> if after that, ifconfig still cant up the card, im not sure what to do
2012-09-03T13:14:10  <antimatroidl> what is b43 and b43legacy anyway? and what's lsmod and lspci?
2012-09-03T13:14:24  <mcstar> it usually happens when a wrong dirver is loaded or the firmware is wrong or the card is broken
2012-09-03T13:14:37  <mcstar> lsmod and lspci a command
2012-09-03T13:14:45  <mcstar> lsmod lists the loaded kernel modules
2012-09-03T13:15:03  <mcstar> lspci lists the devices connected on the motherboard's pci lane
2012-09-03T13:15:18  <mcstar> b43 and b43legacy are the shorthands for kernel module files
2012-09-03T13:15:33  <mcstar> modules are extensions to a monolithic kernel
2012-09-03T13:15:44  <mcstar> like drivers on windows
2012-09-03T13:16:03  <mcstar> little programs that provide a common file interface for the kernel to the deivde
2012-09-03T13:16:05  <mcstar> device*
2012-09-03T13:16:13  <antimatroidl> okay, that makes some more sense
2012-09-03T13:16:24  <antimatroidl> can you take control of my computer remotely?
2012-09-03T13:16:34  <antimatroidl> not now obviously, but if i'm still up shit creak without a paddle tomorrow night
2012-09-03T13:16:35  <mcstar> me or generally someone?
2012-09-03T13:16:44  <antimatroidl> well, you, but that requires the later
2012-09-03T13:17:01  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i can if you provide a way for it
2012-09-03T13:17:11  <mcstar> i cant hack it if thats what you mean
2012-09-03T13:17:21  <antimatroidl> yeah i mean will it work
2012-09-03T13:17:25  <mcstar> if no services are running on your part i cant connect to it
2012-09-03T13:17:40  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you want me to remotely fix your machine?
2012-09-03T13:17:41  <antimatroidl> i can forward ports easily enough, just not sure if it works easily across linux distros or whatever
2012-09-03T13:17:49  <mcstar> that doesnt matter
2012-09-03T13:17:53  <mcstar> ssh is universal
2012-09-03T13:17:58  <antimatroidl> mcstar: yes :P
2012-09-03T13:18:16  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i used to do that for that buddy of mine i keep talking about
2012-09-03T13:18:55  <antimatroidl> fix all the things
2012-09-03T13:19:17  <mcstar> fix even your algorithm, as an easter egg
2012-09-03T13:19:36  <antimatroidl> haha what's wrong with it?
2012-09-03T13:19:38  <antimatroidl> it works
2012-09-03T13:19:43  <antimatroidl> it counted F_10 for me
2012-09-03T13:19:52  <mcstar> you told me it gave a different answer than you got on paper
2012-09-03T13:20:10  <antimatroidl> nah i fixed that
2012-09-03T13:20:15  <antimatroidl> i missed something on paper

2012-09-03T13:37:57  <antimatroidl> mcstar: diagram wise or algorithm wise?
2012-09-03T13:38:18  <mcstar> likewise
2012-09-03T13:38:25  <mcstar> to reproduce it
2012-09-03T13:41:12  <antimatroidl> what?
2012-09-03T13:41:19  <antimatroidl> do you understand how it works diagram wise?
2012-09-03T13:42:15  <mcstar> i think you told me once
2012-09-03T13:42:21  <mcstar> antimatroidl: tell me algorithm wis
2012-09-03T13:42:22  <mcstar> e
2012-09-03T13:42:31  <mcstar> (likewise was a not-so-wise joke)
2012-09-03T13:43:18  <antimatroidl> http://sketchia.com/draw.html#r4LOUzf
2012-09-03T13:43:28  <antimatroidl> hopefully that reminds you how the product of diagrams works
2012-09-03T13:44:10  <antimatroidl> then for the product i just treat diagrams as normal graphs (where there's an edge if two nodes are connected by the same hyper-edge) and the new edges are from the top to bottom nodes where theres a path connecting them
2012-09-03T13:44:22  <antimatroidl> it's messy doing that though
2012-09-03T13:46:20  <mcstar> antimatroidl: ok, so this describes the prodcut
2012-09-03T13:46:24  <mcstar> whats the input?
2012-09-03T13:46:33  <mcstar> how do you represent the connections
2012-09-03T13:47:53  <antimatroidl> you mean a diagram?
2012-09-03T13:48:01  <mcstar> for each n_i theres an index set?
2012-09-03T13:48:06  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-03T13:48:25  <mcstar> i indexes the nodes
2012-09-03T13:49:00  <antimatroidl> i have a 2d 2xn vector of nodes
2012-09-03T13:49:25  <antimatroidl> and each node as a set of neighbours
2012-09-03T13:49:40  <antimatroidl> which is a pair of ints indexing an element of the 2d vector of nodes
2012-09-03T13:49:53  <antimatroidl> then when i do the product i merge it to a graph on 3xn nodes
2012-09-03T13:50:03  <antimatroidl> like i said, messy :P
2012-09-03T13:50:23  <mcstar> 2 vectors, for the 2 inputs, each of length n, and each node has an index set
2012-09-03T13:50:58  <mcstar> antimatroidl: why 3xn?
2012-09-03T13:51:37  <antimatroidl> look at the product i drew
2012-09-03T13:51:45  <mcstar> i am
2012-09-03T13:51:49  <mcstar> looking at it
2012-09-03T13:52:02  <mcstar> but i dont know why do you need 3 output vector
2012-09-03T13:52:04  <mcstar> s
2012-09-03T13:52:48  <mcstar> so?
2012-09-03T13:52:56  <antimatroidl> it's a graph on 3xn nodes
2012-09-03T13:53:04  <mcstar> no, after you merged it
2012-09-03T13:53:11  <mcstar> you have 2 vectors again
2012-09-03T13:53:14  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-03T13:53:18  <antimatroidl> but to do the product
2012-09-03T13:53:27  *** Garf <Garf!~Garf@78-22-80-252.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2012-09-03T13:53:35  <mcstar> 'when i do the product i merge it to a graph on 3xn nodes'
2012-09-03T13:53:37  <antimatroidl> i merge the two graphs into one 3xn graph, then get the product by finding the paths from the top to bottom etc.
2012-09-03T13:53:46  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-03T13:53:48  <antimatroidl> all in the * operator function
2012-09-03T13:53:54  <mcstar> ok, so whats the output?
2012-09-03T13:53:56  <mcstar> 2 vectors?
2012-09-03T13:54:08  <antimatroidl> another diagram
2012-09-03T13:54:21  <antimatroidl> i have a diagram struct which has a 2d vector of nodes
2012-09-03T13:54:32  <antimatroidl> so yeah pretty much
2012-09-03T13:55:05  <mcstar> antimatroidl: hm, by the way you describe it, the input and output diagrams are fundamentally different
2012-09-03T13:55:18  <mcstar> all your inputs are symmetric, but the product is not required to be
2012-09-03T13:56:21  <antimatroidl> why are the inputs symmetric?
2012-09-03T13:56:22  <mcstar> antimatroidl: or is that only a coincidence?
2012-09-03T13:56:26  <mcstar> they are
2012-09-03T13:56:31  <antimatroidl> the generators are
2012-09-03T13:56:44  <antimatroidl> but the semigroup they generate is not all symmetric elements
2012-09-03T13:56:44  <mcstar> ok, so you call the 1d vector of points a generator
2012-09-03T13:56:51  <antimatroidl> no
2012-09-03T13:56:52  <mcstar> you flip it
2012-09-03T13:56:57  <mcstar> and thats a diagram?
2012-09-03T13:57:00  <antimatroidl> no
2012-09-03T13:57:13  <mcstar> but thats the way it looks on the drawing
2012-09-03T13:57:18  <antimatroidl> the two diagrams in the product are two generators
2012-09-03T13:57:40  <antimatroidl> where you have three nodes connected above and below then the rest just straight lines
2012-09-03T13:57:41  <mcstar> antimatroidl: do you recognize, that the green and red input diagrams are symmetric?
2012-09-03T13:57:47  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-03T13:57:56  <antimatroidl> * is a unary operation on diagrams
2012-09-03T13:58:05  <antimatroidl> where d* is d flipped
2012-09-03T13:58:16  <antimatroidl> s* = s is the definition of s being a projection
2012-09-03T13:58:26  <antimatroidl> s^2 = s gives s being an idempotent
2012-09-03T14:00:06  <antimatroidl> my next steps are: 1. give a process to decompose a given diagram into generators (so that what i claim is the set of diagrams actually is, i've proven it's no bigger than what i claim it is), 2. work out what |F_n| is for an arbitrary n, 3. classify the principle ideals 4. use the ideal structure to get green's relations, etc. etc.
2012-09-03T14:00:50  <antimatroidl> the program is just to help me calculate stuff to give me an idea of what to prove with that stuff

2012-09-03T14:03:32  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-03T14:03:35  <mcstar> but thats important
2012-09-03T14:04:12  <mcstar> antimatroidl: do you call the thing in red circle a diagram too, or only the thing in the red circle
2012-09-03T14:04:32  <mcstar> green*, the second one
2012-09-03T14:05:26  <antimatroidl> only the one in green
2012-09-03T14:05:31  <antimatroidl> it has to be on 2xn nodes
2012-09-03T14:05:35  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-03T14:05:42  <mcstar> thats where i was confused
2012-09-03T14:05:50  <mcstar> since then there are 4n input vectors
2012-09-03T14:05:51  <antimatroidl> and it has to be a product of those generators
2012-09-03T14:07:32  <antimatroidl> the diagrams you end up with are those in which the edges partition the nodes and for each edge if it connects n nodes at the top then the number of nodes it connects at the bottom is = n + 3b for some integer b
