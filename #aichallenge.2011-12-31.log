2011-12-31T12:31:49  <cseyu01> just learnt it
2011-12-31T12:32:18  <srgpqt> ah.
2011-12-31T12:32:25  <cseyu01> when I started with the tutorial, I couldn't get their java to run
2011-12-31T12:32:51  <cseyu01> and I wanted to start out cutting and pasting
2011-12-31T12:33:25  <cseyu01> I could probably speed it up by re-writing in c++
2011-12-31T12:33:41  <cseyu01> I think I have a solution for my map problem :)
2011-12-31T12:34:00  <srgpqt> in this challenge i've learned that you can get very good speed in most languages with good code
2011-12-31T12:34:05  <cseyu01> keep a static dictionary that's updated every 10 or 20 turns
2011-12-31T12:34:28  <cseyu01> and a dynamic one that my program can work on every turn

2011-12-31T12:36:57  <cseyu01> the numbering works really well when the map info is there, very easy to tell them, "go to the lowest numbered neighboring tile"
2011-12-31T12:37:35  <cseyu01> fails miserably when all neighbors have no value
2011-12-31T12:38:58  <srgpqt> yes, i do something similar in my bot, but i keep values for the entire map, and reuse the values from the previous turn...

2011-12-31T12:43:02  <srgpqt> i do this for a lot of my strategies, so for example after a few turns all of my ants (anywhere on the map) can go towards a discovered enemy hill just by looking up the neighboring tile map values
2011-12-31T12:43:52  <srgpqt> so it can handle 1000 ants almost as easily as it can handle 10 ants
2011-12-31T12:45:09  <cseyu01> wow
2011-12-31T12:46:44  <cseyu01> I noticed that when I went map based the processing times for the actual decisions went way down, but I've never had 1000 ants
2011-12-31T12:47:07  <cseyu01> I only leave 150ms for decisions
2011-12-31T12:47:21  <cseyu01> that's plenty of time for 400-500
2011-12-31T12:48:14  <srgpqt> i don't even keep track of turn time.. teehee

2011-12-31T13:05:15  <cseyu01> I think when you've explored alot more of the map it'll go up significantly
2011-12-31T13:05:38  <cseyu01> 58.4 on a big map?
2011-12-31T13:05:54  <srgpqt> 134x196 map
2011-12-31T13:06:00  <cseyu01> impressive
2011-12-31T13:06:10  <srgpqt> fully explored before the last turn
2011-12-31T13:06:59  <cseyu01> my food search takes long because I reset the values every turn
2011-12-31T13:07:31  <srgpqt> i reset food too, because they don't stay very long anyway, and i only want close ants to reach them
2011-12-31T13:07:39  <cseyu01> but I can still find 15 tile paths to food in under 100ms
2011-12-31T13:08:10  <cseyu01> do you store all the values seperately or combine scores?
2011-12-31T13:08:40  <cseyu01> i keep seperate dictionaries and then convert to a score at decision time
2011-12-31T13:08:59  <cseyu01> i think some ppl just say this tile has x score
2011-12-31T13:09:21  <srgpqt> i have separate maps for combined food, combined enemy hills

2011-12-31T13:13:13  <srgpqt> i have a separate map for each of my hills too now (previously i didnt have any).. a map for exploration, a map for which tiles have been seen, a map for which tiles i've walked on before
2011-12-31T13:14:47  <cseyu01> i used to use a dictionary tracking how many times my ants have stepped on each tile
2011-12-31T13:15:28  <cseyu01> it helps avoid oscillation and get them to explore
2011-12-31T13:15:37  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: pong, but i'll brb
2011-12-31T13:16:28  <cseyu01> but I'd rather use more direct methods
2011-12-31T13:16:35  <srgpqt> i wonder what performance penalty you pay for using dictionaries instead of a list (or better yet, a true array from the array module)
2011-12-31T13:17:22  <cseyu01> not much difference in time when i loop thru lists dicts or sets
2011-12-31T13:18:22  <cseyu01> for storing whether or not a tile has been explored or if it's land or water i use lists
2011-12-31T13:18:59  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: alright, so what are you willing to change for optimization? functions only, or also data structures? there are tradeoffs, of course
2011-12-31T13:19:11  <cseyu01> but if I need to associate a value like the number of steps from a target I have to use a dict
2011-12-31T13:19:18  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: what are we talking about?
2011-12-31T13:19:29  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: that pastebin thing from days ago
2011-12-31T13:19:38  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: not sure if you even care anymore, but just following up
2011-12-31T13:19:41  <McLeopold> oh, haskell? :)
2011-12-31T13:19:45  <McLeopold> yes I do
2011-12-31T13:20:03  <McLeopold> I've since read that show should only be used to match read
2011-12-31T13:20:11  <jmcarthur> that's the ideal, yes
2011-12-31T13:20:12  <McLeopold> and that I should create render functions
2011-12-31T13:20:56  <McLeopold> so, my main question is, if I care about performance, what is the best way to do a matrix?
2011-12-31T13:21:03  <jmcarthur> aha
2011-12-31T13:21:10  <McLeopold> I would want to continually update values in it
2011-12-31T13:21:11  <jmcarthur> there are a few ways
2011-12-31T13:21:18  <jmcarthur> a list of lists is certainly the worst
2011-12-31T13:21:28  <McLeopold> also, what is the fastest way to print the map
2011-12-31T13:21:32  <jmcarthur> alright

2011-12-31T13:22:43  <jmcarthur> there are a few different array libraries. if you are willing to do some mind-bending, repa is pretty nice for higher dimensional arrays and if used intelligently will be very efficient

2011-12-31T13:23:16  <jmcarthur> there's also vector, which is for 1D arrays. to get a matrix, you will have to nest them. this isn't as fast as the unboxed representation you can get from repa
2011-12-31T13:23:45  <McLeopold> I did stumble upon repa
2011-12-31T13:23:48  <jmcarthur> on the other hand, using boxed vectors means it's easier to work with custom data types (no crazy type class instances for unboxing), and the elements can be lazy
2011-12-31T13:23:54  <McLeopold> I wasn't sure if it was overkill or not
2011-12-31T13:24:06  <jmcarthur> another way would be to nest a couple IntMaps
2011-12-31T13:24:18  <McLeopold> I'm thinking my Tile data type can't be used unboxed?
2011-12-31T13:24:27  <jmcarthur> which might sound weird, but it's actually pretty nice to work with since it's purely functional and not entirely too slow
2011-12-31T13:24:41  <jmcarthur> Tile can be unboxed, but it requires some prep work
2011-12-31T13:24:52  <jmcarthur> a lot of boilerplate to get there
2011-12-31T13:25:02  <McLeopold> the Hill constructor is different from the rest, it takes an Int
2011-12-31T13:25:17  <jmcarthur> another approach would be to use a hash table. unordered-containers has a decent purely functional one
2011-12-31T13:25:23  <jmcarthur> yeah, that would be fine
2011-12-31T13:25:32  <jmcarthur> the hash table means you can just has the coord
2011-12-31T13:25:36  <jmcarthur> *hash
2011-12-31T13:26:25  <jmcarthur> since there are a limited number of players, you could pack the whole thing into a little Word8 representation
2011-12-31T13:26:45  <jmcarthur> without even losing the pattern matching and stuff, thanks to the way the unboxing stuff works
2011-12-31T13:27:00  <srgpqt> i use 1d numeric vector without nesting (simply append each row linearly in the vector) in my (non-haskell) implementation
2011-12-31T13:27:17  <McLeopold> yea, I thought about doing it the way the starter bot did: data Tile = Land | Water | Enemy1 | Enemy2, but I'd rather have the Hill Player
2011-12-31T13:27:21  <jmcarthur> srgpqt: that's basically what repa does for you :)
2011-12-31T13:27:27  <srgpqt> neat
2011-12-31T13:27:41  *** deltree_ <deltree_!~chatzilla@97.104.16.141> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-31T13:28:12  <McLeopold> so if you Try and get map 3 4, it translate to map 3 * cols + 4?
2011-12-31T13:28:35  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: there's also the array package, which i don't really like much anymore, but it does allow you to index in interesting ways
2011-12-31T13:28:43  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-12-31T13:28:48  <McLeopold> so, about printing
2011-12-31T13:28:55  <jmcarthur> the thing with repa, though, is that it's meant to be used in a particular way
2011-12-31T13:28:57  <McLeopold> I'm assuming that my method is slow
2011-12-31T13:29:00  <jmcarthur> you don't really get direct mutation
2011-12-31T13:29:46  <jmcarthur> instead you are intended to use various folds and accumulations and stuff, and the mutation is performed under the hood. for some algorithms this probably doesn't work, so you'd have to extract the underlying unboxed vector representation and do the mutation yourself
2011-12-31T13:29:50  <McLeopold> Yeah, I would be doing a lot of direct mutation, I think.  The plan was to rewrite my cell_maze generator as an excersice in learning Haskell
2011-12-31T13:30:22  <jmcarthur> mutation is not necessary as often as you might think, but it's hard to wrap your head around some of the folds and slices you do instead with repa
2011-12-31T13:31:04  <McLeopold> is concatMap show row fast?  is there a better way?
2011-12-31T13:31:26  <jmcarthur> well, Strings in general are pretty slow
2011-12-31T13:31:34  <jmcarthur> since they are linked lists :(
2011-12-31T13:31:54  <jmcarthur> so there are two ways to go about this
2011-12-31T13:32:05  <McLeopold> I should be able to build it fairly fast, and print it at the same speed?
2011-12-31T13:32:20  <jmcarthur> you could go with a ByteString representation, or you could stick with String and do your best to optimize the render function
2011-12-31T13:32:27  <jmcarthur> which would be your preference?
2011-12-31T13:32:40  <McLeopold> idk yet
2011-12-31T13:32:44  <jmcarthur> k
2011-12-31T13:32:59  <jmcarthur> so, for your String representation...
2011-12-31T13:33:06  <McLeopold> I just didn't want to accidently create an O(n^2) algo
2011-12-31T13:34:07  <McLeopold> I didn't like my method of nested printing, because I would never just print 1 row only
2011-12-31T13:34:11  <jmcarthur> concatMap show  is not *terrible*. it's not going to be exponential
2011-12-31T13:35:14  <McLeopold> I would know my total string length up front
2011-12-31T13:35:18  <jmcarthur> "foo" ++ "bar" only has to rebuild the "foo" part.  concat ["foo", "bar", "baz"]  associates (++) to the right, so it won't rebuild the same parts over and over
2011-12-31T13:35:56  <McLeopold> so, using ByteString might be equivilant to a stringbuilder class?
2011-12-31T13:36:19  <jmcarthur> no, ByteString is just a more compact (sane) string type
2011-12-31T13:36:52  <jmcarthur> blaze-builder would give you something more like a stringbuilder class
2011-12-31T13:38:29  <jmcarthur> i would probably either use blaze-builder or, if i care *a whole lot* about speed, roll by own direct renderer into a mutable buffer
2011-12-31T13:38:39  <jmcarthur> blaze-builder would be much more idiomatic though
2011-12-31T13:39:03  <jmcarthur> i'm recommending ByteString instead of Text since you don't need unicode
2011-12-31T13:40:03  <jmcarthur> btw, there is a showList method of the Show type class that can be specialized on showing a list of values
2011-12-31T13:40:25  <McLeopold> ok
2011-12-31T13:41:02  <jmcarthur> anyway, i hope i have been helpful. my advice has been rather open-ended
2011-12-31T13:41:12  <jmcarthur> i have to go now
2011-12-31T13:41:12  <McLeopold> it has :)

2011-12-31T16:27:13  <UncleVasya> the answer for one fun problem.
2011-12-31T16:27:21  <UncleVasya> I saw your big number in above and decided you like this stuff.
2011-12-31T16:27:32  <mcstar> duh
2011-12-31T16:28:27  <ahow984_> mcstar: is there a mathematical way to solve this problem?
2011-12-31T16:28:46  <UncleVasya> I have this number in notepad that close to me.
2011-12-31T16:28:50  <mcstar> what is that criterion? mathematical?
2011-12-31T16:29:02  <ahow984_> as in not brute-forced
2011-12-31T16:29:30  <mcstar> the brute force solution takes thinking too
2011-12-31T16:29:35  <mcstar> ive got that first
2011-12-31T16:29:49  <mcstar> but for the required problem size, it is useless
2011-12-31T16:30:11  <mcstar> so theres 2 bits of thinking
2011-12-31T16:30:24  <mcstar> the first one to figure it out A solution
2011-12-31T16:30:33  <ahow984_> yeah
2011-12-31T16:30:35  <UncleVasya> mcstar: when you'll need your c++ knowledge?
2011-12-31T16:30:40  <UncleVasya> job interview or whatever
2011-12-31T16:30:44  <mcstar> yes
2011-12-31T16:30:45  <ahow984_> I thought I had it a smart mathematical way but I was way off
2011-12-31T16:31:09  <mcstar> i was thinking about a pure mathematical solution, like a formula
2011-12-31T16:31:20  <ahow984_> did you find one?
2011-12-31T16:31:21  <mcstar> but i couldnt bypass an enumeration pahse
2011-12-31T16:31:29  <mcstar> no
2011-12-31T16:31:41  <mcstar> btw, i did it in haskell
2011-12-31T16:31:44  <mcstar> the brute force one
2011-12-31T16:31:50  <mcstar> weeks ago
2011-12-31T16:31:59  <mcstar> when rwest first presented this
2011-12-31T16:32:01  <ahow984_> heh, fair enough
2011-12-31T16:32:08  <ahow984_> I didn't see it the first time
2011-12-31T16:32:10  <ahow984_> just now
2011-12-31T16:32:18  <mcstar> and i tried to make it better today, but i couldnt do it in haskell
2011-12-31T16:32:28  <mcstar> for the last step i needed mutable arrays
2011-12-31T16:32:40  <ahow984_> I think I have a (someway) smart way to do it with vectors in C++
2011-12-31T16:32:47  <mcstar> and its awkward for me to use that in haskell, so i did it in c++ instead
2011-12-31T16:32:55  <ahow984_> good choice ;)
2011-12-31T16:33:01  <mcstar> its under 100 lines

2011-12-31T16:34:55  <mcstar> i mean its better to figure it out yourself
2011-12-31T16:35:00  <ahow984_> yeah

2011-12-31T16:35:32  <ahow984_> I'm not good at recursion and was wondering if thats how you did it
2011-12-31T16:35:53  <mcstar> i heavily used recursion in the haskell solution
2011-12-31T16:36:05  <mcstar> (the cats out of the bag..)
2011-12-31T16:36:07  <ahow984_> ok

2011-12-31T16:36:26  <mcstar> but it implies that i dont use it anymore

2011-12-31T16:37:16  <mcstar> wrong
2011-12-31T16:37:24  <mcstar> do it the other way around
2011-12-31T16:37:29  <mcstar> have a solution first

2011-12-31T16:37:41  <ahow984_> or at least some way that doesn't involve me going through a 48*10 vector a couple of million times
2011-12-31T16:37:56  <mcstar> 48?
2011-12-31T16:38:01  <mcstar> theres no 48
