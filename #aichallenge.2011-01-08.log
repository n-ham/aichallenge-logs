2011-01-08T09:48:28  <jmcarthur> oh maybe it's on github or something... looking
2011-01-08T09:49:58  <jmcarthur> oh, it is, but only a readme
2011-01-08T09:52:21  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: my comments on ants were based off a convo with amstan on here earlier
2011-01-08T10:01:27  <jmcarthur> oh? i thought i had read most of the scrollback
2011-01-08T10:02:11  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: oh i found it
2011-01-08T10:02:28  <jmcarthur> yeah that sounds even more boring than the other ants game :P
2011-01-08T10:02:48  <antimatroid1> yeah
2011-01-08T10:02:55  <antimatroid1> is stratego on a discrete grid?
2011-01-08T10:02:59  <antimatroid1> or continuous?
2011-01-08T10:03:22  <jmcarthur> discrete grid, although i considered continuous
2011-01-08T10:03:29  <jmcarthur> continuous just makes things tougher in general
2011-01-08T10:03:32  <antimatroid1> continous would be cool
2011-01-08T10:03:35  <jmcarthur> collision detection and stuff
2011-01-08T10:04:04  <antimatroid1> i am maybe down for tron
2011-01-08T10:04:12  <jmcarthur> and really, even continuous has to be fixed point arithmetic, so it's just fine-grained discreteness
2011-01-08T10:04:17  <antimatroid1> but i am hesitant about removing walls from dead bikes/snakes
2011-01-08T10:04:48  <jmcarthur> IMO the wall removal is necessary to balance against the vision blocking and the additional walls due to the extra bikes
2011-01-08T10:05:05  <antimatroid1> what's the vision blocking?
2011-01-08T10:05:08  <jmcarthur> without it, vision would be blocked too much, and walls would build up too fast
2011-01-08T10:05:16  <jmcarthur> vision blocked by walls
2011-01-08T10:06:20  <antimatroid1> hmmm, that game is getting rather complicated
2011-01-08T10:06:39  <antimatroid1> 3v3 tron would provide an interesting game without vision blocking or wall removal
2011-01-08T10:06:54  <jmcarthur> i think the latter is the bigger problem with walls sticking around. six bikes means you get tons of walls and i'm afraid that it would turn into a contest to simply survive the longest
2011-01-08T10:07:15  <antimatroid1> it's not that simple when you need to fight for the best region
2011-01-08T10:07:18  <antimatroid1> larger maps can be used
2011-01-08T10:07:39  <jmcarthur> even the walls that don't disappear would divide the space up reasonably to keep things interesting
2011-01-08T10:07:53  <jmcarthur> i just like the idea that paths might be opened up when you kill an enemy or something
2011-01-08T10:08:26  <antimatroid1> it would certainly open up the number of options for a strategy
2011-01-08T10:08:30  <jmcarthur> it means that if two bots get tangled up in a spiral or something then the winner can still get out and help out your other bikes
2011-01-08T10:08:44  <jmcarthur> can *possibly* still get out
2011-01-08T10:08:54  <jmcarthur> it's still easy for another bike to block your escape
2011-01-08T10:09:19  <antimatroid1> possible, but a whole extra layer of working out moves/strategies
2011-01-08T10:10:02  <jmcarthur> mainly i wanted that feature so that there wouldn't be tons of instances of both players always losing bots at the same time
2011-01-08T10:10:19  <jmcarthur> nicer if there's a bigger chance of a survivor in each 1v1 submatch
2011-01-08T10:10:26  <antimatroid1> i don't think i really like limiting vision from walls :P
2011-01-08T10:11:03  <jmcarthur> the main reason i wanted that feature was to prevent simple game tree search
2011-01-08T10:11:17  <jmcarthur> even with 6 bikes in total, it's possible to search several plies
2011-01-08T10:11:24  <jmcarthur> without vision blocking
2011-01-08T10:11:47  <jmcarthur> and the vision blocking opens up real strategies as opposed to brute force
2011-01-08T10:11:54  <antimatroid1> yeah, but if you have wall removal, you really have more than just max 12 things to consider per node
2011-01-08T10:12:04  <antimatroid1> you're going to have to start picking and choosing which branches to follow
2011-01-08T10:12:05  <jmcarthur> it would make things that normally seem more "ad hoc" viable AI
2011-01-08T10:12:35  <jmcarthur> hmm?
2011-01-08T10:12:49  <antimatroid1> actually, i guess you don't
2011-01-08T10:12:53  <jmcarthur> wall removal is still a completely predictable occurrence
2011-01-08T10:12:57  <antimatroid1> just makes evaluation harde
2011-01-08T10:13:07  <jmcarthur> i don't think it really does
2011-01-08T10:13:27  <jmcarthur> it may mean that you can't prune quite as much because bots have more chances to live
2011-01-08T10:13:32  <jmcarthur> but only barely
2011-01-08T10:14:34  <antimatroid1> i still feel like my strategy will be a variation of my first tron bot
2011-01-08T10:14:43  <jmcarthur> even then, disappearing walls will usually only introduce little tunnels, so the search only has to go down that tunnel for quite some depth
2011-01-08T10:14:57  <jmcarthur> exactly. that's why the vision blocking is so critical
2011-01-08T10:15:14  <jmcarthur> it would render your previous strategy pretty moot, especially in combination with the 3v3 aspect
2011-01-08T10:16:15  <jmcarthur> disappearing walls will mean you are often faced with a decision of which tunnel to travel down, and you don't necessarily know which one is better because you can't tell what has happened since you last had vision on the other side
2011-01-08T10:16:18  <antimatroid1> i would probably just emulate their bot with a cheap move selection
2011-01-08T10:16:32  <antimatroid1> then continue as if i was given all information
2011-01-08T10:16:38  <jmcarthur> the idea is the maps would be large enough that there are many possibilities
2011-01-08T10:17:14  <antimatroid1> yes, but ideally you are going to try and emulate what they will have done
2011-01-08T10:17:25  <antimatroid1> one might even continue running their moves in the full game tree
2011-01-08T10:17:27  <jmcarthur> sure, but you don't want to just *assume* one branch
2011-01-08T10:17:44  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay, well i'd have fun writing a bot for that
2011-01-08T10:17:49  <jmcarthur> blocked vision means you can't really leave the root node of your tree
2011-01-08T10:18:00  <jmcarthur> until you observe which branches were taken by you opponent
2011-01-08T10:18:38  <antimatroid1> i can, i just need to make predictions
2011-01-08T10:18:48  <antimatroid1> run the game tree as normal, but then pick their move at the end of each turn
2011-01-08T10:18:50  <jmcarthur> right. predictions are hard :)
2011-01-08T10:18:55  <jmcarthur> eh
2011-01-08T10:19:03  <jmcarthur> you'd have to have some *awesome* predictions
2011-01-08T10:19:24  <antimatroid1> it'd just be the pre-existing game tree's prediction of their *best response* to my selected move
2011-01-08T10:19:31  <jmcarthur> imagine you haven't seen a bike in 10 moves. would your prediction really be good enough to have *any* idea of what they are up to and how they have changed the map?
2011-01-08T10:19:37  <antimatroid1> sure it wouldn't be right, but it'd be a cheap best prediction i'll get
2011-01-08T10:19:57  <antimatroid1> it wouldn't be very accurate, but i'd take that over anything else i suspect
2011-01-08T10:20:00  <jmcarthur> i think one could do better
2011-01-08T10:20:20  <antimatroid1> set of possible move strings?
2011-01-08T10:20:25  <jmcarthur> by keeping a more abstract idea of what could be happening, rather than overfitting to a game tree
2011-01-08T10:21:28  <jmcarthur> by turn X they could have blocked exit A, but turn Y they could have blocked exit B *unless* they blocked exit A, by turn Z they could have made it over to this corner here for an attack *and* blocked exit B, etc.
2011-01-08T10:21:40  <jmcarthur> but without deciding every single one of their moves
2011-01-08T10:22:08  <jmcarthur> it would have to be a probability game, too
2011-01-08T10:22:28  <antimatroid1> that might work if there were just a couple of open exits
2011-01-08T10:22:28  <jmcarthur> and other bikes could even try to bluff you into guessing what the hidden bikes are up to
2011-01-08T10:22:55  <jmcarthur> by pretending to try to block an exit from you (implying that they want you to take the other exit)
2011-01-08T10:23:10  <jmcarthur> your game tree search would fall for that
2011-01-08T10:23:13  <antimatroid1> i think the games will certainly look cool

2011-01-08T10:23:58  <jmcarthur> game trees will work great for the visible portions of the game
2011-01-08T10:24:19  <jmcarthur> i just think they would overfit if applied to hidden state
2011-01-08T10:26:01  <antimatroid1> how are you planning to pass information?
2011-01-08T10:26:18  <antimatroid1> the cheapest would be something like
2011-01-08T10:26:18  <antimatroid1> x y direction
2011-01-08T10:26:18  <antimatroid1> ...
2011-01-08T10:26:18  <antimatroid1> go
2011-01-08T10:26:26  <antimatroid1> then require people to store their own information
2011-01-08T10:26:40  <antimatroid1> wait, do r c not x y
2011-01-08T10:27:10  <antimatroid1> well, hypothetically :P
2011-01-08T10:27:20  <jmcarthur> something like that would work, yeah
2011-01-08T10:27:40  <jmcarthur> would still need to give a map on every turn since things can become visible over time
2011-01-08T10:27:48  <jmcarthur> to the bots, i mean
2011-01-08T10:28:18  <antimatroid1> oh, what do you think about maps possibly starting with bikes in forced separate regions? with the condition that each bike is always starting in a region with an enemy
2011-01-08T10:28:22  <jmcarthur> like, not only will bikes enter and leave your vision, but walls may "appear" as well because they were added while you weren't able to see
2011-01-08T10:28:44  <antimatroid1> it's fairly easy to have a map generator do all that
2011-01-08T10:28:49  <jmcarthur> that would be a way to degenerate the game to almost what it was like in the old version
2011-01-08T10:28:59  <jmcarthur> except running simultaneous games
2011-01-08T10:29:01  <antimatroid1> it wouldn't be like that for every game
2011-01-08T10:29:04  <jmcarthur> right
2011-01-08T10:29:12  <jmcarthur> it would be an interesting way to stress the bots :)
2011-01-08T10:29:12  <delt0r_> so any decisions on the game then?
2011-01-08T10:29:20  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: nope :P
2011-01-08T10:29:22  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: no decisions yet

2011-01-08T10:29:55  <antimatroid1> i don't think it would be a very interesting game

2011-01-08T10:30:00  <jmcarthur> dangit, i'm gonna make this thing my tron variant instead of my stratego idea
2011-01-08T10:30:09  <delt0r_> So i am really getting behind
2011-01-08T10:30:21  <jmcarthur> i'll keep the stratego stuff around, but i'll focus on tron

2011-01-08T10:31:09  <delt0r_> its a good game without perfect knowledge...
2011-01-08T10:31:12  <antimatroid1> i could do you a tron map gen in the next half an hour or so, but i couldn't knock up a starter bot til i got back
2011-01-08T10:31:47  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: the tron game doesn't have perfect knowledge either
2011-01-08T10:32:03  <delt0r_> perhaps a simultaneous turn version would be better.

2011-01-08T10:34:02  <antimatroid1> some of the maps were pretty dull, but i think a random map generator should be used in the future
2011-01-08T10:34:11  <antimatroid1> there were still starter maps in the final contest last time i think

2011-01-08T10:38:24  <jmcarthur> hard to follow
2011-01-08T10:38:27  <delt0r_> My RTS game has circular maps
2011-01-08T10:39:46  <delt0r_> I don't have a problem with following warping. Civilizations had it
2011-01-08T10:51:03  <jmcarthur> well i'm not too far from having the stratego-specific stuff done in this engine now anyway
2011-01-08T10:51:12  <jmcarthur> not that i will have an awesome visualizer for it or anything...
2011-01-08T10:52:05  <jmcarthur> no worries, i have the basic engine seperated from stratego anyway in a completely different library, so it should be easy to apply to many other games

2011-01-08T11:12:07  <antimatroid1> i say we make frontier and delt0r make visualisers
2011-01-08T11:14:01  <jmcarthur> well, it would be nice if i could include one with the engine since i'm going for kind of an all-inclusive thing
2011-01-08T11:14:26  <jmcarthur> the visualizer would be highly-game specific though
2011-01-08T11:15:35  <antimatroid1> anyway, i'm going to get some sleep
2011-01-08T11:15:53  <jmcarthur> including it means it would be nicest if it was in haskell, and i doubt many people would want to write one for me
2011-01-08T11:16:13  <jmcarthur> the worst thing about my language choice is probably that i won't get too many contributions from other people
2011-01-08T11:16:23  <antimatroid1> i'm still umming and arrring every time i play with haskell
2011-01-08T11:16:38  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to learn it though, i'm sick of c++
2011-01-08T11:16:52  <jmcarthur> yeah i would pick haskell over c++ almost any day
2011-01-08T11:17:15  <antimatroid1> if templates weren't so horrid, my life would be a lot easier
2011-01-08T11:17:29  <antimatroid1> i would also like better process support, should be able to treat it like a file stream :(
2011-01-08T11:17:36  <jmcarthur> the only reason i ever use c++ is if i have to use a c++ library. binding to c++ with any language isn't the most enjoyable thing because you usually have to make intermediate c wrapper functions :\
2011-01-08T11:18:26  <jmcarthur> or you have to arrange to link to mangled functions names and stuff
2011-01-08T11:19:03  <antimatroid1> will i cry at inefficiency of haskell compared to c++ if i try to write a bot in haskell?
2011-01-08T11:19:30  <antimatroid1> i have a feeling if i wrote such a thing i'd probably write it very non-functionally :P
2011-01-08T11:19:35  <jmcarthur> only if you don't have a clue what you're doing. i'm pretty good with haskell performance, so if you have any issues you can ask questions here
2011-01-08T11:19:55  <jmcarthur> or in #haskell
2011-01-08T11:20:21  <jmcarthur> the hardest things for newbies as far as efficiency goes is not introducing space leaks
2011-01-08T11:20:32  <antimatroid1> space leak?
2011-01-08T11:20:32  <jmcarthur> because laziness takes some getting used to
2011-01-08T11:20:35  <antimatroid1> memory leak?
2011-01-08T11:21:04  <jmcarthur> memory leak carries connotations of not freeing unused allocations, which is different from what space leaks normally are
2011-01-08T11:21:51  <jmcarthur> a space leak most often happens in haskell when you inadvertantly build up a chain of thunks because you are misunderstanding the evaluation model
2011-01-08T11:22:18  <jmcarthur> the only situation that it can happen is if you continue to refer to lots of data that you don't need anymore, but that can happen in any garbage collected language
2011-01-08T11:22:25  <jmcarthur> *only **other**
2011-01-08T11:22:41  <antimatroid1> like calling repeat 5 without take?
2011-01-08T11:22:44  <jmcarthur> the chink of thunks issue happens to newbies quite often
2011-01-08T11:22:49  <jmcarthur> not like that
2011-01-08T11:23:05  <jmcarthur> repeat 5 actually builds a cyclic list in memory, so you will not ever run out of memory that way
2011-01-08T11:23:18  <jmcarthur> s/chink/chain/
2011-01-08T11:24:01  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay, anyway, i should sleep, night
2011-01-08T11:24:13  <jmcarthur> the chain of thunks situation can occur if, for example, you are using an accumulator in a recursive function and don't evaluate the accumulator on each step

2011-01-08T15:35:58  <jmcarthur> so i started coding up this tron idea. i'm wondering if anybody has any thoughts on whether the engine should tell the bots which bikes created which walls. not telling means that the bot has to guess which walls would disappear after killing which bikes if the bot didn't see when the wall was created
2011-01-08T15:36:36  <jmcarthur> telling would also give the bot more information to guess where a particular bike may be on the map
2011-01-08T15:37:08  <Error323> hey guys, what'll be the challenge for this Feb?

2011-01-08T16:02:11  <amstan_> jmcarthur: let's change the way that stuff is made
2011-01-08T16:02:19  <amstan_> jmcarthur: force all the bots to keep their own map state
2011-01-08T16:02:26  <amstan_> all they get is where each bike went
2011-01-08T16:04:16  <jmcarthur> amstan_: but in my idea not all bikes are visible, so you still have to give information about what's visible, including walls
2011-01-08T16:04:25  <amstan_> oh, right
2011-01-08T16:04:30  <jmcarthur> since the walls could have been created by invisible bikes
2011-01-08T16:04:35  <amstan_> yeah

2011-01-08T16:51:05  <dmj111> for what is worth, I think the state should include who made which walls.  and, that the engine should send the whole state.  many people had a hard enough time with testing as it was.
2011-01-08T16:55:36  <jmcarthur> so, no occlusion is what you suggest?
2011-01-08T16:56:12  <jmcarthur> i am finding that visibility tests are a bit more work than i was hoping, even for very simple tile-based games like this :\
2011-01-08T16:56:39  <jmcarthur> like, of course it wouldn't be a big deal for the engine to do, but if a lot of people end up wanting to predict visibility in their bots then they would also have to do all that work
2011-01-08T16:57:37  <jmcarthur> dmj111: ^^
2011-01-08T16:58:41  <dmj111> I was talking about amstan_'s suggestion, to only send moves.  I mentioned a concern about visibility yesterday, but hadn't thought of how players
2011-01-08T16:58:44  <dmj111> would manage it.
2011-01-08T16:58:53  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-01-08T16:59:10  <dmj111> i think the occlusion would make the game more interesting,
2011-01-08T16:59:19  <jmcarthur> well, i think *most* bots wouldn't need to replicate the line of sight stuff
2011-01-08T16:59:26  <jmcarthur> and those that do are doing fancy stuff anyway
2011-01-08T16:59:30  <jmcarthur> but i dunno for sure
2011-01-08T17:00:03  <dmj111> yeah...
2011-01-08T17:00:14  <jmcarthur> the line of sight *would* have to be in the specification though, which is mainly what worries me. it's hard enough to make a clear specification without complicated algorithms
2011-01-08T17:00:17  <dmj111> if you get even a partial engine working, I can try to make a simple bot.
2011-01-08T17:00:29  <jmcarthur> cool. g2g
2011-01-08T17:00:37  <dmj111> i have ghc lying around here somewhere...
2011-01-08T17:02:35  <jmcarthur> well you shouldn't need to use haskell just ot make a bot ;(
2011-01-08T17:02:37  <jmcarthur> *to
2011-01-08T17:02:42  <jmcarthur> *;)
2011-01-08T17:02:48  <jmcarthur> i suck at the typing
2011-01-08T17:02:53  <antimatroid1> before you pointed out the problem with vision, i wouldn't have passed them information about who made walls
2011-01-08T17:03:32  <antimatroid1> it requires you to send a lot more information to/from bots
2011-01-08T17:04:03  <jmcarthur> well, if the bots are labelled A-F, the walls could just be labelled a-f or something like that
2011-01-08T17:04:18  <jmcarthur> so no more weird than the previous use of # for walls
2011-01-08T17:05:09  <jmcarthur> by "g2g" i meant "brb"
2011-01-08T17:05:10  <jmcarthur> ugh
2011-01-08T17:05:36  <jmcarthur> oh i guess you would need haskell to build the engine i'm making
2011-01-08T17:17:27  <antimatroid1> can you just give a compiled version of it?
2011-01-08T17:18:16  <jmcarthur> yeah, once it's at the stage that it's worth bothering
2011-01-08T17:18:56  <jmcarthur> i can build for 64 bit linux on my main machine, and i have access to an OS X box. i won't be able to build for windows at all, and i'll need to set up a VM to build for 32 bit linux
2011-01-08T17:19:32  <jmcarthur> it's 64 bit OS X, but i'm not sure if the recommended GHC for OS X is still 32 bit or not
2011-01-08T17:20:21  <jmcarthur> so i'll need a volunteer to build for windows, and i might need a volunteer to build for a different architecture for os x
2011-01-08T17:21:17  <antimatroid1> i can do windows, but i wont be here for the next 6 days
2011-01-08T17:21:28  <antimatroid1> i'm just cleaning up stuff to leave in an hour or two
2011-01-08T17:25:09  <jmcarthur> that's fine
2011-01-08T17:25:39  <jmcarthur> i'll only be at all concerned about it if the engine ends up being adopted officially
