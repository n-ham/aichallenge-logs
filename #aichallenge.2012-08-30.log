2012-08-30T16:29:22  <UncleVasya> now trie
2012-08-30T16:29:47  <mcstar> let (^.) str ch = Printf.sprintf "%s%c" str ch
2012-08-30T16:30:02  <mcstar> using an infix operator for an effectful function, is not a good idea imho
2012-08-30T16:30:16  <UncleVasya> yep, the first solution that came to my mind...
2012-08-30T16:30:30  <mcstar> ah sorry
2012-08-30T16:30:32  <mcstar> sprintf
2012-08-30T16:30:37  <mcstar> that gives back a string
2012-08-30T16:30:39  <UncleVasya> ok, I'll check. thanks
2012-08-30T16:30:53  <mcstar> no, its ok, i thought you print to stdout, but not
2012-08-30T16:31:18  <mcstar> UncleVasya: is it faster to sprintf, than to concatenate strings?
2012-08-30T16:31:51  <mcstar> or, just you didnt find an alternative of appending a character to the end of a string?

2012-08-30T16:33:33  <UncleVasya> I don't know. I needed to add char to a string and it happened I hadn't an internet to look for a right way to do it. And reading standart library didn't helped me (maybe I had to read it more carefuly)
2012-08-30T16:33:35  <thestinger> radix tries are so awesome
2012-08-30T16:34:08  <mcstar> UncleVasya: the problem with ocaml stirngs is that they arent lists, like in haskell
2012-08-30T16:34:30  <thestinger> the problem with haskell strings, is that they're lists
2012-08-30T16:34:38  <thestinger> so you must use bytestring for anything non-trivial :P
2012-08-30T16:34:41  <mcstar> no, thats not a problem
2012-08-30T16:34:48  <mcstar> no
2012-08-30T16:34:50  <thestinger> yes
2012-08-30T16:34:53  <thestinger> yes.
2012-08-30T16:35:02  <mcstar> you need bytestrings if performance matters
2012-08-30T16:35:17  <mcstar> i mean, if otherwise lists would be slow
2012-08-30T16:35:32  <thestinger> at least they're singly linked lists
2012-08-30T16:35:33  <mcstar> but list based strings are comfortable
2012-08-30T16:35:41  <thestinger> I wonder what chunked laziness would be like
2012-08-30T16:36:00  <mcstar> lazy bytestring is 'chinkedlu lazy'
2012-08-30T16:36:07  <mcstar> it is strict per chunk
2012-08-30T16:36:17  <mcstar> chunkedly*
2012-08-30T16:37:36  <mcstar> UncleVasya: in place of the node_* functions, you could have use a record, couldnt you?
2012-08-30T16:38:46  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, I mean instead of using a singly-linked list as the fundamental data structure, using a chunked list instead
2012-08-30T16:38:47  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i like that you kept my bencmark function :)
2012-08-30T16:39:35  <mcstar> thestinger: that would change list semantics
2012-08-30T16:39:36  <UncleVasya> mcstar: it was an exercise from Developing applications with Objective Caml  book and the condition of task was to write tree using this type.
2012-08-30T16:39:55  <thestinger> mcstar: ofc, it wouldn't be the same language :P
2012-08-30T16:40:16  <UncleVasya> mcstar: _I_ like it and kept because of that :)
2012-08-30T16:40:23  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-30T16:41:00  <mcstar> anyway, it is good to know you liked it

2012-08-30T16:42:47  <mcstar> UncleVasya: divident is what shareholders get, royalty is what you pay for using someone else's stuff
