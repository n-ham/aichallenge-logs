2012-03-03T07:00:48  <antimatroidl> mcstar: ordered a new bike today :D
2012-03-03T07:01:02  <mcstar> wunderful
2012-03-03T07:01:14  <mcstar> what's wrong with the old one?
2012-03-03T07:01:29  <antimatroidl> my tip shop one broke
2012-03-03T07:01:35  <antimatroidl> and i preferred that to my other one
2012-03-03T07:01:45  <antimatroidl> so getting a new one like the tip shop one
2012-03-03T07:01:55  <mcstar> 'tip shop'?
2012-03-03T07:02:06  <antimatroidl> there's a shop at the tip here
2012-03-03T07:02:09  <antimatroidl> which we call the tip shop
2012-03-03T07:02:12  <antimatroidl> bike cost me $15
2012-03-03T07:02:14  <mcstar> ^_^
2012-03-03T07:02:37  <mcstar> (thats a sort of angry face, cause how could i have know there is a tip shop there..)
2012-03-03T07:02:42  <mcstar> known
2012-03-03T07:03:00  <antimatroidl> :P
2012-03-03T07:03:00  <mcstar> how much does the new one cost?
2012-03-03T07:03:04  <antimatroidl> only 400
2012-03-03T07:03:08  <antimatroidl> it's a 2011 model
2012-03-03T07:03:10  <antimatroidl> http://www.marinbikes.com/2011/bicycles/a6s-2ur_MUIRWOODS_c1.jpg
2012-03-03T07:03:22  <mcstar> is that au$?
2012-03-03T07:03:27  <antimatroidl> yeah
2012-03-03T07:03:46  <antimatroidl> i wanted rigid steel frame without disk brakes, so pretty much exactly what i wanted
2012-03-03T07:03:54  <antimatroidl> gonna put some fatter tyres on it
2012-03-03T07:04:33  <mcstar> looks reasonable
2012-03-03T07:04:41  <antimatroidl> the "fake scratching" is pretty lame
2012-03-03T07:04:45  <antimatroidl> it's like pre ripped jeans aha
2012-03-03T07:05:10  <antimatroidl> but it's through the local bike shop guy and can't find anything closer to what i want without that anyway
2012-03-03T07:05:13  <mcstar> i dont see that on the pic
2012-03-03T07:05:35  <antimatroidl> on the fork, and top tube etc?
2012-03-03T07:05:39  <mcstar> that tiread are 1.5-6 right?
2012-03-03T07:05:42  <mcstar> tires*
2012-03-03T07:06:01  <antimatroidl> 26" diameter and 1.4" wide i think
2012-03-03T07:06:09  <mcstar> looks wider
2012-03-03T07:06:18  <antimatroidl> i'll see if i can't put the tip shop tyres on which are like 1.8 or so
2012-03-03T07:06:23  <mcstar> i bought an 1.4 for my rear wheel
2012-03-03T07:06:48  <mcstar> some hutchinson tire, really slick
2012-03-03T07:07:01  <antimatroidl> website claims there's a fair bit of clearence for mtb tyres
2012-03-03T07:07:14  <antimatroidl> i want knobbly
2012-03-03T07:07:46  <mcstar> well, you want to ride the dirt roads so it is reasonable
2012-03-03T07:07:58  <mcstar> i wanted to opposite
2012-03-03T07:08:12  <mcstar> my frame is aluminu
2012-03-03T07:08:12  <antimatroidl> i mostly ride on concrete, but i like jumping it off gutters and being able to go offroad
2012-03-03T07:08:14  <mcstar> m
2012-03-03T07:08:27  <antimatroidl> my other bike is aluminium

2012-03-03T07:09:43  <antimatroidl> 27 i think
2012-03-03T07:09:47  <antimatroidl> 700
2012-03-03T07:09:51  <antimatroidl> whatever that is
2012-03-03T07:09:55  <antimatroidl> i'm not very knowledgeable
2012-03-03T07:09:58  <mcstar> yeah that 28" i think
2012-03-03T07:10:36  <mcstar> TIRESFuji, 700 X 28c wire
2012-03-03T07:10:59  <antimatroidl> i've got some continental ones on there atm which are wider
2012-03-03T07:11:13  <antimatroidl> although they're pretty much worn, i have some other thin ones to go back on there too
2012-03-03T07:12:01  <antimatroidl> also, library genesis is down :(
2012-03-03T07:12:40  <mcstar> i forgot the brand name of my bike

2012-03-03T07:18:26  <antimatroidl> tasty
2012-03-03T07:24:27  <mcstar> how long does it take for you to get tired riding on terrain?
2012-03-03T07:26:04  <antimatroidl> depends on wind and how hard i'm riding
2012-03-03T07:26:13  <antimatroidl> it takes me about half an hour to ride to uni
2012-03-03T07:26:31  <antimatroidl> my back usually gets quite sweaty with a bag on it (with a laptop in it)
2012-03-03T07:26:59  <mcstar> no, i mean on terrain

2012-03-03T07:27:30  <antimatroidl> ahhh, i don't really do that very often
2012-03-03T07:27:40  <antimatroidl> but i usually just ride around slower
2012-03-03T07:28:14  <mcstar> but you bought this bike to do this right?
2012-03-03T07:28:26  <antimatroidl> yeah i want to go up the mountain to some tracks
2012-03-03T07:28:33  <antimatroidl> but never have :P
2012-03-03T07:28:44  <antimatroidl> this bike would be better suited so hopefully i'll get around to it
2012-03-03T07:28:54  <antimatroidl> and there's a place nearer which i do go to occasionally but not really that off road
2012-03-03T07:29:01  <antimatroidl> more gravel paths etc.
2012-03-03T07:29:05  <mcstar> well, its gonna be fall there, so the temperature will be perfect
