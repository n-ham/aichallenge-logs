2011-10-15T03:12:38  <antimatroid> eashoka: i don't even remember it happening aha, my dad took that picture in the emergency waiting room
2011-10-15T03:13:31  <antimatroid> it looks like someone beat the crap out of me, but i'm told i just fell off a wheelie bin and down some stairs
2011-10-15T03:14:48  <eashoka> antimatroid : ur dad seems to believe in 'a picture worth thousand words". if he ever wants to convince u on not to get too drunk, that pic will save him few paragraphs :-)

2011-10-15T18:33:31  <contestbot> amstan_: OK
2011-10-15T18:34:54  <amstan_> contestbot: later tell mleise how can i get your visualizer to show me as much of the games as possible, ideally no controls
2011-10-15T18:34:54  <contestbot> amstan_: Aye, aye, sir

2011-10-15T18:49:23  <janzert> I believe gattschardo had one that was basically finished, you might want to check with him
2011-10-15T18:49:45  <janzert> maybe by posting a comment in this issue https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/266
2011-10-15T18:50:07  <amstan_> janzert: perfect, you're here
2011-10-15T18:50:16  <amstan_> janzert: how do i get new maps?
2011-10-15T18:50:17  <janzert> uh oh :)
2011-10-15T18:50:45  <amstan_> jeff wants something that's on youtube, i'm thinking to get a map that has the proper aspect ratio
2011-10-15T18:50:52  <amstan_> and then find interesting games from it
2011-10-15T18:51:16  <janzert> I get them by running the mapgenerators under ants/mapgen
2011-10-15T18:51:51  <janzert> not sure why we need something on youtube though?
2011-10-15T18:52:04  <amstan_> janzert: apparently there will be blogs and google+ involved
2011-10-15T18:52:10  <amstan_> so embeding the visualizer will be hard
2011-10-15T18:52:34  <janzert> ahh and hmm
2011-10-15T18:53:08  <janzert> not sure of an easy way to get good games from a map you generate yourself currently though
2011-10-15T18:53:28  <amstan_> i can do some sql to manually find them
2011-10-15T18:53:37  <amstan_> if it has some of the top players they're bound to be interesting
2011-10-15T18:53:42  <janzert> probably better off using a game from the server although those maps aren't generally going to be the best aspect ration for you :/
2011-10-15T18:54:28  <janzert> even just browsing through the recent games list usually finds good games fairly quickly
2011-10-15T18:55:24  <janzert> probably just limit yourself to games that have rank stabilized or lone survivor ending and mainly look at games with higher level players
2011-10-15T18:56:15  <janzert> maze_15 seems like it might be a good aspect ration for a video
2011-10-15T18:56:59  <janzert> maze_5
2011-10-15T18:57:04  <amstan_> still too squarey
2011-10-15T18:57:43  <amstan_> i need something with 1.777.. maze15 is 1.5
2011-10-15T18:58:14  <janzert> that's what slides used to be ;)
2011-10-15T18:58:17  <janzert> 2:3
2011-10-15T18:59:14  <amstan_> i need one that's 128/72
2011-10-15T18:59:18  <amstan_> x*
2011-10-15T18:59:28  <janzert> maze_6 is 1.6

2011-10-15T19:02:09  <janzert> multi_maze_02 is 1.64
2011-10-15T19:02:50  <janzert> although it has some hills completely surrounded by water
2011-10-15T19:03:26  <amstan_> i don't like that i can't give the mapgen exact dimensions
2011-10-15T19:03:49  <janzert> can't the range be limited?
2011-10-15T19:03:55  <janzert> just give it a range of 1
2011-10-15T19:03:57  <amstan_> nope, only both x and y at the same time
2011-10-15T19:04:04  <amstan_> wait, range?
2011-10-15T19:04:05  <janzert> ahh
2011-10-15T19:04:17  <janzert> upper and lower bound
2011-10-15T19:04:27  <amstan_> yes, but only for both at the same time
2011-10-15T19:04:37  <janzert> I've done basically nothing with the mapgen so I don't really know
2011-10-15T19:04:51  <amstan_>     parser.add_option("--min_dimensions", dest="min_dimensions",
2011-10-15T19:04:52  <amstan_>                       type="int", default=60,
2011-10-15T19:04:54  <amstan_>                       help="Minimum number of rows/cols to be used")
2011-10-15T19:11:28  <amstan_> k, this won't end anywhere
2011-10-15T19:14:00  <amstan_> contestbot: later tell antimatroid how can i get a 16:9 aspect ratio map?
2011-10-15T19:14:00  <contestbot> amstan_: OK
2011-10-15T19:14:16  <amstan_> this thing is doing magic
