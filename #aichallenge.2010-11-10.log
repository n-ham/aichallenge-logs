2010-11-10T09:20:15  <antimatroid1> how's the bot coming along?
2010-11-10T09:20:29  <antimatroid1> i'm maybe a day away from having a completely new one
2010-11-10T09:20:41  <antimatroid1> although the ideas much the same, hopefully it'll be entirely bug free
2010-11-10T09:20:43  <bhasker> not much progress, i think i am done for the competition , now i am just oging to write a minmax bot for learning
2010-11-10T09:21:02  <bhasker> my current submission will probably be my last one
2010-11-10T09:21:09  <antimatroid1> ah fair enough

2010-11-10T09:25:18  <bhasker> i will have to rewrite my bot's core to make it amenable for a minmax kind of solution
2010-11-10T09:25:25  <bhasker> right now my game state is not maintained very cleanly
2010-11-10T09:25:33  <bhasker> and functions don't allow easy swapping of players

2010-11-10T13:29:59  <cfaftw> my C bot now parses input, makes the appropriate data structures, and regurgitates the state data! Booyah!
2010-11-10T13:30:16  <janstaunton> good work :D
2010-11-10T13:30:25  <janstaunton> Isn't there a starter pack for C?
2010-11-10T13:30:28  <cfaftw> next step:  simulate game
2010-11-10T13:30:39  <cfaftw> janstaunton, not that i could find
2010-11-10T13:30:52  <janstaunton> There may not be, I just assumed there would be one :)
2010-11-10T13:31:09  <cfaftw> yeah you'd think
2010-11-10T13:31:25  <cfaftw> maybe i should release this one
2010-11-10T13:31:45  <cfaftw> it's not pretty though... i haven't worked with C in a while so, i'm still trying to remember how to organize things
2010-11-10T13:32:07  <lavalamp_> demerzel was having problems with his C bot reading stdin
2010-11-10T13:32:33  <cfaftw> yeah
2010-11-10T13:32:52  <cfaftw> mine works fine when i copy and paste the state info to my bot
2010-11-10T13:32:58  <cfaftw> not sure if piping will break it
2010-11-10T13:33:02  <cfaftw> oh wait, let's find out now :P
2010-11-10T13:33:04  <lavalamp_> ah, might want to test that
2010-11-10T13:33:35  <cfaftw> piping works
2010-11-10T13:33:58  <cfaftw> i'm using fgets and sscanf, which is what he's using... not sure what would cause it to break
2010-11-10T13:34:26  <lavalamp_> huh
2010-11-10T13:34:53  <lavalamp_> I made a test C file that I could type at and pipe to but it still didn't work with jbotmanager...
2010-11-10T13:35:08  <cfaftw> interesting
2010-11-10T13:35:21  <cfaftw> i'll have to test that later...

2010-11-10T13:45:56  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-11-10T13:46:35  <lavalamp_> I think I finally have all the bugs out of mine...
2010-11-10T13:47:16  <lavalamp_> though it does a bit more than that, it keeps track of new orders and available ships and how that will all play out...

2010-11-10T13:52:11  <cfaftw> i can't wait to get to the minimax part
2010-11-10T13:52:19  <lavalamp_> cfaftw, golang.org
2010-11-10T13:52:47  <cfaftw> i don't care if i don't make an awesome bot... at this point i just want to write a working implementation of minimax
2010-11-10T13:52:57  <cfaftw> (which is supposedly easy)
2010-11-10T13:53:14  <JamesMG> if I did it, it's easy
2010-11-10T13:53:16  <cfaftw> but when I say "working" i mean "producing useful results"
2010-11-10T13:53:19  <lavalamp_> meh... mine doesn't really work right yet, I wouldn't call it easy
2010-11-10T13:53:21  <JamesMG> although working is debatable
2010-11-10T13:53:39  <JamesMG> does it process a payoff tree? yes
2010-11-10T13:53:46  <JamesMG> does it ever win a game? no.
2010-11-10T13:54:14  <cfaftw> haha
2010-11-10T13:54:30  <lavalamp_> minimax for this game leaves you with a super hard problem (move generation) and a very hard problem (board evaluation)
2010-11-10T13:55:30  <cfaftw> lavalamp_, i already have an idea for board evaluation at each leaf... but yeah, move generation is going to be tricky
2010-11-10T13:55:45  <lavalamp_> I'm excited about the move generator I'm working on now... but I'm going to have to fix the timeouts: http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=lavalamp.oblina.0
2010-11-10T13:56:01  <cfaftw> what is causing the timeouts?
2010-11-10T13:56:10  <lavalamp_> me taking too long XP
2010-11-10T13:56:16  <lavalamp_> seriously, I don't know
2010-11-10T13:57:07  <lavalamp_> I have a few too many hairy loops, I guess
2010-11-10T13:57:52  <cfaftw> wow i like your first move on this win:  http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=943747
2010-11-10T13:58:06  <lavalamp_> hopefully I will be able to get it working fast enough to actually serve as a generator :/
2010-11-10T13:58:32  <lavalamp_> yeah I really like the crazy risks it takes
2010-11-10T13:58:45  <lavalamp_> I'm not quite sure if it's a bug or not, I hope not
2010-11-10T13:59:03  <cfaftw> lol, well you'll find out later when you accidentally "fix" it
2010-11-10T13:59:11  <lavalamp_> no doubt :(
2010-11-10T14:00:23  <lavalamp_> here's another one where it's gambit payed off: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=943316
2010-11-10T14:00:35  <lavalamp_> of course it couldn't keep the advantage and timed out to boot
2010-11-10T14:01:49  <cfaftw> nice
2010-11-10T14:01:57  <cfaftw> opponent used the same strat, but didn't send enough ships
2010-11-10T14:02:08  <lavalamp_> it had a won game if it had defended instead of going after the third neutral
2010-11-10T14:02:49  <lavalamp_> yeah... also opponent was too late, or should have been...
2010-11-10T14:03:13  <lavalamp_> but committing 94 ships to a planet right next to the enemy's base is gutsy
2010-11-10T14:03:36  <cfaftw> yep
2010-11-10T14:03:39  <cfaftw> anyway, i'm out

2010-11-10T16:15:48  <demerzel> lavalamp_ i finally got it!  only able to use commands that don't  have to specify stdin/stdout
2010-11-10T16:15:52  <lavalamp_> say how is your bot doing now that you finally got it up?
2010-11-10T16:16:10  <lavalamp_> really? O.o

2010-11-10T16:16:26  <demerzel> for whatever reason the halting nature of the stdin/sdout makes FILE* handling unstable, i ended up with a getchar() loop and output is a putchar() loop followed by fflush
2010-11-10T16:16:46  <lavalamp_> huh
2010-11-10T16:16:48  <demerzel> i coudl use scanf/printf directly too but it was a dirty dirty hack
2010-11-10T16:17:07  <lavalamp_> I wouldn't touch it once it was working... :/

2010-11-10T16:17:45  <demerzel> i had stdin working but stdout still wasn't haha
2010-11-10T16:17:54  <demerzel> then i was like well hell let's try putchar and yep it worked
2010-11-10T16:18:34  <lavalamp_> so strange
2010-11-10T16:18:39  <demerzel> yea no shit
2010-11-10T16:18:46  <demerzel> it frustrated me enough to take a day off

2010-11-10T16:28:21  <demerzel> he did say he has some crazy ass self-alloc system
2010-11-10T16:28:32  <demerzel> like allocs a huge block then manually doles it out for some reason
2010-11-10T16:28:39  <demerzel> probably by the time that's done the pipe is stable
2010-11-10T16:28:49  <McLeopold> too crazy
2010-11-10T16:28:50  <lavalamp_> cftfw is writing a C bot, too, he was here earlier
2010-11-10T16:29:09  <demerzel> why is that crazy lavalamp?  those seem like solid, if aggressive, picks
2010-11-10T16:29:20  <lavalamp_> I think they're risky
2010-11-10T16:29:30  <demerzel> yea but i mean 5/5 is pretty tempting
2010-11-10T16:29:44  <McLeopold> the first move is unsustainable
2010-11-10T16:29:46  <demerzel> i like that map
2010-11-10T16:29:49  <lavalamp_> E323 could have beat my 94 ships if he'd sent everything there on the next turn
2010-11-10T16:29:59  <lavalamp_> yeah it's interesting
2010-11-10T16:30:14  <demerzel> i guess i gotta get back to work on logic lol
2010-11-10T16:30:20  <demerzel> that was a fun 2 or 3 day diversion lol
2010-11-10T16:30:26  <lavalamp_> :/
2010-11-10T16:30:33  <demerzel> i did take a day off tho
2010-11-10T16:30:37  <demerzel> just couldn't take googling any more
2010-11-10T16:31:06  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: yeah I liked it at first but you're right...
2010-11-10T16:31:20  <lavalamp_> Good news is it's probably a bug, I have no idea how my code generated that move
2010-11-10T16:31:28  <lavalamp_> bad news is I have bugs
2010-11-10T16:31:28  <McLeopold> I think you should still try for that stuff, but that particular one shouldn't have worked.
2010-11-10T16:31:43  <demerzel> do you assume the enemy is as smart as you?
2010-11-10T16:31:46  <demerzel> gotten me into trouble
2010-11-10T16:32:03  <demerzel> particularly in situations where i'm holding back x ships for defense, y for minimum needed etc
2010-11-10T16:32:04  <McLeopold> Well, I don't predict, but I'm not going to leave myself open either.
2010-11-10T16:32:05  <demerzel> i end up locked down
2010-11-10T16:32:07  <lavalamp_> atm it assumes the enemy is dumb as rocks
2010-11-10T16:32:15  <demerzel> if i ever lose the edge that is
2010-11-10T16:33:32  <demerzel> yea what i put is pure greed, intended for my neutral acquisition
2010-11-10T16:33:41  <demerzel> but i'm not sure when and how to flip the switch to minimax
2010-11-10T16:33:48  <demerzel> i mean i guess i know /how/ haha
2010-11-10T16:33:57  <demerzel> i don't wanna flip it too soon because pure greed can easily handle 4 ply
2010-11-10T16:34:00  <lavalamp_> oh that's not running minimax code?
2010-11-10T16:34:05  <demerzel> no that's pure greed
2010-11-10T16:34:28  <lavalamp_> ah, I'm planning to have the same process run the whole game... :/
2010-11-10T16:34:30  <demerzel> was just my neutral acq code, got all the enemy routines set up just haven't used them
2010-11-10T16:34:40  <demerzel> i think even that has bugs haha
2010-11-10T16:34:49  <demerzel> but i just barely got it working with all the new abstractions
2010-11-10T16:35:28  <lavalamp_> I want more time :(
2010-11-10T16:35:46  <demerzel> yea it's kinda amazing how that went from 'hey you got a month left!' to just over 2 weeks haha
2010-11-10T16:35:55  <demerzel> i'll just barely have any kind of game tree stabilized by then
2010-11-10T16:36:20  <lavalamp_> fortunately my framework seems stable

2010-11-10T17:07:15  <McLeopold> On the first one, he could have taken the center.
2010-11-10T17:07:30  <McLeopold> And he abandoned the growth 5 in the middle.

2010-11-10T17:37:37  <demerzel> is that total?
2010-11-10T17:37:48  <demerzel> or do you consider non conquer moves
2010-11-10T17:38:45  <McLeopold> It seems, if you send a giant fleet to a growth 2, that would be more valuable even if you lost a growth 5 by 1 ship.

2010-11-10T17:40:06  <lavalamp_> my eval function is more an attempt to look at features of the map: total growth rate, total ship count, connectedness of empire, etc
2010-11-10T17:40:21  <Error323_> (1 / 10000) * g(p)
2010-11-10T17:40:26  <Error323_> is very small
2010-11-10T17:40:37  <McLeopold> You should slap a basic defense routine in just before this runs.  I beat you'd do a lot better.
2010-11-10T17:40:46  <McLeopold> bet
2010-11-10T17:41:00  <Error323_> mmm well i tried stuff like that
2010-11-10T17:41:10  <Error323_> but interferes massively with the alphabeta
2010-11-10T17:41:13  <Migi32> well, if f_m(p) <= f_e(p) it's basically a free planet and you should score any node without that move infinity lower than one with it, so how about sum( g(p) / (f_m(p)-f_e(p)) ) ?
2010-11-10T17:41:18  <Error323_> as that assumes the same as the enemy will
2010-11-10T17:41:37  <McLeopold> if you put in the defense moves, the updated the game state, then did the search from there?
2010-11-10T17:42:58  <Error323_> mmm Migi32 let me think about that
2010-11-10T17:43:13  <Migi32> it's just growth / cost really :P
2010-11-10T17:44:03  <lavalamp_> I will be quite surprised if a simple (sort) formula like this actually does a good job evaulating various positions
2010-11-10T17:44:20  <Migi32> how is it doing now? What's its name on tcp?
2010-11-10T17:44:21  <lavalamp_> it seems like there are more factors

2010-11-10T17:45:45  <Error323_> yeah
2010-11-10T17:45:56  <Migi32> if it performs good with such a simple scoring function, you must have really good move generation/pruning
2010-11-10T17:45:56  <Error323_> and he's also going one ply
2010-11-10T17:46:00  <Error323_> i'm going two ply
2010-11-10T17:46:16  <lavalamp_> if you could get lots of depth, then something like that (or just # of ships) would probably work fine
2010-11-10T17:46:29  <lavalamp_> but at 1 or 2 ply I just don't see that working
2010-11-10T17:46:39  <Error323_> mja
2010-11-10T17:46:58  <Error323_> its probably mostly the actionset itself thats highly pruned

2010-11-10T17:50:19  <Migi32> :)
2010-11-10T17:50:38  <lavalamp_> yeah he was not enough ships ahead to do both for sure
2010-11-10T17:51:26  <McLeopold> it's the patience of error to hit the upper planet first that I like
2010-11-10T17:52:17  <lavalamp_> oldman didn't even need to take a neutral, he should have just been sending extra ships to drain E323's forces
2010-11-10T17:52:46  <McLeopold> true
2010-11-10T17:52:55  <McLeopold> or he could have taken the 52 first and waited
2010-11-10T17:53:07  <lavalamp_> yeah
2010-11-10T17:53:17  <Migi32> or he could just have done nothing
2010-11-10T17:53:45  <lavalamp_> IMO, having two large forces gives the underdog a chance to make complications

2010-11-10T18:23:17  <Migi32> Ghent University
2010-11-10T18:23:54  <Error323_> dus je spreekt nederlands?
2010-11-10T18:24:04  <Migi32> jaja :P
2010-11-10T18:24:06  <McLeopold> wow, i really went downhill today
2010-11-10T18:24:16  <Error323_> =]
2010-11-10T18:24:43  <Migi32> oh it's called affiliation, not organization
2010-11-10T18:25:08  <Zannick> my affiliation has nobody in the top 100 :(
2010-11-10T18:25:20  <Zannick> and i am 7th
2010-11-10T18:25:31  <Error323_> wut
2010-11-10T18:25:32  <Error323_> nice
2010-11-10T18:25:33  <sigh> my affiliation is owning the competition
2010-11-10T18:25:40  <Zannick> 7th in my affiliation, i mean
2010-11-10T18:25:43  <Error323_> ohh
2010-11-10T18:25:52  <Zannick> i am in the 700s :P
2010-11-10T18:27:42  <McLeopold> Error323_: I'm hoping to play your minimax bot
2010-11-10T18:27:45  <Error323_> bhasker_: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=954141 :D :P
2010-11-10T18:28:08  <bhasker_> heh behind by a few ships:(
2010-11-10T18:28:13  <Error323_> ye
2010-11-10T18:28:14  <bhasker_> problem with my bot being a bit reactionary
2010-11-10T18:28:22  <Migi32> only 4 people from Amsterdam. Spread the word, Error323_ :P
2010-11-10T18:28:23  <bhasker_> it doesn't acquire neutrals if we are close to even
2010-11-10T18:28:31  <bhasker_> unless the enemy acquires
2010-11-10T18:28:34  <bhasker_> so sometimes its a turn behind
2010-11-10T18:28:39  <bhasker_> and i lose a lot of games like this
2010-11-10T18:28:42  <Error323_> McLeopold: probably in time they will meet =)
2010-11-10T18:28:57  <bhasker_> you ignore http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=954169
2010-11-10T18:28:57  <Error323_> bhasker_: ye i have the same problem
2010-11-10T18:29:01  <bhasker_> :)
2010-11-10T18:29:02  <McLeopold> what do you use to run it?
2010-11-10T18:29:09  <McLeopold> I'm using JBotManager.
2010-11-10T18:29:36  <Error323_> hehe yeah :/
2010-11-10T18:29:47  <Error323_> this is a prblem with my action generation being very limited :P
2010-11-10T18:29:57  <bhasker_> :) the mistake was acquiring that neutral
2010-11-10T18:29:58  <bhasker_> inthe middle
2010-11-10T18:30:00  <Migi32> btw McLeopold, is it just my pc or does drawLines slow down JBotManager a lot?
2010-11-10T18:30:02  <bhasker_> next to the 5 growth
2010-11-10T18:30:07  <Error323_> indd
2010-11-10T18:30:09  <bhasker_> it does slow down a lot
2010-11-10T18:30:14  <bhasker_> and antialiasing too
2010-11-10T18:30:15  <McLeopold> I don't notice anything.
2010-11-10T18:30:27  <bhasker_> i guess also depends on the jvm
2010-11-10T18:30:37  <bhasker_> on my mac its annoying to use
2010-11-10T18:30:40  <bhasker_> so i just use my script now
2010-11-10T18:30:43  <bhasker_> to run it
2010-11-10T18:31:42  <Migi32> when I finally get a half-decent bot I think I'll just let JBotManager run as a kind of screensaver
2010-11-10T18:32:17  <Error323_> well given that its all generated and the simple eval func its actually not far off from my heuristic bot
2010-11-10T18:32:21  <Error323_> but ye
2010-11-10T18:32:30  <Error323_> this is not what i had hoped :P

2010-11-10T18:35:34  <Migi32> Error323_, what's the average # states you generate?
2010-11-10T18:35:49  <Migi32> 3000 sounds reasonable
2010-11-10T18:35:52  <Error323_> don't know tbh
2010-11-10T18:37:24  <Error323_> its very dependent on the game and opponent
2010-11-10T18:37:36  <Migi32> I did a minimax-like thing and the average number of "suggestions" it made was like 300 per turn, with spikes of over 100000 (that's where it timed out after 60 seconds)
2010-11-10T18:38:59  <Migi32> and the best move it found was on 90% of the turns doing nothing XD
2010-11-10T18:39:11  <sigh> yeah, I had something similar by iterating over the powerset of planets to attack

2010-11-10T18:41:59  <McLeopold> yeah! error
2010-11-10T18:42:20  <McLeopold> i think it's the minimax one
2010-11-10T18:43:20  <Migi32> McLeopold, is AntBot your latest bot in development?
2010-11-10T18:43:25  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-10T18:43:40  <McLeopold> it's still got some major problems though
2010-11-10T18:43:50  <McLeopold> And I'm worried about performance
2010-11-10T18:43:58  <McLeopold> I fear it will timeout in most matches on official
2010-11-10T18:44:30  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: is it minimaxing?
2010-11-10T18:44:32  <Error323_> yep
2010-11-10T18:44:35  <Error323_> it will
2010-11-10T18:44:49  <McLeopold> no, crazy heurististics
2010-11-10T18:44:50  <antimatroid1> i think i've given up on minimax, it's too hard to get the information correct and not reduce it to a crawling pace
2010-11-10T18:45:15  <sigh> antimatroid1: it's only been one day o_O
2010-11-10T18:45:15  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'm going to see what i can do at making a kickass heuristic bot now
2010-11-10T18:45:34  <antimatroid1> sigh: i  made the decision last night, i was doing too many calculations just to ensure information was correct

2010-11-10T18:46:52  <bhasker_> my bot will soon start dropping in rating though once it starts going up against Accoun* variants
2010-11-10T18:47:12  <Error323_> nice
2010-11-10T18:47:19  <Error323_> the llast one has a nice neutral cap
2010-11-10T18:47:25  <Error323_> while i'm doing nothing -.-
2010-11-10T18:47:36  <bhasker_> yup
2010-11-10T18:48:03  <bhasker_> even in the first one
2010-11-10T18:48:09  <bhasker_> i capture two neutrals at the back of my base
2010-11-10T18:48:11  <antimatroid1> sigh: to draw a picture, i had not just data for incoming and outgoing fleets, but also mock incoming and outgoing fleets
2010-11-10T18:48:31  <bhasker_> antimatroid i tried that
2010-11-10T18:48:35  <bhasker_> doesn't work very well
2010-11-10T18:48:37  <bhasker_> bot just stalls
2010-11-10T18:49:05  <antimatroid1> all outgoing fleets had to be done individually, and every time i generated future states i had to clear mock incoming and resend them as i generated, it was too much for me and i dropped it
2010-11-10T18:49:06  <bhasker_> everytime i try to give it better /accurate information to calculate available ships etc it just stalls
2010-11-10T18:49:39  <antimatroid1> well, it could have been done, but not efficiently
2010-11-10T18:49:52  <antimatroid1> not to do that in every node of a game tree
2010-11-10T18:50:09  <sigh> hmm... ok, this weekend I'm going to spend a few hours to see if I can think up a light-weigth minimax
2010-11-10T18:50:35  <antimatroid1> minimax isn't the problem, it's resolving the moves they then make (rembering i'm not just sending fleets "now")
2010-11-10T18:51:08  <sigh> yeah, I mean the whole package

2010-11-10T18:53:18  <McLeopold> that is how not to take neutrals when your ahead

2010-11-10T18:54:43  <McLeopold> Error323_: I've got the same advice for myself now. :)
2010-11-10T18:56:48  <bhasker_> mcleopold my bot does that i have a simple check  ( if myprod>enemy) don't acquire neutral!
2010-11-10T18:56:54  <bhasker_> unless enemy is acquiring
2010-11-10T18:56:59  <bhasker_> in which case you either snipe
2010-11-10T18:57:02  <bhasker_> or acquire your own
2010-11-10T18:57:12  <McLeopold> that sounds good
2010-11-10T18:57:59  <bhasker_> otherwise my bot will not go for new neutrals
2010-11-10T18:58:05  <bhasker_> if its even
2010-11-10T18:58:18  <bhasker_> it will go if it think it can acquire neutral for which i look at a few factor
2010-11-10T18:58:19  <bhasker_> s
2010-11-10T18:58:36  <bhasker_> my ships/enemyships, my ships headed to neutrals,enemy ships headed to neutrals
2010-11-10T18:58:41  <bhasker_> enemy ships incoming
2010-11-10T18:58:42  <bhasker_> etc
2010-11-10T18:58:55  <antimatroid1> i do growth counts after all fleets are run
2010-11-10T18:59:07  <antimatroid1> and make expansionary moves based off of that
2010-11-10T18:59:09  <bhasker_> and approximately how many ships i can expect from the new planet before enemies first attack reaches
2010-11-10T18:59:10  <bhasker_> eg
2010-11-10T18:59:25  <bhasker_> (closestDist-turnsToAcquire)*growth
2010-11-10T18:59:33  <bhasker_> if its <0 i just set it to zero
2010-11-10T18:59:56  <bhasker_> if its >0 i just add that to the left side of the equation

2010-11-10T19:01:06  <demerzel> about to plug back in to tcp after i figure out what to do with minimax lol
2010-11-10T19:01:14  <demerzel> i'm pretty sure even my pure greed code is bugged
2010-11-10T19:01:25  <sigh> everyone is minimaxing it up
2010-11-10T19:01:39  <bhasker_> everyone is bored of turning heuristics
2010-11-10T19:01:41  <bhasker_> :-\
2010-11-10T19:01:43  <bhasker_> i think
2010-11-10T19:01:53  <demerzel> i've never had heuristics
2010-11-10T19:01:59  <sigh> well, some people are just maxing and calling it minimax apparently
2010-11-10T19:02:06  <demerzel> yea lol
2010-11-10T19:02:20  <demerzel> i've been pure max since the beginning and minimax is def a lot harder
2010-11-10T19:02:52  <Mathnerd314> minimax is just wrong
2010-11-10T19:03:04  <demerzel> how so
2010-11-10T19:03:05  <Mathnerd314> it's simultaneous play
2010-11-10T19:03:27  <Mathnerd314> minimax only works for sequential games
2010-11-10T19:03:47  <demerzel> so you treat it like the enemy is about to go?
2010-11-10T19:03:48  <antimatroid1> pure max isn't minimax
2010-11-10T19:03:49  <sigh> Mathnerd314: yeah, it is an approximation
2010-11-10T19:03:50  <demerzel> it's not that different
2010-11-10T19:03:55  <antimatroid1> well, technically i guess it is
2010-11-10T19:04:04  <sigh> Mathnerd314: it's not necessarily wrong, it worked well enough for tron
2010-11-10T19:04:08  <demerzel> pure max is not minimax - it's not even maximin
2010-11-10T19:04:15  <demerzel> it's not even considering the enemy

2010-11-10T19:04:31  <demerzel> it's greed in game theory terms i've learned
2010-11-10T19:04:45  <Mathnerd314> demerzel: depends on your evaluation function
2010-11-10T19:04:47  <antimatroid1> demerzel: you're still running "minimax", there's just no nodes from player 2
2010-11-10T19:04:52  <Prillicy> my bot is timing out on the first move and I don't know why, anyone want to take a look?
2010-11-10T19:05:08  <demerzel> antimatroid1: no, minimax by definition requires the other player
2010-11-10T19:05:11  <bhasker_> there is no minimization happening
2010-11-10T19:05:15  <demerzel> you are 'minimizing'
2010-11-10T19:05:18  <bhasker_> if you do only one ply
2010-11-10T19:05:19  <demerzel> yea what he said
2010-11-10T19:05:41  <bhasker_> with 1 ply you are basically scoring your move
2010-11-10T19:05:43  <bhasker_> thats about it
2010-11-10T19:05:47  <demerzel> Mathnerd314: i have been pure score with varying horizons forever i guarantee it's nowhere near minimax - doesn't even require a tree
2010-11-10T19:05:50  <bhasker_> and executing moves with best scores
2010-11-10T19:05:56  <demerzel> it's a lot easier ;)
2010-11-10T19:06:04  <demerzel> but i get spanked by real strategy bots
2010-11-10T19:06:19  <antimatroid1> i think it's like saying reals with + is a group
2010-11-10T19:06:27  <antimatroid1> it is, but you're not really covering everything
2010-11-10T19:06:39  <demerzel> i have no idea what that is referencing lol
2010-11-10T19:06:45  <antimatroid1> well you'
2010-11-10T19:06:58  <antimatroid1> re still doing minimax with one player (can run the same functions), you just aren't using it all
2010-11-10T19:07:11  <demerzel> what are you all going to do after this is over?  i've been working on this for like 2 months gonna be a huge vacuum
2010-11-10T19:07:12  <antimatroid1> and a group of the reals with + isn't covering the whole existence of . on them

2010-11-10T19:23:17  <McLeopold> you guys both do it twice at the same time
2010-11-10T19:24:17  <McLeopold> I guess you survived a little longer?

2010-11-10T19:24:29  <davidjliu> yeah, I survived a bit longer
2010-11-10T19:24:34  <davidjliu> an example of running away before being attacked
2010-11-10T19:24:43  <davidjliu> I'm not sure of how my bot knew to run away that turn though...

2010-11-10T19:25:22  <bhasker_> there starts my bots fall from grace, started going up against Accoun*
2010-11-10T19:25:24  <McLeopold> down 30, 4 away * 5 growth is 10 ships too few
2010-11-10T19:26:42  <davidjliu> I guess I assumed he'd attack me
2010-11-10T19:26:46  <davidjliu> hm, I don't remember coding that

2010-11-10T19:27:44  <davidjliu> wait a moment... if I had reinforced back to my home planet near the end, would I have won?
2010-11-10T19:27:55  <McLeopold> probably not
2010-11-10T19:28:00  <McLeopold> let me analyze...
2010-11-10T19:28:57  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-10T19:29:20  <McLeopold> at turn 13, all your fleets would have been there on the planet
2010-11-10T19:29:21  <bhasker_> mistake was at turn 12
2010-11-10T19:29:27  <bhasker_> you sent  7 ships to acquire a new neutral
2010-11-10T19:29:32  <bhasker_> when you were about to lose a 5 growth
2010-11-10T19:29:40  <McLeopold> but, he may have sent the additional 14 in that case
2010-11-10T19:30:05  <bhasker_> there was no need to acquire neutrals
2010-11-10T19:30:07  <bhasker_> at that turn
2010-11-10T19:30:16  <bhasker_> they were even and he would acquire 1 more extra
2010-11-10T19:30:18  <bhasker_> next turn
2010-11-10T19:30:22  <davidjliu> at turn 9 if I just started sending all of the ships from the 4 growth planet into th 5 growth I think it would've been safe?
2010-11-10T19:30:23  <bhasker_> so he should have launched those 7 at the enemy
2010-11-10T19:30:28  <bhasker_> yes
2010-11-10T19:30:39  <bhasker_> in fact if you had sent the 7
2010-11-10T19:30:41  <bhasker_> from the 4 growth
2010-11-10T19:30:42  <bhasker_> to the 5
2010-11-10T19:30:44  <bhasker_> you would be fine
2010-11-10T19:30:50  <bhasker_> instead of towards a 42 size neutral
2010-11-10T19:30:53  <bhasker_> which you can't acquire
2010-11-10T19:30:57  <davidjliu> yeah...
2010-11-10T19:30:58  <bhasker_> for quite a few turns

2010-11-10T19:32:31  <davidjliu> I think that the optimal strategy on that map may be to overexpand to where your main base isn't completely safe
2010-11-10T19:32:40  <davidjliu> and then do a base-switch thing if the enemy tried to take your base
2010-11-10T19:33:09  <demerzel> mcleopold while you're in an analytical mood tell me why my bot is dumb: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=955040
2010-11-10T19:33:32  <demerzel> knowing that's set to pure greed that is - i know it's not optimal but can't pinpiont it
2010-11-10T19:33:54  <demerzel> kidna wanna get greed as good as i can before trying minimax
2010-11-10T19:33:56  <bhasker_> you are sending ships away
2010-11-10T19:34:01  <bhasker_> from planets which don't have free ships
2010-11-10T19:34:03  <bhasker_> really
2010-11-10T19:34:05  <McLeopold> you should send to a neutral unless you will take it
2010-11-10T19:34:06  <bhasker_> they have fleets incoming
2010-11-10T19:34:13  <bhasker_> and you send them out
2010-11-10T19:34:20  <bhasker_> and yes that, don't send to neutral unless you can take it
2010-11-10T19:34:25  <bhasker_> streaming ships is useless
2010-11-10T19:34:28  <McLeopold> um, shouldn't
2010-11-10T19:34:39  <demerzel> actually if you watch it never sends out enough to get conquered it just leaves nothing there
2010-11-10T19:35:06  <bhasker_> hmm it does send out more
2010-11-10T19:35:09  <demerzel> it's got the capacity to hold back exactly as many as needed for defense but it froze it
2010-11-10T19:35:12  <bhasker_> watch the top right planet
2010-11-10T19:35:13  <bhasker_> of yours
2010-11-10T19:35:21  <bhasker_> at turn 43
2010-11-10T19:35:24  <bhasker_> you send 16 ships out
2010-11-10T19:35:30  <McLeopold> bhasker_: I just royally sniped your bot
2010-11-10T19:35:31  <bhasker_> when there is a 28 size fleet incoming
2010-11-10T19:35:48  <bhasker_> :(
2010-11-10T19:35:55  <demerzel> hmm yea you're right - wonder if that's a fuckit
2010-11-10T19:36:12  <demerzel> it has defense code but if it can't get it there it might just be sending out whatever
2010-11-10T19:36:16  <sigh> a fuckit?
2010-11-10T19:36:18  <demerzel> ty
2010-11-10T19:36:29  <demerzel> as in 'fuckit i'm losing it anyway'
2010-11-10T19:36:37  <sigh> ahh
2010-11-10T19:36:44  <bhasker_> wow it got completely owned mcleopold
2010-11-10T19:36:45  <bhasker_> :(
2010-11-10T19:36:49  <bhasker_> sniped all 3 planets
2010-11-10T19:36:58  <demerzel> that's one thing any max bot will do very well
2010-11-10T19:37:00  <demerzel> snipe
2010-11-10T19:37:06  <McLeopold> and yet, I lose to philic
2010-11-10T19:37:08  <bhasker_> well two
2010-11-10T19:37:13  <McLeopold> O_o
2010-11-10T19:37:14  <demerzel> assuming you put a lower limit on arrival turn that is
2010-11-10T19:37:22  <bhasker_> 4 losses in a row
2010-11-10T19:37:24  <bhasker_> all to snipes

2010-11-10T19:39:26  <bhasker_> demerzel even if you are going to lose the planet
2010-11-10T19:39:30  <bhasker_> its better to keep your ships there i thin
2010-11-10T19:39:37  <bhasker_> it will slow down the incoming fleet
2010-11-10T19:39:42  <bhasker_> otherwise he gets the planet for free
2010-11-10T19:39:48  <bhasker_> and has abig fleet he can send at your planet
2010-11-10T19:40:05  <demerzel> bhasker_ i agree with you, it's def a bug
2010-11-10T19:41:36  <demerzel> i have some code that does a calc on how much enemy fleets can arrive and doesn't allow more than that amount to launch but it totally freezes it when the enemy has more :(
2010-11-10T19:41:41  <demerzel> i need dist code i guess
2010-11-10T19:42:18  <demerzel> the streaming was accidental but i'm having a hard time figuring out why if target a is no longer valuable / attainable why it is better to have launched one massive fleet at it rather than saving the maximum amount by stopping a stream to it
2010-11-10T19:42:49  <demerzel> so i've kept it for the time being

2010-11-10T19:46:00  <demerzel> yea you can see me freeze
2010-11-10T19:46:06  <demerzel> what happened there is a snipe attempt
2010-11-10T19:46:31  <McLeopold> I think you need to look at what it takes to snipe a little better. :P
2010-11-10T19:46:43  <McLeopold> You expansion was just as fast
2010-11-10T19:46:52  <demerzel> nah look at our numbers
2010-11-10T19:46:55  <bhasker_> demerzel i had the same problem, you need to add in support from neutrals
2010-11-10T19:46:59  <bhasker_> that he may acquire in future
2010-11-10T19:47:01  <McLeopold> If you kept the 31, you would have been able to keep up
2010-11-10T19:47:05  <bhasker_> which can send ships
2010-11-10T19:47:06  <demerzel> you had almost 100 ship adv
2010-11-10T19:47:13  <bhasker_> so that you don't try such long shots
2010-11-10T19:47:20  <bhasker_> there is no way that a snipe like that will work
2010-11-10T19:47:27  <bhasker_> against even a half decent bot
2010-11-10T19:47:29  <demerzel> bhasker_ it may have just decided to try to overpower mcleopold and only managed to stream 2 turns
2010-11-10T19:47:40  <bhasker_> you sent at turn 2?
2010-11-10T19:47:42  <demerzel> it wasn't a sniep attempt looking at the log
2010-11-10T19:47:47  <bhasker_> hmm
2010-11-10T19:47:52  <demerzel> it was seriously going to try (with neutrals) to overpower what it currently knew mcleopold could get there
2010-11-10T19:48:05  <demerzel> at that turn, which obv grew exponentially
2010-11-10T19:48:21  <demerzel> i'm not sure hwo to stop that
2010-11-10T19:48:27  <demerzel> since it does consider his neutrals and mine
2010-11-10T19:48:54  <bhasker_> if you were looking at all neutrals
2010-11-10T19:48:58  <bhasker_> there is no way you can get more ships tehre
2010-11-10T19:49:02  <bhasker_> before mcleopold can reinforce
2010-11-10T19:49:27  <demerzel> at that turn no but when it launched it thought so
2010-11-10T19:49:40  <demerzel> it's 4-ply so it may have been turn 20 something it was thinking of
2010-11-10T19:50:18  <demerzel> hmm gonna add a heurhack in haha

2010-11-10T20:46:48  <antimatroid1> would also make the final days of the comp quite interesting with a live leaderboard

2010-11-10T21:22:43  <antimatroid1> the idea would be that once your in the frozen region, that's your final place in the contest
2010-11-10T21:23:05  <davidjliu> as in, when you freeze the bottom half, whether or not you should keep the results of games from teams in the top half against the bottom half for determining ranks in the top half
2010-11-10T21:23:26  <antimatroid1> yeah, i think that'd be best
2010-11-10T21:24:15  <antimatroid1> keep all results, just don't allocate new games to players in the frozen region

2010-11-10T21:35:19  <antimatroid1> as the rankings above the top half change, the rankings in the bottom half are meant to change to account for the change in rankings
2010-11-10T21:35:28  <antimatroid1> perhaps one would have to just clean the slate on games each round
2010-11-10T21:37:39  <davidjliu> heh, yeah, that was one of the issues I was thinking of... but on the other hand, I'm not sure if the final 1 v 2 matchup should just consist of games between 1 and 2
2010-11-10T21:38:09  <davidjliu> because the game isn't transitive and 2 might beat 1 but lose to a lot of other people
2010-11-10T21:38:10  <antimatroid1> davidjliu: i think that idea sucks now, what about a kind of merge sort, every iteration, split the groups in half, till you have groups of about 25-50, then play that for a good day
2010-11-10T21:38:16  <antimatroid1> then that gives final rankings?
2010-11-10T21:40:02  <davidjliu> I'd say that having final groups of size 25-ish is a much better idea than having final groups of size 2, but I think it'd still be a good idea to have more games to accurately determine rankings near the top
2010-11-10T21:40:27  <antimatroid1> run the contest longer
2010-11-10T21:40:48  <davidjliu> there are 4 days according to the website...
2010-11-10T21:42:09  <antimatroid1> okay, i'm going to start a discussion email on the way to get the best possible rankings
2010-11-10T21:42:18  <davidjliu> I'd be more in support of a system where you keep dividing in half except having the last section be the top 25
2010-11-10T21:43:13  <davidjliu> and throw out the old games in consideration of new ranks
2010-11-10T21:43:16  <antimatroid1> so would i personally (hoping i'll be up there), but it may be unfair on other people
2010-11-10T21:43:24  <antimatroid1> who have also posibly spent quite a bit of time working on their bot
2010-11-10T21:45:17  <davidjliu> and maybe there will be enough games to keep the server running for everybody, seeing as they should be able to put up a lot of cloud servers for the official contest period

2010-11-10T22:32:10  <davidjliu> Hm.. one thing I think about "mergesort" (or I guess anti-mergesort) is that you would have a lot of "lost" games, or games that have no bearing on final results
2010-11-10T22:35:51  <antimatroid1> same goes with rounds
2010-11-10T22:36:13  <antimatroid1> i think as is rankings aren't independent of the order of which one wins though
2010-11-10T22:36:17  <antimatroid1> does that make sense?
2010-11-10T22:36:45  <antimatroid1> ideally one would split it up such that bots have at least a day in the final groups playing it out
2010-11-10T22:41:58  <krokkrok> Idealizing the priority of the rank list as a type of mergesort is not very sound.  The whole concept of 'bots with similar ranks' has no meaning until..the rank is determined.
2010-11-10T22:43:06  <davidjliu> There should probably be some parameter in the ranking script that considers in some way uncertainty in rank and uses that to determine which bot to play against
2010-11-10T22:43:13  <davidjliu> er, in the matching script
2010-11-10T22:43:50  <krokkrok> I think rank can only be determined by playing every bot against every other, and the winner is the one with the most total wins.  Every bot must play every other bot or the winner will be determined by random bias in the elo algorithm.  Since this would take too long, it would probably be sufficient to take the top 100 bots and run them all against each other
2010-11-10T22:48:50  <antimatroid1> krokkrok: then use the rounds method
2010-11-10T22:48:56  <antimatroid1> with the final round being a top x round robin

2010-11-10T23:18:12  <dmj111> I think this was the plan at one point... but what about running a swiss tournament over and over again.  with less than 8096 players, each bot would play <= 13 games per round.  The top bots would have to play lower bots, at least the first few rounds, but the last few rounds, everyone would be partitioned pretty good.
2010-11-10T23:18:59  <dmj111> Then, on the next iteration, use the ratings as the seeding order for the next swiss tourney.    Maybe the last day (or half), cut the field down, but spend most of the 4 days letting everyone play.
2010-11-10T23:19:41  <antimatroid1> dmj111: that's what i would like to see
2010-11-10T23:20:03  <antimatroid1> i don't think it's reasonable to cut bots off too early, but it would be nice to get a decent ordering of the top x bots
2010-11-10T23:21:10  <dmj111> yeah.  I mean, that and any bot _could_ lose to any other.  But surely, most of the time, everyone should get games.
2010-11-10T23:21:32  <dmj111> i know that was in the issue tracker, but I didn't look it up before posting.  post first, think later...

2010-11-10T23:28:33  <antimatroid1> i started from a fresh starter pack
2010-11-10T23:28:45  <dmj111> fun.  Still c++?
2010-11-10T23:28:48  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-11-10T23:29:29  <antimatroid1> i gave up on minimax though
2010-11-10T23:29:36  <antimatroid1> i'm doing it entirely heuristic based
2010-11-10T23:29:50  <dmj111> I have been a fan of that approach.
2010-11-10T23:30:27  <antimatroid1> i would do minimax, except i can't do resolutions without having multiple queues being processed at every single resolution
2010-11-10T23:31:06  <antimatroid1> doing that for every future state of every planet for every node just isn't going to work i don't think
2010-11-10T23:31:51  <krokkrok> if you could do minimax i'd think you win easy hehe
2010-11-10T23:32:14  <antimatroid1> no, minimax is easy to implement, implementing it well is the hard part
2010-11-10T23:32:31  <krokkrok> getting it to run in 2 seconds thats the hard part i think ?
2010-11-10T23:32:41  <antimatroid1> i have a bot that can do minimax on both simultaneous and extensive games, it just can't resolve stuff properly
2010-11-10T23:32:45  <antimatroid1> 1 second
2010-11-10T23:32:57  <dmj111> krokkrok: that, and avoiding bugs.
2010-11-10T23:33:22  <sigh> dmj111: are you still heuristic?
2010-11-10T23:34:43  <dmj111> my official bot definitely is.  I have been trying to do a 1ply lookahead type thing.  But it still uses my heuristics for both players.
2010-11-10T23:34:44  <antimatroid1> my gut feeling atm is top bots are going to end up being heuristic ones, but i could be wrong
2010-11-10T23:35:07  <antimatroid1> my gut feeling == best guess
2010-11-10T23:35:16  <antimatroid1> i'm not really a person of "gut feelings"

2010-11-10T23:39:52  * Zannick points at topic "don't ask to ask" :)

2010-11-10T23:40:03  <antimatroid1> that topic is unclear
2010-11-10T23:40:06  <decipher> when i organize the map into an array from 0-22 using getplanet 0-22 i notice a pattern in terms of planet owned from start and how the neutral planets are positioned, but i can put together what the trick behind the array
2010-11-10T23:40:10  <Zannick> in any case
2010-11-10T23:40:27  <Zannick> ah, i can answer this
2010-11-10T23:40:38  <antimatroid1> i can't even understand that :|
2010-11-10T23:40:40  <decipher> i know theres something fishy bout it
2010-11-10T23:40:45  <Zannick> the order of planet ids comes from the map generator, so it's always the same
2010-11-10T23:40:51  <Zannick> 0 is the central planet, and always neutral
2010-11-10T23:40:55  <decipher> based on any distance factor
2010-11-10T23:40:59  <decipher> yeah
2010-11-10T23:41:00  <Zannick> 1 is player 1's planet, 2 is player 2's
2010-11-10T23:41:03  <decipher> i noticed that
2010-11-10T23:41:05  <decipher> yep
2010-11-10T23:41:08  <Zannick> (though you might be player 2)
2010-11-10T23:41:15  <decipher> oh yeah
2010-11-10T23:41:21  <antimatroid1> did we ever get any maps that aren't just symmetric in a 1:1 sense?
2010-11-10T23:41:30  <decipher> no
2010-11-10T23:41:31  <Zannick> and 2x+1 and 2x+2 are mirrors of each other across the center planet
2010-11-10T23:41:34  <decipher> un fair that way
2010-11-10T23:41:44  <decipher> thank you so much zannick
2010-11-10T23:41:44  <Zannick> antimatroid1: the reason for that is the map generator is symmetric
2010-11-10T23:41:49  <decipher> this is the difference
2010-11-10T23:42:07  <sigh> antimatroid1: what do you mean by 1:1 sense?
2010-11-10T23:42:12  <antimatroid1> you can have maps symmetric across three regions and the game still be symmetric
2010-11-10T23:42:16  <antimatroid1> or n regions
2010-11-10T23:42:22  <sigh> oh, no
2010-11-10T23:42:30  <antimatroid1> that would be cool
2010-11-10T23:42:35  <Zannick> you can implement a map generator that does that
2010-11-10T23:42:37  <sigh> someone made one (I think it was bhasker?) but it is not the official
2010-11-10T23:42:42  <decipher> so i need an algorithm to be able to grab the closest planets to me from the central location then go out?
2010-11-10T23:42:44  <Zannick> but you would need sine and cosin
2010-11-10T23:42:48  <Zannick> cosine *
2010-11-10T23:42:52  <antimatroid1> z++ has that in stl :P
2010-11-10T23:42:54  <antimatroid1> c++*
2010-11-10T23:43:19  <Zannick> well, the map generator is python, and math has those, but yes it is possible, just not done
2010-11-10T23:43:22  <krokkrok> hey, how come there is not z++ starter bot??
2010-11-10T23:43:36  <antimatroid1> z++ is a language?, but because no one wrote one
2010-11-10T23:43:38  <Zannick> insufficient interest, possibly
2010-11-10T23:43:50  <Zannick> same reason there's no brainfuck starter bot
