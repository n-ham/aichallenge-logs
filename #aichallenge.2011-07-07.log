2011-07-07T07:13:41  <mleise> using the outlines of water areas to help pathfinding
2011-07-07T07:14:28  <mleise> but what happens to the ant on the last seconds?
2011-07-07T07:15:12  <mcstar> yeah, well its a bug, you should nat have seen it, but i was slow to stop the recording :D
2011-07-07T07:15:27  <mleise> and why does it sometimes walk along the outline when it should have turned to the food
2011-07-07T07:16:09  <mcstar> yeah, it doesnt find the shortest path, the exit condition from the outline is not very sophisticated
2011-07-07T07:16:30  <antimatroid> strange :P
2011-07-07T07:16:51  <mcstar> i wanted to do this: find the paths that you just seen, and then do the same the other way around, that is, from food to ant, and merge the 2 paths
2011-07-07T07:17:17  <mcstar> id get a more optimal paths, but i stopped working on it, and started a* instead
2011-07-07T07:17:44  <mcstar> i just wanted to document the results, but i wont be pursuing this idea
2011-07-07T07:18:36  <mleise> a* has the strong advantage of being optimal and not depending on precalculated data
2011-07-07T07:18:56  <mcstar> well, i dont use optimal a* :)
2011-07-07T07:19:06  <mcstar> i use quite a strong heiristic though
2011-07-07T07:19:25  <mleise> and it is simple enough to let it run over a few hundred squares
2011-07-07T07:19:35  <mcstar> the advantage of a full graph searching is that you always get a PATH, that is, always find your targetr
2011-07-07T07:19:54  <mleise> and a* doesn't?
2011-07-07T07:20:06  <mcstar> no no, i mean exactly a*
2011-07-07T07:20:22  <mleise> a* graph searching ok
2011-07-07T07:20:28  <mcstar> its robust, you can hardly destroy this ability of its
2011-07-07T07:20:48  <mcstar> (this sounds very un-english)
2011-07-07T07:20:57  <mcstar> the ability if her/his
2011-07-07T07:21:04  <mcstar> the ability of her=his
2011-07-07T07:21:07  <mcstar> but, its?
2011-07-07T07:21:31  <mcstar> antimatroid: how does this sound?
2011-07-07T07:21:38  <antimatroid> mcstar: one of my problems is that if i don't want to track collisions other than this turn, then it's faster the "backtrack" the first move needed if i search from the targets to the sources
2011-07-07T07:22:02  <antimatroid> because then i only need to find an adjacent square to the found source with g 1 less
2011-07-07T07:22:56  <mcstar> ah, you dont need the full backtrack
2011-07-07T07:22:59  <mcstar> clever
2011-07-07T07:23:23  <antimatroid> problem with that is my a* heuristic if i have 100's if not 1000's of ants
2011-07-07T07:23:24  <mcstar> but i found that speed-wise it doesnt make a difference
2011-07-07T07:23:39  <mcstar> its not hard to look up a few locations
2011-07-07T07:24:06  <antimatroid> i need to find the manhatten distance for every "target" loc for every location i add to my search queue
2011-07-07T07:24:35  <mcstar> antimatroid: your talking about now the association problem?
2011-07-07T07:25:02  <mcstar> cause in my latest bot i added this functionality
2011-07-07T07:25:08  <mcstar> it uses the Hungarian method
2011-07-07T07:25:17  <mcstar> i couldnt miss this one
2011-07-07T07:25:42  <mcstar> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_method
2011-07-07T07:26:35  <mcstar> i was thinking about pathfinding on this bi-parted graph, the association matrix
2011-07-07T07:26:46  <mcstar> with the manhattan distances on the edges
2011-07-07T07:26:57  <mcstar> but it seemed very difficult to come up with something
2011-07-07T07:27:27  <mcstar> but would have the advantage that it wouldnt have to evaluate all N*M distances
2011-07-07T07:27:56  <mcstar> but the alg. would have been much complicated, so i just went with this method instead, but now i calculate all the food/ant distances
2011-07-07T07:28:42  <mcstar> atm im evaluating spreading tactics
2011-07-07T07:29:03  <mcstar> its slow, but a potential based method is very promising
2011-07-07T07:29:26  <antimatroid> wait what
2011-07-07T07:29:30  <antimatroid> how do you use that?
2011-07-07T07:29:43  <mcstar> which part are you referring?
2011-07-07T07:29:52  <antimatroid> hungarian method
2011-07-07T07:30:23  <mcstar> i use it to associate ants with food squares, the cost is the probable distance the ant would need to travel
2011-07-07T07:30:35  <mcstar> i.e. manhattan
2011-07-07T07:30:50  <antimatroid> hmm, why not just iteratively search from all sources?
2011-07-07T07:31:25  <mcstar> well, i dont want to do superfluous pathfinding
2011-07-07T07:31:44  <antimatroid> i would have thought it was actually just as fast if not faster to do it from all sources
2011-07-07T07:31:46  <antimatroid> at least with a bfs
2011-07-07T07:32:01  <antimatroid> because you find the closest food item first, then keep going with the rest
2011-07-07T07:32:03  <antimatroid> i could be wrong
2011-07-07T07:32:12  <mcstar> are you using parallel pathfinding? from all sources to all target?
2011-07-07T07:32:27  <mcstar> or from one source to all targets?
2011-07-07T07:32:37  <antimatroid> all sources to all targets
2011-07-07T07:32:49  <mcstar> whoa, i didnt realize that
2011-07-07T07:32:50  <antimatroid> i just add all "ants" locations to the search queue, then search out till i find a target
2011-07-07T07:33:38  <antimatroid> once i "collect" food with an ant, i'll also add that ants future location and the "to spawn" ant at the food into the "sources" for collecting the rest of the food, with their g value as when they'll be available, rather than 0
2011-07-07T07:34:23  <mcstar> how are you doing time wise?
2011-07-07T07:34:51  <antimatroid> no idea
2011-07-07T07:35:03  <antimatroid> that's my actual bot, and i just cap it for how long it's allowed to spend on it
2011-07-07T07:35:04  <mcstar> are you well withoin the second?
2011-07-07T07:35:08  <mcstar> aham
2011-07-07T07:35:19  <antimatroid> it usually collects food within 200ms in the worst cases i think
2011-07-07T07:35:30  <antimatroid> but i don't think you really need to leave it running that long
2011-07-07T07:35:39  <antimatroid> it's going to collect the closest food first anyway
2011-07-07T07:37:32  <antimatroid> who is TRavary?

2011-07-07T07:42:30  <antimatroid> mcstar: how much faster is your non-optimal heuristic?
2011-07-07T07:42:37  <antimatroid> the few examples i ran had it almost twice as fast :\
2011-07-07T07:42:47  <mcstar> yeah, at least
2011-07-07T07:43:00  <antimatroid> i think that's amazing
2011-07-07T07:43:03  <antimatroid> i wouldn't have expected that
2011-07-07T07:43:16  <mcstar> on the example map, the we used, i got 10000 searches under 1 sec, in like 0.98sec
2011-07-07T07:43:54  <antimatroid> i would really like to write ai for a full on game
2011-07-07T07:43:56  <mcstar> on the small one, obviously, not the maze
2011-07-07T07:44:01  <antimatroid> maybe i should do the sc ai contest

2011-07-07T11:16:12  <bhasker> initializing maps for example
2011-07-07T11:18:18  <bhasker> c++0x seems to be fixing some of that
2011-07-07T11:20:23  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-07-07T11:21:07  *** amstan_ <amstan_!~alex@142.222.14.91> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
2011-07-07T11:24:03  <bhasker> example in python i could probably just initialize a map like
2011-07-07T11:24:11  <bhasker> or rather dictionary like
2011-07-07T11:24:17  <bhasker> x = { (1,2),... }
2011-07-07T11:24:28  <bhasker> in c++ i have to construct an array of values
2011-07-07T11:24:50  <bhasker> then assign the map like x (&a[0],&a[n]);
2011-07-07T11:25:08  <bhasker> i was hoping c++ 0x wil fix it, but looks like it doesn't
2011-07-07T11:25:27  <bhasker> it adds some new syntax but not for map initialization i guess
2011-07-07T11:25:41  <bhasker> a good source for what c++0x is bringing http://cppannotations.sourceforge.net/cppannotations/html/

2011-07-07T11:28:05  <mleise> shhh
2011-07-07T11:28:05  <bhasker> yes but i have to construct the vector first
2011-07-07T11:28:09  <bhasker> can't do it in a single statement
2011-07-07T11:28:34  <bhasker> and the fact that it causes more copies?
2011-07-07T11:28:42  <antimatroid> what are you making a map of?
2011-07-07T11:28:53  <bhasker> first construct the vectors then the map copies everything form the vector into the map
2011-07-07T11:29:20  <bhasker> if there was syntactic sugar the compiler could probably optimize such stuff away, i guess till maps are made part of the language that won't be possible

2011-07-07T11:34:16  <bhasker> eg

2011-07-07T11:39:56  <mcstar> it is (a+n)
2011-07-07T11:40:05  <bhasker> same thing?
2011-07-07T11:40:08  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-07T11:40:28  <bhasker> i am just used to putting & of operator
2011-07-07T11:40:32  <bhasker> and makes for easier reading
2011-07-07T11:40:34  <mcstar> a is just a (porbably int sized) variable
2011-07-07T11:41:13  <bhasker> if someone is reading its probably clearer when there is an & that its a location being passed in
2011-07-07T11:41:17  <bhasker> and not some value a+n
2011-07-07T11:41:26  <antimatroid> i'm a newb, but function pointers seem to be what i want wrt passing around functions like variables?
2011-07-07T11:41:33  <antimatroid> am i mistaken?
2011-07-07T11:41:36  <bhasker> correct
2011-07-07T11:41:44  <bhasker> or you can use functors
2011-07-07T11:41:47  <antimatroid> c++ just got way better for me :)
2011-07-07T11:41:48  <bhasker> classes that overload ()
2011-07-07T11:41:54  <bhasker> then you can pass objects around
2011-07-07T11:41:57  <mcstar> c has function pointers...
2011-07-07T11:41:59  <bhasker> which can be invoked like a function
2011-07-07T11:42:09  <bhasker> also check out binders

2011-07-07T11:42:47  <mcstar> i dont care, i just said it has function pointers
2011-07-07T11:42:57  <mcstar> obviously c++ must have it too

2011-07-07T11:46:45  <mcstar> but there can be other subtleties
2011-07-07T11:46:58  <mcstar> i dont really know either of them
2011-07-07T11:47:21  <jbroman> I don't recall them off the top of my head, but there are specific cases that are defined in both C and C++ but the defined behaviours are different.

2011-07-07T12:01:47  <VilleH> :) I did mine first snake bot about 15 years ago..
2011-07-07T12:02:38  <mcstar> i didnt know what a computer was 15 years ago
2011-07-07T12:04:56  <bhasker> what do you mean combine functors?
2011-07-07T12:04:59  <antimatroid> mcstar: :P
2011-07-07T12:05:14  * antimatroid wonders how people would do it now?
2011-07-07T12:05:35  <antimatroid> i'd just have a "direction" at each location visited and know where to find the head
2011-07-07T12:05:41  <mcstar> bhasker: a functor in cpp is a higher order function, which takes functions as arguments, right?
2011-07-07T12:06:28  <bhasker> nope
2011-07-07T12:06:37  <bhasker> functor in C++ is an object that can be invoked like a funciton

2011-07-07T12:09:42  <mcstar> i think thats exactly what i meant
2011-07-07T12:11:30  <mcstar> it is interesting though that its not part of the language
2011-07-07T12:11:43  <mcstar> i mean this is defined through stl right?
2011-07-07T12:12:32  <jbroman> mcstar: You don't need STL to make functors . . . you just overload operator() on some class.
2011-07-07T12:12:51  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-07T12:18:02  <mcstar> i see, c++ doesnt have closure
2011-07-07T12:18:12  <mcstar> so it needs to emulate it with classes
2011-07-07T12:19:47  <jbroman> mcstar: Yeah, functional programming in C++ is awkward, which is why it is not done as often.
