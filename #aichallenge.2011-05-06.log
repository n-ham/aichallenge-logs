2011-05-06T03:00:48  <antimatroid> ... i have found one correct definition of symmetric games other than mine
2011-05-06T03:01:03  <antimatroid> it's slightly different, and no surprises that von neumann made no mistake

2011-05-06T12:22:45  <antimatroid> mcstar: hey
2011-05-06T12:22:49  <antimatroid> i just found something quite straing
2011-05-06T12:22:52  <antimatroid> strange* :P
2011-05-06T12:24:56  <mcstar> well, for me the whole wrestling business is strange
2011-05-06T12:25:10  <mcstar> i think its a bad joke
2011-05-06T12:25:19  <mcstar> i dont like it
2011-05-06T12:25:34  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-05-06T12:25:53  <antimatroid> you don't like the analogy "wrestling a problem"?
2011-05-06T12:25:59  <mcstar> when two big guy try to mate on tv
2011-05-06T12:26:13  <mcstar> im just saying i dont like wrestling
2011-05-06T12:26:20  <antimatroid> i don't like wrestling either
2011-05-06T12:26:22  <mcstar> professional wrestling
2011-05-06T12:26:28  <antimatroid> but i like saying wrestling with a problem :P
2011-05-06T12:26:42  <mcstar> and, it was a joke to ur figure of speach
2011-05-06T12:26:51  <antimatroid> if you take a 2x2 game, you would expect the following to result in the same game yes...
2011-05-06T12:27:20  <antimatroid> swap the players then swap new player 2's strategies
2011-05-06T12:27:20  <antimatroid> swap player 1's strategies then swap the players
2011-05-06T12:28:14  <mcstar> well in a formula:
2011-05-06T12:28:16  <antimatroid> not the original game, but both things would intuitively lead to the same thing, but on paper it's not :\
2011-05-06T12:28:29  <mcstar> A|B=B^t|A^t
2011-05-06T12:28:35  <mcstar> if this holds its symmetric
2011-05-06T12:28:54  <mcstar> of course you dont know what | means
2011-05-06T12:28:55  <antimatroid> i'm not worrying about symmetry atm
2011-05-06T12:28:59  <mcstar> bc i just introduced it
2011-05-06T12:30:05  <mcstar> well
2011-05-06T12:30:11  <mcstar> swap the 2 players
2011-05-06T12:30:27  <mcstar> then transpose its utility matrices
2011-05-06T12:30:32  <mcstar> then swap their strategies
2011-05-06T12:30:51  <mcstar> and this results in the same payoff matrix
2011-05-06T12:30:59  <mcstar> if and only if the game was symmetric
2011-05-06T12:31:04  <mcstar> this i know
2011-05-06T12:31:10  <mcstar> bc i tried
2011-05-06T12:31:31  <mcstar> its->their
2011-05-06T12:32:47  <mcstar> well, transposing and swapping arent teh same
2011-05-06T12:34:51  <antimatroid> oh wait, i fucked up :P
2011-05-06T12:35:22  <mcstar> how so?
2011-05-06T12:35:31  <antimatroid> i didn't swap the players properly
2011-05-06T12:35:46  <antimatroid> it i start with :
2011-05-06T12:35:46  <antimatroid> 1,8 2,6
2011-05-06T12:35:46  <antimatroid> 3,7 4,5
2011-05-06T12:36:04  <antimatroid> swapping players then a1 and a2 is the same as swapping a1 and a2 then swapping the players
2011-05-06T12:36:42  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-06T12:36:57  <antimatroid> i was going wtf as to why i was getting a different result :P
2011-05-06T12:36:57  <mcstar> these are not interdependent
2011-05-06T12:37:34  <antimatroid> atm i'm working on a definition to say two games are equivalent
2011-05-06T12:37:55  <antimatroid> with my whole "unravelling' of the tensor thing
2011-05-06T12:42:55  <mcstar> so after your aforementioned method, you expect to get back the same payoff matrix?
2011-05-06T12:43:16  <antimatroid> no
2011-05-06T12:43:23  <antimatroid> i expected the two methods to give the same result
2011-05-06T12:43:36  <antimatroid> but the resulting game is equivalent to the starting game
2011-05-06T12:43:47  <mcstar> before that
2011-05-06T12:43:54  <antimatroid> ?

2011-05-06T16:12:16  <janzert> I'm *really* unhappy to see so many gratuitous changes especially when we should be on the verge of pushing out beta and they include regressions to at least stderr handling in the sandbox, but I'm going to try and get compilation sandboxing integrated this weekend and that will probably be the last of what I do so feel free to do what you want I suppose

2011-05-06T18:28:22  <McLeopold1> amstan: I need help
2011-05-06T18:28:28  <amstan> McLeopold1: ok?
2011-05-06T18:29:04  <McLeopold1> I don't have time to do some of the php ranking pages.
2011-05-06T18:29:16  <McLeopold1> It's easy, I just haven't got there yet.
2011-05-06T18:29:27  <amstan> McLeopold1: i need some filled tables then
2011-05-06T18:30:41  <McLeopold1> amstan: sql/create_test_data will get you data
2011-05-06T18:30:51  <amstan> ok
2011-05-06T18:31:11  <McLeopold1> I think all the mu/sigma will still be at default values, but at least you'll have entries.
2011-05-06T18:31:19  <amstan> McLeopold1: i'll look into it tonight
2011-05-06T18:31:22  <McLeopold1> cool
2011-05-06T18:31:29  <McLeopold1> I'm working on manager.py...
2011-05-06T18:31:59  <McLeopold1> which should update the trueskill values after a game, and snapshot the rankings to create the leaderboard records

2011-05-06T18:32:43  <McLeopold1> I think the mysql issue had to do with transactions in the api_game_result, so I've removed them
2011-05-06T18:32:58  <McLeopold1> after beta, we'll need to address it
2011-05-06T18:34:35  <McLeopold1> amstan/janzert: I'm not trying to do gratuitous changes, I'm just trying to do enough that I know stuff is working.  The front page stuff was a quick fix since I don't have ranking pages yet.
2011-05-06T18:36:13  <McLeopold1> janzert: also, stderr changes were made so I could get feed back to the workers.  It did feel like I was going backwards.

2011-05-06T18:45:39  <_flag> What's the status on a beta/tcp_server/contest_start_date?
2011-05-06T18:45:51  <McLeopold1> beta is close
2011-05-06T18:46:06  <McLeopold1> tcp_server is not a priority, although I've posted a start of a python one

2011-05-06T18:46:24  <_flag> What's wrong with the old C one?
2011-05-06T18:46:31  <McLeopold1> It's not multiplayer
2011-05-06T18:46:48  <McLeopold1> but there is less wrong with it than my current python attempt

2011-05-06T19:46:00  <amstan> well..
2011-05-06T19:46:11  <amstan> ubuntu really doesn't like me, it broke a ton of things in the update
2011-05-06T19:46:17  * amstan is never updating again like that
2011-05-06T19:47:48  <McLeopold1> I just updated my desktop last night.  I seems closer to OSX
2011-05-06T19:48:11  <amstan> i run kde, so i didn't get the unity stuff
2011-05-06T19:48:14  <McLeopold1> with the common menu bar at the top
2011-05-06T19:48:19  <McLeopold1> ah
2011-05-06T19:48:38  <amstan> the google-talk-plugin broke the flash package, so it brought down the whole upgrade process
2011-05-06T19:48:49  <McLeopold1> ouch
2011-05-06T19:48:50  <amstan> the nvidia driver was disabled, and now refuses to reenable
2011-05-06T19:49:03  <amstan> and the broadcom driver didn't want to get installed either
2011-05-06T19:49:34  <amstan> i ran the system after the upgrade a few days with sleep and so on, since i didn't wanna reboot
2011-05-06T19:49:40  <amstan> but when i rebooted everything was down
2011-05-06T19:49:45  <amstan> so.. i might as well reinstall
2011-05-06T19:49:51  <amstan> i have all the debs downloaded
2011-05-06T19:50:08  <McLeopold1> next github push does trueskill updates \o/
2011-05-06T19:50:25  <amstan> woot
2011-05-06T19:50:55  <McLeopold1> did you see my message about my mysql issues?
2011-05-06T19:51:01  <McLeopold1> I think it was transaction stuff
2011-05-06T19:51:08  <amstan> yeah, i saw that
2011-05-06T19:51:25  * McLeopold1 will leave the php hate diatrib in the comments

2011-05-06T20:40:02  <McLeopold_> um, it should just work

2011-05-06T23:03:00  <antimatroid> slightly different actually
2011-05-06T23:03:26  <antimatroid> you have 3 rectangular grids on the edges of a traingle, then the middle is triangle squares
2011-05-06T23:04:03  <sigh> ah... good old triangle squares
2011-05-06T23:04:18  <antimatroid> i am drawing myself a board now

2011-05-06T23:11:00  <amstan_> what about hexagonal pieces in the middle?
2011-05-06T23:11:16  <amstan_> also.. this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_player_chess
2011-05-06T23:11:16  <antimatroid> i actually quite like this triangle way
