2011-05-10T00:00:01  <McLeopold> where does your bot dir go?
2011-05-10T00:00:23  <McLeopold> the uploaded file shouldn't be in the compiled dir, just the uploaded one
2011-05-10T00:00:44  <janzert> well the worker will be getting it from the manager
2011-05-10T00:00:55  <McLeopold> and shouldn't the bot dir be outside the submission dir?  if you are worried about clobbering stuff?
2011-05-10T00:01:12  <janzert> no
2011-05-10T00:01:25  <janzert> the upload get's unpacked into the bot dir
2011-05-10T00:01:34  <McLeopold> ooooooohhh
2011-05-10T00:01:43  <janzert> the only thing that then writes/makes changes there is the compilation process and the bot itself
2011-05-10T00:03:11  <janzert> does that clear it up?
2011-05-10T00:03:57  <McLeopold> thinking
2011-05-10T00:04:09  <McLeopold> the worker needs to download an entry file...

2011-05-10T00:05:26  <McLeopold> where does the temp worker dir go?  That's what I was using downloaded for
2011-05-10T00:05:29  <janzert> I think I'd rather not, just because I'd like combined setups not to work too differently from separate machines
2011-05-10T00:05:50  <janzert> the temp dir is created directly in the compiled/ dir
2011-05-10T00:06:55  <McLeopold> those are really easy changes to worker
2011-05-10T00:07:42  <janzert> there are python functions to make sure you get a unique temp directory too without a race condition
2011-05-10T00:07:52  <janzert> looking that up now since I can't remember the name offhand ;)

2011-05-10T00:11:27  <McLeopold> janzert: is there an easy way to run the setup script without messing with install and jail users, so I can test dir changes?
2011-05-10T00:12:14  <janzert> worker_setup?
2011-05-10T00:13:38  <janzert> I think it should be safe to run it multiple times and it will skip the parts it thinks are already done
2011-05-10T00:14:06  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-10T00:14:07  <janzert> that isn't really tested much though, so I wouldn't be too surprised if it runs into a problem
2011-05-10T00:14:13  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-10T00:14:24  <amstan> janzert: it'll skip installing /srv/chroot if it sees it's present, it'll jump directly to jail users setup
2011-05-10T00:14:27  <janzert> but I would guess worst case is that it will either error out or add duplicate lines to some files

2011-05-10T00:16:23  <janzert> add an if file_contains("/etc/passwd", username): return check to the top of create_jail_user should fix that

2011-05-10T00:30:45  <McLeopold> do you really want to keep the uploaded zip on the worker?
2011-05-10T00:30:49  <McLeopold> janzert: ^^
2011-05-10T00:33:13  <janzert> I don't think I really care one way or the other at this point
2011-05-10T00:33:33  <janzert> deleting it after unpacking would be fine but if you don't want to add that I'm fine with that too
2011-05-10T00:33:58  <janzert> mostly I just wanted to show that it should be outside the bot directory
2011-05-10T00:34:12  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-10T00:35:41  <janzert> the worker temporary files you're talking about games/ are game replays it is sending to the manager?
2011-05-10T00:35:55  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-10T00:36:15  <McLeopold> wait...
2011-05-10T00:36:18  <janzert> ok, just concerned about what we put in there since we are planning on exposing it publically
2011-05-10T00:36:20  <McLeopold> but it couldn't be shared
2011-05-10T00:36:31  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-10T00:36:52  <janzert> why can't playgame just return it directly to worker.py and it send it directly without ever hitting a disk?
2011-05-10T00:36:53  <McLeopold> I want a place for the worker to store results when it can't communicate with the server
2011-05-10T00:37:07  <janzert> but it'll only ever have one result
2011-05-10T00:37:11  <janzert> in that state
2011-05-10T00:37:22  <janzert> so just keep it in memory?
2011-05-10T00:38:03  <McLeopold> yeah, ok
2011-05-10T00:38:58  <janzert> btw, what is the game directory structure?
2011-05-10T00:39:24  <janzert> since it's going to have literally a million files or so :}
2011-05-10T00:39:48  <janzert> maybe more
2011-05-10T00:41:44  <amstan> janzert: with the mod 1000 thing
2011-05-10T00:42:44  <janzert> hierarchical unlike the submissions though?
2011-05-10T00:43:41  <janzert> i.e. games/<gameid % 1000>/<gameid % 1000000>/ (and actually steps of 100 might be better)
2011-05-10T00:44:02  <janzert> and submissions are division
2011-05-10T00:44:05  <McLeopold> I do want them to be permalinks
2011-05-10T00:44:48  <McLeopold> why is 100 better?
2011-05-10T00:46:12  <janzert> I guess even % 1000 is still a maximum of 1998(?) files in a single directory

2011-05-10T00:47:55  <janzert> just be some long ls output :}
2011-05-10T00:48:12  <McLeopold> true
2011-05-10T00:48:20  <McLeopold> but I don't think we care too much
2011-05-10T00:48:51  <McLeopold> it would be nice to get a url rewrite to make the links look nice
2011-05-10T00:49:58  <janzert> I would think that should be fairly easy to add to the apache configuration
2011-05-10T00:50:04  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-10T00:50:17  <McLeopold> so, double directories for the games, single for the submissions
2011-05-10T00:50:36  <McLeopold> every thing is at the same level, so /home/contest/games/0/0/0.replay
2011-05-10T00:51:17  <janzert> ahh, I was picturing expanding levels as the gameid increased
2011-05-10T00:51:34  <janzert> hence the ~2x number of entries per directory
2011-05-10T00:51:46  <McLeopold> which is why I clarified :)
2011-05-10T00:52:07  <janzert> but yeah I doubt we'll ever get to a third level at steps of 1000x
2011-05-10T00:53:02  <janzert> so fixed two levels deep is almost certainly easier to work with
2011-05-10T00:53:35  <McLeopold> it would be /home/contest/games/10000/0/10000000000.replay
2011-05-10T00:53:51  <janzert> and if it's fixed you might as well use division instead of mod

2011-05-10T01:23:37  <janzert> yes
2011-05-10T01:24:42  <McLeopold> then, we don't need a "root_path" var in any of the server_setup files

2011-05-10T01:25:19  <janzert> the sandbox needs it on the worker
2011-05-10T01:25:40  <McLeopold> but, it has a repo path, so we could just make that absolute
2011-05-10T01:25:50  <janzert> but yeah, looks like it could go away on the manager
2011-05-10T01:26:28  <McLeopold> repo_path and root_path are only used once in sandbox, and together
2011-05-10T01:26:38  <janzert> yeah, just looking at it
2011-05-10T01:27:09  <janzert> yes I suppose making all the paths absolute and getting rid of root path would work fine
2011-05-10T01:27:16  <janzert> probably a little better even
2011-05-10T01:28:52  <McLeopold> should I delete bayeselo stuff?
2011-05-10T01:29:28  <McLeopold> I'm going to move it into a bayeselo folder for now
2011-05-10T01:29:44  <janzert> no don't move it get rid of it if it's been fully replaced
2011-05-10T01:29:59  <janzert> only leave old stuff it is something that we still need to write a replacement for
2011-05-10T01:30:30  <janzert> just so we can easily look at how it used to be done when writing the replacement
2011-05-10T01:30:35  <McLeopold> but, for future contest, we might use it
2011-05-10T01:30:39  <janzert> and remind us that we still need to do it :)
2011-05-10T01:30:57  <McLeopold> if we ever do another 1v1 game
2011-05-10T01:30:59  <janzert> at that point someone can dig it out of the history

2011-05-10T01:31:20  <janzert> but I think the structure has changed so much that it will be of little use anyway
2011-05-10T01:31:39  <McLeopold> can gmail.py be removed from manager?
2011-05-10T01:32:02  <janzert> and right now even if we went back to a 1v1 game I'd rather stick with an incremental rating system like trueskill just for the performance benefits
2011-05-10T01:32:37  <janzert> hmm, I can't think of any time the manager itself needs to send an email
2011-05-10T01:32:56  <janzert> the worker sends the emails on submission compilation/testing failure right?
2011-05-10T01:33:03  <McLeopold> I've never even looked at the emails we send
2011-05-10T01:33:07  <janzert> and php sends it on upload failures
2011-05-10T01:34:01  <janzert> how about successful submission emails, I suppose the worker sends those at well?
2011-05-10T01:34:33  <janzert> account confirmation and submission success/failure emails are the only ones I can think of offhand
2011-05-10T01:35:46  <McLeopold> right now, the worker doesn't do emails
2011-05-10T01:36:14  <McLeopold> I've never setup a test smtp/sendmail server to look at it
2011-05-10T01:36:52  <janzert> yeah, we'll need to get that working one way or the other at some point
2011-05-10T01:36:55  <McLeopold> looks like I just import gmail and call one function
2011-05-10T01:37:19  <janzert> if you haven't noticed the gmail module is really misnamed

2011-05-10T01:37:40  <McLeopold> yeah, I was just thinking that :)
2011-05-10T01:37:42  <janzert> gmail limits to sending a few hundred emails per day and that wasn't enough for the contest
2011-05-10T01:37:52  <McLeopold> hard coded to smtp.gmail.com:587
2011-05-10T01:38:18  <janzert> where?
2011-05-10T01:38:22  <McLeopold> does amazon have a relay we can use?
2011-05-10T01:38:25  <janzert> it should be pulling it out of server_info
2011-05-10T01:38:51  <janzert> they introduced a "simple mail service" a few months ago with 2000 free messages sent per day
2011-05-10T01:39:01  <janzert> but I haven't looked into the details yet
2011-05-10T01:39:31  <McLeopold> what if we just didn't do email?
2011-05-10T01:39:35  <janzert> my understanding is we can configure the server so our code can still do a straight smtp send with the local server
2011-05-10T01:39:46  <janzert> it'd be a lot easier :)
2011-05-10T01:39:58  <janzert> I'm not sure how much of an uproar it would create though
2011-05-10T01:40:11  <janzert> also we probably want to keep the account confirmation emails at least?
2011-05-10T01:40:19  <McLeopold> why?
2011-05-10T01:40:28  <McLeopold> that's only used to confirm you own the email address
2011-05-10T01:40:49  <McLeopold> if we don't send emails, we don't need to confirm anything
2011-05-10T01:41:07  <janzert> hmm, and don't collect emails at all
2011-05-10T01:41:17  <janzert> but then we'll have no way to contact participants
2011-05-10T01:41:26  <McLeopold> so, the user would just need a submission status page
2011-05-10T01:41:32  <janzert> I guess bring it up with amstan
2011-05-10T01:41:43  <McLeopold> I'm not sure what we need to contact them for.
2011-05-10T01:42:22  <janzert> they won, they are killing our servers and we're throwing the present submission out, etc. ;)
2011-05-10T01:42:25  <janzert> but yeah
2011-05-10T01:42:40  <McLeopold> submission status page
2011-05-10T01:42:45  <janzert> I'm not too opposed to doing away with it
2011-05-10T01:42:59  <McLeopold> okay, if amstan agrees, it would be an easier setup
2011-05-10T01:43:15  <janzert> actually I just thought of something, I have a feeling j3camero will be opposed to dropping it
2011-05-10T01:43:16  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-05-10T01:43:22  <McLeopold> lost password
2011-05-10T01:43:32  <janzert> yeah, that is another problem
2011-05-10T01:44:23  <janzert> the google sponsorship comes from their headhunters and j3camero usually sends an email out to the top competitors towards the end of the contest asking if they'd like to be contacted by a recruiter
2011-05-10T01:44:52  <janzert> so without an email address google might not be as enthused about the sponsorship
2011-05-10T01:45:06  <McLeopold> I guess I didn't make the cut last time :p
2011-05-10T01:45:23  <janzert> heh
2011-05-10T01:45:42  <janzert> I'm not actually sure he did it last time
2011-05-10T01:45:58  <janzert> I did get one with the tron contest
2011-05-10T01:46:29  <janzert> I guess it'd be something we'd need to find out from him
2011-05-10T01:46:48  <McLeopold> okay, well, at least for lost password issues, email is good, so let's keep it
2011-05-10T01:46:56  <janzert> but even without that password reset does seem like a good reason to keep it as well
2011-05-10T01:47:05  * janzert nods
2011-05-10T01:47:33  <McLeopold> I only submitted twice last contest, which is why I don't remember getting too many emails
2011-05-10T01:48:44  <McLeopold> submissions_path is going away in the server_info files, to be replaced with upload_dir and compiled_dir
2011-05-10T01:48:51  <McLeopold> err *_path
2011-05-10T01:49:12  <janzert> sounds fine
2011-05-10T01:57:30  <McLeopold> janzert: do you care where log files go
2011-05-10T01:58:12  <janzert> a consolidated log directory would be nice, but it's fine if that doesn't happen
2011-05-10T02:18:29  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm thinking we don't want MultiViews for the apache setup
2011-05-10T02:23:27  <janzert> the current apache config is a barely modified default configuration, there is pretty certainly a lot that should change
2011-05-10T02:23:37  <janzert> feel free to work on it
2011-05-10T02:25:10  <antimatroid> i got the email for tron
2011-05-10T02:25:24  <antimatroid> McLeopold: we weren't in the top 50 even towards the end though?

2011-05-10T02:44:39  <McLeopold> a mistake
2011-05-10T02:44:45  <McLeopold> ignore it
2011-05-10T02:45:09  <Ice_Harley> mistake, that will be fixed?
2011-05-10T02:45:18  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-10T02:45:31  <McLeopold> it was an idea, but we decided it added to much complexity
2011-05-10T02:45:42  <McLeopold> to the spec
2011-05-10T02:46:09  <antimatroid> i am slow to fixing the c++ bot
2011-05-10T02:46:17  <antimatroid> sorry, they are going to be removed
2011-05-10T02:47:10  <Ice_Harley> it's a pity. I think "r" lines are useful

2011-05-10T02:50:06  <McLeopold> but if you can do a good bot, you can calculate it yourself by calculating your vision
2011-05-10T02:52:33  <Ice_Harley> I will, but i'll spend part of MY second on it
2011-05-10T02:52:56  <McLeopold> :)

2011-05-10T02:58:44  <JaycobColeman> Is anyone here doing heritage health prize?

2011-05-10T03:00:09  <JaycobColeman> haha, that's nice

2011-05-10T18:21:16  <McLeopold> depending on the language, plus the engine
2011-05-10T18:21:49  <McLeopold> what about full starter packs, but the quick start guide says to download, extract and upload the MyBot.tgz located inside the pack.
2011-05-10T18:22:10  <McLeopold> And we reject full starter packs.
2011-05-10T18:22:37  <McLeopold> so, each starter pack can have a build script that produces the smaller MyBot file
2011-05-10T18:23:03  <McLeopold> I know jeff wants *really* easy, and I'm wondering if that would be easy enough.
2011-05-10T18:23:18  <janzert> I'm still a little confused I guess
2011-05-10T18:24:07  <McLeopold> how so?
2011-05-10T18:24:11  <janzert> mainly I think jeff wants to be able to take the downloaded package and a) run a game with it locally without other dependancies and b) be able to upload it to the server and have an entry
2011-05-10T18:24:30  <janzert> what is "the smaller MyBot file"?
2011-05-10T18:25:04  <McLeopold> we don't want users uploading hugh sets of files that really aren't part of the bot
2011-05-10T18:25:17  <janzert> I think splitting the download into two files one with the generic engine, viewer and such and one for each language starter bot is a good idea
2011-05-10T18:25:55  <McLeopold> Okay, but the starter pack creators also want to create tools for their language
2011-05-10T18:27:06  <McLeopold> So each language would have their own tools files.
2011-05-10T18:27:24  <janzert> I think that is probably fine, so long as they keep a fairly orderly directory structure that makes it obvious what is part of the bot
2011-05-10T18:27:58  <janzert> also I would try and keep the main packs c++, java, python fairly minimal
2011-05-10T18:28:09  <McLeopold> our build script needs to create 2 zip files then, and know which parts to take from the starter pack dir
2011-05-10T18:28:15  <janzert> those will cover almost all the entries anyway
2011-05-10T18:28:21  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-10T18:28:24  <McLeopold> they are right now
2011-05-10T18:28:26  <janzert> especially the ones by newbies
2011-05-10T18:28:48  <janzert> the more esoteric languages I expect will have users more likely to understand what they have
2011-05-10T18:29:02  <McLeopold> I disagree with that
2011-05-10T18:29:19  <McLeopold> I wouldn't mind trying out lisp or haskell this time around, but the starter packs were beasts
2011-05-10T18:29:59  <janzert> but you would still understand pretty quickly what parts of it were tools and what was the actual bot I imagine
2011-05-10T18:30:09  <McLeopold> I can't look at the lisp starter and learn lisp
2011-05-10T18:30:18  <McLeopold> I really had a hard time with the lisp one, so no
2011-05-10T18:30:34  <janzert> I can't look at most any lisp and learn lisp ;)
2011-05-10T18:30:52  <janzert> perl is almost easier to learn by reading :P
2011-05-10T18:31:23  <McLeopold> anyway, when it comes to building starter packs and tool sets, I'm thinking each language will get one of each...
2011-05-10T18:31:39  <McLeopold> And we need to impose some structure on the starter bot writers
2011-05-10T18:32:11  <janzert> people did fine without that in the past
2011-05-10T18:32:27  <janzert> consistent structure in starter bots that is
2011-05-10T18:32:51  <McLeopold> perhaps, or maybe people just gave up and didn't complain
2011-05-10T18:33:17  <janzert> personally I'd rather idiomatic starter bots, i.e. written the way a programmer experienced in the language would naturally write it
2011-05-10T18:33:39  <McLeopold> yes, that is good for learning
2011-05-10T18:34:00  <McLeopold> but we still need a way to separate tools and extra stuff from what should be submitted in a zip file
2011-05-10T18:34:05  <janzert> that was something I really disliked about the python and java starter packs in the past
2011-05-10T18:34:29  <McLeopold> oh yeah, the python starter was written in java :p
2011-05-10T18:34:52  <McLeopold> 1 class per file and such
2011-05-10T18:34:54  <janzert> well, that just entails telling the authors to have a tools directory and a bot directory right?
2011-05-10T18:35:13  <McLeopold> something like that, which is why I wanted your opinion
2011-05-10T18:35:25  <janzert> yeah, and while I'm not as familiar with Java people were complaining about the same sort of thing with that one
2011-05-10T18:35:29  <McLeopold> or some way for them to declare what goes where
2011-05-10T18:35:54  <janzert> ok, I don't have a real problem with that sort of structure
2011-05-10T18:36:10  <janzert> I thought you meant the structure of the bot program itself
2011-05-10T18:36:14  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-10T18:36:24  <McLeopold> just enough for our build scripts to be smart
2011-05-10T18:36:57  <janzert> it might be best to have a per bot, either makefile or build script
2011-05-10T18:37:05  <McLeopold> probably
2011-05-10T18:37:44  <McLeopold> require something that will produce the 2 zips if not in a dir structure?
2011-05-10T18:38:11  <janzert> have a recommended dir structure and a required script
2011-05-10T18:39:26  <janzert> I'd keep the language neutral stuff (engine, visualizer, etc.) as its own download too
2011-05-10T18:40:10  <janzert> and all a person has to download is the engine pack and a starter bot, they can get the language specific tools if or when they want
2011-05-10T18:40:56  <McLeopold> I'm thinking the tools pack can be rolled in with the language tools.
2011-05-10T18:41:16  <McLeopold> That way if someone produces a java engine and java playgame, then they can include that instead.
2011-05-10T18:41:32  <McLeopold> This might be stuff for zeta.
2011-05-10T18:41:42  <janzert> that complicates the language packaging though and I want everyone to have the same "official" engine
2011-05-10T18:41:55  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-05-10T18:42:09  <McLeopold> what if we had 2 official engines?
2011-05-10T18:42:32  <janzert> that's the what happened in the past and I'd rather avoid that
2011-05-10T18:42:32  <McLeopold> we'd have to have pretty good unit tests for that
2011-05-10T18:42:41  <McLeopold> why avoid?
2011-05-10T18:43:13  <janzert> the problem is that we always end up with bugs/slight differences in behavior on edge cases that confuse people until we get it fixed
2011-05-10T18:43:30  <McLeopold> I can see that, thus the unit tests
2011-05-10T18:43:55  <janzert> even with unit tests I think we'll always miss something

2011-05-10T18:44:38  <janzert> but what do we gain by having more than one?
2011-05-10T18:44:54  <McLeopold> maybe someone doesn't want to install python
2011-05-10T18:45:25  <janzert> anymore the only people that don't have it already is windows
2011-05-10T18:45:51  <McLeopold> a c++ engine could be much faster, allowing for faster training/testing
2011-05-10T18:45:55  <janzert> and it's an easy install compared to most other languages
2011-05-10T18:46:20  <janzert> I'd let the community create that
2011-05-10T18:46:20  <McLeopold> this worker install takes forever...
2011-05-10T18:46:26  <janzert> yep
2011-05-10T18:46:54  <janzert> its gotta do a full OS install and then the compiled languages take quite a while
2011-05-10T18:47:16  <janzert> finding ppa's with precompiled packages for all the languages would be really nice
2011-05-10T18:47:23  <McLeopold> ppa?
