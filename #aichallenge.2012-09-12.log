2012-09-12T08:11:02  <antimatroidl> mcstar: i am sitting next to my desktop running with zero idea of how to try and get my wireless working :P
2012-09-12T08:11:32  <antimatroidl> all i remember was i want b94-legacy instead of b94 but don't seem to even have logs of our convo
2012-09-12T08:11:43  <mcstar> and you love those situations, dont you?
2012-09-12T08:11:49  <antimatroidl> nope :(
2012-09-12T08:11:59  <antimatroidl> but first time free since last time so thought i might as well pull it out
2012-09-12T08:12:05  <mcstar> then, what you have is a 'problem', in thechincal terms
2012-09-12T08:12:18  <antimatroidl> what are some terms i can google?
2012-09-12T08:12:20  <mcstar> b43-legacy
2012-09-12T08:12:27  <antimatroidl> ah haha
2012-09-12T08:12:32  <antimatroidl> that would explain my google fail
2012-09-12T08:12:40  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-12T08:20:45  <mcstar> antimatroidl: just a reminder, you have to keep b43 from auto-loading, that is your task
2012-09-12T08:21:17  <mcstar> if  you manage, and then load b43-legacy, and you still cant 'sudo ifconfig wlan0 up', talk to me
2012-09-12T08:22:06  <mcstar> as long as you cant issue that command wo errors, it means something is borken
2012-09-12T08:22:12  <mcstar> pun indented
2012-09-12T08:26:37  <antimatroidl> how do i try and stop b43 from auto-loading?
2012-09-12T08:26:51  <antimatroidl> i'm happy to let you remote in if you have time :)
2012-09-12T08:28:50  <mcstar> antimatroidl: it involves restarts, and the connection would break, and there can be complications, like the router blocking ports and such
2012-09-12T08:29:12  <mcstar> you have to properly set up the blacklist file
2012-09-12T08:29:24  <antimatroidl> i can forward ports easily enough
2012-09-12T08:29:28  <antimatroidl> but yeah would be a pita
2012-09-12T08:37:50  <antimatroidl> mcstar: i'm pretty lost :P
2012-09-12T08:38:05  <antimatroidl> http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Switching_between_drivers not sure if that'd help or not
2012-09-12T08:38:25  <antimatroidl> should i do echo "blacklist b43" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist?
2012-09-12T08:39:23  <mcstar> antimatroidl: no
2012-09-12T08:39:36  <mcstar> first of all, the file is called blacklist.conf afaik
2012-09-12T08:39:41  <mcstar> on buntu
2012-09-12T08:40:04  <mcstar> you can try manually unloading the modules, like it says on the page
2012-09-12T08:40:19  <mcstar> we did it last time, and it didnt help
2012-09-12T08:40:26  <mcstar> maybe you will be luckier this time
2012-09-12T08:41:34  <antimatroidl> mcstar: can you give me an overview again in a shared doc where i ask you questions? :P
2012-09-12T08:42:01  <mcstar> antimatroidl: start sshd

2012-09-12T09:48:31  <mcstar> what now?
2012-09-12T09:49:15  <antimatroidl> here's what i did...
2012-09-12T09:49:42  <antimatroidl> i went to additional hardware and changed the NVIDIA thing to the recommended one and restarted
2012-09-12T09:49:54  <antimatroidl> then it doesn't come up with any wireless stuff anymore :|
2012-09-12T09:49:58  <antimatroidl> they should be unrelated right?
2012-09-12T09:50:03  <antimatroidl> i restarted again and nothing
2012-09-12T09:50:46  <mcstar> antimatroidl: did you set up your connection before?
2012-09-12T09:50:57  <mcstar> ah right, you did
2012-09-12T09:51:00  <antimatroidl> yeah
2012-09-12T09:51:03  <mcstar> well, you need to save it
2012-09-12T09:51:06  <mcstar> or whatever
2012-09-12T09:51:10  <mcstar> how did you do it?
2012-09-12T09:51:26  <antimatroidl> it doesn't even see wireless stuff anymore
2012-09-12T09:51:35  <antimatroidl> like when i go into network it doesn't even have a wireless part
2012-09-12T09:51:39  <antimatroidl> before it was even fixed it did :|
2012-09-12T09:51:46  <antimatroidl> maybe it stopped picking the network card up
2012-09-12T09:51:52  <mcstar> no
2012-09-12T09:52:08  <mcstar> you should 'up' the wlan0 again
2012-09-12T09:52:17  <antimatroidl> how? :P
2012-09-12T09:52:29  <mcstar> sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2012-09-12T09:52:50  <mcstar> if it cant do that, then it was necessary to load the b43legacy, as i did before
2012-09-12T09:52:59  <antimatroidl> bah wtf yeah can't do that
2012-09-12T09:53:03  <mcstar> besides having the firmware there

2012-09-12T10:37:43  <antimatroidl> should i uncomment the last line?
2012-09-12T10:37:45  <mcstar> i commented them out
2012-09-12T10:37:53  <mcstar> and forget 94
2012-09-12T10:37:53  <antimatroidl> ah okay
2012-09-12T10:38:56  <antimatroidl> i dunno why my desktop is having so much trouble connecting to the wireless :\
2012-09-12T10:39:08  <antimatroidl> if i disable wireless and re-enable it then it connects for like 15 seconds
2012-09-12T10:39:11  <antimatroidl> will even load google
2012-09-12T10:39:20  <antimatroidl> then just disconnects and tries to connect again indefinitely

2012-09-12T10:42:12  <antimatroidl> it connects consistently upon enabling wireless
2012-09-12T10:42:17  <antimatroidl> just wont stay connected
2012-09-12T10:42:46  <mcstar> not really, but id dont have much wifi experience

2012-09-12T10:43:49  <antimatroidl> ie. when it will connect and how long for
2012-09-12T10:43:50  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you can see the logs why does that happen
