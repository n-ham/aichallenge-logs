2011-10-13T16:07:51  <mleise> Three days after Steve Jobs, Dennis Ritchie died. He was the co-inventor of Unix and the programming language C.
2011-10-13T16:10:18  <McLeopold> really? I just finally bought his book
2011-10-13T16:10:44  <mleise> The C Programming Language ?
2011-10-13T16:10:48  <McLeopold> yep
2011-10-13T16:11:01  <McLeopold> just this weekend
2011-10-13T16:11:03  <mleise> yeah really, I just read it in the D news group
2011-10-13T16:11:28  <mleise> The co-inventor of D named his book "The D Programming Language"
2011-10-13T16:11:49  <mleise> no Linux without that man. shocking!
2011-10-13T16:12:03  <McLeopold> I saw that.  I went to Powell's in Portland, OR.  They have a special nerds only building. :)
2011-10-13T16:12:18  <McLeopold> it's a book store with everything
2011-10-13T16:12:32  <McLeopold> btw, we need some achievements in this contest
2011-10-13T16:12:38  <McLeopold> suggestions?
2011-10-13T16:12:59  <McLeopold> everyone who every held 1st in the rankings gets a gold star
2011-10-13T16:13:30  <amstan> we should get comments for games/players
2011-10-13T16:13:35  <mleise> I'm not very creative at the moment.
2011-10-13T16:14:08  <mleise> comments that link to a location and turn in the visualizer

2011-10-13T16:29:53  <mleise> How comes that noone invented "achievements" before 2008 or when they came up?
2011-10-13T16:30:06  <mleise> Today no game can live without them.
2011-10-13T16:31:10  <mleise> Ok there were bronze, silver and gold medals before, but this creative burst only appeared in the recent time
2011-10-13T16:31:53  <mleise> McLeopold, amstan: are you talking in private chat or why is the channel so quiet?
2011-10-13T16:32:01  <amstan> nope
2011-10-13T16:33:21  <mleise> Well, for my own imaginary programming game I would have 'levels' in the form of different A.I.s that the player has to beat, each becoming stronger in some aspect.
2011-10-13T16:35:43  <mleise> If ants had some water marks in the rankings that are fixed entries (i.e. bots written once by someone), beating them could be an achievement.

2011-10-13T17:18:54  <Abrackadabra> remember me? i've got another question
2011-10-13T17:20:33  <Abrackadabra> how can i get the locations of enemy hills in java?
2011-10-13T17:21:05  <Abrackadabra> in tutorial there is ants.enemy_hills()
2011-10-13T17:22:30  <Abrackadabra> but Ants.java has only getEnemyAnts
2011-10-13T17:27:20  <jnwhiteh> the starter pack likely needs to be updated, check the repository to see if its been updaed?
2011-10-13T17:29:30  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: I can't really say what the java starter looks like.  I wrote the sample bots, but the starter is much different now.
2011-10-13T17:31:49  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: there is a "getEnemyHills"
2011-10-13T17:34:01  <Abrackadabra> there is no getEnemyHills in java starter package

2011-10-13T17:35:16  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: I'll check the download, they may not be updated
2011-10-13T17:35:31  <Abrackadabra> so they are not
2011-10-13T17:37:40  <Dlayne> Hey guys. I've got a problem with visualizer - it doesn't work. I've just synced it from github.
2011-10-13T17:37:51  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: okay, download the starter again
2011-10-13T17:38:13  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: also, did you see the note about a folder named mybot causing all your issues?
2011-10-13T17:38:57  <Abrackadabra> no, i didn't
2011-10-13T17:39:04  <McLeopold> that was part of the issue
2011-10-13T17:39:11  <Abrackadabra> what the problem with mybot?
2011-10-13T17:39:24  <McLeopold> the bot command "java MyBot" was getting mangled because "MyBot" was a valid directory in windows.
2011-10-13T17:39:48  <McLeopold> it was getting changed to "java .\MyBot", which is incorrect
2011-10-13T17:40:05  <Abrackadabra> well, and why "java -cp mybot MyBot" didn't work?
2011-10-13T17:40:17  <McLeopold> so, the 3 solutions where 1) rename the mybot folder 2) use the jar file or 3) use a startup script
2011-10-13T17:40:58  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: the code to extract the bot path isn't compatable with java commands, it's a bug
2011-10-13T17:41:22  <McLeopold> Dlayne: what is the error you get?
2011-10-13T17:44:01  <Dlayne> There is no error. I just can't see replays - white screen. Even if I try manually to open game_logs\replay.0.html. Game finished successfully.
2011-10-13T17:44:16  <McLeopold> what's your browser and os?
2011-10-13T17:45:30  <Dlayne> Win7x64, Opera 11.5. I tried IE also, the same result.

2011-10-13T17:47:22  <Abrackadabra> wow
2011-10-13T17:47:31  <Abrackadabra> renaming mybot really works
2011-10-13T17:47:35  <McLeopold> Dlayne: do you know how to look for javascript errors in a browser?
2011-10-13T17:47:40  <Abrackadabra> so much time wasted >_<
2011-10-13T17:47:52  <Dlayne> need to google that
2011-10-13T17:47:56  <Abrackadabra> thank you McLeopold
2011-10-13T17:48:00  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: np
2011-10-13T17:48:14  <McLeopold> Dlayne: in IE, hit F12
2011-10-13T17:49:27  <Dlayne> source code, script
2011-10-13T17:50:07  <McLeopold> Dlayne: you want to go to the script tab, then watch the console for errors
2011-10-13T17:50:32  <Dlayne> wow, it works on IE, I "allowed block content"
2011-10-13T17:50:43  <McLeopold> cool
2011-10-13T17:51:02  <Dlayne> I'll find solution for Opera, thanx ;)
2011-10-13T17:51:12  <McLeopold> It's complaining because it doesn't trust content from the local file system.
2011-10-13T17:51:21  <McLeopold> The best fix is to just install Google Chrome :)

2011-10-13T17:53:30  <Dlayne> I use opera since 7 version. But it doesnt work with proxy on my job, so I use Chrome at job :(
2011-10-13T18:00:25  <Dlayne> Now replays wors with Opera.
2011-10-13T18:00:31  <Dlayne> *work

2011-10-13T19:54:42  <McLeopold> amstan: In the tutorial, what text editor would you suggest I suggest?
2011-10-13T19:54:50  <McLeopold> amstan: for linux/mac?
2011-10-13T19:55:35  <amstan> McLeopold: gedit should be installed on ubuntu
2011-10-13T19:55:50  <McLeopold> by default? do you know about mac?
2011-10-13T19:56:05  <amstan> nope
2011-10-13T19:57:01  <McLeopold> hmm... I'll just wait on mac stuff
2011-10-13T19:57:18  <McLeopold> so, gedit on the command line works for ubuntu?
