2012-08-29T12:08:16  <antimatroid> "cannot find -lm" or -lc
2012-08-29T12:08:18  <mcstar> antimatroid: ofc not, it is an editor, not a compiler
2012-08-29T12:08:26  <antimatroid> it usually will
2012-08-29T12:08:29  <antimatroid> something broke
2012-08-29T12:08:30  <antimatroid> and i dunno what
2012-08-29T12:08:50  <mcstar> write a makefile
2012-08-29T12:09:00  <antimatroid> i don'
2012-08-29T12:09:03  <antimatroid> t wanna
2012-08-29T12:09:04  <mcstar> or just a compile script
2012-08-29T12:09:11  <mcstar> probably it is a one liner
2012-08-29T12:09:19  <antimatroid> but it should just work
2012-08-29T12:09:28  <antimatroid> i like just pressing f9 in the editor
2012-08-29T12:09:34  <mcstar> whats the whole error message?
2012-08-29T12:09:41  <antimatroid> that's it
2012-08-29T12:10:04  <mcstar> 10.05?
2012-08-29T12:11:07  <antimatroid> i get the same thing if i try to compile from the terminal
2012-08-29T12:11:52  <mcstar> i need more input if you want me to help
2012-08-29T12:11:58  <mcstar> whats the code?
2012-08-29T12:12:14  <antimatroid> any code
2012-08-29T12:12:26  <antimatroid> the most basic cpp file with an empty main
2012-08-29T12:12:40  <antimatroid> it might be time to compile
2012-08-29T12:12:45  <antimatroid> i mean format
2012-08-29T12:12:53  <mcstar> hm?
2012-08-29T12:12:58  <mcstar> time?
2012-08-29T12:12:58  <antimatroid> i'm running an old non-updated version of ubuntu
2012-08-29T12:13:00  <antimatroid> it's long over due
2012-08-29T12:13:04  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-29T12:13:16  <mcstar> you cant compile a simple main from terminal?
2012-08-29T12:13:22  <antimatroid> nope
2012-08-29T12:13:48  <mcstar> "cannot find -lm" or -lc
2012-08-29T12:14:00  <mcstar> whats with the unequal quotation marks?
2012-08-29T12:14:11  <mcstar> cannot find -lm
2012-08-29T12:14:13  <mcstar> or
2012-08-29T12:14:15  <mcstar> cannot find -lc
2012-08-29T12:14:17  <mcstar> ?
2012-08-29T12:14:42  <mcstar> i think you are trying to compile c++ source with c compiler
2012-08-29T12:14:45  <mcstar> antimatroid: ^^
2012-08-29T12:14:49  <mcstar> give me exactly the command
2012-08-29T12:14:54  <mcstar> dont use gcc
2012-08-29T12:14:57  <mcstar> use g++
2012-08-29T12:15:03  <antimatroid> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lm
2012-08-29T12:15:03  <antimatroid> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc
2012-08-29T12:15:03  <antimatroid> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
2012-08-29T12:15:09  <antimatroid> i used g++
2012-08-29T12:15:12  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-29T12:15:20  <mcstar> now show me the code
2012-08-29T12:15:25  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-29T12:16:15  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/HLC7Yv4L
2012-08-29T12:16:37  <antimatroid> command was just g++ file.cpp
2012-08-29T12:16:59  <antimatroid> i really am over due for a format anyway
2012-08-29T12:17:03  <antimatroid> this will be a good excuse
2012-08-29T12:17:17  <antimatroid> but not at 2:16am when i'm shaped at home
2012-08-29T12:17:23  <antimatroid> i'll download the files at uni tomorrow
2012-08-29T12:18:10  <antimatroid> (i don't update stuff cause it uses too much bandwidth, i only have 20gm/m)
2012-08-29T12:18:17  <antimatroid> gb*
2012-08-29T12:18:27  <mcstar> is glibc installed correctly?
2012-08-29T12:18:35  <antimatroid> dunno, it used to work fine :|
2012-08-29T12:18:52  <antimatroid> don't stress :)
2012-08-29T12:20:37  <mcstar> antimatroid: ls -lha /usr/lib/lib[m,c]-2.*.so
2012-08-29T12:20:41  <mcstar> whats the output?
2012-08-29T12:21:06  <antimatroid> no such file or directory
2012-08-29T12:21:17  <mcstar> mayeb it is under /lib
2012-08-29T12:21:20  <mcstar> drop /usr
2012-08-29T12:21:42  <antimatroid> same problem
2012-08-29T12:21:48  <mcstar> o.O
2012-08-29T12:21:54  <mcstar> wtf
2012-08-29T12:21:59  <antimatroid> not worth the effort :)
2012-08-29T12:22:00  <mcstar> you need to have those
2012-08-29T12:22:11  <antimatroid> wouldn't surprise me if it's f'd
2012-08-29T12:22:35  <antimatroid> easy to back up and format
2012-08-29T12:22:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: query with your package manager, where are the contents of glibc
2012-08-29T12:23:13  <mcstar> probably it is called simply glibc under ubuntu, idk
2012-08-29T12:23:42  <mcstar> dpkg -L glibc
2012-08-29T12:24:02  <antimatroid> i dunno how to see where something is from that?
2012-08-29T12:24:12  <mcstar> ^^
2012-08-29T12:24:19  <mcstar> check if that works
2012-08-29T12:24:42  <antimatroid> not installed :|
2012-08-29T12:25:09  <antimatroid> what's the install command? :P
2012-08-29T12:25:12  <antimatroid> maybe that'll fix it
2012-08-29T12:25:31  <mcstar> apt-cache search glibc
2012-08-29T12:25:36  <mcstar> to get the correct package name
2012-08-29T12:25:47  <mcstar> and apt-get install glibc-something to install
2012-08-29T12:26:32  <antimatroid> that gave me so many results :|
2012-08-29T12:26:53  <antimatroid> bear i'm mind i'm half asleep right now
2012-08-29T12:28:47  <mcstar> antimatroid: mayeb it is called libc6 on your distro
2012-08-29T12:29:04  <antimatroid> meh, too much effort
2012-08-29T12:29:14  <antimatroid> i need to be at uni by 10am
2012-08-29T12:30:55  <mcstar> antimatroid: ok, jut reinstall the libc6 package
2012-08-29T12:30:57  <mcstar> for me
2012-08-29T12:31:35  <mcstar> libc6-udeb
2012-08-29T12:31:39  <mcstar> final name
2012-08-29T12:31:48  <mcstar> i think thats correct, this ubuntu thing is weird
2012-08-29T12:32:00  <antimatroid> how do i do that?
2012-08-29T12:32:11  <mcstar> sudo apt-get install libc6-udeb
2012-08-29T12:32:40  <antimatroid> done and still doesn't compile
2012-08-29T12:32:52  <antimatroid> wait
2012-08-29T12:32:56  <antimatroid> said unable to locate package
2012-08-29T12:33:09  <mcstar> subtle difference
2012-08-29T12:33:37  <mcstar> whats your version of ubuntu?
2012-08-29T12:33:41  <mcstar> im browsing the hardy repos
2012-08-29T12:33:42  <antimatroid> 10.10
2012-08-29T12:33:43  <antimatroid> old
2012-08-29T12:33:58  <smiley1983> In my debian virtualbox, libc6 installs libm and libc in /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ (logically)
2012-08-29T12:34:04  <smiley1983> ubuntu may be the same
2012-08-29T12:34:13  <smiley1983> Hi, by the way

2012-08-29T12:35:30  <smiley1983> mcstar: hey! Did your Arches get messed up by the recent glibc upgrade?
2012-08-29T12:35:32  <antimatroid> confused

2012-08-29T12:35:55  <antimatroid> smiley1983: how's the mainland?
2012-08-29T12:35:56  <mcstar> and glibc update?
2012-08-29T12:36:26  <smiley1983> Maybe not so recent, a few months ago they moved glibc stuff from /lib to /usr/lib and it caused file conflicts
2012-08-29T12:36:39  <smiley1983> antimatroid: becoming warm again, the cockroaches are reappearing
2012-08-29T12:36:50  <smiley1983> How's Tasmania?
2012-08-29T12:36:54  <antimatroid> yes, getting better weather wise here
2012-08-29T12:36:59  <antimatroid> i am so sick of winter
2012-08-29T12:37:05  <mcstar> smiley1983: oh, thats not a glibc update, its making /lib a simlink to /usr/lib
2012-08-29T12:37:14  <mcstar> smiley1983: i had to manually delete files
2012-08-29T12:37:24  <antimatroid> been skating a lot recently too which the weather hasn't been helpful for
2012-08-29T12:38:26  <smiley1983> mcstar: yes, I had to do a bit of manual deleting in /lib - it almost made me install Debian testing on one machine
2012-08-29T12:38:58  <mcstar> smiley1983: oh really? i just had to delete 1 dir
2012-08-29T12:39:19  <mcstar> basically, if there was someting in /lib it had to go, before the update
2012-08-29T12:40:30  <mcstar> smiley1983: how is your ocaml these days?
2012-08-29T12:40:47  <smiley1983> mcstar: my desktop was straightforward, I just had to get rid of /lib/modules - but on the laptop, I had a few things from AUR which had installed in /lib, and a few other packages as well, so there was a lot more fiddling around
2012-08-29T12:41:23  <smiley1983> antimatroid: I have been very lazy, I have to start being active again now it's getting warmer
2012-08-29T12:41:44  <antimatroid> i'm a bit the same
2012-08-29T12:41:51  <antimatroid> have been driving when the rain is out
2012-08-29T12:41:57  <antimatroid> hockey ends soon too
2012-08-29T12:41:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: btw, i saw your Diagram.h header, bad sign, very bad sign...
2012-08-29T12:42:06  <antimatroid> why?
2012-08-29T12:42:16  <mcstar> you know why
2012-08-29T12:42:26  <antimatroid> no?
2012-08-29T12:42:52  <antimatroid> capital D?
2012-08-29T12:42:56  <mcstar> i dont think anything that has to do with diagrams fits well with c++, except c++ uml class diagrams
2012-08-29T12:42:57  <antimatroid> i haven't programmed in ages
2012-08-29T12:43:10  <antimatroid> oh the name?
2012-08-29T12:43:15  <antimatroid> yeah i can fix that after
2012-08-29T12:43:16  <mcstar> the purpose
2012-08-29T12:43:34  <mcstar> are you trying to do something mathy in c++?
2012-08-29T12:43:42  <mcstar> thats my objection
2012-08-29T12:46:28  <mcstar> http://www.folklore.org/projects/Macintosh/images/polaroids/polaroids.3.jpg
2012-08-29T12:46:31  <antimatroid> yes, yes i am
2012-08-29T12:46:39  <antimatroid> it's easy to do though
2012-08-29T12:46:40  <mcstar> im wondering how they'd make that central picture
2012-08-29T12:47:06  <antimatroid> magic
2012-08-29T12:47:24  <mcstar> no really
2012-08-29T12:47:32  <antimatroid> an illusion
2012-08-29T12:47:52  <mcstar> hm?
2012-08-29T12:48:07  <mcstar> it is a computer generated graphics
2012-08-29T12:48:13  <mcstar> what is an illusion about it?
2012-08-29T12:48:23  <antimatroid> i was making a joke about magicians
2012-08-29T12:48:24  <antimatroid> nm
2012-08-29T12:48:30  <mcstar> im just wondering if theres a simple way of achieving that same kind of overlap
2012-08-29T12:48:33  <antimatroid> i wonder if that tesselates nicely?
2012-08-29T12:48:53  <antimatroid> probably not
2012-08-29T12:48:57  <mcstar> its a hexagon
2012-08-29T12:49:05  <antimatroid> you're a square
2012-08-29T12:49:09  <mcstar> every hexagon tesselates nicely
2012-08-29T12:49:21  <antimatroid> i meant with the visuals
2012-08-29T12:49:22  <mcstar> oddly enough, a tessaract is a cube
2012-08-29T12:49:45  <mcstar> it would look good
2012-08-29T12:49:51  <mcstar> i will draw it
2012-08-29T12:49:58  <mcstar> but im not sure how yet
2012-08-29T12:50:06  <mcstar> i mean, there is a complicated way
2012-08-29T12:50:11  <mcstar> but i want it simply
2012-08-29T12:50:32  <smiley1983> mcstar: haven't done much programming recently, but started thinking about running some kind of Tron server. That would give me an excuse to write a Tron AI in ocaml.
2012-08-29T12:50:48  <antimatroid> siley1983: i like that idea
2012-08-29T12:50:59  <mcstar> stuck on the tron train
2012-08-29T12:51:04  <antimatroid> although i'm reasonably busy till the end of semester
2012-08-29T12:51:22  <mcstar> im making original research atm
2012-08-29T12:51:26  <mcstar> feels good
2012-08-29T12:51:41  <mcstar> i have to write it down
2012-08-29T12:51:43  <mcstar> and i hate that
2012-08-29T12:51:50  <antimatroid> yeah writing shit up sucks
2012-08-29T12:52:10  <antimatroid> have to come up with explainable notation etc.
2012-08-29T13:06:06  <smiley1983> Does anyone know if the current (zeta branch) aichallenge code can be tested locally without access to Amazon Web Services? When I tried a while ago I couldn't find a way, but there may be some simple configuration that I'm missing.
2012-08-29T13:09:16  <smiley1983> ls
2012-08-29T13:11:11  <mcstar> . ..
2012-08-29T13:13:38  <mcstar> smiley1983: im not sure whats the interface between amazon and zeta, but whatever it is, it is written in python i think, and you could check it out, and see what needs to be done
2012-08-29T13:15:49  <smiley1983> I'm just looking at it again now. Looks like it should be moved into a virtual machine so I can give it some permissions. My memory, though, is that I got up to a point where I needed to supply my AWS login details to go further - there was no purely local testing option that I could find
2012-08-29T13:18:11  <mcstar> i think you are talking about the web code?
2012-08-29T13:18:34  <mcstar> anyway, what i was suggesting, is to dig into the source
2012-08-29T13:18:44  <mcstar> i dont think it is docmented elsewhere
