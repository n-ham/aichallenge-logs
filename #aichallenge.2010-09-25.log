2010-09-25T00:00:10  <sb8244> all of my games are ending like that
2010-09-25T00:00:47  <Janzert> I think the tcp program will normally tell you why a game ends early
2010-09-25T00:01:25  <Janzert> actually http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=sb8244 shows it as being a loss by illegal move
2010-09-25T00:01:56  <sb8244> is that like sending things to a null planet?
2010-09-25T00:02:25  <Janzert> or sending more ships than a planet has, etc. yeah
2010-09-25T00:02:38  <Janzert> sending from a planet you don't own
2010-09-25T00:02:45  <sb8244> which is weird, i don't konw why its doing that
2010-09-25T00:02:48  <sb8244> that NEVER happens against bots
2010-09-25T00:03:49  <sb8244> i'm confused as to why that's happening, it shouldnt be
2010-09-25T00:04:08  <Janzert> time to log the games and start debugging :/

That would be soooo bitchin. I have seen some simple online IDEs before, and I gotta say it's pretty cool. We could build something unprecedented!
2010-09-25T00:05:32  <Cyndre> lmao
2010-09-25T00:05:38  <Cyndre> every time you do that I swing back in
2010-09-25T00:05:53  <AlliedEnvy> Ahaha, sorry.
2010-09-25T00:06:06  <Cyndre> oh dont worry abuot, just find it funny
2010-09-25T00:06:13  <Janzert> heh, I've just been doing it in pm's to contestbot
2010-09-25T00:08:42  <sb8244> i found the error and i think it's in the visualizer / tcp game code
2010-09-25T00:08:52  <sb8244> because it doesn't happen on the contest visualizer
2010-09-25T00:09:00  <sb8244> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=149690
2010-09-25T00:09:13  <sb8244> Right before i get my planet taken, i have ships from that planet out
2010-09-25T00:09:23  <sb8244> then i crash when the planet is taken, with ships still on the field
2010-09-25T00:09:38  <sb8244> the ships should'nt be affected by the defeated planet though
2010-09-25T00:10:16  <Naktibalda> visualizer can't affect result of your game
2010-09-25T00:10:33  <sb8244> well i mean the game code then
2010-09-25T00:10:38  <sb8244> that DOESNT happen in contest situation
2010-09-25T00:11:55  <Naktibalda> are you running identical version of your bot?
2010-09-25T00:12:13  <AlliedEnvy> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=sb8244
2010-09-25T00:12:30  <AlliedEnvy> Every one of the games was lost due to invalid orders
2010-09-25T00:13:11  <Naktibalda> tcp server ignored invalid orders before
2010-09-25T00:13:22  <Naktibalda> does official server ignore them?
2010-09-25T00:13:32  <sb8244> idk?  I never crash due to invalid orders
2010-09-25T00:13:37  <sb8244> i dont even know WHAT invalid order s i have
2010-09-25T00:13:55  <Naktibalda> log your orders :)
2010-09-25T00:14:03  <Janzert> that's why you really need to log the game and see what's actually happening
2010-09-25T00:14:17  <AlliedEnvy> sending less than one ship? sending from a planet you don't own? from/to the same planet? To a nonexistent planet?
2010-09-25T00:14:40  <sb8244> Also what's the best way to log in java
2010-09-25T00:14:42  <sb8244> write to a file?
2010-09-25T00:15:07  <sb8244> is that even legal?  I know system.out.println() will crash with an invalid order
2010-09-25T00:15:14  <sb8244> as you can see from my round 0 loss
2010-09-25T00:15:27  <AlliedEnvy> Yup. Just make sure you remove the file printing code before submitting officially
2010-09-25T00:16:04  <Janzert> I think even writing to stderr with tcp server
2010-09-25T00:16:13  <AlliedEnvy> Man. StringTokenizer is so much faster than Scanner.
2010-09-25T00:16:58  <AlliedEnvy> If you wish to create a Planet Wars bot from scratch, you must first invent the universe. ;)
2010-09-25T00:17:00  <sb8244> will the tcp server only take my IssueOrder commands?
2010-09-25T00:17:05  <sb8244> it won't try to run my file code
2010-09-25T00:17:19  <AlliedEnvy> correct, sb8244
2010-09-25T00:17:20  <Janzert> hmm just thought of it, does the tee command flush often enough to be useful here?

2010-09-25T02:55:43  <a1k0n> yeah, the ships/growth counts tend to do that

2010-09-25T02:59:32  <sigh> hmmm... I don't have that problem, but if it is the text wrapping maybe Ctrl- to make the font size smaller?
2010-09-25T03:00:59  <rwa> didn't seem to work
2010-09-25T03:02:50  <sigh> the hardcore solution is to use greasemonkey (or equivalent for your browser) to change the visualiser :D
2010-09-25T03:03:00  <sigh> or make a bookmarklet
2010-09-25T03:06:48  <dhartmei> hmm, the official engine doesn't write async to the bots, right? what if its write buffer is too small for an entire input (many fleets...), and the first bot sets its read buffer to 1, read up to the 'g' in 'go', then blocks the engine doing calculations for 10 seconds? :>

2010-09-25T03:11:22  <dhartmei> at least the code doesn't deal with incomplete writes, re-writing remainders, etc.

2010-09-25T07:37:00  <antimatroid> but it improved my score :|
2010-09-25T07:37:31  <sigh> antimatroid: I can see games in your profile

2010-09-25T07:39:01  <antimatroid> ie. Beanhome beat me, that's gone
2010-09-25T07:39:08  <sigh> something screwing is going on
2010-09-25T07:39:09  <antimatroid> i thought he resubmitted and bumped my score, but he hadn't
2010-09-25T07:39:13  <sigh> *screwy
2010-09-25T07:41:04  <danielvf> sigh: yes

2010-09-25T07:41:32  <danielvf> sigh: spent from midnight to 6 overloaded
2010-09-25T07:41:51  <sigh> ah, ok
2010-09-25T07:41:55  <danielvf> sigh: This probably caused most games to end in unreal timeouts
2010-09-25T07:41:55  <sigh> so those games are lost?
2010-09-25T07:42:21  <danielvf> sigh: I tossed those couple hours of games
2010-09-25T07:42:35  <sigh> ah, i see
2010-09-25T07:42:49  <antimatroid> that would make sense
2010-09-25T07:42:53  <sigh> thanks for the heads-up
2010-09-25T07:42:54  <antimatroid> sigh: did you see the afl tie before? :P
2010-09-25T07:43:07  <sigh> antimatroid: not really into footy :P
2010-09-25T07:43:24  <antimatroid> neither, but hadn't seen some friends in a while so thought i had better go and say hello
2010-09-25T07:43:40  <antimatroid> i have an epic beard going atm, i get referred to as jesus
2010-09-25T07:43:43  <sigh> fair enough
2010-09-25T07:44:33  <antimatroid> it's now taking like 3-4 minutes just to see if my changes do anything on a game against a default bot :|
2010-09-25T07:44:44  <sigh> why?
2010-09-25T07:44:48  <antimatroid> still not sure if i'm going to be able to get this approach below 1 second a move
2010-09-25T07:44:55  <antimatroid> cause it's taking AGES to decide on some moves

2010-09-25T08:18:58  <sigh> hmmm... still no games
2010-09-25T08:19:30  <sigh> maybe because I'm have no rank, and I'm not a new submission the tournament engine is ignoring me
2010-09-25T08:19:39  <sigh> I'll try uploading my bot again
2010-09-25T08:19:48  <BtbN> Is there a better player than the java one? My bot seems to do an invalid move, but i can't get what's wrong with it
2010-09-25T08:22:07  <sigh> BtbN: try looking in log.txt first, it logs all the commands that the engine sees... so you can check if one is invalid
2010-09-25T08:22:31  <BtbN> there is only one that can be invalid, but i don't find out why it is invalid
2010-09-25T08:22:56  <antimatroid> sigh: definitely reupload if you haven't yet
2010-09-25T08:23:08  <antimatroid> i wish i could stop a game mid way through and see what's happened
2010-09-25T08:23:18  <antimatroid> it's at turn 93 and i expect it'll probably go to 200
2010-09-25T08:23:23  <antimatroid> been going for a good 10 minutes aha
2010-09-25T08:23:33  <sigh> why can't you stop it?
2010-09-25T08:24:08  <antimatroid> cause then it'd close the viewer too?
2010-09-25T08:24:17  <antimatroid> and i want to see what's happened
2010-09-25T08:24:31  <antimatroid> it's onto move 95
2010-09-25T08:24:31  <FlagCapper> Woah
2010-09-25T08:24:41  <sigh> kill the engine processs specifically?

2010-09-25T08:25:09  <FlagCapper> This won't last long
2010-09-25T08:25:12  <antimatroid> my 11th seems like more of a lie
2010-09-25T08:25:26  <antimatroid> especially after it had a loss to someone before that got removed
2010-09-25T08:25:40  <sigh> alright, new submission got a game!
2010-09-25T08:26:05  <antimatroid> now i have to wait for however long the time limit ended up being :|
2010-09-25T08:26:07  <antimatroid> heeh
2010-09-25T08:26:07  <sigh> against someone ranked 400 as well, so I don't have to start from 1200 like last time -__

2010-09-25T08:28:23  <youwillfail> bit like futurama recently
2010-09-25T08:28:27  <youwillfail> <3 that episode
2010-09-25T08:28:32  <sigh> yup :)
2010-09-25T08:28:55  <sigh> that proof was pretty interesting
2010-09-25T08:29:05  <youwillfail> yeah, i didn't really look at it
2010-09-25T08:29:15  <youwillfail> did a unit on group theory last semester though, that was cool
2010-09-25T08:29:20  <sigh> not too hard to follow
2010-09-25T08:29:56  <youwillfail> i keep seeing groups all over the place these days, it's like ahuh i can thrust with that
2010-09-25T08:30:20  <sigh> I only have a basic understanding of group theory
2010-09-25T08:30:46  <sigh> enough to follow thing when people talk about it, but not enough to know when to use it
2010-09-25T08:30:51  <youwillfail> my topics teacher set an assignment the other week to basically show the symmetric difference operation on the set of allowable sets is a group
2010-09-25T08:31:42  <youwillfail> we had an algebra assignment to show an operation defined on the fano plane forms a group, then we managed to extend that out and find group tables for fano planes up to like 8 dimensions
2010-09-25T08:31:43  <sigh> what class is that for?
2010-09-25T08:31:49  <youwillfail> topics in adv. maths
2010-09-25T08:32:04  <youwillfail> the group table for the 2d case is so amazingly symmetric
2010-09-25T08:32:14  * sigh doesn't know what a fano plane is
2010-09-25T08:32:16  <youwillfail> not even in just the normal symmetric ways
2010-09-25T08:32:27  <youwillfail> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane
2010-09-25T08:32:53  <youwillfail> that, basically opeation is on the points, and for any two, you get the third unique point on a line segment with the other two
2010-09-25T08:33:26  <youwillfail> turns out you can extend that up dimensions and keep it still working, we managed to work out the geometry of the 3d one, but haven't been able to make a model of it yet, tried with paper but got too messy
2010-09-25T08:33:36  <sigh> i see
2010-09-25T08:34:18  <sigh> i wish i had done more maths

2010-09-25T11:13:26  <sigh> bartwe: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=155971 :P
2010-09-25T11:25:40  <nullkuhl> wow quick death :)
2010-09-25T11:28:22  <sigh> nullkuhl: I've killed bartwe in 7 moves before :)
2010-09-25T11:29:56  <Naktibalda> I have never seen enemy planet so close :)
2010-09-25T11:30:48  <sigh> yeah, those maps are hard to play
2010-09-25T11:30:57  <Naktibalda> I don't see a way to expand in this map
2010-09-25T11:31:05  <sigh> my bot got owned on the main server because of a close map
2010-09-25T11:31:22  <Naktibalda> distance 2, no planets with num_ships <10
2010-09-25T11:32:58  <sigh> yeah, doesn't look like there is anything to do
2010-09-25T11:33:08  <sigh> looks like stalemate
2010-09-25T11:34:00  <Naktibalda> well, if one player sends 10 ships out, another can send up to 20 and capture a planet
2010-09-25T11:34:16  <Naktibalda> but probably a draw is the best result
2010-09-25T11:34:51  <Janzert> first mover loses
2010-09-25T11:35:16  <sigh> Janzert: not if the first mover just attacks the opponent :P
2010-09-25T11:35:43  <jesionaj> you'll send out 100 and he'll have 110 by the time the fleet gets there
2010-09-25T11:36:04  <sigh> it's just another way to maintain the stalemate
2010-09-25T11:36:12  <Janzert> sigh: you're right still a draw in that case
2010-09-25T11:36:45  <jesionaj> looks like best strategy is to wait, but things could change once you get enough ships on your home planet to expand
2010-09-25T11:37:11  <sigh> jesionaj: no matter how many ships you have, your opponent will have the same amount
2010-09-25T11:37:15  <sigh> assuming you both wait
2010-09-25T11:37:35  <jesionaj> right
2010-09-25T11:39:29  <jesionaj> but at some point, you might be able to expand to enough other planets that losing your homeworld is acceptable
2010-09-25T11:40:04  <Janzert> I don't think you can hold any long enough to make back the ships you'll spend conquering it
2010-09-25T11:40:13  <jesionaj> yeah, that's the problem
2010-09-25T11:40:22  <sigh> jesionaj: maybe, but your opponent can reach any planet you conquer in <= 2 moves
2010-09-25T11:40:40  <jesionaj> true, and then they can capture it easily
2010-09-25T11:40:41  <sigh> chances are they will be able to take it for cheaper
2010-09-25T11:41:01  <jesionaj> looks like it is a stalemate
2010-09-25T11:41:39  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-25T11:42:19  <jesionaj> unless your opponent doesn't account for it, then it's a win :)
2010-09-25T11:42:37  <sigh> hehe
2010-09-25T11:43:22  <dwchandler> that's true for all maps
2010-09-25T11:44:07  <dwchandler> every game is a stalemate, if both bots are perfect
2010-09-25T11:44:33  <sigh> I don't think game has perfect play
2010-09-25T11:44:42  <sigh> *this game
2010-09-25T11:44:56  <sigh> only on some maps
2010-09-25T11:48:25  <Janzert> yeah, I think there are at least some rock-paper-scissors type situations
2010-09-25T11:48:40  <Janzert> not sure how common they are though
2010-09-25T11:49:21  <sigh> me neither, but I'm leaning on the side of quite common

2010-09-25T13:02:14  <boiserm> maybe the other bot timed out?

2010-09-25T13:02:41  <boegel> someone introduced a bug in an update of the server, I'd say... :)
2010-09-25T13:02:50  <boegel> can I report this somewhere 'official'?
2010-09-25T13:02:52  <boiserm> boegel: on the bright side, you won ;-)

2010-09-25T13:07:11  <customKoncept> at least the game started

2010-09-25T13:09:10  <customKoncept> I look at the top few bots & just think WTF
2010-09-25T13:09:22  <customKoncept> but even though I still have lots of bugs
2010-09-25T13:09:31  <customKoncept> (logic, not code)
2010-09-25T13:09:36  <customKoncept> a few things really help
2010-09-25T13:09:50  <customKoncept> do you have some decent reinforcement code?
2010-09-25T13:09:51  <boiserm> yeah, I realized I was trying to just code up a bot every evening and upload it to see how it did... no surprise that I'm not very high in the rankings... I need to stop and think a bit.
2010-09-25T13:10:11  <customKoncept> It takes about 1/2 day to a day to float
2010-09-25T13:10:15  <boiserm> The next version I'm going to upload does reinforcement much better
2010-09-25T13:10:23  <customKoncept> :)
2010-09-25T13:10:26  <boiserm> :-P

2010-09-25T13:11:16  <customKoncept> boiserm - are you a student?
2010-09-25T13:11:27  <boiserm> I tentatively uploaded an "improved" version, but I think I left in an experimental parameter, and it ended up 2x as bad as the previous version
2010-09-25T13:11:37  <boiserm> customKoncept: not currently
2010-09-25T13:11:55  <Naktibalda> Graph Algorithms, Pathfinding in AI and Network flow algorithms may be useful for this contest
2010-09-25T13:12:25  <customKoncept> just wondering... I'd like the time of being a student again
2010-09-25T13:12:38  <boiserm> customKoncept: *me too*
2010-09-25T13:12:50  <boegel> this is just too funny to be true: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4742099 :)
2010-09-25T13:12:52  <customKoncept> gah - how do you whisper?
2010-09-25T13:13:07  <boegel> actually, I'm surprised either instance of my bot wins, they should draw afaik
2010-09-25T13:13:17  <customKoncept> yeah
2010-09-25T13:13:19  <customKoncept> hmm...
2010-09-25T13:13:29  <customKoncept> I've found small differences between players
2010-09-25T13:13:45  <customKoncept> in that OCCASIONALLY 1 player get a different turns to planet rounding
2010-09-25T13:14:01  <customKoncept> and... I start my turn with a Collections.shuffle() on my planets
2010-09-25T13:14:17  <customKoncept> but not on enemy / neutral planets
2010-09-25T13:14:19  <jmcarthur> boegel: your bot is deterministic and still somehow beat itself?
2010-09-25T13:14:24  <customKoncept> yeah
2010-09-25T13:14:31  <jmcarthur> might be a sign that there's a bug :)
2010-09-25T13:14:34  <boiserm> customKoncept: what advantage does that get you?
2010-09-25T13:14:35  <customKoncept> list/array traversal starts at 0
2010-09-25T13:14:40  <customKoncept> no advantage
2010-09-25T13:14:51  <customKoncept> its a carry over from a slower bot
2010-09-25T13:14:54  <boiserm> well, I mean... then why do it?
2010-09-25T13:14:58  <boiserm> oh
2010-09-25T13:15:18  <customKoncept> evaluating planets usually involves distance calculations
2010-09-25T13:15:18  * boiserm understand

2010-09-25T13:32:22  <Cyndre> watching right now
2010-09-25T13:33:07  <Cyndre> no, just an over reinforcement (my bot had more growth then)
2010-09-25T13:33:53  <Cyndre> once my bot was ahead in growth it just waits
2010-09-25T13:34:04  <Cyndre> which under a strict 200 turn limit is a bad thing

2010-09-25T13:49:31  <boegel> jmcarthur: I think I know what happened... I sort things based on some double value, and the Haskell runtime probably isn't deterministic in that
2010-09-25T13:49:48  <boegel> jmcarthur: comparing doubles never is a good idea is "equal" values matter
2010-09-25T13:50:10  <boegel> jmcarthur: I think two things with the same double value are ordered differently in both instances
2010-09-25T13:50:17  <boegel> jmcarthur: which explain the different behavior
2010-09-25T13:50:22  <jmcarthur> boegel: it should at least be deterministic...
2010-09-25T13:50:26  <boegel> it all makes sense \o/
2010-09-25T13:50:38  <jmcarthur> it would be really weird for haskell especially...
2010-09-25T13:50:42  <boegel> jmcarthur: well, no, not necessarily, not with double values
2010-09-25T13:50:49  <jmcarthur> since pure functions are supposed to be referentially transparent
2010-09-25T13:50:59  <boegel> jmcarthur: it really depends on how they are represented in memory, rounding errors and whatnot
2010-09-25T13:51:05  <jmcarthur> no, i can see things like commutativity failing, but not referential transparency
2010-09-25T13:51:26  <boegel> jmcarthur: well, it's the best thing I can think of
2010-09-25T13:51:36  <boegel> anyway, afk for a while
2010-09-25T13:51:57  <boegel> I'll post a new topic on the forum about bots playing against themselves, this should be solved ASAP imho
2010-09-25T13:52:02  <jmcarthur> i think you can break RT if you are compiling with -fexcess-precision, but the server doesn't do that anyway

2010-09-25T15:18:14  <anoek> Are there any plans to capture why a game was terminated early, ie timeout, invalid move, etc?
2010-09-25T15:19:11  <anoek> I've been playing hundreds of games on through the tcp server and locally, and I never run into any problems.. the two games i have on the live server prematurely terminate with my loss for some unknown reason..
2010-09-25T15:19:52  <boiserm> anoek: what language are you using?
2010-09-25T15:20:11  <boiserm> anoek: is it possible that there's some reliance on a certain version?
2010-09-25T15:21:06  <anoek> boiserm: precompiled c++ module through javascript
2010-09-25T15:21:26  <anoek> so there shouldn't be any reliance on versions, since it's the same binary i test over here
2010-09-25T15:21:41  <Naktibalda> what's that?
2010-09-25T15:22:00  <Naktibalda> contest server doesn't accept compiled code
2010-09-25T15:22:14  <anoek> it's a javascript module

2010-09-25T15:34:09  <anoek> hmm.. i do spew out a ton of stuff to stderr, would that cause any problems maybe?
2010-09-25T15:35:46  <anoek> i shouldn't be timing out or anything like that, i make decisions in ~50 ms or so .. max
2010-09-25T15:36:07  <Zannick> my guess is invalid order
2010-09-25T15:36:22  <Zannick> or not saying "go"
2010-09-25T15:36:55  <anoek> Hm, i would have thought i would have seen that playing any of the hundreds of tcp based games, or any of the mini tournaments i do locally benching bots against eachother..
2010-09-25T15:36:56  <Zannick> stderr output shouldn't be an issue, the engine ignores that
2010-09-25T15:37:08  <Zannick> or at least it should ignore it
2010-09-25T15:37:14  <Zannick> actually
2010-09-25T15:37:32  <Zannick> the engine doesn't read stderr; it doesn't go anywhere
2010-09-25T15:37:41  <Zannick> if you're outputting a lot, you might be filling the pipe
2010-09-25T15:37:59  <anoek> Doh
2010-09-25T15:38:04  <Zannick> and then a write to stderr is waiting for the buffer to clear
2010-09-25T15:38:07  <anoek> Yeah that'd explain it
2010-09-25T15:38:44  <anoek> testing that theory now..

2010-09-25T17:00:51  <danielvf> It's likely not your fault.
2010-09-25T17:01:54  <boegel> I'd guess so too
2010-09-25T17:01:58  <boegel> just want to make sure
2010-09-25T17:02:21  <boegel> and check whether this is a server problem similar to the boegel vs boegel stuff I was seeing earlier :)
2010-09-25T17:02:32  <danielvf> After we take care of more games, I'm going to be checking into the timeout issues.
2010-09-25T17:02:35  <boegel> just want to help out, no critisism
2010-09-25T17:02:41  <danielvf> boegel: yeah, np
2010-09-25T17:05:29  * boegel resubmits to get rid of the time-outs
2010-09-25T17:05:39  <boegel> I really want to figure out how high this bot can go :)
2010-09-25T17:05:53  <boegel> I have a feeling I'm close to top 100 :)
2010-09-25T17:06:01  <danielvf> :D
2010-09-25T17:06:30  <danielvf> You haskellers are doing well
2010-09-25T17:06:45  * boegel bows
2010-09-25T17:06:56  <boegel> Haskell is superb for doing stuff like this
2010-09-25T17:07:10  <boegel> efficiency isn't too much of an issue (with my tactics at least)
2010-09-25T17:07:26  <boegel> you're constantly working with fairly small lists of things (planets, fleets, ...)
2010-09-25T17:07:47  <boegel> it's really easy to make a slight change to your code to adjust your strategy, ...
2010-09-25T17:07:51  <boegel> I'm loving it
2010-09-25T17:08:01  <danielvf> *nods*
2010-09-25T17:08:08  <boegel> I wanted to get back to Haskell with something fun, and I've definitely found it
2010-09-25T17:08:22  <boiserm> a buddy of mine is learning Haskell and trying to convince me it's the best thing since sliced bread
2010-09-25T17:08:42  <boiserm> I've started reading a few tutorials, and I'll admit it's pretty cool
2010-09-25T17:08:52  <danielvf> Heh
2010-09-25T17:09:13  <boiserm> but I don't know it well enough to do a bot (yet) and haven't had the right project idea to motivate me to learn it
2010-09-25T17:09:20  <boiserm> who knows, got a couple of months left
2010-09-25T17:09:48  <boegel> does this count as a strategy, split up fleets as much as possible to get the other bot to time-out? :D http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4731923
2010-09-25T17:10:22  <boiserm> boegel: lol
2010-09-25T17:10:33  <Naktibalda> this question should be in FAQ :)
2010-09-25T17:10:34  <boegel> boiserm: there's a great starters package for Haskell
2010-09-25T17:10:46  <boegel> boiserm: check it out, you'll get started in no time
2010-09-25T17:10:52  <boegel> boiserm: also, check out learnyouahaskell.com
2010-09-25T17:11:09  <boegel> boiserm: best tutorial *ever* (and not just Haskell)
2010-09-25T17:11:16  <Naktibalda> boegel: it won't help you to get into top 100
2010-09-25T17:11:27  <boegel> Naktibalda: I'm not considering it
2010-09-25T17:11:45  <boegel> Naktibalda: just wondering if this is allowed
2010-09-25T17:11:55  <Naktibalda> it is
2010-09-25T17:11:55  <boegel> Naktibalda: I can imagine my bot would currently trip over it
2010-09-25T17:12:13  <boegel> Naktibalda: but that's easily remedied by merging fleets prior to analysis

2010-09-25T17:29:58  <lotek93> boegel: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4750592
2010-09-25T17:30:44  <boegel> lotek93: two main possibilities
2010-09-25T17:31:15  <boegel> lotek93: either your bot produced an invalid order (e.g. send more ships in total from planet P than it has)
2010-09-25T17:31:36  <boegel> lotek93: or it failed to produce all orders within 1 second, i.e. a time-out
2010-09-25T17:31:56  <boegel> lotek93: noticing the large number of fleets in play, I'd say the last option, i.e. a time-out
2010-09-25T17:32:22  <lotek93> boegel: and there is no error diagnostic from engine?
2010-09-25T17:32:56  <boegel> lotek93: not yet, it's being worked on
2010-09-25T17:33:10  <boegel> lotek93: there is a trick though, if you have debugging in your bot locally
2010-09-25T17:33:55  <lotek93> boegel: locally i haven't any problem
2010-09-25T17:34:37  <boegel> lotek93: there's a way in which you can replay a game played on the server, to help figure out what might have gone wrong
2010-09-25T17:34:45  <boegel> lotek93: see http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=628&start=0
2010-09-25T17:35:13  <boegel> lotek93: if your bot sent an invalid order, you should be able to see it with the replay
2010-09-25T17:35:32  <boegel> lotek93: read the entire topic, the last script is a lot easier to use
2010-09-25T17:36:06  <lotek93> thanks boegel!
2010-09-25T17:39:22  <lotek93> its very strange anyway..
2010-09-25T17:39:58  <boegel> lotek93: it *may* be due to a busy server too, they have seen problems like this in the past
2010-09-25T17:40:16  <boegel> lotek93: but I'd really check if you handle lots of fleets efficiently
2010-09-25T17:42:18  <lotek93> boegel: btw how they can guarantee exactly 1 second for make orders?
2010-09-25T17:43:06  <lotek93> boegel: all my planets send only half of ships, not more

2010-09-25T17:47:17  <boegel> lotek93: your bot is only giving 1 second by the server to create its orders and give a 'go' to actually execute them
2010-09-25T17:47:33  <boegel> lotek93: if it takes longer, the server consideres it a time-out, and you lose
2010-09-25T17:47:51  <boegel> lotek93: so, either you very sure you're way below that 1s limit, or you check yourself in your bot
2010-09-25T17:48:20  <boegel> lotek93: I'd guess your code processing all the fleets that are in play is too slow, leading to a time-out

2010-09-25T17:51:59  <lotek93> boegel: yes, i know, i mean - if there is many games simultaneously how can i be sure that server performance is enough for my bot?
2010-09-25T17:52:21  <boegel> lotek93: well, I guess that's one of the problems they're having now
2010-09-25T17:52:38  <boegel> lotek93: I'm guessing they only run one bot at a time or something?
2010-09-25T17:52:53  <boegel> that's not very efficient though :)
2010-09-25T17:53:04  <boegel> danielvf: how do you guys handle this stuff?

2010-09-25T17:56:57  <Itkovian> boegel: they can run a bot per core. There's 200 turn max, so 203s max per game. I expect they have a lot of machines, no?

2010-09-25T17:57:33  <boegel> Itkovian: 400s per game, there's two sides
2010-09-25T17:57:41  <Itkovian> no, 1 core per player
2010-09-25T17:57:44  <boegel> Itkovian: also, what about shared caches?
2010-09-25T17:57:49  <Itkovian> true also
2010-09-25T17:57:51  <boegel> Itkovian: ah, right
2010-09-25T17:58:05  <lotek93> 1 core per pair mb?
2010-09-25T17:58:16  <boegel> Itkovian: shared caches might have a *big* influence on time, especially on a time-scale of < 1s
2010-09-25T17:58:22  <Itkovian> I think caches are no issue, unless you give the thing a lot of code, and you are allowed to upload 2MB zips?
2010-09-25T17:58:34  <Itkovian> so yeah, in the end it might be a problem
2010-09-25T17:58:39  <Itkovian> makes me wonder
2010-09-25T17:58:54  <Itkovian> would you allowed to spawn threads to offload computation?
2010-09-25T17:59:15  <boegel> Itkovian: what about the data this thing produces :)
2010-09-25T17:59:30  <Itkovian> what do they keep?
2010-09-25T17:59:35  <boegel> Itkovian: no, only single-threaded stuff imho
2010-09-25T17:59:41  <boegel> Itkovian: depends on the bot, I guess :)
2010-09-25T17:59:42  <Itkovian> they need not keep state, just order afaik
2010-09-25T17:59:57  <boegel> Itkovian: some bots keep state across turns
2010-09-25T18:00:22  <Itkovian> true, but I was referring to the logs/data
2010-09-25T18:00:33  <Itkovian> or did you mean the data per bot in-game?
2010-09-25T18:02:29  <boegel> Itkovian: of course
2010-09-25T18:05:38  <boiserm> ...was comparing fleet owners to planet IDs instead of to planet owners -_-
2010-09-25T18:05:52  <boiserm> ...fixed the bug, and the bot did *worse.*  Make of that what you will.
2010-09-25T18:06:12  <Itkovian> change it back then
2010-09-25T18:07:48  <boiserm> tests are still running... did worse against DualBot, but much better against RageBot
2010-09-25T18:07:57  <boiserm> eh, whatever.  I was amused

2010-09-25T20:03:27  <Zaphus> yeah, it will
2010-09-25T20:03:56  <sigh> adumlah's strategy is really effective
2010-09-25T20:04:04  <sigh> I'll have to figure out a way to steal it
2010-09-25T20:04:07  <Zaphus> I'm just making up excuses for why my bot that was in the top 10 a few days ago has now dropped to 44th :-)

2010-09-25T20:05:28  <Zaphus> adumlah's looks easy to emulate at a glance, might be worth building one to play against - I cant imagine its always strong

2010-09-25T20:07:05  <Zaphus> yeah, actually looking at more of his games it isnt as obvious
2010-09-25T20:09:48  <Zaphus> wow - his two most recent losses were illegal/timeouts as well, not an actual loss

2010-09-25T20:11:42  <sigh> it uses the same strategy though
2010-09-25T20:14:17  <Zaphus> I wish they could have archived the top 10 bots from each week so we could see the change in strategies as the weeks progress, it's been interesting to see it get refined
2010-09-25T20:15:06  <sigh> that won't be as useful until new submission don't put you back down to ~1000
2010-09-25T20:16:13  <Zaphus> yeah, that annoys me :-)  these arent new bots, they are incremental changes
2010-09-25T20:20:58  <Zaphus> it's not so bad if you get a game every hour, but when it's 4 hours between games it can take 2-3 days to get back up to the top 50
2010-09-25T20:25:28  <a1k0n> haha bartwe is in #minecraft too
2010-09-25T20:28:34  <sigh> bartwe said last night that he wasn't working on his bot because of minecraft
2010-09-25T20:28:49  <a1k0n> i figured that might be why he fell behind.  same here
2010-09-25T20:28:55  <sigh> haha
2010-09-25T20:29:12  <a1k0n> but i did do some work last night.   made an exhaustive alpha-beta search on limited instances of the game.
2010-09-25T20:29:27  <a1k0n> turns out, knowing the move your opponent made before you make yours gives you a huuuuuge advantage
2010-09-25T20:29:30  <sigh> did that pan out well?
2010-09-25T20:29:53  <a1k0n> well no, basically for the 'minimax incorrect' reasons from the tron contest
2010-09-25T20:29:57  <youwillfail> a1k0n: well der :P
2010-09-25T20:30:27  <sigh> "'minimax incorrect' reasons from the tron contest"?
2010-09-25T20:30:33  <youwillfail> i tried a very naive implementation at picking coordinated moves rather than individual ones, but way too slow, so going to need to chop that down a lot
2010-09-25T20:30:41  <a1k0n> minimax basically assumes you're taking turns making moves
2010-09-25T20:30:41  <sigh> I thouoght you guys used minimax in the tron contest?
2010-09-25T20:30:43  <youwillfail> but i'm gonna need to stop working on it and do some uni work today
2010-09-25T20:30:47  <sigh> a1k0n: yes, I know
2010-09-25T20:30:52  <a1k0n> yeah.
2010-09-25T20:31:04  <a1k0n> but in tron, it didn't matter so much, so there was a whole thread on the forum about how minimax shouldn't work but it does
2010-09-25T20:31:18  <a1k0n> because the instances of tron maps in which there were mutually exlusive outcomes were rare
2010-09-25T20:31:46  <sigh> in tron did you assume that you knew your opponent's move, or that he knew his?
2010-09-25T20:31:56  <a1k0n> that your opponent knew yours
2010-09-25T20:32:09  <a1k0n> so moves were slightly pessimized
2010-09-25T20:32:18  <sigh> yup, figured... just checking
2010-09-25T20:32:29  <sigh> I've never applied minimax to simultaneous games
2010-09-25T20:32:29  <youwillfail> i just built the tree as thought it was sequential move, with them as player 2, asusming they would best counter our moves, then said what's the best minimum we can ensure, and picked that
2010-09-25T20:32:31  <a1k0n> here, if you pessimize your moves, you just don't expand fast enough
2010-09-25T20:32:43  <a1k0n> youwillfail: like a two-step lookahead?
2010-09-25T20:32:48  <sigh> a1k0n: I agree
2010-09-25T20:32:55  <a1k0n> i implemented something along those lines, also coordinating attacks, also way too slow
2010-09-25T20:33:01  <a1k0n> and even when i ignored the timeout, it was completely ineffective
2010-09-25T20:33:15  <youwillfail> a1k0n: it would generate for as long as it could, then afert each turn, throw out the part of the tree that wasn't followed, and continue calculating

2010-09-25T20:33:36  <sigh> I skimmed through my AI book for techniques for dealing with games with simultaneous books, but didn't find anything :(
2010-09-25T20:33:39  <a1k0n> youwillfail: does it work?
2010-09-25T20:33:56  <Zaphus> sigh:  maybe we need to write a book after this :-)
2010-09-25T20:33:58  <a1k0n> yeah i was hoping to find some axioms of the system or something with this minimax on limited instances
2010-09-25T20:33:58  <youwillfail> it would also pick like a "draw with space left" over a "certain draw" to see if we can fill space better etc.
2010-09-25T20:34:02  <sigh> Zaphus: hshs
2010-09-25T20:34:04  <sigh> *haha
2010-09-25T20:34:16  <a1k0n> youwillfail: oh you mean for tron, right
2010-09-25T20:34:26  <youwillfail> yeah that was for tron
2010-09-25T20:34:33  <a1k0n> thought you meant for planetwars
2010-09-25T20:34:38  <youwillfail> if you want game theory books, look at myersons or fudenbergs
2010-09-25T20:34:54  <a1k0n> i'm wondering whether there's any value in modelling this as a POMDP
2010-09-25T20:34:54  <youwillfail> nah, way too hard to search
2010-09-25T20:35:05  <youwillfail> although even looking one or two moves ahead with that might work?
2010-09-25T20:35:12  <youwillfail> if you could get a payoff function working well
2010-09-25T20:35:27  <a1k0n> yeah.  well i tried it with two moves, and it sucks
2010-09-25T20:35:37  <a1k0n> but my implementation may be buggy as hell and probably is
2010-09-25T20:35:49  <a1k0n> actually searchin gall possible moves is really hard
2010-09-25T20:36:22  <youwillfail> yep, i tried a different approach (sorry, we're keeping that secret) which tries to look across all possible moves and pick the best
2010-09-25T20:36:26  <sigh> hell enumerating all possible moves is quite expensive :P
2010-09-25T20:36:32  <youwillfail> was taking over like 30 seconds to make some moves when i only owned 2 planets
2010-09-25T20:36:34  <a1k0n> indeed
2010-09-25T20:36:51  <a1k0n> i would imagine for each src-dest pair you could solve a linear program though
2010-09-25T20:37:10  <youwillfail> yeah, have considered that, but becomes messy when you have fleets of over this or 0
2010-09-25T20:37:12  <Zaphus> all possible moves for the first turn would be huge,   22 destination planets, 1-100 ships each :-)
2010-09-25T20:37:14  <youwillfail> so you need either or constraint binding
2010-09-25T20:37:16  <sigh> yeah, have to make some approximations even then... as it's not really linear
2010-09-25T20:37:24  <a1k0n> yeah, so it becomes integer programming, which is messy
2010-09-25T20:37:54  <a1k0n> Zaphus: all possible moves once you've captured a few planets is just insane
2010-09-25T20:38:45  <youwillfail> yep, basically number of possible moves to a single planet is the product of the number of ships at each planet you own (plus 1 to each)
2010-09-25T20:38:47  <sigh> haha, even on this first move you are enumerating all integer partitions of 100 :P
2010-09-25T20:38:53  <sigh> *the first
2010-09-25T20:38:55  <a1k0n> yep
2010-09-25T20:38:57  <youwillfail> although i think you could certianly reduce that with a bit of dark magic
2010-09-25T20:39:19  * sigh reaches for his eye o newt
2010-09-25T20:39:47  <a1k0n> i'm really curious how your bot works, sigh, as i'm basically out of ideas. :)
2010-09-25T20:39:54  <Zaphus> I'd be interested to see if anyone does any predicting of the oppositions move, whether they ever get it correct !
2010-09-25T20:40:13  <youwillfail> Zaphus: i'm pretty sure it's going to be needed after a certain point
2010-09-25T20:40:17  <youwillfail> once people get it working well
2010-09-25T20:40:26  <youwillfail> i've seen people doing it already
2010-09-25T20:40:28  <sigh> a1k0n: score each destination on the best way to attack it, then attack the destinations with the best scores
2010-09-25T20:40:35  <sigh> that's basically it
2010-09-25T20:40:44  <a1k0n> oh.  well that's bascially all i'm doing.  that's reassuring.
2010-09-25T20:40:46  <a1k0n> no lookahead?
2010-09-25T20:40:51  <a1k0n> that is, no game tree searches
2010-09-25T20:40:55  <sigh> none
2010-09-25T20:41:05  <sigh> my bots run in less than 1ms
2010-09-25T20:41:10  <sigh> per move
2010-09-25T20:41:16  <youwillfail> i figure game trees will be useful, but not unless you iron out all the heuristic stuff first
2010-09-25T20:41:23  <a1k0n> ok, then i'm going to explore reinforcement learning if i can come up with a value function representation
2010-09-25T20:41:36  <Zaphus> sigh: impressive
2010-09-25T20:41:48  <Zaphus> sigh: Imagine what you could do with a few more ms :-)
2010-09-25T20:42:00  <a1k0n> i still wish i knew why a1k0n-0.2 is better than a1k0n-0.4.1, when the latter wipes the floor with the former
2010-09-25T20:42:28  <youwillfail> because you build it to improve against your own strategy, but then it wasn't necessarily as strong?
2010-09-25T20:42:32  <youwillfail> my current bot is like that
2010-09-25T20:42:34  <sigh> Zaphus: extra ms might help my bot but it makes my testing cycles much longer
2010-09-25T20:42:43  <youwillfail> although it seems to have slipped to a more reasonable position overnight
2010-09-25T20:42:48  <sigh> so it might be detrimental in the short term
2010-09-25T20:43:01  <a1k0n> youwillfail: well, both bots work fundamentally the same way, -0.4.1 is just more accurate in its calculations
2010-09-25T20:43:09  <a1k0n> apparently 0.2's approximations cover more of reality
2010-09-25T20:43:19  <youwillfail> is it not as aggressive though?
2010-09-25T20:43:26  <a1k0n> it's more aggressive actually
2010-09-25T20:43:32  <a1k0n> it's just more naïve about defense
2010-09-25T20:43:40  <youwillfail> i made mine smarter with moves, but it lost the aggressiveness that won it some games, but stopped losing so many games to lower ranked players
2010-09-25T20:43:58  <youwillfail> i've taken defense on as pretty much the more important part
2010-09-25T20:44:05  <migi_> a1k0n, is your 0.2 doing the same as me and ignoring opponent's captures when it comes to defense?
2010-09-25T20:44:22  <youwillfail> i find my bot often gets stuck trying to take an enemies planet when they can easily back it up
2010-09-25T20:44:25  <sigh> ignoring opponent captures?
2010-09-25T20:44:26  <a1k0n> migi_: it's counting incoming ships from both parties for each planet
2010-09-25T20:44:33  <youwillfail> then it gets carried away while the other bot expands then goes in front and claims the win
2010-09-25T20:44:36  <a1k0n> so it will try to defend if there is an attack
2010-09-25T20:44:39  <migi_> yes that's what I'm doing too, a1kon
2010-09-25T20:44:46  <sigh> youwillfail: yes me too
2010-09-25T20:44:53  <sigh> youwillfail: I've got plans to mitigate that
2010-09-25T20:44:57  <youwillfail> yep
2010-09-25T20:45:06  <migi_> but I'm ignoring the possibility of the opponent first capturing another planet, then attacking with those ships
2010-09-25T20:45:24  <migi_> and I'm considering if I should make those calculations or if they won't be worth it
2010-09-25T20:45:45  <youwillfail> i have trouble trying to do that
2010-09-25T20:46:06  <youwillfail> because then other parts using closest enemy used that
2010-09-25T20:46:07  <a1k0n> hm, i could acount for that but you'd have to maintain a 2*universe diameter horizon on all future lookahead
2010-09-25T20:46:37  <youwillfail> a1k0n: i've found generating such data is pretty much free with time
2010-09-25T20:46:48  <a1k0n> yeah it's pretty low-complexity
2010-09-25T20:47:34  <sigh> I *want* to do things based on my predictions of what the opponent will do
2010-09-25T20:47:41  <sigh> but I don't know *how*
2010-09-25T20:47:47  <youwillfail> it would be cool to have an ai comp with hundreds/thousands of planets and like 0.1 seconds for each move
2010-09-25T20:49:13  <migi_> sigh, neural networks are pretty good at predicting stuff
2010-09-25T20:49:33  <migi_> though I'm not sure they can be used here
2010-09-25T20:49:36  * a1k0n scoffs
2010-09-25T20:49:56  <youwillfail> i have tried to find information on neural networks but it's all handwavy crap
2010-09-25T20:49:57  * sigh looks for his eye of newt again
2010-09-25T20:50:07  <youwillfail> is there somewhere I can actually find the maths defining everything?
2010-09-25T20:50:28  <jesionaj`> got any ai textbooks?
2010-09-25T20:50:35  <youwillfail> nope :P
2010-09-25T20:50:39  <a1k0n> to predict stuff, you write down tentative equations of the probability that such-and-such happens given so-and-so, and then turn it around with bayes' theorem and measure so-and-so to figure out such-and-such
2010-09-25T20:51:01  <youwillfail> we're intending to do something very much like that anyway
2010-09-25T20:51:09  <youwillfail> i should really look into neural networks more
2010-09-25T20:51:15  <youwillfail> but haven't even really started on that yet
2010-09-25T20:51:18  <migi_> but to predict non-trivial bots with that, you'd have to write a million such equations I think
2010-09-25T20:51:44  <a1k0n> not really.  you just need to be clever about your representation.
2010-09-25T20:51:58  <youwillfail> another possible strategy idea i had for this was the possibility of trying to set up a numerical algorithm for approximating a nash equilibria, then playing what that gets to in time
2010-09-25T20:52:08  <youwillfail> but i'm not sure that'd work very well
2010-09-25T20:52:13  <a1k0n> just saying 'neural network' doesn't solve anything: what are your inputs and what are you outputs?  what is it really saying if the neural network outputs X?
2010-09-25T20:52:33  <a1k0n> if you have those inputs and outputs you might just be able to write down something more straightforward.
2010-09-25T20:52:50  <youwillfail> no, but one would ideally like to have a probability distribution over moves the enemy might make ;)
2010-09-25T20:53:06  <sigh> youwillfail: hah, good luck with that
2010-09-25T20:53:25  <a1k0n> indeed.  but if it's parameterized by a funciton that looks at each planet, and the nearest enemy/friendly planets to that, it might be easily possible
2010-09-25T20:53:44  <a1k0n> even a *really bad* approximation can get you somewhere
2010-09-25T20:54:24  <sigh> a1k0n: I think that kind of what I was looking at doing
2010-09-25T20:54:32  <a1k0n> like, have your bot be tunable by like three parameters, and then watch your opponents' moves and tune those three parameters to them
2010-09-25T20:54:43  <a1k0n> it might be complete crap, but it might work
2010-09-25T20:54:49  <sigh> "this bot seems partly defensive with a chance of rage"
2010-09-25T20:55:01  <youwillfail> you could always try a tit for tat approach, but i think that'd be pretty crappy
2010-09-25T20:55:06  <a1k0n> someone made a copybot
2010-09-25T20:55:09  <a1k0n> it was pretty funny, and always lost
2010-09-25T20:55:11  <sigh> Zannick:
2010-09-25T20:55:20  <Zannick> yes?
2010-09-25T20:55:20  <sigh> Zannick made the copybot
2010-09-25T20:55:21  <youwillfail> i want to see an optimal response bot
2010-09-25T20:55:30  <youwillfail> so always assumes it has second mover advantage
2010-09-25T20:55:31  <a1k0n> that's why i wrote the alpha-beta search
2010-09-25T20:55:32  <youwillfail> and see how that goes
2010-09-25T20:55:38  <sigh> sorry, Zannick was just responding to a1k0n
2010-09-25T20:55:53  <Zannick> it pretty much only won if the other player tried to take central planet and it was any good
2010-09-25T20:56:00  <youwillfail> has anyone tried to turn it into a game of nim?
2010-09-25T20:56:06  <sigh> man, me puncutation no; is good

2010-09-25T21:00:14  <youwillfail> a1k0n: it's not even a basic integer programming problem :(
2010-09-25T21:00:29  <sigh> its a complex integer problem!
2010-09-25T21:00:37  <youwillfail> but i don't think you really need to reduce it to integer programming
2010-09-25T21:00:37  <a1k0n> what, optimizing moves to a cost function?
2010-09-25T21:00:50  <youwillfail> provided you can meet the linear constraints, can't you just take the integer floors?
2010-09-25T21:01:13  <youwillfail> a1k0n: assuming you either want to take a planet or leave it along, fleets to planet j are either above say x or 0
2010-09-25T21:01:19  <a1k0n> that generally gets you a starting point in integer programming, from what i understand
2010-09-25T21:01:20  <youwillfail> so you need either or constraint to bind
2010-09-25T21:01:44  <sigh> yeah, in integer programming you use linear programming for bounds
2010-09-25T21:01:45  <youwillfail> not either or, one of (strictly)
2010-09-25T21:01:45  <a1k0n> oh.  yeah.  it's an integer programming problem, given you want to take planets x, y, and z
2010-09-25T21:01:57  <a1k0n> figuring out your givens there is the hard part
2010-09-25T21:03:01  <youwillfail> i think i know a way to use simplex, just not sure if it'd be fast enough either
2010-09-25T21:03:12  <youwillfail> how fast do you think phase I would run on these maps?
2010-09-25T21:03:16  <a1k0n> i'm just doing a greedy "planet 0 has 50 extra ships, send those first"
2010-09-25T21:03:31  <sigh> a1k0n: same :D
2010-09-25T21:03:35  <youwillfail> a1k0n: i've decided i shouldn't take a planet unless i can back up my claim :P
2010-09-25T21:03:44  <sigh> youwillfail: same :D
2010-09-25T21:04:18  <youwillfail> basically track to the middle (not if it's extremely sub optimal), then if they expanded to fast, ruin them, otherwise fight over most planets
2010-09-25T21:04:39  <youwillfail> that's my current thoughts on a heuristic in a box
2010-09-25T21:04:39  <sigh> although me bots idea of "back up a claim" doesn't assume that my opponent will attempt to defend the planet
2010-09-25T21:04:47  <a1k0n> i've never implemented simplex myself, so i have no idea how long it would take to run or even what equations you're thinking of using

2010-09-25T21:43:52  <MarcAndrePC> kind of strange
2010-09-25T21:44:07  <youwillfail> neither really
2010-09-25T21:44:20  <youwillfail> just play around with different ideas for picking moves, implement them and see how they work out
2010-09-25T21:44:33  <youwillfail> i would suggest doing as everyone else did and doing strictly heuristic based stuff to get a feel first
2010-09-25T21:44:45  <youwillfail> wikipedia is helpful as always <3
2010-09-25T21:45:27  <MarcAndrePC> ya min/max tree...
2010-09-25T21:45:37  <youwillfail> search space is way too large
2010-09-25T21:45:40  <MarcAndrePC> I thought of using it but didn't see the point so far
2010-09-25T21:45:50  <youwillfail> you either need to work out a way to reduce that or use other methods
2010-09-25T21:46:22  <MarcAndrePC> you can reduce it by making "intelligent move'' like : to take a neutral he will send at least that much...
2010-09-25T21:46:55  <youwillfail> yeah
2010-09-25T21:47:04  <MarcAndrePC> the only work I did so far is a defensive function
2010-09-25T21:47:16  <youwillfail> but even then the problem of working out feasible "pseudo optimal" moves isn't so trivial in this instance
2010-09-25T21:47:18  <youwillfail> at least imo
2010-09-25T21:47:39  <sigh> even if you knew that you needed x ships to take over a neutral planet, you still have a huge combinatorial search for the best planets to send those ships from
2010-09-25T21:48:04  <MarcAndrePC> usually the closest
2010-09-25T21:48:05  <youwillfail> it gets messier and messier the more heuristic stuff you try to throw in
2010-09-25T21:48:10  <sigh> and pruning those moves are much less obvious
2010-09-25T21:48:26  <sigh> MarcAndrePC: yeah, but you might want to use those units for something else
2010-09-25T21:49:30  <MarcAndrePC> well you separate the unit needed to defend the planet from the unit that are free (that's how I work)
2010-09-25T21:50:03  <sigh> MarcAndrePC: that's what I'm doing at the moment, but I'm finding that's overly restrictive
2010-09-25T21:50:13  <MarcAndrePC> needed to defend based on incoming ships
2010-09-25T21:50:40  <MarcAndrePC> Is there really an alternative to that? if you need 10 to defend leave at least 10...
2010-09-25T21:50:55  <sigh> there is, you can decide to flee
2010-09-25T21:50:55  <youwillfail> if your fleet will make it in time to save, it isn't necessarily optimal to send from the closest planets
2010-09-25T21:51:08  <youwillfail> as those ships might be better used elsewhere, that's what makes it so difficult ;)
2010-09-25T21:51:50  <MarcAndrePC> better use somewhere : defend against another attack, take a new neutral or attack enemy planet
2010-09-25T21:51:54  <sigh> MarcAndrePC: also, just defending based on incoming units is not enough... play ragebot and you will see :)
2010-09-25T21:51:56  <youwillfail> for example, it would be better to send planets from a ship further away from the enemy to save incoming fleets from the enemy rather than leave new ships grown at that planet
2010-09-25T21:52:00  <jesionaj`> sigh: if you have a good weighting function, 0-1 knapsack makes the combinatorial search easy
2010-09-25T21:52:27  <youwillfail> i'm going to go out on a limb and say i think dp is out
2010-09-25T21:52:38  <youwillfail> unless you work some really good dark magic in there
2010-09-25T21:53:03  <MarcAndrePC> I have a function that move useless ship in the back to the "front" whatever the front might be... be the front is like where the things are happening
2010-09-25T21:53:08  <youwillfail> once you get more than a couple of planets, it's ridiculous
2010-09-25T21:53:39  <youwillfail> sigh: cough cough :P
2010-09-25T21:53:58  <sigh> jesionaj`: that's like saying that if I had a good enough evaluation function I would just need to search one move deep :P

2010-09-25T21:57:27  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3525), EBraun(3427), adumlah(3403), kcm1700(3378), bix0r4ever(3369), felixcoto(3350), davidjliu(3322), McLeopold(3299), wagstaff(3284), Loks1982(3275)
2010-09-25T21:57:29  <MarcAndrePC> when I have only 1 planet, I don't send more fleet that I need to defend if the oponent send all his fleet to attack me
2010-09-25T21:57:41  <sigh> does it wait, attack opponent, or capture 20-ship neutral?
2010-09-25T21:58:14  <sigh> MarcAndrePC: ah yup, I do that too, but I generalised it to more planets
2010-09-25T21:58:21  <MarcAndrePC> never tried this one, I don't have a script for testing all map, but I will try it now
2010-09-25T21:59:19  <sigh> from what you said, you should be fine on that map
2010-09-25T21:59:36  <youwillfail> hmmm.. would the starter packages ALWAYS draw with themselves?
2010-09-25T21:59:43  <youwillfail> that might be a way of eliminating starter package bots
2010-09-25T21:59:55  <MarcAndrePC> I take 20 neutral, win in 34 turn
2010-09-25T22:00:11  <MarcAndrePC> nah they dont draw
2010-09-25T22:00:24  <MarcAndrePC> they attack the same planet so they are really stupid, one always win
2010-09-25T22:00:46  <youwillfail> is it possible to construct a map on which they always draw and wouldn't normally?
2010-09-25T22:00:58  <MarcAndrePC> yup
2010-09-25T22:01:00  <youwillfail> so they pick symmetric moves but not trivially nothing
2010-09-25T22:01:06  <MarcAndrePC> make weakest the center one
2010-09-25T22:01:11  <MarcAndrePC> they will always draw
2010-09-25T22:01:28  <youwillfail> because there are a LOT of starter package bots on the main server, ideally it would be nice to disable them from playing as many games as all the other bots
2010-09-25T22:01:29  <MarcAndrePC> they will always send ship at the same time to the same planet and the same amount and never take any planets
2010-09-25T22:01:59  <MarcAndrePC> they dont pick symmetric move, they attack the same planet
2010-09-25T22:02:20  <MarcAndrePC> planet have an ID, 1 , 2 ,3 4, they run down the list, pick the first weakest and attack it
2010-09-25T22:03:00  <MarcAndrePC> if the weakest is at the same distance from both side they will never be able to take it, and continue attacking it with equivalent attack
2010-09-25T22:03:25  <sigh> ragebot will always draw against itself though
2010-09-25T22:03:38  <MarcAndrePC> really?
2010-09-25T22:03:44  <sigh> why not?
2010-09-25T22:03:52  <youwillfail> yeah okay, i think that'd be a reasonable way to remove starter bots, get 2 or 3 maps like that, run the lower ranked bots against a starter package bot on them, if it's all draws, no more games for them?
2010-09-25T22:03:55  <sigh> it just sends all ships to weakest opponent
2010-09-25T22:04:05  <MarcAndrePC> didn't ever check how rage bot work
2010-09-25T22:04:27  <youwillfail> do you guys think that'd work?
2010-09-25T22:04:37  <youwillfail> you don't want to disable any legitimate accounts
2010-09-25T22:04:39  <youwillfail> ANY
2010-09-25T22:05:13  <MarcAndrePC> if they dont take any planet for all the game, it's 2 starter probably...
2010-09-25T22:05:50  <MarcAndrePC> but if you can just judge on draw, win or lose to determine that's a problem
2010-09-25T22:05:51  <youwillfail> the maps would also want to have obvious better moves for any other bots
2010-09-25T22:07:05  <Janzert> in the tron contest they just did a file comparison to the starter packages
2010-09-25T22:07:48  <MarcAndrePC> is there any way to test your bot against other player without using tcp server, I can't seems to make them work
2010-09-25T22:08:02  <MarcAndrePC> my bot always timed out for no reason...
2010-09-25T22:10:12  <scottj> Help me understand why a linear regression based on the data in the game replays of the top bots using a model like Y (some representation of moves source/destination/quantity) = X (map state + binary won/lost) B is a bad idea? map state would be a series of matrices representing the map chopped up into cells and representing growth rates, {enemy, my, neutral} forces, reinforcement arrivals at time t+1...n*, and then a binary whether the player one or lo
2010-09-25T22:11:15  <MarcAndrePC> in english?
2010-09-25T22:11:28  <scottj> o espanol
2010-09-25T22:13:00  <MarcAndrePC> nah your strat just seems impossible to understand
2010-09-25T22:13:46  <youwillfail> yeah say what? what are you trying to understand?
2010-09-25T22:14:05  <youwillfail> try it out and see if it's a bad idea
2010-09-25T22:14:24  <youwillfail> you aren't  necessarily going to know which map you're playing on in the final tournament though, nor are you guaranteed those will be the only maps
2010-09-25T22:15:40  <davidjliu> hey everyone, I was just wondering if there is any way to debug games previously played online
2010-09-25T22:16:13  <youwillfail> on tcp? you run locally, so set up your own debugging
2010-09-25T22:16:24  <davidjliu> I mean from the actual online contest
2010-09-25T22:16:30  <youwillfail> if you want to debug on the main server, it's going to have to be in the form of sending signals
2010-09-25T22:16:40  <youwillfail> like something fucked up, send 1 ship
2010-09-25T22:16:44  <sigh> davidjliu: http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=628
2010-09-25T22:17:01  <davidjliu> k, thanks
2010-09-25T22:17:04  <sigh> that will let you parse the playback string, and feed the state into your bot locally
2010-09-25T22:17:33  <davidjliu> cool

2010-09-25T22:24:54  <MarcAndrePC> anyone is using parasite attack : wait for enemy to attack a neutral then send some ship to take it after?
2010-09-25T22:25:04  <MarcAndrePC> does it do a big difference in game?
2010-09-25T22:25:58  <bss03-AFK> MarcAndrePC: I don't have specific code for it, but my bot does enjoy sending fleets to arrive the turn after it's opponents.
2010-09-25T22:26:07  <sigh> mine too
2010-09-25T22:26:07  *** bss03-AFK is now known as bss03
2010-09-25T22:26:50  <sigh> my code is not specific either
2010-09-25T22:26:54  <bss03> Somtimes that hurts me though, 'cause my bot is still a bit stupid.
2010-09-25T22:27:00  <MarcAndrePC> my bot resend ship to retake it currently so I wonder of the utility

2010-09-25T22:27:32  <bss03> It depends on the distance the neutral is from your respective planets.
2010-09-25T22:27:43  <sigh> yup
2010-09-25T22:27:57  <bss03> If it's a neutral that is closer to you, waiting for you opp to send ships is good, because you'll be able to retake and hold at a discount.
2010-09-25T22:28:00  <youwillfail> i will do that to a nearest neutral if they are stupid enough
2010-09-25T22:28:12  <sigh> and if it is possible to take a planet, but let your opponent cover the initial cost, that good in general
2010-09-25T22:28:19  <youwillfail> but you don't want to wait and them expand and grow
2010-09-25T22:28:26  <bss03> It the other way, you might get it for 1-2 turns, but they'll be able to retake and hold and you'll have lost ships for nothing.
2010-09-25T22:28:30  <youwillfail> but you also don't want to expand so fast that they can ruin you
2010-09-25T22:28:53  <youwillfail> it's such an awesome game
2010-09-25T22:28:55  * bss03 Is "DaTwinkDady" on the official server and TCP server.
2010-09-25T22:28:58  <boiserm> so I'm considering playing around with making a Haskell bot :-P  Does anyone have a favorite unofficial starter pack?
2010-09-25T22:29:10  <pgpaskar_> thats an..... interesting name
2010-09-25T22:29:24  <bss03> boiserm: I sorta use the one from jaspervdj.
2010-09-25T22:29:46  <boiserm> bss03 sorta as in with custom modifications?
2010-09-25T22:29:58  <bss03> boiserm: MY github project might also be a good place to start; my bot is under LGPL.
2010-09-25T22:30:36  <MarcAndrePC> I would like the first ranked bot to be open source :)
2010-09-25T22:30:43  <sigh> :)
2010-09-25T22:30:49  <youwillfail> MarcAndrePC: most people relesae their code at the end
2010-09-25T22:30:49  <bss03> boiserm: Yeah.  I didn't change his main IO loop, or the GameState/Planet/Fleet/Order data structures, but I added a simulation engine of my own and dropped whatever he had.

2010-09-25T22:31:48  <youwillfail> he is
2010-09-25T22:31:55  <davidjliu> heh, we're literally tied right now
2010-09-25T22:31:57  <davidjliu> in the rankings
2010-09-25T22:32:02  <bss03> Last I checked I was still in the Top 100.  I have 3-4 modifications to make tonight, too.
2010-09-25T22:32:07  <davidjliu> oops, not anymore
2010-09-25T22:32:09  <youwillfail> nope :P
2010-09-25T22:32:11  <davidjliu> I lost, I guess
2010-09-25T22:32:35  <sigh> :)
2010-09-25T22:33:46  <youwillfail> i love being able to use the arrow keys on canvas visualiser
2010-09-25T22:34:34  <youwillfail> is there a way to use that on ones own computer yet?

2010-09-25T22:36:45  <youwillfail> do i need to download python?
2010-09-25T22:37:07  <sigh> you will need to have python installed, yes
2010-09-25T22:37:51  <youwillfail> okay, downloading
2010-09-25T22:37:53  <youwillfail> cheers
2010-09-25T22:38:02  <sigh> the python code is very simple, if you have some aversion to python and want to port to a different language :P
2010-09-25T22:38:22  <youwillfail> i have no aversion, haskell and python are on the to learn list

2010-09-25T22:50:32  <sigh> haha, move 54 looks so funny... with blue attacking the 43-ship neutral
2010-09-25T22:51:17  <Cyndre> lmao
2010-09-25T22:51:54  <youwillfail> only slightly over the top aa
2010-09-25T22:53:53  <sigh> Cyndre: you have a bug on move 26? attacking the 20 ship neutral?
2010-09-25T22:54:01  <Cyndre> same game?
2010-09-25T22:54:05  <sigh> yup
2010-09-25T22:54:53  <Cyndre> hmmm
2010-09-25T22:55:12  <Cyndre> it looks like its next planet choice didnt count the incomming fleet (or didnt get the time right)
2010-09-25T22:55:34  <sigh> looks like a timing issue
2010-09-25T22:56:12  <MarcAndrePC> light blue didn't have any defensive function
2010-09-25T22:56:33  <MarcAndrePC> easy win
2010-09-25T22:56:36  <sigh> yeah well, Cyndre is picking on people ranked ~1100
2010-09-25T22:56:57  <Cyndre> 5 games already - much nicer
2010-09-25T22:57:15  <Cyndre> I do have a bug though

2010-09-25T22:59:12  <MarcAndrePC> dam it why I cant play on tcp :(
2010-09-25T22:59:43  <Cyndre> Im just using the windows one someone made in here (sorry I cant remember his name right now)
2010-09-25T22:59:47  <sigh> MarcAndrePC: what happens?
2010-09-25T23:00:10  <MarcAndrePC> always got an error : bot timed out
2010-09-25T23:00:19  <sigh> :(
2010-09-25T23:00:20  <MarcAndrePC> do you need a different code to play on tcp?
2010-09-25T23:00:43  <sigh> no, should it should just work
2010-09-25T23:01:04  <MarcAndrePC> work locally, work on main...
2010-09-25T23:01:42  <sigh> so it connects to the tcp server, starts a game and times out on the first move?
2010-09-25T23:01:52  <Zannick> if your bot isn't an executable you need to make a script to invoke it
2010-09-25T23:02:13  <Zannick> eg ./MyBot.sh instead of trying to pass "java MyBot" into tcp as one argument
2010-09-25T23:02:37  <MarcAndrePC> exactly
2010-09-25T23:03:05  <MarcAndrePC> oh really? I use jave and was passing java MyBot...
2010-09-25T23:03:32  <Zannick> that's probably it
2010-09-25T23:03:37  <MarcAndrePC> do you have the code for the script?
2010-09-25T23:04:42  <Zannick> put "#!/bin/sh" as the first line and "java MyBot" as the second
2010-09-25T23:04:52  <Zannick> then chmod +x the script file
2010-09-25T23:07:00  <MarcAndrePC> will it work on windows?
2010-09-25T23:07:26  <Zannick> oh, windows
2010-09-25T23:07:31  <MarcAndrePC> that's linux right
2010-09-25T23:07:36  <Zannick> yeah
2010-09-25T23:07:52  <Olathe> MarcAndrePC: Try http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3836#p3836
2010-09-25T23:08:05  <Olathe> MarcAndrePC: It'll tell you if it can't run your bot.

2010-09-25T23:09:29  <youwillfail> hmmm this damn visualiser wont load :)
2010-09-25T23:09:29  <bss03> Ouch.  8-8Bot is a lot better than 8-7Bot.

2010-09-25T23:10:38  <MarcAndrePC> will check the -d debug mode option to see...
2010-09-25T23:10:47  <youwillfail> i run the bat file and it just closes, perhaps i should try from command line and see what it says
2010-09-25T23:10:59  <Olathe> MarcAndrePC: Ahh, OK :)
2010-09-25T23:12:01  <Olathe> MarcAndrePC: Yeah, debug will give you timestamps, so you can see if the server actually gives your bot any time before it says you lose.
2010-09-25T23:12:13  <youwillfail> claims python isn't a recognized internal or external command
2010-09-25T23:12:24  <youwillfail> i added the python folder to the environment variables
2010-09-25T23:12:41  <sigh> youwillfail: well, for now just give the full to the python exe

2010-09-25T23:14:54  <sigh> can't ping the new server

2010-09-25T23:15:02  <youwillfail> hmm okay
2010-09-25T23:15:42  <sigh> it's afraid of ping :)
2010-09-25T23:15:46  <Olathe> MarcAndrePC: What are the timestamps on those (you can paste at codepad.org)?
2010-09-25T23:16:05  <MarcAndrePC> I dont get any other message in my console
2010-09-25T23:16:32  <youwillfail> how long does your bot usually take to decide on its move?
2010-09-25T23:16:37  <MarcAndrePC> are the timestamp send to a file?
2010-09-25T23:16:41  <youwillfail> my usual bot is usualyl under 0.1 seconds most of the time
2010-09-25T23:16:51  <youwillfail> 0.01*
2010-09-25T23:17:21  <MarcAndrePC> maybe 100 ms max. Didn't make a function to calculate it
2010-09-25T23:17:22  <MarcAndrePC> but
2010-09-25T23:17:28  <Olathe> There should be something like [3492708.0979970080] on the left of each line.
2010-09-25T23:17:29  <MarcAndrePC> I will try connecting with starter package
2010-09-25T23:17:47  <MarcAndrePC> we will see where the problem is like that
2010-09-25T23:17:50  <youwillfail> you WILL want a timer for the final tournament
2010-09-25T23:18:00  <MarcAndrePC> really?
2010-09-25T23:18:00  <youwillfail> if you exceed the time limit on a turn you get disqualified
2010-09-25T23:18:20  <MarcAndrePC> yeah that's harsh
2010-09-25T23:18:31  <youwillfail> super harsh, and imo entirely unecessary
2010-09-25T23:18:34  <youwillfail> but those are the rules
2010-09-25T23:18:46  <MarcAndrePC> could just call it a lose...
2010-09-25T23:18:59  <wh1teside> either way, you will fail
2010-09-25T23:19:04  <youwillfail> i had always expected that until i got disqualfied last tournament :P
2010-09-25T23:20:26  <FlagCapper> Who's bot is vortex?
2010-09-25T23:20:32  <sigh> rwa
2010-09-25T23:20:39  <rwa> hi
2010-09-25T23:20:49  <rwa> oh yeah, those are mine
2010-09-25T23:20:54  <sigh> yay, I can summon people
2010-09-25T23:21:04  <FlagCapper> Oh, just curious, I've been playing you a lot
2010-09-25T23:21:38  <rwa> which one is yours?
2010-09-25T23:21:42  <rwa> on main site or tcp?
2010-09-25T23:21:53  <FlagCapper> Anything in the format 8-*Bot
2010-09-25T23:21:56  <rwa> ah
2010-09-25T23:21:56  <FlagCapper> tcp
2010-09-25T23:21:58  <rwa> yeah
2010-09-25T23:22:10  <sigh> there's no concept of "playing a lot" on the main site :P
2010-09-25T23:22:18  <rwa> true dat
2010-09-25T23:22:50  <youwillfail> i have no idea how they plan to run the final tournament in 5 days
2010-09-25T23:23:24  <youwillfail> i'd rather they just let it run for a week or two with a live leaderboard
2010-09-25T23:23:44  <youwillfail> (last time they closed off viewing the leaderboard while the final tournament ran, removed lots of the fun i think)
2010-09-25T23:24:09  <sigh> yeah, that would suck
2010-09-25T23:24:31  <rwa> I hope google can step up for the final tournament with some compute resources
2010-09-25T23:25:00  <rwa> I mean it's kind of ridiculous to have a contest sponsored by google running on a single shitty machine
2010-09-25T23:25:13  <rwa> that is woefully, woefully underpowered
2010-09-25T23:25:29  <sigh> well, they are starting to run on more servers now
2010-09-25T23:25:45  <rwa> cool, when did that start
2010-09-25T23:25:50  <sigh> google seems like just giving their name, and nothing else
2010-09-25T23:25:50  <youwillfail> yeah, the google thing is more of it looks good for both parties

2010-09-25T23:27:09  <sigh> DanielVonFange's post says: "I need to finish up getting games and bots distributed to cloud servers. Today I got the first cloud server up and running - although at a duct tape level."

2010-09-25T23:31:20  <Hicklc01> is the tournie a round robin or a bracket style

2010-09-25T23:35:06  <youwillfail> couldn't do round robin, too many bots
2010-09-25T23:35:25  <youwillfail> i would personally like to see one with the top 25 bots or so at the end, but i don't think it'll happen
2010-09-25T23:37:56  <Olathe> MarcAndrePC: You can try the Windows C client: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3786#p3786

2010-09-25T23:44:44  <Hicklc01> it would only take about 32 years for a round robin with 2249 bots
2010-09-25T23:45:34  <Hicklc01> ish
2010-09-25T23:46:29  <Olathe> If Google is actually sponsoring this, I'm sure they can use some huge cluster or another.
2010-09-25T23:48:01  <sigh> damn, dodgy loss: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4767240
2010-09-25T23:48:51  <davidjliu> woah, my bot also bugged out against Polski
2010-09-25T23:49:04  <davidjliu> ha, on the same map
2010-09-25T23:49:20  <davidjliu> jk, different map
