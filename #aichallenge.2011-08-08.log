2011-08-08T16:30:27  <sir_macelon> jbrechtel: maybe this will give you some clue: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/235
2011-08-08T16:30:47  <jbrechtel> Hah!  He uses me as an example.  Now I'm getting a very poor rate.
2011-08-08T16:30:50  <jbrechtel> Thanks... :)
2011-08-08T16:31:02  <sir_macelon> basicaly there seems to be a bug in the matchup engine
2011-08-08T16:31:19  <sir_macelon> mcleo already fixed the second mentioned bug there
2011-08-08T16:31:36  <sir_macelon> but it is not used yet on the site
2011-08-08T16:32:27  <sir_macelon> jbrechtel: no problem, I am also struggling with a very low game rate, over 2h per game...
2011-08-08T16:42:48  <sir_macelon> can someone merge mcleo's latest fixes to the beta server?
2011-08-08T16:43:12  <sir_macelon> there's an important update to matchmaking

2011-08-08T20:44:13  <amstan> _flag: seen mcleopold lately?
2011-08-08T20:44:37  <_flag> github says he made some small commits five days ago, otherwise no
2011-08-08T20:45:33  <amstan> i'm not sure what else is to be done, we need jeff for guidance
2011-08-08T20:46:23  <amstan> and to do things to launch
2011-08-08T20:46:40  <_flag> amstan: From what I understand the remainder of the work basically amounts to some email sending issues, matchmaking bugs and a guide for using the dev tools
2011-08-08T20:47:04  <amstan> matchmaking bugs are important..
2011-08-08T20:47:31  <_flag> What needs to be done to start the contest officially? Do you usually ask for funding from Google and then buy a few EC2 instances?

2011-08-08T23:03:24  <janzert> from the technical side the main thing holding back launch is getting the ranking system and pairing working solidly
2011-08-08T23:04:43  <janzert> email sending works fine, the part missing there is a password reset mechanism but we can launch without that (we've gone all the previous contests without it completely)
2011-08-08T23:08:14  <_flag> janzert: Who's responsible for the ranking system? The other thing that probably needs doing are these: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/starting_your_own.php, http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/simple_strategy_guide.php
2011-08-08T23:09:00  <janzert> McLeopold has done pretty much everything with the rankings/pairings so far
2011-08-08T23:09:14  <janzert> if he doesn't show back up soon I'll probably start poking my head into it
2011-08-08T23:10:41  <_flag> Okay, I was thinking about writing one of those pages however the previous ones appear to be directed at Windows users and I think most Linux users are competent enough to find their own way
2011-08-08T23:11:18  <janzert> yeah, I haven't really involved myself with site content at all
2011-08-08T23:11:40  <janzert> I don't even really know what the current state of it is
2011-08-08T23:11:56  <_flag> If you do start looking into the rankings issues, one thing I've noticed is that certain bots only play on certain types of maps. For example recently I've only played on height maps while some other bots only play on the regular symmetrical ones
2011-08-08T23:12:30  <_flag> Basically the system tends to favour the same matchups over and over again
2011-08-08T23:12:35  <janzert> I kinda noticed that too when I was poking around profile pages the other day
2011-08-08T23:13:26  <janzert> one thing I'm not looking forward to is all the pairing code got moved into sql :(
2011-08-08T23:14:17  <_flag> Yeah, I had a bit of a tough time disciphering it myself
2011-08-08T23:14:40  <janzert> but first thing is probably to write a stable accurate trueskill system anyway since we haven't been able to come up with a third party system
2011-08-08T23:14:53  <janzert> so it'll be a while before I tackle the pairing part of it
2011-08-08T23:15:14  <_flag> What's wrong with the current system?
2011-08-08T23:15:27  <janzert> it crashes on some percentage of games
2011-08-08T23:15:37  <janzert> the ones that have a skill update of 0.00
2011-08-08T23:16:22  <_flag> What if a player simply preforms "as expected"?
2011-08-08T23:16:41  <janzert> there skill should state the same basically
2011-08-08T23:17:11  <_flag> Isn't that an update of 0.00? Or am I misunderstanding the terminology?
2011-08-08T23:17:11  <janzert> actually the mu would stay the same and sigma would go down slightly
2011-08-08T23:17:41  <janzert> no, I mean the players skill next to the game in the profile page is listed as 0.00
2011-08-08T23:18:31  <_flag> Do you have an example? I've never seen that happen
2011-08-08T23:18:32  <janzert> and of course I can't find one offhand now :)
2011-08-08T23:18:38  <_flag> haha
2011-08-08T23:19:01  <_flag> Maybe it was fixed?

2011-08-08T23:19:47  <janzert> look about halfway down that page
2011-08-08T23:20:02  <janzert> actually there are 3 of them on that page
2011-08-08T23:21:12  <_flag> Could it have something to do with the fact that everyone is ranked first?
2011-08-08T23:21:35  <janzert> I think it is more likely when there is a draw in the result yes
2011-08-08T23:21:50  <janzert> so everyone drawing makes the chance much higher
2011-08-08T23:22:00  <janzert> but it isn't on every draw
2011-08-08T23:22:45  <_flag> It would be nice to see the mus, sigmas and skills of all the players in those particular games so we can see if there's any obvious relationship
2011-08-08T23:23:09  <_flag> I guess you could go to each individual profile page and check
2011-08-08T23:23:40  <janzert> not sure you would be able to get the state at the time of the game though
2011-08-08T23:24:11  <_flag> You can see the state for each player listed beside every game, no?
2011-08-08T23:24:40  <janzert> if the game is ranked correctly
2011-08-08T23:24:57  <janzert> I believe what is displayed is the updated post game information
2011-08-08T23:25:11  <janzert> but in this case you just 0.00 because the update crashed
2011-08-08T23:25:34  <_flag> Right, but the resulting information from the previous game should be what goes into the next game
2011-08-08T23:25:52  <janzert> yes
