2010-12-16T01:06:27  <antimatroid> i'm on windows too, so i can't use fork anyway aye?
2010-12-16T01:07:03  <antimatroid> my friend said he got pstreams to communicate between processes, although he's unsure whether i can connect multiple processes to a stream, or multiple streams to a process
2010-12-16T01:07:27  <antimatroid> i've got to get cygwin working first, cause i'm lazy and just use mingw
2010-12-16T01:09:03  <SmkMnstr> ah yah it would be diff in windows
2010-12-16T01:09:52  <Epona> hey antimatroid, hows the map going
2010-12-16T01:10:09  <antimatroid> Epona: maps are fine
2010-12-16T01:10:18  <antimatroid> i even have a bot to play, all i need is an engine and visualiser
2010-12-16T01:10:23  <antimatroid> and frontier mostly has a visualiser
2010-12-16T01:10:40  <antimatroid> i can't for the life of me get processes to communicate though
2010-12-16T01:10:44  <Epona> good to hear

2010-12-16T01:15:52  <sigh> antimatroid: why don't you have a look at the tcp.c file? half that program is just communicating with the process
2010-12-16T01:16:26  <sigh> I can't imagine your requirements are much different to what it is doing
2010-12-16T01:17:26  <antimatroid> sigh: i'll take a look, but i imagine it uses fork
2010-12-16T01:17:30  <antimatroid> which i don't have on windows
2010-12-16T01:17:47  <sigh> ah, yeah it would
2010-12-16T01:18:17  <antimatroid> is it easier to create a process in python?
2010-12-16T01:18:49  <sigh> yeah, it's easy... although I haven't done it on windows :)
2010-12-16T01:19:04  <antimatroid> ideally i want to be able to connect a stream to multiple processes and multiple processes to a stream

2010-12-16T02:36:48  <antimatroid> thanks
2010-12-16T02:36:50  <antimatroid> i'll play around
2010-12-16T02:36:53  <SmkMnstr> np
2010-12-16T02:37:16  <antimatroid> i'm amazed no one has already done this for me standard
2010-12-16T02:42:29  <SmkMnstr> for some reason i was readling a blank line at first
2010-12-16T02:42:32  <SmkMnstr> on windows
2010-12-16T02:42:38  <antimatroid> _open_osfhandle
2010-12-16T02:42:40  <SmkMnstr> i just read the output of ipconfig and declared success
2010-12-16T02:42:42  <SmkMnstr> heh yeah
2010-12-16T02:42:43  <antimatroid> doesn't seem to be able to find that?
2010-12-16T02:42:48  <SmkMnstr> oh
2010-12-16T02:42:53  <SmkMnstr> #include <io.h> maybe >
2010-12-16T02:43:12  <SmkMnstr> that open osfhandle crap is what took me so long to find
2010-12-16T02:43:22  <antimatroid> no love
2010-12-16T02:43:44  <SmkMnstr> fcntl.h it says
2010-12-16T02:44:23  <antimatroid> hmmm
2010-12-16T02:45:07  <SmkMnstr> oh another doc says io.h
2010-12-16T02:45:15  <SmkMnstr> im sure ull find it
2010-12-16T02:46:13  <SmkMnstr> windows.h if not already
2010-12-16T02:48:28  <antimatroid> hmm, compiles when i use mingw
2010-12-16T02:48:44  <antimatroid> i'll just use mingw for the moment and see where i get
2010-12-16T02:48:47  <antimatroid> cheers again :)
2010-12-16T02:49:55  <SmkMnstr> word
2010-12-16T02:51:22  <antimatroid> will it work if i try to make the pipe between a process and stringstream?
2010-12-16T02:56:11  <antimatroid> wait, nevermind, i'm being silly, i don't even need that
2010-12-16T03:04:36  <antimatroid> SmkMnstr: the created process still doesn't seem to want to take stuff from print
2010-12-16T03:11:40  <SmkMnstr> it works for me i just tested it
2010-12-16T03:11:48  <SmkMnstr> running cmd.exe
2010-12-16T03:11:58  <SmkMnstr> and printing "dir\r\n"
2010-12-16T03:12:09  <SmkMnstr> make sure u put the newline after ur string
2010-12-16T03:12:44  <antimatroid> got it
2010-12-16T03:12:53  <antimatroid> yeah, just realised i wasn't adding \n
2010-12-16T03:12:56  <antimatroid> :):):)
2010-12-16T03:13:38  <SmkMnstr> cool
2010-12-16T03:13:55  <SmkMnstr> its pretty nice impl because the FILE* is the same only need the ifdef for open
2010-12-16T03:14:19  <SmkMnstr> normally you would do the read / write a little bit different
2010-12-16T03:14:42  <SmkMnstr> the get_input() and print()
2010-12-16T03:14:48  <antimatroid> yeah, i just want to get this working at this point, i'll worry about making it nice later
2010-12-16T03:14:55  <SmkMnstr> it may come up later, needing to determine if data is available to be read
2010-12-16T03:14:57  <antimatroid> i might overload << and >>
2010-12-16T03:15:20  <SmkMnstr> yeah
2010-12-16T03:15:20  <antimatroid> yeah, i need to work out how to read from people iff there is something to be read
2010-12-16T03:15:54  <SmkMnstr> yeah there is probably somre more similar code for doin that :)
2010-12-16T03:16:28  <SmkMnstr> again with ifdefs for windows
2010-12-16T03:16:48  <SmkMnstr> i think you can use select() on fileno(in) and fileno(out) on win,mac,lin
2010-12-16T03:17:12  <SmkMnstr> but by time u get to select u might change it from even being FILE*
2010-12-16T03:17:16  <SmkMnstr> or who knows, it may never come to that for u
2010-12-16T03:17:33  <antimatroid> i need it before i can finish my engine
2010-12-16T03:17:38  <antimatroid> but i'll worry about that when i get there

2010-12-16T08:50:38  <delt0r_> you have that before --no?
2010-12-16T08:55:26  <antimatroid> yeah, different place
2010-12-16T08:55:31  <antimatroid> i just got rid of them

2010-12-16T09:02:02  <antimatroid> delt0r_: you're in favour of ignoring invalid moves aren't you?
2010-12-16T09:02:08  <antimatroid> to what degree of invalid?
2010-12-16T09:02:17  <delt0r_> mistakes...
2010-12-16T09:02:23  <delt0r_> not clear cheating
2010-12-16T09:02:36  <antimatroid> okay
2010-12-16T09:02:46  <delt0r_> but all input data should be fully sanitized anyway
2010-12-16T09:03:02  <delt0r_> void buffer overflows etc so it can't be hacked
2010-12-16T09:03:07  <antimatroid> i'm going to create vectors of strings of "bad" moves and just ignore them for the moment
2010-12-16T09:03:39  <delt0r_> but really... just ignoring a command --with perhaps a warning...is easier for beginners.
2010-12-16T09:03:44  <antimatroid> i was thinking of allowing ants to walk onto a wall and die, but then i was going to let them attack a wall or empty square, which didn't seem right
2010-12-16T09:03:59  <delt0r_> it means one little bug isn't "I keep "timeing out...etc

2010-12-16T09:11:05  <antimatroid> do you just take the first move they issue for an ant?
2010-12-16T09:12:28  <delt0r_> usally the last
2010-12-16T09:12:47  <antimatroid> yep, that's just as easy
2010-12-16T09:13:09  <delt0r_> its nice to set it as the last...
2010-12-16T09:13:22  <delt0r_> and permit  orders/instructing to change
2010-12-16T09:13:51  <delt0r_> this way they can refine orders it there are cpu cycles to do with
2010-12-16T09:15:39  <antimatroid> yep
2010-12-16T09:17:49  <antimatroid> i basically have to process my moves in 3 steps, but if i do that it works fine

2010-12-16T20:27:37  <javagamer> I've just learned enough to sync my current project from my laptop to my desktop without a central server
2010-12-16T20:28:02  <javagamer> Which is nice because before I just SFTP'd it over every time I wanted to switch, and I had no versioning so I was commenting stuff out a lot

2010-12-16T23:30:23  <sigh> debugging is a colourless unicorn
2010-12-16T23:30:33  <Cyndre> so I spent last night diagramming my new bot
2010-12-16T23:30:51  <Cyndre> no longer will he split anything up - Im going to make it read character by character and output character by character
2010-12-16T23:31:41  <antimatroid> i'm getting frustrated with my engine
2010-12-16T23:31:47  <Cyndre> so each character will be like a neuron and have a memory.  When activated it will store the previous 30 characters that were activated
2010-12-16T23:32:00  <sigh> scoreme
2010-12-16T23:32:01  <CyndreBot_> sigh, your current score is 97.
2010-12-16T23:32:05  <antimatroid> it's stalling sometimes when collectng something from a bot
2010-12-16T23:32:13  <antimatroid> not from the bot stalling either
2010-12-16T23:32:21  <sigh> are you dong nonblocking io?
2010-12-16T23:32:30  <sigh> *doing
2010-12-16T23:32:33  <Cyndre> does the bot need to flush anything for the engine to accept?
2010-12-16T23:32:43  <antimatroid> hmm, that's a good point
2010-12-16T23:32:44  <Cyndre> or do you have a command termination string?
2010-12-16T23:33:15  <antimatroid> so ifbot1 process couts something and i don't shut off io for bot 2 there then bot2 will see that?
2010-12-16T23:33:27  <antimatroid> go is my command termination string
2010-12-16T23:34:26  <sigh> antimatroid: I don't see how that could happen
2010-12-16T23:35:21  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/z04Z3epm
2010-12-16T23:35:21  <antimatroid> this is my current specification stuff
2010-12-16T23:35:39  <antimatroid> i removed maxHarvest
2010-12-16T23:35:54  <sigh> why?
2010-12-16T23:36:08  <antimatroid> because it just made it even more complicated without adding much strategy wise
2010-12-16T23:36:26  <antimatroid> you still want to set up supply lines so you don't send all ants back to the base
2010-12-16T23:36:41  <antimatroid> and if you have an ant carrying lots of grains, they can come steal them from you
2010-12-16T23:36:43  <sigh> what if it overflows INT_MAX?
2010-12-16T23:36:57  <antimatroid> don't add that many grains to the board :P
2010-12-16T23:37:01  <sigh> :(
2010-12-16T23:37:16  <antimatroid> not all squares start with grains
2010-12-16T23:37:32  <antimatroid> you can still have heaps of grain
2010-12-16T23:42:10  <antimatroid> i'm thinking bases will start with an ant and 9 grains
2010-12-16T23:42:39  <antimatroid> an ant spawns every move there are grains there too now, if you left an ant sitting there, they fuse
2010-12-16T23:45:16  <antimatroid> i don't actually use cout/cin from the engine to communicate with the other process, i just use string streams to pass stuff to the processes with fgets and fputs
2010-12-16T23:57:49  <sigh> fgets is blocking, IIRC
2010-12-16T23:58:18  <sigh> it's jut going to hang if the stream hasn't finished but there is no more data yet
