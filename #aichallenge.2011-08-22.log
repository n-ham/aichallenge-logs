2011-08-22T03:00:41  <mleise> Eclipse's JavaScript support just showed me a bug where I forgot a break in a switch-case-statement. Very nice.
2011-08-22T03:02:50  <rabidus> eclipse rocks
2011-08-22T03:03:15  <rabidus> however it gets very slow when i open "big" file
2011-08-22T03:03:19  <rabidus> like .. +2000 lines
2011-08-22T03:03:49  <rabidus> every letter you type takes 'bout 1 second
2011-08-22T03:03:56  <mleise> hehe, you never tried NetBeans, did you?
2011-08-22T03:04:41  <rabidus> daily
2011-08-22T03:04:56  <rabidus> netbeans is much faster what comes to source editing
2011-08-22T03:05:10  <rabidus> however those other 'views' are _freakin_ slow :)
2011-08-22T03:05:18  <rabidus> at least in j2me development
2011-08-22T03:05:34  <mleise> JavaScript editing was really slow for me when I wanted to use code completion
2011-08-22T03:05:56  <rabidus> never tested
2011-08-22T03:06:03  <mleise> On the other hand Eclipse's support - while now generally better - crashes now and then.
2011-08-22T03:06:10  <rabidus> :O
2011-08-22T03:06:14  <rabidus> never has crashed
2011-08-22T03:07:06  <mleise> But I had to realize that my switch-case was correct. I wanted the fall-through
2011-08-22T03:08:01  <rabidus> it was just a suggestion
2011-08-22T03:08:13  <rabidus> fall-through is kinda rare usage
2011-08-22T03:08:25  <mleise> rabidus: and when I have "MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function() { ... }" and I invoke "add documentation" the stupid thing adds the documentation between "=" and "function" :p
2011-08-22T03:08:41  <rabidus> i don't javascript
2011-08-22T03:09:13  <mleise> Basically that's the way you add methods to your classes
2011-08-22T03:09:38  <mleise> since JS doesn't have a concept of classes, but prototype objects
2011-08-22T03:22:51  <mleise> rabidus: C++ and Java are again the most used languages in this contest by a huge margin
2011-08-22T03:23:24  <rabidus> haven't checked things
2011-08-22T03:24:53  <mleise> I wrote some SQL when I was interested in the language statistics.
2011-08-22T03:25:08  <rabidus> i'm sql heavy user

2011-08-22T03:34:44  <rabidus> related to .. ?
2011-08-22T03:34:54  <mleise> SQL heavy user + Java = Hibernate experience
2011-08-22T03:35:17  <rabidus> nah, sql+php and different project @ java
2011-08-22T03:35:25  <rabidus> two different projects
2011-08-22T03:35:41  <rabidus> well, they are related via internet :p
2011-08-22T03:36:46  <mleise> Some Java fan boys would probably have neat ideas to replace the php with some jsp stuff
2011-08-22T03:37:31  <rabidus> yeah well... what comes to web development, jquery is heavily in use
2011-08-22T03:37:49  <mleise> I guess there are infrastructures for everything now in Java. JavaBeans are probably omni-present for example. From GUIs to assembling modules of a project

2011-08-22T12:15:31  <mcstar> i have a halogene desk lamp
2011-08-22T12:15:42  <mleise> me too, it is not strange to me
2011-08-22T12:15:50  <mcstar> if i turn it on, the usb keyboard's led(numlock) switched satte
2011-08-22T12:15:52  <mcstar> state
2011-08-22T12:16:02  <mcstar> switches*
2011-08-22T12:16:02  <mleise> haha
2011-08-22T12:16:12  <mcstar> i noticed this earlier
2011-08-22T12:16:29  <mcstar> but now i have a ps2 keyboard plugged in(different to type on, sometimes better)
2011-08-22T12:16:41  <mcstar> and now the mouse just reinitialized itself(usb)
2011-08-22T12:16:58  <mleise> you have a fail-usb
2011-08-22T12:16:59  <mcstar> i know, because the acceleration settings are gone
2011-08-22T12:17:09  <mcstar> i use xset m 1.5 10, and now its way faster
2011-08-22T12:17:46  <mcstar> i dont have any other problem with the usb ports
2011-08-22T12:17:52  <mleise> is this a notebook? with battery?
2011-08-22T12:18:00  <mcstar> desktop
2011-08-22T12:18:33  <mcstar> i recently changed to a better quality power supply, and it happens with both
2011-08-22T12:18:59  <mleise> so it is not the power supply, thats really strange man
2011-08-22T12:19:12  <mcstar> i know
2011-08-22T12:19:51  <mcstar> its very deterministic, i can reproduce it anytime
2011-08-22T12:20:07  <mleise> you could try and move the lamp farther away
2011-08-22T12:20:20  <mleise> maybe it is radiactive or something
2011-08-22T12:20:25  <mleise> *radioactive
2011-08-22T12:20:27  <mcstar> yeah, but then it wouldnt light my desk woudl it?
2011-08-22T12:20:50  <mcstar> mleise: it isnt readioactive
2011-08-22T12:20:54  <mleise> no, but you would know if it is radiating
2011-08-22T12:20:57  <mcstar> lol, was this a joke?
2011-08-22T12:21:13  <mcstar> radiating != radioactive
2011-08-22T12:21:14  <mleise> it was, but what can you do when things are so strange
2011-08-22T12:22:31  <mcstar> well, i think the tail of the mouse and the cord of the keyboard pick up a slight voltage increase when the transient happens, and the controller thinks it is being overloaded, and shuts down for just a moment
2011-08-22T12:23:06  <mleise> in 2008 someone claimed to have detected proteins in tyranoosaur bones. these proteins should survive even a million years
2011-08-22T12:23:09  <mcstar> sry, not overloaded, thats cleary stupid, but it might have a over-voltage protection
2011-08-22T12:23:40  <mleise> yes that could be
2011-08-22T12:23:58  <mcstar> damn proteins, do they mess with my keyboard??
2011-08-22T12:25:16  <mleise> do you mind an analogy? :p
2011-08-22T12:25:29  <mcstar> analogy patology
2011-08-22T12:25:37  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-22T12:26:08  <mleise> ? so now the sun is almost gone
2011-08-22T12:26:39  <mcstar> what? did i miss a sentence?
2011-08-22T12:26:46  <mcstar> what do you mean the sun is gone?
2011-08-22T12:27:03  <mleise> no, i didn't understand you and got back to my idea of enjoying the sun
2011-08-22T12:27:12  <mcstar> :)
2011-08-22T12:27:24  <mcstar> what did you not understand?
2011-08-22T12:27:32  <mleise> analogy patology
2011-08-22T12:27:34  <mcstar> i thought you understand everything
2011-08-22T12:27:39  <mcstar> ah thats a stupid joke
2011-08-22T12:28:01  <mcstar> analogy is good for distracting one from the real subject
2011-08-22T12:28:21  <mcstar> if you dont understand something, you might think that an analogy will help
2011-08-22T12:28:55  <mcstar> but surely, it will only carry you away, since you used analogy to describe something you didnt understand in the first place
2011-08-22T12:29:16  <mcstar> analogy is only acceptable if someone, who is an expert in what he is talking about uses it
2011-08-22T12:29:27  <mcstar> so he knows the limitation of the given analogy
2011-08-22T12:29:36  <mcstar> basically that shwat i meant by that
2011-08-22T12:30:15  <mleise> ah ok, i thought patalogy was referring to the decaying proteins
2011-08-22T12:30:22  <mcstar> nah :)
2011-08-22T12:30:28  <mleise> so im gone for a while
