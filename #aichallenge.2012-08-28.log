2012-08-28T12:14:02  <pairofdice> Could it be? division?
2012-08-28T12:14:07  <mcstar> fuck yeah
2012-08-28T12:14:20  <mcstar> there is division, i just forgot about division
2012-08-28T12:14:23  <mcstar> it is dangerous
2012-08-28T12:17:16  <mcstar> ah, i forgot, system of...
2012-08-28T12:18:48  <mcstar> the problem fits on 1 screenful of mathematica
2012-08-28T12:18:53  <mcstar> but this is slow now
2012-08-28T12:19:08  <mcstar> ive got to modify my spectral collocation solver
2012-08-28T12:19:19  <mcstar> which is in python
2012-08-28T12:19:53  <mcstar> and then, hope, that it wont diverge, with some naive implicit time stepping

2012-08-28T13:10:46  <mcstar> thestinger: is there a python idiom for initializing names to a certain value, or with a function's return value?
2012-08-28T13:11:19  <mcstar> x = fun(), but for a bunch of names, not just x
2012-08-28T13:11:30  <thestinger> not really
2012-08-28T13:11:41  <thestinger> there are decorators though... but I don't think that's what you want
2012-08-28T13:12:13  <mcstar> no
2012-08-28T13:13:15  <mcstar> im there is some hack
2012-08-28T13:13:21  <mcstar> im sure*
2012-08-28T13:13:41  <mcstar> the way python works, is too dynamic for this to not be possible
2012-08-28T13:14:04  <mcstar> maybe, i just need to add the names as string to a dictionary
2012-08-28T13:14:27  <mcstar> probably every class has a dict with its member variables
2012-08-28T13:14:27  <thestinger> well functions in a dictionary is perfectly idiomatic
2012-08-28T13:14:32  <thestinger> yes
2012-08-28T13:14:34  <thestinger> .__dict__
2012-08-28T13:14:39  <mcstar> ok, so i use that
2012-08-28T13:15:00  <mcstar> for s in ('x','y'...): self.__dict__[s] = fun()
2012-08-28T13:15:51  <thestinger> you don't need the () around the tuple there btw
2012-08-28T13:16:37  <mcstar> it is for readability
2012-08-28T13:16:55  <thestinger> more readable without imo :P
2012-08-28T13:17:08  <mcstar> i just said that
2012-08-28T13:17:21  <mcstar> but i mean it is better wo parens too
2012-08-28T13:17:30  <thestinger> oh
2012-08-28T13:18:05  <thestinger> the tuple syntax is kinda weird since the parens are only needed to make it not ambiguous
2012-08-28T13:18:10  <thestinger> I find it weird that 1, is a tuple
2012-08-28T13:18:10  <mcstar> so, i guess this is kind of metaprogramming in python
2012-08-28T13:18:52  <mcstar> in python there is distinction between a value, and a tuple of one
2012-08-28T13:19:01  <mcstar> this is nonsense
2012-08-28T13:19:16  <mcstar> in haskell you cant have a 1 tuple
2012-08-28T13:19:22  <mcstar> which is natural
2012-08-28T13:19:26  <thestinger> but you can have () :P
2012-08-28T13:19:33  <mcstar> thats somethign else
2012-08-28T13:19:56  <mcstar> () could have been anything else
2012-08-28T13:20:10  <thestinger> yes but lots of languages consider it the 0-tuple
2012-08-28T13:20:11  <mcstar> and, yesterday i was just thinking about that
2012-08-28T13:20:20  <thestinger> since each tuple is a different type anyway
2012-08-28T13:20:30  <thestinger> (well not *each*)
2012-08-28T13:20:32  <mcstar> in ocaml, it is frequently the case, that you want a function, that takes no arguments
2012-08-28T13:20:44  <mcstar> but you have to definite it with (), let fun () =
2012-08-28T13:20:48  <mcstar> and call like fun ()
2012-08-28T13:20:50  <pairofdice> How is it nonsense
2012-08-28T13:21:04  <mcstar> and it would be better to have 1 letter symbol for unit
2012-08-28T13:21:11  <mcstar> like f -
2012-08-28T13:21:25  <thestinger> pairofdice: because python tuples are not tuples
2012-08-28T13:21:28  <thestinger> is his point
2012-08-28T13:21:58  <thestinger> python tuples are immutable lists (for python's definition of a list)
2012-08-28T13:22:11  <thestinger> they pretty much only exist because a list can't be used as a dict key
2012-08-28T13:22:33  <thestinger> you can do 'tuple' unpacking with list syntax too
2012-08-28T13:22:57  <thestinger> [[foo, bar]] = [[1, 2]]
2012-08-28T13:23:19  <mcstar> yeah, but for example, for multiple return values, i prefer a tuple
2012-08-28T13:23:33  <thestinger> yes, makes more semantic sense
2012-08-28T13:23:41  <mcstar> i dont think i ever had to unpack a list
2012-08-28T13:23:48  <mcstar> in python i mean
2012-08-28T13:23:56  <thestinger> mcstar: well in python3 there is more pattern matching
2012-08-28T13:24:13  <thestinger> >>> head, *tail = [1,2,3,4,5]
2012-08-28T13:24:15  <mcstar> yeah, but can you match like first:rest?
2012-08-28T13:24:16  <thestinger> >>> head
2012-08-28T13:24:18  <thestinger> 1
2012-08-28T13:24:19  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-28T13:24:20  <thestinger> >>> tail
2012-08-28T13:24:22  <thestinger> [2, 3, 4, 5]
2012-08-28T13:24:24  <mcstar> great
2012-08-28T13:24:39  <mcstar> like the way args** works
2012-08-28T13:24:47  <thestinger> you could also do first, second, *middle, last = xs
2012-08-28T13:24:54  <mcstar> i mean, a function decomposes its arguments the same way
2012-08-28T13:24:55  <mcstar> i think
2012-08-28T13:25:03  <thestinger> yeah, similar
2012-08-28T13:25:09  <thestinger> mcstar: you also know about the apply syntax right?
2012-08-28T13:25:12  <thestinger> it's the same
2012-08-28T13:25:20  <mcstar> i know about apply, but not in python
2012-08-28T13:25:25  <thestinger> it's just *
2012-08-28T13:25:31  <thestinger> for example transpose is zip(*xs)
2012-08-28T13:25:36  <mcstar> right
2012-08-28T13:26:56  <mcstar> i dont use python3
2012-08-28T13:27:03  <thestinger> you will eventually
2012-08-28T13:27:20  <mcstar> probably because i have a svript that is hardcoded to start ipython2
2012-08-28T13:27:28  <mcstar> but if i change that...
2012-08-28T13:27:34  <mcstar> i could be using python3
2012-08-28T13:28:16  <mcstar> numpy and these stuff work with p3, so theres no reason i shouldnt use it
2012-08-28T13:28:36  <thestinger> it's nicer :P
2012-08-28T13:30:21  <mcstar> thestinger: i remember now, i didnt use it because theres no print
2012-08-28T13:30:25  <mcstar> wo parens
2012-08-28T13:30:44  <mcstar> and its a pain to rewrite my scripts...
2012-08-28T13:30:48  <thestinger> mcstar: 2to3
2012-08-28T13:30:48  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-28T13:31:07  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-28T13:31:25  <mcstar> i thought you left the prefix of the converter off
2012-08-28T13:31:34  <mcstar> but it is really called '2to3'
2012-08-28T13:31:44  <mcstar> how arrogant that is
2012-08-28T13:33:23  <thestinger> print as a function is nicer
2012-08-28T13:33:54  <thestinger> there are sep, file and end as optional args, and you can do 'builtins.print = some_other_func'
2012-08-28T13:34:06  <mcstar> i dont argue with that
2012-08-28T13:34:11  <mcstar> but it was andy before too
2012-08-28T13:34:14  <mcstar> handy
2012-08-28T13:34:21  <mcstar> wo parens
2012-08-28T13:34:44  <thestinger> well, saves 1 char in the common case :P
2012-08-28T13:36:17  <thestinger> mcstar: well there are plenty of nice changes anyway
2012-08-28T13:36:34  <thestinger> map, zip, etc. are what itertools.{izip,imap} are in py2
2012-08-28T13:36:40  <thestinger> (lazy generators)
2012-08-28T13:36:57  <thestinger> I use the @functools.lru_cache generator all the time
2012-08-28T13:37:05  <thestinger> which exists because py3 adds proper closures with nonlocal
2012-08-28T13:37:08  <mcstar> i wonder why
2012-08-28T13:37:27  <thestinger> s/generator/decorator/
2012-08-28T13:37:31  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-28T13:37:35  <mcstar> memoizer?
2012-08-28T13:37:44  <mleise> it's not just one character, typing ( and ) always results in an awkward little finger on shift while reaching for 8 or 9 with the middle finger
2012-08-28T13:37:52  <thestinger> mcstar: yes, with or without an LRU cache algorithm
2012-08-28T13:38:04  <thestinger> mcstar: http://docs.python.org/dev/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache
2012-08-28T13:38:16  <thestinger> easy enough to make yourself though
2012-08-28T13:38:25  <mcstar> mleise: !
2012-08-28T13:38:30  <mcstar> mleise: hai!
2012-08-28T13:38:54  <mleise> hey. i wasn't away for too long, was I?
2012-08-28T13:39:09  <thestinger> mleise: well that's why you use an editor that auto-closes parens
2012-08-28T13:39:12  <mcstar> im just generally happy when there is a crowd
2012-08-28T13:39:14  <mleise> after all this channel has been dead for months before
2012-08-28T13:39:18  <mcstar> and 3 ppl are a crowd
2012-08-28T13:39:20  <thestinger> and autocompletion will put the first one for you :P
2012-08-28T13:39:40  <mcstar> thestinger: i hate that feature
2012-08-28T13:39:49  <mleise> thestinger: no IDE for D auto-inserts the first ( unfortunately
2012-08-28T13:39:55  <thestinger> mleise: https://github.com/Townk/vim-autoclose
2012-08-28T13:40:08  <thestinger> although I bet it's broken in some langs
2012-08-28T13:40:10  <mleise> not even as an optional feature, and I wont use vim -.-
2012-08-28T13:40:21  <thestinger> well emacs will do it too...
2012-08-28T13:40:32  <mleise> thanks, I already have an OS installed
2012-08-28T13:40:50  <pairofdice> An annoying feature unless you can skip over it easily
2012-08-28T13:40:57  <mleise> lru_cache is called memoize in D btw ;)
2012-08-28T13:41:28  <pairofdice> probably works in vim nicely with the hjkil and in eclipse it's nice
2012-08-28T13:41:37  <thestinger> https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object that is the best thing ever for python/haskell though
2012-08-28T13:42:55  <mcstar> i use bare emacs, but the ipython qtconsole has nice bulk editing capabilities
2012-08-28T13:43:12  <mleise> what is bulk editing?
2012-08-28T13:43:32  <mleise> poor man's refactoring?
2012-08-28T13:44:16  <thestinger> mcstar: do you use haskell-mode?
2012-08-28T13:48:54  <mcstar> thestinger: no, not with python
2012-08-28T13:49:02  <thestinger> mcstar: lol, you know what I mean :P
2012-08-28T13:49:11  <mcstar> mleise: in contrast to line editing
2012-08-28T13:49:23  <mcstar> you can edit multi-line input
2012-08-28T13:49:31  <mcstar> it is handy
2012-08-28T13:49:44  <mcstar> and ipython has a lot of magic commands
2012-08-28T13:49:49  <mleise> O.o it is standard since 1980
2012-08-28T13:49:57  <mcstar> what?
2012-08-28T13:50:04  <mleise> use notepad, it can edit multiple lines
2012-08-28T13:50:13  <mcstar> you are missing the point
2012-08-28T13:50:19  <thestinger> mcstar: you can edit multiple lines in zsh/bash too :P
2012-08-28T13:50:27  <mcstar> it is a gui notebook for python
2012-08-28T13:50:31  <mcstar> you can even inline graphics
2012-08-28T13:50:38  <mcstar> thestinger: i know
2012-08-28T13:50:46  <mcstar> but it is better in this
2012-08-28T13:50:52  <mcstar> anyway, fuck off you two
2012-08-28T13:51:07  <mcstar> thestinger: and yes, i use haskell-mode for haskell source editing
2012-08-28T13:51:16  <mcstar> since otherwise, you wouldnt even have syntax coloring
2012-08-28T13:51:22  <mcstar> or nice indenting
2012-08-28T13:51:44  <mcstar> but i usually dont load code into ghci from emacs, but run a console ghci session
2012-08-28T13:51:58  <thestinger> ghci is weird
2012-08-28T13:52:03  <mcstar> emacs-python integration is better probably
2012-08-28T13:52:12  <mcstar> that could replace ipython qtconsole
2012-08-28T13:52:20  <mcstar> but i havent bothered with it so far
2012-08-28T13:52:31  <mcstar> thestinger: why is it weird?
2012-08-28T13:52:42  <thestinger> because you can't define data types, etc.
2012-08-28T13:52:56  <thestinger> I realize you're supposed to use it with a set of files though
2012-08-28T13:53:18  <mcstar> mleise: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html
2012-08-28T13:53:24  <mcstar> thestinger: what?
2012-08-28T13:53:27  <mcstar> sure you can

2012-08-28T13:53:40  <mcstar> you can have multiple line inputs even
2012-08-28T13:53:59  <mcstar> without special syntax even
2012-08-28T13:54:01  <thestinger> mcstar: how then?
2012-08-28T13:54:10  <mcstar> idk, what do you want to do?
2012-08-28T13:54:51  <mcstar> (but generally it is better to load up whole files/modules, and experiment with the content)
2012-08-28T13:55:03  <mcstar> thestinger: give me an example of what you want to do
2012-08-28T13:55:30  <thestinger> define a data type (record or ADT)
2012-08-28T13:55:39  <thestinger> it won't let you without loading it from a file

2012-08-28T13:58:03  <thestinger> same thing with type classes afaik
2012-08-28T13:58:04  <mleise> mcstar: so IPython is a glorified shell for Python that integrates with GUI applications as well?
2012-08-28T13:58:25  <thestinger> mleise: it's part of the project that does numpy/scipy
2012-08-28T13:58:49  <thestinger> so it's meant to be integrated with that stuff
2012-08-28T13:59:07  <mcstar> http://imgur.com/fVcvC
2012-08-28T13:59:30  <mcstar> no, it doesnt integrate with gui applicatinos
2012-08-28T14:00:06  <mcstar> it is a frontend for python, has console, gui and web interfaces
2012-08-28T14:00:08  <thestinger> :0
2012-08-28T14:00:20  <mcstar> thestinger: hm?

2012-08-28T14:00:44  <mcstar> idk
2012-08-28T14:00:56  <mcstar> it didnt work in older versions
2012-08-28T14:01:02  <mcstar> im not sure when did this change
2012-08-28T14:01:09  <mcstar> after 6.9 or 7.2
2012-08-28T14:01:15  <thestinger> oh
2012-08-28T14:01:33  <thestinger> I haven't really used it much since arch had the really old version
2012-08-28T14:01:47  <thestinger> long before they dropped haskell-platform
2012-08-28T14:02:01  <mcstar> lots have changed since then
2012-08-28T14:02:09  <mcstar> btw, did you see my prompt?
2012-08-28T14:02:25  <thestinger> yeah, I tried it before
2012-08-28T14:02:28  <thestinger> when we were debugging :P
2012-08-28T14:02:34  <mcstar> ah, yeah, silly me
2012-08-28T14:02:52  <thestinger> I might put the current git branch in mine
2012-08-28T14:02:54  <mcstar> the same as before, except colorwise
2012-08-28T14:02:57  <thestinger> I always commit to the wrong branch
2012-08-28T14:06:59  <Tombana> hello. This question probably gets asked very often, but what is the status on the next AI challenge?
2012-08-28T14:08:28  <mleise> It is undecided
2012-08-28T14:08:36  <mcstar> not much is happening unfortunately
2012-08-28T14:08:44  <mcstar> the status is not undecided
2012-08-28T14:12:11  <Tombana> ok
2012-08-28T14:12:27  <Tombana> thanks
2012-08-28T14:13:04  <ejls> Next question, is the moment when the undecided get decided also undecided?
2012-08-28T14:13:58  <mcstar> undecided ad infinitum
2012-08-28T14:14:36  <mcstar> my humble opinion, is that there isnt going to be a contest this year
2012-08-28T14:16:42  <pairofdice> Doesn't seem likely
2012-08-28T14:17:01  <Tombana> thats too bad, ants was the most awesome thing i ever programmed
2012-08-28T14:19:02  <mcstar> but check back in every couple of weeks
2012-08-28T14:19:07  <mcstar> things can change
2012-08-28T14:19:32  <ejls> An unknow saviour can still clone the git repo and propose a new challenge. I'm going to sacrifice a chicken.
2012-08-28T14:19:34  <mcstar> the current game/web framework is working
2012-08-28T14:19:59  <mcstar> so if the they decide to write a game, it could be done in this year
2012-08-28T14:20:21  <mcstar> ejls: thats not the real problem
2012-08-28T14:20:35  <mcstar> if you have enough money to run the contest on your own, do it

2012-08-28T14:55:25  <mleise> It is actually pretty brutal. It's the same level of brutality playing as both alien and predator, but the predator is more human like, so psychologically there is a stronger sense of identification. I can understand that it wasn't sold here.

2012-08-28T16:37:21  <mcstar> damn lame story, but has a 7.1 rating on imdb
2012-08-28T16:44:54  <mleise> i remember some scenes
2012-08-28T16:45:12  <mleise> I'm going to watch it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhkhJx7t2GA
2012-08-28T16:45:30  <mleise> after all it has 'cult' status, right?
2012-08-28T16:46:17  <mleise> oh that's the german version. youtube is too kind.
2012-08-28T16:48:24  <mcstar> idk, didnt know it was a badass moive
2012-08-28T16:48:52  <mcstar> from the looks of the clip i watched, id guess its a mega lame ass movie with a 2.5 rating
2012-08-28T17:11:41  <mcstar> stupid youtube stops playback in every 15 minutes

2012-08-28T17:35:24  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-28T17:35:30  <mcstar> thestinger: i forgot a 'return'
2012-08-28T17:35:44  <mcstar> i give back a None from a function instead of an array
2012-08-28T17:35:58  <thestinger> that's where lightspark would be nice
2012-08-28T17:35:59  <mcstar> and then i call a c function with none
2012-08-28T17:36:11  <mcstar> and this killed python
2012-08-28T17:36:22  <mcstar> but i didnt get any error messages or anything
2012-08-28T17:36:33  <mcstar> whats lightspark?\
2012-08-28T17:36:58  <mcstar> btw, this explicit return is a bit annoying
2012-08-28T17:37:04  <mcstar> not the first time i forget it
2012-08-28T17:37:19  <mcstar> since in functional languages you dont have epxlicit return
2012-08-28T17:37:37  <mcstar> julia has a return, but it isnt mandatory
2012-08-28T17:37:44  <mcstar> you can exit with return early
2012-08-28T17:37:52  <mcstar> otherwise, last statement gets returned
2012-08-28T17:38:27  <thestinger> I mean light table
2012-08-28T17:38:32  <thestinger> stupid brain is buggy
2012-08-28T17:39:07  <thestinger> the implicit return in python is always None though
2012-08-28T17:39:56  <thestinger> mcstar: it's saner with static typing
2012-08-28T17:41:44  <mcstar> thestinger: you lost your spark
2012-08-28T17:41:58  <mcstar> yeah its none
2012-08-28T17:42:07  <mcstar> but apparently some things dont check for it
2012-08-28T17:42:15  <thestinger> it's actually explicit in the bytecode
2012-08-28T17:42:22  <thestinger> just not the human form :P
2012-08-28T17:42:28  <mcstar> i dont think its a good idea for an api to a c lib, to assume everything is clled correctly
2012-08-28T17:42:42  <thestinger> mcstar: you mean ctypes?
2012-08-28T17:42:52  <mcstar> idk
2012-08-28T17:43:04  <thestinger> ctypes lets you specify the return type and argument types for every function
2012-08-28T17:43:11  <mcstar> i think its the programmer's responsibility in python to check corretc iinput
2012-08-28T17:43:13  <mcstar> isnt it?
2012-08-28T17:43:50  <thestinger> well ctypes won't let you pass incorrect stuff because it converts it first
2012-08-28T17:43:54  <mcstar> thestinger: is there an implicit conversion, from None to the 'correct' type?
2012-08-28T17:44:03  <mcstar> i dont know what happened here
2012-08-28T17:44:03  <thestinger> mcstar: where?
2012-08-28T17:44:13  <mcstar> in the binding
2012-08-28T17:44:21  <thestinger> which binding? :P
2012-08-28T17:44:21  <mcstar> im not sure how it is done
2012-08-28T17:44:35  <mcstar> but you mentioned ctypes, it is probable, that ffwt uses ctypes
2012-08-28T17:44:47  <mcstar> if thats the default type marshalling for python->c
2012-08-28T17:44:50  <thestinger> no
2012-08-28T17:44:57  <thestinger> usually people use the cpython extension API
2012-08-28T17:45:01  <mcstar> fftw
2012-08-28T17:45:02  <thestinger> which requires writing code in C
2012-08-28T17:45:18  <thestinger> but that only works for cpython
2012-08-28T17:45:38  <thestinger> so ctypes is starting to become more popular (pypy optimizes it well too, cpython has overhead for a ctypes call)
2012-08-28T17:45:39  <mcstar> it is tied somewhat to numpy
2012-08-28T17:45:50  <thestinger> mcstar: ah, then almost certaintly a cpython extension
2012-08-28T17:45:52  <mcstar> and that is primairly works on cpython
2012-08-28T17:45:54  <mcstar> so..
2012-08-28T17:46:02  <mcstar> -is
2012-08-28T17:46:08  <thestinger> so they have code written in C, that takes python objects as arguments
2012-08-28T17:46:19  <thestinger> so it's their job to wrap it in a way that doesn't have the ability to crash
2012-08-28T17:46:26  <thestinger> but it's easy for them to screw up
2012-08-28T17:46:38  <thestinger> and by crash I mean die without throwing an exception
2012-08-28T17:48:44  <mcstar> thestinger: is there a print-with-flush?
2012-08-28T17:49:42  <thestinger> well you can sys.stdout.flush()
2012-08-28T17:50:06  <thestinger> so you could wrap print
2012-08-28T17:50:33  <mcstar> im using that
2012-08-28T17:50:48  <mcstar> i thought there is function already
2012-08-28T17:51:00  <mcstar> there was *
2012-08-28T17:51:04  <mcstar> a
2012-08-28T17:51:11  <mcstar> getting late
2012-08-28T17:56:22  <thestinger> anyway ctypes does throw an exception if you pass the wrong arg type
2012-08-28T17:56:30  <thestinger> when you make ctypes bindings you specify all the types
2012-08-28T17:56:46  <thestinger> if you call stuff without doing that it's unsafe
