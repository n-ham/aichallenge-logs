2012-01-07T08:09:11  <conor_f> I never understood what latex is, just a markup for math symbols?
2012-01-07T08:10:10  <mcstar> its a programming language
2012-01-07T08:10:29  <mcstar> like postscript
2012-01-07T08:10:48  <conor_f> weird
2012-01-07T08:10:51  <mcstar> the output is a formatted document
2012-01-07T08:11:03  <conor_f> I see I'm lagging well behing in PE lol
2012-01-07T08:12:26  <mcstar> those sites using "latex" dont really use latex, i believe, only a subset of it
2012-01-07T08:12:38  <mcstar> just to display math symbols like you said
2012-01-07T08:13:05  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-07T08:13:19  <conor_f> I never knew it could make vector graphics or anything lol
2012-01-07T08:13:43  <mcstar> i dont think it can by itself
2012-01-07T08:13:49  <mcstar> but you can draw with packages
2012-01-07T08:14:09  <conor_f> hmm kk
2012-01-07T08:14:26  <conor_f> did you ever play piano by any chance?
2012-01-07T08:14:58  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-07T08:15:00  <conor_f> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxu14FAUKV4
2012-01-07T08:15:08  <conor_f> then you can appreciate how hard that is
2012-01-07T08:15:20  <mcstar> and the teachers realized i shouldnt attend music school
2012-01-07T08:15:21  <conor_f> improv part starts around 1:00
2012-01-07T08:15:38  <conor_f> do you still play piano?
2012-01-07T08:16:14  <mcstar> as i implied, i never learnt it
2012-01-07T08:16:32  <conor_f> oh, see I thought you learnt it pretty well
2012-01-07T08:16:40  <mcstar> the opposite
2012-01-07T08:16:44  <conor_f> still though, that guys incredible
2012-01-07T08:17:02  <conor_f> I've been playing since I was like 9 but could never do that
2012-01-07T08:17:13  <conor_f> his timing is just ridiculous :O
2012-01-07T08:17:41  <antimatroid1> conor_f: it's worth learning LaTeX if you go into scienc
2012-01-07T08:18:07  <conor_f> antimatroid1: not looking at science :)
2012-01-07T08:18:16  <conor_f> software dev or something
2012-01-07T08:18:21  <conor_f> staying a good bit away from science
2012-01-07T08:18:23  <antimatroid1> it's the standard for academic papers etc. and just looks nicer
2012-01-07T08:18:29  <conor_f> but I suppose it's not that hard to learn
2012-01-07T08:18:31  <antimatroid1> still worth learning then
2012-01-07T08:18:53  <conor_f> probably only a day long thing to learn?
2012-01-07T08:18:54  <antimatroid1> once you are familiar with how LaTeX looks everything else looks gross
2012-01-07T08:19:56  <mcstar> it still takes time to do advanced layouts in it
2012-01-07T08:20:08  <mcstar> antimatroid1: did you do a big-ass poster in latex by any chance?
2012-01-07T08:20:12  <antimatroid1> yes, but to do assignments or whatever you don't need advanced layouts
2012-01-07T08:20:17  <antimatroid1> i did not
2012-01-07T08:20:27  <mcstar> it took pretty long for me
2012-01-07T08:20:59  <antimatroid1> i got the trinary triumph award on pe
2012-01-07T08:21:08  <conor_f> :) nice
2012-01-07T08:21:14  <mcstar> lame
2012-01-07T08:21:23  <mcstar> oh, sorry
2012-01-07T08:21:29  <mcstar> i didnt want to say it out load
2012-01-07T08:21:33  <conor_f> heh
2012-01-07T08:21:59  <antimatroid1> :P
2012-01-07T08:22:07  <mcstar> antimatroid1: youve got the most awards among my friends
2012-01-07T08:22:08  <conor_f> I need to try and catch rwest_
2012-01-07T08:22:13  <antimatroid1> same with me
2012-01-07T08:22:27  <antimatroid1> strcat and my other friend are tied on 70 problems solved
2012-01-07T08:22:28  <mcstar> rwest:
2012-01-07T08:22:44  <conor_f> but still his shabby morals make it easy for him to just use wolfram alpha :P
2012-01-07T08:22:45  <mcstar> antimatroid1: you should have added mcleo
2012-01-07T08:23:02  <antimatroid1> i will get his friend thing later
2012-01-07T08:23:19  <conor_f> I have mcleo, thestinger, antimatroid1, mcstar and rwest_ :P
2012-01-07T08:23:32  <antimatroid1> sigh would put us all to shame
2012-01-07T08:23:42  <antimatroid1> how many problems have McLeopold and rwest solved?
2012-01-07T08:23:48  <sigh> antimatroid1: what would I do?
2012-01-07T08:23:50  <mcstar> i only have 1 other friend, other than you guys
2012-01-07T08:23:55  <conor_f> McLeopold: 74
2012-01-07T08:23:57  <antimatroid1> sigh: put us to shame on project euler
2012-01-07T08:23:59  <conor_f> rwest 30 :P
2012-01-07T08:24:07  <antimatroid1> sigh: befriend me 87839112121588_5bb1270f8fa7b38e44fd06f20fd13ff3
2012-01-07T08:24:11  <sigh> oh I haven't done project euler for over a year
2012-01-07T08:24:12  <mcstar> sigh: wanna share friend key?
2012-01-07T08:24:18  <conor_f> doesn't sigh have like hundreds done?
2012-01-07T08:24:21  <antimatroid1> yeah the site is a bit different now
2012-01-07T08:24:33  <conor_f> changed a lot alright
2012-01-07T08:24:35  <sigh> sure, how do I do that... I haven't used it since for a while
2012-01-07T08:24:38  <conor_f> nicer now :)
2012-01-07T08:24:42  <antimatroid1> log in and go to friends
2012-01-07T08:24:47  <mcstar> just go to Friends, paste your key here
2012-01-07T08:24:47  <antimatroid1> then add the new friend key
2012-01-07T08:25:05  <conor_f> or better
2012-01-07T08:25:11  <conor_f> just paste your friend key
2012-01-07T08:25:12  <antimatroid1> these guys started hammering the problems out
2012-01-07T08:25:14  <sigh> my key is 6666134423868_029bce60358e4f2a72641d5c385e0ea0
2012-01-07T08:25:16  <antimatroid1> so i thought i better keep in front :P
2012-01-07T08:25:31  <mcstar> 257
2012-01-07T08:25:33  <conor_f> wow
2012-01-07T08:25:34  <antimatroid1> yikes
2012-01-07T08:25:37  <conor_f> thats ridiculous
2012-01-07T08:25:39  <conor_f> 10 awards
2012-01-07T08:25:43  <conor_f> *slow clap*
2012-01-07T08:25:53  <conor_f> lol 818 days ago :P
2012-01-07T08:25:54  <sigh> i was at a 100% for a while :P
2012-01-07T08:25:55  <mcstar> sigh: thanks for the motiavtion
2012-01-07T08:26:12  <antimatroid1> he's not quite 200 problems ahead!
2012-01-07T08:26:39  <mcstar> i need to write some script to automate the solutions...
2012-01-07T08:26:39  <conor_f> yeah, easily reachable antimatroid1 ;)
2012-01-07T08:26:53  <conor_f> sigh: all in PY?
2012-01-07T08:27:11  <sigh> a few in c when python was too slow or took too much memory
2012-01-07T08:27:19  <sigh> but mostly python
2012-01-07T08:27:25  <conor_f> wow
2012-01-07T08:27:28  <conor_f> impressive
2012-01-07T08:27:44  <conor_f> what happened to 257 and 258 man?!?
2012-01-07T08:27:48  <conor_f> letting us down :P
2012-01-07T08:28:03  <sigh> haha
2012-01-07T08:28:40  <sigh> yeah... around that time I fell behind then kind of stopped to have time to do other things :)
2012-01-07T08:34:01  <sigh> antimatroid1: why have you skipped 12? :P
2012-01-07T08:34:11  <antimatroid1> sigh: don't talk to me about 12 :P
2012-01-07T08:34:20  <antimatroid1> i haven't looked at it in ages, but i could never get it
2012-01-07T08:34:39  <antimatroid1> everytime i looked at it i got extremely frustrated with myself
2012-01-07T08:34:42  <conor_f> antimatroid1: have you still not gotten it?
2012-01-07T08:34:53  <conor_f> just so you know, even I've gotten that one ;)
2012-01-07T08:34:54  <antimatroid1> haven't looked at it recently
2012-01-07T08:34:58  <antimatroid1> yeah i know :P
2012-01-07T08:35:22  <conor_f> just find the first triangle number with more then 500 divisors?
2012-01-07T08:36:00  * antimatroid1 goes to try it
2012-01-07T08:36:09  <sigh> you don't need to do anything special at all
2012-01-07T08:36:21  <conor_f> my horribly unoptimized brute force runs in like 1 min
2012-01-07T08:38:23  <sigh> if you want to be faster, then don't find the actual divisors, just find the prime factors and you can count divisors from that
2012-01-07T08:38:40  <conor_f> oh?
2012-01-07T08:38:46  <conor_f> how so?
2012-01-07T08:39:37  <mcstar> 12 looks like i didnt write that code
2012-01-07T08:39:41  <mcstar> ofc thats impossible
2012-01-07T08:39:55  <sigh> if x = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then x has (a1+1)*(a2+1)*...*(an+1) divisors
2012-01-07T08:40:21  <conor_f> huh
2012-01-07T08:40:24  <conor_f> never knew that
2012-01-07T08:40:36  <conor_f> would it be that much faster though?
2012-01-07T08:40:36  <sigh> because for each divisor you have to pick have many of each prime factor you want to include
2012-01-07T08:40:47  <conor_f> maybe if you stored the first 500 primes or something
2012-01-07T08:41:05  <sigh> my python code runs in less than a second including factoring and has nothing precomputed
2012-01-07T08:41:13  <conor_f> ok
2012-01-07T08:41:17  <conor_f> so it is faster :P
2012-01-07T08:41:57  <conor_f> lol in the irish rankings
2012-01-07T08:42:04  <conor_f> 1=325+ solved
2012-01-07T08:42:10  <conor_f> 2=174 solved
2012-01-07T08:42:11  <conor_f> lol
2012-01-07T08:42:33  <sigh> :)
2012-01-07T08:43:04  <mcstar> my solution http://codepad.org/afpAEVEd
2012-01-07T08:43:10  <mcstar> i figured out the problem
2012-01-07T08:43:16  <mcstar> i have several folders
2012-01-07T08:43:27  <mcstar> for storing pe problems, for haskel, cpp, lisp
2012-01-07T08:43:35  <mcstar> and i did it in cl
2012-01-07T08:43:49  <mcstar> and i was checking the c++ version, and i didnt write that one :)
2012-01-07T08:43:52  <conor_f> hmm
2012-01-07T08:44:01  * conor_f wonders which problem to do next
2012-01-07T08:44:22  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!kvirc@46-133-33-2.dialup.umc.net.ua> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-07T08:44:36  <mcstar> it has a prime factorization in there thats why its so lomg
2012-01-07T08:44:38  <sigh> conor_f: mcstar's code uses the prime decomposition
2012-01-07T08:45:03  <conor_f> I wouldn't know, functional languages are ridiculous
2012-01-07T08:45:05  <conor_f> *to me
2012-01-07T08:45:18  <sigh> :)
2012-01-07T08:45:34  <mcstar> that code is fully imperative imho
2012-01-07T08:45:40  <sigh> I don't understand much of it either.... just looking at "n-of-divs (1+ v)"
2012-01-07T08:47:04  <sigh> well... I understand it by virtue of the fact that I know what it is computing :P
2012-01-07T08:47:59  <conor_f> http://codepad.org/hQPbP8vi
2012-01-07T08:48:07  <conor_f> mcstar: recursion ^^ :)
2012-01-07T08:48:22  <conor_f> I'm learning
2012-01-07T08:49:07  <mcstar> definitely
2012-01-07T08:49:22  <mcstar> just use 2 spaces instead of 8, pls
2012-01-07T08:49:33  <sigh> haha
2012-01-07T08:49:39  <conor_f> I would switch to 4 or 6
2012-01-07T08:49:47  <conor_f> but why does it matter to you? :P
2012-01-07T08:50:01  <mcstar> formatting matters
2012-01-07T08:50:06  <conor_f> isn't it obvious what belongs where lol
2012-01-07T08:50:10  <conor_f> and it's consistent
2012-01-07T08:50:10  <mcstar> my eye needs to travel too much
2012-01-07T08:50:15  <conor_f> sigh: opinions? :P
2012-01-07T08:50:35  <sigh> I use 2 or 4
2012-01-07T08:50:45  <sigh> At work I have to use 2
2012-01-07T08:50:50  <conor_f> why?
2012-01-07T08:50:54  <conor_f> 2 sounds awful...
2012-01-07T08:50:58  <sigh> I used to use 4 at home... but now I'm getting used to 2
2012-01-07T08:51:27  * antimatroid1 uses 4
2012-01-07T08:51:39  <mcstar> conor_f: do you need to copy the triangle vector-vector every time?
2012-01-07T08:51:43  <antimatroid1> sigh: how is work? ruling it like you own the place yet?
2012-01-07T08:51:52  <antimatroid1> i got phd funding for at utas :)
2012-01-07T08:52:14  <sigh> antimatroid1: going pretty well... I'm actually starting to be productive so that's good :P
2012-01-07T08:52:16  <conor_f> mcstar: yeah, I could just make it a global vector and just edit the same one but meh
2012-01-07T08:52:25  <sigh> antimatroid1: well done :)
2012-01-07T08:52:26  <mcstar> conor_f: no
2012-01-07T08:52:28  <mcstar> damn
2012-01-07T08:52:32  <conor_f> ?
2012-01-07T08:52:33  <mcstar> use pointers or references
2012-01-07T08:52:42  * conor_f gets sick
2012-01-07T08:52:50  <conor_f> pointer to a 2d vector
2012-01-07T08:53:01  <conor_f> my brain would shrivel up and die....
2012-01-07T08:53:07  <antimatroid1> why?
2012-01-07T08:53:14  <conor_f> reference would be ok I suppose
2012-01-07T08:53:17  <antimatroid1> abstract all the things
2012-01-07T08:53:24  <sigh> you can use a reference too... minimal code change: vector<vector<int> >& triangle
2012-01-07T08:53:31  <sigh> but you should try to get used to pointers
2012-01-07T08:53:36  <conor_f> antimatroid1: bad experience with C and passing 2d arrays to functions
2012-01-07T08:53:43  <sigh> it's not a hard concept, but it's important
2012-01-07T08:53:50  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-07T08:53:59  <conor_f> I understand them, just don't like using them
2012-01-07T08:54:01  <mcstar> you dont understand c if you dont understand pointers
2012-01-07T08:54:17  <mcstar> memory management, thats what c is
2012-01-07T08:54:21  <mcstar> nothing more
2012-01-07T08:54:34  <mcstar> c++ adds some typechecks over that, thats all
2012-01-07T08:54:58  <conor_f> mcstar: I do understand pointers mostly
2012-01-07T08:55:03  <conor_f> I just don't like them at all
2012-01-07T08:55:13  <mcstar> then start using them instead of thinking in globals
2012-01-07T08:56:16  <conor_f> yeah, suppose
2012-01-07T08:56:24  <conor_f> I really do see the time boost too
2012-01-07T08:56:43  <conor_f> 0.015s down to 0.006s by using references
2012-01-07T08:56:45  <mcstar> and memory use shrinks too
2012-01-07T08:57:02  <conor_f> by a huge amount considering its recursive
2012-01-07T08:57:10  <sigh> it becomes much more important in the longer running problems
2012-01-07T08:57:10  <mcstar> you are using the stack to allocate the arguments
2012-01-07T08:57:11  <antimatroid1> lol, it took AGES but my brute force 12 worked
2012-01-07T08:57:18  <mcstar> so you run ot of stack space much earlier
2012-01-07T08:57:22  <sigh> how long is ages?
2012-01-07T08:57:31  <antimatroid1> 570s :P
2012-01-07T08:57:46  <conor_f> :P
2012-01-07T08:57:47  <sigh> antimatroid1: do you know how to compute the number of divisors from the prime factorisation?
2012-01-07T08:58:00  <antimatroid1> i saw it and will look now
2012-01-07T08:58:10  <antimatroid1> i just let what i programmed up quickly run to see what'd happen
2012-01-07T08:58:11  <conor_f> antimatroid1: you can just find divisors up to its square root and multiply it by 2?
2012-01-07T08:58:15  <sigh> antimatroid1: you should be able to prove that result yourself :P
2012-01-07T08:58:15  <conor_f> I hope you did that :P
2012-01-07T08:58:35  <mcstar> a^n-1 * b^n-1 ...
2012-01-07T08:58:39  <antimatroid1> conor_f: yeah didn't notice until after it started running
2012-01-07T08:58:41  <antimatroid1> and just left it
2012-01-07T08:58:44  <conor_f> heh
2012-01-07T08:58:46  <antimatroid1> sigh's way is the right way anyway
2012-01-07T08:58:54  <conor_f> that would knock a decent chunk off ;)
2012-01-07T08:59:01  <conor_f> but yeah, sigh is right I imagine
2012-01-07T08:59:27  <conor_f> http://projecteuler.net/problem=21
2012-01-07T09:00:15  <conor_f> create a class and in it store the number, and the sum of its divisors
2012-01-07T09:00:33  <conor_f> and then check if they're amicable?
2012-01-07T09:00:46  <conor_f> or does that sound like a horrible way to do things
2012-01-07T09:00:47  <sigh> class seems like overkill
2012-01-07T09:00:52  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-07T09:00:54  <sigh> but sounds about right
2012-01-07T09:00:55  <conor_f> struct :P
2012-01-07T09:01:19  <sigh> don't need that
2012-01-07T09:01:25  <sigh> just store it in a map
2012-01-07T09:01:35  <sigh> or an array
2012-01-07T09:01:43  <sigh> sorry, map
2012-01-07T09:02:14  * conor_f shudders
2012-01-07T09:02:20  <antimatroid1> maps are really easy
2012-01-07T09:02:27  <mcstar> amic[n_] := With[{tmp = Total@Most@Divisors@n},If[tmp != n, If[Total@Most@Divisors@tmp == n, n, 0], 0]]
2012-01-07T09:02:28  <mcstar> Total@Table[amic[i], {i, 2, 9999}]
2012-01-07T09:02:33  <conor_f> nuh-uh antimatroid1
2012-01-07T09:02:40  <conor_f> I tried using them with ants
2012-01-07T09:02:45  <antimatroid1> #include <map> ... map<int, int> myMap; myMap[2] = 3; etc.
2012-01-07T09:03:00  <conor_f> hmm
2012-01-07T09:03:09  <sigh> oh miread the problem... an array or vector should be enough
2012-01-07T09:03:13  <conor_f> it sounds simple but my experience is yelling no :P
2012-01-07T09:03:14  <sigh> *misread
2012-01-07T09:03:14  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-07T09:03:25  <antimatroid1> just think of it like map<X, Y> f then it's like f:X->Y where you do f[x]
2012-01-07T09:03:32  <conor_f> a simple int array[1000][2] would do it
2012-01-07T09:03:51  <sigh> still too complicated :P
2012-01-07T09:03:58  <antimatroid1> i like that
2012-01-07T09:04:03  <antimatroid1> not needed for this problem
2012-01-07T09:04:07  <antimatroid1> but in general i like that syntax
2012-01-07T09:04:17  <sigh> conor_f: what are you storing in there?
2012-01-07T09:04:24  <conor_f> antimatroid1: I never thought of it that way
2012-01-07T09:04:36  <conor_f> sigh: the root number and the sum of it's divisors
2012-01-07T09:04:57  <conor_f> and 0 if the number of divisors is > 10000 or something
2012-01-07T09:05:00  <sigh> and using that, how will you find an amicable pair?
2012-01-07T09:05:26  <conor_f> search through it all ;)
2012-01-07T09:05:27  <conor_f> lol
2012-01-07T09:05:50  <conor_f> why is there no data type like perl hashes in C++? :@
2012-01-07T09:06:09  <sigh> like if you know that d(220) = 284 - like in the example - how will you check that it is a valdi pair?
2012-01-07T09:06:16  <sigh> map is close enough conor_f
2012-01-07T09:06:20  <sigh> to a perl hash
2012-01-07T09:06:30  <conor_f> not close enough :P
2012-01-07T09:06:46  <conor_f> 1 for loop should do it
2012-01-07T09:06:48  <sigh> what is missing? auto-vivification? :P
2012-01-07T09:06:59  <sigh> loop over all the values?
2012-01-07T09:07:05  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-07T09:07:09  <antimatroid1> iterators
2012-01-07T09:07:15  <antimatroid1> for the later
2012-01-07T09:07:25  <conor_f> oh
2012-01-07T09:07:36  <conor_f> no, I thought I had a good idea :P
2012-01-07T09:07:40  <conor_f> I don't though
2012-01-07T09:07:45  <sigh> conor_f: wouldn't it be much easier if you could look up the value of d(284) without looping over everything?
2012-01-07T09:08:01  <conor_f> yes, it sure would
2012-01-07T09:08:07  <conor_f> like a hash in perl :P
2012-01-07T09:08:22  <conor_f> search for key/value simply
2012-01-07T09:08:30  <sigh> yup, a map will do that too :)
2012-01-07T09:08:38  <sigh> but here... you can do that with an array
2012-01-07T09:08:58  <sigh> just use int array[1001]
2012-01-07T09:09:15  <sigh> then the index into the array can be the number you are searching for
2012-01-07T09:09:22  <antimatroid1> is it easy to initialise an array to a constant value?
2012-01-07T09:09:41  <antimatroid1> i've always just found vectors easier, like vector<bool> prime(10000, 1);
2012-01-07T09:09:43  <conor_f> antimatroid1: yes
2012-01-07T09:09:54  <conor_f> array[x] = {0}
2012-01-07T09:09:57  <conor_f> *;
2012-01-07T09:10:07  <antimatroid1> or vector<vector<bool> >(200, vector<bool>(200, 0)); etc.
2012-01-07T09:10:08  <conor_f> sigh: >_<
2012-01-07T09:10:10  <conor_f> yes
2012-01-07T09:10:26  <sigh> antimatroid1: interchange vector and array as appropriate in my explanations... I'm not really worring about the details here :P
2012-01-07T09:10:26  <conor_f> thats what I meant :P
2012-01-07T09:10:42  <antimatroid1> i was asking for my own sake
2012-01-07T09:10:58  <conor_f> I g2g now
2012-01-07T09:11:01  <conor_f> ty sigh
2012-01-07T09:11:02  <conor_f> ttyl
2012-01-07T09:11:07  <sigh> cya
2012-01-07T09:11:09  <antimatroid1> like can you do bool thing[200][200]; initialised to 1 somehow?
2012-01-07T09:12:09  <sigh> antimatroid1: hmmm... not sure
2012-01-07T09:12:51  <antimatroid1> i pretty much abuse the hell out of vectors because i can initialise them to any constant value in one line for any number of dimensions
2012-01-07T09:13:10  <sigh> yeah
2012-01-07T09:15:44  <mcstar> for(int i=0; i<200; i++) for(int j=0; j<200; j++) thing[i][j]=true;
2012-01-07T09:16:40  <mcstar> #30 solved
2012-01-07T09:18:00  <mcstar> btw, on a sidenote, contructors are typically used for initialization
2012-01-07T09:18:19  <mcstar> so its a moot argument saying in a fully oo language you "cant" initialize something
2012-01-07T09:18:52  <sigh> by that argument c++ isn't "fully oo" :P
2012-01-07T09:19:27  <mcstar> why?
2012-01-07T09:19:42  <mcstar> arrays come from C
2012-01-07T09:20:17  <mcstar> just write a damn wrapper around them , make your class and be happy with it
2012-01-07T09:20:23  <mcstar> or use the c++ array class
2012-01-07T09:20:26  <sigh> haha
2012-01-07T09:20:27  <mcstar> or whatever
2012-01-07T09:20:45  <sigh> that's why antimatroid1 was using vector :)
2012-01-07T09:21:06  <mcstar> but a vector of vectors is lame in my eyes
2012-01-07T09:21:11  <antimatroid1> why?
2012-01-07T09:21:20  <mcstar> id only use that if the length of rows are not the same
2012-01-07T09:21:29  <mcstar> or i dont have time to use something else
2012-01-07T09:21:41  <antimatroid1> i'm a lazy typist
2012-01-07T09:21:49  <antimatroid1> and like minimal lines
2012-01-07T09:22:18  <mcstar> antimatroid1: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array
2012-01-07T09:22:24  <mcstar> it has a fill funtion
2012-01-07T09:22:55  <antimatroid1> that's 2 lines
2012-01-07T09:23:07  <mcstar> thats why i said do your 2d array
2012-01-07T09:23:12  <mcstar> you only need to write it once
2012-01-07T09:23:22  <mcstar> i did one for Ants
2012-01-07T09:23:40  <antimatroid1> meh, vector <3
2012-01-07T09:24:15  <mcstar> oh
2012-01-07T09:24:40  <mcstar> im sure you can concoct some kind of macro do initilize an array(and define it)
2012-01-07T09:24:55  <mcstar> to*
2012-01-07T09:25:02  <UncleVasya> memset(my_array, 1, sizeof(my_array))?

2012-01-07T09:39:08  <mcstar> antimatroid1: i dont understand your 1st question
2012-01-07T09:39:34  <antimatroid1> #define array2d(type, name, rows, cols, init) **type** name[rows][cols];
2012-01-07T09:39:39  <antimatroid1> array2d(bool, boolAr, 10, 10, true)  ****   boolAr[0][0]=false;

2012-01-07T09:40:01  <antimatroid1> it's late :P
2012-01-07T09:40:13  <mcstar> ok :)
2012-01-07T09:40:28  <mcstar> you can have arraynd if you write it
2012-01-07T09:40:35  <mcstar> for n=3,4,5, ...
2012-01-07T09:40:47  <mcstar> a general one, im not sure if possible with macros
2012-01-07T09:40:50  <mcstar> maybe it is
2012-01-07T09:41:13  <mcstar> with some kind of clever recursive text substitution
2012-01-07T09:41:30  <mcstar> the proper solution ofc would be to use some templated class

2012-01-07T12:18:55  <conor_f> no, 21 :P
2012-01-07T12:19:22  <mcstar> i mean try that now
2012-01-07T12:20:09  <conor_f> oh
2012-01-07T12:20:11  <conor_f> ok
2012-01-07T12:20:15  <conor_f> let me see first
2012-01-07T12:20:48  <conor_f> oh
2012-01-07T12:20:51  <conor_f> this is just math
2012-01-07T12:20:56  <conor_f> I think....
2012-01-07T12:21:22  <conor_f> bleh, brute force :p
2012-01-07T12:22:18  <mcstar> my first approach took 17minutes
2012-01-07T12:22:23  <mcstar> the next one 200ms
2012-01-07T12:22:37  <conor_f> lol
2012-01-07T12:22:40  <mcstar> basically, i wrote the second one while the first one run
2012-01-07T12:22:47  <conor_f> brute force vs. smart way?
2012-01-07T12:22:54  <mcstar> i recommend that for you, because i want to show my solutiojn
2012-01-07T12:22:59  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-07T12:23:06  <conor_f> kk
2012-01-07T12:23:14  <mcstar> it is very short, and has a fine recursion in it
2012-01-07T12:23:21  <mcstar> but you WILL understand

2012-01-07T12:36:17  <mcstar> how many?

2012-01-07T12:43:49  <conor_f> oh
2012-01-07T12:43:54  <mcstar> so, no i dont use pascals triangle

2012-01-07T12:44:02  <conor_f> kk
2012-01-07T12:44:11  <conor_f> I just noticed
2012-01-07T12:44:16  <conor_f> 1p = 1 way
2012-01-07T12:44:19  <conor_f> 2 = 2

2012-01-07T12:44:51  <conor_f> 6=10 (I think :P)
2012-01-07T12:44:54  <mcstar> these equations dont hold
2012-01-07T12:45:06  <conor_f> and that follows down along the triangle
2012-01-07T12:45:21  <conor_f> not in a straight line, but in a zig-zag lol
2012-01-07T12:46:05  <conor_f> either way, I know theres a way you can do it smartly by working upwards instead of downwards
2012-01-07T12:46:26  <conor_f> (instead of recursion where you take away from 200)
2012-01-07T12:46:43  <conor_f> you should be able to go up in a sequence I imagine....

2012-01-07T13:11:36  <conor_f> this is the brute force one?
2012-01-07T13:11:55  <conor_f> I think it's the 'i' thats confusing me....
2012-01-07T13:12:18  <mcstar> this is not the brute force
2012-01-07T13:12:35  <conor_f> so the i is very important
2012-01-07T13:12:38  <mcstar> the brute force is the loop over every count of all the coints, and testing for 200

2012-01-07T13:16:35  <conor_f> so why does it work?
2012-01-07T13:16:42  <mcstar> the pattern is clearer than in the c verison
2012-01-07T13:17:09  <mcstar> solve 0 _ = 1
2012-01-07T13:17:22  <mcstar> obviously if the sum is 0, you have a solution
2012-01-07T13:17:32  <mcstar> thats 1 in the recursive sum
2012-01-07T13:17:37  <mcstar> solve _ [] = 0
2012-01-07T13:17:54  <mcstar> if there are no more coins, and the sum didnt reach 0, you have to get back with 0
2012-01-07T13:17:58  <mcstar> i.e. no solution
2012-01-07T13:18:02  <mcstar> clear?
2012-01-07T13:18:26  <conor_f> no
2012-01-07T13:18:29  <mcstar> in the haskell version, i take the list apart, which holds the coins
2012-01-07T13:18:30  <conor_f> well
2012-01-07T13:18:32  <conor_f> sort of
2012-01-07T13:18:37  <mcstar> its like the i index in c++
2012-01-07T13:18:41  <conor_f> still annoyed I couldn't do it :@
2012-01-07T13:18:56  <mcstar> solve s coins@(c:cs) = if (s-c)<0 then solve s cs  else (solve (s-c) coins) + (solve s cs)
2012-01-07T13:19:04  <mcstar> this is the general case
2012-01-07T13:19:11  <mcstar> (s-c)<0
2012-01-07T13:19:23  <mcstar> this means, you are subtracting the current coin from the sum
2012-01-07T13:19:31  <mcstar> and since if this is <0, you dont want it
2012-01-07T13:19:37  <mcstar> -if
2012-01-07T13:19:51  <mcstar> so you call solve, with the SAME amount, as before
2012-01-07T13:20:05  <mcstar> but, you took the "wrong" coin off the list
2012-01-07T13:20:19  <mcstar> if s-c not < 0
2012-01-07T13:20:19  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-07T13:20:20  <conor_f> bleh
2012-01-07T13:20:27  <mcstar> you call the sum of 2 recursive calls
2012-01-07T13:20:46  <mcstar> in the first you go with the same coin, and subtract its value from the sum
2012-01-07T13:21:00  <mcstar> in the other you go with the other coins, and dont subtract from the sum

2012-01-07T13:38:52  <mcstar> yes?
2012-01-07T13:39:41  <mcstar> that loop is not necessary
2012-01-07T13:39:56  <mcstar> thats why we do recursion

2012-01-07T13:40:18  <conor_f> its nice code though
2012-01-07T13:40:26  <mcstar> no
2012-01-07T13:40:35  <mcstar> what i wrote in c++ for you is nicer
2012-01-07T13:40:42  <mcstar> ofc the haskell is the best
2012-01-07T13:40:56  <mleise> I found an interesting new GPL file compressor called PAQ
2012-01-07T13:41:11  <mcstar> conor_f: page 8, br3ndanf in f#
2012-01-07T13:41:11  <conor_f> oh?
2012-01-07T13:41:20  <mcstar> that code is basically the same as my haskell one
2012-01-07T13:41:22  <conor_f> no, I will cry
2012-01-07T13:41:24  <mleise> Especially the PAQ8 series is extremely slow and has a high compression ratio.

2012-01-07T13:41:42  <conor_f> *shudder*

2012-01-07T13:42:21  <mcstar> anyway, you seem like you didnt read my pasted c++ code
2012-01-07T13:42:33  <conor_f> although I promised myself I'd go to bed before 00:00 so I will get back in the rhythm for school
2012-01-07T13:42:39  <conor_f> mcstar: I did....
2012-01-07T13:42:46  <conor_f> oh, joke :P
2012-01-07T13:42:47  <mcstar> i mean why does exomo loop, if he used also recursion?
2012-01-07T13:42:47  <conor_f> get it
2012-01-07T13:42:58  <mcstar> and you say his solution is nice?
2012-01-07T13:43:03  <mcstar> im offended
2012-01-07T13:43:25  <mcstar> conor_f: yes, dont stay awake so long in the night
2012-01-07T13:43:33  <mcstar> its a VERY bad habit
2012-01-07T13:43:44  <mcstar> (i suffer from it)
2012-01-07T13:44:01  <mcstar> (i mean, i suffer from that i cant go to sleep early)
2012-01-07T13:44:07  <conor_f> I've been awake until after 02:00 for the last 2 weeks
2012-01-07T13:44:16  <conor_f> I'm actually becoming nocturnal...
2012-01-07T13:44:27  <mcstar> change while you can
2012-01-07T13:44:34  <conor_f> now school starts again on monday and that means getting up 4 hours earlier then normally
2012-01-07T13:45:03  <mleise> FP8 is a somewhat sped-up version of PAQ8 that can compress with 2MB/minute! amazing, ain't it?
2012-01-07T13:45:30  <conor_f> mcstar: I said his code was nice because it blended what me and you were doing together

2012-01-07T13:49:52  <mleise> lol, it looks like some government members slip into a new nationalism. thats bad especially in the context of the eu
2012-01-07T13:51:27  <mcstar> conor_f: dont take that too seriously, i just think it isnt nice to combine the 2 approaches
2012-01-07T13:51:36  <mleise> but I guess, you are not completely ignorant when you would prefer foreign news papers ;)
2012-01-07T13:51:58  <mcstar> conor_f: but, there are some horrible codes on the forum, so that one was among the nicests

2012-01-07T13:53:12  <mcstar> mleise: i wonder how other nations view this little political shithole of ours
2012-01-07T13:53:32  <mcstar> and they probably takes sides with reason, not because of prejudice

2012-01-07T13:57:23  <mcstar> 31
2012-01-07T13:57:39  <mcstar> i dont map, i instead recurse too
2012-01-07T13:58:21  <thestinger> oh, I made a n_partitions function
2012-01-07T13:58:25  <thestinger> because there are a bunch of those
2012-01-07T13:58:37  <thestinger> you can do it with dynamic programming
2012-01-07T13:58:55  <thestinger> took me a while to get it fast enough for one of the later ones though
2012-01-07T13:59:33  <mcstar> i still dont get why people say DP DP DP
2012-01-07T13:59:48  <mcstar> go and buy a pron flick and you get DP
2012-01-07T13:59:57  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-07T14:00:19  <thestinger> well, you keep the results from the last calculation in an array and just move closer to what you actually want
2012-01-07T14:00:33  <thestinger> sec, I did it in Go
2012-01-07T14:00:39  <thestinger> have to port it to C++
2012-01-07T14:00:44  <mcstar> why?
2012-01-07T14:00:55  <mcstar> you broke your go compiler?

2012-01-07T14:12:25  <mcstar> that emulates the recursive pattern wo function calls
2012-01-07T14:12:43  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-07T14:13:23  <thestinger> iirc, there are a few more partition problems
2012-01-07T14:13:29  <thestinger> I made this because it needed to be a lot faster
2012-01-07T14:13:47  <thestinger> not sure if I ended up actually doing the other problems, I don't think so
2012-01-07T14:14:28  <mcstar> i should make some kind of collection of these useful snippets myself
2012-01-07T14:15:07  <thestinger> yeah, I started putting them in a C++ header
2012-01-07T14:15:13  <thestinger> need to make this generic and I'll stick it in there too
2012-01-07T14:18:35  <thestinger> might as well leave the calloc/free
2012-01-07T14:20:11  <mcstar> my problem is that i used 5 different languages for these problems so far
2012-01-07T14:20:32  <thestinger> I used python for almost all of them, C++ for some and haskell for a few
2012-01-07T14:20:48  <mcstar> c++,cl,haskell,mathematica,python
2012-01-07T14:20:54  <thestinger> when I was doing it before I ended up doing some in C and Go though

2012-01-07T14:29:17  <thestinger> from the prime factors?
2012-01-07T14:29:29  <thestinger> or fermat's factorization method, etc.
2012-01-07T14:29:55  <thestinger> there are a few questions which I could solve if I could only factor a bit faster...
2012-01-07T14:30:01  <thestinger> maybe python is a bad choice for those
2012-01-07T14:30:13  <mcstar> when i factored i factored by sieve
2012-01-07T14:30:20  <mcstar> if thats why you ask
2012-01-07T14:30:23  <mcstar> what*
2012-01-07T14:30:49  <mcstar> and it is supposed to fast afaik for small numebrs
2012-01-07T14:31:01  <mcstar> or
2012-01-07T14:31:03  <mcstar> or
2012-01-07T14:31:20  <mcstar> theres some method i that is "probabilisitc"
2012-01-07T14:31:25  <mcstar> i dont recall its name
2012-01-07T14:31:34  <mcstar> but it has a minimal chance of being wrong
2012-01-07T14:32:03  <mcstar> probably i should program that
2012-01-07T14:32:19  <mcstar> ive found some haskell module that uses it

2012-01-07T14:33:17  <mleise> Ah... I think what I need for my card game is called "hypergeometric distribution"
2012-01-07T14:33:24  <thestinger> I think you can just run it enough times that the chance it will be wrong is lower than the chance that your memory will be corrupted by a solar flare :P
2012-01-07T14:35:20  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/BFzIGcq64BQl9GTmrOef/ I was just getting prime factors like that
2012-01-07T14:35:25  <thestinger> and then getting the factors from it
2012-01-07T14:35:27  <thestinger> but it's too slow
2012-01-07T14:36:43  <thestinger> even in C++ :(
2012-01-07T14:36:49  <mcstar> thats mine http://codepad.org/jWZ2vp8k
2012-01-07T14:37:43  <mcstar> it was fast up to 2^1[1-2]0-1
2012-01-07T14:37:55  <mcstar> or some like that, i was some time ago
2012-01-07T14:37:58  <mcstar> it*
2012-01-07T14:38:29  <thestinger> well, maybe my problem is the prime factors -> divisors part
2012-01-07T14:38:58  <thestinger> I should make my sieve an array.array in python or use numpy, but it's fast
2012-01-07T14:39:46  <mcstar> thestinger: found this site yesterday, itll improve my haskell i think http://www.polyomino.f2s.com/david/haskell/codeindex.html

2012-01-07T14:40:53  <mleise> "I was just getting prime factors like that and then getting the factors from it"  ??? You cannot factorize primes -.
2012-01-07T14:41:20  <thestinger> well, you can get the divisors of a number from the prime factors
2012-01-07T14:41:50  <mcstar> mleise: youre misunderstanding what he said
2012-01-07T14:41:52  <thestinger> there are obviously better ways than what I was doing
2012-01-07T14:41:58  <mcstar> of course you cant factorize prime numbers

2012-01-07T15:17:31  <conor_f> I can taste the recursion
2012-01-07T15:17:47  <mcstar> its a messy problem
2012-01-07T15:17:51  <conor_f> checking for syntatic correctness, permutations, coin tosses
2012-01-07T15:17:53  <mcstar> and stinks like works

2012-01-07T15:18:08  <conor_f> I'm saying in the algorithmic category
2012-01-07T15:18:20  <mcstar> oh
2012-01-07T15:18:59  <mcstar> is this what mleise was talking about?
2012-01-07T15:19:13  <mcstar> the card shuffling problem
2012-01-07T15:19:18  <conor_f> I don't know
2012-01-07T15:19:24  <conor_f> no, this is on codesprint :P
2012-01-07T15:21:16  <mleise> i had recursions before I found out about hypergeometric distribution. combinatorics ftw
2012-01-07T15:23:14  <mcstar> mleise: are you solving a codesprint problem?
2012-01-07T15:23:37  <mleise> now i just build lookup tables for everything I could ever need in the real of combinatorics (binominal, n! ...)
2012-01-07T15:23:53  <mleise> mcstar: now, a family card game problem

2012-01-07T15:24:38  <conor_f> I want to learn some math. What should I look at?
2012-01-07T15:24:51  <mleise> conor_f: combinatorics of course :p
2012-01-07T15:25:18  <conor_f> I know basic algebra, Triginomety, kinematics, projectiles, a few other physics/maths topics
2012-01-07T15:25:20  <mleise> it is super useful to find out that some brute force algorithms wont work
2012-01-07T15:25:28  <conor_f> combinatorics?
2012-01-07T15:25:31  <conor_f> kk
2012-01-07T15:26:33  <cyphase> conor_f, take a look at khan academy for calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. http://www.khanacademy.org/
2012-01-07T15:26:34  <mleise> conor_f: you wrote about coin tosses and permutations, so I guessed you want to learn how to solve these with simple formulas
2012-01-07T15:27:11  <conor_f> mleise: that is also true
2012-01-07T15:27:15  <conor_f> ok
2012-01-07T15:27:37  <conor_f> khan academy for everything
2012-01-07T15:27:47  <conor_f> ty cyphase and mleise
2012-01-07T15:28:06  <cyphase> conor_f, it's good stuff if you haven't seen it. also lots of physics and other physical sciences
2012-01-07T15:28:09  <cyphase> conor_f, np :)
2012-01-07T15:28:18  <conor_f> I've seen it before
2012-01-07T15:28:23  <conor_f> forgotten about it though :P
2012-01-07T15:29:07  <conor_f> bleh
2012-01-07T15:29:26  <conor_f> I've got to summarize 4 acts of hamlet by tomorrow -_-
2012-01-07T15:29:36  <conor_f> and do wedges in applied maths
2012-01-07T15:30:06  <conor_f> actually, does anyone here know applied maths/physics and maths/applied physics? (Different names in different places)
2012-01-07T15:30:26  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-07T15:30:37  <cyphase> conor_f, take a look at #math too
2012-01-07T15:30:50  <conor_f> yeah, #math were nice to me before :) :P
2012-01-07T15:31:04  <conor_f> mcstar: mind answering a few questions or will I just go to #math?
2012-01-07T15:31:20  <mcstar> ask
2012-01-07T15:32:32  <conor_f> it's to do with forces and wedges (an inclined plane free to move)
2012-01-07T15:32:48  <mcstar> thats easy
2012-01-07T15:32:53  <conor_f> it's simple really, but I can't get the basic equations >_<
2012-01-07T15:32:56  <conor_f> yeah, I know
2012-01-07T15:33:24  <conor_f> I can't get the equations though
2012-01-07T15:33:34  <conor_f> I don't know which way to resolve the vectors :/
2012-01-07T15:33:51  <mcstar> this stupid problem description for this card shuffling stuff is extremely badly formulated
2012-01-07T15:33:58  <conor_f> so just the most basic idea

2012-01-07T15:34:48  <conor_f> what do I do with the wedge? Do I have to split it's acceleration vector into components?
2012-01-07T15:36:19  <mcstar> so you have a wedge, that can travel on a plane, and a point-mass on it
2012-01-07T15:36:28  <conor_f> yes
2012-01-07T15:37:44  <conor_f> do you want to know the question as in from the book?
2012-01-07T15:37:59  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-07T15:39:24  <conor_f> A wedge of mass 3m rests on a smooth horizontal table with one of its plane faces inclined at an angle 30 degrees to the horizontal. A particle of mass m is placed on this face which is smooth and the system is released from rest. show on separate diagrams the forces acting on the particle and the wedge
2012-01-07T15:40:25  <conor_f> By considering the forces and acceleratoins of the particle in two directions: the first along the plane and the other perpendicular to the plane, find the acceleration, a, of the wedge and the acceleration, f, of the particle relative to the wedge

2012-01-07T15:58:11  <mcstar> conor_f: did you try writing down force balance, and equations of motion first?
2012-01-07T15:58:24  <conor_f> yes
2012-01-07T15:59:01  <conor_f> I think I have all the equations for motion but I know I need to do something with the wedges acceleration but I haven't done anything with it

2012-01-07T16:01:24  <mcstar> did you use the constraint on the components of acceleration of the wedge?
2012-01-07T16:02:29  <conor_f> as in f=ma perpindicular to the wedge for the masses acceleration?
2012-01-07T16:02:31  <conor_f> yes
2012-01-07T16:03:14  <conor_f> because it's not stationary, it is accelerating in the x and y axes
2012-01-07T16:03:21  <mcstar> no i mean ax=tan(alpha)ay
2012-01-07T16:03:40  <mcstar> (where x in parallel to the wedge's surface)
2012-01-07T16:03:46  <mcstar> y is perpendicular to that
2012-01-07T16:04:12  <conor_f> no
2012-01-07T16:04:49  <conor_f> the equations I have are mgSing30=m(b-a)

2012-01-07T16:05:33  <conor_f> and rCos60=2ma
2012-01-07T16:05:40  <conor_f> *and R=4ma

2012-01-07T16:06:44  <mcstar> what is R?
2012-01-07T16:07:11  <jcdjcd> Awesome
2012-01-07T16:07:11  <conor_f> the force acting on the wedge due to the mass
2012-01-07T16:07:21  <conor_f> perpindicular to the slope
2012-01-07T16:07:24  <conor_f> jcdjcd: ?
2012-01-07T16:07:50  <jcdjcd> I do a lot of R programming :)
2012-01-07T16:10:30  <conor_f> mcstar: I have about 10 pages front and back filled with my attempts for that problem -_-

2012-01-07T16:22:55  <mcstar> ah yes
2012-01-07T16:23:18  <conor_f> heh :P
2012-01-07T16:23:29  <mcstar> so the equation for the point mass projected on the wedge, shows that only gravity accelerates it in that direction
2012-01-07T16:24:02  <conor_f> bleh
2012-01-07T16:24:08  <mcstar> lets call that x direction
2012-01-07T16:24:18  <mcstar> in the other one, you have to forces
2012-01-07T16:24:30  <conor_f> *two
2012-01-07T16:24:34  <mcstar> one is the projection of gravity to y
2012-01-07T16:24:37  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-07T16:24:54  <mcstar> the other one is the force that pushes the masss
2012-01-07T16:24:58  <mcstar> what do you call it
2012-01-07T16:25:02  <mcstar> tartoero
2012-01-07T16:25:08  <mcstar> holding-force?
2012-01-07T16:25:15  <conor_f> no
2012-01-07T16:25:35  <conor_f> resistive force of the wedge on the mass?
2012-01-07T16:25:47  <mcstar> maybe
2012-01-07T16:26:13  <mcstar> thats the force, that is the projection of the wedge's horizontal acceleration to y
2012-01-07T16:26:24  <conor_f> yesa
2012-01-07T16:26:27  <conor_f> *yes
2012-01-07T16:27:40  <mcstar> you have to incorporate the condition that the point mass never leaves the surface of the wedge
2012-01-07T16:28:20  <mcstar> i.e. these accelerations are geometrically connected
2012-01-07T16:28:29  <conor_f> o.O

2012-01-07T17:14:15  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/LAXA there's a sample page
2012-01-07T17:15:07  <mcstar> wifi?
2012-01-07T17:15:28  <mcstar> hm
2012-01-07T17:15:33  <mcstar> i should read it from the start
2012-01-07T17:16:00  <thestinger> well, that's the wireless status page
2012-01-07T17:16:29  <thestinger> almost all the pages have the same source code but with more stuff added
2012-01-07T17:16:32  <mcstar> thestinger: my opinion is that it is totally unfuckingbelievable that people mix html and javascript
2012-01-07T17:16:45  <thestinger> this is basically the template they build up from (this page has no interactive buttons)
2012-01-07T17:17:11  <mcstar> must be suck to write web pages like this
2012-01-07T17:17:16  <CowTipperVirus> @later tell janzert Can we talk in a private channel for a bit?  I saw your response about not returning stderr, but I don't think it's returning game engine outputs either.
2012-01-07T17:17:16  <contestbot> CowTipperVirus: As you wish.

2012-01-07T17:18:10  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/iLCO there's the page with that awful 4 line if condition, lol
2012-01-07T17:21:14  <mcstar> now i understand the reason you use sprunge
2012-01-07T17:26:45  <mcstar> haha my one liner for #32 is slowly spitting out results
2012-01-07T17:27:00  <mcstar> after 25mins rentime
2012-01-07T17:27:33  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-07T17:35:51  <mcstar> its correct
2012-01-07T17:36:05  <mcstar> almost 40 minutes
2012-01-07T17:36:14  <mcstar> i wasted soo much power...

2012-01-07T17:36:59  <mcstar> sorry, i couldnt help myself
2012-01-07T17:37:53  <thestinger> I'm going to try 46 now
2012-01-07T17:38:01  <mleise> i need python, my programming language silently overflows when I compute 21!
2012-01-07T17:38:38  <thestinger> mleise: which language?
2012-01-07T17:38:43  <thestinger> you can use gmp in almost any language
2012-01-07T17:38:44  <mcstar> D
2012-01-07T17:38:52  <mleise> ^ that
2012-01-07T17:39:03  <thestinger> gmp is awful in C though
2012-01-07T17:39:16  <mcstar> thestinger: dont use it with c
2012-01-07T17:39:20  <mcstar> :D
2012-01-07T17:39:51  <mleise> i prefer to be close to the silicon, so i rather spend hours debugging this and coming up with solutions that skip large intermediate results

2012-01-07T18:50:44  <thestinger> I just do it like that
2012-01-07T18:51:32  <thestinger> lru_cache is actually a built-in, and you can turn on the lru part

2012-01-07T21:37:58  <antimatroid1> presumably one sorts the cards by number, then just checks for each type of hand in order?
2012-01-07T21:38:11  <thestinger> why sort them?
2012-01-07T21:38:18  <thestinger> I'm turning each hand into a lookup table basically
2012-01-07T21:38:23  <thestinger> {2: {'D'}, 'D': {2, 12}, 'H': {11}, 11: {'H', 'S'}, 12: {'D'}, 'C': {14}, 14: {'C'}, 'S': {11}}
2012-01-07T21:38:25  <antimatroid1> ah fair enough
2012-01-07T21:38:53  <thestinger> so there's a 2, suit is diamonds
2012-01-07T21:38:58  <thestinger> there are 2 diamonds - 2 and 12
2012-01-07T21:39:00  <thestinger> etc.
2012-01-07T21:39:50  <thestinger> anyway a hand is just a dict, with suits and numbers as keys and sets of the opposite as values
2012-01-07T21:39:58  <thestinger> seems to be a good way to do it
2012-01-07T21:40:59  <thestinger> {2: {'H'}, 4: {'H'}, 6: {'H'}, 8: {'H'}, 'H': {8, 2, 4, 13, 6}, 13: {'H'}}
2012-01-07T21:41:00  <thestinger> {'C': {9, 2, 4, 5, 7}, 4: {'C'}, 5: {'C'}, 7: {'C'}, 9: {'C'}, 2: {'C'}}
2012-01-07T21:41:02  <thestinger> those are both a flush
2012-01-07T21:41:14  <thestinger> since they didn't match my other broken things
2012-01-07T21:41:15  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-07T21:41:19  <thestinger> not working yet...
2012-01-07T21:47:51  <mleise> :D you play cards now?
2012-01-07T21:48:40  <thestinger> euler question :P
2012-01-07T21:48:50  <thestinger> http://projecteuler.net/problem=54
2012-01-07T21:49:05  <thestinger> ok, maybe there are no royal flushes in the data...
2012-01-07T21:49:10  <thestinger> I didn't consider that
2012-01-07T21:49:22  <mleise> antimatroid1: lets write a card game AI that solves a game
2012-01-07T21:49:36  <antimatroid1> mleise: which game?
2012-01-07T21:49:40  <thestinger> I don't get a single match for royal flush, straight flush or four of a kind
2012-01-07T21:50:02  <thestinger> 2 matches for full house and they are accurate
2012-01-07T21:50:22  <antimatroid1> i need to look into how to set up tcp servers
2012-01-07T21:50:31  <antimatroid1> then we could just make a bunch of games to play around with ai for
2012-01-07T21:52:03  <mleise> antimatroid1: the next gen euler then
2012-01-07T21:52:20  <antimatroid1> that's always been the plan
2012-01-07T21:52:24  <antimatroid1> like project euler but for ai
2012-01-07T21:52:30  <mleise> instead of solving problems for yourself, your programs play against each other
2012-01-07T21:52:33  <antimatroid1> with new "problems" being contests
2012-01-07T21:53:02  <mleise> antimatroid1: I'm working on a version of Asshole with 32 cards
2012-01-07T21:53:03  <antimatroid1> anyone know where i'd begin to learn about tcp stuff?
2012-01-07T21:53:12  <antimatroid1> i guess just grab a copy of the ants tcp and work out wtf is going on
2012-01-07T21:53:39  <mleise> antimatroid1: Ants TCP uses library stuff from Python.
2012-01-07T21:54:04  <antimatroid1> i was thinking about this the other day
2012-01-07T21:54:19  <antimatroid1> with multiple games, could that all run through the same port?
2012-01-07T21:54:21  <mleise> Every major language Python, Delphi, Java etc. has ready to use TCP Server/Client classes
2012-01-07T21:54:38  <mleise> antimatroid1: There is one listen port (80 for HTTP)
2012-01-07T21:54:51  <antimatroid1> like the bot would give info to the server about what it wants, ie. game, number of players, map, etc. then you have to try and match up games based on people saying what they wanted
2012-01-07T21:54:54  <mleise> then a new socket is created for the actual connection
2012-01-07T21:55:20  <mleise> so the "listener" is in one thread on port 80 and the connections are handled in other threads
2012-01-07T21:57:04  <antimatroid1> how do you run a tcp server?
2012-01-07T21:57:14  <antimatroid1> like does it need to run on a server, or could i run one from my pc?
2012-01-07T21:57:30  <mleise> antimatroid1: maybe a client software could handle the situation where noone is online and organize a game with two of your programs playing against each other
2012-01-07T21:57:47  <mleise> antimatroid1: you can run it on your pc
2012-01-07T21:57:47  <thestinger> antimatroid1: you just run it anywhere, but you need the port forwarded if you're behind an NAT
2012-01-07T21:58:05  <antimatroid1> yeah forwarding ports is easy
2012-01-07T21:58:18  <antimatroid1> i'm going to spend the afternoon playing around with this stuff
2012-01-07T21:58:25  <mleise> another option is to use UPNP and kindly ask the router to forward the port temporarily
2012-01-07T21:58:44  <antimatroid1> i'm not too worried about ports being open
2012-01-07T21:58:58  <mleise> But that is more of an option for a release where you want to make things convenient
2012-01-07T21:59:27  <antimatroid1> so next question, where's the best ants tcp repo? :P
2012-01-07T21:59:35  <antimatroid1> rabidus's might be older?
2012-01-07T21:59:43  <thestinger> the code is really bad
2012-01-07T21:59:48  <antimatroid1> yeah i know
2012-01-07T21:59:51  <thestinger> better off starting off if you want to make something else
2012-01-07T21:59:52  <mleise> antimatroid1: with Ants TCP I was able to download arbitrary files from the server
2012-01-07T21:59:56  <thestinger> starting over*
2012-01-07T22:00:01  <antimatroid1> i will start over
2012-01-07T22:00:05  <antimatroid1> but i have zero idea of what i'm doing
2012-01-07T22:00:20  <thestinger> use a language that makes networking easy
2012-01-07T22:00:22  <thestinger> lightweight threads
2012-01-07T22:00:24  <thestinger> then it's easy
2012-01-07T22:00:28  <antimatroid1> i want to learn more about trueskill at some point too
2012-01-07T22:00:34  <mleise> If you use a ready to use TCP class, make sure you don't forget about security. Double check what you receive.
2012-01-07T22:00:35  <antimatroid1> yeah i'll use python
2012-01-07T22:00:56  <thestinger> well, python itself doesn't have lightweight threads but stackless python (which pypy supports) does
2012-01-07T22:00:56  <antimatroid1> mleise: i'll start asking you questions when i get to that
2012-01-07T22:01:01  <antimatroid1> i've never had to worry about security
2012-01-07T22:01:17  *** Fandekasp <Fandekasp!~Fandekasp@KD182249005002.au-net.ne.jp> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2012-01-07T22:01:22  <thestinger> I guess you could just make a thread for each client like the ants tcp does
2012-01-07T22:01:28  <thestinger> but that's not really a good idea
2012-01-07T22:01:46  <mleise> thestinger: why is that?
2012-01-07T22:02:26  <mleise> It sounds like the simplest solution.
2012-01-07T22:02:33  <thestinger> then you're very vulnerable to a DoS, slowloris style
2012-01-07T22:02:43  <thestinger> it also wastes a lot of resources
2012-01-07T22:03:45  <mleise> hmm, so the alternative - I guess - is to use a few worker threads and give them work now and then
2012-01-07T22:04:31  <thestinger> or, lightweight threads (which does that for you)
2012-01-07T22:04:33  <mleise> and one thread walks over the open client connections and handles the I/O and passes the work on to the other threads
2012-01-07T22:05:18  <mleise> I've never written any TCP software that had to scale well :)
2012-01-07T22:07:03  <amstan> what's the topic?
2012-01-07T22:07:31  <mleise> amstan: antimatroid1 writes a TCP server for something like project euler, but for AI
2012-01-07T22:08:07  <mleise> before the topic was: http://projecteuler.net/problem=54
2012-01-07T22:08:09  <amstan> what can it be like AI and project euler at the same time?
2012-01-07T22:08:37  <mleise> actually it is like Ants TCP, but with multiple problems/contests at the same time
2012-01-07T22:08:56  <mleise> probably like an Ants/PlanetWars/Tron TCP
2012-01-07T22:09:36  <mleise> It could be easy to add new game modules and try some new game ideas
2012-01-07T22:09:41  <amstan> what's so special about ants tcp?
2012-01-07T22:09:56  <antimatroid1> amstan: i want the site to do tcp and be able to handle multiple games
2012-01-07T22:09:59  <mleise> nothing
2012-01-07T22:10:04  <antimatroid1> so we can have past contests up as tcp servers
2012-01-07T22:10:23  <amstan> antimatroid1: tcp is not secure though, you can't be sure nobody cheated
2012-01-07T22:10:29  <antimatroid1> so?
2012-01-07T22:10:36  <antimatroid1> it's just for learning/playing around
2012-01-07T22:10:44  <amstan> i guess that could work
2012-01-07T22:10:50  <antimatroid1> new "problems" would come in the form of a contest which we would still use a server for
2012-01-07T22:10:58  <amstan> or.. you could leave it all open
2012-01-07T22:11:00  <antimatroid1> although some games could be made that never have a contest run
2012-01-07T22:11:04  <amstan> encourage all kinds of behavoirs
2012-01-07T22:11:12  <amstan> which is also fun
2012-01-07T22:11:21  <antimatroid1> it's too expensive to have servers running all the time for all past contests with all bots
2012-01-07T22:11:30  <amstan> it is, correct
2012-01-07T22:12:11  <antimatroid1> one option would be to not run games for bots with a "stabilised rank", but if the site got too popular it'd become infeasible again
2012-01-07T22:12:12  <amstan> antimatroid1: the issue is framework and maintenance
2012-01-07T22:12:19  <mleise> antimatroid1: when the server load is low, it could create bot instances for games that were requested by clients
2012-01-07T22:12:20  <amstan> we're already dying doign what we have so far
2012-01-07T22:12:52  <antimatroid1> once a contest is over and people have shared code you can't really be sure of what's what anymore anyway
2012-01-07T22:13:01  <antimatroid1> so i personally would be fine with just playing others on tcp
2012-01-07T22:13:22  <antimatroid1> we could have some bots up on servers that could ensure a bot always managed a game if it wanted
2012-01-07T22:14:25  <antimatroid1> here's another problem for you guys too, giving an overall ranking for usernames with bots in multiple games
2012-01-07T22:15:27  <antimatroid1> here's an idea too, let the person either declare a new version for their bot or clear all game history of their bot
2012-01-07T22:15:35  <antimatroid1> so people aren't needing to use new usernames so much
2012-01-07T22:15:51  <amstan> why do people need new usernames?
2012-01-07T22:16:04  <antimatroid1> check the ranking of a new version?
2012-01-07T22:16:06  <amstan> oh, for tcp, right
2012-01-07T22:16:07  <mleise> antimatroid1: or the client would identify with username and botname
2012-01-07T22:16:19  <antimatroid1> mleise: that would be good too
2012-01-07T22:16:40  <antimatroid1> username + botname and allow versions for botnames and to delete botname game histories
2012-01-07T22:17:13  <antimatroid1> should you be able to have the same botname for different games?
2012-01-07T22:17:19  <thestinger> oh
2012-01-07T22:17:23  <mleise> antimatroid1: also in version 2.0 you can offer achievements, like beating bocsimacko in PlanetWars :D
2012-01-07T22:17:29  <thestinger> I guess I need to make a little utility function for this
2012-01-07T22:17:52  <thestinger> hm
2012-01-07T22:18:10  <antimatroid1> thestinger; are you evaluating highest card right?
2012-01-07T22:18:12  <mleise> thestinger: "this" refers to what?
2012-01-07T22:18:16  <thestinger> antimatroid1: yes
2012-01-07T22:18:18  <thestinger> tie breaker
2012-01-07T22:18:21  <antimatroid1> ie. 4,5,6,6,6 vs. 4,4,6,6,6
2012-01-07T22:18:25  <thestinger> I ended up just using a tuple as the return value
2012-01-07T22:18:29  <thestinger> since 2, 1 is lower than 2, 2
2012-01-07T22:19:14  <thestinger> for rank(cards)
2012-01-07T22:19:34  <thestinger> if nothing else matches, it gets the high card
2012-01-07T22:19:48  <thestinger> 0, 8 if the high card is 8
2012-01-07T22:20:31  <thestinger> anyway I did it poorly
2012-01-07T22:20:38  <thestinger> I need to switch my representation of a hand
2012-01-07T22:20:45  <antimatroid1> another option would be to start contests without an official server to submit to for like a month and heavily push people towards tcp before submitting their bot
2012-01-07T22:20:52  <thestinger> {'C': {12}, 'D': {11}, 7: {'S'}, 11: {'D'}, 12: {'S', 'C'}, 2: {'S'}, 'S': {2, 12, 7}}
2012-01-07T22:20:57  <antimatroid1> that way we wouldn't get as many "crap" bots at the end
2012-01-07T22:20:58  <thestinger> I just have suits/values in the same dict
2012-01-07T22:21:02  <thestinger> I need to have it separate
2012-01-07T22:21:10  <antimatroid1> but we'd also have less "competitors"
2012-01-07T22:21:23  <thestinger> or I could make a utility function to separate them each time I want, but that's pointless when I can just do it properly
2012-01-07T22:21:31  <thestinger> so I need cards_by_suit and cards_by_value
2012-01-07T22:21:49  <thestinger> instead of cards, with both values and suits as keys
2012-01-07T22:22:08  <thestinger> ((i, hand.get(i, set())) for i in keys)
2012-01-07T22:22:10  <thestinger> or I can do that
2012-01-07T22:22:21  <thestinger> which is pointless
2012-01-07T22:22:49  <thestinger> to separate things into suits and values again :P
2012-01-07T22:23:13  <thestinger> like get_values(hand, "DCSH")
2012-01-07T22:23:21  <thestinger> anyway
2012-01-07T22:23:26  <thestinger> that's not really the problem
2012-01-07T22:23:31  <thestinger> I don't think I did full house properly
2012-01-07T22:24:14  <thestinger> well
2012-01-07T22:24:17  <thestinger> for each value of card
2012-01-07T22:24:56  <thestinger> I check if the number of suits is 3
2012-01-07T22:24:58  <thestinger> etc.
2012-01-07T22:25:07  <thestinger> and then I check for another card with 2
2012-01-07T22:25:10  <thestinger> yeah I guess that should work
2012-01-07T22:29:57  <thestinger> {'C': {8, 5, 6, 7}, 5: {'C'}, 6: {'C'}, 7: {'C'}, 8: {'C'}, 12: {'D'}, 'D': {12}}
2012-01-07T22:29:59  <thestinger> by suit: {'C': {8, 5, 6, 7}, 'D': {12}}
2012-01-07T22:30:01  <thestinger> by kind: {8: {'C'}, 12: {'D'}, 5: {'C'}, 6: {'C'}, 7: {'C'}}
2012-01-07T22:30:04  <thestinger> yeah, that makes my life 100x easier
2012-01-07T22:33:37  <antimatroid1> the only problem i see with past contest tcp servers is some people maybe not wanting to then share their code

2012-01-07T22:45:34  <thestinger> what do you mean?
2012-01-07T22:46:54  <thestinger> that looks like a key:value pair from a python dict
2012-01-07T22:47:13  <thestinger> anyway, socket.gethostname() is just a convenience function from the socket module
2012-01-07T22:47:42  <thestinger> socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) gets the current ip
2012-01-07T22:48:04  <thestinger> well
2012-01-07T22:48:06  <thestinger> they say host _or_ name
2012-01-07T22:48:10  <thestinger> so you can just leave it like that
2012-01-07T22:48:28  <thestinger> not sure what it's for :P
2012-01-07T22:49:35  <thestinger> usually you would do that to get an address to bind to
2012-01-07T22:49:44  <thestinger> binding to 0.0.0.0 listens on every interface
2012-01-07T22:50:05  <thestinger> if your hostname on a network is foo, then binding to foo binds to that ip
2012-01-07T22:50:29  <thestinger> antimatroid1: is that from the tcp server config or something?
2012-01-07T22:50:41  <antimatroid1> yeah
2012-01-07T22:50:49  <antimatroid1> i am trying to open the port now
2012-01-07T22:50:52  <antimatroid1> my network is being a pita
2012-01-07T22:51:12  <thestinger> anyway, now I have cards_by_suit and cards_by_kind and I've almost got a solution
2012-01-07T22:52:14  <thestinger> done royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full hour, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs and one pair
2012-01-07T22:52:20  <thestinger> just need to get the secondary ordering working
2012-01-07T22:53:24  <thestinger> anyway I give high card a score of 0 for the primary score and then work up from there, so royal flush is 9
2012-01-07T22:53:36  <thestinger> this problem is annoying as hell
2012-01-07T22:56:07  <thestinger> did it :)

2012-01-07T23:02:27  <thestinger> I didn't do any optimization
