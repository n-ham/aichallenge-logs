2011-11-29T00:10:03  <BenJackson> I feel so professional making unit test maps now
2011-11-29T00:10:18  <analyst74> lol, uni test...
2011-11-29T00:10:46  <analyst74> I gave up unit test after I had to rewrite them the 3rd time
2011-11-29T00:11:53  <BenJackson> I'm still not sure how minmax is suitable for this
2011-11-29T00:12:07  <BenJackson> minmax is based on the idea that your opponent can see your move
2011-11-29T00:12:09  <BenJackson> that's not true here
2011-11-29T00:12:58  <analyst74> same thing, you just *assume* that your opponent can figure out how you are going to move
2011-11-29T00:13:52  <BenJackson> here's a simple counterexample:
2011-11-29T00:13:58  <BenJackson> 2 ants vs 1 ant, 3 apart
2011-11-29T00:14:06  <BenJackson> 2 ants could advance and kill 1 if it didn't move
2011-11-29T00:14:15  <BenJackson> but 1 could slide sideways forcing the 2 to lose one as well
2011-11-29T00:14:23  <BenJackson> happens all the time in-game
2011-11-29T00:14:29  <analyst74> ya
2011-11-29T00:14:36  <BenJackson> now if the 2 can see the 1 move it can guarantee it is safe
2011-11-29T00:14:40  <besh> i deliberately do that in fact
2011-11-29T00:14:44  <BenJackson> it can kill if it has the opportunity, or just move
2011-11-29T00:14:58  <sf17k> does anybody want to see my pixel-drawings of combat situations that I used for studying the mechanics?
2011-11-29T00:15:02  <BenJackson> similarly if the 1 can see the 2 move it has a lot more options
2011-11-29T00:15:12  <besh> sf17k: yes
2011-11-29T00:15:27  <BenJackson> I filled up a lot of graph paper with those :)
2011-11-29T00:15:31  <sf17k> use at your own risk http://i.imgur.com/4d6c6.png
2011-11-29T00:15:46  <sf17k> color indicates ant status, players are not differentiated by color except with purple
2011-11-29T00:15:52  <analyst74> if you can prune all the possibilities, you can figure out the best result, which is possible for 2v1 situations
2011-11-29T00:15:59  <analyst74> although practically impossible for larger battles
2011-11-29T00:16:10  <analyst74> s/prune/evaluate
2011-11-29T00:16:38  <BenJackson> the funny thing is I don't understand ant combat that well
2011-11-29T00:16:43  <BenJackson> I just wrote a program that does it
2011-11-29T00:16:43  <sf17k> on the left are some interesting but useless scenarios where a large wall moves in all at once
2011-11-29T00:16:48  <BenJackson> it does things I'd never think of!
2011-11-29T00:17:09  <analyst74> it's best for the 1 ant to either retreat or slide sideways (depends on if you prefer exchange or no-loss)
2011-11-29T00:17:19  <sf17k> (because that's unlikely to happen and you'd have to be able to predict it)
2011-11-29T00:17:20  <analyst74> so the 2-ant will move accordingly
2011-11-29T00:18:00  <analyst74> but of course, you don't know if your opponent prefers to retreat or exchange, or even have combat logic at all
2011-11-29T00:19:34  <analyst74> so a naive implementation might actually work better against stronger opponent (as their behaviours are more predictable) and worse against non-combat-aware bot

2011-11-29T00:21:44  <besh> analyst74: opponent modeling  but that is not allowed
2011-11-29T00:22:11  <sf17k> the very left ones? those are situations where each side has a vertical line of forces, 2-wide, in different formations, and they move forward at the same moment to meet each other

2011-11-29T00:22:43  <analyst74> besh, opponent modeling?
2011-11-29T00:23:31  <sf17k> basically the result of that was if you KNOW your opponent is going to move forward with a straight line, you can take it out with 3 to 4 losses if you use a clever formation
2011-11-29T00:23:44  <besh> yes like poker. You try to predict opponen't moves like in the week vs strong bot move example you gave.
2011-11-29T00:23:59  <analyst74> that's not allowed?

2011-11-29T00:24:29  <besh> someone was saying you can't have an anti-xathis code f.i
2011-11-29T00:24:37  <sf17k> it's not very useful yet, anyway
2011-11-29T00:25:02  <sf17k> we haven't nailed down basic mechanics and avoiding obvious mistakes
2011-11-29T00:25:28  <analyst74> you don't know who you are playing against, so I don't think pre-defined modeling is even possible
2011-11-29T00:25:39  <besh> sf17k: I think that is a good prediction. Most bots move their ants in a straight line
2011-11-29T00:26:04  <thestinger> besh: depends on the skill level of the bots, hardly any of the top bots do that
2011-11-29T00:26:56  <analyst74> I was saying that minimax works better against stronger bot, because the algorithm assumes enemy will choose the best move
2011-11-29T00:28:40  <besh> that is correct. So you need to model oppoent behaviour to make optimal moves in every situation.
2011-11-29T00:30:42  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_foodfight since my fix at ~5:20 this seems to be doing well
2011-11-29T00:31:37  <analyst74> yeah, some sort of reinforced learning mechanism might help predict your opponent's next move, although not sure if that's an economical way to spend cpu time on
2011-11-29T00:32:41  <analyst74> thestinger, are you winning against A yet? :)

2011-11-29T01:19:17  <bmh> hopefully it'll be live on ch4n.org once DNS gets fixed
2011-11-29T01:20:08  <BenJackson> yay cul-de-sac bug fixed
2011-11-29T01:26:41  <bmh> ok, server's up

2011-11-29T01:49:23  <thestinger> besh: skill is a conservative estimate, it's 'mu - sigma*3'
2011-11-29T01:49:52  <BenJackson> conservative as in "you are almost certainly better than this"
2011-11-29T01:49:53  <besh> so it is a lower bound

2011-11-29T01:58:06  <analyst74> back to stigma, assuming 2 bots of same mu after same amount of games, but one arrived at that mu by bouncing around, the other stabilizes around that mu long time ago, is the later going to have a lower sigma, thus higher skill?

2011-11-29T02:31:51  <thestinger> took ~10 games before it changed
2011-11-29T02:32:45  <besh> yes that may be how trueskill works
2011-11-29T02:32:54  <Garf> it should update every game
2011-11-29T02:33:01  <Garf> (makes no sense not to)
2011-11-29T02:34:07  <besh> well what will be sigma after one game, nitpicking

2011-11-29T02:34:38  <besh> so it don't update every game then :)
2011-11-29T02:34:40  <Garf> don't see why, there's a defined starting value and the first game gives information
2011-11-29T02:34:54  <bmh> Garf: The variance is zero after one game.
2011-11-29T02:40:59  <Garf> bmh: I have absolutely no idea how you get that.

2011-11-29T03:00:58  <antimatroid> i don't know how many team bots we end up getting
2011-11-29T03:01:03  <antimatroid> my tron bot was a pair effort
2011-11-29T03:01:12  <bmh> there are two of us. Eric wrote a lot of infrastructure, but he's losing steam
2011-11-29T03:01:30  <antimatroid> tell him i said boooo

2011-11-29T03:02:00  <antimatroid> that was a terrible terrible mistake
2011-11-29T03:02:05  <bmh> I got rid of pathfinding.
2011-11-29T03:02:12  <antimatroid> i use it lots :)

2011-11-29T03:02:21  <antimatroid> except battle

2011-11-29T03:46:35  <antimatroid> pick offensive and defensive moves for my ants and their ants in each paritition then use those as moves in a tree/matrix
2011-11-29T03:46:40  <besh> some battles do feel like real battles with all the confrontation at frontiers

2011-11-29T03:58:09  <thestinger> do a BFS with a FIFO queue

2011-11-29T04:01:17  <Fluxid> so i takes 15x longer
2011-11-29T04:01:57  <thestinger> mine will do a bit of that, but it's still fast

2011-11-29T04:02:51  <BenJackson> "multi source BFS" is still a true BFS it just has some imaginary root node whose children happen to be all of your ants or food or whatever
2011-11-29T04:02:54  <Fluxid> but at least i would avoid multiple passes
2011-11-29T04:04:32  <BenJackson> haha due to my fluke of winnin 16 in a row on fluxid even xathis will have trouble catching me

2011-11-29T04:06:07  <Fluxid> ok, you could say what i do is BFS
2011-11-29T04:07:14  <BenJackson> besh or just never play another agme with that id ;-)
2011-11-29T04:07:16  <Fluxid> thestinger: how long your pathfinding does take?
2011-11-29T04:07:36  <Fluxid> in tital by turn
2011-11-29T04:07:38  <thestinger> when I put ~7k unseen locations onto the queue and run it, less than 1ms

2011-11-29T04:07:59  <thestinger> ~4ms-10ms, but I do hundreds of searches for different things

2011-11-29T04:08:56  <Fluxid> thestinger: do you search for the same stuff every turn?

2011-11-29T04:09:21  <BenJackson> that might make a big difference
2011-11-29T04:09:29  <BenJackson> I do hundreds of BFSs every turn sometimes

2011-11-29T04:09:35  <thestinger> my searches just use std::queue, and I store distances in a 2d std::vector of ints
2011-11-29T04:09:36  <BenJackson> and it's not my bottleneck by a long shot
2011-11-29T04:09:48  <thestinger> I don't keep track of visited nodes, I just make sure the new distance would be lower than the old one in a node
2011-11-29T04:10:07  <Fluxid> BenJackson: a queue
2011-11-29T04:10:19  <Fluxid> just structs with references to next node
2011-11-29T04:10:22  <BenJackson> Fluxid: how do you track visited?
2011-11-29T04:10:30  <BenJackson> ohhh no, that is not the right kind of queue
2011-11-29T04:10:34  <BenJackson> what language?
2011-11-29T04:10:37  <Fluxid> C
2011-11-29T04:10:49  <BenJackson> use an array and read/write pointers
2011-11-29T04:11:10  <BenJackson> you can just make the queue big enough for every possible node (rows*cols)

2011-11-29T04:11:15  <thestinger> sys/queue.h
2011-11-29T04:11:18  <Fluxid> a linked list with reference to last node, and store visited in 2D array
2011-11-29T04:11:22  <thestinger> is there a FIFO in that header?
2011-11-29T04:11:30  <ikaros> why should a queue be bad? push and pop is O(1)
2011-11-29T04:11:35  <BenJackson> insert = q[wr++] = location, dequeue is q[rd++], empty is wr==rd, ...
2011-11-29T04:11:43  <besh> shouldn't it be a priority queue ?
2011-11-29T04:11:48  <thestinger> not for BFS
2011-11-29T04:11:52  <BenJackson> besh: you're thinking of A*
2011-11-29T04:11:54  <thestinger> it should be first-in first-out
2011-11-29T04:12:06  <thestinger> so you pop off the front and push onto the end (or the other way)
2011-11-29T04:12:09  <ikaros> std::queue works great for my node list
2011-11-29T04:12:22  <BenJackson> yeah, I use std::queue, which is like what I'm describing
2011-11-29T04:12:56  <Fluxid> but the difference is, i don't stop, i "flood" whole map with distances to target, and then ants move by gradient descent
2011-11-29T04:13:01  <ikaros> ok but even if you have structs with pointers to next.. what would be bad about it?
2011-11-29T04:13:13  <Fluxid> one such flood takes 10ms on 200x200
2011-11-29T04:13:16  <BenJackson> Fluxid: yeah, that was my initial bot
2011-11-29T04:13:24  <BenJackson> fix your queue and it won't
2011-11-29T04:13:50  <Fluxid> fix? how can i fix it
2011-11-29T04:13:51  <BenJackson> your queue has too much overhead, especially if you are malloc/freeing each node
2011-11-29T04:14:00  <Fluxid> BenJackson: i cache nodes

2011-11-29T04:21:45  <Fluxid> i have the code on my home computer and i can't connect
2011-11-29T04:22:49  <BenJackson> huh, I guess cell_maze_p06_02 is a legal map by the new rules
2011-11-29T04:23:13  <Fluxid> is it the one with thick walls?

2011-11-29T04:24:07  <BenJackson> definitely need a special case for a single-hill map with a neighbor that close.
2011-11-29T04:25:58  <besh> Very close hill placements will be avoided in the final tournament.
2011-11-29T04:27:31  <besh> I think my bot can defend in that kind of situation. Problem is that is all it will do, zero exploration.
2011-11-29T04:29:17  <AntDroid> my bot X get clobbered by strcat on that one. needs to improve my combat skills. it just suicides currently
2011-11-29T04:29:46  <BenJackson> besh: very close was something like 25 squares
2011-11-29T04:29:49  <janzert> besh: those hills are far enough apart though under the current proposed distances we'll use
2011-11-29T04:29:51  <BenJackson> those hills are actually more than 25 apart
2011-11-29T04:29:54  <janzert> 36 is the cutoff
2011-11-29T04:30:44  <BenJackson> still doesn't seem like a very good map for ranking bots
2011-11-29T04:30:45  <janzert> or maybe I miscounted and they would fall just inside the cutoff
2011-11-29T04:33:55  <besh> Hills must be 100 to 250 steps away from each other
2011-11-29T04:34:19  <Fluxid> why didn't i know there's sys/queue.h...
2011-11-29T04:34:21  <janzert> 36 to 150 is what was decided earlier today
2011-11-29T04:34:22  <Fluxid> BenJackson: thanks
2011-11-29T04:34:46  <thestinger> Fluxid: it's non-standard
2011-11-29T04:34:55  <thestinger> it's from the BSDs iirc, linux has an old version of it
2011-11-29T04:35:21  <besh> Oh I didn't know that. I just read what was here yesterday http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=1973
2011-11-29T04:35:29  <janzert> besh: you can go back and look at the conversation mcleopold and I had maybe 12-14 hours ago
2011-11-29T04:35:31  <Fluxid> but it's just a header, right?
2011-11-29T04:35:34  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-29T04:35:38  <thestinger> you can count on it being there on linux
2011-11-29T04:35:47  <thestinger> it's all done with macros in a header
2011-11-29T04:35:48  <BenJackson> *I* didn't know about sys/queue.h
2011-11-29T04:35:49  <janzert> the spec page hasn't been updated yet either
2011-11-29T04:36:09  <thestinger> you can also steal the linux code for heaps, queues, etc. :P
2011-11-29T04:36:14  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-11-29T04:36:30  <BenJackson> and you know max possible q len here so you can just allocate it static

2011-11-29T08:56:34  <ThiagoRRamos> Hi
2011-11-29T08:57:41  <ThiagoRRamos> I looked for this information in the game specifications, but I didn't find it
2011-11-29T08:58:03  <avdg> what kind of information?
2011-11-29T08:58:10  <ThiagoRRamos> If an ant moves to a location where there is another ant
2011-11-29T08:58:22  <avdg> they just collide
2011-11-29T08:58:28  <thestinger> unless the other ant moves too
2011-11-29T08:58:36  <ThiagoRRamos> but this second ant is moving to somewhere else
2011-11-29T08:58:40  <avdg> and collision means that both ants are killed
2011-11-29T08:58:41  <ThiagoRRamos> do they collide?
2011-11-29T08:58:50  <thestinger> ThiagoRRamos: no, if the other ant moves too they won't collide
2011-11-29T08:59:03  <avdg> well, unless the other ant gets moved as wel
2011-11-29T08:59:13  <ThiagoRRamos> does it depends in what other my bot issues the movements?
2011-11-29T08:59:17  <ThiagoRRamos> on what*
2011-11-29T08:59:17  <avdg> so you can swap 2 ants from place without collision
2011-11-29T08:59:49  <avdg> just be sure you don't allocate 2 ants on the same tile ;-)

2011-11-29T09:25:46  <thestinger> sounds weird
2011-11-29T09:25:59  <thestinger> so you set paths and then they travel on them til they hit something?

2011-11-29T09:40:59  <antimatroid> does the engine not give scores?
2011-11-29T09:41:07  <antimatroid> i added it to the specs
2011-11-29T09:41:12  <antimatroid> and input etc.
2011-11-29T09:41:17  <antimatroid> but i didn't actually write the engine
2011-11-29T09:42:09  <rwest> I will have to train it locally :-/
2011-11-29T09:42:17  <rwest> I wish I could train it against real opponents
2011-11-29T09:42:33  <rwest> but I need to know the maximum scores to be able to weight the scores right
2011-11-29T09:42:46  <Fluxid> thestinger: if strcat_next sees enemy near hill it attacks it? what made strcat_next stand there?
2011-11-29T09:43:00  <thestinger> Fluxid: yeah
2011-11-29T09:43:11  <thestinger> it was blocking the enemy from taking the hill
2011-11-29T09:43:24  <thestinger> my defense code is kinda buggy
2011-11-29T09:43:35  <thestinger> it uses all the ants to defense for some reason, even though that's not what I tried to code
2011-11-29T09:43:39  <thestinger> to defend*
2011-11-29T09:43:44  <Fluxid> :)
2011-11-29T09:43:49  <AntDroid> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.4148 need to improve my defense here.
2011-11-29T09:44:05  <thestinger> sometimes it doesn't use all the ants to defend

2011-11-29T09:46:27  <thestinger> I reached that point

2011-11-29T09:50:23  <thestinger> my time is always 4ms before combat on 200x200 maps now
2011-11-29T09:50:41  <rwest> I should add a check for my time to see it
2011-11-29T09:50:42  <thestinger> doesn't matter how many ants I have, but it does go up to ~10ms if I bot times out and the map fills up with food
2011-11-29T09:51:05  <thestinger> if a bot times out*

2011-11-29T10:02:32  <besh> what would you do with the rest of the time :)
2011-11-29T10:02:32  <praveen> any tutorial or starting points for combat(attack/defense)?
2011-11-29T10:03:08  <thestinger> praveen: http://aichallenge.org/specification_battle.php
2011-11-29T10:03:24  <thestinger> you can turn the math/pseudo-code/python at the bottom into a function for evaluating combat
2011-11-29T10:03:36  <mleise> besh: I would update the internal state. the path finder, the symmetry detector and so on
2011-11-29T10:03:51  <praveen> Ya I understood the spec, but expecting starting points for algorithms which people use
2011-11-29T10:03:52  <besh> My bot keeps on usuing A* for unseen locations until it runs out of time. Gotta come up with some better ideas
2011-11-29T10:04:26  <thestinger> it takes me 1ms to do a multi-source BFS from every unseen location across the map
2011-11-29T10:04:27  <mleise> besh: do you cache a path once it is found
2011-11-29T10:04:44  <praveen> thestinger: I remember you were suggesting some link about game trees - Can you point me to that now
2011-11-29T10:04:52  <besh> No. I wanted to ask about it here though. How do you do it ?
2011-11-29T10:05:01  <thestinger> praveen: that wasn't me :P
2011-11-29T10:05:04  <mleise> the ant using it can keep it until you find a water tile on the path
2011-11-29T10:05:18  <rwest> finally decided to look at how much time I use
2011-11-29T10:05:28  <rwest> 160ms max per turn
2011-11-29T10:05:29  <praveen> thestinger: some tron tutorial - I could not find that
2011-11-29T10:05:40  <rwest> avg 60
2011-11-29T10:06:10  <rwest> make that 50ms
2011-11-29T10:06:13  <mleise> besh: so I would store a path object with the ant and also keep all the paths in a list, so i can go through all of them when i find a new water tile
2011-11-29T10:06:35  <mleise> if a path is blocked it is recalculated
2011-11-29T10:07:34  <besh> water tiles may get dropped in the middle of the game, so you recalculate i guess
2011-11-29T10:08:39  <besh> what I I just use a hash table with a key (source,destination) and value of (direcetion)
2011-11-29T10:08:49  <besh> what if*
2011-11-29T10:09:18  <mleise> you can do that, the memory is enough
2011-11-29T10:11:09  <besh> But when water gets dropped, it can become messy
2011-11-29T10:12:19  <besh> the whole path is needed to see if the path is affected so it may not work.
2011-11-29T10:12:31  <mleise> probably just use a map (as in 2d array in the size of the board)
2011-11-29T10:13:26  <mleise> each cell contains a pointer to another map with the directions (if it isn't a water tile)
2011-11-29T10:14:19  <mleise> new water tiles set the pointer to null and you would have to recalculate all the paths that went through that tile previously
2011-11-29T10:14:36  <mleise> or something like that ^^
2011-11-29T10:15:02  <besh> how many maps are needed for that ?
2011-11-29T10:15:22  <mleise> anyway 2 bits * 200 * 200 * 200 * 200 = 381 MB
2011-11-29T10:15:32  <thestinger> how many targets do you have at a time?
2011-11-29T10:16:02  <thestinger> I just use distance maps (usually with multiple targets per map)
2011-11-29T10:16:07  <mleise> besh: better use a BFS. i looks like it will work pretty well
2011-11-29T10:16:35  <mleise> distance map calculated through BFS ;)
2011-11-29T10:16:37  <antimatroid> http://www.sifflez.org/misc/tronbot/index.html
2011-11-29T10:16:40  <besh> I read about that in the forum.

2011-11-29T10:16:52  <antimatroid> also my planet wars bot had a very broken game tree
2011-11-29T10:17:12  <thestinger> besh: http://sprunge.us/bQZU little example
2011-11-29T10:17:47  <thestinger> 8x8 one with a target at row 1, col 3 and another at row 5, col 0

2011-11-29T10:19:37  <mleise> what does multi source mean?
2011-11-29T10:19:41  <antimatroid> besh: do you use multi targets?
2011-11-29T10:19:54  <thestinger> mleise: I use a multi-source BFS for generating the distance maps
2011-11-29T10:19:59  <antimatroid> mleise: add multiple sources to the search queue
2011-11-29T10:20:09  <thestinger> yeah, that ^
2011-11-29T10:20:14  <antimatroid> multi target requires a different heuristic function
2011-11-29T10:20:20  <besh> for food search , I start from all ants at once to the specific food target.
2011-11-29T10:20:31  <antimatroid> i do all ants to all food with a*
2011-11-29T10:20:42  <antimatroid> the iteratively collect food
2011-11-29T10:20:47  <thestinger> antimatroid: ah, with all ants as sources and all food as targets?
2011-11-29T10:20:52  <thestinger> until they're all taken
2011-11-29T10:20:54  <antimatroid> and reuse an ant if it's not going to battle an enemy on its path
2011-11-29T10:20:57  <mleise> but... A* can only handle one source and multiple targets if you check them all in the exit condition
2011-11-29T10:21:01  <antimatroid> thestinger: yeah
2011-11-29T10:21:02  <rwest> damn, I rebuilt my bot and it synced the files via dropbox and now my tcpclient at home is timing out over and over lol
2011-11-29T10:21:10  <antimatroid> mleise: not true :P
2011-11-29T10:21:17  <antimatroid> i don't think
2011-11-29T10:21:51  <thestinger> besh: well, for attacking an enemy hill - do you do A* for each ant to the hill?
2011-11-29T10:22:04  <thestinger> you can do a single BFS from a hill (or all enemy hills) and make a distance map
2011-11-29T10:22:16  <besh> mleise; right, just invert the whole process. The problem is with multi-source and multi-target
2011-11-29T10:22:17  <thestinger> then you know the distance and shortest paths from every tile on the map to the target(s)

2011-11-29T10:22:26  <mleise> if i turned it around and search from food to ants, it works as well, but i cannot see how to search in one go from multiple sources to multiple targets
2011-11-29T10:22:45  <antimatroid> an ants path length starts as their available time (0 if unmoved), then add those locations to the search queue, then hdist(x) = min manhatten distance from x to a food location
2011-11-29T10:22:52  <besh> thestinger: yes I use A* for everything as long as time allows it.
2011-11-29T10:23:02  <rwest> http://tcpants.com/replay.11432 <-- no A*, no bfs, no pathfinding whatsoever (rossxwest)
2011-11-29T10:23:13  <antimatroid> and if you reuse an ant their availability is the path length to their target square (adjacent to food in this case)
2011-11-29T10:23:15  <rwest> no battle code
2011-11-29T10:23:49  <antimatroid> where x is a location in the map that you want a minimum path distance to a target for
2011-11-29T10:24:00  <mleise> rwest: ok, that map doesn't need pathfinding ;)
2011-11-29T10:24:57  <mleise> but it is still remarkable that you won

2011-11-29T10:28:11  <besh> I wonder if I can put that on top of A* to use when I run out of time
2011-11-29T10:28:31  <thestinger> do the distance map thing :P
2011-11-29T10:28:50  <rwest> besh uses around 50ms and I diffuse (rows + cols)/2 times
2011-11-29T10:29:13  <besh> 150ms
2011-11-29T10:30:07  <rwest> I have a lot of weird things that get weighted
2011-11-29T10:30:20  <antimatroid> is anyone here using floyd warshall?
2011-11-29T10:30:20  <rwest> after I add a couple more
2011-11-29T10:30:20  <besh> thestinger: I never timeout before i send ants to food or hills. So its use is sending ants to unseen locations.
2011-11-29T10:30:29  <antimatroid> i wonder how fast that is, it sounds rather useful!
2011-11-29T10:30:42  <rwest> I am gonna train it to find good weights
2011-11-29T10:30:54  <thestinger> antimatroid: iirc, a1k0n was talking about it and decided it would use too much memory

2011-11-29T12:15:43  <amstan> ruuhkis: i don't know
2011-11-29T12:15:50  <amstan> perhaps you should contact the tcp server admin
2011-11-29T12:15:53  <ruuhkis> how should i run java bot?
2011-11-29T12:15:55  <BenJackson> ruuhkis: it does matchmaknig on a first come, first serve basis
2011-11-29T12:16:07  <BenJackson> if a match is running when you connect I've seen it time out several times and reconnect
2011-11-29T12:16:19  <ruuhkis> the match starts
2011-11-29T12:16:23  <ruuhkis> but after first turn
2011-11-29T12:16:24  <ruuhkis> it times out :o
2011-11-29T12:16:27  <BenJackson> (but when it time out it closes its connection to your bot which can cause the C++ starter to crash)
2011-11-29T12:16:46  <BenJackson> it does start your bot pretty early, so I don't think it's startup
2011-11-29T12:16:58  <ruuhkis> i added debug on loop
2011-11-29T12:17:08  <ruuhkis> and it goes thru the loop once and then on second loop it qutis

2011-11-29T13:01:51  <thestinger> the two bots with combat were @ rank 50 with low sigma due to it being broken

2011-11-29T13:11:05  <rwest> I read on the forums the tournament maps are gonna be closer tothe cell maze, so I guess it's not that bad
2011-11-29T13:11:22  <janzert> they will be a mix of the different types
2011-11-29T13:11:27  <thestinger> all maps should be cell mazes :P
2011-11-29T13:15:02  <Antimony> ug, my bot gets stuck because too many ants clump together and it is unable to caluclate a movement set for them

2011-11-29T13:50:18  <BenJackson> I did find a bug like that once
2011-11-29T13:50:26  <Fluxid> no, i removed the body of function to see how fast it calls
2011-11-29T13:50:32  <Fluxid> and forgot to recompile
2011-11-29T13:50:37  <BenJackson> someone put a sleep in a function call because some caller of it was spinning calling it
2011-11-29T13:50:43  <Fluxid> BenJackson: me too
2011-11-29T13:50:46  <BenJackson> only it turned out some other function needed to call it a lot
2011-11-29T13:50:57  <BenJackson> we thought we had some horrible performance problem

2011-11-29T13:56:17  <praveen> At turn 146, row=58,col=33 red ant is killed by two ants although they are not in range in this turn. Turn 147 red ant is not there, so it got killed in the previous turn. But clearly the two enemy ants are not in range of that red ant at 58,33
2011-11-29T13:56:20  <Minthos> memset
2011-11-29T13:56:21  <BenJackson> fluxid: you can memset it to 0

2011-11-29T13:56:55  <BenJackson> praveen: are you using arrow keys or arrow BUTTONS to advance?
2011-11-29T13:57:04  <BenJackson> you need to see the half-steps with the arrow BUTTONS to see what happened

2011-11-29T13:57:18  <BenJackson> fluxid: have to write your own loop
2011-11-29T13:57:30  <Fluxid> ok, i thought there is some other way than loop ;)
2011-11-29T13:57:31  <BenJackson> in C++, std::fill
2011-11-29T13:57:41  <BenJackson> no, memset works on char
2011-11-29T13:57:54  <pairofdice> praveen, use the buttons in the ui, not the ones on your keyboard
2011-11-29T13:58:08  <praveen> pairofdice: Ya will do and check
2011-11-29T13:58:34  <pairofdice> ui buttons show sub-turns
2011-11-29T13:58:39  <BenJackson> also someone was demonstrating last night that you can amend those replay urls with row, col, turn
2011-11-29T13:58:42  <BenJackson> if you want to show someone something
2011-11-29T13:59:13  <bqf> Fluxid: you could have a copy of it somewhere and memcpy it over the array you want to reset if you really need to reset an array to some initial state a lot of times.

2011-11-29T14:09:29  <JustStarted> I just finished the tutorial in java, and my bot behaves a bit different from the example in the tutorial. In the tutorial it says that it might differ because of the order of my ants

2011-11-29T14:09:53  <JustStarted> my question: where can i change this order, so it will be the same as the tutorial
2011-11-29T14:10:10  <BenJackson> it's due to the settings being wrong in the tutorial
2011-11-29T14:10:15  <BenJackson> there's a forum post on this somewhere
2011-11-29T14:10:28  <BenJackson> something is wrong.  viewradius?

2011-11-29T14:10:53  <BenJackson> is it in the replay?
2011-11-29T14:10:58  <ThiagoRRamos> Isn't that something related to the player_seed?

2011-11-29T14:11:39  <BenJackson> you're getting the default for playgame which doesn't match what the default was when the tutorial was written

2011-11-29T14:12:43  <besh> Juststarted: I had same problem when I started. Just make sure the order is correct. And even after that do not expect to get exact result for steps 4 & 5, due to random seeds.
2011-11-29T14:13:07  <JustStarted> Ok thanks all, but now i'm not sure how to get the order correct
2011-11-29T14:13:56  <janzert> ahh, there's a note on the first tutorial page about it. Use --viewradius 55 to match the tutorial settings
2011-11-29T14:14:06  <besh> Every step of the tutorial, it tells you where to place each piece of code. I had some confusion there.
2011-11-29T14:14:52  <BenJackson> does anyone else here test with player_seed 42 exclusively due to never bothering to change it?
2011-11-29T14:14:57  <Fluxid> BenJackson: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/514560/ here's part of my horrible code
2011-11-29T14:16:50  <BenJackson> quick easy one:  don't use fmod
2011-11-29T14:16:54  <BenJackson> use integer mod (%)
2011-11-29T14:16:55  <Fluxid> function in question is cstuff_DirectionMap_fill. it takes a list of points on map from which i start flooding (i put them to queue at line 101 while iterating over python objects)
2011-11-29T14:16:57  <JustStarted> @janzert Thanks! thats the solution to my problem
2011-11-29T14:16:58  <contestbot> JustStarted: No!
2011-11-29T14:17:07  <Fluxid> oh wait
2011-11-29T14:17:15  <Fluxid> #define fmod(a,b) (a<0?((a%b)+b)%b:a%b)
2011-11-29T14:17:31  <BenJackson> ohh
2011-11-29T14:17:38  <Fluxid> i shoudl rename it to FMOD, sorry
2011-11-29T14:17:42  <BenJackson> yes
2011-11-29T14:17:59  <Fluxid> it's because i want -1 modulo 100 == 99
2011-11-29T14:19:22  <Fluxid> 1000 iterations of running this function without block of code from 112 to 141 take 1ms. 100 iterations woth everything and one element put into stack: 5s
2011-11-29T14:19:27  <ThiagoRRamos> @BenJackson : I didn't change it, is it 42?
2011-11-29T14:19:28  <contestbot> ThiagoRRamos: No!
2011-11-29T14:19:52  <ThiagoRRamos> Thanks, contestbot!
2011-11-29T14:20:00  <Minthos> why the branch? is the branch less expensive than the second %?
2011-11-29T14:20:29  <BenJackson> Fluxid: if your limit check causes you to "continue" you leak the stack element
2011-11-29T14:20:32  <Fluxid> so flooding 1000x1000 with it takes 50ms. maybe it just can't go faster, can't say
2011-11-29T14:20:37  <BenJackson> leaking memory in a loop like this can make it verrry slow
2011-11-29T14:20:42  <Fluxid> ah, right
2011-11-29T14:21:01  * Fluxid fixes
2011-11-29T14:21:07  <Fluxid> still, i've run it without limit

2011-11-29T14:23:51  <BenJackson> well one quick thing I'd do

2011-11-29T14:24:01  <BenJackson> not knowing for sure how you're using float distances
2011-11-29T14:24:09  <BenJackson> is to put a counter in while (stack)
2011-11-29T14:24:15  <BenJackson> and make sure you're not iterating way more than rows*cols times
2011-11-29T14:24:22  <BenJackson> BFS should be linear in the number of grid squares
2011-11-29T14:24:38  <BenJackson> if your value function is causing you to revisit a lot that could cause it
2011-11-29T14:25:45  <Fluxid> BenJackson: because usenear causes paths to be slightly longer by fractions... actually usenear did cause revisiting many times
2011-11-29T14:26:08  <Fluxid> BenJackson: do you think using double could make it slower?
2011-11-29T14:26:25  <BenJackson> I'm sure it does
2011-11-29T14:26:27  <BenJackson> but not radically
2011-11-29T14:27:14  <BenJackson> do you clear out value elsewhere?

2011-11-29T14:32:41  <BenJackson> you could use ints instead of floats, you could use a simpler queue (circular list) and you could make each queue element simpler by removing "value"
2011-11-29T14:32:42  <Fluxid> i'll simplify it by removing usenear, and do second function which would do the same with usenear, as it would need priority queue to function correctly
2011-11-29T14:33:11  <Fluxid> i would then read values from map?
2011-11-29T14:33:14  <BenJackson> but none of those things is going to explain why 5ms
2011-11-29T14:33:25  <BenJackson> Fluxid: no the trick is that you put your initial locations on the queue, then a marker
2011-11-29T14:33:34  <BenJackson> when you pop the marker off, increment distance, push a new marker

2011-11-29T14:47:15  <besh> JustStarted: pretty much every one
2011-11-29T14:47:22  <ikaros> and 2) is it already permanent.. means: did i have tiles that werent explored
2011-11-29T14:47:30  <JustStarted> ok, stupid question..
2011-11-29T14:47:30  <ikaros> in those cases i have to recalculate
2011-11-29T14:47:41  <ikaros> besh, i dont think so
2011-11-29T14:47:49  <BenJackson> JustStarted: I don't think it's a stupid question
2011-11-29T14:47:56  <BenJackson> I'm not using A*, although I did play with it
2011-11-29T14:47:57  <ikaros> alot using only bfs or similar
2011-11-29T14:48:11  <besh> It is not a stupid question.
2011-11-29T14:48:21  <JustStarted> ok, im totally new to this and i tought of using A* but not sure how to create the graph
2011-11-29T14:48:25  <g0llum> JustStarted, a* vs bfs is an ongoing flamewar here

2011-11-29T14:48:58  <ikaros> na its just a matter of purpose id say :)
2011-11-29T14:48:58  <BenJackson> the graph is sort of imaginary here
2011-11-29T14:49:02  <BenJackson> every square is a node
2011-11-29T14:49:10  <BenJackson> and the squares all ahve edges to their cardinal neighbors
2011-11-29T14:49:17  <BenJackson> you really don't want to construct a special "graph" of that
2011-11-29T14:49:20  <BenJackson> it's just implied
2011-11-29T14:49:29  <JustStarted> Ok :) Thanks again

2011-11-29T14:52:02  <besh> But seriously what you can do with breadth first search, you can do better with a*
2011-11-29T14:53:27  <g0llum> a* will show you the way to ne next whikey bar, but all it does is 1on1, while bfs can be 1on many, or many on many
2011-11-29T14:53:40  <ikaros> like calculating all best routes to one or more targets? =)
2011-11-29T14:53:45  <olexs> a* can do one on many and many on 1 and many on many just fine

2011-11-29T14:54:43  <olexs> but needs slightly more complex data structuring than bfs. my bot utilizes both, switching to a* when heuristics are available and search radius is sufficiently large
2011-11-29T14:55:11  <ikaros> yea i will add an a* too when i reach optimization
2011-11-29T14:55:26  <ikaros> have different tasks where i do bfs for a single target which is crap
2011-11-29T14:55:31  <besh> Any language with a binary heap implementation eases implmentation of a*
2011-11-29T14:55:31  <Antimony> Why does my new bot keep losing to really old versions?
2011-11-29T14:55:33  <JustStarted> well im totally new to AI programming so i'm just going to try implementing A*, if that works ill see what i can optimize
2011-11-29T14:55:38  <ikaros> but so far its fast enough so no need to waste time

2011-11-29T14:58:04  <JustStarted> hmm, but im using a book and that suggests A*, and i would like to implement it :P
2011-11-29T14:58:08  <JustStarted> im using java :)
2011-11-29T14:58:32  <JustStarted> i've never used it before but i know C# and found it easier to do the tutorial using java
2011-11-29T14:58:37  <olexs> go for it if you want to. but keep in mind that it definitely is more complicated than bfs
2011-11-29T14:58:41  <ikaros> well its all up to you. implementing a* is surely no mistake :)
2011-11-29T14:58:46  <JustStarted> good point to start using java too, for now it's not a lot different
2011-11-29T14:59:21  <g0llum> JustStarted, still 3 weeks to go, so whatever gives you a good start, take that.
2011-11-29T14:59:55  <JustStarted> I'll do my best implementing A*, if i cant manage to make that work i'll try bfs first
2011-11-29T15:02:20  <BenJackson> Fluxid: ok, I ran it locally
2011-11-29T15:02:24  <BenJackson> without python at all
2011-11-29T15:02:37  <Fluxid> ikaros: the problem is that ants standing on a path make the path longer. so as ants move i need to update the map
2011-11-29T15:02:40  <BenJackson> takes 3.5ms, with -O3 it takes 1.4ms
2011-11-29T15:02:53  <Fluxid> for how big map?
2011-11-29T15:02:57  <BenJackson> 200x200
2011-11-29T15:03:37  <besh> fluxid: do you consider ants unpassable ?
2011-11-29T15:03:39  <ikaros> you mean own ants or enemy ants?
2011-11-29T15:03:56  <Fluxid> own
2011-11-29T15:03:59  <ikaros> because i ignore them when calculating distance maps
2011-11-29T15:04:43  <Fluxid> besh: if there are many own ants on the path then ants farther away can go around
2011-11-29T15:05:08  <ikaros> thats true but you move most ants each turn anyways id guess
2011-11-29T15:05:14  *** sofuture <sofuture!u515@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-anxmulfgmqjstajz> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-29T15:05:17  <Fluxid> and this spreads ants a bit if there are many possible paths
2011-11-29T15:05:22  <ikaros> and you "push" them away with priorities
2011-11-29T15:05:51  <ikaros> hm ok yea i handle the spreading seperately
2011-11-29T15:06:07  <ikaros> separately?
2011-11-29T15:06:18  <Fluxid> http://paste.aichallenge.org/sq8OH/
2011-11-29T15:06:54  <Fluxid> BenJackson: damn, i need to measure it more
2011-11-29T15:07:25  <besh> fluxid: that is exactly my problem. My ants always follow the best possible path, even though there are other sub-optimal that avoid congestion.
2011-11-29T15:07:38  <Fluxid> ikaros: in that paste, making path longer make ants go to sides
2011-11-29T15:08:07  <Fluxid> but are too spread though..
2011-11-29T15:08:22  <ikaros> yea i understand. i just dont handle the spreading via my distance maps but thats probably just a design choice
2011-11-29T15:08:56  <Fluxid> BenJackson: thank you for your time
2011-11-29T15:10:00  <BenJackson> FLuxid: avoiding real work :)
2011-11-29T15:10:10  <besh> fluxid: That looks great. Can you explain a bit more of the spreading ?
2011-11-29T15:10:48  <Fluxid> BenJackson: work on your bot or some other real-real work?
2011-11-29T15:11:05  <BenJackson> Fluxid: looking at some profiling I have laying around suggests I get similar results to your code when compiled with optimization
2011-11-29T15:11:13  <BenJackson> real-real work
2011-11-29T15:11:42  <BenJackson> after my bugfix release last night I have to wait a while to rank up on aichallenge
2011-11-29T15:11:51  <BenJackson> game 5 I started next to xathis, ow
2011-11-29T15:12:16  <BenJackson> his defense against me was pretty sweet though
2011-11-29T15:12:19  <BenJackson> I need to emulate that
2011-11-29T15:12:31  <Fluxid> besh: ant standing on the path make the path longer. that's all :) in that case i was adding +1 to path length under the ant, +0.6 by it and +0.3 one cell away from ant
2011-11-29T15:12:45  <olexs> what are people using for spreading out their ants over the "controlled" area? the process looks a lot like molecular diffusion, but I can't think of any efficient algorithms to implement that...
2011-11-29T15:12:46  <Fluxid> BenJackson: link to game?
2011-11-29T15:12:52  <Fluxid> also, what do you do for real fork?
2011-11-29T15:12:54  <Fluxid> work*
2011-11-29T15:13:18  <besh> fluxid: smart idea. I will try it.
2011-11-29T15:13:23  <g0llum> and a spoon
2011-11-29T15:14:13  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=144100&user=3473
2011-11-29T15:14:27  <Fluxid> olexs: i'd like to know a nice solution too... i just go to part which isn't in visible area
2011-11-29T15:15:03  <BenJackson> olexs: I also couldn't think of any efficient ways to do it so I did it inefficiently and that was fast enough
2011-11-29T15:15:06  <ikaros> olexs, perhaps it would be possible to do some kind of mass-spring system but i think it would be computationally to expensive
2011-11-29T15:15:06  <BenJackson> much to my surprise
2011-11-29T15:15:18  <Fluxid> BenJackson: that was a fast game
2011-11-29T15:15:21  <BenJackson> yep
2011-11-29T15:15:51  <Fluxid> you weren't really able to do anything...
2011-11-29T15:16:11  <BenJackson> he did a nice job of killing off my small attack party, though
2011-11-29T15:16:21  <Fluxid> oh, i've got a game with you, but with version 8
2011-11-29T15:16:24  <BenJackson> which I clearly could have avoided with a lot more lookahead

2011-11-29T15:18:28  <Fluxid> typical on massive multihill maps
2011-11-29T15:18:28  <olexs> given an area, I want the ants to spread out as equally as possible, leaving no invisible areas and no tight groups
2011-11-29T15:18:56  <BenJackson> every ant has 4 hills and on turn 36 just before most of the taking happens the average bot has 10 ants
2011-11-29T15:19:03  <BenJackson> barely 2/hill
2011-11-29T15:19:31  <BenJackson> winner is determined on about turn 47
2011-11-29T15:19:52  <besh> Here is a video of what I did for spreading out ants some time ago http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmIlhMSGX_c
2011-11-29T15:19:55  <olexs> the exploration/spread I have so far is based on a completely different principle and works, but not really very well
2011-11-29T15:20:03  <BenJackson> I've considered it but strategies to optimize for that case would probably lose you most games
2011-11-29T15:20:03  <Fluxid> olexs: i do two things: 1. pathfind to unvisible area 2. for every ant i calculate vectors to all other ants and go in direction where are less ants
2011-11-29T15:20:32  <Fluxid> the closer are other ants the stronger is the repelling force
2011-11-29T15:20:35  <Fluxid> something like that
2011-11-29T15:20:38  <besh> With a dummy opponent though... I try to put the ants view_radius apart to maximize view
2011-11-29T15:20:59  <bhasker> how are you guys handling combat?
2011-11-29T15:21:08  <bhasker> my bot seems to have trouble with combat a lot:(
2011-11-29T15:21:08  <BenJackson> first I bring more ants to the party
2011-11-29T15:21:12  <BenJackson> then I kill the enemy ants
2011-11-29T15:21:19  <BenJackson> unless they bring MORE to the party
2011-11-29T15:21:33  <olexs> Fluxid: that sounds reasonable... build vectors to all ants in visible radius and just sum them
2011-11-29T15:21:50  <Fluxid> bhasker: after calculating new ants posiotions i check if any ant may be killed. then i modify weights for those ants and recalculate moves. and then again. and again. until looking good.
2011-11-29T15:22:07  <Fluxid> fucking inefficient
2011-11-29T15:22:11  <BenJackson> interesting
2011-11-29T15:22:12  <Fluxid> and not really useful
2011-11-29T15:22:55  <bhasker> hmm i was thinking of doing a small minmax when entering combat
2011-11-29T15:23:01  <bhasker> but it seems too complicated
2011-11-29T15:23:12  <olexs> bhasker: min-max search with fairly complex move generator working on ant clusters
2011-11-29T15:23:22  <Fluxid> because ants are too scared and this causes deadlocks like here: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.2000
2011-11-29T15:23:30  <bhasker> yes something like that just that my code isn't really structured for minmax very well
2011-11-29T15:23:53  <olexs> mine was from the beginning, so it wasn't too complicated implementing
2011-11-29T15:24:07  <bhasker> how does it work, is it doing the right thing?
2011-11-29T15:24:25  <olexs> just look at fights by olexs_* bots on tcp
2011-11-29T15:24:31  <Fluxid> i didn't know how to apply minimax for lots of ants so i just used my intuition...

2011-11-29T16:01:10  <a1k0n> you'd have to break in
2011-11-29T16:02:40  <ThiagoRRamos> Is there really a way of making a bot output something?

2011-11-29T16:28:20  <BenJackson> if you write to stderr you have to pass an option to playgame to allow it

2011-11-29T16:45:46  <McLeopold> what language?
2011-11-29T16:45:52  <pairofdice> python 3
2011-11-29T16:46:04  <McLeopold> you'll need to call sys.stderr.flush() after writing
2011-11-29T16:46:39  <McLeopold> you can call it once just before finish_turn()

2011-11-29T19:11:51  <rwest_> after enough time of not seeing his hill, my ants would have wanted to see it more than anything

2011-11-29T19:15:14  <NoirSoldats> I am experiencing an issue with the PHP starter pack in attempting to dump out debug information locally.. Even opening and writing to a file doesn't work... ideas?
2011-11-29T19:15:48  <avdg> use the error stream?
2011-11-29T19:15:54  <rwest_> NoirSoldats: no idea, maybe just do an exec

2011-11-29T20:38:40  <antimatroid> other ideas would be multi source and a* obviously
2011-11-29T20:38:55  <BenJackson> I could make another illustrating multi-source
2011-11-29T20:40:12  * avdg wonders if it would fit in the visualizer
2011-11-29T20:40:27  <antimatroid> even more awesome, if you made an applet, let people put targets in, pick a path finding method then have it animate finding the path
2011-11-29T20:40:31  <antimatroid> and show the found path at the end

2011-11-29T22:08:38  <BenJackson> reprise of stats from yesterday
2011-11-29T22:08:39  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/valarray what the hell?
2011-11-29T22:08:47  <BenJackson> that's bj_v9 vs 2, 3, 4, ... players, number of games, average place
2011-11-29T22:08:51  <BenJackson> I still suck at 6?!
2011-11-29T22:09:03  <thestinger> BenJackson: maybe the 6-player map is a terrible one
2011-11-29T22:09:36  <BenJackson> std::valarray reminds me of Matlab
2011-11-29T22:09:58  <thestinger> reminds me of numpy :P
2011-11-29T22:10:00  <BenJackson> if I parse that right, though, I won all of my 2 and 3 player games

2011-11-29T22:11:00  <pairofdice> Yes, and TrueSkill takes gradually less ranking info from games with more players
2011-11-29T22:11:42  <BenJackson> one of my recent aichallenge games I lost due to starting next to xathis
2011-11-29T22:11:57  <BenJackson> at that moment I really felt it should take WHO took your hill into account and not just who else was in the game :)

2011-11-29T22:19:08  <thestinger> the 'random' part of their name holds true

2011-11-29T22:20:25  <BenJackson> if you can tell me the last n pages of results to use I can
2011-11-29T22:20:50  <BenJackson> I've played 152 games on fluxid overnight, I'm sure you have lots of data
2011-11-29T22:20:56  <roflmao> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.5222 WTF?
2011-11-29T22:21:11  <thestinger> BenJackson: ah, try the first page
2011-11-29T22:21:19  <bmh> BenJackson: stop parking four ants around your hill. It makes me sad
2011-11-29T22:21:32  <BenJackson> on your server?
2011-11-29T22:21:40  <thestinger> bmh: they used to massacre me before I had prediction of enemy movement
2011-11-29T22:21:46  <bmh> nah, on fluxid
2011-11-29T22:21:49  <thestinger> they give the illusion of static defense :P

2011-11-29T22:21:56  <thestinger> they're really just like assigned dynamic defenders
2011-11-29T22:21:59  <BenJackson> they are just my static defense code never removed
2011-11-29T22:22:16  <BenJackson> mainly they're there to ensure I have hill vision
2011-11-29T22:22:33  <BenJackson> although the recent game I didn't win outright on aichallenge was due to really crap defending

2011-11-29T22:28:44  <BenJackson> note how purple got taken
2011-11-29T22:28:53  <BenJackson> big defense vs me, blue walks in the back door
2011-11-29T22:29:22  <bugnuts> thats because my bot is the lame :)
2011-11-29T22:29:36  <thestinger> bugnuts: my defense weights enemies by distance to my hill
2011-11-29T22:29:43  <thestinger> it sucks for other reasons but that part of defending works :)
2011-11-29T22:30:10  <bugnuts> yeah, my problem is I am greedy on patching to defence points which means it won't go back to defend the hill.
2011-11-29T22:30:43  <thestinger> my problem is that I prioritize ants closer to my hill as defenders
2011-11-29T22:30:51  <thestinger> so they all end up defending despite the # being limited
2011-11-29T22:31:02  <BenJackson> you should look at xathis's defense vs me on aichallenge
2011-11-29T22:31:35  <BenJackson> you can see (at least I think) some really early movement to encircle my sortie
2011-11-29T22:32:01  <bugnuts> I also over allocate to defense since I don;t pay enough attention to attacker distance
2011-11-29T22:32:18  <thestinger> BenJackson: it would be awesome to get that map data stuff onto a stats page for the tcp server
2011-11-29T22:32:40  <BenJackson> does the tcp server use a real db?
2011-11-29T22:32:42  <bugnuts> so in a lot of matches I will get starved by a small number of attackers

2011-11-29T22:33:05  <bugnuts> mostly the real problem is I have no combat :(
2011-11-29T22:33:10  <BenJackson> V7 would definitely collapse onto the base in defense
2011-11-29T22:33:16  <BenJackson> and after that I'd never recover
2011-11-29T22:33:28  <thestinger> BenJackson: yeah, it uses sqlite
2011-11-29T22:33:33  <BenJackson> new theory is that the home ants better hold out because if I stop foraging to save home I'll just lose later

2011-11-29T22:36:01  <thestinger> because if I'm not foraging, I'm screwed anyway
2011-11-29T22:36:11  <thestinger> I need an ant to stay there and keep vision of the area around my hill though
2011-11-29T22:36:23  <thestinger> I'll just always make a square around my hill a forage target

2011-11-29T22:37:39  <BenJackson> I wonder if "ants not razing hills" could have an exception for combat
2011-11-29T22:37:44  <BenJackson> not like I wasn't trying!
2011-11-29T22:38:18  <thestinger> BenJackson: did you see that replay where my bot was 3 steps from the hill and that happened?
2011-11-29T22:38:20  <thestinger> xD
2011-11-29T22:38:28  <thestinger> 3 steps from an undefended hill
2011-11-29T22:40:23  <amstan> BenJackson: what kind of exception?
2011-11-29T22:40:36  <BenJackson> enemy ants near hill?
2011-11-29T22:40:47  <BenJackson> I assume it's just to avoid wasting server time on starter bots or forage-only bots
2011-11-29T22:40:58  <thestinger> or standoffs where ants aren't killing each other
2011-11-29T22:41:04  <BenJackson> we can waste time on that
2011-11-29T22:41:05  <thestinger> if ants are actually dying, it shouldn't end
