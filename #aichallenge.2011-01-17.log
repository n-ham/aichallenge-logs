2011-01-17T05:12:35  <delt0r_> the forum just got some spam
2011-01-17T05:28:04  <antimatroid1> interesting spam
2011-01-17T05:41:50  <rabidus> i have an idea for AI game ;)
2011-01-17T05:42:55  <antimatroid1> ..
2011-01-17T05:42:56  <rabidus> a bot who buys USD from EURs and vice versa. Bot who has gained the most cash wins.
2011-01-17T05:42:59  <rabidus> :)
2011-01-17T05:43:09  <antimatroid1> it's not really a game though
2011-01-17T05:43:20  <rabidus> yeah, well.. at least there is huge motivator :)
2011-01-17T05:43:26  <antimatroid1> jeff was quite interested in some kind of prediction game
2011-01-17T05:43:37  <rabidus> jeff ?
2011-01-17T05:43:38  <antimatroid1> but imo it'd be better if people's predictions affected the result they are predicting
2011-01-17T05:43:42  <antimatroid1> j3camero
2011-01-17T05:43:45  <rabidus> ok
2011-01-17T05:45:11  <sigh> predicting what?
2011-01-17T05:45:27  <antimatroid1> j3camero was weather i think, this would certainly be better
2011-01-17T05:45:34  <antimatroid1> this is predicting exchange rates
2011-01-17T05:46:02  <sigh> then it becomes more a data mining comp
2011-01-17T05:46:19  <antimatroid1> for this yeah, and kaggle seems to do those already
2011-01-17T05:46:30  <antimatroid1> i quite like the simultaneous GAMES, but that is just one opinion
2011-01-17T05:46:41  <sigh> was just going to mention kaggle :P

2011-01-17T05:47:07  <antimatroid1> i would be down for some kind of economics game, but no idea how to make it
2011-01-17T05:47:15  <antimatroid1> i should really put some thought into that some time
2011-01-17T05:48:21  <antimatroid1> actually, an emulated stock market could work well
2011-01-17T05:48:34  <antimatroid1> you could do it for currency exchange, it's all the same thing essentially
2011-01-17T05:51:03  <sigh> mega1 has enough of an advantage as it is
2011-01-17T05:51:25  <sigh> without you making stock exchange games
2011-01-17T05:51:52  <mega1> I'm pretty much bored to death by the financial domain.
2011-01-17T05:52:11  <sigh> oh hey :P
2011-01-17T05:52:17  <mega1> but if the mechanics are simple enough ...
2011-01-17T05:53:11  <antimatroid1> i want a game where there is more than a couple of components to it
2011-01-17T05:53:18  <antimatroid1> but it seems most people don't want that at all
2011-01-17T05:53:30  <antimatroid1> that's also why i liked my ants and the snowballs game
2011-01-17T05:53:36  <sigh> the problem with having a lot of components is that it is hard to balance
2011-01-17T05:53:53  <mega1> yup

2011-01-17T06:44:20  <sigh> water water everywhere but not a drop to drink
2011-01-17T06:44:26  <antimatroid1> pretty much

2011-01-17T09:25:42  <amstan_irssi> i think we need a new captcha
2011-01-17T09:28:26  <antimatroid1> amstan_irssi: can you guys consider stratego for the next game
2011-01-17T09:29:44  <amstan_irssi> seems complicated.. someone go make a visualizer
2011-01-17T09:40:51  <antimatroid1> making a visualiser is too much effort for all the game ideas being thrown out
2011-01-17T09:41:38  <antimatroid1> i could be a minority, but i'm in favour of a much harder game

2011-01-17T19:28:02  <amstan> freaking 2 way merge... people should be banned from merging if they don't know what a 3 way merge is

2011-01-17T22:57:38  <amstan> we have another idea for the contest
2011-01-17T22:57:50  <amstan> we have good marketing for it
2011-01-17T22:57:54  <amstan> super easy to implement
2011-01-17T22:58:00  <amstan> but.. we're not sure strategy wise again
2011-01-17T22:58:18  <amstan> problems with existing games: stratego too complicated
2011-01-17T22:58:25  <amstan> ants too awesome for the next one, will do later
2011-01-17T22:58:37  <amstan> tron is difficult and we're affraid of getting sued
2011-01-17T22:58:52  <amstan> also.. ants need a good multi player rankings algo
2011-01-17T23:17:45  <jmcarthur> so... what's the idea?
