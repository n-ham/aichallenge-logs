2011-11-07T03:22:13  <Garf> No drop from 50 games -> 500 games
2011-11-07T03:22:16  <Garf> that makes no sense
2011-11-07T03:22:34  <Garf> It's basically saying those 450 extra games provided no information about strength

2011-11-07T03:29:02  <Garf> but yeah, the calculations there seem to be entirely broken
2011-11-07T03:29:04  <userjjb> Zao: I see what you mean about using a class or an enum. But how would you dynamically populate the enum at execution time?
2011-11-07T03:29:16  <Garf> dynamically? not in C++
2011-11-07T03:29:22  <Garf> C++ has static typing
2011-11-07T03:29:22  <userjjb> heh, thought so

2011-11-07T05:18:18  <liberforce> spp: Depending on the quality of the starter package, you'd keep it or rewrite it
2011-11-07T05:18:40  <liberforce> the C implementation for aguments parsing was auwful
2011-11-07T05:18:57  <spp> yeah I will try to use it the way it is, and if it bothers me a lot I would change
2011-11-07T05:19:03  <liberforce> that's when I understood there was no clever-trick, just poor programming

2011-11-07T05:19:13  <spp> ?
2011-11-07T05:19:14  <pairofdice> I wouldn't know any of that so I use the starter package
2011-11-07T05:19:47  <spp> Java impl is better in that way

2011-11-07T05:59:53  <retybok> When will the challenge end? How will the final rankings be computed?
2011-11-07T06:01:47  <pairofdice> The current phase of the contest will end December 18th at 11:59pm EST. At that time submissions will be closed. Shortly thereafter the final tournament will be started. The length of the final tournament has not yet been determined but is expected to last less than one week. Upon completion the contest winner will be announced and all results will be publically available.
2011-11-07T06:02:19  <userjjb> pairofdice: It does have one where I pasted it on Facebook, sort of, since Facebook doesn't seem to like the alt="" part of a href tag I just made it link to my alt text so you'll see it if you mouseover and look below in the status bar
2011-11-07T06:03:19  <userjjb> It says "The only annoying part is that the dimensions have to match the ratio of the first perfect squares..."

2011-11-07T06:14:42  <delt0r_> the next ai challenge should be stratego! just played against my wife.
2011-11-07T06:14:50  <delt0r_> would be cool
2011-11-07T06:15:13  <pairofdice> Or Go ;x
2011-11-07T06:15:39  <retybok> go wouldn't be fun, because there is already a lot of literature on the subject
2011-11-07T06:15:42  <delt0r_> meh Go there is lots of Go ai comps out there
2011-11-07T06:15:51  <pairofdice> Sure
2011-11-07T06:15:52  <retybok> a lot of time would simply be spent implementing known strategies
2011-11-07T06:16:04  <pairofdice> Yea I guess that would be bad
2011-11-07T06:16:04  <g0llum> deltor_, isn't stratego copyrighted ?
2011-11-07T06:16:27  <delt0r_> The game yes... but not the idea... as in like planetwars
2011-11-07T06:16:48  <delt0r_> you can only copyright a specific implementation of a idea.
2011-11-07T06:16:55  <delt0r_> aka all the monoply clones
2011-11-07T06:17:01  <delt0r_> and video game clones
2011-11-07T06:17:10  <retybok> I don't care what the next challenge is, but it should be something very different
2011-11-07T06:17:12  <delt0r_> But yes its something to consider
2011-11-07T06:17:21  <retybok> ants and planetwars are a bit too similar IMHO
2011-11-07T06:17:25  <delt0r_> free and OS is definatly the starndard for here
2011-11-07T06:17:29  <retybok> even if they are a lot of fun :)
2011-11-07T06:18:19  <delt0r_> retybok: what type of game do you would want
2011-11-07T06:19:17  <delt0r_> would you want
2011-11-07T06:19:47  <retybok> I don't know, just something different :)
2011-11-07T06:20:23  <delt0r_> Well the basic requirement is that it it should interesting/entertaining to watch
2011-11-07T06:20:23  <retybok> One thing I really like about ants is that it's multiplayer
2011-11-07T06:20:34  <delt0r_> and a basic bot should be possible
2011-11-07T06:20:40  <retybok> it changes quite a bit from the previous two-palyer games
2011-11-07T06:22:14  <delt0r_> hidden information was considered important
2011-11-07T06:22:26  <delt0r_> rather than the complete information of planet wars
2011-11-07T06:25:23  <retybok> I think adding an element of luck would be interesting as well
2011-11-07T06:25:33  <retybok> dice rolls for example
2011-11-07T06:25:58  <retybok> I agree fog of war is pretty cool
2011-11-07T06:27:02  <pairofdice> How about something with less agents but more things they can do, like mechs
2011-11-07T06:27:46  <Garf> i wouldn't mind xcom/jagged alliance/frozen synapse turnbased tactics with fog of war

2011-11-07T07:16:16  <thestinger> it seems like someone could just connect with 10000 tcp clients and it would allow that

2011-11-07T07:22:36  <NoxiaZ^> Hey, Rule: Use of multiple processes or OS threads are prohibited. - Im not sure that OS threads means, but to be sure, its not allowed to use any form for threads ?
2011-11-07T07:22:49  <NoxiaZ^> that = what*
2011-11-07T07:23:00  <thestinger> what language are you using?
2011-11-07T07:23:03  <NoxiaZ^> C#
2011-11-07T07:23:27  <thestinger> so don't use threads, they'll use OS threads

2011-11-07T07:23:39  <NoxiaZ^> oki
2011-11-07T07:24:38  <thestinger> Go lets you use lightweight threads (goroutines) which are multiplexed over N os threads (1 by default) and ofc that's what Erlang is all about
2011-11-07T07:25:30  <thestinger> I think using multiple OS threads (pthreads) would steal processing time from the other bots with the way it's set up

2011-11-07T07:36:19  <thestinger> it takes like a hundred of them to break through his defense of a dozen ants
2011-11-07T07:36:47  <Minthos> yeah A has pretty good micro
2011-11-07T07:39:02  <lorill> what color are you in this replay ?
2011-11-07T07:39:26  <thestinger> strcat (both of them :P)
2011-11-07T07:40:01  <lorill> haha
2011-11-07T07:40:13  <lorill> I see. You're the one that's always rushing me, then :)
2011-11-07T07:40:19  <thestinger> well, strcat_next is basically my current code and strcat_forage is a branch I'm working on
2011-11-07T07:40:28  <thestinger> "strcat" is old crappy code that sucks :P
2011-11-07T07:40:35  <lorill> do you try to guess where other hills are, or dou you often get lucky when scouting ?
2011-11-07T07:40:42  <thestinger> atm I just get lucky
2011-11-07T07:41:05  <thestinger> I just have a few heuristics to prevent my ants from suiciding, so they are very aggressive
2011-11-07T07:41:09  <lorill> damned. I would have hoped you could tell me how you guess them :(
2011-11-07T07:41:16  <thestinger> I'd like to keep them pretty aggressive when I get real combat done
2011-11-07T07:41:21  <thestinger> well, symmetry
2011-11-07T07:41:23  <thestinger> look at the maps
2011-11-07T07:41:31  <thestinger> the hills are all laid out the same way
2011-11-07T07:41:36  <lorill> yeah, but i don't know how to exploit it
2011-11-07T07:41:51  <lorill> i mean, I can't simply reverse the coords
2011-11-07T07:41:54  <thestinger> so if you find one hill, I guess you can use the distances to other hills you know about and plot a bunch of possible hills on a map
2011-11-07T07:42:00  <thestinger> I dunno xD

2011-11-07T07:43:02  <thestinger> yeah, you could take the shortest vertical/horizontal distance to another hill and then stick a bunch of possible hills on a map
2011-11-07T07:43:37  <thestinger> I think that would be better than my exploration towards any unexplored areas (without prioritizing) that I do atm

2011-11-07T07:53:20  <NoxiaZ^> What algorithm are you guys using for discover the terrain?
2011-11-07T07:53:39  <lorill> several different ones
2011-11-07T07:53:47  <lorill> 1. I assign some scout points on the map
2011-11-07T07:53:53  <lorill> equidistants, but randomized
2011-11-07T07:54:05  <lorill> and while they're unexplored, a* to them
2011-11-07T07:54:48  <lorill> 2. for unmoved ants after important things, move to the cell that wasn't walked on for the longest time
2011-11-07T07:55:12  <lorill> works ok, but not perfect in maze
2011-11-07T07:55:21  <NoxiaZ^> ahh but ye its a way to do it
2011-11-07T07:56:01  <NoxiaZ^> but i thought at A* needed to "know" the terrain to move? Like D* would do better when you dont know the terrain yet?

2011-11-07T07:56:52  <NoxiaZ^> And again i was like thinking, where to start moving? - But thats pretty smart to put up some scout points, and then grap the foot on the way
2011-11-07T07:56:52  <lorill> after all, the aim is to discover it, so that doesn't matter too much
2011-11-07T07:57:01  <NoxiaZ^> ahh ye ofc

2011-11-07T07:57:25  <NoxiaZ^> My next problem is, it dosnt seems like there are any ID's on the ants?
2011-11-07T07:57:45  <lorill> all ants are born equal :)
2011-11-07T07:57:58  <lorill> do you really care which ant does what ? its position should be enough
2011-11-07T07:58:10  <NoxiaZ^> So how do you keep track on what ants you are using to discover, find food, protect your hill and what you wanna start killing with?
2011-11-07T07:58:12  <lorill> or if you care, you can track them by using their expected position
2011-11-07T07:58:24  <lorill> i don't care
2011-11-07T07:58:32  <lorill> i always use the closest available one
2011-11-07T07:58:41  <NoxiaZ^> ahh oki
2011-11-07T07:59:08  <lorill> I had a previous version that did the tracking, but it doesn't really help
2011-11-07T08:00:54  <NoxiaZ^> ahh oki, but keep tracking for the next position will also cost much more time then just use the closest one for the job . But ideal will ofc be that they had an id :D
2011-11-07T08:01:26  <NoxiaZ^> And ofc for the defence, you can just use the new spawned that move the old one :P - Seems as an idea :D like swapping places ! =)

2011-11-07T11:48:54  <RasmusL> i have a little question :P
2011-11-07T11:48:55  <Antimony> How do you get your ants to spread out?
2011-11-07T11:49:04  <Minthos> isbric: nice, so that's what the netsplits earlier today were about :)
2011-11-07T11:49:20  <RasmusL> in python, i have a global variable in one module that i use in another module
2011-11-07T11:49:32  <RasmusL> but its value is constant, it doesn't change although i change it in the first module?
2011-11-07T11:50:04  <caution> perhaps you need to use the global keyword
2011-11-07T11:50:14  <RasmusL> i use global when i change it
2011-11-07T11:50:25  <thestinger> if the global is called 'x' and you're in a function, x = 5 will make a local called x, shadowing the global
2011-11-07T11:50:27  <thestinger> etc.
2011-11-07T11:50:47  <RasmusL> yeah i do global x then x=5
2011-11-07T11:50:54  <RasmusL> but in the other module it's still 0
2011-11-07T11:51:01  <thestinger> well how do you import the module?
2011-11-07T11:51:07  <RasmusL> import module :)
2011-11-07T11:51:16  <RasmusL> and of course module.x
2011-11-07T11:51:23  <thestinger> so why do you use global x?
2011-11-07T11:51:43  <RasmusL> hmm?
2011-11-07T11:52:00  <caution> paste your code

2011-11-07T12:09:23  <mcstar> maybe, cause without the gloval keyword, it would only work that way?
2011-11-07T12:09:24  <thestinger> scoping used to be a lot different, but I think that was a long time ago
2011-11-07T12:10:15  <thestinger> I think it's been the same way as long as python 2 has existed
2011-11-07T12:10:20  <mcstar> thestinger: not that long ago, i havent used it for 2 years, since i only wrote little scripts for data analysis
2011-11-07T12:10:23  <RasmusL> hmm
2011-11-07T12:10:30  <thestinger> python 2.1*
2011-11-07T12:10:35  <thestinger> yeah, so it had proper scoping when you used it
2011-11-07T12:10:43  <mcstar> sure it did
2011-11-07T12:10:51  <mcstar> maybe i just didnt know about the global keyword
2011-11-07T12:11:22  <RasmusL> the thing is, the turnnum variable isn't even referenced anywhere other than what i pasted
2011-11-07T12:11:26  <RasmusL> i just searched for it
2011-11-07T12:11:39  <RasmusL> so there's not much more to see
2011-11-07T12:11:42  <thestinger> btw, you can make things like 'static' local variables in C/C++
2011-11-07T12:11:48  <caution> are you sure the main module is even changing it?
2011-11-07T12:12:09  <thestinger> when you use a dict/list as a default parameter, it's a reference to the same list in each call

2011-11-07T12:14:49  <RasmusL> and it's 0 during the whole match in module 2 :P
2011-11-07T12:14:54  <caution> are you redefining mybot in func.py?
2011-11-07T12:15:10  <thestinger> silly example: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/504191/
2011-11-07T12:15:19  <thestinger> that removes the need for almost any use case for a global variable
2011-11-07T12:15:34  <thestinger> almost every*
2011-11-07T12:16:45  <mcstar> thestinger: are trying to emulate a closure?
2011-11-07T12:17:28  <caution> a static variable inside a function
2011-11-07T12:17:32  <Antimony> static variables are only useful for testing
2011-11-07T12:17:38  <thestinger> well, you could also write that as a closure
2011-11-07T12:17:47  <Antimony> otherwise they are bad design practice
2011-11-07T12:18:22  <thestinger> so how do you do memoization? a global var?
2011-11-07T12:18:55  <caution> a class
2011-11-07T12:18:58  <mcstar> i think these are called accumulators
2011-11-07T12:19:01  <mcstar> or a counter
2011-11-07T12:19:06  <mcstar> yes, use a class
2011-11-07T12:19:22  <mcstar> a member holds the counter, if you call the class, it increments it, and returns it
2011-11-07T12:19:27  <RasmusL> derp this won't work at all :(
2011-11-07T12:19:43  <mcstar> you can do that, cant you? i mean call a class, but not "contruct" it
2011-11-07T12:19:49  <mcstar> i remember something like that
2011-11-07T12:20:24  <caution> make a simple test case of what you're trying and then when that works, investigate out how your real code is different
2011-11-07T12:20:42  <caution> s/out//
2011-11-07T12:20:46  <RasmusL> hmm
2011-11-07T12:20:50  <mcstar> so the problem is that he is trying to make this work across modules?
2011-11-07T12:20:56  <thestinger> it does work across modules
2011-11-07T12:21:07  <thestinger> RasmusL: try my simple test case, build from there
2011-11-07T12:21:28  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/ZCUS test.py http://sprunge.us/eIaR REPL session
2011-11-07T12:21:42  <caution> when you find out what's wrong, share it with me
2011-11-07T12:22:18  <mcstar> im gonna kill python
2011-11-07T12:23:08  <thestinger> function decorators are nicer for memoization anyway
2011-11-07T12:23:17  <thestinger> there's actually @functools.lru_cache in the standard lib

2011-11-07T12:26:08  <thestinger> caution: it's in the standard lib :P
2011-11-07T12:26:14  <thestinger> caution: http://docs.python.org/dev/library/functools.html
2011-11-07T12:26:33  <thestinger> with maxsize set to None, it's just a cache and doesn't do the LRU discarding
2011-11-07T12:26:47  <caution> New in version 3.2
2011-11-07T12:27:02  <caution> I still use <=2.6
2011-11-07T12:27:17  <thestinger> it's pure python
2011-11-07T12:27:31  <thestinger> it probably works in py2 if you copy the code to a module yourself

2011-11-07T12:32:47  <amstan> hey
2011-11-07T12:33:13  <McLeopold> I see the new Language Support forum (I still don't know what to call these? boards? sections? areas?)
2011-11-07T12:33:21  <amstan> forum
2011-11-07T12:33:24  <amstan> and plural is forums
2011-11-07T12:33:25  <caution> subforum?
2011-11-07T12:33:39  <McLeopold> okay, can you create the other forums so we can separate dev & tools
2011-11-07T12:34:11  <amstan> later today, i'm in a break and i have to go soon
2011-11-07T12:34:27  <McLeopold> oh, is it hard?
2011-11-07T12:34:39  <amstan> no, but i want to make sure it's done right
2011-11-07T12:34:52  <amstan> also.. i need to move a bunch of posts in the newly made forum
2011-11-07T12:35:12  <McLeopold> also,  my next big goal is to get the map gen constrainst correct, how much do you have in flux?
2011-11-07T12:35:47  <amstan> i don't have any constrait or validity checking yet
2011-11-07T12:36:19  <McLeopold> okay, I'm going to spruce up map.py, and make symmetric_map inherit and do proper checking
2011-11-07T12:36:32  <caution> do you get memory errors if you use too much memory or do you get dropped from the game?
2011-11-07T12:36:40  <amstan> McLeopold: can you work from my code?

2011-11-07T12:36:55  <amstan> amstan_mapgen i think
2011-11-07T12:37:02  <McLeopold> amstan: I'll try, I already have a bunch of changes that haven't been checked it
2011-11-07T12:37:14  <McLeopold> they've been there for weeks :(
2011-11-07T12:37:59  <caution> amstan: <Sqqby> Hi all, I did not find an answer to this in the FAQ: What will be done with all the info gathered by the challenge? What rights does the challenger grant by taking part? Will the winning algorithms be published and/or discussed publicly in any way? Where can I find more info on such issues?
2011-11-07T12:38:00  <amstan> the thing i like about my mapgen is that you just do map[pos]=LAND or WATER, and it symmetrically fills the other spots
2011-11-07T12:38:11  <amstan> and it supports negative and positive values too, modules automatically
2011-11-07T12:38:53  <amstan> caution: we don't have many legal things established
2011-11-07T12:39:08  <McLeopold> amstan: okay, that stuff should go in the map.py
2011-11-07T12:39:08  <amstan> caution: but from the past we didn't use the code for anything but for testing the bots
2011-11-07T12:39:15  <amstan> and we don't publish them either
2011-11-07T12:39:37  <amstan> McLeopold: please look at my code

2011-11-07T13:28:55  <Zannick> so within execute you call func(a, b, c) and that's the equivalent of self.someMethod(a, b, c)
2011-11-07T13:29:07  <Zannick> (which is the equivalent of MyBot.someMethod(self, a, b, c)
2011-11-07T13:29:09  <Zannick> )
2011-11-07T13:29:32  <Cali__> Will it automatically call, or can I give it a condition if passed in this way?
2011-11-07T13:30:07  <Cali__> func that is, when passed into execute, I only want to func to be run under a condition in execute

2011-11-07T13:55:24  <merk> i have a problem with compilation
2011-11-07T13:55:27  <merk> in c++ and windows
2011-11-07T13:55:29  <RasmusL> how many nodes is it reasonable to go through with A* in a turn?
2011-11-07T13:55:33  <merk> can someone help me?
2011-11-07T13:55:44  <RasmusL> i time out at around 40000 nodes in 1s
2011-11-07T13:56:01  <RasmusL> but idk if i need to cut down on the pathfinding or fix the algorithm :)
2011-11-07T13:56:25  <marijnfs> rasmus: 40000 /s sounds slow
2011-11-07T13:56:25  <RasmusL> merk what's the issue?

2011-11-07T13:59:30  <RasmusL> oh.. so the compilation is fine
2011-11-07T13:59:40  <RasmusL> that's all i can help with, i have no idea how to test the exe
2011-11-07T13:59:41  <merk1> yes i have the exe

2011-11-07T14:00:28  <RasmusL> hmm.. i bet someone here who uses c++ can help with that
2011-11-07T14:00:39  <marijnfs> you didnt change any code?
2011-11-07T14:00:56  <merk1> and also the bot in python starter package
2011-11-07T14:00:56  <merk1> ok thanks
2011-11-07T14:00:56  <merk1> no
2011-11-07T14:00:58  <merk1> i make no change
2011-11-07T14:01:00  <merk1> in code

2011-11-07T14:01:17  <marijnfs> python starter package crashes too?
2011-11-07T14:01:23  <merk1> yes
2011-11-07T14:01:37  <marijnfs> maybe it is one of the bots
2011-11-07T14:01:57  <marijnfs> meh doesnt sound likely

2011-11-07T14:27:38  <RasmusL> probably not very efficient.. but i think other parts of my bot are worse
2011-11-07T14:27:45  <RasmusL> so it doesn't hurt too bad :D
2011-11-07T14:28:45  <datachomper> that seems pretty good actually
2011-11-07T14:28:59  <datachomper> I used the A* algo in the networkx library and it was taking up to 10ms in some cases

2011-11-07T14:47:52  <Fluxid> https://github.com/berak/ants-tcp/blob/master/tcpserver.py#L470 yeah, great
2011-11-07T14:47:54  <RasmusL> they allqueue up at a bottleneck and go one at a time ^^
2011-11-07T14:48:12  <Fluxid> this server is sooooo unsafe
2011-11-07T14:48:47  <Fluxid> RasmusL: maybe try randomize them a little?
2011-11-07T14:49:02  <Fluxid> so if they can't go forward, the go to the sides
2011-11-07T14:49:13  <RasmusL> yeah
2011-11-07T14:49:23  <RasmusL> so far i don't even consider other ants in the pathfinding except not colliding
2011-11-07T14:49:29  <RasmusL> so that's probably why :)

2011-11-07T14:49:52  <thestinger> I keep track of ants that were blocked by my idle ants, and I go back and try to move those in a loop until I can't move them anymore (yay for brute force)
2011-11-07T14:50:05  <RasmusL> lol
2011-11-07T14:50:08  <thestinger> so that makes sure you get 1 ant through per turn (instead of leaving gaps)
2011-11-07T14:50:22  <thestinger> I still need to deal with chokepoints in a better way though

2011-11-07T15:05:10  <Minthos> I believe, although I'm not sure if it's within the rules of the contest, that you can do your gc cycle after your turn has ended but before the next one begins
2011-11-07T15:05:58  <Relax> knott: I believe you receive a SIGSTOP between turns, making any inter-turn calculation impossible

2011-11-07T15:09:03  <jcdny> there is no way to catch sigstop in any language.  feature of the OS
2011-11-07T15:09:04  <knott> thnx, i will check it out
2011-11-07T15:09:26  <Relax> knott: Or any other language. SIGSTOP cannot be trapped: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGSTOP
2011-11-07T15:09:37  <jcdny> you don't get sent a sigstop until after all the bots either send "go" or time out.
2011-11-07T15:10:51  <jcdny> so you could send your "go" then start the gc worst case is your garbage collection does not finish before you get a sigstop and it consumes some of the time on the next turn.
2011-11-07T15:13:37  <RasmusL> yay my bot survived the first 1000 turn battle without timeout ^^
2011-11-07T15:14:58  <knott> i dont get it guys. Why SIGSTOP raised when i just programmaticly call the GC?
2011-11-07T15:16:39  <Minthos> there should be no causality between the two

2011-11-07T15:51:26  <thestinger> change -1 to 1 for now

2011-11-07T15:51:57  <thestinger> I don't think the new version treats -1 as meaning "infinite games"

2011-11-07T15:52:09  <thestinger> but I've edited the tcpclient.py script myself so I dunno
2011-11-07T15:52:19  <ProperChaos> well, even without that parameter, or just a 1 I'm not doing any moves
2011-11-07T15:52:21  <mcstar> thestinger: it is working wo that parameter
2011-11-07T15:52:27  <ProperChaos> and cpu usage stays at 0% for my bot process

2011-11-07T16:52:56  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-07T16:53:17  <conor_f> consistency isn't that good for me :P although everyone I'm playing is over 1000 ranks ahead of me
2011-11-07T16:57:25  <conor_f> random question here, anyone here using linux and using an iPod with it?
2011-11-07T16:58:41  <datachomper> switched from [] to set() and reduced my bfs from 250ms to 25ms, still slow, bet getting there
2011-11-07T16:59:21  <thestinger> why do you need a set()?
2011-11-07T16:59:35  <thestinger> you don't need to keep track of visited nodes if you're sneaky with it
2011-11-07T16:59:43  <datachomper> thestinger: please elaborate
2011-11-07T16:59:52  <thestinger> you're planning on reusing the BFS for multiple ants right?
2011-11-07T16:59:59  <thestinger> like BFS from a target across the map, marking off distances
2011-11-07T17:00:09  <datachomper> sort of
2011-11-07T17:00:10  <thestinger> in a 2d list/array.array/numpy array or whatever
2011-11-07T17:00:25  <thestinger> well, if you mark off distances in a 2d array (for sending 100 ants to 1 target, etc.)
2011-11-07T17:00:32  <datachomper> thestinger: I'm just using the built-in python list-of-lists
2011-11-07T17:00:35  *** peyton <peyton!~peyton@rrdhcp-175-233.redrover.cornell.edu> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-07T17:00:58  <thestinger> yeah, a python list is a dynamic array of pointers, so that's fine
2011-11-07T17:01:20  <datachomper> thestinger: would I see an improvement if I switched to numpy multi-dimensional array?
2011-11-07T17:01:34  <thestinger> anyway, if you're marking off all the distances in a 2d array/whatever, you can just make sure the new node is a lower value than what you would put there
2011-11-07T17:01:42  <thestinger> so you don't need the visited set()
2011-11-07T17:02:16  <thestinger> datachomper: well, assuming it's a 2d array of integers (distances), you'll see an improvement with array.array (since it's a dynamic array of values, not pointers to them)
2011-11-07T17:02:31  <thestinger> numpy arrays are like array.array, but you can allocate them _much_ faster
2011-11-07T17:02:59  <thestinger> you should also reuse the same list/array rather than reallocating a new one
2011-11-07T17:03:15  <datachomper> Huh, I didn't think about marking my 2d array as I bfs'ed.
2011-11-07T17:03:43  <datachomper> Currently I do the entire bfs, then return a list of lists for each "distance" a list of nodes is from the target loc
2011-11-07T17:04:01  <thestinger> ah, I just mark off the distances in a 2d array of ints
2011-11-07T17:04:08  <thestinger> so my "paths" are just implicitly stored in that
2011-11-07T17:04:23  <thestinger> I just move an ant to a neighbour with a lower distance for pathfinding
2011-11-07T17:04:36  <datachomper> thestinger: So, you mark your target with some value, subtract something, then mark it's neighbors with a lower value, rinse repeat?
2011-11-07T17:04:49  <thestinger> well, I mark the target with 0
2011-11-07T17:04:59  <thestinger> then the 4 neighbouring nodes are 1
2011-11-07T17:05:01  <thestinger> then 2, etc.
2011-11-07T17:05:22  <thestinger> and instead of a visited set, I just make sure the new value I would be setting a cell to is lower than the old
2011-11-07T17:05:35  <thestinger> if it's lower, I set it and put the new neighbouring nodes onto the queue

2011-11-07T17:07:46  <thestinger> you can use numpy if you're using python2, and that should give you a decent speed boost for allocation or setting an entire 2d array back to a default value like -1
2011-11-07T17:08:04  <thestinger> iirc they don't have the python3 version of numpy on the server
2011-11-07T17:08:19  <datachomper> Oh cool, so I won't have to include it in my source?
2011-11-07T17:08:31  <thestinger> yeah, just 'import numpy'
2011-11-07T17:08:41  <thestinger> it's way to big to fit in the 2MB max size .zip
2011-11-07T17:09:03  <amstan> numpy also needs native code, so it's rather hard to include manually
2011-11-07T17:09:13  <thestinger> basically, numpy lets you avoid slow python for loops
2011-11-07T17:09:52  <thestinger> array.array is pretty much the same memory layout, but without nice ways to iterate/manipulate it

2011-11-07T17:42:07  <thestinger> I might increase it to ~50

2011-11-07T17:43:08  <Minthos> looking for food in explored areas
2011-11-07T17:43:21  <DeGi> thx :)
2011-11-07T17:43:31  <Minthos> I don't forage until turn 150
2011-11-07T17:44:11  <Minthos> but all my ants eat food of opportunity when they move to their exploration targets

2011-11-07T18:01:02  <mcstar> the tricky part is to alert an ant that will try to step to another ant's present location, that can no longer step to it's desired location, and hence must stay there

2011-11-07T19:24:34  <bergmark> twymer: The official servers have a turn time of 500ms and I think the tcp servers are several seconds, I'm sure to help with latency.

2011-11-07T20:01:15  <mcstar> i dont get it
2011-11-07T20:01:54  <Zannick> i think it was heisenberg
2011-11-07T20:02:04  <mcstar> who did what?
2011-11-07T20:02:11  <mcstar> i dot get the time reference
2011-11-07T20:04:47  <Zannick> heisenberg showed that you can't accurately measure both position and speed of an electron, iirc
2011-11-07T20:05:04  <mcstar> position and linear momentum
2011-11-07T20:05:17  <Zannick> and somewhat related is the quantum quirk of being unable to measure a result without changing it
2011-11-07T20:05:27  <mcstar> no
2011-11-07T20:05:31  <mcstar> not related
2011-11-07T20:05:46  <Zannick> okay, mr. smarty :P
2011-11-07T20:06:10  <mcstar> after all this i still dont get this time thing
2011-11-07T20:06:20  <mcstar> but nvm
2011-11-07T20:06:44  <Zannick> anyway, schrodinger's was a thought experiment where he postulated that the system was in every possible state at once until collapsed into one by observation
2011-11-07T20:06:52  <mcstar> Zannick: maybe he meant Plack's time
2011-11-07T20:06:53  <Zannick> i'm not sure what you mean by this time thing
2011-11-07T20:07:17  <Zannick> you mean < capa> I implemented a function to count the time, and now it get timed out at  first turn
2011-11-07T20:07:27  <mcstar> "shrodinger's time" or "heisenberg's time" in relation to timeouts
2011-11-07T20:07:37  <Zannick> measuring the time => timeout
2011-11-07T20:07:56  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-07T20:08:31  <mcstar> actually, you can measure time infinitely precisely

2011-11-07T20:52:13  <Wondering> If you time out, is it generally because you run out of memory? How much memory are we given
2011-11-07T20:52:34  <antimatroid> it's because you took longer than the turn limit
2011-11-07T20:52:41  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-07T20:52:44  <antimatroid> you should have at least 1gb of memory which is heaps
2011-11-07T20:52:54  <Wondering> I print the time left as I go, and I never seem to get below 900
2011-11-07T20:53:03  <a1k0n> datachomper1: i can't imagine using extra memory for an edge map would be advantageous unless it's expensive to look up squares
2011-11-07T20:53:18  <a1k0n> but it's certainly cheap to compute adjacent directions

2011-11-07T20:53:38  <a1k0n> possibly, yes... though you could just write code that generates the "edges" on the fly
2011-11-07T20:53:44  <mcstar> when i get water i delete pointers
2011-11-07T20:53:48  <Wondering>  logging.debug("Time Remaining After Move: %s"% (str(ants.time_remaining())))                 is how I check
2011-11-07T20:54:01  <antimatroid> i just added a vector of neighbour locations to each squrae and remove appropriate ones as i get water information
2011-11-07T20:54:14  <antimatroid> don't have to worry about checking if a location is water then either :P
2011-11-07T20:54:21  <Wondering> if that never seems I get low, so that is why I am asking about memory

2011-11-07T20:56:19  <a1k0n> wouldn't running out of memory result in 'crashed'?

2011-11-07T21:22:56  <treeform_> i either might be getting the "go" too late or server does not get my "go" in time

2011-11-07T21:31:50  <roflmao> so before even matchup
2011-11-07T21:31:55  <roflmao> 4 new lines â€” new bot completely rapes the old one

2011-11-07T21:46:47  <roflmao> basically I made a certain percentage of my ants aggressively attack hills
2011-11-07T21:46:56  <roflmao> that's their only purpose
2011-11-07T21:47:01  <roflmao> but in ACTUAL combat, they are very conservative
2011-11-07T21:47:03  <roflmao> causing a sort of moving wall
2011-11-07T21:47:12  <a1k0n> generally a good idea

2011-11-07T21:52:35  <bugnuts> a1k0n: are the bots you see playing on tcp and the main site representative of what they will look like for the final competition or do people keep their good ideas hidden?
2011-11-07T21:52:40  <hjax> hi
2011-11-07T21:53:34  <a1k0n> bugnuts: while i don't think anyone's hiding anything, i don't think the bots are representative of the final compo just because there's enough time between now and then for some decent innovations
2011-11-07T21:54:00  <bugnuts> it's more that what you see in the last week is basically what you are up against...
2011-11-07T21:54:02  <a1k0n> early on in the planetwars competition, i had a top-10 bot easily, and it took me like an hour to write
2011-11-07T21:54:08  <a1k0n> by the end i was down to 200 or so

2011-11-07T21:54:51  <bugnuts> I guess the real question is how different is the leader board a few days before the competition vs the final results...
2011-11-07T21:55:02  <a1k0n> oh.  not very different.
2011-11-07T21:55:13  <a1k0n> bayeselo/trueskill seem to work pretty well.
2011-11-07T21:56:03  <a1k0n> at least, that has been true in my vast experience of two other similar contests
2011-11-07T21:56:36  <bugnuts> cool.  It was partly since there are some things I know my bot would be susceptible to and you could code around it but if no one is using it then it's probably not worth it.
2011-11-07T21:57:27  <bugnuts> e.g. decoys; some bots are very aggressive and will chase 1 ant with an army of 10 but if no one is using them into the finals then its sort of safe to assume that I don't need to worry about it
2011-11-07T21:58:37  <a1k0n> oh, yeah, that's not a bad idea.  i don't think it's safe to assume anything at this point

2011-11-07T21:59:04  <bugnuts> I am not but also don't want to preempt things we just are not seeing.

2011-11-07T22:03:08  <a1k0n> but my combat code isn't good enough to do it anyway
2011-11-07T22:04:02  <bugnuts> yeah thats kind of where I am...
2011-11-07T22:04:45  <bugnuts> I realised what I was doing for gathering made for a very poor starting point for adding combat and had to rip things apart.
2011-11-07T22:04:46  <roflmao> I'm trying to get to where you guys are at :D
2011-11-07T22:04:59  <roflmao> then I'll worry about what you are worring about LOL

2011-11-07T22:06:35  <a1k0n> i kept picking off your defenders without anything to back it up
2011-11-07T22:07:11  <a1k0n> but i think your defense cost you expansion initally
2011-11-07T22:07:20  <roflmao> yes
2011-11-07T22:07:37  <roflmao> I'm seeing that too - because I wasn't lagging too far behind, but once you 'deadlocked' me in my base
2011-11-07T22:08:01  <a1k0n> your bot looks a lot like my first one did
2011-11-07T22:08:42  <a1k0n> heh you had a guy surrounded and you didn't press the advantage
2011-11-07T22:09:02  <bugnuts> Have you seen lordap - I think he wins the gathering game with a bullet.
2011-11-07T22:09:29  <roflmao> a1k0n: yep, because of my deadlocking code that's all screwy
2011-11-07T22:09:41  <roflmao> a1k0n: my combat bots are a little - too - conservative now

2011-11-07T22:10:20  <a1k0n> bugnuts: hm, i wonder if he's symmetry-aware
2011-11-07T22:10:52  <bugnuts> don't think so.  end distributions don't look like it
2011-11-07T22:10:56  <a1k0n> though his expansion rate doens't look too different from anyone else
2011-11-07T22:11:58  <bugnuts> he gets capped when people have decent combat but anyone without it and his better gathering just gets him big #s of ants.
2011-11-07T22:12:03  <roflmao> a1k0n: anything you'd recommend? :)
2011-11-07T22:13:18  <a1k0n> well... i guess prefer doing things sooner than later? :)
2011-11-07T22:13:46  <a1k0n> by deadlocking you mean your ants just sit there?
2011-11-07T22:13:51  <roflmao> yeah
2011-11-07T22:14:09  <a1k0n> yeah.  i dunno.  it's hard, because both ants have to act in concert for it not to be a loss
2011-11-07T22:14:10  <roflmao> which is all horribly wrong when i have 5 ants that should be gathering food but they are sitting there because of one stupid enemy ant in the middle
2011-11-07T22:14:18  <a1k0n> so if you optimize each ant independently you get stuck
2011-11-07T22:14:37  <a1k0n> ...unless you have some way to assume the other guy will do the right thing
2011-11-07T22:14:57  <roflmao> yes
2011-11-07T22:15:01  <a1k0n> i dunno, assign a probability to them going after you and flip a coin?
2011-11-07T22:15:15  <roflmao> that's actually not a bad idea

2011-11-07T22:20:53  <bugnuts> but since I seed the map with exploration points it only happens when I have seen the entire map.

2011-11-07T22:22:16  <roflmao> I have a system for exploration that I think works relatively well
2011-11-07T22:22:31  <roflmao> I seed map with exploration points like you, but I assign a fixed percentage of my ants to exploration
2011-11-07T22:22:36  <roflmao> that percentage decreases as I get more ants
2011-11-07T22:22:43  <roflmao> so early game it's mostly food and exploration
2011-11-07T22:22:54  <roflmao> as I gain critical mass of ants, the percentage of exploration decreases and combat increases
2011-11-07T22:23:16  <bugnuts> yeah the seeding explore points is not as adaptive as I would like but I need to focus more on getting combat in before I address it.

2011-11-07T22:31:03  <janzert> ?
2011-11-07T22:31:19  <amstan> this C guy is really insistent: http://aichallenge.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=1797
2011-11-07T22:31:47  <janzert> we could just tell him no then ;)
2011-11-07T22:32:01  <janzert> I was looking into it a little bit earlier today
2011-11-07T22:32:02  <amstan> he also found a memory leak in the C starter(which flag got fixed), and suggested some changes to the makefile
2011-11-07T22:32:10  <janzert> hadn't made up my mind yes
2011-11-07T22:32:13  <janzert> yet even
2011-11-07T22:32:48  <janzert> it's probably going to be no though
2011-11-07T22:33:08  <amstan> why not?
2011-11-07T22:33:19  <amstan> i always compile my code with c99
2011-11-07T22:33:24  <janzert> implicit int declaration goes away which has a fair chance of breaking current (poorly) written code
2011-11-07T22:34:20  <janzert> if I get a chance I'm going to implement a test that would compile and test every current submission with the change to see if it breaks

2011-11-07T22:35:41  <amstan> or the starter package?
2011-11-07T22:35:53  <janzert> poorly as in you really shouldn't be using an implicit int declaration anyway
2011-11-07T22:36:00  <janzert> I hope the starter doesn't

2011-11-07T22:36:22  <roflmao> :P
2011-11-07T22:36:22  <amstan> you really think it's going to break things so bad?
2011-11-07T22:36:41  <_flag> You could add another extension specifically for C99 code (basically for one person)
2011-11-07T22:36:44  <janzert> I don't know but I'm pretty committed to not breaking current submissions
2011-11-07T22:36:53  <amstan> _flag: it's really a hassle to do these things
2011-11-07T22:36:57  <janzert> and since I don't know :)
2011-11-07T22:37:24  <janzert> yeah I really don't want to keep proliferating minor language version differences
2011-11-07T22:37:27  <amstan> janzert: i just don't think it should be our job to avoid breaking fragile code
2011-11-07T22:38:09  <janzert> if we accept a submission we should if at all possible not then make changes that break it
2011-11-07T22:38:46  <janzert> if it was beta I'd make the change for sure
2011-11-07T22:39:11  <amstan> you're affraid about new workers breaking the current submissions?
2011-11-07T22:39:36  <amstan> what if no bots actually get broken?
2011-11-07T22:39:38  <janzert> yes, or current workers that haven't happened to get that submission yet
2011-11-07T22:39:50  <janzert> see the test I mentioned above :)
2011-11-07T22:39:58  <amstan> oh.. ic

2011-11-07T22:40:18  <amstan> i was imagining something more complicated.. like compiler script trying with and without c99 and taking the one which worked
2011-11-07T22:40:26  <amstan> yeah, ok
2011-11-07T22:40:45  <amstan> janzert: ok.. i suggest we just tell that guy exactly what we're doing

2011-11-07T23:10:51  <andar> he just needed some friends

2011-11-07T23:20:42  <califax> if you do:  print('go') in do_turn(self, ants) in python, does it end your turn?

2011-11-07T23:22:18  <andar> califax, you're better off just returning from do_turn
2011-11-07T23:22:39  <andar> because ants.finish_turn() will run after that and it prints 'go' out as well

2011-11-07T23:23:59  <califax> andar: Thank you, I am doing this because my bot times out and I am trying to get it to not time out. Doing print('go') causes me to time out even sooner than without it if it is the first line in my do_turn method

2011-11-07T23:24:32  <andar> i don't know how it all works.. but maybe it's a problem with writing 'go' out twice in row?
2011-11-07T23:24:38  <andar> just try 'return' instead

2011-11-07T23:36:32  <roflmao> is fluxid stuck?
2011-11-07T23:37:47  <thestinger> it happens :), the tcp server is buggy
2011-11-07T23:38:18  <thestinger> it leaks sockets and threads
2011-11-07T23:38:32  <thestinger> and it can get stuck if someone opens a connection and never sends something
2011-11-07T23:39:03  <roflmao> (oooops, I'm a culprit of that)
2011-11-07T23:39:07  <roflmao> (i thought my bot would just timeout)
2011-11-07T23:39:08  <thestinger> well, one of my bots is playing a game still
2011-11-07T23:39:14  <roflmao> yea it started
2011-11-07T23:39:24  <thestinger> well, it would be hard to do it by accident
2011-11-07T23:39:30  <thestinger> if you ctrl-c you close the socket

2011-11-07T23:41:11  <andar> i'm surprised no one has written a better tcpserver.. it shouldn't be very difficult

2011-11-07T23:43:45  <Zaphus> Hey guys, can you enter comments in your bot commands (with   # comment or something like that) - it's not in the game spec but ants.py looks like it handles it (not intending the comments to get to the live server, but just checking to be safe)
2011-11-07T23:44:15  <andar> you can comment your code..
2011-11-07T23:45:05  <Zaphus> comment my code ?  pigs might fly!      but can I put comments in my command stream ?
2011-11-07T23:45:33  <andar> you're just looking for a way to print out some debug info?
2011-11-07T23:46:28  <andar> take a look at some of the example bots.. some of them use the included logutil.py to set up a logger you can use to print out debug info without interrupting the command stream
2011-11-07T23:46:50  <andar> or you could just use the python logging module directly
2011-11-07T23:47:10  <Zaphus> sort of, but I want it in the onscreen stream that I see when running on the TCP server.
2011-11-07T23:47:15  <andar> yes
2011-11-07T23:47:20  <andar> that will do it

2011-11-07T23:48:56  <Zaphus> logutil.py sounds good...   if only I used Python for my bot and not some other antiquated language :-)
2011-11-07T23:49:18  <nickjohnson> You should just be able to write to stderr
2011-11-07T23:49:27  <nickjohnson> Or use your language's logging library that does that for you
