2010-09-22T00:01:28  <Zeiris> Has anyone found the problem with PlayGame-1.2.jar, that causes game clients not work as intended yet?
2010-09-22T00:01:46  <Zeiris> (Where the bot times out, despite providing ostensibly correct outputs/not crashing on inputs.)

2010-09-22T00:25:18  <Snowplan> I love my new bot even though he fails.  Imma call him the hammer
2010-09-22T00:30:26  <Snowplan> "The Hammer"
2010-09-22T00:30:27  <antimatroid1> Arekku made some silly moves in that game
2010-09-22T00:36:38  <Janzert> here's an example of a game that almost certainly would have changed the result if it went a little longer http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4630315
2010-09-22T00:38:53  <antimatroid1> yep, i wish it had a decreasing band of ship difference allowed
2010-09-22T00:39:05  <antimatroid1> once it goes outside the band the game is declared and the band gets smaller as a game progresses
2010-09-22T00:39:33  <Snowplan> disagree
2010-09-22T00:39:43  <antimatroid1> although i would never reduce it to 1 ship difference decides, i'd say if you cant get over 1.1 of their ships or whatever, it's a draw
2010-09-22T00:39:50  <antimatroid1> Snowplan: why?
2010-09-22T00:40:18  <Janzert> even just declaring a tie if the same side doesn't have both groth rate and number of ships would be better than the current method
2010-09-22T00:40:27  <Snowplan> vulnerability : mass
2010-09-22T00:41:18  <antimatroid1> it's more to see bots battle than to have both trying to maximise ships at turn 200
2010-09-22T00:41:22  <antimatroid1> more fun*

2010-09-22T01:35:31  <antimatroid1> sigh: i've almost got you on the main rankings ;)
2010-09-22T01:35:51  <antimatroid1> we need an au 1st and 2nd finish
2010-09-22T01:36:04  <drewrobb> waiting for main ranking is so painful
2010-09-22T01:36:10  <sigh> well, you already beat my bot on tcp, so I'm not surprised :P
2010-09-22T01:36:12  <antimatroid1> tell me about it
2010-09-22T01:36:25  <antimatroid1> but hopefully they'll have more servers soon
2010-09-22T01:36:26  <sigh> drewrobb: where are you on the main ranking?
2010-09-22T01:36:30  <drewrobb> there is also major leapfrogging going on
2010-09-22T01:36:31  <antimatroid1> they've been talking about it on the mailing list
2010-09-22T01:36:39  <drewrobb> i just uploaded today, only 5 games
2010-09-22T01:36:53  <drewrobb> have they banned starter bots?
2010-09-22T01:37:00  <antimatroid1> i've had 15, uploaded 3 days or so ago
2010-09-22T01:37:04  <antimatroid1> might have been 2 and a half
2010-09-22T01:37:10  <antimatroid1> don't think so
2010-09-22T01:37:26  <sigh> drewrobb: I don't think they will ban starters
2010-09-22T01:37:34  <antimatroid1> sigh: they did last time
2010-09-22T01:37:45  <sigh> oh ok
2010-09-22T01:37:52  <antimatroid1> not really a ban, just disabled those bots
2010-09-22T01:38:14  <drewrobb> haha, imagine if they banned accounts for uploading starters
2010-09-22T01:38:24  <sigh> I know what you meant :P
2010-09-22T01:38:37  <antimatroid1> yeah, especially since they tell people to do that first aha
2010-09-22T01:38:46  <sigh> well, I've heard talk of limiting them to a certain amount of games and stuff, but not outright stop them from playing
2010-09-22T01:39:04  <sigh> yeah, it would be silly to tell them to upload a bot, and then not see any games
2010-09-22T01:39:07  <antimatroid1> yeah i think that'd be best, or first upload from each account gets max 5 gams?
2010-09-22T01:39:11  <drewrobb> they could bias resources to higher ranked bots
2010-09-22T01:39:27  <antimatroid1> drewrobb: they would discourage poorer competitors from competing
2010-09-22T01:40:24  <antimatroid1> arekku dropped back to 15th
2010-09-22T01:40:26  <drewrobb> hmmm, don't they already give games based on ELO uncertainty?
2010-09-22T01:40:31  <antimatroid1> thanks to sigh too :D
2010-09-22T01:40:47  <drewrobb> so in some way they already bias resources to the top and very bottom
2010-09-22T01:40:56  <sigh> antimatroid1: haha
2010-09-22T01:41:06  <jmcarthur> drewrobb: no they don't base it on uncertainty, just on mean estimated rank
2010-09-22T01:41:32  <jmcarthur> well, they decide to schedule a bot for a game based on time since it last played a game
2010-09-22T01:41:41  <jmcarthur> and which bot to match with based on rank
2010-09-22T01:41:46  <antimatroid1> i think it'd be nice if bots got 3 or 4 games right away when uploading rather than 1
2010-09-22T01:41:58  <antimatroid1> but server is struggling so hard atm
2010-09-22T01:42:04  <drewrobb> ahh
2010-09-22T01:42:07  <sigh> awesome, it wasn't a dodgy win either, my bot played well in that game
2010-09-22T01:42:14  <jmcarthur> i think the artificial bias for new bots does more harm than good, myself
2010-09-22T01:42:38  <antimatroid1> i think mines got to the point that i've thrown so many things in my original intentions no longer work in all cases
2010-09-22T01:42:39  <jmcarthur> sure, you get that first game, but then everybody else is sitting around with 3 games waiting for their chances
2010-09-22T01:42:44  <drewrobb> i'm completely content with dhartmei's server, i just wish more people would consistently play there
2010-09-22T01:43:00  <antimatroid1> yeah same, but it's nice for bragging rights on official rankings
2010-09-22T01:43:29  <sigh> I play on tcp until I figure out why my bot is crap and then take it down :)
2010-09-22T01:43:38  <sigh> repeat after I improve it
2010-09-22T01:44:15  <antimatroid1> yeah i do stuff like that, although tend to just throw a copy of .exe in a tcp folder and leave it running for at least 20 games
2010-09-22T01:44:20  <antimatroid1> whilst upating errors as it plays
2010-09-22T01:44:30  <antimatroid1> then when it gets too messy, i go through and clean everything up
2010-09-22T01:44:44  <antimatroid1> i'm terrible at developing clean code, but oh well
2010-09-22T01:46:01  <drewrobb> yeah, my usual night is make a bunch of changes, find out one of them introduces a bug, and then undo and lose half of the good changes finding the bug
2010-09-22T01:46:25  <sigh> version control is your friend :)
2010-09-22T01:46:44  <drewrobb> using it, i'm just not diligent enough
2010-09-22T01:47:03  <sigh> yeah, that can be a problem
2010-09-22T01:47:12  <antimatroid1> my version control consists of periodically zipping my bot and throwing that into a folder aha
2010-09-22T01:47:24  <sigh> for me, I feel unclean if stuff isn't checked it
2010-09-22T01:47:36  <sigh> antimatroid1: seriously get a proper vcs
2010-09-22T01:47:51  <antimatroid1> i use codeblocks to write stuff/compile etc.
2010-09-22T01:47:59  <antimatroid1> seems to do the job
2010-09-22T01:48:08  <drewrobb> my test versions are always filled with debug statements, and then i don't want to check in that messy code
2010-09-22T01:48:30  <jmcarthur> just do an interactive checkin
2010-09-22T01:48:43  <jmcarthur> say which lines you do and don't want to check in, i mean
2010-09-22T01:49:10  <antimatroid1> i just have a function ostream& operator<<(ostream &o, const PlanetWars &pw); which i use to output the game each move to a file, then i can look in there if stuff is going wrong
2010-09-22T01:49:12  <drewrobb> hmm, i wonder if there is a way to regex ignore lines?
2010-09-22T01:49:24  <jmcarthur> possibly
2010-09-22T01:49:29  <drewrobb> yeah, i could just not check in anything with <<
2010-09-22T01:49:39  <jmcarthur> ha
2010-09-22T01:49:59  <dufflebunk> grep -v
2010-09-22T01:56:32  <antimatroid1> deepblue seems to have a new bot
2010-09-22T01:56:37  <contestbot> Top 10 players: kcm1700(3498), McLeopold(3476), dmj111(3438), adumlah(3369), EBraun(3321), montanalow(3307), Tracer(3248), goldman(3235), Loks1982(3230), paulus(3229)
2010-09-22T01:58:37  <jmcarthur> i kind of wish that method 2 had been the winner of the "great debate on three-way battles" now. it seemed the most complex at the time, but now i think it would have been a lot simpler for my bot
2010-09-22T01:58:55  <jmcarthur> (the one where the players fight each other before fighting neutral)
2010-09-22T01:59:45  <antimatroid1> i like the way it's done now
2010-09-22T01:59:49  <antimatroid1> it works
2010-09-22T02:00:11  <jmcarthur> it would have meant that i could have merged all fleets that arrive at a planet at the same time rather than having to wait until the end
2010-09-22T02:00:27  <jmcarthur> that is, during transit
2010-09-22T02:00:28  <antimatroid1> i do that now
2010-09-22T02:00:33  <antimatroid1> but store full ship amounts
2010-09-22T02:00:44  <antimatroid1> like player 1 has this and player 2 has that
2010-09-22T02:00:50  <jmcarthur> right, that's not whati mean
2010-09-22T02:00:52  <jmcarthur> *what i
2010-09-22T02:01:00  <jmcarthur> i mean the battle could have been partly resolved in advance
2010-09-22T02:01:21  <antimatroid1> yeah, just store ship amounts then generate expected future states
2010-09-22T02:01:24  <sigh> jmcarthur: I agree
2010-09-22T02:01:36  <antimatroid1> it still takes next to no time
2010-09-22T02:01:49  <sigh> jmcarthur: that's the reason why I said that handling the simulation was messy
2010-09-22T02:01:58  <jmcarthur> well, in my code in particular, it would have been a godsend
2010-09-22T02:02:08  <jmcarthur> to be able to merge opposing fleets
2010-09-22T02:02:10  <antimatroid1> fair enough, it really doesn't bother me
2010-09-22T02:02:25  <antimatroid1> i would love to know min distance between planets though
2010-09-22T02:02:25  <jmcarthur> sigh: the battle itself is very simple at least
2010-09-22T02:02:42  <sigh> as a once of event, yes
2010-09-22T02:03:19  <jmcarthur> the main reason i disliked method 2 was that it would have been a huge discouragement to expansion and aggression
2010-09-22T02:03:35  <sigh> why?
2010-09-22T02:03:44  <antimatroid1> it's already ingrained in winning
2010-09-22T02:03:44  <jmcarthur> because neutral would have been much stronger
2010-09-22T02:03:53  <antimatroid1> so might have made it better possibly
2010-09-22T02:04:33  <antimatroid1> no way it's getting changed now anyway
2010-09-22T02:04:49  <jmcarthur> yeah i'm not proposing that we do whatsoever
2010-09-22T02:05:02  <jmcarthur> i don't regret the decision, i just would have voted differently in restrospect
2010-09-22T02:06:35  <drewrobb> woo, my upload finally got enough games to crack the top 100

2010-09-22T02:12:52  <antimatroid1> perhaps go on a murdering rampage under the guise of rage bot
2010-09-22T02:13:04  <drewrobb> you didn't have timeout protection?
2010-09-22T02:13:08  <antimatroid1> we did
2010-09-22T02:13:24  <antimatroid1> i still don't know if we fucked up or the server fucked up, didn't even get to see the game that caused it
2010-09-22T02:13:37  <antimatroid1> up until it happened i assumed that was just a loss of game, first time it happened on main server :|
2010-09-22T02:13:57  <antimatroid1> but wasn't lots of people bitching about it, so have to assume it was our fault
2010-09-22T02:14:14  <antimatroid1> i still think it's an unecessarily strict rule
2010-09-22T02:14:14  <sigh> hmmm... I should implement some timeout protection :S
2010-09-22T02:14:23  <drewrobb> yeah that is tragic
2010-09-22T02:14:24  <jmcarthur> the main server had all sorts of issues relating to timeouts
2010-09-22T02:14:36  <jmcarthur> i feel like a lot of people were screwed over by it
2010-09-22T02:14:47  <antimatroid1> a bot that always times out should really have on average shorter games than other bots
2010-09-22T02:14:49  <sigh> was it wall clock then as well?
2010-09-22T02:14:52  <antimatroid1> and you could set a max number of timeouts
2010-09-22T02:14:52  <jmcarthur> yes
2010-09-22T02:15:26  <sigh> jmcarthur: was that "yes" for me?
2010-09-22T02:15:29  <jmcarthur> yes
2010-09-22T02:15:32  <sigh> :)
2010-09-22T02:15:43  <antimatroid1> i am being absolutely maticulous about my timer this time though, there is no way i can fail to check in time
2010-09-22T02:16:03  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i was sure of that too, but my bot was still DQed a *ton* during testing
2010-09-22T02:16:18  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i ended up submitting it with a self-imposed 0.5s time limit, iirc
2010-09-22T02:16:27  <jmcarthur> and was still crossing my fingers about it
2010-09-22T02:16:39  <antimatroid1> yeah, i don't like that, i have it set at 0.9 max atm
2010-09-22T02:16:41  <jmcarthur> because in testing i had even had problems with a self-imposed 0.1s time limit :\
2010-09-22T02:16:44  <drewrobb> i remember there was the issue of cpu time versus user time
2010-09-22T02:16:56  <jmcarthur> and it's still an issue, IMO
2010-09-22T02:17:17  <drewrobb> you guys were using the correct one and still had problems?
2010-09-22T02:17:26  <jmcarthur> i was using SIGALRM
2010-09-22T02:17:35  <jmcarthur> wall clock time
2010-09-22T02:17:42  <jmcarthur> still problems
2010-09-22T02:17:49  <drewrobb> i had mine set to stop itself at 0.99sec, and never had issues
2010-09-22T02:17:57  <antimatroid1> i'm using a timer based off start time and current time, is that a bad idea?
2010-09-22T02:18:03  <jmcarthur> also, even when my bot had a much higher limit imposed on it, it still behaved in a way that led me to believe it was only getting like 0.1s of cpu time
2010-09-22T02:18:45  <antimatroid1> i assume the resources on my computer are much shitter than i'll get on the server, so if it works here it'll work there
2010-09-22T02:18:58  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't assume anything like that
2010-09-22T02:19:01  <jmcarthur> the server is pretty shitty
2010-09-22T02:19:07  <sigh> hmm... was there any discussion on the best way to do timings? I was going to use SIGALRM too, but jmcarthur makes me unsure
2010-09-22T02:19:19  <jmcarthur> sigh: SIGALRM was the best timer i found
2010-09-22T02:19:27  <sigh> ok, thank you!
2010-09-22T02:19:46  * antimatroid1 runs to google
2010-09-22T02:19:55  <jmcarthur> it also has the advantage that *if* we manage to switch to cpu time it's easy to switch SIGALRM over to that
2010-09-22T02:20:01  <sigh> yeah :)
2010-09-22T02:20:47  <sigh> were you doing anything more sophisticated than just outputing "go" in the signal handler?
2010-09-22T02:21:12  <jmcarthur> in the tron contest there wasn't even a "go". you just sent your command
2010-09-22T02:21:21  <sigh> oh, right
2010-09-22T02:21:28  <sigh> (sorry, I wasn't part of that contest)
2010-09-22T02:21:28  <jmcarthur> i did do some fancy stuff after determining that it didn't slow anything down
2010-09-22T02:22:05  <Zannick> what about google?

2010-09-22T02:22:21  <jmcarthur> i had a (green) worker thread, an IO thread, and a thread that was spawned automatically for signal handling. the worker ran basically constantly and the signal and IO threads would occasionally interrupt it
2010-09-22T02:22:30  <sigh> how many matroids are there? o_O
2010-09-22T02:22:44  <sigh> jmcarthur: threads aren't allowed?

2010-09-22T02:23:40  <sigh> ah, ok
2010-09-22T02:23:45  <sigh> yeah, that makes sense
2010-09-22T02:24:03  <jmcarthur> anyway, it was nice because i could process even while waiting for I/O
2010-09-22T02:25:11  <jmcarthur> the version that did that had a higher win rate than the one that didn't, at least
2010-09-22T02:25:44  <sigh> interesting... though I'm far from doing anything that involved
2010-09-22T02:25:45  <jmcarthur> okay, i'm going to dream about array processing tonight

2010-09-22T02:36:32  <sigh> bartwe: but you have to get pairs of games at the same time

2010-09-22T02:38:44  <McLeopold> I'm working on it.  Not sure.
2010-09-22T02:39:01  <McLeopold> I keep finding "bugs" that make my first one really good.
2010-09-22T02:39:22  <antimatroid1> the joys of ai writing
2010-09-22T02:39:28  <McLeopold> I'm in the middle of a total rewrite.
2010-09-22T02:39:28  <antimatroid1> errors being smarter than you
2010-09-22T02:40:26  <McLeopold> I really thought Arekku was going to kick me ass.  I was totaly wrong.
2010-09-22T02:40:34  <antimatroid1> java is surging, 8-11
2010-09-22T02:40:46  <antimatroid1> i don't think it looks as smart as some of you think
2010-09-22T02:40:54  <antimatroid1> it made some stupid moves against you
2010-09-22T02:41:07  <antimatroid1> like sending 2 fleets to claim a fairly easily claimable 69 ship neutral planet
2010-09-22T02:41:09  <McLeopold> Maybe it was just a map that favors my style.
2010-09-22T02:41:34  <antimatroid1> 68**
2010-09-22T02:41:50  <antimatroid1> did similar things a few times
2010-09-22T02:42:06  <McLeopold> What turn was that?
2010-09-22T02:42:20  <antimatroid1> around 66
2010-09-22T02:42:30  <antimatroid1> another one happened a bit before it to a planet just to the left
2010-09-22T02:42:44  <antimatroid1> it's the 68 near centre in bottom left quadrant
2010-09-22T02:42:52  <McLeopold> Those were my fleets...
2010-09-22T02:42:56  <antimatroid1> oh wait, that was you :P
2010-09-22T02:43:20  <antimatroid1> cough fix that :P cough
2010-09-22T02:43:43  <McLeopold> Yeah, I fix that, then I can't beat myself.  This is what I dealing with.

2010-09-22T02:45:20  <antimatroid1> can't lose position bro
2010-09-22T02:45:24  <antimatroid1> that's the end
2010-09-22T02:45:51  <antimatroid1> damn i finally got a game and lost aha
2010-09-22T02:46:07  <McLeopold> what's your bots name
2010-09-22T02:46:19  <antimatroid1> youwillfail
2010-09-22T02:46:52  <antimatroid1> ah that loss is alright, the bot has gone to favouring attacking too early which is a known error
2010-09-22T02:46:59  <antimatroid1> and he sucks at attacking once he can win too
2010-09-22T02:46:59  <antimatroid1> aha
2010-09-22T02:47:34  <McLeopold> Did you see that tiny little fleet of 6 sneek behind you?

2010-09-22T02:50:15  <antimatroid1> yeah, i think i messed things up when i changed to estimating nearest enemies

2010-09-22T05:42:20  <dufflebunk> Theudas: I don't think the tcp server sends your program to the server. It runs the program locally.
2010-09-22T05:42:59  <dufflebunk> So I think so long as your local java can run the command you give it, then you should be good. Which likely means you'll need a jar or compiled classes

2010-09-22T07:08:34  <Zaphus> I suspect there's a bug in my code:  I lost this match :-)   http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4637181    wish I knew if it was a timeout or an illegal move :-)

2010-09-22T07:19:21  <retybok> Zaphus: you should play on the TCP server, it tells you whether it's a timeout or an invalid command
2010-09-22T07:20:24  <Zaphus> retybok:  Yes, it does when I'm there to run it, but even though the real server only runs one game every two or more hours, it can do it while I'm at work and I dont need to leave a PC connected.  It also has more variety in opponents :-)
2010-09-22T07:21:18  <Zaphus> retybok: in theory I could feed the playback data into the game engine so that it prompts me for that exact turn again and I could see if it were an illegal turn
2010-09-22T07:21:41  <Naktibalda> I think that you play against more opponents in TCP  then in real server :)
2010-09-22T07:22:15  <sigh> Zaphus: if you want to do that there is a python script on the forums to parse the playback string
2010-09-22T07:23:21  <Zaphus> naktibalda:  true, but usually the same opponents over and over again, I like seeing these stranger opponents as well - especially since I'm in Australia so half the planet is asleep when I want to play :-)
2010-09-22T07:24:31  <Zaphus> sigh: thanks, will take a look - just going through my code and making it more solid anyway, it died immediately after the final planet was taken so the opponetn had zero and there were no other planets left, so I'm guessing illegal turn
2010-09-22T07:25:09  <Zaphus> sigh:  great progress on your bot by the way, I'm struggling to get into the top 20 to get three aussies up there!
2010-09-22T07:25:29  <sigh> :)
2010-09-22T07:25:40  <sigh> I'm about to release a new bot
2010-09-22T07:25:52  <antimatroid> Zaphus: come on, you're letting the team down ;)
2010-09-22T07:26:02  <antimatroid> sigh: i'm working on a new one now
2010-09-22T07:26:14  <sigh> I've got my new one out on tcp atm
2010-09-22T07:26:28  <sigh> fixes up a huge bug in my simulation code
2010-09-22T07:26:37  <antimatroid> nice, i'm probably a few hours away
2010-09-22T07:26:46  <antimatroid> restructuring lots and fixing up my decisions
2010-09-22T07:26:52  <Zaphus> antimatroid: I'm playing around with a new idea, it's got a few holes in it.  I really need to build a bot like the ones at the top so I can do some offline testing
2010-09-22T07:27:31  <Zaphus> maybe we should all upload new bots at midnight tonight (Aussie east coast time) :-)
2010-09-22T07:27:44  <antimatroid> i'll see how i'm going
2010-09-22T07:27:51  * antimatroid gets back to work
2010-09-22T07:28:05  <antimatroid> i might test a few things incrementally before then anyway
2010-09-22T07:28:11  <antimatroid> but i'll try to hit midnight for you :P
2010-09-22T07:28:16  <antimatroid> it's 9 21pm for me right now
2010-09-22T07:31:02  <antimatroid> this new strategy will either flop really badly or be a decent improvement
2010-09-22T07:31:31  <Zaphus> same time here, Melbourne.  you're in Tassie, right ?   Sigh, where are you ?
2010-09-22T07:31:41  <sigh> Melbourne
2010-09-22T07:31:59  <FlagCapper> Are there any admins here who could tell me why my bot keeps losing randomly in the middle of games of the main server but does fine on the tcp server?

2010-09-22T07:33:51  <FlagCapper> :)
2010-09-22T07:34:29  <FlagCapper> I seem to lose to you fairly consistently
2010-09-22T07:35:09  <boegel> this seems relevant: http://games.slashdot.org/story/10/09/22/014255/Elo-Chess-Rating-System-Topped-By-Proposed-Replacements?from=rss
2010-09-22T07:35:14  <sigh> you got me twice :P
2010-09-22T07:35:24  <FlagCapper> True :P
2010-09-22T07:36:13  <FlagCapper> I have five loops of the tcp server running all the time so I play a lot of games, which is probably why you play me so much.
2010-09-22T07:36:29  <sigh> ahhh
2010-09-22T07:36:39  <sigh> are they all the same bot?
2010-09-22T07:36:47  <FlagCapper> At the moment, yes.
2010-09-22T07:36:58  <FlagCapper> When I test changes I make a few of them a different bot.
2010-09-22T07:37:02  <FlagCapper> And it's easy to compare the two.
2010-09-22T07:37:13  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-22T07:38:22  <FlagCapper> Unfortunately my bot just quits randomly on the main server at around 50 moves, and I have no idea why.
2010-09-22T07:38:29  <sigh> ah :(
2010-09-22T07:38:37  <sigh> FlagCapper: I've got to thank you, that first loss was quite instructive
2010-09-22T07:38:48  <FlagCapper> no problem :)
2010-09-22T07:39:07  <sigh> my planet selection was quite crap compared to yours... currently thinking about how to mitigate that :)
2010-09-22T07:39:28  <FlagCapper> I think the only problem I have right now is my bot doesn't defend my planets properly.
2010-09-22T07:40:17  <FlagCapper> If someone only sends num_ships + 1 it just ignores it and loses the planet.
2010-09-22T07:41:00  <sigh> FlagCapper: yeah... for example this game should have been in the bag for you: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=98350
2010-09-22T07:41:41  <FlagCapper> Yeah, and then you got your home planet back.
2010-09-22T07:41:57  <FlagCapper> Anyway, it should be a simple fix.
2010-09-22T07:42:02  <sigh> yeah :)
2010-09-22T07:42:27  <sigh> meanwhile, I need to turn the aggression back down a notch... all out on the first turn is not so good :P
2010-09-22T07:42:45  <FlagCapper> ;)
2010-09-22T07:43:03  <Zaphus> giving my tweaked version a run on the server.
2010-09-22T07:43:07  <Zaphus> tcp that is
2010-09-22T07:44:34  <bartwe> you guys are too good :)
2010-09-22T07:44:37  <Zaphus> Just jumped in front of sigh on the Tcp server - 4 games 4 wins... it's downhill from here
2010-09-22T07:45:14  <bartwe> i also finally started beating sigh-2

2010-09-22T07:54:05  <bartwe> .8 was in the top 5 for a while
2010-09-22T07:54:17  <bartwe> its getting very competative at the top
2010-09-22T07:54:23  <Zaphus> I was 2nd about 10 minutes ago :-)
2010-09-22T07:54:37  <Zaphus> 9th now, it never lasts
2010-09-22T07:54:39  <retybok> I still think a human with enough time would defeat most if not all the bots, though
2010-09-22T07:54:48  <retybok> which means there is margin for improvement
2010-09-22T07:54:49  <bartwe> Zaphus: try again with 10+ games with atleast 4 different competitors
2010-09-22T07:55:09  <bartwe> retybok: removing the time limit would also improve some of the bots
2010-09-22T07:55:20  <bartwe> anyways, that is my tactic
2010-09-22T07:55:27  <bartwe> watching replays, deciding on bad moves
2010-09-22T07:55:31  <Zaphus> bartwe:  no, I liked 4 games - gave me a better result :-)
2010-09-22T07:55:45  <bartwe> going back into that state in the bot and tweaking the cost function
2010-09-22T07:56:00  <retybok> Sure, but if you take chess for example, any computer with a 1 second thinking time can destroy 99% of humans. Granted, it took decades to arrive at this point :)
2010-09-22T07:56:07  <sigh> bartwe: finally scraped a win from you: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=98637

2010-09-22T07:59:54  <sigh> yeah, that was nerve-wracking to watch
2010-09-22T08:00:36  <bartwe> i guess mine should have invested in the 88 neutral
2010-09-22T08:01:07  <bartwe> no immediatly obvious stupid moves
2010-09-22T08:01:55  <sigh> yeah, that 88-neutral is a tricky one, my bot didn't want it for a while either
2010-09-22T08:02:09  <bartwe> it seems to have won the game for you
2010-09-22T08:02:24  <bartwe> i think it is due to my bot evaluating the fitness of fleets, not whole game states
2010-09-22T08:02:40  <sigh> that's what I do also
2010-09-22T08:02:59  <sigh> I don't look at the game state as a whole... I can't think of how to do it
2010-09-22T08:03:06  <bartwe> ha
2010-09-22T08:03:09  <sigh> I mean a good way of doing it
2010-09-22T08:03:29  <bartwe> i have some things that work so far
2010-09-22T08:03:59  <bartwe> i was thinking of building something that i could train/evaluate against known outcomes
2010-09-22T08:04:27  <sigh> yeah, possibly... but I don't want to invest the effort until I have a better understanding of what works
2010-09-22T08:05:02  <bartwe> so far for me, better prediction == better score
2010-09-22T08:05:15  <sigh> yeah, that makes sense
2010-09-22T08:05:28  <bartwe> so i'm down tuning the skewed score functions and improving prediction

2010-09-22T08:42:47  <boegel> the latest ones are doing pretty good though, and I haven't even fully implemented my strategy yet :)

2010-09-22T08:44:32  <drewrobb> i also think your bot is strong at spreading out quickly
2010-09-22T08:44:46  <drewrobb> more late game neutrals that it can capture at will

2010-09-22T08:50:18  <boegel> retybok: yeah, but the nearby planets are so expensive: )
2010-09-22T08:50:35  <boegel> I'll have to think about on how to fix that one :)
2010-09-22T08:50:57  <boegel> retybok: also, if I would've spread out early, I would've lost the home planet
2010-09-22T08:51:10  <boegel> retybok: which might cause trouble
2010-09-22T08:51:17  <boegel> hard map imho
2010-09-22T08:52:00  <bartwe> oh wow
2010-09-22T08:52:01  <antimatroid> i'ma get this right soon
2010-09-22T08:52:34  <bartwe> if you don't retaliate you could spare 20 units to take the 7 neutral
2010-09-22T08:52:50  <bartwe> infact i think you have a predictor bug in that you attack
2010-09-22T08:53:27  <bartwe> the distance gives you a 20 unit margin
2010-09-22T08:53:40  <boegel> bartwe: if I give up just one more ship, I lose the home planet, which means I'm doomed imho
2010-09-22T08:53:58  <bartwe> nah
2010-09-22T08:54:22  <bartwe> if you don't retaliate, the distance is means a time off set of 4 steps
2010-09-22T08:54:27  <boegel> bartwe: you don't think so?
2010-09-22T08:54:51  <bartwe> which at the growthrate means you have 20 units more then the enemy at time of arrival of his fleet
2010-09-22T08:54:57  <bartwe> then at the time he sent his fleet
2010-09-22T08:55:00  <boegel> bartwe: if I don't retaliate, the other guy has more budget...
2010-09-22T08:55:06  <bartwe> so ?
2010-09-22T08:55:15  <bartwe> you have a single, onetime budget of 20 units
2010-09-22T08:55:24  <boegel> bartwe: so he can kill my home planet if I spend my budget somewhere else
2010-09-22T08:55:34  <bartwe> untrue
2010-09-22T08:55:38  <boegel> hmm
2010-09-22T08:55:46  <bartwe> he cant take your homeworld if you send 20 units
2010-09-22T08:55:54  <bartwe> but only if you dont retaliate
2010-09-22T08:56:01  <drewrobb> yeah, just attacking the opponent start position is suboptimal
2010-09-22T08:56:09  <drewrobb> i think
2010-09-22T08:56:40  <hamstah> anyone has a better bot than the default to release? :)
2010-09-22T08:56:41  <boegel> drewrobb: well, how do you know it's his start position?
2010-09-22T08:56:41  <contestbot> Top 10 players: McLeopold(3534), kcm1700(3519), adumlah(3416), dmj111(3391), vinx33(3355), EBraun(3318), montanalow(3292), paulus(3272), wagstaff(3249), goldman(3241)
2010-09-22T08:56:46  <hamstah> need a better one to test against
2010-09-22T08:56:49  <bartwe> it is only suboptimal if he sends more then his initial budget minus home2home traveltime times growth
2010-09-22T08:56:57  <bartwe> atleast
2010-09-22T08:57:09  <drewrobb> boegel: huh?
2010-09-22T08:57:10  <bartwe> assuming his capture is not of equal or greater immediate value
2010-09-22T08:57:38  <boegel> drewrobb: well, ok, you could deduce that, but your bot doesn't know which turn it's playing, right?
2010-09-22T08:58:01  <hamstah> why not?
2010-09-22T08:58:26  <drewrobb> true, i'm just saying in the initial position of that game that it is suboptimal to all in attack the opponent
2010-09-22T08:58:32  <boegel> hamstah: because it's invoked for every turn seperately
2010-09-22T08:58:38  <hamstah> boegel ?
2010-09-22T08:58:42  <hamstah> it's a pipe
2010-09-22T08:59:01  <hamstah> the process waits for input
2010-09-22T08:59:09  <hamstah> but still the same process
2010-09-22T08:59:30  <boegel> hamstah: hmm, well, I never looked at the bare bones of the starter packages
2010-09-22T08:59:42  <boegel> hamstah: so, there's a way to pass info across turns?
2010-09-22T08:59:42  <hamstah> hehe
2010-09-22T08:59:47  <hamstah> of course.
2010-09-22T08:59:48  <hamstah> :)
2010-09-22T09:00:04  <hamstah> it's kept in memory
2010-09-22T09:00:11  <boegel> k
2010-09-22T09:00:17  <boegel> I should look into that probably
2010-09-22T09:00:18  <boegel> :D
2010-09-22T09:00:21  <bartwe> drewrobb: i think it is retty close to optimal for shortrange
2010-09-22T09:00:23  <hamstah> probably.
2010-09-22T09:00:35  <hamstah> pretty effective for short range yeah
2010-09-22T09:00:42  <hamstah> look at ragebot when it's close to you
2010-09-22T09:00:45  <bartwe> because it maximizes the impact of using the budget for a second planet
2010-09-22T09:00:53  <boegel> although, I haven't felt a need for it yet
2010-09-22T09:01:13  <bartwe> or capturing the opponents home in the first few steps which is pretty much a guaranteed win
2010-09-22T09:01:27  <drewrobb> i have a strategy that dominates, immediately capture the 7
2010-09-22T09:01:38  <bartwe> drewrobb: agreed on the 7
2010-09-22T09:02:11  <bartwe> but not expending the units on attacking the opponents home means that the 7 is less of a tiebreaker then it can be
2010-09-22T09:02:14  <drewrobb> so if both capture the 7, maybe it is optimal to stale mate again
2010-09-22T09:03:03  <bartwe> drewrobb: i think the game of two optimal bots is a stalemate, so i guess the right stalemate is optimal :)
2010-09-22T09:03:28  <boegel> I wouldn't exactly call my bot optimal right now :P
2010-09-22T09:03:39  <drewrobb> bartwe: not necessarily, the optimal might be a mixed equilibrium
2010-09-22T09:03:52  <bartwe> ut keeping the number of units down at the stalkemate means more influence of the remote planets
2010-09-22T09:04:29  <drewrobb> hmm that is interesting
2010-09-22T09:04:42  <drewrobb> so sparse territory favors low ship numbers
2010-09-22T09:05:38  <bartwe> i think it is more about deflating the joker of the stalemated forces
2010-09-22T09:05:57  <bartwe> increasing control at zero EV

2010-09-22T09:10:32  <drewrobb> i don't need almost 200 ships on that planet you are attacking
2010-09-22T09:11:33  <boegel> drewrobb: I don't see why you're attacking the hugely expensive smallish planet either...
2010-09-22T09:11:45  <drewrobb> you are blue
2010-09-22T09:12:06  <drewrobb> or did you mean another planet?
2010-09-22T09:12:10  <bartwe> drewrobb: why are you softening neutrals instead of outright taking them ?
2010-09-22T09:12:19  <boegel> drewrobb: ah, no, right, my mistake :)
2010-09-22T09:12:34  <drewrobb> i know that you can't get the neutrals
2010-09-22T09:12:35  <boegel> bartwe: to make it easier for you to win? :P
2010-09-22T09:12:55  <drewrobb> softening is only suboptimal if you can't finish the job
2010-09-22T09:12:56  <bartwe> drewrobb: still, why send lower forces ?
2010-09-22T09:13:17  <bartwe> sending a larger force later means longer flexibility, less predictability
2010-09-22T09:13:25  <drewrobb> meh, currently too hard to implement
2010-09-22T09:13:31  <bartwe> and if your prediction changes you have no investment
2010-09-22T09:13:48  <drewrobb> i should hold the closer planet until needed
2010-09-22T09:14:46  <drewrobb> that still could backfire if a higher priority task comes about
2010-09-22T09:15:10  <drewrobb> probably better overall though
2010-09-22T09:18:39  <bartwe> cool, tasks with priotity
2010-09-22T09:18:43  <bartwe> sounds good

2010-09-22T10:04:19  <Zaphus> yeah, I think I might - it's only trivially better than the last one, but since it takes several days to get a good number of games on the official server I figure I should upload now so I have enough by the weekend
2010-09-22T10:04:30  <Zaphus> wish the official server could give out games more regularly
2010-09-22T10:05:03  <Zaphus> saying that, I've had 4 games in the last 45 minutes (official server)
2010-09-22T10:05:28  <danielvf> Zaphus: Within the next week, we should have at least another server online playing games.
2010-09-22T10:06:10  <antimatroid> oh, i'm not uploading this to the main site, it's far too bad
2010-09-22T10:06:11  <Zaphus> danielvf: that will be awesome... I think the imbalance between those that get lucky and get lots of games, and those that dont, kind of sucks.  I've been on both ends.
2010-09-22T10:07:21  <Zaphus> antimatroid: ok, thats fair enough.  I wonder if I should leave mine alone to see where it settles on the main site, it's still not at the point where it's settled (but I think it's close, after 3 days)
2010-09-22T10:08:05  <danielvf> Zaphus: Yes, more games will rock.

2010-09-22T10:36:55  <bartwe> weird, gaining ranks on benzedrine due to bots getting removed from the ranking
2010-09-22T10:38:58  <boegel> bartwe: the official ranking?
2010-09-22T10:39:08  <boegel> bartwe: are they taking out "cheaters"?
2010-09-22T10:39:30  <jmcarthur> <antimatroid> jmcarthur: would it really have helped that much? after like 10 levels it was hard to really penetrate the game tree much further when it was big   <-- it would certainly have helped me, but i'm not doing game tree stuff

2010-09-22T10:53:22  <retybok> bartwe: I think bots that haven't played in 24 hours are removed
2010-09-22T10:54:20  <bartwe> retybok: i think that games that are older then 24 hours aren't taken into account for the elo calculation, so there is no evidence for a score, i think
2010-09-22T10:54:32  <bartwe> hmz, shouldn't that make the ranking unstable at the end...
2010-09-22T10:54:41  <bartwe> notsure, i should ask dhartmei about that
2010-09-22T10:55:20  <retybok> if you look at the "Last" column in the rankings, it's never over 24 hours
2010-09-22T10:55:35  <retybok> other than that, I don't know anything :)

2010-09-22T11:02:43  <hamstah> any idea how point are calculated?
2010-09-22T11:04:01  <hamstah> I lost 200 in the rankings by winning twice
2010-09-22T11:06:05  <boegel> hamstah: you shoudln't be winning then, should you?
2010-09-22T11:07:58  <hamstah> I had 1 game with my new bot, ranked 531, then for a while I had "ranking N/A", then 2 victories and now rank is 784.

2010-09-22T11:22:00  <jmcarthur> hamstah: the points are a bayesian estimate of your Elo (google it) score. your score can go down for reasons other than mere wins or losses. for example, if you win against an opponent your score will usually go up, but if past opponents drop in score your score will also drop because then yours wins aren't worth as much and your losses spell an even worse fate
2010-09-22T11:22:58  <hamstah> oh ok.
2010-09-22T11:23:08  <hamstah> but
2010-09-22T11:23:20  <jmcarthur> hamstah: that is, if you lose to a bot with an estimated score of 2000 then your score is probably (but not necessarily) under 2000, but then if that bot's score drops then your score is probably, but still not necessarily, lower than initially estimated
2010-09-22T11:23:20  <hamstah> nevermind.
2010-09-22T11:23:36  <hamstah> I see
2010-09-22T11:23:55  <boegel> complicated, but it makes sense
2010-09-22T11:24:03  <jmcarthur> oh i guess it's key to point out that your score is being recalculated even if you don't play games
2010-09-22T11:24:09  <hamstah> but since the bots are randomly chosen, isnt there a risk to drop points when playing with a player below you?
2010-09-22T11:24:15  <jmcarthur> nah
2010-09-22T11:24:20  <jmcarthur> first, they aren't entirely random
2010-09-22T11:24:38  <jmcarthur> second, your confidence interval tightens as you play more games, which makes your mean score less volatile
2010-09-22T11:25:01  <hamstah> ok
2010-09-22T11:25:03  <jmcarthur> third, you will only lose that many points if you are losing games to low ranking bots
2010-09-22T11:25:03  <Olathe> dhartmei_: Are you there?
2010-09-22T11:25:08  <hamstah> just have to wait for more games then
2010-09-22T11:25:11  <jmcarthur> in which case you deserve to lose those points anyway
2010-09-22T11:25:38  <jmcarthur> winning games against low ranking bots doesn't help you that much, though
2010-09-22T11:25:47  <hamstah> so in fact my first 531 was overestimated regarding the strength of the bots I won against
2010-09-22T11:25:52  <hamstah> yeah
2010-09-22T11:25:55  <jmcarthur> the scheduler tries to match bots with similar ranks, but also still adds in some variety
2010-09-22T11:26:01  <hamstah> good
2010-09-22T11:26:02  <jmcarthur> that is probably true
2010-09-22T11:26:32  <jmcarthur> i wish the rankings would show confidence intervals
2010-09-22T11:26:38  <jmcarthur> i think it would clear up a lot of questions about this
2010-09-22T11:26:42  <hamstah> yes
2010-09-22T11:27:07  <hamstah> would be good to have an history of ranking/points as well.

2010-09-22T11:32:47  <jmcarthur> would be nicer on the server and nicer for us
2010-09-22T11:32:50  <pgpaskar_> the visualizer fetches the game from a php page which u can pull

2010-09-22T14:17:11  <antimatroid1> and you just beat me :(
2010-09-22T14:17:17  <dhartmei_> hmm, this is really strange. pick a couple of revisions of your bot, run 1000 games among random pairs on random maps, then run bayeselo. i get wildy different ratings each time.
2010-09-22T14:18:10  <antimatroid1> my bot?
2010-09-22T14:18:14  <dhartmei_> either there's a bug in the scripts, or the random maps have a huge influence, or the revisions are too close.
2010-09-22T14:18:20  <antimatroid1> i did a lot of messing around tonight, and broke it lots of times
2010-09-22T14:18:58  <dhartmei_> i see it with my bot, basically i can't tell which revision is the best...
2010-09-22T14:19:27  <Zannick> run one game per bot pair + map
2010-09-22T14:19:28  <drewrobb> i spent 8 hours on my bot yesterday only to see a 10% win improvement
2010-09-22T14:19:41  <antimatroid1> my original 3.1415 was good, but then i ruined elo score for that testing before
2010-09-22T14:19:55  <antimatroid1> expect new 4.11 to be half decent, not sure if it'll be as good as 3.1415 proper
2010-09-22T14:20:06  <dhartmei_> i compared to a full tournament, play each bot once against each other on each of 100 random maps, then reverse positions. still random ratings.
2010-09-22T14:20:33  <dhartmei_> if a re-generate the 100 maps randomly, ratings change wildly
2010-09-22T14:22:05  <dhartmei_> try it, run your last two revisions against each other, on 1000 random maps. repeat that a couple of times, compare ratings. do you get consisten t results?
2010-09-22T14:23:31  <drewrobb> why is ELO better to use in this sort of benchmarking than W/L record?
2010-09-22T14:23:54  <drewrobb> oh, are you testing >2 bots?
2010-09-22T14:24:11  <dhartmei_> in the first case, yes. for 2, elo is the same as w/l record, i assume.
2010-09-22T14:25:06  <drewrobb> testing against your own bots seems like imbreeding
2010-09-22T14:26:17  <antimatroid1> bleh, bot seems to suck

2010-09-22T14:53:02  <dhartmei_> running the map generator from the repository
2010-09-22T14:53:09  <jmcarthur> i mean the results
2010-09-22T14:53:37  <jmcarthur> are they even ballpark-consistent?
2010-09-22T14:53:41  <dhartmei_> entries jumping +- 30% in ranks
2010-09-22T14:53:53  <dstufft> agaisnt yourself?
2010-09-22T14:53:54  <dhartmei_> top rank changing entirely
2010-09-22T14:54:10  <jmcarthur> how many versions of your bot in a tournament? just two?
2010-09-22T14:54:16  <dstufft> there's nothing random in your bots is there?
2010-09-22T14:54:23  <dhartmei_> i tried 2, 5, and 7
2010-09-22T14:54:29  <dhartmei_> no, no randomness in the bot
2010-09-22T14:54:41  <jmcarthur> okay, once you have as many as 7 then the results should certainly be stabilizing a bit
2010-09-22T14:55:15  <jmcarthur> i would say that 2 or 3 isn't enough to constrain the confidence intervals at all (except perhaps for the middle bot in the 3-player case)
2010-09-22T14:56:01  <jmcarthur> dhartmei_: by "in ranks" do you mean actual numbering ranks or do you mean elo scores?
2010-09-22T14:56:45  <contestbot> Top 10 players: kcm1700(3552), McLeopold(3543), adumlah(3447), dmj111(3439), EBraun(3385), wagstaff(3370), paulus(3348), vinx33(3334), drewrobb(3317), montanalow(3292)
2010-09-22T14:58:36  <dhartmei_> both, in one tournament, revision A would be rank 1 with 300+ elo, revision B rank 4 with 200+ elo. next tournament, they could be reversed, or revision C would be rank 1, etc.

2010-09-22T15:02:03  <jmcarthur> could shuffle the results from a single tournament and see if bayeselo gives the same output

2010-09-22T15:08:13  <jmcarthur> but they can take many forms
2010-09-22T15:09:02  <McLeopold> I'm going to attempt to make the growth potential from to points on the map the same, but not exact

2010-09-22T15:16:03  <dhartmei_> the server does almost nothing (just advances turns), it's all network io bound

2010-09-22T15:18:19  <FlagCapper> Are there any people with access to the main server here? Who might be able to tell me why my bot keeps losing in themiddle of games?
2010-09-22T15:18:23  <dhartmei_> ah, 40% user time is just bayeselo running every minute for 20+ seconds :) 98% idle without bayeselo
2010-09-22T15:19:07  <boiserm> on http://ai-contest.com/simple_strategy_guide.php in the "Anything to Get Ahead" section, there is no pw.Production() function
2010-09-22T15:19:18  <boiserm> in the java or python starter packages
2010-09-22T15:19:24  <boiserm> no biggie, but confusing
2010-09-22T15:19:55  <boiserm> Also, in the java starter package, the source for all of the example bots is the same as MyBot.java
2010-09-22T15:21:20  <boiserm> Is this a known issue?  Already fixed?  A mistake on my part?
2010-09-22T15:22:24  <jmcarthur> did you actually try a diff or md5sum of the examples against MyBot?
2010-09-22T15:22:40  <jmcarthur> i'm pretty sure most of them are not actually the same
2010-09-22T15:23:20  <boiserm> the executables are definitely different, but it's the sources that seem identical... let me double check the source files to make sure I'm not an idiot
2010-09-22T15:23:27  <FlagCapper> jmcarthur: do you have access to logs for the games on the official server?

2010-09-22T15:24:18  <jmcarthur> you may just be assuming because you saw my name somewhere
2010-09-22T15:24:27  <FlagCapper> Probably
2010-09-22T15:25:08  <FlagCapper> Yeah, maybe I was thinking of j3camero.
2010-09-22T15:25:11  <Zannick> FlagCapper: likely issues are timeouts, divide by zero, accessing the first element of an empty list
2010-09-22T15:25:19  <Zannick> i would look for those first
2010-09-22T15:25:25  <Naktibalda> boiserm: RandomBot is trully random
2010-09-22T15:25:29  <FlagCapper> I already took care of timeouts
2010-09-22T15:25:40  <Zannick> unfortunately there is no method currently for determining why you failed
2010-09-22T15:25:41  <FlagCapper> The biggest thing though is that the bot works just fine on the TCP server.
2010-09-22T15:26:02  <Zannick> there has been a patch waiting admin approval+rollout for a couple weeks now
2010-09-22T15:26:09  <FlagCapper> But it randomly loses every game on the official one.
2010-09-22T15:26:32  <FlagCapper> Ok, I'll try to contact one of the admins if I can.
2010-09-22T15:26:47  <dwchandler> big difference between official server and tcp server may be python version
2010-09-22T15:26:55  <FlagCapper> I use C++
2010-09-22T15:27:09  <dwchandler> right
2010-09-22T15:27:15  <boiserm> jmcarthur: looks like I'm only partially an idiot.  BullyBot and ExpandBot are identical
2010-09-22T15:27:19  <Zannick> if your machine is much more powerful than the server then it could still be timeout
2010-09-22T15:27:33  <dwchandler> FlagCapper: I got mixed up with some above stuff. sorry
2010-09-22T15:27:42  <FlagCapper> No problem
2010-09-22T15:27:53  <FlagCapper> My machine is pretty weak, and I check for timeouts anyway.
2010-09-22T15:28:16  <FlagCapper> And I've tested the timeout checker by using an infinite loop and my bot never goes over 1 second.

2010-09-22T15:30:21  <Zannick> not sure if it'll make a difference due to compiling
2010-09-22T15:30:23  <FlagCapper> 32 bit
2010-09-22T15:30:42  <FlagCapper> But yeah, I don't see why it would make a difference. It's something to consider though
2010-09-22T15:31:06  <FlagCapper> All my previous bots worked however, so unless they're using a new server...
2010-09-22T15:31:16  <FlagCapper> Or I added a new feature that's incompatible.
2010-09-22T15:31:30  <Zannick> well, yeah, i'd recommend looking over what you added
2010-09-22T15:32:55  <Naktibalda> negative fleet size, too big fleet, etc
2010-09-22T15:33:27  <FlagCapper> If that was an issue, it wouldn't work on the TCP server.
2010-09-22T15:33:36  <FlagCapper> And I check for those things.
2010-09-22T15:33:41  <Zannick> the tcp server kicks you now for invalid orders
2010-09-22T15:33:50  <Zannick> as does the main server
2010-09-22T15:34:02  <FlagCapper> Did it ignore them before?

2010-09-22T16:50:27  <dhartmei> parsing a couple of ints should be almost io bound...

2010-09-22T17:47:08  <Mathnerd314> they might introduce asymmetric maps later that your bot plays twice, one from each side

2010-09-22T18:28:42  <jmcarthur> no reason not to use it
2010-09-22T18:29:05  <dwchandler> 1) d/l git, 2) go to where your source is, 3) git init
2010-09-22T18:29:15  <jmcarthur> *ahem* s/git/darcs/
2010-09-22T18:29:21  <dwchandler> meh
2010-09-22T18:29:38  <dwchandler> git/darcs/mercurial are all fine
2010-09-22T18:29:51  <jmcarthur> git and mercurial beat svn at least
2010-09-22T18:30:01  <dwchandler> oh yes they do
2010-09-22T18:30:48  <jmcarthur> but whenever i use git i always find myself missing real cherry picking
2010-09-22T18:30:55  <dwchandler> can you get a virgin copy of ghc HEAD using darcs now?
2010-09-22T18:31:01  <jmcarthur> hell yeah
2010-09-22T18:31:03  <dwchandler> or is it still busted
2010-09-22T18:31:05  <jmcarthur> in like 2.5 minutes
2010-09-22T18:32:12  <jmcarthur> and then you can do it in like 2.5 seconds after that because it caches it locally
2010-09-22T18:33:46  <jmcarthur> the only thing from git i really miss is stash, and an equivalent to that is in the works
2010-09-22T18:34:15  <jmcarthur> well, and there's another feature i'd love to have that would be a more darcs-like alternative to in-place branching
2010-09-22T18:34:48  <jmcarthur> which is to be able to toggle patches on and off at will
2010-09-22T18:34:58  <jmcarthur> without an auxillery repo or patchfile
2010-09-22T18:35:28  <jmcarthur> although the stash alternative in the works can do a similar thing by explicitly specifying a patchfile at least

2010-09-22T19:19:19  <ratatata> it was like that for some time.. one game per 40m was the average I always had
2010-09-22T19:21:23  <boegel> urgh, I hate it when you fix a bug and suddenly your bot loses more than before :(
2010-09-22T19:21:38  <Zaphus> ratatata:  This time yesterday I was averaging about 180 minutes between games, I like the change.   dang, just played another one - lost to sighbot :-(

2010-09-22T19:24:29  <Zaphus> sigh:  I do have to fix the logic that lets you crush me every time, it's pretty obvious the mistakes it's making, I could at least put up a fight!
2010-09-22T19:25:06  <Zaphus> New server rule:   If (owner is in IRC chat) then playmoregames
2010-09-22T19:25:40  <sigh> heh
2010-09-22T19:25:50  <boegel> I love it how all bots lose a fair amount of games, keeps it interesting
2010-09-22T19:27:06  <boiserm> dwchandler: Yeah, I tested only against my previous bot, thought I had improved, but then uploaded it and ...not so much.
2010-09-22T19:27:50  <sigh> that's why I like to have a variety of strategies to test against locally
2010-09-22T19:29:14  <sigh> I run my latest creation in a large round robin before promoting to tcp (or main server)
2010-09-22T19:29:28  <Zaphus> sigh:  wouldnt want to throw me one of your old bot executables to test against locally would you ?  :-)
2010-09-22T19:29:39  <boiserm> :)

2010-09-22T19:30:27  <boiserm> sigh: I haven't invested enough time in this to have much variety in my strategies.
2010-09-22T19:30:32  <boiserm> most are incremental improvements
2010-09-22T19:30:42  <boiserm> my most recent version is the biggest change so far
2010-09-22T19:30:53  <boiserm> but it's too soon to know how it will do
2010-09-22T19:31:11  <sigh> boiserm: you'll find that sometimes small tweaks of parameters can change the strategy dramatically
2010-09-22T19:31:50  <sigh> my changes have mostly been incremental too, in terms of code
2010-09-22T19:31:58  <boiserm> sigh: true.  I need to work on parameterizing things more, probably.
2010-09-22T19:33:09  <sigh> for example changing your evaluation function should be one line of code, but results in wildly different strategies
2010-09-22T19:33:42  <sigh> even if it doesn't do as well as your main bot, it's still good for testing
2010-09-22T19:34:17  <dwchandler> indeed
2010-09-22T19:34:19  <boiserm> sigh: good point
2010-09-22T19:34:43  <boiserm> here's a question... after 200 turns, the winner is the one with the most ships on planets or in fleets?
2010-09-22T19:34:44  <dwchandler> I had a bad bot, but it was opportunistic about taking over the "home world"
2010-09-22T19:34:49  <boiserm> or just the most ships on planets?
2010-09-22T19:34:52  <sigh> dwchandler: ragebot? :P
2010-09-22T19:34:59  <dwchandler> made a couple of nice wins
2010-09-22T19:35:15  <dwchandler> sigh: no, one of my dwc-### bots
2010-09-22T19:35:19  <sigh> boiserm: ships anywhere, plants or fleets
2010-09-22T19:35:26  <boiserm> sigh: ok, thanks
2010-09-22T19:35:31  <dwchandler> I do not think I've ever lost to ragebot, btw

2010-09-22T19:35:42  <dwchandler> which is odd, because my bots are not good
2010-09-22T19:36:41  <sigh> I still lose to ragebot on a few maps... fixing that should be my next job, because I can see that weakness affecting my tournament results

2010-09-22T20:19:23  <danielvf> It's probably a bug in the server - random time-outs happen too often.

2010-09-22T20:52:41  <FlagCapper> I'm curious as to why
2010-09-22T20:54:17  <danielvf> timeout - could be a server problem. We are will be working on that next - after getting up a new server.
2010-09-22T20:55:08  <FlagCapper> OK, because I have something in my code to prevent timeouts. It's based on clock speed though, so maybe if you compiled it on a different server than you ran it there could be a problem?

2010-09-22T21:15:23  <amstan> i think it's 32
2010-09-22T21:15:46  <amstan> though any code/software packages should be able to run on 64 bit, since other servers might be diff
2010-09-22T21:16:26  <danielvf> It's looking like both amazon and rackspace are using AMD processors.
2010-09-22T21:16:42  <danielvf> That would mean we would have to recompile all bots. :(

2010-09-22T21:20:05  <jmpespxoreax> my assumption is either cloud or user contributed servers
2010-09-22T21:20:08  <jmpespxoreax> sorry for the mix up
2010-09-22T21:20:29  <danielvf> either cloud or rented dedicated server
2010-09-22T21:21:08  <jmcarthur> the latter may be easier to set up a VM-based sandbox on
