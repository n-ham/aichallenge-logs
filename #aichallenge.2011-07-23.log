2011-07-23T06:53:59  <antimatroid> yes
2011-07-23T06:54:17  <antimatroid> a guy blew up a car bomb outside the pm
2011-07-23T06:54:36  <antimatroid> s office, then went to an island hosting a youth political camp and killed over 80 young people
2011-07-23T06:54:52  <antimatroid> he went over dressed up like a policemen, rounded people up then opened fire on the

2011-07-23T06:55:17  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-07-23T06:55:41  <antimatroid> well, at the moment it looks like it was all him
2011-07-23T06:55:57  <antimatroid> but it's a pretty well executed job if he did that in a team let alone himself, so time will hopefully tell
2011-07-23T06:56:00  <antimatroid> horrible thing though :(
2011-07-23T06:56:34  <_flag> The same man -- a blonde-blue eyed Norwegian with reported Christian fundamentalist, anti-Muslim views -- is suspected in both attacks. Source: http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/World/20110723/oslo-utoya-norway-bombing-camp-shooting-aftermath-110723/
2011-07-23T06:56:44  <_flag> :(
2011-07-23T06:57:34  <antimatroid> a lot of the media was quick to blame middle eastern organisations, but it looks like it was a nationalist christian who was critical of their countries immigration laws (particularly in the way of muslims), but this that isn't all official yet I don't think
2011-07-23T06:58:54  <antimatroid> there is one quite bad image floating around where you can see lots of clothes of people who tried to swim from the island, one deceased person and another person pleading to the gunman who is also in the shot :(
2011-07-23T07:00:03  <antimatroid> mcstar: when i climbed back into bed earlier, they were saying like estimated 20 maybe but not confirmed, it was a big :( moment when i got up again and they'd confirmed over 80 deaths
2011-07-23T07:11:07  <mcstar> index.hu says 84 on the island and 7 in the political district
2011-07-23T07:12:21  <mcstar> oh, and it says they found explosive materials on the island too?
2011-07-23T07:12:26  <mcstar> glad that didnt go off
2011-07-23T07:13:24  <mcstar> i just hope i will never experience something like this first-handed
2011-07-23T07:15:00  <mcstar> i think, that that man was really stupid: you can destroy/corrupt many systems that will call the people's/government's attention to your cause, taking lifes is really unnecessary
2011-07-23T07:15:18  <antimatroid> yeah, it's pretty awful
2011-07-23T07:15:29  <antimatroid> total horror movie like scene for the people on the island
2011-07-23T07:16:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: next time be a little more explicit, dont just write: ":( norway"
2011-07-23T07:17:20  <antimatroid> mcstar: never
2011-07-23T07:17:38  <mcstar> ok, i hope there wont be a next time, im just saying....
2011-07-23T07:20:13  <mcstar> my first search on google lead to the "fact": the assassin was a freemason
2011-07-23T07:20:33  <antimatroid> i hope it doesn't go up too much higher, there were 600-700 or so people on that small island
2011-07-23T07:21:12  <antimatroid> the guy "registered" a business or whatever to do some kind of farming in 2009! but they don't think he ever did any farming, more used it to obtain materials for the bomb
2011-07-23T07:21:48  <antimatroid> so one would assume they've been planning at least something like this since 2009 at the latest
2011-07-23T07:22:14  <mcstar> i guess the norwegian secret service soon will get a slap in their faces
2011-07-23T07:22:49  <antimatroid> i saw a comment a while ago about a possible video on the internet saying there would be an attack which was changed to a  movie of a dog or something yesterday
2011-07-23T07:22:55  <antimatroid> but i haven't seen anything said about that in a while
2011-07-23T07:23:15  <antimatroid> the guy made a twitter account with a single post, and there was a facebook page for the guy but no one seems sure of whether that is fake or not
2011-07-23T07:23:25  <antimatroid> either way it's been taken down, but google cache got it
2011-07-23T07:24:02  <antimatroid> there's also a pastebin somewhere of his posts on some website about political stuff
2011-07-23T07:24:47  <mcstar> omg i just saw the pic of the explosion, seems pretty serious, how come only 7 ppl are dead?
2011-07-23T07:25:13  <antimatroid> apparently most people are on holiday from work and it was raining at the time the bomb went off
2011-07-23T07:25:18  <antimatroid> so there wasn't too many people out on the street
2011-07-23T07:25:25  <antimatroid> otherwise there could have been hundreds dead
2011-07-23T07:25:50  <antimatroid> at first people thought that was on purpose? to minimise lost lives, but that seems to go against the guys second attack on the island
2011-07-23T07:26:18  <antimatroid> there's also the idea that the bomb was merely a way to tie up police resources and give him an excuse to get on the island armed and round people up like the did
2011-07-23T07:26:29  <antimatroid> but it's all pretty much speculation at this point i think
2011-07-23T07:27:06  <mcstar> so he isnt in custody/dead?
2011-07-23T07:27:13  <antimatroid> he's in custody and alive
2011-07-23T07:27:15  <antimatroid> thank god
2011-07-23T07:27:31  <antimatroid> i can only imagine what would happen if he couldn't even be interrogated
2011-07-23T07:27:47  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-07-23T07:27:59  <antimatroid> well, at least they can try and work out his motives now from him
2011-07-23T07:28:05  <mcstar> you suspect other bombs?
2011-07-23T07:28:16  <antimatroid> no, i'm curious of what they can get from him as to why
2011-07-23T07:28:29  <antimatroid> it's obviously politically motivated, but more answers would be nice
2011-07-23T07:28:53  <antimatroid> norway has a maximum jail sentence of 21 years apparently :\ but they can hold people indefinitely if they think the person poses a risk to general citizens, i doubt he'll get out of jail
2011-07-23T07:28:59  <mcstar> lol, i dont care, you cant "explain" something like this, obviously he is nuts, thats all
2011-07-23T07:29:35  <antimatroid> sure, you don't do that without serious problems, but it can still be nice to know peoples motivation, even if it has no grounding in logic whatsoever
2011-07-23T07:30:26  <antimatroid> i think it's too nice to attribute something like this to mental illness without actually checking
2011-07-23T07:30:29  <antimatroid> some people really just suck
2011-07-23T07:31:00  <antimatroid> it's almost like letting them off the hook for their horrendous actions and blaming an illness for it
2011-07-23T07:31:13  <antimatroid> (i'm not denying that can't be the case though)
2011-07-23T07:31:28  <mcstar> im quite sure it seemed to him, like a perfectly logic thing to do, the problem is that his logic was pretty twisted
2011-07-23T07:33:44  <mcstar> what really hits me, is that this can happen in a state, such as norway, which is quite developed, and people are usually educated there, and still, society breeds such outcasts in such a state too
2011-07-23T07:35:11  <antimatroid> i dunno, there's plenty of "bad" people in australia
2011-07-23T07:35:26  <antimatroid> although most of them i think of as stupid bogan scum probably without the mental capacity to pull something like this off
2011-07-23T07:35:52  <antimatroid> the tv here is saying a second person might have been arrested, but they can't confirm it
2011-07-23T07:45:01  <antimatroid> having the news on sucks :(

2011-07-23T08:52:12  <mleise> oh you were talking about that. I didn't scroll back.
2011-07-23T08:52:19  <antimatroid> pretty horrible
2011-07-23T08:52:39  <antimatroid> there hasn't really been any new information in hours and hours either
2011-07-23T08:52:44  <mleise> in deed. i almost couldn't believe what I saw
2011-07-23T08:53:05  <antimatroid> i saw it before climbing back into bed last night and was like crap, and they were saying like maybe 20 dead on the island
2011-07-23T08:53:15  <antimatroid> then i got up and saw 80 confirmed and my jaw droppedf
2011-07-23T08:54:24  <mleise> and this was a holiday island if I'm not mistaken.
2011-07-23T08:54:41  <antimatroid> it was a tiny island with a youth political camp of like 600-700 people
2011-07-23T08:54:50  <antimatroid> like a few hundred metres wide max
2011-07-23T08:55:16  <antimatroid> 600m off norways mainland, some people swam, some found it too cold and went back, others may have been hit while swimming and drowned
2011-07-23T08:55:48  <antimatroid> the guy went over there dressed as a policeman, rounded people up saying he was there for security or something to do with the bombing, then just opened fire on them :( it sounds horrific
2011-07-23T08:56:50  <mleise> :(
2011-07-23T08:57:29  <antimatroid> we had a massacre in tasmania over 10 years ago, but nowhere near that bad and without the bomb
2011-07-23T08:58:32  <antimatroid> it's crazy to think how much that will impact the political course of norway with so many young aspiring politicians dead :\ yet one will never know what the alternate landscape would have been
2011-07-23T08:58:39  <antimatroid> and no doubt this event will shape their future as well
2011-07-23T09:00:08  <mleise> Until now I didn't even know that Norway had such a problem with right-wing extremists
2011-07-23T09:00:44  <mleise> This action will not help their popularity though.
2011-07-23T09:02:30  <antimatroid> i don't think they'd have more of a problem than any other nation? one extreme example doesn't really give much
2011-07-23T09:02:52  <antimatroid> apparently he is quite opposed to norway's immigration laws, particularly with muslims
2011-07-23T09:03:21  <antimatroid> yet a lot of media organisations were quite quick to blame middle eastern organisations along with a lot of their (right-wing) followers
2011-07-23T09:05:16  <mleise> me too. i heard 'bomb' and I was like 'al quaida'?
2011-07-23T09:06:52  <antimatroid> i didn't until i saw comments about norway having troops in libya and afghanistan, it just didn't seem to make sense for them to hit norway without that knowledge :\
2011-07-23T09:07:21  <antimatroid> i can sort of understand them hitting countries like the us and uk, but I don't agree with it or their tactics (targeting civillians)
2011-07-23T09:07:40  <antimatroid> but i also condem a lot of the actions taken by countries like the u*'s and even my own :\

2011-07-23T09:24:02  <mcstar> but if a european does the same, he makes such a horrible thing because he is literally crazy, or bore
2011-07-23T09:24:05  <mcstar> bored
2011-07-23T09:24:16  <mcstar> that is totally wrong
2011-07-23T09:25:02  <mcstar> i condemn him more, than al-quaeda(not sure of the spelling)
2011-07-23T09:25:16  <mcstar> more, than basks
2011-07-23T09:27:46  <mcstar> or ira, the same
2011-07-23T09:27:47  <mleise> Hey, me too. I was talking about the change that happened in Afghanistan. First I believe a lot of people were happy to get some freedoms back. Now the foreign troops are more or less another occupation.
2011-07-23T09:28:27  <mcstar> sure, this happened before, i guess
2011-07-23T09:28:36  <mcstar> and with korea, the same thing
2011-07-23T09:29:15  <mcstar> i mean im not educated in these matters, but the us stepped in quite a few neibouring conflicts
2011-07-23T09:29:43  <mcstar> but this attack on norway, is totally different
2011-07-23T09:30:23  *** eashoka <eashoka!70876563@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.135.101.99> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-23T09:30:24  <mcstar> the guy killed his fellow men and women because he doesnt like other nation's people?
2011-07-23T09:30:49  <mleise> I wasn't comparing that. Although I guess Bin-Laden *was* some kind of crazy guy.
2011-07-23T09:31:23  <mcstar> maybe
2011-07-23T09:31:27  <mcstar> i try not to judge
2011-07-23T09:31:40  <mcstar> i dont really know the circumstances, why he did what he did
2011-07-23T09:34:34  <mcstar> id rather call gaddafi crazy though
2011-07-23T09:34:41  <mleise> I guess because of christian nations having troops in several islamic countries at that time.
2011-07-23T09:36:54  <mleise> mcstar: I totally agree http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8564999/Gaddafi-ordered-mass-rape-as-a-weapon-International-Criminal-Court-claims.html

2011-07-23T09:44:06  <mleise> fresh and juicy, about what?
2011-07-23T09:44:10  <mcstar> well, they dont sing together anymore
2011-07-23T09:44:52  <mcstar> (Fresh was a hung. girl band)
2011-07-23T09:45:14  <antimatroid> i want more information about the interrogations of the norway guy
2011-07-23T09:46:39  <mleise> they are kept secret until the investigations are closed -.-
2011-07-23T09:47:45  <mcstar> anyway, this incident shouldnt interfere with our lifes
2011-07-23T09:48:12  <mcstar> you can call me (whatever) but im already over it

2011-07-23T09:53:45  <antimatroid> eashoka: knew most of that, but seems to have a lot of info in one place, thanks :)
2011-07-23T09:55:32  <eashoka> I doubt whether there is any connection with his 'fundementalist christian' or 'anti muslim' views with the killings. rights wing extremist part seems more like it, but above all the guy has to be a crazy person to do such a thing. Now an interesting qsns is can you politically or religously categorixe an insane person ?peop
2011-07-23T09:56:34  <antimatroid> i can't deny my interest in the reactions of different groups when it's a christian and not a muslim commiting such acts
2011-07-23T09:57:12  <eashoka> Insane person is insane so his own whatever political/religous views amounts to very little isn't it ? :-)
2011-07-23T09:57:51  <antimatroid> that is my general opinion, but many others make statements blaming political/religious affiliations in such situations
2011-07-23T09:58:03  <antimatroid> i'm curious as to how much they will differ for general groups
2011-07-23T09:58:36  <mleise> And also you may ask the question what made him become that radical. It could be for example his family in general or some organization that the police should look into.
2011-07-23T09:59:07  <antimatroid> hard to say until the police talk about what they get from him
2011-07-23T09:59:18  <antimatroid> i can't imagine we'll know nothing more until after a trial
2011-07-23T10:00:26  <eashoka> antimatroid : yeah I think lot of people share ur interest. it is good to note that nut case hardliners of any side (equally) can and capable of doing horrific things.
2011-07-23T10:01:15  <antimatroid> http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ixag3/portrait_of_a_terrorist_anders_breivik_the_man/c27ewp3?context=3 that's my proof that i do agree with you :P
2011-07-23T10:01:35  <eashoka> oh you are a redditor!
2011-07-23T10:01:39  <eashoka> glad to know :-)
2011-07-23T10:01:50  <mleise> oh no he played computer games
2011-07-23T10:01:58  <antimatroid> i would guess that most people on here are redditors to some degree
2011-07-23T10:02:17  <eashoka> cool
2011-07-23T10:02:38  <mleise> if you ever see a hunting, computer game playing, conservative christian you know what it means

2011-07-23T17:24:52  <antimatroid> i didn't bother biting
2011-07-23T17:26:11  <mleise> These people are all off topic
2011-07-23T17:27:17  <antimatroid> how?
2011-07-23T17:27:19  <mleise> You talk about analyzing dreams and they all think astrology, wtf?
2011-07-23T17:27:47  <antimatroid> i made the topic switch by saying a comment sounded like someone talking about astrology
2011-07-23T17:27:47  <mleise> ah sorry I don't understand reddit
2011-07-23T17:27:59  <mleise> you linked to your comment
2011-07-23T17:46:49  <mleise> antimatroid: there are people talking about sleep paralysis. that's interesting. tomorrow morning I'll see how paralized I am when I wake up and how long it takes my brain to switch.
2011-07-23T17:47:08  <antimatroid> i've never had it
2011-07-23T17:47:41  <mleise> me neither, but we are all paralized while we are sleeping. we cannot run while sleeping for example
2011-07-23T17:48:36  <antimatroid> this norweigen guy is insane
2011-07-23T17:48:54  <mleise> I've seen a video of a dog (lying on his back) though that started to run while sleeping. when it finally woke it ran into the kitchen wall
2011-07-23T17:49:12  <antimatroid> there is now some manifesto out with like 900 pages of his political ramblings then at the end he has stuff on how to make bombs and carry out attacks etc.
2011-07-23T17:49:42  <mleise> antimatroid: a megalomaniac?
2011-07-23T17:50:45  <antimatroid> dunno, possibly?
2011-07-23T17:52:35  <mleise> what did he expect to happen after his attack anyway?
2011-07-23T17:55:30  <mleise> oh amy winehouse is dead

2011-07-23T20:45:35  <mleise> I think I can give up on rendering speed when the visualizer is zoomed in and improve the rendering when zoomed out by factor 5.

2011-07-23T20:48:39  <mleise> I'm currently testing with a 900 ants game. When this is done, the interaction on static maps with loads of ants (antpaste -> fastest access map) will also be fluid.
