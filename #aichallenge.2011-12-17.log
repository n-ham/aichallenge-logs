2011-12-17T02:38:01  <bhasker> as they are being played from my perspective
2011-12-17T02:38:07  <BenJackson> oh, no
2011-12-17T02:38:13  <BenJackson> I think thestinger added some better output
2011-12-17T02:38:17  <bhasker> my bot isn't getting any better
2011-12-17T02:38:18  <BenJackson> stats from his bot
2011-12-17T02:38:26  <BenJackson> I guess the C++ one logs the map by default
2011-12-17T02:38:33  <bhasker> yea that i have
2011-12-17T02:38:48  <bhasker> i guess i could write something on top
2011-12-17T02:38:51  <bhasker> of my logs
2011-12-17T02:38:53  <bhasker> to grab the state
2011-12-17T02:38:55  <bhasker> and visualize it
2011-12-17T02:39:22  <bhasker> i implemented minmax for battle but my eval function just blows
2011-12-17T02:39:33  <bhasker> thinking of just implementing the CombatAnt battle strategy
2011-12-17T02:39:50  <bhasker> no matter how i tweak my eval it just keeps doing stupid things
2011-12-17T02:40:16  <bhasker> and also the fact that i have to limit my move generation severly for it to run in a reasonable time
2011-12-17T02:41:34  <BenJackson> I never did see how to apply minmax to this
2011-12-17T02:41:36  <antimatroid> bhasker: how are you doing minimax/
2011-12-17T02:41:42  <antimatroid> my way is quite simple and works reasonably well
2011-12-17T02:42:03  <bhasker> i am creating islands
2011-12-17T02:42:08  <bhasker> and doing minimax on the island
2011-12-17T02:42:14  <bhasker> which results in some idiotic things sometimes
2011-12-17T02:42:16  <antimatroid> full minimax?
2011-12-17T02:42:22  <bhasker> no just a 2 ply
2011-12-17T02:42:28  <antimatroid> what moves?
2011-12-17T02:42:28  <bhasker> one move per side
2011-12-17T02:42:41  <bhasker> usually i make the move i want to make for my ant
2011-12-17T02:42:50  <bhasker> and for enemy i pick a few random moves + 1 move towards my ant
2011-12-17T02:43:03  <bhasker> and i add a stay at same place move as well
2011-12-17T02:43:14  <bhasker> like a dummy move for every ant
2011-12-17T02:43:33  <bhasker> then i make all my moves, make all enemy moves then evaluate
2011-12-17T02:44:00  <bhasker> and any ant involved in the minmax in my favour is not moved after that
2011-12-17T02:44:28  <bhasker> the problem usually results in the fact that my path finding in the island uses a wrapped world like the main state which causes issues
2011-12-17T02:44:37  <bhasker> because it makes wrong assumptions about which ants are closeby
2011-12-17T02:44:43  <bhasker> and within battle range
2011-12-17T02:45:04  <bhasker> something on the top end of island will think the one at bottom is in battle range which in reality will never happen
2011-12-17T02:45:41  <antimatroid> i just pass my battle functions locations/moves
2011-12-17T02:45:58  <antimatroid> it can look at stuff in state if it wants, but everything it does to simulate battle etc. it does with sets
2011-12-17T02:46:26  <antimatroid> for my ants, a "move" is a move for each ant
2011-12-17T02:46:57  <bhasker> yes same here
2011-12-17T02:47:03  <bhasker> hmm

2011-12-17T02:51:54  <bhasker> oh
2011-12-17T02:52:15  <bhasker> why is it faster on tcpants?
2011-12-17T02:52:18  <bhasker> better server?
2011-12-17T02:52:36  <BenJackson> we suspect some fluxid players don't respect the move time limit
2011-12-17T02:52:53  <bhasker> btw what exactly is the limit
2011-12-17T02:52:58  <bhasker> my bot goes over it for sure
2011-12-17T02:53:04  <bhasker> 500ms or 1second?
2011-12-17T02:53:20  <BenJackson> 500ms
2011-12-17T02:53:31  <BenJackson> but the tcp server actually waits 5s to avoid network timeouts
2011-12-17T02:53:34  <bhasker> heh my bot will probably timeout every game
2011-12-17T02:55:54  <antimatroid> my bot usually takes under 100ms i think

2011-12-17T03:08:43  <BenJackson> and I panicked because I thought that was fixed

2011-12-17T03:13:25  <bhasker> yea its mostly because ants don't remember where they were headed
2011-12-17T03:13:38  <bhasker> so every turn they can get new priorities
2011-12-17T03:13:45  <bhasker> so sometimes they end up wobbling
2011-12-17T03:13:46  <bhasker> :-\
2011-12-17T03:13:56  <bhasker> i need to add some logic around remembering where an ant was headed
2011-12-17T03:14:01  <bhasker> and only switch for higher priorites
2011-12-17T03:14:05  <BenJackson> I like to think of some goals as "stable" in the sorting sense
2011-12-17T03:14:13  <BenJackson> so if you move toward them you only become more attracted to them
2011-12-17T03:14:44  <bhasker> well sometimes the wobbling is also because my ants if you notice are still sometimes heading towards the same food
2011-12-17T03:14:51  <bhasker> thats a bug in my food collection
2011-12-17T03:14:55  <bhasker> more than one ant goes for same food
2011-12-17T03:14:59  <BenJackson> and if you pick bots individually for tasks you need to make sure your selection and movement of an ant makes him better suited to be re-selected next time
2011-12-17T03:15:00  <bhasker> so that causes some useless wobbling too
2011-12-17T03:15:15  <BenJackson> yeah individually scheduling food is important
2011-12-17T03:15:22  <BenJackson> in fact individually scheduling everything is probably important
2011-12-17T03:15:28  <BenJackson> but I resisted that for too long to change it all now
2011-12-17T03:16:32  <bhasker> heh mine is harder to fix given the way i am doing it
2011-12-17T03:16:42  <bhasker> i do a multisource BFS and move the ants to closest move next to them
2011-12-17T03:16:51  <bhasker> closest target
2011-12-17T03:16:59  <bhasker> so if two ants have the same food as closest target
2011-12-17T03:17:01  <bhasker> they will move to it
2011-12-17T03:17:20  <bhasker> not sure how to fix that :-\
2011-12-17T03:17:53  <BenJackson> yeah my original code was all about multi-source bfs
2011-12-17T03:17:55  <bhasker> since the ant has no idea what goal its moving towards
2011-12-17T03:18:13  <BenJackson> but despite the fact that you will get obvious unwanted clumping from that I resisted changing for a long time
2011-12-17T03:18:35  <BenJackson> if I was starting over I'd simplify my combat and spend all my time thinking about how to maneuver ants
2011-12-17T03:18:41  <bhasker> heh
2011-12-17T03:19:51  <antimatroid> BenJackson: great forum post
2011-12-17T03:20:12  <antimatroid> if only academic people cared about such things :(

2011-12-17T03:21:44  <itzkow> I'm getting really excited while my bot is playing, anyone else gets that?
2011-12-17T03:22:49  <BenJackson> itzkow: I get nervous for mine
2011-12-17T03:23:05  <antimatroid> i try not to watch
2011-12-17T03:23:14  <antimatroid> then hope it's a screen of "o"s when i look
2011-12-17T03:23:25  <BenJackson> bhasker: you have a problem I share to some extent:  you are reliant on outside influences (like food and movement of other ants) to jostle you into action sometimse

2011-12-17T03:26:34  <antimatroid> there were some pretty good comebacks in planet wars
2011-12-17T03:26:35  <BenJackson> oh yeah

2011-12-17T03:31:17  <BenJackson> but that must be a bug I should fix
2011-12-17T03:31:44  <antimatroid> i might need a "finish them" function
2011-12-17T03:34:42  <itzkow> frag stealing is funny

2011-12-17T03:49:13  <BenJackson> wow that map is a perfect example of how testing against yourself doesn't work

2011-12-17T03:57:53  <antimatroid> interesting
2011-12-17T03:58:28  <antimatroid> say you have a game with scores at 5,1,1 and a player with score 1 times out, the other player is allowed to continue on to decreasing their ranking
2011-12-17T03:58:31  <antimatroid> because they could increase it

2011-12-17T04:47:35  <Garf> the difference between the two is that one tries to see as much terrain as possible, while the other tries to explore as fast as possible

2011-12-17T06:34:09  <mcstar> sounds familiar
2011-12-17T06:34:26  <ikaros> yea hehe
2011-12-17T06:34:29  <jab_bott> well.. I say pretty well, actually it's a bit thick, but does the job in about 50% of cases - trouble is I know the good bots will avoid those and kill me on the other 50%

2011-12-17T06:38:45  <antimatroid> mcstar: :)
2011-12-17T06:38:48  <antimatroid> best game ever
2011-12-17T06:38:53  <antimatroid> nobody ever knows of it
2011-12-17T06:39:06  <mcstar> it just has a difficult to remember name
2011-12-17T06:39:17  <mcstar> antimatroid: how are you doing time-wise?
2011-12-17T06:39:22  <antimatroid> sure, but once you hear it you should know of the awesomenes
2011-12-17T06:39:26  <antimatroid> mcstar: laughing
2011-12-17T06:39:33  <antimatroid> usually under 100ms
2011-12-17T06:39:38  <mcstar> thats nice
2011-12-17T06:39:46  <antimatroid> my battle is oh so cheap
2011-12-17T06:40:06  <mcstar> mine too, i have a bfs that takes most of the time, ill take a look at it
2011-12-17T06:40:19  <mcstar> i dont know why is that so slow
2011-12-17T06:40:38  <mcstar> in every 5 turns, i go from 50ms to 250 say
2011-12-17T06:41:12  <antimatroid> i have a max search path for all bfs's except my last one
2011-12-17T06:41:12  <mcstar> its a multisource bfs, with a zillion sources though
2011-12-17T06:41:24  <antimatroid> at which point i bfs from any remaining targets and move ants as i find them
2011-12-17T06:41:52  <antimatroid> i update closest hill info etc. only when i need to from vision info or change of hill info
2011-12-17T06:42:03  <antimatroid> and only generate that up to vision depth etc.
2011-12-17T06:42:12  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you still have the battle code that you first wrote? or does it work on a dissimilar principle?
2011-12-17T06:42:15  <antimatroid> and i store a lot of stuff about battle locations for each location
2011-12-17T06:42:19  <antimatroid> mostly set up in turn 0
2011-12-17T06:42:33  <antimatroid> depends on which battle code you think was my first
2011-12-17T06:42:47  <antimatroid> my first attempt was a full minimax, but that was obviously never going to work
2011-12-17T06:42:56  <mcstar> you had an enumeration with agressive pruning
2011-12-17T06:43:08  <mcstar> thats what i remember
2011-12-17T06:43:09  <antimatroid> i never did any pruning with it, i gave up and did something else
2011-12-17T06:43:19  <mcstar> ok, thats what i was asking
2011-12-17T06:43:46  <antimatroid> a battle partition has a set of my ants and a set of enemy ants, for my ants I pick out like a set of offensive moves, defensive, etc., similarly for the enemy, then i run minimax on that
2011-12-17T06:44:02  <antimatroid> so there's like 4-5 moves total for my set of ants and about 4 moves for the enemies
2011-12-17T06:44:12  <mcstar> jab_bott: can you link an example?
2011-12-17T06:44:25  <mcstar> i do partitions too
2011-12-17T06:44:33  <mcstar> i have a cluster search algorithm
2011-12-17T06:44:52  <mcstar> but i dont enumerate at all any more
2011-12-17T06:45:33  <antimatroid> mine just depends on me being able to heuristically pick out decent sample moves
2011-12-17T06:45:55  <jab_bott> my entire bot is based on multi-source BFS - it's not really that good tbh, a little bit too brute-force, but som eclever tweaks in there
2011-12-17T06:47:08  <mcstar> lol, guy pasted a replay with the bot name: MyBotHuman
2011-12-17T06:47:08  <jab_bott> it runs super-fast though since I re-wrote it in C - I should probably time it
2011-12-17T06:47:21  <mcstar> MyBotHuman.php to be precise
2011-12-17T06:47:43  <mcstar> jab_bott: pls give a link to an interesting paste
2011-12-17T06:47:47  <mcstar> there are too many
2011-12-17T06:48:03  <jab_bott> mcstar: looks like all the good ones have gone off the bottom - It must clip old ones
2011-12-17T06:48:46  <jab_bott> I'll see if I can make one with my bot now, you'll see some of the inner workings of my bot
2011-12-17T06:48:49  <mcstar> my debug vis looks interesting, it has nice hue-maps, lines and stars
2011-12-17T06:49:10  <mcstar> jab_bott: thats probably not a good idea
2011-12-17T06:49:12  <jab_bott> post a paste or some images :)
2011-12-17T06:49:31  <mcstar> im against too much sharing
2011-12-17T06:49:47  <mcstar> it is still not late to incorporate things
2011-12-17T06:49:53  <jab_bott> mcstar: it's fine - I really don't mind, I'm not in this to be aggressively competitive - I'd rather learn and help others learn... I'm pretty sure I've got more to learn than I have to give, heh!
2011-12-17T06:50:39  <mcstar> well, had my new alg. worked out better, i would expect to cut my ranking in half

2011-12-17T06:53:20  <mcstar> i mean that particular alg. has potential, im just too stupid to make the best of it in this time limit
2011-12-17T06:56:02  <ikaros> i think i wont change anything further.. too few time and it sorta works so far
2011-12-17T06:56:13  <mcstar> few->little
2011-12-17T06:56:16  <ikaros> ill just relax and watch
2011-12-17T06:56:17  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-17T06:56:29  <antimatroid> lies
2011-12-17T06:56:38  <antimatroid> gotta do something stupid at the last minute and submit :)
2011-12-17T06:56:40  <ikaros> hehe

2011-12-17T06:56:52  <ikaros> well on the first submission the chances are high :))
2011-12-17T06:56:58  <jab_bott> hrm... the replay file for this game I just played is 118M - perhaps not so good for uploading
2011-12-17T06:57:11  <antimatroid> yes, but it'll be funnny if i pull it off :p
2011-12-17T06:57:11  <mcstar> i couldnt break the 80 skill barrier (yet)
2011-12-17T06:57:22  <antimatroid> mcstar: could? :P
2011-12-17T06:57:44  <mcstar> obviously not, maybe this new submission will
2011-12-17T06:57:56  <mcstar> it was marginally worse
2011-12-17T06:57:59  <mcstar> like 79.5
2011-12-17T06:58:38  <mcstar> ikaros: what was wrong with lue?
2011-12-17T06:58:40  <mcstar> lua
2011-12-17T06:58:56  <ikaros> nothing.. i like to experiment :)
2011-12-17T06:59:02  <ikaros> i should have stayed with lua :P
2011-12-17T06:59:12  <ikaros> would have saved time and such :)
2011-12-17T06:59:13  <mcstar> was it slow or somethign?
2011-12-17T06:59:21  <ikaros> no its really fast with luajit
2011-12-17T06:59:28  <ikaros> i had a prototype
2011-12-17T06:59:43  <mcstar> 74 skill isnt particularly bad :D
2011-12-17T06:59:48  <ikaros> and wanted to rewrite everything when i knew what to do with the bot
2011-12-17T07:00:03  <ikaros> it had no real combat back then
2011-12-17T07:00:44  <ikaros> code was a mess :) .. but well
2011-12-17T07:00:57  <mcstar> mine still is :)
2011-12-17T07:01:07  <ikaros> i tried some languages.. wrote the bot in lua->go->c++11
2011-12-17T07:01:12  <ikaros> and for fun in ruby
2011-12-17T07:01:13  <ikaros> lol
2011-12-17T07:01:17  <mcstar> thats a lot
2011-12-17T07:01:18  <ikaros> which was too slow
2011-12-17T07:01:20  <antimatroid> c++11 ftw
2011-12-17T07:01:31  <ikaros> c++11 is nice BUT
2011-12-17T07:01:36  <mcstar> i wrote it in common lisp, and then in c++ and instantly switched to c++11
2011-12-17T07:01:44  <ikaros> i had to change alot when i did my first submission in c++11
2011-12-17T07:01:49  <ikaros> because the use gcc4.5
2011-12-17T07:01:55  <ikaros> and i used 4.6
2011-12-17T07:01:57  <ikaros> ...
2011-12-17T07:02:17  <antimatroid> ikaros: don't say things like this to me
2011-12-17T07:02:30  <ikaros> better for you :)
2011-12-17T07:02:35  <ikaros> to check it before deadline hehe
2011-12-17T07:02:47  <mcstar> ikaros: uoset and uomap doest have yet have emplace methods even in 4.6
2011-12-17T07:02:49  <ikaros> foreach loops and nullptr type wont work
2011-12-17T07:03:00  <mcstar> -have
2011-12-17T07:03:14  <antimatroid> pretty sure all i'm using is unordered_set and auto
2011-12-17T07:03:29  <ikaros> yea i just didnt think about the servers having an older version of gcc.. (stupid me)
2011-12-17T07:03:31  <antimatroid> mcstar: <3 auto
2011-12-17T07:03:53  <ikaros> 90% im doing my next aichallenge in lua only
2011-12-17T07:03:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: but lambdas arent polymorphic
2011-12-17T07:04:09  <ikaros> it's just the most fun and still so fast
2011-12-17T07:04:58  <mcstar> does lua have a repl?
2011-12-17T07:05:11  <mcstar> (i guess so)
2011-12-17T07:05:32  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-17T07:05:35  <mcstar> stupid question really
2011-12-17T07:05:42  <ikaros> hehe
2011-12-17T07:07:02  <mcstar> i hope by the time of the next challenge i will be able to think in a functional way
2011-12-17T07:07:05  <ikaros> lua itself is really nice but luajit is just a masterpiece.. never seen a jit for a dynamic language that fast.. and it is a one man project.. awesome
2011-12-17T07:07:33  <mcstar> ikaros: clojure?
2011-12-17T07:07:48  <ikaros> ok yea clojure is pretty fast too
2011-12-17T07:07:51  <mcstar> best of lisp + java hotspot
2011-12-17T07:07:53  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-17T07:08:03  <ikaros> i wanted to try that one day.. but never did hehe
2011-12-17T07:08:22  <mcstar> i only went as far as a couple tutorials
2011-12-17T07:08:24  <antimatroid> i want to see someone win with haskell
2011-12-17T07:08:26  <ikaros> did some scheme years ago.. but i liked ocaml more than the lisps in terms of syntax
2011-12-17T07:08:36  <mcstar> oh
2011-12-17T07:08:43  <mcstar> damn, ok, i can take this...
2011-12-17T07:08:47  <ikaros> hehe
2011-12-17T07:09:03  <ikaros> i know most think ocaml has the ugly syntax lol
2011-12-17T07:09:18  <ikaros> brb
2011-12-17T07:09:20  <mcstar> i decided couple days ago i will learn haskell and not ocaml

2011-12-17T07:10:17  <mcstar> cant remember
2011-12-17T07:10:23  <antimatroid> might have been him i think
2011-12-17T07:10:25  <mcstar> one guy, but he was talking in plural
2011-12-17T07:10:29  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-17T07:10:49  <mcstar> i will definitely look at their code
2011-12-17T07:11:02  <antimatroid> i think it's been mostly him in the end
2011-12-17T07:11:16  <antimatroid> a1k0n always does interesting stuff
2011-12-17T07:12:12  <ikaros> pretty excited to see xathis solution
2011-12-17T07:14:19  <UncleVasya> mcstar: why Haskell instead of OCaml?
2011-12-17T07:18:12  <jab_bott> mcstar: you still there? http://paste.aichallenge.org/EwMd9/
2011-12-17T07:18:37  <jab_bott> Just made my bot fight against some older ones on a small map - the replay file is only 13M for that one!
2011-12-17T07:20:37  <yahim91> we can see rhe solutions after the finals?
2011-12-17T07:21:25  <antimatroid> yahim91: a lot of people share their code once submissions close
2011-12-17T07:21:42  <antimatroid> we're yet to not have first place release their code, and i'm pretty sure xathis has said he intents to release his
2011-12-17T07:21:51  <ikaros> jab_bott, i guess the blue boxes are for exploration
2011-12-17T07:22:08  <yahim91> awsome
2011-12-17T07:22:37  <ikaros> how do you decide the specific one "sliding in" again
2011-12-17T07:22:42  <ikaros> if you know what i mean :)
2011-12-17T07:23:30  <bugnuts> you know something thaat would be really awesome would be a thing in the profile where a competitor could tick a "release my code" button
2011-12-17T07:23:41  <ikaros> happening the first time on turn 12 with : 32,77 and 40,82
2011-12-17T07:23:42  <bugnuts> and if ticked the code would be available for download
2011-12-17T07:23:57  <mcstar> was afk
2011-12-17T07:25:10  <mcstar> bugnuts: if you write the ncessary code, they might just merge it
2011-12-17T07:25:32  <bugnuts> yeah maybe after the deadline....
2011-12-17T07:26:49  <jab_bott> ikaros: yeah - blue are start nodes for exploration BFS (not shown) red are combat
2011-12-17T07:27:13  <ikaros> yea
2011-12-17T07:27:25  <ikaros> i had something similar too in the beginning of the contest
2011-12-17T07:27:29  <ikaros> for exploration
2011-12-17T07:27:45  <ikaros> but didnt work out a good way to make previously seen tiles unseen again

2011-12-17T07:29:04  <jab_bott> ikaros: you notice the grid of blue squares marching around - if you turn on fog you'll notice that they line up with the edges fo visible squares - to ensure my ants keep re-exploring seen tiles that are no longer visible
2011-12-17T07:29:51  <stilkin> I wanted to ask when submission closes, it says on the 18th, but at what time ?
2011-12-17T07:30:01  <bugnuts> midnight EST
2011-12-17T07:30:11  <mcstar> -5 utc
2011-12-17T07:30:17  <stilkin> EST will do fine
2011-12-17T07:30:18  <stilkin> ;-)
2011-12-17T07:30:27  <stilkin> (I live in GMT+1)
2011-12-17T07:30:39  <mcstar> +1
2011-12-17T07:31:00  <ikaros> ok jab_bott so your ants have some kind of memory? so they dont jitter between invisible areas?
2011-12-17T07:31:17  <stilkin> wait that didn make any sense >_<
2011-12-17T07:31:20  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590ecd3f.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-17T07:31:55  <jab_bott> ikaros: not really memory as such - they have a "preferred direction" and if all else is equal they will go in that direction, it's reset every time they move so by default they will keep going the same way
2011-12-17T07:31:58  <stilkin> 5AM I guess
2011-12-17T07:32:07  <mcstar> yes

2011-12-17T07:32:40  <stilkin> ;-)
2011-12-17T07:32:40  <ikaros> ok thats what i meant with memory.. you keep track of the ants
2011-12-17T07:32:45  <mcstar> dont aggrevate me bro
2011-12-17T07:32:49  <Zaphus> and right now its ~7:30am EST (17th) right ?
2011-12-17T07:32:54  <mcstar> IM GOING BALLISTIC
2011-12-17T07:32:55  <jab_bott> ikaros: ahh yea - I have an ant object for each one
2011-12-17T07:33:00  <stilkin> mcstar: I wont, just kidding. thanks for the info
2011-12-17T07:33:09  <mcstar> im kidding too
2011-12-17T07:33:12  <ikaros> i canceled that.. each turn brings "fresh" ants now :)

2011-12-17T07:34:29  <jab_bott> ikaros: I don't really use the ant objects for much - they track when they've moved so ants can move on to each other's squares if they know the other will move out of the way
2011-12-17T07:35:16  <mcstar> lol, i remember when i tried to solve that problem in a nice way
2011-12-17T07:35:22  <ikaros> hehe
2011-12-17T07:35:33  <mcstar> i made it more un-understandable with each try
2011-12-17T07:35:46  <mcstar> finally i went with a simple alg. that just works
2011-12-17T07:35:49  <stilkin> sounds familiar
2011-12-17T07:35:51  <mcstar> even if not optimally
2011-12-17T07:35:54  <ikaros> my newest version does that by sorting all ants commands by scores
2011-12-17T07:36:07  <ikaros> previously i just recursively pushed them away

2011-12-17T07:42:33  <jab_bott> mcstar: yeah - you have to keep disabling large parts of it if you want anything that doesn't take forever
2011-12-17T07:42:40  <mcstar> and its not even a full board
2011-12-17T07:43:00  <mcstar> for the next contest, i opt for a binary interface
2011-12-17T07:43:16  <mcstar> so you wont have to parse test
2011-12-17T07:43:18  <mcstar> text*
2011-12-17T07:44:03  <jab_bott> mcstar: that's the price of using the existing visualizer though - I already spent long enough on the ai-state visualization, I'm sure it helped loads of people though so I don't resent the time.. pity I didn't have long left to work on my bot though
2011-12-17T07:44:07  <mcstar> and maybe you should add a full array visualizer
2011-12-17T07:44:33  <mcstar> i.e. expect values to be rgba numbers, that span a nxm matrix
2011-12-17T07:45:00  <UncleVasya> mcstar: why do you choose Haskell instead of OCaml?
2011-12-17T07:45:02  <mcstar> im just giving you ideas for the next contest
2011-12-17T07:45:14  <mcstar> i understand you spent much time with this, which is appreciated

2011-12-17T07:46:19  <jab_bott> mcstar: yeah - well maybe we can do something really useful for the next challenge and get it incorporated into the game code and visualizer from early on

2011-12-17T07:48:05  <mcstar> UncleVasya: if i want a functional language, why not go with a strict one, and haskell has monads, which i find interesting, and has MANY implementations, ocaml has only one, and the type system is better, and i dont want to put up with those kind  of numerical operator bs that ocaml has, and the haskell community is growing, and there are some very smart people in there, and it is lazy, which i find
2011-12-17T07:48:07  <mcstar> also interesting, and

2011-12-17T07:51:27  <UncleVasya> You need to talk with Smilry. He will motivate you to make the right choise :)
2011-12-17T07:51:34  <mcstar> in what part are ocaml obejcts immutable?

2011-12-17T07:52:21  <UncleVasya> Haskell is too obvious...
2011-12-17T07:52:28  <matthewd> Speaking of the visualizer... I found this cut down the delay between the game finishing and the browser launching: https://gist.github.com/1490137

2011-12-17T07:52:53  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you are an unpurposeful commenter
2011-12-17T07:53:15  <mcstar> he means haskell isnt obscure enough
2011-12-17T07:53:24  <mcstar> but has i wanted obscure i would learn J
2011-12-17T07:53:40  <mcstar> that language has a VOCABULARY
2011-12-17T07:53:47  <pairofdice> Sounds like hipster talk
2011-12-17T07:54:29  <mcstar> J has 2 tables of 1 character operator vocabulary, each character has 3 different meaning depending on context and punctuation

2011-12-17T07:54:51  <pairofdice> gist is the Git pastebin

2011-12-17T07:56:57  <pairofdice> idiom
2011-12-17T07:57:05  <UncleVasya> I understand but
2011-12-17T07:57:09  <matthewd> I didn't particularly prove it, but I think the problem is that the .sub() call means after swapping in the massive debug output into the HTML, the regexp then has to scan through all of it
2011-12-17T07:57:13  <UncleVasya> choose for what, use for what?
2011-12-17T07:57:24  <mcstar> you want an obscure language right?
2011-12-17T07:57:25  <jab_bott> matthewd: is that modification from my vis overlay branch/fork?
2011-12-17T07:57:40  <mcstar> pls explain then what did you mean by "Haskell is too obvious..."
2011-12-17T07:57:53  <mcstar> and what quality did you find in ocaml that made you choose that language
2011-12-17T07:57:58  <UncleVasya> I wanted when I was choosing languahe for Ants.
2011-12-17T07:58:12  <UncleVasya> I do not choose language for something right now.
2011-12-17T07:58:17  <matthewd> jab_bott: I don't think your branch differs there, but yes -- I needed it because with a bunch of vis (and esp. info) was just making the output enormous
2011-12-17T07:58:28  <jab_bott> matthewd: I noticed some dodgy escaping in the JSON that gets embedded in the HTML - it doesn't handle spaces in strings well at all
2011-12-17T07:58:30  <mcstar> pairofdice: can you understand me?
2011-12-17T07:58:50  <matthewd> jab_bott: Yeah, the space stripping is there too.
2011-12-17T07:59:08  <pairofdice> mcstar, possibility is there
2011-12-17T07:59:36  <UncleVasya> mcstar: By too obvious I mean that when somebody start thinking about functional way, the first thing he hear is Haskell.
2011-12-17T07:59:41  <matthewd> jab_bott: I suspect it only exists to avoid useless bytes in the output, though I didn't investigate
2011-12-17T07:59:56  <jab_bott> matthewd: probably a bit late to worry about that now anyway :/ - personally I never made much use of the info command, though I did use it a couple of times very sparingly due to the slow speed
2011-12-17T08:00:00  <mcstar> UncleVasya: theres a reason for that probably
2011-12-17T08:00:18  <mcstar> but its not logical to choose ocaml just because you hear too much of haskell
2011-12-17T08:00:38  <mcstar> pairofdice: it was just a check to see if i make sense
2011-12-17T08:01:09  <pairofdice> I think he just wanted a language he had no experience with for Ants
2011-12-17T08:01:25  <mcstar> there are thousands of such languages
2011-12-17T08:01:33  <mcstar> he must have a reson
2011-12-17T08:01:33  <pairofdice> But you can only pick one
2011-12-17T08:01:47  <mcstar> or, must have had

2011-12-17T08:04:34  <UncleVasya> I was inspired to learn something about functional programming.
2011-12-17T08:05:32  <UncleVasya> I did some googling and found that F# is most suitable for me.
2011-12-17T08:05:53  <UncleVasya> Then I came here and asked about F# support.
2011-12-17T08:06:09  <mcstar> f# is multi paradigm
2011-12-17T08:06:29  <UncleVasya> Smiley said there is no support for F# but if I wanna touch the functional way I can use OCaml.
2011-12-17T08:06:37  <mcstar> what?
2011-12-17T08:06:41  <mcstar> no support for it?
2011-12-17T08:06:47  <mcstar> i find that hard to believe
2011-12-17T08:07:04  <mcstar> its not different than c# in support
2011-12-17T08:07:32  <dmj111> its been awhile since I have tried, but using F# on mono has been a pain so far.

2011-12-17T08:24:55  <jab_bott> mcstar: heh - mine si very dumb - it just works out enemy possible moves based on water, 'draws' a map of where they can go, runs an edge-detection on it to get safe spots surrounding the enemy ants, BFS to find my ants towards those spots... then from the enemy ant POV I calculate if it's scared from a particular direction and erase the coverage map from that direction so my ants pile in
2011-12-17T08:25:06  <mcstar> i spent too much time on enumeration/full battle resolution and evaluation
2011-12-17T08:25:45  <mcstar> no comment XD
2011-12-17T08:25:58  <jab_bott> mcstar: it kind of works when my ants are lined up, but fron an angle it's really bad

2011-12-17T08:27:09  <mcstar> no mocking

2011-12-17T08:28:50  <mcstar> aikon has, admittedly a simple bot
2011-12-17T08:29:00  <mcstar> and he is #3

2011-12-17T08:29:30  <pairofdice> Is #2
2011-12-17T08:29:52  <mcstar> ok, i cant keep up with rankings
2011-12-17T08:30:24  <dmj111> mcstar: sorry, had to walk away.  Re: F#, yes it was slower, tail calls weren't right (but might be now), and the interactive shell had lots of problems.  It would crash on valid code.
2011-12-17T08:31:10  <dmj111> it may be much better now, and Microsoft's lead F# guy said that they are working hard to make sure its ok on Mono.
2011-12-17T08:32:02  <dmj111> That being said... if there was as starter pack for it a month ago, I might have used it.

2011-12-17T10:33:04  <rwest_> lol the tutorial map is on tcpants
2011-12-17T10:34:25  <BenJackson> tcpclient needs a graceful shutdown
2011-12-17T10:36:50  <TL_> BenJackson: you mean killing the bot process?
2011-12-17T10:37:04  <BenJackson> then you timeout/lose
2011-12-17T10:37:59  <Minthos> would be nice to have a way to tell tcpclient 'shutdown when current game ends'
2011-12-17T10:38:12  <Minthos> but tbh it's not important
2011-12-17T10:38:22  <Minthos> a few timeouts are no biggie
2011-12-17T10:38:43  <BenJackson> last time I did it my bot dropped from 1st to 3rd on tcpants because it dropped 3 quick games

2011-12-17T10:58:03  <jab_bott> ok, so my v7 bot got to 460th in 9 games - just uploaded v8, let's hope it does a bit better/faster as I'm runningout of time :P
2011-12-17T10:58:23  <BenJackson> sorry, it takes a long time to rank up on the official server
2011-12-17T10:58:33  <BenJackson> and how fast you go is kind of random
2011-12-17T10:58:50  <BenJackson> let's suppose I'm top 10.  I could win a game vs #100 (probably) from position 7800
2011-12-17T10:58:53  <BenJackson> but it won't give me that game
2011-12-17T10:59:06  <BenJackson> one time I played a bunch in a row against #1000+
2011-12-17T10:59:10  <BenJackson> and you just don't get points for that
2011-12-17T10:59:17  <jab_bott> yeah - I want to fight some of the better bots so I can see how my combat code does (I only wrote it last night after scrapping a previous attampt at a more complex system - and improved it today)
2011-12-17T11:01:14  <jab_bott> 9 games overnight isn't bad I guess - I just wish I could fight top 500 bots to start with - not to get ranking, but to see how my fights go in the real world (since testing against my old bots is prone to over-fitting specific cases)
2011-12-17T11:01:32  <BenJackson> I assume you're on tcp too

2011-12-17T11:02:36  <BenJackson> bhickey is intentionally aiming at a lower bar
2011-12-17T11:02:43  <jab_bott> I was planning to do this ai-class final exam and let my v8 bot have some battles
2011-12-17T11:02:46  <BenJackson> I will adjust what I'm running there if you have requests
2011-12-17T11:03:23  <jab_bott> do those servers grab bot binaries from the official server or something?
2011-12-17T11:04:04  <BenJackson> no, you run on your machine
2011-12-17T11:04:16  <BenJackson> bot interaction is over tcp
2011-12-17T11:04:29  <BenJackson> it's like 'play_one_game' but with remote participants
2011-12-17T11:04:37  <BenJackson> here's a game I just watched: http://tcpants.com/replay.2883
2011-12-17T11:04:50  <BenJackson> I am super pleased with what my bot did because that map has that weird dead space
2011-12-17T11:04:56  <BenJackson> and it handled that perfectly
2011-12-17T11:06:56  <jab_bott> isn't dead-space against the spec.?
2011-12-17T11:08:24  <jab_bott> oh I see - you mean no targets reachable rather than the space itself not reachable
2011-12-17T11:09:14  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-17T11:09:28  <BenJackson> I know the first time I saw that map I put way too many ants in there
2011-12-17T11:09:42  <BenJackson> at this point my bot even knows that enemie can't come from there
2011-12-17T11:09:56  <jab_bott> wow - impressive
2011-12-17T11:10:05  <jab_bott> very effective use of the ants you do have
2011-12-17T11:10:36  <jab_bott> I notice at move 592, a cluster of ants around BenJackson (16, 102) are discovering that it's dead and turn back immediately
2011-12-17T11:11:26  <jab_bott> your battle code looks amazing too - you seem to come out better off most times
2011-12-17T11:12:24  <BenJackson> if I have any advantage it's that my implementation is totally different than everyone else's
2011-12-17T11:13:04  <jab_bott> why's that?
2011-12-17T11:13:38  <BenJackson> well I'm not using min-max and I'm not using the "simple combat" from the forum
2011-12-17T11:13:49  <BenJackson> I doubt anyone cloned a1k0n successfully :)
2011-12-17T11:14:43  <itzkow> when I first read a1k0n's post I promised myself to fully understand his post in the future, but that never happened...
2011-12-17T11:15:06  <jab_bott> oh - I just made some stuff up - dunno what the 'simple combat' does - so I might be doing something similar

2011-12-17T11:16:23  <BenJackson> but I have to fix that exploration bug
2011-12-17T11:16:51  <jab_bott> my combat is calculate enemy-attackable squares for next turn, edge-detect to find initial frontier for BFS, charge my ants to those locations, then some crappy logic to check if the enemy ant is in danger from my ants and if so kill his attack field so my ants pile in
2011-12-17T11:17:19  <TL_> managed to impelement a1k0n's method, same with memetix. but it needs a lot of tuning and i don't have time anymore. even implemented a technique described by benjackson.

2011-12-17T11:18:39  <jab_bott> BenJackson: so that post lists tcp servers - how do I run a game against one of them?
2011-12-17T11:18:51  <BenJackson> go to one of them and see "Howto"
2011-12-17T11:18:57  <BenJackson> basically download a tcpclient.py
2011-12-17T11:19:17  <BenJackson> run tcpclient.py host port YOUR_BOT user pass
2011-12-17T11:19:30  <BenJackson> host part include:  fluxid.pl 2081, tcpants.com 2081, bhickey.net 2081
2011-12-17T11:19:41  <BenJackson> the latter was intended for newcomers because fluxid got too tough
2011-12-17T11:19:53  <BenJackson> fluxid is now overloaded, everything is timing out, db is getting corrupted
2011-12-17T11:21:31  <itzkow> I have a known bug where if a food pops next to my ant, it may cause collision between two of my ants, but that's quite rare I believe
2011-12-17T11:22:03  <BenJackson> yeah, I had to special case that
2011-12-17T11:22:44  <jab_bott> BenJackson: ahh - duh! I was thinking it literally just talked ant-speak and didn't even think of going there from a browser (despite the separate link!)

2011-12-17T11:39:37  <BenJackson> I only remember because I was confused last time by two sequential games where I played people named "6"-something
2011-12-17T11:39:47  <UncleVasya> jab_bott: it's time to call and back them to reality.
2011-12-17T11:39:57  <jab_bott> awesome!! BenJackson: if I specify num_rounds will it do that many games then finish? So I could say like 5 rounds then come back later?
2011-12-17T11:40:24  <UncleVasya> jab_bott: you can use -1
2011-12-17T11:40:33  <BenJackson> if you don't say it will go forever
2011-12-17T11:40:36  <BenJackson> but yes
2011-12-17T11:40:39  <UncleVasya> for continuing testing
2011-12-17T11:40:47  <rwest_> if you don't put it, it does 1 game
2011-12-17T11:40:49  <UncleVasya> *continious
2011-12-17T11:41:06  <UncleVasya> or something like that, when there is no game limith
2011-12-17T11:41:41  <jab_bott> I don't see my game in the games list?

2011-12-17T11:42:59  <BenJackson> arrr I still fail to take hills when they're offered super early
2011-12-17T11:43:26  <jab_bott> ahh there it is.. BenJackson http://tcpants.com/replay.2916
2011-12-17T11:44:50  <jab_bott> ahhh - the game was still going on after I died so I was disconnected
2011-12-17T11:44:56  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-17T11:45:06  <BenJackson> good news is you will connect and start another game at that point
2011-12-17T11:45:07  <BenJackson> if it's looping
2011-12-17T11:45:21  <BenJackson> so you can actually lose games faster than you can win them :)
2011-12-17T11:46:16  <jab_bott> um... I notice some people are running multiple bots - are they running them all locally or can you upload some?
2011-12-17T11:46:39  <BenJackson> they're running them all locally
2011-12-17T11:46:42  <BenJackson> multiple invocations of the client
2011-12-17T11:47:03  <BenJackson> I'm running about 4 right now, one on tcpants, I think one on fluxid (if it hasn't died) and 2 on bhickey
2011-12-17T11:47:06  <jab_bott> it's really cool! thanks for telling me to look into it immediately!
2011-12-17T11:47:10  <BenJackson> the latter two are for other people to play
2011-12-17T11:47:11  <BenJackson> old versions
2011-12-17T11:47:35  <jab_bott> I'll try one against bhickey - see how I get on
2011-12-17T11:48:45  <BenJackson> you'd be the only person "developing" there so if you're getting flattened I can dial it back

2011-12-17T11:50:03  <BenJackson> wow, looking at the graph I wouldn't expect it to be close
2011-12-17T11:50:38  <BenJackson> ah, your surround of his base was a bit leaky
2011-12-17T11:50:43  <amstan> what happened with flag? he's way down
2011-12-17T11:51:34  <besh> wow .. do you have code that favours attacking when turn limit gets close ?
2011-12-17T11:52:08  <BenJackson> someone does pay attention to that
2011-12-17T11:52:24  <BenJackson> I've seen ChrisH's bot go catatonic when it realizes it can't get meaningful ants to the battle
2011-12-17T11:52:26  <BenJackson> because there's no time
2011-12-17T11:52:46  <Fluxid> besh: no. my ants only go kamikaze when all hills are down

2011-12-17T11:53:28  <Fluxid> i think it started to choke because of turn time limit, if that happens combat slowly starts to malfunction (so by paradox it starts to be more offensive, lol)
2011-12-17T11:54:13  <itzkow> nice game
2011-12-17T11:54:30  <besh> I see iterative refinement of combat moves gets poorer

2011-12-17T11:54:37  <itzkow> I had a similar game where I could have won if I had 2 more turns

2011-12-17T11:55:03  <BenJackson> ok, 36 hours
2011-12-17T11:55:10  <jab_bott> Fluxid: when you can see alost 100% of the map and you know you've got like 10x more ants than them - you can probably afford to lose a few
2011-12-17T11:55:14  <BenJackson> game rate about 82
2011-12-17T11:55:16  <BenJackson> 26 more games
2011-12-17T11:55:17  <besh> this contestbot drops some funny lines from time to time ;)
2011-12-17T11:55:18  <jab_bott> so just pile in
2011-12-17T11:55:22  <BenJackson> so nope, no way any submit at this point will settle
2011-12-17T11:55:36  * avdg wonders how many people will send their bot in the last 12 hours
2011-12-17T11:55:39  <Fluxid> jab_bott: i wanted to implement that logic

2011-12-17T11:55:49  <contestbot> besh: I'm sorry Dave, err besh; I cannot 'Hello'.
2011-12-17T11:55:51  <BenJackson> avdg: I didn't even want to do it today, but I had to fix a bug
2011-12-17T11:55:56  <Fluxid> when mine blob is bigger than enemy blob: attack
2011-12-17T11:56:04  <BenJackson> I did that (blob)
2011-12-17T11:56:11  <BenJackson> but I didn't use my knowledge that I see all enemies
2011-12-17T11:56:23  <BenJackson> I fear too many special cases, no matter how clever they are
2011-12-17T11:56:32  <Fluxid> but i got problems with combat in general and then got crazy
2011-12-17T11:56:34  <Fluxid> lazy*
2011-12-17T11:56:52  <praveen> the latest code uploaded will be used for the trounament right? and I believe I still have 1.5 days to upload another one
2011-12-17T11:57:39  <BenJackson> yes

2011-12-17T11:57:47  <praveen> ok
2011-12-17T11:58:00  <itzkow> my bot gets aggressive when most of the map is explored, which is kinda good with 1on1 battles
2011-12-17T11:58:04  <BenJackson> but personally I think I will only just see enough games to feel comfortable
2011-12-17T11:58:24  <BenJackson> if I subbed in the final hours I'd be sleepless until the finals
2011-12-17T11:58:27  <avdg> meh, I tried to find the worst bot, it looks like that bot is a starter bot as well (and its even not timing out), oh well...
2011-12-17T11:58:36  <avdg> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=10043
2011-12-17T11:58:48  <avdg> .12 rank and rising
2011-12-17T11:58:54  <BenJackson> avdg: Fluxid though he saw signs of life around rank 2000
2011-12-17T11:59:22  <Fluxid> i think i stabilized around skill 84.5
2011-12-17T11:59:45  <itzkow> why would someone upload the starter bot?
2011-12-17T11:59:50  <avdg> well, one of my previous bots dropped from 1500 to 2k at a certain time (not even a few weeks ago)
2011-12-17T11:59:56  <BenJackson> itzkow: it tells you to do that
2011-12-17T12:00:06  <Fluxid> the tutorial
2011-12-17T12:00:11  <itzkow> oh right
2011-12-17T12:00:17  <itzkow> well
2011-12-17T12:00:31  <a1k0n> how did i end up ahead of pguillory?  haha
2011-12-17T12:00:32  <itzkow> since there are 6000 starter bots out of 8000
2011-12-17T12:00:38  <BenJackson> my last two bots finished with identical mu
2011-12-17T12:00:43  <BenJackson> but that's certainly not "true"
2011-12-17T12:00:52  <Fluxid> anyway, there were cases of bots worse than starter bots... because they timeouted on gathering food which caused them to loose points andfail
2011-12-17T12:01:12  <a1k0n> i wonder how many more times flagcapper is going to resubmit.. sheesh
2011-12-17T12:01:12  <itzkow> maybe pguillory is prepearing something, he hasn't uploaded a new bot in a while
2011-12-17T12:01:23  <a1k0n> i haven't either, but i'm not preparing anything
2011-12-17T12:01:49  <a1k0n> i'm afraid to touch it at this stage as i have no idea why it's working so well
2011-12-17T12:01:49  <Fluxid> at some point pguillory said he has something special which he didn't enabled
2011-12-17T12:01:51  <BenJackson> ChrisH was the one trying everything for an advantage
2011-12-17T12:02:04  <a1k0n> he has enemy behavior prediction
2011-12-17T12:02:09  <ikaros> rankings seem a bit out of control when lots of players keep resubmitting
2011-12-17T12:02:11  <a1k0n> but i think that's as likely to hurt as it is to help

2011-12-17T12:02:45  <itzkow> my new bot has enemy prediction behaviour
2011-12-17T12:02:46  <BenJackson> so it takes almost exactly 80 skill to get in the top 100 now
2011-12-17T12:02:57  <Fluxid> ok, who bets xathis will be able to get skill 100 before finals?
2011-12-17T12:03:24  <BenJackson> itzkow: so does mine, as long as you only include moving (somewhere) and not moving
2011-12-17T12:03:32  <BenJackson> with a slight bias against expecting them to suicide

2011-12-17T12:03:44  <itzkow> interesting

2011-12-17T12:04:23  <besh> Q is as good as xathis on fluxid but the latter didnt play games recently.
2011-12-17T12:04:29  <BenJackson> or I guess 7 is up?  5 and 7 then
2011-12-17T12:04:32  <jab_bott> BenJackson: sure - lemmie have a god :P
2011-12-17T12:04:40  <itzkow> who is Q?

2011-12-17T12:05:10  <Fluxid> BenJackson: i know buuuuut
2011-12-17T12:05:12  <BenJackson> you have to look at every game to know if anything useful happened
2011-12-17T12:05:30  <Fluxid> it's kind of fun watching how he climbs up with mu over 100
2011-12-17T12:05:45  <BenJackson> my new bot has won 8 in a row on tcpants, woo woo
2011-12-17T12:06:32  <itzkow> I'm not sure how good is xathis on 1v1 battles
2011-12-17T12:06:37  <Fluxid> i wonder if playing same games with different order results with the same skill
2011-12-17T12:06:46  <BenJackson> Fluxid: I was wondering the same thing
2011-12-17T12:06:57  <BenJackson> when I played 10+ games practically at once due to a matchup glitch
2011-12-17T12:07:04  <Fluxid> i guess not, because one can start to improve after some time
2011-12-17T12:07:22  <BenJackson> I have to think order matters
2011-12-17T12:12:22  <itzkow> sometimes I lose, but I can't blame my bot
2011-12-17T12:12:43  <itzkow> I get angry on other bots who act wierd
2011-12-17T12:13:06  <itzkow> :/
2011-12-17T12:13:12  <BenJackson> itzkow: I've found it especially rewarding to reliably win games that early on I would have disregarded as unwinnable

2011-12-17T12:14:48  <itzkow> how can you give advantage to a bot?
2011-12-17T12:15:02  <BenJackson> lots of ways
2011-12-17T12:15:10  <BenJackson> play a map where bots are paired up, give one a weak opponent
2011-12-17T12:15:27  <BenJackson> I have a hack in ants.py that lets me tell all bots where the hills of a given target are
2011-12-17T12:15:30  <BenJackson> on every turn
2011-12-17T12:15:47  <BenJackson> delay the start of one by a few turns
2011-12-17T12:16:08  <BenJackson> tune an old bot to be suicidally aggressive and put it next to the test bot

2011-12-17T12:16:55  <BenJackson> pretty much every iteration of bot I've submitted can soundly beat the previous bot and mostly beat any combination of all prior versions

2011-12-17T12:20:51  <rebelxt> agreed ants was as good or even better than planetwars. wish i had time to give it a go
2011-12-17T12:21:36  <itzkow> planet wars was 1v1?
2011-12-17T12:22:06  <UncleVasya> yes
2011-12-17T12:22:14  <rebelxt> itzkow: yep
2011-12-17T12:22:20  <itzkow> tron and planet wars could have been more than just 1v1, I wonder why it hasn't
2011-12-17T12:22:30  <UncleVasya> Ants is the first multiplayer game
2011-12-17T12:22:51  <BenJackson> multiplayer is fun to watch
2011-12-17T12:23:07  <BenJackson> but I think we're burning a lot of cpu on games that don't tell us much about the relative strengths of the players
2011-12-17T12:23:09  <itzkow> yeah, but 1v1 ants is quite diffrent
2011-12-17T12:23:30  <BenJackson> I suppose the uncertainty does mean we need combat
2011-12-17T12:23:30  <rebelxt> itzkow: concern was that multi-player games in planetwars would result in deadlocks when noone wants to attack first and lose
2011-12-17T12:23:34  <BenJackson> in 1v1 you could trade
2011-12-17T12:23:41  <UncleVasya> Maybe because organizers only started to do this contest and were scary but multiplayer complications.
2011-12-17T12:23:57  <itzkow> I see
2011-12-17T12:24:31  <rebelxt> planetwars 2v2 team games would be awesome though
2011-12-17T12:24:45  <itzkow> I knew the game tron as a multiplayer so I was surprised to see they only did 1v1

2011-12-17T14:21:39  <_flag> antimatroid: Both those things involve math, but probably not pure math
2011-12-17T14:21:45  <_flag> So there will be math in it
2011-12-17T14:21:52  <antimatroid> i went crazy in undergrad and did cs, economics and pure maths majors
2011-12-17T14:22:12  <_flag> sashaSochka: I don't even know; probably something nearby and nothing too special
2011-12-17T14:22:19  <_flag> So for me that would be Western or Waterloo
2011-12-17T14:22:24  <antimatroid> _flag: not waterloo? it has a good rep
2011-12-17T14:22:31  <antimatroid> well, i had heard of it before this
2011-12-17T14:22:32  <bmh> Waterloo = something special

2011-12-17T14:26:40  <bmh> sashaSochka: Have you read CLRS or The Algorithm Design Manual?
2011-12-17T14:26:52  <sashaSochka> no
2011-12-17T14:27:24  <sashaSochka> I haven't even heared about it yet
2011-12-17T14:27:47  <antimatroid> CLRS is the MIT algo book yeah?
2011-12-17T14:27:57  <sashaSochka> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms
2011-12-17T14:27:59  <bmh> antimatroid: yeah. It's what I used as an undergrad. Blew my mind.
2011-12-17T14:28:03  <antimatroid> i have a copy of that across my room somewhere
2011-12-17T14:28:33  <antimatroid> my uni would never use a book like that :(
2011-12-17T14:28:48  <antimatroid> the maths school rocks, everything else is pretty crap
2011-12-17T14:29:06  <sashaSochka> like TSAP ot CLRS?
2011-12-17T14:29:08  <mleise> oh cool, the contest has a netherland's sponsor now
2011-12-17T14:29:37  <sashaSochka> taop*(the art of programming)
2011-12-17T14:29:47  <antimatroid> haven't looked at TAOP, but they wouldn't touch CLRS
2011-12-17T14:30:23  <antimatroid> they did have an advanced algo's course for people who hd'd algo's which was pretty decent
2011-12-17T14:30:27  <antimatroid> but still used minimal maths
2011-12-17T14:31:48  <sashaSochka> well, I'm leaving you. Need to do my school math)
2011-12-17T14:32:16  <bmh> I hope janzert comes around. I'm not going to try implementing combat until I know if my bot can compile.

2011-12-17T14:36:07  <antimatroid> jimi_hendrix: use the test_bot.sh thing in tools

2011-12-17T15:29:25  <bmh> janzert: given the old haskell compiler you're using and the lack of the standard haskell libs, I can't build my bot on prod :)
2011-12-17T15:29:39  <janzert> :(
2011-12-17T15:29:47  <bmh> can I give you a binary?
2011-12-17T15:30:30  <bmh> I should have tested earlier, but I didn't want to place load on the servers and then forgot..
2011-12-17T15:30:30  <janzert> the library package was broken at the time (don't know if it's fixed now or not, but can't add it at this point)
2011-12-17T15:30:32  <janzert> hmm
2011-12-17T15:31:45  <bmh> You could use apt pinning and source ghc from the latest version of ubuntu
2011-12-17T15:31:50  <janzert> are you familiar with the contest compiler system?
2011-12-17T15:31:58  <bmh> not in the slightest.
2011-12-17T15:33:03  <janzert> ok, first the hint if you were; take a look at how scheme language support is implemented
2011-12-17T15:33:11  <janzert> and since you're not, a more exlicit hint
2011-12-17T15:34:06  <janzert> but first double checking that I have it right ;)
2011-12-17T15:34:53  <janzert> ok, if a MyBot.ss file is found it will chmod *.ss files and then run ./MyBot
2011-12-17T15:35:30  <bmh> so are you suggesting that I write a scheme wrapper and hand you a binary blob? ('cause that ain't fun)
2011-12-17T15:35:34  <janzert> so basically for whatever reason and whoever implemented "Scheme" support is really just binary support
2011-12-17T15:35:42  <janzert> don't even need any scheme
2011-12-17T15:35:43  <bmh> ha.
2011-12-17T15:35:53  <bmh> that's broken :)
2011-12-17T15:36:00  <bmh> I'll give it a shot later today
2011-12-17T15:36:12  <janzert> just make a MyBot.ss file with anything in it and include a binary MyBot to run
2011-12-17T15:37:15  <janzert> but you'll be listed as using Scheme of course :/
2011-12-17T15:38:00  <bmh> derp
2011-12-17T15:38:10  <janzert> oh and probably need to upload as a tar file with correct permissions set on the binary already
2011-12-17T15:38:40  <janzert> and of course I've not tested this, but I'm pretty sure it'll work :)
2011-12-17T15:39:25  <bmh> error while loading shared libraries: libgmp.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory turn    0 bot 0 crashed
2011-12-17T15:40:00  <janzert> looks like it works
2011-12-17T15:40:03  <bmh> (Why the hell it's trying to use GMP is beyond my comprehension. I guess the haskell runtime uses it)
2011-12-17T15:40:18  <janzert> can haskell statically compile?
2011-12-17T15:40:30  <janzert> that'd be the easiest solution probably
2011-12-17T15:40:44  <thestinger> bmh: try using -static
2011-12-17T15:40:55  <thestinger> I thought that was the default though
2011-12-17T15:40:57  <bmh> janzert: the binary will be *huge*
2011-12-17T15:41:21  <thestinger> so strip and then upx compress it :P
2011-12-17T15:41:32  <bmh> thestinger: what?
2011-12-17T15:41:41  <thestinger> strip -s MassiveBinary
2011-12-17T15:41:45  <thestinger> gets rid of tons of crap
2011-12-17T15:41:51  <thestinger> then 'upx -9 MassiveBinary'
2011-12-17T15:41:51  <bmh> neat
2011-12-17T15:42:06  <thestinger> upx packs it and then it unpacks at runtime

2011-12-17T16:19:06  <Vaenom> ;)
2011-12-17T16:19:31  <Vaenom> thanks Fluxid
2011-12-17T16:19:49  <thestinger> !source
2011-12-17T16:19:56  <thestinger> aw :(
2011-12-17T16:20:13  <thestinger> sadly contestbot doesn't know how to grab quotes
2011-12-17T16:20:16  <nha> actually not quite, because your sigma gets bumped up a little bit each game
2011-12-17T16:20:26  <nha> at least that's the TrueSkill default
2011-12-17T16:20:36  <nha> so sigma does not go down to 0 in the limit
2011-12-17T16:20:50  <bmh> janzert: sweet -- my girlfriend's laptop is running ubuntu 11.04 i686
2011-12-17T16:20:52  <bmh> maybe this will work
2011-12-17T16:21:01  <Murashka> 7:39:58 ?

2011-12-17T16:21:35  <thestinger> bmh: oh, I think glibc isn
2011-12-17T16:21:37  <Fluxid> nha: sigma bumped up?
2011-12-17T16:21:42  <thestinger> isn't backwards compatible with itself*
2011-12-17T16:21:46  <thestinger> not sure if that would be a problem
2011-12-17T16:21:56  <Fluxid> sigma shoul get smaller every game
2011-12-17T16:22:09  <nha> Fluxid: the default of TrueSkill is to increase your sigma by a small amount for each game, *before* the usual sigma update
2011-12-17T16:22:11  <nha> sure
2011-12-17T16:22:21  <nha> that's the "normal update"
2011-12-17T16:22:29  <janzert> Fluxid: not always
2011-12-17T16:22:42  <Vaenom> is there currently any kind of wisdom about the Fluxid.pl ranks and the aichallenge.org ranks?   what would a Fluxid rank 200 bought you on Aichallenge?   Any comparison any of you can make?
2011-12-17T16:22:46  <nha> and it's possible that the organizers took the sigma increase out, because it doesn't really apply here
2011-12-17T16:22:55  <thestinger> so if xathis lost to 7 starter bots, his sigma would go up? :)
2011-12-17T16:23:20  <nha> thestinger: yes, though that's unrelated to what I meant
2011-12-17T16:24:06  <nha> Fluxid: TrueSkill comes from evaluating the skill of humans, and the skill of humans can change over time. To account for that, TrueSkill increase the sigma of every player by some constant before the real update step
2011-12-17T16:24:20  <janzert> I should probably close irc so I stop using it as an excuse from getting the things needed for finals implemented :P
2011-12-17T16:24:21  <nha> of course it would make sense not to do that for the AI challenge
2011-12-17T16:24:39  <nha> and I haven't checked the TrueSkill implementation used here

2011-12-17T16:32:44  <thestinger> well, fluxid's server is packed with bots that don't play anymore
2011-12-17T16:32:53  <thestinger> so their skill is set in stone
2011-12-17T16:33:38  <janzert> really, the tcp servers should increment everyone's (the whole population) sigma after each game

2011-12-17T16:46:43  <nha> unless it's for a game that is popular for some other reason (e.g. StarCraft)
2011-12-17T16:46:57  <Vaenom> on the contrary since the contest would get known with times
2011-12-17T16:47:22  <nha> yes, but if it's always the same thing, the novelty wears off
2011-12-17T16:47:31  <nha> that's why the AI challenge was run with different games each time

2011-12-17T16:48:09  <nha> so in that sense, your wish has already come to pass: there will certainly be another iteration of the contest
2011-12-17T16:48:13  <nha> just not with ants
2011-12-17T16:48:30  <Vaenom> 13,000 contestants is far from being a significant portion of all the people who could possibly enter the contest.
2011-12-17T16:49:04  <nha> but how many of those 13,000 are really serious about it anyway?
2011-12-17T16:49:11  <Vaenom> how many new software engineers are formed _every years_ in universities worldwide?
2011-12-17T16:49:16  <nha> sure
2011-12-17T16:49:23  <nha> that's why you have a regular contest, but with *different* games
2011-12-17T16:49:50  <Vaenom> exactly! so, it's not even 13,000..
2011-12-17T16:49:59  <nha> so that it's equally interesting for both oldtimers and newcomers
2011-12-17T16:50:49  <Vaenom> indeed, but why not accumulate them rather than letting them rot like Tron or Planet War?
2011-12-17T16:51:47  <nha> well, since all the infrastructure is open source, you could always run an "eternal ants challenge" yourself if you feel so inclined
2011-12-17T16:52:24  <pairofdice> Ants require lots of CPU-time tho
2011-12-17T16:52:53  <Vaenom> you always have the latest new "main" contest and you have other permanent tournaments where you can go at any time and learn..
2011-12-17T16:53:32  <BenJackson> looks like it's a good thing I resubmitting this morning
2011-12-17T16:53:46  <BenJackson> my updaed version on tcpants has a mu 4 higher

2011-12-17T17:05:14  <BenJackson> same idea
2011-12-17T17:05:45  <BenJackson> I gave up on fluxid because there are so many timeouts that it's hard to tell if you won or lost a game
2011-12-17T17:05:47  <Vaenom> ok, but who runs it?
2011-12-17T17:05:53  <BenJackson> and I'm not really analyzing micro stuff like combat anymore
2011-12-17T17:06:00  <BenJackson> I'd have to check the forum post
2011-12-17T17:06:22  <BenJackson> I finally had an idea of how to make an acrylic "trophy" for ants

2011-12-17T17:06:45  <Vaenom> I'll try it. What's the turntime at tcpants.com?
2011-12-17T17:06:54  <janzert> McLeopold: great, thank you
2011-12-17T17:06:55  <BenJackson> 500ms
2011-12-17T17:07:04  <BenJackson> only strange thing about tcpants is a 750 turn limit
2011-12-17T17:07:08  <McLeopold> janzert: next, I'll do the script for generating final maps
2011-12-17T17:07:11  <BenJackson> but then fluxid is on 1500 instead of 1000 so
2011-12-17T17:07:45  <janzert> sounds good
2011-12-17T17:07:45  <thestinger> http://tcpants.com/replay.3217 this map is srsly awful

2011-12-17T17:08:26  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-17T17:08:29  <BenJackson> and I later busted you out by altering the local area

2011-12-17T17:10:31  <BenJackson> considering my opponents there are all ranked about 1000 the competition really has heated up
2011-12-17T17:10:38  <Vaenom> Fluxid: ah!  and why the 1500 turn limit?   wouldn't there be less timeouts and such if you would reduce it to 1000?

2011-12-17T17:14:37  <BenJackson> not only didi I get 4 quick games, the latest 3 were against players in the 100s so I'm up to 289 after only 7 games

2011-12-17T17:16:31  <janzert> you were only seed in the first one btw, so no scheduler error involved
2011-12-17T17:16:43  <Vaenom> BenJackson: but if you're 5 < p < 15, then who are those higher in the top 1000 on tcpants?   please don't tell me there's hundreds of secret elite bots not yet on aichallenge :P
2011-12-17T17:16:57  <BenJackson> janzert: then I feel sorry for the seed ;-)
2011-12-17T17:17:18  <BenJackson> Vaenom: I just resubmitted so I played a bunch of 1000s on the way up
2011-12-17T17:17:28  <BenJackson> but those guys at 1000 are better than I remember from previous climbs
2011-12-17T17:17:32  <Vaenom> Fluxid: indeed not a good idea then, yes
2011-12-17T17:17:48  <BenJackson> I wish I'd known abuot the tcpclient/server problems earlier
2011-12-17T17:17:55  <janzert> you did get rather lucky with your first pairing but you were actually highest mu in the second two
2011-12-17T17:17:57  <BenJackson> I would have fixed them
2011-12-17T17:18:08  <janzert> so if anything the others were too low of rank
2011-12-17T17:18:27  <thestinger> so, my bot is great on huge maps
2011-12-17T17:18:31  <thestinger> but it sucks on the little tiny ones
2011-12-17T17:18:31  <BenJackson> janzert: I am assuming that games show up in the list in the order started
2011-12-17T17:18:37  <BenJackson> but that mu is recomputed in the order finished?
2011-12-17T17:18:38  <janzert> nope
2011-12-17T17:18:50  <Fluxid> i have huge disgust to this code, so doing anything in it makes me sad and suicidal
2011-12-17T17:19:00  <janzert> games are in order they finish

2011-12-17T17:19:25  <Fluxid> i'll try to make tcp server from scratch my way
2011-12-17T17:19:29  <janzert> but you're right the mu doesn't necessarily reflect what it was at pairing time
2011-12-17T17:19:30  <Fluxid> next challenge*
2011-12-17T17:19:37  <thestinger> Fluxid: stackless python!
2011-12-17T17:19:53  <BenJackson> janzert: I assume they all started with the same (lowest) mu because of the tight spacing of the games
2011-12-17T17:19:57  <Vaenom> Ben: yes, I remember when getting in the 400s on aichallenge was only a matter of collecting food in mobs and "snaking" to hills..   1 hour and you'd have one such bot.  Now, not so much.
2011-12-17T17:20:04  <BenJackson> I guess you have the matchups stored somewhere?
2011-12-17T17:20:09  <BenJackson> or is that lost when games start?
2011-12-17T17:20:37  <janzert> yeah, you're probably right
2011-12-17T17:21:05  <thestinger> yeah, combat used to get you into the top 25
2011-12-17T17:21:06  <janzert> so first and last games you were paired with a higher mu
2011-12-17T17:21:15  <janzert> middle game a little lower

2011-12-17T18:55:09  <thestinger> bmh: ouch :(
2011-12-17T18:55:11  <dragonfyre13> was ~ 31k elements in my array

2011-12-17T18:55:42  <dragonfyre13> :D
2011-12-17T18:55:53  <dragonfyre13> I was using a 16 bit int for a couple things, now using 32
2011-12-17T18:56:28  <dragonfyre13> it overflowed (signed) with the high values based on map size, so I totally just sat by my hill and bounced back and forth

2011-12-17T18:59:00  <dragonfyre13> I have to deal with TCL at work, and let's just say it's a very special brand of hell.
2011-12-17T18:59:07  <bmh> thestinger: what are you doing for combat?
2011-12-17T18:59:17  <dragonfyre13> bmh: way better than TCL.
2011-12-17T18:59:32  <thestinger> first, I partition the map into battles
2011-12-17T18:59:46  <dragonfyre13> bmh: how about a colonoscopy where they keep you awake, no numbing, and they use a garden hose? Still better than TCL.
2011-12-17T18:59:49  <thestinger> well, this is also after I've come up with all my moves basically
2011-12-17T19:00:21  <thestinger> I do 'come up with good/neutral moves' -> 'do moves that won't affect combat' -> combat -> do rest of moves
2011-12-17T19:00:25  <bmh> thestinger: you doing some memetix magic?
2011-12-17T19:00:27  <thestinger> so I have a hash table with orders
2011-12-17T19:00:41  <thestinger> well, I originally started with something like a payoff matrix
2011-12-17T19:00:48  <thestinger> and then threw in some of the memetix magic type stuff
2011-12-17T19:00:52  <thestinger> it'
2011-12-17T19:00:55  <thestinger> it's alright*
2011-12-17T19:01:29  <thestinger> I use the memetix stuff to pick out an offensive set of moves for each battle
2011-12-17T19:01:41  <thestinger> I either do offense or defense (retreating/positioning always happen)
2011-12-17T19:02:19  <thestinger> I pick offense/defense based on whichever maximizes the worst case (I test against unmoving enemies, and a few offensive sets of moves - the payoff matrix part)
2011-12-17T19:02:36  <McLeopold> amstan: ping
2011-12-17T19:02:42  <thestinger> then I have more code to position ants well, to retreat, etc.
2011-12-17T19:02:46  <thestinger> it's not at all ideal
2011-12-17T19:02:48  <amstan> McLeopold: pong
2011-12-17T19:03:01  <McLeopold> amstan: which script generates your maps?
2011-12-17T19:03:10  <amstan> mapgen should do it
2011-12-17T19:03:12  <thestinger> I started on combat way too late and I didn't feel like rewriting my bot to make it better
2011-12-17T19:03:16  <amstan> it has command line options
2011-12-17T19:03:27  <amstan> most of the commands output something for testing purposes though
2011-12-17T19:03:43  <McLeopold> will I get a good variety if I just run it?
2011-12-17T19:05:12  <McLeopold> amstan: will these be called caves?
2011-12-17T19:05:18  <amstan> yes
2011-12-17T19:05:36  <amstan> you might have to play around with the translation_factor if they look weird
2011-12-17T19:05:43  <amstan> but other than that, it should be fine
2011-12-17T19:06:02  <thestinger> bmh: the big flaw in my bot is that it still piles up ants in stalemates
2011-12-17T19:06:39  <bmh> thestinger: I guess I should just open up my source. The bot works, but it doesn't work :)
2011-12-17T19:06:42  <thestinger> I have a fix for it (just changing weighting more) but it doesn't actually improve my bot, and there's no time left to test stuff until it works :P

2011-12-17T20:14:42  <yoden-cloud> sounds similar to what i'm trying
2011-12-17T20:14:44  <bmh> you should be able to iterate this to build up a probabilitiy distribution of the safety of moves

2011-12-17T20:15:14  <yoden-cloud> probability distributions too complicated for me~~
2011-12-17T20:16:37  <bmh> yoden-cloud: don't sell yourself short. All you need to do is take the number of iterations and the number of times that square was safe

2011-12-17T20:17:02  <yoden-cloud> because not all configurations are equal probability

2011-12-17T21:37:31  <TL_> It's not normal. Your bot might not be aware of the time limit

2011-12-17T23:22:47  <yoden> i'm done changing for today
2011-12-17T23:22:48  <ronchaine> I'm just trying to get my bot finished. :|
2011-12-17T23:22:52  <yoden> going to let it run over night
2011-12-17T23:22:57  <yoden> and try to fix up any obvious problems
2011-12-17T23:23:22  <_flag> ChrisH_: Unfortunately I have trouble getting games with top players on tcp, so I have no idea where I stand in relation to everyone else

2011-12-17T23:24:18  <ChrisH_> I'm pretty sure the version I submitted a couple hours ago is my final version. There is one thing I added recently that I may remove if it isn't proving itself tomorrow, but otherwise I'm done.
2011-12-17T23:24:32  <Antimony> I'm still trying to debug my bot
2011-12-17T23:24:35  <ChrisH_> _flag: I'm running my bot on tcpants tonight if you want to try there
2011-12-17T23:24:40  <yoden> it'd be so much more fun if the main server had more power
2011-12-17T23:24:52  <Antimony> by the way, I think your bot misestimates spawning time Chrish
2011-12-17T23:25:04  <yoden> these are algorithms... i selfishly feel they should be ranked in minutes, not days~~
2011-12-17T23:25:05  <Antimony> it thinks ants will spawn 1 turn too eaerly
2011-12-17T23:25:09  <ChrisH_> Antimony: How so?
2011-12-17T23:25:22  <Antimony> just look at the replay you posted
2011-12-17T23:25:23  <_flag> ChrisH_: Okay, I'll play some games there then :)
2011-12-17T23:25:47  <_flag> ChrisH_: Ombedor1, right?
2011-12-17T23:25:52  <ChrisH_> Antimony: are you talking about early in the game or later?
2011-12-17T23:25:56  <ChrisH_> _flag: yes
2011-12-17T23:26:20  <Antimony> early in the game
2011-12-17T23:26:59  <ChrisH_> Antimony: The spawn control is disabled early in the game to allow expansion. Otherwise the initial ants would never step off the hills to get some food.
2011-12-17T23:27:35  <Antimony> no I mean your ants step off the hill one turn too early
2011-12-17T23:27:40  <Antimony> it looks like they're expecting a spawn
2011-12-17T23:27:48  <Antimony> or they step onto the hill one turn too early
2011-12-17T23:28:05  *** avdg <avdg!~avdg@78-22-168-200.access.telenet.be> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-12-17T23:28:15  <Antimony> remember, there's a 1 turn delay between collecting food and spawning
2011-12-17T23:28:46  <ChrisH_> Antimony: i've got the replay up, can you show me a specific hill and turn # where this happens?
2011-12-17T23:29:16  <Antimony> do you have a link handy?
2011-12-17T23:29:24  <ChrisH_> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.35482
2011-12-17T23:30:06  <Antimony> The first time is turns 8-10
2011-12-17T23:30:56  <ChrisH_> The feature isn't enabled yet on turn 8.
2011-12-17T23:31:42  <ChrisH_> Turn 15 is the first time an ant steps off a hill after the feature is on.
2011-12-17T23:32:17  <ChrisH_> In that case it is because the ant in question is going for some food, which will replace itself on hill, so that is ok.
2011-12-17T23:32:46  <Antimony> oh, I thought you turned on the feature at turn 8. I guess that was coincidence
2011-12-17T23:32:54  <Antimony> anyway it happens later too
2011-12-17T23:33:00  <ChrisH_> On turn 33 an ant steps off without food in the hive because it is particpating in a combat.

2011-12-17T23:33:20  <ChrisH_> I think so
2011-12-17T23:34:03  <ChrisH_> I did discover a bug in my food collection tracking during development of this feature that I had to fix to get it working right in some cases.

2011-12-17T23:35:06  <ChrisH_> The bug was that if one of my ants moved next to a food (so I eat it), but a new food spawns in the same place on that same turn by bot used to think it had not eaten the first food, but then a new ant would spawn unexpectedly and I would think I had -1 food in the hive.
2011-12-17T23:35:38  <ChrisH_> But that's fixed now, so I'm pretty sure it's working as intended.
2011-12-17T23:35:50  <ChrisH_> Antimony: thanks for checking up on me though.  :)

2011-12-17T23:36:31  <_flag> ChrisH_: yes
2011-12-17T23:37:19  <ChrisH_> ok, we just had a couple games, the first I timed out (not sure why that happens on the TCP servers, but the second is a legit game.  you won both
2011-12-17T23:37:39  <Antimony> It happens again on turn 66
2011-12-17T23:38:08  <_flag> ChrisH_: Yeah, I saw both, you had me the first one :)
2011-12-17T23:38:24  <ChrisH_> I'm just starting to watch them.
2011-12-17T23:39:23  <ChrisH_> The second one had you me and BenJackson all in a row on a translational symetry, tough section of the board for BJ.
2011-12-17T23:39:46  <Antimony> ug, I've got a nasty bug in my bot that I can't figure out
2011-12-17T23:40:19  <_flag> Yeah, one of the tough things about multiplayer games is that not all positions are created equal
2011-12-17T23:41:35  <ChrisH_> especially on the tcp servers where the matches involve a wider range of bot skill
2011-12-17T23:42:21  <Antimony> apparently, my bot thinks enemy ants are jesus
2011-12-17T23:42:31  <Antimony> It expects them to walk on water
2011-12-17T23:44:10  <ChrisH_> _flag: the game where I timed out was a really good test of my newest code feature, and it requires a top bot to test against, so thanks for that
2011-12-17T23:45:15  <_flag> ChrisH_: Is it pushing through battle disadvantages when at a positional advantage? I had a tricky time getting something like that to work
2011-12-17T23:45:18  <Antimony> wow, what a stupid bug. I had an incorrect else if for enemy movement
2011-12-17T23:46:08  <ChrisH_> _flag: I wouldn't describe it like that, but that can be the behavior.
