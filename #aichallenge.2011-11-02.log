2011-11-02T00:04:10  <McLeopold> ccc_: you have some invalid moves, but that's not it.
2011-11-02T00:04:39  <McLeopold> ccc_: can you do a catch all to exceptions and print a stack trace or something?

2011-11-02T00:05:34  <ccc_> hmm, my bot is just a simple C program, so i don't know if i can catch exceptions, also in my local it never crashes
2011-11-02T00:05:40  <capa> not so much
2011-11-02T00:07:37  <McLeopold> ccc_: maybe you can setup a vm running ubuntu and try and make it crash

2011-11-02T00:08:36  <capa> McLeopold: i only know how to use stdout
2011-11-02T00:08:47  <capa> dont know stderr
2011-11-02T00:09:13  <McLeopold> it's almost the same for console apps, it goes to the screen
2011-11-02T00:09:16  <janzert> McLeopold: from the results I'm seeing I don't see how the seq count for opponent list used for the pareto cutoff can actually be counting in order of descending match quality.
2011-11-02T00:09:43  <McLeopold> janzert: can you just pretend that it does :)
2011-11-02T00:10:06  <janzert> it's my current theory on what is messing up pairings :P
2011-11-02T00:10:15  <McLeopold> capa: fprintf(stderr, "blah"); will be ignored, but we will capture the output and show you if you crash
2011-11-02T00:10:26  <McLeopold> janzert: how are pairings messed up?
2011-11-02T00:10:41  <janzert> e.g. a group size of 11 with the closest player ranked over 150 ranks away can't be right
2011-11-02T00:11:01  <janzert> they are pulling from too broad of rankings too consitently
2011-11-02T00:11:06  <janzert> consistently
2011-11-02T00:11:10  <a1k0n> my last match was #4, me, #4086, #935, #6
2011-11-02T00:11:15  <capa> void move(int index, char dir, struct game_state* Game, struct game_info* Info) {     //fprintf(stdout, "O %i %i %c\n", Game->my_ants[index].row, Game->my_ants[index].col, dir); 	fprintf(stderr, "blah");
2011-11-02T00:11:22  <McLeopold> capa: so, just sprinkle some fprintf(stderr, ""); stuff and various points in your code, and if it crashes, all the prints below that point won't get printed, thus telling you where it possibly crashed
2011-11-02T00:11:56  <McLeopold> janzert: for multiple opponents, a new pareto number is chosen for each one
2011-11-02T00:12:13  <McLeopold> so the likelyhood of a tight range goes down
2011-11-02T00:12:31  <McLeopold> I could do the pareto once, and use it for all opponents
2011-11-02T00:12:32  <janzert> yes, the group I was talking about was the selection for one opponent (the first opponent)
2011-11-02T00:12:39  <McLeopold> ok

2011-11-02T00:12:58  <McLeopold> there are nested queries doing the work

2011-11-02T00:13:18  <janzert> yeah, I know and reading the code seems like it should work :P
2011-11-02T00:13:27  <janzert> it's just not what I'm seeing happen though
2011-11-02T00:13:31  <McLeopold> the next layer increments the seq by one and attaches it to the results
2011-11-02T00:13:32  <paulwal> capa, as McLeopold said, printf("hello")  is the same as fprintf(stdout, "hello") .... use stdout for moving ants, use stderr to output anything you want to your profile for debugging stuff

2011-11-02T00:17:36  <janzert> ccc_: if you allocate over 1.5GB it will
2011-11-02T00:18:14  <janzert> paulwal: :) no
2011-11-02T00:18:18  <paulwal> heh
2011-11-02T00:18:39  <janzert> besides if you just logged in and did that it wouldn't help you any anyway
2011-11-02T00:18:49  <janzert> since it wouldn't effect the sandbox at all ;)
2011-11-02T00:18:59  <McLeopold> janzert: match quality looks like it counts down, and the result count is correct according to the random pareto number...
2011-11-02T00:19:09  <McLeopold> so, the only problem could be missing entries
2011-11-02T00:19:22  <paulwal> it wouldn't?
2011-11-02T00:19:23  <ccc_> janzert: no I'm not allocating that much anyway, also one of the game crashed at just step 1, I took the "Bot In" results from the replay and fed it to my program, my bot worked fine
2011-11-02T00:19:26  <Antimony> what does that command even do? All I can tell is that it creates a symbolic link to tclsh
2011-11-02T00:19:50  <janzert> yes, I just can't believe that there isn't a higher match quality within the closer 200+ ranks
2011-11-02T00:20:06  <janzert> McLeopold: I can manually look for a few if you want
2011-11-02T00:20:07  <McLeopold> the ranks that are outside the norm have high sigma
2011-11-02T00:20:52  <McLeopold> janzert: I can create a query that gives the full match quality for the closest in rank
2011-11-02T00:20:54  <janzert> McLeopold: I would expect all of them to be close to 220 they are all 306 or less
2011-11-02T00:20:59  <paulwal> Antimony, /usr/bin/tclsh is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/tclsh8.4. This would overwrite tclsh to point to /usr/bin/tclsh8.5.  The compiler.py executes tclsh
2011-11-02T00:21:10  <capa> paulwal: thanks, i think it shows me where it crashed
2011-11-02T00:21:26  <janzert> none higher is also a little suspicious
2011-11-02T00:21:31  <janzert> higher than 220 that is
2011-11-02T00:21:41  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-11-02T00:21:46  <paulwal> Antimoney, the long term fix is to have compiler.py execute /usr/bin/tclsh8.5 instead of tclsh
2011-11-02T00:21:51  <McLeopold> I would expect it to be different as well
2011-11-02T00:21:53  <paulwal> Antimony*
2011-11-02T00:22:10  <McLeopold> maybe the exp(sum(ln())) on a single result is causing rounding errors?
2011-11-02T00:22:19  <McLeopold> no...
2011-11-02T00:22:25  <Antimony> so you're basically asking them to update the version of tclsh they use?
2011-11-02T00:22:32  <McLeopold> second sig fig varies too much
2011-11-02T00:22:49  <capa> McLeopold: Can i use "malloc" ?
2011-11-02T00:22:57  <janzert> yeah, did you see my query asking why you don't just do a real geometric mean?
2011-11-02T00:22:57  <McLeopold> sure
2011-11-02T00:23:07  <McLeopold> no, I missed that
2011-11-02T00:23:39  <janzert> dividing the sum result by (@player_count + 1) before get the exp of it would be a real geometric mean
2011-11-02T00:23:48  <janzert> just wondering if there was a reason you didn't?
2011-11-02T00:23:54  <McLeopold> nope
2011-11-02T00:23:56  <janzert> it doesn't make a difference in ordering of course
2011-11-02T00:24:07  <janzert> just more intuitive to look at I suppose
2011-11-02T00:24:16  <paulwal> Antimony, yes.  tclsh8.5 is already installed.  The package is installed in new servers by setup/worker_setup.py.  But worker/compiler.py executes tclsh, which by default is a symlink to /usr/bin/tclsh8.4 instead of /usr/bin/tclsh8.5
2011-11-02T00:24:48  <a1k0n> wow, trueskill is implemented as a stored procedure
2011-11-02T00:25:04  <McLeopold> a1k0n: match quality only, just an approximation
2011-11-02T00:25:06  <janzert> a1k0n: just the pairing not rank updating
2011-11-02T00:25:18  <a1k0n> ah i see
2011-11-02T00:26:39  <ChrisH_> janzert: another crash for skill points: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=389
2011-11-02T00:27:01  <janzert> yeah, I saw it already. the mu is consitently going down of course
2011-11-02T00:27:02  <paulwal> Antimony, so I'm thinking the `ln` command above would be an immediate fix (because i'm being impatient), but janzert has informed me that the sandbox would not see this change.
2011-11-02T00:27:08  <janzert> just sigma is moving faster still
2011-11-02T00:27:52  <a1k0n> paulwal: i'm guessing you can't just put #!/usr/bin/tclsh8.4 at the top?
2011-11-02T00:28:17  <a1k0n> er, 8.5
2011-11-02T00:28:35  <capa> McLeopold: I did what you said, and i think it shows me where it crashed. but i still dont know what is happening ..
2011-11-02T00:28:43  <janzert> a1k0n: no the worker is explicitly running it with tclsh
2011-11-02T00:28:59  <paulwal> a1k0n, i don't think it would work
2011-11-02T00:29:59  <a1k0n> tclsh would have to be aware of the various versions, etc, like perl
2011-11-02T00:31:01  * janzert plans on starting the worker update in about 15 minutes
2011-11-02T00:31:17  * paulwal thanks janzert kindly :)

2011-11-02T00:31:26  <a1k0n> besides sampling from a pareto distribution, isn't there value in ensuring a "bracketing" for the selected player?
2011-11-02T00:32:03  <paulwal> a1k0n, i'm pretty certain tclsh just ignores the hashbang as a comment
2011-11-02T00:32:13  <janzert> a1k0n: match_quality should be taking care of it
2011-11-02T00:32:22  <a1k0n> e.g. i just got paired up with two players ranked well below me, and i won, which reduces my sigma but doesn't add much information
2011-11-02T00:32:38  <janzert> yeah, something seems broken atm
2011-11-02T00:33:33  <McLeopold> janzert: http://pastebin.com/ekjHMH5x
2011-11-02T00:34:19  <McLeopold> a1k0n: if you get a large pareto number, it will favor a round-robin approach with the nearer bots first
2011-11-02T00:34:53  <McLeopold> so if the random number was very large (1000), all 999 bots would have to have played a game before 1000 is actually picked

2011-11-02T00:37:35  <janzert> well, they should be
2011-11-02T00:38:28  <a1k0n> is beta 1/sigma?
2011-11-02T00:38:50  <a1k0n> in your terminology there
2011-11-02T00:38:56  <janzert> beta = initial mu / 6

2011-11-02T00:39:04  <janzert> where initial mu = 50
2011-11-02T00:39:09  <a1k0n> well yes, i see that
2011-11-02T00:39:11  <a1k0n> but what does beta mean
2011-11-02T00:39:24  <McLeopold> janzert: the exp(sum(ln())) does not change the results for a single opponent
2011-11-02T00:39:43  <janzert> it's basically a measure of the variance in game results if I recall correctly
2011-11-02T00:40:01  <a1k0n> oh.  so it's from the canonical trueskill equations
2011-11-02T00:40:05  <a1k0n> lemme pull that up
2011-11-02T00:40:07  <janzert> McLeopold: right I realized that after a second or two ;)
2011-11-02T00:40:16  <ChrisH_> janzert, McLeopold I'm not that familiar with how TrueSkill works under the covers (I was just skimming the MS site for it), and maybe this is totally irrelevant, but could the funny matches be caused by the system trying to keep the game rate even and thus eliminating a lot of bots from contention because they have played too many other games recently?
2011-11-02T00:40:16  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, gtg

2011-11-02T00:43:43  <janzert> anyway I'll try and dig into it myself
2011-11-02T00:45:08  <a1k0n> ah, beta is the variance of performance.  which should be pretty low (if not 0) for a bot
2011-11-02T00:46:17  <a1k0n> heh but all kinds of math breaks down at 0.  makes sense.
2011-11-02T00:46:56  <janzert> a1k0n: I believe it's the variance of performance as in how likely a truly lower ranked player is to beat a higher ranked player not variance for one player between different games
2011-11-02T00:47:12  <janzert> but then I haven't looked at that in quite a while so I may be remembering wrong
2011-11-02T00:47:20  <a1k0n> well, it works out the same
2011-11-02T00:47:25  <janzert> not quite
2011-11-02T00:47:42  <janzert> beta for ants is probably still fairly high even with completely static players

2011-11-02T01:07:08  <treeform> is there other servers for testing?
2011-11-02T01:07:15  <ChrisH_> treeform: is the number in the "Next Game: #### players are ahead." part going down?
2011-11-02T01:07:25  <a1k0n> treeform: http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto
2011-11-02T01:07:42  <treeform> yes it is
2011-11-02T01:07:50  <ChrisH_> then you are getting closer to another game
2011-11-02T01:08:11  <ChrisH_> but you shouldn't expect more than a handful of games per day on the main server at the moment
2011-11-02T01:08:25  <treeform> will that improve?
2011-11-02T01:08:32  <ChrisH_> unknown
2011-11-02T01:08:40  <treeform> or is that how it will be till the challenge ends in december?
2011-11-02T01:09:03  <ChrisH_> I don't know, so much could change between now and then

2011-11-02T01:10:17  <treeform> ok
2011-11-02T01:11:06  <a1k0n> treeform: you make them up; accounts are implicitly created the first time
2011-11-02T01:11:14  <ChrisH_> treeform: but I can tell you that when the final competition is run they will likely prune the bottom of the standing away after some amount of time to dedicate more horsepower to getting the top ranks as accurate as possible, at least that's what they did in the last competition
2011-11-02T01:11:17  <a1k0n> it just prevents impersonation once you've established a ranking

2011-11-02T02:03:52  <burny> the top bots still have a LONG ways to go
2011-11-02T02:04:07  <ChrisH_> I think you're right burny
2011-11-02T02:04:31  <a1k0n> i hope so, otherwise this contest ended before it began
2011-11-02T02:04:40  <a1k0n> thanks to the long-ass beta phase
2011-11-02T02:04:53  <_flag> The other thing too is that it takes a really long time for ranks to stabilize on the main server
2011-11-02T02:05:03  <a1k0n> no kidding
2011-11-02T02:05:11  <_flag> So if you submitted your bot early, you probably won't drop out of the top 100 for the rest of the contest
2011-11-02T02:05:25  <burny> lol
2011-11-02T02:05:33  <_flag> Especially with how volatile ants games can be
2011-11-02T02:05:46  <burny> that better be fixed then..
2011-11-02T02:05:47  <_flag> To make things worse, nobody plays on tcp for long
2011-11-02T02:05:53  <_flag> So the player pool is really shallow
2011-11-02T02:05:56  <burny> cause if I start making my bot in a couple weeks..
2011-11-02T02:06:00  <burny> and submit a week later
2011-11-02T02:06:11  <burny> and can't ever get a single game to test my bot on..
2011-11-02T02:06:13  <burny> I'll be mad

2011-11-02T03:21:19  <Overburn> thestinger how did you implement your queue?
2011-11-02T03:21:22  <Overburn> one for every ant
2011-11-02T03:21:23  <grom358> yeah.. my explorers completly avoid atm.. which means they could get a piece of food if they didn't run
2011-11-02T03:21:38  <grom358> i need to make it trade ant for ant
2011-11-02T03:21:45  <Overburn> or one for everything
2011-11-02T03:21:52  <pairofdice> AHHH! Finally I got it working. I spent like 9 hours on this simplest thing
2011-11-02T03:22:19  <thestinger> Overburn: it's really hackish atm lol, I have a separate queue/movement cycle for each set of goals
2011-11-02T03:23:03  <thestinger> I put an ant onto the queue with 1) the ant's location and 2) each direction that will bring it closer to a target
2011-11-02T03:23:06  <grom358> hey my bot made it into the top 200 without combat
2011-11-02T03:23:21  <thestinger> yeah, I've made it into the top 100 three times now w/o combat :P

2011-11-02T03:23:57  <thestinger> I think ChrisH actually made it to the top 10 without combat, iirc he was just avoiding enemy ants at first
2011-11-02T03:24:05  <grom358> seems my attack hill at all costs works a lot of the time
2011-11-02T03:24:07  <thestinger> I'm sure he has combat now tho
2011-11-02T03:24:52  <Venom> I made one that did the top 400 without even considering any data about enemies (except for hills).
2011-11-02T03:25:16  <thestinger> yeah, my current code on the site doesn't deal with enemies at all
2011-11-02T03:25:29  <thestinger> locally I have the "combat" stuff started
2011-11-02T03:25:58  <grom358> how can u do top 10 without combat.. cause u have to raze.. which means combat
2011-11-02T03:26:07  <thestinger> well, I'm not including that as combat
2011-11-02T03:26:27  <a1k0n> yeah, i'm #40 and climbing and i just ignore enemy ants, and send everything after known enemy hills to raze them
2011-11-02T03:26:36  <treeform> any one using nodejs and having problems with flushing?
2011-11-02T03:26:39  <grom358> a1k0n: that is what i do
2011-11-02T03:26:49  <Venom> grom: yes, it does if your "swarming" is good.  sometimes it's just emerge and you don't even need swarming code
2011-11-02T03:26:56  <thestinger> yeah I explore when I don't know where an enemy hill is, then rush it
2011-11-02T03:27:10  <a1k0n> yeah i've had entire armies wiped out by two ants stationed on either side of the enemy hill
2011-11-02T03:27:15  <thestinger> I worked on avoiding forming straight lines a bit, so they aren't completely helpless
2011-11-02T03:27:36  <Venom> a1kon: haha. happenned to me too.
2011-11-02T03:27:44  <grom358> yeah that happens to me
2011-11-02T03:27:48  <thestinger> I don't have proper foraging atm because I don't re-explore locations - I just haven't gotten around to finishing up that code
2011-11-02T03:27:55  <grom358> 2 ants take out 30 - 50 of mine
2011-11-02T03:28:11  <Venom> thestinger is in the top10?
2011-11-02T03:29:06  <thestinger> no
2011-11-02T03:29:07  <thestinger> ChrisH
2011-11-02T03:29:18  <Venom> ah, okay
2011-11-02T03:29:26  <thestinger> anyway, I'm sure he has combat now

2011-11-02T03:30:54  <Venom> btw, if the AI limit is ultimately the processing time, how are some languages supposed to compete with some others *way* faster?

2011-11-02T04:42:11  <SharkMonkey> If food appears next to an ant, does it need to stay there for a turn to consume it?
2011-11-02T04:42:36  <antimatroid> yes
2011-11-02T04:42:36  <thestinger> yes, you can actually get blocked if you try to move onto a food
2011-11-02T04:44:16  <SharkMonkey> And dead when an ant behind you moves in because it assumed you were stepping out. :(
2011-11-02T04:44:51  <thestinger> just check for food when you step
2011-11-02T04:44:58  * SharkMonkey is way too tired to reason about his program anymore
2011-11-02T04:45:22  <pairofdice> Same
2011-11-02T04:45:47  <thestinger> for each food, I send the nearest ant (well, not exactly b/c I'm working on code to reuse ants), so if that ant is 1 square away from the food I tell it not to move that turn
2011-11-02T04:46:04  <thestinger> and I prevent ants from stepping on food just like water now, to avoid the same collision thing you just said

2011-11-02T05:21:32  <janzert> python dicts are a hash table so with a decent hash they should give you O(1) access
2011-11-02T05:21:39  <caution> yeah
2011-11-02T05:21:47  <caution> I've speed tested them, dict is only fractionally slower
2011-11-02T05:22:01  <janzert> of course the dict O(1) will still be larger than an array O(1) :)
2011-11-02T05:22:15  <caution> thestinger: why not use array.array?
2011-11-02T05:23:21  <thestinger> I guess that would be even better :P
2011-11-02T05:23:29  <thestinger> or use numpy arrays
2011-11-02T05:24:51  <caution> feels like you might as well use C++ if you have to optimise python so hard
2011-11-02T05:25:04  <thestinger> yeah, that's what I decided xD

2011-11-02T05:29:04  <thestinger> yeah, you can use C++11 now
2011-11-02T05:29:16  <thestinger> so you get unordered_set and unordered_map :)
2011-11-02T05:30:00  <thestinger> python will probably actually be harder to use if you already know C or C++ since it's so much slower
2011-11-02T05:34:28  <thestinger> caution: I guess array.array will have the same time complexity as a list, it's just an array of values instead of pointers to values
2011-11-02T05:34:38  <thestinger> numpy arrays can be allocated really fast
2011-11-02T05:37:26  <caution> wow pypy gives my bot a massive speed boost
2011-11-02T05:38:07  <caution> add pypy support please
2011-11-02T05:38:18  <thestinger> it's ~5x faster than cpython now I think
2011-11-02T05:38:38  <caution> makes my stale tile function run 4x faster
2011-11-02T05:39:10  <caution> contestbot, pypy?
2011-11-02T05:39:11  <contestbot> caution: Run as fast as you can and don't look back.
2011-11-02T05:39:54  <thestinger> caution: are you calling the function a lot?

2011-11-02T05:43:04  <bobbydroptable> yeh gonna get rid of that one... takes forever
2011-11-02T05:43:13  <bobbydroptable> at least that means , my bot's explore routine isn't that long!
2011-11-02T05:43:22  <thestinger> make your bot play games against itself :P
2011-11-02T05:43:29  <ikaros> test against your own bots.. old versions to see if they improved
2011-11-02T05:43:41  <bobbydroptable> it goes around in circles still though =="
2011-11-02T05:48:06  <bobbydroptable> hypothetically speaking, if i had a datastructure that mapped paths between every single walkable tile on a map, how big would that be
2011-11-02T05:48:13  <bobbydroptable> ^^
2011-11-02T05:50:09  <caution> at least I can run the sample bots with pypy to speed up testing
2011-11-02T05:50:13  <ikaros> if you'd make a bfs for every tile covering the whole map and the map would be 200*200(max) then it would be 200^4 :)
2011-11-02T05:50:17  <Zao> bobbydroptable: Well, how many distinct pairs of tiles are there?
2011-11-02T05:50:43  <bobbydroptable> lets say worst case scenario, a 150x150 map with no water tiles?
2011-11-02T05:50:54  <ikaros> 200 is worst case :)
2011-11-02T05:50:59  <bobbydroptable> lol okay 200x200
2011-11-02T05:51:01  <Zao> That's pretty much (150*150)^2/2, or so.
2011-11-02T05:51:14  <Zao> Give or take some horrible math, but it's quadratic in size.
2011-11-02T05:51:23  <bobbydroptable> but each tile has a full path to every other tile
2011-11-02T05:51:37  <thestinger> no, you make a distance map for each tile
2011-11-02T05:51:41  <thestinger> so that's a 2d array of ints
2011-11-02T05:51:45  <ikaros> yep
2011-11-02T05:51:55  <ikaros> and it's to large :)
2011-11-02T05:51:56  <bobbydroptable> how would a distance map help
2011-11-02T05:51:59  <ikaros> with a max of 200
2011-11-02T05:52:10  <ikaros> it stores every path to a single target
2011-11-02T05:52:41  <bobbydroptable> every path or every distance?
2011-11-02T05:52:48  <bobbydroptable> o.O?
2011-11-02T05:53:01  <thestinger> 6400MB if sizeof (int) is 4 and that's what you're using
2011-11-02T05:53:08  <thestinger> well, you have every distance and thus every path
2011-11-02T05:53:23  <ikaros> hehe.. a sequence of minimal distances is a path :)

2011-11-02T05:53:40  <janzert> I think bobbydroptable is getting at you can store every path with 2 bits per tile
2011-11-02T05:53:57  <janzert> you just have to know which direction to step next
2011-11-02T05:54:04  <ikaros> lol
2011-11-02T05:54:15  <bobbydroptable> something like that
2011-11-02T05:54:20  <ikaros> lots of fun implementing that with a lot of masks
2011-11-02T05:54:27  <bobbydroptable> i'm probably thinking something really really memory inefficient
2011-11-02T05:54:30  <ikaros> and it probably wouldnt be fast =)
2011-11-02T05:54:53  <bobbydroptable> i was thinking path[origin][destination] = ['n','n','n','e','e','e','n','n']
2011-11-02T05:54:57  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-11-02T05:55:28  <bobbydroptable> which sounds even worse than any of the other suggestions
2011-11-02T05:55:28  <janzert> there was a decent post in a pathfinding thread in the forums explaining a decent memory compact way that you could fit all paths precomputed
2011-11-02T05:55:38  <ikaros> its the same as the distance map in this case its even larger because you repeat information
2011-11-02T05:55:42  <ikaros> well gotta run to the bus
2011-11-02T05:55:44  <ikaros> later :)
2011-11-02T05:55:48  <bobbydroptable> lol ok

2011-11-02T05:56:37  <janzert> not sure anyone is actually doing it though, just someone laid out a method that could possibly work :)
2011-11-02T05:56:50  <thestinger> it seems like you would fall really far behind just recomputing what you need
2011-11-02T05:57:33  <bobbydroptable> if you could implement a way to do it in your spare cycles it might be worth while?

2011-11-02T05:58:11  <thestinger> the top bots are probably usually all their spare cycles on minimax already

2011-11-02T06:08:46  <userjjb> So I have no language specific experience with any of the usable languages, guessing C++ is the way to go?
2011-11-02T06:09:11  <Venom> yes, but the ending score is 3 for me, 0 for him and I should have won, but I didn't
2011-11-02T06:09:15  <Zao> userjjb: C++ and C is an excellent route to hair loss.
2011-11-02T06:09:21  <thestinger> userjjb: what do you mean the "usable" languages?
2011-11-02T06:09:46  <userjjb> thestinger: the ones that have starter packages
2011-11-02T06:09:53  <thestinger> oh
2011-11-02T06:10:06  <Venom> Minthos *
2011-11-02T06:10:19  <thestinger> well, you really don't want to start learning C or C++ from scratch for this imo
2011-11-02T06:10:23  <userjjb> I've only programmed in MATLAB, Euphoria, and TI BASIC
2011-11-02T06:11:07  <thestinger> any of the compiled or jvm languages will be more than fast enough - python/ruby are very nice and easy to learn but the performance is hard to deal with
2011-11-02T06:11:39  <Minthos> Venom: I don't know which of them you are, but blue clearly won as he should
2011-11-02T06:12:12  <userjjb> Well I've been meaning to learn C++ so I figured this might be a good impetus to do so
2011-11-02T06:12:12  <Venom> Minthos: I'm the blue and yea, I got screwed on that one :P
2011-11-02T06:12:27  <Minthos> Venom: no you didn't, you won, what are you complaining about?
2011-11-02T06:12:31  <thestinger> userjjb: well, if you've been planning on learning it go ahead :)
2011-11-02T06:12:34  <userjjb> Is there anything about the task that inherently makes it challenging?
2011-11-02T06:12:45  <userjjb> in C++ specifically
2011-11-02T06:13:03  <Venom> Minthos: I didn't won. I'm classed #2.
2011-11-02T06:13:12  <thestinger> no, C++ has all the data structures and stuff you could ever want, it's just incredibly verbose/unreadable and it's a huge language so it's hard to learn
2011-11-02T06:13:27  <thestinger> using C would be very, very hard :P
2011-11-02T06:13:50  <Minthos> Venom: it clearly says 1 for me
2011-11-02T06:14:03  <Minthos> Venom: I think your browser is lying to you
2011-11-02T06:14:42  <Venom> not sure what's going on. I'm confused...  nvm
2011-11-02T06:15:19  <userjjb> I noticed under "environment" for C++ in starter packages it has gcc, will I run into issues using Visual Studio?
2011-11-02T06:15:37  <Minthos> userjjb: is you have no reason to specifically learn C++, stay far away from that evil language
2011-11-02T06:15:47  <thestinger> you can use gcc on windows
2011-11-02T06:16:00  <Minthos> *if
2011-11-02T06:16:56  <userjjb> well I already have Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate, so I have all sorts of goodies at my disposal, if I knew how to use them
2011-11-02T06:17:15  <Minthos> userjjb: learn C# instead
2011-11-02T06:17:39  <userjjb> Minthos: why?
2011-11-02T06:17:44  <Minthos> it's a much better language, even I the die-hard linux fan, admits that
2011-11-02T06:17:54  <thestinger> yeah, learn C# or Scala

2011-11-02T06:56:06  <caution> you could learn by automatically processing the replays from the website instead
2011-11-02T06:56:17  <thestinger> use the tcp server for stuff like that
2011-11-02T06:56:21  <Fluxid> and you cannot store state between battles in any way
2011-11-02T06:57:02  <Zao> No network, no files, etc.

2011-11-02T07:03:11  <FastEddie_> well if you let the bot control only one ant at the time, and then call multiple instances of the bot for each ant that you own
2011-11-02T07:03:27  <FastEddie_> you could only share information in the game world for example by doing a bee like dance
2011-11-02T07:03:44  <FastEddie_> or maybe even allow ants to drop different scents on the map
2011-11-02T07:03:56  <bobbydroptable> ooh that would be a completey different dynamic yeh
2011-11-02T07:04:01  <Minthos> spawn a process when an ant spawns, kill a process when an ant dies, I like it
2011-11-02T07:04:01  <FastEddie_> right now all the ants know everything because there is one overarching bot that is in full control

2011-11-02T07:18:30  <Migi32> I'm not too sure about that. You could let it go to food, explore randomly and let it do relatively simple and uncoordinated battles.
2011-11-02T07:18:46  <Migi32> no time for cute bee dances when you're in the middle of combat ;)
2011-11-02T07:19:24  <Migi32> so all in all I think the resulting bots would be less interesting

2011-11-02T07:22:16  <marijnfs> my ants stop moving after several turn, which i guess means they ran out their time limit
2011-11-02T07:22:21  <Minthos> does it crash when you run it locally?
2011-11-02T07:22:24  <marijnfs> but there is no further feedback
2011-11-02T07:22:28  <marijnfs> no only on the site
2011-11-02T07:22:41  <marijnfs> and locally it seems to be fast enough
2011-11-02T07:22:44  <marijnfs> but my pc is quite fast
2011-11-02T07:22:56  <Minthos> my ai runs much slower on the server

2011-11-02T07:25:22  <balkemacho> marijnfs is it a crash or a timeout, do you know?
2011-11-02T07:25:40  <marijnfs> so i dont know, there is no feedback
2011-11-02T07:25:45  <marijnfs> or i can't find it\
2011-11-02T07:26:10  <FastEddie_> in the replay it should say crash or timeout in the bar above
2011-11-02T07:26:11  <marijnfs> i am guessing a timeout but i dont know how close i am to it
2011-11-02T07:26:15  <marijnfs> ok
2011-11-02T07:26:20  <marijnfs> lets see
2011-11-02T07:26:30  <FastEddie_> and you can test it locally by setting the turn limit much lower
2011-11-02T07:27:13  <marijnfs> ah ok it says timeout
2011-11-02T07:27:23  <marijnfs> but locally it seems fast enough
2011-11-02T07:27:47  <marijnfs> i guess i need to be more efficient
2011-11-02T07:28:00  <balkemacho> the server's turntime is 500, but by default in a lot of the test scripts its 1000.
2011-11-02T07:28:08  <balkemacho> so first I would make sure your turntime is 500
2011-11-02T07:28:31  <marijnfs> euhm .25 seconds right?
2011-11-02T07:28:35  <marijnfs> 500 what?
2011-11-02T07:28:45  <balkemacho> milliseconds - so 0.5 seconds
2011-11-02T07:29:33  <balkemacho> i recommend checking time remaining to make sure you have a buffer, say 10ms, before doing anything complex (like a path find).
2011-11-02T07:29:39  <balkemacho> If there's not enough time left, just skip it.
2011-11-02T07:30:42  <balkemacho> In practice, I found edge cases would randomly cause timeouts. Been better since I started actually working with the clock. :)
2011-11-02T07:30:44  <marijnfs> locally it doesnt even timeout with time limit=.01 seconds
2011-11-02T07:30:58  <marijnfs> using a clock is a good idea;)
2011-11-02T07:31:06  <thestinger> what map are you using locally?

2011-11-02T07:32:16  <marijnfs> i use the map that caused the timeout online
2011-11-02T07:33:12  <marijnfs> i also write to a file for debugging
2011-11-02T07:33:21  <marijnfs> i dont know how that is handled on the server
2011-11-02T07:34:40  <balkemacho> you are not allowed to write to files afaik :)
2011-11-02T07:34:51  <balkemacho> perhaps a stupid question, but are you catching uncaught exceptions?
2011-11-02T07:35:04  <balkemacho> if so a crash would likely produce a "timeout" as far as the server knows.
2011-11-02T07:36:46  <marijnfs> i use go

2011-11-02T07:39:09  <thestinger> it's way faster now that they added deactivation, before I would have to wait 1000 minutes for a game :\

2011-11-02T07:39:48  <marijnfs> maybe on the lower ranks they should start with small battles on small maps
2011-11-02T07:40:13  <marijnfs> and some standard tests to see if you can collect food in a small map
2011-11-02T07:41:45  <marijnfs> what is your current strategy
2011-11-02T07:42:02  <balkemacho> Three days is a long time to let a start package run and waste cycles. I think if your bot fails at say collecting food X games in a row it gets automatically de-activated.
2011-11-02T07:42:28  <balkemacho> *it should get automatically de-activated, etc.
2011-11-02T07:42:34  <balkemacho> But definitely glad to see them improving it.
2011-11-02T07:42:51  <caution> what are the memory constraints for a bot?
2011-11-02T07:43:03  <bobbydroptable> i've heard it to be 1Gb

2011-11-02T07:48:33  <balkemacho> Yeah it's really smart. The instant feedback/progress is encouraging. It just shouldn't be at the detriment to other players. Like, if a person uploads an untouched starter bot (based on a hash) no need to run tha thing often. :)
2011-11-02T07:49:00  <caution> detect the starter package and show a premade replay lol
2011-11-02T07:49:50  <caution> is it definitely the starter packages that make it so long between games?
2011-11-02T07:51:47  <bobbydroptable> well, the game- terminate conditions go some way towards shortening noobie games
2011-11-02T07:51:57  <bobbydroptable> like "food not being gathered"
2011-11-02T07:52:15  <Migi32> isn't the amount of games you play related to your rating?
2011-11-02T07:52:46  <balkemacho> I believe so. But first time uploads appear to have their own queue, so not entirely.
2011-11-02T07:54:27  <balkemacho> I guess the only thing that really frustrates me is the penalty when uploading a new version of a bot. That cycle of upload a new version, early skill rating leads to very few games ... finally play some real games, see things that need to be improved. Repeat.
2011-11-02T07:55:07  <thestinger> just use the tcp server for testing then

2011-11-02T07:58:09  <Migi32> that way you get one game per 5 minutes instead of 5 hours

2011-11-02T09:11:28  <conor_f> *debugging
2011-11-02T09:11:43  <liberforce> well, i attach it after calling playgame.py, but gdb can't print the backtrace nor list the source
2011-11-02T09:11:46  <amstan> liberforce: if you want to the attaching business, you have to change your timeout params so it doesn't timeout when gdb reaches a breakpoint
2011-11-02T09:12:33  <amstan> liberforce: that's the extent of the stuff i know. in most debugging i do, the process is started by gdb

2011-11-02T09:14:16  <amstan> liberforce: but that entails that gdb steals your stdin, and that won't work for playgame.py

2011-11-02T09:15:30  <liberforce> amstan: hum... if gdb steals your stdin, how do you debug with ?
2011-11-02T09:15:37  <conor_f> is a dictionary in PY the same as a hash/associative array in Perl/PHP?
2011-11-02T09:15:51  <thestinger> nice, I think I actually made a big improvement to my bot (strcat_next is destroying strcat now :D)
2011-11-02T09:15:56  <amstan> liberforce: most of the stuff i have doesn't care about stdin very much
2011-11-02T09:16:12  <liberforce> amstan: is the same problem of stdin stealling occurring when attaching gdb to the process ?
2011-11-02T09:16:32  <liberforce> amstan: but parsing the server input requires stdin...
2011-11-02T09:16:54  <amstan> by stdin i mean that gdb starts and it does it's thing, shows you a prompt and all that
2011-11-02T09:17:04  <amstan> you don't want playgame to deal with that
2011-11-02T09:17:15  <amstan> liberforce: as i said, what you're looking for is to attach gdb to the already running process(started by playgame)
2011-11-02T09:17:42  <amstan> that way gdb will have its own stdin/stdout(connected to your terminal), and your bot's stdin/stdout will go to playgame
2011-11-02T09:17:43  <liberforce> amstan: ok, so what I need to do is augment the timeout

2011-11-02T10:38:48  <ChrisH> @later tell janzert Commenting out the rate limitting code may produce better parings, but it seems to have a bias towards submissions with more total games played (which is not surprising because they provide more information), but those submissions aren't necessarily active, so that doesn't help the deactivation policy.

2011-11-02T10:44:33  <retybok> marijnfs: those functions are called closures, it's one of Go's main features (google it)

2011-11-02T10:46:46  <marijnfs> today i played with the heap datastructure
2011-11-02T10:46:51  <marijnfs> it took some playing around

2011-11-02T12:17:28  <Hexren> Information is given for ants that died during the collision or battle  resolution of the previous turn if it is in a square currently visible  by one of your live ants. These squares are merely for your information  if you wish to use them, they can otherwise be thought of as land and  moved into that turn.

2011-11-02T12:34:38  <ikaros> hm if that is wanted i wouldnt need to track my ants anymore from turn to turn
2011-11-02T12:34:39  <Overburn> wtf anyone got any idea why the launcher gives me failed to start?

2011-11-02T12:36:09  <a1k0n> what a terrible movie
2011-11-02T12:36:25  <ikaros> so if two own ants go to one tile and so both die are there 2 dead ants sent in the next turn or only 1
2011-11-02T12:36:56  <Overburn> the specific tile of the map will be d
2011-11-02T12:37:10  <ikaros> k
2011-11-02T12:37:40  <Overburn> so you won't know that 2 died unless you do checks

2011-11-02T12:38:21  <McLeopold> 2 dead ants are sent
2011-11-02T12:38:38  <Overburn> wait, i must have gotten the questions wrong
2011-11-02T12:38:44  <Overburn> what exactly does sent mean in this context?
2011-11-02T12:38:54  <ikaros> how i track my ants
2011-11-02T12:39:09  <McLeopold> some of the starter packs only use a matrix, so you can't stuff 2 values into a square, but 2 lines would have been sent
2011-11-02T12:39:21  <Overburn> hmm i get one line only
2011-11-02T12:39:26  <Overburn> as far as i remember
2011-11-02T12:39:27  <Overburn> lemme check
2011-11-02T12:40:44  <Overburn> ah no
2011-11-02T12:40:46  <Overburn> my bad
2011-11-02T12:40:53  <Overburn> i get one line for each ant that dies
2011-11-02T12:41:01  <Overburn> hmm why didn't i notice that before

2011-11-02T12:42:56  <cyphase> you shouldn't be sending two of your ants to the same place anyway :P

2011-11-02T13:30:23  <ikaros> and you program has to read data from stdin

2011-11-02T13:31:40  <ikaros> hm ok but yes you have to read from stdin and write to stdout
2011-11-02T13:31:55  <ikaros> say just use print or write or how it is called in pascal

2011-11-02T14:56:24  <Migi32> I think it can stay at the bottom, but if the bot is disabled, you could put up an additional, very visible warning at the top (maybe with a little x to close it though)

2011-11-02T14:57:14  <janzert> Migi32: I would simply like the "Next Game" to change to the warning

2011-11-02T14:57:44  <janzert> since the effect of deactivation is that you're removed from the queue that section is telling you about
2011-11-02T14:57:59  <ChrisH> janzert: there are forces in tension with the game pairing in that submissions with lots of game history will give good information to the rankings so they get picked for a lot of games, but that snowballs into them being even better, and newer submissions tend to languish
2011-11-02T14:58:14  <Migi32> janzert: that's also ok
2011-11-02T14:58:24  <janzert> ChrisH: right

2011-11-02T14:59:04  <xathis> janzert: but the queue is only visible if you're logged in, and if you're not interested in the remaining time and don't upload a bot there's no reason to be logged in
2011-11-02T14:59:16  <Migi32> janzert: can't find McLeopold's post though, I'll just read the sql file then
2011-11-02T14:59:18  <pairofdice> I wonder if a dictionary approach would give less headaches than a list of lists...

2011-11-02T15:00:07  <ChrisH> janzert: yes, another curious dynamic is based on the overall ratio of active vs. inactive submissions
2011-11-02T15:00:08  <conor_f> would someone mind recommending the best data type for this question?
2011-11-02T15:00:17  <conor_f> C++ btw

2011-11-02T15:00:42  <conor_f> I want it to be like an associative array except it can hold more then one value
2011-11-02T15:00:45  <conor_f> any ideas?
2011-11-02T15:01:39  <ChrisH> janzert: if all submissions were active or all were inactive then giving everyone equal games is fair, but when there is a mixture, it would seem more fair to give the active submissions more games in proportion to that ratio

2011-11-02T15:02:31  <janzert> McLeopold: pairing quality is much, much better after disabling the rate limiting but as you said isn't really helping deactivated bots get fewer games
2011-11-02T15:02:56  <ChrisH> janzert: but the system of using the seed to accomplish that isn't effective because more games are allocated by pulling bots into games than by seeding
2011-11-02T15:03:35  <ChrisH> just because a game has one seed, but ~4.5 other bots on average
2011-11-02T15:03:57  <janzert> ChrisH: yeah
2011-11-02T15:04:29  <janzert> if the 4.5 opponents were randomly or uniformly selected it would work out, but they're not
2011-11-02T15:05:24  <McLeopold> janzert: the matchups look better because there are fewer bots excluded?
2011-11-02T15:05:36  <janzert> basically yes
2011-11-02T15:06:01  <janzert> you're allowed to play with players of much better match quality
2011-11-02T15:06:15  <janzert> i.e. much closer in mu
2011-11-02T15:06:39  <janzert> actually much closer in mu, skill, and ranking in general :}
2011-11-02T15:07:08  <McLeopold> but then we give too many games to specific bots
2011-11-02T15:07:11  <ChrisH> of the bots NOT submitted in the last three days, what is the % of active bots?
2011-11-02T15:07:25  <janzert> I'm thinking maybe the limiting should just be a little less agressive
2011-11-02T15:07:41  <McLeopold> we could move to games in 48 hours
2011-11-02T15:08:03  <janzert> I don't know if <= average game count would be enough...
2011-11-02T15:08:25  <ChrisH> McLeopold: that would behave the same, just create bigger clumps in time of games for each bot
2011-11-02T15:08:29  <janzert> McLeopold: I think longer time would make it wors
2011-11-02T15:08:43  <janzert> well not help any at least
2011-11-02T15:09:19  <ChrisH> I was thinking that active bots should be limitted to the rate averate * (1 + activation ratio) or something like that
2011-11-02T15:09:31  <ChrisH> average + ...
2011-11-02T15:09:53  <ChrisH> and inactive bots limitted to just the average

2011-11-02T15:11:17  <ChrisH> is that backwards? wouldn't you want to cut off inactive bots?

2011-11-02T15:11:47  <ChrisH> that part I get
2011-11-02T15:12:16  <ChrisH> maybe we should take a different perspective.
2011-11-02T15:12:21  <McLeopold> match quality will skew the game counts if there are not limits, so we'd have to drop the match quality factor

2011-11-02T15:13:13  <janzert> McLeopold: it would be good if each game in the past 24 hours counted against the bot's match quality but not a strict cutoff?
2011-11-02T15:13:23  <ChrisH> I believe the currently active bot population is generally skewed to lower skill levels due to them being new submissions
2011-11-02T15:13:25  <janzert> then we could just balance how much it needed to count against it

2011-11-02T15:23:01  <ChrisH> McLeopold: sorry, I don't have a great solution yet, just trying to think through the requirements in a different way.
2011-11-02T15:23:18  <ChrisH> McLeopold: this is certainly a challenging problem
2011-11-02T15:23:22  <janzert> Migi32: they need to still play games so the rankings don't get too skewed, also just because they are deactivated doesn't mean the active bots wouldn't want to see games against them
2011-11-02T15:24:02  <Migi32> yeah, but every game an inactive bot plays means a game that an active bot doesn't play
2011-11-02T15:24:08  <janzert> How about for the moment I put the rate limiting back in at <= average games which should be about what we had but might be a bit better
2011-11-02T15:24:25  <McLeopold> rather than * 1.1?
2011-11-02T15:24:28  <ChrisH> Migi32: click through the bots on page 4 or 5 of the rankings and you would probably count <5% as active, so you need to use some inactive bots to fill in matches for the few that are active

2011-11-02T15:26:01  <janzert> it allows bots right at the average number of games
2011-11-02T15:26:08  <janzert> or whatever the cutoff is
2011-11-02T15:26:14  <McLeopold> the average is going to be a real number, the game count is an integer

2011-11-02T15:26:45  <ChrisH> I'm with McLeopold and thinking trying something like 1.1 or 1.2 is better
2011-11-02T15:26:46  <janzert> so * 1.1 is likely to make no difference right now then?
2011-11-02T15:26:49  <McLeopold> and the code was < avg * 1.1 + 1
2011-11-02T15:27:15  <McLeopold> it means that the bot with the most games should have at most 10% more than the bot with the least games

2011-11-02T15:44:27  <janzert> but removing more than about 15% from consideration seems like too much of the population
2011-11-02T15:44:38  <ikaros> c++ starterbot has a "players" input where it sets number of players.. this argument is never passed right?
2011-11-02T15:44:46  <McLeopold> janzert: sure, that might be better
2011-11-02T15:45:03  <McLeopold> I originally had the factor at 1.616 to do that
2011-11-02T15:45:11  <janzert> yeah, I think it's a better metric all around
2011-11-02T15:45:17  <McLeopold> but the game rates were still vary uneven
2011-11-02T15:45:50  <janzert> since the distribution may not be normal I'm afraid basing off average could be acting in unexpected ways
2011-11-02T15:46:06  <McLeopold> true
2011-11-02T15:47:31  <caution> will you add support for pypy please?
2011-11-02T15:47:40  <ChrisH> is there a sensible way to give a boost to match quality for active bots only so that they are more likely to be chosen, but we could still keep active bot game rates uniform?
2011-11-02T15:48:12  <ChrisH> and higher than inactive bots in general, that's what I think people would expect the system to do

2011-11-02T15:49:01  <McLeopold> ChrisH: that example wasn't convincing :)
2011-11-02T15:49:32  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I know it's not directly tranlsatable into code, let me try again.
2011-11-02T15:49:48  <McLeopold> I mean the link to the player page
2011-11-02T15:50:19  <McLeopold> look at the bots in the 400 rank range, their first games are always around rank 1000-2000, which is an area that is not starter bots
2011-11-02T15:50:42  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Oh, you think a bot that wins one game and then gets zero points and crashes in six straight games ought to keep going up in skill?
2011-11-02T15:50:44  <janzert> ChrisH: how much do we want to decrease match quality to try and increase active bot participation though? right now we don't really let it effect it at all beyond choosing the seed
2011-11-02T15:51:07  <janzert> ChrisH: the mu is going down and the bot only crashes after its last hill is taken
2011-11-02T15:51:08  <ChrisH> janzert: that's the hard part ;)
2011-11-02T15:51:25  <janzert> at least if it's the user we were looking at last night
2011-11-02T15:52:14  <McLeopold> ChrisH: are you refering to this :) http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=45560&user=389
2011-11-02T15:52:21  <ChrisH> yeah, but does it make sense to come in LAST PLACE six games in a row and go up in rank? No, it doesn't, and it's because it "tied" with other good bots, but that's an artifact of the scoring system
2011-11-02T15:52:59  <janzert> ChrisH: but it does, since the rank increase is only an artifact of the sigma decreasing
2011-11-02T15:53:00  <McLeopold> a tie is not last place
2011-11-02T15:53:06  <ChrisH> McLeopold: yes, that player, but look at how it keeps going up in subsequent games just by nature of the scheduling
2011-11-02T15:53:09  <McLeopold> it got a lucky pairing
2011-11-02T15:54:19  <janzert> McLeopold: hehe, just noticed showing the bot game errors to an admin is slightly broken. it gives my username instead of the player whose error is being shown
2011-11-02T15:54:36  <ChrisH> ok, so now extend that to when you have a large population of bots that all tie against each other (starter bots), their skill will behave similarly
2011-11-02T15:54:40  <McLeopold> ChrisH: yeah, after it tied you, it just kept losing mu
2011-11-02T15:54:53  <McLeopold> janzert: yep, oh well
2011-11-02T15:55:05  <janzert> I'll try and remember to fix it later
2011-11-02T15:55:34  <McLeopold> ChrisH: no, it won't, tieing against a bot that is not established is different
2011-11-02T15:55:40  <janzert> ChrisH: I don't see the correlation?
2011-11-02T15:57:09  <ChrisH> if you had 1000 starters play 10,000 matches and all get their sigma down, and then you introduce a single xathis, how long would it take those starters to lose mu?
2011-11-02T15:57:46  <ChrisH> now introduce a new starter, it will quickly rise in the rankings to equal the other starters because it would never play xathis.
2011-11-02T15:58:04  <janzert> it would probably play xathis the second game
2011-11-02T15:58:19  <janzert> assuming xathis was established of course

2011-11-02T15:59:00  <ChrisH> so , you would still have a big population of bots with >>0 mu, that's all I'm saying
2011-11-02T15:59:15  <ChrisH> it would take a large number of xathis bots to push down the starters
2011-11-02T15:59:44  <janzert> yes, and I don't think it would hurt anything. for all established bots the rank ordering would still be correct
2011-11-02T15:59:56  <janzert> absolute skill is completely arbitrary
2011-11-02T16:00:19  <ChrisH> so, let's stop going around in circles, this all started with McLeopold saying that it was hard to avoid scheduling the starter bots because their mu was too high, so I raised the point.
2011-11-02T16:00:33  <ChrisH> that they won't likely be going down any time soon

2011-11-02T16:01:03  <conor_f> this is hard...
2011-11-02T16:01:15  <ChrisH> and that was just to illustrate that you can't rely on the starter bot mu's going down to reduce the scheduling of inactive starter bots
2011-11-02T16:01:19  <conor_f> a lot harder then the tutorial is making it out to be
2011-11-02T16:01:30  <janzert> hmm, if they the large majority were not active I don't think they would be getting scheduled much and I though we already saw evidence of this
2011-11-02T16:01:32  <ChrisH> because I believe starter bots will always have mu >>0
2011-11-02T16:02:10  <ChrisH> janzert: yes but there is an even larger % of non-starters that are inactive, so it doesn't help in the end
2011-11-02T16:02:49  <ChrisH> and it goes back to my point yesterday that it only takes 1 active starter to keep pulling in 4.5 others into the pool

2011-11-02T16:04:45  <janzert> yes, if too many active accounts remain mingled in with all the inactive starter to ever allow sections to "go dormant" then we would probably need to get more aggressive
2011-11-02T16:05:16  <janzert> I'm not sure we're there yet as I don't think we're at a point that the overall pairing is working the way we want
2011-11-02T16:05:37  <ChrisH> janzert: ok, so let's look at the top several pages of the rankings, a high percentage have not reactivated their bots, so now the system is challenged to find good pairings for the active bots, and here we are trying to figure out how to make good pairnigs while simultaneously minimze pairing inactive bots and do it in a way that keeps game rates even, it's almost contradictory

2011-11-02T16:17:08  <McLeopold> ChrisH: yes, but I'm not trying to meet any expectations, other than a constant game rate for active bots and good pairings
2011-11-02T16:17:26  <McLeopold> I'm *not* trying to limit the game rates of inactive bots
2011-11-02T16:17:33  <ChrisH> McLeopold: LOL, ok
2011-11-02T16:17:39  <McLeopold> I'm thinking it will be a happy consequence
2011-11-02T16:18:06  <McLeopold> So far, since new submissions start around 1200, I'm going to be right :)
2011-11-02T16:18:57  <McLeopold> right now we are discussing if we want to sacrifice game rate for better pairings
2011-11-02T16:19:12  <hjax> please excuse me being very noobish, as i havent touched python since the last ai contest, but i still have no idea how to fix my problem
2011-11-02T16:19:33  <ChrisH> Fair enough. Did you see the analysis I did last night or earlier today that (before janzert removed the rate limit) the deactivation was probably only reclaiming a couple percentage points worth of games from inactive bots?
2011-11-02T16:19:52  <Migi32> but actually, does it matter that we have many starter bots playing each other? I mean, they take almost no CPU, and these matches take a few seconds at most
2011-11-02T16:19:58  <McLeopold> hjax: you are passing the wrong types of variables to functions, try adding logging to your bot and to the ants.py file

2011-11-02T16:27:34  <Migi32> janzert, it's impossible to install a handler for SIGSTOP. How is my bot supposed to know how much time it has left?
2011-11-02T16:27:58  <janzert> by using a timer and finishing before it gets stopped

2011-11-02T16:28:28  <janzert> if it hasn't finished its turn by the time it gets stopped it will have timed out

2011-11-02T16:31:32  <janzert> from the time it is started for its turn it gets a continuous chunk of time
2011-11-02T16:34:11  <ChrisH> janzert: Do you think it would make sense to change the game scoring to include some kind of tie breaker if bots have the same number of points from razing hills?  I suggest it because I think finer grained scoring would improve the rankings.
2011-11-02T16:34:19  <Migi32> ok. one last question then. Didn't we decide during the planetwars contest that it's better to let a bot keep its rating if it resubmits?
2011-11-02T16:34:28  <hjax> well for some reason i cannot write to file >.>, is that much changed in python 2.7.1?
2011-11-02T16:34:55  <Migi32> hjax, on the contest servers you're not allowed to write to any files anyway
2011-11-02T16:35:03  <janzert> I'd really, really rather keep the clear goal for the game

2011-11-02T16:39:40  <janzert> hjax: maybe create a separate simple script that you run directly to get the file writing/logging working correctly
2011-11-02T16:39:42  <ChrisH> janzert: I guess you are relying on playing more games to sort out the differences between bots.

2011-11-02T16:44:37  <Migi32> oh they do? I thought they didn't do that last time
2011-11-02T16:44:58  <janzert> there's been confusion about that, including by me, but yes they have
2011-11-02T16:45:12  <ChrisH> janzert: thought experiment: bot population is 1000 starters and 1 xathis, the ranking of the starter bots would be inversly proportional to the number of games they played against xathis, sound right?
2011-11-02T16:46:15  <ChrisH> janzert: and there could be second order affects as well, how many time your oppenents had played xathis, etc.
2011-11-02T16:46:18  <pairofdice> A major facepalm moment trying to figure out a problem, you really need to re-import the module

2011-11-02T17:03:17  <ChrisH> janzert: a possible method of smoothing out the game rates without sacrificing as much match quality would be to scale match quality by a small amount that is proportional to the time since last game. the aim would be to avoid a small number of "landmark" bots from playing a lot of games against new submissions.

2011-11-02T17:03:40  <dwins> hjax: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function, it's needed to use something as a key in a python dict (among other things)
2011-11-02T17:03:44  <Relax> hjax: Lists can not be used as keys in dictionaries is the upshot, you probably mean to use a tuple instead
2011-11-02T17:04:25  <pairofdice> mutables can't be keys
2011-11-02T17:04:34  <pairofdice> So yea, (), not []
2011-11-02T17:05:03  <hjax> i have no idea what either of you guys just said, i just know im passing the tuple with the coordinants of the target to the direction function, and it is popping out that error
2011-11-02T17:05:15  <ChrisH> janzert: a decision would be needed about the maximimum amount of match quality we're willing to give up, and that is what would get removed from a bot in the most recent game, while a bot that has played least recently would not have match quality reduced at all
2011-11-02T17:05:30  <janzert> right
2011-11-02T17:05:49  <pairofdice> hjax, direction wants two locations ((x,y), (x, y))

2011-11-02T17:07:36  <ChrisH> and you might not want the delta function to be linear, because once a bot is in the oldest half it really shouldn't be penalized, but a bot in the most recent 10% probably should.
2011-11-02T17:07:40  <pairofdice> you problem lies with bestfood
2011-11-02T17:08:01  <pairofdice> erm
2011-11-02T17:08:13  <hjax> pairofdice: i figured that out from the error messages, but how do i fix it?
2011-11-02T17:08:54  <hjax> best food is a tuple, so is ant_loc, i pass them into direction and it should give me a n, s, e, or w
2011-11-02T17:09:30  <hjax> but instead im getting this stupid error
2011-11-02T17:10:23  <ChrisH> janzert: so if the least recently played bots get a base coefficient of 0.0 and the most recently played bots get 1.0, I would probably start with squaring that coefficient and then multiply it by the maximum match quality delta allowed

2011-11-02T17:28:53  <magiik> i've had to break the updates up across turns

2011-11-02T17:30:26  <magiik> he has a match like every couple minutes lol

2011-11-02T17:31:11  <magiik> from the hills?

2011-11-02T17:31:41  <magiik> but even one BFS on a large map was taking me 300 ms or something

2011-11-02T19:09:13  <Antimony> tcp is useless if you want to test timeouts though
2011-11-02T19:09:24  <Antimony> you have to be much more conservative with time usage due to random network delays
2011-11-02T19:10:16  <conor_f> I just want to see it working :)

2011-11-02T19:12:11  <conor_f> lol
2011-11-02T19:12:19  <conor_f> why not try it on the TCP server? :P
2011-11-02T19:12:30  <Antimony> like I said, TCP is useless for testing timeouts
2011-11-02T19:12:35  <Antimony> which is what I'm trying to do
2011-11-02T19:12:54  <conor_f> ah, ok
2011-11-02T19:12:57  <Antimony> I want to see if the server also has random delays
2011-11-02T19:13:20  <conor_f> I don't really understand the timeouts. They're going to keep lowering the time allowed until your bot doesn't make the time?
2011-11-02T19:13:32  <Antimony> they're not supposed to
2011-11-02T19:13:44  <Antimony> they presumably lowered it to 500ms so they could simulate games faster

2011-11-02T20:16:32  <roflmao> man I've noticed that the really pro players
2011-11-02T20:16:39  <roflmao> they don't throw ants at hills
2011-11-02T20:16:44  <roflmao> they wait until the hill is unoccupied
2011-11-02T20:16:47  <roflmao> and then send in ants
2011-11-02T20:16:49  <roflmao> much less sacrifice
2011-11-02T20:17:11  <Rinum> roflmao: yup, I noticed that too
2011-11-02T20:17:19  <roflmao> or it's a proportion
2011-11-02T20:17:31  <roflmao> only attack if guaranteed success
2011-11-02T20:17:34  <roflmao> shouldn't be hard to implement
2011-11-02T20:17:59  <roflmao> e.g. I have 18 ants at X distance from hill
2011-11-02T20:18:06  <roflmao> while enemy has 22 bots at same X distance from hill
2011-11-02T20:18:09  <roflmao> = wait for attack
2011-11-02T20:18:24  <roflmao> until i have a ratio of, let's say, 130% ants near his hill
2011-11-02T20:18:37  <roflmao> trick is to keep them busy AROUND the hill without actually ATTACKING the hill
2011-11-02T20:18:41  <pairofdice> The battle mechanic is very simple
2011-11-02T20:19:00  <roflmao> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.17757
2011-11-02T20:19:09  <roflmao> turn 100, yellow, that's jsut disgusting, one ant took my hill
2011-11-02T20:19:10  <roflmao> need more protection
2011-11-02T20:19:30  <Rinum> I've noticed users setting "hill guards"
2011-11-02T20:19:42  <Rinum> they have 4 ants protecting 4 corners of the hill
2011-11-02T20:19:47  <roflmao> yeah
2011-11-02T20:19:51  <Rinum> that should prevent those 1 ant kills
2011-11-02T20:19:55  <roflmao> yes
2011-11-02T20:20:00  <pairofdice> All I have noticed how much python hates anything I want to do
2011-11-02T20:20:04  <pairofdice> +is
2011-11-02T20:20:04  <roflmao> trick is to coordinate the colllision
2011-11-02T20:20:09  <roflmao> ergo - if ant ant wants to get out
2011-11-02T20:20:15  <roflmao> you gotta fix it so ants can get out
2011-11-02T20:20:15  <roflmao> :p
2011-11-02T20:20:24  <roflmao> I think I'm going to do a more general radius type of thing
2011-11-02T20:20:38  <roflmao> maybe not 4 right next to the ant hill but around an X perimeter of the ant hill
2011-11-02T20:20:47  <roflmao> and those guards will chase any enemy ants that get nearby
2011-11-02T20:20:50  <roflmao> then go back to their position
2011-11-02T20:20:57  <Rinum> complex
2011-11-02T20:21:03  <roflmao> but obviously you don't want to do that very early game cause you need the ants to keep searching for food
2011-11-02T20:21:09  <roflmao> yea still thinking about it :)
2011-11-02T20:21:12  <Rinum> yup

2011-11-02T20:26:03  <icefox> pairofdice: a little surprised no one had mentioned it on the forum, but lots of talk about how to implement path finding quickly or caching so wrote up something
2011-11-02T20:27:03  <Rinum> icefox: do you have an example of it running?
2011-11-02T20:27:20  <icefox> Rinum: yah but I don't want to give away who I am :)
2011-11-02T20:27:40  <roflmao> okay I need a guard system
2011-11-02T20:27:51  <Rinum> icefox: nice :D
2011-11-02T20:29:16  <icefox> It behaves really well, especially on maze maps where it will always find the shortest path to everything
2011-11-02T20:29:36  <icefox> v.s. others that seem to fail on that
2011-11-02T20:30:03  <bobbydroptable> icefox: i've thought of something similar, but i had a couple of questions. the diffusion algorithm - basically a BFS from every food/hill/ant adding to a 2d array? also, do you have to do it every turn (from a clean slate) because of things disappearing (out of vision, picked up etc.)
2011-11-02T20:30:54  <icefox> bobbydroptable: depends, my current version some things I reset every turn, others I keep the diffused value around
2011-11-02T20:31:19  <bobbydroptable> so you have multiple 2d arrays (or maybe even a 3d array) for each group of objects you want to diffuse
2011-11-02T20:31:39  <bobbydroptable> what is the depth of your diffusion?
2011-11-02T20:31:41  <icefox> a simple logic version of that being if there *were* enemy ants == baddie ant hill nearby

2011-11-02T20:32:40  <bobbydroptable> mmm ok
2011-11-02T20:32:50  <icefox> bobbydroptable: you can do different depths of diffusion, but I mostly just did 2 passes, one forward and one backward
2011-11-02T20:33:18  <bobbydroptable> and that doesn't take up lots of CPU?
2011-11-02T20:33:32  <bobbydroptable> seems like something that would be extremely cpu intensive
2011-11-02T20:33:32  <icefox> not at all
2011-11-02T20:33:51  <icefox> I never have timeout issues
2011-11-02T20:33:55  <bobbydroptable> hmmmm
2011-11-02T20:33:56  <bobbydroptable> ok
2011-11-02T20:34:06  <icefox> remember this is a O(row * col) operation
2011-11-02T20:34:25  <pairofdice> Twice a turn?
2011-11-02T20:34:36  <icefox> yah, but I can easily do 1000
2011-11-02T20:34:54  <bobbydroptable> wouldn't this need to be done for every single food/ant/hill?
2011-11-02T20:34:56  <icefox> for a while after every ant move output I would re-diffuse
2011-11-02T20:35:02  <bobbydroptable> or am i missing something
2011-11-02T20:35:11  <bobbydroptable> (not sure what 2 passes mean)
2011-11-02T20:35:28  <icefox> you diffuse the map, not the objects
2011-11-02T20:35:34  <icefox> the whole anti-object thing
2011-11-02T20:35:43  <icefox> checkout the paper I linked to, it might explain it better
2011-11-02T20:36:02  <roflmao> I've devised a simple but extremely effective way of avoiding clustering

2011-11-02T20:36:52  <Rinum> btw... on fluxid.... when my bot times out, my terminal just hangs... shouldn't there be a message saying bot timed out and continue to a new game?
2011-11-02T20:38:17  <bobbydroptable> urgh too much math =="
2011-11-02T20:38:44  <icefox> hehe
2011-11-02T20:39:58  <icefox> bobbydroptable: skip the math and just skim through the paper, it is pretty readable
2011-11-02T20:42:12  <bobbydroptable> i get the concept

2011-11-02T20:56:37  <Antimony> I need to figure out a good way to make them spread out

2011-11-02T20:57:01  <Antimony> no, I want smart spreading out

2011-11-02T20:57:48  <icefox> the crude version I show is smart, it moves ants towards locations that haven't been seen before recently

2011-11-02T20:59:59  <a1k0n> i use a similar approach except i call it breadth-first-search to "diffuse"
2011-11-02T21:00:03  <Antimony> Here's mine http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=48944&user=3845
2011-11-02T21:00:10  <ccc_> i recently got to know here that in a same turn two adjacent ants can switch positions without collisions. what kind of datasturcture/logic are you guys using to do that intentionally, like the primitive method of storing ant locs in hashtable and checking if they are there won't work
2011-11-02T21:00:14  <a1k0n> and i use a sort of reinforcement learning type of framework for the math
2011-11-02T21:00:15  <Antimony> it automatically forms a 5x5 square around the hill for protection when there are enough ants
2011-11-02T21:00:26  <bobbydroptable> ccc_ why would you do that

2011-11-02T21:00:58  <icefox> a1k0n: does each ant have to do a separate breadth-first-search?
2011-11-02T21:01:06  <a1k0n> ccc_: just assume ants don't exist in the next turn until they've moved, and make "stay here" a move?
2011-11-02T21:01:10  <a1k0n> icefox: nope
2011-11-02T21:01:15  <icefox> ok good :)

2011-11-02T21:01:24  <bobbydroptable> in terms of state, XX would transition into XX (i.e., action is taken, and no change in state) which is a waste of a move.
2011-11-02T21:01:25  <roflmao> man my bot actually won some games on fluxid!!!
2011-11-02T21:01:27  <roflmao> so hyped
2011-11-02T21:01:41  <a1k0n> actually yes, i do local replanning
2011-11-02T21:01:41  <roflmao> all due to the enormous amount of help I received here on IRC
2011-11-02T21:01:50  <bobbydroptable> nice roflmao
2011-11-02T21:01:53  <ccc_> i want to interchange two neighboring ants, don't want to "stay here" actually, how to i do it
2011-11-02T21:02:08  <Antimony> the way I implemented collision avoidance causes lots of ants to switch places
2011-11-02T21:02:24  <ccc_> Antimony: yeah, whats the trick ;)
2011-11-02T21:02:31  <roflmao> anti: please share :) i have my own collision avoidance, we can compare
2011-11-02T21:02:37  <roflmao> icefox: that's the beauty of bfs
2011-11-02T21:02:41  <a1k0n> seriously though, why bother exchanging two ants?
2011-11-02T21:02:48  <Antimony> mine is basically a brute force graph search
2011-11-02T21:02:49  <a1k0n> ants themselves are interchangable
2011-11-02T21:03:07  <roflmao> icefox: one search to compute a global map.
2011-11-02T21:03:08  <ccc_> a1k0n: I've see lot of top players do that very frequently

2011-11-02T21:03:12  <bobbydroptable> ccc_ assuming you are tracking ants, just swap the ant locations
2011-11-02T21:03:21  <roflmao> icefox: you can use MULTIPLE targets in a bfs in a single search and it works
2011-11-02T21:03:24  <a1k0n> yeah probably one ant moves, the other is in its way, so it just exchanges to not die
2011-11-02T21:03:40  <a1k0n> a "peephole optimizer" could probably eliminate those
2011-11-02T21:03:44  <ccc_> bobbydroptable: its not so simple, my first ant checks to see if the position is empty which is not
2011-11-02T21:03:50  <Antimony> there's no reason to remove exchanges though
2011-11-02T21:03:53  <Antimony> they don't hurt anything
2011-11-02T21:04:20  <icefox> roflmao: yah that isn't a bad way of doing it
2011-11-02T21:04:24  <bobbydroptable> if you're tracking ants, and each ant has a specific goal, you could save 1 turn by just swapping their goals
2011-11-02T21:04:27  <bobbydroptable> instead of swapping ants
2011-11-02T21:04:32  <bobbydroptable> that's how I see it
2011-11-02T21:04:35  <roflmao> icefox: it's extremely fast and you always get the most optimal path
2011-11-02T21:04:35  <Antimony> my bot assigns a move to all the ants at once, so a solution involving an exchange isn't any worse than one where they sit still
2011-11-02T21:04:44  <roflmao> icefox: I don't see why anyone else would do anything else
2011-11-02T21:04:44  <ccc_> Antimony: you are says your implementation coincidentally does the exchange and you didn't code specifically for that? wow amazing,
2011-11-02T21:04:53  <Antimony> well
2011-11-02T21:05:03  <Antimony> the tie breaking behavior I chose increases the amount of switching
2011-11-02T21:05:08  <Antimony> but it still does lots of switching anyway
2011-11-02T21:05:08  <ikaros> ccc_, you can use a second map as target map for example
2011-11-02T21:05:28  <ccc_> ikaros: ooh! sounds interesting
2011-11-02T21:05:31  <ikaros> or you can implement a "push" command in an ant
2011-11-02T21:05:41  <ikaros> there are a lot of ways depending on your current code
2011-11-02T21:05:46  <Rinum> from the convos today, seems like ppl are ditching A*?
2011-11-02T21:05:50  <bobbydroptable> i suppose switching ants is a way of dealing with map buffers?
2011-11-02T21:06:03  <ccc_> well my current code is just checking for empty spots, i can re-write the whole thing anyway
2011-11-02T21:06:11  <bobbydroptable> Rinum: the problem with A* is with the heuristic.

2011-11-02T21:06:41  <bobbydroptable> Rinum: if you can find a quicker way to compute the heuristic (i.e. distance map, map diffusion as icefox mentioned) then A* becomes more useful
2011-11-02T21:06:44  <ikaros> if you want to go oop style you can implement a push function in the ant class
2011-11-02T21:06:59  <Rinum> I see
2011-11-02T21:07:06  <roflmao> rinum: for this game, bfs is better
2011-11-02T21:07:09  <ikaros> and if an ant wants to move to a tile where already an ant is it calls its push
2011-11-02T21:07:11  <roflmao> rinum: it still gives the optimal path

2011-11-02T21:07:28  <ikaros> the other ant then returns true if it moves or false in case it cant move
2011-11-02T21:07:28  <roflmao> rinum: generally a* is better if you are computing only a few paths, that way you limit the open node set a bit and it can be faster
2011-11-02T21:07:36  <Antimony> A* is only good for a specific target
2011-11-02T21:07:39  <roflmao> rinum: but since you're dealing with hundreds of pathfinds in this game
2011-11-02T21:07:40  <Antimony> or small set of targets
2011-11-02T21:07:45  <roflmao> what anti says
2011-11-02T21:07:45  <Rinum> roflmao: BFS takes a while though...
2011-11-02T21:07:51  <Antimony> BFS is good for finding unexplored squares
2011-11-02T21:07:53  <Antimony> since there are so many
2011-11-02T21:07:54  <roflmao> rinum: if it takes a while you are doing it wrong ;)
2011-11-02T21:07:59  <roflmao> rinum: it should take a few ms
2011-11-02T21:08:00  <Rinum> lol
2011-11-02T21:08:10  <ikaros> my bot needs < 5ms and does bfs for food and hills
2011-11-02T21:08:21  <roflmao> I had the same impression Rinum
2011-11-02T21:08:27  <roflmao> my bfs was taking full seconds
2011-11-02T21:08:30  <roflmao> but then i fixed it :P
2011-11-02T21:08:33  <ikaros> hehe
2011-11-02T21:08:46  <Antimony> or you can switch to C++ and do depth 90 BFS in under 50ms
2011-11-02T21:08:50  <Rinum> interesting... maybe I really did do something wrong
2011-11-02T21:09:01  <Rinum> Antimony: yup, I'm considering doing that
2011-11-02T21:09:01  <icefox> How long did you guys go before you bother to compute the flip point of the map?
2011-11-02T21:09:03  <roflmao> My huge mistake (and it was a big one) was I was doing a "contains?" command on a LINKED LIST
2011-11-02T21:09:10  <icefox> heh
2011-11-02T21:09:19  <Antimony> what's the flippoint?
2011-11-02T21:09:20  <roflmao> BFS has open huge sets, so it was searching through a 2thousand long queue
2011-11-02T21:09:24  <roflmao> something completely unnecessary
2011-11-02T21:09:29  <icefox> Antimony: all of the maps are symetrical
2011-11-02T21:09:31  <Antimony> open sets should only grow linearly
2011-11-02T21:09:36  <Antimony> so you're doing something wrong
2011-11-02T21:09:38  <Rinum>  take advantage of map symmetry to get ant hills
2011-11-02T21:09:42  <icefox> compute the flip point and you know what the map looks like that you haven't visited
2011-11-02T21:09:45  <roflmao> antimony: I was doing this
2011-11-02T21:09:54  <Antimony> I haven't bothered to try detecting patterns in the map
2011-11-02T21:09:57  <roflmao> if(open_set.contains? (neighbor) ) continue;
2011-11-02T21:10:05  <roflmao> ergo — don't add the neighbor to open set if it is already in it
2011-11-02T21:10:06  <Antimony> it's a relatively minor imporvement
2011-11-02T21:10:09  <ikaros> i would guess that it's faster to just explore the map with ants than computing the flip point :)
2011-11-02T21:10:13  <roflmao> but it was a stupid step that I didn't need
2011-11-02T21:10:29  <roflmao> here's an idea for anti-collision: pass-the-buck
2011-11-02T21:10:40  <icefox> Antimony: true, but it can give you a step up keeping them away from food and on the defense
2011-11-02T21:11:02  <ccc_> in A* openset implementations, are we required to sort the list each time, we need to pick the smallest val right?
2011-11-02T21:11:38  <roflmao> ccc_ yes
2011-11-02T21:11:49  <roflmao> you have to use a priority queue
2011-11-02T21:11:53  <roflmao> sorted by the "f score"
2011-11-02T21:12:01  <roflmao> "f score" = "h score" + "g score"
2011-11-02T21:12:04  <roflmao> h score being the heuristic cost
2011-11-02T21:12:14  <roflmao> and g score being the cost of what has already been travelled
2011-11-02T21:12:24  <roflmao> first node has a g score of 0, second has a g score of 1
2011-11-02T21:12:33  <ccc_> and when do i decide to breakout of the loop prematurely if i wanted to, what is a good approch
2011-11-02T21:12:46  <roflmao> well why do you want to break out :)
2011-11-02T21:12:50  <roflmao> depends on why
2011-11-02T21:13:22  <roflmao> unlike BFS, you do NOT want to evaluate the entire map with a*
2011-11-02T21:13:24  <ccc_> maybe between the food and ant there is a huge water line and i don't want to complete the A*
2011-11-02T21:13:29  <roflmao> ah, well

2011-11-02T21:24:12  <ecarpenter84> you could get a rough estimate of how many nodes you can process in a turn. divide by number of ants and only allow that many per ant

2011-11-02T21:25:22  <magiik> yeah or have a dynamic count limit based on some factors
2011-11-02T21:25:55  <ccc_> is anyone doing C-style SIGALRM's to not get timeout in general? is it worth looking into?
2011-11-02T21:26:21  <hjax> I'm thinking of keeping a list of every move done so far during a turn, so if 5 ants are falling back to protect the hill then it knows that it doesn't need to send any more
2011-11-02T21:26:32  <hjax> is this a good idea?
2011-11-02T21:27:01  <magiik> could be
2011-11-02T21:27:19  <magiik> kinda like how some people track if they've assigned an ant towards food so they dont assign other ants to the same food

2011-11-02T21:27:32  <hjax> also a priority system wouldn't hurt to go with it
2011-11-02T21:27:56  <hjax> then ants would protect the hill always instead of going for a food that was closer than the hill
2011-11-02T21:28:39  <hjax> unless getting that food spawned an ant at the hill faster than the other ant cool get to the hill, ahhh that's complex O.o
2011-11-02T21:28:49  <bobbydroptable> well i wanted to go for a "settlers" style network of ants. people who have played "settlers" would know what I'm talking about ^^
2011-11-02T21:29:07  <hjax> bobby, I have not, explain it
2011-11-02T21:29:08  <magiik> i saw some cool looking hill defense on another bot - made a diamond around the hill
2011-11-02T21:29:23  <magiik> whenever a new ant would spawn, an ant on the diamond would leave, and the new ant would take it's place
2011-11-02T21:29:27  <burny> hjax, or if going a different direction, is more likely to have a food spawn in range, faster than you can get back to base
2011-11-02T21:29:29  <magiik> the hill always had 4 ants guarding it
2011-11-02T21:29:37  <hjax> magiik I was thinking of doing that
2011-11-02T21:29:41  <roflmao> same
2011-11-02T21:29:42  <bobbydroptable> in settlers you set road intersections, and then a little villager goes over and sits at the intersection to send/receive goods
2011-11-02T21:29:52  <hjax> exactly burny
2011-11-02T21:30:08  <bobbydroptable> if you put goal weights on your intersections, and keep track of how many ants have gone through, you'll know when to stop sending ants back
2011-11-02T21:30:26  <user`> What would actual ants do?
2011-11-02T21:30:28  <bobbydroptable> then ant behavior becomes a lot more simpler
2011-11-02T21:30:31  <hjax> I was thinking of sending scouts out for the pure purpose of destroying hills, suicide mission

2011-11-02T21:31:10  <magiik> phermone trails make more sense when ants need to go back to the hill
2011-11-02T21:31:18  <magiik> without having to ever go back to the hill, phermones dont make as much sense
2011-11-02T21:31:29  <magiik> ants leave the phermone trail to follow on the way back from food IIRC

2011-11-02T21:31:58  <magiik> i need to think of a better way to keep ants spread apart across the map
2011-11-02T21:32:22  <bobbydroptable> i remember someone mentioning xenophobia as a possible strategy for doing that
2011-11-02T21:32:29  <hjax> if it sees an ant, it sends 3 to "fit" the puzzle, killing the enemy without sacrificing ants
2011-11-02T21:32:53  <user`> make your ants hate each other
2011-11-02T21:33:03  <hjax> that's clever
2011-11-02T21:33:05  <bobbydroptable> and they'll naturally separate
2011-11-02T21:33:13  <magiik> but at the same time you want them to separate
2011-11-02T21:33:17  <magiik> at other times you want them to congregate heh
2011-11-02T21:33:28  <magiik> what's a good simple mechanism to switch xenophobia on or off
2011-11-02T21:33:51  <magiik> well i guess i'm glossing over the xenophobic implementation too
2011-11-02T21:33:54  <roflmao> I was thinking of a pass the buck system
2011-11-02T21:33:57  <roflmao> haven't tried it though
2011-11-02T21:34:00  <hjax> I think that I'd try to establish a grid like network of ants, just enough to clear all fog of war, as food spawns grab it, and return to grid position
2011-11-02T21:34:13  <user`> Shouldn't xenophobia be fear of enemy ants? not your own other ants?
2011-11-02T21:34:28  <roflmao> both are actually useful user
2011-11-02T21:34:33  <roflmao> xenophobia of enemy ants is great
2011-11-02T21:34:38  <roflmao> because if you are going to raze an enemy hill
2011-11-02T21:34:39  <bobbydroptable> hjax: already tried that. if you figure it out, let me know
2011-11-02T21:34:42  <roflmao> you want to wait until there are few ants around the hill
2011-11-02T21:34:53  <magiik> that's more of the sneak raze
2011-11-02T21:34:56  <roflmao> then you send in your ants and capture it without sacrificing a ton of your own ants in a huge battle (which might look cool)
2011-11-02T21:34:58  <roflmao> yeah, sneak raze
2011-11-02T21:35:08  <hjax> bobby, I'll try, no promises of me figuring it out either
2011-11-02T21:35:09  <roflmao> fkin sneak razers are pro
2011-11-02T21:35:11  <magiik> i'm all for the looking cool for now ;)
2011-11-02T21:35:25  <bobbydroptable> hjax: just to give you a headstart, the problems i had were namely with deciding where to put the network nodes on an unknown map
2011-11-02T21:35:26  <user`> I'd like an efficient way of determining how many ants are near a cell
2011-11-02T21:35:39  <magiik> man i turned off my hill attacking code, set turntime to 5 seconds, and ran my bot with --food 1 - it hit like 800 ants lol
2011-11-02T21:35:40  <roflmao> just use the manhattan heuristic
2011-11-02T21:35:49  <roflmao> easy peasy
2011-11-02T21:36:11  <user`> so O(n) for 5^n moves
2011-11-02T21:36:24  <roflmao> I'm not a formal computer science student
2011-11-02T21:36:30  <hjax> bobbydroptable: generate your own copy of the map as you explore, then update the grid as you go?
2011-11-02T21:36:34  <magiik> neither am i, i'm a firmware engineer
2011-11-02T21:36:37  <roflmao> I don't know what the fuck all those o(n)'s mean
2011-11-02T21:36:44  <hjax> I'm a high school student, :D
2011-11-02T21:36:45  <roflmao> but I've seen them a lot :P
2011-11-02T21:36:55  <user`> loops are expensive, nesting them even more so
2011-11-02T21:36:57  <magiik> it's the worst case time for an algorithm
2011-11-02T21:37:17  <magiik> more or less
2011-11-02T21:37:19  <bobbydroptable> hjax: already did that. but where do you place nodes? it seems like such a straight forward thing to do for a human, but I couldn't get the AI to do it for me.
2011-11-02T21:37:29  <user`> placing a loop checking the distance of an ant for a cell is something I'd like to be very cheap as it will be inside all my other loops

2011-11-02T21:37:51  <roflmao> well if you devise a way p[lease tell
2011-11-02T21:37:59  <roflmao> because I'm facing the exact same issue ^.^
2011-11-02T21:38:07  <bobbydroptable> i tried thinking about flood fills to figure out how a room is laid out, but it wouldn't work very well for open maps
2011-11-02T21:38:19  <hjax> you need a starting position to build off of, maybe 3 squares from your base, then have an ant stationed as close as possible to every 10 squares from that point in a grid
2011-11-02T21:38:44  <roflmao> hey, why don't you just bfs it user?
2011-11-02T21:38:47  <bobbydroptable> you're assuming an open map. what happens if 10 squares away is split by water?
2011-11-02T21:38:56  <roflmao> BFS cost map from target square
2011-11-02T21:39:01  <bobbydroptable> what if it is a deadend and you can't path there directly?
2011-11-02T21:39:08  <magiik> bobbydroptable: then dont make it exactly 10, make it between 5-15
2011-11-02T21:39:10  <roflmao> then check your ants location on the cost map
2011-11-02T21:39:14  <bobbydroptable> those were the things i couldn't reconcile , so if you figure it out, let me know :p
2011-11-02T21:39:14  <hjax> that's why I said closest possible, of there's water then you have ants next to the water
2011-11-02T21:39:24  <roflmao> and you'll get exactly how far away they are
2011-11-02T21:39:27  <roflmao> yeah, that should work
2011-11-02T21:39:34  <magiik> and some places you might not even be able to place a grid
2011-11-02T21:40:04  <hjax> magiik that's true, this thing will take a lot of coding
2011-11-02T21:40:13  <hjax> but the advantages will be huge
2011-11-02T21:40:18  <magiik> yeah
2011-11-02T21:40:23  <bobbydroptable> haha good luck then.
2011-11-02T21:40:28  <bobbydroptable> i spent a week trying to code it
2011-11-02T21:40:31  <magiik> but i still wouldn't even know hwo to get the ants to push out to these grids
2011-11-02T21:40:37  <magiik> what happens when an ant dies - how do you get a new ant there?
2011-11-02T21:40:43  <bobbydroptable> i'm not saying you won't get it, i'm just saying it is fricking difficult
2011-11-02T21:41:16  <hjax> when an ant gets to a point on a grid you save it's point, possibly loop through the grid to check? but that's costly time wise
2011-11-02T21:41:45  <hjax> bobbydroptable: I agree, very hard
2011-11-02T21:42:10  <magiik> i think something like that should come out as a side effect of some other combo of algorithms
2011-11-02T21:42:21  <bobbydroptable> yeh exactly
2011-11-02T21:42:22  <magiik> like someone weas saying making the ants not want to be near each other
2011-11-02T21:42:29  <magiik> with some decent exploration code
2011-11-02T21:42:35  <pairofdice> Now, how come I only have one ant moving at a time
2011-11-02T21:42:35  <magiik> and they should naturally cover the map
2011-11-02T21:42:37  <hjax> magiik: maybe just wanting to eliminate fog of war as much as possible
2011-11-02T21:42:45  <magiik> yeah or that
2011-11-02T21:42:47  <magiik> that'd be a godo metric
2011-11-02T21:42:51  <magiik> reduce unvisible tiles
2011-11-02T21:43:08  <magiik> hrm........
2011-11-02T21:43:11  <magiik> that's interesting
2011-11-02T21:43:24  <magiik> what if every ant was like an imaginary ball the size of their view radius
2011-11-02T21:43:31  <hjax> pairofdice: are you looping through all of your ants?

2011-11-02T21:46:12  <magiik> which IMO is stupid, because if the food is next to you, you know it's going to be gone next turn, you should be able to move on that spot
2011-11-02T21:46:25  <hjax> I sort of want to get my AI to work like a kingdom, scouts/gathers getting food/clearing fog of war, groups of 4 ants being defenses, and groups of 8 being offensive armies

2011-11-02T21:48:32  <hjax> most maps have narrow passageways that can be held by 4 ants long enough for reinforcements
2011-11-02T21:48:50  <bobbydroptable> if you already have your visibility grid set up
2011-11-02T21:48:59  <bobbydroptable> those ants can just shuffle about to get food lying about anyway
2011-11-02T21:49:10  <hjax> exactly bobby
2011-11-02T21:49:15  <magiik> well if u have that and a swarm, i agree with you
2011-11-02T21:49:15  <bobbydroptable> if you have say 20 ants doing that.
2011-11-02T21:49:54  <magiik> it'd be kinda cool if by the end of this comp, the AI was getting crazy like doing dual pronged attacks, or flanking movements or distractions
2011-11-02T21:50:08  <bobbydroptable> also, the only "defensible" chokepoint is if the path is <= 2 wide
2011-11-02T21:50:17  <hjax> hmmm there's always the micromanaging formations thing, so they effectively kill swarms without loosing many ants
2011-11-02T21:50:34  <magiik> what exactly is the ant fighting resolution code
2011-11-02T21:50:37  <magiik> there's some randomness to it?
2011-11-02T21:50:51  <burny> no
2011-11-02T21:50:54  <magiik> IIRC the game specs were very vague like "your ant will die ( sometiems ) "
2011-11-02T21:51:12  <bobbydroptable> each ant gets a number (number of enemy ants it is close to)
2011-11-02T21:51:18  <Guest628> no, the game specs describe the ant fighting resolution very closely
2011-11-02T21:51:20  <bobbydroptable> then every ant with the highest number dies.
2011-11-02T21:51:45  <bobbydroptable> so if you have
2011-11-02T21:51:45  <bobbydroptable> XXX
2011-11-02T21:51:45  <bobbydroptable> XXX
2011-11-02T21:51:56  <bobbydroptable> the middle ants die because they both are close to 3 ants
2011-11-02T21:52:08  <bobbydroptable> while the others are close to only 2
2011-11-02T21:52:19  <burny> youmean xxx vs yyy?
2011-11-02T21:52:25  <bobbydroptable> yeh
2011-11-02T21:52:32  <bobbydroptable> oopsies
2011-11-02T21:52:40  <magiik> every ant with the highest number?

2011-11-02T21:52:50  <magiik> so if you have your example
2011-11-02T21:52:53  <magiik> then somewhere else on the map
2011-11-02T21:52:53  <magiik> you have
2011-11-02T21:52:54  <magiik> XXX
2011-11-02T21:52:55  <magiik> XYX
2011-11-02T21:52:56  <magiik> XXX
2011-11-02T21:53:01  <magiik> the Y's on the other side of the map wont die
2011-11-02T21:53:03  <magiik> because this Y has 9 ?
2011-11-02T21:53:12  <magiik> because it has the "highest number"
2011-11-02T21:53:17  <bobbydroptable> no no only for a particular battle instance.
2011-11-02T21:53:23  <magiik> how do u define a battle instance
2011-11-02T21:53:26  <burny> 8 not 9
2011-11-02T21:53:33  <pairofdice> It's very simple, more ants kill less ants
2011-11-02T21:53:38  <magiik> oh nm there's pseudo code
2011-11-02T21:53:39  <hjax> no magiik, it's probably highest number within some small distance
2011-11-02T21:53:47  <magiik> for each enemy in range of ant (using spawnradius2):
2011-11-02T21:53:47  <magiik>             if (enemies(of ant) in range of ant) >= (enemies(of enemy) in range of enemy) then
2011-11-02T21:53:50  <magiik>                 the ant dies
2011-11-02T21:54:12  <bobbydroptable> that's it
2011-11-02T21:54:16  <magiik> or i guess python looks too much like psuedo lol
2011-11-02T21:54:30  <magiik> no nm that's pseudo
2011-11-02T21:54:31  <bobbydroptable> that's not python . close, but no
2011-11-02T21:54:32  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-11-02T21:54:34  <pairofdice> python.. pseudo, what's the difference
2011-11-02T21:54:45  <bobbydroptable> python is a language
2011-11-02T21:54:47  <hjax> that's why I like python

2011-11-02T22:11:18  <bobbydroptable> i think he's talking about game trees... minimax?

2011-11-02T22:12:23  <jab_bott> user`: you could use probability maps, built up over time, to improve your A* search

2011-11-02T22:14:02  <bobbydroptable> user` that's why bfs is probably a better option. it gives you all possible moves with a given depth. a* gets you path to target which can be improved using some grid optimizations
2011-11-02T22:14:04  <magiik> well by size of the map i mean size of the longest path
2011-11-02T22:14:11  <magiik> which on some of those maze maps, A* gets fucked, badly
2011-11-02T22:14:41  <magiik> and then y eah, try dealing with that with 100+ ants, shit gets slow
2011-11-02T22:14:54  <jab_bott> user`: well if you've got lots of ants you're doing well, so why not have most of them sit around waiting for food to spawn, and only ones within a radius of other ants or anthills should try to think?

2011-11-02T22:15:44  <magiik> i've actually found that doing the A* sometimes actually helps
2011-11-02T22:15:53  <magiik> because you take that ant out of deciding algo's for X amount of steps
2011-11-02T22:16:16  <user`> so they will cheerfully walk into the enemy?
2011-11-02T22:16:34  <user`> hmm... anyone have a good way of splitting ants among goals?
2011-11-02T22:16:40  <magiik> well you can do less deciding algos ;)
2011-11-02T22:17:06  <user`> I do like to think of my ants as being cheerful when they do march
2011-11-02T22:17:08  <magiik> i've been just round-robin'ing closest ants
2011-11-02T22:17:20  <jab_bott> magiik: but how long are these paths? surely any one ant only has a fairly short path to consider at once, because it wouldn't be picking a goal on the opposite side of the map?
2011-11-02T22:17:40  <bobbydroptable> user` icefox was just recommending Diffusion maps
2011-11-02T22:17:46  <magiik> jab_bott: well my previous implementation i made a coarser map of the map, and saved paths between nodes
2011-11-02T22:17:56  <magiik> then i A*'d the map to be able to get very long paths across the map
2011-11-02T22:18:17  <user`> bobbydroptable : That's what I'm doing, so A* is the problem, is considering the permuations of possible moves for every ant
2011-11-02T22:18:23  <jab_bott> magiik: ahh so kind of like made coarse-grained waypoints?
2011-11-02T22:18:29  <magiik> yeah exactly
2011-11-02T22:18:33  <user`> * a* is _not_ the problem
2011-11-02T22:18:54  <magiik> it worked, it's just if you get off the set path, you have to re-calc back to a waypoint
2011-11-02T22:19:04  <magiik> and it didn't work welel if ants were trying to go both diretions on the path
2011-11-02T22:19:14  <magiik> i think if i worked on it a bit more, i could have gotten a reasonable solution
2011-11-02T22:19:18  <magiik> but i've since gone other directions

2011-11-02T22:19:30  <bobbydroptable> user` it shouldn't be an issue if you're using diffusion
2011-11-02T22:19:40  <bobbydroptable> the diffusion gives you a nice score that permeates through the map
2011-11-02T22:19:48  <jab_bott> I haven't really started work on my bot yet as I've been implementing this AI visualization stuff instead
2011-11-02T22:19:49  <bobbydroptable> and your ants will decide which way to head towards based on the score
2011-11-02T22:20:21  <user`> bobbydroptable : 5 possible moves per ant, 10 ants = 5^10 moves, which is roughly 9 million
2011-11-02T22:20:27  <magiik> hrm..... i wonder if i took multiple BFS and added them together
2011-11-02T22:20:47  <magiik> maybe have an inverse BFS type score thing to prevent ants from getting too close to each other
2011-11-02T22:20:52  <user`> an 11th ant makes it 48 million
2011-11-02T22:21:04  <magiik> add that on top of the goal BFS, to try to get the ants to separate while still aiming towards goals
2011-11-02T22:21:07  <magiik> hrm.....
2011-11-02T22:21:07  <bobbydroptable> user` that's probably not a good way to go about it :p
2011-11-02T22:21:37  <magiik> bobbydroptable: what's a diffusion map?
2011-11-02T22:22:04  <jab_bott> user`: if your plan is to calculate every possible move and score each one to decide which is best - well that's just not a very good plan :P

2011-11-02T22:23:23  <magiik> interesting ok, that actually sounds like something similar to my additive BFS thing i just dreamt up
2011-11-02T22:23:30  <magiik> i already see the BFS as a diffusion map
2011-11-02T22:23:38  <magiik> this just introduces different scoring systems

2011-11-02T22:27:29  <bobbydroptable> magiiik diffusion maps are implemented using BFS that's why
2011-11-02T22:27:30  <roflmao> oh
2011-11-02T22:27:42  <magiik> add in another one that makes ants want to get away from each other
2011-11-02T22:27:45  <luizribeiro> :/
2011-11-02T22:27:46  <magiik> a negative goal
2011-11-02T22:27:53  <magiik> and you might be able to spread them across the map too
2011-11-02T22:28:13  <ecarpenter84> you dont want to spread them too harshly though or they will get killed in combat
2011-11-02T22:28:16  <bobbydroptable> yes then all your ants do in the end is just "find highest score","move"
2011-11-02T22:28:20  <ecarpenter84> you need some mechanism to condense them if you see enemies
2011-11-02T22:28:25  <magiik> well - enemy ants can only move at the speed of your ants
2011-11-02T22:28:32  <magiik> so it's not like they can outrun you back to your other ants
2011-11-02T22:28:40  <bobbydroptable> ecarpenter84 you can put a negative goal when you see an ant saying "avoid"
2011-11-02T22:28:47  <bobbydroptable> to impact your other scores
2011-11-02T22:29:09  <ccc_> is there a common crowd moving algorithm
2011-11-02T22:29:30  <magiik> well - instead of having a negative goal for ants always - you could make ants that are near enemies  become positive goals
2011-11-02T22:29:37  <burny> ccc, check for herding or flocking
2011-11-02T22:29:41  <bobbydroptable> ccc_ it is easier to have a common "goal" for all ants.
2011-11-02T22:30:12  <magiik> interesting

2011-11-02T22:30:38  <magiik> i think i need to drop python, i dont think i can reliably do multiple BFS with python, either that or i wrote some horrible inefficient code

2011-11-02T22:32:05  <bobbydroptable> to get ants to explore more
2011-11-02T22:32:07  <magiik> i've found on smaller maps i can do a BFS in amout 100ms or less
2011-11-02T22:32:12  <magiik> on the large map, it takes like 400-500 ms

2011-11-02T23:05:37  <Zok_> Then I just edit those, zip em up and send em in?
2011-11-02T23:06:03  <SharkMonkey> Zok_, Tools are just for testing
2011-11-02T23:06:06  <ruser> Zok_: yes. you can test it localy run agains t prepackage bots by using the tools provided in the tools.zip
2011-11-02T23:06:08  <ccc_> Zok_: tools folder has a playgame.py script to simulate the game locally
2011-11-02T23:06:14  <SharkMonkey> THe starter packs are what you modify and submit
2011-11-02T23:07:26  <Zok_> I tried taking "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\python\GreedyBot.py""" and changed it to "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\csharp\GreedyBot.cs"""
2011-11-02T23:07:27  <bobbydroptable> you don't have to use the starter packs if you don't wish to, they are just there to do most of the grunt work of output/input commands, maintaining state and
2011-11-02T23:07:45  <bobbydroptable> .cs isn't python
2011-11-02T23:08:13  <bobbydroptable> to test it it does need to be compiled first.
2011-11-02T23:08:16  <Zok_> Okay, so I use playgame.py to do that?
2011-11-02T23:08:45  <Zok_> That = run the .cs
2011-11-02T23:08:45  <Zok_> But
2011-11-02T23:08:55  <Zok_> How do I go about compiling it?
2011-11-02T23:09:08  <ccc_> in place of "python example_bot" you need to give "your_cs_bot.exe" i guess, for that you need to compile locally
2011-11-02T23:09:11  <Zok_> What environment and project type do I place the files in?
2011-11-02T23:09:14  <bobbydroptable> what operating system?
2011-11-02T23:09:19  <Zok_> Windows
2011-11-02T23:09:23  <bobbydroptable> are you writing in Mono or Visual Studio?
2011-11-02T23:09:29  <bobbydroptable> Visual Studio?
2011-11-02T23:09:37  <Zok_> Preferably, but I installed Mono
2011-11-02T23:09:58  <bobbydroptable> if mono then apparently you go mcs MyBot.cs

2011-11-02T23:23:00  <Zok_> Let me first say that I worked through the first and possibly second set of errors, only to find a third...
2011-11-02T23:23:14  <Zok_> However, by "worked" I mean made the compiler happy
2011-11-02T23:23:21  <ecarpenter84> costMap[tile[0],tile[1]] = 1 TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple
2011-11-02T23:23:24  <ecarpenter84> anyone good at python?
2011-11-02T23:24:19  <luizribeiro> costMap[tile[0]][tile[1]]
2011-11-02T23:24:28  <luizribeiro> but that looks like C# code, not python

2011-11-02T23:25:10  <funkyjive> Hello all, quick question. Developing a bot in C++. Do I need to provide a makefile in the zip or is there a generic makefile on the server? If I have to provide my own I assume the server will call "make all"?

2011-11-02T23:26:30  <SharkMonkey> funkyjive, You don't provide a makefile. It just compiles everything based on the extesion MyBot.ext has
2011-11-02T23:26:45  <SharkMonkey> funkyjive, So if it's MyBot.cc it will compile it all as C++ files
2011-11-02T23:27:11  <funkyjive> so any .cc files get compiled? Thanks for the quick answer!
2011-11-02T23:28:23  <Zok_> Is a header file perhaps what I'm missing?
2011-11-02T23:28:46  <ecarpenter84> now when i set the costmap [row][col] to 1 it says out of range
2011-11-02T23:29:34  <SharkMonkey> Then you are probably giving it a row and/or col that's out of range then. :)
2011-11-02T23:30:06  <ecarpenter84> its an empty costmap
2011-11-02T23:30:20  <ecarpenter84> do i need to define it as two dimensional specifically?
2011-11-02T23:30:32  <ecarpenter84> costmap = 0
2011-11-02T23:30:37  <ecarpenter84> costmap = []*
2011-11-02T23:30:39  <ecarpenter84> is what im using
2011-11-02T23:30:54  <SharkMonkey> If it's a list based and not dict based you need to initialize the size
2011-11-02T23:31:05  <SharkMonkey> See how the python starter kit initializes the map with LAND
2011-11-02T23:31:42  <ecarpenter84> i dont see
2011-11-02T23:32:20  <SharkMonkey> Something like [[LAND for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows) ]

2011-11-02T23:37:30  <SharkMonkey> The list is easy. You just have to initialize the size.
2011-11-02T23:37:40  <SharkMonkey> But yeah, you don't have to initalize the dict
2011-11-02T23:38:00  <SharkMonkey> Well you would have to initalize the first dict actually
2011-11-02T23:38:03  <SharkMonkey> I was wrong
2011-11-02T23:38:07  <SharkMonkey> Since it's a nested dict
2011-11-02T23:38:15  <SharkMonkey> Or you can use a tuple as the key in the dict
2011-11-02T23:38:18  <ecarpenter84> can i have a tuple as ak ey
