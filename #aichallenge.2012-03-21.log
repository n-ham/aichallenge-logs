2012-03-21T10:06:54  <delt0r> mcstar: ?
2012-03-21T10:07:17  <mcstar> i went biking in sand again
2012-03-21T10:07:20  <mcstar> with slick tires
2012-03-21T10:07:36  <mcstar> antimatroid
2012-03-21T10:07:40  <delt0r> hehe
2012-03-21T10:07:52  <mcstar> i have blisters on my right hand
2012-03-21T10:08:07  <delt0r> I went on soft sand at speed from rock... and then tried to turn...
2012-03-21T10:08:25  <mcstar> haha love those
2012-03-21T10:08:25  <delt0r> everyone watching thought it was pretty funny
2012-03-21T10:08:50  <mcstar> it is much safer than doing the same on gravel
2012-03-21T10:09:00  <delt0r> true
2012-03-21T10:09:02  <mcstar> you cant really hurt yourself on sand
2012-03-21T10:09:16  <delt0r> well did a bit of skiing this season
2012-03-21T10:09:29  <delt0r> even soft snow at speed can bloody well hurt
2012-03-21T10:09:32  <mcstar> there was some sections where the road was wet a bit, i think my speed increased 3 fold
2012-03-21T10:09:41  <delt0r> my gps said i was going 80km/h at the time
2012-03-21T10:09:52  <mcstar> insane speed
2012-03-21T10:09:56  <mcstar> even on a bike
2012-03-21T10:10:08  <delt0r> good skiers go a bit faster than that
2012-03-21T10:10:15  <mcstar> my point
2012-03-21T10:10:15  <delt0r> or faster conditions...
2012-03-21T10:10:17  <mcstar> they are insane
2012-03-21T10:10:32  <delt0r> but it is soo much fun
2012-03-21T10:10:42  <mcstar> i have never skiiied
2012-03-21T10:10:56  <delt0r> esp early in the morning when you have the whole mountian to yourself..
2012-03-21T10:11:06  <delt0r> totally worth the 5am starts
2012-03-21T10:11:20  <mcstar> are your knees in good shape?
2012-03-21T10:11:25  <delt0r> well yea
2012-03-21T10:11:28  <mcstar> im sure mine arent
2012-03-21T10:11:35  <delt0r> did exersize over summer
2012-03-21T10:11:47  <mcstar> haha
2012-03-21T10:11:50  <mcstar> love your typos
2012-03-21T10:11:57  <delt0r> i had a  motor bike accident when i was younger
2012-03-21T10:12:20  <delt0r> mcstar: i am told i have my own english dialect
2012-03-21T10:12:34  <delt0r> busted up one knee a bit
2012-03-21T10:12:41  <delt0r> so i have to be careful
2012-03-21T10:12:49  <delt0r> anyway
2012-03-21T10:12:57  <delt0r> was looking at the ai website...
2012-03-21T10:13:02  <delt0r> php ...
2012-03-21T10:13:06  * delt0r shudders
2012-03-21T10:13:41  <mcstar> both of my knees hurt at a specific angle
2012-03-21T10:13:51  <mcstar> i almost cant hold my weight at that angle
2012-03-21T10:13:57  <mcstar> increadibly painful
2012-03-21T10:14:11  <delt0r> I am a bit lost on why it needs a rewrite or what in particular is the problem with the "framework"
2012-03-21T10:14:12  <mcstar> and i dont really have a good explanation why is that
2012-03-21T10:14:15  <delt0r> whatever that is
2012-03-21T10:14:31  <delt0r> mcstar: that is what one of my knees is like
2012-03-21T10:14:50  <delt0r> but if i get the muscles around the knee in shape, its a lot better
2012-03-21T10:15:01  <mcstar> good thing that it doesnt affect cycling/running
2012-03-21T10:15:06  <smiley1983> delt0r: I have also been trying to work out what needs rewriting in the backend, and it doesn't seem obvious from the issues list
2012-03-21T10:15:29  <mcstar> what are you guys talking about? aichallenge?
2012-03-21T10:15:37  <delt0r> smiley1983: oh yea issues list... is that in the gitrepo?
2012-03-21T10:15:52  <smiley1983> delt0r: yes, but it looks like it hasn't been updated in a while
2012-03-21T10:16:01  <delt0r> smiley1983: well its kind of a big ball of code... but websites always get like that
2012-03-21T10:16:14  <smiley1983> mcstar: yeah, sorry to change the subject :)
2012-03-21T10:16:28  <mcstar> np
2012-03-21T10:16:39  <mcstar> just wasnt sure what php
2012-03-21T10:16:55  <smiley1983> I remember that one of the things they didn't like was the difficulty in setting up a contest server instance
2012-03-21T10:17:47  <delt0r> right...
2012-03-21T10:18:09  <smiley1983> but I'm not sure a complete rewrite is going to make that better :)
2012-03-21T10:18:23  <delt0r> well if i was starting again i would not use php...
2012-03-21T10:18:24  <delt0r> BUT
2012-03-21T10:18:32  <delt0r> i am not sure what i would use instead...
2012-03-21T10:18:43  <delt0r> perhaps php is not so bad for something like this
2012-03-21T10:19:07  <mcstar> try haskell
2012-03-21T10:19:34  <delt0r> for a web site?
2012-03-21T10:19:37  <delt0r> i don't think so
2012-03-21T10:20:00  <mcstar> http://snapframework.com/
2012-03-21T10:20:16  <mcstar> site looks nice
2012-03-21T10:23:25  <mcstar> i just saw it today, know nothing about it
2012-03-21T10:23:40  <mcstar> it looks smart to say 'try haskell' these days
2012-03-21T10:23:42  <mcstar> doesnt it?
2012-03-21T10:23:55  <pairofdice> Try Haskell
2012-03-21T10:24:07  <mcstar> hey, thats a good idea!
2012-03-21T10:24:12  <delt0r> haskell is fine... untill you need to use it for real work
2012-03-21T10:24:34  <mcstar> then use common lisp
2012-03-21T10:24:55  <mcstar> (made with secret alien technology)
2012-03-21T10:24:59  <mcstar> XD
2012-03-21T10:25:14  <mcstar> that slogan is catchy, you have to admit it
2012-03-21T10:25:58  <mcstar> pairofdice: are you done with this week's cryto material?
2012-03-21T10:26:46  <mcstar> delt0r: or try clojure
2012-03-21T10:27:07  <mcstar> you know the java economy very well dont you?
2012-03-21T10:27:16  <pairofdice> doing cs373: SkyNetCar
2012-03-21T10:27:29  <mcstar> is it more interesting that crypto?
2012-03-21T10:27:32  <mcstar> than*
2012-03-21T10:27:46  <mcstar> i guess the homework is much thicker
2012-03-21T10:28:16  <pairofdice> It started earlier so I've stayed with it
2012-03-21T10:28:22  <pairofdice> And it's interesting
2012-03-21T10:28:42  <mcstar> it sounds like you abandoned crypto, is that so?
2012-03-21T10:29:08  <pairofdice> Nah
2012-03-21T10:29:29  <delt0r> mcstar: yea... i know the java eco system well --at least 6 years ago wrt web stuff
2012-03-21T10:29:36  <delt0r> did enterprise stuff etc
2012-03-21T10:30:18  <delt0r> mcstar: using lisp does sound tempting
2012-03-21T10:30:19  <mcstar> delt0r: so have you considered clojure at all?
2012-03-21T10:30:23  <delt0r> yes
2012-03-21T10:30:48  <delt0r> but for a website like this it seems prudent to use something more people are familiar with
2012-03-21T10:31:16  <mcstar> then why not write the site in python too?
2012-03-21T10:31:16  <delt0r> clojure should have kept the syntax as clean as lisp IMO
2012-03-21T10:31:59  <delt0r> mcstar: i think this was the main thrust of it... only can you do like html+phython easily like php?
2012-03-21T10:32:14  <mcstar> well, but this way most of clojure's data structure is readable

2012-03-21T10:32:24  <mcstar> and the [] makes some sense
2012-03-21T10:32:55  <delt0r> well some lisp compilers let you use [] and {} as direct substitutes for ()
2012-03-21T10:33:25  <mcstar> you can use keys as lookup functions

2012-03-21T10:58:51  <mcstar> scientific or general?
2012-03-21T10:59:12  <delt0r> its ends up being very easy to be moving massive amounts of data round in RAM that no amount of DMAs can speed up

2012-03-21T11:00:35  <delt0r> operators and == do a lot of bitwise object copying... as does STL
2012-03-21T11:00:44  <mcstar> i see
2012-03-21T11:00:51  <delt0r> i am talking about just in a method body
2012-03-21T11:01:01  <delt0r> to first order it does not matter
2012-03-21T11:01:33  <delt0r> but its performance trap if you are not aware for critical parts of the code
2012-03-21T11:02:00  <mcstar> i cant imagine writing some massive amount of code in it
2012-03-21T11:02:21  <mcstar> im writing this qt stuff now, but my classes are pretty interdependent

2012-03-21T11:02:28  <delt0r> mcstar: my perfect lang. lisp with a stander lib like java that runs on just about anything
2012-03-21T11:02:42  <delt0r> mcstar: well it is gui stuff
2012-03-21T11:02:42  <mcstar> abcl?
2012-03-21T11:02:50  <delt0r> its always ugly in the end
2012-03-21T11:02:55  <delt0r> yea
2012-03-21T11:03:09  <delt0r> abcl is almost 100% lisp finsihed now
2012-03-21T11:03:09  <mcstar> did you use it?
2012-03-21T11:03:16  <delt0r> no
2012-03-21T11:03:21  <delt0r> sorry not abcl
2012-03-21T11:03:38  <delt0r> yea.. abcl does not run everywhere and it does not have the libs that java has
2012-03-21T11:03:58  <mcstar> what you cant interoperate with java?
2012-03-21T11:04:00  <delt0r> here is a lisp that runs on the jvm that is almost finished... as in 100% clisp
2012-03-21T11:04:19  <mcstar> wait im confused
2012-03-21T11:04:22  <delt0r> abcl is not the lisp on the jvm is it?
2012-03-21T11:04:26  <mcstar> it is
2012-03-21T11:04:27  <delt0r> me too
2012-03-21T11:04:32  <mcstar> armed bear common lisp
2012-03-21T11:04:38  <mcstar> a jar file
2012-03-21T11:04:42  * delt0r puts on his confused face
2012-03-21T11:04:43  <mcstar> if you compile it
2012-03-21T11:04:58  <mcstar> i did couple of days ago for testing
2012-03-21T11:05:07  <mcstar> clisp is a byte-compiler for CL
2012-03-21T11:05:15  <mcstar> quite slow, but some say its useful
2012-03-21T11:05:16  <delt0r> right... yea well last time i tried it it wasn't quite complete...
2012-03-21T11:05:30  <delt0r> that is the jvm one i meant
2012-03-21T11:05:47  <delt0r> but i would have a few changes to lisp to make it better.
2012-03-21T11:06:12  <mcstar> why isnt clojure ideal then?
2012-03-21T11:06:14  <delt0r> optimal strong typing. aka a strict keyword
2012-03-21T11:06:24  <delt0r> continuations
2012-03-21T11:06:49  <delt0r> clojure is kinda --but again i really like the clean syntax of lisp...
2012-03-21T11:07:04  <delt0r> also i am waiting for a project for me to use it on
2012-03-21T11:07:14  <mcstar> afaik you could get used to it
2012-03-21T11:07:22  <delt0r> right now... java is still the best tool for my current job
2012-03-21T11:07:45  <mcstar> ive seen some java snippets, but its soo much boilerplate isnt it?
2012-03-21T11:08:03  <delt0r> too much? it is not more than C/C++
2012-03-21T11:08:08  <delt0r> which is perhaps too much
2012-03-21T11:08:12  <mcstar> thats too much too
2012-03-21T11:08:31  <delt0r> but it take what 20 sec to write boilerplate and how long to debug and dev an app
2012-03-21T11:08:50  <delt0r> its like having two letter function names because it is less typing
2012-03-21T11:08:58  <delt0r> its not the biggest problem with these langs
2012-03-21T11:09:27  <mcstar> what is?
2012-03-21T11:09:31  <mcstar> mutability?
2012-03-21T11:09:32  <delt0r> and well you also end up writing a lot of boilerplat in python too IME
2012-03-21T11:10:14  <delt0r> mcstar: well the C like langs IMO all have this "its still the 60s, and we know better than the compiler"
2012-03-21T11:10:18  <delt0r> feel to them
2012-03-21T11:10:28  <mcstar> true
2012-03-21T11:10:48  <delt0r> java is better than C/C++ in this regard... but still i feel we should be much futher along that we are
2012-03-21T11:10:56  <delt0r> its 2012 for gods sake
2012-03-21T11:11:37  <delt0r> I use things like "find bugs" etc... but better tools to find bugs before there are bugs
2012-03-21T11:12:40  <delt0r> would be good... perhaps better typing .. ie static typing, but inferred
2012-03-21T11:12:55  <delt0r> haskell has a nice type system
2012-03-21T11:13:05  <mcstar> the haskell type ssytem is its biggest selling point
2012-03-21T11:13:26  <delt0r> better matching syntax. like haskell's case things
2012-03-21T11:13:41  <delt0r> these are great. easy to read. easy to get right
2012-03-21T11:14:03  <mcstar> have you tried writing sequential code in haskell?
2012-03-21T11:14:31  <delt0r> and finally we need better standard libs... the fact that we still don't have tcp/ip in the standard C libs is a disgrace

2012-03-21T11:22:08  <delt0r> I did ask
2012-03-21T11:22:15  <delt0r> all i got was look at the code...
2012-03-21T11:22:27  <delt0r> and "it really needs a rewrite"
2012-03-21T11:22:55  <delt0r> mcleopold would be keep for python i guess
2012-03-21T11:23:21  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if this would be a good idea or not
2012-03-21T11:23:44  <antimatroid> but if a tcp server was first to be set up with past games etc. it could help bringing in some more contributers
2012-03-21T11:23:50  <delt0r> well its the web... even a really bad idea, is probably still better than all the other ideas
2012-03-21T11:24:07  <antimatroid> i'd be worried there aren't enough people to complete a rewrite even if it was somewhat organised

2012-03-21T11:24:54  <antimatroid> if not non-existent
2012-03-21T11:25:02  <delt0r> since a lot of the thing is in python already it makes some sense
2012-03-21T11:25:19  <delt0r> if i did it in java i think i would be the only contributor :P
2012-03-21T11:25:39  <janzert> I'm not the proponent for the complete rewrite, but I believe the motivation is to replace the php website with a python site that is better organized and the backend with python that is much more complicated and ornate :P

2012-03-21T11:26:33  <delt0r> janzert: so you don't think a rewirte is needed? just a clean up?
2012-03-21T11:26:36  <antimatroid> i don't know what to tell people needs fixing up etc.
2012-03-21T11:27:01  <delt0r> i am looking at putting some time into this soon... just to have something else to do...
2012-03-21T11:27:05  <antimatroid> what if we started a page on the wiki of what currently is too buggy to be "acceptable"?
2012-03-21T11:27:36  <antimatroid> something being done has to be better than nothing at present :)
2012-03-21T11:27:38  <janzert> I think the backend works pretty well, although there are things that should be moved back out of the database (specifically mostly the matchmaking)

2012-03-21T11:30:14  <antimatroid> would it not be feasible to start working on a new game then? it took almost a year to get Ants ready to launch
2012-03-21T11:30:30  <delt0r> so the non profit status is hard to change? (in NZ it is really easy)
2012-03-21T11:30:53  <antimatroid> delt0r: a new tcp server is definitely needed, and preferably an official one at that
2012-03-21T11:31:10  <delt0r> where is the current one? not hosted?
2012-03-21T11:31:23  <antimatroid> there's github copies
2012-03-21T11:31:26  <janzert> if organizational issues were taken care of I would like to see a multiplayer game fitted into the current system and run quickly while people interested in the rewrite worked on getting that up seperately
2012-03-21T11:31:34  <delt0r> also even if not officaly non profit.. you can still accept donations..

2012-03-21T11:32:10  <janzert> mostly non-profit just needs Jeff to either do it or hand off to someone that is willing to do it

2012-03-21T11:32:47  <smiley1983> I knew tron would have to be rewritten, but I had forgotten that pw was in Java (was there a Python version implemented eventually?)
2012-03-21T11:33:04  <antimatroid> pw was in java? :S
2012-03-21T11:33:04  <janzert> the server engine was python
2012-03-21T11:33:09  *** coeus <coeus!~coeus@dslb-084-061-056-177.pools.arcor-ip.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2012-03-21T11:33:12  <delt0r> janzert: why does Jeff need to be so involved when, tbh, he seems to never even be around?
2012-03-21T11:33:34  <janzert> because he is still the person ultimately in charge
2012-03-21T11:33:52  <delt0r> pw? what is pw?
2012-03-21T11:33:53  <janzert> if he would hand it off then we'd be ok too
2012-03-21T11:33:54  <mcstar> he brings the money
2012-03-21T11:34:01  <janzert> planetwars
2012-03-21T11:34:07  <delt0r> and you know java is not like well cancer or anything
2012-03-21T11:34:09  <antimatroid> if he is going to be back in some distant future then that's fine, but i wonder if that's realistic?
2012-03-21T11:34:19  <antimatroid> otherwise it's about time he passed that on
2012-03-21T11:34:28  <smiley1983> I also wasn't sure that I had retrieved the most recent pw code; I used the Ants git repo and backtracked, but may not have gone to the correct point
2012-03-21T11:34:43  <delt0r> its always... well we haven't got a reply from Jeff yet
2012-03-21T11:34:51  <delt0r> imo that is not in charge
2012-03-21T11:34:54  <delt0r> that is MIA
2012-03-21T11:35:08  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i wouldn't worry too much about the games atm, i'd assume you have a working python engine and what not
2012-03-21T11:35:17  <janzert> smiley1983: look under tags
2012-03-21T11:35:35  <antimatroid> try to generalise tcp to work for multiple games with a "format" then make sure past games are fixed up to work for that "format" after
2012-03-21T11:36:06  <delt0r> janzert: so say writing up some mplayer asteroids and just rolling it out would be something you are interested in?
2012-03-21T11:36:19  <janzert> the way the planetwars engine interfaced with the system was completely different than the ants did
2012-03-21T11:36:25  <smiley1983> janzert: Thank you! that's what I was looking for the other day :)
2012-03-21T11:36:35  <antimatroid> could that be generalised though? so it wasn't different?
2012-03-21T11:36:54  <antimatroid> i don't think running past contest games has to be the exact same code from those contests
2012-03-21T11:36:57  <janzert> delt0r: not without the organization issue being solved first though
2012-03-21T11:37:02  <delt0r> dammit
2012-03-21T11:37:13  * delt0r mumbles under his breath
2012-03-21T11:37:20  <delt0r> forkit!
2012-03-21T11:37:33  <delt0r> i don't really mean that...
2012-03-21T11:37:35  <janzert> it just caused to much trouble for ants, I'm not interested in doing that again
2012-03-21T11:37:38  <delt0r> just it sounds like
2012-03-21T11:37:51  <delt0r> janzert: what troubles?
2012-03-21T11:37:58  <delt0r> i think i missed it
2012-03-21T11:38:17  <janzert> money problems mostly
2012-03-21T11:38:27  <delt0r> really, as in no money?
2012-03-21T11:38:42  <janzert> people wanting to donate and us sending mixed messages about how and the possibility of
2012-03-21T11:38:50  <delt0r> what does Jeff do for a day job?
2012-03-21T11:38:52  <delt0r> ic
2012-03-21T11:39:02  <antimatroid> programmer for a finance firm i think
2012-03-21T11:39:08  <janzert> something in finance, yeah
2012-03-21T11:39:11  <delt0r> hft ehh
2012-03-21T11:39:19  <delt0r> well that explains a lot
2012-03-21T11:39:39  <antimatroid> jeff has also had to do some weird stuff previously i think taxwise because we're not a non-profit
2012-03-21T11:39:42  <delt0r> no time... but the forlorn hope that he will have time to have a life and a hobby
2012-03-21T11:39:44  <delt0r> sucker
2012-03-21T11:39:59  <janzert> right we're really not anything :)
2012-03-21T11:40:08  <delt0r> you just need to pay tax...
2012-03-21T11:40:26  <delt0r> not the end of the world
2012-03-21T11:40:38  <antimatroid> so roadmap: 1. Become a non-profit, 2. set up new game, ..., 4. non-profit!?
2012-03-21T11:40:43  <janzert> so all money essentially is Jeff's personal income or whoever accepts it I suppose
2012-03-21T11:41:13  <delt0r> yea and others can't use it as a tax credit... or whatever you call it in the US
2012-03-21T11:41:33  <antimatroid> tax deduction here
2012-03-21T11:41:49  <janzert> so even if we were a 'for profit' would be better, but if we are going to set up anything it isn't much more trouble to setup the non-profit
2012-03-21T11:42:32  <delt0r> So in NZ we can just register as  a non profit club/church/community group
2012-03-21T11:42:41  <antimatroid> what's happened to amstan too?
2012-03-21T11:42:46  <antimatroid> he seems to have mostly disappeared
2012-03-21T11:42:54  <delt0r> it takes about 3 hours to get the form and filling it in and getting filled
2012-03-21T11:43:04  <delt0r> does the US have something similar?
2012-03-21T11:43:21  <antimatroid> i think in canada (where this will be done) they need like 2 people's names on there etc.
2012-03-21T11:43:34  <janzert> fairly, but Jeff, et al. are Canadian :)
2012-03-21T11:43:35  <antimatroid> it didn't sound that easy when people described it in the past anyway
2012-03-21T11:43:41  <delt0r> Canada? well i am in canada this summer
2012-03-21T11:43:54  <antimatroid> summer in whose terms? :P
2012-03-21T11:44:23  <antimatroid> summer is ending D:
2012-03-21T11:44:29  <delt0r> july and i will be in Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto
2012-03-21T11:44:56  <delt0r> I could party with Jeff :D
2012-03-21T11:45:08  <janzert> Yeah, when you're in Toronto look up amstan and Jeff
2012-03-21T11:45:12  * delt0r thinks about beer
2012-03-21T11:45:26  <delt0r> cool amstan is there too
2012-03-21T11:45:29  <delt0r> didn't know that
2012-03-21T11:45:49  <janzert> one or two others as well
2012-03-21T11:45:52  <jbroman> Dunno if amstan is still in Toronto. Thought he was living in Hamilton most of the time.
2012-03-21T11:46:06  <jbroman> (at Mohawk College)
2012-03-21T11:46:11  <janzert> ahh
2012-03-21T11:46:25  <jbroman> Would have to check with him as I'm not 100% on that.
2012-03-21T11:47:02  <antimatroid> jbroman might be there though
2012-03-21T11:47:14  <antimatroid> jbroman: where is amstan these days? :P
2012-03-21T11:47:20  <delt0r> janzert: so in summary, do nothing. :(
2012-03-21T11:47:42  <janzert> unfortunately
2012-03-21T11:48:02  <janzert> occasional emails to Jeff probably wouldn't hurt
2012-03-21T11:48:19  <delt0r> and ask what?
2012-03-21T11:48:39  <delt0r> if he is not replying to you, i will be going into the spam folder
2012-03-21T11:49:42  <janzert> yeah, just something to bump it back into his consciousness I suppose
2012-03-21T11:50:03  <janzert> I'm personally heading into my busy time for work so won't be around much again
2012-03-21T11:50:13  <delt0r> it will just be work... I worked for a finance company once.
2012-03-21T11:50:31  <delt0r> no life outside sleep and work
2012-03-21T11:50:45  <delt0r> that is why i am now back at uni ... less pay
2012-03-21T11:50:49  <delt0r> great life
2012-03-21T11:51:08  <delt0r> janzert: what is your day job?
2012-03-21T11:51:31  <janzert> family Audio/Visual business
2012-03-21T11:51:47  <janzert> basically business meeting presentations
2012-03-21T11:52:07  <janzert> mostly for medical groups
2012-03-21T11:52:59  <delt0r> nice.. sounds different
2012-03-21T11:54:38  <janzert> yeah, it's certainly not bad but can be hard to explain :)
2012-03-21T11:58:53  <mcstar> 'dont worry if you lose your 56bit DES key, in 22 hours you can essentialy recover it' lol
2012-03-21T11:59:08  <janzert> hehe
2012-03-21T12:04:43  <delt0r> mcstar: 22 hours? I think you can do a bit quicker than that
2012-03-21T12:04:55  <mcstar> its from 1997
2012-03-21T12:05:42  <mcstar> but that was some 120 FPGA chips
2012-03-21T12:06:31  <delt0r> well i think a modern GPU could do it in like 10 hours or something these days.
2012-03-21T12:06:48  <delt0r> well i guess it depends on how well DES fits modern CPU/GPUs
2012-03-21T12:06:59  <mcstar> very well
2012-03-21T12:07:20  <mcstar> point is, 56bit DES is insecure
2012-03-21T12:08:08  <mcstar> guy shows us how to crack double-DES now
2012-03-21T12:09:06  <delt0r> well there is not really a double des.. rather a 2 key tripple des
2012-03-21T12:13:47  <jbroman> delt0r: Because Double-DES is vulnerable to a meet-in-the-middle attack, of course.
2012-03-21T12:16:59  <delt0r> i know
2012-03-21T12:17:04  <delt0r> that is why i said it
2012-03-21T12:17:11  <delt0r> there is not a 2 Des ...
2012-03-21T12:20:23  <antimatroid> damnit, stop making me interested in things!
2012-03-21T12:20:26  <mcstar> there is, people just dont use it
2012-03-21T12:21:24  <mcstar> cryptography is just as interesting as skydiving, so i wont really get excited antimatroid
2012-03-21T12:21:42  <antimatroid> skydiving sounds awesome
2012-03-21T12:22:00  <antimatroid> i love freefall
2012-03-21T12:22:13  <mcstar> i fall free love
2012-03-21T12:22:15  <antimatroid> i jumped off a 15m bridge once
2012-03-21T12:22:20  <antimatroid> plop
2012-03-21T12:22:52  <mcstar> furtunate, that architects build bridges over water

2012-03-21T12:25:54  <delt0r> mcstar: I do cryptography and skydiving!
2012-03-21T12:26:48  <delt0r> antimatroid: interesting application of crypto ... bitcoin
2012-03-21T12:27:10  * delt0r cackles an evil laugh 
2012-03-21T12:27:22  <delt0r> now you'll never get any work done
2012-03-21T12:27:46  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i'd live here forver if i could
2012-03-21T12:28:36  <antimatroid> the bridge is in WA though
2012-03-21T12:28:40  <delt0r> well i want to stay in Vienna forever, but i may need to shift soon.. and/or find a job
2012-03-21T12:28:59  <antimatroid> the "waterhole thing" is up mount wellington in hobart though (damn that water was cold!)
2012-03-21T12:29:13  <antimatroid> i'm good here for another 3 years cause of phd
2012-03-21T12:29:22  <antimatroid> i'm pretty much out of options here after that
2012-03-21T12:29:37  <delt0r> I applied for a job at the uni there...
2012-03-21T12:29:39  <antimatroid> i might try hft then which means sydney
2012-03-21T12:29:41  <delt0r> didn't get it however
2012-03-21T12:29:48  <delt0r> god no
2012-03-21T12:29:49  <antimatroid> yeah you mentioned, that sucks :(
2012-03-21T12:29:51  <delt0r> don't do it
2012-03-21T12:29:55  <antimatroid> but money
2012-03-21T12:30:02  <antimatroid> and it sounds not that different to ai
2012-03-21T12:30:04  <antimatroid> games
2012-03-21T12:30:07  <delt0r> selling your sole like that
2012-03-21T12:30:11  <delt0r> soul
2012-03-21T12:30:13  <delt0r> hehe
2012-03-21T12:31:08  <delt0r> no hft is about a small group of people who are allowed to play by different rules than the rest of us.
2012-03-21T12:31:39  <delt0r> if its good for the economy etc, then it should be for everyone.
2012-03-21T12:31:41  <mcstar> hft?
2012-03-21T12:31:50  <delt0r> High Frequency Trading
2012-03-21T12:32:02  <delt0r> All sorts of wrong

2012-03-21T12:32:31  <antimatroid> how are the rules different for hft people?
2012-03-21T12:32:35  <delt0r> even exploit matching algo behaviors with stuffing etc
2012-03-21T12:32:40  <antimatroid> i'm not sold on it being inherently bad as some people claim
2012-03-21T12:32:40  <delt0r> basically cheating
2012-03-21T12:33:01  <antimatroid> finance is not zero sum either
2012-03-21T12:33:08  <delt0r> antimatroid: i am not either... but then i am not alowed to do it
2012-03-21T12:33:10  <delt0r> why
2012-03-21T12:33:19  <delt0r> because i am not them... that makes it wrong
2012-03-21T12:33:24  <antimatroid> do you know what a comparative advantage is?
2012-03-21T12:34:00  <delt0r> oh and when there algos go all insane and cost one of these elite a lot of cash. Hours of trade are rolled backed
2012-03-21T12:34:32  <antimatroid> sure, but humans fuck up too
2012-03-21T12:34:37  <delt0r> antimatroid: finance is zero sum on typical time scales
2012-03-21T12:35:00  <delt0r> antimatroid: So why the fuck can't I by a HFT brokerage account?
2012-03-21T12:35:08  <delt0r> it is not open
2012-03-21T12:35:18  <delt0r> its for a specail few with special treatment
2012-03-21T12:35:19  <antimatroid> hmm okay i dunno why that isn't allowed
2012-03-21T12:35:27  <delt0r> that is what i don't like
2012-03-21T12:35:32  <antimatroid> i would be in favour of allowing anyway to partake in hft
2012-03-21T12:35:36  <antimatroid> anyone*
2012-03-21T12:35:46  <mcstar> no point
2012-03-21T12:35:50  <delt0r> if its a "good" thing then its not a special privilege
2012-03-21T12:35:51  <mcstar> if speed is the leverage
2012-03-21T12:36:51  <delt0r> but it is a special privilege... and liquidity arguments are BS too, since we don't need to measure that in millionths of a second
2012-03-21T12:37:26  <antimatroid> how is it any different than normal trading?
2012-03-21T12:38:04  <antimatroid> if i can i want to work at optiver
2012-03-21T12:38:08  <antimatroid> they have a nice dress code
2012-03-21T12:38:08  <delt0r> antimatroid: because i am not allowed to do it. Normal brokerage accounts don't work like a hft one does
2012-03-21T12:38:14  <antimatroid> i'm not kidding either, i care that much about dress code
2012-03-21T12:38:46  <antimatroid> yes, but that's an issue with the current laws
2012-03-21T12:38:48  <antimatroid> not hft itself
2012-03-21T12:39:00  <antimatroid> or algo trading
2012-03-21T12:39:08  <delt0r> its a problem with a lot of the current finance sector
2012-03-21T12:39:14  <antimatroid> personally i'd be more interested in playing with the strategic aspects rather than minimising speed
2012-03-21T12:39:18  <delt0r> special privileges
2012-03-21T12:39:37  <delt0r> even for things like short selling
2012-03-21T12:40:16  <delt0r> hell even the current banking system... banks other than the central bank have special privileges
2012-03-21T12:40:27  <delt0r> they shouldn't
2012-03-21T12:41:07  <antimatroid> yeah, but the issue here is with the regulations and not the banks
2012-03-21T12:41:11  <delt0r> antimatroid: I dont have a direct problem with hft other than the potential to really make a market volatile in principal
2012-03-21T12:41:37  <antimatroid> hate the game, not the player as they say :P
2012-03-21T12:42:01  <delt0r> but currently it is just a crony thing... like i said in the US they even rolled back a whole bunch of trades when i cost one of these groups a lot of cash
2012-03-21T12:42:39  <antimatroid> yeah i don't doubt some aspects of it are shady
2012-03-21T12:43:13  <delt0r> I also have a hard time believing that you get any real benefit with less than 1 sec liquidity
2012-03-21T12:43:41  <delt0r> the less spread argument is BS since that is where a HFT tries to win... other traders don't see that
2012-03-21T12:44:22  <mcstar> delt0r: pls enlighten me, if all these hft firms are profitable, where comes that money? usual stocks?
2012-03-21T12:45:57  <delt0r> mcstar: in speculative trading -aka the share market. It is zero sum. So someone else losses money if someone makes money..
2012-03-21T12:46:19  <delt0r> this is of course not true for stocks with dividends
2012-03-21T12:46:28  <delt0r> but that is pretty rare these days
2012-03-21T12:46:47  <antimatroid> if you don't pay dividends wouldn't that just increase the value of the company and hence it's stock price?
2012-03-21T12:46:53  <antimatroid> its*

2012-03-21T12:47:31  <delt0r> either way stock trading in this case *is* zero sum
2012-03-21T12:47:33  <antimatroid> well, background plan
2012-03-21T12:47:42  <antimatroid> how is this case different?
2012-03-21T12:47:44  <mcstar> delt0r: i dotn think you get my question, im interested where that exact money comes from, which these firms profit, whose loss is that?
2012-03-21T12:48:00  <delt0r> mcstar: other traders
2012-03-21T12:48:08  <mcstar> exactly like them?
2012-03-21T12:48:11  <antimatroid> if hft is zero sum isn't every other aspect of trading?
2012-03-21T12:48:24  <delt0r> mcstar: mostly from the plain old traders... say like me
2012-03-21T12:48:41  <mcstar> delt0r: so hft is not closed over profit/loss lol
2012-03-21T12:48:41  <antimatroid> and if people want to willingly partake in a zero sum game with each other, i don't see the problem, it's like betting
2012-03-21T12:48:43  <mcstar> ok
2012-03-21T12:48:58  <delt0r> antimatroid: on stock markets over short term... long term (years) economies are not zero sum
2012-03-21T12:49:14  <antimatroid> so you don't like anyone trading short term?
2012-03-21T12:49:16  <antimatroid> :P
2012-03-21T12:49:26  <delt0r> but yes... other trading is zero sum if the sole idea is that you can sell for more later
2012-03-21T12:49:34  <delt0r> rather than it has utility
2012-03-21T12:49:42  <delt0r> antimatroid: no
2012-03-21T12:49:58  <delt0r> but HFT is not making more money than any other form of speculative trading
2012-03-21T12:50:11  <delt0r> it doesn;t incresse the GDP
2012-03-21T12:50:24  <delt0r> its not productivity
2012-03-21T12:50:47  <mcstar> i dont get that either
2012-03-21T12:51:10  <mcstar> i mean a country can only increase its GDP at the loss of others' right?
2012-03-21T12:51:18  <delt0r> speculative trading just moves money around... from one set of traders to the other set
2012-03-21T12:51:30  <delt0r> mcstar: no that is not what i said
2012-03-21T12:51:37  <mcstar> delt0r: i am asking
2012-03-21T12:51:44  <delt0r> a full economy is not zero su,
2012-03-21T12:51:45  <delt0r> sum
2012-03-21T12:51:58  <delt0r> aka dig gold out of the ground
2012-03-21T12:52:05  <delt0r> milk a cow
2012-03-21T12:52:10  <mcstar> and that gold can be many things
2012-03-21T12:52:22  <antimatroid> gains to trade etc.
2012-03-21T12:52:25  <delt0r> either way it is not zero sum at that point

2012-03-21T12:53:02  <mcstar> i still dont see how can pour true value into an economy other than natural resources
2012-03-21T12:53:19  <mcstar> can sy*

2012-03-21T12:53:55  <antimatroid> you can increase how efficiently you use those natural resources i guess
2012-03-21T12:54:04  <delt0r> its why Aussie is don't so well. F ton of mining

2012-03-21T12:54:18  <antimatroid> it's basically akin to why you don't produce everything you consume for yourself
2012-03-21T12:54:32  <antimatroid> starting with opportunity cost
2012-03-21T12:55:15  <mcstar> fucking time
2012-03-21T12:55:21  <delt0r> when i talk about zero sum, i am talking about speculative markets in particular.
2012-03-21T12:55:26  <antimatroid> also gdp is a fairly rough way to look at output or whatever
2012-03-21T12:55:38  <antimatroid> if you blow a city up and rebuild it gdp rises

2012-03-21T14:23:34  <Zannick> in the long run, we probably want to have the org not relying on jeff being around

2012-03-21T14:24:13  <delt0r> indeed
2012-03-21T14:24:20  <Zannick> as for doing more rewrites...
2012-03-21T14:24:54  <Zannick> getting a contest going while other people work on rewrites was the plan for ants
2012-03-21T14:25:00  <Zannick> that fell apart pretty fast
2012-03-21T14:25:32  <mleise> There was not enough man power to do both
2012-03-21T14:25:52  <mleise> Or at least the motivation to work on Zeta seemed rather low ;)
2012-03-21T14:26:50  <Zannick> it was myself and jbroman for a bit, then we got sidetracked with non-aichallenge things
2012-03-21T14:26:53  <Zannick> :)
2012-03-21T14:27:08  <mleise> What do you think about the idea to move to New Zealand or other country where the laws on organizations are lax?
2012-03-21T14:27:31  <Zannick> we'd probably need a representative there, wouldn't we?

2012-03-21T14:29:23  <mleise> On the other hand, it could be an organization in a different country every year :D, like soccer

2012-03-21T14:30:00  <delt0r> I am from NZ
2012-03-21T14:30:13  <delt0r> I may end up back there this year yet
2012-03-21T14:30:14  <mleise> ah, now i get it
2012-03-21T14:30:38  <Zannick> personally i would prefer we not need to handle any money at all ;)
2012-03-21T14:30:44  <Zannick> but that is pretty tough
2012-03-21T14:30:53  <delt0r> Also i was involved with a few clubs--so i am familiar with the requirements
2012-03-21T14:31:04  <Zannick> since we need so many cpus
2012-03-21T14:31:27  <delt0r> Zannick: People want to donate. And yea, cpu time is hard to get without cash
2012-03-21T14:31:36  <mleise> Yeah, we have grown quite a bit. Look at Wikipedia to see where this ends: millions of donations
2012-03-21T14:31:49  <mleise> ...hopefully
2012-03-21T14:32:18  <delt0r> sorry going to the pub
2012-03-21T14:32:19  <Zannick> people want to donate because we frequently don't have enough cpu
2012-03-21T14:32:19  <delt0r> later
2012-03-21T14:32:45  <mleise> fortunately if the servers run slowly, some people come up and want to donate servers
2012-03-21T14:33:03  <mleise> Zannick: yeah, that
2012-03-21T14:33:41  <mleise> Can we run the contest on distributed computers like SETI?
2012-03-21T14:33:54  <Zannick> we very much should not
2012-03-21T14:34:41  <mleise> yeah people will look at the source code :(
2012-03-21T14:35:04  <Zannick> aside from the security issues associated with running arbitrary code on people's computers, we kind of rely on having a mostly level processing field
2012-03-21T14:35:59  <mleise> It could work if our contest was entirely different and ran psudo-code in a virtual machine or something
2012-03-21T14:36:04  <Zannick> seti has neither of those problems because the org itself writes the code, and the goal is simply computation, not purely level computation
2012-03-21T14:36:52  <Zannick> we do run in a virtual machine, actually
2012-03-21T14:37:14  <mleise> oh the sandbox?
2012-03-21T14:37:33  <Zannick> yeah
2012-03-21T14:38:53  <mleise> theoretically, with a profiler you could track the CPU time, right?
2012-03-21T14:39:38  <mleise> and you get the CPU clock speed from somewhere else and then you have a ballpark figure :)
2012-03-21T14:41:10  <Zannick> i think it would be awesome if we had a cluster of gpus to run on
2012-03-21T14:41:10  <mleise> and if the sandbox files were inaccessible from the host system, the source code would be protected from access
2012-03-21T14:41:36  <Zannick> that's a pretty big if
2012-03-21T14:42:17  <mleise> :( GPUs is also a pretty big if, with all the compilers producing X86 code
2012-03-21T14:42:44  <mleise> Other than C code? Is there anything that compiles to GPU instructions?
2012-03-21T14:43:19  <Zannick> i don't actually know
2012-03-21T14:43:30  <Zannick> it is just one of those absurd awesome dreams to have
2012-03-21T14:44:08  <mleise> Sure, but GPUs - while good at parallelization - may not be flexible enough to keep up with CPUs on arbitrary code
2012-03-21T14:45:07  <mleise> also I think you have to paralellize *inside* one program, not several programs. ultimately the code becomes something like a pixel shader
2012-03-21T14:46:42  <mleise> I was quite seriously thinking about running the contest on everbodys PCs. If we started from scratch and didn't want to take any money in the hand, we would probably discuss this.
2012-03-21T14:48:02  <Zannick> my answer is no.
2012-03-21T14:48:15  <Zannick> a) sandboxing multiple architectures.
2012-03-21T14:49:14  <Zannick> b) running other people's unvetted code on other people's machines. even with their permission, that is really scary.
2012-03-21T14:49:31  <mleise> - inside a sandbox VM right?
2012-03-21T14:49:45  * Zannick points back to a
2012-03-21T14:49:57  <mleise> so there really is only a)
2012-03-21T14:50:05  <Zannick> now we have to support multiple sandboxes, and they have to be airtight
2012-03-21T14:50:22  <mleise> like ... Google Native Client
2012-03-21T14:50:41  <Zannick> c) even if we only pass binary blobs, people can still grab those and essentially copy code
2012-03-21T14:50:51  <Zannick> we do not have the developer resources NaCl has

2012-03-21T14:52:01  <Zannick> theory and practice are two very different things
2012-03-21T14:52:05  <mleise> c): The VM downloads encrypted files
2012-03-21T14:52:12  <Zannick> and runs what?
2012-03-21T14:52:24  <mleise> and those are never stored on disk, but in a RAM file system inside the VM
2012-03-21T14:52:29  <Zannick> and knows how to decrypt what?
2012-03-21T14:52:34  <Zannick> with what? *
2012-03-21T14:52:46  <mleise> right, knows how to decrypt the files to .py, .exe ...
2012-03-21T14:53:29  <Zannick> assume a very savvy person with access to all data the VM processes
2012-03-21T14:53:50  <Zannick> oh
2012-03-21T14:54:42  <Zannick> d) since we like to open source everything, someone could take the information sent to the machine we assume is running the VM, have full access to whatever we send, encrypted or not, and forge their own results
2012-03-21T14:55:42  <Zannick> even if we don't open source it, that's still possible
2012-03-21T14:55:44  <mleise> ok, I give up. I would need to be a network security expert to counter that compelling argument, if there was a counter argument
2012-03-21T14:55:45  <Zannick> maybe a little harder
2012-03-21T14:56:17  <Zannick> i know there are mechanisms to determine trustability of a computer
2012-03-21T14:56:42  <Zannick> but that would be really difficult with the amount of players we have
2012-03-21T14:57:08  <Zannick> because they could implement a fully working version that only forges when they're in the game
2012-03-21T14:57:31  <mleise> For 1 on 1 TCP matches I think both players could run a server and validate each others game states.
2012-03-21T14:59:04  <Zannick> tcp servers have a server running the game, and the clients send it moves
2012-03-21T14:59:58  <mleise> I know, that was just an idea for when people want to just play each other or when TCP servers are down
2012-03-21T15:00:15  <mleise> a peer-to-peer connection
2012-03-21T15:00:15  <Zannick> there's no worry about forged results since everyone runs only their code
2012-03-21T15:00:25  <Zannick> ah, p2p aichallenge
2012-03-21T15:00:28  <Zannick> that would be interesting
2012-03-21T15:01:11  <mleise> you know... just keep em busy while the few server capacities run the real contest

2012-03-21T15:02:02  <mleise> Maybe people care less about slow ranking updates, when they have several other options to test their bots

2012-03-21T15:03:04  <Zannick> i like the idea of p2p games
2012-03-21T15:03:06  <mleise> P2P could have the negative effect of splitting up the contest into little groups though.
2012-03-21T15:03:25  <Zannick> ranks/scores would still require a central authority
2012-03-21T15:03:26  <mleise> but I'm with you on that
2012-03-21T15:04:52  <mleise> with the TCP servers it is impossible to choose your opponent and get comparable results on each run

2012-03-21T15:06:46  <mleise> A little chat window could also help. So you can tell your peer, when you change the bot's code.

2012-03-21T15:07:53  <mleise> And you could always do something like: "Let's compare our bots from 2 contests ago." No infrastructure needed
2012-03-21T15:09:35  <mleise> Especially Accoun keeps asking for some means to still play Ants against others

2012-03-21T15:15:32  <mleise> (I don't have a flat screen, I can still call it a tube)
2012-03-21T15:17:09  <pairofdice> Should fetch a good price in the antiquariat
