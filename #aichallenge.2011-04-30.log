2011-04-30T00:03:01  <jaycobcoleman> Well I understand perfectly 'how' to do it, but yes I understand what you mean. I'll tell you what though, I'm gonna do it anyway, just because so far I've never really dealt with files from python, only in bash, so I'll learn some things in the process of it
2011-04-30T00:03:19  *** sids_aquarius <sids_aquarius!~sidi09@117.211.88.42> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-30T00:03:28  <jaycobcoleman> I do understand though that it won't be used by other people and in fact I won't even likely use it
2011-04-30T00:03:38  <jaycobcoleman> just for the sake of my education
2011-04-30T00:04:43  <antimatroid> dealing with files in c++ is nice
2011-04-30T00:04:51  <antimatroid> just use ifstreams
2011-04-30T00:05:07  <jaycobcoleman> from what I've seen python has been quite nice
2011-04-30T00:05:27  <jaycobcoleman> but yes, ifstreams are nice
2011-04-30T00:05:50  <antimatroid> i wish c++ had a type system like haskell
2011-04-30T00:06:15  <antimatroid> and treated functions like variables, and had operator precedence overloading (and any operators for that matter)
2011-04-30T00:06:20  <antimatroid> then c++ would be almost perfect for me
2011-04-30T00:07:34  <jaycobcoleman> The reason I wanted to experiment with this was because of situations like when you want to run a local game and you need a map with a certain number of bots to test or wanted to test on a particular map or with particular bots
2011-04-30T00:07:53  <jaycobcoleman> I basically wanted to be able to put in what I cared about and have the rest filled in
2011-04-30T00:08:04  <jaycobcoleman> or find the best match for that input
2011-04-30T00:17:25  <jaycobcoleman> so we have a whole bunch of 4 or 5 player maps, 2 or 3 for each of 7, 8, and 10, and then none of anything else
2011-04-30T00:17:36  <jaycobcoleman> is there a reason for that odd distribution?
2011-04-30T00:17:48  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: this would be directed at you
2011-04-30T00:22:49  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: i imagine a lower number of players is more likely to arise
2011-04-30T00:23:05  <antimatroid> i'm not against that happening, but we can tweak the map generator later if necessary
2011-04-30T00:23:15  <antimatroid> look at the map generator too
2011-04-30T00:23:23  <antimatroid> i may have capped maxPlayers at 10
2011-04-30T00:23:46  <jaycobcoleman> It looks as though you might've :/ I'll take a look
2011-04-30T00:23:57  <antimatroid> they are just sample maps
2011-04-30T00:24:06  <antimatroid> there will be a LOT generator for the server
2011-04-30T00:24:19  <jaycobcoleman> yeah I know, and yes, 4-10
2011-04-30T00:25:17  <jaycobcoleman> Will new maps be generated specific for each map or are we just going to have a large database to use?
2011-04-30T00:25:25  <jaycobcoleman> *match
2011-04-30T00:28:59  <antimatroid> i'm in favour of a new map every game
2011-04-30T00:29:03  <antimatroid> but not sure that'll happen
2011-04-30T00:29:25  <amstan> imho the map gen should have been included in the game engine
2011-04-30T00:29:26  <jaycobcoleman> why is that? lack of trust in the generator?
2011-04-30T00:29:38  <amstan> that way it's easy make the map generator dynamic enough
2011-04-30T00:29:46  <jaycobcoleman> it isn't too late
2011-04-30T00:29:52  <antimatroid> amstan: the map generator is written like a class
2011-04-30T00:29:56  <jaycobcoleman> well, maybe
2011-04-30T00:29:58  <antimatroid> you can just include it in the engine
2011-04-30T00:30:03  <jaycobcoleman> hoho?
2011-04-30T00:30:04  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, except food depends on the map type
2011-04-30T00:30:22  <antimatroid> yes, we're planning to have the map type as a parameter in maps
2011-04-30T00:30:32  <antimatroid> then the engine can use that information to select the food spawning method
2011-04-30T00:31:15  <amstan> but if you had the map gen built in the engine, you wouldn't have to worry about map formats or parameters for maps for that matter
2011-04-30T00:32:11  <amstan> @seen mcleopold

2011-04-30T00:33:28  <amstan> antimatroid: how completed is the engine? do we have anything left in that regard?
2011-04-30T00:34:42  <antimatroid> amstan: i think it's all good except reading the symmetry type
2011-04-30T00:34:57  <antimatroid> sigh_ would be better to ask
2011-04-30T00:35:48  <sigh_> engine is fine, unless the specs change :P

2011-04-30T00:37:36  <sigh_> i haven't been following the progress much either
2011-04-30T00:37:52  <antimatroid> i want mcstar's script
2011-04-30T00:37:53  <amstan> janzert: how's the sandbox state?
2011-04-30T00:37:58  <amstan> antimatroid: script?
2011-04-30T00:38:14  <antimatroid> (13:20:34) mcstar: i wrote a bash script so that the visualizer can be used conveniently
2011-04-30T00:38:15  <antimatroid> (13:20:42) mcstar: no copy-paste
2011-04-30T00:38:15  <antimatroid> (13:21:11) mcstar: u just have to give it the replay filename
2011-04-30T00:38:36  <amstan> antimatroid: it's not that hard.. the php file already does this
2011-04-30T00:38:45  <jaycobcoleman> I have one possible but not likely issue with the engine
2011-04-30T00:38:52  <sigh_> um... just use visualizer/visualize_locally.py
2011-04-30T00:38:55  <antimatroid> then why aren't we just giving people that?
2011-04-30T00:39:01  <amstan> yes.. or what sigh said
2011-04-30T00:39:15  <jaycobcoleman> the get_perspective and get_map_output functions are designed in such a way that perspective and map output can be found from the point of view of a specific player
2011-04-30T00:39:37  <antimatroid> perhaps the local visualizer could have a "reload" button
2011-04-30T00:39:44  <jaycobcoleman> McLeopold and I discussed a change that could cause problems if those functions were used in that manner
2011-04-30T00:39:49  <antimatroid> so you don't have to keep refreshing the page to get the new game?
2011-04-30T00:40:04  <sigh_> jaycobcoleman: what change?
2011-04-30T00:40:38  <jaycobcoleman> Displaying UNSEEN_FOOD on the map for food the player has seen, has not yet received an 'r' line, and is not currently visible
2011-04-30T00:40:42  <amstan> sigh_: do you know how to setup the pipeline for the manager part?
2011-04-30T00:40:50  <amstan> sigh_: the cron scripts i mean
2011-04-30T00:40:55  <sigh_> amstan: no...
2011-04-30T00:41:00  <amstan> sigh..
2011-04-30T00:41:10  <sigh_> :(
2011-04-30T00:41:32  <antimatroid> what?
2011-04-30T00:41:37  <sigh_> jaycobcoleman: that seem really bad
2011-04-30T00:41:43  <jaycobcoleman> what does?
2011-04-30T00:41:52  <sigh_> displaying unseen food
2011-04-30T00:41:54  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mcleopold Do you have time on sunday to code on the contest? I'm very eager to start the beta test server.
2011-04-30T00:41:54  <contestbot> amstan: Yes master!
2011-04-30T00:42:06  <jaycobcoleman> why is that?
2011-04-30T00:42:08  <antimatroid> yeah, the idea of a fog of war is that you don't have information except for squares you can see
2011-04-30T00:42:13  <sigh_> that is information that is not guarenteed to be accurate
2011-04-30T00:42:19  * amstan signs off
2011-04-30T00:42:26  <jaycobcoleman> yes which is why it's made distinct from food
2011-04-30T00:42:30  <antimatroid> actually, i understand why they want to do it
2011-04-30T00:42:41  <antimatroid> but then you make it hard for people to ignore not visible food
2011-04-30T00:42:48  <jaycobcoleman> we now have 3 food functions
2011-04-30T00:42:49  <antimatroid> i'm with sigh_, bad idea
2011-04-30T00:42:50  <jaycobcoleman> food()
2011-04-30T00:42:57  <sigh_> why are we adding all these things that should be part of the bot?
2011-04-30T00:43:01  <jaycobcoleman> food_unseen()
2011-04-30T00:43:07  <jaycobcoleman> and food_visible(
2011-04-30T00:43:14  <jaycobcoleman> they are a part of the bot

2011-04-30T00:48:14  <antimatroid> they want it to be easy to give a vector of food locations yeah?
2011-04-30T00:48:28  <sigh_> so implement that in the bot
2011-04-30T00:48:30  <jaycobcoleman> I don't want anything. A change was made that doesn't cause any problems for the engine unless we decide that we for some reason want to display the map from a particular player's perspective, which we don't currently do, but have the framework to do
2011-04-30T00:48:32  <antimatroid> it would be more complicated to implement
2011-04-30T00:49:11  <jaycobcoleman> what more complicated than what?
2011-04-30T00:49:12  <antimatroid> i still argue my 'r' line is justified, information about visible squares "state" should not be implicit
2011-04-30T00:49:17  <sigh_> why can't you display the map from a particular player's perspective?
2011-04-30T00:49:21  <antimatroid> nevermind what i said about that
2011-04-30T00:50:08  <sigh_> antimatroid: imo, the entire thing could have been side-stepped by passing the state as a character-array
2011-04-30T00:50:09  <jaycobcoleman> sigh_: we'd have to make a bunch of changes to the engine to incorporate UNSEEN_FOOD if we wanted to do that
2011-04-30T00:50:27  <jaycobcoleman> but there's absolutely no reason to at the moment
2011-04-30T00:50:35  <sigh_> why do you need unseen food?
2011-04-30T00:50:41  <antimatroid> sigh_: i fought for the character array and lost
2011-04-30T00:51:17  <jaycobcoleman> It was just something implemented to go along with 'r' lines
2011-04-30T00:51:25  <sigh_> why?
2011-04-30T00:51:37  <jaycobcoleman> because if we're going to remember them in lists we might as well remember them on the map
2011-04-30T00:51:49  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: you are then potentially giving false information to bots
2011-04-30T00:51:55  <sigh_> so why can't the bots do that?
2011-04-30T00:52:08  <sigh_> and yes, now you are passing heuristic information
2011-04-30T00:52:11  <jaycobcoleman> sigh_: the bots do
2011-04-30T00:52:21  <jaycobcoleman> and false information how?
2011-04-30T00:52:23  <sigh_> so then why does the engine need to tell them>
2011-04-30T00:52:24  <sigh_> ?
2011-04-30T00:52:29  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: it isn't
2011-04-30T00:52:35  <antimatroid> because the square may not currently contain food
2011-04-30T00:52:37  <sigh_> what isn't?
2011-04-30T00:52:44  <jaycobcoleman> that's what I meant when I said I don't think you understand
2011-04-30T00:52:57  <antimatroid> atm information is only passed for a visible square
2011-04-30T00:52:58  <sigh_> you are not being very clear
2011-04-30T00:53:05  <sigh_> does this require an engine change or not?
2011-04-30T00:53:09  <antimatroid> it also makes explaining stuff in the specs more complicated
2011-04-30T00:53:18  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: UNSEEN_FOOD will not overwrite any new information and should clearly be prioritized beneath seen food
2011-04-30T00:53:39  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: no
2011-04-30T00:53:51  <antimatroid> i'm as confused as sigh now
2011-04-30T00:53:59  <jaycobcoleman> not unless you want to display perspective from a player
2011-04-30T00:54:02  <jaycobcoleman> we don't do that
2011-04-30T00:54:14  <jaycobcoleman> but the function get_perspective is setup so that we can
2011-04-30T00:54:25  <sigh_> ok, you are being extremely unclear
2011-04-30T00:54:39  <antimatroid> start over
2011-04-30T00:54:41  <jaycobcoleman> haha, it's hard to address all these things so quickly
2011-04-30T00:55:09  <jaycobcoleman> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/pull/92/files
2011-04-30T00:55:17  <jaycobcoleman> that's the change
2011-04-30T00:55:32  <jaycobcoleman> I talked about it with McLeopold and we decided it would be sompler
2011-04-30T00:55:36  <jaycobcoleman> *simpler
2011-04-30T00:55:54  <sigh_> simpler than what?
2011-04-30T00:56:16  <jaycobcoleman> 'r' lines mean that a player is now remembering all food, which can lead to them not distinguishing between them
2011-04-30T00:56:24  <sigh_> jaycobcoleman: don't say things that rely on so much implicit context
2011-04-30T00:56:46  <sigh_> *shrug* I don't understand
2011-04-30T00:56:49  <jaycobcoleman> food that possibly isn't there will be weighted as heavily as visible food
2011-04-30T00:57:40  <jaycobcoleman> simpler from a programming stand-point than having to check each food_square to see if it is visible or not
2011-04-30T00:58:00  <jaycobcoleman> and simpler to make sure you're distinguishing between the two
2011-04-30T00:58:59  <sigh_> I give up, after all this I don't know what problem you are trying to solve, what this has to do with the engine, why you mentioned player perspectives
2011-04-30T00:59:08  <sigh_> or anything about it really
2011-04-30T00:59:54  <jaycobcoleman> are you aware of the get_perspective function?
2011-04-30T01:00:35  <jaycobcoleman> and get_map_output?
2011-04-30T01:01:32  <sigh_> ok... look
2011-04-30T01:02:00  <sigh_> when I read you question, I know what functions you are talking about, since I've worked on the engine
2011-04-30T01:02:15  <sigh_> but, I don't know if they are other functions in the code with the same name
2011-04-30T01:02:45  <sigh_> so I have to search the code and see if there are any other get_perspective functions in the code base
2011-04-30T01:03:15  <jaycobcoleman> ants.py
2011-04-30T01:03:21  <jaycobcoleman> this is what I'm referring to
2011-04-30T01:03:21  <sigh_> luckily there aren't so I can say that, yes, I know those functions, but there would be trouble if this was not the case
2011-04-30T01:03:31  <sigh_> you see why it's hard to follow what you are saying?
2011-04-30T01:03:40  <jaycobcoleman> absolutely
2011-04-30T01:03:45  <sigh_> yes, I know the functions
2011-04-30T01:03:57  <jaycobcoleman> here it is in one sentence:
2011-04-30T01:04:14  <jaycobcoleman> get_map_output combines all the data from each player perspective. If player_perspective were to have a use outside of this function, it would need to include unseen food, which is the only data type we would want displayed in get_map_output as it is ultimately used for replay data
2011-04-30T01:04:16  <jaycobcoleman> or two
2011-04-30T01:05:12  <jaycobcoleman> get_perspective has potential for other uses, I'm just asserting that with this change it can't be adapted without giving us bad replay information
2011-04-30T01:05:13  <sigh_> why would it need to include unseen_food
2011-04-30T01:06:26  <sigh_> what other uses?
2011-04-30T01:06:50  <jaycobcoleman> I don't know why it would. really this issue has been blown way out of proportion as it's more of a cautionary statement that get_perspective or get_map_output should not be used outside getting information for replays
2011-04-30T01:07:20  <jaycobcoleman> say somebody wanted to review what their own bots saw
2011-04-30T01:07:38  <jaycobcoleman> altering those functions as you appear to be able to do would give you bad replay information
2011-04-30T01:07:44  <sigh_> see... now I don't know what you are talking about again
2011-04-30T01:07:50  <sigh_> you are leaving sooooo much out
2011-04-30T01:08:02  <jaycobcoleman> haha here
2011-04-30T01:08:04  <jaycobcoleman> how about this
2011-04-30T01:08:20  <jaycobcoleman> remove the player parameter from get_map_output
2011-04-30T01:08:56  <jaycobcoleman> that'll end my worries
2011-04-30T01:09:14  <sigh_> how will that help?
2011-04-30T01:09:56  <sigh_> get_map_output is never used with the player parameter

2011-04-30T01:10:05  <jaycobcoleman> McLeopold seemed pro implementing UNSEEN_FOOD in the starters
2011-04-30T01:10:29  <sigh_> what's that got to do with the engine?
2011-04-30T01:11:06  <jaycobcoleman> so getting map output from a player's perspective won't reflect what they really see because the engine doesn't currently handle UNSEEN_FOOD
2011-04-30T01:11:30  <jaycobcoleman> remove the player parameter because it isn't used and won't be accurate if that change is made
2011-04-30T01:11:40  <sigh_> ...
2011-04-30T01:11:56  <sigh_> I don't know if you are talking about the engine or the bot
2011-04-30T01:12:01  <jaycobcoleman> engine
2011-04-30T01:12:16  <jaycobcoleman> it's basically getting rid of temptation
2011-04-30T01:12:29  <sigh_> removing the player parameter will not make a single bit of difference to the engine
2011-04-30T01:12:58  <sigh_> but how will removing it help the bot?
2011-04-30T01:13:41  <sigh_> whatever bot wants to do should have NOTHING to do with the engine
2011-04-30T01:13:54  <sigh_> the bot has all the information it needs to about the game
2011-04-30T01:14:05  <jaycobcoleman> It will have no effect on the engine or the bot, it'll have the effect of ensuring that people working on the engine do not use it to render info from a player's perspective
2011-04-30T01:14:15  <jaycobcoleman> it's a useless parameter
2011-04-30T01:14:25  <jaycobcoleman> I want to make sure nobody tries to use it
2011-04-30T01:14:29  <jaycobcoleman> it would be bad
2011-04-30T01:14:36  <jaycobcoleman> that's all
2011-04-30T01:15:29  <jaycobcoleman> get_map_output should only be used without parameters for replay data. The structure of the function should reflect this so that people know this is its purpose and only purpose
2011-04-30T01:15:30  <antimatroid> wait hang on, don't remove the player parameter before the scores
2011-04-30T01:15:39  <antimatroid> if you're not talking about that, carry on
2011-04-30T01:15:51  <jaycobcoleman> nope :)
2011-04-30T01:16:34  <sigh_> *shrug* I don't really see the problem, if get_map_output is called with a player, then it correctly renders what the map looks like from their perspective
2011-04-30T01:16:44  <jaycobcoleman> yes, for now
2011-04-30T01:16:54  <jaycobcoleman> it won't if UNSEEN_FOOD is implemented
2011-04-30T01:17:26  <jaycobcoleman> You see? that's the only potential issue :/
2011-04-30T01:17:30  <sigh_> you said unseed food was implemented in the starter bot
2011-04-30T01:18:18  <jaycobcoleman> yup, but if it's implemented in the starter bot and not in the engine then the engine will think the bot sees one thing, when the bot is actually seeing that in addition to UNSEEN_FOOD
2011-04-30T01:18:32  <sigh_> that's not the engine's problem
2011-04-30T01:19:10  <jaycobcoleman> agreed!
2011-04-30T01:19:24  <jaycobcoleman> I hope you understand that I'm just replying to everything you say
2011-04-30T01:19:31  <jaycobcoleman> this was never a big issue
2011-04-30T01:19:35  <sigh_> heh
2011-04-30T01:19:39  <jaycobcoleman> or really an issue at all
2011-04-30T01:19:46  <jaycobcoleman> which I said from the beginning
2011-04-30T01:20:00  <sigh_> on the other hand, putting unseen food in the starter pack has the potential to confuse people
2011-04-30T01:20:22  <sigh_> but I'll let you guys deal with that

2011-04-30T01:23:32  <jaycobcoleman> That was a fun conversation. Why might unseen food be confusing?
2011-04-30T01:24:25  <sigh_> because it's a heuristic... the food might not actually be there
2011-04-30T01:25:55  <jaycobcoleman> if we didn't add unseen food, then most people would likely consider it on the same level as visible food, because they're both a part of the food function
2011-04-30T01:26:06  <jaycobcoleman> which would be much worse
2011-04-30T01:26:42  <jaycobcoleman> a person can choose to ignore the heuristic altogether by using only food_visible()
2011-04-30T01:27:23  <sigh_> fair enough... the other option is to just not care about unseen food in the starter
2011-04-30T01:28:12  *** davidd <davidd!davidd@tinkywinky.stack.nl> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2011-04-30T01:28:16  <jaycobcoleman> well that's the negative result of 'r' lines. They encourage people to track both seen and unseen food, and unless we make it part of the starter they most likely won't make a distinction
2011-04-30T01:28:50  <a1k0n> unseen food?  like, have the engine tell the players how much food is out there that they can't see?
2011-04-30T01:28:52  <sigh_> 'r' lines don't force people to track food anymore than 'd' lines force them to track ants
2011-04-30T01:29:15  <jaycobcoleman> a1k0n: have them remember food they have seen, but isn't visible
2011-04-30T01:29:17  <sigh_> a1k0n: no, just a heuristic for bots to remember food they've seen
2011-04-30T01:29:29  <a1k0n> oh.  that's up to the bot then.
2011-04-30T01:29:36  <a1k0n> so this is a starter pack thing.
2011-04-30T01:29:40  <jaycobcoleman> yes
2011-04-30T01:29:44  <a1k0n> i c.
2011-04-30T01:30:00  <sigh_> you can name it something more clear like maybe_food() to imply that it is a heuristic
2011-04-30T01:30:07  <a1k0n> i am in favor of not caring about unseen food in the starter
2011-04-30T01:30:12  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: I'm all for that
2011-04-30T01:30:31  * sigh_ agrees with a1k0n
2011-04-30T01:30:57  <jaycobcoleman> what are you suggesting, just ignoring 'r' lines altogether?
2011-04-30T01:31:19  <jaycobcoleman> and resetting food_lists every turn
2011-04-30T01:31:22  <jaycobcoleman> ?
2011-04-30T01:31:26  <sigh_> I don't see why that's a problem
2011-04-30T01:31:29  <a1k0n> i am clearly not up to date on that.  the engine tells you about food you can't see?
2011-04-30T01:31:39  <sigh_> a1k0n: no it doesn't
2011-04-30T01:32:04  <a1k0n> so, no, then just use the information on the 'r' lines, and pretend no other food exists.  this bot isn't supposed to be *good* is it?
2011-04-30T01:32:35  <sigh_> ah... 'f' is for food... 'r' is more complicated
2011-04-30T01:32:41  <a1k0n> oh
2011-04-30T01:32:43  <a1k0n> r row col                            # previously seen food no longer at location
2011-04-30T01:32:44  <sigh_> I don't like it too much, because it is annoying to explain :P
2011-04-30T01:32:53  <a1k0n> that means someone took the food
2011-04-30T01:32:56  <jaycobcoleman> if we don't deal with 'r' lines in the starter then it'll be a huge pain for people to figure out how themselves
2011-04-30T01:33:19  <a1k0n> wait a sec, so you know when someone else eats food you saw previously but can't necessarily see now?
2011-04-30T01:33:19  <sigh_> jaycobcoleman: the point is they don't need to!
2011-04-30T01:33:38  <jaycobcoleman> many will want to, and they'll have no example to follow
2011-04-30T01:33:43  <sigh_> jaycobcoleman: 'r' doesn't tell them anything they could not have figured out by remembering state
2011-04-30T01:33:44  <a1k0n> plus you get the same 'f' squares each frame if none of your ants move, right?

2011-04-30T01:34:53  <jaycobcoleman> a1k0n: what documentation are you looking at?
2011-04-30T01:35:13  <a1k0n> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification and https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ant-bot-input-output
2011-04-30T01:35:15  <jaycobcoleman> I believe they're mentioned a couple different places
2011-04-30T01:35:33  <jaycobcoleman> okay input-output I think is pretty unclear
2011-04-30T01:35:34  <sigh> a1k0n: yeah, you can't really explain 'r' consisely
2011-04-30T01:35:56  <sigh> but it does not tell the bot anything that the bot couldn't figure out
2011-04-30T01:35:59  <jaycobcoleman> because the example doesn't really show 'r' lines
2011-04-30T01:36:12  <sigh> (part of the reason I don't like it too much)
2011-04-30T01:36:15  <a1k0n> that depends -- does the engine emit 'r' lines for food you saw previously, then moved away from and can no longer see, and then some other ant ate it?
2011-04-30T01:36:26  <a1k0n> cuz that's magical information you couldn't get elsewise
2011-04-30T01:36:32  <jaycobcoleman> no
2011-04-30T01:36:34  <sigh> a1k0n: only when that sqaure is visible again
2011-04-30T01:36:43  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i am the reason for the 'r' lines, my reasoning being that otherwise information about the "state" of a visible square was implicit in some cases
2011-04-30T01:36:56  <a1k0n> oh.  so it's basically the absense of 'f' lines for food you think should exist
2011-04-30T01:36:57  <antimatroid> and it was rather messy to calculate the information
2011-04-30T01:37:03  <sigh> a1k0n: right
2011-04-30T01:37:35  <sigh> I'm actually in favor or removing it given how annoying it was to explain
2011-04-30T01:37:35  <a1k0n> not really.  if you track state of a square, it would be invisible|food, and then when you observe it it would be visible|no food
2011-04-30T01:38:01  <a1k0n> no need for 'r' to tell you of the transition
2011-04-30T01:38:05  <antimatroid> except then you need to track what is old and new food information after processing input, then go through and delete food if it's old information

2011-04-30T01:38:38  <a1k0n> does the starter pack compute a visibility mask over the map?
2011-04-30T01:38:45  <sigh> it can, yes
2011-04-30T01:38:55  <antimatroid> no, it's making implicit information about the "state" of a visible square explicit
2011-04-30T01:39:44  *** sigh_ <sigh_!~sigh@210.18.207.102> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-30T01:40:17  <a1k0n> yeah.  so one approach is to have the visibility tracked by the engine and the client dumb and the server notifies about removal of food, or the client could be smarter and compute a visibility mask and then traverse it to update food states *iff* it really cares about food-removal transitions, and isn't just directing its ants to visible food every frame.
2011-04-30T01:40:47  <antimatroid> but how are you going to mark food information as old?
2011-04-30T01:40:54  <antimatroid> currently i  just have bool isFood
2011-04-30T01:40:59  <sigh_> that's the bot's problem
2011-04-30T01:41:31  <antimatroid> it's messy to handle and i don't like having implicit information about the state of a visible square
2011-04-30T01:41:41  <antimatroid> that's my argument, if people don't think that's important, then go and remove it :P
2011-04-30T01:41:43  <a1k0n> yeah, having the server figure that out is more trouble than it's worth
2011-04-30T01:41:56  <sigh_> it's not messy to handle, it's more messy to handle it in the server
2011-04-30T01:41:56  <sigh_> :P
2011-04-30T01:42:05  <jaycobcoleman> well it's all implemented already, and it's quite clean
2011-04-30T01:42:15  <sigh_> that's not the problem
2011-04-30T01:42:17  <a1k0n> well, any bot will pretty much have to know what it can see and what it can't, and that's defined implicitly by the position of the ants and the radii in the header
2011-04-30T01:42:22  <sigh_> the problem that it is a pain to explain
2011-04-30T01:42:33  <sigh_> look how long it took to tell a1k0n about it
2011-04-30T01:42:44  <antimatroid> you have to explain the implicit information otherwise
2011-04-30T01:42:53  <antimatroid> with this you can just say ignore it and don't change it

2011-04-30T01:42:59  <sigh_> antimatroid: that's easier to explain
2011-04-30T01:43:17  <sigh_> "you can't be sure about any food that you weren't told about this turn"
2011-04-30T01:43:32  <sigh_> anything further is the bot's responsibility
2011-04-30T01:44:06  <a1k0n> and if the starter packs implement visibility logic, then it's really easy to explain.
2011-04-30T01:44:07  <jaycobcoleman> explaining the purpose of the line itself becomes less important when we implement function as we have that do it for us i.e. food(), food_visible(), food_unseen()
2011-04-30T01:44:24  <jaycobcoleman> the purpose of the functions is to allow the bot creator to ignore the lines altogether
2011-04-30T01:44:35  <jaycobcoleman> and focus on their effect, which is very easy to understand
2011-04-30T01:45:46  <a1k0n> well, one could also consider, as a sort of reductio ad absurdam, having the server track which enemy ants were visible once and when the square the enemy ants were on becomes visible again, 'remove' the ants
2011-04-30T01:45:54  <sigh_> :)

2011-04-30T01:46:40  <sigh_> that doesn't tell me anything

2011-04-30T01:47:14  <antimatroid> 'r' = visible square that contained food the last time it was visible

2011-04-30T01:47:52  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: that doesn't explicitly state that the line is only sent if the food is no longer there

2011-04-30T01:54:06  <sigh_> still not complete
2011-04-30T01:54:12  <a1k0n> "also next frame, when it is still visible to you, will still not contain food unless there is an 'f'"
2011-04-30T01:54:21  <antimatroid> "visible square which doesn't contain food and did the last time it was visible"
2011-04-30T01:54:36  <sigh_> antimatroid: still not complete :P
2011-04-30T01:54:40  <sigh_> oh waut
2011-04-30T01:54:40  <a1k0n> hey what if food disappears and reappears in that same location
2011-04-30T01:54:41  <antimatroid> why not?
2011-04-30T01:54:42  <sigh_> yes it is
2011-04-30T01:54:48  <antimatroid> :p
2011-04-30T01:54:50  <a1k0n> do you get a 'r' and 'f' at the same time?
2011-04-30T01:54:50  <sigh_> a1k0n: you get an 'r' and an 'f'
2011-04-30T01:55:09  <a1k0n> does the engine really track that correctly?
2011-04-30T01:55:16  <sigh_> yes
2011-04-30T01:55:21  <antimatroid> sigh_ is my magical feature wizard
2011-04-30T01:55:24  <sigh_> we can change it if we need to
2011-04-30T01:55:29  <antimatroid> i come up with features and he implements them
2011-04-30T01:55:36  <antimatroid> :p
2011-04-30T01:55:38  <a1k0n> if it happens multiple times?  one 'r' and one 'f'?
2011-04-30T01:55:41  <sigh_> so technically, 'r' does give you a tiny bit of new info
2011-04-30T01:55:51  <sigh_> a1k0n: yes, because you only saw one 'r'
2011-04-30T01:56:26  <a1k0n> so on every square on the map you have a flag for "player N thinks there is food here"
2011-04-30T01:56:28  <sigh_> hmmm... that info leak is bad
2011-04-30T01:56:30  <antimatroid> it's explicitly telling you the outcome of a visible battle?
2011-04-30T01:56:31  <sigh_> need to fix
2011-04-30T01:56:36  <antimatroid> is that the difference you refer to?
2011-04-30T01:56:46  <antimatroid> and only if a food square spawned on a "dead" food square
2011-04-30T01:56:48  <a1k0n> it's just telling you an enemy ant ate it at some point
2011-04-30T01:57:07  <sigh_> yes, which tells you that there *are* enemy ants in that direction
2011-04-30T01:57:21  <a1k0n> but food spawning in that exact same location again is unlikely, no?
2011-04-30T01:57:29  <a1k0n> so you'd probably know it anyway from other nearby food squares
2011-04-30T01:57:37  <antimatroid> food can be waiting to spawn on a location :P
2011-04-30T01:57:44  <sigh_> a1k0n: yes, also the food locations are rotated
2011-04-30T01:57:51  <antimatroid> but if maps aren't flooded i don't expect it to be too much of a problem
2011-04-30T01:58:04  <sigh_> so, yes... overall this is a very minor problem
2011-04-30T01:58:18  <sigh_> I would rather get rid of the 'r' lnes
2011-04-30T01:58:38  <antimatroid> i will get over it

2011-04-30T01:59:14  <a1k0n> what implicit information?  the exact space of square you can/can't see?
2011-04-30T01:59:21  <antimatroid> he was in favour, otherwise it wouldn't have happened

2011-04-30T01:59:41  <antimatroid> visible squares are implicit information
2011-04-30T01:59:47  <a1k0n> well, the engine could draw you a huge map every frame
2011-04-30T01:59:55  <a1k0n> like in tron
2011-04-30T02:00:06  <antimatroid> we had that originally but mcleopold didn't like the size of input
2011-04-30T02:00:11  <sigh_> that's my perefered option :)
2011-04-30T02:00:22  <antimatroid> janzert and i preferred it too
2011-04-30T02:00:37  <a1k0n> so the input is compressed, and you have to reconstruct the input.  big whoop.
2011-04-30T02:00:48  <a1k0n> have the starter pack do it, and then everybody can do it without having to worry too much.
2011-04-30T02:01:17  <a1k0n> maybe even include a thing to print the map.
2011-04-30T02:01:46  <antimatroid> my c++ bot has << for state
2011-04-30T02:02:06  <antimatroid> they can also pass "state" information from an ifstream if they want

2011-04-30T03:39:41  <mcstar> its doesnt do anything for me
2011-04-30T03:39:50  <sigh_> if you pipe a replay into it, it will visualise it
2011-04-30T03:40:10  <mcstar> ah
2011-04-30T03:40:14  <sigh_> so something like: play_one_game.sh --stdout replay | python visualizer/visualize_locally.py

2011-04-30T03:41:20  <sigh_> no point running an extra process just to read the file :P
2011-04-30T03:41:22  <mcstar> my script embeds the given replay file in base64 in the html, and the opens the browser, and a js function decodes it
2011-04-30T03:41:58  <sigh_> sure, if that works better for your workflow, then use it
2011-04-30T03:42:06  <sigh_> just mentioning that the python script is already there :)
2011-04-30T03:42:25  <mcstar> i didnt know about thus vis_locally
2011-04-30T03:42:37  <mcstar> i talked to janzert
2011-04-30T03:42:48  <mcstar> and he said only copy-paste is possible

2011-04-30T03:43:29  <smiley1983> if an "r" and an "f" are issued for the same tile in one  turn, are the guaranteed to be in that order? Remove first, then add?
2011-04-30T03:43:38  <sigh_> I guess it should be documented somewhere
2011-04-30T03:43:44  <sigh_> smiley1983: no order guarentees
2011-04-30T03:44:15  <sigh_> in fact, at the moment r is always last
2011-04-30T03:44:43  <smiley1983> ... so the starter packs, if they respond to "r", should check for this case. I think I'll just remove "r" support in my starter pack: it creates too many ambiguities.
2011-04-30T03:44:58  <sigh_> yeah, I don't like 'r' in the first place
2011-04-30T03:45:29  <smiley1983> I'll write some comments about how to re-enable it. I think amstan will be annoyed about me issuing another pull request.
2011-04-30T03:45:32  <sigh_> it is easy enough to keep track of the state in the bot itself, if you want to expose the same functionality
2011-04-30T03:46:14  <smiley1983> (he merged my last two recently without complaint, but a third so soon would be pushing my luck)
2011-04-30T03:46:49  <sigh_> other people can merge too :)
2011-04-30T03:47:21  <smiley1983> I guess. It's not an urgent change so I'll wait and see if anything develops in further conversation.
2011-04-30T03:47:56  <sigh_> yeah, that seems a bit better
2011-04-30T03:50:33  <sigh_> @later tell McLeopold I strongly suggest removing the 'r' output. It is complicated to explain, causes a lot of confusion and the implementation makes it easy to introduce bugs for bots that actually use it.
2011-04-30T03:50:33  <contestbot> sigh_: I come to serve.
2011-04-30T03:53:17  <smiley1983> I do agree: it will of course break the bots which now expect it, but there's clearly plenty of time before the contest begins. :)
2011-04-30T03:53:35  <sigh_> it's not even beta yet :P
2011-04-30T03:53:58  <smiley1983> exactly, so now is the time for such changes if at all

2011-04-30T07:15:51  <MuTa-ofd00m> :(:(:(
2011-04-30T07:15:53  <mcstar> hm
2011-04-30T07:15:57  <mcstar> type error
2011-04-30T07:16:01  <mcstar> interesting
2011-04-30T07:16:15  <MuTa-ofd00m> does it matter which browser I use?
2011-04-30T07:16:27  <mcstar> maybe
2011-04-30T07:16:35  <mcstar> have u got js debnug console?
2011-04-30T07:16:41  <MuTa-ofd00m> there we go
2011-04-30T07:16:44  <MuTa-ofd00m> works in firefox
2011-04-30T07:16:47  <MuTa-ofd00m> wohoooooooo =)=) <3<3 thanks guys
2011-04-30T07:16:55  <mcstar> document.getElementById('txtReplay').value;
2011-04-30T07:17:06  <mcstar> i guess this line offends ur other browser
2011-04-30T07:17:19  <mcstar> which was?
2011-04-30T07:17:22  <MuTa-ofd00m> yep, there was some sort of "read from file" that they didn't permit
2011-04-30T07:17:30  <MuTa-ofd00m> internet explorer, avant browser, chrome, opera
2011-04-30T07:17:32  <MuTa-ofd00m> all failed
2011-04-30T07:17:35  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-30T07:17:58  <mcstar> that will cause some trouble for others :)
2011-04-30T07:18:15  <MuTa-ofd00m> yep, hopefully they'll ask in here :)
2011-04-30T07:19:38  <MuTa-ofd00m> Okay so last question before the coding begins: Where do I select which bots to be run in the simulation? atm I see 4 similar bots running
2011-04-30T07:21:12  <mcstar> play_one_game.cmd
2011-04-30T07:21:26  <mcstar> "python dist/sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py"
2011-04-30T07:21:33  <mcstar> there are 4 arguments like this
2011-04-30T07:21:40  <MuTa-ofd00m> ah yes ofc, I understand it =)
2011-04-30T07:22:35  <MuTa-ofd00m> I see it says "python dist/sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py" - What should I specify for c-sharp and is it even supported yet?
2011-04-30T07:22:55  <mcstar> i guess the path to the binary
2011-04-30T07:23:16  <mcstar> havent tried it yet
2011-04-30T07:23:16  <MuTa-ofd00m> kk thx for all the help, greatly appreciated :)
2011-04-30T07:23:32  <mcstar> ur welcome
2011-04-30T07:23:36  <mcstar> but try it first
2011-04-30T07:23:51  <mcstar> i have to look at playgame first

2011-04-30T09:40:42  <mcstar> wth
2011-04-30T09:40:48  <mcstar> map with 10 bots???
2011-04-30T09:41:59  <mcstar> are you guys planning to really let 10 bots play at the same time on the same map?
2011-04-30T09:42:09  <mcstar> so its not going to be 1 on 1?
2011-04-30T09:42:56  <mcstar> btw
2011-04-30T09:43:06  <mcstar> the visualization http sever works nicely
2011-04-30T09:43:15  <mcstar> it only needs a time slider
2011-04-30T09:48:02  <mcstar> i changed the number of players in the map file

2011-04-30T09:48:37  <mcstar> c
2011-04-30T09:48:42  <mcstar> wth is going on?
2011-04-30T09:49:38  <mcstar> it seems everyone is out, gardening :(

2011-04-30T10:18:14  <bhasker> morning
2011-04-30T10:18:25  <bhasker> where is the http server?
2011-04-30T10:20:09  <mcstar> ants/viewer
2011-04-30T10:20:24  <mcstar> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
2011-04-30T10:20:43  <mcstar> and the readme says open ur browser at localhost:8000
2011-04-30T10:20:50  <bhasker> ah that one yea
2011-04-30T10:20:50  <mcstar> then u get e filesystemview
2011-04-30T10:21:06  <mcstar> its sort of rudimentary
2011-04-30T10:21:14  <mcstar> needs a slider
2011-04-30T10:21:40  <mcstar> bhasker: can u answer my question regarding the participating bots?
2011-04-30T10:21:50  <bhasker> which question is that?
2011-04-30T10:22:00  <bhasker> btw i am not an organizer:) so i may not know the answer
2011-04-30T10:22:13  <mcstar> i saw that certains maps have up to 10 bots
2011-04-30T10:22:37  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-30T10:22:38  <mcstar> i thought it would b ea 1 on 1 battle
2011-04-30T10:22:44  <bhasker> its not
2011-04-30T10:22:48  <bhasker> that much is certain
2011-04-30T10:23:14  <mcstar> so what, at least 4 bots play 1 map?
2011-04-30T10:23:23  <bhasker> i think most maps generated right now have > 4
2011-04-30T10:23:45  <mcstar> man, i have to rethink my strategy alltogether
2011-04-30T10:23:53  <bhasker> not sure what format will be decided upon, i guess it all depends on how scoring/rankging is done
2011-04-30T10:23:59  <mcstar> i proved the perfect startegy already for 2 players
2011-04-30T10:24:00  <bhasker> and ensuring that bots get to play maps evenly
2011-04-30T10:24:29  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-30T10:24:32  <bhasker> well you can still treat it as a 2 player game
2011-04-30T10:24:34  <bhasker> you vs the world
2011-04-30T10:24:41  <mcstar> btw i was joking
2011-04-30T10:24:51  <mcstar> but i guess thats true
2011-04-30T10:25:07  <mcstar> i just thought there would me more room to explorer
2011-04-30T10:25:08  <bhasker> though i guess intelligent bots might push against certain bots
2011-04-30T10:25:09  <mcstar> -r
2011-04-30T10:25:12  <bhasker> to gain more territory
2011-04-30T10:25:18  <bhasker> than go up against stronger bots
2011-04-30T10:25:30  <bhasker> well i think the maps might be bigger than 120x100
2011-04-30T10:25:39  <bhasker> i think nothing is decided on what size maps will be used etc
2011-04-30T10:25:46  <bhasker> i think it will be decided during the beta etc
2011-04-30T10:25:47  <mcstar> but the question is if theres enough time to differentiate between the bots
2011-04-30T10:25:59  <bhasker> as the contest evolves and there is more feedback
2011-04-30T10:26:20  <bhasker> i think the idea is for games to last 1000 turns
2011-04-30T10:26:25  <bhasker> it should be enough to differentiate
2011-04-30T10:26:35  <mcstar> i just tried to run for 1000
2011-04-30T10:26:44  <mcstar> but the game ended b4
2011-04-30T10:26:51  <mcstar> 1 bot timed out
2011-04-30T10:26:57  <bhasker> well that may not be true once bots get complicated
2011-04-30T10:26:59  <mcstar> the replay file seemed good
2011-04-30T10:27:05  <mcstar> but i couldnt visualize it
2011-04-30T10:27:11  <bhasker> right now most bots are probably trivial and not very smart
2011-04-30T10:27:21  <bhasker> i am guessing as bots get smarter combat will be entered into less often
2011-04-30T10:27:27  <bhasker> and there will be a lot of back and forth
2011-04-30T10:27:37  <mcstar> yes
2011-04-30T10:27:41  <mcstar> thats possible
2011-04-30T10:27:49  <mcstar> the numbers may oscillate
2011-04-30T10:27:52  <bhasker> bots won't blindly rush in to die
2011-04-30T10:28:04  <bhasker> and i am guessing complex bots will make use of bottlenecks
2011-04-30T10:28:12  <bhasker> and try to mark their territory out
2011-04-30T10:28:35  <bhasker> so as to maximize food availability
2011-04-30T10:28:36  <mcstar> the territory grows with r^2
2011-04-30T10:28:58  <bhasker> true, maybe hard but you could potentially block off certain parts
2011-04-30T10:29:06  <bhasker> and concentrate on access through few corridors
2011-04-30T10:29:08  <mcstar> so where are u now?
2011-04-30T10:29:19  <mcstar> only ideas or u got some programme din?
2011-04-30T10:29:20  <bhasker> well my first version was a basic bfs searcher
2011-04-30T10:29:30  <bhasker> second one added an ability for potential fields
2011-04-30T10:29:35  <bhasker> for exploring
2011-04-30T10:29:52  <bhasker> and some basic battle logistics
2011-04-30T10:29:58  <bhasker> to be able to make move, check result and unmake
2011-04-30T10:30:01  <mcstar> well i dont know these terms
2011-04-30T10:30:12  <bhasker> well the first one does a simple breadth first search
2011-04-30T10:30:15  <bhasker> it takes each ant
2011-04-30T10:30:17  <mcstar> im not a computer science guy
2011-04-30T10:30:22  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-30T10:30:34  <bhasker> hmm basically a bfs is you start at say point A
2011-04-30T10:30:40  <bhasker> and you explore all adjoining points to A
2011-04-30T10:30:46  <bhasker> before going one step further
2011-04-30T10:30:54  <bhasker> so you expand your search space incrementally
2011-04-30T10:31:01  <bhasker> till you hit your goal
2011-04-30T10:31:12  <mcstar> like swiping?
2011-04-30T10:31:16  <bhasker> so starting at an ant i can expand outwards till i find a food, then extract the path
2011-04-30T10:31:16  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@210.18.207.102> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2011-04-30T10:31:17  <bhasker> to the food
2011-04-30T10:31:29  <bhasker> let me giev you a nice link to pathfinding
2011-04-30T10:31:41  <mcstar> but that path can be very long
2011-04-30T10:31:44  <bhasker> it will help you make your bots a little more intelligent on how they get to food and route around obstacles
2011-04-30T10:31:55  <bhasker> well i restrict my space to view radius around the ant
2011-04-30T10:31:58  <bhasker> i don't search the whole map
2011-04-30T10:31:59  <mcstar> true
2011-04-30T10:32:01  <bhasker> everytime
2011-04-30T10:32:08  <mcstar> so its a tunnel u see
2011-04-30T10:32:14  <bhasker> kind of
2011-04-30T10:32:43  <bhasker> in most cases view radius is sufficient to route to most nearby spots
2011-04-30T10:32:49  <bhasker> i rarely send my ants across the map right now
2011-04-30T10:33:08  <mcstar> is the size of the map known beforehand?
2011-04-30T10:33:11  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-30T10:33:12  <bhasker> on turn 1
2011-04-30T10:33:17  <bhasker> it sends rows/cols
2011-04-30T10:33:24  <bhasker> rather turn 0
2011-04-30T10:33:25  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-30T10:33:28  <bhasker> there is a setup turn
2011-04-30T10:33:30  <bhasker> and a setup time
2011-04-30T10:33:34  <bhasker> you get like 3 seconds on turn 0
2011-04-30T10:33:40  <bhasker> to do any one time initializations
2011-04-30T10:33:42  <bhasker> etc
2011-04-30T10:33:53  <mcstar> but i heard that the map is not sent, so u dont have an owerview of the water
2011-04-30T10:33:58  <bhasker> yes map is not sent
2011-04-30T10:34:18  <bhasker> actually i think it is
2011-04-30T10:34:24  <bhasker> let me look at the code
2011-04-30T10:34:39  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-208-118.dynamic.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-30T10:34:41  <bhasker> oh maybe not
2011-04-30T10:35:04  <bhasker> yea you just get some meta data about the map
2011-04-30T10:35:08  <bhasker> like rows/columns etc
2011-04-30T10:35:15  <bhasker> and attack radius etc
2011-04-30T10:35:52  <bhasker> you get total number of turns for the game
2011-04-30T10:36:02  <bhasker> load time and turn time
2011-04-30T10:36:46  <mcstar> do you agree that this challenge seems harder than the one before?
2011-04-30T10:37:06  <bhasker> yes it  is since there are more than 2 people
2011-04-30T10:37:08  <bhasker> per game
2011-04-30T10:37:16  <bhasker> its more like an RTS now
2011-04-30T10:38:05  <mcstar> whats that potential based thingy?
2011-04-30T10:38:24  <bhasker> http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2009/910819/
2011-04-30T10:38:27  <bhasker> potential fields
2011-04-30T10:38:35  <bhasker> you can use them as a way to do pathfinding/exploration etc
2011-04-30T10:38:51  <bhasker> you assign values to certain areas that spread out radially
2011-04-30T10:38:54  <bhasker> and fall off
2011-04-30T10:39:07  <bhasker> and you move your ant based on potential of the squares surrounding it
2011-04-30T10:39:31  <bhasker> so you could potentially rate unexplored areas higher and if you move the ant towards higher potential areas
2011-04-30T10:39:40  <bhasker> then ti will automatically tned to explore unseen areas
2011-04-30T10:39:41  <bhasker> etc
2011-04-30T10:39:51  <bhasker> you could put higher potential fields around nearby ants
2011-04-30T10:39:53  <bhasker> to make them cluster
2011-04-30T10:40:03  <bhasker> and -ve potential on enemies
2011-04-30T10:40:08  <mcstar> so it uses differentiability to predict potential gain?
2011-04-30T10:40:09  <bhasker> to make your ants automatically avoid enemies
2011-04-30T10:40:43  <bhasker> kind of, mostly its a way to decide what an ant should do at any point
2011-04-30T10:41:05  <bhasker> rather than explicitly telling the ant what to do
2011-04-30T10:41:16  <mcstar> so its like a dynamics potential, the independent variable is the coordinate
2011-04-30T10:41:24  <bhasker> k i lost you there
2011-04-30T10:41:24  <mcstar> and ur bots move along field lines?
2011-04-30T10:41:29  <bhasker> kind of
2011-04-30T10:41:30  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-30T10:41:42  <bhasker> you could make obstacles repell your bots etc
2011-04-30T10:41:48  <bhasker> so your bot will automatically route around them
2011-04-30T10:41:50  <bhasker> etc
2011-04-30T10:42:04  <mcstar> well, i can see that this has analytical value
2011-04-30T10:42:13  <bhasker> yea it helps identify hotspots
2011-04-30T10:42:17  <bhasker> and areas of interest
2011-04-30T10:42:25  <bhasker> like you could give areas with lot of dead ants
2011-04-30T10:42:29  <mcstar> but is good to algorithmically implement this?
2011-04-30T10:42:32  <bhasker> maybe lower potential so that your ants stay away
2011-04-30T10:42:45  <bhasker> its not too expensive to calculate
2011-04-30T10:43:12  <bhasker> though my results have been very mixed and my current implementation is rather crappy
2011-04-30T10:43:16  <mcstar> do they use it in real softwares?
2011-04-30T10:43:23  <bhasker> hmm mostly in games etc
2011-04-30T10:43:40  <mcstar> bc its a 2008 article thats why im asking
2011-04-30T10:43:46  <mcstar> kind of new
2011-04-30T10:43:50  <bhasker> i think there are a few game AI's that use it
2011-04-30T10:44:00  <bhasker> the other thing that RTS AI's use are what are called influence maps
2011-04-30T10:45:39  <mcstar> no wiki
2011-04-30T10:46:53  <bhasker> http://74.6.117.48/search/srpcache?ei=UTF-8&p=influence+maps+RTS&fr=crmas&u=http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=influence+maps+RTS&d=4952990835475890&mkt=en-US&setlang=en-US&w=115799ed,80367371&icp=1&.intl=us&sig=1LGLNqBpUswzTPEBqw7cWQ--
2011-04-30T10:48:31  <mcstar> so this makes a weighted graph from the map?
2011-04-30T10:48:44  <bhasker> kind of yes
2011-04-30T10:49:07  <mcstar> this sounds better
2011-04-30T10:49:15  <bhasker> search for RTS AI
2011-04-30T10:49:19  <bhasker> you will find numerous articles
2011-04-30T10:49:22  <mcstar> at least this is discrete from the start
2011-04-30T10:50:00  <mcstar> i will try to implement something from my physics background
2011-04-30T10:50:09  <mcstar> if im not too stupid for that
2011-04-30T10:50:28  <bhasker> http://aigamedev.com/
2011-04-30T10:50:37  <bhasker> this is a nice website which has some free articles that you can read
2011-04-30T10:50:43  <bhasker> some of the other articles require you to pay
2011-04-30T10:51:21  <mcstar> thx for the links
2011-04-30T10:51:48  <mcstar> actually i just got an idea
2011-04-30T10:51:57  <bhasker> this is a good forum too http://www.gamedev.net/forum/9-artificial-intelligence/
2011-04-30T10:53:10  <mcstar> i dont think that the smartest bot will win
2011-04-30T10:53:22  <mcstar> i mean the one that implements state of the art logic
2011-04-30T10:53:25  <mcstar> or methods
2011-04-30T10:53:47  <mcstar> i think that transparent, robust method will prevail
2011-04-30T10:53:57  <mcstar> in this contest the real ai is the developer
2011-04-30T10:54:11  <bhasker> lets see
2011-04-30T10:54:12  <bhasker> http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/
2011-04-30T10:54:34  <bhasker> this blog is from one of the authors of a commerical game engine, he maintains an opensource 3d pathfinding library
2011-04-30T10:54:40  <bhasker> called recast and detour
2011-04-30T10:54:55  <bhasker> most of it is not relevant to this game but its an interesting read
2011-04-30T10:55:29  <mcstar> he is living my dream
2011-04-30T10:55:36  <mcstar> Our startup just opened a public beta.
2011-04-30T10:55:40  <bhasker> hehe
2011-04-30T10:55:50  <bhasker> another nice article on certain AI behaviours

2011-04-30T10:55:52  <mcstar> that would be nice to say some day
2011-04-30T10:55:59  <bhasker> how to implement like seek/flee
2011-04-30T10:56:03  <bhasker> pursue and evade
2011-04-30T10:56:04  <bhasker> etc
2011-04-30T10:56:18  <bhasker> flocking/leader following etc

2011-04-30T10:56:40  <bhasker> this guy has some of the best pathfinding tutorials
2011-04-30T10:56:45  <bhasker> that you can find on the net

2011-04-30T10:59:03  <bhasker> if you are good at math i think yes
2011-04-30T10:59:06  <bhasker> AI is more math
2011-04-30T10:59:09  <bhasker> than comp sci
2011-04-30T10:59:18  <bhasker> comp sci part only comes to how to efficiently implement it
2011-04-30T10:59:31  <bhasker> for that you can take a data structures course
2011-04-30T10:59:42  <bhasker> i am crappy at math but decent and comp sci
2011-04-30T10:59:48  <bhasker> i would make an average ai programmer
2011-04-30T11:00:05  <mcstar> im asking if its not a big problem, that i will have another degree
2011-04-30T11:00:26  <bhasker> i don't think most game companies care about your degree as long as you know a few things

2011-04-30T11:00:49  <bhasker> most game programmers are probably not comp sci grads
2011-04-30T11:00:56  <bhasker> games today have a lot of physics too
2011-04-30T11:01:02  <bhasker> so you could be a physics programmer
2011-04-30T11:01:08  <bhasker> if you wanted
2011-04-30T11:01:17  <bhasker> there are companies dedicated to designing physics middleware
2011-04-30T11:01:19  <bhasker> like havok
2011-04-30T11:01:20  <mcstar> ty i will see my future a little brighter :)
2011-04-30T11:01:30  <bhasker> which are used by games for all physics simulations
2011-04-30T11:01:36  <bhasker> there are open source alternatives too like
2011-04-30T11:01:46  <mcstar> yeah i heard of it
2011-04-30T11:01:47  <bhasker> ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) and BulletPhysics
2011-04-30T11:01:53  <bhasker> and Newton
2011-04-30T11:02:04  <bhasker> a lot of open source game engines today integrate these libraries
2011-04-30T11:02:17  <bhasker> like Ogre/CrystalSpace/Irrlicht/Panda3d
2011-04-30T11:02:25  <mcstar> i guess theyre rewriten them to run on gpu-s
2011-04-30T11:02:42  <bhasker> no most of these still run on cpu
2011-04-30T11:02:53  <bhasker> i guess havok makes use of physx
2011-04-30T11:02:59  <bhasker> and i think some game engines support that too
2011-04-30T11:03:01  <mcstar> yeah but they would benefit from it l
2011-04-30T11:03:19  <bhasker> yes some of them are making use of the nvidia PhysX apis
2011-04-30T11:03:20  <mcstar> im kind of certain that its in progress

2011-04-30T11:04:54  <mcstar> GeForce GPUs with PhysX provide an exponential increase in physics processing power
2011-04-30T11:05:02  <mcstar> not sure what they mean by that
2011-04-30T11:05:27  <bhasker> well since GPUs are inherently paralle
2011-04-30T11:05:36  <bhasker> you can do a lot of physics calculations in parallel
2011-04-30T11:05:48  <mcstar> that sentence is wrong
2011-04-30T11:06:01  <bhasker> why would you say that
2011-04-30T11:06:09  <mcstar> in that sense everything is exponential
2011-04-30T11:06:39  <bhasker> well its marketing speak so take it with a grain of salt
2011-04-30T11:06:47  <mcstar> thats what i mean
2011-04-30T11:07:40  <bhasker> mostly if you do physics calculations on cpu you are limited to one at a time on a single core or at most 4-8 depending on number of cores on the computer
2011-04-30T11:07:47  <bhasker> but most GPU's today have over 400+ cores
2011-04-30T11:07:56  <mcstar> i do them on gpu
2011-04-30T11:08:00  <bhasker> so you could do a lot more parallel calculations
2011-04-30T11:08:08  <bhasker> thats what they mean by exponential increase
2011-04-30T11:08:15  <mcstar> we have a couple of teslas
2011-04-30T11:08:18  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-30T11:08:34  <mcstar> 4 tesla and 8 core xenon
2011-04-30T11:08:39  <mcstar> in a box
2011-04-30T11:08:43  <mcstar> and we have 4 of them
2011-04-30T11:08:52  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-30T11:09:00  <mcstar> 48GB memory
2011-04-30T11:09:11  <mcstar> quite noisy though
2011-04-30T11:09:25  <bhasker> heh i guess so
2011-04-30T11:09:29  <bhasker> with that many gpus
2011-04-30T11:09:58  <mcstar> and have 2 rooms filled with 3 clusters
2011-04-30T11:10:23  <mcstar> but im not sure i want to do computational physics though
2011-04-30T11:10:39  <mcstar> i will figure it out
2011-04-30T11:10:59  <mcstar> but this contest will have some say in my future plans
2011-04-30T11:11:42  <mcstar> are you interfacing with outside 3rd party libraies?
2011-04-30T11:11:54  <bhasker> nope
2011-04-30T11:12:06  <bhasker> i am writing in c++ and i doubt i will use any external library
2011-04-30T11:12:20  <mcstar> i dont intend to either
2011-04-30T11:12:33  <bhasker> the game is quite simple to not really require external libraries
2011-04-30T11:12:45  <bhasker> pathfinding a simple bread first search works in most cases
2011-04-30T11:12:45  <mcstar> in the last couple of days i upped my cl knowledge
2011-04-30T11:12:54  <mcstar> so now i can begin write
2011-04-30T11:12:58  <mcstar> to
2011-04-30T11:13:01  <bhasker> which language?
2011-04-30T11:13:10  <mcstar> common lisp
2011-04-30T11:13:14  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-30T11:13:26  <bhasker> my knowledge of functional programming is very limited
2011-04-30T11:13:48  <mcstar> i used mathematica a lot
2011-04-30T11:13:52  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-30T11:14:05  <mcstar> and tried a tiny tiny bit of haskell
2011-04-30T11:14:18  <mcstar> but cl is not just functional
2011-04-30T11:14:21  <mcstar> as i understand now
2011-04-30T11:14:32  <mcstar> basically u can do any programming model in it
2011-04-30T11:14:39  <bhasker> hmm i thought lisp was mostly functional
2011-04-30T11:14:42  <mcstar> even lazy evaluation can be implemented
2011-04-30T11:14:45  <bhasker> or at least most people used it that way
2011-04-30T11:14:46  <mcstar> no
2011-04-30T11:14:52  <mcstar> has a good object system
2011-04-30T11:15:00  <bhasker> oh k
2011-04-30T11:15:04  <mcstar> but u dont have to use it of course
2011-04-30T11:26:17  <mcstar> im afraid that in the end my ai will look like a very big if-else forest

2011-04-30T13:19:17  <smiley1983> antimatroid: are you aware that the engine sends food removal lines last? If food spawns on a tile on the same turn as you get a "r row col" line for the same tile, you get both lines, but the "r" will be last. Many bots (including mine currently) will respond incorrectly in this case.
2011-04-30T13:19:39  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i saw that conversation, yes that presents problems :P
2011-04-30T13:20:12  <smiley1983> My current plan is to clear all food information as before, and present the "removed food" list to the player verbatim to do with as they will.
2011-04-30T13:20:31  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be surprised if the 'r' lines get removed
2011-04-30T13:20:49  <smiley1983> Which will break all the bots now using it, but oh well
2011-04-30T13:25:02  <mcstar> There is no break.

2011-04-30T14:12:38  <bhasker> will it be the plan in the final?
2011-04-30T14:12:41  <antimatroid> but i expect assymetric maps to be a roaring failure fairness wise
2011-04-30T14:12:50  <antimatroid> hopefully not, but it's not my decision
2011-04-30T14:12:58  <bhasker> cause i am seeing my bot play differently depending on which position i play from
2011-04-30T14:13:06  <bhasker> and lose miserably sometimes
2011-04-30T14:13:10  <antimatroid> yes, asymmetric maps suck
2011-04-30T14:13:10  <bhasker> sometimes crush the opposition
2011-04-30T14:13:17  <bhasker> even your symmetric maps are not perfect
2011-04-30T14:13:24  <bhasker> they are not symmetrical for all players
2011-04-30T14:13:31  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-04-30T14:13:44  <antimatroid> they are symmetry excluding relative starting postions
2011-04-30T14:13:51  <antimatroid> that's not possible with more than 3 players
2011-04-30T14:13:54  <Naktibalda> MuTa-ofd00m: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/pull/44
2011-04-30T14:14:05  <antimatroid> symmetric*
2011-04-30T14:14:40  <bhasker> i am looking at the symmetric map but it doesn't look symmetric to me
2011-04-30T14:14:54  <bhasker> let me show you
2011-04-30T14:16:07  <bhasker> http://pastebin.com/P6tmF8f6
2011-04-30T14:16:12  <mcstar> its translation symmetric
2011-04-30T14:16:17  <bhasker> thats a replay form symmetric_10.map
2011-04-30T14:16:26  <bhasker> what does that mean translation symmetric?
2011-04-30T14:16:27  <mcstar> that one too
2011-04-30T14:16:32  <mcstar> theres a unit cell
2011-04-30T14:16:49  <mcstar> which is translated on the 2 basis vectors
2011-04-30T14:17:35  <mcstar> so bots can be placed in places with the same surroundings
2011-04-30T14:17:41  <bhasker> it doesn't look like it
2011-04-30T14:17:43  <bhasker> in the replay
2011-04-30T14:17:51  <bhasker> in 4 player map
2011-04-30T14:18:03  <mcstar> i will look at it
2011-04-30T14:18:15  <mcstar> but as far as i remember i found 10 to be symmetric
2011-04-30T14:18:26  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-04-30T14:19:10  <antimatroid> it is symmetric

2011-04-30T14:19:25  <bhasker> look at the start position for blue
2011-04-30T14:19:26  <antimatroid> bhasker: have you looked at the map gen
2011-04-30T14:19:27  <mcstar> it is symmetric
2011-04-30T14:19:34  <bhasker> it looks very different from the others
2011-04-30T14:19:38  <antimatroid> it was really fun working out how to do that
2011-04-30T14:20:13  <mcstar> if you translate their positions into a single point, the map will perfectly overlap
2011-04-30T14:20:31  <antimatroid> if you have rows and row_translate, the number of translations to get back into the same row is rows/gcd(rows, row_translate)
2011-04-30T14:20:32  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-04-30T14:20:34  <mcstar> you know what
2011-04-30T14:20:42  <mcstar> press the window button
2011-04-30T14:20:49  <mcstar> on the right side
2011-04-30T14:20:50  <antimatroid> then to get the orders of row and column translates to match up you get lcm of those two numbers
2011-04-30T14:20:55  <mcstar> above AZ
2011-04-30T14:20:55  <bhasker> ah k i see it
2011-04-30T14:21:27  <antimatroid> there's some extra checks in there to make sure no two players start in the same row or column etc.
2011-04-30T14:22:19  <antimatroid> in the end it's just tessellations on a torus
2011-04-30T14:22:40  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure you get vector spaces if you take the continuous case
2011-04-30T14:23:20  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-04-30T14:23:26  <mcstar> it is a vector space
2011-04-30T14:24:03  <mcstar> u just have a bit of congruance
2011-04-30T14:24:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: how come you did the map generator?
2011-04-30T14:25:18  <mcstar> i mean u will participate in the contest right?

2011-04-30T14:27:07  <antimatroid> others are welcome to write generators for more maps, the more the merrier imo
2011-04-30T14:27:10  <mcstar> yeah, but u have less time for yourslef then :)
2011-04-30T14:27:29  <mcstar> i dont complain
2011-04-30T14:27:31  <antimatroid> i've been trying not to do too much bot related before the contest starts
2011-04-30T14:27:32  <mcstar> far from it
2011-04-30T14:27:41  <antimatroid> i already have enough of an advantage
2011-04-30T14:27:55  <antimatroid> although i'm not sure how much time i will actually have anyway in the end
2011-04-30T14:28:20  <antimatroid> i'm here for fun, and making map generators is one of the funnest problems :P so that's my motivation
2011-04-30T14:28:43  <antimatroid> McLeopold has a cool one based off my partitioning of the grid in map_analyzer.py
2011-04-30T14:28:49  <mcstar> ok, well ty
2011-04-30T14:29:23  <antimatroid> you can basically construct examples where any number of ants can reach a square in the same number of turns
2011-04-30T14:29:58  <antimatroid> the map_analyzer partitions the set of locations into sets of which ants can reach them first
2011-04-30T14:30:30  <mcstar> its like a voronoi diagram but here we call it wigner seitz cell
2011-04-30T14:30:51  <antimatroid> i call it a voronoi diagram, but not sure if that's correct?
2011-04-30T14:30:59  <mcstar> correct
2011-04-30T14:31:01  <antimatroid> so i reverted to just saying it's a partition
2011-04-30T14:31:12  <antimatroid> maths talk i can do
2011-04-30T14:31:40  <antimatroid> well, to a certain extent :P
2011-04-30T14:31:48  <antimatroid> such a large rabbit hole
2011-04-30T14:32:05  <mcstar> hm
2011-04-30T14:32:10  <mcstar> u hunt rabbits ?
2011-04-30T14:32:10  <antimatroid> bhasker: what makes map 10 look different to the other maps to you?
2011-04-30T14:32:13  <antimatroid> no
2011-04-30T14:32:26  <bhasker> nm its fine i was mistaken
2011-04-30T14:32:33  <antimatroid> i feel bad about all the bugs i must kill on a daily basis :\
2011-04-30T14:32:38  <mcstar> its randomness i guess :)
2011-04-30T14:33:14  <antimatroid> i would love to see a 3d viewer on a toroud
2011-04-30T14:33:17  <antimatroid> torus* aha
2011-04-30T14:33:45  <mcstar> why? i dont see any advantage of it
2011-04-30T14:33:49  <antimatroid> where you could change the angle, and rotate the torus with the arrow keys to translate it around either circle
2011-04-30T14:33:56  <antimatroid> it would be novelty and awesome :P
2011-04-30T14:34:02  <mcstar> u mean eyecandy
2011-04-30T14:34:06  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-30T14:34:22  <antimatroid> there was an icpc ai-challenge that had an eyecandy 3d visualizer
2011-04-30T14:34:25  <mcstar> then pls write it and i might consider using it as a screensaver
2011-04-30T14:34:41  <antimatroid> i don't know how to do guis :P
2011-04-30T14:34:46  <mcstar> hey theres one already
2011-04-30T14:34:59  <mcstar> some ants crawl on mobius strip
2011-04-30T14:35:11  <mcstar> i used ogl before
2011-04-30T14:35:13  <mcstar> its easy
2011-04-30T14:35:15  <antimatroid> we have joked about making the maps a klein bottle :P
2011-04-30T14:35:44  <mcstar> i wrote a mandelbrot set viewer in cpp
2011-04-30T14:35:47  <mcstar> some years ago
2011-04-30T14:35:58  <mcstar> it was pretty awesome
2011-04-30T14:36:02  <mcstar> but i lost it since
2011-04-30T14:36:19  <antimatroid> some of the 3d fractals you see online are pretty cool
2011-04-30T14:36:45  <antimatroid> i have the most fun with stuff from algebra and analysis, where one can fully wrap their head around what's going on

2011-04-30T14:37:40  <antimatroid> just the way such topics are treated, it's like microeconomics and game theory, you start from the basic definitions and build the theory from there
2011-04-30T14:37:59  <antimatroid> rather than just trying to describe what we already see
2011-04-30T14:38:23  <mcstar> well if u want real progress u have to have real foundations
2011-04-30T14:38:45  <antimatroid> ?
2011-04-30T14:39:17  <mcstar> u said u like the way mathematics is structured
2011-04-30T14:39:27  <antimatroid> mostly pure maths
2011-04-30T14:39:35  <antimatroid> applied maths makes me want to rip my hair out
2011-04-30T14:39:38  <mcstar> there are some "sciences" which arent build on such strong foundation

2011-04-30T14:41:14  <mcstar> very fast and very capable
2011-04-30T14:41:33  <antimatroid> do you know much about game theory?
2011-04-30T14:41:35  <mcstar> can do 3d too
2011-04-30T14:41:43  <mcstar> well i know it exists
2011-04-30T14:42:36  <mcstar> maybe i will read about it sometimes
2011-04-30T14:42:40  <antimatroid> i haz a game theory library that i'm slowly building :P

2011-04-30T14:44:05  <antimatroid> well, what's there works, but there's lot's that hasn't been added to what's on github yet, and nothing in the way of a gui, just a library
2011-04-30T14:44:28  <mcstar> i dont think u should bother with guis
2011-04-30T14:44:50  <mcstar> those classes arent implemented elsewhere?
2011-04-30T14:45:03  <mcstar> tensor vector rational?
2011-04-30T14:45:20  <antimatroid> i like people to be able to use the library with just stl

2011-04-30T14:47:59  <antimatroid> i need that to do a lot of mixed strategy functions

2011-04-30T14:49:36  <antimatroid> you are guaranteed there exists at least one solution

2011-04-30T14:54:26  <mcstar> for example ur bot isnt easy
2011-04-30T14:54:35  <mcstar> i mean there are quite some concepts
2011-04-30T14:54:39  <mcstar> u have to be familiar with
2011-04-30T14:54:44  <mcstar> to see it through
2011-04-30T14:54:50  <mcstar> and then theres the syntax

2011-04-30T14:55:16  <mcstar> he doesnt really know c
2011-04-30T14:55:33  <mcstar> i was telling him about pointers and stuff

2011-04-30T14:56:15  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-30T14:56:24  <mcstar> then lets pick another language
2011-04-30T14:56:30  <antimatroid> unless you are using a game tree, I can avoid touching pointers and delete with c++ bots
2011-04-30T14:56:34  <mcstar> i dont mean cpp in particular
2011-04-30T14:57:08  <mcstar> oh and the whole environment
2011-04-30T14:57:22  <mcstar> the compilation process make linux editors
2011-04-30T14:57:24  <mcstar> ......
2011-04-30T14:57:34  <mcstar> when all this comes almost at once
2011-04-30T14:57:34  <antimatroid> tell them to download something like codeblocks (c++ specific), create a project and add all the files to the project
2011-04-30T14:57:45  <mcstar> one can be pretty much f_cked
2011-04-30T14:57:48  <antimatroid> that's what I do, then i just hit f9 and it all just compiles nicely :)

2011-04-30T15:00:06  <mcstar> i used kubuntu for like a year after
2011-04-30T15:00:14  <mcstar> i got fed up with that
2011-04-30T15:00:20  <mcstar> and then at last
2011-04-30T15:00:23  <mcstar> i found arch
2011-04-30T15:00:33  <mcstar> im using it since 2 years
2011-04-30T15:00:37  <mcstar> for
2011-04-30T15:00:40  <mcstar> not since
2011-04-30T15:01:00  <jaycobcoleman> Is compatibility a big issue?
2011-04-30T15:01:01  <mcstar> theres nothing not to like about it
2011-04-30T15:01:06  <mcstar> no
2011-04-30T15:01:27  <mcstar> i didnt find any issues regarding compatibility
2011-04-30T15:01:33  <jaycobcoleman> cool :P
2011-04-30T15:01:42  <jaycobcoleman> I might try it out after the competition is over
2011-04-30T15:01:46  <mcstar> i reinstalled only once
2011-04-30T15:02:00  <mcstar> becaus ein last year december
2011-04-30T15:02:04  <mcstar> my hdd crashed
2011-04-30T15:02:17  <mcstar> i highly recommend
2011-04-30T15:02:27  <mcstar> how much do u know about linux?
2011-04-30T15:02:37  <jaycobcoleman> I'm on ubuntu right now and I have no problems with it, but I like to experiment
2011-04-30T15:02:43  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-30T15:02:48  <jaycobcoleman> I know more than enought to make my way around
2011-04-30T15:02:51  <jaycobcoleman> -t
2011-04-30T15:02:55  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-30T15:03:00  <mcstar> and it has a very good wiki
2011-04-30T15:03:07  <mcstar> and lots of stuff in the forums
2011-04-30T15:03:19  <mcstar> basically i didnt have to write in forums
2011-04-30T15:03:24  <mcstar> since i use it
2011-04-30T15:03:36  <mcstar> have u heard of AUR?
2011-04-30T15:03:52  <jaycobcoleman> nope
2011-04-30T15:04:01  <antimatroid> i can't find a screenshots page?
2011-04-30T15:04:04  <antimatroid> to see what it looks like
2011-04-30T15:04:14  <antimatroid> i'm a fan of simple, but not if it looks awful
2011-04-30T15:04:21  <mcstar> theres no look
2011-04-30T15:04:28  <mcstar> what do u mean how does it look like?
2011-04-30T15:04:35  <mcstar> its not a girl
2011-04-30T15:04:35  <antimatroid> oh, it's all command line?
2011-04-30T15:04:37  <mcstar> its lego
2011-04-30T15:04:45  <jaycobcoleman> hmm
2011-04-30T15:04:51  <antimatroid> screw that :P
2011-04-30T15:05:00  <mcstar> u can have everything or nothing
2011-04-30T15:05:01  <jaycobcoleman> sooonot not exactly "user-friendly?"
2011-04-30T15:05:09  <mcstar> the core install is done in a couple of minutes
2011-04-30T15:05:09  <jaycobcoleman> -not
2011-04-30T15:05:17  <MuTa-ofd00m> In play_one_game.cmd - What do I need to write, instead of "python" to indicate my bot is "csharp" ?
2011-04-30T15:05:20  <mcstar> not click and install
2011-04-30T15:05:34  <mcstar> thats why i asked how much do u know :)
2011-04-30T15:05:40  <jaycobcoleman> you still use python
2011-04-30T15:05:45  <jaycobcoleman> python runs the engine
2011-04-30T15:05:54  <antimatroid> MuTa_ofd00m: try just removing the python and giving the location of the bot file
2011-04-30T15:06:00  <antimatroid> is C# compiled?
2011-04-30T15:06:01  <mcstar> just use the path to the exe
2011-04-30T15:06:04  <antimatroid> that's what i do for my c++ bots
2011-04-30T15:06:14  <antimatroid> i assume it is
2011-04-30T15:07:34  <mcstar> so to wet your apetite
2011-04-30T15:07:44  <mcstar> there are lots of packages
2011-04-30T15:07:48  <jaycobcoleman> whet?
2011-04-30T15:07:55  <mcstar> wet
2011-04-30T15:08:07  <mcstar> no?
2011-04-30T15:08:09  <mcstar> wetting
2011-04-30T15:08:43  <mcstar> so in aur there are god know how many packages
2011-04-30T15:08:52  <mcstar> its a user maintained repositry
2011-04-30T15:08:56  <jaycobcoleman> you whet your appetite :P
2011-04-30T15:09:02  <jaycobcoleman> So I saw
2011-04-30T15:09:02  <mcstar> whet
2011-04-30T15:09:05  <mcstar> i dont care
2011-04-30T15:09:07  <jaycobcoleman> It's quite large
2011-04-30T15:09:08  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-30T15:09:17  <mcstar> and it a PKGBUILD file
2011-04-30T15:09:19  <mcstar> its
2011-04-30T15:09:29  <mcstar> instructions on how to build that package
2011-04-30T15:09:42  <mcstar> it downloads the source code for u
2011-04-30T15:09:46  <mcstar> configures makes
2011-04-30T15:09:50  <mcstar> anything
2011-04-30T15:09:58  <mcstar> can use bzr cvs git
2011-04-30T15:10:01  <mcstar> whateveru want
2011-04-30T15:10:07  <mcstar> its quite nice
2011-04-30T15:10:20  <mcstar> so if some package isnt officially supported
2011-04-30T15:10:36  <mcstar> theres a good chance u can find its pkgbuild in aur
2011-04-30T15:10:50  <mcstar> if you install yaourt beside pacman
2011-04-30T15:11:02  <mcstar> then its as easy as pressing enter
2011-04-30T15:11:21  <mcstar> and the offical packages are built through ABS
2011-04-30T15:11:27  <mcstar> arch build system
2011-04-30T15:11:39  <mcstar> basicall the collection af similar PKGBUILD files
2011-04-30T15:12:01  <mcstar> so if u want to recompile something u download its pkgbuild and off you go
2011-04-30T15:12:11  <mcstar> makepkg -s does everything
2011-04-30T15:12:26  *** Bugg <Bugg!63295294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.99.41.82.148> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-30T15:12:26  <mcstar> and it has bsd style init scripts
2011-04-30T15:12:44  <mcstar> not those 20daemon 40daemon2 like in ubuntu or whatever
2011-04-30T15:13:04  <mcstar> so its a breeze
2011-04-30T15:13:24  <mcstar> and u know about rolling release?
2011-04-30T15:13:42  <mcstar> u always have the latest software if you want
2011-04-30T15:13:49  <mcstar> but its not unstable
2011-04-30T15:13:52  <jaycobcoleman> yes
2011-04-30T15:14:04  <mcstar> for example i have kde 4.6.2
2011-04-30T15:14:29  <mcstar> and i messed in kde source several times
2011-04-30T15:14:45  <mcstar> and its just easy when u have a solid build system
2011-04-30T15:15:35  <mcstar> but in the end its just linux
2011-04-30T15:15:52  <mcstar> 99% the same code as almost any other distro
2011-04-30T15:16:10  <mcstar> its not like switching to bsd :)

2011-04-30T15:23:43  <jaycobcoleman> GNOME

2011-04-30T15:24:06  <mcstar> then nothing
2011-04-30T15:24:12  <jaycobcoleman> why's that?
2011-04-30T15:24:33  <mcstar> i use kde and wanted to share some tips
2011-04-30T15:25:06  <jaycobcoleman> oh, yeah, my Ubuntu install is only about a month old
2011-04-30T15:25:12  <jaycobcoleman> maybe a little more
2011-04-30T15:25:18  <jaycobcoleman> so I haven't changed much
2011-04-30T15:25:20  <mcstar> (but trying to migrate to a tiling window manager)
2011-04-30T15:25:44  <mcstar> u mean ur dealing with linux for a month?
2011-04-30T15:26:10  <jaycobcoleman> I don
2011-04-30T15:26:17  <jaycobcoleman> *'t know what you're asking
2011-04-30T15:26:35  <mcstar> since how long do u use linux?
2011-04-30T15:27:17  <jaycobcoleman> I used Ubuntu in a virtual machine on a mac for a couple weeks before that, but that's about it
2011-04-30T15:27:31  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-30T15:27:44  <mcstar> well then i wont recommend arch to u
2011-04-30T15:27:50  <mcstar> i mean try it if you want
2011-04-30T15:27:54  <mcstar> but be prepared
2011-04-30T15:27:57  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-30T15:28:47  <jaycobcoleman> :) I've spent a pretty good amount of time in terminal. I think I can manage :P
2011-04-30T15:29:03  <mcstar> alright
2011-04-30T15:31:35  <jaycobcoleman> So many issues left :(

2011-04-30T17:34:34  <janzert> IE users make up  a little under 6% of visitors to ai-contest.com. IE <= 8 is ~4.5%, <= 7 is ~1%
2011-04-30T17:35:39  <janzert> from that I would say IE8+ is probably worth supporting, IE7- may or may not depending on the effort required
2011-04-30T17:36:50  <jbroman> You mean IE >= 8, right?
2011-04-30T17:37:06  <janzert> yes, 8 plus :)
2011-04-30T17:37:56  <janzert> also of note is Opera has ~6% so should be as important to us as IE
2011-04-30T17:38:14  <janzert> and of course much easier to support

2011-04-30T17:47:26  <janzert> so far as I know the visualizer was tested on it, but I've not heard of anyone checking the new site design on it
2011-04-30T17:47:41  <janzert> doesn't mean it hasn't been done of course :)
2011-04-30T17:48:19  <janzert> just thought I'd mention that from number of users it should be at least as large a concern as IE for us

2011-04-30T18:27:25  <MuTa-ofd00m> ok so it should be right
2011-04-30T18:27:26  <mcstar> when u run it in cmd
2011-04-30T18:27:35  <mcstar> does it accept text?
2011-04-30T18:27:40  <MuTa-ofd00m> yep
2011-04-30T18:27:48  <mcstar> and it says go

2011-04-30T18:28:00  <MuTa-ofd00m> dunno, what should I write for it to say go?
2011-04-30T18:28:08  <mcstar> anything
2011-04-30T18:28:11  <mcstar> a newline
2011-04-30T18:28:22  <MuTa-ofd00m> no reply
2011-04-30T18:28:39  <mcstar> thats bad
2011-04-30T18:28:57  <mcstar> well write something
2011-04-30T18:29:04  <mcstar> not juts a newline sry
2011-04-30T18:29:12  <mcstar> still the same?
2011-04-30T18:29:25  <MuTa-ofd00m> yep
2011-04-30T18:29:38  <mcstar> then its some IO problem
2011-04-30T18:29:54  <mcstar> i cant give advice on that part
2011-04-30T18:30:02  <mcstar> only that dont forget to flush
2011-04-30T18:30:06  <mcstar> if IO id buffered
2011-04-30T18:30:08  <mcstar> is
2011-04-30T18:30:10  <janzert> the starter doesn't need a 'ready' command to signal the end of the pregame information?
2011-04-30T18:30:13  <MuTa-ofd00m> if I write 'go' it says 'go'

2011-04-30T18:36:55  <mcstar> and u dont use double quotes
2011-04-30T18:36:55  <MuTa-ofd00m> I changed it from C# to csharp
2011-04-30T18:37:10  <MuTa-ofd00m> "dist/starter_bots/csharp/CSStarterPackage/CSStarterPackage.exe
2011-04-30T18:37:15  <MuTa-ofd00m> there's an " after it

2011-04-30T18:37:59  <MuTa-ofd00m> I forgot bin/release/
2011-04-30T18:38:01  <MuTa-ofd00m> in the dir!
2011-04-30T18:38:09  <MuTa-ofd00m> it works now, jezz my bad >.<
2011-04-30T18:38:13  <mcstar> lol
2011-04-30T18:38:20  <mcstar> alright
2011-04-30T18:41:34  <MuTa-ofd00m> well it works and it runs the code, but the bot does nothing, getting closer at least :P
2011-04-30T18:50:15  <mcstar> i think it a north bot
2011-04-30T18:50:18  <mcstar> isnt it?
2011-04-30T18:50:37  <MuTa-ofd00m> nope it's moving towards closest food, else closest enemy
2011-04-30T18:50:40  <mcstar> the rule is that it goest N if it can otherwise stay put
2011-04-30T18:51:09  <MuTa-ofd00m> it spawns with no water around it, and it does nothing
2011-04-30T18:51:24  <mcstar> well at least there is some room for imporvement
2011-04-30T18:51:48  <MuTa-ofd00m> I cant get it to do anything, the game engine says that the bot times out
2011-04-30T18:51:53  <MuTa-ofd00m> so I think it forgets to reply some info
2011-04-30T18:52:08  <mcstar> compare it with the cpp bot
2011-04-30T18:52:09  <MuTa-ofd00m> "bot 9 timed out"
2011-04-30T18:52:19  <MuTa-ofd00m> yeah good idea
2011-04-30T18:56:11  <MuTa-ofd00m> no luck, they're quite different
2011-04-30T19:00:28  <MuTa-ofd00m> mmmmm imma give up for now, I dont think the starterpackage has been developed enough
