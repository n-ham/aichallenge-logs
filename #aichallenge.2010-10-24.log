2010-10-24T00:12:30  <jkl__> If you are using server-side cursors, it is very important to close the cursor when you are done with it and before creating a new one.
2010-10-24T00:12:55  <jkl__> You might get away with waiting for GC, and you might not.
2010-10-24T00:13:06  <amstan> there's a lot of things that the mysqldb implementation skips over

2010-10-24T00:44:40  <Mathnerd314> so there are really only 198 turns of the game!
2010-10-24T00:45:00  <janzert> well and since we know the last two turns should do nothing we can keep backing it up
2010-10-24T00:46:06  <Mathnerd314> no... because you can take a planet with 0 population, losing growth ships, and gain 2*growth back
2010-10-24T00:46:46  <Mathnerd314> so I'll have to revise: on turn 199, you can take neutral planets distance 1 away with population less than their growth
2010-10-24T00:46:48  <antimatroid> well actually, you can check whether a move will payoff in time
2010-10-24T00:46:51  <antimatroid> and it's not constant
2010-10-24T00:47:09  <janzert> sorry if I wasn't obvious I was just trying to extend it 'logically' to absurdity
2010-10-24T00:47:17  <janzert> but yes your point seems correct
2010-10-24T00:47:46  <Mathnerd314> janzert: obviously, and whenever I notice that, I always take it literally :p
2010-10-24T00:48:14  *** iNtERrUpT <iNtERrUpT!~interrupt@61.43.139.4> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-24T00:49:32  <Mathnerd314> so, on turn 198, what are the possible moves?
2010-10-24T00:49:52  <Mathnerd314> distance 2 planets or farther are pointless, as before
2010-10-24T00:49:59  <amstan> anyone here worked with the cpython api? do you know how to use PyFile_FromFile?
2010-10-24T00:50:55  <janzert> only minimally with the api and it's been a few years and I don't recall that part no :/
2010-10-24T00:51:31  <amstan> i can't figure out what the other parameters are used for
2010-10-24T00:51:53  <amstan> i have the FILE* variable, but idk about others
2010-10-24T00:52:08  <amstan> i set them to something kinda descriptive for now, but i can't figure out what the last one does
2010-10-24T00:52:12  <amstan> docs seem limited
2010-10-24T00:52:46  <janzert> yeah, I quickly found going to the source code itself was about the only way to actually work with the api
2010-10-24T00:53:00  <janzert> not sure how much the docs have improved since then
2010-10-24T00:53:01  <amstan> janzert: what source code?
2010-10-24T00:53:07  <janzert> cpython source
2010-10-24T00:53:22  <amstan> the only thing about that function in the docs is: Create a new PyFileObject from the already-open standard C file pointer, fp. The function close will be called when the file should be closed. Return NULL on failure.
2010-10-24T00:53:34  <amstan> prototype: PyObject* PyFile_FromFile(FILE *fp, char *name, char *mode, int (*close)(FILE*))
2010-10-24T00:53:46  <amstan> what does int (*close)(FILE*) do??
2010-10-24T00:53:47  <amstan> lol
2010-10-24T00:54:12  <janzert> :) looks like it's a function pointer to a function that is suppose to close the file
2010-10-24T00:54:27  <amstan> hmm
2010-10-24T00:55:13  <janzert> in other words a callback function
2010-10-24T00:55:45  <amstan> janzert: can i make it do nothing?
2010-10-24T00:55:55  <amstan> is it a good idea to put a NULL there?
2010-10-24T00:56:04  <janzert> sure but you may leak your file descriptor then
2010-10-24T00:56:16  <janzert> at least that's what I would guess
2010-10-24T00:56:23  <amstan> that's fine, i'm just trying to tap into it, i'm not managing it
2010-10-24T00:56:27  <janzert> not sure if it would handle NULL correctly or not
2010-10-24T00:56:38  <janzert> go look at the source :)
2010-10-24T00:57:00  <amstan> well.. what happens if you call a function pointed at NULL?
2010-10-24T00:57:07  <janzert> segfault
2010-10-24T00:57:26  <jkl__> You now have two _totally untested_ patches for 199.  I resisted the urge to rewrite the DB code, so I just added another statement to insert the errors.
2010-10-24T00:57:38  <janzert> :P ok
2010-10-24T00:58:08  <amstan> janzert: sigh.. if i put NULL it'll segfault, if python decides to close it for whatever reason and i try to write to it, segfault, give me a break, lol
2010-10-24T00:58:10  <janzert> I gotta take a break here as soon as I get this fix I'm working on commited
2010-10-24T00:58:30  <janzert> but then I'll try and take a look at it jkl__
2010-10-24T00:58:50  <Mathnerd314> hmm... I'm skipping over stuff. turn 199 is more complicated than just neutrals.
2010-10-24T00:59:09  <janzert> amstan: :}
2010-10-24T00:59:19  <jkl__> All I did was port error handling from the cloud engine and port the SQL from api_record_game.php
2010-10-24T00:59:40  <janzert> python might check for null and not try to call it of course, but the source is about the only way to check that out
2010-10-24T01:00:27  <amstan> oh well
2010-10-24T01:00:35  <amstan> if i get segfaults, i'll know why.. lol
2010-10-24T01:00:37  <jkl__> I emphasize the patches are untested.  Since I cannot meaningfully test them I kept them to the absolute minimum required to fix 199.
2010-10-24T01:01:18  <janzert> yep, I'll test them locally here

2010-10-24T02:58:04  <Zalma> Hi.. anyone here who could help a newbie a bit. I'm not really familiar with object-oriented programming...
2010-10-24T02:59:33  <Zalma> for example in c++ starter package there is used p.NumShips()... is p integer what points what planet?
2010-10-24T03:00:12  <amstan> Zalma: no, p is a planet object
2010-10-24T03:00:31  <amstan> and numships is a function of that object
2010-10-24T03:00:31  <Zalma> Mmm.. mkay
2010-10-24T03:00:47  <Zalma> yea that is what I understood thou
2010-10-24T03:01:02  <amstan> so.. if you have an integer, and you want the planet with that integer as the id..
2010-10-24T03:01:04  <amstan> hmm
2010-10-24T03:01:19  * amstan downloads the code
2010-10-24T03:01:54  <Zalma> There should be starter packages for idiots :P
2010-10-24T03:02:12  <Zalma> Thou one reason I decided to do this is to learn
2010-10-24T03:02:34  <amstan> Zalma: well.. what are you trying to do?
2010-10-24T03:03:02  <Zalma> Well for first I'm trying to understand how these objects work so I could make some calculations..
2010-10-24T03:03:20  <amstan> so.. you have the Planet object
2010-10-24T03:03:41  <Zalma> but lets say I would like to get fleet amount in planet 2 to variable b...
2010-10-24T03:03:53  <amstan> so..
2010-10-24T03:04:00  <amstan> what?
2010-10-24T03:04:06  <raedwulf> meh, i need to get a piece of paper to scribble out my AI :/
2010-10-24T03:04:06  <amstan> you want to know how many ships are on planet 2?
2010-10-24T03:04:12  <Zalma> yes
2010-10-24T03:05:07  <amstan> Zalma: define planet 2 though
2010-10-24T03:05:14  <amstan> hold on
2010-10-24T03:05:18  <amstan> let's just go to basics
2010-10-24T03:05:22  <amstan> you have a planet object
2010-10-24T03:05:29  <Zalma> I mean planet with ID 2
2010-10-24T03:05:30  <amstan> let p be that object
2010-10-24T03:05:35  <amstan> this represents just one planet
2010-10-24T03:05:49  <amstan> you can do p.PlanetID() to get its ID
2010-10-24T03:06:01  <amstan> p.Owner(), p.NumShips()
2010-10-24T03:06:24  <amstan> once you have that p, you can find any piece of detail about it
2010-10-24T03:06:28  <amstan> now.. you need p with the id 2
2010-10-24T03:07:17  <Zalma> Mkay
2010-10-24T03:07:45  <amstan> then you have this planetwars object
2010-10-24T03:07:49  <amstan> you only have one of those..
2010-10-24T03:07:59  <amstan> the instance is called pw
2010-10-24T03:08:14  <amstan> so. pw.Planets() returns you a list of planets, a list of those planet objects
2010-10-24T03:08:27  <amstan> you can iterate through them, check their id, check their size
2010-10-24T03:08:28  <amstan> and all that
2010-10-24T03:08:52  <amstan> Zalma: look at PlanetWars.h, it's the prototypes for all these objects and some extensive documentation
2010-10-24T03:09:39  <Zalma> The thing is I'm trying to do planet maps  on my own without using much those objects at all. Getting all information I need for arrays and no need to call for functions
2010-10-24T03:10:11  <amstan> Zalma: ideally you should use those objects
2010-10-24T03:10:19  <amstan> Zalma: it's poor form to do your own thing..
2010-10-24T03:10:31  <amstan> Zalma: if you really want, you could write your own IO library, in C
2010-10-24T03:10:41  <amstan> Zalma: and have it manage the planets as you want
2010-10-24T03:10:53  <Zalma> The thing I chose C++ is that you don't need to use objects :/
2010-10-24T03:11:17  <amstan> c++ is object oriented..
2010-10-24T03:11:28  <amstan> C is what you're looking for if you don't want objects

2010-10-24T03:11:36  <amstan> however, i don't think we have a c starter package
2010-10-24T03:11:37  <Zalma> well C++ is also functional language
2010-10-24T03:11:50  <amstan> or any non object oriented starter package for that matter
2010-10-24T03:12:04  <amstan> Zalma: yes, but the started package is very object oriented
2010-10-24T03:12:13  <Zalma> Yea I know..
2010-10-24T03:12:22  <Zannick> imperative, you mean, not functional
2010-10-24T03:12:27  <Zannick> functional is a whole different class
2010-10-24T03:13:18  <amstan> what's the worst that can happen if i have a open("/tmp/%s.ogz" % (name)), where name is an unsanitized string from the user?
2010-10-24T03:13:53  <Zannick> um...
2010-10-24T03:13:57  <Zalma> Problem is I have whole bunch of ideas what to program.. but no skill to implement them =(

2010-10-24T03:14:16  <Zannick> i think it'll just fail on trying to open a ridiculous filename
2010-10-24T03:14:37  <amstan> Zannick: you can have name=../etc/passwd
2010-10-24T03:14:42  <amstan> but it'll still append .ogz
2010-10-24T03:15:11  <janzert> you can include a null in your string
2010-10-24T03:15:18  <Zannick> oh, i was thinking more if it could lead to arbitrary code
2010-10-24T03:15:33  <janzert> since that looks like python it can depending on the origin
2010-10-24T03:15:51  <amstan> janzert: irc, or c string
2010-10-24T03:16:02  <Zannick> if there's a null in name i don't know
2010-10-24T03:16:06  <Error323> Hooooooooooowdydo
2010-10-24T03:16:09  <amstan> well.. anyway, i don't intend to leave it like that
2010-10-24T03:16:12  <Error323> or, good morning
2010-10-24T03:16:15  <amstan> i just want to know if i'm safe till tomorrow
2010-10-24T03:16:15  <Zannick> i don't think it'll be arbitrary code execution
2010-10-24T03:16:28  <janzert> the underlying os open call will stop reading the name at the null I'm pretty sure
2010-10-24T03:16:41  <janzert> if so can open an arbitrary file then
2010-10-24T03:17:07  <Zannick> well, would the null be inserted?
2010-10-24T03:17:09  <raedwulf> quickly sanitise it by removing all ".."
2010-10-24T03:17:21  <Zannick> if name is "123\0456" would it not open "123.ogz"?
2010-10-24T03:17:35  <Zannick> iow would python stop at the null?
2010-10-24T03:17:40  <janzert> nope
2010-10-24T03:17:44  <amstan> Zannick: how do you insert \0 on irc though?
2010-10-24T03:17:44  <Zannick> hm
2010-10-24T03:17:57  <amstan> since though c string you clearly can't
2010-10-24T03:18:07  <Zannick> on irc?
2010-10-24T03:18:15  <amstan> yeah
2010-10-24T03:18:18  <Zannick> i don't know what you mean
2010-10-24T03:18:28  <amstan> Zannick: you know.. this thing we're talking on right now
2010-10-24T03:18:31  <janzert> the string is coming from irc chat I assume
2010-10-24T03:18:38  <amstan> janzert: yes
2010-10-24T03:18:41  <Zannick> oh, hm.
2010-10-24T03:18:51  <janzert> in a unicode character?
2010-10-24T03:18:53  <Zannick> i wouldn't trust that it couldn't be done
2010-10-24T03:18:59  <raedwulf> i think it depends on the irc client and server

2010-10-24T03:19:20  <janzert> yeah, it would depend on a lot of specifics
2010-10-24T03:19:49  <raedwulf> yep -- you'd probably have ot have a hacked client or direct protocol manipulation
2010-10-24T03:19:52  <raedwulf> to make it possible
2010-10-24T03:20:16  <raedwulf> just simply replace instances of ".." with "  "

2010-10-24T03:21:41  <Zannick> so this is what i did:

2010-10-24T03:22:26  <janzert> ahh, so python is filtering it before sending it off to the os anyway
2010-10-24T03:22:37  <Zannick> "print s" gives abcd
2010-10-24T03:22:47  <Zannick> "print repr(s)" gives "ab\x00cd"
2010-10-24T03:23:09  <Zannick> and "with open("%s" % s, "w") as f:" raises the TypeError on the open
2010-10-24T03:24:45  <Zannick> Zalma: my_planets = pw.MyPlanets(); doesn't add anything to my_planets, it replaces it entirely with the results from pw.MyPlanets()
2010-10-24T03:25:07  <Zannick> Zalma: and the indices will be [0] through [n - 1], when you have n planets.

2010-10-24T03:43:25  <Zalma> If u don't mind to answer to stupid question again in p.NumShips()  numships is class and p is instance of that class?
2010-10-24T03:44:16  <janzert> p is the instance of a class (don't know what it's named the cpp package probable Planet) and NumShips is the class method
2010-10-24T03:44:58  <Zalma> Okies.. I guess I'm now on to something ;)
2010-10-24T03:45:22  <janzert> you should be able to find the class definition showing what all it contains in the PlanetWars.h file
2010-10-24T03:45:48  <Zalma> I have next week meeting in work with few IT nerds.. maybe they can help me too if I don't figure this out :)
2010-10-24T03:46:17  <janzert> err, s/definition/declaration
2010-10-24T03:47:45  <Zalma> its prolly this // Initializes a planet.   Planet(int planet_id, etc
2010-10-24T03:49:45  <janzert> line 73: class Planet {
2010-10-24T03:49:54  <janzert> is the start of the declaration
2010-10-24T03:50:05  <Zalma> btw another thing that been wondering.. why is it p.Numships and not Planet.NumShips? =)
2010-10-24T03:50:17  <Zalma> like its declared..
2010-10-24T03:50:18  <janzert> but yes, I see where your line now that is the right area
2010-10-24T03:50:40  <janzert> Planet is the class name not the instance of that class
2010-10-24T03:50:59  <Zalma> ah.. yes
2010-10-24T03:51:42  <janzert> line 25 in MyBot.cc is assigning the instance in the my_planets vector to p
2010-10-24T03:52:05  <janzert> the same thing is done on line 38
2010-10-24T03:52:58  <janzert> btw, you might have an easier time picking up object oriented programming with java or python
2010-10-24T03:53:14  <janzert> they're just a little easier to work with the C++ straight off
2010-10-24T03:53:26  <janzert> than C++ that is
2010-10-24T03:53:37  <Zalma> How about C#?
2010-10-24T03:53:43  <janzert> it's too late I can't type straight anymore :P
2010-10-24T03:54:13  <janzert> I've never worked with C# but it's pretty certainly easier than c++ as well
2010-10-24T03:54:36  <janzert> since I believe it's fairly similar to java
2010-10-24T03:55:02  <Zalma> one good thins in C++ u don't need to define for example arrays as objects too
2010-10-24T03:55:14  <Zalma> thats the reason I chose it..
2010-10-24T03:55:48  <Zalma> with c++ u should be able to do program without any objects if I'm correct..
2010-10-24T03:55:52  <janzert> well yes C++ isn't OO only like java more or less is
2010-10-24T03:56:04  <antimatroid> i use structs in c++ to simlify things a lot
2010-10-24T03:56:11  <antimatroid> but i also have quite a few 4d vectors etc.
2010-10-24T03:56:56  <Zalma> All I need is to get information about planets to my arrays so I could start doing my bot
2010-10-24T03:57:23  <Zalma> and I'm not going to use any objects after that.. :P
2010-10-24T03:58:27  <janzert> honestly if you can do a whole lot else in C++ or even just C the objects shouldn't be too hard to figure out
2010-10-24T03:58:51  <janzert> just look at a tutorial or two on them from a web search
2010-10-24T03:59:05  <Zalma> Yea I've been reading a lot..
2010-10-24T03:59:27  <Zalma> but whole consept of objects isn't familiar to me so its not that easy
2010-10-24T04:00:00  <janzert> think of them like structs that have functions :)
2010-10-24T04:01:56  <Zalma> would u be so kind to write me a example code that would tell number of ships in planet with id 2? =)
2010-10-24T04:02:37  <Zalma> Reading theory have been always a bit hard for me.. understanding from simple example makes it a lot easier
2010-10-24T04:02:59  <janzert> pw.GetPlanet(2).NumShips()
2010-10-24T04:03:28  <amstan> this should fix my security problem, right? http://github.com/amstan/hyperserv/commit/02d70871c4b7dc7d7f3812860b3e7067039a9dab
2010-10-24T04:03:30  <janzert> untested and just from looking at PlanetWars.h but that should do it :)
2010-10-24T04:04:29  <Zalma> oh... cool
2010-10-24T04:04:54  <Zalma> so if there is integer x =pw.GetPlanet(2).NumShips()  it would get the fleet amount?
2010-10-24T04:05:31  <janzert> yes int x = pw.GetPlanet(2).NumShips(); should leave x with the number of ships on planet 2
2010-10-24T04:05:55  <Zalma> Thank you a lot
2010-10-24T04:06:02  <Zalma> that makes a lot more sense

2010-10-24T04:15:00  <Zalma> pw when they are under class PlanetWars?
2010-10-24T04:15:52  <janzert> pw and p are just variable names of course you can call them whatever you want
2010-10-24T04:16:06  <janzert> in the case of the starter bot in the DoTurn function
2010-10-24T04:16:26  <janzert> pw is the name of the PlanetWars object passed in as an argument
2010-10-24T04:16:41  <Zalma> ah.. so I can call them what ever I want :)
2010-10-24T04:16:45  <janzert> and p is used a couple of times for a variable for Planet objects
2010-10-24T04:17:10  <janzert> just like source is used for an int variable
2010-10-24T04:17:31  <janzert> int source = -1; << int variable
2010-10-24T04:17:57  <janzert> const Planet& p ... << type of Planet object variable
2010-10-24T04:18:09  <janzert> specifically a const reference
2010-10-24T04:18:22  <janzert> the const and & act the same as in C
2010-10-24T04:18:33  <Zalma> ok

2010-10-24T04:20:43  <Zalma> since I need to coordinate with IT coders there..
2010-10-24T04:21:04  <Zalma> atleast to get some insight what they are doing..
2010-10-24T04:22:04  <janzert> just the concepts will be easier to pick up elsewhere without all of the C++ complexity and then transfer them back to C++ will be much easier, but anyway I gotta go so good luck
2010-10-24T04:22:42  <antimatroid> i found c++ easier than other languages
2010-10-24T04:22:45  <antimatroid> it's certainly easier than c
2010-10-24T04:23:03  <antimatroid> the only time i ever have to delete anything is when i make trees
2010-10-24T04:23:06  <janzert> ? it's C + other stuff

2010-10-24T04:23:38  * Zalma like vectors
2010-10-24T04:23:51  <janzert> ahh, well it does help a little more with memory management than C
2010-10-24T04:24:04  <antimatroid> a little? :P
2010-10-24T04:24:17  <janzert> go to a *real* high level language :)
2010-10-24T04:24:25  <antimatroid> i will learn haskell soon
2010-10-24T04:24:48  <janzert> C++ is much closer to C in memory management than it is to fully GC'd language
2010-10-24T04:24:49  <Zalma> btw.. why ppl call multidiensional arrays/matrixes still as vectors? =)
2010-10-24T04:24:56  <Zalma> *dimensonal
2010-10-24T04:25:06  <antimatroid> they are vectors

2010-10-24T04:25:16  * janzert is really out now :)
2010-10-24T04:25:20  <Zalma> well vectors are really always 1 dimensional :P
2010-10-24T04:25:41  <antimatroid> i have a c++ struct that does nd tensors which puts it all into a 1d vector
2010-10-24T04:26:24  <antimatroid> i have 2 complaints about c++
2010-10-24T04:26:24  <antimatroid> 1. i can't overload operator precedence
2010-10-24T04:26:24  <antimatroid> 2. i can't write functions for nd vectors arbitrarily
2010-10-24T04:26:56  <Zalma> Well I have no idea what that means :)
2010-10-24T04:27:17  <antimatroid> operator precedence is the order the operations are performed with say 2*3^6
2010-10-24T04:27:36  <antimatroid> or put matrices in there, i can't overload ^ precendence to avoid () in lines
2010-10-24T04:28:14  <antimatroid> and nd vector is like say i want a "tensor" class, where the input parameter defines the number of dimensions, i can't do that without writing my own class

2010-10-24T04:32:00  <Zalma> I mean compulsory math courses..
2010-10-24T04:32:08  <antimatroid> maths gets interesting once you get to uni
2010-10-24T04:32:17  <Zalma> I am in university :P
2010-10-24T04:32:32  <antimatroid> past the first two years of calculus anyway :P
2010-10-24T04:32:35  <Zalma> doing my master thesis at the moment
2010-10-24T04:32:43  <antimatroid> ah okay
2010-10-24T04:32:51  <antimatroid> what's to hate about maths?
2010-10-24T04:32:56  <antimatroid> it's wonderful
2010-10-24T04:33:38  <Zalma> well I'm engineer.. pure theoretical math is too utopistic..
2010-10-24T04:33:54  <Zalma> all the integrating makes my head hurt
2010-10-24T04:34:11  <antimatroid> measure theory makes my head hurt
2010-10-24T04:34:40  <antimatroid> and this godamn game
2010-10-24T04:34:46  <antimatroid> it's impenetrable i swear
2010-10-24T04:35:00  <Zalma> btw I'm not studying IT or enything like that anyway... studying energy/powerplant technology
2010-10-24T04:36:29  <Zalma> only place where you would need high match skill would be computational science in there.. like doing cfd
2010-10-24T04:36:41  <Zalma> match=math
2010-10-24T04:37:18  <antimatroid> i graduate in a month with majors in cs, economics and pure maths, i very much intend to use maths my whole life :P
2010-10-24T04:37:31  <antimatroid> i'm going onto to do post grad maths next year
2010-10-24T04:37:37  <antimatroid> onto == on
2010-10-24T04:38:12  <antimatroid> that's if i ever get around to studying for my exams
2010-10-24T04:38:24  <antimatroid> i have an exam tuesday and i haven't been to a class since first week or started studying
2010-10-24T04:38:25  <antimatroid> meh
2010-10-24T04:38:43  <antimatroid> one day study dates have been performed before

2010-10-24T04:39:02  <Zalma> the biggest problem is that I need to understand what all operations etc means and how they refer to real life..
2010-10-24T04:39:14  <Zalma> because of that math is quite difficult for me
2010-10-24T04:39:29  <Zalma> since they always don't have good reference in real life..
2010-10-24T04:39:39  <antimatroid> they do, they just aren't given
2010-10-24T04:40:13  <Zalma> I mean the way how human mind can understand them.. atleast engineers mind :P
2010-10-24T04:40:49  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm rewriting a new heuristic bot
2010-10-24T04:40:54  <antimatroid> i was way too premature at making a tree
2010-10-24T04:41:32  <Zalma> Well if I get on the way I may try to use some evolutionary algorithm :P
2010-10-24T04:41:57  <antimatroid> i'm considering throwing out moves from the other player entirely
2010-10-24T04:42:04  <antimatroid> it's way too messy to coordinate that and future moves
2010-10-24T04:42:10  <antimatroid> and one needs to consider future moves
2010-10-24T04:43:52  <Zalma> I'm also considering to use some randome element and probability mathematics
2010-10-24T04:44:09  <Zalma> that mathematics area isn't so hard :)
2010-10-24T04:45:11  <Zalma> for that I would need a lot of data collected first thou
2010-10-24T04:45:36  <antimatroid> the problem is incredibly hard
2010-10-24T04:45:42  <antimatroid> i've been thinking about it for a good month now
2010-10-24T04:45:57  <antimatroid> there's sooo much information that feeds into everytihng else
2010-10-24T04:46:21  <Zalma> yea :)
2010-10-24T04:46:43  <Zalma> thats always problem for game AI :P
2010-10-24T04:51:32  <Zalma> btw r u using windows or unix based system?
2010-10-24T04:51:41  <antimatroid> windows
2010-10-24T04:52:07  <Zalma> what do u use to compile your bot?
2010-10-24T04:55:13  <Zalma> since I haven't compiled my project yet at all just tryed to figure out all sorts of things.. I'm not really familiar to these windows based IDEs.. back in school days we used dos based borland =P
2010-10-24T04:55:56  <Zalma> I'm using currenly visual studio 2010 since I get it free from dreamspark

2010-10-24T05:00:11  <lavalamp_> My minimax bot does 20k nodes/sec... now if only they were good nodes... :(
2010-10-24T05:04:16  <Zalma> maybe I try that codeblocks..
2010-10-24T05:05:02  <Zalma> only if I could download it... too many clients =E
2010-10-24T05:09:33  <Zalma> to compile the bot I need to first make them as project right?

2010-10-24T10:14:50  <Lithosphere> the forum posts have to be manually converted by someone, but indeed, it has been a long time since I posted too, and it isn't updated
2010-10-24T10:15:51  <irchs> ah I thought they had a script scanning it or something....
2010-10-24T10:16:08  <irchs> because of the specific format requirements
2010-10-24T10:20:37  <Zalma> btw does player home planets have some standard ID for example 1 &2?
2010-10-24T10:20:49  <Zalma> or they are just random
2010-10-24T10:22:25  <Lithosphere> when generated by the python script they are, but I should not make assumptions they will always be like that

2010-10-24T10:33:22  <bhasker> maybe you have a extra ship in flight or something?
2010-10-24T10:34:05  <bhasker> actually i think i shold have that one

2010-10-24T10:34:11  <Spike_007> hi all
2010-10-24T10:34:37  <bhasker> and in fact hmm you lost a planet too
2010-10-24T10:34:50  <bhasker> weird
2010-10-24T10:34:59  <bhasker> at Turn 7
2010-10-24T10:35:01  <bhasker> i have 4 planets
2010-10-24T10:35:03  <bhasker> you have 3
2010-10-24T10:35:09  <bhasker> i should be ahead by a few ships
2010-10-24T10:35:38  <bhasker> and at turn 19 you lose your planet too
2010-10-24T10:35:39  <bhasker> for one turn
2010-10-24T10:35:40  <bhasker> weird
2010-10-24T10:36:13  <Error323> at the end we have an equal amount of ships
2010-10-24T10:36:19  <Error323> thats all that matters
2010-10-24T10:37:40  <bhasker> but i don't understand how that is possible
2010-10-24T10:37:44  <bhasker> we have identical growth rates
2010-10-24T10:37:50  <bhasker> and i got the planets before you did
2010-10-24T10:37:55  <bhasker> so technically i should be ahead
2010-10-24T10:38:10  <bhasker> since i never lose control of my planets

2010-10-24T10:40:51  <bhasker> i take two planets

2010-10-24T10:41:00  <bhasker> you take another one at turn 8
2010-10-24T10:41:05  <bhasker> so i should be ahead in ships

2010-10-24T10:41:34  <bhasker> doh
2010-10-24T10:41:38  <bhasker> i took a 61 ship planet
2010-10-24T10:41:41  <bhasker> you took a 34

2010-10-24T11:36:51  <antimatroid> in my simulated game
2010-10-24T11:36:58  <antimatroid> it's damn near impossible to do it i swear

2010-10-24T11:39:22  <mega1> antimatroid: I considered it, but there is much invalidation of moves and reconsidering to do.
2010-10-24T11:39:40  <mega1> A future move is just a plan, nothing more.
2010-10-24T11:40:02  <mega1> You can't do meaningful search having to go back and forth in time.
2010-10-24T11:40:14  <jklandis> A future move also involves reserving ships in the present.
2010-10-24T11:40:31  <mega1> At least not when the dependencies are like in this game.
2010-10-24T11:40:36  <jklandis> Additionally, in order to send ships, you have to own the planet
2010-10-24T11:42:41  <jklandis> It's not enough just to have the ships there
2010-10-24T11:42:55  <mega1> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistuinguisable from magic but george's bot certainly looks like it searches the game tree.
2010-10-24T11:43:46  <antimatroid> mega1: so you aren't even considering if you have a better move next turn?

2010-10-24T11:57:11  <Error323> it means you are doing sth wrong ;-)
2010-10-24T11:57:18  <Zalma> or rly
2010-10-24T11:57:55  <Zalma> I mean does it mean I'm trying to attack to planet that doesn't excist or someting?
2010-10-24T11:58:43  <rabidus_> or sending too many fleets or sending from planet what you don't own
2010-10-24T11:58:46  <rebelxt_> Zalma you might be trying to send more ships that your planet has, or trying to send ships from enemy planet
2010-10-24T11:58:59  <rabidus_> or neutral
2010-10-24T11:59:01  <Zalma> it seems it always happens when I'm going to capture my 4th or 5th planet
2010-10-24T11:59:24  <janzert> or even plain sending something out stdout that just can't be parsed
2010-10-24T11:59:24  <rebelxt_> just print out every fleet your bot is trying to send (source planet, target, number of ships), and you will see invalid order
2010-10-24T11:59:56  <antimatroid> Zalma: make sure you correctly update the number of ships you have at your planets when you make a move

2010-10-24T12:11:38  <janzert> http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt ?
2010-10-24T12:11:48  <janzert> just a place you can upload game data to
2010-10-24T12:11:52  <jklandis> My theory is that thread/process scheduling, together with polling overhead, is causing it.
2010-10-24T12:12:30  <janzert> jklandis: you're implementing the process listed in your last comment?
2010-10-24T12:12:36  <jklandis> no
2010-10-24T12:12:59  <janzert> ok, just switching to a pure select based wait?
2010-10-24T12:13:04  <jklandis> yes
2010-10-24T12:13:11  <jklandis> no polling
2010-10-24T12:13:17  <jklandis> select with timeout
2010-10-24T12:13:21  <janzert> yeah, ok
2010-10-24T12:14:21  <janzert> I really think keeping the blocking I/O and having the i/o threads set an event back to the main thread is the best way to go, but I would probably accept a select based method too
2010-10-24T12:14:38  <janzert> just have to test it a little more thoroughly
2010-10-24T12:14:44  *** irchs <irchs!~Jan@94-194-33-168.zone8.bethere.co.uk> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-24T12:14:46  <jklandis> I thought about threads, and it just makes scheduling problems worse
2010-10-24T12:14:56  <jklandis> You can't just sleep and hope things get scheduled
2010-10-24T12:15:08  <janzert> you don't have to sleep
2010-10-24T12:15:28  <jklandis> So you have worker threads dumping lines into a queue
2010-10-24T12:15:32  <janzert> the io threads stay blocked reading input and the main thread blocks waiting for threading.Event
2010-10-24T12:15:49  <janzert> like they do now if I'm remembering correctly
2010-10-24T12:16:10  <jklandis> Right now each bot gets a reader thread
2010-10-24T12:16:18  <janzert> yep
2010-10-24T12:16:20  <jklandis> and it dumps output into a separate queue
2010-10-24T12:16:24  <janzert> stays the same

2010-10-24T12:16:47  <janzert> actually combining to one queue is probably simpler
2010-10-24T12:16:49  <jklandis> what should happen under the threaded design is that they use the same queue
2010-10-24T12:16:52  <jklandis> right
2010-10-24T12:17:23  <jklandis> otherwise threading doesn't actually solve the multiplexing problem
2010-10-24T12:17:30  <jklandis> it just moves it

2010-10-24T12:17:58  <janzert> and actually if you use one queue the main thread can just wait on the queue no event needed

2010-10-24T12:18:26  <jklandis> I would hope Python would provide a thread-safe queue for this kind of ting
2010-10-24T12:18:36  <janzert> yes,
2010-10-24T12:18:40  <jklandis> where removing blocks until something is added
2010-10-24T12:18:44  <janzert> look at the Queue module
2010-10-24T12:18:51  <jklandis> That's what is being used now
2010-10-24T12:19:01  <janzert> and it's thread safe?
2010-10-24T12:19:04  <janzert> err no ?
2010-10-24T12:19:12  <janzert> s/?/!
2010-10-24T12:19:28  <jklandis> says synchronized in the docs
2010-10-24T12:19:49  <jklandis> " It is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be exchanged safely between multiple threads"
2010-10-24T12:20:12  <janzert> which is thread safe, it's not an non-locking design but is thread safe

2010-10-24T12:20:51  *** Tobu <Tobu!~Tobu@unaffiliated/tobu> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-10-24T12:20:57  <jklandis> select only works on pipes on Unix
2010-10-24T12:21:07  <jklandis> it's socket-only on Windows
2010-10-24T12:21:13  <janzert> right
2010-10-24T12:21:15  <jklandis> so a select-based approach wouldn't be portable
2010-10-24T12:21:23  <janzert> that is one reason I'd like to stay away from select
2010-10-24T12:21:30  <jklandis> Anything else?
2010-10-24T12:21:49  <janzert> it's also been known to have a fair number of bugs on many different *nix's in the past
2010-10-24T12:22:01  <janzert> although it should be fairly safe on linux now I believe
2010-10-24T12:23:12  <janzert> anyway gotta run for probably 8+ hours, thanks for working on this
2010-10-24T12:23:12  <jklandis> OK, I'm convinced

2010-10-24T13:03:43  <rebelxt> hi
2010-10-24T13:04:26  <toodlebug> ah... I wasn't sure if anyone was here.....
2010-10-24T13:04:51  <toodlebug> alot of names but no text scrolling by.....
2010-10-24T13:05:16  <rebelxt> we are here ;-)
2010-10-24T13:05:33  <rebelxt> just quiet sometimes
2010-10-24T13:06:15  <toodlebug> Im a noob programer seeking  help to add a field to the planet class,
2010-10-24T13:07:22  <toodlebug> I tried creating a subclass "PlanetX", with the extra field "flag"
2010-10-24T13:08:28  <toodlebug> I get incompatable type error when compiling MyBot
2010-10-24T13:08:56  <rebelxt> you could modify planet class directly.. or just keep additional state outside of planet class in your bot's class
2010-10-24T13:09:03  <toodlebug> can this be done...? or am I spinning my wheels...??
2010-10-24T13:09:27  <rebelxt> can be done of course
2010-10-24T13:10:10  <toodlebug> thanks I try to mod the planet class...
2010-10-24T13:11:00  <rebelxt> if you just want to maintain a flag associated with each planet, you could have a map in your bot's main class (i.e. map planet id to flag value). this is probably the easiest alternative

2010-10-24T13:12:58  <rebelxt> what language are you using btw?
2010-10-24T13:13:09  <toodlebug> Hmm... ok , so I create a array using my planet ID.... ( java)
2010-10-24T13:13:41  <rebelxt> in Java you could use a HashMap
2010-10-24T13:15:02  <toodlebug> I havnt read up on hash... yet Im guessing its like a "perl" style hase
2010-10-24T13:15:06  <toodlebug> hash
2010-10-24T13:16:18  <rebelxt> map is a key-value dictionary. very fast at looking up values by key
2010-10-24T13:16:29  <rebelxt> google HashMap - you will see some good examples
2010-10-24T13:17:08  <toodlebug> looking at it now.... thanks

2010-10-24T15:33:48  <rebelxt> was a good game.. i got lucky grabbing that center planet when you could not snipe it
2010-10-24T15:35:53  <mega1> in b0.22 (the version on the official server) sniping is a weakness
2010-10-24T15:36:08  <mega1> both ways.

2010-10-24T15:40:15  <jklandis> I think I have narrowed down 202 -- the first-turn timeout problem
2010-10-24T15:40:26  <jklandis> It looks like it has to do with ssh
2010-10-24T15:40:55  <jklandis> in user_sadbox.py
2010-10-24T15:41:55  <jklandis> The bot is blocked on pipe_wait
2010-10-24T15:42:18  <jklandis> and the ssh input end is blocked on unix_stream_data_wait
2010-10-24T15:42:37  <jklandis> So either Python or SSH is buffering the input and it's not getting through
2010-10-24T15:43:24  <jklandis> I don't see the problem if I run the ssh command directly on the console
2010-10-24T15:48:24  <p4p4> user_sadbox, that's nice..
2010-10-24T15:54:50  <jklandis> I think what happens is that if SSH thinks it's connected to a terminal, it uses line buffering.  Otherwise, it uses default buffering
2010-10-24T15:56:09  <jklandis> But why does the problem only happen some of the time?
2010-10-24T15:56:51  <jklandis> Yep.
2010-10-24T15:57:03  <jklandis> If I concatenate all the maps together into one big map and send that
2010-10-24T15:57:12  <jklandis> it's so big SSH doesn't have the choice but to flush
2010-10-24T15:57:24  <jklandis> and it gets sent
2010-10-24T15:57:27  <jklandis> bingo
2010-10-24T15:57:55  <jklandis> I don't understand why this code ever works
2010-10-24T16:00:01  <jklandis> So... how can we force SSH into line-buffering mode?
2010-10-24T16:01:09  <a1k0n> jklandis: ssh -t?
2010-10-24T16:01:43  <a1k0n> you're running bots via ssh instead of running the tournament on the remote server?
2010-10-24T16:02:27  <jklandis> I'm not sure I understand your question
2010-10-24T16:02:44  <a1k0n> oh, er, nevermind
2010-10-24T16:02:44  <jklandis> On the tournament servers, each bot is run as a separate user
2010-10-24T16:02:49  <jklandis> via ssh
2010-10-24T16:02:52  <a1k0n> weird.
2010-10-24T16:02:58  <jklandis> as a form of sandboxing
2010-10-24T16:03:04  <a1k0n> why not... setuid adn chroot?
2010-10-24T16:03:09  <jklandis> I don't know why "su" isn't good enough
2010-10-24T16:03:17  <jklandis> maybe because of passwords
2010-10-24T16:03:29  <jklandis> SSH lets you use a key file
2010-10-24T16:03:42  <jklandis> I didn't design all this, I'm just trying to get it to wirk
2010-10-24T16:03:50  <a1k0n> su doesn't ask for a password if you run it as root
2010-10-24T16:03:58  <jklandis> but ssh -t looks promising
2010-10-24T16:05:06  <jklandis> Or maybe they could configure sudo

2010-10-24T19:12:05  <jklandis> If you aren't familiar with SVN, start with trunk, and look under planet_wars
2010-10-24T19:13:07  <jklandis> I believe PlayGame.jar is built from the sources under viz
2010-10-24T19:13:13  <FlagCapper> Thanks
2010-10-24T19:13:30  <FlagCapper> I think engine.py might also do
2010-10-24T19:13:55  <jklandis> Well engine.py runs on the server, and you will have trouble using it without a bunch of stuff set up
2010-10-24T19:14:29  <jklandis> But maybe you just want to see how it works.

2010-10-24T22:06:27  <jklandis> except that you only consider targets at distance 2
2010-10-24T22:06:35  <Mathnerd314> distance 1, actually
2010-10-24T22:07:04  <jklandis> fleets travel during the turn on which they are launched
2010-10-24T22:07:42  <Mathnerd314> yeah...
2010-10-24T22:09:02  <jklandis> I guess it doesn't matter what happens at the end of the last turn however
2010-10-24T22:09:12  <jklandis> you will have already earned your bonus ships
2010-10-24T22:09:21  <jklandis> the outcome can't affect the score
2010-10-24T22:09:37  <Mathnerd314> actually, it can: you can waste ships on a neutral
2010-10-24T22:11:10  <jklandis> I do not think the map generator allows planets at distance 1
2010-10-24T22:11:26  <jklandis> It would create strange sequencing problems in the game engine

2010-10-24T22:12:07  <jklandis> It would be possible to accidentally make an illegal move
2010-10-24T22:12:31  <jklandis> Depending on the order in which the moves get processed
2010-10-24T22:12:44  <Mathnerd314> no...

2010-10-24T22:13:37  <Mathnerd314> read engine.py
2010-10-24T22:15:49  <jklandis> I think you are right
2010-10-24T22:16:09  <jklandis> Still, I do not think planets at distance 1 are allowed
2010-10-24T22:16:25  <Mathnerd314> check the maps :p
2010-10-24T22:17:02  <Mathnerd314> or map_generator.py
2010-10-24T22:17:26  <jklandis> I see a check for dist <= 1 in too_close()
2010-10-24T22:18:34  <Mathnerd314> anyways, I don't care; it is an interesting problem
2010-10-24T22:21:36  <Mathnerd314> for example, if you have one planet connected to lots of neutrals, then it is the 0-1 knapsack problem

2010-10-24T22:27:34  <Mathnerd314> but enemies add a whole new dimension :D

2010-10-24T22:34:20  <jklandis> are you aware of any simple examples where there is no dominant strategy?
2010-10-24T22:34:27  <jklandis> say with 3 planets?

2010-10-24T22:47:59  <dmj111> i think mcleopold and jmcarthur have discussed various situations that they believe have no dominant strategy.  I did not follow it closely though.  Its been in the last week or two.
2010-10-24T22:50:31  <jmcarthur> dmj111: we always turn up short
2010-10-24T22:51:04  <jmcarthur> it was at least a couple weeks ago
2010-10-24T22:51:14  <jmcarthur> i'm not even really participating now. real life beat me down
2010-10-24T22:54:25  <dmj111> ahh.  sorry to hear that.  I keep trying to step away, but get deluded into thinking I have something else that will work.
2010-10-24T22:56:35  <jklandis> I keep wanting subgame analysis to work
2010-10-24T22:56:47  <jklandis> some maps have these tempting little clusters
2010-10-24T22:59:53  <Mathnerd314> too short-sighted. you're limited to 6-7 moves
2010-10-24T23:00:01  <dmj111> at one point, I tried treating groups of planets I owned that were all closer to each other than any enemy as a "super planet".  That way, I could attack/defend as one from them, kind of.
2010-10-24T23:00:36  <dmj111> most of my code assumes the worst from the enemy, and this clustering idea would help mitigate it, but not really enough.
2010-10-24T23:01:36  <Mathnerd314> if I can just get optimal strategy for the next-to-last move, and implement it, I feel as though my bot will win most games
2010-10-24T23:04:21  <jklandis> A lot of the time when playing the game manually I end up thinking "how many ships do I need to send to that region over there to tip the balance?"
2010-10-24T23:04:27  <amstan> how's everyone?
2010-10-24T23:04:45  <jklandis> I don't know how to make that question precise

2010-10-24T23:26:27  <antimatroid1> dmj111: when you assume the worst, how do you prevent it from doing nothing the second it gets behind :P
2010-10-24T23:26:46  <antimatroid1> i was trying to work out a way to do that, but then realised the enemy would ruin me first turn just by expanding more
