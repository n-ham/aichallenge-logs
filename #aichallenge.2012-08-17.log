2012-08-17T10:15:47  <antimatroid> mcstar: i can read these problems now :P
2012-08-17T10:15:51  <antimatroid> also no more bms ever :(
2012-08-17T10:24:29  <mcstar> antimatroid: bms?
2012-08-17T10:24:39  <antimatroid> blue mountain state
2012-08-17T10:24:43  <antimatroid> good show if you like that kind of thing
2012-08-17T10:24:57  <mcstar> i dont know what kind of show that is, so i cant say
2012-08-17T10:25:15  <antimatroid> basically a good version of original american pie
2012-08-17T10:25:23  <antimatroid> ie. college football team that parties a lot
2012-08-17T10:25:44  <mcstar> not my plate of pie
2012-08-17T10:26:22  <mcstar> ^^ more catchier than 'not my cup of tea' dont you think?
2012-08-17T10:26:49  <pairofdice> slice of pie?
2012-08-17T10:27:15  <mcstar> not bad, but i'd prefer p
2012-08-17T10:29:17  <mcstar> antimatroid: there are 3 new problems
2012-08-17T10:29:30  <mcstar> yesterday he had his last interview
2012-08-17T10:29:36  <mcstar> he got the contract
2012-08-17T10:29:43  <antimatroid> nice
2012-08-17T10:29:46  <mcstar> till the end of this year
2012-08-17T10:29:48  <antimatroid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gT6Urkyh4o i'm trying to learn this stuff
2012-08-17T10:29:54  <mcstar> after that they said they will see..
2012-08-17T10:30:01  <antimatroid> that's good
2012-08-17T10:31:01  <mcstar> im doing renormalization now
2012-08-17T10:31:17  <mcstar> i hope i cant mold my theory to get some answers...
2012-08-17T10:31:28  <mcstar> i cant deal with category theory right now, sorry
2012-08-17T10:31:42  <mcstar> cant -> can
2012-08-17T10:32:43  <mcstar> antimatroid: are you going to give haskell a try again? (seems like a logical next step)
2012-08-17T10:32:53  <antimatroid> not at the moment
2012-08-17T10:33:10  <antimatroid> too many other things with higher priority
2012-08-17T10:33:57  <thestinger> antimatroid >>= haskell
2012-08-17T10:34:06  <mcstar> i just read one or two articles on functional programming sometimes, as a recreation
2012-08-17T10:34:48  <mcstar> <interactive>:2:1: Not in scope: `antimatroid'
2012-08-17T10:34:50  <mcstar> <interactive>:2:17: Not in scope: `haskell'
2012-08-17T10:34:51  <antimatroid> things i want to know about: category theory, representation/character theory, (co)homology etc. and they're all very confusing to me
2012-08-17T10:35:25  <antimatroid> i need to know some representation/character theory before i can understand the point of all the diagram stuff i'm doing for the thesis
2012-08-17T10:35:26  <mcstar> classmate of mine was at home in cohomolgy
2012-08-17T10:36:06  <mcstar> he went to the usa studying string theory
2012-08-17T10:36:39  <antimatroid> oh and lie algebra/groups
2012-08-17T10:36:50  <mcstar> haha, the usual suspects
2012-08-17T10:36:56  <antimatroid> yep :P
2012-08-17T10:37:10  <antimatroid> it's ridiculous how deep the rabbit hole goes
2012-08-17T10:37:30  <mcstar> i prefer approaching math from a different angle
2012-08-17T10:37:35  <mcstar> from formal logic XD
2012-08-17T10:37:39  <pairofdice> They keep making the rabbit hole deeper
2012-08-17T10:37:43  <antimatroid> masochist over here
2012-08-17T10:38:11  <mcstar> but who feeds the rabbits?
2012-08-17T10:38:18  <antimatroid> government funding
2012-08-17T10:38:27  <antimatroid> and undergrads
2012-08-17T10:38:48  <mcstar> academia caused the financial recession, ive been telling this for decades...
2012-08-17T10:39:02  <antimatroid> lots of things caused the financial recession
2012-08-17T10:39:11  <antimatroid> i don't think academia was really one of them?
2012-08-17T10:39:15  * mcstar was joking as usual
2012-08-17T10:39:20  <antimatroid> i know, was just checking
2012-08-17T10:39:41  <antimatroid> the current trend in the us with education is a bit worrying
2012-08-17T10:39:51  * antimatroid is too lazy to hold shift down
2012-08-17T10:39:51  <mcstar> (but really, it is not always the best investment for a country to support basic research)
2012-08-17T10:40:36  <antimatroid> no, although pure maths is getting less funding as more people demand to know immediate applications of potential research projects
2012-08-17T10:40:39  <antimatroid> which is a little sad imo
2012-08-17T10:41:03  <mcstar> yeah, but understandable
2012-08-17T10:41:06  <mcstar> i think
2012-08-17T10:41:23  <antimatroid> dunno, it just makes a lot of research applications full of bullshit
2012-08-17T10:41:23  <mcstar> i mean there are lots of areas, that could have a bigger impact on our lives
2012-08-17T10:41:29  <mcstar> like bio and nanotech
2012-08-17T10:41:55  <antimatroid> sure, but without pure maths in times past we wouldn't have such research fields today
2012-08-17T10:42:12  <antimatroid> who's to say what will come from still funding the expansion of our mathematical knowledge?
2012-08-17T10:42:22  <mcstar> basic research will always be done, the less funding just results in the best minds doing that kind of research
2012-08-17T10:42:51  <antimatroid> i think research is one of those things which is socially optimal to be publicly funded
2012-08-17T10:42:56  <antimatroid> especially mathematics
2012-08-17T10:43:10  <antimatroid> it isn't usually useful enough fast enough for the mathematician to profit
2012-08-17T10:43:20  <antimatroid> nor are they legally allowed to patent etc. their work
2012-08-17T10:43:28  <mcstar> bottom line is, i hate barking dogs
2012-08-17T10:43:31  <antimatroid> i am of course heavily biased
2012-08-17T10:44:25  <mcstar> antimatroid: so you want to hear the problems?
2012-08-17T10:44:33  <antimatroid> shoot
2012-08-17T10:44:36  <mcstar> i dont have much time, but ill tel these
2012-08-17T10:44:48  <antimatroid> yeah give them to me and i'll have a play
2012-08-17T10:44:55  <antimatroid> it better not rain tomorrow
2012-08-17T10:44:57  <antimatroid> i want to go skating
2012-08-17T10:45:01  <antimatroid> well, today
2012-08-17T10:45:15  <mcstar> i hope i remember this one correctly
2012-08-17T10:45:20  <mcstar> i have it on ppaer somewhere
2012-08-17T10:45:28  <mcstar> but i cant find it in the heap i have beside my desk
2012-08-17T10:45:45  <mcstar> A<B real bumbers
2012-08-17T10:45:48  <mcstar> numbers*
2012-08-17T10:46:19  <mcstar> write max(A,min(x,B)) as a*min(x,b)+c*min(x,d)+e
2012-08-17T10:46:31  <mcstar> with a,b,c,d,e expressed via A,B
2012-08-17T10:48:15  <mcstar> (the guy said, this tripped up mathematicians....)
2012-08-17T10:48:30  <mcstar> he apparently had to explain this to them, which is weird
2012-08-17T10:50:32  <antimatroid> hehe, i'm not sure how to go about it right away :P
2012-08-17T10:51:16  <mcstar> with pen and paper
2012-08-17T10:51:48  <antimatroid> fair point
2012-08-17T10:52:00  <mcstar> incidentally, my friend made a mistake in telling me this
2012-08-17T10:52:00  <antimatroid> let me go get some
2012-08-17T10:52:04  <antimatroid> i've run out of lined paper
2012-08-17T10:52:14  <mcstar> ha said max(A,max(x,b))
2012-08-17T10:52:19  <mcstar> and i solved that at first
2012-08-17T10:52:26  <mcstar> (which needs a bit of trick to work)
2012-08-17T11:01:30  <antimatroid> hmmmm
2012-08-17T11:01:35  <antimatroid> well i know it equals the middle number
2012-08-17T11:01:48  <antimatroid> but still not seeing how to put it how they want
2012-08-17T11:01:52  <antimatroid> will continue playing though
2012-08-17T11:03:15  <mcstar> antimatroid: what do you mean?
2012-08-17T11:03:21  <mcstar> equals the middle number?
2012-08-17T11:03:48  <antimatroid> if A<x<B then max(A, min(x, B)) = max(A, x) = x
2012-08-17T11:03:49  <antimatroid> etc.

2012-08-17T11:04:02  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-17T11:04:30  <mcstar> the two formulas can give the exact same function of x if you choose a,b,c,d,e correctly
2012-08-17T11:04:46  <mcstar> and those parameters cant contain x, only A and B
2012-08-17T11:05:17  <antimatroid> yeah i think i might have it hang on

2012-08-17T11:06:29  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-17T11:06:52  <antimatroid> how long was he given?
2012-08-17T11:08:00  <mcstar> i think this was done over the phone
2012-08-17T11:08:06  <mcstar> and a second problem too
2012-08-17T11:08:10  <antimatroid> i think i failed aha
2012-08-17T11:08:20  <mcstar> and he had to do it in english
2012-08-17T11:08:30  <mcstar> i have to go outside but ill be back

2012-08-17T13:26:37  <mcstar> what?
2012-08-17T13:26:56  <mleise> I didn't know that "say hello to my little friend" was from a movie. i know it from the first hitman game
2012-08-17T13:27:20  <mcstar> i never said "say hello to my little friend"
2012-08-17T13:27:22  <mleise> mcstar: there is the bible verse from pulp fiction, the "dodge this" scene, and "you talkin to me"?
2012-08-17T13:27:41  <mcstar> i remembered those scenes
2012-08-17T13:27:50  <mleise> as well as "you've got to ask yourself a question. do i feel lucky?"
2012-08-17T13:27:50  <mcstar> not 'dodge this'
2012-08-17T13:27:59  <mcstar> well do you punk?
2012-08-17T13:28:07  <mleise> no... that's the copy
2012-08-17T13:28:14  <mleise> the original is clint eastwood

2012-08-17T13:30:40  <mcstar> haha
2012-08-17T13:30:48  <mcstar> last death, in departed
2012-08-17T13:30:50  <mcstar> that was nice
2012-08-17T13:31:22  <mleise> i haven't seen that I think
2012-08-17T13:31:27  <mcstar> very good movie
2012-08-17T13:31:44  <mcstar> i dont like dicaprio at all
2012-08-17T13:31:52  <mcstar> but he was good in that movie
2012-08-17T13:32:03  <mcstar> there are great performance in it
2012-08-17T13:32:07  <mcstar> ces*
2012-08-17T13:32:41  <mleise> well, he is a good actor. you can't say anything
2012-08-17T13:33:16  <mcstar> i can say that im not impressed
2012-08-17T13:33:23  <mcstar> but he was good in that movie
2012-08-17T13:33:36  <mcstar> mleise: im watching the collection
2012-08-17T13:33:39  <mleise> ok, which actor or actress does impress you?
2012-08-17T13:33:40  <mcstar> clint says it in it
2012-08-17T13:33:46  <mcstar> what was the problem before?
2012-08-17T13:34:01  <mleise> yeah i figgured that out. i misunderstood him
2012-08-17T13:34:17  <mleise> i thought for the mask they changed the line
2012-08-17T13:34:20  <mcstar> cause there are 2 scenes in that movie when he says this line
2012-08-17T13:34:30  <mcstar> in the beginning to the nigger
2012-08-17T13:34:35  <mcstar> thats irrelevant to the story
2012-08-17T13:34:48  <mcstar> and in the end, when he kills the serial killer
2012-08-17T13:34:58  <mcstar> by the lake
2012-08-17T13:35:42  <mleise> you said nigger
2012-08-17T13:35:48  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-17T13:36:14  <mleise> i begin to remember the movie now
2012-08-17T13:36:30  <mcstar> haha fuck, 'dodge this' is from the matrix
2012-08-17T13:36:43  <mcstar> i didnt recall it when you quoted that
2012-08-17T13:36:55  <mleise> that's why I said that you got your clips from this compilation, you showed the the matrix one once
2012-08-17T13:37:37  <mcstar> ah, long time ago
2012-08-17T13:37:44  <mcstar> i dont remember this compilation though
2012-08-17T13:37:47  <mleise> although the most badass thing about the matrix is slowmotion with deep bass sounds
2012-08-17T13:38:13  <mcstar> i think the philosophical questions are the most badass things about the matrix
2012-08-17T13:38:21  <mleise> not this compilation necessarily, but it matches your taste in movies ^^
2012-08-17T13:38:34  <mcstar> i havent watched the shining to the end
2012-08-17T13:38:38  <mcstar> once i started...
2012-08-17T13:39:03  <mleise> i watched it long time ago and didn't fall asleep
2012-08-17T13:39:26  <mcstar> ah, scarface, say hi to my litle friend
2012-08-17T13:40:22  <mcstar> nice ending with yipikayay

2012-08-17T14:58:41  <mcstar> i put it on top of an instant cappucino
2012-08-17T14:59:07  <mcstar> what a complete jerk-off would voluntarily swallow that quantity of cinnamon
2012-08-17T14:59:35  <mcstar> do they trick them into doing this?
2012-08-17T14:59:49  <pairofdice> It's called the cinnamon challenge
2012-08-17T15:00:04  <pairofdice> The guy in mythbusters managed to do it

2012-08-17T15:05:25  <mcstar> eheh
2012-08-17T15:06:27  <mcstar> i would never try this cinnamon challenge, i would worry that wold go into my airways

2012-08-17T15:08:24  <pairofdice> Naaaah
2012-08-17T15:08:48  <mcstar> yes
2012-08-17T15:09:06  <pairofdice> How so? What are the rules?
2012-08-17T15:09:07  <mcstar> he keeps it in his mouth and mixes it with this saliva
2012-08-17T15:09:41  <mcstar> he would have had the same reaction as the others if he didnt try to mix it in his whole mouth
2012-08-17T15:09:53  <mcstar> anyway, quite a stupid 'myth'
2012-08-17T15:10:04  <pairofdice> Yes, and doing something that doesn't work is stupid :)
2012-08-17T15:10:20  <mcstar> consider this:
2012-08-17T15:10:27  <mcstar> there are people who can swallow fire
2012-08-17T15:10:33  <mcstar> and most of us cant
2012-08-17T15:10:49  <mcstar> if you would pick some random assholes to try to do it they would fail
2012-08-17T15:10:54  <mcstar> and get into the hospital
2012-08-17T15:11:00  <pairofdice> Doesn't seem like a worthwhile skill to pursue to me
2012-08-17T15:11:04  <mcstar> now, would you say it is impossible to swallow fire?
2012-08-17T15:11:32  <pairofdice> No. And they have had several such myths that depend heavily on operator skill

2012-08-17T16:10:16  <thestinger> I wouldn't really say "know"
2012-08-17T16:10:32  <mcstar> thestinger: python falls into the category i started with
2012-08-17T16:10:39  <thestinger> mcstar: how so?
2012-08-17T16:10:41  <mcstar> so does c and the rest
2012-08-17T16:10:59  <mcstar> there is no let
2012-08-17T16:11:10  <thestinger> mcstar: C has block-scoping
2012-08-17T16:11:13  <thestinger> same thing
2012-08-17T16:11:27  <thestinger> python doesn't
2012-08-17T16:11:29  <mcstar> what about in the scope?
2012-08-17T16:11:32  <mcstar> so..
2012-08-17T16:11:47  <mcstar> anyway, this is more of a concept of non-compiled languages
2012-08-17T16:11:51  <mcstar> concern*
2012-08-17T16:12:34  <mcstar> languages which support interactive evaluation should have a construct to introduce local variables
2012-08-17T16:13:55  <thestinger> python just does the javascript thing
2012-08-17T16:14:12  <thestinger> any variables you use get declared as locals for you
2012-08-17T16:14:18  <thestinger> so no block scope
2012-08-17T16:14:49  <pairofdice> Errr
2012-08-17T16:15:49  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/CJdj like that
2012-08-17T16:16:06  <thestinger> js has the same stupidity
2012-08-17T16:17:52  <mcstar> http://i.imgur.com/9qpPk.png
2012-08-17T16:18:01  <mcstar> look at that mess, mathematica's local bindings
2012-08-17T16:18:19  <thestinger> ..
2012-08-17T16:19:35  <mcstar> thestinger: what was supposed your snippet demonstrate?
2012-08-17T16:20:07  <thestinger> mcstar: that there is only function scope
2012-08-17T16:20:14  <thestinger> any variable used in a function exists in the whole function
2012-08-17T16:20:22  <thestinger> there are no block scopes and it doesn't matter when you first declare it
2012-08-17T16:20:27  <thestinger> js works exactly the same way
2012-08-17T16:21:05  <thestinger> but in python you get an exception for using a defined but unassigned variable
2012-08-17T16:21:16  <thestinger> js stays silent (undefined is a valid value)
2012-08-17T16:21:37  <mcstar> i dont get this
2012-08-17T16:21:42  <mcstar> what is surprising there?
2012-08-17T16:21:47  <mcstar> there is an 'x'
2012-08-17T16:22:01  <mcstar> if there was a global one, print would have picked that up
2012-08-17T16:22:01  <pairofdice> And it's defined after you use it
2012-08-17T16:22:12  <mcstar> no
2012-08-17T16:22:16  <thestinger> pairofdice: it's defined in the whole function
2012-08-17T16:22:18  <mcstar> it is defined in the function
2012-08-17T16:22:22  <thestinger> it's just not assigned yet
2012-08-17T16:22:26  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-17T16:22:29  <mcstar> but whats the problem?
2012-08-17T16:22:39  <mcstar> python's evaluation model is weird anyway
2012-08-17T16:22:58  <pairofdice> no...
2012-08-17T16:23:05  <thestinger> pairofdice: yes, look at my paste
2012-08-17T16:23:23  <thestinger> it would say NameError: name 'x' is not defined
2012-08-17T16:23:30  <thestinger> if I hadn't done x = 5 anywhere in the function
2012-08-17T16:23:34  <pairofdice> I wasn't saying that
2012-08-17T16:24:10  <mcstar> "And it's defined after you use it"
2012-08-17T16:24:15  <mcstar> thats what you said
2012-08-17T16:24:26  <pairofdice> Yeah.
2012-08-17T16:24:39  <mcstar> it sis defined, when python's evaluator evaluated the function body
2012-08-17T16:24:44  <mcstar> in some way
2012-08-17T16:24:51  <thestinger> yeah, compiles to bytecode
2012-08-17T16:24:58  <mcstar> but not when executed it
2012-08-17T16:25:07  <thestinger> the bytecode puts the definition at the top
2012-08-17T16:25:14  <thestinger> so it happens before the interpreter sees it
2012-08-17T16:25:35  <mcstar> i want lisp's 'let' and 'let*' in every language
2012-08-17T16:26:02  <mcstar> haskell's let is nice too ofc, but it is always recursive
2012-08-17T16:26:09  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/IhBF it's just weird
2012-08-17T16:26:24  <mcstar> ocaml has 'let' 'let rec' and 'let _ and _'
2012-08-17T16:26:52  <mcstar> so in mathematica i cant bind things succesively
2012-08-17T16:27:19  <mcstar> i cant use a prevously bound name in a later biding in the same With/Block/Module
2012-08-17T16:27:29  <mcstar> i would have to NEST these
2012-08-17T16:27:43  <mcstar> go wolfram and … yourself
2012-08-17T16:27:56  <mcstar> genious my ass
2012-08-17T16:28:06  <mcstar> not a bigger genious than jobs
2012-08-17T16:28:26  <thestinger> heh
2012-08-17T16:32:06  <mcstar> i wish some symbolic/numerical environment had a notebook interface as good as mathematica's and would have the same quality plotting
2012-08-17T16:32:54  <thestinger> R?
2012-08-17T16:33:05  <mcstar> R is weird
2012-08-17T16:33:13  <mcstar> and it doesnt really fit
2012-08-17T16:33:20  <mcstar> and quite slow
2012-08-17T16:33:29  <mcstar> it doesnt have a notebook
2012-08-17T16:33:44  <mcstar> but the graphics are probably ok, at least the 2d ones
2012-08-17T16:34:06  <mcstar> sage has a web notebook
2012-08-17T16:34:28  <mcstar> it has some nice features, but overall, mathematica's is better
2012-08-17T16:34:30  <thestinger> mcstar: and there's that new language
2012-08-17T16:34:34  <thestinger> but ofc it's new
2012-08-17T16:34:39  <mcstar> what?
2012-08-17T16:34:39  <thestinger> so it won't have good libs yet :P
2012-08-17T16:34:42  <thestinger> mcstar: http://julialang.org/
2012-08-17T16:34:47  <mcstar> i know julia
2012-08-17T16:34:52  <mcstar> been writing some things in it
2012-08-17T16:35:07  <mcstar> its web interface is just a repl that can inline pictures
2012-08-17T16:35:16  <mcstar> way less sophisticated than sage's
2012-08-17T16:35:22  <mcstar> but the language is very nice
2012-08-17T16:35:48  <mcstar> supports macros for example, you can access easily the AST
2012-08-17T16:36:00  <mcstar> jit makes it fast even without type annotations
2012-08-17T16:36:23  <mcstar> allocation saturated programs or gc heavy ones dont perform too well for now
2012-08-17T16:36:39  <mcstar> the type system is quite good
2012-08-17T16:36:53  * thestinger really likes rust
2012-08-17T16:37:03  <mcstar> you can have abstract type hierarchies and union types
2012-08-17T16:37:16  <mcstar> but the thing loads pretty slowly
2012-08-17T16:37:33  <mcstar> it does the llvm compilation of the whole core language every time you start it
2012-08-17T16:37:38  <thestinger> heh
2012-08-17T16:37:43  <mcstar> so you cant just fire this up for scripts
2012-08-17T16:37:50  <mcstar> but they will improve on this
2012-08-17T16:38:03  <mcstar> really, it is just too young for everything to be smooth
2012-08-17T16:38:08  <thestinger> rust is actually pretty neat, it's a mix of haskell and c++
2012-08-17T16:38:55  <mcstar> Type inferenceyes, only local variables
2012-08-17T16:38:59  <mcstar> :(
2012-08-17T16:39:11  <thestinger> mcstar: it still has generic functions with inference
2012-08-17T16:39:21  <thestinger> parametric polymorphism I should say
2012-08-17T16:39:22  <mcstar> Generic typesyes, only simple, non-turing-complete substitution
2012-08-17T16:39:29  <thestinger> mcstar: as in, like haskell
2012-08-17T16:39:32  <thestinger> not like C++
2012-08-17T16:39:45  <mcstar> haskell has a lot of extensions to simple parametric polimorphism
2012-08-17T16:39:51  <mcstar> first of all, it has typeclasses
2012-08-17T16:40:03  <mcstar> ocaml at least has functors
2012-08-17T16:40:25  <mcstar> haskell can handle higher kinded types, and functional dependencies with typeclasses even
2012-08-17T16:41:17  <thestinger> mcstar: http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#traits
2012-08-17T16:41:23  <thestinger> http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#basic-datatypes
2012-08-17T16:41:37  <thestinger> ofc it doesn't cover all the things that ghc extensions do
2012-08-17T16:41:46  <mcstar> the next language that im going to familiarize myself with, is X-10
2012-08-17T16:42:39  <mcstar> thestinger: rust might be good, but there are already great alternatives
2012-08-17T16:42:54  <thestinger> mcstar: rust aims to be an alternative to C++ though
2012-08-17T16:43:06  <thestinger> (i.e. not mandating GC or adding any overhead over idiomatic C++)
2012-08-17T16:43:13  <mcstar> but i can use haskell/ocaml/f# already as an alternative
2012-08-17T16:43:41  <mcstar> some people just cant live without curly braces
2012-08-17T16:43:50  <thestinger> they might change the syntax
2012-08-17T16:44:02  <thestinger> the author has say he will, and he changes it every month :P
2012-08-17T16:44:04  <thestinger> said*
2012-08-17T16:44:09  <mcstar> D is already better than c++, at least mleise would say that
2012-08-17T16:46:11  <thestinger> I don't think D has lightweight threads
2012-08-17T16:46:49  <thestinger> and it basically mandates GC for the nice features
2012-08-17T16:46:54  <thestinger> it *is* a better language than C++
2012-08-17T16:47:20  <thestinger> but the implementation isn't great
2012-08-17T16:47:37  <mcstar> i sort of decided what i want to do
2012-08-17T16:47:51  <mcstar> use c++ as less as i can
2012-08-17T16:47:57  <thestinger> sounds good
2012-08-17T16:48:06  <mcstar> grok better haskell/ocaml/f#
2012-08-17T16:48:21  <mcstar> leave the lisps such as common lisp and clojure alone
2012-08-17T16:48:35  <thestinger> why? speed?
2012-08-17T16:48:41  <mcstar> and for highperformance and scientific number crunching learn x-10

2012-08-17T17:17:17  <mcstar> it has 2 nice colors
2012-08-17T17:17:20  <thestinger> yes, that's simple
2012-08-17T17:17:31  <mcstar> actually, 3 colors
2012-08-17T17:17:36  <mcstar> i dont think zsh can handle that
2012-08-17T17:17:43  <thestinger> sure it can

2012-08-17T17:17:50  <mcstar> im trying to joke here

2012-08-17T17:21:07  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-17T17:21:16  <mcstar> i was trying to load up a matrix from file with numpy
2012-08-17T17:21:29  <thestinger> you have to use os.path.expanduser

2012-08-17T17:23:12  <mcstar> hm, i think i always used relative and absolute paths before, but never with ~
2012-08-17T17:24:04  <thestinger> also sys.path[0] is your friend for relative ones (the dir the script is in)

2012-08-17T18:45:47  <mcstar> python trouble
2012-08-17T18:46:03  <mcstar> imagine i have 2 numpy.ndarrays
2012-08-17T18:46:17  <mcstar> i can apply some numeric function to the one, and not the other
2012-08-17T18:46:21  <mcstar> like exp, or sin
2012-08-17T18:46:32  <mcstar> AttributeError: exp
2012-08-17T18:47:13  <mcstar> what does this attribute error mean usually?
2012-08-17T18:47:56  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-17T18:48:00  <mcstar> i might have a clue
2012-08-17T18:49:23  <mcstar> array(…, dtype=object)
2012-08-17T18:49:45  <mcstar> why on earth would the type of the elements of the array be object
2012-08-17T18:50:00  <mcstar> because sage-numpy interaction sucks
2012-08-17T18:50:09  <mcstar> in sage 5.1 or something
2012-08-17T18:50:59  <mcstar> <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
2012-08-17T18:51:08  <mcstar> instead of float
2012-08-17T18:51:30  <mcstar> nice, ive been looking at this for 5 minutes
2012-08-17T18:52:05  <mcstar> and thestinger just doesnt care, he is right
2012-08-17T18:52:41  <thestinger> mcstar: it's object because it has arbitrary python object's in it
2012-08-17T18:52:43  <thestinger> objects*
2012-08-17T18:52:54  <mcstar> i know what object means
2012-08-17T18:53:05  <mcstar> but that doesnt explain why it is object and not float
2012-08-17T18:53:18  <mcstar> the problem is that sage's integers are classes
2012-08-17T18:54:21  <mcstar> and numpy.linspace can actually use them
2012-08-17T18:54:30  <thestinger> AttributeError would mean that something did foo.exp
2012-08-17T18:54:33  <mcstar> but it wont give back an array floats
2012-08-17T18:54:35  <thestinger> and it had no exp attribute
2012-08-17T18:54:47  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-17T18:56:01  <mcstar> sage's integers => sage's numbers
2012-08-17T18:56:30  <mcstar> i hate this, getting sidetracked all the time
2012-08-17T18:56:43  <mcstar> one time i will get really angry about these kinds of thinds
