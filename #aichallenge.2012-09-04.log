2012-09-04T04:20:32  <mcstar> antimatroidl: hey
2012-09-04T04:20:41  <antimatroidl> hello
2012-09-04T04:20:51  <mcstar> you were gone yesterday
2012-09-04T04:21:00  <mcstar> i mean, when i finished the stuff
2012-09-04T04:21:05  <mcstar> i think it is working
2012-09-04T04:21:52  <mcstar> antimatroidl: can you give me some complicated diagrams to multiply?
2012-09-04T04:22:02  <antimatroidl> brb phone
2012-09-04T04:27:52  <antimatroidl> mcstar: are you wanting to confirm if it's right?
2012-09-04T04:28:02  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-04T04:28:05  <antimatroidl> count the number of unique diagrams you can generate from the generators
2012-09-04T04:28:18  <antimatroidl> do you want to know the algorithm for that?
2012-09-04T04:28:33  <mcstar> i think it is going to be too much
2012-09-04T04:28:43  <mcstar> i just want to check if it is probably correct
2012-09-04T04:29:01  <mcstar> i dont want to spend much more time on it :)
2012-09-04T04:29:20  <mcstar> antimatroidl: how complicated is to generate the generators?
2012-09-04T04:29:27  <antimatroidl> easy
2012-09-04T04:29:51  <mcstar> tell me
2012-09-04T04:30:43  <mcstar> antimatroidl: even if it is wrong, it is quite shorter than the c++
2012-09-04T04:30:50  <mcstar> and fixable
2012-09-04T04:30:56  <mcstar> (if it wrong)
2012-09-04T04:31:03  <antimatroidl> http://sketchia.com/draw.html#r4LOUzf
2012-09-04T04:31:10  <antimatroidl> i know how to make mine better now
2012-09-04T04:31:23  <antimatroidl> do those fat lines make sense for the generators?
2012-09-04T04:31:38  <antimatroidl> you have straight lines except two "triapses" above and below each other
2012-09-04T04:31:47  <antimatroidl> for n points along the top you have n-3 generators
2012-09-04T04:32:24  <antimatroidl> then to get the dictionary, add the generators as words, and add all new words to a queue, then right multiply each word on the queue by each of the generators and check whether it's a new diagram
2012-09-04T04:32:30  <antimatroidl> if it's new then add it as a new word
2012-09-04T04:33:41  <mcstar> antimatroidl: ok, so generators of length n only differ in the position the triapse appears?
2012-09-04T04:35:15  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-04T04:35:27  <antimatroidl> "of length n" is not terminology i would use though
2012-09-04T04:35:33  <mcstar> why?
2012-09-04T04:35:41  <antimatroidl> i call the semigroup generated by the n-3 generators F_n
2012-09-04T04:35:50  <mcstar> you cant take the product of diagrams of different lenghts
2012-09-04T04:35:54  <antimatroidl> so they're the generators of F_n
2012-09-04T04:35:58  <antimatroidl> i kno whtat
2012-09-04T04:36:04  <mcstar> anyway, ill stick to thta
2012-09-04T04:36:08  <mcstar> you will understand
2012-09-04T04:36:12  <antimatroidl> but i wouldn't say the generators have length n
2012-09-04T04:36:19  <mcstar> no problem
2012-09-04T04:36:22  <antimatroidl> say they're generators of F_n :)
2012-09-04T04:36:27  <mcstar> of length n
2012-09-04T04:36:50  <antimatroidl> my friend and i worked out the structure of the lattice of ideals on F_5 today
2012-09-04T04:37:08  <antimatroidl> we ended up with something being the third row of "pascals pyramid" if you will
2012-09-04T04:37:19  <antimatroidl> for F_4 it's the second row of pascal's triangle
2012-09-04T04:37:24  <antimatroidl> i am hoping that generalises
2012-09-04T04:37:35  <mcstar> antimatroidl: ok, so if  you index the generators in their natural order(position of the triapse) you only take the product of n,m, m<n
2012-09-04T04:37:37  <mcstar> right?
2012-09-04T04:37:54  <antimatroidl> what?
2012-09-04T04:38:03  <antimatroidl> i call generators a, b, …, n-2
2012-09-04T04:38:10  <antimatroidl> you can do any product of them
2012-09-04T04:38:16  <antimatroidl> finite anyway
2012-09-04T04:38:35  <antimatroidl> infinite doesn't really matter, it'd have to be a countable product and wouldn't generate anything new
2012-09-04T04:38:42  <mcstar> a x n-2 will be almost the same as n-2 x a
2012-09-04T04:38:52  <antimatroidl> it will be the same
2012-09-04T04:38:58  <mcstar> thats why im asking
2012-09-04T04:39:00  <antimatroidl> well, unless n is small enough
2012-09-04T04:39:11  <mcstar> why take those products?
2012-09-04T04:39:19  <antimatroidl> that will be a relation for the presentation
2012-09-04T04:39:24  <mcstar> if you only take nxm m<n you leave them out
2012-09-04T04:39:39  <antimatroidl> nah, but for it to be a semigroup you need to have a binary operation on F_n
2012-09-04T04:39:49  <antimatroidl> you don't want to take out stuff like that
2012-09-04T04:40:00  <antimatroidl> the relations on the generators for the presentation will note that
2012-09-04T04:40:07  <mcstar> ok, so i have to take the product of 2 full vectors of generators
2012-09-04T04:40:23  <antimatroidl> no
2012-09-04T04:40:27  <mcstar> (just imagine they form an outer product)
2012-09-04T04:40:37  <antimatroidl> http://pastebin.com/icv9JsEM
2012-09-04T04:40:37  <mcstar> then what?
2012-09-04T04:40:41  <antimatroidl> that's my dictionary algorithm
2012-09-04T04:40:50  <mcstar> it is incredible how you dont ever understand what im sayikng
2012-09-04T04:41:34  <antimatroidl> http://pastebin.com/AqYVF6zD
2012-09-04T04:41:42  <antimatroidl> that's my dictionary for F_5
2012-09-04T04:42:06  <antimatroidl> those are all products i did while generating the dictionary, words on the same line are the same diagram
2012-09-04T04:42:56  <antimatroidl> does that make sense?
2012-09-04T04:43:56  <mcstar> i dont know how do you turn a diagram into a strign
2012-09-04T04:44:07  <antimatroidl> i do that when i'm making the dictionary
2012-09-04T04:44:22  <antimatroidl> i note which diagram i am right multipling with and whack that on the end of the string

2012-09-04T04:44:49  <antimatroidl> so i have a queue of pair<Diagram, string> if you will
2012-09-04T04:45:03  <antimatroidl> where string is the first word i found for that diagram
2012-09-04T04:45:17  <mcstar> ok i see
2012-09-04T04:45:20  <mcstar> but why?
2012-09-04T04:45:33  <mcstar> why do you need to turn a diagram into a string?
2012-09-04T04:45:58  <antimatroidl> a number of reasons
2012-09-04T04:45:58  <mcstar> is it only because you need to add it into a map?
2012-09-04T04:46:01  <antimatroidl> some examples….
2012-09-04T04:46:16  <antimatroidl> lets me know the decomposition of each diagram into generators
2012-09-04T04:46:18  <mcstar> ill just use structural identity
2012-09-04T04:46:42  <antimatroidl> some of the equivalent forms are not obvious, so i need to work out the relations on generators which cause that (i may even be able to pluck the relations out using these files)
2012-09-04T04:46:52  <mcstar> antimatroidl: but first, really give me 2 diagrams to multiply
2012-09-04T04:47:01  <mcstar> 2, which are complicated enough
2012-09-04T04:47:30  <mcstar> draw them, or give them in some textual representation
2012-09-04T04:52:48  <antimatroidl> mcstar: http://sketchia.com/draw.html#r4LOUzf
2012-09-04T04:53:16  <mcstar> ok, ill try
2012-09-04T04:53:56  <mcstar> antimatroidl: dont write down the product yet!
2012-09-04T04:54:38  <antimatroidl> well it shouldn't matter?
2012-09-04T04:54:45  <antimatroidl> you're algorithm is already written
2012-09-04T04:54:50  <antimatroidl> sorry anyway :P
2012-09-04T04:54:52  <mcstar> you will accuse me of cheating...
2012-09-04T04:54:56  <mcstar> XD
2012-09-04T04:55:36  <antimatroidl> haha nah
2012-09-04T05:00:20  <mcstar> antimatroidl: yeah, got it
2012-09-04T05:00:25  <mcstar> let me show it
2012-09-04T05:01:38  <mcstar> antimatroidl: http://i.imgur.com/qdqVx.png
2012-09-04T05:02:52  <mcstar> antimatroidl: im a bit reluctant to show you the code, it is ugly
2012-09-04T05:03:08  <antimatroidl> mcstar: mine was horrendous, it could not be worse
2012-09-04T05:03:15  <mcstar> the show function is bigger than the logic
2012-09-04T05:03:20  <mcstar> in fact the logic is on 3 lines

2012-09-04T05:03:38  <antimatroidl> i like your output
2012-09-04T05:03:45  <mcstar> lines 36-38
2012-09-04T05:04:33  <antimatroidl> what about them?
2012-09-04T05:04:36  <antimatroidl> i don't understand haskeel
2012-09-04T05:05:23  <mcstar> thats where the product happens
2012-09-04T05:05:39  <antimatroidl> what are you doing to get the product? intuitively?
2012-09-04T05:05:51  <mcstar> the other stuff in 'product' is just to convert the nice representation into something the algorithm works better
2012-09-04T05:05:58  <mcstar> the other big chunk is the show funciton

2012-09-04T05:06:34  <mcstar> well, im representing the diagram as a list of connected set
2012-09-04T05:06:41  <mcstar> no sorry
2012-09-04T05:06:46  <mcstar> list of disconnected sets
2012-09-04T05:07:00  <antimatroidl> what's a disconnected set?
2012-09-04T05:07:07  <antimatroidl> oh disjoint
2012-09-04T05:07:09  <antimatroidl> yep
2012-09-04T05:07:11  <mcstar> they have empty intersection
2012-09-04T05:07:20  <mcstar> yes, disjoint
2012-09-04T05:07:25  <mcstar> but we are talking about graphs
2012-09-04T05:07:27  <antimatroidl> yeah they partition the nodes
2012-09-04T05:07:33  <antimatroidl> they are sets
2012-09-04T05:07:40  <antimatroidl> they are disjoint sets :P i am a mathematician :P
2012-09-04T05:07:45  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-04T05:07:54  <antimatroidl> it's fine, i was just confused :P
2012-09-04T05:07:56  <mcstar> disconnected graphs and disjoint sets
2012-09-04T05:08:00  <mcstar> but you can follow
2012-09-04T05:08:20  <antimatroidl> i tried that but didn't find the product very easy to do
2012-09-04T05:08:47  <mcstar> so, before doing the product, i change the lower level of the first input into a 'middle' kind, and change the upper level of the second input too
2012-09-04T05:09:01  <mcstar> so now, these sets wont be mutually disjoint
2012-09-04T05:09:23  <mcstar> now what i do, is just sort of iteratively union up the sets that have any intersection
2012-09-04T05:09:26  <mcstar> with each other
2012-09-04T05:09:30  <antimatroidl> yep
2012-09-04T05:09:34  <mcstar> after that, i simply remove the middle kind
2012-09-04T05:09:35  <antimatroidl> that's what i was originally going to try
2012-09-04T05:09:44  <mcstar> well, it is there..
2012-09-04T05:09:46  <antimatroidl> i imagine that's faster than what i currently do
2012-09-04T05:09:49  <mcstar> and was quite easy
2012-09-04T05:09:56  <antimatroidl> i might try doing it again later
2012-09-04T05:10:18  <antimatroidl> i have like 10+ different things to play with these things now
2012-09-04T05:10:22  <mcstar> honestly, i did this to try to convince you that haskell might have something it can offer
2012-09-04T05:10:27  <antimatroidl> which is a good thing thesis progression wise
2012-09-04T05:10:32  <antimatroidl> hehe :P
2012-09-04T05:10:42  <antimatroidl> that syntax looks awful to me
2012-09-04T05:11:07  <mcstar> i caould say the same thing about c++
2012-09-04T05:11:15  <antimatroidl> i will eventually try and learn haskell again
2012-09-04T05:11:16  <mcstar> still, thats not a reason to not use it
2012-09-04T05:11:18  <antimatroidl> but not atm
2012-09-04T05:11:21  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-04T05:11:44  <antimatroidl> i want to get on top of hte phd stuff in the first year and then finish off that game theory paper
2012-09-04T05:11:52  <antimatroidl> then i can start worrying about other stuff
2012-09-04T05:11:55  <mcstar> my code except the logic part could relly be cleaned up, but that would take time
2012-09-04T05:12:03  <antimatroidl> over the summer when i don't have tutes to take i'll have more time too
2012-09-04T05:12:18  <antimatroidl> yeah, why clean if it works is my motto atm
2012-09-04T05:12:22  <mcstar> summer is over, what are you talking about?
2012-09-04T05:12:28  <antimatroidl> spring just started
2012-09-04T05:12:38  <antimatroidl> wore shorts the last two days
2012-09-04T05:13:53  <mcstar> antimatroidl: how do you print a diagram now?
2012-09-04T05:14:12  <mcstar> i remember you overloaded << for the diagram, right?
2012-09-04T05:14:26  <antimatroidl> yeah
2012-09-04T05:14:41  <mcstar> how?
2012-09-04T05:14:42  <antimatroidl> i made redundant structs just so i could output them with <<
2012-09-04T05:14:54  <antimatroidl> std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &os, const Dictionary &dictionary)
2012-09-04T05:14:59  <mcstar> no that
2012-09-04T05:15:01  <mcstar> com eon
2012-09-04T05:15:04  <antimatroidl> what?
2012-09-04T05:15:12  <antimatroidl> oh sorry aha
2012-09-04T05:15:14  <mcstar> whats the representation
2012-09-04T05:15:26  <antimatroidl> just as the disjoint sets
2012-09-04T05:15:29  <antimatroidl> ie. your list
2012-09-04T05:15:53  <antimatroidl> i will be changing to what you have
2012-09-04T05:16:04  <mcstar> ah, ok, just a linear representaion
2012-09-04T05:16:38  <mcstar> haskell gives you that by saying 'deriving Show'
2012-09-04T05:16:45  <antimatroidl> my friend likes sprunge btw
2012-09-04T05:17:00  <antimatroidl> i am often in a zombie state when talking to you

2012-09-04T05:30:38  <antimatroidl> mcstar: what have you completed academia wise?
2012-09-04T05:45:17  <aerique> I really could have done with a nice AI challenge this year.
2012-09-04T05:45:35  <antimatroidl> aerique: ants was this year!
2012-09-04T05:47:40  <aerique> antimatroidl: if you're splitting hairs: yes :-)  unfortunately i couldn't compete in it
2012-09-04T05:48:12  <antimatroidl> i have no time for a contest at the moment
2012-09-04T05:48:18  <antimatroidl> but would like another one next year
2012-09-04T05:48:26  <pairofdice> .... it wasn't
2012-09-04T05:48:44  <antimatroidl> shit, i'm retarded :P
2012-09-04T05:48:46  <aerique> perhaps beginning of next year would be a nice target
2012-09-04T05:48:53  <antimatroidl> pairofdice: you're right
2012-09-04T05:49:00  <antimatroidl> there is no current plans
2012-09-04T05:49:05  <antimatroidl> i don't think anybody has time
2012-09-04T05:49:29  <antimatroidl> i hate the phrase "i don't think" yet i can't break saying it
2012-09-04T05:49:52  <aerique> i think someone had made some progress with asteroids
2012-09-04T05:50:00  <antimatroidl> smley
2012-09-04T05:50:03  <aerique> yeah
2012-09-04T05:50:16  <antimatroidl> we need to do organisational stuff first though
2012-09-04T05:50:25  <antimatroidl> last i heard jeff was moving to google and wanted to get involved again
2012-09-04T05:50:35  <antimatroidl> but i don't think the getting involved again ever happened
2012-09-04T05:50:36  <aerique> that's good to hear
2012-09-04T05:50:40  <antimatroidl> unsurprisingly
2012-09-04T05:50:44  <aerique> it wasn't clear to me what the holdup was
2012-09-04T05:51:27  <aerique> the contest seemed to be doing more or less fine without all the official stuff
2012-09-04T05:51:34  <aerique> (except money for the servers ;-) )
2012-09-04T05:51:48  <antimatroidl> only because janzert held everything together
2012-09-04T05:51:57  <aerique> but i could poney up 100 euros and I assume others can as well
2012-09-04T05:52:05  <antimatroidl> there's the organisational issue
2012-09-04T05:52:11  <antimatroidl> we can't take donations until that is sorted
2012-09-04T05:52:14  <aerique> right and before that McLeopold
2012-09-04T05:52:27  <antimatroidl> no, janzert was holding the fort up long before McLeopold
2012-09-04T05:52:38  <aerique> okey, didn't know that
2012-09-04T05:52:40  <antimatroidl> McLeopold was also vital for ants, janzert was vital for planet wars too
2012-09-04T05:53:28  <aerique> alright, that clears some things up. thanks
2012-09-04T05:53:36  <Areks> people, can anyone say how to debug bot on java? I tried many variants. (
2012-09-04T05:53:55  <aerique> Areks: been too long for me, sorry
2012-09-04T05:54:16  <antimatroidl> i haven't touched ai code since last year and java in years sorry
2012-09-04T05:54:36  <aerique> I like this challenge best compared to many others that have propped up since one is not tied to a specific language.
2012-09-04T05:54:47  <antimatroidl> yeah i haven't been able to get into any other contests
2012-09-04T05:54:51  <antimatroidl> whereas these are awesome
2012-09-04T05:55:02  <antimatroidl> i am a big fan of the simple io format
2012-09-04T05:55:07  <aerique> same here
2012-09-04T05:55:08  <antimatroidl> something i fought hard to keep with ants
2012-09-04T05:55:41  <antimatroidl> more experienced programmers prefer some kind of standised format i forget what it's called
2012-09-04T05:55:47  <antimatroidl> standardised*
2012-09-04T05:56:07  <antimatroidl> but i like something that's easy to read without using extra packages
2012-09-04T05:56:08  <aerique> hmm, we standardize on the io specs for every challenge, no?
2012-09-04T05:56:24  <antimatroidl> nah something which is used across languages quite often
2012-09-04T05:56:29  <antimatroidl> errr, i wish i could remember the name
2012-09-04T05:56:32  <aerique> right, xml or json
2012-09-04T05:56:35  <antimatroidl> json that's it
2012-09-04T05:56:40  <antimatroidl> i don't want that personally
2012-09-04T05:56:40  <aerique> the current format is fine
2012-09-04T05:57:08  <antimatroidl> yeah i like reading input with just a space between stuff
2012-09-04T05:57:11  <antimatroidl> very easy for me in c++ :P
2012-09-04T05:57:28  <antimatroidl> with information about how much i'm reading also
2012-09-04T05:57:35  <antimatroidl> if that's not fixed
2012-09-04T05:57:54  <antimatroidl> if i have to process brackets/parenthesis i will cry
2012-09-04T05:58:59  <aerique> i like parens
2012-09-04T05:59:43  * aerique goes back to work
2012-09-04T06:02:27  <mcstar> uh oh what did i miss
2012-09-04T06:03:00  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i think i told you
2012-09-04T06:03:44  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i finished my classes 2 years ago, and finally, since this summer ive been at it, ill finish my thesis
2012-09-04T06:04:21  <mcstar> 5 year old education, equivalent to a masters degree
2012-09-04T06:05:39  <mcstar> aerique: am just saying hi, hi!
2012-09-04T06:06:25  <mcstar> i was thinking about continuations, and you came to mind, visited your blog, and it wasnt updated since the last time i checked, that was what i was commenting on
2012-09-04T06:06:32  <antimatroidl> mcstar: yeah i thought it was something like that but i'm terrible at that kind of thing and my friend asked what you do
2012-09-04T06:06:39  <antimatroidl> all i could say was physicist concretely :P
2012-09-04T06:07:04  <mcstar> tell him, computational statistical physics

2012-09-04T06:07:47  <aerique> mcstar: hi :-)
2012-09-04T06:08:12  <mcstar> antimatroidl: http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v103/i3/e035702
2012-09-04T06:09:03  <antimatroidl> i know some of those words :P
2012-09-04T06:09:07  <mcstar> aerique: you wrote a game, right?
2012-09-04T06:09:25  <mcstar> a commetcial one? i remember you said you have plans for it
2012-09-04T06:09:39  <aerique> mcstar: i wish!  definitely have plans for it but no time
2012-09-04T06:09:58  <mcstar> oh, i thought that was your next 'gig'
2012-09-04T06:10:03  <mcstar> i definitely remember that word
2012-09-04T06:10:16  <mcstar> ill look stupid if that wasnt you...
2012-09-04T06:10:20  <aerique> yeah, i had a 3 months 'gig' during the ants challenge
2012-09-04T06:10:40  <aerique> but it wasn't a game, just an ipad app for a startup
2012-09-04T06:11:04  <mcstar> did it work out?
2012-09-04T06:11:33  <aerique> i finished the app and had a good time but the startup sorta died a few months later
2012-09-04T06:12:21  <aerique> i was the 'client' guy and worked together with the server guy.  he left the company a few weeks ago
2012-09-04T06:12:26  <mcstar> i guess most of the startups do
2012-09-04T06:12:44  <aerique> yeah.  it was a good experience though
2012-09-04T06:17:23  <mcstar> Areks: you can use printing to stderr, as in any other language
2012-09-04T06:17:38  <mcstar> if you didnt specifically meant a debugger...
2012-09-04T06:17:59  <mcstar> you can tell the engine to pipe stderr to a file, or print to screen
2012-09-04T06:19:53  <Areks> mcstar: i adjusting debugger in IDE )) it's more comfortably
2012-09-04T06:20:43  <mcstar> you have already done that, or you want to do it? im dont understand
2012-09-04T06:20:56  <mcstar> -m
2012-09-04T06:21:25  <Areks> I have just did it )
2012-09-04T06:22:12  <mcstar> ok then
2012-09-04T06:22:13  <Areks> when i ask i had some trouble
