2012-04-13T07:13:07  <antimatroid> mcstar: i went for a fun ride before :)
2012-04-13T07:13:18  <antimatroid> bailed trying to go over this log thing but didn't get hurt
2012-04-13T07:13:22  <mcstar> good for you, ill try to fit in some sports

2012-04-13T07:13:56  <mcstar> (i hate to say that)
2012-04-13T07:14:11  <mcstar> so instead: have fun
2012-04-13T07:14:47  <mcstar> so effing idiotic saying, we have a similar in hunagrian: break a leg and an arm
2012-04-13T07:14:58  <mcstar> (sounds good when you say it, but it is idiotic)
2012-04-13T07:16:29  <pairofdice> Don't break a leg, or anything else
2012-04-13T07:18:35  <mcstar> yeah dont!
2012-04-13T07:18:42  <mcstar> i didnt mean to imply to break it
2012-04-13T07:18:49  <mcstar> i just wanted to wish you luck

2012-04-13T07:20:15  <pairofdice> Too short to make a meaningful attack on
2012-04-13T07:20:52  <antimatroid> i imagine it'd take a lot to break a leg anyway
2012-04-13T07:21:05  <antimatroid> snapped femur would not be fun
2012-04-13T07:21:54  <mcstar> if i were you, i would stay home, and sit in fron of the computer the whole day
2012-04-13T07:22:05  <mcstar> and talk to ppl who do dangerius things
2012-04-13T07:22:07  <pairofdice> I always get stuck at python challenge #7

2012-04-13T07:25:04  <mcstar> it is too high a price to pay for that kind of challenge
2012-04-13T07:25:12  <antimatroid> mcstar: it's more fun to do the dangerous things
2012-04-13T07:25:25  <mcstar> antimatroid: it is fun enough to hear about them

2012-04-13T16:44:16  <lorill> if only to get rid of all those scanfs... parsing is clearer, faster, and probably easier to maintain.
2012-04-13T16:45:50  <mcstar> ocaml looks horrible
2012-04-13T16:46:01  <mcstar> you could flood a city with lets
2012-04-13T16:46:26  <mcstar> you know you can bind vars in a tuple, right?
2012-04-13T16:47:54  <lorill> yes, where would you use it ?
2012-04-13T16:49:08  <mcstar> instead of ands
2012-04-13T16:49:16  <mcstar> not that i have a problem with your code per say
2012-04-13T16:49:21  <lorill> if it's where i used "and" in the Input module, i'd rather keep one coerce by line
2012-04-13T16:49:26  <lorill> guessed right :)
2012-04-13T16:49:44  <lorill> you could. I'm still new to ocaml.
2012-04-13T16:49:54  <mcstar> im new to haskell :)
2012-04-13T16:50:25  <lorill> i like my side effects, and i'm not fond of the do notation myself.
2012-04-13T16:50:57  <mcstar> well, i wrote something in c++ in like 15 minutes
2012-04-13T16:51:09  <lorill> but yeah, I miss typeclasses. Not being able to print a basic int list directly sucks
2012-04-13T16:51:17  <mcstar> and took 2 days to bring the haskell one up to the same speed/space as the c++ one
2012-04-13T16:52:05  <mcstar> yeah, i was surprised, why i say uncleavasya's own list printer
2012-04-13T16:52:52  <thestinger> mcstar: the crypto programming assignment was actually pretty easy
2012-04-13T16:53:00  <thestinger> took 3 mins after I looked at a drawing of CBC
2012-04-13T16:53:15  <mcstar> it was easy allright
2012-04-13T16:53:24  <mcstar> now try to translate that to haskell
2012-04-13T16:53:29  <mcstar> and you run out of memry
2012-04-13T16:53:32  <thestinger> oh
2012-04-13T16:53:34  <thestinger> I meant the 4th
2012-04-13T16:53:35  <mcstar> it it is fast enought at all
2012-04-13T16:53:50  <mcstar> i havent got around to that yet
2012-04-13T16:54:12  <thestinger> I'm going to catch up today because I want to start 2 more udacity courses on the 16th

2012-04-13T16:55:32  <mcstar> i dont think this is particularly trivial
2012-04-13T16:55:45  <mcstar> (uses unboxed vectors and judy arrays)
2012-04-13T16:55:51  <mcstar> (and ofc monadic)
2012-04-13T16:56:24  <mcstar> and you need the mersenne generator, cause it is fast
2012-04-13T16:56:29  <thestinger> radix trees!
2012-04-13T16:56:32  <thestinger> :P
2012-04-13T16:56:35  <mcstar> and you need to compile sha2 with sse2
2012-04-13T16:56:50  * thestinger still has to implement radix tries for fun
2012-04-13T16:57:20  <mcstar> is that for algo?
2012-04-13T16:57:41  <thestinger> no, just seems like a neat thing
2012-04-13T16:58:06  <thestinger> algo was just graph stuff and heaps + hash tables for week 5
2012-04-13T16:58:10  <thestinger> easiest week so far
2012-04-13T16:58:22  <thestinger> I liked week4 a lot because I learned a lot of graph theory stuff
2012-04-13T16:58:25  <thestinger> this week was... meh
2012-04-13T16:59:53  <thestinger> the programming assignment was pretty silly

2012-04-13T17:03:27  <mcstar> thestinger: do you know how unordered_sets are implemented in c++?
2012-04-13T17:04:12  <thestinger> well, hash tables
2012-04-13T17:04:22  <thestinger> linked lists for buckets I think
2012-04-13T17:04:42  <thestinger> at least in libstdc++
2012-04-13T17:04:51  <thestinger> mcstar: it will be slower than std::set for small sets
2012-04-13T17:05:04  <thestinger> std::set is a balanced tree so I think it has 3 pointers as overhead per element
2012-04-13T17:05:28  <thestinger> and O(logn) lookup/insert/delete
2012-04-13T17:05:54  <thestinger> until n is big that will be fast as hell
2012-04-13T17:06:12  <thestinger> the point where hash tables become faster is probably at least 100k+ elements
2012-04-13T17:06:34  <thestinger> except for integers where a hash is easy
2012-04-13T17:06:45  <mcstar> you wouldnt believe what kind of overhead i suffered form hashtables in haskell
2012-04-13T17:06:54  <thestinger> hash tables suck in haskell :P
2012-04-13T17:07:03  <mcstar> not really
2012-04-13T17:07:05  <mcstar> i mean speedwise
2012-04-13T17:07:10  <thestinger> I know
2012-04-13T17:07:12  <thestinger> I meant speed
2012-04-13T17:07:21  <mcstar> they are ok speed wise
2012-04-13T17:07:27  <thestinger> #haskell will tell you to use IntMap or whatever
2012-04-13T17:07:27  <mcstar> but they took up too much space
2012-04-13T17:07:39  <mcstar> im on #haskell for a couple of days now
2012-04-13T17:08:01  <mcstar> i did some 'comprehensive' study
2012-04-13T17:08:07  <mcstar> maybe ill write it up
2012-04-13T17:08:10  <mcstar> i dont know
2012-04-13T17:09:56  <mcstar> thestinger: storing 10M 32byte long bytestrings in a hashtable/hashmap whatever took like 4-5GB memory
2012-04-13T17:10:24  <thestinger> mcstar: that's a bit ridiculous
2012-04-13T17:10:30  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-13T17:10:31  <thestinger> the overhead shouldn't be that high at all
2012-04-13T17:10:56  <mcstar> that code, i showed, stores key(Word64) and index pairs(Int, 64bit)
2012-04-13T17:11:08  <mcstar> and the whole of the random numbers is in 1 single vector
2012-04-13T17:11:26  <mcstar> which i generate before sha hashing
2012-04-13T17:12:15  <thestinger> with ~10 million elements it should have  ~10 million buckets
2012-04-13T17:12:29  <thestinger> which should just be the overhead of a linked list with ~1 element each
2012-04-13T17:14:51  <mcstar> http://imgur.com/30wsF
2012-04-13T17:15:12  <mcstar> on this you see the red stripe, which is the random vector, with a correct size
2012-04-13T17:15:16  <mcstar> 32Mbytes
2012-04-13T17:15:32  <mcstar> the other stripes are for the Data.HashTable
2012-04-13T17:15:49  <mcstar> 16bytes / key-value pair

2012-04-13T17:41:06  <thestinger> compared to how well optimized everything else is
2012-04-13T17:41:53  <mcstar> are you lookign at the source?
2012-04-13T17:42:17  <thestinger> benchmarks
2012-04-13T17:42:25  <mcstar> yours?
2012-04-13T17:42:34  <thestinger> no, random ones via google :P
2012-04-13T17:42:45  <mcstar> vs. what?
2012-04-13T17:42:50  <mcstar> fortran?
2012-04-13T17:42:55  <mcstar> haha
2012-04-13T17:43:01  <mcstar> .net?
2012-04-13T17:43:04  <thestinger> std::set/map, CPython's hash table, etc.
2012-04-13T17:43:13  <thestinger> mcstar: no, other C or C++ implementations
2012-04-13T17:43:31  <mcstar> thestinger: try to dig up some .net Collections benchamrks
2012-04-13T17:44:00  <thestinger> they don't have the ruby/perl/python obsession with dicts though :P
2012-04-13T17:44:26  <thestinger> writing 'var' in the global scope in python is a dict lookup for "var"
2012-04-13T17:44:31  <thestinger> and objects are dicts
2012-04-13T17:44:33  <thestinger> etc.
2012-04-13T17:45:32  <thestinger> mcstar: the CPython benchmarks are using the type from C code
2012-04-13T17:45:40  <thestinger> to make it comparable to C++
2012-04-13T17:45:48  <thestinger> I think it's still doing refcounting though
2012-04-13T17:47:07  <thestinger> mcstar: gcc uses memory pools for objects under 64K so must of the java/C# propaganda about heap stuff is a lie :P
2012-04-13T17:47:46  <thestinger> meh
2012-04-13T17:47:51  <thestinger> so many visual studio benchmarks
2012-04-13T17:47:57  <mcstar> im not familiar with that propaganda
2012-04-13T17:48:24  <mcstar> anyway, even mono hash collection was at least as fast as unordered_map
2012-04-13T17:48:33  <mcstar> thats why i said look at .net
2012-04-13T17:48:36  <thestinger> ah
2012-04-13T17:48:52  <thestinger> btw make sure to use .find() for lookups
2012-04-13T17:48:57  <thestinger> operator[] is evil for maps
2012-04-13T17:49:17  <thestinger> works like python's defaultdict and adds the key and a default constructed value
2012-04-13T17:49:23  <thestinger> just by looking it up...
2012-04-13T17:49:38  <thestinger> and then returns a reference
2012-04-13T17:49:50  <thestinger> (well that's if it's not in there already)
2012-04-13T17:50:15  <mcstar> i always use find
2012-04-13T17:50:22  <mcstar> and insert
2012-04-13T17:50:43  <thestinger> sometimes the default insert is nice though
2012-04-13T17:50:45  <thestinger> like for counters
2012-04-13T17:50:51  <thestinger> I don't really understand why it's the default
2012-04-13T17:53:48  <thestinger> maybe I should just compare the libstdc++ implementation to the boost one
2012-04-13T17:55:31  <thestinger> I've been using so much crap from boost anyway
2012-04-13T17:56:59  <mcstar> for what?
2012-04-13T17:57:18  <mcstar> do you do real programming, aside from benchmarking, and homework assignments?
2012-04-13T17:57:50  <thestinger> mcstar: I code random things :P
2012-04-13T17:58:59  <thestinger> I should do something useful and contribute to some project
2012-04-13T17:59:34  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-13T17:59:41  *** hara <hara!~hara@d118028.adsl.hansenet.de> has quit IRC ()
2012-04-13T17:59:49  <mcstar> i was thinking about that too actually
2012-04-13T18:00:10  <thestinger> I was going to write a new database backend for pacman but the codebase scared me off for now
2012-04-13T18:00:19  <mcstar> oh
2012-04-13T18:00:26  <mcstar> what doest it have now?
2012-04-13T18:00:30  <thestinger> flat files
2012-04-13T18:00:52  <mcstar> it just got digital signatures
2012-04-13T18:01:03  <thestinger> yeah, those are on the packages
2012-04-13T18:01:05  <mcstar> realatively young package manager
2012-04-13T18:01:23  <thestinger> you can look at the db in /var/lib/pacman
2012-04-13T18:01:32  <thestinger> the sync ones are now kept in tarballs now
2012-04-13T18:01:59  <thestinger> because reading from one file helps caching compared to 100000 files
2012-04-13T18:02:12  <thestinger> local database is still just extracted flat files
2012-04-13T18:02:14  <thestinger> plain text
2012-04-13T18:03:24  <thestinger> it would be 100x faster for trivial things like pacman -Si pkg with sqlite, and definitely a lot faster (5x-20x) for searches
2012-04-13T18:04:05  <mcstar> :( i just extracted extra.db into my home
2012-04-13T18:04:35  <thestinger> mcstar: tar tf extra.db to get a file list
2012-04-13T18:04:45  <mcstar> i thought its gonna be in a folder
2012-04-13T18:04:58  <mcstar> now i have to cherrypic and delete
2012-04-13T18:05:01  <mcstar> fuck
2012-04-13T18:05:04  <thestinger> noooo
2012-04-13T18:05:06  <thestinger> tar tf extra.db
2012-04-13T18:05:09  <thestinger> and pass that to rm -r
2012-04-13T18:05:26  <thestinger> well
2012-04-13T18:05:33  <thestinger> assuming you don't have dirs named the same as packages...
2012-04-13T18:05:48  <thestinger> they have version numbers in them
2012-04-13T18:05:49  <mcstar> package names has long  versio numbers
2012-04-13T18:06:00  <mcstar> damn, my engrish sucks
2012-04-13T18:06:46  <mcstar> i dont quite know xargs
2012-04-13T18:06:54  <mcstar> guess i have to learn it some day
2012-04-13T18:06:57  <mcstar> why not now
2012-04-13T18:07:15  <thestinger> or be lazy and use $()
2012-04-13T18:07:37  <thestinger> mcstar: `yes no | xargs'

2012-04-13T18:16:02  <mcstar> with a bit of vim foo i have the dir names

2012-04-13T22:19:30  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-04-13T22:20:17  <antimatroid> cyphase: you're in #aichallenge #math and I saw you on some game theory class channel the other day
2012-04-13T22:20:26  <antimatroid> expect to be berated with questions some time in the future :)
2012-04-13T22:21:11  <cyphase> antimatroid, what questions?
2012-04-13T22:21:30  <antimatroid> when i get stuck
2012-04-13T22:21:47  <cyphase> ah
2012-04-13T22:21:47  <antimatroid> i have a problem i want an "example" to break if you would be interested
2012-04-13T22:22:00  <antimatroid> it's for a symmetric finite normal form game, but requires some explanation to say the least
2012-04-13T22:22:23  <antimatroid> i assume you know what groups are?
2012-04-13T22:23:57  <cyphase> as in the algebraic structure?
2012-04-13T22:24:03  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-04-13T22:24:11  <cyphase> rusty, but yea
2012-04-13T22:24:58  <antimatroid> in very vague terms you can define various types of a symmetric game based on the structure of its automorphism group
2012-04-13T22:25:56  <antimatroid> i call a symmetry group of a game a subgroup of its automorphism group (which is a pretty horrible abuse of automorphism/symmetry since they're basically the same word)
2012-04-13T22:26:29  <antimatroid> do you know what a transtive and n-transtive subgroups of S_n (permutations on n numbers) are?
2012-04-13T22:26:56  <cyphase> no, you've lost me :)
2012-04-13T22:27:41  <antimatroid> well S_n is the only n-transitive subgroup of S_n since it has every permutation
2012-04-13T22:28:06  <antimatroid> a transitive subgroup is one that for each 1<=i,j<=n there exists a permutation mapping i to j, but not necessarily every permutation of the numbers
2012-04-13T22:28:28  <cyphase> no, you've really lost me
2012-04-13T22:28:34  <antimatroid> hmm :(
2012-04-13T22:28:35  <cyphase> lol
2012-04-13T22:28:39  <antimatroid> sorry :)
2012-04-13T22:28:40  <cyphase> not your fault
2012-04-13T22:29:23  <antimatroid> can i keep trying?
2012-04-13T22:30:14  <cyphase> you can, but i dont think you're gonna have any luck :D
2012-04-13T22:30:22  <antimatroid> say you have two games (N, (A_i), (u_i)) and (M, (B_i), (v_i)) are you okay with that?
2012-04-13T22:31:00  <antimatroid> N and M are player sets, A_i's and B_i's are strategy sets and u_i's and v_i's are utility/payoff functions
2012-04-13T22:31:11  <cyphase> alright
2012-04-13T22:31:53  <antimatroid> a bijection between the two games consists of a player bijections p:N->M and for each player i \in N a strategy set bijection t_i:A_i->B_p(i)
2012-04-13T22:32:03  <antimatroid> don't worry about what form they take
2012-04-13T22:32:57  <antimatroid> each of these bijections induces a bijection between the strategy profiles of the two games

2012-04-13T22:33:55  <cyphase> alright..
2012-04-13T22:34:11  <antimatroid> if you take the set of bijections from a game to itself, the automorphisms are the bijections for which the utility to player i in the first game for a strategy profile is always equal to the mapped players utility for the mapped strategy profile.
2012-04-13T22:34:51  <_flag> Anyone here doing CodeJam?

2012-04-13T22:35:09  <cyphase> already qualified

2012-04-13T22:35:32  <cyphase> even if the two ungraded ones are wrong, which i highly doubt they are
2012-04-13T22:35:38  <_flag> ah
2012-04-13T22:35:56  <_flag> Wait, how did you get 40?
2012-04-13T22:35:57  <cyphase> antimatroid, go on, let's see if i understand enough for the next part
2012-04-13T22:36:06  <cyphase> _flag, both C's and A
2012-04-13T22:36:22  <_flag> Oh I see
2012-04-13T22:36:25  <antimatroid> well these automorphisms form a group for any game (obviously the identity bijection is always an automorphism)
2012-04-13T22:36:48  <antimatroid> in the weakest sense a game is symmetric if the automorphism group is player transitive
2012-04-13T22:36:52  <_flag> I'm stuck on problem 4 (I want to try to get all of them)
2012-04-13T22:36:53  <cyphase> obviously
2012-04-13T22:36:55  <cyphase> :D
2012-04-13T22:37:17  <antimatroid> which is to say for each i, j \in N there exists an automorphism which permutes player i to j
2012-04-13T22:37:26  <cyphase> (that wasn't for you _flag :) )
2012-04-13T22:37:45  <_flag> cyphase: Yeah, I realized that
2012-04-13T22:38:52  <cyphase> antimatroid, the scaffolding is getting shaky, but go on
2012-04-13T22:39:03  <antimatroid> i'm going to give you an example :)
2012-04-13T22:39:15  <cyphase> a.k.a. duct tape
2012-04-13T22:40:53  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/HiAT1PH7
2012-04-13T22:40:58  <antimatroid> that's a symmetric 3 player game
2012-04-13T22:41:15  <antimatroid> sorry, i'll put an automorphism on there too
2012-04-13T22:42:20  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/cmA4y3r3
2012-04-13T22:42:40  <antimatroid> basically you use the player permutation (123) and treat the strategies like they're already "in order"
2012-04-13T22:43:43  <antimatroid> ie. (a,d,e) would map to (a,c,f) since a->c, d->f and e->a
2012-04-13T22:44:10  <antimatroid> so you want u_i(a,d,e) = u_p(i)(a,c,f) for all players i
2012-04-13T22:45:28  <antimatroid> cyphase: now i have this diagram http://i.imgur.com/Q78CF.png
2012-04-13T22:45:42  <cyphase> u_i(a,d,e) = u_p(i)(a,c,f) meaning that it's a symmetric game?
2012-04-13T22:46:35  <antimatroid> the bijection is an automorphism if for each i \in N u_i(s) = u_p(i)(t(s)) for all strategy profiles s
2012-04-13T22:46:37  <antimatroid> that was just an example
2012-04-13T22:47:00  <_flag> antimatroid: did you ever receive a response from Jeff regarding Google wanting to see the top 100 contestants?
2012-04-13T22:47:14  <_flag> Or from Google?
2012-04-13T22:47:43  <antimatroid> _flag: nope
2012-04-13T22:47:52  <_flag> Okay, It's not just me then :(
2012-04-13T22:47:53  <antimatroid> i don't expect to tbh
2012-04-13T22:48:03  <antimatroid> i wouldn't worry too much
2012-04-13T22:48:31  <antimatroid> if you really want to work for google continue doing well in programming contests throughout uni and try to do a summer internship there or something
2012-04-13T22:48:43  <antimatroid> i doubt there's many like a1k0n at google (didn't finish uni)
2012-04-13T22:48:44  <cyphase> i think a clearer picture is forming. so if the bijection is an automorphism, what does that mean exactly?
2012-04-13T22:49:01  <antimatroid> it means that bijection preserves the strategic structure of the game
2012-04-13T22:49:03  <_flag> I didn't even send them anything though, it would make sense if they would contact me asking for information
2012-04-13T22:49:11  <antimatroid> you can define weaker notions of an isomorphism but this does for now
2012-04-13T22:49:14  <_flag> I just sent a reply to Jeff saying it would be okay to contact me
2012-04-13T22:49:47  <cyphase> antimatroid, alright.. why does that matter to your question/point?
2012-04-13T22:49:56  <_flag> I think he just never got around to informing Google who to contact or something
2012-04-13T22:50:05  <antimatroid> i told you, it takes me some time to get there :P
2012-04-13T22:50:13  <antimatroid> have you got that diagram up i linked?
2012-04-13T22:50:17  <cyphase> yea
2012-04-13T22:51:08  <antimatroid> a game is symmetric if it's automorphism group is transitive, it's automorphism group is player n-transitive if is has an automorphism for each player permutation/bijection (note there can exist more than one automorphism for each player permutation)
2012-04-13T22:51:29  <antimatroid> that is obviously a stricter notions of a game being symmetric (which turns out to be fairly unuseful)
2012-04-13T22:51:50  <antimatroid> then a game is standard symmetric if it has a player transitive and strategy trivial symmetry group (more definitions)
2012-04-13T22:52:47  <antimatroid> a symmetry group is strategy trivial if every automorphism that maps player i to itself (but not necessarily all players to themselves) has the identity bijection for it's strategy set
2012-04-13T22:53:03  <cyphase> lol
2012-04-13T22:53:09  <cyphase> that last batch is a bit much
2012-04-13T22:53:11  <cyphase> hold on
2012-04-13T22:53:13  <cyphase> brb
2012-04-13T22:53:21  <antimatroid> i'm just going to finish now, it's going to get worse yet :P
2012-04-13T22:53:30  <cyphase> hopefully i wont forget it all in the next 10 minutes :P
2012-04-13T22:54:50  <antimatroid> so i call a game fully symmetric if it has a player n-transitive and strategy trivial symmetry group
2012-04-13T22:55:13  <antimatroid> in a fully symmetric game, no matter what move each player makes their opponents are still playing a fully symmetric game with each other
2012-04-13T22:55:32  <antimatroid> the analogous statement doesn't hold for the other definitions i have for a symmetric game
2012-04-13T22:56:24  <antimatroid> now, i was kind of hoping if a game had a player n-transitive symmetry group and had a player transitive and strategy trivial symmetry group (standard symmetric) then it would have a player n-transitive and strategy trivial symmetry group (fully symmetric) unfortunately this is not the case
2012-04-13T22:56:33  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/6MJ16hXc
2012-04-13T22:56:57  <antimatroid> that game has an n-transitive automorphism group, is standard symmetric and is not fully symmetric (what a pita right!)
2012-04-13T22:57:57  <antimatroid> now that was all good and well, except there's this novel theorem that any fully symmetric game where each player only has two strategies has a pure strategy nash equilibrium
2012-04-13T22:58:59  <antimatroid> my problem is to show there exists a standard symmetric game with a player n-transitive automorphism group which is not fully symmetric and does not have a pure strategy nash equilibrium
2012-04-13T22:59:36  <antimatroid> but however i assign the numbers/payoffs/preferences in the above game there always exists a pure strategy nash equilibrium
2012-04-13T23:00:01  <antimatroid> so i'm looking for another/more examples of a standard non-fully symmetric game with a player n-transitive automorphism group
2012-04-13T23:00:04  <antimatroid> and that's my problem :S
2012-04-13T23:01:00  <antimatroid> either that or prove that the theorem generalises
2012-04-13T23:01:05  <_flag> Is this stuff all from this class: https://class.coursera.org/gametheory/auth/welcome ?
2012-04-13T23:01:07  <antimatroid> but i don't think it will
2012-04-13T23:01:21  <antimatroid> _flag: i imagine it's quite a bit more involved than what's covered in that class
2012-04-13T23:01:37  <antimatroid> this is a problem that popped up with my honours thesis research
2012-04-13T23:01:50  <antimatroid> i am planning to publish but would like to tie that up neatly first
2012-04-13T23:02:12  <antimatroid> the idea of symmetry groups isn't new although fairly unknown

2012-04-13T23:02:37  <antimatroid> oh i forgot to say, the idea of a standard symmetric game can be simplified from that definition i gave above
2012-04-13T23:03:30  <antimatroid> basically a game is standard symmetric if you can match up the players strategy sets such that the induced automorphisms from a player transitive subgroup of S_N is a symmetry group
2012-04-13T23:03:47  <antimatroid> that probably sounds harder now that i've written it, but it's much easier, let me give the fully symmetric one
2012-04-13T23:04:33  <antimatroid> a game is fully symmetric if you can match up the players strategy sets such that the induced game bijection from each player permutation is an automorphism
2012-04-13T23:04:42  <antimatroid> iff* for both of those

2012-04-13T23:06:35  <_flag> If that explaination is directed at me keep in mind I don't know what half the words you're using actually mean
2012-04-13T23:06:49  <_flag> So it's probably best not to bother trying to explain it :)
2012-04-13T23:06:49  <antimatroid> that was for cyphase
2012-04-13T23:06:52  <_flag> Okay
2012-04-13T23:06:54  <antimatroid> although i suspect it's going to lose him too
2012-04-13T23:07:06  <antimatroid> it took me a lot of playing around to work out a lot of this stuff
2012-04-13T23:07:32  <antimatroid> it took me months to find the one example i have talked about
2012-04-13T23:08:11  <antimatroid> i have a program that will take in game bijections and spit out the game that the subgroup generated by those as the automorphism group but even with that i still can't find another example
2012-04-13T23:08:41  <antimatroid> _flag: i still think maths is useful to do at uni :P
2012-04-13T23:08:43  <antimatroid> cough cough
2012-04-13T23:09:00  <antimatroid> it gives you a much larger toolbox to approach problems with
2012-04-13T23:09:11  <antimatroid> and abstraction has proved very powerful

2012-04-13T23:10:32  <_flag> I'll try to take as much as I can though
2012-04-13T23:10:43  <_flag> Major in math, physics and compsci?
2012-04-13T23:10:53  <antimatroid> i didn't major in pure math for undergrad, i did lots of both pure and applied classes
2012-04-13T23:11:01  <antimatroid> i did cs, economics and maths
2012-04-13T23:11:24  <antimatroid> if the university will allow it it is possible, but i did a lot of overloads (i also did more units than necessary for all my majors so yeah)
2012-04-13T23:11:24  <_flag> Probably a lot of overlap there (although I guess that's true for my 3 as well)
2012-04-13T23:14:34  <cyphase> antimatroid, yea, you lost me
2012-04-13T23:15:05  <cyphase> maybe if i stared at it for an hour and did some research, i could get an idea
2012-04-13T23:15:21  <antimatroid> cyphase: "it's for a symmetric finite normal form game, but requires some explanation to say the least" I wasn't kidding :)
2012-04-13T23:15:37  <antimatroid> i think you'd need to write them down and play around with them
2012-04-13T23:15:44  <antimatroid> there's quite a lot to take in
2012-04-13T23:16:04  <antimatroid> even then i dunno if anyone else is likely to have more luck than i finding the game
2012-04-13T23:16:07  <cyphase> indeed
2012-04-13T23:16:10  <cyphase> it's a good goal

2012-04-13T23:16:26  <antimatroid> i have a few other results anyway even if i don't get that
2012-04-13T23:16:47  <cyphase> what was your question btw? just for kicks :P
2012-04-13T23:17:36  <antimatroid> does there exists a standard symmetric game with a player n-transitive automorphism group which is not fully symmetric and does not have a pure strategy nash equilibrium?
2012-04-13T23:17:59  <antimatroid> or alternatively, prove that every such game has a pure strategy nash equilibrium
2012-04-13T23:18:22  <antimatroid> there is a proof to show that all fully symmetric games have a pure strategy nash equilibrium
2012-04-13T23:18:43  <antimatroid> as far as i can tell their approach no longer words though
2012-04-13T23:19:05  <antimatroid> because it depended on the matching of the players strategy sets such that each player permutation induces an automorphism
2012-04-13T23:19:15  <antimatroid> implicitly
2012-04-13T23:19:25  <antimatroid> they proved it without relabellings of strategies
2012-04-13T23:19:30  <antimatroid> just assumed all players have the same strategy set
2012-04-13T23:19:34  <antimatroid> which leads to...
2012-04-13T23:19:44  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_game#The_general_case
2012-04-13T23:19:48  <antimatroid> that definition is wrong :)
2012-04-13T23:20:01  <antimatroid> and it's written exactly the same in the paper it cites
2012-04-13T23:20:13  <antimatroid> and as far as i know nobody has ever called them out on it because quite a few other people have used it
2012-04-13T23:21:27  <cyphase> antimatroid, you said this is for your honours thesis? for what degree?
2012-04-13T23:21:35  <antimatroid> honours in maths
2012-04-13T23:21:43  <cyphase> phd?
2012-04-13T23:21:51  <antimatroid> i started that in january
2012-04-13T23:21:57  <antimatroid> i'm doing that on something else though
2012-04-13T23:22:00  <antimatroid> to do with diagram algebras
2012-04-13T23:22:21  <antimatroid> trying to find a presentation for a subsemigroup of the partition semigroup
2012-04-13T23:22:42  <antimatroid> or monoid if you want
2012-04-13T23:23:04  <antimatroid> the problem of symmetric games has bothered me for quite some time
2012-04-13T23:23:32  <antimatroid> it first bothered me in first year, people often say a 2x2 game is symmetric if the players payoff matrices are transposes
2012-04-13T23:23:51  <antimatroid> but that's only sufficient and not necessary if you consider the ordering of players strategy sets strategically unimportant
2012-04-13T23:24:12  <antimatroid> to consider relabellings you need to introduce game bijections

2012-04-13T23:24:53  <antimatroid> most people think of fully symmetric games without relabellings as "symmetric"
2012-04-13T23:25:01  <antimatroid> but it's more rich than that
2012-04-13T23:25:40  <antimatroid> ie. matching pennies is an example of a non-standard symmetric game
