2010-12-05T11:08:07  <phreeza> thats weird :D "timewaves"
2010-12-05T11:10:03  <phreeza> did you see the game i posted yesterday? turn based aeroplane dogfighting?

2010-12-05T11:12:59  <antimatroid1> a 3d game would be awesome
2010-12-05T11:13:38  <bhasker> hmm let me se
2010-12-05T11:16:31  <bhasker> looks interesting but too slow to be a lot of fun
2010-12-05T11:16:39  <bhasker> and adjusting the direction every turn is boring
2010-12-05T11:20:47  <phreeza> well if the bots do it, it would be faster
2010-12-05T11:21:18  <phreeza> and i'm thinking more than one plane per team maybe
2010-12-05T11:24:48  <bhasker> yea probabl
2010-12-05T11:28:50  <antimatroid1> making it 3d would be cooler

2010-12-05T12:06:41  <antimatroid1> 4d**
2010-12-05T12:06:54  <antimatroid1> it's not that hard to think about either
2010-12-05T12:07:01  <burny> 3d tictac toe doesn't work
2010-12-05T12:07:15  <antimatroid1> no, it's trivial?
2010-12-05T12:07:41  <antimatroid1> i think i did that a while ago and it was pretty straight forward to win as first player
2010-12-05T12:08:07  <burny> exactly?
2010-12-05T12:08:23  <antimatroid1> what if you needed like a 2d discrete plane in the 3d cube?
2010-12-05T12:08:23  <burny> why not just play the flipa coin game instead?
2010-12-05T12:08:43  <burny> then it's just 3 seperate games at the same time?
2010-12-05T12:09:15  <antimatroid1> possibly some component like that
2010-12-05T12:09:26  <antimatroid1> but i don't think the games would all need to be the same
2010-12-05T12:09:30  <burny> it could possibly work, if you need to create 2 connected 3's in 2 different directions
2010-12-05T12:09:37  <antimatroid1> and you're placing 1 square for all games per turn
2010-12-05T12:09:54  <antimatroid1> i admit it'd be rather crap game :P
2010-12-05T12:09:59  <antimatroid1> but it'd be possible i think
2010-12-05T12:10:11  <burny> possible in what sense?
2010-12-05T12:10:18  <antimatroid1> non-trivial
2010-12-05T12:10:33  <burny> it would be just as trivial as normal tictactoe
2010-12-05T12:10:48  <antimatroid1> i don't think so, but i'd need to play around more
2010-12-05T12:11:10  <antimatroid1> unless you class chess as trivial as tic tac toe? :P
2010-12-05T12:11:23  <burny> well, if there's 3 fields, and you play one piece in each field per turn.. and the fields don't effect each other..
2010-12-05T12:11:33  <burny> that's just the same as playing 3 seperate distinct games, at same time
2010-12-05T12:11:48  <burny> and it's already known that each distinct game is trivial
2010-12-05T12:11:51  <antimatroid1> no, you only place 1 value in (x,y,z) each move
2010-12-05T12:12:01  <antimatroid1> what about nxn tic tac toe
2010-12-05T12:12:12  <antimatroid1> is there a generalisable draw strategy?
2010-12-05T12:12:18  <antimatroid1> or is that open possibly?
2010-12-05T12:12:23  <antimatroid1> dots and boxes could be interesting
2010-12-05T12:12:34  <burny> connect4 n*n still has player1 winning with n>4
2010-12-05T12:12:52  <burny> conenct5 is infinatly defendable I believe
2010-12-05T12:13:21  <antimatroid1> ah okay, although connect games have slightler stricter rules about placing yes?
2010-12-05T12:13:32  <antimatroid1> i would be doing nxn tic tac toe requiring a line of length n
2010-12-05T12:13:33  <burny> no
2010-12-05T12:13:48  <antimatroid1> isn't connect 4 dropping stuff into columns?
2010-12-05T12:13:50  <burny> well, n*n above 2, is always possible to force a draw
2010-12-05T12:14:02  <burny> "conenct 4" is a TM board game
2010-12-05T12:14:03  <antimatroid1> so you can only "place" something on the lowest square in each column?
2010-12-05T12:14:15  <burny> which is infinately possible to draw also

2010-12-05T19:18:34  <antimatroid1> is it always the same game?
2010-12-05T19:18:58  <antimatroid1> i think you could easily fill at least one team from people here
2010-12-05T19:20:27  <Meatkat> I was hoping so. I think I'd be a pretty kick ass team.
2010-12-05T19:21:05  <Meatkat> BattleCode is held by MIT every year, though it's been only recently that they've opened it up to the public
2010-12-05T19:21:42  <antimatroid1> oh crap, i just thought of an awesome ai game but i don't remember the name of the game
2010-12-05T19:22:09  <Meatkat> so far MIT has dominated the open as well... I'm hoping to help change that
2010-12-05T19:22:22  <a1k0n> what is the contest exactly?
2010-12-05T19:22:26  <antimatroid1> you basically owned a home base and so did the enemy, then you could go around and claim neutral turrets or kill enemy turrets that came back as neutral, then when you has x of something, you could create ground or air drones from your base that would try to go into the enemy base
2010-12-05T19:22:40  <antimatroid1> and after a while you could just buy mega things that went out and attacks enemy drones
2010-12-05T19:22:52  <antimatroid1> first player to get one of the easier drones into the enemy drones home base won
2010-12-05T19:22:55  <antimatroid1> it was on play station
2010-12-05T19:23:12  <a1k0n> sounds kinda like moonbase commander
2010-12-05T19:23:20  <a1k0n> but not exactly

2010-12-05T19:25:29  <Meatkat> BattleCode: you control an army of robots of different functions, each of which has a small byte-code limit to the amount of processing it can do per turn
2010-12-05T19:26:16  <Meatkat> the objectives for these robots have different ever year, they've included capture the flag, assassination, building buildings, king of the hill
2010-12-05T19:26:23  <Meatkat> but the rules remain pretty constant throughout, they tweak them a bit every year though

2010-12-05T19:27:28  <Meatkat> All types of robots can move and send messages, then they have more specific functions like shooting, gathering resources, building
2010-12-05T19:27:46  <Meatkat> so some sort of swarm AI, lots of little dumb robots working together
2010-12-05T19:28:15  <Meatkat> additionally the byte code limits aren't always the same, the 'leader' robots have a larger limit than the scouts/soldiers
2010-12-05T19:33:17  <a1k0n> hm if you work for one of the sponsors you can't compete
