2011-01-09T11:30:56  <jmcarthur> did the tron stuff ever go open source?

2011-01-09T15:52:16  <jmcarthur> i made a little map example in the comments of my source code and i thought i'd share it http://hpaste.org/42901/nort
2011-01-09T15:52:50  <jmcarthur> A, B, and C are the current player's bikes, D, E, and F (only D is currently visible) are the enemies. the lowercase letters are walls created by each bike
2011-01-09T15:53:29  <jmcarthur> walls that come with the map (#) are known from the beginning, but walls created by opponents' bikes can be obscured
2011-01-09T15:54:03  <jmcarthur> i would just say obscure *all* walls created by bikes, but there's no point. might as well show the walls created by your own bikes
2011-01-09T15:54:50  <jmcarthur> well, that's not a map so much as an in-game state
2011-01-09T15:56:29  <jmcarthur> oh, and hopefully obviously, . means that tile is not currently visible
2011-01-09T15:57:56  <amstan> here's a thought: walls in the new tron are transparent

2011-01-09T16:00:21  <janzert> then how is it different than the old tron except for having 3 bikes to control?
2011-01-09T16:00:38  <janzert> oh, you mean in the new movie?
2011-01-09T16:01:05  <jmcarthur> the new tron changed a lot of things
2011-01-09T16:02:33  <jmcarthur> they also did 6 vs. 6 in the new one instead of 3 vs. 3
2011-01-09T16:03:23  <jmcarthur> and they could turn continuously rather than discretely
2011-01-09T16:03:26  <jmcarthur> and the arena was 3d
2011-01-09T16:03:42  <jmcarthur> (multilevel, that is)
2011-01-09T16:04:36  <jmcarthur> anyway, i'm not making this to be like the movie. i'm making it to be fun and challenging :)
2011-01-09T16:04:48  <janzert> :)
2011-01-09T16:05:57  <jmcarthur> i just happen to be drawing some inspiration from the first movie
2011-01-09T16:10:19  <jmcarthur> that's also a smaller map than i think would be best
2011-01-09T16:10:52  <jmcarthur> i'm thinking 50x50 and up would be better
2011-01-09T16:11:48  <jmcarthur> well, depending of course on the obstacles in the map

2011-01-09T19:47:29  <jmcarthur> sigh: the map i pasted was just eyeballed, but currently my code is using bresenham's algorithm to draw a line from the observer to the tile, and if any tiles in between are opaque then the tile is not visible. (i'm actually doing bresenham's algorithm in both directions because it's not symmetric). it's not the most efficient thing, but i think it's probably the easiest thing to put in the
2011-01-09T19:47:31  <jmcarthur> specification
2011-01-09T19:49:07  <jmcarthur> sigh: there are tons of algorithms for this in rogue-like games. they are just designed for efficiency more than for clarity
2011-01-09T19:50:44  <sigh> ah i see, so it means that a square is observable if you can see the target's center from your center
2011-01-09T19:53:45  <sigh> hmm... only the engine code really needs to worry about the algorithm, right? I wonder if any bots will get advanced enough to care about knowing what they can see in the future
2011-01-09T19:54:30  <sigh> I would guess not

2011-01-09T20:05:28  <jmcarthur> i think quite a few bots will want to be able to do that actually
2011-01-09T20:06:10  <jmcarthur> for example, if they predict that an enemy bike might be at one or the other location at some time, they might want to try and see one of those locations to verify it or rule it out
2011-01-09T20:06:47  <jmcarthur> or they might try to make it so that the enemy can see as little as possible
2011-01-09T20:07:33  <jmcarthur> but really, that's a top 50 bots kind of thing, at the most, i predict
2011-01-09T20:09:18  <jmcarthur> i think there could be a big divide somewhere between the top bots and the rest of the crop, largely as a function of how well they are accounting for and exploiting this visibility thing
2011-01-09T20:09:26  <jmcarthur> which may or may not be a good thing about this game
2011-01-09T20:10:05  <jmcarthur> i personally think it's a good thing

2011-01-09T20:33:13  <jmcarthur> it occurred to me to learn from past mistakes and make the communication protocol between the engine and bots extensible this time
2011-01-09T20:33:37  <jmcarthur> i was originally thinking of JSON, but it seems to not be rich enough to be simple *and* easy to read
2011-01-09T20:34:16  <jmcarthur> for example, the map would have to either be an array of strings or a single string with explicitly backslashed "\n" all over the place
2011-01-09T20:34:52  <jmcarthur> so i'm looking at YAML now and it's bringing back memories from when i was a ruby guy of how pretty YAML is.
2011-01-09T20:35:24  <jmcarthur> YAML seems to be a good fit so long as everybody can find decent libraries to use with their respective languages
2011-01-09T20:37:21  <jmcarthur> it has much richer data types, and it has explicit document markers so you can use it as a streaming protocol
2011-01-09T21:00:46  <sigh> jmcarthur: language support should be one of the primary concern when deciding on the data format
2011-01-09T21:01:11  <sigh> being able to quickly implement a starter package for a language was a huge advantage for the contest, imo

2011-01-09T21:15:29  <amstan__> jmcarthur: also.. jeff is a little against the json ideas as well
2011-01-09T21:15:38  <amstan__> he does not think there's a lot of library support
2011-01-09T21:15:41  <amstan__> and even if there is..
2011-01-09T21:16:02  <jmcarthur> umm
2011-01-09T21:16:11  <jmcarthur> who cares what jeff thinks if he's wrong :P
2011-01-09T21:16:13  <amstan__> he wants to keep it open for noobs, so he doesn't want to ask them to setup all these libraries before they can actually code
2011-01-09T21:16:27  <jmcarthur> but the libraries make it *easier*...
2011-01-09T21:16:40  <amstan__> well.. he's the one that's giving money and stuff.. so..
2011-01-09T21:17:15  <sigh> jmcarthur: only for the person writing (or rewriting) the start pack
2011-01-09T21:17:32  <sigh> (not advocating either way, just pointing it out)
2011-01-09T21:17:45  <jmcarthur> sigh: that even further supports me, actually. most noobs won't be writing starter packs
2011-01-09T21:18:02  <sigh> but they will be installing libraries
2011-01-09T21:18:10  <sigh> that was the point, I think
2011-01-09T21:18:35  <amstan__> yes
2011-01-09T21:19:01  <amstan__> imagine the average windows user, wanting to code in c++
2011-01-09T21:19:06  <amstan__> he installs visual studio
2011-01-09T21:19:18  <amstan__> and downloads the code.. but it won't compile since it needs this json/yaml library..
2011-01-09T21:19:39  <amstan__> and then the next day.. the forums will be full of questions of that kind
2011-01-09T21:21:21  <jmcarthur> why not just include the lib with the starter then?
2011-01-09T21:21:26  <jmcarthur> that's the point of a starter anyway
2011-01-09T21:22:21  <jmcarthur> (to include everything you need, that is)
2011-01-09T21:23:20  <amstan__> you still need to tell the ide where to compile stuff and so on
2011-01-09T21:23:31  <amstan__> yeah, i guess that could work
2011-01-09T21:23:37  <amstan__> +1 to the idea
2011-01-09T21:23:50  <jmcarthur> well, it sounds like we need to get it past jeff anyway
2011-01-09T21:24:15  <amstan__> yeah, so.. i'll be meeting with him weekly or more(i hope at least)
2011-01-09T21:24:27  <amstan__> so any idea you wanna pass him, just ping me, and i'll tell him
2011-01-09T21:24:35  <amstan__> if he's unreachable other ways
2011-01-09T21:24:35  <jmcarthur> alright
2011-01-09T21:24:48  <amstan__> like.. it's so sad.. all we need is him coming online more
2011-01-09T21:24:53  <amstan__> or sharing his ideas on the forums
2011-01-09T21:25:26  <amstan__> anyway
2011-01-09T21:25:31  <amstan__> i should go back to toronto

2011-01-09T21:45:00  <sigh> http://www.google.com/trends?q=json%2C+xml :P
2011-01-09T21:46:41  <jmcarthur> yaml at the top. json at the bottom.  http://hpaste.org/42914/yaml
2011-01-09T21:47:12  <jmcarthur> oh, and that yaml of course has comments that i should have stripped
2011-01-09T21:47:34  <jmcarthur> the json was generated automatically and it shows
2011-01-09T21:47:42  <jmcarthur> but still, that's the best we would be able to do with the map data
2011-01-09T21:48:23  <sigh> json map should be an array of string, imo
2011-01-09T21:48:34  <sigh> '\n' is not part of the map
2011-01-09T21:48:35  <jmcarthur> that would be a little nicer i guess
2011-01-09T21:48:42  <jmcarthur> still sucks
2011-01-09T21:48:54  <jmcarthur> well, the map is just a custom format, really
2011-01-09T21:49:08  <jmcarthur> the json/yaml "pure" version would be really fugly
2011-01-09T21:49:14  <sigh> well, you can still show the same map if you format the json properly and use array of strings :P
2011-01-09T21:49:22  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-09T21:49:46  <sigh> json also has the advantage of integrating more easily with a canvas visualiser
2011-01-09T21:55:56  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure if most json serializers would make it pretty enough to read the map anyway
2011-01-09T21:57:47  <jmcarthur> then again i'm not sure about yaml serializers either, although i would have better expectations
2011-01-09T21:59:37  <jmcarthur> oh it looks like most of them put each array element on a new line, so i guess it would probably be fine with json
2011-01-09T22:00:06  <sigh> most libraries have a pretty printer
2011-01-09T22:00:10  <jmcarthur> http://hpaste.org/paste/42914/prettier_json#p42916
2011-01-09T22:00:29  <sigh> yes, I was just looking at the python one just now
2011-01-09T22:01:04  <jmcarthur> okay, this could be made to work. i'll go with json
2011-01-09T22:01:15  <sigh> just pass it through in compact form, and if people want to debug they can use their library to pretty print
2011-01-09T22:01:43  <sigh> unless you really don't care about wasting space, in which case just pretty print the whole thing :P
2011-01-09T22:01:44  <jmcarthur> it's still uglier than yaml, but i guess i can't think of any more issues i have with json so superficial stuff like that takes a back seat
2011-01-09T22:01:55  <sigh> :)
2011-01-09T22:02:07  <jmcarthur> json also has faster parser libraries
2011-01-09T22:02:12  <jmcarthur> which would be good for the bots
2011-01-09T22:03:02  <sigh> yeah, that's good
