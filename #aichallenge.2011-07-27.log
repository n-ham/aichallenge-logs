2011-07-27T01:16:28  <antimatroid> yeah, i made it onto google maps, except they didn't use hte data from when it actually drove past me :(
2011-07-27T01:16:43  <antimatroid> (that's me walking across the road)
2011-07-27T01:21:53  <mleise> antimatroid: fascinating, I remember a google car driving past me, too - does that mean ... lol wait a moment
2011-07-27T01:22:06  <antimatroid> :)
2011-07-27T01:22:20  <antimatroid> that was from like januaryish 2010
2011-07-27T01:22:41  <antimatroid> that's also my red car that disappears when you move forward
2011-07-27T01:25:35  <mleise> no I'm not on photo :). Did you notice the 3d-spheres in google-earth recently?
2011-07-27T01:26:45  <mleise> You get street view and other 3d panomara websites connected with google-earth, so you can zoom in to highways around nature resorts or old french villages
2011-07-27T01:28:02  <mleise> I bet in a year or so you can 'drive' along the street view streets while keeping a 360Â° view
2011-07-27T01:28:15  <antimatroid> that's pretty cool
2011-07-27T01:28:21  <antimatroid> i like bings aerial view from an angle
2011-07-27T01:28:40  <antimatroid> i don't use bing, someone had to tell me to check that out, google all the way otherwise :P

2011-07-27T10:35:08  <antimatroid> do people refuse to use the element of relation for elements of ob(C) and hom(C) because they don't want to confuse the "collections" as "sets"?

2011-07-27T15:23:52  <amstan> bhasker: we need to fix the bugs first
2011-07-27T15:23:56  <amstan> like the trueskill one
2011-07-27T15:24:23  <bhasker> oh k, btw i have some experience tuning mysql setups
2011-07-27T15:24:30  <bhasker> so i can help with speeding up the ranking page display
2011-07-27T15:24:37  <bhasker> for 200 bots it takes forever to load
2011-07-27T15:24:40  <amstan> bhasker: go right ahead
2011-07-27T15:24:49  <bhasker> anyway i can have a look at the mysql query being used for that
2011-07-27T15:24:57  <bhasker> and the indexes and the table schema
2011-07-27T15:25:51  <amstan> bhasker: see website/sql for the queries
2011-07-27T15:26:01  <bhasker> k cool
2011-07-27T15:26:44  <CIA-48> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * r3e09f63 / (ants/util/scheduler_test.d worker/compiler.py): added -noboundscheck to compile options for D - https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/3e09f63ca926d1d243b06e1fe4ec00b33e1da566
2011-07-27T15:30:06  <bhasker> hmm i am looking at the code, it seems to pull the ranking page from a memcache
2011-07-27T15:30:13  <bhasker> and there is a function to actually fetch from mysql
2011-07-27T15:30:17  <bhasker> but i don't see it being called at all
2011-07-27T15:30:32  <bhasker> and if the data is coming from memcache why is it soooo slow?
2011-07-27T15:30:47  <amstan> bhasker: i think there's so errors with memcache, mcleopold was talking about that
2011-07-27T15:30:50  <amstan> he might have disabled it
2011-07-27T15:31:04  <bhasker> hmm so the code in git is not what is running on the server?
2011-07-27T15:31:12  <bhasker> the code in git for rankings.php pulls from memcache
2011-07-27T15:31:22  <bhasker> rather ranking.php*
2011-07-27T15:31:32  <amstan> yes, but is there anything that fills the memcache?
2011-07-27T15:33:49  <bhasker> there is a function
2011-07-27T15:33:52  <bhasker> but i don't see it being called
2011-07-27T15:34:17  <amstan> bhasker: grep for it
2011-07-27T15:34:30  <bhasker> anyways the rankings query seems rather complicated hmm would need to explain the query to see what its really doing
2011-07-27T15:34:39  <bhasker> anyway i can get access to the mysql server itself
2011-07-27T15:34:40  <amstan> yeah..
2011-07-27T15:36:03  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-27T15:36:09  <bhasker> can you pm me how i can do that, just looking at the query doesn't ring any bells and its doing like 5 inner joins and 3 left outer joins
2011-07-27T15:36:11  <bhasker> thats a looo
2011-07-27T15:36:13  <bhasker> thats a lot
2011-07-27T15:36:15  <bhasker> of joins
2011-07-27T15:36:28  <bhasker> with one nested table too
2011-07-27T15:36:34  <amstan> not sure about the structure
2011-07-27T15:36:39  <amstan> mcleopold knows this
2011-07-27T15:36:41  <bhasker> though i believe that best way to solve this
2011-07-27T15:36:49  <bhasker> is to do this query once every minute
2011-07-27T15:36:54  <bhasker> and just store it in a table
2011-07-27T15:37:03  <bhasker> or memcache would fix this
2011-07-27T15:37:13  <amstan> we have a query that adjusts stuff every few minutes
2011-07-27T15:37:14  <bhasker> but i am sure the query itself can be optimized too
2011-07-27T15:37:20  <amstan> see manager/manager.py
2011-07-27T15:37:59  <bhasker> off my cuff i am reasonably sure that its probably the count(*) which are slowing the query down
2011-07-27T15:38:19  <bhasker> are the tables myisam or innodb?
2011-07-27T15:38:52  <amstan> the sql template is in setup/
2011-07-27T15:40:26  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-07-27T15:40:46  <bhasker> i would need real data to play with just creating the empty schema is not useful
2011-07-27T15:41:01  <bhasker> is there a db dump that i can download
2011-07-27T15:41:10  <bhasker> then i can load into a db of mine and play with it
2011-07-27T15:41:36  <amstan> bhasker: i can get you one in like 30 min
2011-07-27T15:41:54  <bhasker> that would be good
2011-07-27T15:42:25  <mleise> 30 minutes is not the time he works on that, but the time MySQL will need :p
2011-07-27T15:42:39  <amstan> mleise: i didn't count that
2011-07-27T15:43:00  <bhasker> a dump should be rather fast
2011-07-27T15:43:13  <bhasker> this is probably a small database of the order of 10's of mb
2011-07-27T15:43:25  <bhasker> just get me a full dump with schema
2011-07-27T15:43:31  <bhasker> then i can just load it one shot
2011-07-27T15:43:39  <bhasker> instead of loading individual tables
2011-07-27T15:43:44  <amstan> bhasker: i have to take out emails and hashes first
2011-07-27T15:44:00  <bhasker> ah forgot about that hmm
2011-07-27T15:44:09  <bhasker> privacy issues
2011-07-27T15:44:26  <bhasker> yea please go ahead and scrub the data anyway you like
2011-07-27T15:44:40  <bhasker> i just need the game data and the rankings tables etc don't really care about the player data
2011-07-27T15:45:19  <amstan> bhasker: you can help me if you want..
2011-07-27T15:45:52  <amstan> bhasker: like.. how do i copy a table, and how do i export everything
2011-07-27T15:46:08  <amstan> the other stuff i know offhand
2011-07-27T15:46:20  <bhasker> hmm let me pull up the mysqldump command help
2011-07-27T15:46:27  <bhasker> i have done this before just need to refresh my memory
2011-07-27T15:46:30  <bhasker> give me a couple of mintues
2011-07-27T15:46:30  <amstan> yeah.. nvm, mysqldump should be enough
2011-07-27T15:46:36  <amstan> i need to copy a table though
2011-07-27T15:47:13  <bhasker> i don't think i really need the player table at all?
2011-07-27T15:47:17  <bhasker> the rankings query doesn't use it
2011-07-27T15:47:51  <amstan> you might need it..
2011-07-27T15:47:53  <amstan> might as well
2011-07-27T15:51:40  <amstan> stopping apache too
2011-07-27T15:51:49  <amstan> might go faster then
2011-07-27T15:52:47  <amstan> bhasker: so.. how do i copy a table?
2011-07-27T15:53:11  <amstan> bhasker: yeah, this thing is 300M+
2011-07-27T15:53:13  <amstan> do you still want it?
2011-07-27T15:53:20  <bhasker> hold on
2011-07-27T15:53:24  <bhasker> to copy its pretty trivial
2011-07-27T15:53:38  <bhasker> just CREATE TABLE tbl name <select from >
2011-07-27T15:53:49  <bhasker> it will just create the table with rows from the second
2011-07-27T15:53:54  <amstan> what about the schema? it copies it?
2011-07-27T15:53:57  <bhasker> yes
2011-07-27T15:54:02  <bhasker> let me pull up the syntax
2011-07-27T15:54:03  <bhasker> hold on
2011-07-27T15:54:07  <bhasker> need to look up mysql manual
2011-07-27T15:54:25  <amstan> anyway.. do you still want it though
2011-07-27T15:54:27  <amstan> 380M+
2011-07-27T15:54:33  <bhasker> ouch hmm
2011-07-27T15:54:55  <bhasker> let me just create some the empty schema and see first
2011-07-27T15:55:00  <bhasker> if i really need it then i will ask for it
2011-07-27T15:55:48  <amstan>  /var/lib/mysql is 628MB
2011-07-27T15:56:21  <bhasker> hmm
2011-07-27T15:56:48  <amstan> oh.. that's including some log files
2011-07-27T15:56:54  <amstan> just 475MB
2011-07-27T15:57:05  <bhasker> hmm hold on let me pull pu the syntax for the create table first
2011-07-27T15:57:19  <amstan> i could just get it form the setup folder
2011-07-27T15:57:48  <bhasker> CREATE TABLE new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl;
2011-07-27T15:57:55  <amstan> and i'm thinking to not waste time with a dump, we could potentially just take the aichallenge folder from /var/lib and download that
2011-07-27T15:58:13  <amstan> if you have a fairly similar mysql version
2011-07-27T15:58:18  <bhasker> which version is this?
2011-07-27T15:58:48  <amstan> bhasker: it's the one from natty
2011-07-27T15:58:58  <amstan> Server version: 5.1.54-1ubuntu4-log (Ubuntu)
2011-07-27T15:59:10  <bhasker> yea i do have 5.1
2011-07-27T15:59:15  <bhasker> though its better to get a dump
2011-07-27T15:59:22  <bhasker> but lets not do that right now
2011-07-27T15:59:26  <amstan> yes, but if a dump takes 30 minutes?
2011-07-27T15:59:27  <bhasker> let me create an empty schema
2011-07-27T15:59:32  <bhasker> and play with that
2011-07-27T15:59:33  <bhasker> and see
2011-07-27T15:59:49  <amstan> bhasker: where are you doing this?
2011-07-27T15:59:52  <a1k0n_> i made a playable verison of tron with a dumbed-down AI
2011-07-27T15:59:53  <a1k0n_> http://a1k0n.net/code/tron.html
2011-07-27T16:00:00  <a1k0n_> (it's still a bastard tho)
2011-07-27T16:00:02  <bhasker> oh my box?
2011-07-27T16:00:05  <bhasker> on my box?
2011-07-27T16:00:07  <amstan> bhasker: you could potentially get a vm and install the whole system, there's a script that does it
2011-07-27T16:00:26  <bhasker> i have similar stuff to do it, don't worry about it
2011-07-27T16:00:43  <amstan> a1k0n_: i died
2011-07-27T16:01:08  <amstan> a1k0n_: a little laggy though
2011-07-27T16:01:19  <a1k0n_> i only tested it in chrome so far
2011-07-27T16:01:29  <a1k0n_> its looking ahead 3 moves
2011-07-27T16:01:29  <amstan> a1k0n_: you should only take the inputs when the frame changes
2011-07-27T16:01:36  <a1k0n_> i queue inputs
2011-07-27T16:01:40  <a1k0n_> so you can wind around stuff
2011-07-27T16:01:49  <a1k0n_> don't hold down arrows
2011-07-27T16:02:01  <amstan> yeah, that's a little weird
2011-07-27T16:02:02  <a1k0n_> oh heh that probably makes it unplayable if you do
2011-07-27T16:02:20  <a1k0n_> i'll tweak it.  lunchtime.
2011-07-27T16:02:39  <bhasker> heh
2011-07-27T16:05:24  <mleise> a1k0n_: no don't tweak it, i felt comfortable with the controls

2011-07-27T16:34:21  <mathis> hey, after leaving the beta will there be anything to prevent one from hardcoding the ~50 maps into your bot and then let it recognice the one it's playing?
2011-07-27T16:35:22  <amstan> mathis: well.. except it'll do very badly
2011-07-27T16:35:39  <amstan> there's no THE 50 maps
2011-07-27T16:35:45  <amstan> they're just a random batch

2011-07-27T16:39:30  <amstan> bhasker: it happens every time someone loads the rankings

2011-07-27T23:47:01  <mleise> janzert: me too until Walter explained something and said as a side-note that in D2 even in release mode -noboundscheck has to be used.
2011-07-27T23:47:09  <mleise> Better safe than sorry ;)
