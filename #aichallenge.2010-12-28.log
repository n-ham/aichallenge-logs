2010-12-28T16:26:42  <dmj111> hey mega1.  logging in org-mode format is a super idea.
2010-12-28T16:27:22  <mega1> dmj111, hello
2010-12-28T16:27:27  <dmj111> i was considering logging to s-exps, to try to analyze the log easier... but that looks pretty nice.
2010-12-28T16:27:45  <mega1> I used org-mode like that for tron first
2010-12-28T16:28:03  <delt0r_> I use s-exps for my data and config files for my game
2010-12-28T16:28:07  <mega1> it's not super convenient, but couldn't find a better way to inspect alpha-beta's brain
2010-12-28T16:28:57  <dmj111> my log files from planetwars were huge... opening them in emacs was bad enough, let alone using org.
2010-12-28T16:29:12  <dmj111> delt0r_: nice :)
2010-12-28T16:29:32  <delt0r_> could help the temptation of adding a few "fetures"
2010-12-28T16:29:44  <delt0r_> it even has lambadas
2010-12-28T16:29:52  <mega1> sure, they are big. Just writing the logs takes a long time. I only enabled loggin when needed.
2010-12-28T16:30:36  <dmj111> yes.  my failsafe was the logging had to be enabled from the command line, that way I never accidentally submitted with it turned on.
2010-12-28T16:31:19  <delt0r_> so org-mode format? my google foo is broken

2010-12-28T16:32:09  <dmj111> not so much a format, but search for org-mode and emacs

2010-12-28T16:32:35  <delt0r_> right
2010-12-28T16:32:50  <dmj111> so it can hide or fold whole sections of the outline at a time.

2010-12-28T16:39:00  <delt0r_> dmj111: any preference for the type of game for next round?

2010-12-28T16:43:23  <delt0r_> ^ open question for all
2010-12-28T16:44:14  <dmj111> not too much on the type of game.  My main interest is that it is accessible, and that there isn't an obviously best strategy.

2010-12-28T16:45:37  <delt0r_> so something quite dynamic like a RTS..with limited physics is not out of the question then?
2010-12-28T16:46:50  <dmj111> I think that sounds interesting.  The biggest thing, for this contest, is that people aren't scared off because it sounds too hard.  (in my opinion)

2010-12-28T16:48:19  <delt0r_> thats what i am worried about
2010-12-28T16:48:47  <delt0r_> if its too hard to "control" units... then you don't even get to strategy
2010-12-28T16:49:32  <delt0r_> However choosing the right parameters can make it more of a "xtra 4 xperts"
2010-12-28T16:49:49  <delt0r_> ie approximatily start/stop/turn
2010-12-28T16:50:07  <dmj111> When say too hard, I mean like getting a program to play a valid chess game is pretty hard.  But for planetwars, the starter pack was a 40-50 line program that played a "Valid" game.

2010-12-28T16:51:04  <dmj111> it is a tricky thing though.  Make it easy to get started, but hard to get good at it.
2010-12-28T16:51:54  <delt0r_> Oh well
2010-12-28T16:52:16  <delt0r_> then i may have nailed it... The basic rage bot is about 50 lines of code
2010-12-28T16:52:36  <delt0r_> but it will lose to even slightly smart tactics
2010-12-28T16:53:17  <dmj111> do you have a link handy?
2010-12-28T16:53:23  <dmj111> I have to go soon, but will check it out.
2010-12-28T16:54:36  <delt0r_> I havn't put it out yet
2010-12-28T16:54:41  <delt0r_> I am tring to polish it...
2010-12-28T16:54:50  <delt0r_> full human mode+tcp etc
2010-12-28T16:55:05  <delt0r_> online play against others...
2010-12-28T16:55:29  <delt0r_> Work has interfeared again... but hopefully before the end of the week
2010-12-28T16:58:27  <dmj111> cool.  I keep an eye out to see how things are going.
