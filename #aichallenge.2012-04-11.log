2012-04-11T01:28:48  <SimonT> I don't suppose anyone has any idea when the next challenge will be and what it'll be?
2012-04-11T01:29:37  <mleise> I have an idea
2012-04-11T01:30:42  <mleise> You can get an RSS feed from the announcements forum on aichallenge.org I think
2012-04-11T01:31:24  <mleise> other than that ... maybe ... I'd say ... end of the year and ... something around a 2d space shooter with projectiles/missiles
2012-04-11T01:31:35  <mleise> oh and asteroids flying around
2012-04-11T01:32:51  <mleise> Look at xpilot, that was inspiration to one of the game ideas for the next contest. While the next game is not set in stone, it is likely to be some clone of that
2012-04-11T01:33:23  <mleise> Currently I think, the organizers try to make AI Challenge a proper non-profit organization in Canada

2012-04-11T10:14:47  <thestinger> hi
2012-04-11T10:14:58  <mcstar> still doing crypto?
2012-04-11T10:14:58  <thestinger> mcstar: loving the algo+crypto classes btw :)
2012-04-11T10:14:59  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-11T10:15:07  <mcstar> i dropped algo
2012-04-11T10:15:18  <mcstar> i was late last week
2012-04-11T10:15:32  <mcstar> and couldnt afford time to it this time
2012-04-11T10:15:51  <thestinger> yeah, lots of videos to watch
2012-04-11T10:16:14  <thestinger> I really liked the strongly connected component thing
2012-04-11T10:16:19  <mcstar> week3 prog. assignment was fine
2012-04-11T10:16:41  <mcstar> strongly connected what?
2012-04-11T10:16:44  <mcstar> algo?
2012-04-11T10:17:02  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-11T10:17:10  <mcstar> i dont think i saw that one
2012-04-11T10:17:17  <thestinger> parts of a directed graph where you can get to/from everywhere
2012-04-11T10:17:26  <thestinger> a -> b -> a
2012-04-11T10:17:38  <mcstar> i did the crypto optional prog. assignemnt in c++,haskell,f#,python
2012-04-11T10:17:53  <thestinger> the brute force hash one?
2012-04-11T10:17:57  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-11T10:18:17  <thestinger> I haven't done problem set 4 yet for crypto
2012-04-11T10:18:21  <thestinger> I have for the algo class
2012-04-11T10:18:23  <thestinger> that was the SCC one
2012-04-11T10:18:24  <mcstar> neither did i
2012-04-11T10:18:54  <mcstar> f# was a bit faster than c++
2012-04-11T10:19:01  <mcstar> python was fast but ate a lot of memory
2012-04-11T10:19:08  <mcstar> haskell had very slow sha256
2012-04-11T10:19:11  <thestinger> which lib did you use?
2012-04-11T10:19:13  <thestinger> crypto++?
2012-04-11T10:19:16  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-11T10:19:27  <thestinger> I think crypto++ is fairly slow at most things
2012-04-11T10:19:35  <thestinger> it also spewed out a ton of warnings when I compiled :)
2012-04-11T10:20:09  <mcstar> really?
2012-04-11T10:20:26  <mcstar> wait, did you compile the lib for yourself?
2012-04-11T10:20:35  <thestinger> no, when I compiled my little program
2012-04-11T10:20:46  <thestinger> using gcc 4.7 (I think they just haven't caught up)
2012-04-11T10:20:48  <mcstar> i havent noticed any warning
2012-04-11T10:20:51  <mcstar> ah
2012-04-11T10:21:01  <mcstar> i have 4.7 too
2012-04-11T10:21:45  <mcstar> no warnings here
2012-04-11T10:21:52  <thestinger> did you use their hex dump thing?
2012-04-11T10:22:01  <thestinger> CryptoPP::HexEncoder
2012-04-11T10:22:09  <mcstar> CryptoPP::SHA256 sha;
2012-04-11T10:22:15  <mcstar> sha.CalculateDigest(output, input, 32);
2012-04-11T10:22:17  <mcstar> thats it
2012-04-11T10:22:52  <mcstar> http://sprunge.us/ZTZh
2012-04-11T10:23:14  <thestinger> ah, I used their code for printing it
2012-04-11T10:23:23  <thestinger> that's where the warnings come from now that I actually read them :P
2012-04-11T10:24:03  <mcstar> i found the crypto++ documentation awful, so i didnt read it
2012-04-11T10:24:22  <thestinger> yeah, if I did it again I would just use openssl
2012-04-11T10:26:33  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/xfXqwi5fXncxMKSfugnm/ that was my code for the crypto one
2012-04-11T10:26:46  <thestinger> it's just an application for DFS (the topics were BFS and DFS basically)
2012-04-11T10:27:23  <thestinger> you go once through the graph and order the nodes (1 for the first with no unexplored nodes)
2012-04-11T10:27:25  <mcstar> ?that was my code for the crypto one
2012-04-11T10:27:37  <thestinger> mcstar: I know :P
2012-04-11T10:27:47  <thestinger> I really liked the algo one though
2012-04-11T10:27:52  <thestinger> I wasted some time making it fast
2012-04-11T10:28:10  <mcstar> thestinger: you said the pasted code is for the crypto one
2012-04-11T10:28:16  <mcstar> but i saw some graph stuff
2012-04-11T10:28:20  <mcstar> i mean i see
2012-04-11T10:28:24  <thestinger> oh, my brain messed up
2012-04-11T10:29:09  <thestinger> it uses up a huge amount of memory
2012-04-11T10:29:20  <thestinger> at first reading in the input data took 8s
2012-04-11T10:29:37  <mcstar> haha
2012-04-11T10:29:40  <thestinger> using Boost.Spirit gets that down to 0.6s
2012-04-11T10:30:18  <mcstar> well, i dont want to waste time on algo, since i decided not to do it
2012-04-11T10:30:31  <mcstar> i hope you understand
2012-04-11T10:30:35  <thestinger> yeah :)
2012-04-11T10:30:57  <mcstar> anyway, this problem was my first monadic haskell stuff
2012-04-11T10:31:14  <mcstar> oh, and System.Random is slow too
2012-04-11T10:31:16  <mcstar> beware
2012-04-11T10:31:26  <thestinger> heh
2012-04-11T10:31:30  <mcstar> i changed it to mersenne-random package
2012-04-11T10:32:07  <mcstar> thestinger: do you know about monadic lifeters?
2012-04-11T10:32:12  <mcstar> lifters
2012-04-11T10:32:24  <thestinger> sort of, I've read articles but haven't really coded much haskell
2012-04-11T10:32:47  <mcstar> i didnt have to use them so far
2012-04-11T10:32:56  <mcstar> but seems to me its  pita
2012-04-11T10:33:00  <thestinger> that's the monad transformer stuff iirc
2012-04-11T10:33:03  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-11T10:33:06  <thestinger> I looked over it but never used it
2012-04-11T10:33:52  <mcstar> im in a bit of a struggle, not sure what should i pursue first, haskell or f#
2012-04-11T10:34:11  <mcstar> cause f# looks a bit messed up, but quite fast, and has the whole .net
2012-04-11T10:39:09  <antimatroid> mcstar: you're alive!
2012-04-11T10:39:21  <thestinger> I ended up discovering a weird, scary corner of C++
2012-04-11T10:39:27  <thestinger> incomplete types :)
2012-04-11T10:40:01  <mcstar> antimatroid: hi!
2012-04-11T10:40:03  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/UNiU this tiny example compiles with gcc and clang and gives no warning (no matter how many switches you turn on)
2012-04-11T10:40:09  <thestinger> and it's undefined behavior...
2012-04-11T10:40:34  <thestinger> if you switch map -> unordered_map it won't compile
2012-04-11T10:40:44  <thestinger> but it's undefined behavior with map too
2012-04-11T10:41:58  <antimatroid> mcstar: how's life?
2012-04-11T10:42:17  <mcstar> scuks
2012-04-11T10:42:20  <mcstar> sucks
2012-04-11T10:42:49  <mcstar> thestinger: whats with template<>?
2012-04-11T10:44:56  <thestinger> mcstar: it's a silly example, pretend 'int' is std::vector<T>
2012-04-11T10:45:13  <thestinger> it's undefined behavior to use incomplete types with the standard lib containers
2012-04-11T10:45:19  * thestinger got bitten by it
2012-04-11T10:45:29  <thestinger> I could _not_ figure out why that works with std::map and not std::unordered_map
2012-04-11T10:45:41  <thestinger> with more complex code
2012-04-11T10:45:46  <mcstar> SomeType<SomeType<int> >
2012-04-11T10:46:40  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/NUWb that
2012-04-11T10:46:48  <thestinger> that's still undefined behavior *
2012-04-11T10:48:11  <thestinger> anything like a tree or linked list that refers to itself is an incomplete type during the definition, so you can't use any standard lib containers in it
2012-04-11T10:48:24  <thestinger> but you can use the boost implementations of map, etc.
2012-04-11T10:48:31  <thestinger> just not the standard lib :\
2012-04-11T10:49:00  <mcstar> so how are linked lists or trees done?
2012-04-11T10:49:06  <mcstar> in stl
2012-04-11T10:49:37  <thestinger> mcstar: you can do it with templated types, just not the standard library ones
2012-04-11T10:50:22  <thestinger> if you replaced map with boost::map it wouldn't be undefined behavior
2012-04-11T10:51:48  <thestinger> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9860503/templated-recursive-data-types I actually had to ask a SO question because I couldn't figure it out
2012-04-11T10:53:34  <mcstar> maybe you can do it with a mutually recursive solution
2012-04-11T10:53:58  <thestinger> mcstar: no, because it still needs itself defined to be complete
2012-04-11T10:54:14  <thestinger> the answers suggested using a smart pointer, which works (but adds overhead)
2012-04-11T10:54:36  <thestinger> the real solution was just using the boost container library, which doesn't have that rule
2012-04-11T10:55:24  <thestinger> I think implementing containers that work in that case is hard, so they said it was undefined behavior to make them easier to implement
2012-04-11T10:57:08  <mcstar> did you look at the boost implementation?

2012-04-11T10:58:37  <mcstar> anyway, all that template crap and OOP design patterns and c++ corner cases makes me puke
2012-04-11T10:58:49  <thestinger> yeah, this really put me off the language
2012-04-11T10:59:05  <thestinger> the fact that neither gcc or clang gives a warning for something that's apparently clearly undefined
2012-04-11T11:00:42  <mcstar> how is this done in python?
2012-04-11T11:00:56  <mcstar> i mean how do you write generic code?
2012-04-11T11:01:05  <thestinger> it's not a problem since it's dynamically typed
2012-04-11T11:01:16  <thestinger> ofc there's a performance and safety cost for that
2012-04-11T11:01:21  <mcstar> still, you need to knwo the types sometimes
2012-04-11T11:01:49  <thestinger> it's usually regarded as bad design in python to use type()
2012-04-11T11:02:23  <mcstar> lets say you want to make a hashtable container in python
2012-04-11T11:02:38  <mcstar> and obviously you need different hashing wrt different types
2012-04-11T11:02:48  <mcstar> how do you solve that?
2012-04-11T11:03:07  <thestinger> you define the __hash__ method
2012-04-11T11:03:26  <thestinger> and duck typing takes care of it
2012-04-11T11:03:42  *** dici <dici!~Dici@port-92-204-123-115.dynamic.qsc.de> has joined #aichallenge
2012-04-11T11:03:44  <mcstar> can you define that method on existing types?
2012-04-11T11:03:48  <mcstar> or classes
2012-04-11T11:03:55  <thestinger> you can inherit from them and define it
2012-04-11T11:04:15  <mcstar> i dont get it
2012-04-11T11:04:24  <mcstar> lets say you want to use integers as a key
2012-04-11T11:04:34  <thestinger> so, the dict calls __hash__ and finds the bucket
2012-04-11T11:04:37  <mcstar> how do you make sure int will have __hash__
2012-04-11T11:04:47  <thestinger> mcstar: it just calls it
2012-04-11T11:04:52  <thestinger> if it doesn't have it, an exception is thrown
2012-04-11T11:05:00  <mcstar> i know
2012-04-11T11:05:08  <mcstar> but how do you make an int have __hash__
2012-04-11T11:05:24  <thestinger> you mean for a user-defined type?
2012-04-11T11:05:29  <mcstar> no, for int
2012-04-11T11:05:35  <thestinger> but int has it :P
2012-04-11T11:05:36  <mcstar> but you dont use a built in dict
2012-04-11T11:05:41  <mcstar> you do it yourself
2012-04-11T11:06:05  <thestinger> you have to inherit from the built-ins to add stuff to them
2012-04-11T11:06:24  <thestinger> if pypy was the reference implementation that might not be the way things are
2012-04-11T11:06:53  <mcstar> so if i want a mydict, that calls __myhash__ on its objects, basically couldnt use built-in types with mydict
2012-04-11T11:07:42  <mcstar> or, i should use if(typeof(obj)=='int') return obj.__hash__()

2012-04-11T11:11:23  <thestinger> it sucks that the solution for performance problems is "write stuff in C"

2012-04-11T11:12:31  <mcstar> but i definitely gonna use it where i would have used bash
2012-04-11T11:12:47  <mcstar> (for >2 lines of scripts)
2012-04-11T11:13:04  <mcstar> bash sucks
2012-04-11T11:13:16  <mcstar> i mean last time i run into it i was pulling out my hair
2012-04-11T11:13:26  <thestinger> yeah, bash is pretty awful :P
2012-04-11T11:21:32  <mcstar> i should write something for windows and sell it
2012-04-11T11:22:22  <thestinger> or an iphone app :P
2012-04-11T11:22:33  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-11T11:22:42  <mcstar> im not sure what though
2012-04-11T11:23:32  <mcstar> maybe a good tiling wm helper for developers
2012-04-11T11:23:49  <mcstar> i dont think windows progrmmers know the benefit
2012-04-11T11:24:18  <mcstar> so theres a possible market for that, if the softw. would be real high quality

2012-04-11T11:25:45  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-11T11:26:06  <thestinger> I never really used it though
2012-04-11T11:26:42  <mcstar> do you have some secret money making idea?
2012-04-11T11:26:48  <thestinger> nope :(
2012-04-11T11:27:13  <mcstar> yeah, dont let anyone know it
2012-04-11T11:28:18  <thestinger> the issue with iphone apps is that you need OS X
2012-04-11T11:28:37  <thestinger> and ofc an ipad/iphone...
2012-04-11T11:29:09  <mcstar> the issue is that i have absolutely no idea for a mobile app
2012-04-11T11:29:15  <mcstar> other than some farting apps
2012-04-11T11:29:21  <mcstar> but that has already been done
2012-04-11T11:29:41  <mcstar> or 'instant nude pictures'
2012-04-11T11:29:51  <thestinger> they censor nudity :P
2012-04-11T11:30:24  <mcstar> hm, so the idea is an alternate AppStore?
2012-04-11T11:30:50  <thestinger> mcstar: it exists (cydia) but you have to jailbreak
2012-04-11T11:32:33  <thestinger> I should make a tablet game
2012-04-11T11:34:46  <mcstar> lets just write another opensource theorem prover in haskell in the meantime
2012-04-11T11:35:04  <thestinger> lol
2012-04-11T11:35:10  <thestinger> I'm actually thinking about a game now
2012-04-11T11:35:18  <thestinger> there are no good strategy games for the ipad
2012-04-11T11:35:24  <thestinger> just arcade/casual stuff like risk
2012-04-11T11:35:46  <thestinger> and it's a perfect platform for an overhead view + clicky interface
2012-04-11T11:35:55  <mcstar> thestinger: like, sitting down with buddies an playing a collborative strategy game?
2012-04-11T11:35:58  <mcstar> over wifi?
2012-04-11T11:36:07  <mcstar> and*
2012-04-11T11:36:22  <mcstar> that would be kinda cool
2012-04-11T11:36:26  <thestinger> or against the AI
2012-04-11T11:36:30  <mcstar> ah
2012-04-11T11:36:33  <mcstar> that would suck
2012-04-11T11:36:42  <thestinger> lol
2012-04-11T11:36:48  <mcstar> you can do that with anything
2012-04-11T11:37:13  <mcstar> you have to incorporate the uniqe nature of the ipad
2012-04-11T11:37:19  <thestinger> but the only fun part would be implementing the AI
2012-04-11T11:38:07  <mcstar> lets write a multiplayer hex game
2012-04-11T11:39:49  <thestinger> hmm
2012-04-11T11:40:19  <mcstar> or, lets port red alert to ipad
2012-04-11T11:40:55  <mcstar> a google search reveals a lot of strategy games for the ipad though
2012-04-11T11:41:03  <mcstar> so i will just forget about this
2012-04-11T11:41:56  <mcstar> i have a better idea: solve the automatic parallelization problem

2012-04-11T13:10:18  <amstan> haskell
2012-04-11T13:10:34  <mleise> well, the argument was that multi-core systems can easily exploited with pure functiona languages
2012-04-11T13:11:00  <mcstar> it is never easy
2012-04-11T13:11:04  <mleise> where imperative languages run into race-conditions that will kill patients in hospitals
2012-04-11T13:11:05  <mcstar> afaik it is hot research
2012-04-11T13:11:06  <thestinger> mleise: but GPU programming is imperative, with manual memory management
2012-04-11T13:11:16  <mcstar> some languages support more automatic parallelization than others
2012-04-11T13:12:15  <mleise> GPU programming ... well you just write a filter kernel and have no write access to anything other than your current pixel
2012-04-11T13:12:18  <mcstar> mleise: one solution to that is STM, like in clojure
2012-04-11T13:12:23  <mcstar> but it has a performance hit
2012-04-11T13:12:30  <mleise> STM means?
2012-04-11T13:12:40  <mcstar> software transactional memory
2012-04-11T13:12:53  <mcstar> and you never have to lock anything again

2012-04-11T13:15:43  <mleise> pypy uses a lot more RAM than python if I read that correctly
2012-04-11T13:15:49  <thestinger> mleise: due to the JIT
2012-04-11T13:15:53  <thestinger> but objects consume less memory

2012-04-11T13:17:24  <mcstar> i dont think any of that deserves 'uber cool'
2012-04-11T13:17:38  <thestinger> yeah, I wouldn't call python cool :P
2012-04-11T13:17:48  <thestinger> it's clean/consistent and pragmatic
2012-04-11T13:17:56  <thestinger> at least compared to most other languages
2012-04-11T13:18:06  <mcstar> it is easy too
2012-04-11T13:18:15  <mleise> Sure, and that's uber cool alltogether
2012-04-11T13:18:22  <mleise> Java is uber cool too.
2012-04-11T13:18:24  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, but I think that's because of how consistent it is
2012-04-11T13:18:31  <mcstar> yeah ok, sry for asking mleise
2012-04-11T13:18:35  <thestinger> since the same syntax is used everywhere
2012-04-11T13:18:40  <mcstar> thestinger: lisp
2012-04-11T13:18:58  <mcstar> you brought up syntax...
2012-04-11T13:20:23  <thestinger> mcstar: python reads like pseudo-code/english though
2012-04-11T13:20:31  <mcstar> sorta, true dat
2012-04-11T13:20:40  <mcstar> i just said that the other day on #python
2012-04-11T13:20:48  <thestinger> haskell uses too many weird characters and operators to be that readable
2012-04-11T13:20:48  <mcstar> we had a great discussion
2012-04-11T13:20:51  <mcstar> nice folks there
2012-04-11T13:21:02  <thestinger> I'm not sure why haskell uses || and && for example
2012-04-11T13:21:09  <thestinger> since it's not like it has much of a C legacy
2012-04-11T13:21:18  <mcstar> it has ML legacy
2012-04-11T13:21:23  <mleise> maybe it is more readable that way?
2012-04-11T13:21:35  <mcstar> ah no
2012-04-11T13:21:40  <mcstar> it has guards: |
2012-04-11T13:21:55  <mcstar> and bitwise operators .|. .&.
2012-04-11T13:22:07  <mcstar> exponention ^ ^^^ **
2012-04-11T13:22:09  <amstan> i really hate the lambda symbol
2012-04-11T13:22:12  <mcstar> exponentiation
2012-04-11T13:22:15  <mcstar> \
2012-04-11T13:22:20  <amstan> \ doesn't look like a lambda, unless you use it with ,\
2012-04-11T13:22:22  <thestinger> mcstar: but the bitwise stuff has keywords, doesn't it?
2012-04-11T13:22:22  <mleise> λ
2012-04-11T13:22:28  <thestinger> mcstar: well, function names*
2012-04-11T13:22:32  <mcstar> thestinger: i dont know about them
2012-04-11T13:23:13  <mcstar> no
2012-04-11T13:23:38  <mcstar> amstan: how are you coming along with haskell?
2012-04-11T13:23:59  <amstan> mcstar: i haven't coded much yet, i was just reading that book
2012-04-11T13:23:59  <thestinger> amstan:  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2603 :P
2012-04-11T13:24:05  <mcstar> RWH?
2012-04-11T13:24:15  <amstan> LYAH
2012-04-11T13:25:53  <thestinger> mcstar: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base-4.5.0.0/Data-Bits.html hmm... weird
2012-04-11T13:26:02  <mcstar> why?
2012-04-11T13:27:30  <thestinger> mcstar: using operators for 'and' and 'or' but not the others
2012-04-11T13:27:56  *** mikewintermute <mikewintermute!~mikewinte@92.40.254.199.threembb.co.uk> has joined #aichallenge
2012-04-11T13:28:18  <mcstar> and dont know what you mean
2012-04-11T13:28:32  <mcstar> everything is a function there
2012-04-11T13:28:48  <mcstar> (.|.) is just like xor
2012-04-11T13:29:18  <mcstar> you mean using special symbols and not descriptive names?
2012-04-11T13:29:24  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-11T13:30:05  <mcstar> well, this isnt that bad i guess
2012-04-11T13:30:23  <mcstar> in ocaml you have to use different operators for different types
2012-04-11T13:30:29  <thestinger> and using >>= instead of 'bind'
2012-04-11T13:30:29  <mcstar> i mean for different kinds of numbers
2012-04-11T13:30:31  <thestinger> etc.
2012-04-11T13:30:40  <mcstar> >>= is nice
2012-04-11T13:30:46  <mcstar> it is graphical
2012-04-11T13:31:30  <mcstar> what something looks like should be the least of your worries thogh
2012-04-11T13:32:12  <mcstar> but i found the syntax better than that of ocaml and f#
2012-04-11T13:32:57  <mcstar> anyway, every tutorial starts with: 'start with no presumtions, empty your mind, blah blah'
2012-04-11T13:33:51  <thestinger> mcstar: haskell often looks like perl though
2012-04-11T13:34:31  <thestinger> I barely understand random snippets of code by looking at them, mostly because of all the weird operators and the culture of meaningless var names
2012-04-11T13:40:09  <mcstar> perl?
2012-04-11T13:40:15  <mcstar> thats mumbo jumbo
2012-04-11T13:40:33  <mcstar> but sopposedly, by looking at haskell functions you immediately know what the code does
2012-04-11T13:40:46  <mcstar> if you dont, than you are just a wannabie haskeller
2012-04-11T13:41:16  <mcstar> jk
2012-04-11T13:41:22  <X-Scale> Anyone interested in the upcoming DARPA's Robotics Challenge ?
2012-04-11T13:41:51  <mcstar> i dont think i have a couple hunderd thousand dollars
2012-04-11T13:42:04  <amstan> yeah.. robotics stuff is usually expensive
2012-04-11T13:42:25  <amstan> i would do it otherwise, i like AI, i know embedded stuff

2012-04-11T13:43:07  <amstan> no, i like baremetal avr
2012-04-11T13:44:06  <amstan> arduino is like the php for embedded, it's high level but horrible and slow

2012-04-11T13:44:30  <mcstar> i guess it is for noobs, who dont know c
2012-04-11T13:44:35  <amstan> yes
2012-04-11T13:48:16  <mcstar> thestinger: do you use xmonad? i forgot
2012-04-11T13:48:21  <thestinger> i3
2012-04-11T13:48:43  <mcstar> im curious whether it work under gnome with composition
2012-04-11T13:48:48  <mcstar> s
2012-04-11T13:48:58  <mcstar> i guess it wont
2012-04-11T13:49:08  <mcstar> but im not sure about this gnome3 stuff
2012-04-11T13:49:13  <thestinger> I think mutter does the compositing for gnome, so it won't
2012-04-11T13:49:32  <thestinger> but you can run all the gnome applications (just not the shell I guess)
2012-04-11T13:49:59  <mcstar> yeah, fallback mode
2012-04-11T13:50:20  <mcstar> i dont care much for gnome, but i wanted to try this combo
2012-04-11T13:50:43  <mcstar> i really dont understand why noone did a composition+tiling combo yet
2012-04-11T13:50:55  <thestinger> mcstar: try compton (aur package)
2012-04-11T13:51:01  <mcstar> (except from kwin's primitive tiling)
2012-04-11T13:51:09  <thestinger> it's yet another descendant of xcompmgr
2012-04-11T13:51:17  <thestinger> it works with any wm
2012-04-11T13:51:25  <thestinger> xcompmgr is crap though, don't bother with that :P
2012-04-11T13:51:33  <thestinger> compton is actually maintained
2012-04-11T13:51:39  <mcstar> i use it for transparent consoles
2012-04-11T13:51:52  <mcstar> i think i even hacked on the code
2012-04-11T13:52:05  <mcstar> or at least i took a look at it for some reason i dont remember
2012-04-11T13:52:20  <mcstar> oh, i hacked xprop
2012-04-11T13:52:31  <mcstar> it couldnt do something i needed
2012-04-11T13:53:32  <mcstar> so annoying to forget things..
