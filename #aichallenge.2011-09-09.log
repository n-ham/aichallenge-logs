2011-09-09T02:39:29  <antimatroid> delt0r: you'll have to talk to McLeopold about food spawn rate, he worked it out a while ago
2011-09-09T02:39:42  <stocha> now, even if the ant challenge do launch, there will be a problem
2011-09-09T02:39:57  <stocha> early beta participants had months to debug their stuff.
2011-09-09T02:40:16  <stocha> if the duration is 3 month, that will be quite unfair for those starting at launch time.
2011-09-09T02:40:25  <stocha> if it is less, it will be even worst
2011-09-09T02:41:19  <antimatroid> stocha: there are always disadvantages, this is perhaps undesirable but nothing can be done about it
2011-09-09T02:41:20  <stocha> so 4 months or 5 month would be more reasonable
2011-09-09T02:41:26  <antimatroid> that's too long
2011-09-09T02:41:37  <antimatroid> i do think we should go for 3 rather than 2 given how long beta has been though
2011-09-09T02:41:47  <stocha> when beta tester had a year to build up their thing, 5 month really is more fair.
2011-09-09T02:42:22  <stocha> okay 3 still give a bit of room for maneuvre. But i think it has to be more now.
2011-09-09T02:43:19  <stocha> i didn't get involved much, so the people who have been improving their bot more regularly have more data to judge.
2011-09-09T02:43:59  <stocha> but the thing is, with more time, even you don't work on it full time, you'll have more ideas. Not mentioning that you do have more time also.
2011-09-09T02:44:23  <stocha> anyway it's still not clear if the thing will launch eventually.

2011-09-09T02:50:36  <antimatroid> delt0r_: i'm trying to work out this spawn formula again, but it's confusing me :P
2011-09-09T02:51:10  <delt0r_> its not clear from the code... well not after about 10min... i have not looked again
2011-09-09T02:51:43  <delt0r_> I was going to just do symmetric... bassed on start positions
2011-09-09T02:51:46  <antimatroid> i think i can explain it, but it'd be worth checking with mcleopold later (i can't explain the implementation, only what it's meant to be doing)
2011-09-09T02:53:09  <antimatroid> delt0r_: do you understand what I mean when I say take a generating set of locations for the map under symmetry?
2011-09-09T02:53:54  <antimatroid> it's a set of locations that spans the set of locations when you take all symmetrically equivalent locations and no two locations in the generating set are symmetrically equivalent
2011-09-09T02:53:56  <delt0r_> not really... if its always folded symmetry yes... but what about point symmetry?
2011-09-09T02:54:05  <delt0r_> rotational I mean
2011-09-09T02:54:16  <delt0r_> aka like we had in planet wars
2011-09-09T02:54:25  <antimatroid> same thing, each square has <= n symmetrically equivalent locations including itself right?
2011-09-09T02:54:46  <delt0r_> yea
2011-09-09T02:54:56  <delt0r_> you mean generalized symmetry
2011-09-09T02:55:43  <antimatroid> yeah might as well go with that, it holds for any, you find a set of squares that aren't symmetrically equivalent to each other but if you include all symmetrically equivalent locations then you get the entire set of locations
2011-09-09T02:56:54  <antimatroid> then you randomly order your generating set and spawn food in that order for the locations, if you spawn food at a location in the generating set then you also spawn food at every location symmetrically equivalent to it
2011-09-09T02:57:37  <antimatroid> if a square picked to spawn food on is not free to have food, the engine waits to spawn food there the next turn it's available to
2011-09-09T02:58:13  <antimatroid> that last bit is the best we've come up with to try and make sure the actions of a bot can't influence food spawning on another part of the map
2011-09-09T02:58:22  <antimatroid> only hurt themselves by not moving and getting the food earlier
2011-09-09T02:58:51  <antimatroid> are you with me so far? the last bit to explain is how the spawn rate works, but i'd like to work the formula out again before explaining that :)
2011-09-09T03:03:27  <antimatroid> delt0r_: using the get_symmetric_loc function it's easy to get the generating set, pick a location add it to the generating set and mark all symmetrically equivalent locations as visited, then bfs outwards finding locations not found yet doing a similar thing

2011-09-09T03:05:26  <delt0r_> what is the food production rate?
2011-09-09T03:05:37  <delt0r_> numberPlayers*food_rate?
2011-09-09T03:05:53  <delt0r_> and is food rate fractional... aka .5 per turn
2011-09-09T03:06:22  <delt0r_> is this interpreted as a probability if it is fractional
2011-09-09T03:07:00  <delt0r_> Finally with scores they seem to be integers. Yet you can have fractional scores --why not have score as a real?
2011-09-09T03:09:03  <antimatroid> nah it's a bit more complicated i think
2011-09-09T03:09:48  <antimatroid> let f be the desired food spawn rate per turn, but that's f food squares for all players and not per player, n the number of players and t the turn, I think foodToSpawn = (f + (t-1)*f%n)%n but i need to check that
2011-09-09T03:09:49  <antimatroid> hang on
2011-09-09T03:10:12  <delt0r_> why...why make it so complicated... this is only going to have bugs and require changing to the cries of "i would have won if the rules didn't change"
2011-09-09T03:10:51  <delt0r_> a simple probabilistic model would have the same average and be simpler...
2011-09-09T03:11:20  <antimatroid> some locations don't have n symmetrically equivalent locations including itself depending on the symmetry
2011-09-09T03:11:36  <antimatroid> and now you can have a food spawn rate not as a multiple of the number of players
2011-09-09T03:11:52  <antimatroid> oh, that's not right either :P
2011-09-09T03:12:21  <delt0r_> so
2011-09-09T03:12:36  <delt0r_> the spawn rate is a little different map to map...
2011-09-09T03:13:08  <delt0r_> also that function has the symmetry specified... ie rotational or tile
2011-09-09T03:13:34  <antimatroid> how?
2011-09-09T03:13:44  <antimatroid> oh get_symmetric_locs?
2011-09-09T03:13:57  <delt0r_> yea
2011-09-09T03:14:00  <delt0r_> I c
2011-09-09T03:14:02  <antimatroid> yeah we need to change over to carlop's general symmetry but haven't
2011-09-09T03:14:09  <delt0r_> get_symmetric_loc
2011-09-09T03:14:13  <delt0r_> is above it
2011-09-09T03:14:14  <antimatroid> but it's just a matter of calling the right function for the given symmetry
2011-09-09T03:14:35  <delt0r_> just assume tile and folded symmetry
2011-09-09T03:14:53  <delt0r_> assumes
2011-09-09T03:16:28  <antimatroid> i think it's foodToSpawn = (f + (t-1)*f%n) - (f + (t-1)*f%n)%n
2011-09-09T03:16:35  <antimatroid> that's gross, i swear there's a simpler way to do it
2011-09-09T03:17:18  <delt0r_> i think everyone is trying to hard for "perfect"
2011-09-09T03:17:39  <delt0r_> just have a stochastic rate target...
2011-09-09T03:17:56  <delt0r_> what is f t and n ?
2011-09-09T03:18:12  <antimatroid> t is turn, n is number of players and f is the spawn rate
2011-09-09T03:19:04  <antimatroid> so say you have n = 5 and f = 7
2011-09-09T03:19:05  <antimatroid> nf = {0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, ...}
2011-09-09T03:19:05  <antimatroid> toSpawn = {0, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, ...}
2011-09-09T03:19:20  <antimatroid> that doesn't allow for squares with < n symmetrically equivalent locations aye
2011-09-09T03:19:21  <antimatroid> hmmmm
2011-09-09T03:19:54  <antimatroid> errr, that's tf sorry

2011-09-09T03:22:11  <antimatroid> although it's harder to make a bot play like that than one would probably first think because of the wrapping
2011-09-09T03:22:42  <delt0r_> I work on stochastic models.. I only need the expectation to be as many wins as losses
2011-09-09T03:23:03  <delt0r_> in the limit of infinite games played ;)
2011-09-09T03:23:39  <antimatroid> personally i want to minimise the amount of "noise" for ranking bots because there's already so much
2011-09-09T03:24:00  <antimatroid> and i've probably had quite a bit of influence on how stuff is done, if it can be done reasonably well easier i'm happy to change
2011-09-09T03:24:14  <antimatroid> we'd need to get mcleopold to agree as well though
2011-09-09T03:24:29  <antimatroid> i do like the ordering the generating set for finding locations to spawn on though
2011-09-09T03:24:54  <delt0r_> yea-- but what does that formular even mean... why not just x number of food per turn
2011-09-09T03:25:38  <antimatroid> because say you have f = 7 and n=5 with all squares having n symmetrically equivalent locations, you can't spawn 7 food locations fairly each turn
2011-09-09T03:26:21  <delt0r_> you going to get a lot of question on the why --lots
2011-09-09T03:26:41  <delt0r_> oh ffs
2011-09-09T03:27:20  <antimatroid> yeah, but i can write up clearer explanations of things like that once stuff is finalised and we're ready to launch
2011-09-09T03:27:29  <antimatroid> then just point people to that, the same is going to happen for battle resolution
2011-09-09T03:27:31  <delt0r_> use the closest value that is a multiple of the number of players...
2011-09-09T03:27:47  <antimatroid> and i think fewer people will care about the food spawning method other than being generally told it's "fair"
2011-09-09T03:27:55  <delt0r_> no they won't
2011-09-09T03:27:58  <antimatroid> yeah, that would work too
2011-09-09T03:28:10  <delt0r_> they won't believe you unless they understand it
