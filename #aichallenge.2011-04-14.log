2011-04-14T00:00:42  <McLeopold> looks good
2011-04-14T00:02:51  <j3camero> Okay, I suppose that's that for this meeting. Any more topics that need addressing at this moment?
2011-04-14T00:03:11  <amstan> j3camero: nope, it's all good i think
2011-04-14T00:03:23  <amstan> i posted on the forums, i pinged the mailing list about it

2011-04-14T00:06:45  <j3camero> Oh neat jbroman came 3rd, while presumably also a first year student.
2011-04-14T00:07:47  <amstan> j3camero: something fishy there.. 1, the db doesn't seem to work, and 2: jbroman is 4th in first year students, while 3rd overall, how's that possible
2011-04-14T00:07:58  <j3camero> I am just looking through the website for RPS contest. Christ that was a lot of work. I basically learned PHP as I was building that thing.

2011-04-14T00:08:24  <amstan> good times..
2011-04-14T00:08:40  <j3camero> I don't know. I may have dumped some of the content as static HTML to future proof it.
2011-04-14T00:09:12  <amstan> j3camero: we can do that, but let's secure the data first..

2011-04-14T00:09:46  <McLeopold> look at the cell maze
2011-04-14T00:09:48  <amstan> McLeopold: oh man.. i was just reading those deleted lines, they use addslashed to prevent sql injection, that's bad
2011-04-14T00:10:38  <McLeopold> is it?  I think some are still in there...
2011-04-14T00:11:07  <amstan> McLeopold: probably, addslahses is not secure for this, mysql_real_escape_string should be used
2011-04-14T00:11:27  <amstan> or parametric
2011-04-14T00:11:30  <McLeopold> prepared statements would be best, but I didn't see that in php

2011-04-14T00:14:41  <McLeopold> That's my site for learning django
2011-04-14T00:14:51  <McLeopold> you know, for zeta...
2011-04-14T00:14:59  <amstan> oh, decent
2011-04-14T00:15:15  <j3camero> Cell maze is cool
2011-04-14T00:15:16  <amstan> man.. i wish i would actually have a project like that, i have to get good at django too
2011-04-14T00:15:34  <McLeopold> I can put it on github
2011-04-14T00:15:41  <McLeopold> We could make it a submodule

2011-04-14T01:37:42  <antimatroid> we have a new scoring method?
2011-04-14T01:39:28  <sigh> no
2011-04-14T01:40:21  <antimatroid> amstan: "Score is going to be determined by how many enemy ants are killed. This might be adjusted after the launch." that is wrong :)
2011-04-14T01:40:29  <antimatroid> amstan_: ^
2011-04-14T01:42:35  <antimatroid> it should be something like... "Score is going to be determined by how much you contribute to enemy ants deaths. This might be adjusted after the launch."
2011-04-14T01:42:49  <antimatroid> plus there is the food bonus
2011-04-14T01:43:14  <antimatroid> although after having played a few games locally, the food bonus is a LOT if the game ends fairly early
2011-04-14T01:43:15  <sigh> where did he write that?
2011-04-14T01:43:23  <antimatroid> in the announcements in the forum
2011-04-14T01:43:24  <sigh> antimatroid: that's what I said earlier
2011-04-14T01:43:51  <sigh> food bonus is just going to be a complicated way of just saying that the last player remaining wins
2011-04-14T01:43:56  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-14T01:44:15  <sigh> so it makes sense to take out all the complicatedness
2011-04-14T01:44:36  <antimatroid> i agree
2011-04-14T01:44:41  <antimatroid> it should be as simple as possible
2011-04-14T01:44:59  <sigh> cool, if you agree then I can count on your evangelising to everyone else
2011-04-14T01:45:09  <sigh> :P
2011-04-14T01:45:09  <antimatroid> what's the issue?
2011-04-14T01:45:11  <antimatroid> live ants counting?
2011-04-14T01:45:41  <sigh> what issue?
2011-04-14T01:46:10  <antimatroid> you want me to fight for what exactly? :P
2011-04-14T01:46:35  <sigh> fight for just saying that if there is one player remaining they just win
2011-04-14T01:46:39  <antimatroid> i can live with whatever now that we have cool battle resolution
2011-04-14T01:46:52  <sigh> haha
2011-04-14T01:47:46  <sigh> my time in melbourne is almost up!
2011-04-14T01:48:00  <antimatroid> when do you move?
2011-04-14T01:48:11  <sigh> flight on saturday
2011-04-14T01:48:51  <antimatroid> nice, have you got a place to live yet? :P
2011-04-14T01:49:18  <sigh> for the first two months, yes
2011-04-14T01:49:38  <sigh> during that time, I have to find something permanent
2011-04-14T01:50:11  <antimatroid> are you working right in the city?
2011-04-14T01:50:27  <antimatroid> that'd be slightly painful
2011-04-14T01:50:37  <sigh> yeah
2011-04-14T01:50:51  <sigh> I'll aim to find something close to the city
2011-04-14T01:51:08  <antimatroid> good luck :P
2011-04-14T01:51:11  <antimatroid> it's so expensive
2011-04-14T01:51:12  <sigh> :)
2011-04-14T01:51:31  <sigh> I hardly have any expenses so I can afford to spend a bit more on rent
2011-04-14T01:51:54  <antimatroid> yeah fair enough
2011-04-14T01:52:17  <antimatroid> jmcarthur has been awfully quiet lately
2011-04-14T01:52:26  <antimatroid> i wonder if he also moved/is moving
2011-04-14T01:52:48  <sigh> i remember him looking for jos
2011-04-14T01:52:52  <sigh> *jobs
2011-04-14T01:52:55  <antimatroid> yeah he went away for an interview
2011-04-14T01:55:12  <sigh> ah well, people do have lives outside of this channel it seems :)
2011-04-14T02:08:18  <sigh> antimatroid: btw, I fixed it so that dead players can't increase their score anymore
2011-04-14T02:08:26  <antimatroid> :)
2011-04-14T02:08:42  <antimatroid> have we got collided ants giving out points to surrounding enemy ants?
2011-04-14T02:09:05  <antimatroid> i really do think that's the ideal thing
2011-04-14T02:09:21  <sigh> no
2011-04-14T02:09:33  <antimatroid> do you agree that it makes sense?
2011-04-14T02:09:39  <sigh> sure
2011-04-14T02:09:41  <sigh> I might have a look at that tomorrow, if I have time
2011-04-14T02:09:46  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-14T02:09:51  <antimatroid> it's not vital anyway
2011-04-14T02:09:53  <antimatroid> not atm
2011-04-14T02:23:42  <sigh> antimatroid: if ants collide, who scores the points?
2011-04-14T02:23:56  <antimatroid> sigh: any enemies in range, including on that square
2011-04-14T02:24:02  <antimatroid> if no enemies are in range, no one
2011-04-14T02:24:59  <sigh> in range after everyone has moved?
2011-04-14T02:25:17  <antimatroid> yes, i would just add them to lists of dead ants if they already exist?
2011-04-14T02:25:24  <antimatroid> then just give points out all at the same time
2011-04-14T02:25:50  <sigh> what about ants which collide in other squares
2011-04-14T02:25:53  <sigh> but in range
2011-04-14T02:26:10  <antimatroid> yep, they all get to give and receive points
2011-04-14T02:26:22  <antimatroid> same as ants that die from battle etc.
2011-04-14T02:26:36  <antimatroid> i'm open to other opinions there
2011-04-14T02:26:39  <antimatroid> but that's what i had in mind
2011-04-14T02:26:51  <sigh> ok
2011-04-14T02:27:09  <sigh> slightly tricky because I can just reuse the nearby_ants method
2011-04-14T02:27:27  <antimatroid> does nearby ants check that square as well?
2011-04-14T02:28:08  <antimatroid> the engine doesn't care about nearby friends which makes it slightly easier to do that
2011-04-14T02:28:15  <antimatroid> because you don't have to not count yourself
2011-04-14T02:28:18  <sigh> *because I can't just reuse
2011-04-14T02:28:55  <antimatroid> a much simpler method is to just allow enemy ants colliding on the same square to give points to each other
2011-04-14T02:29:05  <antimatroid> that might have been what you had in mind?
2011-04-14T02:29:25  <sigh> nah, that just makes things more complicated in degenerate cases
2011-04-14T02:29:32  <sigh> nevermind, I know a easy way to do it
2011-04-14T02:29:53  <antimatroid> ...?

2011-04-14T04:51:49  <Stocha> and i don't think you can collide ants of different colors.

2011-04-14T04:52:20  <Stocha> Ants of same color that collide means poor/buggy bot. So what's the point in giving points for that ? does that means the opponent fight good ?
2011-04-14T04:53:18  <Stocha> arguably killing ants from a poor bot that don't collide suffer the same issu. The neighbors will be doubly advantage. once for scoring easilly. And twice for the free ground

2011-04-14T05:12:36  <antimatroid> so as to not give points to the enemy
2011-04-14T05:12:42  <antimatroid> unless you're out of range of course
2011-04-14T05:17:41  <Stocha> it sounds both complicated and not very important to earn point for suicidals ants.
2011-04-14T05:18:14  <Naktibalda> antimatroid: ant can't walk on food
2011-04-14T05:18:20  <Naktibalda> can it?
2011-04-14T05:18:25  <Stocha> no it can't
2011-04-14T05:18:29  <Stocha> reading the spec it can't.
2011-04-14T05:18:46  <antimatroid> if you have a.b at the start of the turn, they can collide
2011-04-14T05:18:49  <Stocha> but the turn resolution phase wasn't explicit last time i checked
2011-04-14T05:19:12  <Stocha> of course food should be spawned after movements occurs
2011-04-14T05:19:31  <antimatroid> a*.b consider that at the end of a turn
2011-04-14T05:19:37  <antimatroid> at the start of the next turn you would have aa.b
2011-04-14T05:19:42  <Stocha> i mean food tranformation to ant occurs after movement resolution
2011-04-14T05:19:47  <Stocha> and food apears after that.
2011-04-14T05:20:09  <Stocha> where is there a collision in here antimatroid ?
2011-04-14T05:20:19  <antimatroid> then a and b move onto the same square
2011-04-14T05:20:30  <antimatroid> collision
2011-04-14T05:20:32  <Stocha> yeah but that's next turn
2011-04-14T05:20:38  <Stocha> so it's a regular collision
2011-04-14T05:20:44  <Stocha> ah you mean it's possible to have collisions ?
2011-04-14T05:20:47  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-14T05:20:52  <Stocha> fighting collisions.
2011-04-14T05:21:03  <antimatroid> they are all called collisions
2011-04-14T05:21:09  <Stocha> what about it giving no point ?
2011-04-14T05:21:19  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-04-14T05:21:40  <antimatroid> before those ants died and no points were given, now points are given to any enemies in range of all ants that die, from colliding or battles
2011-04-14T05:21:44  <Stocha> i mean a and b are resolved as collided, and fighting resolution + socring occurs after that
2011-04-14T05:22:57  <Stocha> scoring fight is hard enough without those bordline cases.
2011-04-14T05:23:10  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-04-14T05:23:34  <antimatroid> it's easy to do this generally to handle all cases
2011-04-14T05:23:39  <Stocha> what do i mean by not earning any point for anyone when ant collide ?
2011-04-14T05:23:55  <antimatroid> " scoring fight is hard enough without those bordline cases."
2011-04-14T05:24:00  <Stocha> by easy you mean : it amounts to 0 more line of code right ?
2011-04-14T05:24:25  <Stocha> i mean that you have to precise how you will do the scoring for normal damage fight resolution.
2011-04-14T05:24:43  <antimatroid> if an ant dies, add it to the set of dead ants, when assigning points, iterate through the set of dead ants and give points to any enemies in range
2011-04-14T05:24:45  <antimatroid> pretty simple?
2011-04-14T05:25:09  <Stocha> so i you do 1/3 damage, is the same as doint 2/1 damage ?
2011-04-14T05:25:17  <antimatroid> what?
2011-04-14T05:25:18  <Stocha> if there are three players
2011-04-14T05:25:34  <Stocha> one do 1/3 damage to one ant. And another one do 2/1 damage to that same ant
2011-04-14T05:25:41  <Stocha> both player get the same number of points ?
2011-04-14T05:25:48  <antimatroid> i don't understand
2011-04-14T05:25:55  <antimatroid> can you give my an example of what you're referring to
2011-04-14T05:25:58  <Stocha> if an ant die in a turn, can this ant earn points ?
2011-04-14T05:26:03  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-14T05:26:14  <Stocha> a.b.c
2011-04-14T05:26:19  <Stocha> a.b..
2011-04-14T05:26:27  <antimatroid> b dies, a and c get 1/2 a point
2011-04-14T05:26:27  <Stocha> where a b c are different colors
2011-04-14T05:26:32  <antimatroid> oh hang on
2011-04-14T05:26:53  <antimatroid> i suspect just b dies
2011-04-14T05:26:57  <Stocha> well i misspelled my idea. But it's a case also :p
2011-04-14T05:27:02  <Stocha> a.b.c
2011-04-14T05:27:06  <Stocha> a....
2011-04-14T05:27:28  <antimatroid> b dies, a gets 2/3 points and c 1/2
2011-04-14T05:27:30  <antimatroid> 1/3**
2011-04-14T05:28:07  <Stocha> anyway you have to precises all those cases people might wonder about. And illustrate them.
2011-04-14T05:28:14  <Stocha> Colliding ants will add to that.
2011-04-14T05:28:21  <Stocha> unless it gives no points.
2011-04-14T05:28:38  *** jaycobcoleman <jaycobcoleman!d84332d7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.216.67.50.215> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-14T05:29:20  <Stocha> The damage rule is complex enough that i would advise having to independant implementations, and see if they aggress all the time during the game.
2011-04-14T05:29:39  <Stocha> it's not like it is easy to spot mistake just by looking at the game.
2011-04-14T05:29:50  <Stocha> same goes with scoring.
2011-04-14T05:29:56  <antimatroid> feel free to do that testing for yourself
2011-04-14T05:30:00  <antimatroid> it is a good idea
2011-04-14T05:30:03  <Stocha> but it also depend on damage.
2011-04-14T05:31:12  <Stocha> I don't know python :'(
2011-04-14T05:31:22  <antimatroid> you can learn python by looking at it
2011-04-14T05:31:34  <Stocha> i have looked at it. I still don't know it :p
2011-04-14T05:31:38  <jaycobcoleman> python is practically reading
2011-04-14T05:31:43  <antimatroid> well, maybe not well, but you can learn it enough to put something together
2011-04-14T05:31:46  <Stocha> i know java. I'm too old to learn new tricks. and have 0 time for that.
2011-04-14T05:31:59  <jaycobcoleman> java is magic to me
2011-04-14T05:32:07  <Stocha> if you want me to make an implementation in java, no problem :)
2011-04-14T05:32:15  <Stocha> then you'll have to call it somehow.
2011-04-14T05:32:24  <Stocha> but it doesn't sound trivial to integrate.
2011-04-14T05:32:30  <antimatroid> i don't touch java
2011-04-14T05:32:37  <Stocha> unless you things is very modular langage wise.
2011-04-14T05:33:18  <Stocha> jaycobcoleman: java is really only disguised c++
2011-04-14T05:34:07  <antimatroid> minus all the cool shit
2011-04-14T05:34:12  <jaycobcoleman> Yeah I'll figure it out sooner or later
2011-04-14T05:34:27  <jaycobcoleman> I'm just relatively new to OOP
2011-04-14T05:34:39  <Stocha> and minus all the bad shit also :p
2011-04-14T05:34:46  <antimatroid> i'm trying hard to break free from oop
2011-04-14T05:34:49  <antimatroid> but it's so natural
2011-04-14T05:34:57  <antimatroid> Stocha: can't argue there :P
2011-04-14T05:34:57  <Stocha> oop isn't worth it.
2011-04-14T05:35:02  <Stocha> study functionnal programming.
2011-04-14T05:35:08  <Stocha> then learn to do that with c++ and java.
2011-04-14T05:35:26  <jaycobcoleman> Perfect. That's exactly what I can do
2011-04-14T05:35:35  <antimatroid> i couldn't live without operator overloading
2011-04-14T05:36:04  <Stocha> Design patterns are only disguised functionnal paradigms
2011-04-14T05:36:05  <antimatroid> Matrix C = sum(A, product(B, power(D, 3))); just doesn't appeal to me
2011-04-14T05:36:24  <Stocha> how do write that in haskell ?
2011-04-14T05:36:35  <antimatroid> as opposed to Matrix C = A + B*(D^3);
2011-04-14T05:36:40  <antimatroid> i don't know haskell
2011-04-14T05:36:55  <antimatroid> i am really annoyed at those brackets
2011-04-14T05:37:05  <antimatroid> but i can't overload operator precedence D:
2011-04-14T05:37:55  <jaycobcoleman> ehhh I don't remember much about haskell
2011-04-14T05:38:52  <antimatroid> i really want to just make my own language, but so much mehffort!
2011-04-14T05:39:16  <antimatroid> and my own unicode with maths symbols/relations and the greek alphabet
2011-04-14T05:39:32  <jaycobcoleman> I think we all do at one point or another
2011-04-14T05:42:16  <Stocha> computer langages are the same since 1950. only ides and libs have evolved. And paradigms.
2011-04-14T05:42:38  <Stocha> A modern assembly langage would do as well as c++. if not better. with nice ides.
2011-04-14T05:43:39  <jaycobcoleman> I would love to start at machine code and build a language from there
2011-04-14T05:43:54  <Stocha> it's what every language do.
2011-04-14T05:44:07  <Stocha> arguable functional maybe less.
2011-04-14T05:44:16  <delt0r_> antimatroid: you seem to fret over minor syntax quite a lot
2011-04-14T05:44:21  <Stocha> but java c c++ are just nice looking macro assemblers
2011-04-14T05:45:06  <jaycobcoleman> I just mean that everything is based off of something else. Forget everything else
2011-04-14T05:45:16  <delt0r_> Stocha: there are quite a few DSP i have worked with where the asm is better than C
2011-04-14T05:45:34  <delt0r_> I love the FFT instruction
2011-04-14T05:45:44  <Stocha> so that confirms my intuition then delt0r
2011-04-14T05:46:11  <delt0r_> yea
2011-04-14T05:46:24  <delt0r_> well also you often only need a very small "program"
2011-04-14T05:46:49  <delt0r_> so there is really no complexity to manage
2011-04-14T05:47:01  <Stocha> is FFT fast fourier transform or ?
2011-04-14T05:47:06  <delt0r_> yea
2011-04-14T05:47:19  <delt0r_> typically fixed point
2011-04-14T05:48:24  <Stocha> i know nothing about signal processing :p
2011-04-14T05:48:40  <Stocha> i only know logical bit operations really.
2011-04-14T05:48:58  <Stocha> it seems to work okay with ant game :p

2011-04-14T11:45:44  <Stocha> why does a disconected bot doesn't earn point anymore though ?
2011-04-14T11:45:47  <antimatroid> ah, you are like sigh then :P
2011-04-14T11:45:55  <Stocha> like the bot time out, it doesn't receive point.

2011-04-14T11:46:10  <jmcarthur> i haven't accepted yet, but i don't have anything else going on right now, so i will probably take it
2011-04-14T11:46:13  <antimatroid> their score freezes once they're out
2011-04-14T11:46:21  <Stocha> i don't see the point. it complicates the scoring.

2011-04-14T11:46:42  <jmcarthur> so looks like i'll be jumping into the finance industry in NYC
2011-04-14T11:46:48  <antimatroid> it doesn't complicate the scoring, just freeze an ants score if they timeout/crash
2011-04-14T11:46:50  <Stocha> let's say a player that timed out, is still in the game as long as it have ant. It simply auto pass the no move order to all ant. That seems simpler.
2011-04-14T11:46:59  <antimatroid> ah, at least there's potential money there for you :P
2011-04-14T11:47:02  <Stocha> i find that more fair also.
2011-04-14T11:47:06  <antimatroid> i have contemplated running off to finance
2011-04-14T11:47:11  <Frontier> finance 'industry' *cough*
2011-04-14T11:47:16  <jmcarthur> they like functional programmers :)
2011-04-14T11:47:22  <amstan> Frontier: lol
2011-04-14T11:47:30  <jmcarthur> Frontier: heh
2011-04-14T11:47:50  <antimatroid> seems everyone here is going finance
2011-04-14T11:47:52  <amstan> Frontier: have you seen the meeting summary?
2011-04-14T11:47:54  <antimatroid> jeff, bocsi was
2011-04-14T11:47:56  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure if i'll like it. we'll see
2011-04-14T11:48:11  <jmcarthur> mightybyte too
2011-04-14T11:48:31  <Frontier> amstan: I've seen it. If you need some visualizer support for the damage option, I'm open for ideas.
2011-04-14T11:48:49  <Stocha> the current visualiser is not good ?
2011-04-14T11:48:58  <amstan> shouldn't the visualizer handle any kind of battle resolution?
2011-04-14T11:48:58  <jmcarthur> but yeah, i'm forced to declare my starter abandonware :(
2011-04-14T11:49:05  <antimatroid> the idea is to make it more obvious what the battle rules are watching a game
2011-04-14T11:49:07  <Frontier> it is good, but you don't see the damage on the enemy ants
2011-04-14T11:49:09  <amstan> jmcarthur: can we have a link for it?
2011-04-14T11:49:16  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how to do it though, without flashing up the amount of damage to each ant?
2011-04-14T11:49:19  <jmcarthur> i have terrible luck with IRL vs. ai challenges
2011-04-14T11:49:22  <antimatroid> perhaps that could be an option?
2011-04-14T11:49:57  <Frontier> i thought about filling the ant square with some pattern, bar, color whatever
2011-04-14T11:50:01  <Stocha> the visu will have to calculate the score independently of the server engine.
2011-04-14T11:50:11  <jmcarthur> amstan: sure. i'm not extremely happy with it. it's over-engineered right now, and i was going to tone it back down. also unless somebody else wants to pick it up i doubt the library format will work out as intended
2011-04-14T11:50:13  <jmcarthur> getting a link
2011-04-14T11:50:29  <amstan> jmcarthur: i don't care, i just want a link, i'll post it as an issue
2011-04-14T11:50:52  <Frontier> Stocha: or the replay file would need extra information about the damage dealt to each ant in each turn
2011-04-14T11:51:00  <Stocha> how would you flash the damage antimatroid ?
2011-04-14T11:51:09  <Stocha> like 0,4885843 up the ant's head ?
2011-04-14T11:51:20  <jmcarthur> amstan: http://darcsden.com/jmcarthur/ants-bot
2011-04-14T11:51:30  <Stocha> frontier: that will make it larger.
2011-04-14T11:51:31  <amstan> jmcarthur: cool, thanks
2011-04-14T11:51:37  <jmcarthur> i'm rather embarassed by it, but i'll swallow my pride
2011-04-14T11:51:40  <antimatroid> a floating point number with 1dp should suffice, rounding down
2011-04-14T11:51:45  <Stocha> Frontier: maybe reasonably larger though.
2011-04-14T11:52:00  <Stocha> 0,5 damage then ?
2011-04-14T11:52:10  <antimatroid> 0,5?
2011-04-14T11:52:14  <Stocha> or 0,4 i guess. not sure what rounding down means :p
2011-04-14T11:52:17  <antimatroid> oh, you use , for .?
2011-04-14T11:52:20  <Stocha> i use my previous example
2011-04-14T11:52:25  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@barracuda.imagesourceinc.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-14T11:52:25  <Stocha> ho yeah probably
2011-04-14T11:52:27  <Stocha> 0.5
2011-04-14T11:52:37  <Stocha> 0.4885843 then :p
2011-04-14T11:52:41  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-14T11:52:44  <Frontier> antimatroid, we use it, too
2011-04-14T11:52:47  <Stocha> so we say an ant dies if 10 damage
2011-04-14T11:52:49  <antimatroid> i would just represent that as 4.8
2011-04-14T11:52:54  <antimatroid> Frontier: you guys are wrong :P
2011-04-14T11:52:55  <Stocha> and then we go with one diggit
2011-04-14T11:52:58  <antimatroid> ./s
2011-04-14T11:53:12  <antimatroid> an ant dies with 1.0 damage or more
2011-04-14T11:53:15  <Frontier> 5*10^-1 then?
2011-04-14T11:53:17  <Stocha> that would mean 4.8 yeah
2011-04-14T11:53:44  <Stocha> with 10 damage, you got an easier way with representing damage :p
2011-04-14T11:53:44  *** superflit <superflit!~superflit@140.226.49.148> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-14T11:54:00  <Stocha> 0.48 the 0 is of no sure
2011-04-14T11:54:00  <jmcarthur> antimatroid:  c = a + b*(d^3) -- valid haskell even for home-grown matrices :)
2011-04-14T11:54:01  <Stocha> use
2011-04-14T11:54:06  <Stocha> we could go with 100 actually
2011-04-14T11:54:12  <Stocha> so that make it 48 damage.
2011-04-14T11:54:19  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: can i set operator precendece?
2011-04-14T11:54:22  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-04-14T11:54:30  <antimatroid> i really need to learn haskell moar
2011-04-14T11:54:30  <Stocha> anyway damage is not realated to score is it ?
2011-04-14T11:54:33  <Stocha> no it isn't.
2011-04-14T11:54:38  <jmcarthur> but those operators are already defined anyway. just overload them via type classes :)
2011-04-14T11:54:43  <jmcarthur> it's a principled overloading
2011-04-14T11:54:44  <Stocha> do we need to represent damage ?
2011-04-14T11:55:04  <antimatroid> Stocha: the idea was to make it visually easier to see what is happening i think
2011-04-14T11:55:12  <Stocha> representing score would be better. But trickyer.
2011-04-14T11:55:14  <antimatroid> it isn't strictly necessary, but may help people understand what's going on
2011-04-14T11:55:31  <antimatroid> not really, then flash up how many points each ant got
2011-04-14T11:55:38  <Stocha> then simply surround with an aura if ennemy is in range
2011-04-14T11:55:50  <Stocha> Ah you want people to be able to figure out the rule visually.
2011-04-14T11:55:58  <jmcarthur> infixr 8 ^   -- example of setting precedence in haskell
2011-04-14T11:56:04  <jmcarthur> for the ^ operator
2011-04-14T11:56:07  <Stocha> yeah then an optionnal damage number form 0 to 99
2011-04-14T11:56:25  <Stocha> and an aura for showing what ants are in ennemy range.
2011-04-14T11:56:45  <Stocha> But then you need some way of showing what is happening score wise.
2011-04-14T11:56:51  <amstan> antimatroid: make sure you use a vcs or something
2011-04-14T11:56:52  <Stocha> the problem being it is quite complex.
2011-04-14T11:56:53  <Stocha> mm
2011-04-14T11:57:03  <antimatroid> amstan: what for?
2011-04-14T11:57:06  <Stocha> unless you put positive score over ants that gain some
2011-04-14T11:57:13  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: ghc also accepts unicode input :)
2011-04-14T11:57:18  <Stocha> that would be another flashing number option.
2011-04-14T11:57:23  <amstan> antimatroid: for editing the haskell starter
2011-04-14T11:57:24  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: unicode is wrong :P
2011-04-14T11:57:27  <Stocha> are flashing number easy to do ?
2011-04-14T11:57:29  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-04-14T11:57:30  <Stocha> frontier: ?
2011-04-14T11:57:39  <antimatroid> amstan: you don't want me to play around with it, i know almost no haskell
2011-04-14T11:57:46  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-04-14T11:58:01  <antimatroid> it doesn't have enough maths symbols (for all, exists, relations etc.) or the greek alphabet
2011-04-14T11:58:03  <antimatroid> clearly it is wrong
2011-04-14T11:58:05  <Stocha> what map size does the current visu supports also ?
2011-04-14T11:58:07  <jmcarthur> i'm sorry for dumping it :(
2011-04-14T11:58:08  <antimatroid> element of relation
2011-04-14T11:58:22  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it does have forall, exists, etc...
2011-04-14T11:58:39  <antimatroid> o rly, now i need to get them on my keyboard
2011-04-14T11:58:47  <antimatroid> i don't understand why they aren't already on my keyboard :(
2011-04-14T11:58:50  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i use agda-mode's input method
2011-04-14T11:58:57  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: so i can just type \forall and \exists
2011-04-14T11:58:58  <Frontier> Stoach: i was afk
2011-04-14T11:59:28  <Stocha> is it easy to do flashing numbers frontier ?
2011-04-14T11:59:40  <Stocha> and a soret of aura for ants in ennemy radius ?
2011-04-14T12:00:02  <Stocha> we would need two optional flashy numbers. One for damage taken. And one for score earned by ants.
2011-04-14T12:00:09  * antimatroid looks up agda mode
2011-04-14T12:00:20  <Stocha> Then probably the protocol should be upgraded for the engine to send those values.
2011-04-14T12:00:21  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it will appear gibberish to you, but here is a valid agda module: http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/listings/lib-0.5/Relation.Binary.html#1
2011-04-14T12:00:42  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: by agda-mode i just mean the emacs mode for the agda language. i just ripped the input method so i could use it with haskell
2011-04-14T12:01:18  <Stocha> Maybe only show the flashy numbers when in zoom mode ?
2011-04-14T12:01:39  <antimatroid> oh god, haskell is wonderful
2011-04-14T12:01:41  <antimatroid> just so confusing
2011-04-14T12:01:53  <jmcarthur> agda != haskell, to be clear
2011-04-14T12:02:18  <antimatroid> yes, but c++ yells at me too much
2011-04-14T12:02:22  <antimatroid> and doesn't do enough
2011-04-14T12:02:28  <Frontier> Stocha: Well, it is easy to add anything to the animation sequence if you can live with it playing as fast as the replay.
2011-04-14T12:02:48  <jmcarthur> haskell isn't confusing once you have a month or two of solid experience under your belt
2011-04-14T12:02:50  <antimatroid> i had a problem the other day where i can't index matrix of bools as matrix[location] because you can't return a reference to an element in a vector of bools

2011-04-14T12:03:46  <jmcarthur> well in haskell everything is passed by value anyway, so such references are unnecessary :P
2011-04-14T12:04:08  <antimatroid> How you you access an element in a matrix?
2011-04-14T12:04:19  <jmcarthur> with a function
2011-04-14T12:04:36  <antimatroid> why not just use an operator?
2011-04-14T12:04:46  <antimatroid> it's the same isn't it? really
2011-04-14T12:04:47  <jmcarthur> (if you really want random access in the first place)
2011-04-14T12:04:55  <jmcarthur> yeah, it's the same
2011-04-14T12:05:04  <jmcarthur> operators are typically just binary functions with a different syntax
2011-04-14T12:05:15  <jmcarthur> you can even take a normal function and use it infix if you wrap it in backticks
2011-04-14T12:05:22  <antimatroid> yeah i know that
2011-04-14T12:05:24  <jmcarthur> 5 `mod` 3
2011-04-14T12:05:32  <antimatroid> can you define an operator to be infix by default?
2011-04-14T12:05:39  <antimatroid> i don't like having the put ` around it
2011-04-14T12:05:57  <jmcarthur> you mean a normal identifier?
2011-04-14T12:06:03  <jmcarthur> so you could say 5 mod 3?
2011-04-14T12:06:06  <jmcarthur> not in haskell
2011-04-14T12:06:08  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-14T12:06:08  <jmcarthur> you can in agda
2011-04-14T12:06:11  <Stocha> Fontier: there is a step by step feature in the replay has there not ?

2011-04-14T12:06:14  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan
2011-04-14T12:06:15  <Frontier> Stocha: Since the replay can theoretically be played backwards (and I would make that possible if it was requested) or at any speed, flashing numbers that should probably be displayed 1 second in any case don't fit in too well.
2011-04-14T12:06:23  <jmcarthur> in agda you can even define mixfix stuff, like if_then_else_
2011-04-14T12:06:24  <antimatroid> that's silly :\ why not let people define the type of operator it is?
2011-04-14T12:06:27  <Frontier> Stocha: there is, do you think the same as I do?
2011-04-14T12:06:39  <Stocha> fontier: my opinion is that it is enough that people "can" figure out score and damage. Not that it's very user friendly to do so :p
2011-04-14T12:06:49  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it's determined by whether its identifier is made up of symbols or alphanumerics
2011-04-14T12:07:18  <jmcarthur> you can make symbols prefix by wrapping in parens and alphanumerics infix by wrapping in backticks
2011-04-14T12:07:49  <antimatroid> you mean +(a, b)? isn't it + a b by default?
2011-04-14T12:07:53  <jmcarthur> no
2011-04-14T12:07:57  <antimatroid> where did i learn that?
2011-04-14T12:07:57  <jmcarthur> for +, infix is default
2011-04-14T12:07:59  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-04-14T12:08:04  <jmcarthur> (+) a b
2011-04-14T12:08:05  <Stocha> Frontier: personnaly i would go : number are optional, and only show on zoom mode for one turn (unless you think it can be meaningfull in normal mode)
2011-04-14T12:08:07  <jmcarthur> would be the other way
2011-04-14T12:08:10  <antimatroid> ah yeah
2011-04-14T12:08:11  <Frontier> so the damaged ant would flash up a damage number and the attackers would flash up a score number if they killed the ant
2011-04-14T12:08:31  <Stocha> Fontier: yeah.
2011-04-14T12:08:44  <Stocha> Fontier: but i'm notoriously bad at making good looking stuff :p
2011-04-14T12:09:01  <Frontier> Stocha: I already have that mode where it draws letters over ants. I have to see how it mixes.
2011-04-14T12:09:14  <Stocha> Frontier: i think the numbers would be only marginally usefull. But the "ennemy is in range" aura i would like to have.
2011-04-14T12:09:21  <Stocha> oh
2011-04-14T12:10:03  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i am hopefully going to be doing gsoc, so i may not have much time either, haskell may need to wait till summer
2011-04-14T12:10:11  <Frontier> I think with 8 players even people with normal color sight may have problems to distinguish certain colors.
2011-04-14T12:10:21  <Stocha> Fontier: damage and score is not exclusive
2011-04-14T12:10:24  <antimatroid> i think 4 players would be fine
2011-04-14T12:10:50  <Frontier> Stocha: hmm, that would be up to 3 text lines on a single ant :p
2011-04-14T12:10:58  <Stocha> If we could rule out the max number of players that would be good for visualizer stuff i think.
2011-04-14T12:11:25  <Stocha> Fontier: what about making the 3 options exclusives ? or letter view /numbers exclusives ?
2011-04-14T12:11:32  <Stocha> or damage/score exclusive ?
2011-04-14T12:11:55  <Frontier> Stocha: I'm not sure. I implemented everything quite flexible now. Player numbers aren't a problem except for the obvious color confusion.
2011-04-14T12:12:05  <Stocha> okay
2011-04-14T12:12:20  <Stocha> have you try a 256x256 game with 1000 turn and 8 players ?
2011-04-14T12:12:31  <Stocha> i think it would be hard on the visualizer
2011-04-14T12:12:49  <Frontier> Stocha: That sounds good. Maybe I should implement buttons that open menus, like the 'caption' menu, or the 'display mode' menu
2011-04-14T12:12:49  <Stocha> like you need 2gb to use it, and wait 5 minutes for it loading :p
2011-04-14T12:13:12  <Frontier> Stocha: I didn't like the loading times and removed them
2011-04-14T12:13:13  <Stocha> I think the idea is that numbers score and damage would only be used for "debugging"
2011-04-14T12:13:48  <Stocha> Fontier : let's stress test your visu a bit and see what it can handle easilly / acceptably then ?
2011-04-14T12:14:18  <Stocha> I think 256x256 maps, with increasing number of hunter bots and 1000 turn long is good for that.
2011-04-14T12:16:43  <Frontier> What I don't like about 1000 turns and large maps is that the games become a big bunch of colored pixels flashing up. You have a hard time to follow individual ants or see animations. Planetwars was better there since you could start your 1000 ships from a small number of planets only.
2011-04-14T12:16:45  <antimatroid> Frontier: what's the deal with games going really fast if they're more than 200 turns long?
2011-04-14T12:16:57  <antimatroid> it's almost impossible to watch the games on "play" and see what is happening :P
2011-04-14T12:17:13  <Frontier> antimatroid: Someone once said that games should take no more than one minute to watch.
2011-04-14T12:17:26  <antimatroid> is it possible to provide a scroll bar people can use to adjust how fast it goes?
2011-04-14T12:17:32  <antimatroid> i think pw had something like that in the end
2011-04-14T12:17:42  <Frontier> a scrollbar? really?
2011-04-14T12:17:46  <amstan> antimatroid: if you want it slower, you can drag the mouse
2011-04-14T12:17:48  <antimatroid> whatever, slider
2011-04-14T12:17:49  <Frontier> I remember + and -
2011-04-14T12:18:01  <antimatroid> + and - is fine too
2011-04-14T12:18:01  <amstan> everyone wants features on the visualizer, it's hilarious
2011-04-14T12:18:13  <amstan> we don't want to have it look like the space shuttle
2011-04-14T12:18:16  <Frontier> amstan: It's inspiring ^^
2011-04-14T12:18:19  <antimatroid> we've gotta keep Frontier on his toes :P
2011-04-14T12:18:24  <amstan> i guess
2011-04-14T12:19:09  <Stocha> frontier: like you skip frames
2011-04-14T12:19:21  <Stocha> fontier: you still have to skip them fast enough though
2011-04-14T12:20:13  <Stocha> We want a very easy simple view for going through games. And then more precise if we need to understand what's going on. Like the zoom
2011-04-14T12:20:22  <Frontier> Stocha: I don't have frames in a fixed rate. I interpolate between the two frames that are around a time x. Frame 1 may be at x - 10 seconds, and frame 2 at x + 2.1 seconds
2011-04-14T12:20:23  <Stocha> although the 10x10 zoom is a bit brutal :p
2011-04-14T12:20:41  <Stocha> uh
2011-04-14T12:20:44  <amstan> janzert: when are you available? i'll need some help getting to know your install scripts
2011-04-14T12:20:55  <Frontier> The zoom is 20x20 btw ;)
2011-04-14T12:20:56  <amstan> janzert: are you ok this weekend?
2011-04-14T12:21:07  <Stocha> ah. that's even more brutal then.
2011-04-14T12:21:22  <Frontier> That is because 10x10 is already the maximum zoom in unzoomed mode
2011-04-14T12:21:39  <Stocha> would it be possible to have like a mouse wheel that zoom (x+1)(x+1) at a time ?
2011-04-14T12:21:54  <Stocha> uh ?
2011-04-14T12:22:06  <Stocha> i'm not sure i used last version or anything.
2011-04-14T12:22:21  <Frontier> Oo ... well if browsers don't catch some combination of Shift+Alt+Strg+Mouse-Wheel that would work.
2011-04-14T12:22:26  <amstan> contestbot: later tell i'm looking at getting buildbot going, i'll need some help to get to know your setup scripts, when are you available to irc? is this weekend ok?
2011-04-14T12:22:26  <contestbot> amstan: Error: That is an invalid IRC nick. Please check your input.
2011-04-14T12:22:38  <Stocha> Well after this round of "feature" the visualiser should be finish. Because rules won't evolved a lot now.
2011-04-14T12:22:39  <Frontier> hehe
2011-04-14T12:22:44  <amstan> contestbot: later tell janzert i'm looking at getting buildbot going, i'll need some help to get to know your setup scripts, when are you available to irc? is this weekend ok?
2011-04-14T12:22:44  <contestbot> amstan: Ready to serve, my lord.
2011-04-14T12:23:03  <Stocha> Fontier: make the wheel optional if possible.
2011-04-14T12:23:04  * amstan always wondered if contestbot would send tells to random nicks that don't exist
2011-04-14T12:23:15  <Stocha> what is strg ?
2011-04-14T12:23:23  <Frontier> ctrl, sorry
2011-04-14T12:23:49  <Stocha> ah. simple mouse wheel is already taken i suppose :p
2011-04-14T12:23:51  <Frontier> ConTRtroL=STeueRunG
2011-04-14T12:24:06  <Frontier> maybe... to srcoll the page? :p
2011-04-14T12:24:06  <Stocha> then don't use mouse wheel. use control + arrow ?
2011-04-14T12:24:23  <Stocha> or anything that suit the zooming
2011-04-14T12:24:36  <Stocha> i don't know how it's done usually
2011-04-14T12:24:47  <antimatroid> scrolling elements of pages isn't that uncommon
2011-04-14T12:24:51  <Stocha> surely there is a common pattern for zooming in there
2011-04-14T12:25:07  <Stocha> and scrolling yes.
2011-04-14T12:25:15  <antimatroid> it's also a good way of allowing people to stumble across the feature :p
2011-04-14T12:25:47  <Stocha> ah you have a deutchen ctrl then :p
2011-04-14T12:26:07  <Frontier> ctrl+left jumps multiple pages back in history and ctrl+up selects the next hyperlink
2011-04-14T12:26:20  <Stocha> Can not javascript or whatever u used override key stroke mouse wheel strokes ?
2011-04-14T12:26:55  <Frontier> Stocha: unfortunately not. usually they are both executed
2011-04-14T12:27:05  <Stocha> Use two buttons i guess.
2011-04-14T12:27:34  <Stocha> or split in two the one you already have.

2011-04-14T12:28:46  <Frontier> I'll add another magnifying glass and put a + and - in the center
2011-04-14T12:30:39  <Frontier> and then zoom 2x from the current size (which will be 10 at max on a large screen or small map) up to 20x20.
2011-04-14T12:31:26  <Frontier> But first I think I should make the zoomed mode a bit faster by only drawing what is visible.

2011-04-14T12:34:53  <Stocha> what will be the maximum minimum density for initial food ?
2011-04-14T12:35:22  <Frontier> antimatroid: ^
2011-04-14T12:35:47  <Stocha> i had an old version :p
2011-04-14T12:36:13  <Stocha> i tested in safari max os x.
2011-04-14T12:36:15  <Stocha> seems to work now.

2011-04-14T12:37:26  <Frontier> Stocha has a question about the initial food that I cannot answer
2011-04-14T12:37:40  <Stocha> yeah that was for mcleopold i guess :)
2011-04-14T12:37:44  <antimatroid> Stocha: we've already answered this, we don't know
2011-04-14T12:37:51  <McLeopold> what's up?
2011-04-14T12:37:53  <antimatroid> for the moment you can assume all land squares as an upper bound
2011-04-14T12:38:00  <Stocha> so initial food is 0% map and up to 100% map.
2011-04-14T12:38:09  <Frontier> no water squares for confusion? :(
2011-04-14T12:38:11  <antimatroid> in reality i suspect we will start with almost no food present
2011-04-14T12:38:17  <Stocha> 100% map might be overdoing it a bit though
2011-04-14T12:38:28  <Stocha> i mean 100% ground map :p
2011-04-14T12:38:41  <Stocha> that makes quite a lot of ants to care for :p
2011-04-14T12:38:41  <Frontier> chain reactions are cool to watch
2011-04-14T12:38:43  <antimatroid> in the games i have run, the maps are flooded if you start with too much food and have spawning
2011-04-14T12:38:49  <antimatroid> and flooded maps are boring
2011-04-14T12:39:05  <Stocha> i used up to 90% in my testings.
2011-04-14T12:39:28  <Stocha> it's a setting among others. it should be decided up front, and offers varity.
2011-04-14T12:39:29  <antimatroid> Frontier: did i give you replay files where i literally started with like 50% food?

2011-04-14T12:39:37  <Stocha> like say 80% of initial ground is a maximum.
2011-04-14T12:39:47  <Stocha> then people can tune their engine to be sure not to go out of time.
2011-04-14T12:39:48  <McLeopold> much lower than that
2011-04-14T12:39:58  <antimatroid> i think we could almost start with 0 food
2011-04-14T12:40:01  <antimatroid> if we're doing spawning
2011-04-14T12:40:15  <Stocha> 0 start is certainly an intersting setting. But not very diverse.
2011-04-14T12:40:32  <antimatroid> it has the problem of people coming across each other near the start and just offing each other
2011-04-14T12:40:37  <Stocha> you could go for 0 - 1000 up to 80% map size.
2011-04-14T12:40:40  <Frontier> antimatroid: Yes I watched a game where the map was flooded pretty much
2011-04-14T12:40:52  <antimatroid> i still think it should be quite small, and I think we might need to decrease the spawn rate too
2011-04-14T12:41:14  <Stocha> what's is spawning ? ah you mean spawning food.
2011-04-14T12:41:19  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-14T12:41:44  <Stocha> the there is the question of how food spawn. :p
2011-04-14T12:42:01  <Stocha> I think you would go for 1 food/player per turn as the basis. but maybe variety can be added.
2011-04-14T12:42:06  <McLeopold> I'd say 5% ground coverage should be the max starting food
2011-04-14T12:42:20  <McLeopold> 1% seems to work quite well
2011-04-14T12:42:24  <Stocha> 0-5% ground ? with a upper cap ?
2011-04-14T12:42:34  <Stocha> i think variety is good :p
2011-04-14T12:42:39  <antimatroid> Stocha: that's the current rate for spawning, i'm worried it's too high though
2011-04-14T12:42:41  <McLeopold> 4% gets a little crowded with dumb bots
2011-04-14T12:42:44  <Stocha> 5% doesn't sound like that much
2011-04-14T12:42:52  <antimatroid> Stocha: you would be surprised
2011-04-14T12:43:00  <antimatroid> i am fine with capping it at 5 for the moment
2011-04-14T12:43:15  <Stocha> Real games will be far faster than random bots /hunter bots :)
2011-04-14T12:43:24  <McLeopold> antimatroid: are you happy with the battle resolution now? :)
2011-04-14T12:43:25  <antimatroid> not necessarily
2011-04-14T12:43:33  <antimatroid> McLeopold: couldn't be happier :)
2011-04-14T12:43:34  <Stocha> okay i'm fine with 5% max too, let's see how it goes for a 256x256 full ground map
2011-04-14T12:44:04  <Stocha> that's 3200 food at start.
2011-04-14T12:44:05  <antimatroid> it's also the weekend for me
2011-04-14T12:44:07  <antimatroid> :D
2011-04-14T12:44:19  <antimatroid> Stocha: see, even that's pretty much too much
2011-04-14T12:44:30  <Stocha> then let's 5% capped at 1000 ?
2011-04-14T12:44:39  <Stocha> 0-5% capped at 1000 ?
2011-04-14T12:44:45  <antimatroid> nah, leave it at 5%
2011-04-14T12:44:56  <antimatroid> the idea is to have a wide net to start with that can be restricted
2011-04-14T12:44:58  <Stocha> maybe there won't be 256x256 full ground maps also :p
2011-04-14T12:45:11  <antimatroid> it's better to restrict the rules when improving rather than changing them
2011-04-14T12:45:24  <Stocha> About the spawning, will you allow assymetrical spawn ?
2011-04-14T12:45:33  <antimatroid> yes, you can do symmetric spawning already
2011-04-14T12:45:47  <antimatroid> i don't want anything to do with asymmetric maps or spawning, it's too random, impossible to test with etc.
2011-04-14T12:45:50  <Stocha> i know that. i wonder about assymetrical
2011-04-14T12:45:55  <Stocha> okay.
2011-04-14T12:46:09  <Stocha> so you'll have to decide spawn / turn ratio then.

2011-04-14T12:46:16  <Stocha> it could have some randomness built in also.
2011-04-14T12:46:32  <antimatroid> what do you mean by randomness?
2011-04-14T12:46:36  <Stocha> let's say some game have 10% to 30% chance of each turn being a spawn turn.
2011-04-14T12:46:42  <Frontier> Do you all agree that large maps are good? Because I think it will look confusing and prefer 80x60.
2011-04-14T12:46:53  <Stocha> so a 10% game, will have 10% for each turn to be spawning food symetrically
2011-04-14T12:46:54  <antimatroid> Frontier: what's a large map?
2011-04-14T12:47:10  <Stocha> 256x256 is large.
2011-04-14T12:47:11  <Frontier> 100x100 and larger
2011-04-14T12:47:23  <antimatroid> i don't want much smaller than 80x80
2011-04-14T12:47:24  <Stocha>  i think we need large games, if only to see that they add nothing.
2011-04-14T12:47:31  <antimatroid> and we've capped at 256x256 for the moment
2011-04-14T12:47:33  <Stocha> we need very small maps too.
2011-04-14T12:47:47  <Stocha> 256x256 seems reasonable max in my testing.
2011-04-14T12:47:54  <Stocha> bigger won't add anything
2011-04-14T12:47:59  <Frontier> yeah, let's test every size and then see what is most interesting.
2011-04-14T12:48:01  <Stocha> unless you go for very huge number of player.
2011-04-14T12:48:16  <Stocha> I think map diversity if very important.
2011-04-14T12:48:16  <antimatroid> that will be best done with a beta server/tcp
2011-04-14T12:48:22  <Stocha> but at some point it might not do much
2011-04-14T12:48:24  <antimatroid> put on a bunch of maps and play a bunch of games and ask what people think
2011-04-14T12:48:33  <Stocha> for example maybe 128x128 and 256x256 are the same.
2011-04-14T12:48:47  <Stocha> in my 1vs1 testing i had that feeling kinda.
2011-04-14T12:48:52  <antimatroid> if we want to hide the number of players, we need to use 120x240/120 i think
2011-04-14T12:48:59  <Stocha> although food density with fixed rate is lower in bigger maps. and such.
2011-04-14T12:49:00  * Frontier wonders why noone asked for coordinate hints on mouse-over in the visualizer
2011-04-14T12:49:08  <antimatroid> actually, not if we use like 4/6
2011-04-14T12:49:17  <Stocha> whats 120x240/120 ?
2011-04-14T12:49:28  <Frontier> either x240 or x120
2011-04-14T12:49:31  <antimatroid> lcm(2,3,4,5,6,8)
2011-04-14T12:49:40  <Stocha> uh ?
2011-04-14T12:49:53  <Stocha> is that symetricall stuff vocabulary ?
2011-04-14T12:49:56  <antimatroid> the number of rows for example is divisible by the number of players
2011-04-14T12:50:07  <Stocha> why not add some buffer zones ?
2011-04-14T12:50:16  <antimatroid> so if the dimensions aren't divisible by every possible number of players, people get information about how many players there might be
2011-04-14T12:50:21  <Stocha> maybe that's not possible i don't know :p
2011-04-14T12:50:23  <Frontier> antimatroid: If you scew the squares you can have the total number of squares equal the lcm.
2011-04-14T12:51:01  <Stocha> what does scew means ?
2011-04-14T12:51:11  <Frontier> oh my spelling
2011-04-14T12:51:15  <Stocha> does it means starting is not square shaped ?
2011-04-14T12:51:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: how is your symmetric map gen going?
2011-04-14T12:51:45  <antimatroid> i like both types of maps
2011-04-14T12:51:58  <Stocha> There is already a java symmetric map generator version. i saw it.
2011-04-14T12:52:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: my bot can expand like 4-5 times faster than hunter bot too :)
2011-04-14T12:52:21  <Frontier> shearing I mean
2011-04-14T12:52:45  <Stocha> i think there should be some variety in map generator codes. Maybe like base random walker be the default, and then 10% probability of triggering special generators. Like the labyrinth style.
2011-04-14T12:52:51  <Stocha> or lower than 10% in some cases maybe.
2011-04-14T12:53:05  <Frontier> Can we do this: http://ants.zeroviz.us/Kl0Kh/ on a much smaller map as well?
2011-04-14T12:53:32  *** berak <berak!~chatzilla@82.113.121.55> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection timed out)
2011-04-14T12:53:37  <antimatroid> do what?
2011-04-14T12:53:48  <Stocha> how many player is there on this map frontier ?
2011-04-14T12:54:07  <Frontier> 10
2011-04-14T12:54:10  <Stocha> What are the constraints for map size and symmetricals.
2011-04-14T12:54:25  <Stocha> you can have maybe more symetrical home than you have players also
2011-04-14T12:54:29  <Stocha> to blurr the data.
2011-04-14T12:54:31  <Frontier> but the map size is 100x120, so this is no proof
2011-04-14T12:54:36  *** berak <berak!~chatzilla@82.113.121.55> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-14T12:54:37  <amstan> is this actually symmetric? http://ants.zeroviz.us/Kl0Kh/
2011-04-14T12:54:43  <Stocha> it won't be worth than the randomness for assymetrical bots strength.
2011-04-14T12:54:49  <amstan> there's 7 ppl
2011-04-14T12:54:55  <Frontier> amstan: It irritated me too
2011-04-14T12:55:05  <Stocha> amstan: it is yes
2011-04-14T12:55:09  <Frontier> I though: HOW the fuck is this possible?!?!?
2011-04-14T12:55:14  <antimatroid> amstan: yes it is :)
2011-04-14T12:55:31  <antimatroid> Frontier: group theory got me the answer
2011-04-14T12:55:31  <Stocha> how is what possible ?
2011-04-14T12:55:31  <amstan> i'll take your word for it, lol
2011-04-14T12:55:46  <Stocha> it looks like it is i mean.
2011-04-14T12:55:49  <antimatroid> the order of an element of the cartesian product of two groups is the lcm of hte orders of each element
2011-04-14T12:56:24  <Frontier> and now for non-math students
2011-04-14T12:56:24  <Stocha> uh ?
2011-04-14T12:56:28  <antimatroid> and of course is itself a group
2011-04-14T12:56:35  <amstan> Frontier: +1
2011-04-14T12:56:57  <Stocha> don't you mathematician have easy to pronounce word for easy to understand stuff ?
2011-04-14T12:57:00  <antimatroid> hmm okay
2011-04-14T12:57:28  <Stocha> like levenstein distance = edit distance
2011-04-14T12:57:46  <antimatroid> if you have rows and row_translate, the number of translates it takes to get back into the same square from repeated translations is rows/gcd(rows, row_translate)
2011-04-14T12:57:54  <Stocha> you don't have to remember all the name of the contributing mathematicians do you
2011-04-14T12:58:07  <antimatroid> does that make sense?
2011-04-14T12:58:18  <Stocha> where gcd would be greater common divisor
2011-04-14T12:58:21  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-14T12:58:23  <Frontier> yes it does, because I thought about that earlier
2011-04-14T12:58:39  <Stocha> but can't you add somme buffer zones ?
2011-04-14T12:58:48  <Stocha> without breaking the symmetry too much.
2011-04-14T12:58:53  <antimatroid> then, the idea is to have row_translate and col_translate so that if you take a location, n repeated translations will get you back to the exact same square
2011-04-14T12:58:59  <Stocha> like say you have your symetric map. You add a row.
2011-04-14T12:59:00  <antimatroid> symmetry is not to be broken
2011-04-14T12:59:26  <antimatroid> where n is the number of players
2011-04-14T12:59:53  <antimatroid> i also make sure no two players start in the same row or column, as it's visually more appealing and makes food spawning easier
2011-04-14T12:59:58  <Stocha> so i you build a 8 player symmetrical stuff, and only put 4 on it. it won't be symmetrical anymore ?
2011-04-14T13:00:04  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-dtegffcnbuiscllc> has quit IRC (Quit: bhasker)
2011-04-14T13:00:13  <antimatroid> but that's just a matter of making sure the order of row translations is the same as for col translations
2011-04-14T13:00:27  <antimatroid> Stocha: depending on which players you remove, no
2011-04-14T13:00:54  <Stocha> There is no solution from N payer symetrical down to p player symmetrical ever ?
2011-04-14T13:01:06  <antimatroid> why would you need to?
2011-04-14T13:01:08  <Stocha> without changing the map only the number of spawned players
2011-04-14T13:01:17  <Stocha> to hide the number of players.
2011-04-14T13:01:27  <Stocha> or at least blurr it.
2011-04-14T13:01:30  <antimatroid> you wouldn't always be able to restrict it to less players
2011-04-14T13:01:52  <antimatroid> if number of new players divides the old number you might
2011-04-14T13:01:58  <antimatroid> but i'm not promising that
2011-04-14T13:02:02  <Stocha> symetricall is to much bother :p
2011-04-14T13:02:07  <antimatroid> no it's not
2011-04-14T13:02:14  <Stocha> what about a mix of symetrical and asymetrical then ?
2011-04-14T13:02:20  <Frontier> antimatroid: would the row and the col each have to be lmc(2,3,4,5,6,8) on such maps?
2011-04-14T13:02:21  <antimatroid> that's the plan
2011-04-14T13:02:21  <Stocha> like 80 symmetric, and 20% assymetric ?
2011-04-14T13:02:28  <Stocha> ah
2011-04-14T13:02:30  <antimatroid> but everyone that has used asymmetric so far has said the results are too random
2011-04-14T13:02:40  <Stocha> the result are random.
2011-04-14T13:02:40  <antimatroid> Frontier: yes
2011-04-14T13:02:47  <Stocha> but i wonder about "too random"
2011-04-14T13:02:52  <antimatroid> but if we used say just 4/6 players, your lcm is much lower
2011-04-14T13:03:17  <Stocha> i certainly was able to assert the relative strength of my bot 1vs1 on assymetrical map.
2011-04-14T13:03:27  <Stocha> with quite some precision i would add.
2011-04-14T13:03:37  <antimatroid> Stocha: it's harder when there are a few thousand quite different bots
2011-04-14T13:04:05  <Stocha> The pairing usually goes be some clever pairing schemes
2011-04-14T13:04:27  <Stocha> as long as it 1vs1 i'm confident about the rankings; For 100 000 games and more.
2011-04-14T13:04:32  <Stocha> even with 5000 players.
2011-04-14T13:04:42  <Stocha> and clever pairing.

2011-04-14T13:05:34  <antimatroid> the current scoring method doesn't work for 1v1 when the game doesn't end before max turns
2011-04-14T13:05:35  <Stocha> i have a litle time, i should work on my litle v2 bot i suppose. see you.
2011-04-14T13:06:10  <Stocha> 1vs1 match should be mixed in though. like at least 10% of the games.
2011-04-14T13:06:22  <Stocha> if only to blur the number of player.
2011-04-14T13:06:44  <Stocha> well the scoring does work for 1vs1. It's only dum.
2011-04-14T13:06:56  <Stocha> but you can make bot to try to maximize their scores.

2011-04-14T20:37:51  <Frontier> crazy, tonight a table quiz question was, what is the capital of Tasmania, and I didn't know.
2011-04-14T20:38:40  <Frontier> although we have at least one Tassies here on IRC with whom I talk regularly.

2011-04-14T22:53:04  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: please don't tell me function names can't be overloaded in haskell?
2011-04-14T22:53:21  <antimatroid> but don't lie to me either :P
2011-04-14T23:00:35  <antimatroid> actually, i guess that wouldn't work with functions all taking one parameter?
2011-04-14T23:00:37  <antimatroid> hmmm bugger okay
2011-04-14T23:09:53  <amstan> antimatroid: they can't in python
2011-04-14T23:10:00  <amstan> also... i'm pretty sure they can in haskell
2011-04-14T23:10:07  <antimatroid> amstan: i hate python :P
2011-04-14T23:10:11  <amstan> isn't that one of the cool thinkings in haskell?
2011-04-14T23:10:14  <antimatroid> well, dislike, i hate java
2011-04-14T23:10:16  <amstan> you can do stuff like fib 1 = 1?
2011-04-14T23:10:40  <antimatroid> that's pattern matching isn't it?
2011-04-14T23:10:45  <amstan> i'm not sure
2011-04-14T23:46:11  <sigh> amstan: yes, you can
2011-04-14T23:46:40  <amstan> yay, i know something about haskell!
2011-04-14T23:46:51  <sigh> heh
2011-04-14T23:50:34  <amstan> so... apparently minecraft can take 1.8GB huge screenshots
2011-04-14T23:50:39  <amstan> TGA files
2011-04-14T23:50:46  <amstan> any idea what to open them with without crashing
2011-04-14T23:50:50  <amstan> i have 4GB of ram
2011-04-14T23:55:54  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: overloading is facilitated by type classes
2011-04-14T23:57:45  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: but even so, it doesn't work by number of arguments. it works by type.
2011-04-14T23:58:12  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: (and interestingly, not only the types of the arguments, but also the type of the result)
2011-04-14T23:59:24  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: that was my point, you can't overload with a different lot of parameters?
2011-04-14T23:59:31  <jmcarthur> also, it's intended to be a principled kind of overloading. you shouldn't be using it just because you want two functions to have the same name. you should be using it because there is something general that you want to capture over many types
2011-04-14T23:59:46  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: there are type system tricks to do it, but they are ugly and fragile
