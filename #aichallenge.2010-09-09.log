2010-09-09T01:22:51  <amstan> sorry for the spam, it's over
2010-09-09T01:23:03  <a1k0n> what i don't like about option #3 is: where do the losing ships "go"?
2010-09-09T01:23:21  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: assuming (R,B) and N for the participants...    method 1 gives 4N, method 2 gives 3R, method 3 gives 1N
2010-09-09T01:23:34  <a1k0n> in all other circumstances it takes 1 ship to kill 1 ship
2010-09-09T01:24:11  <antimatroid1> yeah, i think it's between 1 and 2
2010-09-09T01:24:18  <jmcarthur> i personally think #3 is the simplest to resolve
2010-09-09T01:24:25  <a1k0n> yeah but it doesn't make any sense
2010-09-09T01:24:34  <antimatroid1> my pseudo for 2 needs to be changed when fixing up number of ships to a new owner after it was neutral
2010-09-09T01:24:54  <antimatroid1> i don't think it's that expensive too, just a little tedious
2010-09-09T01:25:09  <jmcarthur> the intuition about #3 is that each RBN triplet is equally matched and therefore they cancel each other out
2010-09-09T01:25:24  <a1k0n> 1000R ships attack, 500G ships attack, 499N are present.  winner is R with 500 ships, as if the 499N weren't there at all
2010-09-09T01:25:35  <a1k0n> i guess that's true
2010-09-09T01:25:54  <a1k0n> but if it's a triplet then red shuld have like 500.33333 ships
2010-09-09T01:26:02  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  that is odd.. it feels like the 499 should count too
2010-09-09T01:26:04  <jmcarthur> hmm?
2010-09-09T01:26:14  <jmcarthur> why 500.33333?
2010-09-09T01:26:45  <a1k0n> because there isn't a full triplet for the last ship
2010-09-09T01:26:53  <a1k0n> or whatever
2010-09-09T01:27:11  <jmcarthur> right, there's a pair for the last ship
2010-09-09T01:27:14  <jmcarthur> also equally matched
2010-09-09T01:27:19  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.81.198> has quit IRC
2010-09-09T01:27:35  <antimatroid1> i think it should be each players ships split in half and play each other players ships
2010-09-09T01:27:47  <jmcarthur> i think that might be equivalent
2010-09-09T01:27:51  <antimatroid1> (sorry, I'm thinking about that and it seems right atm)
2010-09-09T01:27:51  <AlliedEnvy> Or maybe weighted split
2010-09-09T01:29:25  <a1k0n> all right, well, in that case jkl's patch is right
2010-09-09T01:30:01  <antimatroid1> problem still comes with (20, 10) arriving at 20
2010-09-09T01:30:12  <jmcarthur> i don't (personally) see that as a problem case
2010-09-09T01:30:20  <antimatroid1> neutral maintains ownership of 0 bots and players 1 and 2 lose their ships
2010-09-09T01:31:01  <antimatroid1> i don't see any way around it
2010-09-09T01:31:09  <a1k0n> yeah, that's what it would do
2010-09-09T01:31:09  <antimatroid1> i just considered it undesirable intuitively
2010-09-09T01:31:35  <antimatroid1> anyway, i need to go back to uni and finish this computer graphics assignment i've been neglecting (it's due tomorrow)
2010-09-09T01:31:46  <a1k0n> but with that rule, it's strategically a waste to have your ships arrive at the same time anywhere as your opponent
2010-09-09T01:31:53  <jmcarthur> there is another unbiased option, but it involved randomness
2010-09-09T01:31:53  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.81.198> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-09T01:31:57  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-09T01:31:58  <a1k0n> you lose ships with no gain
2010-09-09T01:32:05  * AlliedEnvy tries to imagine how weighted split would play it out - 10 sends 5 to each 20, each 20 sends 40/3 to the other 20 and 20/3 to the 10
2010-09-09T01:32:13  <jmcarthur> i think no matter what that is the case though
2010-09-09T01:32:18  <a1k0n> if you fight each other before neutral, or after neutral, then you are at least doing damage to your opponent even if you lose
2010-09-09T01:32:33  <jmcarthur> but remember that they lose as much as you do
2010-09-09T01:32:42  <a1k0n> of course
2010-09-09T01:32:43  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: it is anyway,  the 1000/500/499 version, it's still better to arrive the next turn rather than the same time.
2010-09-09T01:32:49  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: yes
2010-09-09T01:32:57  <a1k0n> but in the 3-way case, you lose your ships and they would have lost theirs anyway
2010-09-09T01:33:07  <jmcarthur> i would consider that a potential tactic, not a flaw
2010-09-09T01:33:27  <jmcarthur> to know when to wait and when not to
2010-09-09T01:33:28  <a1k0n> it's frustratingly subtle IMO
2010-09-09T01:33:44  <jmcarthur> none of the proposed methods would change that
2010-09-09T01:33:49  <a1k0n> it means you have to really understand that implementation detail slash game rule to implement a competitive bot
2010-09-09T01:33:51  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: my favourite, in a sick and twisted way
2010-09-09T01:34:13  <jmcarthur> in all three cases, it's better to wait an extra turn
2010-09-09T01:34:31  <a1k0n> with options 1 or 2, if you send X ships at a planet, you are killing X additional ships of your opponents', period.  with option 3, you may be killing 0 additional
2010-09-09T01:34:38  <antimatroid1> depends on growth rate cough cough
2010-09-09T01:34:55  <jmcarthur> with all three options, you guarantee to kill maximally if you just wait an extra turn before attacking
2010-09-09T01:34:55  <antimatroid1> and other factors
2010-09-09T01:35:02  <jmcarthur> okay, aside from growth rate
2010-09-09T01:35:06  <jmcarthur> and outside forces
2010-09-09T01:35:09  <jmcarthur> sure
2010-09-09T01:35:11  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-09-09T01:35:15  <a1k0n> well if you let them take the planet then yeah you have the growth rate to contend with
2010-09-09T01:35:27  <a1k0n> so you kill X-G of their ships if you wait
2010-09-09T01:35:28  <antimatroid1> depends on a few things a1k0n
2010-09-09T01:35:44  <amstan> can someone help me test the bot?
2010-09-09T01:35:51  <jmcarthur> !rankings
2010-09-09T01:35:52  <contestbot> jmcarthur: Error: "rankings" is not a valid command.
2010-09-09T01:35:53  <antimatroid1> sorry, i really have to leave soon
2010-09-09T01:36:01  <amstan> report in #hypertriangle if you're open to it
2010-09-09T01:36:03  <Zaphus> where is philhassey - he could tell us how galcon handles it
2010-09-09T01:36:18  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: galcon works a little differently in the first place i think
2010-09-09T01:36:26  <antimatroid1> it still needs to handle it i think
2010-09-09T01:36:32  <amstan> contestbot: tell later jmcarthur test
2010-09-09T01:36:51  <jmcarthur> i suspect that official galcon simply picks some arbitrary order for each individual ship to attack
2010-09-09T01:36:55  <amstan> did that work?
2010-09-09T01:37:00  <a1k0n> galcon attacks one ship at a time, probably attacking neutral before each other
2010-09-09T01:37:02  <jmcarthur> nope
2010-09-09T01:37:08  <antimatroid1> i would suggest picking first/last sent fleet for fighting first/second
2010-09-09T01:37:15  <antimatroid1> but then they may have been sent simultaneously as well
2010-09-09T01:37:19  <amstan> contestbot: later tell jmcarthur test
2010-09-09T01:37:19  <contestbot> amstan: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-09T01:37:23  <a1k0n> antimatroid1: they still could ahve been sent simultaneously
2010-09-09T01:37:28  <jmcarthur> yo contestbot !
2010-09-09T01:37:37  <jmcarthur> that worked
2010-09-09T01:37:40  <amstan> cool!
2010-09-09T01:38:17  <jmcarthur> amstan: btw, it may be a good idea to prefix contestbot's outputs with a space or two to help prevent bot loops
2010-09-09T01:38:30  <Zaphus> or...   how about:   Both arriving fleets fight the neutrals first, so 499/2 each  (toss a coin for the half)  then they fight each other   so the 1000/500/499 would resolve to  749/250/0   then to 499/0/0
2010-09-09T01:38:47  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: that would be method 2
2010-09-09T01:38:48  <amstan> jmcarthur: i don't think that's an option, if you can find something like that please tell me: http://supybook.fealdia.org/devel/
2010-09-09T01:39:03  <jmcarthur> oh it's an existing bot
2010-09-09T01:39:04  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  Ok, then I like method 2  :-)
2010-09-09T01:39:17  <a1k0n> since the fleets are all attacking the *planet* option 2 probably makes the most sense
2010-09-09T01:39:45  <jmcarthur> well, they are moving *to* the planet. they wouldn't attack anything if nothing was there anyway
2010-09-09T01:39:59  <jmcarthur> this kind of is a question of what a move fundamentally is
2010-09-09T01:40:02  <Zaphus> it's about the equivalent of each individual fighter hitting the planet one at a time from each side
2010-09-09T01:40:19  <jmcarthur> why one at a time? why not simultaneously?
2010-09-09T01:40:36  <jmcarthur> the turns make the ships move all at once
2010-09-09T01:40:50  <Zaphus> the tough case is:    500/500/499   - who gets the left over ship, R or G ?
2010-09-09T01:40:57  <jmcarthur> all die
2010-09-09T01:41:08  <jmcarthur> just like in 500/500/0
2010-09-09T01:41:40  <Zaphus> no, my method would have gone:   500/500/499  ->  249/250/0 -> 0/1/0    (kill the neutrals first)
2010-09-09T01:41:46  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.81.198> has quit IRC
2010-09-09T01:41:49  <jmcarthur> that's a great example to make me not like #1, for the record
2010-09-09T01:41:56  <jmcarthur> as that would leave neutral with 499 ships
2010-09-09T01:42:14  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: you method is unpredictable
2010-09-09T01:42:17  <Zaphus> yeah, that feels like we're doing battles in space, and we dont do that anywhere else
2010-09-09T01:42:18  <jmcarthur> i'd rather avoid randomness
2010-09-09T01:42:28  <antimatroid1> randomness == bad
2010-09-09T01:42:29  <jmcarthur> *your
2010-09-09T01:42:36  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: agreed, no good with odd numbers=bad
2010-09-09T01:42:46  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: method 2 is not actually random
2010-09-09T01:42:57  <jmcarthur> it would result in all players dying
2010-09-09T01:42:59  <jmcarthur> so would method 3
2010-09-09T01:43:01  <Zaphus> can you point me to the methods again ?
2010-09-09T01:43:05  <jmcarthur> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=419&start=0#p2419
2010-09-09T01:43:07  <AlliedEnvy> Hmm, perhaps this needs partial ships, at least temporarily during the calculations
2010-09-09T01:43:07  <contestbot> <http://ln-s.net/7_jJ> (at ai-contest.com)
2010-09-09T01:43:25  <jmcarthur> AlliedEnvy: yeah that is one variant that is equivalent to method 2
2010-09-09T01:43:49  <jmcarthur> "in the 'method 2' equivalence class" i'll call that
2010-09-09T01:44:27  <antimatroid1> i think half ships competing with each other is the best, i don't like the (20, 10) to neutral 20 result going to 0 owned by neutral, but I see no better option
2010-09-09T01:44:36  <antimatroid1> and reasonably easy to implement
2010-09-09T01:45:17  <antimatroid1> and it's still fair given the bots are expected to know that
2010-09-09T01:45:54  <antimatroid1> what if ownership was defined to change when ships hit 0 on a planet?
2010-09-09T01:45:58  <antimatroid1> would that make this any easier?
2010-09-09T01:46:29  <jmcarthur> you mean should a player be able to take ownership of a planet even with no ships left?
2010-09-09T01:46:33  <AlliedEnvy> That favors the attacker, slightly
2010-09-09T01:46:49  <antimatroid1> only shifts number of ships to send by 1
2010-09-09T01:46:52  <jmcarthur> that confuses the issue when both players attack a planet with equal forces and it all goes to 0
2010-09-09T01:47:03  <jmcarthur> (20,20) vs. 20
2010-09-09T01:47:05  <antimatroid1> yeah you're right, scratch that thought
2010-09-09T01:47:17  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.83.16> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-09T01:47:18  <Zaphus> ok, so if we go with method 3, how does a green planet fair - it needs different rules right, you merge the planet with the airborne forces for the fight:     1000G, 500R, 499G  == 999G
2010-09-09T01:47:25  <antimatroid1> seemingly easy problem is tricky!
2010-09-09T01:47:56  <antimatroid1> option 3 stinks
2010-09-09T01:47:56  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: method 3 is the simplest, IMO. the winner is the one with the most ships, and he loses the number of ships that the second largest force has
2010-09-09T01:48:17  <a1k0n> and all other forces lose everything
2010-09-09T01:48:28  <jmcarthur> yeah. that's a given in any of these
2010-09-09T01:48:35  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  but it feels wrong for 500 ships to arrive at a planet that has 499 ships, and 499 red, and it wins
2010-09-09T01:48:36  <AlliedEnvy> jmcarthur: But there's vanishing ships in that case
2010-09-09T01:48:47  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: with only 1 ship!
2010-09-09T01:49:05  <jmcarthur> AlliedEnvy: RGN triplets cancel out. that's the intuition
2010-09-09T01:49:19  <Zaphus> except it isnt intuition when it feels wrong
2010-09-09T01:49:19  <jmcarthur> and pairs cancel out after one side is gone
2010-09-09T01:49:25  <AlliedEnvy> Yes but each winning ship cancels two losing ships
2010-09-09T01:49:39  <jmcarthur> AlliedEnvy: that is what any 1v1v1 fight must do
2010-09-09T01:49:45  <Zaphus> resolve the air battle, then the land battle - thats what my gut says
2010-09-09T01:49:59  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: so method 1 then
2010-09-09T01:50:25  <a1k0n> i think method 1 is the most palatable
2010-09-09T01:50:30  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: which is the one that will leave 500R,500G,500N at 500N
2010-09-09T01:50:39  <a1k0n> even though method 3 might technically be the most fair
2010-09-09T01:50:39  <AlliedEnvy> with v1, N
2010-09-09T01:50:39  <Zaphus> for me, yeah.  just feels more like what I expect when I see the fleets flying in
2010-09-09T01:50:53  <AlliedEnvy> N can't send ships
2010-09-09T01:51:22  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: players fight each other first
2010-09-09T01:51:22  <Zaphus> basically it's giving Neutral the advantage, which is fine because nobody is playing that role...
2010-09-09T01:51:23  <a1k0n> but yeah, method 1 doesn't naturally generalize to >2 players unlike method 3
2010-09-09T01:51:23  <antimatroid1> option 1
2010-09-09T01:51:45  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  solve the 3 player version after the contest is done :-)
2010-09-09T01:51:57  <jmcarthur> yeah i'm not too concerned with >2 player games
2010-09-09T01:52:02  <antimatroid1> i would be down for a second n-player contest a month later

2010-09-09T01:54:55  <jmcarthur> we should decide on when to close the poll

2010-09-09T01:55:09  <lambdabot> voted on "method3"
2010-09-09T01:55:22  <Zaphus> pretty soon - you need to run the changes on the server for 24 hours if you can, so we can debug it
2010-09-09T01:55:29  <antimatroid1> i am pretty much indifferent
2010-09-09T01:55:46  <a1k0n> method3 generalizes, is fair, and is already implemented in a server patch
2010-09-09T01:55:47  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: i think only j3camero can do that anyway
2010-09-09T01:56:01  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: which will not be until tomorrow evening probably
2010-09-09T01:56:13  <a1k0n> i expect it'll be argued about on the forums throughout the entire contest
2010-09-09T01:56:19  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-09T01:56:20  <a1k0n> but if it's documented it's done
2010-09-09T01:56:31  <jmcarthur> we should let the poll continue until something can actually be done
2010-09-09T01:56:40  <Zaphus> I don't care about generalizing - and I'm not convinced about 'fair' because it makes the neutral planets effectively 0 whenever two larger fleets come in (they have no effect on the fight)
2010-09-09T01:56:42  <a1k0n> i was going to submit a svn branch but i just get 500 errors
2010-09-09T01:56:42  <amstan> guys, put the poll on the forums, it's much better there

2010-09-09T01:57:23  <jmcarthur> well
2010-09-09T01:57:34  <a1k0n> one has to admit method3 deepens the game tactically
2010-09-09T01:57:40  <jmcarthur> amstan: the problem is that it hasn't been discussed as deeply there. it's fresh on our minds here
2010-09-09T01:57:54  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  no, I don't have to admit that... even if it's true :)
2010-09-09T01:57:55  <antimatroid1> Maybe create a brand new thread on the forums outlining pro's cons of each?
2010-09-09T01:57:55  <jmcarthur> s/deeply/recently/ :P
2010-09-09T01:58:03  <antimatroid1> i really have to run, i'll jump on again from uni

2010-09-09T01:58:05  <a1k0n> yeah i'd say it's pretty in-depth on the forum
2010-09-09T01:58:06  <amstan> best*
2010-09-09T01:58:25  <jmcarthur> somebody else will have to do it aside from me
2010-09-09T01:58:30  <antimatroid1> a1k0n: new thread, clean and at the top
2010-09-09T01:58:34  <jmcarthur> whoever does it just make sure to be fair
2010-09-09T01:58:46  <antimatroid1> i would do it, but i really don't have the time, i should have left an hour ago
2010-09-09T01:58:47  <jmcarthur> i will place my vote tomorrow
2010-09-09T01:58:59  <Zaphus> Given how long there is left until the comp starts, choosing anything will be better than whats there now - all three of the methods have arguments for them
2010-09-09T01:59:17  <Zaphus> I just want to know what to type into by bot to make it smarter :-)
2010-09-09T01:59:19  <a1k0n> yes, there's no argument for "let's have fleets randomly disappear"
2010-09-09T01:59:29  <jmcarthur> but we still have to wait for j3camero to put it on the server. since we have time anyway, we might as well use it for the poll

2010-09-09T02:03:43  <antimatroid1> people are going to be trigger friendly about their vote without really thinking
2010-09-09T02:03:56  <antimatroid1> could you at least post what is currently possibly considered the better option?
2010-09-09T02:04:00  <AlliedEnvy> hmmm, negative ships, that can't be good
2010-09-09T02:04:22  <antimatroid1> i will write up a detailed post in technical issues tomorrow that can be stickied for moaners to be directed towards
2010-09-09T02:05:59  <Zaphus> maybe just write up #3 as the way it's going to go (seems to be favoured here right now).   It really doesnt matter in the end as long as it is predictable, it's just rules.  you could say that the neutral fleet retreats to another planet and only fights if there are none left, it wouldnt matter - it's just rules
2010-09-09T02:06:40  <antimatroid1> if there was an obvious best choice, we'd go with it, but I don't think there is
2010-09-09T02:07:01  <antimatroid1> hence allowing more people to have some say i think makes it "more fair"
2010-09-09T02:09:02  <Zaphus> with the exception of time, and that design-by-committee is rarely the best.   The more I think about it, the more #3 seems OK to me.

2010-09-09T02:16:57  <a1k0n> the third is what seems best though the first is what seems most natural

2010-09-09T02:24:40  <kozlovsky> i may be miss important discussion, but #3 seems ideal
2010-09-09T02:25:31  <seigen-web> ah, i lied
2010-09-09T02:26:20  <a1k0n> hmm with the rewritten combat resolution it's still biased towards player 1
2010-09-09T02:26:25  <dhartmei_> #3 is somewhat unnatural as a ship can die without killing another
2010-09-09T02:26:41  <dhartmei_> i.e. the sum doesn't remain odd/even necessarily
2010-09-09T02:26:49  <a1k0n> dhartmei_: agreed unless you consider a three-way-battle where they all kill each other equally
2010-09-09T02:26:50  <Scrap> how can I run ./tcp with java? I was unable to do it...
2010-09-09T02:27:01  <Scrap> with a java bot
2010-09-09T02:27:19  <a1k0n> Scrap: make a wrapper script such that you can run with a single filename instead of a java -jar commandline
2010-09-09T02:27:49  <Scrap> I have tried, but it didn't work
2010-09-09T02:28:36  <a1k0n> hmm the fleet disappearing might be more fundamental

2010-09-09T02:30:47  <Scrap> a1k0n: it says execv: MyBot.sh: failed
2010-09-09T02:31:00  <a1k0n> is MyBot.sh executable and does it have #!/bin/sh?
2010-09-09T02:31:20  <a1k0n> tcp.c needs a perror("execv") there or something
2010-09-09T02:31:22  <seigen-web> a1k0n: Scrap: alternately, put the whole command in quotes
2010-09-09T02:31:33  <seigen-web> e.g. "java -jar foo.jar"
2010-09-09T02:31:39  <a1k0n> seigen-web: that doesn't work beacuse the whole command is issued as the first argument to execv()
2010-09-09T02:31:56  <Scrap> a1k0n: i forgot about #!bin thanks :)

2010-09-09T03:29:51  <AlliedEnvy> Like if you treat each force as the length of a potential triangle - if it forms a triangle, everyone loses, otherwise the winner is the longest side, with remaining forces minus the sum of the other two sides

2010-09-09T03:31:55  <AlliedEnvy> Basically, for any player A to win, A > B+C, then what's left is A-B-C
2010-09-09T03:32:41  <kozlovsky> that is, #1
2010-09-09T03:33:04  <AlliedEnvy> It's #1 but with the first rule applied to neutral
2010-09-09T03:34:14  <AlliedEnvy> Rather, it treats neutral as just another player
2010-09-09T03:36:15  <kozlovsky> Take concrete example: neutral=10, red=11, blue=12

2010-09-09T03:37:06  <antimatroidUni> no they don't
2010-09-09T03:37:15  <antimatroidUni> 12 - 11 - 10 = -9
2010-09-09T03:37:26  <a1k0n> i mean in "method 3" or whatever.
2010-09-09T03:37:34  <antimatroidUni> oh, okay
2010-09-09T03:38:19  <AlliedEnvy> With this "triangle" method, neutral keeps it with 0
2010-09-09T03:39:10  <kozlovsky> so, if blue issues fleet 11 and the fleet 1 it is better then fleet 12
2010-09-09T03:39:18  <kozlovsky> *then
2010-09-09T03:39:46  <AlliedEnvy> Hmm yes
2010-09-09T03:40:59  * Zannick found the bug for issue 72
2010-09-09T03:41:08  <Zannick> totally my fault :( sorry guys
2010-09-09T03:41:27  <a1k0n> what really?
2010-09-09T03:42:09  <Zannick> yeah i moved an if block out of a loop and it had a break statement in it
2010-09-09T03:42:22  <a1k0n> huh
2010-09-09T03:42:28  <a1k0n> what's weird is, even in the rewritten code i see this happening
2010-09-09T03:42:48  <Zannick> no, the rewritten code is where the bug is
2010-09-09T03:42:58  <Zannick> i just posted the fix to issue 72
2010-09-09T03:43:04  <Zannick> which is to remove the break statement
2010-09-09T03:43:18  <a1k0n> i mean the rewritten battle code patch from issue 64
2010-09-09T03:43:26  <Zannick> oh
2010-09-09T03:44:11  <Zannick> wait, fleets are disappearing in engine.py, too?
2010-09-09T03:44:28  <a1k0n> no, i actually don't know but i'm looking at the rewritten java version
2010-09-09T03:44:51  <a1k0n> i have two planets in the center with 20, both with 13-sized fleets from enemies arriving
2010-09-09T03:45:02  <a1k0n> on the next frame, one has 12 and the other has 25
2010-09-09T03:45:10  <a1k0n> (they're 5-growth planets)
2010-09-09T03:45:24  <Zannick> yeah, the rewritten java version has the bug
2010-09-09T03:45:48  <a1k0n> i just can't see how
2010-09-09T03:45:49  <Zannick> namely, if any planet is taken over, no other planet is taken over
2010-09-09T03:46:04  <a1k0n> this isn't even a takeover situation
2010-09-09T03:46:13  <a1k0n> it's a different fleet-disappearance bug
2010-09-09T03:46:22  <Zannick> oh
2010-09-09T03:49:52  <Zannick> are those the only two fleets landing on that turn?
2010-09-09T03:50:11  <a1k0n> i believe so
2010-09-09T03:50:16  <a1k0n> yes

2010-09-09T03:54:10  <Zannick> should be
2010-09-09T03:54:40  <Zannick> ugly, but ends up comparing addresses
2010-09-09T03:54:43  <a1k0n> yeah no reason the pointer would change
2010-09-09T03:56:57  <AlliedEnvy> well, Planet implements cloneable, maybe it should have a .equals() method
2010-09-09T03:56:59  <Zannick> hm, the code is wrong where it chooses winner and second, but that's not the problem
2010-09-09T03:57:34  <a1k0n> how so?
2010-09-09T03:58:47  <Zannick> as it proceeds through the list, if it sees a new max, make it max and what was max make second
2010-09-09T03:59:13  <Zannick> say the fleets are 6 and 5
2010-09-09T03:59:25  <Zannick> first max becomes 6, then 5 is not better than 6...
2010-09-09T03:59:31  <a1k0n> oh haha right
2010-09-09T03:59:36  <Zannick> so we end with max=6, second=0
2010-09-09T03:59:39  <a1k0n> shit that's probably what's wrong with it
2010-09-09T03:59:55  <Zannick> that's definitely a multiple invasion bug
2010-09-09T04:00:00  <a1k0n> or even single
2010-09-09T04:00:13  <a1k0n> if there are 20 neutral ships and 13 attacking ships and it sees the 20 but fails to see the 13
2010-09-09T04:00:18  <a1k0n> that's what it is.  good catch.
2010-09-09T04:00:21  <Zannick> oooh, you're right
2010-09-09T04:03:07  <a1k0n> http://paste.lisp.org/display/114374
2010-09-09T04:03:09  <a1k0n> that look right to you?
2010-09-09T04:03:11  <a1k0n> i'm really tired
2010-09-09T04:03:30  <Zannick> so am i, but I'm commenting on the review
2010-09-09T04:04:10  <a1k0n> yay now my bot draws against itself so i think that did it
2010-09-09T04:04:40  <Zannick> that looks fine to me, i was going to do nearly the same thing, but with if (> winner) { } else if (> second)
2010-09-09T04:04:43  <a1k0n> oh haha that doesn't work at all
2010-09-09T04:04:53  <a1k0n> all planets are stuck at 0
2010-09-09T04:04:57  <Zannick> oh, haha
2010-09-09T04:05:06  <Zannick> you have second and winner lines mixed up in the first case
2010-09-09T04:05:13  <a1k0n> ops
2010-09-09T04:05:26  <a1k0n> definitely tired
2010-09-09T04:06:47  <a1k0n> bug probably exists in python version too eh
2010-09-09T04:07:38  <Zannick> yeah, it's the same code but in python
2010-09-09T04:08:10  <a1k0n> yep fixed
2010-09-09T04:08:17  <Palmik> Hmm, does planet become neutral when there are 0 ships at the given planet?
2010-09-09T04:08:25  <Palmik> As it should
2010-09-09T04:08:32  <a1k0n> it keeps its owner and continues to grow
2010-09-09T04:08:38  <a1k0n> you need one extra to take it
2010-09-09T04:08:54  <Palmik> Hmm... I see, is it intended?
2010-09-09T04:08:59  <a1k0n> i believe so
2010-09-09T04:09:04  <dhartmei_> i'd say so, those rules are explicit
2010-09-09T04:09:09  <Palmik> Ok, thanks
2010-09-09T04:09:14  <Zannick> only if it becomes 0 from three-way battle...which can only happen at the moment with three or more players, afaik
2010-09-09T04:09:47  <a1k0n> in the revised code it keeps its owner even in that case
2010-09-09T04:09:56  <Zannick> cool
2010-09-09T04:10:09  <Zannick> wow, i'm tired, too

2010-09-09T04:15:35  <a1k0n> hahah
2010-09-09T04:15:39  <Zannick> another absurdly entertaining match http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4414986
2010-09-09T04:15:45  <McLeopold> there was a stalemate for awhile, I wonder who would have won?

2010-09-09T04:18:00  <Zannick> my bot tends to win when the opponent really wants the center planet

2010-09-09T04:20:17  <Zannick> and not tournament infrastructure
2010-09-09T04:20:23  <Zannick> :P
2010-09-09T04:20:25  <a1k0n> i really wanted to figure out why the java viz is sooooo slow at parsing its input tonight
2010-09-09T04:20:32  <a1k0n> but i'm way too tired to do that now
2010-09-09T04:20:47  <a1k0n> anyway it's unfair to work on your bot and not the tournament until friday. :)

2010-09-09T04:25:37  <Zannick> i have two or three separate one-line fixes for bugs waiting on him to put them in trunk himself or give me the okay to do so
2010-09-09T04:26:29  <a1k0n> it's too bad you can't promote an issue with a code review

2010-09-09T06:32:30  <Javache> danielvf: yup
2010-09-09T06:33:02  <Javache> what is your idea on getting the game data from the PlayGame.jar to javascript?
2010-09-09T06:33:09  <Javache> i'm not really clear on that
2010-09-09T06:34:04  <aerique> Javache: it writes it to standard out so if you don't pipe it to ShowGame.jar you can just grab it.
2010-09-09T06:34:22  <Javache> aerique: yeah, but it's another thing to get it in a live webpage
2010-09-09T06:34:52  <Javache> there's probably a cool html5 technology we could use for that ;)
2010-09-09T06:35:40  <danielvf> Well, we need a server of some kind

2010-09-09T06:39:35  <Javache> danielvf: might be worth trying out
2010-09-09T06:39:41  <Javache> but might be overkill too
2010-09-09T06:40:41  <danielvf> Javache: We could run the official game server python code in there as well.
2010-09-09T06:41:26  <Javache> and provide the whole system of running the bots etc?
2010-09-09T06:41:32  <danielvf> Yeah
2010-09-09T06:42:06  <Javache> I like the idea of not being responsible for running the game, and just having to parse it
2010-09-09T06:42:37  <danielvf> We should patch the game runner jar, to stream output, rather than wait until the end

2010-09-09T06:43:29  <Javache> danielvf: have you looked at the websockets?
2010-09-09T06:43:44  <Javache> we could have the client in the browser connect to a certain port and listen there for input
2010-09-09T06:44:02  <danielvf> Javache: yeah, like you said.
2010-09-09T06:44:04  <Javache> and a python script in the console that listens for input from the game runner and sends that to the client
2010-09-09T06:44:07  <danielvf> Yup
2010-09-09T06:44:16  <danielvf> Don't even need websockets
2010-09-09T06:44:29  <danielvf> Just slowly hand out stuff over http
2010-09-09T06:44:44  <danielvf> (I've tried it and it works)
2010-09-09T06:45:33  <Javache> we'll have to look how that works with restaring the gamerunner etc
2010-09-09T06:46:13  <Javache> brb lunch
2010-09-09T06:46:17  <danielvf> So the local visualizer python thing could open it's own webserver, and then send the user's browser to that port. If we inline the css and javascript into the
2010-09-09T06:46:18  <danielvf> laters
2010-09-09T06:46:33  <danielvf> into the page, then w only need to handle one request
2010-09-09T06:46:52  <danielvf> after that one request, the server would shut down.
2010-09-09T06:47:31  <danielvf> The server would just drag out the last of the page, adding script tags with turn data.

2010-09-09T08:35:15  <javagamer> I'm not certain I'm overloading the right operator, this is just based off of some code I found for sorting w/ an object
2010-09-09T08:39:20  <antimatroidUni> shouldn't it be like
2010-09-09T08:39:23  <Racko> um, I guess the comparison function object (third argument) should not be a pointer (this) but the object itself (*this)
2010-09-09T08:39:53  <antimatroidUni> bool operator<(const myObject &a, const myObject &b)?
2010-09-09T08:40:05  <antimatroidUni> i don't know heaps sorry

2010-09-09T08:40:55  <Racko> great
2010-09-09T08:41:46  <Palmik> I usually use pointer to bool functions or bool functors, since it gives me more freedom :)

2010-09-09T08:43:02  <javagamer> Well, this depends on the location of a planet so I thought it'd be easier to use an object
2010-09-09T08:43:21  <javagamer> If I used a function I'd have to also use global variables I believe
2010-09-09T08:43:58  <javagamer> The Distance function I was using relied on the position of the object I'm using to compare
2010-09-09T08:44:31  <Palmik> no... you would just make statci member function with signature like this
2010-09-09T08:45:01  <Palmik> static bool Planet::compareByDistance(const Planet& planet1, const Planet& planet2)
2010-09-09T08:46:10  <Palmik> then you could use sord like this std::sort(planets.begin(), planets.end(), Planet::compareByDistance)
2010-09-09T08:46:14  <Palmik> *sort
2010-09-09T08:48:42  <Zaphus> the return value is incorrect
2010-09-09T08:49:03  <Zaphus> you have to return:   -1 for less than, 0 for equal, 1 for greater than   - your return can only return 2 values
2010-09-09T08:49:50  <Zaphus> if (a<b) return 1; else if (b<a) return -1; else return 0;    (might have the 1, -1 back to front)
2010-09-09T08:50:04  <Palmik> for sort's 3rd argument the function or functor usually returns true of the the first argument should stay before the sond
2010-09-09T08:50:15  <Palmik> *before the second
2010-09-09T08:50:27  <Zaphus> no, its a three-value return - trust me
2010-09-09T08:50:55  <Zaphus> usually you cheat and    return b-a;    because it's just looking at the sign and zero state
2010-09-09T08:51:48  <Zaphus> oh, sorry... i just naturally assumed you were using the inbuilt qsort( )
2010-09-09T08:51:56  <Zaphus> if thats a roll your own sort then ignore me
2010-09-09T08:52:27  <Palmik> it's in-buit std::sort :)
2010-09-09T08:52:46  <Palmik> we were talking about
2010-09-09T08:53:08  <Zaphus> huh, ok, never used that one before - I always use qsort
2010-09-09T08:53:44  <danielvf> Javache: Committed the canvas visualizer to a branch on the live site
2010-09-09T08:53:58  <danielvf> Javache:  maybe they will put it up today
2010-09-09T08:54:06  <Palmik> Zaphus, does qsort work on stl containers?
2010-09-09T08:55:01  <Zaphus> it's data-agnostic, just works on blobs of data... probably not a good idea if you are already using std::sort (which can be faster, it appears... you learn something every day!)
2010-09-09T08:56:56  <Zaphus> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/    looks similar to your code,  are you in the right namespace ?
2010-09-09T08:57:30  <Palmik> yeah, that is std::sort :)
2010-09-09T08:57:57  <Palmik> I guess javagamer is using it from what he has shown
2010-09-09T08:59:08  <javagamer> That's where I got what I had from
2010-09-09T09:00:12  <Palmik> they are using functor in their example, but you can use normal function and pass pointer to that function as the Comparator... for simple ordering such function is usually enought :)

2010-09-09T09:03:13  <Racko> He is comparing the input planets with the planet *this is referring to, so a static function is not an option. But a non-static one would do it of course.
2010-09-09T09:03:40  <Racko> unless I'm wrong, that is^^

2010-09-09T10:03:31  <Palmik> s_denchev, you are right, because the coloser your source planet is to your destination planet, the lower is the chance that the opponent can react in time... there is probably more to it :)
2010-09-09T10:05:08  <Palmik> javagamer, look for variadic functions... I!m sure there is some library for your langugage if it does not support it out of the box
2010-09-09T10:05:45  <javagamer> I'm working in C++, I see how to access each argument individually, but I can't seem to figure out how to pass a variable number of them
2010-09-09T10:07:06  <javagamer> Palmik, I'm just pretty much trying to wrap fprintf for easier debugging

2010-09-09T10:10:23  <javagamer> I'm trying to get my output as a file and just want to wrap fprintf to handle all the file specific stuff that won't change so all I have to do is call log(char data[], ...)

2010-09-09T10:12:09  <Palmik> so maybe this? http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/vfprintf/ it writes to specified file
2010-09-09T10:12:56  <Palmik> you can ofcourse wrap it to some log(char data[], ...) function where the file is set in stone
2010-09-09T10:13:15  <javagamer> Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out how to accomplish
2010-09-09T10:13:25  <javagamer> but I think I just found it
2010-09-09T10:13:36  <Palmik> there is an example on the last link

2010-09-09T10:46:33  <phreeza> it had a bug
2010-09-09T10:46:38  <phreeza> but i just fixed it
2010-09-09T10:46:53  <antimatroid1> if you are willing to do the work, you'll be fine, otherwise you probably shouldn't be there in the first place anyway

2010-09-09T10:47:21  <antimatroid1> albert_: yeah sort of, you basically define measurable sets etc. using sigma algebras
2010-09-09T10:47:24  <phreeza> it works here
2010-09-09T10:47:56  <antimatroid1> i still don't really understand it very much yet though
2010-09-09T10:48:36  <albert_> phreeza: i mean the replays here: http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3891 it seems that your bot does not even start to play

2010-09-09T11:04:05  <bss03> I guess it should be fine to include those in the Haskell starter as well.
2010-09-09T11:04:39  <bss03> Still, it would be nice not to have to use Java to test my Haskell.  Might write a simulartor once I get done translating the exmaple bots.

2010-09-09T11:06:36  <jmcarthur> and the visualizer on the unofficial web site is a lot nicer
2010-09-09T11:06:52  <jmcarthur> that visualizer will be on the official site soon, i think

2010-09-09T11:07:33  <jmcarthur> bss03: there's a python version of it too that's used for the backend on the server
2010-09-09T11:07:40  <jmcarthur> of the engine i mean

2010-09-09T11:08:19  <bss03> Looks to be like the unofficial server engine is in C.
2010-09-09T11:08:23  <jmcarthur> bss03: if you are dead set on making a haskell version of the engine, talk to mightybyte. i think he was also interested in working on one
2010-09-09T11:08:54  <bss03> Nah, C or Python is probably fine; I already have those installed and working well.
2010-09-09T11:09:18  <jmcarthur> bss03: there is an effort to make that javascript canvas visualizer nicer to use locally, too
2010-09-09T11:09:53  <jmcarthur> bss03: the plan seems to be along the lines of using the python engine to stream output to the canvas visualizer with an http connection
2010-09-09T11:10:57  <Palmik> it already works locally
2010-09-09T11:11:30  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: So what's the status on being able to use Haskell in the contest?
2010-09-09T11:12:07  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: ghc 6.12.3 just isn't going to happen. i'm trying to convince j3camero to just allow binary submissions
2010-09-09T11:12:38  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: ubuntu 8.04 just doesn't have the infrastructure for modern ghc and i don't feel like trying to fix that (after trying and failing for two days straight)
2010-09-09T11:12:52  <mightybyte> ugh
2010-09-09T11:13:24  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: the binary submission idea is being taken pretty seriously though. i think we can convince him
2010-09-09T11:13:50  <mightybyte> I've done enough playing with it in haskell over the last couple days that if Haskell submissions aren't allowed I'll be much less likely to compete.
2010-09-09T11:14:12  <antimatroid1> mightybite: lies! it's way too much fun
2010-09-09T11:14:18  <jmcarthur> i almost dropped last time because i kept hitting problems with ghc 6.8.2 (which the server still has)
2010-09-09T11:14:44  <mightybyte> Hmmm, I don't see myself doing anything that 6.8.2 can't do.
2010-09-09T11:14:45  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: also, we had to disable template haskell on the server last night, just fyi
2010-09-09T11:15:11  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i managed to exploit it because the compilation doesn't take place in a sandbox. i think you can see where that goes
2010-09-09T11:15:51  <jmcarthur> if you're happy with ghc 6.8.2, be my guest
2010-09-09T11:15:54  <jmcarthur> i was not happy with it last time
2010-09-09T11:16:40  <mightybyte> But my problem is that I'm contemplating using some hackage libraries and I wasn't sure whether they'd be available.
2010-09-09T11:16:52  <jmcarthur> binary submissions would fix that :)
2010-09-09T11:16:57  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Yeah
2010-09-09T11:17:12  <jmcarthur> i'm using all kinds of libraries
2010-09-09T11:17:15  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Yeah, I saw you talking about exploits last night and I figured you were doing TH.
2010-09-09T11:17:17  <jmcarthur> premptively
2010-09-09T11:17:44  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: can you see any reason that ghc-pkg hide template-haskell might be insufficient, btw?
2010-09-09T11:17:50  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: the issue is mainly runIO
2010-09-09T11:18:12  <mightybyte> That seems like it should do the trick, but I could be overlooking something.
2010-09-09T11:18:13  <jmcarthur> is it possible, that you know of, to import a module in a hidden package by force?
2010-09-09T11:18:24  <mightybyte> Not that I know of.
2010-09-09T11:18:27  <jmcarthur> good
2010-09-09T11:18:29  <jmcarthur> me either
2010-09-09T11:18:31  <antimatroid1> I look forward to hearing all the different ways people went about trying to solve this at the end (although from chatter so far it seems people aren't that different), cause last time it was pretty obvious how people went about it, just needed to work out how they evaluated states and handled a few different bits and pieces
2010-09-09T11:18:48  <jmcarthur> i think my idea will be unique enough
2010-09-09T11:18:59  <jmcarthur> not so sure about effectiveness...
2010-09-09T11:19:00  <mightybyte> antimatroid1: I think this contest has more potential for variation.
2010-09-09T11:19:17  <jmcarthur> yeah, more tactical variety, but maybe not as much visual variety
2010-09-09T11:19:24  <jmcarthur> tron has the nice property of being very pretty
2010-09-09T11:19:39  <mightybyte> I think these games are fun to watch.

2010-09-09T11:23:57  <bss03> Plus, I'm not sure I know how to make a statically linked executable with ghc, so I imagine my binary solutions would be missing a number of .so files. :P
2010-09-09T11:23:58  <jmcarthur> i considered it last time, but there's all sorts of libraries and stuff that have to be linked in too, plus the somewhat limited way you can compile things at all
2010-09-09T11:24:19  <phreeza> is anybody doing some form of actual search of the decision tree?
2010-09-09T11:24:37  <jmcarthur> phreeza: albert claims to have an idea to actually solve the game
2010-09-09T11:24:55  <antimatroid1> searching the game tree as is is futile
2010-09-09T11:25:00  <jmcarthur> definitely
2010-09-09T11:25:04  <phreeza> jmcarthur yea hes a friend of mine, i've been discussing that with him
2010-09-09T11:25:09  <antimatroid1> if you want to do that, you need to start reducing the number of ideal strategies on each turn
2010-09-09T11:25:15  <jmcarthur> but certain properties about this game seem similar to a linear programming problem or something

2010-09-09T11:25:32  <phreeza> speak of the devil
2010-09-09T11:25:33  <bss03> I thought about searching the game tree, but it seems a bit complex.
2010-09-09T11:25:44  <albert_> back :)
2010-09-09T11:25:46  <bss03> You'd have to severely limit the "legal moves".
2010-09-09T11:25:51  <phreeza> yea i think on a per turn basis it is really futile
2010-09-09T11:25:52  <albert_> is there any implementation of the game engine in c++?
2010-09-09T11:25:54  <antimatroid1> still seemed like there was too much information for simplex to me
2010-09-09T11:26:01  <phreeza> but maybe there is some kind of abstraction
2010-09-09T11:26:20  <jmcarthur> albert_: to make sure i'm not putting words into your mouth, you were saying earlier that you suspect there is a way to solve the game?
2010-09-09T11:26:29  <antimatroid1> yes, he did say that
2010-09-09T11:26:56  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: yeah i'm not sure exactly what sort of closed form solution there might be
2010-09-09T11:27:10  <bss03> My first simplification was going to be analysing the game in a rest state -- assuming the existing fleets complete their movement and no more fleets are spawned.
2010-09-09T11:27:12  <antimatroid1> i have a few ideas where one might come from
2010-09-09T11:27:14  <antimatroid1> but i dunno
2010-09-09T11:27:18  <albert_> jmcarthur: yes i think there is. at least in theory, i'm not sure if you can calculate it fast enough
2010-09-09T11:27:23  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-09T11:27:32  <jmcarthur> yeah, i'm 100% sure there is in theory :P
2010-09-09T11:27:35  <antimatroid1> well, yeah der :P
2010-09-09T11:27:43  <bss03> Then limit commands to one order, and advance the game state as if the flight were instantaneous.
2010-09-09T11:28:13  <bss03> Then fix fleet sizes.  Still, even with all of that the game tree would be huge.
2010-09-09T11:28:18  <phreeza> bss03 i think assuming instantaneous flight is problematic
2010-09-09T11:28:43  <phreeza> i do that right now and its the main problem i have
2010-09-09T11:28:51  <albert_> has anyone tried logic resolution on this problem?
2010-09-09T11:29:02  <phreeza> especially in the beginning its  crucial to build momentum faster than the oponent
2010-09-09T11:29:03  <antimatroid1> as in solving it analytically?
2010-09-09T11:29:07  <antimatroid1> i have, it's fucking complicated
2010-09-09T11:29:10  <antimatroid1> there are sooo many variables
2010-09-09T11:29:19  <bss03> Oh, yes, with those simplifications, the scores for some states would be quite off, but probably not degenerate enough to mess you up.
2010-09-09T11:29:40  <mightybyte> Have any of you guys played the linux version of this game called Konquest?
2010-09-09T11:29:40  <albert_> any description of the game logic in prolog or so?
2010-09-09T11:29:41  <bss03> IT would definitely cause some horizon issue, where you thought a move was good and instead it sucks.

2010-09-09T11:29:58  <phreeza> this is frustrating, my old bot, which is a modification of the example i made in about 15 minutes, is still doing way better than my new one :)
2010-09-09T11:30:15  <bss03> albert_ if you can read python there's a svn tree of containing an engine.
2010-09-09T11:30:36  <albert_> bss03: yea but i need an implementation in c++
2010-09-09T11:30:43  <albert_> ok i probably will recode it in c++
2010-09-09T11:31:04  <albert_> i will put it online somewhere in case someone else is interested. i think it might be quite useful
2010-09-09T11:31:15  <phreeza> albert_: so i am guessing you want to extrapolate with the exact rules?
2010-09-09T11:31:29  <phreeza> i also wonder if maybe monte carlo methods could work...
2010-09-09T11:32:02  <mightybyte> Konquest adds one more dimension to the game.  Each planet has a kill percent that governs the effectiveness of fleets sent from that planet.
2010-09-09T11:32:03  <phreeza> monte carlo minimax, sth like that
2010-09-09T11:32:15  <bss03> albert_ The python version, much like the java version, does not care what langauge the bots are in.
2010-09-09T11:32:20  <mightybyte> I've been trying to decide whether I think that added dimension makes the game simpler or more complex.
2010-09-09T11:32:30  <albert_> phreeza: yea. at least some game path. i will try to simplify the code so that i can calculate a resulting gamestate in linear time based on a set of commands
2010-09-09T11:32:33  <bss03> albert_ It just "exec"s the process and feed it data.
2010-09-09T11:32:54  <albert_> bss03: yea i know. but i need to calculate some possible game trees
2010-09-09T11:33:30  <jmcarthur> phreeza: monte carlo still will only touch a *very* tiny portion of all possible games, of course
2010-09-09T11:33:32  <bss03> Ah, recoding in your language of choice is probably the way to go then.
2010-09-09T11:33:48  <antimatroid1> how are you guys setting up fleets? I couldn't traverse a priority queue, so I have an ordered vector that adds new fleets in from the back
2010-09-09T11:33:48  <albert_> yea exactly :)
2010-09-09T11:33:53  <jmcarthur> phreeza: it was hard enough in tron (i did monte carlo with UCT)
2010-09-09T11:34:32  <phreeza> jmcarthur yea, i'm hoping maybe because of the "linearity" of the whole thing it still might be effective
2010-09-09T11:34:42  <albert_> antimatroid1: yea or an ordered list if you need fast insertion at the end/front
2010-09-09T11:34:43  <antimatroid1> and i merge fleets with the same arrival time
2010-09-09T11:34:47  <bss03> The engine is fairly simple anyway.  Trip length is just ceil(cartian_distance).  Conquest is just subtraction, abs, etc.
2010-09-09T11:35:19  <antimatroid1> bss03: i set up a vector of distances for indexing first move rather than pinging the egine for that over and over and over
2010-09-09T11:35:21  <phreeza> for example it would be good enough to have a sample above and below the critical amount of ships sent to conquer a planet to get the basic idea of the outcome
2010-09-09T11:36:12  <jmcarthur> phreeza: so you mean have sort of interpolation between samples to obtain the final set of commands?
2010-09-09T11:36:24  <phreeza> jmcarthur: how did it work out there? minimax seems much more feasible in tron
2010-09-09T11:36:25  <jmcarthur> between *good* samples, i mean
2010-09-09T11:36:43  <jmcarthur> phreeza: it worked pretty well. i didn't have time to finish my bot though, so i only got 105th place
2010-09-09T11:36:49  <jmcarthur> phreeza: 3rd place out of the haskell entries at least
2010-09-09T11:37:05  <antimatroid1> i got jewed over by that time limit rule
2010-09-09T11:37:12  <jmcarthur> phreeza: i believed then and now that minimax was actually inappropriate for tron
2010-09-09T11:37:16  <antimatroid1> i didn't even realise it caused dq till it happened
2010-09-09T11:37:41  <jmcarthur> but i got too busy to add mixed strategies to my bot
2010-09-09T11:37:42  <phreeza> jmcarthur: really, there its just 3 choices per turn, right?
2010-09-09T11:37:47  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: I disagree, you can add more to it, but you need the tree

2010-09-09T11:38:08  <antimatroid1> it was worth separating out chambers etc.
2010-09-09T11:38:10  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: a game tree is fine. minimax is not :P

2010-09-09T11:39:12  <antimatroid1> minimax was fine i swear
2010-09-09T11:39:26  <antimatroid1> provided you got the payoff function decent
2010-09-09T11:39:33  <antimatroid1> and didn't stop after one of your moves
2010-09-09T11:39:40  <jmcarthur> there was a whole thread about this, wasn't there?
2010-09-09T11:39:46  <antimatroid1> no idea :P
2010-09-09T11:39:57  <jmcarthur> somebody came up with a good example against minimax
2010-09-09T11:40:24  <jmcarthur> where and optimal eval function would still result in minimax giving the wrong move
2010-09-09T11:40:26  <jmcarthur> *an
2010-09-09T11:40:52  <antimatroid1> hmmm, okay
2010-09-09T11:40:58  <jmcarthur> the main argument in that thread in favor of minimax was people guessing that situations like that were rare
2010-09-09T11:41:05  <jmcarthur> but nobody provided evidence of that
2010-09-09T11:43:34  <jmcarthur> in fact, i speculate that if a bot could determine whether its opponent was using minimax then it could exploit it
2010-09-09T11:43:56  <jmcarthur> i found that old thread, but the informative images are missing :(
2010-09-09T11:44:06  <antimatroid1> i dunno, you are guarenteed to do at least as well as you expect

2010-09-09T11:47:00  <jmcarthur> if your opponent is using minimax then it could miss an opportunity to minimize your second best move. that is after minimizing your best move, your second best move becomes your best move. if your bot is aware of this, then it can exploit that, since the moves are actually simulataneous

2010-09-09T11:50:14  <antimatroid1> simplex on larger matrices would be
2010-09-09T11:50:38  <jmcarthur> just use 3x3 simplex on each node of the game tree to evaluate the node

2010-09-09T11:54:47  <antimatroid1> erm... engine internals are so much more important for this game
2010-09-09T11:54:53  <antimatroid1> it's going to be a central topic

2010-09-09T12:08:14  <drewrobb> my bot doesn't go for the kill sometimes
2010-09-09T12:08:52  <antimatroid1> i expect it to be worth just checking that if you have time
2010-09-09T12:09:00  <coventry> Yes, they're just shared libraries.
2010-09-09T12:09:25  <jmcarthur> coventry: it's probably okay then. i'm actually trying to push for allowing arbitrary binaries
2010-09-09T12:09:36  <antimatroid1> although it usually doesn't matter if you get deadlocked but cane them on number of ships
2010-09-09T12:09:37  <coventry> Thanks.
2010-09-09T12:09:40  <jmcarthur> coventry: it's probably okay if it technically works, that is
2010-09-09T12:09:57  <jmcarthur> coventry: might want to ask j3camero though
2010-09-09T12:09:59  <coventry> jmcarthur: It definitely works with a standard python install.
2010-09-09T12:10:14  <jmcarthur> coventry: he will be around this evening
2010-09-09T12:10:20  <coventry> jmcarthur: OK, will do.
2010-09-09T12:10:29  <antimatroid1> i would be surprised if it wasn't ok, but definitely worth checking

2010-09-09T12:12:49  <jmcarthur> coventry: i think the server runs 64 bit ubuntu 8.04, for the record, so you need 64 bit modules (unless python is 32 bit for some reason)
2010-09-09T12:14:16  <coventry> jmcarthur: that sounds workable.
2010-09-09T12:14:46  <javagamer> Hey, does anyone else have fleets just disappear on reaching a planet?
2010-09-09T12:15:02  <javagamer> My friend saw it happen yesterday and I'm seeing it right now
2010-09-09T12:15:10  <javagamer> They don't subtract, they just vanish
2010-09-09T12:15:14  <jmcarthur> there have been a lot of reports of that
2010-09-09T12:15:15  <antimatroid1> where abouts?
2010-09-09T12:15:53  <jmcarthur> aw, ebrahim informed me on reddit that he won't be participating this time
2010-09-09T12:16:01  <jmcarthur> he had a good bot in the last one
2010-09-09T12:16:08  <antimatroid1> yeah, i was going to say
2010-09-09T12:16:14  <antimatroid1> did he give a reason?
2010-09-09T12:16:19  <jmcarthur> not enough time he said
2010-09-09T12:16:28  <antimatroid1> neither do i
2010-09-09T12:16:33  <jmcarthur> he shows more restraint than i
2010-09-09T12:16:36  <antimatroid1> but this kind of trumps other stuff
2010-09-09T12:16:38  <jmcarthur> i don't have the time at all :P
2010-09-09T12:16:46  <jmcarthur> and look what i'm doing instead of making money@!
2010-09-09T12:17:05  <antimatroid1> i seriously considered dropping one of my majors just to spent more time on the bot aha
2010-09-09T12:17:08  <javagamer> The disappearing fleet happened on my first move
2010-09-09T12:17:12  <antimatroid1> but i'm just going to man up
2010-09-09T12:17:15  <drewrobb> i have seen the fleets dissapearing bug a bunch
2010-09-09T12:17:24  <seigen> hirded
2010-09-09T12:17:27  <seigen> thirded, even
2010-09-09T12:17:31  <javagamer> I doubt this is related, but my confirmation email similarly disappeared
2010-09-09T12:18:04  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: would be awesome if you could make this an independent study course
2010-09-09T12:18:25  <jmcarthur> or whatever equivalent your uni may have
2010-09-09T12:18:29  <antimatroid1> nah, too many units to take alrady
2010-09-09T12:18:40  <antimatroid1> and my uni "computing" department sucks
2010-09-09T12:18:45  <jmcarthur> mine did too
2010-09-09T12:18:50  <jmcarthur> horrible experience
2010-09-09T12:18:54  <jmcarthur> didn't learn a thing there
2010-09-09T12:19:06  <jmcarthur> learned a million times more from my spare time
2010-09-09T12:19:33  <antimatroid1> i was rather lazy pre uni and didn't really know anything (no programming, didn't even do top maths in year 12), then it was like hang on this stuff is actually lots of fun, so I've been playing catch up ever since
2010-09-09T12:20:36  <amstan> hello
2010-09-09T12:20:41  <jmcarthur> hey!
2010-09-09T12:20:58  <antimatroid1> morning sir
2010-09-09T12:21:26  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Dave you written a game simulator in Haskell yet?
2010-09-09T12:22:16  <drewrobb> so was the irc channel active all of last contest? knowing this is here now is going to make me all the more sucked in to the competition
2010-09-09T12:22:23  <mightybyte> Yes, it was.
2010-09-09T12:22:51  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: no, but i will have to do some amount of that just for my bot. it will be an unusual one though. not sure if it would generalize to a full engine or visualizer very well
2010-09-09T12:22:54  <mightybyte> Oh, I don't know how long it was up, but it was up for at least a good portion of the contest.
2010-09-09T12:23:05  <jmcarthur> drewrobb: yeah this was *very* active
2010-09-09T12:23:16  <jmcarthur> almost all of it
2010-09-09T12:23:20  <antimatroid1> it's a huge drain on productivity
2010-09-09T12:23:24  <jmcarthur> yeah :P
2010-09-09T12:23:24  <mightybyte> Yep
2010-09-09T12:23:34  <drewrobb> i really missed out :(
2010-09-09T12:23:37  <jmcarthur> both for the bot and for other stuff
2010-09-09T12:23:44  <mightybyte> Although, it's also a great source of ideas.
2010-09-09T12:23:51  <jmcarthur> it really is
2010-09-09T12:23:56  <antimatroid1> i expect the irc channel is going to explode in about a weeks time
2010-09-09T12:23:58  <drewrobb> at least i'm no longer in school this time, although don't know if that is good or bad
2010-09-09T12:24:01  <jmcarthur> a lot of stuff is discussed here that never makes its way to the forums
2010-09-09T12:24:27  <antimatroid1> drewrobb: I'm currently in the second half of a 150% load semester, with entries closing like right at the end of exams :|

2010-09-09T12:25:46  <mightybyte> Oh, it just dawned on me that the contest runs until the end of November.  Until now I had been assuming it was only going to be two weeks or so.
2010-09-09T12:25:55  <drewrobb> ouch
2010-09-09T12:26:13  <jmcarthur> nope, it's longer than last time
2010-09-09T12:26:22  <jmcarthur> and that makes me happy and sad at the same time
2010-09-09T12:26:36  <antimatroid1> :D
2010-09-09T12:27:09  <jmcarthur> i need to make a word schedule so i can juggle this stuff
2010-09-09T12:27:13  <jmcarthur> *work schedule, even
2010-09-09T12:27:26  <antimatroid1> i can't even handle the concept of a diary
2010-09-09T12:27:31  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-09T12:27:32  <antimatroid1> let alone a set schedule
2010-09-09T12:27:49  <javagamer> In C++ when I call pw.Planets() can I count on the planets being ordered by ID?
2010-09-09T12:28:48  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Yeah, me too.  Looks like I'm not going to accomplish very much else in the next three months.
2010-09-09T12:29:51  <antimatroid1> i can't seem to get people interested at my uni to participate
2010-09-09T12:29:56  <bss03> javagamer: Use the source.  I'm not sure.
2010-09-09T12:30:24  <javagamer> It looks like it, just wanted to confirm before I start relying on it.  I guess I'm confident enough as is
2010-09-09T12:32:55  <Racko> javagamer: The planets are ordered as parsed from the server message (e.g. the map).
2010-09-09T12:34:19  <bss03> javagamer: Which is their id then.  The id seems to be mostly synthetic, it's not in the "P" message.
2010-09-09T12:34:50  <seigen> phreeza: you dev'ing right now?
2010-09-09T12:34:54  <javagamer> Racko, they'll always be ordered the same way, right?
2010-09-09T12:35:34  <javagamer> I want to maintain references to the planets across turns and it's taking me some time setting this up
2010-09-09T12:35:52  <bss03> Is it just me, or do others think that RageBot is written all wrong.
2010-09-09T12:35:53  <Racko> the game specification does not guarantee that planets maintain the same order.
2010-09-09T12:36:09  <bss03> It should just print out "RAGEQUIT!" and exit, ignoring all input.
2010-09-09T12:36:48  <javagamer> lol
2010-09-09T12:37:09  <bss03> javagamer: Track them by position; they shouldn't move or overlap.
2010-09-09T12:37:20  <javagamer> bss03, great idea!
2010-09-09T12:37:52  <bss03> Oh, wait, that's not such a great idea.  I forgot positions are floating point numbers.
2010-09-09T12:38:01  <javagamer> Hmmm....
2010-09-09T12:38:11  <Racko> but it's good enough ;)
2010-09-09T12:38:13  <antimatroid1> think of it will a fully connected graph
2010-09-09T12:38:13  <javagamer> IDs would also be faster if I knew they would stay the same
2010-09-09T12:38:16  <antimatroid1> like*
2010-09-09T12:38:18  <bss03> Comparing floating point for equality does not always give you what you want.
2010-09-09T12:38:18  <antimatroid1> damn it's late
2010-09-09T12:39:03  <bss03> Late?  It's only 11:40 AM! ;)
2010-09-09T12:39:15  <antimatroid1> 2 40am* :P
2010-09-09T12:39:56  <Umsturz> 18:39
2010-09-09T12:40:00  <jmcarthur> one of the biggest problems i've seen so far as has been the lack of a semi-formal specification for the game
2010-09-09T12:40:01  <bss03> Um, are we allowed to put comments in the stuff we send to the server?
2010-09-09T12:40:16  <antimatroid1> yes to comments
2010-09-09T12:40:23  <bss03> The Haskell code seems to support using '#' as a comment-to-end-of-line character.
2010-09-09T12:40:28  <bss03> But, I didn't see that in the rules.
2010-09-09T12:40:44  <antimatroid1> the server is just going to compile your code
2010-09-09T12:40:59  <antimatroid1> the compiler will throw the comments out, same as any other time :P
2010-09-09T12:41:01  <jmcarthur> bss03: the spec says there may be comments
2010-09-09T12:41:03  <bss03> Sorry, I meant the commands the client outputs.
2010-09-09T12:41:33  <jmcarthur> bss03: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/wiki/PlanetWarsFileFormats
2010-09-09T12:41:37  <antimatroid1> you don't really want to :P, output is sloooow
2010-09-09T12:41:47  <bss03> http://www.ai-contest.com/problem_description.php -- doesn't say anything about comments.  Is there a better reference I should be looking at?
2010-09-09T12:42:05  <jmcarthur> bss03: oh you mean from your bot?
2010-09-09T12:42:19  <jmcarthur> bss03: the game state / maps are allowed to have comments. not sure about your bot output
2010-09-09T12:42:30  <Racko> engine.py is a great reference :P
2010-09-09T12:43:59  <bss03> engine.py doesn't allow them.
2010-09-09T12:44:14  <bss03> engine.py says if you don't have exactly 3 space-separated tokens on your line, you faill.
2010-09-09T12:44:45  <jmcarthur> haha
2010-09-09T12:45:11  <drewrobb> woah ELO on dhartmei was just renormalized or something
2010-09-09T12:45:26  <jmcarthur> oh you *are* talking about the client output
2010-09-09T12:45:28  <coventry> In the subversion repository, what are the ssh keys in planet_wars/backend for?
2010-09-09T12:45:30  <jmcarthur> yeah, no comments there i'm sure
2010-09-09T12:45:38  <jmcarthur> coventry: ssh keys? :o
2010-09-09T12:45:40  <bss03> Would be nice to be able to include them and have them in the replay file; for later analysis and stuff.
2010-09-09T12:45:55  <jmcarthur> bss03: yeah, no logging on the server
2010-09-09T12:45:56  <bss03> Maybe document your AI's "thought process".
2010-09-09T12:46:00  <jmcarthur> bss03: that's what the tcp server is good for
2010-09-09T12:46:01  <coventry> jmcarthur: yep, including the private ones.
2010-09-09T12:46:20  <jmcarthur> coventry: :o
2010-09-09T12:46:53  <jmcarthur> @tell j3camero coventry reports that there are ssh keys in planet_wars/backend, including private ones. i'm not sure what's up with that

2010-09-09T12:49:29  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-09-09T12:49:32  <bss03> grep'ing a checkout for vm_id_rsa and jail_id_rsa could give some insight into their importance.

2010-09-09T12:51:18  <jmcarthur> i hope it's at least using kvm for speed
2010-09-09T12:52:07  <bss03> Depends on the set-up, but most modern distributions of QEMU will automatically use /dev/kvm if they can open it.
2010-09-09T12:52:12  <jmcarthur> it doesn't look like kvm is being used...
2010-09-09T12:52:14  <jmcarthur> oh?
2010-09-09T12:52:17  <jmcarthur> i thought it required a flag
2010-09-09T12:53:15  <jmcarthur> amstan: around?
2010-09-09T12:53:37  <jmcarthur> amstan: do you know if the server has kvm? it would probably make the qemu sandboxes much faster
2010-09-09T12:53:48  <bss03> There's a compiler flag for automatically doing it now, IIRC.
2010-09-09T12:53:59  <jmcarthur> amstan: assuming that qemu will automatically use it as bss03 suggests
2010-09-09T12:54:25  <jmcarthur> bss03: what about in the qemu for ubuntu 8.04? it's a bit old...
2010-09-09T12:55:05  <coventry> It looks like there's an iptables command in create_jail_users.py which prevents outgoing packets from the jailed user.
2010-09-09T12:55:07  <bss03> Haven't used Ubuntu 8.04 is quite a while, so I'm not sure.
2010-09-09T12:55:23  <jmcarthur> coventry: ah that's good
2010-09-09T12:55:28  <bss03> Even if it turns out they are already using it, it would be nice to double-check, I think.
2010-09-09T12:55:36  <jmcarthur> coventry: there should also be many system calls blocked
2010-09-09T12:55:45  <jmcarthur> ideally
2010-09-09T12:56:21  <jmcarthur> @ask j3camero does the server have kvm and does the install qemu use it? it would be much faster for the sandboxes than plain qemu
2010-09-09T12:56:21  <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

2010-09-09T13:01:54  <jmcarthur> amstan: you can probably see if kvm is running by doing something like:  lsmod | grep kvm
2010-09-09T13:02:06  <jmcarthur> amstan: that doesn't say whether qemu is actually using it though
2010-09-09T13:02:35  <bss03> lsof /dev/kvm and see if the qemu process(es) are listed.
2010-09-09T13:02:36  <jmcarthur> amstan: old versions of qemu i think require a special build flag for it. would need to do some googling
2010-09-09T13:02:36  <amstan> no lines outputted, so i guess you're out of luck
2010-09-09T13:02:56  <jmcarthur> dang. that means we have an opportunity to speed things up a lot :)
2010-09-09T13:03:25  <jmcarthur> bss03's suggestion is better than mine ;)
2010-09-09T13:03:35  <jmcarthur> but if the kvm module isn't loaded anyway then it won't say anything useful
2010-09-09T13:03:37  <amstan> jmcarthur: ideally, for the next competition we can do a rewrite of everything
2010-09-09T13:03:58  <jmcarthur> amstan: well, fortunately this should not require a rewrite. just some new software installed
2010-09-09T13:04:12  <a1k0n> hm, looks like half the old games on benzedrine.cx are purged
2010-09-09T13:04:14  <amstan> jmcarthur: write a proposal and we'll see
2010-09-09T13:04:17  <jmcarthur> alright
2010-09-09T13:04:34  <amstan> we need to get more organized somehow..
2010-09-09T13:04:43  <amstan> suggestions?
2010-09-09T13:04:48  <phreeza> seigen: i was deving until about an hour ago but have stopped now, cooking
2010-09-09T13:04:59  <a1k0n> it'd help if j3camero took off work today
2010-09-09T13:08:51  <jmcarthur> it's issue 83, for the record

2010-09-09T13:10:01  <amstan> jmcarthur: how do you measure cpu time in that sandbox?
2010-09-09T13:10:35  <mightybyte> amstan: Someone needs to be a benevolent dictator and make decisions on all the key issues.
2010-09-09T13:10:51  <jmcarthur> amstan: you are asking about quantitatively testing for speed increases?
2010-09-09T13:10:55  <amstan> mightybyte: that's j3camero, but it seems like he's pretty busy
2010-09-09T13:11:05  <amstan> jmcarthur: no.. it's for the 1 second time limit
2010-09-09T13:11:30  <mightybyte> That job would also involve aggressive prioritization of issues.
2010-09-09T13:11:33  <jmcarthur> amstan: oh. probably however you would do it outside of the sandbox
2010-09-09T13:11:43  <amstan> ok
2010-09-09T13:12:18  <jmcarthur> amstan: i know that a process can set a SIGALRM on itself for CPU time
2010-09-09T13:12:22  <Zannick> the sadbox
2010-09-09T13:12:58  <jmcarthur> hmm... i wonder if subprocesses also contribute to that cpu time
2010-09-09T13:13:02  <jmcarthur> the probably do
2010-09-09T13:13:41  <jmcarthur> i wonder if we could make the tournament engine launch wrapper processes around the bots that monitor the bots' cpu times by monitoring their own
2010-09-09T13:13:52  <a1k0n> i highly doubt ITIMER_VIRTUAL includes subprocess cpu time
2010-09-09T13:14:06  <jmcarthur> :(
2010-09-09T13:14:24  <javagamer> Is there some hash_map I'm supposed to use in C++?  I included <hash_map>, but am getting deprecated warnings
2010-09-09T13:14:32  <a1k0n> getrusage will tell you subprocess time iirc
2010-09-09T13:14:47  <a1k0n> RUSAGE_CHILDREN
2010-09-09T13:15:09  <a1k0n> javagamer: ext/hash_map and ext::hash_map i believe
2010-09-09T13:16:56  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: that only works for subprocesses that have terminated
2010-09-09T13:17:05  <javagamer> a1k0n, ext looks like the wrong namespace, and either ways I still get the deprecated error :/
2010-09-09T13:19:08  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: oh weird.  sure enough
2010-09-09T13:19:45  <a1k0n> oh __gnu_cxx is the namespace.  barf.
2010-09-09T13:20:45  <javagamer> thanks
2010-09-09T13:22:39  <Palmik> javagamer, or you can try your luck with std::unordered_map I think that newer versions of gcc define it, not sure about vsial studio's compiler
2010-09-09T13:23:17  <javagamer> Will the contest servers have it?
2010-09-09T13:23:19  <phreeza> why is albert gone from the tcp server rankings??
2010-09-09T13:23:28  <javagamer> I'm using GCC
2010-09-09T13:23:44  <Palmik> javagamer, dunno what is the version of gcc... but it's even on versions as old as 4.0 asi i juts found
2010-09-09T13:23:57  <Palmik> *version of the contest server
2010-09-09T13:24:39  <amstan> Palmik, javagamer: gcc version 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4)
2010-09-09T13:24:42  <Palmik> javagamer, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2732543/boostunordered-map-support-by-gcc look here... there is even talk about what a1k0n proposed
2010-09-09T13:24:55  <Palmik> amstan, thanks .)
2010-09-09T13:25:23  <seigen> phreeza: just curious, you seemed to be crashing a lot.
2010-09-09T13:25:46  <phreeza> seigen: ah, yes :)

2010-09-09T13:32:33  <a1k0n> apparently the "suppression field" tactic doesn't work

2010-09-09T13:33:33  <Zannick> hahaha it looked like 13 ships captured a planet of 100 or so
2010-09-09T13:33:36  <antimatroid1> the nuts and bolts are very important, which aren't even properly clarified yet, so it's hard to say what will and wont work :P
2010-09-09T13:33:41  <Zannick> but the arrow was hiding the third digit
2010-09-09T13:34:01  <a1k0n> canvas needs an xor drawing mode or something
2010-09-09T13:34:08  <a1k0n> (maybe it has one)
2010-09-09T13:34:14  <amstan> so.. how's contest bot doing?
2010-09-09T13:34:37  <antimatroid1> is the game engine combining players fleets with same arrival times yet?
2010-09-09T13:35:31  <jmcarthur> now what exactly is intended by that? are you talking about the output from the engine to the client?
2010-09-09T13:35:40  <jmcarthur> because if you are that could really throw some clients off
2010-09-09T13:35:52  <jmcarthur> those which are expecting to see exactly what they said
2010-09-09T13:36:06  <antimatroid1> the information is the same
2010-09-09T13:36:17  <jmcarthur> i'm not necessarily opposed to it
2010-09-09T13:36:23  <Zannick> the game engine has always combined arriving fleets by player
2010-09-09T13:36:25  <jmcarthur> it's just something to consider
2010-09-09T13:36:28  <antimatroid1> otherwise meh, but I'm not not spamming fleets if it's allowed
2010-09-09T13:36:55  <Zannick> it has not yet combined fleets equal in source, dest, and time remaining
2010-09-09T13:37:23  <antimatroid1> it is of my opinion one currently has a stupid advantage in sending fleets of size 1
2010-09-09T13:37:29  <antimatroid1> provided they have the time to send that
2010-09-09T13:38:04  <Zannick> even if a bot issues N 1-ship fleets to the same planet in one turn, it will be better off to think of that as 1 unit of 10
2010-09-09T13:38:08  <Zannick> s/10/N
2010-09-09T13:38:26  <jmcarthur> what advantage?
2010-09-09T13:38:44  <antimatroid1> Zannick: yes, but dependent on how the other bot handles fleets, it could cripple them, otherwise it still increases the time for the other bot to process it
2010-09-09T13:39:05  <jmcarthur> even a marginally intelligent bot will merge fleets on its own
2010-09-09T13:39:14  <icefox> honestly sending lots of 1 fleet slows down the app so it would make sense for the client to want to optimize those away
2010-09-09T13:39:15  <antimatroid1> and if the other bots are beating some people just by crippling them, whereas they might get the luck win on your for not spamming, then you kind of get to the point where everyone spams
2010-09-09T13:39:21  <Zannick> or ignore them completely
2010-09-09T13:39:41  <antimatroid1> that's why i'm saying combine them, and make it irrelevant (just a waste of your time) to send multiple fleets
2010-09-09T13:39:47  <jmcarthur> i'm convinced

2010-09-09T13:40:05  <Zannick> i was planning on working on that later, yes.
2010-09-09T13:40:17  <icefox> What is fun is tricking bots into wasting time on planets that they are far away from
2010-09-09T13:40:40  <antimatroid1> icefox: I think traps will be awesome for this :D
2010-09-09T13:40:45  <jmcarthur> traps?
2010-09-09T13:40:48  <icefox> sure
2010-09-09T13:40:59  <jmcarthur> like set bait and then strike?
2010-09-09T13:41:01  <antimatroid1> try to convince the other player to make a move
2010-09-09T13:41:02  <antimatroid1> that you can counter
2010-09-09T13:41:03  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-09T13:41:06  <icefox> some bots put a higher priority on planets the other side owns
2010-09-09T13:41:08  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-09T13:41:34  <jmcarthur> i don't think exploiting other bots' gullibility is something my bot will do for a while
2010-09-09T13:41:49  <antimatroid1> i tend to just write a bot
2010-09-09T13:41:53  <antimatroid1> then upload and make tweaks
2010-09-09T13:41:55  <antimatroid1> fine tune on paper
2010-09-09T13:42:05  <antimatroid1> rather than incrementally code one, i end up rewriting too much
2010-09-09T13:42:16  <jmcarthur> i'm going to go for solid play first (on unrealistic assumption that my opponent is as smart as i am)
2010-09-09T13:42:24  <jmcarthur> :P
2010-09-09T13:42:29  <antimatroid1> you guys have played galcon a bit i expect?
2010-09-09T13:42:36  <jmcarthur> just a little
2010-09-09T13:42:45  <jmcarthur> i'm not of the opinion that human play resembles bot play enough to be relevant
2010-09-09T13:42:47  <antimatroid1> i got to the point of beating level 10 single player
2010-09-09T13:42:51  <antimatroid1> the special levels still owned me
2010-09-09T13:43:05  <antimatroid1> no, but it was nice to sort of get a feel as to what got me crushed and what didn't
2010-09-09T13:43:24  <icefox> special levels?

2010-09-09T13:43:32  <antimatroid1> there are more levels past 10
2010-09-09T13:44:30  <icefox> How do you guys deal with the first move?  So far I have settled on just not doing anything the first move to see what they other guys strategy is, but it seems like a waste (especially against myself)
2010-09-09T13:45:08  <jmcarthur> i think that is probably a bad idea in general
2010-09-09T13:45:10  <a1k0n>     String playbackString = "";
2010-09-09T13:45:11  <a1k0n>     int ch;
2010-09-09T13:45:11  <a1k0n>     try {
2010-09-09T13:45:11  <a1k0n>       while ((ch = System.in.read()) >= 0) {
2010-09-09T13:45:11  <a1k0n>         playbackString += (char)ch;
2010-09-09T13:45:13  <a1k0n> hahahahahhahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2010-09-09T13:45:23  <jmcarthur> early in the game is when the opponent is least likely to be able to reach you, so you can expand most safely
2010-09-09T13:45:30  <jmcarthur> wow!
2010-09-09T13:45:44  <antimatroid1> icefox: terrible first move
2010-09-09T13:45:53  <jmcarthur> that's absolutely awesome, a1k0n
2010-09-09T13:46:05  <Zannick> jmcarthur: not always the case, sometimes the starter planets are very close to the center
2010-09-09T13:46:05  <a1k0n> that is why showgame takes an hour to load a game
2010-09-09T13:46:05  <jmcarthur> we need to punish j3camero severely for this one
2010-09-09T13:46:09  <antimatroid1> try taking some of the neutral planets closest to you that are most appealing, and maybe contempalte battling for the planets of equal distance that are appealing
2010-09-09T13:46:17  <jmcarthur> Zannick: yeah, least likely, not always
2010-09-09T13:46:54  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't bother with center planets on the first turn, personally
2010-09-09T13:46:59  <drewrobb> oh wow that is some nice code
2010-09-09T13:47:01  <jmcarthur> if would consider it for the *second* turn
2010-09-09T13:47:23  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: might be worth getting closer to them
2010-09-09T13:47:35  <icefox> sending your entire fleet minus 1 to the enemy planet is a pretty destructive first move
2010-09-09T13:47:47  <antimatroid1> yes, nobody suggested that :P
2010-09-09T13:48:19  <jmcarthur> yeah, but if they do it at the same time then a 3-way kills everything off. if you just wait one turn before going for center planets then you might be able to just wipe out a huge force or avoid a huge force at all just because they bothered with nearby planets instead
2010-09-09T13:48:30  <icefox> then you own two 5 planets one far away with 1 fleet and one near the baddies with a bunch
2010-09-09T13:48:42  <Zannick> controlling the center planet is how my bot wins at the moment
2010-09-09T13:48:47  <antimatroid1> that's why i'm saying go for the planets for which you are closer than the enemy
2010-09-09T13:48:55  <jmcarthur> yeah that'd be okay
2010-09-09T13:49:02  <jmcarthur> it still depends though
2010-09-09T13:49:04  <Zannick> but it can only take it if the other bot goes for it first
2010-09-09T13:49:32  <jmcarthur> if the enemy waits for you to make that move first it can send the appropriate number of ships to perfectly wipe yours out. it just slightly more expensive for planets closer to you than them
2010-09-09T13:50:06  <jmcarthur> that growth rate is nice to take advantage of
2010-09-09T13:50:18  <antimatroid1> there are variables involved that change the optimal move there
2010-09-09T13:50:22  <jmcarthur> the longer you are there before the enemy arrives, the more expensive the enemy force must be to win
2010-09-09T13:50:26  <jmcarthur> yeah of course
2010-09-09T13:50:39  <icefox> not a good long term strategy, but a decent one
2010-09-09T13:50:49  <antimatroid1> i want winning strategies
2010-09-09T13:50:52  <antimatroid1> not decent ones :P
2010-09-09T13:51:04  <jmcarthur> i want a decent winning strategy
2010-09-09T13:51:10  <icefox> start moves, vs mid and end game

2010-09-09T13:52:01  <jmcarthur> wat

2010-09-09T13:54:27  <Zannick> antimatroid1: have you seen my bot?
2010-09-09T13:54:29  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: are all maps guaranteed to be symmetrical?
2010-09-09T13:54:40  <Zannick> jmcarthur: yep
2010-09-09T13:54:46  <jmcarthur> ah, that's nice
2010-09-09T13:54:52  <antimatroid1> kind of has to be
2010-09-09T13:55:00  <Zannick> planet id 0 is always the center
2010-09-09T13:55:03  <jmcarthur> well, to be fair, sure, but that doesn't mean it's the case :P
2010-09-09T13:55:06  <antimatroid1> Zannick: I haven't

2010-09-09T13:57:37  <antimatroid1> wasn't that you who posted in the forums saying turn lengths should depend on language used?
2010-09-09T13:57:38  <Umsturz> Zannick: If planet id 0 is the center what is 1?
2010-09-09T13:58:11  <Zannick> antimatroid1: no.
2010-09-09T13:58:26  <seigen> i think i might be happy with it, now.

2010-09-09T14:02:38  <antimatroid1> meh, i have to scan through the planets when I set up anyway
2010-09-09T14:03:37  <antimatroid1> have we considered generating a variety of challenging maps to get right strategically, or just so it offers a lot of variety?
2010-09-09T14:04:11  <antimatroid1> like integer grid games would be kind of weird, or lots of large growth planets, etc.
2010-09-09T14:04:50  <jmcarthur> yeah i'm curious about non-random maps, myself
2010-09-09T14:04:55  <amstan> jmcarthur: there.. i made it remember most of the stuff:
2010-09-09T14:05:05  <amstan> `where tcpserver
2010-09-09T14:05:19  <amstan> contestbot: where tcpserver
2010-09-09T14:05:20  <contestbot> amstan: tcpserver could be http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/.
2010-09-09T14:05:29  <amstan> hmm.. stupid char
2010-09-09T14:05:39  <antimatroid1> the distances with lattice games are weird though
2010-09-09T14:05:43  <antimatroid1> with the way it's defined
2010-09-09T14:05:45  <antimatroid1> i think?
2010-09-09T14:06:04  <jmcarthur> i think lots of planets near each player but a huge gap between them might be interesting
2010-09-09T14:06:15  <jmcarthur> since it would give bots a lot of time to prepare for a strike
2010-09-09T14:06:32  <Umsturz> there is a map thats like that
2010-09-09T14:06:35  <antimatroid1> i will try to generate some maps over the weekend that might provide various avenues for achieving the best result
2010-09-09T14:06:47  <antimatroid1> (it's friday morning here already)
2010-09-09T14:07:24  <jmcarthur> a big circle could be fun
2010-09-09T14:07:37  <jmcarthur> maybe with a single high yield planet in the middle
2010-09-09T14:07:49  <jmcarthur> equidistance from all other planets
2010-09-09T14:08:00  <jmcarthur> *equidistant

2010-09-09T14:09:28  <antimatroid1> what about a cirlce, with a high growth point in the circle, but not in the centre, just equally spaced from the two players starting position
2010-09-09T14:09:43  <amstan> contestbot: later tell dhartmei the link to the forums on this page is broken(http://www.benzedrine.cx/tron/), use ai-contest.com/forums it should work
2010-09-09T14:09:43  <contestbot> amstan: The operation succeeded.
2010-09-09T14:09:55  <jmcarthur> god java is so enterprisy
2010-09-09T14:10:19  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: that could be neat too
2010-09-09T14:10:40  <a1k0n> CodeReviewIssueTrackingManager codereviewissuetrackingmanager = new CodeReviewIssueTrackingManager()
2010-09-09T14:10:56  <jmcarthur> another idea: a straight line of planets with players starting at the ends
2010-09-09T14:11:02  <seigen> bahahah
2010-09-09T14:11:05  <jmcarthur> boring to watch maybe
2010-09-09T14:11:14  <jmcarthur> but maybe some interesting strategies
2010-09-09T14:11:15  <seigen> a1k0n: i'm so glad i don't program in Java anymore.
2010-09-09T14:11:15  <antimatroid1> yeah okay, i think there needs to be a set of novelty maps
2010-09-09T14:11:24  <antimatroid1> and perhaps put the more interesting ones in the final tournament
2010-09-09T14:11:27  <amstan> a goatse map
2010-09-09T14:11:34  <jmcarthur> novelty maps at the least might be easier to analyze for strategy ideas
2010-09-09T14:11:41  <a1k0n> i'm going to start using java pretty soon so i can hadoop up some shit
2010-09-09T14:11:52  <seigen> ugh
2010-09-09T14:11:59  <antimatroid1> if I never touch java again my life will be alright
2010-09-09T14:12:09  <seigen> i hate to say this, but i think javascript has passed java.

2010-09-09T14:12:40  <jmcarthur> both have advanced
2010-09-09T14:12:51  <jmcarthur> java has always been at least this bad :P
2010-09-09T14:13:06  <jmcarthur> and javascript actually has almost nothing to do with java
2010-09-09T14:14:36  <a1k0n> awesome if there's a tie the fucking java engine gives it to player 2
2010-09-09T14:15:21  <jmcarthur> ...
2010-09-09T14:15:52  <a1k0n> (not always, there seems to be a subtle fleet account bug)

2010-09-09T14:23:05  <antimatroid1> 2 fleets?
2010-09-09T14:23:20  <a1k0n> there are like 50 fleets so it'd hard to keep track
2010-09-09T14:23:40  <antimatroid1> yeah, but there could be two of the "same" fleet that appears to just be one
2010-09-09T14:23:50  <antimatroid1> i know the original viewer did that when I tried it
2010-09-09T14:24:11  <antimatroid1> i really need to make up my mind about whether I can be bothered shifting 'i's

2010-09-09T14:26:07  <javagamer> Think I've got it working now
2010-09-09T14:29:58  <a1k0n> this is definitely a tie
2010-09-09T14:31:34  <seigen> a1k0n: i've had a few ties.  it's weird.
2010-09-09T14:31:45  <a1k0n> but the java engine is saying player 2 won
2010-09-09T14:31:53  <a1k0n> i just parsed out the game state by hand, and no way
2010-09-09T14:32:26  <a1k0n> i'm running my bot against itself and player 2 always wins
2010-09-09T14:33:23  <a1k0n> ugh the input from clients is also quadratic
2010-09-09T14:33:28  <javagamer> Does the java engine support ties?
2010-09-09T14:33:32  <a1k0n> it does
2010-09-09T14:33:41  <a1k0n> i've had it happen, i just can't tell what's wrong here
2010-09-09T14:35:24  <antimatroid1> i might see if i can generate some random maps tomorrow that meet other symmetries as well
2010-09-09T14:37:12  <antimatroid1> i think we can generate fair symmetric maps that aren't always symmetric about the line "separating" the two players
2010-09-09T14:37:22  <antimatroid1> i think that'd be a decent idea for generating contest maps
2010-09-09T14:38:36  <antimatroid1> just pick any random line through the centre point of the line joining them, and have the planets be symmetric across that

2010-09-09T14:41:40  <antimatroid1> toss up the way in which the planets are then id'd, and players wouldn't necessarily be able to just "assume" symmetry so easily
2010-09-09T14:43:10  <jmcarthur> i don't see how assuming symmetry is even all that helpful

2010-09-09T15:47:06  <jmcarthur> amstan: lambdabot is used in lots and lots of channels. changing things would be counterproductive for a lot of people. if you wanted to run your own lambdabot server it could be okay i guess
2010-09-09T15:47:20  <jmcarthur> this specific instance of lambdabot i mean
2010-09-09T15:47:32  <jmcarthur> if you want the source you can get it from here:
2010-09-09T15:47:34  <jmcarthur> @where lambdabot
2010-09-09T15:47:34  <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html
2010-09-09T15:47:49  <javagamer> Hmm... this looks pretty boost specific.  Oh well, I can just switch to using boost
2010-09-09T15:47:50  <amstan> jmcarthur: contestbot now does very similar things
2010-09-09T15:48:10  <jmcarthur> amstan: are you wanting contestbot to have the @ syntax?
2010-09-09T15:48:16  <amstan> yeah

2010-09-09T15:49:38  <jmcarthur> well, won't be mentioned anyway
2010-09-09T15:49:53  <jmcarthur> they are probably still stored if i ever bring lambdabot back
2010-09-09T15:50:14  <Palmik> hmm, so only one instance is powering whole freenode, nice :P
2010-09-09T15:50:24  <amstan> jmcarthur: @later tell nick message
2010-09-09T15:50:26  <Palmik> how do you make him join specific channel? :)
2010-09-09T15:50:32  <jmcarthur> well, there are more instances, but that nick is all just one instance in all channels you see it in
2010-09-09T15:50:41  <jmcarthur> amstan: i know, but i don't remember all of them now :P
2010-09-09T15:51:10  <jmcarthur> Palmik: that's something you can only do if you are authenticated to do it
2010-09-09T15:51:18  <Palmik> I see :D
2010-09-09T15:51:37  <jmcarthur> i actually have a dirty trick to do it. i was never actually given the privs
2010-09-09T15:51:42  <jmcarthur> but i shouldn't spread it around
2010-09-09T15:52:10  <jmcarthur> lamdabot is not a particularly secure bot :\
2010-09-09T15:52:10  <Palmik> No problem, I understand that :)
2010-09-09T15:52:57  <jmcarthur> wow, lambdabot is only in three channels right now!
2010-09-09T15:53:05  <jmcarthur> i guess a lot of people are running their own instances now
2010-09-09T15:53:17  <jmcarthur> it used to be that she was in like 20 or so channels
2010-09-09T15:53:25  <jmcarthur> including oddball ones like #perl
2010-09-09T15:53:45  <jmcarthur> (presumably due to pugs i guess)

2010-09-09T15:56:53  <jmcarthur> wait, so if a planet is occupied by a player (not neutral) and the other player zeros the ships out, who owns it?

2010-09-09T15:57:38  <dhartmei> i was running it when there were <2 players, it's not needed anymore :)
2010-09-09T15:57:56  <dhartmei> amstan: i fixed the forums link in the tron page, thanks
2010-09-09T15:58:02  <jmcarthur> 1R vs. 1G vs. 0N  ==>  ?
2010-09-09T15:58:03  <Palmik> jmcarthur, the previous player
2010-09-09T15:58:06  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-09T15:58:16  <Palmik> I asked this question and this answers is what I was iven :)
2010-09-09T15:58:19  <jmcarthur> okay, so i can't just use the 3-way code for all cases
2010-09-09T15:58:21  <Palmik> *given
2010-09-09T16:00:06  <a1k0n> hmm the visualizer on benzedrine.cx is missing the player legend now
2010-09-09T16:01:13  <icefox> Just noticed that plants with 0 that get sent 1 ship stay at 0 when the 1 ship arrives
2010-09-09T16:02:49  <dhartmei> let me check the 1.2 html
2010-09-09T16:03:31  <amstan> contestbot: where repo
2010-09-09T16:03:31  <contestbot> amstan: repo could be http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/.
2010-09-09T16:04:04  <jmcarthur> icefox: that's weird
2010-09-09T16:04:24  <jmcarthur> icefox: who owns the planet immediately before the ship arrives?
2010-09-09T16:04:31  <icefox> no one
2010-09-09T16:04:37  <jmcarthur> icefox: so it's neutral?
2010-09-09T16:04:41  <icefox> yup
2010-09-09T16:04:45  <jmcarthur> okay, that is weird
2010-09-09T16:04:56  <jmcarthur> i was going to blame growth if a player had owned it
2010-09-09T16:06:08  <dhartmei> a1k0n: fixed
2010-09-09T16:09:07  <jmcarthur> oh wait, i *can* use the 3-way generically
2010-09-09T16:09:29  <amstan> anyone against having a separate #aichallenge-dev channel?
2010-09-09T16:09:30  <jmcarthur> i just have to make it always default to the previous owner if it breaks even, whether neutral or not
2010-09-09T16:09:49  <jmcarthur> i'd rather it be in one place, personally
2010-09-09T16:09:56  <jmcarthur> people will be reporting bugs here a lot anyway
2010-09-09T16:10:05  <jmcarthur> and discussing them, hence
2010-09-09T16:10:16  <amstan> jmcarthur: ok, related: would it be a bad idea to advertise this room on the main page?
2010-09-09T16:10:24  <jmcarthur> not at all, IMO
2010-09-09T16:10:30  <amstan> ok
2010-09-09T16:10:52  <jmcarthur> i am used to very large channels, myself

2010-09-09T17:01:16  <javagamer> Can I have an #if in a #define ?
2010-09-09T17:03:10  <jmcarthur> you should be able to
2010-09-09T17:03:42  <Zannick> you'd probably want to use the #define in a #if #else block
2010-09-09T17:03:56  <jmcarthur> agreed
2010-09-09T17:06:22  <javagamer> I considered that and am pretty sure it wouldn't work, though what I'm trying to do is rather unnecessary
2010-09-09T17:07:40  <Zannick> ??
2010-09-09T17:08:06  <javagamer> I'll pastebin the code once I get it working
2010-09-09T17:11:22  <javagamer> Actually, this really isn't worth it.

2010-09-09T17:16:30  <javagamer> I was just trying to avoid some if statements in my debugging code.  I have it log something only if the debugging level is over some constant for each message and I was trying to use #if s to comment out he line if the debugging level was too low.
2010-09-09T17:17:59  <Zannick> yeah for debugging i do something like #if DEBUG #define debug(...) <stuff> #else #define debug(...) #endif
2010-09-09T17:18:43  <Zannick> the else case defines the debug statement as empty so it's removed everywhere in the code
2010-09-09T17:18:44  <jmcarthur> i don't do log levels. not much point, for me
2010-09-09T17:18:51  <jmcarthur> s/for me/to me/
2010-09-09T17:19:31  <Zannick> i've used a set of bit flags
2010-09-09T17:20:27  <ulope> jmcarthur: I guess that depends how you use logging. my current bot spews out about 20-50 lines per planet per turn if i run it on DEBUG, so obviously i usually use INFO
2010-09-09T17:21:06  <jmcarthur> i rarely do logging at all, actually
2010-09-09T17:21:27  <jmcarthur> i will add traces here and there if i hit a problem, and then remove them promptly after
2010-09-09T17:22:19  <javagamer> Right now I have 2-3 lines per planet per turn
2010-09-09T17:22:37  <javagamer> I just know I'll run into problem later and want to use the debugging code I wrote, so I'm keeping it in
2010-09-09T17:22:58  <Cyndre> dont unocupied planets increase in pop?

2010-09-09T17:24:07  <Cyndre> cool
2010-09-09T17:24:08  <jmcarthur> if you ask nicely you could possible get in later

2010-09-09T17:24:23  <Cyndre> nah, havent even started yet
2010-09-09T17:24:29  <Cyndre> been sick home from work since tuesday
2010-09-09T17:24:30  <Cyndre> :(
2010-09-09T17:24:32  <jmcarthur> aw
2010-09-09T17:24:36  <jmcarthur> at least you have a job :(
2010-09-09T17:24:55  <Cyndre> remember how I was writting software last year for monitoring cable modems?
2010-09-09T17:25:03  <jmcarthur> nope
2010-09-09T17:25:04  <jmcarthur> :P
2010-09-09T17:25:10  <Cyndre> hmmm - well I was :)
2010-09-09T17:25:33  <Cyndre> and did a presentation last week and nailed it

2010-09-09T17:27:38  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-09T17:27:48  <jmcarthur> in fact, work made me unable to finish my bot in time :\
2010-09-09T17:28:07  <Cyndre> so then what happened?
2010-09-09T17:28:17  <jmcarthur> i could have probably been around, i figure, 30-50th place, but i ended up in 105th instead
2010-09-09T17:28:20  <jmcarthur> oh, i got laid off
2010-09-09T17:28:25  <Cyndre> that was better then me
2010-09-09T17:28:34  <jmcarthur> there's actually some corporate politics and stuff involved
2010-09-09T17:28:37  <jmcarthur> it all kind of sucks
2010-09-09T17:28:48  <Cyndre> that sucks - did some incompetent boob that would have placed 1k+ get to keep his job?
2010-09-09T17:29:11  <jmcarthur> i didn't really work with any incompetent boobs at least
2010-09-09T17:29:12  <Cyndre> thats the problem is the real smart people dont waste time on politics and ass kissing
2010-09-09T17:29:17  <jmcarthur> it was a bunch of smart people
2010-09-09T17:29:19  <Cyndre> thats a good thing :)
2010-09-09T17:30:21  <Cyndre> so what did you do then before?
2010-09-09T17:30:34  <jmcarthur> antitamper software
2010-09-09T17:30:39  <jmcarthur> mostly kernel programming
2010-09-09T17:30:58  <jmcarthur> kind of a boring job actually, but the workplace was great
2010-09-09T17:30:58  <Cyndre> and no luck in job search?  and how longs it been?
2010-09-09T17:31:37  <Cyndre> I see a1k0n is still at yahoo regardeless of his parpicitation in the google ai contest
2010-09-09T17:31:43  <jmcarthur> i've been searching for a bit over a month now. i have a fair bit of money saved up, so can afford to be picky (and have been picky!) for now
2010-09-09T17:31:57  <Cyndre> nice, what kind of job are you looking for?
2010-09-09T17:32:02  <jmcarthur> yeah he got a lot of offers but instead just moved to a better position within his company
2010-09-09T17:32:25  <Cyndre> oooo so it actually paid off to spend his free time on it :) grats if your listening in a1k0n
2010-09-09T17:32:28  <jmcarthur> i'm been on the hunt for functional programming jobs. have had an interview and a few prospects so far, but nothing solic
2010-09-09T17:32:30  <jmcarthur> *solid
2010-09-09T17:32:51  <jmcarthur> a1k0n actually phrased it as "literally changed his life"
2010-09-09T17:33:18  <Cyndre> grats man - and persoanlly I would rather be in your position then mine right now - currently sysadmin/market/phone support for isp/writting my software that will take me out of that hell hole
2010-09-09T17:33:22  <Cyndre> wow
2010-09-09T17:33:27  <jmcarthur> the company i interviewed with seemed nice, but i think i don't really want to be in finance...
2010-09-09T17:33:55  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: probably because a contest like that takes the politics out of it and leaves little to doubt
2010-09-09T17:34:00  <jmcarthur> currently i'm taking a brief hiatus from the job hunt to try my hand and making some money from a web app i'm working on
2010-09-09T17:34:14  <jmcarthur> but then this contest resurfaced...
2010-09-09T17:34:16  <Cyndre> cool - live yet, or sharring info about it?
2010-09-09T17:34:21  <jmcarthur> nah

2010-09-09T17:35:23  <a1k0n> i had a really really tempting offer from goldman sachs, and everyone seemed really cool and super smart
2010-09-09T17:35:28  <jmcarthur> even then i'm not sure. there are a lot of smart people around :)
2010-09-09T17:35:33  <a1k0n> but i also don't really want to be in finance.  per se.
2010-09-09T17:35:34  <Cyndre> a1k0n, so litterly changed your life?  I am so happy to hear that for you
2010-09-09T17:35:45  <a1k0n> Cyndre: yep.  moved to the bay area.
2010-09-09T17:35:47  <a1k0n> a month ago.
2010-09-09T17:35:50  <Cyndre> cool
2010-09-09T17:36:02  <Cyndre> yet again congrats
2010-09-09T17:36:03  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: yeah, there are nice jobs in finance, but my inhibitions are more... ethical
2010-09-09T17:36:05  <a1k0n> just getting into my new job, doing some cool antispam algorithms...
2010-09-09T17:36:08  <Cyndre> a1k0n
2010-09-09T17:36:14  <jmcarthur> i don't feel right making money out of "thin air"
2010-09-09T17:36:22  <Cyndre> you won the last contest right?
2010-09-09T17:36:28  <jmcarthur> lol, i read that as "antispasm algorithms"
2010-09-09T17:36:32  <a1k0n> and then the contest came along again and consumed my subconscious mind which was previously working on the problem for my job
2010-09-09T17:36:42  <a1k0n> Cyndre: yep
2010-09-09T17:37:12  <Cyndre> make sure to explain to them until you win this contest you can not fully be focused on the antispam algorithms and they should allow you to work on it durring normal hours
2010-09-09T17:37:51  <a1k0n> heh!  my boss is totally understanding, and he's trying to get some of my coworkers to enter
2010-09-09T17:37:52  <jmcarthur> i love the irony of something that was distracting you so much from you job got you better placement at said job
2010-09-09T17:38:19  <Zannick> i told my manager about the contest yesterday
2010-09-09T17:38:23  <a1k0n> i work with a bunch of machine learning dudes
2010-09-09T17:38:29  <Zannick> and about how i was doing all sorts of bugfixing in my free time

2010-09-09T17:41:34  <javagamer> Wow, I just realized I C++'s built-in sort isn't adaptive :/
2010-09-09T17:42:08  <jmcarthur> i'm amused that javagamer isn't not using java, but then again i feel like this is deja vu
2010-09-09T17:42:11  <jmcarthur> *is not
2010-09-09T17:42:54  <javagamer> Yeah, I did C++ last time too, the name is only b/c java was the first real language I learned
2010-09-09T17:43:05  <jmcarthur> java is not a real language
2010-09-09T17:43:17  <javagamer> Thought you might say that
2010-09-09T17:43:20  <jmcarthur> nobody speaks it in the wild
2010-09-09T17:43:30  <jmcarthur> it's synthetic
2010-09-09T17:43:50  <jmcarthur> (ah but you thought i was going to contrast it with haskell, didn't you! thought you had me figured out!)
2010-09-09T17:44:14  <a1k0n> i'm speaking java: Haskell haskell = new Haskell()
2010-09-09T17:44:18  <a1k0n> ok, i'll stop
2010-09-09T17:44:21  <jmcarthur> gibberish
2010-09-09T17:44:25  <javagamer> heh
2010-09-09T17:44:43  <javagamer> C++ doesn't have a built-in adaptive sort, right?
2010-09-09T17:44:55  <jmcarthur> it doesn't have much built in at all
2010-09-09T17:45:00  <a1k0n> what like qsort?  sort in <algorithm>?
2010-09-09T17:45:09  <javagamer> Yeah
2010-09-09T17:45:26  <javagamer> I think I'll probably just use insertion sort, it should work well enough
2010-09-09T17:45:36  <a1k0n> those are built in
2010-09-09T17:45:49  <a1k0n> i maen, depending on what you're sorting you are probably well-served with qsort
2010-09-09T17:45:54  <javagamer> I know it has qsort and sort, but neither are adaptive
2010-09-09T17:45:57  <a1k0n> adaptive how?
2010-09-09T17:46:08  <a1k0n> oh, like working well on pre-sorted stuff
2010-09-09T17:46:11  <ulope> inverselimit: yes, should be
2010-09-09T17:46:15  <javagamer> Yeah
2010-09-09T17:46:38  <javagamer> Not sure how accurate of a benchmark this is, but it seems to make a good case for insertion sort http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/nearly-sorted-initial-order
2010-09-09T17:46:43  <inverselimit> ulope: excellent, thank you
2010-09-09T17:46:47  <Utkarsh> is there any limit on the number of turns for a game?
2010-09-09T17:46:50  <a1k0n> C90 defines heapsort, mergesort, and qsort
2010-09-09T17:47:00  <javagamer> Which doesn't happen to be very difficult to add

2010-09-09T18:16:15  <Scrap> does anybody know, if there will be multiple orders  with the same source and destination, they would be summed up or overwritten?
2010-09-09T18:16:38  <bss03> javagamer: Mergesort is almost as fast on nearly sorted items.
2010-09-09T18:16:55  <bss03> javagamer: Insertion sort is horrible on reverse sorted items.
2010-09-09T18:17:37  <ulope> Scrap: no, there has been some discussion about merging them but it's not happening right now
2010-09-09T18:18:06  <ulope> bss03: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort
2010-09-09T18:18:30  <Scrap> ulope: thanks. That's sad..
2010-09-09T18:19:12  <a1k0n> heh i just commented about that on the forum
2010-09-09T18:19:20  <a1k0n> it does not now, but it probably wouldn't be hard to write a patch
2010-09-09T18:19:55  <a1k0n> same source, destination, and number of turns
2010-09-09T18:20:21  <Zannick> i've been thinking about writing such a patch
2010-09-09T18:20:42  <ratatata> since it doesn't make any difference in terms of battle.. merging should be the way to go, especially with a time limit for clients in place
2010-09-09T18:20:45  <a1k0n> you could also just merge them on input in your client and not care if it's inefficient for others
2010-09-09T18:20:48  <ulope> a1k0n: number of turns doesn't matter just same src & dst in the same turn
2010-09-09T18:21:09  <a1k0n> well, right, number of turns to destination, not from source
2010-09-09T18:21:14  <jmcarthur> i was originally against merging because it could be confusing for clients to see a different state than they put out, but i have since been convinced otherwise
2010-09-09T18:21:17  <a1k0n> er
2010-09-09T18:21:20  <a1k0n> whatever, it's equivalent
2010-09-09T18:21:34  <a1k0n> that's what i meant anyway :)
2010-09-09T18:21:42  <bss03> ulope: I like that Timsort.

2010-09-09T18:22:16  <ulope> Of course they are only equivalent if the battle resolution stuff gets cleaned up
2010-09-09T18:22:18  <bss03> ulope: I'm sure it's implemented to be worst-case n log n anyway.
2010-09-09T18:22:22  <jmcarthur> mergesort also has a better worst-case than quicksort, but in practice quicksort implementations can make worst-case extremely rare
2010-09-09T18:22:29  <a1k0n> ulope: true!
2010-09-09T18:22:58  <jmcarthur> s/if/when/
2010-09-09T18:23:07  <jmcarthur> it better get cleaned up
2010-09-09T18:23:29  <ulope> bss03: there was a comparison with some huge datasets somwhere a few weeks ago where timsort compared very favorably
2010-09-09T18:24:01  <ulope> jmcarthur: true
2010-09-09T18:24:09  <jmcarthur> for visual purposes, the source of a fleet is still significant
2010-09-09T18:24:55  <jmcarthur> i would hate to have two fleets from opposite sides of the map merge just because they will arrive at the same target in the middle of the map at the same time
2010-09-09T18:25:04  <jmcarthur> in a visual, i mean
2010-09-09T18:25:06  <a1k0n> i hope j3camero has time to review/commit on all these issues tonight and can put out new starter packs
2010-09-09T18:25:52  <Zannick> ooh, there should be a "last updated" note on the starter packages page
2010-09-09T18:25:57  <ulope> jmcarthur: I would think that only fleet with the same src/dst get merged
2010-09-09T18:25:58  <a1k0n> i feel like he'll be overwhelmed
2010-09-09T18:28:11  <Scrap> ulope: exactly like that. would be great..

2010-09-09T18:33:08  <a1k0n> i haven't looked at the schema at all
2010-09-09T18:33:19  <Zannick> er, maybe
2010-09-09T18:33:30  <Zannick> i'd have to look at the sql commands that generate the rankings page
2010-09-09T18:33:50  <a1k0n> it's joiney
2010-09-09T18:33:54  <Zannick> but it should be just select elo from rankings where userid=x

2010-09-09T18:35:38  <ulope> seigen: me, but i feel i've run into a bit of a dead end
2010-09-09T18:35:47  <bss03> Is is bad for my AI to run monkey sort of the list of planets when deciding where to go? ;)
2010-09-09T18:36:23  <a1k0n> i'm sure it wins to many existing strategies
2010-09-09T18:38:22  <a1k0n> select score from rankings where username=x
2010-09-09T18:38:52  <Zannick> the problem is the rankings table contains many old rankings
2010-09-09T18:38:55  <Mathnerd314> a1k0n: why do people keep saying random SQL queries?
2010-09-09T18:39:20  <a1k0n> oh so you have to find the rankings for the current submission?
2010-09-09T18:39:40  <Zannick> ooh, current submission, yeah.
2010-09-09T18:39:41  <a1k0n> Mathnerd314: trying to figure out how to put opponents' elo score on the profile game lists
2010-09-09T18:39:45  <Zannick> i was thinking just by username
2010-09-09T18:40:25  <Zannick> well, submission id, that could have old values or nothing...
2010-09-09T18:40:32  <Zannick> er. hm.
2010-09-09T18:40:40  <seigen> ulope: what kind of dead end?
2010-09-09T18:41:01  <Zannick> if it isn't the current submission, leave opp. elo blank?
2010-09-09T18:41:05  <a1k0n> okay this schema is crazy

2010-09-09T18:44:10  <seigen> i may be in the minority here, but i think there may be a straightforward & provably best economic strategy.  NPV of discounted future ship production, or something
2010-09-09T18:44:18  <ulope> seigen: A bit but so far it's not working too well, very many things can happen during a 10 or 20 turn flight
2010-09-09T18:44:39  <Cyndre> add it to the game trackig - the elhoo f each player as the game starts
2010-09-09T18:44:57  <Cyndre> 2 more columns in the table
2010-09-09T18:45:54  <ulope> seigen: hm.. thats somethin to think about
2010-09-09T18:46:57  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: perhaps it should be the most recent elo of that particular submission rather than at the time of the match (but where it freezes when the opponent uploads a new bot, of course)
2010-09-09T18:47:52  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: thats why I would store it at time of game start - then you see the elho of the bot you fought, not the current bot
2010-09-09T18:48:15  <Cyndre> oh
2010-09-09T18:48:38  <Zannick> the elo of the bot you fought is probably still available if the user uploads a new bot
2010-09-09T18:48:40  <Cyndre> maybe like a submissionId tied to the playerId with unique elhos
2010-09-09T18:48:43  <Cyndre> elo
2010-09-09T18:49:05  <Zannick> but it probably won't have the elo that it had at the time
2010-09-09T18:49:16  <Zannick> besides, elo is not updated game-by-game
2010-09-09T18:49:45  <Zannick> and submission ids are tied to player ids
2010-09-09T18:50:29  <Cyndre> so store the submission id at the time of game start, then select elo based on submission id
2010-09-09T18:50:35  <Cyndre> which is probably already done
2010-09-09T18:50:52  <Zannick> yeah, games are recorded as submission id vs submission id
2010-09-09T18:51:21  <a1k0n> yeah but unfortunately elo score is calculated afterward
2010-09-09T18:51:40  <a1k0n> we need a submission id -> elo score table and i think elo is only stored per user
2010-09-09T18:51:49  <a1k0n> but actually
2010-09-09T18:51:54  <a1k0n> if you resubmit all your games disappear anyway
2010-09-09T18:52:21  <a1k0n> so it's still accurate to use the player ranking in the game table
2010-09-09T18:53:07  <Zannick> a1k0n: look at backend/process_ratings.py
2010-09-09T18:53:29  <a1k0n> i just had three games in a row with galcon
2010-09-09T18:53:38  <Zannick> the actual table only puts submission id, not user id
2010-09-09T18:53:45  <a1k0n> oh huh
2010-09-09T18:55:38  <Mathnerd314> danielvf: you around?
2010-09-09T18:56:06  <a1k0n> well that's perfect
2010-09-09T18:56:22  <jmcarthur> another proposal related to rank: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=89
2010-09-09T18:57:57  <a1k0n> wow they use 3 stddevs?
2010-09-09T18:58:04  <a1k0n> that would be invariably negative with bayeselo
2010-09-09T18:58:41  <jmcarthur> are you sure?
2010-09-09T18:58:42  <a1k0n> i think if we just used mean - the '-' that'd be ok; it'd give a bonus to having played more games
2010-09-09T18:58:53  <a1k0n> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getratings
2010-09-09T18:59:03  <a1k0n> you have to play a lot of games for those + and - to converge
2010-09-09T18:59:16  <jmcarthur> + and - are the stddev, are they?
2010-09-09T18:59:18  <jmcarthur> *aren't
2010-09-09T18:59:26  <jmcarthur> i thought they were 95% confidence interval
2010-09-09T18:59:30  <jmcarthur> which is different
2010-09-09T18:59:36  <a1k0n> i guess they're the con.. yeah, so what is that, 3 stddevs already?

2010-09-09T19:01:36  <a1k0n> i wonder what the confidence interval was on the top 10 last time
2010-09-09T19:01:50  <jmcarthur> we were never told, afaik
2010-09-09T19:01:57  <a1k0n> yeah, and i probably don't want to know
2010-09-09T19:02:03  <jmcarthur> it would be nice to know that they were not overlapping
2010-09-09T19:02:15  <a1k0n> i think that is unlikely
2010-09-09T19:02:32  <jmcarthur> it can always be made so by playing enough matches
2010-09-09T19:02:55  <a1k0n> yeah.  but i doubt there were the 500 matches or so necessary to get a +/- 20
2010-09-09T19:03:03  * jmcarthur shrugs
2010-09-09T19:04:51  <jmcarthur> i do believe that bayeselo can also report a true stddev
2010-09-09T19:05:09  <jmcarthur> at least some sample output here shows stddev http://remi.coulom.free.fr/Bayesian-Elo/

2010-09-09T19:34:42  <ulope> Zaphus: someone posted a java version in the forum thread

2010-09-09T19:36:06  <JensTi> you could make it work over irc

2010-09-09T19:53:30  <JensTi> since there's a script to make 100 maps and add them to the db

2010-09-09T19:55:11  <ulope> Yeah. well FF 3.0 is quite ancient

2010-09-09T19:56:41  <ulope> Nah if it weren't for firebug I wouldn't touch firefox anymore at all. Chromium is the new cool kid
2010-09-09T19:56:46  <danielvf> Mathnerd314: Hiya
2010-09-09T19:56:58  <bss03> I perfer to use Debian Stable, fewer bugs that way.
2010-09-09T19:57:13  <ulope> bss03: but fewer features also...
2010-09-09T19:57:19  <bss03> I'm running some stuff out of testing now though, since the next release has been frozen.
2010-09-09T19:57:43  <bss03> ulope: I would rather my computer work consistently.
2010-09-09T19:57:45  <ratatata> I just tried canvas visualizer on laptop, and its too big vertically imo
2010-09-09T19:57:54  <bss03> ulope: Crashes irk me.
2010-09-09T19:58:32  <bss03> ulope: Lack of features doesn't -- I think far too many "new features" are poorly though-out and don't work well.
2010-09-09T19:58:57  <Mathnerd314> danielvf: hi. so, I was playing with the visualizer, and noticed that keyboard step back/forward seems to lag
2010-09-09T19:59:16  <danielvf> Lag?
2010-09-09T19:59:20  <amstan> ulope: actually.. the element inspector in chromium is pretty up to par on the features
2010-09-09T19:59:52  <ulope> bss03: well to each his own but I wouldn't want to be stuck in the glacial release speed of debian
2010-09-09T19:59:59  <Mathnerd314> danielvf: yeah, like I hold down the arrow, and when I release it the visualization keeps moving
2010-09-09T20:00:33  <danielvf> Lol, let me try that
2010-09-09T20:00:41  <bss03> ulope: It's not glacial.  It's (on average) more often than Ubuntu LTS releases.
2010-09-09T20:01:10  <ulope> amstan: Yeah I know but it still has enough rough edges to drive me nuts in no time (e.g. editing css rules in the elements inspector is a major pain)
2010-09-09T20:01:17  <bss03> ulope: And the release is supported about as long as an enterprise distribution.
2010-09-09T20:01:27  <ulope> bss03: Well I wouldn't use LTS for anything else than a server
2010-09-09T20:02:04  <bss03> ulope: I value the same things in a dekstop I value in a server.  Reliability.
2010-09-09T20:02:17  <danielvf> Mathnerd314: you are using the version here? http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284076768|ademar|drewrobb0.1

2010-09-09T20:05:10  <JensTi> Zaphus: it's only intended for our personal use, zeus is a workgroup of the ghent university, and we'd just like our own environment to play in
2010-09-09T20:05:22  <JensTi> I have access to all code uploaded to that server
2010-09-09T20:05:32  <jmcarthur> at least a lot of it is linus torvald style integration work instead of having to code everything himself
2010-09-09T20:05:35  <j3camero> a1k0n: it's the least I can do for all the people who were generous enough to spend time submitting changes, to merely get through the changes and merge them as appropriate.
2010-09-09T20:06:07  <bss03> j3camero: Any hope for sumitting stuff in Haskell?  I've been doing a lot of work on the Haskell starter package.

2010-09-09T20:07:09  <a1k0n> j3camero: we need an official resolution on a corner case in the spec though

2010-09-09T20:08:00  <a1k0n> j3camero: we are mostly in agreement on irc about the patch referred to in http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=64
2010-09-09T20:08:02  <javagamer_Cpp> j3camero, I never got my email!
2010-09-09T20:08:11  <a1k0n> it may be controversial
2010-09-09T20:08:29  <jmcarthur> i think the one person who disagreed with it on irc was Zaphus (ping so he can speak up if he wishes)
2010-09-09T20:08:40  <bss03> jmcarthur: That's the method where all the fleets fight at once, the biggest wins, ships remaining difference between top two?
2010-09-09T20:08:46  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-09T20:08:49  <a1k0n> j3camero: it is the third method ("players and neutral all fight at once") referred to in jmcarthur's post here: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=419&start=0#p2419
2010-09-09T20:08:49  <Cyndre> ships woot - registered
2010-09-09T20:09:11  <Cyndre> are the neutral planets going to increase in ships when the contest starts?
2010-09-09T20:09:29  <a1k0n> the biggest advantage method3 has right now is that it's implemented, tested, bugfixed, and tested
2010-09-09T20:09:30  <bss03> jmcarther: That seems the best one, really easy to generalize to n players as well.
2010-09-09T20:09:46  <ratatata> j3camero: is account creation officially open or these are still test accounts? (coz I'm waiting on my uni to be added to list)
2010-09-09T20:09:59  <j3camero> a1k0n: okay, reading now... will make an executive decision based on collective advice in a few minutes.
2010-09-09T20:10:11  <amstan> ratatata: you can keep those accounts after it's open

2010-09-09T20:10:22  <amstan> ratatata: i can deal with univ stuff, post on the forums
2010-09-09T20:10:28  <j3camero> ratatata: talk to amstan about adding universities. Go ahead and create your account now and we may be able to update your school later.

2010-09-09T20:10:58  <amstan> j3camero: oh yes, i got contestbot updated, it should of messaged you with some messages from ppl
2010-09-09T20:11:02  <ratatata> amstan: already did post on forums.. I believe it's not even on the last page anymore :)
2010-09-09T20:11:11  <danielvf> Although the 3rd method says no bais, it is biased in favor of attacking a turn later
2010-09-09T20:11:14  <amstan> ratatata: in fact, i'll do those right now
2010-09-09T20:11:32  <jmcarthur> danielvf: all of them are biased for that
2010-09-09T20:11:42  <danielvf> Except 2
2010-09-09T20:12:06  <ratatata> amstan: great, thanks.. I guess I'll wait a little more so you don't have to edit my school later etc
2010-09-09T20:12:06  <danielvf> jmcarthur: actulay
2010-09-09T20:12:07  <jmcarthur> danielvf: wouldn't you always rather your opponent have to fight off neutral by himself? maybe i need to think about it first
2010-09-09T20:12:23  <danielvf> jmcarthur: you are right
2010-09-09T20:12:29  <bss03> I think "no bias" means there's no different srategies for Player 2 than for Player 1.
2010-09-09T20:12:41  <jmcarthur> bss03: the bias is for or against neutral
2010-09-09T20:12:48  <danielvf> jmcarthur: It is however the lease biased against attacking now.
2010-09-09T20:13:10  <jmcarthur> danielvf: i agree with that, but that's just because it's the most biased against neutral
2010-09-09T20:13:16  <jmcarthur> which i actually point out in the post :P
2010-09-09T20:13:59  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: how about we leave it undefined - if two fleets attack at the same time, the world ends
2010-09-09T20:14:08  <a1k0n> yes, it must be avoided at all costs
2010-09-09T20:14:09  <jmcarthur> @slap Mathnerd314
2010-09-09T20:14:10  <contestbot> jmcarthur: Error: "slap" is not a valid command.
2010-09-09T20:14:14  <danielvf> Lol
2010-09-09T20:14:19  <jmcarthur> contestbot is worse than lambdabot
2010-09-09T20:14:20  <contestbot> jmcarthur: Error: "is" is not a valid command.
2010-09-09T20:14:23  <jmcarthur> that proves it
2010-09-09T20:14:28  <jmcarthur> !!
2010-09-09T20:14:30  <amstan> jmcarthur: lol..
2010-09-09T20:14:37  <jmcarthur> :P
2010-09-09T20:14:41  <amstan> jmcarthur: what do you want slap to do?
2010-09-09T20:14:45  <Mathnerd314> jmcarthur: lambdabot is gone? :-(

2010-09-09T20:15:00  <jmcarthur> Mathnerd314: amstan wanted contestbot to have the @ syntax
2010-09-09T20:15:06  <jmcarthur> so i had to make lambdabot leave
2010-09-09T20:15:17  <Cyndre> if two fleets arive at a neutral planet first (one fleet from each player) how is it decided whos get removed first?
2010-09-09T20:15:32  <danielvf> Cyndre: That's what we are discussing
2010-09-09T20:15:32  <a1k0n> that is the question!
2010-09-09T20:15:33  <jmcarthur> amstan: it's supposed to pick a random mean action to perform against the target nick
2010-09-09T20:15:38  <bss03> Cyndre: Good question!
2010-09-09T20:15:51  <a1k0n> to red or to green, that is the question
2010-09-09T20:15:52  <amstan> jmcarthur: make a plugin
2010-09-09T20:15:57  <Cyndre> should timestamp the command
2010-09-09T20:16:00  <jmcarthur> not worth it
2010-09-09T20:16:03  <bss03> Cyndre: I think we have 3 methods.  One actually encourages you to have a slightly smaller fleet than your opponent.
2010-09-09T20:16:04  <Cyndre> who initiated first is removed first
2010-09-09T20:16:20  <a1k0n> ooh, that would be... awful
2010-09-09T20:16:24  <JensTi> yeah, cause they have a longer trip ahead of them and are tired
2010-09-09T20:16:30  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: that hurts
2010-09-09T20:16:31  <Cyndre> or a main command queue we all submit to
2010-09-09T20:16:42  <Cyndre> and its just dealt with in order
2010-09-09T20:16:50  <bss03> I think using non-Integer travel times would solve things for all reasonable cases.
2010-09-09T20:16:57  <JensTi> Cyndre: that's not the point of a turn based game :P
2010-09-09T20:16:58  <danielvf> Naah
2010-09-09T20:16:59  <jmcarthur> bss03: which one encourages you to have a smaller fleet?
2010-09-09T20:17:03  <a1k0n> bss03: no, the map is symmetric
2010-09-09T20:17:07  <j3camero> Okay, which of these three methods do people think is going to produce the richest game? Is there any method which will totally discourage conflict? Ideally, we would pick the method that encourages conflict in a 1v1 scenario. Which method is that?
2010-09-09T20:17:25  <bss03> jmcarthur: The one where the larger fleet fights neutral first.
2010-09-09T20:17:27  <Cyndre> JensTi: this one isnt really turn based - because we can issue more commands then 1 and at any time
2010-09-09T20:17:33  <jmcarthur> bss03: none of them do that
2010-09-09T20:17:40  <a1k0n> i think it's a sufficiently rare thing except for the center planet that it doesn't matter a *whole* lot honestly, but it needs to be specified
2010-09-09T20:17:42  <javagamer_Cpp> I have a C++ issue (something's wrong with my code, not the starter code), would Technical Issues be the right place to put it?
2010-09-09T20:17:48  <bss03> The second method I read in the forum did.
2010-09-09T20:17:50  <danielvf> a1k0n: I'm with him
2010-09-09T20:17:57  <danielvf> a1k0n: I'm with you
2010-09-09T20:18:09  <danielvf> I don't think there is going to be a huge gameplay difference
2010-09-09T20:18:10  <jmcarthur> bss03: no, the second method is where *both* players fight neutral jointly
2010-09-09T20:18:12  <Cyndre> a random number will encourage you to submit fleets that land at the same time on neutral planets
2010-09-09T20:18:20  <jmcarthur> bss03: neutral damages them both equally
2010-09-09T20:18:22  <j3camero> Which method did we say had a working implementation already?
2010-09-09T20:18:29  <jmcarthur> j3camero: that would be the third
2010-09-09T20:18:31  <a1k0n> the third.
2010-09-09T20:18:31  <bss03> jmcarthur: That was the *first* method I read.
2010-09-09T20:18:34  <Cyndre> or have a 1 red, 1 blue, 1 red
2010-09-09T20:18:35  <Cyndre> ?
2010-09-09T20:18:42  <danielvf> danielvf: We could just go with #3, since there is a patch for that.
2010-09-09T20:18:43  <bss03> jmcarthur: The one with fractional losses (temporarily).
2010-09-09T20:18:47  <jmcarthur> bss03: isn't the first one where the players fight each other first?
2010-09-09T20:18:49  <j3camero> Method 3 is also the easiest to understand, and semingly the fairest.
2010-09-09T20:19:02  <jmcarthur> bss03: oh, i'm talking about the post where i state properties for them
2010-09-09T20:19:08  <jmcarthur> bss03: the ordering of that is method 1, 2, and 3
2010-09-09T20:19:20  <Cyndre> link to the different methods?
2010-09-09T20:19:33  <bss03> j3camero: I think all of them have implemetations floating around, none are too difficult to implement.
2010-09-09T20:19:44  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=419&start=0#p2419

2010-09-09T20:19:46  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  I disagreed with method 3, then I thought about it, then I agreed with it :-)
2010-09-09T20:19:47  <jmcarthur> bss03: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=419&start=0#p2419
2010-09-09T20:19:58  <a1k0n> Zaphus: same here
2010-09-09T20:20:08  <a1k0n> as i've said, i think method 3 is least palatable initially but ultimately fair
2010-09-09T20:20:26  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: :D
2010-09-09T20:20:40  <jmcarthur> i preferred method 2 at first, even as i wrote out method 3
2010-09-09T20:20:59  <jmcarthur> but then i changed my mind after writing out all the properties of them and having so much trouble with method 2
2010-09-09T20:21:08  <Cyndre> what about where its just a foreach(fleet _attacking_planet) {subtract 1 from planet and fleet}
2010-09-09T20:21:08  <jmcarthur> i *still* don't have it under my thumb
2010-09-09T20:21:08  <a1k0n> method 3 means if you send ships at a neutral planet, you are definitely going to make it easier to take over whatever else happens
2010-09-09T20:21:14  <danielvf> (Separate discussion, where is the source to the java game player)
2010-09-09T20:21:14  <bss03> when I first read method 3, I was like, that's silly, it doesn't seem like a space battle would ever work like that.
2010-09-09T20:21:26  <j3camero> It seems like we're reaching consensus around method 3. Should we go with that?
2010-09-09T20:21:27  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: that would be method 3

2010-09-09T20:21:38  <JensTi> you could have other methods
2010-09-09T20:22:01  <danielvf> j3camero: Yes. I don't think it's going to be worth extensive testing to see what happens to gameplay
2010-09-09T20:22:01  <a1k0n> danielvf: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest
2010-09-09T20:22:03  <Zaphus> j3camero: I think so, 3 may not be a true simulation of a space battle... but thats not what this is about.
2010-09-09T20:22:04  <bss03> But, I support it now.  It seems like it might increase the overall reduction in ship count, but that seems fair.
2010-09-09T20:22:05  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: method 3 simulates rounds of fighting where each triplet of P1, P2, and N cancel out, followed by rounds with pairs for the remaining two fleets

2010-09-09T20:25:09  <JensTi> I was wondering if we need to have a special link or so? you can see it here: http://zeus.ugent.be/challenge/
2010-09-09T20:25:45  <danielvf> Anyone mind if I make playgame.jar stream the playback string each turn, rather than all at once at the end?
2010-09-09T20:26:03  <jmcarthur> not only do i not mind, i want that
2010-09-09T20:26:10  <a1k0n> danielvf: go ahead; though it will conflict with a patch i made which got merged with another and hasn't been merged to trunk :(

2010-09-09T20:26:19  <a1k0n> i should have just made it do that instead

2010-09-09T20:29:00  <j3camero> Okay, I am going to be out of this chat for a while, while I focus on clearing code reviews. Any last words?
2010-09-09T20:29:16  <danielvf> Go for the code reviews.
2010-09-09T20:29:19  <j3camero> Also, I need advice on which order to tackle these code reviews. Are there any of them that suggest conflicting changes?
2010-09-09T20:29:24  <a1k0n> the python game engine patch i am submitting has not been tested by me FYI
2010-09-09T20:29:38  <j3camero> Cool a1k0n.
2010-09-09T20:29:42  <a1k0n> j3camero: nothing conflicting conceptually but there might be code conflicts
2010-09-09T20:29:54  <j3camero> a1k0n: good to know.
2010-09-09T20:29:57  <danielvf> visualizer is totally independent
2010-09-09T20:30:10  <a1k0n> actually it shares a lot of code with PlayGame.jar
2010-09-09T20:30:32  <a1k0n> j3camero: OTOH all the java code i submitted is pretty well tested now. :)

2010-09-09T20:42:06  <jmcarthur> bss03: i'm working on a patch to handle binaries premptively. maybe its existence could hurry things along :)
2010-09-09T20:42:48  <bss03> jmcarthur: Any easy way to get the source for a hackage module?  Besides C+P from the Haddock Source output?
2010-09-09T20:43:30  <jmcarthur> bss03: you can run cabal unpack mtl
2010-09-09T20:43:52  <a1k0n> danielvf: issue6492349283489
2010-09-09T20:44:09  <a1k0n> danielvf: that's the one which conflicts with what you want to do, and what youw ant to do supersedes it anyway
2010-09-09T20:44:18  <danielvf> Ah
2010-09-09T20:44:22  <bss03> That'll work.
2010-09-09T20:47:29  <j3camero> a1k0n: are you sure none of these code reviews conflict conceptually? There is a whole mess of issues that are superceding one another and such.
2010-09-09T20:47:51  <j3camero> a1k0n: you seem to have been looking at it for a while, I will follow your advice on what order I should tackle these in.
2010-09-09T20:48:56  <a1k0n> j3camero: i think the most important is the 64_69_etc_etc branch
2010-09-09T20:49:07  <a1k0n> this is most invasive to the engine etc
2010-09-09T20:49:28  <a1k0n> danielvf is proposing an extension which supersedes what's in there now, but that's ok
2010-09-09T20:49:44  <bss03> Someone link to an awesome looking game.  I finally got IW 3.5 installed, I want to see if the Canvas viz. works.
2010-09-09T20:49:47  <danielvf> I'm going to wait until merge
2010-09-09T20:49:48  <a1k0n> i should have made a separate branch for the output stuff.
2010-09-09T20:50:13  <danielvf> working on graphing for canvas
2010-09-09T20:50:28  <a1k0n> j3camero: pw_numships is utterly trivial, no reason not to merge (the C++ code could use a lot more help than that actually)
2010-09-09T20:50:49  <a1k0n> j3camero: canvas visualizer adds the current canvas visualizer without changing anything else on the site, so it'd be invisible to users
2010-09-09T20:51:02  <a1k0n> j3camero: issue78 is a bunch of optimizations which i'd like to get into the next starter pack
2010-09-09T20:51:11  <a1k0n> j3camero: gamelist_elo is totally untested but what we've wanted forever
2010-09-09T20:51:14  <j3camero> Okay I am starting with the canvas viz change then.
2010-09-09T20:52:44  <danielvf> j3camero: Good. I need to test that with real data on the real site. If there's a problem hopefully I can get in a new branch tonight.

2010-09-09T21:02:19  <j3camero> Oh damn, so it's already launch day.
2010-09-09T21:02:31  <danielvf> lol, just let the man review code. :P
2010-09-09T21:04:21  <j3camero> danielvf I am just merging the new viz with trunk. Gonna push it live in a few minutes. Let's see if it works. That was a hasty code review, so I hope nothing breaks. In the future, I will try to make code reviews more timely and orderly.
2010-09-09T21:05:01  <danielvf> j3camero:  NP. This one shouldn't break live site
2010-09-09T21:07:06  <j3camero> danielvf: yep, I agree.
2010-09-09T21:07:15  <j3camero> It's pretty low risk.
2010-09-09T21:07:29  <j3camero> And breaking the live site is not the end of the world either. I ahve done it so many times.
2010-09-09T21:07:47  <a1k0n> if only there were a backup site that talks to the db
2010-09-09T21:11:38  <JensTi> j3camero: I'm running a copy of your site with a couple of friends for personal use to try our bots against each other
2010-09-09T21:11:41  <j3camero> There could be some day.
2010-09-09T21:11:42  <JensTi> is that ok?
2010-09-09T21:11:52  <JensTi> you can view it here http://zeus.ugent.be/challenge/
2010-09-09T21:12:25  <j3camero> JensTi: I am so glad to hear that. I was hoping it would be easy enough to do that that other people would do it. That would really spur a lot of development too. You should bug me later to get added as a committer so you can contribute any changes you make.
2010-09-09T21:12:50  <JensTi> hehe, wel I spent some time reverse engineering your database table :P
2010-09-09T21:12:59  <a1k0n> yeah a schema dump would be helpful
2010-09-09T21:13:08  <a1k0n> show create table <x>
2010-09-09T21:13:21  <JensTi> but I made a post about it on our wiki
2010-09-09T21:13:21  <JensTi> https://zeus.ugent.be/wiki/Aichallenge
2010-09-09T21:13:26  <JensTi> works now :)
2010-09-09T21:13:26  <j3camero> Yes, I will add a schema dump.
2010-09-09T21:13:27  <jmcarthur> also some of the static info that's stored in it like the languages
2010-09-09T21:13:40  <JensTi> don't think I'll be far of
2010-09-09T21:14:07  <j3camero> JensTi: that is so cool. That is more than okay. Maybe we could arrange something where you're mirroring the implementation to provide a backup web server, or maybe even load balance the traffic?
2010-09-09T21:14:38  <a1k0n> i think he just wants to run a private competition
2010-09-09T21:14:53  <JensTi> well I'm just running it as a test now :P
2010-09-09T21:15:17  <JensTi> it would disqualify me from results probably
2010-09-09T21:15:17  <j3camero> danielvf: your changes are live. Can you find us a replay and let us see it?
2010-09-09T21:15:25  <JensTi> since I would have acces to other people's bots
2010-09-09T21:15:39  <j3camero> JensTi: that's true. You're right.

2010-09-09T21:16:01  <j3camero> JensTi: I am always looking around for ways to eliminate single points of failure, even if that means eliminating myself.
2010-09-09T21:16:05  <a1k0n> seems to be missing css?
2010-09-09T21:16:12  <JensTi> add the trailing slash
2010-09-09T21:16:19  <JensTi> https://zeus.ugent.be/wiki/Aichallenge/
2010-09-09T21:16:23  <JensTi> my bad
2010-09-09T21:16:24  <jmcarthur> woah what
2010-09-09T21:16:31  <jmcarthur> that replay is going crazy
2010-09-09T21:16:36  <a1k0n> whoa yeah
2010-09-09T21:16:40  <a1k0n> i think it's confused about which planet is which
2010-09-09T21:16:42  <danielvf> Press refresh?
2010-09-09T21:16:47  <a1k0n> yeah refreshing fixed the css
2010-09-09T21:16:48  <a1k0n> nem
2010-09-09T21:16:50  <JensTi> Its running on a virtual machine on a client in our basemant that's getting proxied
2010-09-09T21:16:51  <danielvf> Yeah, something is doofed
2010-09-09T21:16:57  <amstan> yeah!
2010-09-09T21:17:10  <jmcarthur> that's really cool looking at least
2010-09-09T21:17:24  <a1k0n> i bet the turns remaining and total turns on each fleet is reversed
2010-09-09T21:17:25  <danielvf> Sometimes ships go very slowly too.
2010-09-09T21:17:34  <a1k0n> or something like that
2010-09-09T21:17:36  <danielvf> Hmmm
2010-09-09T21:17:38  <danielvf> Maybe
2010-09-09T21:17:43  <jmcarthur> something like the turn count is wrong or something?
2010-09-09T21:18:13  <danielvf> That would explain the speeding up
2010-09-09T21:18:19  <a1k0n> guessing dhartmei reverseengineered the output format wrong and the vizualizer used his format

2010-09-09T21:42:58  <j3camero> JensTi: not sure why that would happen. My workaround it to have a lot of jail_users and periodically run planet_wars/backend/release_all_jail_users.py
2010-09-09T21:42:59  <phreeza> j3camero: ok cool. Its good pointing that out, the "Google" in the name makes it sound like it would be more centraly organuzed i guess.

2010-09-09T21:55:55  <danielvf> PurplePanda: For people using Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.
2010-09-09T21:56:21  <PurplePanda> yeah thats me :D
2010-09-09T21:57:18  <Zaphus> For those that are interested, I've been reliably informed that GalCon resolves conflicts by throwing the two sides at the planet first, then duking it out with the remaining ships.    Phil could give more info
2010-09-09T21:58:26  <JensTi> Zannick: this is about the parameters used to start tournament manager ?
2010-09-09T21:58:28  <phreeza> danielvf: nice! looking forward to more of that
2010-09-09T21:58:46  <phreeza> surprisingly linear, i thought it would look more exp
2010-09-09T21:58:54  <JensTi> it looks more like 5-10sec for 1 value to me

2010-09-09T22:00:15  <Zaphus> danielvf:  I like the graphing.  any chance of a vertical line moving across the graph showing where the playback is currently up to ?

2010-09-09T22:00:27  <JensTi> phreeza: all exponentials look lineair in the beginning ;)
2010-09-09T22:00:28  <danielvf> Zaphus: the next feature
2010-09-09T22:00:46  <danielvf> Zaphus: but I'm going to be working on the live site first.

2010-09-09T22:01:31  <phreeza> JensTi: not really, they are actually self-similar
2010-09-09T22:01:32  <jerkyface03> I'm not a part of any organization listed. Is it possible for me to team up with a friend or do I have to solo it?
2010-09-09T22:01:45  <phreeza> JensTi: just a question of scaling
2010-09-09T22:03:03  <jerkyface03> Also, if tomorrow is the start of signing up, why is the 'Current Rankings' section of the site active?
2010-09-09T22:03:14  <millertime> sign ups open tomorrow im excited :)

2010-09-09T22:09:33  <Zaphus> Hey Guys,  did the offical server get updated today ?  my bot seems to be getting a new game every couple of minutes, instead of every 30+ minutes like it was previously (not complaining!)
2010-09-09T22:10:04  <seigen_> they may have added more instances?
2010-09-09T22:10:27  <danielvf> They certainly fixed something
2010-09-09T22:11:04  <JensTi> isn't it just because theres more people on it?
2010-09-09T22:11:28  <Zaphus> no, other way around - more people equals less games for your bot - they take physical time
2010-09-09T22:11:46  <JensTi> nope
2010-09-09T22:11:53  <JensTi> it's not working flat out
2010-09-09T22:11:55  <JensTi> it
2010-09-09T22:12:12  <JensTi> it's just doing a battle once in a while
2010-09-09T22:12:18  <Zaphus> but I'm seeing multiple simultaneous games - 2 games started 8 seconds apart - and the games will have run longer than 8 seconds, so more CPUs
2010-09-09T22:12:36  <JensTi> my testgames take like 2-3seconds
2010-09-09T22:13:12  <danielvf> Someone want to research the best way to detect if a browser supports canvas well?
2010-09-09T22:14:02  <seigen_> I'm thinking more CPUs

2010-09-09T22:17:49  <JensTi> well, I'm wondering
2010-09-09T22:18:00  <JensTi> I'm also running tournament manager
2010-09-09T22:18:14  <JensTi> and it starts a game cpu usage of 100% for 3 seconds

2010-09-09T22:32:14  <amstan> tapwater: since contestbot has no connection to the database directly
2010-09-09T22:32:26  <jmcarthur> or it could do some heavy html scraping
2010-09-09T22:32:27  <tapwater> ah, ok
2010-09-09T22:32:29  <jmcarthur> which might suck

2010-09-09T22:32:49  <jmcarthur> i could look into that though

2010-09-09T22:34:54  <Zaphus> ok, the playgame.jar in the new c++ starter kit still seems to have the same bug where a fleet is lost (do a Ragebot vs Ragebot on map 44 to see it)
2010-09-09T22:34:56  <JensTi> if that's anything to you :P
2010-09-09T22:35:50  <mightybyte> JensTi: Yeah, but that map id doesn't help me.  It either needs to be the contents of the raw game file, or the filename of one of the maps in the starter packs.

2010-09-09T22:37:03  <Zaphus> j3camero:  I'd have assumed so, it's a pretty huge bug - but there's no info in those starter packs to say what version or fixes are implemented so no way to know  (pulling from the website)
2010-09-09T22:37:22  <mightybyte> But the ids might not even be maps that are in the starter pack.

2010-09-09T22:48:14  <seigen_> JensTi: did they?  It looks like the profile page is still broken.
2010-09-09T22:48:36  <bss03> jmcarthur: I feel confident I could write Control.Monad.State if needed so there's no point in writing it.  If that makes sense.
2010-09-09T22:49:07  <jmcarthur> bss03: hopefully j3camero approves binary submissions. then we wouldn't have to worry about all this

2010-09-09T22:58:31  <jmcarthur> well, thanks for your help. if i do decide to do it eventually then i will use your guide, for sure
2010-09-09T22:58:36  <JensTi> I should just have asked for a db chema
2010-09-09T22:58:37  <JensTi> shema

2010-09-09T23:01:32  <jmcarthur> amstan: it's the output from bayeselo
2010-09-09T23:02:13  <Zaphus> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4417282  - any way to find out what happened there ?    classed as a draw, but I find it hard to believe both bots failed on the first turn!
2010-09-09T23:02:19  <JensTi> jmcarthur: it looks like this http://pastebin.com/uHbitV2k
2010-09-09T23:02:57  <jmcarthur> JensTi: well, i know what it looks like, but i'm wanting the official one so i can match up what i'm doing with bots i'm more familiar with

2010-09-09T23:03:03  <jmcarthur> to make sure my results are making intuitive sense
2010-09-09T23:03:11  <jmcarthur> amstan: thanks!
2010-09-09T23:04:48  <pgpaskar_> amstan: how did site repair go?
2010-09-09T23:04:56  <pgpaskar_> or is it still broken in IE?
2010-09-09T23:05:07  <amstan> pgpaskar_: working on the bot now
2010-09-09T23:05:31  <Zaphus> @amstan:  does this look like a bug http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4417282  both bots failing on first turn or something, and mine has never failed a game
2010-09-09T23:05:32  <contestbot> Zaphus: Error: "amstan:" is not a valid command.
2010-09-09T23:05:44  <Zaphus> amstan:  does this look like a bug http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4417282  both bots failing on first turn or something, and mine has never failed a game
2010-09-09T23:06:00  <amstan> Zaphus: i don't know, sorry
2010-09-09T23:06:32  <Zaphus> there's no feedback from the server as to why a game ends - I think thats going to be a problem if games like that happen
2010-09-09T23:06:42  <pgpaskar_> Zaphus: you can pull the game string
2010-09-09T23:06:50  <pgpaskar_> better yet
2010-09-09T23:06:53  <pgpaskar_> ill do it
2010-09-09T23:08:21  <amstan> really??? lol: it doesn't have winner name in here: http://ai-contest.com/game_info.php?game_id=4415957
2010-09-09T23:08:51  <Zaphus> pgpaskar_: thanks, I think we need to indicate to the end user if a bot times out or does an illegal move (not to the bot, to the human looking at the website)
2010-09-09T23:10:01  <j3camero> Oh pgpaskar_ it's been a while.
2010-09-09T23:10:06  <j3camero> Nice to see you.
2010-09-09T23:10:31  <pgpaskar_> Yeah
2010-09-09T23:10:34  <pgpaskar_> Just got internet....
2010-09-09T23:10:35  <pgpaskar_> :|
2010-09-09T23:10:49  <Zannick> == Zaphus
2010-09-09T23:11:08  <Zannick> that would require adding a column to the schema for the game table
2010-09-09T23:11:15  <pgpaskar_> Zaphus: the game crashed
2010-09-09T23:11:18  <pgpaskar_> there are no recorded moves
2010-09-09T23:11:28  <pgpaskar_> well there are
2010-09-09T23:11:32  <pgpaskar_> but that is it
2010-09-09T23:11:41  <pgpaskar_> http://ai-contest.com/game_info.php?game_id=4417282
2010-09-09T23:11:42  <Zannick> or adding to the end of the playback string something the visualizer ignores
2010-09-09T23:11:42  <pgpaskar_> check it
2010-09-09T23:12:14  <pgpaskar_> it does not finish the first turn so this leads me to beleive that one of the bots made an illegal move
2010-09-09T23:12:19  <pgpaskar_> im not sure if there is a waytoverify that though
2010-09-09T23:12:20  <Zaphus> Zannick: agreed, It's really important to give the end user the info they need, otherwise the forums will light up with questions that cannot be answered, and it promotes ill feeling and distrust
2010-09-09T23:12:35  <Zannick> pgpaskar_: likely both of them
2010-09-09T23:12:40  <Zannick> since neither is present
2010-09-09T23:13:03  <Zaphus> pgpaskar_: the odds of that are very low (both doing illegal move on first turn) - wish we could somehow replicate these matches so we can see what went wrong
2010-09-09T23:13:48  <Zaphus> the playback needs to have that info in there, I have no way of knowing what happened in that match, so I'm going to blame the game engine - as would my opponent
2010-09-09T23:14:21  <pgpaskar_> See the issue here is that if any of the bots use randomness there is no way to replay the match...
2010-09-09T23:14:33  <pgpaskar_> But it might be benficial to record any errors that occur
2010-09-09T23:14:40  <Zaphus> pgpaskar_: no, the issue is that there is no record of what happened
2010-09-09T23:14:48  <pgpaskar_> I'm not sure if j3camero has a method of tracking these issues
2010-09-09T23:15:12  <pgpaskar_> I have not had a hand in the backend development.  I also need to work on that front-end some more now that i have internet and free time once lectures begin!
2010-09-09T23:15:19  <pgpaskar_> oh how I have missed you Waterloo
2010-09-09T23:15:34  <amstan> pgpaskar_: you could make sure you can replicate matches, if you do use randomness, use a static seed
2010-09-09T23:15:42  <amstan> pgpaskar_: then you can replicate stuff locally
2010-09-09T23:15:43  <Zaphus> j3camero:  we've got a match where, apparently, it ended on the very first turn in a draw, between bots that have not failed before  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4417282   we need some way to debug that and to give feedback to teh user as to why it stopped
2010-09-09T23:15:47  <pgpaskar_> but that would not replicate THESE matches unfortunately
2010-09-09T23:15:50  <amstan> pgpaskar_: problem is that there's no way to replicate CPU time
2010-09-09T23:16:03  <pgpaskar_> You need the exact conditions which is too much work to replicate
2010-09-09T23:16:15  <pgpaskar_> better to try to plan for future incidents than dwell on the ones which have already occured
2010-09-09T23:16:30  <amstan> well.. no.. he could try replicating that match right now
2010-09-09T23:16:45  <Zaphus> pgpaskar_:   Just try it again, it cant hurt.  Mine uses no randomness
2010-09-09T23:17:39  <pgpaskar_> i guess that could be tried..... in the mean time i need to shower while lacking cold water
2010-09-09T23:17:43  <pgpaskar_> what fun this new house is ~ . ~
2010-09-09T23:18:02  <jmcarthur> okay, i'm looking into the complaint that ranks are kind of strange using bayeselo before the elo score settles down a bit. see this issue for a little background on what i'm looking into: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=89 the database appears to currently have fields for "rank" (ordering) and for "score" (estimated elo score, currently). there are a few ways i could approach
2010-09-09T23:18:04  <jmcarthur>  this. i could (a) use the modified scoring system proposed in the issue to determine the rank but leave the score in the database the same, (b) use the modified score in place of the actual elo score, or (c) have a new column added to the table to store the modified score and have both that value and the elo score to show in various places
2010-09-09T23:18:07  <jmcarthur> i like (b) the least
2010-09-09T23:18:56  <j3camero> danielvf: heads up. I am going to svn switch the live website to your latest branch so we can have a look at the new visualizer before merging to trunk.
2010-09-09T23:19:05  <jmcarthur> this could also be combined with http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=88 (show confidence intervals of elo scores on profile pages), especially if (c) is chosen and the database is modified anyway
2010-09-09T23:19:55  <jmcarthur> personally i think (a) would be a nice balance between effort and payoff, although it could confusingly result in elo scores not being in order with rank
2010-09-09T23:20:14  <jmcarthur> which would probably require an FAQ entry
2010-09-09T23:20:42  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Any new information on Haskell support?
2010-09-09T23:20:45  <jmcarthur> the result of (a) would be basically that bots move up the ranks slowly even if their elo score is jumping all over the place
2010-09-09T23:20:48  <Zaphus> scores not in Elo order would be strange
2010-09-09T23:20:59  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: *estimated* elo order
2010-09-09T23:21:16  <Zaphus> true, but it still looks strange to the casual observer
2010-09-09T23:21:19  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i've submitted a small patch to allow arbitrary binaries, but it requires both approval and changes to the database
2010-09-09T23:21:44  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: hence the need for something being added to the faq :\
2010-09-09T23:21:58  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Ok.  I hope that passes.
2010-09-09T23:22:25  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: on the other hand, it would likely make the relative ranks of the bots feel more natural, especially when looking at bots that have played very few matches vs. those that have played many matches
2010-09-09T23:22:31  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Out of curiosity, what GHC features are you using that aren't in the version they're running?
2010-09-09T23:22:35  <Zaphus> nobody reads faq's - you're catering for thousands of people possibly.
2010-09-09T23:22:40  <tapwater> if we're talking about ranking systems
2010-09-09T23:22:45  <tapwater> we could take go kgs's approach
2010-09-09T23:22:56  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: it could perhaps be cleared up by saying that the scores are "estimated elo scores" rather than just "elo scores"
2010-09-09T23:22:58  <tapwater> they leave a "?" next to your username until you've played a couple games
2010-09-09T23:23:03  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  If you use the modified score for the ranking, why not just show it instead of Elo - if its the number we use then thats what people should see ?
2010-09-09T23:23:42  <tapwater> also, players's ranks that have a "?" change much more than a non-"?" would
2010-09-09T23:23:58  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: because ultimately the elo score denotes your true ability. the ranking is just a way of saying "we know with 99% probability that the bot is at least this good"
2010-09-09T23:24:03  <Zaphus> tapwater:  thats what I've done in Elo scoring systems in teh past (real world stuff)
2010-09-09T23:24:13  <j3camero> Whoops. Accidentally nuked the prod website. I be fixing this now...
2010-09-09T23:24:46  <jmcarthur> well, actually, that's a bad way to word the ranking
2010-09-09T23:24:51  <amstan> j3camero: yes... i tought my script was bad..
2010-09-09T23:24:52  <pgpaskar_> lol j3camero
2010-09-09T23:25:03  <Zannick> "whoops"
2010-09-09T23:25:04  <pgpaskar_> he made a new java viz or
2010-09-09T23:25:06  <pgpaskar_> other technology?
2010-09-09T23:25:12  <amstan> pgpaskar_: javascript canvas
2010-09-09T23:25:16  <amstan> @what visualizer
2010-09-09T23:25:16  <contestbot> amstan: visualizer could be (#1) http://github.com/DanielVF/Planet-Wars-Canvas-Visualizer, or (#2) http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~amstan/aichallenge/canvas-visualizer/.
2010-09-09T23:25:17  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: there is an argument to be made that the modified score could be used in place of elo score, yes
2010-09-09T23:25:17  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: I don't buy that, it either is your ability so show it, or it's not (not confident) so dont show it.   the modified score should equal the Elo score when confidence is high, right ?
2010-09-09T23:25:19  <pgpaskar_> does ie support this
2010-09-09T23:25:26  <amstan> pgpaskar_: apparently not
2010-09-09T23:25:37  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: xbox live shows the modified value and *not* your actual score, in fact
2010-09-09T23:25:39  <pgpaskar_> this was the reason we bothered with java
2010-09-09T23:25:48  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: so you may be right that it's better to use the adjusted one
2010-09-09T23:25:49  *** ratatata_ <ratatata_!4eb05c87@gateway/web/freenode/ip.78.176.92.135> has joined #aichallenge

2010-09-09T23:26:14  <amstan> pgpaskar_: personally i don't think the visualizer is an essential thing
2010-09-09T23:26:17  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: am I right thinking they would eventually be very similar numbers ?  once confidence is high ?
2010-09-09T23:26:18  <jmcarthur> pgpaskar_: ie users will be forwarded to the java viz
2010-09-09T23:26:21  <amstan> ratatata_: yeah.. j3camero nuked it by mistake
2010-09-09T23:26:25  <tapwater> haha did you join just to ask that ratatata ?
2010-09-09T23:26:39  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: yes. the only difference is that you will gradually rise in rank rather than jump around
2010-09-09T23:26:56  <ratatata_> no.. I also nuked my own comp.. original ratatata is logged in but window just disappeard :D
2010-09-09T23:27:08  <Zaphus> jmcarthur: that does seem better, more like what you would expect to see
2010-09-09T23:27:23  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: if you were to play infinite games they would be the same number
2010-09-09T23:27:24  <Zannick> aw shit
2010-09-09T23:27:27  <pgpaskar_> amstan: did you ever discover the IE issues on the forums?

2010-09-09T23:28:58  <jmcarthur> i'll summarize it this way: would you guys prefer an estimated elo score that jumps around a bit before settling down or one that slowly rises without jumping around?

2010-09-09T23:29:22  <asloane> the system is down

2010-09-09T23:30:18  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: the problem with a separate page for comparison is that the most feasible way for me to make the change directly changes the score that is put into the database, so it would have to be visible on the main ranking page

2010-09-09T23:32:35  <Zannick> ah, i need . at the end
2010-09-09T23:32:39  <Zannick> maybe
2010-09-09T23:33:03  <amstan> mightybyte: yay git
2010-09-09T23:33:18  <amstan> i would like to move to git next contest
2010-09-09T23:33:18  <Zannick> if it were git or hg branching would not be so hax
2010-09-09T23:33:33  <Zannick> arg svn merge
2010-09-09T23:33:48  <j3camero> Zannick: don't worry about it if it's minor. Just adopt practices to minimize the risk of accidentally committing to trunk in the future.

2010-09-09T23:34:20  <j3camero> mightybyte: nah, the issue was the key files that are not under version control. Git wouldn't help there.
2010-09-09T23:34:23  <amstan> it seems to be back up
2010-09-09T23:34:39  <pgpaskar_> so it seems to be using the java visualizer.... problems?
2010-09-09T23:34:39  <j3camero> Some files are intentionally not in the repo, sicne they have db passwords and such.
2010-09-09T23:34:54  <Zannick> i still can't undo the change
2010-09-09T23:34:55  <amstan> pgpaskar_: idk why
2010-09-09T23:35:15  <j3camero> Does anyone have the link for that problematic game replay on the new visualizer lying around?
2010-09-09T23:35:24  <asloane> i saw a couple 403s or something a little while back
2010-09-09T23:35:33  <j3camero> I just svn switched to the new new visualizer, and I wanna take a look.
2010-09-09T23:35:53  <j3camero> asloane == a1k0n?

2010-09-09T23:37:17  <pgpaskar_> that is far better
2010-09-09T23:37:52  <Zannick> aha, i see it
2010-09-09T23:38:01  <JensTi> my cpu liked the java on better
2010-09-09T23:38:08  <JensTi> but it's not supposed to be lazy
2010-09-09T23:38:12  <JensTi> so good :)
2010-09-09T23:38:29  <pgpaskar_> java one was running at a low low framerate
2010-09-09T23:38:40  <pgpaskar_> it used to be animated properly but idk what happened to that lol.
2010-09-09T23:39:01  <Zaphus> JensTi:  Looks nice, the graph is very handy
2010-09-09T23:39:18  <JensTi> Zaphus: it's not my doing :P

2010-09-09T23:40:11  <JensTi> chromium is much smoother then ff3
2010-09-09T23:40:16  <mistabell> very cool
2010-09-09T23:40:46  <j3camero> Should we put this new viz into trunk?
2010-09-09T23:40:51  <pgpaskar_> for sure
2010-09-09T23:40:52  <j3camero> I think we should
2010-09-09T23:40:53  <mistabell> I think so
2010-09-09T23:40:58  <j3camero> Let it be done
2010-09-09T23:41:00  <pgpaskar_> keep the java one only for IE users i guess
2010-09-09T23:41:06  <pgpaskar_> burn all other traces of it, it is an abomination
2010-09-09T23:41:30  <JensTi> but can we then please get the star background back on the canvas? :P
2010-09-09T23:41:36  <j3camero> In his comments, it says that it falls back to Java for people who have no canvas. I dunno if this part works properly.
2010-09-09T23:42:04  <Zaphus> needs some stars in the background :-)     any way to do a keyline around the text, or dropshadow ?, you can't see your fleets when they are over a planet of the same color.   Draw black text at  x+1, y+1,  then draw colored text at x,y
2010-09-09T23:42:48  <a1k0n> hi (trying to catch up)
2010-09-09T23:42:58  <Zaphus> j3camero:  If you open this link  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4417753   in firefox it is the new viz, in IE it is the old one, so I guess it works
2010-09-09T23:43:04  <a1k0n> j3camero: did the elo branch work at all?
2010-09-09T23:43:35  <a1k0n> and yeah, i will share my updated PlayGame/ShowGame jars
2010-09-09T23:43:50  <j3camero> back to the old version: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer_canvas.php?game_id=4417773 this is hilarious. Looks like blue is getting some extra ships from somewhere out in deep space.
2010-09-09T23:44:22  <j3camero> a1k0n: the elo branch works, but there is a problem. I commented on the review.
2010-09-09T23:44:24  <a1k0n> deus ex machina
2010-09-09T23:45:05  <pgpaskar_> whoa
2010-09-09T23:45:09  * AlliedEnvy considers writing his bot in Lua, does the server support it?
2010-09-09T23:45:09  <pgpaskar_> that is an interesting bug
2010-09-09T23:45:09  <pgpaskar_> XD
2010-09-09T23:45:09  <a1k0n> ahh, i see.  yeah, i was wondering how slow those queries would be
2010-09-09T23:45:17  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: here is a comparison of estimated elo score and adjusted score. i put the number of games played by each bot to the side also for clarity: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=29844#a29844
2010-09-09T23:45:25  <jmcarthur> anybody else who wants to see: ^^
2010-09-09T23:45:26  <a1k0n> AlliedEnvy: you could just upload the source to lua.. :)
2010-09-09T23:45:27  <Zannick> i...don't see anything happening in that game
2010-09-09T23:45:56  <bss03> j3camero: That game doesn't appear to be rendering correctly for me.
2010-09-09T23:46:03  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: how did you get confidence?
2010-09-09T23:46:14  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: i just cheated and used '-' :\
2010-09-09T23:46:17  <Zannick> it is 94 turns of 100 vs 100 and no fleets or growth
2010-09-09T23:46:20  <j3camero> bss03: it's okay. It's the old one. I am about to update it in trunk.
2010-09-09T23:46:39  <AlliedEnvy> a1k0n: I suppose so, seems kinda hacky though
2010-09-09T23:46:39  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: from the official site or benzedrine.cx?
2010-09-09T23:46:49  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: those are from official

2010-09-09T23:47:39  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: yeah, those people will be heavily penalized, but then shoot up pretty quick
2010-09-09T23:48:16  <a1k0n> it's sorta awesome that galcon has the baseline elo score near 0
2010-09-09T23:48:20  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  Thats perfect, its not a penalty, it's just that you naturally start at the bottom as most people would expect  (although I imagine it will be higher than the bottom for most)
2010-09-09T23:48:21  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-09T23:48:24  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-09T23:48:33  <jmcarthur> well no
2010-09-09T23:48:39  <jmcarthur> it's likely to be very near the bottom
2010-09-09T23:48:44  <jmcarthur> rather than near the middle as it is now, i think
2010-09-09T23:48:49  <PurplePanda> it does not automatically go to _canvas.php on my chrome :-(
2010-09-09T23:49:00  <Zaphus> jmcarthur:  yes, bottom 10% or so anyway, allowing for some stupid bots in there
2010-09-09T23:49:05  <jmcarthur> i guess
2010-09-09T23:49:12  <jmcarthur> oh snap
2010-09-09T23:49:17  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: i did it wrong though :P
2010-09-09T23:49:34  <jmcarthur> it's supposed to change things about 3 times as much, if i go by the trueskill rule i mentioned

2010-09-09T23:49:46  <jmcarthur> lemme try this again
2010-09-09T23:49:56  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: but '-' is about 3sigma
2010-09-09T23:50:00  <jmcarthur> oh
2010-09-09T23:50:01  <jmcarthur> nevermind
2010-09-09T23:50:03  <jmcarthur> :)
2010-09-09T23:50:07  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: it's right, nevermind
2010-09-09T23:50:10  <a1k0n> (very roughly)
2010-09-09T23:50:14  <jmcarthur> yeah, close enough
2010-09-09T23:50:26  <jmcarthur> slightly... less than 3 sigma, right?
2010-09-09T23:50:31  <Zaphus> ok, I have to ask (to no-one in particular).  whats with the Elo scores that go from -ve to +ve ?    I've always seen scores that center around the 1200 mark, and a floor of maybe 200-400
2010-09-09T23:50:48  <amstan> pgpaskar_: you know your game_data.php, does the protocol tell me a way to get the winner's name?
2010-09-09T23:50:50  <Zaphus> by always I mean in other Elo implementations in the real world
2010-09-09T23:50:54  <a1k0n> Zaphus: well, the only thing that matters is the difference between scores of opponents
2010-09-09T23:50:55  <amstan> i don't want id, i want name
2010-09-09T23:50:56  <pgpaskar_> winner=
2010-09-09T23:51:03  <amstan> pgpaskar_: that's id
2010-09-09T23:51:04  <a1k0n> so you can shift the entire range arbitrarily
2010-09-09T23:51:10  <jmcarthur> Zaphus: no idea, but i don't really care. these are still at least reliable relatively
2010-09-09T23:51:11  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  I know mathematically thats true, but for human beings it's not
2010-09-09T23:51:27  <a1k0n> yeah, so i guess it could just add 1000 or something
2010-09-09T23:51:34  <pgpaskar_> hmm.  true.  you may need to look that up on the database somehow
2010-09-09T23:51:39  <jmcarthur> okay, so you guys think i should make the patch and submit it for review then? just make it take the place of elo?
2010-09-09T23:51:47  <pgpaskar_> i did not write that file tbh i havent written much of anything to my dismay

2010-09-09T23:52:04  <jmcarthur> well, take the place of the median estimated elo
2010-09-09T23:52:11  <jmcarthur> it's still technically going to drift toward elo
2010-09-09T23:52:12  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: well, i'm a little concerned for the final results
2010-09-09T23:52:24  <j3camero> Okay, the new canvas visualizer is pushed to the live web server. Yay for danielvf!
2010-09-09T23:52:33  <a1k0n> i'd rather have it use the mode or mean after all games that will have been played are played
2010-09-09T23:52:46  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: point
2010-09-09T23:52:47  <a1k0n> cuz #1 might lose just because of the erratic behavior of hits opponents
2010-09-09T23:52:58  <a1k0n> (widening his confidence interval)
2010-09-09T23:53:07  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: then again, i'd rather the standard deviation be really tiny by the end anyway
2010-09-09T23:53:24  <a1k0n> yeah but it's definitely going to have overlaps at 95% confidence
2010-09-09T23:53:34  <jmcarthur> :\
2010-09-09T23:53:41  <a1k0n> if the last contest was anything to go by, when #2-#6 had like a 10-elo-point spread
2010-09-09T23:53:59  <jmcarthur> yeah but we have no idea what those confidence intervals actually were
2010-09-09T23:54:23  <a1k0n> well, judging from benzedrine.cx's typical results, i'd say they were at least +/- 20
2010-09-09T23:54:35  <a1k0n> then again they did have a shitload more games so maybe not
2010-09-09T23:54:52  <jmcarthur> amstan, j3camero: i know you guys wanted to avoid revealing the confidence intervals from the last tournament, but if you guys have that data around it would be nice to have in context of this conversation
2010-09-09T23:55:03  <a1k0n> it might be good to show.
2010-09-09T23:55:06  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  so how would you resolve that - both methods risk the leader being 'wrong'
2010-09-09T23:55:21  <a1k0n> well, the mean is the most probably least-wrong answer
2010-09-09T23:55:50  <Zaphus> a1k0n:  you could always do a 9-match playoff to decide the overall winner, or something like that
2010-09-09T23:55:53  <a1k0n> but for the live contest, it totally makes sense to use the lower bound just to compensate for various numbers of games
2010-09-09T23:55:53  <jmcarthur> it is the "most likely correct" answer, i think
2010-09-09T23:56:17  <jmcarthur> a1k0n: would could just use this for the live contest and worry about it again as the end approaches
2010-09-09T23:56:23  <a1k0n> so i think we should use the lower bound as jmcarthur suggests, and then just disable that for the final contest
