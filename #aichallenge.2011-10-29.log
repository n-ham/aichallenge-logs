2011-10-29T00:05:10  <mediocrist> anyone around?
2011-10-29T00:05:29  <thestinger> hi
2011-10-29T00:06:15  <mediocrist> you go through the tutorials by chance? I'm trying to do the first Java HashMap tutorial
2011-10-29T00:06:18  <mediocrist> to no avail
2011-10-29T00:06:29  <thestinger> yeah, but I did them in python
2011-10-29T00:07:21  <mediocrist> it looks easier in python
2011-10-29T00:07:33  <mediocrist> the java bot is broken into a couple different classes
2011-10-29T00:08:18  <mediocrist> anyone else lurking?

2011-10-29T00:09:33  <synace> i'm thinking about caching my paths and having each ant go on that path until it asks for or gets new orders
2011-10-29T00:09:36  <mediocrist> yeah, I just picked up java about a week ago and am trying to stick to form
2011-10-29T00:09:55  <bobbydroptable> ah cool
2011-10-29T00:10:00  <bobbydroptable> yeh i picked up python for this as well
2011-10-29T00:10:34  <mediocrist> the code they supply references a class that doesn't exist yet. I'm probably just missing something
2011-10-29T00:10:59  <mediocrist> I wish they had a post-tutorial bot prebuilt so I could reference what they're doing
2011-10-29T00:11:34  <ZeroBrain> are you using make to build you bot int java
2011-10-29T00:11:57  <mediocrist> yeah
2011-10-29T00:12:20  <ZeroBrain> If they have not fixed it, it does not build all the .java files.
2011-10-29T00:12:33  <ZeroBrain> Use javac *.java
2011-10-29T00:12:50  <mediocrist> hold on, lemme give it a try

2011-10-29T00:15:03  <mediocrist> keeps erroring on compile
2011-10-29T00:15:08  <ZeroBrain> you make need to make your jar with "jar cvfm MyBot.jar Manifest.txt *.class
2011-10-29T00:15:10  <bobbydroptable> isn't it HashMap
2011-10-29T00:15:24  <bobbydroptable> with a big M
2011-10-29T00:15:31  <bobbydroptable> =)
2011-10-29T00:15:37  <mediocrist> yeah, typo in irc. I'm copy/pasting
2011-10-29T00:15:42  <mediocrist> into the code
2011-10-29T00:15:42  <bobbydroptable> oh
2011-10-29T00:15:52  <bobbydroptable> well HashMap is a standard collection class
2011-10-29T00:16:06  <bobbydroptable> as long as you have JDK 6 you should have it
2011-10-29T00:16:21  <ZeroBrain> are you using java 6
2011-10-29T00:16:23  <bobbydroptable> assuming java.collections.* is imported.
2011-10-29T00:17:05  <bobbydroptable> sorry its java.util
2011-10-29T00:17:23  <bobbydroptable> so make sure java.util.* is imported. that's the package containing HashMap
2011-10-29T00:17:36  <mediocrist> java.util.collections.*? or just the java.util.HashMap;

2011-10-29T00:32:00  <synace> my firs tattempt... thought it timesout at the moment :/ http://synace.netau.net/ai/replay.0.html
2011-10-29T00:33:29  <synace> how's it look compared to the good ones ppl have seen?
2011-10-29T00:34:09  <thestinger> the game is too short to tell :P
2011-10-29T00:34:15  <a1k0n> now you're being checked for malicious content
2011-10-29T00:34:19  <synace> thestinger: it's timing out
2011-10-29T00:34:37  <thestinger> yeah, your link just died
2011-10-29T00:34:48  <synace> thestinger: i have to revise to use memory more & cpu less (re-calculating all paths every turn)
2011-10-29T00:35:04  <synace> thestinger: i ended it at 50 turns
2011-10-29T00:35:38  <thestinger> I actually recalculate paths every turn
2011-10-29T00:35:53  <synace> i'm using weighted A* mostly
2011-10-29T00:36:07  <synace> thestinger: i'm using PHP ;)
2011-10-29T00:36:12  <synace> i.e. sloooow
2011-10-29T00:36:42  <thestinger> I do a breadth-first search from each target (enemy hills, food, unseen locations) across the map and mark the distance of every node
2011-10-29T00:37:23  <synace> what's the turn timeout on live server?
2011-10-29T00:37:33  <synace> mem is 1.5gb right?
2011-10-29T00:37:49  <thestinger> I think mem is 1gb (I might be wrong)
2011-10-29T00:38:09  <thestinger> turn timeout if 500ms iirc, but you should make your bot scale to different timeouts in case it changes
2011-10-29T00:38:37  <synace> right, it can read the timeout IIRC
2011-10-29T00:38:57  <thestinger> yeah
2011-10-29T00:47:53  <McLeopold> synace: use paste.aichallenge.org, and paste the 0.replay text
2011-10-29T00:48:02  <synace> McLeopold: thanks
2011-10-29T00:49:19  <synace> http://paste.aichallenge.org/eejCU/
2011-10-29T00:49:51  <McLeopold> you look a little too purple...
2011-10-29T00:50:41  <McLeopold> that's better
2011-10-29T00:52:11  <synace> McLeopold: now if I can just get it to not take 3s when I have 10 ants on stage ;)
2011-10-29T00:52:31  <McLeopold> well don't follow the tutorial
2011-10-29T00:52:45  <synace> ?
2011-10-29T00:52:58  <synace> i didn't know there was 1 :)
2011-10-29T00:53:18  <synace> i just downloaded the zip and got to work on a solution using A*
2011-10-29T00:53:21  <McLeopold> http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial.php
2011-10-29T00:53:33  <McLeopold> You might be beyond it
2011-10-29T00:54:06  <McLeopold> how do you store your open list?
2011-10-29T00:54:11  <synace> McLeopold: yeah, this run was proof of concept for the 'pick a target' & return 'nsew' algorithm
2011-10-29T00:54:46  <synace> my code is basically stateless between turns at the moment, no real memory between turns
2011-10-29T00:54:47  <thestinger> now that I don't just use manhattan distance to decide on where to send ants my bot doesn't totally fail on maze maps anymore :D
2011-10-29T00:55:30  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.11252 <- I'm strcat (still no real combat stuff done yet though)
2011-10-29T00:56:38  <synace> thestinger: i have not yet dealt w/ the map wrapping, any advice? (i was thinking about re-centering to the ant)
2011-10-29T00:57:15  <thestinger> for graph traversal stuff I just deal with it when I figure out which nodes are connected
2011-10-29T00:57:30  <thestinger>     new_row = row == 0 ? state.rows - 1 : row - 1; // wrap (col, row - 1)
2011-10-29T00:57:39  <McLeopold> create a node graph and ignore coordinates
2011-10-29T00:57:39  <thestinger> just 4 lines like that for each direction
2011-10-29T00:58:05  <synace> McLeopold: i have node graph, i guess i just never thought to connect it in a sphere ;) lol
2011-10-29T00:58:15  <McLeopold> torus
2011-10-29T00:58:29  <synace> i'm wrapping the whole thing in a box with edges at the moment
2011-10-29T00:58:40  <McLeopold> plus it gets smaller with more discovered water
2011-10-29T00:59:01  <bobbydroptable> how did you go about building your node graph
2011-10-29T00:59:08  <bobbydroptable> i have my own way, but i'm interested to know how others did it
2011-10-29T00:59:11  <bobbydroptable> whether it was the same as me
2011-10-29T00:59:16  <synace> McLeopold: doughnut?
2011-10-29T00:59:16  <thestinger> I've done it 3 different ways
2011-10-29T00:59:26  <McLeopold> yeah, same as torus
2011-10-29T00:59:44  <bobbydroptable> a doughnut is torus shaped.
2011-10-29T00:59:47  <synace> gotcha
2011-10-29T00:59:49  <thestinger> when I was using python I just used a dictionary of lists, with the node as the key and the list containing the keys of connected nodes
2011-10-29T01:00:18  <synace> i traverse and each node contains refrences to connected nodes
2011-10-29T01:00:26  <bobbydroptable> yeh but i mean, how did you build the graph
2011-10-29T01:00:28  <synace> stored in dictionary similarly
2011-10-29T01:00:30  <bobbydroptable> evenly spaced nodes?
2011-10-29T01:00:37  <bobbydroptable> or dynamically grown graphs
2011-10-29T01:00:54  <synace> i dig through the rows x cols && compare $map
2011-10-29T01:01:02  <bobbydroptable> every turn?
2011-10-29T01:01:04  <bobbydroptable> :O
2011-10-29T01:01:05  <synace> :)
2011-10-29T01:01:08  <synace> hence my timeout
2011-10-29T01:01:12  <bobbydroptable> hehehe ok
2011-10-29T01:01:15  <synace> just proof of concept at the moment
2011-10-29T01:01:16  <thestinger> my C++ A* implementation didn't really use a graph
2011-10-29T01:01:34  <thestinger> I just reused the 2d vector of location structs
2011-10-29T01:01:48  <synace> thestinger: i saw one of your ants stop & go back towards your hill, what happened there?
2011-10-29T01:01:54  <thestinger> but now that's all replaced with my new pathfinding
2011-10-29T01:02:17  <synace> ant1 after ant3 spawned
2011-10-29T01:02:18  <thestinger> synace: I don't store food locations at all, so if moving to a food location requires losing sight of it my ants can go back and forth
2011-10-29T01:02:36  <thestinger> I only send 1 ant to a food so it doesn't really matter
2011-10-29T01:02:50  <synace> thestinger: at that point there was no food to be sought
2011-10-29T01:03:06  <synace> i've got a backup target to 'explore' to farthest point away from home hill
2011-10-29T01:03:37  <thestinger> Fluxid told us a really awesome way of dealing with pathfinding and I do that now, so I can recalculate everything every turn
2011-10-29T01:03:59  <thestinger> and I can actually go through every single food/unseen location/enemy hill each turn
2011-10-29T01:04:00  <synace> thestinger: GPL'd?
2011-10-29T01:04:01  <synace> :)
2011-10-29T01:04:07  <thestinger> not code, just a method :P
2011-10-29T01:04:09  <synace> ah
2011-10-29T01:04:12  <thestinger> he just explained it in a few lines
2011-10-29T01:04:16  <thestinger> so
2011-10-29T01:04:33  <thestinger> for hills right now, I make a single hill_graph variable which is a 2d vector of ints
2011-10-29T01:04:41  <thestinger> (enemy hills)
2011-10-29T01:05:08  <thestinger> then I do a breadth-first search from each hill, and mark the shortest distances to a hill
2011-10-29T01:05:36  <thestinger> I do the same for _each_ unseen location (I realize that's stupid, but it hardly takes any time) and each food
2011-10-29T01:06:44  <synace> thestinger: i'm hoping to accomplish a reasonably good bot with PHP. it's going to be a challenge to stay under the timeout
2011-10-29T01:07:07  <thestinger> then I can just check the value in the 2d vector for an ant to get the distance to a target
2011-10-29T01:07:32  <thestinger> and then I check the neighbouring locations and move to one where the distance is lower
2011-10-29T01:07:52  <thestinger> so it's like making a height map, with stuff that's further away having a higher value
2011-10-29T01:09:22  <thestinger> I have 1 2d "height map" for enemy hills, one for unseen locations and one for each food
2011-10-29T01:10:09  <synace> thestinger: i'm doing A* for each ant, not each hill
2011-10-29T01:10:31  <thestinger> each, I was doing A* for each ant to each location
2011-10-29T01:10:42  <thestinger> now I just make a height map for each location, and I don't need any more pathfinding
2011-10-29T01:10:47  <thestinger> it's a _lot_ faster
2011-10-29T01:11:16  <synace> i'll give it a look thx

2011-10-29T01:17:19  <thestinger> synace: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/499863/ here's what it looks like when I find an enemy hill - I mark 0 as the distance where the enemy hill is, then do a BFS and mark all the other distances
2011-10-29T01:17:53  <thestinger> if there are multiple hills, I mark another 0 in that 2d vector and do a BFS from there
2011-10-29T01:17:54  <McLeopold> amstan_: should we point ants.aichallenge.org now?
2011-10-29T01:18:04  <thestinger> -1 means I know there's water there
2011-10-29T01:18:04  <McLeopold> for permenant urls?
2011-10-29T01:18:06  <synace> thestinger: -1 = water?
2011-10-29T01:18:07  <synace> ah
2011-10-29T01:18:20  <amstan_> McLeopold: how do you think that will work?
2011-10-29T01:18:45  <McLeopold> ants.aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=1 will always point to the right ants game
2011-10-29T01:18:56  <synace> thestinger: yeah, that'd be faster to create than determining the absolute 'fastest' route.
2011-10-29T01:18:58  <amstan_> what about all the current links?
2011-10-29T01:18:58  <McLeopold> with out the ant. prefix, it would be the game of the season
2011-10-29T01:19:24  <McLeopold> don't know
2011-10-29T01:19:31  <amstan_> if we do not enforce the url, most people will try permalinking to aichallenge.org, and that's not a good idea

2011-10-29T01:19:52  <thestinger> synace: I do the same thing for exploration too - here's what it looks like early in the game http://paste.pocoo.org/show/499865/
2011-10-29T01:20:09  <McLeopold> we probably broke any planet wars links
2011-10-29T01:20:25  <thestinger> I go through each unseen location and mark them as 0, then do a BFS from there (which is fast for most, because they are just surrounded by 4 other unseen locs, so the search ends right away)
2011-10-29T01:20:25  <amstan_> yes we did
2011-10-29T01:21:33  <thestinger> synace: same 2d vector later in the game http://paste.pocoo.org/show/499866/
2011-10-29T01:22:01  <synace> thestinger: that's a single graph used by all ants for explore?
2011-10-29T01:22:06  <thestinger> anyway, doing it like this gets you the true distance to a location (assuming all unseen places are water) and does all your pathfinding
2011-10-29T01:22:11  <thestinger> yup, I generate it once and they all use it
2011-10-29T01:22:36  <McLeopold> amstan_: well, at least we can give people who care an option that will work
2011-10-29T01:22:46  <synace> yeah, pathfinding would seem to be faster this way than A*
2011-10-29T01:22:46  <thestinger> I look up explore_graph[ant.row][ant.col] and then move to a neighbour with a lower value (lower distance to an unseen location)
2011-10-29T01:23:10  <amstan_> McLeopold: how about separating the links somehow?
2011-10-29T01:23:16  <synace> makes sense
2011-10-29T01:23:22  <McLeopold> which links?
2011-10-29T01:23:26  <amstan_> McLeopold: try to make everything that's current contest to redirect to ants.aichallenge.org
2011-10-29T01:23:40  <amstan_> and stuff like server stats, forums, homepage to go to aichallenge.org
2011-10-29T01:23:45  <McLeopold> that makes sense, redirect everything now
2011-10-29T01:23:51  <thestinger> synace: I'm doing this is my python prototyping too, and it works fine if you don't do it for every single unseen location/food
2011-10-29T01:24:16  <amstan_> we could also assume all calls to ai-contest.com is for the planetwars contest, and redirect is as appropriatelly to planetwars.
2011-10-29T01:24:23  <synace> for my A* path finding, i treat unseen spots as land
2011-10-29T01:24:36  <thestinger> I do that too

2011-10-29T01:25:04  <McLeopold> amstan_: again, a brilliant idea
2011-10-29T01:25:12  <amstan_> problem is implementing it
2011-10-29T01:25:27  <amstan_> or not?
2011-10-29T01:25:32  <McLeopold> apache rewrites ftw?
2011-10-29T01:25:35  <amstan_> i guess not, it's just a list inside the apache rewrites
2011-10-29T01:25:59  <synace> RewriteRule %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.)?ai-contest\.com$
2011-10-29T01:26:12  <amstan_> though.. if we leave the anchors as they are, a lot of page requests will be redirects
2011-10-29T01:26:38  <amstan_> example: person going from homepage to  rankings, to server statistics, to problem description and then to the forums
2011-10-29T01:26:48  <amstan_> twice the page loads
2011-10-29T01:27:01  <McLeopold> I thought we used relative?
2011-10-29T01:27:07  <amstan_> McLeopold: we do

2011-10-29T01:28:03  <rj_> in the ant tutorial
2011-10-29T01:28:08  <McLeopold> so, anything with aichallenge.org gets sent to ants.

2011-10-29T01:32:35  <McLeopold> synace: do you want the food or not :)
2011-10-29T01:32:51  <McLeopold> wait, its a simple bfs search
2011-10-29T01:32:53  <synace> McLeopold: at this point I don't want to timeout :/
2011-10-29T01:33:03  <rj_> hmmm i just downloaded... it exists... sorry guys and thank you
2011-10-29T01:33:14  <synace> McLeopold: also don't want to switch to C.. would just be happy winning in the PHP category
2011-10-29T01:33:30  <synace> doing this as an exercise for my local PHP user group members
2011-10-29T01:34:16  <McLeopold> well, any language is fast enough to do a bfs
2011-10-29T01:35:04  <burny> what's bfs mean?
2011-10-29T01:35:13  <McLeopold> breadth first search
2011-10-29T01:35:42  <McLeopold> basically, paint outwards from each ant at the same rate
2011-10-29T01:35:53  <synace> bfs == nested set right?
2011-10-29T01:35:59  <McLeopold> or, since you care about food, paint out from each food square
2011-10-29T01:35:59  <burny> oh, just brute force path finding?
2011-10-29T01:36:24  <amstan_> McLeopold: anyway, so subdomains!
2011-10-29T01:36:37  <McLeopold> amstan_: FTW!
2011-10-29T01:36:48  <synace> amstan_: redirect all linux users to ants. :)
2011-10-29T01:36:49  <McLeopold> burny: yep
2011-10-29T01:36:54  <amstan_> McLeopold: yes, except they'll be slow, do you understand my dillema?
2011-10-29T01:37:02  <McLeopold> amstan_: no, I don't see the problem
2011-10-29T01:37:14  <amstan_> McLeopold: ok, let me write it up
2011-10-29T01:37:18  <McLeopold> amstan_: just make everything goto ants.aichallenge.org
2011-10-29T01:37:26  <McLeopold> after the first hit, never go back
2011-10-29T01:37:52  <amstan_> McLeopold: oh, ok
2011-10-29T01:37:54  <amstan_> that's easy
2011-10-29T01:38:33  <amstan_> McLeopold: mailing list is it
2011-10-29T01:38:37  <amstan_> McLeopold: but you have to support me on it
2011-10-29T01:38:47  <synace> has any1 incorporated any routing algorithms?
2011-10-29T01:38:48  <amstan_> McLeopold: what about ai-contest.com?
2011-10-29T01:39:04  <amstan_> McLeopold: i don't want to redirect everything to planetwars
2011-10-29T01:40:32  <McLeopold> synace: BFS https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L1237
2011-10-29T01:40:39  <McLeopold> amstan_: why not?
2011-10-29T01:41:13  <thestinger> synace: if you do a BFS from a dest, you can reuse that and get free pathfinding/distance measurements for all ants to that dest

2011-10-29T01:42:26  <McLeopold> ok
2011-10-29T01:42:45  <McLeopold> but we should wait until it's up and running somewhere :)

2011-10-29T01:44:09  <amstan_> McLeopold: i'm going to redirect things again
2011-10-29T01:44:11  <amstan_> lol
2011-10-29T01:45:29  <synace> McLeopold: i'm currently using A*, but it's benefits are specific to a->b, BFS seems to cache a portion of the solution and provides a decent enough result for a single turn
2011-10-29T01:45:46  <synace> A* is giving too good of a result, it's not worth the effort it seems
2011-10-29T01:46:56  <thestinger> you can find shortest paths with bfs, you just need to store the result in a nice way
2011-10-29T01:47:05  <McLeopold> synace: if you start doing well, you will always have more ants than targets, or more targets than ants

2011-10-29T02:23:21  <janzert> all the numbers are squished together now instead of spread out across the page nicely ;)

2011-10-29T02:26:06  <janzert> I really agree with the change overall, just I'll add some specific css on the stats page to make it look a little better now
2011-10-29T02:26:27  <amstan> woah, there's more space for workers now
2011-10-29T02:26:43  <janzert> heh, no there's the same space. they're just left justified now
2011-10-29T02:26:56  <McLeopold> and lost the width 100%
2011-10-29T02:27:01  <mleise> amstan: I do get a different error with live replays.
2011-10-29T02:27:17  <amstan> nonono, there's more space or something, so now we can afford more workers per competition

2011-10-29T02:31:14  <janzert> and yeah it was that's why we changed
2011-10-29T02:31:38  <janzert> several people got over fitted for the opponents in the ranks around them
2011-10-29T02:31:56  <janzert> and when they played a broader range at the start of the finals had problems
2011-10-29T02:32:12  <_flag> Ah
2011-10-29T02:32:26  <janzert> starting at the bottom each time shows that you still beat everyone on the way up basically
2011-10-29T02:32:57  <_flag> True, my biggest problem is that by the time my bot starts playing against top players, I've made some improvements and its no longer my best work
2011-10-29T02:33:13  <_flag> But I also don't want to keep resubmitting because then I never play any good games
2011-10-29T02:33:15  <janzert> and it seems to only take about a half dozen games or so to climb back to the top
2011-10-29T02:33:36  <_flag> Games are played once every 12 hours or so though
2011-10-29T02:33:39  <McLeopold> _flag: also, I think the trueskill updates provide more information (larger updates) with properly matched opponents, so you would rise faster
2011-10-29T02:34:04  <janzert> _flag: average is closer to 4-5 hours
2011-10-29T02:34:27  <_flag> Okay, I'll try resubmitting then, thanks

2011-10-29T03:04:30  <mleise> McLeopold: I think Rhino had problems when Math.sqrt was applied to a multidimensional array. I don't know if that is defined behavior. Also I was passing the value array by ref into the rendering function, so the in-place sqrt() scaled the values over and over until they all were 1.0 ^^
2011-10-29T03:06:37  <mleise> well it wasn't exactly a multidimensional array, since map() applied the sqrt to each element, which was a normal array then.

2011-10-29T04:42:20  <wish_> if I send in 'S' as direction
2011-10-29T04:42:28  <wish_> there should be an axis value that decreases somewhere
2011-10-29T04:42:31  <wish_> not one that increases
2011-10-29T04:42:41  <antimatroid1> what about the other 3 directions? the work out what way to rotate the map such that they match up
2011-10-29T04:42:45  <antimatroid1> then work out where that is going wrong
2011-10-29T04:42:46  <bobbydroptable> because origin is on top left, it increases
2011-10-29T04:42:55  <janzert> wish_: top, left is 0, 0 they increase going down and to the right

2011-10-29T04:43:36  <wish_> xD
2011-10-29T04:44:12  <antimatroid1> well where would you think the first row and column is? :P

2011-10-29T04:45:08  <bobbydroptable> well when i think x,y coodinates i actually think of a 2-axis chart with 0,0, on the bottom left.
2011-10-29T04:45:08  <wish_> in mathematics, positive x goes right and positive y goes up
2011-10-29T04:45:14  <wish_> exactly
2011-10-29T04:45:20  <bobbydroptable> which confuses me
2011-10-29T04:45:20  <wish_> that's the convention
2011-10-29T04:45:41  <bobbydroptable> but in most graphic representations 0,0 is top left
2011-10-29T04:45:52  <antimatroid1> don't get me started on graphics programmers :P
2011-10-29T04:45:59  <bobbydroptable> except it goes x,y not row,col
2011-10-29T04:46:33  <bobbydroptable> and since i'm pretty much both of them, i always swap row,col around and go the opposite direction :D
2011-10-29T04:47:12  <antimatroid1> i assure you i'm this stubborn with notation anywhere

2011-10-29T04:49:04  <bobbydroptable> its just a game
2011-10-29T04:49:06  <bobbydroptable> ^^
2011-10-29T04:49:12  <wish_> yeah
2011-10-29T04:49:16  <wish_> but do you know
2011-10-29T04:49:24  <wish_> how long i've been looking for bugs
2011-10-29T04:49:27  <wish_> in my code
2011-10-29T04:49:28  <antimatroid1> i'm not wrong, assuming you have to know one of them like the back of your hand, you need to remember more to do [x][y] indexing and you have to do like minus the cross product to get it right etc.
2011-10-29T04:49:30  <wish_> instead of in the communication
2011-10-29T04:49:34  <wish_> xD
2011-10-29T04:50:06  <bobbydroptable> in wish_'s defense, the origin is not mentioned in the specifications
2011-10-29T04:50:14  <janzert> McLeopold: _SESSION['temp_access'] comes from?
2011-10-29T04:50:30  <McLeopold> forgot_instructions.php
2011-10-29T04:50:32  <bobbydroptable> mmm peanut butter jelly sanwich for dinner'
2011-10-29T04:50:45  <McLeopold> I don't think I set it blank, did I?
2011-10-29T04:50:49  *** wombot__ <wombot__!~chatzilla@222.155.245.180> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-10-29T04:50:51  <antimatroid1> do graphics programmers define matrix multiplication etc. indexing with [x][y]?
2011-10-29T04:50:57  <antimatroid1> that would do my head in :P
2011-10-29T04:51:02  <McLeopold> they do
2011-10-29T04:51:11  <wish_> so
2011-10-29T04:51:22  <wish_> my brain is exploding now
2011-10-29T04:51:25  <wish_> in redoing the pathfinding
2011-10-29T04:51:32  <wish_> with south = +1
2011-10-29T04:51:45  <McLeopold> janzert: I also didn't care to code for double submits
2011-10-29T04:51:46  <antimatroid1> i would go back and fix it up where you're reading it in etc.
2011-10-29T04:51:59  <wish_> that works for row <-> col swapping
2011-10-29T04:52:01  <wish_> not for reading in
2011-10-29T04:52:08  <antimatroid1> if you want to transform it to your own coordinates that's fine, but if you don't do it right at the fundamental level you'll be very prone to bugs
2011-10-29T04:52:11  <antimatroid1> that's my advice anyway
2011-10-29T04:52:13  <wish_> if i send S and expect y to go -1, and it goes +1...
2011-10-29T04:52:15  <janzert> hmm, so if they're logged in you let them change the password without the old password if they go through the password reset first?
2011-10-29T04:52:24  <wish_> i guess i'll just call your south north etc
2011-10-29T04:52:26  <wish_> xD
2011-10-29T04:52:34  <janzert> oh, nevermind I see
2011-10-29T04:52:37  <McLeopold> :)
2011-10-29T04:52:43  <McLeopold> kinda the point of the forget feature
2011-10-29T04:52:45  <antimatroid1> you're setting yourself up for stupid bugs :P

2011-10-29T04:53:05  <janzert> why not have the forgot_password url send them straight to the change_password page?
2011-10-29T04:53:08  <antimatroid1> perhaps in the future we could let the bot tell the engine in turn 0 which coordinate system they want to use?
2011-10-29T04:53:12  <McLeopold> it does

2011-10-29T04:53:40  <McLeopold> it uses a header redirect if the url was correct
2011-10-29T04:53:46  <wish_> maybe you could just change the order to
2011-10-29T04:53:57  <wish_> o from_x from_y to_x to_y
2011-10-29T04:54:51  <janzert> I mean have the url in the email go to aichallenge.org/change_password.php?... and let that page do the code check directly
2011-10-29T04:55:03  <janzert> don't use the redirect and session variable
2011-10-29T04:55:39  <McLeopold> that page is also used for regular password changes
2011-10-29T04:56:36  <janzert> right, but you change the page fields on the session variable being set anyway
2011-10-29T04:56:40  <McLeopold> I'd rather duplicate the change password form on the forgot_instruct page to get rid of the session var

2011-10-29T04:56:52  <janzert> why?
2011-10-29T04:57:15  <McLeopold> so that there is a special page accepting incoming urls for forgetten passwords
2011-10-29T04:57:53  <janzert> there isn't now, it's just overloaded on the instructions page ;)
2011-10-29T04:57:56  <McLeopold> okay, is there a security hole here I'm not understanding?
2011-10-29T04:58:02  <McLeopold> session vars bad?
2011-10-29T04:58:10  <janzert> I'm not really sure
2011-10-29T04:58:21  <janzert> but I don't want to trust it when it's not needed
2011-10-29T04:59:12  <janzert> it seems like a really simple change to change_password.php to handle the whole thing too
2011-10-29T04:59:19  <McLeopold> okay, let me try

2011-10-29T05:00:42  <janzert> just change the if statement checking the session variable to check the url variable exists and then do the database check to make sure it's valid
2011-10-29T05:00:43  <bobbydroptable> depends on what information you're keeping in session
2011-10-29T05:01:47  <janzert> bobbydroptable: can things stuffed into the session in php's default session be maninpulated by the client in any way?
2011-10-29T05:02:05  <bobbydroptable> nope
2011-10-29T05:02:27  <bobbydroptable> but session hijacking is a possibility
2011-10-29T05:02:46  <janzert> ok, it's probably safe but still an unnecessary trust
2011-10-29T05:03:03  <janzert> I just remember some systems actually use cookies to store the information
2011-10-29T05:03:54  <wish_> hm
2011-10-29T05:03:55  <wish_> i think it's working now

2011-10-29T05:04:16  <bobbydroptable> storing information in cookies in plaintext is a bad idea as always
2011-10-29T05:04:46  <janzert> McLeopold: I don't think check_change_password isn't going to work in any case atm
2011-10-29T05:05:20  <bobbydroptable> tbh for something like aichallenge, i doubt anyone's going to bother. what gain would there be :)
2011-10-29T05:05:45  <bobbydroptable> unless someone really hates you
2011-10-29T05:05:47  <janzert> just because it's there
2011-10-29T05:05:58  <janzert> we had someone execute a XSS attack last year
2011-10-29T05:06:34  <McLeopold> janzert: if they forget, I need something in the session to allow multiple attempts to reset without knowing the old
2011-10-29T05:07:02  <McLeopold> otherwise the fat finger the new password, then have to start over with a new email
2011-10-29T05:07:20  <McLeopold> janzert: This is working on my test system
2011-10-29T05:07:45  <wish_> why is my game not showing up on the liiiiist
2011-10-29T05:07:51  <wish_> i wanna watch my ant move :>
2011-10-29T05:08:03  <janzert> hmm, how do they get past the logged in check at the top of change_password and check_change_password?
2011-10-29T05:09:08  <McLeopold> the forget_instructions sets the session vars for being logged in
2011-10-29T05:09:33  <McLeopold> so, they are logged in and can do normal stuff with the current session
2011-10-29T05:09:44  <McLeopold> and the change password doesn't require knowing the old one
2011-10-29T05:10:03  <janzert> I'm blind what lines does it do that on?
2011-10-29T05:10:23  <McLeopold> 36
2011-10-29T05:10:29  <McLeopold> check_credentials_forgot
2011-10-29T05:10:38  <McLeopold> which lives in mysql_login
2011-10-29T05:10:45  <janzert> ahh, I haven't found that definition yet
2011-10-29T05:10:47  <janzert> ok
2011-10-29T05:11:38  <McLeopold> basically, forgetting your password sets up a temp password in the user_cookie table that is valid for 5 minutes
2011-10-29T05:11:45  <janzert> so moving the check to change_password would still work but would have to be before the logged in check
2011-10-29T05:11:49  <McLeopold> it gets you in normally
2011-10-29T05:11:54  <janzert> ok

2011-10-29T05:15:58  <Migi32> hi. I have a question about the rules.
2011-10-29T05:16:00  <Migi32> it says "Maps are limited to at most 200x200 squares"
2011-10-29T05:16:02  <janzert> that'd be shaky I think
2011-10-29T05:16:07  <McLeopold> okay, 2
2011-10-29T05:16:20  <Migi32> does that mean maps are limited to 200 squares in each direction, or to 40000 squares total?
2011-10-29T05:16:29  <McLeopold> Migi32: are you going to create a vortex bot again?
2011-10-29T05:16:49  <Migi32> lol, no. Not yet ;)
2011-10-29T05:16:51  <McLeopold> 200 max for each dim
2011-10-29T05:17:11  <Migi32> ok. Because that rule, if you interpret it literally, means the other one
2011-10-29T05:18:00  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm, forgot.php leaks email addresses
2011-10-29T05:18:09  <janzert> it's the first time we do I believe
2011-10-29T05:18:32  <McLeopold> yeah, I thought of that
2011-10-29T05:18:37  <McLeopold> but what else do I do?

2011-10-29T05:18:47  <janzert> it might be better to just have them enter the username and send it to the registered email
2011-10-29T05:18:56  <janzert> if they aren't the person requesting tell them to ignore
2011-10-29T05:19:04  <janzert> that's what I've seen other systems do
2011-10-29T05:19:16  <McLeopold> google asks for email directly
2011-10-29T05:19:38  <janzert> that's generally the username too for them though right?
2011-10-29T05:19:40  <McLeopold> unless I give a success message no matter what?
2011-10-29T05:19:46  <McLeopold> no
2011-10-29T05:19:54  <McLeopold> I tested them before I wrote this
2011-10-29T05:20:17  <McLeopold> then you don't have users wondering where the email goes
2011-10-29T05:20:21  <janzert> giving a success no matter on email will cause lots of people to complain it's not working
2011-10-29T05:21:01  <McLeopold> I could add a captcha, if it's a concern
2011-10-29T05:21:31  <janzert> how about use just username for now, if it does become a problem we'll add captcha?
2011-10-29T05:21:38  <McLeopold> ok
2011-10-29T05:22:24  <McLeopold> so, if you are temp logged in, how should I go about allowing multiple password resets?
2011-10-29T05:23:02  <McLeopold> or multiple attempts
2011-10-29T05:23:40  <janzert> the cookie is stored in the database with a field specifying it's a forgot cookie isn't it?
2011-10-29T05:23:47  <McLeopold> yes
2011-10-29T05:23:55  <McLeopold> but I deleted it as soon as possible
2011-10-29T05:24:05  <janzert> ahh
2011-10-29T05:24:07  <McLeopold> so once you click the link, it's gone
2011-10-29T05:24:37  <McLeopold> I figured pushing the info to a session var was better than allowing multiple browsers in
2011-10-29T05:27:23  <janzert> so the forgot cookie never is actually set as a cookie?
2011-10-29T05:27:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-10-29T05:27:49  <McLeopold> I just had a nice place to store the data ;)
2011-10-29T05:29:11  <janzert> ok, setting the session variable is probably safe and easiest. Else you could delete the forgot code and then set a temporary cookie that disables the new password requirement.
2011-10-29T05:29:28  <janzert> then just that browser could be used to change the password
2011-10-29T05:29:40  <McLeopold> but, a cookie is trasmitted from browser to server, session var is only at server
2011-10-29T05:29:44  <janzert> but probably not worth the hassle
2011-10-29T05:29:56  <McLeopold> technically, the session cookie is the key to skip the old password at that point
2011-10-29T05:30:20  * janzert nods
2011-10-29T05:31:42  <janzert> I'm convinced, but I still would rather send them straight to change_password and leave all logic there
2011-10-29T05:31:50  <McLeopold> yes
2011-10-29T05:32:00  <McLeopold> or, idealy, a unique url
2011-10-29T05:32:45  <janzert> I'm too opposed to but the code duplication that would cause seems bad
2011-10-29T05:32:52  <janzert> not too opposed
2011-10-29T05:33:49  <janzert> you introduced a typo on the profile page

2011-10-29T05:34:16  <McLeopold> I was trying to figure out how the heck that page works
2011-10-29T05:34:25  <McLeopold> I still try to stay away from that code
2011-10-29T05:34:45  <janzert> also I think the verbiage on login.php link to forgot should be explicit about forgotten password
2011-10-29T05:34:53  <janzert> hehe
2011-10-29T05:35:47  <McLeopold> so, the user id is in the forget link, bad?

2011-10-29T06:01:49  <janzert> btw, if you don't already know the real ip function is trying to find the client's ip if they're behind a proxy

2011-10-29T06:13:13  <McLeopold> your bot can always output anything with a '#' char in front and get ignored
2011-10-29T06:13:31  <McLeopold> I would recommend a shebang '#!' for things you would want saved in the replay

2011-10-29T06:14:14  <McLeopold> and the stream format
2011-10-29T06:14:31  <McLeopold> the visualizer then needs to be able to parse it from both formats
2011-10-29T06:14:58  <McLeopold> you should also be able to add comments to the end of bot commands

2011-10-29T07:30:19  <lericson> the die is cast
2011-10-29T07:31:13  <lericson> the problem with this ai challenge is that it's too much work
2011-10-29T07:31:16  <lericson> i have great ideas
2011-10-29T07:32:06  <isbric> the greater ides shuld not demand that much much of work rather then just letting you win :P
2011-10-29T07:32:14  <grom358> yeah.. its hard.. I so far from complete still
2011-10-29T07:32:40  <isbric> but hey, im getting weird hangs..
2011-10-29T07:32:40  <lericson> i made a bot but just the basic default behavior got my creativity zapped
2011-10-29T07:32:48  <grom358> still can't even battle yet.. like have my ants move in formation to kill and be better off
2011-10-29T07:33:41  <lericson> i had an idea
2011-10-29T07:33:55  <lericson> where you take the population of ants and distribute them along a grid evenly
2011-10-29T07:34:34  <isbric> lericson: if your lazy why not look in to reinforcement learning, thats pritty basic, and you can just leav it to lern itself. not much of coding ofc but :P
2011-10-29T07:34:39  <jab_bott> heh - yes it's very hard... I used to do games programming so coded this kind of thing all the time, but for 6 years now I've been doing other stuff for financial reasons! I'm struggling with basic things like searches, heh
2011-10-29T07:34:50  <lericson> then using the same concept as einsteins general relativity you can have a curved 2d surface so the ants gravitate towards energy (and energy being food, enemies, etc.)
2011-10-29T07:35:25  <jab_bott> actually, even tracking the state of the map is not easy due to the command structure
2011-10-29T07:35:32  <lericson> aye jab_bott
2011-10-29T07:35:36  <lericson> the starter kit sucks

2011-10-29T07:43:11  <lericson> anyway as i said earlier i think the best way to do this is by some sort of gravitation-like force

2011-10-29T07:47:22  <lericson> and modify away
2011-10-29T07:47:37  <lericson> all that is required of you is to make a bot that goes by game specifications
2011-10-29T07:47:38  <jab_bott> ahh ok, I assumed it means compiled python or something like that
2011-10-29T07:47:43  <lericson> which is all controlled via stdin/stdout

2011-10-29T10:26:06  <overburn> hey guys,  i have a small problem with my bot
2011-10-29T10:26:11  <UMPUSTEN> still cant run the play_one_game.cmd...error: the command python dose not exist...im using python 2.7.2 alrdy tryed newer versions still the same error...what am i doing wrong?
2011-10-29T10:26:17  <overburn> it's basically derived from the c++ starter
2011-10-29T10:26:21  <overburn> and when i upload it
2011-10-29T10:26:34  <overburn> o 1 18  # invalid direction
2011-10-29T10:26:48  <overburn> the string should be the same as the starter bot's
2011-10-29T10:26:50  <overburn> which works
2011-10-29T10:26:58  <overburn> aka N E S W
2011-10-29T10:28:08  <overburn> locally it works no problem , but on the server there-s something about the characters

2011-10-29T11:28:11  <luizribeiro> I'm looking for exploration algorithms that can be used. anyone know any?

2011-10-29T11:29:04  <Fluxid> and irclogs
2011-10-29T11:29:18  <cowbandit_> o i got another quick question:
2011-10-29T11:29:26  <cowbandit_> so lets say u use A* for pathing
2011-10-29T11:29:38  <cowbandit_> what happens if the path goes through unexplored territory?
2011-10-29T11:29:42  <luizribeiro> doing all of those already atm. I was just trying to start a discussion about the subject.
2011-10-29T11:29:48  <luizribeiro> looks like I failed miserably, though.
2011-10-29T11:29:56  <Fluxid> cowbandit_: update the path when you explore
2011-10-29T11:30:33  <cowbandit_> ah ok
2011-10-29T11:30:44  <avdg> luizribeiro: we had some discussions few days ago, but maybe it was because some people (including me) had some ideas
2011-10-29T11:30:56  <luizribeiro> avdg: cool. I'll check the logs. :)
2011-10-29T11:33:32  <ump> someone ?
2011-10-29T11:33:53  <grom358> cowbandit: you have to recalculate your path when u get to a wall when going through unexplored territory
2011-10-29T11:34:32  <grom358> cowbandit: to start with you assume that there are no water tiles when A* to unexplored territory

2011-10-29T12:04:44  <stocha> Zao : that doesn't sound very appealling
2011-10-29T12:04:56  <Minthos> the fastest way to test a bot is using one of the scripts in the toolkit

2011-10-29T12:05:07  <grom358> i see some ppl have moving/attacking in formation working.. I wanna know how todo that :/
2011-10-29T12:05:10  <Minthos> if it does well, test it on a tcp server against other bots
2011-10-29T12:05:16  <Zao> And if you run locally, you can attach all kinds of instrumentation to your bots.
2011-10-29T12:05:40  <Minthos> how to do that is described on the forum
2011-10-29T12:05:46  <Zao> Heck, ours has a debug GUI showing a lot of interesting information, and is properly debuggable.

2011-10-29T12:14:14  <antimatroid1> ^5: strategy ideas: defend your hills at all costs, if you can invase an enemy hill before their ants can get to you, go for it, work on how you want to use your ants to collect the food, work out how you'd like to battle enemy ants, explore the map etc.

2011-10-29T12:27:53  <lavalamp> if there is a terrible bot in the game, I do pretty well

2011-10-29T12:29:06  <grom358> I always eat
2011-10-29T12:29:41  <lavalamp> hm. Only my ants "in range" of an enemy hill will try to go there, that might be the difference
2011-10-29T12:29:51  <grom358> lavalamp: no the problem I have.. is each ant does there own thing.. they don't try and walk in formation.. which means my ants can be picked off easy by any bot that has group up for attack code
2011-10-29T12:30:07  <grom358> ah.. yeah I charge for it as soon as I find it
2011-10-29T12:30:08  <lavalamp> grom358: Yeah I totaly have that problem also

2011-10-29T12:37:14  <lavalamp> grom358: yeah, I see. I think you need a better balance between exploring and killing hills. You can't drop everything to kill someone or a third party will stomp on you.
2011-10-29T12:38:11  <avdg> grom358: until you've been pwned by the back :-)
2011-10-29T12:38:24  <grom358> yeah I thinking of making a only attack enemy hill if number of ants is greater than say 50.. just as something simple
2011-10-29T12:38:26  <avdg> nice strategy otherwise

2011-10-29T12:39:07  <avdg> well, it can attack
2011-10-29T12:39:26  <grom358> what do u mean by exploring... just looking for food?

2011-10-29T12:40:43  <grom358> was gonna expand it to check areas not recently visible

2011-10-29T12:43:15  <lavalamp> I'm working on that now

2011-10-29T12:44:10  <grom358> but I don't know enough about AI etc to know how to make the combat
2011-10-29T12:44:14  <wilsone> Hi, I am dealing with really strange behavior where a bot operates fine locally, but won't perform basic moves like get off the ant hill on the server http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=29864&user=4156
2011-10-29T12:44:30  <wilsone> I checked and no messages going to stderr
2011-10-29T12:44:40  <wilsone> works fine on tcp servers too
2011-10-29T12:44:43  <grom358> some sort of swarm logic I thinking I need
2011-10-29T12:44:55  <avdg> grom358: its kinda hard to get a good tactic if you don't have the right intuition about this kind of game
2011-10-29T12:45:23  <wilsone> I am using C++, anyone else been using C++ successfully on the server?
2011-10-29T12:45:38  <avdg> some people are thinking that they can win a game if every ant needs to be smart
2011-10-29T12:45:48  <grom358> I really interested in learning this though.. always wanted too.. so this challenge is my attempt at learning
2011-10-29T12:45:58  <avdg> (while at some level not caring about other ants in their team)
2011-10-29T12:46:29  <^5> I really need to work on this... http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.11979 Im Geoff
2011-10-29T12:46:31  <avdg> grom358: yeah
2011-10-29T12:46:49  <wilsone> @GeorgeJ had suggested maybe stderr was the issue, but removed it all and still happens
2011-10-29T12:46:50  <contestbot> wilsone: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2011-10-29T12:47:20  <avdg> ^5 preventing yourself from stepping over the hill will not reduce your kills ;-)

2011-10-29T12:47:46  <avdg> just try to prevent it by doing it an other way

2011-10-29T12:47:58  <mediocrist> so, i'm fairly new to java, and programming as a whole. I'm trying to implement the A* algorithm but am having issues pulling it together. I understand A*, just having issues in the programming department.
2011-10-29T12:48:02  <mediocrist> any good guides out there
2011-10-29T12:48:04  <mediocrist> ?

2011-10-29T12:57:02  <stocha> is there anyuse for this official server. When it plays 20 games a week per bot ?
2011-10-29T12:57:23  <stocha> not mentionning that maybe a lot of people are not submitting anything yet.
2011-10-29T12:57:37  <stocha> it will go down as time passes.
2011-10-29T12:57:49  <mediocrist> grom358: I'm just learning, so I'm going to start with A*, which seems easier to implement. I want to move onto doing a single BFS for each hill, each food and one BFS for all unexplored areas

2011-10-29T12:58:55  <stocha> are the game specified to be deterministic ? (fixed seed). If yes, you can run it on serverall different point, and compare the result.
2011-10-29T12:59:04  <mediocrist> distributed computing for the aichallenge? like folding@home?
2011-10-29T12:59:09  <mediocrist> cool idea
2011-10-29T12:59:12  <stocha> mediocrist: sure.
2011-10-29T12:59:21  <grom358> fair enough.. but BFS is simpler then A* . Less code.. easier to understand. But yeah A* not too complicated either once you get it
2011-10-29T12:59:43  <stocha> as it is, it really seems far to slow going to be any useful.
2011-10-29T13:00:07  <stocha> then the beta period is over, so maybe it's too late. I don't know where the thing is going though.
2011-10-29T13:00:10  <mediocrist> i'm honestly having issues working with either, I just started learning java 4 days ago. Saw aichallenge yesterday evening.
2011-10-29T13:00:32  <mediocrist> kinda brute forcing my way through this
2011-10-29T13:00:52  <stocha> good way to improve.

2011-10-29T13:11:57  <stocha> what's the official cpu and time ?
2011-10-29T13:12:06  <Fluxid> if it is over network, the time mayb e longer, so turntime must me larger too
2011-10-29T13:12:20  <stocha> vantreeseba: yeah, as cyphase said. Everyone is free to restrain to the official time.
2011-10-29T13:12:27  <vantreeseba> true
2011-10-29T13:12:48  <stocha> still i have no idea what the official cpu and turn time are.
2011-10-29T13:12:59  <stocha> is that even hinted yet ?
2011-10-29T13:13:06  <cyphase> stocha, 3000ms loadtime, 500ms loadtime
2011-10-29T13:13:12  <cyphase> 500ms turntime*
2011-10-29T13:13:35  <cyphase> i don't know cpu, but ram is 1GB limit
2011-10-29T13:13:40  <stocha> 500ms. Now that is short.  and already games are not exactly flowing.
2011-10-29T13:14:13  <cyphase> they're working on it
2011-10-29T13:14:15  <stocha> I understand why it's called a challenge now.
2011-10-29T13:14:23  <stocha> what it the game rate on the tcp server ?
2011-10-29T13:14:23  <cyphase> speeding up the servers
2011-10-29T13:14:46  <stocha> @tcp

2011-10-29T13:17:00  <vantreeseba> That, I don't know.
2011-10-29T13:17:07  <cyphase> probably very close, but dont count on it
2011-10-29T13:17:54  <stocha> okay. let's head to tcp, and see how things go there then. my wife will not be happy if i let the pc run all days :p
2011-10-29T13:19:15  <Minthos> your computer still needs to run for your bot to fight on a tcp server
2011-10-29T13:19:23  <Minthos> hence the 'tcp' part
2011-10-29T13:19:44  <stocha> yeah. so you need either be rich, or not have a wife.
2011-10-29T13:19:55  <vantreeseba> lol, I have 3 pc'
2011-10-29T13:19:58  <vantreeseba> s that run all the time
2011-10-29T13:20:17  <stocha> i have a wife and two little girls. That run all the time.
2011-10-29T13:20:26  <vantreeseba> you'll save more money by changing out your lightbulbs and getting a better ac unit
2011-10-29T13:20:28  <Minthos> dunno about rich, but I'm rich enough to afford a dedicated server in amsterdam
2011-10-29T13:20:45  <stocha> Minthos: how much is it ?
2011-10-29T13:20:45  <vantreeseba> though, electricity here is really cheap, so
2011-10-29T13:20:50  <isbric> McLeopold: there?
2011-10-29T13:21:01  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-10-29T13:21:14  <stocha> Minthos: you can probably rent them from france. what's the price, and http ?
2011-10-29T13:21:17  <Minthos> about EUR 30, I got a pretty nice deal I think
2011-10-29T13:21:34  <vantreeseba> chunkhost can give you a free vps if you do the beta
2011-10-29T13:21:34  <stocha> 30 euro/ month ? what spec ?
2011-10-29T13:21:38  <Minthos> they don't have that offer anymore but look at lowenddedi.net
2011-10-29T13:21:38  <isbric> i read on the formus that you mentioned the --end_wait option, do you know if the game servers uses it?

2011-10-29T13:22:11  <vantreeseba> well, its free while you "beta test" and then its like $15/month
2011-10-29T13:22:13  <Minthos> 100 mbit, 2 GB bandwith/month, 1.8 GHz c2d, 1 GB ram, 250 GB hdd
2011-10-29T13:22:37  <stocha> let me check how much it is here in france
2011-10-29T13:24:08  <vantreeseba> stocha: Just curious, how much is your electricity bill / month there in france?
2011-10-29T13:24:27  <stocha> seems it starts at 50 euros/month (+ setup fee) c2d 2.33mhz 4 gb ram.
2011-10-29T13:24:46  <stocha> vantreeseba: ... i have no idea.
2011-10-29T13:25:01  <stocha> vantreeseba: i'll try to have a look at the official site :p
2011-10-29T13:25:10  <vantreeseba> stocha: lol
2011-10-29T13:25:49  <stocha> it's about 0,13 per kilo watt hour.
2011-10-29T13:25:53  <stocha> 0,13 euro
2011-10-29T13:26:08  <vantreeseba> stocha: wow, just curious
2011-10-29T13:26:21  <stocha> how much is it in your country ?

2011-10-29T13:27:06  <minus> germany
2011-10-29T13:27:12  <avdg> I think its expensive here, but I have no idea actually
2011-10-29T13:27:48  <avdg> (problems with electricity network raises prices)
2011-10-29T13:27:57  <stocha> there may be additionnal though. like a price you have to pay even if you don't drink any kwh at all.
2011-10-29T13:28:06  <avdg> and almost nobody knows about these problems
2011-10-29T13:28:08  <jbroman> Ontario: varies from 5.9 cents/kWh (off-peak) to 10.7 cents/kWh (peak hours).
2011-10-29T13:28:20  <vantreeseba> stocha: there is, my average bill is usually like $80/month
2011-10-29T13:28:40  <stocha> i don't look at my electricity bill.
2011-10-29T13:28:52  <stocha> don't know where wife put it.
2011-10-29T13:29:25  <vantreeseba> stocha: ah, well, its cheap right now, cause temperature cooled down, but this summer, it was almost 48C for 3 weeks, so air conditioning was expensive
2011-10-29T13:29:32  <stocha> dedicated server is probably the way to go. But even 30 euros per month, would be like 100 euros for 3 month + setup costs.

2011-10-29T13:30:43  <stocha> one for 10 bots; with core2duo might make it acceptable.
2011-10-29T13:30:55  <Minthos> you can get a vps much cheaper, should do the trick
2011-10-29T13:30:59  <stocha> it would go down to maybe 20 euros for 3 month then.
2011-10-29T13:31:06  <stocha> what's vps ?
2011-10-29T13:31:12  <vantreeseba> virtual private server
2011-10-29T13:31:19  <vantreeseba> its like a dedicated VM, runs on xen
2011-10-29T13:31:24  <Minthos> shared server with guaranteed cpu and ram
2011-10-29T13:31:26  <vantreeseba> lol
2011-10-29T13:31:27  <stocha> i had a lot of trouble with those a few years back.
2011-10-29T13:31:35  <vantreeseba> chunkhost.com has free ones for a month or so if you do the beta

2011-10-29T13:32:39  <vantreeseba> they are are in L.A. california I think
2011-10-29T13:32:54  <vantreeseba> I had a little bit of down time, but they gave me a free month
2011-10-29T13:32:56  <stocha> ah chunkhost. but it's a beta.
2011-10-29T13:32:59  <vantreeseba> I've never lost data
2011-10-29T13:33:16  <stocha> what's the http ?
2011-10-29T13:33:20  <vantreeseba> chunkhost.com
2011-10-29T13:34:37  <vantreeseba> though, I think backups are always, always a good idea, IIRC backblaze allows you to do unlimited backups for like $4/month
2011-10-29T13:35:59  <stocha> they seems to cost even more than dedicated though.

2011-10-29T13:42:12  <vantreeseba> its given to you in the state of the game, the bot input section on http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#Bot-Input should help explain that

2011-10-29T13:42:36  <mediocrist> awesome, thanks

2011-10-29T13:43:46  <Minthos> I'm just in this for fame and glory (and fun, and a prize if there is one of course)
2011-10-29T13:44:09  <vantreeseba> cool
2011-10-29T13:44:39  <stocha> if the thing was appealing, i'd try to grab the fame for sure. But i don't know. I already have a bot from old beta. I never bothered to implement the new combat algorithm though.
2011-10-29T13:44:59  <stocha> not to mention the hive.
2011-10-29T13:45:03  <vantreeseba> btw, if you guys are interested in starcraft (the original one) there is a ai challenge for it hosted by UC Santa Cruz every year as well, there are some programs for grabbing and pushing input and etc into and out of the starcraft game
2011-10-29T13:45:25  <vantreeseba> I was gonna do it, but I got lazy
2011-10-29T13:45:26  <stocha> interesting.
2011-10-29T13:45:42  <stocha> but the game lack simlicity
2011-10-29T13:45:55  <stocha> i think i'd better finish my go playing engine.
2011-10-29T13:46:01  <stocha> finish starting it that is.
2011-10-29T13:46:12  <vantreeseba> yea, the bot that won was pretty interesting, it used vector flow fields to guide its units
2011-10-29T13:46:19  <stocha> at least the game has straight forward rules.
2011-10-29T13:46:47  <stocha> vantreeseba: interesting. So it is a widely used technique
2011-10-29T13:47:03  <stocha> i saw a early ant bot that used that. At least the guy wanted to use it.
2011-10-29T13:47:10  <vantreeseba> ah, yea, makes sense
2011-10-29T13:47:19  <stocha> i was amazed at non integer speed for ants.
2011-10-29T13:47:28  <stocha> i would never had dreamed of trying it :p
2011-10-29T13:48:08  <karoitay> I am trying to run my bot in the tcp severs, the command line window looks fine but - in some of the servers it says that I played 0 games (even thoug I ran tcpclient.py on them) and on one server I do see the games but for some reason my ants does not move. (the do move on aichallenge games
2011-10-29T13:48:10  <karoitay> )
2011-10-29T13:48:14  <stocha> maybe because i'm pretty sure it can't be optimal

2011-10-29T14:40:40  <Daverd> Is there something more to this than "./test_bot.sh MyBot.py3 " ?
2011-10-29T14:41:04  <amstan> i think you need to throw a python in there
2011-10-29T14:41:24  <Daverd> in where

2011-10-29T14:42:45  <Daverd> Didn't change anything. It's complaining that line 313 of playgame.py is passing an argument into the constructor of Ants, and Ants is not set up to accept any args in its constructor
2011-10-29T14:42:54  <Daverd> and I didn't touch any of that
2011-10-29T14:43:30  <amstan> Ants constructor from tools?
2011-10-29T14:43:56  <amstan> right.. i think the tools don't like python3 stuff, since python3 is not backwards compatible
2011-10-29T14:44:13  <amstan> you'll need to run your tools with python2 and your bot(if you want) with python3
2011-10-29T14:45:14  <Daverd> I think that's what I'm doing currently

2011-10-29T14:47:32  <Daverd> I've been modifying that file for my bot
2011-10-29T14:48:55  <Daverd> and geez, the tools ants.py is way different from the starter kit ants.py
2011-10-29T14:50:20  <g0llum> Daverd, there's 2 totally different files named ants.py, one is the game engine, another the state/helper for the bot

2011-10-29T14:51:22  <Daverd> that is really confusing.

2011-10-29T14:55:42  <jab_bott> This is an unmodified clone of the repo - I've been messing with some files in my tools dir but then I figured I should do it in a version-controlled manner so I can easily share the changes
2011-10-29T14:56:27  <jab_bott> Zannick: yeah - that looks like the issue, dunno what caused it, I have to re-learn sed every time I use it :P
2011-10-29T14:57:40  <Daverd> Okay, finally got that all ironed out. Yeah, I'm getting the same test case error when I run it locally.
2011-10-29T14:57:40  <amstan> jab_bott: that sed replaces tall dist/ with nothing

2011-10-29T15:02:44  <jab_bott> if I can get the tools building from the source then I can modify, re-deploy locally and test :)
2011-10-29T15:03:03  <amstan> jab_bott: you can use the tools as they are in the repo
2011-10-29T15:03:08  <amstan> you don't have to makefile them
2011-10-29T15:03:13  <jab_bott> well 'building' is a bit strong considering the makefile mostly copies and zips stuff :D
2011-10-29T15:03:17  <amstan> yeah
2011-10-29T15:03:23  <amstan> it just packages them

2011-10-29T15:35:38  <thestinger> how many times are you running it?
2011-10-29T15:35:45  <thestinger> I don't use BFS like I used A*
2011-10-29T15:36:01  <synace> once per 'target' (hill, food)
2011-10-29T15:36:27  <thestinger> you probably can't do it for each food in php
2011-10-29T15:36:46  <thestinger> well, you can share 1 distance map for all the hills, and 1 for exploration
2011-10-29T15:37:11  <thestinger> for food I do 1 per food, but it takes ~12ms sometimes to do it for every food, and I'm using C++
2011-10-29T15:37:31  <thestinger> so in python/php that would take 30x to 60x longer
2011-10-29T15:38:04  <synace> ~290ms per food
2011-10-29T15:38:19  <thestinger> well, you can probably optimize it then
2011-10-29T15:38:35  <thestinger> it takes me than than 0.5ms per food (sometimes there is a lot of food)
2011-10-29T15:39:35  <thestinger> a big optimization for mine was not keeping track of visited nodes like a regular BFS, because I would stop as soon as the new distance wasn't less than the old distance on the map
2011-10-29T15:39:53  <synace> i'm also weighting the map though i could ty w/o that
2011-10-29T15:40:51  <avdg> I think there is a way to calculate things faster and its pretty simple
2011-10-29T15:40:57  <avdg> but it requires some code rewrite
2011-10-29T15:41:06  <avdg> but I forgot it atm
2011-10-29T15:41:40  <thestinger> oh, php's array is really an ordered dictionary
2011-10-29T15:41:45  <thestinger> that's probably killing your speed
2011-10-29T15:42:17  <synace> yeah.. w/o weighting i'm down to 150ms

2011-10-29T15:42:57  <avdg> found it
2011-10-29T15:43:14  <thestinger> I'm using 3 preallocated 2d arrays of ints (1 for food, 1 for hills, 1 for exploration)
2011-10-29T15:43:34  <thestinger> I do all the hills at the same time, so ants attack the nearest hill (same thing for exploration)
2011-10-29T15:43:42  <synace> avdg: i saw a nice comparison of spl vs scalars, depending on the use, spl can be faster
2011-10-29T15:43:50  <thestinger> for food, I reset the vector and redo it for each food

2011-10-29T15:52:06  <thestinger> yeah, I did know a fair bit of C before doing this but the C++ stuff is all new to me
2011-10-29T15:52:14  <thestinger> there's no way I would have tried doing it in C :P
2011-10-29T15:53:19  <synace> python could be interesting
2011-10-29T15:53:46  <thestinger> yeah, I started in python
2011-10-29T15:54:09  <thestinger> if you use py2 I'm pretty sure you can use numpy

2011-10-29T16:04:30  <thestinger> I'm actually finding it a lot easier than I thought it would be to use C++ for this, the standard library has _almost_ all the data structures and stuff that I would be using in python
2011-10-29T16:05:12  <thestinger> C++0x has unordered_set and unordered_map which are the two things I'm missing that are in python, so hopefully support gets added for using -std=c++0x

2011-10-29T16:12:54  <thestinger> nice
2011-10-29T16:13:49  <synace> i'd like to reuse the map between turns, but i want to weight the map based other obstructions
2011-10-29T16:14:01  <thestinger> do you reuse this food map for all the ants?
2011-10-29T16:14:17  <synace> yeah, per food
2011-10-29T16:14:30  <synace> but i intend to rebuild per turn too
2011-10-29T16:14:36  <synace> so, i am atm
2011-10-29T16:14:45  <thestinger> yeah, that's how I do it
2011-10-29T16:15:12  <synace> i have to figure something out other than arrays then.. slow performance
2011-10-29T16:15:13  <thestinger> I was originally planning to use a BFS search just to measure distance to find the closest ant, but it makes sense to reuse it for pathfinding too
2011-10-29T16:15:23  <synace> yeah, it's good enough
2011-10-29T16:15:27  <synace> especially if you can weight it
2011-10-29T16:15:48  <synace> -1 for friendly -2 for enemy +1 for food along the way, etc
2011-10-29T16:16:19  <synace> *-1
2011-10-29T16:16:21  <synace> lol
2011-10-29T16:16:39  <thestinger> it's actually faster for me to make the entire BFS distance map for a food than to calculate manhattan distance
2011-10-29T16:16:59  <synace> not sure why my map is taking so long to calc
2011-10-29T16:17:31  <synace> using arrays & isset, and a queue stack
2011-10-29T16:17:32  <thestinger> well I mean making the distance is map is faster than calculating manhattan distance for _each_ ant
2011-10-29T16:17:34  <lavalamp> thestinger: how are you calculating manhattan distance to make that the case?
2011-10-29T16:17:41  <synace> probably need to pass the point arrays by reference
2011-10-29T16:18:08  <lavalamp> oh, I see what you mean
2011-10-29T16:18:18  <thestinger> and it gets me free pathfinding :)
2011-10-29T16:18:47  <thestinger> I'll still probably end up using the A* algorithm I coded, but not for food/hill attacking/exploration

2011-10-29T16:37:05  <neekl> can anyone help me ? (sorry i forgot to ask ^^)
2011-10-29T16:37:25  <jab_bott> avdg: actually it's more a git config question - if I can have a different setting for this repo
2011-10-29T16:37:30  <avdg> jab_bott: but you can however change the settings for a local repo
2011-10-29T16:37:40  <avdg> check the .git folder
2011-10-29T16:38:32  <avdg> there is a file called config

2011-10-29T17:19:16  <jab_bott> pgoldbr: think about the focus-based attack settling mechanism - a square will be vulnerable at the corners, a circle will be vulnerable because it's smaller than an encroaching circle from attacking ants... so you really need to adapt your defence according to the attack formation of the enemy if you want a good one :P
2011-10-29T17:19:19  <neekl> Fandekasp: salut adri

2011-10-29T17:28:55  <jmcarthur> avdg: minimal and tiling window managers often make multiple apps seem more cohesive
2011-10-29T17:29:01  <Fluxid> avdg: what do you mean exactly
2011-10-29T17:29:05  <avdg> nvm
2011-10-29T17:29:43  <thestinger> i3 keeps floating windows on a higher layer than tiled ones, and I think wmii and dwm do the same
2011-10-29T17:30:00  <Fluxid> thestinger: same case here
2011-10-29T17:30:02  <jmcarthur> Fluxid: so is that an accordian layout of some sort. i see tab-like things as the top
2011-10-29T17:30:17  <jmcarthur> xmonad does that with floating windows as well
2011-10-29T17:30:21  <Fluxid> more like stacks, wmii doesn't have tabs
2011-10-29T17:30:30  <Fluxid> wmii has columns of stacked windows
2011-10-29T17:30:36  <jmcarthur> yeah that i think is also what i meant
2011-10-29T17:30:40  <Fluxid> :)
2011-10-29T17:30:51  <Fluxid> and it works well with multiple monitors
2011-10-29T17:30:59  <jmcarthur> xmonad can do that
2011-10-29T17:31:14  <Fluxid> many people read on some old forum threads wmii doesn't support xrandr/xinerama/multihead in general
2011-10-29T17:31:20  <Fluxid> but it works really well
2011-10-29T17:31:29  <jmcarthur> yeah i would be surprised if i read that

2011-10-29T17:33:21  <Fluxid> 500ms now
2011-10-29T17:33:25  <Migi32> oh
2011-10-29T17:33:38  <Migi32> good that I asked then :P
2011-10-29T17:33:50  <jmcarthur> Migi32: it is told at the beginning of each game
2011-10-29T17:33:55  <jmcarthur> in the parameters
2011-10-29T17:34:14  <jmcarthur> and you can see it from replays by clicking on the bot input button
2011-10-29T17:35:34  <Migi32> ok. Thanks.
2011-10-29T17:36:51  <Migi32> is it always going to be 500ms or can this parameter still change? I ask because not all algorithms can break early if time is running out, and need a certain time to complete. If that turntime parameter is less than what your algoritm needs, you're screwed :)
2011-10-29T17:37:32  <amstan> Migi32: i think it's specified when the game starts
2011-10-29T17:37:40  <amstan> so if it does change, you can hook it up to that
2011-10-29T17:38:08  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i would recommend reading it in at the start and running a timer with a fallback in case your main algorithm is about to time out
2011-10-29T17:38:39  <jmcarthur> Migi32: and if applicable, adjusting parameters in your algorithm depending on the time available

2011-10-29T17:38:58  <jmcarthur> ah yeah
2011-10-29T17:39:08  <amstan> Migi32: it's probably going to stay 500ms
2011-10-29T17:39:11  <jmcarthur> i don't know if such a limit is specified, but i agree it would be nice to have
2011-10-29T17:39:16  <Migi32> extreme example: if you say turntime = 1ms, you will need completely different algorithms
2011-10-29T17:39:53  <jmcarthur> games would so much faster! ;)

2011-10-29T18:44:36  <jab_bott> hrm - I'm just looking why there's no switch in python, and the suggested alternative is a dictionary - but do the various values in the dict get processed - i.e. all of them are processed? or are they only processed when accessed and therefore only one will be processed?
2011-10-29T18:45:28  <_flag> I would be fairly sure that it's not my problem, but they seem to happen just often enough that I'm not entirely sure

2011-10-29T18:45:47  <jab_bott> thestinger: yeah, that :)
2011-10-29T18:46:09  <minus> switch is not much different from a couple of if/ else ifs

2011-10-29T18:46:29  <thestinger> well if you do {}.get(key)() it will only run the function that it gets
2011-10-29T18:46:41  <jab_bott> thestinger: I see
2011-10-29T18:47:21  <thestinger> you can also {}.get(key, default), which is more like a switch but without fallthrough

2011-10-29T18:49:42  <thestinger> you could make it a lot simpler by moving the actual function/method call outside of the function

2011-10-29T18:59:59  <Savaron> thats unfortunate ;)
2011-10-29T19:00:15  <thestinger> well, you could figure out the direction without wrapping, and then handle wrapping of the direction when you do something with it
2011-10-29T19:00:25  <thestinger> you get rows/cols at the start of the game though
2011-10-29T19:01:41  <Savaron> sure, but it would be nicer the other way ;)
2011-10-29T19:01:55  <jab_bott> why does invalid.append((line, 'unknown action')) have double brackets?
2011-10-29T19:02:40  <thestinger> t = 'a', 'b' becomes a tuple, you need () in a function call as separators

2011-10-29T19:10:53  <jab_bott> thestinger: or are you saying it's the same but the () around the tuple for consistency?
2011-10-29T19:11:13  <thestinger> append(line, 's') gives append two arguments, which is invalid
2011-10-29T19:11:13  <janzert> no, the append call would raise an exception since it expects only one argument
2011-10-29T19:11:41  <jab_bott> ahh ok - so it's to force it to be processed as a tuple
2011-10-29T19:11:55  * janzert is not disagreeing with thestinger ;)
2011-10-29T19:11:58  <jab_bott> and x = a, b is a short-hand that doesn't need a force?
2011-10-29T19:12:12  * janzert nods
2011-10-29T19:12:17  <thestinger> yeah, but you pretty much need () everywhere
2011-10-29T19:12:39  <thestinger> btw, (1) is not a tuple - you need (1,) because the () is just to separate it basically
2011-10-29T19:12:43  <Fluxid> jab_bott: () is an empty tuple, (1,) is 1-tuple
2011-10-29T19:13:03  <Fluxid> you append a tuple to list, that's why double-paren
2011-10-29T19:13:23  <janzert> jab_bott: btw here's something to think about consider what "a, b = b, a" is doing
2011-10-29T19:13:26  <jab_bott> this python malarky is pretty easy - I'm editing this file without any prior experience just inferring the language from what's already there :D
2011-10-29T19:13:43  <thestinger> you also need () doing something like '5 in (1, 2, 5)'
2011-10-29T19:14:10  <jab_bott> janzert: well it's either swapping them or assigning them both to b, depending on the semantics
2011-10-29T19:14:16  <Fluxid> i like tuples, but i don't like the "option" to add brackets around tuple
2011-10-29T19:14:38  <janzert> it's swapping them, but I meant more the underlying mechanics of it

2011-10-29T19:16:17  <jmcarthur> what the heck is a 1-tuple?
2011-10-29T19:16:36  <Fluxid> tuple with one element
2011-10-29T19:16:40  <janzert> (x,) tuple of length one
2011-10-29T19:16:44  <jab_bott> janzert: well I guess it's making a 2-tuple called a, b and assigning the first component (a) to the first component of another 2-tuple, which is b and the second component to the second component of the same 2-tuple (a)
2011-10-29T19:16:48  <jmcarthur> is it anything other than a value with an extra level of indirection?
2011-10-29T19:16:50  <thestinger> python tuples are used as immutable lists in a lot of cases, you can't use a list as a dict key
2011-10-29T19:18:12  <janzert> jab_bott: more or less but only one tuple is involved, the left hand side doesn't actually create a tuple just unpacks a tuple received into the variables
2011-10-29T19:18:31  <Fluxid> jab_bott: basically, it "packs" variables a and b into tuple, and then "unpacks" tuple into variables b and a, so swaps them
2011-10-29T19:18:56  <jab_bott> ahhhh.. I see the LHS is not a tuple at all
2011-10-29T19:19:06  <Fluxid> in python 3 you can even do something like a, *b, c = list
2011-10-29T19:19:32  <Fluxid> if list is 1, 2, 3, 4  a becomes 1, b becomes (2, 3) and c becomes 4
2011-10-29T19:19:32  <jab_bott> * as-in contents-of?
2011-10-29T19:19:55  <Fluxid> afaik erlang has something similar
2011-10-29T19:20:02  <thestinger> * basically means "everything else"
2011-10-29T19:20:07  <jab_bott> oh.. more like a greedy regex *
2011-10-29T19:20:18  <jmcarthur> huh
2011-10-29T19:20:20  <thestinger> you can have functions that take a variable number of arguments with * and **
2011-10-29T19:20:25  <Fluxid> you can do (a, (b, c)) = (1, (2, 3))
2011-10-29T19:20:41  <Fluxid> while iterating too: for (a, (b, c)) in sequence
2011-10-29T19:20:55  <jmcarthur> * is crazy pattern matching
2011-10-29T19:21:36  <jab_bott> I find in all programming languages you can do this, that, or the other... but it never changes the fact that code should be human-readable so I end up never using any of those features because they're bloody hard to understand unambiguously for a human
2011-10-29T19:23:05  <thestinger> pattern matching is really clear compared to the alternatives
2011-10-29T19:23:14  <Fluxid> i wonder how far can one go with unpacking
2011-10-29T19:24:47  <jmcarthur> unpacking?
2011-10-29T19:24:57  <jmcarthur> oh i need to read above
2011-10-29T19:25:24  <jmcarthur> oh, this pattern matching stuff must be called unpacking in python
2011-10-29T19:25:30  <Fluxid> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/500228/ i knew i could do it but never actually tried it
2011-10-29T19:26:00  <Fluxid> too bad in python3 you cand do def function((a, b), c, (d, (e, f)), *g, **h)
2011-10-29T19:26:03  <thestinger> jmcarthur: yeah, tuple unpacking is like basic pattern matching, py3 adds more features to it like the *
2011-10-29T19:26:07  <Fluxid> in python2 you could afaik
2011-10-29T19:26:30  <jmcarthur> yeah * looks pretty weird. what's **?
2011-10-29T19:26:46  <Fluxid> keywords
2011-10-29T19:26:49  <thestinger> x, *xs = [1,2,3,4]
2011-10-29T19:26:55  <thestinger> so yeah, it's like pattern matching

2011-10-29T19:27:25  <Fluxid> you can do def function(a, **kwargs), and then call it function(a=1, b=2, c=3)
2011-10-29T19:27:32  <jmcarthur> ah

2011-10-29T19:28:28  <Fluxid> also when unpacking, you can unpack any iterable, for exampple a,b,c=range(3)

2011-10-29T19:55:26  <jmcarthur> i think not very likely
2011-10-29T19:56:30  <jmcarthur> i give it a 95% chance of staying at or above 500ms, and a 99% chance of staying above 250ms
2011-10-29T19:56:38  <jmcarthur> (just my own guess)
2011-10-29T19:56:42  <thestinger> I'm actually using 80ms turns for testing my bot atm
2011-10-29T19:57:30  <thestinger> I assume that if I somehow go over 80ms, I have an algorithm that could go over 500ms given the right circumstances
2011-10-29T19:59:21  <jmcarthur> i'm trying something new this year
2011-10-29T19:59:29  <jmcarthur> i'm going to build a visualizer into my bot for debugging
2011-10-29T20:00:54  <jmcarthur> so that unlike with an external visualizer i can actually show things normally put into log files or something
2011-10-29T20:01:18  <jmcarthur> for example, information about the strategy or what my bot thinks the map looks like or where enemies are, etc.
2011-10-29T20:04:03  <jab_bott> jmcarthur: that's what I'm doing now
2011-10-29T20:04:35  <thestinger> yeah, that would be awesome
2011-10-29T20:05:07  <thestinger> I've been using small maps for debugging and printing out a representation of the map to stderr
2011-10-29T20:05:23  <jab_bott> jmcarthur: only I'm using the visualizer that comes with the tools... in addition to the ant-move command (o row col direction) I'm adding a visualizer command (v param1 param2 etc) and that info will be given to the visualizer
2011-10-29T20:05:59  <cyphase> that would be very nice
2011-10-29T20:06:21  <Fluxid> jmcarthur: i thought of visualizer too.. but meh, just dumped shitloads of text into log
2011-10-29T20:06:24  <Fluxid> including maps etc
2011-10-29T20:06:48  <jab_bott> jmcarthur: the visualizer commands will allow you do draw your AI state as an overlay over the real/actual map... this will allow you to compare what your AI thinks to what is really going on, whereas anything you write yourself can only be based on what you think (which might be wrong/buggy, hence the need for debug visualizations)

2011-10-29T20:28:39  <cyphase> ah, interesting. i'd never thought of using _ as a variable name, but i just tried it.. in the interpreter, while something is assigned to it, it returns that, but if you delete it, it'll go back to returning the last returned value

2011-10-29T20:35:17  <jab_bott> [player]it's confusing, so hive_history is the hive value per player per turn.. but what order is it? int value = history[turn][player] <= is that right?
2011-10-29T20:36:34  <thestinger> that's a list comprehension, it makes a list of [0] for each player
2011-10-29T20:36:59  <thestinger> _ is just a name for a variable you don't care about (it's a convention)
2011-10-29T20:37:24  <jab_bott> so a list of [0] is an int array with one element set to 0?

2011-10-29T20:40:08  <jmcarthur> like some vector graphics over the map that kind of express various things about my strategy over time and stuff
2011-10-29T20:40:26  <thestinger> jab_bott: well, I'm not sure how they do it, but they probably append to each of those lists
2011-10-29T20:40:35  <jmcarthur> and as far as comparing reality to what my bot thinks, i can always just run the normal visualizer next to mine
2011-10-29T20:40:36  <thestinger> 0 might represent turn 0
2011-10-29T20:41:08  <jab_bott> jmcarthur: yeah - you can do that with commands... v line x1, y1, x2, y2, r, g, b, a ... v circle x, y, radius, fill, colour, line_thickness ... etc. ?
2011-10-29T20:42:26  <jmcarthur> doing it natively comes with the advantage that i don't have to pipe drawing commands through my bot's output
2011-10-29T20:42:54  <jab_bott> fair enough :)
2011-10-29T20:43:34  <jmcarthur> also allows me to do crazier things like save animations to view later or export images that kind of summarize the game, etc.
2011-10-29T20:44:08  <jab_bott> I suppose any bot could just write out a load of png files and get ffmpeg to make them into a movie :D
2011-10-29T20:45:14  <jmcarthur> right
2011-10-29T20:45:35  <jab_bott> will you have conditional code that compiles out for submission, or use an environment variable to turn it on, or something like that?

2011-10-29T21:10:30  <Antimony> does anyone know any good algorithms for fighting tactics?
2011-10-29T21:10:50  <emilk> I'm currently going with "run for your life"
2011-10-29T21:10:55  <Antimony> lol
2011-10-29T21:11:00  <emilk> it's not a winner
2011-10-29T21:11:08  <Antimony> the hard part is taking into account the enemy moves
2011-10-29T21:11:16  <Antimony> since there are potentially an exponential number of cases
2011-10-29T21:11:23  <avdg> meh, I was thinking "recursion recursion recursion" or that I was seeing something double
2011-10-29T21:11:24  <Minthos> I love playing games where A isn't playing
2011-10-29T21:11:24  <Antimony> if lots of enemy ants are within range

2011-10-29T21:11:59  <emilk> solving it perfectly is indeed exponential
2011-10-29T21:12:06  <Antimony> I'm tempted to jsut code it as if all enemy ants are stationary, but I'll probably get owned
2011-10-29T21:12:37  <emilk> haven't given it much though yet; just got path finding and ant coordination working nicely... maybe tomorrow
2011-10-29T21:12:49  <emilk> but it's a tough problem for sure
2011-10-29T21:12:58  <Antimony> what do you mean by coordination? A lack of crashing into each other?
2011-10-29T21:13:03  <emilk> yeah
2011-10-29T21:13:12  <Antimony> I'm pretty much at the same point
2011-10-29T21:13:22  <Antimony> my ants don't crash and they're pretty good at food gathering
2011-10-29T21:13:28  <Antimony> but I have no idea how to make them fight

2011-10-29T21:17:32  <bobbydroptable> well i got to draw a line somewhere sometime soon
2011-10-29T21:17:37  <thestinger> I'm concentrating on ant flow/swarming atm
2011-10-29T21:17:45  <emilk> my team mate got some nice remote debugging going... or so he says
2011-10-29T21:17:46  <bobbydroptable> ants are fun, but they don't put food on the table
2011-10-29T21:17:48  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-29T21:17:49  <Antimony> there's got to be a good way to do fighting. If xathis can do it, so can we!
2011-10-29T21:18:22  <thestinger> I don't let my ants move into a location that is a) water/my hill b) a place I've already ordered an ant c) a place containing an idle ant (no order)
2011-10-29T21:18:32  <emilk> bobbydroptable: I for one welcome our ant overlords.
2011-10-29T21:18:39  <thestinger> so I have to record when I couldn't step somewhere due to an idle ant and go back and retry that stuff
2011-10-29T21:18:46  <thestinger> it's working well so far :)
2011-10-29T21:18:52  <Antimony> Mine is more or less the same excpet that I have no idle ants and only do one pass
2011-10-29T21:19:18  <thestinger> I tried assuming that all my ants would move, but then I got collisions in big groups
2011-10-29T21:19:25  <bobbydroptable> i have a queue that i pop ants off and then if action fails i just put them at the back of the queue
2011-10-29T21:19:34  <bobbydroptable> then iterate through the queue until empty or out of time
2011-10-29T21:19:35  <Antimony> I have an old set and a new set
2011-10-29T21:19:44  <Antimony> old set is old positions and new set is new positions
2011-10-29T21:19:53  <Antimony> when I move an ant, I remove from old set and add new location to new set
2011-10-29T21:20:04  <Antimony> and then I prevent any move into a location that's in either set
2011-10-29T21:20:09  <thestinger> bobbydroptable: that's basically what I'm doing
2011-10-29T21:20:25  <Antimony> so if an ant already moved that turn, you can move into it's square
2011-10-29T21:20:27  <emilk> my ants support fallback movement, if their original desire was denied.. pretty nice for mass migrations
2011-10-29T21:20:49  <thestinger> yeah I have that too
2011-10-29T21:21:01  <emilk> still some issues with some ants having no where to go, but with some extra passes that should be a very rare problem
2011-10-29T21:21:15  <thestinger> my ants try moving in each direction that brings them closer to their target
2011-10-29T21:21:32  *** goffrie <goffrie!~goffrie@69-196-155-195.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-29T21:21:35  <emilk> exactly
2011-10-29T21:21:48  <thestinger> if they aren't successful and some directions were blocked by currently idle ants, I save them in a blocked list
2011-10-29T21:22:03  <thestinger> well I save the ant location + directions that were tried but blocked by idle ants
2011-10-29T21:22:32  <emilk> I push idle ants =)
2011-10-29T21:22:37  <Antimony> It's basically a cosntraint optimization problem, if you try to move multiple ants at once
2011-10-29T21:22:46  <Antimony> constraint = ant's can't collide
2011-10-29T21:22:56  <Antimony> optimization function is summed distance to targets
2011-10-29T21:23:06  <Antimony> but I'
2011-10-29T21:23:14  <Antimony> I've never tried to implement that before though
2011-10-29T21:23:21  <thestinger> yeah, I'm using C++ so I'll just do it brute-force style - if I go through an iteration of the blocked ants where I don't move any I'll stop iterating
2011-10-29T21:23:31  <thestinger> if that ends up taking too long then I'll worry about optimizing it
2011-10-29T21:23:34  <emilk> there is a cool thing that can be done which I don't at the moment... switching ant objectives. that would resolve a lot of collision issues
2011-10-29T21:23:45  <emilk> but anyway, this is hardly the bottleneck of my ants at the moment
2011-10-29T21:23:47  <bobbydroptable> exactly. concept first, optimize later
2011-10-29T21:23:55  <emilk> not being able to fight is a bit more serious =)
2011-10-29T21:24:12  <thestinger> well, I plan on dealing with all these basics before worrying about fighting :P
2011-10-29T21:24:21  <bobbydroptable> emilk brute forcing your way through is a valid attack plan 90% of the time
2011-10-29T21:24:41  <Antimony> well I think a lot of the stuff like swarming is closely related to fighting
2011-10-29T21:24:44  <emilk> as long as your ants don't arrive one at the time
2011-10-29T21:24:48  <bobbydroptable> yeh
2011-10-29T21:24:49  <Antimony> so I'm trying to solve fighting fist
2011-10-29T21:25:03  <thestinger> yeah, I'm trying to get my ants to move as a close-knit group by doing this
2011-10-29T21:25:13  <thestinger> atm they develop gaps in between them due to collision avoidance
2011-10-29T21:25:49  <emilk> anyway, need to shut down the old brain for a few hours. nice talkign to you gents.
2011-10-29T21:26:04  <Antimony> good night

2011-10-29T21:36:39  <bluemanshoe> right, I was just wondering, seeing as you only get fed the water information the first time you see it
2011-10-29T21:36:48  <bluemanshoe> are all of the walls water, or they hills on the default maps?
2011-10-29T21:36:48  <jab_bott> in python is it valid to do a load of empty if statements - i.e. all on the same indent?
2011-10-29T21:37:30  <avdg> jab_bott: not sure, but I think you have to give it a "pass"

2011-10-29T21:47:57  <bluemanshoe> avdg: so if there was some epic battle between players B and C, everyone died and some turns later you wonder over to the graveyard, you'd see a done of dead ants?
2011-10-29T21:47:58  <avdg> oh, it saves me some checks
2011-10-29T21:47:59  <thestinger> I'm not really sure what you can learn from it though that's useful
2011-10-29T21:48:27  <avdg> bluemanshoe: if you missed it, you won't see it
2011-10-29T21:48:30  <jmcarthur> jab_bott: well, say i know an enemy ant is just outside my viewing range and then i see on the next turn that there is a dead ant at the edge of my viewing range
2011-10-29T21:48:39  <jab_bott> thestinger: that eval thing will make my code a lot easier I think :)
2011-10-29T21:48:48  <jmcarthur> jab_bott: that means there is a chance that the ant i knew about it now dead for some reason
2011-10-29T21:48:49  <bmh> jmcarthur: good ol' probabilistic anty models
2011-10-29T21:49:00  <jmcarthur> *is now
2011-10-29T21:49:15  <jmcarthur> but i think it might be hard information to take advantage of, and with little payoff
2011-10-29T21:49:19  <thestinger> jab_bott: eval() on strings you got over HTTP/whatever pretty much limits you to running it locally though
2011-10-29T21:49:30  <jab_bott> jmcarthur: ahh I see - so you know there's more than one player's ants in that location so you could let them battle it out for a bit ;)(
2011-10-29T21:49:36  <jmcarthur> or something
2011-10-29T21:49:39  <thestinger> jab_bott: I guess you could send the JSON over https
2011-10-29T21:50:12  <bluemanshoe> avdg: so dead ants only last a turn then?
2011-10-29T21:50:16  <jab_bott> thestinger: yeah it will run on output from people's bots in the visualizer
2011-10-29T21:50:41  <avdg> bluemanshoe: like almost every single piece of information, yes

2011-10-29T21:52:21  <ThereWillBeBlood> Anyone know whether they prohibit a process from sending data from your bot out to an external machine? - I would like to setup the bot to send a diagnostic message via email or something.

2011-10-29T21:52:39  <jmcarthur> ThereWillBeBlood: that is against the rules
2011-10-29T21:52:47  <jab_bott> I don't think I'm going to do that well in this challenge, based on you lot talking about all these clever AI things that I've never heard of... but I'm doing ai-class.com atm, so maybe I will learn about some of them :)
2011-10-29T21:52:48  <bmh> jmcarthur: for computing min-cuts and stuff of that nature
2011-10-29T21:52:59  <avdg> jab_bott: I receive duplicated data
2011-10-29T21:53:05  <bmh> ThereWillBeBlood: yes. No dialing out.
2011-10-29T21:53:09  <jmcarthur> ThereWillBeBlood: huh, but you're right that the site doesn't say so
2011-10-29T21:53:11  <ThereWillBeBlood> @jmcarthur: Thanks
2011-10-29T21:53:11  <contestbot> ThereWillBeBlood: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2011-10-29T21:53:17  <jmcarthur> ThereWillBeBlood: but yeah, past contests have ruled that out
2011-10-29T21:53:26  <avdg> jab_bott: oh, I'm looking it wrong
2011-10-29T21:54:02  <jmcarthur> bmh: ah. i have not done anything like that
2011-10-29T21:54:19  <burny> if you can communicate with an external source.. then you can cheat
2011-10-29T21:54:30  <ThereWillBeBlood> how so ?
2011-10-29T21:54:39  <burny> even if it's one way communication, you can still abuse it, to get some data back
2011-10-29T21:54:44  <ThereWillBeBlood> with multiple bots in teh same game maybe
2011-10-29T21:54:54  <ThereWillBeBlood> well - ya - that is kind of the point

2011-10-29T21:55:06  <jmcarthur> ThereWillBeBlood: you could communicate with a supercomputer that does complicated computations on behalf of your bot
2011-10-29T21:55:21  <burny> for example, if you're sending Emails.. you can modify IP address of the host, to send data back

2011-10-29T21:57:05  <Islacrusez> right
2011-10-29T21:57:12  * Islacrusez goes to look if he can figure it out from there
2011-10-29T21:57:20  <devnull_> the only way to send data without able to cheat would be to buffer your output and send it at the end of the game :O
2011-10-29T21:57:51  <bmh> jmcarthur: my team joked about taking the supercomputer route
2011-10-29T21:58:01  <jmcarthur> if you want debugging data then you should probably be playing on the tcp stuff

2011-10-29T22:05:47  <jab_bott> so useful! thanks bmh - I'm getting used to py a bit now
2011-10-29T22:06:14  <jab_bott> I always forget about interpreted languages - it's so easy to test a quick thing
2011-10-29T22:06:17  <bmh> jab_bott: I can't tell if that's sarcasm :)  but really -- play around in the interpreter, it's a great way to learn
2011-10-29T22:06:21  <bmh> hooray :)
2011-10-29T22:06:58  <jab_bott> bmh: nah not sarky - I've been doing python for about um.. 5 hours now - total!
2011-10-29T22:07:10  <cyphase> i often start the python shell when i need to calculate something one-off
2011-10-29T22:07:16  <bmh> That's more python than I ever want to write.
2011-10-29T22:07:17  <Antimony> My ants no longer commit ritual suicide
2011-10-29T22:07:22  <jab_bott> bmh: and not even learning it properly, just editing the ants.py code and learning from what's already there
2011-10-29T22:07:22  <cyphase> i rarely use the calculator program
2011-10-29T22:07:44  <Antimony> but I don't do any magic
2011-10-29T22:07:55  <Islacrusez> cyphase, would you happen to know if/how I can get my bot to print the locations of my live ants?
2011-10-29T22:07:56  <bmh> I don't do any magic yet.
2011-10-29T22:08:20  <Antimony> I'm trying to figure out a good way to do fight planning
2011-10-29T22:08:21  <cyphase> Islacrusez, that would depend on your bot.. but you et the location of your live ants every turn
2011-10-29T22:08:28  <Antimony> or at least react to enemies
2011-10-29T22:08:28  <jab_bott> Islacrusez: I'm working on an extension to the visualizer so that you can draw lines and circles and stuff over the top of the game board by sending out extra commands
2011-10-29T22:08:29  <cyphase> Islacrusez, are you using the ants.py in the starter package?
2011-10-29T22:09:13  <Islacrusez> ironically I had just figured out half of what I was trying to do... except it's printing one ant, not all ants...
2011-10-29T22:09:27  <Islacrusez> so probably still doing it wrong
2011-10-29T22:10:00  <bmh> is everyone else flying solo or did other people team up?

2011-10-29T22:12:13  <Antimony> so it's important to focus on other thigns fist

2011-10-29T22:12:57  <Antimony> that only works if the hills are undefended
2011-10-29T22:13:04  <Antimony> it could be useful on multihill maps though

2011-10-29T23:27:53  <TheShagg> I should note this is a fresh, unmolested install
2011-10-29T23:28:25  <TheShagg> on windows 7, using JDK 7, python2.7
2011-10-29T23:29:42  <mediocrist> it looks like the option for game rounds is receiving two arguments. Mind pasting that part of the code up here?
2011-10-29T23:30:37  <mediocrist> the --turns bit
2011-10-29T23:30:50  <mediocrist> and whatever's after it
2011-10-29T23:31:33  <TheShagg> it should be whatever comes in the tools download for windows
2011-10-29T23:31:45  <TheShagg> if you can give me a more specific thing to paste, I would be happy to

2011-10-29T23:32:14  <mediocrist> if you edit the file, it should look roughly like this "@echo off python "%~dp0playgame.py" --engine_seed 42 --player_seed 42 --end_wait=0.25 --verbose --log_dir game_logs --turns 500 --map_file "%~dp0maps\example\tutorial1.map" %* "python ""%~dp0sample_bots\python\GreedyBot.py""" "java -jar MyBot.jar"  "
2011-10-29T23:32:30  <mediocrist> maybe, without the java bit at the end

2011-10-29T23:34:32  <mediocrist> does the tutorial.cmd work?

2011-10-29T23:45:32  <TheShagg> and typing "python" brings up the interactive prompt

2011-10-29T23:47:02  <thestinger> is it python 3.2 or 2.7?
2011-10-29T23:47:35  <thestinger> you probably can't use an out of date cpython to run the stuff
2011-10-29T23:47:45  <TheShagg> 2.7
2011-10-29T23:47:53  <TheShagg> downloaded and installed 30 minutes ago
2011-10-29T23:50:34  <TheShagg> I dont understand how "        game = Ants(game_options)"  equates to 2 arguments
2011-10-29T23:50:34  <TheShagg> but I am not a python person
2011-10-29T23:51:08  <thestinger> python methods receive the object as the first argument
2011-10-29T23:51:24  <TheShagg> oh ok, it's effectively "self"
2011-10-29T23:51:29  <TheShagg> ?
2011-10-29T23:51:31  <TheShagg> but hidden stealth
2011-10-29T23:51:58  <thestinger> well, you actually have to write 'def __init__(self)', or 'def __init__(self, arg1)' if you want to take 1 argument
2011-10-29T23:52:16  <thestinger> then when you make an instance of the class you do ClassName(arg1)
2011-10-29T23:52:55  <thestinger> so, an argument is being passed to Ants for initialization and it doesn't take any arguments other than self (that's the python reason for the problem, not sure why it's happening though)
2011-10-29T23:52:57  <TheShagg> that is strange, it says:
2011-10-29T23:52:59  <TheShagg>     def __init__(self):
2011-10-29T23:53:05  <TheShagg> in Ants

2011-10-29T23:53:08  <thestinger> yeah, so __init__ doesn't take any arguments
2011-10-29T23:53:19  <TheShagg> .....
2011-10-29T23:53:29  <thestinger> Ants(game_options) is passing a second argument to __init__()
2011-10-29T23:53:38  <TheShagg> ok, I agree with you
2011-10-29T23:53:41  <thestinger> maybe try a different version of the tools?
2011-10-29T23:53:54  <TheShagg> anyone in here a project admin?
2011-10-29T23:54:09  <ghjgghj> what's a good way to solve the timeout issue in the tutorial bot on big maps?
2011-10-29T23:55:08  <thestinger> ghjgghj: stop checking the manhattan distance from each ant to each unseen location
2011-10-29T23:55:35  <ghjgghj> but then how do I expoler?
2011-10-29T23:56:01  <thestinger> use a different way of measuring distances

2011-10-29T23:56:32  <thestinger> I use a BFS search to measure distance
2011-10-29T23:57:07  <ghjgghj> what's BFS?
2011-10-29T23:57:23  <thestinger> for exploration, I make a single 2d array of integers (initialized to -1) and then run a breadth-first search from each unseen location
2011-10-29T23:57:41  <thestinger> so I set the distance value to 0 at the unseen location, and increment by 1 each time it moves a node away
2011-10-29T23:57:50  <thestinger> and I stop as soon as the value would be higher than the current value there
2011-10-29T23:58:30  <thestinger> and for water I leave them at -1 and stop the search
2011-10-29T23:58:44  <ghjgghj> huh? I am new to thing, so i am a little confused
2011-10-29T23:58:46  <thestinger> that gets distance measurements done for every ant and does pathfinding for free too
2011-10-29T23:58:54  <thestinger> here, I'll pastebin an example
2011-10-29T23:59:18  <ghjgghj> ok, thanks a lot
