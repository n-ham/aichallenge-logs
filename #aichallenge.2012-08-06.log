2012-08-06T08:27:45  <bobo> hello?
2012-08-06T08:27:49  <bobo> anyone here?
2012-08-06T08:31:06  <pairofdice> Tip: Don't ask if you can ask a question
2012-08-06T08:33:12  <bobo> ok. first of all, how much experience do I need. I see myself as a beginner and the only thing I learned abotu programming are from two years of programming class in high school.
2012-08-06T08:34:05  <pairofdice> That's more than enough to start
2012-08-06T08:34:26  <aerique> bobo: well, you won't win the challenge but any skill level can compete, have fun and learn something from it
2012-08-06T08:34:35  <pairofdice> Well, considering what a high school programming level implies might be just enough
2012-08-06T08:35:33  <bobo> it's not that I hope to win or climb the rankings, I'm jsut trying to have some fun and get experience, but I worry that I might be totally overwhelmed by the matter and fail totally.
2012-08-06T08:36:00  <pairofdice> Nah, it's pretty good for beginners
2012-08-06T08:36:19  <pairofdice> At least in Python and Java?
2012-08-06T08:36:55  <bobo> thanks. I guess, I'll be okay. my second question is, how can I compete or try my bots. The Sign up is closed and I don't have an account.
2012-08-06T08:37:20  <pairofdice> The competition ended in december last year
2012-08-06T08:37:30  <pairofdice> And the next one has no start date set
2012-08-06T08:37:33  <aerique> bobo: with that attitude (fun & improvement) you'lll be fine
2012-08-06T08:38:23  <bobo> I know that the competition ended, but I want to try the bots by myself and see how they work. There must be some ways like offline matches, right?
2012-08-06T08:38:33  <pairofdice> Sure
2012-08-06T08:38:52  <pairofdice> There are some bots available online
2012-08-06T08:39:14  <pairofdice> And a couple fairly stupid ones in the starter package
2012-08-06T08:40:00  <bobo> great :) Then I'll read some tutorials and get into the matter. If I don't need an account, it'll be alright, I guess.
2012-08-06T08:40:25  <bobo> thanks to you two. you helped me a lot! Have a great day :)
2012-08-06T08:40:42  <pairofdice> You too

2012-08-06T09:23:45  <antimatroid> first year logic, given a matrix A, since AA^T is symmetric we can conclude any matrix multiplied by its transpose is symmetric.

2012-08-06T11:48:09  <antimatroid> the one i linked? no idea
2012-08-06T11:48:23  <antimatroid> i'm looking for the number of elements in my diagram semigroups
2012-08-06T11:48:31  <antimatroid> when i have a fixed number of nodes along the top
2012-08-06T11:48:39  <antimatroid> i know it goes 1,4,18,...

2012-08-06T11:49:09  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure i know what diagrams are or aren't feasible

2012-08-06T11:49:54  <antimatroid> umm, similar
2012-08-06T11:49:59  <mcstar> the numbers are different
2012-08-06T11:50:03  <antimatroid> it's taking those trident generators
2012-08-06T11:50:08  <antimatroid> they generate a semigroup
2012-08-06T11:53:57  <antimatroid> mcstar; http://sketchia.com/draw.html#8SaceTa
2012-08-06T11:54:10  <antimatroid> the top left diagram is a "generator" when there's 5 top nodes
2012-08-06T11:54:40  <antimatroid> basically the generators have the triapse adjacent then lines joining nodes from top to bottom
2012-08-06T11:54:59  <antimatroid> to do the product of two diagrams you put one below the other and forget the middle nodes
2012-08-06T11:55:21  <antimatroid> if there's a path joining a top node to a bottom node then they're part of the same hyperedge
2012-08-06T11:56:25  <antimatroid> i am pretty sure starting from the generators you can get to the diagrams such that if a (hyper)edge connects a nodes along the top then it has to connect something in [a]_3 nodes along the bottom
2012-08-06T11:56:36  <antimatroid> two examples of valid diagrams that can be generated are there
2012-08-06T11:56:42  <antimatroid> then it's a matter of counting those feasible diagrams
2012-08-06T11:56:48  <antimatroid> then i have to work out the structure for all this
