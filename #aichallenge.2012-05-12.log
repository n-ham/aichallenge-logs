2012-05-12T08:21:20  <mleise> hehe. i really forget how old some of the functional languages are
2012-05-12T08:21:56  <mleise> but they all evolve much faster than, e.g. C
2012-05-12T08:22:29  <mcstar> yeah, a lot of people are convinced they can deal with the big and future programs better
2012-05-12T08:22:39  <mcstar> in the meantime everyone does imperative programming
2012-05-12T08:22:51  <mcstar> programs->problems
2012-05-12T08:22:59  <mcstar> like parallelism
2012-05-12T08:23:22  <mleise> there was this version control system written in haskell
2012-05-12T08:23:28  <mleise> dracs? darcs?
2012-05-12T08:23:29  <mcstar> darcs
2012-05-12T08:24:16  <mleise> Some programmers claim that the source code became unmaintainable because of the language used
2012-05-12T08:25:24  <mcstar> i read that theres some performance issues with it, because of the merging model they use
2012-05-12T08:25:49  <mcstar> it is mathematically sound, but can run into combinatorial explosion
2012-05-12T08:26:03  <mleise> I can imagine that neither git or svn are particularly easy to implement
2012-05-12T08:26:17  <mcstar> i guess the initial git was quite easy
2012-05-12T08:26:18  <mleise> fascinating
2012-05-12T08:26:35  <mcstar> or linus is just a genius
2012-05-12T08:27:12  <mleise> i bet he planned that for a year before hand
2012-05-12T08:28:19  <mleise> it has quite a lot of inteeractions when you look closer. like submodules or filtering out files from the history.
2012-05-12T08:28:52  <mleise> if you don't plan for all of them, I think its hard to add them later without running into bugs
2012-05-12T08:29:25  <mcstar> do you exclude rewrites?
2012-05-12T08:29:46  <mcstar> some people are brave enough to rewrite things that dont work
2012-05-12T08:30:41  <mleise> I think git is a rewrite of svn :p
2012-05-12T08:30:50  <mcstar> btw, hacking a kernel for that long time, must advance a man's planning abilities

2012-05-12T08:33:30  <mcstar> i saw a talk with him, i think you did too, and yeah, he said he was fed up with svn and wanted a proper version control for the kernel
2012-05-12T08:33:52  <mcstar> i think it was svn they used previously

2012-05-12T13:17:06  <antimatroid> i can sleep in
2012-05-12T13:17:15  <antimatroid> although i have a hockey game at 2pm
2012-05-12T13:17:26  * mcstar 's lame attempt at a joke
2012-05-12T13:18:01  <mcstar> hockey games are nice, if you miss them, you can make it up at home
2012-05-12T13:18:36  <mcstar> you porbably dont get it
2012-05-12T13:18:59  <mcstar> zsebhockey == pocket hockey == jerking off
2012-05-12T13:21:32  <pairofdice> uh huh

2012-05-12T13:34:51  <antimatroid> i quite often use one or the other
2012-05-12T13:37:37  <mcstar> antimatroid: last time this topic was on you were adamant that 'maths' is the correct (i.e. australian) one
2012-05-12T13:42:40  <antimatroid> it is
2012-05-12T13:42:43  <antimatroid> but i no longer care :P

2012-05-12T13:58:17  <pairofdice> I started to use browser bookmarks in a more organised manner. A bit odd that it took this long considering my poor memory

2012-05-12T14:12:01  <antimatroid> mcstar: try and solve that before reading my answer
2012-05-12T14:12:05  <antimatroid> it took me a bit of thought
2012-05-12T14:13:16  <mcstar> Reny?
2012-05-12T14:13:20  <mcstar> is that Renyi?
2012-05-12T14:14:00  <antimatroid> what?
2012-05-12T14:14:44  <mcstar> The centipede game was first introduced by Rosenthal (1982) and has subsequently been studied by Binmore(1987), Kreps (1990) Reny (1988)
2012-05-12T14:15:05  <mcstar> im just wandering whether he is Reny Akfred or not
2012-05-12T14:15:10  <mcstar> Renyi Alfred
2012-05-12T14:15:16  <mcstar> (i suck)
2012-05-12T14:18:19  <mcstar> antimatroid: thats a weird problem, i dont think im up to it
2012-05-12T14:18:30  <antimatroid> i just added a more interesting case to the bottom of my answer
2012-05-12T14:18:39  <antimatroid> it wasn't too hard in the end, it's just a bit of a mouthful to read
2012-05-12T14:18:59  <mcstar> game theory is weird
2012-05-12T14:19:50  <mcstar> The tricky part for me is: now assume that P1 and P2 are both rational, and that they know that each other are rational, BUT P1 does NOT know that P2 knows that P1 is rational
2012-05-12T14:19:51  <mcstar> wtf?
2012-05-12T14:20:34  <mcstar> if you assume ratinality, this question is moot
2012-05-12T14:20:39  <mcstar> ratinality*
2012-05-12T14:20:44  <mcstar> rationality
2012-05-12T14:21:39  <antimatroid> there's a mistake in my answer
2012-05-12T14:22:02  <mcstar> i dont want to read it
2012-05-12T14:22:10  <mcstar> maybe later ill give it a thought
2012-05-12T14:22:56  <pairofdice> Appearing crazy yet being completely rational
2012-05-12T14:28:20  <antimatroid> mcstar: do you know what common knowledge means?
2012-05-12T14:28:39  <mcstar> i guess
2012-05-12T14:28:58  <antimatroid> something is common knowledge  between the two of us if you and i both know it, we both know that we each know it, we each know that we each know that we each know it, ad infinitum
2012-05-12T14:29:09  <antimatroid> you can both know something without knowing you each know it
2012-05-12T14:29:09  <antimatroid> etc.
2012-05-12T14:29:34  <antimatroid> such information can be important with strategic situations
2012-05-12T14:29:47  <mcstar> weird
2012-05-12T14:30:20  <mcstar> if i know something, why shouldnt i assume that my adversary knows that i know that?
2012-05-12T14:30:23  <antimatroid> think about ants
2012-05-12T14:30:27  <antimatroid> i knew how many ants i had
2012-05-12T14:30:34  <antimatroid> and so did each of my enemies
2012-05-12T14:30:42  <antimatroid> but we all knew that everyone else didn't know how many we had
2012-05-12T14:30:45  <antimatroid> that was important information
2012-05-12T14:31:11  <antimatroid> not quite the same
2012-05-12T14:31:13  <antimatroid> but similar
2012-05-12T14:31:47  <mcstar> my battles were 1on1
2012-05-12T14:31:54  <antimatroid> i think there was an example on reddit yesterday about the carrot myth
2012-05-12T14:32:03  <mcstar> in the end i didnt use game tree at all
2012-05-12T14:32:23  <mcstar> carrot myth?
2012-05-12T14:32:38  <thestinger> I just figured out the next turn so sort of like a 2-ply game tree
2012-05-12T14:32:40  <mcstar> is this a creation myth? the world is inside a giant carrot?
2012-05-12T14:32:44  <antimatroid> where the us army said eating carrots or something would improve eyesight in darkness to hide the fact that the us had advanced radar technology
2012-05-12T14:32:49  <thestinger> and not all possibilities at all
2012-05-12T14:32:58  <antimatroid> they knew something and didn't assume their enemies knew that they knew it
2012-05-12T14:33:35  <antimatroid> or when they cracked the enigma
2012-05-12T14:33:44  <mcstar> antimatroid: but war is not rational at all
2012-05-12T14:33:53  <pairofdice> it is
2012-05-12T14:33:56  <mcstar> no
2012-05-12T14:34:00  <mcstar> why kill people?
2012-05-12T14:34:08  <antimatroid> mcstar: it's a mathematical model
2012-05-12T14:34:17  <mcstar> :(
2012-05-12T14:34:25  <antimatroid> that's what all of science is
2012-05-12T14:34:31  <mcstar> your mathematics is dangerous
2012-05-12T14:34:39  <mcstar> and unholy
2012-05-12T14:34:47  <antimatroid> :P
2012-05-12T14:34:47  <pairofdice> :)
2012-05-12T14:35:24  <mcstar> antimatroid: did you see the movie Enigma?
2012-05-12T14:35:27  <mcstar> i quite like it
2012-05-12T14:35:33  <antimatroid> don't think so
2012-05-12T14:35:34  <mcstar> it features alan turing
2012-05-12T14:35:44  <mcstar> (but he isnt homosexual in the movie)
2012-05-12T14:35:45  <antimatroid> turing was a dude
2012-05-12T14:35:47  <pairofdice> Is it... about enigma?
2012-05-12T14:35:49  <antimatroid> von neumann was more awesome
2012-05-12T14:36:49  <mcstar> tbh his model of computation sucks
2012-05-12T14:37:23  <mcstar> they say he could do his work best, when he was in a busy room
2012-05-12T14:37:40  <mcstar> or when he was listening to german marching music
2012-05-12T14:38:00  <mcstar> and the guy had a great memory too
2012-05-12T14:38:21  <mcstar> antimatroid: theres a story, when he solved the problem of the 2 trains and the fly
2012-05-12T14:38:44  <mcstar> the punchline is, that he summed up an infinite series in his head in a second
2012-05-12T14:39:00  <mcstar> instead of coming up with the shortcut solution to the trick question
2012-05-12T14:40:47  <antimatroid> mcstar: i've heard all the stories :P
2012-05-12T14:40:52  <antimatroid> have you seen his contents on wikipedia?
2012-05-12T14:40:57  <antimatroid> that alone is ridiculous
2012-05-12T14:41:04  <antimatroid> he made significant contributions across the board
2012-05-12T14:41:15  <antimatroid> from maths, physics, biology, economics, etc. etc.
2012-05-12T14:41:43  <antimatroid> err, not sure about the biology
2012-05-12T14:41:47  <mcstar> yeah he was a genious
2012-05-12T14:41:55  <delt0r> he made a little contribution...
2012-05-12T14:41:58  <mcstar> he had children didnt he?
2012-05-12T14:42:08  <antimatroid> daughter is still alive i think
2012-05-12T14:42:12  <delt0r> that is not what i meant :P
2012-05-12T14:42:56  <antimatroid> anyway i need some sleep
2012-05-12T14:43:02  <antimatroid> my answer to that question was very flawed
2012-05-12T14:43:02  <mcstar> let me guess, he predicted the DNS?
2012-05-12T14:43:06  <antimatroid> i'm not really sure anymore
2012-05-12T14:43:34  <antimatroid> he laid the mathematical foundations for quantum mechanics
2012-05-12T14:43:44  <mcstar> delt0r: would you tell what was his contribution to biology?
2012-05-12T14:43:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: well, not entirely
2012-05-12T14:44:08  <mcstar> heisenberg did some work too
2012-05-12T14:44:33  <delt0r> in fact much of the quantum math stuff was done more or less as it was needed later on
2012-05-12T14:44:56  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics
2012-05-12T14:45:01  <delt0r> in bio he showed that a self replicating machine needs both the machine.... AND the data
2012-05-12T14:45:10  <antimatroid> that makes it sound like his work was more useful than it was maybe?
2012-05-12T14:45:32  <delt0r> antimatroid: yea i know... but his contribution is over hyped in hind site since most think he is awesome...
2012-05-12T14:45:45  <mcstar> antimatroid: the stress is on rigorous i think
2012-05-12T14:45:50  <mcstar> the machinery was there already
2012-05-12T14:45:57  <antimatroid> i'm a man of rigour
2012-05-12T14:46:03  <mcstar> but he was a mathematician at once too
2012-05-12T14:46:03  <delt0r> but its still called dirac whatever or other guys name whatever
2012-05-12T14:46:08  <delt0r> not von neuman
2012-05-12T14:46:20  <antimatroid> hehe, funny question on reddit the other day
2012-05-12T14:46:34  <antimatroid> when are they going to stop calling it the poincare conjecture now that it's been proved?
2012-05-12T14:46:58  <delt0r> when? did i miss it?
2012-05-12T14:47:06  <mcstar> perelman?
2012-05-12T14:47:26  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-05-12T14:47:27  <antimatroid> ages ago
2012-05-12T14:47:40  <mcstar> dude looks like a serial killer
2012-05-12T14:48:08  <mcstar> he has quite a fame for not taking the money
2012-05-12T14:48:16  <mcstar> pople try to make him speak all the time
2012-05-12T14:48:25  <mcstar> but he doesnt really epxlain anything
2012-05-12T14:48:34  <mcstar> except once he told his reasons to another mathematician
2012-05-12T14:48:41  <mcstar> some american dude

2012-05-12T15:03:38  <mleise> oh wait ... you cannot bitwise negate a bigint, right?
2012-05-12T15:04:00  <mcstar> you can
2012-05-12T15:04:30  <mcstar> i think gmp overloads all the standard int operators
2012-05-12T15:05:10  <thestinger> gmpxx.h does
2012-05-12T15:06:09  <thestinger> but it's very incomplete
2012-05-12T15:06:26  <thestinger> you have to use gmp.h anyway and it's often easier to just use mpz_t instead of mpz_class
2012-05-12T15:06:50  <thestinger> a + b returns a weird intermediate value and it doesn't play nice with templated stuff
2012-05-12T15:08:35  <mcstar> he probably isnt using gmp
2012-05-12T15:09:03  <thestinger> I should do the week6 crypto stuff soon
2012-05-12T15:09:10  <mcstar> and in languages whose bigint implementation is based on gmp, the support probably is complete
2012-05-12T15:09:16  <mcstar> meh too
2012-05-12T15:09:23  <mcstar> i dont feel like it though
2012-05-12T15:09:29  <thestinger> I'll just do it monday because of the udacity work I have to do first
2012-05-12T15:09:40  <thestinger> mcstar: I optimized the hell out of the week5 thing :P
2012-05-12T15:09:58  <thestinger> in python it was a few lines
2012-05-12T15:10:12  <mcstar> and it was fast too
2012-05-12T15:10:16  <mcstar> so why optimize?
2012-05-12T15:10:22  <thestinger> how fast was yours?
2012-05-12T15:10:22  <mcstar> anyway, your time
2012-05-12T15:10:25  <thestinger> mine wasn't fast
2012-05-12T15:10:27  <mcstar> couple of secs
2012-05-12T15:10:39  <mcstar> thestinger: coursera?

2012-05-12T15:10:53  <thestinger> https://gist.github.com/50bde2c568cbb29939fb the low-level version :P
2012-05-12T15:11:06  <thestinger> set/unordered_set ended up being the bottleneck at the end
2012-05-12T15:11:55  <thestinger> the C API for gmp is so low-level compared to the C++ one
2012-05-12T15:11:59  <thestinger> but it's way faster :\
2012-05-12T15:13:00  <mcstar> thestinger: http://sprunge.us/VUVI
2012-05-12T15:13:13  <thestinger> yes, in python it's 8 lines
2012-05-12T15:13:26  <thestinger> mcstar: don't use has_key :(
2012-05-12T15:13:34  <thestinger> deprecated (gone in v3) and slower than in
2012-05-12T15:14:10  <mcstar> thestinger: why is it slower?
2012-05-12T15:14:24  <mcstar> why doesnt has_key use 'in' behind the scenes?
2012-05-12T15:14:30  <thestinger> it does
2012-05-12T15:14:36  <thestinger> but method calls are slow
2012-05-12T15:14:48  <thestinger> .has_key(key) is 2 dict lookups
2012-05-12T15:14:48  <mcstar> what is 'in"
2012-05-12T15:14:54  <thestinger> 1 for has_key and 1 for looking up the key
2012-05-12T15:15:00  <thestinger> in doesn't do a method lookup
2012-05-12T15:15:06  <thestinger> in pypy it doesn't matter
2012-05-12T15:15:12  <thestinger> in theory :P
2012-05-12T15:15:14  <mcstar> i dont understand why does it matter
2012-05-12T15:15:38  <mcstar> 'in' doesnt return the value?
2012-05-12T15:15:54  <thestinger> a in {} vs {}.has_key(a)
2012-05-12T15:15:58  <thestinger> both return a bool
2012-05-12T15:16:30  <mcstar> yeah right
2012-05-12T15:16:40  <mcstar> so why would the 2nd inefficent?
2012-05-12T15:16:46  <mcstar> be*

2012-05-12T15:18:00  <thestinger> the global scope is a dict, the local scope can be optimized to a stack
2012-05-12T15:18:38  <pairofdice> Yeah, making locals out of globals speeds things up a bit
2012-05-12T15:18:48  <thestinger> mcstar: well, if you avoid stuff like that and cache method lookups, you can get cpython to beat pypy
2012-05-12T15:19:04  <thestinger> pypy is slower at stuff like pow()
2012-05-12T15:19:07  <mcstar> i heard that before pairofdice
2012-05-12T15:19:09  <thestinger> it just has much less overhead everywhere else
2012-05-12T15:19:13  <mcstar> just didnt understand why
2012-05-12T15:19:32  <mcstar> thestinger: runs 10 secs faster with 'in'
2012-05-12T15:19:37  <mcstar> 46 secs
2012-05-12T15:20:44  <pairofdice> and all builtins are globals
2012-05-12T15:21:06  <thestinger> pypy changes the rules though
2012-05-12T15:21:18  <thestinger> for example a list comprehension vs a for loop doesn't matter
2012-05-12T15:21:41  <thestinger> itertools and the operator module will often still be slower than just doing it manually atm too (unlike cpython)
2012-05-12T15:22:17  <thestinger> list comprehensions are only faster in cpython because they have their own bytecode value for appending to a list
2012-05-12T15:22:23  <thestinger> no method lookup
2012-05-12T15:22:57  <thestinger> weird stuff :P
2012-05-12T15:23:31  <thestinger> mcstar: the dis module is the scientific way of figuring it out
2012-05-12T15:24:08  <mcstar> go ahead
2012-05-12T15:24:58  <thestinger> mcstar: http://sprunge.us/hBCQ
2012-05-12T15:25:23  <thestinger> you can see b() does a lookup (LOAD_ATTR) and a function call
2012-05-12T15:25:54  <mcstar> thats useless
2012-05-12T15:26:06  <mcstar> you dont know the cost of those bytecodes
2012-05-12T15:26:21  <mcstar> tri common lisp, you get machine disassembly
2012-05-12T15:26:24  <mcstar> try*
2012-05-12T15:27:04  <mcstar> and the optimizing vm van change quite a bit i guess
2012-05-12T15:27:19  <thestinger> cpython doesn't really optimize the bytecode
2012-05-12T15:27:27  <mcstar> but pypy should
2012-05-12T15:27:36  <thestinger> yes, in theory
2012-05-12T15:27:38  <thestinger> and it often does
2012-05-12T15:27:57  <mcstar> thestinger: anyway, thanks for the tip, but i really dont care about this
2012-05-12T15:28:07  <thestinger> I know :P
2012-05-12T15:28:11  <mcstar> :)
2012-05-12T15:28:29  <thestinger> pypy has a tracing thing now so you can see what it actually executed

2012-05-12T15:31:48  <mcstar> thestinger: you seem to be really interested in this stuff, why dont you just write your own language and compiler/itnerpreter?
2012-05-12T15:32:35  <thestinger> too much to do :P
2012-05-12T15:33:12  <thestinger> mcstar: one of the udacity courses is actually covering that so it's a good intro (lexer/parser/compiler for javascript)
2012-05-12T15:33:42  <thestinger> well, a subset of javascript

2012-05-12T16:21:13  <mcstar> thestinger: i did a prefix trie in c++
2012-05-12T16:21:20  <mcstar> copied my haskell code
2012-05-12T16:21:42  <mcstar> 25 lines, shorter than the haskell one
2012-05-12T16:23:15  <mcstar> im glad that lookup is slower than for the other one
2012-05-12T16:24:44  <mcstar> hah great
2012-05-12T16:24:53  <mcstar> with references its the same speed
2012-05-12T16:25:19  <mcstar> filling it up takes 3 secs, while the haskell one takes 16 secs
2012-05-12T16:36:28  <mcstar> i think im gonna install windows
2012-05-12T16:36:47  <pairofdice> o_o
2012-05-12T16:37:16  <mcstar> i have a 20GB laptop drive somewhere here
2012-05-12T16:37:41  <pairofdice> Antiques
2012-05-12T16:37:42  <mcstar> that way i wont hurt my precious Arch on my junk laptop
2012-05-12T16:38:11  <mcstar> pairofdice: i want to try f# in visual studio, without using a virtual machine
2012-05-12T16:38:38  <pairofdice> You want to isntall an OS for that?
2012-05-12T16:38:39  <mcstar> i have win7 in a vdi image, but i run it in qemu
2012-05-12T16:38:47  <mcstar> yeah
2012-05-12T16:39:15  <mcstar> it is quite nostalgic, its been a great while since i installed windows xp, and that wa for my mom's laptop
2012-05-12T16:39:43  <pairofdice> visual studio takes the better part of a week to install
2012-05-12T16:39:51  <mcstar> lol
2012-05-12T16:39:55  <mcstar> not really
2012-05-12T16:40:00  <mcstar> couple of minutes
2012-05-12T16:40:07  <mcstar> i have the whole dev environment in win7
2012-05-12T16:41:57  <mcstar> pairofdice: the real pita will be downloading the dell drivers for the lappy, but thats part of the nostalgia, right? XD

2012-05-12T17:55:54  <thestinger> I think there's some other stuff that has to happen first
2012-05-12T17:56:02  <srgpqt> such as..?
2012-05-12T17:56:49  <mcstar> you know, stuff...
2012-05-12T17:57:01  <pairofdice> framework stuff
2012-05-12T17:57:12  <mcstar> not just that, other stuff too
2012-05-12T17:57:18  <mcstar> important stuff
2012-05-12T17:57:25  <thestinger> srgpqt: amstan said they were going to register it as a non-profit first
2012-05-12T17:57:37  <thestinger> so donations are easier to do
2012-05-12T17:58:27  <srgpqt> k
2012-05-12T18:00:30  <mcstar> srgpqt: in the meantime take some coursera/udacity class, to fill the gap

2012-05-12T18:07:55  <srgpqt> any course suggestions in particular?
2012-05-12T18:13:56  <mcstar> you could certainly benefit from a machine learning class, if you have no background in that
2012-05-12T18:14:39  <mcstar> and another one which is praised, and important but i dont have experience with is probabilistic graphical models
2012-05-12T18:14:59  <mcstar> you have to check though, when will these start
