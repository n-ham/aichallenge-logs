2011-04-11T00:32:28  <antimatroid> Frontier: my current bot is player 1, the other 3 are hunter bot
2011-04-11T00:34:01  <antimatroid> might be time to see how stocha's bot does against it
2011-04-11T00:39:00  <antimatroid> has anyone here run Stocha's bot?
2011-04-11T00:39:08  <antimatroid> i can't get it to use the .jar file

2011-04-11T00:46:12  <antimatroid> Stocha: your bot times out
2011-04-11T00:47:35  <Stocha> does it ?
2011-04-11T00:47:40  <Stocha> what kind of setting do you use ?
2011-04-11T00:47:52  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/d0TNV9FN
2011-04-11T00:47:55  <antimatroid> you are yellow
2011-04-11T00:48:15  <antimatroid> i am red, the other two are hunter bot
2011-04-11T00:48:28  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2011-04-11T00:48:30  <Stocha> my bot take like 100 ms in all test i made
2011-04-11T00:48:46  <Stocha> i have a faster simpler version now anyway
2011-04-11T00:49:09  <Stocha> that can work with 10000 ants on a 1024x1024 map most probably
2011-04-11T00:49:29  <Stocha> my viewer and my patient can't follow anyway
2011-04-11T00:50:12  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-04-11T00:50:16  <antimatroid> not sure why it's timing out then
2011-04-11T00:50:22  <antimatroid> what size maps are you testing on?
2011-04-11T00:51:33  <antimatroid> this is 108 by 84
2011-04-11T00:51:47  <Stocha> i have seen people using it on big maps
2011-04-11T00:51:57  <Stocha> like 170x170 shoudn't be a problem
2011-04-11T00:52:08  <Stocha> i have no idea how you can make time out
2011-04-11T00:52:17  <Stocha> maybe there is a bug that i don't know off.
2011-04-11T00:52:22  <Stocha> or maybe it had no cpu ?
2011-04-11T00:52:40  <Stocha> but no one reported me any time out problem so far.
2011-04-11T00:52:55  <Stocha> try to play it against hunters bot with same setting
2011-04-11T00:53:03  <Stocha> it should go like instantaneously
2011-04-11T00:53:39  <antimatroid> same problem, weird
2011-04-11T00:53:52  <Stocha> the bot is part of an old framework, let me look at a 256x256 game
2011-04-11T00:56:32  <Stocha> i really have no clue of what's going on :p
2011-04-11T00:56:38  <Stocha> how can i reproduce your test ?
2011-04-11T00:56:41  <Stocha> with hunter bots ?
2011-04-11T00:58:53  <Stocha> i just tryed 256x256 with my framework, shouldn't be a problem really
2011-04-11T00:59:08  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/nTBiaCBw
2011-04-11T00:59:12  <antimatroid> that's my shell script
2011-04-11T00:59:56  <Stocha> what sort of jvm do you use ?
2011-04-11T01:00:05  <antimatroid> no idea
2011-04-11T01:00:06  <Stocha> try to put it in first position maybe
2011-04-11T01:00:11  <antimatroid> i just installed what the command line told me to
2011-04-11T01:00:17  <Stocha> because most people would have tryed first an second position
2011-04-11T01:00:26  <Stocha> you have debian ?
2011-04-11T01:00:48  <antimatroid> same problem
2011-04-11T01:00:49  <antimatroid> ubuntu
2011-04-11T01:00:56  <Stocha> what processor ?
2011-04-11T01:01:05  <antimatroid> not really sure, it's not terrible
2011-04-11T01:01:23  <Stocha> maybe it is 10 times slower, and your jvm is really slow :p
2011-04-11T01:01:28  <Stocha> then you can have that timeout.
2011-04-11T01:01:38  <Stocha> although it seems weird still
2011-04-11T01:01:51  <Stocha> can u view my applets ?
2011-04-11T01:01:57  <Stocha> the old ones
2011-04-11T01:02:00  <Stocha> let me find a link
2011-04-11T01:02:25  <sigh> also note that 64bit jvm is slower than 32bit
2011-04-11T01:02:34  <sigh> (but not 10x slower)
2011-04-11T01:02:37  <antimatroid> i'm on 32bit
2011-04-11T01:02:45  <Stocha> ah
2011-04-11T01:02:49  <Stocha> then maybe that's the problem
2011-04-11T01:02:56  <Stocha> i think most people used 64 bits version
2011-04-11T01:03:08  <Stocha> i use long shift heavilly
2011-04-11T01:03:17  <Stocha> maybe it's just really slow on your 32 bits machine.
2011-04-11T01:03:26  <Stocha> i can't test that.
2011-04-11T01:03:36  <Stocha> interesting
2011-04-11T01:04:05  <Stocha> have you tryed the three applet i gave yesterday in here ?
2011-04-11T01:04:30  <antimatroid> no
2011-04-11T01:05:42  <Stocha> trye the 80x80 and open a console
2011-04-11T01:05:45  <Stocha> and tell me the timings
2011-04-11T01:05:58  <Stocha> http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Unreason_80x80_AntDieOnSameSquare/
2011-04-11T01:06:27  <Stocha> i have got 10ms / turn on my machine
2011-04-11T01:06:41  <Stocha> then you can try the bigger one and see how it goes
2011-04-11T01:07:02  <Stocha> if 32 bits can't run my code that's good to know
2011-04-11T01:07:37  <Stocha> i'll put a warning on the forum or something
2011-04-11T01:08:50  <Stocha> http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Unreason_256x256_AntDieOnSameSquare/
2011-04-11T01:09:28  <Stocha> this 256x256 version goes about 70 ms a turn
2011-04-11T01:10:24  <Stocha> hello ?
2011-04-11T01:11:18  <antimatroid> i don't have the plugin
2011-04-11T01:11:30  <antimatroid> sigh: have you watched a game of my bot collecting food yet?
2011-04-11T01:11:33  <Stocha> i can send you an executable
2011-04-11T01:11:34  <antimatroid> it's cool to watch
2011-04-11T01:11:39  <Stocha> i you give my your email
2011-04-11T01:11:45  <antimatroid> nick.hammm@gmail.com
2011-04-11T01:11:45  <sigh> antimatroid: I have not
2011-04-11T01:11:51  <Stocha> then you can give me the timings
2011-04-11T01:11:52  <sigh> hammm
2011-04-11T01:11:59  <antimatroid> ham was taken
2011-04-11T01:12:04  <sigh> haha
2011-04-11T01:12:07  <Stocha> it's really important that i now if 32 bits can't run
2011-04-11T01:12:29  <Stocha> i'll have to be sure the server version is 64 bits also
2011-04-11T01:12:37  <Stocha> official jvm
2011-04-11T01:12:47  <antimatroid> sigh: http://pastebin.com/7dQkKKqn watch that later
2011-04-11T01:13:10  <antimatroid> it can take out 3 hunter bots in 100-150 turns
2011-04-11T01:13:17  <antimatroid> and it's not doing anything strategic for battles
2011-04-11T01:13:30  <sigh> cool
2011-04-11T01:13:50  <Stocha> can you run the command java -version antimatroid ?
2011-04-11T01:14:01  <Stocha> and tell me the output
2011-04-11T01:14:29  <antimatroid> java version "1.5.0"
2011-04-11T01:14:29  <antimatroid> gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.4.5
2011-04-11T01:16:38  <Stocha> i need to get my and onto a 32 bit system
2011-04-11T01:17:47  <antimatroid> you could just not use java :P
2011-04-11T01:17:57  <Stocha> yeah but i can't give a reference bot in c
2011-04-11T01:18:08  <Stocha> because the exec won't run everywhere
2011-04-11T01:18:33  <Stocha> I guess you could still test on lower maps, and see what happens there.
2011-04-11T01:18:47  <Stocha> but really the bot was more meant to be fast than to be strong
2011-04-11T01:19:46  <Stocha> just run a tcp server i'll put my bot in :p
2011-04-11T01:19:59  <Stocha> i can even build a c version then.
2011-04-11T01:22:28  <Stocha> has anyone a 32 bits jvm in here ?
2011-04-11T01:26:37  <Stocha> ah i found an old windows under a shelve with all viruses my wife could download. it's 5 time slower. But i don't see any time out
2011-04-11T01:31:11  <antimatroid> hmmm strange
2011-04-11T01:34:06  <Stocha> your script doesn't seem to run in my environnement
2011-04-11T01:34:13  <Stocha> i don't want to dig too much in it :p

2011-04-11T01:35:56  <antimatroid> meh it's java :P
2011-04-11T01:36:16  <antimatroid> they can play later when there's a tcp
2011-04-11T01:36:40  <Stocha> yeah. But it doesn't seems there will be a tcp soon. Unless someone develop it or something

2011-04-11T01:45:22  <Stocha> so i guess the greed fooding in the particular setting is equivalent to what you do in term of food collecting speed
2011-04-11T01:45:31  <Stocha> (turn 31)
2011-04-11T01:46:18  <Stocha> your bot would most probably have lost.

2011-04-11T07:06:50  <antimatroid> a non-participating bot is still getting points and their ants can't die
2011-04-11T07:07:31  <antimatroid> see this ridiculous game for an example http://pastebin.com/QsfjFyx8
2011-04-11T07:07:35  <sigh> :)
2011-04-11T07:07:56  <sigh> it's not a bug, it's a feature!
2011-04-11T07:08:01  <sigh> :P
2011-04-11T07:11:24  <antimatroid> i was referring to the amount of food with the ridiculous part
2011-04-11T07:11:33  <antimatroid> i went and found where i can play around with that :P
2011-04-11T07:12:20  <Frontier> lol, cool replay :p
2011-04-11T07:12:41  <antimatroid> Frontier: did you look at the one i sent you earlier?
2011-04-11T07:12:48  <antimatroid> i'm very fond of my food collection
2011-04-11T07:13:26  <Frontier> all i really see is a lot of tiny colored dots everywhere
2011-04-11T07:14:14  <antimatroid> consider this situation:
2011-04-11T07:14:14  <antimatroid> *...a..*
2011-04-11T07:14:15  <antimatroid> ....a..*
2011-04-11T07:14:31  <antimatroid> my algorithm will be smart enough to send one of the a's right
2011-04-11T07:14:49  <antimatroid> left***
2011-04-11T07:15:52  <antimatroid> sigh: i think green is dying
2011-04-11T07:16:00  <antimatroid> it's just the score that needs pausing
2011-04-11T07:16:17  <sigh> I'll have a look later
2011-04-11T07:17:22  <Frontier> My bot will be like green and build a frontier
2011-04-11T07:18:03  <sigh> Red is a faster colour

2011-04-11T07:29:16  <sigh> symmetry is for n players
2011-04-11T07:29:52  <antimatroid> it's not working right
2011-04-11T07:32:10  <antimatroid> Frontier: something weird is going on there
2011-04-11T07:32:18  <antimatroid> the food appears after the ants make a different decision?
2011-04-11T07:32:19  <Frontier> Oo
2011-04-11T07:32:58  <sigh> what does that mean?
2011-04-11T07:33:26  <antimatroid> that might be from another food square being in view, hang on
2011-04-11T07:33:53  <Frontier> sigh and me need to know if there is a bug with our code
2011-04-11T07:34:31  <antimatroid> yeah i am looking at my debug file now
2011-04-11T07:34:37  <sigh> btw, I got sick of all this pastebin stuff so: visualize_pastebin() { sed 's|m/|m/download.php?i=|' <<<"$1" | xargs curl | ./visualizer/visualize_locally.py; }
2011-04-11T07:35:06  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure the food square below is causing the first change in moves
2011-04-11T07:35:14  <antimatroid> so the visualiser is fine, but symmetric food spawning doesn't work
2011-04-11T07:35:34  <sigh> I don't understand what you are saying
2011-04-11T07:35:47  <antimatroid> look at the above game
2011-04-11T07:35:51  <sigh> did
2011-04-11T07:35:56  <antimatroid> the food is only symmetric for 2 players
2011-04-11T07:35:57  <antimatroid> not 4
2011-04-11T07:36:36  <antimatroid> use the arrow keys repeatedly to see where stuff is appearing
2011-04-11T07:37:30  <sigh> I see four food appearing each turn
2011-04-11T07:38:01  <antimatroid> yeah 4 are appearing, and sometimes it is symmetric too
2011-04-11T07:38:11  <sigh> hmmm
2011-04-11T07:38:11  <antimatroid> i'm wondering if my method is broken now, eep :P
2011-04-11T07:38:39  <antimatroid> have you found one where it isn't symmetric?
2011-04-11T07:38:47  <sigh> food might be broken, yeah
2011-04-11T07:39:28  <antimatroid> i think my method is wrong :|
2011-04-11T07:39:32  <antimatroid> but i don't know why
2011-04-11T07:41:36  <Frontier> sigh: I currently use copy_paste.html. I have it open in one tab and click copy to clipboard on the pastebin link. it is also quite fast
2011-04-11T07:42:04  <antimatroid> yeah, i just paste it straight into the copy_paste.html thing and tell it to play
2011-04-11T07:42:22  <sigh> Frontier: yeah, but that requires opening the pastebin link
2011-04-11T07:42:57  <antimatroid> are row and col translate around the wrong way?
2011-04-11T07:43:23  <antimatroid> i think that might be it
2011-04-11T07:43:33  <antimatroid> and why it might have worked on a square map
2011-04-11T07:44:30  <sigh> dunno
2011-04-11T07:44:46  <sigh> get_symmetric_food_sets figures out that stuff
2011-04-11T07:44:49  <sigh> have a look there
2011-04-11T07:45:54  <antimatroid> yeah i am atm
2011-04-11T07:45:58  <antimatroid> but it seems right :\

2011-04-11T07:47:32  <sigh> find a broken instance and print out what it's doing that turn
2011-04-11T07:47:49  <sigh> shouldn't be hard to isolate the problem if you can reproduce it
2011-04-11T07:47:56  <sigh> are you running deterministic games?
2011-04-11T07:48:10  <antimatroid> they should be
2011-04-11T07:48:17  <antimatroid> but doesn't matter, i can see it not spawning symmetrically
2011-04-11T07:48:40  <antimatroid> and i'm pretty sure it's doing it flipped somehow
2011-04-11T07:49:15  <antimatroid> maybe doing - one of the translates
2011-04-11T07:49:20  <antimatroid> ah, hang on
2011-04-11T07:49:44  <antimatroid> nah it's absoluting :s
2011-04-11T07:49:45  <antimatroid> weird
2011-04-11T07:51:32  <sigh> just find a specific broken instance and see what the code does to generate it

2011-04-11T22:49:40  <antimatroid> turns out games with the same bot aren't likely to always draw with symmetry maps and spawning
2011-04-11T22:50:28  <phire> doesn't surprise me
2011-04-11T22:50:47  <antimatroid> it would if we made everyones starting relative information the same
2011-04-11T22:51:18  <antimatroid> otherwise due to the wrapping, people will consider things in a different order
2011-04-11T22:54:34  <phire> some bots will be effected by orentation
2011-04-11T22:56:32  <phire> I guess you could transform and flip everybody's starting location
2011-04-11T22:56:46  <phire> then they would see everything identically
2011-04-11T23:03:20  <antimatroid> atm symmetry maps you would just need to translate information for each player
