2011-07-18T00:00:06  <Qua> gives this output 'status eliminated survived'
2011-07-18T00:00:44  <amstan> Qua: "18 2011-07-18 07:42:07 Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases - C# turn    0 bot 0 timed out ", the part where it says "failed test cases" executes "./test_bot.sh Yourbot.exe"
2011-07-18T00:01:00  <amstan> you can reproduce that exact test buy running it locally

2011-07-18T00:01:09  <amstan> if it fails locally it will probably fail when you upload it
2011-07-18T00:02:04  <Qua> that exact command gives: status eliminated survived
2011-07-18T00:02:31  <amstan> should be status survived survived
2011-07-18T00:02:37  <amstan> i think
2011-07-18T00:02:41  <amstan> let me see with a c++ bot
2011-07-18T00:04:29  <amstan> wait.. no
2011-07-18T00:04:31  <amstan> wtf?
2011-07-18T00:04:32  <amstan> same output
2011-07-18T00:06:07  <Qua> Yeah
2011-07-18T00:06:15  <Qua> eliminated survived
2011-07-18T00:06:15  <amstan> Qua: do you have a visualizer?
2011-07-18T00:06:19  <amstan> Qua: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/cpp-starter.replay
2011-07-18T00:06:19  <Qua> watched the replay
2011-07-18T00:06:26  <Qua> the test bot owns
2011-07-18T00:06:27  <Qua> :D
2011-07-18T00:06:31  <amstan> Qua: it does eh?
2011-07-18T00:06:51  <amstan> Qua: so then it must mean that not only the c# package is getting owned
2011-07-18T00:06:53  <amstan> but the others too
2011-07-18T00:07:25  <Qua> It's kinda strange having to beat a test bot before your upload is validated
2011-07-18T00:07:33  <amstan> Qua: it's not
2011-07-18T00:07:37  <Qua> shouldn't it be (status != 'crashed')
2011-07-18T00:07:38  <Qua> ?
2011-07-18T00:07:41  <amstan> Qua: they could crash their first turn
2011-07-18T00:07:53  <amstan> it's not cool to be let in the tournament like that
2011-07-18T00:07:57  <amstan> they'll just crash every game
2011-07-18T00:08:00  <Qua> true
2011-07-18T00:08:06  <amstan> same with timeouts
2011-07-18T00:08:22  <Qua> still, a bot that doesn't crash will still not validate
2011-07-18T00:08:31  <Qua> because the test bot owns it
2011-07-18T00:08:37  <amstan> Qua: a bot that can't own a simple test shouldn't really be let in
2011-07-18T00:08:46  <amstan> but i think the problem now is that the test is too smart
2011-07-18T00:08:52  <amstan> or something like that
2011-07-18T00:08:57  <Qua> no, but the introduction section on your web site says to upload starter package
2011-07-18T00:08:58  <amstan> freaking rankings not loading
2011-07-18T00:09:01  <Qua> which you cant
2011-07-18T00:09:06  <amstan> Qua: yes, and that's supposed to work
2011-07-18T00:09:10  <Qua> idd
2011-07-18T00:09:21  <amstan> Qua: can you find me links to other starter bots?
2011-07-18T00:09:26  <amstan> the page really doesn't want to load for me

2011-07-18T00:09:51  <amstan> Qua: not the zips
2011-07-18T00:09:54  <amstan> the bots in the game
2011-07-18T00:10:01  <Qua> 2 secfs
2011-07-18T00:10:28  <Qua> but still
2011-07-18T00:10:39  <Qua> are bots that are already uploaded still being tested ?
2011-07-18T00:10:57  <amstan> yes
2011-07-18T00:10:59  <Qua> it seemes strange that all c# bots timeouts at turn 0. However, this could be a totally different problem
2011-07-18T00:11:00  <amstan> against new bots

2011-07-18T00:12:21  <amstan> what's the status of the latest few games?
2011-07-18T00:12:34  <Qua> haven't loaded it yet
2011-07-18T00:12:36  <amstan> ok
2011-07-18T00:13:10  <Qua> iit plays
2011-07-18T00:13:10  <janzert> the submission test hasn't been changed since the beginning of april
2011-07-18T00:13:11  <Qua> and wins
2011-07-18T00:13:12  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/submission_test
2011-07-18T00:13:55  <Qua> it has won all matched played today

2011-07-18T00:14:48  <amstan> janzert: why do both cpp and c# get eliminated?
2011-07-18T00:16:51  <Qua> It would make sense if the testbot and MyBot changed positions

2011-07-18T00:17:16  <janzert> looks to me like the players are wrong
2011-07-18T00:17:29  <janzert> the testbot should be the second player there
2011-07-18T00:18:29  <Qua> exactly
2011-07-18T00:19:09  <janzert> was there an engine commit that is changing the order of players or something?
2011-07-18T00:21:12  <janzert> test_bot.sh and test_bot.cmd both list the test_bot as the second player btw
2011-07-18T00:21:58  <Qua> yup
2011-07-18T00:22:22  <amstan> janzert: you sure it's not the test bot owning ppl?
2011-07-18T00:22:30  <amstan> we did change the battle stuff recently
2011-07-18T00:22:48  <amstan> or are those settings hardcoded in the test_bot?
2011-07-18T00:23:00  <janzert> what settings?
2011-07-18T00:25:06  <amstan> see notice on http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/
2011-07-18T00:25:11  <janzert> hmm, actually relooking at the test map it is the bot being tested that is put in the enclosed positions
2011-07-18T00:26:00  <janzert> but what does that have to do with the testbot?
2011-07-18T00:26:23  <amstan> idk, did the game settings change in the test game too?
2011-07-18T00:26:24  <Qua> starter packages are being eliminated by the test bot, and thus fail the upload test
2011-07-18T00:26:26  <amstan> or are they still the same?
2011-07-18T00:26:55  <janzert> they would have changed
2011-07-18T00:27:35  <amstan> janzert: yes, so that's maybe why they fail now
2011-07-18T00:27:41  <amstan> test became too hard
2011-07-18T00:28:07  <janzert> it doesn't have to win the test game, just not crash or timeout
2011-07-18T00:28:35  <Qua> That makes sense.
2011-07-18T00:28:41  <Qua> And they don't crash or timeout
2011-07-18T00:28:53  <Qua> locally anyway, but they still fail upload test
2011-07-18T00:28:53  <janzert> see around line 451 of worker.py
2011-07-18T00:29:13  <janzert> that's the way I'm reading it at least
2011-07-18T00:30:05  <janzert> the result for the bot being tested just can't be one of ('crashed', 'timeout', 'invalid')
2011-07-18T00:30:59  <Qua> so, it works locally, and it works when amstan tests it on the server
2011-07-18T00:31:07  <Qua> doesn't work when we upload it to the server though
2011-07-18T00:31:16  <amstan> then the tournament manager/sandbox doesn't like it
2011-07-18T00:31:44  <janzert> amstan: you're testing it on a worker?
2011-07-18T00:31:54  <amstan> janzert: no, just main server
2011-07-18T00:31:59  <janzert> no guarantee the main server has the same version of stuff at this point
2011-07-18T00:32:34  <janzert> the main server install was a long time ago
2011-07-18T00:47:03  <Qua> Any chance you could test it on one of the worker servers?

2011-07-18T02:58:02  <Qua> If you start next to a food, which you do in the test case being run when uploading your code, then moving onto it will cause you to do an invalid move
2011-07-18T03:00:20  <rabidus> ah, ok. very rare case tho.

2011-07-18T09:44:52  <asdas> hi
2011-07-18T09:45:03  <asdas> I can't find this "g++ timeout issue" on github.
2011-07-18T09:45:19  <asdas> Can anyone help me? I'm not sure if is should open new issue
2011-07-18T09:46:05  <mleise> asdas: yeah and open one for me, too for top and bash and every other command ;)
2011-07-18T09:46:33  <asdas> lol ?
2011-07-18T09:46:54  <mleise> Maybe only g++ 'talks' about its timeout while the other languages just compile for 3 hours until its done :p
2011-07-18T09:47:05  <mleise> the server is really slow in general recently
2011-07-18T09:48:17  <asdas> ok so maybe someone should turn off this g++ timeout. Becouse now nobody can compile their C++ bot.
2011-07-18T09:49:43  <mleise> ok, that would be a good topic for an issue I think :)
2011-07-18T09:52:28  <mleise> i mean... IF this can be disabled in gcc
2011-07-18T10:00:20  <asdas> if not, there should be less game threads... (maybe one free processor core for compillers?)
2011-07-18T10:01:48  <mleise> asdas: I guess the work on the SQL script for the leader board is ongoing. And after that the issue may go away. amstan, janzert?
2011-07-18T10:02:18  <amstan> hmm
2011-07-18T10:02:22  <amstan> how about i change the timeout?
2011-07-18T10:02:34  <amstan> from 120 seconds
2011-07-18T10:02:37  <amstan> to something like 10 minutes
2011-07-18T10:03:13  *** jmreardon <jmreardon!~jmreardon@129-97-120-105.uwaterloo.ca> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-18T10:03:26  <asdas> thats good idea for now
2011-07-18T10:03:28  <mleise> amstan: that should do the trick :)
2011-07-18T10:12:02  <asdas> What is the problem with leader board script?
2011-07-18T10:15:36  <asdas> There is one trick, how to do ranking ultra fast. If you tell me what is the problem, I can give you the solution
2011-07-18T10:17:14  <HumWum> how is do you calculate the skill?
2011-07-18T10:32:29  <asdas> @amstan: 10 minutes is not enough. Not all my bot files were compiled. Can you change it from 10 minutes to 1 hour ?
2011-07-18T10:32:30  <contestbot> asdas: No!
2011-07-18T10:32:41  <asdas> lol ?
2011-07-18T10:32:56  <amstan> asdas: stuff with @ in front are bot commands
2011-07-18T10:33:08  <amstan> the 10 minutes is the time for the rankings to calculate
2011-07-18T10:33:11  <asdas> ok ;)
2011-07-18T10:33:22  <amstan> compiling is done on another host
2011-07-18T10:33:44  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-07-18T10:34:08  <asdas> ok, but so what? 10 minutes is not enough - check logs.
2011-07-18T10:34:56  <amstan> why do you think it's not long enough?
2011-07-18T10:35:19  <asdas> becouse my bot is not compiled? "Compilation timed out with command g++ -O3 -funroll-loops -c -o ./State.o ./State.cc"
2011-07-18T10:35:36  <amstan> again, that 10 minutes has nothing to do with compiling
2011-07-18T10:35:50  <amstan> the 10 minutes is the interval at which the rankings page is regenerated
2011-07-18T10:35:53  <asdas> ok, but there is some timeout, right?
2011-07-18T10:36:02  <asdas> compiling timeout?
2011-07-18T10:36:03  <asdas> for g++ ?
2011-07-18T10:36:18  <amstan> i increased it so the rankings stay longer in the cache
2011-07-18T10:36:26  <amstan> compiling timeout is on a different host
2011-07-18T10:36:39  <amstan> and i'm not sure how to change that
2011-07-18T10:36:48  <amstan> how long does it take for your thing to compile anyway?
2011-07-18T10:37:59  <asdas> State.o was last file. It takes 10 minutes to timeout. So at least 15 minutes is necessary
2011-07-18T10:38:37  <mcstar> hm, maybe you link against openoffice?
2011-07-18T10:38:42  <asdas> But my bot is not complicated. So another bot will be compiled in 1h maybe with this speed?
2011-07-18T10:39:05  <amstan> asdas: do you have any huge loops with constant time?
2011-07-18T10:39:09  <asdas> what?
2011-07-18T10:39:17  <amstan> huge loops that repeat at a constant number
2011-07-18T10:39:27  <amstan> something like for(i=0;i<100000;i++)
2011-07-18T10:39:51  <asdas> no. I have big loops like for (int i=0; i<ants.size(); i++)
2011-07-18T10:39:54  <asdas> nothing like you wrote
2011-07-18T10:40:11  <amstan> yeah, but ants.size() is not constant, that's fine, it won't get unrolled
2011-07-18T10:40:23  <amstan> not sure
2011-07-18T10:40:28  <amstan> how long does it take to compile locally?
2011-07-18T10:40:40  <asdas> ~20 seconds
2011-07-18T10:40:48  <amstan> and the timeout is 10 minutes?
2011-07-18T10:40:59  <asdas> faster
2011-07-18T10:41:03  <asdas> 10 seconds
2011-07-18T10:41:13  <asdas> yes, timeout is 10 minuts now
2011-07-18T10:41:17  <asdas> i think so
2011-07-18T10:41:27  <amstan> and you compile it with the same options?
2011-07-18T10:41:38  <asdas> i compile it on windows
2011-07-18T10:41:40  <asdas> localy
2011-07-18T10:41:59  <asdas> i mean...
2011-07-18T10:42:02  <amstan> yes, but are you using gcc with the same options to compile?
2011-07-18T10:42:03  <asdas> with Visual Studio
2011-07-18T10:42:04  <asdas> not g++
2011-07-18T10:42:14  <amstan> ... so it might be the funrollloops
2011-07-18T10:42:48  <asdas> but my last version were compiled in ~2 minutes on server
2011-07-18T10:42:58  <asdas> i do not change almost nothing
2011-07-18T10:43:01  <asdas> and now is timeout
2011-07-18T10:43:37  <asdas> i do not add ANY loop
2011-07-18T10:43:41  <asdas> since last version
2011-07-18T10:43:46  <mcstar> i guess bhasker has similar problems, and i might be wrong, but with less optimization, it compiled ok for him
2011-07-18T10:43:55  <mcstar> he should say something on this...
2011-07-18T10:44:29  <asdas> *I did not add any loops
2011-07-18T10:44:33  <asdas> sorry for my english
2011-07-18T10:45:11  <amstan> def compile_anything(bot_dir, timelimit=600):
2011-07-18T10:45:12  <amstan> yes..
2011-07-18T10:45:14  <amstan> 10 minutes
2011-07-18T10:45:18  <mcstar> omg, the same answers at the same time here, and on #lisp: sorry for my english
2011-07-18T10:45:20  <mcstar> lol
2011-07-18T10:45:45  <amstan> mcstar: how did he change the optimization limit?
2011-07-18T10:45:52  <amstan> s/limit//g
2011-07-18T10:45:58  <mcstar> he used -O1 i think
2011-07-18T10:46:19  <amstan> yes, but how? you cannot send gcc options when you submit, they're hardcoded in the workers
2011-07-18T10:46:21  <mcstar> but i dont want to mislead anybody
2011-07-18T10:46:42  <mcstar> i didnt know that
2011-07-18T10:46:50  <mcstar> then i dont know
2011-07-18T10:46:52  <amstan> asdas: do you have a linux comp near you?
2011-07-18T10:47:37  <asdas> near me... no. But i have one dedicated server ~100km from here ;)
2011-07-18T10:47:52  <amstan> asdas: in ssh range i mean, :P
2011-07-18T10:47:57  <asdas> yes ;)
2011-07-18T10:48:02  <amstan> try compiling your thing there
2011-07-18T10:48:09  <amstan> with the same options as us ideally
2011-07-18T10:48:16  <amstan> they should be in the makefile
2011-07-18T10:49:03  <asdas> ok
2011-07-18T10:49:13  <amstan> yeah.. just type make
2011-07-18T10:49:33  <asdas> I must add new files first
2011-07-18T10:49:39  <amstan> yeah, probably
2011-07-18T10:49:46  <amstan> there's a source list inside the makefile
2011-07-18T10:50:08  <asdas> yes i know how it works ;)
2011-07-18T10:50:13  <asdas> i'm not stupid
2011-07-18T10:50:28  <asdas> only my english is not good, not my brain ;)
2011-07-18T10:51:29  <HumWum> i think ur eng is okay so stop blaming it all the time .. it doesnt help to solve the problem at all ^^

2011-07-18T11:03:14  <asdas> so the problem is your server.  The easies think to do: change "def compile_anything(bot_dir, timelimit=600):" to "def compile_anything(bot_dir, timelimit=6000):"

2011-07-18T16:23:55  <amstan> looks like it..

2011-07-18T16:24:31  <amstan> wait.. nvm nvm
2011-07-18T16:24:37  <amstan> i can do this
2011-07-18T16:24:50  <janzert> amstan: actually I'm just rebooting them
2011-07-18T16:24:55  <amstan> janzert: oh, ok
2011-07-18T16:25:10  <amstan> janzert: can i have an ip at one point to test the c# compilation?
2011-07-18T16:25:30  <janzert> sure, if these come back up

2011-07-18T16:26:46  <amstan> why?
2011-07-18T16:26:59  <amstan> we should probably get a real api key at one point
2011-07-18T16:27:00  <amstan> not just ""
2011-07-18T16:27:17  <janzert> not sure, they just don't seem to be coming back after the reboot
2011-07-18T16:27:36  <janzert> amstan: sure
2011-07-18T16:28:38  <amstan> janzert: can be any length, right?

2011-07-18T16:32:58  <amstan> asdas: oh.. right, no c# problem, you were with the timeout
2011-07-18T16:33:09  <janzert> I'll need to kill the current ec2 instance requests and restart them with the new key
2011-07-18T16:34:33  <amstan> you can get keys manually
2011-07-18T16:34:34  <amstan> also..
2011-07-18T16:34:40  <amstan> i should probably clear the worker table
2011-07-18T16:34:48  <janzert> why?
2011-07-18T16:35:10  <amstan> all those api_keys were made with the non existent key
2011-07-18T16:35:24  <amstan> also, it's not like there's any workers there we reuse, right?
2011-07-18T16:35:28  <janzert> the api_keys really have no relation to the creation key
2011-07-18T16:35:29  <amstan> you're going to restart yours
2011-07-18T16:35:36  <janzert> the main server
2011-07-18T16:35:49  <amstan> ok, i guess
2011-07-18T16:35:50  <janzert> and I think McLeopold fires one up to test stuff every so often

2011-07-18T16:47:47  <janzert> not sure, two primary possibilities. One is just general ec2 ubuntu problems, we dealt with those a lot in the last contest. Or possibly more likely I do nasty things with the union filesystem for the sandbox and some race condition develops that causes problems eventually.

2011-07-18T20:25:19  <jbrechtel> amstan: The beta server still says I fail test cases.  I double checked and the zip I just sent to the beta server works on my local server.
2011-07-18T20:25:44  <jbrechtel> Is the worker using a different checked out copy of the git repo?
2011-07-18T20:25:55  <amstan> should be the same
2011-07-18T20:25:59  <amstan> what language? scala?
2011-07-18T20:26:02  <jbrechtel> yes
2011-07-18T20:26:15  <amstan> you sure your local copy works?
2011-07-18T20:26:26  <amstan> we had some issues
2011-07-18T20:26:37  <amstan> apparently all bots fail the test case, they get eliminated
2011-07-18T20:26:48  <jbrechtel> Well, it passes test cases.  The submission status is 'Success: ready to play'.
2011-07-18T20:26:58  <jbrechtel> I use it against bots locally frequently using playgame.py
2011-07-18T20:27:10  <jbrechtel> Let me upload another bot to my test server and verify that they'll actually play a match
2011-07-18T20:28:10  <jbrechtel> But it's definitely getting farther on my local server than on the beta server.
2011-07-18T20:30:21  <jbrechtel> So now I realize that I don't know how to make the server actually start executing games.  Perhaps I need a critical mass of players?  start_worker isn't starting a match like I would expect it two now that I have multiple players.
2011-07-18T20:37:48  <amstan> jbrechtel: yeah, it wants like 4 to begin with
2011-07-18T20:37:50  <jbrechtel> Oh, looks like I needed maps
2011-07-18T20:37:54  <amstan> that too
2011-07-18T20:37:54  <jbrechtel> Ah
2011-07-18T20:37:59  <jbrechtel> running a game now
2011-07-18T20:38:04  <amstan> but why do you have a server?
2011-07-18T20:38:18  <jbrechtel> To figure out what was wrong with scala in compiler.py
2011-07-18T20:38:19  <amstan> you know you can test the bots by just running ./testbot.sh against them
2011-07-18T20:38:31  <jbrechtel> That's what I've been doing to actually work on my scala bot since I couldn't upload it
2011-07-18T20:39:04  <jbrechtel> Since the bot code itself was OK I figured it had to be something wrong with the way it was either compiling it or executing it
2011-07-18T20:39:47  <jbrechtel> turned out it was executing.  the execute command was something like "JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m; scala...."  and trying to start a process like that gave an error
2011-07-18T20:39:57  <jbrechtel> that is shell syntax so that makes sense.
2011-07-18T20:44:57  <jbrechtel> You can see my server here:  http://xmyth.ath.cx:3500  and http://xmyth.ath.cx:3500/profile.php?user=2  is my player with a Scala bot that's working
2011-07-18T20:53:08  <jbrechtel> Hmm...it may look like my bot is timing out a lot...I believe that's because the VM I have that server running on is hammered.
2011-07-18T21:01:25  <amstan> jbrechtel: so what's the error on the main server that you're getting?
2011-07-18T21:01:28  <amstan> failed test cases?
2011-07-18T21:01:43  <jbrechtel> Yes.  It reports that the bot crashed.
2011-07-18T21:01:53  <jbrechtel> Which is the exact same behavior when it was trying to execute the scala process the wrong way.
2011-07-18T21:02:30  <jbrechtel> The only additional information I had was that when I saw the output of the worker that failed to execute it...i.e. from a terminal where I executed start_worker.sh explicitly....I would see the error 'No such file or directory'
2011-07-18T21:02:30  <amstan> have you tried running your bot locally with ./testbot.sh?
2011-07-18T21:02:46  <amstan> i don't really care about the worker, that's just extra overhead
2011-07-18T21:02:52  <amstan> i'm interested in the basic sanity check
2011-07-18T21:02:55  <jbrechtel> let me try that...I haven't used testbot.sh in a while...I usually just use play_one_game.sh
2011-07-18T21:02:57  <jbrechtel> one sec
2011-07-18T21:03:10  <jbrechtel> I only mention it because I suspect that's where the problem lies.
2011-07-18T21:03:16  <jbrechtel> trying testbot now
2011-07-18T21:07:21  <jbrechtel> amstan: it does not crash with test_bot.sh locally
2011-07-18T21:07:24  <jbrechtel> result is: score 11 90
2011-07-18T21:07:25  <jbrechtel> status eliminated survived
2011-07-18T21:07:40  <amstan> eliminated though
2011-07-18T21:07:45  <jbrechtel> it's bot 0?
2011-07-18T21:07:47  <amstan> yes
2011-07-18T21:07:57  <amstan> i think everyone is having the same problem too
2011-07-18T21:08:45  <jbrechtel> Hmm.  It's reporting crashed on the beta site though, for my Scala uploads.  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=312
2011-07-18T21:10:24  <amstan> i don't see any crash
2011-07-18T21:10:28  <amstan> it just says failed test cases
2011-07-18T21:10:35  <amstan> and i think it's that eliminated
2011-07-18T21:10:54  <jbrechtel> That output underneath the failed test cases where it says "turn    0 bot 0 crashed"  doesn't indicate a crash?
2011-07-18T21:13:41  <amstan> all i see: 2011-07-19 04:47:31	Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases
2011-07-18T21:13:42  <jbrechtel> I'm horribly confused now.  Looking at test_bot.sh I can't figure out how it's related to compiler.py at all.  Yet, compiler.py is what I fixed to make my bot work on my local server.  I verified it failing before I made the change and then verified it working afterwards.
2011-07-18T21:14:13  <amstan> jbrechtel: so.. again, i have a feeling they fail the test cases because the test case is too hard
2011-07-18T21:14:18  <amstan> so it makes the bot get eliminated
2011-07-18T21:14:27  <amstan> now.. there's 2 problems with that(from our end, not your bot)
2011-07-18T21:14:31  <amstan> 1. the test case is too hard
2011-07-18T21:14:46  <amstan> 2. the bot fails if it gets eliminated, it should only fail if it crashes
2011-07-18T21:15:29  <jbrechtel> Fair enough, I'm still quite confused why we're seeing different things rendered on my profile page though.

2011-07-18T21:17:07  <amstan> jbrechtel: oh.. that..
2011-07-18T21:17:14  <amstan> it's probably because those errors are private
2011-07-18T21:17:21  <jbrechtel> oh, I see
2011-07-18T21:17:25  <amstan> god.. that is ugly
2011-07-18T21:17:27  <jbrechtel> I suppose that makes some sense.

2011-07-18T21:17:49  <amstan> jbrechtel: i'm not sure then
2011-07-18T21:18:15  <jbrechtel> I was also quite confused why my bot was getting eliminated at all in the test scenario.  I see now there is no food...that would explain it.
2011-07-18T21:18:41  <amstan> jbrechtel: you know there might be a game where there no food
2011-07-18T21:18:46  <jbrechtel> Yea
2011-07-18T21:18:48  <amstan> anyway..
2011-07-18T21:18:56  <amstan> i need mcleopold to clear some things up
2011-07-18T21:19:01  <jbrechtel> I'm not crashing in that scenario though...just not playing very intelligently yet
2011-07-18T21:26:28  <jbrechtel> amstan: Thanks for the help.  If I see mcleopold around I'll pester him.  I still feel like this is a problem with the worker not using an updated compiler.py.
2011-07-18T21:26:41  <jbrechtel> I really appreciate the help.
2011-07-18T21:26:44  <amstan> when was the compiler updated?
2011-07-18T21:26:58  <jbrechtel> My pull request that you merged in.
2011-07-18T21:27:06  <jbrechtel> The last commit...one sec
2011-07-18T21:27:21  <jbrechtel> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/b4de348195c91ae7cfc4e99ae3476915b4d1c32d
2011-07-18T21:27:42  <amstan> oh yeah, no
2011-07-18T21:27:47  <amstan> that won't be in the worker yet
2011-07-18T21:27:51  <jbrechtel> Oh... :)
2011-07-18T21:27:59  <jbrechtel> That's certainly the problem then.

2011-07-18T21:28:35  <jbrechtel> Can you update that?
2011-07-18T21:30:16  <amstan> jbrechtel: yeah, but in a while
2011-07-18T21:30:28  <amstan> actually
2011-07-18T21:30:36  <amstan> janzert: ping? are you still working on the workers?
2011-07-18T21:31:54  <amstan> oh man..
2011-07-18T21:31:57  <amstan> now i get it
2011-07-18T21:32:11  <amstan> how does one do a decreasing for loop where is unsigned?
2011-07-18T21:32:18  <amstan> for(i=7;i>=0;i--)
2011-07-18T21:32:22  <amstan> but this will cause it to overflow
2011-07-18T21:34:10  <amstan> i guess  this works: for(i=7;i<8; i--) {
2011-07-18T21:34:44  <jbrechtel> that will go on forever right?
2011-07-18T21:35:01  <jbrechtel> oh
2011-07-18T21:35:04  <jbrechtel> nevermind
2011-07-18T21:35:09  <jbrechtel> you said unsigned
2011-07-18T21:35:13  <amstan> that one won't, since it wraps
2011-07-18T21:35:30  <amstan> but you can't do i>=0 when you have unsigned since it'll always be true

2011-07-18T22:04:22  <Qua> Good morning
2011-07-18T22:05:03  <Qua> Amstan is there any news on the C# bot 0 timeout issue?
2011-07-18T22:19:09  <amstan> Qua: you mean the failed test case?
2011-07-18T22:19:15  <Qua> Yup
2011-07-18T22:19:24  <Qua> Nope
2011-07-18T22:20:00  <Qua> The issue is that it receives a timeout in one of the test cases
2011-07-18T22:20:40  <amstan> not sure
2011-07-18T22:21:25  <Qua> It appears that your main server might have different settings than the actual servers processing the uploads and compiling them
2011-07-18T22:21:40  <Qua> any chance you could try the whole compile/test process on one of the worker servers?
2011-07-18T22:22:05  <amstan> let me check

2011-07-18T22:42:52  <phillc> Hiya, I am having no luck submitting a a haskell bot. I am getting "Did not find a recognized MyBot.* file." Even though my zip has a MyBot.hs in it.
2011-07-18T22:43:28  <phillc> I'm looking through the source, and I have no reason to think the compile everything script shouldn't be picking it up
2011-07-18T22:45:05  <amstan> phillc: how did you pack your code?
2011-07-18T22:45:22  <amstan> there might a difference if you include it from a folder or not
2011-07-18T22:45:56  <phillc> Are you asking if I have my source in a folder in side the zip?
2011-07-18T22:46:09  <phillc> I am using my same rakefile from planetwars, assuming things haven't changed.
2011-07-18T22:46:26  <phillc> Err, I mean I am building the zip the same way as I was during planetwars
2011-07-18T22:46:46  <Qua> The zip file should contain nothing but pure .hs files
2011-07-18T22:46:50  <Qua> no folders or make files
2011-07-18T22:47:06  <phillc> No folders, hmm, I do have folders, maybe that is it.
2011-07-18T22:47:18  <phillc> Going to give that a try, thanks =)

2011-07-18T22:49:00  <amstan> you have to archive what's inside the folder instead
2011-07-18T22:53:36  <phillc> That is getting me farther, thanks.

2011-07-18T23:23:58  <Qua> haha yeah alright

2011-07-18T23:25:58  <amstan> ugh..
2011-07-18T23:26:02  <amstan> nvm, i can't test it in here
2011-07-18T23:26:07  <amstan> it has to be in a sandbox
2011-07-18T23:26:13  <amstan> the packages are not installed outside the sandbox
2011-07-18T23:28:29  <Qua> how is it testable then?
2011-07-18T23:28:51  <amstan> not sure, janzert's in charge
