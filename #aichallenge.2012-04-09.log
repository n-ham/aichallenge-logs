2012-04-09T07:17:50  <antimatroid> reddit needs a maths lesson
2012-04-09T07:18:12  <thestinger> antimatroid: or you need to remove all the crappy default subreddits :P
2012-04-09T07:18:24  <antimatroid> i'm bored :P
2012-04-09T07:18:40  <antimatroid> still, that page is one big facepalm excepting kicklecubicle
2012-04-09T07:18:59  <thestinger> just stay away from r/programming because it's depressing
2012-04-09T07:19:08  <antimatroid> i do
2012-04-09T07:19:44  <antimatroid> i pretty much do /r/math, /r/bicycling, /r/australia, /r/askreddit, everything, repeat
2012-04-09T07:20:20  <antimatroid> i used to go to places like compsci nonaustrianeconomics etc. but they're mostly dead now
2012-04-09T07:20:57  <thestinger> they die as they become more popular and the ratio of moderators to users goes way down
2012-04-09T07:21:25  <antimatroid> that is true
2012-04-09T07:21:33  <antimatroid> although with those two i think the users left reddit
2012-04-09T07:21:57  <antimatroid> i would move on if i had somewhere else to keep me entertained
2012-04-09T07:22:11  <thestinger> once you get past a certain number of users, it's all image macros and crappy memes
2012-04-09T07:22:27  <antimatroid> i really want somewhere online that microeconomic theorists and game theorists talk if you ever feel like finding such a utopian place for me? :P
2012-04-09T07:22:32  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-04-09T07:22:53  <antimatroid> i've never found them on irc, reddit, forums anything :(
2012-04-09T07:23:14  <antimatroid> preferably the type of people who have done at least undergrad maths degrees
2012-04-09T07:28:27  <thestinger> http://0x10c.com/ this looks pretty cool
2012-04-09T07:28:54  <thestinger> people have already implemented emulators of the CPU, debuggers, etc.
2012-04-09T07:29:38  <antimatroid> my friend was telling me about that
2012-04-09T07:31:01  <antimatroid> sounds pretty cool
2012-04-09T07:31:09  <antimatroid> i don't have time for it though
