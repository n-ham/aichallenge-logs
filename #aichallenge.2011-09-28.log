2011-09-28T02:21:59  <antimatroid> oops on the trapped hills aha
2011-09-28T02:22:07  <antimatroid> it's been pointed out like 5 times
2011-09-28T02:22:10  <McLeopold> ?
2011-09-28T02:22:18  <antimatroid> flagcapper just sent out an email about it
2011-09-28T02:22:22  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-28T02:22:47  <McLeopold> do you want to start review the specs?
2011-09-28T02:22:53  <McLeopold> I'm working on the wiki right now
2011-09-28T02:25:15  <antimatroid> yeah sure
2011-09-28T02:25:28  <antimatroid> do you want me to look at it once you're done?
2011-09-28T02:25:33  <antimatroid> what tutorials need doing too?
2011-09-28T02:25:46  <McLeopold> all of them
2011-09-28T02:25:54  <antimatroid> yeah but what are we doing them for :P
2011-09-28T02:26:16  <McLeopold> well, I was thinking of a master tutorial that should some small improvements
2011-09-28T02:26:27  <McLeopold> but each language would need a small one to get started
2011-09-28T02:26:48  <McLeopold> so for c++, how to install and setup an environment to where you can modify the code and test a bot
2011-09-28T02:27:07  <McLeopold> which means maybe different sections for different OSs
2011-09-28T02:27:55  <antimatroid> nah, i'll just tell them to get code::blocks :)
2011-09-28T02:28:08  <antimatroid> it's a cross platform ide, then if they want to use something they're used to they should be good to go anyway
2011-09-28T02:28:18  <McLeopold> I was thinking of the following for the main one: 1) avoid collisions 2) find food 3) attack hills 4) explore unseen area 5) organize ants
2011-09-28T02:28:36  <McLeopold> antimatroid: that's okay with me
2011-09-28T02:28:49  <antimatroid> i have another one, 6) tracking information out of view
2011-09-28T02:29:04  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-28T02:29:25  <antimatroid> to do so, just make a copy of your enemyAnts/food/hill vectors before wiping them and re add the information for any squares that aren't visible after you read the state information
2011-09-28T02:29:36  <McLeopold> you don't need to tell me :P
2011-09-28T02:29:48  <McLeopold> write it in the wiki with a code example :P
2011-09-28T02:29:55  <antimatroid> yeah okay sure
2011-09-28T02:29:58  <McLeopold> how about a C++ getting started
2011-09-28T02:31:48  <_flag> I'm not sure how much depth you want to go into, but you realize the stuff you listed for the tutorial is like the entire game right?

2011-09-28T02:32:35  <_flag> I assumed that's included in "find food" and "explore unseen area"
2011-09-28T02:32:41  <McLeopold> nope
2011-09-28T02:33:02  <McLeopold> basic instruction to get an ant to "see" food and walk toward it
2011-09-28T02:33:14  <_flag> Anyway, if I remember correctly the pw tutorial just told you to double the amount of fleets you sent to a planet
2011-09-28T02:33:27  <McLeopold> and it sucked
2011-09-28T02:33:50  <_flag> But isn't that the point of the contest? To come up strategies?
2011-09-28T02:34:04  <McLeopold> yes, but these will be the most basic of each

2011-09-28T02:34:44  <antimatroid> tron had good tutorials

2011-09-28T02:35:41  <antimatroid> that's the tutorial i used to learn how to make minimax trees
2011-09-28T02:36:27  <_flag> See, I feel like that's a bit too much
2011-09-28T02:36:36  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm not even going that far
2011-09-28T02:37:00  <antimatroid> like i'll say people want to do path finding and point them towards the wiki pages for bfs and a* search then leave them there to get their hands dirty
2011-09-28T02:37:12  <_flag> Okay, as long as you don't write code for them
2011-09-28T02:37:33  <_flag> I assumed it would be like the PlanetWars one where you were given a starter bot and told to modify it
2011-09-28T02:37:37  <antimatroid> i'll offer pseudo code for something like tracking food information out of view, but not more important strategy stuff
2011-09-28T02:37:59  <antimatroid> yep i am a big proponent of people writing their own code but sharing general strategy ideas if they're willing
2011-09-28T02:38:04  <antimatroid> but i don't mind people sharing tools
2011-09-28T02:38:19  <antimatroid> which i think something like pseudo code for information out of view is somewhere in the middle?
2011-09-28T02:39:13  <_flag> I suppose. The way I do information out of view is just to never remove it unless I am told it has changed

2011-09-28T02:39:49  <_flag> In fact, if I were to update my starter pack it would do it automagically, because it's not in the i/o part of the code
2011-09-28T02:39:52  <antimatroid> how do you make sure you don't add a food location to a list more than once if you don't wipe the old information?
2011-09-28T02:40:01  <antimatroid> or do you use a set?
2011-09-28T02:40:13  <antimatroid> hmm, actually, i think my actual bot uses sets, i could probably just do that too
2011-09-28T02:40:17  <_flag> I have a map, and each turn I initialize arrays from that map
2011-09-28T02:40:38  <_flag> And I don't wipe the map
2011-09-28T02:40:39  <McLeopold> flag: these are things we are telling people are part of the game
2011-09-28T02:40:41  <antimatroid> the way i wrote the c++ starter bot it's not that simple
2011-09-28T02:40:52  <McLeopold> find food, spawn ants, kill enemy hills
2011-09-28T02:41:00  <antimatroid> i think it's at least important to point out to people that if they want to track that information they need to do it themselves
2011-09-28T02:41:02  <McLeopold> we aren't giving away any secrets
2011-09-28T02:41:16  <_flag> I assumed tutorial implied telling them how
2011-09-28T02:41:25  <_flag> If you tell them how the game works then obviously that's fine
2011-09-28T02:41:49  <antimatroid> the tutorials are there to help people easily understand how the game works and get started editing the starter bots

2011-09-28T02:42:15  <antimatroid> we will offer a few pieces of code which are very trivial changes, but beyond there people get to go to town with their strategies within the resource constraitns
2011-09-28T02:42:20  <McLeopold> I'm not going to tell them how to order all ants to gather food in the most efficient time possible, just how to start move an ant in the right direction
2011-09-28T02:42:57  <_flag> Okay, I understand
2011-09-28T02:43:21  <McLeopold> I think at the end I'll point to a few article on path finding, but won't provide any code

2011-09-28T03:06:08  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if you can find a solution to that, we can then use it

2011-09-28T03:06:17  <antimatroid> i'll play around after that
2011-09-28T03:06:35  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i have no idea about web stuff, i'll just do what I can without it
2011-09-28T03:06:42  <eashoka> antimatroid : cool
2011-09-28T03:07:59  <eashoka> antimatroid : BTW, saw some of multi hill maps having hills on water. if I observed right, ants had problems taking those hills
2011-09-28T03:08:17  <antimatroid> yeah that was my bad, i wasn't checking that the additional hills were being added to land
2011-09-28T03:08:24  <antimatroid> i fixed it the other day but some of the maps remain
2011-09-28T03:09:42  <McLeopold> antimatroid: :D https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-battle-resolution
2011-09-28T03:10:47  <eashoka> antimatroid : also some maps seem to have crowded with hills all too close to each other. not sure whether that is a good thing or a bad thing though.. :-) My guess is if they are too numerous and hence difficult to protect, then the games could generate into a lottery where it could get difficult to identify better bots.. (when the chance factor increase)
2011-09-28T03:11:17  <McLeopold> eashoka: we will be enforcing a min and max distance between hills at some point
2011-09-28T03:11:21  <antimatroid> yeah, it has a minimum euclidean distance variable for hills which i could increase
2011-09-28T03:11:34  <McLeopold> the path to hills, not as the crow flies
2011-09-28T03:11:57  <antimatroid> i am considering just adding extra hills per player until the maximum minimum distance from a hill to any enemy hill is below a certain value
2011-09-28T03:11:57  <eashoka> Mcleopold : cool :-)
2011-09-28T03:12:14  <antimatroid> that way the smaller maps will have less hills per player and we can tweak how spread out the end up being in general
2011-09-28T03:12:41  <antimatroid> that's maximum minimum path distance, not euclidean
2011-09-28T03:14:17  <antimatroid> although i think these extra hills encourage bots to be aggressive at the start of games

2011-09-28T03:27:32  <eashoka> antimatroid, mcleopold : what if we let players own the hills they capture ? :-)  (I mean a hill changing sides after a capture)
2011-09-28T03:27:52  <antimatroid> a friend suggested that today, it would be sweet but wouldn't really give rise to games ending very fast :P
2011-09-28T03:29:32  <eashoka> antimatroid : I think they will further encourage bot to attack, make it difficult for defensive bots to win, and above all it will make it easy for better bots to dominate. how do we know that it will necessarily lead to longer games ? I think otherwise as there will be less gridlocks
2011-09-28T03:30:03  <antimatroid> if we did that, i think it'd be cool to have some hills start as "neutral", as in not owned by anyone yet
2011-09-28T03:30:26  <McLeopold> eashoka: that was an idea, but we want the games to come to a conclusion rather than drag on for ever
2011-09-28T03:30:44  <eashoka> antimatroid : yea, sure.
2011-09-28T03:30:49  <McLeopold> if there are irreversible actions in the game, this provide a natural progression

2011-09-28T03:31:45  <McLeopold> the only benefit is to provide additional spawn locations.  the down side is allowing bots to be revived
2011-09-28T03:33:44  <eashoka> Mcleopold : yes, bots who went on attacking and lost their hills will have a fighting chance to enter back into the game. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a not though. ( I think it's good) but you have a point that it will make it harder to determine cut off points.

2011-09-28T12:35:21  <mleise> frame rate is actually a configuration value
2011-09-28T12:35:39  <McLeopold> I don't see it in the jsdoc
2011-09-28T12:35:48  <mleise> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer/jsdoc/symbols/Config.html
2011-09-28T12:36:02  <McLeopold> oh
2011-09-28T12:36:11  <mleise> It is not a setup option, but user configuration
2011-09-28T12:36:53  <McLeopold> can you give me a frame rate and do the duration/turns calc for me?
2011-09-28T12:37:36  <McLeopold> wait... I can use slowest?
2011-09-28T12:38:50  <mleise> yeah if you set slowest and fastest to 10 you get 10 turns per second in any case
2011-09-28T12:39:20  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-28T12:39:39  <McLeopold> I think I'll change the format for the inline maps...
2011-09-28T12:39:54  <McLeopold> and, looking forward to the rewind :)
2011-09-28T12:39:55  <mleise> but you will have to reset speedFactor to 0 if you don't want the user's speed setting to be applied on top of it
2011-09-28T12:40:33  <McLeopold> can the inline config and options be applied last?
2011-09-28T12:41:32  <mleise> They are applied last. It's just the calculation that is based on replay duration and the config values 'duration', 'speedFactor', 'speedFastest' and 'speedSlowest'
2011-09-28T12:41:54  <mleise> speedFactor is what is applied to the end of the calculation and can be modified with the speed buttons
2011-09-28T12:42:27  <McLeopold> do I have to set duration? or do I just modify slow and fast?
2011-09-28T12:43:23  <mleise> if slow and fast are the same value, then duration has zero fredom to auto-adjust the speed, so you don't have to set it

2011-09-28T12:56:35  <McLeopold> because of the -1 later on
2011-09-28T12:57:10  <McLeopold> so I kinda like that the replay shows the negative at the point of death, even though it happened later

2011-09-28T12:59:18  <mleise> would that additional score entry coexist with the bonus array?

2011-09-28T13:00:42  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-28T13:00:53  <McLeopold> your score starts at the number of hills you own

2011-09-28T14:19:00  <mcstar> try printing its version number
2011-09-28T14:19:08  <mcstar> 2.5 doesnt have stringio or whatever
2011-09-28T14:19:27  <mcstar> i remember you complained about this, and you used 2.5
2011-09-28T14:20:27  <UncleVasya> It wasn't me. 2.7 is the oldest I had.
2011-09-28T14:20:47  <UncleVasya> McLeopold: Currently I have 2.7 and 3.1 installed.
2011-09-28T14:22:49  <McLeopold> 3.1 doesn't have StringIO
2011-09-28T14:22:49  <mcstar> python3 has no stringio
2011-09-28T14:22:53  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-28T14:22:55  <McLeopold> it has io.StringIO
2011-09-28T14:23:08  <McLeopold> and it will fail on print statements if you get past that
2011-09-28T14:25:06  <UncleVasya> I understood the problem, thanks. Now I know what I need to do.
2011-09-28T14:27:14  <UncleVasya> And old version of ants could use 3.1? I believe I remember it couldn't too, but it works on my PC well. Isn't it means that 2.7 is currently On?
2011-09-28T14:27:55  <mcstar> McLeopold: told once that "now ants work with 3.x too"

2011-09-28T14:28:18  <McLeopold> mcstar: I'm working on it now, it should be compatible with 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x soon
2011-09-28T14:28:40  <mcstar> still, its better to use 2.7, if he doesnt use python otherwise

2011-09-28T14:37:27  <smiley1983> Also, if you look at my recent commit to github, you can see what I've added for hill support

2011-09-28T14:40:53  <smiley1983> though looking at it now, I realise that it thinks I changed the whole file. So it isn't immediately clear what's been added.
2011-09-28T14:40:58  <UncleVasya> When everybody crashed I tried sample bots. After that I added my one and he survived.
2011-09-28T14:41:20  <smiley1983> that's a good sign :)
2011-09-28T14:42:19  <UncleVasya> I thought sample bots was already rewriten to fit changes.

2011-09-28T15:10:51  <UncleVasya> hmm, aren't they can be re-razed by the bot?
2011-09-28T15:11:17  <mleise> razed is razed. they are gone from the game.
2011-09-28T15:12:02  <mcstar> un-razed he means
2011-09-28T15:12:15  <UncleVasya> in specification I saw 1 point for re-rezing your hills. So it's already old, ok.
2011-09-28T15:12:44  <mcstar> you cant re-raze before un-razing and firt razing it
2011-09-28T15:12:45  <UncleVasya> yeah, maybe "un-razing"

2011-09-28T18:12:37  <mleise> Soon he will start correcting my hungarian as well
2011-09-28T18:13:47  <mleise> Coincidence? "don't make me ban you" -> +o McLeopold

2011-09-28T18:14:33  <mcstar> he is feeling bossy tonite
2011-09-28T18:14:48  <McLeopold> :)
2011-09-28T18:15:31  <McLeopold> mcstar: I still don't have any info on grammer (haha I mispeled that) from you.
2011-09-28T18:15:46  <mcstar> for instance, the little image with the talking circles: im wrapped the other im warped
2011-09-28T18:15:49  <mcstar> is that intentional?
2011-09-28T18:15:53  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-28T18:16:15  <McLeopold> wrapped is to wrap around something, warp is to disappear and reappear somewhere else
2011-09-28T18:16:20  <mleise> that's for foreigners, who know only one of the words
2011-09-28T18:16:26  <McLeopold> it's a funny pun
2011-09-28T18:16:54  <mcstar> i dont feel the same way about it, my fault
2011-09-28T18:17:27  <McLeopold> well, at least you know what raze is, unlike UncleVasey
2011-09-28T18:19:54  <mcstar> "y. It's is good to co"
2011-09-28T18:21:09  <mleise> I repaired my mouse today. had a broken lead right where the cable comes out. short-circuited it for a second when I twisted the two endings together and they touched the grounded screening. it's amazing how much smoke 5V can produce.
2011-09-28T18:22:00  <McLeopold> wow
2011-09-28T18:22:05  <mcstar> mleise: i didnt know what "raze" meant until i was confronted with it here on monday
2011-09-28T18:22:27  <mleise> I heard it in some old warcraft strategy game im sure
2011-09-28T18:22:40  <mcstar> mleise: nono i wanted McLeopold
2011-09-28T18:22:55  <mcstar> sorry for the trouble i cause all the time
2011-09-28T18:23:04  <McLeopold> warcraft 1 is what I always think of :)
2011-09-28T18:23:43  <mcstar> actually, the amount of smoke has little to do with voltage
2011-09-28T18:23:56  <mcstar> what matters more is amperage
2011-09-28T18:24:03  <mcstar> only my opinion though
2011-09-28T18:24:40  <mleise> mcstar: Yes I've been told many times, but I never want to believe it. Anyway, my laptop did a good job surviving this
2011-09-28T18:24:58  <mcstar> McLeopold: i guess its a good strategy to think of warcraft 1 while having sex, but not always...
2011-09-28T18:26:03  <mcstar> mleise: usb has short circuit protection
2011-09-28T18:26:32  <mleise> it wasn't triggered obviously
2011-09-28T18:26:54  <mcstar> i guess the current just didnt exceed its maximum value
2011-09-28T18:27:12  <mcstar> i think the contact was of a big resistance
2011-09-28T18:27:25  <mcstar> it can still dissipate much heat
2011-09-28T18:27:27  <mleise> maybe i should try one of those usb scanners without external power plug on it :D
2011-09-28T18:28:01  <mleise> those that draw 10x the specified current from the usb host
2011-09-28T18:28:40  <mcstar> i had experience with 2.5" hadd casings that didnt spin up on my powerbook
2011-09-28T18:28:48  <mleise> Ok, enough talk, I need to reduce the farting bubble indicators
2011-09-28T18:29:01  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-28T18:29:14  <mcstar> im glad you like the name
2011-09-28T18:29:43  <mleise> I think it is absolutely childish, and just want to remind you of that fact every time
2011-09-28T18:30:07  <mcstar> sorry, i consider it as a devotion to my humor every time i read it
2011-09-28T18:31:21  <McLeopold> mleise: and the rewind?
2011-09-28T18:32:05  <mleise> McLeopold: hmm... that's not a priority right now, but I didn't forget it
2011-09-28T18:33:57  <McLeopold> k
