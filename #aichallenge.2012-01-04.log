2012-01-04T07:51:43  <UncleVasya> If I'm right there is no any official info yet. But from talks here it seems that Asteroids is candidate #1. People was talking about game mechanic. I'm nt sure, but some guys implementing some kind of demo.
2012-01-04T07:52:14  <foucist> ah
2012-01-04T07:52:22  <UncleVasya> no dates yet
2012-01-04T07:52:32  <foucist> darn, i wanted to suggest Sean O'Conner's Slay game
2012-01-04T07:52:38  <foucist> hex-based strategy game heh
2012-01-04T07:52:54  <foucist> well, it would suck if it was only 2 players though
2012-01-04T07:52:59  <UncleVasya> you can suggest it on forums.
2012-01-04T07:53:02  <foucist> yeah
2012-01-04T07:57:07  <UncleVasya> nothing new on github also

2012-01-04T08:00:32  <foucist> heh nice
2012-01-04T08:01:12  <UncleVasya> foucist: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2122&start=10
2012-01-04T08:02:23  <foucist> reminds me of the prisoner's dilemma "ai" contest..  submissions on various algorithms were made by experts etc, but the winner submitted from a regular guy, was the simple 'tit-for-tat' strategy
2012-01-04T08:02:27  <foucist> two years in a row
2012-01-04T08:03:01  <foucist> communication protocol/betray etc might be mostly 'tit-for-tat' by the winning algorithms :P
2012-01-04T08:06:10  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i presented this to the haskell community http://codepad.org/jwtEVBps
2012-01-04T08:07:15  <UncleVasya> I had a dream today where I understood your code. Being awaken I sadly realized it was just a dream :)
2012-01-04T08:07:22  <UncleVasya> *tonight
2012-01-04T08:07:59  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-04T08:08:05  <mcstar> it cant be that bad...
2012-01-04T08:08:14  <UncleVasya> What did they said?
2012-01-04T08:08:26  <mcstar> did-say
2012-01-04T08:08:43  <mcstar> well, they didnt give me a better solution
2012-01-04T08:08:50  <mcstar> but they were interested
2012-01-04T08:09:36  <mcstar> maybe someone will code up something
2012-01-04T08:09:51  <mcstar> anyway, it seems the algorithm doesnt originate from that page i showed you
2012-01-04T08:10:06  <mcstar> it is much older, comes from india or something, from 14th century
2012-01-04T08:10:13  <mcstar> doesnt matter
2012-01-04T08:10:26  <UncleVasya> You mean you want them to include your code to the standart library?
2012-01-04T08:10:29  <mcstar> it seems it is hard to do it immutably
2012-01-04T08:10:37  <mcstar> not mine
2012-01-04T08:10:53  <mcstar> but a similar functioning code is needed besides Data.List permutations function
2012-01-04T08:11:03  <mcstar> but if there are no other code .... XD
2012-01-04T08:11:28  <mcstar> i talked to the guy that took part in writing the original one
2012-01-04T08:11:56  <mcstar> "it was fun re-inventing it for Data.List in haskell"
2012-01-04T08:12:18  <mcstar> "that was a long time ago. it can probably be improved. if you're thinking about those things, have a look. :)"
2012-01-04T08:14:24  <UncleVasya> Is it a always works for programmers? Include ':)' if you want your work to be done by someone else :D
2012-01-04T08:15:19  <mcstar> this is the spirit of the open-source community

2012-01-04T08:56:47  <mcstar> aerique: i have an idea: id make the asteroids some kind of accumulators, the spaceship could fire a given "number" at them, that number identifies an enemy, the bigger the accumulated value for that id is, the faster the asteroid approaches that enemy, multiple spaceships can fire at a give asteroid, so players can balance it, but asteroids have a limit to this accumulation, when this value is exceeded,
2012-01-04T08:56:49  <mcstar> the asteroid explodes
2012-01-04T08:57:44  <mcstar> (and there can be some variations on this theme...)
2012-01-04T08:59:02  <mcstar> maybe after the explosion(whici is more or less random) the parts need some "cool down" time, before ships can shoot at them again
2012-01-04T08:59:31  <ahow984_> although I didn't compete in planet wars, it sounds very similar
2012-01-04T09:00:00  <UncleVasya> no, ver different gameplay.
2012-01-04T09:00:04  <UncleVasya> *very
2012-01-04T09:00:11  <ahow984_> hmm, ok'
2012-01-04T09:00:32  <ahow984_> I believe you seeing as I don't know much about planet wars
2012-01-04T09:01:02  <mcstar> planet wars only had one dimension: time
2012-01-04T09:01:18  <mcstar> and the environment was static also
2012-01-04T09:01:31  <mcstar> (capacities couldnt change,..)
2012-01-04T09:01:31  <ahow984_> true

2012-01-04T09:02:52  <ahow984_> or we're always here ;)
2012-01-04T09:04:08  <UncleVasya> mcstar: did you look at amstans asteroids prototype?
2012-01-04T09:04:22  <mcstar> i just cloned it
2012-01-04T09:04:33  <UncleVasya> me too :)
2012-01-04T09:05:49  <UncleVasya> But I can't launch it now, I need pyQT. And maybe something else. And maybe something more because of Win.
2012-01-04T09:05:54  <ahow984_> so its looking increasingly like xpilot?
2012-01-04T09:06:13  <mcstar> i never played that one
2012-01-04T09:06:26  <UncleVasya> me too
2012-01-04T09:06:42  <ahow984_> I haven't I'll install it now though :P

2012-01-04T09:08:14  <mcstar> i messed up something

2012-01-04T09:08:37  <mcstar> how can i select branches?

2012-01-04T09:09:39  <UncleVasya> The only advance I can give is 'Look for a button Branch' but you are in shell, right?

2012-01-04T09:31:03  <mcstar> that asteroids game seems a little simplistic, id be glad to hear what aerique thinks of my addition
2012-01-04T09:31:12  <mcstar> i definitely think something like that is needed
2012-01-04T09:31:28  <mcstar> but a full blown xpilot game might be too much eiher, i duno
2012-01-04T09:32:07  <mcstar> id like to contribute some tool that makes the contestants' life easier, but i dont yet know what that might be
2012-01-04T09:32:38  <ahow984_> I think I'll wait until its up and make a simple android app for it
2012-01-04T09:32:50  <ahow984_> maybe, depending on my android-dev knowledge at that time

2012-01-04T09:34:18  <ahow984_> It depends on what the site does I suppose
2012-01-04T09:34:23  <mcstar> ahow984_: ok, that makes sense :)
2012-01-04T09:34:34  <mcstar> UncleVasya: something like i did for this challenge
2012-01-04T09:34:52  <mcstar> not that lauch/testing app you had
2012-01-04T09:34:55  <mcstar> something more specific

2012-01-04T09:47:17  * UncleVasya is really happy because there is no anti-paste bot on this channel
2012-01-04T09:48:06  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-04T09:48:11  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-04T09:48:42  <mcstar> smiley1983: as you can see UncleVasya learned haskell since he last talked to you
2012-01-04T09:49:48  * UncleVasya is ver smart. UncleVasya is polyglot.
2012-01-04T09:51:11  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: is the difference between the OCaml ones just in formatting and comments?
2012-01-04T09:51:28  <UncleVasya> yes
2012-01-04T09:52:21  <smiley1983> I like the fact that the first OCaml one has comments, but it seems to have some other unnecessary clutter
2012-01-04T09:52:31  <smiley1983> I prefer the formatting of the second
2012-01-04T09:52:57  <smiley1983> For the Haskell ones, I don't really have an opinion 'cause I don't know it (yet)
2012-01-04T09:53:26  <mcstar> they do very differently the same thing
2012-01-04T09:53:40  <smiley1983> the haskell ones?
2012-01-04T09:53:55  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-04T09:54:00  <UncleVasya> So we can count  'have no opinion' as 0 points to them therefore  2:2
2012-01-04T09:54:28  <mcstar> UncleVasya: well, the said my formatting appealed to him more
2012-01-04T09:54:33  <mcstar> the->he
2012-01-04T09:55:06  <mcstar> and he didnt really said if he liked the ocaml formatting better than the haskell
2012-01-04T09:55:16  <UncleVasya> smiley1983: mcstar and me decided to write next_permutation and show to each other. Our 1st versions was very similar.
2012-01-04T09:55:44  <smiley1983> However, my formatting is inconsistent, so I'm not much of a judge
2012-01-04T09:56:00  <UncleVasya> But after that mcstar wrote a second version. And I unfortunally have no ideas how to improve my one.
2012-01-04T09:56:28  <mcstar> smiley1983: to be clear, he wrote the ocaml, and i did the haskell ones
2012-01-04T09:56:52  <mcstar> now your task is the decide which code is more readable
2012-01-04T09:56:59  <mcstar> to*
2012-01-04T09:57:22  <mcstar> im sure you can interpret haskell code, since it isnt really fundamentally different
2012-01-04T09:57:37  <mcstar> at least the first version
2012-01-04T09:57:43  <mcstar> almost identical to the ocaml one
2012-01-04T09:59:22  <mcstar> UncleVasya: remind me why are we doing this? we agreed they looked bad both, didnt we?
2012-01-04T09:59:35  <mcstar> instead you should ask smiley1983 to write a new one
2012-01-04T09:59:40  <UncleVasya> I know what Smiley thinks now: 'Damn, why the hell I began to talk with these guys?!'
2012-01-04T09:59:44  <mcstar> that was your very first idea
2012-01-04T10:00:00  <smiley1983> lol
2012-01-04T10:00:46  <smiley1983> I'm not sure I can provide useful input here
2012-01-04T10:00:49  <UncleVasya> I'm to modest to ask someone to write something. But I want, it is true.
2012-01-04T10:01:41  <smiley1983> If I end up writing something, I'll let you know, but no promises
2012-01-04T10:01:51  <UncleVasya> So I hoped for this reaction of Smiley when he sees our codes: 'Ahhh, guys... let me show you how master do it'
2012-01-04T10:02:21  <smiley1983> no, I would probably produce something long and inefficient
2012-01-04T10:02:25  <UncleVasya> *too modest

2012-01-04T10:35:00  <ahow984_> althought that would be standard....
2012-01-04T10:35:11  <ahow984_> *although
2012-01-04T10:35:12  <rwest> you can use struct tm

2012-01-04T10:35:56  <rwest> so you just add 86400 to the ts to get the next day
2012-01-04T10:36:09  <rwest> then check if day number is 1 and day of week is sun
2012-01-04T10:36:32  <rwest> and you could also jump ahead that if you are on day 1
2012-01-04T10:36:38  <rwest> just 27*86400
2012-01-04T10:36:46  <rwest> and you skip 27 days of checking

2012-01-04T10:46:28  <ahow984_> updated code?
2012-01-04T10:46:48  <rwest> move case 8
2012-01-04T10:46:53  <rwest> to the 30 days
2012-01-04T10:46:59  <ahow984_> I did
2012-01-04T10:47:10  <rwest> still the wrong answer though

2012-01-04T10:48:08  <ahow984_> thats it updated using intuitive date numbers
2012-01-04T10:48:36  <rwest> ok got it
2012-01-04T10:48:41  <rwest> dates starts at 1901 also
2012-01-04T10:49:00  <rwest> your logic was fine
2012-01-04T10:49:11  <rwest> just data from the problem was not correct
2012-01-04T10:49:16  <ahow984_> >_<
2012-01-04T10:49:33  <ahow984_> thats stupidly misleading from the question IMO
2012-01-04T10:50:11  <rwest> it specifically says it starts in 1901
2012-01-04T10:50:12  <ahow984_> got it :)
2012-01-04T10:50:12  <rwest> hah
2012-01-04T10:50:17  <ahow984_> tyvm
2012-01-04T10:50:40  <rwest> np
2012-01-04T10:50:45  <rwest> got me an answer too^^
2012-01-04T10:50:45  <ahow984_> yeah, but why wouldn't they say what date the first of jan was in 1901 instead of 1900?
2012-01-04T10:50:49  <mcstar> see? c++ even introduces bugs in humans
2012-01-04T10:50:57  <rwest> How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
2012-01-04T10:51:00  <rwest> they do?
2012-01-04T10:51:24  <ahow984_> 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
2012-01-04T10:51:25  <rwest> oh I see
2012-01-04T10:51:30  <ahow984_> thats the first bullet point :P
2012-01-04T10:51:37  <rwest> must be a typo
2012-01-04T10:51:41  <rwest> I am thinking
2012-01-04T10:52:11  <ahow984_> not a typo if I got the right answer by leaving it start at 1900
2012-01-04T10:52:25  <ahow984_> I just said if the year was > 1900
2012-01-04T10:52:32  <rwest> I changed the start to 1901
2012-01-04T10:52:35  <ahow984_> when I was checking to increment count
2012-01-04T10:52:41  <mcstar> what typo?
2012-01-04T10:52:45  <mcstar> the problem statement is clear
2012-01-04T10:52:59  <rwest> I mcstar it gives the first monday of year 1900
2012-01-04T10:53:08  <rwest> but wants you to count from 1901
2012-01-04T10:53:11  <rwest> seems weird
2012-01-04T10:53:13  <mcstar> no
2012-01-04T10:53:14  <ahow984_> clear but misleading
2012-01-04T10:53:23  <rwest> 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
2012-01-04T10:53:24  <mcstar> it says its a monday
2012-01-04T10:53:26  <mcstar> thats all
2012-01-04T10:53:27  <rwest> (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec  2000)
2012-01-04T10:53:37  <mcstar> yep, but theres no ambiguity
2012-01-04T10:53:48  <ahow984_> no
2012-01-04T10:53:52  <ahow984_> in fairness

2012-01-04T10:54:15  <ahow984_> "I just computed 1200/7"
2012-01-04T10:54:17  <mcstar> the problem is with this:
2012-01-04T10:54:23  <mcstar>  (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)
2012-01-04T10:54:23  <ahow984_> jesus, how come I didn't think of that lol
2012-01-04T10:54:26  <mcstar> it should be this:
2012-01-04T10:54:30  <mcstar> [1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000]
2012-01-04T10:54:49  <ahow984_> it should be from 1 jan 1900
2012-01-04T10:54:50  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-04T10:55:33  <rwest> lol it doesn't even matter that it was a monday
2012-01-04T10:55:35  <rwest> on that date
2012-01-04T10:55:40  <rwest> you can set the start day to anything
2012-01-04T10:55:43  <rwest> same answer
2012-01-04T10:56:02  <ahow984_> orly?
2012-01-04T10:56:05  <rwest> yea
2012-01-04T10:56:14  <ahow984_> wierd
2012-01-04T10:56:17  <ahow984_> *weird
2012-01-04T10:56:49  <rwest> i before e except after c or if the word is weird
2012-01-04T10:56:50  <rwest> lol
2012-01-04T10:56:51  <mcstar> maybe they introduced "sunday" after only 1900?
2012-01-04T10:57:23  <ahow984_> rwest: haha, I never heard that :)
2012-01-04T10:59:21  <rwest> mcstar: it's probably to do with every year there is a patern
2012-01-04T10:59:29  <rwest> like monday has 1 this year
2012-01-04T10:59:32  <rwest> next it has 2
2012-01-04T10:59:44  <rwest> and every day has the same patern
2012-01-04T10:59:48  <rwest> since they all shift the same
2012-01-04T11:00:24  <mcstar> anyway, id be glad to hear the answer
2012-01-04T11:00:38  <ahow984_> to the problem?
2012-01-04T11:00:43  <mcstar> that code seems to be particulary like a chore to write
2012-01-04T11:00:52  <mcstar> yes pls :D
2012-01-04T11:01:35  <mcstar> do i really have to run it?
2012-01-04T11:01:39  <mcstar> now come on

2012-01-04T11:02:09  <mcstar> thx
2012-01-04T11:02:11  <ahow984_> believe me, If I did it it couldn't have been too hard ;)
2012-01-04T11:02:12  <ahow984_> np
2012-01-04T11:02:39  <mcstar> i mean i dont see that particularly challenging :)
2012-01-04T11:02:49  <ahow984_> ah
2012-01-04T11:02:59  <ahow984_> no, its a lot easier then the other problems though
2012-01-04T11:03:07  <ahow984_> you'd like PE
2012-01-04T11:03:09  <mcstar> i have 17 solved
2012-01-04T11:03:36  <ahow984_> whats your name on it?
2012-01-04T11:04:25  <rwest> I only have 4

2012-01-04T11:04:28  <rwest> I get bored hah
2012-01-04T11:04:54  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-04T11:05:06  <ahow984_> I made my account about 2 years ago and only have 14 :|
2012-01-04T11:05:18  <rwest> oh, I made mine like 2 weeks ago heh
2012-01-04T11:05:31  <rwest> I have 1, 2, 19, 215
2012-01-04T11:05:37  <rwest> yes random 215
2012-01-04T11:05:45  <ahow984_> why 215?
2012-01-04T11:05:45  <rwest> mcstar has it too!
2012-01-04T11:06:06  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-04T11:06:07  <rwest> I had a puzzle from a company to get an interview

2012-01-04T11:08:34  <ahow984_> mcstar: how did you do 13 and 16?
2012-01-04T11:08:41  <ahow984_> How do you handle that many digits?

2012-01-04T11:10:43  <mcstar> its common lisp
2012-01-04T11:10:57  <ahow984_> lisp.... *shudders*
2012-01-04T11:10:57  <rwest> scheme is a subset of lisp so
2012-01-04T11:10:58  <rwest> yea
2012-01-04T11:11:22  <rwest> lisp treats numbers as lists, so it makes it great for large numbers
2012-01-04T11:11:31  <mcstar> you dont have this loop macro in scheme
2012-01-04T11:11:40  <mcstar> what?
2012-01-04T11:11:47  <mcstar> it doesn not
2012-01-04T11:12:01  <rwest> is it not just a list of digits?
2012-01-04T11:12:04  <mcstar> no
2012-01-04T11:12:13  <mcstar> its a vector of integers
2012-01-04T11:12:15  <mcstar> bigints
2012-01-04T11:12:30  <mcstar> #(324234 32423423 4234354 7657657)
2012-01-04T11:12:30  <rwest> nto much of a difference
2012-01-04T11:12:51  <mcstar> "lisp treats numbers as lists" that is totally incorrect
2012-01-04T11:14:05  <rwest> a vector and a list are not very different
2012-01-04T11:14:21  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-04T11:14:22  <ahow984_> rwest: mcstar: race to solve a problem? :P
2012-01-04T11:14:33  <mcstar> rwest: that was quite some statement
2012-01-04T11:14:39  <mcstar> they are VERY different
2012-01-04T11:14:40  <ahow984_> problem 55
2012-01-04T11:14:51  <mcstar> and i dont see why you keep bringing them aup
2012-01-04T11:15:03  <mcstar> an integer is neither a list nor a vector

2012-01-04T11:21:27  <ahow984_> as a matter of interest, is a 1-digit number considered to be palindromic?

2012-01-04T11:56:19  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-04T11:56:24  <mcstar> first i added n to n
2012-01-04T11:56:27  <ahow984_> I nearly have it to
2012-01-04T11:56:27  <mcstar> didnt reverse it
2012-01-04T11:56:40  <mcstar> and then i counted the bad condition
2012-01-04T11:56:54  <mcstar> i.e. the non-lyncsomething numbers
2012-01-04T11:57:44  <ahow984_> hmm
2012-01-04T11:57:56  <ahow984_> its weird because each of the individual parts work correctly
2012-01-04T11:58:10  <ahow984_> hmm
2012-01-04T11:58:13  <ahow984_> maybe an overflow
2012-01-04T11:58:50  <ahow984_> yes an overflow
2012-01-04T11:59:16  <ahow984_> lisp doesn't have these problems with string to int conversions and stuff ;)
2012-01-04T12:00:07  <rwest> you don't need to convert between string and int to check palindromes
2012-01-04T12:00:14  <ahow984_> >_<
2012-01-04T12:00:16  <ahow984_> really?
2012-01-04T12:00:22  <ahow984_> I thought thered be some way alright
2012-01-04T12:00:28  <rwest> reverse the number
2012-01-04T12:00:35  <rwest> and compare
2012-01-04T12:00:35  <ahow984_> ... how?
2012-01-04T12:01:04  <mcstar> i doint it in haskell
2012-01-04T12:01:06  <mcstar> m
2012-01-04T12:01:26  <rwest> uint64_t reverseNum(uint64_t n, uint64_t m) {

2012-01-04T12:01:31  <rwest> }
2012-01-04T12:01:51  <mcstar> its faster to convert to a string i guess
2012-01-04T12:02:09  <mcstar> did you benchmarki it?
2012-01-04T12:02:10  <ahow984_> lol recursion >_<

2012-01-04T12:02:17  <mcstar> but anyway, it runs too fast to consider this

2012-01-04T12:02:44  <ahow984_> I do. I just can't get my head around it

2012-01-04T12:02:59  <ahow984_> even stuff like to the power of x

2012-01-04T12:07:32  <rwest> lol
2012-01-04T12:07:48  <mcstar> you can have 128bit integers maybe
2012-01-04T12:07:50  <mcstar> not sure
2012-01-04T12:08:08  <ahow984_> unsigned long long is the largest native data type iirc
2012-01-04T12:08:22  <mcstar> different architectures different integers
2012-01-04T12:08:48  <ahow984_> yes, but an unsigned long long will always hold the highest number on that machine ;)

2012-01-04T12:22:36  <rwest> I had it done if it didn't overflow
2012-01-04T12:22:39  <ahow984_> atoi() != array-to-GMP-class() :P
2012-01-04T12:22:55  <ahow984_> rwest: I had it finished before mcstar if it didn't overflow ;)
2012-01-04T12:23:01  <rwest> same
2012-01-04T12:23:14  <ahow984_> like, its 50 lines of code lol
2012-01-04T12:23:31  <mcstar> do you know when i started?
2012-01-04T12:23:38  <mcstar> mine is 6
2012-01-04T12:23:48  <mcstar> so it was quite fast to write
2012-01-04T12:23:52  <ahow984_> lol
2012-01-04T12:23:56  <ahow984_> thats ridiculous
2012-01-04T12:24:10  <ahow984_> but still, you don't have to do all the string to int conversions
2012-01-04T12:24:15  <ahow984_> or deal with overflows
2012-01-04T12:24:31  *** Blkt`` is now known as Blkt
2012-01-04T12:24:53  <ahow984_> but that is undeniable about Ocaml, Haskell, Mathematica, Lisp, etc
2012-01-04T12:25:06  <ahow984_> they take a ridiculously short amount of lines
2012-01-04T12:26:34  <mcstar> i havent used ocaml much
2012-01-04T12:26:52  <mcstar> the last 2 im very familiar with
2012-01-04T12:27:06  <ahow984_> Mathematica too?
2012-01-04T12:27:13  <mcstar> i said last 2
2012-01-04T12:27:17  <ahow984_> man, that just looks ridiculous
2012-01-04T12:27:23  <mcstar> what?
2012-01-04T12:27:33  <mcstar> anyway, in c++ gmp is easy as pie

2012-01-04T13:20:57  <mleise> So here is my problem for you:
2012-01-04T13:20:59  <amstan_> so what's the point of project euler? can you bruteforce a lot of those problems? or do you have to do lots of math first?
2012-01-04T13:21:20  <rwest> amstan: a lot of them are huge numbers that take hours to brute force
2012-01-04T13:21:27  <rwest> like 215 for example
2012-01-04T13:21:32  <pairofdice> You're adviced to find a solution that takes less than one second
2012-01-04T13:21:42  <McLeopold> amstan_: dang, slow again...
2012-01-04T13:21:43  <rwest> there is a solution that can be .1s in c
2012-01-04T13:21:50  <rwest> but brute force is days
2012-01-04T13:21:52  <amstan_> interesting

2012-01-04T13:24:19  <mleise> Your solution must run in under 4 hours *g*
2012-01-04T13:24:20  <rwest> 32c4*28c4*24c4*20c4

2012-01-04T13:24:36  <mleise> rwest: uh... that easy? :(
2012-01-04T13:24:43  <rwest> it's combinatorics
2012-01-04T13:24:45  <amstan_> McLeopold: can we stop apache when it's slow while we debug?
2012-01-04T13:24:47  <rwest> it's something like that
2012-01-04T13:25:04  <rwest> err 8 cards
2012-01-04T13:25:05  <rwest> whoops
2012-01-04T13:25:19  <mleise> 8 cards, and each value has 4 duplicates
2012-01-04T13:25:27  <rwest> 32c8 * 24c8 * 16c8 * 8c1
2012-01-04T13:25:35  <rwest> oh the duplicates

2012-01-04T13:25:41  <rwest> slightly more complicated

2012-01-04T13:26:40  <rwest> mleise: I think that is a wrong answer then
2012-01-04T13:26:47  <mleise> hmm
2012-01-04T13:26:51  <McLeopold> amstan_: iptables is better, and I have the ips from the access logs
2012-01-04T13:27:17  <rwest> mleise: it would be something like that if they weren't considered duplicates
2012-01-04T13:27:28  <rwest> and then you could express it as a factorial anyway
2012-01-04T13:28:04  <mleise> I'm not into math. I have no idea. That is why I brute forced it.

2012-01-04T13:32:25  <amstan_> it should be ants.aichallenge.org
2012-01-04T13:32:30  <mleise> amstan: Is it about steering a ship and shooting incoming rocks?
2012-01-04T13:32:31  <amstan_> if not, we shouldn't allow it to index
2012-01-04T13:32:36  <amstan_> mleise: yes
2012-01-04T13:32:39  <amstan_> mleise: and shooting others too
2012-01-04T13:32:48  <amstan_> wait..
2012-01-04T13:32:57  <amstan_> no, not that boring one
2012-01-04T13:33:09  <McLeopold> amstan_: I was only tailing the tron access log
2012-01-04T13:33:10  <mleise> amstan: That sounds like it doesn't require 2000 units on screen, cool!
2012-01-04T13:33:29  <amstan_> it's where you can rotate you ship, you have momentum, and you can accelerate in the direction you're pointed at
2012-01-04T13:33:49  <amstan_> well, having a lot of asteroids would be cool

2012-01-04T13:35:01  <mleise> so we would program one of those board computers from sci-fi movies that evade asteroids
2012-01-04T13:35:17  <rwest> mleise: final answer: 32!/8!4!
2012-01-04T13:35:26  <rwest> so maybe it is high
2012-01-04T13:35:26  <rwest> lol
2012-01-04T13:35:30  <mleise> rwest: that looks WAY to simple
2012-01-04T13:35:58  <mleise> my computer had to crunsh numbers for 4 hours!

2012-01-04T13:37:11  <rwest> oh I know
2012-01-04T13:37:12  <McLeopold> I came across that awhile ago when analizing pinochle

2012-01-04T13:37:30  <UncleVasya> amstan_: In robocode you are able to determine colors of your tank. What do you think about giving a possibility for contestant to customise the looking of his ship? Only in visualizer, so another bots can't determine opponent by colors.
2012-01-04T13:37:43  <McLeopold> I've already done euler <100 :)

2012-01-04T13:37:56  <amstan_> UncleVasya: good idea, heheh
2012-01-04T13:38:06  <UncleVasya> heheh?
2012-01-04T13:38:08  <amstan_> be able to send a polygon
2012-01-04T13:38:13  <amstan_> and a brush colour
2012-01-04T13:38:24  <UncleVasya> Is it means 'Implement it yourself and be happy'? :D
2012-01-04T13:38:25  <amstan_> as long as it's under n vertexes and they're all within a small area

2012-01-04T13:38:28  <mleise> McLeopold: so ... you have the background to solve the cards problem?
2012-01-04T13:38:30  <McLeopold> and if you crash into an asteroid, you ship should be pasted to it for the rest of the game
2012-01-04T13:38:39  <McLeopold> mleise: yes
2012-01-04T13:38:40  <amstan_> McLeopold: lol
2012-01-04T13:38:47  <amstan_> yes!
2012-01-04T13:38:52  <mleise> And we should have Vipers and Raiders
2012-01-04T13:39:22  <amstan_> oh man, archlinux is awesome
2012-01-04T13:39:32  <amstan_> everything is just faster...
2012-01-04T13:39:37  <McLeopold> Also, 1000 turns for ants killed our workers.  Too much processing.  I'm a big fan of making the game wind down faster.
2012-01-04T13:39:44  <McLeopold> archlinux is awesome

2012-01-04T13:40:05  <McLeopold> If you want even faster, go gentoo, but it's a lot of work
2012-01-04T13:40:28  <McLeopold> amstan_: not a fan, rolling release will bite us
2012-01-04T13:40:44  <amstan_> hmm, you're right
2012-01-04T13:40:53  <McLeopold> I think ubuntu is popular enough that we can find volunteers
2012-01-04T13:41:02  <amstan_> but i would like to avoid that issue that we had
2012-01-04T13:41:03  <McLeopold> and ubuntu server is almost as easy as archlinux

2012-01-04T13:41:19  <amstan_> when we picked 10.10 for the contest and then we had to switch to 11.04 because we took forever
2012-01-04T13:41:25  <UncleVasya> Does anybody really use Slackware or it is just to play and throw away?
2012-01-04T13:41:36  <amstan_> UncleVasya: no dependency management is annoying
2012-01-04T13:41:47  <McLeopold> amstan: meh, whatever

2012-01-04T13:41:59  <McLeopold> we only need to finalize language versions at the start

2012-01-04T13:42:15  <mleise> I have 5_796_870_115.
2012-01-04T13:42:23  <rwest> mleise: been way too long since I have done this sort of math
2012-01-04T13:44:32  <ahow984_> back
2012-01-04T13:44:32  <amstan_> McLeopold: yeah, but you saw that it took us quite a few months to get it going, a few months is a lot for old versions
2012-01-04T13:44:48  <amstan_> and ubuntu package versions are already old to begin with(<6 months)
2012-01-04T13:45:18  <rwest> amstan_: include xotcl imo

2012-01-04T14:35:50  <ahow984_> I should learn something from that
2012-01-04T14:35:54  <mcstar> ahow984_: ill have a gmp solution soon for the previous problem
2012-01-04T14:36:04  <ahow984_> lol
2012-01-04T14:36:13  <rwest> I am doing pe 25

2012-01-04T14:36:17  <rwest> should take a minute
2012-01-04T14:36:28  <rwest> I have fib with my own custom bigint type

2012-01-04T14:36:50  <ahow984_> huh, nice
2012-01-04T14:36:53  <pairofdice> 67 and 97 should be easy
2012-01-04T14:37:18  <pairofdice> and 48
2012-01-04T14:37:21  <ahow984_> 97 :O
2012-01-04T14:37:36  <ahow984_> all of you have done math in college though

2012-01-04T14:38:08  <ahow984_> well you know a lot of maths so :P
2012-01-04T14:38:14  <pairofdice> I really don't
2012-01-04T14:38:22  <ahow984_> then how could 97 be easy!?

2012-01-04T14:39:32  <mcstar> ive been looking around for a bug in c++
2012-01-04T14:39:45  <mcstar> the functional world made me forget i need RETURN

2012-01-04T14:40:02  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-04T14:40:45  <mcstar> ahow984_: http://codepad.org/yCJSFq4K the algorithm is almost like in my haskell version
2012-01-04T14:41:26  <mcstar> the problem with gmp is that it cant make a number from a string like this "000342423"
2012-01-04T14:41:31  <ahow984_> mcstar: mpz_class n(i)
2012-01-04T14:41:36  <ahow984_> what does that mean?
2012-01-04T14:41:49  <mcstar> you get a bignum n initilized with i
2012-01-04T14:41:55  <ahow984_> ah
2012-01-04T14:42:02  <mcstar> you could say this too:
2012-01-04T14:42:14  <mcstar> for(mpz_class i=0; ; i++)
2012-01-04T14:42:34  <mcstar> and the lychrel would make a copy of it
2012-01-04T14:42:59  <ahow984_> my lack of knowledge in recursion is ruining me with these problems
2012-01-04T14:43:49  <rwest> ok 25 done
2012-01-04T14:44:26  <ahow984_> if you have 5 dice with 6 sides, how many permutations can you have?
2012-01-04T14:44:39  <rwest> 6^5
2012-01-04T14:44:43  <rwest> 5^6
2012-01-04T14:44:45  <rwest> rather
2012-01-04T14:44:50  <rwest> or wait
2012-01-04T14:44:53  <ahow984_> bleh, should have known that
2012-01-04T14:44:53  <rwest> not first was right
2012-01-04T14:45:02  <ahow984_> ok
2012-01-04T14:45:03  <ahow984_> ty
2012-01-04T14:45:15  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-04T14:45:19  <mcstar> 6^5
2012-01-04T14:45:26  <mcstar> 6 possibilities repeated 5 times
2012-01-04T14:45:39  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-04T14:45:56  <mcstar> amstan: did you see my proposal?
2012-01-04T14:46:04  <amstan> where?
2012-01-04T14:46:31  <mcstar> amstan: ill get the backlog
2012-01-04T14:47:05  <mcstar> amstan: i have an idea: id make the asteroids some kind of accumulators, the spaceship could fire a given "number" at them, that number identifies an enemy, the bigger the accumulated value for that id is, the faster the asteroid approaches that enemy, multiple spaceships can fire at a give asteroid, so players can balance it, but asteroids have a limit to this accumulation, when this value is exceeded,
2012-01-04T14:47:11  <mcstar> the asteroid explodes
2012-01-04T14:47:11  <rwest> ahow984_: what problem you doing?
2012-01-04T14:47:31  <ahow984_> 240, I think it should be ok
2012-01-04T14:47:34  <mcstar> amstan: i told to aerique but i didnt receive an answer
2012-01-04T14:47:42  <amstan> it's rather complicated
2012-01-04T14:47:52  <amstan> it would be nicer if it was simple and intuitive

2012-01-04T14:48:01  <mcstar> not more complicated than PW
2012-01-04T14:48:23  <amstan> it kinda is, in pw the numbers meant number of ships
2012-01-04T14:48:27  <mcstar> amstan: that idea needs a stiwst
2012-01-04T14:48:32  <mcstar> twist
2012-01-04T14:48:35  <UncleVasya> friend told me a cool joke:
2012-01-04T14:48:48  <mcstar> asteroids alone wont make it
2012-01-04T14:48:54  <mcstar> or if it would, itd be boring
2012-01-04T14:48:56  <amstan> why is the asteroid approaching enemies?
2012-01-04T14:49:05  <mcstar> because you charged it
2012-01-04T14:49:10  <mcstar> hehe
2012-01-04T14:49:21  <mcstar> i saw your mockup
2012-01-04T14:49:27  <pairofdice> If you shoot at it it should go away from you ;p
2012-01-04T14:49:35  <amstan> or explode
2012-01-04T14:49:38  <mcstar> no
2012-01-04T14:49:48  <mcstar> only explodes after it cant take more bullets
2012-01-04T14:49:50  <mcstar> or phaser fire
2012-01-04T14:49:53  <mcstar> whatever
2012-01-04T14:50:15  <mcstar> and the spacehips needs to target multiple asteroids after each other
2012-01-04T14:50:18  <ahow984_> asteroids but you can't shoot directly at people?
2012-01-04T14:50:30  <mcstar> probably
2012-01-04T14:50:32  <mcstar> dunno
2012-01-04T14:50:32  <ahow984_> you need to hit them with asteroids propelled at them by fire?
2012-01-04T14:50:39  <mcstar> i didnt work on the details
2012-01-04T14:50:40  <pairofdice> And But I don't really like the asteroids anyway
2012-01-04T14:51:03  <amstan> i think it would be something new
2012-01-04T14:51:05  <mcstar> pairofdice: i agree, me neither, im just saying, it needs a twist
2012-01-04T14:51:05  <UncleVasya> Year 2030. Vacantion: 'Our company looking for a talented web-programmer. Requirements: Html 7, CSS 5, ability to code a multibrowser sites (Firefox 45, Chrome 23, Opera 33.17, IE 6)'
2012-01-04T14:51:07  <pairofdice> I would prefer just a straight dog-fight, with perhaps gravity
2012-01-04T14:51:32  <pairofdice> Maybe in a an asteroids environment or maze or whatever
2012-01-04T14:51:40  <mcstar> great joke
2012-01-04T14:51:42  <amstan> UncleVasya: yeah, just get IE93.js

2012-01-04T14:54:21  <mcstar> but pairofdice never smiley then
2012-01-04T14:54:29  <ahow984_> well, in a reasonable length of time

2012-01-04T14:56:23  <pairofdice> Anyway, an environment which eventually will kill you if your AI doesn't know what to do would be great imo
2012-01-04T14:56:28  <mcstar> ahow984_: i hope you know btw that the fibonacci sequence has a closed form formula for its nth member
2012-01-04T14:56:57  <ahow984_> yeah, I remember that now
2012-01-04T14:57:09  <ahow984_> I still wouldn't be able to deal with 1000 digits though
2012-01-04T14:57:34  <UncleVasya> mcstar: fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)  ?

2012-01-04T14:59:48  <UncleVasya> btw, that code was on Haskell.
2012-01-04T14:59:52  <UncleVasya> Lazy.
2012-01-04T15:00:05  <mcstar> ive seen that before too

2012-01-04T15:00:25  <mcstar> filterM(const [True,False])
2012-01-04T15:01:20  <mcstar> filterM is like filter(filters a list according to a predicate) but it is non-deterministic
2012-01-04T15:01:39  <mcstar> anyway, that function produces the power set of a set
2012-01-04T15:13:34  <mcstar> ahow984_: http://imgur.com/pZDPJ number of digits in the nth fibonacci number vs n

2012-01-04T16:42:19  <mcstar> you might want to look around in the world of scheme
2012-01-04T16:42:24  <mcstar> or haskell
2012-01-04T16:42:26  <mcstar> or clojure
2012-01-04T16:42:36  <mcstar> in these languages recursion plays a big role
2012-01-04T16:42:42  <ahow984_> I _hate_ recursion :(
2012-01-04T16:42:48  <mcstar> no

2012-01-04T17:19:17  <mcstar> i dont know
2012-01-04T17:19:23  <mcstar> why should have i asked?
2012-01-04T17:19:48  <mcstar> because im not a curious problem?
2012-01-04T17:20:38  <UncleVasya> Because it must be interesting why I pick 34
2012-01-04T17:20:59  <UncleVasya> Beause I don't do Eulers problems.
2012-01-04T17:21:14  <UncleVasya> And even didn't read any of    them.
2012-01-04T17:21:51  <mcstar> soooo why then?
2012-01-04T17:22:11  <UncleVasya> So... 34 might be some meaningful number for me ==> it even can be used somewhere in my passwords ==> it is useful to know somethin about it...
2012-01-04T17:22:56  <UncleVasya> althought it isn't true it could be a flow of ones thoughts
2012-01-04T17:23:28  <UncleVasya> ok, nvm. I realized I'm printing a crap :D

2012-01-04T17:27:00  <mcstar> i have no ida what you mean
2012-01-04T17:27:01  <UncleVasya> I believe it depends of the type of recursion.
2012-01-04T17:27:41  <ahow984_> the time taken for the function mcstar
2012-01-04T17:27:43  <mcstar> a simple recursion is liner in time in the number of applications
2012-01-04T17:27:49  <mcstar> O(n)
2012-01-04T17:27:56  <UncleVasya> Because in every function call you can call your recursive function 1 or more times.
2012-01-04T17:27:58  <ahow984_> :O really
2012-01-04T17:28:01  <ahow984_> wow
2012-01-04T17:28:21  <ahow984_> I thought it was much larger....

2012-01-04T17:51:25  <mcstar> ok, so the black ball can travel on ANY path

2012-01-04T17:56:28  <mcstar> which leaves less space than the diameter of the black ball
2012-01-04T17:56:56  <mcstar> so anyway, these distances(from center to center) describe some connectivity
2012-01-04T17:57:19  <mcstar> if the distance is longer than D, the 2 regions are open to each other
2012-01-04T17:57:48  <mcstar> so after that you only have to find 1 path from the starting region to the end region to tell if ts ok

2012-01-04T18:07:15  <mcstar> the asteroid could accumulate the fire it takes

2012-01-04T18:56:48  <thestinger> an unoptimized sieve of eratosthenes is good enough
2012-01-04T18:56:55  <thestinger> but it's fun to optimize a bit
2012-01-04T18:57:55  <ahow984_> yeah

2012-01-04T19:00:25  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: What does it means?  if(((x[i]-x[j])*(x[i]-x[j])+(y[i]-y[j])*(y[i]-y[j]))>=16*R*R)
2012-01-04T19:01:04  <UncleVasya> I'm trying to understand someone elses code.
2012-01-04T19:02:34  <UncleVasya> ((x1-x2) ^ 2 + (y1-y2) ^ 2)) ^ 1/2 is distance between to points, but here is no ^ /2
2012-01-04T19:02:44  <UncleVasya> And why exactly 16?
2012-01-04T19:03:02  <thestinger> UncleVasya: a magic number
2012-01-04T19:03:06  <antimatroid> yeah no idea
2012-01-04T19:03:38  <thestinger> UncleVasya: probably 2^4, but who knows how they got to that

2012-01-04T19:10:23  <UncleVasya> There is a problem and 4 accepted solutions
2012-01-04T19:12:31  <UncleVasya> All of them used this formula so I thought it is some known one.

2012-01-04T19:28:27  <UncleVasya> mcstar: ^2 goes as ^/2 to the left side => this condition checks if the distance between ball centers bigger than Ball radius * 2 (and 2 * radius = diameter)  => my ball can go between these balls. Right?
2012-01-04T19:28:37  <UncleVasya> To be fair, I need the solution to build my superior bot for Asteroids :D

2012-01-04T19:29:35  <mcstar> A and C must be that far apart for B to pass
2012-01-04T19:29:55  <mcstar> what is ^/2?
2012-01-04T19:29:59  <UncleVasya> thanks a lot!

2012-01-04T19:30:44  <UncleVasya> I think I understood the code now!
2012-01-04T19:32:41  <UncleVasya> thanks again, I'd could not understand that   (x1-x2) ^ 2 + (y1-y2) ^ 2 == 16 * R * R   is  sqrt ( (x1-x2) ^ 2 + (y1-y2) ^ 2) == 4 * R
2012-01-04T19:36:53  <UncleVasya> mcstar: And you asked "why do you think I can help you?". That's why! :)
