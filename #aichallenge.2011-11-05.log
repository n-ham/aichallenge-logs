2011-11-05T03:16:10  <ChrisH> @later tell janzert Here is an idea for game scheduling to consider: rather than pick one seed bot and the rest based on match quality, perhaps it would be better to pick one seed bot, then alternate between high match quality bots and bots that don't require a low sigma (but still have a similar mu). The idea would be to lower the sigma of more bots with one game, but still have half the bots have a low sigma to learn from. Other

2011-11-05T03:39:48  <teriblus> i'm new to the challenge and i'm wondering what is the turn time limitation
2011-11-05T03:39:53  <teriblus> the website says 500
2011-11-05T03:40:01  <teriblus> but 500 what ? milisecond ?
2011-11-05T03:40:18  <teriblus> if it is milisecond, it depends on the pc you are using ...
2011-11-05T03:40:28  <teriblus> can someone explain or redirect me to the information ?

2011-11-05T04:40:49  <Garf> sure. so be prepared for any range of speeds
2011-11-05T04:40:57  <bqf> teriblus: true, but you're going to be using the same hardware as everyone else on the official servers. so the way to go is to have your bot recognize when it needs to stop crunching numbers and make do with what it got up to that point, regardless of the actual amount of operations it managed to squeeze into the time limit.
2011-11-05T04:40:59  <Garf> though it will be very approximately a mid-range modern PC
2011-11-05T04:42:20  <retybok_> I just assume that if it doesn't time-out on my low end notebook, it won't on the server... So far it has worked pretty well :)
2011-11-05T04:42:43  <teriblus> and there is no information about this pc ? ok :) thanks for the answers
2011-11-05T04:43:04  <Garf> teriblus: it will be a sandbox on an EC2 instance

2011-11-05T04:49:04  <foRei> I have a few mechanics questions: What happens if I pick up 2 food in the same turn, will my ants spawn simutaniously (and 1 will die) or will it be queued for the next 2 turns?

2011-11-05T04:50:38  <bqf> foRei: it will be in your "hive", just like ants that cannot spawn because there is an ant sitting on your hill. so yes, they queue up.
2011-11-05T04:51:17  <foRei> Perfect. thx =)
2011-11-05T04:51:53  <bobbydroptable> just gonna jump in and state the obvious. next 2 turns: assuming you only have 1 ant hill
2011-11-05T04:52:17  <foRei> :o
2011-11-05T04:52:22  <foRei> You can have more than 1 ant hill?
2011-11-05T04:52:36  <bobbydroptable> yes
2011-11-05T04:53:46  <bobbydroptable> From the specs: For maps with multiple hills, 1 ant can be spawned at each hill if there is enough food in the hive. If there is less food in the hive than there are hills, each hill is given a priority. The last hill to have an ant on top is chosen last or the hill to have been touched the longest ago is chosen first. In case of a tie, a hill is chosen at random.

2011-11-05T05:08:46  <foRei> I see in the bot input that "turntime" is passed each game. Is the turntime always 500 ms or can it vary? (To allow for more complicated calculations to occur)

2011-11-05T05:11:29  <foRei> I saw this earlier: [09:36:02] <Garf> teriblus: 500 miliseconds
2011-11-05T05:11:32  <foRei> So I assumed it was the turntime
2011-11-05T05:11:49  <pairofdice> All the specs are on the site if you bother looking
2011-11-05T05:11:59  <foRei> http://aichallenge.org/game_settings.php
2011-11-05T05:13:00  <foRei> But it says that some of the settings may be changed, which is why I ask if that is true for turntime aswell?

2011-11-05T07:44:25  <bobbydroptable> i'd actually concentrate on exploration
2011-11-05T07:44:45  <bobbydroptable> right now your bots are just walking about with no clear directive
2011-11-05T07:44:50  <yoR> Yeah, that is more important :)
2011-11-05T07:45:30  <marijnfs> yes you seem to have two or so ants exploring

2011-11-05T08:32:17  <retybok__> The only problem I see is for search algorithms like BFS
2011-11-05T08:32:49  <pedrosorio> bqf: xD
2011-11-05T08:32:59  <pedrosorio> I am using C++ which also isn't fun

2011-11-05T08:35:49  <bqf> seriously though - if you enjoy writing matlab code, more power to you! i for one cannot stand it and i would take C++ over it any day.

2011-11-05T08:37:35  <foRei> Is there something like A* already implemented in the starter bots, or is that for me to optimize :D
2011-11-05T08:37:40  <pedrosorio> that's the only reason I asked
2011-11-05T08:37:49  <pedrosorio> foRei: nope there isn't
2011-11-05T08:37:52  <thestinger> foRei: there's a BFS in some of the starter bots
2011-11-05T08:38:00  <thestinger> used to mark tiles as visible each turn
2011-11-05T08:38:19  <thestinger> for A* you'll have to implement it yourself :)
2011-11-05T08:38:25  <foRei> kk :)
2011-11-05T08:38:38  <thestinger> you can use BFS in a smart way though
2011-11-05T08:38:50  <thestinger> run it from a target across the whole map and you can get distances and pathfinding to it from every tile
2011-11-05T08:41:06  <pedrosorio> i.e.: everyone is using BFS
2011-11-05T08:41:22  <pedrosorio> or collaborative diffusion
2011-11-05T08:41:30  <DataWraith> Like an influence map?
2011-11-05T08:42:59  <pedrosorio> yes
2011-11-05T08:43:25  <DataWraith> ...hm, or maybe more like a brushfire algorithm. I'm fairly new to this stuff.
2011-11-05T08:44:41  <bobbydroptable> can't get my diffusion to work properly =="
2011-11-05T08:44:49  <bobbydroptable> or, rather, it times out
2011-11-05T08:45:08  <DataWraith> Are you already using a queue for it?

2011-11-05T08:49:29  <bobbydroptable> yeh every turn
2011-11-05T08:49:32  <bobbydroptable> probably why it's failing
2011-11-05T08:49:39  <bobbydroptable> hard to do diffusion for things that move about
2011-11-05T08:49:45  <DataWraith> Yeah.
2011-11-05T08:49:50  <bobbydroptable> and for multiple targets
2011-11-05T08:49:56  <bobbydroptable> with different scores
2011-11-05T08:50:05  <DataWraith> You could use a queue to store the next field to expand, and check between fields if you have time left.
2011-11-05T08:50:15  <DataWraith> That's not optimal, but at least you won't time out
2011-11-05T08:50:33  <DataWraith> ...then again you could do that without a queue, too. %)
2011-11-05T08:51:15  <pairofdice> I think I need to start timing different approaches
2011-11-05T08:51:30  <bobbydroptable> well actually my original exploration routine was basically a diffusion of unexplored areas which worked well
2011-11-05T08:51:43  <bobbydroptable> now i'm trying to make it such that explored areas "expire" after a while
2011-11-05T08:52:16  <DataWraith> Interesting. I'm trying to work my way up from A* to more interesting searches such as D* Lite
2011-11-05T08:52:16  <Ellos> guys, got a little problem here, and can't seem to find the solution...

2011-11-05T08:53:17  <thestinger> bobbydroptable: I think I'm going to divide up the map into "rooms" and then only send 1 ant to re-explore an area
2011-11-05T08:53:24  <DataWraith> Ellos: That usually means a bot crashed
2011-11-05T08:53:32  <Ellos> nope
2011-11-05T08:53:39  <thestinger> bobbydroptable: I've been watching the top bots and they seem to leave an event spread of ants that just wander around in a set area
2011-11-05T08:53:42  <DataWraith> Ellos: Try adding the --capture_errors option in the cmd-file
2011-11-05T08:53:47  <Ellos> because when i run it without the java app then it does work

2011-11-05T08:54:12  <bobbydroptable> thestinger I'm trying to achieve the same thing, but i don't like the square grid due to how maps can be laid out
2011-11-05T08:54:17  <Ellos> i'll try
2011-11-05T08:54:28  <bobbydroptable> Ellos: paste the command you're using to run it
2011-11-05T08:55:26  <bobbydroptable> i'm going to try a distance method : put waypoints at X distances from hills
2011-11-05T08:55:40  <bobbydroptable> then figure out a way to push ants around the graph
2011-11-05T08:55:47  <thestinger> oh
2011-11-05T08:55:49  <thestinger> that's a good idea
2011-11-05T08:55:53  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: I'll eventually try to minimize fog-of-war around the hill
2011-11-05T08:56:03  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: that should automatically give me patrolling ants
2011-11-05T08:56:14  <bobbydroptable> thestinger: it is a good idea, except that currently i don't know how to reduce the density of waypoints
2011-11-05T08:56:21  <thestinger> you can put a first tier of waypoints at X distance from your hill, then a second tier
2011-11-05T08:56:23  <thestinger> etc.
2011-11-05T08:56:26  <thestinger> that's actually a great idea
2011-11-05T08:56:28  <thestinger> :)
2011-11-05T08:56:52  <Ellos> i'll pastebin it
2011-11-05T08:56:57  <bobbydroptable> Ellos: good idea.
2011-11-05T08:57:05  <DataWraith> thestinger: Once you find an enemy hill, you can use that distance; the map symmetry will automatically place other hills at the same distance often :)
2011-11-05T08:57:24  <bobbydroptable> thestinger: nice in concept, no idea how that would work in reality
2011-11-05T08:57:33  <bobbydroptable> because it'd essneitlaly be a tree
2011-11-05T08:58:06  <Ellos> http://pastebin.com/ZdnDaThU
2011-11-05T08:58:08  <bobbydroptable> and also waypoints will line up together into a circular shape
2011-11-05T08:58:32  <bobbydroptable> Ellos: paste us the full command you use to run .cmd
2011-11-05T08:58:34  <thestinger> well, I'd be using BFS to measure the distance
2011-11-05T08:58:39  <bobbydroptable> not the error message
2011-11-05T08:58:47  <DataWraith> thestinger: oh, okay.
2011-11-05T08:58:52  <thestinger> so the layout would be based on the map

2011-11-05T09:02:42  <thestinger> well, python gives you the line it happened on
2011-11-05T09:02:45  <bobbydroptable> *facepalm* okay let's try this again.
2011-11-05T09:03:19  <bobbydroptable> wait, maybe it is a bad map file?
2011-11-05T09:03:28  <bobbydroptable> can you change the map to a different map?
2011-11-05T09:03:34  <bobbydroptable> it is crying about width/height thingie
2011-11-05T09:03:49  <Ellos> hmm how come it does visualize afterwards when i use the non live version
2011-11-05T09:03:53  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: That's the visualizer, it does that when the engine doesn't give it good data because there was a problem
2011-11-05T09:03:59  <bobbydroptable> oh
2011-11-05T09:04:10  <thestinger> yeah, there was a python traceback before that
2011-11-05T09:04:13  <bobbydroptable> well Ellos: what i meant was paste the command you use to run the thingie
2011-11-05T09:04:20  <thestinger> you can ignore the visualizer stuff because the engine screwed up first
2011-11-05T09:04:22  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: He did above.
2011-11-05T09:04:33  <bobbydroptable> did he? i just see error messages and the python command
2011-11-05T09:04:47  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: In the chat
2011-11-05T09:04:54  <bobbydroptable> i mean what goes after "play_one_game.cmd"
2011-11-05T09:05:02  <bobbydroptable> not what is inside play_one_game.cmd
2011-11-05T09:05:25  <Ellos> eh i just run play_one_game.cmd
2011-11-05T09:05:26  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: Something goes after "play_one_game.cmd" ?
2011-11-05T09:05:35  <bobbydroptable> well for me i pass it the bot i want to play with
2011-11-05T09:05:44  <bobbydroptable> and i pass command line arguments etc.
2011-11-05T09:05:51  <Ellos> well that is in the cmd already....
2011-11-05T09:06:01  <bobbydroptable> ./play_one_game.sh -e -I "python MyBot.py3"
2011-11-05T09:06:27  <Ellos> i know my way around windows, but this seems to be a python problem oid not something with cmd...
2011-11-05T09:06:38  <bobbydroptable> well it is a python problem
2011-11-05T09:06:44  <bobbydroptable> its a python exception at line 12
2011-11-05T09:06:45  <Ellos> because when i don't pipe it to the visualizer it worsk fine
2011-11-05T09:07:08  <bobbydroptable> basically a null pointer exception
2011-11-05T09:07:18  <DataWraith> Ellos: Hm. You could try upgrading to the latest tools package; Other than that I have no idea.
2011-11-05T09:07:21  <bobbydroptable> error_logs variable is None
2011-11-05T09:07:31  <Ellos> so the java app is a bit picky (can't blame him) and the python engine gives wrong data
2011-11-05T09:07:57  <Ellos> just started with this, yesterday so i guess i have the latest version
2011-11-05T09:08:06  <Ellos> can't it be my python version?

2011-11-05T09:12:48  <DataWraith> ^^
2011-11-05T09:13:01  <bobbydroptable> but take away --capture_errors argument
2011-11-05T09:13:12  <Ellos> bobbydroptable: 13 years old mode, told you so it was not my fault
2011-11-05T09:13:24  <bobbydroptable> and that should avoid the error popping up
2011-11-05T09:13:35  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: I suggested adding that to see if a bot crashed
2011-11-05T09:13:45  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: Helped me with debugging immensely.
2011-11-05T09:14:13  <Ellos> bobbydroptable: the java app just totally crashes because it gets the wrong data so removing --capture_errors doesn't really work
2011-11-05T09:14:16  <bobbydroptable> well that exception he pasted in pastebin came as a result of that command line argument.
2011-11-05T09:14:29  <bobbydroptable> Ellos: its getting the wrong data because the python app is crashing
2011-11-05T09:14:29  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: Hm. Works for me.
2011-11-05T09:14:41  <Ellos> ehhh i will post the other exception
2011-11-05T09:15:16  <bobbydroptable> and yes i'm leaning towards your suspicion that it is a python version issue
2011-11-05T09:15:46  <Ellos> bobbydroptable: thinking so too yes
2011-11-05T09:16:19  <Ellos> bobbydroptable: well here the error without --capture_errors http://pastebin.com/q1ChbaTx
2011-11-05T09:17:28  <bobbydroptable> wait a minute
2011-11-05T09:17:38  <bobbydroptable> the visualizer isn't meant to be run locally is it?
2011-11-05T09:17:41  <bobbydroptable> its a applet
2011-11-05T09:17:48  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: Uh, no?
2011-11-05T09:17:55  <bobbydroptable> no?
2011-11-05T09:17:59  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: It's a java app that loads the javascript visualizer IIUC
2011-11-05T09:18:14  <bobbydroptable> huh.
2011-11-05T09:18:28  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: So it's perfectly valid to run it locally
2011-11-05T09:18:31  <bobbydroptable> i'm just confused because i view my replays in the browser
2011-11-05T09:18:42  <bobbydroptable> i'm just not sure if it is meant to get piped input like so
2011-11-05T09:18:53  <Ellos> well its in the tools..
2011-11-05T09:18:56  <DataWraith> The entire point of the play_one_game_live thing is to visualize it locally
2011-11-05T09:19:02  <Ellos> ye
2011-11-05T09:19:28  <Ellos> so were no step closer to an answer?
2011-11-05T09:19:30  <bobbydroptable> well my play_one_game.sh scripts on unix don't pipe it
2011-11-05T09:19:38  <DataWraith> bobbydroptable: Mine does?
2011-11-05T09:19:39  <Ellos> i'll try python 2.7 then

2011-11-05T09:21:58  <bobbydroptable> try with a different python version

2011-11-05T09:22:51  <bobbydroptable> playgame.py should open up the visualizer anyway

2011-11-05T09:23:18  <Ellos> ah, well i like the visual feedback
2011-11-05T09:23:24  <DataWraith> The live version is identical, except that it pipes the output to "java -jar visualizer.jar"
2011-11-05T09:23:32  <Ellos> you need to add it to the path env var
2011-11-05T09:23:32  <bobbydroptable> i get the visual feedback too, just in a browser
2011-11-05T09:23:39  <Ellos> well how?

2011-11-05T09:30:22  <pedrosorio> they are supposed to be "python looking"
2011-11-05T09:30:32  <pedrosorio> since there are a lot of python scripts in the tools folder
2011-11-05T09:31:04  <foRei> yep, I took that as "python is installed properly"... But yet cmd.exe wont accept "python" as a command (which play_one_game.cmd sends)
2011-11-05T09:31:24  <pedrosorio> because you need to have the python directory

2011-11-05T10:05:47  <Ellos_> well i now also know why it isnt working in combo with my bot...
2011-11-05T10:06:42  <Ellos_> the debugger reroutes the stderr and stdin&outs to itself, this decouples the visualizer from the process and renders it useless, it then gets the nullpointer exception..
2011-11-05T10:06:56  <DataWraith> Huh.

2011-11-05T10:07:26  <Ellos_> yeah i have my visual studio debugger plugging in on it
2011-11-05T10:07:34  <Ellos_> that helps a lot too :P
2011-11-05T10:07:37  <DataWraith> ^^
2011-11-05T10:08:33  <Ellos_> well just have to switch from time to time then... from debug to release in visual studio that is, then the debugger wont attach and i can use the visualizer...
2011-11-05T10:09:05  <DataWraith> Or just use the stuff in game_logs/ with the visualizer
2011-11-05T10:09:30  <Ellos_> aftewards you mean?
2011-11-05T10:09:34  <DataWraith> y
2011-11-05T10:09:53  <DataWraith> But then you don't get to debug it live. %)
2011-11-05T10:09:54  <Ellos_> afterwards is not a problem, even when i have my debugger attached that works fine
2011-11-05T10:10:09  <DataWraith> Eh, okay.
2011-11-05T10:10:42  <Ellos_> but i'm happy now, i can finally start to do something about this terrible pathfinding algorithm
2011-11-05T10:10:50  <DataWraith> ^^
2011-11-05T10:11:02  <DataWraith> I just finished my A* implementation. Now to actually make the bot use it...
2011-11-05T10:11:37  <Ellos_> think i'm going for a data-oriented approach with of course collaborative diffusion at least, gonna try that

2011-11-05T10:12:52  <DataWraith> I'll eventually extend it to D* Light, which seems a good fit for the contest
2011-11-05T10:13:16  <DataWraith> Once you have fast path-finding you can start to think about clever strategies :)

2011-11-05T10:14:52  <fasteddie__> is the command simply the exe, replacing  "java -jar mybot.jar" with "mybot.exe"?
2011-11-05T10:15:14  <Ellos_> yep its as easy as that
2011-11-05T10:15:25  <fasteddie__> and then you can attach to the running process with VS?
2011-11-05T10:15:36  <Ellos_> well you need to trigger it in main
2011-11-05T10:15:58  <fasteddie__> how do you trigger it?

2011-11-05T10:16:41  <Ellos_> just keep in mind that the visualizer uses the same method when its trying to do it live, so you can't use both
2011-11-05T10:17:17  <fasteddie__> ok thanks
2011-11-05T10:17:23  <fasteddie__> i might switch from java then
2011-11-05T10:19:04  <Ellos_> why?
2011-11-05T10:19:20  <Ellos_> easier to work with?
2011-11-05T10:19:23  <fasteddie__> well c# is my language of choice
2011-11-05T10:19:41  <fasteddie__> but i decided not to use it yet because the tutorial was in java and im working on a mac

2011-11-05T10:29:22  <DataWraith> Ellos_: The starter package does that for me.
2011-11-05T10:29:30  <Ellos_> grr
2011-11-05T10:29:34  <mcstar> what do you mean "handle"?
2011-11-05T10:29:36  <Ellos_> the c# package can't do shit

2011-11-05T10:30:17  <Ellos_> just don't look at the absolutes but more at the relative radius
2011-11-05T10:30:22  <pedrosorio_> the c# doesn't come with a function to compute the location when you move in one direction?

2011-11-05T10:31:23  <mcstar> Ellos_: the only "tricky" part is determining the direction from touching start-end locations
2011-11-05T10:31:38  <Ellos_> yeah
2011-11-05T10:31:39  <DataWraith> while row > Rows; row -= Rows; while row < 0; row += Rows
2011-11-05T10:31:42  <DataWraith> Same for col.
2011-11-05T10:31:56  <mcstar> DataWraith: while?
2011-11-05T10:32:13  <DataWraith> Go's Modulo doesn't work as nicely for this.
2011-11-05T10:32:14  <mcstar> there cant really be more than 1 tile offset
2011-11-05T10:32:21  <mcstar> you dont need while imo

2011-11-05T10:32:38  <DataWraith> mcstar: But if generalizes to while, so why not be general?
2011-11-05T10:32:51  <mcstar> general usually implies slower
2011-11-05T10:32:56  <mcstar> but its marginal
2011-11-05T10:32:59  <Ellos_> ^^
2011-11-05T10:33:18  <DataWraith> Yeah. But I'd rather use a different algorithm than fiddle with things adding/removing single assembly instructions...
2011-11-05T10:33:59  <mcstar> oh, im not fiddling on the instruction level, only on the algorithmic abstarction level
2011-11-05T10:34:17  <DataWraith> Besides that's just how the starter package does it, and I haven't bothered to change it.
2011-11-05T10:34:32  <mcstar> so
2011-11-05T10:34:37  <mcstar> 2 turn it is
2011-11-05T10:34:40  <antimatroid> change all the things
2011-11-05T10:34:40  <mcstar> turns*
2011-11-05T10:34:51  <Ellos_> but did your starter package work aka do more than repeat two movements over and over again
2011-11-05T10:35:10  <DataWraith> I'm using Go. It has a fairly high quality starter package.
2011-11-05T10:35:17  <Ellos_> thats what the c# one does....
2011-11-05T10:35:27  <DataWraith> It included collision detection and makes the ants move randomly otherwise.
2011-11-05T10:35:53  <Ellos_> hmm so you've already got tons of extra code to work with...
2011-11-05T10:36:00  <DataWraith> Yeah.
2011-11-05T10:36:17  <DataWraith> It even has a DoInRadius function. You pass in a closure and it executes it once for every square in a given radius.
2011-11-05T10:36:39  <Ellos_> could be interesting to analyze the go package then
2011-11-05T10:36:50  <DataWraith> I'm mostly using it to learn Go. ^^
2011-11-05T10:36:58  <Ellos_> haha
2011-11-05T10:37:03  <DataWraith> Be warned though, the Go language is still young and changes weekly.

2011-11-05T10:47:14  <pedrosorio_> yeah, many of the bots at low levels are just recently uploaded
2011-11-05T10:47:59  <fasteddie__> my java tutorial bot modified to forget razed hills got to about rank 360

2011-11-05T10:48:52  <fasteddie__> well in the tutorial you can copy/paste the code to remember them ;)
2011-11-05T10:49:28  <fasteddie__> my newly built a* bot doesn't get very far.. times out or crashes.. so the tutorial bot is a lot better than my own crap right now
2011-11-05T10:49:44  <Ellos_> hahaha know what you mean, sadly....
2011-11-05T10:49:48  <DataWraith> The Go starter doesn't keep track of them, because they are sent every turn anyway. But I want to extrapolate hill positions based on map symmetry.
2011-11-05T10:51:00  <mcstar> you are advised to track them, cause you can easily lose sight of enemy hills
2011-11-05T10:51:48  <DataWraith> Yeah, will have to add that to my ToDo list.
2011-11-05T10:52:30  <fasteddie__> right now im building in code to track my ants over multiple turns so i wont have to recalculate paths all the time and they don't get stuck between two equally important goals
2011-11-05T10:52:39  <DataWraith> Yup, still need to do that myself.
2011-11-05T10:52:59  <DataWraith> The Ruby starter package makes that easy, but it's non-trivial for Go.

2011-11-05T11:00:56  <mcstar> hm, valgrind + kcachegrind are nice applications
2011-11-05T11:01:11  <hjax> mcstar, i know that but inorder to explore properly i need my bot to realize that it has to go in straight lines without turning back
2011-11-05T11:01:27  <pedrosorio_> poor bot :(
2011-11-05T11:01:28  <pedrosorio_> xD
2011-11-05T11:01:46  <mcstar> hjax: and not all maps are "maze" maps, you have to decide which is which
2011-11-05T11:01:49  <pedrosorio_> it's just afraid of the dark..
2011-11-05T11:02:22  <hjax> mcstar: true, ill need to detect maze maps possibly
2011-11-05T11:02:54  <mcstar> i was thinking of establishing some base-line, that ants push outwards, succesively, as they pass it, and it will stop if it gets too thin, or encounters an enemy
2011-11-05T11:03:03  <mcstar> and to the base line the ants would rush
2011-11-05T11:03:07  <mcstar> up to*
2011-11-05T11:03:30  <hjax> mcstar, thats clever, and then maybe have ants patrol around withing the border to get food
2011-11-05T11:03:52  <hjax> ithin*
2011-11-05T11:03:54  <DataWraith> I was thinking about actually doing choke-point detection.
2011-11-05T11:03:55  <hjax> within*
2011-11-05T11:04:04  <DataWraith> Then your ants can rope off the area and everything inside is safe.
2011-11-05T11:04:17  <hjax> that works too
2011-11-05T11:04:30  <mcstar> DataWraith: you need that especially if your really want to control battles
2011-11-05T11:04:35  <mcstar> -r
2011-11-05T11:04:45  <DataWraith> Yeah.
2011-11-05T11:06:40  <mcstar> using stl vectors for this game tree stuff is a bad idea
2011-11-05T11:06:42  <pedrosorio_> controlling choke points is the future of this game
2011-11-05T11:06:55  <pedrosorio_> mcstar vs STL once again
2011-11-05T11:06:57  <mcstar> pedrosorio_: it was done before
2011-11-05T11:06:57  <pedrosorio_> :P
2011-11-05T11:07:11  <pedrosorio_> controlling choke points?
2011-11-05T11:07:14  <pedrosorio_> by whom?
2011-11-05T11:07:18  <mcstar> thinking
2011-11-05T11:07:39  <DataWraith> It's kinda non-trivial to even detect choke-points.
2011-11-05T11:07:55  <pedrosorio_> mcstar: thinking about it?
2011-11-05T11:08:04  <pedrosorio_> I have thought about many things =P
2011-11-05T11:08:07  <mcstar> i think it was flagcrapper
2011-11-05T11:08:41  <mcstar> he nicely hold the choke points, and from them, applied pressure to the ants in the open area
2011-11-05T11:10:00  <mcstar> DataWraith: not that hard, i had an algorithm, that partitioned the water into separate chunks
2011-11-05T11:10:11  <mcstar> and i had access to the skirts of these ponds
2011-11-05T11:10:32  <mcstar> and from that you can easily calculate "chokes"
2011-11-05T11:10:38  <DataWraith> Hmyeah.
2011-11-05T11:10:55  <DataWraith> I was thinking along the lines of a brushfire from the water outward, and find the minimum value.
2011-11-05T11:11:01  <mcstar> that was my very first way of navigation
2011-11-05T11:11:21  <DataWraith> mcstar: Cool.
2011-11-05T11:11:36  <mcstar> my ants would go straigt lines to whereever they wanted, if they hit water, they would slide on the edge of it
2011-11-05T11:12:19  <mcstar> the usefulness of the method was not proportional to the time i spent on it
2011-11-05T11:12:32  <DataWraith> Heh.

2011-11-05T11:25:09  <zorun> is there an ocaml coder here? I'm trying to run my bot with the interpreter instead of compiling it
2011-11-05T11:25:13  <Extrarius> heh, I had been wondering why my pathfinding was taking 60+ passes to conveerge when before it was usually taking  at most 5 - turns out having one loop stepping things forward and another corrupting everything makes convergance difficult

2011-11-05T11:33:35  <hjax> jix: is A* much better than bfs?
2011-11-05T11:34:00  <Extrarius> hjax: It will expand equal or fewer nodes per path
2011-11-05T11:34:01  <BamX> hjax: i think so
2011-11-05T11:34:05  <jix> hjax: I havent implemented either yet... but if you only look at the nodes expanded yes, a lot
2011-11-05T11:34:20  <jix> especially if your heuristic gives you good estimates
2011-11-05T11:34:31  <Extrarius> bfs and dfs are the brute force graph searches
2011-11-05T11:34:44  <hjax> jix: A* is probably going to take longer though, and python is slow, so i think ill end up just using bfs
2011-11-05T11:35:40  <Antimony> I've been using BFS but I plan to give influence maps a try
2011-11-05T11:35:51  <DataWraith> Well, technically A* should always be faster than bfs
2011-11-05T11:35:58  <hjax> antimoney, how is it working for you?
2011-11-05T11:36:01  <fasteddie__> why would a* be slower than bfs?
2011-11-05T11:36:04  <Antimony> well
2011-11-05T11:36:14  <hjax> Really datawraith? O.o
2011-11-05T11:36:18  <fasteddie__> only if calculating the heuristic takes a lot of time?
2011-11-05T11:36:19  <Extrarius> hjax: If you're using python, you'd probably do better to rewrite the final version into C. That is my plan, anyways. Python is great for prototyping and when time doesn't matter, but since there is a time limit...
2011-11-05T11:36:19  <Antimony> my old bot got ranked 130 with only BFS
2011-11-05T11:36:24  <Antimony> but my new bot sucks

2011-11-05T11:36:40  <DataWraith> A* is BFS with fewer nodes expanded.
2011-11-05T11:36:43  <Antimony> use C++
2011-11-05T11:36:45  <DataWraith> So you have to do less work.
2011-11-05T11:36:51  <Antimony> it's nicer to code in and just as efficient
2011-11-05T11:37:08  <hjax> i dont know C++ either
2011-11-05T11:37:12  <Antimony> oh well

2011-11-05T11:38:01  <Extrarius> python isn't bad, it's just slower.
2011-11-05T11:38:07  <hjax> true
2011-11-05T11:38:08  <Antimony> I think the main problem with my current bot is that the defence strategy I implemented leads to many ants sitting idle around the mound

2011-11-05T11:52:14  <Antimony> and I eventually traced it down to a subtle bug that caused infinite loops
2011-11-05T11:52:16  <Rinum> timeout return code?
2011-11-05T11:52:19  <Rinum> hmm...
2011-11-05T11:52:37  <Antimony> you need to check how much time is left and if there's not much time left, return early
2011-11-05T11:52:41  <hjax> Rinum: yeah just quit addressing ants if you start to get low on time
2011-11-05T11:52:45  <fasteddie__> i had some dumb bugs causing some turns to suddenly take over 5 seconds while most only took 50ms

2011-11-05T11:52:47  <Antimony> to be safe, leave at least 30ms
2011-11-05T11:52:49  <Minthos> at the top of my pathfinding code, I check against remaining time and return null if it's less than 20%
2011-11-05T11:53:14  <Rinum> I guess I could give that a tr
2011-11-05T11:53:15  <Antimony> My bot is set to return after 95% and it's timeouted once on the server

2011-11-05T11:53:26  <hjax> Rinum: your bot is really smart, i love hot it makes formations to capture hills and then quickly disperses
2011-11-05T11:54:01  <Rinum> hjax: thanks, I still have yet to create a better offensive strategy (right now they just attack in single file lines)
2011-11-05T11:54:27  <Antimony> That only helps if teh formatiosn formed are actually any good
2011-11-05T11:54:33  <yoden-cloud> writing good attack logic is hard...
2011-11-05T11:54:38  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-05T11:54:42  <yoden-cloud> i'm just making my ants run away and forage more for now :X
2011-11-05T11:54:51  <Antimony> single file lines are the worst possible,, but they happen naturally in most algorithms
2011-11-05T11:54:52  <hjax> Rinum: lines work fine in many cases
2011-11-05T11:55:09  <Antimony> even 2 ants can defeat an entire line without losses
2011-11-05T11:55:10  <yoden-cloud> until someone puts two defensive ants in front of your line
2011-11-05T11:55:14  <burny> 2ants can defend against an infinitely long single file line
2011-11-05T11:55:14  <hjax> Antimony: only if another bot can counter lines
2011-11-05T11:55:17  <Rinum> that's true
2011-11-05T11:55:23  <Antimony> most bots do though

2011-11-05T11:55:53  <Antimony> te C++ starter bot uses clock() on windows and gettimeofday on Linux
2011-11-05T11:55:56  <mcstar> gettimeofday has usec precision
2011-11-05T11:56:01  <burny> ellos: sqrt(55)
2011-11-05T11:56:17  <Ellos_> its 77 according to the game settings page
2011-11-05T11:56:20  <Antimony> though it really should be using QueryPerformanceCOunter on windows
2011-11-05T11:56:50  <ejls> Yes, but clock return the processor time used, gettimeofday, the real time elapsed, isn't it different ?
2011-11-05T11:57:02  <Antimony> well the actual timing is in the python code
2011-11-05T11:57:07  <Antimony> why not go check which it is

2011-11-05T12:03:27  <Antimony> The problem is that it decides the level of defence based on how many ants it has
2011-11-05T12:03:34  <luizribeiro> twymer: lol, indeed
2011-11-05T12:03:35  <Rinum> twymer: lol exactly, it isn't a perfect strat since it requires a lot of ants
2011-11-05T12:03:37  <Antimony> when it has only a few ants left, it sends thme out to try to get more food
2011-11-05T12:03:45  <pedrosorio_> it's a bit silly
2011-11-05T12:03:49  <pedrosorio_> in my opinion
2011-11-05T12:04:00  <Rinum> it is silly, but it's still cool =P
2011-11-05T12:04:02  <twymer> i think he kept way too much defense there for most of the game
2011-11-05T12:04:02  <pedrosorio_> he needs to adapt it so that he'll have more ants gathering in the beginning
2011-11-05T12:04:13  <pedrosorio_> and when he has a massive force
2011-11-05T12:04:14  <pedrosorio_> THEN
2011-11-05T12:04:15  <twymer> i've seen some pretty good success to keeping 4-5 hanging around
2011-11-05T12:04:18  <pedrosorio_> he can worry about defense
2011-11-05T12:04:35  <twymer> which mostly just stops a couple ants from coming in like happened to him

2011-11-05T12:05:05  <Antimony> yeah, my brilliant defence ideas turn out to not work in the real world
2011-11-05T12:05:06  <fasteddie__> i think you should calculate threat based on number of enemy ants moving in direction of nest or in vicinity of nest
2011-11-05T12:05:32  <Antimony> I'm planning to create a system where a hill sends an alarm when enemy ants get near
2011-11-05T12:05:37  <Antimony> and all nearby ants rush to defend
2011-11-05T12:05:41  <pedrosorio_> that's nice also
2011-11-05T12:05:55  <pedrosorio_> but may not be enough
2011-11-05T12:06:04  <pedrosorio_> if too many ants
2011-11-05T12:06:08  <pedrosorio_> attack you suddenly
2011-11-05T12:06:10  <Antimony> at least it will probably be better than the current system
2011-11-05T12:07:05  <hjax> hmmm i think that my cool queue system that im building will end up being really slow and garbage
2011-11-05T12:07:30  <hjax> it deals with creating long strings, and manipulating them, and storing them in lists
2011-11-05T12:07:51  <pedrosorio_> strings?
2011-11-05T12:07:59  <Rinum> hjax: are you using python?

2011-11-05T12:08:53  <hjax> Rinum; maybe store the strings in the real queue module then?
2011-11-05T12:09:26  <pedrosorio_> what strings?
2011-11-05T12:09:36  <pedrosorio_> strings of ants?
2011-11-05T12:09:49  <hjax> because the queue needs to have 4 peices of data for each ant in the queue, but im only using the queue for exploration/maze solving
2011-11-05T12:10:47  <hjax> pedrosorio_: a string consisting of an ants current location, where it is headed, which direction it is coming from, and any moves that are in the queue
2011-11-05T12:11:09  <pedrosorio_> but why would you use a string to store that kind of information?
2011-11-05T12:11:29  <hjax> because i need to store it between turns and dont want to nest lists

2011-11-05T12:15:17  <Ellos_> isn't that where objects are for...
2011-11-05T12:17:16  * hjax well im doing it within a class.... but idk how to dynamicly make classes based on my number of ants, or how to keep track of ants besides with their current location
2011-11-05T12:17:21  <pedrosorio_> isn't that what structs are for?
2011-11-05T12:17:27  <pedrosorio_> (lol)
2011-11-05T12:17:37  * hjax is doing it wrong
2011-11-05T12:18:51  <Extrarius> hjax: Assign ants and ID when you're first told about them, and store two dictionary mapping location to id and id to location, then in your 'give order' function, update both. When you see a dead ant, if it is in the location of one of yours, delete it from your dictionaries
2011-11-05T12:19:24  <Minthos> hjax: a class is a template for objects
2011-11-05T12:19:42  <Minthos> hjax: so what you want is not to make a new class for each ant, but a new object of the ant class for each ant
2011-11-05T12:20:19  <hjax> i have one class, and ti just keeps a list of the strings, im not reinitializing the class for each ant
2011-11-05T12:20:54  <Minthos> well you might want to consider making an ant class and instantiate it for each ant
2011-11-05T12:21:17  <hjax> the strings contain info on each ant that has something it should be doing, and any other ants are processed after  moves are assigned to the queued ants
2011-11-05T12:21:27  <Minthos> ant the location is indeed the only way to track ants, but you need to take into account that they move around and die now and then
2011-11-05T12:21:42  <hjax> Minthos: wouldnt that be just as slow as using my strings method?
2011-11-05T12:22:15  <Extrarius> hjax: you want a class something like "SingleAnt" and make a new instance each time you get a new ant, and that class manages a single ant
2011-11-05T12:22:18  <Minthos> hjax: I don't know, storing data in strings is usually slower than storing it in object properties
2011-11-05T12:22:36  <Extrarius> hjax: manipulating numbers as strings is much slower than manipulating them as integers
2011-11-05T12:23:35  <hjax> but how would i keep creating new instances of a class? because when i initialize it i have to give it a name that i refer to it as, and idk how to come up with a dynamic one for each ant
2011-11-05T12:24:11  <mcstar> class -> instantiation -> object
2011-11-05T12:24:14  <Extrarius> hjax: what language?
2011-11-05T12:24:17  <hjax> python
2011-11-05T12:24:38  <jbroman> hjax: You likely want to use a list or some other data structure.
2011-11-05T12:25:08  <jbroman> The docs are here: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html but any Python tutorial will give you a nicer explanation.
2011-11-05T12:25:17  <hjax> when i initialize it dont i have to do name = class(), the do name.function(stuff) to do stuff
2011-11-05T12:25:20  <mcstar> anyway, from watching ST: TNG 2x21: Peak Performance can anyone greatly profit
2011-11-05T12:25:57  <hjax> well here is my (unfinished) queue system http://pastebin.com/pavR3HK3
2011-11-05T12:27:16  <hjax> i was about to write something to update the strings as ants move
2011-11-05T12:28:01  <fasteddie__> mcstar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goDrSnTc6ag
2011-11-05T12:29:00  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-05T12:29:04  <pedrosorio_> hjax: the main thing here is that manipulating strings that contain data is far from optimal in terms of efficiency
2011-11-05T12:29:17  <pedrosorio_> and if you are using python you have to take that into account
2011-11-05T12:29:34  <mcstar> but that voice is annyoing

2011-11-05T12:29:46  <hjax> pedrosorio_: that is roughly half of my code atm, and idk how to do it the right/fast way
2011-11-05T12:30:07  <fasteddie__> terribly annoying makes me think of starship troopers
2011-11-05T12:30:47  <pedrosorio_> well, as long as you have high-level functions which are independent of your underlying representation of ants
2011-11-05T12:30:51  <pedrosorio_> (in this case strings)
2011-11-05T12:31:00  <pedrosorio_> you can rewrite the low-level functions later
2011-11-05T12:32:19  <hjax> so this code should work, but just not efficiently?

2011-11-05T14:06:24  <mcstar> and faster to write than using plain c

2011-11-05T14:10:45  <DataWraith> ikaros: The DebugImage thing is broken
2011-11-05T14:10:58  <DataWraith> ikaros: I had to make quite a few changes to get it to work
2011-11-05T14:11:38  <DataWraith> ikaros: Or at least write out an image, that's still kind-of wrong
2011-11-05T14:11:52  <ikaros> ok
2011-11-05T14:12:09  <ikaros> because im new to Go and didnt understand that function
2011-11-05T14:12:18  <ikaros> i guess ill skip that for now
2011-11-05T14:12:25  <DataWraith> ikaros: It's quite elegant, actually, if it works as supposed.
2011-11-05T14:12:52  <ikaros> i believe that :) just dont get it hehe
2011-11-05T14:13:04  <DataWraith> ikaros: It basically makes a PNG of the map as your bot sees it, by defining a color for every item in the map you can currently see

2011-11-05T14:13:26  <DataWraith> ikaros: But it even fails parsing the commandline-flag needed to enable it...
2011-11-05T14:13:37  <ikaros> yea i recognized that
2011-11-05T14:13:48  <ikaros> wanted to hardcode it for now just to test
2011-11-05T14:14:02  <DataWraith> I did the following:
2011-11-05T14:14:02  <ikaros> but i didnt get that function parameter and where i need to create the image
2011-11-05T14:14:17  <DataWraith> var imageOutPrefix string
2011-11-05T14:14:18  <DataWraith> func init() { flag.StringVar(&imageOutPrefix, "imgprefix", "", "image prefix") flag.Parse()
2011-11-05T14:14:39  <DataWraith> } That correctly parses the commandline option.
2011-11-05T14:14:58  <ikaros> as replacement in the function?
2011-11-05T14:15:30  <DataWraith> Basically this code binds the command-line flag "./MyBot --imgprefix=foo" to the imageOutPrefix variable.
2011-11-05T14:15:43  <DataWraith> After that the function sort-of works if you call it in DoTurn()
2011-11-05T14:15:46  <ikaros> so i call this in main?
2011-11-05T14:15:52  <ikaros> ok
2011-11-05T14:16:03  <ikaros> ill just try it
2011-11-05T14:16:11  <DataWraith> I think you had to change one declaration from Color to NRGBAColor too, but after that it kind-of works.
2011-11-05T14:16:26  <ikaros> do you call init() in main once?
2011-11-05T14:16:34  <foRei> How should I go about writing C:\Users\MuTa\Google AITest.exe in play_one_game.cmd? It fucks up with "space" in Google AITest.exe
2011-11-05T14:16:34  <DataWraith> No, init is called automatically by go.
2011-11-05T14:16:39  <ikaros> oh
2011-11-05T14:16:44  <ikaros> good to know :)

2011-11-05T14:23:21  <ikaros> hm something is still wrong here

2011-11-05T14:50:00  <ikaros> DataWraith, try this: http://pastebin.com/Zy6rExZT
2011-11-05T14:50:35  <DataWraith> sec
2011-11-05T14:51:35  <foRei> I was just reading the C# "GetDirections" which I thought was a BFS that I could use to move my ants around, this is what it looks like: http://pastebin.com/KXpnRJrX
2011-11-05T14:51:42  <foRei> Seems very..... useless to me
2011-11-05T14:52:06  <DataWraith> ikaros: Cool, that does it.
2011-11-05T14:52:19  <DataWraith> I thought that was for making every square four tiles in width.
2011-11-05T14:52:55  <foRei> It says it's suppose to return the directions from loc1 to loc2, maybe I misunderstand
2011-11-05T14:53:37  <DataWraith> foRei: It seems to just calculate the distance, not actually find a path
2011-11-05T14:53:57  <ikaros> since the function just returned a color . i think it kinda scaled .. also y,x were exchanged what turned the map
2011-11-05T14:54:04  <DataWraith> foRei: So the ant using that would run into a wall.
2011-11-05T14:54:09  <ikaros> in combination with having it exchanged in the pixel func
2011-11-05T14:54:33  <DataWraith> ikaros: I think y,x is correct, because the map is indexed by rows first an then cols.
2011-11-05T14:55:00  <foRei> If it just wants to calculate the distance, then whats the point of saving directions instead of just increasing an variable >.<
2011-11-05T14:55:00  <ikaros> no because it is exchanged in pixel(..) again
2011-11-05T14:55:07  <ikaros> (i think)
2011-11-05T14:55:11  <foRei> I suppose it works in big open areas with no  water/walls
2011-11-05T14:55:27  <DataWraith> foRei: Yup.
2011-11-05T14:55:34  <DataWraith> ikaros: Hmkay.
2011-11-05T14:55:49  <DataWraith> ikaros: I'll look into it some more once I get this #@!$& A* working...
2011-11-05T14:55:56  <ikaros> sorry
2011-11-05T14:55:59  <ikaros> not the pixel function
2011-11-05T14:56:03  <ikaros> but the imagehelper.at

2011-11-05T14:56:30  <DataWraith> ikaros: Just a first step on the way towards D* Light. :P
2011-11-05T14:56:30  <ikaros> think about just dropping it in favour of bfs :)
2011-11-05T14:56:36  <ikaros> oh ok
2011-11-05T14:56:41  <ikaros> have alot of fun :)
2011-11-05T14:56:46  <DataWraith> thanks. ^^
2011-11-05T14:57:16  <foRei> D* light better than A*?
2011-11-05T14:57:23  <ikaros> im trying to understand go further.. so i can finally try my new ideas
2011-11-05T14:57:46  <DataWraith> foRei: Yeah, it reuses previous searches to speed up searching.
2011-11-05T14:58:00  <foRei> Im trying to google it but no luck, where can I read about it?

2011-11-05T14:59:16  <DataWraith> :)
2011-11-05T15:01:29  <foRei> ah right, cus A* wouldn't be good in ants, cus u dont have full view of the map from the beginning, but D* can path while running when exploring new obstacles cool :D
2011-11-05T15:03:34  <DataWraith> Actually, A* can too, using the Free Space Assumption, it's just a lot less efficient.
2011-11-05T15:05:12  <foRei> I really need my debugger in visual studio to work, if im going to implement this >.< Is there any way to make it work when running ant ai locally?
2011-11-05T15:06:04  <DataWraith> I think someone talked about that before, but I don't remember anything about it.
2011-11-05T15:06:39  <caution> what's the fastest path finding algo even if it doesn't find the shortest path?

2011-11-05T15:07:28  <foRei> I think a simple BFS will be the fastest, since it doesnt search the same node twice
2011-11-05T15:07:37  <DataWraith> foRei: Neither does A*
2011-11-05T15:07:50  <foRei> true, but it can make bad moves because of heuristics
2011-11-05T15:08:00  <DataWraith> Well, not if the heuristic is admissable.
2011-11-05T15:08:16  <foRei> so it may end up finding the path last, if the map is designed in a certain way :D
2011-11-05T15:08:19  <DataWraith> A* is pretty much the fastest algorithm (for a single search!) if you have an admissable heuristic.
2011-11-05T15:08:28  <foRei> true
2011-11-05T15:08:51  <caution> what's an example of an admissable heuristic?
2011-11-05T15:09:16  <DataWraith> Admissable means optimistic. An optimistic heuristic *never* overestimates the distance to the goal.
2011-11-05T15:09:17  <emilk> manhattan distance

2011-11-05T15:09:44  <DataWraith> Because if you overestimate the distance, A* is not guaranteed to find the optimal path (I think)
2011-11-05T15:09:48  <emilk> making the A* pesimistic/non-admissible may speed it up a lot at the sacrifice of accuracy
2011-11-05T15:09:54  <DataWraith> Yup.
2011-11-05T15:10:11  <emilk> wikipedia has a pretty good disussion on the subject
2011-11-05T15:10:19  <DataWraith> There is a variant of A* that uses a parameter to scale the heuristic.
2011-11-05T15:10:46  <DataWraith> First searches with a inadmissable heuristic to find *any* path at all, and then again with more and more admissable heuristics to find a better path.
2011-11-05T15:10:56  <DataWraith> It's all a trade-off of speed vs accuracy.

2011-11-05T15:11:25  <DataWraith> Which are slower for a single search, but faster for multiple ones.

2011-11-05T16:14:03  <mcstar> the most effective way
2011-11-05T16:14:16  <Antimony> It may be NP Complete, but there are many cases that can be solved efficiently
2011-11-05T16:14:18  <janzert> wasili: a team of three or any size is fine, just be sure to only use one account for the whole team
2011-11-05T16:14:30  <Antimony> for example, graphs with bounded branchwidth can be solved in polynomial time
2011-11-05T16:14:35  <DataWraith> True, but it does tend to get much more difficult with problem size
2011-11-05T16:14:42  <Antimony> and PAcman mazes often have a small branchwidth
2011-11-05T16:14:44  <mcstar> perfect matching in sort of n^3
2011-11-05T16:14:45  <wasili> okay, thank you very much janzert
2011-11-05T16:14:46  <janzert> AnJoMa: yes and the command is erl -hms"+ str(MEMORY_LIMIT) +"m -smp disable -noshell -s my_bot start -s init stop
2011-11-05T16:14:52  <mcstar> and you dont need better
2011-11-05T16:14:57  <mcstar> since everything is too dynamic
2011-11-05T16:15:08  <Antimony> So in most cases, Pacman can be exactly solved
2011-11-05T16:15:19  <janzert> where the MEMORY_LIMIT part is replaced of course with the actual limit in megabytes
2011-11-05T16:15:30  <mcstar> Antimony: you can iterate perfect matching
2011-11-05T16:15:34  <janzert> which is 1.5GB on the server
2011-11-05T16:15:58  <Antimony> I'm talking about the problem of finding the shortest path visting every food
2011-11-05T16:16:03  <Antimony> it's exponential in teh general case
2011-11-05T16:16:12  <mcstar> but you dont have 1 ant usually
2011-11-05T16:16:16  <Antimony> I know
2011-11-05T16:16:20  <Antimony> but someone asked about Pacman
2011-11-05T16:16:27  <Antimony> it's not applicable to Ants
2011-11-05T16:16:43  <mcstar> yep, but the environment is changing soo dynamically, that you are better off re-solving perfect matching as you go

2011-11-05T16:18:32  <mcstar> well, if you knew the whole map and food wouldnt spawn after the start, traveling salesman would make perfect sense :D
2011-11-05T16:18:45  <Antimony> and if there were no enemies and only a single ant
2011-11-05T16:19:01  <Antimony> and you had to walk onto food
2011-11-05T16:19:19  <Antimony> and it's not technically TSP anyway, it's a variation

2011-11-05T16:19:31  <Antimony> standard TSP is a cycle and forbids repeated visits
2011-11-05T16:20:43  <mcstar> what? salesman got to get home?
2011-11-05T16:21:01  <Antimony> in the standard rpoblem, yes
2011-11-05T16:21:18  <Antimony> it makes things much simpler coding wise
2011-11-05T16:21:18  <mcstar> i would rather garbage collect my salesman
2011-11-05T16:21:26  <Antimony> but it doesn't affect the compelxity much

2011-11-05T16:26:41  <amanforindia> how do i get a good heuristic for travelling salesman with A*
2011-11-05T16:26:51  <Antimony> you don't
2011-11-05T16:27:02  <Antimony> use branch decomposition and dynamic programming

2011-11-05T16:31:47  <AnJoMa> janzert: Thanks. it works now :D
2011-11-05T16:32:19  <foRei> amanforindia if you dont have more than 10 targets then im sure my solution will work just fine.. A* with manhattan distance (1) as heuristic to get the weight between each node and simply bruteforce tsp to find the order in which you move to the targets... Thats how I'd do it :)
2011-11-05T16:32:36  <foRei> But as I said, Im sure there are more elegant ways of solving it
2011-11-05T16:32:45  <Antimony> dynamic programmign is better than bruteforce
2011-11-05T16:33:05  <Antimony> but for large graphs, it's still too slow wihtout decomposition
2011-11-05T16:33:50  <mcstar> i still dont get why people are pushing this

2011-11-05T16:53:33  <mcstar> i found a nice game
2011-11-05T16:53:45  <mcstar> try to find your country by its code
2011-11-05T16:53:50  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-05T16:54:04  <conor_f> as in go through every country until you find your one? :P
2011-11-05T16:54:05  <mcstar> i reached cambodia
2011-11-05T16:54:14  <conor_f> that's just stupid lol
2011-11-05T16:54:42  <mcstar> i thought i remembered 120, but its 108
2011-11-05T16:54:42  <caution> why are all your opponents going straight up?
2011-11-05T16:54:46  <mcstar> 106
2011-11-05T16:54:58  <conor_f> caution: because they must be really stupid :P
2011-11-05T16:55:11  <caution> all of them using the same bot though
2011-11-05T16:55:29  <conor_f> must be one of the example bots
2011-11-05T16:56:03  <caution> cool  Ireland
2011-11-05T16:56:09  <conor_f> ? :P
2011-11-05T16:56:14  <conor_f> only 20 people lol
2011-11-05T16:56:17  <caution> if I joined Ireland I'd be 3rd haha
2011-11-05T16:56:44  <conor_f> :P I want to get in the top 5 in .ie :)
2011-11-05T16:56:46  <DataWraith> I dunno. Emigration seems like a lot of hassle just for improving one's rank... :P
2011-11-05T16:56:47  <conor_f> my goal lol
2011-11-05T16:57:03  <mcstar> hm, faking citizenship?
2011-11-05T16:58:15  <DataWraith> ^^
2011-11-05T16:58:29  <Minthos> or you could just write the bot in D: http://aichallenge.org/language_profile.php?language=D
2011-11-05T16:58:42  <caution> my bot doesn't even have pathfinding conor
2011-11-05T16:58:43  <Minthos> not much competition on that list
2011-11-05T16:58:46  <caution> you'll easily get top 3
2011-11-05T16:59:01  <conor_f> caution: hopefully :) I'm not the best coder though :/
2011-11-05T16:59:29  <caution> looks like you just need to make the ants target different foods instead of all the same
2011-11-05T16:59:33  <conor_f> wait, how'd you get so high with no pathfinding?!?
2011-11-05T16:59:48  <caution> I'm top 1000, wouldn't call that high
2011-11-05T16:59:58  <conor_f> pretty good
2011-11-05T17:00:36  <caution> ants spasming around randomly is enough apparently
2011-11-05T17:00:45  <conor_f> I'd be happy enough with top 1000

2011-11-05T17:11:13  <conor_f> I thought you could with a for loop.
2011-11-05T17:11:13  <jbroman> The comma is actually an operator; it doesn't create separate statements as the semicolon does.
2011-11-05T17:11:14  <conor_f> ok
2011-11-05T17:11:17  <g0llum> conor_f, the thing behind the comma has to of the same type as the first

2011-11-05T17:11:37  <conor_f> but that doesn't. gotcha
2011-11-05T17:11:40  <jbroman> If you put "int j;" beforehand, it should be fine (assuming food_objectives_iter) is defined.

2011-11-05T17:16:50  <Loesje> Question: I've submitted my bot and it played one game. Now for the second game, I have to wait more then two hours still.

2011-11-05T17:17:21  <Loesje> But the bot that I have fighted against, has now already done four games after the game against my bot?
2011-11-05T17:17:22  <conor_f> ants.fluxid.pl iirc
2011-11-05T17:17:34  <conor_f> Loesje: yeah, it's a mess of a system :P
2011-11-05T17:17:52  <Loesje> conor_f, so that's normal?
2011-11-05T17:18:01  <conor_f> yup
2011-11-05T17:18:07  <conor_f> I waited a day without playing a game
2011-11-05T17:18:24  <Loesje> I won that fight, but that other both has a much higher ranking than mine, now. ;(
2011-11-05T17:18:25  <a1k0n> your opponent was randomly picked for other games, no doubt
2011-11-05T17:18:58  <DataWraith> Loesje: The players take turns; some bots get a lot of games because they get chosen as opponents often. That's a property of the ranking algorithm.
2011-11-05T17:19:11  <Minthos> Loesje: your bot will get its deserved rank within a few days
2011-11-05T17:19:19  <a1k0n> it took something like 5 days from submission for my rank to stabilize
2011-11-05T17:19:26  <g0llum> my current favorite typo: for i,food in m.cows { ... wait, that was m.rols, wtf ;)
2011-11-05T17:19:31  <Loesje> So when are you chosen as opponent?
2011-11-05T17:19:52  <Minthos> when others need bots to fill a game
2011-11-05T17:19:54  <DataWraith> Loesje: TrueSkill tries to match a bot against equally strong opponents.
2011-11-05T17:20:05  <a1k0n> which means you're going to beat up on a few more starter bots
2011-11-05T17:20:29  <DataWraith> Loesje: And if your bot has a certain strength, and the algorithm is fairly sure that it has that strength, it tends to get chosen often as opponent for bots with similar strength.
2011-11-05T17:20:32  <Loesje> And all the starter-bots have a lot of games, because there are many others on that level?
2011-11-05T17:20:54  <DataWraith> That plays a role too.
2011-11-05T17:21:17  <DataWraith> Basically the algorithm tries to maximize the information it can gain from the outcome of a match.
2011-11-05T17:21:41  <DataWraith> That means that bots with low uncertainty in their skill, somewhat close to the skill of the bot that starts the game are chosen.
2011-11-05T17:21:42  <Loesje> So now I have to wait. Too bad, I hoped that submitting would show me some weak point that I could work on tonight. Now I have nothing to do.
2011-11-05T17:21:52  <DataWraith> There's a TCP server.
2011-11-05T17:22:24  <Loesje> TCP server? (Are there servers on the net that does not use TCP?)
2011-11-05T17:22:31  <Loesje> (Yes there are, I know...)
2011-11-05T17:22:36  <mcstar> lol
2011-11-05T17:22:44  <jbroman> Loesje: The games are played over TCP, as opposed to locally over a pipe.
2011-11-05T17:22:47  <DataWraith> There's a server were you can play your bot against other people also connecting to that.
2011-11-05T17:22:56  <DataWraith> Instead of waiting for the official servers.
2011-11-05T17:23:07  <jbroman> (This is unofficial, and runs the bot on your computer, but can't be used for ranking because it isn't completely fair.)

2011-11-05T17:27:58  <a1k0n> well, there's the rub and thats what i'm asking about :)
2011-11-05T17:28:09  <mcstar> ok, what do you mean by combat area?
2011-11-05T17:28:21  <mcstar> my test case is 2 vs 1 ant
2011-11-05T17:29:05  <mcstar> and i can generate 2 turn possible futures in less than 6 ms
2011-11-05T17:29:21  <mcstar> its 2ms rather
2011-11-05T17:29:30  <mcstar> interpolating from a larger run
2011-11-05T17:29:32  <a1k0n> well, the ants within the, let's call it "light cone", of the time horizon you're searching over
2011-11-05T17:29:38  <jix> aren't larger battles more realistic?
2011-11-05T17:30:07  <mcstar> a1k0n: well, there are 3 ants involved
2011-11-05T17:30:12  <a1k0n> yeah in that case nevermind
2011-11-05T17:30:16  <mcstar> so its a very limited region
2011-11-05T17:30:24  <mcstar> ant light doesnt travel far in 2 turns
2011-11-05T17:31:00  <a1k0n> yeah, you just have to consider peripheral ants that could enter combat in the general case
2011-11-05T17:31:19  <mcstar> i just told you this, because i remember you said something yesterday along the lines that recursive generation is not feasible?
2011-11-05T17:31:26  <mcstar> i could have misunderstood you
2011-11-05T17:31:34  <a1k0n> definitely infeasible in general.
2011-11-05T17:31:53  <a1k0n> i'm just.. considering the ideal case before optimizing it away :)
2011-11-05T17:31:58  <mcstar> but while the tree is shallow....
2011-11-05T17:32:13  <mcstar> its a depth-first search
2011-11-05T17:32:19  <mcstar> so the stack isnt that big
2011-11-05T17:32:39  <mcstar> i mean technologically its not a problem

2011-11-05T18:19:53  <avdg> conor_f: try to add debug messages between the crash, so you can locate it
2011-11-05T18:20:12  <avdg> and later why
2011-11-05T18:20:16  <conor_f> Zao: true, seems excessive though :/
2011-11-05T18:20:17  <mcstar> Demox: probably you cant
2011-11-05T18:20:32  <Zao> conor_f: You're crashing. Crashes are easiest to handle through a debugger.
2011-11-05T18:20:39  <Zao> conor_f: Or make it dump core and post-mortem debug.
2011-11-05T18:20:52  <Zao> printf-debugging is a very poor substitute.
2011-11-05T18:20:53  <conor_f> avdg: yeah, I have isolated it. something happens between the turn end (which is ok) and the next turn's start
2011-11-05T18:21:05  <conor_f> as in gdb? :/
2011-11-05T18:21:12  <Demox> Oh, k thx mcstar
2011-11-05T18:21:14  <conor_f> I hate that
2011-11-05T18:21:29  <mcstar> Demox: talk to amstan or janzert
2011-11-05T18:22:26  <conor_f> wtf, I've two scripts, game.sh and tutorial.sh
2011-11-05T18:22:40  <conor_f> crashes in tutorial.sh, runs in game.sh....
2011-11-05T18:23:33  <conor_f> granted it dies naturally straight away
2011-11-05T18:23:35  <conor_f> but still
2011-11-05T18:25:35  <bergmark> Is the name/password for fluxid the same as aichallenge.org?
2011-11-05T18:25:41  <conor_f> o

2011-11-05T18:25:42  <DataWraith> bergmark: no

2011-11-05T18:26:20  <bergmark> DataWraith: I see, thank you
2011-11-05T18:26:28  <DataWraith> bergmark: You're welcome
2011-11-05T18:27:08  <jix> how does matching on the tcp server work?
2011-11-05T18:29:38  <g0llum> jix, no matching there, simple fifo

2011-11-05T18:47:27  <Esak> which programming languages do you use?
2011-11-05T18:47:38  <mcstar> hard to say
2011-11-05T18:47:44  <Esak> ?
2011-11-05T18:47:50  <mcstar> i just switched
2011-11-05T18:47:54  <conor_f> one that's just an increment better then all the rest :P
2011-11-05T18:47:58  <conor_f> *for me
2011-11-05T18:48:27  <mcstar> i switched to a worse language actually
2011-11-05T18:48:33  <mcstar> for practical reasons
2011-11-05T18:48:35  <conor_f> you changed again?
2011-11-05T18:48:42  <mcstar> no, only once
2011-11-05T18:48:52  <Esak> which language?
2011-11-05T18:49:00  <mcstar> from common lisp to c++
2011-11-05T18:49:48  <jix> ouch
2011-11-05T18:49:50  <Minthos> Esak: I'm a professional, but I'm just doing this for fun
2011-11-05T18:50:04  <Esak> is a 'low level' language really necessary or is a interpreter like php also fine?
2011-11-05T18:50:11  <Esak> ah ok :)
2011-11-05T18:50:51  <mcstar> i bet there is php for the jvm :D
2011-11-05T18:50:52  <Esak> I am a web developer so the low level languages are pretty hard to use for me :(
2011-11-05T18:51:30  <Esak> I meant more for the speed
2011-11-05T18:52:04  <mcstar> it could be faster than a php to c compiler
2011-11-05T18:52:07  <mcstar> or i dont know
2011-11-05T18:52:07  <Minthos> for some things I think you want at least half-decent performance
2011-11-05T18:52:13  <mcstar> i mean im not familiar with php
2011-11-05T18:52:28  <Minthos> pathfinding and combat specifically
2011-11-05T18:52:43  <Esak> true
2011-11-05T18:53:02  <Esak> multiple languages is not allowed/possible right?

2011-11-05T19:20:31  <Fluxid> exactly the same as in visualizer at the end of game
2011-11-05T19:20:32  <conor_f> that'd explain all my zeros then ;)

2011-11-05T19:21:41  <conor_f> I dunno what's wrong with my bot, thought I got it working but I didn't :/

2011-11-05T19:22:11  <mcstar> but i didnt see their teachers come back
2011-11-05T19:22:46  <foRei> ow
2011-11-05T19:23:30  <a1k0n> foRei: i think it's a good approach (though i'd learn the value function instead of the Q function, since the transition is pretty trivial)

2011-11-05T19:29:22  <foRei> shouldn't take long to implement reinforcement learning, not too complicated

2011-11-05T20:04:27  <janzert> the only way any of radii will change at this point is if we find a major problem with the current settings, which should be pretty unlikely by now

2011-11-05T20:10:19  <janzert> I just manually tweaked the limits to generate the maps for the start of the competition
2011-11-05T20:10:27  <Ellos_> i do have this question about the viewradius2 is the sqrt of the radius truncated or rounded? because there is no such thing as half a tile of vision right?
2011-11-05T20:11:03  <janzert> Ellos_: if the tile distance is < the radius it is in range
2011-11-05T20:11:22  <janzert> distance is the euclidean distance
2011-11-05T20:12:46  <Ellos_> janzert: ehm so that means it is truncated then..
2011-11-05T20:13:58  <danielharan> it's an arbitrary number. not sure how truncated is relevant
2011-11-05T20:15:05  <janzert> and actually it is <=
2011-11-05T20:15:30  <janzert> I suppose truncating it would give the same result as far as I can think of offhand
2011-11-05T20:15:40  <Ellos_> yeah thats what i meant
2011-11-05T20:15:46  <janzert> but neither is done :}
2011-11-05T20:15:56  <Ellos_> you go from double precision to an int
2011-11-05T20:16:10  <janzert> actually pretty sure radius^2 is just used everywhere
2011-11-05T20:16:17  <janzert> saves doing a sqrt anywhere
2011-11-05T20:16:53  <Ellos_> yeah but using it in my code to ease the calculation of my prio map
2011-11-05T20:17:50  <Ellos_> a sort of collaborative diffusion but a bit more advanced than how most people implement it
2011-11-05T20:18:20  <Ellos_> still have to find out if it is going to do magic or be around the same as a standard CD alg.

2011-11-05T20:40:03  <McLeopold> I think random might be too
2011-11-05T20:40:07  <amstan> McLeopold: heightmap was just infinite looping last time i tried it
2011-11-05T20:40:26  * janzert nods
2011-11-05T20:40:54  <McLeopold> amstan: look at random_map.py
2011-11-05T20:40:56  <caution> how likely are the settings like attackradius to change?
2011-11-05T20:41:05  <amstan> i'm making my own because I failed at adding stuff to mapgen.py, it seemed like the symmetry was too intermingled with the maze logic
2011-11-05T20:41:10  <McLeopold> caution: very, very unlikely
2011-11-05T20:41:19  <janzert> caution: we hope not to change them and would only do so if a problem arose
2011-11-05T20:42:25  <amstan> McLeopold: do you know how the translational symmetry works?
2011-11-05T20:42:32  <McLeopold> in theory
2011-11-05T20:43:23  <McLeopold> amstan: about the foums :), let get them split, see the etherpad link
2011-11-05T20:43:33  <caution> I notice in the visualiser, up two, left or right one square, doesn't always show the attackradius circle. Is this accurate or a display error?

2011-11-05T20:51:54  <foRei> Set a break point and see the values of all data while the code is running, slowly stepping forward to trace the code and find the error
2011-11-05T20:52:32  <cbad> yes you can do that in visual studio. youu'll need to manually attach to your running process if you are using the scripts to start your game
2011-11-05T20:52:52  <cbad> debug -> attach to process....
2011-11-05T20:53:44  <amstan> McLeopold: the more i think about it the more we should be using the forums instead of the mailing list
2011-11-05T20:53:53  <McLeopold> I agree
2011-11-05T20:54:05  <amstan> so i'll keep that
2011-11-05T20:54:06  <foRei> I don't see "attach to process", it's suppose to be under "Debug" in the Visual C# (File, Edit, View, etc) ?

2011-11-05T21:26:58  <amstan> and then you calculate deltax and deltay for between players?
2011-11-05T21:27:58  <antimatroid> basically you define translate(loc) := ((loc.row + row_translate)%rows, (loc.col + col_translate)%cols)m then pick n = no_players, rows, cols, row_translate and col_translate such that translate^n(x) = x for all locations x

2011-11-05T21:56:11  <swinejihad> there are simpler alternatives but if you insisted on going that way you'd have to be able to figure out whether a tile is seen or unseen
2011-11-05T21:56:19  <swinejihad> then apply it to every tile on the map
2011-11-05T21:56:38  <swinejihad> unless you did something like approximated

2011-11-05T22:42:39  <janzert> less of the map will probably end up being important in general but I can't really think of a big problem offhand

2011-11-05T22:43:12  <janzert> except with more players you're likely to end up with staggered back and forth allignments

2011-11-05T22:46:33  <janzert> it splits the players into odds and evens
2011-11-05T22:46:46  <hjax> janzert: exactly
2011-11-05T22:46:51  <janzert> but yeah, if it needs to be fixed just pick the factors the way it is done in symmetric_mapgen now

2011-11-05T22:54:28  <bobbydroptable> hjax: i 've spent > 2 weeks every day just thinking/staring at code/writing stuff down.
2011-11-05T22:54:37  <hjax> although im 4 hours at least into my bot and it cannot even gather food
2011-11-05T22:54:38  <bobbydroptable> i haven't done any paying work at all during that time
2011-11-05T22:54:43  <bobbydroptable> which is kind of a worry...
2011-11-05T22:55:10  <amstan_> hmm
2011-11-05T22:55:16  <amstan_> how should i organize these filling methods
2011-11-05T22:55:20  <amstan_> should i keep them in classes?
2011-11-05T22:55:56  <bobbydroptable> in a way, this challenge scratches several itches: learn AI stuffs, learn a new language, and do something interesting and productive
2011-11-05T22:55:57  <janzert> that's probably what I would do but I guess it depends on how the rest of the code works
2011-11-05T22:56:02  <hjax> my bot is garbage, mostly because I don't apply any ai concepts, I just write it to play the game, plus I'm bad at python
2011-11-05T22:56:06  <janzert> I assume they're more than a simple function
2011-11-05T22:56:38  <amstan_> janzert: so far i nested the classes: symmetricmap(symmetry) inherets map(players) inherets terrain(land vs water)
2011-11-05T22:56:41  <bobbydroptable> well once you realise that you don't apply any AI concepts you'll eventually research some
2011-11-05T22:56:59  <bobbydroptable> and then you realised that you probably accidentally implemented 1 or 2 AI related stuff
2011-11-05T22:57:25  <hjax> idk how things like minimax work, and the first thing I am putting in is BFS
2011-11-05T22:57:38  <amstan_> janzert: i guess i could just make all the filling methods inheret from symmetricmap, since there's not much point to inheret just map
2011-11-05T22:57:53  <Extrarius> bobbydroptable: This is definitely the best AI challenge I've ever seen - most of them are either way too simple or way too complicated, whereas the ants thing seems to be just enough to make the game itself interesting while still also having room for any amount of AI you want to apply
2011-11-05T22:58:02  <janzert> amstan_: hmm... I don't particularly like deep inheritance chains myself
2011-11-05T22:58:12  <janzert> but I'm not writing it so go for the style you like :)
2011-11-05T22:58:35  <bobbydroptable> BFS is a fundamental algorithm in AI.
2011-11-05T22:58:40  <amstan_> janzert: i wrote it like that because it was easy to test
2011-11-05T22:58:46  <hjax> bobbydroptable: my bot can't even explore or gather food yet....
2011-11-05T22:59:23  <hjax> bobby: I know, I need it for pathfinding, I actually reinvented it and had someone tell me it already exists
2011-11-05T22:59:31  <janzert> instead of the fill class inheriting from the map class can it just be given a map to fill?
2011-11-05T22:59:52  <bobbydroptable> yeh
2011-11-05T23:00:04  <janzert> I'm not really sure the fill class API looks like though
2011-11-05T23:00:08  <bobbydroptable> so in a way you're probably just treading a path others have already passed through
2011-11-05T23:00:12  <amstan_> janzert: it's not made yet
2011-11-05T23:00:32  <hjax> but I haven't started coding it yet, I can't even implement a good queue (the one I'm writing ATM is soooo slow)
2011-11-05T23:00:39  <Extrarius> yeah, with classes, the important question is which makes more sense: "A is a B", "A has a B", or "A has many Bs"
2011-11-05T23:00:41  <janzert> yeah, I meant more what it should like/ what role it is exactly filling

2011-11-05T23:01:16  <amstan_> janzert: my goal is to do print CaveMap(size=Point(10,10),players=2,"horizontal_reflection") and recieve a map
2011-11-05T23:01:42  <amstan_> but no.. there's other things that have to go in, sigh
2011-11-05T23:02:26  <Extrarius> it'd be neat to have hybrid maps, eg maze-like bases with random walk fields between bases or somesuch
2011-11-05T23:02:44  <hjax> bobbydroptable: my queue deals with manipulating long strings and holding them in a list, in python = slow

2011-11-05T23:06:03  <hjax> all packed into one string
2011-11-05T23:06:09  <Extrarius> why not store them in lists?
2011-11-05T23:06:49  <bobbydroptable> yeh putting them all into 1 string doesn't provide much benefit
2011-11-05T23:06:51  <hjax> because I thought nesting lists in lists would be slower
2011-11-05T23:06:58  <bobbydroptable> in fact it probably increases memory usage

2011-11-05T23:12:37  <bobbydroptable> if it has been explored, and there is a water tile, it says no
2011-11-05T23:13:15  <Extrarius> note that ants.passable() isn't enough to know you can move somewhere - you can't move on top of food (eg if it spawns in front of you) but passable will return true

2011-11-05T23:14:57  <hjax> suicide is also not prevented by passable
2011-11-05T23:15:12  <bobbydroptable> Extrarius but if food spawns next to you, it will get collected anyway so i don't understand that assertion
2011-11-05T23:15:56  <Extrarius> bobbydroptable: It will get collected during the next turn, but if you try to move over it, the move will fail, so you'll be in the same spot as last turn
2011-11-05T23:16:25  <Extrarius> if you're keeping track of your ants by location and updating location after each order, you'll lose track of your ants if you don't take that into account
