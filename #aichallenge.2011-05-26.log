2011-05-26T01:20:26  <Frontier> @later tell amstan: The worker enters an endless loop if you commit source code in a language the compiler.py understands, but is not in the database.

2011-05-26T06:51:34  <antimatroid1> do they see dead enemy ants?
2011-05-26T06:51:43  <antimatroid1> i kind of liked that you cut out people's vision of what happened
2011-05-26T06:51:47  <antimatroid1> so there wasn't as much information
2011-05-26T06:51:59  <sigh> no, just reports your own dead ants

2011-05-26T11:31:51  <demerzel> no i didn'tk now we had noe
2011-05-26T11:32:00  <smiley1983> they want them all the same this time
2011-05-26T11:32:03  <demerzel> the cpp one just hits a wall north and stops
2011-05-26T11:32:04  <demerzel> lol
2011-05-26T11:32:17  <demerzel> ah do you have a link?
2011-05-26T11:32:26  <smiley1983> starter bots try N, E, S and W in that order, barring water
2011-05-26T11:32:46  <smiley1983> getting link...
2011-05-26T11:33:02  <smiley1983> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Starter-Pack-Guide
2011-05-26T11:34:23  <demerzel> oh woops my bot is too advanced
2011-05-26T11:34:34  <demerzel> does heuristic valuation of nodes based on things in radius + collision detection
2011-05-26T11:35:09  <demerzel> you wouldn't guess that looking at it haha
2011-05-26T11:35:14  <demerzel> it's juts got really shitty weights
2011-05-26T11:35:22  <smiley1983> yes, I think they want such things released separately as tools
2011-05-26T11:35:50  <demerzel> eh i made oen specifically to be a starter bot i can do that to it i guess ty
2011-05-26T11:36:54  <smiley1983> np. Do you know the command to make a contest server run games?
2011-05-26T11:38:27  <demerzel> i thought it was a loop of worker -t but idk honestly
2011-05-26T11:38:38  <demerzel> via manager
2011-05-26T11:39:25  <smiley1983> I'm running worker -t directly, I'll see what I can do with manager...
2011-05-26T11:39:40  <demerzel> amstan i'm sure you can answer that in 10 seconds
2011-05-26T11:39:48  <demerzel> i don't admin the server just pay for it lol
2011-05-26T11:39:54  <amstan> ?
2011-05-26T11:40:04  <demerzel> what does he run to actually have games go automatically
2011-05-26T11:40:11  <demerzel> is it manager?
2011-05-26T11:40:16  <amstan> no
2011-05-26T11:40:20  <amstan> but why does he have a server?
2011-05-26T11:40:27  <demerzel> idk i assume he just cloned repo
2011-05-26T11:40:30  <smiley1983> virtual machine
2011-05-26T11:40:35  <smiley1983> is that allowed?
2011-05-26T11:40:35  <amstan> smiley1983: you really want a server?
2011-05-26T11:40:48  <demerzel> easier than writing your own i guess lol
2011-05-26T11:40:48  <smiley1983> much easier than doing all my testing manually
2011-05-26T11:40:53  <amstan> smiley1983: what are you trying to do?
2011-05-26T11:40:58  <amstan> smiley1983: just run games?
2011-05-26T11:41:06  <smiley1983> yes, and update rankings
2011-05-26T11:41:13  <amstan> hmm, i guess you could do that
2011-05-26T11:41:30  <amstan> smiley1983: follow install.md
2011-05-26T11:41:41  <amstan> and i think it's missing the part where you need to add maps
2011-05-26T11:42:00  <amstan> and then you have to tun ./worker.py -t -n 0 for continous processing
2011-05-26T11:42:08  <amstan> run*
2011-05-26T11:42:11  <smiley1983> ah, great, thankyou
2011-05-26T11:42:20  <smiley1983> It's possibly I missed the maps step on this install
2011-05-26T11:42:25  <amstan> it's a long process, i can't explain it right now
2011-05-26T11:42:33  <amstan> smiley1983: if it's just getting no tasks, that's the problem
2011-05-26T11:42:39  <smiley1983> Just to confirm: this is allowed, right?
2011-05-26T11:42:43  <amstan> smiley1983: of course
2011-05-26T11:42:51  <smiley1983> Great, thankyou for your help
2011-05-26T11:43:10  <amstan> we just had some other ppl trying to test their bots using the worker, and that's not what you need to do to do a simple test
2011-05-26T11:43:23  <amstan> but if you want to be comparing bots, and benchmarking, i guess this is good
2011-05-26T11:43:38  <smiley1983> I was thinking of writing the scripts to automate the testing and put the results into some sort of parseable format, and then I realised that you have all the framework for that and more...

2011-05-26T16:15:19  <Frontier> There still seems to be a bug where the life span of an ant is wrong. I had 2 replays with that error yesterday.

2011-05-26T16:15:48  <McLeopold> we need to let sigh know

2011-05-26T16:16:56  <McLeopold> Yeah, I got that one fixed too
2011-05-26T16:17:17  <Frontier> McLeopold: I'm not motivated, but give it a shot.
2011-05-26T16:18:21  <McLeopold> Can the front page only display the map, play slowly, then if you click anywhere go to the visualizer page?

2011-05-26T16:19:38  <Frontier> Oh and the ranking page looked weird yesterday, but I don't need to tell anyone. It was very obvious :p
2011-05-26T16:19:47  <McLeopold> I'm working on rankings
2011-05-26T16:20:16  <McLeopold> So, display the game # and players, and keep those clickable, just not the graph
2011-05-26T16:20:20  <McLeopold> keep the speed
2011-05-26T16:20:42  <McLeopold> Is it possible to capture a scroll wheel?
2011-05-26T16:21:03  <Frontier> No, you can not capture anything from the browser.
2011-05-26T16:21:19  <Frontier> You always end up with two actions performed

2011-05-26T16:24:43  <McLeopold> Frontier: the point is to give someone a taste of what ants is like, but we are taking up too much room on the index page.
2011-05-26T16:25:12  <McLeopold> Just showing ants moving around is good enough, with a few small clickable areas for those that want full control of the viewer.

2011-05-26T16:32:01  <anonymous111> i think the best strategy is to get some breadcrumbs, put them near some real ants, model their behavior as a swarm
2011-05-26T16:32:20  <anonymous111> your ants seem to dance with eachother Frontier
2011-05-26T16:32:26  <Frontier> you watched a butiful minde once too often :p

2011-05-26T16:33:54  <Frontier> My ants fall into defensive mode when attacked. And sir_macelon's bot gets pretty much paralized by that.

2011-05-26T16:38:08  <Hjax> your bot gets more control over what is happening, instead of sending ships and waiting for the outcome

2011-05-26T19:24:28  <Frontier> There were old submissions in this game, hjax. There is one submission without an existing user and old submissions of existing users
2011-05-26T19:24:51  <bhasker> so question
2011-05-26T19:24:54  <bhasker> how is the rank decided
2011-05-26T19:25:00  <bhasker> i don't understand those skill numbers
2011-05-26T19:25:03  <bhasker> they are all over the place
2011-05-26T19:25:08  <bhasker> and rank and numbers don't seem to correspond
2011-05-26T19:25:17  <McLeopold> I'm working on it, update soon...
2011-05-26T19:25:38  <McLeopold> But, the skill is the TrueSkill, from 0 to 100
2011-05-26T19:25:50  <bhasker> k and rank?
2011-05-26T19:25:52  <hjax> hmmm
2011-05-26T19:26:04  <McLeopold> rank is 1st, 2nd and so on
2011-05-26T19:26:12  <McLeopold> not including old submissions
2011-05-26T19:26:24  <Frontier> McLeopold: If it is 0..100, then make it % ! That would make it easy to understand.
2011-05-26T19:26:39  <McLeopold> but it's not a percentage
2011-05-26T19:26:45  <hjax> why does it say 1 or 7 and give me 10 skill when i loose?
2011-05-26T19:26:54  <hjax> 1 of 7*
2011-05-26T19:26:57  <bhasker> so rank is purely based on wins?
2011-05-26T19:27:02  <McLeopold> 1st of 7 players
2011-05-26T19:27:20  <hjax> 1st place?
2011-05-26T19:27:28  <McLeopold> order the submissions by skill, then number them 1 and count up
2011-05-26T19:27:33  <Frontier> who cares what it technically is. ppl are familiar with values from 0 to 100 being % :) They see a % sign and think, "ah so this goes from 0 to 100"
2011-05-26T19:28:43  <Frontier> or think 100 is the maximum value, so it is 100% of the available range of values

2011-05-26T19:32:44  <demerzel> its weird that it prefers horizontal though because it's just judging tiles on pure weight

2011-05-26T19:34:30  <demerzel> i am sad i didn't save it when it was kicking ass and upload that
2011-05-26T19:34:33  <demerzel> oh yea?
2011-05-26T19:34:43  <hjax> it went back and forth for a long time, then went straight up and made this huge flood of ants
2011-05-26T19:34:50  <demerzel> i am swithcing languages so that was my last upload in C# i don't wanna go back and fix it
2011-05-26T19:35:02  <demerzel> hmm i would look for it but hte server is on fire lol
2011-05-26T19:35:07  <demerzel> ie it's going fast as hell w/ games
2011-05-26T19:35:24  <demerzel> which is good don't get me wrong lol
2011-05-26T19:35:47  <demerzel> that bot is purely judging tile value on weights re: my ants, dead ants, enemy ants, food, water (2 out)
2011-05-26T19:35:59  <demerzel> i musta screwed something up in the last version cuz ti was kicking ass :(
2011-05-26T19:36:27  <hjax> im getting a game every 30 seconds :/
2011-05-26T19:36:28  <Frontier> 10 players -> 5000 palyers... speed /= 500 :p
2011-05-26T19:37:13  <demerzel> i can't beileve it's going 1000 turns by design
2011-05-26T19:37:18  <demerzel> cool but crazy
2011-05-26T19:37:33  <demerzel> i like it re: ai because 100 turns is just best heuristics but 1000 gives some room for real ai
2011-05-26T19:37:36  <demerzel> hope it stays that way
2011-05-26T19:37:54  <Frontier> demerzel lets do the math pls :p
2011-05-26T19:38:01  <demerzel> do what math
2011-05-26T19:38:16  <Frontier> 1000 turns * 5 players * 1 second
2011-05-26T19:38:38  <demerzel> yea but the official servers were never the place to see fast games
2011-05-26T19:38:47  <demerzel> dhartmei's tcp server is where i went when i wanted quick feedback
2011-05-26T19:38:51  <McLeopold> demerzel: how about 10,0000?
2011-05-26T19:38:54  <demerzel> hell galcon was runningl ike once every 4 hours
2011-05-26T19:39:18  <demerzel> McLeopold: i like the longer turns i think they are just wondering how it will scale
2011-05-26T19:39:21  <demerzel> a good question imo
2011-05-26T19:39:33  <Frontier> demerzel, really? if you play 1000 seconds over tcp you consider this fast?
2011-05-26T19:39:47  <demerzel> i had tcp builtin on my bot lol
2011-05-26T19:39:58  <demerzel> like part of the code i just abstracted the parsing didn't care where it got it from
2011-05-26T19:40:11  <demerzel> = instant feedback

2011-05-26T19:40:48  <demerzel> i thought it was that we weren't getting enough games not that 1 game was taking too long
2011-05-26T19:41:13  <Frontier> well, it correlates ;o)
2011-05-26T19:41:31  <demerzel> yes but they are actually 2 different things

2011-05-26T19:41:52  <Frontier> nah, I'm quiet now. For now we are faster than I can replay the games :p
2011-05-26T19:42:50  <demerzel> i need to write my damn bot already i got to the parsing part and got hammered with work so bad i was up till 4am tues working

2011-05-26T19:43:08  <hjax> but they workers have to compile too

2011-05-26T19:43:31  <demerzel> McLeopold: do they actually compile code every game or does it keep an executable?
2011-05-26T19:43:50  <demerzel> if it's not python that is i guess
2011-05-26T19:43:53  <Frontier> demerzel: The executable is cached :)
2011-05-26T19:43:59  <demerzel> oh good
2011-05-26T19:44:10  <demerzel> was like whoa really recompile per game?
2011-05-26T19:44:45  <hjax> i ment compile new submissions

2011-05-26T19:45:39  <bhasker> this is going to be a crazy competition
2011-05-26T19:45:40  <Frontier> Hmm, the games run much longer than a single compile and each successfully compiled entry is worth several games. I doubt the compile time is actually accounting for much.

2011-05-26T19:56:41  <demerzel> why is it euclidian instead of manhattan

2011-05-26T19:58:31  <Frontier> demerzel: I asked that same question when I was in the shower. "Why is there an eucledian distance function in my code? It is never used in this game."
2011-05-26T19:59:09  <demerzel> well i /think/ the spawn/explore radius are euclidian somehwo
2011-05-26T19:59:18  <demerzel> ofc spawn radius is basically 1 tile away so it isn't used much
2011-05-26T19:59:31  <demerzel> if you start trying to track where you have explored you might need it
2011-05-26T19:59:31  <Frontier> Except for the true/false evaluation of 'can I attack/see this', but that's just binary so it can go with squared distances
2011-05-26T20:00:24  <Frontier> yeah I guess I will at some point have a map with 'tile last seen in turn x'
2011-05-26T20:00:26  <bhasker> 5000 turns per game?
2011-05-26T20:01:08  <Frontier> probably to slow everything down a bit, so you can actually follow your 'played games' list
2011-05-26T20:01:09  <demerzel> i guess to wrap my head around the distances i just have to think of the tiles as points on a 2d plane for radius and tiles when considering move distance
2011-05-26T20:01:26  <bhasker> its too long:-\
2011-05-26T20:01:33  <bhasker> takes over 10 minutes to finish a game i think

2011-05-26T20:02:18  <demerzel> i think 5000 is breaking the visualizer tho
2011-05-26T20:02:21  * McLeopold upped it to 5000 for the hell of it
2011-05-26T20:02:22  <demerzel> makes it incredibly slow to respond

2011-05-26T20:03:09  <Frontier> lol, it is not the number of turns, but the speed, map size and ant count that gives the visualizer hickups :p
2011-05-26T20:04:01  <demerzel> no try skipping turns
2011-05-26T20:04:10  <demerzel> it goes 20x slower on the 5000 turn ones
2011-05-26T20:04:11  <demerzel> at least
2011-05-26T20:04:28  <Frontier> :/ don't skip more than 100 turns at once
2011-05-26T20:04:46  <demerzel> are you parsing the replay string on demand?
2011-05-26T20:04:57  <demerzel> that was my first thought
2011-05-26T20:05:13  <Frontier> yes, i did that when preloading was no longer possible due to the size of the games
2011-05-26T20:05:16  <demerzel> just preparse it and toss it in arrays it doesn't cost that much
2011-05-26T20:05:18  <demerzel> really
2011-05-26T20:05:24  <Frontier> you should have seen that before

2011-05-26T20:05:45  <demerzel> i have loaded huge data arrays in js before i am surprised
2011-05-26T20:06:03  <demerzel> you can thread it, just have an event when its done
2011-05-26T20:06:17  <demerzel> parse the first turn and loop turns but start the visualizer off
2011-05-26T20:06:18  <Frontier> demerzel: It is the best I could achieve: I load the replay, but parse it on demand. Then I cache the result in case you watch the replay again.
2011-05-26T20:06:45  <Frontier> JS is single threaded by design.
2011-05-26T20:07:08  <demerzel> async xmlhttp would disagree
2011-05-26T20:07:18  <jbroman> demerzel: No, it's still single-threaded.
2011-05-26T20:07:25  <jbroman> Asynchronous, but single-threaded.
2011-05-26T20:07:34  <jbroman> The callback will not run at the same time as your other JS.
2011-05-26T20:07:42  <demerzel> ok i don't mean physically threading
2011-05-26T20:07:43  <demerzel> sorry
2011-05-26T20:07:44  <jbroman> (Web workers are the only possible exception I think of.)
2011-05-26T20:07:52  <Frontier> you can also have a separate drawing thread, the key is that the JS execution itself is in one thread

2011-05-26T20:08:44  <demerzel> yea i guess you could make some kind of java webstart thing
2011-05-26T20:09:02  <jbroman> JavaScript being single-threaded is so nice, though.
2011-05-26T20:09:23  <Frontier> demerzel: That's right, I could parse turns in idle cycles.
2011-05-26T20:09:44  <demerzel> is it on github?  i don't know shit about python but i'm pretty good at optimizing js
2011-05-26T20:09:50  <demerzel> i've never screwed with gui either
2011-05-26T20:09:54  <demerzel> oh yea duh /visualizer
2011-05-26T20:10:35  <Frontier> Then again I made that difficult by designing the visualizer in a way I can set the cpu usage on playback. If I set it to 50% and do additional parsing the ppl that screamed "why does this take 100% cpu" in planet wars come back

2011-05-26T20:11:18  <demerzel> i pretty much expect java to take 100%
2011-05-26T20:11:39  <Frontier> planet wars had a JS visualizer, too
2011-05-26T20:12:06  <demerzel> wow its sad but i never thought to use case like that
2011-05-26T20:12:12  <demerzel> i didn't htink it would let it drop into another
2011-05-26T20:12:17  <Frontier> and it took all the cpu juice it could get. that made other web pages slow of course
2011-05-26T20:12:35  <Frontier> case?
2011-05-26T20:12:57  <demerzel> yea you have case 'n': then case 'N': [actual code]
2011-05-26T20:13:02  <demerzel> i didn't know it would let it drop through cases

2011-05-26T20:15:20  <Frontier> Most of that (ie the case construct and some other) come from working with C++

2011-05-26T20:18:25  <Frontier> The Replay.js code also has support for some old format replays in text format. It was good that I didn't delete it since McLeopold recently asked me to add support for loading map files directly into the visulizer.
2011-05-26T20:19:09  <demerzel> Frontier: where is the code that determines view radius
2011-05-26T20:19:14  <Frontier> So when you click on a map name in the game list you don't see the raw file, but the visualizer next to a download link
2011-05-26T20:19:19  <demerzel> have the feeling i'll understand it better than mcleo's python
2011-05-26T20:19:40  <Frontier> There is a function called something with fog in the replay
2011-05-26T20:20:07  <demerzel> cool ty
2011-05-26T20:20:10  <Frontier> It should be to the end of Replay.js. Fog is also calculated on a per-turn-basis

2011-05-26T20:20:42  <bhasker> it shows the same number no matter how many games my bot plays
2011-05-26T20:20:47  <Frontier> I tried a lot to get it faster in Rhino (the Java JS engine I use for IE8 and for the offline Java visualizer).

2011-05-26T20:23:16  <demerzel> i always see something new whenever i see any js talent
2011-05-26T20:23:45  <Frontier> meta is a property holding the meta data in the replay
2011-05-26T20:24:04  <demerzel> ah ok was just wondering
2011-05-26T20:24:36  <Frontier> there may be something like meta['playercolor'][0]. I use the [] syntax, because Googles Closure-Compiler (js minifier) would otherwise rename the properties
2011-05-26T20:24:56  <Frontier> that would be bad since they come from a json replay file.

2011-05-26T21:55:55  <computerwiz_222> I created the current design for the new website and I see that someone created the new brown background
2011-05-26T21:56:05  <amstan> computerwiz_222: yes, mcleopold did
2011-05-26T21:56:09  <computerwiz_222> I like how it looks, but I have just tested white and I think it looks good

2011-05-26T21:56:16  <computerwiz_222> no
2011-05-26T21:56:48  <computerwiz_222> when I originally created this design I didn't have any drop shadows so white looked odd -- white kind of works now

2011-05-26T22:37:25  <hjax> Go watch my bot, _Hjax_ on leaderboards, it's better than starter bot, but still sucks
2011-05-26T22:38:14  * hjax gets an idea for expansion
2011-05-26T22:39:19  <Frontier> hjax, how about not suiciding your ants?
2011-05-26T22:39:31  <hjax> I'm working on coding that
2011-05-26T22:39:47  <hjax> They like walking on top of eachother atm
2011-05-26T22:40:35  <Frontier> And I see a game where one ant is left sourrounded by lots of food, but it just walks around randomly
2011-05-26T22:40:59  <hjax> Because I added one change to the starter bot
2011-05-26T22:41:57  <hjax> Every few turns it should charge, going the same direction several times, I was trying to keep it from getting stuck in corners
2011-05-26T22:42:54  <Frontier> it doesn't look like it charges. it is more like a drunk ant.
2011-05-26T22:43:34  <hjax> Lol that's because the original starter bot code is still in control for 3/7 of my bots moves

2011-05-26T22:49:47  <hjax> How long is each turn btw?
2011-05-26T22:50:32  <Frontier> A problem I had when picking ants and targets was that my ants changed their target every turn. Now I build a looooong list of all ants vs all targets and pick those combinations that have the smallest distance. Then I remove all other entries in the list for this ant or target :)
2011-05-26T22:51:02  <Frontier> You have 1 second. How much you can do in this second depends on the cpu speed.
2011-05-26T22:51:26  <hjax> I'm figuring that for each ant I find the closest target, move and closer to target
2011-05-26T22:51:41  <Frontier> no
2011-05-26T22:52:00  <hjax> ? Why not?
2011-05-26T22:52:34  <hjax> Id keep a list of all the locations of the targets, to avoid conflicts

2011-05-26T22:57:47  <hjax> Lol anyone listens to it
2011-05-26T22:57:51  <Frontier> Every turn the ants come into your program in possibly a different order. So last turn you assigned #23 to a food item, next turn you assign #12, just because it is first in the list. This leads to your ants changing targets all the time. And what is worse: ...
2011-05-26T22:58:11  <Frontier> You wont always send the ant that is closest to a particular food item.
2011-05-26T22:58:18  <hjax> That's not how I was going to do it
2011-05-26T22:58:43  <Frontier> oh, then you are fine.
2011-05-26T22:58:54  <hjax> Each time I'd recalculate the closest food item for each ant, so it would keep them moving closer
2011-05-26T22:58:56  <amstan> though, you could track your ants
2011-05-26T22:59:04  <amstan> and label them individually
2011-05-26T22:59:07  <amstan> if you really need to
2011-05-26T22:59:16  <amstan> but your algorithms shouldn't need this
2011-05-26T22:59:33  <hjax> amstan: sure, make an anttracker class, save known ant locations, update dead ones
2011-05-26T22:59:53  <hjax> Its a waste of time though lol
2011-05-26T23:01:09  <Frontier> so do you send more than one ant to a food item?

2011-05-26T23:02:34  <hjax> Multiple ants might go for the same one, but one would get there first
2011-05-26T23:02:37  <Frontier> if not, you still need to take care of the above. otherwise you may send an ant to its closest food although a later ant is closer
2011-05-26T23:03:02  <amstan> that's why i would advise against doing it based on individual ants
2011-05-26T23:03:02  <hjax> And if I send 1 that happens ^^
2011-05-26T23:03:17  <amstan> you should be desiging your algorithms so your orders don't get out of date
2011-05-26T23:03:57  <Frontier> with later i mean: later in the list, but in the same turn
2011-05-26T23:04:09  <hjax> I know
2011-05-26T23:05:00  <hjax> Let's say any 23 is closer, ant 36 is a bit farther away, and 36 comes up first, and suddenly my list won't let the closer ant advance
2011-05-26T23:05:09  <hjax> Ant* not any
2011-05-26T23:05:21  <Frontier> I want an ant blob, an amoebia that moves across the map and caves in when an enemy comes close, just to close around it. *evilgrin*
2011-05-26T23:05:36  <hjax> That's awesome
2011-05-26T23:05:36  <amstan> Frontier: +1
2011-05-26T23:05:41  <amstan> i want ants that spell out things
2011-05-26T23:05:49  <amstan> and continue trying to do so until they die
2011-05-26T23:06:00  <hjax> I want armies and battle lines
2011-05-26T23:06:08  <Frontier> hjax, that's what I mean yes. it is good to be aware of that before you start coding.
2011-05-26T23:06:18  * hjax just finished studying the civil war
2011-05-26T23:08:07  <hjax> That amoeba is a really cool idea though
2011-05-26T23:09:42  <hjax> How about farmers? Guard an area and let it build up food until you can raise a huge army,
2011-05-26T23:10:35  <hjax> You could catch the enemy off guard, as most bots wouldn't have a mass of ants ready to counter
2011-05-26T23:12:08  <Frontier> If you control 10% of the map you only get 10% of the food. If another ant is good enough it will still outgrow you I think.
2011-05-26T23:12:42  <Frontier> But the amoeba has the same problem, I just think it is a funny idea to persue.
2011-05-26T23:12:54  <hjax> So? Control that 10% while using a regular food gathering strategy
2011-05-26T23:13:36  <hjax> What happening on a map with lots of lakes Frontier? Your amoeba would fall apart
2011-05-26T23:13:42  <hjax> Happens*
2011-05-26T23:14:08  <Frontier> :-( yeah it would have to move around lakes on both sides

2011-05-26T23:16:48  <Frontier> ah yes now I see there is more information than in planet wars
2011-05-26T23:17:00  <amstan> in planet wars there was gpm/worker
2011-05-26T23:17:05  <amstan> but i'm not sure how to get that now
2011-05-26T23:17:11  <amstan> it's broken in this version

2011-05-26T23:18:50  <Frontier> the failed submissions remind me of how i wasn't aware I had to change some data types for the 64-bit compiler on the server. I used uint everywhere while I should have used size_t.
2011-05-26T23:19:03  <hjax> How about an average skill? Or average bot length? Or total score generated?
2011-05-26T23:19:15  <hjax> For the general statistics
2011-05-26T23:19:29  <amstan> hjax: average skill will be 50
2011-05-26T23:19:35  <amstan> i tihnk
2011-05-26T23:19:44  <amstan> bot length?
2011-05-26T23:19:53  <amstan> total score generated should be just a sum i think
2011-05-26T23:19:53  <hjax> Lines if code
2011-05-26T23:19:57  <hjax> Of*
2011-05-26T23:20:07  <amstan> that is not in the db, and requires unpacking of the starter bots
2011-05-26T23:20:09  <amstan> so it's harder
2011-05-26T23:20:17  <Frontier> how about... avg time used per turn (0 to 1000 ms) by the bots
2011-05-26T23:20:26  <hjax> ^ good one
2011-05-26T23:20:29  <amstan> i still don't have that info
2011-05-26T23:20:43  <hjax> Food eaten?
2011-05-26T23:20:55  <hjax> Ants killed?
2011-05-26T23:21:04  <amstan> gpm/worker / average game length should tell that
2011-05-26T23:21:45  <amstan> depends on the worker config
2011-05-26T23:22:19  <hjax> Times a bot crashed during a battle?

2011-05-26T23:22:42  <amstan> i'm not sure
2011-05-26T23:22:53  <amstan> if you guys can find easy ways to include those infos in there
2011-05-26T23:23:00  <amstan> go right ahead, i'll pull
2011-05-26T23:23:43  <hjax> Lol I still need my bot to not walk in drunken circles
2011-05-26T23:23:55  <hjax> That's a job for tomorrow
2011-05-26T23:24:01  <antiuni> amstan: where do '%' lines come in?
2011-05-26T23:24:16  <hjax> I gtg, good night
2011-05-26T23:24:20  <amstan> antiuni: i have no idea, i'm not one of the game designers
2011-05-26T23:24:25  <amstan> antiuni: ask antimatroid
2011-05-26T23:24:28  <amstan> or mcleopold
2011-05-26T23:24:30  <Frontier> n8
2011-05-26T23:24:34  <antiuni> i am amtimatroid
2011-05-26T23:24:35  <amstan> maybe checkout a starter package
2011-05-26T23:24:49  <amstan> antiuni: so... why are you asking me? lol
2011-05-26T23:25:04  <antiuni> you told me the specs page needs to explain '%'?
2011-05-26T23:25:27  <Frontier> someone told me, so i told amstan who in turn told you, yes
2011-05-26T23:25:32  <amstan> antiuni: something that Frontier told me

2011-05-26T23:26:12  <antiuni> i think i use '%' to indicate water with the c++ starter bot when printing
2011-05-26T23:26:23  <antiuni> but i wouldn't have expected the specs page to need to outline that
2011-05-26T23:26:54  * Frontier feels there is a relation of replay size to duration. There is ~1KB per turn.
2011-05-26T23:26:57  * amstan thinks people should use ~ to indicate water
2011-05-26T23:27:00  <amstan> you know... waves
2011-05-26T23:27:14  <antiuni> i liked #
2011-05-26T23:27:17  <antiuni> with tron
2011-05-26T23:27:29  <amstan> yes.. # is fine for walls
2011-05-26T23:27:34  <amstan> but ~ is wavy, like water

2011-05-26T23:28:42  <antiuni> hmm, i'm not sure all keyboards have ~ on them either
2011-05-26T23:28:55  <amstan> what year is this?
2011-05-26T23:29:01  <amstan> then how do ppl type cd ~alex?
2011-05-26T23:29:28  <antiuni> i dunno, but i have some vague recollection of someone saying there were keyboards in some languages that didn't have ~ on them
2011-05-26T23:29:43  <antiuni> i could be completely off the mark :p
