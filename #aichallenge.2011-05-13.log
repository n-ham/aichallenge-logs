2011-05-13T00:42:30  <qacek> what time is loadtime and turntime supposed to be interpreted as? wall clock time?
2011-05-13T00:45:18  <antimatroid> yes wall clock
2011-05-13T00:45:31  <antimatroid> it's too hard to do cpu time
2011-05-13T00:45:36  <antimatroid> on multiple oses
2011-05-13T00:46:07  <antimatroid> however we have now got just one bot running at a time when making moves
2011-05-13T00:48:24  <qacek> sounds good

2011-05-13T17:02:56  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-13T17:05:37  <McLeopold> I've done some commits today and I can get a server running without jail users
2011-05-13T17:06:32  <amstan> McLeopold: should i reinstall my server?
2011-05-13T17:06:44  <McLeopold> probably
2011-05-13T17:06:47  <amstan> you did a lot of changes
2011-05-13T17:06:53  <amstan> is there a script that clears everything?
2011-05-13T17:07:12  <McLeopold> no, I tried doing that, but the jail stuff is pretty invasive
2011-05-13T17:07:31  <McLeopold> although, my changes don'r really touch that stuff
2011-05-13T17:07:48  <McLeopold> For some reason, the 'chown' commands don't stick
2011-05-13T17:08:10  <McLeopold> so, uploads doesn't get the www-data group after install.

2011-05-13T17:09:37  <mcstar> lol
2011-05-13T17:09:37  <amstan> anyway..
2011-05-13T17:09:41  <mcstar> amstan: you too?
2011-05-13T17:09:45  <amstan> so do we have a script that cleans everytihng up
2011-05-13T17:09:48  <amstan> mcstar: hmm? same problem?\
2011-05-13T17:09:49  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-13T17:09:55  <amstan> McLeopold: ok
2011-05-13T17:10:04  <McLeopold> you can try by hand
2011-05-13T17:10:08  <mcstar> in kde when i maximize any console except xterm
2011-05-13T17:10:11  <McLeopold> but the jail stuff is hard to undo
2011-05-13T17:10:31  <amstan> is it? last time i just had to remove all the jail users and clean the /srv stuff
2011-05-13T17:10:40  <McLeopold> plus the iptables
2011-05-13T17:10:47  <McLeopold> and the fstab stuff
2011-05-13T17:11:02  <McLeopold> I hosed one VM trying :(
2011-05-13T17:11:04  <mcstar> amstan: can u look at dmesg?
2011-05-13T17:11:09  <amstan> iptables? is there a problem is the script runs again on them?

2011-05-13T17:11:41  <McLeopold> I didn't really try to understand the jail stuff, so I don't know what will happen.
2011-05-13T17:11:42  <amstan_> mcstar: well.. did it again

2011-05-13T17:12:03  <mcstar> nvidia?
2011-05-13T17:12:04  <McLeopold> I think the check is just to look for the /srv, and if it's there, skip all jail stuff

2011-05-13T17:12:45  <McLeopold> you could try to clean it up, it's pretty quick
2011-05-13T17:12:56  <amstan_> mcstar: let's talk in #kde-dev about this or something
2011-05-13T17:12:57  <McLeopold> the worker install takes awhile to redo
2011-05-13T17:13:06  <amstan_> McLeopold: yes, i'll delete the /home/contest actually
2011-05-13T17:13:06  <mcstar> yeah
2011-05-13T17:13:11  <mcstar> can u do that?
2011-05-13T17:13:17  <amstan_> McLeopold: what about the apache settings?
2011-05-13T17:13:22  <mcstar> i never filed a bugreport
2011-05-13T17:13:22  <McLeopold> they are new
2011-05-13T17:13:30  <McLeopold> I've got some rewrites in there
2011-05-13T17:13:38  <amstan_> McLeopold: yes, but don't i have to clean them up?
2011-05-13T17:13:57  <McLeopold> I think maybe you do, it checks for an existing conf file?
2011-05-13T17:14:21  <amstan_> McLeopold: ok.. i think i can just apt-get purge apache mysql
2011-05-13T17:14:27  <amstan_> and it'll take care of them
2011-05-13T17:16:11  <McLeopold> it just checks for the sites-available/ai-contest.com file
2011-05-13T17:16:16  <McLeopold> so, just remove that
2011-05-13T17:16:33  <McLeopold> most of the changes are just the server_settings and directory changes
2011-05-13T17:17:06  <McLeopold> also, I decided on ai-contest.com/ants/games/0 as the permalink for replay files
2011-05-13T17:17:57  <McLeopold> mcstar: have you tried the newer stderr stuff?
2011-05-13T17:18:26  <mcstar> i will
2011-05-13T17:18:28  <mcstar> not yet
2011-05-13T17:20:50  <amstan_> McLeopold: those are the replay files though, shouldn't the visualizer pages be permalinked?
2011-05-13T17:21:19  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-13T17:21:37  <McLeopold> the permanant resource is the data, not the presentation
2011-05-13T17:22:00  <amstan_> yes, but if someone wants to link to a game for his resume, he would want to link to the visualizer
2011-05-13T17:22:07  <McLeopold> not that the visualizer shouldn't be a permalink either
2011-05-13T17:22:12  <amstan_> not to a json formatted replay
2011-05-13T17:22:16  <amstan_> yeah
2011-05-13T17:22:23  <amstan_> so what i
2011-05-13T17:22:32  <amstan_> so what i'm thinking is that we should just use subdomains
2011-05-13T17:22:42  <McLeopold> so ai-contest/visualizer.php?game_id=0 is not specific to the game
2011-05-13T17:23:05  <amstan_> ants.ai-contest.com/visualizer?game_id=0 would be
2011-05-13T17:23:22  <McLeopold> so, what I suggested last week? :p
2011-05-13T17:23:28  <amstan_> well.. yeah
2011-05-13T17:23:37  <McLeopold> @seen j3camero
2011-05-13T17:23:37  <contestbot> McLeopold: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 2 weeks, 3 days, 19 hours, 49 minutes, and 39 seconds ago: <j3camero> amstan: no no I ust bought the game. But I have self control don't worry.
2011-05-13T17:23:39  <amstan_> i'm just annoyed that we have to change things so much though
2011-05-13T17:23:50  <amstan_> McLeopold: if we both agree on it we don't need him
2011-05-13T17:24:02  <McLeopold> we outvote janzert?
2011-05-13T17:24:13  <amstan_> is janzert against it?
2011-05-13T17:24:17  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-13T17:24:32  <McLeopold> I'm not sure he's given an option
2011-05-13T17:24:41  <amstan_> hmm?
2011-05-13T17:24:57  <McLeopold> so, do we break visualizer stuff with a subdomain, the same-site javascript rule?
2011-05-13T17:25:27  <amstan_> no, we just move the whole contest to $contestname.ai-contest.com
2011-05-13T17:25:37  <amstan_> redirect from ai-contest.com to the newwest one
2011-05-13T17:25:55  <amstan_> and by $contestname i mean something that won't interfiere with others
2011-05-13T17:26:01  <amstan_> so idk if i would just say "ants"
2011-05-13T17:26:29  <McLeopold> I think ants is specific enough: (rps, tron, pw, ants)
2011-05-13T17:26:47  <amstan_> we might do another tron contest though
2011-05-13T17:26:47  <McLeopold> you'd have to have a lot of contests to get some repetition
2011-05-13T17:26:51  <McLeopold> tron2
2011-05-13T17:26:55  <amstan_> oh.. right
2011-05-13T17:26:57  <amstan_> ok
2011-05-13T17:27:00  <amstan_> i'm fine with that
2011-05-13T17:27:10  <McLeopold> but...
2011-05-13T17:27:20  <McLeopold> a lot would guess tron as the name
2011-05-13T17:27:41  <McLeopold> I think a link on tron saying it is the old competition and a link would be enough
2011-05-13T17:27:48  <amstan_> yes
2011-05-13T17:27:59  <amstan_> just remeber that when tron2 gets released and it's in progress
2011-05-13T17:28:08  <amstan_> the url bar of all users will show http://tron2.ai-contest.com
2011-05-13T17:28:15  <amstan_> so it'll be kinda hard to make the mistake
2011-05-13T17:28:22  <McLeopold> so, can you register the subdomains?
2011-05-13T17:28:45  <amstan_> i can't, i need to ping j3camero about that
2011-05-13T17:28:51  <amstan_> but i'm sure it's possible
2011-05-13T17:29:18  <amstan_> most dns services offer a catch all rule

2011-05-13T17:36:13  <amstan> you were talking about that
2011-05-13T17:36:16  <amstan> how is it done?
2011-05-13T17:36:21  <McLeopold> the rewrite rule takes care of that
2011-05-13T17:36:46  <McLeopold> 2 levels with a 1000 file limit
2011-05-13T17:37:08  <amstan> no, i was talking about the folders in /home/contest
2011-05-13T17:37:29  <McLeopold> on the back end it would be /home/contest/games/123456/7890/12345678901234.replay
2011-05-13T17:38:32  <amstan> ok.. anyway

2011-05-13T17:43:54  <McLeopold> he comes out of nowhere with a technical answer
2011-05-13T17:44:58  <amstan> k, now i'm fighting with removing the stuff in /srv, apparently it's still in use, even though i deleted fstab, the users and rebooted

2011-05-13T18:00:59  <McLeopold> I think the port number is going to need to be fixed by hand in some of the config files

2011-05-13T18:01:49  <amstan> port number should be default

2011-05-13T18:24:49  <amstan> McLeopold: so now uploads is different than submissions?
2011-05-13T18:24:55  <amstan> submissions is only used by the worker?
2011-05-13T18:24:59  <McLeopold> there is not submissions

2011-05-13T18:26:50  <amstan> ok, decent
2011-05-13T18:26:55  <amstan> let's get on to the worker
2011-05-13T18:27:04  <McLeopold> do it without jails first
2011-05-13T18:27:29  <amstan> how?
2011-05-13T18:27:44  <McLeopold> did you already run the worker_setup.py?
2011-05-13T18:28:00  <amstan> no
2011-05-13T18:28:09  <McLeopold> there's an options for no jail users
2011-05-13T18:28:12  <amstan> i have to set the api_create_key
2011-05-13T18:28:19  <McLeopold> that's in the script
2011-05-13T18:28:20  <amstan> and then get a worker key first
2011-05-13T18:28:36  <amstan> script? what script?
2011-05-13T18:28:41  <amstan> api_create_key is empty right now
2011-05-13T18:28:58  <McLeopold> nvm, I'll watch
2011-05-13T18:29:08  <amstan> how big is the key again? i forgot?
2011-05-13T18:29:19  <amstan> 64 hex digits?
2011-05-13T18:29:24  <McLeopold> I thought it was arbitrary
2011-05-13T18:29:36  <amstan> oh..
2011-05-13T18:29:40  <amstan> contestbot had some code.. i tihnk

2011-05-13T18:29:57  <amstan> nvm
2011-05-13T18:31:40  <McLeopold> I see a bug with latest_game_id/last_game_id
2011-05-13T18:31:55  <amstan> McLeopold: that's because there's no last_game_id
2011-05-13T18:32:01  <amstan> it defaults on the other one then
2011-05-13T18:32:17  <amstan> the problem i'm having is how it doesn't detect that we do have an api_create_key
2011-05-13T18:32:56  <McLeopold> I was just inconsistant between the memcache name and the php var, no bug
2011-05-13T18:33:17  <McLeopold> I've never used the api_create_key stuff
2011-05-13T18:33:26  <amstan> why am i getting this:  [Fri May 13 18:32:42 2011] [error] [client 192.168.0.1] PHP Notice:  Undefined index: api_create_key in /home/contest/aichallenge/website/api_server_setup.php on lin

2011-05-13T18:34:01  <amstan> right..
2011-05-13T18:34:08  <amstan> i need to do the get variable thing
2011-05-13T18:34:27  <amstan> there we go
2011-05-13T18:35:14  <amstan> McLeopold: do you think we should skip the jails then?
2011-05-13T18:35:15  <McLeopold> I never updated api_server_setup, it's still pulling from googlecode
2011-05-13T18:35:20  <McLeopold> yes, for now
2011-05-13T18:35:24  <amstan> ok
2011-05-13T18:35:48  <McLeopold> You'll need to add a key to the worker/server_info
2011-05-13T18:35:51  <amstan> well.. that was short
2011-05-13T18:36:07  <amstan> the setup does that
2011-05-13T18:36:15  <McLeopold> "secure_jail": False,
2011-05-13T18:36:37  <amstan> the setup should do that*
2011-05-13T18:36:45  <McLeopold> true
2011-05-13T18:37:03  <McLeopold> not in game options
2011-05-13T18:37:19  <amstan> there we go
2011-05-13T18:37:38  <amstan> seems to like us
2011-05-13T18:37:43  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-05-13T18:37:52  <McLeopold> let me do a few things?
2011-05-13T18:37:56  <amstan> sure
2011-05-13T18:38:38  <amstan> McLeopold: no pass
2011-05-13T18:38:57  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-05-13T18:39:23  <amstan> may i check the settings?
2011-05-13T18:39:26  <McLeopold> y
2011-05-13T18:39:55  <McLeopold> the import was relative?
2011-05-13T18:39:59  <amstan> no
2011-05-13T18:40:03  <amstan> oh yeah..
2011-05-13T18:40:04  <amstan> rpobably
2011-05-13T18:40:16  <amstan> anyway.. seems like the manager has the wrong pass somehow
2011-05-13T18:41:07  <amstan> McLeopold: try now
2011-05-13T18:41:29  <amstan> McLeopold: shouldn't this work? http://hypertriangle.com:13080/visualizer.php?game_id=0
2011-05-13T18:41:33  <amstan> we already ran a game
2011-05-13T18:42:12  <McLeopold> the www-data group doesn't stick

2011-05-13T18:42:46  <McLeopold> it was in the setup script
2011-05-13T18:43:05  <amstan> ok, then we might want to use acls instead of chown

2011-05-13T18:43:28  <McLeopold> ok, why don't you do that
2011-05-13T18:43:35  <amstan> but hold on.. why didn't this work?
2011-05-13T18:43:54  <McLeopold> the api_.php files want to write to a log file in ~/logs
2011-05-13T18:44:18  <McLeopold> It's the crappiest logging system ever
2011-05-13T18:44:32  <amstan> yeah, well.. php
2011-05-13T18:44:53  <amstan> McLeopold: when did those folders loose the permissions though?
2011-05-13T18:45:11  <McLeopold> I'm not sure

2011-05-13T18:45:46  <amstan> worker_setup did it
2011-05-13T18:45:56  <amstan> see the screen
2011-05-13T18:45:56  <McLeopold> ahh
2011-05-13T18:46:14  <amstan> anyway..
2011-05-13T18:46:17  <amstan> let's continue on

2011-05-13T18:46:49  <amstan> i want that!
2011-05-13T18:46:53  <McLeopold> hold on...
2011-05-13T18:47:15  <McLeopold> 2000 turns, might be awhile :)
2011-05-13T18:47:28  <McLeopold> And permissions always got me here too
2011-05-13T18:47:53  <McLeopold> do we need the group suid on the games dir if apache does mkdir?
2011-05-13T18:48:56  <amstan> i'm not too familiar with what the suid bit does
2011-05-13T18:49:14  <amstan> i gave up on understanding chmod/chroot and switched to acls on some things
2011-05-13T18:49:23  <amstan> btw, it's done
2011-05-13T18:49:57  <_flag> The site looks really nice btw, is it almost ready?

2011-05-13T18:51:40  <McLeopold> plus, external workers don't download maps yet...
2011-05-13T18:51:46  <McLeopold> I'll get that soon
2011-05-13T18:52:10  <McLeopold> This game takes awhile to play
2011-05-13T18:52:24  <amstan> McLeopold: the server has crappy hardware
2011-05-13T18:52:30  <McLeopold> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/games/0
2011-05-13T18:52:37  <McLeopold> apache isn't correct
2011-05-13T18:52:45  <amstan> i was thinking of making a htpc out of it, but i doubt it'll do 1080p decoding

2011-05-13T18:55:29  <McLeopold> same way
2011-05-13T18:55:45  <McLeopold> It will probably mess up the dir owners again, too

2011-05-13T19:47:21  <McLeopold> still a bug in worker
2011-05-13T19:47:26  <amstan> yeah, i see
2011-05-13T19:49:16  <amstan> McLeopold: how do we clear the jails? none of them should be in use now
2011-05-13T19:49:24  <McLeopold> idk
2011-05-13T19:49:31  <amstan> restart?
2011-05-13T19:49:44  <McLeopold> maybe, I think there were some files in worker somewhere
2011-05-13T19:51:00  <McLeopold> amstan: sanbox line 29
2011-05-13T19:51:05  <McLeopold> it makes dirs
2011-05-13T19:52:50  <McLeopold> amstan: if it can't create the dir, it considers it locked
2011-05-13T19:52:56  <McLeopold> so we make have more permission issues

2011-05-13T19:54:38  <amstan> seems to be fine
2011-05-13T19:55:02  <McLeopold> it tries to make the dir in /srv/chroot
2011-05-13T19:55:11  <amstan> that's wrong though
2011-05-13T19:55:15  <amstan> it shouldn't
2011-05-13T19:55:29  <amstan> that stuff should only be touched by worker_setup
2011-05-13T19:55:33  <amstan> that stuff is in fstab
2011-05-13T19:56:02  <McLeopold> but the system as a whole needs to be able to pick a jail first
2011-05-13T19:56:33  <amstan> yes, but the contest user should not be making dirs inside /srv/chroot/ directly

2011-05-13T19:58:57  <McLeopold> whoever the worker runs as needs to do the locking
2011-05-13T19:59:14  <amstan> worker runs as contest
2011-05-13T19:59:27  <amstan> i'm saying that the worker shouldn't be trying to make folders in /srv/chroot directly
2011-05-13T19:59:37  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-13T19:59:46  <McLeopold> in the worker dir then?
2011-05-13T19:59:53  <amstan> maybe the folder to be created should be in /srv/chroot/jailuser1/home/home/jailuser/$here
2011-05-13T20:00:10  <McLeopold> but that is for a jail user, not contest
2011-05-13T20:00:14  <amstan> idk, i didn't design the sandbox, but i'm sure it's not /srv/chroot/$here
2011-05-13T20:00:23  <McLeopold> /home/contest/worker/jail_locks?
2011-05-13T20:00:43  <McLeopold> wait, I read the code wrong
2011-05-13T20:00:56  <McLeopold> lock_dir is /srv/chroot/jailuser1/locked
2011-05-13T20:01:34  <amstan>  /srv/chroot/jailuser$n/ is owned by jailkeeper
2011-05-13T20:02:19  <McLeopold> a user or group?

2011-05-13T21:45:45  <janzert> amstan: rather than not setting the group on directories in the worker_setup, it seems like it may be better to set the group everywhere but not set recursively from the contest_root only from the local_repo root
2011-05-13T21:46:30  <janzert> I don't believe www-data should ever be writing to the compiled or map directories
2011-05-13T21:48:52  <amriedle> hmmm
2011-05-13T21:49:23  <Frontier> janzert: have you though about adding a contact form to the web site or an about page listing the responsible people?
2011-05-13T21:49:48  <janzert> I haven't thought about any website content at all really
2011-05-13T21:49:59  <janzert> that's Amstan's deparment ;)
2011-05-13T21:50:05  <janzert> department even
2011-05-13T21:51:31  <Frontier> It has to do with public relations somewhat.
2011-05-13T21:52:25  <janzert> which is even further from what I try and deal with :P
2011-05-13T21:52:27  <Frontier> actually it was my mother who was missing that :p, but ok. IRC is a good platform, too
2011-05-13T21:53:12  <Frontier> janzert: oh you never did that? then it must have been jeff's job all the time
2011-05-13T21:53:16  <janzert> A contact page sounds fine with me
2011-05-13T21:53:27  <janzert> yeah, Jeff handles pretty much all the PR I think
2011-05-13T21:53:48  <janzert> of course a contact page means there needs to be someone to contact that will respond
2011-05-13T21:54:05  <Frontier> that was a nice subliminal hint ^^
2011-05-13T21:54:25  <janzert> I think there used to be a link to Jeff's email but the problem was it could be weeks before a response
2011-05-13T21:55:33  <Frontier> all right, never mind then. there is always someone here to answer basic questions and forward the rest
2011-05-13T21:56:15  <janzert> the contact page could list the forums and IRC channel?
2011-05-13T21:56:23  <janzert> skip an email address
2011-05-13T21:56:27  <Frontier> they are on the front page anyway
2011-05-13T21:56:31  <janzert> ahh
2011-05-13T21:56:47  <janzert> yeah, I don't even look at the webpages a whole lot ;)
2011-05-13T21:58:28  <Frontier> Interestingly I just read that in Germany you should add legal info to your web site as soon as you make money with it, even if it is just banner ads. Don't know about canadian laws.
