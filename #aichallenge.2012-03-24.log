2012-03-24T10:12:25  <UncleVasya> Hi, Smiley. Your host is the first I have ping to less than 2,5 sec.
2012-03-24T10:12:49  <UncleVasya> So I make a conclusion Australia is a nice country :)
2012-03-24T10:17:38  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: I'm glad to see you on the server. :) Though actually it's hosted in Atlanta.

2012-03-24T10:19:47  <UncleVasya> Does your work on Asteroids and Wargame in any way related with contest organizers?
2012-03-24T10:21:44  <smiley1983> no - I just did a bit of work on aerique's Asteroids game, and then made wargame to see if anyone was interested
2012-03-24T10:24:39  <UncleVasya> btw, I'm glad to see you too.

2012-03-24T10:47:41  <smiley1983> UncleVasya: my internet line drops out all the time (like it did then): fortunately I'm running the bots on the tcp server itself, so they keep going even when that happens.
2012-03-24T10:48:23  <smiley1983> I tried to get Xathis' bot running there as well, but I'm too incompetent to compile the Java, even looking at the args used in the server code. :/
2012-03-24T10:48:48  <UncleVasya> I'm looking at the result and worring about an appelation you can decide to write :D
2012-03-24T10:48:53  <UncleVasya> *results

2012-03-24T10:51:41  <UncleVasya> Server rank is frosen.
2012-03-24T10:52:08  <UncleVasya> *ranking page
2012-03-24T10:52:21  <smiley1983> Oh, indeed. I haven't worked out how to update that.
2012-03-24T10:53:02  <smiley1983> In fact, I've probably broken the ability to update it at all by combining the sources into on dir

2012-03-24T10:57:18  <UncleVasya> Maybe these cutoff-s aren't needed anymore?
2012-03-24T10:57:56  <smiley1983> That's true... they probably wouldn't be hard to disable
2012-03-24T10:59:32  <Accoun> http://213.88.39.97:2080/ranking  cutoff disabled, rank changet ok
2012-03-24T11:02:01  <smiley1983> Accoun: can you tell me how to enable the ranking page?
2012-03-24T11:13:57  <smiley1983> I think I might have disabled the cutoffs, we'll see if any more show up. Ranking page remains a mystery to me.

2012-03-24T22:10:28  <antimatroid> bah, usb is always correct on the 3rd try :P
2012-03-24T22:12:05  <amstan> antimatroid: how can USB be incorrect?
2012-03-24T22:12:14  <antimatroid> plugging it in
2012-03-24T22:12:21  <antimatroid> it's always the 3rd way around that you try it
2012-03-24T22:12:28  <antimatroid> ie. right the first time, but didn't seem like it
2012-03-24T22:24:06  <amstan> antimatroid: probably an OS issue
2012-03-24T22:24:14  <amstan> windows?
2012-03-24T22:24:37  <antimatroid> not sure if joking or completely misunderstanding me? :P
2012-03-24T22:25:05  <amstan> so.. USB as in universal serial bus?
2012-03-24T22:25:16  <amstan> you plug the device in and only the 3rd time it works?
2012-03-24T22:39:43  <Chris_0076> xD

2012-03-24T23:28:00  <antimatroid> amstan: I mean when you go to plug it in it doesn't fit into the hole until the third try
