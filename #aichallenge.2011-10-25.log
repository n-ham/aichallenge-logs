2011-10-25T00:37:17  <a1k0n> not only are there dups, but why on earth did it go from (23,20) to (28,21)
2011-10-25T00:37:39  <a1k0n> and are you maintaining a closed set?
2011-10-25T00:38:06  <kfjlasd> what do you mean exactly?
2011-10-25T00:38:19  <antimatroid> don't add a location to the queue more than once
2011-10-25T00:38:20  <a1k0n> in A*, usually there's an open set and a closed set, the latter being the set of nodes already explored
2011-10-25T00:38:25  <analyst74> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode
2011-10-25T00:38:34  <a1k0n> so each time you try an add, you check the closed set first
2011-10-25T00:38:43  <kfjlasd> yes, i have a set of explored states
2011-10-25T00:39:08  <antimatroid>  don't think you need open and closed sets on a grid?
2011-10-25T00:39:18  <a1k0n> sure you do
2011-10-25T00:39:27  <a1k0n> you don't need closed sets in continuous space usually
2011-10-25T00:39:35  <antimatroid> nah, cause the first time you come across a location it's going to be the fastest you can get to it
2011-10-25T00:39:43  <antimatroid> so why bother checking if you find a shorter path later?
2011-10-25T00:39:51  <antimatroid> just mark a location as added when you add it to the queue and don't add it again
2011-10-25T00:40:11  <analyst74> only works as long as you don't pop the queue
2011-10-25T00:40:13  <a1k0n> right, you can impement the "closed set" by just putting some info into the square on the grid
2011-10-25T00:40:45  <antimatroid> so you only really need closed and not open?
2011-10-25T00:41:01  <a1k0n> you need open -- that's your queue of stuff to check
2011-10-25T00:41:02  <antimatroid> open is for when added to the queue but not taken off yeah?
2011-10-25T00:41:07  <a1k0n> closed just keeps you from looping

2011-10-25T01:52:08  <Stasmo> if i am trying to grow an army, higher priority is placed on the gathering of foooood
2011-10-25T01:52:26  <mleise> Is the priority different for every ant?
2011-10-25T01:52:44  <Stasmo> if i want to crush bases, i can change the status to kill mode or something and then higher priority goes to finding and killing enemies

2011-10-25T01:53:02  <Stasmo> currently
2011-10-25T01:53:31  <mleise> The currently it sounds like a good idea to use a priority queue for that
2011-10-25T01:53:33  <Stasmo> although getting them to decide their own priorities would be a good idea
2011-10-25T01:54:32  <mleise> it always has the best order right in front of the list

2011-10-25T02:00:20  <pvinis> are we supposed to change only the MyBot file?
2011-10-25T02:00:28  <pvinis> or the ants file as well?
2011-10-25T02:00:31  <amstan> pvinis: nope, change whatever you want
2011-10-25T02:00:51  <pvinis> oh ok
2011-10-25T02:01:22  <pvinis> because there are some functions in ants.py that are not in the ants.rb file
2011-10-25T02:01:56  <amstan> pvinis: if you can fix that, we could update the starter packages from the main site to include your fix
2011-10-25T02:02:03  <Stasmo> if you look through all the code, you can see that the way they got this to work in several languages is because these different technologies interact by passing eachother strings
2011-10-25T02:02:15  <pvinis> i will later today
2011-10-25T02:02:19  <Stasmo> and then parsing passed strings
2011-10-25T02:02:38  <Stasmo> so make sure you pass the right string when given the right info and you can do whatever you want with this code
2011-10-25T02:02:41  <pvinis> yes i saw that, but some useful things are missing from the ruby files
2011-10-25T02:02:45  <Stasmo> it's brilliant!

2011-10-25T03:16:32  <Garf> generally speaking, on average, depends on lots of factors blabla
2011-10-25T03:18:08  <thestinger> cpython is 25x-50x slower*
2011-10-25T03:18:11  <thestinger> http://speed.pypy.org/ :P
2011-10-25T03:18:25  <thestinger> for this contest I guess we're stuck with cpython though
2011-10-25T03:18:29  <Garf> you can't use pypy afaik

2011-10-25T03:19:20  <ikaros> i use lua and it's quite fast.. especially with luajit
2011-10-25T03:20:02  <Fandekasp> funny to see python in #1 for a 25-50x slower language :P
2011-10-25T03:20:37  <ikaros> good algos always beat brute force i guess :)
2011-10-25T03:20:38  <Garf> development speed matters too. particularly as prolly noone really knows yet what good strategy is
2011-10-25T03:22:21  <Fandekasp> dear, and I can't even do the basic A* stuff xD

2011-10-25T06:05:08  <SharkMonkey> How do tcpservers give you faster feedback?
2011-10-25T06:07:09  <aerique> SharkMonkey: more control over when you will play, no need to upload to the official site, more games
2011-10-25T06:08:40  <SharkMonkey> How is that better than running locally though?
2011-10-25T06:08:53  <SharkMonkey> with playgame.py
2011-10-25T06:08:55  <aerique> SharkMonkey: you get to play against other people's bots
2011-10-25T06:09:17  <SharkMonkey> Oh. Without revealing your source to them?
2011-10-25T06:09:31  <SharkMonkey> Where are these tcp servers then?
2011-10-25T06:10:36  <aerique> SharkMonkey: yeah, without revealing your source.  someone else will need to chip in on the actual tcp servers, i haven't started participating yet :)

2011-10-25T06:39:08  <tampe125> hi, i have a question
2011-10-25T06:39:31  <tampe125> should i track down dead ants, too?
2011-10-25T06:39:50  <bobbydroptable> depends on how you're keeping track of ants
2011-10-25T06:40:08  <bobbydroptable> if you're deciding the action of each available ant each turn , then you probably don't need to worry about ants that are dead
2011-10-25T06:40:24  <tampe125> ok thanks
2011-10-25T06:40:28  <bobbydroptable> but i think most people are developing ways to keep track of ants across turns, so that they can assign tasks to individual ants
2011-10-25T06:40:31  <akosch> can I use BSD3-licensed code in my bot?
2011-10-25T06:40:43  <bobbydroptable> in that case, you'll want to know when a ant is dead, so you can reassign task
2011-10-25T06:41:45  <akosch> e.g. can I use any third-party code at all?
2011-10-25T06:41:52  <tampe125> ok, but the dead array contains the last known position? or where they died?
2011-10-25T06:42:04  <bobbydroptable> should be where they died
2011-10-25T06:42:24  <tampe125> thnkas
2011-10-25T06:42:49  <bobbydroptable> akosch: not sure on the rules regarding that. shouldn't be a problem I think.
2011-10-25T06:43:05  <bobbydroptable> there's only so many ways to do an A* search lol
2011-10-25T06:43:27  <akosch> bobbydroptable: yeah, the compiler is BSD3 too... so I guess it's ok

2011-10-25T07:48:42  <olexs> is resetting skill after reupload a feature? it's quite annoying, at current game speed it takes more than a day to get anywhere near top
2011-10-25T07:49:49  <hacklash> is there a way to play on a random map using playgame.py?
2011-10-25T07:50:58  <hacklash> i agree with olexs, rank should start where you left off. if the bot is worse the matching algorithm will find out
2011-10-25T07:51:18  <hacklash> but presumably it is the same or better
2011-10-25T07:52:58  <antimatroid> olexs: use tcp for testing for bot :P

2011-10-25T07:53:26  <antimatroid> resetting requires you to see how your bot does against lower ranked bots and makes it harder for people to keep resubmitting every time they lose a game

2011-10-25T08:06:48  <calsmurf2904> Hello, I'm just starting out (with AI programming in general) and I'm currently implementing Pathfinding so I can explore maps etc. without getting stuck....the pathfinding works great but with 20+ ants I get a timeout because it takes way too long for it to calculate paths for all those ants
2011-10-25T08:07:25  <calsmurf2904> Could somebody give me some advice to how I can fix this? I'm using A* pathfinding

2011-10-25T08:11:34  <calsmurf2904> Yes, I was thinking about that...I'm currently also trying to force it to queue the ants who need a new path and just calculate 7 paths per turn
2011-10-25T08:11:49  <calsmurf2904> I'm using my own implementation (which ofcourse isn't really efficient)

2011-10-25T08:59:30  <teuneboon> hmm, indeed I see
2011-10-25T08:59:36  <sir_macelon> maybe sorting in python doesn't work correctly
2011-10-25T08:59:52  <sir_macelon> but I don't know python
2011-10-25T09:00:06  <delt0r> not very likely considering how many use it
2011-10-25T09:00:24  <teuneboon> I know a bit of python, but the sorting there is still somewhat of a mistery to me :P

2011-10-25T09:01:07  <teuneboon> it should sort on distance if I look at the code
2011-10-25T09:01:10  <teuneboon> strange
2011-10-25T09:01:58  <sir_macelon> I am reviewing McLeopolds java part and it gives me different outcome
2011-10-25T09:02:19  <sir_macelon> so for Java it works correctly, so I assume python is broken
2011-10-25T09:02:47  <sir_macelon> or it is not the actual code in the reply...
2011-10-25T09:03:06  <teuneboon> maybe run the python code locally?
2011-10-25T09:03:40  <Garf> what snippet are we talking about?

2011-10-25T09:06:04  <sir_macelon> I am working on java tutorial and trying to fix this
2011-10-25T09:06:22  <sir_macelon> teuneboon: I wouldn't go into python now, maybe you could try
2011-10-25T09:06:39  <Garf> is the problem the tuple unpacking?
2011-10-25T09:06:59  <teuneboon> would have to switch computers to do the python thing XD
2011-10-25T09:07:30  <teuneboon> or install python here
2011-10-25T09:07:31  <teuneboon> :P
2011-10-25T09:08:33  <sir_macelon> teuneboon: well, I don't care about python anyway :P
2011-10-25T09:08:46  <teuneboon> haha, kind of the same here XD
2011-10-25T09:08:56  <teuneboon> started making my bot in Java, now converting to javascript
2011-10-25T09:09:05  <teuneboon> since I kind of started that starter bot I think I should use it XD
2011-10-25T09:09:31  <sir_macelon> teuneboon: oh, I thought you were on python, nvm then

2011-10-25T09:12:29  <teuneboon> only thing I see that's possible is that the actual distance code in the python package uses manhattan distance
2011-10-25T09:12:33  <teuneboon> but that would be weird
2011-10-25T09:12:41  <ikaros> i think the python code just finds the nearest ant for every food. but if an ant has 2 possibilities it just sends the ant to the first food processed in the loop

2011-10-25T09:13:52  <antimatroid> that's a good point actually
2011-10-25T09:13:53  <vladimirfol> can i write my Bot on python & C using ctypes
2011-10-25T09:13:55  <ikaros> well the list for each food is sorted
2011-10-25T09:13:59  <antimatroid> you want to use manhatten for path finding, not euclidean
2011-10-25T09:14:01  <vladimirfol> >
2011-10-25T09:14:20  <antimatroid> and you need to make sure you wrap your distance functions
2011-10-25T09:14:36  <teuneboon> I know antimatroid
2011-10-25T09:14:43  <vladimirfol> i will compile C library source to shared objects library (*.so in linux, *.dll in Windows) on my own computer, send the lib to the server and will call functions from the library in python Bot (using module 'ctypes').
2011-10-25T09:14:43  <ikaros> maybe i get it wrong im no python guy either
2011-10-25T09:14:43  <teuneboon> but the starter packages should use euclidean
2011-10-25T09:14:51  <sir_macelon> well, java tutorial is even more broken, TreeMap was not a good choice to sort distances as it eliminates all other paths with the same distance...
2011-10-25T09:14:53  <antimatroid> no they shouldn't
2011-10-25T09:15:06  <teuneboon> oh ok XD
2011-10-25T09:15:16  <teuneboon> they do however don't  they?
2011-10-25T09:15:20  <antimatroid> i say that even though i only gave hte euclidean metric in the c++ one
2011-10-25T09:15:28  <antimatroid> but i also didn't do anything related to path finding for people there

2011-10-25T09:19:25  <antimatroid> and it's easy to see that the two metrics are not equivalence with

2011-10-25T09:31:27  <monkeys> right, but I'm trying to say scan the area given by the various radii so although this link can show me if something is within range, it's not valid for say looking 2 squares to the west and seeing what's there.  Is that right?

2011-10-25T10:15:16  <ikaros> are there any plans to upgrade servers further btw?
2011-10-25T10:15:33  <bearoff_w> at least there are 5 servers now
2011-10-25T10:15:38  <bearoff_w> yesterday it was 3
2011-10-25T10:15:45  <bearoff_w> and 2 at beginning
2011-10-25T10:16:16  <ikaros> i see 5 listed but they have names #7 - #11
2011-10-25T10:16:47  <bearoff_w> there can be a lot of reasons )
2011-10-25T10:16:52  <ikaros> =)
2011-10-25T10:17:43  <sir_macelon> ikaros: every started server gets a new ID, so this is not the actual count

2011-10-25T10:34:08  <liberforce> i don't think static linkage would work, as the server rebuilds the bots...
2011-10-25T10:34:26  <sir_macelon> McLeopold: I've finished reviewing and updating the Java tutorial, you can have a look if everything's fine
2011-10-25T10:34:29  <liberforce> but i don't know which OS the server uses
2011-10-25T10:34:33  <f4hy> liberforce: correct it rebuilds
2011-10-25T10:35:41  <liberforce> So C is a bit disadvantaged here, as python and oters have linked lists and other stuff implementations out-of the box

2011-10-25T10:36:25  <f4hy> after one more update ill upload it again
2011-10-25T10:37:03  <f4hy> althought 3 days for feedback on a bot is pretty silly, the TCP servers are where it is at

2011-10-25T11:14:04  <cyphase> that would profile playgame.py
2011-10-25T11:14:37  <cyphase> you could pass python -m cProfile -o output_file YourBot.py as the command to run
2011-10-25T11:14:53  <Puj> It also records profiling for MyBot I believe.  At least some of the methods are included.  My bot doesn't not suck enough to confirm the method though.
2011-10-25T11:15:34  <cyphase> i'm not sure why it would. the bots are run as a subprocess, not by importing it as part of playgame.py

2011-10-25T12:28:16  <Alexer> amstan, wrt. the ants-tcp thread on the forums: i still think you should set up an official tcp server at some point and direct people to it :P
2011-10-25T12:28:32  <amstan> Alexer: we never had an official tcp server
2011-10-25T12:28:55  <Alexer> amstan, yes, but it'd be cool if you did
2011-10-25T12:29:14  <amstan> it's extra stuff we have to do, we'd rather work on making the next contest better, or fixing current issues with the current contest
2011-10-25T12:29:37  <amstan> every contest there was someone else with the tcp project, they usually handled it well
2011-10-25T12:30:28  <Alexer> amstan, well it's just that there are 3 tcp servers currently, and some people have mentioned wanting to host another one, and that's just dividing the player base
2011-10-25T12:30:40  <amstan> so what's the problem?
2011-10-25T12:30:41  <Alexer> it'd be nice if there was an official server to direct people to..
2011-10-25T12:31:00  <amstan> nobody says there shall only be one server
2011-10-25T12:31:04  <UncleVasya> amstan: Are there already some thoughts about next contest? Will it be zeta or another one-game? Will you think about it before this one ends or after that?
2011-10-25T12:31:26  <amstan> UncleVasya: the codebase is going to be called beta, we'll probably get django for the website
2011-10-25T12:31:33  <amstan> UncleVasya: we don't have a game for it yet though
2011-10-25T12:31:36  <amstan> zeta*

2011-10-25T12:33:02  <delt0r> but yea somewhere on the forums
2011-10-25T12:33:24  <delt0r> Or turn based "squad command"
2011-10-25T12:33:40  <delt0r> something like that i would put more time into
2011-10-25T12:33:42  <Alexer> amstan, but having more than one server does no good, it only makes it harder

2011-10-25T12:34:18  <delt0r> not a fan
2011-10-25T12:34:38  <delt0r> changeable terrian just complicated the bots without much gain IMHO
2011-10-25T12:34:47  <delt0r> complicates
2011-10-25T12:35:01  <Alexer> currently fluxids server seems to be the de facto server though. ashods server has no players and accouns server has maybe two or three, whereas fluxids server has more
2011-10-25T12:35:47  <amstan> Alexer: so get fluxid to post a topic on the forums, and i'll replace accoun's post
2011-10-25T12:36:05  <Fluxid> ...
2011-10-25T12:36:08  <delt0r> amstan: why replace... sounds like one more flame war
2011-10-25T12:36:17  <cyphase> all coordinates are 0-indexed (row,col), right?
2011-10-25T12:36:29  <delt0r> yep
2011-10-25T12:36:47  <amstan> delt0r: yeah, maybe
2011-10-25T12:36:58  <Alexer> delt0r, because Accouns post doesn't mention any server besides his own, which doesn't have enough players to play
2011-10-25T12:37:11  <Fluxid> amstan: post about what? tcp? and what should i tell?
2011-10-25T12:37:20  <delt0r> Alexer: So? just add a post...
2011-10-25T12:37:26  <delt0r> don't think replacing is a good idea
2011-10-25T12:37:31  <amstan> Fluxid: introduce your server, give a short tutorial on what to download and how you should start compeeting
2011-10-25T12:37:39  <amstan> Fluxid: maybe include a link to the server code
2011-10-25T12:37:49  <Alexer> delt0r, i asked Accoun to add the other servers to the first post, but he didn't. the servers are mentioned in the middle of the second page...
2011-10-25T12:37:50  <amstan> delt0r: posts get lost easily
2011-10-25T12:38:08  <amstan> delt0r: crucial info is usually on the first post
2011-10-25T12:38:21  <delt0r> Alexer: yea we know... there is history here, and it is likely to cause more issues that it will save
2011-10-25T12:38:22  <Fluxid> amstan: i'm hosting this server for testing purposes, to play with other bots before sending my bot to official server. it's not for competition.
2011-10-25T12:38:34  <Fluxid> if someone wants to compete on my server.. he got the wrong idea
2011-10-25T12:38:52  <delt0r> also dont think deleting/replacing posts in forums is a good idea generally
2011-10-25T12:38:56  <Alexer> Fluxid, no-ones saying it's for competition
2011-10-25T12:39:04  <Fluxid> and code is the same from github as in http://aichallenge.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1505
2011-10-25T12:39:30  <Alexer> Fluxid, i'm just saying yours is currently the only one you can test your bot on, since the others haven't got enough players

2011-10-25T12:49:59  <Alexer> amstan, since it takes a lot more time than what would be nice to test your bot on the normal official server, i think it would be beneficial to direct people to test their bots on a tcp server, since it's much faster
2011-10-25T12:51:02  <Alexer> amstan, currently people often come in here, say something like "next game in 200 minutes, for real??", and we direct them to test on the tcp servers

2011-10-25T12:53:37  <Alexer> amstan, so i guess my point is that if you had an official tcp server, you could tell people on the site to test on that if they can, since it's much faster

2011-10-25T13:00:46  <UncleVasya> I just say that low game rate is not a thing organisers must be blamed for.

2011-10-25T13:02:54  <aliceinwire> on doing things?
2011-10-25T13:03:01  <amstan> aliceinwire: it's not necessarly on language speed
2011-10-25T13:03:10  <amstan> aliceinwire: you might have a similar problem in C
2011-10-25T13:03:20  <Alexer> FLashM, http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto
2011-10-25T13:03:33  <amstan> aliceinwire: you need to figure out how to do your algorithms to be faster
2011-10-25T13:03:33  <FLashM> Thanks a lot
2011-10-25T13:03:38  <UncleVasya> Alexer:  ah, I haven't saw your very first message. I apologize.
2011-10-25T13:03:45  <amstan> aliceinwire: or if you're doing searching, don't do it for all ants for long paths
2011-10-25T13:03:52  <Alexer> UncleVasya, no problem :)

2011-10-25T13:06:10  <Alexer> Fluxid, how much time it took you to set up the tcp server?
2011-10-25T13:06:19  <Fluxid> Alexer: five minutes
2011-10-25T13:06:24  <Fluxid> if not less
2011-10-25T13:06:56  <Fluxid> nginx vhost with proxy, start one process, edit one file, start second process, done
2011-10-25T13:07:26  <Alexer> amstan, so sure, it'd be extra stuff, but apparently it wouldn't take long, at least :P

2011-10-25T13:15:46  <cyphase> lavalamp, maybe you're giving it more processing power than the server
2011-10-25T13:16:23  <lavalamp> It's running in a VM with limited RAM on my home computer, so it's possible but it seems unlikely.

2011-10-25T13:17:47  <UncleVasya> lavalamp: maybe you test only on several maps and the bug in your code doesn't do it's job on them. Try to test bot on many maps and launch it against himself on all of them.

2011-10-25T15:55:13  <_flag> Okay, thanks
2011-10-25T15:55:14  <McLeopold> so, the cutoff turn amount should be about the same as max hill distance
2011-10-25T15:55:34  <_flag> From watching it I assume it takes into account the number of ants my opponent has left, correct?
2011-10-25T15:55:35  <avdg> (meh, I wonder myself what the code looks like for that specific part)
2011-10-25T15:55:42  <McLeopold> which starts its count when you have 90% of the ants

2011-10-25T15:59:20  <janzert> I think that game is a legitimate cutoff though
2011-10-25T15:59:53  <janzert> by the time you had 90% of the ants you should have been able to get too his hill too, right?
2011-10-25T16:00:38  <_flag> I definately could have won that, but my bot would have to recognize that I have an insurmountable lead and rush his hill
2011-10-25T16:01:05  <_flag> I'm not saying I can't do that, I'm just not sure if it should be a requirement for a bot not to be cutoff
2011-10-25T16:01:14  <janzert> you locate his hill around turn 500 and have another 500 turns to mount some sort of offense though
2011-10-25T16:01:41  <_flag> Correct but I also want to gain control of the map so he doesn't take all the food
2011-10-25T16:02:10  <_flag> And due to the low rate of food spawn I only have full control over the map at around turn ~900

I killed 3 of the 4 others and then my bot crashed.
2011-10-25T17:15:34  <SharkMonkey> Can the color of your own bot be changed for replays? If you view a replay with user=id in the url your own bot is rather hard to see.

2011-10-25T17:29:53  <SharkMonkey> Diede, You might just have to keep running simulations until it happens locally :)
2011-10-25T17:30:24  <SharkMonkey> Or look at the state when the bot crashed online, and reason out what might have happened.
2011-10-25T17:30:46  <Diede> Am I allowed to write debug info from the bot to a server ? (I guess not, but I wanna try)
2011-10-25T17:30:53  <avdg> and if you want to have debug messages, just use process.stderr.write ;-)
2011-10-25T17:30:57  <SharkMonkey> Diede, My bot used to crash only when playing weaker opponents. I had a ton of ants.

2011-10-25T17:40:16  <Alexer> Guest70576, you can change it
2011-10-25T17:40:52  <Guest70576> alright, thanks
2011-10-25T17:40:52  <avdg> well, depends on which ants.py
2011-10-25T17:41:09  <Alexer> Guest70576, the server just communicates through stdin/stdout to your bot
2011-10-25T17:41:12  <avdg> (there is a server side script called ants.py as well :p)
2011-10-25T17:41:42  <Alexer> Guest70576, so you can change it as long as you keep reading the correct data in and outputing the correct data :P
2011-10-25T17:41:49  <SharkMonkey> avdg, Be careful confusing new comers :)
2011-10-25T17:41:51  <Guest70576> well i mean the one in the starter package, where it stores your ants and stuff ;)

2011-10-25T17:57:11  <SharkMonkey> *In past contests
2011-10-25T17:57:50  <SharkMonkey> Like ebay sniping. People don't place their highest bids until the last minute.
2011-10-25T17:58:11  <analyst74> you could risk with a buggy bot
2011-10-25T17:58:24  <Zannick> i don't think that happens a lot because unless you submit or use the tcp servers you don't know how well it actually performs

2011-10-25T18:02:27  <cyphase> it just seems from what i read that the amount of games run for the final competition would make it prohibitive for 2000+ bots
2011-10-25T18:02:33  <cyphase> maybe i got the wrong impression
2011-10-25T18:03:44  <analyst74> assuming 20 player/min, each player playing 10 games (20000), that's 1000 minutes

2011-10-25T18:19:23  <Islacrusez> anyone present that is proficient with python2?
2011-10-25T18:19:36  <cyphase> Islacrusez, what's up?
2011-10-25T18:20:23  <Islacrusez> I'm trying to go through the tutorial, but the second page (about finding food) isn't very specific about where to insert/replace code
2011-10-25T18:20:37  <cyphase> let's see..
2011-10-25T18:20:40  <Islacrusez> I've tried it a few ways and it either crashes or doesn't move
2011-10-25T18:21:34  <Islacrusez> ( http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial_step_2.php )
2011-10-25T18:21:37  <cyphase> Islacrusez, the first chunk of code says "Create the following function after the do_move_direction function"
2011-10-25T18:21:57  <cyphase> Islacrusez, and the second chunk says "Now replace the default move with this:"
2011-10-25T18:22:08  <Islacrusez> yeah
2011-10-25T18:22:12  <Islacrusez> the first bit I think I managed

2011-10-25T18:24:18  <cyphase> Islacrusez, still not working?
2011-10-25T18:25:05  <Islacrusez> well I inserted the first bit of code and it didn't crash
2011-10-25T18:25:13  <Islacrusez> now lemme try the second bit, since that sounds really vague
2011-10-25T18:26:03  <cyphase> the default move you're replacing should have "# default move" above it
2011-10-25T18:27:21  <McLeopold> http://paste.aichallenge.org/jEZT2/ :D
2011-10-25T18:27:26  <Islacrusez> that entire chunk of code between # default move and the whitespace?
2011-10-25T18:28:17  <McLeopold> Islacrusez: pastebin your code
2011-10-25T18:28:26  <cyphase> Islacrusez, yea, that sounds right
2011-10-25T18:28:33  <cyphase> that loop
2011-10-25T18:28:36  <f4hy> I finally updated my code to have defense, still getting rocked by locutus
2011-10-25T18:28:43  <f4hy> I guess I need offense
2011-10-25T18:28:57  <cyphase> ant your posts! fiight!
2011-10-25T18:29:15  <Islacrusez> ok, did that and it didn't crash but it did nothing at all
2011-10-25T18:29:21  <Islacrusez> so I must have the first bit wrong?

2011-10-25T18:36:19  <McLeopold> Islacrusez: you just need to indent the do_move_location
2011-10-25T18:36:29  <McLeopold> what you did was end the function above
2011-10-25T18:37:30  <Islacrusez> but that's the indentation the tutorial gives you :S
2011-10-25T18:37:49  <Puj> Why would turning psyco off decrease the occurence of unpredictable timeouts?
2011-10-25T18:38:31  <Zannick> do *you* know how psyco works?
2011-10-25T18:38:35  <Puj> No
2011-10-25T18:38:46  <Puj> Does it precompile to c?
2011-10-25T18:38:49  <Zannick> then if you turn it off, all timeouts become more predictable :P
2011-10-25T18:39:01  <Puj> Good point, +t

2011-10-25T19:59:39  <tassadar> hey everyone, is there a way to check runtime of official games?
2011-10-25T20:00:52  <bumbleHEDGE> I'm not sure, when I try to log in it thinks I spelled my username or password incorrectly but I've typed it correctly and even a couple variations in case I typed it wrong twice is there a way to confirm my password?
2011-10-25T20:01:14  <bumbleHEDGE> also when I try to search for my name in the user search it doesn't find my name, is that normal?
2011-10-25T20:01:19  <Israfel> Send the password/reset it.
2011-10-25T20:01:39  <bumbleHEDGE> how do I do that?
2011-10-25T20:02:36  <Israfel> hmm, don't see the option. Try making another account.
2011-10-25T20:03:01  <bumbleHEDGE> I did, but it says I'm only allowed to have one and that I'll be disqualified if I try to make another
2011-10-25T20:03:17  <staalebk> Hmm, my bot timed out, while it runs fast on my computer... are there any known problems with the java compiler in use?
2011-10-25T20:03:22  <cyphase> aaah
2011-10-25T20:03:56  <cyphase> i was assuming there was a blank line between the data for every turn, as in the spec

2011-10-25T20:06:27  <tassadar> wow, is turntime really .5 secs on official server? kinda low
2011-10-25T20:07:59  <staalebk> 0.5 secs should still be plenty of time for my bot.. it goes trough 200 turns in not many seconds.
2011-10-25T20:08:06  <staalebk> But it still timed out on the very first move
2011-10-25T20:08:35  <tassadar> well, the default config in playgame is 1000 ms, so was assuming that
2011-10-25T20:08:56  <amstan> tassadar: gpm would go half if turn time was bigger
2011-10-25T20:09:03  <staalebk> even with 50ms i still manage around 60 turns before I get enough ants to timeout on my computer...
2011-10-25T20:09:22  <staalebk> so I'm guessing something is taking way more time with the java compiler they use
2011-10-25T20:09:50  <tassadar> well, when i submitted first vers, i got timeout first turn too.
2011-10-25T20:09:59  <tassadar> then realized i was doing way too much precalculation

2011-10-25T20:10:40  <staalebk> ah, maybe test with that version and see if I can reproduce the slowness
2011-10-25T20:10:52  <tassadar> idk why they don't just use standard sun java :P

2011-10-25T20:32:07  <grom358> yeah but why are they sorting the tiles ??
2011-10-25T20:32:13  <Puj> I suppose, maybe you are gettign the closest food?
2011-10-25T20:32:26  <Puj> As sortedFood.first()
2011-10-25T20:32:38  <grom358> nah they just loop over the all
2011-10-25T20:32:57  <Puj> ?
2011-10-25T20:33:03  <grom358> they get the distance between the food and ants and store the routes and sort the routes
2011-10-25T20:33:12  <grom358> so the sort on the food and ants seems pointless to me
2011-10-25T20:34:13  <Puj> Dunno, maybe they are trying to match closest food-ant pairs and give you those routes

2011-10-25T21:13:56  <Craklyn> It's not timing out because you have more ants and more food on the screen, so more things to search?
2011-10-25T21:14:20  <burny> and food durther away
2011-10-25T21:14:25  <burny> and impossible to get to?
2011-10-25T21:14:41  <grom358> no I'm testing on the tutorial map. only have couple of ants
2011-10-25T21:15:48  <burny> by impossible to get to, I mean.. that you can't see a path to it, but can see the food?
2011-10-25T21:16:02  <Craklyn> Does each turn take progressively longer until eventually you overuse  your time?  Or is it low, low, low, low, timeout?

2011-10-25T21:28:51  <burny> what exactly does the 'skill' mean, in the rankings?
2011-10-25T21:29:15  <amstan> burny: the trueskill score thing
2011-10-25T21:29:16  <jbroman> burny: I believe it's your TrueSkill score.
2011-10-25T21:29:26  <burny> which is?
2011-10-25T21:29:34  <jbroman> burny: A number between 0 and 100.
2011-10-25T21:30:17  <jbroman> To be less snarky, it's an estimate of how "good" a player is using the TrueSkill algorithm.
2011-10-25T21:30:21  <jbroman> http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/faq.aspx
2011-10-25T21:30:32  <jbroman> It doesn't mean "percentage of games you've won" or anything so intuitive
2011-10-25T21:30:34  <cyphase> eww, microsoft

2011-10-25T21:32:01  <cyphase> whodu thunk
2011-10-25T21:38:19  <burny> erm.. so it's basically similar to ELO, except, it's auto normalized to a 1-100 range, so it has no meangful value, or 'unit'?

2011-10-25T21:39:48  <bobbydroptable> in ELO i think you lose points for games lost, and gain points for games won
2011-10-25T21:40:03  <bobbydroptable> in trueskill, you don't lose points if you lose to another player who was obviously better than you
2011-10-25T21:40:08  <jbroman> I don't know the details of Elo, but with TrueSkill, Each player has a pair (mu, sigma) which represent's the player's average skill (mu) and the deviation in that (sigma).
2011-10-25T21:40:21  <bobbydroptable> but you lose points if you lost to someone who you should have beaten

2011-10-25T21:40:43  <jbroman> You can read the documentaiton on TrueSkill, but basically as its expectations about how well you will do are confirmed, mu goes to your "actual skill" and sigma goes to zero.

2011-10-25T21:49:47  <bobbydroptable> i've been thinking about it for 2 days and i've thought about waypointing (but i have no idea how to decide the best place to waypoint)
2011-10-25T21:50:10  <bobbydroptable> and i've looked into navigation meshes (but i can't decide how to set the regions especially with an unknown map)
2011-10-25T21:50:19  <burny> bobby.. use probability, and determine which path, is going to generate the best proability of finding food
2011-10-25T21:50:48  <burny> taking into account how likely you are to get food, how long it will take to get the food, how likely you are to die before you get it, etc.
2011-10-25T21:50:57  <bobbydroptable> canadian traveller: that's exactly the problem ==" looking into it
2011-10-25T21:51:23  <bobbydroptable> burny that's alot of things to take into account =="
2011-10-25T21:51:41  <burny> yup :)
2011-10-25T21:53:28  <bobbydroptable> :(
2011-10-25T21:53:56  <burny> I have a concern about the scoring system, any admins who are familiar with how exactly it works, care to discuss in /msg?
2011-10-25T21:54:40  <amstan> burny: sure?
2011-10-25T21:55:27  <Draivin> how big normally is the delay between your turn end to your next turn start?
2011-10-25T21:55:37  <bmh> bobbydroptable: This problem actually appears to be a hellish variant of the CTP -- multi-agent CTP
2011-10-25T21:56:00  <bobbydroptable> it doesn't have to be though
2011-10-25T21:56:03  <bobbydroptable> i think
2011-10-25T21:56:30  <bobbydroptable> what i've been trying to do is to build a graph across the entire map so that i don't need to tell my ants where to go, they decide based on weights on the nodes
2011-10-25T21:56:48  <bobbydroptable> but I can't do even distribution of nodes because there will be areas where the nodes fall on water blocks
2011-10-25T21:56:57  <bobbydroptable> and i can't figure out how to build the graph dynamically as I traverse the environment
2011-10-25T21:57:43  <bobbydroptable> so its not a multi-agent CTP in that there is only 1 graph I am building. this abstracts away the direction decision making from the ant agents
2011-10-25T21:57:57  <bobbydroptable> and from the sounds of it, this hasn't been solved yet?
2011-10-25T21:58:12  <bobbydroptable> at least, still NP problem?
2011-10-25T21:59:05  <Draivin> you could create repulsion and attraction points in the map, that modify the A* weight it puts on a movement depending on your distance to these points
2011-10-25T21:59:18  <Draivin> so that ants naturally will take paths that go through the attraction points
2011-10-25T21:59:23  <Draivin> and avoid the repulsion points
2011-10-25T21:59:56  <bobbydroptable> Draivin that's a fine idea
2011-10-25T22:00:02  <bobbydroptable> but where do i put the points?
2011-10-25T22:00:15  <bobbydroptable> how do i decide the best place to put the point
2011-10-25T22:00:48  <Draivin> they could be dinamic, put attraction points in enemy hills, and adjust the repulsion points based on the number of enemy ants in an area
2011-10-25T22:00:49  <bobbydroptable> that's essentially the problem i am having :)
2011-10-25T22:01:07  <bobbydroptable> but at the beginning none of these things are in play
2011-10-25T22:01:15  <bobbydroptable> there may be a few food around
2011-10-25T22:01:28  <bobbydroptable> but if there's no food around there would be no goal
2011-10-25T22:01:44  <Draivin> you could assign a task to a ant
2011-10-25T22:01:50  <Draivin> like when there is a unclaimed food
2011-10-25T22:01:55  <Draivin> you find the nearest and
2011-10-25T22:01:55  <Fluxid> bah, making food collection maximally efficient is hard

2011-10-25T22:05:31  <Draivin> besides

2011-10-25T22:12:42  <Draivin> just food for thought, but you could also implement a multi-tier A*, at the most basic level it treats larger squares of land as one tile
2011-10-25T22:12:45  <Draivin> and the closer you get
2011-10-25T22:12:52  <Draivin> the more detailed the pathfinding gets

2011-10-25T22:14:48  <Draivin> more thoughts, you could implement a 'squad' as you get more ants, and treat each squad as a single entity, the ants will stick to the squad, and you could do a single pathfinding for a whole squad

2011-10-25T22:25:01  <bobbydroptable> too much overhead with recursion

2011-10-25T22:25:11  <bmh> (iteration is recursion.)
2011-10-25T22:25:30  <amstan> depends on your stack

2011-10-25T22:25:45  <bobbydroptable> my thinking is... build different components of what i need.

2011-10-25T22:28:17  <bobbydroptable> i think what i will do is to do a BFS in all 4 directions, see which one gets me the furthest.
2011-10-25T22:28:24  <bobbydroptable> then place a node there.
2011-10-25T22:28:26  <avdg> is 4 enough?

2011-10-25T22:30:57  <antimatroid> a1k0n: thinking about that "tracking down enemies" idea, i think it might just be alright to keep information at each land location out of sight for the soonest an enemy you previously saw could have reached that location
2011-10-25T22:31:39  <antimatroid> the only difference really from doing it probabilistically i think is that it'd weight locations with more access more?
2011-10-25T22:31:56  <Larose> That's a method to assign a score to each square and your ants move by choosing the highest square/score next to them

2011-10-25T22:39:20  <antimatroid> plus i'd been curious a couple of times, but i don't mind that much atm
2011-10-25T22:39:23  <Larose> Craklyn: I'm interested :)
2011-10-25T22:39:53  <Craklyn> I made a 2d array of integers which corresponds to the map.  Each integer begins at -1.
2011-10-25T22:40:12  <Craklyn> Each turn, the map space which corresponds to the square the ants are standing on, I set the value to the current turn
2011-10-25T22:40:14  <bmh> Should I expect the time per turn to vary?
2011-10-25T22:40:45  <Craklyn> For all the squares the ants can see, I set the value to MAX(tile's current value, turnNumber - distance2(ant, tile))
2011-10-25T22:41:02  <Larose> bmh: Well, because food attracks my ant, they always hit a wall..

2011-10-25T22:41:36  <Craklyn> The ant then simply walks downhill..

2011-10-25T22:45:17  <Craklyn> If you think about the way this algorithm works, I am basically building a hill around all the ants
2011-10-25T22:45:18  <Larose> For the moment, water repulses and food attracts (according to the manhattan distance)
2011-10-25T22:45:32  <Craklyn> And then requiring the ants fall down hill continuously
2011-10-25T22:45:52  <Craklyn> MAX ensures that I don't dig a hole for the ant to trap itself into..
2011-10-25T22:46:34  <Craklyn> I'm not sure if the figurative language is helpful or not :P
2011-10-25T22:46:46  <Darrow> I was considering using a heavily weighted A* algorithm, I think the distances are short enough that it doesn't matter if isn't a completely optimal shortest distance.
2011-10-25T22:46:48  <Larose> I think I get it
2011-10-25T22:47:00  <Larose> It's to prevent to get stuck in a local minima?
2011-10-25T22:47:02  <grom358> this is driving me nuts... doing the pathfinding is so hard
2011-10-25T22:47:40  <grom358> my nice A* can't handle the big maps.. status timeouts :(
2011-10-25T22:47:42  <Craklyn> It's to prevent the code from making the field a minimum at a place you recently measured well
2011-10-25T22:47:52  <avdg> doing it all together at once is hard ;-)
2011-10-25T22:48:31  <Craklyn> I increase the map's potential for places I know well.  The center of an ant gets a value of (current turn).  As you get further from an ant, the value goes up to (current turn - distance2)
2011-10-25T22:49:09  <Craklyn> However, if you measured it very very well two turns ago, you "want" the value to be (current turn - 2).  If you didn't have the max, it'd be downgraded to (current turn - 4).
2011-10-25T22:49:44  <bmh> grom358: are you pathfinding at every turn?
2011-10-25T22:49:56  <Craklyn> It's an ad-hoc solution.  I'm not saying it's the proper way to weight it :P   I was hoping to discuss it because maybe I'm doing something dumb..
2011-10-25T22:51:35  <Larose> Craklyn: Maybe I didn't read the same papers as you did, but I can't figure out how you compute the attractive/repulsion of the water/food/ants/hill
2011-10-25T22:52:00  <Craklyn> This is a purely "explorer" ant.  He's only interested in revealing new territory
2011-10-25T22:52:09  <Larose> Oh, ok
2011-10-25T22:52:10  <Craklyn> I'm making different discrete ant goals right now
2011-10-25T22:52:28  <Craklyn> Later, I can just sum potentials to get a superpotential :)
2011-10-25T22:52:56  <bmh> grom358: if you're timing out I would suggest doing this: Keep a queue of ants and their marching orders, sorted by age
2011-10-25T22:53:07  <Craklyn> I didn't read any papers on this subject.  Is this the general way a person does a "potential field" in AI?
2011-10-25T22:53:11  <bmh> grom358: Then do path-finding for the unordered ants until you run out of time
2011-10-25T22:53:42  <grom358> bmh: yeah I do it everytime.. yeah I'll have todo a queue
2011-10-25T22:53:55  <Larose> That's a good idea, maybe I can use potential field only for my ants explorer

2011-10-25T22:58:20  <Larose> Right now, my ants get often stuck in local minima (using manhattan distance for food/water). So i though that I could do a BFS from the food with a depth limit for the attraction. But this doesn't seem efficient
2011-10-25T23:00:58  <Craklyn> Larose: That's what I currently do for my "eater" ants.  I do a single BFS from all foods on the map up to the max distance any ant can see.  I then have all my eater ants walk downhill toward their nearest food.  It's super quick to calculate, but the downside is that I sometimes get multiple ants going toward the same food.

2011-10-25T23:35:05  <Craklyn> When you draw the areas an ant can attack, it either makes a point or it makes a flat surface...
2011-10-25T23:35:10  <bobbydroptable> there will be exchanges there i think
2011-10-25T23:35:27  <Craklyn> So the range affects whether you will exchange at the choke or whether one side will purely lose
2011-10-25T23:35:34  <bobbydroptable> i got to read the battle mechanics again
2011-10-25T23:35:34  <Exception> yes
2011-10-25T23:35:47  <Exception> hmm
2011-10-25T23:35:51  <Craklyn> E.g. attackRange2 = 9 versus attackRange2 = 8

2011-10-25T23:48:26  <burny> is it against the rules to use the RF noise of the cpu, to send signals to a remote host, and use an external gamma ray laser, to twiddle bits in memory?
