2012-05-02T12:03:35  <mcstar> HaraKiri: hi
2012-05-02T12:09:17  <HaraKiri> hi!
2012-05-02T12:11:53  <mcstar> how do you feel about ml class?
2012-05-02T12:11:58  <mcstar> and octave?
2012-05-02T12:12:18  <mcstar> i did yesterday week3 assignments
2012-05-02T12:12:42  <HaraKiri> i thought you didn't want to
2012-05-02T12:13:12  <mcstar> i want to do the class :)
2012-05-02T12:13:14  <mcstar> i have to
2012-05-02T12:13:26  <HaraKiri> :D
2012-05-02T12:13:41  <mcstar> honestly, octave turned out quite simple
2012-05-02T12:13:55  <mcstar> the answers are usually 1 liners in vectorized form
2012-05-02T12:14:00  <mcstar> so it isnt a big trouble
2012-05-02T12:14:05  <HaraKiri> yeah it's really just another language
2012-05-02T12:14:18  <mcstar> (in the beginning i thought you would have to actually program something)
2012-05-02T12:14:42  <HaraKiri> i've rushed through the videos and review questions too fast, so i slowed down my pace. in the programming i'm only halfway through the first assignment
2012-05-02T12:15:16  <mcstar> i have linalg background, and did a lot of fitting in my youth
2012-05-02T12:15:26  <HaraKiri> sounds like a fun youth
2012-05-02T12:15:29  <mcstar> and had a numerical methods class too
2012-05-02T12:15:55  <mcstar> (im not that old, just like to speak that way :D)
2012-05-02T12:16:05  <HaraKiri> you should lead with something else when you talk to the ladies ;)
2012-05-02T12:16:47  <HaraKiri> i'm surprised there is no final exam. makes it feel kinda worthless
2012-05-02T12:16:56  <mcstar> there isnt?
2012-05-02T12:17:31  <HaraKiri> no. just the regular questions and programmig exams until the end. both of which can be tried infinite times until full points
2012-05-02T12:17:39  <mcstar> in the end of week3 Ng says 'now you probably know more than most of silicon valley about machine learning'
2012-05-02T12:18:05  <HaraKiri> cool
2012-05-02T12:18:15  <HaraKiri> i'd like to have a beer with ng. might be a cool dude
2012-05-02T12:18:28  <mcstar> ah, i bet he is exaggerating, to up our mood
2012-05-02T12:19:05  <mcstar> i fear that after a couple of beers, we wouldnt understand his engrish
2012-05-02T12:19:21  <HaraKiri> maybe. but he'll get wild
2012-05-02T12:19:26  <HaraKiri> dancing and stuff
2012-05-02T12:19:47  <mcstar> XD
2012-05-02T12:22:28  <mcstar> HaraKiri: the submitting method is pretty neat
2012-05-02T12:22:46  <mcstar> and the way they made the programming assignments
2012-05-02T12:24:19  <HaraKiri> hmm yeah kinda. worked for me so far
2012-05-02T12:24:50  <HaraKiri> on an unrelated note: are you / anyone else here doing the google code jam?
2012-05-02T12:26:37  <mcstar> probably, but not me
2012-05-02T12:26:59  <mcstar> i think flagcapper is
2012-05-02T12:27:17  <mcstar> maybe rwest
2012-05-02T12:27:22  <HaraKiri> okok
2012-05-02T12:36:27  <mcstar> HaraKiri: i think contestbot was down when that conversation took place about google code jam
2012-05-02T12:36:33  <mcstar> cause i cant find it in the logs

2012-05-02T13:55:42  <JamesMG_> that might be what I was thinking of, I was just remembering from a few years back
2012-05-02T13:56:32  <JamesMG_> yeah that's it, this is the line I was remembering: "i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck?"
2012-05-02T13:57:18  <mcstar> he didnt come up with it

2012-05-02T14:58:33  <mcstar> antimatroid: why?
2012-05-02T14:58:47  <antimatroid> getting to run in the warm rain :P
2012-05-02T14:59:01  <mcstar> 'fuck you' was a bit strong
2012-05-02T14:59:11  <antimatroid> you don't know us australians well enough :P
2012-05-02T14:59:22  <mcstar> getting there apparently
2012-05-02T14:59:43  <antimatroid> people aren't kidding when they say we call our friends cunts
2012-05-02T15:03:36  <pairofdice> O_o
2012-05-02T15:05:34  <mcstar> 'bazdmeg' == you fuck it, is the most common repetative word in a conversation among friends
2012-05-02T15:06:03  <mcstar> but in writing, it becomes different
2012-05-02T15:06:19  <mcstar> at least for me, 'fuck you' in writing is too strong
2012-05-02T15:06:28  <mcstar> just an opinion
