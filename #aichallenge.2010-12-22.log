2010-12-22T00:42:18  <Frontier> antimatroid1: I see two reasons why centering the maps is bad. It is harder to debug them then and in some cases the ants don't take the shortest route to attack each others base so the desired effect of centering on the action is void.

2010-12-22T05:13:09  <Epona> kind of like
2010-12-22T05:13:14  <Epona> whatever the output is
2010-12-22T05:13:26  <Epona> is what a variable of the summation equation will be
2010-12-22T05:13:44  <sigh> ah, i see what you mean
2010-12-22T05:14:02  <sigh> I suggest starting with something simpler, like one input box and one output

2010-12-22T05:14:51  <Epona> its really cool that theyve added new stuf to python 3.1.3

2010-12-22T06:47:52  <Epona> o
2010-12-22T06:48:18  <Epona> Idk. I like building algorithms. just thought it would make it easier
2010-12-22T06:54:29  <antimatroid1> what are you trying to do?
2010-12-22T06:54:35  <antimatroid1> build up a way of representing functions?

2010-12-22T06:58:41  <delt0r_> AoI comes to mind
2010-12-22T06:59:03  <Epona> could you show me?
2010-12-22T06:59:12  <delt0r_> can do the procedural textures without a keyboard (more or less)
2010-12-22T06:59:18  <delt0r_> Art of Illusion

2010-12-22T07:01:17  <Epona> idk if this is what im looking for

2010-12-22T07:05:12  <delt0r_> its pretty similar
2010-12-22T07:06:53  <Epona> so um
2010-12-22T07:07:01  <Epona> wheres the part the involves algorithms
2010-12-22T07:07:10  <Epona> this just looks like a 3d image editor

2010-12-22T07:08:37  <delt0r_> Epona: add a texture --or a new texture and do the "procedural" one
2010-12-22T07:08:44  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: me too
2010-12-22T07:08:54  <delt0r_> after a cycle or a run.
2010-12-22T07:09:54  <antimatroid1> i can't get down with running, it's too much effort
2010-12-22T07:10:08  <antimatroid1> i got a bike halfway through the year which i use most of the time rather than my car now though
2010-12-22T07:10:12  <antimatroid1> and play (field) hockey
2010-12-22T07:10:23  <antimatroid1> so i get some time outside not sitting at a computer

2010-12-22T07:40:08  <antimatroid1> i don't like matlab
2010-12-22T07:40:18  <antimatroid1> it's like doing all the programming without doing any of the thinking
2010-12-22T07:41:00  <sigh> programming in matlab sucks
2010-12-22T07:41:14  <Epona> sooo. its not that well written
2010-12-22T07:41:18  <sigh> but it is pretty awesome for dealing with anything that involves matricies
2010-12-22T07:41:38  <antimatroid1> matrices are easy to deal with
2010-12-22T07:41:45  <antimatroid1> solving odes etc. and i would probably use it
2010-12-22T07:42:11  <antimatroid1> i got bored earlier in the year and wrote up gauss siedel in c++, they're usually fairly straight forward
2010-12-22T07:42:37  <antimatroid1> <3 wolfram alpha for my calculus of variations assignments, i hate solving messy des
2010-12-22T07:42:58  <Epona> walfram alpha is <3
2010-12-22T07:43:08  <Epona> thats what inspired me a lot
2010-12-22T07:43:30  <antimatroid1> my opinion is entirely based off the internets opinion, but wolfram seems like a real dick
2010-12-22T07:43:33  <delt0r_> try mathematica..
2010-12-22T07:43:44  <delt0r_> its good
2010-12-22T07:43:44  <antimatroid1> ^^ same person
2010-12-22T07:43:54  <delt0r_> R is free
2010-12-22T07:44:09  <antimatroid1> yeah, i've never really used R
2010-12-22T07:44:13  <antimatroid1> i use GAUSS for work
2010-12-22T07:44:35  <antimatroid1> although mostly just playing around with programs the person i ra for has
2010-12-22T07:44:40  <delt0r_> but a gui just can't easily capture the complexites of real work... there is a reason why RAD gui tools are not even popular for RAD devlopment
2010-12-22T07:44:50  <antimatroid1> i think she might let me just do stuff for her in c++ now though
2010-12-22T07:45:14  <delt0r_> GAUSS is for proofs and stuff IIRC ie combinatorial work yea?
2010-12-22T07:45:23  <antimatroid1> she does stats stuff with it
2010-12-22T07:45:36  <antimatroid1> she works with fairly large data sets doing macroeconomics
2010-12-22T07:45:56  <antimatroid1> good for working with matrices
2010-12-22T07:46:06  <antimatroid1> but it isn't as flexible as c++
2010-12-22T07:46:14  <sigh> hmm... haven't heard of GAUSS before
2010-12-22T07:46:23  <sigh> doesn't the guy have enough things named after him without having a software package too?

2010-12-22T07:52:39  <antimatroid1> no :P
2010-12-22T07:53:04  <antimatroid1> our numerics class was with engineers, so it was a little too easy
2010-12-22T07:53:05  <delt0r_> Its easy to do with diagonal systems... ie Poisson PDE
2010-12-22T07:53:07  <delt0r_> or CFD
2010-12-22T07:54:09  <antimatroid1> i don't really understand pde's very well
2010-12-22T07:54:39  <antimatroid1> our class really could have been given under the physics department as an applied computation class, not much was explained theory wise, which i need to understand something
2010-12-22T07:55:07  <antimatroid1> i don't do well by learning the steps to solve something rather than why those steps solve it
2010-12-22T07:55:22  <sigh> it's magic!
2010-12-22T07:55:46  <antimatroid1> the best kind of magic is that where its still awesome once explained
2010-12-22T07:55:51  <antimatroid1> it's*

2010-12-22T21:45:24  <dmj111> if you have "\n"s without \r's in a string, many windows programs don't show the new line at all.  not sure if that is what you are seeing.  ( and yes, ideally it should work anywhere :) )
2010-12-22T21:49:42  <antimatroid1> i see the new lines when outputting, but maybe the process isn't collecting them right
2010-12-22T21:49:47  <antimatroid1> i'll play around later, cheers
2010-12-22T21:53:27  <dmj111> ok.  have fun.  if you have the code posted anywhere already, let me know and I will take a look.
