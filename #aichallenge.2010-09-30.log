2010-09-30T00:46:29  <sigh> |:
2010-09-30T00:46:29  <Sylph> no idea, i wish i can fix my bot compiling error
2010-09-30T00:46:35  <Sylph> compiled at home fine.... >.>
2010-09-30T00:46:39  <Zannick> admins are silent in general
2010-09-30T00:50:28  <Sylph> wow nice... I submitted the C# starter package and it goes 'error while compiling' >.>
2010-09-30T00:51:22  <sigh> isn't half the technical issues forum already dedicated to C#? :P
2010-09-30T00:54:59  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T00:55:02  <Sylph> I just replaced like 30 automatically implemented properties
2010-09-30T00:55:07  <Sylph> let's hope it works now -_-
2010-09-30T00:55:24  <Sylph> C# at 4.0 and they still use ISO 2 2.0 >.>
2010-09-30T00:56:03  <sigh> meh, their backend is *written* in python and they don't support the latest versions
2010-09-30T00:56:04  <Sylph> yay no compilation error :D
2010-09-30T00:56:06  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T00:56:08  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-30T00:56:09  <Sylph> I noticed
2010-09-30T00:56:09  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T00:56:19  <Sylph> python 2.5 now and python is at 2.7 stable and 3.1.2
2010-09-30T00:56:19  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T00:56:36  <sigh> that's a bigger fail, imo
2010-09-30T00:56:38  <Sylph> Was why I was so tempted to use ruby just because it get all the shinies
2010-09-30T00:56:45  <Sylph> not sure, seems about the same
2010-09-30T00:56:54  <Sylph> C# 2 to 4 is huge change too, but i guess you're right
2010-09-30T00:57:00  <Sylph> if considering them using python backend >.>
2010-09-30T00:57:08  <sigh> yeah, that's what I meant
2010-09-30T00:57:24  <Sylph> LOL I lost my first 3 fights :D
2010-09-30T00:57:27  <Sylph> coz my bot don't do anything yet
2010-09-30T00:57:56  <sigh> yup, that's a sure way to lose... unless you are playing ragebot
2010-09-30T00:58:03  <Sylph> though I think I got a turn 1 timeout too :|
2010-09-30T00:58:14  <Sylph> even playing ragebot you'll lose doing nothign at all . :p

2010-09-30T02:06:45  <sigh> my guess is that their server's package management only has python 2.5

2010-09-30T02:17:57  <sigh> yeah, but 1) it won't be as good as a library, 2) but higher investment just to try something that might now work
2010-09-30T02:18:00  <Sylph> It's nice that they try that, but its kinda harder to understand why not use the latest versions :/

2010-09-30T02:18:20  <sigh> heh
2010-09-30T02:18:23  <antimatroid> ie. if it spits out send 2.5 from planet i to j, and 3.5 from i to k, then others might go there, so you have a feasible solution for non-integers, but there might not exists a feasible integer solution
2010-09-30T02:18:36  <Sylph> about them supporting multiple languages.
2010-09-30T02:18:56  <sigh> antimatroid: oh totallt agree with that, being one ship off is no problem as long as you fail in the right direction
2010-09-30T02:19:08  <antimatroid> yep, but is it possible to ensure that?
2010-09-30T02:19:17  <antimatroid> and still find feasible solutions when they exist
2010-09-30T02:20:05  <sigh> eh? you can check the orders genereated and add a ship where required
2010-09-30T02:20:23  <antimatroid> say what?
2010-09-30T02:21:11  <sigh> if you want to send 2.5 from i to j and 3.5 from i to k, just send 3 fro i to j and 4 from i to k
2010-09-30T02:21:29  <sigh> if you have a problem with lack of ships, then under-report available ships to the LP

2010-09-30T02:54:55  <antimatroid1> Sylph: why not c++?
2010-09-30T02:55:11  <Sylph> It might take more time for me to write in c++ :/

2010-09-30T02:55:27  <antimatroid1> it's really not much different to java, except things are more consistent and it just lets you do whatever you want
2010-09-30T02:55:35  <Sylph> I guess that's true
2010-09-30T02:55:35  <antimatroid1> except overload operator precedence godamnit!
2010-09-30T02:55:38  <Sylph> and it is faster
2010-09-30T02:56:01  <Sylph> Since I'm rewriting from 'scratch', that might even be a good idea
2010-09-30T02:56:02  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-30T02:56:05  <sigh> just use whichever you are most comfortable with

2010-09-30T02:56:24  <Sylph> any good starter package to mess with c++ ? Just for quick review

2010-09-30T02:57:45  <sigh> all the starter packs have roughly the same structure

2010-09-30T04:23:54  <boegel> delt0r___: it must be something unpredictable, but fairly frequent
2010-09-30T04:24:09  <boegel> delt0r___: it could also be shared resources, e.g. cache, that seriously slows down some bots
2010-09-30T04:24:13  <delt0r___> Well java gc on modern java is fast and dosent "burp"
2010-09-30T04:24:31  <delt0r___> but JIT ---well I could see that a bot that uses close to 1 sec
2010-09-30T04:24:40  <delt0r___> could go over on about turn 10
2010-09-30T04:24:52  <delt0r___> when it recompiles things
2010-09-30T04:25:05  <delt0r___> I see this in my production code...
2010-09-30T04:25:36  <delt0r___> a burp and a big speed up in the first few seconds... another one in about 30 odd seconds...
2010-09-30T04:25:57  <delt0r___> very fast for through put --not very "real time"
2010-09-30T04:26:18  <delt0r___> But this would only affect java... I understand other bots are having problems

2010-09-30T04:54:54  <boegel> if it is, it's a bad choice, exactly because of the unpredictability of Java and JIT
2010-09-30T04:55:01  <delt0r___> I thought they are running the python one on the server

2010-09-30T06:28:22  <rabidus> if you can compress that map into 32bit, i can hire you
2010-09-30T06:28:25  <delt0r___> however my tax department only takes cash
2010-09-30T06:29:12  <sigh> compress what map?
2010-09-30T06:29:17  <delt0r___> rabidus: Its kind of trivial to show there is more than 32bits of entropy in a map... ;)

2010-09-30T06:30:46  <Migi32> delt0r___, nope there aren't. There's just the map ID, if your program hard-codes the maps then I could encode the maps in (less than) 32 bit
2010-09-30T06:31:15  <delt0r___> Migi32: Its not a given that you only get the 100 prespecified maps
2010-09-30T06:31:21  <sigh> don't need to do that
2010-09-30T06:31:32  <sigh> you just need the seed for the random number generator
2010-09-30T06:31:36  <Migi32> ah alright then it's not possible
2010-09-30T06:31:40  <sigh> all maps are currently generated by the one script
2010-09-30T06:31:51  <Migi32> ^ or this
2010-09-30T06:31:57  <delt0r___> sigh: true... but that could change
2010-09-30T06:32:20  <sigh> well, if you want to store it in 32 bits, that your best option :P
2010-09-30T06:32:23  <delt0r___> not sure how it help however...

2010-09-30T07:54:57  <dmj111> mine does weird things like that too...
2010-09-30T07:55:52  <sigh> haha
2010-09-30T07:56:17  <sigh> yeah, I tried serveral times to fix that, but couldn't do it in a simple way without affect the rest of hte game
2010-09-30T07:56:22  <sigh> so it stays there for now :P
2010-09-30T07:56:48  <antimatroid2> i think i've mostly fixed those problems
2010-09-30T07:56:56  <sigh> my bot is too stupid to realise you are getting reinforcements
2010-09-30T07:57:55  <antimatroid2> wow, my current bot keeps timing out on the main server i think
2010-09-30T07:58:08  <antimatroid2> it's not breaking on every game here, so i don't think it's making illegal moves
2010-09-30T07:58:10  <sigh> :(

2010-09-30T08:00:52  <DanielVF> boegel yeah, I've turned off that last rackspace server
2010-09-30T08:01:03  <sigh> HakanD: oh, not disagreeing with you there :P
2010-09-30T08:01:12  <DanielVF> (that's where your latest timeout, and some other peoples, were happening)
2010-09-30T08:01:23  <boegel> DanielVF: hmmk
2010-09-30T08:01:30  <boegel> DanielVF: so, hardware problem then, or what?
2010-09-30T08:01:53  <boegel> I seem to be climbing in rank since, only winning games
2010-09-30T08:01:56  <boegel> DanielVF: good move! ;)
2010-09-30T08:02:07  <DanielVF> Yeah, the rackspace cloud servers are apparently pretty inconsistent in how fast they are
2010-09-30T08:02:09  * boegel resubmits the exact same bot to 'reset' his ranking

2010-09-30T08:06:30  <sigh> just a heads up, McLeopold says his new bot has special anti-dmj code :P
2010-09-30T08:07:18  <dmj111> I remeber I had this weird game early on where my bot sent 8,4,0,0,8,4,0,0,8,,4,0,0..... to a planet growing 4.  It was the only planet the enemy had, so it was still a win, but it was strange.
2010-09-30T08:07:18  <sigh> dunno when he's gonna release it to the main contest
2010-09-30T08:07:49  <dmj111> good to know.  I am doing a pretty serious rethink of mine.  My motivation came back when I got my internet back this morning :)
2010-09-30T08:08:04  <sigh> cool, will be fun to see what you guys come up with
2010-09-30T08:08:54  <sigh> the leaderboards funny... it's been completely turned upside down over the course of the last 12 hours... except me, I've just stayed in 7th place
2010-09-30T08:09:21  <sigh> the rest of you have been switching places like crazy :D
2010-09-30T08:10:07  <dmj111> :)   I think it will be pretty neat to see the games at the top at the end.
2010-09-30T08:10:22  <sigh> most defintely
2010-09-30T08:10:23  <dmj111> not a bad place to stay, sigh.
2010-09-30T08:10:27  <dmj111> (top ten)
2010-09-30T08:10:34  <sigh> yeah, I'm not complaining :P
2010-09-30T08:10:47  <sigh> though, honestly I'm very surprised to be there
2010-09-30T08:11:04  <dmj111> I hear ya.
2010-09-30T08:12:03  <sigh> the main advantage it gives me is that I can rant in the channel and people take my nonsense seriously :P

2010-09-30T08:13:33  <antimatroid2> the timer should be forcing it to exit well before timing out
2010-09-30T08:13:49  <sigh> :(
2010-09-30T08:14:04  <sigh> is your bot using close to 1s normally?

2010-09-30T08:54:43  <Migi32> tei, no it wasn't a draw, Hazard captured the 15 planet 1 turn sooner
2010-09-30T08:56:31  <sigh> ooo... Hazard's bot is aware of the turn limit
2010-09-30T08:56:49  <antimatroid2> sigh: no, was just expanding better
2010-09-30T08:57:11  <sigh> look at the last few moves of the game

2010-09-30T08:59:02  <antimatroid2> that's retarded
2010-09-30T08:59:04  <Migi32> ichti, show me some games where you didn't know why you lost, perhaps I can help

2010-09-30T08:59:17  <boegel> sigh: how does stopping to send help him then?
2010-09-30T08:59:28  <sigh> my point is that Hazard is not sending out fleets that won't affect the game result
2010-09-30T08:59:38  <boegel> sigh: true enough
2010-09-30T08:59:49  <sigh> the only thing I'm saying is that his bot is *aware* of the turn limit
2010-09-30T08:59:50  <boegel> sigh: he does seem aware, but that's not the reason why he won
2010-09-30T08:59:53  <sigh> not that it helped him here
2010-09-30T08:59:58  <ichti> Migi32, it's a code I haven't uploaded yet
2010-09-30T08:59:59  <boegel> sigh: yeah, right
2010-09-30T09:00:24  <tei> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4893030
2010-09-30T09:00:26  <sigh> oh well, I find that interesting in it's own right :P
2010-09-30T09:00:27  <Migi32> ichti, against what does it lose then? The default bot or TCP server players?
2010-09-30T09:00:30  <tei> what this
2010-09-30T09:01:00  <ichti> examplebot dualbot
2010-09-30T09:01:26  <Migi32> I think the server sometimes gets overloaded and times out bots that don't usually time out
2010-09-30T09:01:39  <Migi32> that, or there's a bug in server code
2010-09-30T09:02:01  <ichti> but shouldn't it then give a msg that i timed out? it have done that before.
2010-09-30T09:02:07  <ichti> but it doesn't in  this case
2010-09-30T09:02:11  <sigh> Migi32: DanielVF said earlier that he's swapped out the dodgy servers
2010-09-30T09:02:23  <sigh> so things should be better nw
2010-09-30T09:02:26  <sigh> *now
2010-09-30T09:02:41  <Migi32> then maybe it was just a genuine invalid move
2010-09-30T09:02:58  <antimatroid2> i can't get my bot to not fuck up atm, even though it runs fine on tcp :|
2010-09-30T09:03:13  <antimatroid2> i don't know if its illegal moves or timeouts, i'm assuming timeouts
2010-09-30T09:03:18  <sigh> too many negatives make my head hurt
2010-09-30T09:03:21  <ichti> I just don't get it. it seems like a legal move to me.
2010-09-30T09:03:36  <antimatroid2> is there any differences between the server engine and tcp engine? wrt automatic lost matches?

2010-09-30T09:08:35  <boegel> antimatroid2: tcp is more flexible regarding time-outs, because of network latency
2010-09-30T09:08:36  <Migi32> well tcp engine has a 5-second timeout while the main server has a 1-second timeout, I believe
2010-09-30T09:10:07  <sigh> tcp is 10 sec first move, 5 seconds after
2010-09-30T09:10:22  <sigh> main server is 1 sec all moves

2010-09-30T09:11:49  <antimatroid2> because that would be too simple

2010-09-30T09:12:23  <u1tr0n> you can count time for each step ad save so it on tcp server i have save timer in log file like --STEP 5 [0.032240152359009s]--
2010-09-30T09:12:51  <Migi32> you can't write to files on the server imo
2010-09-30T09:12:59  <Migi32> iirc*
2010-09-30T09:13:08  <antimatroid2> i have a timer, and i reduced it to doing almost nothing while still making moves and it dies, maybe i'm making illegal moves? but that doesn't explain it working on tcp

2010-09-30T09:18:26  <Migi32> % sure
2010-09-30T09:18:42  <Migi32> but it's kinda the way they play and how they rank up
2010-09-30T09:19:00  <Migi32> and the fact that they have 1 submission
2010-09-30T09:21:11  <boegel> Migi32: right, good thinking
2010-09-30T09:22:17  <Migi32> I'm going to post this game on the forum's thread about this
2010-09-30T09:23:03  <boegel> yeah, good idea

2010-09-30T09:32:43  <eregon> I'm currently searching the forum, but the answer is not obvious
2010-09-30T09:32:52  <HakanD> because of server
2010-09-30T09:33:02  <antimatroid2> i added if(num_ships > 0 && source_planet >=0 && source_planet < noPlanets && planets[source_planet].owner == 1 && destination_planet >=0 && destination_planet < noPlanets) to issueorder
2010-09-30T09:33:07  <boegel> HakanD: don't say that, sigh will hunt you down! :P
2010-09-30T09:33:08  <antimatroid2> so it can't possibly be an illegal move
2010-09-30T09:33:14  <antimatroid2> but i don't see how it could possibly time out either

2010-09-30T09:33:41  <sigh> why will I hunt anyone down?

2010-09-30T09:35:14  <sigh> I said nothing of the sort, I said that I *assumed* that antimatroid2 had ruled out the server because of what DanielVF said
2010-09-30T09:35:21  <boegel> antimatroid2: same bot @ TCP works fine?
2010-09-30T09:35:22  <bhasker> last move...i would say check for divide by zero
2010-09-30T09:35:23  <sigh> I'm all for blaming the server :P
2010-09-30T09:35:35  <DanielVF> lol
2010-09-30T09:35:35  <boegel> antimatroid2: tested it locally, while lowering the time-out too, against e.g. RageBot?
2010-09-30T09:35:40  <Migi32> is BB disabled on the forum?
2010-09-30T09:35:48  <DanielVF> Migi32 No
2010-09-30T09:35:49  <Migi32> BBcode
2010-09-30T09:35:59  <Migi32> is it disabled in the preview then?
2010-09-30T09:36:08  <boegel> DanielVF: time-out in first turn, loss by me -> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5044979
2010-09-30T09:36:18  <boegel> DanielVF: otherwise, haven't seen any issues like the ones before, yet
2010-09-30T09:36:23  <DanielVF> I think the some games are still getting stopped incorrectly. Just hopefuly a lot less.
2010-09-30T09:36:48  <boegel> antimatroid2: I'm seeing a loss in turn 0 too, see http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5044979
2010-09-30T09:36:56  <boegel> DanielVF: any idea what the cause behind this all is?

2010-09-30T09:38:15  <DanielVF> After that we can start fixing it for reals

2010-09-30T09:39:21  <boegel> cool
2010-09-30T09:39:46  <bhasker> boegel are you testing your bot on tcp?
2010-09-30T09:40:01  <HakanD> im still around 1500, unmodified starter bots sucks :p
2010-09-30T09:40:05  <boegel> bhasker: not right now, no
2010-09-30T09:40:09  <boegel> bhasker: and it needs work
2010-09-30T09:40:16  <bhasker> ah k
2010-09-30T09:40:32  <boegel> bhasker: seems like a problem here, you didn't fully lose that game yet: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5043632
2010-09-30T09:40:52  <boegel> same here: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5039015
2010-09-30T09:40:56  <bhasker> i did
2010-09-30T09:41:03  <bhasker> he has a bunch of ships
2010-09-30T09:41:06  <bhasker> incoming on that turn
2010-09-30T09:41:10  <bhasker> next turn i would have lost that planet
2010-09-30T09:41:33  <bhasker> the viewer usually stops 1 turn before the end of the game
2010-09-30T09:41:37  <boegel> bhasker: actually, it takes two more turns I think
2010-09-30T09:41:41  <boegel> bhasker: yeah, I know
2010-09-30T09:41:43  <bhasker> does it?
2010-09-30T09:41:50  <bhasker> i usually see it end like this
2010-09-30T09:41:52  <boegel> bhasker: surely it does in the last game
2010-09-30T09:41:55  <bhasker> even on tcp server
2010-09-30T09:42:02  <bhasker> that is if he has fleets
2010-09-30T09:42:03  <boegel> bhasker: yeah, but the fleet is closer imho
2010-09-30T09:42:16  <boegel> anyway, might just be me seeing ghosts :)
2010-09-30T09:42:28  <bhasker> not like that i could have won that one anyway :)
2010-09-30T09:42:40  <Migi32> bhasker: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5047191 <--- I think you have an off-by-1 miscalculation in your code wrt the 44 planet
2010-09-30T09:43:10  <bhasker> hmmm
2010-09-30T09:43:21  <bhasker> probably do lol i have been trying to fix that piece of code but its always buggy
2010-09-30T09:43:33  <bhasker> the way i do fleet resolution is messed up
2010-09-30T09:43:45  <boegel> :)
2010-09-30T09:43:45  <bhasker> i try not to allocate huge arrays for each planet
2010-09-30T09:44:13  <bhasker> so i use more like a walk and build a priority list into the future and figure out backwards how many i need
2010-09-30T09:44:25  <bhasker> i think i need to write some unit tests to check the code
2010-09-30T09:44:31  <bhasker> been lazy :-\
2010-09-30T09:44:39  <bhasker> thanks for pointing that out Migi
2010-09-30T09:45:02  <bhasker> oooh 104... 1 more win maybe!
2010-09-30T09:45:03  <Migi32> you're welcome :)
2010-09-30T09:45:36  <bhasker> do all of you like allocate a huge array to store all future states for each planet?
2010-09-30T09:45:41  <Migi32> I don't
2010-09-30T09:45:55  <bhasker> i didn't want to seemed like a huge waste to me
2010-09-30T09:46:17  <Migi32> only relevant states where something changes (other than the +growth per turn)
2010-09-30T09:46:21  <bhasker> yea
2010-09-30T09:46:22  <antimatroid2> i only do future states for the max distance of each planet each turn
2010-09-30T09:46:33  <antimatroid2> but it looks like turn limit will remain small enough for me to change that
2010-09-30T09:46:37  <bhasker> what do you mean maxdistance of each planet?
2010-09-30T09:46:51  <bhasker> mean how far the plane tis form other planets?
2010-09-30T09:47:28  <antimatroid2> yeah, each planet has a furtherst planet away from it
2010-09-30T09:47:36  <bhasker> my bot needs a fix to not go for neutrals right next to enemy
2010-09-30T09:47:41  <Migi32> 200 turns * 1 int * 4 bytes / int * 23 planets = 18 KB
2010-09-30T09:47:50  <Migi32> that's allright :)

2010-09-30T09:48:43  <bhasker> hmm weird the guy sent 68 ships to capture a planet of size 5

2010-09-30T09:49:12  <boegel> bhasker: maybe he's taking into account the number of ships you can get there before his fleet arrives?
2010-09-30T09:49:15  <bhasker> yes but trying to understand logic
2010-09-30T09:49:18  <bhasker> hmm

2010-09-30T09:49:35  <bhasker> he did it in the next turn
2010-09-30T09:49:45  * boegel should shut up actually
2010-09-30T09:49:47  <bhasker> first turn he just launched one fleet
2010-09-30T09:49:49  <boegel> bhasker: did what?
2010-09-30T09:49:56  <boegel> bhasker: that doesn't make sense

2010-09-30T09:51:10  <bhasker> no i meant in the first turn he launched just one fleet and waited till second turn to launch the reset
2010-09-30T09:51:11  <bhasker> rest*
2010-09-30T09:51:22  <bhasker> thats why he was able to counter my fleet with a large 68 fleet
2010-09-30T09:51:40  <boegel> right
2010-09-30T09:51:43  <boegel> that does make sense
2010-09-30T09:51:54  <bhasker> maybe for close setups
2010-09-30T09:52:00  <bhasker> i should add a heuristic maybe not sure
2010-09-30T09:52:01  <boegel> bhasker: actually, countering is stupid, he should take over planets you just took over
2010-09-30T09:52:11  <boegel> bhasker: because those are cheap

2010-09-30T09:52:48  <bhasker> and i think my calculations as migi pointed out are off by 1
2010-09-30T09:53:00  <boegel> that's bad, might cost you
2010-09-30T09:53:11  <bhasker> actually by a whole growth rate

2010-09-30T09:53:22  <boegel> that's even worse! :P
2010-09-30T09:53:29  <bhasker> check the planet below his
2010-09-30T09:53:31  <bhasker> he sends 20
2010-09-30T09:53:33  <bhasker> i send 6
2010-09-30T09:53:39  <bhasker> i capture it the he does
2010-09-30T09:53:47  <bhasker> it leaves 19 ships against my 20
2010-09-30T09:53:52  <bhasker> next turn he is left with 4
2010-09-30T09:53:59  <bhasker> looks like i miscalculated # of turns
2010-09-30T09:54:21  <bhasker> time to write the damn unit test

2010-09-30T10:04:00  <bhasker> oh not the tcp games ,i have states for all of them
2010-09-30T10:04:04  <bhasker> i meant for the games on the server
2010-09-30T10:04:26  <bhasker> doh actualy i forgot that the script takes a url
2010-09-30T10:04:48  <bhasker> i don't understand how come dmj's bot is doing so well given that its so conservative
2010-09-30T10:05:04  <sigh> the bots at the top are quite defensive
2010-09-30T10:05:06  <boegel> bhasker: maybe because the other bots are making mistakes
2010-09-30T10:05:18  <bhasker> hmm
2010-09-30T10:05:20  <sigh> but also, I don't think dmj1.8 is what is in the main contest
2010-09-30T10:05:24  <bhasker> aah
2010-09-30T10:05:30  <boegel> use the stupidity of your enemy to your advantage
2010-09-30T10:05:39  <bhasker> well at least its dominating the tcp server right now
2010-09-30T10:05:41  <bhasker> its at #1
2010-09-30T10:05:52  <bhasker> with a 92% success rate
2010-09-30T10:05:52  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T10:06:47  <bhasker> yay

2010-09-30T10:06:52  <bhasker> finally!
2010-09-30T10:07:11  <bhasker> btw Daniel server is playing games much faster now
2010-09-30T10:07:19  <ichti> hehe
2010-09-30T10:07:22  <bhasker> i seem to be getting 7-8 games every hour
2010-09-30T10:07:36  <sigh> example, here's a game bw me and dmj... you can see we are both quite defensive near the start: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5041300
2010-09-30T10:08:14  <bhasker> you are more aggressive than his
2010-09-30T10:08:21  <bhasker> his doesnt even capture any of the neutrals
2010-09-30T10:08:36  <bhasker> not even the 23/10 planets
2010-09-30T10:08:38  <sigh> yeah, my bot expands quite rapidly
2010-09-30T10:08:49  <bhasker> he should have taken those at the least
2010-09-30T10:08:53  <sigh> many of my losses are because of that, in fact
2010-09-30T10:08:59  <Florian95> on AI CONTEST, time is USA time...
2010-09-30T10:09:06  <bhasker> happens to my bot too
2010-09-30T10:09:13  <Florian95> what time it is for you ?
2010-09-30T10:09:14  <bhasker> my bot will take neutrals when it can
2010-09-30T10:09:14  <boegel> sigh: nice game

2010-09-30T10:09:38  <sigh> yeah, I like that game... funny ending too :P
2010-09-30T10:09:41  <boegel> Florian95: ^
2010-09-30T10:09:46  <bhasker> it was a lost game for dmj's bot the moment it didnt take the 23/10 planets
2010-09-30T10:09:48  <Florian95> thx
2010-09-30T10:09:52  <bhasker> your growth rate would kill him anyway

2010-09-30T10:09:57  <Florian95> cool
2010-09-30T10:10:19  <boegel> Florian95: server differs 1h from that afaik
2010-09-30T10:10:27  <sigh> bhasker: agree
2010-09-30T10:10:39  <DanielVF> Do you guys like the current match selection?
2010-09-30T10:10:48  <DanielVF> Who it's picking for opponents?
2010-09-30T10:10:48  <Florian95> so it is 9am
2010-09-30T10:10:49  <Florian95> ?
2010-09-30T10:10:53  <sigh> DanielVF: much better than before
2010-09-30T10:11:25  <DanielVF> sigh Good
2010-09-30T10:11:51  <sigh> most of my games are against top 10-20, so that's a good sign :)

2010-09-30T10:12:38  <DanielVF> Plus ones farther away
2010-09-30T10:12:44  <bhasker> yes daniel its much better

2010-09-30T10:13:42  <sigh> I've got a recent game against rank 288
2010-09-30T10:13:55  <DanielVF> Yup
2010-09-30T10:14:06  <Naktibalda> sigh: you can call it a teaching game
2010-09-30T10:14:07  <DanielVF> It's uses a pareto curve to pick bots
2010-09-30T10:14:17  <sigh> ok, fair enough
2010-09-30T10:14:21  <DanielVF> 80/20 rule
2010-09-30T10:14:51  <DanielVF> The longshot games give chances to move up faster
2010-09-30T10:15:11  <DanielVF> As well as seeing how you do against bots of a quite different caliber
2010-09-30T10:15:21  <sigh> yeah, makes sense
2010-09-30T10:15:21  <DanielVF> as well as keeping local minima from occuring
2010-09-30T10:15:49  <sigh> it will become more important if you guys start new submissions at the old rank
2010-09-30T10:16:00  <sigh> currently everyone has to fight their way up, so not such a big deal

2010-09-30T10:46:01  <Guest90163> which language?

2010-09-30T10:48:37  <antimatroid2> i have had my bot up there previously fine
2010-09-30T10:48:42  <antimatroid2> doesn't cause errors running on tcp

2010-09-30T10:50:14  <delt0r_> antimatroid2: Just play on the TCP untill the main server is working again... still got plenty of ti,e
2010-09-30T10:50:16  <delt0r_> time
2010-09-30T10:50:32  <delt0r_> I haven't even bothered with the main site yet
2010-09-30T10:50:55  <delt0r_> but then i am getting the smack down handed to me on tcp
2010-09-30T10:51:54  <antimatroid2> i'm pretty sure this is an error from me somehow
2010-09-30T10:52:13  <antimatroid2> nobody else seems to be having this problem right now, well they aren't in here bitching about it like i am :P
2010-09-30T10:52:28  <delt0r_> mmm... we can get a current version of the game engine code right...
2010-09-30T10:54:50  <HakanD> antimatroid2, take a walk than, some fresh air really helps

2010-09-30T11:04:17  <troutwine> iPhones are 64 bit? Seems like a waste of byte widths, unless those things have a preposterous amount of addressable memory.

2010-09-30T11:34:52  <jmcarthur> green threads are allowed because they aren't OS threads
2010-09-30T11:35:40  <jmcarthur> and therefore don't gain you additional CPU time or anything like that

2010-09-30T11:47:31  <Naktibalda> In IEEE 754 arithmetic, a ÷ +0 is positive infinity when a is positive, negative infinity when a is negative, and NaN when a = ±0. The infinity signs change when dividing by −0 instead.

2010-09-30T12:18:12  <McLeopold> Sometimes

2010-09-30T12:18:15  <dwchandler> sometimes (only when it is)
2010-09-30T12:18:47  <McLeopold> If you need the position, then your probably losing.
2010-09-30T12:18:57  <delt0r_> the top ten guys seem to value position better than others... imo
2010-09-30T12:19:07  <McLeopold> Yes they do.
2010-09-30T12:19:22  <McLeopold> That's why I'm not in the top ten anymore. :)
2010-09-30T12:19:33  <Migi32> ugh... my bot totally ignores position when looking into the future

2010-09-30T12:22:16  <McLeopold> I have memoization on all my functions, so I probably use a lot of ram.
2010-09-30T12:23:01  <McLeopold> Not with my bot.  I also stripped all logging out.  I have checks to prevent invalid orders.
2010-09-30T12:23:50  <McLeopold> The admins are getting close to solving the problem.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Just focus on making your bot.
2010-09-30T12:23:59  <delt0r_> yea
2010-09-30T12:24:41  <delt0r_> does python do the memoization for you or do you do it yourself? (not a big python user)
2010-09-30T12:25:20  <McLeopold> I do it myself.  I'm doing alot myself that there are probably libraries for.  I'm just not sure what would be on the server.
2010-09-30T12:25:33  <delt0r_> true... same here...
2010-09-30T12:25:58  <McLeopold> If you boil a bot down, it just does a lot with numbers.  Most languages have that without extra stuff.
2010-09-30T12:26:06  <delt0r_> I would love to use some code weaving libs for java... in particular co-routines...

2010-09-30T12:30:02  <McLeopold> why not 17?
2010-09-30T12:30:10  <delt0r_> power of 2
2010-09-30T12:30:19  <McLeopold> prime?

2010-09-30T12:37:56  <bhasker> divide by zero is an undefined operation
2010-09-30T12:38:10  <McLeopold> In javascript it returns infinity.
2010-09-30T12:38:17  <bhasker> that is wrong
2010-09-30T12:38:26  <bhasker> mathematically it should return NaN
2010-09-30T12:38:35  <McLeopold> It doesn't say which level of infinity though.
2010-09-30T12:38:46  <delt0r_> bhasker: You can argure about  in the limit
2010-09-30T12:39:02  <McLeopold> Well, yes, but at lease you can look for it instead of crashing.
2010-09-30T12:39:08  <delt0r_> since in floating point is zero really exactly zero
2010-09-30T12:39:16  <bhasker> nope
2010-09-30T12:39:42  <bhasker> in fact doing equality in floating point numbers will probably never work correctly
2010-09-30T12:39:51  <bhasker> in computers due to limited precision
2010-09-30T12:40:09  <bhasker> and due to the fact that some numbers are irrational too
2010-09-30T12:40:10  <McLeopold> at some level the bits will match
2010-09-30T12:40:12  <delt0r_> its still not a good idea... even in computers...
2010-09-30T12:40:39  <bhasker> best way to compare floating point is > or < or if they are withing some predefined episolon value
2010-09-30T12:40:48  <delt0r_> yea
2010-09-30T12:41:00  <bhasker> equality is never guaranteed to work in computers for floats
2010-09-30T12:41:05  <delt0r_> in math... the measure is finite.
2010-09-30T12:41:11  <McLeopold> Tell that to the guys who don't want drawn games...
2010-09-30T12:41:27  <delt0r_> but thats integers...
2010-09-30T12:41:41  <delt0r_> integers are countable...
2010-09-30T12:41:53  <McLeopold> In this contest, you don't need floats.
2010-09-30T12:42:13  <delt0r_> I don't have any after parsing the map
2010-09-30T12:42:13  <bhasker> well you do, if you are doing heuristics for internal calculations
2010-09-30T12:42:29  <kincody> if you divide  an int by an int.. dont you get a float
2010-09-30T12:42:37  <bhasker> not in computers
2010-09-30T12:42:49  <bhasker> an int by an int is an integer division
2010-09-30T12:42:51  <bhasker> in most languages
2010-09-30T12:42:55  <bhasker> so it will return the integral part
2010-09-30T12:43:06  <bhasker> unless you explicitly cast one of the operands to a float
2010-09-30T12:43:16  <bhasker> in which case the computer will do a floating point operation
2010-09-30T12:43:24  <Florian95> someone have installed the server : http://72.44.46.68/ ?
2010-09-30T12:44:03  <bhasker> does not compute florian
2010-09-30T12:44:31  <McLeopold> Did you mean, has someone setup a secondary server?
2010-09-30T12:46:21  <Florian95> yes
2010-09-30T12:46:32  <Florian95> When i write ../tcp/tcp localhost 995 testbot /usr/bin/env ruby ./MyBot.rb

2010-09-30T12:46:54  <Florian95> he say "connect: Permission denied"
2010-09-30T12:46:55  <Florian95> :s
2010-09-30T12:47:18  <jmcarthur> kincody: in some languages, dividing an int by an int is actually a type error because ints can't express fractions anyway
2010-09-30T12:47:35  <Florian95> sorry its good
2010-09-30T12:47:47  <McLeopold> There a new password switch now.
2010-09-30T12:47:52  <bhasker> you sure about that jmcarthur? i am yet to encounter a language that disallows division of integers
2010-09-30T12:48:09  <jmcarthur> bhasker: you can still use div in those languages, but / fails to type check
2010-09-30T12:48:18  <jmcarthur> bhasker: haskell is an example
2010-09-30T12:48:20  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-09-30T12:48:28  <bhasker> hmm never coded in haskell
2010-09-30T12:48:42  <bhasker> actually never done much of functional programming
2010-09-30T12:49:10  <jmcarthur> (and in fact you could make it type check with / by instantiating a type class for Int, but then you are violating some unspoken rules)

2010-09-30T12:50:26  <jmcarthur> instance Fractional Int where (/) = div ; fromRational = round   -- very bad, but would make it type check

2010-09-30T12:50:54  <jmcarthur> it's also an orphan instance, so you would get a loud warning with -Wall

2010-09-30T13:03:58  <jmcarthur> looking into the future would mean you can see that you won't win in that situation
2010-09-30T13:04:20  <jmcarthur> the inaction implies that the bot has no idea

2010-09-30T13:07:12  <boegel> DanielVF: bad news: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5050594
2010-09-30T13:07:20  <McLeopold> It's surprising that Accoun loses other games but can beat dmj
2010-09-30T13:07:25  <boegel> DanielVF: maybe your additional logging can tell you what's going on?
2010-09-30T13:07:28  <jmcarthur> not to me
2010-09-30T13:07:44  <jmcarthur> Accoun simply exposes a flaw
2010-09-30T13:07:54  <DanielVF> Hmm.
2010-09-30T13:08:02  <McLeopold> Yes, but I find revealing a flaw "surprising"
2010-09-30T13:08:08  <bhasker> mc my bot which is like 46 on tcp can beat dmj
2010-09-30T13:08:12  <bhasker> he is too conservative
2010-09-30T13:08:22  <bhasker> on maps where there are dense planets near starting area
2010-09-30T13:08:23  <McLeopold> got any matches to show?
2010-09-30T13:08:31  <bhasker> yes if its not been purged hold on
2010-09-30T13:08:33  <bhasker> let me check
2010-09-30T13:08:43  <DanielVF> boegel That was just before I put logging on to all servers. :(
2010-09-30T13:08:47  <DanielVF> I don't have that game.
2010-09-30T13:08:56  <bhasker> how do i look for irc logs
2010-09-30T13:09:44  <bhasker> anyone?
2010-09-30T13:09:48  <bhasker> nm
2010-09-30T13:09:49  <jmcarthur> actually, it's possible that dmj looks into the future but is too conservative to make a risky move
2010-09-30T13:09:49  <bhasker> doh
2010-09-30T13:10:15  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: yeah, I think your right
2010-09-30T13:10:46  <McLeopold> On very simple symmetrical maps, you can prove the best move is no move, but wait for opponent.
2010-09-30T13:10:57  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=240851
2010-09-30T13:10:59  <bhasker> found it
2010-09-30T13:11:07  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: wait for your opponent to make a mistake you mean?
2010-09-30T13:11:30  <bhasker> his bot could have won it if he had bothered expanding
2010-09-30T13:11:36  <bhasker> he just stuck with his 4 planets
2010-09-30T13:11:38  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: yes
2010-09-30T13:12:07  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: or more specifically, wait for him to invest in neutral at the wrong time or distance
2010-09-30T13:12:15  <boegel> DanielVF: ah
2010-09-30T13:12:34  <McLeopold> bhasker: I wonder what dmj was thinking
2010-09-30T13:12:40  <bhasker> no idea^
2010-09-30T13:12:43  <boegel> DanielVF: k, I'll let you know when I notice another one then
2010-09-30T13:12:44  <boegel> gotta run
2010-09-30T13:12:45  <bhasker> as i said
2010-09-30T13:12:45  <boegel> ttyl
2010-09-30T13:12:47  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i'm not so sure that dmj was thinking that while waiting for accoun though
2010-09-30T13:12:47  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.192.80> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-09-30T13:12:49  <bhasker> its too conservative
2010-09-30T13:12:54  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: he could have expanded safely
2010-09-30T13:13:21  <jmcarthur> he even had the lead in ship count for the first part of their standoff
2010-09-30T13:13:44  <McLeopold> dmj has got a good bot, so he has some solid ideas about what planets to target
2010-09-30T13:13:45  <jmcarthur> since he didn't take those extra neutrals
2010-09-30T13:14:03  <McLeopold> Sure we can find flaws, but fixing them might make him weaker in other areas.
2010-09-30T13:14:15  <jmcarthur> i am by no means saying it's a bad bot ;)
2010-09-30T13:14:19  <McLeopold> So, I'd like to know why this "flaw" makes him strong.
2010-09-30T13:14:32  <jmcarthur> a good angle to try
2010-09-30T13:14:45  <bhasker> only reason his bot does well is the sudden attack with 200 ships
2010-09-30T13:14:54  <bhasker> its hard to counter if you are busy expanding
2010-09-30T13:15:10  <bhasker> he almost always counterattacks right after the opponent expands to a neutral
2010-09-30T13:15:15  <McLeopold> It's brilliant.  I need that in my bot.
2010-09-30T13:15:17  <jmcarthur> i think that's his sun tsu showing
2010-09-30T13:15:25  <bhasker> his bot i think waits till you commit many ships to something else
2010-09-30T13:15:29  <jmcarthur> or is it tzu?
2010-09-30T13:15:34  <bhasker> tsu is right
2010-09-30T13:15:42  <jmcarthur> i always forget
2010-09-30T13:15:47  <McLeopold> My bot does the same thing, but it's just a side affect of other logic.
2010-09-30T13:15:57  <McLeopold> And it does it poorly.
2010-09-30T13:16:01  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-30T13:16:18  <DanielVF> I'm thinking of taking bots that issue unparseable or invalid orders out of the game rotation
2010-09-30T13:16:20  <bhasker> my bot is too aggressive
2010-09-30T13:16:30  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=bhaskerv20.6
2010-09-30T13:16:36  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: why? those bots have short games anyway, don't they?
2010-09-30T13:16:38  <bhasker> keeps trying to expand almost all the time
2010-09-30T13:16:41  <bhasker> even when its losing^
2010-09-30T13:17:03  <bhasker> and does badly when starting positions are close by
2010-09-30T13:17:04  <McLeopold> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5057640
2010-09-30T13:17:12  <McLeopold> I just beat dmj at his own game!
2010-09-30T13:17:13  <troutwine> jmcarthur: Wastes resources to run a bad bot, no?
2010-09-30T13:17:22  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: i would only try that after having a way to report such errors to the developers
2010-09-30T13:17:24  <McLeopold> Counter launch of large fleet
2010-09-30T13:17:49  <DanielVF> jmcarthur: We spend a bit of time picking and setting up for games
2010-09-30T13:17:50  <jmcarthur> troutwine: even if it only issues an invalid order once out of every 10 games or so, say?
2010-09-30T13:18:06  <bhasker> see he only attacked when you took the 70 neutral
2010-09-30T13:18:12  <bhasker> till then his bot just kept piling ships up
2010-09-30T13:18:22  <troutwine> jmcarthur: Good point.
2010-09-30T13:18:23  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: has there been any work on giving better error messages yet?
2010-09-30T13:18:29  <DanielVF> jmcarthur: Also, the bad order's don't always come at the start of the game
2010-09-30T13:18:52  <DanielVF> jmcarthur: I'm going to add to the bottom of the visualizer what caused the game loss.

2010-09-30T13:19:07  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: once that's there i wouldn't object to removing such bots from rotation
2010-09-30T13:19:09  <troutwine> That's the turn that McLeopold had the lowest ship counts in his planets, as well.
2010-09-30T13:19:18  <jmcarthur> before, though, i think a lot of people might see it as unfair
2010-09-30T13:19:31  <jmcarthur> just like the timeout thing
2010-09-30T13:19:35  <DanielVF> So it will say "Crash/Timeout", "Invalid Order", or "Unparseable Error"
2010-09-30T13:19:50  <DanielVF> I won't be removing Crash/Timeout
2010-09-30T13:20:00  <jmcarthur> there is no visible difference between crash and timeout?
2010-09-30T13:20:01  <McLeopold> "You bot issues invalid orders during 10% of games.  It will now play less games."
2010-09-30T13:20:02  <DanielVF> untill the error reporting can tell the difference
2010-09-30T13:20:04  <troutwine> DanielVF: Could the message also include the invalid order and unparseable text given?
2010-09-30T13:20:06  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-30T13:20:12  <McLeopold> "Oh, I better fix my bot so I get more games!"
2010-09-30T13:20:28  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i like that but it would be tougher to do
2010-09-30T13:20:33  <DanielVF> troutwine possibly
2010-09-30T13:21:02  <McLeopold> DanielVF: is there any logic to make sure bots play maps evenly?
2010-09-30T13:21:23  <DanielVF> McLeopold Bots play maps *randomly
2010-09-30T13:21:24  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: how about bad bots aren't picked as player 1 (to seed a match) but are still eligible to be the other player?
2010-09-30T13:21:29  <DanielVF> but not evenly.
2010-09-30T13:21:46  <bhasker> weirdly enough mcleopold my bot is yet to play a game against yours on tcp
2010-09-30T13:21:57  <McLeopold> DanielVF: I think evenly would be better.  Some maps favor different strategies.
2010-09-30T13:21:59  <DanielVF> jmcarthur We'll a bad bot makes an invalid game for the other player, as well as for the bad bot
2010-09-30T13:22:13  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: you mean those games don't even count for score?
2010-09-30T13:22:27  <McLeopold> bhasker: yeah, I wish we could connect and wait for certain players.
2010-09-30T13:22:51  <DanielVF> jmcarthur: They do, but they aren't fun to watch. The reapeat offenders tend to end on turn 0
2010-09-30T13:22:51  <bhasker> does the tcp server do the same way of matching as the official
2010-09-30T13:22:55  <bhasker> i think it matches randomly
2010-09-30T13:23:00  <DanielVF> bhasker not at all
2010-09-30T13:23:20  <McLeopold> DanielVF: maybe a bad game won't count against a bots seeding wait time?
2010-09-30T13:23:21  <bhasker> hmm so its using elo rating to pick opponents?
2010-09-30T13:23:35  <DanielVF> McLeopold too much coding. :(
2010-09-30T13:23:37  <McLeopold> DanielVF: for the winning bot of course
2010-09-30T13:23:51  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: working bots should only be paired with malfunctioning bots very rarely though, shouldn't they? the broken ones should have much lower rankings, right?
2010-09-30T13:24:07  <McLeopold> It can't be much harder than send fleets around?
2010-09-30T13:24:19  <DanielVF> Interesting idea
2010-09-30T13:24:45  <DanielVF> Writing SQL to check
2010-09-30T13:25:45  <jmcarthur> broken bots having low ranks and not being seeded from should be enough to make such games extremely low in number, i think
2010-09-30T13:26:35  <kincody> Dont all broken bots get Disqualified?Whats wrong with playing a malfunc bot?
2010-09-30T13:27:31  <jmcarthur> kincody: IMO, if you have a broken bot on the server than works locally, it could be nice to have at least a few games with basic error messages so you can diagnose your bot and see why it's breaking in a few different games
2010-09-30T13:27:43  <jmcarthur> even if you don't get debug output or anything
2010-09-30T13:28:01  <jmcarthur> *on the server, but it works locally
2010-09-30T13:28:12  <kincody> That makes sense..
2010-09-30T13:28:22  <DanielVF> Compilers usualy give you one error

2010-09-30T13:29:20  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: breaking in game X doesn't necessarily tell you much, but breaking in games X, Y, and Z can tell you that there is something in common about those games

2010-09-30T13:29:41  <DanielVF> *nods*
2010-09-30T13:30:14  <DanielVF> Maybe I should make it so the winner does not see a game that his opponent failed on.
2010-09-30T13:30:25  <DanielVF> On his profile page.
2010-09-30T13:30:28  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: i think if it affects his score he should see it
2010-09-30T13:30:46  <McLeopold> DanielVF: only if it is not used for rankings
2010-09-30T13:30:46  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: but if games are tagged the way they are on the tcp server then they can know not to bother watching it
2010-09-30T13:31:03  <DanielVF> jmcarthur Ah. I may just tag 'em
2010-09-30T13:31:09  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: like here http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=McLeopold.6.2
2010-09-30T13:31:11  <McLeopold> DanielVF: it would be nice to see how each game affected your ranking
2010-09-30T13:31:12  <jmcarthur> Loss^T
2010-09-30T13:31:22  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: it's not that easy to identify
2010-09-30T13:31:26  <McLeopold> "Loss to dmj111: -500"
2010-09-30T13:31:37  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: it's not a concrete number of points
2010-09-30T13:31:49  <McLeopold> I'm thinking of true elo and glicko.
2010-09-30T13:31:52  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-30T13:31:59  <jmcarthur> i still think trueskill would be rockin'
2010-09-30T13:32:09  <DanielVF> Yeah, it takes into account all the games of your opponent as well - and future games of his after you beat him.
2010-09-30T13:32:18  <DanielVF> or lose to him
2010-09-30T13:33:03  <jmcarthur> i mainly like the idea of trueskill because it has a matching algorithm that can get your ranking closer to actual sooner after a resubmission
2010-09-30T13:33:14  <jmcarthur> at least if we adapt it
2010-09-30T13:33:20  <jmcarthur> i still need to test that though
2010-09-30T13:33:42  <McLeopold> So, on the tcp rankings page, what does oppo. column mean?
2010-09-30T13:34:06  <McLeopold> Unique oppo. played?
2010-09-30T13:34:13  <DanielVF> Lol - I just realized why I can't make bad order games not count
2010-09-30T13:34:28  <DanielVF> You could just make a bad order anytime you were loosing.
2010-09-30T13:34:29  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: can't be. that number is sometimes larger than games played

2010-09-30T13:48:06  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: doesn't a larger draw prob increase the value of winning?
2010-09-30T13:48:28  <jmcarthur> i think so, but we don't want to do that artificially
2010-09-30T13:48:29  <DanielVF> jmcarthur 1%-2%
2010-09-30T13:48:38  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: thanks
2010-09-30T13:48:39  <DanielVF> and most of those are two bad bots facing each other
2010-09-30T13:48:44  <jmcarthur> ugh
2010-09-30T13:48:46  <jmcarthur> okay
2010-09-30T13:49:22  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: what about top 100 bots? i don't suppose you wrote a query for that number that you can easily tweak
2010-09-30T13:49:25  <Zannick> draws are highly unlikely
2010-09-30T13:50:46  <DanielVF> jmcarthur can't do that easily
2010-09-30T13:50:55  <DanielVF> Sap_ Try submittign one more time
2010-09-30T13:51:06  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: alright, thanks anyway
2010-09-30T13:51:09  <DanielVF> It thinks your latest submission isn't processed all the way
2010-09-30T13:51:23  <DanielVF> Sap_ so it's not giving it games

2010-09-30T13:55:15  <DanielVF> Different version of java?

2010-09-30T13:58:39  <McLeopold> That map should not be allowed
2010-09-30T13:58:58  <Zannick> i was wondering when such a map would show up
2010-09-30T13:59:13  <Zannick> good thing the fix for that was pushed to trunk yesterday :D
2010-09-30T13:59:25  <McLeopold> Zannick: what was the fix?
2010-09-30T13:59:57  <McLeopold> It would be fun if there were a bunch of 1 ship planets around
2010-09-30T14:00:09  <Zannick> check that map_generator doesn't put the starting planets too_close to the starting planets
2010-09-30T14:00:20  <Zannick> er, too close to the center planet
2010-09-30T14:00:20  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: lol
2010-09-30T14:00:58  <Zannick> and it disallows distances of 1
2010-09-30T14:01:26  <Zannick> i'm pretty sure both those planets are 1 away from the center

2010-09-30T14:20:12  <bhasker> time to see what stupid decisions my bot made^
2010-09-30T14:20:22  <bhasker> i need to clean up my logging
2010-09-30T14:20:43  <McLeopold> bhasker: it looks like you took a neutral when you couldn't spare the time on the second one
2010-09-30T14:20:59  <bhasker> yea my bot is aggresive it doesn't wait next turn
2010-09-30T14:21:08  <bhasker> i need to add some logic to not take a neutral just because it can
2010-09-30T14:21:18  <bhasker> when it could probably take a better neutral next turn
2010-09-30T14:21:30  <bhasker> as long as it has ships it will try to take over something
2010-09-30T14:21:34  <bhasker> works sometimes
2010-09-30T14:21:38  <bhasker> but sometimes it just goes dumb
2010-09-30T14:21:40  <McLeopold> works on some maps
2010-09-30T14:21:43  <bhasker> yea
2010-09-30T14:21:52  <bhasker> sometimes it will send like 20 ships off to get a 1 growth planet
2010-09-30T14:22:31  <McLeopold> that would be okay if your opponent is 50 turns away...
2010-09-30T14:22:39  <bhasker> yea
2010-09-30T14:22:43  <bhasker> need to fix some of that:)
2010-09-30T14:22:51  <Zannick> i had a very interesting minor error
2010-09-30T14:23:04  <bhasker> yea it sent like 36 ships to capture aneutral at the bottom left
2010-09-30T14:23:11  <bhasker> when it should have been attacking your planets
2010-09-30T14:23:12  <Zannick> where it sees the opponent is 22 turns away at the start
2010-09-30T14:23:28  <Zannick> and thinks it can send 110 ships
2010-09-30T14:23:58  <Zannick> rather, saw * / thought *

2010-09-30T14:43:55  <jmcarthur> i wonder what the typical change in rank is after a resubmission
2010-09-30T14:44:03  <jmcarthur> that affects one of the parameters of my test
2010-09-30T14:44:26  <jmcarthur> the typical change in actual rank, that is, not estimated
2010-09-30T14:44:28  <McLeopold> I wonder if I resubmit if the entire top 20 rankings will be switched.
2010-09-30T14:44:37  <jmcarthur> switched?
2010-09-30T14:44:39  <jmcarthur> shouldn't be
2010-09-30T14:44:45  <jmcarthur> they keep all their games with your old bot
2010-09-30T14:44:52  <McLeopold> really?
2010-09-30T14:44:54  <jmcarthur> yes
2010-09-30T14:45:07  <jmcarthur> and their score won't be affected by yours until they play you again
2010-09-30T14:45:08  <McLeopold> That seems wrong
2010-09-30T14:45:15  <jmcarthur> every submission is treated as a new bot entirely
2010-09-30T14:45:31  <McLeopold> hmm...
2010-09-30T14:45:32  <jmcarthur> and old submissions are simply removed from the rankings rather than dropped entirely
2010-09-30T14:45:39  <jmcarthur> i think it's good, personally
2010-09-30T14:45:53  <jmcarthur> it reduces volatility and keeps the estimates more accurate
2010-09-30T14:46:02  <McLeopold> Yes, that makes a lot of sense.
2010-09-30T14:46:49  <jmcarthur> that would change under my proposed trueskill application, but under than your score won't depend on current games by past opponents anyway
2010-09-30T14:46:51  <McLeopold> I wish I could see the "rankings" of the older bots.
2010-09-30T14:47:05  <jmcarthur> *under that
2010-09-30T14:47:15  <jmcarthur> which is actually a weakness of my proposal
2010-09-30T14:47:35  <jmcarthur> but it is perhaps more intuitive anyway
2010-09-30T14:47:42  <McLeopold> Until submitting is final.
2010-09-30T14:47:49  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-30T14:48:14  <jmcarthur> once no more submissions are allowed, i'm certain that bayeselo is superior (but not our current matchmaking algorithm)
2010-09-30T14:48:54  <jmcarthur> in combination with trueskill's matchmaking formula i suspect it could still possibly be superior
2010-09-30T14:49:00  <jmcarthur> but that's what i'd like to test

2010-09-30T15:07:54  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: but i'm experimenting with a way to take older versions of your bot into account when determining your new rank
2010-09-30T15:08:24  <jmcarthur> by using an iterative algorithm rather than a batch one and simply decreasing your confidence when you resubmit
2010-09-30T15:09:01  <boegel> jmcarthur: is that a good idea? is the whole point of resubmitting that you get a fresh start?
2010-09-30T15:09:24  <boegel> Migi32: you're UGent too? I totally missed that before :D
2010-09-30T15:09:29  <jmcarthur> boegel: if you decrease the confidence then the only affect it has is on the choice of starting opponents
2010-09-30T15:09:40  <jmcarthur> boegel: your final score will be the same after you play enough games either way
2010-09-30T15:10:02  <jmcarthur> boegel: but it may take fewer games if you have only evolved your bot

2010-09-30T15:10:52  <jmcarthur> boegel: fewer than completley starting over, i mean
2010-09-30T15:11:03  <boegel> Migi32: I was a PhD student until 2 weeks ago when I graduated :)

2010-09-30T15:12:09  <boegel> Migi32: do you still have classes @ S9?
2010-09-30T15:12:09  <Sylph> jmcarthur any idea about updating C# support ? :/
2010-09-30T15:12:18  <jmcarthur> Sylph: nope. i'm not an admin
2010-09-30T15:12:22  <Sylph> ah ok :(
2010-09-30T15:12:34  <Sylph> I rewrote my java bot to c# hoping it would at least work with c# 2.0 like it said on the site

2010-09-30T15:12:54  <Migi32> boegel, didn't have that yet, and I'm sorry but what is S9?
2010-09-30T15:12:57  <Sylph> and out of 5 submission of same bot one succeeded
2010-09-30T15:12:58  <Sylph> :|

2010-09-30T15:21:39  <Itkovian> ah. S9 is a building on De Sterre.
2010-09-30T15:21:51  <Itkovian> So you were in CA last year ;-)
2010-09-30T15:22:05  <Itkovian> Feedback is always welcome
2010-09-30T15:22:12  <Migi32> yea, by Koen De Bosschere, great guy
2010-09-30T15:22:26  <Migi32> we have most classes in de Plateau
2010-09-30T15:22:53  <boegel> Migi32: ah, you're ir CS
2010-09-30T15:23:02  <boegel> or...
2010-09-30T15:23:03  <Itkovian> Sure, I know, I am the other west-flemish guy teaching CA practica
2010-09-30T15:23:10  * boegel isn't sure how that all works now
2010-09-30T15:23:11  <Itkovian> the tallest one :-)
2010-09-30T15:23:42  <Migi32> or... ?
2010-09-30T15:24:33  <Migi32> ah yes, I'm ir, second year I can choose between electronics, building (I don't know the English names for these), and CS
2010-09-30T15:25:08  <Itkovian> construction, I suppose
2010-09-30T15:25:14  <boegel> Migi32: building -> construction? civil?
2010-09-30T15:25:22  <Migi32> yea, but there are more
2010-09-30T15:25:30  <Migi32> chemistry
2010-09-30T15:25:46  <Itkovian> physics
2010-09-30T15:25:56  <Migi32> mechanical engineering
2010-09-30T15:26:26  <boegel> Migi32: anyway, glad to see more UGent people are active on this
2010-09-30T15:26:33  <boegel> Migi32: but erm, you're using C++?
2010-09-30T15:26:45  <Migi32> what's wrong with it?
2010-09-30T15:26:51  <Migi32> careful with your words now ;)
2010-09-30T15:26:53  <boegel> Migi32: try visiting the GhentFPG meeting next Thursday, we'll convince you :)
2010-09-30T15:27:03  <Migi32> to what language?

2010-09-30T15:28:14  <boegel> Migi32: Haskell, for example
2010-09-30T15:28:23  <boegel> which is what I'm using
2010-09-30T15:28:28  <boegel> and I'm in front of you :P
2010-09-30T15:28:30  <Migi32> c++ has fp libraries
2010-09-30T15:28:45  <boegel> that's not real fp
2010-09-30T15:28:51  <boegel> that's just messing about
2010-09-30T15:28:56  <boegel> C++ isn't ment to do FP in
2010-09-30T15:28:59  <Migi32> you know what I might just come to your next meeting
2010-09-30T15:29:04  <bartwe> har
2010-09-30T15:29:16  <Migi32> I never really got why FP is so useful
2010-09-30T15:29:31  <Migi32> and if you're used to "normal" programming FP is really weird

2010-09-30T15:29:50  <bartwe> fp is something to learn, like prolog and scheme
2010-09-30T15:30:02  <boegel> Migi32: so visit GhentFPG
2010-09-30T15:30:12  <boegel> Migi32: or BelHac, in November (Google it)
2010-09-30T15:30:35  <boegel> Migi32: GhentFPG might scare you, because it has very high level talks too
2010-09-30T15:30:44  <boegel> Migi32: but BelHac will have introductory sessions
2010-09-30T15:31:27  <Migi32> no high level talks would be great. I might not get everything but I'm bored at most classes now because most are just too easy
2010-09-30T15:32:23  <Migi32> and I'm sure most people in this channel are
2010-09-30T15:33:44  <bartwe> try to focus on still studying while bored
2010-09-30T15:34:05  <bartwe> in the end i dropped out of univerisity, being bored in class didn't help
2010-09-30T15:34:23  <bartwe> not doing homework helped alout less
2010-09-30T15:35:35  <jmcarthur> i had a really bad uni experience
2010-09-30T15:35:43  <jmcarthur> didn't feel like i got anything out of it
2010-09-30T15:35:50  <jmcarthur> was just a lot of money and work for not much reward
2010-09-30T15:36:19  <bartwe> hmz, i think i got alot out of it, just no papers
2010-09-30T15:36:32  <jmcarthur> i learned very little
2010-09-30T15:36:38  <jmcarthur> learned a lot more on my own
2010-09-30T15:36:47  <bartwe> yep, that happens
2010-09-30T15:37:05  <jmcarthur> and i didn't feel that my uni was very pro-intellectual
2010-09-30T15:37:21  <Itkovian> jmcarthur: in belgium uni is fairly cheap to attend.
2010-09-30T15:37:30  <Itkovian> so money is usually not an issue here
2010-09-30T15:37:44  <jmcarthur> money wasn't really an issue for me either, but it still cost a lot
2010-09-30T15:38:09  <bartwe> meh i had the feeling university fails to look beyond phd/tenure related business
2010-09-30T15:38:57  <Bobng> I'm scared of going to uni.
2010-09-30T15:39:04  <Bobng> I will be older than most if I do go

2010-09-30T15:39:21  <Bobng> by several years, plus I don't know if I am clever enough to do computer science
2010-09-30T15:39:24  <Bobng> or software design.
2010-09-30T15:39:55  <Itkovian> Bobng: it just takes hard work. Study and you'll likely make it.
2010-09-30T15:40:43  <Bobng> The problem is I love programming, but I dislike the rest that goes with it - testing, design and evaluation
2010-09-30T15:41:13  <Bobng> so i keep thinking I ought to go freelancer or something, as opposed to learning - and possibly failing a course which contains a lot of that
2010-09-30T15:41:31  <jmcarthur> bartwe: my uni mostly focused on the "job market"
2010-09-30T15:41:41  <jmcarthur> and i hated that
2010-09-30T15:41:55  <jmcarthur> i wanted to actually learn something, not just the bare minimum to get hired
2010-09-30T15:42:19  <Bobng> Did you end up getting hired though?
2010-09-30T15:42:32  <Migi32> jmcarthur, oh no don't worry about me I'm getting about 80% average score

2010-09-30T15:43:31  <Bobng> what degree did you take, out of interest?
2010-09-30T15:43:35  <jmcarthur> computer science
2010-09-30T15:43:44  <jmcarthur> it would have been better at a different uni i'm sure
2010-09-30T15:43:47  <Bobng> and you think it is worthless?
2010-09-30T15:43:53  <jmcarthur> mine was focusing more on software engineering
2010-09-30T15:43:59  <Bobng> Ahh, what uni did you go to? I'm looking at different ones right now
2010-09-30T15:44:19  <jmcarthur> yeah, i didn't feel like i got anything out of it beyond a tick for my resume
2010-09-30T15:44:30  <jmcarthur> Bobng: university of alabama in huntsville
2010-09-30T15:44:33  <Itkovian> Bobng: Right, but that comes with the territory. There are many pittfalls.
2010-09-30T15:44:48  <jmcarthur> Bobng: great for engineering and "real world" stuff, not so great for learning beyond what is necessary
2010-09-30T15:44:58  <Bobng> ahh
2010-09-30T15:45:35  <jmcarthur> UAH is known by some as the "MIT of the South" .... i don't think so
2010-09-30T15:46:05  <jmcarthur> but then, i didn't go through the whole engineering program, which i know is actually pretty good
2010-09-30T15:46:17  <jmcarthur> the CS department just suffers

2010-09-30T15:48:53  <yasith> would be great if anyone can give an insight to it
2010-09-30T15:49:42  <BtbN> you forgot to compile the ui-file
2010-09-30T15:49:50  <BtbN> which qmake should normaly auto-built into the Makefile
2010-09-30T15:50:21  <BtbN> and QLineEdit should be included it it's used...
2010-09-30T15:50:23  <BtbN> *if
2010-09-30T15:50:31  <BtbN> but this should get fixed by the ui-file
2010-09-30T15:50:40  <yasith> Um, I haven't had any experience with compiling Qt stuff before
2010-09-30T15:50:49  <yasith> I ran qmake PlanetWarrior.pro
2010-09-30T15:50:52  <yasith> and then, make
2010-09-30T15:51:01  <BtbN> yep, that's it
2010-09-30T15:51:02  <yasith> how do I compile the ui-file ?
2010-09-30T15:51:17  <BtbN> qmake includes this step into the Makefile
2010-09-30T15:51:22  <BtbN> if it does not, your qt-install is broken

2010-09-30T18:29:38  <jmcarthur> not trying to get you to work hard and give me an awesome list or anything. just wondering if you have any areas in particular to suggest

2010-09-30T19:31:51  <Cyndre> whats your basic strategy?
2010-09-30T19:32:04  <Cyndre> maybe I can give you something you can implement better then me
2010-09-30T19:32:19  <bhasker> heuristic to order planets in terms of desirability
2010-09-30T19:32:21  <bhasker> followed by
2010-09-30T19:32:28  <bhasker> identifying how much each planet can spare
2010-09-30T19:32:43  <bhasker> based on how many fleets are incoming etc, and how many enemy planets are nearby etc
2010-09-30T19:32:51  <bhasker> and how far the planet is from the nearest enemy planet
2010-09-30T19:32:51  <Cyndre> based on how close you are to the nearest enemy planet and the growth of said enemy planet?
2010-09-30T19:32:56  <bhasker> yup
2010-09-30T19:33:22  <Cyndre> do you have anything that says - hey Im ahead attack?
2010-09-30T19:33:23  <bhasker> then split my list of planets 3 ways
2010-09-30T19:33:38  <bhasker> well i have stuff like i am not ahead ...don't waste ships

2010-09-30T19:33:47  <Cyndre> do you scan for planets you can take for 2 ships?
2010-09-30T19:33:50  <bhasker> nope

2010-09-30T19:33:59  <bhasker> i should i guess lol
2010-09-30T19:34:00  <Cyndre> its called the sucker punch
2010-09-30T19:34:10  <bhasker> but i would expect that to emerge from heuristics
2010-09-30T19:34:15  <Cyndre> scan for new enemy fleets where you can land 1 - 3 turns after they land
2010-09-30T19:34:20  <bhasker> that a cheap planet will automatically bubble tot he top
2010-09-30T19:34:24  <Cyndre> no no
2010-09-30T19:34:34  <bhasker> yea so i do that
2010-09-30T19:34:43  <Cyndre> neutral 50 ship planet - enemy sends 51 ships - I see that, so I send 2 ships to land 1 turn after them
2010-09-30T19:34:52  <Cyndre> 2 + planetGrowth actually
2010-09-30T19:34:57  <bhasker> basically for each target, i figure out given current status after x turns
2010-09-30T19:35:12  <bhasker> and figure out how many ships i need to take it if the enemy gets it at x turn
2010-09-30T19:36:02  <bhasker> etc
2010-09-30T19:36:26  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5078062 turn 11 you can see one oppurtunity
2010-09-30T19:36:39  <Cyndre> your 6 planet should have dispatched 5 ships to the 23 planet
2010-09-30T19:37:29  <bhasker> yea actually i have a bug in the way i calculate ships required
2010-09-30T19:37:34  <Cyndre> turn 19 your 7 ship planet in the bottom right should have dipsatched 2 ships to the 6 planet
2010-09-30T19:37:48  <bhasker> yea i am rewriting that piece of the code
2010-09-30T19:37:48  <Cyndre> fix that you will be top 25
2010-09-30T19:37:50  <bhasker> to work correctly

2010-09-30T19:42:35  <Cyndre> the current one thats ranked 300
2010-09-30T19:42:41  <Jahnson> cool

2010-09-30T19:42:52  <Jahnson> lol
2010-09-30T19:43:00  <Cyndre> it was better before and I added so much I cant remember what it was before
2010-09-30T19:43:19  <jesionaj> shoulda used some version control!
2010-09-30T19:43:28  <bhasker> heh i am using version control now
2010-09-30T19:43:28  <jesionaj> also i should take my own advice
2010-09-30T19:43:34  <Cyndre> used to be ranked 100 - 200, now 300 - 400 (tried to add state and really fucked me and my bot up) so rewritting
2010-09-30T19:43:36  <bhasker> the problem though is remembering which change worked
2010-09-30T19:43:38  <bhasker> ^
2010-09-30T19:43:41  <bhasker> i should have a change log
2010-09-30T19:43:44  <bhasker> and track the changes i make

2010-09-30T19:44:28  <bhasker> makes for cleaner log lines

2010-09-30T19:45:08  <Cyndre> then they can teach me version control - unless someone can help me out with that - version/source control
2010-09-30T19:45:21  <bhasker> version control is pretty simple
2010-09-30T19:45:26  <bhasker> what OS do you have?
2010-09-30T19:45:31  <bhasker> mac/windows ?
2010-09-30T19:45:32  <Cyndre> I use windows
2010-09-30T19:45:40  <bhasker> k go download subversion
2010-09-30T19:45:44  <Cyndre> I feel dirty saying it though - does that make it okay?
2010-09-30T19:45:53  <bhasker> type svnadmin create myrepo

2010-09-30T19:46:34  <bhasker> then create
2010-09-30T19:46:38  <jesionaj> the builtin logging in python is awesome
2010-09-30T19:46:57  <bhasker> yea i realized that after i had put a bunch of print statements everywhere
2010-09-30T19:47:01  <bhasker> so have to switch to it
2010-09-30T19:47:26  <Cyndre> SilkSVN?  - SlikSVN (32- and 64-bit client MSI; maintained by Bert Huijben, SharpSvn project)'
2010-09-30T19:47:45  <bhasker> yea that would work

2010-09-30T19:49:19  <bhasker> add your files
2010-09-30T19:49:21  <bhasker> check it back in

2010-09-30T19:49:38  <bhasker> that way its like your private repo

2010-09-30T19:50:06  <Jahnson> cool thanks ill check
2010-09-30T19:50:09  <bhasker> putting it on code.google.com is probably the easiest
2010-09-30T19:50:28  <bhasker> no need to setup svn on your machine etc and its all safe on some other server in google's data center
2010-09-30T19:50:34  <bhasker> just download an svn client

2010-09-30T20:06:37  <bhasker> just pick any license you want but keep the repository private
2010-09-30T20:06:51  <bhasker> unless you want to share your code
2010-09-30T20:07:09  <bhasker> in which case pick a license that reserves all rights
2010-09-30T20:13:14  <Cyndre> oh my, how did I lose this game - http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5091005
2010-09-30T20:13:54  <bhasker> which one is your bot?
2010-09-30T20:14:00  <bhasker> nm the red one
2010-09-30T20:14:01  <Cyndre> adamdomoney
2010-09-30T20:14:04  <sigh> the one that lost :P
2010-09-30T20:14:11  <bhasker> oh
2010-09-30T20:14:19  <bhasker> you lost on ship count
2010-09-30T20:14:20  <bhasker> i think
2010-09-30T20:14:23  <bhasker> at turn 200
2010-09-30T20:14:31  <Cyndre> but look at how far ahead I was
2010-09-30T20:14:40  <bhasker> well your bot spreads itself out
2010-09-30T20:14:44  <Cyndre> my bot loses like that alot
2010-09-30T20:14:47  <bhasker> you never consistently attacked anything
2010-09-30T20:14:54  <bhasker> your ships were all over the place
2010-09-30T20:15:01  <bhasker> and you never took control of anything
2010-09-30T20:15:23  <Cyndre> most games I was ahead then dived (the ones I lost)
2010-09-30T20:15:46  <bhasker> your mid game should be to channel ships to one place
2010-09-30T20:15:49  <sigh> I think towards the end blue just had more planets, and better growth
2010-09-30T20:15:53  <bhasker> yes
2010-09-30T20:16:06  <Cyndre> sigh: yea, but I had the ships it should have attacked
2010-09-30T20:16:06  <bhasker> most of the bots you will see tend to go after one planet at a time
2010-09-30T20:16:21  <sigh> Cyndre: yeah, you attacked too slow
2010-09-30T20:16:26  <sigh> which only wore your down
2010-09-30T20:16:36  <bhasker> and you completely ignored the middle once you lost it
2010-09-30T20:16:37  <Cyndre> and I constantly leave them with 0 ships
2010-09-30T20:16:42  <sigh> if you have high ships, low growth, need to attack fast
2010-09-30T20:16:55  <bhasker> you kept going after his planets at the back
2010-09-30T20:17:03  <bhasker> which are farther away and easier to reinforce for him
2010-09-30T20:17:09  <bhasker> the more time you travel
2010-09-30T20:17:10  <sigh> (I don't do anything nearly that smart, so take what I say with a grain of salt)
2010-09-30T20:17:19  <bhasker> more time he has to reinforce
2010-09-30T20:17:23  <bhasker> long trips are not good
2010-09-30T20:17:36  <bhasker> try to attack planets closer to you
2010-09-30T20:17:43  <Cyndre> yea, been thinking of that
2010-09-30T20:17:56  <Cyndre> trying to find all the bad things so I dont do them in the rewrite
2010-09-30T20:18:16  <bhasker> well one thing i do which maybe useful is use average distances to go for planets that are closer to your planets
2010-09-30T20:18:36  <bhasker> my bot tends to prefer planets closer to my other planets
2010-09-30T20:18:47  <bhasker> so if there is no enemy nearby it will keep taking over neutrals
2010-09-30T20:18:50  <Cyndre> yea, I was playing with my shipCost, planetGrowth, turnsToTake calculation
2010-09-30T20:18:57  <sigh> not so sure about using average distances, myself
2010-09-30T20:19:04  <bhasker> sigh it works well mostly
2010-09-30T20:19:10  <sigh> fair enough
2010-09-30T20:19:21  <bhasker> except when there are maps where starting planets are closeby
2010-09-30T20:19:28  <bhasker> then averages throws you off
2010-09-30T20:19:30  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T20:19:42  <bhasker> cause everything is almost as close to your planets as its to enemy
2010-09-30T20:19:43  <Cyndre> and I used to have - shipCost - ((turnsToTakeFarthestPlanet - turnsToTakeThisPlanet) * targetPlanetsGrowthRate)
2010-09-30T20:19:58  <sigh> bhasker: what does your bot do on map30 vs ragebot?
2010-09-30T20:20:04  <bhasker> let me test it
2010-09-30T20:20:48  <Cyndre> sigh - bhasker already has the calculations for checking for avaliable ships based on nearby planets
2010-09-30T20:21:18  <sigh> Cyndre: sure, but that is defense
2010-09-30T20:21:21  <bhasker> my bot does the right thing
2010-09-30T20:21:24  <bhasker> acquires the size 20 planet
2010-09-30T20:21:24  <sigh> we are talking about attack :P
2010-09-30T20:21:28  <sigh> cool
2010-09-30T20:21:29  <bhasker> at the corner
2010-09-30T20:21:32  <bhasker> then just sits
2010-09-30T20:21:32  <sigh> yup
2010-09-30T20:21:39  <bhasker> and builds ships
2010-09-30T20:21:42  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T20:21:46  <bhasker> and kills rage when it has enough
2010-09-30T20:22:07  <bhasker> my bot has ragebot pretty much beaten on every map
2010-09-30T20:22:13  <bhasker> ragebot is simple to beat
2010-09-30T20:22:17  <Cyndre> Im missing 3 maps
2010-09-30T20:22:18  <Cyndre> or 2
2010-09-30T20:22:31  <bhasker> i think my bot loses on planet24
2010-09-30T20:22:33  <bhasker> oops map24
2010-09-30T20:22:35  <bhasker> or something
2010-09-30T20:22:39  <sigh> not that simple, yestderday ragebot beat dmj1.8 and McLeopold6 on tcp :P
2010-09-30T20:22:57  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-30T20:23:10  <bhasker> well unless you have some weird bug, ragebot is very simple to beat
2010-09-30T20:23:12  <Cyndre> map 22 is bad
2010-09-30T20:23:39  <Naktibalda> what's bad about it?
2010-09-30T20:23:47  <sigh> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=239210
2010-09-30T20:23:52  <Cyndre> ragebot beats me up on it
2010-09-30T20:23:55  <sigh> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=236157
2010-09-30T20:24:03  <sigh> just to make you guys feel better :P
2010-09-30T20:24:04  <justin_pdx> It is so amusing that ragebot is a worthy challenge in various circumstances.
2010-09-30T20:24:06  <bhasker> easy to beat on map 22 capture the 24 size planet
2010-09-30T20:24:13  <bhasker> right next to you
2010-09-30T20:24:25  <bhasker> for ragebot the best heuristic is
2010-09-30T20:24:28  <bhasker> at start
2010-09-30T20:24:34  <Cyndre> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=Cyndre   bah
2010-09-30T20:24:35  <bhasker> num_ships you can send out
2010-09-30T20:24:53  <sigh> Cyndre: what's wrong?
2010-09-30T20:24:58  <bhasker> == planet.GrowthRate()*dist_to_rage_planet
2010-09-30T20:25:07  <Naktibalda> yes, it's strange that dmj doesn't use it
2010-09-30T20:25:07  <bhasker> do not send more than that
2010-09-30T20:25:10  <Cyndre> I win this map, lose that map etc
2010-09-30T20:25:16  <Cyndre> against same people
2010-09-30T20:25:17  <bhasker> as long as you follow that rule
2010-09-30T20:25:24  <bhasker> you are pretty much guaranteed to beat ragebot
2010-09-30T20:25:30  <FlagCapper> I don't think beating ragebot is that important
2010-09-30T20:25:41  <bhasker> and thats generally a good starting planet rule
2010-09-30T20:25:42  <sigh> not sure, they might be playing around with more aggressive tactics
2010-09-30T20:25:56  <FlagCapper> So dmj and others probably don't focus on it
2010-09-30T20:26:00  <sigh> it's not like your normal opponent plays like ragebot
2010-09-30T20:26:01  <Cyndre> bhasker: just remember - part of being awsome is not knowing how awsome you are - ragebot was a challenge for me and alot of others
2010-09-30T20:26:12  <bhasker> it was a challenge for me too
2010-09-30T20:26:18  <bhasker> took me sometime to figure out the formula
2010-09-30T20:26:23  <sigh> still, know *how* to beat ragebot is very important
2010-09-30T20:26:23  <bhasker> i would get stomped over by it at start
2010-09-30T20:26:29  <sigh> and trust me, both of them know how to
2010-09-30T20:26:52  <bhasker> actually i would say beating ragebot on all maps will make your bot much better
2010-09-30T20:26:56  <Cyndre> and on map 30 would the best stategy be to send half ships to each of the far 20 planets?
2010-09-30T20:27:00  <FlagCapper> Well you just have to make sure you have enough growth to fend off the next attack
2010-09-30T20:27:11  <FlagCapper> And capture another planet
2010-09-30T20:27:16  <sigh> bhasker: if your bot wasn't doing so before, sure
2010-09-30T20:27:19  <bhasker> cyndre your first planet no matter what should only send out the following number of ships
2010-09-30T20:27:30  <bhasker> distance to enemy planet * growthRate()
2010-09-30T20:27:32  <bhasker> thats it
2010-09-30T20:27:33  <Cyndre> oh yea
2010-09-30T20:27:35  <bhasker> nothing more
2010-09-30T20:27:37  <bhasker> nothing less
2010-09-30T20:27:43  <bhasker> if you send that out
2010-09-30T20:27:45  <sigh> but as your games get more competitive, every ship counts, and having ships locked up can hinder progress
2010-09-30T20:28:00  <bhasker> you can be sure that if enemy sent all 100 against you
2010-09-30T20:28:05  <bhasker> you will still retain control with 0 ships
2010-09-30T20:28:19  <Cyndre> yea, me and sigh were talking about that yesterday
2010-09-30T20:28:22  <bhasker> after that the strategy evolves into a heuristic
2010-09-30T20:28:35  <bhasker> where you need to account for how many planets with how much ships are around you
2010-09-30T20:28:35  <sigh> I was saying what now?
2010-09-30T20:28:36  <bhasker> etc
2010-09-30T20:28:59  <Cyndre> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=248284     I celebrate when I beat a1k0n
2010-09-30T20:29:03  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T20:29:51  <sigh> despite all this - and I can't stress this enough - don't get bogged down by the details... fix one problem at a time
2010-09-30T20:30:10  <bhasker> yup i keep throwing complicated stuff out
2010-09-30T20:30:21  <bhasker> i replaced my heuristic for deciding best planets with a simple one
2010-09-30T20:30:23  <sigh> e.g. beat ragebot first... after that you can worry about if that is the most efficient way to go
2010-09-30T20:30:25  <bhasker> and my bot actually does better
2010-09-30T20:30:30  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T20:30:39  <bhasker> complicated heuristics are difficult to debug
2010-09-30T20:30:50  <sigh> my planet evaluation heuristic hasn't changed much from day 1
2010-09-30T20:30:52  <bhasker> and i wrote a script that takes a state and prints out my calculated values
2010-09-30T20:31:07  <sigh> just what I do with it, and the predictions have gotten better
2010-09-30T20:31:18  <bhasker> yup
2010-09-30T20:31:27  <sigh> bhasker: my bot logs all that stuff every turn
2010-09-30T20:31:33  <bhasker> yes mine does that too
2010-09-30T20:31:38  <bhasker> but its easier to just run one state
2010-09-30T20:31:53  <sigh> sure... I probably should do that too
2010-09-30T20:31:55  <bhasker> rather than run through the game and hunt through log lines
2010-09-30T20:31:59  <Cyndre> Im thinking of changing to a reaction bot, and only reacting 1 turn behind the enemy and just countering moves where possible, or evening out growthRate when its not possible to counter attack the enemy
2010-09-30T20:32:08  <bhasker> cyndre thats a losing strategy
2010-09-30T20:32:09  <bhasker> usually
2010-09-30T20:32:17  <bhasker> works on close maps
2010-09-30T20:32:26  <bhasker> on big maps the other bot will outgrow you
2010-09-30T20:32:44  <Cyndre> at most 100 more ships at the end
2010-09-30T20:32:54  <bhasker> hmm not true
2010-09-30T20:32:59  <sigh> Zannick made a copybot
2010-09-30T20:33:02  <Cyndre> if you cant counter, you make the exact asymetrical move and gain szame growth rate
2010-09-30T20:33:18  <Cyndre> bhasker: giving your enemy only 1 turn of growth per planet
2010-09-30T20:33:21  <bhasker> yes but how will you win?
2010-09-30T20:33:27  <Cyndre> when you can counter them
2010-09-30T20:33:31  <bhasker> you will always be behind?
2010-09-30T20:34:14  <Cyndre> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=248229  watch turn 10 and 11
2010-09-30T20:35:21  <Cyndre> one good attack = 2x enemy ships sucker punched
2010-09-30T20:35:45  <bhasker> works on close planets, as i said, on planets where you are far away you can't counter
2010-09-30T20:35:56  <bhasker> and his growth will eventually outpace you
2010-09-30T20:36:02  <Cyndre> so say the planet you attack has 50 neutral ships and you steal it on the enemy 3 turns after them and it has a growth of 15 - you gained 70 ships
2010-09-30T20:36:20  <Cyndre> bhasker: your 1 turn behind and copy moves when you cant take the planet
2010-09-30T20:36:34  *** smellyhippy <smellyhippy!~asmodean@about/csharp/regular/smellyhippy> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2010-09-30T20:36:52  <bhasker> but at some point won't he be like #of planets*(respective growthrates) ahead
2010-09-30T20:36:59  <bhasker> and if he has all of them piled at one place
2010-09-30T20:37:09  <bhasker> he can attack with that many more ships
2010-09-30T20:37:15  <bhasker> and you will lose a planet
2010-09-30T20:37:20  <Cyndre> no, because you copy moves
2010-09-30T20:37:30  <bhasker> actually let me implement that
2010-09-30T20:37:35  <bhasker> and see if that works
2010-09-30T20:37:42  <bhasker> so you are saying that it will be a draw?
2010-09-30T20:37:42  <Naktibalda> nah, let Cyndre implement it
2010-09-30T20:37:43  <Cyndre> ie - he sends 50 ships to planet you cant beat him to, you copy it
2010-09-30T20:37:53  <Cyndre> naktibalda I have it implemented, well part of it
2010-09-30T20:37:59  <bhasker> what if that 50 is coming against your planet?
2010-09-30T20:37:59  <sigh> wont be a draw, copybot will always be a few ships behind
2010-09-30T20:38:00  <Naktibalda> so it sucks
2010-09-30T20:38:08  <Cyndre> then send 50 against his planet
2010-09-30T20:38:12  <sigh> unless player 1 is stupid and takes center
2010-09-30T20:38:16  <Naktibalda> everybody tries to takeover neutrals
2010-09-30T20:38:32  <Cyndre> but thats the only reason my bots any good bhasker
2010-09-30T20:38:44  <Cyndre> other then that my bot blows worse then the $5 hooker
2010-09-30T20:39:00  <bhasker> i don't know i am not convinced that a copy bot can maintain balance
2010-09-30T20:39:28  <sigh> i need to implement one too

2010-09-30T20:39:55  <sigh> anyone care to implement one and open source it :D
2010-09-30T20:40:17  <Cyndre> your outputting logging with 2 spaces in it "attacking planet 6"  invalid output
2010-09-30T20:40:25  <sigh> Naktibalda: you should sanity check output, and log errors

2010-09-30T20:57:18  <Cyndre> dmj111 does your bot do something like thathttp://pastebin.com/tMvWcZSf
2010-09-30T20:57:27  <Cyndre> sorry http://pastebin.com/tMvWcZSf
2010-09-30T20:57:38  * dmj111 is looking ...

2010-09-30T20:58:39  <sigh> dmj111's code is more like (shipCostToTake - enemyShipsCostToTake) >= 100000000000000000
2010-09-30T20:58:42  <Cyndre> I seen a bug
2010-09-30T20:59:37  <dmj111> Cyndre: is there a specific part you are asking about?
2010-09-30T21:00:03  <Cyndre> snatching the planet out from under the enemys fleets
2010-09-30T21:02:08  <dmj111> ahh..  there is a slight bug there in mine, but basically, I predict the future for all planets.  If the enemy takes a neutral, I treat it as an enemy planet, and try to take it the turn after they do.
2010-09-30T21:02:23  <sigh> yeah, I do something similar
2010-09-30T21:02:41  <dmj111> maybe not bug, but I oversimplify in some cases.
2010-09-30T21:02:48  <sigh> dmj111: does your bot every take a neutral that has an enemy heading to it if it is favorable?
2010-09-30T21:03:08  <sigh> ie, before the enemy
2010-09-30T21:03:28  <Cyndre> umm, it said I crashed do timingout or not starting
2010-09-30T21:03:46  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3911   my first game
2010-09-30T21:04:14  <dmj111> mine tries to take anything it thinks is favorable, until it runs out of ships or time.
2010-09-30T21:04:16  <sigh> Cyndre: I only see two wins for you
2010-09-30T21:04:19  <Cyndre> on the visualizer it blames me but gets the win correct

2010-09-30T21:05:16  <sigh> oh, visualiser show game result now!
2010-09-30T21:06:20  <Cyndre> dmj111: and the bug is the correction for * -1 or did you see a different one?
2010-09-30T21:06:50  <sigh> hmmm... data in the visualiser js shows the correct winner
2010-09-30T21:06:59  <sigh> wonder why the visualiser is ignoring it
2010-09-30T21:07:43  <dmj111> Cyndre: bug in my code... I am a little too distracted to debug yours :)
2010-09-30T21:07:52  <Cyndre> dont blame you
2010-09-30T21:08:01  <Cyndre> I think I fixed a non bug :(

2010-09-30T21:59:59  <FlagCapper> dmj dethroned I see D:
2010-09-30T22:00:30  <Zannick> a fair while ago
2010-09-30T22:00:39  <FlagCapper> Ah
2010-09-30T22:00:46  <Jahnson> the rise of Belarus
2010-09-30T22:00:59  <FlagCapper> He's beating everyone by a good 100 points
2010-09-30T22:01:08  <FlagCapper> Pretty impressive.
2010-09-30T22:03:08  <sigh> dmj was that far ahead about 2 days ago :P
2010-09-30T22:03:37  <FlagCapper> And McLeopold before that
2010-09-30T22:03:42  <sigh> yup
2010-09-30T22:03:51  <FlagCapper> It's funny watching the old bots fall on the tcp server
2010-09-30T22:04:20  <sigh> adumlah and kcm1700 held top stop for a bit too, but not as clearly
2010-09-30T22:04:34  <FlagCapper> You're still up there though
2010-09-30T22:04:47  <FlagCapper> Do you keep resubmitting or is that the same one?
2010-09-30T22:04:56  <sigh> this one is a week old
2010-09-30T22:05:16  <sigh> it likes being in 7th
2010-09-30T22:05:41  <sigh> everyone else in the leaderboard swaps all the time, my bot just stays in the same place
2010-09-30T22:06:26  <FlagCapper> Do you have a better one yet?
2010-09-30T22:06:50  <sigh> I've got one that beats all pervious versions (including this one), but does worse overall
2010-09-30T22:06:57  <sigh> working on a better strategy
2010-09-30T22:07:33  <FlagCapper> Sometimes you just end up making a bot that plays on the weeknesses of your old one instead of playing better overall.
2010-09-30T22:07:59  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-30T22:09:03  <sigh> I've also spent a bit of time this week implementing some framework stuff that doesn't directly contribute to strength
2010-09-30T22:09:13  <sigh> like moving stuff into config options
2010-09-30T22:09:46  <FlagCapper> A kind of interesting idea would be just to brute force the best possible config options, no idea if that would work.
2010-09-30T22:09:58  <sigh> yeah, I plan to do something like that
2010-09-30T22:10:34  <sigh> ideally I'd set up a continuous tournament at home using bayeselo, and feed bots with a many combinations of settings as possible in
2010-09-30T22:10:49  <sigh> promoting the best to tcp
2010-09-30T22:11:23  <FlagCapper> The problem with that is you might just end up with bots that are really good against your bots, and not against others.
2010-09-30T22:11:46  <sigh> yeah, that would be the point of trialing them on tcp
2010-09-30T22:11:57  <FlagCapper> Yup
2010-09-30T22:12:00  <sigh> also, I hope to implement a variety of strategies
2010-09-30T22:12:08  <sigh> so hopefully they don't all act the same :)
2010-09-30T22:12:56  <sigh> already I can make my bots act quite differently by changing a few options
2010-09-30T22:13:33  <FlagCapper> Sounds good :)
2010-09-30T22:13:41  <sigh> every so often I see my bot do something which reminds me of other bots, and I get an idea of what other people are doing :)
2010-09-30T22:14:12  <FlagCapper> I just try to implement everything everyone else is doing and decide when to use what
2010-09-30T22:14:31  <sigh> yeah... but the problem is figuring out what they have implemented :)
2010-09-30T22:14:39  <FlagCapper> Well, some are kind of obvious
2010-09-30T22:14:54  <FlagCapper> Like the buildup into toss a whole ton of ships at a planet thing that adumlah does
2010-09-30T22:15:02  <sigh> yeah :)
2010-09-30T22:15:08  <sigh> yeah, but mostly I've found that speculation doesn't often match up with reality
2010-09-30T22:15:34  <sigh> just reading on the forum and channel about how people think other bots work, vs what they actually do
2010-09-30T22:15:48  <sigh> people think the top bots are a lot more sophisticated than they actually are
2010-09-30T22:17:50  <FlagCapper> Yeah
2010-09-30T22:18:09  <FlagCapper> Does your bot ever crash on the first turn on the main server?
2010-09-30T22:18:43  <sigh> it has a few times, but I think it was the server's fault... it hasn't happened to my latest submission
2010-09-30T22:19:01  <FlagCapper> I'm blaming the server too, but's it getting annoying.
2010-09-30T22:19:06  <sigh> yeah :(
2010-09-30T22:19:17  <sigh> do you use most of your time?
2010-09-30T22:19:25  <FlagCapper> I have my bot set to take up 1/40th of a second
2010-09-30T22:19:33  <FlagCapper> It never timeouts on my computer
2010-09-30T22:19:45  <sigh> yup, I'm in a similar boat
2010-09-30T22:20:06  <FlagCapper> And on the first turn no less, no idea how that could happen

2010-09-30T22:20:15  <FlagCapper> When there's a lot of ships it works just fine
2010-09-30T22:20:20  <Sylph> but while doing java it never timed ou
2010-09-30T22:20:23  <sigh> FlagCapper: where is your bot? I recall it being near the top, but I can't find it now
2010-09-30T22:20:27  <Sylph> you got nothing that's turn 1 only, FlagCapper ? :/
2010-09-30T22:20:30  <FlagCapper> I resubmitted

2010-09-30T22:21:08  <FlagCapper> Thanks
2010-09-30T22:21:17  <sigh> my current submission got a loss on its second game :P
2010-09-30T22:21:18  <Sylph> btw, decided to stick with C#, sigh
2010-09-30T22:21:23  <Sylph> and just be patient about them
2010-09-30T22:21:28  <Sylph> I'm tired rewriting my codes between languages
2010-09-30T22:21:34  <sigh> Sylph: cool, have you got a working submission up?
2010-09-30T22:21:38  <Sylph> no
2010-09-30T22:21:39  <FlagCapper> I got to 10th by half luck yesterday
2010-09-30T22:21:40  <Jahnson> why would c# be inferior?
2010-09-30T22:21:42  <Sylph> submitted my old java one
2010-09-30T22:21:49  <FlagCapper> And then fell to ~50th
2010-09-30T22:21:51  <Sylph> Because you get 1 submission succeeded out of 10, Jahnson
2010-09-30T22:21:54  <sigh> i see
2010-09-30T22:21:58  <Sylph> Server version borked
2010-09-30T22:22:24  <Sylph> same file, one succeed out of many... some dumb memory leak or something from the mono version they use.
2010-09-30T22:22:34  <Jahnson> huh? theres a limit on uploads?
2010-09-30T22:22:51  <Sylph> no, the version they got is just bugged
2010-09-30T22:22:58  <Jahnson> oh i see
2010-09-30T22:22:59  <Sylph> its on the tech forum
2010-09-30T22:23:06  <Sylph> IF they fix it, C# will work
2010-09-30T22:23:23  <Sylph> but i mean c++ is still going to be the fastest,
2010-09-30T22:23:27  <Jahnson> guys think PHP slowness would be significant?
2010-09-30T22:23:38  <FlagCapper> Python seems to work fine, so no
2010-09-30T22:23:45  <FlagCapper> Speed isn't really an issue in this contest
2010-09-30T22:23:45  <Jahnson> cool
2010-09-30T22:23:47  <Sylph> python is much faster than php last i checked
2010-09-30T22:23:56  <sigh> they only have python 2.5 :(
2010-09-30T22:23:58  <Sylph> it can matter, when you check a lot of info
2010-09-30T22:24:03  <Sylph> true, sigh
2010-09-30T22:24:24  <Sylph> My bot pretty much project every possible moves to the end game :D
2010-09-30T22:24:26  <Sylph> just kidding
2010-09-30T22:24:30  <sigh> haha
2010-09-30T22:24:37  <Sylph> but that was close to the intention, anyway
2010-09-30T22:24:56  <sigh> if you could project every possible move to the next turn I would be impressed :P
2010-09-30T22:24:58  <Sylph> two more functions to do then i can finish the bot algorithms
2010-09-30T22:25:04  <Sylph> :p sigh
2010-09-30T22:25:10  <Sylph> Mine does something like that
2010-09-30T22:25:11  <Jahnson> you doin more of a brute force aproach Sylph?
2010-09-30T22:25:19  <Sylph> nah
2010-09-30T22:25:24  <Sylph> just less blind
2010-09-30T22:25:35  <Sylph> Much more inforemd
2010-09-30T22:26:03  <sigh> my bot is pretty much a greedy algorithm, just munches on teh yummiest planets
2010-09-30T22:26:31  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-30T22:26:33  <Sylph> fun
2010-09-30T22:26:37  <Sylph> mine too
2010-09-30T22:26:40  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T22:26:43  <FlagCapper> I think everyone does that
2010-09-30T22:26:43  <Sylph> the one that is not likely for the enemy to bug
2010-09-30T22:26:45  <Sylph> but its not coded yet
2010-09-30T22:26:57  <Sylph> still finishing last 2 vital functions on the framework
2010-09-30T22:26:58  <FlagCapper> Unless someone is going for all the 0-growth planets and I'm not aware of it
2010-09-30T22:27:01  <Sylph> before my bot can even play
2010-09-30T22:27:15  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T22:28:12  <sigh> FlagCapper: well what I mean is that my bot doesn't think about combinations of planets, just one planet at a time
2010-09-30T22:28:17  <Sylph> my bot might take a 0 growth planet if its a good place to attack/defend
2010-09-30T22:28:39  <sigh> so some combination of lesser planets might be better, but my bot just wants the best :)
2010-09-30T22:28:41  <Sylph> and nothing else particularly attractive to take. xd
2010-09-30T22:28:47  * Sylph nods at sigh
2010-09-30T22:28:51  <sigh> my bot ignores 0 growth
2010-09-30T22:28:57  * Sylph nods
2010-09-30T22:29:04  <Sylph> i might ignore it too i guess, unless its last planets
2010-09-30T22:29:12  <Sylph> but later
2010-09-30T22:29:13  <sigh> otherwise I have to be careful of div0 errors, and I cbf
2010-09-30T22:29:13  <Sylph> not there yet :/
2010-09-30T22:29:16  <Sylph> I got plans first
2010-09-30T22:29:20  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T22:29:37  <Sylph> I just do a  score == 0 ? bla bla bla : bla bla bla; xd
2010-09-30T22:29:41  <Sylph> growth
2010-09-30T22:29:42  <Sylph> i mean
2010-09-30T22:29:45  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T22:29:53  <FlagCapper> 5 1-growth planets are much harder to control effectively than 1 5-growth planet
2010-09-30T22:30:00  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-30T22:30:03  <FlagCapper> Plus, you have to pay the capture fee 5 times
2010-09-30T22:30:07  <Sylph> n
2010-09-30T22:30:08  <sigh> i've just got: if ( ! growth ) continue;
2010-09-30T22:30:09  <Sylph> on
2010-09-30T22:30:10  <Sylph> no
2010-09-30T22:30:16  <Sylph> bigger growth planet usually got much more units
2010-09-30T22:30:22  <Sylph> so you can just divide
2010-09-30T22:30:32  <Sylph> attackForce/growth kind of deal
2010-09-30T22:30:39  <Sylph> for score calculation
2010-09-30T22:30:48  <Sylph> that's what I'm doing anyway
2010-09-30T22:31:10  <sigh> FlagCapper: 5 1-growth planets give more flexibility, and are harder for your opponent to take
2010-09-30T22:31:12  <Sylph> as for harder to defend, it seems like that, but may not really matter
2010-09-30T22:31:16  <Sylph> yep @ sigh
2010-09-30T22:31:23  <Sylph> it's actually harder to take than to defend
2010-09-30T22:31:35  <sigh> easier to defend, imo
2010-09-30T22:31:38  <Sylph> they need to +5 units to attack, AND whatever else they need to send per planet

2010-09-30T22:31:46  <Sylph> to make sure you don't defend it since its likely near y our base
2010-09-30T22:31:55  <Sylph> defending, you get num of fleet + 0
2010-09-30T22:31:55  <FlagCapper> You can pick them off one at a time though
2010-09-30T22:31:57  <Sylph> no matter what
2010-09-30T22:32:05  <Sylph> true on picking, but it takes longer
2010-09-30T22:32:09  <Sylph> attacking 5 planets
2010-09-30T22:32:16  <FlagCapper> And if all the ships go to reinforce the other planets are left with barely any ships
2010-09-30T22:32:22  <FlagCapper> So changing targets is easy
2010-09-30T22:32:30  <Sylph> the fleet you sent can't change target
2010-09-30T22:32:37  <Sylph> if they can, please tell me your algorithms :D
2010-09-30T22:32:37  <FlagCapper> So it's really hard to control effectively
2010-09-30T22:32:39  <Sylph> in private
2010-09-30T22:32:41  <Sylph> :D

2010-09-30T23:15:49  <jmcarthur> easiest is not svn
2010-09-30T23:15:57  <Sylph> ?
2010-09-30T23:15:57  <jmcarthur> wow i was very scrolled up

2010-09-30T23:16:09  <Sylph> no one talking about svn, and svn is easy...
2010-09-30T23:16:29  <jmcarthur> once you know it, sure
2010-09-30T23:16:31  <Sylph> I got an svn server on my pc
2010-09-30T23:16:32  <Sylph> true
2010-09-30T23:16:36  <jmcarthur> (even then, overly complicated)
2010-09-30T23:16:38  <Sylph> I'm teaching people in my class some svn atm
2010-09-30T23:16:49  <Sylph> use ankhsvn if you use visual studio
2010-09-30T23:16:53  <Sylph> instant commit from it
2010-09-30T23:16:57  <Sylph> when you commit
2010-09-30T23:16:57  <jmcarthur> the major DVCSs all are much simpler, in my opinion
2010-09-30T23:17:16  <Sylph> but svn is major
2010-09-30T23:17:23  <jmcarthur> it's not a DVCS
2010-09-30T23:18:04  <amstan> git/hg ftw
2010-09-30T23:18:05  <Sylph> prefer stuff like git?
2010-09-30T23:18:06  <jmcarthur> i'm talking about git, mercurial, darcs
2010-09-30T23:18:08  <Sylph> i suppose
2010-09-30T23:18:14  <jmcarthur> darcs ftw
2010-09-30T23:18:16  <jmcarthur> :P
2010-09-30T23:18:21  <Sylph> but git got limited windows support. :/
2010-09-30T23:18:40  <Sylph> you need to go to command line, etc, no two click commit from visual studio. well, they got a crappy plugin i think
2010-09-30T23:18:41  <amstan> windows got limited support from most dev apps
2010-09-30T23:18:46  <jmcarthur> (insert tasteless comment about windows)
2010-09-30T23:18:54  <dmj111> even rcs was tolerable if that is all you had... but mercurial is super easy.  I won't diss anyone using  git/bzr/darcs either...
2010-09-30T23:18:55  <amstan> jmcarthur: beat you to it
2010-09-30T23:18:57  <Sylph> tortoisesvn and ankhsvn makes working with svn really easy
2010-09-30T23:19:08  <Sylph> on windows
2010-09-30T23:19:18  <jmcarthur> yeah, svn is one of the few i actually complain about
2010-09-30T23:19:32  <jmcarthur> i've used tortoise. i found is extremely clumsy
2010-09-30T23:19:50  <jmcarthur> *it
2010-09-30T23:20:04  <jmcarthur> most GUI wrappers are, IMO
2010-09-30T23:20:29  <Sylph> it can be a bit clumsy
2010-09-30T23:20:29  <jmcarthur> i much prefer the svn CLI
2010-09-30T23:20:33  <Sylph> but much better than git's xd
2010-09-30T23:20:34  <amstan> guis for these tools are... meh
2010-09-30T23:20:42  <amstan> they're the same argument as ide vs notepad
2010-09-30T23:20:53  <sigh> go notepad!
2010-09-30T23:21:00  <jmcarthur> no, git beats svn any day even if only because it's so hard to dig yourself into a hole with git
2010-09-30T23:21:01  <amstan> and by notepad i mean text editors
2010-09-30T23:21:03  <dmj111> that's why i'm in emacs now...
2010-09-30T23:21:06  <Sylph> you go notepad, I am happy with my intellisense and stuff. :p
2010-09-30T23:21:23  <jmcarthur> emacs ftw
2010-09-30T23:21:23  <amstan> jmcarthur: actually.. idk, first time i did git checkout i dig myself in a hole
2010-09-30T23:21:24  <Sylph> did use notepad++ for ruby i guess
2010-09-30T23:21:29  <amstan> jmcarthur: i had no idea on what branch i was
2010-09-30T23:21:42  <amstan> also.. why would anyone ever use git revert?
2010-09-30T23:21:43  <jmcarthur> amstan: at least you can correct whatever hole you dig yourself into :P
2010-09-30T23:21:48  <dmj111> almost pasted my bot code accidentally into the irc window the other day though...
2010-09-30T23:21:49  <Sylph> :p
2010-09-30T23:21:54  <wh1teside> +1 for notepad++
2010-09-30T23:21:55  <sigh> dmj111: using irc from emacs is taking it a bit far
2010-09-30T23:21:55  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T23:21:58  * wh1teside climbs back into his hole
2010-09-30T23:22:06  <Sylph> copy it now, dmj :p
2010-09-30T23:22:37  <Sylph> notepad++ is the best. IT should replace the dumb notepad on windows :)
2010-09-30T23:22:38  <jmcarthur> amstan: you would use revert when you have already made commits public that you shouldn't have
2010-09-30T23:23:01  <amstan> jmcarthur: but does won't do anything, you'll still have the commit, you'll just have a commit after undoing it
2010-09-30T23:23:18  <jmcarthur> amstan: yeah, and you can't do anything about that no matter what angle you look at it
2010-09-30T23:23:31  <jmcarthur> amstan: you can't just remove a public commit because somebody else may have already pulled it
2010-09-30T23:23:37  <jmcarthur> hence revert
2010-09-30T23:23:54  <amstan> what about git reset HEAD^1?
2010-09-30T23:24:02  <jmcarthur> only works if the commit isn't already public
2010-09-30T23:24:06  <amstan> ic
2010-09-30T23:24:10  <amstan> ok, makes sense
2010-09-30T23:24:17  <u1tr0n> i like Eclipce
2010-09-30T23:24:33  <u1tr0n> as code editor ;)
2010-09-30T23:24:38  <Sylph> i only use eclipse for php and java
2010-09-30T23:24:39  <amstan> u1tr0n: if someone would take eclipse away from you, would you still know how to compile your stuff?
2010-09-30T23:24:46  <Sylph> it works great for php and java :D
2010-09-30T23:24:57  <jmcarthur> i like eclipse as a way to use up my extra ram
2010-09-30T23:25:12  <Sylph> :p
2010-09-30T23:25:14  <Sylph> I got spare ram too
2010-09-30T23:25:17  <jmcarthur> it's like a paperweight, but for your computer
2010-09-30T23:25:17  <sigh> you have extra ram?
2010-09-30T23:25:18  <Sylph> 8Gb now, just upgraded
2010-09-30T23:25:22  <sigh> I want extra ram :(
2010-09-30T23:26:23  <davidjliu> heh, on a sidenote, all of the Americans in the top 10 are pythons, and all pythons in the top 10 are American...
2010-09-30T23:26:34  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T23:26:37  <Sylph> funny
2010-09-30T23:26:43  <u1tr0n> amstan: php dont need to compile but i can use even windows notepad...
2010-09-30T23:27:06  <amstan> u1tr0n: in that case..
2010-09-30T23:27:24  <sigh> all australians in the top 10 are me, and all me in the top 10 are australians!
2010-09-30T23:27:33  <amstan> i'm just saying.. i usually frown upon relying on an idea when one is clueless how to do stuff without it
2010-09-30T23:27:37  <dmj111> sigh: irc in emacs may be a bit far... even worse, I used to run an irc bot out of emacs.  hooked it up to the eliza command too.
2010-09-30T23:28:02  <Sylph> you're nuts, dmj :p
2010-09-30T23:28:05  <sigh> dmj111: when are you going to upgrade to a better os :P
2010-09-30T23:28:16  <dmj111> Sylph: posting my code probably won't do you much good before too long.
2010-09-30T23:28:23  <dmj111> sigh: there is a better os?
2010-09-30T23:28:25  <Sylph> probably
2010-09-30T23:28:32  <sigh> than emacs :D
2010-09-30T23:28:33  <Sylph> I got a very different approach than yours anyway :/
2010-09-30T23:28:37  <Sylph> which i'm working on
2010-09-30T23:28:44  <amstan> i want the post mortems already
2010-09-30T23:28:50  <sigh> who died?
2010-09-30T23:28:50  <amstan> i'm clueless on what ppl are doing yet
2010-09-30T23:29:00  <Sylph> ?
2010-09-30T23:29:02  <dmj111> i need to upgrade my computer... I think I am lucky emacs even runs on it.
2010-09-30T23:29:06  <amstan> i didn't have time to invest in a bot yet

2010-09-30T23:29:49  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T23:29:50  <amstan> and then there's always the temptation to comment about it
2010-09-30T23:30:52  <sigh> well, I've talked a lot about my bot in the channel if anyone's been listening :P

2010-09-30T23:33:09  <Sylph> >.>
2010-09-30T23:33:33  <jmcarthur> the exact evaluation order is only required to fit a few properties, but is not actually specified
2010-09-30T23:33:57  <amstan> oh man.. ubuntu coming out very soon
2010-09-30T23:33:59  <amstan> so excited
2010-09-30T23:34:36  <jmcarthur> that haskell is non-strict rather than lazy is what gives the compiler the freedom to cause expressions to evaluate in parallel and stuff
2010-09-30T23:35:17  <amstan> woah.. google analitics... tells me that there's a drop in traffic every weekend
2010-09-30T23:35:20  <jmcarthur> and in fact have the freedom to contort your code into machine code that barely resembles a more verbatim translation
2010-09-30T23:35:39  <jmcarthur> amstan: that's interesting
2010-09-30T23:35:40  <amstan> avg time on site is increasing, bounce rate decreasing

2010-09-30T23:36:04  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-09-30T23:36:09  <jmcarthur> i don't know
2010-09-30T23:36:21  <sigh> preferably something a beginner to haskell to could understand :)
2010-09-30T23:36:41  <amstan> and apparently chrome is at 50% of the traffic
2010-09-30T23:36:54  <amstan> what browsers do you guys use, quick show of hands
2010-09-30T23:37:02  <jmcarthur> sigh: i'm trying to think of something that discusses this point and can't think of anything
2010-09-30T23:37:07  <dmj111> chrome.  I might be the 50%....
2010-09-30T23:37:34  <amstan> apparently there was a bug in chrome that inflated the analytics numbers
2010-09-30T23:37:34  <sigh> jmcarthur: ok, no worries
2010-09-30T23:37:44  <amstan> but this does sound credible

2010-09-30T23:41:22  <jmcarthur> sigh: it's not a game changer when you're learning, but it's interesting from a programming language theory point of view
2010-09-30T23:41:46  <sigh> yeah, I like to understand how things work :)
2010-09-30T23:42:05  <jmcarthur> sigh: i guess knowing it in advance preempts any confusiong about parallel evaluation, but that's probably about it
2010-09-30T23:42:10  <jmcarthur> *confusion
2010-09-30T23:42:24  <sigh> i see
2010-09-30T23:42:36  <jmcarthur> it's not very confusing in the first place though
2010-09-30T23:43:03  <jmcarthur> what people usually find more confusing is the interplay between strictness and non-strictness
2010-09-30T23:43:05  <Sylph> interesting to hear that, jmcarthur
2010-09-30T23:43:12  <jmcarthur> and that's something i won't even try to get into right now :)
2010-09-30T23:43:14  <Sylph> i barely have any clue about functional programming :/
2010-09-30T23:43:16  <Sylph> if any
2010-09-30T23:43:27  <jmcarthur> Sylph: evaluation order isn't really specific to functional programming
2010-09-30T23:43:35  <jmcarthur> Sylph: C has some laziness, even
2010-09-30T23:43:35  * Sylph didn't read all i guess
2010-09-30T23:43:36  <Sylph>  hrm
2010-09-30T23:43:43  <jmcarthur> && and ||, for example
2010-09-30T23:43:47  <jmcarthur> or ?:
2010-09-30T23:44:02  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-30T23:44:27  <jmcarthur> && and || are lazy in their second arguments, and ?: is lazy in the second and third arguments
2010-09-30T23:44:30  <Sylph> I only know lazy evaluation in the coding, not in the core language
2010-09-30T23:44:34  <Sylph> ah yeah
2010-09-30T23:44:35  <Sylph> of course
2010-09-30T23:44:37  <Sylph> that laziness
2010-09-30T23:44:47  <Sylph> but i never thought that of laziness xd
2010-09-30T23:45:07  <jmcarthur> it's laziness :) the only major difference is that you can't define your own functions like that
2010-09-30T23:45:10  <jmcarthur> in C, that is
2010-09-30T23:45:10  <Sylph> I consider laziness stuff like not calculating until its needed, like if you ask for info like distance
2010-09-30T23:45:16  <jmcarthur> exactly
2010-09-30T23:45:18  <Sylph> or something
2010-09-30T23:45:44  <jmcarthur> false && whatever  // no need to evaluate "whatever"
2010-09-30T23:45:48  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-30T23:45:55  <Sylph> kinda different viewpoint, but it still saves processing
2010-09-30T23:46:06  <jmcarthur> it's more than that
2010-09-30T23:46:10  <Sylph> I was thinking something like that is just a given, rather than being lazy :|
2010-09-30T23:46:11  <jmcarthur> it's an actual control structure
2010-09-30T23:46:17  * Sylph nods
2010-09-30T23:46:18  <jmcarthur> consider the case that whatever is nontermination
2010-09-30T23:46:39  <jmcarthur> changes everything if it's evaluated
2010-09-30T23:46:43  * Sylph nods
2010-09-30T23:46:57  <jmcarthur> even if it performs no side effects (assuming you don't consider nontermination to be a side effect, which i kind of do)
2010-09-30T23:47:06  <Sylph> ah i only knew 'delayed evaluation'
2010-09-30T23:47:13  <Sylph> type of laziness, didn't think the others are lazy too
2010-09-30T23:47:15  <Sylph> interesting
2010-09-30T23:47:27  <Sylph> short circuit is a term i know, but not that its considered lazy evaluation
2010-09-30T23:47:33  <jmcarthur> to be more precise though, C doesn't have delayed evaluation. it's more like delayed execution
2010-09-30T23:47:43  <jmcarthur> where the difference is that execution can perform side effects
2010-09-30T23:47:44  * Sylph nods
2010-09-30T23:48:17  <jmcarthur> lazy execution would be more confusing in practice than lazy evaluation if applied on the kind of scale that haskell applies non-strict evaluation
2010-09-30T23:48:26  * Sylph nods
2010-09-30T23:48:30  <jmcarthur> i keep messing up my wording
2010-09-30T23:48:38  <jmcarthur> non-strictness is not an evaluation order, sorry
2010-09-30T23:49:32  <dmj111> Dumb question.... The version of my bot on the tcp server is not in development... I just have it up there for people to play against.  Is that good or bad for everyone else?  If I figure out how to improve it, I will test the new one there.
2010-09-30T23:49:47  <jmcarthur> dmj111: i don't see how it wuld hurt to be up there

2010-09-30T23:50:29  <dmj111> ok... didn't want to be annoying.
2010-09-30T23:50:51  <sigh> dmj111: most often people complain about *not* having enough active players
2010-09-30T23:51:22  <sigh> so you are helping :)
2010-09-30T23:51:27  <Sylph> phew, two more functions left xd
2010-09-30T23:51:32  <Sylph> It's good for me, dmj
2010-09-30T23:51:39  <sigh> Sylph: is one of them DoTurn?
2010-09-30T23:51:43  <Sylph> I want to test my bot against yours some day
2010-09-30T23:51:45  <dmj111> ok, that was my goal.  That, and I can check my DSL connection from work.
2010-09-30T23:51:45  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T23:51:48  <Sylph> okay, that's three functions
2010-09-30T23:51:50  <Sylph> :|
2010-09-30T23:51:52  <sigh> :P
2010-09-30T23:51:54  <Sylph> I'm talking on the framework
2010-09-30T23:52:01  <sigh> ah, fair enough
2010-09-30T23:52:18  <Sylph> that should giveme all that i wantedwhen i started coding this framework thingy
2010-09-30T23:52:33  <Sylph> and  my bot can finally determine how many to send to planets
2010-09-30T23:52:41  <sigh> just get something up and running, you'll get a better idea of what you want out of your framework after working on your bot a bit
2010-09-30T23:52:46  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-30T23:52:52  <Sylph> I might alter again later
2010-09-30T23:53:01  <Sylph> this final 2 functions will let me make the bot actually work
2010-09-30T23:53:10  <sigh> that's always useful :)
2010-09-30T23:53:21  <Sylph> as it is, the bot only know which planet is best based on its location
2010-09-30T23:53:36  <Sylph> need to know how many units to send :p
2010-09-30T23:53:40  <sigh> :)
2010-09-30T23:54:02  <sigh> that's like the opposite of the starter pack bots
2010-09-30T23:54:34  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-30T23:54:40  <Sylph> true
2010-09-30T23:54:45  <dmj111> See you all later.  I am going to try to stay away for a day or two.
2010-09-30T23:54:51  <sigh> bye
2010-09-30T23:54:56  <Sylph> My bot might be overly complex .><
2010-09-30T23:55:00  <Sylph> God knows i might have miscalculated somewhere
2010-09-30T23:55:08  <Sylph> the distance score calculation is good based on log though
2010-09-30T23:55:11  <Sylph> Cya dmj
2010-09-30T23:55:13  <Sylph> nice to talk to you
