2011-07-14T06:15:21  <rabidus> hey, has anyone seen a draw game?
2011-07-14T06:15:25  <sir_macelon> the page is not updated
2011-07-14T06:15:31  <rabidus> ok
2011-07-14T06:16:08  <rabidus> i mean top rank level draw game
2011-07-14T06:16:17  <sir_macelon> mcleopold has seen one draw, he pasted it here, but it was quite some time ago
2011-07-14T06:16:57  <rabidus> that simply tells that the game is very complicated after all, there will be "allways" a winner
2011-07-14T06:17:03  <rabidus> *always
2011-07-14T06:17:12  <sir_macelon> it's hard to get a draw in this game, maybe if there would be some minimaps around 20x20, like the test map
2011-07-14T06:17:27  <rabidus> yep
2011-07-14T06:17:44  <rabidus> kinda... intresting thing

2011-07-14T06:40:58  <smiley1983> lone ant "wins" against 200 enemies
2011-07-14T06:41:05  <mcstar> smiley1983: i have those kind of "wins" all the times
2011-07-14T06:41:21  <mcstar> its absolutely rubbish
2011-07-14T06:41:31  <mcstar> i more turn, and we'd be eliminated
2011-07-14T06:41:40  <mleise> hahaaa
2011-07-14T06:41:49  <smiley1983> I think the current system requires some work. :)
2011-07-14T06:41:59  <mcstar> agreed
2011-07-14T06:42:32  <mleise> no this looks good to me, the ant that looses all ants except for 1 wins against the one that manages to crawl back out of the hole and take over the board
2011-07-14T06:43:28  <mcstar> mleise: if you wait a couple of turn, the lone ant would die with massive probability
2011-07-14T06:43:40  <mcstar> its not right at all
2011-07-14T06:43:54  <mleise> If th game went on for 10 more rounds and solifugid was eliminated and the turn limit was 1000 the food bonus would have kicked in
2011-07-14T06:44:41  <mleise> mcstar: Yes I was being sarcastic, because green really did the better job here in the end
2011-07-14T06:45:01  <mcstar> i didnt get that, sorry

2011-07-14T06:46:19  <mcstar> sorry, i dont watch star trek
2011-07-14T06:46:26  <smiley1983> I think it wouldn't happen so much with stronger bots - but most bots are weak like mine, and fail to do basic necessary things (like securing territory, or at least trying to revisit it)
2011-07-14T06:46:45  <smiley1983> so strange outcomes emerge
2011-07-14T06:47:08  <mleise> emerge ... hmm I should emerge the latest ebuilds on my gentoo
2011-07-14T06:47:28  <smiley1983> :)
2011-07-14T06:47:45  <mleise> So what can we do to solve this?
2011-07-14T06:47:57  <mleise> Others cry for 2 points per ant killed.
2011-07-14T06:48:09  <mcstar> mleise: thats already done
2011-07-14T06:48:17  <mleise> oh
2011-07-14T06:48:19  <smiley1983> add an extra check for ant numbers, and don't end the game if the winner is massively behind
2011-07-14T06:48:50  <mcstar> mleise: cry for something i think means, you want it badly
2011-07-14T06:48:58  <mcstar> want it badly means you want it very much
2011-07-14T06:49:04  <mcstar> is that what you meant?
2011-07-14T06:49:24  <mleise> yes, because someone - maybe you - wrote a good battle algorithm and wanted the scoring changed badly
2011-07-14T06:49:44  <mleise> because harvesting food was so much easier than writing a good battle algorithm
2011-07-14T06:49:50  <mcstar> ok, front page says that 2 points are given for a killed ant

2011-07-14T06:52:58  <mleise> well in boxing you have victories by points as well.
2011-07-14T06:53:27  <mleise> we can decide if we want this in ants or let the game run until it becomes a ko win
2011-07-14T06:54:09  <smiley1983> I think games should be ended early in some cases, but currently the conditions are not quite right
2011-07-14T06:54:16  <mleise> (hmm, new xorg-server-1.10... should i emerge that?)
2011-07-14T06:54:35  <mcstar> i heard bad things about gentoo system updates
2011-07-14T06:55:03  <mleise> mcstar: like what? smiley1983: talk about this to McLeopold maybe
2011-07-14T06:55:41  <mcstar> collegue of mine had trouble after upgrades, wellm with upgrades, sometimes packages wont compile
2011-07-14T06:58:27  <mleise> mcstar: Oh I got used to this. It's not gentoo's fault in general. Often some packages just wont compile against certain versions of other packages. I usually mask the offending packages though an entry in /etc/portage/package.mask then and wait for the next version. :p
2011-07-14T06:59:22  <mcstar> i cant stand those kind of annoyances
2011-07-14T06:59:59  <mcstar> i understand that linux is not win/osx, but i wont choose a troublesome solution over a "just works" solution
2011-07-14T07:00:29  <mleise> Gentoo is a 'rolling' distribution, so the updates come in as they are released. On Ubuntu for example they are more thoroughly checked and at some point an upgrade is done.
2011-07-14T07:00:43  <mcstar> arch is rolling too, but its binary
2011-07-14T07:00:49  <mcstar> never had a package rpoblem
2011-07-14T07:01:45  <mcstar> im not trying to convince you, its just my personal preference
2011-07-14T07:02:19  <mcstar> if i want to compile something i can do with cp -r /var/abs/extra/something .; cd something; makepkg -s
2011-07-14T07:02:44  <mcstar> and sudo pacman -U something.ver.tar.xz
2011-07-14T07:03:40  <mleise> mcstar: If I was just switching from Windows to Linux now, I would probably chose Arch. But now I'm used to Gentoo
2011-07-14T07:03:57  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-14T07:04:02  <mcstar> kind of you
2011-07-14T07:04:25  <mleise> I know the compiles are tideous, but with ccache it works ok
2011-07-14T07:05:37  <mleise> Also with binaries you sometimes lose one degree of freedom: You cannot chose what features to activate. Some packages support bluetooth, but you don't need that support.
2011-07-14T07:06:20  <mleise> If it is a plugin it can be installed as a separate binary package, but this is not always the case.
2011-07-14T07:07:46  <mleise> On the other hand I have to constantly be up to date on what is state of the art. hal has been replaced by udev now. xorg.conf is optional.
2011-07-14T07:08:17  <mcstar> well, a year ago?
2011-07-14T07:08:21  <mcstar> maybe more?
2011-07-14T07:08:22  <mleise> many big changes are announced in the news when updating the package tree though
2011-07-14T07:08:59  <mleise> mcstar: yes that were just examples. i don't know what I'm currently lagging behind with. I guess btrfs replacing ext4 or so
2011-07-14T07:09:35  <mcstar> i only heard abuot btrfs from your conversation with bhask.er
2011-07-14T07:09:48  <mleise> me too :p
2011-07-14T07:10:00  <mcstar> im wont be upgrading filesystems just becasue
2011-07-14T07:10:11  <mcstar> im quite happy with xfs/ext4
2011-07-14T07:10:22  <mleise> Well, if it finally gets me online backup and defrag I will use it
2011-07-14T07:10:41  <mcstar> defrag?
2011-07-14T07:10:44  <mcstar> why?
2011-07-14T07:10:46  <mleise> I would do backups more regularly
2011-07-14T07:11:08  <mleise> defrag, because files fragment over time and I like watching little squares move around?
2011-07-14T07:11:21  <mcstar> really?
2011-07-14T07:11:58  <mcstar> i read some time ago that performance doesnt really degrade with fragmentation on modern linux filesystems
2011-07-14T07:12:08  <mleise> I tried it with ext4 on an older IBM T23 notebook and the defrag made it boot WAY faster
2011-07-14T07:12:18  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-14T07:12:37  <mleise> I just copied the files to an external drive and reformatted
2011-07-14T07:13:19  <mcstar> but those drives have huge seek times
2011-07-14T07:13:25  <mcstar> anyway, i dont really care
2011-07-14T07:13:30  <mleise> So the disk may have been slow, not 50% empty or i compiled to many gentoo packages there, but the point is that file fragmentation happens
2011-07-14T07:13:38  <mcstar> i mean, its good the way it is now for me
2011-07-14T07:13:54  <mcstar> i believe you
2011-07-14T07:14:26  <mcstar> but i need to draw those diagrams now :S
2011-07-14T07:14:35  <mleise> now I have ureadahead (stolen from ubuntu) and I don't think it will become much faster now :)
2011-07-14T07:15:27  <mleise> you need to draw some manually or programatically?
2011-07-14T07:15:41  <mcstar> point and click and type
2011-07-14T07:15:55  <mleise> try some uml tools
2011-07-14T07:16:05  <mcstar> aaaa, i dont know
2011-07-14T07:16:08  <mleise> or use InkScape
2011-07-14T07:16:15  <mcstar> i dont want to waste my time learning uml
2011-07-14T07:16:19  <mcstar> maybe graphviz
2011-07-14T07:16:42  <mcstar> but its a one time thing, ao i just draw lines and such
2011-07-14T07:16:55  <mcstar> i try Dia, its a gtk diagram editor
2011-07-14T07:17:10  <mleise> InkScape is a SVG editor, so what you learn there is useful for other things, like creating icons, web graphics, drawing some ant game situations :p
2011-07-14T07:17:19  <mcstar> i sed inkscape
2011-07-14T07:17:31  <mcstar> for dissecting pdf papers
2011-07-14T07:17:56  <mcstar> but i definitely wont need vector graphics in the near/far future

2011-07-14T09:01:05  <fbparis> ants in desesperate situation should suicide rather than giving 2 points to the opponent
2011-07-14T09:02:08  <mleise> so it would be good to always walk in packs of 2
2011-07-14T09:02:28  <fbparis> yes, i thought about this too

2011-07-14T09:02:47  <fbparis> but it would slow the expansion, so depends on the time
2011-07-14T09:03:14  <fbparis> at least when an ant is near water..
2011-07-14T09:03:18  <fbparis> plouf
2011-07-14T09:05:31  <fbparis> traps may be fun too, ants staying around a piece of food, and acting like a black hole for stupid bots :D
2011-07-14T09:06:11  <mleise> lol
2011-07-14T09:07:58  <mleise> we should really asess the intelligence of the other bots in several cetegories like "does it always follow me once it has seen me" "will it prefer food or enemy ants" "does it attack blindly or tactically" "will it stay away from me if I outnumber it" etc.

2011-07-14T09:08:54  <fbparis> logs of old games are available online ?
2011-07-14T09:09:20  <mleise> fbparis: yes, you can watch and download them from id 0 on
2011-07-14T09:09:45  <fbparis> and bots are allowed to access it during a game ?
2011-07-14T09:09:54  <mleise> fbparis: no -.-
2011-07-14T09:10:26  <mleise> anyway you have 0.5 to 1 second per turn so it is hard to make use of that information
2011-07-14T09:10:29  <fbparis> not important, you can compute on all the available log before the game
2011-07-14T09:10:45  <mleise> you talk in riddles
2011-07-14T09:11:57  <fbparis> arf that's stupid
2011-07-14T09:12:19  <fbparis> anyway during a game your bot doesnt know the opponents
2011-07-14T09:13:31  <fbparis> it could try to identify opponent during the game according to its way of playing
2011-07-14T09:13:58  <fbparis> better coding simplier things :D
2011-07-14T09:14:38  <mleise> fbparis: Well, in Planet Wars we had the rule that you must NOT "identify opponent during the game"
2011-07-14T09:15:17  <fbparis> well, that's a stupid rule if you are allowed to get logs
2011-07-14T09:15:28  <fbparis> and how to proove it ?
2011-07-14T09:15:59  <mleise> you can't and it is a bit vague as it still allows to identify individual strategies
2011-07-14T09:16:27  <fbparis> bot taking a decision if some pattern match dosent mean it has identified an opponent :)
2011-07-14T09:16:41  <mleise> right

2011-07-14T09:40:55  <bhasker> is the rankings page still barfed?

2011-07-14T09:44:02  <mleise> This project doesn't seem to have a deadline
2011-07-14T09:44:08  <eashoka> sir_macelon : is it the time out setting you spoke about once which is holding the ranking page now ?

2011-07-14T09:45:39  <bhasker> mostly the framework seems to be ready
2011-07-14T09:45:50  <bhasker> in other news my bot is now hitting 70 rating
2011-07-14T09:46:08  <bhasker> now to make it a bit smarter about picking its battles
2011-07-14T09:46:15  <bhasker> stupid thing goes and fights anything and everythign
2011-07-14T09:46:22  <bhasker> and ends up burning a lot of ants
2011-07-14T09:46:37  <bhasker> while another opponent grows big and eventually crushes it
2011-07-14T09:46:41  <rabidus> how's that tcp coming?
2011-07-14T09:47:13  <eashoka> About the ranking page issue (if it is a performance related one) : Iif it takes too long to load, why not split it into several smaller pages (say about 20 entries each) and then display a list of links (at the bottom or top or both) to directly load each page. that way ppl can get to pages with minimal number of clicks, at the same time watch individual pages should load fast.c
2011-07-14T09:48:16  <eashoka> bhasker : congrats!
2011-07-14T09:48:34  <bhasker> thanks
2011-07-14T09:49:11  <bhasker> at least i am happy it doesn't do stupid things like suicide in the first 20 turns
2011-07-14T09:51:06  <sir_macelon> eashoka: I don't know what happed to rankings page, but it is frozen now and someone from the contest organizers should take a look at it

2011-07-14T14:33:50  <mathis_> hey guys. I downloaded Toolz.zip and all the python sample bots are working but i can't figure out how to use the java bots. i tried "java sample_bots\java\LeftyBot.class" and other stuff, can anyone help me?
2011-07-14T14:40:59  <berak> tools.zip seems to contain only the source code of the java bots, you have to compile them first(on your own), before using LeftyBot, etc
2011-07-14T14:42:51  <mathis_> i have compiled them, i can see the .class files
2011-07-14T14:44:31  <berak> try "java sample_bots\java\Leftybot" <-- whithout .class, then
2011-07-14T14:44:35  <mathis_> the name of the Bot is correct, in the replay it says "4. LeftyBot.class (crashed)"
2011-07-14T14:45:48  <mathis_> without the ".class" it doesn't even get the right name in the replay, it just says "4. player 4 (crashed)"
2011-07-14T14:46:25  <janzert> mathis_: try running the command directly yourself and make sure the bot is executed correctly
2011-07-14T14:46:57  <BtbN> java -classpath sample_bots\java Leftybot

2011-07-14T14:51:22  <mathis_> okay thanks, "java -cp sample_bots\java LeftyBot" seems to work
2011-07-14T14:52:34  <mathis_> it's a bit strange that now it says "3. java" even though it's the fourth player and the name of the bot of course isn't java

2011-07-14T19:28:03  <jmcarthur> bhasker: based on what you have said earlier about the state of the contest, its sounds like you believe the battle resolution method is a problem right now. what do you think is wrong with it? (i personally think the worst thing about the game right now is lack of depth, and second place is the scoring system)

2011-07-14T19:32:27  <bhasker> battle reolution is too dimple
2011-07-14T19:32:32  <bhasker> *simple
2011-07-14T19:33:12  <bhasker> very little strategy in area control
2011-07-14T19:33:33  <bhasker> still seems to be who spread faster
2011-07-14T19:33:40  <bhasker> wins
2011-07-14T19:34:06  <bhasker> in 10 way battles it can be because of luck
2011-07-14T19:34:08  <jmcarthur> just to be clear, you are talking about the "focus" battle resolution?
2011-07-14T19:34:24  <bhasker> in general all methids are too simple
2011-07-14T19:34:50  <bhasker> but mostly i think there isnt much strategy to the games
2011-07-14T19:35:06  <jmcarthur> personally i think we need to make the games more goal oriented and less score oriented
2011-07-14T19:35:25  <bhasker> i guess so
2011-07-14T19:35:42  <bhasker> mostly i think 2 player games are interesting
2011-07-14T19:35:51  <jmcarthur> score could still play a part in it, but it should be deeper than just moving next to food or moving next to an opponent
2011-07-14T19:35:57  <bhasker> above 4 it becomes too chaotic
2011-07-14T19:36:22  <bhasker> 2-4 would be a good balance
2011-07-14T19:37:00  <bhasker> i think making it so that bots that control  more territory get more food or score would be fun
2011-07-14T19:37:32  <bhasker> there should be an incentive to hold something
2011-07-14T19:37:55  <jmcarthur> i want to see king of the hill or something
2011-07-14T19:38:01  <jmcarthur> maybe with a moving hill
2011-07-14T19:38:24  <jmcarthur> hold the hill for n turns, you get a point, it moves to somewhere else
2011-07-14T19:39:08  <jmcarthur> i dunno
2011-07-14T19:39:18  <jmcarthur> i think this game is just about the worst combination of features we could have thought up
2011-07-14T19:39:47  <jmcarthur> not that that's stopping me from participating, so i guess that's still saying something
2011-07-14T19:39:59  <jmcarthur> but it could just be that i'm holding out hope that we will actually improve it
2011-07-14T19:48:02  <bhasker> yea
2011-07-14T19:48:09  <bhasker> this game is not half as interesting as planetwars
2011-07-14T19:48:25  <jmcarthur> which IMO was not half as interesting as tron
2011-07-14T19:48:45  <jmcarthur> despite tron being much simpler
2011-07-14T19:49:16  <bhasker> not sure about tron since i didn' take part in that one
