2012-08-14T10:30:20  <antimatroid> mcstar:  nice
2012-08-14T10:30:34  <antimatroid> using a cas doesn't really help them understand
2012-08-14T10:30:46  <mcstar> no, it helps you not mess up something
2012-08-14T10:30:48  <antimatroid> the whole point is to work through by hand to see how it works
2012-08-14T10:30:49  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-14T10:31:13  <mcstar> and you can save it, and looks more readable than on paper
2012-08-14T10:31:22  <mcstar> at least these are the reasons i use it
2012-08-14T10:31:23  <antimatroid> i just do it on the whiteboard
2012-08-14T10:31:34  <mcstar> oh, and theres more simplifications built in than i know...
2012-08-14T10:32:23  <mcstar> antimatroid: incidentally, he had good chances to be accepted for another job, an IT firm
2012-08-14T10:32:33  <mcstar> they were looking for mathematicians too
2012-08-14T10:32:39  <antimatroid> when it rains it pours
2012-08-14T10:32:44  <mcstar> he told me quite amusing stories..
2012-08-14T10:33:12  <mcstar> the guy, who lead him around in this other firm, said something like this: we are dealing with a special kind of mathematics
2012-08-14T10:33:20  <mcstar> we use so called, rotation matrices!
2012-08-14T10:33:24  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-14T10:33:28  <mcstar> you dont say
2012-08-14T10:33:58  <mcstar> and the guy was also surprised that my friend knew about quaternions
2012-08-14T10:34:11  <antimatroid> lol
2012-08-14T10:34:23  <mcstar> you would have loved working there
2012-08-14T10:34:39  <mcstar> the ceo was a hard core c++-er
2012-08-14T10:34:46  <mcstar> and he was proud of it
2012-08-14T10:34:50  <antimatroid> dunno, that guy sounds pretty facepalm worthy
2012-08-14T10:34:58  <mcstar> like in, he is sexy and he knows it'
2012-08-14T10:35:13  <mcstar> no, i meant because of the c++
2012-08-14T10:35:16  <antimatroid> like the biologists who finally discovered numerical integration aha
2012-08-14T10:35:25  <mcstar> who was that?
2012-08-14T10:35:31  <antimatroid> do you know what i refer to?
2012-08-14T10:35:34  <mcstar> no

2012-08-14T10:38:09  <mcstar> yeah, i think calculus wasnt invented back then
2012-08-14T10:38:10  <antimatroid> it's actually a pretty neat idea

2012-08-14T10:40:22  <antimatroid> phylogenetics has exploded
2012-08-14T10:40:46  <mcstar> the really interesting biology stuff is done by multi disciplinary physicists  i think
2012-08-14T10:41:00  <antimatroid> yeah, one of my phd advisors is such a person
2012-08-14T10:41:21  <mcstar> dynamical systems play also a huge role in modern biology

2012-08-14T10:42:57  <mcstar> whoa
2012-08-14T10:43:20  <antimatroid> straight from the wikipedia page on him "Peter D.

He has also applied classical invariant theory to problems of quantum physics (entanglement measures for mixed state systems), and also to phylogenetic reconstruction (entanglement measures, including distan
2012-08-14T10:43:25  * mcstar doesnt know what phylogenetics is
2012-08-14T10:43:58  <mcstar> so thats your secondary advisor?
2012-08-14T10:44:09  <antimatroid> neither do i barely, my layman understanding is studying genetic family trees for evolution
2012-08-14T10:44:13  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-08-14T10:44:36  <antimatroid> "In biology, phylogenetics ( /faɪlɵdʒɪˈnɛtɪks/) is the study of evolutionary relation among groups of organisms (e.g. species, populations), which is discovered through molecular sequencing data and morphological data matrices"
