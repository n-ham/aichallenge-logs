2010-12-11T00:00:00  <Frontier_> ok, they are lawyers. they cannot know open source isn't a language *rofl*
2010-12-11T00:01:00  <sigh> hard to say if it is the lawyers, or just a very ignorant journalist

2010-12-11T00:04:47  <Frontier_> hmm, seems to be the journalist. COMPUTER LANGUAGE is also a bit vague. How about programming language or computer jargon? At least we learnt that the licensing issues are murky.
2010-12-11T00:05:28  <Frontier_> but only if the correct language was used!: Open Source. What's the lates compiler version anyway?
2010-12-11T00:05:39  <Frontier_> GPL2?
2010-12-11T00:05:59  <sigh> more importantly, how does it compare against Lisp for AI?

2010-12-11T00:07:54  <Frontier_> Do I see that right? He had two editors reviewing the text and his name is McCool?
2010-12-11T00:09:25  <antimatroid1> that's one of my biggest problems with the legal system of today
2010-12-11T00:09:36  <antimatroid1> most of the time the lawyers and judges have nfi what they're talking about
2010-12-11T00:09:44  <antimatroid1> couldn't we have like a technical court?
2010-12-11T00:09:52  <sigh> yeah, I agree
2010-12-11T00:10:47  <antimatroid1> i don't even pay attention to the law, i just try not to impose negatively on other peoples lives
2010-12-11T00:11:17  <Frontier_> that can easily cost you a fee now and then
2010-12-11T00:11:29  <antimatroid1> more than happy to pay it :)
2010-12-11T00:12:08  <antimatroid1> i got a $120 fine for an open container of alcohol in public once, at the time speeding fines were $80 if you were just over the limit
2010-12-11T00:12:45  <antimatroid1> that was absurd! if one crime is comparably worse by any measure, the punishment should be worse, and no one can argue speeding is less dangerous to other people than an open container of alcohol in public
2010-12-11T00:12:46  <Frontier_> Something is strange about you.
2010-12-11T00:13:05  <antimatroid1> i'm very very stubborn
2010-12-11T00:13:13  <antimatroid1> much more stubborn than your average person :)
2010-12-11T00:13:20  <Frontier_> No, you are happy to pay fines.
2010-12-11T00:13:54  <sigh> you could even say that he is fine with it
2010-12-11T00:15:04  <Frontier_> When it is 1:58 and someone says: "I have two to two on my clock, what's on your's?" I can answer "Two to two, too."
2010-12-11T00:16:10  <sigh> o_O
2010-12-11T00:16:14  <antimatroid1> i am not happy to pay them, but i value not following stupid rules more than the cost of paying them when i get hit
2010-12-11T00:16:29  <Frontier_> I was recently supposed to pay 40€ for forgetting to pinch my train ticked. A ticket that is valid for two hours, and that I bought just before entering the train as could be checked with a look on the ticket.
2010-12-11T00:17:15  <Frontier_> A ticket that cost 3.60.
2010-12-11T00:17:33  <antimatroid1> tell them they're dreaming
2010-12-11T00:17:55  <Frontier_> I did. They wanted to check my id.
2010-12-11T00:18:34  <burny> is it like.. you can buy it any time.. and it's not valid until 'pinched', aka. marked as used?
2010-12-11T00:19:32  <Frontier_> Yes burny, but it is not legit to accuse someone of a crime he could be about to commit on a later ride with the same ticket. common!
2010-12-11T00:20:00  <Frontier_> If I had no ticket and hid on the toilet I would have payed 3.60 less.
2010-12-11T00:20:39  <antimatroid1> i was using trams in melbourne one summer without buying tickets (poor teenage skateboarder, what can I say) and the inspector got on and said right i'm checking tickets
2010-12-11T00:20:50  <antimatroid1> we got up, asked the driver to open the doors and got off, can't believe that worked aha
2010-12-11T00:21:00  <burny> I'm sure a number of tarts, just carry a ticket with them until they get cought, then make up a story, and get a new ticket
2010-12-11T00:21:26  <Frontier_> burny: But then their ticked dates back a few days.
2010-12-11T00:21:32  <burny> thus the id.. to make sure the same person doesn't do it more than once a year or some such
2010-12-11T00:21:46  <burny> ah, ya true..
2010-12-11T00:21:55  <burny> that is more benefit of the doubty
2010-12-11T00:22:04  <Frontier_> The id was for that and to send me a letter with the fine.
2010-12-11T00:22:19  <antimatroid1> are you allowed to buy a ticket and use it later?
2010-12-11T00:22:28  <antimatroid1> liek a parent buying their kids tickets for school days
2010-12-11T00:23:02  <Frontier_> Yes you are. Some tickets must be pinched other not. It has to do with the distance you travel.
2010-12-11T00:23:35  <antimatroid1> we don't have passenger trains in tasmania
2010-12-11T00:23:56  <antimatroid1> and i stopped getting busses when i got my license, although i've mostly been riding a bike the last few months
2010-12-11T00:25:27  <Frontier_> To finish the story, I wrote the railroad company a fax telling them how unjust their regulation is and they reduced the fine to 10€. :D
2010-12-11T00:26:06  <antimatroid1> they should have just waived it, but better than original
2010-12-11T00:26:53  <Frontier_> The 30€ I saved were only lost a few weeks later when some strange guy told me he is my neighbour and he quickly needs 30€ because the police got his car and he doesn't have the money at hand to buy it back, and he doesn't want his wife to notice...
2010-12-11T00:29:13  <antimatroid1> lol
2010-12-11T00:29:18  <antimatroid1> i've never had that happen to me
2010-12-11T00:29:20  <Frontier_> Later I thought a lot of why humans are so helpful and what that has to do with our success in creating civilizations. I guess in all the thousands of years quite a few people lost '30€' on the way.
2010-12-11T00:29:41  <antimatroid1> someone broke into my house when i was here last year in december
2010-12-11T00:29:57  <antimatroid1> i called the cops as they were breaking in, they showed up like an hour later, but i chased them off with a (field) hockey stick in hand
2010-12-11T00:30:06  <antimatroid1> stupid bogans aren't getting my possessions, not while i'm here
2010-12-11T00:30:42  <antimatroid1> (there is very little risk of someone having a gun here in australia)

The funny thing is, he broke into the toilet window, but for some strange reason this time my mother shut off the doors inside the house as well and he didn't manage to open that toilet door.
2010-12-11T00:37:09  <Frontier_> Roumors have it there was police in the area that night for some other reason, so he thought someone saw him.

2010-12-11T03:23:50  <antimatroid1> sigh: down for a conversation on movement with ant game?
2010-12-11T03:24:31  <sigh> what's the latest topic of discussion?
2010-12-11T03:24:41  <antimatroid1> there are 3 cases I consider problematic, i'm considering both options of friends being allowed in the same square or not
2010-12-11T03:25:27  <sigh> it's simpler if they are, I think, because you don't need collision detection then
2010-12-11T03:25:30  <sigh> what are the cons?
2010-12-11T03:25:34  <antimatroid1> case 1: enemy bots have an empty square between them and both move into it
2010-12-11T03:25:35  <antimatroid1> case 2: enemy bots are adjacent and try to move into each others square
2010-12-11T03:25:35  <antimatroid1> case 3: 2 friend bots and 2 enemy bots surround and empty square, all 4 bots try to move into it
2010-12-11T03:26:13  <antimatroid1> and more cases come up, but i think resolving those will cover most issues
2010-12-11T03:26:37  <antimatroid1> it's also easier to allow friend bots to be on the same square for creating new bots
2010-12-11T03:26:46  <antimatroid1> otherwise it's complicated to work out where new bots appear
2010-12-11T03:27:14  <sigh> why not just isolate fights to a block?
2010-12-11T03:27:28  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2010-12-11T03:27:31  <antimatroid1> and what about case 2?

2010-12-11T03:27:44  <antimatroid1> do they "fight" moving through each other, or just pass each other
2010-12-11T03:27:45  <sigh> let them move
2010-12-11T03:27:52  <sigh> just pass
2010-12-11T03:27:57  <antimatroid1> i think fight as they pass
2010-12-11T03:28:03  <antimatroid1> if one dies, then they're gone
2010-12-11T03:28:03  <sigh> sure, that's possible too
2010-12-11T03:28:27  <sigh> have you determined hwo fights are resolvged?
2010-12-11T03:28:35  <sigh> *how fights are resolved?
2010-12-11T03:28:38  <antimatroid1> another issue is how to give the game state to them, if it's a grid of characters, how do you indicate a bot of player 1 with x hp
2010-12-11T03:29:07  <antimatroid1> i think points should be taken from the enemy ant with the most hp first
2010-12-11T03:29:13  <antimatroid1> then i think it works fine
2010-12-11T03:29:24  <sigh> least hp first
2010-12-11T03:29:41  <antimatroid1> wouldn't the most dominant ant take on the battle?
2010-12-11T03:29:46  <antimatroid1> and protect the weak
2010-12-11T03:30:05  <sigh> if you could micro then you would attack the weakest first
2010-12-11T03:30:19  <sigh> but yes, if you were defending you would protect the weak
2010-12-11T03:30:26  <antimatroid1> yeah okay, i'm making a forum post, i'll leave that question open to people
2010-12-11T03:30:28  <sigh> so really depends from who's side you look
2010-12-11T03:30:38  <antimatroid1> any idea on representing the board?
2010-12-11T03:31:08  <sigh> map item => coord
2010-12-11T03:31:11  <antimatroid1> with field of vision, do you think you should see the radius of current ant positions, or that and any previously viewable square? with the second option the current radius can be much smaller
2010-12-11T03:32:14  <sigh> I think you should be able to see map features that you have seen before, but not enemies outside fov

2010-12-11T03:32:35  <antimatroid1> so just a really big list for input and users fill up a blank board? with an example line
2010-12-11T03:32:36  <antimatroid1> A 1 4 0 0 (ant, player 1, 4 hp, x, y)?
2010-12-11T03:33:05  <sigh> yeah, that's reasonable
2010-12-11T03:33:13  <antimatroid1> wait, you want to see resources you could previously, but not an enemy, but you get info from them taking resources?
2010-12-11T03:33:30  <sigh> hmmm
2010-12-11T03:33:59  <antimatroid1> i quite like having full past visibility and a radius of view of like 1
2010-12-11T03:33:59  <sigh> meh, I guess just fov then and force people to remember what they need
2010-12-11T03:34:05  <antimatroid1> so you have to scout out the map
2010-12-11T03:34:25  <sigh> full past visibility isn't as "realistic"
2010-12-11T03:34:35  <sigh> where does the visibility come from?
2010-12-11T03:34:36  <antimatroid1> tis true
2010-12-11T03:34:49  <antimatroid1> where does our telepathic communication come from?
2010-12-11T03:34:53  <antimatroid1> maybe they leave cameras :P
2010-12-11T03:35:13  <sigh> sure, but then allow me to destroy enemy camera :)
2010-12-11T03:35:24  <sigh> that's a valid way to go
2010-12-11T03:35:29  <antimatroid1> that's actually kind of a cool idea
2010-12-11T03:35:40  <sigh> call it a marker, say
2010-12-11T03:35:48  <antimatroid1> only one person can have viewing rights of a square at once, except in current view of ants
2010-12-11T03:36:03  <antimatroid1> but possibly complicating things again too much
2010-12-11T03:36:28  <antimatroid1> i think just current field of vision
2010-12-11T03:36:39  <antimatroid1> what is your opinion on walls?
2010-12-11T03:36:47  <antimatroid1> should they be there at the start and should they be makeable?
2010-12-11T03:37:04  <sigh> makeable introduces a whole new level of complexity
2010-12-11T03:37:41  <sigh> I would leave makeable walls alone and only consider them if you have everything else figured out
2010-12-11T03:37:56  <antimatroid1> what about having them at the start?
2010-12-11T03:38:01  <epona> I think the combat needs improvement
2010-12-11T03:38:22  <sigh> sure, you need some map features
2010-12-11T03:38:25  <antimatroid1> epona: that front page is a bad representation of the current form we're talking about
2010-12-11T03:38:34  <antimatroid1> map features already exist with resources
2010-12-11T03:38:35  <sigh> I would want at least some path finding would be required
2010-12-11T03:38:48  <antimatroid1> okay, walls are in
2010-12-11T03:38:52  <sigh> map features that are obstacles
2010-12-11T03:39:09  <antimatroid1> i know i probably am alone in wanting this one.. i want multiple edge wrappings
2010-12-11T03:39:24  <sigh> multiple?
2010-12-11T03:39:26  <antimatroid1> we can do torus, cylindrical and mobius strip quite easily
2010-12-11T03:39:45  <sigh> and klien bottle :P
2010-12-11T03:39:49  <antimatroid1> it complicates things, i just want it for awesomeness

2010-12-11T03:40:08  <antimatroid1> i'm joking (only half) i know it's not reasonable
2010-12-11T03:40:18  <epona> whats edge wrapping?
2010-12-11T03:40:21  <antimatroid1> i think torus wrapping?
2010-12-11T03:40:35  <antimatroid1> epona: you can go out of the edges and arrive on another edge it's "wrapped" to
2010-12-11T03:40:53  <antimatroid1> if you wrap top to bottom (should be bum) and left to right, then you get a torus
2010-12-11T03:40:57  <antimatroid1> kind of
2010-12-11T03:41:07  <epona> oh ok
2010-12-11T03:41:17  <sigh> personally, I don't like edge wrappings
2010-12-11T03:41:32  <sigh> it makes the map smaller, and more uniform
2010-12-11T03:41:38  <antimatroid1> i think it's cool, it gives you a pesudo infinite board
2010-12-11T03:41:53  <antimatroid1> in that you can just keep walking up
2010-12-11T03:41:55  <epona> I think its a great way to make it more dynamic

2010-12-11T03:42:02  <sigh> the earth is infinite!
2010-12-11T03:42:21  <antimatroid1> you can in theory go in one direction and not ever have to stop
2010-12-11T03:42:23  <antimatroid1> that's what i mean
2010-12-11T03:42:48  <antimatroid1> assuming a flat fully spherical earth :P
2010-12-11T03:42:48  <sigh> well, my opinion is that it will make the game less interesting
2010-12-11T03:42:58  <sigh> but it seems everyone disagrees, so meh
2010-12-11T03:43:10  <antimatroid1> it's only a small pool of people in here
2010-12-11T03:43:16  <antimatroid1> how big do you want grids?
2010-12-11T03:43:22  <antimatroid1> i was thinking just have all 32x32?
2010-12-11T03:43:36  <sigh> that seems small if you want wrapping
2010-12-11T03:43:46  <antimatroid1> 64x64?
2010-12-11T03:44:07  <sigh> i don't know, size will have to be tweaked once you have impl
2010-12-11T03:44:31  <sigh> depends on game length too, turn duration and various other factors
2010-12-11T03:44:35  <antimatroid1> true, still something that needs working out at some point
2010-12-11T03:44:42  <antimatroid1> i think we need longer than 200 turns for this
2010-12-11T03:45:02  <antimatroid1> i would consider reducing time limits to 0.5 seconds?
2010-12-11T03:45:38  <antimatroid1> if we are getting that to ourselves and only one bot per core at a time, it's what we got now in the worst case
2010-12-11T03:46:20  <sigh> possilbly
2010-12-11T03:46:29  <sigh> anyway, those sort of params are easily configured later
2010-12-11T03:46:30  <antimatroid1> i don't like it, i think more interesting ideas will be used with more time
2010-12-11T03:46:33  <antimatroid1> but i'm thinking practically
2010-12-11T03:47:02  <sigh> if you want more time, then engineer a game with less moves
2010-12-11T03:47:51  <antimatroid1> you can reduce the size of the board to reduce game time
2010-12-11T03:49:02  <sigh> sure
2010-12-11T03:52:13  <epona> I have an idea
2010-12-11T03:52:32  <epona> what if the next challenge was a 2v2
2010-12-11T03:52:41  <epona> and teamwork was beneficial
2010-12-11T03:52:57  <epona> then its even more complicated
2010-12-11T03:53:35  <antimatroid1> ranking bots gets so much harder
2010-12-11T03:53:40  <sigh> makes the game harder to balance and harder to rank...
2010-12-11T03:53:41  <sigh> yeah
2010-12-11T03:53:53  <antimatroid1> it would work for this ants idea i think
2010-12-11T03:53:59  <epona> well two people would be going in it to the end
2010-12-11T03:54:02  <sigh> either way, I think you need a tried and tested game to pull of 2vw
2010-12-11T03:54:05  <antimatroid1> i'd be down for it, but people wont shut up about rankings
2010-12-11T03:54:10  <epona> or mix it up
2010-12-11T03:54:17  <epona> Idt its about rankings
2010-12-11T03:54:28  <epona> this is the "ai challenge"
2010-12-11T03:54:47  <antimatroid1> i think 2 player symmetric games are fine
2010-12-11T03:55:26  <antimatroid1> bah, i've changed my mind
2010-12-11T03:55:35  <epona> why so?
2010-12-11T03:55:37  <antimatroid1> it would be a lot more interesting if bots couldn't communicate what they can see at all
2010-12-11T03:56:03  <Frontier_> ohhhhh
2010-12-11T03:56:15  <epona> so their on their own?
2010-12-11T03:56:27  <antimatroid1> yes, but they can try to coordinate if they can see each other
2010-12-11T03:56:33  <antimatroid1> but without communication
2010-12-11T03:56:49  <antimatroid1> or actually, then add back in the changing colour idea
2010-12-11T03:56:57  <antimatroid1> okay, i'm proposing that, that's much cooler
2010-12-11T03:57:17  <epona> agreed
2010-12-11T03:57:39  <antimatroid1> now how to run lots of ants of each player?
2010-12-11T03:58:42  <antimatroid1> who wanted a better battle resolution idea? i have one
2010-12-11T03:59:44  <epona> hmm
2010-12-11T04:00:10  <antimatroid1> players can shoot bullets, only one of their bullets can exist in their field of view at a time, if it hits a wall it disappears, if it hits a player, it removes 1hp, if it goes out of the field of vision, the bullet dies or keeps going but they can fire again
2010-12-11T04:00:34  <epona> was never a fan of projectiles
2010-12-11T04:00:45  <antimatroid1> but then you can't be in the same square with them, and it makes resolution harder again
2010-12-11T04:01:15  <antimatroid1> i think fights should just be performed inside a square if you land there and maybe if you both pass through each other
2010-12-11T04:02:21  <Frontier_> what if I keep running away like a coward? after all the map is endless :D
2010-12-11T04:02:45  <antimatroid1> surround them :P
2010-12-11T04:02:52  <antimatroid1> and walls will be randomly added to maps at the start
2010-12-11T04:03:08  <antimatroid1> we can adjust the number of walls added
2010-12-11T04:03:48  <Frontier_> Ok, but as long as I don't run into a dead end, I will always be as fast as any other ant. except you can move diagonally
2010-12-11T04:04:42  <antimatroid1> i don't think diagonal moves are being considered
2010-12-11T04:04:53  <Frontier_> I guess I would be running like hell until I find spice and then just sit on it and wait.
2010-12-11T04:04:54  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure about ants being separate process
2010-12-11T04:05:23  <antimatroid1> not only is it messy to set that up, the engine needs to work out information for each individual ant and send it
2010-12-11T04:05:36  <epona> it sounds like a golden idea to me
2010-12-11T04:05:49  <antimatroid1> it does doesn't it
2010-12-11T04:05:57  <antimatroid1> i don't think it should be too hard for people to write their bots either
2010-12-11T04:06:00  <Frontier_> antimatroid: Isn't the fov just a moving bit-map?
2010-12-11T04:06:22  <antimatroid1> depends which metric you use

2010-12-11T04:07:27  <Frontier_> ! implement this "cannot see through walls thing"
2010-12-11T04:07:41  <Frontier_> I already thought out some ambush tactics for that case
2010-12-11T04:07:47  <antimatroid1> it's doable
2010-12-11T04:07:55  <antimatroid1> paint the field of view
2010-12-11T04:08:00  <antimatroid1> rather than just get it
2010-12-11T04:12:27  <Frontier_> If ants could share squares, wouldn't it be hard to visualize and result in stacks running around to deal more damage?
2010-12-11T04:13:31  <antimatroid1> one option is to force ant fusion
2010-12-11T04:13:36  <Frontier_> I'm just thinking if the map is symmetric, then how would I gain an advantage over the enemy in battles.
2010-12-11T04:13:39  <antimatroid1> but then we're back at the problem of where to new ants spring up
2010-12-11T04:14:20  <Frontier_> If ants had a direction they could spawn new ants in front of them
2010-12-11T04:14:40  <Frontier_> or just decide where they should spawn
2010-12-11T04:14:40  <antimatroid1> what if that square isn't free?
2010-12-11T04:15:02  <antimatroid1> the decision rule is messy
2010-12-11T04:15:05  <Frontier_> then they didn't use their server information right
2010-12-11T04:15:29  <antimatroid1> what if an enemy bot moved there when you went to make the kid?
2010-12-11T04:15:55  <Frontier_> you would have one happen after the other

2010-12-11T04:16:20  <antimatroid1> i'd say child creation then child creates enemy that comes in
2010-12-11T04:17:03  <Frontier_> for example move first, then spawn. that way, when you see an enemy two squares ahead you reconsider placing a new ant there
2010-12-11T04:17:40  <Frontier_> and the enemy doesn't run into an ant out of nowhere
2010-12-11T04:18:40  <Frontier_> antimatroid1: I don't understand what you said. child creates enemy?!
2010-12-11T04:18:57  <antimatroid1> child fights enemy** sorry
2010-12-11T04:19:24  <Frontier_> you can do that too, but i think it is frustrating for the attacker
2010-12-11T04:20:27  <antimatroid1> sigh: if we do a wrapped grid, ants don't even need to be given specific coordinates to the main map, only information in their field of view
2010-12-11T04:20:35  <antimatroid1> so they don't even need to know how big the maps are
2010-12-11T04:20:38  <antimatroid1> i like that
2010-12-11T04:21:01  <antimatroid1> i guess you can do that with no wrapped, but they can feel out the map better
2010-12-11T04:21:33  <Frontier_> that's like in RoboCom :-)
2010-12-11T04:21:56  <Frontier_> You are getting closer to it. Now add the interpreted game language
2010-12-11T04:22:28  <sigh> co-ordinates issues are not much different bw wrapped and not wrapped... wrapped almost forces you to give ant-centric info
2010-12-11T04:23:38  <antimatroid1> a friend just had a cool idea, emulate pheramone, lets ants leave a colour on a square that lasts x turns
2010-12-11T04:25:26  <antimatroid1> i think that's complicating too much again
2010-12-11T04:25:31  <antimatroid1> cool idea anyway
2010-12-11T04:25:46  <epona> that might be a bit restricting if they have to communicate that way
2010-12-11T04:26:07  <epona> the more open ended it is, the better, imo
2010-12-11T04:26:12  <antimatroid1> if you do "strings" is that viewable by both bots? what about people watching the games?
2010-12-11T04:26:36  <antimatroid1> both players* not bots
2010-12-11T04:27:05  <sigh> people watching the game?
2010-12-11T04:27:53  <antimatroid1> ie. on the website, you watch your games
2010-12-11T04:28:01  <antimatroid1> do you get to see the communicating strings everyone else uses
2010-12-11T04:28:05  <antimatroid1> giving away their strategies
2010-12-11T04:28:14  <antimatroid1> it's cooler if you have to devise your own code with colours
2010-12-11T04:28:37  <antimatroid1> i'm thinking the same with bots setting their viewable message to a bot in viwing distance

2010-12-11T04:42:04  <antimatroid1> you could even pass hp to friend ants in the same square that way

2010-12-11T05:02:57  <antimatroid1> as that also requires harvesting
2010-12-11T05:03:03  <antimatroid1> my idea for resources is as follows:
2010-12-11T05:04:05  <antimatroid1> they get symmetrically added at the start with varying levels of hp, battle happens before harvest, harvest is automatic and goes to the bot with the least hp, if a bots hp goes above H (even), then you get two bots there with H/2 and hp-H/2 hp
2010-12-11T05:04:17  <epona> maybe, improvement of the bots throughout the game
2010-12-11T05:04:43  <epona> game(s)

2010-12-11T05:06:35  <antimatroid1> actually, here's an idea, you can see what the friends you can see can see, and so on?

2010-12-11T05:26:43  <antimatroid1> if ants are separate process, when one splits into two, how do you give the new process all the information the old one was storing? do we just force teh child to start from no info?

2010-12-11T09:14:30  <Meatkat> YAAAS (Yet another attempt at simplification): http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1205&p=8245#p8245
2010-12-11T09:14:47  <Meatkat> I like it... but then... I would :)
2010-12-11T09:14:59  <Meatkat> Certainly makes things more simple
2010-12-11T09:16:58  <antimatroid1> Meatkat: did you read my one above?
2010-12-11T09:17:11  <antimatroid1> it could be done without separate processes too, but i think that makes the game much more interesting
2010-12-11T09:17:57  <antimatroid1> i'm quite confident what i described could actually have a working prototype made for it
2010-12-11T09:18:36  <Meatkat> I think you're is solid. But it's degrees of complexity above mine.
2010-12-11T09:19:20  <antimatroid1> it depends, i think we could merge them
2010-12-11T09:19:29  <Meatkat> I would personally probably prefer yours, but the average shmo would find it intimidating
2010-12-11T09:19:32  <antimatroid1> i like your hole idea with the queen bee and taking them out by entering the hole
2010-12-11T09:19:43  <antimatroid1> but then i would want to be able to genrate walls for defense
2010-12-11T09:19:52  <Meatkat> You can... with ants
2010-12-11T09:20:05  <Meatkat> Since you can't control ants once they fly into a RAGE, neither can the enemy
2010-12-11T09:20:05  <antimatroid1> no, it's very hard to not allow ants to go on top of each other
2010-12-11T09:20:12  <antimatroid1> and i don't like having to fight any ant you see
2010-12-11T09:21:02  <antimatroid1> with my idea, you just need to write a program to handle one bot, knowing it might see bots that are thinking like it is
2010-12-11T09:21:08  <Meatkat> I think that's the best part of it actually, it get rids of SOOO much complicated BS concerned with moving into combat, decisions in combat, if they more here does that count? who moves when.... stuff like that
2010-12-11T09:21:08  <antimatroid1> the engine does most of the messy stuff
2010-12-11T09:21:29  <antimatroid1> you're removing the complex dynamics that make it an interesting game :P
2010-12-11T09:21:52  <Meatkat> I'm removing complex rules to allow for complex dynamics and an interesting game :P
2010-12-11T09:22:08  <antimatroid1> but you never make any choice with regards to where they are
2010-12-11T09:22:22  <antimatroid1> unless you win a battle i guess
2010-12-11T09:22:24  <Meatkat> where 'who' are?
2010-12-11T09:22:26  <antimatroid1> but then that enemy is dead
2010-12-11T09:22:43  <antimatroid1> assume you are you, the enemy is they/them
2010-12-11T09:22:54  <Meatkat> right
2010-12-11T09:23:13  <antimatroid1> also, what if 4 bots try to move into an empty square at once?
2010-12-11T09:23:28  <Meatkat> Yeah, I think this would look really sweet in a visualiser as well, as you see all the ants turn red / yellow and rush into GLORIOUS COMBAT!
2010-12-11T09:23:42  <antimatroid1> and it's possibly that you try to make a string of moves, where the first n aren't invalid until you check a later move
2010-12-11T09:23:43  <Meatkat> they should feel free to do that
2010-12-11T09:23:57  <antimatroid1> possible*
2010-12-11T09:24:08  <Meatkat> ants can occupy the same square in my version
2010-12-11T09:24:14  <Meatkat> the only invalid move is off the map
2010-12-11T09:24:18  <Meatkat> in which case the ant stops
2010-12-11T09:24:37  <antimatroid1> how do they fight?
2010-12-11T09:24:59  <Meatkat> GLORIOUSLY! :) Using one of the combat systems already proposed
2010-12-11T09:25:12  <Meatkat> which ever is the simplest
2010-12-11T09:25:29  <antimatroid1> hmmmm, imo i don't like it other than the hole idea
2010-12-11T09:25:32  <antimatroid1> which i love
2010-12-11T09:25:37  <antimatroid1> but others may
2010-12-11T09:26:06  <antimatroid1> i could change mine to have harvest be just that, and they have to return it to home hole
2010-12-11T09:26:12  <Meatkat> No worries, glad you like the whole idea
2010-12-11T09:26:14  <Meatkat> :)
2010-12-11T09:26:18  <Meatkat> or was it 'hole' idea?
2010-12-11T09:26:32  <antimatroid1> hole, as in the queen bee :P
2010-12-11T09:26:51  <Meatkat> oh, in that case I challenge you to GLORIOUS COMBAT! AntRage style
2010-12-11T09:27:01  <Accoun> @tcp
2010-12-11T09:27:02  <contestbot> Accoun: tcp = (#1) http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/, or (#2) http://72.44.46.68/, or (#3) 98.247.248.39:995 (zeroviz.us), or (#4) http://tcp.zeroviz.us/, or (#5) http://tcp2.zeroviz.us/ (crazy!)
2010-12-11T09:28:42  <Meatkat> It's good to have competing ideas... makes everyone's better. We'll see what people say
2010-12-11T09:29:06  <Meatkat> Probably end up with a combination of something already mentioned (if they actually use this idea at all)
2010-12-11T09:29:34  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-12-11T09:29:43  <antimatroid1> i think ants idea should be tried though, it's a cool concept
2010-12-11T09:31:29  <antimatroid1> added an edit on to mine
2010-12-11T09:32:17  <antimatroid1> oh oh oh, and you should be able to pass harvest to a friend ant on your square
2010-12-11T09:32:23  <antimatroid1> which gets passed before moves are made
2010-12-11T09:35:10  <Meatkat> edited mine as well :P I like the sound of GLORIOUS COMBAT
2010-12-11T09:36:46  <Meatkat> Alright, quite enough thinking of ants for me for one day
2010-12-11T09:36:47  <Meatkat> lates
2010-12-11T09:36:55  <antimatroid1> i have one more suggestion :P
2010-12-11T09:37:21  <antimatroid1> if you kill an enemy, you automatically get all their harvest, if that is more than you can carry, that adds to whatever can be harvested from that current square
2010-12-11T09:45:08  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: ow, not so loud--i have a head ache
2010-12-11T09:45:45  <antimatroid1> sorry, i think i worked out a set of rules that would work if implemented, it's with a separate process for each ant, but easily restrictable
2010-12-11T09:45:57  <antimatroid1> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1205&start=50

2010-12-11T18:20:28  <antimatroid1> i don't see why multiple processes is hard?

2010-12-11T18:21:44  <Meatkat> Processing an array of 1000 objects is much easier than processing 1000 threads, and multiply that by # games played, etc....
2010-12-11T18:22:13  <antimatroid1> sure, but we don't need 1000's of ants
2010-12-11T18:22:28  <antimatroid1> i think 20 ants per team would be pushing it maybe

2010-12-11T18:23:07  <antimatroid1> delt0r was planning, my post was meant to be one that a prototype could be made from, but no one is poking holes in it for me
2010-12-11T18:23:18  <antimatroid1> or discussing implementation details for the others either
2010-12-11T18:23:25  <Meatkat> Watching 20 ants fumble their way around a board != exciting
2010-12-11T18:23:26  <Frontier> pgpaskar_: lol, this is unicode
2010-12-11T18:23:33  <antimatroid1> Meatkat: you need to make moves for every ant within your turn
2010-12-11T18:23:39  <antimatroid1> and have bots not just be completely stupid
2010-12-11T18:24:13  <Frontier> Meatkat: but at least they can communicate with each other.

2010-12-11T18:24:25  <Meatkat> Meatkat: indeed
2010-12-11T18:24:55  <Meatkat> I'm just saying the more ants the more interesting it will be to watch
2010-12-11T18:25:07  <Meatkat> which was a large draw for PW, IMHO
2010-12-11T18:25:10  <Frontier> so the idea of teamwork is coming across. 1000 ants would be more awesome of course. but you can't handle that in seperate processes
2010-12-11T18:25:33  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure you can expect people to deal with that in one process
2010-12-11T18:26:07  <Frontier> RoboCom hat board sizes of 10² to 30² - that would be 900 robots at max.
2010-12-11T18:26:17  <antimatroid1> what were time limits?
2010-12-11T18:26:18  <Meatkat> I'm sure there are plenty of good numbers between 20 and 1000s that we could choose...
2010-12-11T18:26:21  <Meatkat> :)
2010-12-11T18:26:48  <Meatkat> 20 makes me thing of more like a wolf pack or something though
2010-12-11T18:27:01  <Frontier> antimatroid1: you cannot compare them, they ran in an interpreter. time wasn't really a constraint.
2010-12-11T18:27:56  <antimatroid1> the bigger you make maps, the bigger the trade off between "cool looking games" and "interesting strategies"
2010-12-11T18:28:09  <antimatroid1> i'm a fan of the interesting strategies over anything else, not sure about everyone else
2010-12-11T18:28:57  <Meatkat> I'd say it's more of a map saturation thing that a map size
2010-12-11T18:28:57  <Frontier> I'd rather add a few walls than have 1000 ants instead of 20 considering the load on the server.
2010-12-11T18:29:55  <Meatkat> Yeah, 20 is definitely better for the server
2010-12-11T18:30:31  <Meatkat> I'm just playing DA here, I think the weak spot of the current iteration of ant wars is the 'wow' factor when watching games
2010-12-11T18:30:41  <antimatroid1> awww wtf? we did have 3 seconds on the first turn for planet wars
2010-12-11T18:30:43  <Meatkat> But I think PW will be hard to follow
2010-12-11T18:30:45  <antimatroid1> i was explicitly told we didn't
2010-12-11T18:30:58  <Frontier> Plan it small and increase the number of ants later if possible. If there is an average of 10 ants per player and they can each think for 0.5 sec the load on the server is already 5x if the turn number stays the same.
2010-12-11T18:31:23  <antimatroid1> tripling my first move time would have helped a lot for planet wars
2010-12-11T18:31:57  <Meatkat> I don't think most PW bots thought for .5 seconds... the limit should be a lot lower than that if they want to emphasis 'dumb' bots and emergent behaviours
2010-12-11T18:32:14  <antimatroid1> who is emphasising dumb bots?
2010-12-11T18:32:18  <Meatkat> But that's a good point, start small
2010-12-11T18:32:21  <antimatroid1> i'm out if people want to make dumb bots

2010-12-11T18:33:07  <antimatroid1> i'm a little annoyed that 3 seconds was given on first turn yet stated otherwise
2010-12-11T18:33:25  <Frontier> Meatkat: even worse - if 'beginners' bots think for 0.1 sec as a rule of thumb that will just scale directly (x10) to the ant game
2010-12-11T18:33:33  <burny> the extra tiem on first turn, was for allocating memory, instatiating the java VM, etc.
2010-12-11T18:33:40  <antimatroid1> Frontier: all bots work off wall time
2010-12-11T18:34:01  <antimatroid1> so you just use timers and tell all ants to return "no move" if they run out of time
2010-12-11T18:34:22  <antimatroid1> burny: iouri said in the forums he was able to get the game state and work for 3 seconds
2010-12-11T18:34:23  <burny> ant: you had zero board info, during that 3seconds
2010-12-11T18:34:37  <burny> or, they lied
2010-12-11T18:34:41  <Frontier> antimatroid: Do all (maybe 20) processes run at the same time in your 'vision'?
2010-12-11T18:35:06  <antimatroid1> Frontier: yes, one bot's processes are KILLed for the other bots turn, then resumed once it's their turn again
2010-12-11T18:35:19  <antimatroid1> they get a second (atm) to all return their move
2010-12-11T18:36:15  <sigh> antimatroid1: you had 2 seconds for your program to start up, then you were fed first turn info after which you had 1 sec
2010-12-11T18:36:35  <Frontier> hmm ok. i didn't like that idea in the first place, but i wont argue. (in particular you can't expect the operating system to share cpu time evenly across the processes)
2010-12-11T18:36:36  <antimatroid1> sigh: iouri claims otherwise

2010-12-11T18:37:51  <antimatroid1> it doesn't change anything now, but it's a screw up
2010-12-11T18:37:56  <janzert> I don't know didn't ever really do much if anything with the actual engine code

2010-12-11T18:38:07  <antimatroid1> i'm not pointing fingers :P
2010-12-11T18:38:29  <Frontier> I would run one ant after the other and give each 100 ms to respond
2010-12-11T18:38:57  <antimatroid1> Frontier: yep, that would be best i think
2010-12-11T18:39:27  <antimatroid1> that means we can attempt to go off cpu time too
2010-12-11T18:39:37  <Meatkat> Did you guys time your PW bots? Just curious on timings.
2010-12-11T18:39:53  <antimatroid1> yes, i pretty much always used most of my second
2010-12-11T18:40:09  <antimatroid1> game trees will do that
2010-12-11T18:40:21  <janzert> I think next time there should be no specification just a pointer to the engine code :)

2010-12-11T18:41:47  <antimatroid1> i think two of the most important things about this contest are
2010-12-11T18:41:48  <antimatroid1> 1. it's easy for new people to come in and get started, yet the games are quite complex
2010-12-11T18:41:48  <antimatroid1> 2. you can pretty much use any language you want

2010-12-11T18:44:44  <sigh> you can treat it as "internal" to the bots
2010-12-11T18:44:46  <antimatroid1> only part of it

2010-12-11T18:45:37  <antimatroid1> why not just have the information assume all bots that can see each other can communicate in their own language?
2010-12-11T18:45:44  <antimatroid1> and give each bot updated information based on that
2010-12-11T18:45:59  <antimatroid1> it's a lot easier to do, and gets rid of string messages
2010-12-11T18:45:59  <janzert> on other thing is so far the contest has always used a pre-existing game, this has a whole bunch of advantages
2010-12-11T18:46:10  <sigh> janzert: agree
2010-12-11T18:46:17  <sigh> i'm a bit iffy about show

2010-12-11T18:46:32  <antimatroid1> planetwars was kind of new, it was a new variation

2010-12-11T18:48:15  <sigh> yeah, that's reasonable

2010-12-11T18:48:46  <Frontier> that is so simple and yet it wasnt in planet wars ^
2010-12-11T18:48:55  <sigh> also, if someone hasn't mentioned it... all constants defining the game should be fed in at the start
2010-12-11T18:48:58  <Zannick> i will put that in the engine

2010-12-11T18:49:54  <antimatroid1> i think that should be fed before receiving "ready"
2010-12-11T18:49:56  <Frontier> Zannick: probably log, when a bot isn't ready within 3 seconds and kill it then
2010-12-11T18:50:22  <antimatroid1> that way people can allocate all their memory etc. before any turns
2010-12-11T18:50:41  <antimatroid1> Frontier: you ever time out on a turn and you lose the game
2010-12-11T18:50:43  <antimatroid1> i think that's reasonable
2010-12-11T18:50:45  <sigh> antimatroid1: either way, it will help alliviate the stress about hard coding in game lengths and timeouts etc
2010-12-11T18:51:08  <Zannick> Frontier: i was planning on that, too

2010-12-11T18:53:47  <Frontier> If the fov was a radius of 9 and a a square could be represented in 2 bits and a compressor could reduce that to 30% and we could use 7-bits in the communication strings, it would all fit in 24 bytes :-).
2010-12-11T18:54:03  <antimatroid1> well i'm going to start throwing together pieces for a prototype
2010-12-11T18:54:10  <antimatroid1> i have nothing better to do today
2010-12-11T18:54:33  <antimatroid1> what are peoples thoughts on the home home?
2010-12-11T18:54:41  <antimatroid1> i really like that
2010-12-11T18:54:46  <Frontier> home hole?
2010-12-11T18:54:50  <antimatroid1> but i think wall creation needs to be added then
2010-12-11T18:55:37  <Frontier> It is a strategic bonus to win by capturing the hive, like sending 7 migs to the enemy construction yard in C&C red alert was.
2010-12-11T18:55:38  <antimatroid1> all your ants spawn from "home" where your queen is, if there is harvest there at the end of a turn, 1 ant is made from 1 of the grains, then when you harvest grains, you return them home
2010-12-11T18:55:44  <antimatroid1> and can pass them to your friends
2010-12-11T18:56:09  <antimatroid1> if you get one of your ants into their home, you win (or draw if it's done at the same time as them)
2010-12-11T18:56:43  <Frontier> is it faster to pass grains on, or to walk all the way yourself?
2010-12-11T18:57:05  <antimatroid1> you can send one ant home then, and the others can go get more grain
2010-12-11T18:57:46  <Frontier> So they split into harvesters and carriers than, nice idea.
2010-12-11T18:58:33  <antimatroid1> i think wall creation should be left out
2010-12-11T18:58:49  <antimatroid1> and line symmetric maps always used, so you don't just know where their home is
2010-12-11T18:59:47  <Frontier> Symmetry is a must I guess, although that gives you insight into how the enemy base is laid out.
2010-12-11T18:59:59  <antimatroid1> that's my point, use line symmetry and you don't
2010-12-11T19:00:06  <antimatroid1> but keep it symmetric
2010-12-11T19:00:23  <Frontier> line symmetry is a mirror, right?
2010-12-11T19:00:43  <antimatroid1> hmmm, maybe i can't do what i did with planet wars maps on a discrete board?
2010-12-11T19:01:26  <antimatroid1> okay, simple fixed, we'll have the map generator pick between which way to mirrow
2010-12-11T19:01:28  <Frontier> either way you will know what the enemy base looks like. where their spice is relative to their home hole, because it is just mirrored from yours
2010-12-11T19:01:39  <Frontier> ok
2010-12-11T19:01:41  <antimatroid1> mirror*, then you don't necessarily know where they are, but may have some idea
2010-12-11T19:02:15  <antimatroid1> you can do quite a few possible mirrorings
2010-12-11T19:02:39  <Frontier> Why would I want to go for any spice other than the closest to my hive?
2010-12-11T19:02:50  <antimatroid1> you don't see the whole map
2010-12-11T19:03:03  <antimatroid1> only what's in each ant's field of view
2010-12-11T19:03:31  <antimatroid1> i'm planning to send each ant the most recently known information to it of the map each turn
2010-12-11T19:04:03  <SmkMnstr> anyone wanna work on real ai instead of an ai chalenge
2010-12-11T19:04:12  <antimatroid1> define real ai
2010-12-11T19:04:18  <SmkMnstr> well semi real ai at least
2010-12-11T19:04:24  <antimatroid1> define semi real ai
2010-12-11T19:04:29  <SmkMnstr> something that RESEMBLES the star trek computer interface
2010-12-11T19:04:38  <Frontier> that's fine I guess. But once I know that a spice location is the closest to my base I wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
2010-12-11T19:04:53  <antimatroid1> frontier: until you harvest everything there
2010-12-11T19:05:06  <SmkMnstr> so i can tpye a query like
2010-12-11T19:05:27  <SmkMnstr> "Computer, What's the capital of California?"
2010-12-11T19:05:41  <antimatroid1> is it really any different?
2010-12-11T19:06:00  <antimatroid1> how do you plan to do it? just interpret text and look up answers?
2010-12-11T19:06:05  <antimatroid1> how is that any more aiey?
2010-12-11T19:06:30  <SmkMnstr> its the begining for ai
2010-12-11T19:06:43  <SmkMnstr> mimic this interface, learn stuff, do it better
2010-12-11T19:06:45  <antimatroid1> i find these problems much more interesting than say knowledge systems
2010-12-11T19:06:48  <SmkMnstr> im not sure when it will get to actual reasoning
2010-12-11T19:07:36  <SmkMnstr> ok well i can respect that

2010-12-11T19:09:16  <SmkMnstr> here is an inspiration towards reasoning i made awhile ago
2010-12-11T19:09:17  <SmkMnstr> http://onegrandcircle.com/~justin/timeisit.cpp
2010-12-11T19:09:45  <SmkMnstr> uses CYC like triplets to answer question "what time is it", except not really, but it demonstrates the idea
2010-12-11T19:10:15  <virdo> SmkMnstr: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=What's+the+capital+of+California%3F -- scrape / OCR this :)
2010-12-11T19:10:23  <SmkMnstr> i made up some random stuff like "is-a, as-a dereferencing" and some other idea, that let you process these triples, anyway just throwing out
2010-12-11T19:11:35  <Frontier> antimatroid1: ...until I harvest everything and move on to the next closest spice. It *might* be the most effective way to play the ant game.
2010-12-11T19:11:36  <SmkMnstr> i can imagine how to do some basic structured information extraction revolving aroudn the word 'is'
2010-12-11T19:11:41  <SmkMnstr> for basic querys like that
2010-12-11T19:13:14  <virdo> Noone really commented about this : http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1223 -- does it mean the idea is generally unliked?
2010-12-11T19:13:21  <Frontier> WolframAlpha just looks for known words, like capital, California, red, ... : http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=You+commited+a+capital+delict+in+California%21
2010-12-11T19:13:36  <antimatroid1> hmmm, here's an interesting idea, if all ants spawn on the same square, how do you get them all to do something different?
2010-12-11T19:13:39  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure you can
2010-12-11T19:13:55  <antimatroid1> not deterministically anyway
2010-12-11T19:14:07  <Frontier> It doesn't say "Sorry, I don't understand" :)
2010-12-11T19:14:25  <SmkMnstr> heh yeah
2010-12-11T19:14:39  <antimatroid1> maybe you should start with 5 grains in the home base, so you get a new ant every turn for the first 5 turns
2010-12-11T19:14:48  <antimatroid1> so they can make their choicese based off seeing their friends
2010-12-11T19:15:37  <Frontier> antimatroid: the queen is a bot itself and can decide on which of the 4 sides it will spawn an ant. :p
2010-12-11T19:16:41  <antimatroid1> i would consider blocking off 3 sides of home bases by default
2010-12-11T19:17:00  <Frontier> as a directed entrance?
2010-12-11T19:17:20  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-12-11T19:17:31  <antimatroid1> just put walls on the sides

2010-12-11T19:19:25  <Frontier> or make it look like an ant hill with the cave entrance on one side
2010-12-11T19:20:17  <Frontier> How about some textures for the terrain, home holes and spice? Hmm...
2010-12-11T19:20:50  <Frontier> I'm not a texture artist, but I would love to see MY textures in the game ^^
2010-12-11T19:22:01  <antimatroid1> i'm not handling graphics :P
2010-12-11T19:28:34  <antimatroid1> oh, here's an idea, have people also submit a second bot for "bullets" then you can fire a bullet at an enemy ant within view of you, and it has no choice but to make a move every turn, if it goes out of view of it's target, it dies, if it hits another bot, that bot gets hurt
2010-12-11T19:29:08  <antimatroid1> that would be too hard to do i think, fun idea
2010-12-11T19:29:19  <Frontier> i leave that up to the forum :)

2010-12-11T19:32:25  <Frontier> I'm still thrilled by the idea of creating a large scale programming game in outer space with people (or maybe space trolls or something), interceptors, and larger interplanetary ships that can be assembled from predefined modules like fleet hangar, room for landing troops, defenses, and thrusters.
2010-12-11T19:32:55  <antimatroid1> hmmm, atm we're outputting the same information to both bots yeah? how do we output different things to each process?
2010-12-11T19:33:21  <Frontier> at the moment (planetwars) we already change the player ids
2010-12-11T19:33:41  <antimatroid1> ah, that is true
2010-12-11T19:33:41  <Zannick> the engine figures it out (tm)
2010-12-11T19:34:36  <antimatroid1> why not just let the bots be told what their player number is?
2010-12-11T19:35:24  <sigh> everyone wants to be #1
2010-12-11T19:35:33  <Frontier> antimatroid1: that could have been done, but in the ant game you need to send different information to every ant anyway.
2010-12-11T19:36:01  <antimatroid1> frontier: yes, my point is the code is confusing if you're also swapping player numbers around
2010-12-11T19:36:04  <antimatroid1> but meh
2010-12-11T19:36:58  <Frontier> I dont think anyone is going mad if you change it so that the REAL player id is sent. It only confused me when I was debugging.
2010-12-11T19:37:36  <Frontier> my engine thought "player 2" and my bot thought "player 1". this always ends up in confusing logs ^^
2010-12-11T19:38:00  <antimatroid1> yeah, you could also open a different debug file dependent on your player number then as well
2010-12-11T19:59:27  <antimatroid1> how does one define a 2d vector in pythong?
