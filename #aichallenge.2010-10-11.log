2010-10-11T00:06:34  <pjreddie> alright, someone please explain what the deal is? i am at wit's end. http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=7530 I just tested my bot on a 100ms time limit on every map, I don't time out, i don't crash, i don't fail to start. why all these losses on the first turn? does anyone have any idea what the issue could be?
2010-10-11T00:07:00  <blbrown_win3_> pjreddie, check that you aren't outputting logging to stdout
2010-10-11T00:07:49  <blbrown_win3_> pjreddie, you won some games there
2010-10-11T00:08:09  <pjreddie> i know
2010-10-11T00:08:13  <pjreddie> that's what makes no sense
2010-10-11T00:08:28  <pjreddie> it's like sometimes it's fine
2010-10-11T00:08:34  <pjreddie> and sometimes it just fails me
2010-10-11T00:08:55  <pjreddie> no std out, no file writing.
2010-10-11T00:08:59  <blbrown_win3_> whenever I lose, it is when I printed some logging or had some print stack trace (java) and didn't intend for it.
2010-10-11T00:10:45  <blbrown_win3_> and then again, the other guy may have crashed
2010-10-11T00:11:41  <Zannick> c++, right?
2010-10-11T00:11:44  <Zannick> bad pointer access?
2010-10-11T00:11:51  <blbrown_win3_> pjreddie, this guy one, but it says his app crashed.  haha.  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5736348
2010-10-11T00:12:00  <pjreddie> don't really play with pointers
2010-10-11T00:12:13  <Zannick> uninitialized memory?
2010-10-11T00:12:19  <Zannick> stderr?
2010-10-11T00:12:31  <Zannick> :/
2010-10-11T00:12:37  <blbrown_win3_> ...won
2010-10-11T00:12:45  <Zannick> stack overflow?
2010-10-11T00:12:55  <pjreddie> blbrown_win3_: that happens a lot, the visualizer always says it's player 1's fault but the win/loss is supposed to be right
2010-10-11T00:12:58  <sigh> stderr? why would that be a problem?
2010-10-11T00:13:10  <Zannick> sigh: not on the first turn, generally

2010-10-11T00:13:32  <Zannick> but the engine doesn't read from stderr, so you fill up the pipe and then you deadlock trying to print to it
2010-10-11T00:13:50  <sigh> ah, ok that makes sense
2010-10-11T00:14:03  <Zannick> saw one person with that problem
2010-10-11T00:14:17  <blbrown_win3_> what is that, a linux/os issue?
2010-10-11T00:14:36  <Zannick> what, the logging to stderr?
2010-10-11T00:15:00  <blbrown_win3_> well, the deadlock printing to stderr
2010-10-11T00:15:12  <Zannick> no, that's pretty standard afaik
2010-10-11T00:15:13  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~delt0r@188-22-167-223.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2010-10-11T00:15:23  <Zannick> the output function waits for the pipe to be able to receive more
2010-10-11T00:15:28  <Zannick> rather than just failing
2010-10-11T00:15:39  <pjreddie> i have no output whatsoever
2010-10-11T00:15:55  <sigh> that might be a problem :P
2010-10-11T00:16:17  <Zannick> i hope you mean besides issueorder and finishturn
2010-10-11T00:16:25  <blbrown_win3_> hehe
2010-10-11T00:16:27  <pjreddie> well ya
2010-10-11T00:18:19  <pjreddie> i just don't like that i can't duplicate it on my computer
2010-10-11T00:18:25  <Zannick> do you use asserts?
2010-10-11T00:18:37  <pjreddie> if i could, i could track down whatever it is
2010-10-11T00:19:15  <janzert> might try to replicate the server environment as close as you can, Ubuntu 8.04 and I believe 32bit
2010-10-11T00:19:16  <Zannick> only if it tripped on your system
2010-10-11T00:19:47  <Zannick> 32 bit, use the same compile flags, etc etc.
2010-10-11T00:19:57  <Zannick> not much more i can suggest :/
2010-10-11T00:20:12  <pjreddie> hm, good call, lemme do that
2010-10-11T00:21:20  <pjreddie> where does it give compile flags for c++ entries?
2010-10-11T00:22:02  <Zannick> here, i'll just say them
2010-10-11T00:22:12  <Zannick> -O3 -funroll-loops -c
2010-10-11T00:22:17  <Zannick> -O2 -lm
2010-10-11T00:22:49  <Zannick> it's in the repo: trunk/planet_wars/backend/compile_anything.py
2010-10-11T00:24:29  <amstan> Zannick: what was it before?
2010-10-11T00:24:44  <Zannick> amstan: what do you mean?
2010-10-11T00:25:01  <amstan> Zannick: your changes, what were they before you changed them?
2010-10-11T00:25:41  <Zannick> i didn't really change anything, i refactored it to look nicer and not be one giant series of ifs
2010-10-11T00:25:48  <amstan> oh, ok
2010-10-11T00:25:54  <Zannick> but it should resolve some compile problems with, eg, C
2010-10-11T00:26:12  <Zannick> the function wasn't returning a value so everyone is getting rejected
2010-10-11T00:26:24  <Zannick> issue 193 points to the branch, btw
2010-10-11T00:27:45  <janzert> I have tested it locally as well btw
2010-10-11T00:31:59  <Zannick> yeah, i think tomorrow if no one else adds anything to the review i'll merge to trunk
2010-10-11T00:35:33  <antimatroid> hmmm, another argument against people running their own files is their ability to change their file as the tournament progresses
2010-10-11T00:36:54  <janzert> ?
2010-10-11T00:37:15  <antimatroid> people were talking at one time about allowing people to run their bots like on tcp
2010-10-11T00:37:18  <antimatroid> for the actual tournament
2010-10-11T00:37:27  <antimatroid> and throw out contraining time limits
2010-10-11T00:37:32  <antimatroid> constraining*
2010-10-11T00:37:35  <Zannick> yeah, too easy to break all the rules
2010-10-11T00:37:45  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=youwillfail nice start :)
2010-10-11T00:37:56  <antimatroid> i made a couple of tweaks
2010-10-11T00:45:23  <antimatroid> it's still on 100% :)
2010-10-11T00:45:41  <antimatroid> and he's finally claimed 1 on tcp
2010-10-11T00:45:49  <antimatroid> i hope he does as well on the main site aha
2010-10-11T00:48:28  <antimatroid> awww, stupid bot lost a game :(
2010-10-11T00:49:03  <pjreddie> damn
2010-10-11T00:49:10  <pjreddie> i'd hoped i'd face you
2010-10-11T00:49:18  <pjreddie> wanted to be the first to win
2010-10-11T00:49:23  <pjreddie> (if i win)
2010-10-11T00:49:24  <antimatroid> i lost 2 in a row
2010-10-11T00:49:32  <Zannick> spoke too soon D:
2010-10-11T00:49:42  <pjreddie> eh, you had quite the streak
2010-10-11T00:50:00  <antimatroid> it's not aggressive enough at tracking to the centre when necessary
2010-10-11T00:50:18  <sigh> tracking to the center
2010-10-11T00:50:19  <sigh> ?
2010-10-11T00:50:54  <antimatroid> when you start a fair distance away, if you let them claim more territory they can hold, they're going to win

2010-10-11T01:02:59  <pjreddie> alright. compiled with all the flags, and -m32 for good measure. tested on all maps w/ 50ms timeout. it can't be timeout. why else could i get disqualified sometimes on the first turn
2010-10-11T01:04:09  <Zannick> and it's saying timeout/crash/no start
2010-10-11T01:04:31  <pjreddie> ya
2010-10-11T01:05:08  <Zannick> best i can guess is a crash or early exit
2010-10-11T01:05:10  <blbrown_win3_> Zannick, aren't the admins on this irc channel.  Could the admins printout what happens for pjreddie games
2010-10-11T01:05:18  <blbrown_win3_> I am kind of curious, myself
2010-10-11T01:05:35  <blbrown_win3_> I bet they have logging on their end
2010-10-11T01:05:38  <Zannick> blbrown_win3_: amstan's the only one with access here, very few admins are not active
2010-10-11T01:05:48  <amstan> yo?
2010-10-11T01:05:51  <blbrown_win3_> see
2010-10-11T01:05:57  <Zannick> i know danielvf has done that before but he's not here
2010-10-11T01:06:02  <pjreddie> amstan: you around? i would love to know why this is happening if possible
2010-10-11T01:06:02  <Zannick> er
2010-10-11T01:06:07  <Zannick> very few admins are active
2010-10-11T01:06:25  <blbrown_win3_> pjreddie, ask amstan
2010-10-11T01:06:41  <amstan> i've never done this before actually
2010-10-11T01:07:10  <blbrown_win3_> there is no game id or something and the logging associated with that game
2010-10-11T01:07:11  <amstan> pjreddie: are you trying to open network sockets, write to files, or make threads?
2010-10-11T01:07:17  <pjreddie> nope
2010-10-11T01:07:24  <Zannick> and i don't know where the logs go, on disk or in the database
2010-10-11T01:07:25  <pjreddie> checked all that
2010-10-11T01:07:35  <amstan> pjreddie: what language are you using?
2010-10-11T01:07:39  <pjreddie> c++
2010-10-11T01:07:52  <amstan> any special features in ther? did you mod the IO library?
2010-10-11T01:08:02  <pjreddie> haha no it's pretty simple
2010-10-11T01:08:17  <amstan> you get the same problems on all games?
2010-10-11T01:08:25  <pjreddie> no
2010-10-11T01:08:26  <Zannick> hm
2010-10-11T01:08:30  <pjreddie> only some
2010-10-11T01:08:33  <Zannick> have you tested as both player 1 and player 2?

2010-10-11T02:26:15  <jmcarthur> i don't think being able to change your bot as the tournament progresses would be all that bad
2010-10-11T02:26:38  <jmcarthur> it's not like you can make all your past games not count that way

2010-10-11T02:27:19  <brx> that kind of defeats the point.

2010-10-11T03:42:04  <Frontier> pjreddie: I would test your bot if that is ok. My system should be quite similar to the servers at the moment. 32-bit Linux. As long as the language is Java, C/C++ or Python I can run it and I have my own game server software so I can easily debug the first round with the illegal move.

2010-10-11T04:42:56  <Frontier> Acount, write your own PlayGame. Then you put your bot right into your PlayGame and have it super fast. Usually 150x faster than PlayGame.jar and three processes.

2010-10-11T04:45:23  <Frontier> Acount: Yes it is written in C++, but has code for spawning sub-processes (external bots) that is Linux specific

2010-10-11T04:56:52  <Frontier> Also you have to compile with the define "WITH_SERVER", otherwise you get only a usual RageBot for use with PlayGame.jar.
2010-10-11T04:58:32  <Acount> Frontier> best will be java PlayGame.jar whith fixed 100% procecoor loading bug

2010-10-11T05:00:38  <Frontier> Believe me, nothing is better than havin an own server+bot in one exe. It is so much faster and easier to debug. For example you can focus debugging on round 45 then.
2010-10-11T05:02:40  <Acount> Frontier> need standart outpit like  PlayGame.jar  and standard command line syntax
2010-10-11T05:04:02  <Frontier> Well, as I don't use PlayGame.jar any more I made up my own command line syntax, which does more stuff than PlayGame.jar
2010-10-11T05:05:05  <Frontier> For example you can say "MyBot -1 YourBot -2 RageBot DualBot -m maps/*" to run your bot against RageBot and DualBot on all maps.
2010-10-11T05:05:29  <Frontier> But I really think you are better of looking for this other C++ version of PlayGame.jar
2010-10-11T05:05:38  <Acount> Frontier> standart outpit like  PlayGame.jar ?
2010-10-11T05:06:09  <Frontier> It does that... I just don't remember what triggers it... wait.
2010-10-11T05:07:32  <Frontier> Acount: It does that when you play exactly one match. That is when you set up one bot for player 1, one bot for player 2 and one map.
2010-10-11T05:09:05  <Frontier> It goes one step further: I made it so that I can say: "MyBot -2 RageBot -m maps/map1.txt -e 2" to get default output for round 2 and later.

2010-10-11T07:38:39  <Frontier> Especially when it comes to neutrals in the center I see some bots relay their ships so that their opponent doesn't realize they head for the neutral, and once it is captured the relayed ships come into play and take it for a cheap price.

2010-10-11T08:46:20  <fluffluff1> :D
2010-10-11T08:47:07  <nrub> I wonder if that
2010-10-11T08:47:16  <nrub> is the optimal strategy when you start so close
2010-10-11T08:47:50  <Naktibalda> distance is 2, right?
2010-10-11T08:48:18  <nrub> yeah
2010-10-11T08:48:26  <nrub> map 428
2010-10-11T08:49:06  <nrub> haha checking map statistics, it has a 17% draw rate
2010-10-11T08:50:23  <Naktibalda> a lot of dumb bots
2010-10-11T08:50:35  <Naktibalda> 83% :)
2010-10-11T08:56:12  <Meatkat> where do you find the map statistics?
2010-10-11T08:56:36  <nrub> http://72.44.46.68/getmaps
2010-10-11T08:57:46  <Meatkat> and with that map, is there an optimal move? You can only afford to send out 10 ships from your planet on turn 1, and if the enemy doesn't send out ten as well you are going to lose
2010-10-11T08:58:23  <nrub> not necissarily
2010-10-11T08:58:54  <Meatkat> If you send out more than 10, then enemy will take your home planet and you are screwed
2010-10-11T08:59:01  <Meatkat> at least he will if he didn't send out 10
2010-10-11T08:59:44  <nrub> yeah but what if you send only ten and he saves his? He will still not be able to take your planet
2010-10-11T09:00:05  <Meatkat> But you can't take over any of the neutrals with 10 ships
2010-10-11T09:00:11  <Meatkat> and now you can't send out anymore
2010-10-11T09:00:15  <Meatkat> and all he has to do is sit tight and he wins
2010-10-11T09:00:17  <nrub> true
2010-10-11T09:00:34  <Meatkat> So the optimal move is to do nothing

2010-10-11T09:00:38  <nrub> if there had been a neutral with only 9 ships in defense maybe it could be done
2010-10-11T09:01:01  <Meatkat> indeed
2010-10-11T09:01:59  <Meatkat> of if there were starting planets with higher regen than your starting planet
2010-10-11T09:02:15  <Meatkat> they'd have to be a lot higher to make loosing your home planet worth it though
2010-10-11T09:03:09  <Naktibalda> starting planet has fixed growth_rate = 5
2010-10-11T09:07:41  <Meatkat> but is the max growth_rate always 5?

2010-10-11T11:51:51  <rabidus> back to AI :)
2010-10-11T11:52:18  <Migi32> it issues invalid orders and that's why it's rank 3000 but still, he's staging attacks etc
2010-10-11T11:52:39  <Migi32> assuming Acount and Accoun are the same guy, but it's twice a misspelling of Account so I think so :P
2010-10-11T11:52:46  <jmcarthur> i have no doubt that he's a reasonable programmer, but either he's just a very rude person or something is very seriously getting lost in translation to his native tongue

2010-10-11T11:55:19  <cfaftw> if somebody issues an invalid order, it seems that it is an automatic win for that bot

2010-10-11T12:02:04  <rabidus> but... can it be more than ... lets say, 50 ?
2010-10-11T12:02:09  <amstan> greghaynes: you're afk too much!
2010-10-11T12:02:12  <rabidus> oh man
2010-10-11T12:02:19  <Migi32> jmcarthur, sure. But irc op or forum op? I've never been either and I don't visit the forums too often though...
2010-10-11T12:02:27  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i was suggesting for irc
2010-10-11T12:02:30  <amstan> Migi32: irc
2010-10-11T12:02:32  <Migi32> ok
2010-10-11T12:02:37  <rabidus> my subset function is going to fail badly
2010-10-11T12:02:48  <amstan> though.. i'm not sure, i didn't see him much, no offense
2010-10-11T12:03:06  <Migi32> no problem amstan, I understand :)
2010-10-11T12:03:29  <jmcarthur> i only suggested Migi32 because he mentioned ops earlier (wasn't asking for it, just mentioning that there should be more)
2010-10-11T12:03:48  <amstan> oh, ok, that's op material then
2010-10-11T12:04:01  <amstan> jmcarthur: as for mods on the forums, i was thinking of just giving everyone who has medal of honour op powers
2010-10-11T12:04:12  <jmcarthur> i guess that could work
2010-10-11T12:04:23  <Migi32> what's a medal of honour?
2010-10-11T12:04:27  <jmcarthur> i don't frequent the forums very often though
2010-10-11T12:05:12  <Zannick> i get tired of reading the forums
2010-10-11T12:05:17  <amstan> i just gave people that helped in various ways a special status on the forum
2010-10-11T12:05:25  <amstan> yeah, they're horrible, lol
2010-10-11T12:05:38  <Zannick> because so many people have technical problems with the server and there aren't enough admins working on them
2010-10-11T12:05:47  <Zannick> it's disheartening
2010-10-11T12:05:48  <Zannick> :/
2010-10-11T12:05:56  <amstan> strategy and misc forums are more interesting
2010-10-11T12:06:00  <jmcarthur> Migi32: since you haven't opped irc before, here are some tips for if amstan gives you ops (some of it is specific for #haskell, but still good to read) http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel/Management
2010-10-11T12:06:02  <amstan> Zannick: but yeah, i have the same feeling
2010-10-11T12:06:10  <JamesMG> I like strategy sometimes, yeah
2010-10-11T12:06:13  <Zannick> i would totally be an admin but i want to play in this contest...maybe next one
2010-10-11T12:06:20  <jmcarthur> yeah the forums are majority "me too" posts or duplicates
2010-10-11T12:07:13  <amstan> mods will have the power to organize those posts..
2010-10-11T12:07:15  <cfaftw> posting "me too" like some brain-dead AOLer. I should do the  world a favor and cap you like old yeller. you're just about as useless as JPEGs to Hellen Keller
2010-10-11T12:07:27  <Zannick> cfaftw: :D
2010-10-11T12:07:29  <JamesMG> haha

2010-10-11T12:07:50  <jmcarthur> that's weird al
2010-10-11T12:07:51  <amstan> Zannick: you can still be op and mod
2010-10-11T12:08:02  <amstan> just no ssh access
2010-10-11T12:08:05  <Zannick> sure, sure

2010-10-11T15:38:07  <pjreddie> it went after the 50 too in the middle, wasted a lot of ships right during the critical battle
2010-10-11T15:38:17  <rebelxt> agreed, attacking 80 neutral was not the right thing to do. but it was also a bad idea to attack 1-growth planet with 281 ships. probably the same issue i have with my scoring function..

2010-10-11T16:07:28  <Titankiller> itis distance same as number of turns

2010-10-11T16:17:15  <jmcarthur> that's an overloaded ^2 though. looks weird wrapped in sqrt :P

2010-10-11T17:29:06  <javagamer> Will make it a lot easier to stay in the same place after every time I run it

2010-10-11T18:23:35  <McLeopold> ?
2010-10-11T18:23:40  <McLeopold> I need to look
2010-10-11T18:23:52  <McLeopold> How about tcp?  Did you beat CrowBot?
2010-10-11T18:24:25  <rebelxt> normally back and forth against crowbot. is it what you have on the official server?
2010-10-11T18:25:16  <McLeopold> No, totally different.
2010-10-11T18:25:24  <McLeopold> Official server is 1 month old.
2010-10-11T18:25:53  <McLeopold> Every time I make my bot better, my official bot beats me on some new scenario.
2010-10-11T18:26:04  <sigh> that's happening to everyone :)
2010-10-11T18:26:07  <rebelxt> yeah.. mine normally does better than crow on the tcp, but loses badly to your old bot on the official server ;-)
2010-10-11T18:26:26  <McLeopold> The old one doesn't do good on tcp anymore.
2010-10-11T18:26:38  <sigh> is crow supposed to be better than the one on official?
2010-10-11T18:26:46  <McLeopold> No
2010-10-11T18:26:53  <rebelxt> there is a special TCP breed of bots ;-)
2010-10-11T18:27:00  <sigh> :)
2010-10-11T18:27:01  <McLeopold> It will beat official on some maps, but official is overall better.

2010-10-11T18:29:44  <rebelxt> yeah my official bots handles close starts properly for first 2 or 3 turns only.. it had hard-coded logic.. already re-factored though. hopefully improved ;-)
2010-10-11T18:29:54  <McLeopold> You were behind on growth for most of the game...
2010-10-11T18:30:31  <rebelxt> McLeopold: yeah that's a great example of falling behind on expansion...
2010-10-11T18:31:21  <McLeopold> It looks like that's what all your losses are, lower growth.
2010-10-11T18:31:40  <McLeopold> My official doesn't even know when it's behind, it just keeps expanding.
2010-10-11T18:32:04  <McLeopold> It usually loses when it expands to slowly or decides to expand to the enemy, but they have good defense.
2010-10-11T18:32:19  <sigh> mine just keeps expanding and loses when it expands too quickly :D
2010-10-11T18:33:13  <rebelxt> yep you nailed it. trying to get it improved on expansion front.. my bot over-estimates enemy's ability to play perfect game, hence it's not aggressive enough

2010-10-11T18:35:00  <Zannick> does the opposite of the opponent
2010-10-11T18:35:13  <McLeopold> Like CopyBot?

2010-10-11T18:35:44  <McLeopold> The coolest bot I've seen so far is Migi32's vortex.
2010-10-11T18:35:49  <Zannick> if you attack, it defends! if you defend, it attacks!
2010-10-11T18:36:03  <rebelxt> which version of vortex? he had so many running on tcp...
2010-10-11T18:36:13  <McLeopold> I've only seen the first.

2010-10-11T18:38:00  <McLeopold> or maybe that was 9-9

2010-10-11T18:38:10  <McLeopold> ah

2010-10-11T18:38:59  <McLeopold> It's like a masquerade party in there...
2010-10-11T18:39:38  <sigh> we need a command for contestbot to tell us who people are :)

2010-10-11T18:41:12  <Zannick> argggg
2010-10-11T18:41:56  <janzert> rebelxt: it used to give 3 seconds before the first game data was sent, but that has changed
2010-10-11T18:42:24  <janzert> I think now it gives one second before sending any data and two seconds for the first turn after sending the initial game data
2010-10-11T18:42:32  <Zannick> janzert: other way around
2010-10-11T18:42:45  <Zannick> afaik

2010-10-11T18:48:09  <janzert> yep, although I wouldn't be too surprised to find out that the main server was using the other version
2010-10-11T18:48:40  <Zannick> that would certainly explain the lack of error messages on some games
2010-10-11T18:49:33  <Zannick> actually, there's a way to tell
2010-10-11T18:49:42  <janzert> yes, I'm assuming that is because the error messages are actually created by the api_record_game.php and the main server is just writing directly to the database still

2010-10-11T20:05:52  <amstan> i have no idea, lol
2010-10-11T20:06:27  <McLeopold> I'll have to test it out.  My thought is that there should be some better checks for map generation.
2010-10-11T20:06:31  <sigh> how does bayeselo treat draws?
2010-10-11T20:06:57  <McLeopold> sigh: you get to choose, I'm not sure what the official server uses.
2010-10-11T20:07:32  <McLeopold> tcp uses the advantage 0 command, and I'm not totally certain how that affects it.
2010-10-11T20:08:52  <McLeopold> default is 0.5 points for each
2010-10-11T20:09:30  *** rebelxt <rebelxt!~apinkin@24-155-144-5.static.grandenetworks.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-10-11T20:09:46  <McLeopold> If we only used 1 map ever, then the draw prob would be easy.
2010-10-11T20:10:06  <McLeopold> The problem is, different maps have different draw probs.
2010-10-11T20:10:15  <sigh> for this game, it doesn't seem like draws give much information about the players
2010-10-11T20:10:21  <sigh> more about the maps than anything
2010-10-11T20:10:30  <McLeopold> Usually 0% or 100% once we get really good bots.
2010-10-11T20:10:44  <sigh> it might be worth ignoring drawn games?
2010-10-11T20:10:51  <sigh> non-trivial draws are rare
2010-10-11T20:10:56  <McLeopold> yeah, but say you submit a new bot and play an average bot first time, and get a draw map
2010-10-11T20:10:56  <Zannick> i think i've seen 30% used before
2010-10-11T20:11:12  <Zannick> like, win=1, lose=0, draw=0.3 points
2010-10-11T20:11:41  <McLeopold> Zannick: the points can't be adjusted to get a good result if it's a bad map
2010-10-11T20:11:54  <Zannick> no

2010-10-11T20:22:55  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i would guess that it is likely to skew results
2010-10-11T20:23:10  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: because a draw implies that the opponents are more similar in skill
2010-10-11T20:24:02  <a1k0n> draw maps were a much bigger problem last time
2010-10-11T20:24:02  <jmcarthur> oh right, bayeselo doesn't even treat draws as special. they are just different scores
2010-10-11T20:24:34  <jmcarthur> draw maps are still probably not good to have
2010-10-11T20:24:35  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: if it could know that 1 particular match had a draw prob of 100%, then it would be okay
2010-10-11T20:24:46  <jmcarthur> even if they don't *skew* the results, they would at least slow down convergence
2010-10-11T20:25:13  <jmcarthur> yeah i don't think that's possible
2010-10-11T20:25:24  <McLeopold> My thought is that after the "great reset", if you are unlucky enough to get a draw map, you're screwed.
2010-10-11T20:25:26  <jmcarthur> i honestly don't know much about how bayeselo works though
2010-10-11T20:25:38  <jmcarthur> not necessarily screwed
2010-10-11T20:25:38  <a1k0n> i think i've seen maybe one legitimate draw so far
2010-10-11T20:25:52  <jmcarthur> you could be paired against a top 10 opponent and draw
2010-10-11T20:25:57  <jmcarthur> still, not fair
2010-10-11T20:26:10  <McLeopold> I've seen a few legitimate, where both bots just choose the same strategy.
2010-10-11T20:26:28  <McLeopold> 2 top bots on a draw map are okay
2010-10-11T20:26:36  <McLeopold> a top bot against a bad bot on a draw map is not
2010-10-11T20:27:12  <McLeopold> It probably might not matter, but I'd rather not have to calculate if it would.
2010-10-11T20:27:47  <a1k0n> but what is a 'draw map'?  they're all draw maps at some point
2010-10-11T20:28:16  <McLeopold> a1k0n: I've got a good definition here: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=424&p=5928#p5928

2010-10-11T22:52:41  <amstan> i did
2010-10-11T22:52:56  <amstan> M      compile_anything.py
2010-10-11T22:53:04  <Zannick> ah
2010-10-11T22:53:46  <Zannick> hm, not in my logs, but thanks
2010-10-11T22:54:06  <amstan> yeah, i didn't give it exactly for compile anything
2010-10-11T22:54:10  <amstan> i probably missed it

2010-10-11T23:01:31  <sigh> 
2010-10-11T23:01:37  <sigh> sorry :(
2010-10-11T23:02:36  <Zannick> anyway, could you commit that file? or send me a diff?
2010-10-11T23:02:58  <amstan> Zannick: how do i svn diff?
2010-10-11T23:03:24  <Zannick> svn diff compile_anything.py > compile.diff
2010-10-11T23:03:27  <dmj111>  sigh: yeah.... who knows... it may be a flop.

2010-10-11T23:04:11  <amstan> that's all
2010-10-11T23:04:21  <sigh> dmj111: how does it fare against your other versions?
2010-10-11T23:04:26  <Zannick> i see
2010-10-11T23:05:53  <dmj111> sigh: well... it wins 59, loses 37, ties 4 with the sept 23rd bot (1.8 on tcp)
2010-10-11T23:05:58  *** epona <epona!~Jack@c-71-203-102-88.hsd1.fl.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-10-11T23:06:11  <amstan> dmj111: do you want op and mod powers?
2010-10-11T23:06:12  <dmj111> it has done ok on tcp, although lovebot owns it.
2010-10-11T23:06:32  <dmj111> amstan: _want_ is a strong word, but I am willing if you need help.
2010-10-11T23:06:48  <dmj111> saw the fireworks this morning :)
2010-10-11T23:06:55  <Zannick> hm, danielvf make a change 2 days ago
2010-10-11T23:06:57  <Zannick> interesting
2010-10-11T23:07:04  <Zannick> amstan: thanks!
2010-10-11T23:07:17  <dmj111> sigh: my test setup isn't great yet... so I haven't tried much else.
2010-10-11T23:07:17  <Zannick> that's actually good, as that change is already in trunk
2010-10-11T23:07:22  <sigh> cool, it'll be interesting to see how it does... your bots always seem to manage to stay steady in the top 10 regardless of what other bots do :P
2010-10-11T23:07:50  <dmj111> thanks.  I'm not sure how this previous one was up there, with those losses it took.
2010-10-11T23:08:14  <sigh> haha, yeah... rocky start but it clawed its way up pretty good
2010-10-11T23:08:25  <sigh> as I said, that bug with the neutrals doesn't matter at the top
2010-10-11T23:08:38  <dmj111> i think I added it back into this new version :)
2010-10-11T23:08:43  <sigh> :)
2010-10-11T23:08:55  <Zannick> so i will go ahead and push the compile cleanup to trunk
2010-10-11T23:09:17  <dmj111> this is mostly a rewrite.  well, it used the utilities from dmj_exp to reimplement the logic from dmj1.8.
2010-10-11T23:09:34  <dmj111> there are a few issues I know about... but may as well test it while i can.
2010-10-11T23:09:48  <sigh> i see

2010-10-11T23:42:16  <Zannick> that's really beside the point here, because they went for the center
2010-10-11T23:42:30  <Zannick> and only the center
2010-10-11T23:43:12  <sigh> yeah... but still, attacking an 87 ship 0-growth planet
2010-10-11T23:43:17  <Zannick> yeah

2010-10-11T23:43:52  <sigh> I'm guessing bad 0 growth handling
2010-10-11T23:44:04  <Zannick> probably went for the least instead of the greatest
2010-10-11T23:45:01  <sigh> well, I'm making the assumption that people will have run their bots locally where a complete reversal of evaluation is usually obivous :P
2010-10-11T23:45:05  <sigh> but you never know
2010-10-11T23:46:22  <sigh> hmmm... copybot is getting its share of wins
2010-10-11T23:46:42  <sigh> are they legit, or mostly timeouts/illegal moves
2010-10-11T23:46:48  <Zannick> handful of each
2010-10-11T23:46:55  <Zannick> generally pretty bad bots
2010-10-11T23:47:23  <Zannick> http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5797082
2010-10-11T23:48:14  <sigh> oh, it's not exact copy
2010-10-11T23:48:29  <Zannick> no, exact copy is guaranteed loss
2010-10-11T23:49:32  <sigh> yeah, one day people had a big argument in here about copybot so I put an exact-copy bot on tcp and showed how much it sucked
2010-10-11T23:49:41  <Zannick> hahaha
2010-10-11T23:49:46  <sigh> even loses to ragebot
2010-10-11T23:49:47  <Zannick> i had it do that for awhile
2010-10-11T23:50:02  <Zannick> my copybot loses to ragebot
2010-10-11T23:50:16  <Zannick> except on maps with home planet distances >= 20
2010-10-11T23:50:31  <sigh> so how does it decide how many ships to send?
2010-10-11T23:50:32  <Zannick> even vanilla copybot will do that
2010-10-11T23:51:05  <Zannick> it adds the growth rate of the planet to the fleets it sends from that planet
2010-10-11T23:51:23  <sigh> source growth rate?
2010-10-11T23:51:29  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-11T23:51:39  <sigh> fair enough
2010-10-11T23:51:52  <sigh> explains why it is like 600 elo points above the bottom
2010-10-11T23:51:52  <Zannick> so 5 for 1 fleet, 5/2 (2) for two fleets, etc.
2010-10-11T23:51:57  <Zannick> heh
2010-10-11T23:52:20  <Zannick> it's not very good and i don't want to improve it
2010-10-11T23:52:20  <Zannick> :P
2010-10-11T23:52:29  <sigh> :)
2010-10-11T23:56:36  *** cfaftw <cfaftw!~cfaftw@pool-72-66-77-9.washdc.fios.verizon.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-11T23:56:39  <pjreddie> Ok. this is getting ridiculous. I have nothing in my code. I literally commented everything out from DoTurn except the return statement, and it still fails on the first turn http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5811957
2010-10-11T23:57:07  <pjreddie> what could possibly make this happen?
2010-10-11T23:57:22  <Zannick> did you change anything else anywhere?
2010-10-11T23:57:29  <jesionaj> doesnt look like you uploaded that version
2010-10-11T23:57:40  <cfaftw> pjreddie, what language?
2010-10-11T23:57:52  <jesionaj> wait, sorry, looked at wrong persons profile
2010-10-11T23:59:04  <pjreddie> c++
2010-10-11T23:59:56  <pjreddie> i've been having this unexplained, 1st turn fail for a while so i started commenting out sections, now everything is commented out
