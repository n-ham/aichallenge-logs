2012-04-17T18:15:50  <mcstar> i wanted to do this, cause it provides with pixel precision collision detection
2012-04-17T18:16:33  <mcstar> but it still needs a tad better physics, and i probably will add elastic collisions on any objects too
2012-04-17T18:16:52  <mcstar> and ofc, IO if i want to connect bots to it
2012-04-17T18:17:23  <thestinger> I'll try it in a bit :)

I think I made an account a few years ago, but I cannot remember what the account name or password might be, and I know it's against the rules to have multiple accounts. Is it safe to make a new one (I am not even sure I made one to begin with, last time I looked at the page was a year-ish ago) or is there someone to contact?
2012-04-17T18:55:00  <mcstar> that rule doesnt apply between contests
2012-04-17T18:56:43  <janzert> wallaceg: every contest so far has used a new account and is also separate from the forum accounts
2012-04-17T18:57:30  <janzert> since no contest is active right now you can only start a forum account at the moment anyway
2012-04-17T18:57:40  <wallaceg> Okay thanks! Didn't want to make a new one and risk getting banned. In the middle of class (had a small break) so gotta go. But thanks again!
