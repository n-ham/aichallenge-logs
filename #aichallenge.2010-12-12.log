2010-12-12T00:17:59  * antimatroid likes list comprehensions
2010-12-12T00:18:13  <antimatroid> def make_map(X, Y):
2010-12-12T00:18:14  <antimatroid> 	return [ [0 for y in range(Y)] for x in range(X) ]
2010-12-12T00:18:14  <antimatroid> that's just cool
2010-12-12T00:23:04  <antimatroid> Frontier: what are you using as a shift for greek?
2010-12-12T00:33:00  <Zannick> :)
2010-12-12T00:33:06  <Zannick> yeah, list comprehensions are great
2010-12-12T00:34:42  <antimatroid> i'm not sure how to then iterate over my lists though :\
2010-12-12T00:35:53  <Zannick> yeah, you end up having lists of lists
2010-12-12T00:36:26  <Zannick> you can do 'for yrow in map: for y in yrow:'
2010-12-12T00:36:53  <Zannick> or you can do 'for x in range(len(map)):' at the top level to have an index
2010-12-12T00:37:16  <antimatroid> yeah got it, but how do i print a list on one line?
2010-12-12T00:37:29  <Zannick> print map
2010-12-12T00:37:35  <antimatroid> if i print the list i get brackers, if i iterate through, it adds enter after every element
2010-12-12T00:37:51  <Zannick> put a , at the end of the print statement to suppress the newline
2010-12-12T00:37:58  <antimatroid> ah, cool :)
2010-12-12T00:38:00  <Zannick> so print "no newline",
2010-12-12T00:38:11  <antimatroid> (i've only ever used python for these map engines)
2010-12-12T00:38:25  <Zannick> i remember you said that
2010-12-12T00:39:20  <antimatroid> got it, cheers
2010-12-12T00:47:47  <Frontier> antimatroid: I use Alt Gr as the modifier in my 'normal' layout to access the Greek symbols. Shift is additional to access the upper case letters
2010-12-12T00:49:53  <antimatroid> Frontier: cheers, i might look for another app later, i don't even know how to tell the other one to map to greek
2010-12-12T00:50:01  <antimatroid> it wants me to push a button to map to ehe
2010-12-12T00:50:14  <antimatroid> i'm making an ant map generator atm though

2010-12-12T01:08:11  <sigh> Zannick: if you want to iterate over a list with an index, the more "pythonic" way is: for i,x in enumerate(xs)

2010-12-12T01:50:46  <Zannick> though you can do crazier constructs like dictionary mappings to functions
2010-12-12T01:51:27  <antimatroid> do you think ants should know how big the world is when they start?

2010-12-12T02:46:13  <Epona> ah
2010-12-12T02:46:27  <Epona> I was thinking of solving my multiprocessing problem
2010-12-12T02:46:34  <Epona> someone made an interesting idea
2010-12-12T02:46:55  <Epona> to just code for multiple while statements, in just one while statement

2010-12-12T02:47:34  <Epona> making multiple infinate loops would be nicer
2010-12-12T02:55:31  <antimatroid> i think this ant game can actually work really well
2010-12-12T03:00:01  <Epona> I can't wait to see it?
2010-12-12T03:00:03  <Epona> !
2010-12-12T03:00:43  <antimatroid> i'm still fine tuning how to make maps
2010-12-12T03:00:47  <antimatroid> then i'll get to work on an engine
2010-12-12T03:00:54  <antimatroid> i'm going to need someone else to do a gui though
2010-12-12T03:01:05  <antimatroid> but hopefully a prototype can be going some time

2010-12-12T03:38:04  <delt0r_> antimatroid: hay... havn't read anything on the forums... just coding up a ant version now. Without locked combat (really don't like that)
2010-12-12T03:38:57  <antimatroid> delt0r_: i've almost got a map generator for you
2010-12-12T03:39:11  <delt0r_> what format are you using
2010-12-12T03:39:25  <antimatroid> have you read about the home hole idea?
2010-12-12T03:39:31  <antimatroid> i really like that, and it provides a spawn point
2010-12-12T03:39:40  <delt0r_> no
2010-12-12T03:39:50  <delt0r_> won't till this version is done.
2010-12-12T03:39:52  <sigh> you guys should set up a git repo so that you can stay in sync
2010-12-12T03:40:12  <delt0r_> simple idea is that once we have something runing we can try different rulesets
2010-12-12T03:40:22  <delt0r_> sigh: yea
2010-12-12T03:40:28  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/FiEkYOYZ
2010-12-12T03:40:31  <antimatroid> that's the map gen so far
2010-12-12T03:40:31  <delt0r_> once i have a basic game i may do
2010-12-12T03:40:50  <antimatroid> gah hang on, it timed out when running
2010-12-12T03:41:20  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/Cx2KgcNU
2010-12-12T03:41:34  <antimatroid> there is an example map at the bottom of that page (i need to work out why that timed out too)
2010-12-12T03:42:03  <antimatroid> a and b represent the home holes, # walls and numbers how much grain can be harvested from that square
2010-12-12T03:45:00  <delt0r_> cool
2010-12-12T03:45:10  <delt0r_> format is about the same as what i was doing too
2010-12-12T03:45:39  <antimatroid> i'm going to run some ideas by you for this first implementation
2010-12-12T03:47:17  <antimatroid> an ant can: move, harvest, deposit,give (grains to friend bot), fight on a given turn
2010-12-12T03:47:17  <antimatroid> an ant is generated at the home home (by queen bee) if there is at least 1 grain on the home hole square, the hole starts with 5 grains
2010-12-12T03:47:17  <antimatroid> an ant can fight an enemy ant that is within x distance, if they land on the same square, they automatically fight to the death
2010-12-12T03:47:26  <Epona> this is pretty amazing looking, antimatroid
2010-12-12T03:47:35  <antimatroid> an ant can only do one of those things in a turn
2010-12-12T03:47:51  <antimatroid> and friend ants can be in the same square
2010-12-12T03:48:25  <delt0r_> I still don't like overlaping ants... and locked combat... it pulls the dynamics down too much
2010-12-12T03:48:33  <delt0r_> you lose chooice
2010-12-12T03:48:52  <antimatroid> you can completely remove forced combat
2010-12-12T03:49:24  <antimatroid> but i don't know how you handle them landing in the same square and resolving who gets to harvest if not enough is left
2010-12-12T03:49:35  <delt0r_> just no overlaps
2010-12-12T03:49:44  <delt0r_> ie nothing on the same square
2010-12-12T03:49:50  <antimatroid> it's hard to resolve that
2010-12-12T03:49:55  <delt0r_> no its not
2010-12-12T03:49:55  <antimatroid> and spawning is very hard
2010-12-12T03:50:02  <delt0r_> its about 4 lines of code
2010-12-12T03:50:35  <antimatroid> it also means people are going to "waste" turns by accident
2010-12-12T03:50:39  <delt0r_> I also am still doing the single process per player
2010-12-12T03:50:55  <antimatroid> i prefer separate processes
2010-12-12T03:51:05  <delt0r_> its ai challenge... stupid ants will lose
2010-12-12T03:51:05  <antimatroid> maybe i'll write a second engine, and we can compare :)
2010-12-12T03:51:31  <delt0r_> well I still thing when we what 4000 entries to all have a few 100 games...
2010-12-12T03:51:54  <delt0r_> having ~16+ process per game is going to be hard work
2010-12-12T03:52:04  <delt0r_> and thats not many
2010-12-12T03:52:22  <delt0r_> I would prefer lots of ants to a game with only 2 or 3
2010-12-12T03:52:55  <delt0r_> getting to work at one game at a time is not the same as working on the main server
2010-12-12T03:53:19  <delt0r_> Imagine a tcp version --each process with a separate socket?
2010-12-12T03:54:22  <antimatroid> delt0r_: the idea is to have each process fed the game state sequentially, and each ant given a set amount of time to return their move
2010-12-12T03:54:36  <antimatroid> then process them as though they were made simultaneously
2010-12-12T03:54:49  <delt0r_> yea--and how small can you make that relaibly... and what about tcp?
2010-12-12T03:54:51  <antimatroid> and KILL each nonused process, resuming it on its turn
2010-12-12T03:55:11  <delt0r_> Still a *lot* of overhead... these are not threads
2010-12-12T03:55:12  <antimatroid> i don't know how tcp works sorry :P
2010-12-12T03:55:31  <delt0r_> well currently it would requre a new tcp connection per process
2010-12-12T03:55:33  <antimatroid> it sucks if all ants have the same info
2010-12-12T03:55:49  <antimatroid> may be unavoidable
2010-12-12T03:56:00  <delt0r_> ie every new ant would need seconds to connect (tcp takes a 4 way ping for a connection)
2010-12-12T03:56:17  <delt0r_> antimatroid: they still only get relative info for where they are
2010-12-12T03:56:38  <antimatroid> yes, but you can't stop people from programming the ants to share information
2010-12-12T03:56:43  <antimatroid> or can you?
2010-12-12T03:57:05  <antimatroid> if it can be done, it doesn't work to say "don't do that"
2010-12-12T03:57:09  <delt0r_> but feel free to do the 100 process version... will work fine locally... but good luck supporting that once you get 1000+ entries and everyone is complaining about not getting any games... or debug data
2010-12-12T03:57:21  <delt0r_> does it really matter....
2010-12-12T03:57:27  <delt0r_> if they share...
2010-12-12T03:57:38  <delt0r_> Think enders game...
2010-12-12T03:57:40  <antimatroid> no, my point is one process means we have to go with that
2010-12-12T03:57:44  <delt0r_> think cyber ants
2010-12-12T03:57:53  <delt0r_> thy will have wireless
2010-12-12T03:57:53  <antimatroid> i do think we should use strings now
2010-12-12T03:58:01  <antimatroid> but i think it should be private information to the program
2010-12-12T03:58:08  <antimatroid> people watching games don't get to see strings
2010-12-12T03:58:08  <delt0r_> yes!
2010-12-12T03:58:25  <delt0r_> simpler to implement and manage from the organisers point of view.
2010-12-12T03:58:53  <antimatroid> okay, well i'm still going to write my own engine, but i'll do it for single process
2010-12-12T03:59:01  <antimatroid> and we can see what works best once they're done
2010-12-12T03:59:01  <delt0r_> I think a single process per player is by far the best way... from that aspect
2010-12-12T03:59:18  <delt0r_> are you going to use python?
2010-12-12T03:59:32  <antimatroid> yes
2010-12-12T03:59:40  <antimatroid> i don't think communication is needed
2010-12-12T03:59:49  <delt0r_> ??
2010-12-12T04:00:03  <antimatroid> if people are handling all their bots at once, they all have each others information, you can just pass them the game state for each ant
2010-12-12T04:00:12  <delt0r_> yes
2010-12-12T04:00:16  <antimatroid> for all ants* updated on the one map
2010-12-12T04:00:20  <Epona> so, the bot can only use the methods there?
2010-12-12T04:00:36  <antimatroid> Epona: ?
2010-12-12T04:00:57  <Epona> Im just not sure I understand how this code works yet
2010-12-12T04:01:32  <delt0r_> I know the idea of "agents" is nice --buts its very artificial from a application perspective --and i think a lot of overhead from a game engine perspective
2010-12-12T04:01:33  <antimatroid> it's not even written, patience
2010-12-12T04:02:17  <antimatroid> i still don't like moves being blocked
2010-12-12T04:03:10  <delt0r_> its important from visulisation, debug, and simple symatics behavour...
2010-12-12T04:03:24  <delt0r_> wehn you have 4 ants from 2 teams what happens?
2010-12-12T04:03:37  <antimatroid> fight two weakest or two strongest first
2010-12-12T04:03:41  <delt0r_> easyer to avoid the problem alltogether i think
2010-12-12T04:03:51  <antimatroid> you still have that problem now
2010-12-12T04:04:03  <antimatroid> what if you ants attack an ant with 1 hp left?
2010-12-12T04:04:15  <delt0r_> and then there is all the support from post of "WTF" --where players don't understand these rules
2010-12-12T04:04:15  <antimatroid> two* ants attack
2010-12-12T04:04:26  <delt0r_> the ant dies
2010-12-12T04:04:28  <delt0r_> what?
2010-12-12T04:04:40  <antimatroid> and you waste 2hp? or does attack not cost you anything?
2010-12-12T04:04:52  <delt0r_> the attack cost nothing
2010-12-12T04:05:11  <delt0r_> i don't expend bullets with a club ;)
2010-12-12T04:05:20  <delt0r_> well it cost movement
2010-12-12T04:06:09  <antimatroid> i would process fight before moves, so if you find an enemy in the required range, they are still there when it's processed
2010-12-12T04:06:24  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-12T04:06:47  <delt0r_> fight, remove the dead, move, resolve collisons... done
2010-12-12T04:09:04  <delt0r_> lets just get the dam things runing
2010-12-12T04:09:19  <delt0r_> think it will become clear whats stupid and what not at that point

2010-12-12T04:27:54  <antimatroid> that could work
2010-12-12T04:27:57  <delt0r_> just location
2010-12-12T04:28:01  <delt0r_> no hp
2010-12-12T04:28:24  <delt0r_> prefer to be case insensitive
2010-12-12T04:28:27  <antimatroid> the other option is to have them take lines like
2010-12-12T04:28:27  <antimatroid> A 1 4 0 0
2010-12-12T04:28:37  <antimatroid> ant, player 1, 4 hp, x, y
2010-12-12T04:28:41  <antimatroid> then they fill info in
2010-12-12T04:29:07  <antimatroid> W 1 1
2010-12-12T04:29:07  <antimatroid> R 6 0 0
2010-12-12T04:29:08  <antimatroid> etc.
2010-12-12T04:29:19  <antimatroid> and you just pass them relevant information
2010-12-12T04:29:50  <delt0r_> yea --but if you have a lot of walls... mmm don't know whats best here...
2010-12-12T04:30:05  <delt0r_> whats easiest to code? for a player? I think a grid perhaps?
2010-12-12T04:30:36  <antimatroid> atm i would be planning a map, but not storing ants on there at all
2010-12-12T04:30:43  <antimatroid> they will be their own queue
2010-12-12T04:30:46  <antimatroid> or vector
2010-12-12T04:31:03  <delt0r_> they are... but "combining" them is not difficult
2010-12-12T04:31:27  <antimatroid> yeah, it will probably end up a vector<vector<Square> > or something
2010-12-12T04:31:31  <delt0r_> stabbing quires on a sparse grid is O(1)
2010-12-12T04:31:50  <antimatroid> ants shouldn't be able to see through walls either, around is fine
2010-12-12T04:31:56  <antimatroid> it's easy to work out information for that
2010-12-12T04:31:59  <delt0r_> thats hard
2010-12-12T04:32:04  <antimatroid> no its not
2010-12-12T04:32:07  <delt0r_> its hard becuase what is around etc
2010-12-12T04:32:09  <delt0r_> code it then
2010-12-12T04:32:15  <antimatroid> i will
2010-12-12T04:32:29  <delt0r_> and watch the 100 of people claiming that its all wrong with edge cases
2010-12-12T04:32:54  <antimatroid> you just add each ants position to a stack, and take a blank new one, paint out till you can't do any more within vision radius, then return the map with those positions updated
2010-12-12T04:33:35  <antimatroid> blank new one while looking at walls on original map
2010-12-12T04:33:55  <delt0r_> los even on a grid is a pain and somewhat aritarty too (antialisaed vision?)
2010-12-12T04:34:26  <antimatroid> ?
2010-12-12T04:34:28  <delt0r_> especially with single cell blockers
2010-12-12T04:34:45  <antimatroid> i'll write the code and we can see how horrible it is
2010-12-12T04:35:06  <antimatroid> def distance(loc1, loc2):
2010-12-12T04:35:07  <antimatroid> 	d1 = abs(loc1[0] - loc2[0])
2010-12-12T04:35:07  <antimatroid> 	d2 = abs(loc1[1] - loc2[1])
2010-12-12T04:35:07  <antimatroid> 	return min(d1, dim[0]-d1) + min(d2, dim[1]-d2)
2010-12-12T04:35:07  <antimatroid> that's my distance function with wrapped edges, is that right?
2010-12-12T04:35:32  <antimatroid> without counting walls
2010-12-12T04:35:45  <delt0r_> also the amount of "unkown" info is now much larger and harder too track

2010-12-12T04:57:41  <antimatroid> ha, interesting idea for turbo charged tron, each square is randomly assigned a number, the number on the square you just landed on is the number of moves you are allowed to make up to, you have to move at least 1 square

2010-12-12T05:14:25  <antimatroid> delt0r_: i have another idea to simplify, bots can't be on the same square, but have the home squares, whenever an ant harvests something, that automatically means the queen will generate another ant next turn the home base is empty
2010-12-12T05:14:37  <antimatroid> or even require harvest to be returned
2010-12-12T05:14:51  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-12T05:15:13  <delt0r_> like RTS games... harvesting can be immediate or the peons need to return it
2010-12-12T05:15:38  <antimatroid> and queen either has hp 1 or whatever, and if they kill your queen, you lose
2010-12-12T05:15:40  <delt0r_> I like the idea of return it... but then the bar for a basic entry is getting set a bit higher...
2010-12-12T05:15:45  <delt0r_> yep
2010-12-12T05:15:58  <antimatroid> i like it, and it means you need to do an updated version of shortest path back to base
2010-12-12T05:16:01  <delt0r_> then there is the idea of protecting the queen
2010-12-12T05:16:04  <antimatroid> i'd put in return to begin with
2010-12-12T05:16:19  <antimatroid> yeah, home base should be important

2010-12-12T05:16:33  <antimatroid> the idea is to start them a decent distance apart so they can sort of set their own strategies up
2010-12-12T05:16:42  <antimatroid> then they'll start finding each other and the battles can behin
2010-12-12T05:16:46  <antimatroid> begin*
2010-12-12T05:17:26  <antimatroid> i think i might make all maps square, so i can do more symmetries easily, atm their home base pretty much has to be 1 of 3 known locations
2010-12-12T05:18:11  <antimatroid> with a square board i can make that more like 7 i think

2010-12-12T06:21:34  <antimatroid> i can't get this is_valid function working :\
2010-12-12T06:21:44  <Epona> you seem to be hacking at this game pretty hard
2010-12-12T06:24:03  <antimatroid> i want to work it out
2010-12-12T06:24:12  <antimatroid> but this is just the map generator
2010-12-12T06:24:42  <Epona> if only there was a simpler language
2010-12-12T06:24:59  <antimatroid> i don't get to choose the language for map gen
2010-12-12T06:25:10  <sigh> simpler?
2010-12-12T06:26:14  <Epona> more graphic would be nicer
2010-12-12T06:26:25  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2010-12-12T06:26:36  <antimatroid> sigh: feel like reading some python code for me? :P
2010-12-12T06:26:40  <Epona> like most video games have really powerful engines
2010-12-12T06:26:51  <sigh> sure, what do you want me to look for?
2010-12-12T06:27:13  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/n7rOdVXG
2010-12-12T06:27:40  <antimatroid> that's the code, function is_valid on line 95 fails
2010-12-12T06:28:05  <Epona> why does the second and third print statement have nothing after it
2010-12-12T06:28:08  <antimatroid> i know i should start from 0, but even if i run it like is, it outputs the path it's trying to follow each step, and doesn't follow all directions
2010-12-12T06:28:11  <sigh> what does it do wrong?
2010-12-12T06:28:13  <Epona> ive never seen that
2010-12-12T06:28:29  <antimatroid> run it
2010-12-12T06:28:29  <antimatroid> mapgen.py >> map.txt
2010-12-12T06:28:33  <antimatroid> and watch the output
2010-12-12T06:28:44  <antimatroid> you will have to cancel the process most likely
2010-12-12T06:29:11  <sigh> you only follow 3 directions, is that right?
2010-12-12T06:29:22  <sigh> i = 1,2,3
2010-12-12T06:29:29  <antimatroid> it's meant to search out from home1 looking for home2, but it only ever does 2 directions
2010-12-12T06:29:33  <antimatroid> and it should do 3
2010-12-12T06:30:18  <antimatroid> it should also do all 3 additions to the map before checking the stack for which lock to look from next
2010-12-12T06:30:22  <antimatroid> which it doesn't do :\
2010-12-12T06:30:28  <Epona> antimatroid?
2010-12-12T06:30:56  <antimatroid> Epona: it's giving me an \n character
2010-12-12T06:30:59  <sigh> eh? how do you know when you;ve visited a node?
2010-12-12T06:31:10  <antimatroid> because I have nMap with 0 and 1's
2010-12-12T06:31:13  <antimatroid> 1 means i have visited it
2010-12-12T06:31:19  <antimatroid> oh, that or should be an and too
2010-12-12T06:31:24  <antimatroid> that was just me fucking around
2010-12-12T06:31:29  <antimatroid> elif map[nLoc[0] ][nLoc[1] ] != '#' and nMap[nLoc[0] ][nLoc[1] ] == 0:
2010-12-12T06:31:37  <sigh> ah, that makes more sense :)
2010-12-12T06:31:52  <antimatroid> it still doesn't work then though :\
2010-12-12T06:32:45  <antimatroid> it wraps all 4 edges properly i'm pretty sure
2010-12-12T06:34:53  <sigh> ok, i'll try running it
2010-12-12T06:35:40  <antimatroid> it will infinite loop, so don't leave it running for ages :)
2010-12-12T06:36:44  <sigh> doesn't inf loop for me
2010-12-12T06:36:50  <antimatroid> ever?
2010-12-12T06:36:55  <antimatroid> what if you put in i=0?
2010-12-12T06:37:11  <sigh> ok, I got an inf loop now
2010-12-12T06:37:40  <antimatroid> it can depend on which symmetry it picks as to whether you hit the other home or not
2010-12-12T06:38:28  <sigh> line 70
2010-12-12T06:38:44  <sigh> change to: nLoc = list(loc)
2010-12-12T06:38:50  <antimatroid> does that copy the reference?
2010-12-12T06:39:17  <sigh> yes, you aren't creating a new list atm
2010-12-12T06:40:15  <antimatroid> i think that did it

2010-12-12T06:46:40  <antimatroid> they actually start quite close, a is at the end of line 19, b at the start of 24
2010-12-12T06:46:49  <sigh> why do you only go though 3 directions?
2010-12-12T06:46:59  <antimatroid> i am meant to do 4
2010-12-12T06:47:08  <antimatroid> that was just testing
2010-12-12T06:47:22  <antimatroid> that link above^^ does 4
2010-12-12T06:47:39  <antimatroid> it has a 32x32 grid for you too
2010-12-12T06:49:16  <antimatroid> a choice needs to be made
2010-12-12T06:49:16  <antimatroid> 1. all square grids with more symmetries
2010-12-12T06:49:16  <antimatroid> 2. 3 symmetries and rectange grids
2010-12-12T06:53:51  <antimatroid> delt0r___: when you pass us the game state, can you distinguish a square that is empty from one that is not currently seeable?
2010-12-12T06:54:11  <delt0r___> I am not doing "sight"
2010-12-12T06:54:22  <delt0r___> but yes you would have to do that
2010-12-12T06:54:57  <delt0r___> otherwise all clients will need to dupilicate the los test so i can "know" about what it can't see
2010-12-12T06:57:57  <antimatroid> yep :)
2010-12-12T07:02:50  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/VoUkxUsO
2010-12-12T07:02:51  <antimatroid> that's a much more dense map
2010-12-12T07:03:34  <antimatroid> maybe a little too dense, i think quite a few regions got cut off, but players home bases are guarnteed to be reachable
2010-12-12T07:03:38  <antimatroid> from each other
2010-12-12T07:04:48  <sigh> antimatroid: since you were complaining about lack of switch earlier... here's how I would do the direction stuff: http://codepad.org/cG4Tqm56
2010-12-12T07:05:05  <sigh> as a bonus it makes it really easy to add more directions (like NE)
2010-12-12T07:06:58  <antimatroid> cheers
2010-12-12T07:09:49  <antimatroid> i think i might be able to make it so every square is accessible
2010-12-12T07:09:55  <antimatroid> i will try that and see how it looks
2010-12-12T07:10:06  <antimatroid> every non-wall square that is
2010-12-12T07:10:43  <sigh> yeah, that's simple with the code you've already got
2010-12-12T07:10:56  <antimatroid> might take slightly longer, but doesn't really matter
2010-12-12T07:11:10  <antimatroid> other option is to fill blocked off regions before adding in grains
2010-12-12T07:11:12  <sigh> not much longer
2010-12-12T07:11:43  <antimatroid> that way it'd be more like working your way around underground passages?
2010-12-12T07:12:29  <sigh> if the walls are placed randomly, you aren't going to have many blocked off areas
2010-12-12T07:12:40  <sigh> unless you are placing a lot more walls than now
2010-12-12T07:13:45  <antimatroid> i think dead end are good?
2010-12-12T07:14:08  <antimatroid> i'll try the first one and see how it looks
2010-12-12T07:14:36  <sigh> dead ends are fine, but that doen't have much to do with unreachable regions
2010-12-12T07:16:26  <antimatroid> yep
2010-12-12T07:16:41  <antimatroid> would just require larger maps for similarly interesting maps

2010-12-12T07:57:59  <antimatroid> Epona: if you didn't realise, you're allowed to go off the top and come out on the bottom, same with the sides
2010-12-12T07:58:05  <antimatroid> sigh: yeah, i'll fix that now
2010-12-12T07:58:14  <antimatroid> i'm adding more symmetries
2010-12-12T07:59:04  <Epona> pseudo infinity
2010-12-12T08:00:09  <sigh> unbouned != infinite -_-
2010-12-12T08:00:18  <sigh> *unbounded
2010-12-12T08:00:33  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/cTZQLnR1
2010-12-12T08:00:38  <antimatroid> fixed, with one more symmetry added
2010-12-12T08:00:42  <antimatroid> transpose
2010-12-12T08:01:31  <sigh> cool
2010-12-12T08:01:53  <antimatroid> i think i can do another 3 combinations of those
2010-12-12T08:02:03  <antimatroid> but cbf working them out atm
2010-12-12T08:04:15  <sigh> yeah, there are 8 symettries in all for a square (including identity)
2010-12-12T08:05:31  <antimatroid> yeah, and identity doesn't work obviously
2010-12-12T08:05:52  <sigh> ants aren't allowed to stack anymore? :P
2010-12-12T08:06:13  <antimatroid> am i right that you have to have either 1,2 or 4 players for a 2d symmetric game?
2010-12-12T08:06:34  <antimatroid> well, home base on top of each other wouldn't work :P
2010-12-12T08:06:54  <sigh> you can have 8 as well
2010-12-12T08:07:06  <sigh> assuming a square grid
2010-12-12T08:07:07  <antimatroid> not with home bases
2010-12-12T08:07:38  <sigh> why not?
2010-12-12T08:09:06  <sigh> there is no limit, as long as you can tile the board appropriately

2010-12-12T08:10:36  <sigh> don't need to
2010-12-12T08:11:23  <sigh> for example, think about a torus... put 1 person for each cardinal direction on top, and similarly on the bottom
2010-12-12T08:11:50  <sigh> if the torus is made from a square then all 8 points are symettrical
2010-12-12T08:11:58  <antimatroid> :S :P
2010-12-12T08:13:31  <antimatroid> i might post the current code in the forums and see what people think / get ideas
2010-12-12T08:13:49  <sigh> similarly, you could go to 16 players... torus is (circle x circle) so choose a different pair of cardinal directions for each player
2010-12-12T08:14:42  <antimatroid> yeah, that's true
2010-12-12T08:16:19  <sigh> anyway, stick to 2 player :P

2010-12-12T08:35:08  <antimatroid> it may actually be harder if ants can see through walls
2010-12-12T08:35:20  <antimatroid> because they may stupidly try to get to something they can't

2010-12-12T09:16:23  <antimatroid> i think it might need to be lines of info
2010-12-12T09:16:27  <amstan> antimatroid: it is really jeff's decision, i should go changing the main site like that

2010-12-12T09:16:57  <antimatroid> amstan: http://codepad.org/ugaRX7bA
2010-12-12T09:17:03  <antimatroid> check the bottom of the page
2010-12-12T09:17:45  <amstan> uh, so unpythonic
2010-12-12T09:17:52  <amstan> use classes man
2010-12-12T09:18:05  <antimatroid> haha sorry, it's done now
2010-12-12T09:19:10  <amstan> so what is this?
2010-12-12T09:19:36  <antimatroid> sample generator for ant wars
2010-12-12T09:19:41  <amstan> ic
2010-12-12T09:19:42  <amstan> ugh... you
2010-12-12T09:19:52  <antimatroid> 'a' and 'b' are home holes, # walls, and numbers grains
2010-12-12T09:19:53  <amstan> you're also using normal comments instead of the doc field
2010-12-12T09:19:57  <amstan> to document a function
2010-12-12T09:20:14  <antimatroid> it's the second thing i've written in python ever, give me a break :P
2010-12-12T09:20:34  <amstan> we should also consider using json for everything
2010-12-12T09:20:37  <antimatroid> sigh and frontier helped me work out syntax etc.
2010-12-12T09:20:49  <antimatroid> json?
2010-12-12T09:21:05  <amstan> yes
2010-12-12T09:21:52  <amstan> do you know what it is?
2010-12-12T09:21:59  <antimatroid> nope
2010-12-12T09:22:09  <amstan> sigh..
2010-12-12T09:22:19  <amstan> it's a thing that websites use a lot
2010-12-12T09:22:35  <antimatroid> i know nothing about websites :P
2010-12-12T09:22:36  <amstan> to transfer data, in arbitrary formats
2010-12-12T09:22:41  <antimatroid> or databases etc.
2010-12-12T09:22:49  <amstan> so.. you encode the data as a string
2010-12-12T09:22:56  <amstan> which also happens to be valid javascript
2010-12-12T09:23:06  <amstan> looks similar to python as well
2010-12-12T09:23:17  <amstan> so.. you can put cool stuff in it, like dicts, arrays, strings, numbers
2010-12-12T09:23:26  <amstan> without worrying about parsing it, formatting it and all that
2010-12-12T09:23:33  <antimatroid> i think we may have to stick to one process
2010-12-12T09:23:36  <amstan> there's libraries that read and write it for most major languages
2010-12-12T09:23:41  <amstan> huh?
2010-12-12T09:23:43  <antimatroid> which means all friend ants know what every other one does
2010-12-12T09:23:44  <delt0r___> parsing in anything outside js would be a pain though wouldn't it amstan
2010-12-12T09:23:54  <amstan> has nothing to do with processes
2010-12-12T09:24:02  <antimatroid> no, that was a separate comment sorry
2010-12-12T09:24:03  <amstan> delt0r___: python: import json
2010-12-12T09:24:15  <delt0r___> java? lisp? C++ ?
2010-12-12T09:24:24  <amstan> yep, they all have libraries
2010-12-12T09:24:27  <amstan> some of them built in
2010-12-12T09:24:30  <antimatroid> haskell?
2010-12-12T09:24:39  <amstan> and if not.. most implementations will be like 100 lines at most anyway
2010-12-12T09:24:51  <delt0r___> 3rd party lib support was underwhelming last time (on the server)
2010-12-12T09:24:58  <amstan> http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=haskell+json
2010-12-12T09:25:25  <amstan> delt0r___: we are rewriting from scratch anyway..
2010-12-12T09:25:34  <amstan> we should not hold back because of stuff from last time
2010-12-12T09:25:49  <amstan> the advantage is that we won't have parsing problems with the starter packages
2010-12-12T09:25:57  <amstan> it is still human readable, much easier to store
2010-12-12T09:26:02  <amstan> much easier for the visualizer to handle
2010-12-12T09:26:04  <delt0r___> well i just can't see "do you support lib X" getting all that much attention.
2010-12-12T09:26:29  <amstan> and.. the protocol can be extended live
2010-12-12T09:26:34  <amstan> without breaking older versions
2010-12-12T09:26:44  <amstan> hence the protocol can always be backwards compatible
2010-12-12T09:26:58  <amstan> a thing which is impossible using a made up format
2010-12-12T09:27:33  <antimatroid> it was cool that you could write your own bot with any language, just dealing with input/output, nothing else
2010-12-12T09:27:48  <amstan> yes, this is even better and easier
2010-12-12T09:27:55  <amstan> you don't have to know how the protocol works
2010-12-12T09:28:05  <amstan> and if your language doesn't have a json library.. you're doing it wrong
2010-12-12T09:28:26  <amstan> and you should not be worrying about this... that's the reason starter packages exist
2010-12-12T09:28:30  <antimatroid> what are you passing me? my data structs often end up looking very different to the starter packages
2010-12-12T09:28:54  <antimatroid> i'd rather be given input to process how i like
2010-12-12T09:28:54  <amstan> whatever you want?
2010-12-12T09:29:06  <amstan> ok.. like it's not hard to parse it as you like
2010-12-12T09:29:07  <antimatroid> (i don't really understand :P)
2010-12-12T09:29:16  <amstan> you might just break a few things though
2010-12-12T09:29:20  <amstan> here...
2010-12-12T09:29:33  <amstan> before: 1 2 3 4 5 6
2010-12-12T09:30:04  <amstan> after: "array" = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
2010-12-12T09:30:16  <amstan> darn... : not =
2010-12-12T09:31:07  <delt0r___> amstan: Don't get me wrong. A format formatting system is a real good idea.
2010-12-12T09:31:40  <delt0r___> but i do get sick of useing XML/newBetterThanXML/etc for simple things
2010-12-12T09:32:12  <amstan> but this is not simple
2010-12-12T09:32:18  <delt0r___> amstan: as for lanuage support. well again no problems there, as long as the main server is going to support it
2010-12-12T09:32:32  <amstan> you could have any kind of info that you can give to the bot and that it has to return
2010-12-12T09:32:38  <amstan> we cannot anticipate if there's more needs
2010-12-12T09:32:46  <delt0r___> we cannot
2010-12-12T09:32:48  <amstan> last time we needed to somehow pass max turns
2010-12-12T09:32:52  <amstan> we couldn't
2010-12-12T09:32:58  <amstan> because the protocol would not allow it
2010-12-12T09:33:03  <amstan> if we were using json we could have
2010-12-12T09:33:13  <amstan> one extra entry in the dict would not break other things
2010-12-12T09:33:22  <delt0r___> well i was thinking there can be a init message at the start... again its format is perhaps less important that having it
2010-12-12T09:33:38  <delt0r___> and "named" things is a good idea
2010-12-12T09:33:59  <amstan> yes, so instead of making or own format for a dict like thing
2010-12-12T09:34:01  <amstan> just use json
2010-12-12T09:34:04  <delt0r___> but is JSON the best for this.?
2010-12-12T09:34:07  <antimatroid> yeah, i think pass people board dimensions, then wait for them to send back "ready" then feed gamestates
2010-12-12T09:34:23  <antimatroid> possibly pass noTurns and turnTime as well
2010-12-12T09:34:42  <antimatroid> that way parameters can be played with and people can't bitch about having hard coded anything
2010-12-12T09:34:47  <amstan> you could even have a warning indicator
2010-12-12T09:34:53  <amstan> for running out of time
2010-12-12T09:35:05  <antimatroid> no, just provide timers in every starter package
2010-12-12T09:35:12  <antimatroid> with a  getTime function
2010-12-12T09:35:27  <amstan> antimatroid: but which parameters do we include, you cannot know you which ones you'll need by the time you have to have the protocol done
2010-12-12T09:35:32  <delt0r___> amstan: what are your thoughts on the next game (kind of game that it)
2010-12-12T09:35:33  <delt0r___> is
2010-12-12T09:35:37  <amstan> delt0r___: no idea
2010-12-12T09:35:47  <amstan> people are suggesting ants, but i don't see how that's going to work
2010-12-12T09:35:51  <amstan> in terms of processing power
2010-12-12T09:36:02  <antimatroid> amstan: works fine with single processes, like i said before
2010-12-12T09:36:13  <antimatroid> we are working out now how to do it feasibly
2010-12-12T09:36:20  <delt0r___> yea-- i almost have an game implementation ready. Buts its one process per player --not per ant
2010-12-12T09:36:26  <amstan> how?
2010-12-12T09:36:35  <amstan> how do you make sure ants don't communicate with eachother
2010-12-12T09:36:40  <delt0r___> I don't
2010-12-12T09:36:40  <amstan> if it's single process?
2010-12-12T09:36:58  <delt0r___> cyborg ants should have wireless anyway
2010-12-12T09:37:05  <antimatroid> delt0r___: i am wondering how you feel about automatic fight to the death if two enemy bots land in the same square, invalid if two friends land in the same square, and you can "fight" an enemy next to you?
2010-12-12T09:37:15  <antimatroid> that way there is no move collision detection
2010-12-12T09:37:25  <antimatroid> well, undoing moves
2010-12-12T09:37:41  <Epona> itd be cool to see friendly fire
2010-12-12T09:37:50  <delt0r___> well i have my basic version almost done... lets just see what falls out
2010-12-12T09:38:08  <delt0r___> amstan: I will give JSON a good look at in the next days
2010-12-12T09:38:48  <antimatroid> delt0r____: would i be able to take a look at the code you have so far? i could start knocking together a few example like bots if i knew what the format is like
2010-12-12T09:41:32  <delt0r___> antimatroid: its not so nice yet... let me finish a debug round or two
2010-12-12T09:41:53  <antimatroid> sure
2010-12-12T09:48:00  <delt0r___> antimatroid: its java you know
2010-12-12T09:48:11  <antimatroid> that's alright, i can probably read it

2010-12-12T10:38:52  <antimatroid> i think it might be cool if a bot can "shoot" with a given direction, and that bullet just follows that path until hitting a wall or enemy
2010-12-12T10:38:55  <antimatroid> or friend
2010-12-12T10:39:53  <delt0r___> my fighting is that an ant must "attack" an adjesnt square
2010-12-12T10:40:18  <antimatroid> that's what i was thinking before, what do you think of it being "fire" with direction??
2010-12-12T10:40:41  <antimatroid> it's not possible to shoot yourself (without looping the map) like that either
2010-12-12T10:40:44  <delt0r___> more code--right not antthing with more code
2010-12-12T10:40:55  <delt0r___> ;)
2010-12-12T10:50:32  <antimatroid> it's not much harder, and way more awesome
2010-12-12T10:50:52  <delt0r___> now you are tracking ants and "bullets"
2010-12-12T10:50:57  <delt0r___> its quite a bit more code
2010-12-12T10:52:01  <antimatroid> not really, bullets are just an extra thing per square, and they have a specified direction
2010-12-12T10:52:12  <antimatroid> if they even land in the same squer as an ant, deduct an hp
2010-12-12T10:52:19  <antimatroid> ever*

2010-12-12T10:53:10  <antimatroid> bots should cancel each other too

2010-12-12T11:12:48  <antimatroid> bhasker: morning
2010-12-12T11:12:52  <bhasker>  morning
2010-12-12T11:12:57  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/ugaRX7bA
2010-12-12T11:13:03  <antimatroid> i made an example map gen for antwars :)(
2010-12-12T11:13:10  <antimatroid> there is a map at the bottom of the page
2010-12-12T11:13:17  <antimatroid> looking for any feedback
2010-12-12T11:13:37  <bhasker> oh i haven't read about the game yet
2010-12-12T11:14:25  <bhasker> so the numbers is the amount of resources at that point?
2010-12-12T11:15:58  <antimatroid> yep
2010-12-12T11:16:03  <antimatroid> 'a' and 'b' are home holes
2010-12-12T11:16:06  <antimatroid> # are walls
2010-12-12T11:16:22  <bhasker> ah k
2010-12-12T11:16:26  <antimatroid> with edges wrapped, you can reach every non-wall from your home hole, which is where ants would spawn
2010-12-12T11:16:50  <bhasker> ah k
2010-12-12T11:18:16  <bhasker> so what kind of feedback are you looking for? critique on the map? or the generator?.
2010-12-12T11:18:23  <antimatroid> anything
2010-12-12T11:18:31  <antimatroid> suggestions for what people like/don't like
2010-12-12T11:18:40  <bhasker> hmm
2010-12-12T11:18:45  <bhasker> let me read up on the game first
2010-12-12T11:19:03  <antimatroid> the last few pages are possibly more relevant than the middle ones
2010-12-12T11:20:12  <bhasker> k
2010-12-12T11:21:35  <antimatroid> i'm going to make a post in there of how i currently think it could be done
2010-12-12T11:23:38  <bhasker> so each ant runs a copy of the code
2010-12-12T11:23:56  <bhasker> so the server will spin up new instances every time the ant reproduces?
2010-12-12T11:25:09  <antimatroid> no, we currently think all ants will be in the one process
2010-12-12T11:25:20  <antimatroid> it's too hard to do it the other way
2010-12-12T11:25:27  <antimatroid> but i think this will still be quite interesting
2010-12-12T11:27:09  <bhasker> ah the battle code competition does that
2010-12-12T11:27:10  <bhasker> i think
2010-12-12T11:27:21  <bhasker> there each robot spins up an instance
2010-12-12T11:33:28  <bhasker> overall looks interesting to me
2010-12-12T11:33:45  <bhasker> but hard to critique without some real gameplay on the map
2010-12-12T11:34:26  <antimatroid> yep
2010-12-12T11:34:38  <antimatroid> i'm about halfway through writing this more recent post

2010-12-12T11:41:19  <bhasker> or are they still being fleshed out

2010-12-12T12:00:16  <antimatroid> this is probably getting old, but...
2010-12-12T12:00:17  <antimatroid> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1205&p=8271#p8271
2010-12-12T12:00:34  <antimatroid> that is one way i'm pretty sure the game could full be implemented and work without issues
2010-12-12T12:01:51  <bhasker> 2. Each player controls all ants in the one process (so all share the same information), two friend ants cannot move into the same square (that would be an invalid order and loss of game), if two enemy ants land in the same square, the one with the lowest hp dies (could be both) and the other one loses that many hp, although ants may swap places.
2010-12-12T12:01:54  <bhasker> should be requoted
2010-12-12T12:01:59  <bhasker> rephrased rather
2010-12-12T12:02:00  <bhasker> doh
2010-12-12T12:02:11  <bhasker> "if two enemy ants land in the same square"
2010-12-12T12:02:21  <bhasker> should probably be rephrased
2010-12-12T12:03:22  <antimatroid> why?
2010-12-12T12:03:45  <bhasker> could be read as two ants owned by the enemy
2010-12-12T12:03:50  <bhasker> which makes no sense
2010-12-12T12:03:57  <antimatroid> ah yep
2010-12-12T12:04:13  <antimatroid> opposing?
2010-12-12T12:04:21  <bhasker> yes

2010-12-12T12:04:41  <bhasker> so new ants can only spawn at home bases?
2010-12-12T12:04:48  <bhasker> and ants have to carry the food back to home base?
2010-12-12T12:05:31  <antimatroid> yes
2010-12-12T12:05:39  <antimatroid> but you can deposit it to another ant
2010-12-12T12:05:46  <bhasker> ah so you can make supply chains
2010-12-12T12:05:49  <antimatroid> yep

2010-12-12T22:14:42  <bhasker> antimatroid http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-algorithms-problem-solving-ants.html
2010-12-12T22:18:21  <antimatroid1> i saw that recently actually thanks
2010-12-12T22:18:27  <antimatroid1> i just fixed up the map generator
2010-12-12T22:18:40  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/I8r5fxCx
2010-12-12T22:18:53  <antimatroid1> i took out two of the symmetries, and added in a random "translate" map function
2010-12-12T22:19:16  <antimatroid1> the two symmetries i took are are what would have always left the other home on either the same column or row as yours, even after translating
2010-12-12T22:19:23  <antimatroid1> sigh: is that better ^^?
2010-12-12T22:21:15  <sigh> ahaha, you've got a variable named map
2010-12-12T22:21:26  <antimatroid1> yeah i know, i should change that
2010-12-12T22:21:31  <antimatroid1> but it works atm
2010-12-12T22:21:38  <sigh> yeah, you are overriding a builtin method
2010-12-12T22:21:47  <antimatroid1> it's the jumbling i am interested in?
2010-12-12T22:21:58  <sigh> what jumbling?
2010-12-12T22:22:00  <antimatroid1> with the way it is now, i think their home base could be any other square
2010-12-12T22:22:23  <antimatroid1> at the end i translate everything in x and y dirrections
2010-12-12T22:22:34  <sigh> what does translating do?
2010-12-12T22:22:38  <antimatroid1> and i removed the two symmetries that had their home base on the same row or column
2010-12-12T22:22:53  <antimatroid1> picks iT and jT randomly, then shifts all squares by that amount
2010-12-12T22:23:00  <sigh> but why?
2010-12-12T22:23:08  <sigh> it doesn't change anything?
2010-12-12T22:23:18  <antimatroid1> it means you don't know where their home base is
2010-12-12T22:23:23  <antimatroid1> not even one of say 7 locations
2010-12-12T22:23:56  <antimatroid1> because you don't know how much it was translated
2010-12-12T22:24:33  <sigh> ah, I see
2010-12-12T22:24:58  <antimatroid1> if we're going to have private information, it's silly if people just send out a couple of scouts to the few possible places the other base might be
2010-12-12T22:26:10  <janzert> ? how does translation effect that though (I should probably just read the code)
2010-12-12T22:26:11  <sigh> still trivial
2010-12-12T22:26:26  <antimatroid1> janzert: so that it isn't symmetric about the centre
2010-12-12T22:26:29  <janzert> translation won't change the relative position between the two bases
2010-12-12T22:26:31  <sigh> just go in ne and sw
2010-12-12T22:26:40  <sigh> you'll find the other base
2010-12-12T22:26:44  <sigh> *ne and nw
2010-12-12T22:27:16  <antimatroid1> hmmm, is there any way to change it
2010-12-12T22:27:22  <antimatroid1> i guess not
2010-12-12T22:27:28  <sigh> not with what you have
2010-12-12T22:27:30  <antimatroid1> i'll add the other symmetries back in at least
2010-12-12T22:27:39  <sigh> haha
2010-12-12T22:28:02  <antimatroid1> what about with transpose?
2010-12-12T22:28:08  <antimatroid1> bah nevermind
2010-12-12T22:28:09  <sigh> same
2010-12-12T22:28:32  <sigh> transpose is nw
2010-12-12T22:29:01  <sigh> errr... maybe the other way around
2010-12-12T22:29:28  <antimatroid1> is it worth doing the transpose at all?
2010-12-12T22:30:23  <sigh> actually, I'm not so sure that it is trivial anymore
2010-12-12T22:30:46  <antimatroid1> with walls?
2010-12-12T22:31:21  <janzert> if you're bases could be anywhere within a quadrant (rotate 180 degrees) for opposition base/side then randomly mirror and translate at the end
2010-12-12T22:31:57  <antimatroid1> janzert: atm i'm randomly picking before 4 symemtries
2010-12-12T22:32:08  <antimatroid1> although using the one symmetry for a whole board, of course
2010-12-12T22:32:30  <antimatroid1> between*
2010-12-12T22:33:15  <antimatroid1> i think that option is the first symmetry, location 2 = [dim-loc[0]-1, dim-loc[1]-1] ?
2010-12-12T22:33:48  <sigh> well, you guys can figure out if the other base is always reachable by travelling diagonally
2010-12-12T22:34:02  <antimatroid1> sigh: the walls will prevent that
2010-12-12T22:34:03  <sigh> I suspect it is, but don't have time to investigate, atm
2010-12-12T22:34:07  <antimatroid1> but it may give you an idea of where it is
2010-12-12T22:34:09  <janzert> why do the bases always end up on the 45% angle from each other?
2010-12-12T22:34:23  <sigh> janzert: because of wrapping
2010-12-12T22:34:39  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/h4awYPiH
2010-12-12T22:34:45  <antimatroid1> they don't for that, they may end up on the same line
2010-12-12T22:35:46  <janzert> maps are always square or can be rectangular?
2010-12-12T22:35:53  <sigh> yeah, well putting those symettries back in means you have 4 directions to search instead of 2
2010-12-12T22:35:58  <sigh> janzert: square arm
2010-12-12T22:35:58  <antimatroid1> always square, i can change that if i remove the 4th symmetry
2010-12-12T22:35:59  <sigh> *atm
2010-12-12T22:36:18  <antimatroid1> although even dimensions makes my life easier
2010-12-12T22:36:31  <antimatroid1> with respect to generating correct number of walls/grain squares
2010-12-12T22:37:49  <antimatroid1> you are guaranteed that your ants can reach every non-wall square from the spawn point if edges are wrapped
2010-12-12T22:41:44  <janzert> agh, use 0 instead of '0' :}
2010-12-12T22:41:51  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-12T22:41:53  <antimatroid1> fixed
2010-12-12T22:42:43  <antimatroid1> well, now it is
2010-12-12T22:43:01  <sigh> ok, I think that rotating thwarts the diagonal thing
2010-12-12T22:43:02  <janzert> and it's probably easier to visualize if the 0 turn into . when printing
2010-12-12T22:43:38  <antimatroid1> sigh: wouldn't it just make it one diagonal direction?
2010-12-12T22:44:25  <janzert> rotating should allow them to end up, with a final mirror/translation step should allow them to end up any relative position
2010-12-12T22:45:33  <antimatroid1> do i need to rotate it once or twice? and just clockwise is fine?
2010-12-12T22:45:49  <sigh> rotate 180 then translate
2010-12-12T22:45:51  <sigh> is enough
2010-12-12T22:45:56  <antimatroid1> okay, i'll do that now
2010-12-12T22:46:18  <antimatroid1> you will probably cry of laughter at how i'd rotate something, what's the easiest way? :P
2010-12-12T22:46:26  <sigh> x,y = -x,-y
2010-12-12T22:46:51  <janzert> what you would probably want to do is generate half the map completely random then rotate 180 degrees, then translate (and randomly mirror if the bases are identifiable to the ants as a and b)
2010-12-12T22:46:59  <sigh> err... adjust for your non-zero centered grid :P
2010-12-12T22:47:06  <janzert> mirror, 50% of the time that is
2010-12-12T22:47:25  <antimatroid1> okay
2010-12-12T22:47:31  <sigh> x,y = dim-x-1, dim-y-1 is correct, I think?
2010-12-12T22:47:36  <antimatroid1> janzert: will that work with my paint algorithm each turn?
2010-12-12T22:47:42  <antimatroid1> to make sure all squares can be reached
2010-12-12T22:48:39  <antimatroid1> i'll just do it how i would, and let you laugh at me :)
2010-12-12T22:48:56  <janzert> I haven't worked out what the whole thing is doing yet :)
2010-12-12T22:49:57  <antimatroid1> janzert: 'a' and 'b' represent home holes, where an ant spawns if grains are there and no ant is currently on it, you start with 5 grains or so, # are walls, and numbers are grains that can be harvested
2010-12-12T22:50:04  <antimatroid1> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1205&start=60
2010-12-12T22:50:14  <antimatroid1> my last post there explains how i think the game could be done and work
2010-12-12T22:50:17  <janzert> yep, I figured that much out
2010-12-12T22:50:20  <antimatroid1> well, last big post
2010-12-12T22:52:01  <janzert> ok, so with the proposed protocol the player won't know which base is 'a' or 'b' so the mirror step is unnecessary
2010-12-12T22:52:08  <antimatroid1> sigh: http://codepad.org/QMhXN2O5
2010-12-12T22:52:10  <antimatroid1> will that do the trick?
2010-12-12T22:52:36  <antimatroid1> oh, iR = jR = dim-1 though
2010-12-12T22:53:07  <antimatroid1> and returning my new map ehe

2010-12-12T22:54:08  <antimatroid1> i'll work it out later, it's giving me an error now
2010-12-12T22:54:58  <sigh> I just writing a function to test that the generator doesn't always creates maps where you can trivially find the other bases by going in any of the 8 obvious directions

2010-12-12T23:09:00  <janzert> here's a bit of list and generator expression abuse for your map printing function :) http://codepad.org/Cxb32Pad
2010-12-12T23:09:55  <janzert> print_list can also just be print " ".join(str(i) for i in pList)

2010-12-12T23:11:00  <antimatroid1> oh god, that's so much better to look at :)
2010-12-12T23:11:52  <antimatroid1> i think this game could work though, and i think it'd make for a pretty awesome one
2010-12-12T23:12:47  <janzert> someone should go back and look at the tron map generator, I think it should be adaptable to make pretty good maps for this
2010-12-12T23:26:19  <sigh> janzert: " ".join(map(str,pList)) if we are going for code golf here :P
2010-12-12T23:27:32  <janzert> won't work cause map is overridden as a list of lists :P
2010-12-12T23:27:42  <janzert> but yeah
2010-12-12T23:27:54  <sigh> aha... you are right :(
2010-12-12T23:32:15  <antimatroid1> janzert: i had a good idea for tron last night actually
2010-12-12T23:32:35  <antimatroid1> like this  but without resources, you get a new snake of length x from home hole every y turns, if you go into their hole they lose
2010-12-12T23:32:45  <antimatroid1> and if a snake dies, it disappears
2010-12-12T23:33:37  <sigh> so you've got a "snake" and your aim is to invade the opponent's "hole"... right
2010-12-12T23:34:00  <antimatroid1> you have multiple snakes
2010-12-12T23:34:06  <antimatroid1> so you have to protect your hole and invade theirs
2010-12-12T23:34:10  <sigh> haha
