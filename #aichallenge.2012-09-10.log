2012-09-10T16:19:08  <mcstar> thestinger: i changed the algorithm
2012-09-10T16:19:29  <thestinger> better complexity?
2012-09-10T16:19:29  <mcstar> i changed it to a randomized one
2012-09-10T16:19:36  <mcstar> ill show you
2012-09-10T16:19:38  <mcstar> you will laugh
2012-09-10T16:21:00  <mcstar> thestinger: http://hpaste.org/74561 lines 120-130
2012-09-10T16:21:31  <thestinger> heh
2012-09-10T16:21:33  <mcstar> i dropped the list<list<Node idiosyncracy altogether
2012-09-10T16:21:45  <mcstar> now i have a linear array of 2n elements
2012-09-10T16:22:20  <thestinger> mcstar: -std=c++11 :P
2012-09-10T16:22:30  <mcstar> why?
2012-09-10T16:22:33  <mcstar> 0x is nice
2012-09-10T16:22:50  <thestinger> because they are going to remove it eventually
2012-09-10T16:23:00  <thestinger> as they are with c1x
2012-09-10T16:23:03  <mcstar> anyway, with these changes i managed to remove allocation bottleneck
2012-09-10T16:23:36  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-09-10T16:25:08  <thestinger> mcstar: the allocations still scale up by ~17-20x though
2012-09-10T16:28:23  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-10T16:28:25  <mcstar> it aleays will
2012-09-10T16:28:29  <mcstar> always*
2012-09-10T16:28:36  <thestinger> always? :P
2012-09-10T16:28:40  <mcstar> but it is now balanced with other operations
2012-09-10T16:28:56  <mcstar> thestinger: yes, since you have to have a copy of a diagram which is a small array
2012-09-10T16:29:02  <mcstar> you cant circumwent that
2012-09-10T16:29:19  <mcstar> the problem size simply increases that way
2012-09-10T16:29:25  <thestinger> do you ever modify it though?
2012-09-10T16:29:29  <thestinger> why does it have to be copied?
2012-09-10T16:29:37  <mcstar> it doesnt
2012-09-10T16:29:41  <mcstar> bad word
2012-09-10T16:29:48  <mcstar> i meant you have to store it
2012-09-10T16:30:15  <mcstar> thestinger: are you inderested in the problem, those lines solve, that i mentioned?
2012-09-10T16:30:18  <mcstar> it is interesting
2012-09-10T16:30:39  <thestinger> yes
2012-09-10T16:30:48  <thestinger> but I don't understand what it does as a whole
2012-09-10T16:31:09  <mcstar> thestinger: do you know an online drawing board?
2012-09-10T16:31:18  <thestinger> no :(
2012-09-10T16:31:18  <mcstar> other than sketcia
2012-09-10T16:33:01  <thestinger> I actually kinda like std::bind now
2012-09-10T16:33:22  <thestinger> despite it being so much more verbose than ML-style partial functions
2012-09-10T16:33:33  <thestinger> kinda neat that it can reorder params
2012-09-10T16:33:57  <mcstar> thestinger: http://sketchia.com/draw.html#lVScNWi
2012-09-10T16:34:17  <mcstar> there are 2 diagrams, up and down
2012-09-10T16:34:21  <mcstar> it doesnt really matter
2012-09-10T16:34:50  <mcstar> the task, is to re-number regions, that are on the same index, near the pink line
2012-09-10T16:35:37  <mcstar> thestinger: the numbers connected by the green lines, near the pink line, must share the same numbers
2012-09-10T16:36:09  <mcstar> is it clear?
2012-09-10T16:38:50  <thestinger> yes
2012-09-10T16:39:15  <mcstar> so, antimatroidl's task reduces to 2 problems, one is this
2012-09-10T16:39:29  <mcstar> another one, is a canonical representation of a diagram, to actually compare them
2012-09-10T16:39:39  <mcstar> anyway, lets just focus on this
2012-09-10T16:40:13  <mcstar> thestinger: so, come up with an algorithm that does the above stuff, but with minimal machinery
2012-09-10T16:40:27  <mcstar> i.e., it is already solved by using sets of sets of nodes
2012-09-10T16:40:33  <mcstar> we dont want that
2012-09-10T16:41:07  <mcstar> thestinger: just to be clear, tell me what will be the end configuration of mydrawing
2012-09-10T16:42:45  <thestinger> I don't really understand what those two sets of things represent
2012-09-10T16:43:00  <mcstar> doesnt matter
2012-09-10T16:43:15  <mcstar> all you have are 2, 2xn lattice points
2012-09-10T16:43:21  <mcstar> that are numbered
2012-09-10T16:44:05  <mcstar> if you put one below another, side-by-side numbers(and thereby regions) must be renumbered to be the same
2012-09-10T16:44:23  <mcstar> in the end we are only interested the upper and lower rows of the 4, but this is just a detail
2012-09-10T16:47:47  <mcstar> thestinger: http://i.imgur.com/j0sG2.png most of the time are not spent allocation, but in  main, where i add the diagrams to a set and a dequeue
2012-09-10T16:47:56  <mcstar> in*
2012-09-10T16:53:42  <mcstar> thestinger: so you dont want to tell me, how it'd look after the reduction?

2012-09-10T18:49:53  <antimatroidl> mcstar: shouldn't take very long for F_8
2012-09-10T18:50:08  <antimatroidl> took my friend like 5 seconds to get F_10

2012-09-10T18:51:55  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan
2012-09-10T18:52:31  <mcstar> antimatroidl: 3.11s for F_8, but you should divide it by 4 at least to compare
2012-09-10T18:52:49  <mcstar> how did he get 5 secs for F_10?
2012-09-10T18:53:04  <mcstar> that must take 400x than F_8
2012-09-10T18:53:16  <mcstar> that of*
2012-09-10T18:53:58  <mcstar> when i compared your code to mine on a diagram, yours was 4 times slowe, on my machine
2012-09-10T18:54:01  <mcstar> so i dont get it
2012-09-10T18:55:33  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i have a new method of taking the product, it is ridiculously simple, not sets and such
2012-09-10T18:55:41  <mcstar> no*
2012-09-10T19:01:54  <antimatroidl> mcstar: shoot
2012-09-10T19:01:57  <antimatroidl> although i have to go soon
2012-09-10T19:03:41  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i just run your Diagram.h with my dict/dequeu, you scored 48.4 secs
2012-09-10T19:03:54  <mcstar> mine does it in 3.1secs
2012-09-10T19:05:27  <mcstar> antimatroidl: a diagram is a linear array of 2n elements, thats how it is stored, i do my stuff on a 4xn table, renumbering groups probabilistically
2012-09-10T19:06:19  <antimatroidl> wut?
2012-09-10T19:06:19  <mcstar> until reaching a criteron, of all the matching elements of the 2nd and 3rd row must have the same numbers
2012-09-10T19:06:24  <antimatroidl> maybe explain later
2012-09-10T19:06:27  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-10T19:06:27  <antimatroidl> i need to head to uni
2012-09-10T19:06:30  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-10T19:06:38  <mcstar> antimatroidl: did your friend use your code?
2012-09-10T19:06:40  <mcstar> last question
2012-09-10T19:07:49  <mcstar> http://hpaste.org/74561

2012-09-10T19:11:48  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-10T19:12:05  <antimatroidl> he was working on computing the ideals
2012-09-10T19:12:20  <antimatroidl> which we've now completed (most of the programming for that done by him)
2012-09-10T19:12:23  <antimatroidl> anyway, ttyl
