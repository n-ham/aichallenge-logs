2012-05-08T16:49:50  <delt0r> and i have 2 great gui ideas i want someone else to code up
2012-05-08T16:50:00  <mcstar> ill do it
2012-05-08T16:50:06  <delt0r> java?
2012-05-08T16:50:09  <mcstar> no
2012-05-08T16:50:12  <delt0r> lol
2012-05-08T16:50:27  <delt0r> well i don't want to mantian builds for the platforms i need to support...
2012-05-08T16:50:32  <delt0r> maintain
2012-05-08T16:50:47  <delt0r> so java is typically what i use for this... its pretty small...
2012-05-08T16:50:53  <delt0r> I could do it
2012-05-08T16:50:56  <delt0r> but meh
2012-05-08T16:51:32  <mcstar> what is it for?
2012-05-08T16:52:31  <mcstar> also, im not sure how hard java would be
2012-05-08T16:52:37  <mcstar> what about clojure?
2012-05-08T16:53:11  <mcstar> delt0r: dont you want to share the idea?
2012-05-08T16:54:40  <delt0r> its not like that kind of idea..
2012-05-08T16:54:56  <delt0r> My simulation software uses 100% command line
2012-05-08T16:55:20  <delt0r> yet some of the folks i work with are biologist that don't know what end of a computer to plug in
2012-05-08T16:55:28  <mcstar> 'that kind of idea' what did i imply?
2012-05-08T16:55:52  <delt0r> so the idea it that you can use a gui to define population structures and stuff and it writes out the command line
2012-05-08T16:56:01  <delt0r> mcstar: like a good one...
2012-05-08T16:56:14  <delt0r> that could ya know... be good and stuff
2012-05-08T16:56:14  <mcstar> it is a good one if it makes their lives easier
2012-05-08T16:56:24  <delt0r> fusion is a good idea
2012-05-08T16:56:35  <delt0r> I have a idea for fusion
2012-05-08T16:56:39  <mcstar> loop fusion? or haskell like fusion?
2012-05-08T16:56:54  <mcstar> (or the real one, but thats overrated)
2012-05-08T16:56:57  <delt0r> like nuclear fusion
2012-05-08T16:57:08  <mcstar> dream on
2012-05-08T16:57:34  <mcstar> ah, your idea is porbably to channel all that money into biology
2012-05-08T16:57:36  <mcstar> right?
2012-05-08T16:57:39  <delt0r> oh i will... and as a ex physicist its not a dream... it will happen sooner or later
2012-05-08T16:58:01  <delt0r> nope... we should fund it seriously... not politically like now
2012-05-08T16:58:04  <mcstar> delt0r: im more interested in cold fusion
2012-05-08T16:58:20  <mcstar> fascinating problem
2012-05-08T16:58:27  <delt0r> now that is a real dream on i am afraid.

2012-05-08T16:59:10  <mcstar> there is theoretical evindence that in deuterium phonons can lower the energy barrier for fusion
2012-05-08T16:59:15  <delt0r> even if every claim they said is true... which it can't be. Its still so little energy that its only going to help you keep your coffee just a little bit hotter

2012-05-08T16:59:19  <mcstar> 2 repsected guys from my uni calculated this
2012-05-08T16:59:47  *** thestinger is now known as Guest15460
2012-05-08T16:59:54  <delt0r> and 100 other respected guys pointed out that its not even within an order of magnitude to enough
2012-05-08T17:00:03  <delt0r> me being one of them...
2012-05-08T17:00:15  <mcstar> delt0r: the whole controversy is fascinating though
2012-05-08T17:00:28  <mcstar> much better than superlumnal neutrinos
2012-05-08T17:00:37  <delt0r> There are too many ducks that have to line up for even one of these claims. And that is *after* 20 years of data collection
2012-05-08T17:00:52  <delt0r> for example the idea that e+p->n
2012-05-08T17:01:01  *** Guest15460 is now known as thestinger
2012-05-08T17:01:22  <delt0r> fine if you find the keV of energy required --lets pretend that its there...
2012-05-08T17:01:37  <delt0r> well why don't we see n+Pd reactions etc?
2012-05-08T17:02:00  <delt0r> Oh because there is another 10 different new effects that come into play...
2012-05-08T17:02:18  <delt0r> but not in *any* other system with similar parameters...
2012-05-08T17:02:35  <delt0r> Sorry, cold fusion (LENR) is not going to fly...
2012-05-08T17:02:53  <mcstar> i dont mind
2012-05-08T17:03:07  <delt0r> fusion will....
2012-05-08T17:03:08  <delt0r> but
2012-05-08T17:03:30  <delt0r> I may turn out to not be cheap enough... I think with enough work it will be however.
2012-05-08T17:03:41  <delt0r> It may^
2012-05-08T17:04:54  <mcstar> so how would you go about doing fusion?
2012-05-08T17:05:12  <delt0r> as in Fund it? or my idea in particular?
2012-05-08T17:05:14  <mcstar> do you have a new idea for magnetic confinement?
2012-05-08T17:05:19  <mcstar> 2nd
2012-05-08T17:05:20  <delt0r> not really...
2012-05-08T17:05:35  <delt0r> well i would go the pulsed Z pinch route.
2012-05-08T17:05:56  <delt0r> but i would fix the problems by adding intense external heating
2012-05-08T17:06:14  *** foRei <foRei!~ViT@0x4dd7b24d.adsl.cybercity.dk> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye)
2012-05-08T17:06:17  <delt0r> either with a ebeam or proton beam or laser or whatever
2012-05-08T17:06:37  <delt0r> then you can decouple current/temp/pressure ballance a bit
2012-05-08T17:06:44  <delt0r> balance
2012-05-08T17:06:50  <mcstar> whats the problem with z pinch?
2012-05-08T17:06:55  <mcstar> (im not up to date)
2012-05-08T17:07:02  <delt0r> stability
2012-05-08T17:07:06  *** kurnevsky <kurnevsky!~kurnevsky@217.21.41.207> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2012-05-08T17:07:21  <delt0r> throw current at it faster or more... it just goes unstable faster
2012-05-08T17:07:23  <mcstar> is it supposed to provide sustained fusion?
2012-05-08T17:07:28  <mcstar> or just the ignition?
2012-05-08T17:07:40  <delt0r> well Q>1
2012-05-08T17:08:07  <delt0r> that is more fusion energy per pulse that energy put in
2012-05-08T17:08:18  <delt0r> ignition is overrated
2012-05-08T17:09:57  <mcstar> so if it is pulsed, how does stability come into play?
2012-05-08T17:10:13  <mcstar> does it take too long to form another pulse?
2012-05-08T17:10:17  <delt0r> well instability is measured in ns
2012-05-08T17:10:18  <mcstar> or burn
2012-05-08T17:11:14  <mcstar> i think im in the dark
2012-05-08T17:11:14  <delt0r> point in fact tokmaks are a looped stabilized z pinch
2012-05-08T17:11:19  <mcstar> will need to read up on this
2012-05-08T17:11:26  <delt0r> well its about time scales...
2012-05-08T17:12:11  <mcstar> so why would you still befer z-pinch?
2012-05-08T17:12:15  <mcstar> prefer*
2012-05-08T17:12:37  <delt0r> because i think my idea is better that other ones ;)
2012-05-08T17:12:49  <mcstar> but this isnt your idea
2012-05-08T17:13:04  <mcstar> i dont see it referred to as Deltor's pinch
2012-05-08T17:13:24  <delt0r> exteranl heated zpinch is
2012-05-08T17:13:29  <mcstar> ah yeah
2012-05-08T17:13:41  <mcstar> why would you heat it?
2012-05-08T17:14:00  *** choas <choas!~lars@p5795CDDF.dip.t-dialin.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2012-05-08T17:14:04  <mcstar> can you preheat it close the ignition temperature?(i dont think so)
2012-05-08T17:15:20  <delt0r> so you can get parts of the parameter space you couldn't otherwise
2012-05-08T17:15:22  <mcstar> delt0r: http://imgur.com/qHwwu http://imgur.com/1zC1T im doing this kind of stuff
2012-05-08T17:15:47  <mcstar> but can you still come up with a positive energy balance?
2012-05-08T17:15:51  <delt0r> for example making it hotter means more current ... but more current means many other things too
2012-05-08T17:16:21  <delt0r> Image not found
2012-05-08T17:16:49  <delt0r> quantum?

2012-05-08T17:16:57  <mcstar> try these
2012-05-08T17:17:03  <mcstar> but it shouldbe ok i think
2012-05-08T17:17:11  <delt0r> others work...
2012-05-08T17:17:21  <mcstar> not quantum
2012-05-08T17:17:31  <mcstar> simple density functionl, but classical
2012-05-08T17:17:40  <mcstar> solidifcation theory
2012-05-08T17:17:47  <delt0r> looks like crystal structure
2012-05-08T17:17:51  <mcstar> yeah
2012-05-08T17:17:52  <delt0r> right
2012-05-08T17:17:58  <mcstar> but on long long time scales
2012-05-08T17:18:08  <mcstar> and it isnt an electronic structure
2012-05-08T17:18:19  <mcstar> just atomic probabiliyt density distribution
2012-05-08T17:18:30  <delt0r> right
2012-05-08T17:18:36  <delt0r> geology?
2012-05-08T17:18:54  <mcstar> no
2012-05-08T17:19:02  <delt0r> long time scales
2012-05-08T17:19:05  <a1k0n> statistical physics?
2012-05-08T17:19:10  <mcstar> yeah
2012-05-08T17:19:21  <mcstar> long means not MD time scales, but diffusional
2012-05-08T17:19:34  <mcstar> like 10^-9 secs
2012-05-08T17:19:42  <mcstar> to 10^-6
2012-05-08T17:19:47  <mcstar> i think
2012-05-08T17:20:04  <delt0r> right... but that is not so long compared to time to solidify
2012-05-08T17:20:46  <mcstar> well, stuff can solidify really slowly, with low driving force
2012-05-08T17:20:51  <mcstar> and it really depends on many things
2012-05-08T17:21:00  <mcstar> liquid-solid, vapor-solid
2012-05-08T17:21:15  <delt0r> right
2012-05-08T17:21:42  <mcstar> this model seems to capture feature of crystallizing collodial system

2012-05-08T18:22:46  <delt0r> did quite a bit of astrophysics... try to keep up with paper too
2012-05-08T18:23:06  <mcstar> do those guys do n-body simulations?
2012-05-08T18:23:12  <delt0r> yes...
2012-05-08T18:23:28  <mcstar> are you familiar with the fast multipole method?
2012-05-08T18:23:31  <delt0r> were each particle can be the size of a galaxy
2012-05-08T18:23:37  <delt0r> no
2012-05-08T18:23:51  <delt0r> fast multipole... sounds like fun...
2012-05-08T18:24:20  <mcstar> it is lumping bodies together, and computing effective forces on other bodies
2012-05-08T18:24:21  <delt0r> SPH is pretty common for this sort of thing.. good with large variation of scales
2012-05-08T18:24:44  <delt0r> well there are a lot of approximations of course.
2012-05-08T18:24:53  <mcstar> i was just wondering about the accuracy of the simulations
2012-05-08T18:25:05  <mcstar> but i think im going in the wrong direction
2012-05-08T18:25:11  <delt0r> depends who you ask... i would say "accurate enough"
2012-05-08T18:25:47  <delt0r> they are pretty good at showing the local lumpy ness of the univierse and early universe needs something like dark matter
2012-05-08T18:26:23  <mcstar> i didnt know that
2012-05-08T18:26:28  <delt0r> mcstar: typically the only long range force is gravity, which can be done well with PIC
2012-05-08T18:26:43  <mcstar> whats that?
2012-05-08T18:26:54  <delt0r> Particle in a cell
2012-05-08T18:27:28  <delt0r> you calculate the potential field at the cell corners for all the particles in that cell
2012-05-08T18:27:39  <delt0r> good for emag stuff too
2012-05-08T18:28:36  <delt0r> anyway... off to bed
2012-05-08T18:28:44  <mcstar> this is to avoid O(n^2) force calculations?
2012-05-08T18:28:48  <delt0r> yes
2012-05-08T18:28:53  <mcstar> i see
2012-05-08T18:28:58  <mcstar> good night, im going too
