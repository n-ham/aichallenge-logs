2011-09-22T00:20:19  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold current games, maps and uploads are copied to new server. we can use rsync to copy any new ones over as well
2011-09-22T00:20:19  <contestbot> janzert: Yes master!
2011-09-22T00:37:00  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-22T00:37:44  <McLeopold> amstan: can we get an A record for beta.ai-contest.com?
2011-09-22T00:37:57  <amstan> McLeopold: i don't have dns access
2011-09-22T00:38:17  <McLeopold> can you text jeff for dns access?
2011-09-22T00:38:41  <amstan> i think an email would work better, last time i din't get a reply
2011-09-22T00:38:56  <amstan> what i could do is redirect aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com
2011-09-22T00:39:17  <janzert> don't do that yet :}
2011-09-22T00:39:20  <McLeopold> no, we can all create new names
2011-09-22T00:39:34  <janzert> but I think we should once everything is moved over
2011-09-22T00:39:35  <McLeopold> I want to launch, and that means official dns records
2011-09-22T00:39:46  <janzert> yes, eventually
2011-09-22T00:39:57  <McLeopold> eventually as in within 48 hours
2011-09-22T00:40:10  <janzert> you want to launch in 48 hours?
2011-09-22T00:40:15  <McLeopold> beta, yes

2011-09-22T00:40:38  <McLeopold> or at least get the server running with the right dns record
2011-09-22T00:40:55  <janzert> we can do final beta without changing dns
2011-09-22T00:41:11  <McLeopold> ai-contest.com?
2011-09-22T00:42:13  <janzert> what we do need to find out from jeff is that money is available
2011-09-22T00:42:15  <McLeopold> we had talked about a pw.ai-contest.com as well, so people can still look at the old site
2011-09-22T00:43:08  <janzert> after all my finagling today I'm rather convinced the main server shouldn't be a spot instance, which is fine but raises the cost to more than I'm willing to spend on the contest :/
2011-09-22T00:44:29  <janzert> McLeopold: can you move the database...err...data over?
2011-09-22T00:44:50  <janzert> I think everything else is setup
2011-09-22T00:45:25  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-22T00:45:47  <janzert> I can shut down the current workers whenever you want to stop games being processed
2011-09-22T00:46:07  <McLeopold> yeah, shut them down now
2011-09-22T00:46:18  <janzert> and I suppose we should shut off submissions as well
2011-09-22T00:47:53  <janzert> hmm, out of curiosity does turning off submissions stop new user account creation?
2011-09-22T00:49:14  <janzert> workers are down
2011-09-22T00:49:35  <McLeopold> ok, give me 5 min
2011-09-22T00:52:34  <janzert> amstan: want the same username and ssh key from the current beta server setup?
2011-09-22T00:52:50  <amstan> sure
2011-09-22T00:53:12  <amstan> what about the pass? i still need it for root
2011-09-22T00:53:43  <janzert> I'm setting up all accounts iwth a disabled password and just ssh access
2011-09-22T00:53:50  <amstan> ok
2011-09-22T00:54:50  <McLeopold> we need to get jeff back on IRC for the next 2 weeks
2011-09-22T00:54:59  <McLeopold> then he can go awol again
2011-09-22T00:56:39  <janzert> amstan: your account should be setup
2011-09-22T00:57:20  <amstan> janzert: what was the hostname?
2011-09-22T00:57:23  <McLeopold> okay, data is moved, but do we run workers on both systems?
2011-09-22T00:57:30  <janzert> antsbeta.janzert.com
2011-09-22T00:57:41  <McLeopold> it seems like we should stick with one
2011-09-22T00:57:51  <janzert> I'll switch the workers to run against the new one
2011-09-22T00:57:57  <amstan> janzert: i get permission denied
2011-09-22T00:58:00  <McLeopold> so, do we point everyone there?
2011-09-22T00:58:10  <janzert> hmm, username alex right?
2011-09-22T00:58:14  <amstan> janzert: ya
2011-09-22T00:58:37  <janzert> McLeopold: I'd rather just change the aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com dns once we're setup there
2011-09-22T00:58:52  <janzert> amstan: just sec, know the problem
2011-09-22T00:58:57  <McLeopold> 128.6 games in the last 5 minutes, wow
2011-09-22T00:59:06  <amstan> McLeopold: much better compared to 20
2011-09-22T00:59:14  <McLeopold> that can't be right
2011-09-22T00:59:21  <janzert> amstan: try now
2011-09-22T00:59:29  <amstan> yay
2011-09-22T00:59:46  <amstan> what's with the funky hostname?
2011-09-22T00:59:50  <janzert> wrong ownership of .ssh directory
2011-09-22T01:00:04  <janzert> it's the ec2 internal name
2011-09-22T01:00:44  <amstan> janzert: so how do i sudo? won't i need a pass for that?
2011-09-22T01:00:59  <janzert> rsync'ed last games and entries over
2011-09-22T01:01:05  <janzert> nope
2011-09-22T01:01:23  <janzert> you shouldn't have on the other beta server either
2011-09-22T01:01:24  <amstan> janzert: well, it asks for one
2011-09-22T01:01:27  <janzert> at least I didn't
2011-09-22T01:01:36  <janzert> ahh, oops forgot to add you to admin group
2011-09-22T01:01:51  <janzert> might need to relog for it to take effect
2011-09-22T01:02:14  <amstan> janzert: ok, cool
2011-09-22T01:02:22  <amstan> janzert: can we get the awesome bashrc for the contest user?
2011-09-22T01:02:37  <janzert> think I already got the imporant bits
2011-09-22T01:02:49  <janzert> if I missed something feel free to add it
2011-09-22T01:02:50  <amstan> oh yeah, good stuff
2011-09-22T01:02:53  <McLeopold> read the problem description page carefully...
2011-09-22T01:02:58  <amstan> though, coloured prompt is always nice
2011-09-22T01:03:25  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm any ideas?
2011-09-22T01:03:30  <janzert> mleise: you around?
2011-09-22T01:03:31  <amstan> contestbot: seen CIA-24
2011-09-22T01:03:31  <contestbot> amstan: CIA-24 was last seen in #aichallenge 4 hours, 5 minutes, and 42 seconds ago: <CIA-24> aichallenge: janzert epsilon * r2e7219d / worker/sandbox.py : Try harder and check better that the sandbox processes have died before leaving kill method - http://git.io/yU5AbA
2011-09-22T01:04:36  <McLeopold> I need a pass to sudo
2011-09-22T01:04:42  <amstan> McLeopold: hold on
2011-09-22T01:05:06  <janzert> heh, did I forget everyone's admin group :}
2011-09-22T01:05:10  <amstan> McLeopold: relogin
2011-09-22T01:06:25  <McLeopold> hold off on the website/setup.py for a few days
2011-09-22T01:06:40  <amstan> janzert: what about the sudo pass then? won't it be less secure than usual if there's no pass?
2011-09-22T01:06:48  <McLeopold> okay, I'm signing off for the night, any last requests?
2011-09-22T01:06:49  <amstan> (ignoring what i did with aichallengebeta)
2011-09-22T01:07:58  <janzert> it's sort of a trade off, there's no password on the system to attack, someone has to get ahold of an ssh key instead

2011-09-22T01:09:35  <janzert> ok, anything else you can think of that I missed setting up or bringing over?
2011-09-22T01:10:09  <McLeopold> not until it breaks :)
2011-09-22T01:10:20  <janzert> so long as everything appears good tomorrow we should probably let demerzel know he can have his server back
2011-09-22T01:10:32  <McLeopold> this server is much faster
2011-09-22T01:11:03  <janzert> and as soon as I see that the workers appear to be working I think you can switch the dns over if you like amstan
2011-09-22T01:12:07  <amstan> janzert: can we leave it for tomorrow? i want to go to bed soon, and i don't want to leave immediatelly after i do that
2011-09-22T01:12:29  <janzert> woot, we had just passed 200000 games on demerzel's server

2011-09-22T12:27:31  <janzert> since it's just you and one other and we're in beta I don't think it's a problem just that you need to update your bot so it doesn't have an error

2011-09-22T13:09:12  <McLeopold1> janzert: GreenTea's games look okay
2011-09-22T13:09:25  <McLeopold1> the mu drops to 60 fairly quickly
2011-09-22T13:09:43  <janzert> ok
2011-09-22T13:10:16  <McLeopold1> once he get's paired with someone at 65 or so, which is very likely, the match quality drops and we start pulling in someone that matches them both
2011-09-22T13:10:58  <McLeopold1> the deal is, even though he is the seed, the other players will also be put at the back of the line, so I have to match well against everyone in the game, not just the seed
2011-09-22T13:11:15  * janzert nods
2011-09-22T13:12:12  <janzert> I suppose pretty unavoidably the people at either end of the rankings will get a worse average match quality
2011-09-22T13:12:17  <McLeopold1> did you get map turn limit automatted yet?
2011-09-22T13:12:37  <janzert> running automatically, no
2011-09-22T13:12:52  <janzert> it'll just be a cron entry though
2011-09-22T13:13:05  <janzert> I'm still running it manually more than once a day right now ;)
2011-09-22T13:13:53  <janzert> none of the maps have topped out yet so I'm still not sure the current metric will really work out
2011-09-22T13:14:15  <McLeopold1> are they just increasing?
2011-09-22T13:14:32  <McLeopold1> 500 looked like a good limit...
2011-09-22T13:14:55  <janzert> so far every chance they get (i.e every time a map has hit 100 games at the current limit)
2011-09-22T13:15:09  <McLeopold1> maybe it was more like, 500 if the game ends, otherwise it goes for ever, and it might have been 50% / 50%
2011-09-22T13:15:54  <janzert> there's a few maps now with lower average game lengths but they haven't hit the 100 game mark yet
2011-09-22T13:16:15  <McLeopold1> how's my map distribution?
2011-09-22T13:16:18  <janzert> I'll try and make a script to spit out histograms soon
2011-09-22T13:16:30  <McLeopold1> I haven't tried to fix it yet
2011-09-22T13:16:38  <janzert> I haven't looked at it since earlier in the week
2011-09-22T13:16:53  <McLeopold1> I should probably put a time limit on it...
2011-09-22T13:17:01  <McLeopold1> even out the maps for the last 72 or something
2011-09-22T13:17:26  <janzert> yeah, especially if we're going to add a new batch every 24 hours

2011-09-22T13:21:01  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: so, did you need to fix anything in the map generator?  because you have a week to finalize...
2011-09-22T13:21:19  <antimatroid> McLeopold1: how are you using it?
2011-09-22T13:21:35  <antimatroid> are you still asking or for say a transationally symmetric map with n players?
2011-09-22T13:21:52  <antimatroid> that was the one major thing that was horrible to use
2011-09-22T13:22:21  <McLeopold1> what?
2011-09-22T13:22:41  <antimatroid> those maps i have that allow 5 player symmetric maps etc.
2011-09-22T13:22:53  <antimatroid> it's hard to be told how many players you want for such a map
2011-09-22T13:22:55  <McLeopold1> where it is just tiled?
2011-09-22T13:22:59  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-09-22T13:23:31  <McLeopold1> of course, we want everything we can get
2011-09-22T13:23:42  <antimatroid> if you have it set up to ping it a few times with a few different number of players it'll eventually spit something out
2011-09-22T13:23:43  <McLeopold1> but, we need to start producing good maps with more than one starting ant
2011-09-22T13:23:48  <antimatroid> but it had trouble with some numbers of players
2011-09-22T13:23:52  <antimatroid> i think 5 and 7 from memory
2011-09-22T13:24:01  <McLeopold1> was it random walk?
2011-09-22T13:24:01  <antimatroid> more than one starting ant?
2011-09-22T13:24:11  <antimatroid> it doesn't do that, but shouldn't be that hard to make it do it
2011-09-22T13:24:43  <antimatroid> it uses recursive backtracking to make a maze in a generating set of the symmetry of the maze
2011-09-22T13:24:49  <McLeopold1> idealy so that each starting spot is surrounded by a different set of enemy bots
2011-09-22T13:25:19  <antimatroid> then randomly removes some more blocks to open the map up a bit and then randomly removes single water cells from the edge of the map to make the walls not straight lines
2011-09-22T13:25:26  <McLeopold1> I guess I need to review the map makers...
2011-09-22T13:25:56  <McLeopold1> what about the symmetric maps that we use now?  we've still got one for that, right?
2011-09-22T13:26:43  <antimatroid> i haven't taken map generators off github
2011-09-22T13:26:49  <McLeopold1> ok
2011-09-22T13:26:51  <antimatroid> the maze generator is the mapgen.py one
2011-09-22T13:27:08  <antimatroid> and is set up to let you use parameters etc.
2011-09-22T13:28:29  <antimatroid> i think you'd be best off just working out what proportion of tiled/translational/tessellation maps you want with a minimum and maximum number of players rather than specific numbers of players
2011-09-22T13:28:47  <antimatroid> that is tiled == translational == tessellation

2011-09-22T14:23:55  <janzert> it looks like the deprecations are telling you to use the same method instead?

2011-09-22T14:51:37  <janzert> mleise: yep
2011-09-22T14:51:43  <mleise> very cool
2011-09-22T14:51:47  <olexs> nice. good to see progress, after a long time of waiting :)
2011-09-22T14:51:50  <janzert> I'm not positive how to reactivate the submissions
2011-09-22T14:52:11  <janzert> I think the status just has to be reset, but I'm not sure
2011-09-22T14:52:20  <mleise> I guess by resetting some flag in the submissions list?
2011-09-22T14:52:33  <janzert> I'll give it a try after the workers come back up
2011-09-22T14:53:04  <mleise> ok, I'm off
2011-09-22T14:53:42  <janzert> heh, just noticed you're user_id 1

2011-09-22T15:48:02  <McLeopold1> maybe I should lower it so 80% are within 30?
2011-09-22T15:48:03  <janzert> it was a straight pareto distribution excluding only the last 50 opponents
2011-09-22T15:48:43  <janzert> I was thinking it should probably be lower yeah, but 30 might be a little too tight
2011-09-22T15:48:56  <janzert> 80% within 80 right now?
2011-09-22T15:49:08  <McLeopold1> within 50, but that is for 2 players

2011-09-22T15:51:04  <McLeopold1> I'm going to tighten up the range, just to see
2011-09-22T15:51:44  <janzert> 80% in 20 is probably even ok

2011-09-22T15:53:43  <McLeopold1> 8? that is small
2011-09-22T15:54:48  <McLeopold1> I did my alpha at 0.7, to try and hit 1 in a 1000 uses the full range
2011-09-22T15:54:56  <McLeopold1> 0.75 was about 3 in 1000
2011-09-22T15:54:56  <janzert> I don't remember exactly how it was implemented so it might have been two tailed when ever in the middle of the rankings making it 16
2011-09-22T15:55:28  <McLeopold1> so, 80% within 16?
2011-09-22T15:56:50  <McLeopold1> xathis: your last match included GreenTea
2011-09-22T15:56:55  <janzert> possibly :), I'm just looking at the spreadsheet I used to pick alpha and don't remember if the implementation would have made this a two tailed distribution or not
2011-09-22T15:56:57  <McLeopold1> the one before that had a rank 3

2011-09-22T15:57:58  <janzert> no, they didn't come back up. looking at it now
2011-09-22T15:58:02  <xathis> McLeopold1: yeah but the last one was before you changed anything.
2011-09-22T15:58:31  <xathis> McLeopold1: but the 13 games before the last one were without another top 10 bot
2011-09-22T15:58:31  <McLeopold1> and it included #1

2011-09-22T16:00:56  <janzert> remembering that we had a problem with planetwars where the top bots played each other too frequently and turned out not to be so good against the rest of the field in some cases
2011-09-22T16:01:33  <xathis> with the old matching i think there was hardly any game without another top 10 bot and i liked that
2011-09-22T16:02:26  <McLeopold1> maybe 50% within 10?
2011-09-22T16:03:09  <janzert> I don't think I'd want it any more frequent
2011-09-22T16:03:47  <janzert> although it's something I could be easily convinced otherwise ;)
2011-09-22T16:06:07  <McLeopold1> he got alot around the 15-35 range
2011-09-22T16:06:19  <janzert> McLeopold1: did you see my question about the food cutoff above?
2011-09-22T16:06:27  <McLeopold1> yeah, no idea
2011-09-22T16:06:41  <McLeopold1> they all looked like starter bots, so it might be easy to reproduce
2011-09-22T16:07:00  <janzert> also to re-enable a submission that was disabled because it didn't compile for a game, do I just set the status back to 40?
2011-09-22T16:07:08  <janzert> ok
2011-09-22T16:07:16  <McLeopold1> yes
2011-09-22T16:12:21  <janzert> hmm, no idea why the workers didn't come up properly. they seem to be working fine when I ran the setup manually

2011-09-22T16:19:18  <olexs> there are currently two workers used in the beta. I hope the started challenge will use more / more powerful ones? It will obviously need a higher game rate than the beta.
2011-09-22T16:20:12  <McLeopold1> olexs: the workers are the exact machine we'd use for the official and finals
2011-09-22T16:20:19  <McLeopold1> the number of workers depends on money
2011-09-22T16:20:38  <mcstar> but time is money
2011-09-22T16:20:42  <mcstar> this is a loop
2011-09-22T16:20:45  <olexs> how much do they cost to run?
2011-09-22T16:21:03  <McLeopold1> 20 cents an hour?
2011-09-22T16:21:39  <mcstar> McLeopold1: where are those ideas standing regarding advertising?
2011-09-22T16:21:44  <olexs> so ~300$ per worker for the 2 months
2011-09-22T16:22:01  <McLeopold1> about
2011-09-22T16:22:31  <mcstar> are you keeping the google in the name at all?

2011-09-22T16:23:08  <delt0r> google is pretty fast to claim illegal clicks and cut you off

2011-09-22T16:29:30  <mcstar> but you could accept paypal donations
2011-09-22T16:29:38  <mcstar> how about putting it on the main site?

2011-09-22T16:29:50  <McLeopold1> a donation link wouldn't be too bad
2011-09-22T16:29:54  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-22T16:30:11  <delt0r> once you take money... you need to think of taxes and company registration
2011-09-22T16:30:17  <delt0r> at least in most countries
2011-09-22T16:30:29  <mcstar> its not-for-profit
2011-09-22T16:30:43  <delt0r> you need to register and qualify for that

2011-09-22T16:31:36  <delt0r> It not a huge deal... but it more or less mean you need a "official" legal standing
2011-09-22T16:31:45  <delt0r> somewhere... it can just be a club etc
2011-09-22T16:32:10  <cody__> create a stock market bot..

2011-09-22T16:32:43  <mcstar> if i put my paypal account up on a site and say: if you pant to donate then do, in some countries that would be illegal?
2011-09-22T16:32:52  <mcstar> does it depend on where the site is hosted?
2011-09-22T16:32:56  <mcstar> its very grey to me
2011-09-22T16:33:19  <mcstar> pant->want
2011-09-22T16:34:08  <McLeopold1> not illegal, just counts as income
2011-09-22T16:34:42  <delt0r> yep.. and then you pay income tax
2011-09-22T16:34:51  <delt0r> again not a biggie
2011-09-22T16:34:58  <delt0r> but something to consider
2011-09-22T16:35:35  <delt0r> also others can't claim it as a donation to a Charity or non profit or whatever

2011-09-22T16:59:55  <delt0r> which was my point
2011-09-22T17:00:40  <delt0r> technically even with few workers the final outcome just takes longer...
2011-09-22T17:01:26  <delt0r> but while folks are tweaking their bots and what instant feedback on how well it worked. As many as possible ends up being the answer
2011-09-22T17:03:33  <cody__> current game reate is 10.1 players per minute... right

2011-09-22T17:04:04  <olexs> btw, I'm not sure that display is very correct
2011-09-22T17:04:47  <olexs> I've often waited for my next game watching that info, and it always took a lot longer than the displayed ETA.
2011-09-22T17:06:38  <McLeopold1> yeah, it is flawed
2011-09-22T17:06:42  <McLeopold1> because we don't really know
2011-09-22T17:07:22  <mcstar> McLeopold1: than how about, after launch, you help someone make a good tcp server?
2011-09-22T17:07:35  <mcstar> (im not asking you to do it, just asking about the possibility)
2011-09-22T17:07:36  <McLeopold1> geeze, I'm busy enough
2011-09-22T17:07:40  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-22T17:07:56  <McLeopold1> I'll host a tcp server, but I'm not going to make one
2011-09-22T17:08:25  <delt0r> I want to do it
2011-09-22T17:08:26  <mcstar> than delt0r might save the day
2011-09-22T17:08:31  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-22T17:08:38  <olexs> I've heard a few times in this channel about there being some code for such a server already, but never any details
2011-09-22T17:08:41  <delt0r> but its a matter of finding the time
2011-09-22T17:09:03  <delt0r> and on the odd occasion... the soberness. :D
2011-09-22T17:09:39  <delt0r> My engine is more or less finished... that i would tie into my own server frame work
2011-09-22T17:09:56  <delt0r> the question is --how to interact with the http server
2011-09-22T17:10:06  <delt0r> via a DB
2011-09-22T17:10:12  <delt0r> or via something else
2011-09-22T17:10:16  <mcstar> im not sure than wheather we should give delt0r free beer
2011-09-22T17:10:29  <delt0r> oh i have free beer
2011-09-22T17:10:44  <olexs> why not use the same engine the challenge uses, and just redirect the in/out streams through a tcp connection using a connection manager tool?
2011-09-22T17:10:48  <delt0r> I am going to be at oktoberfest on wenday too
2011-09-22T17:10:53  <mcstar> than lets take it away from you so you will find that elusive soberness
2011-09-22T17:10:55  <delt0r> wensday
2011-09-22T17:10:55  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-22T17:11:07  <delt0r> olexs: that is less fun
2011-09-22T17:11:20  <olexs> delt0r: i see :)
2011-09-22T17:11:33  <delt0r> seriously... I wrote my own ECC stuff for my game...
2011-09-22T17:11:36  <delt0r> because it was fun
2011-09-22T17:11:54  <delt0r> but yea... still however does not change much
2011-09-22T17:12:10  <delt0r> its been many days... but not a lot of time.
2011-09-22T17:12:24  <delt0r> I just don't get to do much outside work atm
2011-09-22T17:12:25  <mcstar> still dont know what ecc is
2011-09-22T17:12:33  <mcstar> other than error correction
2011-09-22T17:12:40  <delt0r> ecliptic Curve Cryptography
2011-09-22T17:12:45  <mcstar> ah
2011-09-22T17:12:50  <mcstar> i remember you told me that
2011-09-22T17:13:05  <delt0r> did LDPC codes too
2011-09-22T17:13:15  <mcstar> you mean LAPD?
2011-09-22T17:13:20  <mcstar> haha
2011-09-22T17:14:07  <delt0r> that is where Bayesian learning prorogation was first applied... aka now used in true skill
2011-09-22T17:14:29  <delt0r> Low Density Parity Codes
2011-09-22T17:14:29  <mcstar> your keyboard is seriously dislexic
2011-09-22T17:14:34  <delt0r> that me
2011-09-22T17:14:38  <delt0r> that is me
2011-09-22T17:14:40  <delt0r> hehe
2011-09-22T17:14:55  <delt0r> its a german keyboard with a US layout
2011-09-22T17:15:11  <mcstar> made in germany?
2011-09-22T17:15:11  <delt0r> which is different from both a german keyboard and a US one
2011-09-22T17:15:23  <delt0r> probably
2011-09-22T17:15:35  <delt0r> in Austria ... no one makes anything for Austria
2011-09-22T17:15:40  <mcstar> ah, it was made during ww2, so the germans only had bad photographs of the us layout, i see
2011-09-22T17:15:51  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-22T17:16:30  <delt0r> anyway... I have a bunch of 6+hour train rides coming up next week.. i hope to do some "turn key" tcp server
2011-09-22T17:16:57  <mcstar> you code on the ride?
2011-09-22T17:17:23  <delt0r> yea
2011-09-22T17:17:29  <delt0r> trains here are really nice
2011-09-22T17:17:37  <delt0r> most of my trains are the ICE
2011-09-22T17:17:47  <delt0r> they have power points etc
2011-09-22T17:17:58  <mcstar> lol
2011-09-22T17:18:03  <mcstar> microsoft?
2011-09-22T17:18:07  <delt0r> so yea can code... or what movies or whatever the whole way
2011-09-22T17:18:09  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-22T17:18:20  <delt0r> in NZ that is what we call a power socket
2011-09-22T17:19:08  <delt0r> anyway there is something i have always wanted to try... with regard to the tcp server
2011-09-22T17:19:11  <mcstar> id call it power outlet
2011-09-22T17:19:15  <mcstar> is that correct?
2011-09-22T17:19:25  <delt0r> I understand --that is enough
2011-09-22T17:19:46  <mcstar> lol, i remember when we went to swtzerland
2011-09-22T17:19:54  <mcstar> they have a socket that no other country has
2011-09-22T17:20:04  <mcstar> we werent prepared
2011-09-22T17:20:23  <mcstar> we had us plugs, but not swiss
2011-09-22T17:20:35  <mcstar> the last day of conference i could charge my powerbook
2011-09-22T17:20:37  <delt0r> it is almost the same as the rest of Europe ... but rather than 5mm pins, they use 4mm
2011-09-22T17:20:54  <mcstar> they have a central 3rd pin afaik
2011-09-22T17:21:02  <delt0r> not needed
2011-09-22T17:21:16  <mcstar> well, nevertheless we couldnt plug in ours
2011-09-22T17:21:23  <mcstar> i dont remember exactly the shape
2011-09-22T17:21:29  <delt0r> Swiss plugs work in the rest of Europe
2011-09-22T17:21:34  <delt0r> not the other way round
2011-09-22T17:22:06  <mcstar> anyway, last day i discovered that the cable that run to the TV in the hotel room, had an end, that resembled an "8"
2011-09-22T17:22:26  <mcstar> that i could plug in the apples adapter if i pulled out the pins

2011-09-22T17:33:23  <delt0r> I am thinking that because html etc is white space agnostic, i can have quite big blocks of white space and update pages with random access file handles

2011-09-22T18:01:13  <McLeopold1> delt0r_: static html was a quick a dirty solution to the system having text files for the back end data
2011-09-22T18:02:14  <McLeopold1> It feels like a poor mans caching system
2011-09-22T18:02:52  <McLeopold1> I didn't have anything to clean up old filenames, the just got orphaned by a lack of links
2011-09-22T18:04:29  <McLeopold1> I don't think treating an html file as a random access database is a good idea
2011-09-22T18:05:22  <_flag> Is it just me does the matchmaking tend to be less skill-based now?
2011-09-22T18:05:37  <McLeopold1> _flag: very much so
2011-09-22T18:05:45  <_flag> Why?
2011-09-22T18:05:53  <McLeopold1> if it is skill based, we can't keep the game rates even
2011-09-22T18:06:28  <McLeopold1> but we did just turn down the range of players available as an opponent
2011-09-22T18:07:14  <McLeopold1> we are using a pareto distribution to give us a pool of players close to the seed, so 80% of the time, your first opponent will be within 30 ranks
2011-09-22T18:07:38  <McLeopold1> that may need to be tighted up some more
2011-09-22T18:08:13  <McLeopold1> and by 30 ranks, I mean the 30 closest players in match quality, which is kinda 30 ranks, but not exactly
2011-09-22T18:09:30  <_flag> What if you try to give precedence to players who haven't played recently? The game rate won't be consistent, but maybe it will even out?
2011-09-22T18:11:51  <McLeopold1> we do, but it is the second criteria
2011-09-22T18:12:19  <McLeopold1> the first is preference to players you haven't played yet, then it is total games in last 24 hours
2011-09-22T18:12:29  *** okay|` is now known as okayzed
2011-09-22T18:12:51  <McLeopold1> so, the pool of players to choose from is limited by match quality, then the games counts are used
2011-09-22T18:13:34  <_flag> And if you limit it more top players don't play as often?
2011-09-22T18:13:57  <_flag> I think that's what I remember happening before
2011-09-22T18:14:04  <McLeopold1> well, the seed player is always whoever hasn't played in the longest time
2011-09-22T18:14:23  <McLeopold1> if I limit the pool size, then top players will player other top players more often
2011-09-22T18:15:05  <_flag> That's good right?
2011-09-22T18:15:18  <McLeopold1> mostly, we are trying to find the sweet spot

2011-09-22T19:46:12  <janzert> McLeopold1: isn't simply (rand ^ (1 / a) what you want? i.e if (1 / (rand ^ (1/a)) goes from one to infinity with 1 most common, then (1 / (1 / (rand ^ (1 / a)))) gives 1 to 0 and the two outside divisions just cancel out. (aside, technically to get the inclusive range with b in the original formula I think you have use b / ((1-rand) ^ (1 / a)) but it works out right for the [0, 1) range)
2011-09-22T19:46:49  <McLeopold1> doh
2011-09-22T19:47:14  <McLeopold1> yes, I think that would work

2011-09-22T19:47:51  <McLeopold1> The pareto is working nicely, it's just not pulling in the closest 30 for some reason
2011-09-22T19:48:03  <janzert> hmm
2011-09-22T19:48:05  <McLeopold1> Some of it has to do with excluding players in a matchup
2011-09-22T19:48:19  <McLeopold1> but there are some pulled into the pool that don't make any sense

2011-09-22T20:43:11  <dr0b3rts> I think that p = 1 - (1 - rand) ^ (a / (a-1))  should give you the right distribution. If a = log 5 / log 4 = 1.16, then p is in [0,0.8] 20% of the time and in [0.8,1] 80% of the time.
