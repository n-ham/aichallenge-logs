2012-01-20T12:15:11  <mcstar> why cant a nobel-prize winner biologist trim his quite extensive noise-hair?
2012-01-20T12:15:25  <mcstar> funny, i meant to write nose-hair
2012-01-20T12:15:48  <conor_f> heh
2012-01-20T12:16:06  <conor_f> Obviously part of an ongoing experiment he's running
2012-01-20T12:16:24  <conor_f> like a biologists version of a self portrait :P
2012-01-20T12:16:29  <conor_f> you see PE # 84?
2012-01-20T12:16:40  <mcstar> do i see it?
2012-01-20T12:17:00  <conor_f> http://projecteuler.net/problem=84
2012-01-20T12:17:00  <mcstar> isnt that what you solved yesterday?
2012-01-20T12:17:02  <conor_f> did
2012-01-20T12:17:05  <conor_f> I didn't solve it
2012-01-20T12:17:25  <conor_f> I still needed to implement what happens if you put in the chance cards...
2012-01-20T12:18:04  <mcstar> i stopped reading the problem description when reaching"monopoly"
2012-01-20T12:18:26  <conor_f> haha
2012-01-20T12:18:33  <conor_f> strange, thats what got me interested ;)
2012-01-20T12:19:22  <mcstar> monopoly seems complicated
2012-01-20T12:19:26  <mcstar> i like simpler problems
2012-01-20T12:19:41  <mcstar> for example the 3n+1 problem
2012-01-20T12:19:49  <conor_f> it must be easy enough if I'm attempting it

2012-01-20T12:25:16  <conor_f> can I have case < x && > y ?
2012-01-20T12:25:26  <conor_f> or will I need if statments?

2012-01-20T12:26:43  <mcstar> you can dispatch case on integers
2012-01-20T12:26:47  <conor_f> that's disgusting ffs....
2012-01-20T12:26:53  <conor_f> amm what do you mean??
2012-01-20T12:27:13  <mcstar> well, 1>2 is false, also 0
2012-01-20T12:27:20  <mcstar> 2>1 is true, 1
2012-01-20T12:27:40  <conor_f> ok....
2012-01-20T12:27:42  <conor_f> I know that
2012-01-20T12:27:55  <mcstar> i mean you can handle integer cases
2012-01-20T12:28:02  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-20T12:28:06  <mcstar> so in this way you can handle bool cases
2012-01-20T12:28:16  <mcstar> is that what you were asking for?
2012-01-20T12:29:10  <mcstar> huh?
2012-01-20T12:29:13  <conor_f> amm
2012-01-20T12:29:16  <conor_f> I'm not sure
2012-01-20T12:29:19  <conor_f> I only want to handle ints
2012-01-20T12:29:24  <mcstar> what do you want to achieve?
2012-01-20T12:30:39  <pairofdice> World peace
2012-01-20T12:35:04  <mcstar> i myself would like to have a monkey with four asses
2012-01-20T12:35:53  <conor_f> haha
2012-01-20T12:35:57  <conor_f> mcstar: it's ok
2012-01-20T12:36:08  <conor_f> it didn't need as many if statments as I imagined :P
2012-01-20T12:36:11  <conor_f> only 3
2012-01-20T12:36:25  <conor_f> I'm going to eat now, I'll be back in like 20 mins

2012-01-20T13:28:46  <conor_f> mcstar: want to look at my code and edit what you think is wrong with it?
2012-01-20T13:31:37  <conor_f> weird...
2012-01-20T13:31:47  <conor_f> locally it works fine, on codepad it fails with an overflow
2012-01-20T13:32:55  <mcstar> paste away
2012-01-20T13:36:17  <conor_f> http://codepad.org/wQ3Sc7mi
2012-01-20T13:37:26  <mcstar> compile it with debug turned on and under gdb or whatever, thats the difference probably
2012-01-20T13:41:38  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-20T13:48:00  <mcstar> int counter::get_next_location(int location, board board) {
2012-01-20T13:48:15  <mcstar> first time i see an identifier with the same name as its type
2012-01-20T13:48:32  <mcstar> probably not a good practice
2012-01-20T13:49:08  <mcstar> and you are copying that board much too often i believe

2012-01-20T13:49:57  <mcstar> anyway, that code looks complicated, i cant see whats going on
2012-01-20T13:52:10  <mcstar> conor_f what are you trying to do?
2012-01-20T13:52:46  <mcstar> are you trying to get probabilities?
2012-01-20T13:52:58  <mcstar> i believe you should repeat the SAME experiment a number fo times
2012-01-20T13:53:21  <mcstar> like starting the game couple of thousand times
2012-01-20T13:53:38  <mcstar> as far as i can see, you are just running one game for a pretty long time
2012-01-20T13:54:23  <mcstar> and i dont know why you are dividing with 100000
2012-01-20T13:54:59  <mcstar> (there might be a good reason to do that, but i dont see)
2012-01-20T13:55:53  <conor_f> sorry
2012-01-20T13:55:55  <conor_f> yes
2012-01-20T13:55:59  <conor_f> getting percentages
2012-01-20T13:56:29  <conor_f> dividing by 100000 gets me a percentage
2012-01-20T13:56:43  <mcstar> oh
2012-01-20T13:56:52  <mcstar> im thinking in probabilities
2012-01-20T13:56:52  <conor_f> so maybe run the game for 100 turns 1000 times?
2012-01-20T13:56:58  <mcstar> that in [0,1]

2012-01-20T13:57:23  <mcstar> you need to run it for a longer time probably
2012-01-20T13:57:36  <conor_f> ok
2012-01-20T13:57:39  <mcstar> 1000x1000?
2012-01-20T13:57:50  <conor_f> so every 1000 turns I'll just set the counters location to 0
2012-01-20T13:58:19  <mcstar> i want you to average the runs
2012-01-20T13:58:30  <mcstar> i dont know about the rules
2012-01-20T13:58:31  <conor_f> :/
2012-01-20T13:58:36  <mcstar> does this game end on its own?
2012-01-20T13:58:43  <conor_f> no
2012-01-20T13:58:48  <conor_f> not by just rolling dice
2012-01-20T13:59:01  <conor_f> it ends by bankruptency which we don't have to deal with

2012-01-20T13:59:46  <conor_f> yeah
2012-01-20T13:59:48  <conor_f> >_<
2012-01-20T13:59:51  <conor_f> I found the mistake
2012-01-20T14:00:00  <conor_f> I was doing it for 2 6 by 6 die
2012-01-20T14:00:09  <conor_f> it asks for 2* 4 die
2012-01-20T14:00:20  <pairofdice> ^^
2012-01-20T14:00:34  <mcstar> (it isnt a 6by6 die)
2012-01-20T14:00:44  <conor_f> no
2012-01-20T14:00:51  <conor_f> 2 6 sided die mcstar :P
2012-01-20T14:00:58  <conor_f> I need to do it for 2 4 sided die
2012-01-20T14:01:01  <mcstar> yes, i read the problem

2012-01-20T14:02:17  <conor_f> haha
2012-01-20T14:02:22  <conor_f> worked first time
2012-01-20T14:02:27  <conor_f> at least my code was right :P
2012-01-20T14:03:04  <mcstar> now i just have to figure out what to change, and i have a solution too
2012-01-20T14:03:20  <conor_f> really it can't be that difficult :P
2012-01-20T14:03:23  <conor_f> cheater ;)

2012-01-20T14:14:40  <mcstar> why does he need ssh?
2012-01-20T14:15:09  <conor_f> ....
2012-01-20T14:15:16  <mcstar> if he can use ssh on a machine he can use irc there too
2012-01-20T14:15:21  <conor_f> so he can connect out of his office?
2012-01-20T14:15:25  <mcstar> i dont get the joke if theres any
2012-01-20T14:15:41  <conor_f> I'm guessing that a company wouldn't approve of IRC
2012-01-20T14:15:53  <mcstar> theres webchat always
2012-01-20T14:16:04  <conor_f> whereas with a simple SSH tunnel/connection, he's fine
2012-01-20T14:16:19  <conor_f> imo, ssh + irssi > webchat
2012-01-20T14:16:39  <mcstar> but webchat only needs javascript i think
2012-01-20T14:16:56  <conor_f> yup
2012-01-20T14:16:57  <conor_f> thats all

2012-01-20T14:18:30  <pairofdice> Well, irssi >>> webchat
2012-01-20T14:19:02  <conor_f> irssi :)
2012-01-20T14:19:59  <mcstar> pairofdice im not familiar with that kind of bitshift
2012-01-20T14:20:48  <pairofdice> You wouldn't be
2012-01-20T14:21:10  <pairofdice> Because it's not bitshift
2012-01-20T14:21:12  <mcstar> anyway, with a custom plugin you could probably communicate with the irc server like a webchat client
2012-01-20T14:21:41  <mcstar> pairofdice so is it a redirection?
