2011-01-11T16:45:47  <jmcarthur> i was just thinking... what if we had a pay-what-you-want (allowing $0) entry fee? money could go toward costs and/or a prize pool. no promised benefits for paying at all, just essentially an anonymous donation
2011-01-11T16:46:24  <jmcarthur> kind of inspired by things like the humble indie bundle and stuff
2011-01-11T16:47:41  <Mathnerd314> problem: people don't like choices.
2011-01-11T16:47:50  <jmcarthur> prizes are probably subject to regulatory laws, too
2011-01-11T16:48:25  <Zannick> only prizes with monetary value or export restrictions
2011-01-11T16:51:30  <jmcarthur> well, there goes that idea then
2011-01-11T16:52:57  <Zannick> i would recommend against offering prizes

2011-01-11T18:12:12  <jmcarthur> ready for what?
2011-01-11T18:12:15  <amstan_> coding..
2011-01-11T18:12:17  <amstan_> what else? lol
2011-01-11T18:12:36  <amstan_> jeff's hooked up to his comp, finishing his ant sim
2011-01-11T18:13:12  <Zannick> i can't at the moment
2011-01-11T18:13:39  <Zannick> but figure out which branch we should be using and i'll add when i can
2011-01-11T18:14:49  <amstan_> master should be fine
2011-01-11T18:15:05  <amstan_> though..
2011-01-11T18:15:07  <amstan_> hmm
2011-01-11T18:15:16  <amstan_> hold on, this won't work with jeff's plans
2011-01-11T18:15:22  <amstan_> we should probably continue the pw branch
2011-01-11T18:15:31  <amstan_> and merge pw-worker into it
2011-01-11T18:15:42  <amstan_> janzert: you there?
2011-01-11T18:15:56  <Zannick> pw is a funny name now that it isn't planet_wars anymore
2011-01-11T18:16:24  <Zannick> and i think a clean branch would be better if we're coding from scratch
2011-01-11T18:16:33  <Zannick> (pw has a lot of stuff we don't need, too)
2011-01-11T18:17:36  <janzert> hmm?

2011-01-11T18:25:54  <amstan_> yeah..
2011-01-11T18:26:01  <amstan_> we're not coding from scratch yet though
2011-01-11T18:26:11  <amstan_> we're going by those plans in the topic
2011-01-11T18:26:22  <amstan_> so.. we should maintain that code..
2011-01-11T18:26:25  * Zannick should read /topic more often
2011-01-11T18:26:38  <CIA-6> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan master * r018ee28 / django/contest/models.py : added Map model - http://bit.ly/fie2wR
2011-01-11T18:27:23  <amstan_> janzert: so.. do i just merge the 2 branches
2011-01-11T18:27:30  <amstan_> is there anything i have to worry about?
2011-01-11T18:28:06  <amstan_> a ton of conflicts
2011-01-11T18:28:27  <janzert> yeah, I wouldn't merge necessarily
2011-01-11T18:28:55  <amstan_> but?
2011-01-11T18:29:03  <amstan_> we should have some clean code though..
2011-01-11T18:29:16  <amstan_> you said the compile pipeline from the trunk was not active
2011-01-11T18:29:22  <janzert> I don't remember offhand any files that are used by both at this point but it'll probably be easier to just take the worker backend directory and put it in a worker directory
2011-01-11T18:29:34  <janzert> then strip out the stuff that isn't actually used on a worker
2011-01-11T18:29:53  <janzert> also strip the stuff out of the current backend that is no longer used on the master server
2011-01-11T18:30:14  <janzert> it's a better/more natural separation anyway
2011-01-11T18:30:43  <Zannick> hm, so, reading the roadmap
2011-01-11T18:30:58  <Zannick> it sounds like we want two branches
2011-01-11T18:31:19  <Zannick> one to reuse the old code to get off the ground for this contest
2011-01-11T18:31:42  <Zannick> and another to develop new code for the one after
2011-01-11T18:31:48  <amstan_> Zannick: i have 3 branches now..
2011-01-11T18:31:58  <amstan_> pw* is from the old contest, master is new
2011-01-11T18:32:12  <amstan_> pw is the svn trunk, pw-worker is the worker branch from svn
2011-01-11T18:32:26  <amstan_> i would like to merge the pws or clean them up a little
2011-01-11T18:32:30  <Zannick> oh, okay, so master is the new clean one? and pw is the old one?
2011-01-11T18:32:32  <janzert> actually, compile_anything.py is used by both the master and workers
2011-01-11T18:33:02  <janzert> and should be identical in both branches already
2011-01-11T18:34:02  <amstan_> Zannick: yes, except we won't be using the master one yet
2011-01-11T18:34:09  <amstan_> Zannick: except for the new backend rewrite
2011-01-11T18:34:16  <amstan_> which is not essential at this point
2011-01-11T18:34:29  <Zannick> amstan_: okay.
2011-01-11T18:35:12  <Zannick> i will try to split my time between them, though
2011-01-11T18:35:21  <amstan_> that's what all of us will do

2011-01-11T18:42:14  <Zannick> i was going to work first on rewriting compile_anything, but that isn't quite as necessary as improving the things that need improvement

2011-01-11T19:09:39  <amstan> oh man.. it's so exciting
2011-01-11T19:11:07  <Zannick> it should be possible to tell cia that Alexandru Stan => amstan and such
2011-01-11T19:11:42  <amstan> probably not
2011-01-11T19:11:52  <amstan> it's how it appears in the commit
2011-01-11T19:12:19  <Zannick> one of my other channels uses cia in that manner
2011-01-11T19:12:30  <Zannick> i'm not sure if it's cia or the repo host
2011-01-11T19:12:31  <amstan> yeah, but they probably have a post-commit hook
2011-01-11T19:12:39  <amstan> and you can configure that part
2011-01-11T19:12:40  <Zannick> could be
2011-01-11T19:12:56  <amstan> but.. the github stuff is not flexible in terms of cia settings
2011-01-11T19:13:16  <Zannick> i dunno man
2011-01-11T19:13:32  <amstan> there's 2 buttons: enable and test hook
2011-01-11T19:13:34  <Zannick> it's cool
2011-01-11T19:13:47  <amstan> it submits it to the cia project with the same name
2011-01-11T19:13:51  <amstan> if it's already taken
2011-01-11T19:13:53  <amstan> too bad, lol
2011-01-11T19:14:42  <janzert> amstan: the stuff in the worker branch backend directory, easiest spot to start to get an idea of how it works is probably by looking first at game_server_build.sh
2011-01-11T19:14:56  <janzert> that loads everything onto the worker and sets it up
2011-01-11T19:15:13  <janzert> then start_worker.sh is used to start everything
2011-01-11T19:16:40  <janzert> that will lead you to tournament_manager.py after a couple of steps and there is where the actual work is coordinated
2011-01-11T19:18:22  <janzert> and the basic idea is that it keeps asking the master for a game and gets back a pair of bots and a map, then it downloads/compiles the bots if necessary, runs the game and reports the outcome back to the master

2011-01-11T21:04:04  <jmcarthur> you want to delay that as long as possible while still collecting as much food as possible
2011-01-11T21:04:25  <jmcarthur> so... i guess i can see a little challenge in there
2011-01-11T21:04:34  <jmcarthur> i still can't seem to get excited about it though
2011-01-11T21:12:01  <janzert> I guess my concern is there doesn't seem to be a lot of room for different strategies, just optimization of food gathering and if you have the global state while that optimization is probably still difficult to do it doesn't seem as interesting to me
2011-01-11T21:12:58  <jmcarthur> same here
2011-01-11T21:15:52  <janzert> but I suppose without getting some people writing bots it's probably impossible to tell if that's really true
2011-01-11T21:16:26  <janzert> maybe write a "Greedy" bot then see how hard it is to write something else that beats it
2011-01-11T21:17:36  <janzert> where I define greedy as something like a bot that sends the closest free ant it has toward a food particle and never sends more than one to any particular food

2011-01-11T21:34:34  <jmcarthur> well i don't
2011-01-11T21:34:41  <dmj111> :)
2011-01-11T21:34:42  <jmcarthur> :\
2011-01-11T21:36:01  <jmcarthur> i'm trying to decide if i want to bother with some linux-only code in my engine. it would mean we would finally have a way to time bots based on cpu usage instead of wall clock time
2011-01-11T21:36:16  <jmcarthur> but that functionality would be linux only
2011-01-11T21:38:26  <dmj111> as long as it still works on clock time on windows, if it gets distributed to everyone.  i am assuming the percentage of windows users was pretty high last time.
2011-01-11T21:38:29  <janzert> if you do, remember that you can't use cpu time alone otherwise bot can sleep forever and hang the game from completing
2011-01-11T21:38:57  <janzert> also I would contend that IO wait time should be charged to bots as well
2011-01-11T21:39:41  <janzert> i.e. if you're doing a bunch of disk operations it's your fault that it's slow :P
2011-01-11T21:43:36  <jmcarthur> yeah it wouldn't be CPU time alone
2011-01-11T21:43:56  <jmcarthur> could also include time in the kernel on behalf of the bot
2011-01-11T21:44:25  <jmcarthur> if you're doing a bunch of disk IO you're doing something evil :P
2011-01-11T21:44:53  <janzert> I'm making use of pre-calculated stuff if reading it off disk is free :)
2011-01-11T21:45:53  <jmcarthur> i'll just put this on the "maybe do later" list that i'm keeping in my head
2011-01-11T21:46:55  <janzert> probably a good idea given the criticality of it :)
2011-01-11T21:47:11  <jmcarthur> it would be a lot of work and, well, as much as it sucks i've gotten kind of used to wall clock time

2011-01-11T21:48:01  <jmcarthur> well, it wouldn't be all that much work to *poll* for the bot's cpu time, but blocking on it for a specific amount of cpu time would be more work

2011-01-11T22:02:28  <ssalbiz> amstan: slowness is the major concern
2011-01-11T22:02:49  <amstan> jeff was claiming pretty low overhead, what do you know?
2011-01-11T22:03:07  <ssalbiz> one obstacle that I never really bothered to fix was knowing when the vm was spun up properly (otherwise ssh hangs on response)
2011-01-11T22:03:33  *** medrimonia <medrimonia!~medrimoni@ABordeaux-158-1-77-178.w90-60.abo.wanadoo.fr> has joined #aichallenge
2011-01-11T22:03:35  <ssalbiz> so, from a terminal, doing a single testcase, there is relatively little _perceivable_ overhead
2011-01-11T22:04:18  <amstan> so that's the big overhead then? spinning up the vm?
2011-01-11T22:04:29  <ssalbiz> if you try to open an ssh connection to a vm without a sleep of ~5s in between it turns out that the sshd inside the vm isn't spun up properly yet and bots
2011-01-11T22:04:46  <ssalbiz> after that it's not too bad
2011-01-11T22:05:06  <ssalbiz> problem is getting the vm to signal when sshd is ready to receive incoming connectinos
2011-01-11T22:05:10  <ssalbiz> connections, even
2011-01-11T22:05:32  <ssalbiz> not too hard to solve, but you still end up with ~10s overhead to spin up two contest vms
2011-01-11T22:06:20  <amstan> yeah, that's a lot, we were doing 10 games per minute/machine last contest
2011-01-11T22:06:22  <amstan> i think
2011-01-11T22:06:29  <amstan> janzert could confirm
2011-01-11T22:07:07  <amstan> ssalbiz: what about the stuff we're using now? are you aware of any weakness?
2011-01-11T22:08:26  <ssalbiz> amstan: haven't looked at it in a while, let me refresh my memory
2011-01-11T22:08:29  <ssalbiz> is it the systrace stuff?
2011-01-11T22:09:14  <amstan> hmm
2011-01-11T22:09:30  <amstan> i'm not exactly sure either, let me check the repo
2011-01-11T22:09:47  <amstan> this is it, if you wanna peek: https://github.com/amstan/aichallenge/tree/pw/planet_wars/backend
2011-01-11T22:10:14  <amstan> ssalbiz: it's just the jail
2011-01-11T22:11:17  <jmcarthur> i was just thinking about just using ptrace, but it would be kind of slow
2011-01-11T22:12:13  <jmcarthur> on the other hand, it would make timing based on cpu very easy, so we wouldn't have to worry about unfairness regarding the wall clock timer
2011-01-11T22:12:16  <ssalbiz> jmcarthur: I haven't used ptrace before, is it difficult to configure custom permissions for what invoked shits can/cannot do?
2011-01-11T22:12:35  <ssalbiz> the jvm, for example, needs to open up a bunch of sockets for some reason
2011-01-11T22:12:51  <jmcarthur> ssalbiz: essentially it allows the parent process to decide what to do with all syscalls
2011-01-11T22:13:03  <jmcarthur> really? that makes things difficult then...
2011-01-11T22:13:20  <jmcarthur> because we certainly don't want to just allow arbitrary network access... although a firewall would be fine for that
2011-01-11T22:13:24  <ssalbiz> yeah, one of the many reasons using systrace was sub-optimal
2011-01-11T22:13:42  <jmcarthur> with ptrace you should be able to even decide what to do based on the parameters to the syscall though
2011-01-11T22:15:04  <jmcarthur> anyway, my idea for the timing was that with ptrace you could register a SIGALRM on behalf of the child process that sends the child a signal once it has exhausted its cpu quota for the current turn, but the parent process would be able to get the signal first (and the child would be paused automatically)
2011-01-11T22:15:35  <jmcarthur> downside is that the child wouldn't be able to use SIGALRM
2011-01-11T22:16:15  <ssalbiz> eh, that seems like a fair tradeoff
2011-01-11T22:16:46  <jmcarthur> i also just don't know if i feel like messing with all this right now, although it would make sense since i'm writing an engine anyway
2011-01-11T22:17:12  <ssalbiz> I can look into it over the weekend
2011-01-11T22:17:15  <jmcarthur> my main problem with it is that ptrace is kind of slow
2011-01-11T22:17:20  <jmcarthur> s/kind of/very/
2011-01-11T22:17:54  <ssalbiz> jmcarthur: yeah, running some examples to test concept considered useful
2011-01-11T22:19:12  <jmcarthur> http://www.xs4all.nl/~weegen/eelis/geordi/   <-- this uses ptrace, for reference
2011-01-11T22:19:22  <jmcarthur> and in turn, codepad.org uses a modified version of geordi
2011-01-11T22:21:02  <jmcarthur> based on these comments, it looks like kind of a sucky process https://github.com/Eelis/geordi/raw/master/src/EvalCxx.hsc
2011-01-11T22:21:47  <jmcarthur> but that code is public domain and i'm writing my engine in Haskell anyway, so maybe i could just rip it out and use it
