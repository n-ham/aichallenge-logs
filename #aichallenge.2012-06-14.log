2012-06-14T16:29:54  <mcstar> thestinger: do you know of an irc client that lets you have different channels in separate windows?
2012-06-14T16:30:00  <mcstar> be it console or gui
2012-06-14T16:30:17  <mcstar> and dont count the one from suckless
2012-06-14T16:30:31  <thestinger> different windows? like X11 windows?
2012-06-14T16:30:33  <thestinger> use tmux
2012-06-14T16:30:35  <thestinger> and weechat
2012-06-14T16:30:51  <thestinger> you can have the same weechat open in two terminals
2012-06-14T16:30:52  <mcstar> thats crude
2012-06-14T16:30:56  <thestinger> why?
2012-06-14T16:31:19  <mcstar> i was thinking of some irc daemon, you can attach to
2012-06-14T16:31:44  <thestinger> dtach + weechat then
2012-06-14T16:32:10  <mcstar> anyway, do you know of such client?
2012-06-14T16:32:24  <thestinger> no, but gtk applications tend to do that now
2012-06-14T16:32:33  <thestinger> (having 1 process and new windows are part of the same one)
2012-06-14T16:32:51  <thestinger> but I don't know of any that actually treat it like two views on the same buffers
2012-06-14T16:33:06  <thestinger> dtach + weechat is really what you want though, imo
2012-06-14T16:33:09  <mcstar> you mean these multi protocol im clients?
2012-06-14T16:33:28  <mcstar> gtk ^
2012-06-14T16:33:52  <thestinger> no, I just mean random gtk programs
2012-06-14T16:34:15  <mcstar> i dont want 2 views on the same buffer though
2012-06-14T16:34:29  <mcstar> i want a 1to1 pairing of channels to windows
2012-06-14T16:34:54  <mcstar> we have tiling wm, why bother with windowing stuff in every damn application?
2012-06-14T16:34:54  <thestinger> y u no use splits
2012-06-14T16:35:00  <thestinger> mcstar: true
2012-06-14T16:35:23  <mcstar> screen/tmux are very handy, but imho for networked stuff
2012-06-14T16:35:27  <mcstar> like over ssh
2012-06-14T16:36:09  <mcstar> btw, do you know the suckless irc client?
2012-06-14T16:36:26  <mcstar> it could do this, but i guess it is very very crude
2012-06-14T16:37:11  <thestinger> weechat has splits itself though
2012-06-14T16:37:16  <mcstar> i know
2012-06-14T16:39:04  <mcstar> thestinger: i was thinking about a gui library, that would be a superset of curses
2012-06-14T16:39:26  <mcstar> imagine a curses interface, but wo console
2012-06-14T16:39:36  <mcstar> and + some widgets for necessary graphics
2012-06-14T16:40:13  <mcstar> sounds great, doesnt it?
2012-06-14T16:41:06  <thestinger> yes
2012-06-14T16:41:21  <thestinger> so programs would link against it instead of curses?
2012-06-14T16:41:27  <thestinger> or a fresh start
2012-06-14T16:41:45  <thestinger> I guess you would have to do it from scratch anyway
2012-06-14T16:41:50  <thestinger> since programs draw their own splits, etc.
2012-06-14T16:42:39  <mcstar> possibly wouldnt be backward compatible with curses
2012-06-14T16:42:49  <mcstar> but thats kind of a detail
2012-06-14T16:43:06  <mcstar> well, an important one, cause there are great curses apps
