2011-06-24T02:42:53  <stocha> You could have a bias that choose the best player a litle more often to offset that he has less neighbors.

2011-06-24T06:05:49  <antimatroid> 4 of the types of rotational symmetry for 2 players require square maps
2011-06-24T06:05:54  <antimatroid> 3 can be rectangles
2011-06-24T06:06:13  <Rabidus> happy midsummer festival for all of you!
2011-06-24T06:06:23  <antimatroid> 2 need to be squares for 4 player, 1 can be a rectangle, and needs to be a square for the one type of 8 player rotational symmetry
2011-06-24T06:07:23  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: going to read history and find another comments :)
2011-06-24T06:07:40  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: (19:39:31) antimatroid: so there is one way to do a "rotational" symmetry on a square grid with 8 players, 3 ways with 4 players and 7 ways with 2 players
2011-06-24T06:09:47  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: I thought you'd answered on my comment about that big number.
2011-06-24T06:12:54  <Rabidus> distance function is hard if player is very near but actually other side of the map
2011-06-24T06:13:12  <Rabidus> my a* is crashing over there
2011-06-24T06:13:54  <antimatroid> Rabidus: what do you mean?
2011-06-24T06:14:06  <antimatroid> use the distance function given on the specs page
2011-06-24T06:14:16  <antimatroid> although it can be worthwhile squaring it
2011-06-24T06:14:33  <antimatroid> actually, you probably want to use manhatten for pathfinding
2011-06-24T06:14:36  <Rabidus> like food coordinate is 1,1 and ant is at 1,195 (when map size is 300,300)
2011-06-24T06:14:46  <mcstar> nono he means to wrap on the edges
2011-06-24T06:14:50  <Rabidus> i meant 200 * 200
2011-06-24T06:15:01  <Rabidus> yes
2011-06-24T06:15:04  <Rabidus> that's what i ment
2011-06-24T06:15:16  <mcstar> im educated myself in A* finally
2011-06-24T06:15:19  <mcstar> i really like it
2011-06-24T06:15:29  <mcstar> but i dont want to use graph searching at all

2011-06-24T06:15:56  <antimatroid> mcstar: how to you plan to find food?
2011-06-24T06:16:04  <antimatroid> bfs is also graph searching
2011-06-24T06:16:09  <mcstar> i know
2011-06-24T06:16:25  <mcstar> i try to precompute some things and rely on geometric considerations
2011-06-24T06:17:15  <antimatroid> bad idea :P
2011-06-24T06:17:25  <mcstar> thanks
2011-06-24T06:17:32  <antimatroid> i use a* with multiple sources and multiple targets
2011-06-24T06:18:14  <mcstar> i hate this actually: i look at the map, i immediately know what goes where, why doesnt the computer too???
2011-06-24T06:18:41  <mcstar> so i say to myself, come on, this can be done without searching, just use a proper representation
2011-06-24T06:19:02  <antimatroid> path finding is a pretty common problem :P
2011-06-24T06:19:16  <mcstar> thank you Mr. Obvious :D
2011-06-24T06:19:16  <antimatroid> do you think bfs and a* would be so common if they didn't work so well for the given problem? :P
2011-06-24T06:20:49  <mcstar> it cant hurt to view things from a different angle
2011-06-24T06:21:10  <mcstar> ok, thats not always true

2011-06-24T07:34:32  <mcstar> as long as people's opinions differ
2011-06-24T07:34:46  <mleise> that's true
2011-06-24T07:35:07  <mcstar> i we were the borg, everything would be nice, and we would have much less standards
2011-06-24T07:35:09  <mleise> oh shit, I don't know the map from the beginning
2011-06-24T07:35:16  <mcstar> hehe
2011-06-24T07:35:20  <mcstar> only part of it
2011-06-24T07:35:28  <mcstar> didnt you know that?
2011-06-24T07:35:36  <mleise> I forgot for a second
2011-06-24T07:35:45  <mcstar> i thought about pre-computing "highways"
2011-06-24T07:35:54  <mcstar> but that would have to be incremental too
2011-06-24T07:36:15  <mleise> Yes, I'll incrementally precalculate everything if that makes any sense
2011-06-24T07:36:38  <mcstar> but still, pre-computing individual paths is not feasible
2011-06-24T07:37:34  <mcstar> only, if you really can find a way to make the ai "know" about obstacles, and do a representation of circle-graphs
2011-06-24T07:38:08  <mcstar> so you can make an ant join, or to make it go in the vicinity of a highway
2011-06-24T07:38:39  <mcstar> and then, when the destination is reached within a specified perimeter, it will deviate from it
2011-06-24T07:38:47  <mcstar> of course this is a bit too general
2011-06-24T07:39:12  <mcstar> because usually you dont want to send the ants to ANY distance, only in its viewradius
2011-06-24T07:39:44  <mcstar> thats one reason i dont want to fully implement an A* for example, i think its an overkill
2011-06-24T07:44:46  <mcstar> please, dont say anything, really
2011-06-24T07:45:02  <mcstar> im not interested, thats why i wrote 7 lines
2011-06-24T07:45:05  <mcstar> for the fun of it
2011-06-24T07:45:15  <mcstar> why not i say, i like typing
2011-06-24T07:45:22  <mcstar> it improves sexual performance
2011-06-24T07:45:33  <mcstar> or is it running, i cant recall
2011-06-24T07:46:27  <mleise> mcstar: I was afk, no need to feel like an abandonned child, haha
2011-06-24T07:46:51  <mcstar> i was afraid, daddy
2011-06-24T07:47:05  <mleise> I wonder if there isn't any case where you want to send an ant into the unexplored area of the map.
2011-06-24T07:47:27  <mleise> but maybe you could just as well send it to the border of the view radius
2011-06-24T07:48:38  <mcstar> yeah, and again and again if nothing interesting is in view
2011-06-24T07:49:09  <mleise> Anyway it may be a bad idea to cripple the pathfinding early on. Later you may find a use for longer routes and then you aren't motivated to go back to pathfinding
2011-06-24T07:49:20  <mcstar> but usually this is not the case, the map tends to be crowded
2011-06-24T07:50:11  <mcstar> actually i dont intend to cripple it
2011-06-24T07:50:15  <mleise> in that case the focus should be on collision avoidance and optimal planning of what ant goes first
2011-06-24T07:50:25  <mcstar> it would remain stable and robust
2011-06-24T07:50:39  <mcstar> only difference is that it might not find the absolute shortest route
2011-06-24T07:51:29  <mcstar> so what else do you plan to precompute?
2011-06-24T07:52:05  <mleise> nothing, I'm just trying to cache whatever is feasible
2011-06-24T07:52:20  <antimatroid> i use the start up time to make my grid into a graph
2011-06-24T07:52:32  <antimatroid> then as i receive water information i remove neighbour information from squares
2011-06-24T07:52:48  <mcstar> antimatroid: a struct with 4 legs?
2011-06-24T07:52:49  <mleise> I estimate the map size and memory requirements for the data structures and if it is ~100 MB it can be done :p
2011-06-24T07:53:01  <mcstar> and an array of those of course?
2011-06-24T07:53:44  <mcstar> cause i beleive if i really wantod represent it as a "graph" i would use binary number system
2011-06-24T07:53:56  <mcstar> ____ for NWSE

2011-06-24T07:55:15  <mcstar> well, an integer would represent the conenctivity
2011-06-24T07:55:29  <mcstar> can be faster than always fetching nbors, and checking their values
2011-06-24T07:56:16  <mcstar> squares vector? you mean that you represent the board in 1D as me?
2011-06-24T07:56:39  <antimatroid> no, i have a grid which is a 2-dimensional vector of Square structs
2011-06-24T07:56:51  <antimatroid> then each square struct has a vector of Locations to neighbours that aren't water
2011-06-24T07:57:04  <mcstar> lol, isnt it an array? in cs a vector is always 1d
2011-06-24T07:57:26  <antimatroid> yes, but i still have it as a 2-dimensional array, it's just easier
2011-06-24T07:57:28  <aerique> antimatroid: I initially used a 'normal' distance function for A*, but using manhattan distance gave better results (less iterations to find the same route)
2011-06-24T07:57:40  <antimatroid> i could probably change that actually, because I have index functions that would do it for me

2011-06-24T07:59:30  <antimatroid> aerique: sounds messy :P
2011-06-24T07:59:47  <mcstar> euclidian distance is very different than manhattan, even more for large distances
2011-06-24T07:59:59  <antimatroid> aerique: http://pastebin.com/Z1a9T7wu :P
2011-06-24T08:00:06  <antimatroid> ignore the comment :P
2011-06-24T08:00:11  <mcstar> its nice that a rectangle has all the equally short paths
2011-06-24T08:00:32  <antimatroid> that's my heuristic function for a* with multiple targets
2011-06-24T08:01:01  <mleise> antimatroid: depends. static arrays of byte[256][256] are 1-D, but dynamic arrays of byte[][] are really 2-D
2011-06-24T08:02:07  <aerique> antimatroid: cheers :)
2011-06-24T08:03:07  <mleise> mcstar: you just present all the thoughts I had yesterday during a walk through the park
2011-06-24T08:03:21  <mcstar> :)
2011-06-24T08:03:32  <mcstar> i have themfor some time
2011-06-24T08:04:50  <antimatroid> aerique: i'm not positive it's faster doing this than just bfs with that heuristic function
2011-06-24T08:05:07  <mleise> I also don't think I'll use the multiple targets idea for finding the path to an enemy ant or food. I can think of something slightly faster, hmm... if it works?
2011-06-24T08:05:17  <antimatroid> the search path is much smaller, but a bfs is probably faster if you have lots of food with some close to ants
2011-06-24T08:05:33  <antimatroid> mleise: you can do it with bfs fairly easily
2011-06-24T08:05:59  <antimatroid> with a* the heuristic function can be painful, you have to call it for every location added to your search queue
2011-06-24T08:05:59  <mleise> nah, everyone uses it, i need something else,just because
2011-06-24T08:06:16  <mcstar> mleise: exactly
2011-06-24T08:06:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: the heuristic function is very cheap
2011-06-24T08:06:56  <aerique> antimatroid: have you tried weighted a* yet? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*#Weighted_A.2A)
2011-06-24T08:07:02  <mcstar> why not call it every time?
2011-06-24T08:07:21  <mcstar> maybe optimize it a bit, but its not a problem i guess
2011-06-24T08:07:21  <aerique> antimatroid: gives almost the same routes but much less iterations
2011-06-24T08:07:52  <antimatroid> aerique: i don't understand what weighted a* is? (i read the link...)
2011-06-24T08:08:18  <mcstar> aerique: still, it is for hard-maps and it is very general
2011-06-24T08:08:41  <aerique> antimatroid: you just multiply your h by a value > 1
2011-06-24T08:08:53  <antimatroid> aerique: who the hell would i do that? :P
2011-06-24T08:09:00  <antimatroid> i have had a different idea for path finding
2011-06-24T08:09:14  <mleise> Oo
2011-06-24T08:09:28  <aerique> antimatroid: you didn't read the link then :)
2011-06-24T08:09:40  <aerique> anyway, back to work for me
2011-06-24T08:09:41  <antimatroid> make information about the shortest number of turns an enemy ant could get in battle range of each land square, then use that to disclude squares while searching to avoid enemies
2011-06-24T08:11:16  <mcstar> lol, thats a lot of calculation isnt it?
2011-06-24T08:11:49  <mcstar> just consider that possibly, you can see more enemies than your own ants
2011-06-24T08:11:59  <antimatroid> it's one pass of the entire grid to get information like that
2011-06-24T08:12:23  <mcstar> but you want to keep that info up to date i guess
2011-06-24T08:12:27  <mcstar> you have to do it again
2011-06-24T08:12:32  <antimatroid> yeah, you would have to do it once per turn
2011-06-24T08:12:33  <antimatroid> fairly cheap
2011-06-24T08:12:54  <mcstar> idk
2011-06-24T08:13:19  <antimatroid> compared to my iterative path finding to collect food and enemies, that is almost free
2011-06-24T08:14:09  <mcstar> you know, the problem is that it would not be stable
2011-06-24T08:14:30  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-06-24T08:14:43  <mcstar> consider that for every turn you precompute your path to a target, but it can change when an enemy ant changes position
2011-06-24T08:14:48  <antimatroid> for a given turn, i can calculate the information based off the enemy ants i see then use that information with my path finding
2011-06-24T08:15:00  <antimatroid> i don't store information across turns
2011-06-24T08:15:05  <mcstar> it can happen that your ant cant monotonically decrease its distance from the start
2011-06-24T08:15:06  <antimatroid> i recalculate everything from scratch
2011-06-24T08:17:15  <mcstar> oh, and the new viewradius isnt that much larger than the battleradius
2011-06-24T08:17:21  <mcstar> right?
2011-06-24T08:17:24  <antimatroid> what?
2011-06-24T08:17:34  <antimatroid> attack2=5 and view2 = 77 yeah?
2011-06-24T08:17:52  <mcstar> 77?
2011-06-24T08:17:55  <mcstar> it was 55
2011-06-24T08:17:58  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-24T08:18:00  <antimatroid> then it went up
2011-06-24T08:18:07  <mcstar> aaa who can follow this....
2011-06-24T08:18:16  <antimatroid> it's beta
2011-06-24T08:18:21  <antimatroid> we're trying to work out what works best
2011-06-24T08:18:27  <mcstar> aaa i dont care aaaa
2011-06-24T08:18:30  <mcstar> :D
2011-06-24T08:20:28  <mcstar> shat, there are soo many variants of these pathf. algs.

2011-06-24T08:37:43  <Zaphus> ever considered stopping food after N turns, so it stops being area control and turns into a fight ?
2011-06-24T08:58:04  <antimatroid> Zaphus: i had not
2011-06-24T08:59:05  <antimatroid> i kind of like the idea of two cutoff points
2011-06-24T08:59:15  <antimatroid> one where food spawning stops then another where the game is actually called off
2011-06-24T08:59:24  <Zaphus> yep
2011-06-24T08:59:56  <Zaphus> just my observation that games are area control right now
2011-06-24T09:00:27  <antimatroid> there's no battle bots :P
2011-06-24T09:00:35  <antimatroid> well sir_macelon and flag, but they're clearly winning :P
2011-06-24T09:01:26  <antimatroid> or are you battling as well now?
2011-06-24T09:05:13  <Zaphus> not yet, except when the stars align
2011-06-24T09:06:29  <antimatroid> i'm working on a new map generator
2011-06-24T09:06:37  <antimatroid> it's going to do rotational symmetry too
2011-06-24T09:07:04  <Zaphus> get an empty map in there !
2011-06-24T09:07:20  <antimatroid> i've made maxLandProportion 0.99
2011-06-24T09:07:24  <antimatroid> i can make it 1.0
2011-06-24T09:07:33  <antimatroid> it'd still be quite unlikely i expect
2011-06-24T09:07:41  <Zaphus> .99 is effectively empty
2011-06-24T09:09:36  <Zaphus> zelark has improved
2011-06-24T09:10:41  <Zaphus> wish we could put the snake, blobby and other 'interesting' bots into the official contest for people to see - but I'm not wastng my one login on them

2011-06-24T11:08:13  <mleise> antimatroid: can you write a map editor for the web?
2011-06-24T11:09:13  <mcstar> antimatroid is turing complete, so yes, he can do it
2011-06-24T11:09:47  <mleise> hmm so can css3 then
2011-06-24T11:10:02  <mcstar> yeah, i heard
2011-06-24T11:10:21  <mcstar> i meant this as a joke, turing completeness is overused, and isnt really funny anymore :(
2011-06-24T11:11:07  <mcstar> but i never really programmed in antimatroid, i beleive its a dialect of cpp
2011-06-24T11:11:50  <mleise> oh is it better than cx00?
2011-06-24T11:12:35  <mcstar> sure, it has the capability of overloading everything, like >> or <<
2011-06-24T11:12:38  <mleise> does antimatroid work with templates?
2011-06-24T11:12:52  <mcstar> it gives an unprecedented flexibitlity to antimatroid
2011-06-24T11:12:57  <mleise> ah yes and switch operator precedence as well
2011-06-24T11:12:58  <mcstar> yes sure that too
2011-06-24T11:13:02  <antimatroid> mleise: i do use templates
2011-06-24T11:13:06  <antimatroid> i don't know how to do web sutff
2011-06-24T11:13:32  <mcstar> antimatroid doesnt have those libraries it seems, in time it will evolve

2011-06-24T11:18:58  <mleise> haha
2011-06-24T11:19:42  <stocha> mcstar: mm, i don't know. I think you were saying you don't want to do this (path finding ?) and you want to do that (highway precalculated incrementally ?). And someone would tell you that pathfinding is important or so.
2011-06-24T11:19:47  <mleise> once queens of the stoneage played in a studio in the netherlands and said "diamonds in scheisse"
2011-06-24T11:19:53  <stocha> i didn't read it very carfully really :)
2011-06-24T11:20:02  <mcstar> ah the logs
2011-06-24T11:20:07  <mcstar> you read them? nice
2011-06-24T11:20:20  <stocha> mcstar: alles goed.
2011-06-24T11:20:28  <mcstar> gut
2011-06-24T11:20:47  <stocha> mcstar: i'm excited because i uploaded my new prototype.
2011-06-24T11:21:01  <stocha> it's a slow bot if there is one. but still i want to see how things go with it :p
2011-06-24T11:21:28  <mcstar> whats the improvement?
2011-06-24T11:21:29  <stocha> (more than 30 time slower than my fast ref - running under stoha02 at the moment)
2011-06-24T11:21:31  <mleise> is it written in jave
2011-06-24T11:21:51  <stocha> mcstar:  it the trying of a brand new stuff i didn't have in my framework before.
2011-06-24T11:22:09  <mcstar> stocha improved his bot: now its 30 times slower, to give chance to the enemies :D
2011-06-24T11:22:14  <stocha> mleise: yeah. now that java works, i' probably stick to it. unless i really have time on my hands :p
2011-06-24T11:22:25  <stocha> mcstar: it's slower thinking :)
2011-06-24T11:22:51  <mcstar> remember to wash your hands if you have time onthem
2011-06-24T11:22:55  <stocha> mcstar: i hope it'll be slightly stronger than my ref greedy.
2011-06-24T11:23:09  <stocha> i didn't try it at home. i just wanted to see how it does on the real thing.
2011-06-24T11:23:40  <stocha> then i'll also see how fast it goes on the server, and maps.
2011-06-24T11:23:48  <stocha> because there an embeded time monitor.
2011-06-24T11:24:44  <stocha> in about 5.3463 minutes. i'll go on an errand on come back in a few minute then.

2011-06-24T12:08:58  <antimatroid> those two break for some reason
2011-06-24T12:09:04  <janzert> I'd like to see some maps that feel fundamentally different from the current 'random blob' maps rather than just different symmetries of 'random blob' ;)
2011-06-24T12:10:31  <antimatroid> hopefully it's not too hard to adds more types of maps into this generator
2011-06-24T12:10:39  <janzert> good
2011-06-24T12:10:49  <antimatroid> it's all in one big class thing though
2011-06-24T12:10:57  <antimatroid> which is a bit rank, but my python fu is lacking
2011-06-24T12:11:30  <antimatroid> i'm going to translate the maps too
2011-06-24T12:11:40  <antimatroid> i think that should make it even harder to work out the type of symmetry

2011-06-24T13:00:56  <antimatroid> consider those examples
2011-06-24T13:01:01  <antimatroid> i need to start 'a' in the same location'

2011-06-24T13:01:48  <McLeopold> antimatroid: your going to need a row *and* col :)
2011-06-24T13:01:58  <antimatroid> yeah that's not the problem
2011-06-24T13:02:07  <McLeopold> and make the last part just 'ne'
2011-06-24T13:02:10  <antimatroid> the problem is that 'a' isn't always in the same relative symmetric place
2011-06-24T13:02:14  <mleise> well, type "ant" and it tells you to type "ant -p" which tells you what commands are available
2011-06-24T13:02:31  <antimatroid> so i can't always make him ne then etc.
2011-06-24T13:02:32  <McLeopold> I wanted a copy paste from the wiki, but it's gone :(
2011-06-24T13:02:33  <antimatroid> it breaks
2011-06-24T13:02:54  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you could, they are all relative directions anyway
2011-06-24T13:03:14  <antimatroid> that first map the directions don't work right?
2011-06-24T13:03:18  <mleise> there was a wiki page on how to use ant?
2011-06-24T13:03:31  <antimatroid> whereas for the second map they do, they are listed from a onwards
2011-06-24T13:04:00  <antimatroid> McLeopold: have we got food spawn code for this?
2011-06-24T13:04:08  <antimatroid> i would be interested in testing this once it's done...

2011-06-24T13:12:01  <janzert> I'm thinking I might try and make them a little more robust in that regard if they keep having a problem
2011-06-24T13:12:06  <McLeopold> janzert: is there a python traceback?
2011-06-24T13:12:15  <janzert> yes, there was

2011-06-24T13:44:25  <McLeopold> 2 clicks, and a paste
2011-06-24T13:44:30  <antimatroid> i have a couple of things i want to do yet..
2011-06-24T13:44:40  <McLeopold> I can't really visualize them as raw text....
2011-06-24T13:44:44  <McLeopold> :p
2011-06-24T13:45:19  <antimatroid> 1. translate the rotationally symmetric maps to make it harder to work out the type of symmetry, 2. make is so i can check that an nxn block can traverse the land rather than a 1x1 block
2011-06-24T13:47:05  <antimatroid> i have 5 types of rotation symmetry for 2 player games, 3 types for 4 player games and 1 for 8 player games
2011-06-24T13:47:42  <McLeopold> can you fix maps if the nxn fails?
2011-06-24T13:48:14  <antimatroid> i have an is_valid function that makes sure a 1x1 block
2011-06-24T13:48:24  <antimatroid> the idea is to make that use an nxn block
2011-06-24T13:48:27  <antimatroid> so yes
2011-06-24T13:48:47  <antimatroid> i currently have nxn blocks carving land out of water

2011-06-24T14:01:02  <stocha> has the thing crashed ? or is there a very long game running ?
2011-06-24T14:01:27  <carlop> McLeopold: a possible solution for relation map/food generator, is let the food generator find the type of simmetry
2011-06-24T14:02:37  <carlop> fixed the orientation of a ant (say NE), you can choose another ant, try every possible orientation (at most 8)
2011-06-24T14:02:45  <carlop> at most eight9
2011-06-24T14:02:47  <carlop> )
2011-06-24T14:03:30  <carlop> so the food generation code can fast understand what type of symmetry has the map, without need to encoding
2011-06-24T14:04:39  <carlop> (and the symmetry finder is O(number of total cell), so it shold run very fast)

2011-06-24T15:55:19  <UncleVasya> wow. Am I missed some improvement to the server? Because just now my 14th version had a game instead of 16th and it makes me feel like "wow!" :)

2011-06-24T15:56:01  <janzert> on the next game stuff, how about changing the verbiage for the next game to "Your next game should be within" ?
2011-06-24T15:56:24  <janzert> then try and make the calculation the maximum time till the game
2011-06-24T15:56:39  <janzert> it might simplify the logic that way?
2011-06-24T15:56:44  <McLeopold> ok

2011-06-24T19:16:20  <McLeopold> janzert: we have proof that the top bots are getting few games http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/rankings.php
2011-06-24T19:17:14  <mleise> McLeopold: You really do want maps without player starts? What is the use case?
2011-06-24T19:18:38  <McLeopold> mleise: just for pasting maps to ant paste
2011-06-24T19:18:58  <McLeopold> I just want the error to be ignored.
2011-06-24T19:19:04  <McLeopold> I suppose I could add the debug flag?
2011-06-24T19:19:59  <mleise> yes, that should do the trick, but it is not very elegant to put it as a get parameter I guess
2011-06-24T19:21:36  <McLeopold> how do I add the debug flag without a querystring?
2011-06-24T19:22:51  <mleise> let me take a look at my source code. it is 1:20 am here.
2011-06-24T19:24:29  <mleise> well, there is no way currently, to do this. only 'interactive' and 'dataDir' can be set through the get parameters
2011-06-24T19:26:03  <mleise> McLeopold: then again you could create the visualizer and then add "vis.options['debug'] = true;"
2011-06-24T19:27:16  <mleise> Since in JavaScript everything can be changed you don't need some getter or setter for that.
2011-06-24T19:27:29  <McLeopold> visualizer.vis.options?
2011-06-24T19:27:47  <mleise> vis would by the variable that you store the visualizer instance in.
2011-06-24T19:28:21  <mleise> vis = new Visualizer(...); vis.options['debug'] = true;
2011-06-24T19:28:46  <mleise> then load the map
2011-06-24T19:29:00  <McLeopold> woot \o/ http://ants.zeroviz.us/BqmlS/
2011-06-24T19:29:36  <McLeopold> I would like to point out how nicely my cell maze tiles :)
2011-06-24T19:29:43  <mleise> hey the water looks like rivers now :)
2011-06-24T19:30:24  <mleise> does this map have any kind of symmetry?
2011-06-24T19:30:38  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-06-24T19:31:01  <McLeopold> I've half wrote the symmetry
2011-06-24T19:32:43  <mleise> yeah, but it's looking good so far. very... organic
2011-06-24T19:34:41  <mleise> McLeopold: you could probably also replace all '#fff' with your yellowish background color *g*
2011-06-24T19:35:16  <McLeopold> what yellow?
2011-06-24T19:37:24  <mleise> the page background
2011-06-24T19:37:29  <carlop> McLeopond: maybe you want to take a look this link about wallpaper tessellation(that is the problem of design ant map): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_p4m
2011-06-24T19:38:19  <mleise> carlop: The link you sent me, what is wrong there? It renders ok for me.
2011-06-24T19:39:05  <McLeopold> carlop: yeah, I read that, it looks good
2011-06-24T19:39:20  <carlop> i see only one the upper right ant attacking, and the bottom one do nothing
2011-06-24T19:42:08  <carlop> McLeopold: tomorrow i try to find all possible symmetry group that give interesting map, and try to generate few map, there is a lot of fun on map generation

2011-06-24T19:50:01  <mleise> I'll fix it tomorrow
2011-06-24T19:50:38  <carlop> maybe you can draw every item at (r,c) near the border another time at (r-num_row, c), so the other part of circle is draw, or something similar
2011-06-24T19:50:53  <CIA-48> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rd761c39 / website/profile.php : added funny message - http://bit.ly/mdNBu1
2011-06-24T19:51:14  <carlop> but i think this is a minor fix, that can be done after launch without problem
2011-06-24T19:52:23  <mleise> carlop: sure, and the more general case is checking the bounding-box, use some modulo operation on it so it starts left most and top most and then redraw it while increasing x and y by width and height of map until the bounding-box would be outside the map
2011-06-24T19:53:35  <mleise> (that way objects 5x the map size would still be repeated often enough, like a trace of an ant that moved several times from left to rigth through the map)
2011-06-24T19:54:26  <mleise> I mean, I have the code for that, its just a dull copy and paste every time :p

2011-06-24T21:18:03  <stocha> there is simply to much parameters in my bot already :'(
2011-06-24T21:19:09  <stocha> i have no idea how to sort them. On some map size it does better than my ref_greedy bot. On others it does far worse. Are the parameters good or not ? And then i have also the feature. Which one should i keep, and which one is not usefull ? I have no idea.
2011-06-24T21:19:22  <stocha> i don't even have an idea about how to test it.
2011-06-24T21:19:43  <stocha> Zaphus: do you have any suggestions ? :)
2011-06-24T21:20:01  <Zaphus> stocha:  what's the question ?
2011-06-24T21:20:15  <Zaphus> oh
2011-06-24T21:20:21  <stocha> Zaphus: how do i tune my parameters / sort my features.
2011-06-24T21:20:24  <antimatroid> bah python fail
2011-06-24T21:20:31  <antimatroid> how do i copy a list without it being the same copy?
2011-06-24T21:20:34  <antimatroid> like "old_map = self.map_data"
2011-06-24T21:20:39  <stocha> When i have no idea what the final map / bots will be like.
2011-06-24T21:21:15  <stocha> Even if it was 1vs1 i'll be troubled.
2011-06-24T21:21:21  <Zaphus> The truth is, on different maps/etc some bots will do better than others - you need to find the best compromise.   I do this by playing a 'gauntlet' of matches and watching which one rises to the top (I'm using win percentage at the moment but may change that)
2011-06-24T21:21:24  <stocha> but there, i just have no idea.
2011-06-24T21:21:46  <stocha> what's a gauntlet ?
2011-06-24T21:22:02  <antimatroid> stocha: i find it easiest to consider simple general cases, then build my strategy up as generally as possible from that
2011-06-24T21:22:23  <Zaphus> stocha: the important thing I do is watch the rate that my bot finishes above each of my other bots, so if my top bot is losing 100% of the time to another bot it means it is strong but has a specific weakness
2011-06-24T21:22:25  <stocha> antimatroid: it doesn't sound very optimized.
2011-06-24T21:22:52  <antimatroid> stocha: it works surprisingly well
2011-06-24T21:22:54  <stocha> Zaphus: you test it against your other bots ?
2011-06-24T21:23:11  <stocha> antimatroid: i'm not convinced yet. But at least, you have a plan :)
2011-06-24T21:23:38  <Zaphus> stocha:  gauntlet...    "an onlsaught or attack from all sides"   (it has other meanings, but thats the one I mean)
2011-06-24T21:23:44  <antimatroid> anyone here know python?
2011-06-24T21:23:54  <antimatroid> this is like the last tweak of my map gen and meant to be an easy one :(
2011-06-24T21:24:03  <antimatroid> amstan: you here?
2011-06-24T21:24:15  <stocha> Zaphus: i have many bots now. Some are even quite different from others (but the most originals are sadly weak)
2011-06-24T21:24:20  <Zaphus> stocha: yes, I keep the .exe versions of older bots to test against.  means I tend to get 50-50 results until I make noticable improvements
2011-06-24T21:24:31  <Zaphus> it also takes a long time to run the tests :-)
2011-06-24T21:24:32  <stocha> Zaphus: but the map influences the result so much ... i don't know.
2011-06-24T21:25:21  <Zaphus> stocha: right now I do 4-player maps.  All maps, all combinations of 4 bots .   I also track the win rate on the different maps.
2011-06-24T21:25:23  <stocha> Zaphus: a yes, my not having any available test machines criples my habits also.  I would simply play 2000 games against each of my references bots then. But i can't.
2011-06-24T21:25:37  <stocha> Zaphus:  you don't add 1vs1 ?
2011-06-24T21:25:48  <stocha> 1vs1 is my main line of information.
2011-06-24T21:25:50  <antimatroid> i don't like testing with lots of games either
2011-06-24T21:25:54  <Zaphus> stocha: not yet, but I have "sleeperbot" for that
2011-06-24T21:26:01  <antimatroid> i prefer to test on examples i can decompose to work out what my bot is actually doing
2011-06-24T21:26:09  <antimatroid> then find cases where it breaks from what i want to do
2011-06-24T21:26:16  <stocha> antimatroid: that's important too.
2011-06-24T21:26:20  <antimatroid> then go ahead and decompose it until i work out hwat is going wrong
2011-06-24T21:26:40  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  I prefer to start the tests, go and eat nachos and watch the footy :-)
2011-06-24T21:26:51  <antimatroid> Zaphus: yeah i will do that on tcp
2011-06-24T21:26:59  <stocha> Zaphus:  that also is important :)
2011-06-24T21:27:01  <antimatroid> but only to look for errors, then i need to go and replicate them
2011-06-24T21:27:35  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  I have no way to replicate at the moment, interested to hear how you do that
2011-06-24T21:27:36  <stocha> i only need a few hundreds euros, and i would buy a cheap slient machine. then i can test on it. Sadly i don't have any money left for the time being.
2011-06-24T21:29:11  <amstan> antimatroid: yes?
2011-06-24T21:29:41  <antimatroid> amstan: i'm trying to translate my map, but when I do "old_map = self.map_data" which is a list (of lists), then it seems to be the same copy?
2011-06-24T21:29:50  <antimatroid> so when i update self.map_data, it seems to change old_map
2011-06-24T21:30:02  <antimatroid> how do i make an actual copy of self.map_data?
2011-06-24T21:30:46  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/MF5aXcSw here's some sample maps, a 2x2 block can traverse all land squares
2011-06-24T21:30:57  <stocha> yeah, my bot won two game in a row. Although i already want to update it .... i probably should go to sleep in fact. It's 3:30 am here.
2011-06-24T21:31:47  <stocha> antimatroid: why not simply go with a 100% ground map ? then there is no blocking problems :p
2011-06-24T21:31:55  <Zaphus> just realised I never saved the code for "MrBlobby"  - doh!
2011-06-24T21:31:57  <antimatroid> stocha: variation in maps is good
2011-06-24T21:32:04  <antimatroid> what do you guys think of those maps?
2011-06-24T21:32:37  *** carlop <carlop!~chatzilla@2-227-10-134.ip183.fastwebnet.it> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-24T21:33:14  <stocha> antimatroid: i think they are good as widely open maps. hardly as corridor maps though.
2011-06-24T21:33:31  <amstan> antimatroid: python does shallow copies all the time
2011-06-24T21:33:35  <antimatroid> yeah, random walks doesn't really do maze like maps well
2011-06-24T21:33:51  <amstan> antimatroid: you want a new copy for sure? then you need to look at the deepcopy library
2011-06-24T21:33:54  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  I think they look good.  although I would like to see some maze-like maps too
2011-06-24T21:34:20  <antimatroid> Zaphus: yeah same, it needs to be done with something other than random walks though
2011-06-24T21:34:23  <stocha> it's okay for both wide open map, and corridor maps. But here you only look like you can achieve wide open one.
2011-06-24T21:34:26  <antimatroid> these are all just random walks with nxn blocks
2011-06-24T21:35:02  <stocha> antimatroid: you should use both a nxn, then refine with a 1x1 block.
2011-06-24T21:35:19  <stocha> so once you have connected each edge, you can then built tiny corridors.
2011-06-24T21:35:20  <antimatroid> i have like 30 walks with min/max_block_size defined
2011-06-24T21:35:21  <stocha> maybe.
2011-06-24T21:35:45  <antimatroid> but i need min_block_size to be <= block_size required to traverse the grid, otherwise the map gen takes ages
2011-06-24T21:36:05  <antimatroid> it's already taking up to a second or two for maps sometimes
2011-06-24T21:36:34  <antimatroid> erm
2011-06-24T21:36:36  <antimatroid> >=*
2011-06-24T21:41:41  <antimatroid> amstan: i have lots of types of symmetry for you now
2011-06-24T21:42:09  <antimatroid> i had tessellation, now for 2 players i have 5 types of rotational symmetry, 3 types for 4 players and 1 type for 8 players
2011-06-24T21:42:56  <Zaphus> antimatroid: how do you feed test cases to your bot ?
2011-06-24T21:43:08  <antimatroid> Zaphus: input file
2011-06-24T21:43:24  <antimatroid> if you have an ifstream if, you can do if >> state
2011-06-24T21:43:48  <antimatroid> or just paste it into the command window when running the bot
2011-06-24T21:44:05  <Zaphus> but where does the state come from ?
2011-06-24T21:44:14  <antimatroid> i make it?
2011-06-24T21:44:21  <antimatroid> in a .txt document

2011-06-24T21:44:33  <antimatroid> the c++ starter bot has a state struct too
2011-06-24T21:44:50  <Zaphus> hmm - I guess I don't know what it is I'd be making to feed in to it
2011-06-24T21:45:03  <antimatroid> look at the sample input on the specs page
2011-06-24T21:45:19  <antimatroid> just copy that and edit the ant/water info to meet your debug requirement
2011-06-24T21:45:44  <antimatroid> the c+++ bot has operater>>(istream, state) defined for reading state information
2011-06-24T21:46:08  <antimatroid> it uses cin >> state to get the state info from the engine, but you can just as easily pass pseudo state info from an input file
2011-06-24T21:46:15  <Zaphus> oh, thats ugly...  very manual process then figuring out the coords of each bit of water and ants just to make a test case ?
2011-06-24T21:46:42  <antimatroid> i usually plonk an ant somewhere then work out the relative information for my debug case
2011-06-24T21:46:53  <antimatroid> you could always write a separate input function which read a char map for you
2011-06-24T21:47:01  <antimatroid> but i'd prefer not to messy things with that
2011-06-24T21:47:49  <Zaphus> yeah, guess that makes sense... not sure if I'll be bothered :-)

2011-06-24T22:16:02  <antimatroid> _flag: not sure
2011-06-24T22:16:07  <antimatroid> i can make them as wide as i want now
2011-06-24T22:16:36  <antimatroid> i'm fairly tempted to make it so that a 3x3 block can traverse maos
2011-06-24T22:17:03  <antimatroid> that doesn't remove the possibility of two regions being joined at one place with a 1 square opening, but it does mean there's a way around it
2011-06-24T22:18:22  <_flag> As long as it isn't absurdly narrow it should be fine
2011-06-24T22:18:41  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-24T22:18:57  <antimatroid> although, if the water was all 1 width it could be quite interesting
2011-06-24T22:19:02  <antimatroid> a full maze like that?
2011-06-24T22:19:02  <antimatroid> :P
2011-06-24T22:19:15  <antimatroid> 1 width land corridors too
2011-06-24T22:19:21  <antimatroid> that would be psycho

2011-06-24T22:24:10  <antimatroid> _flag: http://pastebin.com/1zghWJVy lots more types of symmetry :)
2011-06-24T22:25:21  <_flag> Nice, looks a lot less random than your other ones
2011-06-24T22:26:10  <antimatroid> i think the rotational maps do that
2011-06-24T22:26:17  <antimatroid> all the old ones are tessellation ones
2011-06-24T22:28:45  <_flag> What do you think about making maps with well-defined shapes? For example a map made of circles, squares, triangles, etc.
2011-06-24T22:29:43  <antimatroid> yeah mcleopold had a cool map generator where he'd place circles on the map then join them up to make a graph with lines
2011-06-24T22:30:08  <antimatroid> i should be able to add more types of maps in with the different symmetry types
2011-06-24T22:30:30  <antimatroid> i just need to write the functions to do it for one player, then i have functions to pick out the symmetrically equivalent squares for whatever symmetry i have
2011-06-24T22:30:34  <_flag> I think that way the maps would probably be more memorable
