2012-02-26T12:04:59  <amstan> idk what dfu is
2012-02-26T12:05:16  <mcstar> some utility that lets you umpload firmwares
2012-02-26T12:05:18  <mcstar> to what
2012-02-26T12:05:28  <amstan> iphone?
2012-02-26T12:05:41  <mcstar> no, just some arduino pcb
2012-02-26T12:06:04  <amstan> never heard of dfu related to arduino
2012-02-26T12:06:11  <mcstar> so, this is my first aquaintance with a microcontroller
2012-02-26T12:06:16  <amstan> cool
2012-02-26T12:06:23  <amstan> did you get parts as well?
2012-02-26T12:06:36  <amstan> they're rather boring without anything else connected to them
2012-02-26T12:06:37  <mcstar> i didnt build this
2012-02-26T12:06:42  <amstan> unless you have some onboard stuff
2012-02-26T12:06:57  <mcstar> it controlls an etching machine
2012-02-26T12:07:07  <amstan> oh, ok
2012-02-26T12:07:09  <mcstar> chemical etching on a given temperature
2012-02-26T12:07:29  <mcstar> so this board keeps the temperature constant and controlls the process
2012-02-26T12:07:42  <mcstar> and i have to write a gui for it
2012-02-26T12:07:44  <mcstar> in qt
2012-02-26T12:07:54  <amstan> ok, cool
2012-02-26T12:08:49  <mcstar> i just tried out the boost asio framework
2012-02-26T12:08:57  <mcstar> seems to work so far
