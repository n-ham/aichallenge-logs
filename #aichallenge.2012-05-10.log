2012-05-10T09:15:01  <amstan> idk, for another department
2012-05-10T09:15:29  <amstan> that's a lot of missiles! http://nationalpostnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/fo0505_nuclearweaponsw25001.gif
2012-05-10T09:16:54  <mcstar> im sure the missiles are not to scale
2012-05-10T09:18:48  <amstan> the ones on the outside are bunched up, so there's even more of them
2012-05-10T09:21:29  <mcstar> hm
2012-05-10T09:21:36  <mcstar> it is not exactly slow
2012-05-10T09:22:11  <mcstar> 2.4M file of words, checked every word in couple of minutes in the interpreter
2012-05-10T09:22:26  <mcstar> (compiled to bytecode)
2012-05-10T09:22:41  <mcstar> minutes->seconds
2012-05-10T09:22:47  <mcstar> fail
2012-05-10T09:22:59  <mcstar> mleise: are you there?
2012-05-10T09:23:09  <amstan> couple of seconds for 2.4M, that seems right
2012-05-10T09:23:17  <amstan> if you're doing O(n) searches for each word
2012-05-10T09:23:35  <mleise> mcstar: yes, I'm here
2012-05-10T09:23:47  <mcstar> mleise: you did a prefix tree some time ago right?
2012-05-10T09:24:08  <mcstar> trie
2012-05-10T09:24:47  <mleise> yes I did. A pretty simple one
2012-05-10T09:24:59  <mcstar> http://hpaste.org/68330
2012-05-10T09:25:09  <mcstar> this is fully immutable/functional
2012-05-10T09:25:15  <mcstar> this is a simple one too
2012-05-10T09:25:39  <mcstar> i found a problem, which is solved with the help of a prefix tree, so i thought id do one
2012-05-10T09:27:22  <mcstar> mleise: can you paster yours?
2012-05-10T09:27:24  <mcstar> -r
2012-05-10T09:31:18  <mleise> k one moment....
2012-05-10T09:32:09  <mleise> http://codepad.org/C1OAhXD6
2012-05-10T09:32:35  <mleise> It has grown some features like returning the length of a match in addition to the data, or reverse lookups
2012-05-10T09:34:35  <mcstar> mleise: there is not much point in measuring lookup performance
2012-05-10T09:34:54  <mcstar> i mean that ofc should be fast
2012-05-10T09:35:05  <mcstar> but you need to consider allocations
2012-05-10T09:35:29  <mcstar> maybe a repreted fill-up test would be better
2012-05-10T09:35:34  <mcstar> repated*
2012-05-10T09:35:36  <mcstar> f
2012-05-10T09:35:59  <mleise> mcstar: ok, i have to admit, that my tree was used as a 'constant'
2012-05-10T09:36:22  <mleise> For a parser I filled it up once at program launch and then only read it
2012-05-10T09:37:07  <mcstar> i fear it will beat hands down my immutable one
2012-05-10T09:37:09  <mleise> It allocates 256 * pointer_size + data_size for every node
2012-05-10T09:37:15  <mcstar> too bad i cant test your code
2012-05-10T09:37:21  <mcstar> wait, i can
2012-05-10T09:38:34  <mcstar> are you busy?
2012-05-10T09:39:03  <mcstar> (damn, i shouldnt be doing this, but now im curious about a benchmark)
2012-05-10T09:39:42  <mcstar> i dont even know how to read some file in in D :S
2012-05-10T09:41:04  <mcstar> why cant you program in some proper language
2012-05-10T09:49:51  <mleise> mcstar: Now I am not busy any more
2012-05-10T09:49:58  <mcstar> great
2012-05-10T09:51:39  <mleise> you can just "read(file);"
2012-05-10T09:53:02  <mleise> that would be an array of bytes
2012-05-10T09:54:12  <mcstar> how about while(line=file.getline()){}
2012-05-10T09:56:21  <mleise> ok that would be: 	auto f = File("filename.txt"); foreach (ref line; f.byLine()) { writeln(line); }
2012-05-10T09:56:54  <mleise> (file closed when the scope exits)
2012-05-10T09:58:15  <mcstar> mleise: how does a main look like?
2012-05-10T09:58:25  <mcstar> wait, ill check your asteroids
2012-05-10T09:58:31  <mleise> depends on how much you need: void main() {}
2012-05-10T09:58:54  <mleise> up to int main(string[]) { return 0; }
2012-05-10T09:59:09  <mleise> int main(string[] args) { return 0; }
2012-05-10T09:59:44  <mcstar> mleise: ok, and now some timer code
2012-05-10T09:59:50  <mcstar> XD
2012-05-10T10:00:05  <mleise> well there is "benchmark" in std.datetime
2012-05-10T10:00:15  <mleise> it times a parameterless function
2012-05-10T10:00:23  <mleise> or two or three ...
2012-05-10T10:02:35  <mleise> 	auto results = benchmark!(foo, bar)(1_000_000);  // 1 million calls
2012-05-10T10:02:35  <mleise> 	writefln("foo() took: %s ms", results[0].msecs);
2012-05-10T10:02:35  <mleise> 	writefln("bar() took: %s ms", results[1].msecs);
2012-05-10T10:02:51  <mleise> mcstar: ^
2012-05-10T10:02:53  <mcstar> import std.datetime?
2012-05-10T10:02:56  <mleise> yes
2012-05-10T10:04:08  <mcstar> mleise: now i need to create your Trie and insert elements
2012-05-10T10:06:42  <mcstar> i guess your trie works for 'string' ?
2012-05-10T10:06:56  <mleise> yes. the key is always a string
2012-05-10T10:07:05  <mleise> and the data can be anything
2012-05-10T10:07:39  <mcstar> data?
2012-05-10T10:07:52  <mcstar> i just want to store the strings
2012-05-10T10:07:55  <mleise> My trie is used to re-trie-ve data
2012-05-10T10:08:08  <mcstar> i dont want that
2012-05-10T10:08:14  <mleise> Trie!string trie; trie["abc"] = "the data";
2012-05-10T10:08:15  <mcstar> hwo do i instantiate?
2012-05-10T10:08:26  <mcstar> Trie(bool) trie;
2012-05-10T10:08:29  <mcstar> ?
2012-05-10T10:08:37  <mleise> yes, that's what you want: Trie!bool
2012-05-10T10:08:42  <mleise> I use that often myself
2012-05-10T10:09:13  <mleise> or Trie!(bool). The () are optional in such cases
2012-05-10T10:11:01  <mcstar> mleise: cannot implicitely convert char[] to string
2012-05-10T10:11:20  <mcstar> i need to make a string from 'line'
2012-05-10T10:11:39  <mcstar> i doesnt have the '\n' in it right?
2012-05-10T10:12:11  <mleise> no, not by default
2012-05-10T10:12:19  <mleise> and it *is* a string already
2012-05-10T10:12:48  <mcstar> mleise: marco.d(197): Error: function marco.Trie!(bool).Trie.opIndexAssign (bool item, string key) is not callable using argument types (bool,char[])
2012-05-10T10:12:51  <mcstar> marco.d(197): Error: cannot implicitly convert expression (line) of type char[] to string
2012-05-10T10:14:48  <mleise> so it is not immutable, maybe a direct view of the file buffer :D. Use "line.idup" to make an immutable copy
2012-05-10T10:15:09  <mleise> a string is actually an alias for immutable(char)[]
2012-05-10T10:17:12  <mcstar> well its slow
2012-05-10T10:17:29  <mcstar> maybe im messing up something
2012-05-10T10:17:35  <mcstar> the haskell one runs in 2.1 secs
2012-05-10T10:17:51  <mcstar> ^C
2012-05-10T10:20:24  <mleise> I don't know what you are doing, but as I said, it was made for lookup of tokens in a parser. If you mostly add long strings it will suck. Lookup should be amazingly fast though
2012-05-10T10:20:48  <mcstar> it is still loading the file
2012-05-10T10:20:55  <mleise> Oo
2012-05-10T10:21:16  <mleise> lol, you will run out of memory
2012-05-10T10:21:24  <mleise> better keep an eye on that
2012-05-10T10:21:25  <mcstar> why?

2012-05-10T10:21:42  <mcstar> lol
2012-05-10T10:21:44  <mleise> if it is still loading it must be a huge file
2012-05-10T10:21:45  <mcstar> thats 3gb
2012-05-10T10:21:52  <mcstar> 2.4MegaBytes
2012-05-10T10:22:05  <mleise> so I just turned 2.4 MB into 3 GB??

2012-05-10T10:24:11  <mleise> btw, which compiler options did you use?
2012-05-10T10:24:13  <mcstar> only from ! to ~
2012-05-10T10:24:20  <mcstar> dmd -O marco.d
2012-05-10T10:24:46  <mleise> ok, if GDC is not at hand use at least "dmd -O -release -inline"
2012-05-10T10:25:29  <mleise> and you could theoretically cut the static array @ '~'
2012-05-10T10:25:51  <mcstar> mleise: i doubled approximately the charset, now it is form 0 to 255, minimal impact
2012-05-10T10:26:38  <mcstar> mleise: great, it allocates way faster this way
2012-05-10T10:26:50  <mleise> but the impact on my implementation is probably bigger :) Try Trie[127] nodes;
2012-05-10T10:26:59  <mcstar> no
2012-05-10T10:27:06  <mleise> ok
2012-05-10T10:27:06  <mcstar> this benchmark is convincing
2012-05-10T10:28:00  <mleise> It says: Don't allocate like a maniac in D
2012-05-10T10:28:11  <mcstar> mleise: if you give me cpu time function and tell me how to check membership, ill try a re-read benchmark too
2012-05-10T10:28:49  <mcstar> (benchmark is no good, i dont want to make functions and pass arguments to measure)
2012-05-10T10:28:54  <mleise> CPU time function? Use Posix stuff. Checking membership? what's that?
2012-05-10T10:29:16  <mcstar> trie["somestring"] == !null
2012-05-10T10:29:35  <mcstar> im not sure what the compiler will say
2012-05-10T10:29:52  <mleise> why not if(trie["something"]) ?
2012-05-10T10:30:02  <mcstar> thats good
2012-05-10T10:30:11  <mleise> after all you put bools into it
2012-05-10T10:30:16  <mcstar> i wasnt sure what happends if the stringis not in the trie
2012-05-10T10:30:21  <mcstar> gives false?
2012-05-10T10:30:23  <mcstar> (why would it?)
2012-05-10T10:30:32  <mleise> yes, it returns the default for that data type
2012-05-10T10:30:37  <mcstar> bleh
2012-05-10T10:30:40  <mcstar> ok
2012-05-10T10:30:56  <mcstar> import Posix.clock()?
2012-05-10T10:30:56  <mleise> i was cheating a little ;) no "maybe"
2012-05-10T10:32:13  <mcstar> i feel like being caged
2012-05-10T10:32:24  <mcstar> wheres the documentation?
2012-05-10T10:33:42  <mleise> I don't know which posix function it was, but I declared one myself when I needed the memory footprint
2012-05-10T10:33:45  <mleise> getrusage
2012-05-10T10:34:23  <mcstar> ah and now comes the other problem
2012-05-10T10:34:29  <mcstar> in my haskell code, the words are in a list
2012-05-10T10:34:36  <mcstar> but here i just read it into the trie
2012-05-10T10:34:46  <mcstar> so i cant check for them
2012-05-10T10:35:01  <mleise> http://codepad.org/w4ROIeXG
2012-05-10T10:35:24  <mleise> what do you want to check?
2012-05-10T10:35:40  <mcstar> mleise: http://sprunge.us/NMfX
2012-05-10T10:35:48  <mcstar> can you pls extend this?
2012-05-10T10:35:54  <mcstar> i suck at D obviously
2012-05-10T10:36:00  <mcstar> read the file into an array
2012-05-10T10:36:16  <mcstar> and add a loop for cheking whether it is in the trie
2012-05-10T10:36:34  <mcstar> and 2 time interval measurements
2012-05-10T10:36:43  <mleise> wut?
2012-05-10T10:36:43  <mcstar> 1 for the reading, 1 for the checking
2012-05-10T10:36:47  <mleise> ok
2012-05-10T10:36:59  <mleise> why the extra array?
2012-05-10T10:37:27  <mleise> and when would i add the array items into the trie?
2012-05-10T10:38:22  <mcstar> read the lines into an array
2012-05-10T10:38:31  <mcstar> so that you can check them after you added them all
2012-05-10T10:38:41  <mcstar> you dont want to re-read them from the file
2012-05-10T10:38:48  <mcstar> or use a list
2012-05-10T10:38:52  <mcstar> thats good too
2012-05-10T10:39:30  <mcstar> you add them to the array when you read them and add them to the trie
2012-05-10T10:40:23  <mleise> ok, and then I loop over all the items in the list and try to find them in the try. sounds simple
2012-05-10T10:40:47  <mcstar> yeah

2012-05-10T10:54:54  <mcstar> what about them?
2012-05-10T10:55:56  <mcstar> mleise: you have to admit its nice how the haskell one fits into 30 lines
2012-05-10T10:58:04  <mleise> yes it is nice :)
2012-05-10T10:58:21  <mcstar> mleise: if you want to try it, put my first paste into PrefixTrie.hs, and http://sprunge.us/jRUN into test.hs
2012-05-10T11:00:22  <mleise> does the words file have duplicate entries?
2012-05-10T11:00:32  <mcstar> i dont think so

2012-05-10T11:12:00  <mcstar> halfed  the key space, but get more hits re-reading?
2012-05-10T11:12:20  <mleise> I get more than half the line number in hits
2012-05-10T11:12:42  <mleise> like 120000 of 200000
2012-05-10T11:13:38  <mcstar> 121069 instead of 109576
2012-05-10T11:13:59  <mcstar> mleise: but the load time is significantly better!

2012-05-10T11:17:41  <mleise> I left out half the words ?!
2012-05-10T11:17:58  <mcstar> 150/2=75 -> 15?
2012-05-10T11:18:00  <mleise> to get a mix of existing and non-existing entries for the lookip
2012-05-10T11:18:19  <mleise> I don't know ... maybe the garbage collector struggles more when more ram is used
2012-05-10T11:18:30  <mcstar> you didnt change your trie?
2012-05-10T11:19:26  <mleise> I just made it 127 entries long
2012-05-10T11:19:42  <mcstar> 219153/2. equals 109577. according to my Mathematica, now WTF is going on!!!???
2012-05-10T11:19:42  <mleise> and look at this: 63%    ulong gc.gcx.Gcx.fullcollect(void*)
2012-05-10T11:20:14  <mleise> what does your PrefixTrie return?
2012-05-10T11:20:28  <mcstar> True
2012-05-10T11:20:29  <mleise> the words are all unique according to sort -u | wc -l
2012-05-10T11:20:48  <mleise> how about: I found x matches?
2012-05-10T11:20:51  <mcstar> ah sorry
2012-05-10T11:21:00  <mcstar> PrefixTrie doesnt return anythng
2012-05-10T11:21:03  <mcstar> its a data type
2012-05-10T11:21:22  <mcstar> but the test code returns the last result, which will be true
2012-05-10T11:21:27  <mcstar> and all are found btw
2012-05-10T11:21:35  <mcstar> but i can change it to all
2012-05-10T11:21:37  <mcstar> 'all'
2012-05-10T11:21:53  <mleise> add only every second word to the prefixtrie

2012-05-10T11:36:44  <mleise> thus some non-existing entries got counted anyway. That's what I have the matchAllOrNothing method in the original code

2012-05-10T12:13:10  <mleise> hehe, poor Haskell
2012-05-10T12:13:39  <mcstar> well, poor or not, it made you change your code(which was broken)
2012-05-10T12:13:56  <mcstar> mleise: can it handle all words now?
2012-05-10T12:14:26  <mleise> I used the matchallOrNothing routine in [] now, if that's what you mean
2012-05-10T12:14:32  <mcstar> i dont really understand why is the memory requirement is suddenly lower
2012-05-10T12:14:33  <mleise> so it returns full matches only
2012-05-10T12:14:46  <mcstar> no i mean loading all the words form the file
2012-05-10T12:15:05  <mleise> no it still only loads half of them
2012-05-10T12:15:18  <mleise> calloc doesn't allocate physical memory until you write to it
2012-05-10T12:15:32  <mleise> (on a 4KB memory page granularity)
2012-05-10T12:15:51  <mcstar> mleise: i know it loads half of them, it prints it
2012-05-10T12:15:59  <mcstar> im asking COULD it handle all of them
2012-05-10T12:16:01  <mcstar> and i guess yes
2012-05-10T12:16:39  <mleise> oh ok :D
2012-05-10T12:16:46  <mcstar> mleise: why would calloc explain this?
2012-05-10T12:17:03  <mcstar> it must allocate a whole 256 element array when you write to one of its element
2012-05-10T12:17:16  <mcstar> or 127 or something
2012-05-10T12:17:23  <mleise> the answer is yes, it uses 650 MB
2012-05-10T12:17:46  <mleise> I optimized the array size to '~' - '!' + 1 ;)
2012-05-10T12:17:53  <mcstar> ill change back to 256 and load every word
2012-05-10T12:18:06  <mleise> uh oh...

2012-05-10T12:23:36  <mleise> no the destructor calls add up

2012-05-10T12:36:28  <mcstar> mleise: i think you tweaked your code, to return true immediately, whatever the query is
2012-05-10T12:36:44  <mcstar> that would explain the speed
2012-05-10T12:37:03  <mleise> ok, I'll upload a fixed version with 256 nodes and all words
2012-05-10T12:37:23  <mleise> but I don't like the loading times that will result from it ;)
2012-05-10T12:37:30  <thestinger> so add every other word
2012-05-10T12:37:33  <thestinger> but do a lookup for each
2012-05-10T12:37:41  <thestinger> to verify that mcstar is wrong :P
2012-05-10T12:37:57  <mcstar> mleise: nono i measured that
2012-05-10T12:38:00  <mcstar> its ok
2012-05-10T12:38:12  <mcstar> mleise: problem is i cant read your code :(
2012-05-10T12:38:26  <mcstar> and i made that funny explanation to explain the speed
2012-05-10T12:39:35  <mleise> there is some inlining going on, no question
2012-05-10T12:39:45  <mleise> the [] method isn't actually 'called'
2012-05-10T12:40:15  <mcstar> mleise: can yo explain this? http://pastebin.com/zqqyBgMR
2012-05-10T12:41:21  <thestinger> mleise: how are you doing it without a marker on each node? to make the terminal ones
2012-05-10T12:41:40  <mcstar> thestinger: seen my code?
2012-05-10T12:41:51  <thestinger> oh, data?
2012-05-10T12:41:57  <thestinger> what does data hold? the whole value?
2012-05-10T12:42:34  <mcstar> i just dont see how his code walks the tree
2012-05-10T12:42:39  <mleise> a marker on each node?
2012-05-10T12:42:42  <mcstar> i see an oracle
2012-05-10T12:42:52  <thestinger> ["cat", "catacomb"]
2012-05-10T12:42:54  <mleise> hehe maybe it is, I like delphi
2012-05-10T12:43:04  <thestinger> c -> a -> [t] -> a -> c -> o -> m -> [b]
2012-05-10T12:43:34  <mleise> I just exit when I find no pointer to the next node
2012-05-10T12:46:01  <mcstar> thestinger: this is the representation of ["cat", "catacomb"] http://pastebin.com/rDvX6DDQ
2012-05-10T12:46:24  <mcstar> (by deriving Show)
2012-05-10T12:46:26  <mcstar> nice innit?
2012-05-10T12:48:42  <mleise> I certainly mixed payload and terminal node status
2012-05-10T12:49:03  <thestinger> is it a set or a map?
2012-05-10T12:49:41  <thestinger> for my map trie I used boost::optional (Maybe in haskell)
2012-05-10T12:49:45  <thestinger> for the set I just used a bool
2012-05-10T12:50:10  <thestinger> let me just delete the irrelevant stuff like the iterators and erase method
2012-05-10T12:50:18  <mleise> corrected version: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62255329/trie.zip
2012-05-10T12:50:35  <mleise> have fun
2012-05-10T12:51:05  <mcstar> thestinger: what is a set or a map?
2012-05-10T12:51:43  <thestinger> the trie
2012-05-10T12:51:47  <thestinger> I don't understand what node.data is
2012-05-10T12:51:47  <mcstar> mleise: so you are storing the pointers to the read-in strings in the trie?
2012-05-10T12:52:00  <mleise> what? no!
2012-05-10T12:52:18  <mleise> I store pointers to the trie-nodes containing the next character to look up
2012-05-10T12:52:32  <thestinger> what's the data member for?
2012-05-10T12:52:42  <mleise> data == payload
2012-05-10T12:53:01  <mcstar> then what is nodes?
2012-05-10T12:53:03  <thestinger> so it's a map of string->value?
2012-05-10T12:53:09  <thestinger> or it's just the string?
2012-05-10T12:53:12  <mleise> If the string is "r" I start at the root node and see if the 'r'th entry exists (pointer to it is not null)
2012-05-10T12:53:31  <mleise> the 'r'th entry in the nodes array
2012-05-10T12:53:44  <mleise> It has 256 entries to cover every possible byte value
2012-05-10T12:54:35  <mcstar> f (node is null) return data;
2012-05-10T12:54:38  <mcstar> if (node is null) return data;
2012-05-10T12:54:38  <mleise> so 'r' is -> nodes[114]
2012-05-10T12:54:40  <mcstar> why?
2012-05-10T12:55:30  <mleise> hacking. remember I return the default value 0 if an entry isn't there?
2012-05-10T12:55:36  <mleise> that's what happens here
2012-05-10T12:55:48  <mleise> I assume the data at this point to be the default
2012-05-10T12:55:57  <mcstar> mleise: im losing imperative code-ground :(
2012-05-10T12:56:32  <mleise> I could have written return false;
2012-05-10T12:56:53  <mleise> hey, maybe that's faster
2012-05-10T12:57:49  <mleise> yes it is !!! thanks
2012-05-10T12:58:14  <thestinger> I'll make it non-templated too so it doesn't need boost::array :P
2012-05-10T12:58:37  <thestinger> std::array doesn't work with incomplete types
2012-05-10T12:58:51  <thestinger> it actually did with gcc 4.6 but now it yells at you
2012-05-10T12:59:52  <mleise> mcstar: That return data was actually needed when I returned something for "a" in "abcdef"
2012-05-10T13:00:07  <mleise> but now that I match the whole string I can just return false there
2012-05-10T13:00:20  <mcstar> great
2012-05-10T13:00:30  <mcstar> why the hell is my lookup so slow
2012-05-10T13:00:43  <thestinger> mcstar: how are you storing the children?
2012-05-10T13:00:51  <rwest> thestinger: in cages
2012-05-10T13:00:56  <thestinger> anyway I'll be back in a bit :P
2012-05-10T13:01:09  <mcstar> thestinger: http://hpaste.org/68330
2012-05-10T13:01:13  <mcstar> rwest: your children
2012-05-10T13:01:25  <mcstar> they want daddy
2012-05-10T13:01:52  <rwest> If I have children, nobody has told me
2012-05-10T13:02:05  <mcstar> rwest: you were too drunk to remember
2012-05-10T13:02:08  <mcstar> XD
2012-05-10T13:02:26  <mleise> even faster version (yay!): http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62255329/trie.zip
2012-05-10T13:02:50  <mcstar> mleise: my problem is, that it seem to add the items real fast(<4s), but takes 16seconds to check them?
2012-05-10T13:02:51  <mleise> lol what's going on here
2012-05-10T13:03:08  <mleise> mcstar: I speak no haskell
2012-05-10T13:03:35  <mleise> With these high level languages it is always difficult to figure out what they do under the hood
2012-05-10T13:03:37  <mcstar> akkor probald meg ezt, most jobb?
2012-05-10T13:03:46  <mleise> yes, that!
2012-05-10T13:04:07  <mcstar> mleise: i could go and profile...
2012-05-10T13:04:16  <mcstar> but instead im just gonna stare at it real mean
2012-05-10T13:05:00  <mleise> hey, you still cheat with upper and lower bounds!
2012-05-10T13:05:10  <mcstar> thats the first paste
2012-05-10T13:05:43  <mcstar> (im not going to repaste for 2 character change)
2012-05-10T13:06:32  <mleise> :p
2012-05-10T13:07:43  <mleise> Well I guess, you can't really make it faster in ideomatic Haskell code
2012-05-10T13:07:57  <mcstar> not so sure
2012-05-10T13:08:00  <mleise> Like I had to use calloc, to get the loading time improvement
2012-05-10T13:08:46  <mcstar> i could preallocate in a huge vector, and just use chunks from that
2012-05-10T13:08:51  <mcstar> -in
2012-05-10T13:09:10  <mcstar> or really use the State monad, and have steful updates
2012-05-10T13:09:14  <mcstar> or whatever
2012-05-10T13:09:18  <mcstar> there are options
2012-05-10T13:09:28  <mcstar> mleise: im very much a newbie to haskell
2012-05-10T13:12:35  <mleise> sounds complicated :-/
2012-05-10T13:23:22  <mleise> what the ...
2012-05-10T13:23:26  <mleise> this is surreal
2012-05-10T13:23:36  <mleise> it must be... wrong
2012-05-10T13:24:19  <mcstar> what?
2012-05-10T13:25:10  <mleise> no it was a bug
2012-05-10T13:30:09  <antimatroid> you're all always here in the middle of the night :(
2012-05-10T13:31:25  <mcstar> depends on where you are
2012-05-10T13:31:32  <mcstar> time is relative

2012-05-10T13:43:41  <mcstar> probably lookups are fast, but it is generating the trie just before that
2012-05-10T13:44:42  <mleise> oh that's bad
2012-05-10T13:44:55  <mleise> can you materialize the trie somehow?
2012-05-10T13:45:32  <mcstar> http://i.imgur.com/vaiKZ.png
2012-05-10T13:45:36  <mcstar> that wont help
2012-05-10T13:45:45  <mcstar> it would still be slower overall than yours
2012-05-10T13:45:54  <mcstar> but i can measure lookup a second time
2012-05-10T13:46:55  <mleise> well, the lookup is 200 times slower than mine. there must be something you can do
2012-05-10T13:47:19  <mcstar> how did you measure that?
2012-05-10T13:47:27  <mcstar> i dont know how much time the lookup takes
2012-05-10T13:47:29  <mleise> you said 16 seconds?
2012-05-10T13:47:37  <mcstar> correction now i do
2012-05-10T13:47:45  <mcstar> checking took 0.197 sec
2012-05-10T13:47:49  <mleise> ah
2012-05-10T13:47:55  <mcstar> 16 for the first time
2012-05-10T13:48:00  <mleise> that's much much saner
2012-05-10T13:48:01  <mcstar> but it isnt pure lookup
2012-05-10T13:48:08  <mcstar> i think you get it
2012-05-10T13:50:59  <mcstar> mleise: this actually has a benefit, in a real application, it might happen that you dont look up every key, so this way you can save memory
