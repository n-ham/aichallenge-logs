2011-07-08T08:04:20  <antimatroid> hey
2011-07-08T08:04:27  <sir_macelon> seems again workers are down and beta is not playing any games for 5 hours now...
2011-07-08T08:05:38  <antimatroid> :(
2011-07-08T08:06:51  <sir_macelon> and I don't see any progress over any of the 5 issues for the launch milestone...
2011-07-08T08:06:51  <mcstar> im gonna kill myself...
2011-07-08T08:07:34  <mcstar> i have more pressing problems
2011-07-08T08:07:53  <mcstar> my linux just hang for the second time in 2 weeks
2011-07-08T08:09:19  <mcstar> wait a minute, hang hung hung?
2011-07-08T08:09:26  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-08T08:09:34  <mcstar> just hung, right antimatroid M
2011-07-08T08:09:36  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-08T08:09:42  <antimatroid> what did it do?
2011-07-08T08:09:46  <antimatroid> just freeze up?
2011-07-08T08:09:50  <mcstar> yep
2011-07-08T08:09:54  <antimatroid> mine does that if i am using too much memory
2011-07-08T08:10:06  <antimatroid> i have to be careful to close my browser windows every few days, it sucks
2011-07-08T08:10:14  <antimatroid> that and paint are my only complaints about linux
2011-07-08T08:10:27  <mcstar> no, if that was the case, it would start swapping, which is noisy, and its not unresponsive when it does that
2011-07-08T08:10:37  <rabidus> what browser do you use
2011-07-08T08:10:43  <mcstar> it just freeze
2011-07-08T08:10:48  <mcstar> when i was compiling
2011-07-08T08:11:18  <mcstar> rabidus: it cannot be the browsers fault, and i usually have 3 gb free ram
2011-07-08T08:11:31  <smiley1983> mcstar: does it run xscreensaver? and does it pass memtest?
2011-07-08T08:11:48  <smiley1983> xscreensaver is the most reliable way to crash linux I've found
2011-07-08T08:12:02  <smiley1983> the other one being the use of dodgy hardware
2011-07-08T08:12:39  <mcstar> smiley1983: my first guess i faulty memory, ill check with memtest
2011-07-08T08:12:48  <mcstar> but it can be a kernel/cpu problem too
2011-07-08T08:12:56  <mcstar> xscreensaver never crashed my box
2011-07-08T08:12:59  <rabidus> or then: something else
2011-07-08T08:13:46  <mcstar> hell, im not sure i have memtest as an option
2011-07-08T08:13:55  <mcstar> i use grub2 with gpt
2011-07-08T08:14:04  <mcstar> and i didnt configure it to have memtest
2011-07-08T08:14:10  <smiley1983> ubuntu install discs have the option built in
2011-07-08T08:14:17  <smiley1983> if you have one of those lying around
2011-07-08T08:14:24  <mcstar> i dont use optical drives :)
2011-07-08T08:14:32  <smiley1983> they can be transferred to USB
2011-07-08T08:14:44  <mcstar> but i might have a pendrive lying around
2011-07-08T08:15:05  <smiley1983> though because Ubuntu is silly, it needs special software to do the transfer (unlike the superior Arch isos)
2011-07-08T08:15:15  <mcstar> oh, my 4gb pendrive actually has win7 installer on it
2011-07-08T08:15:35  <mcstar> smiley1983: youre an archer too?
2011-07-08T08:15:42  <smiley1983> yes :)
2011-07-08T08:15:56  <smiley1983> I was a Debian user until I discovered Arch
2011-07-08T08:16:03  <mcstar> ok, there are 3 confirmed arch cases on this channel
2011-07-08T08:16:12  <mcstar> its spreading
2011-07-08T08:16:33  <smiley1983> who is the other one?
2011-07-08T08:16:38  <mcstar> debian/suse/kubuntu/arch
2011-07-08T08:16:48  <mcstar> jm-carthur
2011-07-08T08:16:57  <mcstar> (i dont want to wake him)
2011-07-08T08:17:21  <smiley1983> right. It makes sense that people will migrate to Arch, though, because it's so great :)
2011-07-08T08:18:16  <smiley1983> there's no TCP server or working server code at the moment, is there?
2011-07-08T08:18:28  <mcstar> my highlights are: good packaging(modularity), easy build system(abs,aur) and bsd style init scripts
2011-07-08T08:18:48  <mcstar> oh, and rolling release style
2011-07-08T08:19:02  <mcstar> there was one, from berak
2011-07-08T08:19:10  <mcstar> but i didnt see him in quite a while
2011-07-08T08:19:34  <mcstar> berak pulled mcleo's tcp server
2011-07-08T08:19:59  <mcstar> but there was talk to add couple of functions to the engine's sandbox, so that it could function as a tcp server
2011-07-08T08:20:31  <mcstar> smiley1983: and arch has the nicest wiki
2011-07-08T08:20:42  <smiley1983> When the test server was running, though, it wasn't telling me about water, so I think it's still incomplete
2011-07-08T08:23:10  <smiley1983> yes, all the things you've mentioned about Arch are great. I was surprised at first by how stable everything is considering the rolling release model.
2011-07-08T08:23:41  <mcstar> memtest added to grub
2011-07-08T08:23:45  <mcstar> im gonna reboot

2011-07-08T08:55:44  <smiley1983> rabidus: do you know if there's a TCP server now?
2011-07-08T08:55:52  <rabidus> no, i don't know
2011-07-08T08:56:47  <smiley1983> oh well, I'm guessing it will probably become a higher priority once the contest starts
2011-07-08T08:57:11  <rabidus> me too
2011-07-08T08:57:35  <antimatroid> i'm not sure anyone's even working on a tcp server
2011-07-08T08:57:41  <antimatroid> i suspect mcleopold is busy with other stuff?
2011-07-08T08:57:54  <rabidus> he is slacking
2011-07-08T08:57:55  <rabidus> :D
2011-07-08T08:58:09  <antimatroid> he's done more than you :P
2011-07-08T08:58:18  <antimatroid> (And i)
2011-07-08T08:58:23  <rabidus> yeah, well i'm a huge slacker
2011-07-08T08:58:41  <rabidus> isn't that common thing with programmers?
2011-07-08T08:58:59  <rabidus> if you are not coding, then you are thinking (slacking really)
2011-07-08T08:59:00  <antimatroid> with people*
2011-07-08T08:59:14  <antimatroid> i wouldn't have a clue how to set up tcp stuff
2011-07-08T08:59:22  <rabidus> me neither
2011-07-08T08:59:33  <rabidus> but great idea overall
2011-07-08T08:59:46  <rabidus> awesome actually
2011-07-08T09:00:17  <rabidus> it would be fun if every game would leave a tcp server behind, and contest goes on over there after it 'offically' ends
2011-07-08T09:00:24  <rabidus> like there is now pw tcp server
2011-07-08T09:01:41  <rabidus> tcp server doesn't need that much resources to run
2011-07-08T09:01:50  <rabidus> just talks to clients and check that data is valid
2011-07-08T09:01:59  <rabidus> very straightforward

2011-07-08T09:23:28  <antimatroid> possibly with some new ones
2011-07-08T09:23:44  <antimatroid> the vision is like an ai training ground i think, at least that's what I envision

2011-07-08T09:24:54  <bhasker> i felt planetwars was more of an interesting challenge
2011-07-08T09:25:06  <antimatroid> than tron?
2011-07-08T09:25:10  <bhasker> than ants
2011-07-08T09:25:14  <bhasker> i feel*
2011-07-08T09:25:15  <bhasker> rather
2011-07-08T09:25:38  <antimatroid> i've stated my opinion on this a few times, i think planet wars was a more interesting problem, but ants offers more in the way of ai
2011-07-08T09:25:46  <antimatroid> in that there's more obvious things to work on and see clear results from

2011-07-08T09:28:11  <rabidus> with zeta? what do you mean?

2011-07-08T09:28:53  <antimatroid> rabidus: the current "framework" is being developed under the name epsilon, there is plans for a future one completely rewritten called zeta, which would provide a framework for multiple contests etc.
2011-07-08T09:29:10  <rabidus> mmh.. very nice
2011-07-08T09:29:25  <antimatroid> as to how long that will take if it ever happens, we will see, i hope it does happen
2011-07-08T09:29:32  <antimatroid> we intent to do it at least :)
2011-07-08T09:29:38  <rabidus> then there can be like .. poker games or .. chess or something similar with zeta framework ?
2011-07-08T09:29:38  <bhasker> yea thats what i felt, all the bots look the same right now
2011-07-08T09:29:43  <rabidus> very, very nice idea if that's so
2011-07-08T09:29:43  <bhasker> there doesn't seem to be much of a difference
2011-07-08T09:29:57  <bhasker> and more importantly the games look boring to watch
2011-07-08T09:30:02  <bhasker> planetwars was a lot more fun
2011-07-08T09:30:05  <bhasker> to watch
2011-07-08T09:30:12  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't like the flooded maps
2011-07-08T09:30:37  <antimatroid> i would prefer less ants on the map, but so far people seem to think it's been necessary for games not to take forever?
2011-07-08T09:30:45  <antimatroid> i wouldn't have thought it would make that much difference
2011-07-08T09:31:03  <antimatroid> so it was more strategic and you could actually see the game/battle unfold
2011-07-08T09:31:24  <antimatroid> but i don't know how much will vary strategy wise
2011-07-08T09:31:40  <antimatroid> battle code can vary, but how noticable will it be?
2011-07-08T09:33:18  <bhasker> yea battle code is rather simplistic
2011-07-08T09:33:30  <bhasker> and there is no incentive to control territory
2011-07-08T09:33:42  <bhasker> all ants are spreading out
2011-07-08T09:34:32  <bhasker> i think we should allow stacking
2011-07-08T09:34:38  <bhasker> that would change the game a lot
2011-07-08T09:35:06  <bhasker> you could have super squads that can't be blocked.
2011-07-08T09:35:29  <bhasker> though visualizing it might be harder

2011-07-08T09:42:40  <rabidus> stacked ants could also do wider range damage, so they can be larger on map
2011-07-08T09:43:23  <rabidus> that actually would change the entire game.
2011-07-08T09:43:32  <rabidus> i liked antimatroids version more
2011-07-08T09:44:28  <bhasker> the dmg distribution method?
2011-07-08T09:46:50  <rabidus> stacked ants and food into the nest
2011-07-08T09:47:29  <antimatroid> we should have done my original ants game :P :(
2011-07-08T09:47:33  <antimatroid> but alas, way too late
2011-07-08T09:48:30  <bhasker> heh

2011-07-08T09:48:48  <antimatroid> mine was like now, but you had to use a move to "attack" and adjacent ant, you had hp for ants, you could fuse your ants together and their hp would sum, you had home bases that you had to harvest and return food to to generate new ants, and you had to defend your base because if an enemy invaded it you died (like future cop lapd preccint assault)
2011-07-08T09:49:03  <antimatroid> and you had to use a move to harvest a single food item
2011-07-08T09:49:27  <rabidus> and why that idea was crushed?
2011-07-08T09:49:32  <antimatroid> "too complicated"
2011-07-08T09:49:56  <rabidus> well it is much more complicated than the ants game now, but... i think we need a bit more complexity
2011-07-08T09:50:28  <antimatroid> frontier made an awesome mock up visualiser for it too
2011-07-08T09:50:33  <rabidus> i liked a lot of that 'move harvested food into the nest if you want your son'
2011-07-08T09:50:37  <antimatroid> the ants were actual walking (animated) ants
2011-07-08T09:50:37  <rabidus> yeah, i saw that
2011-07-08T09:51:42  <antimatroid> with multiplayer, we could have given like 10+ points for taking out a queen/base and then the bot who lost the base couldn't generate more ants
2011-07-08T09:52:07  <antimatroid> or the bot who lost the base loses all their ants and the bot who took the base out gets that many points
2011-07-08T09:52:16  <bhasker> yea the current game is just too simple
2011-07-08T09:52:30  <rabidus> not too simple, but it is simple
2011-07-08T09:54:06  <antimatroid> i don't really see how battles are simple though?
2011-07-08T09:54:31  <antimatroid> i still hope that the best bot will be one that is somewhat offensive

2011-07-08T09:58:42  <bhasker> lets see
2011-07-08T09:58:49  <bhasker> most bots seem to be following a strat of
2011-07-08T09:58:58  <bhasker> don't enter battle as long as its an equal tradeoff
2011-07-08T09:59:07  <bhasker> they just seem to go back and forth till they have a majority
2011-07-08T09:59:08  <bhasker> and then fight
2011-07-08T10:06:21  <bhasker> i think ant spawning should be tuned too, maybe if it was made so that the bigger your ant cluster the more chances of attracting an ant to spawn would be nicer
2011-07-08T10:11:31  <bhasker> any ideas on how to do an efficient getNearbyAnts query
2011-07-08T10:11:57  <rabidus> sql?
2011-07-08T10:12:09  <bhasker> no i meant like in the bot
2011-07-08T10:12:19  <jmreardon> what data structure are you using atm?
2011-07-08T10:13:43  <bhasker> its crappy right now since ants are stored in a vector
2011-07-08T10:13:56  <bhasker> i am assumin gi can just search the grid
2011-07-08T10:14:01  <bhasker> in a square around the current position
2011-07-08T10:14:10  <bhasker> rather than do  a real distance calculation
2011-07-08T10:14:14  <bhasker> between all ants
2011-07-08T10:14:28  <bhasker> i am wondering if there was something better than can be done
2011-07-08T10:14:47  <bhasker> like maybe precompute it in one pass across the map for all ants
2011-07-08T10:14:54  <bhasker> rather for all squares
2011-07-08T10:14:55  <jmreardon> ya, right now I put all my ants in a 2d array of bools, keep a precalculated list of grid offsets, then add them to the point and query those array entries
2011-07-08T10:15:28  <bhasker> ah yea i was thinking of doing something similar
2011-07-08T10:15:38  <bhasker> i think those queries are killing my bots performance right now
2011-07-08T10:15:51  <jmreardon> my entire ai is actually being done by precalculating various values on the entire map
2011-07-08T10:15:57  <rabidus> nice
2011-07-08T10:15:59  <rabidus> > 100 skill
2011-07-08T10:16:06  <bhasker> which bot is it?
2011-07-08T10:16:12  <jmreardon> works fairly well, but it's hard to do things like make only one ant go after a food

2011-07-08T10:33:37  <mcstar> i think food spawning could be modified, so that you would have to collect 2 squares within lets say 10 turns, to get 1 ant

2011-07-08T11:17:38  <mcstar> take a look at this game
2011-07-08T11:18:11  <mcstar> my ants must have bribed the engine, otherwise i cant understand why did my bot win
2011-07-08T11:19:24  <VilleH> Haha, seems so :D
2011-07-08T11:20:14  <mcstar> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=67602&user=17
2011-07-08T11:20:18  <mcstar> another example
2011-07-08T11:20:40  <mcstar> when it wins, it wins the same way, with much fewer ants than other bots
2011-07-08T11:21:11  <mcstar> i left a few bugs in it, and it seems to be suicidal
2011-07-08T11:21:19  <mcstar> and still wins, i dont understand
2011-07-08T11:21:48  <mcstar> by suicidal i mean, frequently 2 or more of my ants step on each other..
2011-07-08T11:22:24  <VilleH> Yeah, my first bot did that also
2011-07-08T11:22:54  <mcstar> the problem is that its not my first :D
2011-07-08T11:24:23  <VilleH> Hehe, nice comeback on that last game from 4 vs 59 ants to victory :D

2011-07-08T11:25:18  <VilleH> I think you are winning with small amount of ants because the battle system is rewarding based on how much your ants are contributing to the killing of other ants
2011-07-08T11:25:45  <VilleH> Though your ants are getting beaten to death at the same time :)
2011-07-08T11:25:48  <mcstar> yeah, i wonder how much better it would be without the continuous suicides :(
2011-07-08T11:27:15  <VilleH> I wonder how my bot would do against any of the "real" bots on the server as it is currently beating those local bots all the time..
2011-07-08T11:27:43  <VilleH> as the c# or mono doesn't work on server I cant test them there
2011-07-08T11:28:58  <mcstar> too bad
2011-07-08T11:29:29  <mcstar> what can i say? experiment, find it out
2011-07-08T11:30:34  <VilleH> Yeah, I'm running my own bots against each other but hard to say if they are even close to what others have done..
2011-07-08T11:31:08  <eashoka> hi, anybody knows when would the server be up again ?
2011-07-08T11:31:49  <antimatroid> mcstar: remember you are likely collecting points when battling enemies
2011-07-08T11:32:24  <mcstar> antimatroid: ok, but the only thing that bot does well, is collecting food quite optimally
2011-07-08T11:32:28  <antimatroid> so even if you don't have the largest army, if you're churning through ants a lot faster it's possible for your score to be high
2011-07-08T11:32:38  <mcstar> and as i said, it dies often from its own fault
2011-07-08T11:32:49  <antimatroid> my bot is doing NOTHING in the way of battles
2011-07-08T11:32:54  <VilleH> Actually it seems that c# has started working again, now if the worker would be doing its work I could try it out
2011-07-08T11:32:54  <antimatroid> it's just churning through lots of ants
2011-07-08T11:33:01  <mcstar> antimatroid: mine neither
2011-07-08T11:33:11  <mcstar> absolutely has no idea about enemies :)
2011-07-08T11:33:20  <antimatroid> mine sents ants towards enemies
2011-07-08T11:33:35  <antimatroid> but it doesn't do it smartly, and will only do it if "it thinks it has enough ants"
2011-07-08T11:33:38  <antimatroid> but yeah
2011-07-08T11:34:03  <mcstar> antimatroid: cant you help VilleH ? youre cpp, youre closer to it then me
2011-07-08T11:34:14  <mcstar> (to c#)
2011-07-08T11:34:32  <antimatroid> what's the problem?
2011-07-08T11:34:38  <antimatroid> i've never done anything with c#
2011-07-08T11:34:59  <mcstar> i forgot, but he cant use it on the server

2011-07-08T13:06:07  <amstan> probably 10 seconds or something
2011-07-08T13:13:18  <sir_macelon> amstan: so maybe timeout is too short?
2011-07-08T13:13:36  <amstan> you really want to wait 10 seconds to get a reply for rankings?

2011-07-08T14:01:00  <sir_macelon> amstan: workers are still down, I thought you were going to start them again?
2011-07-08T14:01:31  <bhasker> sir_macelon your bot is quite interesting to watch
2011-07-08T14:02:07  <sir_macelon> amstan: It's nothing important, just if there is a simple solution we could use it, but if it is to complicated then we have to live with it during beta

2011-07-08T14:02:59  <contestbot> amstan: mcleopold was last seen in #aichallenge 4 days, 1 hour, 19 minutes, and 1 second ago: <McLeopold> in games per minute, that is
2011-07-08T14:03:10  <sir_macelon> bhasker: thanks, but it's still rather simple I think
2011-07-08T14:03:18  <amstan> not sure.. something seems broken
2011-07-08T14:03:41  <bhasker> well i think most bots are still simple, seem to be chase food, if nothing to do chase an ant, if still nothing explore
2011-07-08T14:04:05  <bhasker> or reverse the last two orders maybe
2011-07-08T14:04:43  <bhasker> the difference between bots seem to be, a) how fast they can explore b) not to die in suicide moves
2011-07-08T14:04:48  <mcstar> excuse me, my bot is rather complicated, it makes me tired to improve it
2011-07-08T14:05:13  <sir_macelon> people are still reluctant to implement any battling, because the final rules are not yet settled
2011-07-08T14:05:22  <a1k0n_> yeah when does the actual contest start?
2011-07-08T14:05:37  <sir_macelon> mcstar: you'd better start refactoring then :)
2011-07-08T14:05:48  <mcstar> yeah, constantly :D
2011-07-08T14:06:05  <sir_macelon> a1k0n_: I am asking the same question
2011-07-08T14:06:33  <sir_macelon> how long it was for the planet wars to launch?
2011-07-08T14:06:47  <sir_macelon> does anybody know, how long was the beta period there?
2011-07-08T14:08:55  <bhasker> though i wonder if the fog of war actually hampers smart bots or really smart strategies from evolving
2011-07-08T14:09:00  <a1k0n_> very short in comparison
2011-07-08T14:12:15  <sir_macelon> bhasker: it puts more pressure to exploration strategy and therefore some luck
2011-07-08T14:12:28  <bhasker> yea but its making every bot the same
2011-07-08T14:12:34  <bhasker> every bot is just spreading out
2011-07-08T14:12:41  <bhasker> also there doesn't seem to be any incentive in sticking together
2011-07-08T14:12:44  <bhasker> beyond combat
2011-07-08T14:13:02  <bhasker> so we don't see like any marching ants or any grand battles really
2011-07-08T14:13:13  <bhasker> my take is the current structure of the game makes for a very boring watch
2011-07-08T14:13:21  <bhasker> compared to planetwars which was a lot more fun
2011-07-08T14:15:00  <sir_macelon> it's an early stage still, so I wouldn't expect some great battles yet
2011-07-08T14:15:24  <bhasker> the beta has been long enough for some sophisticated bots to emerge
2011-07-08T14:15:32  <bhasker> the beta has been as long as the contest for planetwars

2011-07-08T14:16:07  <bhasker> also maybe the wraparound is not a great idea , makes for a larger territory to protect
2011-07-08T14:16:26  <bhasker> non wrapping maps may lead to greater territory control wars
2011-07-08T14:16:34  <bhasker> which would be more fun to watch
2011-07-08T14:17:02  <mcstar> i hope there will be maze-maps
2011-07-08T14:17:13  <mcstar> antimat. is working on generating them
2011-07-08T14:17:40  <sir_macelon> bhasker: but I agree planet wars contest was very interesting, I regret I found it so late and couldn't compete really
2011-07-08T14:17:56  <mcstar> i think fow is important and realistic, and the wrapping makes the game more interesting
2011-07-08T14:18:16  <bhasker> dunno wrapping and ant spawn rates don't match up making territory defense very hard
2011-07-08T14:18:25  <bhasker> so you can't like easily mark out territory
2011-07-08T14:18:26  <sir_macelon> bhasker: you still can generate maps surrounded by water, island-like
2011-07-08T14:18:38  <bhasker> i guess one could
2011-07-08T14:19:00  <bhasker> having a wrap around map doubles the perimeter you need to defend
2011-07-08T14:19:17  <bhasker> actually more than double
2011-07-08T14:19:23  <bhasker> quadruples

2011-07-08T14:19:40  <mcstar> bhasker: if you want you can choose to use water as a defensive guard
2011-07-08T14:19:57  <bhasker> the maps right now don't have enough water
2011-07-08T14:20:03  <mcstar> some had
2011-07-08T14:20:12  <bhasker> and ant spawn rates make it impossible to block  anything effectively
2011-07-08T14:20:16  <mcstar> mcleo was experimenting with high symmetry maps
2011-07-08T14:20:22  <bhasker> since the perimeter is much much larger than available ants
2011-07-08T14:21:09  <mcstar> as far as i can see, if anything kills this contest, it might be the too simplistic battle resolution
2011-07-08T14:21:18  <mcstar> but its more like a guess
2011-07-08T14:23:38  <McLeopold> amstan: what's up?
2011-07-08T14:23:49  <amstan> the worker is crashing
2011-07-08T14:23:58  <amstan> check the screen on the main server
2011-07-08T14:24:07  <McLeopold> ok
2011-07-08T14:24:55  <McLeopold> I see some kill commands...
2011-07-08T14:25:44  <amstan> yes, run it and see what happens
2011-07-08T14:25:55  <amstan> something about bad json

2011-07-08T15:19:23  <sir_macelon> mcstar: depends on actual stage of the project; at the beginning I usually start with pen and paper before writing any code; then if I have some backbone already, I start the implementation and unit tests
2011-07-08T15:20:00  <mcstar> ok, im glad im not the only one who has a "real" notebook
2011-07-08T15:20:03  <sir_macelon> at later stages new ideas are just some TODOs in the code
2011-07-08T15:20:21  <sir_macelon> where they would actualy fit
2011-07-08T15:20:50  <mcstar> sir_macelon: do you comment for yourself?
2011-07-08T15:21:19  <sir_macelon> of course and write java-docs everywhere
2011-07-08T15:21:37  <sir_macelon> it's better then to analyse back the "old" code
2011-07-08T15:21:48  <sir_macelon> what I had in mind when writing this and why
2011-07-08T15:21:53  <mcstar> i guess, but i cant really do that infortunately
2011-07-08T15:22:00  <mcstar> u
2011-07-08T15:22:31  <sir_macelon> why?
2011-07-08T15:22:41  <mcstar> im just not used to it
2011-07-08T15:23:11  <sir_macelon> i wasn't also, but then after trying that I've found a very good practice
2011-07-08T15:23:14  <mcstar> and i rewrite things quite often(at least in this stage) so it wouldnt be of much use
2011-07-08T15:24:07  <sir_macelon> well, if I am unsure of something I don't document it yet
2011-07-08T15:24:26  <sir_macelon> but at least leave a short comment what's the general idea behind it
2011-07-08T15:24:46  <sir_macelon> maybe later I'll change, but idea would stay the same, if it was good
2011-07-08T15:25:21  <sir_macelon> so it's rather about giving only some rough background, then explaining deeply what does the code do
2011-07-08T15:27:08  <mcstar> ill try to more "commentive" than i am now
2011-07-08T15:28:33  <sir_macelon> you will surely benefit from that

2011-07-08T16:54:03  <amstan> yes, till now we had the ec2 workers, but for today idk how to access them
2011-07-08T16:54:11  <sir_macelon> mcstar: that's what the unit tests are for! :)
2011-07-08T16:54:53  <sir_macelon> amstan: only janzert knows that I suppose...?
2011-07-08T16:55:12  <mcstar> sir_macelon: unit tests?
2011-07-08T16:55:22  <mcstar> as in measurement? m,sec,kg?
2011-07-08T16:55:58  <sir_macelon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing ^^
2011-07-08T16:56:05  <mcstar> i was kidding
2011-07-08T16:56:16  <mcstar> but honestly how would you unit test this?
2011-07-08T16:56:18  <sir_macelon> heh :)
2011-07-08T16:56:31  <mcstar> write a small map, where you know the exact conditions?
2011-07-08T16:56:41  <sir_macelon> exactly!
2011-07-08T16:56:48  <mcstar> seems too much work
2011-07-08T16:56:51  <mcstar> :D
2011-07-08T16:56:52  <sir_macelon> unit tests should as small as possible
2011-07-08T16:57:37  <mcstar> i just nil-led a lot of variables all at once, and silly me left in the water vector too :S
2011-07-08T16:57:51  <mcstar> i guess i was low on coffeine at that moment
2011-07-08T16:58:22  <mcstar> sir_macelon: i promise you, if i become a professional, ill unit tests
2011-07-08T16:58:29  <mcstar> ill do*
2011-07-08T16:58:37  <sir_macelon> "shit happens", but unit tests are always there to help :)
2011-07-08T16:59:04  <sir_macelon> it's more a matter of a good habit and practice than being a professional
2011-07-08T16:59:29  <mcstar> sir_macelon: do you insert assert's in to the code? (idk whats that called in java, but you get the point)
2011-07-08T17:00:01  <sir_macelon> mcstar: only in the unit tests
2011-07-08T17:00:10  <mcstar> ok
2011-07-08T17:00:16  <sir_macelon> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=67911 0-turn game :(
2011-07-08T17:00:21  <ibdknox> it not uncommon to have asserts in production code
2011-07-08T17:00:28  <ibdknox> it's*
2011-07-08T17:00:36  <ibdknox> not just the unit tests
2011-07-08T17:00:46  <sir_macelon> I don't like asserts outside unit tests
2011-07-08T17:00:56  <sir_macelon> I consider it as a bad practice
2011-07-08T17:01:07  <sir_macelon> unit tests should cover such cases
2011-07-08T17:01:08  <mcstar> another "problem" with lisp, is that i dont have to use types
2011-07-08T17:01:24  <mcstar> it makes debugging a little harder
2011-07-08T17:01:53  <mcstar> but if i can pull a feature out, maybe put it in a separate package, then i use type declarations
2011-07-08T17:01:55  <sir_macelon> I don't know anything about lisp
2011-07-08T17:02:05  <mcstar> but its mainly to speed up the code
2011-07-08T17:02:29  <mcstar> in my a* algorithm, all but a few functions have types declared in them
2011-07-08T17:02:45  <mcstar> sir_macelon: sorry to hear that
2011-07-08T17:03:15  <mcstar> the bigger problem is that i can debug my running program
2011-07-08T17:03:27  <mcstar> cause it has the 1sec limit, and the engine kills it
2011-07-08T17:04:21  <sir_macelon> known issue, you would need to have your own engine without timing considerations
2011-07-08T17:04:33  <mcstar> i have
2011-07-08T17:04:35  <sir_macelon> that's why I use unit tests for debugging
2011-07-08T17:04:52  <mcstar> but im sort of lazy to put my logic class into it, cause it would need a small rewrite
2011-07-08T17:05:05  <mcstar> but if i finish my snake now, then i think ill put it in my engine
2011-07-08T17:05:07  <sir_macelon> mcstar: you have? but how can you be sure it works just the same as the original one?
2011-07-08T17:05:39  <mcstar> its not exactly the same, but could run my logic before a rewrite
2011-07-08T17:05:42  <sir_macelon> you're writing a snake bot? it is already there
2011-07-08T17:05:49  <mcstar> it has different battle resolution
2011-07-08T17:05:59  <mcstar> sir_macelon: i havent written one yet
2011-07-08T17:06:07  <mcstar> so im sure mine is not already there :)
2011-07-08T17:06:55  <sir_macelon> I don't see a point in that, but as you wish :)
2011-07-08T17:07:07  <mcstar> and i want to test my recursive-resolve framework
2011-07-08T17:07:09  <ibdknox> as a learning exercise?
2011-07-08T17:07:14  <mcstar> sure
2011-07-08T17:07:14  <sir_macelon> I consider it a as a waste of time
2011-07-08T17:07:16  <mcstar> what else?
2011-07-08T17:07:30  <ibdknox> how is that a waste of time?
2011-07-08T17:07:56  <sir_macelon> you would learn more from trying to improve your own bot rather than trying to do the snake one
2011-07-08T17:08:04  <mcstar> :S
2011-07-08T17:08:05  <ibdknox> lol
2011-07-08T17:08:05  <sir_macelon> that's my opinion
2011-07-08T17:08:21  <mcstar> i sort of dont see the point, but sure
2011-07-08T17:08:37  <ibdknox> that's faulty logic
2011-07-08T17:08:51  <ibdknox> since a snake bot could be the improvement of your own

2011-07-08T17:09:30  <ibdknox> sometimes it's just fun to mess around too.
2011-07-08T17:09:31  <sir_macelon> how come it can be an improvement?
2011-07-08T17:09:57  <ibdknox> if the snake bot is doing better than your implementation, what have you done?
2011-07-08T17:10:04  <ibdknox> improved your bot
2011-07-08T17:10:12  <ibdknox> this is a ridiculous semantic argument
2011-07-08T17:10:25  <mcstar> and with a snake bot you can improve on some specifics
2011-07-08T17:10:31  <sir_macelon> yes, you can also try to write a bot which forms his ants to mimic letters and words, trying to say something :)
2011-07-08T17:10:38  <mcstar> than what works, pull it into your other code..
2011-07-08T17:10:52  <mcstar> sir_macelon: what is wrong with that?
2011-07-08T17:10:57  <ibdknox> and there's nothing wrong with that
2011-07-08T17:11:05  <sir_macelon> ibdknox: snake bot is a dead end strategy
2011-07-08T17:11:06  <mcstar> obviously that would require a nice robust control framework
2011-07-08T17:11:17  *** FireFly <FireFly!~firefly@unaffiliated/firefly> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-08T17:11:19  <ibdknox> sir_macelon: snake bot is a different way of solving the problem
2011-07-08T17:11:24  <sir_macelon> like you would base your strategy on a bad idea
2011-07-08T17:11:27  <mcstar> sir_macelon: i didnt say i consider it good strategy-wise
2011-07-08T17:11:28  <ibdknox> lol
2011-07-08T17:11:32  <mcstar> obviously it sucks
2011-07-08T17:11:42  <ibdknox> you completely fail to understand the point of this entire thing
2011-07-08T17:11:53  <ibdknox> the point isn't just to win
2011-07-08T17:11:57  <ibdknox> if it is, you're doing it wrong
2011-07-08T17:12:01  <sir_macelon> the point is it doesn't solve the problem efficiently and has upper bound limit
2011-07-08T17:12:03  <ibdknox> you will learn a very narrow swath of AI
2011-07-08T17:12:29  <mcstar> sir_macelon: i understand that a snake has huge limitations but the control of it can be smarter than another bot's that is using less logic
2011-07-08T17:12:37  <sir_macelon> i would recommend to try to write a tron bot rather then a snake bot in ants
2011-07-08T17:12:41  <ibdknox> a much better outcome, beyond simply winning, is to learn
2011-07-08T17:12:53  <ibdknox> sir_macelon: he's not trying to win
2011-07-08T17:12:58  <ibdknox> your advice is good
2011-07-08T17:13:00  <ibdknox> if he was
2011-07-08T17:13:11  <ibdknox> moreover, you often find great insight in the things that don't win
2011-07-08T17:13:13  <mcstar> ibdknox: ill try, but not with the snake :D
2011-07-08T17:13:15  <sir_macelon> well, we have different goals then
2011-07-08T17:13:39  <ibdknox> to look only at winning solutions is folly
2011-07-08T17:13:44  <sir_macelon> i would do that maybe after the competition is over
2011-07-08T17:13:56  <ibdknox> it hasn't even begun yet ;)
2011-07-08T17:13:59  <mcstar> sir_macelon: you see, it hasnt even started, whats the hurry?
2011-07-08T17:14:29  <sir_macelon> but really there's so many things you could try implement to learn that you really won't have enough time for
2011-07-08T17:14:40  <ibdknox> hell, I'm just trying to go the Clojure stuff to work at this point
2011-07-08T17:14:52  <ibdknox> get*
2011-07-08T17:15:19  <mcstar> ibdknox: how are you gooing with it?
2011-07-08T17:15:43  <ibdknox> mcstar: there seems to be something weird going on with Java on the server?
2011-07-08T17:15:47  <sir_macelon> no hurry, but I prefer to use the time to improve my bot rather than trying ideas which doesn't help me in achievieng my goal :)
2011-07-08T17:15:48  <mcstar> im interested in clojure, i find the idea nice: lisp on java's framework
2011-07-08T17:16:07  <ibdknox> ah, in terms of Clojure itself, it's wonderful :)
2011-07-08T17:16:14  <mcstar> ah, ok
2011-07-08T17:16:27  <ibdknox> I highly recommend it
2011-07-08T17:17:10  <mcstar> do you know racket?
2011-07-08T17:17:31  <ibdknox> some, though racket isn't nearly as pragmatic as Clojure and, as such, less interesting to me
2011-07-08T17:17:57  <mcstar> pragmatic?
2011-07-08T17:18:11  <ibdknox> Clojure was designed to build production software in
2011-07-08T17:18:16  <mcstar> more functional?
2011-07-08T17:18:30  <ibdknox> Racket is trying to move there from Scheme, which is extremely academic
2011-07-08T17:19:16  <mcstar> i saw you can interface directly with java's library(i dont know whats that called)
2011-07-08T17:19:30  <ibdknox> you have access to any and all Java code
2011-07-08T17:19:41  <ibdknox> which is very useful when you're trying to build something real
2011-07-08T17:20:24  <ibdknox> in a lot of ways, Clojure is better at writing Java than Java is ;)
2011-07-08T17:20:37  <mcstar> well, i hope so
2011-07-08T17:20:42  <ibdknox> hehe
2011-07-08T17:20:49  <ibdknox> yeah, I'm not a fan
2011-07-08T17:21:08  <ibdknox> the JVM, however, is amazing
2011-07-08T17:21:47  <mcstar> is it compiling to machine code?
2011-07-08T17:21:51  <mcstar> like sbcl?
2011-07-08T17:22:04  <ibdknox> Clojure compiles to Java Byte Code
2011-07-08T17:22:12  <ibdknox> and runs on the JVM
2011-07-08T17:22:26  <mcstar> so jvm cant execute machine code directly
2011-07-08T17:22:38  <ibdknox> not to my knowledge
2011-07-08T17:23:16  <mcstar> i really like sbcl, its obviously a high level language, but you can very much control the code it outputs
2011-07-08T17:23:31  <mcstar> and always compiles to macine code
2011-07-08T17:23:58  <ibdknox> mm
2011-07-08T17:24:09  <ibdknox> the need for machine code in most applications is fairly low
2011-07-08T17:24:11  <mcstar> im glad that i considered lisp for the contest, im not sure if i could do this in c
2011-07-08T17:24:19  <ibdknox> and the JVM can actually beat it in certain scenarios
2011-07-08T17:24:24  <ibdknox> due to runtime optimizations
2011-07-08T17:24:25  <mcstar> well, you can make high performace code
2011-07-08T17:24:36  <ibdknox> turning tight loops into jump tables and such
2011-07-08T17:25:51  <mcstar> ibdknox: can you tell me when [] is used?
2011-07-08T17:26:01  <ibdknox> it's a vector
2011-07-08T17:26:23  <mcstar> (defn square [x]
2011-07-08T17:26:25  <mcstar>   (* x x))
2011-07-08T17:26:27  <mcstar> here?
2011-07-08T17:26:27  <ibdknox> so an indexed array where addition occurs at the end
2011-07-08T17:26:30  <ibdknox> right
2011-07-08T17:26:36  <ibdknox> so to make things easier to parse
2011-07-08T17:26:46  <mcstar> i dont get this
2011-07-08T17:26:49  <ibdknox> Clojure uses vectors for all of its "binding forms"
2011-07-08T17:26:53  <mcstar> aham
2011-07-08T17:27:01  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-08T17:27:03  <ibdknox> this is done because order matters
2011-07-08T17:27:08  <mcstar> aham
2011-07-08T17:27:37  <mcstar> you mean like if i push to a list, the new element appears on the front?
2011-07-08T17:27:45  <ibdknox> correct
2011-07-08T17:27:48  <mcstar> why is this a problem for bindings?
2011-07-08T17:28:06  <mcstar> when you travel on the cdr's you get the same order
2011-07-08T17:28:12  <mcstar> i mean from left to right
2011-07-08T17:28:28  <ibdknox> it's not specifically a problem in the binding case versus a list, it is a specific argument against maps
2011-07-08T17:28:58  <ibdknox> in the defn case it's purely to make it more obvious what the params are (as far as I know)
2011-07-08T17:29:05  <ibdknox> but take the (let) form
2011-07-08T17:29:09  <ibdknox> which looks like this:
2011-07-08T17:29:20  <ibdknox> (let [x 1 y 2] (println x y))
2011-07-08T17:29:50  <ibdknox> most people would assume a map makes more sense, as this represents a key and a value
2011-07-08T17:30:09  <ibdknox> but you need those to be evaluated in the ordered they're set in
2011-07-08T17:30:18  <mcstar> cl has let and let*
2011-07-08T17:30:22  <ibdknox> yep
2011-07-08T17:30:48  <mcstar> sorry, i dont get it
2011-07-08T17:30:59  <mcstar> x bind first, the y
2011-07-08T17:31:02  <mcstar> s
2011-07-08T17:31:10  <mcstar> x binds first, then y
2011-07-08T17:31:12  <ibdknox> yes
2011-07-08T17:31:27  <ibdknox> so that I could use x in y's definition
2011-07-08T17:31:30  <ibdknox> couldn't do that with a map
2011-07-08T17:31:37  <ibdknox> but I went off on a tangent
2011-07-08T17:31:39  <mcstar> yes, but why do you need []?
2011-07-08T17:32:10  <ibdknox> the reason for not using a list is not a technical argument, I don't believe
2011-07-08T17:32:18  <ibdknox> -don't
2011-07-08T17:32:44  <mcstar> i think its nice that i have to use *
2011-07-08T17:32:48  <ibdknox> Rich believed it was easier to make lists primarily mean one thing: execute this
2011-07-08T17:32:56  <mcstar> it explicitely shows me that theres something fishy there
2011-07-08T17:33:15  <mcstar> aham
2011-07-08T17:33:22  <mcstar> makes more sense this way
2011-07-08T17:33:46  <ibdknox> which way?
2011-07-08T17:34:03  <mcstar> as you lastly put it
2011-07-08T17:34:16  <ibdknox> yeah, sorry got off on the wrong foot there
2011-07-08T17:34:35  <ibdknox> so anywhere you would use a list as an actual list, you use vector instead
2011-07-08T17:34:38  <mcstar> can a symbol has function value and value at the same time?
2011-07-08T17:34:52  <ibdknox> can you give me an example?
2011-07-08T17:34:57  <ibdknox> I can do this:
2011-07-08T17:35:06  <ibdknox> (def my-func (fn [x] x))
2011-07-08T17:35:13  <ibdknox> (my-func 1)
2011-07-08T17:35:47  <mcstar> so no
2011-07-08T17:35:56  <mcstar> its like scheme then
2011-07-08T17:36:27  <ibdknox> clojure is a Lisp-1 if that's what you're asking
2011-07-08T17:36:27  <mcstar> i can say (list list) => (4) if list had the 4 as value, and the list functions as its function value
2011-07-08T17:36:31  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-08T17:37:08  <ibdknox> here's a great video targeted at CL guys: http://blip.tv/clojure/clojure-for-lisp-programmers-part-1-1319721
2011-07-08T17:37:23  <ibdknox> it's worth watching
2011-07-08T17:37:45  <mcstar> thx
2011-07-08T17:39:25  <mcstar> one more thing, can you splice lists directly?
2011-07-08T17:39:38  <ibdknox> destructure, you mean?
2011-07-08T17:39:58  <mcstar> like this (fun @(list 1 2 3 4)) => (fun 1 2 3 4)
2011-07-08T17:40:15  <ibdknox> with macros, yes
2011-07-08T17:40:15  <mcstar> its not a correct syntax, i used it for the idea
2011-07-08T17:40:18  <mcstar> without
2011-07-08T17:40:23  <ibdknox> no
2011-07-08T17:40:30  <ibdknox> but that is easily solved with apply
2011-07-08T17:40:33  <mcstar> yes
2011-07-08T17:40:40  <ibdknox> (apply fun [args1 args2])
2011-07-08T17:40:56  <mcstar> i tell you what i had in mind:
2011-07-08T17:41:44  <mcstar> let say fun takes 4 arguments, but i have 2 lists which i would need to destrucutre(use first and second) to call fun
2011-07-08T17:42:05  <mcstar> (fun (first list1) (second list1) (first list2) (second list2))
2011-07-08T17:42:13  <mcstar> and id like to do this:
2011-07-08T17:42:22  <mcstar> (fun @list1 @list2)
2011-07-08T17:42:47  <ibdknox> (apply fun (concat list1 list2))
2011-07-08T17:42:55  <mcstar> but actually i think i can do this with a reader macro
2011-07-08T17:42:56  <ibdknox> you might not even need the concat
2011-07-08T17:43:08  <ibdknox> you might just be able to do
2011-07-08T17:43:13  <ibdknox> (apply fun list1 list2)
2011-07-08T17:43:15  <ibdknox> I'm not sure
2011-07-08T17:43:20  <mcstar> apply conses up its arguments
2011-07-08T17:43:24  <mcstar> so it wouldnt work
2011-07-08T17:43:40  <mcstar> neither with funcall
2011-07-08T17:43:47  <ibdknox> I meant in Clojure :)
2011-07-08T17:43:54  <mcstar> i meant in cl
2011-07-08T17:44:13  <mcstar> i dont think clojure would differ
2011-07-08T17:44:17  <mcstar> but you could try :)
2011-07-08T17:45:00  <ibdknox> (apply + 1 2 '(3 4))  ; equal to (apply + '(1 2 3 4))
2011-07-08T17:45:07  <ibdknox> it appears that does work
2011-07-08T17:46:24  <mcstar> (cons 1 (cons 2 (list 3 4)))
2011-07-08T17:46:46  <ibdknox> yep
2011-07-08T17:46:49  <ibdknox> you're right
2011-07-08T17:47:23  <ibdknox> the simple solution with concat works fine though
2011-07-08T17:47:31  <mcstar> yes, i guess
2011-07-08T17:47:36  <mcstar> but its not that clear
2011-07-08T17:47:48  <mcstar> and there can be other things than lists in the arguemnt list
2011-07-08T17:47:56  <mcstar> and you would need to first listify those
2011-07-08T17:48:08  <ibdknox> In Clojure, concat works with all sequences
2011-07-08T17:48:33  <ibdknox> but yeah
2011-07-08T17:48:37  <ibdknox> if you had single calues
2011-07-08T17:48:38  <mcstar> can you concatenate a number with a list? i doubt it
2011-07-08T17:48:38  <ibdknox> values*
2011-07-08T17:48:54  <ibdknox> mhm
2011-07-08T17:49:21  <ibdknox> Just depends on what you expect the inputs to be
2011-07-08T17:49:45  <ibdknox> it's not hard to deal with single values, and there's no reason you can't do this completely generally
2011-07-08T17:49:55  <ibdknox> tuck it away in a function somewhere and never worry about it again :)
2011-07-08T17:50:12  <mcstar> i forgot the name of the macro im loooking for
2011-07-08T17:50:28  <mcstar> that would tranform the code the way id like it

2011-07-08T17:56:06  <ibdknox> ah
2011-07-08T17:56:14  <ibdknox> Clojure has that too:
2011-07-08T17:56:23  <ibdknox> #(+ %1 %2)
2011-07-08T17:56:31  <mcstar> nice
2011-07-08T17:56:37  <ibdknox> implicit argument declaration

2011-07-08T17:56:53  <ibdknox> nice
2011-07-08T17:56:59  <mcstar> can you nest them?
2011-07-08T17:57:01  <ibdknox> how much code did it take to implement that?
2011-07-08T17:57:09  <mcstar> ill take a look
2011-07-08T17:57:16  <ibdknox> nope, they're meant solely for simple one off functions
2011-07-08T17:57:36  <ibdknox> I would think the nested %1's would get dreadfully confusing anyways

2011-07-08T17:58:18  <mcstar> i can nest mine, as long as obviously you use $N correctly
2011-07-08T17:58:47  <mcstar> if one $N appears after another $, then obviously it will belong to that
2011-07-08T17:58:57  <ibdknox> yeah
2011-07-08T17:59:17  <mcstar> but i can say: ($ (funcall ($ (+ $1 $2)) $1 $2)$1 $1)

2011-07-08T18:01:07  <mcstar> but i can say: ($ (funcall ($ (+ $1 $2)) $1 $2))
2011-07-08T18:01:13  <jmcarthur> how about this to make the game more interesting... in order to spawn an ant, you have to "control" the food for n turns, where "control" means it's uncontested and uninterrupted
2011-07-08T18:01:17  *** eashoka <eashoka!70875258@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.135.82.88> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-07-08T18:01:27  <jmcarthur> that would encourage fights more often
2011-07-08T18:01:51  <mcstar> jmcarthur: you mean to guard it?
2011-07-08T18:01:52  <jmcarthur> another effect would be to lower the overall number of ants in the game
2011-07-08T18:01:54  <ibdknox> that would definitely change how you play the game
2011-07-08T18:01:55  <jmcarthur> yeah, basically
2011-07-08T18:02:03  <mcstar> thats good too
2011-07-08T18:02:10  <ibdknox> as in the strategies would be very different
2011-07-08T18:02:15  <jmcarthur> this is re: the earlier conversation about making the game less simplistic
2011-07-08T18:02:15  <mcstar> but i still prefer mine
2011-07-08T18:02:33  <mcstar> i mean , i dont see the implications of any of them clearly :S
2011-07-08T18:02:33  <ibdknox> what was yours?
2011-07-08T18:02:44  <jmcarthur> i skimmed very quickly, so i don't know what yours is either
2011-07-08T18:03:02  <mcstar> well, that to gain 1 ant, you need to eat 2 foods, within a couple of turns
2011-07-08T18:03:15  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-08T18:03:31  <jmcarthur> the same ant needs to eat 2 foods?
2011-07-08T18:03:33  <jmcarthur> or any ant
2011-07-08T18:03:35  <jmcarthur> ?
2011-07-08T18:03:47  <mcstar> id say any
2011-07-08T18:04:14  <jmcarthur> how does this change things? i'm not seeing a big strategic difference
2011-07-08T18:04:16  <ibdknox> the same any would require ants to have "roles"
2011-07-08T18:04:18  <mcstar> that doesnt make much sense, do restrict it to the same ant
2011-07-08T18:04:24  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-08T18:04:33  <jmcarthur> making it the same is a bit more interesting maybe
2011-07-08T18:04:51  <ibdknox> yeah
2011-07-08T18:04:57  <jmcarthur> that means that once that ant has eaten one food it is now "special" and might need to be guarded
2011-07-08T18:05:04  <ibdknox> mhm
2011-07-08T18:05:07  <jmcarthur> would this specialness be visible to your opponents?
2011-07-08T18:05:14  <ibdknox> no
2011-07-08T18:05:22  <jmcarthur> i think it might be nicer if it is
2011-07-08T18:05:31  <jmcarthur> would encourage opponents to be more offensive
2011-07-08T18:05:35  <mcstar> jmcarthur: if the same would need to eat again, the time limit would need to be much longer
2011-07-08T18:05:37  <ibdknox> then it turns into a hunting game
2011-07-08T18:05:47  <jmcarthur> mcstar: i agree, but don't think that's a bad thing
2011-07-08T18:05:58  <jmcarthur> ibdknox: and a guarding game
2011-07-08T18:06:08  <ibdknox> indeed
2011-07-08T18:06:09  <mcstar> jmcarthur: actually i like your idea more
2011-07-08T18:06:14  <jmcarthur> use your lesser ants to guard your greater ants
2011-07-08T18:06:21  <jmcarthur> i think i do too
2011-07-08T18:06:27  <jmcarthur> but yours isn't bad either
2011-07-08T18:06:28  <ibdknox> a combo of the two might be very interesting
2011-07-08T18:07:41  <mcstar> but again, its too late for this kind of changes i believe
2011-07-08T18:07:49  <jmcarthur> we have a beta for a reason
2011-07-08T18:08:14  <mcstar> but we proposed nice battle startegies, and all that went to waste
2011-07-08T18:08:19  <mcstar> because of time constrints
2011-07-08T18:08:22  <mcstar> a
2011-07-08T18:08:46  <jmcarthur> we have already switched battle resolution methods since the beta started, haven't we?
2011-07-08T18:09:04  <mcstar> yeah, but its still too simple
2011-07-08T18:09:15  <jmcarthur> agreed
2011-07-08T18:09:26  <mcstar> and people are pressing to open up the contest
2011-07-08T18:09:27  <jmcarthur> my point is just that we have already set a precedent for changing things in the beta
2011-07-08T18:09:51  <jmcarthur> people have been pressing since before the game was even implemented :P
2011-07-08T18:09:54  <mcstar> jmcarthur: its not like im some kinf of authority, id welcome those changes
2011-07-08T18:10:24  <jmcarthur> i think i'd like to ping some of bigger names in the contest about it
2011-07-08T18:10:29  <jmcarthur> i think i know what j3camero would say
2011-07-08T18:10:33  <jmcarthur> (no)
2011-07-08T18:10:35  <ibdknox> out of curiosity, who *is* the authority?
2011-07-08T18:10:39  <jmcarthur> j3camero:
2011-07-08T18:10:48  <jmcarthur> without the colon of course :\
2011-07-08T18:11:03  <mcstar> i believe there are others too
2011-07-08T18:11:11  <mcstar> lets mention mcleo too
2011-07-08T18:11:12  <jmcarthur> yeah, but jeff has the final word, really

2011-07-08T23:35:37  <mleise> You first start ureadahead in 'tracing' mode for x seconds, where it will find all files loaded by the system during that time. It then looks at their physical location on the HDD and writes the names down in optimal order.

2011-07-08T23:36:25  <amstan> and then every time you boot it reads them in optimal order based on that list?
2011-07-08T23:36:42  <mleise> The files in this list are loaded during the next boot. This takes ... I think 20 seconds or so for me. But after that the boot process finishes as if it used a solid state drive.
2011-07-08T23:36:51  <amstan> epic... why isn't this default?

2011-07-08T23:37:54  <mleise> It still requires that you manually run a trace session when you changed a lot of files
2011-07-08T23:38:40  <mleise> even reordering the files on the same disk would be a bad idea. so it is more something for geeks i guess
2011-07-08T23:39:23  <mleise> anyway I simply added a boot line to grub so i can switch between tracing and non-tracing boot easily
2011-07-08T23:39:54  <mleise> it was just a matter of adding "gentoo=force-tracing" to the line
2011-07-08T23:40:26  <amstan> well, can't it record what files that are not on the list? or that were never used?
2011-07-08T23:40:33  <amstan> that way it's dynamic
2011-07-08T23:49:36  <_flag> melise: you say arch has this by default?

2011-07-08T23:52:38  <mleise> _flag: I think it is an arch tool, yes. but i'm not 100% sure on this
2011-07-08T23:53:10  <amstan> mleise: ubuntu already has this? i never knew
2011-07-08T23:53:50  <mleise> amstan: I don't know why they made it so static. It looks as if in 'normal' boot mode it doesn't do any special kernel magic and just loads the files in the most robust way
2011-07-08T23:54:14  <mleise> just check if you have a /var/lib/ureadahead directory
2011-07-08T23:54:28  <amstan> yep
2011-07-08T23:54:49  <_flag> I ask because I'm an arch user who would probably find it worthwhile to go through a major hassle for a small speed upgrade :P

2011-07-08T23:56:18  <mleise> oh yes, use the arch-linux link of course
2011-07-08T23:56:45  <_flag> Is this something that's going to make it into the main-line kernel? Do you know?
2011-07-08T23:57:26  <mleise> I have no clue, but I read something about rebasing the patch everytime the syscall changes... it didn't sound promising
2011-07-08T23:57:44  <mleise> then again, look at ubuntu :)
2011-07-08T23:57:50  <_flag> Yeah, I wouldn't want to have to repatch the kernel everytime I do a kernel update
2011-07-08T23:58:24  <_flag> Ubuntu has the advantage of only doing major updates once every 6 months though
2011-07-08T23:59:07  <mleise> "[...] and if none are found or if the packfiles are older than a month, it starts tracing the boot process" Ahhhh! Cool stuff!
2011-07-08T23:59:11  <amstan> mleise: apparently it already does reprofile: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1434502
2011-07-08T23:59:18  <amstan> mleise: i have to delete the pack file, then reboot
2011-07-08T23:59:45  <mleise> amstan: why would you delete the files?
2011-07-08T23:59:58  <amstan> mleise: i can force a reprofile that way
