2011-06-11T02:50:29  <antimatroid> ahh, but you aren't :p
2011-06-11T02:57:42  <Pyronaut> Hi guys, I know I asked yesterday about people building a C# starter package, Just wondering if we still need one since I am part way through finishing up one for my own uses (Simply parsing the game data and storing it in various lists, very basic), or is there already someone assigned for the job.
2011-06-11T03:00:05  <antimatroid> pretty sure someone's already filled that hole
2011-06-11T03:00:51  <antimatroid> wait, maybe they haven't
2011-06-11T03:00:55  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots
2011-06-11T03:00:59  <antimatroid> that's where all the current ones are
2011-06-11T03:01:24  <janzert> so far as I know were still in the state of several having been started but no finished ones have appeared yet
2011-06-11T03:01:27  <antimatroid> pyronaut: are you familiar with the "strategy" for starter bots?
2011-06-11T03:02:06  <Pyronaut> There isn't any current C# starterbots, but on the forums and on git people have "said" that they will do it. But so far no one has.
2011-06-11T03:02:18  <Pyronaut> I do know someone is on the ladder with a C# bot that I thought possibly could be doing it.
2011-06-11T03:02:21  <antimatroid> meh, do it and we'll use yours
2011-06-11T03:02:27  <Pyronaut> Just asking so I don't step on anyones toes.
2011-06-11T03:02:39  <antimatroid> s'all good i think
2011-06-11T03:02:45  <antimatroid> if you do, i'm sure they'll get over it ;)
2011-06-11T03:03:05  <antimatroid> janzert: did you see the conversation about blocking :\
2011-06-11T03:03:08  <Pyronaut> antimatroid, Somewhat, can pull the strategies from the other starter packages.
2011-06-11T03:03:15  <antimatroid> damage option allows blocking
2011-06-11T03:03:34  <janzert> yes, we already knew that though
2011-06-11T03:03:38  <antimatroid> in my biased opinion i think the c++ bot is best to base it off :P
2011-06-11T03:03:43  <antimatroid> i changed it recently though btw
2011-06-11T03:03:44  <janzert> I didn't read the conversation
2011-06-11T03:04:00  <antimatroid> it allows blocking of corridors of >2 width
2011-06-11T03:04:05  <antimatroid> i didn't realise that
2011-06-11T03:04:15  <janzert> hmm, I thought we know that too
2011-06-11T03:04:25  <janzert> it's limited to 3 though isn't it?
2011-06-11T03:04:29  <antimatroid> no
2011-06-11T03:04:32  <janzert> at least with the current radius
2011-06-11T03:04:34  <antimatroid> no
2011-06-11T03:04:47  <Pyronaut> :P. Not too familiar with C++ syntax. Will use something that I can copy and paste over and just change the syntax :). Anyway thank you!
2011-06-11T03:04:57  <janzert> oh, it can block any width?
2011-06-11T03:05:20  <janzert> that could be bad enough to change
2011-06-11T03:05:22  <antimatroid> not sure on the actual water configurations needed, but yeah, there were examples of larger corridors that were blocked
2011-06-11T03:06:25  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/CjKYcN5J
2011-06-11T03:06:57  <antimatroid> note the middle a's are within the battle radius of the top/bottom b's
2011-06-11T03:07:35  <antimatroid> imo it's be harder to block with attack2 = 5 again, but even then it was still blockable i think
2011-06-11T03:07:43  <antimatroid> but i haven't properly tested that either
2011-06-11T03:08:10  <janzert> hmm :(
2011-06-11T03:08:23  <antimatroid> yeah, that's what i thought
2011-06-11T03:08:36  <antimatroid> we basically hope it doesn't stagnate the top games or change the battle option :\
2011-06-11T03:09:27  <antimatroid> mcleopold's who i really want to talk to about it
2011-06-11T03:09:31  <antimatroid> and maybe sigh
2011-06-11T03:09:35  <antimatroid> i missed sigh earlier :\
2011-06-11T03:10:07  <janzert> yep, I'm still trying to stay out of game mechanic decisions if possible :}
2011-06-11T03:10:18  <antimatroid> hehe yep, fair enough

2011-06-11T04:46:52  <stocha> if blocking becomes to much of a burden, rather than going back 2 month and endlessly arguing on battle resolution again, refine the water evaporate idea. because it affect map dynamic which isn't settled anyway. And it solves all blocking problems.
2011-06-11T04:47:15  <stocha> people will still have to block if that is efficient. But can't count on that for winning against all opponents.
2011-06-11T04:47:46  <stocha> evaporating water is a nice garantee that games will finish also.
2011-06-11T04:48:07  <stocha> it's certainly harder to have stalemate on a no water map.
2011-06-11T04:49:03  <stocha> of course you would have to change the sending protocol, wich rely on water never changing.
2011-06-11T04:49:42  <stocha> but that's not something people will argue endlessly with, like fighting resolution.
2011-06-11T04:49:49  <stocha> well, my 2 cents in :p
2011-06-11T04:50:26  <stocha> if only fixed sized (<6) twisted corridor can be blocked, needing a lot of ant, we need to test to see if it is really a problem anyway.
2011-06-11T04:50:41  <stocha> most block are unidirectionnal also.
2011-06-11T04:51:26  <stocha> i found a bug in stocha bot. Where it would behave badly with certain map sizes.
2011-06-11T04:52:08  <stocha> too bad i can't see easilly the map size on the test server :p to find games where the bug hit hard.

2011-06-11T06:23:31  <george1914> i havent really followed the combat rules discussion so apologies if it's been said before ...     but if there were also some chance in the battles  ('dice roll' with weighted probabilities depending on the configuration) then that would mean defences could be broken with enough ants attacking, albeit at a high cost ...
2011-06-11T06:24:37  <antimatroid> george1914: you would be fine with probabilistic fight fules?
2011-06-11T06:24:46  <antimatroid> i couldn't think of much worse personally
2011-06-11T06:24:55  <Zaphus> that would be horrible - I'd be blaming the engine for every battle I lost
2011-06-11T06:24:57  <antimatroid> hard to debug your bot, hard to tell if someone fairly won etc. etc.
2011-06-11T06:25:33  <antimatroid> i'm not fond of disappearing water either
2011-06-11T06:25:41  <Zaphus> I see no issue with the defenses.  it probably will be the case that someone will work out good defenses - but people will also work out good attack patterns (they exist too) where you can hunt down and kill ants
2011-06-11T06:25:52  <george1914> well, re won fairly - i rely on the server to get that right - not an issue for contestants
2011-06-11T06:26:03  <antimatroid> yes, but what we don't want is everyone expanding then setting up shop with defenses
2011-06-11T06:26:11  <antimatroid> that would be really boring and make for long drawn out games
2011-06-11T06:26:34  <antimatroid> george1914: yes, but "fairness" is messy without bringing chance into it
2011-06-11T06:26:48  <george1914> and for debugging - not so hard, is it - i get the map from the game server each go, so it is not any harder - i just have to read the map as usual
2011-06-11T06:27:08  <antimatroid> yeah, but what about on small test cases when you are testing the behaviour of your bot
2011-06-11T06:27:16  <antimatroid> it'll be much harder to work out what's happened each turn
2011-06-11T06:28:26  <antimatroid> otherwise you could have the death rule be something like, if you have enemies in range, your probability of dying is 1-1/noEnemies
2011-06-11T06:28:30  <Zaphus> stay away from randomness, keep the battle with set rules.   throw in some maps that are mostly open area, the defensive bots will get there a$$es kicked by the attacking ones on those
2011-06-11T06:28:47  <antimatroid> Zaphus: yeah i agree, more open maps
2011-06-11T06:29:02  <antimatroid> i'll be working on map stuff after the 23rd
2011-06-11T06:29:47  <Zaphus> any form of randomness sucks, because you can feel like the dice were rolled against you - it's bad enough that the matchmaker is unpredictable and your ranking is at it's mercy, plus that some starting positions are worse than others (from what I have seen)
2011-06-11T06:30:04  <antimatroid> starting positions worse?
2011-06-11T06:30:12  <antimatroid> only based on your relative neighbours?
2011-06-11T06:30:19  <george1914> well, if you play games like risk etc, the randomness is a fine part of the game
2011-06-11T06:30:26  <antimatroid> the ranking algorithm is meant to somewhat account for your matchings
2011-06-11T06:30:43  <antimatroid> so are asymmetric games in computer games
2011-06-11T06:30:43  <george1914> rthere will be 1000s of battles per game, so good averaging.
2011-06-11T06:30:59  <antimatroid> but taking it to ai and ranking these bots, i prefer more fairness enforced
2011-06-11T06:32:19  <george1914> the main source of 'unfair' randomness would/will be who you play against and where you start compared to opponents ...   whereas unfairness over a few 1000 battles is small
2011-06-11T06:32:48  <antimatroid> yeah, true, i still don't like random fighting :P
2011-06-11T06:33:03  <george1914> anyway, it was just a suggestion,  fair enough if yous prefer other options
2011-06-11T06:33:13  <Zaphus> I suggest that someone tries to make a defensive bot that can win, to show that there is a problem.  the one I've created (Zaphus_blocktest) does well, but that is mostly because it plays the same as 'Zaphus' for the first 200 turns.  it then steals some second places due to the blocking because nobody else is doing it yet
2011-06-11T06:33:15  <antimatroid> it's something people have suggested a lot
2011-06-11T06:33:22  <antimatroid> i was curious at your interest given your placing in pw :)
2011-06-11T06:33:59  <antimatroid> i don't mind defense, in fact i think it'll be awesome, provided it isn't the only strategy people use
2011-06-11T06:34:13  <antimatroid> i want to see defense structures broken down, people going around them and coming in from the back, etc.
2011-06-11T06:34:42  <carlop> i see two main pros with chance battle:
2011-06-11T06:34:43  <carlop> -block are no more possible (defence still have a bonus, cause they have position, but 1000v5 stalemate should not be possible)
2011-06-11T06:34:45  <carlop> -micro management is way more interesting, cause now i think that almost all 2v1 battle between good bot end with a death for side (that's almost the same of 1v1 battle, so go together is better)
2011-06-11T06:34:54  <Zaphus> btw, the 'defense' set up by Zaphus_blocktest is only occasionally real defense, most of the lines it makes are breakable - it was just easier to write that way.  it beats dumb attacks every time though
2011-06-11T06:35:24  <carlop> i'm working on my blocking bot, but i don't have a lot of time, i hope that tomorrow can be ready, but don't know
2011-06-11T06:36:18  <Zaphus> I'm going to modify this one sometime this weekend, but it's actually quite hard to find really useful blocks.   finding a place that will keep a couple of ants alive to the end is relatively easy, but won't get you a win
2011-06-11T06:36:22  <carlop> but I see that changing thing now is not a good thing
2011-06-11T06:36:31  *** olexs <olexs!~Leviathan@drms-590ece28.pool.mediaWays.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-11T06:37:26  <carlop> sorry, I want to write that go together sucks now, cause 2v1 end almost the same way of 1v1
2011-06-11T06:37:38  <carlop> 1 death for side
2011-06-11T06:38:39  <Zaphus> yeah, you have to move very cleverly to get a 2v1 guaranteed win
2011-06-11T06:39:12  <Zaphus> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=20224  - this is where blocking will cause problems...   my bot wins the map because the leading bot couldnt cope with how many ants I let it have, so it timed out and gave me the bonus :-)
2011-06-11T06:39:53  <carlop> i haven't investigated yet, but i think that a clever alone ant can alway kill one of the attacker ant, or keep his position
2011-06-11T06:41:07  <Zaphus> clever is good - clever with obstacles (water) is very good
2011-06-11T06:42:37  <george1914> well, i guess if we choose maps that always have big open routes (in addition to blockable routes) then it will be fine - we just dont want 'mazes' that everyone locks up on
2011-06-11T06:43:56  <george1914> if you had both open and 'closed' maps, then i would make my bot play differently for each one - 'proper' play for the open one and corridor blocking/fighting play for the closed one

2011-06-11T07:11:20  <xQuasar> Did it run out of disk space or something?
2011-06-11T07:14:20  <antimatroid> that's another problem with defense structures
2011-06-11T07:14:24  <antimatroid> the games will always go to max turns
2011-06-11T07:15:03  <xQuasar> antimatroid, any idea what my error is about?
2011-06-11T07:15:10  <antimatroid> nope sorry
2011-06-11T07:15:35  <xQuasar> Who should I ask about it
2011-06-11T07:15:36  <xQuasar> :o
2011-06-11T07:16:09  <antimatroid> amstan, mcleopold maybe?
2011-06-11T07:16:14  <antimatroid> probably amstan
2011-06-11T07:16:16  <antimatroid> not really sure
2011-06-11T07:16:38  <xQuasar> ok. thanks

2011-06-11T08:06:03  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Let's suppose you want quickly evaluate your bot's new version strength. You have played 30 games. What is more important for you to see: average place, average scores, total scores, times you was eliminated, something else?
2011-06-11T08:06:03  <UncleVasya> Anyone's else answers are welcome.
2011-06-11T08:06:35  <antimatroid> i test my bots behaviour with small localised examples
2011-06-11T08:06:53  <antimatroid> then i might consider my strategy after watching it play games
2011-06-11T08:06:59  <antimatroid> and see where it could be done better
2011-06-11T08:07:06  <antimatroid> then try to alter my strategy based off that
2011-06-11T08:07:42  <antimatroid> an easyish way to run your bot locally is to just feed "made up input" to it and see what moves it makes

2011-06-11T08:24:45  <stocha> we need to activate the java bot, to judge blocking. Most strong bot are concerned with the java loading problem
2011-06-11T08:25:07  <Zaphus> interesting, I havent done that (feed made-up situations).  wish we could dump one frame of the replay into a set of input files ready to go :-)
2011-06-11T08:25:11  <stocha> from the given link, i doubt that zaphus blocker will fare well.
2011-06-11T08:25:24  <stocha> i think he would loose against himself non blocking :p
2011-06-11T08:26:04  <Zaphus> indeed, it's not so much blocking as 'awakening the idea of blocking for other people'
2011-06-11T08:26:27  <stocha> have you tryed blocker zaphus against non blocker zaphus locally ? (or even on the server after all, but that will be slow)
2011-06-11T08:26:28  <Zaphus> it doesnt even try to do proper blocks, just roughly close to blocking - I wrote it at 1am last night, close enough
2011-06-11T08:26:48  <stocha> fair enough
2011-06-11T08:27:11  <Zaphus> the blocker version will always lose, since the non-blocker will beat it's score.  the only win it gets against Zaphus is when my main bot times out because it has so many ants :-)
2011-06-11T08:27:49  <Zaphus> e.g. this one: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=20074   (replay has the wrong final order of bots, the blocker wins that one)
2011-06-11T08:28:01  <stocha> well, at some point score was supposed to meseare one ability go fight with good ration. Blocker is supposed to get a good ratio.
2011-06-11T08:29:41  <Zaphus> yeah, lots of stuff that you 'should' do - and if people do it then good on them I reckon.  the odds of being able to get far enough in front to block and win, but you would have lost otherwise, seem slim.  more likely blocking is how the other bots fill out the lower places :-)
2011-06-11T08:30:26  <stocha> i don't know
2011-06-11T08:30:32  <stocha> i think in some situation blocking will be good
2011-06-11T08:30:35  <stocha> if used well
2011-06-11T08:30:42  <stocha> but the question is : how to use it well ?
2011-06-11T08:30:55  <stocha> and then you need to be able to do it in the first place.
2011-06-11T08:31:34  <Zaphus> and to find the situation - I think the combination will be hard to do .   right now suicide (1-1) attacks are a perfectly effective strategy once you have a lead
2011-06-11T08:34:05  <antimatroid> stocha: you helped convince me of the spawn points! :P
2011-06-11T08:34:45  <antimatroid> Zaphus: I wrote the c++ starter bot without an engine, just feeding fake data to it :P

2011-06-11T08:44:19  <stocha> anyone with some skill in c to write a base for me ? :p
2011-06-11T08:44:32  <stocha> i wanted to rewrite the stocha bot in c.
2011-06-11T08:44:47  <stocha> (so i can run in the messy test environnement :p )
2011-06-11T08:45:20  <stocha> i'll have a look at the cpp i guess
2011-06-11T08:47:04  <stocha> i guess i should try to write a c starter. Then people can point out what i did wrong. hopefully :p
2011-06-11T08:47:34  <stocha> mmm, where is the starter speck ?

2011-06-11T08:52:03  <stocha> i guess some people like myself will want a pure C stuff.
2011-06-11T08:52:45  <stocha> beside, if you do it in c, you don't want it to show as "c++" on the langage info :p
2011-06-11T08:52:52  <antimatroid> i thought someone did a c bot
2011-06-11T08:52:58  <antimatroid> but maybe they never finished/uploaded it
2011-06-11T08:53:02  <stocha> i certainly can't seems to find it
2011-06-11T08:54:01  <stocha> wow starter bot is a pretty evolved thing.
2011-06-11T08:54:10  <stocha> i guess i'll do something simpler to start with.
2011-06-11T08:54:41  <stocha> like : pick a random direction for each ant, with no care.
2011-06-11T08:57:58  <antimatroid> evolved how?
2011-06-11T08:58:02  <george1914> antimatroid:  sorry if i missed your reply, but did you see github issue #181?  i was wanting to ask you about it, if i could ...
2011-06-11T08:58:10  <antimatroid> ?
2011-06-11T08:58:56  <antimatroid> george1914: i think i've updated this
2011-06-11T08:58:57  <george1914> well, it seems that the 'r' is not sent any more
2011-06-11T08:59:02  <george1914> ah, right
2011-06-11T08:59:09  <antimatroid> yeah, the c++ bot got updated earlier this week
2011-06-11T08:59:22  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T08:59:54  <george1914> but the current c++ download still has the 'r' line in it
2011-06-11T09:00:14  <george1914> and (as of yesterday) i thought it was getting the food locations wrong

2011-06-11T09:01:42  <antimatroid> i had been slack, sorry :)
2011-06-11T09:01:58  <antimatroid> i also fixed the timer so it will work on all windows compilers (hopefully) now
2011-06-11T09:02:22  <antimatroid> but if someone uses the windows timer on linux, they'll get clock time rather than wall time
2011-06-11T09:02:32  <antimatroid> hopefully people listen to my comment warning

2011-06-11T09:02:59  <george1914> is it the case that your new c++ has not been uploaded?

2011-06-11T09:03:55  <george1914> certainly i have been confused ...  :)
2011-06-11T09:04:19  <stocha> how do people emit debug information from a bot ?
2011-06-11T09:04:34  <stocha> like i want to see what the engine send to the bot :p
2011-06-11T09:04:41  <george1914> i submitted an issue 'that's not my bot'    because it was clearly not moving as mine did in games - turn out it was chasing phantom food ...   :)
2011-06-11T09:05:09  <antimatroid> does anyone have visual c++ installed on windows?
2011-06-11T09:05:22  <antimatroid> george1914: yeah, sorry about that :P
2011-06-11T09:05:30  <antimatroid> i've known about the problem since 'r' lines got removed and been slack
2011-06-11T09:05:44  <antimatroid> i was waiting to do it when i fixed the timer, and was slack about that to be precise
2011-06-11T09:05:54  <george1914> no problem, thanks for working on the contest, and for replying to my questions ...  :)

2011-06-11T09:06:49  <george1914> i dont know this stuff so well,  but i have seen preprocessor stuff to distinguish windows/linux specific code in c++ - might be how you neatly beat the 2 timers problem ...
2011-06-11T09:07:06  <antimatroid> did i see something about there being an issue from you about it?
2011-06-11T09:07:11  <antimatroid> is that still open? I might close it
2011-06-11T09:07:59  <antimatroid> yeah that's what i'm doing with the timer now, see here https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp/Timer.h

2011-06-11T09:09:37  <locutus2> is their a problem or make the admins changes on the server
2011-06-11T09:09:42  <antimatroid> i only know c++
2011-06-11T09:09:50  <antimatroid> i can flounder around in python

2011-06-11T09:11:34  <george1914> stocha:  why you using c?   is this for learning?   if not then i would just use c++ if i were you - should be almost as fast etc
2011-06-11T09:11:40  <stocha> every parameter in the starting phase is given as plain integer ?
2011-06-11T09:11:50  <locutus2> stocha: i can make an c starter bot based on the c++ starterbot

2011-06-11T09:12:13  <stocha> george1914: well, c is more straight forward :p  And yes it's also for "learning"
2011-06-11T09:12:21  <george1914> (i do not know c btw - but am reliably informed that c++ will be about as fast in most cases)
2011-06-11T09:12:32  <antimatroid> i find c++ easier than c
2011-06-11T09:12:36  <stocha> locutus2: how much time would it take you ?
2011-06-11T09:12:43  <antimatroid> very rarely need to use pointers or dynamic memory
2011-06-11T09:12:50  <antimatroid> in fact the only time i do is for game tree's
2011-06-11T09:13:05  <antimatroid> otherwise I just pass references around etc.
2011-06-11T09:13:14  <stocha> george1914: c++ allow you to write plain c. but does not always run on plain c compilation
2011-06-11T09:13:28  <antimatroid> stocha: code::blocks with mingw compiler!
2011-06-11T09:13:38  <stocha> antimatroid: uh ?
2011-06-11T09:13:45  <antimatroid> c++ <3 :P
2011-06-11T09:14:02  <stocha> C++ is just a way to make C langage messy :p
2011-06-11T09:14:05  <stocha> even more messy
2011-06-11T09:14:14  <antimatroid> only if you're doing it wrong
2011-06-11T09:14:41  <stocha> mm, i'm not convinced myself. it's just that c is older, and still used in a lot of tasks
2011-06-11T09:15:04  <stocha> and c is a subset of c++ afterall
2011-06-11T09:15:28  <stocha> beside, there were c bots in previous contests.
2011-06-11T09:15:32  <locutus2> i think 3-4 hours (must implement some stuff like queue which in c++ is standard)
2011-06-11T09:15:48  <antimatroid> george1914: have you squared your euclidean metric locally?
2011-06-11T09:15:56  <locutus2> i try the c starter bot
2011-06-11T09:15:58  <george1914> stocha:  as you wish :)   i think people have all kinds of opinions on this, go with what you find best   -  me, i like the 'fancier' stuff in c++, and dislike what little i know of the   ugly/raw  stuff in c   -  but go with what you like.
2011-06-11T09:16:00  <antimatroid> that way all your distance calculations are integers and no square root calculations
2011-06-11T09:16:01  <stocha> locutus2: maybe i should try to do it, for learning, then you can review ?

2011-06-11T09:17:28  <george1914> for planetwars, i wrote some ok code,  then later optimised  using profiler
2011-06-11T09:17:29  <antimatroid> that's the state file for c++
2011-06-11T09:17:48  <george1914> something about   'premature optimisation is the root of all evil' ...

2011-06-11T09:18:37  <stocha> yeah optimization is a nasty beast. It will come to haunt you, if you don't plan for it. And even more so if you do plan for it :p
2011-06-11T09:18:54  <antimatroid> meh, i plan my strategies out well in advanced to progamming
2011-06-11T09:18:57  <stocha> Maybe optimization is a Zen concept.
2011-06-11T09:19:02  <george1914> ... most code i wrote was not critical for speed - the 10% or so that was, i improved later
2011-06-11T09:19:06  <antimatroid> i plan my optimisations into my strategy
2011-06-11T09:19:48  <stocha> antimatroid: trouble is, i can't read others code. So i'm starting from the spec.
2011-06-11T09:20:02  <antimatroid> yeah i can't read other people's code either
2011-06-11T09:20:24  <stocha> can someone add to the spec, the fact that the values are plain integer ?
2011-06-11T09:20:39  <george1914> antimatroid:  in most things i have written, it has been the ideas/plan and correct implementaion that are critical
2011-06-11T09:20:41  <stocha> "viewradius2"    # view radius squared etc
2011-06-11T09:20:43  <antimatroid> erm silly me, i have "std::"'s on that page, when i don't need them
2011-06-11T09:20:55  <george1914> spped came low down in importance

2011-06-11T09:21:19  <george1914> and is -usually- easyish to improve if needed
2011-06-11T09:21:27  <george1914> i was in tron
2011-06-11T09:21:31  <george1914> 31st i think

2011-06-11T09:22:46  <george1914> i generrally have managed to have modular stuff ...    so i can change individual functions/classes   at later points,  so easier to optimise specific parts ...
2011-06-11T09:23:00  <antimatroid> we were ~10th at the time
2011-06-11T09:23:14  <antimatroid> (did that one with a friend

2011-06-11T09:23:46  <UncleVasya> is this friend participating now?
2011-06-11T09:23:55  <george1914> i tried to only use <0.5s because i was so scared of timing out ...
2011-06-11T09:24:01  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: they didn't in tron, i doubt they'll find time for ants
2011-06-11T09:24:10  <antimatroid> i didn't realise it was disqualificaiton
2011-06-11T09:24:18  <antimatroid> we didn't time out on the official server until that happened
2011-06-11T09:24:24  <antimatroid> it was incredibly devestating
2011-06-11T09:24:29  <george1914> i bet
2011-06-11T09:24:54  <george1914> so, are you now an organiser rather than participant?
2011-06-11T09:25:04  <antimatroid> i am a contributer
2011-06-11T09:25:06  <antimatroid> i can compete still

2011-06-11T09:25:14  <stocha> locutus2: what about i use a chained list for storing stuff issued from the engine ?
2011-06-11T09:25:33  <antimatroid> only people who can't compete are those with access to the main servers
2011-06-11T09:25:40  <antimatroid> what i can do is all open source

2011-06-11T09:26:01  <antimatroid> stocha: just learn c++ :P

2011-06-11T09:26:54  <stocha> mm, i think i will use chained list
2011-06-11T09:26:57  <george1914> i agree with antimatroid, stocha  :)
2011-06-11T09:27:00  <antimatroid> c++ is almost my perfect language
2011-06-11T09:27:32  <stocha> http://advice.cio.com/esther_schindler/linus_torvalds_why_c_sucks
2011-06-11T09:27:35  <antimatroid> if i could use templates in .cc files, overload anything as an operator, overload operator precedence, have a better type system and treat functions like variables, then i would be in heaven
2011-06-11T09:27:49  <antimatroid> i love the syntax
2011-06-11T09:29:15  <antimatroid> also, there's some weird thing that if you don't use templates then you have to do <</>> functions in .cc instead of .h otherwise it wont compile :\
2011-06-11T09:29:27  <antimatroid> i still don't understand why that happens, george1914 any idea?
2011-06-11T09:30:08  <antimatroid> oh, and another gripe is the fact that vectors of bools have some weird type that wont let you return a reference to an element of one
2011-06-11T09:30:11  <george1914> sorry, way beyond my level ...   i hardly used templates
2011-06-11T09:30:27  <antimatroid> which means you can't reference a matrix struct of bools with a location, it doesn't work!

2011-06-11T09:35:18  <antimatroid> generating my tree is the costly part, evaluating it isn't that expensive, it's not alright to just prune with alpha beta while generating
2011-06-11T09:35:33  <antimatroid> i would probably use it in the future when evaluating the tree, but i was a complete noob back then

2011-06-11T09:36:08  <george1914> the nash?   well i searched eg 10moves deep on the game tree, but moves were simultaneous, so each move had a payoff matrix, with maybe mixed strategy as the nash equilibrium ...
2011-06-11T09:36:23  <antimatroid> mixed strategy?
2011-06-11T09:36:33  <antimatroid> that would have been expensive to computer, you need to solve a linear program
2011-06-11T09:36:36  <george1914> hm,, maybe i am getting my terms wrong
2011-06-11T09:36:42  <george1914> i mean
2011-06-11T09:36:49  <george1914> eg 2 players are close to each other
2011-06-11T09:37:08  <george1914> so on next move, we might eg crash, or 1 traps the other, etc
2011-06-11T09:37:28  <george1914> best strategy can be to make some move with certain probability, right?
2011-06-11T09:37:42  <george1914> there is not a unique best move for me to make
2011-06-11T09:38:17  <george1914> yes, it took a little code to do it, and some cpu cost
2011-06-11T09:38:29  <george1914> but i did that at each node in the game tree
2011-06-11T09:38:36  <antimatroid> we broke our payoff function into something like the following lost < separating with less squares < together with them being able to access more squares first < draw < separate with the same number of squares < together with the same number of squares < together with more squares accessible first < win

2011-06-11T09:51:28  <george1914> yes, for tron
2011-06-11T09:51:36  <george1914> but i think also for most other problems ...
2011-06-11T09:51:56  <locutus2> stocha: have you looked on github? There is a c starterbot (ok, dump).
2011-06-11T09:52:28  <antimatroid> minimax on a zero sum game tree gives you the best worst outcome when they are playing optimally
2011-06-11T09:52:54  <antimatroid> if they play less than optimally, you do at least as well, probably better, this condition doesn't hold for non-zero sum games
2011-06-11T09:52:58  <antimatroid> which ants is not
2011-06-11T09:53:23  <george1914> aha? now that is something i could have done with knowing for tron ...
2011-06-11T09:53:45  <antimatroid> it's a bit iffy when you're treating the game as sequential rather than simultaneous
2011-06-11T09:53:51  <antimatroid> but imo it's fairly sound in most instances
2011-06-11T09:54:03  <george1914> but, can i not improve on minimax for simultaneous?  my guess was/is that you could
2011-06-11T09:54:10  <antimatroid> i believe people came up with some examples where you might be able to game the fact that the bot was using minimax
2011-06-11T09:54:17  <george1914> ah, so you say it is 'almost the best'  ?
2011-06-11T09:54:21  <carlop> i think a main part of this contest is resolve rock paper scissor situation modeling other player behavior, not solving the game against an optimal opponent

2011-06-11T09:55:15  <antimatroid> i considered partitioning the ants up into sets that can affect each other then game treeing it, but toooooooooooooo^99999 many states
2011-06-11T09:55:33  <george1914> yes, i was wondering about that
2011-06-11T09:55:40  <antimatroid> i would make the move that maximised my worst outcome for each combination of moves from the other ants
2011-06-11T09:55:41  <george1914> hard to partition though ...
2011-06-11T09:56:08  <antimatroid> not too hard, do a bfs from each ant collecting and continuing searches as you find other ants
2011-06-11T09:56:29  <antimatroid> the hardest part of not adding ants that can't affect each other because of water on either end of your search
2011-06-11T09:56:35  <antimatroid> i still haven't worked out a neat way to do that
2011-06-11T09:56:55  <george1914> hm - i meant:  if i have 2 ants far apart, then kind of ...
2011-06-11T09:57:04  <george1914> it is 2 cases of 1-ant decisions
2011-06-11T09:57:12  <george1914> not a 2-ant decision
2011-06-11T09:57:30  <george1914> so 2*5 possible moves
2011-06-11T09:57:36  <george1914> instead of 5*5 possible moves
2011-06-11T09:58:14  <antimatroid> if you have 5 ants with 4 moves each, that's 4^5 states to look at
2011-06-11T09:58:32  <george1914> 5^5 (can stand still)
2011-06-11T09:58:43  <george1914> but yes
2011-06-11T09:58:52  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm assuming some might be next to water or something :P
2011-06-11T09:58:59  <george1914> ok, fine
2011-06-11T09:59:04  <antimatroid> that's not that bad
2011-06-11T09:59:07  <antimatroid> 1024 states
2011-06-11T09:59:17  <george1914> and 5 independent ants  is 5*4
2011-06-11T09:59:19  <antimatroid> you have to do battle resolution on the terminal n odes though
2011-06-11T09:59:45  <antimatroid> you could game tree some battles then heuristic the rest
2011-06-11T09:59:53  <antimatroid> and limit the max size of a partition
2011-06-11T10:00:01  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T10:00:14  <george1914> so for me, i think that good partitioning is the hard part
2011-06-11T10:00:26  <george1914> dont know if/how well  i can do it
2011-06-11T10:00:42  <antimatroid> yeah, do you go for ants close to the battles or far out first?
2011-06-11T10:01:00  <antimatroid> what split do you have between your ants and others ants in a partition
2011-06-11T10:01:10  <george1914> and in an area that is all battles, what to do?
2011-06-11T10:01:22  <antimatroid> also, you can do backward induction with this
2011-06-11T10:01:38  <george1914> but i think it is a good avenue to explore ...
2011-06-11T10:01:44  <george1914> backward induction?
2011-06-11T10:02:00  <antimatroid> just at each node, bring up say your worst outcome at each of an opponents nodes, then your best outcome at each of your nodes, then go back through and select the optimal moves at each of your nodes afterwards
2011-06-11T10:02:28  <george1914> so minimax?
2011-06-11T10:02:32  <antimatroid> not quite
2011-06-11T10:02:49  <antimatroid> minimax would have you bring up the worst outcome to you from the optimal moves of them at each node
2011-06-11T10:03:01  <antimatroid> you are now bringing up the worst regardless of what they are doing
2011-06-11T10:03:12  <antimatroid> so dropping the assumption that they are rational/optimal opponents
2011-06-11T10:03:19  <george1914> ah
2011-06-11T10:03:31  <george1914> btw, do you know much about the contest details?
2011-06-11T10:03:33  <antimatroid> if you wanted to get really complex, you could tit for tat who you wanted to cooperate with/who plays optimmally
2011-06-11T10:03:38  <antimatroid> depends what
2011-06-11T10:03:49  <george1914> ah, tit for tat  :)
2011-06-11T10:03:57  <george1914> that would/will be interesting  :)
2011-06-11T10:04:02  <antimatroid> wont* :P
2011-06-11T10:04:12  <antimatroid> it would be awesome, but no way trying to cooperate will payoff in this
2011-06-11T10:04:14  <george1914> re contest ...
2011-06-11T10:04:30  <george1914> well, it might do ...
2011-06-11T10:04:42  <george1914> do you know eg the 2-dimensional prisoners dilemma
2011-06-11T10:04:49  <Zaphus> Is it worth updating the starter bot to watch the timer and avoid timeouts, so people can see how to do it (like the fact that you need to set it to ~half the supplied turn value if prev. contests are anything to go by
2011-06-11T10:05:08  <antimatroid> i already show them how to check how long they've taken
2011-06-11T10:05:11  <george1914> or even the round-robin PD, that tit for tat won?
2011-06-11T10:05:12  <antimatroid> they should be able to work it out from there
2011-06-11T10:05:57  <Zaphus> ah, yes you do.
2011-06-11T10:06:04  <antimatroid> you only get cooperation being optimal for repeated prisoners dilemma if it's infinitely repeated or the end is probabilitically determined (pseudo infinite)
2011-06-11T10:06:24  <antimatroid> probabilistically*
2011-06-11T10:06:38  <george1914> ie if the end time is not known ...
2011-06-11T10:07:04  <Zaphus> who wrote that win32 timer function ?
2011-06-11T10:07:06  <antimatroid> yeah, so the game ends with some probabilty, not sure what the requirements (if there are any) on the probability required for cooperation
2011-06-11T10:07:10  <george1914> but here we are kind of repeated - 100 moves in a game
2011-06-11T10:07:15  <antimatroid> Zaphus: I went googling :P
2011-06-11T10:07:41  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  I thought these comps used wall clock time (much to my hatred) ?   that code gives CPU time
2011-06-11T10:08:00  <antimatroid> Zaphus: it gives wall clock on windows
2011-06-11T10:08:15  <Zaphus> oh, ok
2011-06-11T10:08:15  <antimatroid> it's to everyone's hatred that we use wall clock, blame windows
2011-06-11T10:08:24  <Zaphus> why blame windows ?
2011-06-11T10:08:26  <antimatroid> it's too hard to use clock time with cross platform
2011-06-11T10:08:37  <antimatroid> we've looked at doing it numerous times and never found a way
2011-06-11T10:08:49  <Zaphus> so you run servers on different platforms ?
2011-06-11T10:08:53  <antimatroid> no
2011-06-11T10:08:56  <antimatroid> but people test on windows
2011-06-11T10:09:05  *** paratrechina <paratrechina!56439097@gateway/web/freenode/ip.86.67.144.151> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-11T10:09:10  <antimatroid> it's a cross platform contest, the servers are all ubuntu i think
2011-06-11T10:09:17  <Zaphus> that should be irrelevant, they also test on slower and faster machines than the server
2011-06-11T10:09:48  <Zaphus> if you used CPU time, it would at least be consistent between one run and the next on the server, I found it was inconsistent in PW
2011-06-11T10:10:15  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't like how the servers were used for planet wars games
2011-06-11T10:10:20  <antimatroid> it will hopefully be better with this
2011-06-11T10:10:24  <carlop> george1914: if the end is guaranteed after a fixed number of turn, cooperation is not an equilibrium (don't matter if there are 10 or 100K move left), but for ants I don't know how many intelligent bot there are in final contest, that should understand if their opponent are collaborating or not
2011-06-11T10:10:45  <antimatroid> we are now "pausing" the processes of bots while they aren't picking their moves, and only one bot is picking moves on a processor at a time
2011-06-11T10:11:02  <Zaphus> carlop:  why would I collaborate with another bot ?
2011-06-11T10:11:05  <antimatroid> previously you had 1 second shared with a bot, so worst case 0.5 seconds - other stuff
2011-06-11T10:11:34  <Zaphus> antimatroid: thats a big change... didnt realise, so I can't do any processing between turns (never did, but it was theoretically possible in PW)
2011-06-11T10:11:47  <antimatroid> yep, hopefully we've fixed that ;)
2011-06-11T10:12:03  <george1914> carlop:  if you, me, and antimatroid write 1 each, then we have a nucleus  :)
2011-06-11T10:12:28  <carlop> Zaphus: try to collaborate with me.... you don't need to defend border agaisnt me, trust me :p
2011-06-11T10:12:39  <antimatroid> it's not about cooperating with certain other bots, it's about cooperating when it's mutually beneficial in that game for you to
2011-06-11T10:12:47  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T10:13:05  <Zaphus> I guess so...   again, good luck to anyone who manages that!
2011-06-11T10:13:15  <antimatroid> yep, that's what i've concluded
2011-06-11T10:13:19  <antimatroid> and decided not to cooperate
2011-06-11T10:13:31  <antimatroid> i don't see it paying off
2011-06-11T10:13:35  <carlop> seriously, sometimes is better cooperate for ending 1 and 2 than kill your enemy (and kill your ant too) on the first few turn
2011-06-11T10:13:52  <antimatroid> i'm more referring to cooperating with a battle to kill an enemy
2011-06-11T10:13:58  <antimatroid> rather than perhaps a macro cooperation
2011-06-11T10:14:01  <antimatroid> i'm talking micro
2011-06-11T10:14:22  <george1914> antimatroid: since you like game theory - do you know axelrod's prisoners' dilemma tournaments?
2011-06-11T10:14:26  <antimatroid> where you need to assume they can play reasonably optimally, which i'm rather concerned about my own ability to do :P
2011-06-11T10:14:34  <antimatroid> george1914: no?
2011-06-11T10:14:55  <george1914> well, they were where i first came across g.t.
2011-06-11T10:15:01  <george1914> maybe have a read on it
2011-06-11T10:15:09  <carlop> I think that both macro and micro cooperation are almost impossible, but we will see
2011-06-11T10:15:23  <george1914> the tit-for-tat won, and won the rematch
2011-06-11T10:15:26  <antimatroid> i tend to agree
2011-06-11T10:15:31  <antimatroid> of course it did :P
2011-06-11T10:15:34  <george1914> even against 'complex' opponents
2011-06-11T10:15:43  <george1914> it was a shock at the time
2011-06-11T10:15:49  <antimatroid> why?
2011-06-11T10:15:56  <george1914> why a shock?
2011-06-11T10:16:07  <antimatroid> it can also depend on who the opponents are in the contest
2011-06-11T10:16:13  <george1914> i think the question is why are you not surprised?
2011-06-11T10:16:17  <antimatroid> that's one of the things that makes games so complicated
2011-06-11T10:16:30  <Zaphus> all this feels like analysis-paralysis, trying to imagine what people might do and whether to stop it (blocking, cooperation, etc) when it's all theoretical :-)
2011-06-11T10:16:40  <antimatroid> because tit for tat is a great strategy for generating cooperation in such situations
2011-06-11T10:16:51  <george1914> well anyway, tit-for-tat 'enforced cooperation'
2011-06-11T10:16:52  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T10:16:55  <antimatroid> Zaphus: i'm studying pure maths :P
2011-06-11T10:17:03  <george1914> and possibly this can be done in other cases
2011-06-11T10:17:09  <george1914> ants i am not sure about
2011-06-11T10:17:21  <Zaphus> antimatroid:  yeah, did that decades ago (pure maths + comp sci)
2011-06-11T10:17:21  <george1914> but maybe
2011-06-11T10:17:42  <antimatroid> i did maths, comp sci and economics majors for undergrad :P
2011-06-11T10:17:51  <antimatroid> soooo many overloads
2011-06-11T10:17:58  <Zaphus> ouch!
2011-06-11T10:18:26  <george1914> antimatroid:  to youngsters like you it seems obvious hey?  i guess it has since become part of 'standard knowledge'
2011-06-11T10:18:38  <UncleVasya> Who is imagine?
2011-06-11T10:18:52  <antimatroid> yeah, that's the deal with heindsight :P
2011-06-11T10:19:02  <george1914> :)
2011-06-11T10:19:14  <antimatroid> it's like minimax with games like ches
2011-06-11T10:19:20  <antimatroid> or nash equilibria
2011-06-11T10:19:32  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T10:19:38  <antimatroid> nash coming up with and proving existence of a nash equilibria doesn't seem all that amazing to me
2011-06-11T10:19:47  <antimatroid> it's a fairly straight forward application of fixed points
2011-06-11T10:19:57  <george1914> anyway, should we agree a standard 'ant dance' now, that we dont attack each other?
2011-06-11T10:20:02  <antimatroid> it is an awesome application of them though, and not a trivial feat
2011-06-11T10:20:31  <Zaphus> I'll arrange my ants to spell out the words "PLAY NICE" in 3x5 font
2011-06-11T10:20:41  <george1914> :)
2011-06-11T10:20:44  <antimatroid> i'll draw a penis
2011-06-11T10:21:02  <antimatroid> that will never stop being funny to me
2011-06-11T10:21:10  <carlop> or "KILL HIM ---->"
2011-06-11T10:21:15  <antimatroid> finish him!
2011-06-11T10:21:18  <antimatroid> ftfy
2011-06-11T10:21:19  <george1914> i want to signal - 'i am willing to be a peace with you, BUT if you attack me, then i will irrationally attack you'

2011-06-11T10:28:19  <george1914> hm
2011-06-11T10:28:22  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T10:28:26  <antimatroid> we haven't been able to test stuff like that up until now
2011-06-11T10:28:54  <george1914> i would like to write bot soon, but would prefer not to have to change much when/if rules/settings change ...
2011-06-11T10:29:09  <antimatroid> yeah, i would wait till at least the official launch
2011-06-11T10:29:19  <george1914> how does a bot know the spawnrate?
2011-06-11T10:29:26  <antimatroid> it doesn't
2011-06-11T10:29:32  <george1914> i read it on the website, and code it in?
2011-06-11T10:29:35  <george1914> right
2011-06-11T10:29:54  <antimatroid> you might be able to do it if it's ever "locked in", otherwise don't assume stuff :P
2011-06-11T10:29:59  <antimatroid> i hate people who do that :P
2011-06-11T10:30:07  <antimatroid> (poke at map stuff from pw)
2011-06-11T10:30:23  <george1914> ?
2011-06-11T10:30:35  <antimatroid> remember when the maps changed towards the end of planet wars?
2011-06-11T10:30:42  <george1914> i dont mean try to hard-code specific maps
2011-06-11T10:30:54  <carlop> i think you can approximate spawnrate after a while into the game, but you don't know it
2011-06-11T10:31:01  <antimatroid> people assumed that the other map generator was meant to be used in the final contest, that wasn't actually the case, they just assumed it
2011-06-11T10:31:36  <george1914> i just mean - knowing the rate at which food arrives at a square is useful for deciding how often to check areas - what is Prob(food now there)
2011-06-11T10:31:44  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-06-11T10:31:51  <george1914> yes - but in PW it was known that the maps would change ...
2011-06-11T10:31:55  <antimatroid> atm, the official answer is you shouldn't assume you know the rate
2011-06-11T10:32:02  <george1914> so they had little reason to complain
2011-06-11T10:32:07  <antimatroid> in reality, after a while you can probably assume it'll stay where it's at
2011-06-11T10:32:15  <george1914> i guess so
2011-06-11T10:32:18  <antimatroid> they complained anyway :P
2011-06-11T10:32:26  <antimatroid> and i agree the change was too late
2011-06-11T10:32:33  <antimatroid> but i'd been waiting for the change and no one did it
2011-06-11T10:32:38  <antimatroid> so i did when i finished exams
2011-06-11T10:32:38  <george1914> i just wondered if a big map got less food-per-unit-area than a small one?
2011-06-11T10:32:55  <antimatroid> dunno, we haven't even worked out what size maps to use yet
2011-06-11T10:32:55  <george1914> hm
2011-06-11T10:33:04  <antimatroid> i think the games on the beta server are too long?
2011-06-11T10:33:12  <antimatroid> do we really need them to take that long to work out which bot is better?
2011-06-11T10:33:18  <antimatroid> coudl we decrease the size of the maps?
2011-06-11T10:33:20  <antimatroid> in other word
2011-06-11T10:33:21  <antimatroid> s
2011-06-11T10:34:30  <george1914> i had slight dissappointment in tron ...
2011-06-11T10:34:43  <george1914> maps finished small, in order to spped up games
2011-06-11T10:34:49  <george1914> 'speed'
2011-06-11T10:34:49  <antimatroid> yeah i hated that
2011-06-11T10:34:53  <antimatroid> and they weren't random enough
2011-06-11T10:35:04  <george1914> but i had tried a clever 'long range win spotting' method
2011-06-11T10:35:06  <antimatroid> we built out bot with tests on 50x50 maps
2011-06-11T10:35:20  <george1914> that would have done well against minimax bots
2011-06-11T10:35:31  <george1914> but hey, nothing is perfect
2011-06-11T10:35:41  <antimatroid> that's one of my biggest requests, if we say something needs to be general enough for "whatever" then the final contest needs to meet that level of generality
2011-06-11T10:35:48  <antimatroid> otherwise it comes down to who made the best assumptions
2011-06-11T10:35:59  <george1914> yes
2011-06-11T10:36:27  <antimatroid> but, i've been pretty happy with both contests
2011-06-11T10:36:36  <antimatroid> a1k0n and bocsi were clear winners
2011-06-11T10:36:39  <george1914> they were brilliant
2011-06-11T10:36:47  <george1914> (the contest, and the players :)
2011-06-11T10:36:52  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-11T10:36:55  <antimatroid> tron was my favourite
2011-06-11T10:37:06  <antimatroid> planet wars was a great problem, but almost impenetrably from an ai point of view
2011-06-11T10:37:19  <george1914> they were both good
2011-06-11T10:37:32  <george1914> but in both cases i tried 'clever' ai tricks
2011-06-11T10:37:47  <george1914> and though otehrs must be doing the same (because they were beating me)
2011-06-11T10:37:57  <antimatroid> what clever ai tricks did you use in pw?
2011-06-11T10:38:08  <antimatroid> i used a very horribly buggy game tree
2011-06-11T10:38:31  <george1914> and then, i was surprised and slightly dissappointed when i found others had beaten me by more efficient 'standard' methods
2011-06-11T10:38:41  <george1914> i had hoped that clever methods would win
2011-06-11T10:38:52  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if my methods count as clever
2011-06-11T10:39:02  <antimatroid> i try to throw everything i can at the problems from a game theory perspective
2011-06-11T10:39:07  *** stocha <stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-11T10:39:13  <george1914> (ok the winners on both cases did some smart stuff - but not that different from others)
2011-06-11T10:39:34  <george1914> well, i tried neural net for position evaluation
2011-06-11T10:39:55  <george1914> and minimisation methods for picking my parameters
2011-06-11T10:40:19  <antimatroid> i had big plans for move selection
2011-06-11T10:40:20  <george1914> (play bots, and combine the parameters from the best bots, to produce offspring)  etc
2011-06-11T10:40:39  <george1914> aha?
2011-06-11T10:40:40  <antimatroid> trying to set it up as some kind of linear program, so you could use simplex to iterate towards the optimal solution
2011-06-11T10:40:46  <antimatroid> but never got there
2011-06-11T10:40:50  <george1914> this is for PW?
2011-06-11T10:40:55  <antimatroid> i tried using dynamic programming for move selection too
2011-06-11T10:40:56  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-11T10:41:01  <george1914> right
2011-06-11T10:41:02  <antimatroid> really it needed to be an integer program too
2011-06-11T10:42:04  <george1914> so what stopped you?
2011-06-11T10:42:20  <george1914> technical issues,  or theory,  or exams?
2011-06-11T10:42:22  <george1914> :)
2011-06-11T10:42:23  <antimatroid> time
2011-06-11T10:42:26  <antimatroid> contrainsts
2011-06-11T10:42:27  <george1914> aha
2011-06-11T10:42:35  <antimatroid> 1 second doesn't give you much
2011-06-11T10:42:46  <george1914> oh, right, machine time
2011-06-11T10:42:50  <antimatroid> i was also doing 5 units and attending measure theory classes :P
2011-06-11T10:43:09  <george1914> i would not have expected that to be such a problem ...
2011-06-11T10:43:34  <george1914> that is - if you couldnt do it in 1s, i doubt you could do it in 10s either?
2011-06-11T10:43:44  <antimatroid> probably not
2011-06-11T10:43:48  <george1914> ok
2011-06-11T10:43:51  <antimatroid> but i ended up not doing it :P
2011-06-11T10:44:08  <antimatroid> i tried doing game trees or matrices
2011-06-11T10:44:13  <george1914> in that case it is nearer to 'theoretical' imo
2011-06-11T10:44:17  <george1914> aha?
2011-06-11T10:44:18  <antimatroid> ended up finding it easier to iteratively generate tree's
2011-06-11T10:44:33  <antimatroid> just keep a queue of extendable non-terminal nodes
2011-06-11T10:44:42  <antimatroid> and extend nodes as long as you want
2011-06-11T10:44:58  <george1914> right, i think i should go do some stuff ...
2011-06-11T10:45:02  <antimatroid> turn it into a priority queue if you're into that kind of thing
2011-06-11T10:45:03  <george1914> nice chatting with you
2011-06-11T10:45:13  <antimatroid> yep, see ya
2011-06-11T10:45:16  <george1914> thanks for the info on the game specs
2011-06-11T10:45:20  <antimatroid> np
2011-06-11T10:45:43  <george1914> btw - are there any minor tasks a semi-competent c++ person like me can help with?
2011-06-11T10:46:04  <george1914> if there were, i could volunteer ...
2011-06-11T10:46:12  <george1914> also eg website edits etc
2011-06-11T10:46:16  <george1914> ?
2011-06-11T10:46:27  <antimatroid> website edits etc. talk to amstan about
2011-06-11T10:46:34  <antimatroid> there isn't really anything to do c++ wise :(
2011-06-11T10:46:38  <george1914> aha
2011-06-11T10:46:42  <antimatroid> i have had to learn python to do stuff
2011-06-11T10:46:56  <george1914> yes, i feared that mightbe the case
2011-06-11T10:47:26  <george1914> well, thanks again.   see you around.
2011-06-11T10:47:29  <antimatroid> you could work on the strategy guide :P
2011-06-11T10:47:35  <george1914> and good luck in the cempetition when it starts
2011-06-11T10:47:43  <george1914> ah, strategy guide?
2011-06-11T10:47:48  <george1914> that i could do
2011-06-11T10:47:56  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Strategy-Guide
2011-06-11T10:47:58  <george1914> similar to the ones from the last 2 contests?
2011-06-11T10:48:05  <antimatroid> yeah, that's what i started a while ago
2011-06-11T10:48:09  <antimatroid> it's very rough
2011-06-11T10:48:52  <george1914> what is covered looks good
2011-06-11T10:50:02  <mcstar> i spilled blood: http://users.hszk.bme.hu/~pf650/screenie.mp4
2011-06-11T10:50:13  <stocha> ?
2011-06-11T10:51:18  <stocha> fullfood map ?
2011-06-11T10:51:41  <mcstar> yep
2011-06-11T10:52:01  <mcstar> nice isnt it?
2011-06-11T10:52:17  <antimatroid> godamnit!
2011-06-11T10:52:21  <stocha> dunnow. i already tryed it.
2011-06-11T10:52:22  <antimatroid> i can't view the tron games
2011-06-11T10:52:24  <antimatroid> i don't know why
2011-06-11T10:52:26  <antimatroid> it makes me sad
2011-06-11T10:52:48  <stocha> in fact, i made 80% food map also. 256x256. to stress test my simplest bot.
2011-06-11T10:52:57  *** UncleVasya <UncleVasya!kvirc@46.133.108.75> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-11T10:53:12  <mcstar> its a stress-test for my engine, and it works now, can handle food
2011-06-11T10:53:23  <mcstar> there was a bug before, but now its ok
2011-06-11T10:53:37  <stocha> you have your own engine ?
2011-06-11T10:53:41  <mcstar> yep
2011-06-11T10:53:54  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you asked who is imagine, its me, why?
2011-06-11T10:53:55  <stocha> what map generator will use in there ?
2011-06-11T10:54:09  <mcstar> i just load the official maps
2011-06-11T10:54:47  *** _0x47 <_0x47!~slash@p5B12F1F8.dip.t-dialin.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-06-11T10:55:04  <stocha> why use your own engine ?
2011-06-11T10:55:22  <UncleVasya> mcstar: Hungary, Lisp... I thought that it's possibly Him.
2011-06-11T10:55:28  <mcstar> gain programming experience, and for faster testing
2011-06-11T10:55:36  <mcstar> no
2011-06-11T10:55:41  <stocha> what testing feature will you add ?
2011-06-11T10:55:44  <mcstar> btw theres a Hungry bot lol
2011-06-11T10:57:19  <mcstar> stocha: i was considering GP but i changed my mind, i wont do that, the engine waS developed to facilitate that
2011-06-11T10:58:49  <stocha> mgngn ?
2011-06-11T11:00:31  <mcstar> theres awful lot of consonants in that word
2011-06-11T11:00:49  <mcstar> what does it mean?
2011-06-11T11:02:31  <stocha> where is the standard implementation of hashmap in c standard libraries ?
2011-06-11T11:03:01  <stocha> mcstar: its basically a grunt, with a "?"
2011-06-11T11:03:20  <mcstar> oh
2011-06-11T11:03:31  <stocha> so you can resume it to "?" i suppose.
2011-06-11T11:03:45  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-11T11:03:56  <stocha> or . Mm, interesting, i wonder what more there is to it.
2011-06-11T11:04:05  <stocha> that's closer i think.
2011-06-11T11:04:08  <mcstar> i get it
2011-06-11T11:04:24  <mcstar> do you want me to answer that "grunt"?
2011-06-11T11:04:24  <stocha> acually, you can also write it ngngm if you want.
2011-06-11T11:04:31  <stocha> sure :)
2011-06-11T11:04:32  <mcstar> or do they at all?
2011-06-11T11:04:47  <stocha> uh ?
2011-06-11T11:04:58  <stocha> do whom at all what ?
2011-06-11T11:05:02  <mcstar> i dont know if its customary to answer grunts at all
2011-06-11T11:05:04  <mcstar> is it?
2011-06-11T11:05:12  <stocha> what's customary ?
2011-06-11T11:05:26  <mcstar> do they usually do that
2011-06-11T11:05:32  <mcstar> = customary
2011-06-11T11:05:43  <stocha> grunt are great. my less than childs use it everytime with great sucess :)
2011-06-11T11:05:50  <stocha> so did my dog.
2011-06-11T11:05:59  <stocha> less than 2 years childs
2011-06-11T11:06:04  <mcstar> thats new, didnt know dogs grunt
2011-06-11T11:06:17  <stocha> well, they make sounds.
2011-06-11T11:06:55  <mcstar> back to track: is there a specific question i need to answer?
2011-06-11T11:06:58  <stocha> my dog used to says ; arrwwghwaaaahhmm.
2011-06-11T11:07:19  <stocha> wich means, it's not that i'm bored, but i'll accept any suggestion at doing something. Maybe going out ?
2011-06-11T11:07:36  <mcstar> very educational :D
2011-06-11T11:07:49  <stocha> mcstar: what are the debugging utilities of your engine ? :)
2011-06-11T11:08:02  <mcstar> print
2011-06-11T11:08:05  <mcstar> :D
2011-06-11T11:08:23  <stocha> basic prints ? doesn't the official engine allow that ?
2011-06-11T11:08:40  <mcstar> i dont know, i didnt look at it
2011-06-11T11:08:47  <stocha> ah okay.
2011-06-11T11:09:04  <mcstar> its python, and its too complex for me
2011-06-11T11:09:06  <stocha> i build a graphical debugging engine.
2011-06-11T11:09:13  <stocha> i'm a bit disapointed at the result.
2011-06-11T11:09:26  <stocha> but it enabled me not to look inside the official stuff :p
2011-06-11T11:09:28  <mcstar> what do you mean exactly by debugginh?
2011-06-11T11:09:47  <stocha> you known, finding unwanted behaviors and features.
2011-06-11T11:09:48  <mcstar> debugging as a compiler or interpreter does?
2011-06-11T11:10:12  <stocha> it seems that i missed an important undesired feature though. like nothing work with map size = 65
2011-06-11T11:10:33  <stocha> i never tested map size = 65 for some reason. Or if i did, i took the wrong conclusion out of it.
2011-06-11T11:10:34  <mcstar> cause of course, i can debug my bot in my engine
2011-06-11T11:11:15  <mcstar> im on the way of being that cooperative, that i only need to load a file with class definitions from my bot into the engine and thats all
2011-06-11T11:11:26  <stocha> the point was : if people add some features to their own engine, maybe we should tell it to the official team. so they can add it to the official one.
2011-06-11T11:11:45  <mcstar> im not going into that direction
2011-06-11T11:11:59  <mcstar> i dont want to extend its functionality
2011-06-11T11:12:33  <stocha> i think some basic debugging features are needed into the official engine.
2011-06-11T11:12:46  <stocha> but i didn't look to hard at it. so can't make suggestion :p
2011-06-11T11:13:21  <mcstar> well, since i wrote my code,i pretty much know what happens for what reason, so i dont need "debugging features"
2011-06-11T11:14:02  <mcstar> now im going to develop path finding
2011-06-11T11:14:07  <mcstar> gonna be interesting
2011-06-11T11:14:28  <mcstar> oh, and the ant can see the whole map for the time being
2011-06-11T11:14:49  <mcstar> the fog of war is not implemented yet
2011-06-11T11:14:51  <stocha> anyone knows where the standard hashmap in c standard lib hides ?
2011-06-11T11:15:13  <mcstar> i can develop pathfinding and even battle strategies before that
2011-06-11T11:15:36  <mcstar> what is that?
2011-06-11T11:15:51  <mcstar> hashmap?
2011-06-11T11:16:06  <mcstar> function-names vs. code?
2011-06-11T11:16:36  <mcstar> i should have written address of code
2011-06-11T11:17:02  <stocha> hashmap like binding a String value with a value.
2011-06-11T11:17:19  <mcstar> ok
2011-06-11T11:17:28  <mcstar> static string associations
2011-06-11T11:17:56  <mcstar> why is that important?
2011-06-11T11:18:35  <mcstar> btw you can use strings on object files, it gives the readable characters back
2011-06-11T11:18:58  <StijnD> ImportError: No module named Queue

2011-06-11T11:20:03  <StijnD> anyone knows how to solve this?
2011-06-11T11:20:13  <mcstar> StijnD: you need at least python 2.6
2011-06-11T11:21:04  <StijnD> installed 3.2
2011-06-11T11:21:16  <mcstar> that might be too new
2011-06-11T11:21:23  <mcstar> the current stable is 2.7.x
2011-06-11T11:22:04  <mcstar> there must be a lot of python guys here, ask them
2011-06-11T11:22:39  <mcstar> alright, im gonna simulate a couple of wildfires on fullfood maps, then code some

2011-06-11T11:29:02  <locutus2> must implement it yourself

2011-06-11T11:30:16  <stocha> locutus2: yeah. goes on slowly. but i'm confident i can do it :p   Testing is a nut case though
2011-06-11T11:30:41  <locutus2> stocha: have you read my comment about the c-starter-bot in the github repositry?
2011-06-11T11:30:46  <stocha> locutus2: what if my scanf buffer overflow my int because i didn't get the thing right ? how can i know i blundered ?

2011-06-11T11:32:16  <locutus2> stocha: on the gitbug repositry you can find an c-starter-bot under ant/dist
2011-06-11T11:32:44  <antimatroid> StijnD: You need python < 3
2011-06-11T11:32:45  <stocha> aahhh ! i see it
2011-06-11T11:32:47  <locutus2> i have him tested short locally and its runs, but plays only random moves
2011-06-11T11:32:54  <stocha> but but .. i was trying to write one :p
2011-06-11T11:33:17  <stocha> yeah that was my plan too. playing only random moves. i mean it's enough for a simple starter bot.
2011-06-11T11:34:21  <locutus2> perhaps you can lock their a little bit by problems
2011-06-11T11:34:24  <stocha> what's map in gameinfo ?
2011-06-11T11:34:49  <stocha> ?
2011-06-11T11:35:25  <stocha> you track individual ants ? how do you do that ? what is the "myant.id" for ?
2011-06-11T11:35:51  <locutus2> to admins: on the test server aren't any games played the last hours
2011-06-11T11:36:12  <stocha> locutus2: basic_ant i called that other_ant
2011-06-11T11:36:49  <stocha> locutus2: in the spec isn't player an integer rather than a *char ?
2011-06-11T11:37:07  <stocha> basic_ant.player
2011-06-11T11:38:31  <locutus2> stocha: yes, the players are int
2011-06-11T11:38:52  <stocha> it's a bit misleading then
2011-06-11T11:39:39  <antimatroid> i don't know how anyone prefers c to c++ :\
2011-06-11T11:40:17  <george1914> antimatroid: sorry to come back to this again, but in the code on githun, where do you remove food squares?  (ie we see are not told a square we can see has food, so we should remove food that used to be there from State)   ?
2011-06-11T11:40:18  <stocha> while 42 ! Is it common to put 42. or a private joke ?
2011-06-11T11:41:10  <locutus2> stocha: in the maps the various ant are marked by a, b, ...
2011-06-11T11:41:25  <antimatroid> george1914: in Square.h/cc in reset() it makes isFood = 0, and when resetting state i think it clears the food vector/set
2011-06-11T11:41:29  <locutus2> but during a game you get an int
2011-06-11T11:41:34  <stocha> locutus2: you only process first char ? :)
2011-06-11T11:42:18  <StijnD> antimatroid I installed python
2011-06-11T11:43:15  <locutus2> stocha: you don't must process any chars because you get an int, only the playgame.py on the server reads from the map files, to the bots ints are send
2011-06-11T11:43:15  <antimatroid> george1914: it's also worth getting rid of "isVisible" and adding an int "lastSeen"
2011-06-11T11:43:18  <carlop> antimatroid/george1914: a possible problem is that you lost information on food that you can't seen (eg *....a....*, if you take a food you don't remember the other one), but i think that this is not so basic, and everyone should do it for himself
2011-06-11T11:43:20  <antimatroid> starting everything at 0
2011-06-11T11:43:32  <stocha> locutus2 : i wanted to put a function pointer into a hashmap. but i had no hashmap ready. and it's to much effort for me :p
2011-06-11T11:43:36  <antimatroid> carlop: yeah you have to do that yourself now
2011-06-11T11:43:41  <antimatroid> i'll pastebin what i am doing about that
2011-06-11T11:43:42  <george1914> antimatroid:  so reset should be called every move?
2011-06-11T11:43:55  <antimatroid> george: it is called in endTurn i think?
2011-06-11T11:44:19  <stocha> locutus2: i mean you only processed first char for keywords, and then another discriminating char if needed.
2011-06-11T11:44:38  <stocha> locutus2: i was goint to build a sort of switch statement on the whole string.
2011-06-11T11:45:01  <antimatroid> carlop: http://pastebin.com/XwrDEBui i call that after updateVisionInformation
2011-06-11T11:45:15  <antimatroid> and oldFood is made = food just before I clear it in State::reset
2011-06-11T11:45:28  <antimatroid> food etc. is also sets in my bot
2011-06-11T11:46:12  <george1914> ok, i see what you both say
2011-06-11T11:47:03  <locutus2> stocha: i think its easer to read the whole word and compare
2011-06-11T11:47:16  <antimatroid> I have a grid struct too, with an operator to index it with a location
2011-06-11T11:47:24  <george1914> thanks.   i guess it would be nice for the starterbot to include that feature for remembering out-of-vision food, plus removing it from State once we see it has gone?    - would be nice for new competitiors to have?
2011-06-11T11:47:31  <antimatroid> grid[loc] kicks the shit out of grid[loc.row][loc.col]
2011-06-11T11:47:41  <stocha> locutus2: i was doing just that. but you used only discrimating char, so you can build a switch statement. i would have though of it :p
2011-06-11T11:47:48  <antimatroid> george1914: meh, let the competitors write it themselves
2011-06-11T11:47:53  <stocha> locutus2: have you fully test the bot ?
2011-06-11T11:47:54  <locutus2> stocha: i have find a hashmap-implementation for c on http://elliottback.com/wp/hashmap-implementation-in-c/
2011-06-11T11:47:55  <antimatroid> it's a good way of getting to know the starter bot
2011-06-11T11:48:03  <locutus2> perhaps you can try this
2011-06-11T11:48:07  <george1914> yes, maybe
2011-06-11T11:49:04  <stocha> locutus2: well, one would have to test it. and it adds a dependency. i would maybe have tryed if it was standard. but i don't need it really do i. i can by a if( ) map also.
2011-06-11T11:49:05  <antimatroid> i even have state++ to process collions/battles etc. :D
2011-06-11T11:49:22  <antimatroid> i love operator overloading <3
2011-06-11T11:49:34  <stocha> locutus2: i'll try to replace my stocha bot wich don't really work on the test server, by your random bot, and see how it goes.
2011-06-11T11:49:45  <carlop> antimatroid: your function seem right, and i think that both grid[location] and lastSeen are must do
2011-06-11T11:50:10  <antimatroid> you can't do grid[loc] when it's just a vector of vecotrs
2011-06-11T11:50:17  <antimatroid> and i want the starter bot to be reasonably simple
2011-06-11T11:50:21  <antimatroid> so i left that out
2011-06-11T11:50:27  <antimatroid> it's already got a bunch of files :P
2011-06-11T11:50:57  <antimatroid> you can't do template matrix<bool> and index A[loc]
2011-06-11T11:51:08  <antimatroid> the way vectors of bools are done, it just doesn't work, it's really really annoying!
2011-06-11T11:51:13  <StijnD> I just downloaded the source from github
2011-06-11T11:51:31  <StijnD> should I be able to run play_one_game fromt the map ants?

2011-06-11T11:51:49  <antimatroid> from a console/command window?
2011-06-11T11:51:51  <carlop> yes, starting bot should be simple, the current one is seem good

2011-06-11T11:53:29  <carlop> just wondering, why in the site they tell "don't upload your best bot" ?
2011-06-11T11:53:33  <antimatroid> StijnD: not sure sorry, i'm not very knowledgeable on that kind of stuff
2011-06-11T11:53:41  <StijnD> np :p
2011-06-11T11:53:52  <antimatroid> carlop: because the beta server is hosted on a contestants server
2011-06-11T11:54:03  <antimatroid> while we don't expect there to be any "cheating" there are potential security concerns
2011-06-11T11:54:11  <antimatroid> so if you want to be anal, don't upload your best bot
2011-06-11T11:54:27  <stocha> https://github.com/flagcapper/GoogleAI-Ants-Starter-Pack#readme
2011-06-11T11:54:44  <stocha> that awfully like an old c starter bot.
2011-06-11T11:54:57  <locutus2> stocha: its not in the official package, but in a submodule. in the INSTALL.md its says you must do 'git sunmodule init' and 'git submodule update'. then you get it
2011-06-11T11:54:57  <stocha> i'm confused.
2011-06-11T11:55:14  <stocha> ah. i don't have git.
2011-06-11T11:55:23  <stocha> why isn't it in the main branch ?

2011-06-11T12:09:50  <antimatroid> 2.7.1 it would seem
2011-06-11T12:09:53  <antimatroid> it's definitely < 3
2011-06-11T12:10:10  <antimatroid> <3 and >=3 have incompatible things from what i understand

2011-06-11T12:12:33  <olexs> StijnD: it isn't. I switched from java to c++ for this contest, only had very little c++ exp before, but it works out fine
2011-06-11T12:12:59  <StijnD> ok nice

2011-06-11T12:13:40  <StijnD> but I might start with java for now until my exams are over and then when I have more time I can start learning c++

2011-06-11T13:14:23  <smiley1983> I'm not actually suggesting that mazes would be good to play in (I know they would be hopeless) but it might be possible to make some good maps with a modified maze-digging algo which added more loops and interconnections (and used a large granularity like the first of those two maps I posted)
2011-06-11T13:18:31  <smiley1983> the rotation and tiling code can work with other map varieties too, but the mazes just posed an interesting challenge :)
