2011-01-04T16:04:24  <cfaftw> have there been any decisions made on what game will be played for the next contest?
2011-01-04T16:05:18  <dmj111> i don't think so.  lots of unofficial talk though.
2011-01-04T16:05:56  <dmj111> or maybe there has been, but it is not public.
2011-01-04T16:05:59  <cfaftw> just curious... i was checking out the forums and the google code site, and i didn't see anything even hinting at a decision yet
2011-01-04T16:06:54  <cfaftw> galcon ai was so much fun
2011-01-04T16:07:08  <dmj111> yes, it was a very nice choice.
2011-01-04T16:07:17  <cfaftw> i'm hoping the next contest will use a game that is at least as interesting :)
2011-01-04T16:08:07  <dmj111> i hadn't read jmcarthur's tron suggesetion until last night.  although it is like the first tron, in that they have the same name, the game is completely different.
2011-01-04T16:11:22  <cfaftw> where is that suggestion?

2011-01-04T16:37:38  <dmj111> yeah, it looks quite a bit more complicated.   I suppose that it could be easier than it seems, but it sounds good.
2011-01-04T16:40:25  <cfaftw> unrelated, but does anyone know of reputible personal email hosts that aren't free?
2011-01-04T16:42:49  <cfaftw> i already have web hosting through A Small Orange, i guess i should look into what they offer as far as email goes
2011-01-04T16:45:39  <dmj111> i copped out, and have just used email forwarding to my gmail account for years.
2011-01-04T16:46:17  <dmj111> i also got tired of managing it.
2011-01-04T16:46:24  <cfaftw> yeah i'm using gmail now

2011-01-04T17:00:07  <jmcarthur> dmj111: yeah! i think it keeps the "fun parts" from tron while removing the things i didn't like about it (easy to turn into simple game tree search) and making it significantly different from the original

2011-01-04T17:27:59  <jmcarthur> dmj111: another bonus is that if i was to sit down to start writing AI for it i would have no idea where to begin
2011-01-04T17:28:18  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: cfaftw left
2011-01-04T17:28:29  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: :) i am good at that
2011-01-04T17:30:06  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: you said of the tron idea that you think your AI from the tron contest would still apply. i'm curious what kind of AI you had. there's no way a mere game tree search would work, as far as i can tell
2011-01-04T17:30:58  <antimatroid1> it would still be a game tree, it just wouldn't get as deep
2011-01-04T17:31:04  <antimatroid1> but the evaluation function would end up much the same
2011-01-04T17:31:19  <antimatroid1> i don't think enough would change for me to care about spending a lot of time on a bot
2011-01-04T17:31:41  <jmcarthur> it wouldn't get anywhere *near* as deep
2011-01-04T17:31:58  <jmcarthur> and what kind of evaluation function do you have that would work even with obscured parts of the map?
2011-01-04T17:32:34  <antimatroid1> close range combat (the interesting part) is what i'm referring to
2011-01-04T17:32:38  <antimatroid1> where you can see them
2011-01-04T17:32:59  <jmcarthur> ah, you call that the interesting part, but i think that part would become less interesting in this version
2011-01-04T17:33:30  <jmcarthur> more interesting would be trying to predict which side of a wall your opponent will be coming from or covering all your bases effectively when you can't even begin to guess
2011-01-04T17:33:33  <antimatroid1> i would personally be in favour of an entirely new game
2011-01-04T17:33:44  <jmcarthur> or what might happen when you end up having to go into uncharted territory
2011-01-04T17:34:13  <jmcarthur> and trying to coordinate your bikes effectively
2011-01-04T17:34:27  <jmcarthur> ah okay
2011-01-04T17:34:33  <jmcarthur> *eh okay
2011-01-04T17:34:38  <antimatroid1> :)
2011-01-04T17:34:44  <antimatroid1> anyway, i'm going out for a few hours
2011-01-04T17:36:26  <jmcarthur> if you could manage a 6 ply tree in the first tron contest, you wouldn't even be able to manage a 2 ply tree in this one
2011-01-04T17:36:49  <jmcarthur> they have the same number of leaves respectively, but you can prune even less of them
2011-01-04T17:36:51  <antimatroid1> a1k0n was getting over 15 layers deep
2011-01-04T17:36:55  <antimatroid1> we were getting like 10
2011-01-04T17:37:00  <jmcarthur> i had 12
2011-01-04T17:37:05  <jmcarthur> before i went uct
2011-01-04T17:37:20  <antimatroid1> and we weren't using alpha-beta or trimming or anything
2011-01-04T17:37:23  <antimatroid1> that was a full minimax tree
2011-01-04T17:37:42  <antimatroid1> although we did recycle part of the tree at the start of each turn
2011-01-04T17:38:03  <jmcarthur> 15 deep in the old one has the same number of leaves as 5 deep in this variation
2011-01-04T17:38:07  <antimatroid1> i liked planet wars because one couldn't just use a minimax tree (despite my attempts :D)
2011-01-04T17:38:19  <antimatroid1> anyway, i'll be back later
2011-01-04T17:38:24  <jmcarthur> i think a minimax tree would be of minimal benefit, but oh well

2011-01-04T17:51:13  <dmj111> jmcarthur: yeah, it doesn't seem obvious.  maybe it would be after a few weeks.
2011-01-04T17:51:39  <jmcarthur> well now i'm not sure whether this engine i'm putting together should be the tron game or the stratego game
2011-01-04T17:51:46  <dmj111> ha.
2011-01-04T17:51:57  <jmcarthur> just a minute ago i started the stratego-specific code
2011-01-04T17:52:07  <dmj111> i think the stratego would be fun to play, but in a way, both games look pretty hard.
2011-01-04T17:52:23  <jmcarthur> i want hard, personally
2011-01-04T17:52:29  <dmj111> don't take my opinion as being popular :)
2011-01-04T17:53:11  <dmj111> i think the ants idea has some promise too, but looking at your tron proposal I suddenly realized how different it was.
2011-01-04T17:53:40  <dmj111> and stratego, well, I had it as a kid, but no one would play it.. so there is my motivation :)
2011-01-04T17:53:51  <jmcarthur> maybe we could make it massively different by giving each player 100 bikes on a huge map
2011-01-04T17:53:59  <jmcarthur> :P
2011-01-04T17:54:12  <jmcarthur> it would be a light bike army
2011-01-04T17:54:28  <jmcarthur> there would almost be no point to that though, IMO
2011-01-04T17:54:48  <dmj111> maybe figuring out which bikes to sacrifice to make room for yourself.
2011-01-04T17:54:55  <jmcarthur> yeah...
2011-01-04T17:55:08  <dmj111> and yes, hard is probably good, but at least simple enough that lots of people still try.
2011-01-04T17:55:16  <jmcarthur> to be honest though, there is something appealing about that idea in that it's a game that no mere human could even play by himself
2011-01-04T17:56:19  <dmj111> those sound fun, and I think would lead to relatively simple engines.
2011-01-04T17:56:54  <jmcarthur> well, we're about to find out, at least in the case of the stratego idea
2011-01-04T17:56:55  <dmj111> the ants thing looks fun too, antimatroid, so I am not leaving you out.
2011-01-04T17:57:11  <jmcarthur> i think the stratego one is more complex than the ants one
2011-01-04T17:57:25  <jmcarthur> which has good and bad consequences
2011-01-04T17:57:52  <jmcarthur> i really want something with *depth* though, and i feel like that's something we were lacking in planet wars and maybe tron
2011-01-04T17:58:06  <jmcarthur> complexity often comes along for the ride when you have more depth
2011-01-04T17:58:45  <jmcarthur> hmm... to be more specific, i want something that will actually encourage *strategies*
2011-01-04T17:59:07  <jmcarthur> not just fancy algorithms
2011-01-04T17:59:34  <dmj111> hmm.. a thought I just had was I want the game to _look_ simple enough,  but figuring out which moves to make may not be that easy.
2011-01-04T17:59:43  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-04T17:59:59  <jmcarthur> i think the ants game stands a chance at being like that, with some tweaking
2011-01-04T18:00:14  <jmcarthur> currently i think it lacks depth though
2011-01-04T18:00:26  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-01-04T18:00:36  <jmcarthur> you can choose to make a wall of ants here or a wall of ants there, but it doesn't make a huge difference as far as i can tell
2011-01-04T18:01:03  <dmj111> yeah, I imagine a big trick there is managing what you know about the state of the game.
2011-01-04T18:01:19  <jmcarthur> i'm hoping to take this real time stratego idea and simplify it a bit
2011-01-04T18:01:34  <dmj111> cool.  sounds interesting.
2011-01-04T18:01:51  <dmj111> I'll be back later.  time to bike and play with the kids.
