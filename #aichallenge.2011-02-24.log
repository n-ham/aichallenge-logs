2011-02-24T14:00:45  <Frontier> That's the point. I'm fading between colors (and later I'll hopefully come to the point where I implement the 2nd zoom level where I would colorize the ant sprite for each player). But I can just take your color code and expand it. I think a color code looks better in the replay file than 3 integers.

2011-02-24T20:33:04  <antimatroid1> blah, c++ annoys me yet again
2011-02-24T20:34:11  <antimatroid1> i can't define a non-template function inside .cc and have it catch before a template version of it, even if the template function is declared later in .h and i get a multiple definition error if i try to define the normal function inside .h :\

2011-02-24T20:40:25  <sigh> play around with processes?
2011-02-24T20:40:25  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to make io nicer when actually using a process, so i can do process << whatever, prcoess >> whatever, etc.
2011-02-24T20:40:56  <antimatroid1> Frontier: that's for my "mega" starter package for myself, hang on
2011-02-24T20:43:21  <Frontier> I know what it is for, but it begins to sound more and more like esoteric programming ^^. It's always nice to try new ways of coding things. That's one of the reasons I wanted to try D I think.
2011-02-24T20:43:35  <antimatroid1> sigh: i want to make an "engine" for playing very general games to play around with on thesis work

2011-02-24T20:50:17  <Frontier> Code::Blocks :)
2011-02-24T20:50:24  <antimatroid> <3 code::blocks
2011-02-24T20:50:31  <antimatroid> so about D, is it easy to deal with processes?
2011-02-24T20:53:43  <antimatroid> while my process files are messy in c++, I think i can pretty much get it to the point that it works a lot like a filestream
2011-02-24T20:54:17  <amstan> contestbot: seen j3camero
2011-02-24T20:54:17  <contestbot> amstan: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 2 weeks, 0 days, 0 hours, 2 minutes, and 27 seconds ago: <j3camero> I am still stuck on getting the #$%^ user_sadbox to work in non-security mode so I can test the engine. I have to stop working for today. Grrrr.
2011-02-24T20:54:20  <amstan> ...
2011-02-24T20:54:28  <amstan> i am seriously dissapoint
2011-02-24T20:54:59  <antimatroid> amstan: it's a little annoying, but he hasn't really been needed
2011-02-24T20:55:06  <antimatroid> he will be soon though if you could prod him :P
2011-02-24T20:55:21  <Frontier> antimatroid: D goes from one experimental state into the next, I don't think there is even a 'common' cross-platform process class in the standard library.
2011-02-24T20:55:41  <antimatroid> that doesn't really solve my problem then :P
2011-02-24T20:55:47  <amstan> antimatroid: so like.. i can just imagine this.. he'll come and he'll have all these issues about things people have decided weeks ago
2011-02-24T20:56:24  <antimatroid> i don't think any real decisions have been made, the battle option is still undecided along with any radiuses
2011-02-24T20:57:00  <antimatroid> the rest has sort of been indisputable about what works best once we've worked the problems for a bit
2011-02-24T20:58:30  * antimatroid doesn't understand why programmers didn't decide to make common cross-platform process classes for languages, even if it does involve mehfort for different platforms
2011-02-24T20:58:47  <Frontier> Well we know his points of view for a lot of situations. That helps. But sometimes people - me included - get an idea and urgently need to convince everyone to follow it ;D
2011-02-24T20:58:51  <amstan> antimatroid: so... what is needed from jeff?
2011-02-24T20:59:24  <antimatroid> amstan: at some point we're going to need to pick a battle resolution and whatever radiuses (view, attack, birth) and he's going to need to be cool with what gets chosen
2011-02-24T20:59:40  <antimatroid> nothing has been done yet about how we're going to rank bots either has it?
2011-02-24T20:59:48  <amstan> oh my
2011-02-24T20:59:49  <amstan> lol
2011-02-24T20:59:54  * amstan cries
2011-02-24T21:00:04  <antimatroid> i know we need to use trueskill, but i don't think it's been played with, dmj111 ran some tests at some point
2011-02-24T21:00:26  <amstan> contestbot: later tell dmj111 how's the trueskill research going?
2011-02-24T21:00:26  <contestbot> amstan: Job's done.
2011-02-24T21:00:42  <Frontier> Do you have nightmares of people showing up around you, all crying: "When is the next contest?" "Why does this take so long?"
2011-02-24T21:01:10  * Frontier has a vivid phantasie
2011-02-24T21:01:19  <amstan> so the point is clear, jeff can't be here 24/7
2011-02-24T21:01:20  <antimatroid> i can't wait for people to come in and point out how much we suck for making the game the way we did :P
2011-02-24T21:01:24  <amstan> but it's his contest
2011-02-24T21:01:30  <amstan> what i think we need is more delegation
2011-02-24T21:01:38  <amstan> a long term plan from jeff
2011-02-24T21:01:51  <amstan> and then we could all work without jeff, deciding small things
2011-02-24T21:01:59  <amstan> so we're not constantly blocked by annoying things
2011-02-24T21:02:16  <antimatroid> amstan: (assuming you're willing to go with battle option 1 :P/s) he really ought to let you make decisions as well, you're the obvious choice
2011-02-24T21:02:45  <amstan> i don't feel qualified for making decisions for some of the things
2011-02-24T21:03:01  <antimatroid> eg?
2011-02-24T21:03:03  <Frontier> Web site / engine / ranking are 3 groups that work more or less independently right now. the delegation is working
2011-02-24T21:03:16  <amstan> and tbh i'm not that into research of the game, i would like to work on the backend.. if there's other ppl to work with
2011-02-24T21:03:34  <antimatroid> fair enough, i'm all about the engine/game mechanics
2011-02-24T21:08:00  <antimatroid> lol, stupid c++
2011-02-24T21:08:10  <antimatroid> toString("does this work") gives me "does"
2011-02-24T21:08:31  <antimatroid> my life would be so much better if that would give me the whole string back
2011-02-24T21:09:21  <amstan> antimatroid: why are you c++ing?
2011-02-24T21:09:45  <antimatroid> amstan: it's pretty much all i know :P
2011-02-24T21:09:59  <amstan> what are you making in c++ now?
2011-02-24T21:10:01  <antimatroid> and i really love it most of the time, there's just certain instances where it doesn't do what i would like it to

2011-02-24T21:10:51  <amstan> j3camero: yes
2011-02-24T21:10:51  <antimatroid> so i can be like

2011-02-24T21:10:52  <antimatroid> p << "stuff\n"; p >> message; etc.
2011-02-24T21:12:15  <antimatroid> i'm contemplating doing my small thesis this year on "optimal way to play" for different general classes of games when your opponent isn't necessarily playing rationally, or at least playing different equilibrium refinements
2011-02-24T21:12:38  <antimatroid> which would mean setting up an engine like the ai games for this, writing bots, playing around with maths and lots of fun :P
2011-02-24T21:14:23  <antimatroid> j3camero: scott hamilton == mcleopold

2011-02-24T21:19:45  <amstan> Prillicy: wait.. what?
2011-02-24T21:19:57  <antimatroid> my weekends start on thursdays for at least the first half of this year :)
2011-02-24T21:19:57  <Prillicy> yeah, it's got a bug that I fixed and I'm coming out with a new version, official for phpbb and all that
2011-02-24T21:20:23  <amstan> Prillicy: you mean the bug that i get a ton of false positives? banning them without a trace? lol
2011-02-24T21:20:36  <Prillicy> there is a trace
2011-02-24T21:20:46  <Prillicy> and there shouldn't be false positives, rather false negatives
2011-02-24T21:20:50  <amstan> the sad part is that there's still a ton of false negatives
2011-02-24T21:21:08  <Prillicy> that's the bug
2011-02-24T21:21:10  <Prillicy> fixing that
2011-02-24T21:21:15  <Prillicy> er..fixed actually
2011-02-24T21:21:23  <amstan> Prillicy: i had a user called "sweet", he got banned
2011-02-24T21:21:40  <Prillicy> I can turn off username recognition if you want
2011-02-24T21:21:47  <Prillicy> ip is mainly what you'll catch them on anyway
2011-02-24T21:22:04  <amstan> still rather sketchy
2011-02-24T21:22:16  <amstan> i'm not impressed, anyway.. not your fault
2011-02-24T21:22:22  <Prillicy> ?
2011-02-24T21:22:29  <Prillicy> first, the bug is my fault
2011-02-24T21:22:39  <Prillicy> so if you want, I can give you the updated version
2011-02-24T21:22:39  <amstan> no.. i meant the false positives
2011-02-24T21:22:51  <Prillicy> second, we can limit it to ip only if you want
2011-02-24T21:23:37  <Prillicy> in fact, it should be ip only...that's actually what the bug did
2011-02-24T21:23:45  <Prillicy> if the ip didn't match, the xml was off and it missed the rest
2011-02-24T21:24:01  <Prillicy> so your user "sweet" had a spammer IP and username?
2011-02-24T21:24:11  <amstan> probably not..
2011-02-24T21:24:16  <amstan> he's a 15 year old
2011-02-24T21:24:24  <Prillicy> sounds fairly likely
2011-02-24T21:24:27  <Prillicy> only so many ips in the world
2011-02-24T21:24:38  <Prillicy> and sweet is definitely going to match based on username
2011-02-24T21:24:41  <amstan> that's the fallacy of banning dynamic ips
2011-02-24T21:24:51  <Prillicy> you could do email only?
2011-02-24T21:25:02  <amstan> it's not like emails are hard to get these days
2011-02-24T21:25:12  <Prillicy> thus the reason I do a 3-way check
2011-02-24T21:25:16  <Prillicy> ip, username, and email
2011-02-24T21:25:19  <Prillicy> if any match, ban
2011-02-24T21:25:28  <amstan> yes, but then username matches
2011-02-24T21:25:47  <Prillicy> I'd prefer the extra bans, and then manually add legit users rather than manually removing illegit ones
2011-02-24T21:25:51  <amstan> all it takes for some malicious guy to add amstan to that list.. and puf.. i get banned from a lot of phpbb forums
2011-02-24T21:26:03  <Prillicy> on registration yes
2011-02-24T21:27:06  <Prillicy> but you can ask to be removed from stopforumspam themselves
2011-02-24T21:27:31  <amstan> ok.. i still have to think about it
2011-02-24T21:27:34  <Prillicy> not that I can do much for you if you don't like any of the 3 options
2011-02-24T21:27:49  <amstan> yeah, i know, it's pretty much a no win situation
2011-02-24T21:27:56  <Prillicy> yeah, just trying to help
2011-02-24T21:28:03  <Prillicy> I know it was so bad you had to stop registration
2011-02-24T21:28:03  <amstan> np, i appreciate that
2011-02-24T21:28:09  <amstan> i'm just depressed at this
2011-02-24T21:28:11  <Zannick> i see the confusion over my name has been resolved
2011-02-24T21:28:16  <Prillicy> if you come up with a better idea, let me know
2011-02-24T21:28:25  <amstan> Zannick: you are benjamin! right
2011-02-24T21:28:34  <Prillicy> who?
2011-02-24T21:28:34  <amstan> Prillicy: we could get more mods
2011-02-24T21:28:51  <Prillicy> yes, free labor solves everything
2011-02-24T21:31:21  <antimatroid> i also wish I could do expressions with templates, like
2011-02-24T21:31:21  <antimatroid> if(T != string)
2011-02-24T21:31:59  <amstan> ok.. so we need a way to do some kind of decentralized leadership
2011-02-24T21:32:33  <Frontier> We need communism
2011-02-24T21:32:53  <amstan> Frontier: we already have that.. it's called open source
2011-02-24T21:33:03  <amstan> Frontier: and communism is not really leaderless
2011-02-24T21:33:18  <Frontier> You said decentralized, not leaderless
2011-02-24T21:34:02  <amstan> ok, fine, nvm
2011-02-24T21:34:09  <amstan> but you'll have to explain it then
2011-02-24T21:34:41  <flag> What's the status on the contest (what still needs to be done, etc.)?
2011-02-24T21:34:55  <Frontier> Yeah, so you think we could assign people to sub-projects and name a leader that will check back with you and jeff?
2011-02-24T21:35:08  <amstan> flag: compiling your requested info
2011-02-24T21:35:54  * Frontier cannot explain communism. He doesn't know much about it. Ask Accoun :-)
2011-02-24T21:36:10  <amstan> Frontier: i think he's too young for that
2011-02-24T21:36:20  <antimatroid> flag: finish engine, pick battle option, pick view/attack/birth radiuses, set up tcp, work out how to rank people, set up website etc.
2011-02-24T21:37:10  <amstan> flag: pretty much that ^, but that's only for epsilon
2011-02-24T21:37:13  <antimatroid> I wouldn't claim to know much, but my knowledge of communism is it's about equally distributing total output amoungst the people yeah?
2011-02-24T21:37:46  <amstan> Frontier: i need proposal in organizing such a structure

2011-02-24T21:41:34  <Frontier> antimatroid: I thought more about Lenin's idea of sowiets as the main organization units.
2011-02-24T21:42:14  <Frontier> (well maybe not his idea, but the implementation)
2011-02-24T21:56:04  <antimatroid> Frontier: say what?
2011-02-24T22:00:09  <Frontier> how did we come to politics again? well you could make a lost of poeple currently working on the contest and of volunteers.

2011-02-24T22:00:25  <Frontier> Email, ICQ etc would also be useful.
2011-02-24T22:01:04  <Frontier> Then you divide the project into units that can work mostly independent and name a leader for each unit.
2011-02-24T22:01:28  <Frontier> The should be online often and give you feedback on the progress
2011-02-24T22:02:16  <Frontier> You delegate the jobs to the leaders of each unit and they split up the work among the others in the group

2011-02-24T22:03:53  <Frontier> The leader of the engine team would probably tell you that they have a solid base now, but need feedback from jeff :)
2011-02-24T22:04:00  <McLeopold> so, I'm here
2011-02-24T22:04:08  <McLeopold> Anything important happening?
2011-02-24T22:04:26  <amstan> Frontier: define engine
2011-02-24T22:04:36  <amstan> McLeopold: jeff was here for a second
2011-02-24T22:04:43  <j3camero> Still here.
2011-02-24T22:05:04  <j3camero> Was just admiring the recent takedown of the Westboro Bastist Church website by wankers from 4chan.
2011-02-24T22:06:11  <Frontier> #define engine "Starter bots, the game engine and the visualizer which work with common interfaces."
2011-02-24T22:06:13  <j3camero> Hilarious. This guy says he has committed OVER 9000 sins in his lifetime.
2011-02-24T22:06:18  <antimatroid> "protests spread to north korea"
2011-02-24T22:06:27  <McLeopold> j3camero: so, can we get some official delegation of tasks?  with powers to make "official" desisions?
2011-02-24T22:06:28  <antimatroid> damn, so many countries are revolting
2011-02-24T22:06:39  <flag> j3camero: at least it's not another DDOS
2011-02-24T22:06:47  <j3camero> McLeopold: yeah sounds like a good idea.
2011-02-24T22:06:52  <antimatroid> flag: yeah, those are getting pretty pathetic :P
2011-02-24T22:06:56  <j3camero> McLeopold: which part do you want?
2011-02-24T22:07:07  <amstan> j3camero: which parts are there?
2011-02-24T22:07:11  <antimatroid> game mechanics -> mcleopold
2011-02-24T22:07:30  <McLeopold> Game, ranking, visualizer, backend(running submissions)
2011-02-24T22:07:48  <McLeopold> web site design
2011-02-24T22:07:50  <antimatroid> tcp as well
2011-02-24T22:07:59  <amstan> zeta stuff
2011-02-24T22:08:00  <McLeopold> let's not include that
2011-02-24T22:08:04  <McLeopold> nor zeta
2011-02-24T22:08:09  <McLeopold> I'm thinking of getting ants going.
2011-02-24T22:08:14  <McLeopold> we don't need tcp for that
2011-02-24T22:08:17  <amstan> McLeopold: zeta might be still relevant
2011-02-24T22:08:18  <j3camero> McLeopold: which parts interest you most, that you believe you will have the hours and energy to keep up with being the "czar" for?
2011-02-24T22:08:23  <antimatroid> amstan: i think we should focus on zeta once epsilon is live
2011-02-24T22:08:33  <McLeopold> j3camero: Game mechanics.
2011-02-24T22:08:42  <McLeopold> Including analyzing fairness of maps.
2011-02-24T22:08:53  <antimatroid> i'm happy to just be a mcleopold group member
2011-02-24T22:09:12  <j3camero> McLeopold: you mean setting the battle resolution policy, or actually being responsible for producing a working engine?
2011-02-24T22:09:18  <McLeopold> both
2011-02-24T22:09:29  <antimatroid> there are also the view/attack/birth radiuses etc.
2011-02-24T22:09:34  <McLeopold> that too
2011-02-24T22:09:41  <McLeopold> that's all game mechanics to me

2011-02-24T22:10:14  <antimatroid> j3camero: that isn't to say give him that just so we can get battle option 1, i don't think anyone wants to do that without convincing people of it
2011-02-24T22:10:17  <McLeopold> I'm mostly worried about the backend and website design.
2011-02-24T22:10:35  <McLeopold> I really don't want to touch that stuff.
2011-02-24T22:10:38  <j3camero> McLeopold: okay that sounds good to me. I will promise to keep in close touch with you in order to provide direction when you need it, and to keep things coordinated between the various branches of effort.
2011-02-24T22:10:41  <McLeopold> Including the sadbox
2011-02-24T22:10:59  <amstan> McLeopold: the thing about backend we already have it done
2011-02-24T22:11:05  <McLeopold> j3camero: so, we've got the bot input/output and replay files nailed down.
2011-02-24T22:11:11  <amstan> currently there's nobody interested in maintaining the epsilon code
2011-02-24T22:11:28  <amstan> there's janzert, but he doesn't want to continue coding
2011-02-24T22:11:33  <jbroman> amstan: Well, I think the point is to only maintain it to the point necessary to operate the next contest.
2011-02-24T22:11:37  <j3camero> McLeopold: if you're taking responsibility for producing a working engine, sadbox is going to be your problem, since you're the only one who depends on it. You'll have to be an executive and find a deputy to work on sadbox if you don't want to do it yourself.
2011-02-24T22:11:52  <McLeopold> Okay.
2011-02-24T22:11:54  <amstan> jbroman: from what i undersatnd there's a few things that still need to be done

2011-02-24T22:12:11  <antimatroid> should we do a responsibility etherpad?
2011-02-24T22:12:22  <amstan> antimatroid: what about the wiki?
2011-02-24T22:12:28  <McLeopold> yes, wiki
2011-02-24T22:12:33  <Frontier> I would prefer a solid wiki page
2011-02-24T22:12:55  <antimatroid> okay, i'll do that now
2011-02-24T22:13:25  <antimatroid> j3camero: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-02-24T22:13:29  <antimatroid> have you seen that yet?
2011-02-24T22:13:48  <McLeopold> antimatroid: slow down, let's not get bogged down in details yet
2011-02-24T22:14:23  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'm just making the page, it's easy to change who has what
2011-02-24T22:14:28  <j3camero> McLeopold: I would suggest parameterizing things in the engine logic as much as you can. I suggest having the engine read parameters out of a config file as it starts. Pick the top three or four battle resolution schemes and implement all of them, with a config parameter for choosing between them. Other parameters are the attack radius, vision radius, and so on.
2011-02-24T22:14:45  <McLeopold> done
2011-02-24T22:14:57  <j3camero> That way we can change things in prod pretty easily.
2011-02-24T22:14:57  <Frontier> haha :)
2011-02-24T22:15:27  <antimatroid> j3camero: everything can be "altered" at present
2011-02-24T22:15:35  <j3camero> Excellent.
2011-02-24T22:15:46  <antimatroid> hence why i said to amstan before nothing has really been "decided" that wasn't obviously the right thing to do
2011-02-24T22:16:17  <McLeopold> antimatroid can be the map gen guy
2011-02-24T22:16:37  <j3camero> antimatroid: are you interested in doing the map gen stuff?
2011-02-24T22:16:42  <j3camero> antimatroid: I know you are, haha.

2011-02-24T22:16:51  <antimatroid> yeah, sure
2011-02-24T22:17:05  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure many people will play around with generating maps this time
2011-02-24T22:17:26  <McLeopold> yes, but I think we should gen about 100 for the starter packs
2011-02-24T22:17:28  <j3camero> antimatroid: if you are the map czar, it will be your job to invite those people to contribute.
2011-02-24T22:17:28  <Frontier> We have quickly thought about a symmetric map drawing tool
2011-02-24T22:18:00  <antimatroid> yep easy
2011-02-24T22:18:56  <antimatroid> people have pretty much already called dibs on languages to write starter packages for i think
2011-02-24T22:19:01  <McLeopold> j3camero: is there a way for me to get vitual disk of what was running on the EC2's?
2011-02-24T22:19:12  <j3camero> Okay, who wants ranking? I thought somebody did soem work on this, and made their own trueskill implementation.
2011-02-24T22:19:14  <McLeopold> *virtual*
2011-02-24T22:19:24  <antimatroid> dmj111 if he'll take it should get ranking i think
2011-02-24T22:19:29  <McLeopold> dmj111 has played around, and given me some functions to take
2011-02-24T22:19:32  <McLeopold> play with
2011-02-24T22:19:34  <j3camero> McLeopold: get in touch with janzert, he will hook you up with the image that he was using for the EC2 instances.
2011-02-24T22:19:44  <McLeopold> I'm not sure if he is interested in doing official work though.
2011-02-24T22:19:51  <McLeopold> k
2011-02-24T22:20:04  <amstan> antimatroid: how's the wiki page?
2011-02-24T22:20:18  <antimatroid> responsibility? hang on :P
2011-02-24T22:20:28  <antimatroid> it may not actually present itself for a while
2011-02-24T22:20:39  <amstan> antimatroid: i could do it then
2011-02-24T22:20:52  <j3camero> McLeopold: would you ask dmj if he is interested in taking responsibility for producing a working ranking system and plugging it into the systems it has to deal with? If he's just writing and contributing code he can still compete. Just as long as he does not have any special access to the prod servers.
2011-02-24T22:21:10  <McLeopold> yeah, I'll ask
2011-02-24T22:21:22  <j3camero> Cool.
2011-02-24T22:21:26  <McLeopold> We need a database guy
2011-02-24T22:21:43  <j3camero> Draft janzert or danielvf for the database, haha.
2011-02-24T22:21:57  <j3camero> Ususally whoever is doing the website by proxy takes the DB.
2011-02-24T22:22:06  <antimatroid> danielvf is out i think
2011-02-24T22:22:09  <McLeopold> Nullkuhl?
2011-02-24T22:22:22  <amstan> McLeopold: i don't have much from him yet
2011-02-24T22:22:27  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-02-24T22:22:33  <j3camero> amstan what about you? Want to be responsible for the website and DB?
2011-02-24T22:22:42  <amstan> could be me, but i'm not looking forward for maintaining the old one
2011-02-24T22:22:55  <amstan> but yeah, sure
2011-02-24T22:22:58  <antimatroid> i think the old website design would be fine again
2011-02-24T22:23:07  <amstan> ok, that's fine
2011-02-24T22:23:09  <j3camero> We don't have to decide that now.
2011-02-24T22:23:33  <j3camero> If amstan wants to spend the time making something new off of Django, that's fine as long as he can deliver.
2011-02-24T22:23:41  <McLeopold> brb
2011-02-24T22:24:01  <j3camero> And as long as whatever he's deciding with the DB works for everyone else. The DB is crazy because everybody else interacts with it.
2011-02-24T22:24:32  <j3camero> Starter packages have never been a big problem in the past, somebody just writes them all one day.
2011-02-24T22:24:48  <antimatroid> j3camero: yeah, i'll let people keep their dibs call on that
2011-02-24T22:25:00  <antimatroid> but any spaces will easily be filled
2011-02-24T22:25:22  <j3camero> Don't worry about people's dibs. If someone is slacking and you feel like working on their thing, run them over :-D
2011-02-24T22:26:00  <antimatroid> i'll take czar of starter packs too then if you want
2011-02-24T22:26:15  <j3camero> I'm saying they generally don't need a czar.
2011-02-24T22:26:27  <amstan> k, anyone: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Teams
2011-02-24T22:26:33  <j3camero> But if you feel like stepping up as a leader there, go right ahead.
2011-02-24T22:26:34  <jmcarthur> doesn't mean it can't benefit from a more direct organizer
2011-02-24T22:26:57  <j3camero> jmcarthur: true.
2011-02-24T22:26:57  <antimatroid> yeah, it really shouldn't involve much but someone should make sure everything gets done there
2011-02-24T22:27:08  <Frontier> Is there also someone responsible for the software on the server? Like Ubuntu upgrades, Mono updates, new languages etc?
2011-02-24T22:27:29  <j3camero> antimatroid: can you make sure we get starter packages for at least C++, C#, Java, and Python? Those four are the must-haves.
2011-02-24T22:28:03  <j3camero> antimatroid: if that means finding a volunteer, cool. If not, gotta crank em out.
2011-02-24T22:28:07  <antimatroid> yeah, you will have more than that dw
2011-02-24T22:28:33  <j3camero> antimatroid: for sure. More is better. Those four are like 85% of the demand or something.
2011-02-24T22:28:36  <j3camero> I forget.
2011-02-24T22:28:51  <j3camero> Who is on the visualizer?
2011-02-24T22:28:55  <j3camero> Or rather, who is interested?
2011-02-24T22:28:58  <Frontier> it's me
2011-02-24T22:29:00  <antimatroid> Frontier (and mcleopold)
2011-02-24T22:29:03  <j3camero> Nice.
2011-02-24T22:29:19  <Frontier> do you need a java applet too ?
2011-02-24T22:29:29  <antimatroid> j3camero: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v4/
2011-02-24T22:29:41  <j3camero> Frontier, do you think you'll have the hours and energy to crank out the visualizer and (critical) do the work to make sure it works with the website all nice?
2011-02-24T22:30:00  <Frontier> I think so, wait a moment
2011-02-24T22:30:24  <Frontier> this looks a bit better already: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.html?game_id=0#visualizer
2011-02-24T22:31:12  <Frontier> (the replay is not up to the latest specs, so don't wonder about the error)
2011-02-24T22:31:15  <antimatroid> um... it looks pretty awful in my browser? :P
2011-02-24T22:31:20  <j3camero> haha yeah me too.
2011-02-24T22:31:35  <Frontier> lol, i'm still playing with the layout
2011-02-24T22:32:29  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/G1F1n.png
2011-02-24T22:32:32  <antimatroid> i'm getting that :P
2011-02-24T22:32:36  <j3camero> Frontier: there's a lot of work to get it to actually work on all the browsers and play nice with all the contest systems. Lots of this work is not nearly as much fun as writing the original visualizer.
2011-02-24T22:33:07  <j3camero> For Galcon, ppaskaris spent like a day writing a visualizer, but it took me two or three to get it somewhat working once we threw the real world at it.
2011-02-24T22:33:08  <Frontier> Your monitors are too big -.-
2011-02-24T22:33:21  <j3camero> In any case, I am sure you'll do fine.
2011-02-24T22:33:32  <antimatroid> i have a 24" widescreen :P
2011-02-24T22:33:38  <antimatroid> my friend has 4, that's worse
2011-02-24T22:33:59  <Frontier> I still have to limit the width and height for the fixed size web site layout
2011-02-24T22:34:12  <j3camero> Frontier: you'll be working a lot with amstan to get that viz up and running. You guys should do some planning today or tomorrow to try to crank the viz out so that the people working on the game-playing system have an incentive to get their part up and running.
2011-02-24T22:34:58  <antimatroid> it only really needs a runnable local version for people to have an incentive
2011-02-24T22:35:05  <antimatroid> which is not far off yeah?
2011-02-24T22:35:46  <Frontier> local version? hmm. I had one - the one where you can paste your own replay text.
2011-02-24T22:35:56  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-24T22:35:59  <antimatroid> that'd do
2011-02-24T22:36:24  <antimatroid> delt0r_: you still really busy?
2011-02-24T22:36:34  <antimatroid> it would be awesome to release something like jbotmanager with the starterpacks
2011-02-24T22:37:00  <amstan> need more ppl signing their names: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Teams
2011-02-24T22:38:03  <j3camero> Frontier: what I meant by incentive was this. If the viz is integrated with the website and DB and plays the sample games that you manually put into the DB. Then the moment the game-playing loop gets closed, the gameplay people will instantly see their games showing up on the website, rather than just as lines in the DB. It will be really cool for them.
2011-02-24T22:39:06  <j3camero> It's that magic moment when the whole submission-compile-play-visualize loop gets all the links closed, when the whole system works end to end. That's what always kept me going.
2011-02-24T22:39:42  <j3camero> Then you light up a test website, submit a starter package, and within seconds a line shows up one the website. It's magic.
2011-02-24T22:40:04  <Frontier> j3camero: I talked with janzert and he imagined the visualizer and /files/ (not db entries) could be served from some amazon service
2011-02-24T22:40:29  <amstan> Frontier: we should put that off for now, i think
2011-02-24T22:41:18  <Frontier> So I would use php again and write the replay into the html?
2011-02-24T22:42:17  <amstan> Frontier: ideally the same way it worked in pw
2011-02-24T22:42:29  <j3camero> Frontier: yes whichever way you want to interact with the parts that are upstream from the viz in the data flow (the game player)
2011-02-24T22:43:47  <j3camero> Frontier: I suggest doing things the simplest way at first, just to get it up and running. That unblocks other parts of the project fast. Once that's done, you can do a second pass and change the way it works under the hood to improve performance and scalability.
2011-02-24T22:43:58  <Frontier> Ok, I don't need to dump the code that loads replay files separatly, just in case. For local use that is still useful
2011-02-24T22:44:18  <amstan> everyone please fill this out: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Epsilon-Launch-Checklist

2011-02-24T22:46:28  <j3camero> If we want to have a team huddle on Saturday where all the regulars join IRC for one overlapping hour, which hour would work best? We have people in many time zones.
2011-02-24T22:47:12  <antimatroid> amstan, j3camero: what are your current locations (state is close enough)
2011-02-24T22:47:22  <antimatroid> or whatever you call them in canada
2011-02-24T22:47:25  <amstan> antimatroid: ontario
2011-02-24T22:47:31  <amstan> antimatroid: near toronto
2011-02-24T22:47:36  <j3camero> toronto
2011-02-24T22:47:39  <McLeopold> provinces
2011-02-24T22:47:54  <j3camero> I think most people are in EST.
2011-02-24T22:48:02  <McLeopold> PST here
2011-02-24T22:48:13  <j3camero> I am mostly wanting to hear from Australia people when they think works for them as well as EST people.
2011-02-24T22:48:29  <j3camero> And PST yeah.
2011-02-24T22:48:31  <McLeopold> antimatroid never sleeps
2011-02-24T22:48:35  <antimatroid> amstan: whats your current time?
2011-02-24T22:48:40  <amstan> 10pm
2011-02-24T22:48:45  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I sleep, just with no consistency as to when
2011-02-24T22:48:56  <amstan> k.. how about 9pm.. as in.. current time - 1 hour
2011-02-24T22:48:59  <j3camero> antimatroid does not sleep. He only waits.
2011-02-24T22:48:59  <pyro-> weak antimatroid

2011-02-24T22:50:14  <McLeopold> I'm gone all weekend
2011-02-24T22:50:14  <Frontier> 3:00 am ? ok
2011-02-24T22:50:27  <McLeopold> but, the engine is the most mature part at this point
2011-02-24T22:50:57  <j3camero> McLeopold: my guess is that the biggest part of the engine is the sadbox and sadbox integration. :-)
2011-02-24T22:51:22  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-24T22:51:37  <amstan> jbroman: are you interested in maintaining any of the backend code for epsilon launch?
2011-02-24T22:51:39  <McLeopold> I've got a sandbox running, just not with the website
2011-02-24T22:52:05  <McLeopold> (and no jail)
2011-02-24T22:52:55  <j3camero> McLeopold: I highly suggest using the sadbox from Galcon. It contains fixes for many random issues that we didn't anticipate at first. Like mono (C#) not releasing its locks and such.
2011-02-24T22:53:18  <McLeopold> okay, I'll get the engine working with it.  Multi-play will cause some changes
2011-02-24T22:55:02  <j3camero> McLeopold: the other thing your engine will have to do is contact the main server to ask for matchups. You'll have to get someone to write a PHP page for the website that hands out matchings, or write one yourself.
2011-02-24T22:55:24  <j3camero> Oh and also report the results of games, including anomalous results, back to the website.
2011-02-24T22:56:09  <McLeopold> php for matchmaking?
2011-02-24T22:56:23  <McLeopold> screw that
2011-02-24T22:56:29  <McLeopold> I'll go to the database
2011-02-24T22:56:29  <j3camero> I predict that the engine itself won't be the majority of the work. The majority of the work will be duct-taping it to all the other contest systems it has to communicate with (sadbox, website).
2011-02-24T22:57:06  <McLeopold> So, it really should just be connected to the database and submission files.
2011-02-24T22:57:18  <McLeopold> It should produce database data, and replay files.
2011-02-24T22:57:40  <McLeopold> web site would be going to the database, so no duct taping there
2011-02-24T22:57:50  <j3camero> McLeopold: how will that work? The engine is running on a different server than the main DB. It's possible we *could* let the game servers connect directly to the database, but I don't like the idea of letting the engine stick its fingers directly into the database with nothing in between.
2011-02-24T22:58:20  <antimatroid> TIL some people think everything has already been determined before it has happened
2011-02-24T22:58:26  <Frontier> McLeopold, can you quickly add a todo to the engine? It would be nice to be able to display the turn at which a bot quit running.
2011-02-24T22:59:14  <Frontier> player1crashTurn or something ;)
2011-02-24T23:00:02  <McLeopold> Frontier: I've got something like that.  I'll write it down just in case.
2011-02-24T23:00:14  <McLeopold> j3camero: how did it work in galcon?
2011-02-24T23:00:34  <j3camero> McLeopold: there was an HTTP API that the game servers were talking to.
2011-02-24T23:01:30  <j3camero> McLeopold: so the game servers would hit ai-contest.com/givemeagame.php or whatever to get a matching. They would hit ai-contest.com/game_result.php to send a game result back, etc.
2011-02-24T23:02:35  <j3camero> A game result is a complex beast in ants though. You have a score for each player (but sometimes not). You have whether each player crashed, whether each player timed out, and more.
2011-02-24T23:03:14  <McLeopold> okay, that makes sense.
2011-02-24T23:04:29  <j3camero> I would recommend doing things this way.
2011-02-24T23:04:37  <j3camero> Makes it much more modular.
2011-02-24T23:04:46  <j3camero> And whatever, it's not a lot of PHP.
2011-02-24T23:06:49  <j3camero> amstan: I think we need to start using our mailing list again. With the forums it's too hard to "push" information out such that it actually gets read.
2011-02-24T23:08:21  <amstan> j3camero: People should have subscribed to the Behind the Scenes forum
2011-02-24T23:08:30  <amstan> and there's no nonsense in there
2011-02-24T23:08:37  <amstan> i would recomend using it: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=20
2011-02-24T23:10:56  <amstan> anyone know who phillc is?
2011-02-24T23:11:23  <j3camero> I dunno. Technically everybody could sign up for email notifications on the forum, but that's not going to happen in practice. Let's just make the mailing list publicly readable and use that.
2011-02-24T23:12:14  <amstan> how do we do that? what will we use to manage the mailing list?
2011-02-24T23:12:41  <McLeopold> janzert: you around?
2011-02-24T23:13:45  <j3camero> We can manage the mailing list membership in Google Groups. By default, people have to be approved by me to be able to post. But we could make it so anyone could read.
2011-02-24T23:14:08  <amstan> ok, sure
2011-02-24T23:14:20  <amstan> can i get added to the admin list on there? in case you're not available to add more people?
2011-02-24T23:14:25  <pgpaskar_> does github not have mailing lists
2011-02-24T23:14:30  <amstan> pgpaskar_: it doesn't
2011-02-24T23:14:31  <j3camero> It's just that the mailing list is really good for managing a project where different people are working on different parts. I'm looking for a way to push regular updates on what's happening to all the contributors so people know where we are at.
2011-02-24T23:14:41  <McLeopold> contestbot later tell janzert: I'm looking for a virtual disk of the EC2 instances.  email my nick at gmail.
2011-02-24T23:14:41  <contestbot> McLeopold: Aye, aye, sir
2011-02-24T23:14:57  <McLeopold> j3camero: if github's got something, that would be nicer
2011-02-24T23:14:59  <j3camero> I love contestbot.
2011-02-24T23:15:30  <j3camero> McLeopold: fair enough. For now, there is a fair existing membership on the existing mailing list. So that's a good place to start for now.
2011-02-24T23:15:35  <pgpaskar_> hmm no it doesnt
2011-02-24T23:15:41  <pgpaskar_> i thought it did maybe i was thinking of soruceforge
2011-02-24T23:15:46  <j3camero> McLeopold: but yeah we could just move to whatever github has and add all the emails.
2011-02-24T23:16:11  <McLeopold> Okay, I'm out for the evening.  I've got my todo list.
2011-02-24T23:16:36  <McLeopold> And I'm going to miss the Saturday powwow.
2011-02-24T23:16:49  <McLeopold> just check github for my updates
