2011-09-03T14:58:52  <antimatroid> or that :P
2011-09-03T14:59:07  <jmcarthur> in agda-mode, i can just type \circ :)
2011-09-03T14:59:24  <jmcarthur> or \comp

2011-09-03T15:00:41  <jmcarthur> at one time i had pulled that input mode out to other emacs modes, but i don't remember how anymore
2011-09-03T15:02:34  <antimatroid> this is all fairly pointless anyway, the number of bijections between a game explodes as the number of players and strategies increase, but I have a better way for finding them anyway I think, just want to implement this stuff anyway

2011-09-03T15:05:33  <jmcarthur> i admit i don't really understand what the algorithm does
2011-09-03T15:05:52  <antimatroid> do you know the algorithm to lexicographically iterate through S_n?
2011-09-03T15:05:58  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Systematic_generation_of_all_permutations
2011-09-03T15:06:05  <antimatroid> it's a generalisation of that
2011-09-03T15:06:35  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-09-03T15:06:41  <antimatroid> where I only want a subgroup of S_n which maps between players of two games that have the same number of strategies
2011-09-03T15:06:46  <jmcarthur> it's even easier than i thought in haskell then
2011-09-03T15:07:04  <jmcarthur> just use the permutations function to get a lazy list of permutations :D
2011-09-03T15:07:30  <antimatroid> I imagine the permutations function is that?
2011-09-03T15:07:51  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure what the algorithm is, but i know it's lazy (doesn't generate all permutations at once)
2011-09-03T15:08:06  <jmcarthur> and i know it doesn't duplicate work unnecessarily
2011-09-03T15:08:16  <jmcarthur> well
2011-09-03T15:08:20  <jmcarthur> i don't know that, actually
2011-09-03T15:08:24  <jmcarthur> it might not be that efficient algorithm
2011-09-03T15:08:49  <jmcarthur> ah, indeed it seems not to be
2011-09-03T15:08:50  <antimatroid> yeah this will iterate from the identity through the elements lexicographically (and I wrap around at the end back to the identity) so you can generate it without repeats
2011-09-03T15:08:55  <antimatroid> hmm okay :\
2011-09-03T15:09:05  <jmcarthur> well, it doesn't repeat

2011-09-03T15:09:22  <jmcarthur> but i just tested in ghci and it slows down as you go, when there are tons of permutations at least
2011-09-03T15:10:03  <antimatroid> my bijections are pretty much a semidirect product, but I can't quite get it defined as such when I treat plays strategy sets as sets rather than just Z_di

2011-09-03T15:10:48  <antimatroid> if I have d strategies for each player there's (n!)(n)(d!) game bijections :|
2011-09-03T15:10:48  <jmcarthur> i realize that, but i mean it gets slower and slower at generating each next permutation for the same inut set
2011-09-03T15:10:51  <jmcarthur> *input
2011-09-03T15:10:55  <antimatroid> ah yeah okay
2011-09-03T15:11:32  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-09-03T15:11:40  <jmcarthur> maybe i jumped the gun there
2011-09-03T15:11:44  <jmcarthur> i'll just look at the source
2011-09-03T15:12:36  <kire> tratie men keyboard kapotgemept
2011-09-03T15:12:40  <antimatroid> i have an alternative idea for testing ordinal equivalence where the "number of cases" increases the further players ordinal preferences over the strategy space is from a partial order (it's a weak order)
2011-09-03T15:13:01  <kire> ignore that
2011-09-03T15:13:40  <antimatroid> which is basically take an ordered copy of the strategy space for each player then start matching up strategies until you get a contradiction
2011-09-03T15:14:29  <antimatroid> you can do something similar for cardinal equivalence and keeping a min/max for a_i and b_i for the strictly monotonic linear transformation
2011-09-03T15:14:34  <jmcarthur> i don't understand this permutations function :(
2011-09-03T15:14:47  <antimatroid> link?
2011-09-03T15:15:01  <jmcarthur> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base-4.4.0.0/src/Data-List.html#permutations
2011-09-03T15:15:17  <jmcarthur> it does look like an algorithm that is insufficiently incremental
2011-09-03T15:15:37  <antimatroid> ... and that's why I don't use haskell (yet) as I don't understand it :P
2011-09-03T15:15:42  <jmcarthur> it can lazily generate the permutations, but it seems to get slower as you go
2011-09-03T15:15:58  <jmcarthur> oh it's not the code i don't understand. it's just the algorithm
2011-09-03T15:16:11  <antimatroid> yeah, I was stating that for me :)
2011-09-03T15:16:33  <antimatroid> ummm.. can you in some way tell a list to generate iteratively lazily and it'll assume you are going to access it iteratively?
2011-09-03T15:16:44  <antimatroid> cause then you could do this other algorithm for iterating through them
2011-09-03T15:17:43  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-09-03T15:17:47  <jmcarthur> that's basically the default
2011-09-03T15:18:10  <jmcarthur> the algorithm you have seems to rely on mutation, though i suspect there may be a purely functional variant
2011-09-03T15:18:20  <jmcarthur> or you could just use mutation behind the scenes
2011-09-03T15:18:30  <antimatroid> what's mutation?
2011-09-03T15:18:38  <jmcarthur> destructive assignment
2011-09-03T15:19:03  <jmcarthur> overwriting one value with another
2011-09-03T15:19:12  <antimatroid> ah yeah okay

2011-09-03T15:20:33  <antimatroid> I think i'm basically saying my subgroup of Sn is isomorphic to (S_d1x...S_dn)x(...) where each d1 = ... = dn for each () part :\
2011-09-03T15:20:58  <antimatroid> then using a partition of the player sets to cycle through each (Sd1x...xSdn
2011-09-03T15:21:32  <jmcarthur> that sounds very large
2011-09-03T15:22:04  <antimatroid> it's HUGE, but I have alternative ideas for constructing a bijection based on orderings of the strategy sets from players preferences :)
2011-09-03T15:22:54  <jmcarthur> i had this elaborate plan for my bot, but i've lost interest since things are moving so slowly

2011-09-03T15:23:08  <antimatroid> but i at least need a way for testing ordinal equivalence of 2x2 games (where there's only 8 possible bijections) so I can count the number of equivalence classes for structurally different 2x2 games based on ordinal equivalence of players utility functions :\
2011-09-03T15:23:19  <antimatroid> this isn't for the ai contest, this is for my honours thesis :)
2011-09-03T15:23:25  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-09-03T15:23:29  <jmcarthur> fine then
2011-09-03T15:24:33  <antimatroid> hopefully the contest gets finished, but i have neither the time nor the ability to fix what needs fixing :\
2011-09-03T15:24:53  <antimatroid> although at this rate i'm beginning to hope it doesn't get fixed until i finish uni for the year :P
2011-09-03T15:24:58  <antimatroid> so i can actually compete
2011-09-03T15:27:28  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: are you aware that the C++ STL has a next_permutation function?
2011-09-03T15:27:51  <antimatroid> ehe, nope :P
2011-09-03T15:28:00  <jmcarthur> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/next_permutation/
2011-09-03T15:28:00  <antimatroid> i have fun reinventing the wheel though
2011-09-03T15:28:19  <jmcarthur> it uses the knuth algorithm
2011-09-03T15:28:34  <jmcarthur> err, not sure if knuth actually invented that one or not, actually
2011-09-03T15:28:58  <antimatroid> wouldn't surprise me
2011-09-03T15:29:05  <antimatroid> actually, he didn't
2011-09-03T15:29:16  <antimatroid> i think it says it's been "reinvented" a number of times independently
2011-09-03T15:29:20  <antimatroid> starting ages ago
2011-09-03T15:29:24  <jmcarthur> yeah something like that
2011-09-03T15:29:40  <antimatroid> " The method goes back to Narayana Pandita in 14th century India, and has been frequently rediscovered ever since."
2011-09-03T15:29:43  <antimatroid> that's the comment
2011-09-03T15:30:06  <antimatroid> indians did a lot
2011-09-03T15:30:35  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan cough
2011-09-03T15:30:56  <antimatroid> and basically started algebra
2011-09-03T15:32:16  <antimatroid> "When asked about the methods employed by Ramanujan to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account."" ehehe

2011-09-03T21:01:49  <mleise> delt0r: berak is right, the I try to support all formats that were ever used by the official engine. That's not a problem though, because by just supporting 'storage', 'streaming' and 'map' formats I can reuse that old code well.

2011-09-03T21:03:18  <mleise> The 'storage' replay format was our attempt to a) get a common data exchange format into the game (JSON) and b) reduce the file size.
2011-09-03T21:05:12  <mleise> If you look at the file sizes of the 'streaming' and 'storage' format you see why. Also I've added a play_one_game_live.sh/cmd to the tools to make it easier to use the engine's streaming output with the visualizer.
2011-09-03T21:20:25  <delt0r_> mleise: well the storage format is nice in that you have info about what each ant does
2011-09-03T21:20:52  <delt0r_> while you only have the state at each turn with streaming
2011-09-03T21:21:42  <delt0r_> well i will work on it soon. 3am here --summer parties are great ;)
