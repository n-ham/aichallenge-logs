2011-10-04T07:06:41  <mcstar> the one i have is in cl
2011-10-04T07:06:58  <mcstar> im just theorizing writing the next one in clojure
2011-10-04T07:07:11  <mcstar> (im quite busy, didnt start to actually write it)

2011-10-04T07:08:58  <mcstar> for the moment im writing in c and python/numpy, just some data analysis, when this project is over ill start my new bot
2011-10-04T07:09:27  <aerique> what version of ubuntu will the official server be running?
2011-10-04T07:09:46  <aerique> ah, nevermind
2011-10-04T07:10:06  <mcstar> i dont KNOW, but i guess the latest one, that is stable
2011-10-04T07:10:15  <mcstar> is there a new one?
2011-10-04T07:10:23  <mcstar> i not following ubuntu

2011-10-04T07:10:56  <mcstar> dont mention version numbers
2011-10-04T07:11:07  <mcstar> theres a wiki page that has it, or maybe its on the main site

2011-10-04T11:26:27  <smiley1983> |UncleVasya|: Hi, I think you asked a question yesterday after I'd gone away from the keyboard
2011-10-04T11:26:42  <smiley1983> about what I do when I'm not doing AI challenge (mcstar told me)
2011-10-04T11:27:14  <|UncleVasya|> Hi. Yes.
2011-10-04T11:27:54  <smiley1983> I have some other programming projects, and I think meditation is good. For money I move crates around in the supermarket
2011-10-04T11:27:58  <smiley1983> How about you?
2011-10-04T11:29:48  <|UncleVasya|> In this year I've graduated from my technical school and came to the institute  as a 2nd-year student.
2011-10-04T11:30:23  <|UncleVasya|> No serious programming except ants (ever).
2011-10-04T11:30:56  <smiley1983> you seem to have some ability then :)
2011-10-04T11:30:58  <mcstar> it begs the question why ocaml?
2011-10-04T11:31:45  <|UncleVasya|> But in this year my new teacher wants to send me to the ACM so I have to solve these small problems a lot to gain some experience.
2011-10-04T11:34:02  <|UncleVasya|> smiley1983: Do you want to get some 'computer' job in future?
2011-10-04T11:34:33  <|UncleVasya|> It's not an offer, just interest :D
2011-10-04T11:35:45  <smiley1983> Not exactly. Some of my current projects have some chance of (small) financial return. If I can one day get enough money from personal projects to quit the day job, I might do it or might not.
2011-10-04T11:35:58  <smiley1983> I don't want to be employed to do programming for someone else, though
2011-10-04T11:37:03  <|UncleVasya|> mcstar: Sometimes I read a blog of one programmer and he wrote some tasty posts about functional style.

2011-10-04T11:37:42  <mcstar> that doesnt explain it, why not haskell then?
2011-10-04T11:38:06  <smiley1983> I think I persuaded him that OCaml is a good introduction to functional programming
2011-10-04T11:38:26  <smiley1983> because it lets you do procedural and OO stuff when you want to as well
2011-10-04T11:38:36  <|UncleVasya|> yep :)  And Haskell was too obvious.
2011-10-04T11:38:45  <mcstar> how so?
2011-10-04T11:39:25  <smiley1983> Haskell is on my to-learn list. Right after common lisp :)
2011-10-04T11:40:02  <|UncleVasya|> I came here with question about F# support because it seems to be promotable by MS and perspective. Smiley said that OCaml and F# are very similar.
2011-10-04T11:40:39  <mcstar> you wrote "Haskell was too obvious."
2011-10-04T11:40:51  <mcstar> why do you mean by that? i dont understand it in this context
2011-10-04T11:41:05  <mcstar> why->what
2011-10-04T11:42:04  <|UncleVasya|> mcstar: To me 'too obvious' means 'there are already several guys who use it'. I have found it's funny to come with something unexpectable and force my friend to tell 'wow!'.
2011-10-04T11:42:27  <mcstar> haskell is anything but obvious
2011-10-04T11:42:45  <mcstar> you mean its too common then
2011-10-04T11:42:50  <mcstar> than*
2011-10-04T11:43:03  <|UncleVasya|> ok, here is one moreexplanation for 'obvious':
2011-10-04T11:43:47  <mcstar> |UncleVasya|: you wanted to impress insanemalakvian? :)
2011-10-04T11:43:57  <|UncleVasya|> I already knew the name 'Haskell'. I have met it from time to time on the internet. OCaml was something totally new.
2011-10-04T11:44:03  <|UncleVasya|> yep :)
2011-10-04T11:45:05  <|UncleVasya|> Also I have tried to look at the McLeopold's lolcode starter pack but no way I can write something that looks like bot on it.
2011-10-04T11:45:33  <mcstar> its foolish to try to use lolcode
2011-10-04T11:45:39  <mcstar> i dont think its even funny
2011-10-04T11:46:01  <mcstar> i mean lolcode IS funny, but to write a whole, good bot in it, is insane
2011-10-04T11:46:18  <mcstar> i was contemplating to use bash
2011-10-04T11:46:42  <mcstar> but i relaized that bash's power comes from mainly its ability to interface small standalone programs
2011-10-04T11:47:07  <mcstar> and theres the restriction of using only 1 thread, so that idea went down the drain
2011-10-04T11:47:37  <|UncleVasya|> [18:48:22] <mcstar> i mean lolcode IS funny, but to write a whole, good bot in it, is insane
2011-10-04T11:47:41  <|UncleVasya|> It's because you do not want to impress someone :D
2011-10-04T11:48:25  <mcstar> whatever language you write your bot in, many people will be impressed
2011-10-04T11:48:28  <mcstar> sorry
2011-10-04T11:48:33  <mcstar> ifyou win of course, i mean
2011-10-04T11:48:40  <|UncleVasya|> mcstar: Did you already wrote something playable?
2011-10-04T11:48:50  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-10-04T11:48:59  <mcstar> like a game?
2011-10-04T11:49:11  <|UncleVasya|> A bot in the secret room.
2011-10-04T11:49:30  <mcstar> you lost me
2011-10-04T11:49:34  <mcstar> what secret room?
2011-10-04T11:51:32  <|UncleVasya|> I mean that maybe you already have a very strong ant-bot but it's time to get into fight isn't came yet. He is in ome secret place (so no one can know you have it) and waiting for its time.
2011-10-04T11:51:49  <|UncleVasya|> *its time to get into fight
2011-10-04T11:52:07  <|UncleVasya|> *some secret place
2011-10-04T11:52:15  <mcstar> i see
2011-10-04T11:52:33  <mcstar> yes, there is one, but i lost the key to that room unfortunately
2011-10-04T11:52:52  <mcstar> so you have to take my word that it existed, and would have beaten all other bots
2011-10-04T11:53:22  <|UncleVasya|> oh, when I try to write long messages I must to make hundrets of corrections afterward :)
2011-10-04T11:53:40  <mcstar> humans do err
2011-10-04T11:53:59  <|UncleVasya|> * must make?
2011-10-04T11:54:00  <mcstar> (that is a correct sentence, if youre wondering)
2011-10-04T11:54:19  <mcstar> yes, must make
2011-10-04T11:54:21  <mcstar> no to
2011-10-04T11:54:37  <mcstar> hundreds*

2011-10-04T11:58:03  <|UncleVasya|> hmm, I believed you are.
2011-10-04T11:59:25  <mcstar> |UncleVasya|: just one suggestion: try something other than python next time, i encourage you to try clojure
2011-10-04T12:00:27  <smiley1983> I wrote something in Python with tkinter recently. It was awful. The function called by button presses couldn't accept any arguments, meaning everything had to be done by side effects. Blech.
2011-10-04T12:01:39  <|UncleVasya|> I think about python because it is time for me to learn something that can help me make money. I doubt I'll found clojure-related work in my region or via internet.
2011-10-04T12:02:04  <smiley1983> it's true that there seem to be employment opportunities for Python programmers
2011-10-04T12:04:29  <|UncleVasya|> I have a question about OCaml. But it's hard to formulete. Are you ready?
2011-10-04T12:04:44  <smiley1983> sure
2011-10-04T12:05:37  <|UncleVasya|> There is a lot of recursion, a lot of function calls.
2011-10-04T12:05:53  <smiley1983> yes
2011-10-04T12:05:55  <|UncleVasya|> I want to interrupt them all in one time from one place.
2011-10-04T12:05:56  <mcstar> |UncleVasya|: clojure is tied to the jvm, and can use java frameworks, and java is The Business language
2011-10-04T12:06:15  <mcstar> he wants a timer
2011-10-04T12:06:28  <|UncleVasya|> No.
2011-10-04T12:06:38  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-04T12:06:58  <|UncleVasya|> Real example:
2011-10-04T12:09:10  <|UncleVasya|> To IssueOrder function I come from many other places. Food gatheing, exploration etc. But when the number of issued orders become the number of all my ants, I can finish turn in this moment.
2011-10-04T12:09:42  *** onensora <onensora!~c@e198153.upc-e.chello.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-04T12:10:19  <|UncleVasya|> I can check this condition in every part of my bot. But it's a lot of places.
2011-10-04T12:10:51  <|UncleVasya|> I hope to insert this condition only in the IssueOrder function.
2011-10-04T12:11:51  <smiley1983> After IssueOrder prints the order (assuming that's what it's doing), it can do something like "raise Not_found"
2011-10-04T12:11:55  <smiley1983> sorry
2011-10-04T12:11:57  <smiley1983> just wait
2011-10-04T12:12:04  <|UncleVasya|> And if it's true just interrupt all and do not come back to the food gathering, exploration etc
2011-10-04T12:12:07  <smiley1983> it can check if the condition is met, and if so, raise Not_found
2011-10-04T12:13:00  <smiley1983> Whatever the exception is, it has to be something which isn't caught at lower levels - something special which only gets caught near the toplevel, where it can say "we just issued our last order, finish turn"
2011-10-04T12:13:43  <smiley1983> so at that point you have something like "try do_turn with Not_found -> finish_turn ()"
2011-10-04T12:14:29  <smiley1983> The exception might not be Not_found, though, since you might have handlers for that all over the place (maybe)
2011-10-04T12:14:37  <smiley1983> if so, you can do something like
2011-10-04T12:14:53  <smiley1983> raise Failure "FinishedTurn"
2011-10-04T12:15:01  <smiley1983> does this make sense?
2011-10-04T12:15:51  <|UncleVasya|> Thanks. Is my idea ok or this way of programming kind of rude and negligent?
2011-10-04T12:16:21  <smiley1983> it's entirely proper to jump out of a search when you have found your target
2011-10-04T12:16:33  <smiley1983> In OCaml, the correct way to do this is through exceptions
2011-10-04T12:16:43  <smiley1983> so no, this is not negligent, it's efficient :)
2011-10-04T12:18:15  <|UncleVasya|> Currently I'm jumping out with giving a function special value. I'll try to deal with exception.

2011-10-04T13:10:28  <UncleVasya> (fst (4, 2) )  is 4  and (snd (4,2)) is 2.
2011-10-04T13:10:48  <mcstar> is to access a 2d array's (1,2) position and reading its field variable
2011-10-04T13:10:54  <UncleVasya> tmap.(2)  ives a vector.
2011-10-04T13:12:33  <mcstar> so you
2011-10-04T13:12:43  <mcstar> need () for function calls beyond the first position?
2011-10-04T13:12:49  <mcstar> like this:
2011-10-04T13:13:13  <mcstar> function1 (function2 arg1) (function2 arg2)
2011-10-04T13:13:30  <mcstar> that gives 2 arguments to function1
2011-10-04T13:13:48  <UncleVasya> func1 (func2 arg1 arg2)
2011-10-04T13:13:58  <mcstar> why?
2011-10-04T13:14:04  <mcstar> thats different
2011-10-04T13:14:19  <mcstar> function2 is of arity 1
2011-10-04T13:14:19  <UncleVasya> func1 (func2 arg1 arg2) arg2 arg3 (func3 arg1)
2011-10-04T13:14:32  <mcstar> ok
2011-10-04T13:14:38  <mcstar> so can i put .'s there?
2011-10-04T13:14:51  <mcstar> chaining them together?
2011-10-04T13:15:00  <mcstar> anyway is this ocaml language dynamic or static?
2011-10-04T13:15:07  <mcstar> is it compiled?
2011-10-04T13:15:28  <UncleVasya> don't know. I'm accessing object's fields with point

2011-10-04T13:17:14  <mcstar> gstate.tmap is what then?
2011-10-04T13:18:25  <UncleVasya> gstate is a variable of type game_state. game_state has field tmap
2011-10-04T13:18:25  <mcstar> wikipedia tells me ocaml is quite a powerful language
2011-10-04T13:18:43  <mcstar> "I'm accessing object's fields with point"
2011-10-04T13:18:55  <mcstar> this is exactly what you are doing then isnt it?
2011-10-04T13:19:03  <mcstar> shit
2011-10-04T13:19:05  <mcstar> sorry
2011-10-04T13:19:30  <mcstar> i read that line 3times at least, and i read like this: I'm not accessing...

2011-10-04T13:32:40  <UncleVasya> I have Torquemada 3.exe  in pw folder.
2011-10-04T13:34:04  <Torquemada> May be, I don't remember exactly, but we have to met with each other in top 200 more than one time.
2011-10-04T13:35:06  <UncleVasya> I've got 310th place.
2011-10-04T13:35:13  <Torquemada> Torquemada3 wasn'r the last version. And there were another good bots for testing ))
2011-10-04T13:37:43  <UncleVasya> yes, I have a collection. Hazard was my main opponent, but sometimes I played vs another bots.
2011-10-04T13:38:02  <UncleVasya> So... you came here with some questions about Ants?

2011-10-04T13:40:11  <Torquemada> The main question - how to get notification about regustration on my mail?
2011-10-04T13:40:23  <UncleVasya> So you are actually in top300 :)
2011-10-04T13:40:54  <mcstar> Torquemada: you can try registering again, its still not "live"
2011-10-04T13:41:11  <UncleVasya> hm, I hadn't any problems with e-mail notification.
2011-10-04T13:41:14  <mcstar> if you really care about that particular registration ask janzert or mcleopold maybe
2011-10-04T13:41:15  <Torquemada> I'll try.
2011-10-04T13:41:47  <Torquemada> But I I'd like to do it with my old nick.
2011-10-04T13:42:04  <UncleVasya> Does it means you already have something for uploading?
2011-10-04T13:42:46  <Torquemada> Nothing serious at this time. I've just started.

2011-10-04T15:02:29  <janzert> McLeopold: so now that I can see game endings in the list of games, I'm having a hard time finding a maze_2 game that doesn't end because of turn limit, food cutoff or bot crash :P
2011-10-04T15:03:20  <mcstar> McLeopold: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/starter_packages.php are these version numbers correct?
2011-10-04T15:04:03  <amstan> yeah, i think aerique made that page, i think the vesions are hadcoded
2011-10-04T15:04:53  <janzert> python is certainly wrong
2011-10-04T15:05:33  <McLeopold> it needs a tools link on it as well
2011-10-04T15:05:58  <McLeopold> it would be nice if a script could update that page
2011-10-04T15:06:42  <janzert> it would be pretty complicated if not impossible to have a script get the version for each language environment
2011-10-04T15:06:51  <McLeopold> in bash?
2011-10-04T15:07:02  <McLeopold> we could get pretty close
2011-10-04T15:07:19  <janzert> for example D you basically have to hardcode the + Phobos part
2011-10-04T15:07:30  <amstan> McLeopold: each tool has a different version argument
2011-10-04T15:07:49  <McLeopold> okay, start with python, then improve from there :)
2011-10-04T15:07:55  <janzert> and after hardcoding the specific method to find each languages version probably a few of them break when the language is upgraded anyway
2011-10-04T15:08:27  <janzert> might as well just skip all the trouble of trying to get it with a script and rely on finding it manually
2011-10-04T15:08:29  <McLeopold> but a least we'd know which are broken and which work, instead of having and old page
2011-10-04T15:08:57  <McLeopold> it would be a nice first indicator of a language upgrade
2011-10-04T15:09:01  <janzert> it shouldn't ever change after launch anyway
2011-10-04T15:12:43  <mcstar> you cold mod the compile script, if theres an error, it spits out the version number too
2011-10-04T15:12:49  <mcstar> could*
2011-10-04T15:13:11  <mcstar> the compile method is already different for every language
2011-10-04T15:13:24  <mcstar> so the version number query naturally fits there

2011-10-04T15:19:38  <McLeopold> yes, it does
2011-10-04T15:19:46  <janzert> it would be easier than the standalone script for sure

2011-10-04T18:20:58  <mcstar> maybe give him a swiss chocolate too
2011-10-04T18:20:59  <mleise> I won't be in the meeting, but ask Jeff about it!
2011-10-04T18:21:22  <mcstar> like he is ever around
2011-10-04T18:21:43  <mcstar> anyway i hope it goes well
2011-10-04T18:22:20  <mcstar> this game is more demanding on computational resources than the previous ones
2011-10-04T18:22:22  <mleise> Yes me too. It would be bad if we had to start collect the 2000$ to get the contest going.
2011-10-04T18:22:29  <mcstar> so we will need all we can get
2011-10-04T18:23:24  <mleise> mcstar: I don't know if it is more demanding. We have more players in a game (better quality result) and only 500ms per turn. Jeff said that the resource usage would stay the same.
2011-10-04T18:23:55  <mcstar> i was under the impression that PW bots didnt use up their time usually
2011-10-04T18:24:02  <mcstar> someone might have said that to mee
2011-10-04T18:24:05  <mcstar> -e
2011-10-04T18:24:30  <mleise> hmm... most of the bots didn't use all their time, but the top bots usually did.
2011-10-04T18:24:37  <mcstar> anyway, i imagine that 500 limit will be reached quite soon
2011-10-04T18:25:01  <mleise> Yes, even simple bots can get there soon with enough ants on the map
2011-10-04T18:26:12  <mleise> How did McLeopold's cutoffs reduce the turns played btw? This could have a big impact on time used for a game.

2011-10-04T19:20:51  <mleise> I thought it was clear that tuesday is the earliest possible date. It can be any weekday.
2011-10-04T19:21:17  <mleise> (the launch)
2011-10-04T19:25:31  <McLeopold> so, I hate to seem out of touch, but when did the engine stop sending land info?
2011-10-04T19:25:52  <mleise> amstan: Did you check out the latest project Darkworks (DarkMomoBot) is working on? BlackDeath. I bet the author is writing the A.I. and knows how to work with a time limit.
2011-10-04T19:26:11  <mleise> McLeopold: !?!? you coded it
2011-10-04T19:28:10  *** okay| is now known as okayzed
2011-10-04T19:29:45  <McLeopold> mleise: I think sigh did this change a *long* time ago, I just never noticed it
2011-10-04T19:29:56  * janzert vaguely seems to remember something about only sending water location way back in may or maybe early june
2011-10-04T19:30:44  <mleise> McLeopold: ah that was one of the situations where a bot can gracefully handle both cases then?
2011-10-04T19:32:41  <janzert> hmm, maybe it was even earlier
2011-10-04T19:33:28  <McLeopold> wow, I did do it on Feb 20
2011-10-04T19:33:35  <mleise> While you both are online: I added the cutoff reason to the visualizer and added the "loop" option.
2011-10-04T19:33:51  <janzert> I saw the cutoff display earlier
2011-10-04T19:33:53  <mleise> McLeopold: which leads me to "!?!? you coded it" ^^
2011-10-04T19:33:58  <janzert> looks nice
2011-10-04T19:34:07  <janzert> McLeopold: hehe
2011-10-04T19:34:30  <McLeopold> so, I should undo my changes to the wiki...
2011-10-04T19:35:09  <McLeopold> or, we could add them back in...
2011-10-04T19:35:26  <janzert> I think leave them out
2011-10-04T19:35:38  <mleise> I know these situations when you look at somthing and fell like it wasn't your work because you just can't remember you hacked it in months ago in a rush.
2011-10-04T19:35:59  <janzert> the bot should just assume a square is land unless told otherwise
2011-10-04T19:36:05  <McLeopold> It was back when we didn't have a json replay format and were worried about storage
2011-10-04T19:36:08  <mleise> McLeopold: They only slow down the protocol
2011-10-04T19:36:23  <mleise> or is it only sent once?
2011-10-04T19:36:24  *** okayzed is now known as okay|
2011-10-04T19:36:30  <mleise> yeah probably
2011-10-04T19:36:33  <McLeopold> I've been coding all starter bots under the assumption that they would be there
2011-10-04T19:36:43  <McLeopold> land would be like water, only sent once
2011-10-04T19:37:27  <mleise> I'd say keep it as it is with only water info.
2011-10-04T19:37:31  <McLeopold> okay, land is out as of Feb 20, I'm out of touch as of now...
2011-10-04T19:38:15  <janzert> mleise: is the loop setting for tutorial scenario examples?
2011-10-04T19:38:23  <mleise> defaulting to 'all land' has the benefit that path-finding will work on an unexplored map
2011-10-04T19:38:48  <mleise> janzert: yes that's where it is used now. it *could* be used on the front page.
2011-10-04T19:39:28  <mleise> practically anywhere where there are no playback controls
2011-10-04T19:39:44  <janzert> ahh
2011-10-04T19:40:22  <mleise> on the front page i would expect a new game to be loaded though. so i don't know if it is a good idea.
2011-10-04T19:41:54  <janzert> yeah, frontpage might even be best to just let it stop as it does now. So the page will go "static" eventually with all animations stopping
2011-10-04T19:42:34  <mleise> oh right, you don't want it to be a cpu hog
2011-10-04T19:43:16  <janzert> also I'm leaning more in favor with those who think the Sign In | Sign Up links should move to the sidebar from the top header
2011-10-04T19:44:11  <janzert> it's just not a spot on the page where at least I seem to naturally look for them and everytime I haven't signed in for a few weeks it takes me a bit to find it
2011-10-04T19:44:21  <mleise> i have no strong opinion on that, but they feel somewhat confusing.
2011-10-04T19:44:59  <McLeopold> janzert: I agree, move to the side
2011-10-04T19:45:31  <mleise> I also think other web sites have a auto-login option that allows you to forget about where these links are ;)
2011-10-04T19:46:03  <McLeopold> security by forgetfulness
2011-10-04T19:46:39  <mleise> hehe, it is not like it allows to download arbitrary files from the server
2011-10-04T19:47:00  <janzert> I wouldn't mind "keep me logged in" feature, just need someone to code it ;)
2011-10-04T19:47:24  <janzert> just needs to set and check a long term cookie basically
2011-10-04T19:48:10  <mleise> I have no experience in web site security :/

2011-10-04T20:04:35  <janzert> also since it seems we're going to be at least another week until launch and I'm already getting to the point of stretching paying for the server myself, I'm probably going to shut it down and restart as a smaller instance type later tonight. It'll keep all the current data (the current filesystem will just move to the new instance), but may have a half hour or so downtime.

2011-10-04T20:11:05  <janzert> general idea anyway ;)
2011-10-04T20:12:00  <janzert> of course there had to be one that will be stuck there for the moment until another top 10 player plays

2011-10-04T22:00:57  <amstan> McLeopold: idk, did you?
2011-10-04T22:01:12  <amstan> McLeopold: do you have [ai-contest] Google Server Funding
2011-10-04T22:01:49  <amstan> aarossig: ping
2011-10-04T22:02:06  <amstan> aarossig: yeah, contest delayed till tues, we need funding/name privs
2011-10-04T22:02:41  <aarossig> amstan: okay
2011-10-04T22:02:52  <aarossig> amstan: that gives us time to work on the mechanical hit counter
2011-10-04T22:03:03  <aarossig> amstan: which is mostly done anyways
2011-10-04T22:03:11  <amstan> aarossig: my part is done...
2011-10-04T22:04:58  <aarossig> amstan: you wrote a proper python script?
2011-10-04T22:05:09  <McLeopold> amstan: can we just take the google name off?
2011-10-04T22:05:46  <amstan> McLeopold: "The AI Challenge launching!" doesn't have the same appeal to it.
2011-10-04T22:06:06  <aarossig> are we having difficulty getting name priveliges?
2011-10-04T22:06:12  <jbroman> aarossig: Just a delay, it seems.
2011-10-04T22:06:20  <jbroman> But not certain.
2011-10-04T22:06:20  <aarossig> jbroman: okay, that's good
2011-10-04T22:06:26  <aarossig> good news at least
2011-10-04T22:06:38  <jbroman> Having a stronger independent brand isn't a terrible idea if you want to think long-term. Just before a launch is not the time to do that, though.
2011-10-04T22:07:06  <aarossig> jbroman: agreed. But the affiliation with Google is a nice thing for all of us who volunteer for the contest
2011-10-04T22:07:25  <amstan> we still have the ai-contest.com thing to solve though
2011-10-04T22:07:32  <aarossig> jbroman: I created _______ for a programming contest.
2011-10-04T22:07:41  <aarossig> jbroman: I created ______ for a Google Sponsored programming contest.
2011-10-04T22:07:46  <aarossig> way cooler if you know what i mean
2011-10-04T22:07:55  <jbroman> aarossig: It can be Google-sponsored without having Google as the first word in its title.
2011-10-04T22:07:57  <McLeopold> amstan: what's the ai-contest.com thing?
2011-10-04T22:08:01  <aarossig> that is true
2011-10-04T22:08:02  <amstan> time for me to check jbroman's resume again
2011-10-04T22:08:08  <aarossig> amstan: what?
2011-10-04T22:08:23  <amstan> McLeopold: it's not the same name as the rest of the titles, it's the only "contest" left, it should be "challenge"
2011-10-04T22:08:41  <jbroman> amstan: I haven't updated it recently.
2011-10-04T22:09:14  <jbroman> Should probably put updated marks and current job on there. But not urgent.
2011-10-04T22:09:22  <McLeopold> amstan: it's a little late for that, ai*challenge is taken
2011-10-04T22:09:29  <amstan> McLeopold: exactly
2011-10-04T22:09:47  <jbroman> aichallenge.org appears to be untaken
2011-10-04T22:10:05  <jbroman> Unless I'm whoising wrong.
2011-10-04T22:10:08  <amstan> jbroman: depends on jeff i guess, but we should get it
2011-10-04T22:10:41  <jbroman> I do like the idea of having the term "aichallenge" consistently used.
2011-10-04T22:11:03  <jbroman> Though in the worst case, you could even rebrand under some other banner.
2011-10-04T22:11:43  <jbroman> (e.g. the [FooBar] AI Challenge)
2011-10-04T22:12:08  <jbroman> But getting aichallenge.org would be nice.
2011-10-04T22:12:18  <jbroman> Any other considerations are not urgent (unlike contest launch).
2011-10-04T22:12:29  <amstan> ok, i'll get it
2011-10-04T22:13:32  <amstan> woah! 5.99 for .ca!
2011-10-04T22:14:33  <amstan> McLeopold: what do you think?
2011-10-04T22:14:45  <McLeopold> well, you can't beat .com
2011-10-04T22:15:11  <jbroman> I think .com or .org is preferable.
2011-10-04T22:18:06  <aarossig> .org is nice, it definitely fits the small community that we have here
2011-10-04T22:18:14  <aarossig> they used it for the stanford classes as well
2011-10-04T22:18:29  <McLeopold> yeah, but they're Stanford
2011-10-04T22:18:37  <amstan> yeah, i think org is more appropriate
2011-10-04T22:18:44  <amstan> come one little spinny gif
2011-10-04T22:18:46  <amstan> spin faster
2011-10-04T22:18:59  <aarossig> amstan: JS spinners for tail lights, i'm telling you -- it's the future
2011-10-04T22:19:16  <amstan> aarossig: you shuld probably get on that, the deadline approaches
2011-10-04T22:19:28  <aarossig> amstan: so it does... though meh lol
2011-10-04T22:19:42  <amstan> oh well, i guess i already have my buss pirate
2011-10-04T22:19:56  <aarossig> amstan: exactly
2011-10-04T22:20:05  <aarossig> right!
2011-10-04T22:20:21  <aarossig> This is a general suggestion that I would like to hear everyone's opnions on.
2011-10-04T22:20:36  <aarossig> I am considering hosting a launch audiocast for the contest.
2011-10-04T22:21:05  <aarossig> I have a very clear voice, I can take on a "radio personality" and basically hang out on IRC, play some music, spew out traffic stats and so on. What do you think?

2011-10-04T22:35:23  <amstan> aarossig: did you not see shrek?
2011-10-04T22:35:41  <aarossig> amstan: a Ginger Bread cookie yelling "Eat Me!". Priceless.
2011-10-04T22:37:15  <McLeopold> amstan: point paste.aichallenge.org over to zeroviz.us
2011-10-04T22:38:26  <amstan> McLeopold: k
2011-10-04T22:41:47  <amstan> McLeopold: change your default authors, they're not all n00bs
2011-10-04T22:41:58  <McLeopold> they need to fill it in
2011-10-04T22:42:06  <McLeopold> a cookie will remember who they are
2011-10-04T22:42:24  <McLeopold> do you have a better default?
2011-10-04T22:42:25  <jbroman> amstan: If they don't bother to change it, they are. :)
2011-10-04T22:42:32  <jbroman> (or they don't mind being called one)
2011-10-04T22:42:41  <jbroman> Slashdot uses "Anonymous Coward".
2011-10-04T22:43:00  <amstan> ok, sure
2011-10-04T22:43:01  <amstan> lol
2011-10-04T22:43:22  <McLeopold> "Enthusiastic Contestant"?
2011-10-04T22:44:03  <McLeopold> Well, I'm bummed about the launch delay :(
2011-10-04T22:44:32  <jbroman> The gears should've been in motion a little earlier if we wanted to launch so soon. Water under the bridge, though.
2011-10-04T22:46:57  <amstan> yeah..
2011-10-04T22:47:05  <McLeopold> the gears have been in motion for 3 weeks
2011-10-04T22:47:15  <amstan> and i have a feeling he should have specified that we can launch with our own funds, we just need them back
2011-10-04T22:48:00  <jbroman> amstan: Asking for the permission and funds in one go is probably a good idea.
2011-10-04T22:48:06  <jbroman> Otherwise you might have a large gap between the two.
2011-10-04T22:48:57  <amstan> yeah.. maybe

2011-10-04T23:56:34  <janzert> personally I was hoping we'd keep migrating toward the ai contest branding
2011-10-04T23:56:37  <mleise> McLeopold: I do no string processing on that data field
2011-10-04T23:57:30  <janzert> spaces still seem to be there for the end game reason in the visualizer for me
2011-10-04T23:58:03  <mleise> janzert: he must be using FireFox. That browser always comes up with funny bugs.
2011-10-04T23:58:10  <McLeopold> chrome
2011-10-04T23:58:14  <janzert> so 'm I
2011-10-04T23:58:17  <janzert> using FF that is
2011-10-04T23:58:38  <mleise> oh the world turned 180° today
2011-10-04T23:58:50  <McLeopold> it looks like the visualizelocally.py is doing it...
2011-10-04T23:59:01  <McLeopold> meh
2011-10-04T23:59:16  <mleise> -.-
2011-10-04T23:59:46  <mleise> always look for the fault with other people, yeah. (joking)
