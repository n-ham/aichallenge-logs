2012-04-20T12:09:08  <mcstar> mleise: hi
2012-04-20T12:09:26  <mcstar> ah the performance, right?
2012-04-20T12:09:26  <mleise> good evening
2012-04-20T12:09:40  <mleise> yes, the impossible slowness
2012-04-20T12:15:32  <mcstar> mleise: wanna share it?
2012-04-20T12:15:52  <mcstar> i have dmd, but couldnt build dsss and gtkd
2012-04-20T12:16:10  <mcstar> what was the timout of the binary you sent me?
2012-04-20T12:16:53  <mleise> 0ms
2012-04-20T12:17:14  <mcstar> oh, than that was really slow
2012-04-20T12:17:21  <mcstar> i thouhgt like 300ms
2012-04-20T12:17:43  <mcstar> no, 150-200
2012-04-20T12:17:43  <mleise> i sent you a new one
2012-04-20T12:19:28  <mleise> btw you don't need dsss to build gtkd. it works with make
2012-04-20T12:20:38  <mcstar> in readme they REALLY recommended it
2012-04-20T12:20:45  <mcstar> (in allcaps)
2012-04-20T12:20:54  <mleise> well i didn't use it :p
2012-04-20T12:21:30  <mcstar> nice
2012-04-20T12:21:53  <mcstar> in qt you can only paint in a paintEvent
2012-04-20T12:22:27  <mcstar> it really hadnt occure to me that the same thing should apply
2012-04-20T12:22:45  <mcstar> i mean you relly cannot paint on widgets outside of paintEvent
2012-04-20T12:23:01  <mcstar> btw, keyboard repetition is gone
2012-04-20T12:23:12  <mcstar> i can press anykeys down, and it wont repeat
2012-04-20T12:23:25  <mleise> Gtk3 has changed the behavoir, you can paint any time
2012-04-20T12:23:52  <mleise> oh that setting is either in you Gnome settings or in Xorg, if you use xdm solely
2012-04-20T12:24:03  <mleise> *your
2012-04-20T12:24:22  <mcstar> it never happened before
2012-04-20T12:24:42  <mleise> strange. there should be a default that works well
2012-04-20T12:24:43  <mcstar> anyway, what do you want to do now?
2012-04-20T12:24:51  <mleise> watch tv
2012-04-20T12:25:01  <mcstar> i mean with the code
2012-04-20T12:25:09  <mcstar> do you want to add things to it, or let it bitrot
2012-04-20T12:25:33  <mleise> what should i add to it'?
2012-04-20T12:25:41  <mleise> it's your program :)
2012-04-20T12:25:43  <mcstar> colliding monkeys
2012-04-20T12:26:44  <mcstar> mleise: if asteroids will be a go, i think maybe i could make a debugging or local tool out of it
2012-04-20T12:27:27  <mcstar> btw, there is some Asteroids AI on the internet
2012-04-20T12:34:23  <antimatroid> i will beat them

2012-04-20T12:45:35  <UncleVasya> mcstar, hi. I missed a link to your program, can you repeat it?
2012-04-20T12:45:43  <mcstar> UncleVasya: hey!
2012-04-20T12:45:48  <mcstar> how are you?
2012-04-20T12:46:19  <mcstar> which one do you want?
2012-04-20T12:46:39  <UncleVasya> The one you are talking about.
2012-04-20T12:46:41  <mcstar> there is a version, which is a bit broken, but has nice colliding balls
2012-04-20T12:46:54  <UncleVasya> I don't even know what is that :)
2012-04-20T12:46:55  <mcstar> and the other has squares and trianlges
2012-04-20T12:47:11  <mcstar> ill paste the balls
2012-04-20T12:47:50  <UncleVasya> tired because of my study place. Not because studying is hard (it isn't) but because it eats a lot of time.
2012-04-20T12:48:33  <mcstar> eats?
2012-04-20T12:48:47  <UncleVasya> ok, you can not be boring with providing a link, just tell me in few words what is your program.
2012-04-20T12:49:05  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i have to fix something, it doesnt compile
2012-04-20T12:49:26  <mcstar> i removed something, which mleise knows wha it is, the creation of pixbufs
2012-04-20T12:49:40  <mcstar> UncleVasya: nothing serious, really, just visual candy
2012-04-20T12:50:08  <UncleVasya> ok, that's enough for me.
2012-04-20T12:50:12  <mcstar> UncleVasya: ill link a video
2012-04-20T12:51:06  <mcstar> UncleVasya: http://liquid-phynix.minus.com/ml6Gvc55x/
2012-04-20T12:54:51  <UncleVasya> by 'eats' I mean that the time I must waste for being present on lessons is cost way more than a gain from these lessons. I do regret about this time but for some reasons I must be present on every lesson.

2012-04-20T13:12:22  <UncleVasya> is it for work now?
2012-04-20T13:12:28  <mcstar> no
2012-04-20T13:12:32  <thestinger> the only problem is that I can't get it tobuild _again_
2012-04-20T13:14:11  <UncleVasya> I tried to show a will power and not to ask this... but I can't: is there some info about aichallenge that I can't read on forums?
2012-04-20T13:15:22  <mcstar> UncleVasya: countless blogs
2012-04-20T13:15:38  <UncleVasya> I've decided that next time I'll have a time to try something new I'll start learning QT.
2012-04-20T13:15:48  <mcstar> dejavu
2012-04-20T13:15:50  <mcstar> dejavu
2012-04-20T13:15:55  <mcstar> did you say this before?
2012-04-20T13:16:03  <mcstar> and didnt i write 2x dejavu in response?
2012-04-20T13:16:04  <UncleVasya> no
2012-04-20T13:16:06  <thestinger> mcstar: I think he's you
2012-04-20T13:16:08  <mcstar> noway
2012-04-20T13:16:08  <thestinger> from the past
2012-04-20T13:16:13  <mcstar> thestinger: lol
2012-04-20T13:16:15  *** mviel_ <mviel_!~mviel@APuteaux-552-1-137-115.w82-120.abo.wanadoo.fr> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2012-04-20T13:16:55  <UncleVasya> heheh, so you are looking at qt too :)
2012-04-20T13:17:01  <thestinger> I need to do some kind of voodoo incantations to get this to build again
2012-04-20T13:17:57  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i told you, i have some work when i do qt, yes
2012-04-20T13:18:11  <mcstar> i very much hope, that this weekend i can finish it
2012-04-20T13:18:37  <thestinger> wait wtf... cling has been making a .cling_history file in every dir I've run it in
2012-04-20T13:18:40  <thestinger> >.<
2012-04-20T13:18:43  <mcstar> not 'when'
2012-04-20T13:18:48  <UncleVasya> I have watched a video. Looks like billiard :p
2012-04-20T13:19:44  <mcstar> UncleVasya: yeah, some odd kind of billiard, anyway, the purpose of the code was to test rendering based collision detection, i.e. by detecting pixel overlapping
2012-04-20T13:20:02  <mcstar> s
2012-04-20T13:20:34  <UncleVasya> so you don't need to have a map representation in your code?
2012-04-20T13:20:49  <mcstar> mleise: the other pixmap leaks space too, the big one
2012-04-20T13:21:26  <thestinger> this is the scariest PKGBUILD ever
2012-04-20T13:21:29  <thestinger> :\
2012-04-20T13:21:54  <mcstar> UncleVasya: map? it could handle any shapes, not just circles(which are easy to detect collisions on_
2012-04-20T13:21:56  <mcstar> )
2012-04-20T13:22:39  <mcstar> thestinger: did you know theres a cabal2arch tool, that converts cabal build files into PKGBUILDs?
2012-04-20T13:22:48  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-20T13:22:52  <mcstar> :(
2012-04-20T13:22:53  <thestinger> MrElendig told me it sucked
2012-04-20T13:23:00  <thestinger> that's all I know about it :P
2012-04-20T13:23:09  <mcstar> thestinger: you are impossible to tell news to
2012-04-20T13:23:26  <thestinger> at least archlinux news since I'm in #archlinux and #archlinux-offtopic :P
2012-04-20T13:23:46  <mcstar> that explains it, i dont go near arch community
2012-04-20T13:24:00  <mcstar> (i mean i didnt need to, except once or twice)
2012-04-20T13:24:20  <mcstar> thestinger: the wiki is superb
2012-04-20T13:24:47  * thestinger is a wiki admin :)
2012-04-20T13:24:54  <mcstar> oh
2012-04-20T13:25:30  <thestinger> you've probably read stuff I wrote
2012-04-20T13:25:37  <thestinger> well, you have
2012-04-20T13:25:44  <mcstar> yeah, what/
2012-04-20T13:25:54  <thestinger> Number of edits:9,069 lots? :P
2012-04-20T13:26:06  <thestinger> a big chunk of the beginners' guide for one
2012-04-20T13:26:28  <mcstar> i guess thats a great number?
2012-04-20T13:26:39  <thestinger> lots was trivial though
2012-04-20T13:26:42  <thestinger> adding categories, etc.
2012-04-20T13:27:20  <meem1029> That's a lot of edits. And the arch beginners' guide is awesome!
2012-04-20T13:28:13  <thestinger> mcstar: my motivation for editing was basically disgust at first, the beginners' guide used to be ~10x bigger
2012-04-20T13:28:30  <thestinger> told people how to install gnome, set up custom whatever for $WINDOW_MANAGER, etc.
2012-04-20T13:28:46  <mcstar> i cant remember reading, it but probably cause i didnt need to read it twice
2012-04-20T13:28:49  <mcstar> good work
2012-04-20T13:29:26  <mcstar> it is much better to write it down once, than always help out ppl with little bits
2012-04-20T13:29:40  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-20T13:29:48  <mcstar> thestinger: do you maintain packages too?
2012-04-20T13:29:57  <thestinger> just AUR ones, I'm not a TU (yet :P)
2012-04-20T13:30:10  <mcstar> i had 1 aur package
2012-04-20T13:30:25  <mcstar> they deleted it some time ago, with 'useless' comment
2012-04-20T13:30:34  <thestinger> heh
2012-04-20T13:31:10  <thestinger> I don't think I'll ever get cling to build again
2012-04-20T13:31:15  <mcstar> thestinger: i patched kdeworkspace to support 'tile windows of active application' by using electric corners
2012-04-20T13:31:49  <thestinger> mcstar: the deletion process is basically 1) someone sends mail to aur-general mailing list 2) they delete it
2012-04-20T13:32:09  <mcstar> i think i got an email or something
2012-04-20T13:32:16  <mcstar> happened some time ago, cant remember
2012-04-20T13:33:06  <thestinger> most of my aur packages are things that can't be in the repos
2012-04-20T13:34:08  <thestinger> android-sdk, nessus, metasploit, a patched version of urxvt, git/svn packages
2012-04-20T13:34:45  <thestinger> well if I wasted a day figuring out how to compile the android sdk from source... (not going to happen)
2012-04-20T13:34:53  <mcstar> ah hacker tool
2012-04-20T13:35:11  <thestinger> mcstar: well, nessus is closed source and you can't redistribute it
2012-04-20T13:35:47  <thestinger> metasploit is an svn package, and it's a huge pile of source code - you check it out from svn and that's it
2012-04-20T13:36:09  <thestinger> android SDK can't be redistributed unless you build it yourself afaik, etc.
2012-04-20T13:37:54  <thestinger> and cling is apparently never going to build again

2012-04-20T13:40:58  <mcstar> i reached constant space nirvana
2012-04-20T13:41:12  <mcstar> X resources stays constant i.e.
2012-04-20T13:44:16  <mleise> mcstar: I was running. Yes the big pixmap leaks as well, noticed that when I disabled the color checking code
2012-04-20T13:44:32  <mcstar> mleise: its alright now
2012-04-20T13:44:43  <mleise> somehow with recent updates my linux became more responsive when it starts to swap out
2012-04-20T13:44:53  <mleise> earlier I was pretty much doomed
2012-04-20T13:45:23  <mcstar> i recorved some excessive swapping thanks to a real virtual terminal
2012-04-20T13:45:28  <mcstar> from*
2012-04-20T13:45:40  <mcstar> it happened with Mathematica
2012-04-20T13:46:06  <mcstar> mleise: whoa, my code is actually slow
2012-04-20T13:46:26  <mcstar> with a few objects it very smooth fast, with many, it is slow, and jaggy
2012-04-20T13:46:44  <mcstar> now slow again
2012-04-20T13:46:45  <mcstar> wtf
2012-04-20T13:47:01  <mleise> a job in Delphi, UncleVasya. That's great. The weather and the landscape are wonderful in Greece
2012-04-20T13:47:16  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-20T13:47:25  <mcstar> is this an insider joke?
2012-04-20T13:50:35  <mleise> mcstar: tell me you know the oracle of Delphi!
2012-04-20T13:50:53  <mcstar> i know the Oracle from the matrix
2012-04-20T13:50:55  <mleise> I've been at her temple, where she resided in a basement
2012-04-20T13:51:01  <amstan> what? making UIs for oracle dbs in delphi?

2012-04-20T13:52:06  <mcstar> with*
2012-04-20T13:52:06  <mleise> hehe, yea. i need a reality link
2012-04-20T13:52:33  <mleise> anyway I tested my code for memory leaks as well while I was away. Everything fine and avg. 2,75962 ms per frame (362,368 FPS) :D
2012-04-20T13:52:55  <mleise> These old Core2 are still good for something
2012-04-20T13:53:39  <mleise> for you Americans: the , is a .
2012-04-20T13:54:00  <mcstar> i hate , as decimal separator
2012-04-20T13:54:20  <mcstar> (in handwriting it is ok)
2012-04-20T13:54:29  <mleise> In D we write 1_000_000 for one million. It's very helpful
2012-04-20T13:55:06  <mcstar> in lisp we write #| this is a perfectly &**% valid indetifier|#
2012-04-20T13:55:24  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-20T13:55:30  <mleise> you are right about that. especially with software you never know which uses formatting that is ignorant to locale settings
2012-04-20T13:56:09  <mleise> then you type 123.123 in gcalc and it just stares at you in disbelief
2012-04-20T13:57:42  <mleise> in D we can use any letters from the Unicode sets, like ŸæŸø⁄Ä⁄Å⁄Ç⁄É⁄Ñ⁄Ö⁄Ü⁄á⁄à⁄â or ‚Ñï
2012-04-20T13:58:16  <mcstar> space?
2012-04-20T13:58:19  <mleise> ‚Ñ™‚Ñ´‚Ñ¨‚Ñ≠‚ÑÆ‚ÑØ‚Ñ∞‚Ñ±‚Ñ¶ or ‡ªë‡ªí‡ªì‡ªî‡ªï‡ªñ‡ªó‡ªò
2012-04-20T13:58:29  <mleise> no spaces, that would totally fuck up the parser
2012-04-20T13:58:40  <mcstar> lisp won
2012-04-20T13:58:42  <mcstar> EOD
2012-04-20T13:59:02  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-20T13:59:02  <mleise> lol it obviously supports less different characters
2012-04-20T13:59:26  <mleise> the number of possible 3 letter acronyms is strongly reduced in lisp
2012-04-20T14:00:27  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-04-20T14:00:54  <mleise> D has maybe 10000^3, lisp has 30^3
2012-04-20T14:01:03  <mleise> possible three letter identifiers
2012-04-20T14:01:04  <mcstar> btw, did you add a gtk timer? or used a ssytem timer?
2012-04-20T14:01:14  <mleise> I used the gtk.Timer
2012-04-20T14:01:19  <mleise> the good stuff
2012-04-20T14:01:40  <mcstar> mleise: i dont get it, what is reduced in practice?
2012-04-20T14:01:50  <mcstar> dont tell me you gain anything with unicode
2012-04-20T14:01:57  <mcstar> your keyboard is asciii
2012-04-20T14:02:00  <mcstar> iiiii
2012-04-20T14:02:11  <mleise> oh well... that limitation. its just practical though
2012-04-20T14:02:19  <mcstar> pfff
2012-04-20T14:02:21  <mleise> in theory you can have many more identifiers
2012-04-20T14:02:43  <mcstar> in theory, i could wait, until a thermodynamic fluctuation writes my program!!!
2012-04-20T14:02:52  <mleise> :D
2012-04-20T14:03:29  <mleise> Did you never want to write Œîx = x2 - x1 ?
2012-04-20T14:03:45  <mleise> or sin(Œ±) ?
2012-04-20T14:05:05  <mcstar> :Delta: or :alpha:
2012-04-20T14:05:18  <mleise> or h√°zsz√°m
2012-04-20T14:05:21  <mcstar> and yes, i usually do that in my code
2012-04-20T14:05:29  <mcstar> in my Mathematica code
2012-04-20T14:05:43  <mcstar> not in my c++/lisp/haskell/python code
2012-04-20T14:05:55  <mcstar> you know why? because it doesnt matter there
2012-04-20T14:06:12  <mcstar> (and i cant, in practice..)
2012-04-20T14:06:41  <mleise> It is not a real feature of any programming language anyway
2012-04-20T14:07:16  <mleise> but nice to have as long as you don't force others to copy&paste chars from a table :p
2012-04-20T14:07:24  <mcstar> in a CAS is is very useful, and well, a real CAS cant do without easy 2d math input/output
2012-04-20T14:08:11  <mleise> I'll take a shower now, cook something and drink some beer while watching people try to sing karaoke
2012-04-20T14:08:19  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-20T14:08:29  <mcstar> first3 sounds fun
2012-04-20T14:09:54  <mleise> well if I like the songs I often sing along, too. maybe i'll meet someone I know.
