2012-07-09T13:47:26  <antimatroid> ah, it will probably be 4
2012-07-09T13:47:43  <antimatroid> unless my other advisors is smaller
2012-07-09T13:47:50  <antimatroid> http://www.maths.utas.edu.au/People/FitzGerald/HomePage.html advisor 1
2012-07-09T13:47:55  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_D._Jarvis advisor 2

2012-07-09T13:51:06  <antimatroid> impressed?
2012-07-09T13:51:13  <antimatroid> i didn't expect that aha
2012-07-09T13:53:54  <mcstar> having a 2?
2012-07-09T13:53:57  <mcstar> yeah
2012-07-09T13:54:07  <mcstar> but first write a paper
2012-07-09T13:54:10  <mcstar> :)
2012-07-09T13:54:39  <antimatroid> what?
2012-07-09T13:54:42  <antimatroid> it would be 4
2012-07-09T13:54:51  <mcstar> why?
2012-07-09T13:54:57  <antimatroid> cause des is 3
2012-07-09T13:54:58  <mcstar> if your advisor has 1
2012-07-09T13:55:01  <antimatroid> and i dunno what peter is
2012-07-09T13:55:08  <antimatroid> nah, that was numbering my advisors
2012-07-09T13:55:13  <mcstar> ooh
2012-07-09T13:55:21  <antimatroid> one of my advisors did not coauthor with erdos aha
2012-07-09T13:55:26  <mcstar> k
2012-07-09T13:56:27  <Zannick> i once had an opportunity to get an erdos number...
2012-07-09T13:57:12  <Zannick> would have been 6 i think. but i was lazy and never actually finished the paper
2012-07-09T13:58:15  <mcstar> Zannick: you missed the opporunity of your life
2012-07-09T13:58:31  <mcstar> what will you tell to your children when they ask about Erdos?
2012-07-09T13:58:34  <antimatroid> i'd have to fail out of my phd not to publish with des i think
2012-07-09T13:58:51  <antimatroid> i need to get his opinion, but i think i have full authorship over my game theory stuff
2012-07-09T13:58:52  <Zannick> maybe i'll find someone within google and do something cooler, though
2012-07-09T14:02:00  <antimatroid> delt0r: any luck having that meeting?
