2010-11-15T00:00:25  <dmj111> well... this was not ready to be shared, but here it is: http://pastebin.com/yMk1i3hS
2010-11-15T00:00:59  <bhasker> your code is so much more pythonic :(
2010-11-15T00:01:04  <bhasker> my code looks horrible lol
2010-11-15T00:02:03  <dmj111> mine did not look that way on the first pass :)
2010-11-15T00:02:40  <bhasker> why does your code iterate only over the #of your fleets inbound
2010-11-15T00:02:44  <dmj111> and it could use a bit more work... but I have other problems to work on.
2010-11-15T00:02:53  <bhasker> line 49
2010-11-15T00:03:01  <bhasker>   for t in xrange(1,M):
2010-11-15T00:03:19  <sigh> M is max_turn
2010-11-15T00:03:26  <bhasker>   junk, mine, enemy = fleets
2010-11-15T00:03:27  <bhasker>   M = len(mine)
2010-11-15T00:03:29  <bhasker> nope
2010-11-15T00:03:31  <dmj111> M is the number of turns to calculate.  the fleets arrays are just the total numbers arriving on each turn.
2010-11-15T00:03:42  <sigh> nope?
2010-11-15T00:03:43  <dmj111> so, yes, it is the max turn.
2010-11-15T00:03:47  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-15T00:03:47  <sigh> see :)
2010-11-15T00:03:50  <bhasker> i am confused
2010-11-15T00:04:04  <sigh> mine comes from: make_empty_arrays
2010-11-15T00:04:05  <bhasker> total # of fleets arriving?
2010-11-15T00:04:11  <dmj111> if there are no fleets coming in, mine is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
2010-11-15T00:04:16  <bhasker> ooh
2010-11-15T00:04:27  <sigh> it's not the clearest thing in the world :)
2010-11-15T00:04:31  <bhasker> <---should read the full code
2010-11-15T00:04:31  <bhasker> nm
2010-11-15T00:04:33  <dmj111> noooo... its not...
2010-11-15T00:04:39  <dmj111> the clearest.
2010-11-15T00:05:14  <dmj111> I wasn't expecting to share any of it so soon... that's my excuse for the lack of explanation
2010-11-15T00:05:18  <dmj111> :/
2010-11-15T00:05:26  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-15T00:05:37  <sigh> I only knew because the it was implicit in the structure of fleets
2010-11-15T00:05:41  <sigh> *guessed
2010-11-15T00:05:48  <bhasker> i leave a lot of comments around, cause otherwise i forget why i did something:-\
2010-11-15T00:05:52  <sigh> I don't think it is explicit in the code
2010-11-15T00:06:34  <dmj111> bhasker: good plan.  I always end up re-solving things.  This has been in my code since the start though, so I remember it now.
2010-11-15T00:06:49  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-15T00:07:01  <sigh> I leave comments around which go out of date :D
2010-11-15T00:07:14  <bhasker> and i added like a ton of logging because i would keep running into bugs: -\
2010-11-15T00:07:37  <dmj111> the end result of the run planet function is a list like this [(0,1,0), (1,1,13), ....]
2010-11-15T00:07:50  <dmj111> the first term is _always_ (0, current_owner, 0)
2010-11-15T00:08:05  <sigh> btw, what is junk?
2010-11-15T00:08:06  <dmj111> it made some of my other code easier, where I subtract the number of ships on turn N from turn N-1
2010-11-15T00:08:06  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-11-15T00:08:35  <dmj111> junk is just so I don't think I am going to use it.  the value happens to be [0], which is a list of incoming neutral fleets :)
2010-11-15T00:08:49  <sigh> :P
2010-11-15T00:09:08  <dmj111> my other favorite in python code is to do stuff like:  ign,ore,x = f(y)
2010-11-15T00:09:18  <sigh> haha
2010-11-15T00:09:32  <antimatroid> it's hard to not end up with out of date comments
2010-11-15T00:09:35  <dmj111> sigh: have you used pythong much?
2010-11-15T00:09:36  <antimatroid> i try to comment sparingly
2010-11-15T00:10:00  <sigh> dmj111: a bit, it's my go to language most of the time
2010-11-15T00:10:22  <dmj111> excellent... the next thing will make more sense then...
2010-11-15T00:10:41  <dmj111> I did this : ig,no,re,x = ...      in some code where I was using regular expressions.
2010-11-15T00:10:45  <dmj111> import re
2010-11-15T00:10:53  <dmj111> stuff quit working in the loop.
2010-11-15T00:10:59  <sigh> :)
2010-11-15T00:11:06  <sigh> that's always fun
2010-11-15T00:11:32  <Zannick> "oops"
2010-11-15T00:11:40  <dmj111> ok.  everyone have a good day/night.  I didn't mean to stay up this long again.
2010-11-15T00:11:42  <sigh> I've done something similar before, I think
2010-11-15T00:11:44  <sigh> easy mistake to make
2010-11-15T00:11:45  <sigh> cya
2010-11-15T00:11:50  <dmj111> later.
2010-11-15T00:13:00  <bhasker> l8r
2010-11-15T00:13:04  <bhasker> thanks for sharing your code
2010-11-15T00:15:24  <antimatroid> McLeopold: all your testmaps seem to only have one "central planet"?

2010-11-15T00:56:10  <bhasker> when i represent my state as a straight tuple
2010-11-15T00:56:25  <bhasker> the copy time goes down from 7ms to 0.68ms

2010-11-15T00:57:23  <bhasker> for anyone who is interested
2010-11-15T01:00:10  <antimatroid> i just let c++ write my copy functions
2010-11-15T01:00:12  <antimatroid> is that a bad idea?

2010-11-15T01:01:43  <sigh> antimatroid: as long as you understand what the copy function is actually doing, sure
2010-11-15T01:03:22  <bhasker> copy function in c++ for most structures i bit by bit copy
2010-11-15T01:03:26  <bhasker> unless you have pointers in there
2010-11-15T01:03:32  <bhasker> in which case you want to write copy constructors
2010-11-15T01:03:42  <bhasker> in python its not as simple
2010-11-15T01:03:54  <bhasker> because everything is a reference
2010-11-15T01:04:37  <sigh> I find python copy simpler to get my head around, mostly because everything behaves the same way
2010-11-15T01:05:02  <bhasker> i guess python is just slower
2010-11-15T01:05:07  <bhasker> i wrote a similar c++ code
2010-11-15T01:05:14  <bhasker> and it runs in under 500 microseconds:-
2010-11-15T01:05:29  <sigh> well, yeah... python has a lot more overhead
2010-11-15T01:05:54  <bhasker> the tuple version of python is close
2010-11-15T01:05:59  <bhasker> but the object version is very slow
2010-11-15T01:06:41  <sigh> well, in the first place objects are like one big hash
2010-11-15T01:06:45  <sigh> so you have that overhead
2010-11-15T01:07:01  <bhasker> yea i guess, but i didnt realize how much slower object copy was compared to tuples
2010-11-15T01:07:13  <bhasker> i didn't want to use a tuple cause then i have to index everything by number
2010-11-15T01:07:19  <bhasker> and thats kind of annoying to read later
2010-11-15T01:07:29  <bhasker> so i used an object as the container
2010-11-15T01:07:45  <bhasker> thinking c++
2010-11-15T01:07:55  <bhasker> since in c++ all the lookup overhead is optimized away i guess
2010-11-15T01:08:07  <bhasker> but in python one pays the lookup overhead everytime
2010-11-15T01:08:24  <bhasker> so ... the object version turns out to be a lot more crappier than i expected
2010-11-15T01:08:37  <sigh> python you can't assume the lookups don't change
2010-11-15T01:08:43  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-15T01:08:49  <sigh> c++ most things are fixed at compile time
2010-11-15T01:08:56  <bhasker> i understand the reason now once i thought about it a bit more
2010-11-15T01:09:03  <antimatroid> and that's why i like c++
2010-11-15T01:09:08  <antimatroid> cause i have no idea about any of that stuff
2010-11-15T01:09:12  <antimatroid> c++ just works fast for me
2010-11-15T01:09:12  <sigh> haha
2010-11-15T01:09:23  <bhasker> antimatroid :) python gives the flexibility
2010-11-15T01:09:30  <bhasker> you just need to understand what is the cost you pay for it
2010-11-15T01:09:31  <antimatroid> c++ is very flexible i find
2010-11-15T01:09:36  <sigh> fast really depends on what you are measuring
2010-11-15T01:09:42  <antimatroid> there are very few things i can't do, and i expect python doesn
2010-11-15T01:09:44  <antimatroid> t do them either
2010-11-15T01:09:53  <bhasker> since my experience is limited with python i don't understand the cost for everything
2010-11-15T01:10:01  <antimatroid> sigh: any measurement is relative
2010-11-15T01:10:02  <bhasker> python == less development time
2010-11-15T01:10:07  <bhasker> so good for prototyping
2010-11-15T01:10:25  <bhasker> when you need raw compute speed c/c++ will always do better
2010-11-15T01:10:26  <antimatroid> i think i'm going to learn haskell after the contest
2010-11-15T01:10:38  <antimatroid> everyone seems to love higher level languages, and i think that'd be my one
2010-11-15T01:10:48  <bhasker> antimatroid c++ has its place
2010-11-15T01:10:50  <bhasker> and pythong its
2010-11-15T01:10:58  <bhasker> you just need to know what tool to use for what
2010-11-15T01:11:05  <bhasker> and have to do things a bit differently
2010-11-15T01:11:08  <bhasker> like i just learnt
2010-11-15T01:11:17  <antimatroid> bhasker: i'm not even really a programmer, i'm more a maths and economics student than anything
2010-11-15T01:11:19  <bhasker> a c++ programmer will just stick the variables in a class and be done with it
2010-11-15T01:11:40  <bhasker> a python programmer would probably have used a tuple
2010-11-15T01:11:42  <bhasker> like dmj did
2010-11-15T01:11:53  <bhasker> <-- being a c++ programmer i stuck stuff into an object
2010-11-15T01:11:55  <antimatroid> which makes these contests much more appealing than codejam etc. where it's more about my strategy than problem matching skills
2010-11-15T01:12:04  <bhasker> heh
2010-11-15T01:12:05  <sigh> bhasker: I would have stuck it into an object
2010-11-15T01:12:17  <sigh> only would have switched to tuple it if was too slow
2010-11-15T01:12:30  <bhasker> yea as i am realizing object is sloooooow
2010-11-15T01:12:32  <bhasker> like 10x slow
2010-11-15T01:12:35  <sigh> pretty much what you did, except I would have optimised other stuff first
2010-11-15T01:12:44  <bhasker> yea i did the same
2010-11-15T01:12:54  <sigh> like not calculating the state unless required
2010-11-15T01:12:55  <bhasker> except now that i got to this point where most of my time is in updateState
2010-11-15T01:13:15  <bhasker> well the reason i calculated them
2010-11-15T01:13:31  <bhasker> was it makes it easier to calculate stuff like new ships per turn per planet etc
2010-11-15T01:13:37  <bhasker> if i want to resolve for a lot of turns into future
2010-11-15T01:13:56  <bhasker> and another thing i am realizing is accessor functions are horrible in python
2010-11-15T01:14:09  <bhasker> the overhead of function calls for accessors is too high
2010-11-15T01:14:17  <antimatroid> yeah, i need future states to know what i can send at each time point
2010-11-15T01:14:29  <antimatroid> i couldn't do incremental calculation of that
2010-11-15T01:14:37  <bhasker> yea and its complicated to do it
2010-11-15T01:14:39  <bhasker> on the fly
2010-11-15T01:14:45  <bhasker> i would probably write a buggy version of it
2010-11-15T01:14:47  <bhasker> if i did it
2010-11-15T01:14:54  <antimatroid> not really, write an indexing function, and have the code in there
2010-11-15T01:14:59  <antimatroid> if not generated, generate, then index
2010-11-15T01:15:05  <amstan> these guys are killing me: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1094&start=20#p7295

2010-11-15T01:18:11  <bhasker> just shows that his bot isnt perfect?
2010-11-15T01:18:14  <sigh> meh, rather have people playing the game, rather than the map
2010-11-15T01:18:20  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=7356348
2010-11-15T01:18:22  <bhasker> i don't see how it reflects anything about the map itself
2010-11-15T01:18:53  <bhasker> he picked bad start planets
2010-11-15T01:18:58  <bhasker> not sure why you think he should have won that
2010-11-15T01:19:03  <antimatroid> sigh: i agree, although it probably could ahve been made more clear that the map generator was in no way official
2010-11-15T01:19:19  <antimatroid> i'm referring to the difference in ranking, not his choice of moves
2010-11-15T01:19:29  <sigh> yeah, I agree with that
2010-11-15T01:19:35  <bhasker> how does that matter he lost because he made a bad move
2010-11-15T01:19:39  <bhasker> the ranking is immaterial
2010-11-15T01:19:42  <sigh> difference in ranking is a result of choice of moves :P
2010-11-15T01:19:57  <bhasker> just one map on which he made a bad move
2010-11-15T01:20:09  <bhasker> probably something to fix in his bot's first turn logic
2010-11-15T01:20:17  <bhasker> to not ignore some good planets
2010-11-15T01:20:18  <bhasker> nearby
2010-11-15T01:20:29  <bhasker> i think he has some code to avoid any planet that can be contested
2010-11-15T01:20:36  <bhasker> and i see that his bot does that on most maps
2010-11-15T01:20:56  <bhasker> on turn 1 he always goes for safe planets only
2010-11-15T01:21:21  <burny> 'can be contested' means, is snipable?
2010-11-15T01:21:30  <bhasker> kind of
2010-11-15T01:21:39  <bhasker> mostly planets that can be reinforced by him
2010-11-15T01:21:44  <bhasker> faster than they can be attacked by enemy
2010-11-15T01:21:47  <bhasker> so planets close by to him
2010-11-15T01:21:50  <bhasker> or behind his primary planet
2010-11-15T01:22:04  <bhasker> he never goes for contestable planets on turn one on most maps
2010-11-15T01:22:17  <bhasker> anything in the middle/near middle is usually offlimits for his bots
2010-11-15T01:22:53  <antimatroid> as far as i can tell, there aren't any huge changes though, and crashes don't seem to be much of an issue near the top
2010-11-15T01:23:06  <antimatroid> so it went reasonbly smoothly so far
2010-11-15T01:23:40  <sigh> I'm glad there was a change, hopefully people will make more robust bots
2010-11-15T01:23:46  <antimatroid> there are two changes that need making to the map generator though
2010-11-15T01:24:00  <antimatroid> i've always been making mine robustly

2010-11-15T01:24:14  <sigh> heh
2010-11-15T01:25:23  <antimatroid> what would be interesting is if no planets were snipable on the first turn, and all middle neutrals started with ships <= its growth
2010-11-15T01:25:38  <antimatroid> that would make for really interesting maps actually, we should get some of those on mcleopolds server
2010-11-15T01:25:58  <sigh> that would be interesting

2010-11-15T01:28:41  <bhasker> bots that go for everything will probably win that map
2010-11-15T01:28:48  <bhasker> conservative bots will probably lose
2010-11-15T01:28:55  <antimatroid> nope, then you'd be snipable
2010-11-15T01:29:02  <bhasker> not really
2010-11-15T01:29:06  <antimatroid> yes really
2010-11-15T01:29:07  <bhasker> if planet cost is below growth
2010-11-15T01:29:14  <bhasker> then you always gain
2010-11-15T01:29:16  <antimatroid> non-spipable means you can defend it with all your might
2010-11-15T01:29:19  <bhasker> by taking it
2010-11-15T01:29:23  <bhasker> and holding for even one turn
2010-11-15T01:29:26  <bhasker> so enemy has to burn more ships
2010-11-15T01:29:29  <antimatroid> but if you take two, you don't have all your might
2010-11-15T01:29:31  <bhasker> than what you did to take it
2010-11-15T01:29:58  <bhasker> so conservative bots will be behind if they didnt take the planet on the first turn
2010-11-15T01:30:12  <antimatroid> yes, but if you took 4 planets
2010-11-15T01:30:17  <antimatroid> the other bot might then own you
2010-11-15T01:30:20  <bhasker> k let me think hold on
2010-11-15T01:30:32  <bhasker> if there were 20 planets of 5 growth each
2010-11-15T01:30:39  <bhasker> and costing 3
2010-11-15T01:30:45  <bhasker> i could take all of them with 4 ships
2010-11-15T01:30:47  <bhasker> each
2010-11-15T01:30:53  <bhasker> and have 20 in reserve
2010-11-15T01:30:56  <bhasker> now enemy counters
2010-11-15T01:31:07  <bhasker> he has to send at least 6 to each planet
2010-11-15T01:31:15  <bhasker> my growth will outpace him
2010-11-15T01:31:26  <bhasker> i will hold more planets than he does
2010-11-15T01:32:24  <bhasker> at least if i am not wrong conservative bots should lose in such situations
2010-11-15T01:33:28  <antimatroid> argh, there is a terrible error in the map generator
2010-11-15T01:33:37  <antimatroid> well, not breaking anything, but really stupid

2010-11-15T03:30:21  <medrimonia> In fact I've an ID for the central planet
2010-11-15T03:30:40  <antimatroid> there are possibly more than "one" central planets now

2010-11-15T03:31:21  <antimatroid> that's no longer required for line symmetric maps :)
2010-11-15T03:31:30  <medrimonia> And with the new map generator, my bot couldn't find it -> error
2010-11-15T03:31:52  <antimatroid> how do you like the new maps?
2010-11-15T03:32:05  <antimatroid> the gameplay is often a lot more interesting
2010-11-15T03:33:13  <medrimonia> I find it interesting and I think it will need a couple of modification to my bot
2010-11-15T03:34:14  <medrimonia> Because I was often making reference to the central planet

2010-11-15T03:37:11  <medrimonia> With the new generator, can we assume that the planet with the id of 0 will be one of the centrals planets antimatroid?
2010-11-15T03:40:23  <antimatroid> medrimonia: planet 0 is always at 14,14
2010-11-15T03:40:34  <antimatroid> actually, that will be 17,17 at some point
2010-11-15T03:40:39  <medrimonia> Thanks a lot
2010-11-15T03:40:44  <antimatroid> gah, don't listen to that
2010-11-15T03:41:11  <medrimonia> That's easier to make a quick patch to avoid the crashes on official server
2010-11-15T03:41:29  <antimatroid> it's currently at (14,14), that will change to (19,19), the maps are generated inside a circle centred around the origin then translated such that all coordinates are positive (for the visualiser)
2010-11-15T03:41:57  <antimatroid> the old max distance was 34, which got reduced to 24 by mistake, but that will change again
2010-11-15T03:42:55  <medrimonia> And now the minimal distance between the two homes planet is 4 right?
2010-11-15T03:43:12  <antimatroid> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/map_generator.py
2010-11-15T03:43:12  <antimatroid> that's the current map generator, 2 changes WILL be made, maxRadius will be 17 and a line needs to change when selecting ship counts for one lot of neutrals, but that's not really important
2010-11-15T03:43:19  <antimatroid> it always was :)
2010-11-15T03:43:42  <antimatroid> it was just possible for it to be less with line symmetric maps, but the maps get a lot more drawy as the players starting angles get closer
2010-11-15T03:44:08  <medrimonia> Really? I've played on maps were the distance was 1 or 2 on the TCP server
2010-11-15T03:45:43  <antimatroid> not possible
2010-11-15T03:45:52  <antimatroid> they had to start on opposite sides of the centre planet
2010-11-15T03:46:07  <antimatroid> it had to be at least 2 with min dist of 1, and min dist is officially set at 2
2010-11-15T03:46:15  <antimatroid> so it couldn't possibly be below 4 under those restrictions
2010-11-15T03:47:42  <medrimonia> I might be wrong.
2010-11-15T03:48:57  <antimatroid> there is a way actually
2010-11-15T03:49:28  <antimatroid> you could have (0,0) (0, 0.5) (0, 1.0) etc.
2010-11-15T03:49:31  <antimatroid> but that wont happen anymore
2010-11-15T03:50:39  <medrimonia>  I think that's really good, the games will be more differents and the bots have to be less specific
2010-11-15T03:52:03  <antimatroid> that's the idea
2010-11-15T03:52:09  <antimatroid> the map generator was always meant to change
2010-11-15T03:52:16  <antimatroid> possible earlier, but nothing had ever been set
2010-11-15T03:54:24  <medrimonia> But, nothing more will change between now and the deadline?
2010-11-15T03:54:31  <antimatroid> unlikely
2010-11-15T03:54:57  <antimatroid> if anything, only more restrictions on what the map must meet in order to be counted as "valid"
2010-11-15T03:55:00  <medrimonia> Cool because hotfixing during the last week would be hard

2010-11-15T11:58:32  <Migi32> I am now 99% certain that an algorithm that plays PlanetWars optimally is NP-hard.
2010-11-15T12:00:39  <Migi32> and interestingly enough, if you were allowed to send floating point ship numbers I'd not be so sure anymore
2010-11-15T12:02:29  <lavalamp_> how would floating point ship numbers make it easier?
2010-11-15T12:03:04  <lavalamp_> (and I would like to know your reasoning)
2010-11-15T12:04:58  <Migi32> the same way the 0-1 knapsack problem is harder than the fractional knapsack problem
2010-11-15T12:06:56  <Migi32> the same way "regular" linear programming problems are easier than integer linear programming problems

2010-11-15T12:13:17  <lavalamp_> yeah the space to search is N! where N is number of planets it's a good idea to attack
2010-11-15T12:16:14  <Migi32> well it's possible that you can eliminate some of those N! possibilities, maybe even enough to get polynomial time, but if this is my point: if you have an order in which you want to capture planets, from which planets will you take the ships to attack?

2010-11-15T12:17:23  <lavalamp_> ah in my view the idea order depends on which planets you have ships to draw from
2010-11-15T12:17:29  <lavalamp_> *ideal
2010-11-15T12:17:45  <Migi32> it most likely does
2010-11-15T12:18:39  <lavalamp_> So my bot applies one goal at a time, finding the ideal (in theory) places to get ships from to accomplish the goal.
2010-11-15T12:18:57  <lavalamp_> It builds a tree like this and sees which order allows the most goals to be accomplished.
2010-11-15T12:19:30  <lavalamp_> and it sucks atm because it's a little too good at accomplishing goals and overextends itself

2010-11-15T12:24:06  <lavalamp_> Migi32, I define a search order function; among other things, it tries to satisfy the goal with ships that are useful for the fewest number of other goals

2010-11-15T12:59:28  <antimatroid> we mustn't lose to these people :P
2010-11-15T12:59:46  <d0ugal> Looks like Turkey is ripe for the taking; http://ai-contest.com/country_profile.php?country_id=221
2010-11-15T13:00:12  <Error323> lol ye
2010-11-15T13:00:12  <JamesMG> have the maps on the TCP server been updated as well?
2010-11-15T13:00:18  <Error323> bhasker_: are you still working on it?
2010-11-15T13:00:22  <d0ugal> Or even. http://ai-contest.com/country_profile.php?country_id=222
2010-11-15T13:00:29  <antimatroid> i must say, i'm very surprised by the performance (or lack thereof) of asian nations in this, would that just be them not knowing of the existence of the contest? lack of interest? I can't imagine it's lack of ability
2010-11-15T13:00:54  <bhasker_> not really
2010-11-15T13:01:03  <antimatroid> JamesMG: nope, try here
2010-11-15T13:01:07  <antimatroid> http://zeroviz.us:8080/
2010-11-15T13:01:13  <antimatroid> keep using port 995 when running your bot
2010-11-15T13:01:37  <bhasker_> i was just tinkering with the code to see if i can write a fast max bot, in python, looks like after many tests, i need to rewrite my core state logic to use tuples instead of objects
2010-11-15T13:01:43  <bhasker_> python objects are insanely slow to copy
2010-11-15T13:01:56  <Error323> bhasker_: I found a very annoying fail in my 17.2 that would only become apparent when not running 17.0. So I switched back to 17.0 making everything i've done for the last week (alphabeta etc) obsolete :/
2010-11-15T13:02:02  <antimatroid> yea, that speed change before was crazy big
2010-11-15T13:02:13  <Error323> bhasker_: yep, that's true
2010-11-15T13:02:23  <antimatroid> c++ :)
2010-11-15T13:02:33  <bhasker_> i tried rewriting in c++

2010-11-15T13:02:37  <bhasker_> its too much work  :(
2010-11-15T13:02:42  <bhasker_> to rewrite all of my logic in c++
2010-11-15T13:02:46  <Error323> bhasker_: but take my advise, work out a good eval function first, because otherwise its freakin useless
2010-11-15T13:02:55  <antimatroid> hehe, i have found my rewrite painful
2010-11-15T13:02:57  <Error323> and a good eval function is very timeconsuming :/
2010-11-15T13:02:58  <bhasker_> i will jsut steal yours:p
2010-11-15T13:03:05  <Error323> mine really really sux

2010-11-15T13:03:20  <bhasker_> so i will tinker and see
2010-11-15T13:03:25  <antimatroid> you might as well submit at the end :P
2010-11-15T13:03:26  <bhasker_> once i rewrite the state handling code
2010-11-15T13:03:26  <JamesMG> thanks antimatroid
2010-11-15T13:03:40  <bhasker_> which requires substantial changes, since i index by name everything
2010-11-15T13:03:46  <bhasker_> i will have to change the code all over
2010-11-15T13:03:52  <antimatroid> i don't expect to win at this point, but top 10 would satisfy me
2010-11-15T13:03:53  <bhasker_> to index state by number

2010-11-15T13:04:18  <bhasker_> it will make the code rather unreadable but thats the price one pays
2010-11-15T13:04:20  <Error323> imo a gamestate is nothing more then all_planets, all_fleets right?
2010-11-15T13:04:42  <Error323> well for me it is anyway
2010-11-15T13:05:28  *** krokkrok <krokkrok!4c58a69c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.76.88.166.156> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2010-11-15T13:05:53  <antimatroid> my gamestate has turn, distances (pre calculated), bestPlanets, planets, futureStates, numeroud count vectors, a timer and an output file stream for debugging :)
2010-11-15T13:06:20  <bhasker_> my state is basically for each planet
2010-11-15T13:06:30  <antimatroid> the ofstream is just a pointer so I can have the same thing copied all over the place
2010-11-15T13:06:47  <Error323> mmm
2010-11-15T13:06:55  <bhasker_> an array of state objects containing ( 4-5 numbers, #ships,#owner,#myShips on that turn, #enemyShips,#origShips before battle resolution)
2010-11-15T13:06:58  <antimatroid> i did that orginally, but got sick of writing planets[source].futurestates[t] etc.
2010-11-15T13:07:05  <Error323> sounds like a lot of extra obsolete stuff
2010-11-15T13:07:14  <bhasker_> i basically calculate maxDistance*2+1 states for each planet
2010-11-15T13:07:23  <bhasker_> and use that to decide how many ships i need to send where etc
2010-11-15T13:07:26  <bhasker_> and how many are available
2010-11-15T13:07:29  <antimatroid> yeah, i do one more state than that
2010-11-15T13:07:44  <bhasker_> so for a typical map it can be
2010-11-15T13:07:53  <bhasker_> roughly 50*23 state objects
2010-11-15T13:07:55  <bhasker_> roughly
2010-11-15T13:07:58  <Error323> i have a very different approach lol xD
2010-11-15T13:08:04  <bhasker_> most maps have a turn distance of 23-24 max
2010-11-15T13:08:23  <antimatroid> yeah, the new generator has max dist of 24
2010-11-15T13:08:28  <antimatroid> but that will change to 34

2010-11-15T13:31:06  <medrimonia> Error323: Well until last Wednesday, this version of the bot wasn't even ranked in the top 100
2010-11-15T13:31:26  <medrimonia> I've just correct some (very bad) mistakes
2010-11-15T13:31:32  <Error323> medrimonia: well that just bad luck, it depends on your way up
2010-11-15T13:31:41  <medrimonia> And now it seems that it's a lot better
2010-11-15T13:32:10  <medrimonia> I don't think that I'll keep ranked like that
2010-11-15T13:32:28  <medrimonia> I will go down soon I think
2010-11-15T13:32:43  <Error323> ohh
2010-11-15T13:32:47  <Error323> you just submitted

2010-11-15T13:33:40  <medrimonia> It has played less than fifty games so I think that it's not stabilized yet
2010-11-15T13:33:48  <Error323> on tcp you need about 500 games for a stable rank faik
2010-11-15T13:33:50  <Error323> afaik*

2010-11-15T13:33:59  <Error323> i figure it won't be much different on official
2010-11-15T13:35:44  <medrimonia> Yes maybe a little bit less, but the thing that is really good now it's that you keep fighting against your levels bot when you submit a new bot
2010-11-15T13:36:07  <Error323> yup
2010-11-15T13:36:17  <d0ugal> Error323: I wouldn't be surprised if you need more on official, given the much higher number of people
2010-11-15T13:36:41  <medrimonia> And with the numbers of games per minute being rarely low, it's not as long as before to get a good rank
2010-11-15T13:36:45  <d0ugal> That and it'll only be stable if everybody stops changing and re-uploading
2010-11-15T13:37:16  <Error323> yes
2010-11-15T13:37:47  <medrimonia> I think that the ranking begin to "stabilize" a little bit after something like ten or fifteen games.
2010-11-15T13:37:59  <Error323> nah
2010-11-15T13:38:00  <medrimonia> but It won't be accurate
2010-11-15T13:38:04  <Error323> not necessarily
2010-11-15T13:38:20  <Error323> you need much more
2010-11-15T13:38:38  <medrimonia> If you're something like 300 after 10 games you will hardly be in top 10 after 300 games
2010-11-15T13:39:12  <Error323> well it can happen
2010-11-15T13:39:29  <Error323> and is also highly dependent on the enemies ur facing

2010-11-15T15:35:35  <Mistmanov> it's annoying that i'm the only serious contender from the VU
2010-11-15T15:35:51  <Error323> why?
2010-11-15T15:35:56  <Mistmanov> just.. eh
2010-11-15T15:36:07  <Mistmanov> would've been nice to have some adversaries that I actually knew

2010-11-15T15:37:36  <Error323> do you study AI at the VU?
2010-11-15T15:37:41  <Mistmanov> nope
2010-11-15T15:37:59  <Error323> I figured as much, heard its very non-technical there
2010-11-15T15:38:24  <Mistmanov> I've had like 1 programming course
2010-11-15T15:39:03  <Mistmanov> you?
2010-11-15T15:39:14  <Error323> mmm well you should take more :P
2010-11-15T15:39:23  <Error323> seem to bed oing well
2010-11-15T15:39:29  <Error323> I study AI at the UvA
2010-11-15T15:39:39  <Mistmanov> Ah cool =)
2010-11-15T15:39:43  <bhasker_> mistmanov your bot and mine seem to go up against each other quite often
2010-11-15T15:40:13  <Mistmanov> could be :p
2010-11-15T15:40:51  <Error323> so what do you study then?
2010-11-15T15:40:55  <Mistmanov> I don't often look at the official rankings.. outdated version of my bots, and people constantly being thrown to the bottom of the ranking
2010-11-15T15:41:00  <Mistmanov> (although they fixed that?)
2010-11-15T15:41:13  <bhasker_> yes they fixed it
2010-11-15T15:41:14  <Error323> thrown to the bottom?
2010-11-15T15:41:18  <bhasker_> beacuse of new uploads
2010-11-15T15:41:20  <Mistmanov> Last year in my master Molecular Biophysics
2010-11-15T15:41:22  <Error323> a with new submissions
2010-11-15T15:41:22  <bhasker_> earlier you lost your rank
2010-11-15T15:41:32  <bhasker_> now it matches you against similar ranked people even after an upload
2010-11-15T15:41:33  <Error323> wut, thats quite different
2010-11-15T15:41:36  <Error323> cool
2010-11-15T15:41:38  <Mistmanov> I should be writting a report on my internship right now..
2010-11-15T15:41:43  <Error323> hahahah
2010-11-15T15:41:47  <Error323> I'm in the exact same situation
2010-11-15T15:41:58  <Error323> but then... at my internship they introduced me to this
2010-11-15T15:42:06  <Error323> bastards
2010-11-15T15:42:12  <Mistmanov> ah, so that's at least kinda relevant
2010-11-15T15:42:26  <Error323> ye I guess
2010-11-15T15:42:40  <Error323> well some of them are participating
2010-11-15T15:42:45  <Error323> so had to beat them =)
2010-11-15T15:43:14  <Error323> or die trying or sth
2010-11-15T15:43:21  <Mistmanov> uhuh ;_
2010-11-15T15:43:44  <Mistmanov> yeah the UvA at least has some people uploading bots with some regularity..
2010-11-15T15:44:08  <Error323> true, but none in the top 100 -,-
2010-11-15T15:44:20  <Error323> and i know some study ai
2010-11-15T15:44:27  <Error323> so they should be :P
2010-11-15T15:44:34  <Mistmanov> true true =)
2010-11-15T15:44:52  <Mistmanov> the amount of non-affiliated people in the top rankings surprised me
2010-11-15T15:45:08  <Error323> well it only became changable after some time
2010-11-15T15:45:15  <Error323> and most prolly don't care what it says

2010-11-15T15:46:37  <Mistmanov> I'm not doing anything special at all
2010-11-15T15:46:47  <Mistmanov> (you could read my excellent threads in the strategy forum ;))
2010-11-15T15:47:06  <Error323> oh, haven't done that
2010-11-15T15:47:09  <Mistmanov> but primarily just calculating "how many ships do I have to send to be sure of victory"
2010-11-15T15:47:19  <Mistmanov> not a very good approach
2010-11-15T15:47:27  <Mistmanov> but surprisingly effective
2010-11-15T15:47:32  <Error323> yeah same here, all the fancy stuff I tried didn't work well or was too much work
2010-11-15T15:47:44  <Error323> to bring to perfection
2010-11-15T15:48:03  <Mistmanov> I really expected more bot's like bocksimacko's, that attack in patterns that a human just can't understand
2010-11-15T15:48:11  <Mistmanov> I honestly have no idea what his bot does
2010-11-15T15:48:34  <Error323> generates actions and evaluates the gamestate after applying them
2010-11-15T15:48:46  <Error323> the "max" part in the minimax algorithm
2010-11-15T15:49:02  <Mistmanov> yeah, so I had just the "programming for newbs" course right ;)
2010-11-15T15:49:14  <Error323> The problem is (in my experience) getting a proper evaluation functino
2010-11-15T15:49:21  <Error323> well you can look it up on the wiki
2010-11-15T15:49:24  <Error323> its not that difficult
2010-11-15T15:50:18  <Mistmanov> the intro on wikipedia makes it sound easy enough..
2010-11-15T15:50:21  <Error323> but ye he created a true monster
2010-11-15T15:50:46  <Error323> yep
2010-11-15T15:51:04  <Error323> its the basic AI stuff from year one in the bachelor

2010-11-15T15:51:47  <Mistmanov> =)
2010-11-15T15:51:56  <Mistmanov> effort that would be wasted when the map pool changes btw? ;)

2010-11-15T15:53:00  <lavalamp_> eval function
2010-11-15T15:53:34  <Error323> well it highly depends on your actionset I think
2010-11-15T15:53:56  <Error323> I can't imagine it working well without taking topological factors into account

2010-11-15T17:50:05  <davidjliu> how exciting
2010-11-15T17:50:15  <davidjliu> except apparently I like losing to people outside the top 100
2010-11-15T17:56:29  <medrimonia> Just to know, how much line is your bot around?
2010-11-15T17:56:55  <d0ugal> how much line?
2010-11-15T17:57:30  <medrimonia> yes, merging all the files, how much lines of code does that make
2010-11-15T17:57:38  <d0ugal> Oh I see
2010-11-15T17:57:56  <medrimonia> (my english is still bad, sorry)
2010-11-15T17:58:16  <d0ugal> Well, I guess it doesn't help you much unless you use the same language as me
2010-11-15T17:58:31  <burny> is there an assembly pack?   performance ftw!
2010-11-15T17:58:40  <Migi32> burny, you can make one :)
2010-11-15T17:58:59  <d0ugal> I'm using Python and I have about 800 lines of code
2010-11-15T17:59:04  <medrimonia> I'm using python too
2010-11-15T17:59:28  <d0ugal> Good man
2010-11-15T17:59:35  <d0ugal> But then, my bot isn't really all that good
2010-11-15T17:59:48  <Migi32> I use c++ and I have about 3 times that. Though only about 1000 lines actual bot code, the other are support classes
2010-11-15T17:59:53  <medrimonia> I have something about 1400 lines of code, but with a lot of comments and all
2010-11-15T18:00:14  <Migi32> by the way what does it matter?
2010-11-15T18:00:31  <d0ugal> It doesn't - I think medrimonia was just curious
2010-11-15T18:00:55  <medrimonia> Just curious
2010-11-15T18:01:14  <Migi32> k
2010-11-15T18:01:38  <medrimonia> And wanting to know if I'm not searching too much complicated
2010-11-15T18:01:59  <Migi32> actually I think I have more like 5000 lines of code, but I write { and } on their own lines
2010-11-15T18:02:04  <Migi32> (usually)
2010-11-15T18:02:12  <d0ugal> Yeah
2010-11-15T18:02:17  <davidjliu> mine's around 700 for what I've written, not including the unofficial starter pack, but that's including comments and stuff
2010-11-15T18:02:22  <burny> there's probably a top10 bot that can be done in around 100 lines
2010-11-15T18:02:42  <Migi32> well, I can make my bot 1 line.
2010-11-15T18:02:49  <d0ugal> It'll vary hugely depending on the language and  coding style anyway
2010-11-15T18:02:50  <burny> and get top 10?
2010-11-15T18:02:52  <d0ugal> Migi32: do it.
2010-11-15T18:02:59  <Migi32> nah, not get top 10 :P
2010-11-15T18:03:55  <d0ugal> Who wrote the starter packs?
2010-11-15T18:04:10  <d0ugal> The Python one is coded in a rather non-python fashion
2010-11-15T18:04:11  <Migi32> d0ugal, that would require removing all #include's and copy-pasting and all, I won't get into that.

2010-11-15T18:07:19  <Migi32> nice! :)
2010-11-15T18:09:25  <Migi32> McLeopold, about the maps with multiple starts, how about making it like this: port 8080 = "standard" maps, rated. port 8081 = special maps, unrated
2010-11-15T18:10:05  <McLeopold> I thought about that, but then I thought maybe enough people wouldn't connect
2010-11-15T18:10:48  <McLeopold> What I'd really like is for a bot to be able to request which map types they are willing to play
2010-11-15T18:11:20  <burny> make an optional #define
2010-11-15T18:12:28  <Migi32> McLeopold, well you could do that with comments, but there you will most likely not have enough people
2010-11-15T18:12:48  <McLeopold> yeah, I'll think about the multiple port idea
2010-11-15T18:13:12  <Migi32> would it be possible to have port 8081 play against both other people connected to 8081 *and* people connected to 8080 (on regular maps then)?
2010-11-15T18:13:23  <McLeopold> that would work
2010-11-15T18:13:51  <Migi32> ok, it was just an idea, do with it what you want :) but I have to go now
2010-11-15T18:13:52  <Migi32> bye :)

2010-11-15T21:34:21  <antimatroid> I think that's what janzert said
2010-11-15T21:34:40  <McLeopold> are you going to generate more?
2010-11-15T21:35:06  <antimatroid> i expect he will, i don't do any of that stuff
2010-11-15T21:35:09  <antimatroid> i'm still competing :)
2010-11-15T21:35:22  <antimatroid> i have 2 ideas for more maps on your server
2010-11-15T21:35:28  <McLeopold> what are they?
2010-11-15T21:36:04  <antimatroid> 1. start with no neutrals, but all symmetric
2010-11-15T21:36:04  <antimatroid> 2. all neutrals closest to you are non-snipable after the first move if take just the one, and centre planets start with ships <= their growth level
2010-11-15T21:36:58  <McLeopold> hmm
2010-11-15T21:36:58  <antimatroid> i'll knock generators up for those later if you'd be keen to add some?
2010-11-15T21:37:18  <McLeopold> That would be interesting.
2010-11-15T21:37:33  <McLeopold> But, I'm thinking of only using maps that would be used in the finals.
2010-11-15T21:37:38  <antimatroid> :(
2010-11-15T21:37:48  <McLeopold> That's why I'm wondering if there are more "official" maps.
2010-11-15T21:38:05  <McLeopold> I'd like to focus on tuning for the contest.
2010-11-15T21:38:08  <antimatroid> i wouldn't put up the same set the official server is using
2010-11-15T21:38:11  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: set up your own server if you want to continue experimenting with map generators
2010-11-15T21:38:12  <antimatroid> just use the generator
2010-11-15T21:38:32  <McLeopold> I've already put the official maps on.

2010-11-15T21:41:58  <antimatroid> yes, janzert made a couple of changes

2010-11-15T21:43:40  <rebelxt_> just noticed "Active bots" table - sweet!
2010-11-15T21:44:04  <McLeopold> k
2010-11-15T21:44:15  <McLeopold> does it randomly pick line or radial?
2010-11-15T21:44:22  <antimatroid> i wonder how bots will go with 30 planets and 34 max distance
2010-11-15T21:44:26  <antimatroid> i don't think that's been done yet
2010-11-15T21:44:32  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-11-15T21:44:38  <antimatroid> should be ~50% split
2010-11-15T21:45:15  <antimatroid> a set of 100 new ones would probably be nice to start with
2010-11-15T21:45:23  <antimatroid> then add more once people have sort of seen a lot of them
2010-11-15T21:46:00  <McLeopold> I may setup up a second port for fun maps, so go ahead and do that generator
2010-11-15T21:46:21  <antimatroid> i will do it later today, i want to play them anyway
2010-11-15T21:46:25  <antimatroid> even if others don't
2010-11-15T21:47:36  <McLeopold> what's the change to line 184 for?
2010-11-15T21:47:50  <antimatroid> so a neutral never starts with ships over 100
2010-11-15T21:47:58  <antimatroid> it's more for aesthetic purposes than anything
2010-11-15T21:48:28  <McLeopold> that's a complicated generator
2010-11-15T21:48:48  <McLeopold> I'll put mine on bitbucket later so you can see how easy it should be :P
2010-11-15T21:48:57  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: separate port for fun maps is a good idea. can you keep ratings pages separate as well then?
2010-11-15T21:49:03  <McLeopold> Yes
2010-11-15T21:49:40  <rebelxt_> awesome
2010-11-15T21:50:28  <antimatroid> yeah, I had never used python before and made if before i even knew wtf radial and line symmetry are called etc.

2010-11-15T22:14:55  <McLeopold> Is it a possibility for the dealine to be extended?
2010-11-15T22:15:16  <amstan> a lot more people would complain about that than the mapgen
2010-11-15T22:15:30  <McLeopold> So that's a no?
2010-11-15T22:16:01  <McLeopold> I think the new maps should only be used if there is an extension.
2010-11-15T22:16:13  <McLeopold> Otherwise, we should stick to the original generator.
2010-11-15T22:16:27  <amstan> why?
2010-11-15T22:16:31  <amstan> like
2010-11-15T22:16:33  <amstan> see that topic
2010-11-15T22:16:35  <amstan> see the poll
2010-11-15T22:16:53  <McLeopold> I like the new maps, but even I had unconsiously optimized for the older style.
2010-11-15T22:17:27  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3771), bix0r4ever(3633), dmj111(3576), protocolocon(3564), _iouri_(3559), davidjliu(3515), shangas(3505), george(3487), Xrillo(3477), jambachili(3458)
2010-11-15T22:17:32  <McLeopold> The game is now more different than it was.
2010-11-15T22:18:05  <antimatroid> you did that under assumptions
2010-11-15T22:18:10  <McLeopold> I would prefer and extension.
2010-11-15T22:18:19  <McLeopold> No, I didn't.
2010-11-15T22:18:30  <McLeopold> I made a lot of crazy test maps.
2010-11-15T22:19:05  <antimatroid> amstan: i think in future you should state that a bran new generator will be used in the final tournament, that only organisers will know the details of
2010-11-15T22:19:16  <McLeopold> Anyway, consider a second vote now that people have experienced the new maps.
2010-11-15T22:19:35  <amstan> so like.. bother jeff with this
2010-11-15T22:19:44  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I dissagree, openess is more fair.
2010-11-15T22:19:55  <antimatroid> open the generator at the end
2010-11-15T22:20:03  *** superflit <superflit!~superflit@c-24-9-162-197.hsd1.co.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-15T22:20:06  <antimatroid> or release a brand new one with a week left, so errors can be found
2010-11-15T22:20:21  <antimatroid> but i don't like having to gear my bot for a specific generator, that's boring
2010-11-15T22:20:59  <McLeopold> I'm just giving my opinion.
2010-11-15T22:21:07  <antimatroid> as am i :)
2010-11-15T22:21:09  <McLeopold> I thought you should know.
2010-11-15T22:22:31  <antimatroid> i haven't made a single choice off results of games, my bot is entirely written to implement a given strategy, everything is a matter of getting it to do what i intended
2010-11-15T22:22:42  <antimatroid> i would expect that's how such a contest should really be done
2010-11-15T22:22:50  <antimatroid> well, that's my idea of a perfect ai contest anyway :)
2010-11-15T22:23:12  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: you probably saw it on the forums that i had the same reaction but had no luck reversing the change. so i had to change my bot significantly since my eval function sucked for line symmetric maps
2010-11-15T22:23:47  <McLeopold> Yeah, I suspect a lot of people will have to rethink heuristics.
2010-11-15T22:24:00  <McLeopold> That's why I would prefer more time, or original maps.
2010-11-15T22:24:18  <antimatroid> my vote is with more time over original maps
2010-11-15T22:24:23  <McLeopold> me too!
2010-11-15T22:24:45  <antimatroid> but i really don't see why, people were never told to gear their heuristics towards point symmetric maps
2010-11-15T22:24:53  <antimatroid> maybe no example generator should be given in future?
2010-11-15T22:25:03  <antimatroid> tell contestants to come up with their own examples entirely
2010-11-15T22:25:11  <amstan> antimatroid: i think the issue was more of the maps already on the server
2010-11-15T22:25:25  <antimatroid> amstan: what do you mean?
2010-11-15T22:25:39  <amstan> antimatroid: we have to have maps on the servers already
2010-11-15T22:25:41  <amstan> for the visualizer
2010-11-15T22:26:02  <antimatroid> i'm confused
2010-11-15T22:26:11  <antimatroid> oh wait
2010-11-15T22:26:21  <antimatroid> yeah, but they can be stated as not representative of final maps either
2010-11-15T22:26:30  <antimatroid> it's just not said that they are now
2010-11-15T22:27:18  <McLeopold> at least there is a clear definition of the limits of the map now, but it was a little late
2010-11-15T22:27:30  <antimatroid> better late than never :P
2010-11-15T22:27:50  <McLeopold> horseshoes and handgrenades
2010-11-15T22:28:05  <antimatroid> i've seen that expression twice today now
2010-11-15T22:28:10  <antimatroid> first two times ever
2010-11-15T22:28:11  <antimatroid> why?
2010-11-15T22:28:23  <McLeopold> are you familiar with it?
2010-11-15T22:28:38  <antimatroid> the other one gave more details about it being the only approximaion method or something?
2010-11-15T22:28:40  <antimatroid> other than that, no
2010-11-15T22:28:58  <rebelxt_> McLeopold: i'm actually glad you came to this conclusion too even though it might be too late to reverse the map change decision
2010-11-15T22:29:10  <McLeopold> close only counts in horseshoes and handgrenades
2010-11-15T22:29:24  <McLeopold> meaning, you should be more exact
2010-11-15T22:29:43  <antimatroid> more exact about it being better late than never?
2010-11-15T22:29:46  <McLeopold> like, not waiting 80% into a contest to throw a curveball
2010-11-15T22:29:57  <antimatroid> it's not a curveball when the map generator was meant to change
2010-11-15T22:30:09  <antimatroid> my only issue is that it could have been clearer
2010-11-15T22:30:19  <antimatroid> and earlier
2010-11-15T22:30:33  <antimatroid> but people can't complain about the timing that much, they could have pushed like i did earlier
2010-11-15T22:30:35  <McLeopold> I agree that it is within the rules.  But there was no clear definition before.
2010-11-15T22:31:08  <McLeopold> Anyway, I know how to deal with the new maps, I just have to do it now.
2010-11-15T22:31:16  <McLeopold> I'm thinking of the others...
2010-11-15T22:31:29  <antimatroid> do you understand my argument though?
2010-11-15T22:31:46  <McLeopold> yeah, but I dissagree
2010-11-15T22:31:47  <antimatroid> that i haven't worked under those assumptions wheras some have, it's unfair to then just keep the old maps as well
2010-11-15T22:31:49  <antimatroid> why?
2010-11-15T22:32:00  <rebelxt_> time extension would be nice but i don't think this is very realistic. think of all the top people who want their life back ;-)
2010-11-15T22:32:01  <antimatroid> should i have made assumptions and got fucked over if most people didn't?
2010-11-15T22:32:20  <McLeopold> with a lack of clear guidelines, people had to make assumptions
2010-11-15T22:32:50  <antimatroid> my only implicit assumption is that i couldn't handle planet sizes over like 50 or 60
2010-11-15T22:32:59  <antimatroid> i don't tihnk assumptions past that needed to be made
2010-11-15T22:33:13  <antimatroid> should I have made more assumptions? I think that's a terrible thing to do
2010-11-15T22:33:21  <McLeopold> yeah, but you still made it, because it wasn't stated
2010-11-15T22:33:33  <antimatroid> yeah, but i could probably fix it to work on larger maps
2010-11-15T22:33:39  <antimatroid> it'd just be less smart
2010-11-15T22:33:50  <antimatroid> even that i'm not entirely bound to
2010-11-15T22:33:59  <antimatroid> strictly because of the specifications
2010-11-15T22:34:13  <antimatroid> i followed the rules, and you're saying i should be punished because a majority didn't
2010-11-15T22:34:22  <McLeopold> That's not what I'm saying
2010-11-15T22:34:27  <antimatroid> i think majority based decision rules are a crock of shit :P
2010-11-15T22:34:53  <antimatroid> what are you saying then?
2010-11-15T22:35:32  <McLeopold> Because there was not a clear definition of what a map would be, the organizers should stick to the original generator that people made their assumptions off of.
2010-11-15T22:35:49  <antimatroid> what about the people who worked off what the specification actually said?
2010-11-15T22:35:59  <antimatroid> or more importatly, didn't say?
2010-11-15T22:35:59  <McLeopold> what specification?
2010-11-15T22:36:08  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/specification.php
2010-11-15T22:36:24  <antimatroid> "Maps have no particular dimensions and are defined completely in terms of the planets and fleets in them."
2010-11-15T22:36:24  <antimatroid> "About the Current MapsMost maps on the server and in the starter packs were generated programmatically by a Python script. You may also create your own to use for testing."
2010-11-15T22:36:50  <antimatroid> people filled in the lines on the rest
2010-11-15T22:38:14  <antimatroid> it also doesn't say the turn limit will be specified, while I use that, i'm ready to throw that out in about 30 seconds if needed
2010-11-15T22:38:21  <antimatroid> it sounds like a lot of people DEPEND on it
2010-11-15T22:39:20  <McLeopold> I'm not sure if we have an official 200 yet, do we?
2010-11-15T22:39:34  <antimatroid> i highly doubt it will change, but it isn't official
2010-11-15T22:39:43  <antimatroid> amstan: can you just make that official and shut people up
2010-11-15T22:39:54  <McLeopold> :)
2010-11-15T22:40:02  <amstan> sure.. 200
2010-11-15T22:40:19  <antimatroid> while i have had games that I think would have changed results, they're very few and far between
2010-11-15T22:50:02  <antimatroid> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbxrvcK4pk1qbylvso1_400.png that's great
2010-11-15T22:50:22  *** pgpaskar1 is now known as pgpaskar
2010-11-15T22:51:33  <sigh> antimatroid: yeah, the canonical version of that is to say the diagonal of a square is of length 2
2010-11-15T22:52:15  <antimatroid> thing is it's not entirely wrong
2010-11-15T22:52:24  <antimatroid> it depends which norm you're using
2010-11-15T22:52:34  <sigh> yes it is, derivative does not converge
2010-11-15T22:52:48  <antimatroid> people assume you're using the euclidean norm
2010-11-15T22:52:56  <antimatroid> or metric or whatever
2010-11-15T22:53:02  <sigh> ok, run away into your fancy spaces then :P

2010-11-15T23:03:44  <McLeopold> I'm working on 100 new maps for my tcp server
2010-11-15T23:04:00  <lavalamp_> I'm working on a bot worth running on your server :/
2010-11-15T23:04:11  <mega1> I'm referring to the map area/widht issue
2010-11-15T23:04:23  <McLeopold> the radius 17
2010-11-15T23:04:42  <mega1> it would be really cool to have the generator finalized
2010-11-15T23:04:45  <antimatroid> mega1: Janzert is out of town, so after that i'd say
2010-11-15T23:05:08  <mega1> antimatroid: is the code updated?
2010-11-15T23:05:19  <mega1> if so I generate a few myself.
2010-11-15T23:05:27  <mega1> no point in testing on the old ones

2010-11-15T23:10:12  <antimatroid> mega1: if the official one works for you, mapRadius should really be 17 and line 184 should be
2010-11-15T23:10:12  <antimatroid> num_ships = max(maxShips, random.randint(minShips, 5*distance(p1, p2)-1))
2010-11-15T23:10:12  <antimatroid> to ensure the maxShips on a neutral condition is met
2010-11-15T23:10:56  <antimatroid> although some people seem to think there's a difference between having the map generated inside a square and circle with different areas, your thoughts? I thought just the maxDistance was important
2010-11-15T23:12:44  <mega1> I haven't thought about the details at all.
2010-11-15T23:12:57  <lavalamp_> I'll gen some maps

2010-11-15T23:19:21  <mega1> is it with the changes antimatroid outlined?
2010-11-15T23:19:27  <lavalamp_> Yeah, those two changes.
2010-11-15T23:19:28  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-15T23:20:12  <lavalamp_> here's the exact script I used: http://pastebin.com/zBafpvuM
2010-11-15T23:20:16  <antimatroid> i'd be curious of any others thoughts on whether it matters that the space in which planets can be placed is now larger but the max distance is preserved?
2010-11-15T23:20:31  <mega1> density matters
2010-11-15T23:20:38  <antimatroid> you basically having a circle encapsulating the old square
2010-11-15T23:20:43  <antimatroid> density should be near even
2010-11-15T23:20:57  <antimatroid> radius is calculated as r = sqrt(rand(0,1))*maxRadius
2010-11-15T23:21:08  <mega1> but not the same as in the old generator, right/
2010-11-15T23:21:08  <mega1> ?

2010-11-15T23:21:54  <antimatroid> if it is considered important, that could be fixed, my generator is pretty horrible :P
2010-11-15T23:21:58  <antimatroid> but it works
2010-11-15T23:23:15  <McLeopold> will the visualizer support the larger circle?
2010-11-15T23:23:34  <antimatroid> no idea how it works
2010-11-15T23:23:55  <antimatroid> if it's just giving a square of dimensions just above 17x17, then no
2010-11-15T23:24:33  <antimatroid> that wouldn't be hard to fix though, just scan the planets to generate max/min x/y values

2010-11-15T23:29:31  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: does it matter?
2010-11-15T23:29:38  <antimatroid> then you just have their one you can get
2010-11-15T23:29:45  <antimatroid> oh wait, yeah okay
2010-11-15T23:29:55  <lavalamp_> it means neither player can take it without getting sniped
2010-11-15T23:30:03  <McLeopold> it was in the new spec, but only specified against ragebot
2010-11-15T23:30:07  <antimatroid> nothing is said about not being sniped
2010-11-15T23:30:12  <lavalamp_> so that's a draw map
2010-11-15T23:30:16  <lavalamp_> lol, good point
2010-11-15T23:30:19  <antimatroid> although i think that could be added
2010-11-15T23:30:21  <McLeopold> there are a few that are drawish
2010-11-15T23:30:23  <lavalamp_> I don't care if there's draw maps
2010-11-15T23:30:39  <lavalamp_> they weed out the stupid
2010-11-15T23:30:48  <antimatroid> there's no really bad draw maps anymore at least
2010-11-15T23:30:59  <antimatroid> i don't think
2010-11-15T23:31:13  <mega1> I thought about the maps in the final tournament
2010-11-15T23:32:24  <mega1> my feeling is that how result of a bot on a particular map depend depends a lot more on the map than the map+opponent
2010-11-15T23:32:43  <McLeopold> yes, map type is a *big* factor
2010-11-15T23:32:44  <mega1> *how well a bot plays on a
2010-11-15T23:32:52  <antimatroid> hasn't that always been the case?
2010-11-15T23:32:56  <McLeopold> yes
2010-11-15T23:32:59  <mega1> yes
2010-11-15T23:33:36  <mega1> this makes me think that for a round robin of a hundred players we generate 200 maps and each player plays each map once
2010-11-15T23:33:51  <antimatroid> it's pretty much impossible to remove that element from a contest, I think that comes back to the tradeoff from having too few and too many maps
2010-11-15T23:34:04  <antimatroid> mega1: i would like something like that too, although the numbers might be a bit high to be feasible there
2010-11-15T23:34:11  <antimatroid> i wanted something like that for tron too
2010-11-15T23:35:02  <antimatroid> the biggest problem is your final top x are determined by games only with people inside that range, but i think it fixes more problems than that personally
2010-11-15T23:35:41  <lavalamp_> you can replace a huge round robin with a series of small ones
2010-11-15T23:35:56  <antimatroid> i started a discussion on this, did any of you see it?
2010-11-15T23:36:05  <McLeopold> the light are flickering...
2010-11-15T23:36:20  <antimatroid> how windy does it get tehre?
2010-11-15T23:36:25  <lavalamp_> i.e., 1-10 play a round robin, 11-20 play one, 21-30, etc. Then the table winners play a final round robin.
2010-11-15T23:36:51  <McLeopold> 13mph
2010-11-15T23:36:58  <lavalamp_> actually you should use slaughter parings
2010-11-15T23:36:59  <antimatroid> i think having the final tournament run in rounds incrementally chopping off bottom sections would work reasonably well too
2010-11-15T23:37:18  <lavalamp_> so 1, 11, 21 ... 91 play, and 2, 12, 22... play, etc
2010-11-15T23:37:19  <antimatroid> but the bottom bots don't get a very accurate ranking
2010-11-15T23:37:27  <antimatroid> other option is mergesort like tournaments
2010-11-15T23:37:48  <lavalamp_> that way the last round is more likely to have the strongest players
2010-11-15T23:37:49  <antimatroid> with the final round being a round robbin for each group

2010-11-15T23:39:01  <antimatroid> i think they need to get a copy of the top 1000 bots at the end of this, and test out a bunch of different ranking methods, and try to work out how each one does somehow
2010-11-15T23:39:30  <mega1> again, this should have specified at the beginning
2010-11-15T23:39:34  <mega1> +been
2010-11-15T23:39:53  <antimatroid> no arguments here on that :P
2010-11-15T23:40:18  <antimatroid> i think i'm in favour of more general rules than most, but everybody agrees that the rules should be clear at the start
2010-11-15T23:40:32  <mega1> for this reason I suggest sticking to how the tron tournament was done as much as possible
2010-11-15T23:40:43  <antimatroid> i don't like the way pairings was done for that
2010-11-15T23:40:45  <mega1> because that's the only thing contestants had to go by
2010-11-15T23:40:50  <mega1> how was it?
2010-11-15T23:40:50  <antimatroid> the top bots didn't play each other enough
2010-11-15T23:40:57  <antimatroid> completely random
2010-11-15T23:41:07  <antimatroid> go back and look how often you played the top 10
2010-11-15T23:41:11  <mega1> I thought it was a round-robin for the top 100
2010-11-15T23:41:16  <antimatroid> don't think so
2010-11-15T23:41:59  <antimatroid> well, there was no round robbin, not enough games

2010-11-15T23:44:33  <mega1> a1k0n played 2-5 exactly once
2010-11-15T23:44:53  <mega1> together with my vague recollection this is suggestive
2010-11-15T23:45:03  <antimatroid> hmm okay
2010-11-15T23:45:10  <antimatroid> i'd prefer to have the top bots playing each other quite a lot
2010-11-15T23:45:48  <antimatroid> otherwise 1 and 2 might be decided just off the luck of the map they were played on
2010-11-15T23:46:01  <antimatroid> that would be bad for someone like you who is obviously the best so far
2010-11-15T23:46:12  <antimatroid> and i think it's unideal in general
2010-11-15T23:46:55  <antimatroid> with a top x round robin, what if each player was assigned a map, and they played every other bot on that map?
2010-11-15T23:47:16  <antimatroid> nah that's terrible ignore that
2010-11-15T23:47:20  <mega1> that's about the worst possible solution
2010-11-15T23:47:29  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-15T23:47:59  <bhasker> gah finished rewriting the state code with tuples only to realize tuples are immutable
2010-11-15T23:48:00  <mega1> maybe if they also played only one opponent
2010-11-15T23:48:01  <bhasker> !@#!@#!@#
2010-11-15T23:48:10  <antimatroid> ehehe
2010-11-15T23:48:18  <bhasker> have to restructure code to not try and update tuples
2010-11-15T23:48:36  <mega1> I'm off to bed.
2010-11-15T23:48:45  <mega1> please beat up b0.64 on zeroviz
2010-11-15T23:48:48  <antimatroid> dream up a perfect ranking system :)

2010-11-15T23:49:07  <bhasker> looks like as-z03
2010-11-15T23:49:08  <bhasker> did it
2010-11-15T23:49:08  <mega1> it should be better at line symmetric maps
2010-11-15T23:49:09  <bhasker> already
2010-11-15T23:49:18  <bhasker> on tcp
2010-11-15T23:49:40  <antimatroid> that was a point symmetric map anyway
2010-11-15T23:49:40  <bhasker> no sleep for you mega1
2010-11-15T23:49:42  <mega1> bhasker: I'm more interested in zeroviz
