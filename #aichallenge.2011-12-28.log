2011-12-28T08:52:53  <Equinoxe> Hello all !
2011-12-28T08:53:07  <Anilm3> hi Equinoxe
2011-12-28T08:53:25  <Equinoxe> I am having fun trying to improved my ants bot, and discovered something that looks like a bug in the canvas
2011-12-28T08:53:32  <Equinoxe> improve*
2011-12-28T08:53:59  <Anilm3> oh
2011-12-28T08:54:10  <Equinoxe> When the bot has an error "move blocked" (a food spawned near it, and it tried to walk on it), the canvas remains blank
2011-12-28T08:54:27  <Equinoxe> When I manually erase the error in the replay, it all works fine
2011-12-28T08:54:57  <Equinoxe> Did you have this kind of bugs yet ?
2011-12-28T08:58:07  <Anilm3> Equinoxe: that would explain strange replays

2011-12-28T09:12:08  <UncleVasya> Equinoxe: hi. thank you for feedback. But I'm afraid your bugreport came too late :)  There is a very small chance that working ants vizualiser will ever be needed again for contest organisers. So the guy who made the visualizer will not bother to think about it anymore.

2011-12-28T09:26:02  <pairofdice> I'm hearing that the likeness of xpilot could be the next challenge. I like it.
2011-12-28T09:27:09  <pairofdice> It also sounds a fair bit more complicated than ants :)
2011-12-28T09:27:30  <Anilm3> pairofdice: seems cool

2011-12-28T09:30:54  <UncleVasya> I know some guys who don't like Ants because previous contests were 'nice in their simpliness' (how to right that word right?). Going for more complicated games can scare this kind of people.
2011-12-28T09:31:34  <pairofdice> Ants is simple imo
2011-12-28T09:31:46  <Anilm3> http://www.xpilot-ai.org/
2011-12-28T09:32:31  <pairofdice> Simple to get your toes wet anyway
2011-12-28T09:33:17  <pairofdice> But if these guys were the ones that only uploaded starter bots anyway...

2011-12-28T09:37:22  <UncleVasya> They like simple games not because they cannot do complicated ones but because for fun_project they do not want be bothered with reading too many rules (like battle resolution method or flow of gather-spawn-move-attack events).

2011-12-28T09:43:35  <pairofdice> It wasn't very much reading. You could skip the flow completely without much hindrance
2011-12-28T09:50:29  <UncleVasya> anyway, have they real point or not, I've heard such kind of thought about Ants (from my friends, on forum (not official one)). They did compete Ants (around 200nd place) but without so much attention as they gave for PW.
2011-12-28T09:51:49  <UncleVasya> I need to read about what x-pilot is for furthest discussion. :)
2011-12-28T09:54:21  <UncleVasya> But my point is that contests way for more complicated games can lead us to the situation when only few hundred of  'geeks' will compete.
2011-12-28T09:55:16  <antimatroid> planet wars required knowing the game mechanics too
2011-12-28T09:55:37  <antimatroid> for example there were three options for handling what happened when players simultaneously had fleets arriving at a planet

2011-12-28T09:55:56  <antimatroid> which didn't show up and need fixing until after the official launch because we didn't have a proper beta period
2011-12-28T09:56:11  <antimatroid> i think the real argument these people want to make is the difference from tron to say planet wars and ants
2011-12-28T09:56:36  <antimatroid> ie. something with a smaller state space that you could try out different ideas with more easily
2011-12-28T09:56:45  <antimatroid> and much simpler game mechanics

2011-12-28T09:57:13  <UncleVasya> sorry
2011-12-28T09:57:17  <UncleVasya> They did only PW and Ants
2011-12-28T09:58:44  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Congrats to you for beating Smiley
2011-12-28T09:58:53  <antimatroid> cheers :)
2011-12-28T09:59:15  <pairofdice> I agree that the game has to be simple
2011-12-28T09:59:21  <UncleVasya> I wanted him to beat you, but anyway....
2011-12-28T09:59:26  <antimatroid> i said something about placing first in aus being considerably easier than for the us and then an australian i'd never seen tlak on irc before was like "maybe for you" oops hehe
2011-12-28T09:59:34  <antimatroid> :(
2011-12-28T09:59:41  <ronchaine> I think ants had good amount of complexity.  It was simple enough to get started but required little more thinking to get into details.
2011-12-28T10:00:00  <antimatroid> i want to try something completely new
2011-12-28T10:00:06  <antimatroid> but i don't know how
2011-12-28T10:00:17  <antimatroid> everything is graph based and minimaxable
2011-12-28T10:00:27  <antimatroid> if you abuse it like I do with sample moves
2011-12-28T10:00:46  <Accoun> tcpants.com  dont make games for me
2011-12-28T10:00:50  <Accoun> {tcpants.com  dont make games for me}
2011-12-28T10:01:00  <antimatroid> i'm interested in the idea of biting the bullet and going for something more predictive with my next bot
2011-12-28T10:01:20  <antimatroid> i've always talked about modelling my enemy and predicting what they'll do off past moves, but have never actually tried it
2011-12-28T10:01:30  <pairofdice> Accoun: To be honest, we don't care :)
2011-12-28T10:01:35  <antimatroid> if done well that would have been really good for ants
2011-12-28T10:01:38  <Accoun> -{tcpants.com  dont make games for me}-
2011-12-28T10:02:08  <Accoun> saing it here sometimes help
2011-12-28T10:02:14  <antimatroid> Accoun: you should know from past contests that most people lose interest straight away, next time spend more time making sure your bot will run with the given resources
2011-12-28T10:02:15  <ronchaine> I treid to create 7x7 matrices around opponents ants in combat and use them to predict opponents moves, but I never got it finished.
2011-12-28T10:02:19  <pairofdice> But xpilot is dangerously close to 100% physics modeling
2011-12-28T10:02:21  <ronchaine> *tried
2011-12-28T10:02:33  <pairofdice> I love physics so no problem for me but...
2011-12-28T10:02:37  <antimatroid> I just used their locations for battle resolution
2011-12-28T10:02:59  <antimatroid> hehe, i've done no physics and i'm technically starting a phd in physics in the new year
2011-12-28T10:03:18  * Accoun added antimatroid to ignore list
2011-12-28T10:03:24  <UncleVasya> I was very surprised xathis does not differ opponents even in battle.
2011-12-28T10:03:39  <antimatroid> why?
2011-12-28T10:04:08  <UncleVasya> I do not differ too and consider them all as one enemy team but I thought it is okay only for semi-top bots.
2011-12-28T10:05:11  <antimatroid> i don't think there was anything amazing about the winning bots for pw or ants, just less bugs than other people and a superior combination of doing things in the right order
2011-12-28T10:05:29  <UncleVasya> Can I call my 42th place semi-top? :D
2011-12-28T10:05:39  <antimatroid> it would be cool if top solutions did start involving more complicated stuff
2011-12-28T10:05:42  <antimatroid> most certainly
2011-12-28T10:06:08  <antimatroid> we're the 1%
2011-12-28T10:06:10  <antimatroid> :P
2011-12-28T10:06:18  <pairofdice> I'm the 5%
2011-12-28T10:06:23  <antimatroid> peasant :)
2011-12-28T10:06:40  <UncleVasya> Did you saw 007 thread on PW forums?
2011-12-28T10:06:40  * antimatroid actually dislikes how much some people cared about others rankings during planet wars
2011-12-28T10:07:04  <antimatroid> often i'd be talking to people on irc about strategy and they'd actually ask for my ranking before having a conversation
2011-12-28T10:07:17  <antimatroid> it's basically saying "hey, i'll only talk to you if you're going to help me"
2011-12-28T10:07:31  <antimatroid> nope?
2011-12-28T10:07:56  <UncleVasya> When you care about ranking to much it always transforms from 'I want be better then my opponents' to 'I hope my opponents will be worse then me'
2011-12-28T10:08:21  * pairofdice hires some saboteurs
2011-12-28T10:08:22  <antimatroid> yeah, and you are never satisfied with the result
2011-12-28T10:08:32  <antimatroid> i'm very happy with my ants result from time spent on it

2011-12-28T14:44:06  <Migi32> I've had some fun with it, plotting the ranking curves of a few countries
2011-12-28T14:44:07  <Migi32> http://i.imgur.com/ZPqjE.png
2011-12-28T14:47:13  <Migi32> seems like native English-speaking countries didn't do too well, on average

2011-12-28T14:48:24  <Zannick> what is "Expected Rank"?
2011-12-28T14:49:00  <Migi32> expected rank = (rank in your country / number of contestants in your country) * total number of contestants
2011-12-28T14:49:18  <Zannick> oh, i see
2011-12-28T14:50:26  <Migi32> I cut it off at actual rank 2500, because above that it's only starter bots

2011-12-28T15:02:29  <Migi32> the graph doesn't really show very much actually, just that a larger % of American contestants submitted starter bots compared to Russia.

2011-12-28T15:42:35  <janzert> so US was most likely to upload a starter and then leave it while Russia least likely
2011-12-28T15:43:00  <janzert> the Ukraine line has some interesting jumps in it
