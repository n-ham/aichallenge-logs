2011-11-15T00:15:23  <a1k0n> geez.  found another major bug.
2011-11-15T00:16:31  <bmh> oh?
2011-11-15T00:17:01  <bmh> I found a hilarious bug with my gradient follower -- if it can't see food it will run into a corner
2011-11-15T00:17:53  <a1k0n> yeah, some of my ants in combat are doing random things, literally
2011-11-15T00:18:04  <a1k0n> heh, nice.  i notied that behavior
2011-11-15T00:18:08  <bmh> Why did you choose 3x7 for brute force?
2011-11-15T00:18:18  <a1k0n> because it was tractable
2011-11-15T00:18:24  <a1k0n> also solved 4x7
2011-11-15T00:18:37  <a1k0n> just as an experiment, mind.  water squares matter a lot.
2011-11-15T00:18:51  <a1k0n> must go read to my son
2011-11-15T00:18:54  <bmh> ah, you're using an empty 4x7!
2011-11-15T00:19:07  <bmh> a1k0n: Teach your son to read and he'll read to himself ;)
2011-11-15T00:19:54  <BenJackson> I realized last night just as I was falling asleep that an optimized distance calculation in my combat failed to take water into account
2011-11-15T00:20:02  <BenJackson> gotta fix that
2011-11-15T00:23:02  <bmh> is anyone actually using a genetic alg?

2011-11-15T00:27:25  <grom358> bmh: I asked about that and neural network and ppl replied that it wasn't a good solution for this challenge
2011-11-15T00:27:34  <bmh> grom358: it's a *terrible* idea
2011-11-15T00:28:05  <grom358> why though?
2011-11-15T00:28:11  <McLeopold> amstan: hello, you here?
2011-11-15T00:28:31  <bmh> grom358: Genetic algorithms tend to be the worst solution to any problem :)
2011-11-15T00:28:51  <bmh> They become easily stuck at local optima.
2011-11-15T00:31:51  <McLeopold> @later tell janzert We should fix the intentional suicide thing by deducting points for players that timeout or crash, any objections?
2011-11-15T00:31:51  <contestbot> McLeopold: Job's done.
2011-11-15T00:32:30  <grom358> how can u tell a plyer has timeout or crashed though?
2011-11-15T00:32:54  <grom358> by the fact none of their ants have moved for X turns?
2011-11-15T00:33:00  <McLeopold> grom358: we have timers checking for a timeout and a dead process to indicate crashes
2011-11-15T00:33:30  <bmh> McLeopold: have the worker woes passed?
2011-11-15T00:33:32  <McLeopold> it's all in the engine.py code
2011-11-15T00:33:43  <McLeopold> bmh: not sure, I've been out for a week
2011-11-15T00:35:05  <BenJackson> does that make you the mysterious Jeff?
2011-11-15T00:35:20  <McLeopold> Much less mysterious :)

2011-11-15T00:36:31  <BenJackson> that genetic algorithm thing reminded me of how I feel in the forums
2011-11-15T00:36:41  <bmh> BenJackson: stuck?
2011-11-15T00:36:44  <BenJackson> oh, you need help with X?  I'm torn between helping you with X and telling you X is a terrible idea
2011-11-15T00:36:55  <bmh> oh, just tell 'em.
2011-11-15T00:37:04  <BenJackson> hell no, they might make better bots ;-)
2011-11-15T00:37:10  <bmh> fair
2011-11-15T00:37:23  <BenJackson> but practically speaking everyone probably needs to work through a few ideas to really understand
2011-11-15T00:37:38  <BenJackson> heck, my first afternoon I implemented A* in python
2011-11-15T00:37:57  <bmh> I took two weeks to get diffusion working in Haskell.
2011-11-15T00:37:59  <BenJackson> there's probably more long-term benefit in learning how A* works than in winning the contest :)
2011-11-15T00:38:21  <bmh> Enlightenment occurs when you realize that Dijkstra's algorithm is a special case of A*.
2011-11-15T00:38:53  <BenJackson> heck, if all people did was implement pathfinding with BFS, A*, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, etc
2011-11-15T00:39:00  <BenJackson> they'd learn more than most people do in an intro ai class :)
2011-11-15T00:39:25  <analyst74> well

2011-11-15T00:40:42  <analyst74> it's the amount of imcompetent programmers that depress wages, I think

2011-11-15T00:42:57  <bmh> analyst74: terrible programmers give everyone else an endless supply of tasks.
2011-11-15T00:43:42  <bmh> I really do need to make my ants care about the hill
2011-11-15T00:43:54  <bmh> They forage like mad and then someone walks over and kills the hill.
2011-11-15T00:44:47  <BenJackson> in a recent game where I got squished there was a moment where I was defending against all 3 other players
2011-11-15T00:44:56  <bmh> wow
2011-11-15T00:44:59  <BenJackson> and some (maybe all) of them missed opportunities to take my hill

2011-11-15T00:59:54  <amstan> hmm, i should test this

2011-11-15T01:06:20  <amstan_> "longer
2011-11-15T01:06:30  <amstan> for some reason it only sends the first word
2011-11-15T01:06:38  <BenJackson> now do FTP!
2011-11-15T01:06:43  <amstan> BenJackson: did that
2011-11-15T01:07:06  <amstan> i also did pop and http
2011-11-15T01:07:17  <amstan> some pop servers are really scum, they kick you when you do typos
2011-11-15T01:07:20  <amstan> no way to backspace
2011-11-15T01:07:24  <BenJackson> if you want to up your game try IMAP
2011-11-15T01:07:25  <grom358> its nice to learn the nuts and bolts sometimes. I sometimes feel like putting together a basic OS that runs on virtualbox
2011-11-15T01:07:30  <amstan> sorry, not pop, SMTP
2011-11-15T01:08:12  <BenJackson> if you don't break out the IMAP docs there's one really confusing bit:
2011-11-15T01:08:26  <BenJackson> every command has to be preceded by a tag (arbitrary string) which the server will use with all replies to that command
2011-11-15T01:08:41  <amstan> irc is really easy on low level, you can even do help and the server will respond with a list of commands available
2011-11-15T01:08:44  <a1k0n> amstan: you need to do privmsg #aichallenge :hi there
2011-11-15T01:08:49  <a1k0n> with the colon
2011-11-15T01:08:51  <BenJackson> so unlike SMTP where "help" will get you going, IMAP will just bitch at you unti you figure out it's at least 'x help'
2011-11-15T01:09:31  <amstan_>  hi there, needs a space before the column as well
2011-11-15T01:09:46  <amstan_> no space after

2011-11-15T01:18:01  <BenJackson> we're all wondering
2011-11-15T01:18:06  <amstan> what i mean by that is that i have to wait for jeff to get the ball rolling
2011-11-15T01:18:27  <a1k0n> and jeff is omninonpresent
2011-11-15T01:18:51  <amstan> a1k0n: you mean the opposite?

2011-11-15T01:20:33  <BenJackson> no seriously, take my money
2011-11-15T01:20:49  <amstan> i should have a meeting with janzert first
2011-11-15T01:20:56  <amstan> also.. anybody know anything about mcleopold?
2011-11-15T01:21:03  <BenJackson> he was here earlier
2011-11-15T01:21:08  <BenJackson> I asked if he was the mysterious Jeff
2011-11-15T01:21:09  <amstan> contestbot: seen mcleopold
2011-11-15T01:21:09  <contestbot> amstan: mcleopold was last seen in #aichallenge 45 minutes and 49 seconds ago: <McLeopold> Much less mysterious :)
2011-11-15T01:21:16  <BenJackson> aaand that was his response
2011-11-15T01:21:26  <BenJackson> I think he told the bot to tell someone something

2011-11-15T01:21:52  <BenJackson> amstan: he said that, which is how I deduced he was Jeff

2011-11-15T01:22:29  <amstan> mcleopold's a cool guy that developed a bunch of the code from this contest
2011-11-15T01:22:48  <BenJackson> I remember seeing his name while cursing at the symmetry code
2011-11-15T01:22:57  <amstan> BenJackson: cursing? why?
2011-11-15T01:23:17  <BenJackson> I didn't correctly understand what it was trying to do
2011-11-15T01:23:30  <amstan> BenJackson: need some help with that? i'm working on a new mapgen, so i have a pretty good understanding of how it works
2011-11-15T01:23:32  <BenJackson> so trying to figure THAT out just based on what it DID was not easy
2011-11-15T01:23:44  <BenJackson> no, I get it now
2011-11-15T01:23:53  <BenJackson> map symmetry is not directly related to hill symmetry

2011-11-15T01:24:04  <amstan> it kinda is..
2011-11-15T01:24:13  <BenJackson> well, yes, and get_map_symmetry is how it kinda is
2011-11-15T01:24:15  <BenJackson> which took a while to figure out
2011-11-15T01:24:24  <amstan> look at this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/amstan_mapgen/ants/mapgen
2011-11-15T01:24:33  <amstan> it incorporated all different kinds of symmetries
2011-11-15T01:24:45  <BenJackson> btw I did figure out one bit of information the mapgen leaks
2011-11-15T01:25:04  <BenJackson> I hadn't figured out yet if it was possible to avoid so I wasn't sure I should rely on it :)
2011-11-15T01:25:07  <amstan> i have a function for each which a returns a list of points symmetric to an original point
2011-11-15T01:25:25  <amstan> what info?
2011-11-15T01:25:48  <BenJackson> rows and cols must be divisible by #hills
2011-11-15T01:25:56  <BenJackson> for some sizes that's useless
2011-11-15T01:25:56  <amstan> there's no other way
2011-11-15T01:26:03  <BenJackson> but the 3, 7 player maps are pretty obvious
2011-11-15T01:26:28  <BenJackson> the mapgen should probably work more factors into the size
2011-11-15T01:26:30  <amstan> don't you get the ammount of players you battle against anyway?
2011-11-15T01:26:35  <BenJackson> no
2011-11-15T01:26:46  <amstan> tricky
2011-11-15T01:26:47  <BenJackson> I asked that on the forum, even, because the C++ State gave me the idea it did
2011-11-15T01:27:06  <BenJackson> I realized it when I wanted to compute averge hill distance for some heuristic
2011-11-15T01:27:20  <amstan> yeah, the issue with the current mapgen is that it generates size based on num_players
2011-11-15T01:27:44  <BenJackson> I did look at the mapgen and I don't understand exactly how those symmetries work either
2011-11-15T01:27:59  <amstan> my new mapgen lets you use any sizes, but if you use translational_symmetry maps it'll check the divisibility thing
2011-11-15T01:28:06  <BenJackson> but I did figure out the "easiest" way that the game gives up information about symmetry
2011-11-15T01:28:45  <amstan> and also keep in mind that this is only useful for translational, you can have other symmetries which don't have that problem
2011-11-15T01:29:34  <amstan> but they could have other problems, like they must be square
2011-11-15T01:29:49  <amstan> see all the SymmetryExceptions in https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/amstan_mapgen/ants/mapgen/symmetricmap.py
2011-11-15T01:29:51  <BenJackson> yeah, I ended up sketching a bunch of tiny maps

2011-11-15T01:31:23  <BenJackson> the ants game is a good challenge
2011-11-15T01:31:29  <BenJackson> it's simple to describe but there are many subtleties

2011-11-15T01:32:11  <amstan> i like these kinds of things, where it was designed to be simple, but you end up with so many things that the designer didn't even think about
2011-11-15T01:32:26  <amstan> like minecraft's usage of booster cart glitch
2011-11-15T01:32:34  <BenJackson> fuckers broke my mine
2011-11-15T01:32:54  <amstan> when it was "fixed"? lol
2011-11-15T01:33:16  <amstan> Yeah, i had a good station with those, it's now all deserted
2011-11-15T01:33:25  <BenJackson> the main thing that made me abandon that map was the change in the terrain gen
2011-11-15T01:33:32  <amstan> yep, same
2011-11-15T01:33:37  <BenJackson> there was a nearby ungenerated square and when I generated it I got ugly "cliffs"
2011-11-15T01:33:51  <amstan> anyway, i should really go to bed, 1:30 am here
2011-11-15T01:33:56  <BenJackson> night

2011-11-15T05:46:52  <zaphus> Harakiri, I just grabbed it - I think it works... although my bot was acting weirdly so it's hard to say!
2011-11-15T05:47:52  <Anilm3> HaraKiri: zaphus: could you share a link?
2011-11-15T05:48:09  <HaraKiri> humm okay. how did you make it work? :D

2011-11-15T05:57:01  <zaphus> All I did was copy the files that you need - which is almost none of them...  (checking now)
2011-11-15T05:57:14  <zaphus> in visualiser/data/img  there's a new image
2011-11-15T05:57:21  <HaraKiri> and do your drawing commands actually appear on the visualizer?
2011-11-15T05:58:16  <HaraKiri> alot of the files in visualizer/js/ were changed
2011-11-15T05:58:16  <zaphus> in visualiser/js/  there are three changed files  application, canvaselement and const
2011-11-15T05:58:43  <zaphus> those are the ONLY files I took, replacing the starter tools files of the same names
2011-11-15T05:58:58  <zaphus> and yes, I get drawing (once I got the format correct)
2011-11-15T05:59:05  <HaraKiri> what language?
2011-11-15T05:59:38  <zaphus> C++, windows
2011-11-15T06:00:09  <zaphus> language shouldnt matter, but it's important to get the commands right!
2011-11-15T06:02:16  <HaraKiri> theyre not that hard :x
2011-11-15T06:02:19  <zaphus> Note: in the latest version it is off by default, you need to click the new icon
2011-11-15T06:02:44  <zaphus> Harikiri, no - not hard, except if you read the start of the forum rather than the later parts - the format changed
2011-11-15T06:03:35  <HaraKiri> omg, that was it
2011-11-15T06:03:39  <ikaros> =)
2011-11-15T06:03:47  <HaraKiri> why would you possible turn that thing off by default haha :D thanks alot
2011-11-15T06:04:35  <zaphus> yeah, off by default is odd - but I must admit after a while I dont want to see it until something odd happens
2011-11-15T06:05:13  <HaraKiri> yeah maybe

2011-11-15T07:22:33  <Anilm3> hahaha
2011-11-15T07:22:54  <Anilm3> and what are you doing?
2011-11-15T07:25:05  <digger3> Anilm3: I'm lazy, so it's simple. I combine different diffusion maps for enemy ants (negative), enemy hills (positive), enemy ants within range N of own hill (positive)  and food (positive) , with different decays and starting values. Individual ants maximize the value or, if all equal, move towards the least recently visited square
2011-11-15T07:25:11  <digger3> wow, it fits in 1 sentence :D
2011-11-15T07:26:57  <Anilm3> so that's why your ants always scape from enemy antes even in superiority
2011-11-15T07:27:10  <digger3> Anilm3: yes, good observation

2011-11-15T07:27:31  <Anilm3> your approach is similar to collaborative diffusion
2011-11-15T07:27:33  <digger3> Anilm3: the fix is to assign enemy_ants in the vicinity of a larger group of my own ants a positive value instead of a negative one
2011-11-15T07:28:07  <digger3> Anilm3: this would be very similar to my approach for defending my own hills (also a positive weight for closeby enemy ants)
2011-11-15T07:28:50  <Anilm3> or you can take into account your own ants in order counter the decay values
2011-11-15T07:28:55  <digger3> s/fix/hack/
2011-11-15T07:29:02  <Anilm3> in order to counter*
2011-11-15T07:29:41  <digger3> Anilm3: yes, that is also possible, but that will make them cluster together more and thus decrease the amount of exploration
2011-11-15T07:30:03  <digger3> not sure if I understood you correctly though...

2011-11-15T07:31:38  <grwip> does someone know what kind of approach is xathis using? I looked at some of his replay yesterday and it's really neat, his ants try to control the map, minimizing blind spots in the controlled area, I thought maybe he may be using collab diffusion
2011-11-15T07:32:55  <xathis> grwip: i've never looked into diffusion, just using a lot of bfs searches
2011-11-15T07:33:12  <grwip> xathis; hey hi, first time I see you here
2011-11-15T07:34:18  <digger3> Anilm3: I can't do heavy searching in state-spaces though as I'm using ruby and try to keep it below 100 lines or so :)
2011-11-15T07:34:36  <Anilm3> digger3: I see
2011-11-15T07:34:38  <grwip> xathis: congrats on your bot it's doing pretty well, so not even A* just plain bfs... I guess it doesn't always help to use complex stuff
2011-11-15T07:35:27  <xathis> grwip: oh i'm using A* as well, but for most of the things i do bfs is enough or even better
2011-11-15T07:35:35  <grwip> xathis: your idea is to control territory right? I see some of your ants staying around the same place, it looks like they are trying to maximize the visible area
2011-11-15T07:35:42  <grwip> xathis: oh ok
2011-11-15T07:37:19  <xathis> grip: in the araes that are safe, i try to have ants on positions so that i can see every tile, all the other ants are sent to explore/fight

2011-11-15T07:39:38  <xathis> bqf: i'm looking one turn ahead for a group of ants and look at all the possible move states
2011-11-15T07:40:13  <xathis> bqf: and with group i mean a group of both my ants and enemy ants

2011-11-15T09:23:33  <pairofdice> It's highly unlikely your computer should have the same turntime as the servers
2011-11-15T09:24:41  <twymer> just trying to figure out how to roughly reproduce it
2011-11-15T09:25:20  <twymer> waiting 5 hours between trials isn't really practical, and as far as i can tell from testing my code nothing is particularly slow..
2011-11-15T09:25:43  <pairofdice> Fortunately you can test it locally just fine
2011-11-15T09:26:05  <twymer> yeah but it's never timed out locally heh
2011-11-15T09:26:33  <pairofdice> Look at the exact moment of time-out and figure out what your code is doing
2011-11-15T09:27:10  <twymer> well my problem is the couple games where it timed out on opening turn or a few in

2011-11-15T10:17:03  <mcstar> i.e. to fill the entire space
2011-11-15T10:17:17  <mcstar> amstan: have you done any qt?
2011-11-15T10:17:27  <amstan> yeah, pyqt too
2011-11-15T10:17:31  <amstan> but not too much
2011-11-15T10:17:54  <mcstar> friend of mine asked me if its possible to make a tictactoe game in c++
2011-11-15T10:18:01  <mcstar> of course it is
2011-11-15T10:18:11  <mcstar> but it was more like: can you make a gui for it
2011-11-15T10:18:14  <pairofdice> Progresheh
2011-11-15T10:18:20  <mcstar> so i did the gui
2011-11-15T10:18:37  <mcstar> but now i realized im gonna write my battle code in it
2011-11-15T10:18:51  <mcstar> i make a nice gui for my tree-search
2011-11-15T10:19:07  <mcstar> and see what can i replace with heuristics
2011-11-15T10:20:08  <mcstar> amstan: basically, its gonna be a place the ants -> do the battle resolution
2011-11-15T10:20:13  <mcstar> this is the first stage
2011-11-15T10:20:34  <mcstar> do you think others might be interested in this?
2011-11-15T10:20:43  <mcstar> or should i share it at all?
2011-11-15T10:20:54  <amstan> what? a gui for testing battle code? probably
2011-11-15T10:20:58  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-15T10:20:59  <pairofdice> Well, this is a competition :)
2011-11-15T10:21:10  <mcstar> i dont want to share the "battle code" of course

2011-11-15T10:39:13  <mcstar> anyway, lets code
2011-11-15T10:39:31  <praveen> Yeah, start a discussion - exploration?
2011-11-15T10:40:05  <Conorach> just point every ant at the point furthest away from them? :p
2011-11-15T10:40:55  <praveen> every ant starts at the hill - now what is that point?
2011-11-15T10:41:16  <Conorach> well, first they will seek the closest food of course.
2011-11-15T10:41:19  <praveen> you have to spread the points in some manner, so they go in different directions
2011-11-15T10:41:25  <Conorach> ah true,
2011-11-15T10:41:42  <Conorach> random direction at start, and follow the wall whenever, unless (some chance) and they move orthagonal?
2011-11-15T10:41:43  <Conorach> :/
2011-11-15T10:41:49  <Conorach> My ants clearly suck at exploring.
2011-11-15T10:42:09  <praveen> am just starting to explore. I do gather food alone

2011-11-15T11:14:38  <janzert> each hill is 1 point for person controlling the hill at the end of the game, razing the hill transfers control

2011-11-15T11:16:01  <janzert> the big thing right now is the end bonus doesn't transfer the hill points from one player to another but just adds extra points for the hill
2011-11-15T11:16:42  <McLeopold> right, I'm thinking that the -1 should be applied even if the bonus isn't handed out
2011-11-15T11:18:07  <janzert> well someone should probably be getting points for each hill at the end of the game? Although disappearing points are certainly less likely to cause problems than extra
2011-11-15T11:19:34  <McLeopold> I like that a score goes down when losing hills, it give a sense of how a bot is doing
2011-11-15T11:19:36  <janzert> I suppose I could even see a rational to give timeouts and crashes a zero score though
2011-11-15T11:20:06  <McLeopold> The issue raised is that if you timeout, you can make sure you don't lose points
2011-11-15T11:20:14  <janzert> right
2011-11-15T11:20:20  <janzert> that's certainly bad
2011-11-15T11:21:07  <janzert> the end bonus shouldn't ever really be a bonus, but a final transfer of hill control
2011-11-15T11:21:09  <McLeopold> okay, I'll make the change so that timeout and crash lose all points for hills, the points for gaining control of those hills will be at a different time, either by razing or as an end bonus
2011-11-15T11:21:39  <McLeopold> janzert: agreed, but the visualizer shows how the points were transfered, which is nice
2011-11-15T11:21:40  <avdg> what I am asking, if a player gets eliminated, should that person earn less points than someone who gets timed out

2011-11-15T13:08:52  <avdg> so maybe that bot was trying to get closer
2011-11-15T13:09:00  <roflmao> ah so it attacked in process of moving towards
2011-11-15T13:09:12  <roflmao> the blue circle in front of it?
2011-11-15T13:09:39  <avdg> yeah, if that ant moved, it could be moving in that blue circle
2011-11-15T13:09:46  <roflmao> hm that's probably it
2011-11-15T13:09:52  <roflmao> although, in theory, both should move in at the same time
2011-11-15T13:09:56  <roflmao> but that's in theory :P
2011-11-15T13:10:13  <avdg> well, even a computer has to do things 1 at a time
2011-11-15T13:10:27  <pairofdice> Yes, but what if the blue moved to the right
2011-11-15T13:10:28  <treeform> i think it would have been more fun if they could move or shoot but not both
2011-11-15T13:10:29  <avdg> doing random things parallel is not the way to go
2011-11-15T13:10:40  <pairofdice> Then the top orange would be in range but left not

2011-11-15T13:13:42  <roflmao> yeah avdg that was it
2011-11-15T13:13:55  <roflmao> the bottom ant decided to take a path that didn't get it into combat range at the same time as the other one

2011-11-15T13:21:23  <Garf> improved protocol?

2011-11-15T13:22:09  <NightExcessive> Garf: Improved protocol by doing something like Kerberos for authentication, and using a worker/manager structure instead of having a single server do all of the work.

2011-11-15T13:25:04  <Garf> authentication -> vaguely useful if someones tries to attack you
2011-11-15T13:25:08  <NightExcessive> Garf: They're network limited, mostly. I have an already existing infrastructure to distribute workers in various location.

2011-11-15T13:25:26  <Garf> really? huh. I count a few kbs per client only
2011-11-15T13:25:40  <Garf> should handle 1000 clients easily. I dont see that much online anywhere
2011-11-15T13:25:57  <NightExcessive> Garf: Oh? There's also TCP connection limits (OS/router based) and latencies.

2011-11-15T13:30:25  <Garf> latencies? what do you mean by that?
2011-11-15T13:30:45  <Garf> I'm simply pointing out that IMHO you're solving a problem that doesn't exist.
2011-11-15T13:31:35  <a1k0n> hm, what happened to A on fluxid.pl
2011-11-15T13:31:43  <a1k0n> i want to fight heem
2011-11-15T13:31:44  <NightExcessive> Garf: By latencies I mean network latencies.
2011-11-15T13:32:27  <Garf> how will you solve that without partitioning the playerbase?
2011-11-15T13:33:38  <pairofdice> WOOO! Victory over a #94 rank bot
2011-11-15T13:33:55  <NightExcessive> Garf: I was thinking with a manager/worker scheme I could have clients connect to the manager, which redirects them to a worker nearest them... since latencies between my servers are quite low (and generally much better than the latency between a home connection and my server). And then, of course, the worker relays data back to the manager after a game.

2011-11-15T13:35:01  <Garf> NightExcessive: I don't see how this can reduce latency at all.
2011-11-15T13:35:06  <Fluxid> one moment
2011-11-15T13:35:14  <a1k0n> sure, thanks.
2011-11-15T13:35:40  <Garf> NightExcessive: unless your routing is so spectacularly better that your c->w->w->c time is better than the current c->s->c time
2011-11-15T13:35:42  <NightExcessive> Garf: Because network latency from, say, a home connection in Austria to a server in the United States is much higher than the latency from Austria to Germany.
2011-11-15T13:36:22  <Fluxid> a1k0n: connected
2011-11-15T13:36:30  <Garf> NightExcessive: that doesn't help you a thing, unless, as I already stated, you partition the playerbase and favor that the opponent in that game is *also* close to Germany
2011-11-15T13:36:39  <Garf> NightExcessive: if you don't do that, you'll increase your latency
2011-11-15T13:37:08  <a1k0n> or, unless he's trying to make it more fair, so that there are local workers that can enforce the turn limit times but have unlimited turn time between workers

2011-11-15T13:37:24  <NightExcessive> a1k0n: That's the idea.
2011-11-15T13:38:32  <NightExcessive> Garf: Essentially, people connect to the worker with the lowest latency to them and that worker managers the turns from that player. At the beginning of a game, a worker would be chosen as the manager of that game- and all other workers would relay data to that worker after their players' turns.
2011-11-15T13:38:49  <NightExcessive> Garf: It makes turn time limits practical and I think would make for more interesting games.
2011-11-15T13:39:06  <a1k0n> i doubt the games would be any more interesting.
2011-11-15T13:39:12  <Garf> This problem was solved in a far simpeler manner on the chess servers by time stamping the data.

2011-11-15T13:40:07  <Garf> besides, it solves a problem that isn't one: with TCP servers you already have hardware inequality, so making it more fair by enforcing time limits gets you nowhere

2011-11-15T13:44:12  <roflmao> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.36557 whyyyyyyyyy did you time out :(
2011-11-15T13:44:33  <Garf> Right now you can play a few games and see Sigma go from 3.0 -> 3.7
2011-11-15T13:44:48  <Garf> Even if the results were basically unsurprising.

2011-11-15T13:45:49  <g0llum> Garf, yeah let's think of a better idea for pairing there
2011-11-15T13:47:39  <g0llum> currently it seems to start a game and just does first comes, first served
2011-11-15T13:48:12  <NightExcessive> Yeah... Proper match making could get very computationally intensive, though.
2011-11-15T13:48:23  <Garf> I think you want working ratings first, before you can do matchmaking.
2011-11-15T13:48:34  <Garf> Without proper ratings, what are you going to base the matchmaking on? :P
2011-11-15T13:48:38  <NightExcessive> I agree. :P
2011-11-15T13:48:58  <g0llum> Garf, snake bites it's tail ?
2011-11-15T13:49:03  <pairofdice> A pair of dice
2011-11-15T13:49:40  <twymer> i like to blame python for my code being slow, usually it turns out to just be me writing bad code ;)
2011-11-15T13:50:03  <NightExcessive> twymer: Or Python's intricacies :P
2011-11-15T13:50:03  <pairofdice> Did you spot your problem?
2011-11-15T13:50:46  <twymer> pairofdice: yeah, it's how i handle unexplored territory. which is why if i time out, it's typically very early in the game (when that collection of goals is very large).
2011-11-15T13:51:07  <pairofdice> yup, happened to me too

2011-11-15T13:52:54  <Garf> Maybe this whole thing is a just a minus sign missing somewhere.

2011-11-15T14:50:44  <a1k0n> i think the "sigma issue" is mainly a result of there being an increasing number of bots on there, and the bots which are ranked highly haven't played in weeks and hence their sigma is small (cuz when they played there were fewer payers)

2011-11-15T16:55:29  <amstan> ok.. so what's the diff with the current setup?
2011-11-15T16:55:32  <amstan> all those new forums?
2011-11-15T16:55:45  <McLeopold> just the bottom 4
2011-11-15T16:55:54  <McLeopold> so, 3 new forums
2011-11-15T16:56:00  <amstan> 3?
2011-11-15T16:56:07  <McLeopold> 2
2011-11-15T16:56:22  <amstan> we have 2 spies, lol
2011-11-15T16:56:24  <McLeopold> Starter Packages and Tools -- and -- Rules Questions
2011-11-15T16:56:28  <amstan> had*
2011-11-15T16:57:09  <amstan> McLeopold: can we rename it to something else? rules will make a ton of people ask if they can write to files
2011-11-15T16:57:18  <a1k0n> Fluxid: did you change the maps/food spawn rate?
2011-11-15T16:57:20  <McLeopold> well, that is a rules question
2011-11-15T16:57:29  <amstan> yes, but that shouldn't be in ants then
2011-11-15T16:57:30  <a1k0n> more bots are timing out now, and there are a shitton of ants in play
2011-11-15T16:57:36  <McLeopold> amstan: we could make a sticky
2011-11-15T16:57:47  <McLeopold> Game Rules Questions?
2011-11-15T16:58:20  <McLeopold> but then where to general contest questions go?
2011-11-15T16:58:43  <amstan> like?
2011-11-15T16:58:50  <McLeopold> writing to files
2011-11-15T16:59:02  <McLeopold> right now I think they are in suggestions?
2011-11-15T16:59:21  <amstan> well.. they're pretty rare, and if they exist they're answered quickly
2011-11-15T16:59:27  <amstan> i don't think we need a forum for that
2011-11-15T16:59:39  <McLeopold> so, Suggestions (Contest Questions welcome here)?
2011-11-15T16:59:52  <a1k0n> retybok_: hah our last game was just insane
2011-11-15T17:00:06  <amstan> i would like to avoid debates on contest rules
2011-11-15T17:00:08  <a1k0n> 956 ants in the hive?

2011-11-15T17:02:34  <a1k0n> then who is smoke_carrot
2011-11-15T17:02:42  <amstan> McLeopold: what's the point of bot development then?
2011-11-15T17:03:07  <McLeopold> stuff I don't need to pay attention to as an admin
2011-11-15T17:03:14  <amstan> but who's going to post in there?
2011-11-15T17:03:30  <McLeopold> people who want to talk to each other via the forums
2011-11-15T17:03:37  <amstan> nobody's going to post some code they made and ask why it doesn't work
2011-11-15T17:04:12  <delt0r_> amstan: I think they will
2011-11-15T17:04:32  <McLeopold> I see your point, but it's a mess right now, so we need extra containers until it's cleaned up
2011-11-15T17:04:37  <amstan> delt0r_: well, it's just that nobody has posted such a thing yet that i distinctivelly remember
2011-11-15T17:04:40  <McLeopold> Maybe it can go away later
2011-11-15T17:05:08  <retybok_> a1k0n: smoke_carrot is me
2011-11-15T17:05:23  <a1k0n> retybok_: oh ok.  i suspected as much.  didn't you have a different name before?
2011-11-15T17:05:34  <McLeopold> Here's a non-admin dev post: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1663
2011-11-15T17:05:38  <retybok_> on the main site I'm "pierrejoel"
2011-11-15T17:06:00  <retybok_> anyways yeah that game was pretty insane
2011-11-15T17:06:15  <amstan> McLeopold: this would go to the starter packages forums if it was up to me, it's more relevant to the users in there
2011-11-15T17:06:18  <retybok_> I think my timeout was due to me trying to watch my bot output in screen
2011-11-15T17:06:20  <amstan> McLeopold: yet admins wouldn't care about it
2011-11-15T17:06:37  <delt0r_> Fluxid: What about more maps?
2011-11-15T17:07:26  <delt0r_> retybok_: that can be very expensive...
2011-11-15T17:07:56  <retybok_> delt0r_: especially when you have 200 ants and are logging like crazy :)
2011-11-15T17:09:09  <McLeopold> amstan: okay, maybe it goes away, but I at least need the other ones to get started on cleanup

2011-11-15T17:11:57  <amstan> McLeopold: i can't load the games off the main site anymore because of cross site scripting preventions
2011-11-15T17:11:58  <retybok_> delt0r_: at least I killed you :)
2011-11-15T17:11:58  <delt0r_> retybok_: I have a very simple bot

2011-11-15T17:12:20  <delt0r_> retybok_: java

2011-11-15T17:12:30  <a1k0n> no, it's fine
2011-11-15T17:12:44  <McLeopold> amstan: just copy the visualizer.js into the forums domain
2011-11-15T17:13:00  <amstan> McLeopold: visualizer code works, it just that it can't load the replay
2011-11-15T17:13:14  <McLeopold> oh
2011-11-15T17:13:35  <McLeopold> load the js from the main site?
2011-11-15T17:13:48  <McLeopold> I'm not up on my XSS rules
2011-11-15T17:14:26  <amstan> McLeopold: so, i'm loading both the .js and .replay from the main site
2011-11-15T17:14:32  <amstan> .js loads, .replay doesn't
2011-11-15T17:14:35  <delt0r_> retybok_: I am watching the games live ;)
2011-11-15T17:14:49  <delt0r_> just took out green --yea
2011-11-15T17:14:50  <a1k0n> it would be really awesome if the tcp server showed live games
2011-11-15T17:14:57  <delt0r_> think they where timed out
2011-11-15T17:15:13  <delt0r_> a1k0n: you can watch from your bots view with my visulaizer...
2011-11-15T17:15:18  <amstan> McLeopold: so what's going in the ant game rules forum?
2011-11-15T17:15:26  <a1k0n> oh really?
2011-11-15T17:15:37  <delt0r_> yea
2011-11-15T17:15:42  <a1k0n> you just wrap your bot with it?
2011-11-15T17:15:47  <delt0r_> its just a filter to your bot
2011-11-15T17:15:51  <a1k0n> awesome
2011-11-15T17:15:58  <delt0r_> so rather than "bot command
2011-11-15T17:16:03  <McLeopold> amstan: rules about the game, like scoring, movement and such
2011-11-15T17:16:22  <delt0r_> its now "java -jar AntWatcher2000.jar "bot command" "
2011-11-15T17:16:31  <delt0r_> post it on the forums
2011-11-15T17:16:32  <amstan> McLeopold: i can only find 2 topics already about that
2011-11-15T17:16:48  <amstan> so far*
2011-11-15T17:17:09  <McLeopold> I know I've seen more.  But even if it is a low volume, it is nice to have them in one place
2011-11-15T17:17:47  <amstan> k
2011-11-15T17:17:48  <amstan> it's up
2011-11-15T17:17:53  <delt0r_> post *is* on the forums
2011-11-15T17:17:59  <delt0r_> not it
2011-11-15T17:18:26  <McLeopold> amstan: so, you renamed Dev to Starter, so I can't separate out the stuff
2011-11-15T17:19:01  <a1k0n> thestinger: omg you bastard haha
2011-11-15T17:19:02  <amstan> McLeopold: originally i meant that to be a developer forums, but it seems like most of the action is on github
2011-11-15T17:19:30  <a1k0n> also what the fuck, i timed out?  no i didn't
2011-11-15T17:19:34  <a1k0n> arrrggghh
2011-11-15T17:19:51  <McLeopold> ok, but we need a way to separate admin questions from questions to and from contestants
2011-11-15T17:20:00  <thestinger> a1k0n: what did I do? :P
2011-11-15T17:20:04  <a1k0n> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.160
2011-11-15T17:20:10  <a1k0n> killed me with your last three ants or so
2011-11-15T17:20:54  <amstan> McLeopold: but i disagree, if admins are supposed to watch the starter pack forum, they can watch that
2011-11-15T17:21:15  <amstan> McLeopold: if someone posts a third party tool, there should be no reason not to put it in the same forums, from a users perspective
2011-11-15T17:21:52  <amstan> you want users to find information easily, it's not meant to be a ticketing system for us on user's issues
2011-11-15T17:22:05  <McLeopold> amstan: I'm concerned about missing a question asking for an official admin answer, because there is too much stuff to go through
2011-11-15T17:22:18  <amstan> also, a ton of the questions asked don't require admins to answer them, including stuff about starter packages

2011-11-15T17:44:12  <thestinger> and get rid of --scenario
2011-11-15T17:44:47  <thestinger> food rate will probably work too, but --scenario places stuff on the map at the start

2011-11-15T18:42:59  <Anilm3> In how it performs
2011-11-15T18:45:31  <mcstar> mine suck big time
2011-11-15T18:45:47  <mcstar> s
2011-11-15T18:46:42  <mcstar> they say qt is easy, but still, im a bit confused
2011-11-15T18:48:01  <amstan> mcstar: but it is
2011-11-15T18:48:06  <amstan> mcstar: what's the problem?
2011-11-15T18:48:31  <mcstar> nothing, just that ive never done this really before
2011-11-15T18:48:39  <mcstar> remember, im not a CS guy
2011-11-15T18:48:54  <amstan> mcstar: do you know python?
2011-11-15T18:49:19  <mcstar> my GUI experience is some windows guis, that i dont remember anymore, and an opengl madelbrot viewer
2011-11-15T18:49:30  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-15T18:49:39  <mcstar> not like a guru, but i know it to get along
2011-11-15T18:49:42  <amstan> you could try pyqt, it's much easier to test and stuff
2011-11-15T18:49:46  <mcstar> but thx, i dont want pyqt now
2011-11-15T18:50:02  <mcstar> yeah, im sure cause you can develop dynamically
2011-11-15T18:50:09  <mcstar> but im sticking to c++
2011-11-15T18:50:09  <amstan> also.. a lot of people seem to recomend qtcreator
2011-11-15T18:50:14  <mcstar> i need the experience
2011-11-15T18:50:20  <mcstar> i used that
2011-11-15T18:50:36  <mcstar> but it doesnt support full c++11 syntax
2011-11-15T18:50:46  <mcstar> so i switched to kdevelop,. which is even better
2011-11-15T18:50:52  <delt0r_> mcstar: you mean qt the widget tool kit?
2011-11-15T18:50:57  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-15T18:51:03  <thestinger> lol, clang_complete has been annoying me due to c++11 stuff
2011-11-15T18:51:08  <delt0r_> all gui toolkits sux
2011-11-15T18:51:09  <delt0r_> ALL
2011-11-15T18:51:11  <mcstar> amstan: btw i dont really need it, im not designing the gui, im programmin git
2011-11-15T18:51:31  <thestinger> it doesn't like the double right angle brackets for templates and makes vim underline them in red
2011-11-15T18:51:38  <amstan> mcstar: it could be useful for giving you ideas what on what kind of layout/widgets you want to have
2011-11-15T18:52:07  <mcstar> yep, right, but i find it more elegant to actually call functions than to rely on an xml
2011-11-15T18:52:11  <mcstar> but this is personal
2011-11-15T18:52:42  <mcstar> so my point is that qt is good(seems to be) but overwhelming at the same time
2011-11-15T18:52:51  <mcstar> ah, i did a bit of raw X too
2011-11-15T18:52:59  <mcstar> did a plotter for a project
2011-11-15T18:53:20  <amstan> i'm not saying to use the stuff generated by qtcreator, just use it as documentation and rapid sketching of what you want

2011-11-15T18:54:53  <thestinger> I really hate gtk/qt/tk/whatever
2011-11-15T18:54:59  <mcstar> haha
2011-11-15T18:55:03  <thestinger> when I do GUI crap I just hack it together in html/javascript
2011-11-15T18:55:06  <mcstar> i like opinionated people
2011-11-15T18:55:28  <mcstar> thestinger: so you prefer a browser interface?
2011-11-15T18:55:30  <thestinger> python/C++ just aren't good at dealing with asynchronous stuff like a GUI imo
2011-11-15T18:55:46  <amstan> thestinger: that probably gives you horrible usability
2011-11-15T18:56:03  <thestinger> amstan: well, I've only made GUI stuff for myself :P
2011-11-15T18:56:04  <amstan> what about tabs, tooltips, speed, memory usage?
2011-11-15T18:56:24  <thestinger> you can do tabs/tooltips with javascript
2011-11-15T18:56:41  <amstan> yeah, but you have to code a lot more to get to the same result
2011-11-15T18:56:58  <mcstar> theres some new java thing javafx, whats that?
2011-11-15T18:57:08  <delt0r_> mcstar: many over the years
2011-11-15T18:57:37  <mcstar> delt0r_: but now nowadays right? since you are into research again...
2011-11-15T18:57:39  <delt0r_> not matter what... its more or less hard work to anything rite.
2011-11-15T18:57:44  <mcstar> but not*
2011-11-15T18:57:54  <delt0r_> well now i stick with java...
2011-11-15T18:58:03  <delt0r_> no need to use n different gui toolkits
2011-11-15T18:58:17  <delt0r_> yes i still need to write them from time to time
2011-11-15T18:58:21  <mcstar> that program you showed me didnt even have a gui right?
2011-11-15T18:58:23  <mcstar> it was cli
2011-11-15T18:58:39  <delt0r_> yes... but there is a gui for teaching with it
2011-11-15T18:58:44  <mcstar> k
2011-11-15T18:58:50  <delt0r_> I will be adding more too
2011-11-15T18:59:13  <mcstar> i cant stand swing
2011-11-15T18:59:19  <thestinger> amstan: gnome 3 is basically just piles of css/javascript, so I guess you're right about the horrible usability thing
2011-11-15T18:59:20  <delt0r_> the problem is that a lot of users will not care that it deletes there HDD, but that the font is not the same as app X
2011-11-15T18:59:22  <mcstar> i opened netbeans, it was horrible
2011-11-15T19:00:17  <delt0r_> that kind of stuff is slow in all gui toolkits... every font every aa setting its a royal PITA
2011-11-15T19:00:24  <mcstar> i see many people write "there" while they mean "their" why is that:
2011-11-15T19:00:25  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-15T19:00:26  <delt0r_> mcstar: why --from the look?

2011-11-15T19:01:36  <delt0r_> the font setting are easily changed...
2011-11-15T19:01:50  <delt0r_> but yea eclipse starts with better defaults
2011-11-15T19:01:53  <mcstar> i have a tiling wm, awesome
2011-11-15T19:02:04  <mcstar> and it doesnt set a root wm something or other
2011-11-15T19:02:20  <mcstar> but the standard doesnt require it to, and java gui is not conformant

2011-11-15T19:07:18  <delt0r_> mcstar: my point is that NO gui is really conforming... to whatever standard... not really.. you the gui designer has to do it.
2011-11-15T19:07:21  <mcstar> maybe if i had a better vga....

2011-11-15T19:09:30  <thestinger> the widget only updates once a minute I think
2011-11-15T19:09:35  <mcstar> and theres a glitch with floating windows

2011-11-15T19:11:33  <thestinger> it's nice, but it takes some getting used to the paradigm it uses for windows (a tree with vertical/horizontal splits and containers, instead of layouts)

2011-11-15T20:14:14  <NightExcessive> Trying to figure out the Go libraries confuses me... why must making a sha256 hash be so complicated?

2011-11-15T20:15:33  <NightExcessive> thestinger: Oh?
2011-11-15T20:15:53  <NightExcessive> thestinger: I figured out sha256.New() and now I'm searching through the docs to find the Digest thing
2011-11-15T20:16:34  <thestinger> md5sum := md5.New(); md5sum.Write(bytes)
2011-11-15T20:16:54  <thestinger> md5sum.Sum() then gets you the hash
2011-11-15T20:17:15  <NightExcessive> thestinger: Ahhh. Thanks! :)
2011-11-15T20:17:18  <thestinger> if you want it in hex you have to use Sprintf or whatever
2011-11-15T20:18:09  <Rinum> combat w/ CD is really hard x.x whereas food gathering with CD is simple
2011-11-15T20:18:12  <thestinger> fmt.Sprintf("%x", md5sum.Sum()) would get you the e691414cadf3cc226ad078a43630e948 style string
2011-11-15T20:18:25  <NightExcessive> thestinger: Is that "PHP style?"

2011-11-15T20:18:41  <thestinger> dunno
2011-11-15T20:18:53  <thestinger> the libraries I've used call it the hex digest I think
2011-11-15T20:18:55  * avdg wonders where that line of php is written
2011-11-15T20:20:29  <NightExcessive> I probably shouldn't have done my TCP server in a language that I barely know :v

2011-11-15T21:08:25  <u_> is turntime measured from when the engine says "turn #" and starts giving you input or when it says "go" indicating it's finished?

2011-11-15T22:02:30  <amstan> yep, java's a bitch to support
2011-11-15T22:02:37  <NightExcessive> So I'll probably just port the Java library to Go.
2011-11-15T22:02:53  <amstan> isn't the library javascript or php or something?
2011-11-15T22:02:59  <amstan> php i think, the latest one we used
2011-11-15T22:04:29  <NightExcessive> I know one of them in the Git repo is PHP and the other is Java... and I can't remember what the third is. Python?
2011-11-15T22:04:34  <amstan> yes
2011-11-15T22:04:46  <NightExcessive> And I remember people in here were saying the PHP and Python ones didn't work properly.
2011-11-15T22:06:12  <NightExcessive> Plus I like the idea that my workers have absolutely no requirements for software- since Go is statically linked.
2011-11-15T22:06:26  <NightExcessive> I simply compiled it on one Debian 6 64-bit machine and then distribute it to the others.

2011-11-15T22:07:04  <amstan> what are you building anyway? workers? for what?
2011-11-15T22:07:08  <Nealefelaen> ... with the view range/radius (square root of 77, ~8.77), why can't the ants see 9 squares away?
2011-11-15T22:07:27  <amstan> because 9 squared is 81 which is more than 77
2011-11-15T22:07:42  <Nealefelaen> so you always round down?
2011-11-15T22:07:48  <amstan> there's no rounding
2011-11-15T22:07:52  <amstan> that's why it's squared
2011-11-15T22:08:11  <amstan> if you're square rooting, you're doing it wrong
2011-11-15T22:08:27  <amstan> compare everything while squared, so it's integers
2011-11-15T22:08:43  <Nealefelaen> mm, no, I have it as: if(x^2)+(y^2)>r^2
2011-11-15T22:08:47  <NightExcessive> amstan: I'm making a TCP server, but more distributed- partially for fun, partially because I don't want to run arbitrary servers on my web hosting server and partially because I think it might make interesting results.
2011-11-15T22:09:14  <amstan> but why do you need a distributed tcp server?
2011-11-15T22:09:31  <amstan> you can easily run a ton of users one one small server
2011-11-15T22:09:55  <NightExcessive> amstan: I don't *need* one :P
2011-11-15T22:10:00  <NightExcessive> amstan: But it's something to do.
2011-11-15T22:10:07  <amstan> make a bot?
2011-11-15T22:10:34  <NightExcessive> amstan: Already did- then got fed up because it wouldn't work.
2011-11-15T22:12:12  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mcleopold you have spam on paste.aichallenge.org, any ideas on a fix?
2011-11-15T22:12:12  <contestbot> amstan: Yep.
2011-11-15T22:12:51  <thestinger> amstan: add a question about the ants game :)
2011-11-15T22:13:08  <amstan> thestinger: hmm?
2011-11-15T22:13:09  <thestinger> amstan: cppreference has something where they ask a C++ question before you can edit, and the Arch Linux wiki does something similar
2011-11-15T22:13:11  <Nealefelaen> cheers amstan, not using the square root makes it make much more sense =)
2011-11-15T22:13:26  <thestinger> so you just need to ask something anyone doing this contest would know
2011-11-15T22:13:54  <thestinger> keeps out the persistent human spammers in addition to bots
2011-11-15T22:13:57  <amstan> thestinger: that could fix it i guess
2011-11-15T22:14:12  <amstan> temporarly, unless they're interested
2011-11-15T22:14:19  <amstan> persistent human spammers? how?
2011-11-15T22:15:18  <thestinger> well, I guess it depends on how persistent they are :P
2011-11-15T22:15:49  <thestinger> the Arch Wiki has a question that you basically answer by copypasting it into a *nix command line, and it got rid of all the human spammers
2011-11-15T22:16:29  <thestinger> not sure about what could be used for this
2011-11-15T22:17:26  <thestinger> I guess you could just require an account (maybe with an uploaded bot if they go the spammers just start registering, they'll only go so far)
2011-11-15T22:20:07  <thestinger> I managed to add 150 lines of code "refactoring"...
2011-11-15T22:23:21  <BenJackson> I seem to have written some new code with a bunch of obvious bugs that may still be better than the old version I happen to be testing against
2011-11-15T22:24:32  <thestinger> I think my new code fixed a bunch of bugs, but it appears to be inferior
2011-11-15T22:24:59  <thestinger> maybe the map I'm testing on is just rigged against the first player...

2011-11-15T22:39:29  <roflmao> I have no idea how he does it so he never loses an engagement
2011-11-15T22:39:33  <roflmao> in the sense that when his bots zap
2011-11-15T22:39:38  <roflmao> he always zaps more bot than the enemy
2011-11-15T22:39:40  <roflmao> so he keeps his!
2011-11-15T22:40:12  <roflmao> but thanks for the compliments all
2011-11-15T22:41:36  <NightExcessive> roflmao: He seems to be using some kind of flocking technique.
2011-11-15T22:42:04  <NightExcessive> And a really good one, at that.
2011-11-15T22:42:12  <roflmao> could be but I don't think that's what's making him the best player
2011-11-15T22:42:20  <roflmao> he simply has by far the best combat system developed
2011-11-15T22:42:26  <roflmao> look at the small individual engagements
2011-11-15T22:42:35  <roflmao> he always sets it up so he attacks with n+1 ants
2011-11-15T22:42:44  <Nealefelaen> only move to a square if any square that can attack that square is being attacked by at least two of your ants
2011-11-15T22:42:45  <NightExcessive> Mh. Good point.
2011-11-15T22:43:08  <Nealefelaen> any ant^ instead of any square^
2011-11-15T22:43:19  <Nealefelaen> enemy ant^ =P
2011-11-15T22:43:35  <NightExcessive> Sometimes the fact that Go errors if you don't use an import is *really* frustrating during debugging.

2011-11-15T22:46:31  <roflmao> only move to a square if any square that can attack the square you're moving to
2011-11-15T22:46:32  <NightExcessive> The only thing hard about that to implement is predicting the enemy- especially if it's RandomBot...
2011-11-15T22:46:39  <roflmao> is being attacked by MORE of your ants than your enemies ants?
2011-11-15T22:46:42  <thestinger> I edited all of my movement code, so all movement choices are now made at the end of the turn, and then combat stuff changes/gets rid of moves
2011-11-15T22:46:55  <roflmao> thestinger: does it work?

2011-11-15T22:51:50  <thestinger> well, at combat
2011-11-15T22:51:50  <Nealefelaen> does anyone have a replay of him against a crashed/timedout bot on a narrow map? =)
2011-11-15T22:52:18  <Nealefelaen> if he can't deal with static ants I might be able to beat him with my idea
2011-11-15T22:52:25  <thestinger> strcat_sane can actually handle static enemies with proper combat now
2011-11-15T22:52:35  <thestinger> but the code is almost useless against moving ants
2011-11-15T22:52:57  <Nealefelaen> I'm going to have different classes of ants, so both moving and static
2011-11-15T22:53:07  <NightExcessive> Is it bad that a Go program that prints "Hello world!\n" is 1.1MB? :v

2011-11-15T22:53:16  <roflmao> which just makes things very hard
2011-11-15T22:53:17  <Nealefelaen> NightExcessive: lol =D
2011-11-15T22:53:22  <thestinger> NightExcessive: run 'strip -s' on it

2011-11-15T22:53:44  <roflmao> hey, here's an idea!
2011-11-15T22:53:45  <NightExcessive> thestinger: Is that included in Go? (I'm running on a Windows laptop with the weeklies)
2011-11-15T22:53:59  <roflmao> treat combat radius as one square bigger than it is in reality
2011-11-15T22:54:07  <a1k0n> or two
2011-11-15T22:54:12  <roflmao> by increasing it by one you plan for any enemy moves

2011-11-15T23:37:10  <a1k0n> sssssssssssssshh!
2011-11-15T23:37:24  <bmh> I'm trying to persuade Eric to implement a sort-of-TSP solver for the early game.
2011-11-15T23:37:46  <bmh> a1k0n: your bot still does stupid things.
2011-11-15T23:37:54  <a1k0n> yes, it's completely broken right now
2011-11-15T23:38:03  <a1k0n> i just killed it to try to figure out wtf is going on
2011-11-15T23:38:25  <a1k0n> once i have enough ants (or something) it totally breaks down on collecting food
2011-11-15T23:38:55  <bmh> do you trade ants to stop people from seeing your hill?
2011-11-15T23:39:29  <a1k0n> i might.  i trade ants more and more urgently as enemies approach my hill
2011-11-15T23:40:25  <a1k0n> though it tends to just commit suicide a lot
2011-11-15T23:41:23  <bmh> once I can formulate the early game foraging problem I think I'll be able to solve it fairly close to optimally
2011-11-15T23:42:22  <a1k0n> wtf?  http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/sashaSochka
2011-11-15T23:42:34  <a1k0n> tcp rankings are definitely broken
2011-11-15T23:42:54  <bmh> hah, glory is fleeting
2011-11-15T23:45:40  <thestinger> yay. new bug
2011-11-15T23:46:22  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.616 sometimes my ants just decide to chill for a few turns...
2011-11-15T23:48:35  <a1k0n> at the opening?
2011-11-15T23:48:45  <thestinger> yeah, I think it's a bug in my foraging code
2011-11-15T23:48:57  <thestinger> that branch doesn't have defense or anything that would make them stay still
2011-11-15T23:49:14  <thestinger> ugh.. weird bug
2011-11-15T23:49:39  <thestinger> yay figured it out, foraging bug
2011-11-15T23:49:52  <thestinger> s/figured it out/figured out one of the causes/

2011-11-15T23:54:59  <bmh> a1k0n: have you implemented APSP?
2011-11-15T23:56:01  <bmh> (I should have payed closer attention when I was taking Planar Graph Optimization Algorithms)
2011-11-15T23:56:08  <bmh> payed paid
2011-11-15T23:56:54  <a1k0n> er.  not that i know of.  african people's socialist party?
2011-11-15T23:57:01  <bmh> all pairs shortest path
2011-11-15T23:57:14  <a1k0n> oh.  yes, i have implemented floyd-warshall in the past, on a much smaller graph
2011-11-15T23:57:57  <a1k0n> H^3 * W^3 seems like a lot of storage/time
2011-11-15T23:58:20  <bmh> the graph is planar, manhattan and the nodes are of degree 4 at the worst
2011-11-15T23:58:56  <a1k0n> yes... but there are still H*W graphs of size H*W to generate
2011-11-15T23:59:03  <a1k0n> so i guess that's ^2 space, ^3 time

2011-11-15T23:59:36  <bmh> you can be lazy and just solve for a subset of the points you're interested in
2011-11-15T23:59:49  <a1k0n> yes you could.  if you're doing that, then you should just use A*.
