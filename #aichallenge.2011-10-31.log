2011-10-31T00:00:59  <burny> I bet you I can get into top100 with zero path finding code
2011-10-31T00:01:12  <roflmao> I believe you
2011-10-31T00:01:20  <asdsfafas> burny: lol no way!
2011-10-31T00:01:37  * avdg believes as well, as long the bot is actually trying to pathfind in a certain way
2011-10-31T00:01:43  <burny> in planet wars, I got to top 100 with zero re-enforcement code
2011-10-31T00:01:55  <roflmao> (System.err.println didn't work :( )

2011-10-31T00:09:34  <avdg> read it ;-)
2011-10-31T00:09:39  <asdsfafas> roflmao: you could try writing w/e to a log file instead... that's what I did

2011-10-31T00:15:11  <roflmao> you know why I chose a*?
2011-10-31T00:15:21  <avdg> would be could if you don't know it and try to implement it
2011-10-31T00:15:25  <bmh> Imagine the map isn't 127^2 grid squares,  but instead a bunch of rooms
2011-10-31T00:15:28  <avdg> its actually the problem I have daily

2011-10-31T00:16:07  <roflmao> so you kind of pathfind based on rooms and stich them together or something
2011-10-31T00:16:19  <bmh> bingo
2011-10-31T00:16:19  <roflmao> that's pretty fkin awesome
2011-10-31T00:16:38  <yoden> heh, one of my friends is super stoked about hiearchical pathfinding
2011-10-31T00:16:43  <yoden> i still think it's not needed :>
2011-10-31T00:16:48  <bmh> hierarchical A*. figuring out an efficient hierarchy might be tricky
2011-10-31T00:16:50  <tmandry> lol, I was just thinking about that and feeling I was really crafty :p
2011-10-31T00:18:28  <bmh> this game will get really boring if a few people figure out how to make optimal bots.
2011-10-31T00:18:59  <avdg> meh, I need more math
2011-10-31T00:19:34  <roflmao> well bmh by the time people figure out the most optimal bots
2011-10-31T00:19:39  <roflmao> the challenge will be over
2011-10-31T00:19:56  <bmh> roflmao: December is a long way off.
2011-10-31T00:20:08  <yoden> do you really thing the problem is that simple?
2011-10-31T00:20:18  <bmh> no.
2011-10-31T00:20:22  <avdg> bmh: and I am already behind schedule ;-)
2011-10-31T00:20:34  <callahan> I think you need hierarchical room finding

2011-10-31T00:21:33  <bmh> yeah, well mine sits around and occasionally walks toward food
2011-10-31T00:21:43  <bmh> once it walked toward food, spawned another ant and then the ants ran into eachother.

2011-10-31T00:23:23  <roflmao> why does the bot complain about that lol
2011-10-31T00:23:26  <avdg> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=33780&row=10&col=13&turn=200
2011-10-31T00:23:44  <thestinger> they had to pick a symbol to use as a prefix to send a command to the bot (some use ! instead)
2011-10-31T00:23:46  <avdg> tip: think about the path one bot may have visited
2011-10-31T00:23:59  <avdg> and look at the other one
2011-10-31T00:24:20  <roflmao> avdg that boot is pretty pro

2011-10-31T00:35:44  <roflmao> ants**
2011-10-31T00:35:49  <avdg> the core is atm at 373 loc
2011-10-31T00:36:05  <roflmao> relatively small
2011-10-31T00:36:05  <avdg> and there are around 50 loc needed to get it working
2011-10-31T00:36:29  <avdg> actually, make it 100
2011-10-31T00:36:32  <callahan> What is xanthis doing?
2011-10-31T00:36:40  <avdg> because of some library functions
2011-10-31T00:36:48  <grom358> yah.. I have ant roles working
2011-10-31T00:36:49  <avdg> http://aichallenge.org/rankings.php
2011-10-31T00:37:00  <avdg> callahan: ^
2011-10-31T00:37:31  <callahan> I mean code wise
2011-10-31T00:37:45  <callahan> Looks like getting combat down makes a big difference
2011-10-31T00:38:01  <avdg> dunno, maybe doing something very stupid we don't actually know what it is doing?
2011-10-31T00:38:02  <grom358> yeah I still need combat
2011-10-31T00:38:26  <roflmao> hot damn that bot is good
2011-10-31T00:38:27  <grom358> omg.. some of these top ranking bots are version 1 bots :O
2011-10-31T00:38:29  <avdg> which explains why we are much more stupid than his ai and as consequence of that nobody will gain the lead
2011-10-31T00:38:40  <roflmao> xathis is a machine
2011-10-31T00:39:04  <thestinger> grom358: I started off uploading versions all the time, but I've given up on that and just use the tcp servers now - they were probably doing that from the start
2011-10-31T00:39:22  <thestinger> it takes my bot 3 days to climb back up to a stable rank due to how slow the games are played
2011-10-31T00:39:23  <asdsfafas> grom358: they made the bots before the contest started
2011-10-31T00:39:41  <avdg> I can actually already tell that xathis doesn't have the ultimate bot
2011-10-31T00:39:50  <avdg> it doesn't take the shortest route to the food
2011-10-31T00:40:06  <avdg> and he actually loses some games that way
2011-10-31T00:40:37  <roflmao> yes but his hunting is great
2011-10-31T00:41:10  <roflmao> fuynny how all these pro bots have a huge problem with clustering
2011-10-31T00:41:11  <asdsfafas> avdg: he's still #1 on fluxid (tcp) too
2011-10-31T00:41:37  <grom358> it sucks new version of bots have to climb all the way from the bottom
2011-10-31T00:41:52  <avdg> grom358: :-)
2011-10-31T00:41:56  <roflmao> what do you mean grom?
2011-10-31T00:42:08  <roflmao> oh
2011-10-31T00:42:08  <roflmao> duyh
2011-10-31T00:42:17  <grom358> well I was at rank 300 something.. and now I'm back down to 3885
2011-10-31T00:42:27  <callahan> I don't think aichallenge is as interesting as fluxid anyway.
2011-10-31T00:42:35  <callahan> The bots on fluxid are much tougher.
2011-10-31T00:42:37  <grom358> gonna take me ages to see if my changes improved it
2011-10-31T00:43:01  <thestinger> use the tcp servers for testing
2011-10-31T00:43:09  <thestinger> the official server doesn't play enough games to tell you anything
2011-10-31T00:43:23  <callahan> ^this
2011-10-31T00:43:32  <thestinger> I got to rank 45 with no code dealing with combat/enemy ants
2011-10-31T00:44:25  <thestinger> I uploaded a new improved version 2 days ago (still without combat) and it looks like it will climb up to the same place
2011-10-31T00:44:32  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255
2011-10-31T00:44:35  <callahan> I can't get very far on fluxid anymore.  combat clustering is getting more popular.
2011-10-31T00:44:37  <roflmao> so just curious, how long have yall been programmers?
2011-10-31T00:45:11  <avdg> 8 years sucking?
2011-10-31T00:45:17  <bmh> does the game runner devour stdout or stderr or both?
2011-10-31T00:45:24  <callahan> stdout
2011-10-31T00:45:28  <avdg> actually 5
2011-10-31T00:45:31  <avdg> or 6

2011-10-31T00:51:52  <roflmao> 108 is average man
2011-10-31T00:51:55  <avdg> just lack of education
2011-10-31T00:51:58  <roflmao> what's the diff between fluxid and current
2011-10-31T00:52:26  <avdg> I think my iq can be quite higher without the situation
2011-10-31T00:52:30  <avdg> but whatever
2011-10-31T00:52:32  <roflmao> ah I see
2011-10-31T00:52:36  <avdg> iq doesn't tell everything
2011-10-31T00:52:40  <roflmao> well I'm broke and can't go to college cause of money
2011-10-31T00:52:55  <roflmao> so high five
2011-10-31T00:52:57  <thestinger> roflmao: it uses a tcp server/client wrapper around the game engine so it runs games very fast
2011-10-31T00:53:01  *** ccc <ccc!18057e2a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.24.5.126.42> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-31T00:53:09  <thestinger> you can play hundreds of games a day
2011-10-31T00:53:22  <roflmao> ah nice
2011-10-31T00:53:33  <avdg> I can't develop that fast atm ;-)
2011-10-31T00:53:37  <thestinger> if you run more than one bot concurrently I guess you could play over a thousand - that would be good for testing two or more strategies
2011-10-31T00:54:11  <ccc> hello, my bot crashes when i use -O3 -funroll-loops option in gcc, but otherwise it works. I remember someone here saying the tournament admins use -O3 too. How to find my error?
2011-10-31T00:54:18  <avdg> roflmao: 108 is still above, if you add the fact that 100 is a calibrated number by each iq test release
2011-10-31T00:54:27  <avdg> but thats only part of the story
2011-10-31T00:54:27  <roflmao> well there you have it
2011-10-31T00:54:31  <avdg> its way more complex
2011-10-31T00:54:39  <thestinger> ccc: turn on all the gcc warnings and then turn off the ones that annoy you too much
2011-10-31T00:54:48  <roflmao> yeh, well, just sayin, if you can't go to college for whatever reasons
2011-10-31T00:54:53  <roflmao> programming is a great career to go into
2011-10-31T00:55:08  <roflmao> get a OCJP or something, employers really like em.
2011-10-31T00:55:09  <thestinger> ccc: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/Warning-Options.html
2011-10-31T00:55:13  <avdg> yeah, but the people here are only interested in educated people
2011-10-31T00:55:38  <roflmao> yeh the system fucking sucks
2011-10-31T00:55:55  <roflmao> there should be standardized tests
2011-10-31T00:55:57  <avdg> oh well, I actually ignore these things
2011-10-31T00:55:58  <roflmao> pay 100 bucks or so
2011-10-31T00:56:03  <roflmao> prepare however you want to
2011-10-31T00:56:07  <callahan> ccc: compile with -Wall, fix all warnings.  If it still crashes run it with valgrind
2011-10-31T00:56:30  <avdg> roflmao: that doesn't balance the fact that people from school are more uniformed and by this more easily to fit in the industry
2011-10-31T00:57:05  <roflmao> true
2011-10-31T00:57:11  <ccc> I compiled with -Wall -O3 -funroll-loops and there are absolutely no warnings, the bot crashes at turn 1, without anyoptions my bot plays well
2011-10-31T00:57:16  <roflmao> but they way people are pidgeonholed into student loans is just pure evil
2011-10-31T00:57:22  <roflmao> the*
2011-10-31T00:57:29  <thestinger> ccc: -Wextra, -Wstrict-overflow=5, etc.
2011-10-31T00:57:34  <roflmao> considering how in today's day and age of information education could and should be vastly cheaper
2011-10-31T00:57:38  <callahan> ccc: Most likely uninitialized variables that gcc allocates more agressively with optimizations on.
2011-10-31T00:57:41  <thestinger> -Wall just turns on warnings that most people don't ever get annoyed by
2011-10-31T00:57:43  <roflmao> everything you learn in college you can learn with textbooks and the internet
2011-10-31T00:57:53  <roflmao> but you don't get the degree
2011-10-31T00:57:53  <avdg> well, it still takes efforts to do it
2011-10-31T00:57:56  <avdg> and interest
2011-10-31T00:58:03  <roflmao> oh yeah, definitely
2011-10-31T00:58:06  <callahan> ccc: run it with valgrind
2011-10-31T00:58:07  <avdg> since many people are only interested in the money
2011-10-31T00:58:09  <grom358> mmm.. what the.. it keeps saying my bot failed to start when using tcpclient
2011-10-31T00:58:24  <grom358> python tcpclient.py ants.fluxid.pl 2081 "java -jar MyBot.jar" grom358 passwd 3
2011-10-31T00:58:57  <ccc> yep, i see warnings now - "warning: assuming signed overflow does not occur when changing X +- C1 cmp C2 to X cmp C1 +- C2"
2011-10-31T00:59:07  <ccc> thanks guys, i'll try to figure it out now
2011-10-31T01:00:26  <thestinger> ccc: I start with something like this http://pastie.org/2786200 and turn off -Weffc++, -Wconversion, etc. when they start being annoying
2011-10-31T01:00:32  <grom358> anyone?
2011-10-31T01:01:06  <thestinger> -Wconversion isn't actually that bad in C++, but it is annoying as hell in C
2011-10-31T01:01:09  <callahan> grom358 Try an absolute path
2011-10-31T01:01:15  <callahan> for MyBot.jar

2011-10-31T01:02:33  <thestinger> what happens if you just do 'java -jar MyBot.jar'
2011-10-31T01:02:49  <grom358> thestinger: sits there waiting for input
2011-10-31T01:02:59  <callahan> What's the 3 for at the end?
2011-10-31T01:03:05  <grom358> FYI the bot runs locally
2011-10-31T01:03:07  <thestinger> 3 games
2011-10-31T01:03:12  <thestinger> -1 plays unlimited games
2011-10-31T01:03:15  <callahan> Ahh
2011-10-31T01:04:10  <thestinger> grom358: try giving an absolute path to the .jar file
2011-10-31T01:04:20  <grom358> thestinger: I did.. same result
2011-10-31T01:04:33  <grom358> sudo python tcpclient.py ants.fluxid.pl 2081 "java -jar /home/grom/tmp/ants/MyBot.jar" grom358 pass 3
2011-10-31T01:04:40  <grom358> even tried to sudo it
2011-10-31T01:04:49  <callahan> Don't need sudo
2011-10-31T01:05:11  <grom358> yeah.. well it don't work without it either
2011-10-31T01:05:46  <thestinger> I'm guessing that the tcpclient is somehow losing env variables that java needs

2011-10-31T01:07:14  <grom358> yeah env | grep -i java returns nothing
2011-10-31T01:08:19  <thestinger> does your bot work with the playgame.py script?
2011-10-31T01:08:28  <grom358> thestinger: yeap
2011-10-31T01:08:48  <thestinger> maybe try 'echo $PATH' and pass it manually to java
2011-10-31T01:08:50  <grom358> and it works when I upload too
2011-10-31T01:09:20  <thestinger> well, "PATH=$PATH java" or w/e in the command

2011-10-31T01:12:45  <grom358> nope
2011-10-31T01:14:41  <thestinger> what version of python is 'python' on your distro?

2011-10-31T01:23:21  <v_paul_v> how use logutils?
2011-10-31T01:23:32  <v_paul_v> where is logs?
2011-10-31T01:23:39  <thestinger> I think you just pasted part of the call (I see subprocess.PIPE in the file)
2011-10-31T01:23:56  <grom358> thestinger: I just make a 2 line script

2011-10-31T01:27:14  <thestinger> grom358: ah, you actually need to pass a list to Popen
2011-10-31T01:27:31  <v_paul_v> i use logutils as in examle, but i don't khow where is file with logs
2011-10-31T01:27:42  <v_paul_v> *know
2011-10-31T01:27:48  <thestinger> ['/path/to/java', '-jar', '/path/to/jar/jar.jar']
2011-10-31T01:27:58  <thestinger> as the first argument instead of a string
2011-10-31T01:29:30  <grom358> thestinger: mm that works.. but when I look at the tcpclient it not passsing it as list like that
2011-10-31T01:29:35  <thestinger> it looks like the tcpclient script is meant to work with files that can just be executed (binaries or scripts with a shebang)
2011-10-31T01:29:44  <thestinger> you could make a little #!/bin/sh script to run your bot
2011-10-31T01:30:16  <thestinger> exec java -jar jarfile
2011-10-31T01:30:42  <thestinger> I _think_ that should work if you use exec
2011-10-31T01:31:00  <thestinger> you could also just edit tcpclient.py
2011-10-31T01:31:15  <grom358> gah.. using shell script still didn't fix it

2011-10-31T01:34:10  <thestinger> did you make the script executable and make #!/bin/sh the top line? it should work without that
2011-10-31T01:34:25  <grom358> yeah I made it executable with the shebang
2011-10-31T01:34:41  <grom358> I had to still edit tcpclient.py as above before it worked
2011-10-31T01:34:48  <thestinger> oh well, at least it works :)

2011-10-31T01:41:00  <grom358> i got a bunch of ones where I didn't move.. I'm assuming they from when I was connecting and my bot was failing to start
2011-10-31T01:41:42  <thestinger> pretty much as soon as the game finishes (I think you start looking for a new game as soon as you're eliminated or w/e, so the game might take a while to actually finish)

2011-10-31T02:01:19  <bobbydroptable> got a question. if you have a massive swarm of ants in a spot
2011-10-31T02:01:28  <bobbydroptable> where a food might spawn, does that prevent a food from being spawned?
2011-10-31T02:01:48  <CIA-24> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rf1dc285 / (7 files in 2 dirs): allow for activation/deactivate of submission - http://git.io/mEQUnQ
2011-10-31T02:01:54  <bobbydroptable> or does the food that would normally have spawned there get spawned somewhere else
2011-10-31T02:02:31  <thestinger> grom358: I think it's used to partition the map into small areas so you can run the really scary algorithms in a reasonable amount of time just in those areas
2011-10-31T02:02:44  <thestinger> I could be wrong though
2011-10-31T02:03:31  <grom358> thestinger: ah.. your bot beat me
2011-10-31T02:05:13  <grom358> lol.. i had about 3 ppl come after me
2011-10-31T02:05:23  <grom358> my 4 defenders not enough to stop that lol
2011-10-31T02:05:39  <thestinger> once you get some combat code I think they'll be a lot more useful
2011-10-31T02:05:58  <thestinger> the top bots use 2 ants to kill a whole army of mine :(

2011-10-31T02:09:44  <ChrisH_> bobbydroptable: I'm not 100% sure, but looking at the code in github (https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py  see line 1018) it looks like the food would not be generated
2011-10-31T02:09:45  <thestinger> I recently did a bunch of work on basics like movement which has really improved my bot - my ants used to always line up in a row/column and get massacred
2011-10-31T02:10:30  <bobbydroptable> so clumping ants together can also be a bad thing if it prevent food from spawning in your areas
2011-10-31T02:10:50  <grom358> thestinger: do you have combat code? u took me out with ease

2011-10-31T02:11:04  <ChrisH_> bobbydroptable: yes, it would seem so
2011-10-31T02:11:05  <thestinger> my ants spread out due to my movement code
2011-10-31T02:11:17  <antimatroid1> bobbydroptable: it will wait to spawn there the next time the location is not occupied
2011-10-31T02:11:21  <grom358> do u still use A* to pathfind or something like that?
2011-10-31T02:11:35  <bobbydroptable> antimatroid hmm ok
2011-10-31T02:11:39  <antimatroid1> so yes, leaving ants sitting around statically could prevent you from getting food
2011-10-31T02:11:42  <thestinger> I used to, but I've switch to a new way
2011-10-31T02:11:45  <ChrisH_> antimatroid1: ahh, I didn't gather that from a quick code skim. good to know
2011-10-31T02:11:57  <antimatroid1> this was the fairest way we could come up with in this situations

2011-10-31T02:12:03  <thestinger> before, I would just find one of the shortest paths from ant to target and send them along it
2011-10-31T02:12:21  <thestinger> I just used a step() function to prevent collisions, so they wouldn't move if they were blocked by another ant
2011-10-31T02:12:26  <antimatroid1> this way you can only affect food not spawning where your ants are, not potentially where food can and cannot spawn elsewhere on the map
2011-10-31T02:12:40  <thestinger> I then improved that by moving into locations where my ants are _if_ they have a move order already
2011-10-31T02:13:02  <thestinger> but then I still ended up with ants being _temporarily_ blocked, but not being given another order
2011-10-31T02:13:05  <grom358> yeah I allow them to move to were they if the other ant has decided to move
2011-10-31T02:13:16  <grom358> but its depends on the iteration order if that actually happens
2011-10-31T02:13:21  <thestinger> so now, my step() function returns 3 possible values (yay enums)
2011-10-31T02:13:37  <thestinger> if they were blocked by an idle ant, I stick them on a blocked queue
2011-10-31T02:13:53  <grom358> i'm thinking I need todo moves in two phases
2011-10-31T02:13:57  <thestinger> well, I stick a struct on with the ant + all directions that bring them closer to a target
2011-10-31T02:13:59  <grom358> or even 3 phases
2011-10-31T02:14:04  <antimatroid1> i was going to say, just 2?
2011-10-31T02:14:23  <grom358> yeah.. step one.. mark where u want to move
2011-10-31T02:14:33  <thestinger> so then I can iterate through that list until I go a full iteration w/o moving an ant
2011-10-31T02:14:38  <grom358> step two.. if that space is going to be free move there
2011-10-31T02:14:48  <grom358> step three do something else if its occupied
2011-10-31T02:15:13  <grom358> thestinger: omg.. thank you.. that is way better idea
2011-10-31T02:15:16  <thestinger> I don't use A* anymore, so I get multiple shortest paths to try too, before I stick them on the list of blocked ants
2011-10-31T02:15:41  <grom358> keep looping over moves until no actions were taken
2011-10-31T02:15:47  <thestinger> so I actually try moving them in ALL directions that bring them closer to their target, and only then do I stick them in a list of blocked ants
2011-10-31T02:15:55  <grom358> and there time left on clock

2011-10-31T02:16:26  <grom358> how do you know its gonna make them closer to the target?
2011-10-31T02:16:29  <thestinger> I've actually been testing on the 8 player multi hill maze map with 7 dumb hunter bots so I get 350+ ants sometimes, and I have no speed problems
2011-10-31T02:16:35  <grom358> thestinger: ^
2011-10-31T02:16:41  <thestinger> I test with turntime=80 locally
2011-10-31T02:16:46  <thestinger> oh, I got that from Fluxid :)
2011-10-31T02:17:15  <thestinger> I do something similar to a breadth-first search from each target across the whole map, marking off distances in a 2d array
2011-10-31T02:17:31  <thestinger> so I get real (well, assuming unseen stuff is land) distances, and pathfinding for free
2011-10-31T02:17:38  <thestinger> for _all_ ants to that target
2011-10-31T02:18:09  <thestinger> I still need A* if I just want to send 1 ant to a location for some reason, but I don't do that yet
2011-10-31T02:18:33  <grom358> so for each tile.. you can lookup the distance to a target?
2011-10-31T02:18:37  <thestinger> yeah
2011-10-31T02:18:44  <thestinger> and I can put multiple targets onto the same 2d array
2011-10-31T02:18:53  <thestinger> and the ants will go to the nearest target
2011-10-31T02:19:06  <thestinger> I think Fluxid does that for hills, food and exploration
2011-10-31T02:19:14  <grom358> multiple targets into the same array.. not sure I follow u there
2011-10-31T02:19:50  <thestinger> so, I set hill_map[row][col] to 0 when I find a hill, and do a BFS outwards, incrementing the distance each time
2011-10-31T02:20:02  <thestinger> if I know about multiple enemy hills, I do the same for them on that same map
2011-10-31T02:21:02  <grom358> so an item in the 2d array can have multiple values? one to each hill?
2011-10-31T02:21:15  <grom358> or do u just store the lowest one?
2011-10-31T02:21:22  <thestinger> that ^
2011-10-31T02:21:41  <grom358> so you just move to tile with the least distance to a target?
2011-10-31T02:21:45  <thestinger> yeah
2011-10-31T02:22:02  <thestinger> so for attacking hills my ants will attack the nearest hill - I might change that to concentrate on a hill sometimes
2011-10-31T02:22:10  <grom358> mmm.. so you could weight priority to targets that way too
2011-10-31T02:22:42  <grom358> do you put food onto it as well?
2011-10-31T02:23:09  <thestinger> well, I use 1 map for hill attacking and 1 for exploration
2011-10-31T02:23:16  <ChrisH_> BTW, incase anyone is interested, my bot computes paths/distances much like thestinger, and it is doing rather well.  :)
2011-10-31T02:23:43  <thestinger> for food I can actually get away with making 1 for _each_ food (yay C++), but I only ever have 1 of those at a time
2011-10-31T02:23:55  <thestinger> I reuse the same variable for each of the maps atm
2011-10-31T02:23:57  <grom358> mmm.. this is sounding better than A*.. cause A* only good when dealing with single ants
2011-10-31T02:24:16  <thestinger> I just make a static 2d vector of ints at the start of the game and keep reusing it - my BFS does no dynamic memory allocation
2011-10-31T02:24:45  <thestinger> running a BFS like that for every single food is faster than measuring manhattan distance from each ant to each food for me

2011-10-31T02:25:03  <thestinger> and it gets more realistic info, since manhattan distance doesn't deal with water
2011-10-31T02:25:05  <ChrisH_> And also, incase anyone is interested, I tried to replace BFS with A* hoping it would be faster and it turned out to be slower in the end.
2011-10-31T02:25:11  <thestinger> I don't know java at all xD
2011-10-31T02:25:22  <thestinger> I could probably read it a bit though

2011-10-31T02:31:34  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: OK, I don't see anything obviously wrong in the SQL, you're on your own with the web stuff, not my forte.
2011-10-31T02:31:39  <thestinger> then I got rid of the visited vector they use, because I just stop when the new distance wouldn't be lower than the current in that square
2011-10-31T02:31:55  <thestinger> well, you just read the parent's distance and increment it by 1 for the new node
2011-10-31T02:31:58  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: Also, I'm not that familiar with your DB schema, so I'm just looking for red flags.

2011-10-31T02:32:55  <grom358> oh.. right.. so as the things on the queue have distance.. then as you add the adjacents you set them to 1 more than that

2011-10-31T02:41:23  <thestinger> ccc: 'a' is an int literal in C iirc
2011-10-31T02:41:23  <ccc> C
2011-10-31T02:41:23  <LouisMartin> Is it me or is the server way faster?
2011-10-31T02:41:31  <grom358> thestinger: lol.. now I want to throw everything I done now.. startover
2011-10-31T02:41:39  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I think it makes sense, just suggesting you should avoid surprising the people who care, by posting an explanation on the forums for those that don't read IRC logs.
2011-10-31T02:41:44  <LouisMartin> hmm.. The game scheduler algo changed?
2011-10-31T02:41:48  <thestinger> grom358: I've basically done that a few times :P
2011-10-31T02:42:16  <grom358> that idea just way better.. deals with clusters of ants better
2011-10-31T02:42:41  <LouisMartin> I think it's fair to give priority to those who care enough to go see their profile page.
2011-10-31T02:42:47  <thestinger> it still ends up sending them in a single file line a lot of the time
2011-10-31T02:42:55  <thestinger> it's better, but not ideal
2011-10-31T02:43:08  <grom358> thestinger: yeah.. i been thinking about how to fix that
2011-10-31T02:43:14  <thestinger> I need to weight the distance map or something at corners
2011-10-31T02:43:16  <LouisMartin> Great improvement McLeopold. kudos
2011-10-31T02:43:29  <thestinger> atm, a corner usually results in a big swarm turning into a single line
2011-10-31T02:43:54  <grom358> yeah.. that is what I love about this idea.. can use weights to modify the path that gets travelled
2011-10-31T02:44:10  <thestinger> I was actually weighting my A* search
2011-10-31T02:44:37  <thestinger> I just used the same kind of idea (a 2d vector storing costs)
2011-10-31T02:44:47  <ccc> thestinger: thanks again, it was int indeed
2011-10-31T02:44:48  <thestinger> but I never really started using it before I switched to this
2011-10-31T02:45:14  <thestinger> ccc: yeah, that's actually one of the few differences between C and the subset of C in C++ and has given me trouble before
2011-10-31T02:45:27  <grom358> got to go.. laters
2011-10-31T02:45:31  <thestinger> cya
2011-10-31T02:45:45  <LouisMartin> easy one: what algo enable you to scan the "tiles" in a radius Y at position X ?

2011-10-31T02:46:23  <thestinger> the c++ starter bot uses BFS + euclidean distance to do that

2011-10-31T02:46:47  <thestinger> I think the python starter bot does it a better way, I haven't really looked at how it works yet
2011-10-31T02:47:00  <ccc> thestinger: then what is char llteral in C, why is char even there if the literals are int?
2011-10-31T02:47:15  <LouisMartin> thestinger: there's that in the c++ starter bot?  wow..  far from having this kind of stuff in the C# starter bot.
2011-10-31T02:47:46  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: What happened to the site formatting? Lots of stuff that used to be centered in columns is now all left justified, and there isn't much space between columns, making things run together (at least on FF5).
2011-10-31T02:47:53  <thestinger> LouisMartin: it uses it to mark off which squares are visible, it might be in the C# one too
2011-10-31T02:48:05  <thestinger> ccc: I guess you could do (char)'c'?

2011-10-31T02:48:51  <LouisMartin> thestinger: I get it, but no, it's not there.   BFS + euclidean..  alright, I'll go check the C++ code I guess.  Thanks
2011-10-31T02:49:31  <thestinger> LouisMartin: I actually just linked to it for something else, so it's in my clipboard: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp/State.cc#L75

2011-10-31T02:51:09  <thestinger> LouisMartin: it's actually really damn slow though... the python bot probably has a better example

2011-10-31T02:58:26  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: good point, right now there are about 1000 submissions in the last 24 hours
2011-10-31T02:58:42  <McLeopold> I just deactivated about 4000 out of 8000 submissions
2011-10-31T02:58:43  <ccc> thestinger: I used all the warning options in gcc described here http://pastie.org/2786200, and i removed every single warning. but still the bot crashes at turn 1
2011-10-31T02:58:50  <ChrisH_> ahh, mouse over fail for me. ;)  Especially the difference in game rate for an active bot vs. an inactive one.
2011-10-31T02:59:05  <thestinger> ccc: use valgrind
2011-10-31T03:00:03  <ChrisH_> My "players ahead" stat dropped from ~3000 to ~650 when you made the change.
2011-10-31T03:00:07  <thestinger> ccc: C and C++ really let you shoot yourself in the foot - you could be writing out of bounds of an array, dereferencing a null pointer, etc.

2011-10-31T03:05:20  <thestinger> do you guys assign certain ants to act as food gatherers?
2011-10-31T03:06:04  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I do not, currently my exploring, food gathering, and some hill hunting ants are all in one pool for pathing to targets.
2011-10-31T03:06:35  <thestinger> do you send ants back to places you've already explored to look for food though?
2011-10-31T03:07:28  <ChrisH_> but I currently have a split I don't like, some ants try to avoid enemy ants (the pool just mentioned) and others that are more aggressive and don't mind getting in combat range. Those pools get pathed separately, which causes some behaviors I don't like.
2011-10-31T03:07:51  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: no, I don't want to do that
2011-10-31T03:08:16  <ChrisH_> yes, I consider exploration to be both uncharted territory and not recently seen territory, but they have different priorities.

2011-10-31T03:17:19  <thestinger> are goroutines allowed? I was unsure about that due to the no OS thread/process rule, since they don't use multiple threads by default
2011-10-31T03:18:05  <ChrisH_> I'm pretty sure they would be fine because the compiler used on the servers doesn't use native threads by default, so goroutines should act like green threads in the contest.
2011-10-31T03:18:22  <ChrisH_> But I haven't used them yet, so I can't say for sure.
2011-10-31T03:18:45  <danielharan> playgame has a --profile flag that creates a .profile file; any pointers on how to make sense of it?

2011-10-31T03:24:42  <ChrisH_> me too. I'm still getting used to how interfaces work and how to best utilize them, but they have been slowly dissappearing from my bot code either because they were overkill or proved to have a performance hit in some cases
2011-10-31T03:25:07  <janzert> heh, 3 out of the top 20 are active now
2011-10-31T03:25:08  <ChrisH_> (me too re: liking go that is)
2011-10-31T03:25:32  <thestinger> I think interfaces kill performance because you end up using an extra layer of function calls
2011-10-31T03:25:34  <ChrisH_> janzert: And I'm only active because I was here when the change went live and helped test it.
2011-10-31T03:26:16  <ChrisH_> thestinger: yes, just like virtual methods in C++, but it only REALLY matters for those innermost loops that get run a zillion times
2011-10-31T03:26:43  * janzert nods
2011-10-31T03:26:50  <ChrisH_> thestinger: so my BFS code and that sort of low level stuff is where the interfaces got removed
2011-10-31T03:26:54  <thestinger> yeah, the first thing I did in Go was to make a parallel merge sort and compare it to C - interfaces end up making something like sort over an order of magnitude slower
2011-10-31T03:27:01  <McLeopold> janzert: so, do the changes look good?

2011-10-31T03:29:08  <LouisMartin> There's stuff in there that is helpful and doesn't have to do with actually drawing and saving bitmap file..
2011-10-31T03:29:20  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yeah, I have
2011-10-31T03:29:35  <thestinger> ChrisH_: in the Go code I've written my performance problems were all related to overusing goroutines :P
2011-10-31T03:29:58  <thestinger> they are really cheap now, but chans are definitely not cheap because they do lots of locking/unlocking
2011-10-31T03:30:10  <janzert> next game listing for deactivated players should probably change?
2011-10-31T03:30:24  <ChrisH_> thestinger: yeah, I can believe that, when you think about what they have to do in terms of context switching and syncronization, etc. they are going to have an impact

2011-10-31T03:31:51  <thestinger> ChrisH_: I think things will be a lot better when there's an LLVM frontend - gccgo definitely generates fast code, but it uses 1 thread per goroutine which makes it pretty useless
2011-10-31T03:31:53  <ChrisH_> thestinger: that's why I haven't used goroutines in my bot code yet, I haven't had a real need and didn't want the unpredictability of scheduling.
2011-10-31T03:32:19  <thestinger> I think there's actually a function you can call to pass control to another goroutine

2011-10-31T03:35:03  <danielharan> is the Ruby program causing anyone else headaches? def run in ai is yielding and returning - but then hanging for me

2011-10-31T03:35:31  <thestinger> ChrisH_: well, I think chans are actually a lot cheaper with GOMAXPROCS set to 1 like it is by default, because it's concurrent but not parallel

2011-10-31T03:36:42  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I think you're right.  I use chans in my bots input parsing code, but since that only happens once a turn it is a non-factor performance wise anyway.
2011-10-31T03:36:43  <LouisMartin> janzert: good question. brb googling
2011-10-31T03:36:47  <janzert> actually looks like it does
2011-10-31T03:36:48  <McLeopold> LouisMartin: remember that it is really on mono, and linking is different there
2011-10-31T03:37:08  <thestinger> ChrisH_: they probably don't actually need to use any locking with 1 thread actually
2011-10-31T03:37:47  <ChrisH_> thestinger: no, just force cause a context switch to the code on the other end of the chan.
2011-10-31T03:38:01  <thestinger> you can have buffered chans though
2011-10-31T03:38:02  <ChrisH_> s/force cause/force
2011-10-31T03:38:13  <LouisMartin> McLeopold: you're right. Should look at how mono actually imports. my guess is that it's a parameter at compilation time... which I can't possibly influence.
2011-10-31T03:38:19  <ChrisH_> yep, so only  force the switch when the buffer is full/empty

2011-10-31T03:38:52  <McLeopold> LouisMartin: it's usually in the sln or project file by default, which I believe is ignored
2011-10-31T03:38:56  <janzert> LouisMartin: looks like it is included in the mono graphical interface package which pretty certainly isn't going to be available
2011-10-31T03:39:08  <ChrisH_> and in my case my parsing code uses a buffered chan to send tokens to itself, so it isn't even goroutine switching

2011-10-31T03:39:57  <McLeopold> janzert: so, opinion on the won at link?
2011-10-31T03:40:08  <ChrisH_> thestinger: I could just as easily have done the parsing with slices, but chans required less management
2011-10-31T03:40:32  <janzert> I kind of like to look at it sometimes to judge what games to view, but I don't really care too much either way

2011-10-31T03:41:56  <LouisMartin> McLeopold: Surely ignored, yes. The question is if there's any Mono equivalent that your compilation engine supports, but unless someone on your team tell me, it's a lot of try and error that probably will go nowhere.

2011-10-31T07:11:46  <Migi32> why do some ants randomly disappear from the field?
2011-10-31T07:13:02  <bqf> Migi32: ants don't do that. what you're seeing is probably either a) they're killed or b) they leave your own ants' viewradius.
2011-10-31T07:13:05  <krishna> Migi32: They shouldn't. Are your ants killing each other?
2011-10-31T07:14:05  <Migi32> hmm, no I've definitely seen it happen and it wasn't bqf's a or b

2011-10-31T07:15:47  <Fluxid> Migi32: when two your ants want to go to the same cell
2011-10-31T07:15:53  <Fluxid> they are killed, both, not blocked

2011-10-31T07:16:53  <Migi32> it happened quite a while ago. I thought the ants died after a certain age or something, but today I looked on the specs page for that and didn't find anything
2011-10-31T07:18:21  <HaraKiri> would be awesome of they die when they're old :D

2011-10-31T07:29:45  <Migi32> alright, apparently when an ant dies, its ghost can keep the view radius open for 1 more turn. The dying ants are still visible but they're a really tiny dot. Maybe this confused me.
2011-10-31T07:30:57  <jmcarthur> is this just in the visualizer or in the actual engine?

2011-10-31T07:38:58  <bqf> Migi32: technically the view radius doesn't stay open, you just get a "this ant died" info from the system. since it is your own ant, you get that message even if the area it died in would now be outside of your view radius.
2011-10-31T07:40:04  <Migi32> bqf, ah, then the visualizer is wrong? When you click the button to show what that player can see, it shows the full radius around that ant as visible
2011-10-31T07:41:40  <bqf> Migi32: it does? ok, i'll have to recant what i said above then since i'm not 100% sure. that was just my assumption and i don't have time to dig into the code right now to see whether it is factual. you'd be better of to test it or read the code to make sure. :)
2011-10-31T07:43:19  <HaraKiri> the number of players is unknown to the bot, right?

2011-10-31T08:09:41  <Migi32> I didn't really finish my planet wars bot though. I had the silly goal of either being #1 or fail trying, so when I saw that my approach wouldn't really get me much higher than #10 or so I stopped working on it
2011-10-31T08:10:15  <Migi32> for this contest I won't do that. Just make a good, solid bot that I'm satisfied with, for fun :)
2011-10-31T08:10:42  <Migi32> and then do silly things like making a vortexbot or drawing figures on the field with ants :P

2011-10-31T08:16:56  <Migi32> hmm. FlashM seems to use a lot of 2x2 squares as attack formations. How good are those?

2011-10-31T08:18:38  <Minthos> 1x4 should be better
2011-10-31T08:19:16  <Migi32> how about the tetris T-shape?
2011-10-31T08:20:03  <Migi32> I guess it all depends on the attack radius
2011-10-31T08:20:05  <Minthos> I think a straight line is the best attack formation
2011-10-31T08:20:51  <Minthos> if it gets long, envelop the enemy between several formations and sandwich them
2011-10-31T08:21:54  <bearoff_w> >> ellow and blue in that game do exactly the same  -  there are at least 4 bots doing the same, ha
2011-10-31T08:22:08  <Migi32> true. There's no way to efficiently beat a line formation except with an equally long line, or flanking, right?

2011-10-31T08:23:55  <Migi32> one problem with the line formation though is that it takes a lot of ants, I think
2011-10-31T08:24:17  <Minthos> two adjacent ants is a line
2011-10-31T08:24:23  <Fluxid> how would you keep ants in formation?

2011-10-31T08:25:22  <Migi32> yeah, if you have an Nx1 line, I think better use of those N ants is to spread them out and try to surround the opponent

2011-10-31T08:35:28  <Migi32> on a player's profile, when you click "view more" to see more of that player's recent games, the title says "X's recent games" but the page shows all recent games between all players
2011-10-31T08:35:43  <Migi32> maybe this is a known bug but I thought I'd let you know anyway
2011-10-31T08:36:33  <antimatroid1> Migi32: we have had exactly the same intentions for both contests :D
2011-10-31T08:36:43  <antimatroid1> except i never gave up with pw and only came 36th
2011-10-31T08:36:48  <antimatroid1> that game stumped me :\
2011-10-31T08:37:22  <antimatroid1> once i've finished exams and ridden across tasmania i'm just going to work out what i want my bot to do, write it for fun and leave it at that
2011-10-31T08:37:51  <antimatroid1> i'll have a bit under a month probably
2011-10-31T08:38:01  <Migi32> yeah. Planet wars was a really nice contest though. The rules were so simple that you had the feeling you could "beat" it and write a perfect bot.
2011-10-31T08:38:19  <antimatroid1> yep, i spent a long time trying to "solve" the problem/game
2011-10-31T08:38:41  <antimatroid1> that's also what made it so awesome, it offered a surprisingly simple yet complicated mathematics problem
2011-10-31T08:38:57  <antimatroid1> (simple to understand, complicated to solve)
2011-10-31T08:40:47  <Migi32> yeah. For ants i don't have this feeling. Incomplete information, multiple opponents, far more data, more complicated rules, etc. So I'll just give it a shot, write some heuristics and see how it goes
2011-10-31T08:41:22  <antimatroid1> Migi32: you weren't one of the people i talked to about solving zero sum games with linear progrmming were you?
2011-10-31T08:41:33  <antimatroid1> and possibly the person who actually implemented it and said it was too slow?
2011-10-31T08:42:01  <Migi32> I did talk about it, and I believe mega1 was the person who implemented it and said it was too slow to be useful
2011-10-31T08:42:21  <antimatroid1> i do think ants is perhaps better suited to this type of contest, there's obvious parts of your bot to write and improve which will be noticeable when watching it play
2011-10-31T08:42:42  <antimatroid1> planet wars was very impenetrable after a while and it became very hard to make any noticeable improvements

2011-10-31T08:44:20  <antimatroid1> or == operations research
2011-10-31T08:44:58  <Migi32> heh :)
2011-10-31T08:45:06  <Migi32> it's probably an NP-complete problem though
2011-10-31T08:45:14  <Migi32> or someone would have solved it
2011-10-31T08:45:30  <antimatroid1> i wonder if it's still as hard in one player mode
2011-10-31T08:45:43  <antimatroid1> ie. you have to expand better than other people expand without conflict
2011-10-31T08:45:51  <antimatroid1> well, still hard, not as hard
2011-10-31T08:46:18  <antimatroid1> or was that the knapsack problem? i can't remember :\
2011-10-31T08:46:49  <antimatroid1> i don't think it was that easy
2011-10-31T08:47:24  <antimatroid1> decision tree's would have been the go i think
2011-10-31T08:47:48  <Migi32> not sure. I think it's still NP-complete though
2011-10-31T08:48:01  <Migi32> it's good to see that for ants, the 1st bot is way better than the 2nd. I was a bit afraid that once the bots get to a certain level, a lot of the game would be decided by luck (where the food spawns etc)
2011-10-31T08:48:20  <antimatroid1> i'm still a bit worried about ants just standing off from each other
2011-10-31T08:48:24  <antimatroid1> but so far so good
2011-10-31T08:48:58  <antimatroid1> i'm glad we have the battle resolution that we do
2011-10-31T08:49:11  <antimatroid1> imo the others didn't really offer much strategy wise when it came to battling
2011-10-31T08:49:14  <delt0r> antimatroid1: a few already avoid combat as much as possible
2011-10-31T08:49:26  <antimatroid1> delt0r: yeah i've seen those comments
2011-10-31T08:49:57  <antimatroid1> i'll have my bot take anything where it loses less ants than it helps kill (hopefully)
2011-10-31T08:50:15  <delt0r> if there where points for that then it works
2011-10-31T08:50:18  <delt0r> if not......
2011-10-31T08:50:20  <antimatroid1> still not entirely sure of how i'm going to do that
2011-10-31T08:50:54  <antimatroid1> you might want to weight your willingness to lose ants by the distance to an enemy ant hill?
2011-10-31T08:51:09  <antimatroid1> obviously you'd never want to lose ants to no kills
2011-10-31T08:51:20  <antimatroid1> and your own for defense

2011-10-31T08:52:25  <antimatroid1> delt0r: thesis goes in tomorrow, hand my last exam in next monday, 50 minute talk next thursday, root canal surgery on the friday then riding across tasmania the following monday
2011-10-31T08:52:27  <Migi32> antimatroid1, how could losing an ant for no kills help you save a hill?
2011-10-31T08:52:32  <antimatroid1> then i should have a bit under a month to write a bot :)
2011-10-31T08:52:44  <Minthos> if you always avoid combat you don't get any food if there are more aggressive enemies near you
2011-10-31T08:52:55  <antimatroid1> Migi32: good point :P
2011-10-31T08:53:23  <Minthos> you'll just get driven back into your base and stay walled in or die
2011-10-31T08:53:33  <antimatroid1> i also want to see people divert ants around stand off areas
2011-10-31T08:53:46  <delt0r> that is why i like Nebular ... dark matter squad combat [tm]
2011-10-31T08:53:54  <delt0r> the whole goal is combat
2011-10-31T08:54:08  <antimatroid1> how smart are people's food collection algorithms?
2011-10-31T08:54:09  <delt0r> no pussy footing around like a kitten
2011-10-31T08:54:58  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't send more than one ant to the same food item during beta and would reuse ants each turn when collecting food based on where they'd be from collecting their last food item and when they could move etc.
2011-10-31T08:55:20  <Minthos> mine is pretty smart, but I haven't implemented the better pathfinding I want so I can't distribute my ants as evenly as I would like on the map
2011-10-31T08:55:32  <antimatroid1> Minthos: do you reuse ants while collecting food?
2011-10-31T08:55:46  <Minthos> depends what you mean
2011-10-31T08:55:57  <antimatroid1> ie. if you have
2011-10-31T08:55:58  <antimatroid1> *..a.*
2011-10-31T08:55:58  <antimatroid1> *..a.*
2011-10-31T08:56:04  <antimatroid1> are both a's going right or will one go left?
2011-10-31T08:56:14  <Minthos> one will go left
2011-10-31T08:56:43  <Minthos> I assign one ant to each food

2011-10-31T09:16:37  <Overburn> oh nice
2011-10-31T09:16:39  <bobbydroptable> its not a starter though
2011-10-31T09:16:39  <Overburn> what does it do?
2011-10-31T09:16:49  <thestinger> bobbydroptable: do you have combat stuff implemented?
2011-10-31T09:17:02  <bobbydroptable> nope
2011-10-31T09:17:34  <bobbydroptable> the only thing i had implemented at that stage was just a cheap exploration heuristic and pathing to food
2011-10-31T09:17:42  <bobbydroptable> so all it does it wander around and gobble up food
2011-10-31T09:18:13  <thestinger> yeah, I got up to the same 45-70 range without combat and with crappy pathfinding/swarming
2011-10-31T09:18:32  <bobbydroptable> and i've been trying to rebuild a 2nd bot with less "wandering around" and more deterministic behavior
2011-10-31T09:18:39  <bobbydroptable> but failing thus far
2011-10-31T09:18:42  <thestinger> I uploaded a new version since then (still no combat) and it's climbing back up
2011-10-31T09:19:37  <Overburn> hah so basically with some pathfinding and exploraion and implementing some behaviour that when it sees another hill to attack it it could go pretty high heh
2011-10-31T09:19:40  <bobbydroptable> cool
2011-10-31T09:20:12  <thestinger> yeah, starter bot + doing the tutorial + pathfinding can get you to the top 200 if you don't have timeouts
2011-10-31T09:20:30  <thestinger> I have a feeling that there are a lot of people with better bots but they are just using them on the tcp servers atm
2011-10-31T09:21:15  <bobbydroptable> same
2011-10-31T09:21:17  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-10-31T09:21:25  <Overburn> heh

2011-10-31T09:24:33  <Overburn> you could try parsing the map and pick some areas that are less explored than others
2011-10-31T09:25:07  <Overburn> or check the map for patterns and try to pinpoint where interesting stuff might be
2011-10-31T09:25:10  <thestinger> I end up exploring the map pretty quickly because I pretend unexplored areas are land, so attacking an enemy hill leads to finding closer enemy hills

2011-10-31T09:29:53  <bobbydroptable> isn't combat basically movement as a group
2011-10-31T09:29:53  <thestinger> here's an example http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=38532 (I'm strcat) - this is old code and I do handle it a bit better now
2011-10-31T09:30:19  <thestinger> well, I'm trying to get my ants to move in a way that's more optimal for combat before I venture into the minimax stuff
2011-10-31T09:30:56  <thestinger> I've already improved a lot over what used to happen (they would just form a single file line all the time, often with 1 space gaps)

2011-10-31T09:32:53  <thestinger> if you're sending many ants to a a few targets, you can do a BFS from that target and get pathfinding and distance measurements for all the ants
2011-10-31T09:32:53  <Migi32> is there a way to access our bot's log files when the bot is running on the contest servers?
2011-10-31T09:32:55  <^5> Also harder for a newbie to code
2011-10-31T09:32:58  <Zao> Hierarchial A* is awesome.
2011-10-31T09:33:06  <Overburn> so how do you guys handle movement , you issue orders and then move them all at once or move them as they come?

2011-10-31T09:33:55  <Migi32> I move them as they come, but I'm not sure that that's the best way to do it

2011-10-31T09:34:12  <Overburn> hmm i issue orders but i have a small problem
2011-10-31T09:34:12  <bobbydroptable> A* vs BFS depends on the tradeoffs you want to make.
2011-10-31T09:34:13  <thestinger> I have a step() function that prevents all collisions, so I have to keep track of ants that are blocked by currently idle ants so they can try moving again
2011-10-31T09:34:36  <bobbydroptable> some people have found that A* is slower because you need to compute manhattan distance for all nodes to get your heuristic
2011-10-31T09:34:50  <Overburn> say i want to avoid collision , the only foolproof method i've come up with is to stop the ants that have conflicting next moves and execute one each turn
2011-10-31T09:34:51  <Zao> Having each ant rank the options it has (move in a cardinal dir, do nothing) and have some external coordinator resolve intents tends to be decent.
2011-10-31T09:35:20  <Overburn> i could probably make them go around eachother but can't seem to figure out how to make it not timeout when there are big clustered groups
2011-10-31T09:35:29  <thestinger> Overburn: you can move into a location if the ant there has a move order, so you can deal with that either with fancy computer science or by doing brute force iteration
2011-10-31T09:35:56  <Overburn> oh hmm
2011-10-31T09:36:39  <Overburn> so technically if i move an ant out of a tile and then , in the same turn i move another ant on that tile , there would be no collissions, but if i do it the other way around ( in the same turn ) there will be collisions?
2011-10-31T09:37:07  <thestinger> well, if you assume all ants are going to move you might get collisions because some don't move
2011-10-31T09:37:57  <Migi32> I see in the contest rules that we're not allowed to write to any file. I think it would be better if there was 1 log file we could write to, and let the owner of the bots download their log files
2011-10-31T09:38:25  <thestinger> Migi32: for testing, you can use the unofficial tcp servers
2011-10-31T09:38:42  <thestinger> the site doesn't really play games fast enough to be used for testing code imo
2011-10-31T09:39:24  <thestinger> it's taking 3+ days for me to reach a stable ranking, and I don't want to upload my new version b/c I like seeing how high the current one can get
2011-10-31T09:39:39  <thestinger> new versions* :P
2011-10-31T09:40:15  <Migi32> thestinger: I know, but my local desktop isn't the same as the server. I mainly use my log files to log how long each step of the algorithm takes.
2011-10-31T09:40:45  <Migi32> and those numbers might be way different on the server than on my pc
2011-10-31T09:40:51  <thestinger> I've found it useful to do a local test on the biggest multi-maze map with turntime=50
2011-10-31T09:41:02  <thestinger> I end up with 350+ ants so I'm pretty sure I'll be safe on the server
2011-10-31T09:43:11  <koh_h_h> hi
2011-10-31T09:43:58  <koh_h_h> does the do_turn load once per ant or per turn?

2011-10-31T09:44:07  <Migi32> I test on that map too, but quite often my bot has to interrupt some steps of my algorithm and continue the next turn.

2011-10-31T09:45:06  <koh_h_h> can anyone please tell me does the "do_turn" load once per ant or per turn? tq
2011-10-31T09:45:25  <Migi32> do_turn?

2011-10-31T09:48:03  <Migi32> koh_h_h, you might want to read the comments. Right above where do_turn is defined it says # do turn is run once per turn
2011-10-31T09:49:01  <koh_h_h> ok thanks
2011-10-31T09:49:03  <Migi32> thestinger, I use C++ too. But I'm fairly sure my bot asks for the distance between 2 points far more often than yours :)
2011-10-31T09:49:50  <thestinger> yeah, I don't use A* anymore
2011-10-31T09:50:40  <thestinger> I'll probably use it if I want to send a single ant to a location and I don't care about the distance, but I haven't needed that yet
2011-10-31T09:51:04  <Migi32> what do you use then?
2011-10-31T09:51:30  <thestinger> I've combined a few tricks people talked about in the channel
2011-10-31T09:51:43  <thestinger> if there's a single target, or a few of them and I want to send a bunch of ants to them
2011-10-31T09:52:10  <thestinger> I just do a breadth-first search from the targets and use a 2d array to store the distance to the targets from each tile
2011-10-31T09:52:29  <thestinger> so that gets proper distance measurements + pathfinding for every ant to that target
2011-10-31T09:52:47  <Migi32> do you store that 2d array for if you need it again later?
2011-10-31T09:53:06  <thestinger> well, I actually statically allocate the 2d array at the start of the game and reuse for everything
2011-10-31T09:54:58  <thestinger> I can just get data from it like the distance from ants to targets and the directions that would bring them closer to it and then wipe the array and reuse it for the next thing
2011-10-31T09:56:09  <thestinger> so to attack 1 hill, I'm doing a single BFS and using that to get distance/pathfinding for all my ants
2011-10-31T09:56:15  <Migi32> ok. What I do is similar, but I pre-calculate these arrays for each possible target square and then use those for O(1) lookup. However, there's not enough memory for all of them so I use a few tricks to save memory etc

2011-10-31T09:57:05  <thestinger> I just regenerate the array each turn (once for hills, once for exploration, and a large number of times for food targets)

2011-10-31T09:57:41  <thestinger> the time it takes to do hills and food is negligible, the way I use it for exploration is pretty stupid and it takes 20-30ms on the huge maps
2011-10-31T09:58:30  <thestinger> it takes care of all the pathfinding/distance measurement though so I don't have to run A* or check manhattan distances

2011-10-31T09:59:57  <Migi32> it's the same for me, collecting food and attacking hills takes almost no time. But all the work goes into exploration because I think that that's the deciding factor of how good your bot is
2011-10-31T10:00:23  <BFC> if your bot crashes, what does tha tmean?
2011-10-31T10:00:52  <jcdnyc> It's got a bug :)
2011-10-31T10:01:23  <BFC> and what's an efficient way to debug? :p

2011-10-31T10:01:25  <thestinger> BFC: what language is it?
2011-10-31T10:01:30  <BFC> c++
2011-10-31T10:01:36  <jcdnyc> If it crashes on the server you can download your bot input and feed it to your bot via stdin
2011-10-31T10:01:36  <BFC> it's first time working on such a project
2011-10-31T10:01:48  <thestinger> well, C and C++ can be hard to debug
2011-10-31T10:01:54  <BFC> i know :(
2011-10-31T10:02:08  <thestinger> valgrind and libmudflap are useful if it's stuff like going out of bounds in an array
2011-10-31T10:02:10  <jcdnyc> on the visualizer in the lower right is a button "BOT -> IN"
2011-10-31T10:02:39  <Migi32> BFC, do you use an IDE? Eclipse CDT has a very good debugger
2011-10-31T10:02:53  <BFC> i use eclipes
2011-10-31T10:02:55  <BFC> *eclipse
2011-10-31T10:02:58  <jcdnyc> use that to generate the messages the engine sent your bot during the games.  Your could should probably crash the same way locally with the same input
2011-10-31T10:03:42  <thestinger> yeah, and use valgrind :P
2011-10-31T10:04:05  <thestinger> there are often bugs like invalid reads/writes that stay hidden and don't cause problems 99% of the time

2011-10-31T10:05:03  <thestinger> if you're mostly using the standard library containers and stuff in C++, you won't have _as many_ of those problems
2011-10-31T10:05:07  <Migi32> BFC: ok, good. Make sure that your makefile includes debugging options (-g and -DDEBUG) and doesn't have the optimizing flags (-O2, -O3, -funroll-loops etc). Then clean & build, then click the bug icon and paste the but input to start debugging

2011-10-31T10:06:00  <BFC> okay, will try that!
2011-10-31T10:06:31  <thestinger> also, turn on ALL the sane compiler warnings
2011-10-31T10:06:59  <thestinger> g++ -Wall only turns on warnings that are useful 99% of the time
2011-10-31T10:07:16  <Migi32> what others do you suggest then?
2011-10-31T10:07:21  <thestinger> there are other very useful warnings, but they generate a lot of noise so they aren't in -Wall
2011-10-31T10:07:39  <thestinger> -Wall -Wextra is a good start, but stuff like -Wstrict-overflow=5 is very useful imo
2011-10-31T10:08:11  <thestinger> -Wconversion is annoying as hell if you aren't used to it because it won't let you do implicit conversions, but it often catches stuff you didn't mean to do
2011-10-31T10:08:13  <thestinger> etc.
2011-10-31T10:09:05  <Migi32> yeah. -Wconversion gives a warning if you do this: unsigned short x = 5; x++;
2011-10-31T10:09:23  <thestinger> yeah, but you just stick static_cast<> in there and silence it
2011-10-31T10:09:32  *** amanforindia <amanforindia!~aman@14.139.82.6> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-31T10:09:47  <Migi32> the proper way to do x++ according to -Wconversion is x = (unsigned short)(x+1);
2011-10-31T10:10:22  <Minthos> sounds like an annoying warning, I'd keep it off
2011-10-31T10:10:30  <Migi32> and I guess -Wstrict-overflow=5 has something to say about that one too?
2011-10-31T10:10:33  <Minthos> but valgrind is essential
2011-10-31T10:12:59  <thestinger> Migi32: -Wconversion doesn't give me a warning about that (in C++)
2011-10-31T10:13:05  <thestinger> I think it's more annoying in C
2011-10-31T10:13:42  <thestinger> in C++ the most annoying thing is that it makes you explicitly do something like (double)x / (double)y instead of (double)x / y
2011-10-31T10:13:59  <thestinger> assuming x and y are ints
2011-10-31T10:14:15  <rabidus> (double)(x/y) ?
2011-10-31T10:14:27  <rabidus> ahh, nvrmnd
2011-10-31T10:14:54  <thestinger> -Weffc++ is the most annoying warning ever imo
2011-10-31T10:15:32  <Minthos> implicit casts are a good thing, syntactic sugar is a good thing
2011-10-31T10:15:57  <thestinger> well, python3 moved away from that for division
2011-10-31T10:16:05  <Migi32> the most useful debugging tool for me if you're using gcc is defining _GLIBCXX_DEBUG
2011-10-31T10:16:14  <thestinger> there's / and // (integer division) now
2011-10-31T10:16:19  <thestinger> and that's a language with a lot of sugar
2011-10-31T10:16:19  <Minthos> I'd rather not have to type twice as much to avoid 10% of simple mistakes
2011-10-31T10:16:46  <luizribeiro> thestinger: python 2.7 also supports the // operator
2011-10-31T10:16:49  <Migi32> _GLIBCXX_DEBUG makes the standard library containers do out-of-bounds checking, and check for invalid iterators ets
2011-10-31T10:16:51  <Migi32> etc*
2011-10-31T10:17:03  <thestinger> luizribeiro: yeah, and you can from __future__ import stuff anyway

2011-10-31T10:17:18  <thestinger> so you can get / to act like py3
2011-10-31T10:18:14  <Minthos> I mean, when I can just as easily use the wrong variable (but of the right type) somewhere, it doesen't matter if I have to explicitly cast it, the value will still be wrong

2011-10-31T10:27:54  <Minthos> pgpaskar_: not sure what you're referring to, but my solution is to copy the files with bash and search/replace them with vim

2011-10-31T10:54:35  <antimony> I made a post on teh forums about that

2011-10-31T10:54:46  <antimony> it's a one line change to fix it for executables

2011-10-31T10:56:22  <pedrosorio> yes
2011-10-31T10:56:28  <roflmao> inside tutorial.sh you have you use "python bot1/MyBot.py"

2011-10-31T10:57:38  <pedrosorio> the thing is

2011-10-31T10:58:45  <roflmao> well that might be because of thje way you packaged the executable or something? :P

2011-10-31T11:25:06  <antimony> I think the maps are designed to make that difficult
2011-10-31T11:25:15  <antimony> there are some chokepoints that can be defended perfectly
2011-10-31T11:25:20  <Fluxid> yay, 11th place

2011-10-31T11:34:41  <HypnoGenX> Aye, even if I give it 10 seconds per round. So I just cut that sucker off and return the 'path so far' when time is running out.
2011-10-31T11:34:55  <roflmao> heh
2011-10-31T11:35:07  <roflmao> and did that fix the problem?
2011-10-31T11:35:10  <Redgis> within 500ms, I wonder with how many ants you can afford to do A*
2011-10-31T11:35:23  <HypnoGenX> Gets my ants moving in the appropriate direction.
2011-10-31T11:35:23  <roflmao> depends on how well you scheme things
2011-10-31T11:35:29  <HypnoGenX> And it works now, with a handful of ants.
2011-10-31T11:35:32  <avdg> I wonder if it would be a bug rather than a slow implementation
2011-10-31T11:35:38  <HypnoGenX> By the time I have 40 ants they become dumb as bricks. >:-P
2011-10-31T11:35:38  <roflmao> yes it could be a bug hypno
2011-10-31T11:35:49  <roflmao> check the size of your open set
2011-10-31T11:36:00  <HypnoGenX> Was over 400 at one point last night.
2011-10-31T11:36:04  <avdg> I had to remove my optimized loop already because a timeout bug
2011-10-31T11:36:07  <roflmao> then you're doing something wrong :)
2011-10-31T11:36:20  <roflmao> well depends on the distance of course but your open set shouldn't be that large

2011-10-31T12:32:42  <McLeopold> ikaros: I would suggest not having your own hill in sight is not smart
2011-10-31T12:32:56  <pairofdice> Depends on the map I guess
2011-10-31T12:32:58  <ikaros> sometimes its just overrun
2011-10-31T12:33:08  <ikaros> and your ants die first.. so
2011-10-31T12:33:21  <ikaros> what i wanted to do is switch priorities if i have no hill left
2011-10-31T12:33:27  <ikaros> no reason to collect food then
2011-10-31T12:33:38  <McLeopold> if you think you should have spawned an ant, but didn't, that is an indication
2011-10-31T12:33:41  <mayanks43> Actually my deactivated bot went quite high in the ranklist :P
2011-10-31T12:33:56  <ikaros> yea McLeopold
2011-10-31T12:33:57  <Minthos> in the beginning you have no choice but to go exploring, but after you reach a certain number of ants you can post guards to protect your hill
2011-10-31T12:34:13  <ikaros> true Minthos but they still can die before the hill falls :)
2011-10-31T12:34:23  <McLeopold> the more food you collect, the more guards you have :)
2011-10-31T12:34:27  <Minthos> then I don't think it matters much what you do
2011-10-31T12:34:47  <ikaros> i guess watching food and spawn is the only way

2011-10-31T13:14:58  <delt0r> overburn: for this comp, flood fill and left/right painters method are perhaps something to look into
2011-10-31T13:15:15  <overburn> hmm thanks for the tip mate

2011-10-31T13:15:31  <delt0r> the last one is hard to find references on... it is used for RTS games to find the closest enemy unit
2011-10-31T13:15:42  <delt0r> on a gird like here
2011-10-31T13:16:25  <ikaros> is that better than kd-trees to find nearest neighbours?
2011-10-31T13:17:04  <delt0r> on a grid yes
2011-10-31T13:17:12  <delt0r> well a smaller gird
2011-10-31T13:17:16  <delt0r> aka finite
2011-10-31T13:18:05  <delt0r> kd trees work well for very large spaces and/or large numbers of points in low dimension.
2011-10-31T13:18:39  <delt0r> in high dimension it is a unsolved problem--for those that need to know ;)

2011-10-31T13:19:35  <roflmao> most RTS games precompute paths :P
2011-10-31T13:19:47  <delt0r> well in that case we don't have anything that works much better than brute force
2011-10-31T13:20:04  <HypnoGenX> *groan*
2011-10-31T13:20:06  <delt0r> roflmao: yes and no. Most hack the crap out of it
2011-10-31T13:20:17  <roflmao> what do you mean?
2011-10-31T13:20:21  <HypnoGenX> Just spent half an hour tracking down a bug in my A*, which turned out to be the time cap and me telling the engine I want only 100ms roundtimes.
2011-10-31T13:20:33  <Minthos> brute force can be pretty usful if applied right
2011-10-31T13:20:42  <delt0r> roflmao: lots of cheats and shortcuts and hacks.
2011-10-31T13:20:51  <roflmao> how can you hack pathfinding and cheat
2011-10-31T13:21:01  <delt0r> for example some games use crude algos when you have a lot of units
2011-10-31T13:21:13  <delt0r> while they use good ones when you have few
2011-10-31T13:21:13  <overburn> the designer could place various markers on the map i guess for one
2011-10-31T13:21:29  <roflmao> makes sense
2011-10-31T13:21:47  <delt0r> almost none take other units into account --regardless of what the sales pitch claims.
2011-10-31T13:23:11  <Minthos> I suppose you could mark tiles along a path with time reservations based on estimated time the unit will be there
2011-10-31T13:23:17  <delt0r> roflmao: cheating mostly involves really stupid paths. Ie going the long way round right past the enemy base
2011-10-31T13:23:29  <roflmao> ah
2011-10-31T13:23:30  <Minthos> and take that into account when doing subsequent path searches for other units to avoid collision
2011-10-31T13:23:34  <roflmao> well yeah a lot of rts games have terrible pathfinding
2011-10-31T13:23:40  <roflmao> its one of the most common problems
2011-10-31T13:23:42  <delt0r> Minthos: yep.
2011-10-31T13:23:53  <delt0r> few papers on it... quite high complexity
2011-10-31T13:24:17  <Migi32> oh wow turntime on ants.fluxid.pl is 5 seconds?
2011-10-31T13:24:19  <Migi32> Does that server also account for network lag or do we have to do that locally?
2011-10-31T13:24:35  <roflmao> wait. fluxid gives your bot 5 seconds instead of 300ms?
2011-10-31T13:24:37  <delt0r> that 5 sec includes lag
2011-10-31T13:24:48  <roflmao> 500ms*
2011-10-31T13:24:55  <delt0r> last year the tcp server was 3 sec for lag

2011-10-31T13:25:29  <Migi32> yeah but how should my bot be able to tell if there's a network in between him and the server?
2011-10-31T13:25:37  <Fluxid> with 500ms 90% of players would timeout
2011-10-31T13:25:45  <Minthos> your client won't know what the latency is so you'd better assume the time limit is 500 ms or less even when server reports 5 s
2011-10-31T13:25:54  <Fluxid> Minthos: hardcode 500ms then
2011-10-31T13:26:01  <Minthos> what I meant

2011-10-31T13:26:05  <Migi32> I know, but Fluxid you have to tell the bots they have 500ms time and do the 5s check on server-side

2011-10-31T14:14:27  <roflmao> yea its my scavenging plan
2011-10-31T14:14:35  <roflmao> right now it is just random direction which aint too great
2011-10-31T14:14:50  <roflmao> cause all my ants cluster at my hillhorribly
2011-10-31T14:15:18  <roflmao> what I want to do is have the ant choose a direction
2011-10-31T14:15:32  <roflmao> and then keep on going to that direction until the ant bumps into a wall or another ant
2011-10-31T14:15:36  <roflmao> then it switches direction
2011-10-31T14:15:45  <roflmao> that will force all the ants to go out of the hill
2011-10-31T14:16:10  <ikaros> yea i use a similar technique right now
2011-10-31T14:16:27  <ikaros> just planning to upgrade it since it explores to slowly on some maps
2011-10-31T14:16:40  <ThatGuy_> you should try getting your ants to spread over the map, keeping each ant at x distance from each other, where x is just inside of the range required to overlap sight

2011-10-31T15:11:18  <ikaros> If a game consists of a dominant ant that isn't killing of the opponent or razing enemy hills, then the game is cutoff. It is assumed that the bot would probably not lose the lead and just isn't sophisticated enough to go in for the kill. If the total amount of live ants for the dominant bot is 90% of the count of food and ants for 150 turns then the cutoff is invoked.
2011-10-31T15:11:31  <gcflymoto> Zannick: yes it rejects repeated orders

2011-10-31T15:31:12  <Zannick> at least it should fail during testing if it fails at all
2011-10-31T15:31:29  <cyphase> and with relatively little work it can drastically improve performance

2011-10-31T15:35:55  <Migi32> if people do very weird things in their destructors, then c++0x's rvalue references and implicit move constructor may change the meaning of their program

2011-10-31T15:36:42  <amstan> Zannick: i meant it as a general advice
2011-10-31T15:36:47  <Zannick> yeah
2011-10-31T15:36:59  <janzert> btw, I'm more inclined to simply add it to existing because I know c++ is extremely careful about backward compatibility in general
2011-10-31T15:37:01  <amstan> is it just me or does this link refuse to work: http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/files/latest/download?_test=goal
2011-10-31T15:38:09  <Zannick> the wikipedia page indicates that they strive to be compatible with c++98
2011-10-31T15:38:10  <Migi32> so yeah, -std=c++0x may cause issues for like 0.1% of the current C++ bots. For me it's fine either way.
2011-10-31T15:38:13  <Zannick> which is c++
2011-10-31T15:38:40  <Zannick> i'd guess it's probably okay, but i'm not c++0x guy

2011-10-31T15:45:27  <janzert> but if that is likely to still miss subtle problems I'm not sure if that's sufficient to ok the change anyway :/

2011-10-31T15:47:22  <Migi32> janzert, if gcc 4.5.2 were a perfect c++0x compiler, I would just add the -std=c++0x option, but look at what the error message it gives:

2011-10-31T16:20:24  <NefariousZhen_> when I modify sql/2_generate_matchup.sql I don't have to restart for my changes to take effect, right?
2011-10-31T16:20:27  <Migi32> hurray!
2011-10-31T16:20:28  <janzert> that won't be live until later tonight probably
2011-10-31T16:20:41  <Migi32> ah ok
2011-10-31T16:21:09  <janzert> NefariousZhen_: you need to load the changes into the database
2011-10-31T16:21:37  <janzert> something like "mysql -u contest aichallenge < sql/2_generate_matchup.sql" would do it
2011-10-31T16:21:44  <NefariousZhen_> excellent
2011-10-31T16:22:14  <Migi32> janzert: quickly looking at those changes, it looks like you've added -std=c++0x to the linker options and not the build options?
2011-10-31T16:22:32  <Migi32> oh no, sorry, nevermind
2011-10-31T16:22:39  <janzert> the first line should be build...
2011-10-31T16:22:41  <janzert> :)
2011-10-31T16:23:05  <Migi32> yeah I was confused, I thought -funroll-loops was a linker option for a second there
2011-10-31T16:23:37  <Migi32> but... any estimates on when I can resubmit my bot?
2011-10-31T16:23:59  <janzert> probably 6-8 hours from now I would guess
2011-10-31T16:24:21  <Migi32> ok

2011-10-31T16:33:02  <ikaros> oh c++ file extension needs to be .cc?
2011-10-31T16:34:10  <janzert> Your main file has to be MyBot.cc other files can use .cpp, etc.

2011-10-31T16:34:52  <janzert> .cpp or .c I guess
2011-10-31T16:34:59  <ikaros> ah ok
2011-10-31T16:35:06  <ikaros> need to refactor that then
2011-10-31T16:35:35  <ikaros> ported from lua to c++ but tried no submission so far..
2011-10-31T16:35:55  <janzert> later on tonight .cpp will be recognized as C++11 so will most likely just work as well
2011-10-31T16:36:16  <janzert> MyBot.cpp that is
2011-10-31T16:36:49  <antonh> What size is the smallest valid map in the contest?
2011-10-31T16:37:53  <ikaros> well i ignored c++11 cause i thought it wouldnt be allowed :) .. guess i wont refactor again
2011-10-31T16:38:05  <janzert> antonh: there is no limit but I believe the smallest current one is around 70x70
2011-10-31T16:38:53  <pedrosorio> ikaros: have you tried to run your cpp bot locally from a subfolder?

2011-10-31T16:39:43  <ikaros> what exactly do you mean?
2011-10-31T16:40:15  <Migi32> ugh... I renamed my .cc files to .cpp and "make clean" removed my .cpp files... :/
2011-10-31T16:40:30  <pedrosorio> if you are testing your c++ bot
2011-10-31T16:40:33  <antonh> janzert, ok, thanks. There is no rules about how small a map can be?

2011-10-31T16:41:07  <BFC> when I change maps, it just does 1 round, and quits, with "extermination"
2011-10-31T16:41:09  <BFC> what am I doing wrong?
2011-10-31T16:41:10  <janzert> don't think the question has even come up before :)

2011-10-31T16:42:54  <pedrosorio> ikaros: could you do it? because when I try to run my cpp bot from another folder, it "fails to start"
2011-10-31T16:42:55  <ikaros> pedrosorio, http://pastebin.com/h1XW3Pe7 it looks like this and i invoke it with ./blabla -m mapname
2011-10-31T16:42:59  <janzert> and you're sure you have a good map file?
2011-10-31T16:43:10  <ikaros> it's just one example for a 2 player game

2011-10-31T16:44:52  <janzert> should be able to use any valid map but not as  a scenario unless you preadd food and ants to it
2011-10-31T16:45:06  <BFC> ow
2011-10-31T16:45:12  <BFC> should I remove --scenario then?
2011-10-31T16:45:27  <janzert> yes, then the engine will add initial food and ants on the hills
2011-10-31T16:45:43  <BFC> is there a guide where all the options are explained?

2011-10-31T17:01:12  <Migi32> the current c++ makefile is actually quite dangerous. If you rename all your .cc files to .cpp and replace .cc by .cpp everywhere in that makefile, "make clean" deletes all your .cpp files
2011-10-31T17:01:37  <Migi32> luckily I had a recent backup, but not all people that want to switch from c++98 to c++0x do

2011-10-31T18:08:06  <roflmao> yes
2011-10-31T18:08:12  <roflmao> because the dir is just random so they cluster
2011-10-31T18:08:14  <roflmao> then get all stuck
2011-10-31T18:08:17  <roflmao> I'll be fixing that tonight
2011-10-31T18:08:19  <roflmao> easy fix
2011-10-31T18:08:25  <amstan> roflmao: also.. you should keep a bunch of ants inside your area, don't just move them to your fov limit
2011-10-31T18:08:34  <amstan> you need to continue eating food
2011-10-31T18:08:51  <roflmao> it timed out

2011-10-31T18:13:40  <NefariousZhen_> that's exactly what I have in my current version for hills, but have some extra features I want to not post on github =) - so I'll send it once I get home as long as those trick or treaters don't get in my way

2011-10-31T19:21:03  <Venom> I'm not saying the radius should be an integer, rather, I'm asking why it got decimals since where in a grid
2011-10-31T19:21:09  <amstan> Venom: but what happens when you have to tell if the distance of (2,3) from the origin is less than 7
2011-10-31T19:21:23  <amstan> Venom: you need the get euclidean on it, then sqrt, and you have a float again

2011-10-31T20:03:44  <magiik> IIRC the test tools might need to be slightly modified to get them to work right
2011-10-31T20:03:49  <magiik> things like locations of things etc
2011-10-31T20:04:16  <magiik> and i thought u had to give test_bot the command to execute your bot
2011-10-31T20:04:20  <magiik> like "python MyBot.py" or something
2011-10-31T20:04:36  <Zannick> yes
2011-10-31T20:04:56  <magiik> and at least looking at the windows .cmd/batch file, the paths are wrong, and expect you to be in the same dir as the tools
2011-10-31T20:05:34  <Zannick> well, you open a terminal and you cd to the tools directory
2011-10-31T20:05:40  <rogue780> Minthos, I'm just using the tools one, which is in python
2011-10-31T20:06:25  <Minthos> well like I said, read the source for the script, maybe look at play_one_game.sh for clues
2011-10-31T20:06:31  <magiik> Zannick: well... judging by play_one_game's use of the %~dp0 macro, it woudl seem you run it out of the bot directory

2011-10-31T20:07:36  <magiik> and IIRC the tools need python 2.7, even if you are using the python 3 starter pack

2011-10-31T20:28:29  <janzert> now when your ant is within spawn radius of food another ant is added to the queue to spawn at your hill(s)
2011-10-31T20:28:37  <ccc> Venom: the spawnradius is like food radius, as soon as your ant gets within it you hill will spawn an extra ant
2011-10-31T20:28:56  <janzert> hence the note in the specification about spawnradius2 # food gathering radius squared (name is an unfortunate historical artifact)

2011-10-31T20:29:36  <roflmao> does your bot automatically lose if it times out?

2011-10-31T20:29:49  <janzert> theoretically of course it could change, but it is quite unlikely to
2011-10-31T20:30:12  <Venom> ok, thanks.
2011-10-31T20:30:41  <ccc> it doesn't even matter to take spawnradius seriously, if an ant is within it the food disappears anyway, why are you so concerned about it
2011-10-31T20:30:55  <janzert> basically it's use is if you are considering how close to food you need to get an ant when trying to optimize ant pathing
2011-10-31T20:32:42  <ccc> what is the sane method to not get timed-out? should i be using SIGALARM or something like that? any hints
2011-10-31T20:33:20  <Migi32> what happens if a food wants to spawn on a certain location, but an ant is there already?
2011-10-31T20:35:06  <ccc> Migi32: i would think the engine won't spawn there

2011-10-31T20:36:51  <janzert> I know the engine won't spawn, I think it gets added to a queue to spawn when the square is empty but I don't remember for sure
2011-10-31T20:36:52  <Migi32> i ask this because when it spawns next to an ant, it still takes 1 full turn to gather, and my bot tries to move an ant on top of that food but the engine complains that it can't do that
2011-10-31T20:37:08  <Migi32> ah ok
2011-10-31T20:37:31  <janzert> right, moving onto food is blocked
2011-10-31T20:37:53  <janzert> McLeopold: would be the one to ask about the details
2011-10-31T20:38:00  <ccc> hmm, interesting, the food capture happens in the next turn
2011-10-31T20:38:28  <antimatroid1> i think the testing thing will reject your bot if it tries to move onto water
2011-10-31T20:38:36  <cyphase> yea
2011-10-31T20:38:44  <Migi32> it's a bit weird: if a food spawns 2 squares away or 1 square away, you get it at the same time
2011-10-31T20:39:00  <cyphase> and also (i think) if you try to move a non-existent or enemy ant

2011-10-31T21:15:53  <Venom> Thanks magiik. Do you happens to know what [food_rate:	5, 11] mean?
2011-10-31T21:16:15  <avdg> it can have different options
2011-10-31T21:16:17  <magiik> # of food per turn per player
2011-10-31T21:16:27  <magiik> do a python playgame.py
2011-10-31T21:16:30  <magiik> to see options and descriptions
2011-10-31T21:16:56  <magiik> not sure of the specifics/exacts
2011-10-31T21:17:05  <magiik> like wtf --food_turn is for
2011-10-31T21:17:19  <magiik> Denominator of food per turn per player rate
2011-10-31T21:17:22  <magiik> ???
2011-10-31T21:17:53  <magiik> ohhhhh
2011-10-31T21:17:57  <magiik> numerator + denominator = food rate
2011-10-31T21:17:57  <magiik> ok
2011-10-31T21:18:01  <magiik> or rather over
2011-10-31T21:18:20  <magiik> so food rate = food_rate/food_turn ( per player )
2011-10-31T21:18:28  <Venom> okay, thx. I'll go take a look at the options of playgame.py
2011-10-31T21:18:30  <magiik> well actually wtf is "player reate"
2011-10-31T21:18:32  <luizribeiro> any idea when ants.fluxid.pl will be back?

2011-10-31T21:18:53  <magiik> not player rate prolly
2011-10-31T21:19:54  <Venom> ok, so 5/11 chances of food per player per turn?   sounds too little to me

2011-10-31T21:22:36  <magiik> you could always run it, and check the replay to see if it looks right

2011-10-31T21:26:22  <grom358> how much processing power are we getting for our bot? just wondering cause doing performance tests here and my bot runs in under 100ms
2011-10-31T21:26:31  <grom358> locally that is
2011-10-31T21:27:32  <Venom> "Attack method to use for engine. (closest, focus, support, damage)"   Is those attack method documented somewhere?
2011-10-31T21:27:39  <pairofdice> This is hard >_<
2011-10-31T21:27:41  <Venom> *Are those attacks
2011-10-31T21:30:04  <Venom> It's rather pertinent to know how the engine process attacks. I understand that the guesswork create some challenge for the gen algo people, but ...  What's "Focus"?

2011-10-31T22:04:09  <ChrisH_> janzert, McLeopold actually it's worse than that, because that is 1200 active starter bots over a three day span, which could pull another 5000 deactivated starter bots in to games, for a total of 6200 starter bots still getting games.
2011-10-31T22:04:47  <ChrisH_> janzert: McLeopold approximately
2011-10-31T22:06:07  <ChrisH_> janzert: McLeopold which means there either needs to be a big drop in new starter bot submissions, or a lot of time goes by before the mechanism actually has the intended affect of reducing starter bot games

2011-10-31T22:18:05  <grom358> you shouldn't hard code how many to run per turn.. use a queue
2011-10-31T22:18:26  <grom358> just keep popping off the queue while getAnts().getRemainingTime() says you have enough time left

2011-10-31T22:24:24  <grom358> well.. going to you BFS to mark each tile with distance to targets. The ant just moves to tile which results in it being closer to the target
2011-10-31T22:24:50  <magiik> interesting idea
2011-10-31T22:24:56  <roflmao> oh so kind of keep a cache of the computed heuristics
2011-10-31T22:25:02  <magiik> i've been trying to think of a better way than all of this pathfinding
2011-10-31T22:25:09  <magiik> because ideally i want ants coming in a "line"

2011-10-31T22:25:32  <grom358> roflmao: how so?
2011-10-31T22:25:35  <roflmao> if you just move to tile that has a smaller estimate
2011-10-31T22:25:41  <magiik> from target, grow increasing dist by 1 each square
2011-10-31T22:25:46  <grom358> no.. not an estimate.. BFS
2011-10-31T22:25:57  <roflmao> then you cache the bfs?
2011-10-31T22:25:59  <grom358> not using straight distance.. it based on actual distance
2011-10-31T22:26:09  <Guest39322> I have no defence logic either
2011-10-31T22:26:25  <magiik> i kind of like that idea
2011-10-31T22:26:30  <grom358> yes I can cache the results.. thought needs to be updated as I discover new water tiles
2011-10-31T22:26:38  <magiik> i've been trying to figure out a way to just kill memory but not cpu
2011-10-31T22:26:38  <grom358> but its fast anyway
2011-10-31T22:26:39  <ChrisH_> guys, grom's idea will work, it's what my bot does, and I recompute the targets and BFS every turn too
2011-10-31T22:26:58  <magiik> interesting
2011-10-31T22:27:00  <magiik> even on a huge map?
2011-10-31T22:27:31  <grom358> yes I tested on biggest map I could find
2011-10-31T22:27:37  <grom358> its fast
2011-10-31T22:27:45  <magiik> i might steal your idea ;)
2011-10-31T22:27:49  <magiik> at least to test in a version or two
2011-10-31T22:27:52  <ChrisH_> yeah, I get a few timeouts, but they are not really because of the BFS, it's due to a more complicated interaction that keeps my ants dancing instead of making progress
2011-10-31T22:28:03  <magiik> haha i have similar issues
2011-10-31T22:28:07  <roflmao> i think everyone does
2011-10-31T22:28:09  <grom358> and you doing it for all ants at the same time..
2011-10-31T22:28:20  <grom358> no A* for each ant.. so it ends up faster
2011-10-31T22:28:21  <magiik> try to move 100 ants on the same path - backwards and forwards - cause collisions + dump logic to re-path after sidestepping
2011-10-31T22:28:21  <roflmao> even the proest bots have huge clusters by end of game
2011-10-31T22:28:24  <magiik> i get similar shit
2011-10-31T22:28:45  <ChrisH_> the advantage of BFS over A* is that you don't have to compute the heuristic function. I tried A* and it was slower than my BFS code, even when both were heavily tuned
2011-10-31T22:28:54  <roflmao> really?
2011-10-31T22:29:01  <roflmao> even with a dead simple heuristic like manhattan?
2011-10-31T22:29:07  <magiik> i have problems with A* with huge numbers of ants, i kind of like BFS
2011-10-31T22:29:14  <roflmao> i thought just having to sort through bigger sets as BFS
2011-10-31T22:29:17  <roflmao> would cause more problems
2011-10-31T22:29:29  <roflmao> since bfs gives you waaaaaaay bigger open and closed sets
2011-10-31T22:29:50  <ChrisH_> yep, because of dealing with the wrap around affect, and also because I was trying to guide many ants to any one of many targets, the heuristic became O(n^2)
2011-10-31T22:30:13  <roflmao> still don't understand the O(N) stuff
2011-10-31T22:30:18  <roflmao> (I'm very new to all of this)
2011-10-31T22:30:22  <magiik> it's a math thing
2011-10-31T22:30:29  <grom358> trust me.. A* is only one small part. There so many problems to deal with.. BFS ends up being faster
2011-10-31T22:30:30  <magiik> worst case operation time
2011-10-31T22:30:46  <magiik> damn... kind of have to throw a lot of what i've already done out with that heh ;)
2011-10-31T22:30:56  <magiik> but oh well, such is programming
2011-10-31T22:31:01  <magiik> good times
2011-10-31T22:31:03  <grom358> with BFS you can calculate paths for all ants to target at once
2011-10-31T22:31:07  <ChrisH_> I use a heap as a priority queue in the BFS, so no sorting through huge open or closed sets, just pop the next closes entry in O(log n), mark it done, then put the unfinished neighbors on the heap in O(log n)
2011-10-31T22:31:14  <magiik> not even calculate paths - just the next step
2011-10-31T22:31:18  <ChrisH_> exactly grom
2011-10-31T22:31:39  <magiik> more like a full map flow to the target drain
2011-10-31T22:31:47  <magiik> just have the ants follow the flow direction
2011-10-31T22:31:54  <roflmao> with BFS you can calculate paths for all ants to target at once
2011-10-31T22:32:01  <roflmao> but how do you reuse paths?
2011-10-31T22:32:03  <magiik> how many targets do you guys calculate with BFS in your bots?
2011-10-31T22:32:04  <grom358> and you can choose different paths based on whatever logic you want
2011-10-31T22:32:05  <ChrisH_> but I also did some tricks like stopping the BFS early when it found a goal, then erasing that part of the map for that goal so I could continue searching for other goals without restarting the whole BFS
2011-10-31T22:32:12  <roflmao> given a huge 127x127 maze
2011-10-31T22:32:13  <roflmao> that's
2011-10-31T22:32:25  <burny> dynamic waypoints ftw
2011-10-31T22:32:27  <roflmao> 16 thousand possibilities
2011-10-31T22:32:34  <roflmao> i don't possibly see how any of them would be reusable :p[
2011-10-31T22:32:48  <grom358> what.. well enemy hills don't move for starters
2011-10-31T22:32:57  <roflmao> yeah but for food

2011-10-31T22:33:08  <magiik> well a* for food ;)
2011-10-31T22:33:09  <roflmao> ergo the bfs from 15:3 to 19:6 is a one time thing only
2011-10-31T22:33:11  <magiik> sinec food only needs 1 ant
2011-10-31T22:33:18  <magiik> why do a pathfinding that benefits all ants?
2011-10-31T22:33:18  <roflmao> yeah I'm talking about food :P
2011-10-31T22:33:20  <ChrisH_> I have a goal for each enemy hill, each food I know about, each exploration target, and each defensive position. Then I have all my ants on the other end of the search.

2011-10-31T22:33:39  <grom358> yeah limit food to vision radius
2011-10-31T22:33:44  <burny> given a path from x,y to x2,y2.   if you want a path from x3,y3 to x4,y4: and x3,y3 has line of sight to x,y: and x4,y4 has line of sight to x2,y2: then it's trivial to find a path from x3,y3 to x4,y4
2011-10-31T22:33:45  <roflmao> I do
2011-10-31T22:33:46  <jcdny> funny thats almost exactly what I ended up with
2011-10-31T22:33:49  <grom358> is one option
2011-10-31T22:33:54  <roflmao> yep, i do it
2011-10-31T22:34:02  <roflmao> although i have a problem where a lot of my a* computations are totally wasted
2011-10-31T22:34:07  <magiik> burny: i have waypoints set up in my code now
2011-10-31T22:34:13  <magiik> it's just so messy and feels bloated
2011-10-31T22:34:22  <burny> do it better then :P
2011-10-31T22:34:32  <ChrisH_> I also can support a goal that requires more than one ant to go there, so that is easy by just continuing the BFS without erasing the first part of the search until I've found all the needed ants (or run out of ants)
2011-10-31T22:34:35  <grom358> or with food.. just stop at first ant
2011-10-31T22:34:37  <magiik> but i'm having more problems with those "hardcoded" or saved paths
2011-10-31T22:34:50  <magiik> all the ants on the same paths - doesn't work well for bi-directional motion
2011-10-31T22:35:00  <magiik> the ants collide, and you end up pathfinding them again, or waypointing them again
2011-10-31T22:35:23  <ChrisH_> bi-directional motion is a waste of turns, and should be avoided.
2011-10-31T22:35:26  <burny> shouldn't need to use new waypoints
2011-10-31T22:35:32  <burny> unless trying to avoid an entire army
2011-10-31T22:35:52  <magiik> yeah... i agree the bi-directional motion is more of a side effect of lazy goals ( random )
2011-10-31T22:36:04  <ChrisH_> if you have two ants trying to cross paths they are going to the wrong goals because they are both closer to the other ant's goal
2011-10-31T22:36:05  <magiik> but still, it's a problem
2011-10-31T22:36:35  <ChrisH_> solve the other problem and your bi-dir motion problem goes away
2011-10-31T22:36:48  <magiik> yeah i havn't implemented any real goal logic yet, other than enemy hills
2011-10-31T22:36:53  <magiik> and it's a lot of random motion
2011-10-31T22:37:05  <grom358> yes.. so basically.. at the end I have a score assigned to each tile.. ants move to tiles with a better score
2011-10-31T22:37:13  <roflmao> so a star for food aint bad right?
2011-10-31T22:37:17  <ChrisH_> well, here is what I do to avoid ant collisions, it's pretty easy:
2011-10-31T22:37:18  <roflmao> that should be a piece of cake

2011-10-31T22:37:39  <magiik> i've found short A* on closeby food runs insanely fast

2011-10-31T22:38:04  <ChrisH_> first, figure out what move each ant should make, then loop over the orders and if the ant isn't going to step on another ant let it move, otherwise just skip it, but keep track of how many you've skipped
2011-10-31T22:38:07  <grom358> as chris was saying.. You can cap the search with whatever you got in mind.. mind you for 10 player map I was getting my BFS search map wide done in 20ms

2011-10-31T22:38:17  <magiik> it's when your heurestic goes against the "true" path that A* starts having problems
2011-10-31T22:38:23  <ChrisH_> keep looping until either all the ants have moved or you have skipped all the ants
2011-10-31T22:38:49  <ChrisH_> all the unmoved ants that is
2011-10-31T22:39:06  <grom358> problem with A* too is you have to know which target you want to path too.. so how do you decide?
2011-10-31T22:39:07  <roflmao> yeah i think the problem magiik
2011-10-31T22:39:08  <ChrisH_> reset the skip count each time you move an ant
2011-10-31T22:39:12  <roflmao> is that i don't have wrapping implemented for my a*
2011-10-31T22:39:22  <magiik> ok, so 3 ants in a line, 2 ants want to move east, 1 ant wants to move west
2011-10-31T22:39:23  <roflmao> so a "nearby" food is actually extremefuckingfaraway
2011-10-31T22:39:26  <roflmao> and since I don't have a distance limit
2011-10-31T22:40:05  <grom358> fixed your get neighbours in A* to take the wrapping into account
2011-10-31T22:40:10  <ChrisH_> grom: yeah, how do you mach ants to goals if you don't know which are closes to each other, big problem with A*
2011-10-31T22:40:26  <ChrisH_> mach=match
2011-10-31T22:40:56  <magiik> allright, enough discussion for me, time to vegge out, drink some booze, smoke a bowl, enjoy halloween

2011-10-31T22:41:04  <magiik> thanks for the ideas though guys
2011-10-31T22:41:07  <roflmao> i use manhattan
2011-10-31T22:41:13  <roflmao> i should use eucledian
2011-10-31T22:41:15  <grom358> yeah.. I was using BFS for food anyway.. I just decided yesterday going use it for everything.. and thought about all the things I can do with it this way.. still coding it all up
2011-10-31T22:41:17  <magiik> i use manhattan too - just quick and easy
2011-10-31T22:41:22  <roflmao> yeah but it doesn't use wrapping
2011-10-31T22:41:24  <grom358> but the tests so far are going well

2011-10-31T22:42:10  <magiik> it's like either practice against stupid bots, practice against your own bots ( or older versions ), or practice on a tcp server ( which seems you get matched with really good players a lot)

2011-10-31T22:59:21  <magiik> what instance type?
2011-10-31T23:00:05  *** tmandry <tmandry!~tyler@unaffiliated/tman> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
2011-10-31T23:00:36  <jcdny> c1.medium - 2 virt cores with 2.5 cpu units each
2011-10-31T23:00:57  <jcdny> I think they run 2 bots per core but I could be wrong.
2011-10-31T23:01:56  <grom358> cause locally my bot takes about 80ms per turn
2011-10-31T23:03:11  <grom358> no combat logic.. just pathfinding and collecting food etc
2011-10-31T23:05:23  <grom358> isn't more than 1 bot per core bad cause an opponents bot can be using the CPU up on u
2011-10-31T23:06:13  <burny> and you can use the cache hit/miss signature, to determine which bot you are playing against
2011-10-31T23:10:32  <jcdny> I think that's a stretch and in any case if your turn time is faster you can tell how slow the other player is....
2011-10-31T23:11:41  <jcdny> by latency on the next turn.  then maybe you can try a timeout attack by e.g. putting all your ants on the border of the map or going near the other players ants and seeing if it slows his turn time down
2011-10-31T23:12:46  <grom358> wouldn't that be against the rules but

2011-10-31T23:15:14  <yoden1> i feel like trying to timeout your enemies is probably allowed, but unlikely to work against a good bot
2011-10-31T23:15:19  <jcdny> I don't think so since you would be strictly conforming to the protocol and not trying to break your jail or anything.
2011-10-31T23:15:31  *** yoden1 is now known as yoden
2011-10-31T23:15:55  <jcdny> yeah and it especially would not work at higher levels since most people will timeslice if needed.

2011-10-31T23:19:18  <burny> I would estimat ethat only 2 of the top100 bots, will ever use more than 50% of processing

2011-10-31T23:20:30  <grom358> yeah.. depending on language
2011-10-31T23:23:39  <grom358> I want to know if anyone using neural networks etc yet
2011-10-31T23:27:04  <Antimony> I don't think neural networks will be effective here
2011-10-31T23:27:22  <Antimony> Neural networks are what you use when you have no idea how to do anything more effective
2011-10-31T23:27:25  <grom358> or genetic algorithms
2011-10-31T23:27:43  <Antimony> Basically you're saying the problem is too complex for a human to understand
2011-10-31T23:27:56  <Antimony> so you can't figure out any good algorithms
2011-10-31T23:28:43  <grom358> well.. by human to understand.. u mean for a human to describe as an algorithm. right?

2011-10-31T23:32:19  <grom358> well I was just interested in having my ant evolve by itself..
2011-10-31T23:32:21  <Antimony> my bot can bruteforce pathfind and coordinate dozens of ants in like 15ms

2011-10-31T23:48:13  <bysin> what that video doesnt show is the contrast against an intelligent human creating a competing algorithm
2011-10-31T23:48:44  <bysin> genetic algorithms are guess and check, instead of rational problem solving
2011-10-31T23:48:52  <bysin> which is why you never see a genetic algorithm win an AI contest
2011-10-31T23:49:32  <bysin> the highest i've seen was reddit's tron submittion i think, it got in 250th-ish place

2011-10-31T23:51:43  <bmh> genetic algorithms and statistical machine learning are typically the worst way to solve any problem.
2011-10-31T23:51:52  <bmh> They just work really well when there's no other solution.

2011-10-31T23:52:29  <burny> ginetic algo is good for learning, with unknown input

2011-10-31T23:53:23  <avdg> oh well, if you only care about a solution, these formulas are fine
2011-10-31T23:53:31  <avdg> :-)
2011-10-31T23:53:40  <burny> eg. learning ot walk.. travel speed, and how often you fall over are you metrics.. and each muscle has various input paramaters
