2011-04-03T00:00:18  <antimatroid> people don't need to worry about programming for such a special case and not ending the game if it would result in a lower score
2011-04-03T00:00:27  <antimatroid> or a higher score for the enemy..
2011-04-03T00:00:29  <antimatroid> potentially..
2011-04-03T00:00:50  <antimatroid> the idea is you would still want to go in for the kill
2011-04-03T00:01:20  <antimatroid> i know it's a very unlikely edge case, but it's fairly easy to say the food bonus goes to the last participating player if there is one and possibly works better? :P
2011-04-03T00:03:11  <sigh>  sure
2011-04-03T00:03:41  <sigh> hmm.. at the moment I think I've just got turnsremaining*spawnrate so it won't do anything anyway
2011-04-03T00:04:37  <antimatroid> ... you should be adding the number of food squares currently on the grid too :)
2011-04-03T00:04:40  <antimatroid> that will fix it
2011-04-03T00:05:11  <antimatroid> it would likely be a pretty small bonus unless both armies are small
2011-04-03T00:05:42  *** stocha <stocha!575a5513@gateway/web/freenode/ip.87.90.85.19> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-03T00:05:50  <sigh> both armies?
2011-04-03T00:05:52  <stocha> what memory can we expect to have ?
2011-04-03T00:06:09  <antimatroid> well, the dying army has to be small, the winning army might be small too
2011-04-03T00:06:26  <antimatroid> stocha: wont know until we work out how everything is to be run
2011-04-03T00:06:32  <antimatroid> i'm not banking on much if we do multiplayer
2011-04-03T00:07:17  <stocha> will it be more like 1kb or more like 1gb ?
2011-04-03T00:07:36  <stocha> or somewhere in between ?
2011-04-03T00:08:28  <stocha> i realize i'm trying to optimize memory. And that could be so wrong :p
2011-04-03T00:08:32  <antimatroid> i would say 200mb-1gb would be my guess
2011-04-03T00:08:41  <stocha> okay
2011-04-03T00:08:44  <antimatroid> maybe less
2011-04-03T00:08:50  <stocha> anyone think i can bet on 100 mo ?
2011-04-03T00:08:51  <sigh> 1gb per bot seems excessive
2011-04-03T00:08:55  <antimatroid> are you doing a tree already?
2011-04-03T00:09:07  <stocha> no ... but still i'm worrying :p
2011-04-03T00:09:21  <antimatroid> i'm worried about my tree, i may have to clear state information as i generate
2011-04-03T00:09:26  <stocha> i'd like to maintain some full int structure for each square   * number of entity
2011-04-03T00:09:39  <stocha> (ant food, maybe even water i don't know)
2011-04-03T00:09:45  <stocha> it is starting to add up :p
2011-04-03T00:10:12  <antimatroid> i have a fair bit of information for each square, and i have a grid of those, which each node in my tree will have
2011-04-03T00:10:22  <stocha> but i was like maybe we will have only 1mb.
2011-04-03T00:10:28  <antimatroid> i expect 100mb to be more than enough in the worst case where i clear data as i generate
2011-04-03T00:10:52  <stocha> if 100 mb is okay i'll be fine up until i do trees i guess.
2011-04-03T00:10:54  <antimatroid> you shouldn't be getting less than 100mb i don't think
2011-04-03T00:10:55  <stocha> i hope.
2011-04-03T00:11:02  <stocha> what will the max map size be ?
2011-04-03T00:11:03  <sigh> stocha: some of the language run times won't fit in 1 mb :P
2011-04-03T00:11:15  <antimatroid> stocha: will depend on what we can visualise
2011-04-03T00:11:22  <antimatroid> people are keen for as large as possible i think
2011-04-03T00:11:24  <stocha> yeah but that doesn't say much about the memory of the structures :p
2011-04-03T00:11:44  <antimatroid> maybe i should drop the grid representation
2011-04-03T00:11:52  <stocha> yeah but with my idea of using int map based on real map size (for simplicity really) i have to know a size limit :p
2011-04-03T00:12:13  <antimatroid> there will be a limit when the contest starts
2011-04-03T00:12:20  <antimatroid> or soon after
2011-04-03T00:12:23  <stocha> if it gets much larger than 128 i'll have to start worrying
2011-04-03T00:12:26  <antimatroid> until then assume anything
2011-04-03T00:12:38  <stocha> if it is larger then 512, then i have to really take it into account
2011-04-03T00:12:42  <antimatroid> i doubt we'd get over 200x200 and i personally don't think that's feasible
2011-04-03T00:13:12  <antimatroid> we need to also take into consideration the length of games, and allowing games to run long enough to actually play out
2011-04-03T00:13:13  <stocha> okay so 256x256 will be the definite limit then ?
2011-04-03T00:13:25  <antimatroid> 200x200 is hard to show and would require fairly lengthy games
2011-04-03T00:13:33  <stocha> good
2011-04-03T00:13:33  <antimatroid> stocha: i can give you no definite limit
2011-04-03T00:13:42  <stocha> have you any authority over the case ?
2011-04-03T00:13:42  <antimatroid> i am strictly giving you my current opinion on the topic
2011-04-03T00:13:46  <antimatroid> no i don't
2011-04-03T00:14:10  <stocha> had you some discussion with any authorities about it ? :p
2011-04-03T00:14:28  <antimatroid> i'm fairly confident jeff will agree with what i just said
2011-04-03T00:14:36  <stocha> Still i suppose most will agree that 200+ isn't that good :p
2011-04-03T00:15:03  <stocha> okay, so i have 100mb and 256x256 max size :p
2011-04-03T00:15:27  <antimatroid> i think you would be fairly safe taking those as worst case scenarios for the moment
2011-04-03T00:15:35  <antimatroid> you and i both will need to reevaluate a lot of things otherwise
2011-04-03T00:15:51  <stocha> mmm i need the length of game and max number of food per game :p
2011-04-03T00:16:03  <antimatroid> sigh: what's the current spawn
2011-04-03T00:16:10  <antimatroid> we can't lock a length in now
2011-04-03T00:16:15  <sigh> current spawn?
2011-04-03T00:16:19  <antimatroid> rate
2011-04-03T00:16:21  <stocha> give some max value again
2011-04-03T00:16:30  <stocha> there should be pretty safe guess.
2011-04-03T00:16:33  <sigh> 1 food per turn per player
2011-04-03T00:16:40  <stocha> no starting food ?
2011-04-03T00:16:40  <antimatroid> length will depend on what allows for a game to play out with the dimensions that are decided upon
2011-04-03T00:16:52  <sigh> there is starting food
2011-04-03T00:17:00  <antimatroid> ah yeah, i was going to say otherwise :P
2011-04-03T00:17:05  <stocha> what will be the limit for starting food ?
2011-04-03T00:17:07  <sigh> but I would not count on any of that staying the same
2011-04-03T00:17:16  <sigh> stocha: not part of the specs
2011-04-03T00:17:19  <antimatroid> sigh: there should always be starting food
2011-04-03T00:17:36  <sigh> antimatroid: sure, but the amount of starting food is not part of the specs
2011-04-03T00:17:38  <stocha> i still need a upper limit, for anticipating worst case memory usage.
2011-04-03T00:17:49  <sigh> stocha: upper limit is all land
2011-04-03T00:17:58  <stocha> 65535 !
2011-04-03T00:18:00  <antimatroid> all food*
2011-04-03T00:18:05  <stocha> that's a lot of ant to care for !
2011-04-03T00:18:14  <sigh> *all land is food :P
2011-04-03T00:18:20  <antimatroid> we wont flood the maps, but you are asking for an upper bound
2011-04-03T00:18:21  <stocha> but then the food per turn would drop i guess :p
2011-04-03T00:18:22  <sigh> stocha: you asked for an upper limit
2011-04-03T00:18:22  <antimatroid> that is one
2011-04-03T00:18:30  <sigh> point is that it is not defined
2011-04-03T00:18:34  <stocha> that's hell of a upper one :p
2011-04-03T00:18:49  <sigh> and it won't ever be part of the specs
2011-04-03T00:19:00  <stocha> so i have to account for 65000 ant
2011-04-03T00:19:14  <stocha> when i would like to go for like max 2048 :p
2011-04-03T00:19:26  <antimatroid> you can unofficially bank on the maps not being completely flooded as that would be stupid
2011-04-03T00:19:32  <sigh> stocha: no, you don't... up to you to decide what you account for
2011-04-03T00:19:42  <antimatroid> we're just not willing to give a realistic upper bound, that's the point
2011-04-03T00:19:43  <stocha> :'(
2011-04-03T00:19:58  <sigh> but you can't rely on there being a fixed answer
2011-04-03T00:20:27  <stocha> how are people to make bots if they have no informations on anything :p
2011-04-03T00:20:40  <sigh> stocha: use intelligence :P
2011-04-03T00:20:43  <stocha> the most lucky one will win. because his bot won't crash.
2011-04-03T00:20:44  <antimatroid> sigh: might be worth playing around with n in {1,2,3} food squares per player each turn
2011-04-03T00:20:47  <sigh> that's what it is called AI
2011-04-03T00:21:06  <stocha> it's not ai, it's memory management guessing.
2011-04-03T00:21:25  <antimatroid> it wont be that absurd so as to break lots of bots
2011-04-03T00:21:30  <sigh> stocha: well then wait until the contest has started and the engine is stable
2011-04-03T00:21:36  <antimatroid> just don't restrict yourself to a really small number of ants per team
2011-04-03T00:21:43  <stocha> ah you will provide information then ? :)
2011-04-03T00:21:56  <antimatroid> the engine code will be open source
2011-04-03T00:21:57  <stocha> i was started to worry that no upper bound was the spec.
2011-04-03T00:22:02  <sigh> stocha: the engine source code is always available
2011-04-03T00:22:11  <stocha> it won't change during the ongoing contest ?
2011-04-03T00:22:26  <sigh> it won't change in the finals
2011-04-03T00:22:28  <antimatroid> we're hoping to lock things down like that earlier rather than later
2011-04-03T00:22:36  <antimatroid> but no absolute guarantee
2011-04-03T00:22:48  <sigh> the only reason it will change is for bugs or to balance the game
2011-04-03T00:22:53  <sigh> before the finals
2011-04-03T00:22:59  <stocha> i still have trouble understanding how decision are made :p
2011-04-03T00:23:22  <antimatroid> decisions are made to try and make the most interesting game both visually and strategically and to allow people to get involved easily
2011-04-03T00:23:24  <sigh> stocha: ok, ask again after the submissions are open
2011-04-03T00:23:28  <antimatroid> at least those are my main prioirites
2011-04-03T00:23:29  <sigh> that's the answer
2011-04-03T00:23:33  <sigh> it's pointless asking now
2011-04-03T00:24:00  <antimatroid> we don't even have an official battle resolution and you want the definite upper bound on maximum starting food squares? :P
2011-04-03T00:24:04  <stocha> yeah i accept the answer of 1 food per ground square.
2011-04-03T00:24:34  <stocha> but now i ask this new question about my wondering how decision are settled. Not why (to make the game more interesting) but How.
2011-04-03T00:24:58  <antimatroid> jeff started this, he has the ruling opinion
2011-04-03T00:25:22  <stocha> So decision are made, whenever jeff state that something should be ?
2011-04-03T00:25:22  <antimatroid> he is at least willing to listen to peoples opinions and while not necessarily always agreeing with me has a somewhat valid reason for his opinion
2011-04-03T00:25:26  <antimatroid> so it could be worse
2011-04-03T00:25:52  <stocha> hey i just want to know the rules. I guess now i have to try to know jeff :p
2011-04-03T00:26:04  <stocha> Will he be making a bot also ?
2011-04-03T00:26:21  <antimatroid> it has been said over and over again, the rules are not decided and anyone playing around atm should not expect them to be
2011-04-03T00:26:29  <stocha> what langage is he comfortagle with ?
2011-04-03T00:26:34  <antimatroid> he is not allowed to compete, he has server access
2011-04-03T00:26:52  <sigh> stocha: anyone who has access to the contest servers can't compete
2011-04-03T00:26:55  <stocha> so you guys antimatroid, mcleopold ans such won't have ?
2011-04-03T00:27:05  <antimatroid> no
2011-04-03T00:27:26  <stocha> but will he still make some bots ?
2011-04-03T00:27:32  <stocha> even if he doesn't compete ?
2011-04-03T00:27:34  <antimatroid> no, he is quite busy
2011-04-03T00:27:47  <antimatroid> it wouldn't be as fun when you can't submit it to the final contest
2011-04-03T00:28:01  <stocha> so he will rely on his lieutenants big time :p
2011-04-03T00:28:01  <antimatroid> you will have a few thousand other people making bots, i wouldn't sweat it
2011-04-03T00:28:27  <stocha> do you guys have been knowing him for long ?
2011-04-03T00:29:02  <stocha> that's assuming the challenge will encounter success :p
2011-04-03T00:29:16  <stocha> wich probably every people here at the moment hope for.
2011-04-03T00:30:08  <stocha> mm, okay that's only about 4 gb of memory for the basic structures.
2011-04-03T00:30:34  <stocha> so i'm stuck with a dice roll i guess :p
2011-04-03T00:30:56  <stocha> let's try with ant <= 2048 then
2011-04-03T00:31:59  <stocha> that would give about 140 mb.
2011-04-03T00:34:31  <sigh> antimatroid: regarding food bonus, why won't it result in a stalemate when there are more than 2 players?
2011-04-03T00:34:42  <antimatroid> sigh: i thought of that
2011-04-03T00:34:44  <antimatroid> what then?
2011-04-03T00:35:19  <sigh> hmm?
2011-04-03T00:35:20  <antimatroid> i think really in both situations you both want to be in a fight if possible anyway, to score some points
2011-04-03T00:35:31  <antimatroid> maybe without the food bonus in both instances?
2011-04-03T00:35:36  <stocha> why add a food bonus then ?
2011-04-03T00:35:42  <sigh> both situations?
2011-04-03T00:35:58  <antimatroid> ie. maybe the food bonus shouldn't be given out at the end ever, 2 players or n players
2011-04-03T00:36:52  <antimatroid> that way we can just have: if the game ends before the maximum number of turns, the winner gets a food bonus which is equal to the remaining number of turns * spawn rate
2011-04-03T00:37:28  <sigh> ok, why won't that result in a stalemate?
2011-04-03T00:37:47  <stocha> you give +1 if it does ?
2011-04-03T00:37:56  <antimatroid> if you can get an ant involved in killing another your points increase
2011-04-03T00:37:57  <stocha> to the remaining guy
2011-04-03T00:38:22  <antimatroid> you may not want to fight if you think you are really close on points and not sure who would win
2011-04-03T00:38:27  <stocha> so the game is about having ant involved in killing one.
2011-04-03T00:38:29  <antimatroid> but i think that's the same with the food bonus?
2011-04-03T00:38:48  <antimatroid> really you're going to want to try and score any additonal points
2011-04-03T00:39:01  <stocha> why ? if you are already winning
2011-04-03T00:39:06  <sigh> so you are arguing that the food bonus is too small to matter?
2011-04-03T00:39:08  <antimatroid> you don't know that
2011-04-03T00:39:10  <stocha> you only have to wait for the game to end.
2011-04-03T00:39:14  <stocha> ah true.
2011-04-03T00:39:18  <stocha> but you can guess
2011-04-03T00:39:20  <antimatroid> sigh: yeah pretty much
2011-04-03T00:39:28  <sigh> then why have it? :P
2011-04-03T00:39:30  <stocha> if you can guess how many ant there is in in the game.
2011-04-03T00:39:36  <antimatroid> sigh: and that the food bonus is meant to encourage you to end the game earlier
2011-04-03T00:39:39  <antimatroid> the game is over regardless
2011-04-03T00:39:57  <sigh> if it is too small to matter, why would it encourage the game to end?
2011-04-03T00:40:04  <antimatroid> defining the food bonus as above, winning there gives you a food bonus, but it's 0
2011-04-03T00:40:04  <stocha> so the question is : without food bonus will the game take longer.
2011-04-03T00:40:22  <antimatroid> sigh: we're talking about the turn right as we hit max turns
2011-04-03T00:40:28  <antimatroid> the game is called off anyway
2011-04-03T00:40:38  <sigh> stop making that stupid distinction
2011-04-03T00:40:47  <antimatroid> ?
2011-04-03T00:40:47  <stocha> why not state that if the game end before turn limit the remaining player always win ?
2011-04-03T00:40:54  <sigh> there is no difference between a game that ends early and otherwise
2011-04-03T00:41:05  <sigh> nor should there be
2011-04-03T00:41:11  <sigh> it just complicates the discussion
2011-04-03T00:41:26  <antimatroid> my point above was there doesn't need to be
2011-04-03T00:41:52  <antimatroid> all you need to say is: if the game ends and there is one participating player remaining, they get a food bonus which is the number of turns remaining * spawn rate
2011-04-03T00:42:17  <antimatroid> if num turns = 0, the food bonus is nothing
2011-04-03T00:42:35  <sigh> yes, there has never been an argument about that?
2011-04-03T00:42:35  *** amstan_ <amstan_!~amstan@76-10-134-25.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-03T00:42:35  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan_
2011-04-03T00:43:07  <sigh> I don't see why you ever made that distinction
2011-04-03T00:43:19  <antimatroid> i started this conversation talking about the food bonus as that specific point :\
2011-04-03T00:43:45  <sigh> what specific point?
2011-04-03T00:43:52  <stocha> end of turn limit
2011-04-03T00:45:08  <sigh> why does that case matter, or why did that case ever matter as a distinct case?
2011-04-03T00:45:10  <stocha> won't scoring dead ants increase the incentive for defending positions ?
2011-04-03T00:45:45  <antimatroid> sigh: my original point was wanting to avoid a stalemate there with the current metho
2011-04-03T00:45:54  <stocha> because attacking my earn a lower ratio
2011-04-03T00:45:55  <antimatroid> then i thought we came around to the conclusion that i was wrong
2011-04-03T00:46:00  <sigh> antimatroid: I thought food bonus was always: "turns remaining * spawn rate" or "turns remaining * spawn rate + current food"
2011-04-03T00:46:43  <antimatroid> sigh: i wasn't aware that the end case had been considered, i'm sure mcleopold and i have talked about it before
2011-04-03T00:46:55  <antimatroid> probably more me querying him on it like this though
2011-04-03T00:47:00  <sigh> the end case should never have to be considered!
2011-04-03T00:47:15  <sigh> it should follow as a trivial extension of the general case
2011-04-03T00:47:30  <stocha> what make you think that the food bonus will change how people tune their bots.
2011-04-03T00:47:38  <sigh> I'm confused as to why there was ever a distinction!
2011-04-03T00:48:12  <stocha> if couting killed ant is fair. Then what use for a food bonus ?

2011-04-03T00:54:25  <sigh> meh, I have a feeling we've been talking past each other... I guess I don't understand the terminology you guys have been using
2011-04-03T01:33:51  <antimatroid> sigh: i agree with that
2011-04-03T01:34:02  <sigh> :)
2011-04-03T01:34:44  <sigh> antimatroid: ok, to clarify the next point, the current consideration is between: "turns remaining * spawn rate" and "turns remaining * spawn rate + current food"?
2011-04-03T01:35:13  <antimatroid> i don't mind :P
2011-04-03T01:35:31  <sigh> what's the current consensus?
2011-04-03T01:35:50  <antimatroid> it was with + current food
2011-04-03T01:35:56  <antimatroid> but i don't think it's really been discussed
2011-04-03T01:36:13  <sigh> i see
2011-04-03T01:36:48  <sigh> and what change were you proposing to avoid stalemate?
2011-04-03T01:37:47  <antimatroid> i wasn't sure whether the food bonus was defined at the end of the game like that
2011-04-03T01:38:27  <antimatroid> it is the obvious way to do it, you're right, but there's a lot of things that i think are obvious that apparently aren't
2011-04-03T01:38:33  <antimatroid> like using row/col for indexing :P
2011-04-03T01:38:36  <sigh> :P
2011-04-03T01:39:34  <sigh> either way, I'm unsure how clarifying the case where there is exactly 1 player at the turn limit helps... that is such a rare edge case?
2011-04-03T01:40:35  <sigh> I guess my question is, were you brining it up for completeness sake, or because it would change the outcome fundementally?
2011-04-03T01:48:06  <antimatroid> completeness
2011-04-03T01:48:14  <antimatroid> i always bring up stupid edge cases like that :P
2011-04-03T01:48:27  <antimatroid> i get ripped to pieces at uni if i don't check edge cases
2011-04-03T01:49:39  <sigh> :P
2011-04-03T01:53:18  <sigh> well, then I guess this is what I'm confused about. If you wanted to give an upper bound on what score could have been achieved by keeping the enemy alive then that would be "turns remaining * spawn rate + current food"... however this seems like such a large bonus that it would encourage stalemates
2011-04-03T01:53:52  <sigh> so your argument was that it would not be such a large bonus?
2011-04-03T01:55:36  <antimatroid> i was just trying to make sure people didn't get to some weird edge case and want to not fight just because the game was about to end
2011-04-03T01:55:44  <antimatroid> like what we had with planet wars
2011-04-03T01:55:59  <antimatroid> i won quite a few games in the final contest just because i knew to stop taking neutrals from the max turns
2011-04-03T01:56:12  <antimatroid> like it actually happened more than once for me
2011-04-03T01:56:22  <antimatroid> which is quite a few for such a seemingly small edge case
2011-04-03T01:57:44  <antimatroid> ideally i would like max turns to be there just because it needs to be, and not really change the strategy people use as they approach it
2011-04-03T01:58:20  <sigh> I'm not talking about the edge case anymore... I thought we agreed that would be handled in the obvious way :(
2011-04-03T01:58:24  <antimatroid> alas that isn't the case with scoring, as if there's lots of players left, people are going to start killing like mad
2011-04-03T01:58:47  <antimatroid> oh, hmmm sorry :P hang on
2011-04-03T01:59:18  <antimatroid> i had no argument on that, but i do think it was too large before
2011-04-03T01:59:26  <antimatroid> i don't mind not including current food
2011-04-03T01:59:54  <antimatroid> you also need to remember that this player doesn't really know if they're competing with the last remaining bot or another bot for positions
2011-04-03T02:00:14  <antimatroid> so i think they will go for the food bonus if they have a half decent chance
2011-04-03T02:00:30  <sigh> hmmm... are you sure?
2011-04-03T02:01:21  <antimatroid> i don't think the last two remaining bots will necessarily be the top 2 ranking bots
2011-04-03T02:01:34  <antimatroid> the scoring is based around how much you have participated in the actual battles
2011-04-03T02:01:53  <sigh> well, the food bonus upsets that :p
2011-04-03T02:01:56  <antimatroid> i think a half decent "try to survive bot" might make it to the end of quite a few games
2011-04-03T02:02:06  <antimatroid> yes, but that's just another part of the game
2011-04-03T02:02:21  <sigh> I thought you didn't want that
2011-04-03T02:02:32  <sigh> as that leads to stalemates
2011-04-03T02:02:32  <antimatroid> maybe it should be you get a point for every ant you spawn?
2011-04-03T02:02:47  <antimatroid> or you get a point for every ant every turn
2011-04-03T02:02:59  <antimatroid> i don't want that
2011-04-03T02:03:03  <sigh> I thought about that
2011-04-03T02:03:10  <antimatroid> my point is that bot wouldn't win, so it's not a good strategy
2011-04-03T02:03:23  <antimatroid> but if a person makes such a bot, then it may make it to such a situation without winning
2011-04-03T02:03:36  <antimatroid> and with thousands of bots, there's bound to be plenty of variation
2011-04-03T02:04:03  <sigh> but food bonus makes a "try to survive bot" strategy valid?
2011-04-03T02:04:08  <sigh> does it not?
2011-04-03T02:04:15  <antimatroid> it makes it more valid with the scoring system
2011-04-03T02:04:24  <antimatroid> where's stocha when i need him
2011-04-03T02:04:33  <antimatroid> i wouldn't mind having him try out those two other scoring methods above
2011-04-03T02:04:59  <sigh> two other? how many scoring systems are there?
2011-04-03T02:05:05  <antimatroid> there is the current one
2011-04-03T02:05:23  <sigh> current is ""turns remaining * spawn rate"?
2011-04-03T02:05:23  <antimatroid> then there is 1. you get an point for every ant spawned, 2. you get a point for every live ant every turn
2011-04-03T02:05:32  <sigh> ah ok
2011-04-03T02:05:56  <antimatroid> i kind of like 2
2011-04-03T02:06:08  <antimatroid> although it may discourage fighting
2011-04-03T02:06:33  <antimatroid> 1. might be better, as you fight for territory to spawn more ants
2011-04-03T02:06:37  <sigh> 2 exacerbates the problem, you get a HUGE bonus for being the last alive
2011-04-03T02:07:08  <janzert> just since it hasn't even been mentioned lately, I still prefer inverse order of elimination. ;)
2011-04-03T02:07:09  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't like 2 30 seconds later
2011-04-03T02:07:26  <antimatroid> janzert: that is simple
2011-04-03T02:07:47  <antimatroid> actually, that way scoring doesn't determine what works best out of those various strategies
2011-04-03T02:07:57  <sigh> (1) is similar to food bonus
2011-04-03T02:07:57  <antimatroid> what gets you surviving the longest does
2011-04-03T02:08:09  <antimatroid> whether that's camping, expanding, being catious, being fierce etc.
2011-04-03T02:08:15  * janzert nods
2011-04-03T02:08:25  * janzert goes away again
2011-04-03T02:08:35  <antimatroid> sigh: what do you think about that?
2011-04-03T02:08:40  <antimatroid> it's dead simple to explain too
2011-04-03T02:09:25  <sigh> I agree with with what's been said... it is very appealing and the danger is that it leads to a stalemate
2011-04-03T02:09:45  <antimatroid> yeah i was just running back to my computer to say that :)
2011-04-03T02:10:06  <antimatroid> but if you don't fight and others expand, then you will be too small to compete
2011-04-03T02:10:13  <antimatroid> with the fog of war it's hard to tell
2011-04-03T02:10:36  <sigh> last alive wins, with the rest sorted by score might be a better compromise
2011-04-03T02:10:49  <antimatroid> i don't think stale mates will be too much of an issue except with small openings where neither play can see an opportunity to do anything without getting pwned
2011-04-03T02:12:35  <sigh> i think I prefer scoring the losers based on score so that you can't just get 2nd place by camping

2011-04-03T02:37:13  <sigh> what's that?
2011-04-03T02:37:13  <antimatroid> depending on the map, it's going to have a different level of importance
2011-04-03T02:37:18  <sigh> of course
2011-04-03T02:37:50  <sigh> and depends on length of the game
2011-04-03T02:38:10  <antimatroid> although we really need to get some decisions made and get the tournament going

2011-04-03T04:47:39  <Frontier> someone proposed to have a list of replays available on the net in form of a json array. it would be generated by a parametrized php. from the last contest we can see that there is interest in downloading all replays that match certain criteria, even if it is only your own games.
2011-04-03T04:48:21  <phire> sounds like a good idea
2011-04-03T04:48:25  <Frontier> Maybe it has been discussed here already.
2011-04-03T04:50:54  <Frontier> I would be interested in the list of games in which a certain bot that is stronger than mine lost, so I can try to figure out a good strategy against it. And (I posted that on gihub already) a 'continue from' parameter, so you never load the complete list just to get a refresh on the last couple of new games.
2011-04-03T04:51:38  <Frontier> A list of all games played by a Ruby bot or a Python bot seems rather pointless to me though.
2011-04-03T04:53:01  <phire> but a list of all games played on certain map types would be.
2011-04-03T04:53:51  <Frontier> you mean a complete list off all games played on symmetrical maps for example?
2011-04-03T04:55:04  <phire> more percisce, like all maps that have narrow gates between player locations
2011-04-03T04:56:03  <Frontier> phire: You are asking for quite some backend support here :)
2011-04-03T04:56:53  <phire> well, I'm pointing out that a large backend might be needed to provide useful information
2011-04-03T05:00:20  <Frontier> I think it is a very special case you think about. This is more something the players should do themselves then. But some filtering on the server should be in place anayway to avoid high loads.
2011-04-03T05:01:35  <Frontier> One step is to only provide links in the list of games. Links to the map and the replay as separate entities. This way you can skip replays where the map doesn't match your own criteria
2011-04-03T05:01:52  <phire> yes
2011-04-03T05:10:10  <Frontier> Ok, I'll now implement the fullscreen mode in the visualizer correctly (Java standalone version). Unfortunately to get rid of the window decorations you have to let Java free the associated system resources in a separate thread first. That is a bit annoying when you need this to happen instantly. So the best way seems to be to create a new window and move the contents from the normal window into the fullscreen window.

2011-04-03T05:21:24  <sigh> that's a set, isn't it?
2011-04-03T05:23:26  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-03T05:23:28  <phire> Sets are guaranteed to perform operations of insertion, deletion, and testing whether an element is in it, in logarithmic time - O(log n).
2011-04-03T05:23:32  <antimatroid> but i can do it with a map too yes?
2011-04-03T05:24:34  <sigh> antimatroid: of course, but why would you use a map unless you actually had values associated with each item?

2011-04-03T06:06:09  <sigh> have two files, one that answers "how do I run the bot", and another for "how do I improve the bot"
2011-04-03T06:07:00  <antimatroid> getting_started.txt and getting_better.txt? :P
2011-04-03T06:08:22  <sigh> "how do I run the bot" should definely be the readme
2011-04-03T06:08:26  <sigh> *README
2011-04-03T06:08:29  <antimatroid> yeah true
2011-04-03T06:08:34  <antimatroid> i'll put that stuff in there
2011-04-03T06:08:42  <antimatroid> anyway gotta take my brother to the airport, back after
2011-04-03T06:08:48  <sigh> cya
2011-04-03T06:16:27  <Frontier> sigh: I'll implement the json replay today or tomorrow, but remain compatible with what we currently have. If someone hates it, which i doubt, I don't have to rewrite the parser.
2011-04-03T06:16:38  <sigh> :)
2011-04-03T06:18:29  <sigh> Frontier: also if you haven't already, please look at how visualize_locally.py works in the replay branch and tell me if you think that it is fine
2011-04-03T06:19:27  <sigh> and that offline.html temaplte is alright
2011-04-03T06:19:41  <Frontier> is it spelled wether or weather? (the synonym to if)
2011-04-03T06:20:06  <sigh> whether :P
2011-04-03T06:21:37  <Frontier> oh thanks ^^. I guess I only have to look at the html template then?
2011-04-03T06:22:01  <sigh> yeah, just have a look at it and feel free to change it
2011-04-03T06:22:25  <sigh> if you think something else would be more appropriate :)
2011-04-03T06:22:26  <Frontier> I can add a section to the ant build.xml to zip it up, but I don't know where amstan wants to put downlods
2011-04-03T06:22:57  <sigh> yeah, I don't know how everything is going to be distributed
2011-04-03T06:23:45  <Frontier> ok, you kept the load button and text field
2011-04-03T06:24:10  <sigh> I made minimal changes to make it work :P
2011-04-03T06:25:55  <Frontier> Ok, sure. Do you think it is ok, to remove the manual copy&paste option to have the replay in the center?
2011-04-03T06:26:26  <sigh> I automatically put them into fullscreen mode
2011-04-03T06:26:34  <sigh> if you look at the onload line
2011-04-03T06:26:48  <Frontier> :)
2011-04-03T06:27:24  <Frontier> hacker, that was supposed to be a private method :p
2011-04-03T06:27:29  <sigh> :D
2011-04-03T06:27:47  <sigh> then you should have made it private :P
2011-04-03T06:28:48  <Frontier> It wont work on IE now that I put the whole JavaScript into the applet. Should IE be supported as well?
2011-04-03T06:29:40  <sigh> is it easy?
2011-04-03T06:30:57  <Frontier> It requires a browser detection and of course the applet in the distribution (which is equal to distributing the offline java visualizer with some html template and a python script ^^)
2011-04-03T06:31:24  <sigh> don't you have to do that anyway for the online visualiser?
2011-04-03T06:32:12  <Frontier> Sure, but imagine you download both the java and html visualizers, just to find the html version includes the java version.
2011-04-03T06:32:46  <Frontier> Maybe we should just make it clear that IE is not supported by the html only version
2011-04-03T06:32:49  <sigh> ah... then tell IE users to use the java visualiser directly
2011-04-03T06:34:14  <Frontier> Ok. I really like how Rhino enabled me to reuse the JavaScript code three times :-)
2011-04-03T06:34:56  <sigh> :)
2011-04-03T06:35:27  <sigh> can the java visualiser take input on stdin?
2011-04-03T06:35:37  <sigh> like can we pipe the engine output to the visualiser?
2011-04-03T06:35:54  <Frontier> not yet
2011-04-03T06:37:01  <Frontier> and people will also hate the load time atm. stocha wanted to look into a simple pipe-able visualizer for the streaming format
2011-04-03T06:37:35  <sigh> I was starting to write a simple ascii one using curses :P
2011-04-03T06:37:48  <Frontier> since i have no support for that format nor stdin support or the infrastructure to incrementally load replays that seemed like a good idea
2011-04-03T06:37:48  <sigh> but screen is too small to be any good :(
2011-04-03T06:38:27  <Frontier> yeah 200x200 looks horrible on a 80x40 display
2011-04-03T06:40:08  <sigh> :)

2011-04-03T06:59:26  <phreeza> ?
2011-04-03T07:03:59  <Frontier> just eclipse
2011-04-03T07:04:57  <Frontier> I think it may be some hotkey I'm accidently hitting when I add JavaDoc through Alt+Shift+J
2011-04-03T07:10:24  <phreeza> ah ok. don't know a lot about eclipse, sorry...
2011-04-03T07:41:33  <antimatroid> are we still going with starter packages standing alone from the engine/visualiser/tools this time?
2011-04-03T08:08:36  <antimatroid> i have my third "improvement idea" if i can explain in simple enough terms painting outwards from an ant until finding something attractive then moving towards that
2011-04-03T08:11:24  <sigh> antimatroid: simpler to iterate over all interesting objects and pick the closest
2011-04-03T08:12:07  <antimatroid> sigh: that's my second improvement idea
2011-04-03T08:12:12  <antimatroid> but it ignores water blocking
2011-04-03T08:12:40  <sigh> ah ok
2011-04-03T08:13:04  <sigh> then sure... but don't call it painting, just call it breadth-first search
2011-04-03T08:13:19  <sigh> they'll actually be able to look it up on google that way :P
2011-04-03T08:13:35  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-04-03T08:13:36  <antimatroid> good point
2011-04-03T08:26:30  <antimatroid> sigh: http://pastebin.com/8xJBkXaY how about that? :P
2011-04-03T08:27:48  <sigh> cool
2011-04-03T08:28:12  <sigh> maybe it should be made language agnostic and put on the wiki?
2011-04-03T08:28:43  <sigh> and link breadth-first search to the wikipedia page or some other introduction
2011-04-03T08:29:19  <antimatroid> yeah, i was just thinking it's fairly easy to make that language agnostic
2011-04-03T08:29:20  <sigh> there's really only one thing in there that is c++ specific :P
2011-04-03T08:29:28  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-03T08:29:49  <sigh> then in the README you can link to the wiki page for the tutorial
2011-04-03T08:29:49  <antimatroid> then i have a pretty good idea of how to do the more advanced strategy guide
2011-04-03T08:30:05  <antimatroid> okay, i'll start making those now
2011-04-03T08:30:12  <sigh> advanced strategy guide should be completely language agnostic
2011-04-03T08:30:25  <antimatroid> yeah that was always going to be langauge agnostic
2011-04-03T08:38:09  <antimatroid> sigh: Ants Strategy Guide and Ants Advanced Strategy Guide?
2011-04-03T08:38:33  <sigh> Tutorial + Strategy Guide
2011-04-03T08:39:08  <sigh> I don't think the second one will be very advanced :P
2011-04-03T08:48:30  <antimatroid> it will lead people towards it, but sure :p
2011-04-03T08:50:25  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Tutorial
2011-04-03T08:54:09  <Frontier> oh btw sigh: McLeopold said it is up to you to output whatever meta data in the engine.
2011-04-03T08:54:34  <sigh> Frontier: yeah, he told me that too
2011-04-03T08:54:38  <sigh> antimatroid: looks good
2011-04-03T08:55:29  <sigh> antimatroid: my understanding is that all the starter packs have a similar interface? in which case you should be able to reference sepecific functions and such
2011-04-03T08:55:34  <sigh> just guessing
2011-04-03T08:55:52  <antimatroid> sigh: I haven't looked at any other starter packages :P
2011-04-03T08:55:57  <sigh> :)
2011-04-03T08:56:05  <antimatroid> i just wrote mine early and told others to base it off mine, so hopefully :P
2011-04-03T09:09:04  <antimatroid> sigh: have you ever played with B*?
2011-04-03T09:09:12  <sigh> antimatroid: nope
2011-04-03T09:09:33  <antimatroid> a quick skim of the wiki page has it saying it works will possibly numerous objective locations and for 2 player zero sum games
2011-04-03T09:09:43  <antimatroid> with*
2011-04-03T09:11:16  <sigh> might be interesting
2011-04-03T09:13:21  <antimatroid> i can't really find anything on it :s
2011-04-03T09:13:32  <antimatroid> the wiki page looks promising though
2011-04-03T09:14:33  <sigh> my AI book seems to only mentions it in passing
2011-04-03T09:16:21  <sigh> it mentions the 2 player analogue to A* is SSS*: http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/SSS*+and+Dual*
2011-04-03T09:17:24  <sigh> but it says it is impractical :P

2011-04-03T09:30:08  <phire> from what I've read SSS* is impractical on a 8x8 chess board, where you only make one move per turn

2011-04-03T15:16:41  <Frontier> amstan: I accidently pushed to master when I was on windows. Don't know how that happened.
2011-04-03T15:18:22  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2011-04-03T15:18:33  <Frontier> I pulled master on Linux then and it listed only visualizer files, so I pushed that to epsilon again.
2011-04-03T15:19:00  <amstan> Frontier: ok, cool
2011-04-03T15:19:29  <Frontier> amstan: your comment on the json feed... have you read the other comments?
2011-04-03T15:19:37  <amstan> Frontier: you can delete remote branches with git push origin :branchthatyouwanttodelete
2011-04-03T15:19:44  <amstan> Frontier: yes
2011-04-03T15:20:08  <Frontier> so I created a new branch called master?
2011-04-03T15:20:43  <amstan> Frontier: i'm not sure... how did you pull master?
2011-04-03T15:21:10  <Frontier> in that case I blame git gui for listing master as the only option.
2011-04-03T15:21:33  <amstan> ok.. w/e
2011-04-03T15:21:45  <amstan> so.. you don't actually need a master branch
2011-04-03T15:21:54  <Frontier> no
2011-04-03T15:23:08  <amstan> Frontier: k.. so what about the json
2011-04-03T15:23:20  <Frontier> what did you mean by requesting the game info without getting the replay data? It sounds pretty much like what I proposed.
2011-04-03T15:24:05  <amstan> oh, ic
2011-04-03T15:24:24  <amstan> so.. you're proposing to always have an external link for the other stuff
2011-04-03T15:25:23  <Frontier> on this feed yes. it allows us to filter the results on the client if the serverside filtering is not enough.
2011-04-03T15:25:45  <Frontier> and then fetch only the desired replays.
2011-04-03T15:25:50  <amstan> i was just thinking something easier... keep it like it was before(with the data embedded in a string).. but for the php script that outputs that json, give it a $GET variable to keep the replay data out of the response
2011-04-03T15:26:16  <amstan> oh wait.. you're talking about lists
2011-04-03T15:26:29  <amstan> ok... sounds good either way
2011-04-03T15:26:47  * amstan gets out of this... ignore everything i said
2011-04-03T15:28:21  <amstan> McLeopold: how are you doing?

2011-04-03T19:22:04  <sigh> it stops the parent finishing before the child is actually dead, (which caused annoying errors to be displayed)
2011-04-03T19:22:13  <sigh> it doesn't hurt performance as far as I can see
2011-04-03T19:23:08  <McLeopold> the python docs suggest using communicate, as the wait may cause a deadlock
2011-04-03T19:24:56  <sigh> it can deadlock even after a SIGKILL?
2011-04-03T19:25:07  <McLeopold> that I don't know about
2011-04-03T19:25:21  <McLeopold> I haven't worked much with subprocess
2011-04-03T19:27:34  <sigh> hmm... anyone here know about python subprocess modules? :P
2011-04-03T19:28:20  <amstan> sigh: try #python
2011-04-03T19:29:29  <sigh> yeah, I'll try that a bit later

2011-04-03T23:37:41  <antimatroid> amstan: have you guys considered getting the ai challenge in gsoc?
2011-04-03T23:37:57  <amstan> antimatroid: i was thinking about it a few weeks ago
2011-04-03T23:38:06  <amstan> who would mentor?
2011-04-03T23:38:16  <antimatroid> yeah i know, that's the biggest snag
2011-04-03T23:38:25  <amstan> also.. are we that organized?

2011-04-03T23:38:47  <jbroman> GSoC is really intended for much larger (and more mature) projects.

2011-04-03T23:39:13  <antimatroid> jbroman: i'm hoping the project will mature with zeta

2011-04-03T23:40:03  <jbroman> amstan: No, I haven't done GSoC.
2011-04-03T23:40:23  <jbroman> Wasn't eligible last year, and this year I have school in the spring.
2011-04-03T23:40:53  <amstan> jbroman: i guess you can't do it next year either, since you're with google eh?
2011-04-03T23:41:06  <jbroman> amstan: Sure, let's go with that.
2011-04-03T23:41:13  <jbroman> :P

2011-04-03T23:42:46  <antimatroid> i'm going through the steps for applying atm, but i'm not sure if they'll like the fact that i'll have classes during some of it
2011-04-03T23:42:57  <amstan> antimatroid: what project?
2011-04-03T23:43:02  <antimatroid> i have a fairly relaxed courseload though, and can do my thesis based off the project
2011-04-03T23:43:13  <antimatroid> amstan: Gambit
2011-04-03T23:43:35  <antimatroid> more specifically, to iterate all nash equilibria for 2 player extensive form games with imperfect information using the sequence form :P
2011-04-03T23:43:52  <amstan> i tried investigating kate, but after chatting on irc and sending 2 emails on their mailing list with no reply i'm rather dissapointed
2011-04-03T23:44:03  <antimatroid> that's rather poor
2011-04-03T23:44:14  <antimatroid> i've received two emails from the gambit guys for the one i sent
2011-04-03T23:44:24  <amstan> i guess it depends on the org
2011-04-03T23:44:43  <amstan> and yeah, it seems to be a much bigger deal than i tought
2011-04-03T23:44:59  <amstan> they don't want you to do school or any other commitment(read: ai challenge)
2011-04-03T23:45:17  <amstan> apparently the work for gsoc is supposed to take 40hours/week
2011-04-03T23:45:20  <antimatroid> i didn't even know gambit was participating til some guy i was talking to on reddit a while ago about game theory emailed me about it
2011-04-03T23:45:32  <antimatroid> yeah, you're meant to treat it like a full time job
