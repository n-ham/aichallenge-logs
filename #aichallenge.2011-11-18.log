2011-11-18T04:38:11  <janzert> my comment earlier was looking for someone that could tell me if they could see their game error messages in a game

2011-11-18T04:38:46  <BenJackson> ohh
2011-11-18T04:39:19  <BenJackson> I thought you had a suspicion that unexpected timeouts were due to the bot filling up the stderr pipe and then blocking
2011-11-18T04:39:38  <janzert> nope :)

2011-11-18T04:56:54  <Minthos> I think timeouts are due to cpu scheduling
2011-11-18T04:57:18  <Minthos> I get them locally when I run 8 bots on a quad core with aggressive turn times
2011-11-18T04:57:37  <Minthos> but when some of the bots time out, the rest survive for the rest of the round
2011-11-18T04:57:54  <digger3> so, check the runtime of your bot regularly and abort when close to the turntime -> fixed
2011-11-18T04:58:09  <Minthos> I do that digger
2011-11-18T04:58:16  <Minthos> but sometimes it's just not enough

2011-11-18T05:14:23  <Minthos> I don't know what hardware the workers run on or if they're virtualized, but locally I need to set turn time somewhere between 150 and 200 ms to get my bots to behave like they do on the official server
2011-11-18T05:14:27  <Garf> it would require the porcess not to be running, yet require the accurate clock
2011-11-18T05:14:56  <Garf> the workers are older xeons, running vritualized

2011-11-18T09:15:47  <antimatroid> bah, what are people doing about storing paths to collect food etc. and the random tie break with spawning ants?
2011-11-18T09:15:55  <antimatroid> it makes things ridiculously complicated
2011-11-18T09:16:39  <mcstar> what??
2011-11-18T09:17:05  <Nealefelaen> he's counting his ants before they spawn? =D
2011-11-18T09:17:31  <antimatroid> yeah i want to make use of ants when they're going to have already been used to collect other food items and store there paths etc.
2011-11-18T09:17:45  <mcstar> i still dont store path
2011-11-18T09:17:47  <antimatroid> but to keep it semi optimal you need to know where ants are going to spawn
2011-11-18T09:17:49  <mcstar> no need to do that
2011-11-18T09:17:52  <antimatroid> yes there is
2011-11-18T09:17:55  <antimatroid> i want max time for battles
2011-11-18T09:18:08  <Fluxid> my design is completely different so i don't store paths either
2011-11-18T09:18:18  <mcstar> i tried, but it lead to errors
2011-11-18T09:18:27  <Nealefelaen> diffusion maps, I only look one step ahead
2011-11-18T09:18:28  <antimatroid> yeah cause you can't track where ants are going to spawn
2011-11-18T09:18:30  <mcstar> and my simpler approach was more efficient anyway
2011-11-18T09:18:35  <antimatroid> assuming worst of best case for a spawn leads to problems
2011-11-18T09:18:41  <antimatroid> worst or*
2011-11-18T09:18:47  <Yexo> Fluxid: same result. My own output has a move (which tcpclient also printed, so it got send to the server), but your logs have no mention of it anywhere
2011-11-18T09:19:06  <antimatroid> i really wish we were to output spawn orders
2011-11-18T09:19:07  <pairofdice> paclet loss?
2011-11-18T09:19:15  <Nealefelaen> antimatroid: you could sacrifice one ant per hive (as in it can't do anything) and then control the spawn location and time?
2011-11-18T09:19:40  <antimatroid> Nealefelaen: not always feasible and a pita to switch between when you do and don't have it set up
2011-11-18T09:19:50  <pairofdice> That's very inefficient when you have a few ants
2011-11-18T09:20:04  <Yexo> pairofdice: it's a tcp connection, that should take care of that
2011-11-18T09:20:09  <Nealefelaen> it is, but it's how you'd choose
2011-11-18T09:20:34  <pairofdice> Right, tcp...
2011-11-18T09:21:08  <antimatroid> when spawning at hills was implemented it really should have been done as an executed order :(
2011-11-18T09:21:22  <Nealefelaen> why?
2011-11-18T09:21:28  <pairofdice> To make it more complicated?
2011-11-18T09:21:32  <antimatroid> because it gives the user more control
2011-11-18T09:21:35  <antimatroid> that's less complicated
2011-11-18T09:21:49  <antimatroid> the starter bots could just pick a hive randomly and those who don't want to control spawning don't have to worry about it
2011-11-18T09:22:04  <Nealefelaen> you can only give the engine a location and a movement direction
2011-11-18T09:22:17  <antimatroid> i'm all for having the game be simple and seeing who can come up with the best strategy
2011-11-18T09:22:26  <Nealefelaen> anything more makes it more complicated.. and you can build any system you want on top of that
2011-11-18T09:22:32  <antimatroid> not make the specs so complicated to work with that you need to make everything all fiddly to do anything cool
2011-11-18T09:23:25  <Nealefelaen> if your AI needs to be able to control which hill will spawn an ant, then you have to have the overhead of implementing that =) ie, an ant sitting on top of the hives
2011-11-18T09:23:52  <antimatroid> i don't care as much about the overhead of using ants as I do about the problem of what to do when I don't have them all controlled
2011-11-18T09:23:53  <Zao> pairofdice: He has done it reliably for the last few times I've seen it.
2011-11-18T09:23:55  <antimatroid> i'm back to the same issue
2011-11-18T09:24:18  <antimatroid> so i guess my real question is, what's less suboptimal, assuming an ant will spawn at a hive in the worst case of time or best case of time?
2011-11-18T09:25:02  <antimatroid> if you assume the worst case then an ant might spawn there sooner than expected and you might use an ant from say another hive to collect food much slower, if you assume the best case then you might have been able to collect the food from another hive faster than an ant actually spawns
2011-11-18T09:25:06  <antimatroid> those are just two examples
2011-11-18T09:25:47  <Nealefelaen> my AI sits an ant near where food will spawn
2011-11-18T09:26:15  <antimatroid> mcstar: ?
2011-11-18T09:26:23  <mcstar> yes?
2011-11-18T09:26:34  <antimatroid> which is less suboptimal? :P
2011-11-18T09:26:46  <mcstar> i didnt follow
2011-11-18T09:26:52  <mcstar> let me read it
2011-11-18T09:27:36  <mcstar> i dont think this have a tangible effect
2011-11-18T09:27:45  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-11-18T09:27:51  <mcstar> if an ant will be in a better position just reschedule it
2011-11-18T09:27:55  <mcstar> you dont waste much
2011-11-18T09:27:57  <antimatroid> there are examples where both assumptions lead to suboptimal outcoems
2011-11-18T09:28:02  <mcstar> so what?
2011-11-18T09:28:15  <mcstar> i really think this is a minor concern
2011-11-18T09:28:15  <antimatroid> i build my bot around playing optimally for general simple examples :P
2011-11-18T09:28:26  <antimatroid> well, optimally under some kind of metric
2011-11-18T09:28:40  <antimatroid> and if i could control spawning it'd be more "optimal"
2011-11-18T09:28:52  <antimatroid> metric/measure whatever :P it's late
2011-11-18T09:29:30  <Yexo> Fluxid, mcstar, McLeopold: thanks for all your help. I'm still not sure where exactly the problem is, but my means to debug are exhausted. My computer sends the move, it appears nowhere in the engine logs. So for now I'm going to ignore this and disable the check for it in my bot
2011-11-18T09:29:42  <antimatroid> i think assuming the best case might be better

2011-11-18T09:30:39  <mcstar> Yexo: sure, if you have the time/willingness you could write a little bot that tests the engine
2011-11-18T09:30:57  <mcstar> but im still convinced the engine is correct
2011-11-18T09:31:47  <delt0r_> with this many folks watching games and stuff, i would be surprised that there is a issue that has not already been raised
2011-11-18T09:31:58  <Yexo> mcstar: I might try to do that sometime next week, but that'll take quite a bit of extra time
2011-11-18T09:32:22  <Yexo> frankly I've had enough of it for now, the bug is not in my bot and (probably, since the logs show nothing) not in the engine either

2011-11-18T09:33:43  <antimatroid> mcstar: reasoning?
2011-11-18T09:33:52  <mcstar> there's more to it then just eating the food
2011-11-18T09:34:02  <mcstar> while you are reaching it you explore territory too
2011-11-18T09:34:02  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-11-18T09:34:07  <mcstar> and that can be more important
2011-11-18T09:34:18  <mcstar> even if an ant will spawn closer to that particular food
2011-11-18T09:34:25  <mcstar> while the other ant didnt reach it
2011-11-18T09:34:29  <antimatroid> i am planning to do all these things similarly although with different prioirities
2011-11-18T09:34:50  <antimatroid> the problem is whether to assume an ant will spawn in the worst or best case for any situation?
2011-11-18T09:34:58  <mcstar> i think you should make an ant go where a food is irrelevant if you have anant hill lcoser or not
2011-11-18T09:35:20  <mcstar> still worst
2011-11-18T09:35:24  <mcstar> no reasoning
2011-11-18T09:35:29  <antimatroid> but then i'm not going to see if an ant spawns at the ant hill 3 moves away next turn
2011-11-18T09:35:30  <mcstar> i dont see the general case
2011-11-18T09:35:47  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-18T09:35:50  <antimatroid> not if i'm unsure of where it will spawn

2011-11-18T09:42:22  <mcstar> will the ant appear from the upper hill?
2011-11-18T09:42:30  <antimatroid> yes
2011-11-18T09:42:35  <antimatroid> but i can't block it while collecting the food?
2011-11-18T09:42:50  <antimatroid> not with the given scenario
2011-11-18T09:42:58  <mcstar> well, you need another ant that opens/closes the hill
2011-11-18T09:43:06  <antimatroid> that's not always possible
2011-11-18T09:43:19  <mcstar> antimatroid: i cant change the rules for you
2011-11-18T09:43:20  <antimatroid> even if i did that some of the time i'd have to make assumptiosn when i'm not blocking all relevant hills

2011-11-18T09:44:18  <pairofdice> You need to teach your ants some probability

2011-11-18T09:44:43  <pairofdice> I would explore with the left ant
2011-11-18T09:44:43  <antimatroid> i guess one option is if ants> x block hills, and if hills ! blocked recalculate all paths

2011-11-18T09:46:24  <antimatroid> pairofdice: that would be assuming the best case
2011-11-18T09:47:00  <pairofdice> Well, that ant could find more food
2011-11-18T09:48:12  <antimatroid> my problem is that once i assign an ant to food i want to enforce that unless say the ant doesn't turn up or the path becomes invalid (from more water information)
2011-11-18T09:48:39  <antimatroid> and if i assume the worst case then i'll assign the left 'a' to the top * and that could be rather suboptimal
2011-11-18T09:49:22  <antimatroid> whereas if i assume the best case then the worst that can happen is i move the left 'a' down and i have to move it back up in like 1 turn
2011-11-18T09:49:41  <antimatroid> of course it can tip more in the other direction depending on distances so i'm not really sure what's best
2011-11-18T09:50:03  <antimatroid> i think i should just go with recalculate all the paths when i don't have full information
2011-11-18T09:51:40  <mcstar> or all the time
2011-11-18T09:51:48  <Minthos> I recalculate paths for pretty much all my ants every round
2011-11-18T09:51:50  <antimatroid> but that's so expensive when there's lots of food

2011-11-18T09:51:59  <mcstar> never noticed it

2011-11-18T09:53:10  <HaraKiri> A* is ridiculously slow compared. i used it before, even implementing that god damn jps stuff
2011-11-18T09:53:31  <antimatroid> hdist(x) = min mdist(x, *) :)
2011-11-18T09:53:44  <antimatroid> that's an admissible heuristic for multiple targets, and multiple sources is easy

2011-11-18T09:56:43  <mcstar> the end-condition is very flexible this way
2011-11-18T09:56:50  <mcstar> i can test virtually for anything
2011-11-18T09:56:54  <antimatroid> ie. mark all ant locations as available in 0 turns, then bfs from ants to all food, collect a food with a shortest path and update information of when the moving ant will be available next to the food, also trying to track where the new ant will spawn, the researching with your availability information to the remaining food items iteratively?
2011-11-18T09:57:38  <HaraKiri> aren't lambda functions just tiny fuctions?
2011-11-18T09:57:41  <antimatroid> that can be quite slow, hence why i want to store the paths across turns, but not being able to track where ants will spawn presents the problems i've indicated
2011-11-18T09:57:49  <Minthos> eh no, just big dumb map one ant to each food
2011-11-18T09:58:06  <antimatroid> what do you mean by one ant to each food?
2011-11-18T09:58:06  <mcstar> HaraKiri: they can be of any size
2011-11-18T09:58:15  <pairofdice> Oh man, I have a lot to fix in my ant
2011-11-18T09:58:20  <antimatroid> that would involve f bfs's where f is the number of food squares yeah?
2011-11-18T09:58:32  <Minthos> each food gets exactly one ant assigned to it, the closest available in a greedy manner
2011-11-18T09:58:33  <mcstar> HaraKiri: the point is: i dot have to previously declare any function i would want to use as an end codition for different purposes
2011-11-18T09:58:41  <Minthos> no, 1 bfs for all food and all ants
2011-11-18T09:58:49  <antimatroid> yeah well i'm trying to be a little more sophisticated :P
2011-11-18T09:59:03  <Minthos> I don't see the point
2011-11-18T09:59:08  <pairofdice> If by sophisticated you mean slower ;)
2011-11-18T09:59:14  <mcstar> you could do that with function pointers and such, but with std::function its more convenient
2011-11-18T09:59:19  <Minthos> what pairofdice said
2011-11-18T09:59:26  <antimatroid> you will see :P
2011-11-18T09:59:38  <HaraKiri> if you use one bfs for all food, it can't be perfect path's afaik

2011-11-18T10:00:39  <Minthos> it's not "perfect" in the sense that for 2 adjacent foods they will both get an ant each even if it had been more efficient with just one for both

2011-11-18T10:03:04  <HaraKiri> mcstar: i still don't see how lambda functions can speed up bfs. anything fancy you can check for in lambda that you couldn't in a regular function?
2011-11-18T10:03:31  * avdg says hi
2011-11-18T10:03:31  <mcstar> HaraKiri: it speeds up food collection by being flexible
2011-11-18T10:03:40  <Minthos> lambda is just convenient syntax for passing code as arguments to functions
2011-11-18T10:03:40  <mcstar> not performance wise
2011-11-18T10:04:03  <HaraKiri> oh ok
2011-11-18T10:04:05  <Minthos> passing code as arguments to functions is what makes the search flexible
2011-11-18T10:04:34  <mcstar> your point?
2011-11-18T10:05:10  <Minthos> why does everything have to have a point, I was just explaining it to harakiri
2011-11-18T10:05:32  <mcstar> i thought he is familiar with that, just misunderstood what i said
2011-11-18T10:05:43  <mcstar> or rather i wasnt clear
2011-11-18T10:06:04  <Minthos> yeah so if you're looking for a point, you just gave it
2011-11-18T10:06:14  <HaraKiri> ive never used lambdas. i should probably look into it
2011-11-18T10:06:15  <lericson> HaraKiri: a lambda is an anonymous function, think of it as the function equivalent of local variables (where regular functions would be constants)
2011-11-18T10:06:58  <HaraKiri> im looking at examples at the moment. right now i wouldn't know where to use them, but sounds fancy
2011-11-18T10:07:16  <mcstar> Minthos: a thing that regular functions cant do is capturing variables from the context of their creation
2011-11-18T10:07:28  <mcstar> well, in a sense they capture them,but those are global variables
2011-11-18T10:08:10  <mcstar> HaraKiri: its been with us almost since the creation of proper programming languages
2011-11-18T10:08:38  <Minthos> mcstar: true, although you could send references/copies/whatever to the function calling the function you provide, but that gets a bit icky
2011-11-18T10:08:39  <mcstar> (high-level)
2011-11-18T10:08:42  <Yexo> https://github.com/berak/ants-tcp/pull/5 <- I hope that'll fix the problems
2011-11-18T10:08:42  <HaraKiri> i feel bad now :/. i only do stupid c++ numeric stuff, nothing fancy
2011-11-18T10:09:06  <Minthos> mcstar: I use D, which afaik doesn't have lambdas but something called delegates, which are functions coupled with state objects
2011-11-18T10:09:24  <Minthos> acheiving basically the same, just with slightly more syntax

2011-11-18T11:44:13  <a1k0n> seems to have trouble with mazes
2011-11-18T11:44:18  <mcstar> i can bundle it
2011-11-18T11:44:28  <bhasker> yea and also has no notion of defending its hill
2011-11-18T11:44:30  <Yexo> source is also ok
2011-11-18T11:44:37  <bhasker> haven't modified it except to work with the new state stuf
2011-11-18T11:44:59  <bhasker> it can raze other hills but not defends its own either
2011-11-18T11:45:22  <a1k0n> mine's pretty much the same
2011-11-18T11:45:39  <bhasker> yours is much better i think mine needs major rework

2011-11-18T11:46:09  <mcstar> Yexo: the source is on github
2011-11-18T11:46:18  <mcstar> but i went to all this trouble so you wont have to compile it

2011-11-18T11:50:58  <Yexo> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.4628 <- McLeopold something to look at for the final score. Game finishes with "rank stabilized" when orange loses it's final ant. However it keeps it's score for it's hills. This is again a situation where sacrificing your all your ants before your hill might lead to a better score

2011-11-18T11:53:02  <Yexo> McLeopold: I know. But if orange had lost it's hill before it's last ant it would've been a drawn between orange and blue
2011-11-18T11:53:14  <janzert> McLeopold: but he would have a score of 0 with current code right?
2011-11-18T11:53:14  <mcstar> ive got to eat now
2011-11-18T11:53:17  <mcstar> will be back
2011-11-18T11:53:35  <McLeopold> janzert: no
2011-11-18T11:53:49  <janzert> oh, I thought that was your latest change
2011-11-18T11:53:55  <McLeopold> only lone survivor hands out bonuses
2011-11-18T11:54:09  <janzert> ahh
2011-11-18T11:54:10  <McLeopold> only timeout or crash would remove hill points
2011-11-18T11:54:20  <Yexo> it's not about the bonus for yellow, but about the losing the bonus for ornage in this case
2011-11-18T11:54:45  <McLeopold> since orange lasted longer, I'm okay with it having a better score than blue
2011-11-18T11:55:10  <Yexo> that's a valid argument
2011-11-18T11:55:34  <McLeopold> so, in general, it is better to use every last ant to save a hill
2011-11-18T11:55:56  <Minthos> and if they can't save it, they had better die before it goes down
2011-11-18T11:56:09  <McLeopold> yep
2011-11-18T11:56:14  <Minthos> even if they're across the map
2011-11-18T11:56:26  <McLeopold> but then, why would you have ants across the map when you need to defend?
2011-11-18T11:56:32  <Yexo> not going to code it that way :) I've had too many games where I lost my hill but still was able to raze 1 or 2 other hills
2011-11-18T11:56:40  <Minthos> people do it all the time McLeopold
2011-11-18T11:56:53  <Yexo> you can't always see an attack coming in time
2011-11-18T11:56:54  <McLeopold> normal isn't always good
2011-11-18T11:57:00  <a1k0n> plus, getting food is defense
2011-11-18T11:57:31  <Minthos> well say you're gathering food and fighting on several fronts
2011-11-18T11:57:36  <McLeopold> overall, I don't think this is a big scoring issue
2011-11-18T11:57:40  <Minthos> then one of your fronts get swarmed
2011-11-18T11:57:57  <Minthos> you need pretty smart ai to drop everything and defend
2011-11-18T11:58:02  <Yexo> It's not a big issue at all. I was just curious what you thought of it after the other recent changes
2011-11-18T11:58:07  <Yexo> I'm fine with it either way
2011-11-18T11:58:29  <BenJackson> wow, I haven't submitted a new bot in over a week
2011-11-18T11:58:30  <McLeopold> a suicide is much different from an intentional crash
2011-11-18T11:58:46  <McLeopold> it is part of the game, so it is okay if it affects outcome

2011-11-18T12:03:19  <BenJackson> my tip re: xathis would be to put yourself in his place (pre-hills) and think about the tradeoffs then
2011-11-18T12:03:27  <Minthos> who's A on the official server? is he there at all? and is xathis on any tcp servers?
2011-11-18T12:03:35  <BenJackson> he's doing great and his bot is basically optimized for the scoring based on killing ants

2011-11-18T12:21:44  <a1k0n> there are funds committed to this contest
2011-11-18T12:21:57  <a1k0n> to be spent on ec2 hosting
2011-11-18T12:22:05  <HaraKiri> more than before?
2011-11-18T12:22:06  <goldcaddy77> I just wrote some visualizer code that lights up the water tiles like it's rainbow road from Mario Kart
2011-11-18T12:22:27  <Zao> I guess it would kind of suck running out of funds before the actual contest.
2011-11-18T12:22:27  <a1k0n> well, last i heard was they were waiting for a response from jeff to receive them

2011-11-18T12:27:27  <Anilm3> Is there any way to detect the case when my ants collide?
2011-11-18T12:27:38  <HaraKiri> dont judge me what the ants are doing or their orders. it's just for testing the visualizer :D
2011-11-18T12:27:55  <HaraKiri> collision = death, right?

2011-11-18T12:34:19  <g0llum> collision, food, water == ignored ; self, dead == will kill you.
2011-11-18T12:34:46  <Anilm3> I know what happens but how can you detect two of your ants have collided?
2011-11-18T12:35:02  <HaraKiri> when theyre not there anymore?
2011-11-18T12:35:16  <pairofdice> They're suddenly dead
2011-11-18T12:35:25  <Anilm3> how can you be sure they weren't killed by an enemy?
2011-11-18T12:35:46  <pairofdice> If there was no enemy close
2011-11-18T12:35:57  <Yexo> if you have two dead ants on the same tile they must have been killed by a collision
2011-11-18T12:36:09  <Yexo> 1 dead ant on a tile means either killed by collision with enemy or killed in a fight
2011-11-18T12:36:12  <Anilm3> Yexo: thanks!
2011-11-18T12:36:41  <Minthos> I don't think ants can collide with enemies?
2011-11-18T12:36:58  <Yexo> close to your hill or close to your opponents hill
2011-11-18T12:37:09  <goldcaddy77> HaraKiri, you get my pic?
2011-11-18T12:37:27  <HaraKiri> yes. pretty pretty lady! does it solve any practucal purpose? :D
2011-11-18T12:37:34  <Yexo> move next to hill, in the same turn an enemy ant spawns there. Your ant and the enemy ant are now next to eachother. If you move to the same tile they collide
2011-11-18T12:40:39  <Minthos> aha, so a spawned ant can actually move off its hill and crash into an enemy ant before any combat resolution is done
2011-11-18T12:41:18  <Yexo> or it remains there and an enemy tries to move on top of that hill
2011-11-18T12:41:26  <a1k0n> yes, but if it does that it's likely the enemy could just take the hill
2011-11-18T12:42:53  <goldcaddy77> HaraKiri: yes, but I can't share that info with you  :)
2011-11-18T12:43:13  <HaraKiri> you're such a tease ;p

2011-11-18T14:07:36  <HaraKiri> yes
2011-11-18T14:07:56  <mcstar> no background no grid and no button colors
2011-11-18T14:08:09  <mcstar> on win7 only button colors are missing
2011-11-18T14:08:25  <mcstar> thats platform independent widget toolkit

2011-11-18T14:08:47  <HaraKiri> hmm, so there should be that photo in the background? it isn't :<
2011-11-18T14:08:55  <mcstar> i cant even compile qt under windows in any way
2011-11-18T14:09:00  <mcstar> i wanted a static lib
2011-11-18T14:09:09  <mcstar> my linux qt compilation is flawless
2011-11-18T14:09:11  <HaraKiri> but there was no picture in the zipfile, that right?
2011-11-18T14:09:18  <mcstar> so im gonna package a linux binary and thats all
2011-11-18T14:09:26  <mcstar> HaraKiri: neednt be
2011-11-18T14:09:32  <HaraKiri> ok
2011-11-18T14:09:36  <mcstar> it is compiled in the exe
2011-11-18T14:09:41  <HaraKiri> fancy
2011-11-18T14:09:42  <mcstar> its a "resource"
2011-11-18T14:09:49  <mcstar> and the grid is computed, not static
2011-11-18T14:09:54  <mcstar> and that was missing too

2011-11-18T14:18:38  <HaraKiri> because now i feel that compulsory urge to clear the field every time by hand :x
2011-11-18T14:20:02  <mcstar> well, if you draw many ants...
2011-11-18T14:20:07  <mcstar> yeah i should add it
2011-11-18T14:20:52  <mcstar> but i dont think i will be bothered by windoz again
2011-11-18T14:21:10  <HaraKiri> sure
2011-11-18T14:22:46  <a1k0n> wtf?  are moves on top of food disallowed?

2011-11-18T14:23:31  <HaraKiri> yes, that struck me odd too
2011-11-18T14:23:57  <a1k0n> it's true?  i'm just inferring it from odd behavior here
2011-11-18T14:24:11  <a1k0n> i occasionally get moves disallowed and i see two of my ants just annihilated each other next to food
2011-11-18T14:24:18  <a1k0n> which is definitely not supposed to happen
2011-11-18T14:24:20  <HaraKiri> i had that problem when a food spawned next to my hill, and i couldnt move on it
2011-11-18T14:24:38  <a1k0n> that seems like a bug to me
2011-11-18T14:24:45  <Zannick> yeah, it's apparently disallowed for whatever reason
2011-11-18T14:24:56  <Zannick> i don't think i know the exact reasoning
2011-11-18T14:24:59  <a1k0n> damn it, well, i better fix that then
2011-11-18T14:26:50  <a1k0n> i can't find that in the spec
2011-11-18T14:27:16  <a1k0n> oh there it is.  blocking.

2011-11-18T14:30:53  <treeform> what is disalowd?
2011-11-18T14:31:00  <a1k0n> moving on top of food
2011-11-18T14:31:00  <treeform> ramming your ants together?
2011-11-18T14:31:13  <treeform> oh how can you move on top of food?
2011-11-18T14:31:18  <a1k0n> i had an ant that expected to move onto food and another one that expected to take its place
2011-11-18T14:31:28  <treeform> oh
2011-11-18T14:31:35  <a1k0n> instead, the first move was blocked and they collided
2011-11-18T14:32:37  <treeform> but dont ants collect the food as soon as they are next to it?
2011-11-18T14:33:32  <a1k0n> it spawned right next to me the previous turn
2011-11-18T14:34:04  <treeform> and you could see it? and it was not collected?
2011-11-18T14:34:31  <a1k0n> yes, you move, then collect food, then more food spawns
2011-11-18T14:34:43  <a1k0n> so if it spawns next to you you have to sit still for a turn
2011-11-18T14:37:22  <mcstar> it
2011-11-18T14:37:30  <mcstar> it's only logical, captain

2011-11-18T14:39:26  <goldcaddy77> then the 2nd one wouldn't have moved there because your first guy was there

2011-11-18T16:05:15  <mcstar> can you try me something?
2011-11-18T16:05:17  <Yexo> sure
2011-11-18T16:05:20  <mcstar> have you still got the binary?
2011-11-18T16:05:23  <Yexo> yes
2011-11-18T16:05:33  <mcstar> try to run it with -style
2011-11-18T16:05:44  <mcstar> and style might be plastique
2011-11-18T16:05:50  <mcstar> or windows
2011-11-18T16:06:04  <mcstar> maybe cleanlooks
2011-11-18T16:06:44  <mcstar> it seems after a bit reading that the buttons are not colored because that particular windows style doesnt support it
2011-11-18T16:06:48  <Yexo> all those 3 options give me coloured buttons but none of them give the background image
2011-11-18T16:06:54  <mcstar> yay
2011-11-18T16:07:09  <mcstar> are you using windows xp style by default?
2011-11-18T16:07:21  <Yexo> no, windows 7 with default style
2011-11-18T16:07:21  <mcstar> that blue/green/silver thing?
2011-11-18T16:07:25  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-11-18T16:07:41  <mcstar> on win7 the button text is colored
2011-11-18T16:07:56  <mcstar> and you dont see the background or the grind under win7?
2011-11-18T16:08:01  <Yexo> only for the clicked button
2011-11-18T16:08:06  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-18T16:08:11  <Yexo> and no background image
2011-11-18T16:08:19  <mcstar> that becomes "disabled" and the text becomes colored
2011-11-18T16:08:26  <mcstar> ok, so this solves part of the problem
2011-11-18T16:08:40  <mcstar> for me, win7 showed the background image and the grid
2011-11-18T16:12:02  <mcstar> Yexo: ok, it seems i have to provide a jpeg dll

2011-11-18T18:02:05  <LouisMartin> Guys, if you had to bet money on a bot, which one would it be?  (you can't choose yours)
2011-11-18T18:02:53  <LouisMartin> and as importantly, why this bot?
2011-11-18T18:04:02  <mcstar> LouisMartin: i'd bet yours
2011-11-18T18:04:18  <mcstar> why? bc i have such a high confidence in you
2011-11-18T18:05:12  <LouisMartin> and I'd bet yours
2011-11-18T18:05:20  <LouisMartin> bc I think money is a sin
2011-11-18T18:05:25  <LouisMartin> ;)
2011-11-18T18:05:49  <LouisMartin> I really have no bot deserving such appellation, yet
2011-11-18T18:06:41  <mcstar> LouisMartin: i dont find your original question really meaningful
2011-11-18T18:06:46  <mcstar> are you on windows?
2011-11-18T18:06:49  <LouisMartin> ranking aside, which bot has impressed you the more yet mcstar?   could be a bad with a cool feature.
2011-11-18T18:07:01  <mcstar> i dont watch replays
2011-11-18T18:07:10  <mcstar> except when somebody links them in
2011-11-18T18:07:15  <mcstar> here
2011-11-18T18:07:19  <mcstar> so windows?
2011-11-18T18:08:06  <LouisMartin> The question is which bot do you think as the most odd of winning this contest based on your observations/evaluations/whatever ?
2011-11-18T18:08:39  <LouisMartin> I run MS-Dos 6.11, why?
2011-11-18T18:08:47  <mcstar> now really
2011-11-18T18:09:34  <mcstar> is this really so hard to answer?
2011-11-18T18:09:46  <LouisMartin> don't judge, it's stable as hell and the Link text web browser is perfect for my literal pron needs
2011-11-18T18:09:47  <mcstar> you will miss something...
2011-11-18T18:09:53  <LouisMartin> Yes, Windows 7
2011-11-18T18:09:56  <mcstar> k
2011-11-18T18:10:06  <LouisMartin> and Ubuntu
2011-11-18T18:10:06  <mcstar> http://min.us/lpE8SN0vq9cGS
2011-11-18T18:10:10  <mcstar> could you try this?
2011-11-18T18:10:14  <LouisMartin> let me see
2011-11-18T18:10:22  <mcstar> i bundled an app just couple of minutes ago
2011-11-18T18:10:28  <mcstar> useful little tool
2011-11-18T18:11:07  <LouisMartin> in an emulator?  yes, no prob
2011-11-18T18:11:07  <LouisMartin> brb
2011-11-18T18:11:24  <mcstar> LouisMartin: you dont need an emulator
2011-11-18T18:11:44  <mcstar> and there is a linux version but i want to distribute it with static libs but its not ready
2011-11-18T18:13:10  <LouisMartin> nothing personal; I just don't run exec like that on my main win7
2011-11-18T18:13:28  <LouisMartin> booting up the emu (XP is fine?)
2011-11-18T18:13:50  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-18T18:14:06  <mcstar> LouisMartin: its ok, someone stole my nick a 2 days ago
2011-11-18T18:14:17  <mcstar> LouisMartin: you can trust liquid-phynix however
2011-11-18T18:14:26  <mcstar> my github account and my minus account
2011-11-18T18:14:46  <LouisMartin> stole your nick and did what?
2011-11-18T18:14:57  <mcstar> just spoke here
2011-11-18T18:15:03  <mcstar> but amstan kicked him
2011-11-18T18:16:57  <LouisMartin> lol ok
2011-11-18T18:18:13  <LouisMartin> oh :D   that's nice mcstar
2011-11-18T18:18:42  <LouisMartin> I will use it to test some ideas I had
2011-11-18T18:18:46  <mcstar> k
2011-11-18T18:18:51  <LouisMartin> thanks
2011-11-18T18:18:55  <mcstar> right button erases
2011-11-18T18:19:04  <LouisMartin> good to know
2011-11-18T18:19:11  <mcstar> thats all basically
2011-11-18T18:19:16  <mcstar> you ca drag and paint
2011-11-18T18:19:19  <mcstar> can*
2011-11-18T18:19:20  <LouisMartin> so you worked on your battle algo?
2011-11-18T18:19:26  <mcstar> a little
2011-11-18T18:19:31  <mcstar> i did this app yesterday
2011-11-18T18:19:38  <mcstar> put the battle resolution in it
2011-11-18T18:19:47  <mcstar> and today i was trying to build it for windows
2011-11-18T18:19:50  <mcstar> what a waste of time
2011-11-18T18:20:15  <mcstar> theres soon gonna be a linux package if you want that...
2011-11-18T18:21:02  <LouisMartin> it's never a lost of time if you enjoyed the coding
2011-11-18T18:21:12  <LouisMartin> plus it can be useful for others
2011-11-18T18:21:22  <LouisMartin> did you posted it in the forum?
2011-11-18T18:22:36  <mcstar> LouisMartin: i meant trying to build it on windows, that was a major waste of time
2011-11-18T18:23:01  <LouisMartin> ah, right
2011-11-18T18:23:03  <mcstar> no i didnt post it there, i dont use forums
2011-11-18T18:24:02  <LouisMartin> if you plan on improving something on it, I'd suggest showing the attack range arround an ant when the mouse is over it
2011-11-18T18:24:17  <LouisMartin> and a check box to enable seeing all attack range at all time
2011-11-18T18:24:22  <LouisMartin> that'd be great
2011-11-18T18:24:57  <mcstar> that can be done
2011-11-18T18:25:10  <mcstar> but i want to improve on my bot first
2011-11-18T18:25:38  <LouisMartin> how's your bot?
2011-11-18T18:26:42  <mcstar> sucks at hill defense
2011-11-18T18:27:14  <LouisMartin> I see
2011-11-18T18:28:04  <LouisMartin> btw, your software just showed me I wasn't grasping correctly / completely the battle resolution ..
2011-11-18T18:28:57  <LouisMartin> which is disturbing, cause I don't put your algo in question.
2011-11-18T18:29:10  <mcstar> i think its correct
2011-11-18T18:29:15  <mcstar> i use that same al in my bot
2011-11-18T18:29:18  <mcstar> alg.
2011-11-18T18:29:35  <mcstar> and ive tested it in situations that were mentioned here

2011-11-18T19:12:41  <antimatroid> i think my cpu is only 32 bit
2011-11-18T19:12:45  <mcstar> nooo
2011-11-18T19:12:51  <mcstar> you machine is 64
2011-11-18T19:13:07  <antimatroid> can i check aha?
2011-11-18T19:13:08  <mcstar> you told me some time ago that its better than mine
2011-11-18T19:13:50  <mcstar> uname -p
2011-11-18T19:13:55  <mcstar> checks the processor

2011-11-18T19:15:49  <antimatroid> /proc/cpuinfo is meant to give me cpu info

2011-11-18T19:15:58  <antimatroid> i'm not very good with linux :P
2011-11-18T19:16:07  <mcstar> just use uname -a and uname -m

2011-11-18T19:16:34  <mcstar> cpuinfo doesnt tell you directly what does your os/cpu supports

2011-11-18T19:20:52  <mcstar> antimatroid: will you pls install qt?
2011-11-18T19:21:13  <mcstar> and you could compile it directly from github
2011-11-18T19:21:22  <mcstar> and i would like to have that executable
2011-11-18T19:21:32  <mcstar> along with a couple of qt libs
2011-11-18T19:21:43  <mcstar> and i would put that alongside the others
2011-11-18T19:21:55  <mcstar> BenJackson: are you on 64bit?
2011-11-18T19:22:10  <BenJackson> I ran your win build on win 7 64
2011-11-18T19:22:13  <antimatroid> mcstar: but mehffort! :(
2011-11-18T19:22:23  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-11-18T19:22:30  <mcstar> BenJackson: you are excused
2011-11-18T19:22:33  <BenJackson> my server is a 64-bit freebsd machine
2011-11-18T19:22:42  <BenJackson> I don't think any of my linuxes or vms are 64
2011-11-18T19:22:49  <mcstar> really?
2011-11-18T19:22:56  <mcstar> i thought its natural by now
2011-11-18T19:23:14  <BenJackson> well my EMC2 install is on pretty old hardware
2011-11-18T19:23:26  <BenJackson> the rest of the linuxes I ever boot are VMs
2011-11-18T19:24:00  <BenJackson> actually the most recent linux install I did was on a PPC (old ibook) :)
2011-11-18T19:24:43  <mcstar> i tried ubuntu on a powerbook ~2 years ago
2011-11-18T19:25:02  <mcstar> was slower than 10.5
2011-11-18T19:25:14  <BenJackson> they quit updating OSX for this some time ago
2011-11-18T19:25:19  <mcstar> antimatroid: is that a no?
2011-11-18T19:25:25  <BenJackson> and I put a CF in to replace the HD when it died
2011-11-18T19:25:28  <mcstar> its just a couple of commands really
2011-11-18T19:25:31  <BenJackson> and OSX couldn't resume after that
2011-11-18T19:25:33  <BenJackson> ubuntu can!
2011-11-18T19:25:38  <antimatroid> mcstar: how long would it take? i have other things to do that sound more fun :P
2011-11-18T19:25:39  <mcstar> but if youre busy  i can udnerstand

2011-11-18T19:41:50  <thestinger> after my experience with oblivion and fallout 3, I've decided to wait a year before getting it xD
2011-11-18T19:42:10  <BenJackson> I didn't know anything about it until someone said "it's fallout 3: middle earth"
2011-11-18T19:42:15  <BenJackson> then I had to have it
2011-11-18T19:42:49  <mcstar> junkies
2011-11-18T19:43:49  <thestinger> I think I'll just solve my combat problems with more breadth-first searches, everything else seems like it will take more than 5 lines of code
2011-11-18T19:44:24  <BenJackson> I keep writing elegant, fast algorithms which don't quite optmize the right thing
2011-11-18T19:44:36  <BenJackson> I really need a mind wipe so I can approach the problem anew
2011-11-18T19:45:30  <Minthos> I just wrote code to detect if a map is a maze or not
2011-11-18T19:45:33  <mcstar> do you have hard liquor in mind?
2011-11-18T19:45:51  <Minthos> it seems useful to adjust behavior based on that info
2011-11-18T19:46:40  <thestinger> now we need half-maze maps
2011-11-18T19:46:44  <a1k0n> BenJackson: heh.  i was thinking the same

2011-11-18T19:47:25  <BenJackson> hell no, we need all maze maps.  I'm good with mazes:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=104201&user=3473
2011-11-18T19:47:33  <Minthos> but what if my maze detection really is just an adjustable bias? then it will correctly account for half-maze maps as well
2011-11-18T19:47:54  <a1k0n> i'm spectacularly bad at that two-player maze map
2011-11-18T19:48:13  <a1k0n> the hills are so far apart that i basically consider them worth 0 until someone comes to attack and then i retaliate
2011-11-18T19:50:45  <BenJackson> I can definitely see scaling issues in that game for my code, too
2011-11-18T19:50:49  <BenJackson> the distances are much larger than typical
2011-11-18T19:51:33  <BenJackson> a1k0n: I actually have a semi-related problem:  my bot isn't good at randomly distributing itself
2011-11-18T19:51:44  <BenJackson> but if enemies lead it around and food lures it it will get spread out
2011-11-18T19:51:58  <BenJackson> but once it gets clumpy it's bad at de-clumping
2011-11-18T19:52:17  <BenJackson> that's one of the reason I'm pretty good at multi-hill maze
2011-11-18T20:02:41  <antimatroid> i love the maze maps :P
2011-11-18T20:03:33  <thestinger> yeah, I dislike the really open maps

2011-11-18T20:04:48  <a1k0n> a couple of the randomwalk maps have really evil one-wide passes in them which is cool
2011-11-18T20:04:57  <antimatroid> multi hills are annoying
2011-11-18T20:05:09  <treeform> my bot kind of does ok on multi hills
2011-11-18T20:05:22  <treeform> i guess its more defensive
2011-11-18T20:05:48  <Minthos> the server is so confused about my bot's skill that it matched me up against pguillory

2011-11-18T21:22:06  <flag> But to Minthos' point, when the map isn't full of ants it doesn't really matter if your algo is suboptimal
2011-11-18T21:22:13  <antimatroid> besh: one option is to continue "collecting not recently seen squares"
2011-11-18T21:22:30  <antimatroid> or you can iteratively move ants so they're furthest away from their closest friend
2011-11-18T21:22:48  <antimatroid> possible ordering which ants you move by their average distance or shortest distance to a friend or something?
2011-11-18T21:23:57  <antimatroid> i don't mark squares as "visible", i mark them as "lastSeen"
2011-11-18T21:24:08  <besh> antimatroid: Thanks for the ideas. I tried a static division of the map in to 40 x 40  and send 1 ant per corner. But it didn't work very well.
2011-11-18T21:24:19  <Minthos> I just send some of my idle ants to the closest point where I don't have vision
2011-11-18T21:24:27  <Minthos> also using many-to-many bfs
2011-11-18T21:25:01  <antimatroid> if you're collecting "not recently seen squares", one thing i found useful during beta was to "bomb vision information" around each location collected, so you didn't send lots of ants to the same patch of non-visible squares
2011-11-18T21:25:03  <Minthos> it's not a complete solution, but it seems to work fairly well

2011-11-18T21:25:54  <antimatroid> but if your number of uncollected food squares is not too large then i think a* is still worthwhile

2011-11-18T21:28:24  <Minthos> uncollected food is usually very low, but I treat enemies near my hives as food as well so it could potentially grow quite big
2011-11-18T21:28:36  <besh> antimatroid: Yes, I also replaced the isVisible() array of the java starter package to return when it was last seen. More useful.
2011-11-18T21:28:55  <Minthos> and besides, it's one of several bfses I do each round, I don't see any need to make it faster
2011-11-18T21:28:58  <antimatroid> Minthos: i plan to "protect and invade" hives before collecting food
2011-11-18T21:29:06  <antimatroid> and run battles first up
2011-11-18T21:30:10  <antimatroid> i think i'm going to have to just recalculate every turn
2011-11-18T21:30:14  <antimatroid> i'll see how long it takes :(
2011-11-18T21:30:58  <Minthos> "hey look, there's lots and lots of food over there!" "actually I was kidding it isn't actually food it's enemies. Your nation is proud of your sacrifice!"
2011-11-18T21:32:01  <antimatroid> lol
2011-11-18T21:32:14  <Minthos> my bfs was much faster when I didn't take different cost for each tile into account
2011-11-18T21:32:27  <Minthos> then I could run one bfs for each ant
2011-11-18T21:33:08  <Minthos> now I don't use it for individual pathfinding, only for groups
2011-11-18T21:33:27  <Minthos> and in practice, that's more than fast enough
2011-11-18T21:34:24  <Minthos> it turns out there aren't that many use cases where you need lots of criss-crossing paths

2011-11-18T22:33:14  <LouisMartin> ahh lol
2011-11-18T22:33:18  <LouisMartin> alright
2011-11-18T22:33:40  <thestinger> I'm just using BFS to make distance maps, with a larger increment than 1 when going from a tile with an ant to another tile
2011-11-18T22:33:57  <LouisMartin> btw, what is that map and the "lazybot" standard in the package?
2011-11-18T22:34:09  <thestinger> I just took hunterbot and deleted all the logic
2011-11-18T22:34:29  <thestinger> the map is the tutorial map with some ants pre-added (you can use --scenario to start with ants/food on the map)
2011-11-18T22:35:14  <LouisMartin> okay, I see. I'll check that. thanks
2011-11-18T22:35:41  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/510064/ that's how you do it basically (that's the map file)
2011-11-18T22:36:09  <LouisMartin> I guess you must know "focus battle resolution" well by now. can you take a look at this? http://i.imgur.com/8aXEi.png
2011-11-18T22:36:55  <thestinger> I basically just took the python code from that page and wrote a simulate() function in C++
2011-11-18T22:37:04  <LouisMartin> the top-left would be equal to the top-right in terms of who dies?  (the result at the bottom for the top-right one)

2011-11-18T22:40:18  <thestinger> LouisMartin: I think all 3 ants die in that top left one
2011-11-18T22:40:21  <thestinger> I could be wrong
2011-11-18T22:40:48  <thestinger> well, all 3 on both sides
2011-11-18T22:41:05  <LouisMartin> yes, makes sense to me
2011-11-18T22:41:32  <amstan> How do people calculate manhattan distances on the map?
2011-11-18T22:41:39  <amstan> because you can't just take the diff between points
2011-11-18T22:41:45  <thestinger> I don't anymore
2011-11-18T22:41:50  <LouisMartin> but the top-right scenario would have the same 6 ants to die even if blue is overpowering the 2 top red ants that much?
2011-11-18T22:41:57  <amstan> thestinger: how do you pathfind then? gradients?
2011-11-18T22:42:08  <thestinger> BFS out from a target, marking distances in a 2D array
2011-11-18T22:42:23  <thestinger> can do a multi-source BFS for multiple targets, start them off at something other than 0, etc.
2011-11-18T22:42:38  <amstan> wel, i need to pathfind between bases to check if they're ocnnected
2011-11-18T22:42:39  <thestinger> that way I get "real" (assuming unexplored areas are land) distances, and pathfinding
2011-11-18T22:43:14  <amstan> i was hoping to do a* so it's fast
2011-11-18T22:43:14  <Minthos> ((rowa - rowb + map.rows) % map.rows) + same thing for cols
2011-11-18T22:43:48  <amstan> Minthos: that gives you lowest diff?
2011-11-18T22:44:19  <Minthos> if my math is correct yes, but it's 4.44 am here so it may not be
2011-11-18T22:44:45  <thestinger> amstan: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/tDVWZJ2uKmcfM6dZ7LoQ/ I was doing that when I still used manhattan distance
2011-11-18T22:44:49  <amstan> i don't think that'll work
2011-11-18T22:44:56  <amstan> what if i have a point at 1 and mapsize-1
2011-11-18T22:45:03  <amstan> i should get something like 2 for diff
2011-11-18T22:45:12  <Minthos> yeah
2011-11-18T22:45:12  <amstan> but i'll get the long way
2011-11-18T22:45:15  <Minthos> no
2011-11-18T22:45:23  <Minthos> % is modulo
2011-11-18T22:45:35  <amstan> rowa=1, rowb=9, rows=10
2011-11-18T22:45:36  <thestinger> well, % is remainder is C/C++ :P
2011-11-18T22:45:40  <thestinger> in*
2011-11-18T22:45:46  <amstan> 1-9+10=2
2011-11-18T22:45:47  <amstan> fine
2011-11-18T22:45:50  <amstan> what about the other way?
2011-11-18T22:46:01  <amstan> 9-1+10=18%10=8
2011-11-18T22:46:09  <amstan> not good
2011-11-18T22:46:16  <Minthos> remainder, modulo same difference when you make sure it's always positive by adding the map dimension before moduloing
2011-11-18T22:46:30  <amstan> thestinger: min you say! good idea
2011-11-18T22:46:40  <LouisMartin> y = Y2 - Y1 % Map.Height;  if (y < 0) y = y + Map.Height;      and same for X

2011-11-18T23:22:59  <BenJackson> yeah, most of my work has been in coming up with clever data structures that let me search the solution space quickly

2011-11-18T23:24:04  <BenJackson_> well I missed anything you just said
2011-11-18T23:24:05  <Antimony> just to solve 13 ants
2011-11-18T23:24:18  <Antimony> and that's without even considering combat
2011-11-18T23:24:45  <thestinger> BenJackson_: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/sSoINQoN0CuIxCgI3DMC/ <- what you missed

2011-11-18T23:28:03  <Scryer> Scenario maps? Is that where you can set up a specific situation to test against?
2011-11-18T23:28:09  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-18T23:28:37  <thestinger> I like my old code vs my new code with a preset situation
2011-11-18T23:28:41  <Scryer> Sounds very useful.
2011-11-18T23:28:42  <thestinger> I like testing*

2011-11-18T23:29:19  <thestinger> when I'm looking for something specific running a bunch of games and looking through them to find something like that is a waste
2011-11-18T23:29:55  <Scryer> I get situations like "OK, why did I forget that enemy hill was there and go into my far-back backup random mode?" Not sure how to set that up with a specific map.
2011-11-18T23:30:29  <thestinger> well, you can make a scenario with ants/water/hills placed in the same locations as when you had the problem
2011-11-18T23:30:31  <BenJackson> thestinger: I see you have 0.6 more skill than me on aichallenge now
2011-11-18T23:30:47  <thestinger> :), might just be a lucky streak

2011-11-18T23:31:07  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2255 my pre-combat version is somehow rank 15
2011-11-18T23:31:11  <BenJackson> I've been resisting "tweaking" mine because I think I need to get out of a rut
2011-11-18T23:31:12  <thestinger> seriously, no awareness of enemy ants o_o
2011-11-18T23:31:23  <BenJackson> probably closer to the end I'll resign myself to trying to notch a few more positions
2011-11-18T23:31:32  <BenJackson> really?  wow
2011-11-18T23:31:41  <thestinger> actually the version on the site might pathfind a bit different based on enemy ants, I forget exactly how old it is
2011-11-18T23:31:47  <thestinger> definitely no combat though
2011-11-18T23:32:10  <thestinger> I really can't tell if it's just getting lucky or doing something right
2011-11-18T23:32:54  <BenJackson> hey I hadn't watched this one:
2011-11-18T23:32:55  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=103264&user=2255
2011-11-18T23:32:57  <BenJackson> gang's all here
2011-11-18T23:33:06  <BenJackson> in that one I'd say you were lucky!
2011-11-18T23:33:17  <thestinger> I've been making a git tag for each version I upload so I can actually check and see which revision that is
2011-11-18T23:33:18  <BenJackson> seeing as how you got your points after losing your hill :)
2011-11-18T23:34:05  <thestinger> yeah, that was before combat and proper foraging xD
2011-11-18T23:35:03  <BenJackson> I'm surprised at how well my v7 is doing considering some major bugs I found in the combat code

2011-11-18T23:36:06  <thestinger> the version on the site does have some primitive avoidance of enemies, but it actually made my bot worse than it was based on tcp testing (and all that old code is deleted now)
2011-11-18T23:36:29  <Antimony> So what are scenario maps and how do you get them?
2011-11-18T23:36:30  <BenJackson> yeah one of my early hacks to just avoid suiciding into things I didn't *mean* to suicide into helped

2011-11-18T23:36:46  <thestinger> Antimony: you just edit a map file (or make one manually)
2011-11-18T23:36:47  <BenJackson> but real combat superceded that
2011-11-18T23:37:24  <thestinger> Antimony: if you run play_game with --scenario, it uses pre-placed food/ants
2011-11-18T23:37:43  <thestinger> example: http://pastie.org/2886770
2011-11-18T23:37:48  <Antimony> oh
2011-11-18T23:37:55  <Antimony> that would be very helpful
2011-11-18T23:37:57  <jab_bott> how do I run the standalone visualizer?
2011-11-18T23:40:52  <BenJackson> that's quite a challenge for player 0
2011-11-18T23:41:15  <BenJackson> if your map is asymmetric like that one you need --food none I think
2011-11-18T23:44:04  <thestinger> yeah, I use --food none with that one
2011-11-18T23:44:16  <BenJackson> ok, this will be an interesting challenge
2011-11-18T23:44:21  <thestinger> http://paste.aichallenge.org/BSKrh/
2011-11-18T23:44:33  <BenJackson> I'll see if I can get an updated bot of mine to beat a prior version as blue
2011-11-18T23:44:41  <thestinger> I have some weird movement code bugs I need to fix
2011-11-18T23:45:22  <BenJackson> one I just found was that my low-level code prevented ants trading positions
2011-11-18T23:45:26  <BenJackson> but the combat code would do that sometimes
2011-11-18T23:45:36  <BenJackson> so the low-level code would fuck up the combat
2011-11-18T23:45:49  <thestinger> if blue is actually a sane bot that will be pretty impossible xD
2011-11-18T23:46:04  <BenJackson> well just to prove I've fixed my bugs
