2012-03-22T01:58:10  <antimatroid> although it'd probably rule me out as a competitor doing that?
2012-03-22T02:01:33  <antimatroid> @later tell mleise we have considered using cpu time rather than wall time in the past and have always concluded it's just not going to work across languages and platforms

2012-03-22T02:50:54  <mleise> I don't quite remember how bad those inaccuracies are. It could also be handled like they do with some online gaming competitions, where the final round is played on trusted computers (Amazon servers in our case)
2012-03-22T02:52:20  <mleise> That would fix the time frame and cost, but means that the ranking code must be known to work in advance *g*

2012-03-22T14:12:33  <g0llum> so, there's a branch for every game ?
2012-03-22T14:13:14  <smiley1983> g0llum: that's how I've organized it for now; there might be a better way.
2012-03-22T14:13:55  <g0llum> still needs the rules in the readme, or links to the forum, but: *incredible* ;)
2012-03-22T14:14:04  <smiley1983> It's actually quite a small change to add another game (now that I've worked it out) if the game engine uses the same assumption as the ants one
2012-03-22T14:14:46  <smiley1983> I'm quite pleased with it myself, now I'm just hoping someone can host it :)
