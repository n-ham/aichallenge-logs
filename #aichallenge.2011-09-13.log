2011-09-13T14:44:01  <mcstar> you need to be an "expert" to write a crappy engine speed-wise
2011-09-13T14:44:39  <mcstar> whenever i read that manuscript im amazed
2011-09-13T14:44:43  <mcstar> and confused
2011-09-13T14:44:47  <mcstar> and idk
2011-09-13T14:44:53  <mcstar> its really interesting
2011-09-13T14:44:57  <delt0r> I have not had that much beer... but i use german keyboards with us layouts, us keyboards and then finally some other keyboard layout
2011-09-13T14:45:25  <mcstar> i used german layout for a couple of yers
2011-09-13T14:45:27  <mcstar> a
2011-09-13T14:45:32  <delt0r> so 3 different layouts... makes for interesting touch typing
2011-09-13T14:45:51  <mcstar> yeah, i decided to use hungarian even for coding
2011-09-13T14:45:58  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-13T14:46:03  <delt0r> and comments?
2011-09-13T14:46:09  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-09-13T14:46:21  <delt0r> had some java source way back in Japanese
2011-09-13T14:46:23  <mcstar> the keyboard is hungarian too, as i am
2011-09-13T14:46:35  <mcstar> as am i*
2011-09-13T14:46:36  <delt0r> yea but do you use that in the code?
2011-09-13T14:46:42  <mcstar> noway
2011-09-13T14:46:45  <mcstar> only english
2011-09-13T14:46:47  <delt0r> aka hungarian function names
2011-09-13T14:47:14  <delt0r> it really is not fair... but dam am i luck i was born in a english first lan country
2011-09-13T14:47:14  <mcstar> but i use when icode in c the hungarian convention
2011-09-13T14:47:26  <delt0r> ??
2011-09-13T14:47:33  <mcstar> i guess its called that, when you type cases like this: thisIsMyVariable
2011-09-13T14:47:44  <delt0r> init caps
2011-09-13T14:47:54  <mcstar> all but the first word
2011-09-13T14:47:58  <mcstar> and no underscore
2011-09-13T14:48:20  <delt0r> i hate underscores... but use them when doing C since that what is typically expected
2011-09-13T14:48:52  <mcstar> in lisp people separate words with dashes
2011-09-13T14:49:01  <mcstar> *my-global-variable*
2011-09-13T14:49:10  <mcstar> and they usually dont really abbreviate
2011-09-13T14:49:31  <delt0r> yea--but the conventions have very special meaning
2011-09-13T14:49:32  <mcstar> when i went back to c, i scratched my head for a while, cause my source didnt compile
2011-09-13T14:49:35  <delt0r> like set!
2011-09-13T14:49:50  <mcstar> it turned out, i used - in my source lol
2011-09-13T14:49:54  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-13T14:50:11  <mcstar> i even showed to a collegue of mine, whats wrong???

2011-09-13T14:51:34  <delt0r> but i got old
2011-09-13T14:51:39  <delt0r> like 18 or something
2011-09-13T14:51:40  <delt0r> ;)
2011-09-13T14:51:57  <mcstar> you quit the scene when you were 18?
2011-09-13T14:52:02  <delt0r> must say the standard has only got better
2011-09-13T14:52:18  <delt0r> well when i left high school...
2011-09-13T14:52:23  <delt0r> so 17 --
2011-09-13T14:52:33  <delt0r> and 362 days ;)
2011-09-13T14:52:36  <mcstar> i didnt really program up until the end of high-school
2011-09-13T14:52:52  <delt0r> not really left ..just didn't do it anymore
2011-09-13T14:52:58  <mcstar> my first linux distro was a broken suse 8.2
2011-09-13T14:53:03  <delt0r> wow
2011-09-13T14:53:14  <delt0r> mine was slackware 1.0
2011-09-13T14:53:26  <mcstar> by broken i mean broken, the cd's werewritten with errors
2011-09-13T14:53:28  <delt0r> 1996 IIRC or 1997
2011-09-13T14:53:31  <mcstar> i couldnt use it
2011-09-13T14:53:35  <delt0r> dam
2011-09-13T14:53:47  <delt0r> back in those days, CD cost real money
2011-09-13T14:53:53  <delt0r> CDs
2011-09-13T14:53:53  <mcstar> so are you a slacker still?
2011-09-13T14:53:57  <delt0r> oh yea
2011-09-13T14:54:06  <delt0r> wearing the tshrit today even
2011-09-13T14:54:22  <mcstar> (i copied those, from the school's sysadmin)
2011-09-13T14:54:51  <mcstar> well, im an archer these days
2011-09-13T14:55:00  <delt0r> back in slack 1.0, if you wanted X windows. You had to write the video drivers
2011-09-13T14:55:01  <mcstar> actually for a couple of yeaRS, like 3
2011-09-13T14:55:11  <delt0r> not used archer
2011-09-13T14:55:23  <mcstar> its ArchLinux
2011-09-13T14:55:30  <mcstar> so who uses it is an archer
2011-09-13T14:55:32  <delt0r> I personally like the fact there is a flavor for every user
2011-09-13T14:55:36  <delt0r> Yea i know
2011-09-13T14:55:48  <delt0r> oh ic
2011-09-13T14:55:55  <delt0r> typo is something i do
2011-09-13T14:55:59  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-13T14:56:13  <delt0r> like the supergrid->multigrid
2011-09-13T14:56:37  <mcstar> yeah, i realized i read about multigrid when i wrote an adaptive mesh refiner
2011-09-13T14:56:40  <mcstar> in charm++
2011-09-13T14:56:42  <delt0r> for someone in science you would think i would be more precise
2011-09-13T14:56:45  <mcstar> circa 2008
2011-09-13T14:57:07  <delt0r> at the time... they where a big break through
2011-09-13T14:57:21  <mcstar> this is all very informal
2011-09-13T14:57:22  <delt0r> even now, CFD has been totally changed with them
2011-09-13T14:57:41  <mcstar> i dont know much about that
2011-09-13T14:57:47  <mcstar> we do PFT/PFC
2011-09-13T14:57:58  <delt0r> if we were all still stuck with FEM galkern methods... dam
2011-09-13T14:58:08  <delt0r> galkerin
2011-09-13T14:58:12  <delt0r> whatever
2011-09-13T14:58:12  <mcstar> galerkin
2011-09-13T14:58:15  <delt0r> thanks
2011-09-13T14:58:51  <delt0r> I don't think there is a single commercial CFD that uses that anymore
2011-09-13T14:58:58  <mcstar> theres a strong possibility that i not stying with physics
2011-09-13T14:59:06  <delt0r> well i left
2011-09-13T14:59:07  <mcstar> im*
2011-09-13T14:59:18  <delt0r> right now I am thinking of going back
2011-09-13T14:59:23  <delt0r> or to CS
2011-09-13T14:59:28  <mcstar> the thing is, that i need money pretty fast, maybe ill get a software job
2011-09-13T14:59:44  <delt0r> oh---well ... I had a few of those
2011-09-13T15:00:10  <delt0r> was making  more than my professors.
2011-09-13T15:00:22  <delt0r> I ended up drinking it all
2011-09-13T15:00:28  <mcstar> i dont have my degree yet, whats missing is only my thesis(in progress), what do you think, can i get a soft. developer job?
2011-09-13T15:00:39  <delt0r> No i LOVE academia
2011-09-13T15:00:53  <delt0r> Finish first
2011-09-13T15:00:59  <delt0r> It is only about finishing
2011-09-13T15:01:02  <mcstar> i need money
2011-09-13T15:01:44  * mcstar had a alcohol-free beer today
2011-09-13T15:01:46  <delt0r> yea-- i got a job while doing uni
2011-09-13T15:01:54  <delt0r> in fact i got 2
2011-09-13T15:02:22  <delt0r> that was a mistake --then i got married and ended with a (awesome) 8 year old daughter
2011-09-13T15:02:35  <delt0r> so well I am not a good example
2011-09-13T15:02:38  <mcstar> congrats
2011-09-13T15:02:49  <delt0r> that was 11 years a ago now
2011-09-13T15:02:54  <mcstar> all my collegues has daughters
2011-09-13T15:02:58  <mcstar> mostly 2
2011-09-13T15:03:31  <delt0r> but i can say i would hire you (i worked 10 years as a commercial coder )
2011-09-13T15:03:49  <delt0r> we stopped getting CS majors since they sucked
2011-09-13T15:04:03  <mcstar> and you still have hopes to get back into research?
2011-09-13T15:04:04  <delt0r> but you seem to know the theory and math as good as i do
2011-09-13T15:04:12  <delt0r> I am in research
2011-09-13T15:04:20  <delt0r> 2nd postdoc
2011-09-13T15:04:21  <mcstar> i mean physics
2011-09-13T15:04:26  <delt0r> oh yea...
2011-09-13T15:04:34  <delt0r> did my masters in physics
2011-09-13T15:04:43  <mcstar> yeah you told me
2011-09-13T15:04:46  <delt0r> PhD in computational bio
2011-09-13T15:04:55  <delt0r> never did a day of CS
2011-09-13T15:05:11  <delt0r> ok that is not quite true...
2011-09-13T15:05:14  <delt0r> but close
2011-09-13T15:05:30  <mcstar> what i can say, is that i can get up-to-date on subjects if needed
2011-09-13T15:05:50  <delt0r> we started to hire physics majors and math majors... they don't get marked on their comments in code... but on the fact the code works
2011-09-13T15:06:45  <delt0r> we had a bunch of CS majors giving us all kinds of BS about theory... but you think we could get a single peice of code out of them that worked?
2011-09-13T15:06:47  <mcstar> so are you the head of a team? do you manage finance too?
2011-09-13T15:06:51  <delt0r> not a chance
2011-09-13T15:07:07  <delt0r> Senior dev
2011-09-13T15:07:26  <delt0r> refused more promotions.. too much management... i like to cut code.
2011-09-13T15:07:32  <delt0r> I do it for holidays..
2011-09-13T15:07:35  <delt0r> :D
2011-09-13T15:07:38  <mcstar> may i ask what do you code exactly?
2011-09-13T15:07:48  <delt0r> My post doc is MSMS
2011-09-13T15:08:14  <mcstar> never heard of that acronym
2011-09-13T15:08:17  <delt0r> http://www.mabs.at/ewing/msms/index.shtml
2011-09-13T15:08:52  <delt0r> if you ping/host name me right now i think you get my first name too
2011-09-13T15:09:58  <mcstar> i using weechat, somehow i dont see the output of my pings
2011-09-13T15:10:02  <mcstar> im*
2011-09-13T15:11:12  <mcstar> i see, so this is some kind of population modeling?
2011-09-13T15:11:25  <delt0r> well i am on a static ip... you could get my desk phone number inside 30min without trying hard
2011-09-13T15:11:27  <delt0r> yea
2011-09-13T15:11:32  <delt0r> population genetics
2011-09-13T15:11:47  <delt0r> evolution of a finite population
2011-09-13T15:11:54  <delt0r> finite size population...

2011-09-13T15:23:10  <mcstar> if ill ever get close to java it will be because of clojure, which looks very promising

2011-09-13T15:24:26  <mcstar> it doesnt seem too horrible
2011-09-13T15:24:27  <delt0r> mind you i did do a bit of C/C++ and even some odd proprietary langs
2011-09-13T15:24:27  <delt0r> yea
2011-09-13T15:24:34  <delt0r> its nto
2011-09-13T15:24:35  <delt0r> not
2011-09-13T15:24:44  <delt0r> but it is not great either
2011-09-13T15:25:07  <delt0r> I love lisp and CLOS... but that is a love born of never really doing anything in ti
2011-09-13T15:25:08  <delt0r> it
2011-09-13T15:25:13  <mcstar> i took a look at the language benchmark shootout, or wth, java performs pretty well, and the code remains very clear
2011-09-13T15:25:30  <mcstar> take a look at the similar performing sbcl code, its horrible
2011-09-13T15:25:35  <delt0r> performance is in the hands of devloper more or less
2011-09-13T15:26:12  <delt0r> last time i tired sbcl... it would not compile on my machine...
2011-09-13T15:26:19  <mcstar> :S
2011-09-13T15:26:23  <delt0r> waiting for a JVM lisp to be finished
2011-09-13T15:26:26  <mcstar> and what kind of machine was that?

2011-09-13T15:27:08  <mcstar> hm
2011-09-13T15:27:20  <mcstar> i compiled it without problems
2011-09-13T15:27:24  <delt0r> can't remeber what was wrong... it was subtle..
2011-09-13T15:27:40  <delt0r> but lisp is ok i though with defines
2011-09-13T15:27:46  <delt0r> performance wise
2011-09-13T15:27:59  <mcstar> theres an error with sbcl packages for arch, it is compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer, and all the backtraces are broken
2011-09-13T15:28:02  <delt0r> and defines don't really clutter the code imo
2011-09-13T15:28:14  <delt0r> oh...
2011-09-13T15:28:34  <delt0r> what about PIC? don't you need omit frame pointer for that?
2011-09-13T15:28:40  <mcstar> now imagine that i learned lisp, without correct backtraces
2011-09-13T15:28:47  <delt0r> mm
2011-09-13T15:29:01  <delt0r> well debuging macros is always horrible imo

2011-09-13T15:30:24  <mcstar> the thing is, that from gcc 4.6 on the above setting is default
2011-09-13T15:30:53  <mcstar> and they the sblc guys changed the 1.50.1 i thin accordingly
2011-09-13T15:31:02  <delt0r> well yea.. you don't need the frame pointer... for the most part... debug symbols holds what you need right?
2011-09-13T15:31:04  <mcstar> but still, the new packages have the same error
2011-09-13T15:31:10  <mcstar> so i still compile it by hand
2011-09-13T15:31:36  <mcstar> i cant answer that without making something up
2011-09-13T15:31:49  <delt0r> well even java us is a little faster with -O
2011-09-13T15:32:02  <delt0r> which just level out trace infor
2011-09-13T15:32:08  <delt0r> information
2011-09-13T15:32:27  <mcstar> so, you dont consider clojure a mature lisp?
2011-09-13T15:32:43  <delt0r> its not clisp... but interesting non the less
2011-09-13T15:32:50  <mcstar> clisp?
2011-09-13T15:32:54  <mcstar> of course it isnt
2011-09-13T15:32:54  <delt0r> common
2011-09-13T15:33:00  <mcstar> ah thats cl
2011-09-13T15:33:11  <mcstar> they are vrey picky about the naming conventions
2011-09-13T15:33:11  <delt0r> right
2011-09-13T15:33:19  <mcstar> they differentiate between LISP and Lisp
2011-09-13T15:33:23  <mcstar> even
2011-09-13T15:33:59  <delt0r> tbh i am kind of tired of so many langs and yet in the *vast* majority if you want to something as normal as tcp sockets, you need different code for every OS
2011-09-13T15:34:17  <delt0r> it is lame that its not in a standard lib in 2010>

2011-09-13T15:35:09  <delt0r> however i don't think that changed in the end
2011-09-13T15:35:10  <mcstar> nono, clojure IS supported

2011-09-13T15:35:46  <mcstar> i mean the agent system, the asynchron agent/actor model that is inherently in clojure
2011-09-13T15:35:49  <delt0r> I want to use coroutines.

2011-09-13T15:37:54  <delt0r> if we end up on big maps, then many bots are going to time out if not coded smartly
2011-09-13T15:38:06  <mcstar> yeah, been there
2011-09-13T15:38:11  <delt0r> all the demo bots time out on 100x100 maps for me
2011-09-13T15:38:18  <mcstar> my fsm snake bot was sometimes really slow
2011-09-13T15:38:28  <delt0r> well phython demo bots
2011-09-13T15:38:38  <delt0r> fsm? slow?
2011-09-13T15:38:46  <mcstar> yeah
2011-09-13T15:38:52  <mcstar> i used a recursive resolver
2011-09-13T15:39:07  <mcstar> i kept looping while the system reached a fixed-point
2011-09-13T15:39:23  <delt0r> still would not have expected it to be slow... recursive is not necessarily slow
2011-09-13T15:39:25  <delt0r> ah ic
2011-09-13T15:39:26  <mcstar> i performed better than stocha's snake bot
2011-09-13T15:39:31  <mcstar> it*
2011-09-13T15:39:50  <mcstar> the logic is, the code was iterative
2011-09-13T15:40:13  <mcstar> all in all it was slow with many ants but not just because of this
2011-09-13T15:40:22  <mcstar> it has a perfect matching algorithm
2011-09-13T15:40:37  <mcstar> and sometimes it needed to compute 50x100 matrix or some like that
2011-09-13T15:40:37  <delt0r> well my current ideas don't scale with ants but map size
2011-09-13T15:40:59  <delt0r> in fact one idea gets faster with more ants!
2011-09-13T15:41:18  <mcstar> look, i wrote last week, in circa 2 days a bot, which performs rather well, its VERY simple
2011-09-13T15:41:29  <mcstar> i spent much much mcuh less time tha non the previous one
2011-09-13T15:41:33  <mcstar> and its way better
2011-09-13T15:41:47  <delt0r> i don't know if the current beta server is a good reflection of the final standard
2011-09-13T15:41:53  <delt0r> but yea
2011-09-13T15:42:00  <mcstar> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/rankings.php
2011-09-13T15:42:05  <mcstar> look, there i am
2011-09-13T15:42:14  <delt0r> Mc whatevers bot was not that complicated IMO
2011-09-13T15:42:32  <mcstar> mine isnt called that mc*
2011-09-13T15:42:55  <delt0r> from the last comp
2011-09-13T15:42:58  <mcstar> find it for yourself, i dont want to advertise myself :)
2011-09-13T15:43:05  <mcstar> i wasnt there the last time
2011-09-13T15:43:46  <mcstar> what alg. gets faster with the number of ants?
2011-09-13T15:44:35  <mcstar> the Fog Of War Baysian Fortune Teller?
2011-09-13T15:44:39  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-13T15:45:11  <delt0r> one that looks at non intersecting paths
2011-09-13T15:45:11  <Zannick> the "oh god there are so many ants just issue random orders" algorithm
2011-09-13T15:45:25  <delt0r> more ants the less you need to look forward
2011-09-13T15:46:01  <mcstar> Zannick: not true, that too must monotonically increase
2011-09-13T15:46:04  <delt0r> Zannick: it looks like a lot of bots currently do that... why i question the competitiveness of the current server
2011-09-13T15:46:43  <mcstar> delt0r: cut the rankings above ~30%
2011-09-13T15:46:58  <mcstar> there are many starter kits uploaded
2011-09-13T15:47:05  <delt0r> always is
2011-09-13T15:47:19  <mcstar> i argued at one point, that they should not have provided starter kits
2011-09-13T15:47:35  <delt0r> there was talk of making sure they didn't swamp the games played this time round... did that happen
2011-09-13T15:47:49  <mcstar> the ones who would wrote those things for themselves, would probably upload a half-decent bot too
2011-09-13T15:48:00  <mcstar> write*
2011-09-13T15:48:33  <delt0r> one of the goals is too be very accessible to even high school level students
2011-09-13T15:48:39  <delt0r> so they are needed
2011-09-13T15:49:14  <delt0r> but if the are the default and not changed... then i don't think they should get the same priority for games
2011-09-13T15:49:19  <mcstar> but i guess a big portion of the beta workers' cycles are spent on aimless battles
2011-09-13T15:49:45  <delt0r> Personally we have had some hard core wet behind the ears coders here. It was cool
2011-09-13T15:50:06  <mcstar> 658 users that pretty much for beta i think
2011-09-13T15:50:14  <delt0r> it is
2011-09-13T15:50:31  <delt0r> considering how small tron was compared to planet wars
2011-09-13T15:50:34  <mcstar> translation pls
2011-09-13T15:50:44  <delt0r> ?

2011-09-13T23:04:58  <mleise> McLeopold: It looks like you finally arrived at some nice-to-have features. Does that mean we are close to a launch?
2011-09-13T23:20:24  <McLeopold> mleise: hopfully
2011-09-13T23:20:54  <McLeopold> I'm working on a trueskill implementation that won't crash.
2011-09-13T23:21:02  <McLeopold> Then we need to beef up worker stability.
2011-09-13T23:21:13  <McLeopold> I think everything else can wait.
2011-09-13T23:21:14  <mleise> So the TruSkill implementation is crashing the workers?
2011-09-13T23:21:34  <McLeopold> no, it is just crashing on the main server, janzert created a script to restart it
2011-09-13T23:21:57  <mleise> weird. out-of-memory?
2011-09-13T23:21:58  <McLeopold> not often, just enough to be anoying
2011-09-13T23:22:06  <McLeopold> probably, it is java
2011-09-13T23:22:11  <McLeopold> and the test server sucks
2011-09-13T23:22:49  <mleise> That OpenVZ has 'burst-ram' which will be reclaimed by the VM as neccessary. Any application working in that memory may crash randomly
2011-09-13T23:22:50  <McLeopold> oh, the last big thing to do, rewrite all of the web page material
2011-09-13T23:23:26  <mleise> I thought the beta site was pretty much complete and up to date except for maybe 2 pages
2011-09-13T23:23:42  <McLeopold> no, click around, it's worse than you think
2011-09-13T23:23:54  <mleise> ok, will do :)
2011-09-13T23:24:50  <McLeopold> starting_your_own.php
2011-09-13T23:25:05  <McLeopold> simple_strategy_guide.php
2011-09-13T23:25:20  <McLeopold> advanced strategy guide
2011-09-13T23:25:24  <McLeopold> .php
2011-09-13T23:25:58  <mleise> oh... and what about the Unicode problems?
2011-09-13T23:26:20  <McLeopold> I think I got those fixed, but there still might be some bad data in the database
2011-09-13T23:26:38  <McLeopold> it needs to be tested more
2011-09-13T23:26:57  <McLeopold> I need a routing to cleanup messed up utf-8
2011-09-13T23:27:01  <McLeopold> routine
2011-09-13T23:27:16  <mleise> There is. I see some organizations with broken characters, and some that 'hacked' around the problem using 'a' instead of 'Ã¤' for example
2011-09-13T23:27:31  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-09-13T23:27:50  <McLeopold> We could do a wipe and let everyone re-register and create new orgs
2011-09-13T23:27:50  <mleise> Will the database be cleaned on the real server?
2011-09-13T23:27:55  <mleise> ok
2011-09-13T23:28:04  <McLeopold> maybe, amstan and janzert have to agree
2011-09-13T23:28:11  <McLeopold> I think it would be worth it
2011-09-13T23:28:41  <amstan> sure, as long as the website uses it properly
2011-09-13T23:29:04  <amstan> last few terms i was setting the db just fine, but the website did not have an encoding specified
2011-09-13T23:29:25  <amstan> so i had to remove all the special chars so they wouldn't be squigly lines
2011-09-13T23:29:28  <amstan> chars*
2011-09-13T23:29:36  <McLeopold> how can I check that? we should just use utf-8
2011-09-13T23:29:41  <mleise> There are also probably some orphan oranization names, but I'm not sure (i.e. spelled wrong, corrected in profile later)
2011-09-13T23:29:45  <amstan> it should be in the header file
2011-09-13T23:29:48  <McLeopold> mysql seems to store as utf-8
2011-09-13T23:30:57  <McLeopold> amstan: I'm using php's htmlentities( , , "UTF-8") on all usernames and organizations, plus the bios.
2011-09-13T23:31:12  <McLeopold> I think that should be sufficiant for what we need.
2011-09-13T23:31:17  <amstan> why is that required?
2011-09-13T23:31:33  <McLeopold> to translate utf-8 into html entities
2011-09-13T23:31:33  <amstan> shouldn't utf8 in the source code display fine in the rendering?
2011-09-13T23:31:42  <amstan> as long as the charset is defined properly in <head>?
2011-09-13T23:32:00  <McLeopold> uh..
2011-09-13T23:32:30  <McLeopold> it didn't
2011-09-13T23:32:54  <amstan> it didn't last contest because i suspect there was nothing in head
2011-09-13T23:33:03  <amstan> but if it works, nvm
2011-09-13T23:33:07  <mleise> It does in the visualizer
2011-09-13T23:33:21  <McLeopold> well, it didn't 5 days ago, but when I did the html entities, it looked alot better
2011-09-13T23:33:48  <amstan> yeah, we have this already
2011-09-13T23:33:49  <amstan> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
2011-09-13T23:33:51  <amstan> hmm
2011-09-13T23:34:26  <McLeopold> so it was in the head, but looking bad, because we are already sending database text through htmlentities, which screws it up unless you specify the "UTF-8" options
2011-09-13T23:34:40  <McLeopold> so, regular text was fine, database stuff was wrong
2011-09-13T23:34:47  <amstan> oh, i get it
2011-09-13T23:34:57  <amstan> so it was php's fault then
2011-09-13T23:35:00  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-09-13T23:35:14  <amstan> ok, fair enough
2011-09-13T23:35:25  <mleise> "If your organization isn't present in drowdown, select 'Other' and enter your organization." <- find the error
2011-09-13T23:35:27  <amstan> yeah, so when we launch we can clear the db
2011-09-13T23:35:30  <McLeopold> I couldn't probably set it globaly in the ini file
2011-09-13T23:35:41  <amstan> McLeopold: how are we going to solve duplicates though?
2011-09-13T23:35:58  <McLeopold> by hand?
2011-09-13T23:36:06  <amstan> i guess that works
2011-09-13T23:36:10  <amstan> just wait for forum posts
2011-09-13T23:36:35  <McLeopold> there is no other way, I don't want to build in a levenstien distance and ask "do you mean this?"
2011-09-13T23:36:42  <amstan> ya
2011-09-13T23:37:01  <mleise> but it is the latest shit in the IT world :)
2011-09-13T23:37:18  <McLeopold> maybe there is already a jQuery plugin...
2011-09-13T23:37:19  <mleise> Even D does that.
2011-09-13T23:37:32  <amstan> maybe we can have that when we get django
2011-09-13T23:37:38  <mleise> MIT -> Massachu.... will be difficult though ^^
2011-09-13T23:38:24  <McLeopold> dang, it sounds fun to implement and now I want it...
2011-09-13T23:38:59  <amstan> McLeopold: lol, nobody's stopping you
2011-09-13T23:39:17  <McLeopold> amstan: so, I'm furiously working on backend issues.  If you can get the remaining web pages, including the front page, ready for launch, we can launch.
2011-09-13T23:39:23  <amstan> k
2011-09-13T23:39:30  <mleise> don't do it! :) What if I am the first user and register 'University fo Waterloo' and everyone else gets this as first proposal
2011-09-13T23:39:54  <McLeopold> I'll allow the next guy to correct it for everyone?
2011-09-13T23:40:07  <mleise> yes... but that is even more work for you
2011-09-13T23:40:11  <amstan> McLeopold: what about trolls?
2011-09-13T23:40:16  <McLeopold> "Uizzle fo' Wizzle"?
2011-09-13T23:41:13  <mleise> Corrections should go into a database for the authorities to check
2011-09-13T23:41:21  <McLeopold> yeah, suggested edits
2011-09-13T23:42:52  <mleise> Anyway, people who troll on their own organization should be few. I can't imagine anyone changing Microsoft to Micro$oft
2011-09-13T23:43:12  <McLeopold> mleise: I don't think you understand what a troll is
2011-09-13T23:43:26  <mleise> hmm
2011-09-13T23:43:26  <amstan> lol, yes
2011-09-13T23:43:34  <McLeopold> grifers don't follow rules, like, must work at org to troll them
2011-09-13T23:43:39  <McLeopold> griefers
2011-09-13T23:44:04  <mleise> I have difficulties to think like a troll
2011-09-13T23:44:46  <McLeopold> ok, back to trueskill...
