2011-01-16T06:04:17  <antimatroid1> i am still setting everything up
2011-01-16T06:04:19  <antimatroid1> http://i.imgur.com/Z8UPO.png
2011-01-16T06:04:33  <antimatroid1> the move algorithm works, but it doesn't make any intuitive sense
2011-01-16T06:05:55  <dr-> do you understand which linear path a snowball gets when you throw it if not horyzontal or vertical ?
2011-01-16T06:06:10  <antimatroid1> dr-: http://codepad.org/2QCb1qMp that's my map gen, you will find 5 maps at the bottom and you need to uncomment lines 204-206 to have them save to files in the directory you run it from
2011-01-16T06:06:24  <dr-> okay, thanks antimatroid1 :)
2011-01-16T06:06:44  <antimatroid1> read the linear interpolation part, it gives you functions for working out what square an object will be in at each step between moves
2011-01-16T06:07:05  <antimatroid1> as well as the height of a snowball as it moves
2011-01-16T06:07:44  <antimatroid1> i really hate the move cancellation, you can swap squares, but not through an empty middle one, and all sorts of other weird things that are just unintuitive
2011-01-16T06:07:54  <dr-> okay, i read it but found it confusing
2011-01-16T06:08:08  <antimatroid1> it makes more sense once you have done some programming
2011-01-16T06:08:34  <antimatroid1> i've got 11 files already, and my bot is just walking around
2011-01-16T06:08:38  <dr-> did you consider the 10% limit for trees in your generator ?
2011-01-16T06:08:54  <antimatroid1> yes, 0.1*31*31 = 96.something
2011-01-16T06:09:05  <dr-> yep, i just see it, sorry
2011-01-16T06:09:11  <antimatroid1> all good :)
2011-01-16T06:11:57  <antimatroid1> i've sort of worked out how to do move selection and a decision/game tree depending on whether i can see any of their kids
2011-01-16T06:12:02  <antimatroid1> i just need to get all the messy stuff programmed
2011-01-16T06:12:09  <antimatroid1> then just play around with evaluation
2011-01-16T06:13:11  <dr-> same for me, i think the strategy is clear in my head
2011-01-16T06:13:42  <dr-> will you use the catch action ?
2011-01-16T06:14:04  <antimatroid1> doubtful
2011-01-16T06:14:13  <antimatroid1> actually, yes probably
2011-01-16T06:14:22  <dr-> that's true, it's useful to share small snowball between our children
2011-01-16T06:14:30  <dr-> just to spare time
2011-01-16T06:14:38  <antimatroid1> yeah, or if you think they're going to hit you, might be worth trying to catch
2011-01-16T06:15:09  <antimatroid1> i'm going to do a pretty wide tree when children can see each other
2011-01-16T06:15:32  <antimatroid1> then a much deeper kind of decision tree at other points
2011-01-16T06:16:58  <dr-> at the moment, i improve my donothing strategy :D
2011-01-16T06:17:47  <antimatroid1> i pretty much need to rewrite their engine to get my tree going though
2011-01-16T06:17:50  <antimatroid1> so that will take a while
2011-01-16T06:18:01  <antimatroid1> i may get impatient and write a quick heuristicy bot at some point
2011-01-16T06:19:40  <dr-> otherwise, what's up with your ant game antimatroid1 ?
2011-01-16T06:20:01  <antimatroid1> doesn't look like my variation will be used, so it's mostly dead
2011-01-16T06:20:11  <antimatroid1> i'm fairly uninterested in the ant game they've got going atm
2011-01-16T06:20:39  <antimatroid1> i still think they should use a variation of frontiers visualiser though, that was awesome
2011-01-16T06:20:54  <dr-> yours is good, that's true
2011-01-16T06:21:34  <dr-> the one they show isn't a ant game but a zombie game i think
2011-01-16T06:21:40  <antimatroid1> the current one is sort of get grains and multiply, i don't think there's even much strategy wise to the fighting
2011-01-16T06:21:53  <dr-> yep i saw that
2011-01-16T06:22:08  <antimatroid1> i made mine with strategy in mind, and really liked the home base invasion/defense part, which was my main objective
2011-01-16T06:22:16  <antimatroid1> hence the two games are fairly different
2011-01-16T06:22:40  <sigh> zombie ants want to eat your GRAAAAINS
2011-01-16T06:22:59  <antimatroid1> one of the better random calls :P
2011-01-16T06:26:58  <dr-> have to go, see ya ;)

2011-01-16T07:03:05  <Frontier> to be honest I liked it more then walls were blocking sight and we were contemplating one process per ant with actual communication between te ants through color signals, scents or something like that.
2011-01-16T07:04:13  <Frontier> We miss a real killer game idea for next term. Something addictive like Minecraft.
2011-01-16T07:06:17  <Frontier> It has few rules, but creates a lot of possibilities.
2011-01-16T07:11:04  <Frontier> We always think of games with grids or production rates. Maybe we should have looked at HaxBall http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGsDEizkXJU a little closer.

2011-01-16T07:53:22  <antimatroid1> i quite like snowballs game
2011-01-16T07:53:35  <antimatroid1> the strategy space is huge at least
2011-01-16T07:53:35  <delt0r_> dr-: I don't know
2011-01-16T07:54:14  <antimatroid1> and the game mechanics aren't entirely trivial, particularly with throwing snow
2011-01-16T07:55:14  <delt0r_> dr-: its this group http://evol.bio.lmu.de/index.html
2011-01-16T07:55:26  <delt0r_> can't find a more specfic link right now
2011-01-16T07:55:55  <delt0r_> they are modeling slave maker ants. They live in acorns in the US

2011-01-16T08:00:10  <dr-> delt0r_: thanks, i'll check this out

2011-01-16T08:01:10  <antimatroid1> but i doubt it'll get in for the next contest
2011-01-16T08:01:56  <delt0r_> I think the stratego is the best idea so far
2011-01-16T08:01:59  <delt0r_> nice
2011-01-16T08:02:00  <delt0r_> simple
2011-01-16T08:02:05  <delt0r_> complicated
2011-01-16T08:02:08  <delt0r_> fun
2011-01-16T08:02:14  <delt0r_> and easy to code for a engine
2011-01-16T08:02:31  <delt0r_> Mine is pretty difficult for the engine
2011-01-16T08:02:45  <delt0r_> unless you know your complex math properly
2011-01-16T08:03:27  <delt0r_> In fact even if my idea was finished... i would still vote for that
2011-01-16T08:04:36  <antimatroid1> stratego is flags yeah?
2011-01-16T08:04:56  <antimatroid1> my ants invasion could potentially have been seen like that, but you just had to "claim their flag" to win
2011-01-16T08:05:54  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: yea... the American name for the game i think. It was originally dutch as i understand
2011-01-16T08:06:28  <delt0r_> ant have complicated moves. stratego does not..
2011-01-16T08:06:38  <delt0r_> ie everything but how to win is simple
2011-01-16T08:07:03  <antimatroid1> ants was pretty basic at every step
2011-01-16T08:07:07  <antimatroid1> my ants*
2011-01-16T08:07:31  <antimatroid1> compared to this snowballs game, writing a bot would have been a walk in the park
2011-01-16T08:09:18  <dr-> i agree, snowballs game : 10 differents moves whereas ants games still have less moves
2011-01-16T08:10:12  <antimatroid1> 10 different moves? where did you get that?
2011-01-16T08:10:15  <delt0r_> mmm

2011-01-16T08:10:55  <antimatroid1> flags :P

2011-01-16T08:56:53  <delt0r_> well it 10C here... so the snow is melting.... not what i want
2011-01-16T08:56:55  <antimatroid1> it's summer here

2011-01-16T08:57:16  <rabidus> yesterday was something .. -25
2011-01-16T08:57:20  <antimatroid1> yet australia has hardly any bushfires and plenty of floods
2011-01-16T08:57:24  <antimatroid1> not the typical summer
2011-01-16T08:57:30  <delt0r_> yes it is
2011-01-16T08:57:41  <delt0r_> you guys have floods every second year
2011-01-16T08:57:53  <delt0r_> for at least as long as i can remeber
2011-01-16T08:57:59  <antimatroid1> we usually get some pretty bad bushfires during the summer
2011-01-16T08:58:28  <antimatroid1> i live nowhere near the bush though, so i'm all good

2011-01-16T11:22:29  <jmcarthur> i'm also beginning to lean away from the tron game in favor of stratego. i'm finding that the line of sight stuff is quite involved. the efficient ways to do it are too complicated for a specification. without the line of sight stuff i think the game loses some appeal. simple range-based fog of war doesn't really cut it
2011-01-16T11:22:59  <delt0r_> I just really like stratego
2011-01-16T11:23:17  <delt0r_> and given time frames... if a feb/march date is the target
2011-01-16T11:23:38  <delt0r_> I think its more realistic that some games that really need a bit more trashing out
2011-01-16T11:24:00  <delt0r_> in fact I was looking for the board game here...
2011-01-16T11:24:20  <jmcarthur> are you thinking simultaneous move-all-units or simultaneous move-one-unit?
2011-01-16T11:24:38  <jmcarthur> heh yeah, i've played a few games with my wife since i thought of using a variation of it for the contest
2011-01-16T11:24:57  <jmcarthur> *move-one-unit-each
2011-01-16T11:25:02  <jmcarthur> i think i still like the former
2011-01-16T11:25:08  <jmcarthur> i'm less certain about fog of war
2011-01-16T11:25:47  <delt0r_> I would have the same as the board game regarding FOG
2011-01-16T11:25:55  <jmcarthur> the strategy space is already huge, and there's already hidden information
2011-01-16T11:26:00  <jmcarthur> so... none?
2011-01-16T11:26:00  <delt0r_> you only know what something is when you attack...
2011-01-16T11:26:09  <delt0r_> its up to the bot to keep track
2011-01-16T11:26:11  <jmcarthur> oh you are calling that fog of war

2011-01-16T11:26:34  <delt0r_> well you don't get to see what things are right.. till attacked?
2011-01-16T11:26:38  <jmcarthur> i was talking about knowing *where* units are only when in sight range, as in the traditional RTS sense
2011-01-16T11:26:49  <delt0r_> Oh hasbro has a different version out? with a dragon
2011-01-16T11:26:51  <jmcarthur> and then only knowing *what* they are when fighting
2011-01-16T11:26:59  <jmcarthur> yeah they do. i haven't seen it anywhere
2011-01-16T11:27:08  <delt0r_> oh ic
2011-01-16T11:27:30  <jmcarthur> that way if you lose sight of a unit after fighting it, you might not be able to associate its unit type with it again later
2011-01-16T11:27:33  <jmcarthur> might make it too hard
2011-01-16T11:27:36  <delt0r_> Don't know about that... would tend to stick closely to the board game... as it has pretty good balance
2011-01-16T11:27:41  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-16T11:27:48  <jmcarthur> another thing though
2011-01-16T11:28:18  <jmcarthur> if you have full vision, it is very easy to see what's not moving. the bots might have to avoid moving a *lot* of their units just to not give away the bombs and flag
2011-01-16T11:28:29  <jmcarthur> since this is move-everything-at-once
2011-01-16T11:28:30  <delt0r_> yea
2011-01-16T11:28:39  <delt0r_> thats the point of stratego
2011-01-16T11:28:47  <jmcarthur> yeah, but normally you only move one thing at a time
2011-01-16T11:28:54  <jmcarthur> so it's harder to see what's not moving
2011-01-16T11:29:06  <delt0r_> well I guess one unit per turn is ok too
2011-01-16T11:29:29  <delt0r_> I would do either all units can only move on square... and more than one unit can move in a turn
2011-01-16T11:29:50  <delt0r_> or let units have different movement as per stratego
2011-01-16T11:29:56  <delt0r_> and only one per turn
2011-01-16T11:30:04  <jmcarthur> i think i prefer the former still
2011-01-16T11:30:05  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-208-118.dynamic.chello.pl> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2011-01-16T11:30:38  <delt0r_> "attacks" would need to be resolved with simultaneous movement.. not sure how that works with things like scouts
2011-01-16T11:31:02  <delt0r_> the only problem is that some units are usefull because of their movement... ie scouts
2011-01-16T11:31:29  <jmcarthur> in my code, i just have it to where moving onto the same tile is an attack, and also if two units are moving into each other it's an attack where the winner moves onto the loser's old position
2011-01-16T11:31:38  <jmcarthur> scouts are useful for other reasons too
2011-01-16T11:31:46  <jmcarthur> they are basically fodder for feeling things out
2011-01-16T11:31:54  <jmcarthur> their movement is just bonus
2011-01-16T11:32:37  <jmcarthur> i've also been assuming that it's simply illegal for a bot to send two of its own units to the same position
2011-01-16T11:32:38  <delt0r_> their movement is/was very important
2011-01-16T11:32:50  <delt0r_> scouts that is
2011-01-16T11:32:59  <jmcarthur> sure. i'm just saying i don't think it's the end of the world if they are weakened a bit
2011-01-16T11:33:04  <delt0r_> keep one till end game was a big deal IIRC
2011-01-16T11:33:16  <jmcarthur> it would really simplify the game if they moved the same as everything else
2011-01-16T11:33:23  <delt0r_> this is where i think its easy to break the ballance...
2011-01-16T11:33:25  <jmcarthur> heck, the new stratego has tons of new rules :\
2011-01-16T11:33:26  <delt0r_> ballance is hard
2011-01-16T11:33:49  <jmcarthur> i've played games of stratego where neither player moved their scouts more then on square
2011-01-16T11:34:05  <jmcarthur> officially you can't attack and move at the same time anyway. only in variations can you do that
2011-01-16T11:34:23  <jmcarthur> with scouts' special movement i mean
2011-01-16T11:35:24  <jmcarthur> also officially when a unit attacks abother, both players get to learn something, but there are also interesting variations where the one being attacked only has to reveal the unit if the unit is dying anyway, but the attacker still has to reveal
2011-01-16T11:35:28  <jmcarthur> *another
2011-01-16T11:35:54  <jmcarthur> the latter makes scouts far less useful
2011-01-16T11:36:18  <jmcarthur> except as fodder... and if they move more than one square there's no incentive to attack them at all
2011-01-16T11:36:40  <jmcarthur> anyway, i'm just saying there are lots of challenging variations and i don't think breaking scouts breaks the game
2011-01-16T11:36:44  <delt0r_> the rule set i played
2011-01-16T11:37:02  <delt0r_> was that both attacked and attacker had to be "revealed"
2011-01-16T11:37:12  <jmcarthur> yes, that's the "official" rules
2011-01-16T11:37:16  <delt0r_> scouts couldn't attack unless adjcent
2011-01-16T11:37:32  <jmcarthur> but i had a set that also suggested the variant i meantioned, too
2011-01-16T11:37:37  <jmcarthur> *mentioned
2011-01-16T11:38:14  <jmcarthur> with simultaneous movement, the first think i would do if i saw a unit do a scout-movement is move away from the scout so it can't reveal anything
2011-01-16T11:38:17  <jmcarthur> *thing
2011-01-16T11:38:19  <delt0r_> well I think that keeping as close, while make turns simultaneous.. would be the best idea
2011-01-16T11:38:27  <jmcarthur> okay, i'll start checking my typing before i hit enter now :)
2011-01-16T11:38:42  <Blkt> talking about next AI challenge?
2011-01-16T11:38:51  <delt0r_> and i would favour the one unit per turn
2011-01-16T11:39:03  <jmcarthur> ah, then that's different
2011-01-16T11:39:24  <jmcarthur> i just don't want to be *too* much like the board game
2011-01-16T11:39:47  <delt0r_> well simulationus turns its a pretty big difference
2011-01-16T11:39:57  <delt0r_> but yea
2011-01-16T11:40:04  <delt0r_> there is the copyright thing
2011-01-16T11:40:20  <jmcarthur> well, it's hard to claim copyright on gameplay
2011-01-16T11:40:27  <Blkt> good evening people
2011-01-16T11:40:35  <delt0r_> lawyers get paid by the hour
2011-01-16T11:40:41  <delt0r_> not for good advice
2011-01-16T11:41:14  <jmcarthur> so move-all-units then? ;)
2011-01-16T11:41:31  <delt0r_> well its your idea... i am happy enough either way
2011-01-16T11:42:01  <delt0r_> if its all units move... then i would perhaps even change the units... perhaps drop scouts...
2011-01-16T11:42:04  <delt0r_> or something
2011-01-16T11:42:34  <delt0r_> keep a miner, spy, marshell and flag
2011-01-16T11:42:34  <jmcarthur> without scouts the lowest ranking unit is miners, which kind of sucks because you need to hold on to them
2011-01-16T11:42:47  <delt0r_> yea i guess
2011-01-16T11:42:47  <jmcarthur> i assume you also mean keep bombs
2011-01-16T11:42:52  <delt0r_> yes
2011-01-16T11:43:17  <delt0r_> bombs are awesome when a Marshal finds one
2011-01-16T11:43:44  <delt0r_> and a scout that never moves just became a taboo unit
2011-01-16T11:43:55  <jmcarthur> i'm afraid of having too few unit types because then there's really just not much point in having micro and shuffling things around so that the fights are optimal, and the guessing game is a lot easier
2011-01-16T11:44:22  <delt0r_> this is why i would favour one unit per turn...
2011-01-16T11:44:27  <delt0r_> keep the turns short
2011-01-16T11:44:32  <delt0r_> ie .2 sec
2011-01-16T11:44:35  <delt0r_> or something
2011-01-16T11:44:36  <jmcarthur> miner/spy/marshall would be rock/paper/scissors, except for the bomb thing
2011-01-16T11:44:58  <delt0r_> Na.. you are right... just keep the units as is
2011-01-16T11:45:51  <jmcarthur> we could theme it after ants
2011-01-16T11:45:55  <jmcarthur> or something
2011-01-16T11:46:17  <delt0r_> Zombies
2011-01-16T11:46:20  <jmcarthur> anything but what stratego does
2011-01-16T11:46:31  <delt0r_> ninja zombies
2011-01-16T11:46:34  <delt0r_> and unicorns
2011-01-16T11:46:40  <jmcarthur> blind people
2011-01-16T11:46:44  <delt0r_> fluffy unicorns
2011-01-16T11:47:06  <delt0r_> so a zombie is a bomb...
2011-01-16T11:47:10  <delt0r_> ie does not move.
2011-01-16T11:47:24  <delt0r_> but kill pretty much anything
2011-01-16T11:47:44  <jmcarthur> except for the redneck
2011-01-16T11:47:47  <delt0r_> i am only half joking
2011-01-16T11:47:59  <delt0r_> redneck == zombie
2011-01-16T11:48:08  <jmcarthur> rednecks are the miners
2011-01-16T11:48:13  <delt0r_> lol
2011-01-16T11:48:19  <jmcarthur> they carry around shotguns and kill zombies
2011-01-16T11:48:24  <delt0r_> I was going to go for buffys
2011-01-16T11:48:37  <jmcarthur> i'm running with the zombie scenario
2011-01-16T11:48:43  <jmcarthur> the marshal is the town mayor
2011-01-16T11:48:56  <jmcarthur> this makes no sense
2011-01-16T11:48:57  <delt0r_> I think the marshal should be Alice...
2011-01-16T11:49:04  <jmcarthur> why are two towns fighting during a zombie apocalypse?
2011-01-16T11:49:14  <delt0r_> why not
2011-01-16T11:49:26  <delt0r_> zombies don't need a reason
2011-01-16T11:49:30  <jmcarthur> the virus that made the zombies drove them crazy
2011-01-16T11:49:32  <jmcarthur> that's it
2011-01-16T11:49:55  <delt0r_> Alice from resident evil is a Marshal
2011-01-16T11:50:09  <delt0r_> the flag? mm. perhaps that can be the cure
2011-01-16T11:50:43  <delt0r_> scouts are normal citizens...
2011-01-16T11:51:08  <delt0r_> well anyway... on  a more serious note
2011-01-16T11:51:27  <delt0r_> I would think given time frames etc.. this is perhaps the best idea.
2011-01-16T11:51:34  <delt0r_> the only thing left is maps
2011-01-16T11:51:50  <delt0r_> do we have a fixed map... or not... or even really big maps

2011-01-16T11:52:11  <jmcarthur> simultaneous movement begs for that
2011-01-16T11:52:23  <jmcarthur> the hard part here is unit placement
2011-01-16T11:52:28  <delt0r_> yea
2011-01-16T11:52:42  <delt0r_> so give 10 sec or something for unit placement...
2011-01-16T11:52:59  <delt0r_> fixed "starting" grid
2011-01-16T11:53:32  <delt0r_> rather than a over sized starting zone that you don't even have to fully occupy?
2011-01-16T11:53:42  <jmcarthur> i would say that the maps should all be top vs. bottom, and the bot always sees himself as playing the bottom, and the bot knows that he should always just place his units on the bottom half or so of the map
2011-01-16T11:53:56  <delt0r_> sounds good
2011-01-16T11:54:09  <delt0r_> I would not have any fog of war
2011-01-16T11:54:16  <jmcarthur> yeah i think it's unnecessary
2011-01-16T11:54:17  <delt0r_> so you see units.
2011-01-16T11:54:23  <delt0r_> just not what they are
2011-01-16T11:54:25  <jmcarthur> bots will just have to move fewer units than possible
2011-01-16T11:54:30  <jmcarthur> to hide things
2011-01-16T11:54:35  <delt0r_> indeed
2011-01-16T11:54:51  <delt0r_> lakes or obstructions in the map?
2011-01-16T11:54:55  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-01-16T11:55:02  <delt0r_> fixed/random?
2011-01-16T11:55:05  <jmcarthur> i'd just say the same sort of thing as the walls in the last tron game
2011-01-16T11:55:17  <delt0r_> so random
2011-01-16T11:55:22  <jmcarthur> fixed/pregenerated is probably best
2011-01-16T11:55:26  <jmcarthur> not new for each game
2011-01-16T11:55:30  <delt0r_> oh
2011-01-16T11:55:36  <jmcarthur> disagree?
2011-01-16T11:55:36  <delt0r_> k
2011-01-16T11:55:41  <delt0r_> i like random
2011-01-16T11:55:49  <jmcarthur> i'm rather indifferent
2011-01-16T11:55:51  <delt0r_> did quantum physics
2011-01-16T11:55:54  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-01-16T11:56:04  <delt0r_> random and prime numbers are cool
2011-01-16T11:56:12  <jmcarthur> random is fine. but i want to at least be able to feed fixed maps to the engine
2011-01-16T11:56:20  <delt0r_> yes
2011-01-16T11:56:24  <delt0r_> of course
2011-01-16T11:56:43  <jmcarthur> and so we might be best off with our normal architecture of engine + map generator
2011-01-16T11:56:52  <jmcarthur> and we could just tie them together for tournaments
2011-01-16T11:56:58  <delt0r_> I would have the obstructions only distributed in the center of the map
2011-01-16T11:57:02  <jmcarthur> if we want randomness
2011-01-16T11:57:22  <delt0r_> yes... completely agree
2011-01-16T11:57:30  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't. i think obstructions that hinder movement might lead to some interesting placement strategies
2011-01-16T11:57:42  <delt0r_> yea...
2011-01-16T11:57:43  <jmcarthur> as long as there are no closed areas

2011-01-16T11:58:49  <delt0r_> again--easy to do
2011-01-16T11:59:13  <delt0r_> but if 2 units are next to each other... both move "past" --what happens?
2011-01-16T11:59:18  <delt0r_> ie
2011-01-16T11:59:39  <jmcarthur> in my code they fight and the winner moves to the loser's old position
2011-01-16T11:59:53  <jmcarthur> units in that scenario fight before all other fights
2011-01-16T12:00:02  <jmcarthur> brb
2011-01-16T12:00:06  <delt0r_> right...and since there are no diag moves... thats the only case to consider

2011-01-16T12:06:19  <jmcarthur> i had already decided i wasn't liking the direction of this tron game due to the complexity
2011-01-16T12:06:36  <delt0r_> and what do you think of ants? (I am not a fan)
2011-01-16T12:06:47  <jmcarthur> it would suck to have to describe a symmetric field of view algorithm in the specification

2011-01-16T12:07:13  <jmcarthur> there are ideas for it that i like, but i'm not sure if they would add enough

2011-01-16T12:11:04  <jmcarthur> not even very good type-driven development

2011-01-16T12:11:22  <delt0r_> of course
2011-01-16T12:11:25  <jmcarthur> :D
2011-01-16T12:11:27  <delt0r_> Well i would use java
2011-01-16T12:11:45  <delt0r_> since lisp is still not viable for me as a day job lang
2011-01-16T12:12:08  <jmcarthur> you're treating this like a day job? :P
2011-01-16T12:12:13  <delt0r_> no
2011-01-16T12:12:22  <delt0r_> but since i am all set up to use java
2011-01-16T12:12:26  <delt0r_> do a lot of java
2011-01-16T12:12:33  <delt0r_> and know java pretty well
2011-01-16T12:12:53  <delt0r_> it is easyer to just use java for something so small
2011-01-16T12:13:11  <delt0r_> I really like CLOS etc... but i don't really know them... and haven't used it much
2011-01-16T12:13:41  <delt0r_> I still bork lisp macros from time to time... and macros of macros don't work the way i generally expect
2011-01-16T12:14:40  <jmcarthur> no need to make excuses for using a language you are reliable with instead of one that's more fun
2011-01-16T12:15:02  <delt0r_> that about sums it up
2011-01-16T12:15:30  <delt0r_> either way... I will be happy to provide a stater pack and a visualizer etc...
2011-01-16T12:16:42  <jmcarthur> i'm still going to keep coding my engine. i have a vision that i want to see
2011-01-16T12:17:11  <delt0r_> I meant i would conform to your engine... spec
2011-01-16T12:17:28  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-01-16T12:18:01  <jmcarthur> nothing in stone. if you come up with a comm format before me i could go with that unless there are things i just *really* don't like about it
2011-01-16T12:19:24  <jmcarthur> i probably need to start over anyway... with a more principled, test-driven approach
2011-01-16T12:19:40  <jmcarthur> i was just bashing it out, previously... for prototyping, basically
2011-01-16T12:19:54  <jmcarthur> turns out it's pretty simple though :)
2011-01-16T12:23:37  <jmcarthur> for the comm format i'm thinking we should stick with the same overall format as what i was going for with the tron game
2011-01-16T12:23:43  <jmcarthur> extensible, simple
2011-01-16T12:24:57  <delt0r_> yea
2011-01-16T12:25:11  <delt0r_> well i won't get to to at least next weekend

2011-01-16T12:49:28  <jmcarthur> i'm just saying the spy always beat the marshal

2011-01-16T13:19:04  <delt0r_> how about if the marshal attacks it wins
2011-01-16T13:19:14  <delt0r_> but if both attack... the spy wins
2011-01-16T13:19:53  <delt0r_> and finally what about "chained" movement
2011-01-16T13:19:56  <delt0r_> ie
2011-01-16T13:20:01  <delt0r_> A,b
2011-01-16T13:20:09  <delt0r_> sorry
2011-01-16T13:20:17  <delt0r_> A->B->C->
2011-01-16T13:20:34  <delt0r_> A can move because B moves etc
2011-01-16T13:20:48  <delt0r_> in the same turn.. of course... if one is in a fight.....
2011-01-16T13:24:31  <jmcarthur> this works out fine as long as two units moving directly at other fight before units that will simply share a square after moving
2011-01-16T13:24:46  <delt0r_> ??
2011-01-16T13:24:56  <jmcarthur> so if we have positions X, Y, and Z where A1 and A2 are on X and Y respectively and B is on Z and A1 is moving to Z, A2 is moving to X, and B is moving to X... A1 and B will fight first. if B wins, B moves to X and then B and A2 fight on X
2011-01-16T13:25:16  <jmcarthur> i think i got that right. lemme read over it
2011-01-16T13:25:21  <jmcarthur> ... might require making a diagram
2011-01-16T13:25:45  <delt0r_> why do A1 and B fight first... won't the order make a difference
2011-01-16T13:25:46  <jmcarthur> oh wron
2011-01-16T13:25:47  <jmcarthur> g
2011-01-16T13:26:09  <jmcarthur> i set up the scenario wrong and but then explained what would happen for a different scenario
2011-01-16T13:26:14  <jmcarthur> let me just write up a fresh one
2011-01-16T13:26:23  <jmcarthur> i'll do diagrams and make a gist
2011-01-16T13:28:27  <delt0r_> this means every unit that can move... could move in a turn
2011-01-16T13:28:36  <jmcarthur> right
2011-01-16T13:29:08  <delt0r_> but fights would break this... and order does matter (im pretty certain )
2011-01-16T13:29:29  <jmcarthur> fights won't break it if the order is well-defined, and i have a well-defined order
2011-01-16T13:29:34  <jmcarthur> i'm trying to write up an explanation
2011-01-16T13:29:44  <delt0r_> This can be resovled in a order independnat manner as i did in my ants engine
2011-01-16T13:30:35  <delt0r_> I don't think their should be  a "specified" order... I think at that stage a single unit per turn works better again
2011-01-16T13:33:32  <jmcarthur> this makes sense though. if two units are moving toward each other it makes sense that they would fight each other "as they move", before the fights that happen when units finally arrive at their destinations
2011-01-16T13:34:07  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: https://gist.github.com/782013
2011-01-16T13:34:33  <delt0r_> yes... but what can and can't move depends on the fight results... this can even effect *what* fights if you think about units move "sideways" into a wall of moving units
2011-01-16T13:34:34  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.30.59> has quit IRC (Quit: *poof!*)
2011-01-16T13:34:49  <jmcarthur> that's not true
2011-01-16T13:34:57  <jmcarthur> the movement rules are consistent regardless of the fight results
2011-01-16T13:35:13  <delt0r_> How so
2011-01-16T13:35:21  <jmcarthur> what is the scenario you have in mind?
2011-01-16T13:35:53  <delt0r_> if two unit "move  past each other" then how the fight turns out, changes which square is occupied after the fight
2011-01-16T13:35:58  <jmcarthur> the rules here are just that mutual attacks are carried out before movements. the winner always gets to move though, and no other units' movements are affected by it
2011-01-16T13:36:06  <jmcarthur> yes, but not how movement works
2011-01-16T13:36:16  <jmcarthur> it just changes the outcomes of other fights
2011-01-16T13:36:59  <delt0r_> which is now order dependent...
2011-01-16T13:37:04  <jmcarthur> no it's not
2011-01-16T13:37:16  <jmcarthur> concrete scenario?
2011-01-16T13:37:20  <delt0r_> In your example
2011-01-16T13:37:31  <jmcarthur> the movements are the same either way
2011-01-16T13:37:51  <jmcarthur> it makes sense that the fights could have different outcomes depending on the units. that's... just how stratego works
2011-01-16T13:37:52  <delt0r_> if A1 loses agaist B
2011-01-16T13:37:55  <delt0r_> then A2 fights
2011-01-16T13:38:00  <delt0r_> as well
2011-01-16T13:38:02  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-01-16T13:38:11  <jmcarthur> i don't see that as a negative
2011-01-16T13:38:28  <delt0r_> so now with more than 3 you can construct a loop where the result depends on where you start
2011-01-16T13:38:36  <jmcarthur> it's just that units that fight while moving get to fight before units that arrive at their destinations. it makes physical and practical sense to me
2011-01-16T13:38:39  <delt0r_> I am pretty sure
2011-01-16T13:38:39  <jmcarthur> no
2011-01-16T13:38:40  <delt0r_> you can
2011-01-16T13:38:47  <jmcarthur> i'll demonstrate
2011-01-16T13:38:55  <jmcarthur> with intermediate steps shown
2011-01-16T13:39:13  <jmcarthur> if you can come up with the scenario you think would not work
2011-01-16T13:40:02  <delt0r_> doing so now
2011-01-16T13:40:11  <jmcarthur> this hinges on not allowing a bot to send two of its own units to the same square on the same turn

2011-01-16T13:45:21  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: for the record, i know that i'm write because the code i wrote is comonadic, which just means that if squares also contain bot orders, the future state of each square can be uniquely determined in isolation of the future states of the other squares
2011-01-16T13:45:39  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: that is, it's parallelizable to the granularity of individual squares
2011-01-16T13:45:53  <jmcarthur> *that i'm right
2011-01-16T13:46:02  <jmcarthur> how do i use the wrong word like that ?!
2011-01-16T13:46:37  <delt0r_> I think you may be right... with the addition of the rule that a player cannot send two units to the same square...
2011-01-16T13:46:45  <delt0r_> for 2 player games anyways
2011-01-16T13:46:56  <jmcarthur> yeah, it falls apart with more than 2 players

2011-01-16T13:50:23  <delt0r_> we have fights with ones that swap

2011-01-16T13:50:43  <jmcarthur> right, and movement technically happens in between
2011-01-16T13:50:49  <delt0r_> yes
2011-01-16T13:53:23  <jmcarthur> the simultaneous movement combines the uncertainty of stratego with some micromanagement, obviously
2011-01-16T13:53:27  <delt0r_> still think i would prefer a 1 unit per turn... game... but code wise its easy enough to do both

2011-01-16T20:31:57  <antimatroid1> poo crap, is there a way to include a .txt file with source files to read from and actually know it'll be accessible when the program runs?

2011-01-16T20:37:44  <delt0r___> no
2011-01-16T20:37:50  <delt0r___> unless you use java
2011-01-16T20:37:52  <delt0r___> ;)
2011-01-16T20:40:03  <antimatroid1> oh well, i think i only need it for testing anyway
2011-01-16T20:40:29  <antimatroid1> it's just so i can tell it what to do the first few moves, for testing the game mechanics
2011-01-16T20:40:57  <delt0r___> there are "hacky" ways...
2011-01-16T20:41:13  <delt0r___> the proper way... is to have the file as part of the installation...
2011-01-16T20:41:52  <antimatroid1> one has to submit source files, can a source file include a text file?
2011-01-16T20:42:38  <Zannick> theoretically
2011-01-16T20:43:40  <delt0r___> but there is no expectation that you will have read access in the execution env
2011-01-16T20:43:49  <delt0r___> basically its needs to be "supported"

2011-01-16T20:59:26  <antimatroid1> i just realised i've never seen someone write u'r, while I hate that kind of writing, that would make me chuckle

2011-01-16T21:20:48  <sigh> antimatroid1: wikipedia claims that u're can be used in the place you're although I would be suspicious as they do not cite any sources (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language#Combinations_of_the_above_can_shorten_a_single_or_multiple_words)
2011-01-16T21:22:48  <sigh> I would argue that if you are optimising over the number of characters, then u'r is just redundant and context should suffice to resolve any ambiguity between u'r and ur as is the case in spoken language

2011-01-16T21:23:47  <antimatroid1> if I was to be so shit as to write like that, I would use u'r
2011-01-16T21:23:55  <antimatroid1> but i'm just difficult

2011-01-16T21:24:59  <sigh> If I may continue this absurd analysis, I would content that you are being ungrammatical as u'r would imply that it is a contraction, but if "you" is written as "u" and "are" is written as "r" then "you are" should be written as "ur" without requiring any contraction
2011-01-16T21:25:35  <sigh> * I would contend
2011-01-16T21:25:38  <antimatroid1> my life revolves around analysing silly things :)
2011-01-16T21:26:17  <antimatroid1> so youare should be good? (my english is terrible)
2011-01-16T21:26:22  <antimatroid1> or u'?
2011-01-16T21:26:32  <antimatroid1> for ur?
2011-01-16T21:28:01  <sigh> u' is beside the point, I was arguing that u'r is not a contraction, not that any contraction is valid
2011-01-16T21:29:59  <sigh> and in english adjoining two words is not without precendent, many new words are formed this way... so writing ur does not violate any fundamental rules
2011-01-16T21:31:18  <sigh> youare is not valid by convention only, it would easily be a word in it's own right
2011-01-16T21:31:46  <antimatroid1> hmmm, i think i'll stick to maths
2011-01-16T21:32:34  <sigh> youare might even take on a slightly different meaning (cf "can not" vs "cannot")
2011-01-16T21:34:07  <antimatroid1> youare is gross :P

2011-01-16T21:38:18  <sigh> indeed, youare's lack of aesthetic appeal would hinder its acceptance into the english lexicon. I'd happily wager that any such venture would be doomed to failure. I was only considering its hypothetical existence to advance argument against u'r, and you are mistaken if you think I really do think that youare should be regarded as cromulent :P
2011-01-16T21:39:06  <antimatroid1> are you sure you weren't an english major?
2011-01-16T21:39:51  <sigh> how do you know I'm not? :P

2011-01-16T21:44:29  <sigh> anyway, I would say the discussion falls more under the scope of linguistics than anything an english major would study
2011-01-16T21:52:41  <antimatroid1> there is a lot of work in making this snowballs bot
2011-01-16T21:57:20  <sigh> think of the kids in africa who don't even have snowballs, not get back to work and finish your bot
2011-01-16T21:57:29  <sigh> *now
2011-01-16T22:03:47  <antimatroid1> haha
2011-01-16T22:03:51  <antimatroid1> i don't have snowballs either :(
2011-01-16T22:04:03  <antimatroid1> does that mean I am comparable to an African kid?
2011-01-16T22:05:06  <sigh> depending on how you implement comparable
2011-01-16T22:05:22  <antimatroid1> lack of snowballs gives full equivalence
2011-01-16T22:05:47  <antimatroid1> i feel their pain
2011-01-16T22:05:50  <sigh> well, you've answered your own question then
