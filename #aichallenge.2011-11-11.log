2011-11-11T00:00:00  <Rinum> lol
2011-11-11T00:00:16  <BenJackson_> mine hit 57.64
2011-11-11T00:00:19  <Rinum> have you made any submissions after that?
2011-11-11T00:00:21  <BenJackson_> lots of ants got no orders due to timeouts and stuff
2011-11-11T00:00:22  <thestinger> I got to rank 27 with my previous upload - it had no combat or awareness of enemy ants
2011-11-11T00:00:33  <thestinger> it just took ~a week to climb up from rank 50
2011-11-11T00:00:39  <BenJackson_> my previous one hit 78.19
2011-11-11T00:00:44  <Rinum> nice!

2011-11-11T00:01:02  <BenJackson_> my new one slaughters my old one in local game tests
2011-11-11T00:01:17  <BenJackson_> but I only uploaded last night so I'm not getting competitive games yet
2011-11-11T00:01:43  <BenJackson_> I did lose one but I can't learn much from it:  rankings were almost totally luck in that game
2011-11-11T00:02:06  <Rinum> your bot looks great!
2011-11-11T00:02:56  <BenJackson_> it has been really interesting to work on it
2011-11-11T00:03:15  <BenJackson_> my early ideas about combat were so wrong
2011-11-11T00:03:19  <BenJackson_> sooo wrong
2011-11-11T00:03:28  <Rinum> lol mine too
2011-11-11T00:04:12  <nickjohnson> I'd love to run a bot with a lot of tweakable knobs, like CD, through a simulated annealing process to find the best settings
2011-11-11T00:04:13  <Rinum> I'm definitely glad I ditched python though
2011-11-11T00:04:17  <nickjohnson> I'm betting it would make a big difference
2011-11-11T00:04:53  <datachomper> Rinum:  I ditched python also and it's so much easier now
2011-11-11T00:05:04  <thestinger> I did too :)
2011-11-11T00:05:20  <thestinger> using C++ for this makes it much easier imo, because you barely have to worry about performance
2011-11-11T00:05:30  <Rinum> yup
2011-11-11T00:05:43  <thestinger> with python I would have had to make a bunch of compromises or figure out much better algorithms than what I'm using
2011-11-11T00:05:48  <Rinum> unless you're using an n^4 algorithm x.x
2011-11-11T00:06:28  <BenJackson_> not worrying about timeouts is nice, but simulating 750 turn games in 20 seconds is fantastic
2011-11-11T00:06:38  <thestinger> I don't have real coordinated combat yet, so the time is basically independent of the number of ants
2011-11-11T00:08:15  <a1k0n> i also am revamping my combat.  i have some promising simulations now but i have no idea if i can scale this
2011-11-11T00:08:35  <BenJackson_> early I didn't worry abuot suiciding into other bots
2011-11-11T00:08:49  <BenJackson_> then I realized that in an N-way game if I cancel out one other guy we both just went -1 vs everyone else
2011-11-11T00:08:51  <a1k0n> yeah, you need to make some sort of tradeoff
2011-11-11T00:08:58  <BenJackson_> so it turns out just "not suiciding" is the first big combat step
2011-11-11T00:09:02  <a1k0n> heh.
2011-11-11T00:09:10  <a1k0n> a 2 for 1 ratio might be good.
2011-11-11T00:09:25  <BenJackson_> yeah, now that I have combat I don't worry about it as much
2011-11-11T00:09:43  <BenJackson_> but early on I dismissed it as "oh I'll just feed fast and crash into things"
2011-11-11T00:09:55  <BenJackson_> then people developed the "square defense"
2011-11-11T00:10:04  <BenJackson_> it's pretty funny to watch blind bots crash into that
2011-11-11T00:10:04  <a1k0n> but yeah my bot is combat aware to a point, but is unable to coordinate at all, so will still send hundreds of ants in a single-file column into certain death
2011-11-11T00:10:08  <a1k0n> yep
2011-11-11T00:10:20  <datachomper> square defense?
2011-11-11T00:10:30  <a1k0n> an ant on each corner of a hill
2011-11-11T00:10:32  <BenJackson_> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=81875&user=3469
2011-11-11T00:10:32  <thestinger> my ants basically just strafe/encircle the enemy until they aren't outnumbered, there's no coordination
2011-11-11T00:10:42  <BenJackson_> that's one of Rinum's games, look at "wilsone"
2011-11-11T00:10:56  <datachomper> haha, cool idea
2011-11-11T00:10:58  <thestinger> I allow 1 for 1 trades though, so it doesn't work very well atm :P
2011-11-11T00:11:07  <BenJackson_> once I figured out how to do "ant on each corner" I realized I knew how to do that "GG" thing one guy was doing
2011-11-11T00:11:18  <a1k0n> heh, yeah.  that was awesome.
2011-11-11T00:11:29  <a1k0n> that's temping to add.
2011-11-11T00:11:50  <nickjohnson> "ant on each corner"?
2011-11-11T00:11:57  <a1k0n> a a
2011-11-11T00:11:58  <a1k0n>  o
2011-11-11T00:11:58  <BenJackson_> I'm not sure if "square defense" took off on aichallenge.org but it was an early fluxid innovation and pretty soon everyone had it
2011-11-11T00:11:59  <a1k0n> a a
2011-11-11T00:12:00  <thestinger> yeah, the static X defense formation
2011-11-11T00:12:04  <a1k0n> a being ant, o being hill
2011-11-11T00:12:05  <nickjohnson> Of your hive?
2011-11-11T00:12:07  <nickjohnson> ah
2011-11-11T00:12:18  <nickjohnson> So what's the "GG thing", then?
2011-11-11T00:12:20  <thestinger> I see people using a + formation too, but it doesn't work as well
2011-11-11T00:12:25  <BenJackson_> I can save you some time if you want to watch my v5 on a multi-hill maze to see how NOT to do it
2011-11-11T00:12:32  <BenJackson_> I was letting it burn way too many ants on defense
2011-11-11T00:12:54  <BenJackson_> nickjohnson: some bot spells out "GG" In ants when it has a large surplus
2011-11-11T00:12:59  <nickjohnson> hah, nice
2011-11-11T00:13:15  <nickjohnson> Hm, the main problem with defensive formations would be making sure you don't form them until you have enough ants
2011-11-11T00:13:23  <nickjohnson> Otherwise I'd just make them very attractive hill-climbing spots :)
2011-11-11T00:13:23  <BenJackson_> as I said
2011-11-11T00:13:35  <Rinum> BenJackson_: lmao, have an example of the GG in action?
2011-11-11T00:13:41  <thestinger> yeah, I've left out defense so far - I'm trying out various ideas though
2011-11-11T00:13:48  <BenJackson_> Rinum: I don't remember who it was
2011-11-11T00:13:49  <thestinger> adding the square formation thing ruined my bot :P
2011-11-11T00:15:28  <BenJackson_> argh it's hard to find multi-hill mazes by name in the game list

2011-11-11T00:19:33  <Rinum> it's broken 90 before... happened again recently
2011-11-11T00:19:40  <_flag> Although if you look at the mus there are a few people that are somewhat close
2011-11-11T00:19:48  <_flag> Just with higher sigmas
2011-11-11T00:19:48  <u_> mus?
2011-11-11T00:19:52  <_flag> GreenTea, for example
2011-11-11T00:19:58  <_flag> However over the skill
2011-11-11T00:20:18  <_flag> The mu is the estimated rating, and the sigma is the certaintity of that rating
2011-11-11T00:20:25  <_flag> The skill is the mu - sigma*3
2011-11-11T00:20:48  <a1k0n> i worry that his sigma is artificially low because of the long history
2011-11-11T00:21:04  <_flag> Possibily
2011-11-11T00:21:33  <_flag> Losing games like this is extremely frustrating: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=83510&user=31
2011-11-11T00:21:35  <BenJackson_> what's scarier is that his bot has obvious bugs
2011-11-11T00:21:42  <u_> how can you see mu and sigma?
2011-11-11T00:21:45  <BenJackson_> so he could definitely swoop in with big improvements if needed
2011-11-11T00:21:48  <BenJackson_> u_: hover over "score"

2011-11-11T00:21:53  <a1k0n> skill
2011-11-11T00:22:10  <Rinum> BenJackson_: he's definitely improving his bot
2011-11-11T00:22:20  <BenJackson_> _flag: well I just watched one of his recent games where he nearly stalemated despite having 500+ ants because he didn't push his advantage
2011-11-11T00:22:32  <BenJackson_> one of his hills was bottled up by a bot which timed out leaving a "plug" that he didn't go through
2011-11-11T00:22:48  <u_> i've never seen a bot break through a plug like that
2011-11-11T00:22:50  <BenJackson_> his combat clearly is of the type which gives a fixed output for a fixed input
2011-11-11T00:22:57  <BenJackson_> u_ oh, mine would
2011-11-11T00:23:04  <BenJackson_> my combat is sort of sloppy-aggressive
2011-11-11T00:23:20  <_flag> Ah, yeah I've seen that too. That's true of most of the top because because they're left over from the beta where engaging in combat of any kind where victory was not certain was bad because there were no hills to worry about :)
2011-11-11T00:23:40  <BenJackson_> in fact if you watch one of my recent games one of the bots times out and I do eventually cap it despite the huge clog of ants it leaves
2011-11-11T00:24:06  <BenJackson_> _flag: AHHH I had wondered why the top ants were so super conservative about fighting
2011-11-11T00:24:33  <BenJackson_> my algorithm just doesn't capture the idea of defense very well :)

2011-11-11T00:25:17  <BenJackson_> somewhat, yes
2011-11-11T00:25:19  <_flag> Simply because the game is a free-for-all multiplayer type
2011-11-11T00:25:34  <_flag> And it's beneficial to allow your opponents to fight each other while you gain a massive advantage

2011-11-11T00:27:08  <BenJackson_> OH you're strcat
2011-11-11T00:27:13  <thestinger> every time I add a feature I make a branch in git, and test it on the tcp server
2011-11-11T00:27:27  <thestinger> some things like defense ended up making the bot worse
2011-11-11T00:27:31  <grom358> I found something last night I really want to try now
2011-11-11T00:27:34  <BenJackson_> sometimes I look at fluxid and my bot is playing every game against strcat version somethingorother
2011-11-11T00:27:38  <thestinger> so they're still branches :)
2011-11-11T00:27:45  <grom358> Cooperative A* pathfinding :)
2011-11-11T00:27:53  <_flag> strcat is the bot that most frequently kills me on tcp simply by rushing my hill with all its ants :P
2011-11-11T00:28:04  <BenJackson_> my fluxid bot is old
2011-11-11T00:28:20  <Rinum> thestinger: your bots are good!
2011-11-11T00:28:21  <BenJackson_> I debated updating it but I figure instant death is not that useful to people trying to get started
2011-11-11T00:28:37  <grom358> I still have zero combat lol
2011-11-11T00:28:38  <thestinger> their stupidity gets them points :)
2011-11-11T00:28:42  <grom358> I keep playing around with pathfinding
2011-11-11T00:29:09  <thestinger> improving my movement made up for my lack of combat a lot
2011-11-11T00:29:27  <grom358> yeah.. i need some sort of flocking or something on the enemy hill
2011-11-11T00:29:36  <grom358> that would sort out a lot for me
2011-11-11T00:29:54  <grom358> I already have avoid code when gathering
2011-11-11T00:30:05  <grom358> just need something little smarter for attacking a hill
2011-11-11T00:30:17  <grom358> instead of going in line towards it
2011-11-11T00:30:19  <BenJackson_> thestinger: nice thing about a bunch of git branches is also having a stable of local bots to try new versions against
2011-11-11T00:31:08  <grom358> yeah I still haven't setup git yet lol.. will be soon though
2011-11-11T00:31:24  <thestinger> BenJackson_: yeah, having a version of my bot that does defense is very useful for testing
2011-11-11T00:32:01  <BenJackson_> the one pre-combat version I keep around is getting too weak at this point
2011-11-11T00:32:19  <grom358> thestinger: without giving away too much of your secrets.. how exactly are u doing combat? I haven't thought of a way to deal with it yet
2011-11-11T00:32:19  <BenJackson_> it is simulating the imbalance that results from having a weak neighbor vs a strong neighbor
2011-11-11T00:33:12  <grom358> I haven't got the foggest idea yet on how to get multiple ants to coordinate an attack
2011-11-11T00:33:33  <thestinger> grom358: I'm not really doing coordinated combat
2011-11-11T00:33:37  <thestinger> it's just movement code
2011-11-11T00:34:10  <thestinger> I'm going to switch to doing something like putting all orders on a queue and altering them for combat
2011-11-11T00:34:17  <grom358> is the movement coordinated? so you have a wall on the front line?
2011-11-11T00:34:54  <thestinger> sort of, they'll try to form a wall when they reach enemies
2011-11-11T00:35:01  <thestinger> until then it's pathfinding/movement
2011-11-11T00:35:30  <grom358> so do you have a structure/class for forming walls? so the wall can move as one?
2011-11-11T00:35:34  <BenJackson_> thestinger: care to point out a fluxid (or aichallenge) replay that shows the state of the art in strcat_* bots?
2011-11-11T00:36:37  <BenJackson_> grom358: my tip would be that forming walls and stuff is better produced as emergent behavior of a general combat algorithm than by trying to do it explicitly
2011-11-11T00:38:06  <grom358> BenJackson: yeah.. that is what I was hoping todo. Somehow get a number of ants to be focusing on a cell at the same time
2011-11-11T00:38:38  <thestinger> BenJackson_: hmm, hard to find a good game - strcat_next and strcat_gatherzone are basically my current codebase though
2011-11-11T00:38:55  <a1k0n> thestinger: oh you're strcat?
2011-11-11T00:39:04  <thestinger> yeah :)
2011-11-11T00:39:09  <BenJackson_> grom358: there is (IMO) an element of "aha" puzzle to ant combat
2011-11-11T00:39:13  <a1k0n> strcat_combat is like 10 times stronger than strcat_gather
2011-11-11T00:39:29  <BenJackson_> I really would like to discuss it but I fear it is seriously against my interests
2011-11-11T00:39:40  <thestinger> strcat_forage is just to amuse me - it basically just forages and disregards everything else
2011-11-11T00:39:48  <a1k0n> BenJackson_: haha, same here
2011-11-11T00:39:52  <grom358> BenJackson: fair enough
2011-11-11T00:40:05  <nickjohnson> thestinger: That'd be great if winners were determined by numbers ;)
2011-11-11T00:40:27  <nickjohnson> I've wondered how well a bot that attempts to distribute itself evenly over the map would do. Perhaps in groups of 4 to make it difficult to wipe out the 'nodes'.
2011-11-11T00:40:33  <nickjohnson> Probably not wonderfully, but it'd be amusing at least.
2011-11-11T00:41:33  <BenJackson_> every damn time I play new games on fluxid I'm reminded of how food-poor it is
2011-11-11T00:41:39  <BenJackson_> and somehow every time I forget about it
2011-11-11T00:41:42  <grom358> speak of the devil.. I just played strcat bot again :)
2011-11-11T00:41:51  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.29800 this basically shows you what my bots do when they don't get wiped out early on due to lack of defense
2011-11-11T00:42:10  <thestinger> it works well on mazes, but they suck at the random walk maps
2011-11-11T00:42:18  <thestinger> my defense branch does a lot better on those
2011-11-11T00:42:48  <grom358> lol.. I have token defence.. I post ants on the corners of my hills
2011-11-11T00:43:06  <grom358> seems to stop a lot of attacks

2011-11-11T00:52:37  <grom358> like getting ants to fight other ants with minimal loses
2011-11-11T00:53:10  *** praveen_ <praveen_!cf2e371e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.207.46.55.30> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-11T00:53:19  <Rinum> my bot runs faster when there are more ants in the field x.x
2011-11-11T00:53:34  <thestinger> my bot speeds up a lot as it explores
2011-11-11T00:53:42  <thestinger> maybe the same thing is going on with yours?
2011-11-11T00:53:46  <grom358> I have an order queue... but I need someway to have orders that are only issued with other orders.. like batch orders that are all or nothing
2011-11-11T00:54:18  <Rinum> yup
2011-11-11T00:54:53  *** Rofer is now known as rofer
2011-11-11T00:54:58  <BenJackson_> is it possible your ant actually runs faster when it has seen more of the map?
2011-11-11T00:55:12  <BenJackson_> the default fill type is "LAND" (at least in the python and c++ starters)
2011-11-11T00:55:27  <BenJackson_> so the less you've seen the more willing your pathfinding might be to flood fill the entire map area
2011-11-11T00:55:56  <Rinum> I'm using CD on all the nonvisible parts
2011-11-11T00:56:07  <grom358> how exactly does that work? My bot assumes a tile is land if it hasn't been seen yet.. So as I explore I don't have to reculate paths as much.. but doesn't really get faster AFAIK
2011-11-11T00:56:21  <Rinum> which is very expensive with my code
2011-11-11T00:56:35  <BenJackson_> my python bot saved paths
2011-11-11T00:56:35  <grom358> oh.. I see.. yeah less to search on maze maps as it finds water tiles
2011-11-11T00:56:37  <BenJackson_> my c++ bot doesn't
2011-11-11T00:56:39  <Antimony> I don't bother calculating paths anymore
2011-11-11T00:56:47  <Rinum> I don't use paths anymore
2011-11-11T00:57:12  <Antimony> I think combat is the main difficulty in writing a good bot
2011-11-11T00:57:19  <grom358> how do you move then? just random walk?
2011-11-11T00:57:21  <Antimony> I'm trying to figure out how to implement some combat in mine
2011-11-11T00:57:43  <Antimony> I build up a distance map and just use gradient descent
2011-11-11T00:57:47  <Antimony> well
2011-11-11T00:57:51  <Antimony> sort of
2011-11-11T00:58:00  <BenJackson_> yep, that's what I did when I switched to c++
2011-11-11T00:58:03  <Antimony> ebasically I'm using A*
2011-11-11T00:58:08  <BenJackson_> out of paranoia about how slow the python had been
2011-11-11T00:58:16  <Rinum> lol
2011-11-11T00:58:18  <Antimony> but I recalcualte everything each tick
2011-11-11T00:58:26  <BenJackson_> (first version took like 5ms/turn)
2011-11-11T00:59:25  <Antimony> Darn. my current bot seems to be doing badly
2011-11-11T00:59:35  <Antimony> it's still at skill 50 after 5 games
2011-11-11T01:00:00  <BenJackson_> heh, I was trying to project where my current bot will go by comparing its skill trajectory
2011-11-11T01:00:08  <Rinum> TIL ants can kill ants across water x.x
2011-11-11T01:00:20  <grom358> the problem with A*.. say you see food. How do you determine the closest ant to said food? A* needs start and end points
2011-11-11T01:00:30  <BenJackson_> then I realized you can just hover "score" and see mu directly
2011-11-11T01:00:56  <BenJackson_> A* does, but A* is just a refinement of BFS to avoid searching as broadly
2011-11-11T01:01:09  <BenJackson_> I can tell you for sure that it's not necessary if you're working in C++
2011-11-11T01:01:23  <BenJackson_> and (though I never really tried to fix it) ieven A* is not fast enough for python

2011-11-11T01:02:49  <Antimony> ACtually
2011-11-11T01:03:02  <Antimony> I don't bother finding the closest ant ot each food
2011-11-11T01:03:20  <Antimony> I do have anticlustering to reduce the frequency of multiple ants goign to teh same food though
2011-11-11T01:03:35  <grom358> the only time I use A* is for recalculating paths from the BFS search.. like say the BFS path included an unexplored water tile.. then I drop the path and use A* to the target
2011-11-11T01:04:14  <grom358> so yeah.. in the end A* is used very little in my bot
2011-11-11T01:04:24  <BenJackson_> personally I think anyone who is trying to remember a given ant from one turn to another is probably making a mistake
2011-11-11T01:04:41  <Antimony> Currently I remember ants but I don't use the info for anything
2011-11-11T01:05:01  <grom358> BenJackson: I do it to save the paths
2011-11-11T01:05:07  <Antimony> Well I remember my ants. Enemies are a lot harder
2011-11-11T01:05:27  <Antimony> I used to save paths, but recalculating each turn is easier and more effective
2011-11-11T01:05:38  <grom358> and sometimes I getting random spikes in performance of my Java bot... if in C++ could probably just recalculate each turn

2011-11-11T01:06:40  <grom358> I have a bot that I was working on that didn't save paths but couldn't get it working
2011-11-11T01:07:05  <Antimony> Switch to C++
2011-11-11T01:07:22  <Antimony> And then you won't have to worry about Java's awfull syntax either
2011-11-11T01:07:34  <grom358> Java syntax no worse then C++ really
2011-11-11T01:07:41  <Antimony> it's a lot more verbose
2011-11-11T01:07:56  <grom358> depends
2011-11-11T01:08:10  <grom358> they pretty similar in verbose to me
2011-11-11T01:08:13  <BenJackson_> I was going to use Scala but then I saw that post that said their JRE sandboxing for the contest had performance issues
2011-11-11T01:08:15  <Antimony> foo.bar += 3 vs foo.setBar( foo.getBar() + 3)?
2011-11-11T01:08:17  <BenJackson_> sooo I said fuckit and used C++
2011-11-11T01:08:38  <BenJackson_> actually I've improved my knowledge of STL doing this which is nice
2011-11-11T01:08:45  <Antimony> take something like declaring a list of integers
2011-11-11T01:08:45  <thestinger> I learned C++ for this :)
2011-11-11T01:08:56  <Antimony> in C++, you just do std::Vector<int> foo;
2011-11-11T01:09:09  <Antimony> in Java you have List<Integer> foo = new ArrayList<Integer>();
2011-11-11T01:09:34  <grom358> Antimony: doing two different things there.. your C++ example is declaring it on the stack
2011-11-11T01:09:41  <grom358> the Java one is on the heap
2011-11-11T01:09:43  <Antimony> well JAva doesn't even give you the option
2011-11-11T01:09:52  <Antimony> most of the time you want it on the stack
2011-11-11T01:09:59  <grom358> true
2011-11-11T01:10:04  <BenJackson_> Antimony: In that replay it almost looks like blu has a 50 ant threshold to change behavior
2011-11-11T01:10:17  <grom358> but the JIT puts it on the stack a lot of the time
2011-11-11T01:10:44  <BenJackson_> grom358: actually the "control" information for std::vector<int> is on the stack but its contents are allocated
2011-11-11T01:10:56  <BenJackson_> c++0x has std::array if you want it all on the stack
2011-11-11T01:11:08  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-11T01:11:14  <Antimony> or boost::array if you've got an old compiler

2011-11-11T01:13:52  <Antimony> is there  anywhere you can get a fixed version?
2011-11-11T01:14:03  <thestinger> I don't think so
2011-11-11T01:14:13  <thestinger> the server is much worse than the client, fluxid has to keep restarting it
2011-11-11T01:14:26  <thestinger> it leaks a whole thread after each game or something :\

2011-11-11T01:17:33  <Antimony> Do you have special timeout code for tcp?

2011-11-11T01:36:33  <BenJackson_> keep in mind that the time controls are wall clock, too
2011-11-11T01:36:46  <BenJackson_> so on the official servers you're competing for CPU with everyone
2011-11-11T01:36:58  <BenJackson_> if you need a lot of cpu you're going to have that much more trouble
2011-11-11T01:37:35  <BenJackson_> (also the default attempt to avoid timeouts in python uses time.clock() which doesn't work on any system I've tried)
2011-11-11T01:38:41  <pairofdice> Oh, you're right
2011-11-11T01:38:55  <pairofdice> Just kidding

2011-11-11T03:21:09  <delt0r_> Fluxid: how do you feel about folks running more than one bot on your server? ie different versions?
2011-11-11T03:22:25  <Garf> delt0r_: can't see anyone objecting to that. I certainly plan to do so.
2011-11-11T03:22:36  <Garf> delt0r_: all the more because of the sigma issues on the tcp server
2011-11-11T03:22:38  <BenJackson_> lots of people already are
2011-11-11T03:22:43  <BenJackson_> the rankings on fluxid are fucked anyway
2011-11-11T03:22:58  <delt0r_> yea i guessed

2011-11-11T03:23:24  <BenJackson_> I think I held back until I saw fluxid_vN appear
2011-11-11T03:23:25  <delt0r_> My current bot has a few serious bugs... i am surprised it wins at all
2011-11-11T03:23:56  <delt0r_> It can't see other ants for example... it thinks its playing all on its own
2011-11-11T03:24:10  <delt0r_> and i keeps running away from enemy ant hills
2011-11-11T03:24:24  <delt0r_> not to mention it has no concept of its own hills

2011-11-11T03:29:56  <BenJackson_> but in the big 5-6-7-8-way games there can be a lot of chaos

2011-11-11T03:30:11  <BenJackson_> or seemingly insignificant different initial actions

2011-11-11T04:24:12  <praveen__> yeah that's what am thinking
2011-11-11T04:25:26  <Minthos> praveen__: it could also be a bug in your code causing infinite loop or excessive iterations
2011-11-11T04:25:48  <Conorach> would it be possible to have the tcpClient correct for lag?
2011-11-11T04:25:56  <Conorach> although it would be an easy exploit I guess :/
2011-11-11T04:27:09  <praveen__> unlikely all the code I have is two for loops. Am just starting to implement and this is not a good sign. Already thinking to move from Java
2011-11-11T04:27:28  <Minthos> the turn time is 5 seconds, if you have more lag than that you need to test against someone else on earth escape trajectory
2011-11-11T04:27:52  <pairofdice> How low can you set turntime locally and not time-out against hunterbot

2011-11-11T04:35:59  <delt0r_> Fluxid: right.. thx
2011-11-11T04:38:33  <delt0r_> Conorach: its not easy to "correct" for lag
2011-11-11T04:39:07  <delt0r_> 2 reasons, first it is not constant in time... it changes... and high lag connections to change the most over time
2011-11-11T04:40:27  <delt0r_> 2ndly, measuring it... is not as easy as it looks. Pings only give you ball park figures. Just look at the ntp protocol to see how to accurately measure lag
2011-11-11T04:40:59  <delt0r_> finally what does it really mean? it is easy to add 1000ms to the time out
2011-11-11T04:41:33  <delt0r_> praveen_: bugs are bugs... in any lang... do you have much experiance with java

2011-11-11T05:03:47  <Conorach> yeah I guess you're right delt0r, I was thinking of the simple thing there, like: when tcpClient is ran, make some simple ping measurements and add that to the timeout for that bot, just to correct slightly.
2011-11-11T05:04:04  <Conorach> Just adding another second to the timeout internally (while still telling all bots the normal timeout) would help too I guess :)
2011-11-11T05:04:31  <Conorach> or what about timestamping the messages locally by tcpClient ;)

2011-11-11T06:56:48  <Yexo> We've formed a team after most people already had created an account, although most of us didn't submit anything yet
2011-11-11T06:57:06  <Zao> praveen_: Languages are rather irrelevant, as you should be able to make a robust sufficiently performant bot in any language you know.
2011-11-11T06:57:39  <Yexo> Can we simply make a new account for the team (even if that gives one or two team members acceess to both the team account and their own account) or how should we handle this?

2011-11-11T06:59:39  <delt0r_> cool, i can now watch games from a bots perspective live--aka tcp server
2011-11-11T06:59:48  <delt0r_> would others be interested?
2011-11-11T07:00:41  <delt0r_> praveen_: java is fine... it is pretty fast really, but like all tools.. you need to know how to use it properly
2011-11-11T07:01:11  <delt0r_> you can't write java like C and expect performance for example
2011-11-11T07:01:48  <delt0r_> its also not magic... but i think for a starting out OO lang --its fine. Hell its fine for production use too

2011-11-11T08:34:25  <bugnuts2> you could just refrain from making an illegal move...
2011-11-11T08:34:48  <Yexo> moving to a place where food is about to spawn is hardly an illegal move
2011-11-11T08:35:00  <NoxiaZ^> damn first i didnt know that
2011-11-11T08:35:03  <NoxiaZ^> and next. thats just stupid :S
2011-11-11T08:35:35  <Yexo> or are you moving to the food the turn after it spawned?
2011-11-11T08:35:43  <bugnuts2> moving to a place where food is about to spawn is not illegal, it just blocks the spawn
2011-11-11T08:36:04  <avdg> Yexo: yeah
2011-11-11T08:36:07  <bugnuts2> but if food spawns next to your ant you can't move on top of it
2011-11-11T08:36:14  <avdg> you can check for food collisions before moving
2011-11-11T08:36:50  <avdg> food is only spawned after the ants have been moved

2011-11-11T08:40:00  <Yexo> interesting
2011-11-11T08:40:13  <Yexo> I had so far assumed that would simply kill your ant and the ant on top of the hill since they'd collide

2011-11-11T09:36:59  <Minthos> helps you sort out memory management issues
2011-11-11T09:38:04  <Migi32> hey. Those who use minimax for battles, how does that work?
2011-11-11T09:40:17  <Minthos> you brute force possible moves for your and your opponents' ants and calculate which set of moves is least disadvantageous for you in all scenarios
2011-11-11T09:40:33  <Minthos> then you look for ways to optimize the algorithm so it finishes before your bot times out

2011-11-11T09:43:31  <Migi32> yes, within time constraints
2011-11-11T09:43:38  <antimatroid> talk to mcstar
2011-11-11T09:43:53  <antimatroid> alpha beta pruning will help once you've generated your first layer
2011-11-11T09:44:01  <Migi32> of course it's possible to brute-force all possible moves, but that's already exponential in number of ants, so doing it for more than 1 turn is just insane
2011-11-11T09:44:20  <antimatroid> i think he's also capping it at like 3-4 ants per partition for a game tree

2011-11-11T09:54:33  <Migi32> pairofdice, yes, but each of the bots gets its own CPU core
2011-11-11T09:54:37  <bergmark> pairofdice: Remember reading somewhere you get your own core
2011-11-11T09:54:41  <Rinum> that 500ms limit can change btw
2011-11-11T09:54:42  <pairofdice> Ahh, okay
2011-11-11T09:54:46  <Rinum> so don't hard code it

2011-11-11T10:02:15  <pairofdice> I don't understand why my ants still do this "follow the leader" thing
2011-11-11T10:02:56  <pairofdice> I penalize the paths taken by other ants, or atleast I think I do
2011-11-11T10:03:42  <Rinum> penalize it more?
2011-11-11T10:09:55  <avdg> if overpenalizing doesn't work, its probably a bug ;-)

2011-11-11T10:14:07  <avdg> my ants are stupid in my model
2011-11-11T10:14:31  <avdg> (so they don't have codes, except a few states)
2011-11-11T10:14:57  <avdg> though I wish I could code faster and better
2011-11-11T10:15:42  <pairofdice> I'm pretty happy with how my ants wait for reinforcements now
2011-11-11T10:16:53  <pairofdice> The version on the server gets stuck in death stares even with 20 of my guys against 1 of theirs

2011-11-11T12:56:06  <ikaros> i dont get this
2011-11-11T12:56:41  <conor_f> does chez moi/toi not mean my/your house?
2011-11-11T12:56:52  <a1k0n> i was just gonna say that
2011-11-11T12:57:06  <grwip> yep
2011-11-11T12:57:07  <conor_f> fufu then said but my house the .cmd doesn't throw?
2011-11-11T12:57:15  <conor_f> lol, my french is soo poor :P
2011-11-11T12:57:22  <grwip> but meaning more 'on my machine'...
2011-11-11T12:57:30  <a1k0n> i guess ordinateurs are houses now
2011-11-11T12:57:31  <conor_f> ah, ok
2011-11-11T12:57:35  <conor_f> :P

2011-11-11T12:57:52  <conor_f> lancer == throw? or is it another phrase?
2011-11-11T12:58:02  <Conorach> haha ikaros that is the same for me :/
2011-11-11T12:58:12  <grwip> yes it is, meaning 'run'
2011-11-11T12:58:17  <Conorach> it's like I got a decent bot, then 2 hours later it is only doing shitty things like bang into walks and suicide again :P

2011-11-11T13:14:49  <amstan> define authority
2011-11-11T13:15:18  <amstan> if you're asking who knows a lot about.. kinda of question
2011-11-11T13:15:18  <LouisMartin> who knows best about it.
2011-11-11T13:15:26  <amstan> mcleopold and janzert would be your best bet
2011-11-11T13:15:31  <LouisMartin> about the compilation of the codes in different language
2011-11-11T13:15:38  <amstan> i might be able to answer that too
2011-11-11T13:15:53  <amstan> it's a good idea to ask the question, instead of ask to ask
2011-11-11T13:16:21  <LouisMartin> ok. The way the code is interpreted or compiled makes a huuuge difference in what we can or can't do in C#
2011-11-11T13:16:34  <LouisMartin> amstan: I did, but nobody answered
2011-11-11T13:17:05  <amstan> LouisMartin: ok, what about it? you think we're doing something that's slow for c#?
2011-11-11T13:17:39  <LouisMartin> amstan: first thing to know is: mono can both compiled and interpret C#. Do you compiled it or do you interpret it in the contest?
2011-11-11T13:18:11  <amstan> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py has all the info on how stuff gets compiled
2011-11-11T13:18:19  <mcstar> it is a clr binary
2011-11-11T13:18:23  <grwip> btw, I guess since multi-threading is not allowed you can't use timers in C# right?
2011-11-11T13:18:26  <amstan>  "C#"            : [["gmcs", "-warn:0", "-out:%s.exe" % BOT]],
2011-11-11T13:18:31  <mcstar> it is not a source that gets interpreted
2011-11-11T13:18:36  <amstan> grwip: depends on the type of thread
2011-11-11T13:18:53  <LouisMartin> amstan: I'll take a look, thanks.
2011-11-11T13:19:10  <LouisMartin> mcstar: ok, that a first great news. :P
2011-11-11T13:19:25  <amstan> LouisMartin: there's exes being produce, so i assume they're compiled
2011-11-11T13:19:36  <grwip> oh ok, so some kind of multi threadings are allowed?
2011-11-11T13:19:49  <amstan> grwip: if it's a green thread yes
2011-11-11T13:20:03  <grwip> amstan: ok thx for the precision
2011-11-11T13:20:15  <mcstar> grwip: you want to terminate one thread while it is running by a timer thread?
2011-11-11T13:20:17  <LouisMartin> The optimisation switch makes a world of difference in C#, so that's my next question (which may be answered in the url amstan gave me)
2011-11-11T13:20:49  <amstan> LouisMartin: as long as nothing breaks in people's submissions, we usually accept any changes to the flags
2011-11-11T13:21:05  <grwip> mcstar: I thought about it yes, to avoid timeouts, but I code my bot in java and I don't know how timers works there, but I was wondering for C#...
2011-11-11T13:21:28  <amstan> grwip: green threads are equivalent to doing it manually
2011-11-11T13:21:33  <mcstar> grwip: my intuition says you need os level threads for that, so probably wont work
2011-11-11T13:21:48  <mcstar> maybe on java it will, cause it is enabled for java to spawn multiple threads
2011-11-11T13:22:11  <LouisMartin> amstan: that's awesome. you should charge participation fees   ;)     btw, how did you guys end up putting this contest up together?
2011-11-11T13:23:05  <amstan> LouisMartin: it started as a small contest(10 participants) inside the computer science club at  university of waterloo
2011-11-11T13:23:18  <grwip> mcstar: Interesting, and if you submit a bot that doesn't respect the multi-threading clause, will you be noticed after compilation on the server?
2011-11-11T13:23:32  <mcstar> at runtime
2011-11-11T13:23:33  <amstan> grwip: thread creation will fail
2011-11-11T13:23:57  <grwip> ok, so it'll just not work and may be kind of hard to detect...
2011-11-11T13:24:06  <LouisMartin> amstan: cool
2011-11-11T13:24:22  <amstan> LouisMartin: it's more awesome if it's free
2011-11-11T13:25:07  <pairofdice> Yeah, this is pretty awesome
2011-11-11T13:25:11  <grwip> amstan: that's right but is there some kind of paypal donate stuff somewhere where one can show support?
2011-11-11T13:25:25  <grwip> (not really show, just support)
2011-11-11T13:25:26  <amstan> grwip: yeah, we might get that in the next month or so
2011-11-11T13:25:59  <grwip> this would be a good idea, this challenge is so nice I bet some people would give you something (I guess I'll do!)

2011-11-11T13:30:40  <mcstar> what is the stderr only pipe operator?
2011-11-11T13:30:48  <mcstar> | stdout, |& both
2011-11-11T13:31:28  <amstan> mcstar: good to know |&
2011-11-11T13:31:45  <mcstar> yeah, i knew the other one too
2011-11-11T13:31:48  <thestinger> you can swap the file descriptors iirc
2011-11-11T13:31:50  <mcstar> but the manual is huge
2011-11-11T13:32:09  <Migi32> isn't it 2> ?
2011-11-11T13:32:16  <amstan> Migi32: that goes to a file
2011-11-11T13:32:24  <Migi32> ah yeah, true
2011-11-11T13:32:48  <mcstar> k, i was wrong
2011-11-11T13:32:53  <mcstar> |& is stderr only

2011-11-11T13:33:11  <mcstar> then the engine speaks on stderr:
2011-11-11T13:33:12  <conor_f> is that some sort of a messed up smiley or what?
2011-11-11T13:33:13  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-11T13:33:15  <a1k0n> 2>&1
2011-11-11T13:33:57  <a1k0n> hmm you want to pipe stderr into stdin of another process?
2011-11-11T13:34:40  <mcstar> ok, i think less doesnt respect me
2011-11-11T13:34:44  <mcstar> what i did:
2011-11-11T13:34:53  <mcstar> ./playonesomething |& less
2011-11-11T13:34:58  <mcstar> to capture my bots stderr
2011-11-11T13:35:08  <mcstar> but ./playgame.py's stdout shows up too
2011-11-11T13:35:23  <thestinger> I think |& does both
2011-11-11T13:35:33  <mcstar> thestinger: no
2011-11-11T13:35:39  <mcstar> i looked up in man bash
2011-11-11T13:35:42  <mcstar> says stderr only
2011-11-11T13:35:51  <thestinger> but I tried it and it seems to do both :P
2011-11-11T13:36:04  <mcstar>  If |& is used, the standard error of command is
2011-11-11T13:36:14  <mcstar>  it is shorthand for 2>&1 |
2011-11-11T13:36:30  <mcstar> thestinger: yep, but i think that is less's fault
2011-11-11T13:36:50  <thestinger> I think 2>&1 will still send stdout
2011-11-11T13:37:07  <a1k0n> yes, that makes stderr go into stdout, and then both get piped
2011-11-11T13:37:10  <thestinger> https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Named_pipe <- just use one of those
2011-11-11T13:37:22  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-11T13:37:24  <a1k0n> spectacular idea.
2011-11-11T13:37:30  <thestinger> I think you can do a fancy swap of stdout and stderr with like 4 redirections but fuck that

2011-11-11T13:44:56  <amstan> ProperChaos: how much does that slow down compilation though
2011-11-11T13:44:59  <amstan> there is a tradeoff
2011-11-11T13:45:13  <ProperChaos> good point, I have no idea
2011-11-11T13:45:14  <amstan> all optimization doesn't necessarly mean faster
2011-11-11T13:45:27  <amstan> might even slow down some code
2011-11-11T13:46:38  <ProperChaos> yeah true, although I think for most people it will help, for me it's almost a 50% improvement

2011-11-11T14:06:05  <conor_f> and Migi32 tyvm :P
2011-11-11T14:06:17  <Migi32> oh, no problem :)
2011-11-11T14:07:12  <Conorach> pretty fun behavior :)
2011-11-11T14:07:19  <conor_f> yeah, effective too
2011-11-11T14:07:30  <conor_f> pity it's not my one :P
2011-11-11T14:07:39  <Antimony> What was purple doing? It didn't seem particularly special to me
2011-11-11T14:08:11  <conor_f> stays static until a number of ants are in the hive
2011-11-11T14:08:30  <conor_f> then moves a bit, then stays static again except with more ants gathering food
2011-11-11T14:08:52  <pairofdice> Encapsulation complete!
2011-11-11T14:09:38  <Antimony> I like my defense strategy the best
2011-11-11T14:09:57  <Antimony> Each turn, calculate the closest possible enemy position and force 1/5th of ants to stay at lesat that close

2011-11-11T14:10:30  <Antimony> It works well as long that you don't get a concerted attack from someone with a numerical advantage
2011-11-11T14:10:39  <conor_f> heh, cool
2011-11-11T14:11:03  <mcstar> what do you do when your number of ants is not divisible with 5?
2011-11-11T14:11:08  <Antimony> but the main advantage is that guards can gather food too as long as no ants are near
2011-11-11T14:11:18  <conor_f> mcstar: just cast it :P

2011-11-11T14:33:46  <LouisMartin> amstan: One could argue that with such results I could use a few manual optimizations, but C#/Mono (CLR) isn't exactly C++ and some things can only be optimized by the compiler. Garbage Collection is terrible thing when ms makes a difference. You can't optimized that well in managed language and you need all the help your compiler offer.

2011-11-11T16:32:18  <Zaphus> plus pathfinding, PW had none - thats a huge amount of time per turn... call it 0.1s per player per turn, thats around 0.5s per turn across the game, for 1000 turns... easily 5 minutes per game eaten by that (if the game lasts) - could be much higher

2011-11-11T17:15:55  <g0llum> just out of curiosity: i play a game. my mu is recalculated. now, do the rankings of all 10k players have to be reassigned, or is there some clever trick to do that on a subset ?
2011-11-11T17:19:17  <nickjohnson> g0llum: The ranking is just a sorted list of skill
2011-11-11T17:19:35  <g0llum> so that's all of 10k
2011-11-11T17:19:57  <Zannick> the algorithm uses everyone as input and generates the skills for everyone
2011-11-11T17:20:06  <nickjohnson> Well, it's all of the ones ranked lower than yours
2011-11-11T17:20:15  <nickjohnson> But that's pretty straightforward to do - just a sort operation
2011-11-11T17:20:36  <Zannick> trueskill
2011-11-11T17:20:44  <g0llum> ah, you can skip the lower ones..
2011-11-11T17:20:58  <Zannick> ...not really?
2011-11-11T17:21:11  <g0llum> more of a database question
2011-11-11T17:21:41  <Zannick> i think it's just using a completely new ranking
2011-11-11T17:22:50  <nickjohnson> You can update incrementally if you use a tree structure
2011-11-11T17:23:04  <nickjohnson> But sorting 10k elements isn't really that hard
2011-11-11T17:23:42  <g0llum> k, seems i'm just scared by numbers here
2011-11-11T17:24:02  <nickjohnson> Much less hard than simulating 10k^2 games :)
2011-11-11T17:24:22  <g0llum> shure ;)
2011-11-11T17:24:54  * avdg wonders if a bot could win by breaking the algorithm
2011-11-11T17:25:10  <avdg> it would be fun
2011-11-11T17:25:27  <nickjohnson> avdg: I don't see how
2011-11-11T17:25:41  <avdg> me neither
2011-11-11T17:25:43  <avdg> just wondering
2011-11-11T17:25:51  <nickjohnson> The inputs are the outcomes of the games, and it's fairly straightforward; the best way to break it would be to consistently win.

2011-11-11T17:38:16  <g0llum> rofer, don#t be t on anything, a 1000*1000 game would trigger epilepsy on the hunan watching it, but it's not impossible..
2011-11-11T17:39:04  <rofer> g0llum: was worried about that, thanks
2011-11-11T17:39:46  <avdg> the spec says games can't be larger than 200x200 (just looked up again to be sure)
2011-11-11T17:40:00  <avdg> http://aichallenge.org/specification.php <- lookup for "map generators"
2011-11-11T17:40:23  <g0llum> the fact, that some organizers are still playing around with mapbuilders should say something, too..
2011-11-11T17:40:52  <avdg> breaking the spec would be the last thing organizers would do ;-)

2011-11-11T17:53:44  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.30714 starting to figure out a way to defend :)
2011-11-11T17:55:53  <g0llum> can't help it, took sides with bugnuts there..
2011-11-11T17:58:24  <g0llum> turn 460 , 1 against 15, still standing
2011-11-11T17:58:54  <thestinger> yeah, he has 64 ants waiting to spawn
2011-11-11T17:59:13  <g0llum> aww, that explains it
2011-11-11T17:59:33  <thestinger> I added code to stop my ants from stepping on a hill with ants spawning out of it, but it's counterproductive in this case b/c he is moving his ants off the hill right away
2011-11-11T17:59:38  <thestinger> so I need to fix that with a heuristic
2011-11-11T18:00:05  <g0llum> explain ;)
2011-11-11T18:00:29  <thestinger> well, if you step onto their hill and they spawn an ant, your ant dies and you don't raze the hill
2011-11-11T18:00:43  <thestinger> but if they immediately move the ant off the hill I think you can still raze it by moving onto it
2011-11-11T18:00:53  <thestinger> i.e. they cooperate with the razing
2011-11-11T18:01:23  <thestinger> he's moving off the hill right away and colliding with my ants, so my current tactic of waiting for the hill to finish spawning ants failed

2011-11-11T18:03:04  <g0llum> niether you or him know, that there are 64 more inside that hill
2011-11-11T18:03:41  <thestinger> yeah, but atm I try to surround the hill, and I won't move onto it if an ant spawned there last turn basically
2011-11-11T18:04:11  <thestinger> if you zoom in and step through turn-by-turn you can see he's stepping off the hill and colliding with my ants rather than staying there

2011-11-11T18:12:59  <thestinger> maybe the dead ants thing could help with this...
2011-11-11T18:13:50  <g0llum> maybe you need a secondary mayor in psycology for that
2011-11-11T18:14:10  <g0llum> or just a lucky hand
2011-11-11T18:14:56  <thestinger> I think you get told about dead ants in a tile
2011-11-11T18:15:09  <thestinger> so I could check and see if there are newly dead enemies in the 4 squares around the hill
2011-11-11T18:15:49  <g0llum> like, front is coming closer ?
2011-11-11T18:16:20  <thestinger> well, I need to know if I should surround the hill and wait for it to drain or move onto it right away
2011-11-11T18:16:31  <thestinger> if they're leaving their newly spawned ants on the hill, surrounding it is best
2011-11-11T18:16:47  <thestinger> if they're doing kamikaze collision attacks, moving onto it right away will work
2011-11-11T18:17:08  <thestinger> and hopefully their tactic doesn't change :P

2011-11-11T20:16:43  <janzert> yeah, eventually moving to cpu time would be nice although too late for this contest and we need someone to write the code to switch over to it. Basically we're still on wall time because no one has written the cpu time tracking
2011-11-11T20:16:59  <BenJackson_> Ok, what would be the deadline for the next contest?
2011-11-11T20:17:30  <BenJackson_> so reviewing my recent losses I just realized I may have lost this replay on the very first turn:  http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=83511&user=3473
2011-11-11T20:17:33  <janzert> there are no plans regarding the next one yet, but I would say a minimum of 3 months after this one
2011-11-11T20:17:51  <janzert> more probably a 6 months to a year
2011-11-11T20:17:59  <BenJackson_> there's food right by the hill and I step away
2011-11-11T20:18:11  <janzert> oops :(
2011-11-11T20:20:14  <BenJackson_> at least it's easy to fix!
2011-11-11T20:20:54  <janzert> yeah, and should help any other situation where food spawns right next to an ant
2011-11-11T20:21:20  <BenJackson_> I probably have a specific exception for that which was just wrong thinking
2011-11-11T20:22:23  <BenJackson_> oh ho, I know what it is
2011-11-11T20:22:31  <BenJackson_> my old nemesis treating my own hills as impassible to avoid stepping on them

2011-11-11T21:39:25  <nickjohnson> Python log messages do, and I've tried explicitly setting the output writer as stderr, too.
2011-11-11T21:39:37  <BenJackson_> you have to pass -e to playgame.py
2011-11-11T21:39:43  <BenJackson_> otherwise it throws away stderr

2011-11-11T21:46:55  <nickjohnson> ah, thanks
2011-11-11T21:51:58  <nickjohnson> This is perplexing: it's crashing because I'm trying to move an ant onto a square occupied by another ant
2011-11-11T21:52:09  <nickjohnson> but that should never happen - I'm checking if the square is safe first
2011-11-11T21:52:43  <Extrarius> nickjohnson: what about moving two ants to the same square? you sure that isn't happening?
2011-11-11T21:53:12  <nickjohnson> Extrarius: The Go starter kit has a 'SafeDestination' function that checks for ants; I'm skipping any squares for which it returns False
2011-11-11T21:53:31  <nickjohnson> On top of that, I've seen frames where it let me step into an occupied square without warning or complaint
