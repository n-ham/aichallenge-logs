2012-02-11T13:12:42  <amstan> we need a framework first
2012-02-11T13:13:51  <delt0r_> ? what was wrong with the last one?
2012-02-11T13:13:56  <delt0r_> seem to work fine? no?
2012-02-11T13:14:03  <amstan> not really
2012-02-11T13:14:15  <delt0r_> ic... what was the problem?
2012-02-11T13:14:22  <amstan> problems
2012-02-11T13:14:24  <amstan> lots of them
2012-02-11T13:14:27  <delt0r_> lol
2012-02-11T13:14:44  <amstan> we were due for another framework before ants
2012-02-11T13:14:59  <delt0r_> isn't that just the way things this sort of size, with the resources you have, sort of go anyway...

2012-02-11T13:15:23  <amstan> we barely had enough cpu resources
2012-02-11T13:15:35  <delt0r_> its not like you can sink a million into some internal infrastructure project
2012-02-11T13:15:50  <delt0r_> yea.. that is a problem... i have a suggestion...
2012-02-11T13:16:31  <delt0r_> at least for the non compete games... the framework could permit a seti online type thing where people can donate time on there machines...

2012-02-11T13:17:11  <delt0r_> cheating, supporting N+1 languages etc make it hard however
2012-02-11T13:17:13  <pairofdice> that's difficult to set up
2012-02-11T13:17:42  <delt0r_> yea
2012-02-11T13:17:50  <pairofdice> I don't even see how it could work
2012-02-11T13:18:23  <delt0r_> so a live DVD of the required linux may work better... i know a few of us could provide some cpu power... uni teams should be able to
2012-02-11T13:18:43  <delt0r_> still hit and miss on how many would come to the party
2012-02-11T13:19:35  <delt0r_> but we just can't assume we will get money to burn so i can't really see a better way... and sponsorship would require some serious investment of time from someone...
2012-02-11T13:19:39  <amstan> that's really hard to make secure
2012-02-11T13:19:42  <amstan> and it's not really possible
2012-02-11T13:19:55  <amstan> we have the money
2012-02-11T13:19:58  <delt0r_> hence the idea that it would not be for final ranks etc
2012-02-11T13:20:01  <amstan> we just don't have good money handling abilities
2012-02-11T13:20:02  <delt0r_> really?
2012-02-11T13:20:05  <amstan> we're working on fixing that
2012-02-11T13:20:10  <delt0r_> ahhh
2012-02-11T13:20:28  <delt0r_> hence the time investment from someone...
2012-02-11T13:20:30  <amstan> people were throwing money at us last time, but we couldn't accept donations because we don't really have a nonprofit setup
2012-02-11T13:20:32  <delt0r_> not easy....
2012-02-11T13:20:42  <amstan> yes
2012-02-11T13:20:52  <amstan> and it's a pretty full time job to do anything for this contest
2012-02-11T13:20:56  <delt0r_> can be tricky to get non profit status --at least in the US
2012-02-11T13:21:01  <delt0r_> yea
2012-02-11T13:22:02  <amstan> and picking the game is the last thing to do
2012-02-11T13:22:20  <amstan> we don't want a bunch of people being familiar with the game months before it's started
2012-02-11T13:22:22  <delt0r_> well for many its the only thing they are going to do...
2012-02-11T13:22:31  <delt0r_> meh
2012-02-11T13:22:46  <delt0r_> that kind of "they had a head start" is so totally lame
2012-02-11T13:23:02  <amstan> well
2012-02-11T13:23:04  <amstan> we have a choice
2012-02-11T13:23:11  <delt0r_> we going to penalize older folk who have had longer to get better at programming?

2012-02-11T13:28:24  <valydo> hey guys, sorry to interrupt. Some friends and I would like to mirror the aichallenge website for a contest between us. Do you think this is feasible using just one machine and no Amazon cloud stuff, using the github repo?
2012-02-11T13:28:37  <amstan> valydo: sure
2012-02-11T13:28:46  <delt0r_> how well does python do "servlets" or web pages?
2012-02-11T13:28:57  <valydo> cool, thanks :)
2012-02-11T13:29:01  <amstan> delt0r_: see django
2012-02-11T13:29:02  <antimatroidl> valydo: you could always just download the tcp server and host that?
2012-02-11T13:29:08  <amstan> valydo: or that ^
2012-02-11T13:29:19  <amstan> valydo: it's easier to do tcp
2012-02-11T13:29:26  <antimatroidl> i managed to get it running on my computer a while ago and i have almost no idea with that stuff
2012-02-11T13:29:30  <valydo> but that doesn't have the nice matching
2012-02-11T13:29:38  <antimatroidl> how many of you are there? :P
2012-02-11T13:29:39  <valydo> afaik
2012-02-11T13:29:50  <valydo> we hope to get 20
2012-02-11T13:30:26  <antimatroidl> you could look at how the matching is done and try changing it, but that might not be easier anymore :P
2012-02-11T13:30:54  <amstan> valydo: afaik the tcp thing still uses trueskill
2012-02-11T13:31:08  <amstan> valydo: the only annoying thing is that you have to stay connected with your bot instance to play
2012-02-11T13:31:22  <amstan> valydo: but feel free to try the  main site too
2012-02-11T13:31:35  <amstan> valydo: there's some guides on the forums about them

2012-02-11T13:36:43  <mcstar> obviously emacs
2012-02-11T13:36:58  <mcstar> indents very nicely
2012-02-11T13:37:36  <mcstar> there is leksah for a full haskell ide written in haskell
2012-02-11T13:37:51  <amstan> well.. i would like to continue using kate
2012-02-11T13:38:02  <amstan> but like.. this is a showstopper
2012-02-11T13:38:23  <amstan> you know how you're supposed to align the next line under the if
2012-02-11T13:38:33  <amstan> kate proceeded to use a bunch of tabs to do that
2012-02-11T13:38:36  <mcstar> what is a showstopper?
2012-02-11T13:38:46  <amstan> like.. i don't have anything against tabs
2012-02-11T13:38:51  <amstan> i like using tabs for indenting
2012-02-11T13:38:54  <amstan> but this is alignment
2012-02-11T13:39:01  <mcstar> haskell prefers spaces
2012-02-11T13:39:01  <amstan> you should never use tabs in that situation
2012-02-11T13:39:06  <mcstar> and it makes sense
2012-02-11T13:39:15  <jmcarthur> i use emacs
2012-02-11T13:39:50  <jmcarthur> kate doesn't have a setting for tabs vs. spaces?
2012-02-11T13:39:55  <amstan> it does
2012-02-11T13:40:14  <amstan> but when i pick tabs, i don't want it to use tabs everywhere, it's always tabs for indenting and spaces for aligning
2012-02-11T13:40:37  <mcstar> amstan: when you use emacs' tab, it cycles through the possible logical indentation levels
2012-02-11T13:40:42  <mcstar> it is very handy
2012-02-11T13:40:53  <mcstar> and uses only spaces
2012-02-11T13:41:01  <amstan> i don't like using only spaces
2012-02-11T13:41:15  <mcstar> why not? in haskell?
2012-02-11T13:41:34  <amstan> do you have any kind of indentation?
2012-02-11T13:41:39  <mcstar> with spaces, formatting stays the same, no matter what editor you use
2012-02-11T13:41:45  <mcstar> a tab-width can vary
2012-02-11T13:41:52  <amstan> yes, as it should be
2012-02-11T13:41:55  <amstan> so you can adjust you code
2012-02-11T13:42:12  <mcstar> but a written piece of haskell should not depend on the tab-width setting

2012-02-11T13:46:55  <mcstar> the code from reddit in my emacs
2012-02-11T13:48:47  <amstan> mcstar: can you make it display the tabs?
2012-02-11T13:48:58  <mcstar> there are no tabs
2012-02-11T13:49:05  <amstan> ...
2012-02-11T13:49:09  <amstan> that's not what i want
2012-02-11T13:49:29  <mcstar> i dont understand why you want tabs in your code, sorry
2012-02-11T13:50:09  <amstan> because that's what tabs are designed to do, intend stuff
2012-02-11T13:50:18  <mcstar> indent
2012-02-11T13:50:31  <mcstar> tabs were supposed to save space
2012-02-11T13:50:34  <mcstar> literally
2012-02-11T13:51:06  <mcstar> anyway, when you edit in emacs, you are not supposed to delete whitespace
2012-02-11T13:51:14  <amstan> ?
2012-02-11T13:51:15  <mcstar> so it doest matter if its space or tab

2012-02-11T13:51:32  <amstan> so how do you end a block in python then?
2012-02-11T13:51:40  <amstan> you're inside an if
2012-02-11T13:51:42  <amstan> you press enter
2012-02-11T13:51:48  <amstan> you end up on the next line with same indent level
2012-02-11T13:51:51  <amstan> so.. still inside the if
2012-02-11T13:51:54  <amstan> how do you leave the if?
2012-02-11T13:52:04  <mcstar> no, you end of on the beginning of the line
2012-02-11T13:52:11  <mcstar> probably, i dont edit much python code
2012-02-11T13:52:13  <amstan> oh god
2012-02-11T13:52:16  <amstan> that's ew
2012-02-11T13:52:26  <mcstar> but a tab brings you about the next indentation level
2012-02-11T13:52:36  <mcstar> just like slime/common lisp mode
2012-02-11T13:52:47  <mcstar> you get used to it in a minute
2012-02-11T13:53:14  <mcstar> amstan: a tab indents the line
2012-02-11T13:53:23  <mcstar> it doesnt insert any character inside a line
2012-02-11T13:53:40  <mcstar> so you can indent a line standing on the end of it too
2012-02-11T13:53:46  <mcstar> just by pressing tab
2012-02-11T13:54:05  <mcstar> in recent editors it is called "align"
2012-02-11T13:55:02  <mcstar> amstan: hah, its a joke what kate doest to that code
2012-02-11T13:55:16  <amstan> mcstar: ?
2012-02-11T13:55:27  <amstan> you could go to spaces mode, and it'll be to your liking
2012-02-11T13:55:33  <mcstar> no
2012-02-11T13:55:34  <amstan> but i use tabs, and it breaks
2012-02-11T13:55:47  <mcstar> you should try emacs, and be amazed how good it is

2012-02-11T15:06:15  <jmcarthur> sorry i missed that whole conversation. reading back over it now
2012-02-11T15:06:44  <amstan> jmcarthur: tldr: i switched to vim so i can get the indentation stuff going properly
2012-02-11T15:06:52  <amstan> jmcarthur: and when i get comfortable i'll learn haskell
2012-02-11T15:07:01  <chris_0076> haskell is fun
2012-02-11T15:07:29  <chris_0076> more like writing math problems than programming
2012-02-11T15:08:00  <amstan> chris_0076: you should do you fractals in haskell instead of messing around with python+multiprocessing
2012-02-11T15:08:04  <amstan> that code was yucky
2012-02-11T15:08:23  <jmcarthur> the emacs haskell-mode's tab stuff is nice because it just toggles among whatever valid indentations there are (each with its own meaning in haskell, of course). you don't really have to find the correct location yourself
2012-02-11T15:08:40  <jmcarthur> well, you do, but emacs guides you to it
2012-02-11T15:09:01  <amstan> yeah, but i really want to use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment
2012-02-11T15:09:15  <jmcarthur> in haskell at least i highly recommend against that
2012-02-11T15:09:30  <jmcarthur> tabs are statically interpreted as 8 spaces anyway
2012-02-11T15:09:35  <jmcarthur> (as they are supposed to be!)
2012-02-11T15:09:40  <amstan> yeah, so there shouldn't be any issue
2012-02-11T15:10:19  <jmcarthur> the difference between indentation and alignment is kind of fuzzy in haskell
2012-02-11T15:10:24  <jmcarthur> moreso than in python
2012-02-11T15:10:52  <jmcarthur> consider a do block where the first line is on the same line as the "do"
2012-02-11T15:11:46  <amstan> jmcarthur: i got as far as the if statment in the tutorial, and then i got really annoyed at my editor
2012-02-11T15:12:02  <amstan> so.. not sure what do is
2012-02-11T15:12:13  <jmcarthur> a different example then
2012-02-11T15:12:29  <jmcarthur> i'll use hpaste for this, so hold on a sec
2012-02-11T15:12:42  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-02-11T15:13:33  <jmcarthur> consider this: http://hpaste.org/new
2012-02-11T15:13:55  <jmcarthur> the a b and c must be aligned
2012-02-11T15:14:05  <jmcarthur> regardless of the indentation level of the let
2012-02-11T15:14:36  <jmcarthur> the let could also be a part of a larger expression with its own alignment requirements
2012-02-11T15:15:01  <jmcarthur> the discipline of distinguishing tabs and spaces for such stuff becomes very tedious
2012-02-11T15:15:35  <jmcarthur> and you basically *have* to set your editor such that a tab is displayed as 8 spaces, since it's meaningful
2012-02-11T15:16:21  <jmcarthur> it's possible that there are ways around it, but that's even more trouble
2012-02-11T15:19:47  <mcstar> jmcarthur: your paste is empty
2012-02-11T15:21:39  <mcstar> i just want to add, that any new indentation (even 1 space) opens a new block, and tab is too rigid, emacs aligns better, to syntactic elements, wo using tabs
2012-02-11T15:22:24  <mcstar> (i dont think vim supports that kind of in-line indentation though, which is very nice)
