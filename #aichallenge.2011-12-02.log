2011-12-02T00:21:59  <thestinger> lots of the people on fluxid's tcp server seem to use like 4s a turn now :\
2011-12-02T00:22:06  <thestinger> games are taking forever
2011-12-02T00:25:59  <Kommander> i just realized my combat code is making my bot worse. I am losing to HunterBot in the default test :/
2011-12-02T00:26:08  <AntDroid> would that mean that skils on tcp server are overrated compared to skills on the aichallenge due to more time for their bots?

2011-12-02T00:29:44  <antimatroid> i sped mine up last night
2011-12-02T00:29:54  <antimatroid> going through and working out what's taking the longest
2011-12-02T00:29:55  <AntDroid> maybe i should implement some sort of search also with alpha-beta/negascout, is anyone using them?
2011-12-02T00:30:13  <antimatroid> not sure how you'd use alpha beta for searching?
2011-12-02T00:30:26  <antimatroid> i use a* while collecting food but just variations of bfs otherwise
2011-12-02T00:30:56  <AntDroid> it's just mini-max with a smaller branching factor
2011-12-02T00:31:42  <ChrisH_> AntDroid: I use A-B pruning in combat calcs.
2011-12-02T00:32:11  <AntDroid> problem is that the branching factor in this game is too big, maybe if you could prune some of the ants useless moves the branching factor would go sown
2011-12-02T00:32:26  <ChrisH_> yes

2011-12-02T00:33:59  <ChrisH_> but i don't search very deep
2011-12-02T00:34:22  <ChrisH_> because I haven't squeezed enough time out of it yet
2011-12-02T00:34:42  <ChrisH_> and I'm not sure how much more I can squeeze out
2011-12-02T00:34:47  <AntDroid> ok. i'm thinking of using number of squares controlled in the map as score. maybe this way it will deprive the enemy with space. do you do iterative deepening?
2011-12-02T00:34:49  <antimatroid> i changed my bot last night to only do closest path info for stuff like ants/hills etc. up to a max length
2011-12-02T00:35:04  <antimatroid> i want my bot to be able to run on 300x300

2011-12-02T00:36:17  <ChrisH_> AntDroid: I only use mini-max for ants engaged in combat, and I score primarily based on how many ants each side has in the combat.
2011-12-02T00:36:37  <antimatroid> anyone know how long set up time is on the server?
2011-12-02T00:36:43  <ChrisH_> 3000ms
2011-12-02T00:36:46  <antimatroid> cool
2011-12-02T00:36:49  <antimatroid> i'm still under 1000
2011-12-02T00:36:53  <antimatroid> but just wanted to make sure
2011-12-02T00:37:19  <antimatroid> under 1000 for 300x300 that is
2011-12-02T00:37:31  <antimatroid> i turn my grid into a graph during that turn
2011-12-02T00:37:48  <ChrisH_> I actually timed out on that in testing working on my last version, but it was an easy fix to cut my setup time in half, I had never optimized it until then.
2011-12-02T00:38:11  <antimatroid> yikes, what the hell are you doing :p
2011-12-02T00:38:41  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-02T00:39:02  <AntDroid> ChrisH: thanks. gives me some idea. my problem now is how to determine if an ant or group of ants is to be included for computation of combat . i currently only use ants within attack radius + 2
2011-12-02T00:39:05  <ChrisH_> I do a lot of caching of attackable, and visible cells for each map cell up front to avoid doing that over and over during each turn.
2011-12-02T00:39:20  <ChrisH_> AntDroid: that's pretty standard
2011-12-02T00:39:22  <bmh> AntDroid: why +2? I was only going to do +1
2011-12-02T00:39:39  <pairofdice> Oh, 85% from latest ai class homework, I was expecting somehting like 50%
2011-12-02T00:39:56  <bmh> pairofdice: do they do automated grading?
2011-12-02T00:39:58  <ChrisH_> bmh: because both ants can move towards each other
2011-12-02T00:40:06  <AntDroid> bmh: in case enemy ants go into your direction also. the ants in the +2 radius will get into you attack radius
2011-12-02T00:40:07  <bmh> ChrisH_: duh! :)
2011-12-02T00:40:12  <pairofdice> Yeah
2011-12-02T00:40:56  <AntDroid> ChrisH: when do you do the caching? at the start of the game?
2011-12-02T00:40:59  <antimatroid> i don't like people's +1 things
2011-12-02T00:41:02  <antimatroid> it's not quite right
2011-12-02T00:41:15  <antimatroid> or +2
2011-12-02T00:41:22  <ChrisH_> AntDroid: yes, in turn 0 after you get the board dimensions before the game begins
2011-12-02T00:41:29  <antimatroid> eg. a%..b and a..%b can't land in battle next turn
2011-12-02T00:41:45  <antimatroid> it's worth getting the border of attack and vision too imo
2011-12-02T00:41:51  <antimatroid> the translation values that is
2011-12-02T00:42:05  <bmh> antimatroid: sure, take that into account in your model?
2011-12-02T00:42:11  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: or do you get the translation and attack locations for each location?
2011-12-02T00:42:24  <antimatroid> bmh: yes i wont put those ants in the same battle partition
2011-12-02T00:42:25  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: yes
2011-12-02T00:42:37  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: how large is that? :P
2011-12-02T00:42:42  <ChrisH_> and I update them to remove invalid ones as I see water
2011-12-02T00:42:48  <antimatroid> yeah i do that
2011-12-02T00:43:02  <antimatroid> well, for land neighbours
2011-12-02T00:43:04  <bmh> ah, I'm not going to attempt to do a partition. I'm feeling clock pressure, but I'm going to take a shot at a sampling based approach
2011-12-02T00:43:25  <antimatroid> i just went for fully sized partitions and quicker combat code
2011-12-02T00:43:27  <bmh> at least this will be over before Christmas
2011-12-02T00:43:34  <ChrisH_> well it depends on map size, but even a 200x200 map is not huge
2011-12-02T00:44:03  <antimatroid> i would have liked to bomb vision information with water blocking in some instances, but it's really slow
2011-12-02T00:44:09  <antimatroid> but your way might make that possible
2011-12-02T00:45:07  <ChrisH_> I use that a lot for exploration planning
2011-12-02T00:45:25  <antimatroid> i wanted to :P
2011-12-02T00:45:29  <antimatroid> and now might :P
2011-12-02T00:46:25  <ChrisH_> so, 177 visible cells from each cell times 40k for a 200x200, comes to ~7M entries max, if you store 4byte ints, that's 28MB,
2011-12-02T00:46:55  <antimatroid> i take it you aren't passing states around for your game tree? :P
2011-12-02T00:48:30  <ChrisH_> not copies of full board states, no way, there is one master copy of the cached indexes, and a point to that is passed everywhere.

2011-12-02T03:48:24  <janzert> I really don't understand why he sent the group of ants on the upper right of the map back past his own hill to attack instead of taking the short route that he had definitely already seen

2011-12-02T04:07:21  <Ashoka> janzert : I meant the game was abruptly ended at just 431 turns. when one player was moving on and close towards the hill as well. what's the harm allowing games to continue a bit longer in cases like these...
2011-12-02T04:09:33  <antimatroid> time is the harm
2011-12-02T04:09:44  <antimatroid> the bot should have won the game way before then
2011-12-02T04:10:36  <Ashoka> antimatroid : no. from turn 300 onwards, player1 was clearly marching towards the hill and almost reached there with a big army by 431. it would have been finished in abt 10-15 more turns

2011-12-02T08:57:01  <george> hi, about map symmetry...
2011-12-02T08:58:09  <george> will/is the python code in branch:  amstam_mapgen      /ants/mapgen/      be used for the final contest (with different seeds of course)   ?
2011-12-02T08:58:55  <george> (i'm trying to take advantage of symmetries, and the code seems to be the (only/best) documentation ...
2011-12-02T08:59:29  <george> ... so i wanted to know whether the code is now fixed?  )
2011-12-02T08:59:39  <george> ie will not change
2011-12-02T08:59:48  <Antimony> just assume any symmetry cna hpapen
2011-12-02T09:00:08  <george> Anti -
2011-12-02T09:00:23  <george> for all i know they might use Penrose Tilings or something  :/
2011-12-02T09:00:41  <george> i am not going to write code for every possible symmetry if i can help it
2011-12-02T09:02:45  <george> i was reading the webpage, but the info there wasn't definitive - mentioned 'blocks' for eg the food.  but some of the translation maps are not like that.
2011-12-02T09:03:21  <george> which is when amstam suggested i read the python code
2011-12-02T09:04:14  <Antimony> there's only 8 possible symmetries
2011-12-02T09:07:30  <george> hm.  not sure that helps me.  but thanks for the reply.
2011-12-02T09:07:40  <george> eg 2-4-8 fold rotations
2011-12-02T09:08:00  <george> are presumably possible on grid?

2011-12-02T09:08:52  <george> but i'f they are not implemented, then i want to know that - allows me to eliminate possibilities earlier in the game, and so know the map sooner
2011-12-02T09:08:52  <george> etc
2011-12-02T09:08:56  <QuirionPT> isn't it that from the perspective of each player the map has to look exactly the same?
2011-12-02T09:09:07  <george> yes, sure
2011-12-02T09:09:19  <QuirionPT> so there are only 4 possibilities, right?
2011-12-02T09:10:08  <george> well.  eg do we have symmetry lines running between squares (yes, it seems)
2011-12-02T09:10:18  <george> and also through squares?  i dont know
2011-12-02T09:10:28  <george> ...
2011-12-02T09:10:44  <george> i'm just trying to find what the rules are.
2011-12-02T09:10:58  <george> the webpage gives info that seems to be innaccurate
2011-12-02T09:11:13  <george> which is why i read code and ask if code is what organisers will use.
2011-12-02T09:13:22  <Antimony> anything that passes  the symmetry test in the engine is acceptable
2011-12-02T09:13:28  <Antimony> you can't assume the mapgens will stay the same
2011-12-02T09:16:15  <george> hi Antimony.  thanks.  the 'engine'  is mapgen.py?   (btw, am i right in assuming your are an organiser?)
2011-12-02T09:16:40  <Antimony> no
2011-12-02T09:16:46  <Antimony> I'm not an organizer
2011-12-02T09:17:01  <Antimony> but that's what they said before
2011-12-02T09:20:55  <george> ok, thanks.
2011-12-02T09:21:39  <george> i'll try and ask amstam when he's about, to be sure.

2011-12-02T16:53:17  <cowbandit> currently i'm making a list of all unvisible tiles and removing them when they become visible
2011-12-02T16:53:32  <cowbandit> and once that list is depleted i just reset the list
2011-12-02T16:53:39  <cowbandit> however i feel that I don't get enough spread that way

2011-12-02T17:45:34  <rwest_> better to keep an array of the map
2011-12-02T17:45:40  <rwest_> cowbandit: ^^
2011-12-02T17:45:55  <rwest_> increment all unvisible tiles per turn, 0 out visibles
2011-12-02T17:46:05  <rwest_> weight locations to explore based on the map
2011-12-02T17:46:13  <cowbandit> ahh i see
2011-12-02T17:46:33  <cowbandit> hmm i like that solution
2011-12-02T17:46:50  <cowbandit> now it will just be implementing it.. T_T
2011-12-02T17:47:05  <rwest_> makes it so you want to explore tiles you have seen least recent
2011-12-02T17:47:20  <cowbandit> wait so should i increment a tile
2011-12-02T17:47:26  <cowbandit> each time it's seen by a different ant?
2011-12-02T17:47:30  <rwest_> no

2011-12-02T17:47:41  <rwest_> set to 0 when seen
2011-12-02T17:47:44  <rwest_> so every turn
2011-12-02T17:47:47  <cowbandit> ohh
2011-12-02T17:47:58  <rwest_> so say you haven't seen a tile for 100 turns
2011-12-02T17:48:05  <rwest_> it would be weighted by 100
2011-12-02T17:48:15  <cowbandit> ok i see what you're saying
2011-12-02T17:50:39  <g0llum> if you could not see an enemy hill there 100 turns ago, why go back  ?
2011-12-02T17:50:52  <rwest_> g0llum: food

2011-12-02T17:51:45  <rwest_> g0llum: but this increments from the start of the game, so odds are if something is the highest value, you haven't seen it yet
2011-12-02T17:52:06  <rwest_> otherwise you have seen the whole map and should be killing the hill

2011-12-02T18:05:57  <katebus> sure, nice idea
2011-12-02T18:06:13  <katebus> so there are many ideas for well leveled exploration
2011-12-02T18:06:26  <katebus> now i have to pick one and implement
2011-12-02T18:07:50  <katebus> my bot does not explore yet... well it does some random stuff, but my ants gets blocked by my other ants
2011-12-02T18:08:08  <katebus> do you have problems with ants blocking each other?
2011-12-02T18:08:45  <rwest_> no, but I don't use any real navigation yet
2011-12-02T18:08:48  <rwest_> just an influence map
2011-12-02T18:09:02  <katebus> I've read about flocks, and so on... but it does not fit my solution, at least not yet, maybe I should drop that starter bot and write it from scratch
2011-12-02T18:09:22  <katebus> ohh, the influence, I see that this may be smarter
2011-12-02T18:09:35  <rwest_> I don't think any of the top maps use it
2011-12-02T18:09:41  <rwest_> at least not exclusively

2011-12-02T18:09:58  <katebus> I am still thinking
2011-12-02T18:10:09  <katebus> maybe i should stop and just try to do something
2011-12-02T18:10:47  <cwc> I keep a list of where each ant will end up, then if the policy says to move to an inhabitted space I chose a different direction (or don't move if no possible choice). works alright, very rare do ants bump into each other
2011-12-02T18:11:33  <katebus> i meant that i have a few ants, lets say 4 blocking 10 other ants - it works like a wall
2011-12-02T18:11:46  <katebus> i do redirect too, but then it looks like a chaos
2011-12-02T18:12:03  <cwc> the question is why are those 4 ants not moving
2011-12-02T18:12:08  <Antimony> yeah
2011-12-02T18:12:31  <katebus> because they want to go into some other direction, and the decision changes with every turn

2011-12-02T18:13:03  <cwc> ya, you need a relatively stable policy map
2011-12-02T18:13:06  <rwest_> I have that problem occasionally, but more ants coming in the area usually fixes the problem rather than worsen it

2011-12-02T18:17:27  <cwc> I get back and forth action sometimes, really bad on some maps. probably because of two many conflicting goals
2011-12-02T18:20:00  <Antimony> ug, I need combat badly
2011-12-02T18:20:09  <katebus> yes, deciding between many local goals sometimes makes the bot stupid, the cost changes with every turn, I wonder if we can easily try to compute some global cost function - for the whole map
2011-12-02T18:20:46  <Antimony> why do you have so many unstable goals?

2011-12-02T18:21:03  <IU-YO> hows it going
2011-12-02T18:21:39  <rwest_> Antimony: It's not so much goals are unstable, but turn by turn goals may get different weights based on map state
2011-12-02T18:22:02  <cwc> it's not local goals for me I don't think. I think it is when I know about two hills, maybe I need to focus on one target at a time
2011-12-02T18:22:25  <Minthos> I have that problem when I send many ants to the nearest something, and that something can appear or disappear frequently
2011-12-02T18:22:28  <Fluxid> use weights for each kind of goal
2011-12-02T18:22:34  <Minthos> such as exploration points and enemy ants
2011-12-02T18:23:03  <rwest_> Fluxid: this is where my influence map falls short, I blend my goals
2011-12-02T18:23:09  <Minthos> but I have solutions, I just need to find the right balance
2011-12-02T18:23:51  <katebus> in my case it is because I just started with the starter package from java tutorial, and there the ants select the targets, while preferably the ant should be assigned to targets,
2011-12-02T18:24:19  <katebus> the resulting solution is suboptimal and unstable, I may have much to improve
2011-12-02T18:25:29  <cwc> not sure about the java starter package, but sounds like you are doing too much fine work. I think the best solution is to define global policies that apply to all ants (or subsections of ants)

2011-12-02T23:33:28  <thestinger> it isn't a vector of bools, it's a bunch of bitfields
2011-12-02T23:33:39  <antimatroid> yeah i know it's different, that's a pita too
2011-12-02T23:33:42  <thestinger> never use vector<bool>
2011-12-02T23:33:45  <antimatroid> but i expected it to be faster
2011-12-02T23:33:45  <thestinger> use vector<uint8_t>

2011-12-02T23:35:54  <thestinger> uint8_t will work fine, but I wouldn't be surprised if unsigned/int are still faster
2011-12-02T23:36:25  <thestinger> no point using 4x/8x the space than uint8_t just for 2% speed or whatever though :)
2011-12-02T23:37:06  * antimatroid tests what's fastest
2011-12-02T23:37:20  <antimatroid> when you're searching how do you mark what's searched?
2011-12-02T23:37:29  <antimatroid> i figure these are faster than a set?
2011-12-02T23:37:42  <antimatroid> but it depends on the board size i guess
2011-12-02T23:37:44  <thestinger> oh, for BFS?
2011-12-02T23:37:54  <antimatroid> yeah, or some other kind of search
2011-12-02T23:38:07  <thestinger> well most of my searches just mark distances, so I just compare the new distance I would set that tile to with the old value
2011-12-02T23:38:39  <thestinger> for the ones that need to track visited I use std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> atm
2011-12-02T23:38:58  <antimatroid> to mark path distance isn't that essentially the same thing?

2011-12-02T23:39:27  <antimatroid> and you can't search off euclidean or manhatten
2011-12-02T23:39:31  <antimatroid> because that wouldn't work :P
2011-12-02T23:39:32  <thestinger> well, since I'm already marking path distances it means I don't need a second 2d vector for marking which are visited
2011-12-02T23:39:38  <antimatroid> yeah sure
2011-12-02T23:39:49  <thestinger> for the radius stuff I just paint it on with offsets
2011-12-02T23:40:12  <antimatroid> yeah i have translation values for attack, attackBorder, view and viewBorder
2011-12-02T23:40:21  <thestinger> std::unordered_set<Location> might actually be faster for the few searches I do without making distance maps though
2011-12-02T23:40:40  <antimatroid> but i want to store in each location the possible locations an ant residing in this turn it could battle next turn
2011-12-02T23:40:42  <thestinger> since my hash function basically cheats and there will never be collisions :)
2011-12-02T23:40:50  <antimatroid> so i don't actually need to do those calculations when i make my battle partitions
2011-12-02T23:41:31  <thestinger> I bet a 2D array is as fast you can get though
2011-12-02T23:42:01  <thestinger> a 2D std::vector probably has a lot of overhead since you have a vector of pointers to vectors, when you really don't ever resize them
2011-12-02T23:42:53  <thestinger> the good old 'row * cols + col' trick works well though for using a 1D array
2011-12-02T23:43:15  <thestinger> I'm way too lazy to optimize like that though
2011-12-02T23:43:28  <antimatroid> I could probably just use an array
2011-12-02T23:43:39  <antimatroid> although i might not get indexing how i'd like then
2011-12-02T23:43:49  <antimatroid> i'll update the matrix class to use a 1d vector
2011-12-02T23:44:01  <antimatroid> would templates be slow?
2011-12-02T23:44:12  <thestinger> no, templates don't add overhead
2011-12-02T23:44:12  <antimatroid> ie. should i just write a separate matrix class for anything i might use it for
2011-12-02T23:44:14  <antimatroid> cool
2011-12-02T23:44:16  <thestinger> they're compile-time code generation
2011-12-02T23:44:40  <antimatroid> i don't know very much about behind the scenes stuff, i just learn how to do what i need and leave it at that usually :P
2011-12-02T23:45:02  <thestinger> like template<typename T> T min(T a, T b); will compile to the same thing as defining min for each type
2011-12-02T23:45:23  <antimatroid> awesome, templates can be awesome
2011-12-02T23:45:31  <antimatroid> i do wish c++ had type classes and variables though
2011-12-02T23:45:36  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-02T23:45:52  <thestinger> 'auto' in C++11 is nice though
2011-12-02T23:45:57  <antimatroid> what's that?
2011-12-02T23:46:04  <thestinger> local type inference
2011-12-02T23:46:52  <thestinger> std::vector<uint_8>::const_iterator it = vec.begin(); -> auto it = vec.cbegin();

2011-12-02T23:59:39  <a1k0n> well sure but i mean. to implement it in the first place unless you just have vectors of vectors, you need to emulate that somehow
