2010-12-20T00:23:13  <antimatroid1> i might write a better bot to see what some cooler games look like
2010-12-20T00:23:31  <antimatroid1> or maybe just do rage bot first
2010-12-20T00:25:15  <Frontier> please make a rage bot. once the game has two 'characters' playing it will be much more interesting
2010-12-20T00:26:50  <antimatroid1> yeah okay, rage bot is easy
2010-12-20T00:27:12  <antimatroid1> i really need to fix the engine issue with memory
2010-12-20T00:27:22  <antimatroid1> i can't do games of more than like 150 turns
2010-12-20T00:27:29  <antimatroid1> but i can't for the life of me work out the issue
2010-12-20T00:32:28  <Frontier> How about making all the objects that might eat memory local in some function. When you return back from the function call to your main() the memory gets cleared it it is still claimed by those objects. By making the objects global one by one you can see which is the problem.
2010-12-20T00:32:41  <Frontier> Would that work?
2010-12-20T00:33:31  <antimatroid1> hmmm maybe
2010-12-20T00:33:45  <antimatroid1> i tried commenting out sections last night, and think i've reduced it to my get moves function
2010-12-20T00:33:59  <antimatroid1> i'm wondering if maybe it's something to do with the way i get information from the player
2010-12-20T00:35:07  <antimatroid1> the engine also seems to chew up about as much memory as the two running bots, so that also makes me think maybe the io has issues
2010-12-20T00:36:11  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i think jeff is going to start working on an engine too
2010-12-20T00:36:20  <antimatroid1> so hopefully that can just replace my pile of..
2010-12-20T00:36:41  <antimatroid1> i gave him the format your visualiser is currently passing and told him to talk to you if he wants to deviate from that
2010-12-20T00:37:06  <Frontier> I don't think he will snip with the fingers and be done either ;). But it sounds like this is coming closer to being official then.
2010-12-20T00:39:22  <antimatroid1> not so sure
2010-12-20T00:39:31  <antimatroid1> i think we should still see what people think
2010-12-20T00:39:41  <antimatroid1> delt0r seems to be less excited by the idea every day
2010-12-20T00:40:04  <antimatroid1> and the new game he's working on sounds quite cool
2010-12-20T00:40:14  <antimatroid1> but yeah, i want ants :D

2010-12-20T03:12:25  <antimatroid> like/dislike?
2010-12-20T03:12:33  <antimatroid> you don't actually see the whole map when you start
2010-12-20T03:16:00  <mega1> is the goal to have more ants then the opponent?
2010-12-20T03:16:02  <mega1> *than
2010-12-20T03:16:18  <antimatroid> if you get an ant on their base, you win, otherwise yes, max ants at the end of the game
2010-12-20T03:16:39  <antimatroid> if ants land on the same square, friend ants fuse and then the two enemies fight to the death, essentially (i do that in one step)
2010-12-20T03:16:57  <antimatroid> and an ant spawns on the home base after deposits if grains are there
2010-12-20T03:17:23  <antimatroid> you can also "attack" an enemy ant adjacent to you, which is inflicted before walk moves are made
2010-12-20T03:17:28  <mega1> how can two friendly ants land on the same square?
2010-12-20T03:17:37  <mega1> they seemed to avoid each other
2010-12-20T03:18:04  <antimatroid> the bot is currently written to not move them onto each other
2010-12-20T03:18:17  <antimatroid> but it can happen, and you map not be able to move an ant on home base before the next spawns
2010-12-20T03:18:46  <antimatroid> i don't expect people to want to fuse their own ants, it was just a way of letting people sort of walk anywhere that isn't a wall
2010-12-20T03:18:48  <mega1> what's the 5/0?
2010-12-20T03:18:55  <antimatroid> hp/harvest
2010-12-20T03:19:04  <mega1> limits?
2010-12-20T03:19:07  <antimatroid> there is no limit to hp level or harvest
2010-12-20T03:19:14  <antimatroid> max starting grains on a square is 9
2010-12-20T03:19:18  <antimatroid> due to char map
2010-12-20T03:19:44  <antimatroid> you can deposit harvest to adjacent ants too, so set up supply chains
2010-12-20T03:19:45  <mega1> so the goal is to solve the foraging problem better than real ants
2010-12-20T03:19:53  <antimatroid> yes, and invade their base
2010-12-20T03:20:11  <antimatroid> you don't know where their base is at the start though
2010-12-20T03:20:15  <mega1> the algorithm used by real ants is mostly known
2010-12-20T03:20:17  <antimatroid> because you only have a certain view radius
2010-12-20T03:20:41  <mega1> (only the foraging part)
2010-12-20T03:20:52  <antimatroid> yeah, foraging is the easy part though
2010-12-20T03:21:06  <antimatroid> hard is defending base/invading theirs and fights
2010-12-20T03:21:23  <mega1> the linked game looked like a traffic jam simulator
2010-12-20T03:21:46  <antimatroid> yeah, maps could be bigger and grains diminished
2010-12-20T03:21:56  <antimatroid> and that bot strategy is rather stupid
2010-12-20T03:22:23  <mega1> so what determines the number of ants?
2010-12-20T03:22:34  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2010-12-20T03:22:44  <antimatroid> there can only be one ant in a square at the start of a turn
2010-12-20T03:23:03  <antimatroid> it doesn't matter what the hp of each ant is
2010-12-20T03:23:15  <mega1> when are new ants spawned?

2010-12-20T03:23:17  *** narnach1 is now known as narnach_mb
2010-12-20T03:23:27  <mega1> grain is necessary
2010-12-20T03:23:35  <mega1> is there another condition?
2010-12-20T03:23:44  <antimatroid> after deposits/attacks/harvests and if a grain is on home base
2010-12-20T03:23:55  <antimatroid> and it diminishes the number of grains there by 1
2010-12-20T03:24:04  <antimatroid> that could require 5 grains for a new ant too
2010-12-20T03:24:07  <antimatroid> or any other number
2010-12-20T03:24:19  <mega1> if there is grain a new ant is always spawned?
2010-12-20T03:24:26  <antimatroid> yes
2010-12-20T03:24:31  <antimatroid> it will fuse if it has to
2010-12-20T03:24:38  <mega1> no upkeep for ants?
2010-12-20T03:24:47  <antimatroid> but if an ant is there but moves that turn, it doesn't fuse
2010-12-20T03:25:02  <antimatroid> upkeep? hp gains?
2010-12-20T03:25:10  <antimatroid> if two ants fuse, their hp combines, same as harvest
2010-12-20T03:25:18  <antimatroid> if you land on an enemy ant and it dies, you get its harvest
2010-12-20T03:25:19  <mega1> "pay 1 grain per 10 turns for each ant"
2010-12-20T03:25:38  <antimatroid> nothing like that atm
2010-12-20T03:25:52  <antimatroid> it's still being worked out
2010-12-20T03:26:02  <mega1> so I can build a superant by fusing 5
2010-12-20T03:26:09  <mega1> and it will have 25hp
2010-12-20T03:26:10  <antimatroid> yes, but i think it's a bad move
2010-12-20T03:26:22  <mega1> depends on battle resolution
2010-12-20T03:26:32  <mega1> 25hp vs 5hp => ???
2010-12-20T03:26:34  <antimatroid> similarly, if two enemy ants are adjacent, your best move is to attack the enemy, not try to move onto them etc.
2010-12-20T03:26:43  <antimatroid> but that changes when multiple ants are adjacent
2010-12-20T03:26:57  <antimatroid> new ant with 20hp
2010-12-20T03:27:17  <antimatroid> you may want to do it when charging their base
2010-12-20T03:27:17  <mega1> what does an ant see?
2010-12-20T03:27:28  <antimatroid> anything it can reach within 6 moves
2010-12-20T03:27:39  <antimatroid> including through walls (i think that makes it more interesting, but easy to change)
2010-12-20T03:27:49  <antimatroid> your base can see the same distance every turn too
2010-12-20T03:28:52  <antimatroid> since edges are wraped (yay torus game) i also translate the maps by a random amount after generating, so you have no idea where their home base could be, otherwise it had to be one of a certain set from possible symmetries
2010-12-20T03:29:01  <mega1> torus is good
2010-12-20T03:29:39  <antimatroid> oh, and the map gen ensures you can reach every non-wall square from your base
2010-12-20T03:29:43  <mega1> how does fog of war work?
2010-12-20T03:29:57  <antimatroid> you only get new information for a currently seeable square each turn
2010-12-20T03:30:02  <antimatroid> you are welcome to store old information
2010-12-20T03:30:30  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/HKqtiP0h
2010-12-20T03:30:44  <antimatroid> that's a more detailed version of input/output move ordering etc.

2010-12-20T03:31:41  <mega1> and on the technical side, how is it ensured that ants only have information about what they see and there is no sharing of information?
2010-12-20T03:31:51  <antimatroid> all ants are the one process
2010-12-20T03:31:57  <antimatroid> they all know what each other know
2010-12-20T03:32:03  <mega1> ah
2010-12-20T03:32:06  <antimatroid> you can't have home bases, one process and prevent that
2010-12-20T03:32:19  <mega1> yes
2010-12-20T03:32:35  <mega1> I thought from the ant theme that it's a swarm game
2010-12-20T03:32:46  <antimatroid> delt0r has a different spec where each ant gets fed relative information in the one process
2010-12-20T03:32:59  <antimatroid> but really one will just spend the start coordination who is who
2010-12-20T03:33:01  <antimatroid> and where
2010-12-20T03:33:09  <antimatroid> it was, but it's hard to do
2010-12-20T03:33:18  <mega1> yes
2010-12-20T03:33:19  <antimatroid> this is just the game i came up with from the discussion
2010-12-20T03:34:13  <antimatroid> i don't think it's as hard as planet wars though
2010-12-20T03:34:18  <antimatroid> the more that i think about it
2010-12-20T03:34:37  <mega1> it's hard to tell beforehand
2010-12-20T03:34:48  <antimatroid> true, i thought planet wars would be easier
2010-12-20T03:35:02  <antimatroid> but painting a discrete grid for movement is pretty trivial
2010-12-20T03:35:35  <antimatroid> coordinating them to not screw each other up might be a bit tricky
2010-12-20T03:37:27  <mega1> I think planet wars with a battle resolution that's less linear would be a different game.
2010-12-20T03:38:30  <mega1> not that I'm proposing another variant of pw.
2010-12-20T03:38:51  <antimatroid> yes, proportional growth would throw things completely
2010-12-20T03:40:22  <mega1> I remember playing simant, it was pretty boring, but it has not combat as far as I can recall.
2010-12-20T03:40:53  <antimatroid> not combat?
2010-12-20T03:41:07  <antimatroid> my favourite thing about these games is the simultaneous game aspect
2010-12-20T03:41:25  <antimatroid> they also result in faster paced games
2010-12-20T03:41:40  <antimatroid> well, often

2010-12-20T04:39:04  <antimatroid1> how old are you?
2010-12-20T04:39:07  <Epona> 19
2010-12-20T04:39:17  <antimatroid1> ah, you probably didn't get into it until the cards came out?
2010-12-20T04:39:24  <Epona> yellow version
2010-12-20T04:39:32  <antimatroid1> meh, i've never even played that :P
2010-12-20T04:39:33  <Epona> I had that
2010-12-20T04:39:39  <Epona> its the same as red and blue
2010-12-20T04:39:44  <Epona> with a pikachu following you
2010-12-20T04:39:48  <Epona> lil more color
2010-12-20T04:40:08  <Epona> my first game though was zelda
2010-12-20T04:40:17  <Epona> talk about mind blowing
2010-12-20T04:41:34  <antimatroid1> my brother goe a nes when i was young
2010-12-20T04:41:38  <antimatroid1> mario and duck shoot ftw
2010-12-20T04:41:42  <antimatroid1> then came the snes
2010-12-20T04:42:55  <Epona> im glad to have grown up with videogames
2010-12-20T04:43:03  <Epona> im pretty sure people who didn't
2010-12-20T04:43:06  <Epona> are lacking something
2010-12-20T04:44:09  <Epona> maybe. idk
2010-12-20T04:44:12  <Epona> just a theory
2010-12-20T04:46:22  <antimatroid1> haha, i don't know about that
2010-12-20T04:46:30  <antimatroid1> i'd probably argue more the reverse
2010-12-20T04:46:37  <sigh> someone took antimatroid? o_O
2010-12-20T04:46:40  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~Naktibald@host-81-20-37-12.eckoh.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-20T04:46:43  <Epona> maybe
2010-12-20T04:46:52  <antimatroid1> i don't really play video games anymore excepting flash games cause they are awesome for procrastination
2010-12-20T04:46:56  <antimatroid1> sigh: they're evil
2010-12-20T04:47:05  <sigh> I'm suprised I got sigh on github :P
2010-12-20T04:47:14  <sigh> that was during the planets wars comp
2010-12-20T04:47:26  <antimatroid1> yeah, that's decent
2010-12-20T04:47:29  <Epona> antimatroid1, how did you get over them?
2010-12-20T04:47:53  <antimatroid1> Epona: lost interest
2010-12-20T04:48:06  <antimatroid1> didn't really pay attention in school til uni either
2010-12-20T04:48:14  <sigh> I can get over games easy because I suck at them :D
2010-12-20T04:48:30  <antimatroid1> sigh: that probably helps me too :P
2010-12-20T04:48:31  <Epona> never went to uni. don't plan on it tbh
2010-12-20T04:48:46  <antimatroid1> i prefer the ai games because it's more about the strategy i come up with rather than how i can play it there and then
2010-12-20T04:49:02  <antimatroid1> uni is a lot of fun if you take fun/challenging courses
2010-12-20T04:49:16  <Epona> I wish I just knew more about linux so I could participate
2010-12-20T04:49:20  <Epona> and python
2010-12-20T04:49:29  <Epona> gets so frustrating
2010-12-20T04:49:35  <sigh> for this comp?
2010-12-20T04:49:39  <antimatroid1> i don't know anything about linux, and the only two things i've ever written in python are the two map generators
2010-12-20T04:49:42  <sigh> you don't need to know much linux
2010-12-20T04:49:59  <antimatroid1> it's a pretty easy language
2010-12-20T04:50:33  <Epona> ah
2010-12-20T04:50:34  <antimatroid1> i can't decide on a pokemon username
2010-12-20T04:50:39  <Epona> well
2010-12-20T04:50:40  <antimatroid1> i can't believe kirby was taken :C
2010-12-20T04:50:47  <Epona> whats your personality like
2010-12-20T04:50:49  <sigh> kirby is not a pokemon O_O
2010-12-20T04:50:51  <antimatroid1> i bet i'll decide on one and it'll be taken
2010-12-20T04:50:57  <Epona> you seem like an Abra
2010-12-20T04:50:58  <antimatroid1> no, but that was my first choice
2010-12-20T04:51:06  <antimatroid1> abra sucked
2010-12-20T04:51:27  <Epona> abra could eventually get psybeam
2010-12-20T04:51:34  <Epona> one of the best moves ever
2010-12-20T04:52:17  <antimatroid1> psyduck it is
2010-12-20T04:52:24  <sigh> that's not taken?
2010-12-20T04:52:51  <antimatroid1> its not, but my email is, i may have already taken antimatroid ehe
2010-12-20T04:53:07  <sigh> hahaha
2010-12-20T04:53:57  <sigh> haha, you've uploaded your tronbot
2010-12-20T04:53:58  <Epona> >so lucky to get epona
2010-12-20T04:54:03  <sigh> yeah, that's you
2010-12-20T04:55:19  <antimatroid1> i uploaded tron bot? hmm, maybe jet created the account
2010-12-20T04:55:52  <antimatroid1> well i've claimed it back now
2010-12-20T04:55:56  <antimatroid1> i kind of want psyduck now
2010-12-20T04:56:01  <sigh> heh
2010-12-20T04:56:04  <antimatroid1> it lets me do one change, but then that's it
2010-12-20T04:56:17  <sigh> one change?
2010-12-20T04:56:35  <antimatroid1> Change your usernamePlease note that you are only given ONE rename. I understand, I want to change my username
2010-12-20T04:58:01  <sigh> oh, that's a bit odd
2010-12-20T04:58:19  <antimatroid1> yeah, i definitely didn't add that tron file
2010-12-20T04:58:28  <antimatroid1> so.. how do i add something to github? :P
2010-12-20T04:58:44  <sigh> Dunno, never done it
2010-12-20T04:58:59  <sigh> hmmm... I might as well upload my pw bot
2010-12-20T04:59:45  <antimatroid1> hmmm it have details i'll try to follow them
2010-12-20T05:02:59  <antimatroid1> bah, so much effort
2010-12-20T05:03:00  <antimatroid1> cbf
2010-12-20T05:03:02  <sigh> haha
2010-12-20T05:04:27  <antimatroid1> there should be a site like that where i can just give it a bunch of files to uploade and what language to do highlighting for
2010-12-20T05:04:34  <antimatroid1> like pastebin, but for multiple files
2010-12-20T05:05:01  <sigh> comeone... it's not that hard... I've already uploaded my entire planet wars bot just now
2010-12-20T05:05:07  <sigh> *come on
2010-12-20T05:05:57  <sigh> have you got git installed on your comp yet?
2010-12-20T05:06:22  <antimatroid1> its instlaling atm
2010-12-20T05:06:29  <antimatroid1> done
2010-12-20T05:07:43  <antimatroid1> what are you meant to type to add the public key?
2010-12-20T05:08:01  <sigh> have you got a public key/private key pair?
2010-12-20T05:08:44  <antimatroid1> i dunno?
2010-12-20T05:09:02  <antimatroid1> it says "Add your public key" with a link that has some key there
2010-12-20T05:09:08  <antimatroid1> but no mention as to what commands before it etc.
2010-12-20T05:09:52  <sigh> what is saying that?
2010-12-20T05:10:40  <antimatroid1> some page giving me instructions to make a repository
2010-12-20T05:10:43  <antimatroid1> the global setup part
2010-12-20T05:11:04  <antimatroid1> https://github.com/antimatroid/Antwars not sure that'll load the same
2010-12-20T05:11:56  <sigh> I see an empty repo
2010-12-20T05:12:06  <sigh> you need to push your code to it
2010-12-20T05:13:05  <sigh> go to your ant wars directory and do a `git init`
2010-12-20T05:15:06  <sigh> then `git add *`, then `git commit`
2010-12-20T05:15:23  <sigh> then you have a local git repo which you can push up to github

2010-12-20T05:19:01  <antimatroid1> how do you then push it?
2010-12-20T05:19:10  <sigh> yeah, or you can just `git add` files selectively
2010-12-20T05:19:18  <sigh> using the command that was on the help page
2010-12-20T05:19:32  <sigh> http://help.github.com/creating-a-repo/

2010-12-20T05:19:54  <sigh> objects?
2010-12-20T05:20:24  <antimatroid1> what are origin and master?
2010-12-20T05:20:29  <antimatroid1> do i pass those words?
2010-12-20T05:20:37  <sigh> yeah
2010-12-20T05:20:44  <sigh> master is the master branch of your repo
2010-12-20T05:21:12  <sigh> and origin is refers to the branch that your code originated from
2010-12-20T05:21:57  <sigh> you only need to change the git@github.com/... thing to your own repo
2010-12-20T05:22:06  <antimatroid1> okay, i'll do a quick clean then post what is at the moment

2010-12-20T05:28:01  <sigh> personally, I think university courses should require students to submit a repo for any programming assignment, and not just the final source
2010-12-20T05:28:27  <antimatroid1> sigh: utas sucks, we've been over this :P
2010-12-20T05:28:40  <delt0r___> sigh: I start them in a repo with hello world
2010-12-20T05:28:51  <sigh> antimatroid1: it's not just your uni
2010-12-20T05:28:51  <delt0r___> Great
2010-12-20T05:28:54  <sigh> delt0r___: good :)
2010-12-20T05:28:55  <delt0r___> is super fun
2010-12-20T05:29:19  <delt0r___> the spec will not be so simple... full integer based everything
2010-12-20T05:29:52  <delt0r___> so angles are defined as a "complex number" --like a quntinrons... whatever
2010-12-20T05:30:16  <delt0r___> but you don't need any trig functions which have some problems with 2ulp in some langs

2010-12-20T06:15:40  <Error323> very easily

2010-12-20T06:26:41  <antimatroid1> yes, take a look at that game too
2010-12-20T06:26:50  <delt0r_> http://www.mabs.at/ewing/HackAnt.jar
2010-12-20T06:26:54  <delt0r_> src included
2010-12-20T06:27:11  <antimatroid1> delr0r_: what about your new one? i'm quite interested in that
2010-12-20T06:27:24  <delt0r_> the post is here:http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1205&start=60#p8279
2010-12-20T06:27:42  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: I am adding polish i like it so much
2010-12-20T06:27:57  <delt0r_> want to have it have more attention than my ant hack
2010-12-20T06:28:14  <delt0r_> so am fishing a nice visulizer and a TCP setup
2010-12-20T06:28:22  <delt0r_> + human mode
2010-12-20T06:28:33  <delt0r_> may get a server too
2010-12-20T06:28:56  <antimatroid1> :)
2010-12-20T06:28:58  <delt0r_> so it will be a few days... i have xmass shopping today.
2010-12-20T06:29:11  <antimatroid1> yes, i haven't done that yet either
2010-12-20T06:29:23  <delt0r_> buts its cool
2010-12-20T06:29:34  <delt0r_> fighters, corvets, destroyers
2010-12-20T06:29:40  <delt0r_> warp guns
2010-12-20T06:29:44  <delt0r_> lasers
2010-12-20T06:29:51  <delt0r_> and a mother ship
2010-12-20T06:29:51  <antimatroid1> everybody loves lazers
2010-12-20T06:30:02  <delt0r_> and nebular
2010-12-20T06:30:14  <delt0r_> nebulars are cool
2010-12-20T06:31:05  <delt0r_> if the mother ship dies --you lose
2010-12-20T06:31:35  <antimatroid1> it sounds like a more awesome version of ants
2010-12-20T06:31:35  <delt0r_> fighters are fast but only shoot forward and have little armor
2010-12-20T06:32:14  <delt0r_> corvets are slower but can shoot in any direction regadless of which what they fly but have less range
2010-12-20T06:33:12  <antimatroid1> i want to do both :(
2010-12-20T06:33:15  <delt0r_> arty have warp guns. Range is not affected by nebular. but they can't shoot unless still, have area damage and large range
2010-12-20T06:33:36  <aerique> delt0r_: sounds awesome
2010-12-20T06:34:02  <delt0r_> destroys are hulking big ships with a ton of armor and guns, moves like a lead brick
2010-12-20T06:34:27  <delt0r_> mother ships don;t shoot and just sit there till they die
2010-12-20T06:34:44  <delt0r_> aerique: well ballance is an issue
2010-12-20T06:35:00  <delt0r_> and too complicated for a stater pack is one as well
2010-12-20T06:35:11  <delt0r_> perhaps just 2 or 3 types of unit
2010-12-20T06:35:30  <delt0r_> you don't get extra units during the game... what you start with is all you have
2010-12-20T06:35:44  <antimatroid1> hmmm, spawning new ships is cool i think
2010-12-20T06:36:07  <delt0r_> The idea is that you have what you have, (like chess), now kill the enemy
2010-12-20T06:36:16  <delt0r_> makes for shorter games
2010-12-20T06:36:32  <delt0r_> so i was thinking around 16 units per team or less
2010-12-20T06:36:52  <sigh> what? I can't spawn units in chess?
2010-12-20T06:36:53  <delt0r_> but lots of units would be fun, just hard to manage for a bot
2010-12-20T06:36:57  <antimatroid1> why short games?
2010-12-20T06:37:00  <sigh> I think I've been playing wrong ._.
2010-12-20T06:37:02  <antimatroid1> sigh: don't be annoying :P
2010-12-20T06:37:05  <sigh> :(
2010-12-20T06:37:17  <delt0r_> long games makes for bad leader boards
2010-12-20T06:37:20  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-20T06:37:33  <delt0r_> there is a very real cost in $$ and cpu for long expensive games
2010-12-20T06:37:36  <antimatroid1> i don't want games to be too short
2010-12-20T06:38:00  <delt0r_> planet wars was about right.. longer just won't work imo
2010-12-20T06:38:26  <Epona> length is relative
2010-12-20T06:38:33  <antimatroid1> just need moar servers
2010-12-20T06:38:46  <Epona> Ive got a pretty good comp
2010-12-20T06:38:52  <Epona> any way I could help?
2010-12-20T06:39:09  <delt0r_> yes.. but you don't have 4000 entries on your machines....
2010-12-20T06:39:29  <antimatroid1> ideally all servers should be the same hardware and software setup
2010-12-20T06:39:39  <Epona> ah
2010-12-20T06:39:40  <sigh> they will most likey be ec2 instances
2010-12-20T06:39:53  <delt0r_> thats 16M games for each person to play each other person just once
2010-12-20T06:39:59  <sigh> so making it uniform, and spooling up more will be easy
2010-12-20T06:40:04  <delt0r_> sigh: again, not free
2010-12-20T06:40:07  <sigh> it is purely a cost issue, really
2010-12-20T06:40:11  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't be surprised if google could be talked into throwing in more server cash next time, maybe even more
2010-12-20T06:40:31  <delt0r_> add cost because "long games are better" is not a good idea
2010-12-20T06:40:38  <Epona> how do you convince google to throw you cash?
2010-12-20T06:40:45  <antimatroid1> by making them look good
2010-12-20T06:40:49  <Epona> ah
2010-12-20T06:41:01  <antimatroid1> same as any advertisement deal
2010-12-20T06:41:04  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: takes a lot more work than it looks like to set up sponsership
2010-12-20T06:41:26  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: i know
2010-12-20T06:41:26  <delt0r_> its pretty much too late for feb IMO
2010-12-20T06:41:46  <antimatroid1> jeff said he got some money off them for planet wars
2010-12-20T06:41:59  <antimatroid1> i wouldn't be surprised if that was arranged at least this late
2010-12-20T06:41:59  <sigh> oh?
2010-12-20T06:42:21  <delt0r_> so games with play times in the 5 min bracket or less is preferable
2010-12-20T06:42:24  <antimatroid1> to pay for servers, not for him individually
2010-12-20T06:42:42  <antimatroid1> yes, i would like games to be less than 3 minutes or so max
2010-12-20T06:43:04  <delt0r_> amazon could use for "cost effect  "oncost"  ec2 solutions"
2010-12-20T06:43:11  <sigh> yeah... I think it makes it easier on the contestants as well
2010-12-20T06:43:18  <sigh> faster to test and so on
2010-12-20T06:43:39  <antimatroid1> it wasn't very many bots who ended up using much of their time for planet wars either
2010-12-20T06:43:43  <delt0r_> but by short games thats what i mean
2010-12-20T06:44:06  <antimatroid1> i like fast paced games, but i don't mind them going a few hundred turns
2010-12-20T06:44:35  <delt0r_> well i was thinking 200 or so turns.. or even 400-500 with shorter time limits
2010-12-20T06:45:02  <antimatroid1> i say starter it higher than necessary
2010-12-20T06:45:04  <delt0r_> ie .25 sec or so
2010-12-20T06:45:11  <antimatroid1> it's easier to shorten than lengthen the max number of turns
2010-12-20T06:45:16  <antimatroid1> start*
2010-12-20T06:47:42  <antimatroid1> rabidus: did you end up compiling that engine and running it?
2010-12-20T06:47:54  <antimatroid1> i know sigh got it going the other day, i'm hoping it keeps working for others
2010-12-20T06:48:14  <sigh> I had to change some stuff
2010-12-20T06:48:21  <antimatroid1> sigh: i fixed that up i think
2010-12-20T06:48:48  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: get a real dev platform... get unix... :)
2010-12-20T06:48:58  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: mehffort!
2010-12-20T06:49:56  <delt0r_> slackware for the win
2010-12-20T06:50:39  <antimatroid1> unless i am actually interested in what i'm doing, i'm very slack :)
2010-12-20T06:51:08  <antimatroid1> hence why i'm never doing another applied maths course in my life
2010-12-20T06:52:18  <delt0r_> real mathematicians don't use window ;)
2010-12-20T06:52:22  <antimatroid1> i like the theory side of applied stuff, even stats (never thought i'd say that), but as soon as i'm asked to just trudge through a whole bunch of computations, bleh
2010-12-20T06:52:50  <sigh> that's what computers are for?
2010-12-20T06:52:54  <antimatroid1> yes
2010-12-20T06:53:04  <antimatroid1> i'll happily go and write them a program to solve it
2010-12-20T06:53:40  <antimatroid1> i did that for an algebra problem
2010-12-20T06:53:50  <antimatroid1> i gave my lecturer a few hundred case proof :D
2010-12-20T06:54:03  <delt0r_> i noticed that even window ec2 instances were quite a bit more expensive than linux
2010-12-20T06:54:16  <antimatroid1> why would anyone use a windows server?
2010-12-20T06:54:36  <delt0r_> why would any dev on windows ?
2010-12-20T06:55:00  <antimatroid1> too lazy to every install linux long enough to get used to it
2010-12-20T06:55:25  <delt0r_> there you go
2010-12-20T06:55:27  <antimatroid1> i had a mac laptop all through middle and high school, but meh i prefer windows to mac
2010-12-20T06:55:47  <delt0r_> thats why some will want a window server... don't want the hassle of learning something new
2010-12-20T06:55:48  <antimatroid1> i swear giving every student a laptop is counterproductive for education
2010-12-20T06:56:03  <antimatroid1> they even gave us a file server with a public folder for all grade 7's
2010-12-20T06:56:04  <delt0r_> yep

2010-12-20T06:56:39  <delt0r_> computers for edu are overrated.. mainly because they are not used for it after issueing...

2010-12-20T06:56:59  <antimatroid1> yeah, i don't even have a laptop for uni, it would be more of a distraction
2010-12-20T06:57:10  <antimatroid1> all i do when i'm not in class is play flash games in the maths lab anyway

2010-12-20T07:01:00  <antimatroid1> those suckers will clear anything up
2010-12-20T07:01:18  <antimatroid1> worst is when you rub out like half a page, then on the last unecessary swipe you scrunch the page

2010-12-20T07:02:05  <rabidus> maybe in ~6 hours or something
2010-12-20T07:02:34  <sigh> I hardly ever wrote anything in class, and just copied my friends' notes if I need them :P
2010-12-20T07:03:04  <antimatroid1> sigh: my maths lecturers don't do slides, it goes on the board and you write that shit down
2010-12-20T07:03:20  <antimatroid1> i actually much prefer that to slides though
2010-12-20T07:03:35  <antimatroid1> it gives you something to do while forcing you to stay focused
2010-12-20T07:03:39  <sigh> meh, I hate just mindlessly copying stuff
2010-12-20T07:03:48  <antimatroid1> the idea is to pay attention :P
2010-12-20T07:04:08  <antimatroid1> they have to write it on the board too, it's not like copying down a slide in the time it takes them to say it

2010-12-20T07:04:46  <antimatroid1> somehow my highest maths mark probably came from the maths unit i put the least amount of effort into
2010-12-20T07:04:50  <sigh> I find I take in more if I'm not just constantly writing :P
2010-12-20T07:05:29  <antimatroid1> i usually understand a definition/theorem better once writing it out and thinking about what i write rather than looking at it up on the screen
2010-12-20T07:05:34  <antimatroid1> which is why i like the method most
2010-12-20T07:05:34  <delt0r_> I try to understand first... write 2nd
2010-12-20T07:05:41  <delt0r_> worked out well so far
2010-12-20T07:06:14  <antimatroid1> or in the case of my algebra lecturer, after about 3 hours of banging my head on his assignment problems
2010-12-20T07:06:22  <antimatroid1> weekly assignments can be a real bitch sometimes
2010-12-20T07:08:37  <antimatroid1> it was quite funny this year, our computational techniques class was with engineers, so we were put in the arts lecture theatre, but apparently they decided they can teach without white boards in their big main lecture theatre, so we had to move
2010-12-20T07:09:50  <sigh> I don't get it
2010-12-20T07:10:27  <delt0r_> whats difference between an Observer pattern, a listener, and a callback
2010-12-20T07:10:30  <delt0r_> ?
2010-12-20T07:10:41  <antimatroid1> sigh: they took out all whiteboards in their lecture theatres
2010-12-20T07:10:45  <delt0r_> Oh.. wrong chanel
2010-12-20T07:12:16  <sigh> antimatroid1: that's a bit odd
2010-12-20T07:13:33  <delt0r_> but feel free to answer it anyway
2010-12-20T07:13:46  <sigh> ok :)
2010-12-20T07:13:57  <sigh> imo observer and listener are the same thing
2010-12-20T07:13:57  * delt0r_ talking to himself (with billy idol playing in the background)
2010-12-20T07:14:13  <delt0r_> imo they are all the same thing
2010-12-20T07:14:21  <antimatroid1> i have nfi
2010-12-20T07:14:46  <delt0r_> But i see people make a distinction
2010-12-20T07:15:08  <delt0r_> you Aussies really do have potty mouths don't you
2010-12-20T07:15:18  <sigh> callbacks seem like a more general concept
2010-12-20T07:15:29  <antimatroid1> i am terrible with swear words
2010-12-20T07:15:39  <antimatroid1> i try to be fairly reasonable with them in here
2010-12-20T07:16:13  <antimatroid1> it's hard, my favourite word is the c word, but everyone seems to hate it
2010-12-20T07:16:18  <antimatroid1> it rolls off the tongue so nicely
2010-12-20T07:16:21  <sigh> listener/observer strikes me as a more strict interface about notifiying every time on given event
2010-12-20T07:16:49  <delt0r_> sigh: where notification is provided with a callback
2010-12-20T07:17:06  <sigh> that's why I said a callback is a more general concept
2010-12-20T07:17:07  <delt0r_> while a callback can be used for other things too such as --sorting
2010-12-20T07:17:23  <delt0r_> sigh: yea--I am following your train of thought
2010-12-20T07:17:28  <delt0r_> yea ok
2010-12-20T07:17:31  <delt0r_> that works for me
2010-12-20T07:17:34  <sigh> :)
2010-12-20T07:18:02  <delt0r_> Observers and listeners are the same thing... while callbacks are more general
2010-12-20T07:18:14  <sigh> that is my opinion
2010-12-20T07:18:21  <delt0r_> is observers are callbacks but not all callbacks are observers
2010-12-20T07:18:57  <antimatroid1> bah, just say subset :P
2010-12-20T07:18:57  <sigh> I think it is better to say all observers use callbacks
2010-12-20T07:19:06  <sigh> or are implemented using callbacks

2010-12-20T07:34:52  <Epona> lol
2010-12-20T07:35:02  <MatthiasM> Epona: looks like python
2010-12-20T07:35:02  *** dmj111 <dmj111!~user@c-98-235-91-228.hsd1.pa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-20T07:35:13  <Epona> I can't seem to find a good way to piece it together in my head
2010-12-20T07:35:17  <Epona> like how to fully use it
2010-12-20T07:35:22  <Epona> the self part
2010-12-20T07:35:24  <Epona> at least
2010-12-20T07:35:26  <MatthiasM> that's the syntax for class methods
2010-12-20T07:35:46  <MatthiasM> eg Java passes the 'this' pointer implicit - while in Python it's explicit
2010-12-20T07:36:15  <sigh> Epona: when you call a method on a class, it always passes the object that as the first arguement to the method
2010-12-20T07:36:15  <Epona> guess I have to keep reading
2010-12-20T07:36:55  <antimatroid1> i didn't know that
2010-12-20T07:36:55  <Epona> so, the stuff in the parenthesis are potential objects?
2010-12-20T07:37:09  <MatthiasM> no - the parameters to that method
2010-12-20T07:37:17  <antimatroid1> Epona: when you construct the object, it's taking in a pointer of the location to create it
2010-12-20T07:37:35  <antimatroid1> in java/c++ it does it for you, in python it doesn't
2010-12-20T07:37:45  <Epona> wonderful
2010-12-20T07:37:50  <sigh> antimatroid1: you are going to confuse her :P

2010-12-20T07:38:01  <antimatroid1> Epona: are you a girl?
2010-12-20T07:38:12  <delt0r_> well its implicit rather than explicit... not the same as does it for you or not
2010-12-20T07:38:17  <Epona> trans-girl
2010-12-20T07:38:23  <MatthiasM> Epona: are you new to OO or also to Python?
2010-12-20T07:38:28  <antimatroid1> not to jump, i've just been waiting to come across the first girl contestant
2010-12-20T07:38:31  <antimatroid1> close enough for me
2010-12-20T07:38:36  <delt0r_> Epona: pointer == reference
2010-12-20T07:38:38  <Epona> both. more new to objects though
2010-12-20T07:38:58  <sigh> antimatroid1: I'm pretty sure burny was a girl
2010-12-20T07:39:04  <delt0r_> pointer is the evil C/C++ version of a reference
2010-12-20T07:39:16  <MatthiasM> Epona: ok - let's say you have a Dog object - you want to call bark() on it
2010-12-20T07:39:30  <antimatroid1> sigh: shows how observant i am :P
2010-12-20T07:39:32  <Epona> bark() being the first method
2010-12-20T07:39:34  <Epona> right
2010-12-20T07:39:55  <antimatroid1> Epona: pointer == variable giving memory location of what it's point to
2010-12-20T07:39:59  <MatthiasM> Epona: you need to pass the object which should bark to the method - this is done as first parameter which is called 'self' by convention
2010-12-20T07:40:29  <Epona> what do you mean by pass the object?
2010-12-20T07:40:35  <MatthiasM> Epona: so using 'self' you can access properties of your object for which the method is executed
2010-12-20T07:40:47  <antimatroid1> i think it's time for binky
2010-12-20T07:41:07  <antimatroid1> Epona: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-pJlnpkLp0
2010-12-20T07:41:19  <Epona> kk watchin
2010-12-20T07:42:19  <sigh> why are you all going on about pointers? That is the most round-about way of explaining objects in Python ><
2010-12-20T07:42:34  <antimatroid1> i'm explaining the this
2010-12-20T07:42:36  <MatthiasM> lol
2010-12-20T07:42:52  <delt0r_> sigh: agree
2010-12-20T07:42:53  <antimatroid1> you're not really passing the object yeah? just a reference?
2010-12-20T07:43:02  <antimatroid1> i shouldn't try to teach programming :P
2010-12-20T07:43:10  <delt0r_> references don't quite behave like pointer --
2010-12-20T07:43:15  <delt0r_> in C/C++
2010-12-20T07:43:21  <antimatroid1> but binky is a must see for anyone
2010-12-20T07:43:50  <Epona> omg binky died
2010-12-20T07:44:02  <sigh> not when you are already getting your head around python and oo, and then trying to understand pointers on top of that
2010-12-20T07:44:42  <delt0r_> sigh: understand a reference is important
2010-12-20T07:45:44  <MatthiasM> Epona: try this http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/OOP.shtml
2010-12-20T07:46:22  <Epona> kk
2010-12-20T07:46:36  <sigh> delt0r_: never said it wasn't
2010-12-20T07:47:02  <delt0r_> well i can't see how you can do classes, OO without understand references...
2010-12-20T07:47:25  <delt0r_> as this converstion about def bark(self) shows
2010-12-20T07:47:28  <delt0r_> i think

2010-12-20T07:48:27  <MatthiasM> Epona: when you pass a reference the object itself doesn't move or change - you just tell someone else about it
2010-12-20T07:49:07  <Epona> oh hmm
2010-12-20T07:50:05  <sigh> delt0r_: you may be right... honestly I learnt C before learning any OO language so I can't really give an opinion about how to learn OO without understanding pointers already

2010-12-20T07:56:55  <sigh> delt0r_: actually... thinking about it more, I don't understand why you think understanding references are more important in understanding classes than anywhere
2010-12-20T07:57:51  <sigh> if bar is of type Bar then "bar.foo()" is the same as calling "Bar.foo(bar)"
2010-12-20T07:58:38  <sigh> you can think of Bar.foo as just a normal function with a namespace, rather than a method... so if you understand function calls, you can understand method calls
2010-12-20T08:02:39  <delt0r_> sigh: Every time we have avoided references when teaching --it has gone badly
2010-12-20T08:03:13  <sigh> I'll take your word for it :)
2010-12-20T08:03:58  <delt0r_> so we do references while ignoring "classes" first... then move on to classes (as a stuct really) then move on to inheritance etc
2010-12-20T08:04:33  * antimatroid1 has a very poor understanding of programming in general
2010-12-20T08:04:39  <delt0r_> personally a little C doesn't hurt...
2010-12-20T08:04:52  <antimatroid1> our second year algo's class was taught in c
2010-12-20T08:05:17  <delt0r_> C++ is a bit much syntax and file and build management thou
2010-12-20T08:05:37  <delt0r_> for first years anyway
2010-12-20T08:05:39  <antimatroid1> one can use c++ without knowing very much
2010-12-20T08:05:39  <sigh> that's reasonable... I don't feel that making students learn about references and classes at the same time is good
2010-12-20T08:05:52  <antimatroid1> sigh: i agree with that
2010-12-20T08:06:00  <delt0r_> would tend to you GC langs for the bulk however, ie python/java
2010-12-20T08:06:21  <antimatroid1> i don't see why python isn't more common than java as a first language
2010-12-20T08:06:29  <antimatroid1> bloody business world
2010-12-20T08:06:52  <delt0r_> in the real world dev time matters more than anything other single thing
2010-12-20T08:06:55  <antimatroid1> i've never looked at C#
2010-12-20T08:07:21  <delt0r_> python is good there... java is better than C++ cus of GC
2010-12-20T08:07:47  <antimatroid1> yeah, i am getting sick of some things with c++, i really need to spend more time with haskell
2010-12-20T08:08:09  <delt0r_> haskell is fun... but its not going to get you a job for a very long time
2010-12-20T08:08:10  <antimatroid1> templates are a pita with c++
2010-12-20T08:08:27  <antimatroid1> i'm not looking for a programming job
2010-12-20T08:08:31  <delt0r_> ocaml or scalar may
2010-12-20T08:08:42  <antimatroid1> well, maybe algo trading at some point, but that'd be c++
2010-12-20T08:09:24  <antimatroid1> i don't think i'd be much of a programmer in the real world though
2010-12-20T08:09:38  <antimatroid1> as is apparent by my lack of knowledge with git, debuggers etc.
2010-12-20T08:09:52  <sigh> those things are not hard to pick up
2010-12-20T08:10:14  <sigh> I only started working with git this year
2010-12-20T08:10:26  <antimatroid1> i really need to make the jump away from windows
2010-12-20T08:10:28  <antimatroid1> but meh
2010-12-20T08:10:49  <antimatroid1> do you all use debian? or..?
2010-12-20T08:11:02  <antimatroid1> sigh is mac
2010-12-20T08:11:13  <Epona> Im about to use debian on a spare computer
2010-12-20T08:11:21  <sigh> my desktop is ubuntu
2010-12-20T08:11:29  <Epona> apparently its a powerpc
2010-12-20T08:11:36  <Epona> so I have limited choices
2010-12-20T08:12:01  <antimatroid1> i can probably source a hard drive from somewhere at some point
2010-12-20T08:12:15  <antimatroid1> i'll install it on that and start playing around some time

2010-12-20T19:07:52  <jmcarthur> wow this ant thing has progressed very far already
2010-12-20T19:11:18  <jmcarthur> is there a spec draft for it anywhere yet?
2010-12-20T19:12:27  <McLeopold> Is it going to be the feb contest?
2010-12-20T19:13:13  <jmcarthur> i haven't even been watching this channel enough to know how seriously it was being developed already
2010-12-20T19:13:44  <Zannick> there's no official decision yet
2010-12-20T19:14:00  <McLeopold> are there official options?
2010-12-20T19:14:16  <Zannick> no one's really said very much officially
2010-12-20T19:14:30  <jmcarthur> *sigh* of course not
2010-12-20T19:15:23  <Zannick> i outlined some things i would look for in a game and asked for suggestions in the behind the scenes forum but no responses yet
2010-12-20T19:17:50  <jmcarthur> i generally agree with what you wrote there i think

2010-12-20T19:19:16  <jmcarthur> somebody commented on the game ideas wiki page that redoing tron would be nice, but i'm not so sure we could get away with actually calling it tron now that there is a lot of attention on that name

2010-12-20T19:19:39  <jmcarthur> still, a new twist on tron could be cool if we give it a new name
2010-12-20T19:20:09  <jmcarthur> there were a lot of variants that participants came up with during the tron contest, i think
2010-12-20T19:20:40  <Zannick> i think one of the big successes from planet wars is the large game space
2010-12-20T19:20:40  <jmcarthur> e.g. each bot controls three bikes like in the real tron
2010-12-20T19:20:52  <Zannick> tron had three moves per bot per turn
2010-12-20T19:21:11  <jmcarthur> i agree
2010-12-20T19:21:20  <jmcarthur> arbitrary angles could make it much more interesting though :)
2010-12-20T19:21:29  <Zannick> haha
2010-12-20T19:21:30  <jmcarthur> not very tron-like
2010-12-20T19:21:35  <jmcarthur> but it would be neat
2010-12-20T19:21:51  <Zannick> analog tron
2010-12-20T19:22:06  <jmcarthur> semi-analog
2010-12-20T19:22:11  <McLeopold> hexalog?
2010-12-20T19:22:18  <jmcarthur> i would assume that for simplicity we would not have rotational intertia
2010-12-20T19:22:25  <jmcarthur> or any inertia

2010-12-20T19:22:37  <jmcarthur> hexalog doesn't add enough variables i think
2010-12-20T19:22:41  <jmcarthur> unless it's also 3v3
2010-12-20T19:22:44  <jmcarthur> then it might :)
2010-12-20T19:22:49  <Zannick> 3d hexalog 3v3
2010-12-20T19:23:01  <jmcarthur> it's not hexalog if it's 3d :P
2010-12-20T19:23:08  <Zannick> hahaha :P
2010-12-20T19:24:04  <jmcarthur> 3d tron would be weird, too
2010-12-20T19:24:17  <jmcarthur> what do the tails look like? how would they box in your opponent?
2010-12-20T19:24:32  <jmcarthur> they'd have to practically be infinite planes
2010-12-20T19:24:41  <Zannick> it would be pretty tricky to box in an opponent, i think
2010-12-20T19:24:58  <Zannick> i'm imagining just a grid, like the tron contest
2010-12-20T19:25:17  <Zannick> where every square (cube) gets blocked off when a player exits it
2010-12-20T19:26:05  <jmcarthur> ah, cubes
2010-12-20T19:26:23  <Zannick> what else tesselates 3-space?
2010-12-20T19:26:30  <Zannick> i can't picture anything
2010-12-20T19:27:21  <jmcarthur> i think there are a few other known ways, but 3d cubes could be complex enough
2010-12-20T19:27:29  <Zannick> yeah
2010-12-20T19:27:30  <jmcarthur> i still think it would be too tough to box somebody in though
2010-12-20T19:27:40  <jmcarthur> and visualizing could suck a lot
2010-12-20T19:28:13  <Zannick> i think we already knew we weren't going to do 3d :P
2010-12-20T19:31:20  <McLeopold> How about chinese checkers?
2010-12-20T19:31:41  <McLeopold> minimax, but the board evaluation might be fun
2010-12-20T19:32:00  <McLeopold> plus, you could do up to 6 players
2010-12-20T19:32:26  <Zannick> that would be pretty neat
2010-12-20T19:32:56  <Zannick> having 6 players actually lessens the ability of minimax/alphabeta
2010-12-20T19:32:58  <McLeopold> I'm remembering the games I learned from my klutz press book...
2010-12-20T19:33:35  <Zannick> i've thought about making a bot for audiosurf so i thought about suggesting it
2010-12-20T19:33:50  <Zannick> the problem is it's an independent competition, rather than a battle
2010-12-20T19:34:00  <McLeopold> is mancala solved?
2010-12-20T19:39:01  <jmcarthur> i really want a game where players have hidden information
2010-12-20T19:39:27  <jmcarthur> of some sort, at least
2010-12-20T19:39:28  <Zannick> how about a version of BS?
2010-12-20T19:39:33  <Zannick> with multiple players
2010-12-20T19:39:37  <Zannick> :D
2010-12-20T19:39:39  <jmcarthur> stratego, perhaps?
2010-12-20T19:40:23  <jmcarthur> it's turn based, but minimax would be too tough due to the hidden information
2010-12-20T19:40:30  <jmcarthur> i'm pretty sure, at least
2010-12-20T19:40:46  <jmcarthur> maybe late game would be more tractable, but that's probably it
2010-12-20T19:41:07  <Zannick> i'd suspect minimax would be mostly okay
2010-12-20T19:41:13  <Zannick> but not terribly
2010-12-20T19:41:21  <Zannick> just assume worst case for all decisions
2010-12-20T19:41:48  <jmcarthur> assume that every enemy is exactly what you don't want it to be?
2010-12-20T19:41:59  <jmcarthur> i think that would probably lead to pretty bad play
2010-12-20T19:42:06  <Zannick> assume that any enemy that hasn't moved is a bomb unless you're attacking it
2010-12-20T19:42:15  * jmcarthur shrugs
2010-12-20T19:42:18  <Zannick> etc
2010-12-20T19:42:30  <Zannick> yeah, early on the bot would be like "i'm gonna lose no matter what!"
2010-12-20T19:42:50  <Zannick> i haven't played stratego in a while
2010-12-20T19:43:01  <jmcarthur> the only way to win is not to play, by that strategy

2010-12-20T19:55:41  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: the one thing i'm not sure about atm is what should happen when an ant is attacked from an adjacent square and died
2010-12-20T19:56:17  <antimatroid1> atm their harvest just drops onto the ground, but if you walk on top of an enemy ant and kill them, you get their harvest, but not if someone killed hem from attack before you landed on them
2010-12-20T19:56:26  <antimatroid1> even though it was really all the same move

2010-12-20T19:57:39  <jmcarthur> i think the current behavior for adjacent attacks is fine. it's the walk-onto-each-other behavior that i disagree with
2010-12-20T19:57:49  <antimatroid1> what do you think should happen?
2010-12-20T19:57:52  <jmcarthur> i think the food should drop and the winner should have to take the time to pick it up
2010-12-20T19:58:04  <antimatroid1> that's easier and i sort of agree
2010-12-20T19:58:14  <antimatroid1> should the fused ants at least get each others harvest?
2010-12-20T19:58:51  <antimatroid1> i also let ants deposit as much of their harvest as they want each turn, either to base or another ant, should that be down to 1? the  idea there was to speed the game up a bit
2010-12-20T19:59:20  <antimatroid1> i sort of have to do that anyway
2010-12-20T19:59:25  <antimatroid1> otherwise battle resolution gets harder
2010-12-20T19:59:28  <jmcarthur> i'm not convinced that would speed it up, but i am not as familiar with it as you are
2010-12-20T19:59:36  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-12-20T19:59:57  <antimatroid1> well, it's either take you the number of turns for what you have harvest to get them onto the base square, or you can drop it in one turn and keep going
2010-12-20T20:00:13  <jmcarthur> if it takes longer to drop food off at home that means your numbers can't climb as quickly, right? which gives the other player some more opportunity to attack your ants
2010-12-20T20:00:19  <jmcarthur> without being as overwhelmed
2010-12-20T20:00:26  <antimatroid1> that's true
2010-12-20T20:00:28  <jmcarthur> i suspect it might just even out
2010-12-20T20:00:31  <antimatroid1> i do think there are too many ants atm
2010-12-20T20:01:00  <antimatroid1> i'm going to remove deposit amounts for the moment and ability to steal enemies harvest
2010-12-20T20:01:17  <antimatroid1> my engine is really really horrible anyway, i'm hoping j3camero gets one done sometime
2010-12-20T20:01:43  <jmcarthur> just reaching the enemy's home base ends the game? i would have suspected that it needed to be "attacked"
2010-12-20T20:01:48  <jmcarthur> i suppose this is simpler though
2010-12-20T20:02:12  <jmcarthur> *would have thought
2010-12-20T20:02:15  <antimatroid1> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2rPuRDtL_s
2010-12-20T20:02:19  <antimatroid1> my idea for that came here
2010-12-20T20:02:47  <antimatroid1> if your ant spawns on the base that turn, you need more hp than that ant to take it out (if you fuse two full health ants you get a super ant with 10hp)
2010-12-20T20:02:48  <McLeopold> isn't each ant a different instance of a bot?
2010-12-20T20:02:59  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: no, too much overhead
2010-12-20T20:03:13  <antimatroid1> delt0r has a spec that almost approximates that by giving each ant relative information
2010-12-20T20:03:19  <antimatroid1> but it's not compatible with home bases
2010-12-20T20:03:50  <jmcarthur> oh i didn't realize there was fusion
2010-12-20T20:04:18  <antimatroid1> yeah, if two friend ants land on the same square, they fuse
2010-12-20T20:04:24  <antimatroid1> join hp and grains
2010-12-20T20:04:24  <jmcarthur> hmm
2010-12-20T20:04:25  <sigh> he just didn't want to deal with collision resulution
2010-12-20T20:04:37  <sigh> *resolution
2010-12-20T20:04:40  <jmcarthur> that gives me an idea for keeping the ant numbers down without imposing a cap
2010-12-20T20:04:41  <antimatroid1> sigh: no, i was going to have collided ants all die
2010-12-20T20:04:52  <Zannick> jelly ants
2010-12-20T20:05:09  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~quassel@cpc5-heme9-2-0-cust144.9-1.cable.virginmedia.com> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-12-20T20:05:30  <McLeopold> except, # of ants matters
2010-12-20T20:05:47  <antimatroid1> yes, fusing ants is a really bad idea
2010-12-20T20:05:55  <jmcarthur> as ants hold food the amount of food goes down at a (slow?) constant rate per ant. this could encourage the player to keep the number of ants lower
2010-12-20T20:05:59  <antimatroid1> i only added it as it was the best i could think of for colliding ants
2010-12-20T20:06:03  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-12-20T20:06:19  <jmcarthur> i kind of agree
2010-12-20T20:06:41  <antimatroid1> i do think there may be times when trying to invade their base that you might stack
2010-12-20T20:06:52  <antimatroid1> but otherwise, you want to keep as many separate ants as possible
2010-12-20T20:06:52  <McLeopold> So here I go changing the subject.  I think a simplification of a magic card game might be fun.
2010-12-20T20:07:13  <antimatroid1> never played magic, never intended to :P
2010-12-20T20:07:14  <sigh> delt0r had a collision resolution scheme which cancelled conflicting moves
2010-12-20T20:07:20  <sigh> antimatroid1 didn't like that
2010-12-20T20:07:28  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: the obvious fix might be to just allow multiple ants per square
2010-12-20T20:07:32  * antimatroid1 really really doesn't like that
2010-12-20T20:07:44  <McLeopold> Well, you can theme the game in any way, but the mechanics are really fun.
2010-12-20T20:07:46  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: yes, but then bots need to track and ids and work out who to attack
2010-12-20T20:07:48  <antimatroid1> gets a lot harder
2010-12-20T20:08:20  <antimatroid1> delt0r has got another game on the way though that sounds awesome
2010-12-20T20:08:42  <sigh> McLeopold: the downside is anything resembling magic would take a lot of work to balance
2010-12-20T20:09:15  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: where were you a few days ago when i was working out these specs! :P
2010-12-20T20:09:21  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i don't think it would have to be much harder. each square could just store the number of each player's ants currently on it and orders could be given by pairs of source square and direction
2010-12-20T20:09:23  <McLeopold> sigh: I don't think so.  Just start with 1 "land" card and 1 "creature" card and go from there.
2010-12-20T20:09:28  <McLeopold> It would be symmetric.
2010-12-20T20:09:48  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: each ant might have different hp/harvest, you need to know them individually
2010-12-20T20:09:50  <sigh> jmcarthur: delt0r was very against stacking ants on squares
2010-12-20T20:09:52  <Zannick> Magic, haha
2010-12-20T20:09:57  * jmcarthur shrugs
2010-12-20T20:10:03  <antimatroid1> the engine is actually set up with ant ids for frontiers gui, but i think it's harder to deal with as a comptitor
2010-12-20T20:10:06  <jmcarthur> most choices become arbitrary i guess
2010-12-20T20:10:12  <sigh> he said it leads to simpler strategies
2010-12-20T20:10:16  <McLeopold> I would think a ant's move order should be able to fail.
2010-12-20T20:10:22  <sigh> meh, I'll let him argue it out when he sees you
2010-12-20T20:10:36  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: that is delt0rs method
2010-12-20T20:10:42  <antimatroid1> but i would prefer ants to move as told
2010-12-20T20:10:48  * sigh just regurgitates information I heard in the channel
2010-12-20T20:10:54  * sigh doesn't have original thoughts
2010-12-20T20:11:05  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: how about if two ants move to the same square they are blocked, and if they were opponents it also deals damage?
2010-12-20T20:11:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: what's the upside of moving always being successful?
2010-12-20T20:11:27  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: if i move an ant, if it's alive the next turn, it'll be where i expect
2010-12-20T20:11:42  <Zannick> right, but would you expect it to be alive?
2010-12-20T20:11:50  <jmcarthur> you have to get the state either way
2010-12-20T20:11:52  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: that could maybe work, but then like half of your moves might have been blocked by just one of them
2010-12-20T20:11:53  <McLeopold> I think it would be easier to check if the hp is zero
2010-12-20T20:11:58  <antimatroid1> i really really don't like it :)
2010-12-20T20:12:10  <jmcarthur> that would be part of the strategy
2010-12-20T20:12:15  <jmcarthur> not a mere mistake :)
2010-12-20T20:12:26  <antimatroid1> but it's a boring thing to deal with
2010-12-20T20:12:28  <jmcarthur> if half your army is blocked then you need to reroute it
2010-12-20T20:12:30  <antimatroid1> and just annoyign
2010-12-20T20:12:46  <McLeopold> It would be possible to setup a scenario you can't resolve with unsuccessful moves.
2010-12-20T20:12:48  <antimatroid1> with this method you can throw ant armies into each other for battle
2010-12-20T20:12:55  <McLeopold> Like ants moving in a circle.
2010-12-20T20:12:56  <antimatroid1> and start forcing your way through their front lines
2010-12-20T20:12:59  <jmcarthur> maybe less annoying if it was a hex grid instead of squares
2010-12-20T20:13:04  <jmcarthur> then you get more ways to move
2010-12-20T20:13:29  <antimatroid1> how does one store a hex grid?
2010-12-20T20:13:30  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: how would you move *into* that position though?
2010-12-20T20:13:34  <antimatroid1> do you have to just use a graph
2010-12-20T20:13:47  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: you can store it like a normal grid but consider every other row to be slightly shifted
2010-12-20T20:13:59  *** yasith <yasith!~yasith@112.134.122.161> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-20T20:14:01  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: that would be resolved fine, none of the ants move
2010-12-20T20:14:08  <McLeopold> well, assume a line, then antA goes from 2 -> 3 and antB goes from 1 -> 2
2010-12-20T20:14:28  <antimatroid1> yes, you don't check collisions till all moves are made
2010-12-20T20:14:28  <McLeopold> if antA doesn't move, then antB is blocked too
2010-12-20T20:14:30  <antimatroid1> that should be fine
2010-12-20T20:14:41  <McLeopold> you could arrange that example in a circle
2010-12-20T20:15:08  <antimatroid1> but yes, if antC moves into 3, then both A and B are blocked and move back to where they started at 1 and 2, but i hate that
2010-12-20T20:15:28  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: I think there might be a case where a different ant is free to move depending on the order in which to attempt to resolve.
2010-12-20T20:15:30  <jmcarthur> well i g2g
2010-12-20T20:15:50  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: you make all moves, then resolve collisions, it works i think
2010-12-20T20:15:52  <jmcarthur> if you just resolve it atomically it's not that tough
2010-12-20T20:16:10  <jmcarthur> if a resolution screws things up then you fix that recursively
2010-12-20T20:16:27  <jmcarthur> could lead to large chunks of your population getting stuck though
2010-12-20T20:16:27  <antimatroid1> i think fusion and instant fights are cooler
2010-12-20T20:16:44  <antimatroid1> and easier, and better to handle
2010-12-20T20:16:45  <sigh> delt0r's code has a recursive collision resolution implementation
2010-12-20T20:17:10  <sigh> which is completely deterministic, and order-independant
2010-12-20T20:17:26  <McLeopold> IMHO: fusion is stupid
2010-12-20T20:18:25  <antimatroid1> why? if you have 4 ants adjacent to their base, you can walk them all on fuse and own any spawned ant, winning the game
2010-12-20T20:18:39  <antimatroid1> similarly, you can fuse 2 weaker ants on top of an enemy to take them out
2010-12-20T20:18:39  <McLeopold> It just sounds cheezy.
2010-12-20T20:18:52  <antimatroid1> or build a mega ant to push through their ants at their base
2010-12-20T20:19:02  <McLeopold> I have no good math to backup my stupid claim.:)
2010-12-20T20:19:49  <sigh> yeah, fusion doesn't really fit the theme
2010-12-20T20:19:58  <antimatroid1> theme? it's robot ants
2010-12-20T20:19:58  <McLeopold> If we called them "Mech's", then I would be okay with it. :)
2010-12-20T20:20:06  <McLeopold> Or, transformers.
2010-12-20T20:21:20  <McLeopold> cya
2010-12-20T20:21:22  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@65-122-177-90.dia.static.qwest.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-12-20T20:24:07  <antimatroid1> i think the game is less interesting strategy wise if ignoring collision moves too
2010-12-20T20:24:56  <antimatroid1> say you are surrounded by 2 or 3 of them, with ignoring collision moves, you just run away, if you can collide, you will probably try to take one of them out with you
2010-12-20T20:25:15  <antimatroid1> and tey will probably try to move one of their ants if they have 3 next to you or something
2010-12-20T20:27:24  <sigh> i think that's the point, you can set up flanks, barriers, choke points and so on
2010-12-20T20:28:11  <antimatroid1> you can do that now, but you need enough to defend them trying to charge stragiht through you
2010-12-20T20:28:32  <antimatroid1> what if fusions weren't allowed but instant fights were?
2010-12-20T20:28:59  <antimatroid1> it's easy to make sure you never land on the same square as a friend (not so much with fusion in the engine)
2010-12-20T20:29:32  <antimatroid1> not so much with spawning***
2010-12-20T20:29:38  <sigh> that might be ok
2010-12-20T20:29:51  <sigh> just cancel spawning if it conflits
2010-12-20T20:29:58  <sigh> you can't spawn if there is no space
2010-12-20T20:30:03  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'll have to change where i do it
2010-12-20T20:30:05  <sigh> that's valid, I think
2010-12-20T20:30:15  <antimatroid1> it's harder to invade their base now
2010-12-20T20:30:24  <antimatroid1> if you have ants on all sides, you can't just move them all onto the base at once
2010-12-20T20:31:20  <sigh> maybe
2010-12-20T20:31:46  <antimatroid1> i think fusion makes the game better, hmph! :P
2010-12-20T20:31:58  <antimatroid1> and it's robot ants, the storyline can fit
2010-12-20T20:32:02  <sigh> :P
