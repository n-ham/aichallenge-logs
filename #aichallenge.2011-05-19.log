2011-05-19T08:55:34  <Frontier> I overloaded the next JavaScript engine. First time was Opera, now it is Firefox. Also Chromium, Opera and Firefox all render shadow with different algorithms. Firefox' shadow blur is too small, Opera's shadow looks perfect and Chromium trades some quality for speed in diagonal directions.
2011-05-19T08:57:48  <janzert> :(
2011-05-19T08:57:57  <Frontier> Then again Chromium and Firefox do perform an overflow check on pixel colors (JavaScript's only number data type is double), whereas in Opera you have to manually check that after pixel manipulations every color is in the range of 0-255
2011-05-19T08:59:36  <Frontier> I try to use the shadow blur as a quick way to get a linear gradient of width x along a path, but Firefox's anomaly makes it difficult.

2011-05-19T23:15:16  <McLeopold> @later tell Frontier would it be possible to load a map file into the visualizer and get just the zoom and scroll functionality?  I'd like to put together something like /map.php?map=symmetric_10.map and have a view of it with a list of games that have been played on it.
