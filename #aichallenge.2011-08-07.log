2011-08-07T04:47:49  <ralphalph> Hi, I am trying to use the visualizer for Ants. Running play_one_game.cmd gives the "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." as error message. Downloaded Python 2.7, do I need to download/set something else as well?

2011-08-07T07:50:53  <mleise> ralphalph: huh? I wrote the visualizer, what's up?
2011-08-07T07:53:00  <mleise> Oh you have trouble with the batch file. I don't know then. On Vista it works. Can you open a command shell and type python? If not, then make sure your PATH environment variable (either system wide or user) contains the path to the python executable.

2011-08-07T08:00:30  <ralphalph> HAH
2011-08-07T08:00:31  <ralphalph> that worked
2011-08-07T08:00:33  <ralphalph> thank you!
2011-08-07T08:00:38  <ralphalph> setting the enviroment variable
2011-08-07T08:00:39  <ralphalph> :P
2011-08-07T08:01:12  <ralphalph> the visualizer uses the latest rules right?
2011-08-07T08:01:19  <mleise> You're welcome.
2011-08-07T08:02:06  <mleise> I'm not sure honestly. You are actually talking about the engine, mostly written by McLeopold.
2011-08-07T08:03:40  <mleise> But I assume the downloadable package it uses the latest rules. At least I haven't heard of any changes recently.

2011-08-07T09:10:48  <ralphalph> Ok, now my only problem is that I don't know how to make it run a C# bot
2011-08-07T09:12:03  <ralphalph> If I just try to run it specifying "csharp %~dp0MyBot.cs" it'll throw "SandboxError: Failed to start ['csharp', './MyBot.cs']"
2011-08-07T09:12:23  <ralphalph> im guessing somehow i should register a C# compiler to the visualizer?
2011-08-07T09:23:20  <antimatroid> ralphalph: is c# compiled? you should just be able to use something like "mybot.exe"
2011-08-07T09:31:50  <ralphalph> antimatroid: Right :] Thanks, works.
