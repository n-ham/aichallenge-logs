2010-12-13T00:35:07  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure the rotation of the board is necessary
2010-12-13T00:35:13  <antimatroid1> (i'm back)
2010-12-13T00:36:29  <sigh> I meant rotation as a symettry
2010-12-13T00:38:50  <antimatroid1> yeah okay
2010-12-13T00:38:57  <antimatroid1> so i can remove the rotation at the end?
2010-12-13T00:39:07  <antimatroid1> i'm going to write that function to scan linear lines between homes
2010-12-13T00:39:09  <sigh> sure
2010-12-13T00:39:19  <sigh> what for?
2010-12-13T00:39:32  <antimatroid1> well, diagonal, vertical and horizontal
2010-12-13T00:39:37  <antimatroid1> to see how often it aligns
2010-12-13T00:39:38  <sigh> ah yup
2010-12-13T00:39:46  <sigh> we only really care if it aligns all the time
2010-12-13T00:39:58  <sigh> obviously aligning at random times is fine ;P
2010-12-13T00:40:20  <sigh> but yeah, that function is good... saves having to think through the math
2010-12-13T00:41:03  <antimatroid1> wait, do i want to rotate the board randomly up to 3 times?
2010-12-13T00:41:09  <sigh> o_O
2010-12-13T00:41:29  <antimatroid1> bah, i'm confused, i'll play around :)
2010-12-13T00:41:56  <sigh> rotations lie in a group so once should be enough :P

2010-12-13T00:46:45  <janzert> but apparently the file has been removed from the server
2010-12-13T00:47:36  <janzert> also it looks like none of them were actually used in the final contest so I can't point you at examples either :(

2010-12-13T00:48:33  <sigh> janzert: what was special about the tron generator?
2010-12-13T00:49:24  <antimatroid1> yeah?
2010-12-13T00:49:31  <antimatroid1> it didn't have wrapped walls either
2010-12-13T00:49:48  <janzert> one thing is in addition to the "random" wall maps like anti's current generator makes it also made maze like maps and maps with long straight walls randomly laid out
2010-12-13T00:49:59  <janzert> antimatroid1: right but it should be easy to adapt that
2010-12-13T00:50:06  <sigh> ah
2010-12-13T00:50:25  <antimatroid1> that's easy to do
2010-12-13T00:50:33  <sigh> I was going to suggest looking at a maze generator, but I think this random approach gives a more natural feels
2010-12-13T00:50:38  <janzert> antimatroid1: I think maybe your current requirement that *every* non-wall cell be reachable may be too strong
2010-12-13T00:50:39  <sigh> *feel
2010-12-13T00:50:52  <antimatroid1> janzert: what do you mean?
2010-12-13T00:51:09  <janzert> sure, it should all be easy to redo but looking at the other one might have been useful for you
2010-12-13T00:51:10  <antimatroid1> in fact, you can run into every wall if you want
2010-12-13T00:51:42  <janzert> it should be fine to generate maps where sections are unreachable so long as the two bases are still connected
2010-12-13T00:52:00  <antimatroid1> but then it's a waste of space?
2010-12-13T00:52:08  <janzert> might want to make sure only a certain percentage is unreachable of course
2010-12-13T00:52:13  <sigh> janzert: thats what he originally had :P

2010-12-13T00:59:57  <antimatroid1> cause resources get put in closed off regions
2010-12-13T01:00:40  <janzert> ants see through walls right?
2010-12-13T01:01:00  <janzert> i.e. visions is strictly limited by distance

2010-12-13T01:01:21  <sigh> haha... I had an idea... put nice resources in the closed off areas and allow people to dig
2010-12-13T01:01:24  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/9BKCYLIz
2010-12-13T01:01:39  <antimatroid1> janzert: i wanted to have them not see through walls, delt0r thinks it's better to
2010-12-13T01:01:42  <antimatroid1> what are your thoughts?
2010-12-13T01:02:02  <antimatroid1> it's not hard to paint out each players visible region with walls blocking sight and returning what they can see
2010-12-13T01:02:06  <janzert> if ants can see through I would go ahead and put resources in the closed off region so ants need to get smart enough to know when the resource is unreachable
2010-12-13T01:02:32  <janzert> hmm, not really sure which would be more interesting
2010-12-13T01:02:34  <antimatroid1> yeah, actually that could make it cool, i'll leave it like that
2010-12-13T01:03:04  <janzert> see through is probably a lot easier to deal with all around

2010-12-13T01:03:58  <sigh> :)
2010-12-13T01:04:06  <antimatroid1> what do you think should happen when opponent ants try to move into the same square?
2010-12-13T01:04:12  <antimatroid1> delt0r and i don't agree on that one
2010-12-13T01:04:31  <antimatroid1> he wants the engine to resolve those moves and have neither ant move, I say let them fight each other to death there and then
2010-12-13T01:04:36  <sigh> I think it should segfault and crash the server
2010-12-13T01:05:19  <janzert> I think a lot of that really should be resolved with playtesting :)
2010-12-13T01:05:57  <antimatroid1> that's the plan, but i think if people have to consider resolving moves that may not go through, it becomes a lot harder
2010-12-13T01:07:25  <janzert> I rather like fight to the death, but it might have unforeseen problems. It's really hard to get a good feel for the dynamics without seeing games played :)
2010-12-13T01:07:46  <antimatroid1> i don't want it to be the only method of fighting, otherwise i don't think many fights will occur
2010-12-13T01:08:21  <janzert> yeah, I don't really like bullets but there needs to be some method of ranged damage I think
2010-12-13T01:08:28  <janzert> maybe call it acid spit :P
2010-12-13T01:08:34  <antimatroid1> it would be good if the game dynamics went along the lines of start: collect resources and build up grains at home base, middle: go explore the map for them and scope things out end: epic battle while trying to charge each others home base
2010-12-13T01:10:12  <antimatroid1> acid spit is cooler than bullets, another option is you can "hit" another ant that can be reached in x moves
2010-12-13T01:10:22  <antimatroid1> which gets processed before moves
2010-12-13T01:10:39  <antimatroid1> with acid spit
2010-12-13T01:10:45  <janzert> or maybe ranged attack shouldn't just travel in straight lines but be more like a mortar lob that can go to any destination within a certain range and cause a small radius of damage
2010-12-13T01:11:18  <antimatroid1> i like that
2010-12-13T01:11:24  <antimatroid1> you give it the distance it travels
2010-12-13T01:11:29  <antimatroid1> and it has a set blast radius
2010-12-13T01:11:37  <janzert> but I'll let you guys work it all out, I really should stay out of this one :/
2010-12-13T01:11:39  <antimatroid1> and distance is capped
2010-12-13T01:12:09  <delt0r_> Wibble
2010-12-13T01:12:15  <antimatroid1> and you get hp of 5-distance to centre of blast hp taken off
2010-12-13T01:12:53  <sigh> wibble?
2010-12-13T01:13:32  <delt0r_> sigh: you don't watch blackadder?

2010-12-13T01:14:10  <sigh> I haven't seen all of it :P
2010-12-13T01:14:46  <delt0r_> well the last episode of blackadder goes forth has the wibble reference...
2010-12-13T01:14:53  <delt0r_> I let you you tube
2010-12-13T01:14:55  <delt0r_> it
2010-12-13T01:15:30  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: it sounds like you really just want a RTS rather than "army ants"
2010-12-13T01:15:49  <antimatroid1> isn't this meant to be an rts like game?
2010-12-13T01:16:03  <antimatroid1> i really don't like the cancelling of moves
2010-12-13T01:16:10  <antimatroid1> that makes it way harder to work out what moves you can make
2010-12-13T01:18:28  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: I'm not overly set on "firing" stuff, just "attack" ant in next square is fine, but i really think oppoents should be able to land in the same square and one (or both) dies off
2010-12-13T01:19:19  <delt0r_> stacking always results in the same tatics in all RTS games that have it. Stack when ever you can --always
2010-12-13T01:20:01  <delt0r_> while no stacking permit more interesting formations and less "logic"  (ie 3 way + n way stacks from both temes)
2010-12-13T01:20:03  <delt0r_> teams
2010-12-13T01:20:47  <antimatroid1> sigh: i've actually kind of warmed up to krudd since he got the boot, you?
2010-12-13T01:21:09  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: I expect it to be fairly easy to avoid stacking
2010-12-13T01:21:23  <antimatroid1> although if large groups come across each other, than can charge into battle which will be over faster
2010-12-13T01:21:25  <sigh> antimatroid1: well he's saying stuff that makes sense now
2010-12-13T01:21:33  <sigh> and not running away from the media
2010-12-13T01:21:35  <antimatroid1> sigh: even before this last week
2010-12-13T01:22:02  <sigh> honestly haven't been paying attention to him in the meantime
2010-12-13T01:27:33  <antimatroid1> does anything need to be passed at the very start of the game other than map dimensions, turns in a game and maxt time per turn?

2010-12-13T01:29:32  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-12-13T01:30:23  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: But if you permit stacking you can't stop it... so i stack *all* my ants when ever i can
2010-12-13T01:30:42  <delt0r_> It will always be the better strat... we have seen this many times in other RTS
2010-12-13T01:30:57  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: i'm saying make two friend ants stacked be an invalid move and loss of game
2010-12-13T01:31:13  <antimatroid1> if two opponent ants land on the same square, only one (if any) can be there after they battle
2010-12-13T01:31:23  <delt0r_> well now you have ---stacking kinda with extra rules and logic ... for what?
2010-12-13T01:31:28  <delt0r_> what does it add?
2010-12-13T01:31:40  <antimatroid1> it means you don't have to worry about your moves not actually being implemented
2010-12-13T01:31:49  <delt0r_> ??
2010-12-13T01:32:08  <antimatroid1> if two oppoent ants try to move into the same square, you want that to not count for either of them?
2010-12-13T01:32:21  <antimatroid1> but then your ant isn't goint to be where it was expected if it's still alive
2010-12-13T01:32:23  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-13T01:32:29  <delt0r_> so
2010-12-13T01:32:32  <antimatroid1> which is also more work to handle when working out possible moves
2010-12-13T01:32:40  <antimatroid1> it's easier if you let them land there and fight to death
2010-12-13T01:32:56  <delt0r_> if there are *any* invalid moves... then this is something you need *anyway*
2010-12-13T01:33:18  <antimatroid1> no, you just never move one of your ants to where another one is
2010-12-13T01:33:18  <delt0r_> and if two freindlys can't stack then that situation happens anyway
2010-12-13T01:33:20  <antimatroid1> that's easy
2010-12-13T01:33:41  <antimatroid1> and then you may move an ant to any empty square, and provided it's stil alive next turn, it will be there
2010-12-13T01:33:49  <delt0r_> really?
2010-12-13T01:34:02  <antimatroid1> what's complicated?
2010-12-13T01:34:11  <antimatroid1> you can only ever have two opponent ants land in the same square
2010-12-13T01:34:14  <delt0r_> (0,0)-> 0,1 <-(0,2)
2010-12-13T01:34:43  <delt0r_> ops these two ants did not communicate that they both planed to move to the same square
2010-12-13T01:34:47  <delt0r_> now what happens
2010-12-13T01:34:54  <antimatroid1> same team or not?
2010-12-13T01:34:55  <delt0r_> these are on the same team
2010-12-13T01:34:57  <antimatroid1> they lose
2010-12-13T01:35:04  <delt0r_> ?? WTF
2010-12-13T01:35:05  <antimatroid1> if all ants are the one process, they all share the same information
2010-12-13T01:35:32  <antimatroid1> it shouldn't be hard to make sure you never move where another one of your ants is going to be
2010-12-13T01:35:40  <delt0r_> no--they only see local info... ant A doesn't know anthing about ant B without some serious pattern matching

2010-12-13T01:39:01  <antimatroid1> not really, make a vector of ants, go through and make a random valid move for each one (random bot) and return the moves
2010-12-13T01:39:03  <janzert> delt0r_: I think you're imagining the information being given to the ants in a completely different way that antimatroid1 is doing it
2010-12-13T01:39:36  <janzert> none of the information is being given from an ants point of view for his proposal
2010-12-13T01:39:37  <delt0r_> the idea was "agents" --ie close to the ant per process
2010-12-13T01:39:53  <delt0r_> but in one process for implentation reasons
2010-12-13T01:40:08  <antimatroid1> so you want to pass each ant relative information?

2010-12-13T01:40:26  <delt0r_> however its still very abitary to have "freindies" move onto the same square as illegal but not foes
2010-12-13T01:40:44  <delt0r_> what if 2 guys try to attack the same ant...
2010-12-13T01:40:56  <delt0r_> either let stacking happen --or don't
2010-12-13T01:41:05  <delt0r_> but a mix is worse that either
2010-12-13T01:41:18  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: I do only pass relative information
2010-12-13T01:41:20  <janzert> you could instead just always have just the strongest ant survive no matter if they are same team or not :)

2010-12-13T01:42:13  <delt0r_> still seems very lame... "locked" combat is very artifical... i can't retreat or break off the attack... it just doesn't seem to lead to anything interesting
2010-12-13T01:43:07  <janzert> yeah, there should be a separate /normal/ way of attacking
2010-12-13T01:45:25  <delt0r_> anyway I have a first cut ready to show people...
2010-12-13T01:45:45  <delt0r_> its sloppy code... but at least we can "see" how it works...
2010-12-13T01:48:42  <antimatroid1> delt0r: if two ants attack the same enemy, it loses that many hp, if it goes below 0, the ant dies
2010-12-13T01:49:31  <antimatroid1> you can't do relative information with the home base idea
2010-12-13T01:49:46  <antimatroid1> i originally wanted to do that but threw it out when i liked home base
2010-12-13T01:50:39  <delt0r_> but since they are on the same sqaure--you now have 2 friendlies on the same square
2010-12-13T01:50:55  <delt0r_> its just seems very inconsitant...
2010-12-13T01:51:07  <antimatroid1> no, i'm saying don't let two friends go on the same square

2010-12-13T01:51:35  <antimatroid1> you could do that with ides
2010-12-13T01:51:37  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: relative info is easy... "collision" stuff is also easy
2010-12-13T01:51:38  <antimatroid1> ids*
2010-12-13T01:51:39  <antimatroid1> and relative
2010-12-13T01:52:28  <antimatroid1> how are you having new ants made atm? and what's the decision rule for where they spawn?
2010-12-13T01:52:30  <delt0r_> but that will kill friendlys.. seriously.. if I can share space with the enemny why not a friend... its not logical
2010-12-13T01:52:51  <delt0r_> just spawn everything randomly... good for basic debug
2010-12-13T01:53:12  <delt0r_> and you get an idea without too many tedious details
2010-12-13T01:53:58  <antimatroid1> when do you get a new ant?
2010-12-13T01:56:03  <delt0r_> A new ant is "born" in the same place as the parent. Its an "egg" till the parent leaves the square. Then it spaws..
2010-12-13T01:56:16  <delt0r_> its a hack, but can be easily changed
2010-12-13T01:56:24  <antimatroid1> that works
2010-12-13T01:56:25  <delt0r_> permits easy swaming in random maps
2010-12-13T01:56:36  <delt0r_> so you can see dynamics better
2010-12-13T01:56:47  <delt0r_> its not bad... very "alife" like
2010-12-13T01:57:15  <delt0r_> you can see stratagies that could work well... and see what does not
2010-12-13T01:57:28  <delt0r_> my current bot ignores walls
2010-12-13T01:57:31  <antimatroid1> i really like the home base idea though
2010-12-13T01:57:36  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-13T01:57:38  <delt0r_> easy to add
2010-12-13T01:57:56  <delt0r_> don't thinks it changes the basic dynamics...
2010-12-13T01:57:57  <antimatroid1> not really, if ants spawn there, they all know the same thing
2010-12-13T01:58:11  <delt0r_> just adding some comments to the code... then will post
2010-12-13T01:58:15  <antimatroid1> or do you want ants to not know where their own home is?
2010-12-13T01:58:28  <delt0r_> no.. thats fine
2010-12-13T01:58:39  <delt0r_> but tracking state is not as easy as it sounds...
2010-12-13T01:58:59  <delt0r_> currently ant "ids" are only valid for a round...
2010-12-13T01:59:10  <delt0r_> so you can't easily know if its the same ant
2010-12-13T01:59:18  <delt0r_> may fix that before release
2010-12-13T01:59:21  <antimatroid1> pattern match the walls, easy
2010-12-13T01:59:48  <delt0r_> well not really... we don't want the starter packs to be a lot of code --just to get started really
2010-12-13T02:00:01  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-12-13T02:00:03  <delt0r_> that way more langs get added faster
2010-12-13T02:00:15  <delt0r_> A* seems like it would be needed
2010-12-13T02:00:24  <delt0r_> with walls that is
2010-12-13T02:00:37  <antimatroid1> i don't think one will get away with just one tree
2010-12-13T02:01:10  <delt0r_> well if an ant can only see say 10x10... then you only need to do the path finding on that
2010-12-13T02:01:26  <delt0r_> hell you only really need the "next move" part
2010-12-13T02:01:26  <antimatroid1> that's easy, paint the grid
2010-12-13T02:01:32  <delt0r_> yea
2010-12-13T02:05:37  <antimatroid1> i don't see how you can have relative information be anything other than a tedious annoyance with extra overhead with home bases
2010-12-13T02:05:48  <delt0r_> ??
2010-12-13T02:06:00  <delt0r_> you just don't give coords.
2010-12-13T02:06:19  <antimatroid1> well, each bot is just going to work out where they are relative to home base, then translate everything to the same coordinates
2010-12-13T02:06:37  <antimatroid1> unless
2010-12-13T02:06:40  <antimatroid1> you rotate the maps too
2010-12-13T02:07:11  <delt0r_> well it stops even being "agent" relealted if you give absolute data
2010-12-13T02:07:42  <antimatroid1> yeah, my point is i think it's impossible to do relative and home bases
2010-12-13T02:12:56  <delt0r_> I don't
2010-12-13T02:13:09  <delt0r_> just don't give coords... whats the problem?

2010-12-13T02:15:04  <antimatroid1> how do they know where home is without coords?
2010-12-13T02:15:12  <antimatroid1> where is mcleopold these days
2010-12-13T02:15:28  <antimatroid1> it would be cool to get him to add revised revisions of an engine to a tcp
2010-12-13T02:15:30  <delt0r_> thats the point... thats what the "agent" code need to do
2010-12-13T02:26:15  <antimatroid1> okay, i'm with you, i say have the home hole, but ants get spawned randomly and given a relative coord of home base and spawned ants need to be at least a certain distance from the enemies home base
2010-12-13T02:26:25  <antimatroid1> i can make the map generator for that quite easily
2010-12-13T02:26:55  <delt0r_> just wait to you see all this in action.
2010-12-13T02:27:08  <delt0r_> you may not like it anyway...
2010-12-13T02:27:14  <delt0r_> or others may not
2010-12-13T02:27:18  <delt0r_> we will see
2010-12-13T02:27:20  <janzert> if the ants are given relative coords to the home base that simply becomes the origin for the sides global coord system
2010-12-13T02:27:26  <delt0r_> or folks can hack the code
2010-12-13T02:27:54  <delt0r_> janzert: yes.. If you can see the base --you see the base... otherwise you know nothing...
2010-12-13T02:28:14  <antimatroid1> janzert: yes, but you don't necessarily know the path there
2010-12-13T02:28:22  <antimatroid1> so your ants at least have to find each other
2010-12-13T02:28:26  <delt0r_> note that in my current implentation... you can't really "know" that you moved or not wihout checking the terrain
2010-12-13T02:28:59  <antimatroid1> yeah, home base completely throws out relative coords
2010-12-13T02:29:17  <antimatroid1> janzert: one option is to make it harder to match by rotating bots relative view
2010-12-13T02:29:50  <antimatroid1> and inverting etc. then reverting those when receiving its move
2010-12-13T02:30:13  <janzert> why bother? it seems like it only makes an artificial barrier for newbies
2010-12-13T02:30:42  <delt0r_> you could be right janzert
2010-12-13T02:30:54  <delt0r_> giving coords does make it easier
2010-12-13T02:31:00  <delt0r_> and we want easier
2010-12-13T02:31:19  <delt0r_> but i remained unconvinced ants is the best idea...
2010-12-13T02:32:21  <antimatroid1> so agents are incompatible with home bases

2010-12-13T02:41:44  <antimatroid1> this isn't in the forums
2010-12-13T02:41:51  <antimatroid1> Palmik: not necessarily
2010-12-13T02:41:56  <antimatroid1> it's an option for the new challenge
2010-12-13T02:42:09  <Palmik> I see :)
2010-12-13T02:42:39  <sigh> antimatroid1: ok, can you tell me clearly the difference bw individual agent ants and home bases
2010-12-13T02:42:44  <sigh> pretend I don't know anything
2010-12-13T02:43:24  <janzert> I have a feeling it doesn't matter if you have home bases or not, each ant will just build an individual map and when it comes within sight of another friendly merge maps
2010-12-13T02:43:41  <antimatroid1> janzert: i agree
2010-12-13T02:43:50  <antimatroid1> hence why it might just be easier to drop agents
2010-12-13T02:43:54  <sigh> yay, I'm not needed
2010-12-13T02:44:01  <antimatroid1> sigh: hang on
2010-12-13T02:44:02  <antimatroid1> ants don't really know which one is which if they are fed relative information about their position, so they are sort of like individual agents, but when
2010-12-13T02:44:27  <antimatroid1> they are given a home base, they can always fill information in on the same map
2010-12-13T02:44:37  <antimatroid1> before they don't know how far away they are from each other
2010-12-13T02:45:34  <sigh> ok, so the purpose of the home base is that it gives the ants a common origin?

2010-12-13T02:47:23  <antimatroid1> all rules do
2010-12-13T02:47:29  <antimatroid1> the game is constantly changing at this point
2010-12-13T02:47:40  <antimatroid1> it's a matter of finding what will result in the most interesting competition
2010-12-13T02:48:20  <antimatroid1> it needs to be easy enough that people can pick up the rules fairly quickly
2010-12-13T02:48:21  <sigh> meh... I'm still confused about what you are asking
2010-12-13T02:48:48  <sigh> I don't know if you are discussing what ants see, or how they communicate, or how they win
2010-12-13T02:48:58  <sigh> I'll just lurk a bit
2010-12-13T02:49:53  <antimatroid1> i like having the ants spawn from home and having a collective intelligence
2010-12-13T02:50:18  <antimatroid1> the other option requires ants to build their own information and match it up with other friend ants when they see them
2010-12-13T02:50:47  <antimatroid1> the second option just doesn't work with home bases, so it's a forced choice
2010-12-13T02:51:46  <antimatroid1> with the first option, you may have two ants just outside each others field of vision, and they'd know, with the second option, they wouldn't be able to distinguish between that and being complete opposite sides of the board
2010-12-13T02:52:33  <sigh> so, what I said before: the purpose of the home base is that it gives the ants a common origin?
2010-12-13T02:53:07  <antimatroid1> it has more purposes, with the first option, ants are spawned there and you have to take harvest back there, with the second option you just have to make sure an enemy ant doesn't get on it
2010-12-13T02:53:24  <sigh> ok, i see
2010-12-13T02:54:07  <antimatroid1> i see a lot of pattern matching being done with the second option instead of implementing cool strategies
2010-12-13T02:54:20  <sigh> yeah
2010-12-13T02:54:45  <sigh> also, the first 30 moves of the game will just be bumbling around
2010-12-13T02:54:56  <antimatroid1> and once you see a friend ant, you will stay together
2010-12-13T02:55:28  <antimatroid1> both can be tried though
2010-12-13T02:55:37  <antimatroid1> we need mcleopold for a tcp server once an engine is made

2010-12-13T02:57:04  <sigh> json for what? everything?
2010-12-13T02:57:14  <janzert> except then you need json libraries for all languages

2010-12-13T02:57:23  <sigh> not every language has json in the stdlib like python :P
2010-12-13T02:57:37  <delt0r_> so there need to be a more "formal" spec at some point.. delegated to the organizes who can make executive decisions
2010-12-13T02:57:42  <antimatroid1> it's good being able to write a bot without any additional libraries
2010-12-13T02:58:04  <sigh> I think json for the game output for visualiser is a good idea though
2010-12-13T02:58:13  <delt0r_> its better to be able to change the format a little without breaking backward compatablity
2010-12-13T02:58:31  <delt0r_> anyway s-expresions or JSON is easy to parse without a lib too
2010-12-13T02:58:58  <delt0r_> The idea is the server is going to be better set up to support libarays
2010-12-13T02:59:29  <antimatroid1> i still don't see any reason to move away from standar input/output for communictation with the engine
2010-12-13T02:59:34  <antimatroid1> standard*
2010-12-13T02:59:47  <antimatroid1> if you pass game parameters at the start and hardcode that into starter packages
2010-12-13T02:59:52  <antimatroid1> they can be adjusted without people bitching
2010-12-13T03:00:18  <delt0r_> you still do that
2010-12-13T03:00:27  <janzert> json is orthogonal to stdin/out
2010-12-13T03:00:29  <delt0r_> just with more formally formatted strings
2010-12-13T03:00:55  <antimatroid1> i just throw all my input into a string stream
2010-12-13T03:01:07  <antimatroid1> and then read it into whatever variables i like
2010-12-13T03:01:09  <delt0r_> even if its not JSON (a good idea really) more structure would be good
2010-12-13T03:01:19  <delt0r_> my format is as hacky as hell
2010-12-13T03:01:20  <antimatroid1> as long as i can continue doing that, i'm happy
2010-12-13T03:02:16  <sigh> I like the idea of JSON but I don't think it will be nice for the other languages
2010-12-13T03:02:48  <janzert> key value pairs with unknown keys specified as being ignored is probably sufficient for our purposes and a whole lot easier to parse than json
2010-12-13T03:03:08  <sigh> agree ^^

2010-12-13T03:03:33  <delt0r_> i had a look .. Every lang i have heard of has a JSON lib for it
2010-12-13T03:03:44  <delt0r_> including haskell
2010-12-13T03:03:58  <delt0r_> scheme, lisp
2010-12-13T03:04:06  <delt0r_> ok --so not ook!
2010-12-13T03:04:25  <delt0r_> but anyone using ook should be able to write their own

2010-12-13T03:05:16  <janzert> but it does mean an extra library everyone has to get working (including us on the servers and we better pick the library everyone likes for that language :})
2010-12-13T03:06:06  <delt0r_> janzert: I understood that the server this time round will support general user libs better.. But yes this was my objection too...
2010-12-13T03:06:21  <delt0r_> not all langs are late binding like java...
2010-12-13T03:07:01  <delt0r_> and C/C++ compiler options are not always straightforward...
2010-12-13T03:07:11  <janzert> so far as I've seen no work has been done on changing the server setup in any way :/
2010-12-13T03:07:34  <delt0r_> I figured
2010-12-13T03:07:41  <janzert> but there *is* a lot that could be done there to make things better for sure
2010-12-13T03:07:43  <delt0r_> we all have day jobs I guess
2010-12-13T03:07:55  <antimatroid1> to be fair, nobody said they'd do anything by now
2010-12-13T03:09:03  <janzert> so far as I know I think I'm the only one that has explicitly said what I'll do for the next contest and that is that I won't be doing anything :(
2010-12-13T03:09:38  <janzert> which is why I should stop butting in :/
2010-12-13T03:10:34  <antimatroid1> you aren't really butting in
2010-12-13T03:10:38  <antimatroid1> it's all just ideas atm
2010-12-13T03:10:40  <antimatroid1> mostly
2010-12-13T03:12:08  <janzert> probably the biggest need for the next contest is someone willing to step in and "champion" it
2010-12-13T03:12:57  <antimatroid1> shotgun not :)
2010-12-13T03:23:52  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: what are your current thoughts on relative vs home base?
2010-12-13T03:24:01  <delt0r_> none.
2010-12-13T03:24:07  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to throw together a sample bot, but it sort of depends on that
2010-12-13T03:24:07  <delt0r_> I am posting now
2010-12-13T03:24:25  <delt0r_> then i am working like a madman till thursday
2010-12-13T03:24:38  <delt0r_> give my talk and back to xmass parties
2010-12-13T03:24:47  <antimatroid1> :)
2010-12-13T03:28:35  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure about having these blocked off regions on the map
2010-12-13T03:28:53  <antimatroid1> before there were quite a few times you would see something interesting looking through walls with no easy path to it
2010-12-13T03:29:55  <antimatroid1> i can increase the density of walls

2010-12-13T04:10:51  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: :)
2010-12-13T04:14:18  <antimatroid1> delt0r_: what happens if you move off where an egg is and someone else moves there? does it have to wait before hatching?
2010-12-13T04:14:24  <antimatroid1> what if someone else tries to then lay an egg?
2010-12-13T04:14:26  <delt0r_> yes
2010-12-13T04:14:38  <delt0r_> all "eggs" wait
2010-12-13T04:14:44  <antimatroid1> okay cool
2010-12-13T04:14:51  <delt0r_> they then hatch in order they are laied
2010-12-13T04:15:10  <delt0r_> again this is more of a "easy to implement" than a "good idea"
2010-12-13T04:15:33  <antimatroid1> i personally think the relative infromation wont give a more interesting game
2010-12-13T04:15:51  <antimatroid1> but that will become more apparent with time
2010-12-13T04:15:56  <antimatroid1> well, whichever one is better that is

2010-12-13T04:19:31  <antimatroid1> oh wait, nevermind
2010-12-13T04:19:40  <antimatroid1> i misread the command line argument
2010-12-13T04:20:30  <antimatroid1> looks cool to me
2010-12-13T04:21:02  <antimatroid1> can i edit the code of a jar file? or could i look at your code and i'll make a non-relative one
2010-12-13T04:21:28  <delt0r_> The idea is that you can hack it
2010-12-13T04:21:42  <delt0r_> compiling java is much easy than C or C++
2010-12-13T04:22:05  <delt0r_> I don't use reflection so it finds everything it needs and compiles it for you more or less
2010-12-13T04:22:13  <delt0r_> even if you dont' want to use an ide
2010-12-13T04:22:47  <antimatroid1> its fun to watch
2010-12-13T04:23:05  <delt0r_> I liked planet wars more tbh
2010-12-13T04:23:43  <antimatroid1> can you attack diagonally?
2010-12-13T04:23:53  <antimatroid1> i think it'd be cool if you can move diagonally, but not attack diagonally
2010-12-13T04:23:58  <antimatroid1> so hide in sections of walls
2010-12-13T04:24:12  <delt0r_> yes--diagonal attacks and movement
2010-12-13T04:24:18  <delt0r_> its was just easier in the end
2010-12-13T04:26:46  <sigh> wouldn't it make more sense to be able to attack diagonally but not move diagonally?
2010-12-13T04:26:56  <sigh> than vice versa?
2010-12-13T04:27:03  <antimatroid1> possibly
2010-12-13T04:27:11  <antimatroid1> i prefer no diagonal movement
2010-12-13T04:27:18  <antimatroid1> it makes the maps more cave like
2010-12-13T04:27:19  <delt0r_> like some kind of pawn

2010-12-13T04:41:21  <antimatroid1> not mine

2010-12-13T04:46:46  <sigh> it finally made red win :)
2010-12-13T04:46:52  <delt0r_> It is because attack ignores food too much

2010-12-13T05:12:16  <delt0r_> the idea is that its easier for learners to get started

2010-12-13T05:13:17  <antimatroid1> i think an ant should lose if it makes a move into a wall for example
2010-12-13T05:13:19  <delt0r_> It should warn you when its outright illegal

2010-12-13T05:14:06  <delt0r_> whatever
2010-12-13T05:14:19  <sigh> :)
2010-12-13T05:16:34  <sigh> haha: "for some reason people think that collision prevention is really hard"
2010-12-13T05:17:24  <delt0r_> oh dear
2010-12-13T05:17:32  <delt0r_> sometimes i write odd comments
2010-12-13T05:17:51  <delt0r_> there was a story about a suasage in one of my projects
2010-12-13T05:18:09  <sigh> o_O
2010-12-13T05:19:56  <sigh> but is that collision resolution fair?
2010-12-13T05:20:02  <delt0r_> yes
2010-12-13T05:20:20  <delt0r_> in that its 100% deterministic.
2010-12-13T05:20:35  <delt0r_> and nothing has a "preference" over someone else
2010-12-13T05:21:15  <sigh> but the order that the ants are processed matters?
2010-12-13T05:21:23  <delt0r_> No it does not
2010-12-13T05:21:46  <delt0r_> The collisions from the first part of move are *not* cleared
2010-12-13T05:21:54  <sigh> hmm... I guess I'll read a bit more closely
2010-12-13T05:22:21  <delt0r_> once something is moved to its orginal position is left there (the collide map is updated)
2010-12-13T05:22:58  <delt0r_> so all things that move and then collide are moved back.
2010-12-13T05:24:23  <sigh> ah, i see
2010-12-13T05:24:33  <sigh> tricksy
2010-12-13T05:24:42  <delt0r_> I could have writen it more clearly.
2010-12-13T05:24:54  <delt0r_> but its a well know method for this sort of problem
2010-12-13T05:25:17  <sigh> fair enough... I don't know much about this stuff

2010-12-13T07:05:51  <antimatroid1> yes, i would much prefer that

2010-12-13T07:08:19  <antimatroid1> writing a start bot for c++
2010-12-13T07:08:52  <sigh> :)
2010-12-13T07:09:06  <antimatroid1> for my version of the game i'm considering the following starter strategy.. what do you guys think..
2010-12-13T07:11:12  <antimatroid1> (store path back to home for each ant)
2010-12-13T07:11:14  <antimatroid1> 1. if an enemy is adjacent attack or enemy home base
2010-12-13T07:11:14  <antimatroid1> 2. if on grains and can carry more, harvest
2010-12-13T07:11:14  <antimatroid1> 3. if can't carry more follow path back to home and deposit
2010-12-13T07:11:14  <antimatroid1> 4. move in first direction away from home base, otherwise any direction
2010-12-13T07:11:46  <antimatroid1> path back to home will be the exact path they took to get there, so could be quite inefficient
2010-12-13T07:13:58  <antimatroid1> i think that bot should actually do something, yet leaves most of the work to get a good bot running up to the user
2010-12-13T07:14:03  <antimatroid1> but also easy to get started with
2010-12-13T07:15:13  <delt0r___> i thinks is too early to worry about "starter pack bots"
2010-12-13T07:15:27  <delt0r___> this is more like --lets hack something up and see what works
2010-12-13T07:15:31  <antimatroid1> yes, but that's the type of behaviour i want to see it play with
2010-12-13T07:15:43  <delt0r___> I expect that everything will break a few times
2010-12-13T07:15:57  <delt0r___> and that the organiser may not go with ants anyways..
2010-12-13T07:16:07  <delt0r___> must admit I would a better game
2010-12-13T07:19:44  <antimatroid1> i think the game is cool as

2010-12-13T08:32:11  <delt0r> the problem with these ideas is that one tactic ends up being the only tactic.. ie just fuse till you get UberAnt[tm]

2010-12-13T09:47:22  <antimatroid1> Frontier: I think it'd be cool if the ground looked like the inside of a big ant hole, and the walls darker dirt?
2010-12-13T09:47:54  <antimatroid1> possibly boulders, so there are partial gaps on the visualiser, if we allow diagonal moves

2010-12-13T10:34:19  <antimatroid1> i had a good idea
2010-12-13T10:34:52  <antimatroid1> if we have official tcp and a gui that has easy connection with that, then we could maybe not even allow normal submissions at the start, reducing the number of starter packages at the end
2010-12-13T10:35:08  <antimatroid1> or heavily emphasise people shouldn't upload their code before it's non starter packageish
2010-12-13T10:44:03  <antimatroid1> right, i have a map generator, and a completely untested sample bot, now all i need is an engine and a visualiser

2010-12-13T11:51:34  <Frontier> no, I haven't looked at anything yet.
2010-12-13T11:53:07  <Frontier> And the performance of the canvas visualizer is already going straight down with the added transparent text. In don't know if I should cache that in additional offscreen canvasses
2010-12-13T11:54:40  <Frontier> Do you know what's crazy? Some people have actually written complete GameBoy and Super Nintendo Emulators using the html canvas.
2010-12-13T11:54:52  <antimatroid1> hehe :P
2010-12-13T11:55:06  <Frontier> You can visit their web site, select Super Mario, and there you go.
2010-12-13T11:55:32  <Frontier> oh wait, i guess the synthesizer is missing
2010-12-13T11:57:09  <antimatroid1> Frontier: how are you currently planning to take information?
2010-12-13T11:57:21  <antimatroid1> S row column isWall antPlayer antHP antHarvest squareGrains baseNo
2010-12-13T11:57:22  <antimatroid1> that's what i propose
2010-12-13T11:58:29  <antimatroid1> http://codepad.org/VHkB9yNy that's what i am happy with for input/output with the bots
2010-12-13T11:58:43  <antimatroid1> and i'm done doing work for tonight
2010-12-13T12:01:21  <Frontier> I don't care about the playback format, but I would suggest to keep it small like in planet wars.
2010-12-13T12:02:18  <antimatroid1> if we had max 50x50 maps, then you would have to take in max 2500 lines per turn
2010-12-13T12:02:53  <antimatroid1> output could be probably no more than that with all the walls
2010-12-13T12:03:04  <antimatroid1> actually, has to be less,
2010-12-13T12:04:37  <Frontier> did you take a look at the map size in my visualizer? that's your 32x32 and I think that is already quite large.
2010-12-13T12:05:19  <Frontier> btw, I like when it mixes up snow and desert textures
2010-12-13T12:14:58  <antimatroid1> texture mixtures would be cool
2010-12-13T12:15:06  <Frontier> I would combine the fields grains and isWall (-1 = wall, 0 = empty, +n = grains).
2010-12-13T12:15:11  <antimatroid1> maybe snow/desert and dirt?
2010-12-13T12:15:29  <antimatroid1> i couldn't get your visualiser to load anything
2010-12-13T12:15:32  <Frontier> currently I can only support 2 textures
2010-12-13T12:15:40  <antimatroid1> that's fine
2010-12-13T12:15:44  <Frontier> try the version i just uploaded
2010-12-13T12:15:55  <Frontier> it works in my firefox
2010-12-13T12:16:02  <antimatroid1> same link?
2010-12-13T12:16:24  <Frontier> yeah, same link
2010-12-13T12:16:35  <Frontier> Firefox 3.6.12 Linux that is
2010-12-13T12:16:51  <antimatroid1> i'm on xp
2010-12-13T12:17:42  <antimatroid1> got it, awesome
2010-12-13T12:17:53  <Frontier> antwars reminds me of minesweeper with those bold digits on the squares ^^
2010-12-13T12:18:00  <delt0r> the link?
2010-12-13T12:18:10  <antimatroid1> what engine is it using?

2010-12-13T12:18:31  <Frontier> what engine? damn i coded that myself last nicht ;)
2010-12-13T12:18:36  <Frontier> *night
2010-12-13T12:19:16  <Frontier> delt0r: ftp://marco-leise.homedns.org/ant.zip
2010-12-13T12:19:29  <delt0r> oh--was hoping for a live link
2010-12-13T12:19:59  <antimatroid1> Frontier: are those the home bases specified by my map?
2010-12-13T12:20:01  <Frontier> i COULD set up a web server on my home dsl. the question is: do i want to ^^
2010-12-13T12:20:05  <antimatroid1> cause that isn't right if it is
2010-12-13T12:20:26  <Frontier> antimatroid1: no, I'm just jusing a very basic random placement
2010-12-13T12:21:18  <antimatroid1> ah, cool, i was worried :)
2010-12-13T12:21:20  <Frontier> Maybe you can load files in JavaScript, I don't know. Do you have experience with that?
2010-12-13T12:21:32  <antimatroid1> nope
2010-12-13T12:22:01  <delt0r> Frontier, works in FF but not chrome
2010-12-13T12:22:57  <Frontier> :*( looks like i'm going to install all the browsers that possibly run on my box
2010-12-13T12:23:13  <antimatroid1> chrome and ff are only two that matter :)
2010-12-13T12:23:30  <Frontier> delt0r: how do you like that the background changes each time?
2010-12-13T12:23:32  <delt0r> Perhaps give a few weeks to see if ants is what we pick up...
2010-12-13T12:23:41  <delt0r> Frontier, yea--nice
2010-12-13T12:27:33  <Frontier> antimatroid1: I was working for a browser game company, so I couldn't resist on replicating the backdrops.
2010-12-13T12:27:51  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-13T12:29:12  <Frontier> it is all integer math an pixel by pixel, color by color interpolation between two tiled textures based on a third greyscale lookup texture.
2010-12-13T12:29:52  <antimatroid1> yeah, i did a graphics unit last semester, i have a bit of an idea about textures
2010-12-13T12:30:04  <Frontier> I replaced "/ 255" with ">> 8", because it was a lot faster. So I guess mixing three or more textures could cause trouble
2010-12-13T12:30:15  <antimatroid1> when i say did, i did the two assignments on the day, studied for the exam on the day and went to no classes
2010-12-13T12:30:32  <antimatroid1> so i don't have much of an idea
2010-12-13T12:31:31  *** dmj111 <dmj111!~user@c-98-235-91-228.hsd1.pa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-13T12:32:01  <antimatroid1> can ant colours change up? that would actually be more useful than just aesthetics
2010-12-13T12:32:13  <antimatroid1> i found with planet wars, i was constantly assuming i was a particular colour
2010-12-13T12:32:29  <JamesMG> that hurt my head a few times too
2010-12-13T12:32:34  <Frontier> what does change up mean?
2010-12-13T12:32:36  <JamesMG> "why is my bot doing that?"
2010-12-13T12:32:48  <antimatroid1> so use red blue one game, green red another
2010-12-13T12:33:18  <antimatroid1> JamesMG: have you taken a look at the antwars stuff?
2010-12-13T12:34:11  <Frontier> hmm... I could change up the colors. If we don't use them for communication anyways.
2010-12-13T12:34:25  <spz> Maybe the web server can detect when you're logged in, and you're watching your own game, to always use some special color or default always to red / blue / :)
2010-12-13T12:34:54  <antimatroid1> with my game specification, there is no point in communication, all bots know the same information
2010-12-13T12:35:05  <Frontier> ah right
2010-12-13T12:35:08  <antimatroid1> and you can't have base holes with that
2010-12-13T12:35:18  <antimatroid1> it would make sense with delt0rs specification

2010-12-13T12:44:38  <antimatroid1> read that for me?
2010-12-13T12:46:38  <bhasker> give me a minute
2010-12-13T12:46:53  <antimatroid1> sure
2010-12-13T12:49:35  *** perror <perror!~fleury@aldebaran.labri.fr> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye all !)
2010-12-13T13:00:48  <bhasker> looks good to me,though question why are we restricting visibility for each ant?
2010-12-13T13:01:09  <bhasker> to give like a fog of war effect?
2010-12-13T13:01:18  <antimatroid1> so you don't know what the map looks like at the start
2010-12-13T13:01:19  <antimatroid1> or where their base is
2010-12-13T13:01:19  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-12-13T13:01:41  <bhasker> though a bot can remember the walls and accessible squares over time
2010-12-13T13:01:42  <antimatroid1> if you get an ant onto their home base, you win
2010-12-13T13:01:52  <bhasker> and build a map of its own
2010-12-13T13:01:56  <antimatroid1> bhasker: yes, although that wont be programmed into the starter package
2010-12-13T13:02:08  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-12-13T13:02:10  <antimatroid1> and you will only have old information about some resources
2010-12-13T13:02:25  <bhasker> i guess so ,but walls will not change.
2010-12-13T13:02:34  <bhasker> i am concerned about pathfinding though
2010-12-13T13:02:46  <bhasker> for it to work i guess most will need to remember the map anyway
2010-12-13T13:02:49  <antimatroid1> walls wont change
2010-12-13T13:02:57  <delt0r> god i remeber why i avoid library's sometimes... even google doesn't get it right.
2010-12-13T13:03:07  <bhasker> use search.yahoo.com :)
2010-12-13T13:03:07  <antimatroid1> delt0r: :)
2010-12-13T13:03:15  <antimatroid1> bhasker: nice joke :P
2010-12-13T13:03:27  <delt0r> gson  JSON lib reads a *whole* stream even if you want one json object
2010-12-13T13:03:38  <delt0r> or *checks* for EOF
2010-12-13T13:03:44  <delt0r> after one object
2010-12-13T13:03:55  <delt0r> so much for interleaving
2010-12-13T13:05:37  <antimatroid1> it sounds like a lot of people will hate on it to me
2010-12-13T13:07:11  <delt0r> ??
2010-12-13T13:08:40  <antimatroid1> effort to play around with
2010-12-13T13:11:41  <delt0r> dude I think you may need some sleep
2010-12-13T13:11:51  <antimatroid1> there are two options with letting opponent ants land on top of each other
2010-12-13T13:11:52  <antimatroid1> 1. they can both be on that square, and fight the other ant on that square (with normal fighting)
2010-12-13T13:11:52  <antimatroid1> 2. they both fight to the death there and then
2010-12-13T13:11:55  <antimatroid1> probably :P it's 5am
2010-12-13T13:11:55  <delt0r> you are not making a lot of sens
2010-12-13T13:12:24  <delt0r> but why do they need to be able to land on one another?
2010-12-13T13:12:36  <antimatroid1> because i don't like collision resolution :P
2010-12-13T13:12:38  <delt0r> What does it gain ?
2010-12-13T13:13:01  <antimatroid1> if i make a move and the ant is still alive, i want it to be where i sent it
2010-12-13T13:13:13  <delt0r> and when 2 ants are "locked" in combat and another comes along?
2010-12-13T13:13:21  <antimatroid1> it can also fight
2010-12-13T13:13:26  <delt0r> ??
2010-12-13T13:13:35  <delt0r> Oh yea --soo much easier to implement...
2010-12-13T13:13:56  <delt0r> more edge cases than a 4d hypercube
2010-12-13T13:14:05  <antimatroid1> :p
2010-12-13T13:14:31  <antimatroid1> anyway, i'm going to get some sleep

2010-12-13T22:50:11  <Frontier> wow google chrome is blazing fast with the html canvas
2010-12-13T22:55:54  <antimatroid> :)
2010-12-13T22:57:27  <Zannick> :)
2010-12-13T23:02:14  <Frontier> Firefox is actually buggy sometimes and the slowes of the three browsers I tested (including Opera, which I used for development)
2010-12-13T23:04:54  <Frontier> antimatroid: I am not a big fan of the bullet idea. Couldn't we solve the assymetry with slow turning ants? Say 45° is for free, but every 90° cost you a turn? That way when you attack directly from behind you get a big advantage.
2010-12-13T23:06:31  <Frontier> I'm not sure though if the walls provide enough cover for a sneak attack and the fov is pretty large, so you can usually always manage to face the enemy
2010-12-13T23:09:34  <antimatroid> Frontier: i've dropped bullets
2010-12-13T23:10:37  <antimatroid> i don't allow friend ants to go onto the same square, and if opponent ands land together then they fight to the death, i actually think that fight to the death will make it more interesting
2010-12-13T23:11:01  <antimatroid> it's never the best move to move onto an ant adjacent if it's just you two there
2010-12-13T23:12:25  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.95.232> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2010-12-13T23:13:32  <Frontier> so... how do you solve the symmetry between battles? There are no neutral planets.
2010-12-13T23:14:40  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2010-12-13T23:14:54  <antimatroid> you can have more than one ant that can fight one of theirs
2010-12-13T23:15:04  <antimatroid> or both ants don't have to fight each other when next to each other
2010-12-13T23:15:36  <antimatroid> i only expect opponents to land on the same square when trying to dance around each other, or you are surrounded by more than 1 of them and you can kamakazee into them
2010-12-13T23:16:05  <Frontier> so when I have to ants on seperate squares around an opponent I deal 2 dmg, while the opponent only deals 1 dmg

2010-12-13T23:17:06  <antimatroid> Frontier: your ant must make the move
2010-12-13T23:17:06  <antimatroid> A row col direction
2010-12-13T23:17:12  <antimatroid> so yes, if all ants decide to fight
2010-12-13T23:17:49  <antimatroid> Order of processing of moves:
2010-12-13T23:17:49  <antimatroid> 1. Attacks

2010-12-13T23:17:49  <antimatroid> 5. Moves
2010-12-13T23:17:50  <antimatroid> 6. Kill/Fuse (kill/fuse friend ants that land on the same square)
2010-12-13T23:17:50  <antimatroid> 6. Collision fights (fight enemy ants that are on the same square)
2010-12-13T23:17:51  <antimatroid> 7. Check win/draw/lose conditions

2010-12-13T23:17:57  <antimatroid> that's the order i think moves should be processed with my way
2010-12-13T23:18:12  <antimatroid> oh wait
2010-12-13T23:18:19  <antimatroid> i need to do spawning after moves
2010-12-13T23:23:57  <sigh> antimatroid: are you working off delt0r's impl?
2010-12-13T23:24:09  <antimatroid> sigh: no, i'm working on my one :P
2010-12-13T23:24:36  <antimatroid> Order of processing of moves:
2010-12-13T23:24:37  <antimatroid> 1. Attacks
2010-12-13T23:24:37  <antimatroid> 2. Harvests

2010-12-13T23:24:37  <Frontier> are yout two competing?
2010-12-13T23:24:38  <antimatroid> 7. Collision fights (fight opponent ants that are on the same square)
2010-12-13T23:24:38  <antimatroid> 8. Handle collisions for home bases again
2010-12-13T23:24:39  <antimatroid> 9. Check win/draw/lose conditions
2010-12-13T23:24:40  <sigh> sure, but is it a port of delt0r's or completly different?
2010-12-13T23:24:51  <antimatroid> can any of you think of any problem cases with that order of processing?
2010-12-13T23:24:57  <antimatroid> Frontier: just exploring both options
2010-12-13T23:25:09  <antimatroid> sigh: they're quite different games
2010-12-13T23:25:33  <antimatroid> oh, remove 8
2010-12-13T23:26:01  <sigh> what if there is no room to spawn?
2010-12-13T23:26:19  <antimatroid> an ant spawns on the home base if there are grains on it and no ant there
2010-12-13T23:26:26  <antimatroid> deplenishing grains as it goes
2010-12-13T23:26:47  <antimatroid> you can deposit grains from the adjacent square, and you have no walls/resources around your base
2010-12-13T23:27:54  <antimatroid> notice that it handles moves before spawning, and if you deposit a grain there when there is currently none, you will get a new ant the next turn
2010-12-13T23:28:16  <antimatroid> you can spawn an ant if they are on your base
2010-12-13T23:28:21  <antimatroid> just not for a friend ant
2010-12-13T23:28:39  <antimatroid> if we did friend ant fusion, then you could spawn no matter what, you just get mega ants
2010-12-13T23:29:31  <Frontier> instagib ants so to say
2010-12-13T23:30:02  <Frontier> and the visualizer would have to be in 3d ^^
2010-12-13T23:30:09  <antimatroid> ?
2010-12-13T23:30:11  <antimatroid> why?
2010-12-13T23:30:27  <Frontier> how would you visualize 10 ants in a stack
2010-12-13T23:30:45  <Frontier> oh wait... fusiin?!?
2010-12-13T23:30:54  <antimatroid> what's a site that'll let me post text? codepad seems to be down
2010-12-13T23:31:15  <antimatroid> Frontier: if you put two friend ants on top of each other, they become 1 ant with combined hp
2010-12-13T23:31:33  <Frontier> and combined grains i assume
2010-12-13T23:31:46  <antimatroid> yep, may have to drop some if they go above max carry capacity
2010-12-13T23:32:04  <antimatroid> or we could remove max carry capacity?
2010-12-13T23:32:09  <Zannick> antimatroid: pastebin
2010-12-13T23:32:16  <Frontier> ok, but then they cant deal the same amount of damage. I would always go for a lot of weak ants
2010-12-13T23:32:25  <Zannick> comes in .com, .org, .ca and many other flavors
2010-12-13T23:33:43  <Frontier> a max capacity is good i think. it adds to the gameplay.
2010-12-13T23:33:57  <antimatroid> Frontier: yes, i don't want friend ants to land on top of each other
2010-12-13T23:34:05  <antimatroid> it's that or kill both if they land on each other though
2010-12-13T23:34:12  <antimatroid> i don't like cancelling moves
2010-12-13T23:34:19  <antimatroid> sigh: http://pastebin.com/XQdSxiz3
2010-12-13T23:34:28  <Frontier> ok, then we could even turn the numbers in the visualizer into health bars
2010-12-13T23:34:37  <antimatroid> that's input/output format, start pack strategy and order of processing that i suggest currently
2010-12-13T23:35:01  <antimatroid> Frontier: does that work when hp can go above spawn amount?
2010-12-13T23:35:06  <Frontier> no
2010-12-13T23:35:10  <antimatroid> it would work if we killed them
2010-12-13T23:35:20  <antimatroid> i prefer killing them (like moving onto a wall)
2010-12-13T23:35:29  <antimatroid> it shouldn't be too hard to make sure you don't land on each other
