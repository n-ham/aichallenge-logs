2011-03-03T00:00:45  <jmcarthur> sigh: oh the thing on the haskell reddit?
2011-03-03T00:01:00  * antimatroid goes looking
2011-03-03T00:01:29  <sigh> jmcarthur: yeah... that's pretty much what I remember of my reddit browsing today
2011-03-03T00:01:34  <jmcarthur> i'm not really sure about that job...
2011-03-03T00:01:50  <sigh> I'm always suspicious when they don't give any details
2011-03-03T00:01:55  <sigh> upfront
2011-03-03T00:01:57  <jmcarthur> well i got details over the phone
2011-03-03T00:02:05  <jmcarthur> doesn't sound fishy or anything
2011-03-03T00:02:10  <jmcarthur> just not sure it's my cup of tea
2011-03-03T00:02:21  <antimatroid> link?
2011-03-03T00:02:26  <antimatroid> reddit is failing me
2011-03-03T00:02:33  <antimatroid> and you aren't using jmcarthur as your username
2011-03-03T00:02:37  <jmcarthur> i just get the impression that the guy doesn't really do the interviewing and hiring process very often
2011-03-03T00:02:38  <sigh> http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/fvwol/haskell_job_offer/
2011-03-03T00:02:53  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yeah it's an antiquated username of mine instead. geezusfreeek
2011-03-03T00:03:16  <sigh> jmcarthur: yeah, interviewing can be hard... I had to do it for the first time a couple weeks ago
2011-03-03T00:03:24  <sigh> still have no idea what I'm doing
2011-03-03T00:03:28  <jmcarthur> yeah and it's also weird that it was called a "job offer," but the guy isn't a native english speaker

2011-03-03T00:04:43  <sigh> what's wrong with new york?
2011-03-03T00:04:44  <antimatroid> ergh, queues
2011-03-03T00:04:55  <antimatroid> i'm averse to participating in queues
2011-03-03T00:04:59  <sigh> haha
2011-03-03T00:05:02  <jmcarthur> also talking to a company in portland. the work sounds less interesting, but the area much nicer
2011-03-03T00:05:13  <antimatroid> i would rather do something equivalent that takes longer but doesn't require me to wait in a queue
2011-03-03T00:05:23  <sigh> o_O
2011-03-03T00:05:34  <antimatroid> i've only ever seen good things about portland, anything bad was an attempt at keeping people away
2011-03-03T00:05:38  <antimatroid> seen/heard
2011-03-03T00:05:51  * antimatroid is an expert on the us :P
2011-03-03T00:05:55  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-03-03T00:06:42  <jmcarthur> i like pretty scenery and isolated living. hard to find in new york :P
2011-03-03T00:07:01  <jmcarthur> portland can offer that with a short commute to a city with the conveniences that come with it
2011-03-03T00:07:18  <antimatroid> i'm with you on that
2011-03-03T00:07:20  <sigh> :)
2011-03-03T00:07:29  <jmcarthur> i say "isolated" but i really just mean "not like sardines"
2011-03-03T00:07:48  <antimatroid> sigh's going away from that possibly :P
2011-03-03T00:08:00  <antimatroid> well, melbourne isn't quite, but sydneys worse
2011-03-03T00:08:08  <sigh> melbourne is nice and relaxed
2011-03-03T00:08:33  <antimatroid> i get money thanks to krudd next week
2011-03-03T00:08:40  <antimatroid> like $1050, and again next semester aha
2011-03-03T00:09:24  <sigh> why thanks to krudd?
2011-03-03T00:09:54  <antimatroid> payments to students he set up
2011-03-03T00:10:02  <antimatroid> got 650 or so each semester last year
2011-03-03T00:10:13  <antimatroid> part of that stimulus package
2011-03-03T00:10:17  <sigh> ah, i see
2011-03-03T00:10:18  <antimatroid> pretty stupid imo, but whatever
2011-03-03T00:10:27  <sigh> i want free monies :(
2011-03-03T00:10:49  <antimatroid> i worked for the first time in like 6 months yesterday :|
2011-03-03T00:10:51  <antimatroid> that was weird
2011-03-03T00:10:54  <sigh> yes, stimulate all the students to buy alcohol
2011-03-03T00:11:02  <sigh> what work?
2011-03-03T00:11:16  <antimatroid> same research stuff for an eco professor
2011-03-03T00:11:25  <antimatroid> i get to use c++ :D
2011-03-03T00:11:27  <antimatroid> i hate GAUSS
2011-03-03T00:11:29  <antimatroid> and matlab
2011-03-03T00:11:45  <antimatroid> we've finally talked her into letting us use c++ (the other half that was antimatroid)
2011-03-03T00:11:45  <sigh> ah, that sort of whork is pretty much like being in a class
2011-03-03T00:11:49  <sigh> *work
2011-03-03T00:12:05  <antimatroid> yeah, it's good experience, good pay and extremely felxible
2011-03-03T00:12:07  <sigh> antimatroid?
2011-03-03T00:12:07  <antimatroid> perfect students job
2011-03-03T00:12:24  <antimatroid> well i made the username before tron, but i worked with a friend for tron
2011-03-03T00:12:49  <antimatroid> he's the smarter version of me
2011-03-03T00:12:53  <sigh> oh, now I see what you are saying

2011-03-03T03:31:50  <antimatroid> chemuduguntar: sort of
2011-03-03T03:32:00  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-03T03:32:02  <antimatroid> there's a game spec
2011-03-03T03:32:20  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/bots there's some bots
2011-03-03T03:32:31  <antimatroid> i think the cpp is the most up to date one, feel free to ask me questions
2011-03-03T03:32:36  <chemuduguntar> antimatroid, cool
2011-03-03T03:32:45  <chemuduguntar> i am interested in making one for scheme
2011-03-03T03:36:27  <antimatroid> chemuduguntar: (your name is long) it's already been claimed to make the official one for scheme, but you're welcome to make your own
2011-03-03T03:36:50  <antimatroid> also note that the specs aren't finalised yet, but i'm fairly confident the io format for bots wont change anymore
2011-03-03T03:36:59  <antimatroid> at least nothing structurally signiciant, maybe a word or two
2011-03-03T03:37:04  <chemuduguntar> ah ok
2011-03-03T03:37:45  <chemuduguntar> is it any particular version of scheme?
2011-03-03T03:38:00  <chemuduguntar> i noticed that someone is making one for lisp on the wiki
2011-03-03T03:38:26  <antimatroid> there was a long conversation about that that i didn't really pay attention to
2011-03-03T03:38:41  <antimatroid> pyro-: what did you guys decide about scheme version?
2011-03-03T03:39:53  <antimatroid> amstan: do you know what was decided about scheme?
2011-03-03T03:40:04  <antimatroid> i assume since pyro has started ( i think) you guys decided something
2011-03-03T03:44:29  <pyro-> moin moin antimatroid
2011-03-03T03:44:50  <pyro-> i started making a scheme starter pack for mit-scheme 9.0.1
2011-03-03T03:45:02  <chemuduguntar> pyro-, cool
2011-03-03T03:45:15  <pyro-> i gave up trying to get an actualy answer
2011-03-03T03:45:34  <chemuduguntar> is it a matter of having the right scheme run time available on the server?
2011-03-03T03:45:37  <pyro-> but mcleoplod or however his name is has promised to "test it" or smt
2011-03-03T03:45:44  <pyro-> chemuduguntar: yep
2011-03-03T03:45:52  <pyro-> they wont give me a real answer as to that question
2011-03-03T03:46:00  <pyro-> but im hopefull someone will put mit-scheme for me
2011-03-03T03:46:41  <chemuduguntar> yea me too
2011-03-03T03:46:55  <pyro-> chemuduguntar: you might want to make your own starter anyway
2011-03-03T03:47:13  <pyro-> you might do a better job :p
2011-03-03T03:47:57  <antimatroid> it's good that you both want the same thing
2011-03-03T03:48:20  <antimatroid> pyro-: they're pretty good at accomodating, but they can't really promise you anything now when they can't check to see if it'll work and not screw newbies over
2011-03-03T03:49:03  <antimatroid> the fact that there is anything past java/c#/python should be celebrated imo :)
2011-03-03T03:49:25  <pyro-> how do you mean by screw newbies over?
2011-03-03T03:49:42  <pyro-> what* anyone would think im not a native english speaker :D
2011-03-03T03:50:03  <antimatroid> (i know nothing about scheme other than your conversations), if it was an implementation which was standardly used and newbies weren't expecting it to act the way it does, they might give up and just not participate
2011-03-03T03:50:08  <antimatroid> that would be bad for the competition
2011-03-03T03:50:21  <pyro-> ah
2011-03-03T03:50:21  <antimatroid> wasn't* :P
2011-03-03T03:50:30  <pyro-> that won't really happen at all no matter what you do
2011-03-03T03:50:55  <pyro-> there is no dominanant scheme implementation so we schemers just have to learn to adapt to whatever we've got at hand
2011-03-03T03:51:00  <pyro-> newbie or not
2011-03-03T03:51:08  <chemuduguntar> if we keep side effects to a minimum it will be good
2011-03-03T03:51:10  <antimatroid> why scheme then? just based off that it sounds awful?
2011-03-03T03:51:49  <pyro-> chemuduguntar i started by defining a bunch of adt with constructors and and selectors
2011-03-03T03:52:13  <pyro-> im not going to do anythign stupid with streams all over the place but its pretty functional :D
2011-03-03T03:52:54  <pyro-> antimatroid: the implementations and community are fragmented and yeah that is bad
2011-03-03T03:53:21  <pyro-> but i don't know any better programming language that has a working implementation in terms of its abstraction abilities
2011-03-03T03:53:47  <pyro-> if you ever wanted to learn scheme and how to program in scheme read the wizard book and acopaying lectures
2011-03-03T03:53:50  <pyro-> i cant spell that word
2011-03-03T03:54:09  <pyro-> accompanying
2011-03-03T03:54:43  <pyro-> antimatroid: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html famous computer science book that uses scheme :)
2011-03-03T03:55:07  <antimatroid> i've decided on haskell for my next language, i'm (very) slowly learning it
2011-03-03T03:55:19  <pyro-> http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/ video lectures to go with
2011-03-03T03:55:19  <antimatroid> c++ does pretty much everything i need, except templates are awful
2011-03-03T03:55:29  <antimatroid> if it wasn't for c++ templates i wouldn't be looking to change
2011-03-03T03:56:54  <pyro-> c++ = every feature Stroustrup ever heard of hacked on top of C, badly :)
2011-03-03T03:56:59  <pyro-> but its usefull sometimes
2011-03-03T03:57:44  <pyro-> i dont know haskel either. i find haskel, ml and friends very hard to learn for some reason
2011-03-03T03:57:48  <pyro-> +l

2011-03-03T03:59:33  <chemuduguntar> haskell wasn't made for mere mortals =)
2011-03-03T03:59:46  <chemuduguntar> haskell is like there is no spoon
2011-03-03T04:00:41  <pyro-> there was no spoon for me when the wizard book showed me how a mostly working version of cons can be defined in terms of lambda :D
2011-03-03T04:01:34  <chemuduguntar> oh yea that blew my mind the first time i saw it
2011-03-03T04:01:47  <chemuduguntar> i started seeing lambda symbols everywhere
2011-03-03T04:02:23  <pyro-> dreaming in lambda calculus = bad trip. do not recomend
2011-03-03T04:05:51  <chemuduguntar> grokking over cpp bot e.g. now to get an idea of the main loop
2011-03-03T04:07:48  <pyro-> chemuduguntar: will you make and publish a scheme starter pack? i will snarf your good ideas
2011-03-03T04:08:44  <chemuduguntar> pyro-, sure
2011-03-03T04:08:55  <chemuduguntar> you might be correcting my horrible mess of a code though :)
2011-03-03T04:09:22  <pyro-> in any case it will be usefull to have someone to compare notes with
2011-03-03T04:09:28  <antimatroid> pyro-: sure about c++, but it lets me do almost anything i want, which i like
2011-03-03T04:09:34  <pyro-> not that i have a huge amount of time for this competition atm
2011-03-03T04:10:06  <pyro-> yep antimatroid ! the benefit of collecting a huge ugly mass of features together is there's normally the feature your looking for somewhere
2011-03-03T04:10:47  <pyro-> scheme does not have the quality of libraries and runtimes for me to use it for application programming

2011-03-03T04:11:22  <antimatroid> ahaha
2011-03-03T04:11:54  <antimatroid> i had to write my own process class for c++
2011-03-03T04:11:56  <antimatroid> was not impressed
2011-03-03T04:12:04  <antimatroid> well, i mostly got someone else to
2011-03-03T04:12:22  <antimatroid> i can use it like a stream now though :)
2011-03-03T04:12:26  <pyro-> :D
2011-03-03T04:12:39  <pyro-> i don't know much about pure mathematics :D
2011-03-03T04:12:54  <pyro-> i only need some logic stuff for computer science and some applied stuff for engineering :D
2011-03-03T04:14:27  <pyro-> antimatroid what is a process class?
2011-03-03T04:14:39  <pyro-> for representing operating system processes?
2011-03-03T04:15:17  <antimatroid> no, for running bots in an engine
2011-03-03T04:15:29  <antimatroid> i'm doing game theory stuff for my thesis and need it

2011-03-03T04:44:18  <chemuduguntar> so ants can spawn and fight over water
2011-03-03T04:44:23  <chemuduguntar> seems a bit counter-intuitive
2011-03-03T04:44:39  <chemuduguntar> but i am guessing that only way they can spawn is an ant is close to the shore
2011-03-03T04:44:48  <antimatroid1> chemuduguntar: the spawn especially, but that's how it's been made
2011-03-03T04:45:18  <antimatroid1> i have suggested a few times it might be better to change that, but oh well
2011-03-03T04:45:19  <antimatroid1> it doesn't really matter
2011-03-03T04:45:25  <pyro-> i stopped trying to think of the ants as ants
2011-03-03T04:45:45  <antimatroid1> what do you two think about the two battle options?
2011-03-03T04:45:48  <pyro-> random pixels with random rules =D
2011-03-03T04:46:39  <antimatroid1> battle option 1 looks a big confusing at first, but once you understand it, it's really quite straight forward
2011-03-03T04:46:39  <pyro-> me? i did'nt bother spending much time to compare them. if i were designing a game i would try and simplify it so such choices didn't have to be made
2011-03-03T04:46:58  <antimatroid1> the two options naturally present themselves
2011-03-03T04:47:12  <antimatroid1> they are deterministic which is important
2011-03-03T04:47:51  <antimatroid1> battle option 2 can't always be correctly calculated by the actual bot with fog of war, is slower to calculate, and offers less interesting micro
2011-03-03T04:48:12  <antimatroid1> the only real argument for it is that "newb bots" wont get beaten as badly by the very top bots
2011-03-03T04:48:21  <pyro-> i would not have pixels attacking with range. maybe attack by collision or attack by attack command
2011-03-03T04:48:32  <chemuduguntar> "Each bot is passed a parameter at the start of the game indicating the square of each ants visibility, which is how far each ant can see around them. At the moment this is set at 96, giving a view radius of approximately 9.8." how were 96 and 9.8 derived?
2011-03-03T04:49:03  <pyro-> your two battle options arnt interesting to me from a game design perspective so i dont really look much at either :D
2011-03-03T04:51:04  <pyro-> sorry :D
2011-03-03T04:51:24  <pyro-> your number 1 seems less random but i only gave them both a cursery glance
2011-03-03T04:52:44  <antimatroid1> chemuduguntar: it makes a nice circle :)
2011-03-03T04:53:07  <antimatroid1> pixels attacking with range?
2011-03-03T04:53:15  <antimatroid1> attack by collision is boring
2011-03-03T04:53:26  <chemuduguntar> antimatroid1, i see
2011-03-03T04:53:27  <antimatroid1> i made a game that had actual fight moves
2011-03-03T04:53:56  <chemuduguntar> hmm is there a transform that'll go from radius to n-pixels?
2011-03-03T04:54:08  <antimatroid1> and you had home holes that could be invaded to win the game, and you had to take harvest back home to spawn new ants
2011-03-03T04:54:11  <antimatroid1> but it was "too complicated"
2011-03-03T04:54:21  <pyro-> antimatroid1: you showed me it
2011-03-03T04:54:24  <antimatroid1> transform? what do you mean?
2011-03-03T04:54:43  <pyro-> i think your boring is not my boring :)
2011-03-03T04:54:44  <chemuduguntar> like if you had a radius of r, how many pixels would be visible?
2011-03-03T04:55:02  <antimatroid1> not sure, i suspect you could work it out, but it'd be a bit messy
2011-03-03T04:55:22  <antimatroid1> given calculations are done with euclidean distance modified for the fact that you're playing on a donut
2011-03-03T04:55:27  <pyro-> chemuduguntar: you should can use the distance formula on the specification page
2011-03-03T04:55:56  <antimatroid1> i would also look at the getLocation function in state.cc of my starter bot on the git page
2011-03-03T04:56:47  <antimatroid1> although you don't need to translate it before modding if the language does -1%5 = 4
2011-03-03T04:56:55  <pyro-> antimatroid1 you study game theory
2011-03-03T04:57:16  <antimatroid1> pyro-: i'm doing my honours thesis this year on game theory, it's one of my main interests yes :P
2011-03-03T04:57:31  <pyro-> i find games that are closer to game theory games more interesting
2011-03-03T04:57:43  <antimatroid1> so do i, but alas apparently the masses do not
2011-03-03T04:57:51  <pyro-> its only boring in terms of it has no story line
2011-03-03T04:57:56  <pyro-> the game itself is far more interesting
2011-03-03T04:58:03  <antimatroid1> but there is some interesting stuff moving to n-players with non-optimal bots
2011-03-03T04:58:18  <pyro-> also having f.o.w. is horrible
2011-03-03T04:58:31  <antimatroid1> and i have heaps of ideas for my bot with this, i think it will be a good ai contest game
2011-03-03T04:58:42  <antimatroid1> fow is good
2011-03-03T04:59:02  <antimatroid1> and also allows for larger maps (information to be passed)
2011-03-03T04:59:30  <pyro-> but its definitly horrible ;D
2011-03-03T04:59:59  <antimatroid1> we've come too far with enough agreement to change much now
2011-03-03T05:01:16  <pyro-> iirc it will be the first game without perfect information
2011-03-03T05:01:27  <chemuduguntar> dynamic game rules ? ... that'd make it interesting ;)
2011-03-03T05:01:38  <chemuduguntar> or a surprise fudge factor
2011-03-03T05:01:47  <pyro-> XD
2011-03-03T05:01:54  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-03-03T05:01:56  <chemuduguntar> like topographical overlay
2011-03-03T05:01:59  <antimatroid1> first nplayer game too
2011-03-03T05:02:39  <pyro-> nplayer is interesting !
2011-03-03T05:02:40  <antimatroid1> i think it will be better in planet wars in that there's more room for clear improvements
2011-03-03T05:02:44  <antimatroid1> than*
2011-03-03T05:03:06  <antimatroid1> there was a huge brick wall for planet wars, where it was very hard to make any noticeable improvements
2011-03-03T05:03:17  <antimatroid1> it was an awesome game though
2011-03-03T05:03:22  <pyro-> n players is one thing i like more about your new game
2011-03-03T05:03:35  <pyro-> did anyone maked a map generator yet?
2011-03-03T05:03:38  <antimatroid1> i was very hesitant about going to n players
2011-03-03T05:03:48  <antimatroid1> mcleopold and i have made one, but neither are good
2011-03-03T05:03:59  <antimatroid1> it's an open problem that everyone is encouraged to play around with
2011-03-03T05:04:20  <antimatroid1> we don't want crappy random noisy maps
2011-03-03T05:04:29  <antimatroid1> we want random, interesting, cool looking maps
2011-03-03T05:05:04  <pyro-> i got as far as working out what i think is all the possible ways a map can be fair. but no progress on how to make them 'nice'
2011-03-03T05:05:06  <antimatroid1> if we can get reasonably fair non-symmetric maps, unfortunately i think they will be used, but i'm going to try to make non-boring lattice symmetric ones
2011-03-03T05:05:28  <chemuduguntar> my first poke at it would be creating puddles that are rougly circular
2011-03-03T05:05:36  <antimatroid1> here is an interesting example where all players start in a different row and col
2011-03-03T05:06:31  <antimatroid1> err, nevermind
2011-03-03T05:06:35  <antimatroid1> it's a very silly example
2011-03-03T05:06:38  <pyro-> :(
2011-03-03T05:07:00  <antimatroid1> it's no different to just placing players down the diagonal, except it's translated
2011-03-03T05:07:08  <chemuduguntar> i think the real interesting maps will be those that have geographical features like narrows passes between territories etc.
2011-03-03T05:07:24  <antimatroid1> exactly
2011-03-03T05:07:29  <pyro-> aww man i wish i had more time
2011-03-03T05:07:34  <antimatroid1> i tried playing around with perlin noise, but i didn't get very interesting results
2011-03-03T05:08:04  <antimatroid1> pryo-: the learning persons biggest constraint, time
2011-03-03T05:08:13  <pyro-> i don't like your new game much. but generating maps for it is a very interesting problem!
2011-03-03T05:08:19  <pyro-> :D
2011-03-03T05:08:20  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-03-03T05:08:46  <antimatroid1> think about battle option 1, you want to get more ants closer to theirs to kill them without losing anything, it's very strategic
2011-03-03T05:08:51  <antimatroid1> i think it makes for an awesome game
2011-03-03T05:09:24  <pyro-> game is too complecated for my taste. not that i can formally define complecated
2011-03-03T05:09:28  <antimatroid1> pretty obvious what kind of strategy will do best though
2011-03-03T05:09:54  <antimatroid1> i got my thesis idea from this game actually, but it's too messy to actually do my idea with
2011-03-03T05:10:13  <antimatroid1> i'm setting up engines for more general games, then playing around with stuff through there
2011-03-03T05:10:17  *** JackyAlcine <JackyAlcine!~JackyAlci@unaffiliated/webjadmin> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-03-03T05:10:40  <antimatroid1> i also get to play around with game generation there, and trying to partition classes of games into equivalence classes based on structure
2011-03-03T05:11:03  <antimatroid1> <3 maths
2011-03-03T05:11:11  <pyro-> can has translated diagonal map?
2011-03-03T05:11:47  <pyro-> i want to see if it escapes my notion of how to produce fair maps
2011-03-03T05:14:03  <antimatroid1> actually, it wasn't such a transpose
2011-03-03T05:14:04  <antimatroid1> ...e.
2011-03-03T05:14:05  <antimatroid1> .d...
2011-03-03T05:14:05  <antimatroid1> ....c
2011-03-03T05:14:05  <antimatroid1> ..b..
2011-03-03T05:14:05  <antimatroid1> a....
2011-03-03T05:14:32  <antimatroid1> the idea is find a location for a, pick rt, ct, then you you that translated n times to be the same position again
2011-03-03T05:14:49  <antimatroid1> transpose == translation
2011-03-03T05:14:52  <pyro-> i see it
2011-03-03T05:15:32  <antimatroid1> i think i can generate those by starting with an nxn grid with them along the diagonals, then transposing and stretching it
2011-03-03T05:15:55  <antimatroid1> then you have your rc and rt to symmetrically place any water squares with
2011-03-03T05:16:06  <antimatroid1> and you just palce n wall squares using rc and rt
2011-03-03T05:16:33  <antimatroid1> actually, that doesn't make that one does it, hmmm, it's an annoying tricky little problem
2011-03-03T05:16:51  <pyro-> i consider only 1x1, 2x2 or 4x4 tiles
2011-03-03T05:16:58  <pyro-> and then tile them
2011-03-03T05:17:34  <pyro-> and each group of tiles must be symetric in one of translation or rotation
2011-03-03T05:17:53  <pyro-> i think its enough considerations to generate all perfectly fair maps
2011-03-03T05:18:25  <antimatroid1> the other open problem is generating almost fair asymmetric maps
2011-03-03T05:18:27  <pyro-> 1x1 tile = tile with one ant not one grid cell
2011-03-03T05:19:23  <chemuduguntar> if i am understanding this correctly
2011-03-03T05:19:48  <pyro-> i ignored that one :) all my shitty maps met the fairness condition that starting from any ant the description of the map relative to that ant is identical to the description starting at any other ant origin
2011-03-03T05:20:14  <chemuduguntar> an ant (a) dies if any of it's enemies have more enemies than num_enemies(a)
2011-03-03T05:20:23  <chemuduguntar> ?
2011-03-03T05:27:42  <chemuduguntar> i sort of makes sense
2011-03-03T05:27:54  <chemuduguntar> assuming my reasoning is correct
2011-03-03T05:27:56  <pyro-> sort of yeah ;)
2011-03-03T05:28:14  <pyro-> its not a very simple mechanism
2011-03-03T05:29:19  <chemuduguntar> two ants will kill each other
2011-03-03T05:30:20  <chemuduguntar> 1a vs 2b ( a sees two enemies, each enemy in turn has one enemy - so a will die)
2011-03-03T05:31:05  <chemuduguntar> 2b.0 will see 1 enemy , that one enemy  (a) has two enemies (2b.0 and 2b.1)
2011-03-03T05:31:21  <chemuduguntar> so both 2b.0 and 2b.1 survive
2011-03-03T05:35:14  <chemuduguntar> i can imagine this calculation will take some time
2011-03-03T05:35:26  <chemuduguntar> so the visible area must be limited
2011-03-03T05:37:31  <pyro-> "attackradius2 6" antimatroid1 the same range is used for attacking enemy ants as is used for judging wether or not an ant is supporting its friend?
2011-03-03T05:37:58  <antimatroid1> pyro-: you don't "support your friend"
2011-03-03T05:38:36  <antimatroid1> chemuduguntar: that is correct for battle option 1
2011-03-03T05:38:57  <antimatroid1> unfortunately the engine is currently implementing option 2, but it's all set up for both
2011-03-03T05:40:26  <pyro-> antimatroid1: you do, in option 1. by providing your enemies with more enemies such that you no longer have at least as many enemies in range as any of your enemies have in range
2011-03-03T05:41:29  <pyro-> maybe you prefer my question if i say, the same range is used to see what enemies your enemies have in range as to decide that aforementioned enemy is in range of yourself
2011-03-03T05:41:37  <antimatroid1> pyro-: yes, but not explicitly
2011-03-03T05:41:49  <antimatroid1> the number of friends in range of your ant is irrelevant in deciding whether it dies
2011-03-03T05:42:01  <antimatroid1> implicitly you help them by getting closer to the enemies
2011-03-03T05:42:36  <pyro-> but the number of friends in range of your enemy is not. i will say that those friends are supporting each other
2011-03-03T05:43:30  <antimatroid1> "the same range is used for attacking enemy ants as is used for judging wether or not an ant is supporting its friend?"
2011-03-03T05:43:30  <antimatroid1> what do you mean by "an ant is supporting its friend?"?
2011-03-03T05:43:38  <antimatroid1> you never count up how many friends are near an ant
2011-03-03T05:44:03  <pyro-> i think in any case the answer must be in the affirmative
2011-03-03T05:44:35  <chemuduguntar> hmm can rule 1 be condensed to the following:
2011-03-03T05:44:43  <antimatroid1> consider a..b vs a..a..b
2011-03-03T05:44:46  <chemuduguntar> the group with the lowest number of enemies survives
2011-03-03T05:44:50  <antimatroid1> in both cases 1 a and 1 b die
2011-03-03T05:45:10  <antimatroid1> chemuduguntar: not sure, i don't think so
2011-03-03T05:45:15  <pyro-> chemuduguntar: but some parts of a group may not be in range of the same enemies as others
2011-03-03T05:45:24  <antimatroid1> oh, for any ants in range, sure, but it's a bit messy
2011-03-03T05:45:45  <chemuduguntar> oh, assuming we are considering only the ants within a given range yes
2011-03-03T05:45:46  <pyro-> its messy in any case =D
2011-03-03T05:46:13  <antimatroid1> it's pretty easy to do battle option 1 and makes for cool strategies
2011-03-03T05:46:46  <antimatroid1> and it also provides balance to the already existent incentive to spread your ants out for "first acceissible" rights and visibility
2011-03-03T05:46:58  <antimatroid1> whereas option 2 also encourages spreading your ants
2011-03-03T05:46:59  <pyro-> i dislike thinking about it. if i make an entry i intend to teach the computer the rule and let it brute force search for good situations
2011-03-03T05:47:02  <antimatroid1> same as colliding
2011-03-03T05:47:11  <antimatroid1> you can do that
2011-03-03T05:47:22  <antimatroid1> i intend to use a game tree for ants close to fighting
2011-03-03T05:47:36  <pyro-> -that's the same thing
2011-03-03T05:47:49  <pyro-> search the game tree* :)
2011-03-03T05:48:20  <antimatroid1> my bot for planet wars used a game tree, but it was so messy it was awful
2011-03-03T05:48:37  <chemuduguntar> one strategy that comes to my mind with the first case ... is you could 'tip' the equation against a player
2011-03-03T05:48:45  <chemuduguntar> if you had player a b c
2011-03-03T05:48:47  <chemuduguntar> you were c
2011-03-03T05:49:03  <antimatroid1> chemuduguntar: yes, it also allows for cooperation better
2011-03-03T05:49:04  <chemuduguntar> you could sacrifice a few of your ants, so either a or b will win
2011-03-03T05:49:19  <antimatroid1> and tit for tat strategies with cooperating with a particular player etc.
2011-03-03T05:49:22  <pyro-> depends how scoring is
2011-03-03T05:49:47  <pyro-> whether i want to remove b or let him trouble a
2011-03-03T05:50:07  <antimatroid1> each ant is worth 1 point, when it dies, any ants in range get an equal proportion of those points (an ant in range can be alive or dying from battle as well) which are then passed onto that bots owners
2011-03-03T05:50:26  <antimatroid1> so aa.b.c would give 2/3 points to a and 1/3 points to c
2011-03-03T05:50:54  <pyro-> ah
2011-03-03T05:51:32  <pyro-> in that case i probably want to be a fair bit agressive
2011-03-03T05:51:46  <antimatroid1> there is a food bonus at the end too, basically any live bots (one if there is a winner, possibly multiple if end of turns) at the end get points for the number of food squares left and the number of food squares that would have spawned if the game continued to the end
2011-03-03T05:52:03  <antimatroid1> option 2 you never want to have more than 1 ant at an equal distance to an enemy
2011-03-03T05:52:17  <antimatroid1> it's basically, spread out and don't get caught together
2011-03-03T05:52:44  <pyro-> which happens to also be what you want to do to cover a large food spawning area
2011-03-03T05:52:52  <chemuduguntar> antimatroid1, aa.b.c , wouldn't the only surviving ants there be 'aa' ?
2011-03-03T05:52:58  <antimatroid1> no
2011-03-03T05:53:05  <antimatroid1> b has 4 enemies, c 1
2011-03-03T05:53:10  <antimatroid1> b dies
2011-03-03T05:53:18  <pyro-> b can't have 4 enemies
2011-03-03T05:53:24  <antimatroid1> 3**
2011-03-03T05:53:26  * chemuduguntar confused :)
2011-03-03T05:53:27  <pyro-> unless he dislikes himself very much indeed
2011-03-03T05:53:47  <chemuduguntar> oh i see
2011-03-03T05:53:56  <chemuduguntar> so c can't see 'aa'
2011-03-03T05:54:05  <antimatroid1> so with a.b.c, only b dies, but if c or a didn't cooperate, the other two would die
2011-03-03T05:54:13  <antimatroid1> but you could cooperate with people based on their past actions
2011-03-03T05:54:24  <pyro-> why does c not see the right most a?
2011-03-03T05:54:26  <antimatroid1> c can see aa as it's within view, it's not within the attack radius
2011-03-03T05:54:38  <pyro-> why does c not attack-see the right most a?
2011-03-03T05:54:45  <antimatroid1> too far away to attack
2011-03-03T05:54:50  <chemuduguntar> right...
2011-03-03T05:55:09  <antimatroid1> it would be pretty boring if you didn't see an enemy until you engaged in battle
2011-03-03T05:55:11  <pyro-> why does b attack-see the leftmost a then?
2011-03-03T05:55:19  <antimatroid1> because it's within the attack radius
2011-03-03T05:55:33  <pyro-> what is .?
2011-03-03T05:55:36  <antimatroid1> land
2011-03-03T05:55:43  <pyro-> okay. that is clear
2011-03-03T05:56:08  <antimatroid1> * = food, % = water, a-z = live ant, . = land, ? = (unofficial now) unseeable
2011-03-03T05:56:27  <antimatroid1> only unofficial because none of the official io requires passing anything about unknown squares
2011-03-03T05:56:58  <pyro-> the more i think about it
2011-03-03T05:57:07  <antimatroid1> the more awesome it is :P
2011-03-03T05:57:11  <antimatroid1> everyone has that
2011-03-03T05:57:23  <pyro-> the more i think i'll write a starter thingy and a map generator and not an entry
2011-03-03T05:57:32  <antimatroid1> bleh :P
2011-03-03T05:57:48  <chemuduguntar> "<antimatroid1> so aa.b.c would give 2/3 points to a and 1/3 points to c"
2011-03-03T05:58:03  <chemuduguntar> why not 1/2 and 1/2
2011-03-03T05:58:19  <antimatroid1> chemuduguntar: because a had 2 ants involved in killing b
2011-03-03T05:58:28  <antimatroid1> they did twice as much work
2011-03-03T05:58:59  <chemuduguntar> ah right ... so attack radius here is 3
2011-03-03T05:59:12  <antimatroid1> oh yeah, my bad :P
2011-03-03T05:59:27  <pyro-> antimatroid1: the amount of time you are taking to explain it to us two, you'll have to take that long with all the other 3000 competitors who sign up too =D
2011-03-03T05:59:44  <antimatroid1> there will be some better explanations once it's decided
2011-03-03T05:59:47  <antimatroid1> with clear diagrams
2011-03-03T06:00:01  <antimatroid1> i should just go ahead and make them
2011-03-03T06:00:13  <pyro-> use prose :)
2011-03-03T06:00:34  <antimatroid1> i'm terrible at coherent english, i just aim for it being unambiguous
2011-03-03T06:00:38  <antimatroid1> i fail at that too
2011-03-03T06:01:10  <chemuduguntar> it almost feels like a game of carcassone
2011-03-03T06:02:39  <chemuduguntar> it's been a while since i played it though
2011-03-03T06:02:42  <antimatroid1> battle option 1 also feels a bit like multiplayer game of life to me
2011-03-03T06:02:54  <chemuduguntar> then again it is late as
2011-03-03T06:02:55  <antimatroid1> which is awesome, not buts!
2011-03-03T06:03:08  <antimatroid1> no buts*
2011-03-03T06:03:27  <chemuduguntar> i can see the game of life connection
2011-03-03T06:03:42  <chemuduguntar> and celluar automata :)
2011-03-03T06:03:57  <antimatroid1> we actually worked out how to do multiplayer game of life, but decided it was too complicated and would just present a huge brick wall again
2011-03-03T06:04:20  <antimatroid1> you also had the nice fact that since squares needed 3 neighbours for a birth (i think we were 2 player at the time), you had no draws
2011-03-03T06:04:55  <antimatroid1> i think tron on a graph where edges were coloured instead of nodes would make for an awesome game too
2011-03-03T06:05:16  * pyro- o0 (more complecated than the current game :O)
2011-03-03T06:05:23  <antimatroid1> it offered less room for improving ones strategy
2011-03-03T06:05:40  <antimatroid1> and "one player" game of life is "too well studied" apparently
2011-03-03T06:07:17  <chemuduguntar> i am off 2 bed ... hope to continue this conversation later :)
2011-03-03T06:07:20  <chemuduguntar> nite all

2011-03-03T06:09:01  <pyro-> for the purposes of being able to talk to me here i will be asleep
2011-03-03T06:09:25  <antimatroid1> night then :P

2011-03-03T10:36:06  <antimatroid> currently working out how to make it more sane
2011-03-03T10:36:17  <antimatroid> and have both rows and columns loop before getting back to the start
2011-03-03T10:37:42  <Frontier> hey nice. i wonder how that looks with walls ! and there are larger primes below 26 :)
2011-03-03T10:38:21  <antimatroid> what do you mean larger primes below 26?
2011-03-03T10:38:37  <antimatroid> i want to work out how to generalise it more before i add walls in
2011-03-03T10:38:47  <antimatroid> turns out group theory is practicle
2011-03-03T10:38:57  <Frontier> You could have made even longer maps
2011-03-03T10:39:24  <antimatroid> i'm not sure i follow?
2011-03-03T10:39:50  <antimatroid> oh, i have prime numbers of players
2011-03-03T10:39:56  <antimatroid> i wonder if that's enforced
2011-03-03T10:40:22  <antimatroid> nope
2011-03-03T10:40:30  <antimatroid> it just spat out one with 15 players
2011-03-03T10:40:33  <Frontier> 13 players was an experiment, wasn't it? and i looked for something even more unpractical like telling the map gen to generate a map for 23 players
2011-03-03T10:40:59  <antimatroid> atm it's picking the players based on how long it'll take to cycle through given it has been picked to be possible
2011-03-03T10:41:06  <antimatroid> i'm working on changing that
2011-03-03T10:41:45  <antimatroid> obviously i want to change that around
2011-03-03T10:45:35  <antimatroid> i think i want lcm(order(rtranslate), order(ctranslate)) = noPlayers
2011-03-03T10:45:49  <antimatroid> but order(rt) = rows/gcd(rt, rows)
2011-03-03T10:45:58  <antimatroid> i need to sort this mess out
2011-03-03T10:46:25  <Frontier> what is lcm?
2011-03-03T10:46:29  <antimatroid> thank god for lcm(a,b) = |ab|/gcd(a,b)
2011-03-03T10:46:33  <antimatroid> lowest common multiple

2011-03-03T11:58:19  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: looks like it never find an 8 player map with that
2011-03-03T11:58:20  <McLeopold> too much wall
2011-03-03T11:58:23  <jmcarthur> *finds
2011-03-03T11:58:30  <McLeopold> I'll solve that after the contest starts
2011-03-03T11:58:32  <jmcarthur> with those parameters
2011-03-03T11:58:44  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: try some larger dimensions?
2011-03-03T11:59:14  <jmcarthur> doing that now
2011-03-03T11:59:14  <McLeopold> what are you solving for?
2011-03-03T11:59:24  <antimatroid> the number of possible starting positions
2011-03-03T11:59:36  <antimatroid> less water
2011-03-03T11:59:55  <jmcarthur> with dimensions between 25 and 50 and number of players from 4 to 12, it finds 419 combinations
2011-03-03T12:00:12  <antimatroid> i think dimensions are going to be way larger anyway
2011-03-03T12:00:15  <antimatroid> if we can
2011-03-03T12:00:34  <antimatroid> and if we fix up sequential move making, we can do more players alright
2011-03-03T12:00:49  <jmcarthur> err, i mean players between 2 and 12

2011-03-03T12:01:02  <jmcarthur> it found player counts for the entire range between 3 and 12
2011-03-03T12:01:03  <McLeopold> if you have a 10x10 with 2, is (0,0),(5,5) the same as (1,1),(6,6)?
2011-03-03T12:01:09  <antimatroid> i think minPlayers should be at least 3
2011-03-03T12:01:16  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yes
2011-03-03T12:01:23  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I would prefer min at 2
2011-03-03T12:01:27  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: so does your formula ;)
2011-03-03T12:01:39  <antimatroid> jmcarthur?
2011-03-03T12:01:58  <antimatroid> McLeopold: why? 3+ players is a significantly different game to 2 player
2011-03-03T12:02:06  <antimatroid> although it could be interesting to see the differences
2011-03-03T12:02:09  <McLeopold> I know, that's why
2011-03-03T12:02:22  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-03-03T12:02:39  <McLeopold> in playing galcon online, the game goes chaotic the moment there are only 2
2011-03-03T12:02:44  <antimatroid> i think we should go for mcleopold looking symmetric maps to start with
2011-03-03T12:03:02  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it only found valid 2 player games when i crank the ranges way up
2011-03-03T12:03:04  <antimatroid> and test some asymmetric ones too, but not for releasing
2011-03-03T12:03:07  <McLeopold> my maps were not symmettric
2011-03-03T12:03:13  <jmcarthur> [players | rows <- [25..100], cols <- [25..100], ctrans <- [2..20], rtrans <- [2..20], players <- [lcm (rows `div` gcd rtrans rows) (cols `div` gcd ctrans cols)], players >= 2 && players <= 16]
2011-03-03T12:03:17  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: that shouldn't be hard with 2 people? :\
2011-03-03T12:03:22  <jmcarthur> 14038 combinations ^^

2011-03-03T12:03:55  <jmcarthur> looks good to me
2011-03-03T12:04:13  <antimatroid> i think it's easy to make sure players start at least x away from each other without water
2011-03-03T12:04:18  <McLeopold> so, is this for creating 1 map, then having the engine pick the starting locations?
2011-03-03T12:04:21  <antimatroid> it's too costly to calculate that after adding water
2011-03-03T12:04:55  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: of those 14038 combinations, only 64 are two players

2011-03-03T12:06:31  <jmcarthur> fun to see the prime numbers decrease like that
2011-03-03T12:07:02  <jmcarthur> and 16...
2011-03-03T12:07:17  <jmcarthur> i guess that might be attributable to being at the max end of the range

2011-03-03T12:16:02  <jmcarthur> heheh
2011-03-03T12:17:38  <antimatroid1> i think it will be reasonable hard to do mcleopold style maps symmetrically
2011-03-03T12:17:54  <antimatroid1> without having a whole bunch of wall squares anyway
2011-03-03T12:18:20  <jmcarthur> i still don't know how much a care about symmetry. i think it will balance out, especially if we prune maps
2011-03-03T12:18:26  <jmcarthur> *how much i care
2011-03-03T12:18:53  <jmcarthur> i think "near" symmetry is good enough
2011-03-03T12:19:19  <jmcarthur> complete asymmetry is probably bad i guess
2011-03-03T12:19:36  <jmcarthur> but a uniform enough map generator should be quite fair, usually

2011-03-03T12:22:34  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: anyway, i think a reasonable conclusion to draw from my experiments is that your loop isn't all that slow
2011-03-03T12:22:44  <jmcarthur> or probably isn't
2011-03-03T12:23:02  <jmcarthur> i was able to compute those in ghci really fast, and ghci is slow

2011-03-03T12:41:57  <jmcarthur> an action that takes an ant position and returns the directions it can move without hitting water
2011-03-03T12:42:05  <antimatroid1> ah okay
2011-03-03T12:42:25  <jmcarthur> on the other hand, i've added a little magic as well, but it's not cheating at least

2011-03-03T14:51:06  <amstan> i like it.. it's .lol
2011-03-03T14:51:07  <amstan> lol
2011-03-03T14:53:04  <McLeopold> This implementation doesn't support any string function.  So I can't actually parse the input stream.
2011-03-03T14:53:55  <McLeopold> We'd have to go with a "non-standard compliant" implementation lolz
2011-03-03T14:53:59  <Zannick> do we have lolcode support added to the compilers?
2011-03-03T14:54:06  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-03-03T14:54:36  <McLeopold> If we do, we ought to go with mailchimp's, but I haven't got it installed yet.

2011-03-03T15:08:46  <janzert> McLeopold: I don't believe so
2011-03-03T15:08:47  <amstan> McLeopold: nope, it was just an experiment
2011-03-03T15:08:54  <amstan> McLeopold: grep the php if they use it
2011-03-03T15:08:56  <amstan> but probably not
2011-03-03T15:08:59  <McLeopold> I'm dropping it.
2011-03-03T15:09:10  <amstan> McLeopold: remember to update the schema
2011-03-03T15:09:31  <McLeopold> I'm creating a whole new schema
2011-03-03T15:09:35  <amstan> ok
2011-03-03T15:09:36  <janzert> A good going over of the indexes used would be really good
2011-03-03T15:09:48  <janzert> ahh, starting from scratch is good too
2011-03-03T15:11:07  <McLeopold> also, I don't think replays should be in the database
2011-03-03T15:12:10  <McLeopold> for the ranking table, was wins, losses and draws every used?
2011-03-03T15:15:47  <amstan> McLeopold: try grepping the code
2011-03-03T15:17:32  <McLeopold> grep amstan ranking.draws
2011-03-03T15:17:54  <amstan> McLeopold: hmm?
2011-03-03T15:18:06  <janzert> moving replays out of the database would certainly be an improvement
2011-03-03T15:18:42  <janzert> McLeopold: I'm not positive about the win-loss-draw but I don't think so
2011-03-03T15:19:21  <janzert> check process_ratings.py to see if they're even recorded
2011-03-03T15:19:39  <janzert> and no they aren't
2011-03-03T15:19:52  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-03T15:19:54  <janzert> they were always recorded as 0
2011-03-03T15:20:14  <amstan> they used to be used in the days before elo

2011-03-03T16:38:01  <lavalamp> cool, is there an example command line anywhere?
2011-03-03T16:38:04  <jmcarthur> lavalamp: it's still in a lot of flux, but useful enough for testing against

2011-03-03T18:36:58  <McLeopold> any members?
2011-03-03T18:37:01  <amstan> probably..
2011-03-03T18:37:05  <Zannick> i seem to remember this
2011-03-03T18:37:10  <Zannick> is one of them the "Other" org?
2011-03-03T18:37:15  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-03T18:37:15  <amstan> Zannick: no
2011-03-03T18:37:19  <Zannick> huh
2011-03-03T18:37:32  <amstan> Zannick: though, yes.. we did have 2 others at one time. with different ids though
2011-03-03T18:37:48  <amstan> McLeopold: the ids of the organizations should be unique
2011-03-03T18:37:49  <Zannick> ah, i might be thinking of that
2011-03-03T18:37:54  <amstan> same with the ids of the other tables

2011-03-03T18:39:58  <McLeopold> I mean the website didn't crash
2011-03-03T18:40:18  <McLeopold> I'm being facetious.
2011-03-03T18:40:26  <Frontier> McLeopold: A complete new format for the replays !
2011-03-03T18:40:52  <McLeopold> Frontier!  So, what do you think?
2011-03-03T18:41:27  <Frontier> I'm still reading. It might be good :)
2011-03-03T18:41:38  <Frontier> What do I do with the ant owner on food?
2011-03-03T18:41:46  <amstan> McLeopold: it wouldn't really crash
2011-03-03T18:42:08  <amstan> McLeopold: the only problem would be some random annomalies in displaying stuff
2011-03-03T18:42:31  <amstan> McLeopold: only one guy had the 144 org
2011-03-03T18:42:52  <amstan> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=12364
2011-03-03T18:42:59  <amstan> http://ai-contest.com/organization_profile.php?org_id=144
2011-03-03T18:43:03  <amstan> he appears twice
2011-03-03T18:43:05  <amstan> lol
2011-03-03T18:45:06  <Frontier> McLeopold: I see too things that would change: 1. ants that die in a collision fad out at the start of the turn currently, as suggested by antimatroid. now they will just fade out at the end like any other ant that dies
2011-03-03T18:45:21  <Frontier> 2. the scores wont update during the game any more like they use to now
2011-03-03T18:45:22  <McLeopold> Frontier: the ant owner is for hatching an ant from an egg of the right color.  It is redundant, but I thought you might like it.
2011-03-03T18:45:45  <Frontier> ah ok, no i dont like redundancy :)
2011-03-03T18:46:06  <McLeopold> score turn player0 player1...
2011-03-03T18:46:26  <Frontier> ok that would be nice
2011-03-03T18:46:48  <McLeopold> ants colliding is just like ants killing each other.  I don't see why it would be different
2011-03-03T18:47:15  <Frontier> or maybe just a "scores" headline and then the bare numbers in each roe
2011-03-03T18:48:25  <McLeopold> playerXscore 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 4 7 10
2011-03-03T18:48:39  <Frontier> McLeopold: I don't mind the collision stuff myself. antimatroid liked it that way. so the turns are split in 3 parts and one of them is 'move and death from collision' and a later part is 'kills'
2011-03-03T18:49:10  <McLeopold> you can still tell the difference if you track the ants
2011-03-03T18:49:31  <McLeopold> but, let's say 2 ants collide, and also an enemy ant walks in range?
2011-03-03T18:49:36  <Frontier> you are right. and playerXscore is fine for me
2011-03-03T18:49:57  <Frontier> then they would just collide :)
2011-03-03T18:50:04  <McLeopold> I would give the enemy 2 points, and the colliding player 1 point.
2011-03-03T18:50:05  <Frontier> because kill hapens later
2011-03-03T18:50:24  <Frontier> oh ok, so what really happens in the engine is not the same as on screen any more
2011-03-03T18:50:40  <McLeopold> wait, the engine does what you suggested...
2011-03-03T18:50:43  <Frontier> even better, then i have no reason to handle that differently
2011-03-03T18:50:53  <Frontier> what?
2011-03-03T18:51:25  <Frontier> if the ants collide how does the enemy get points?
2011-03-03T18:51:34  <McLeopold> wait, no, it is like what I said
2011-03-03T18:52:24  <McLeopold> no, wrong again
2011-03-03T18:52:44  <McLeopold> jmcarthur/antimatroid: I want to have a rules discussion, regarding scores
2011-03-03T18:52:45  <jmcarthur> where is the code that determines how to run a bot based on the language it's written in?
2011-03-03T18:53:00  <McLeopold> it's in the database
2011-03-03T18:53:10  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-03T18:53:20  <jmcarthur> and i suppose there is no dump of that data?
2011-03-03T18:53:35  <jmcarthur> in the repo
2011-03-03T18:53:36  <McLeopold>  8, Haskell, MyBot.hs, ./MyBot, 1
2011-03-03T18:54:22  <McLeopold> it expects the zip file to contain a 'MyBot.hs' and will compile it to a MyBot file, then run that.
2011-03-03T18:54:24  <jmcarthur> i was thinking it might be better for languages that support it to pass a maximum heap size argument to the bots' runtime systems matching the memory bounds imposed by the sandbox
2011-03-03T18:54:36  <McLeopold> let me check compile stuff
2011-03-03T18:54:43  <janzert> didn't someone already move that out of the database?
2011-03-03T18:54:48  <jmcarthur> that way if a bot is getting close to the memory limit the gc can get more aggressive
2011-03-03T18:54:51  <McLeopold> meanwhile, think about scores for colliding ants when the enemy walks in range
2011-03-03T18:54:52  <janzert> or maybe that was just in zeta
2011-03-03T18:56:03  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: you mean you want to figure out what happens if A collides with B while in range of C?
2011-03-03T18:56:58  <jmcarthur> hmm, just found the compiling stuff. i'm gonna change the ghc compile line to a less insane optimization level
2011-03-03T18:57:40  <McLeopold> "Haskell" : [["ghc", "--make", BOT + ".hs", "-O2", "-v0"]],
2011-03-03T18:58:04  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: on collisions, yes what should happen?
2011-03-03T18:58:07  <jmcarthur> -O is good enough. occasionally -O2 is faster, but usually it's either the same or slower
2011-03-03T18:58:08  <McLeopold> in regards to scorring
2011-03-03T18:58:21  <jmcarthur> i think i had suggested -O2 when we had the older ghc
2011-03-03T18:58:28  <jmcarthur> i have no idea. thinking
2011-03-03T18:58:38  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I'll take your recomendation for haskell compiling
2011-03-03T18:58:49  <McLeopold> also, can we allow user specific options?
2011-03-03T18:59:58  <jmcarthur> i did it already
2011-03-03T19:00:05  <jmcarthur> for compiling?
2011-03-03T19:00:21  <CIA-89> aichallenge: Jake McArthur epsilon * r2024cd1 / manager/compile_anything.py : change ghc optimization flag to -O - http://bit.ly/eW6K3C
2011-03-03T19:00:23  <McLeopold> yes, options for compiling.  might be overkill
2011-03-03T19:00:24  <jmcarthur> users can override them in the source files already, for haskell
2011-03-03T19:00:30  <jmcarthur> err
2011-03-03T19:00:44  <jmcarthur> well, i think the command line overrides, but if the option isn't there already the source file can specify
2011-03-03T19:00:58  <jmcarthur> so they can't set -O2, but they can set, say -funbox-strict-fields, or whatever
2011-03-03T19:01:35  <jmcarthur> okay, there are two cases for the collision thing
2011-03-03T19:01:53  <jmcarthur> if A and B are owned by the same player, that player certainly shouldn't get points for that
2011-03-03T19:02:02  <McLeopold> player c?
2011-03-03T19:02:26  <jmcarthur> the owner of C maybe should
2011-03-03T19:02:40  <McLeopold> that's what I'm thinking
2011-03-03T19:02:55  <jmcarthur> consider if C cornered A and B. if C doesn't get those points then it might be a good idea for A and B to just collide to prevent C from getting them
2011-03-03T19:02:56  <McLeopold> otherwise you could suicide yourself to prevent someone from getting points
2011-03-03T19:02:58  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-03T19:04:07  <McLeopold> I could do the fuse thing, then resolve battles like normal
2011-03-03T19:04:09  <jmcarthur> okay, and in the case that A and B are owned by different players, i think it should be the same as if they had killed each other by range attacks
2011-03-03T19:04:19  <McLeopold> yes, range 0
2011-03-03T19:04:36  <McLeopold> but our current ranges will prevent that
2011-03-03T19:04:43  <McLeopold> they can't get that close
2011-03-03T19:04:46  <jmcarthur> alright, then we're good
2011-03-03T19:05:04  <jmcarthur> i don't like the fusion idea. seems to me they should just kill each other, and any enemies in the area get points from it
2011-03-03T19:05:40  <McLeopold> are we? so a collision (must be same player) is at least 2 points (maybe more) to whoever wandered in range for that turn only?
2011-03-03T19:05:59  <jmcarthur> what do you mean "for that turn only"?
2011-03-03T19:06:17  <McLeopold> the next turn, the points aren't there.  maybe that was too much
2011-03-03T19:06:47  <jmcarthur> i don't see this affecting the strategy negatively, and it keeps the rules simpler
2011-03-03T19:06:51  <McLeopold> if 2 ants are the same distance from the crash site, they share the points
2011-03-03T19:07:13  *** lavalamp <lavalamp!4507d76a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.69.7.215.106> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-03-03T19:07:49  <jmcarthur> so if C and D are around, C gets a point and D gets a point, right?
2011-03-03T19:08:13  <McLeopold> it doesn't open anything up for attack.  You have an ant that got you points and didn't die.  But you'd have to predict the crash and be in range.  If you were wrong, you're ant would die because it is in range of a live enemy.
2011-03-03T19:08:27  <jmcarthur> right
2011-03-03T19:08:34  <McLeopold> yes,c and d share
2011-03-03T19:08:49  <jmcarthur> i'm curious, what happens if the points don't divide evenly?
2011-03-03T19:08:58  <McLeopold> I'm using fractions :)

2011-03-03T19:09:40  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-03T19:09:46  <McLeopold> It's internal to the engine only.
2011-03-03T19:09:50  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-03T19:09:54  <McLeopold> I'll take the floor for the final scores.
2011-03-03T19:10:29  <McLeopold> Frontier: so, does the collision score decision make sense to you?
2011-03-03T19:11:28  <McLeopold> that means colliding ants could look different, but you need to make sure that an enemy ant in range looks like it gets the points, if your doing any point animations

2011-03-03T19:12:32  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: what would be ten times as awesome as being able to give compile flags would be to be able to give runtime flags, at least for haskellers
2011-03-03T19:12:42  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: since that would let you tweak GC settings and stuff
2011-03-03T19:13:29  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: e.g. if i pass +RTS -A1m to my starter, it goes about 10% faster
2011-03-03T19:13:41  <jmcarthur> but that wouldn't apply for all bots
2011-03-03T19:13:57  <McLeopold> so, who's the compiling chancellor?
2011-03-03T19:14:17  <Frontier> ...czar or ceasar
2011-03-03T19:14:49  <jmcarthur> if we do bash scripts i might just go with that
2011-03-03T19:14:58  <McLeopold> I think we will
2011-03-03T19:15:05  <Frontier> McLeopold: I'm not going to animate points. I would have to implement more game play code than I should :p
2011-03-03T19:15:08  <jmcarthur> means i have to upload binaries, but oh well
2011-03-03T19:15:21  <McLeopold> but, you'd lose your 'haskell' tag on the leader board
2011-03-03T19:15:42  <jmcarthur> okay fine, i'll make a haskell program that runs a binary
2011-03-03T19:15:45  <jmcarthur> :P

2011-03-03T19:16:31  <jmcarthur> are we wanting to have all the starters in the aichallenge repo?
2011-03-03T19:16:36  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-03T19:16:49  <McLeopold> put it in ants/bots/haskell
2011-03-03T19:16:50  <Frontier> why not :), LOLCODE is also waiting
2011-03-03T19:16:52  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-03T19:17:01  <McLeopold> yeah, check out my lolcode!
2011-03-03T19:17:58  <jmcarthur> what would you say i should do with the library that mine will be dependent on? sticking it in bots/haskell would make it look like a part of the starter, but the intent is for it to not be included with the tarballs
2011-03-03T19:17:59  <McLeopold> janzert: do we really need an unknown language in the database?  is that before upload?
2011-03-03T19:18:19  <McLeopold> we'll have a script to make the tarballs
2011-03-03T19:18:26  <McLeopold> it can not include it
2011-03-03T19:18:46  <McLeopold> but, if you don't want your library in the repo, don't put it there
2011-03-03T19:18:52  <janzert> I think it's for before the compile daemon runs on the submission and also if the daemon can't determine the language
2011-03-03T19:19:02  <jmcarthur> i don't mind it being in the repo. i just don't want it in the starters
2011-03-03T19:19:29  <amstan> jmcarthur: it shouldn't really be in the repo, if the library is only used in the starter and you don't want to include it in the starter
2011-03-03T19:19:36  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-03T19:19:42  <McLeopold> anyone want to create the tarball creation script?
2011-03-03T19:19:46  <amstan> McLeopold: sure
2011-03-03T19:20:23  <McLeopold> the starter pack directories have example bots (hunter) that shouldn't be included either.
2011-03-03T19:20:26  <jmcarthur> for DIR in ants/bots/*; do; tar czf $DIR.tar.gz $DIR; done
2011-03-03T19:20:30  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-03T19:20:36  <jmcarthur> nevermind then
2011-03-03T19:20:37  <amstan> jmcarthur: i wanna do a makefile
2011-03-03T19:20:56  <jmcarthur> amstan: for the tarballs for for each starter?
2011-03-03T19:21:00  <jmcarthur> *or for
2011-03-03T19:21:06  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah
2011-03-03T19:21:27  <McLeopold> one in each starter does make sense, the starter pack writer is responsible for it
2011-03-03T19:21:34  <jmcarthur> i mean, you want to do a makefile to generate the tarballs or you want to put a makefile in each starter pack?
2011-03-03T19:21:44  <amstan> jmcarthur: both? yeah.. both
2011-03-03T19:22:03  <jmcarthur> hmm... if the language has a common project system should the starter use that?
2011-03-03T19:22:20  <amstan> jmcarthur: define common project system
2011-03-03T19:22:28  <jmcarthur> haskell projects don't usually use make
2011-03-03T19:22:32  <jmcarthur> they use cabal
2011-03-03T19:22:45  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah, use cabal
2011-03-03T19:23:03  <jmcarthur> *sometimes* they will also have a makefile that just calls the appropriate cabal commands, but the makefile doesn't even do dependency tracking, normally
2011-03-03T19:23:05  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-03T19:23:07  <amstan> i think i'll only do a makefile for c++
2011-03-03T19:23:16  <jmcarthur> and i guess just include instructions for building
2011-03-03T19:23:21  <amstan> jmcarthur: readme.md
2011-03-03T19:23:22  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: "the engine outputs the player count and scores before giving the final game state, but the spec says it's the other way around"
2011-03-03T19:23:42  <antimatroid1> why would the engine give it before? it doesn't really matter surely, i can change it though
2011-03-03T19:23:53  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: it always gave it before, afaik
2011-03-03T19:24:40  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: end\nplayers 6\nscore 3 7 4 6 2 4\n<game state>
2011-03-03T19:25:21  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: also, in case you missed it, your bot isn't outputting "o" at the beginning of order lines
2011-03-03T19:26:29  <jmcarthur> amstan: should we make the compiler stuff on the server use the build system?
2011-03-03T19:26:46  <amstan> jmcarthur: jeff is against that
2011-03-03T19:26:50  <amstan> jmcarthur: or.. idk

2011-03-03T19:26:51  <amstan> nvm
2011-03-03T19:26:56  <jmcarthur> because if not then we almost don't want to encourage the use of makefiles, cabal projects, etc.
2011-03-03T19:27:11  <antimatroid1> ah yeah, i'll fix the orders after
2011-03-03T19:27:13  <jmcarthur> like... including them by default might imply that changing them will change how they are built on the server
2011-03-03T19:27:20  <amstan> jmcarthur: i think he wants to stay with compile_everything for now
2011-03-03T19:27:37  <amstan> jmcarthur: but there's nothing stopping us from including makefiles for people's machines
2011-03-03T19:27:52  <jmcarthur> yeah.... but then i should definitely *not* be using a cabal project
2011-03-03T19:28:05  <jmcarthur> since cabal doesn't use the same build commands that the server does
2011-03-03T19:28:26  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah, don't make your project dependent on the build system, that wouldn't be a good idea even if we did allow it on the server
2011-03-03T19:29:13  <jmcarthur> i just don't really like that we're encouraging the use of build systems that aren't used on the server
2011-03-03T19:29:22  <jmcarthur> seems confusing
2011-03-03T19:30:06  <amstan> jmcarthur: we're not encouraging, we're just providing makefiles for easier compilation on the contestants machines

2011-03-03T19:30:27  <jbroman> Either we change the server to choose Make/Ant/scons/cabal/etc., or we should omit them for clarify.

2011-03-03T19:30:34  <amstan> jmcarthur: just include a big warning that the makefile won't be used
2011-03-03T19:30:34  <jmcarthur> what he said
2011-03-03T19:31:01  <amstan> ugh
2011-03-03T19:31:02  <jbroman> Hopefully anyone writing C++ will know how it is compiled, and if not we can put a list of how the server will compile code on the wbsite.
2011-03-03T19:31:20  <amstan> jbroman: sadly a lot of beginners don't
2011-03-03T19:31:34  <amstan> but nvm, those beginners won't know how to use makefiles either
2011-03-03T19:31:37  <jbroman> amstan: I'm not sure how they would've gotten past "Hello, world!" without being able to compile?
2011-03-03T19:31:38  <antimatroid1> amstan: tell them to make a new project in something like code::blocks, it does all the linking for them
2011-03-03T19:32:01  <Zannick> makefiles would be really hax on the server
2011-03-03T19:32:21  <McLeopold> I was thinking we were talking about makefiles for making the starter bot tarball only?  The make file wouldn't be in the tarball.
2011-03-03T19:32:25  <amstan> Zannick: why?
2011-03-03T19:32:33  <amstan> Zannick: sandbox compilation, then run the makefiles
2011-03-03T19:32:35  <Zannick> the compile script would have to generate a makefile based on the files
2011-03-03T19:32:39  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i asked for clarification and got the response "both"
2011-03-03T19:32:47  <Zannick> or copy one in
2011-03-03T19:32:58  <McLeopold> makefiles are overkill
2011-03-03T19:33:10  <jbroman> Zannick: Presumably if we went that route, we'd include Makefiles in starter packs and require them. Not advocating this, but I don't think there's a technical obstacle.
2011-03-03T19:33:22  <jmcarthur> jbroman: there is
2011-03-03T19:33:28  <jmcarthur> jbroman: compilation isn't sandboxed right now
2011-03-03T19:33:41  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Ah right, I'm still living in zeta-land.
2011-03-03T19:33:50  <janzert> which really needs to be fixed
2011-03-03T19:34:00  <Zannick> makefiles in starters is good, because it allows users to adjust parameters
2011-03-03T19:34:01  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-03T19:34:09  <Zannick> i wouldn't advocate giving them the whole compile script
2011-03-03T19:34:59  <amstan> maybe we should have a vote, allow users to customize compiling(with makefiles, bash scripts, etc.)? or continue using compile_anything.py
2011-03-03T19:35:09  <jmcarthur> i don't want to vote on that yet
2011-03-03T19:35:20  <jmcarthur> i'd rather discuss a little more
2011-03-03T19:35:43  <jmcarthur> first thing's first, though. how much trouble would it be to sandbox compilation?
2011-03-03T19:35:44  <antimatroid1> could it use makefile if it's there otherwise the python script?
2011-03-03T19:36:13  <jbroman> In Zeta, compilation is sandboxed. Is it ultimately cooler to compile based on a Makefile/Rakefile/build.xml/whatever or based on custom commands?
2011-03-03T19:36:17  <amstan> jmcarthur: well.. compilation should be sandboxed either way, we still have a few leaks on it, apparently the CL compiler also allows compile time code execution
2011-03-03T19:36:33  <Zannick> antimatroid1: if we decide to allow makefile, that's a reasonable way to provide a default
2011-03-03T19:36:39  <jbroman> As a "power user", I like being able to use a build tool, but j3camero would almost certainly call it intimidating.
2011-03-03T19:36:40  <McLeopold> I need a generic work for 'skill in relation to hunterbot'.
2011-03-03T19:36:42  <jmcarthur> amstan: and there are other ways to do it with ghc as well, aside from the way we "fixed" in the last contest
2011-03-03T19:36:43  <amstan> jbroman: i was thinking to call a ./compile.sh, which has "make" in it

2011-03-03T19:37:19  <jbroman> amstan: Aesthetically, I don't like that. Not that it really matters, as most build systems can be adapted onto one another.
2011-03-03T19:37:22  <chemuduguntar> what about using a qemu vm ?
2011-03-03T19:37:32  <jbroman> qemu is WAY overkill
2011-03-03T19:37:36  <jbroman> (imho)
2011-03-03T19:37:43  <jbroman> I think running as a separate user is the way to go.
2011-03-03T19:38:06  <jmcarthur> jbroman: IMO, beginners could be nudge toward sticking to the main source file or something. they needn't even mess with the makefile
2011-03-03T19:38:09  <jmcarthur> *nudged
2011-03-03T19:38:10  <chemuduguntar> may i suggest than also using a chroot jail

2011-03-03T19:38:34  <jmcarthur> jbroman: the thing i like about compile.sh is it is universal
2011-03-03T19:38:37  <amstan> regarding sandboxed compilation, what jeff was worried about, is that the current system does not allow file writes(what if they create a huge file), and for compilation you need file writes
2011-03-03T19:38:46  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Universal to Unix, anyhow.
2011-03-03T19:38:52  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-03T19:38:56  <amstan> jbroman: servers are in unix
2011-03-03T19:38:58  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Many people do Java on Windows and use Ant there.
2011-03-03T19:39:00  <Zannick> amstan: two different sandbox types
2011-03-03T19:39:03  <jbroman> amstan: I know.
2011-03-03T19:39:08  <Zannick> oh
2011-03-03T19:39:13  <jmcarthur> i'd say that is marks against compile.sh, yes
2011-03-03T19:39:22  <Zannick> if we allow build systems, we will get requests for build systems
2011-03-03T19:39:24  <amstan> jbroman: as long as they include the proper ant command in the command.sh, they should be ok
2011-03-03T19:39:30  <jmcarthur> if it's there, it's encouragement to use it
2011-03-03T19:39:31  <Zannick> and need to publish which ones/versions we have
2011-03-03T19:39:44  <jmcarthur> amstan: not on windows
2011-03-03T19:39:46  <amstan> Zannick: yes, but we can just apt-get them
2011-03-03T19:39:52  <jbroman> amstan: Well sure; as I said, they can all be adapted onto one another. You could have a Makefile with "./compile.sh" as the instruction for all. That's not the point.
2011-03-03T19:39:56  <Zannick> just as fun as talking about which compiler/interpreter we have :)
2011-03-03T19:40:15  <jmcarthur> well, it at least doesn't have the proper file extensions for windows :P
2011-03-03T19:40:22  <jmcarthur> *extension
2011-03-03T19:40:51  <jmcarthur> Zannick: i'd say it would be reasonable to only include a build system if it's the most common build system for a particular language
2011-03-03T19:40:57  <amstan> jbroman: just making sure i'm understood, the point of the ./compile.sh is just to bootstrap the build system, it doesn't actually compile anything. As long as the build system is cross platform, it won't matter that compile.sh only runs on unix
2011-03-03T19:41:21  <jbroman> amstan: Yeah, and I'm saying that that is not an attribute unique to shell scripts.
2011-03-03T19:41:23  <Zannick> well, we can't run non-unix build systems
2011-03-03T19:41:37  <jbroman> Zannick: We can run non-Unix-only build systems, however.
2011-03-03T19:41:46  <Zannick> yes
2011-03-03T19:41:54  <jmcarthur> okay yeah, further requirement that it be cross platform
2011-03-03T19:42:14  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: MyBot.lol :D
2011-03-03T19:42:18  <jmcarthur> the most common cross-platform build system for each language should be present
2011-03-03T19:42:27  <jmcarthur> i image most languages come with those anyway, if there is one
2011-03-03T19:42:50  <Zannick> that, or they use make
2011-03-03T19:43:10  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: oh, not sure if you saw... my bot is as fast as yours now, and is 10% faster if i tweak the GC settings a little
2011-03-03T19:43:13  <jbroman> This is why I kind of like the "search for one of {Makefile, build.xml, Rakefile, Sconsfile, …}" approach, similar to how compilation is done now. A side disadvantage is that it's harder to tell what language is being used (in fact, chimeras are more likely to exist).
2011-03-03T19:43:20  <amstan> I don't think build systems will be as essential to have as languages, and they'll be much easier to setup(you just install them, no need to configure the contest to use it). The user's choice will only be shown in the compile.sh file
2011-03-03T19:43:36  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: oh it's on, what version of mine were you using?
2011-03-03T19:43:48  <jmcarthur> i think whether to go with compile.sh or just the build system is bikeshedding
2011-03-03T19:43:51  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: the current on in the repo
2011-03-03T19:43:53  <jmcarthur> *one
2011-03-03T19:44:04  <antimatroid1> challenge accepted
2011-03-03T19:44:07  <jmcarthur> :D
2011-03-03T19:44:12  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Oh sure, but bikeshedding is about 60% of what goes on in here anyhow.
2011-03-03T19:44:32  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i fully expect that in an actual competition of this sort C++ should win any day
2011-03-03T19:44:42  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: as long as you work hard enough on it
2011-03-03T19:44:44  <antimatroid1> i sort of agree unfortunately
2011-03-03T19:45:09  <antimatroid1> planet wars was good with language choice being fairly irrelevant
2011-03-03T19:45:14  <jmcarthur> i *do* like the idea of the server supporting build systems
2011-03-03T19:45:31  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i meant speed-focused competition
2011-03-03T19:45:38  <amstan> jbroman: can you please remind me, how do you get globs in makefile? i wanna do something like SOURCES = *.c
2011-03-03T19:45:40  <antimatroid1> that's what i mean :P
2011-03-03T19:45:58  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: but still... it takes a lot of work to push C++ beyond its normal limits
2011-03-03T19:46:14  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: whereas with haskell, it starts out slower but it's actually pretty easy to optimize :D
2011-03-03T19:46:30  <jbroman> amstan: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard-Function
2011-03-03T19:46:39  <amstan> yay, that one
2011-03-03T19:47:03  <Zannick> i would just generate the Makefile, SOURCES = `ls *.c`
2011-03-03T19:47:06  <Zannick> :P
2011-03-03T19:47:14  <Zannick> probably not the best way to do it
2011-03-03T19:47:29  <Zannick> but then again, we've reinvented the wheel multiple times with compile_anything
2011-03-03T19:47:43  <jbroman> Zannick: You probably run "echo $(date)" instead of simply "date", don't you?
2011-03-03T19:47:50  <Zannick> what
2011-03-03T19:48:03  <jbroman> Never mind.
2011-03-03T19:48:08  <Zannick> no, of course not
2011-03-03T19:48:15  <Zannick> i run "echo `date`"
2011-03-03T19:48:16  <Zannick> :P
2011-03-03T19:48:22  <Zannick> no shift key needed

2011-03-03T19:59:40  <antimatroid1> hmm, can't really see where to speed things up, i moved to just 2 abs calcuations in distance instead of 4, but i don't think my bot is even using that function
2011-03-03T20:00:38  <jmcarthur> i used profiling to help me
2011-03-03T20:01:31  <jmcarthur> oh btw, in the interest of fairness, what flags are you passing to g++?
2011-03-03T20:01:44  <jmcarthur> i was only using -O3. if you think i should do something else, i'm up for trying it
2011-03-03T20:03:34  <Zannick> the server flags?
2011-03-03T20:03:37  <jmcarthur> looks like compile_anything is using -funroll-loops
2011-03-03T20:03:41  <jmcarthur> i'll try with that
2011-03-03T20:03:52  <Zannick> in epsilon, yeah
2011-03-03T20:03:57  <Zannick> i removed that from zeta
2011-03-03T20:04:01  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-03T20:04:12  <Zannick> the linker still uses -O2
2011-03-03T20:04:38  <jmcarthur> i'm kind of surprised to see -funroll-loops there. i've always thought it only sometimes helped
2011-03-03T20:05:12  <Zannick> i don't know why it was included
2011-03-03T20:05:21  <janzert> jmcarthur: it probably does, I think it's there because someone requested it during tron
2011-03-03T20:05:26  <Zannick> and there were two bugs (?) opened during planet wars asking to remove it
2011-03-03T20:05:32  <janzert> and no ones ripped it back out since
2011-03-03T20:06:15  <Zannick> sounds like an argument to let makefiles/compile.sh scripts in
2011-03-03T20:06:50  <janzert> yep, but compilation needs to be sandboxed first
2011-03-03T20:06:52  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: i don't play around with those myself
2011-03-03T20:07:09  <antimatroid1> you could try adding "cout.sync_with_stdio(0);" to the very start of main and seeing if it is any faster
2011-03-03T20:07:27  <jmcarthur> alright
2011-03-03T20:08:14  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: yeah that helped a lot
2011-03-03T20:08:20  <jmcarthur> you are ahead again

2011-03-03T20:17:49  <amstan> i feel like i just wasted 30 min with that v
2011-03-03T20:18:13  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: you gained 33% of your time back from that, btw
2011-03-03T20:18:22  <jmcarthur> so i have to do something pretty drastic now
2011-03-03T20:19:43  <amstan> so.. what happened with (compile.sh calling build systems) vs (compile_everything.py)?
2011-03-03T20:20:17  <jmcarthur> amstan: vs. (putting build systems into compile_everything.py instead of languages)?
2011-03-03T20:20:48  <jmcarthur> amstan: i like the idea of using build systems on the server. so much more flexible that way. whether it's directly or through the use of compile.sh, i don't care.
2011-03-03T20:20:48  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: does it make it any faster if you do the same with cin?
2011-03-03T20:20:52  <amstan> jmcarthur: but what advantage does that have compared to compile.sh?
2011-03-03T20:21:12  <jmcarthur> amstan: just cleanliness i guess. i like i said, i don't really care
2011-03-03T20:21:20  <jmcarthur> amstan: jbroman seems a bit more against it than me
2011-03-03T20:21:29  <amstan> jbroman: same question
2011-03-03T20:21:32  <jmcarthur> s/i l/l/
2011-03-03T20:21:39  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i'll try it
2011-03-03T20:21:42  <antimatroid1> :)
2011-03-03T20:21:52  <jbroman> Same deal – I just like not having extraneous files if I can avoid it. But not a huge deal, really.
2011-03-03T20:21:55  <antimatroid1> i have no idea why that makes it faster, but my friend gave me that trick
2011-03-03T20:22:05  <antimatroid1> it actually becomes faster than using c-style io too i think
2011-03-03T20:22:11  <amstan> jbroman: is it really cleaner to have a huge ass build_everything.py, with all the build systems in the world, than just compile.sh in every submission

2011-03-03T20:22:27  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-03-03T20:22:28  <jbroman> amstan: If we can do away with all of that, sure.
2011-03-03T20:22:29  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-03T20:22:45  <antimatroid1> oh, just stdio i think
2011-03-03T20:22:49  <jbroman> If that goes over well, I'd be very happy to dump all of that logic out of it.
2011-03-03T20:22:51  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-03-03T20:22:53  <antimatroid1> it wont compile otherwise anyway
2011-03-03T20:22:55  <jmcarthur> yeah that gave "MyBot.cc:16:5: error: ‘struct std::istream’ has no member named ‘sync_with_stdin’"
2011-03-03T20:22:57  <amstan> jbroman: thing is, that if we get a build_everything.py, then every time someone wants a new build system installed, we have to edit that file for them
2011-03-03T20:22:58  <jbroman> One thing that would be nice is if you could return the proper exit code.
2011-03-03T20:23:06  <jmcarthur> oh i misread it
2011-03-03T20:23:11  <jmcarthur> i read it as stdout
2011-03-03T20:23:11  <amstan> jbroman: with compile.sh, they just need to call the new system, all we have to do is apt-get it
2011-03-03T20:23:11  <jbroman> (i.e. don't return 0 on failure)
2011-03-03T20:23:38  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i think that one hurt it
2011-03-03T20:23:57  <McLeopold> I need git help
2011-03-03T20:23:57  <antimatroid1> ah cool, that lines now gone, cheers
2011-03-03T20:24:01  <amstan> McLeopold: fire away
2011-03-03T20:24:04  <jmcarthur> just barely
2011-03-03T20:24:38  <antimatroid1> my friend said he thinks it's syncing cout and c stream thing whenever one calls endl, giving the change in time
2011-03-03T20:24:42  <jbroman> amstan: My point is that if someone puts sequential commands in there, you end up with situations where someone puts "make; echo WOOHOO", which will always exit "successfully" (since echo returns 0).
2011-03-03T20:24:46  <antimatroid1> so one didn't expect much difference with cin if that was the case
2011-03-03T20:25:03  <jbroman> amstan: It makes it trickier to distinguish successful compilation from unsuccessful compilation in such instances.
2011-03-03T20:25:12  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: what exactly is meant by "syncing" there?
2011-03-03T20:25:25  <McLeopold> amstan: nvm, my new file is there
2011-03-03T20:25:35  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: you can pull Bot.java now
2011-03-03T20:25:35  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/ios_base/sync_with_stdio/
2011-03-03T20:25:35  <amstan> jbroman: compile.txt? with the one command that's supposed to execute?
2011-03-03T20:26:12  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: k
2011-03-03T20:26:13  <jbroman> amstan: Nah, shell script beats that. Hopefully most people will just call a build system or compiler, most of which give nice exit codes.
2011-03-03T20:26:23  <jbroman> (Otherwise, the error is still caught. At runtime, if necessary.)
2011-03-03T20:26:41  <antimatroid1> i should have read that page more, i think the cout line turned it off for cin anyway
2011-03-03T20:26:53  <jbroman> It would also be nice if we could get rid of the running logic in a similar way.
2011-03-03T20:26:59  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: run with just 'java RandomBot.class'?
2011-03-03T20:27:00  <amstan> jbroman: a comment in compile.sh? something like: "Please make sure this script does not return successfully on build error"
2011-03-03T20:27:44  <jmcarthur> nope that's fail
2011-03-03T20:28:02  <jmcarthur> oh do i need to be in that directory to run it?
2011-03-03T20:28:04  <jbroman> jmcarthur: IIRC, java takes class names, not class files.
2011-03-03T20:28:19  <jbroman> So you specify the (fully qualified) name of the class, which must exist in the classpath with that name.
2011-03-03T20:28:26  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-03-03T20:28:26  <jbroman> "." is in the classpath, naturally.
2011-03-03T20:28:38  <jmcarthur> how do i add a classpath?
2011-03-03T20:28:45  <jmcarthur> *add to it
2011-03-03T20:28:56  <jbroman> So if I have foo.bar.Application in foo/bar/Application.class, I run it with "java foo.bar.Application" . I think -cp adds to the classpath.
2011-03-03T20:29:02  <jmcarthur> i'm not in the directory with it
2011-03-03T20:29:21  <jbroman> -cp path_to_classpath

2011-03-03T20:29:52  <jbroman> Most final Java apps are packaged as jars, which are executed with -jar instead (they include a metadata file which specifies the class to run).
2011-03-03T20:30:06  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-03T20:30:10  <jmcarthur> i'm used to those
2011-03-03T20:30:20  <jmcarthur> dangit. i'll just run from there
2011-03-03T20:30:37  <McLeopold> that's easiest
2011-03-03T20:30:46  <McLeopold> or you can have my build file if you have ant?
2011-03-03T20:31:15  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: it seems to just be burning cpu...
2011-03-03T20:31:37  <jmcarthur> i don't have ant but i could get it if it's not huge (low on hd space)
2011-03-03T20:31:58  <jbroman> jmcarthur: It's annoying, but it does work if the directory structure is correct.
2011-03-03T20:32:03  <McLeopold> I just run it from eclipse, I'm not an ant expert
2011-03-03T20:32:11  <jmcarthur> hmm... it worked that time...
2011-03-03T20:32:32  <jmcarthur> it's not running in a bash for loop though
2011-03-03T20:32:35  <jmcarthur> weird
2011-03-03T20:33:01  <McLeopold> so, the main optimization I could make has to do with string parsing the input
2011-03-03T20:33:20  <McLeopold> I'm building strings and then spliting them later
2011-03-03T20:33:31  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: the C++ bot is 20 times faster
2011-03-03T20:33:36  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-03T20:33:50  <antimatroid1> that's alright if he's doing input like that
2011-03-03T20:33:55  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-03T20:33:56  <antimatroid1> provided input is still done in almost no time
2011-03-03T20:34:14  <antimatroid1> i'm reading straight into variables
2011-03-03T20:34:30  <McLeopold> did you take into account jvm load time?

2011-03-03T20:35:24  <antimatroid1> you'd need to time it inside the program i think
2011-03-03T20:35:32  <McLeopold> the java split command is a regex, can't look for single characters
2011-03-03T20:35:47  <jmcarthur> well, i'm also counting ghc's runtime warmup
2011-03-03T20:35:55  <jmcarthur> there isn't much, but it's more than c++
2011-03-03T20:36:38  <McLeopold> I read a technique for parsing integers that was faster than parseInt if you get 1 char at a time.
2011-03-03T20:37:23  <McLeopold> But I think I was still running 1000 turns in about 15 seconds on hunter, which is good enough
2011-03-03T20:37:38  <amstan> New issues about compilation: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues#issue/15 and https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues#issue/16
2011-03-03T20:37:41  <jmcarthur> o_O
2011-03-03T20:38:11  <McLeopold> why the surprise?
2011-03-03T20:38:55  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: mine is doing 14,300 turns per second
2011-03-03T20:39:12  <Frontier> how did you test that?
2011-03-03T20:39:37  <jmcarthur> Frontier: badly. it's actually biased against it. i have an input file with 843 turns and i divided that by how many seconds it took
2011-03-03T20:39:39  <McLeopold> with random4.txt?
2011-03-03T20:39:54  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: it was one of antimatroid1's randomly generated maps
2011-03-03T20:40:02  <jmcarthur> the original run was
2011-03-03T20:40:09  <jmcarthur> this is the input file from that run
2011-03-03T20:40:13  <jmcarthur> for one of the bots
2011-03-03T20:40:24  <McLeopold> I did the same thing, took a bot input file and ran it through the java bot
2011-03-03T20:40:33  <McLeopold> maybe it was faster?
2011-03-03T20:40:37  <McLeopold> Now I can remember
2011-03-03T20:40:57  <jmcarthur> i suspect you are just remembering wrong
2011-03-03T20:41:17  <jmcarthur> it's going through this 843 turn game in less than a second
2011-03-03T20:41:18  <McLeopold> I remember optimizing from 39 seconds down to something
2011-03-03T20:41:20  <jmcarthur> including warmup time
2011-03-03T20:41:31  <jmcarthur> the java one, i mean
2011-03-03T20:42:36  <McLeopold> I also created a huge map for tests, maybe that was the difference.
2011-03-03T20:42:47  <McLeopold> There were 100's of ants in the replay.
2011-03-03T20:42:54  <jmcarthur> i don't know how many there are in this game

2011-03-03T20:53:02  <amstan> McLeopold: hold on.. the way i set the sql folder was so that you could just run mysql *.sql and the db would be created
2011-03-03T20:53:12  <McLeopold> oops
2011-03-03T20:53:26  <McLeopold> It will need some cleanup
2011-03-03T20:53:31  <amstan> McLeopold: the reason i renamed schema to have 000 in front was so it would be executed first
2011-03-03T20:53:40  <McLeopold> I've got a lot of the php files changed, but I'm not going to push them yet
2011-03-03T20:53:49  <amstan> McLeopold: make a branch then
2011-03-03T20:54:06  <amstan> and push that
2011-03-03T20:54:22  <McLeopold> that requires me to learn branches
2011-03-03T20:54:31  <jmcarthur> git checkout -b newbranch
2011-03-03T20:54:41  <jmcarthur> makes a branch from your current tree
2011-03-03T20:54:49  <amstan> McLeopold: git checkout branchname to move between them
2011-03-03T20:55:21  <McLeopold> I'll have to do it later, but okay.
2011-03-03T20:55:22  * jmcarthur is glad to be a darcs user in this sort of case
2011-03-03T20:55:29  <jmcarthur> branches are rarely even necessary
2011-03-03T20:55:33  <amstan> branches are awesome..
2011-03-03T20:55:40  <amstan> in git.. not svn
2011-03-03T20:55:56  <jmcarthur> branches are awesome until you realize there are even awesomer alternatives for a majority of cases
2011-03-03T20:56:12  <jmcarthur> like real cherrypicking
2011-03-03T20:56:26  <amstan> yay, cherry picking
2011-03-03T20:56:32  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@barracuda.imagesourceinc.com> has left #aichallenge
2011-03-03T20:56:34  <jmcarthur> and git's version of that sucks
2011-03-03T20:56:44  <amstan> does it? worked fine for me
2011-03-03T20:56:52  <jmcarthur> it changes the commit's identity
2011-03-03T20:57:07  <jmcarthur> you can't keep doing it or else you will start getting tons of conflicts
2011-03-03T20:57:36  <amstan> that's because of git's design, how every commit depends on the parent commits
2011-03-03T20:58:22  <jmcarthur> for example, in darcs i can commit A, then B, then C, then D. i can then push commits B and D to a public repo without having to worry about whether that will mess with A and C and without having to explicitly reorder them first
2011-03-03T20:58:34  <jmcarthur> yeah. and i'm just saying i consider git's design to be a problem
2011-03-03T20:58:38  <jmcarthur> in this regard
2011-03-03T20:59:17  <jmcarthur> also, people who have B and D can pull A or C from me without fear, either
2011-03-03T21:00:10  <amstan> jmcarthur: so.. if you can cherry pick B without changing its identity, then git checkout B
2011-03-03T21:00:17  <amstan> then git checkout HEAD^1
2011-03-03T21:00:19  <amstan> where are you then?
2011-03-03T21:00:29  <amstan> if it didn't change its identity it would have 2 parents
2011-03-03T21:00:32  <jmcarthur> wait, i'm trying to figure out what scenario you are talking about
2011-03-03T21:00:37  <jmcarthur> i'm talking about darcs, not git
2011-03-03T21:00:46  <amstan> HEAD^1 means.. go to the parent commit
2011-03-03T21:00:55  <jmcarthur> patches don't have parents in darcs. they have dependencies
2011-03-03T21:00:56  <amstan> if git didn't have changing hashes like that
2011-03-03T21:01:07  <amstan> hmm
2011-03-03T21:01:13  <amstan> weird
2011-03-03T21:01:27  <amstan> i'm sure it works somehow.. there's just pros and cons
2011-03-03T21:01:29  <jmcarthur> a patch only depends on past patches that touch the same code that it does
2011-03-03T21:01:31  <amstan> it's just different
2011-03-03T21:01:42  <jmcarthur> not on *all* past patches like in git
2011-03-03T21:02:00  <amstan> jmcarthur: i'm sure that because of this design in git, it has the con that you said, but it has a pro somewhere else
2011-03-03T21:02:11  <jmcarthur> the pro is that it's a little faster
2011-03-03T21:02:32  <jmcarthur> less information and fewer transformations
2011-03-03T21:02:52  <jmcarthur> also, it makes things like in-place branching make sense at all
2011-03-03T21:02:58  <jmcarthur> make no sense in darcs, really
2011-03-03T21:03:21  <jmcarthur> then again, you could say that in darcs *every* patch you record is a new branch, in some sense
2011-03-03T21:03:32  <antimatroid1> wtf, mazda has done a recall on cars because "ants like them and have been laying their eggs in them"
2011-03-03T21:03:40  <antimatroid1> ants == spiders
2011-03-03T21:06:02  <jmcarthur> amstan: the closest approximation i can think of for that scenario you came up with is to 'darcs obliterate' patch B
2011-03-03T21:06:20  <jmcarthur> amstan: and obliterate doesn't even care if patch B is the most recent patch, so... still only a loose approximation

2011-03-03T21:09:54  <jmcarthur> amstan: if you think of darcs like a package manage and patches like packages, you might have a decent idea of what the model is like

2011-03-03T21:18:00  <janzert> what can't you install numpy with 2.7?
2011-03-03T21:18:49  <janzert> http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.5.1/ has a prebuilt package for 2.7 on windows even
2011-03-03T21:19:00  <antimatroid1> dunno, it says it needs 2.6 then says pick a package and there aren't any :\
2011-03-03T21:19:25  <antimatroid1> downloading that now, cheers
2011-03-03T21:19:42  <antimatroid1> i grabbed a perlin noise library off the web, but it uses numpy
2011-03-03T21:21:35  <janzert> Oh no, GHC 7 was released today
2011-03-03T21:21:51  <jmcarthur> ghc 7 was already out
2011-03-03T21:21:51  <janzert> now were going to have all the haskell fans demanding we have it :P
2011-03-03T21:21:53  <jmcarthur> this is an update
2011-03-03T21:21:58  <janzert> ahh
2011-03-03T21:22:00  <jmcarthur> nah, 6.12 is reasonable enough
2011-03-03T21:22:08  <jmcarthur> 6.8 was ridiculous
2011-03-03T21:23:28  <jmcarthur> but i wouldn't complain if ghc 7 was on the server ;)

2011-03-03T21:34:10  <antimatroid1> janzert: am i meant to be doing something after instlaling for python to find the module Numeric?
2011-03-03T21:34:59  <janzert> I've never actually used numpy, but if it has a Numeric module you should just be able to "import Numeric"
2011-03-03T21:35:02  <Frontier> No, but I haven't worked much on the visualizer since my last git commit I think
2011-03-03T21:37:29  <antimatroid1> janzert: i do that, but it claims it can't find it, hmmm
2011-03-03T21:38:18  <janzert> wasn't numeric the predecessor of numpy or did it just get folded in and expanded?
2011-03-03T21:38:28  <sigh> why are you using Numeric and not numpy
2011-03-03T21:38:37  <sigh> janzert: yes, i think so
2011-03-03T21:38:58  <antimatroid1> sigh: i got a perlin noise thing off the net

2011-03-03T21:40:20  <janzert> looking at the numpy documentation it looks like everything is under the numpy package
2011-03-03T21:40:37  <sigh> then try: s/Numeric/numpy/g
2011-03-03T21:40:38  <sigh> :P
2011-03-03T21:41:28  <janzert> yeah, looks like that code is from 2001 before numpy was around
2011-03-03T21:41:49  <antimatroid1> sigh: ?
2011-03-03T21:41:55  <janzert> and I have no idea how close the numpy api is to the old numeric one
2011-03-03T21:42:04  <sigh> yeah, I have no idea
2011-03-03T21:42:08  <antimatroid1> i'll try a different package
2011-03-03T21:42:26  <sigh> it's just the first thing I would try (or import numpy as Numeric), just ot se if it worked
2011-03-03T21:42:36  <sigh> *just to see
2011-03-03T21:42:47  * janzert nods
2011-03-03T21:42:47  <antimatroid1> yeah, no, what do you mean?
2011-03-03T21:42:57  <antimatroid1> replace that in the import line?
2011-03-03T21:43:07  <sigh> sure, worth a shot
2011-03-03T21:43:32  <sigh> if the API hasn't changed for the functions you are using then you will get lucky and it will work
2011-03-03T21:44:46  <sigh> ah, it's stupid and has "from Numeric import *"
2011-03-03T21:45:04  <sigh> so just try "from numpy import *"
2011-03-03T21:46:51  <antimatroid1> i think that worked for the moment, cheers
2011-03-03T21:46:57  <sigh> cool :)
2011-03-03T21:46:59  <antimatroid1> i need pygame now before i know if it'll run though
2011-03-03T21:47:11  <sigh> ahh
2011-03-03T21:47:57  <antimatroid1> hmm, i thinki sohuld maybe just try another package aha

2011-03-03T22:13:06  <jmcarthur> chrome
2011-03-03T22:13:35  <jmcarthur> and "empty" turned into "applet tag"

2011-03-03T22:13:51  <jmcarthur> i don't have ie handy though
2011-03-03T22:13:56  <Frontier> chrome supports it? why not on my box with chromium :(
2011-03-03T22:14:17  <Frontier> maybe i should just copy the files over to my windows partition and reboot
2011-03-03T22:20:06  <janzert> works in IE8

2011-03-03T22:21:08  <Frontier> cannot be
2011-03-03T22:21:19  <Frontier> IE8 should support the object tag

2011-03-03T22:22:11  <janzert> myText set to applet tag
2011-03-03T22:22:19  <janzert> copy pasted
2011-03-03T22:22:31  <Frontier> i guess if all browsers consistently use applet that should make me happy :)
2011-03-03T22:22:59  <janzert> and above the script button it says applet tag and to the right it says empty
