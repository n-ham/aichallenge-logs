2011-07-17T07:03:58  <mcstar> i guess i need to fiddle with engine.py, but id welcome some input

2011-07-17T07:19:29  <sigh> mcstar: I suppose you could set --turntime and --loadtime to really high values?
2011-07-17T07:20:02  <mcstar> i hoped for a more elegant solution
2011-07-17T07:20:08  <sigh> patch the engine so that it doesn't check time if they are set to 0 :P
2011-07-17T07:20:31  <mcstar> the thing is, that im using lisp, and you know, you can debug a running lisp instance, and this is what id like too
2011-07-17T07:20:49  <mcstar> but i cant debug if the engine kills the bot, which entered into debugging mode
2011-07-17T07:21:13  <mcstar> and id like to leave my bot in debugging mode as long as id like
2011-07-17T07:21:26  <mcstar> im looking into sanbox.py right now
2011-07-17T07:21:33  <sigh> line 331 in worker/engine.py if you want to change the source
2011-07-17T07:23:00  <mcstar> so the engine loops get_moves all the time, while it gasnt hit the timelimit
2011-07-17T07:23:07  <mcstar> hasnt
2011-07-17T07:23:11  <sigh> yup
2011-07-17T07:23:27  <mcstar> im wondering if this would solve the problem
2011-07-17T07:23:34  <mcstar> i mean, there can be other time checks too
2011-07-17T07:23:42  <sigh> there aren't
2011-07-17T07:23:48  <mcstar> ah ok :)
2011-07-17T07:23:57  <mcstar> i believe you
2011-07-17T07:24:04  <mcstar> thx then
2011-07-17T07:25:09  <mcstar> sigh: so if i have a question regarding the engine, and mcleo isnt here, shall i ask directly you?
2011-07-17T07:25:55  <sigh> sure, ask me, but I haven't worked on the engine since about april so my knowledge might be out of date
2011-07-17T07:28:15  <sigh> git blame still blames me for that line I pointed you at so I feel fairly safe telling you that it will fix your problem :P
2011-07-17T07:28:33  <mcstar> now, i only have to use netcat to glue the running emacs lisp instance to playgame.py :S
2011-07-17T07:28:48  <mcstar> sigh: i dont know what you mean sorry
2011-07-17T07:28:55  <mcstar> git blame? what is that?
2011-07-17T07:29:43  <sigh> git blame is a command which tells you who made the last change to each line in a file
2011-07-17T07:30:12  <mcstar> ah
2011-07-17T07:30:19  <mcstar> clear now :)
2011-07-17T07:30:26  <sigh> :)
2011-07-17T07:31:45  <mcstar> nice, cat holds the engine from advancing

2011-07-17T12:26:02  <jmcarthur> so you mean something like  let p = ... in if p then f p else g p  ?
2011-07-17T12:26:27  <mcstar> exactly
2011-07-17T12:26:31  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-17T12:26:43  <jmcarthur> let's see...
2011-07-17T12:26:58  <jmcarthur> liftA3 bool id
2011-07-17T12:27:53  <jmcarthur> say i define foo to be that, then i can say    foo applyToPWhenTrue applyToPWhenFalse p
2011-07-17T12:28:06  <jmcarthur> assuming bool is predefined (which it usually is, for me)
2011-07-17T12:28:31  <jmcarthur> bool being like if but being an actual function instead of stupid syntax sugar and having the conditional as the last argument, which is nice for point free code
2011-07-17T12:29:10  <jmcarthur> ah poop i did that wrong if bool has p as the last argument
2011-07-17T12:29:36  <jmcarthur> oh well, that's roughly what i would probably do if i was defining a handy combinator
2011-07-17T12:29:52  <jmcarthur> although... i'm not sure why i would need p in the branches
2011-07-17T12:30:11  <jmcarthur> usually when i evaluate a boolean i only need it once
2011-07-17T12:30:15  <mcstar> hm, i need a moment
2011-07-17T12:30:38  <mcstar> define foo to be :liftA3 bool id ?
2011-07-17T12:30:43  <mcstar> what does this mean?
2011-07-17T12:30:47  <jmcarthur> well, let me be more precise here
2011-07-17T12:30:56  <mcstar> are those all functions?
2011-07-17T12:31:00  <jmcarthur> bool :: a -> a -> Bool -> a
2011-07-17T12:31:05  <mcstar> is it like f o g o h ?
2011-07-17T12:32:28  <jmcarthur> foo f g = (join . liftA2) (bool f g)
2011-07-17T12:32:42  <jmcarthur> and then i can say   foo f g p
2011-07-17T12:33:00  <jmcarthur> foo :: (Bool -> a) -> (Bool -> a) -> Bool -> a
2011-07-17T12:33:01  <mcstar> so foo returns a function
2011-07-17T12:33:05  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-07-17T12:33:09  <jmcarthur> well
2011-07-17T12:33:26  <jmcarthur> in haskell, any function of multiple arguments is the same thing as a function that takes one argument and returns a function
2011-07-17T12:33:42  <jmcarthur> the above definition is also the same as:
2011-07-17T12:33:49  <jmcarthur> foo f g p = (join . liftA2) (bool f g) p
2011-07-17T12:34:08  <jmcarthur> of course if i do it that way there is no point in using those combinators
2011-07-17T12:34:13  <jmcarthur> so it's the same as:
2011-07-17T12:34:21  <jmcarthur> foo f g p = bool (f p) (g p) p
2011-07-17T12:34:33  <mcstar> i forgot the precise name of this...
2011-07-17T12:34:51  <jmcarthur> the conversion from the one without p to the one with p is called eta expansion
2011-07-17T12:35:33  <jmcarthur> the conversion from the last version to the first version would be called "making it point free"
2011-07-17T12:35:41  <jmcarthur> well, not completely point free
2011-07-17T12:35:46  <mcstar> currying
2011-07-17T12:35:54  <jmcarthur> but point free at least in that we are eliminating the binding to p
2011-07-17T12:36:43  <jmcarthur> currying is converting a function that take a tuple (all arguments at once) to a function that takes one argument at a time, returning intermediate functions
2011-07-17T12:36:55  <jmcarthur> the uncurried version of foo might look like this:
2011-07-17T12:37:03  <jmcarthur> foo (f, g, p) = bool (f p) (g p) p
2011-07-17T12:37:52  <mcstar> well, these things doesnt really apply to lisp
2011-07-17T12:37:56  <mcstar> it would be too cumbersome
2011-07-17T12:37:57  <jmcarthur> sure they do
2011-07-17T12:38:00  <jmcarthur> well yeah
2011-07-17T12:38:02  <mcstar> no, let me tell you
2011-07-17T12:38:04  <jmcarthur> but it's doable in lisp
2011-07-17T12:38:16  <jmcarthur> not necessarily recommended :)
2011-07-17T12:38:17  <mcstar> you'd need funcall and all that uglyness
2011-07-17T12:38:25  <jmcarthur> can just use lambda?
2011-07-17T12:38:28  <jmcarthur> *can't
2011-07-17T12:38:36  <jmcarthur> i don't know what funcall is
2011-07-17T12:39:06  <mcstar> funcall is for calling a function, if it resides in a symbol's function-cell
2011-07-17T12:39:30  <jmcarthur> that just goes over my head :\
2011-07-17T12:39:46  <jmcarthur> what is "a symbol's function call"?
2011-07-17T12:39:51  <mcstar> cell
2011-07-17T12:39:56  <jmcarthur> cell
2011-07-17T12:40:35  <mcstar> a symbol can be made bound to a value, and a function value at the same time
2011-07-17T12:40:44  <jmcarthur> o_O
2011-07-17T12:40:55  <jmcarthur> so functions are not treated as values?
2011-07-17T12:41:08  <mcstar> they are function-values
2011-07-17T12:41:11  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-17T12:41:16  *** jbrechtel <jbrechtel!~jbrechtel@64.134.184.98> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-17T12:41:32  <mcstar> i can say in lisp: (list list), which will print (3)
2011-07-17T12:41:35  <mcstar> for example
2011-07-17T12:41:53  <jmcarthur> assuming some definition of list i assume...
2011-07-17T12:42:17  <mcstar> yes, (symbol-value 'list) => 3
2011-07-17T12:42:40  <mcstar> (symbol-function 'list) => #built-in function......
2011-07-17T12:43:32  <mcstar> actually symbols have a property list, they can have many things associated with, like a table
2011-07-17T12:43:37  <jmcarthur> so a symbol is really some sort of a key-value store then? used one way it gives one thing and used another way it gives another?
2011-07-17T12:43:41  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-17T12:44:39  <mcstar> but in scheme this isnt so
2011-07-17T12:44:54  <mcstar> a symbol effectively has 1 thing associated with
2011-07-17T12:44:58  <jmcarthur> i am more used to the scheme way
2011-07-17T12:46:51  <mcstar> what my if* actually does, is this: (let ((tempvar (test-function))) (if tempvar (function-to-call-if-true tempvar) (f-to-call-if-false)))
2011-07-17T12:47:02  <mcstar> its like your first suggestion
2011-07-17T12:47:09  <mcstar> is that real haskell btw?
2011-07-17T12:47:21  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-07-17T12:47:22  <mcstar> let p = ... in if p then f p else g p
2011-07-17T12:47:44  <mcstar> if p then f p else g p where p = something
2011-07-17T12:47:48  <mcstar> is this ok?
2011-07-17T12:47:54  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-07-17T12:48:12  <mcstar> so what is the difference between let and where?
2011-07-17T12:48:13  <jmcarthur> where and let have difference scoping rules sometimes
2011-07-17T12:48:18  <jmcarthur> *different
2011-07-17T12:49:14  <jmcarthur> let ... in ... forms an expression
2011-07-17T12:49:32  <jmcarthur> where is attached to a syntactic construct and doesn't create a value itself
2011-07-17T12:50:01  <mcstar> hm
2011-07-17T12:50:01  <jmcarthur> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Let_vs._Where
2011-07-17T12:50:11  <jmcarthur> heh, even the same wording i just used
2011-07-17T12:50:17  <mcstar> but the something after where isnt evaluated multiple times, right?
2011-07-17T12:50:38  <mcstar> so there it must store the value
2011-07-17T12:50:43  <jmcarthur> no, it's shared if used multiple times in the syntactic construct it is bound to
2011-07-17T12:50:45  <mcstar> -there
2011-07-17T12:51:54  <jmcarthur> but the point is that "foo = ... where bar = ..." doesn't have a value. it's just creating a value called foo. however, "let bar = ... in ..." is itself an expression that can be nested inside other expressions
2011-07-17T12:53:06  <jmcarthur> actually, "... where bar = ..." might be an expression
2011-07-17T12:53:11  <jmcarthur> i never use where that way though

2011-07-17T12:54:07  <mcstar> im not capable of parsing haskell today
2011-07-17T12:54:27  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-07-17T12:54:38  <mcstar> this will just confuse me, untill i read some tutorials
2011-07-17T12:54:43  <mcstar> which isnt gonna happen soon
2011-07-17T12:54:47  <jmcarthur> that code isn't very idiomatic anyway
2011-07-17T12:54:52  <jmcarthur> on the wiki page
2011-07-17T12:55:04  <mcstar> im reading the page you linked
2011-07-17T12:55:06  <jmcarthur> or it's complicated by the elipsis
2011-07-17T12:55:07  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-07-17T12:55:57  <mcstar> what i really liked in lisp, is that the code is soo homogene
2011-07-17T12:55:59  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-17T12:56:04  <mcstar> homogenous
2011-07-17T12:56:07  <mcstar> sry
2011-07-17T12:56:11  <jmcarthur> homogeneous
2011-07-17T12:56:16  <mcstar> yep
2011-07-17T12:56:18  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-17T12:56:30  <mcstar> we say homogén
2011-07-17T12:57:08  <jmcarthur> haskell syntax is actually quite homogeneous too, aside from some (stupid) things like if-then-else
2011-07-17T12:57:19  <jmcarthur> not as homogeneous as lisp by any stretch
2011-07-17T12:57:49  <jmcarthur> but function application is pretty homogeneous aside from infix functions (which you can use as prefix functions anyway)
2011-07-17T12:58:08  <jmcarthur> let/where breaks that a bit, but that's just because haskell is not a macro language
2011-07-17T12:58:38  <jmcarthur> when you write haskell, you're not making an AST. you're making a mathematical expression.
2011-07-17T12:59:07  <jmcarthur> at least conceptually, that's the way i approach it differently that i would something like lisp
2011-07-17T12:59:14  <jmcarthur> *than
2011-07-17T12:59:42  <mcstar> AST?
2011-07-17T13:00:27  <mcstar> have you used logic programming languages? like prolog? i wonder if somebody will use that
2011-07-17T13:00:38  <mcstar> id sure take a look at it
2011-07-17T13:01:19  <mcstar> yesterday i was browsing the wiki looking for those, but there arent many
2011-07-17T13:02:21  <jmcarthur> i've done a fair bit of research into logic programming languages
2011-07-17T13:02:40  <jmcarthur> at a high level, logic programming is like a utopia of programming
2011-07-17T13:03:07  <jmcarthur> in that it's great for making specifications, and it would be great if specifications were enough to make working, efficient code
2011-07-17T13:03:22  <mcstar> yeah, but you are in the dark as to how much resources your computation will take up
2011-07-17T13:03:47  <jmcarthur> the problem is mainly that of (either) efficiency or understanding/controlling *whether* your program will be efficient
2011-07-17T13:04:36  <jmcarthur> IMO, an ideal would be to write your code in a logic programming language (not really like prolog, but maybe something like it), and then *derive* a functional program from it with the assistance of automated tools
2011-07-17T13:04:58  <jmcarthur> basically deriving a program from a specification, but with predictable and controllable resource usage
2011-07-17T13:05:12  <jmcarthur> and with a compiler-checked proof that the derivation is correct
2011-07-17T13:05:44  <mcstar> yeah, you'd be better of inventing human level AI first, and then forgetting about the whole thing :D
2011-07-17T13:05:50  <mcstar> off*
2011-07-17T13:05:55  <jmcarthur> hm?
2011-07-17T13:06:00  <jmcarthur> what i propose is quite doable
2011-07-17T13:06:16  <mcstar> it is quite hard i imagine
2011-07-17T13:06:29  <jmcarthur> nah, we have the technology already
2011-07-17T13:06:44  <jmcarthur> we just don't have the language(s), and the tools aren't very friendly yet
2011-07-17T13:06:50  <mcstar> there are "proofing" programs that can check other programs, but im not sure if it is applied as an every day practice
2011-07-17T13:07:09  <jmcarthur> i'm talking about proof checkers, not proof generators
2011-07-17T13:07:31  <mcstar> yeah, me too
2011-07-17T13:07:35  <jmcarthur> if you do a program derivation such that each step is trivially provable by your tools, then by the time you are done you have a full proof
2011-07-17T13:08:31  <jmcarthur> well yeah, it's not the popular thing to do right now. that's why i stated it as a (realistic) ideal rathe than as reality ;)
2011-07-17T13:08:39  <jmcarthur> *rather than
2011-07-17T13:09:25  <mcstar> and what i said(AI) means, that basically, we invent these abstractions, because we can no longer can write programs in low level languages
2011-07-17T13:09:44  <mcstar> we want to write complex software, but we can see them through in low level languages
2011-07-17T13:09:53  <mcstar> but an AI wouldnt have this kind of restriciton
2011-07-17T13:10:15  <jmcarthur> i thought you were relating the discussion to AI because you were pointing out some difficulty in what i said
2011-07-17T13:10:24  <jmcarthur> i see AI as a much much much more difficult goal
2011-07-17T13:11:02  <mcstar> im not an expert, but my opinion is that ai isnt fundamentally more difficult
2011-07-17T13:11:39  <mcstar> its just another kind of problem, where combinatoric explosion shows up
2011-07-17T13:11:50  <jmcarthur> well, we have the technology i'm talking about today, and IMO we won't have the kind of AI i think you are talking about at least several decades
2011-07-17T13:12:25  <mcstar> why do you think we dont have that ai today?
2011-07-17T13:12:49  <mcstar> i mean, maybe we only need bigger connectivity in an already existing neural simulation
2011-07-17T13:14:45  <jmcarthur> it sounds highly speculative
2011-07-17T13:16:22  <jbrechtel> mcstar: are you including fully general intelligence in your definition of AI?  Just to clarify...
2011-07-17T13:16:36  <jbrechtel> (Sorry I'm catching up)
2011-07-17T13:16:43  <mcstar> jmcarthur: do you think we need some kind of fundamental mathematical/computational discovery for AI?
2011-07-17T13:17:14  <mcstar> jbrechtel: generic, human level ai, not task specific, like in the turing sense
2011-07-17T13:17:22  <jmcarthur> mcstar: i'm uncomfortable answering that question unless i know more specifically what you are talking about
2011-07-17T13:17:27  <jmcarthur> okay human level AI
2011-07-17T13:18:32  <jmcarthur> i suspect that we lack hundreds of fundamental biological, mathematical, computational, and physical discoveries before we have a chance of reaching that point
2011-07-17T13:19:29  <jmcarthur> also, the very notion is very fuzzy and raises a lot of questions. would such an AI even be subservient?
2011-07-17T13:19:53  <jmcarthur> it's possible that it could be
2011-07-17T13:20:24  <jmcarthur> but i doubt that we are smart enough to make an AI that smart that is also going to take orders
2011-07-17T13:20:32  <mcstar> it all depends on its experience, the way it collects all that knowledge that makes us call it intelligent
2011-07-17T13:20:33  <jbrechtel> It seems to be like consciousness is required for human level general intelligence.  i.e.  to think "I'm wasting my time on this approach"  (the *I* being the important part).  Consciousness certainly isn't understood enough for us to build it yet.
2011-07-17T13:20:50  <jbrechtel> Well, I say certainly...I am presuming there...I don't know what the cutting edge research is.
2011-07-17T13:21:13  <jmcarthur> i think at least 99.9999% of people that have this conversation are being presumptious ;)
2011-07-17T13:21:27  <jbrechtel> Sure it's possible that consciousness will be an emergent property of a good enough learning engine, but that's just speculation.
2011-07-17T13:21:37  <jmcarthur> right
2011-07-17T13:21:47  <jbrechtel> Heh...I should have just dropped 'certainly' off to begin with... :)
2011-07-17T13:21:57  <jmcarthur> and if it's merely emergent, it's likely that obedience would also have to be emergent (which i find highly unlikely)
2011-07-17T13:22:07  <mcstar> my view, is that i dont think I am conscious
2011-07-17T13:22:14  <jbrechtel> Good point
2011-07-17T13:22:34  <jbrechtel> So now it's a philosphical discussion
2011-07-17T13:22:47  <mcstar> not really
2011-07-17T13:22:53  <jmcarthur> i don't think it is yet
2011-07-17T13:23:10  <mcstar> i mean if it quacks like a duck and look slike a duck its a duck(or similarly)
2011-07-17T13:23:19  <jbrechtel> Not conscious -> no free will, right?
2011-07-17T13:23:26  *** Apophis_ <Apophis_!~apophis@217-162-217-10.dynamic.hispeed.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-17T13:23:40  <mcstar> thats a really bad thing, to discuss free will
2011-07-17T13:23:47  <mcstar> its a marginal question
2011-07-17T13:23:47  <jbrechtel> Sorry I really don't mean to derail
2011-07-17T13:23:54  <jbrechtel> Perhaps you could describe what you mean by not conscious
2011-07-17T13:24:34  <jmcarthur> my opinion on the matter, summarized, is that AI of this sort will probably never be mathematically rigorous, and therefore never understood to a level to be as useful as just applying a human to a project
2011-07-17T13:24:56  <mcstar> why i say its marginal, is because there can be many deterministic models, arbitrarily complex, that you'd need extremely long time/input/calculations to say with certainty that it is actually deterministic, and you cant have sort of free will
2011-07-17T13:24:57  <jmcarthur> well
2011-07-17T13:25:04  <jmcarthur> s/as useful/more useful/
2011-07-17T13:25:14  <jmcarthur> of course a human-level AI would be as useful as any other human
2011-07-17T13:25:31  <jmcarthur> i simply doubt that it would be any *more*... reliable
2011-07-17T13:26:12  <jmcarthur> ah this discussion on free will is certainly philosophical
2011-07-17T13:26:24  <jbrechtel> sorry... :(
2011-07-17T13:26:31  <mcstar> its like discussing this problem in physics: determinism/chaod/quantum probabilities
2011-07-17T13:27:29  <mcstar> what ever the fact is, we arent by any measure restricited by it
2011-07-17T13:27:33  <mcstar> restricted
2011-07-17T13:28:07  <mcstar> so, i believe we can make human level ai, without answering the question is the ai/are we conscious?
2011-07-17T13:29:34  <jmcarthur> i agree that *if* we can make human-level (equivalent or superior in intelligence, not necessary equivalent in behavior) ai, we will not need to answer that question
2011-07-17T13:30:22  <mcstar> jmcarthur: what do you mean by "mathematically rigorous"?
2011-07-17T13:30:42  <mcstar> on a fundamental level, everything is
2011-07-17T13:31:19  <mcstar> you cant come up with an example that isnt correct under some settings
2011-07-17T13:33:09  <mcstar> let me tell you one story:
2011-07-17T13:33:34  <mcstar> yesterday, in a version of my bot i introduced an error(involuntarily)
2011-07-17T13:33:52  <mcstar> the bot supposed to be standing still, if it couldnt see any food
2011-07-17T13:34:07  <mcstar> but instead, it made some adjustment to its shape(its a snake-bot)
2011-07-17T13:34:47  <mcstar> until i figured out, what exactly the bug was, can i assume, that the bot simply is intelligent?
2011-07-17T13:35:15  <mcstar> it does something, that i didnt want it to, and if i look hard enough, maybe i can superficially give some reason for it
2011-07-17T13:36:01  <mcstar> all in all, im inclined to think, that these "full-brain" simulations will eventually succeed
2011-07-17T13:36:41  <mcstar> if one can simulate the whole brain on a fine-enough scale, a system capable of showing intelligent behaviour will emerge
2011-07-17T13:37:10  <mcstar> (given right training is present, and the output is interpreted correctly9
2011-07-17T13:37:11  <mcstar> )
2011-07-17T13:37:52  <jmcarthur> by mathematically rigorous i basically mean fully understood and intentional
2011-07-17T13:38:03  <jbrechtel> I'm inclined to say that since it's fixed behavior, even though not what you expect, that it doesn't sound like it would pass for intelligence.  But your response would be that it's likely all our behavior is really 'fixed', it's just more complicated chains of inputs and outputs
2011-07-17T13:38:23  <jbrechtel> oops, meant to end that with ?
2011-07-17T13:39:03  <mcstar> jbrechtel: i think this is like deciding if something is really random
2011-07-17T13:39:07  <jbrechtel> yes
2011-07-17T13:39:25  <mcstar> so, youre correct, id say that
2011-07-17T13:39:54  <mcstar> i mean you correctly assumed that id say what you thought id say :D
2011-07-17T13:40:56  <mcstar> jmcarthur: the only problem with that, is that even mathematics isnt rigorous by your definition then
2011-07-17T13:41:28  <mcstar> take the simple axioms of integers
2011-07-17T13:42:16  <mcstar> im not sure when did they write them down explicitely, but the research it spawned is still growing(fast!), so you cant say, that it was intentional
2011-07-17T13:42:30  <mcstar> or fully comprehended when the decided on those axioms

2011-07-17T13:43:39  <mcstar> btw, if you look hard enough, you can find all the answers to any intelligent question, encoded in the digits of Pi
2011-07-17T13:43:52  <mcstar> (in fact, to every question)
2011-07-17T13:43:56  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-17T13:44:00  <mcstar> this sucks
2011-07-17T13:44:22  <mcstar> i can see why Cantor went whoo-hoo when the contemplated the many infinities
2011-07-17T13:59:09  <mcstar> oh, and another thing that i'd like to share, since we were talking about these kind of things, is what really sets up apart from algorithms/computers, is our special, and sensory environment we live in
2011-07-17T13:59:48  <mcstar> we get an immense amount of input every second
2011-07-17T14:00:13  <mcstar> and we live in a society, and in a universe with physical rules, we need to obey, to keep living
2011-07-17T14:00:25  <mcstar> keep on*
2011-07-17T14:01:24  <mcstar> if we really want a kind of AI, that behaves like us, i think it would need to live in a similar environment like us, it wont just float in the void of the computer
2011-07-17T14:02:00  <mcstar> this is getting very sci-fi like, and since i dont get any response ill stfu

2011-07-17T14:50:55  <jmcarthur> mcstar: i disagree. everything we know about the integers was derived from simple axioms that we fully understand. it's only the consequences that we don't understand. however, the nice thing about these unpredictable consequences is that when we think of it it is usually possible to prove or disprove them
2011-07-17T15:01:08  <jmcarthur> the point is that rigor usually emphasizes simplicity and precision

2011-07-17T15:02:55  <mcstar> i disagree then on the meaning of "to understand", for me, to understand something, is that i understand the consequence of another thing. i wouldnt say that we usually understand axioms. we have them. we can write them dow. but i dont think we understand all of them(except really simple ones)
2011-07-17T15:03:43  <jmcarthur> axioms by definition allow you to understand the consequence of combining one thing with another thing
2011-07-17T15:03:54  <jmcarthur> *consequences
2011-07-17T15:04:05  <jmcarthur> or to understand the relationship between one thing and another
2011-07-17T15:04:47  <mcstar> yes, but the meaning of an axiom, is not its written form, or whatever, but the possible forms, that it can lead to
2011-07-17T15:05:03  <jmcarthur> i agree that an axiomatic understanding is not a full understanding, but that only further drives home my point, since in maths there are other ways to characterize a formal system too, and i don't even know how to apply those semantics to "AI"
2011-07-17T15:05:12  <mcstar> a system of axioms is like a compression, so to speak
2011-07-17T15:07:09  <jmcarthur> how about denotational semantics then? how would one denote a "human-level" AI?
2011-07-17T15:07:26  <jmcarthur> this would be some other form of "understanding"
2011-07-17T15:07:46  <jmcarthur> in this case, it would be a better understanding of composition than axioms alone
2011-07-17T15:07:49  <mcstar> first id need to know what "denotational semantics" means
2011-07-17T15:08:05  *** jmreardon <jmreardon!~jmreardon@129-97-120-191.uwaterloo.ca> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-17T15:08:12  <jmcarthur> a denotation is a meaning, where that meaning is some mathematical object
2011-07-17T15:08:30  <jmcarthur> and the object is defined by a well-understood formal system
2011-07-17T15:08:59  <jmcarthur> everything that applies to the denotation must also apply to the AI
2011-07-17T15:10:31  * mcstar , the AI that you were talking to blowed a fuse, and since then, is no longer operational
2011-07-17T15:11:00  <jmcarthur> heh, that's makes it even harder because you are trying to mathematically characterize a physical universe that we definitely do not understand
2011-07-17T15:11:03  <jmcarthur> *that
2011-07-17T15:11:23  <jmcarthur> i'm fine with making the task "easier" by limiting ourselves to the software only
2011-07-17T15:11:47  <mcstar> are you reaqding my previous comments?
2011-07-17T15:13:04  <jmcarthur> sorry i did not notice your comments about physical rules
2011-07-17T15:13:28  <mcstar> so far, it turned out, that every time our understanding of physics expands, we still can find a mathematical framework that it fits
2011-07-17T15:13:29  <jmcarthur> i think we are far off the original track here
2011-07-17T15:13:45  <mcstar> another thing is, that we can compute the exact values of basically anything
2011-07-17T15:13:56  <mcstar> we cant*
2011-07-17T15:14:26  <mcstar> jmcarthur: was there an original track? i thought we were just talking ....
2011-07-17T15:14:28  <jmcarthur> i was under the impression that your suggestion was that we'd have an easier time making an AI that can do certified programming for us than we would creating formally provable software
2011-07-17T15:14:59  <jmcarthur> so my focus has been on that angle, that because we can't understand the AI itself then we can't declare the program certified in any meaningful way
2011-07-17T15:17:00  <mcstar> look, i can write up some specifications, if those criteria are met, then we say, the program is certified, i then tell the monkey to change the bits randomly, if i give enough time for the monkey, which effectively behaves unintelligently, he might succeed in making a certified program
2011-07-17T15:17:34  <jmcarthur> but you can't take a monkey (even a super intelligent one), ask for a certified program, and expect one
2011-07-17T15:18:40  <jmcarthur> just because a sequence of random bits might contain a program that meets your spec doesn't mean you will ever get the right subsequence of random bits
2011-07-17T15:19:04  <jmcarthur> and even just pulling some subsequence from it you don't know that that is what you wanted
2011-07-17T15:19:08  <jmcarthur> you need the proof along with it
2011-07-17T15:19:15  <jmcarthur> and you need to manually verify it
2011-07-17T15:19:44  <jmcarthur> anyway, i have to go
2011-07-17T15:19:47  <mcstar> i guess verifying it can be done more easily than to come up with
2011-07-17T15:19:51  <mcstar> yeah
2011-07-17T15:19:51  <jmcarthur> yes

2011-07-17T22:18:34  <Qua> Can anyone give me a quick pointer as to how I can submit a fix to the code base?
2011-07-17T22:31:37  <jmcarthur> Qua: have you used github before?
2011-07-17T22:31:46  <jmcarthur> err, i mean contributed to a project on github?
2011-07-17T22:32:09  <Qua> Nope, but I'm used to the concept of source control
2011-07-17T22:32:17  <jmcarthur> Qua: the ideal way is to fork the project on github (there's a button for it, make your change and push to the fork, then do a pull request
2011-07-17T22:32:25  <jmcarthur> *it)
2011-07-17T22:32:50  <Qua> Alright, so I branch the original project, make changes, comit changes and then request a merge ?
2011-07-17T22:33:04  <Qua> Sorry about the terminology. Just want to make sure I get it right :)
2011-07-17T22:33:10  <jmcarthur> well, with git you not only have to commit but you have to push too
2011-07-17T22:33:25  <jmcarthur> commits are local, then you push the commits to the remote repo on github
2011-07-17T22:33:30  <Qua> Ahh
2011-07-17T22:33:49  <Qua> I can get started right away then :)
2011-07-17T22:34:20  <jmcarthur> so, more explicitly:   fork the repo on github, clone from your fork, make your changes, commit your changes, push to your fork, then do a pull request on github
2011-07-17T22:35:13  <jmcarthur> and in the pull request you should be able to explain what you did and why it's beneficial
2011-07-17T22:35:26  <jmcarthur> maybe say it fixes a bug in the issue tracker, if it does
2011-07-17T22:35:27  <Qua> Thank you

2011-07-17T23:47:45  <Qua> if i add the bot twice i get this
2011-07-17T23:48:00  <amstan> ./testbot.py path/to/MyBot.exe
2011-07-17T23:48:39  *** amstan_ <amstan_!~alex@69-196-151-239.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-07-17T23:49:29  <Qua> Uploaded the starter package online and still get turn 0 timeout
2011-07-17T23:49:30  <Qua> 18	2011-07-18 07:42:07	Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases	-			 C# turn    0 bot 0 timed out
2011-07-17T23:50:01  <amstan> Qua: i got that it doesn't work in the tournament, now what is the output of test_bot.py locally
2011-07-17T23:50:14  <amstan> of the starter package preferrably
2011-07-17T23:50:56  <Qua> same as yours
2011-07-17T23:50:58  <Qua> more or less
2011-07-17T23:51:11  <amstan> is that a win or a fail?
2011-07-17T23:51:24  <Qua> no fail
2011-07-17T23:51:40  <Qua> status eliminated survived
2011-07-17T23:51:46  <amstan> ok, that's all i wanted
2011-07-17T23:52:30  <amstan> wait..
2011-07-17T23:52:32  <amstan> no
2011-07-17T23:52:41  <amstan> the first player is the bot to be tested
2011-07-17T23:52:44  <amstan> if it was eliminated
2011-07-17T23:52:50  <amstan> then it means it failed the test
2011-07-17T23:52:56  <amstan> ./playgame.py --engine_seed 42 --player_seed 42 --food none --end_wait=0.25 --verbose --log_dir game_logs --turns 30 --map_file submission_test/test.map "$1" "python submission_test/TestBot.py" --nolaunch -e --strict --capture_errors
2011-07-17T23:53:05  <amstan> notice how $1 is before testbot
2011-07-17T23:54:12  <amstan> Qua: we did change the game logistics recently, maybe that caused it
2011-07-17T23:55:01  <Qua> Nope, even a blank bot just replying with 'go' everytime it is supposed to do something fails
2011-07-17T23:55:24  <amstan> maybe it gets owned by the test bot or something
2011-07-17T23:55:26  <amstan> look at the game
2011-07-17T23:55:30  <amstan> replay*
2011-07-17T23:58:29  <bhasker> evening
2011-07-17T23:58:30  <Qua> So, to pass the upload test you have to beat the test bot?
