2011-07-22T15:30:02  <mcstar> this 500ms turn timelimit it utterly ridiculous
2011-07-22T15:31:13  <mcstar> why dont you just say: you can only use array manipulator languages, and c derivatives, and forbid all really high level languages
2011-07-22T15:31:43  <jbroman> mcstar: Because that takes too long to say.
2011-07-22T15:31:45  <jbroman> (I kid.)
2011-07-22T15:31:58  <mcstar> and i kid you not
2011-07-22T15:32:14  <bhasker> mcstar what language are you using to write?
2011-07-22T15:32:19  <mcstar> lisp
2011-07-22T15:32:37  <bhasker> ah
2011-07-22T15:32:40  <mcstar> i havent really hit the timelimit, but im sure that i will hit the 500ms limit soon
2011-07-22T15:32:54  <bhasker> well if anything last contest was the same turn limit and the winning bot was in lisp:)
2011-07-22T15:33:04  <mcstar> and theres no point in allowing any language if you dont give them time to run
2011-07-22T15:33:39  <mcstar> the point is: theres no point in using a high level language if you have to do everything in imperative style
2011-07-22T15:34:00  <mcstar> i can my lisp code as fast as c, but then the code will look like c (mostly)
2011-07-22T15:34:05  <mcstar> can make*
2011-07-22T15:34:14  <antimatroid> ants requires more time to work out moves than pw did
2011-07-22T15:34:16  <antimatroid> at least imo
2011-07-22T15:34:37  <bhasker> hmm maybe a little more
2011-07-22T15:34:39  <antimatroid> a lot of the top bots were still barely using any time at the end of pw, it's really easy to use your time up with ants
2011-07-22T15:34:40  <bhasker> but then in ants
2011-07-22T15:34:46  <bhasker> you don't have to see 10 steps ahead
2011-07-22T15:35:02  <bhasker> since you can move back next turn
2011-07-22T15:35:07  <mcstar> yo have to plan then replan then replan
2011-07-22T15:35:07  <bhasker> planetwars once you sent a fleet
2011-07-22T15:35:13  <bhasker> its gone
2011-07-22T15:35:16  <bhasker> for X turns
2011-07-22T15:35:21  <mcstar> at least if you dont want to use 2d maps all the time
2011-07-22T15:35:31  <bhasker> my current bot is barely hitting like 200ms per turn
2011-07-22T15:35:39  <mcstar> i like to think in "entities" rather than pixels
2011-07-22T15:36:16  <antimatroid> my food collection alone can use 200+ on a turn
2011-07-22T15:36:23  <antimatroid> but i am too busy to spent more time on the bot
2011-07-22T15:36:25  <bhasker> ouch thats a lot antimatroid
2011-07-22T15:36:41  <mcstar> bhasker: he collects food the very best way :D
2011-07-22T15:36:48  <bhasker> it usually takes me under 0.3-0.4 ms per ant
2011-07-22T15:36:50  <bhasker> i guess so
2011-07-22T15:37:43  <mcstar> antimatroid: you silly cross-dresser
2011-07-22T15:37:50  <antimatroid> :P
2011-07-22T15:38:55  <bhasker> my latest bot actually does a decent job with food collection not the most optimal but decent
2011-07-22T15:39:01  <bhasker> have to fix a few more things in there
2011-07-22T15:39:34  <antimatroid> mine is far from optimal
2011-07-22T15:39:37  <antimatroid> but it's pretty good
2011-07-22T15:39:46  <antimatroid> you'd need game trees to make it optimal i think
2011-07-22T15:39:55  <antimatroid> and even then it's a game, optimal is fuzzy

2011-07-22T15:42:35  <mcstar> theres only .2
2011-07-22T15:42:48  <bhasker> hbhasker was created but the confirmation link was never clicked
2011-07-22T15:42:51  <mcstar> was it always called hbhasker2?
2011-07-22T15:42:55  <bhasker> so the account is in limbo
2011-07-22T15:42:58  <mcstar> oh
2011-07-22T15:43:15  <bhasker> so hbhasker can't be claimed without someone deleting the entry from the db
2011-07-22T15:43:16  <mcstar> i booked another account for myself
2011-07-22T15:43:42  <mcstar> when my bot will be decent(tomorrow? on the weekend?) ill upload to that
2011-07-22T15:43:43  <bhasker> i will probably compete with the name i called my previous bot
2011-07-22T15:43:57  <mcstar> what was that?
2011-07-22T15:43:58  <bhasker> if this contest ever goes live i.e
2011-07-22T15:44:02  <mcstar> hehe
2011-07-22T15:44:22  <bhasker> well last contest i competed as 'bhasker' but the bot was mostly called 'malazan' on the tcp server
2011-07-22T15:44:52  <mcstar> where do you get such names...
2011-07-22T15:45:17  <mcstar> youre american right?
2011-07-22T15:45:20  <bhasker> no:)
2011-07-22T15:45:23  <bhasker> indian :)
2011-07-22T15:45:27  <mcstar> ok

2011-07-22T15:46:00  <bhasker> as for bhasker thats my real name:)
2011-07-22T15:46:18  <mcstar> is it b. hasker?
2011-07-22T15:46:35  <bhasker> nope one word
2011-07-22T15:46:37  <bhasker> bhasker*
2011-07-22T15:46:41  <bhasker> h is my initial
2011-07-22T15:46:42  <bhasker> normally
2011-07-22T15:46:46  <mcstar> ok :)

2011-07-22T15:47:03  <bhasker> bhasker in hindi/tamil usually refers to the sun
2011-07-22T15:47:09  <bhasker> sun god rather*
