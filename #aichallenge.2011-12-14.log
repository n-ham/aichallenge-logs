2011-12-14T00:04:13  <thestinger> all my improvements came from bugfixes
2011-12-14T00:04:18  <thestinger> which then added more bugs I had to fix
2011-12-14T00:04:37  <thestinger> and some of those bugs were good, so I kept them and turned them into features
2011-12-14T00:05:20  <thestinger> I understand each bit of code by itself, but some of the stuff my bot does I can't comprehend
2011-12-14T00:05:48  <thestinger> like my food search code is somehow a _huge_ factor in combat
2011-12-14T00:06:21  <thestinger> if I tweak it, my bot no longer retreats, etc.

2011-12-14T00:33:47  <antimatroid1> Antimony: what do you mean?
2011-12-14T00:34:35  <Antimony> "The entire map is divided into sets of squares that are symmetric. The sets are shuffled into a random order. When food is spawned, the next set is chosen. When all the sets have been chosen, they are shuffled again."
2011-12-14T00:34:51  <antimatroid1> oh, yes it should be possible
2011-12-14T00:34:57  <antimatroid1> but i doubt the spawn rate is set high enough
2011-12-14T00:35:08  <antimatroid1> you are aware of what happens when an ant resides on a spawn location right?
2011-12-14T00:35:23  <antimatroid1> the food queues up and waits to spawn there the next turn an ant doesn't reside there
2011-12-14T00:35:29  <antimatroid1> so statit ants == bad

2011-12-14T00:50:53  <Antimony> ug, how long do these games take?
2011-12-14T00:51:26  <Antimony> my bot has been "playing a game" for like 40 minutes on the server
2011-12-14T00:51:42  <janzert> it might be hours
2011-12-14T00:51:49  <janzert> it probably isn't really in a game
2011-12-14T00:53:02  <janzert> the profile page thinks you're in a game when a matchup has been created, but a whole bunch of pairings got pre-created by accident (because of the bug fixed in that last checkin)
2011-12-14T00:53:37  <janzert> actually it should be about an hour for all the excess matches to clear out
2011-12-14T00:53:48  <Antimony> oh
2011-12-14T00:55:36  <antimatroid1> thestinger: did you ever do anything about moving dying ants out in battle?
2011-12-14T00:57:38  <thestinger> not really, I haven't really touched my code for a while
2011-12-14T00:57:42  <thestinger> I've just merged some stuff
2011-12-14T00:58:00  <thestinger> I might make one final improvement to combat so that my bot actually uses up all the turntime trying stuff
2011-12-14T00:58:07  <antimatroid1> i might just add a bunch more sets of heuristically chosen moves into my tree
2011-12-14T00:58:12  <antimatroid1> it's too messy to do the former

2011-12-14T01:13:50  <AntDroid> I've found it on ants.py line 23
2011-12-14T01:14:58  <BenJackson> from the map format
2011-12-14T01:15:03  <BenJackson> A is 0's hill etc
2011-12-14T01:15:06  <bqf> AntDroid: it's the syntax for maps. since those are plaintext with one character per tile, there is no way to say "there is a hill AND an ant on this tile" other than using a different symbol.
2011-12-14T01:15:39  <BenJackson> 21:31 < Antimony> does anyone know if it's possible for multiple sets of food tiles to spawn on a single turn?
2011-12-14T01:15:51  <BenJackson> Antimony: interesting question ;-)
2011-12-14T01:16:18  <BenJackson> so on the one hand I'm pleased to win 8 games in a row
2011-12-14T01:16:35  <BenJackson> on the other hand I could have done with matchups that would have counted for more than 639th!

2011-12-14T01:17:39  <AntDroid> bqf: thanks. my current bot doesnt recognize hills when there is an ant over it. there are lots of games where it abandoned attacking the hill as the enemy ant covered it.
2011-12-14T01:17:52  <BenJackson> AntDroid: the server does *send* those
2011-12-14T01:18:23  <bqf> *doesn't
2011-12-14T01:18:47  <bqf> oh, sorry. you meant "it send a hill AND an ant info", not "it send the uppercase letters". carry on then.
2011-12-14T01:19:05  <BenJackson> yeah there might be a starter package out there that "loses" that info
2011-12-14T01:19:10  <bqf> why both those "send" are missing an "s", i will never know.
2011-12-14T01:19:14  <BenJackson> since I've seen comments about ants "covering" hills
2011-12-14T01:20:21  <AntDroid> BenJackson: i'm confused. so it is not sending the Capital letters instead a separate input like "h 1 1 0" and "a 1 1 0"
2011-12-14T01:21:18  <AntDroid> i've used the C starter package by the way and it has no hills support
2011-12-14T01:21:38  <bqf> AntDroid: yes. as i said, the capital letters are from the map format - you don't need to care about that unless you want to create scenarios for your bot or work on the map generators.
2011-12-14T01:21:39  <BenJackson> right, it sends h 1 1 0 and a 1 1 0
2011-12-14T01:23:22  <AntDroid> okay. thanks guys. need to fix this bug. my bot assumed the hill is razed because the enemy ant covered it.

2011-12-14T01:35:40  <AntDroid> janzert: problem is that my map overwrites the hill with ant, so when i loop over the map the hill can't be seen. the C starter package by FlagCapper which I'm using has 2 levels of initialization. one is for the map table and one is for game data.
2011-12-14T01:36:34  <AntDroid> the hill is overwritten at the first initialization

2011-12-14T01:55:40  <antimatroid1> so i've finally watched a few xathis games
2011-12-14T01:55:43  <antimatroid1> what makes his bot so good?
2011-12-14T01:55:51  <antimatroid1> there's nothing particularly amazing about his battle code
2011-12-14T01:56:39  <antimatroid1> he must be controlling/exploring the map better than everyone?
2011-12-14T01:58:36  <_flag> antimatroid1: His battle code is the best I've seen so far actually
2011-12-14T01:58:48  <_flag> Because it focuses on controlling space very well and not giving up any area
2011-12-14T01:58:59  <_flag> It's simple but effective
2011-12-14T01:59:07  <_flag> And yes, he does explore well, but he did that before
2011-12-14T01:59:17  <_flag> The change in battle code seems to be the most major improvement
2011-12-14T02:02:37  <antimatroid1> hmmm okay
2011-12-14T02:02:41  <antimatroid1> i'll take your word for it
2011-12-14T02:02:48  <antimatroid1> i am pretty happy with my battle code
2011-12-14T02:02:53  <antimatroid1> i just need to get the rest working alright
2011-12-14T02:07:57  <BenJackson> I didn't really watch his battles that closely
2011-12-14T02:08:05  <BenJackson> I think his main strength is the efficiency of his ant usage
2011-12-14T02:08:10  <BenJackson> and the timely delivery where they're needed
2011-12-14T02:09:21  <janzert> the secret to a strong bot is having no weaknesses ;)
2011-12-14T02:11:08  <BenJackson> haha I reloaded my profile because it had said "in a game"
2011-12-14T02:11:15  <BenJackson> my rank went from 640 to 639 in the reload
2011-12-14T02:11:16  <_flag> janzert: I know that replacing bots directly into their spot in the rankings was removed because some people go to used to playing only top bots, so I was wondering (earlier on irc) if maybe there should instead be an optional reset feature?
2011-12-14T02:11:23  <BenJackson> I was really wondering wtf
2011-12-14T02:11:26  <BenJackson> but of course it was nothing
2011-12-14T02:11:50  <BenJackson> janzert: or an optional "please seed me against skill=n"
2011-12-14T02:12:17  <BenJackson> this round has been particularly slow for me because even my 6th game was against ~1000 ranked players
2011-12-14T02:12:30  <_flag> BenJackson: Well, then everyone would want to be seeded against top players
2011-12-14T02:12:43  <janzert> I think the effort to implement an individual reset is more than the people that would take advantage of it since the people that want it can just resubmit now
2011-12-14T02:12:45  <BenJackson> not people who didn't expect to get there.
2011-12-14T02:12:59  <_flag> You should be seeded wherever your mu dicates you should be seeded imo
2011-12-14T02:13:07  <BenJackson> _flag: your OLD mu?
2011-12-14T02:13:13  <BenJackson> I'm just talking about after a reset
2011-12-14T02:13:13  <janzert> allowing people to choose opponents is bad for rankings
2011-12-14T02:13:20  <_flag> janzert: I mean for people who complain that their bots don't get practice with new bots

2011-12-14T02:21:01  <Fluxid> i guess it's just pure luck and i'll fall down
2011-12-14T02:21:02  <BenJackson> got a good view of 10th
2011-12-14T02:21:25  <BenJackson> I really have no idea if this new sub is going to actually do better
2011-12-14T02:22:02  <Fluxid> i'm higher in rankings than thestinger so i guess it's impossible for me to stay so high, he's much better than me...
2011-12-14T02:23:14  <BenJackson> there are definitely areas in the top 20 that aren't "settling"
2011-12-14T02:23:21  <BenJackson> maybe they will in the finals
2011-12-14T02:23:42  <Fluxid> hey, xathis has mu = 100.79
2011-12-14T02:23:54  <Fluxid> i thought you can't go over 100
2011-12-14T02:24:14  <bqf> as long as he doesn't go over 9000 we'll be fine.
2011-12-14T02:24:23  <BenJackson> that just means on average he beats everybody AND some people who aren't even participating
2011-12-14T02:26:48  <janzert> Fluxid: there is no hard limit on mu, just more unlikely the farther away from 50
2011-12-14T02:26:50  <bqf> which is actually kind of true; i'm not participating, but have been rooting for everyone _but_ xathis (just because he got his lead very early on). so by being at #1 again, he is "beating" me.
2011-12-14T02:27:09  <janzert> at least 99% of bots should be between 0-100
2011-12-14T02:27:15  <Garf> there's a game difficulty factor in the algorithm
2011-12-14T02:27:24  <Garf> if that's misset, ratings can go wider or narrowed easily
2011-12-14T02:27:38  <bqf> janzert: so what you are saying is... xathis is the 1%? (i'm so sorry.)
2011-12-14T02:27:44  <janzert> :)
2011-12-14T02:27:46  <Garf> I'm guessing it can compress again with more games
2011-12-14T02:27:55  <BenJackson> probably what trueskill will try to do over time is push everyone below xathis down (so he can have the right amount of skill points over #2)
2011-12-14T02:28:04  <BenJackson> but there has to be a lot of game play to make that happen

2011-12-14T02:32:56  <AntDroid> BenJackson: based on that game your BFS seems not to stop at an ant for unexplored areas. that snake behavior is an emergent behavior of that technique.
2011-12-14T02:34:07  <BenJackson> I only have a few pathing maps floating around
2011-12-14T02:34:20  <BenJackson> when I have a lot of map visibility there's not much variation for each ant
2011-12-14T02:34:31  <BenJackson> I go to food individually
2011-12-14T02:34:39  <BenJackson> and in this latest version to enemy ants
2011-12-14T02:34:57  <BenJackson> but when I have a huge excess of ants like that they do get aimless
2011-12-14T02:35:11  <BenJackson> if I were starting over I'd rebudget my time

2011-12-14T02:36:38  <BenJackson> easiest "solution" to that is to redefine "unexplored" as "not explored recently"
2011-12-14T02:36:56  <AntDroid> basically i do combat, food, defense, attack enemy hill and explore in order
2011-12-14T02:37:28  <AntDroid> i only do "not explored recently" for non-visible tiles
2011-12-14T02:37:33  <BenJackson> I did all those things simultaneously
2011-12-14T02:37:35  <BenJackson> then split combat
2011-12-14T02:37:44  <BenJackson> then split food
2011-12-14T02:37:51  <BenJackson> then sort of split "maintain vision"
2011-12-14T02:37:57  <BenJackson> finally split "defense"
2011-12-14T02:38:56  <AntDroid> i have after combat and food, 10% of my ants on defense and 50% going for enemy hill attack. the remaining is for exploration
2011-12-14T02:39:48  <AntDroid> i'm currently trying a1k0n's idea, wish i have tried this last week, seems not enough time to make this work well now
2011-12-14T02:40:02  <BenJackson> ooh I got a double game
2011-12-14T02:40:39  <BenJackson> 10 in a row to 231st
2011-12-14T02:40:50  <BenJackson> I seem to remember skill 74 used to be a lot higher than 231st!
2011-12-14T02:42:02  <BenJackson> turns out I was exactly 231st last time at 72.7

2011-12-14T03:11:11  <praveen> no exploration and also it doesnt gather food
2011-12-14T03:17:00  <antimatroid1> imperfect information is a pita

2011-12-14T03:20:55  <bqf> antimatroid1: it's easy - just assume your bot is perfect, i.e. all others can have AT MOST as many ants as you. it's a reasonable assumption if you're aiming for #1. (no, it's not.)

2011-12-14T03:23:05  <antimatroid1> what one wants to know is when they are significantly ahead
2011-12-14T03:23:12  <antimatroid1> so you can just start maximising enemy deaths
2011-12-14T03:24:05  <bqf> antimatroid1: i hope that part in parantheses was indication enough that i was kidding.

2011-12-14T03:24:35  <antimatroid1> i'm also not aiming for #1, but anywhere below that would be awesome
2011-12-14T03:24:47  <antimatroid1> slowly getting less awesome the higher the number

2011-12-14T03:27:27  <bqf> i would say that combining ant counting and map dominance would actually lead to an acceptable heuristic. most "strong" bots don't seem to be easily boxed in, so if you can see 70% of the map you can probably make some rather well-founded assumptions (that could still be completely off, of course - but you'd have _something_ to go on)
2011-12-14T03:29:33  <antimatroid1> sure, but what about n>2 player games? :P
2011-12-14T03:30:05  <janzert> antimatroid1: I can pretty much guarantee that if you're not #1 you'll be somewhere below that :P
2011-12-14T03:30:16  <antimatroid1> janzert: pretty much?
2011-12-14T03:30:36  <janzert> yep, chance of the universe ending and such
2011-12-14T03:30:39  <antimatroid1> i look forward to watching my bots performance in the finals
2011-12-14T03:30:45  <antimatroid1> i just hope it actually runs on the contest servers :P
2011-12-14T03:30:52  <janzert> hehe
2011-12-14T03:31:27  <BenJackson> janzert: don't be too sure, if xathis can have mu > 100 maybe he'll be #0
2011-12-14T03:31:31  <antimatroid1> janzert: did you see my comment before about live leaderboard for the finals?
2011-12-14T03:31:46  <janzert> no I didn't
2011-12-14T03:31:54  <antimatroid1> just wanted to confirm that is the case?
2011-12-14T03:31:59  <antimatroid1> there's a post on the forums asking about it
2011-12-14T03:32:40  <janzert> we don't have a way to shut it off currently and I don't think it would be particularly easy to change either
2011-12-14T03:32:51  <antimatroid1> i don't think we'd want to anyway

2011-12-14T03:32:59  <antimatroid1> it's much more exciting having the leaderboard be live during finals
2011-12-14T03:33:07  <janzert> hmm, I wouldn't mind hiding the top 100 positions
2011-12-14T03:33:16  <janzert> for the last part
2011-12-14T03:33:17  <kevlar> so, maybe I'm missing something, but is there a contest calendar anywhere that says when entries close, last submissions are due, finals are run, etc?
2011-12-14T03:33:24  <antimatroid1> hmmmm
2011-12-14T03:33:34  <janzert> kevlar: bottom of the front page
2011-12-14T03:33:42  <antimatroid1> personally i would just leave it open but i see why one might not
2011-12-14T03:33:48  <janzert> but all that is set is time for open competition to close and finals to start
2011-12-14T03:34:07  <janzert> antimatroid1: yeah, I'm not real strong on it either way
2011-12-14T03:34:11  <kevlar> gasp! couldn't possibly be under the "contest schedule" heading *feels silly*
2011-12-14T03:34:32  <janzert> probably why I haven't bothered trying to change it :)
2011-12-14T03:34:41  <janzert> kevlar: :)
2011-12-14T03:34:44  <antimatroid1> BenJackson: any preferences on the leaderboard being publicly available during the final contest?
2011-12-14T03:35:10  <kevlar> if there's a "fog of war" at the top of the leaderboard, we should still be able to watch their games :)
2011-12-14T03:35:13  <BenJackson> I think both ways will cause great angst
2011-12-14T03:35:14  <antimatroid1> janzert: what might be cool is hiding the rankings but showing the games (probably not feasible for this, but in the future?)
2011-12-14T03:35:19  <BenJackson> but I'd rather see it myself
2011-12-14T03:35:22  <kevlar> or at least the last few games, so you can't figure out the rankings yourself or something
2011-12-14T03:35:27  <antimatroid1> kevlar beat me to it
2011-12-14T03:35:32  <janzert> antimatroid1: that's what my thought was to do
2011-12-14T03:35:35  <BenJackson> from the forums there seems to have been a bit of a dustup over how the last finals went down
2011-12-14T03:35:49  <janzert> hide all display of skill and ranking for top 100 bots basically
2011-12-14T03:35:50  <antimatroid1> BenJackson: link? and what is a dustup?
2011-12-14T03:35:55  <janzert> for the final 24 hours or something
2011-12-14T03:35:59  <BenJackson> but I think if people can see live how positions bounce around and how their own rank is partly determined by the arbitrary stopping point...
2011-12-14T03:36:24  <BenJackson> antimatroid1: slang for a scuffle
2011-12-14T03:36:25  <BenJackson> a fight
2011-12-14T03:36:33  <janzert> for planetwars the last 12-18 hours ranking display was frozen is all
2011-12-14T03:36:39  <kevlar> so, what strategies have people disclosed about how they plan for combat?
2011-12-14T03:36:48  <BenJackson> kevlar: check the forum
2011-12-14T03:36:51  <BenJackson> there are two big threads
2011-12-14T03:36:58  <antimatroid1> game trees!
2011-12-14T03:37:00  <janzert> BenJackson: I don't remember anything like that in particular
2011-12-14T03:37:03  <BenJackson> janzert: maybe you can rely on memcached bugs for that ;-)
2011-12-14T03:37:08  <antimatroid1> kevlar: you are quite late, but still fun to play around :)
2011-12-14T03:37:08  <janzert> :)
2011-12-14T03:37:15  <kevlar> yeah, I'm *way* late
2011-12-14T03:37:31  <antimatroid1> kevlar: someone made top 100 starting with like a week to go last year
2011-12-14T03:37:34  <kevlar> but I managed to get to 1600 on my second day, which I consider pretty good :)

2011-12-14T03:37:52  <kevlar> oh, 1488 now.

2011-12-14T03:45:31  <kevlar> but I was apparently making it waaaay more difficult than it had to be

2011-12-14T03:45:45  <kevlar> so I may try that out just for pokes and giggles.

2011-12-14T07:38:43  <antimatroid> Anilm3: that's no fun

2011-12-14T07:40:13  <_flag> 1v1s are tricky anyway because they're played counter intuitive to a regular game
2011-12-14T07:40:30  <Anilm3> are you really 16 years old?
2011-12-14T07:40:40  <antimatroid> is flag 16?
2011-12-14T07:40:44  <Anilm3> yeah
2011-12-14T07:40:45  <_flag> In a 1v1 agression is good and regular games it's bad (generalization)
2011-12-14T07:40:46  <_flag> yes

2011-12-14T07:41:54  <Fluxid> one of my friends went straight from middle school to uni

2011-12-14T10:47:54  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/NZExUe8c
2011-12-14T10:47:58  <antimatroid> well i now handle that correctly
2011-12-14T10:48:31  <antimatroid> top left stays still, top right moves down and bottom right goes left
2011-12-14T10:48:54  <antimatroid> anyone have anything to add to that example?
2011-12-14T10:52:46  <antimatroid> talk strategies with me people!
2011-12-14T10:54:30  <besh> why doesn't top left go down ?
2011-12-14T10:56:09  <besh> ok maybe because b can move west
2011-12-14T10:56:18  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Are you trying to find a way to kill for sure A without giving him a chance to kill any your ant?
2011-12-14T10:56:45  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: what's A?
2011-12-14T10:56:58  <UncleVasya> *a
2011-12-14T10:57:06  <antimatroid> i want to kill b
2011-12-14T10:57:24  <antimatroid> well, i want to get as close to b as possible without him being able to kill one of my ants
2011-12-14T10:57:24  <UncleVasya> yep, messed with letters.
2011-12-14T10:57:49  <antimatroid> i've just added and extra set of moves into my game tree to handle it
2011-12-14T10:58:09  <antimatroid> it finds "battle slack" and tries to minimise the positive battle slack
2011-12-14T10:58:29  <UncleVasya> Maybe you'll find more interesting to find a possibility for _b_ to not give away his life for free?
2011-12-14T10:59:10  <UncleVasya> wow, have I made a Shakespeare-like sentence now?
2011-12-14T10:59:53  <UncleVasya> I mean if there is a situation for _b_ where he can do 2 things:
2011-12-14T11:00:08  <UncleVasya> 1. go for 1-to-1 exchange
2011-12-14T11:00:25  <UncleVasya> 2. step back without exchange
2011-12-14T11:00:34  <antimatroid> when picking out offensive moves for one of my ants, i for each move location, inside the attack radius i check for move locations of enemies and the maximum friends they could be battling, then minimise that and the battle slack is like min(possibleFriendEnemies) - possibleEnemies

2011-12-14T11:01:01  <antimatroid> nah, see i already use a game tree for picking combat moves but the sample of moves i take is stupid in situations like that
2011-12-14T11:01:07  <antimatroid> i'm hoping this extra set of moves might help
2011-12-14T11:01:08  <UncleVasya> And choise 2 is leading to position where there is no more hope for _b_ to go for 1-to-1.
2011-12-14T11:01:57  <UncleVasya> So on the very beginning _b_ must go into 1-to1 exchange, althought steping away is higher in score.

2011-12-14T14:14:43  <thestinger> and I never really merged in my improved combat... it still just does 2 sets of moves for the enemy
2011-12-14T14:14:45  <BenJackson> this version really had very little tuning
2011-12-14T14:14:57  <thestinger> generating a bunch of moves just makes my bot too cautious
2011-12-14T14:15:02  <BenJackson> it wasn't really getting meaningful games on fluxid where I lost and could see why
2011-12-14T14:15:08  <BenJackson> although I think fluxid is just losing games
2011-12-14T14:15:12  <thestinger> so I just duct tapped together the memetix combat, and the payoff matrix style
2011-12-14T14:15:15  <thestinger> that's what my bot does atm
2011-12-14T14:15:17  <BenJackson> because I see games go by on my console that never appear

2011-12-14T14:15:31  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-14T14:15:33  <BenJackson> but when I check fluxid I've won 5 in a row

2011-12-14T14:16:11  <BenJackson> yeah, it's harder for me to spot those
2011-12-14T14:16:13  <thestinger> or some interesting loss where I hold off for a long time and then die - nope, vanishes
2011-12-14T14:16:20  <BenJackson> easier to see when it goes by for several minutes moving only 1 ant

2011-12-14T14:16:48  <thestinger> we think the tcp server eats our games :P
2011-12-14T14:16:52  <Fluxid> wha
2011-12-14T14:16:52  <BenJackson> Fluxid: see recent sb
2011-12-14T14:16:53  <thestinger> anyway, too late to worry about that
2011-12-14T14:17:19  <Fluxid> BenJackson: lemme check something
2011-12-14T14:17:21  <BenJackson> Fluxid: 1) game rate "appears" to be way down on fluxid
2011-12-14T14:17:30  <BenJackson> 2) thestinger and I have both noticed games played that never show up
2011-12-14T14:17:53  <Fluxid> BenJackson: try to load your profile
2011-12-14T14:18:15  <Fluxid> IndexError: list index out of range
2011-12-14T14:18:17  <Fluxid> ok, fuck
2011-12-14T14:18:22  <Fluxid> hey, how about i drop db?
2011-12-14T14:18:34  <BenJackson> drop table?
2011-12-14T14:18:38  <Fluxid> whole db
2011-12-14T14:18:42  <BenJackson> what db?
2011-12-14T14:18:45  <thestinger> sqlite
2011-12-14T14:18:46  <Fluxid> it's fucked up
2011-12-14T14:18:47  <BenJackson> in sqlite that's a file
2011-12-14T14:18:59  <BenJackson> I'm pretty sure db<->file in sqlite
2011-12-14T14:19:02  <Fluxid> by dropping db i meant removing the file, right
2011-12-14T14:19:12  <Fluxid> because it's screwed up
2011-12-14T14:19:19  <BenJackson> you can sqlite into it
2011-12-14T14:19:23  <Fluxid> it lost consistency somehow
2011-12-14T14:19:40  <BenJackson> and do a transaction to empty the tables

2011-12-14T14:19:43  <BenJackson> if you're worried about restarting
2011-12-14T14:19:52  <BenJackson> sqlite does concurrency right
2011-12-14T14:19:58  <thestinger> no, I don't think so
2011-12-14T14:20:03  <thestinger> only one process can open the db
2011-12-14T14:20:13  <thestinger> and it's just a library the program uses, not a server type thing
2011-12-14T14:20:15  <BenJackson> you can definitely have multiples
2011-12-14T14:20:21  <thestinger> you can have multiple readers
2011-12-14T14:20:28  <BenJackson> multiple writers
2011-12-14T14:20:38  <Fluxid> < thestinger> only one process can open the db
2011-12-14T14:20:40  <Fluxid> well...
2011-12-14T14:20:40  <BenJackson> with transactions
2011-12-14T14:20:46  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-14T14:20:54  <BenJackson> http://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html
2011-12-14T14:21:07  <thestinger> ah, so it does have locking
2011-12-14T14:21:09  <BenJackson> well that page is just "we improved over v2" but close enough
2011-12-14T14:21:20  <Fluxid> we have two processes, where one has shitloads of threads
2011-12-14T14:21:23  <BenJackson> what's more you can connect to multiple disjoint sets of dbs
2011-12-14T14:21:32  <Fluxid> buuuuut
2011-12-14T14:21:39  <BenJackson> sqlite live.db test.db and then do soem transaction to move data from live to test or whatever
2011-12-14T14:21:44  <Fluxid> i have no idea what should i do to regain consistency
2011-12-14T14:22:08  <BenJackson> Fluxid: this is the first time (when you prompted) that I couldn't load my profile
2011-12-14T14:22:11  <Fluxid> because as i can see almost every profile i check is broken
2011-12-14T14:22:13  <BenJackson> so I'd say it's getting worse
2011-12-14T14:22:21  <Fluxid> yeah
2011-12-14T14:22:57  <BenJackson> so you could just sqlite to the db and in one transaction "drop from table" all the tables

2011-12-14T14:24:51  <BenJackson> it's disturbing to see handles like "foo1983"
2011-12-14T14:24:58  <BenJackson> because at first my mind makes that a random number
2011-12-14T14:25:05  <BenJackson> then it realizes it's probably a birth year
2011-12-14T14:25:07  <BenJackson> then I'm horrified
2011-12-14T14:25:16  <BenJackson> esp when it's like "sexy1992" or something
2011-12-14T14:26:15  <bergmark> BenJackson: Horried by 28 year olds?
2011-12-14T14:26:34  <bergmark> horrified even
2011-12-14T14:27:10  <BenJackson> well it's the 1992+ that get me
2011-12-14T14:27:21  <thestinger> I was born in 1992 :3
2011-12-14T14:27:22  <BenJackson> since those could basically be my kids (I don't have kids)
2011-12-14T14:27:23  <Fluxid> awww yeah
2011-12-14T14:28:11  <Fluxid> fffff

2011-12-14T14:29:14  <UncleVasya> So you nee find some sexy1992 to make kids :D

2011-12-14T14:30:27  <Fluxid> okay

2011-12-14T15:24:50  <BenJackson> one of you could have killed ME and won outright

2011-12-14T15:25:39  <Fluxid> ;)

2011-12-14T15:30:11  <BenJackson> you might have a better chance of a tie for 1st

2011-12-14T15:32:10  <BenJackson> not helping them, necessarily, just not stopping them
2011-12-14T15:33:22  <BenJackson> I guess not knowing if he took C's hill is an issue
2011-12-14T15:33:29  <BenJackson> but if you can see C's hill you can ensure a tie for 1st by giving up yours
2011-12-14T15:33:30  <Fluxid> i didn't have enough ants to defend. few ants got drawn away from hill to left but then more his ants got from north...
2011-12-14T15:34:33  <BenJackson> until now I thought 3 player maps were actually "fair" because I had not expected two to trade
2011-12-14T15:34:53  <BenJackson> I figured even if the 2nd strongest player got a fast start he still comes in second after it's down to 1v1
2011-12-14T15:36:22  <thestinger> BenJackson: I've noticed that before
2011-12-14T15:36:32  <thestinger> it really makes a lot of sense to rush on lots of maps
2011-12-14T15:37:00  <thestinger> because you don't win by building up a huge force and surviving until the end - you win by grabbing a few hills early on :)

2011-12-14T16:09:44  <BenJackson> which was pretty effective pre-combat
2011-12-14T16:09:54  <BenJackson> but no one now seems to intentionally launch sorties like that
2011-12-14T16:10:06  <thestinger> I tried making my ants look for food in pair
2011-12-14T16:10:09  <thestinger> pairs*
2011-12-14T16:10:27  <thestinger> that worked, but now it just wastes too many ants and gets destroyed anyway

2011-12-14T16:11:23  <BenJackson> I think my bot's problem now is that I built a strategy and then added combat so it could execute the strategy without getting killed
2011-12-14T16:11:32  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-14T16:11:36  <BenJackson> then I realized that with everyone having combat the strategy was wrong
2011-12-14T16:11:41  <thestinger> my bot doesn't try to kill enemy enemies
2011-12-14T16:11:42  <BenJackson> so I've changed my strategy
2011-12-14T16:11:51  <BenJackson> but I think now my combat is "wrong" for that
2011-12-14T16:12:05  <thestinger> I would need to rewrite everything to fix it, but it's not going to happen
2011-12-14T16:12:10  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-14T16:12:29  <thestinger> I tried just adding on hunting of enemies, but it sucked
2011-12-14T16:12:43  <thestinger> my combat relies on the fact that my ants are willing to pathfind around enemies to go to another goal

2011-12-14T16:13:53  <BenJackson> ronchaine: works great against "blind" bots
2011-12-14T16:13:58  <thestinger> ronchaine: I think it would hurt more than it would help now
2011-12-14T16:14:06  <BenJackson> against combat bots they'll just kill your block of 4 (assuming your block is blind)
2011-12-14T16:14:06  <Nihil688> hey is there any way to save the replays?
2011-12-14T16:14:13  <thestinger> it's just a nice target with 4 vulnerable corners to a bot with combat
2011-12-14T16:14:32  <BenJackson> Nihil688: the support files are in the "tools" tree
2011-12-14T16:14:41  <ronchaine> I was thinking that it would be kinda useful since they could reorganize themselves to 1x4 or 4x1 wall in one move.

2011-12-14T16:16:20  <BenJackson> a replay is a big json string
2011-12-14T16:16:29  <BenJackson> it can either be embedded in replay.html or loaded from another url
2011-12-14T16:16:54  <BenJackson> depends on where you viewed the replay

2011-12-14T16:22:47  <BenJackson> it's http://aichallenge.org/game/233683

2011-12-14T16:22:51  <thestinger> _newdefend just assigns defenders to enemies near my hill
2011-12-14T16:22:58  <thestinger> with ones closer to the hill getting priority
2011-12-14T16:23:06  <BenJackson> oh, yeah
2011-12-14T16:23:11  <BenJackson> that's what V11 of mine does
2011-12-14T16:23:19  <Nihil688> interesting, so I just use the game number
2011-12-14T16:23:35  <Nihil688> thank's for that
2011-12-14T16:23:44  <thestinger> I do it based on a ratio of defenders : attackers, and I was using int division
2011-12-14T16:23:53  <thestinger> so if there were more enemies, it would assign 0 to each :P
2011-12-14T16:23:59  <BenJackson> ah
2011-12-14T16:24:13  <BenJackson> I think what I do is assign 2 to each until I run out of ants to assign
2011-12-14T16:24:35  <thestinger> I find the ratio, the set it back to 3 if it's higher
2011-12-14T16:24:43  <thestinger> and then assign that many to each (starting with ones closest to the hill)
2011-12-14T16:25:22  <Nihil688> what time are the submissions on Sunday?
2011-12-14T16:25:24  <thestinger> so ceil((double)defenders / (double)attackers) is a lot different than the buggy way I did it before

2011-12-14T16:45:35  <thestinger> and figured out which ideas were good/bad :)
2011-12-14T16:45:53  <BenJackson> I've considered extracting a limited set of parameters and tuning that way
2011-12-14T16:46:15  <Nihil688> my code is a mess at the moment
2011-12-14T16:46:23  <Nihil688> it works fast but design wise... beh

2011-12-14T16:47:03  <McLeopold> BenJackson: I'm checking that game you posted.  We should have let that continue.
2011-12-14T16:47:08  <thestinger> there are some ugly parts where I've been too lazy to write proper higher-order functions
2011-12-14T16:47:27  <thestinger> so I have a few implementations of some stuff
2011-12-14T16:47:33  <Nihil688> meh it just takes time
2011-12-14T16:47:38  <Murashka> Yep. And this is a problem. You invent a new method. Realize it .... and it's getting worse.
2011-12-14T16:47:52  <BenJackson> McLeopold: no, both my enemies were "dead"
2011-12-14T16:47:58  <BenJackson> and there were no hills for me
2011-12-14T16:48:02  <BenJackson> to take
2011-12-14T16:48:14  <thestinger> BenJackson: but one of the enemies could have killed _you_
2011-12-14T16:48:24  <BenJackson> yes but players without hills don't count for that
2011-12-14T16:48:29  <thestinger> they should :P
2011-12-14T16:48:38  <Nihil688> kamikaze ants
2011-12-14T16:48:41  <BenJackson> I'm just explaining why it's not a bug as the spec is written
2011-12-14T16:48:43  <McLeopold> BenJackson: at one point, we included the scoring leader, but I need to check the history
2011-12-14T16:49:01  <Nihil688> right i ll go back and work a bit at it
2011-12-14T16:49:08  <Nihil688> thanks everyone
2011-12-14T16:49:12  <BenJackson> my real disappointment with that game is that I thought 3-way games would favor the best player
2011-12-14T16:49:20  <thestinger> I haven't really read the game spec xD
2011-12-14T16:49:25  <BenJackson> but once there's a trade it doesn't necessarily
2011-12-14T16:49:35  <thestinger> just the map generator part, and the battle algorithm

2011-12-14T16:49:52  <McLeopold> BenJackson: maybe a special bonus for lone survivor is in order
2011-12-14T16:49:56  <BenJackson> I read the symmetry code very carefully when I was working on that
2011-12-14T16:50:58  <thestinger> I'm curious about how you dealt with that without using up too much time
2011-12-14T16:51:08  <BenJackson> McLeopold: if it was still in the design phase I'd suggest that trading somehow cancel out
2011-12-14T16:51:35  <BenJackson> since two ants each with their own hills is 1-1, but if they trade it's 2-2, but did they really do anything worthwhile?
2011-12-14T16:51:47  <thestinger> well, maybe losing your hill should have been -2
2011-12-14T16:52:00  <BenJackson> that would change multi-hill mazes dramatically
2011-12-14T16:52:00  <thestinger> it would be a different game though
2011-12-14T16:52:13  <BenJackson> it would make them favor the long-term guy

2011-12-14T16:53:40  <thestinger> it would be neat if capturing a hill gave you control if it, and the ranking was determined by who survived the longest

2011-12-14T16:53:52  <McLeopold> BenJackson: I'm not trying to make it so the ant with the hill left wins, I need to make him lose more :)
2011-12-14T16:54:03  <BenJackson> I think I will announce my symmetry idea on Sunday morning to cause maximum chaos :)
2011-12-14T16:54:05  <thestinger> and you could come "back to life" by recapturing a hill
2011-12-14T16:54:18  <McLeopold> BenJackson: is it really better than dmj111?
2011-12-14T16:54:21  <thestinger> BenJackson: lol, as everyone tries to implement it and reuploads buggy versions that crash? xD
2011-12-14T16:54:44  <BenJackson> McLeopold: well.. it's not the same
2011-12-14T16:54:59  <BenJackson> it gives you only a subset of what his does
2011-12-14T16:55:02  <McLeopold> are you detecting food spawning in 2 places on the same turn? :)
2011-12-14T16:55:04  <BenJackson> but it's the subset you care about
2011-12-14T16:55:07  <BenJackson> and is practially free
2011-12-14T16:55:10  <BenJackson> McLeopold: yes!
2011-12-14T16:55:19  <thestinger> detecting food spawns seems very useful
2011-12-14T16:55:27  <McLeopold> that was my method, but I haven't finished it yet
2011-12-14T16:55:54  <BenJackson> with that and like 10 lines of code you can ID potential enemy hills *if* the map symmetry is north
2011-12-14T16:56:00  <thestinger> BenJackson: so McLeopold figured out your sneaky trick? xD
2011-12-14T16:56:04  <BenJackson> what I didn't bother with was finding the relative map symmetries around each food
2011-12-14T16:56:13  <BenJackson> but that's pretty easy
2011-12-14T16:56:28  <BenJackson> the problem was I'd be able to find hills on the other side of the map in like 20 turns
2011-12-14T16:56:53  <BenJackson> McLeopold: I actually think that's a bug in the game engine
2011-12-14T16:56:57  <BenJackson> it "leaks" symmetry information
2011-12-14T16:57:27  <McLeopold> by design
2011-12-14T16:57:38  <BenJackson> anyway guys like dmj111 could use that to eliminate like 90% of their cases the first time they saw 2 food
2011-12-14T16:58:03  <BenJackson> because 2 simultaneous food are almost always two congruent points on the map
2011-12-14T16:58:41  <BenJackson> so if you saw the food you could look at your whole list of symmetries and reject any that don't admit your new food
2011-12-14T16:58:56  <BenJackson> (with the caveat that there are ways for food to appear other ways, but rarely)
2011-12-14T16:58:58  <McLeopold> they are congruent
2011-12-14T16:59:12  <BenJackson> McLeopold: not if one is delayed
2011-12-14T16:59:37  <McLeopold> hmm, and if we spawn on multiple congruent spots, I guess
2011-12-14T16:59:49  <BenJackson> but for my method a "rogue" food would just fail to have any local rotational symmetry with any other and I'd ignore it
2011-12-14T17:00:03  <BenJackson> for the "eliminate matrices" version you'd have to know if you could truly eliminate them
2011-12-14T17:00:25  <BenJackson> anyway it's very quick to implement as long as you skip the rotation part
2011-12-14T17:00:32  <BenJackson> which at the time I worked on it worked for >90% of the maps
2011-12-14T17:00:37  <BenJackson> so I just tested with them
2011-12-14T17:01:37  <McLeopold> so just random walk?
2011-12-14T17:02:39  <BenJackson> if you run ants.py as a program it spits out the symmetry info
2011-12-14T17:02:41  <BenJackson> you probably know that
2011-12-14T17:02:54  <BenJackson> so I ran it on all the maps and only tested on the aim=0 ones

2011-12-14T17:05:41  <BenJackson> McLeopold: how many maps will there be in the finals?
2011-12-14T17:05:48  <McLeopold> dont' know
2011-12-14T17:05:49  <BenJackson> it seems odd to me to have more maps than each bot will play games
2011-12-14T17:05:54  <BenJackson> (which is where the contest site is now)
2011-12-14T17:06:13  <McLeopold> maybe one map per game?
2011-12-14T17:06:25  <McLeopold> generate a new map for every matchup?

2011-12-14T17:06:29  <BenJackson> ow!
2011-12-14T17:06:33  <BenJackson> that's interesting
2011-12-14T17:06:43  <BenJackson> I like the idea of new maps for finals
2011-12-14T17:06:55  <BenJackson> but I *also* like the idea of picking the known-good maps for finals
2011-12-14T17:06:57  <thestinger> I don't like how some of the maps are more unfair based on which opponents are next to you
2011-12-14T17:07:02  <BenJackson> the ones with the best ant-distinguishing power
2011-12-14T17:07:17  <thestinger> like one of the original mazes had 2 players next to each other, and then another 2 across the map
2011-12-14T17:07:26  <BenJackson> that's still in the rotation
2011-12-14T17:07:31  <keith_> anyone else having problems seeing their games on fluxid?  I can see the global list of all recent games, including mine -- but when i go to my player page, it is empty
2011-12-14T17:07:38  <BenJackson> people are talking about the game where xathis lost 04p_02
2011-12-14T17:07:54  <BenJackson> keith_: he tried to reset it earlier when the db got corrupted
2011-12-14T17:08:09  <keith_> kk, thanks ben
2011-12-14T17:08:13  <thestinger> BenJackson: lol, I think I know where this started
2011-12-14T17:08:30  <thestinger> around a week or two ago he manually fixed a broken thing
2011-12-14T17:08:35  <BenJackson> fluxid is still missing a ton of games if you just look at the replay #s on the front page
2011-12-14T17:08:45  <thestinger> the page for 'strcat' wouldn't load due to a broken game
2011-12-14T17:08:51  <thestinger> so he deleted it
2011-12-14T17:09:02  <BenJackson> oh, not a ton, maybe just a few
2011-12-14T17:09:17  <keith_> you're correct, it is missing lots o' games.  bummer
2011-12-14T17:09:18  <thestinger> I think the server is just buggy
2011-12-14T17:09:19  <rwest_> BenJackson: I only see a couple missing
2011-12-14T17:09:28  <rwest_> past 30 min ago
2011-12-14T17:09:33  <rwest_> anything else coul,d still be running
2011-12-14T17:09:51  <BenJackson> how low does my sigma need to go before the matchmaker starts pulling me in to non-seeded games?
2011-12-14T17:11:14  <McLeopold> BenJackson: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/mapgen/cell_maze.py#L759
2011-12-14T17:13:52  <BenJackson> basically the same loop is what I used
2011-12-14T17:14:40  <BenJackson> it'd be fun to repeat ants with teams
2011-12-14T17:14:45  <BenJackson> everyone pair off
2011-12-14T17:14:46  <McLeopold> for multi-hill cell mazes, I use that to know what player should be in what position
2011-12-14T17:15:32  <BenJackson> at first I thought I was rereading the food symmetries code in ants.py
2011-12-14T17:15:36  <BenJackson> I assume a similar author :)
2011-12-14T17:16:38  <McLeopold> yep :)
2011-12-14T17:16:51  <McLeopold> probably a copy paste :)

2011-12-14T17:20:32  <McLeopold> if it fails, I don't create a file

2011-12-14T17:32:01  <amstan> McLeopold: since they kinda look like the maps that people on the forums are complaining about, where the players are one in a line

2011-12-14T17:34:52  <besh> hmm flagcapper just resubmitted. It is crunch time everywhere ..
2011-12-14T17:35:02  <amstan> it's based on luck then, on how the players order is
2011-12-14T17:35:21  <amstan> if you're next to xathis you're screwed, if you're opposite to xathis it's slightly better
2011-12-14T17:35:33  <McLeopold> I disagree
2011-12-14T17:35:52  <McLeopold> if you have some defense and can get an ant out to the open field, you can keep you spawn rate up
2011-12-14T17:36:04  <McLeopold> it's part of the game
2011-12-14T17:36:07  <amstan> it doesn't matter where you ants are, you hill will still be there

2011-12-14T17:36:23  <amstan> it's clear that a stronger bot will prefer attacking the neighbours first, then the hills farther
2011-12-14T17:36:32  <McLeopold> so will theirs
2011-12-14T17:36:47  <McLeopold> high food gathering can compensate
2011-12-14T17:37:22  <amstan> yes, but using the same food gathering technique can get your farther if you're far away from the crazy bot

2011-12-14T17:41:14  <amstan> yes?
2011-12-14T17:41:34  <McLeopold> I remembering we outvoted janzert on that awhile back, while testing extended play
2011-12-14T17:41:49  <amstan> yes, but i don't see how it's relevant
2011-12-14T17:41:56  <amstan> it is a little, but not a lot
2011-12-14T17:42:48  <McLeopold> well, for ties, we'd let the game go longer
2011-12-14T17:43:12  <amstan> it's not about ties though
2011-12-14T17:43:16  <McLeopold> so, if you are in the lead, we check to see if your rank can go down as well
2011-12-14T17:43:23  <amstan> i'm talking when you have maps like this:
2011-12-14T17:43:28  <amstan> 0 1 2 3
2011-12-14T17:43:31  <amstan> all in the same line

2011-12-14T17:43:47  <amstan> let's say 0 is a good bot and can kill everyone easily
2011-12-14T17:43:53  <amstan> 1 and 3 will have a much harder time than 2
2011-12-14T17:44:01  <McLeopold> BenJackson posted in the forums about a game that should have gone longer, I agree with him
2011-12-14T17:44:03  <amstan> even if 1 2 and 3 were the same
2011-12-14T17:44:15  <yoden-cloud> you just need to have enough games
2011-12-14T17:44:21  <yoden-cloud> and that sort of positional bias should average out
2011-12-14T17:44:44  <amstan> yoden-cloud: yes, but it's not a good idea to induce such randomness in the games
2011-12-14T17:44:46  <McLeopold> amstan: can we go away from starting position discussions to cutoff rules now :)
2011-12-14T17:44:50  <amstan> yoden-cloud: it just makes rankings converge slower
2011-12-14T17:45:13  <yoden-cloud> yeah, and the rankings already converge so slow
2011-12-14T17:45:18  <amstan> McLeopold: that's what i meant by problems with my mapgen
2011-12-14T17:45:26  <amstan> yoden-cloud: therefore it's not a good idea to make them even slower

2011-12-14T18:08:43  <antimatroid> does a bot count as participating when they have no hills?
2011-12-14T18:08:59  <BenJackson> not for cutoff by rank stabilized
2011-12-14T18:09:02  <antimatroid> i thought we quite often cut bots off when they don't have hills left, even if they could still increase in ranking?
2011-12-14T18:09:18  <janzert> antimatroid: it isn't yes or no, just sometimes
2011-12-14T18:09:25  <antimatroid> ie. in a 2 player game the moment a hill is razed the game is over right?
2011-12-14T18:09:30  <janzert> I wanted it to be straight up no but was over ruled
2011-12-14T18:09:49  <janzert> you'll have to consult with McLeopold and amstan to figure out what exactly sometimes means ;)
2011-12-14T18:09:53  <antimatroid> i'm with janzert, it's highly unideal to change something now, but personally i think the rank stabilised thing was pretty messed up for this
2011-12-14T18:11:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: whate are the rules for a bot to count as "still participating"?
2011-12-14T18:12:01  <BenJackson> personally I think there should have been a way for white to win :)
2011-12-14T18:12:11  <janzert> :)
2011-12-14T18:12:37  <antimatroid> BenJackson; sure but we know about that "bug" with the game
2011-12-14T18:13:34  <antimatroid> in the future i think the best thing to do would be to only cut a game short of max turns if no bot can change in ranking

2011-12-14T18:14:27  <janzert> I'd rather bots that lose all their hills be straight up knocked out of the game at that point, i.e. their controller can no longer communicate with the ants
2011-12-14T18:15:11  <janzert> I don't really think we should do either or anything else of course
2011-12-14T18:16:09  <antimatroid> janzert: i'm not sure i agree, take a 2 player example, what if the "losing player" was 1 turn from also razing the enemy hive?
2011-12-14T18:16:29  <antimatroid> i was told months ago the game should make intuitive sense for real life, in real life an ant isn't going to just stop because it'd hill has been razed
2011-12-14T18:16:37  <antimatroid> its*
2011-12-14T18:16:41  <janzert> should of put a little thought into defense
2011-12-14T18:16:49  <janzert> in real life an ant controls itself
2011-12-14T18:17:05  <janzert> here we have a hive mind of some sort
2011-12-14T18:17:09  <antimatroid> sure, and it can be here, it just has telepathic information sharing :P

2011-12-14T18:42:40  <antimatroid> i guess they could increase in ranking if an enemy razed their hill
2011-12-14T18:43:17  <antimatroid> no they couldn't
2011-12-14T18:43:23  <Antimony> how do you handle deciding when to make trades in combat?
2011-12-14T18:43:36  <antimatroid> Antimony: only trade if you kill more than you lose
2011-12-14T18:43:46  <antimatroid> otherwise i minimise friend deaths
2011-12-14T18:44:18  <Antimony> but it seems like 1v1 trades aren't always good
2011-12-14T18:44:24  <Antimony> like if they have a lot more ants than you
2011-12-14T18:44:47  <antimatroid> you kill the same as you lose then, don't trade, minimise friend deaths
2011-12-14T18:44:52  <Dan___> McLeopold... they got my hill 100 turns later
2011-12-14T18:44:52  <Dan___> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=234363&user=4165
2011-12-14T18:45:10  <Dan___> not sure what caused my timeout
2011-12-14T18:48:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: so why is that game cut short?
2011-12-14T18:48:24  <McLeopold> the only player with a hill left can' get any points
2011-12-14T18:48:28  <McLeopold> can't
2011-12-14T18:48:42  <McLeopold> the other 2 leaders could beat each other, but that is it
2011-12-14T18:49:12  <McLeopold> so, don't bother fighting ants if they don't have a hill, just urn
2011-12-14T18:49:13  <antimatroid> yes, but the remaining participating player can't change in ranking right?
2011-12-14T18:49:14  <McLeopold> run
2011-12-14T18:49:28  <McLeopold> no, there are no hills to raze, no points to be had
2011-12-14T18:49:37  <antimatroid> so the game hasn't been cut short?
2011-12-14T18:49:43  <McLeopold> even if he exterminated everyone and had enough growth to cover all land
2011-12-14T18:49:51  <antimatroid> that's my point
2011-12-14T18:49:58  <antimatroid> people said it was cut short? but cut short of what?
2011-12-14T18:50:18  <McLeopold> well, the 2 tied for the lead could try and raze his hill, so you might see a different outcome
2011-12-14T18:50:35  <McLeopold> instead of 1,1,3 it could be 1,2,3
2011-12-14T18:50:39  <antimatroid> yes, but our definition of rank stabilised here is the same as anywhere else
2011-12-14T18:50:50  <antimatroid> 1,2,2 -> 1,2,3*
2011-12-14T18:50:59  <antimatroid> 1,2,2 -> 0,2,3*
2011-12-14T18:51:36  <antimatroid> while i don't agree with it, we are cutting plenty of other games short when a non-participating player could increase in ranking
2011-12-14T18:52:03  <McLeopold> right, I would only want to extend it if it is the *leader* who could lose in rank
2011-12-14T18:52:17  <antimatroid> why?
2011-12-14T18:52:23  <McLeopold> if fact, I thought I had that code in there
2011-12-14T18:52:24  <antimatroid> all rankings are equally important to trueskill no?
2011-12-14T18:52:47  <McLeopold> yes, I would extend all games until all ranks are finalized up or down if I could
2011-12-14T18:52:50  <antimatroid> why does it matter if it's the leader or second last place who could lose in ranking?
2011-12-14T18:53:05  <antimatroid> i think we should at least be consistent either way
2011-12-14T18:53:12  <McLeopold> for the same reason nobody cares about last place
2011-12-14T18:53:22  <antimatroid> they do though, or they should

2011-12-14T19:05:24  <yoden-cloud> so... at some point, my bot started randomly timing out during setup
2011-12-14T19:05:45  <yoden-cloud> and I cannot for the life of me figure out why
2011-12-14T19:06:24  <amstan> McLeopold: what do you think? http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2122
2011-12-14T19:07:11  <antimatroid> i hope my computer is worse than the servers
2011-12-14T19:07:59  <antimatroid> amstan: what would the grid be? and how is the physics going to work?
2011-12-14T19:08:10  <antimatroid> if we're going for something like that I think we should talk to delt0r
2011-12-14T19:08:20  <amstan> floating point?
2011-12-14T19:08:24  <antimatroid> the game he had in the works sounded pretty awesome
2011-12-14T19:08:26  <amstan> physics based on time steps
2011-12-14T19:08:58  <McLeopold> amstan: I like it
2011-12-14T19:09:12  <McLeopold> floating point will be an issue
2011-12-14T19:09:13  <antimatroid> another possibility would be a game where you go around shooting your enemies
2011-12-14T19:09:18  <antimatroid> and bullets have a given trajectory
2011-12-14T19:09:21  <amstan> McLeopold: we could go with a very small grid then
2011-12-14T19:09:32  <BenJackson> if we're talking about xpilot (or asteroids in general) the precision isn't that big a deal
2011-12-14T19:09:32  <amstan> 32 bit to represent the whole map
2011-12-14T19:09:35  <McLeopold> is there a terminal velocity in space, besides light speed?
2011-12-14T19:09:38  <antimatroid> or we could allow people to program their own missile scripts, like a missile can't go backwards or stay sitll?
2011-12-14T19:09:50  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what about neutrinos? :P
2011-12-14T19:10:00  <amstan> yes! we could get acceleration dependent on speed, so you can't get to speed of light
2011-12-14T19:10:15  <McLeopold> right, I just wonder what the formula is
2011-12-14T19:10:23  <antimatroid> what happens to an asteroid when you shoot it?
2011-12-14T19:10:37  <McLeopold> splits in half
2011-12-14T19:10:40  <amstan> antimatroid: that's an issue
2011-12-14T19:10:49  <amstan> do we want to make this stochastic or what?
2011-12-14T19:10:51  <McLeopold> I would say all objects are perfect circles
2011-12-14T19:11:05  <McLeopold> colisions split in half at the tagent
2011-12-14T19:11:08  <antimatroid> did any of you play that old dos game where you controlled a ship on a grid and had to shoot down enemy ships who were trying to shoot you down etc.?
2011-12-14T19:11:08  <amstan> splits in half, but then where do the parts go?
2011-12-14T19:11:12  <antimatroid> something like that could work well
2011-12-14T19:11:22  <McLeopold> use momentum equations on points

2011-12-14T19:11:38  <amstan> McLeopold: is there any way to predict where the smaller parts will go?
2011-12-14T19:11:39  <antimatroid> amstan: personally i'm very against making games stochastic
2011-12-14T19:11:41  <McLeopold> maybe add perpendicular momentum to the 2 new objects
2011-12-14T19:11:51  <BenJackson> antimatroid: food is already stochastic
2011-12-14T19:12:08  <antimatroid> BenJackson: sure, but i mean like stochastic resolution etc.
2011-12-14T19:12:20  <antimatroid> ie. the random spawn tiebreak for ants I despise
2011-12-14T19:12:26  <McLeopold> I prefer deterministic
2011-12-14T19:12:43  <amstan> how about sub particle velocity=old particle velocity+velocity tangential to the bullet
2011-12-14T19:12:48  <BenJackson> I think asteroids would be awesome BUT I think it would restrict the participants a lot
2011-12-14T19:12:59  <BenJackson> eg tron's winnin strategy was heavy on graph theory and etc
2011-12-14T19:13:07  <BenJackson> but anyone could play it
2011-12-14T19:13:14  <BenJackson> ants is a little harder
2011-12-14T19:13:14  <McLeopold> amstan: yes
2011-12-14T19:13:20  <BenJackson> but still anyone can gather food and wander around
2011-12-14T19:13:22  <antimatroid> I rekon a grid based game where your ships can shoot torpedos that your bot can also control would be cool
2011-12-14T19:13:27  <amstan> the point of the game would be make your opponent crash with an asteroid
2011-12-14T19:13:49  <BenJackson> in a space sim even knowing where you want to go still requires significant math to figure out how to thrust there efficiently
2011-12-14T19:13:52  <McLeopold> the controls would be "left, right, straight" and "burn noburn"
2011-12-14T19:13:55  <McLeopold> and "fire"
2011-12-14T19:14:01  <amstan> BenJackson: yes
2011-12-14T19:14:07  <thestinger> "self-destruct"
2011-12-14T19:14:10  <amstan> McLeopold: burn?
2011-12-14T19:14:12  <amstan> thestinger: why?
2011-12-14T19:14:13  <BenJackson> (disclaimer: I have written parts of the xpilot ai)
2011-12-14T19:14:24  <thestinger> amstan: dunno :P
2011-12-14T19:14:31  <amstan> thestinger: exit(1)
2011-12-14T19:14:34  <McLeopold> amstan: like, fire up the engines and go forward
2011-12-14T19:14:45  <thestinger> amstan: but then you don't take out nearby enemies :(
2011-12-14T19:15:07  <amstan> McLeopold: what's straight for then?
2011-12-14T19:15:12  <McLeopold> don't turn
2011-12-14T19:15:31  <BenJackson> is there fuel?  does burning fuel reduce your weight?
2011-12-14T19:15:35  <BenJackson> does running out leave you stranded?
2011-12-14T19:15:36  <McLeopold> unless we say turning and burning can't happen at the same time
2011-12-14T19:15:37  <BenJackson> can you refuel?
2011-12-14T19:15:49  <BenJackson> aww you ahve to be able to "turn and burn"!
2011-12-14T19:15:52  <thestinger> maybe just have a left thruster and a right thruster and you can turn them on/off
2011-12-14T19:16:05  <amstan> would we want to make this physics accurate? have rotational momentum and so on?
2011-12-14T19:16:10  <McLeopold> no
2011-12-14T19:16:15  <BenJackson> gravity?
2011-12-14T19:16:22  <BenJackson> unidirectional or towards suns?
2011-12-14T19:16:22  <thestinger> black holes!
2011-12-14T19:16:23  <amstan> gravity would be nice too
2011-12-14T19:16:24  <McLeopold> no
2011-12-14T19:16:35  <BenJackson> hohman transfer orbits
2011-12-14T19:16:42  <amstan> shooting directly at another player?
2011-12-14T19:16:48  <amstan> BenJackson: yes, lol
2011-12-14T19:16:57  <McLeopold> sling shot torpedos
2011-12-14T19:16:59  <antimatroid> should totally be able to shoot down opponents
2011-12-14T19:17:07  <thestinger> well, maybe you should have a recharge rate for shooting
2011-12-14T19:17:08  <antimatroid> i like the idea of bot controlled torpedos
2011-12-14T19:17:13  <antimatroid> with different rules about how they can move
2011-12-14T19:17:39  <amstan> it would be nice if there was a way to make particle calculations impossible to do
2011-12-14T19:17:41  <amstan> like
2011-12-14T19:17:46  <amstan> have asteroids in the game
2011-12-14T19:18:00  <amstan> and make it so it's impossible to predict the positions of all of them
2011-12-14T19:18:06  <antimatroid> what would obstacles be?
2011-12-14T19:18:08  <amstan> you can get the game engine more cores, and code in C
2011-12-14T19:18:16  <antimatroid> just open maps with asteroids?
2011-12-14T19:18:27  <amstan> antimatroid: i'm not sure, but that would be cool
2011-12-14T19:18:32  <BenJackson> btw one key part of xpilot is how slow the shots are
2011-12-14T19:18:39  <BenJackson> ships can easily fly faster than shots
2011-12-14T19:18:42  <amstan> trying to predict where asteroids would be without actually simulating everything manually
2011-12-14T19:18:54  <BenJackson> so imparting your own momentum to shots is important
2011-12-14T19:19:02  <amstan> BenJackson: are shot velocities relative to ship velocities?
2011-12-14T19:19:06  <BenJackson> yes
2011-12-14T19:19:08  <amstan> nice
2011-12-14T19:19:13  <BenJackson> xpilot is a lot of fun
2011-12-14T19:19:28  <amstan> k, that's it
2011-12-14T19:19:29  <amstan> aptgetting it
2011-12-14T19:19:36  <amstan> BenJackson: have a server or something?
2011-12-14T19:19:37  <BenJackson> and already has a full engine with arbitrary maps and replays and etc
2011-12-14T19:19:43  <thestinger> xpilot-ng?
2011-12-14T19:19:50  <thestinger> there's a package for that I'm installing atm
2011-12-14T19:19:55  <antimatroid> amstan: what's the plan post ants?
2011-12-14T19:19:57  <BenJackson> yeah, I thik that's U's version
2011-12-14T19:20:07  <BenJackson> U did a rewrite in C++ at some point, but that's after my time
2011-12-14T19:20:08  <amstan> antimatroid: get another game going, implement it with django
2011-12-14T19:20:10  <McLeopold> maybe different types of ammunition might be nice
2011-12-14T19:20:11  <antimatroid> are we going to bite the bullet and do zeta? or just patch another game together with the existing framework?
2011-12-14T19:20:27  <BenJackson> thestinger: it's all client-server already
2011-12-14T19:20:28  <amstan> antimatroid: the patching part was supposed to take 1 month
2011-12-14T19:20:36  <BenJackson> so you can already write a client bot if you want
2011-12-14T19:20:40  <BenJackson> people probably have
2011-12-14T19:20:45  <amstan> antimatroid: unfortunatelly it 8
2011-12-14T19:21:04  <thestinger> definitely a lot of similar stuff you can do, it could be with planes/subs rather than in space
2011-12-14T19:21:12  <amstan> BenJackson: do you have a server?
2011-12-14T19:21:28  <McLeopold> heat seeking torpedos...
2011-12-14T19:21:41  <McLeopold> turn of engines and float to avoid
2011-12-14T19:21:45  <McLeopold> or lead to enemy
2011-12-14T19:21:59  <amstan> it would be nice if this could be real time
2011-12-14T19:22:04  <amstan> where it doesn't matter if you timeout
2011-12-14T19:22:12  * antimatroid wants tcp servers for past games :(
2011-12-14T19:22:14  <amstan> you just keep going
2011-12-14T19:22:14  <antimatroid> :p
2011-12-14T19:22:15  <thestinger> it would be really neat to have some kind of mechanic like how sub/plane battles happen - where shooting reveals your location
2011-12-14T19:22:23  <McLeopold> you can get semi-real time

2011-12-14T19:22:30  <BenJackson> I did years ago
2011-12-14T19:22:37  <McLeopold> allow different actions to take different amounts of time

2011-12-14T19:24:03  <thestinger> works for me
2011-12-14T19:24:10  <McLeopold> I also thought a tank game might be fun, where you shoot projectiles, like scorched earth
2011-12-14T19:24:17  <BenJackson> or atari TANK
2011-12-14T19:24:32  <McLeopold> that was actually what I was thinking :)
2011-12-14T19:24:43  <thestinger> nice, shooting propels you backwards
2011-12-14T19:24:44  <McLeopold> they had a shoot to reveal mode in that, didn't they?
2011-12-14T19:24:57  <McLeopold> but you didn't know where you where either
2011-12-14T19:25:10  <McLeopold> thestinger: or forwards
2011-12-14T19:25:14  <thestinger> wow wtf, the controls are like 20 pages long
2011-12-14T19:25:14  <BenJackson> thestinger: with enough multishot it can overcome your thrust
2011-12-14T19:25:18  <BenJackson> without boosted thrusters
2011-12-14T19:25:26  <BenJackson> thestinger: there are TONS of powerups
2011-12-14T19:25:36  <BenJackson> but most people play one particular map which is very simple
2011-12-14T19:25:38  <BenJackson> blood's music
2011-12-14T19:26:01  <BenJackson> early on walls were super deadly (in the classic style) but these days the walls are a bit softer
2011-12-14T19:26:43  <thestinger> amstan: how are you running it?
2011-12-14T19:26:59  <McLeopold> amstan: the only problem is a game of asteroids doesn't have a natural time span
2011-12-14T19:27:08  <thestinger> I'm using an xpilot-ng package and there's an xpilot-ng-server and xpilot-ng-x11 as the client
2011-12-14T19:27:27  <thestinger> there's also xpilot-ng-sdl which works too
2011-12-14T19:27:31  <McLeopold> unless we limit fuel and ammunition
2011-12-14T19:27:35  <thestinger> it has a server menu thing to join existing ones
2011-12-14T19:27:37  <antimatroid> McLeopold: sure it does, take out all the enemy ships
2011-12-14T19:27:42  <antimatroid> don't let people spawn more
2011-12-14T19:28:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you can have a situation where 2 players don't make progress
2011-12-14T19:28:11  <McLeopold> it was impossible in tron

2011-12-14T19:28:22  <thestinger> xD
2011-12-14T19:28:22  <McLeopold> the game had a natual ending, no matter what happened

2011-12-14T19:28:52  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't think you'll ever get that with games where the state isn't permanently altered from each move
2011-12-14T19:29:05  <antimatroid> ie. tron, dots and boxes, etc.
2011-12-14T19:29:36  <McLeopold> right, so limiting fuel and ammunition helps with that
2011-12-14T19:29:38  <amstan> McLeopold: we could have the asteriods randomly split
2011-12-14T19:29:52  <amstan> and they could split to the point where it's hard to avoid them

2011-12-14T19:29:59  <antimatroid> amstan: banach-tarski split?
2011-12-14T19:30:06  <amstan> ?
2011-12-14T19:30:16  <antimatroid> both new asteroids are the same size :P
2011-12-14T19:30:23  <antimatroid> so eventually they fill the map
2011-12-14T19:30:56  <ikaros> some kind of multiplayer bomberman could be funny too
2011-12-14T19:31:04  <antimatroid> amstan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox
2011-12-14T19:31:58  <amstan> antimatroid: i don't get it
2011-12-14T19:32:09  <amstan> ikaros: but that's pretty much minimax
2011-12-14T19:32:25  <McLeopold> amstan: so, in classic asteroids, they split 3 times, we can split more than that
2011-12-14T19:32:32  <antimatroid> it is possibly to take a 3-dimensional sphere and turn it into 2 identical copies
2011-12-14T19:32:36  <antimatroid> not physically possibly, but possible
2011-12-14T19:32:39  <ronchaine> Can you write data to the disk and read it later?
2011-12-14T19:32:40  <antimatroid> possible*
2011-12-14T19:32:58  <McLeopold> ronchaine: later the same game, yes, but not between games
2011-12-14T19:33:19  <McLeopold> ronchaine: but we'd rather you didn't, and if you exceed 10MB, it's bad
2011-12-14T19:33:31  <amstan> ronchaine: you might as well just use ram
2011-12-14T19:33:33  <ikaros> amstan, doesnt need to be a classic approach.. could include buying options or whatever to increase complexity.. but i agree it probably would end in minmax
2011-12-14T19:34:03  <ikaros> thing is asteroid stuff will be 70% physics
2011-12-14T19:34:42  <amstan> i think it's relevant though, you have lots of cases where physics and ai are intermingled
2011-12-14T19:34:49  <antimatroid> fyi i will try and minimax everything you throw at me
2011-12-14T19:35:02  <ikaros> yea its relevant
2011-12-14T19:35:13  <amstan> antimatroid: so if i accelerate using a float force, go minimax that
2011-12-14T19:35:18  <antimatroid> ikaros: barely, the physics should be simple to learn
2011-12-14T19:35:27  <antimatroid> then it's about what you can do with it, which is going to be maths
2011-12-14T19:35:28  <ronchaine> McLeopold, amstan: ok, thanks
2011-12-14T19:35:45  <ikaros> well
2011-12-14T19:35:52  <antimatroid> amstan: i'd heuristically pick our moves for me and the opponents and run minimax on that
2011-12-14T19:36:00  <antimatroid> like i did for planet wars and like i am for combat in ants
2011-12-14T19:36:17  <amstan> and i don't think physics would be that much, you can definatelly finish everything physics related for the bot
2011-12-14T19:36:21  <amstan> as for ai, you'll never know

2011-12-14T19:37:14  <McLeopold> it wouldn't be too hard
2011-12-14T19:37:26  <McLeopold> starter bots come with some equations
2011-12-14T19:37:48  <ikaros> i would love something which requires strategic planning alot more.. like sim games.. but this would probably be to complex and i cant propose an actual idea
2011-12-14T19:37:48  <amstan> though i would still like some aspect of it that can't be perfectly simulated with physics, so bots would have to use other methods
2011-12-14T19:37:53  <antimatroid> i want to do a grid based game where the squares have a randomly assigned height and you can only walk between locations when like abs(loc1.height-loc2.height) < b
2011-12-14T19:38:20  <antimatroid> sim games?
2011-12-14T19:38:31  <ikaros> simulation
2011-12-14T19:38:35  <amstan> antimatroid: i want to make a minecraft like game, where you can change the map around you
2011-12-14T19:38:41  <McLeopold> antimatroid: isn't that just a maze?
2011-12-14T19:38:44  <antimatroid> amstan: yes please :)
2011-12-14T19:38:45  <ikaros> thats a nice idea amstan
2011-12-14T19:38:47  <McLeopold> unless you can always go down?
2011-12-14T19:39:01  <antimatroid> McLeopold: sure, but you don't have any explicit walls
2011-12-14T19:39:14  <antimatroid> and it might be cool to allow a bot to always walk down
2011-12-14T19:39:23  <McLeopold> so, one way doors?
2011-12-14T19:39:27  <antimatroid> in fact that's awesome
2011-12-14T19:39:35  <antimatroid> cause then you can have sections of the map what are like walled off
2011-12-14T19:39:41  <antimatroid> and then they need to build their way back out etc.
2011-12-14T19:40:13  <amstan> but that's still minimaxable
2011-12-14T19:40:24  <antimatroid> depends on the size of hte grids
2011-12-14T19:40:26  <amstan> or a*
2011-12-14T19:40:40  <antimatroid> you can't minimax entire battle partitions in ants
2011-12-14T19:40:44  <antimatroid> it's just not going to happen
2011-12-14T19:41:00  <amstan> if you have one agent, doesn't really matter what the size is, you can only do so many actions per turn
2011-12-14T19:41:20  <amstan> lemmings?
2011-12-14T19:41:28  <ikaros> =)
2011-12-14T19:41:43  <antimatroid> worms!
2011-12-14T19:41:53  <thestinger> the built-in AI in xpilot-ng is killing me :)
2011-12-14T19:42:27  <amstan> thestinger: yeah, for the asteroids game, any kind of starter package would kill all humans
2011-12-14T19:42:51  <amstan> since they can easily predict/calculate what the state will be after a delta t
2011-12-14T19:42:59  <thestinger> and the controls are pretty crap :P
2011-12-14T19:43:02  <thestinger> a and s to steer

2011-12-14T22:52:59  *** Dan__ is now known as Guest15667
2011-12-14T22:53:10  <Guest15667> where I keep randomly timing out
2011-12-14T22:53:24  <Guest15667> at various parts of my code...
2011-12-14T22:53:27  <Guest15667> in Battle Res
2011-12-14T22:53:32  <Guest15667> issuing orders, etc...
2011-12-14T22:53:51  <Guest15667> it seems like 300-400ms of nothing happens in between 2 logging lines of code
2011-12-14T22:53:57  <Guest15667> no loops, etc...
2011-12-14T22:54:21  <Guest15667> anybody have any ideas how to debug?
2011-12-14T22:54:23  <amstan> what king of logging?
2011-12-14T22:54:25  <amstan> what language?
2011-12-14T22:55:05  <Guest15667> Java... FileWriter to a .txt file
2011-12-14T22:55:27  <amstan> that could be it
2011-12-14T22:55:58  <amstan> did you try removing that? or switching it with an if statment?

2011-12-14T22:56:22  <Guest15667> yeah I've turned off all logging and I still crash
2011-12-14T22:56:42  <amstan> what happens during the crash then?
2011-12-14T22:56:50  <amstan> where does it crash?
2011-12-14T22:57:01  <yoden1> have you checked memory usage/GC?
2011-12-14T22:57:12  <yoden1> i had a nasty memory leak which caused similar problems :(
2011-12-14T22:57:14  *** yoden1 is now known as yoden
2011-12-14T22:57:16  <Guest15667> sorry... doesn't crash... times out
2011-12-14T22:57:23  <Guest15667> it times out in random places
2011-12-14T22:57:24  <amstan> Guest15667: yes, but where?
2011-12-14T22:57:36  <amstan> well, you have to figure out where
2011-12-14T22:57:52  <Guest15667> that's the thing, it times out in a different place every time
2011-12-14T22:58:04  <Guest15667> lemme try making sure all logging is turned off
2011-12-14T22:58:06  <Guest15667> everywhere
2011-12-14T22:58:13  <Guest15667> because that would make sense...
2011-12-14T22:58:17  <amstan> well
2011-12-14T22:58:20  <amstan> not really
2011-12-14T22:58:28  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-14T22:58:31  <amstan> i was under the impression that your timeout was happening during the logging
2011-12-14T22:58:43  <amstan> if that's not the case logging might actually help you solve your problem
2011-12-14T22:59:01  <amstan> assuming you're certain it's not a significant time user
2011-12-14T22:59:18  <Guest15667> the last logging I get is:
2011-12-14T22:59:19  <Guest15667> [250] moveParticipantAndUpdateBattles 11: Friendly at ((12,42)) | X
2011-12-14T22:59:27  <Guest15667> that means there are 250 ms left in the turn
2011-12-14T22:59:31  <Guest15667> and that's the last thing I logged
2011-12-14T22:59:41  <Guest15667> but I'll get a random assortment of those last lines
2011-12-14T22:59:53  <Guest15667> at various places in my program
2011-12-14T23:00:01  <Guest15667> with various amounts of time left
2011-12-14T23:00:31  <amstan> well, i'm not sure, get those debugs in more places
2011-12-14T23:00:49  <amstan> also.. as yoden said, GC might kick in at unexpected times
2011-12-14T23:01:07  <amstan> you could try running that manually(if possible) and see how long it takes.
2011-12-14T23:01:10  <Guest15667> interesting...
2011-12-14T23:01:23  <BenJackson> amstan: the site is getting slower
2011-12-14T23:01:26  <thestinger> try running it at the start of every turn if you can, not sure if Java lets you do that
2011-12-14T23:01:29  <Guest15667> ok i'll check that out...
2011-12-14T23:01:29  <BenJackson> bigger db? more traffic?
2011-12-14T23:01:44  <Guest15667> anybody have any GC tips?
2011-12-14T23:01:47  <Guest15667> that are doing Java?
2011-12-14T23:01:50  <BenJackson> eg I hit reload on my profile page before I said that
2011-12-14T23:01:51  <BenJackson> it's still loading
2011-12-14T23:01:55  <amstan> BenJackson: mysql is high cpuing
2011-12-14T23:02:17  <amstan> janzert: help
2011-12-14T23:02:28  * BenJackson laughs
2011-12-14T23:02:39  <amstan> BenJackson: lol
2011-12-14T23:02:51  <amstan> i could restart it, but that means i have to restart all workers
2011-12-14T23:02:59  <amstan> which would be a pain to do manually
2011-12-14T23:03:06  <thestinger> site is still fast for me
2011-12-14T23:03:31  <thestinger> oh, the rankings do lot pretty slowly
2011-12-14T23:03:40  <thestinger> load*
2011-12-14T23:03:57  <amstan> it might be just temporary
2011-12-14T23:03:59  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/organization_profile.php?org=2693 what?
2011-12-14T23:04:34  <amstan> thestinger: oh man! css issue! what is that?

2011-12-14T23:05:14  <BenJackson> anyway I can I join [undefined]?  I'd be winning
2011-12-14T23:05:22  <thestinger> lol
2011-12-14T23:05:30  <BenJackson> I'm not winning "Other" or "C++"
2011-12-14T23:05:36  <BenJackson> or probably USA but I didn't actually check
2011-12-14T23:05:38  <thestinger> switch to C++11
2011-12-14T23:05:42  <thestinger> http://aichallenge.org/language_profile.php?language=C%2B%2B11 :)
2011-12-14T23:05:47  <BenJackson> thestinger: I actually considered that
2011-12-14T23:05:56  <thestinger> actually no, don't
2011-12-14T23:06:00  <thestinger> I want to be the top of that xD
2011-12-14T23:06:09  <BenJackson> I haven't gotten back to top 10 since my resubmit
2011-12-14T23:06:24  <thestinger> it took a while for my bot to climb back up
2011-12-14T23:06:38  <CIA-48> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * rc0aa09c / website/css/layout.css : fixed min-height for the new sidebar height - http://git.io/PfPcOw
2011-12-14T23:06:44  <thestinger> it's kinda specialized at killing the mid to high level bots, and sucks against the top ones
2011-12-14T23:06:51  <thestinger> not that I intended to do that
2011-12-14T23:07:21  <thestinger> anyway fluxid's server is broken again too
2011-12-14T23:07:22  <BenJackson> pguillor and a1k0n almost certainly keep me from winning USA.  actually "C++" might be doable but I'd have to up my game
2011-12-14T23:07:25  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_newdefend
2011-12-14T23:08:01  <BenJackson> due to fluxid's misbehavior I don't really know how my current bot does against top bots other than my own previous submission
2011-12-14T23:08:20  <thestinger> well, now I have no idea if my new defense code works xD
2011-12-14T23:08:27  <thestinger> oh... I can check on the search page
2011-12-14T23:08:55  <BenJackson> new bot beats old bot very reliably and slaughters old old bot
2011-12-14T23:09:07  <thestinger> nice, _newdefend climbed up from 50 mu with the broken code to 57.4
2011-12-14T23:09:38  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/search?name=strcat too many branches lol.
2011-12-14T23:09:46  *** xathis <xathis!~xathis@g230250114.adsl.alicedsl.de> has quit IRC ()
2011-12-14T23:09:52  <BenJackson> so I modified my code now so that often on smallish maps my bot can guarantee itself it knows where every enemy is
2011-12-14T23:10:05  <BenJackson> this isn't such a boon because it doesn't react that smartly anyway :)
2011-12-14T23:11:11  <BenJackson> what's driving me nuts at the moment is trying to understand what "in between" is for two points in a grid separated by a diagonal
2011-12-14T23:11:20  <thestinger> yeah, site seems to be grinding to a halt or something
2011-12-14T23:11:21  <janzert> amstan: yes?
2011-12-14T23:11:26  <BenJackson> because of manhattan distance potentially every point in the entire rectangle is "on the way"
2011-12-14T23:11:34  <amstan> janzert: mysql is doing more cpu than usual
2011-12-14T23:11:56  <janzert> because it's constantly generating matchups now
2011-12-14T23:12:02  <janzert> at least that's my guess
2011-12-14T23:12:06  *** treeform <treeform!~treeform@c-69-181-52-73.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-12-14T23:12:18  <BenJackson> and throwing them away?
2011-12-14T23:12:22  <amstan> shouldn't it stop when it fills a buffer or something?
2011-12-14T23:12:26  <janzert> it's sorta just barely keeping up with the workers
2011-12-14T23:12:27  <amstan> seems rather wasteful
2011-12-14T23:12:30  <janzert> it's not getting ahead at all
2011-12-14T23:12:56  <janzert> I could cut the number of workers down ;)
2011-12-14T23:13:14  <amstan> can this be distributed?
2011-12-14T23:13:15  <BenJackson> wow 24 workers
2011-12-14T23:13:35  <BenJackson> some of the servers have 0% fail
2011-12-14T23:13:36  <BenJackson> huh
2011-12-14T23:14:02  <janzert> that's just for the last half hour like all the other stats listed there so varies wildly
2011-12-14T23:14:04  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/XAt66mK6
2011-12-14T23:14:16  <janzert> output from the matchup generator script
2011-12-14T23:14:25  <janzert> as you can see it isn't really getting ahead
2011-12-14T23:14:32  <BenJackson> matchup maker doing to many expensive queries?
2011-12-14T23:14:33  <amstan> janzert: i don't get it though, before we had like 5gpm(at the beggining and beta)
2011-12-14T23:14:52  <janzert> yes?
2011-12-14T23:14:52  <amstan> janzert: isn't that just half the number of matchups?
2011-12-14T23:14:55  <BenJackson> amstan: near 11 now
2011-12-14T23:15:00  <janzert> right
2011-12-14T23:15:23  <amstan> so why does it take more than 2 times the cpu? too many players?
2011-12-14T23:15:34  <BenJackson> you should 'explain' the queries the matchup maker is doing to see if you need an index somewhere
2011-12-14T23:15:40  <BenJackson> or if perhaps an index is missing for some reason
2011-12-14T23:15:42  <janzert> because it's going constantly instead of just half the time?
2011-12-14T23:16:02  <janzert> it uses the same cpu while generating the matchup I'm sure
2011-12-14T23:16:40  <BenJackson> probably more with 8000 users than in the beta
2011-12-14T23:16:49  <janzert> and it has gotten longer to generate matchups as the contest has progressed, I haven't looked yet to see if it is because of more users or more game history
2011-12-14T23:17:21  <BenJackson> do you use complete game history (for things you try to balance per player) or only current version?
2011-12-14T23:17:49  <janzert> I actually think it just uses past 24 hours for any game history in the matchup
2011-12-14T23:17:53  <janzert> but I may be remembering wrong
2011-12-14T23:18:08  <BenJackson> huh, before totaalnet that would have been like 3 games
2011-12-14T23:18:51  <janzert> closer to 8
2011-12-14T23:19:11  <BenJackson> some days :)
2011-12-14T23:20:08  <amstan> janzert: what was the reason we couldn't use clock time again?
2011-12-14T23:20:11  <amstan> sorry
2011-12-14T23:20:12  <amstan> cpu time*
2011-12-14T23:20:25  <janzert> nobody implemented it
2011-12-14T23:20:35  <amstan> oh
2011-12-14T23:20:50  <BenJackson> if you want it as a secondary check I'll implement it
2011-12-14T23:20:56  <BenJackson> assuming python can get to it
2011-12-14T23:21:00  <janzert> next contest at this point
2011-12-14T23:21:06  <janzert> you can't get it directly
2011-12-14T23:21:13  <janzert> you have to work through the /proc info
2011-12-14T23:21:19  <janzert> for what we need
2011-12-14T23:21:29  <janzert> and convert from jiffies to ms
2011-12-14T23:21:41  <amstan> i still get surprised, the code is now open source, why don't more people hack at it?
2011-12-14T23:21:54  <BenJackson> what's wrong with resource.getrusage?
2011-12-14T23:22:36  <Zannick> amstan: laziness
2011-12-14T23:22:57  <amstan> i should be more inviting when people complain about this on the forums
2011-12-14T23:23:10  <amstan> it has worked in the past actually
2011-12-14T23:23:22  <amstan> we got a few website features with it
2011-12-14T23:23:24  <thestinger> yeah, I don't think people know help is wanted
2011-12-14T23:23:35  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-14T23:23:41  <janzert> BenJackson: hmm, looks like it doesn't give child information for children still alive
2011-12-14T23:23:51  <BenJackson> although thank god I didn't hear about this sooner or I'd have been hacking on ant ai all summer
2011-12-14T23:24:15  <thestinger> amstan: if you do something like making a wishlist I bet people will start implementing stuff
2011-12-14T23:24:18  <amstan> thestinger: where would you expect to find such info?
2011-12-14T23:24:18  <BenJackson> janzert: ?? it should
2011-12-14T23:24:39  <janzert> http://linux.die.net/man/2/getrusage doesn't seem to be what that page is saying
2011-12-14T23:24:58  <janzert> "usage statistics for all children of the calling process that have terminated and been waited for"
2011-12-14T23:24:59  <BenJackson> amstan: fwiw I thought "aicontest" was dead when I couldn't find the planetwars archives
2011-12-14T23:25:08  <BenJackson> this was some time before ants started
2011-12-14T23:25:19  <amstan> BenJackson: hmm, that's bad, lol
2011-12-14T23:25:27  <janzert> ? they didn't change until ants launched
2011-12-14T23:25:59  <janzert> ai-contest.com was exactly as the planetwars contest had left it until then
2011-12-14T23:26:01  <amstan> yeah, the only thing that did was the forums
2011-12-14T23:26:18  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2011-12-14T23:26:27  <amstan> i guess the website should be more dynamic and more informative regarding these things
2011-12-14T23:26:41  <BenJackson> I never heard about tron at all
2011-12-14T23:26:47  <BenJackson> so I thought pw was a one-off
2011-12-14T23:26:49  <thestinger> amstan: a link the github repo in the sidebar would be good
2011-12-14T23:26:51  <BenJackson> when I had trouble finding it
2011-12-14T23:27:18  <amstan> thestinger: any idea where?
2011-12-14T23:27:31  <janzert> but anyway hopefully by next contest cpu time can be the primary measurement with wall clock a secondary
2011-12-14T23:27:45  <janzert> cpu time can't be the only one btw
2011-12-14T23:28:04  <thestinger> amstan: maybe under Past Contests you could put an About section
2011-12-14T23:28:05  <amstan> because sleep 10000 trolls?
2011-12-14T23:28:34  <janzert> yeah, or other things that would have basically the same effect
2011-12-14T23:29:06  <amstan> do you get IO waits for loading stuff from ram into cache?
2011-12-14T23:29:38  <janzert> I think that time will still fall under cpu time for you
2011-12-14T23:30:02  <amstan> yeah, because if not, that would be a significant time for bots that use a lot of ram
2011-12-14T23:30:08  <janzert> pretty positive actually, but should confirm it at some point
