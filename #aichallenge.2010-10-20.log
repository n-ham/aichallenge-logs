2010-10-20T00:43:38  <foucist> ask away
2010-10-20T00:44:03  <codefun> Can anyone explain or suggest as to why my bot deletes it's entire empire (turns it's planets into neutral and all fleets in flight dissapear) after a certain amount of turns? It's usually 14 turns, then POOF I turn into neutral and the enemy wins.
2010-10-20T00:44:14  <codefun> I can't find any errors in my code, I'm using perl
2010-10-20T00:45:42  <codefun> I think I just fixed it.... nevermind XD

2010-10-20T00:52:57  <codefun> Agh no the problem wasn't solved... it just chose a larger number of turns until crash.
2010-10-20T00:53:07  <codefun> Why do the coding gods hate me so!
2010-10-20T00:53:54  <foucist> codefun: how the heck does a bot sacrifice itself anyways
2010-10-20T00:54:08  <codefun> I have no idea
2010-10-20T00:54:18  <codefun> It's an odd glitch.
2010-10-20T00:54:35  <codefun> It's happened before but I knew the cause; it tried sending ships to a planet that didn't exist
2010-10-20T00:54:52  <codefun> And that caused some error that wiped me out. This time that's not the issue though...

2010-10-20T03:19:20  <TioLuiso> Hello people, good morning from spain
2010-10-20T03:19:41  <TioLuiso> I'm having some problem
2010-10-20T03:19:52  <TioLuiso> my bot si losing streaks of games
2010-10-20T03:20:08  <TioLuiso> since a few days ago
2010-10-20T03:20:12  <TioLuiso> in 1st turn
2010-10-20T03:20:26  <TioLuiso> I've looked in forums
2010-10-20T03:20:43  <TioLuiso> and looks like I'm not the only one having that problem
2010-10-20T03:21:11  <TioLuiso> I'm quite confident that it's not a bug in my code
2010-10-20T03:21:39  <TioLuiso> and I don't get the message that i have timed out or had an esception
2010-10-20T03:21:42  <TioLuiso> exceptin
2010-10-20T03:21:47  <TioLuiso> simply, y lose
2010-10-20T03:22:00  <TioLuiso> Is there any way I can get a log?
2010-10-20T03:23:38  *** smloh1 <smloh1!4786e80a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.134.232.10> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-20T03:24:28  <mega1> no, there isn't
2010-10-20T03:28:10  <TioLuiso> the thing is I haven't updated my bot in some time
2010-10-20T03:28:26  <TioLuiso> and it didn't lose that many times before
2010-10-20T03:28:38  <TioLuiso> so I suspect there must be some problem in the server
2010-10-20T03:28:43  <TioLuiso> outside my bot
2010-10-20T03:28:51  <TioLuiso> however, I'll check my bot again
2010-10-20T03:28:54  <TioLuiso> thanks anyway
2010-10-20T03:28:59  <mega1> I used to forfeit some games.
2010-10-20T03:29:08  <mega1> Now I forfeit all.
2010-10-20T03:29:27  <TioLuiso> how's that?
2010-10-20T03:29:34  <mega1> In retrospect it must have been better because the other servers are stronger.
2010-10-20T03:29:47  <mega1> But now there is only a single, puny server.
2010-10-20T03:30:22  <TioLuiso> do you think it has any connection?
2010-10-20T03:30:45  <TioLuiso> that lack of resources can lead to forfeit games?

2010-10-20T06:05:52  <antimatroid> i had that issue, it was incredibly frustrating
2010-10-20T06:06:05  <antimatroid> worked fine locally
2010-10-20T06:06:06  <mega1> but you use less than 0.1s now?
2010-10-20T06:06:18  <antimatroid> i am using as much as i tell it to now
2010-10-20T06:06:19  <antimatroid> but i was there
2010-10-20T06:06:21  <antimatroid> then*
2010-10-20T06:06:37  <mega1> language?
2010-10-20T06:07:07  <antimatroid> c++
2010-10-20T06:07:23  <mega1> no gc then
2010-10-20T06:07:56  <mega1> I suspect severe memory pressure
2010-10-20T06:08:13  <mega1> uploaded a bot that does not allocate garbage just spins for 0.8s

2010-10-20T06:11:24  <delt0r> mega1: what lang?
2010-10-20T06:11:31  <mega1> lisp
2010-10-20T06:11:50  <delt0r> is it quite a old GC?
2010-10-20T06:12:04  <mega1> it has a good gc
2010-10-20T06:12:18  <delt0r> there has been a *lot* of R&D on gc and its bloody fast in java
2010-10-20T06:12:26  <delt0r> 15M won't even show up...
2010-10-20T06:12:27  <mega1> I know, java is ahead.
2010-10-20T06:12:36  <mega1> neither in sbcl
2010-10-20T06:12:54  <mega1> but if there is no physical memory ...
2010-10-20T06:13:00  <delt0r> is it a copy gc..or mark and sweep?
2010-10-20T06:13:09  <mega1> copy
2010-10-20T06:13:52  <delt0r> well to me it sounds like something else is wrong? I mean on anything but crap, is pretty easy to *not* copy 15M
2010-10-20T06:14:07  <delt0r> but i haven't done lisp/scheme for a while
2010-10-20T06:14:24  <delt0r> well i have, but within the jvm aka kava
2010-10-20T06:14:25  <mega1> I don't understand.
2010-10-20T06:14:34  <mega1> easy to not copy?
2010-10-20T06:14:54  <delt0r> well a copy gc just copys live object to the new location...
2010-10-20T06:15:03  <mega1> and?
2010-10-20T06:15:16  <delt0r> its performance is not dependant on the amount of garbarge
2010-10-20T06:15:21  <phreeza> mega1: are you timing out on the official server? sorry didn't read all the history
2010-10-20T06:15:26  <delt0r> other than more collections are needed
2010-10-20T06:15:35  <mega1> are we trying to optimize the gc here?
2010-10-20T06:15:44  <mega1> phreeza: yes
2010-10-20T06:16:08  <delt0r> I thought you said you are timing out without doing anything but producing 15M of garbarge
2010-10-20T06:16:18  <mega1> yes
2010-10-20T06:16:34  <phreeza> ah and the theory is its GC... so i guess youre not using c++

2010-10-20T06:17:01  <delt0r> and it doesn't sound like that should be the problem.... unless you are allocating 15M every ms
2010-10-20T06:17:09  <mega1> right
2010-10-20T06:17:24  <mega1> unless the memory pressure on the system is high
2010-10-20T06:17:35  <mega1> and gc is slowed down by swapping

2010-10-20T06:18:14  <phreeza> can't gc be suspended?
2010-10-20T06:18:19  <delt0r> mega1: true
2010-10-20T06:18:36  <seisatsu> Has anyone here ever touched on or heard of Non-stationary Entropic Reduction Mapping?
2010-10-20T06:18:51  <mega1> it can be suspended and I can optimize my code too, but if it's suspended it will need even more memory the next time
2010-10-20T06:19:00  <delt0r> swaping imo is dumb. its just too slow to be usefull on modern machines... it should be honest and just give a out of mem error
2010-10-20T06:19:07  <mega1> one idea is to invoke it explicitly often
2010-10-20T06:19:19  <seisatsu> It was a technology invented in 1996 and then abandoned. I became interested, and thought I would ask here.
2010-10-20T06:19:28  <seisatsu> It's an AI method, of course.
2010-10-20T06:19:40  <phreeza> seisatsu: no but it sounds interesting
2010-10-20T06:19:55  <seisatsu> It had the ability to be dropped into any system that it had no knowlege of, and learn on its own.
2010-10-20T06:20:21  <seisatsu> By simply telling it when it made a mistake, it would reorganize its own internal workings to avoid it.
2010-10-20T06:20:33  <seisatsu> But perhaps it was replaced by neural nets.
2010-10-20T06:20:33  <phreeza> then it probably sucked otherwise it wouldn't have been discarded?
2010-10-20T06:20:46  <seisatsu> Mm, it was actually made for an interesting game.
2010-10-20T06:20:53  <phreeza> neural nets were around way before 1996
2010-10-20T06:20:53  <seisatsu> The game development team invented it.
2010-10-20T06:21:04  <seisatsu> I know, but you hear a lot about them now.
2010-10-20T06:21:25  <seisatsu> But perhaps that's just my own view since I personally hear a lot more about them now.
2010-10-20T06:22:40  <phreeza> I'm looking into Case Based reasoning, have you heard about that?
2010-10-20T06:22:44  <seisatsu> The game was praised as interesting. Basically, there is a robot that moves on its own. The only interaction allowed is prodding it on its right or left side to change direction. You can also manipulate the environment itself. You try to keep it from dying.
2010-10-20T06:22:50  <seisatsu> From this it learns.
2010-10-20T06:22:54  <seisatsu> Hmm, I have not.
2010-10-20T06:23:23  <seisatsu> mm
2010-10-20T06:23:45  <seisatsu> Cascading decisions upon previous decisions, basically?

2010-10-20T06:24:39  <seisatsu> Am I about right?
2010-10-20T06:27:47  <phreeza> depends on the implementation, some are cascading, some are just a single layer

2010-10-20T06:28:00  <phreeza> the basic idea is having a library of previous cases
2010-10-20T06:28:24  <phreeza> and matching the current situation to those known cases by some metric

2010-10-20T06:28:46  <phreeza> the metric is tricky of course, how do you determine whether 2 scenarios are similar...
2010-10-20T06:29:03  <phreeza> so you probably need pattern matching
2010-10-20T06:29:32  <antimatroid> try to make some kind of definitions that splits the game up into equivalence classes?

2010-10-20T06:29:49  <antimatroid> then look up tables or whatever?
2010-10-20T06:30:34  <phreeza> yea exactly
2010-10-20T06:31:07  <phreeza> and its neat because in theory you could look at replays and say, hey, this should have had a different reaction
2010-10-20T06:31:12  <phreeza> and add that to the library
2010-10-20T06:31:22  <antimatroid> interesting concept, then you could try and train for different equivalence classes
2010-10-20T06:31:42  <antimatroid> you could even try to "solve" some situations and include that
2010-10-20T06:31:50  <phreeza> or you can datamine replays to teach it
2010-10-20T06:33:07  <phreeza> its probably hard to really solve stuff in that level because these classes are abstracted.
2010-10-20T06:33:13  <antimatroid> i'm doing a tree based approach where i make one move at a time, make a tree, then "play" each terminal node and then pick the best stream of moves at the end

2010-10-20T06:34:23  <antimatroid> i would be doing classes based off of structure of the geometry somehow, like do ones for situations of isosceles triangles, then move to general triangles
2010-10-20T06:34:24  <phreeza> yea i'm trying something similar. modelling the opponent is not working well for me though
2010-10-20T06:34:28  <antimatroid> then start adding in more planets etc.
2010-10-20T06:34:36  <antimatroid> maybe try partitioning the graph or something
2010-10-20T06:35:38  <phreeza> yea interesting idea... i was thinking of some kind of similarity metrics on the distance matrices...

2010-10-20T06:41:28  <Rommel> Anyone here?
2010-10-20T06:48:05  <seisatsu> I have actually just sent a formal request to Anark Corporation for details on their 1996 NERM AI technology. :D
2010-10-20T06:48:30  <seisatsu> They haven't so much as touched it in 14 years, and neither has anyone else.
2010-10-20T06:48:55  <antimatroid> ha, good luck with that
2010-10-20T06:48:58  <seisatsu> Haha yeah
2010-10-20T06:49:17  <antimatroid> you will get an email in like 3 years from someone saying wtf
2010-10-20T06:49:21  <Rommel> haha
2010-10-20T06:49:40  <seisatsu> With NERM, an AI can be inserted into any system, and begin adapting to its environment and requirements automatically through trial and error with minimal outside interference.
2010-10-20T06:50:11  <seisatsu> All you basically do is tell it when it's made a mistake.
2010-10-20T06:50:26  <seisatsu> And give it a gentle nudge in the correct direction.
2010-10-20T06:50:43  <seisatsu> It actually then reorganizes its internal structure to adapt
2010-10-20T06:50:57  <seisatsu> It sounds very complicated.
2010-10-20T06:51:32  <seisatsu> An article on it said that NERM is more complex of a system than any environment it might encounter.
2010-10-20T06:51:36  <delt0r> seisatsu: Too it sounds more like marketing tripe.... sorry
2010-10-20T06:51:39  <seisatsu> http://www.domesro.com/2009/07/once-short-lived-robotic-intelligence.html
2010-10-20T06:51:46  <seisatsu> nn
2010-10-20T06:52:00  <seisatsu> *here's a 2009 article looking at it
2010-10-20T06:52:09  <seisatsu> it was used in a single video game, once
2010-10-20T06:52:13  <seisatsu> that was all.
2010-10-20T06:52:17  <Rommel> I'm going mad with trying to get the starter package for C++ ball rolling, I ran the following... and using just the default starter package, and MinGW, it just says that player 2 crashed :(... http://www.pastie.org/1235129
2010-10-20T06:52:20  <seisatsu> It worked extraordinarily well.
2010-10-20T06:52:51  <seisatsu> The only way you could interact directly with it was by touching the robot on either side; a nudge.
2010-10-20T06:52:59  <seisatsu> It learned very quickly.
2010-10-20T06:53:05  <seisatsu> I played that game once.
2010-10-20T06:53:13  <delt0r> yea i saw that... however there are no details at all. There is nothing published. Just wild assertions that it works... and the game got pretty bad reviews...
2010-10-20T06:53:32  <seisatsu> Still, I will enquire.
2010-10-20T06:54:14  <seisatsu> When something gets my interest I will move heaven and earth to grasp it. Until I get bored a few days later.
2010-10-20T06:54:24  <seisatsu> *inquire
2010-10-20T06:54:27  <delt0r> lol--don't we all
2010-10-20T06:54:35  <Rommel> Any ideas anyone?
2010-10-20T06:54:39  <antimatroid> i think there's needs to be an ai comp for a full on 3d game sooner or later
2010-10-20T06:54:46  <antimatroid> there***
2010-10-20T06:54:47  <seisatsu> mm
2010-10-20T06:55:14  <seisatsu> Neural nets now could probably do something similar to this "alleged" NERM, though.
2010-10-20T06:55:16  <delt0r> antimatroid: you mean 3d as in spacially... ie galcon 3d ?
2010-10-20T06:55:24  <phreeza> that would be more like the starcraft comp, i'm happy with these simple games
2010-10-20T06:55:25  <Rommel> Can anyone hear me? lol
2010-10-20T06:55:33  <seisatsu> Rommel, we can
2010-10-20T06:55:34  <delt0r> Rommel: yes
2010-10-20T06:55:39  <delt0r> don't know
2010-10-20T06:55:39  <antimatroid> nah, like first person shooter
2010-10-20T06:55:40  <seisatsu> But nobody cares. :<
2010-10-20T06:55:51  <delt0r> right
2010-10-20T06:55:53  <seisatsu> If it just crashes right away
2010-10-20T06:55:54  <antimatroid> or 3d fighter plane fights or something
2010-10-20T06:56:04  <seisatsu> it's either your fault for something you added
2010-10-20T06:56:09  <delt0r> antimatroid: that could be interesting
2010-10-20T06:56:14  <antimatroid> i don't even play computer games (excepting flash and minesweeper) but writing a bot, sign me up
2010-10-20T06:56:17  <delt0r> in that the game and rules can be simple
2010-10-20T06:56:18  <seisatsu> or the original writer's fault for not discovering a bug.
2010-10-20T06:56:26  <Rommel> lol cheers seisa... I had just finished my C++ backprop... was looking forward to giving it a shot... but if the starter package won't run lol
2010-10-20T06:56:27  <phreeza> the complexity is just too high...
2010-10-20T06:56:30  <antimatroid> 3d fighting would be solved by large numerical pde solutions
2010-10-20T06:56:43  <delt0r> antimatroid: not easily
2010-10-20T06:56:44  <antimatroid> hello differential game theory
2010-10-20T06:56:56  <antimatroid> cough multiplayer optimal control theory cough
2010-10-20T06:56:57  <phreeza> heh like these chasing games?
2010-10-20T06:56:59  <delt0r> if the turning is non holo... whatever
2010-10-20T06:57:11  <delt0r> then it gets real tricky real quick
2010-10-20T06:57:17  <antimatroid> phreeza: i haven't thought about looking at planetwars as a chasing game
2010-10-20T06:57:22  <antimatroid> i wonder if that would be useful
2010-10-20T06:57:40  <antimatroid> you are sort of the pursuer and the evader in a way
2010-10-20T06:58:08  <seisatsu> It looks like Anark Corporation hich designed NERM and the game, is exclusively a 3D technology company now.
2010-10-20T06:58:08  <delt0r> so the simple rules could be acceleration, turning drag, turning radius for speed... and "kill" condtions.
2010-10-20T06:58:14  <seisatsu> They don't do games anymore.
2010-10-20T06:58:19  <seisatsu> *which
2010-10-20T06:58:32  <phreeza> they replied already?
2010-10-20T06:58:33  <seisatsu> Or AI.
2010-10-20T06:58:34  <seisatsu> No
2010-10-20T06:58:38  <antimatroid> delt0r: yep, i expect something like if they are in a certain distance and field of vision, you lose
2010-10-20T06:58:39  <Rommel> Aight I figured it out :P
2010-10-20T06:58:39  <seisatsu> But I looked at the website
2010-10-20T06:58:46  <phreeza> ah
2010-10-20T06:58:49  <antimatroid> you could start from various different positions
2010-10-20T06:58:55  <antimatroid> that'd actually be a really awesome comp
2010-10-20T06:58:59  <Rommel> required libstdc++-6.dll :S
2010-10-20T06:58:59  <phreeza> well if you could track down the actual people involved
2010-10-20T06:59:04  <seisatsu> They cannot have any possible benefit from NERM anymore
2010-10-20T06:59:06  <seisatsu> ah, yes
2010-10-20T06:59:10  <seisatsu> that would be fantastic
2010-10-20T06:59:13  <delt0r> the game visulizer would not be hard to do either
2010-10-20T06:59:23  <antimatroid> amstan: i have the next game for you
2010-10-20T06:59:28  <phreeza> what was the game name?
2010-10-20T06:59:39  <delt0r> or the game engine
2010-10-20T06:59:59  <seisatsu> Galapagos: Mendel's Escape
2010-10-20T07:00:01  <seisatsu> >.>
2010-10-20T07:00:03  <antimatroid> they need someone to make a kickass visualiser for such a game
2010-10-20T07:00:06  <seisatsu> It was interesting
2010-10-20T07:00:12  <phreeza> game engine would be tricky if you want to simulate conrinuous time
2010-10-20T07:00:15  <phreeza> and space
2010-10-20T07:00:16  <seisatsu> but the robot moved so damn slow that everyone got bored
2010-10-20T07:00:27  <delt0r> phreeza: you don't --just close to it
2010-10-20T07:00:31  <seisatsu> That's probably why it rated poorly
2010-10-20T07:00:40  <antimatroid> phreeza: yeah, you could define distance of "forward movement" each turn, and then players could set rotation
2010-10-20T07:00:42  <phreeza> lol what a name...
2010-10-20T07:00:45  <seisatsu> And backtracking was a nightmare
2010-10-20T07:00:46  <antimatroid> and that could be limited based on speed
2010-10-20T07:00:49  <seisatsu> and a time consumer.
2010-10-20T07:00:57  <antimatroid> discretise the problem?
2010-10-20T07:01:10  <seisatsu> If I could get ahold of the original development team's documents
2010-10-20T07:01:20  <delt0r> I had a air to air combat board game once
2010-10-20T07:01:23  <seisatsu> (assuming they kept documents, they're software developers :P)
2010-10-20T07:01:24  <antimatroid> or remove time limits and allow players to make moves based on time?
2010-10-20T07:01:33  <antimatroid> and they can change their move whenever?
2010-10-20T07:01:34  <seisatsu> That would be fantastic.
2010-10-20T07:01:36  <antimatroid> and keep it continuous
2010-10-20T07:01:51  <seisatsu> brb

2010-10-20T07:02:19  <delt0r> antimatroid: if its "true" continuous I would think doing something like the simulation football would be a good idea.
2010-10-20T07:02:35  <delt0r> ie tcp/ip messages
2010-10-20T07:02:49  <delt0r> time jitter is a problem for the bot...
2010-10-20T07:03:04  <delt0r> but a strict trun based system could be done as well

2010-10-20T07:03:45  <delt0r> though many would find it hard. Calculus always trips people up... eps 1st year comp sci folk ;)
2010-10-20T07:03:59  <antimatroid> i kind of like the idea of no concept of discrete moves, then players can just set rotation for a given time
2010-10-20T07:04:09  <antimatroid> and it's up to them to estate where they will be in space
2010-10-20T07:04:23  <antimatroid> i think 2d would be too easy to solve, so one would have to do 3d anyway
2010-10-20T07:04:55  <delt0r> antimatroid: simulation gets tricky however... there really still are "turns" --its just they are too short compared to "response" time
2010-10-20T07:05:26  <phreeza> how would you differentiate between chaser and chasee? :D
2010-10-20T07:05:32  <delt0r> antimatroid: 2d is not so easy... my planes in the RTS i am doing have all this... getting a "ai" to follow a path for optimal time is hard
2010-10-20T07:05:47  <delt0r> phreeza: you don't --its a dog fight
2010-10-20T07:05:48  <antimatroid> neither, first to get their field of vision on the oponent wins, you can have draws, buti think it works
2010-10-20T07:05:57  <phreeza> oh so they can shoot?
2010-10-20T07:06:02  <phreeza> ahead?
2010-10-20T07:06:19  <delt0r> more like getting a lock like in Topgun
2010-10-20T07:06:30  <delt0r> but yea
2010-10-20T07:06:30  <antimatroid> you could have a gun with bullet speed and health, but i think games would take too long
2010-10-20T07:06:53  <delt0r> antimatroid: there is a body of work on that... but guess who by?
2010-10-20T07:07:05  <delt0r> not so many will be able to get the papers...
2010-10-20T07:07:27  <antimatroid> not sure? i have a couple of dover books on differential game theory
2010-10-20T07:07:37  <antimatroid> <3 amazon
2010-10-20T07:08:00  <delt0r> if the speed affect the turn radius it really isn't such an easy problem
2010-10-20T07:08:19  <delt0r> if turn radius affects drag and changes speed its really hard

2010-10-20T07:08:53  <antimatroid> the learning curve to get started would be quite high

2010-10-20T07:09:52  <antimatroid> would you allow people to "reverse"?
2010-10-20T07:10:23  <delt0r> well if we are going for "aircraft" then no... but since its a game...
2010-10-20T07:10:27  <delt0r> for ai
2010-10-20T07:10:33  <antimatroid> or, car racing ai game would be pretty cool
2010-10-20T07:10:40  <contestbot> Top 10 players: cfaftw(3517), dmj111(3408), Polsky(3385), rsergio(3384), smatcher(3356), DracoAter(3341), EBraun(3325), savchenko(3311), deepblue(3308), asavis(3278)
2010-10-20T07:10:51  <delt0r> complex physics would put some people off..
2010-10-20T07:10:51  <phreeza> it would probably need to be mixed up some more... i think straight up chasing has been dealt with extensively in literature, no?
2010-10-20T07:10:52  <antimatroid> hard to make symmetric tracks though
2010-10-20T07:10:53  <delt0r> but

2010-10-20T07:11:17  <delt0r> if you can write a bot that gets around the track easy... perhaps its not so bad
2010-10-20T07:11:33  <delt0r> antimatroid: just have "fastest time"
2010-10-20T07:11:59  <delt0r> not full race... or do you like "positional" play
2010-10-20T07:12:03  <antimatroid> nah, for it to be a game you need both players on a track
2010-10-20T07:12:12  <delt0r> ie a car can block someone from passing
2010-10-20T07:12:13  <antimatroid> otherwise it's more of a decision problem
2010-10-20T07:12:16  <phreeza> antimatroid: could use TORCS for that
2010-10-20T07:12:24  <phreeza> racing
2010-10-20T07:12:33  <antimatroid> well, a game is a decision problem, but a decision problem isn't necessarily a game
2010-10-20T07:13:00  <antimatroid> like mario ai wasn't a game
2010-10-20T07:13:14  <antimatroid> not formally speaking anyway
2010-10-20T07:14:17  <antimatroid> nplayer ai comps would be cool too, but the analysis gets sooo much harder
2010-10-20T07:14:37  <Error323> and thus the game soo much simpler -,-
2010-10-20T07:14:38  <antimatroid> cause you'd start wanting to form coalitions with the players near you at the start of the game
2010-10-20T07:14:40  <Error323> :P
2010-10-20T07:14:51  <Error323> well the solving mechanics
2010-10-20T07:14:54  <Error323> hehe
2010-10-20T07:16:15  <antimatroid> for example, in nplayer planetwars ai, for those of you who expand, you would want to take those who didn't out before fighting each other, otherwise they're going to take whoever wins out of you after you fight
2010-10-20T07:16:16  <phreeza> i'd like a game with a simulated stock market, with unlimited players...
2010-10-20T07:16:25  <antimatroid> phreeza: you mean the stock market?
2010-10-20T07:16:34  <phreeza> hehehe
2010-10-20T07:16:55  <phreeza> well don't know if i would want to put money on my bot :)
2010-10-20T07:17:13  <antimatroid> that's why you use other peoples finances :P
2010-10-20T07:17:26  <delt0r> so a real market then
2010-10-20T07:17:26  <phreeza> so i should join GS? :)
2010-10-20T07:18:28  <antimatroid> ha, i am very tempted to run off and do algo trading rather than a phd
2010-10-20T07:18:52  <antimatroid> i think i overestimate how much it'd be like a big ai contest though
2010-10-20T07:19:11  <phreeza> did you read about the guys who got arested for writing a trading algo that gamed the bigger ones?

2010-10-20T07:20:16  <antimatroid> i'm about 30k in debt from uni aha
2010-10-20T07:20:18  <delt0r> same with short selling and naked short selling
2010-10-20T07:20:32  <antimatroid> but it's australia, so i get to pay it back when i can and don't have interest above inflation :)
2010-10-20T07:20:33  <delt0r> they whole thing is a crok of very smelly brown stuff

2010-10-20T07:21:26  <delt0r> mine dept is for NZ...
2010-10-20T07:21:39  <delt0r> and the interest rate is more than my CC here in Austria

2010-10-20T07:22:20  <delt0r> not even half of the intreset
2010-10-20T07:22:22  <phreeza> i can easily pay for it with some freelancing

2010-10-20T07:23:06  <delt0r> she is then alowed to go to uni here in Austria
2010-10-20T07:23:14  <delt0r> but she keeps failing
2010-10-20T07:23:17  <antimatroid> does anyone else sometimes resort to the dreaded ctrl z method to fixing their bot?

2010-10-20T07:23:26  <phreeza> oh
2010-10-20T07:23:32  <antimatroid> and lose all the wonderful changes they did make to somehow solve the one you can't find
2010-10-20T07:23:33  <phreeza> but shes already done with high school?
2010-10-20T07:23:45  <delt0r> phreeza: no
2010-10-20T07:24:05  <delt0r> year before the matura...or whatever its called... for the 2nd time

2010-10-20T07:24:31  <phreeza> in germany its kind of inflationary with the Abitur, which is the german matura

2010-10-20T07:44:05  <Rommel> Well, it takes my PC 0.1s for about 60,000 iterations... I hardly think that is possible to do since it won't get that many examples anyway... unless we're working on a 100mhz or something haha
2010-10-20T07:46:54  <phreeza> Rommel: wouldn't you send in a pre-trained network anyway? what do you want to do with online training?
2010-10-20T07:47:35  <Rommel> true that phreeza, though it might be useful to do some extended epoch learning considering I may want it to eventually learn some of the other opponents

2010-10-20T07:51:50  <antimatroid> then run minimax on it
2010-10-20T07:52:20  <antimatroid> although current version is no longer choosing moves for player 2 untill terminal nodes where it "runs games" and does player 1's turns individually
2010-10-20T07:52:49  <Rommel> oh... so your actually controlling the moves... ie playing, not AI?
2010-10-20T07:52:57  <Rommel> Or a mix
2010-10-20T07:52:58  <Rommel> ?
2010-10-20T07:53:15  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2010-10-20T07:53:24  <antimatroid> any bot is going to need to be told what moves are possible
2010-10-20T07:53:30  <Rommel> "tree as in players pick moves at each node"
2010-10-20T07:53:37  <Rommel> Im guessing you don't mean real time
2010-10-20T07:53:37  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-10-20T07:53:57  <antimatroid> i have functions to generate moves for each player given the current game state
2010-10-20T07:54:01  <antimatroid> each node has it's own gamestate
2010-10-20T07:54:26  <antimatroid> it's not working very well yet
2010-10-20T07:55:05  <antimatroid> but i think the winning bot is going to need to have a smart approach and one of the best heuristic appraoches backing it
2010-10-20T07:55:25  <antimatroid> it's not like tron where the payoff function was pretty easy to make and move splits were tiny

2010-10-20T07:56:28  <Rommel> I haven't got my head around the system yet to understand what you mean by the gamestate, nor the nodes, other than the obvious/english definitions..
2010-10-20T07:57:44  <antimatroid> i think it helped a lot doing the tron contest before this one
2010-10-20T07:58:59  <Rommel> Nor how if you modified your planetWars.cc, it wouldnt be classed as cheating? ... although on second look... it appears all the planetWars.cc and .h files provide is some basic functions for yourself... all the other variables etc are setup and given elsewhere?
2010-10-20T07:59:21  <Rommel> Yay for not having used non-isolated programs before... :)

2010-10-20T08:00:39  <antimatroid> Rommel: the starter packages are just there as a guide
2010-10-20T08:00:46  <antimatroid> you can write you own bot from scratch if you want
2010-10-20T08:01:05  <antimatroid> it's really just dealing with the engine by inputting and receving a string
2010-10-20T08:01:25  <phreeza> i read a rule somewhere about no threading but that will be hard to enforce i think, whit haskell and the like especially
2010-10-20T08:02:06  <antimatroid> you're allowed green threads whatever they are
2010-10-20T08:02:17  <antimatroid> otherwise that is meant to get you kicked out

2010-10-20T08:04:04  <antimatroid> i found out about the comp a few days before it opened, so i've had lots of time to wrap my head around things
2010-10-20T08:04:35  <antimatroid> yeah, mine is pretty much completely rewritten
2010-10-20T08:04:42  <antimatroid> everything became structs and public
2010-10-20T08:04:55  <Rommel> Why not OOP?
2010-10-20T08:05:11  <antimatroid> i follow the communist approach to programming
2010-10-20T08:05:14  <antimatroid> everything is public
2010-10-20T08:05:21  <Rommel> haha, way to be
2010-10-20T08:05:25  <p4p4> ;)
2010-10-20T08:05:33  <Rommel> but why structs... objects not doing it for you?
2010-10-20T08:05:47  <antimatroid> structs are objects except everything is public by default :P
2010-10-20T08:06:14  <p4p4> ... and you are the only user, anyway.
2010-10-20T08:06:29  <antimatroid> p4p4: that wouldn't ever stop me :P
2010-10-20T08:08:06  <Rommel> I haven't used structs in C++ yet haha, just been doing straight objects all this time... I did them in C, not sure if they are any different?
2010-10-20T08:08:35  <antimatroid> same deal pretty sure
2010-10-20T08:09:08  <Rommel> Then why not just Objects anyway? Same thing, but possibility for constructors etc? Easier to manager surely? Esp. with the ability to have functions etc?

2010-10-20T08:09:20  <antimatroid> i wouldn't personally take advice from me about technicalities with programming though
2010-10-20T08:09:32  <Rommel> I'm not, just curious if theres a reason :P

2010-10-20T08:10:50  <antimatroid> structs can have functions etc.
2010-10-20T08:11:04  <antimatroid> there is literally no difference other than I don't have to write public: for a struct
2010-10-20T08:11:23  <Rommel> Ah... something that appears to be new in C++ for structs
2010-10-20T08:11:30  <Rommel> AFAIK in C you couldnt put functions in structs
2010-10-20T08:11:43  <antimatroid> ah, well i only ever use c++ :P
2010-10-20T08:11:48  <Rommel> Any yeah upon Google searching around... "A struct in C++ is exactly the same as a class, except by default all of the members of a struct are public."
2010-10-20T08:11:55  <antimatroid> but i plan to learn haskell and python at some point
2010-10-20T08:11:57  <Rommel> And*
2010-10-20T08:12:02  <antimatroid> and i very much irrationally hate java
2010-10-20T08:12:35  <Rommel> it has its uses
2010-10-20T08:12:55  <antimatroid> i don't understand how people can call c++ complicated while using java, imo c++ is way easier to learn
2010-10-20T08:15:15  <Rommel> What level of education you @ antima?
2010-10-20T08:15:26  <antimatroid> final year undergrad

2010-10-20T08:15:34  <Error323> java is way easier
2010-10-20T08:15:53  <antimatroid> no it's not, in c++ if i want to access elements of a string, myString[elementNo] bang
2010-10-20T08:15:58  <Rommel> lies error... I hate Java; myself: 1st year undergrad
2010-10-20T08:16:16  <antimatroid> i want a matrix or graph, vector<vector<valuetype> > myStuff;

2010-10-20T09:19:53  <antimatroid> nope
2010-10-20T09:19:57  <bhasker> is it running on tcp
2010-10-20T09:19:58  <bhasker> ?
2010-10-20T09:19:59  <antimatroid> i have used it before though
2010-10-20T09:20:00  <antimatroid> nope
2010-10-20T09:20:06  <bhasker> ah k
2010-10-20T09:20:10  <antimatroid> i haven't run it since this morning when i used antimatroid
2010-10-20T09:20:20  <antimatroid> i use either antimatroid or youwillfail usually
2010-10-20T09:20:35  <antimatroid> or something else if i don't want people to know who i am (used too many usernames that day already)
2010-10-20T09:21:54  <antimatroid> do we know who CCF is yet?
2010-10-20T09:22:15  <antimatroid> i wasn't even that intrigued until people kept asking, now i'm curious
2010-10-20T09:22:22  <bhasker> nope no idea
2010-10-20T09:22:27  <bhasker> its a good bot though
2010-10-20T09:22:28  <fluffluff> running different bots under the same name seems kinda bad for the rating system, assuming it's within a 24h period that is
2010-10-20T09:22:34  <antimatroid> i beat that earlier
2010-10-20T09:23:04  <fluffluff> I think I read here once that felixcoto(?) is cccf
2010-10-20T09:23:42  <bhasker> flufffluff i guess fluff_21_0.9s is yours?
2010-10-20T09:24:08  <fluffluff> yeah
2010-10-20T09:24:14  <bhasker> ah k
2010-10-20T09:24:21  <bhasker> so youwillfail is yours antimatroid
2010-10-20T09:24:30  <antimatroid> yep
2010-10-20T09:24:34  <bhasker> it was a good bot though haven't seen it in quite sometime
2010-10-20T09:24:44  <bhasker> my last submission on official server is upto rank #47
2010-10-20T09:24:47  <antimatroid> yeah, it's not amazing atm
2010-10-20T09:24:54  <antimatroid> i'm in the thirties somewhere
2010-10-20T09:24:55  <bhasker> but the number of games is so low though:-\
2010-10-20T09:24:59  <antimatroid> i want top 10 at least
2010-10-20T09:25:59  <bhasker> don't we all
2010-10-20T09:26:03  *** p4p4 <p4p4!~chatzilla@82.113.106.28> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection timed out)
2010-10-20T09:26:13  <bhasker> yea but i doubt i will make it there
2010-10-20T09:26:18  <bhasker> i think i can make it to top 30 maybe
2010-10-20T09:27:03  <fluffluff> I keep having timeout issues on the offical server :| I sent in a version the other day with a time cap of 0.01s. that one got to play 9 games without problems. 0.4s on the other hand died on the first game after 9 turns. lowering that to 0.1s made it last 21 turns on the first game

2010-10-20T09:28:18  <bhasker> lol http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=588702
2010-10-20T09:28:27  <bhasker> don't know why the other bot never reacted
2010-10-20T09:28:32  <antimatroid> i got disqualified last tournament with a bot that should have finished top 15 most likely 10, so i have a point to prove :P
2010-10-20T09:28:40  <bhasker> disqualified?
2010-10-20T09:28:42  <bhasker> why?
2010-10-20T09:28:53  <antimatroid> exceeding time limit on one turn in one game
2010-10-20T09:29:03  <antimatroid> stupidest rule ever, after much petitioning it's been changed this time
2010-10-20T09:29:24  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-20T09:29:40  <bhasker> that is a stupid rule
2010-10-20T09:29:49  <antimatroid> i didn't even know that was the rule till it happened
2010-10-20T09:29:52  <antimatroid> was incredibly annoying
2010-10-20T09:30:18  <fluffluff> is anyone running time intensive bots without problems on the official server?
2010-10-20T09:30:35  <antimatroid> biggest let down, and then when people who have no idea wtf you did ask you how you went and you say you got disqualified, they grill you so bad
2010-10-20T09:30:38  <bhasker> my bot barely takes anytime
2010-10-20T09:30:49  <antimatroid> i haven't uploaded my tree bot there yet
2010-10-20T09:30:56  <antimatroid> it's still too shit

2010-10-20T09:31:17  <bhasker> since i don't do any tree searches
2010-10-20T09:31:22  *** Arthur <Arthur!~Arthur@203-100-216-90.callplus.net.nz> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-20T09:31:26  <bhasker> and i abuse priority queues
2010-10-20T09:31:33  <antimatroid> you would hope to be using almost nothing if you plan to use a tree later
2010-10-20T09:31:42  <antimatroid> priority queues and overloading < are my best friend
2010-10-20T09:31:54  <fluffluff> bhask: what's your name on tcp?
2010-10-20T09:31:57  <bhasker> malazan
2010-10-20T09:32:07  <bhasker> was playing my original versions with my name
2010-10-20T09:32:12  <bhasker> but when i rewrote it switched the name
2010-10-20T09:33:20  <bhasker> i wish more people would run their bots on tcp
2010-10-20T09:33:22  <bhasker> all the time
2010-10-20T09:33:29  <bhasker> i can never figure how good my bot is doing
2010-10-20T09:33:44  <fluffluff> yeah, tcp rocks
2010-10-20T09:33:56  <antimatroid> sorry, i should do that, next time i get a decent bot i will run a bat file indefinitely
2010-10-20T09:34:22  <antimatroid> i often just run it as i'm fixing things
2010-10-20T09:34:39  <antimatroid> as how it does against my past revisions isn't always a great indication of how it will do against other bots
2010-10-20T09:34:51  <bhasker> yea my current bot destroys my older bots
2010-10-20T09:34:57  <bhasker> but doesn't do that much better against other bots
2010-10-20T09:34:57  <antimatroid> unlike tron where you could literally debug why you lost, it's not so easy to work out in this why you lost
2010-10-20T09:35:30  *** Titankiller <Titankiller!~titankill@111.92.8.149> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-10-20T09:35:39  <bhasker> actually figuring out reason for loss isnt that hard
2010-10-20T09:35:46  <bhasker> its usually 2-3 things
2010-10-20T09:35:49  <bhasker> a) the start was bad
2010-10-20T09:35:55  <bhasker> b) you picked the wrong neutral
2010-10-20T09:36:09  <bhasker> c) you picked the right neutral at the wrong time
2010-10-20T09:36:20  <bhasker> d) you forgot to defend something ^
2010-10-20T09:37:13  <bhasker> so one rule that i have added that seems to do wonders
2010-10-20T09:37:23  <bhasker> when even or ahead don't attack any neutrals
2010-10-20T09:37:30  <bhasker> just sit
2010-10-20T09:37:35  <bhasker> you win by inaction
2010-10-20T09:37:41  <bhasker> or if enemy attacsk you snipe
2010-10-20T09:38:11  <bhasker> my bot now doesn't stupidly keep trying to expand
2010-10-20T09:38:30  <antimatroid> yeah, i've added in variables for the expected final growth counts of each player
2010-10-20T09:38:34  <phreeza> bhasker: i think some bots also look ahead and see if they can be sniped, and don't attack neutrals if that is the case
2010-10-20T09:38:39  <phreeza> leading to things like this
2010-10-20T09:38:41  <phreeza> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5952104
2010-10-20T09:38:41  <antimatroid> and make the decision to expand based off of that
2010-10-20T09:38:55  <fluffluff> seems like I could use some of that... I'm expanding pretty much nonstop
2010-10-20T09:39:03  <bhasker> yup happens with my bot too phreeza
2010-10-20T09:39:09  <bhasker> fluff another rule
2010-10-20T09:39:15  <bhasker> if ahead in production but low on ships
2010-10-20T09:39:18  <antimatroid> dmj taught me not to expand too much
2010-10-20T09:39:18  <bhasker> never attack anything
2010-10-20T09:39:25  <antimatroid> by repeatedly crushing me in under 100 turns
2010-10-20T09:39:28  <bhasker> if you have less ships than enemy
2010-10-20T09:39:31  <bhasker> never attack anything
2010-10-20T09:39:40  <bhasker> case in point http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=588825
2010-10-20T09:39:44  <bhasker> i win this game by inaction
2010-10-20T09:39:48  <bhasker> i was even but ahead in ships
2010-10-20T09:40:02  <bhasker> won the game by 14 ships ^
2010-10-20T09:41:04  <fluffluff> hehe, sweet
2010-10-20T09:41:11  <antimatroid> i find my bot chooses to do nothing too often when i allow it the option :|
2010-10-20T09:41:29  <antimatroid> i guess it sees too many awesome future moves that no longer remain possible
2010-10-20T09:41:30  <bhasker> well i added a few things
2010-10-20T09:41:34  <bhasker> i expand if enemy expands
2010-10-20T09:41:40  <bhasker> to maintain my advantage
2010-10-20T09:42:11  <bhasker> and i snipe enemy planets if he moves his ships away from a planet close to me
2010-10-20T09:42:26  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=588857
2010-10-20T09:42:30  <bhasker> another game draw this time
2010-10-20T09:43:42  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@130.232.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-10-20T09:44:46  <antimatroid> bhasker: i'ma put current bot up even though it's not very good
2010-10-20T09:44:54  <antimatroid> cause i'm going to make some large changes again
2010-10-20T09:44:58  <phreeza> bhasker: and do you think this is ideal? i can't see any obvious move to win that
2010-10-20T09:45:07  <phreeza> so maybe it is
2010-10-20T09:45:19  <phreeza> which might mean all the top bots will end up drawing? :D
2010-10-20T09:45:32  <antimatroid> great, it plays me against bocsimacko right away
2010-10-20T09:45:39  <antimatroid> that's going to hurt
2010-10-20T09:46:00  <bhasker> yea i think its ideal
2010-10-20T09:46:04  <bhasker> not to do anything
2010-10-20T09:46:12  <bhasker> shifting 60-70 ships from front
2010-10-20T09:46:16  <bhasker> could cause an immediate attack
2010-10-20T09:46:25  <bhasker> so its best not to do anything

2010-10-20T09:49:24  <bhasker> ooh k
2010-10-20T09:49:37  <bhasker> i tried to do no staging
2010-10-20T09:49:41  <bhasker> but my bot does horrible lol
2010-10-20T09:49:45  <bhasker> if i remove my staging code
2010-10-20T09:49:47  <mega1> ha, defeated dmj
2010-10-20T09:50:03  <mega1> bhasker: I think staging is crucial
2010-10-20T09:50:09  <bhasker> do you watch the games live using the viewer
2010-10-20T09:50:13  <mega1> no
2010-10-20T09:50:18  <bhasker> ah just following logs?
2010-10-20T09:50:39  <bhasker> yea staging is needed, except i can't figure out when to stop sending to front sometimes
2010-10-20T09:50:50  <mega1> yeah and checking out interesting games once they appear on the server
2010-10-20T09:50:54  <bhasker> enemy will be taking a planet near the back or i will lose some back planets
2010-10-20T09:51:09  <bhasker> and it takes a long time for my bot to realize that it has a threat at its back
2010-10-20T09:51:15  <bhasker> and it loses a bunch of planets in a short time
2010-10-20T09:51:34  <bhasker> trying to balance for that
2010-10-20T09:51:36  <bhasker> is a pain

2010-10-20T09:53:56  <bhasker> thats what put him behind
2010-10-20T09:54:10  <mega1> just realized that I had too many processes running
2010-10-20T09:54:23  <bhasker> looks like we have a match antimatroid
2010-10-20T09:54:26  <mega1> and my bots weren't able to finish thinking
2010-10-20T09:54:44  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-20T09:55:38  <antimatroid> if this bot keeps it up its going to get a nice rank boost once the old games expire aha
2010-10-20T09:55:58  <mega1> upon review I don't think that was the reason it lost

2010-10-20T09:57:49  <antimatroid> i had a punctured tyre on my bike today, was very annoying
2010-10-20T09:58:23  <antimatroid> i also took a trip over my handlebars yesterday aha
2010-10-20T09:58:34  <bhasker> i will win this one too antimatroid unless my bot goes stupid
2010-10-20T09:58:38  <antimatroid> i went riding down some dirt tracks nearby and decided to stop when i shouldn't have
2010-10-20T09:58:53  <foucist> antimatroid: ouch, you puncture the tire at the same time?
2010-10-20T09:58:59  <bhasker> ouch trip over the handlebar
2010-10-20T09:59:03  <bhasker> that must have hurt
2010-10-20T09:59:06  <antimatroid> foucist: i think it was just riding around on dirt tracks
2010-10-20T09:59:23  <antimatroid> it's more of a cross between a road bike and a mountain bike and really shouldn't have been taken where it was
2010-10-20T09:59:53  <antimatroid> didn't hurt so was all good, last time i went over the handlebars of a bike i broke my shoulder and didn't go to the doctor for a week, family gave me a fair bit of shit about that one
2010-10-20T10:00:00  <foucist> antimatroid: one time i was riding in the rain, my foot slipped off the pedal, and i hit an embankment and went flying over, and the bike actually ended up twisted up a bit, i took it to a shop and they thought a car must've hit me
2010-10-20T10:00:14  <antimatroid> i was shifting gears in my car with my right arm (you drive on the right side of the car in australia)

2010-10-20T11:42:45  <delt0r___> antimatroid: I think its related to the very low number of games

2010-10-20T11:43:14  <cfaftw> antimatroid, yes. "deserved". O:)
2010-10-20T11:43:16  <delt0r___> and the quite high server load causing the better bots to loose to poor bots every now and then with timeouts

2010-10-20T11:46:55  <cfaftw> i think it goes back to the problem of game history being tied to user accounts and not specific submissions

2010-10-20T12:10:44  <dmj111> too much.  a lot of it is in dead-end branches in hg.

2010-10-20T12:10:47  <janzert> probably connection dropping and getting reconnected while the old nick is still in use and your client automatically uses ` to create a new nick
2010-10-20T12:11:39  <dmj111> Ahh... I have done more irc'ing in the last 5 weeks than I have for the rest of my life.
2010-10-20T12:12:03  <gerald512k> thats cool hardcore geek coder player :D
2010-10-20T12:12:29  <dmj111> antimatroid: if I cannot get my new bot to do what I want, I may go back and try to add more heuristics to the official version.
2010-10-20T12:12:55  <antimatroid> i've actually just rethought a lot of my decisions on moves in the last hour or two
2010-10-20T12:13:00  <antimatroid> currently working on implementing it
2010-10-20T12:13:20  <gerald512k> coding my bot learns me java language effectively and in a funny way very that is why i spend a lot of time n it.
2010-10-20T12:13:27  <janzert> it's more common for clients to use _, but emacs? yeah that's not surprising :P

2010-10-20T12:17:47  <JamesMG> I've been thinking about building a server for stuff like that after the competition
2010-10-20T12:17:54  <antimatroid> ie. if one doesn't expand, the other two want to take them out before fighting, but who takes them out first?
2010-10-20T12:17:56  <JamesMG> we'll see if there is still interest at that point though
2010-10-20T12:18:07  <antimatroid> if you do it too fast the other player will take you both out

2010-10-20T12:34:52  <cfaftw> i guess i'll just work on my bot...  :(
2010-10-20T12:35:25  <JamesMG> I should get back on minecraft, he has to have fixed some stuff in multi by now...
2010-10-20T12:35:44  <cfaftw> jamesmg, best to wait till oct 31... there's a big patch coming
2010-10-20T12:35:55  <JamesMG> ah, ok
2010-10-20T12:36:13  <JamesMG> last time I played minecarts, buckets and furnaces were all broken

2010-10-20T12:36:37  <cfaftw> and you can't place lava or water

2010-10-20T12:37:42  <JamesMG> bummer, that supposed to be in the oct 31 patch?
2010-10-20T12:38:02  <cfaftw> eh... that's what everyone is hoping
2010-10-20T12:38:08  <gerald512k> phreeza i think yes, but no sure that bot support it :D
2010-10-20T12:38:34  <phreeza> i'm so happy i haven't gotten into minecraft
2010-10-20T12:38:35  <JamesMG> I was hoping he'd pseudo open source it at some point
2010-10-20T12:38:41  <cfaftw> i wish he'd focus on getting the existing content working in every mode before adding next content
2010-10-20T12:38:47  <cfaftw> next = new
2010-10-20T12:38:50  <phreeza> i wasted so much on dwarf fortress
2010-10-20T12:39:02  <gerald512k> i dont know minecraft but is seems to be a geek game :
2010-10-20T12:39:04  <JamesMG> I never did get into dwarf fortress thankfully
2010-10-20T12:39:06  <cfaftw> lol, phreeza i tried dwarf fortress but couldn't get into it
2010-10-20T12:39:16  <phreeza> once he's bought his island in the carribean he might
2010-10-20T12:39:33  <JamesMG> haha, he ever sort out his paypal problem?
2010-10-20T12:39:42  <JamesMG> last I heard they had a hold on about 600k euros
2010-10-20T12:39:42  <a1k0n> multiplayer minecraft has a bunch of sync issues in general, especially with chests
2010-10-20T12:39:43  <cfaftw> yeah, he actually hired a few software developers
2010-10-20T12:39:47  <cfaftw> they have a legit company now
2010-10-20T12:39:57  <phreeza> not sure, i think he did
2010-10-20T12:40:02  <a1k0n> all my iron disappeared and i was pissed so i figure out the mechanism and now i can dupe items ad infinitum
2010-10-20T12:40:20  <rebelxt> can someone give a one line "why is minecfact cool?" answer? i might try it after this contest is over ;)

2010-10-20T12:40:48  <a1k0n> well, all the other brokenness, esp re: monsters, makes it not fun anyway
2010-10-20T12:40:53  <cfaftw> although... i'm guilty of using the "repair" glitch.  drop busted diamond pick on ground, pick it up, brand new diamond pick
2010-10-20T12:41:03  <JamesMG> yeah cfaftw, I can't not do that
2010-10-20T12:41:05  <cfaftw> a1k0n, too true
2010-10-20T12:41:15  <a1k0n> i generally play single player, which is fun.  multiplayer, well, i just dick around and build things
2010-10-20T12:41:25  <rebelxt> scripted monsters? is this world of warcraft with lego mixed in?

2010-10-20T12:41:41  <cfaftw> the only reason i bought the game is because me and a few friends got it together... one of them hosts a server and we all create worlds together
2010-10-20T12:41:43  <cfaftw> it's awesome

2010-10-20T12:42:08  <JamesMG> all I do in it is create buildings and caves and explode TNT deposits to create craters etc
2010-10-20T12:42:19  <phreeza> haha
2010-10-20T12:42:36  <a1k0n> yes we duped a lot of TNT and blasted the shit out of our multiplayer map
2010-10-20T12:42:36  <cfaftw> you should build an underwater walkway
2010-10-20T12:42:46  <JamesMG> I just host a server for me and my friends to play on and do that kinda crap
2010-10-20T12:42:52  <rebelxt> cfaftw: your bot climbed to #2. cool!
2010-10-20T12:43:03  <JamesMG> cfaftw: when I discovered glass I made an underwater lab

2010-10-20T12:43:20  <gerald512k> too few games
2010-10-20T12:43:37  <cfaftw> jamesmg, nice... my next project is going to be an underwater biocube
2010-10-20T12:43:40  <gerald512k> i hope they will find new servers soon :(
2010-10-20T12:44:04  <foucist> cfaftw: what would you grow in the biocube?
2010-10-20T12:44:08  <foucist> is this like a hydroponics thing?

2010-10-20T12:45:41  <JamesMG> I can't make a waterfall out of a bucket of water in the real world :(

2010-10-20T12:58:34  <rebelxt> isn't it 2s? we looked at the code a few days ago...
2010-10-20T12:59:09  <mega1> engine.py?
2010-10-20T13:00:05  <HakanD> 1s for each turn, bots are given a startup time of 2s at start, but game state is given after that, than you have 1s to do your move
2010-10-20T13:01:00  <mega1> HakanD: thanks, I can see it now in the code.

2010-10-20T13:37:57  <rabidus_> i'm just getting compile errors of some basic functions... tried to install libbsd-dev packages and such..
2010-10-20T13:38:23  <rabidus_> currently expire.cpp hangs with function 'time' and function 'strlcpy'
2010-10-20T13:38:34  <dwchandler> hangs?
2010-10-20T13:38:42  <rabidus_> umm... makes an error :)
2010-10-20T13:38:59  <rabidus_> 'was not declared in this scope'
2010-10-20T13:39:04  <dwchandler> 'time' is surely just some different headers between bsd and linux
2010-10-20T13:39:41  <dwchandler> strlcpy isn't in normal glibc because drepper is a dork
2010-10-20T13:40:15  <dwchandler> you can convert to use strncpy, or snap the implementation of strlcpy from openbsd or elsewhere

2010-10-20T13:40:36  <rabidus_> yeah, including time.h fixed that time issue
2010-10-20T13:40:41  <rabidus_> hmm.. ok, i'll try

2010-10-20T14:12:49  <lavalamp_> gerald512k, basically I have the option to log to stderr, or to a file, and I can turn on logging for only a particular turn or planet. And, if playing on the tcp server, I can record all the incoming data to a file so I can replay it through my bot later to see what it did

2010-10-20T14:15:09  <lavalamp_> that's why I have the turn option, it doesn't print anything until it gets to that turn

2010-10-20T14:23:40  <Frontier> lavalamp_: I gave my bot an explain command line option that logs detailed messages for a particular turn to stderr. Looks like a lot of people have the same ideas here.

2010-10-20T14:25:24  <lavalamp_> RageBot is actually a good test case
2010-10-20T14:25:28  <Frontier> Hopefully on a map with a large gap between the starting planets ^^
2010-10-20T14:25:56  <Sarin> sometimes i get draw againt ragebot :(
2010-10-20T14:26:00  <p4p4> but ragebot got a surprisingly good elo
2010-10-20T14:27:04  <lavalamp_> it's because people don't do the "how many ships can I send and not lose my planet" math
2010-10-20T14:27:38  <lavalamp_> which is ridiculously easy to do
2010-10-20T14:27:41  <antimatroid> damn, i just got completely ruined by the way neutral clashes are handled
2010-10-20T14:28:00  <Frontier> I think I need to collect some 'character' info on my opponent. RageBot would be 100% aggressive for example which in turn means I can snipe neutrals wherever I want.
2010-10-20T14:29:14  <ger512kAFK> my firt bot was like ragebot. (if i had mode ships then enemy, i attack with all my planets all his weakest planet, else expand) Was 20 line and go rank 400 very fast
2010-10-20T14:29:15  <Frontier> antimatroid: It is easy - the difference of the two largest fleets is the remaining fleet on the planet. If it is other than 0 the planet changes ownership.
2010-10-20T14:29:17  <lavalamp_> if I get it working, my new bot will eventually compare what they did with what I thought they would do, and use that to know how well I'm predicting its moves

2010-10-20T14:30:16  <antimatroid> it's when i want to do other things that it complicates thing
2010-10-20T14:31:15  <lavalamp_> I had departures leaving planets at the wrong time which forced me to rewrite some things this morning
2010-10-20T14:31:18  <Frontier> antimatroid: I don't understand you. What does the number of neutral planets have to do with a single battle on a planet?
2010-10-20T14:31:33  <antimatroid> neutral ships**
2010-10-20T14:31:53  <antimatroid> oh wait, that might work
2010-10-20T14:32:16  <Frontier> so?... largest fleet is neutral - incoming fleet = x remaining neutral, owner changes to ... tada: neutral
2010-10-20T14:32:48  <antimatroid> still doesn't fix me having to store more data for what i want to do though
2010-10-20T14:33:21  <lavalamp_> hm... if player a and b both send 20 ships to a 10 ship neutral, what happens? It's left with 0 ships and still neutral?
2010-10-20T14:33:33  <antimatroid> yep
2010-10-20T14:33:42  <lavalamp_> I'm pretty sure that's what my code does
2010-10-20T14:33:56  <antimatroid> there are basically 3 ways it could have been done, none were obviously the best choice, so a decision was made
2010-10-20T14:34:04  <Frontier> maybe... I just handle the present ships on the planet as an addition to the owners 'incoming' fleets on that turn and do the math with just the total ship counts for each player

2010-10-20T14:37:36  <Frontier> I lost my drive a while back. Calculating how many enemy ships might potentially attack a single planet over the course of x turns is really not trivial. Not only is there growth and fleets in transit, but also neutrals beeing captured mean time or worst scenario of all:
2010-10-20T14:38:54  <Frontier> I might capture an enemy planet if he doesn't defend it which would change the amount of ships the enemy could send from turn n on. Then again, if he defends that will reduce the amount of ships at first (for the defense) but give him more ships after the attack.
2010-10-20T14:39:44  <lavalamp_> my first bot did that in two steps
2010-10-20T14:39:52  <lavalamp_> 1. handle fleets in transit
2010-10-20T14:40:06  <lavalamp_> 2. do all that complicated stuff
2010-10-20T14:40:14  <Frontier> So you end up either ignoring these cases, calculating an absolute maximum for each round or try to predict if the enemy defends or not and go with that.
2010-10-20T14:40:35  <lavalamp_> I missed the case where he captures a neutral first in that bot
2010-10-20T14:41:01  <lavalamp_> the other cases I think I handled pretty well
2010-10-20T14:41:05  <Frontier> lavalamp_: I do that too. The point is, I cannot be sure I will actually CAPTURE a certain planet. The enemy could send reinforcements in time.

2010-10-20T14:42:44  <Frontier> Imagine my fleet is 5 turns away and he has a planet with reinfocements ready in a distance of 3 turns. Your bot would believe that it captures the enemy planet while it is 95% certain it wont due to the nearby reinforcements
2010-10-20T14:43:07  <lavalamp_> oh no I take into account nearby reinforcements

2010-10-20T14:43:27  <Frontier> oh that's cool :)
2010-10-20T14:44:12  <lavalamp_> yeah... unless those reinforcements are coming from a neutral he hasn't captured yet
2010-10-20T14:45:12  <Frontier> Ok, but that is the same story. I have seen that often: An advanced bot sends enough ships to capture 3 planets to just one neutral and goes from there.
2010-10-20T14:45:15  <p4p4> wait, neutrals aren't sending stuff, are they ?
2010-10-20T14:45:39  <Frontier> p4p4: Hell no. We are talking about advanced predictions.

2010-10-20T14:48:51  <a1k0n> it also isn't a lot different
2010-10-20T14:49:08  <Frontier> lavalamp_: If we do the obvious stuff in phase 1 (i.e. fleets in transit) and the complicated stuff in phase 2 we still have a bot which doesn't behave right in some situations that a human would easily realize.
2010-10-20T14:49:25  <lavalamp_> yes
2010-10-20T14:49:37  <lavalamp_> Which is why my current bot is different
2010-10-20T14:49:37  <JamesMG> a1k0n: it just beat my dev code
2010-10-20T14:49:58  <a1k0n> i saw, heh
2010-10-20T14:50:48  <lavalamp_> To do the heuristics right you sorta have to consider everything all at once
2010-10-20T14:51:44  <Frontier> lavalamp_: What do you do differently? I think about some iterative approach, but I have to be aware of possible deadlocks if I say: "I don't know if the enemy can hold planet 1, let's predict planet 2 first which could send reinforcements. Ok planet 2 depends on 1 again... deadlock" ^^

2010-10-20T14:56:01  <a1k0n> it knew it was going to lose because it did something unimaginably stupid
2010-10-20T14:56:06  <Zannick> ....quite
2010-10-20T14:56:21  <a1k0n> because it thought its opponent was going to do something just as dumb.  i guess it plays better with that turned off
2010-10-20T14:56:34  <lavalamp_> wow, that's quite the first move
2010-10-20T14:56:44  <Frontier> er... so you wrote a fail bot and wonder how it can predict its loss? ^^
2010-10-20T14:57:10  <a1k0n> well, it seems to have failed to hit the global maximum on the first turn, put it that way
2010-10-20T14:57:11  <Zannick> the problem with minimax/alphabeta is you generally have to assume the opponent will do what you would do
2010-10-20T14:58:04  <antimatroid> i'm actually getting quite a lot of success with my current tree approach
2010-10-20T14:58:28  <lavalamp_> I have some plans to take care of that, including simulating e.g. ragebot as an opponent
2010-10-20T14:58:38  <Frontier> So far I choose planets only factored by enemy distance, my distance, growth, ships... stuff like that. No knapsack, no maximin.

2010-10-20T15:18:47  <gerald512kk> ok i see lavalamp this semm very good
2010-10-20T15:18:49  <rabidus_> you are on your 3rd minute!
2010-10-20T15:18:53  <rabidus_> ;)
2010-10-20T15:19:05  <gerald512kk> haha sory so i shut up :(
2010-10-20T15:19:12  <rabidus_> haha no, go on
2010-10-20T15:19:17  <gerald512kk> lol:)
2010-10-20T15:19:23  <rabidus_> i was just joking
2010-10-20T15:19:47  <Spike_007> do you know, why (after copying starting java package) into NetBeans as new project, there are missing package statements at the beggining of each *.java file ???
2010-10-20T15:19:59  <gerald512kk> i dont wanna flood the chanel but i am really stuck. I dont know how to create pw.Myplanets().size() lists :(
2010-10-20T15:20:10  <Migi32> sorry I was distracted. So let me rephrase my question as "has anyone found a situation in PlanetWars where the best move was a "mixed strategy", which involves probabilities (like in rock-paper-scissors, where the best move is pick any with 33% probability each)?"
2010-10-20T15:20:12  <Spike_007> it's not exactly NB problem, but still, that statement is required as far as I know
2010-10-20T15:21:09  <Migi32> so RPS or RPS-like things
2010-10-20T15:21:24  <Zannick> Spike_007: it's only required for actual packages, i think
2010-10-20T15:21:31  <Zannick> which is what netbeans is assuming
2010-10-20T15:21:40  <Migi32> might be rock paper scissors lizard spock :P
2010-10-20T15:22:01  <lavalamp_> Sorry, gerald, don't know java well enough to comment... if you google "java list" or something like that I bet you'd find something
2010-10-20T15:22:31  <Zannick> gerald512kk: ArrayList will let you do adjustable size
2010-10-20T15:22:36  <Spike_007> oh, thx :) I've never worked with java via cmd line (shame on me, I know) so it took my by surprise ...
2010-10-20T15:22:50  <gerald512kk> ok yes i gonna use it tyvm!
2010-10-20T15:23:08  <Zannick> i forget if you can do arrays like that. String[] = new String[pw.MyPlanets().size()];
2010-10-20T15:23:14  <lavalamp_> Migi32: if/when my bot finds one I will be posting it somewhere :)

2010-10-20T15:38:58  <Migi32> preeza: ah ok but it wasn't perfect
2010-10-20T15:38:58  <Migi32> <McLeopold> attack beats neutral, neutral beats hold, hold sucks...
2010-10-20T15:39:03  <Migi32> <McLeopold> That's why I need a neutral, so that holding can beat an attack.
2010-10-20T15:39:33  <Migi32> hold will never beat attack
2010-10-20T15:39:37  <Migi32> only draw
2010-10-20T15:39:57  <Migi32> which makes the perfect strategy a RageBot
2010-10-20T15:44:05  <Spike_007> can anyone help me woth integration sources into NetBeans please ?
2010-10-20T15:44:05  <Migi32> perhaps there is a RPS like this: attack beats expand fast, expand fast beats expand slow, expand slow beats attack?
2010-10-20T15:44:06  <Migi32> but that'd require at least 6 planets and is probably too complex for humans to analyse
2010-10-20T15:44:06  <Migi32> or 5, but still

2010-10-20T15:44:35  <Migi32> ok
2010-10-20T15:45:19  <Frontier> Migi32: see, for you I would have calculated different probabilities of course. It is all about estimating from other peoples forst moves.
2010-10-20T15:46:03  <Migi32> well for c++ I just imported the sources as a regular project because it just requires command-line input and output (std::cin and std::cout)
2010-10-20T15:46:08  <Spike_007> I've some error alerts in NetBeans, probably because 'package ...' statement is missing in the beggining of each file (or I've somehow screwed integration)
2010-10-20T15:46:12  <Frontier> If he was familiar with C++ in NetBeans that would raise the probability that he ever had to import sources into the IDE thus reducing the probability of his question. It's like RageBot or not RageBot.
2010-10-20T15:46:41  <Migi32> Spike_007, java needs no "package ..." afaik
2010-10-20T15:46:52  <Frontier> Spike_007: That is ok. The usage of the default package is stongly discouraged, you can disable the warnings though
2010-10-20T15:47:01  <Spike_007> agree, still, no idea where errors are from ..

2010-10-20T15:51:15  <javagamer> McLeopold, that's a brilliant idea for displacing distances, I never considered a table
2010-10-20T15:51:36  <phreeza> McLeopold: starting planets are 0 and 1?
2010-10-20T15:51:48  <McLeopold> It's not a normal start
2010-10-20T15:52:01  <McLeopold> It's just a scenario
2010-10-20T15:52:18  <phreeza> ok but 2 is neutral?
2010-10-20T15:52:23  <Migi32> McLeopold, a triangular matrix would make sense but your distance table doesn't
2010-10-20T15:52:23  <phreeza> ah no ok
2010-10-20T15:52:30  <lavalamp_> no neutrals
2010-10-20T15:52:43  <phreeza> i missed the specs before
2010-10-20T15:52:43  <McLeopold> Player 1 has two planets, and technically enough ships and growth to hold, but only if he can guess player 2's first turn.
2010-10-20T15:52:53  <phreeza> very cool
2010-10-20T15:53:01  <Migi32> McLeopold, what if he attacks player 2?

2010-10-20T15:54:49  <McLeopold> Migi32: where are the holes?
2010-10-20T15:54:56  <Frontier> Migi32: I agree, a triangular matrix makes sense :)
2010-10-20T15:55:10  <Migi32> McLeopold, I see this:

2010-10-20T15:57:53  <phreeza> player 2, sorry
2010-10-20T15:58:00  <McLeopold> Image that scenario on the map twice with the places reversed.  If you solve your side before the opponent does, you capture that side and send ships to the other.
2010-10-20T15:58:15  <McLeopold> phreeze: everything is an option
2010-10-20T15:58:45  <phreeza> but can he capture it? i think not?
2010-10-20T15:58:52  <McLeopold> no
2010-10-20T15:59:02  <McLeopold> unless player 2 sends everything
2010-10-20T16:00:33  <Migi32> McLeopold, you can also wait until player 2 attacks, then counter-attack his main
2010-10-20T16:00:47  <McLeopold> actually...I think I messed up the ship counts...

2010-10-20T16:15:48  <Frontier> honestly I use a struct for that purpose, too. even worse i have a struct that consists of a turn number AND a struct of owner and ship count
2010-10-20T16:15:51  <Migi32> typedef std::pair<int, int> YourPair
2010-10-20T16:16:20  <Migi32> or FutureInt or whatever it means
2010-10-20T16:16:26  <lavalamp_> yeah, it's just that "first" and "second" are a lot more confusing than "ships" and "owner"
2010-10-20T16:16:45  <Migi32> so make a struct :P
2010-10-20T16:17:25  <Frontier> Migi32: That still happens to me a lot. I often write functions that return a vector& but I store it in a new vector object copying all the elements just because I forgot that ampers-and
2010-10-20T16:18:21  <jmcarthur> in C the usual thing to do would be to save return values for status codes and pass actual results via pointer parameters. not saying it's pretty, but it's really the "best" way to go about it in C most of the time. C++ has a few more options, but whether they are better, i don't know
2010-10-20T16:18:50  <jmcarthur> wait, it copies the elements by default? ew
2010-10-20T16:19:03  <Migi32> Frontier, I think you're using getters and setters too much ;)
2010-10-20T16:19:17  <jmcarthur> i guess vectors aren't immutable so it makes sense but... yuck :)
2010-10-20T16:19:45  <lavalamp_> yeah don't misuse that...
2010-10-20T16:21:01  <jmcarthur> i haven't worked on my bot in like a week
2010-10-20T16:21:24  <javagamer> Considering I probably will use this all over I guess I'll make a struct, but good to know std::pair exists
2010-10-20T16:21:50  <Frontier> Migi32: I like how you can return a const vector&. That allows you to get right at the source of an objects data without the danger of changing anything without the object knowing
2010-10-20T16:21:50  <Migi32> jmcarthur, sorry I keep defending c++ but the & that Frontier talked about changes that default behavior
2010-10-20T16:21:56  <jmcarthur> Migi32: i know
2010-10-20T16:22:08  <jmcarthur> but only because it's pass by reference
2010-10-20T16:22:37  <jmcarthur> my intuition would have been that the underlying array shouldn't be copied anyway, but that's because my mind makes the incorrect assumption that std::vector is immutable
2010-10-20T16:22:45  <Migi32> but I definitely agree that in c++ you can end up with hidden, sneaky copies
2010-10-20T16:22:46  <lavalamp_> c++ makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot in a lot of ways I appreciate more since starting to write things in go
2010-10-20T16:23:30  <McLeopold> python lets you shoot yourself in the foot, but only with rubber bullets
2010-10-20T16:23:30  <Migi32> I really want to check out go
2010-10-20T16:23:37  <Zannick> McLeopold: :D
2010-10-20T16:23:41  <Migi32> I read about go's features and I liked almost everything
2010-10-20T16:23:42  * jmcarthur goes back to his haskell projects
2010-10-20T16:23:56  * boegel joins jmc
2010-10-20T16:24:02  <Zannick> in C you can shoot yourself in the foot, but you have to disable all the safeties
2010-10-20T16:24:04  * boegel joins jmcarthur
2010-10-20T16:24:14  <lavalamp_> I love it, but it needs some sort of generics before it will be mainstream
2010-10-20T16:24:27  <lavalamp_> that's basically my only complaint
2010-10-20T16:24:27  <Zannick> by which i mean, it's only a little harder to do than in c++
2010-10-20T16:24:48  <jmcarthur> i kind of disagree with the direction of that metaphor
2010-10-20T16:24:49  <lavalamp_> yeah you can't accidentally copy a vector in C ;)
2010-10-20T16:25:00  <Zannick> really? most people i talk to about c++ or java, templates/generics are the most depised things
2010-10-20T16:25:20  <jmcarthur> in C you can take aim at whatever you want and fire directly at the target, including your foot. in C++ you don't necessarily know what you're aiming at
2010-10-20T16:25:23  <Migi32> lavalamp_, no generics? :(
2010-10-20T16:25:23  <Zannick> you can't accidentally copy an array in C
2010-10-20T16:25:35  <Zannick> if you pass it as an argument, it returns a pointer
2010-10-20T16:25:36  <lavalamp_> Well, I have the same 4 lines of code copied for a bunch of different structs, it gets old
2010-10-20T16:25:43  <Zannick> er, it passes a pointer
2010-10-20T16:25:45  <lavalamp_> Migi32, not yet, it's on their lits
2010-10-20T16:25:48  <lavalamp_> *list
2010-10-20T16:26:04  <Zannick> of course, this means you can do silly things like declare an array in a function and attempt to return it
2010-10-20T16:26:19  <Zannick> this is one way to shoot yourself in the foot
2010-10-20T16:26:29  <Spike_007> is anyone here using Java + NetBeans ?
2010-10-20T16:27:32  <jmcarthur> Zannick: you can copy an array in C if it's a struct member, but that's presumably what you want to happen anyway if it's a struct member
2010-10-20T16:27:46  <lavalamp_> Zannick, I don't know about Java but templates in C++ are obscenely complicated, the go authors will not do it that way
2010-10-20T16:27:52  <jmcarthur> that is, if you pass the struct as a parameter
2010-10-20T16:28:06  <Zannick> oh right, structs will be passed in full
2010-10-20T16:28:06  <Migi32> also garbage collection. I'm still a big fan of RAII and manually deleting things
2010-10-20T16:28:19  <Zannick> but that's only if the entire array is in the struct, and not a pointer
2010-10-20T16:28:26  <jmcarthur> and in fact, you usually want to pass a large struct by reference, not by value
2010-10-20T16:28:32  <Zannick> i use pointers because my arrays aren't constant-length
2010-10-20T16:28:33  <jmcarthur> whether it has arrays or not
2010-10-20T16:28:33  <Migi32> Zannick, yes only fixed size arrays
2010-10-20T16:28:41  <Zannick> yes
2010-10-20T16:28:42  <lavalamp_> Migi32: I used to agree, but garbage collection makes a lot of stuff really convienient
2010-10-20T16:28:59  <Zannick> lavalamp_: java is pretty similar
2010-10-20T16:29:13  <jmcarthur> garbage collection can actually have less overhead than manual allocations/frees sometimes, especially if the allocates in regions
2010-10-20T16:29:24  <Zannick> there are some good examples of terrible generics in java
2010-10-20T16:29:27  <jmcarthur> *if the gc allocates in regions
2010-10-20T16:29:28  <Zannick> in terms of how you have to specify things
2010-10-20T16:29:39  <Migi32> jmcarthur, I know, it's not about the speed. It's about predictability.
2010-10-20T16:29:48  <Frontier> Accidently copying a C++ vector is even worse considering the copy-cascade you set of for every object contained in it and every object member of these objects and so on. If the copy constructors allocate file handles or lots of memory it's becomming really creepy when you see where you end up in a debugger ^^.
2010-10-20T16:29:55  <lavalamp_> Yeah I think java didn't have generics when I learned it, or I never got to them
2010-10-20T16:29:59  <Zannick> public static <T extends E> T ...
2010-10-20T16:30:39  <jmcarthur> Migi32: explicit or inferred regions are predictable gc, but it's not really in common language runtimes
2010-10-20T16:30:46  <Zannick> jmcarthur: that's why i like to use the stack. moving the stack pointer up and down is pretty low overhead
2010-10-20T16:30:54  <jmcarthur> Migi32: it's only the mark-and-sweep style gc that's less predictable
2010-10-20T16:31:38  <Frontier> Best thing is: If you haven't defined a copy-constructor for an object containing dynamically allocated memory in a pointer you have the same pointer in two objects and when you attempt to free the pointer in both objects you get an exception for a duplicate 'delete'.
2010-10-20T16:31:46  <jmcarthur> Zannick: sharing statically allocated data is even faster :)
2010-10-20T16:31:49  <Migi32> jmcarthur, and the ways it can screw up your profiling. I was profiling something once that ended up having a garbage collection cycle right in it
2010-10-20T16:32:06  <jmcarthur> Migi32: now that depends on the language and vm
2010-10-20T16:32:11  <Migi32> true

2010-10-20T16:32:42  <lavalamp_> In go you can request the GC run, if you want it to be more predictable
2010-10-20T16:32:49  <Zannick> oooh, statically allocated :)
2010-10-20T16:32:50  <jmcarthur> yeah most gc languages allow that
2010-10-20T16:32:55  <Zannick> well, that's never gc'ed, so
2010-10-20T16:32:57  <Zannick> :P
2010-10-20T16:33:01  <lavalamp_> ok that makes sense
2010-10-20T16:33:05  <Migi32> but yes. Stack > gc and manually managed memory. If only we had infinite stack space
2010-10-20T16:33:34  <jmcarthur> Zannick: okay then, heap allocated at init time. you can still continue to share that and beat the stack for speed overall
2010-10-20T16:33:41  <jmcarthur> Zannick: for certain kinds of programming, of course
2010-10-20T16:33:52  <Zannick> well, with no gc'ing the memory, certainly
2010-10-20T16:34:12  <jmcarthur> GC is poorly defined in this conversation
2010-10-20T16:34:15  <Migi32> the cool thing about C++ is you can actually override "new" and write any memory management scheme you want
2010-10-20T16:34:17  <Zannick> the only caveat with using the stack is the shoot-yourself-in-the-foot logic i mentioned earlier
2010-10-20T16:34:21  <jmcarthur> GC doesn't mean that the memory has to be scanned all the time
2010-10-20T16:34:40  <Zannick> i mean it won't be deleted or removed until the program ends
2010-10-20T16:34:50  <Frontier> Migi32: Have you done that?
2010-10-20T16:35:17  <lavalamp_> I have done that (custom memory management)
2010-10-20T16:35:23  <lavalamp_> it's almost always been a terrible idea
2010-10-20T16:35:24  <jmcarthur> Migi32: you can do it in haskell too :P
2010-10-20T16:35:41  <Zannick> one of my systems projects from college was an implementation of malloc
2010-10-20T16:35:42  <jmcarthur> at least if you use the FFI like C
2010-10-20T16:35:44  <Migi32> Frontier, umm no I am not 1337 enough :P
2010-10-20T16:36:57  <jmcarthur> Migi32: of course in haskell "new" isn't really a first class thing, so i kinda cheated
2010-10-20T16:37:01  <jmcarthur> err
2010-10-20T16:37:06  <jmcarthur> it's not language defined, that is
2010-10-20T16:37:13  <jmcarthur> it's actually more first class then in C++ in that sense
2010-10-20T16:37:25  <Migi32> jmcarthur, do you even have variables to allocate in haskell? I thought it was a functional language
2010-10-20T16:37:25  <jmcarthur> *than
2010-10-20T16:37:26  <Frontier> btw... can I have RTTI in C++ for some objects? I'd like to scan objects and classes for their members and do some magic with the information.
2010-10-20T16:37:48  <jmcarthur> Migi32: you can basically write C in haskell. it's usually used for binding to C libraries, but it can also be used to write general low level code
2010-10-20T16:38:01  <lavalamp_> Frontier: you mean as opposed to all objects?
2010-10-20T16:38:09  <lavalamp_> I don't think so
2010-10-20T16:38:30  <Frontier> lavalamp_: yeah, I don't want to bloat the code for just one class of ...er .. classes
2010-10-20T16:38:35  <jmcarthur> Migi32: your "C" code in haskell will still have a bit more overhead than raw C would though, of course
2010-10-20T16:38:55  <lavalamp_> I think it's on or off, and who knows how their server is set up
2010-10-20T16:40:04  <Frontier> lavalamp_: It is set up to compile with -O3 and -funroll-loops and links to the math library
2010-10-20T16:40:29  <jmcarthur> Migi32: but for example, i've used the haskell FFI to manage resources on the GPU in a very low level way and then expose purely functional objects for the rest of the library that have impure implementations
2010-10-20T16:40:31  <lavalamp_> Frontier: good luck then
2010-10-20T16:40:56  <lavalamp_> At least in MSVC, you have to turn on RTTI, it's not on by default
2010-10-20T16:41:35  <Frontier> Same goes for gcc.
2010-10-20T16:41:41  <lavalamp_> thought so
2010-10-20T16:41:52  <lavalamp_> Don't recommend depending on it, then :)

2010-10-20T16:51:51  <Migi32> this is something I've really been wondering about: we can basically execute arbitrary code on the server. Can't that be exploited?
2010-10-20T16:52:50  <lavalamp_> I thought they used a sandbox
2010-10-20T16:52:57  <Migi32> and if not why do most web servers provide only hosting of php files and no executables?
2010-10-20T16:53:22  <Zannick> supposedly they have safeguards against things
2010-10-20T16:53:38  <Zannick> most web servers don't know how to sandbox things appropriately
2010-10-20T16:54:17  <javagamer> Also, the rules show they are aware and concerned of the possibility of somebody exploiting something.
2010-10-20T16:54:26  <Migi32> but by most I meant all those that I know of. Well for the "no executables" part at least (not the "only php")
2010-10-20T16:55:22  <Zannick> anything that lets you host cgi is letting you run executables
2010-10-20T16:56:09  <Migi32> also, if my bot is allowed to read files can't it browse to other people's bots and read their code?
2010-10-20T16:56:32  <lavalamp_> what good will that do it?
2010-10-20T16:56:34  <Zannick> only if you could find it
2010-10-20T16:57:46  <Migi32> I wouldn't mind seeing dmj's code :P
2010-10-20T16:58:02  <Migi32> oh wait it can't send me that code after it read it

2010-10-20T16:58:50  <Frontier> Migi32: on the cloud servers, UDP 'connections' are not sandboxed
2010-10-20T16:59:12  <Frontier> so just read every file you find and send it to your pc
2010-10-20T16:59:29  <Migi32> exactly
2010-10-20T17:00:53  <lavalamp_> from the rules: Any attempt to disrupt the normal operation of the contest software or the contest servers will result in the immediate involvement of law enforcement officials. Our policy is to always prosecute.
2010-10-20T17:01:06  <lavalamp_> I wouldn't risk it ^^
2010-10-20T17:01:53  <Frontier> It wouldn't disrupt the server, but it was a bad idea to ... wake sleeping dogs
2010-10-20T17:02:35  <Migi32> Frontier, like any script kiddie will read this long boring conversation ^^
2010-10-20T17:02:54  <Migi32> at least, I'm assuming the guys who do these kind of evil things are script kiddies
2010-10-20T17:03:05  <Migi32> otherwise they'd be smart enough to write their own bot, wouldn't they :P
2010-10-20T17:03:55  <JamesMG> I'd be interested in seeing a diff of each bot with every other bot on final submission day
2010-10-20T17:04:01  <JamesMG> just for statistic purposes
2010-10-20T17:05:13  <Frontier> Well when I was on a vocational school they had some guys write a soccer wm web-app. And a cracker in my class found out it wasn't safe against SQL injections. When I heard that I asked him what that is and the day after I wrote an app that reconstructs the database structure and content from the generated error messages by the web server.
2010-10-20T17:05:56  <Frontier> The next day I used the unused account of a secretary and changed my bets after the matches had been played.
2010-10-20T17:07:00  <Migi32> Frontier, you didn't dare ;)
2010-10-20T17:07:04  <Frontier> MySQL allowed for multiple INSERTS in a row, but I needed one dummy insert first so I used the unused account for that.

2010-10-20T17:09:19  <Migi32> my high school had a web server and I ran a Nessus scan against it. Turned out they had a "test" MySQL database with account-name "test" and password ""

2010-10-20T17:13:44  <Migi32> lavalamp_, use python and write "import go"
2010-10-20T17:13:46  <Migi32> :P
2010-10-20T17:14:05  <Frontier> lavalamp_: Hey! You can install it into the sandbox environment and go from there. your c++ bot would act as a starter. but wait... downloading and installing takes longer than a sec right?
2010-10-20T17:14:23  <Frontier> python >= go?
2010-10-20T17:14:27  <lavalamp_> I'd have to have a bot good enough to last long enough to accomplish all this
2010-10-20T17:14:39  <JamesMG> just let it try until it plays ragebot
2010-10-20T17:14:40  <lavalamp_> Yeah, I'm not sure how that would work
2010-10-20T17:14:40  <JamesMG> then sit
2010-10-20T17:14:53  <lavalamp_> (importing go from python)
2010-10-20T17:15:31  <Migi32> Frontier, no I was refering xkcd comics like this: http://xkcd.com/353/
2010-10-20T17:15:36  <Frontier> Or... write a C++ bot that CONTAINS go as a data section, like a self-extracting zip file.
2010-10-20T17:15:36  <JamesMG> write a c++ UDP server that connects to your local machine and executes your go bot when it's run...
2010-10-20T17:15:54  <Frontier> JamesMG: best idea ever!
2010-10-20T17:16:25  <lavalamp_> Awesome!
2010-10-20T17:17:12  <JamesMG> The amount of "What...?" if you open sourced that after the comp would be hilarious
2010-10-20T17:18:16  <lavalamp_> maybe I could disassemble a compiled version of my bot and include that as inline assembly in a c bot
2010-10-20T17:19:02  <Migi32> lavalamp_, or you could just compile your bot and execute it from inside C
2010-10-20T17:19:10  <Migi32> I think that's allowed actually
2010-10-20T17:19:36  <lavalamp_> Migi32: thanks, maybe I will do that if they never get go running
2010-10-20T17:19:57  <Migi32> !seen j3camero
2010-10-20T17:19:57  <contestbot> Migi32: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 2 weeks, 1 day, 19 hours, and 11 seconds ago: <j3camero> amstan: yes, but no names, haha.
2010-10-20T17:20:02  <lavalamp_> hell, I will do that when I get home and see how my last bot does
2010-10-20T17:20:14  <davidd> lavalamp_ google for "obfuscation"
2010-10-20T17:20:18  <Migi32> lavalamp_, that's rather likely actually
2010-10-20T17:20:20  <amstan> yay! space pirate ship: http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-parties-plan-to-shoot-torrent-site-into-orbit-101020/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Torrentfreak+(Torrentfreak)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher
2010-10-20T17:20:48  <davidd> there is lots of code that can make your program non understandable
2010-10-20T17:20:52  <lavalamp_> Migi32: la la la I'm not listening
2010-10-20T17:20:55  <Migi32> amstan, lol that is awesome
2010-10-20T17:21:33  <Migi32> :P
2010-10-20T17:21:50  <lavalamp_> amstan, is that allowed, if I write a c++ "bot" that just executes my precompiled go bot?
2010-10-20T17:22:03  <amstan> lavalamp_: idk if you can
2010-10-20T17:22:16  <amstan> you might be blocked by the sandbox
2010-10-20T17:22:18  <JamesMG> can you unban him if he gets banned for trying?  :)
2010-10-20T17:22:24  <Migi32> I'm wondering if they'd actually shoot that ship out of space :P
2010-10-20T17:22:41  <davidd> Migi32, on what grounds?
2010-10-20T17:22:42  <amstan> it's probably allowed, especially since you're just trying it as a workaround for nonexistant go support
2010-10-20T17:22:50  <Zannick> the rules say reading from files you supply is okay, but not writing
2010-10-20T17:22:55  <davidd> shooting a spacecraft equals war
2010-10-20T17:23:00  <Migi32> davidd, copyright infringement
2010-10-20T17:23:10  <amstan> there's no rules that i'm aware of that prevent you from doing this
2010-10-20T17:23:23  <amstan> but i'm wondering if the sandbox allows you to execute other processes like that
2010-10-20T17:23:24  <lavalamp_> I'd include go source, too
2010-10-20T17:23:26  <JamesMG> if it works I may do it to sidestep the C# compiler issue actually
2010-10-20T17:23:27  <davidd> copyright infringment isnt a crime, its civil disobedience

2010-10-20T17:24:40  <amstan> a lot of the syscalls are not allowed
2010-10-20T17:24:54  <lavalamp_> hmm
2010-10-20T17:25:03  <Zannick> i'm not sure how that's prevented
2010-10-20T17:25:05  <amstan> lavalamp_: look up the sandbox stuff
2010-10-20T17:25:12  <amstan> lavalamp_: you might not be able to
2010-10-20T17:25:22  <lavalamp_> Where is the sandbox stuff?
2010-10-20T17:25:28  <amstan> @where repo
2010-10-20T17:25:28  <contestbot> amstan: repo = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/
2010-10-20T17:25:34  <amstan> in there somewhere
2010-10-20T17:25:35  <lavalamp_> thx
2010-10-20T17:25:36  <amstan> lol
2010-10-20T17:25:42  <Zannick> i would think exec would work/be allowable
2010-10-20T17:25:48  <Zannick> since it replaces the running process
2010-10-20T17:26:00  <Zannick> but then you have be careful about exploits
2010-10-20T17:26:50  <Migi32> if all fails you can read the file to memory then in assembly write "call (address of main function inside that memory block"
2010-10-20T17:27:06  <Zannick> hahaha ew
2010-10-20T17:27:09  <Zannick> but yeah
2010-10-20T17:27:20  <amstan> good luck
2010-10-20T17:27:25  <lavalamp_> I might need it
2010-10-20T17:27:30  <amstan> i'
2010-10-20T17:27:31  <Migi32> really not that hard I think

2010-10-20T17:27:35  <davidd> link not correct
2010-10-20T17:27:39  <lavalamp_> it would be so much easier for you guys to just install go >.<

2010-10-20T17:27:58  <lavalamp_> ok I appreciate it :)

2010-10-20T17:28:21  <Zannick> i blame jeff for starting the contest and not sticking with it

2010-10-20T17:28:56  <Zannick> even jeff should know about N+2
2010-10-20T17:29:15  <Migi32> actually it's the only way I can think of that would make this work, because calling the compiled program as a process can be considered a "thread"
2010-10-20T17:30:18  <Migi32> davidd, obfuscating is old-fashioned, you should write underhanded code
2010-10-20T17:31:18  <JamesMG> underhanded code?  Gonna need a sample :)
2010-10-20T17:31:31  <Zannick> ah, no, the fcntl stuff is just file descriptors
2010-10-20T17:32:23  <a1k0n> haha so far my 1.5 months of development have yielded 6 elo points
2010-10-20T17:32:52  <a1k0n> beats teh -120 elo points i had previously anyway

2010-10-20T17:33:06  <JamesMG> don't feel too bad, the last week has yielded -100 for me
2010-10-20T17:33:26  <Zannick> i'm not on the charts yet :)
2010-10-20T17:33:36  <a1k0n> i feel pretty good about the idea though.  there's a lot of room for improvement here
2010-10-20T17:33:39  <jmcarthur> the absolute elo score doesn't matter anyway
2010-10-20T17:33:54  <jmcarthur> i really wish they were normalized against ragebot rather than just adding 2000 to them
2010-10-20T17:33:58  <a1k0n> yeah but i'm talking relative elo points here
2010-10-20T17:34:06  <jmcarthur> relative to what?
2010-10-20T17:34:30  <a1k0n> to... everybody.  elo1-elo0 = 6
2010-10-20T17:34:47  <Migi32> JamesMG, the contest: http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 the winners: http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=12
2010-10-20T17:34:51  <a1k0n> relative to my old version, but like, if you just directly compare the two it beats the old version 99% of the time
2010-10-20T17:34:59  <jmcarthur> "everybody" has a single elo score you're comparing to?
2010-10-20T17:35:08  <jmcarthur> oh okay
2010-10-20T17:35:28  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.18.205> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-10-20T17:35:40  <a1k0n> so it makes sense to say "i gained 6 elo points relative to everybody"
2010-10-20T17:35:41  <jmcarthur> although that may not be the best measure since it doesn't factor "everybody" into the equation
2010-10-20T17:35:44  <a1k0n> as long as you have a baseline
2010-10-20T17:35:47  <jmcarthur> overfitting is a possibility
2010-10-20T17:36:01  <a1k0n> very much so but it's a lot less overfit than just comparing two bots to one another.
2010-10-20T17:36:34  <jmcarthur> oh i thought that's what you were implying that you did
2010-10-20T17:36:45  <a1k0n> no i'm still running all my bots on tcp server
2010-10-20T17:36:49  <jmcarthur> oh!

I just have a slightly modified starter package bot atm... just tried http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=599960 , and it appears that the game crashed aswell?
2010-10-20T21:39:11  <rommel> Note that my bot seems fine AFAIK?

2010-10-20T22:21:03  <Zannick> that's a feature, not a bug
2010-10-20T22:22:11  <davidjliu> ah... I guess it's just a little messed up right now with the 5 games per minute
2010-10-20T22:22:22  <davidjliu> I assume that feature will be changed for the final contest? heh, hopefully, at least
2010-10-20T22:23:33  <Zannick> the final contest is a month away

2010-10-20T23:12:13  <antimatroid> look at the number of losses they have
2010-10-20T23:12:16  <amstan_> i agree
2010-10-20T23:12:18  <amstan_> wtf?
2010-10-20T23:12:29  <qacek> if it only uses scores from the past 3 days there probably aren't many games to use
2010-10-20T23:12:41  <antimatroid> it shouldn't just be using scores from the last 3 days surely
2010-10-20T23:12:56  <qacek> that's what davidjliu said earlier
2010-10-20T23:13:09  <amstan_> he won against second though..
2010-10-20T23:13:21  <antimatroid> shouldn't put you into first
2010-10-20T23:13:30  <amstan_> also won against chotting

2010-10-20T23:13:41  <amstan_> against ebraun too
2010-10-20T23:14:06  <qacek> well smatcher has won every game the past 3 days so it makes sense he would be in first place
2010-10-20T23:14:23  <amstan_> maybe he looses against noobs, but wins against good bots
2010-10-20T23:14:27  <amstan_> like.. elo will do this
2010-10-20T23:15:05  <Zannick> yeah, elo is not very good for rps
2010-10-20T23:15:13  <qacek> rps?
2010-10-20T23:15:25  <Zannick> rock paper scissors
2010-10-20T23:15:38  <amstan_> not to be confused with rps matches, which would work
2010-10-20T23:16:40  <antimatroid> i don't think this is rock paper scissors
2010-10-20T23:17:00  <antimatroid> people keep throwing that around a lot
2010-10-20T23:17:52  <Zannick> my point is actually that elo won't work well for a nontransitive graph
2010-10-20T23:18:05  <Zannick> who is the better player, when a > b > c > a?
2010-10-20T23:19:45  <qacek> i don't know how elo works but it seems to be used to rank plenty of other nontransitive graphs
2010-10-20T23:23:18  <amstan_> well
2010-10-20T23:23:22  <amstan_> sent an email rant
2010-10-20T23:23:31  <amstan_> hopefully jeff will notice
