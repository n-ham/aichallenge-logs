2012-09-19T03:53:36  <mcstar> well, the new students are lured to the top of the building 'to go and see the pool on the roof' of the school
2012-09-19T03:53:44  <mcstar> and the door opens from the inside
2012-09-19T03:53:47  <mcstar> but not from the outside
2012-09-19T03:54:14  <pairofdice> Ah right, I remember that
2012-09-19T03:54:18  <mcstar> and when Johnny walks through the door, he finds a lot of frustrated guys on the roof already
2012-09-19T03:54:37  <mcstar> as a revenge, he turns on the automatic fire extinguisher

2012-09-19T03:57:18  <mcstar> this game is a great example of random /= unpredictable

2012-09-19T04:06:42  <mcstar> what for?
2012-09-19T04:07:28  <antimatroidl> because it's huge
2012-09-19T04:11:54  <mcstar> it is easiest to forget about it

2012-09-19T05:00:49  <antimatroidl> i can't open a new text document up into this space cause there's already one open in another space
2012-09-19T05:01:15  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-19T05:01:19  <mcstar> loser
2012-09-19T05:01:28  <mcstar> use a proper editor
2012-09-19T05:01:30  <mcstar> like emacs
2012-09-19T05:01:32  <antimatroidl> but seriously, who comes up with this bullshit?
2012-09-19T05:01:37  <mcstar> aquamacs
2012-09-19T05:01:42  <antimatroidl> why would you have the os semantics like that?
2012-09-19T05:01:44  <antimatroidl> it's awful
2012-09-19T05:02:16  <pairofdice> Haha, that's stupid
2012-09-19T05:03:11  <mcstar> the problem is that he doesnt use a proper editor
2012-09-19T05:03:27  <mcstar> who the fuck cares about osx's text editor?
2012-09-19T05:03:27  <antimatroidl> to top it off i can't alt tab to text editor
2012-09-19T05:03:28  <antimatroidl> wtf
2012-09-19T05:03:39  <antimatroidl> mcstar: it would be the same for another text editor
2012-09-19T05:03:45  <mcstar> no
2012-09-19T05:03:48  <mcstar> ofc not
2012-09-19T05:03:54  <antimatroidl> i don't use terminal editors
2012-09-19T05:03:54  <mcstar> lol
2012-09-19T05:03:56  <antimatroidl> you know this
2012-09-19T05:04:03  <mcstar> it is not a temrinal editor
2012-09-19T05:04:05  <mcstar> lol
2012-09-19T05:04:11  <antimatroidl> then how would it be different?
2012-09-19T05:04:21  <antimatroidl> if i clicked on emacs it would take me to the open window on the other space
2012-09-19T05:04:27  <antimatroidl> it's fucking up because of osx, not text editor
2012-09-19T05:04:33  <mcstar> lol
2012-09-19T05:04:36  <mcstar> i see
2012-09-19T05:04:38  <mcstar> thats a different issue
2012-09-19T05:04:44  <mcstar> ofc it takes you there
2012-09-19T05:05:00  <antimatroidl> why of course?
2012-09-19T05:05:06  <antimatroidl> i want a new text editor window
2012-09-19T05:05:06  <mcstar> because it makes sense
2012-09-19T05:05:18  <mcstar> thats the onnly not stupid way to do it
2012-09-19T05:05:40  <mcstar> those icons represent applications
2012-09-19T05:05:57  <mcstar> if an application is running, it will take you there, where you can see it
2012-09-19T05:06:13  <mcstar> now, either then ask for a new document
2012-09-19T05:06:21  <mcstar> with command-n (guess)
2012-09-19T05:06:28  <antimatroidl> but if i ask for a new document it's in that other space
2012-09-19T05:06:35  <antimatroidl> and it's not easy to move active windows between spaces on osx
2012-09-19T05:06:38  <antimatroidl> because osx licks ball
2012-09-19T05:06:39  <antimatroidl> s
2012-09-19T05:06:52  <mcstar> or when you are at another workspace, right click on the icon, and see if theres an option of opening a new documemnt
2012-09-19T05:07:02  <antimatroidl> there isn't, already tried
2012-09-19T05:07:06  <antimatroidl> that may be text editors fault
2012-09-19T05:07:10  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-19T05:07:12  <antimatroidl> still apple software isn't it?
2012-09-19T05:07:19  <mcstar> idk what editor are you using
2012-09-19T05:07:25  <antimatroidl> i'm all about hating apple for their shit software
2012-09-19T05:07:30  <antimatroidl> textedit
2012-09-19T05:07:52  <mcstar> id just use quicksilve in any case
2012-09-19T05:07:57  <mcstar> that way better than clicking around
2012-09-19T05:08:16  <mcstar> i was sold on launchers even when i was on windows
2012-09-19T05:08:27  <antimatroidl> i would prefer clicking the application opened a new version of the application
2012-09-19T05:08:29  <mcstar> i used a quicksilver clone, Launchy
2012-09-19T05:08:31  <antimatroidl> i can already alt tab between spaces
2012-09-19T05:08:40  <antimatroidl> annoyingly
2012-09-19T05:08:49  <mcstar> antimatroidl: that would be quite unnatural
2012-09-19T05:09:00  <antimatroidl> alt tab should be between open windows of the active space
2012-09-19T05:09:00  <mcstar> you click on it, and it opens a new doucment?
2012-09-19T05:09:06  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-19T05:09:09  <antimatroidl> that would be sweet
2012-09-19T05:09:10  <mcstar> so what happens, when that icon is not a 'document editor'
2012-09-19T05:09:18  <antimatroidl> new window
2012-09-19T05:09:20  <antimatroidl> new terminal window
2012-09-19T05:09:21  <mcstar> always opens a new instance of an app?
2012-09-19T05:09:24  <antimatroidl> new browser window
2012-09-19T05:09:28  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-19T05:09:41  <mcstar> im sorry, but that is silly
2012-09-19T05:09:46  <antimatroidl> right click (or equivalent) to get a list of open windows
2012-09-19T05:09:59  <antimatroidl> or at least have the os put a new window by default option
2012-09-19T05:10:09  <mcstar> i middle-click on the icon to start a new something of it
2012-09-19T05:10:22  <mcstar> hover, gets the list of windows
2012-09-19T05:10:35  <mcstar> click, 'presents' them with that tiling effect
2012-09-19T05:10:47  <antimatroidl> i hate effects
