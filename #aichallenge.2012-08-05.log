2012-08-05T08:41:25  <antimatroid> mcstar: I don't like cloud storage and server based apps etc. i've decided
2012-08-05T08:41:39  <mcstar> o.O
2012-08-05T08:41:52  <mcstar> a little context?
2012-08-05T08:42:00  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/YM7Hq.png
2012-08-05T08:42:04  <antimatroid> fuck that
2012-08-05T08:42:44  <antimatroid> it's essentially then a rental service, you aren't purchasing the software, you're renting the right to use it
2012-08-05T08:43:18  <mcstar> so?
2012-08-05T08:43:33  <antimatroid> so, if i buy something i would like to be able to use it indefinitely
2012-08-05T08:43:40  <mcstar> asinine idea, i wouldnt play with steam
2012-08-05T08:43:52  <delt0r> antimatroid: its a trade off... I don't mind steam so much since I would be getting $10 games mostly
2012-08-05T08:44:11  * antimatroid has never used steam anyway
2012-08-05T08:44:13  <mcstar> i only need my hl, hl2 anyway, those are offline games
2012-08-05T08:44:17  <antimatroid> i don't like the concept though
2012-08-05T08:44:17  <delt0r> in which case i don't mind the implied "rent till can't be bothered"
2012-08-05T08:44:43  <antimatroid> if i buy a game, i want to be able to play it when i want to in the future
2012-08-05T08:44:50  <delt0r> as long as people are not tricked into it... ie it is clear at the start... i don't mind
2012-08-05T08:44:54  <mcstar> but you didnt buy the game!~
2012-08-05T08:45:01  <mcstar> you bought the right to play it
2012-08-05T08:45:08  <antimatroid> delt0r: but then all services become like that and nobody is left with a real choice
2012-08-05T08:45:21  <delt0r> antimatroid: try playing something for the amaiga 500 today...!
2012-08-05T08:45:25  <mcstar> you have a choice: leave that alone
2012-08-05T08:45:28  <antimatroid> mcstar: yeah, and I don't like that way of doing things, that's what i'm saying
2012-08-05T08:45:38  <antimatroid> mcstar: i wont have a choice when all services are like that
2012-08-05T08:45:43  <delt0r> antimatroid: dont' pay... don't play.. you always have a chioce..and its only games...
2012-08-05T08:45:55  <delt0r> I don't play anymore because that mean booting to windows
2012-08-05T08:46:07  <delt0r> so rather than do that --i hardly play anymore
2012-08-05T08:46:10  <antimatroid> it might not always be only games
2012-08-05T08:46:14  <delt0r> steam on linux may change that
2012-08-05T08:46:16  <mcstar> lol there are much more serious bullshit going on in finance and law
2012-08-05T08:46:26  <mcstar> who cares for some games
2012-08-05T08:46:31  <delt0r> mcstar speaks the truth
2012-08-05T08:46:42  <antimatroid> lol that's like saying all problems but starvation in third world are irrelevant
2012-08-05T08:46:49  <delt0r> antimatroid: free as in beer and GPL whatever is not going away
2012-08-05T08:47:06  <antimatroid> yeah and i'll continue to only use open source where possible
2012-08-05T08:47:18  <antimatroid> but i don't like the idea of in the future not being able to actually purchase stuff
2012-08-05T08:47:26  <delt0r> that means at the very least there is always an alternative.
2012-08-05T08:47:36  <antimatroid> if everything moves to cloud storage and server based it'll all work like that
2012-08-05T08:49:00  * mcstar visions that some day in the near future google will retain rights to everyone's deleted email
2012-08-05T08:49:19  <mcstar> i wonder if they have a plan with their great idea of 'dont delete emails'
2012-08-05T08:49:35  <mcstar> maybe they use them as an iformation source for their machine learning stuff

2012-08-05T15:00:39  <mleise> where is scope ? well it is usefull when you need to free resources for example and you'd have to do it in a try catch
2012-08-05T15:00:52  <mleise> where allocation and freeing will be miles apart in code
2012-08-05T15:01:18  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-05T15:01:20  <mleise> so you just write scope(exit/failure) res.free; right after the resource allocation
2012-08-05T15:01:43  <mleise> it's a really neat feature compared to java and the like
2012-08-05T15:01:45  <mcstar> is it possible, that the resource is freed when it goes out of scope?
2012-08-05T15:02:14  <mleise> that too, but imagine you just used malloc()
2012-08-05T15:02:45  <mcstar> this is a bit weird/cloudy for me
2012-08-05T15:02:50  <mcstar> there are pointers in D
2012-08-05T15:03:10  <mleise> these girls and that song you posted ... oh my
2012-08-05T15:03:18  <mcstar> so, how can an object be garbage collected if i can have a pointer point ot it?
2012-08-05T15:03:27  <mcstar> mleise: i didnt watch it
2012-08-05T15:03:35  <mcstar> it was a random response video for pairofdice
2012-08-05T15:03:50  <pairofdice> :p
2012-08-05T15:04:18  <mleise> I dodn't want to watch it, but when I started the video, you asked me what scope is, so I had them saying "lol, omg, i knew it" all the time :p
2012-08-05T15:04:55  <mleise> best comment was "I buy your web cam for 350$ if you don't replace it, ok?"
2012-08-05T15:05:06  <pairofdice> :D
2012-08-05T15:05:22  <mcstar> what does that mean? the girls sucked?
2012-08-05T15:06:04  <mleise> uh why do i think the wrong thing now? well, yes that video was weird.
2012-08-05T15:06:12  <mleise> pointers
2012-08-05T15:06:31  <mleise> well, the GC works with pointers
2012-08-05T15:06:44  <mcstar> really?
2012-08-05T15:06:47  <mleise> it knows which memory blocks it allocated (easy)
2012-08-05T15:06:51  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-05T15:07:05  <mcstar> but if i can take the address of something?
2012-08-05T15:07:08  <mleise> and then it traverses all known pointers and checks if anything still points into GC memory
2012-08-05T15:07:17  <mcstar> are there references?
2012-08-05T15:07:24  <mcstar> if its a reference, i can understand
2012-08-05T15:07:26  <mleise> these blocks that are references somewhere aren't freed
2012-08-05T15:07:28  <mcstar> but nit with pointers
2012-08-05T15:07:38  <mcstar> not*
2012-08-05T15:07:39  <mleise> references ~= pointers
2012-08-05T15:07:46  <mcstar> no
2012-08-05T15:08:12  <mcstar> at least, wrt c++, you have to initialize a reference
2012-08-05T15:08:17  <mcstar> and you can do it only once
2012-08-05T15:08:29  <mcstar> this makes sense, and i can see how a GC can handle that
2012-08-05T15:08:36  <mcstar> but a pointer is too arbitrary
2012-08-05T15:08:46  <mleise> yes, so is the garbage collection
2012-08-05T15:08:55  <mleise> it just checks every pointer it finds
2012-08-05T15:09:19  <mleise> it looks at the stack and at so called 'roots'
2012-08-05T15:09:24  *** kilae <kilae!~chatzilla@catv-161-018.tbwil.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2012-08-05T15:09:40  <mleise> those are the entry points, like global variables that are statically known
2012-08-05T15:10:28  <mcstar> what if a pointer points to a part of a resource?
2012-08-05T15:10:33  <mleise> if a root is a binary tree node, for example, the GC knows from the type info that it contains 2 pointers and will check them as well
2012-08-05T15:10:39  <mcstar> like, a member in an class
2012-08-05T15:10:41  <mcstar> or similar
2012-08-05T15:10:42  <mleise> what is a resource?
2012-08-05T15:10:45  <mcstar> or an element of an array
2012-08-05T15:10:48  <mleise> memory?
2012-08-05T15:10:52  <mcstar> yes
2012-08-05T15:11:20  <mleise> well, then it knows that the pointer points inside of a memory block that is annotated 'instance of class X'
2012-08-05T15:11:27  <mleise> and it will keep the object alive
2012-08-05T15:11:30  <mcstar> but how can it know that?
2012-08-05T15:11:50  <mleise> when you allocate an object the GC tags that memory block used for it
2012-08-05T15:12:07  <mleise> there is always a type info associated with each memory block
2012-08-05T15:12:32  <mleise> at least that's my understanding
2012-08-05T15:12:47  <mcstar> it doesnt click for me
2012-08-05T15:12:52  <mleise> no?
2012-08-05T15:12:55  <mcstar> no
2012-08-05T15:13:15  <mleise> reminds me of myself, when i tried to understand your haskell code
2012-08-05T15:13:23  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-05T15:13:59  <mcstar> let me write down a contrived example
2012-08-05T15:14:00  <mleise> you write "new Object", and the GC will allocate a block large enough for that object + some meta info
2012-08-05T15:14:19  <mleise> the meta info can be as simple as the type id
2012-08-05T15:14:31  <mcstar> lets say, you have an object, thats basically an array of something, lets say ints
2012-08-05T15:14:36  <mleise> so class Object may be id #1
2012-08-05T15:14:47  <mleise> waaaiiiiit

2012-08-05T15:15:00  <mleise> the object has a field like int[1234] ?
2012-08-05T15:15:15  <mleise> or is it a dynamic array of int[]
2012-08-05T15:15:17  <mcstar> not necessarily
2012-08-05T15:15:22  <mcstar> it can have anything
2012-08-05T15:15:27  *** kilae <kilae!~chatzilla@catv-161-018.tbwil.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2012-08-05T15:15:27  <mcstar> let me write this down
2012-08-05T15:15:32  <mleise> you confuse me
2012-08-05T15:15:40  <mcstar> cont'd
2012-08-05T15:15:40  <mleise> but don't break the type system ok?
2012-08-05T15:16:37  <mcstar> so, if i take the address of that object, and assign it to a pointer, when the gc checks the poiters, it can compare the value of the pointer to the starting address of allocated obejcts
2012-08-05T15:17:05  <mcstar> so it can see, whether the pointer points to something meaningful, and wont free the resource
2012-08-05T15:17:25  <mcstar> but what does it do when i took the address of a member variable of an object?
2012-08-05T15:17:39  <mcstar> since that address wont be the starting address of the allocated obejct
2012-08-05T15:18:19  <mleise> easy, the GC never ever relied on the 'start address' in the first place
2012-08-05T15:18:37  <mleise> it looks at memory ranges and is only concerned about the pointer pointing into that range
2012-08-05T15:18:46  <mcstar> aha
2012-08-05T15:19:00  <mcstar> i thought dealing with ranges wasnt too efficient
2012-08-05T15:19:13  <mcstar> so i tried to solve the problem without allocation ranges
2012-08-05T15:19:28  <mleise> well, it is a systems language. it has a hard time with garbage collection.
2012-08-05T15:20:03  <mleise> Java can implement far more effective algorithms, because of what was your concern
2012-08-05T15:20:28  <mleise> there is no pointer into some other range or good old "unions" or even void*
2012-08-05T15:26:25  <mleise> i wonder what problem you are trying to solve?

2012-08-05T16:16:47  <mcstar> what was i thinking...
2012-08-05T16:18:40  <antimatroid> lol
2012-08-05T16:18:46  <antimatroid> what were you thinking?
2012-08-05T16:19:06  <antimatroid> tmd from kazaa?
2012-08-05T16:19:30  <mcstar> idk what tmd is and never used kazaa
2012-08-05T16:19:40  <mcstar> i wanted to watch this movie
2012-08-05T16:19:42  <antimatroid> old cam release group
2012-08-05T16:19:51  <antimatroid> i used to download them from kazaa on dial up
2012-08-05T16:19:52  <mcstar> but i should have waited for a blu ray rip
