2012-05-07T10:14:46  <pairofdice> and he just does [1::2]
2012-05-07T10:15:08  <thestinger> well that's kinda pointless
2012-05-07T10:15:13  <thestinger> you can use a step in range
2012-05-07T10:15:20  <thestinger> and then reduce to a slice
2012-05-07T10:15:57  <pairofdice> yeah

2012-05-07T10:36:50  <thestinger> pairofdice: btw, how fast was your solution to the week3 crypto challenge?
2012-05-07T10:37:11  * thestinger just brute forced it and then used gmpy :P
2012-05-07T10:37:36  <thestinger> turns out python ints actually have a .bit_length() method
2012-05-07T10:37:39  <pairofdice> I was in Estonia so I only had time for the 3 others last week
2012-05-07T10:37:44  <thestinger> ah
2012-05-07T10:37:51  <thestinger> it was actually really easy
2012-05-07T10:37:54  <pairofdice> oh
2012-05-07T10:37:54  <thestinger> the video makes it sound hard
2012-05-07T10:38:01  <thestinger> but once you see the code it's easy
2012-05-07T10:38:08  <thestinger> my solution is 1 line
2012-05-07T10:38:15  *** mcstar <mcstar!~mcstar@adsl-89-134-12-173.monradsl.monornet.hu> has joined #aichallenge
2012-05-07T10:38:26  <thestinger> (a).bit_length() to count the # of bits
2012-05-07T10:38:34  <thestinger> and gmpy.popcount(a) to sum them
2012-05-07T10:38:40  <thestinger> that's just an optimization though
2012-05-07T10:38:49  <thestinger> the code they give you includes a function to do that
2012-05-07T10:39:10  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/Rafa
2012-05-07T10:44:03  <mcstar> why would you need the bits of the exponent?
2012-05-07T10:44:31  <mcstar> id just half the exponent while i can
2012-05-07T10:45:08  <thestinger> mcstar: because you need to test if count(bits) + sum(bits) is 28
2012-05-07T10:45:32  <thestinger> it's to exploit a timing attack (you know it took 26 multiplications to calculate)
2012-05-07T10:45:33  <mcstar> what is this problem?
2012-05-07T10:45:43  <thestinger> breaking diffie-hellman, sec
2012-05-07T10:45:47  <thestinger> I'll pastebin it for you
2012-05-07T10:45:57  <thestinger> it's trivial to do :P
2012-05-07T10:45:59  <mcstar> is this crypto?
2012-05-07T10:46:10  <mcstar> coursera's?
2012-05-07T10:46:14  <thestinger> no, udacity's
2012-05-07T10:46:25  <thestinger> and yes crypto
2012-05-07T10:47:16  <mcstar> i didnt realize you stayed on that one too
2012-05-07T10:48:16  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-05-07T10:48:45  <thestinger> mcstar: https://gist.github.com/653d445f79f20411b2a1 that's the problem
2012-05-07T10:49:01  <thestinger> video is just like 30 secs and not important (just tells you the same thing as the comment at the top)
2012-05-07T10:55:07  <mcstar> thestinger: so there are proper programming assignments there
2012-05-07T10:55:19  <thestinger> yes
2012-05-07T10:55:28  <thestinger> lots of the quizzes are programming assignments too
2012-05-07T10:55:51  <thestinger> they have unit tests and run your code through them to check if it's correct basically
2012-05-07T10:57:30  <mcstar> some people whined about that their answers werent accepted in ml class, cause they didnt match within numerical precision
2012-05-07T10:57:41  <thestinger> mcstar: the other homework ones from that unit were implementing rabin-miller and finding primitive roots
2012-05-07T10:57:48  <thestinger> aha that happened in cs373
2012-05-07T10:57:56  <thestinger> they used rounding though
2012-05-07T10:58:12  <thestinger> was only an issue early on
2012-05-07T10:59:03  <thestinger> mcstar: the main difference between coursera and udacity is the number of quizzes
2012-05-07T10:59:23  <thestinger> udacity has the lecture broken up into little chunks with lots of quizzes (some theory, some programming) in between
2012-05-07T10:59:41  <mcstar> ihavent done week6 yet
2012-05-07T11:00:01  <thestinger> of crypto class? I haven't either
2012-05-07T11:00:30  <mcstar> yes
2012-05-07T11:00:40  <thestinger> unit 4 of udacity's crypto class is asymmetric encryption too
2012-05-07T11:00:55  <thestinger> going to do that first since it's easier :P
2012-05-07T11:01:59  <mcstar> i get negligible speedup from running fftw on 2 threads
2012-05-07T11:02:29  <thestinger> threads suck :P
2012-05-07T11:02:46  <thestinger> SIMD > threads
2012-05-07T11:03:02  <thestinger> mcstar: and in a real application it might be slower
2012-05-07T11:03:05  <thestinger> it screws up the cache
2012-05-07T11:03:20  <mcstar> thestinger: if a C function is exposed in python, and it expects an pointer to an array, and i give it a numpy array(or one that was allocated by fftw in python), do you think its ok?
2012-05-07T11:03:45  <thestinger> using ctypes?
2012-05-07T11:03:51  <mcstar> probably
2012-05-07T11:03:56  <mcstar> it is hidden
2012-05-07T11:04:14  <mcstar> but this hangs my python
2012-05-07T11:04:42  <thestinger> just expose it with Boost.Python
2012-05-07T11:05:02  <mcstar> there already a bindig, pyfftw, im not going to make another
2012-05-07T11:07:58  <thestinger> oh
2012-05-07T11:08:04  <thestinger> are you doing it directly or through the lib?
2012-05-07T11:08:28  <mcstar> lib
2012-05-07T11:09:02  <mcstar> fftw3.lib.lib contain all the fftw functions
2012-05-07T11:09:09  <mcstar> s
2012-05-07T11:09:32  <mcstar> but it is automatically generated, cause they arent in the sources
2012-05-07T11:13:22  <mcstar> fuck me
2012-05-07T11:13:26  <mcstar> it is nice though
2012-05-07T11:13:33  <mcstar> solveing my precious PFC equations
2012-05-07T11:13:36  <mcstar> -e
2012-05-07T11:14:10  <mcstar> i should have done this earlier, but we usually do it on clusters or gpu's
2012-05-07T11:14:19  <mcstar> so i was worried about speed
2012-05-07T11:14:31  <mcstar> but i can manage 2d problems on this little desktop
