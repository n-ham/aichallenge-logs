2011-04-29T00:25:46  <jaycobcoleman> Is number of entries limited for each person?
2011-04-29T00:28:04  <antimatroid> you can have only one entry
2011-04-29T00:28:14  <antimatroid> if you are caught with more than one active entry all will be disqualified
2011-04-29T00:28:32  <antimatroid> unless it was obviously truly an accident
2011-04-29T00:28:49  <jaycobcoleman> alright, that's what I thought.
2011-04-29T00:29:18  <jaycobcoleman> when you make changes though is the system going to recognize it as the same bot?
2011-04-29T00:31:37  <antimatroid> you are logged in when you upload your bot
2011-04-29T00:31:47  <antimatroid> it knows who you are
2011-04-29T00:32:11  <antimatroid> you zip the folder containing your bot and upload that to submit it
2011-04-29T00:32:36  <antimatroid> containing the source files* for your bot
2011-04-29T00:32:54  <jaycobcoleman> okay, then will any new submissions uploaded overwrite your old one?
2011-04-29T00:33:13  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-29T00:33:22  <antimatroid> and your score will be reset
2011-04-29T00:33:27  <antimatroid> score/rank
2011-04-29T00:33:43  <antimatroid> it wasn't reset last time and i think it was bad
2011-04-29T00:33:49  <antimatroid> i'm very much in favour of resetting the scores
2011-04-29T00:33:59  <jaycobcoleman> perhaps we should give people the option of keeping their rank?
2011-04-29T00:34:03  <antimatroid> no
2011-04-29T00:34:09  <jaycobcoleman> why?
2011-04-29T00:34:12  <antimatroid> people resubmit a lot to keep their rank up
2011-04-29T00:34:16  <antimatroid> which is also a drain on the servers
2011-04-29T00:34:25  <antimatroid> and people don't play anyone outside their rank region
2011-04-29T00:34:27  <antimatroid> well, hardly
2011-04-29T00:34:38  <jaycobcoleman> alright :P
2011-04-29T00:34:50  <antimatroid> it doesn't take that long for your bot to get to where it's meant to
2011-04-29T00:34:58  <jaycobcoleman> always resetting is definitely better than never resetting
2011-04-29T00:35:07  <jaycobcoleman> and yes the ranking system is very intuituve
2011-04-29T00:35:11  <jaycobcoleman> *intuitive

2011-04-29T01:46:42  <jaycobcoleman> if we ever intend to use get_map_output for showing map output from the perspective of a specific player then it'll have to be adapted to include UNSEEN_FOOD

2011-04-29T05:35:02  <stocha> bhasker: weird. Some people have used the bot with success. Maybe you had it timeout. Antimatroid said it was timeouting on his system. (although it only takes 20ms on mine)
2011-04-29T05:35:30  <stocha> Another hypothesis is that the new game engine is not compatible with old bots.

2011-04-29T05:38:09  <stocha> i don't know. Bhasker says it doesn't move. Most probably it timedout.
2011-04-29T05:38:46  <stocha> Anyway. You can't speak of "accurate" ranking unless each bot plays at least 1000 games.
2011-04-29T05:39:53  <jaycobcoleman> stocha: what issue are you talking about?

2011-04-29T05:45:22  <stocha> i don't want to try to dig into that, as i have very few time at the moment.
2011-04-29T05:45:34  <jaycobcoleman> hmm :/ kay
2011-04-29T05:45:46  <Frontier> you can set the timeout to a larger value and test again
2011-04-29T05:46:02  <stocha> i wasn't the one doing the testing.
2011-04-29T05:46:06  <antimatroid> nah that was my issue
2011-04-29T05:46:13  <antimatroid> but it wasn't working properly for some reason

2011-04-29T05:58:28  <antimatroid> i wont do well
2011-04-29T05:58:30  <antimatroid> something to do though
2011-04-29T05:58:54  <antimatroid> the qualification round is usually trivial
2011-04-29T05:59:22  <jaycobcoleman> ...how trivial?
2011-04-29T06:01:13  <antimatroid> you should be able to get through qualifying
2011-04-29T06:01:25  <antimatroid> there are past problems up that you can practice with

2011-04-29T06:43:06  <mcstar> can i have some cpp clarification?
2011-04-29T06:43:28  <antimatroid> possibly
2011-04-29T06:43:38  <antimatroid> i'm no expert, but i know some stuff
2011-04-29T06:43:38  <mcstar> cin >> state;
2011-04-29T06:43:48  <mcstar> and state is a State struct
2011-04-29T06:43:56  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-29T06:44:17  <mcstar> what does >> mean here?
2011-04-29T06:44:25  <antimatroid> it's like cin >> myInt;
2011-04-29T06:44:32  <antimatroid> it's the input syntax for c++
2011-04-29T06:44:34  <mcstar> but state is a struct
2011-04-29T06:44:40  <mcstar> not a single variable
2011-04-29T06:44:48  <mcstar> what determines the input format?
2011-04-29T06:44:59  <antimatroid> the specs page :P
2011-04-29T06:45:32  <antimatroid> there is a function in State.cc "std::ostream& operator>>(std::ostream &os, const State &state)"
2011-04-29T06:45:33  <mcstar> ok bad question
2011-04-29T06:45:39  <mcstar> aha
2011-04-29T06:45:41  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-29T06:45:45  <antimatroid> which inputs information from an ostream os and reads it into state
2011-04-29T06:45:55  <mcstar> i see its overloaded
2011-04-29T06:46:07  <antimatroid> if you want to debug, you can have "game input" in a file, then use a file stream "ifstream file" and use "file >> state"
2011-04-29T06:46:24  <antimatroid> i absolutely love doing io using >> and <<
2011-04-29T06:46:35  <mcstar> i will not use the cpp starter kit
2011-04-29T06:46:44  <mcstar> just want to get a general idea what is does
2011-04-29T06:46:46  <antimatroid> you can also overload like state++ to increment states etc :)
2011-04-29T06:46:54  <antimatroid> yeah, i generally write my own starter package
2011-04-29T06:47:07  <mcstar> i mean i wont be using cpp >(
2011-04-29T06:47:08  <antimatroid> they are mostly there for people who aren't able/can't be bothered writing their on

2011-04-29T06:49:49  <antimatroid> although I used to just have the Bot struct stuff in main, but i like how it's done now
2011-04-29T06:50:10  <antimatroid> and i used to just use an ofstream for debugging, but now i can strip it all on compile easy

2011-04-29T07:04:06  <antimatroid> what has been for lunch so far?
2011-04-29T07:04:12  <sigh> also being able to snack throughout the day is good
2011-04-29T07:04:13  <sigh> hmmm
2011-04-29T07:04:31  <sigh> we had kangaroo the other day :)
2011-04-29T07:04:47  <antimatroid> i don't think i've ever had kangaroo

2011-04-29T07:05:28  <sigh> it's good when it's not overdone... i think it is hard to cook well in general
2011-04-29T07:06:53  <antimatroid> how's the work?
2011-04-29T07:08:25  <sigh> mostly I'm just floundering around in the code... so much to learn to understand how things work
2011-04-29T07:09:02  <sigh> the people are cool, they answer my endless stream of questions :P

2011-04-29T07:10:29  <antimatroid> sounds fun :P
2011-04-29T07:10:51  <antimatroid> i'm imagining you like the fish out of water in super mario brothers on snes
2011-04-29T07:11:17  <sigh> yeah, it's really fun :)
2011-04-29T07:11:33  <sigh> it's really cool learning how everything works behind the scenes
2011-04-29T07:12:56  <antimatroid> the internet really likes the big bang theory
2011-04-29T07:13:06  <antimatroid> i watch it because i get very bored, but i think it's awful
2011-04-29T07:13:21  <sigh> i like it
2011-04-29T07:13:44  <sigh> it's gotten a bit tiresome lately, but still
2011-04-29T07:14:48  <antimatroid> i will die when i have to work full time
2011-04-29T07:14:57  <sigh> :P
2011-04-29T07:15:08  <sigh> it's not too bad, you get used to it :)
2011-04-29T07:15:37  <antimatroid> yes, but when i eventually get to that point, it's going to be a big shock
2011-04-29T07:15:53  <sigh> what part specifically?
2011-04-29T07:16:29  <antimatroid> the long consecutive hours
2011-04-29T07:16:43  <antimatroid> thursdays i have 3 classes, that's my longest day for classes
2011-04-29T07:16:57  <antimatroid> i have 1 class on mondays, 2 wednesdays and none tuesdays and fridays
2011-04-29T07:17:21  <antimatroid> three hours of work in a row on tuesdays is painful :P
2011-04-29T07:18:34  <sigh> you'll have to get used to long consecutive hours before you reach the workforce if you are going to be a grad student :P
2011-04-29T07:20:39  <antimatroid> they don't have to be consecutive :P
2011-04-29T07:20:49  <antimatroid> i do a LOT of work, but not all at once
2011-04-29T07:21:48  <antimatroid> i was 1 unit shy of having done the equivalent of 5 years worth of units in 4 :(
2011-04-29T07:22:41  <sigh> :P
2011-04-29T07:23:03  <antimatroid> i can sort of count measure theory, but it's not on my record
2011-04-29T07:23:15  <antimatroid> and i didn't do assignments towards the end of semester as i didn't have time
2011-04-29T07:23:30  <sigh> well, at work it's not like you are working flat out continuously :)
2011-04-29T07:23:34  <antimatroid> i wanted to put it on my record, but the dean of science is an asshole
2011-04-29T07:23:45  <sigh> and plus you can mostly forget about it at the end of the day, unlike uni
2011-04-29T07:23:55  <antimatroid> wouldn't let us do 6 units in a semester, or count add a post grad unit to an undergrad transcript
2011-04-29T07:24:16  <sigh> :)
2011-04-29T07:24:17  <antimatroid> yeah, that's what i'm most envious about, not having to worry about it that much when you aren't there
2011-04-29T07:24:42  <antimatroid> that is the biggest thing that makes me want to not go down the academic road
2011-04-29T07:25:05  <sigh> have you done any internships?
2011-04-29T07:25:11  <antimatroid> nope :P
2011-04-29T07:25:24  <sigh> you should, if only to see what it's like
2011-04-29T07:25:31  <antimatroid> i don't really have time
2011-04-29T07:25:40  <sigh> gives you a better idea of what road you should head down
2011-04-29T07:26:04  <antimatroid> i am going to do masters in maths at anu next year, then either work for a bit or do a phd in maths at anu or in economics at uni of queensland (there's a really good game theorist there)
2011-04-29T07:26:36  <antimatroid> i applied for an rba internship the summer before last, but they didn't even interview me :(
2011-04-29T07:26:56  <sigh> apply to more than one place :P
2011-04-29T07:27:24  <antimatroid> although my boss suggests they were keen on people about to do honours (2 people from utas with far less maths and no programming got cadetships and now work there), but she could just be trying to make me feel better
2011-04-29T07:27:38  *** davidd <davidd!davidd@tinkywinky.stack.nl> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2011-04-29T07:27:40  <antimatroid> i did apply to rbnz for a similar thing, but same deal, no interview
2011-04-29T07:27:58  <antimatroid> but i did my summer research scholarship thing playing around with game theory instead, which i would have preferred anyway
2011-04-29T07:28:02  <sigh> hmm... get some people to review your resume and cover letter
2011-04-29T07:28:04  <antimatroid> except no real experience
2011-04-29T07:28:38  <antimatroid> i shall at some point
2011-04-29T07:28:45  <antimatroid> i had my boss go over it before sending it off
2011-04-29T07:28:55  <sigh> and seriously, learn how to sell yourself hard... there's not point holding back
2011-04-29T07:29:04  <antimatroid> ergh, i hate that
2011-04-29T07:29:33  <sigh> it's a skill, and you'll need it in academia as well
2011-04-29T07:30:03  <antimatroid> i'm more interested in evaluating people based on what they know rather than how they can sell themselves
2011-04-29T07:30:16  <antimatroid> i know it doesn't work like that, i just like to stick it to things i don't like
2011-04-29T07:30:21  <antimatroid> i'm very stubborn about such things :P
2011-04-29T07:30:35  <antimatroid> i do try to relax the stubborness for such things though
2011-04-29T07:30:38  <sigh> of course, but it is much easier if they make it very clear what they do know without you having to figure it out yourself
2011-04-29T07:30:40  <antimatroid> as i know it only hurts me
2011-04-29T07:32:00  <sigh> when I say that you should sell yourself, what I mean that you should make it blatantly obvious what you know and that you know it well
2011-04-29T07:32:22  <sigh> make it easy for people to evaluate what you know
2011-04-29T07:32:22  <antimatroid> i try to do that with whatevers relevant
2011-04-29T07:32:30  <antimatroid> i know some things quite well and a lot of things not very well
2011-04-29T07:32:44  <sigh> :)
2011-04-29T07:33:01  <antimatroid> but i can't really list every maths subject i've taken, excepting first year units i did enough for two majors
2011-04-29T07:33:45  <sigh> yeah... don't do that... the transcript is there for that if they want it
2011-04-29T07:34:39  <antimatroid> i thought i had a bad transcript
2011-04-29T07:34:51  <antimatroid> my friend has multiple pages of amendment notes
2011-04-29T07:35:02  <sigh> amendment notes?

2011-04-29T07:35:54  <antimatroid> permission to count honours units or a philosophy unit towards a major :P
2011-04-29T07:36:28  <antimatroid> i did more overloads than normal semesters
2011-04-29T07:36:31  <sigh> mostly it's just the courses you did and how you did in them that will matter if they decide to look at it
2011-04-29T07:36:52  <antimatroid> yeah i know, it's just fun having a ridiculous number of notes at the end :P
2011-04-29T07:37:06  <sigh> :)
2011-04-29T07:37:32  <antimatroid> i don't imagine people would care to look at my transcript for units very long either
2011-04-29T07:37:39  <antimatroid> it's rather long itself
2011-04-29T07:37:47  <antimatroid> and i did units all over the place
2011-04-29T07:38:45  <sigh> *shrug* some won't care, some will just look for the general trends, others might look at more specific things
2011-04-29T07:39:06  <sigh> but get someone to review your application
2011-04-29T07:39:45  <sigh> even if it is just to check that it makes sense, you have no idea how many resumes showed an obvious lack of proof reading when I was doing interviews
2011-04-29T07:41:16  <sigh> but assuming you get that part right, the review is important to ensure that what you have in your resume is what companies are looking for
2011-04-29T07:47:54  <antimatroid> :) yep
2011-04-29T07:47:57  <antimatroid> sorry got distracted :P

2011-04-29T17:08:44  <antimatroid> ah looks fun :)
2011-04-29T17:08:58  <antimatroid> protocolon must be getting excited
2011-04-29T17:08:58  <Barontrozo> we have also participate on MIT Ai contest, but we began to develop and we where tired very soon ....
2011-04-29T17:09:10  <antimatroid> that's java only yeah?
2011-04-29T17:09:16  <antimatroid> i refuse to touch java
2011-04-29T17:09:25  <antimatroid> have you looked at ants much?
2011-04-29T17:09:29  <Barontrozo> yes that was one of the reasons of our runout
2011-04-29T17:09:56  <Barontrozo> I have read the rules, but at this moments i'm really lost
2011-04-29T17:10:53  <Barontrozo> the most probable is that i'm going to do a dumy bot and see startegies of other people
2011-04-29T17:11:31  <antimatroid> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/index.php
2011-04-29T17:11:35  <antimatroid> there is a game on that page
2011-04-29T17:11:47  <antimatroid> although not with the current parameters
2011-04-29T17:11:50  <Barontrozo> yes i have seen tis page
2011-04-29T17:11:59  <Barontrozo> yes i have seen this page
2011-04-29T17:12:13  <Barontrozo> but I continue very very very lost
2011-04-29T17:12:30  <antimatroid> anything particularly confusing?
2011-04-29T17:12:36  <antimatroid> i wrote the specs page and the c++ bot
2011-04-29T17:12:43  <antimatroid> so i can answer questions on those :P
2011-04-29T17:12:55  <Barontrozo> there are a lot of fredom, so it's going to be dificult to develop a bot
2011-04-29T17:13:09  <antimatroid> freedom is good, people can go to town doing whatever they like
2011-04-29T17:13:18  <Barontrozo> yeah
2011-04-29T17:13:40  <Barontrozo> what i mean that i don't know how to began to develop my bot
2011-04-29T17:13:46  <Barontrozo> I understand the rules
2011-04-29T17:13:47  <antimatroid> food collection
2011-04-29T17:13:51  <antimatroid> everyone starts there
2011-04-29T17:14:06  <antimatroid> then you need to work out how to do battles
2011-04-29T17:14:18  <Barontrozo> but  at this moment I can not imagine what strategy implent
2011-04-29T17:14:29  <antimatroid> i have a neat little food collection thing
2011-04-29T17:15:39  <antimatroid> first set up a map of locations to when they are available, all ant locations start at 0, then iteratively scan out from non-collected food locations to find locations of available ants, pick the ant that can spawn the food square fastest, update information and keep collecting
2011-04-29T17:16:04  <Barontrozo> yeah, it seems that the important thing is to distribute uniformely your ants in your midle zone
2011-04-29T17:16:07  <antimatroid> you can then decide whether to collect food with just your ants or with enemies, and then work out how to send multiple ants from opposing bots that can arrive at the same time etc.
2011-04-29T17:16:30  <Barontrozo> but what is the best startegy on frontiers??????????
2011-04-29T17:16:44  <antimatroid> on his site? that's just hunterbot, it sucks :P
2011-04-29T17:17:01  <antimatroid> have you got a copy of everything off github?
2011-04-29T17:17:19  <Barontrozo> I have download it yesterday
2011-04-29T17:17:21  <antimatroid> you can play games using play_one_game.sh/bat and use copy_paste.html to view the games
2011-04-29T17:17:34  <Barontrozo> But I don't manage to get it work
2011-04-29T17:17:45  <Barontrozo> I'm a Windows user
2011-04-29T17:17:49  <antimatroid> you must use python  < 3
2011-04-29T17:17:55  <antimatroid> and play_one_game.bat should work
2011-04-29T17:18:04  <Barontrozo> and on windows the python scripts give some problems
2011-04-29T17:18:24  <antimatroid> i'm not the best person to ask there, but i think most problems have come from people using python >= 3
2011-04-29T17:18:49  <Barontrozo> Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
2011-04-29T17:19:02  <Barontrozo> i'm using 2.5.2
2011-04-29T17:19:15  <Barontrozo> I also have a Ubunto
2011-04-29T17:19:19  <Barontrozo> I also have a Ubuntu
2011-04-29T17:19:47  <Barontrozo> but on my linux machine I manage to complete a game, but i havent manage to visualize it
2011-04-29T17:20:24  <Barontrozo> so i was waiting for the first start package
2011-04-29T17:20:47  <antimatroid> when you run the game, a 0replay file is created in /viewer, paste its contents into copy_paste.html that's in /visualizer
2011-04-29T17:20:57  <antimatroid> the starter packages will make it easier eventually though
2011-04-29T17:21:10  <antimatroid> ask sigh sometime about getting it running on windows
2011-04-29T17:21:19  <antimatroid> he'd be asleep atm
2011-04-29T17:21:23  <antimatroid> (i should be asleep :P)
2011-04-29T17:21:52  <Barontrozo> don't worry
2011-04-29T17:22:07  <MatmaRex> i'm on windows too, maybe i can help?
2011-04-29T17:22:19  <Barontrozo> I'm going to wait to the first start package
2011-04-29T17:22:30  <Barontrozo> it's a long contest
2011-04-29T17:23:05  <Barontrozo> you where from australia, no????

2011-04-29T17:24:35  <antimatroid> we used to joke about digging through to china

2011-04-29T17:31:31  <McLeopold> yeah, going for that 88 was stupid
2011-04-29T17:31:40  <McLeopold> otherwise I had you
2011-04-29T17:31:52  <antimatroid> my bot had a sever problem of not finishing games
2011-04-29T17:32:56  <Barontrozo> ohh McLepold I'm looking back my particual figths with you and see this:
2011-04-29T17:33:00  <McLeopold> really, did you have a lot of timeouts?  or do you mean not finishing off the opponent

2011-04-29T17:33:39  <antimatroid> McLeopold: not finishing off the opponent
2011-04-29T17:33:43  <antimatroid> i had a few timeouts though
2011-04-29T17:33:51  <antimatroid> i'm really quite surprised my bot finished where it did
2011-04-29T17:33:57  <antimatroid> the tree was broken and had memory leaks
2011-04-29T17:34:23  <McLeopold> My final bot was really just an experiment of my main line that did really well.  It was geared toward maps where moving toward the enemy was the best option.
2011-04-29T17:34:24  <Barontrozo> yes my bot was plenty of faults also
2011-04-29T17:34:44  <McLeopold> So any map where you should wait and gather planets in the back, it did poorly
2011-04-29T17:34:58  <Barontrozo> The first time I sumited it, was in a poor place, but when i began to correct them, it began to get better results
2011-04-29T17:35:18  <McLeopold> I think most used some time of ships in X turns to calc the best neutrals to take, I didn't do that.
2011-04-29T17:35:45  <antimatroid> Barontrozo: have you looked at the symmetric maps for ants?
2011-04-29T17:35:49  <McLeopold> Which means I missed taking high cost growth 5 planets sometimes
2011-04-29T17:35:49  <antimatroid> that was my favourite problem so far
2011-04-29T17:36:39  <Barontrozo> I have seen only the map on the link you have paste
2011-04-29T17:37:05  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/maps
2011-04-29T17:38:26  <antimatroid> they're tesselations on a torus :)
2011-04-29T17:39:09  <antimatroid> you don't have symmetry of relative starting positions, not possible with more than 3 players, but otherwise it's symmetric
2011-04-29T17:39:31  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you ought to paste them to http://ants.zeroviz.us
2011-04-29T17:40:15  <antimatroid> mehffort
2011-04-29T17:40:29  <McLeopold> I'll work on that for you...
2011-04-29T17:40:44  <antimatroid> could that display it more like the actual visualiser :P
2011-04-29T17:40:58  <McLeopold> someday
2011-04-29T17:41:16  <McLeopold> I want random ants to play games on it as well, I'm working on a js port of the engine

2011-04-29T20:53:46  <mcstar> is somebody still awake?
2011-04-29T20:54:33  <mcstar> is there a better way to use the visualizer than to copy paste the replay file in the textbox?
2011-04-29T20:55:43  <mcstar> for example to give the filename as an argument when i open the html in a browser?
2011-04-29T20:56:46  <janzert> even though you're using a local html file it isn't allowed to read the contents of files from your computer
2011-04-29T20:57:04  <janzert> i.e. no I don't think currently there is a better way
2011-04-29T20:57:14  <mcstar> pfff
2011-04-29T20:57:20  <mcstar> kind of disappointing
2011-04-29T20:57:23  <janzert> there was some talk of a script that would start a small server that your browser would then access
2011-04-29T20:57:33  <janzert> but I don't know that it was ever done yet
2011-04-29T20:58:26  <mcstar> u know parameters can be specified in an url
2011-04-29T20:58:35  <mcstar> cant i pass that to the browser
2011-04-29T20:58:39  <mcstar> as part of the filename
2011-04-29T20:58:50  <mcstar> ant the scripty thingy would use that variable
2011-04-29T20:59:01  <mcstar> and it wont bother with the textbox
2011-04-29T20:59:10  <mcstar> but start visualizing right away?
2011-04-29T20:59:19  <janzert> the javascript in the visualizer can't read file content from you computer though
2011-04-29T21:00:15  <mcstar> im thinking of a nice cussing
2011-04-29T21:00:26  <mcstar> like fuck js or something
2011-04-29T21:00:28  <janzert> that is a restriction to ensure security in the browser
2011-04-29T21:00:58  <mcstar> so this is a general characteristic of js?
2011-04-29T21:01:17  <janzert> yes, well the browser security really
2011-04-29T21:01:23  <janzert> not js itself
2011-04-29T21:01:53  <mcstar> can js be run NOT in the browser?
2011-04-29T21:02:03  <mcstar> or that doesnt make much sense
2011-04-29T21:02:12  <mcstar> since the visualiztion is html 5
2011-04-29T21:02:17  <janzert> right
2011-04-29T21:02:29  <janzert> javascript itself can of course be run outside of browsers
2011-04-29T21:02:46  <mcstar> yeah but i wont be much use to us :)
2011-04-29T21:02:53  <mcstar> i->it
2011-04-29T21:02:55  <janzert> but the visualizer needs a browser since it is html+javascript
2011-04-29T21:02:57  <janzert> yep
2011-04-29T21:03:07  <janzert> at least not for running a visualizer ;)
2011-04-29T21:04:00  <mcstar> i cant remember what are the methods of passing data to a cgi engine
2011-04-29T21:04:11  <janzert> stdio
2011-04-29T21:04:12  <mcstar> theres one when u put it in the url
2011-04-29T21:04:15  <mcstar> whats the other?
2011-04-29T21:04:21  <janzert> oh, get and post requests?
2011-04-29T21:04:29  <janzert> http request types you mean?
2011-04-29T21:04:43  <mcstar> u mean in pure html
2011-04-29T21:04:48  <mcstar> u can have certain variables
2011-04-29T21:04:59  <mcstar> that u directly get from &var
2011-04-29T21:05:17  <mcstar> but theres another method to initialize those vars
2011-04-29T21:05:20  <mcstar> right?
2011-04-29T21:05:38  <mcstar> it was soo long ago i read about this
2011-04-29T21:05:55  <janzert> with a get request the variables are embedded in the url yes
2011-04-29T21:06:12  <janzert> with a post request they are given to the server in the body of the request
2011-04-29T21:06:51  <mcstar> but again, this has nothing to do with our situation
2011-04-29T21:06:55  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-29T21:07:00  <janzert> yep :)
2011-04-29T21:07:25  <mcstar> its pass 3 oclock here
2011-04-29T21:07:29  <mcstar> i neeed sleep

2011-04-29T22:33:16  <jaycobcoleman> It'll give names of all map files and bots for you to choose from
2011-04-29T22:33:29  <jaycobcoleman> as well as prompt you for other parameters
2011-04-29T22:33:57  <jaycobcoleman> which you can leave blank for a default value or type random for, obviously, random
2011-04-29T22:34:03  <jaycobcoleman> within reason of course :P

2011-04-29T22:44:22  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: the idea for the local games is that it's easy to do a ton of them in batch
2011-04-29T22:44:28  <amstan> so.. concentrate on command line options
2011-04-29T22:44:33  <amstan> it shouldn't prompt you for anything
2011-04-29T22:45:50  <antimatroid> that can't b e him
2011-04-29T22:46:04  <jaycobcoleman> Really I'd be making sort of an interactive tutorial
2011-04-29T22:46:25  <jaycobcoleman> help people understand what is necessary to run a match

2011-04-29T23:05:37  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: so.. there's not much you can do then
2011-04-29T23:05:43  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: you could write documentation for them
2011-04-29T23:10:40  <jaycobcoleman> At least for the sake of learning I'm going to toy with my original idea. I'll add game profiles so that game setups can be easily repeated
2011-04-29T23:13:17  <jaycobcoleman> perhaps an option to repeat a profile x number of times

2011-04-29T23:53:18  <amstan> jaycobcoleman: you still don't seem to be familiar with the unix way
2011-04-29T23:53:30  <amstan> the idea is that you have all these small tools, that do one thing, but do it well
2011-04-29T23:53:44  <amstan> so.. make the game engine do the game enginening well
2011-04-29T23:53:50  <amstan> and leave the UI for the website and for other scripts
2011-04-29T23:54:07  <amstan> if you want to have "profile", all you have to do is put your line from bash, in a .sh file
