2011-11-06T00:14:01  <amstan_> how does this map look? http://paste.aichallenge.org/NWFZ7/
2011-11-06T00:14:24  <amstan_> except the part where you can't access other hills

2011-11-06T00:15:38  <Rinum> interesting... so it's essentially 3 1v1 matches
2011-11-06T00:17:26  <Rinum> actually no ... 2 1v1 matches per bot
2011-11-06T00:18:52  <orange3> when will the rules (view/attack radius, etc.) and map generators be finalized?
2011-11-06T00:19:05  <amstan_> orange3: map generators, never
2011-11-06T00:19:16  <amstan_> orange3: rules, they're mostly finished, unlikely that they'll change
2011-11-06T00:19:44  <amstan_> orange3: you shouldn't be hardcoding your bot to those values though, use the params that you get
2011-11-06T00:19:57  <orange3> the generators themselves will never be finalized? (I don't mean the maps themselves, but the random distribution of maps)
2011-11-06T00:20:48  <amstan_> if someone comes with a new map generator in the last minute before results are shown, we'll might use new maps in the last few games
2011-11-06T00:20:55  <amstan_> we*
2011-11-06T00:21:14  <a1k0n> i think it's might be necessary to optimize around the current attackradius2 to have a bot that's any good.. altering that could have drastic consequences
2011-11-06T00:21:57  <antimatroid> a1kon: really?
2011-11-06T00:22:09  <antimatroid> i wouldn't have thought it'd be that hard to do state evaluation for a general attack radius
2011-11-06T00:22:21  <orange3> yeah, I'm taking the parameters as inputs, but I'm optimizing with the assumption that the attackradius2 or food gathering radius is unlikely to change..? (will those values ever be finalized or will it be assumed that those will be random as well..?)
2011-11-06T00:22:37  <antimatroid> you can construct translate values for attack radius in the 0th turn
2011-11-06T00:22:44  <a1k0n> it isn't, but the particular tactics change as you increase it
2011-11-06T00:22:45  <amstan_> orange3: that's fine
2011-11-06T00:23:03  <antimatroid> amstan_: they will be changed if the game is considered broken for any reason
2011-11-06T00:23:09  <antimatroid> that's why the parameters exist in the first place
2011-11-06T00:23:14  <amstan_> orange3: that ^
2011-11-06T00:23:18  <antimatroid> orange3: it is unideal for competitors and organisers if they change
2011-11-06T00:23:30  <antimatroid> but we reserve the right to change them if we consider that the best option
2011-11-06T00:23:38  <amstan_> antimatroid: what do you think? http://paste.aichallenge.org/NWFZ7/

2011-11-06T00:23:44  <amstan_> antimatroid: besides the part where you can't access some hills
2011-11-06T00:24:11  <antimatroid> amstan_: looks good, one other thing is do we want a minimum corridor width?
2011-11-06T00:24:18  <antimatroid> that isn't 1 :P
2011-11-06T00:24:26  <Antimony> you need a minimum of width 3 to prevent blocking
2011-11-06T00:24:33  <Antimony> when attackrad is 5
2011-11-06T00:24:37  <amstan_> is blocking a bad thing?
2011-11-06T00:24:39  <antimatroid> yes
2011-11-06T00:24:41  <Antimony> yes
2011-11-06T00:24:44  <antimatroid> leads to stale games
2011-11-06T00:24:49  <antimatroid> and games that can't end
2011-11-06T00:25:05  <antimatroid> i assume you're just carving those out? just carve with a 3x3 block
2011-11-06T00:25:07  <orange3> I see. but the rules should be finalized some time before submissions close correct? I believe we had similar issues with planet wars, where the map distributions suddenly changed last minute.. someone who tries to make their bot fit the case where the attackradius2 could be anywhere between 1 and 500 is going to likely have a weaker bot than someone who assumes it's 5 (if it actually stays at 5)
2011-11-06T00:25:30  <Antimony> yeah, the tactics are very sensitive to the precise value of attackrad
2011-11-06T00:25:30  <amstan_> antimatroid: https://plus.google.com/118210384829172301796/posts/15ewiYkbGKC
2011-11-06T00:25:38  <antimatroid> orange3: agreed, i am a proponent for general rules provided the rules are met to that generality
2011-11-06T00:25:38  <amstan_> orange3: yes
2011-11-06T00:25:44  <antimatroid> otherwise it comes down to who made the best assumptions
2011-11-06T00:25:50  <Antimony> attackrad=9 plays differently than 8 or 10
2011-11-06T00:26:16  <antimatroid> orange3: the current parameters wont change unless the game is literally found to be broken for some reason
2011-11-06T00:26:25  <Antimony> ok
2011-11-06T00:26:28  <a1k0n> even 6 would be a big change
2011-11-06T00:26:29  <antimatroid> and we've put a lot of thought into what would break it before actually starting this time
2011-11-06T00:26:31  <antimatroid> i think we're good
2011-11-06T00:26:36  <Antimony> 6 wouldn't change anything!
2011-11-06T00:26:37  <amstan_> orange3: in pw only the mapgen changed, you had no excuse if your bot crashed
2011-11-06T00:26:41  <Antimony> values 5-8 are equivalent
2011-11-06T00:26:43  <a1k0n> yeah it would
2011-11-06T00:26:50  <a1k0n> you have to check < attackradius2, not <=
2011-11-06T00:27:04  <Antimony> no it's <=
2011-11-06T00:27:24  * antimatroid gets back to his exam
2011-11-06T00:27:40  <a1k0n> what!
2011-11-06T00:27:51  <a1k0n> it better not be
2011-11-06T00:28:03  <amstan_> honeymatroid doesn't give a shit, he writes exams, and eww what's that? a blocked hill?
2011-11-06T00:28:20  <Antimony> does anyone try to keep track of food and mounds that they saw but are no longer visible?
2011-11-06T00:28:29  <antimatroid> amstan_: take home exams are both wonderful and gruelling :P
2011-11-06T00:28:36  <amstan_> antimatroid: lol
2011-11-06T00:28:51  <amstan_> antimatroid: well, good luck
2011-11-06T00:28:53  <Antimony> wow so many A usernames
2011-11-06T00:28:59  <antimatroid> haha yeah that's what i thought :P
2011-11-06T00:29:29  <orange3> I think the same (but slightly looser) argument can be made for the map generators. it's likely the strongest bot will still win given any generator, but we should have some rough frameworks for what to expect. otherwise again it's whoever makes the best assumptions..
2011-11-06T00:29:48  <amstan_> orange3: no.. you ruined the record now

2011-11-06T00:33:06  <a1k0n> god dammit, duh
2011-11-06T00:33:10  <Antimony> I guess I should just do a simple check now and worry about efficiency later
2011-11-06T00:33:22  <antimatroid> a1k0n: did within confuse you?
2011-11-06T00:33:36  <antimatroid> i was worried about that wording, i put a statement in the specs to define exactly what i meant

2011-11-06T01:26:53  <a1k0n> combat resolution.  yeah, it probably isn't complex enough to require it
2011-11-06T01:27:07  <a1k0n> but i don't know, he's so far ahead
2011-11-06T01:27:09  <_flag> For combat resolution it's certainly possible. I use something similar
2011-11-06T01:27:36  <_flag> He is, but I think it's more him simply doing all the little things very well
2011-11-06T01:27:58  <_flag> For example, he spreads out and explores much more efficiently than anyone else, and once you have more ants, you can basically do whatever you want

2011-11-06T01:49:29  <bobbydroptable> i know the feeling
2011-11-06T01:50:01  <praveen_> Can we apply any possible machine learning algo - Not sure what it would learn though. Did anybody try?
2011-11-06T01:50:24  <bobbydroptable> lets see, the max average temperature in victoria summer 2011 was 25.5c =="
2011-11-06T01:52:41  <bobbydroptable> praveen_ you could possibly write a learning bot, but you must only teach it locally
2011-11-06T01:52:55  <bobbydroptable> since you cannot persist information between games on the actual live server
2011-11-06T01:53:17  <bobbydroptable> so you could possibly teach it using the TCP servers
2011-11-06T01:53:31  <praveen_> Can we do this. if we can get the logs of all the games played, its possible to use that as training data
2011-11-06T01:53:48  <bobbydroptable> as long as it is within the upload limit, shouldn't be a problem
2011-11-06T01:54:03  <praveen_> And learn something like, when to attack and when to defend - kind of
2011-11-06T01:54:07  <bobbydroptable> and also, your bot has to process your training data at the beginning of every game , which could take a while
2011-11-06T01:54:44  <Rinum> I don't think ML would work well on this one
2011-11-06T01:54:46  <praveen_> Yeah
2011-11-06T01:55:18  <praveen_> Rinum: I think the difficulty lies in the question - "What would you possible learn and how"
2011-11-06T01:55:46  <Rinum> yup
2011-11-06T01:55:57  <bobbydroptable> if you use collaborative diffusion
2011-11-06T01:56:10  <bobbydroptable> you could use machine learning to determine the best parameters for the diffusion
2011-11-06T01:56:11  <amstan_> why don't people learn from replays instead of tcp?
2011-11-06T01:56:39  <bobbydroptable> amstan_ isn't the point of TCP to generate replays?
2011-11-06T01:57:07  <amstan_> i guess, but the games there are a little different
2011-11-06T01:57:14  <praveen_> Yes - I am not much aware of Colloborative diffusion  - Let me try to read.
2011-11-06T01:57:17  <amstan_> might make a difference for the gameophiles
2011-11-06T01:57:47  <bobbydroptable> well you could design contrived scenarios and see how your bot reacts
2011-11-06T01:57:53  <bobbydroptable> but its a bit hard to fiddle with the map files
2011-11-06T01:58:07  <praveen_> Thanks for pointing out. Thats a good starting point.

2011-11-06T01:12:16  <stocha> what's up ?
2011-11-06T01:12:23  <mcstar> not much
2011-11-06T01:12:25  <stocha> any bot do you have now ? :p
2011-11-06T01:12:29  <mcstar> sure
2011-11-06T01:12:37  <mcstar> working on it
2011-11-06T01:12:38  <stocha> i forget it's name.
2011-11-06T01:12:42  <mcstar> its new
2011-11-06T01:12:46  <stocha> what's your bot name ?
2011-11-06T01:12:47  <mcstar> AgentSmith
2011-11-06T01:14:12  <mcstar> i read upon c++11, has some very nice features indeed
2011-11-06T01:14:23  <mcstar> im recommending every c++ programmer to take a look
2011-11-06T01:14:33  <stocha> what is the bot rating ? (only 7 games so far)
2011-11-06T01:14:45  <stocha> i mean what rating doyou expect for it
2011-11-06T01:14:53  <mcstar> oh, not too good
2011-11-06T01:15:02  <mcstar> has no knowledge of hills
2011-11-06T01:15:08  <mcstar> will be corected today
2011-11-06T01:15:10  <mcstar> i think
2011-11-06T01:15:20  <mcstar> i was experimenting with game trees yesterday
2011-11-06T01:16:17  <stocha> I picked almost randomly one of my old bot (it assumes the old rules, without hills). It is on first page. It was like 40th in the old beta.
2011-11-06T01:16:43  <mcstar> my similar bot reached 37th at the end of old beta
2011-11-06T01:16:54  <mcstar> but that was in cl
2011-11-06T01:17:02  <mcstar> this is in c++, and i think it is better tuned
2011-11-06T01:17:15  <stocha> do you do a bit of combat ?
2011-11-06T01:17:30  <mcstar> well, thats what i was working on it yesterday
2011-11-06T01:17:42  <stocha> I never submited a bot with combat awarness yet.
2011-11-06T01:17:50  <mcstar> me neither
2011-11-06T01:17:58  <mcstar> just tries to stay away from enemy a bit
2011-11-06T01:18:04  <antimatroid> i suspect lots of people are working on combat but haven't submitted it yet
2011-11-06T01:18:11  <mcstar> antimatroid: hey
2011-11-06T01:18:13  <stocha> i'm building a new developpement framework. Once it's done, i'll decide if i submit a bot or not. (i doubt i'll have much time).
2011-11-06T01:18:13  <antimatroid> it will be interesting once lots more combat aware bots are up
2011-11-06T01:18:20  <mcstar> c++11 has great features
2011-11-06T01:18:21  <antimatroid> mcstar: hey
2011-11-06T01:18:29  <antimatroid> i've not looked at it yet
2011-11-06T01:18:31  <mcstar> it feels almost as language one could like
2011-11-06T01:18:34  <mcstar> a*
2011-11-06T01:18:35  <antimatroid> :P
2011-11-06T01:18:45  <ecarpenter84> im trying to work out general goal testing before i do game trees / combat indepth

2011-11-06T01:19:14  <mcstar> stocha: yeah
2011-11-06T01:19:26  <mcstar> well, its only late roughly 30 years
2011-11-06T01:19:27  <stocha> ecarpenter84: how do you guys find time for game trees ? I don't even find enougth time without combat awarness ...
2011-11-06T01:19:42  <stocha> i mean from the 500 ms
2011-11-06T01:20:06  <stocha> mcstar: what does 11 bring to the table ?
2011-11-06T01:20:17  <ecarpenter84> i imagine some alpha beta pruning with a very good evaluation heuristic
2011-11-06T01:20:28  <mcstar> my benchmark shows that i can do a 2-turn tree for simple situations in couple of ms's
2011-11-06T01:20:41  <stocha> ecarpenter84: did you try it yet ?
2011-11-06T01:20:57  <stocha> mcstar: how many ants does that involves ?
2011-11-06T01:21:09  <stocha> how do one do alphabeta with simultaneous turns ?
2011-11-06T01:21:11  <ecarpenter84> you would only use it on the ants that need it the most
2011-11-06T01:21:18  <mcstar> stocha: what i am most excited about is the auto keyword, new for on ranges, and lambdas and closures
2011-11-06T01:21:48  <stocha> is c++11 a functional oriented language ?
2011-11-06T01:21:54  <mcstar> it is c++
2011-11-06T01:22:00  <mcstar> the latest standard
2011-11-06T01:22:09  <praveen_> Do you guys splits the ants into groups like explorers, attack enemy, raze hills?
2011-11-06T01:22:10  <ecarpenter84> you can meta evaluate
2011-11-06T01:22:19  <ecarpenter84> compute about what to compute
2011-11-06T01:22:31  <ecarpenter84> only the ants nearest to enemies get evaluated with A/B pruning
2011-11-06T01:22:37  <stocha> praveen_: i certainly would like to try that. But i didn't so far.

2011-11-06T01:23:36  <ecarpenter84> alpha beta pruning is just a faster version of minimax

2011-11-06T01:28:44  <ecarpenter84> you could evaluate the "strength" of the nearest ant
2011-11-06T01:28:46  <pek> any chance we can get the source code of the visualizer?
2011-11-06T01:28:49  <stocha> it's stocha_Exp40 there
2011-11-06T01:28:52  <ecarpenter84> to be the # of ants within a radius of 2?
2011-11-06T01:29:04  <ecarpenter84> and your starting strength as a similar heuristic
2011-11-06T01:29:57  <mcstar> ecarpenter84: im doing full battle resoltion
2011-11-06T01:30:00  <mcstar> resolution
2011-11-06T01:30:09  <mcstar> doesnt cost much

2011-11-06T01:30:23  <stocha> in find this idea of evaluating one ant strength quite interesting.
2011-11-06T01:30:42  <mcstar> i will try to have a heuristic cost function on top of that
2011-11-06T01:31:08  <stocha> is there some standard alphabeta implementation for java that i could use ? :p
2011-11-06T01:31:27  <ecarpenter84> mcstar: you can compute about what to compute. on important/key ants you can use a game tree to evaluate the best way to obtain a key objective
2011-11-06T01:31:31  <stocha> i don't really feel like tuning one, if i'm not sure i will use it in the end :p
2011-11-06T01:31:44  <ecarpenter84> you wouldnt need that "high res" image on every ant
2011-11-06T01:31:47  <ecarpenter84> or even every combat ant

2011-11-06T01:32:08  <mcstar> even with a-b
2011-11-06T01:32:11  <ecarpenter84> just maybe ants near enemy nodes to try to slip around defense / defend your base

2011-11-06T01:32:53  <ecarpenter84> just the right ones

2011-11-06T01:33:46  <stocha> ecarpenter84: thanks. I might try it.
2011-11-06T01:33:49  <ecarpenter84> well find out the cost in it
2011-11-06T01:33:57  <ecarpenter84> then evalute what you can afford to
2011-11-06T01:34:10  <ecarpenter84> if you can only afford 1-3 ants at a ply of 2 or 3

2011-11-06T01:34:35  <ecarpenter84> you can dynamically change # of a-b ants / # of plies
2011-11-06T01:34:52  <ecarpenter84> i just started the content
2011-11-06T01:34:56  <praveen_> stocha: You rank 67. Is that really exploration + shortest path for food? You should be having really nice implementation then
2011-11-06T01:34:59  <ecarpenter84> though ive done AI programming before

2011-11-06T01:35:24  <mcstar> oh i have to tell this
2011-11-06T01:35:29  <stocha> praveen_: there is a lot of room for improvement. On the tcp server my most simple bot did better than this one.
2011-11-06T01:35:36  <ecarpenter84> i haven't implemented anything on the server yet other then bfs for 7 goals then diffusing the maps and passing that to all ants
2011-11-06T01:35:37  <mcstar> i woke up at 5:44
2011-11-06T01:35:47  <mcstar> and my pc was turned on for the night
2011-11-06T01:35:52  <ecarpenter84> and im timing out so i just added code to break loops ;rightnow base don  tiem remaing

2011-11-06T01:36:11  <mcstar> stupid village turned off the power
2011-11-06T01:36:22  <stocha> praveen_: although i would advise to put half your time for strategy (exploration tuning) and half for tactic (combat awarness)

2011-11-06T01:37:04  <praveen_> stocha: yes exploration is must. But rather combat tuning if we concentrate on exploration + food more, we dont need to combat. More ants can take care itself right
2011-11-06T01:37:37  <praveen_> stocha: just send more ants to raze a hill
2011-11-06T01:37:39  <stocha> mcstar: how strong is ecarpenter bot ?
2011-11-06T01:37:53  <mcstar> he didt say which is his
2011-11-06T01:38:08  <mcstar> ok, same nick :D
2011-11-06T01:38:15  <mcstar> -0.00
2011-11-06T01:38:21  <stocha> praveen_: it does if you don't plan to be in the top bots. but if you do, you'd better start working on battle resolution.
2011-11-06T01:38:39  <mcstar> hah, python, and version 12
2011-11-06T01:38:45  <mcstar> and he said he just joined?
2011-11-06T01:39:10  <stocha> mcstar: i don't know. but you can be version 30 if you had hard time compiling.
2011-11-06T01:39:17  <stocha> with only one submission.
2011-11-06T01:39:28  <mcstar> not the case
2011-11-06T01:39:48  <mcstar> he never reached skill 40
2011-11-06T01:40:10  <mcstar> but probably he soon will :D
2011-11-06T01:40:17  <stocha> praveen_: i know for sure that those interested in strategy will eventually always have something to do first before the get into tactic. until it's too late :p
2011-11-06T01:41:06  <stocha> praveen_: combat aware bots just tend to wipe combat unaware bots with no losses.
2011-11-06T01:41:41  <fasteddie_> the bots on the tcp server are a lot better than those on the official server
2011-11-06T01:42:25  <a1k0n> oh man, i just let my entire army get wiped out by two ants again: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.22619
2011-11-06T01:42:43  <a1k0n> fasteddie_: yes, by far.  it's kinda frustrating how good they are
2011-11-06T01:42:45  <praveen_> stocha: am watching many replays to see what the combat aware bots do. As you said, they use simple formation and attack. atleast this level is required
2011-11-06T01:42:55  <pairofdice> Must make ants less stupid
2011-11-06T01:43:31  <mcstar> write down this a 100 times
2011-11-06T01:43:42  <pairofdice> My ants like to walk in a single file into death
2011-11-06T01:43:45  <praveen_> stocha: here we have a1k0n got wiped out. That answers a lot
2011-11-06T01:44:05  <stocha> a1k0n: no combat resolution ?
2011-11-06T01:44:09  <a1k0n> some kind of bug where i let ants in the back push ahead of the "line"
2011-11-06T01:44:13  <a1k0n> oh i have combat resolution now
2011-11-06T01:44:28  <a1k0n> i don't think the ant at the front of the line wanted to be there
2011-11-06T01:44:39  <analyst74> lol
2011-11-06T01:45:02  <pairofdice> :)
2011-11-06T01:45:06  <analyst74> and tcp server yes, I hardly get any real feedback on whether my bot improved or not .. it always get creamed. :/
2011-11-06T01:45:16  <a1k0n> but yeah i did some pretty good hunting until turn 1044 or so
2011-11-06T01:45:59  <mcstar> blue had a nice defense
2011-11-06T01:46:16  <stocha> a1k0n: do you use trees for combat ?
2011-11-06T01:46:26  <a1k0n> i think orange could have taken them down though
2011-11-06T01:46:30  <a1k0n> stocha: nope
2011-11-06T01:46:38  <a1k0n> just one-move lookahead
2011-11-06T01:46:43  <mcstar> a1k0n: orange was suiciding in front of blue

2011-11-06T01:49:48  <stocha> praveen_: probably because it gets beserk once close to hills.
2011-11-06T01:50:38  <stocha> analyst74: maybe if more weak bots play there, more will try to put weak bot in there. Although most probably weak bots won't stay weak long.

2011-11-06T02:08:22  <bobbydroptable> hehe yeh i might use that as my new online psuedonym
2011-11-06T02:09:52  <analyst74> did you read that collaborative diffusion thing on forum?
2011-11-06T02:10:18  <bobbydroptable> no i read someone post it though
2011-11-06T02:10:20  <pairofdice> Now when my ants get next to each other they stop and hug.
2011-11-06T02:10:22  <bobbydroptable> that's what i've been trying to do
2011-11-06T02:10:28  <pairofdice> For the rest of the game
2011-11-06T02:10:29  <bobbydroptable> but with a simplified coefficient
2011-11-06T02:10:46  <bobbydroptable> (just +-1 between tiles)
2011-11-06T02:11:04  <bobbydroptable> but then my ants just swarm about trying to get to the closest goal
2011-11-06T02:11:15  <pairofdice> Yeah
2011-11-06T02:11:32  <analyst74> once you got the base framework right, you can start tweaking variables, prioritizations
2011-11-06T02:11:48  <bobbydroptable> they try to get to, say, the nearest unexplored area
2011-11-06T02:11:52  <analyst74> sometimes little changes in prioritization would make major difference
2011-11-06T02:12:27  <bobbydroptable> then the costs rebalance out, and now they turn about and try to get to another unexplored tile
2011-11-06T02:13:04  <analyst74> that sounds about right
2011-11-06T02:13:10  <stocha> bobbydroptable: hi.

2011-11-06T02:17:45  <pairofdice> I hunt bugs blindfolded with a shotgun

2011-11-06T02:18:14  <bobbydroptable> is that the diffusion center starts to shift
2011-11-06T02:18:23  <bobbydroptable> then my ants start getting all confused
2011-11-06T02:18:31  <bobbydroptable> and do the death shuffle

2011-11-06T02:20:20  <stocha> even you still end up doign 95% of your time hunting bugs. It's just a different kind of hunting.
2011-11-06T02:20:24  <mcstar> it sounds too much like skip-lists
2011-11-06T02:20:31  <mcstar> and i want to read up on them
2011-11-06T02:21:19  <stocha> bobbydroptable: it's interesting. But different. You can't be a gestion programming specialist in only one month.
2011-11-06T02:22:07  <pairofdice> Okay, my dispersion isn't working at all...
2011-11-06T02:22:22  <pairofdice> Which is a bit curious...
2011-11-06T02:22:42  <mcstar> pairofdice: my secret is to use the previous positions of the ants as influence for this turn's diffusion
2011-11-06T02:22:46  <stocha> pairofdice: what do you use for dispertion ?
2011-11-06T02:23:16  <stocha> mcstar: what do you mean ?
2011-11-06T02:23:27  <pairofdice> I use basically the same BFS as I use for food
2011-11-06T02:23:34  <pairofdice> Just different values
2011-11-06T02:23:37  <bobbydroptable> you penalise the score of the previous location of the ant
2011-11-06T02:23:41  <mcstar> stocha: there are things i cant formulate in a simpler way
2011-11-06T02:23:55  <bobbydroptable> which reduces the chance of it being chosen as the best destination for the ant for that turn
2011-11-06T02:24:22  <bobbydroptable> maybe that will work ... i will chuck it in, see what it does
2011-11-06T02:24:35  <stocha> are your destination score just around the ant, or can they be far away from it ?

2011-11-06T02:39:49  <bobbydroptable> to minimise the swarming
2011-11-06T02:46:43  <analyst74> would be useful in faster expansion, although you will lose the side-benefit of formation combat

2011-11-06T02:47:37  <bobbydroptable> perhaps if i could find a way to combine task oriented ants with diffusion
2011-11-06T02:48:09  <bobbydroptable> i basically just need a way to allocate goals to different ants so that ants that are supposed to swarm will swarm, and those that aren't won't.

2011-11-06T02:50:40  <bobbydroptable> the other way, which i would prefer, but no idea how to do, would be to dynamically generate network graph as I expand out from my hills

2011-11-06T03:17:34  <mcstar> that is usually not bad, those are the fast directions anyway
2011-11-06T03:17:45  <mcstar> but behaves nicely around water
2011-11-06T03:17:51  <mcstar> and spreads well
2011-11-06T03:19:01  <mcstar> oh, i mean the 4 main directions, i.e. it likes to travel staright, not very jaggedly
2011-11-06T03:19:19  <mcstar> but i didnt notice it would prefer north over south or east over west

2011-11-06T03:23:02  <pairofdice> Sometimes when my ants are in a long corridor they start to oscillate perpendicular to where they should be going....
2011-11-06T03:23:19  <pairofdice> Well, when there's more than one ant in a line
2011-11-06T03:23:19  <bobbydroptable> are you using diffusion as well?
2011-11-06T03:23:34  <bobbydroptable> that's usually a sign that you have a tie in your scores
2011-11-06T03:23:35  <pairofdice> I am trying to
2011-11-06T03:24:01  <mcstar> what is the period of the oscillation?
2011-11-06T03:26:13  <pairofdice> Every turn
2011-11-06T03:26:58  <mcstar> ok, thats an error, i thought they  might oscillate in the whole length of the corridor
2011-11-06T03:27:11  <bobbydroptable> i call it the death shuffle
2011-11-06T03:27:13  <bobbydroptable> lol
2011-11-06T03:27:33  <mcstar> actually it never happened to me

2011-11-06T04:12:09  <analyst74> so I maintain a map with values, and I use pickle to serialize them every turn
2011-11-06T04:12:16  <bobbydroptable> what's pickle?
2011-11-06T04:12:26  <analyst74> it's a python module, serialize objects

2011-11-06T04:12:31  <bobbydroptable> oh.
2011-11-06T04:12:54  <analyst74> as simple as pickle.dump(<your 2d map>, file_handle)
2011-11-06T04:13:16  <analyst74> so I end up with hundreds of pickle files, containing serialized influence map for that turn

2011-11-06T04:33:55  <analyst74> for the few parts I needed performance (lot of get/set operations on map values), I find dict to be fastest
2011-11-06T04:33:57  <mcstar> i broke my bot
2011-11-06T04:34:08  <bobbydroptable> mine's never worked ^_^
2011-11-06T04:34:24  <mcstar> analyst74: theres nothing faster than a vector
2011-11-06T04:34:32  <mcstar> because you index it by location
2011-11-06T04:34:39  <mcstar> that is constant time
2011-11-06T04:35:00  <mcstar> a dict is a hashtable, you index it by key
2011-11-06T04:35:06  <mcstar> that is nlogn i think
2011-11-06T04:35:24  <analyst74> that's O(1), if the implementation is good
2011-11-06T04:35:55  <analyst74> but I might do some testing with vector
2011-11-06T04:36:18  <mcstar> ah k, my bad
2011-11-06T04:36:28  <mcstar> O(1) to O(n)
2011-11-06T04:36:37  <mcstar> but a vector is still faster
2011-11-06T04:36:48  <mcstar> of course only when you index by key
2011-11-06T04:36:52  <mcstar> i.e. you dont have to search

2011-11-06T05:37:44  <RasmusL> i've implemented A* and it works, but at some point it just gets stuck and timeouts :/
2011-11-06T05:37:53  <RasmusL> and it's not because it's slow, it's stuck somehow
2011-11-06T05:38:24  <mcstar> it happends
2011-11-06T05:38:27  <mcstar> -d
2011-11-06T05:38:41  <RasmusL> i don't think it should though
2011-11-06T05:38:56  <RasmusL> it happens in really simple situations, like at turn 4 or something
2011-11-06T05:39:26  <mcstar> what i meant is that people write bad code
2011-11-06T05:39:34  <RasmusL> lol
2011-11-06T05:39:34  <mcstar> it happens
2011-11-06T05:39:37  <RasmusL> yeah i probably do :)
2011-11-06T05:39:57  <mcstar> there are many pythoners here, they will help you
2011-11-06T05:40:43  <mcstar> RasmusL: anyway, try displaying/outputting intermediate state/results
2011-11-06T05:40:52  <mcstar> to see what really happens, thats the first step
2011-11-06T05:41:15  <mcstar> probably you dont understand the algorithm fully(not a*, your implementation)
2011-11-06T05:41:43  <RasmusL> is it ok to create a log file?
2011-11-06T05:41:55  <mcstar> yes, but you shouldnt
2011-11-06T05:42:10  <mcstar> use stderr, the engine can make a file of it if you want
2011-11-06T05:44:52  <bobbydroptable> you can , just make sure you have a debug flag set so that it doesn't do it on the server
2011-11-06T05:45:01  <bobbydroptable> i use file logging for visualizing my maps
2011-11-06T05:45:23  <RasmusL> i see
2011-11-06T05:45:42  <bobbydroptable> because you're not allowed to do it on the server
2011-11-06T05:45:48  <mcstar> actually, it doesnt matter
2011-11-06T05:46:04  <mcstar> once i left a code in my upload that wrote images every turn
2011-11-06T05:46:09  <mcstar> i noticed no problems
2011-11-06T05:46:21  <bobbydroptable> might get disqualified in the end though?
2011-11-06T05:46:28  <mcstar> i dont think so
2011-11-06T05:46:37  <mcstar> your write will simply fail
2011-11-06T05:46:42  <marijnfs> rasmus: how do you keep the priority list?
2011-11-06T05:46:44  <bobbydroptable> i guess
2011-11-06T05:46:50  <mcstar> but it can depend per language what happens than
2011-11-06T05:46:51  <marijnfs> do you sort every time?
2011-11-06T05:46:56  <bobbydroptable> if it's just a permissions thing, and you've got exception handling
2011-11-06T05:46:59  <marijnfs> because that can be slow
2011-11-06T05:47:06  <RasmusL> i don't sort at all currently
2011-11-06T05:47:11  <RasmusL> just a heap
2011-11-06T05:47:11  <marijnfs> use a heap or something
2011-11-06T05:47:14  <RasmusL> ya
2011-11-06T05:47:26  <RasmusL> im using heapq
2011-11-06T05:47:26  <marijnfs> and sort it the right way;)
2011-11-06T05:47:49  <mcstar> i think his alg. is simply not working, right RasmusL
2011-11-06T05:47:51  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-06T05:48:07  <RasmusL> where does stderr go when i run the bot locally?
2011-11-06T05:48:15  <mcstar> to stderr
2011-11-06T05:48:19  <RasmusL> lol
2011-11-06T05:48:21  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-11-06T05:48:26  <RasmusL> i mean how do i see it
2011-11-06T05:48:31  <mcstar> you just do
2011-11-06T05:48:36  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-06T05:48:48  <mcstar> goes where stdout goes
2011-11-06T05:48:49  <RasmusL> anyways yeah i think my alg is somehow wrong
2011-11-06T05:48:52  <RasmusL> gotta figure out how
2011-11-06T05:49:41  <marijnfs> there cant be so many things
2011-11-06T05:49:46  <marijnfs> either you sort wrong
2011-11-06T05:49:59  <marijnfs> or dont have the right ending logic
2011-11-06T05:50:41  <marijnfs> or wrong expanding logic

2011-11-06T05:51:44  <marijnfs> yeah how do you handle unreachable situations?
2011-11-06T05:52:01  <marijnfs> you should keep a closed list or map of booleans or something

2011-11-06T06:06:26  <RasmusL> i should?
2011-11-06T06:06:37  <RasmusL> well it does assume that it is reachable..
2011-11-06T06:06:43  <marijnfs> yeah it hashes but if it also contains the distance traveled or whatever it doesnt really work

2011-11-06T06:11:39  <RasmusL> ahh
2011-11-06T06:11:41  <marijnfs> no you can check it when popping
2011-11-06T06:11:44  <RasmusL> yeah i gotta add that
2011-11-06T06:11:47  <marijnfs> like you do now
2011-11-06T06:11:55  <RasmusL> well i guess.. but wouldnt it be better to not push it?

2011-11-06T06:13:42  <mcstar> theres a possibility that you add a child to the queue that is already visited
2011-11-06T06:13:43  <bobbydroptable> still, quite a nice shape
2011-11-06T06:13:55  <mcstar> it can throw off the algorithm

2011-11-06T06:14:18  <bobbydroptable> mcstar: its a minor niggle, but he does check if it is in the visited set
2011-11-06T06:14:19  <mcstar> because you dont check for it
2011-11-06T06:14:19  <marijnfs> it just will be popped and discarded
2011-11-06T06:14:52  <bobbydroptable> though it does cause more work for the sorting
2011-11-06T06:14:59  <bobbydroptable> since it has to sort redundant stuff

2011-11-06T06:20:09  <knott> (PL is java)
2011-11-06T06:20:45  <RasmusL> i'd help but i don't do java
2011-11-06T06:21:29  <knott> ok
2011-11-06T06:22:20  <mcstar> marijnfs: i got confused, i do it without a visited set and it breaks my algorithm if i were to include a non-pristine child
2011-11-06T06:22:23  <knott> i dont have for now any linux environment and thus cool things as Make too
2011-11-06T06:22:50  <bobbydroptable> knott: just create new project with eclipse and import the files in.
2011-11-06T06:22:59  <knott> There are present any auto build env for win ?
2011-11-06T06:23:17  <marijnfs> what is non-pristine?
2011-11-06T06:23:20  <bobbydroptable> nope only source files for starter packs
2011-11-06T06:23:32  <marijnfs> unreachable?
2011-11-06T06:23:35  <bobbydroptable> you have to figure out how to build the sources yourself for the most part
2011-11-06T06:23:37  <knott> yep i did it
2011-11-06T06:24:10  <knott> i want to easily run bot to see results
2011-11-06T06:24:55  <knott> for example: i push "Run" button and visualization program runs and shows me the results

2011-11-06T06:25:53  <mcstar> it is a tile, that has no g-value
2011-11-06T06:26:38  <bobbydroptable> knott you can't
2011-11-06T06:26:45  <bobbydroptable> because the main engine is in Python
2011-11-06T06:26:46  <bobbydroptable> not in java
2011-11-06T06:26:51  <bobbydroptable> you have to install python first
2011-11-06T06:26:53  <knott> ouch
2011-11-06T06:26:57  <bobbydroptable> and run the engine, and point it to your java bot
2011-11-06T06:27:15  <knott> i thought it written with java or so on
2011-11-06T06:27:24  <knott> ye i have python already

2011-11-06T06:28:50  <marijnfs> mcstar: i dont understand, so the g should be 0 only for the starting square right?
2011-11-06T06:28:56  <marijnfs> any step should add some cost
2011-11-06T06:29:07  <marijnfs> and increase g in the next step
2011-11-06T06:29:11  <mcstar> marijnfs: actually, all my g's are -1 at the start
2011-11-06T06:29:14  <bobbydroptable> that's technically true
2011-11-06T06:29:26  <bobbydroptable> but since cost is constant they can be safely disregarded
2011-11-06T06:29:28  <mcstar> thats how i know if i considered that tile or not
2011-11-06T06:29:37  <bobbydroptable> (every step is 1)
2011-11-06T06:29:44  <marijnfs> you have to add cost otherwise the sorting will not work
2011-11-06T06:29:54  <mcstar> there is no sorting
2011-11-06T06:30:06  <bobbydroptable> that's what the heuristic is for

2011-11-06T06:30:09  <marijnfs> you use a heap right?
2011-11-06T06:30:11  <bobbydroptable> i'm assuming iti s A*
2011-11-06T06:30:12  <mcstar> no
2011-11-06T06:30:19  <mcstar> no point in using a heap
2011-11-06T06:30:29  <mcstar> i use a circular ring as a queue
2011-11-06T06:30:36  <mcstar> thats for the open set
2011-11-06T06:30:38  <marijnfs> ok so you do bfs?
2011-11-06T06:30:45  <marijnfs> or what?
2011-11-06T06:30:45  <bobbydroptable> isn't a ring by definition an circle? lol
2011-11-06T06:30:48  <mcstar> ype, dijkstra
2011-11-06T06:31:00  <knott> mcstar: the way described on the site - is command-line way. I like it, but not in Windows. I thought there are any solutions already for this.
2011-11-06T06:31:18  <mcstar> bobbydroptable: circular queue
2011-11-06T06:31:20  <bobbydroptable> knott : you run it on the command line, the results are shown in browser.
2011-11-06T06:31:23  <bobbydroptable> mcstar: joke.
2011-11-06T06:31:33  <knott> yep i got it
2011-11-06T06:31:52  <mcstar> knott: just install cygwin, and you will start to like the command line
2011-11-06T06:31:55  <bobbydroptable> knott you could just make a shortcut for it so you can double click it instead?
2011-11-06T06:33:04  <marijnfs> mcstar: but you have to sort the unvisited nodes right?
2011-11-06T06:33:14  <pairofdice> Like the tutorial instructs you to paste the commands into a .cmd
2011-11-06T06:33:15  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-06T06:33:17  <marijnfs> you have to take the unvisited node with lowest value-thingy
2011-11-06T06:33:17  <mcstar> no
2011-11-06T06:33:23  <mcstar> no
2011-11-06T06:33:25  <bobbydroptable> you're still thinking A*
2011-11-06T06:33:39  <mcstar> yo only need a priority queue for a*
2011-11-06T06:33:48  <mcstar> otherwise, the heuristic wouldnt matter
2011-11-06T06:33:53  <marijnfs> The next current node will be the node marked with
2011-11-06T06:33:57  <marijnfs> the lowest (tentative) distance in the unvisited set.
2011-11-06T06:34:01  <marijnfs> i mean that part
2011-11-06T06:34:06  <bobbydroptable> i'm confused
2011-11-06T06:34:12  <bobbydroptable> i'm going to step out of this discussion lol

2011-11-06T06:34:45  <mcstar> marijnfs: bfs or dijsktar check all tiles up to a given length, before it increses its search length
2011-11-06T06:34:49  <mcstar> thats why its bfs
2011-11-06T06:34:58  <mcstar> theres no sorting/priorities
2011-11-06T06:36:08  <marijnfs> it is not just bfs
2011-11-06T06:36:13  <marijnfs> it has some selection going on
2011-11-06T06:36:13  <mcstar> thats too general
2011-11-06T06:36:17  <marijnfs> thats why it is dijkstra
2011-11-06T06:36:21  <mcstar> those edges can have any weight
2011-11-06T06:36:30  <mcstar> but here all edges has weight 1
2011-11-06T06:36:48  <mcstar> have*
2011-11-06T06:36:59  <mcstar> so on a lattice, they are the same
2011-11-06T06:37:26  <mcstar> but a* can be better an a lattice too, if you know your destination coordinates
2011-11-06T06:37:31  <marijnfs> yeah so, you still have to expand the node with the lowest tentative distance
2011-11-06T06:37:32  <mcstar> on*
2011-11-06T06:37:36  <marijnfs> according to the algorithm
2011-11-06T06:38:00  <mcstar> no, because i dont know any "tentative distance"

2011-11-06T06:38:36  <marijnfs> isnt there a case where you have to go around a corridor or something and this starts to matter
2011-11-06T06:38:42  <mcstar> i use this to search for a specific condition on the map, not for a specific location
2011-11-06T06:39:11  <mcstar> this cant be helped if i want to search for a condition
2011-11-06T06:39:21  <marijnfs> yeah you can create nice atrraction maps and stuff with it
2011-11-06T06:39:44  <mcstar> anyway, my point is in the implementation
2011-11-06T06:40:03  <mcstar> i guess that previously mentioned python code will be very slow compared to mine
2011-11-06T06:44:22  <marijnfs> you mean because of python?
2011-11-06T06:44:25  <marijnfs> or your early checknig

2011-11-06T06:47:07  <mcstar> well, python iterations are usually slow, that dict lookup is slower than popping a queue, and heap implementation isnt necessarily fast, for small sizes

2011-11-06T06:48:01  <mcstar> of course one has to profile it, or at least time it, but i thinkit will be slow compared to another implementation in python too
2011-11-06T06:48:37  <mcstar> i wonder how fast mine would be, in python, even if its bfs
2011-11-06T06:49:10  <marijnfs> you use c++?
2011-11-06T06:49:12  <RasmusL> it IS slow :)
2011-11-06T06:49:16  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-06T06:49:27  <RasmusL> im looking for ways to optimize it still
2011-11-06T06:49:31  <RasmusL> seems that i got it working at least
2011-11-06T06:49:42  <mcstar> what was wrong?
2011-11-06T06:50:32  <RasmusL> the hashing was the main thing
2011-11-06T06:50:52  <mcstar> did == fail?
2011-11-06T06:51:17  <RasmusL> yeah i couldn't just put my ANode class in the dict
2011-11-06T06:51:26  <RasmusL> but putting the position tuple worked
2011-11-06T06:51:43  <marijnfs> but its slow?

2011-11-06T06:53:12  <marijnfs> jeej c++
2011-11-06T06:53:16  <RasmusL> combination of python being slow and my method being slow i guess

2011-11-06T06:54:02  <RasmusL> hmm
2011-11-06T06:54:02  <RasmusL> yea
2011-11-06T06:54:22  <mcstar> i guess he means having a replica of the map
2011-11-06T06:54:50  <marijnfs> well an array of booleans the size of the map
2011-11-06T06:54:55  <RasmusL> you mean something like this?
2011-11-06T06:55:24  <mcstar> marijnfs: i guess you could store the g values on that map too
2011-11-06T06:55:25  <RasmusL> visited = [[0 for col in range(ants.cols)] for row in range(ants.rows)]
2011-11-06T06:55:45  <mcstar> im not sure, but are lists linked lists or vectors in python?
2011-11-06T06:55:51  <marijnfs> yeah or 'false'
2011-11-06T06:56:02  <marijnfs> vectors
2011-11-06T06:56:03  <RasmusL> vectors
2011-11-06T06:56:07  <marijnfs> but this is a vector of vectors
2011-11-06T06:56:26  <marijnfs> one big vector would be faster but hey
2011-11-06T06:56:51  <mcstar> im just asking cause a linked list would have bad characterisitcs here
2011-11-06T06:57:29  <mcstar> but consider numpy arrays

2011-11-06T06:57:43  <mcstar> since it is not run-time type checked

2011-11-06T06:58:22  <RasmusL> no need to do multi dimensional

2011-11-06T07:10:34  <mcstar> it shouldnt be slower than the dict for this

2011-11-06T07:16:22  <marijnfs> mcstar uses it apparently
2011-11-06T07:16:31  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-06T07:16:36  <pairofdice> is bot is c++?
2011-11-06T07:16:38  <marijnfs> ow no you have it
2011-11-06T07:16:39  <pairofdice> his*

2011-11-06T07:17:07  <RasmusL> gotta go for now, thanks for the help :)
2011-11-06T07:17:08  <mcstar> it doesnt matter if numpy is installed or not
2011-11-06T07:17:22  <mcstar> if it isnt, just ask amstan to install it
2011-11-06T07:17:27  <mcstar> or some other organizer

2011-11-06T07:29:28  <mcstar> my bot shows an emergent behavior when it attacks hills
2011-11-06T07:29:30  <smiley1983> zorun: sorry for the late reply - do you mean compiling to bytecode, or actually running through the toplevel interpreter? If bytecode then yes, on my system (linux) the starter package works correctly when compiled
2011-11-06T07:30:11  <mcstar> he wanted to run it in the interpreter
2011-11-06T07:30:20  <smiley1983> mcstar: what sort of emergent behavior?
2011-11-06T07:30:58  <mcstar> when the first ant closest to the enemy hive reaches it, all the other ants neaby start to form aline, and attack one after another
2011-11-06T07:31:17  <mcstar> after its destroyed, the split sideways
2011-11-06T07:31:22  <mcstar> they*

2011-11-06T07:41:01  <Belerafon> thanks
2011-11-06T07:41:16  <mcstar> it has a weird(interesting) behavior
2011-11-06T07:41:25  <conor_f> mcstar: mine?
2011-11-06T07:41:26  <mcstar> i always wonder how people do that
2011-11-06T07:41:28  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-06T07:41:32  <conor_f> all it does is gather food lol
2011-11-06T07:41:37  <mcstar> it moves smei-collectively
2011-11-06T07:41:42  <conor_f> using bfs to decide where to go to
2011-11-06T07:41:50  <mcstar> but all of them at once?
2011-11-06T07:42:08  <mcstar> you assign multiple ants to a food tile?
2011-11-06T07:42:11  <conor_f> the reason for the grouping is because I haven't made one ant go for one food, everyone goes to their closest one
2011-11-06T07:42:16  <jix> I guess it's a question of letting the ants search food or the food searching ants

2011-11-06T07:45:25  <conor_f> strange how it would work on some maps and not on all though
2011-11-06T07:46:06  <bobbydroptable> some maps are bigger and if you're doing bfs across a larger map it might be timing out?
2011-11-06T07:46:11  <mcstar> once mine crashed on some map, turned out, i handled wrapping badly, and on 1 particular map, the spawn point was at the very corner

2011-11-06T08:20:25  <thestinger> by "foraging" I mean going back and revisiting explored areas after not seeing them for a while

2011-11-06T09:20:27  <thestinger> yes (so is array.array from the python standard lib, but that's basically the same as a "list" in python, just of values instead of pointers)
2011-11-06T09:20:51  <thestinger> caution: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ really nice docs
2011-11-06T09:21:05  <conor_f> LOL

2011-11-06T09:21:22  <conor_f> I was using the wrong version of my bot lol
2011-11-06T09:21:28  <thestinger> in pure python, list comprehensions will also be faster than iterating with a for loop most of the time (but you can't really do stuff in-place)
2011-11-06T09:21:47  <thestinger> map(), filter() and reduce() could also be a performance improvement sometimes
2011-11-06T09:21:50  <conor_f> I'm _such_ a tool
2011-11-06T09:22:08  <Zao> Yes you are :D
2011-11-06T09:22:38  <thestinger> python doesn't give you a way to allocation a list faster than '[0] * 100'

2011-11-06T09:22:46  <thestinger> or a nice fast way to set them all to something

2011-11-06T09:23:24  <smiley1983> zorun: I can only imagine that it's doing something strange with stdin and stdout which prevent it from working, but if so it seems like a mistake
2011-11-06T09:23:33  <pairofdice> [0]*100 just gives you 100 references to the same list of [0] ;)

2011-11-06T09:37:02  <lericson> so guys, my approach is to calculate first where each ant wants to go and then to somehow adjust their "target" to the closest possible movement that won't go into walls, and won't go into other ants
2011-11-06T09:37:15  <lericson> what i'm wondering is how
2011-11-06T09:37:24  <lericson> a line sweep solver?
2011-11-06T09:38:16  <Minthos> a what?
2011-11-06T09:38:23  <Minthos> sounds like you want pathfinding
2011-11-06T09:38:31  <Minthos> use a BFS or A*
2011-11-06T09:40:25  <lericson> nah
2011-11-06T09:41:56  <bqf> lericson: nice idea... i might just rethink my initial "go with prolog to screw with everyone's brain" approach and use something like that
2011-11-06T09:43:29  <caution> I need to make my ants attack in formation

2011-11-06T09:46:42  <lericson> one of the toughest challenges, i find, with the ai challenge is that it is very hard to inject useful debugging info
2011-11-06T09:46:54  <lericson> like i would love to paint arrows and stuff on my ants, heatmap overlays and whanot
2011-11-06T09:47:21  <thestinger> you can

2011-11-06T09:47:43  <thestinger> check this out, someone made a really nice debugging thing for the visualizer
2011-11-06T09:48:35  <thestinger> you use 'v' (instead of 'o') to draw stuff basically
2011-11-06T09:48:59  <thestinger> I haven't actually ended up using it yet
2011-11-06T09:50:45  <lericson> please hold while judgement is being generated...
2011-11-06T09:51:33  <caution> can you check out the visualizer alone or do you have to build everything?
2011-11-06T09:51:45  <oprs> yeah, I was expecting something like that
2011-11-06T09:51:58  <oprs> I'm still using gnuplot at this time
2011-11-06T09:52:26  <oprs> nice
2011-11-06T09:52:40  <thestinger> caution: it's all python, there's nothing to build
2011-11-06T09:52:49  <caution> I thought it was java
2011-11-06T09:53:06  <thestinger> the visualizer is javascript/canvas
2011-11-06T09:53:21  <thestinger> I think the .jar is just a way to stream stuff live to it or something like that
2011-11-06T09:53:22  <caution> I thought the live visualiser is java

2011-11-06T09:55:15  <smiley1983> zorun: if I enter the commands into the ocaml toplevel to input_line from a fifo pipe (like in the example in my paste) then it can read from the pipe; the same functions seem to fail under ocamlrun, so I don't know what's going on, but thankfully the compiled versions all work as expected :)

2011-11-06T10:16:31  <pairofdice> Actually, some boolean algebra
2011-11-06T10:16:48  <a1k0n> ah
2011-11-06T10:16:57  <conor_f> pairofdice: really? where?
2011-11-06T10:17:18  <grwip> we're dealing with truth/false value but not really boolean algebra, for example there is no mention of the De Morgan rules
2011-11-06T10:17:29  <RasmusL> i'd do it, but i use enough time on this and it's not even relevant to my major :D
2011-11-06T10:17:30  <pairofdice> conor, in the truth tables :p
2011-11-06T10:17:43  <conor_f> lol, I dunno if that even counts :P

2011-11-06T10:18:05  <grwip> when I studied logic at uni it was forbidden to use truth tables
2011-11-06T10:18:09  <conor_f> btw, /join #ai-class
2011-11-06T10:18:15  <grwip> that was not accepted as a demonstration

2011-11-06T10:18:44  <grwip> that was nice, you had to go through more formal stuff, using axioms and Modus ponens

2011-11-06T11:05:33  <Antimony> I decided that my old pathfinding/goal selection was a flawed approach
2011-11-06T11:05:57  <jix> caution: until I was weak enough (because my ants were busy guarding the hill instead of exploring/gathering food) to be killed completly
2011-11-06T11:06:18  <conor_f> hmm
2011-11-06T11:06:29  <conor_f> I need to think about these ideas for a while, thanks guys
2011-11-06T11:06:30  <jix> so to make it effective you have to use a more offensive hill guarding strategy that doesn't stop you from expanding
2011-11-06T11:06:37  <a1k0n> yeah you need to balance conflicting priorities to get your ants to explore
2011-11-06T11:06:42  <a1k0n> the old explore/exploit tradeoff
2011-11-06T11:06:50  <Antimony> that was a major problem with my current bot

2011-11-06T11:11:30  <a1k0n> i dunno about that but maybe everything prior to games a couple days ago?  is it hard to re-run the trueskill stuff from scratch on a limited set?
2011-11-06T11:11:37  <a1k0n> or like
2011-11-06T11:11:50  <a1k0n> keep the games but only include fresh games in the trueskill run
2011-11-06T11:12:15  <Migi32> what's the problem?
2011-11-06T11:12:15  <a1k0n> i'm guessing you're not familiar enough with the server's implementation to do that off hand
2011-11-06T11:12:32  <a1k0n> check the 'last seen' for most of the bots on http://ants.fluxid.pl/ranking
2011-11-06T11:13:01  <a1k0n> new bots have a much larger sigma than the ones that are on there but not playing (and are basically disconnected from the graph of active users)

2011-11-06T11:13:30  <Migi32> this is why the Glicko rating system lets sigma increase over time
2011-11-06T11:13:43  <jix> a1k0n: wouldn't it be enough to just hide inactive bots from the rankings?
2011-11-06T11:13:57  <a1k0n> possibly, yes
2011-11-06T11:14:09  <a1k0n> but i'm still worried about what it does to trueskill
2011-11-06T11:14:23  <a1k0n> re: large uncertainty in rankings
2011-11-06T11:14:23  <jix> because trueskill is designed to give a reliable ranking inependent of what players there are (as far as that is possible)
2011-11-06T11:14:55  <jix> so if you recompute everything with some players removed... the skills of the remaining players should be close

2011-11-06T11:15:07  <jix> *to what
2011-11-06T11:15:14  <a1k0n> oh, yeah, agreed.  i thought you were suggesting removing them from the display only
2011-11-06T11:15:22  <jix> yeah I was
2011-11-06T11:15:28  <jix> because it should be almost the same
2011-11-06T11:15:35  <a1k0n> er, right.  i see.
2011-11-06T11:15:40  <jix> but just removing them from display is easier (probably)
2011-11-06T11:15:40  <a1k0n> maybe so.
2011-11-06T11:16:07  <Fluxid> a1k0n: i don't want to play with sqlite db to purge old data and keep db consistent
2011-11-06T11:16:18  <Fluxid> for me it's easier just to remove db file and restart
2011-11-06T11:16:22  <Migi32> or just sort on mu? The mu-3*sigma is just a lower bound, actually not something you should sort on anyway
2011-11-06T11:17:25  <Fluxid> the db is raw sqls, i'd need to understand what is going on in there, but i don't want to do this :)
2011-11-06T11:17:29  <jix> Fluxid: I think just hiding everyone who was inactive for <insert time span here> should work
2011-11-06T11:18:18  <Fluxid> jix: the thought of adding functionality to this code does not make me happy :)
2011-11-06T11:18:22  <a1k0n> it's actually sort of impressive how when you sort by mu it groups different versions of the same bot together
2011-11-06T11:19:13  <Migi32> a1k0n, that's mostly coincidence, I think
2011-11-06T11:19:48  <a1k0n> i think that means it's working.

2011-11-06T11:26:07  <a1k0n> but i would expect sigma to be more similar than what it is on fluxid's server
2011-11-06T11:26:18  <a1k0n> since a smaller population of bots played for a while and got a nice stable ranking, then stopped

2011-11-06T11:26:52  <amanforindia> in implementing pathfinding should i compute the next step every time or just execute from memory?
2011-11-06T11:28:44  <retybok_> amanforindia: I recompute everything at every turn, but if performance is an issue for you caching can certainly improve things.
2011-11-06T11:29:56  <amanforindia> ok...
2011-11-06T11:32:49  <Migi32> a1k0n, I don't know too much about trueskill, so I don't really know how much choosing mu-3*sigma over mu would affect the ratings if everyone played a similar amount of games, but still, the system was designed to have mu as the most accurate guess of someone's skill
2011-11-06T11:33:24  <a1k0n> agreed; perhaps that's how the final rankings should be decided
2011-11-06T11:34:02  <Migi32> what I'm trying to say is, imagine we were sorting on mu-10*sigma, then consistency in your results becomes very important

2011-11-06T11:39:34  <a1k0n> except you need a bidirectional redirect to the bot somehow

2011-11-06T11:39:51  <conor_f> socat :P

2011-11-06T11:42:08  <a1k0n> it looks like 1.3 is about as low as it gets
2011-11-06T11:42:13  <bqf> i wonder how trueskill would deal with a bot that randomly switches from its usual logic to leftybot in 50% of the games.
2011-11-06T11:42:14  <a1k0n> (on the contest site)
2011-11-06T11:42:43  <a1k0n> bqf: it'd fit a normal distribution to what is actually a bimodal distribution.. so it'd have a mu halfway between their strengths and a huge sigma
2011-11-06T11:43:12  <a1k0n> theory says that ought to work :)
2011-11-06T11:43:21  <Migi32> rewarding low sigma isn't bad, I think. Maybe 3*sigma is just too much

2011-11-06T11:45:13  <bqf> so all one has to do to get more games on the official servers is to have that switch logic in the bot for the first X games (by not switching anymore after some predefined date) then? ;)

2011-11-06T11:47:01  <Migi32> a1k0n, this can also be fixed by letting people start with low sigma
2011-11-06T11:47:25  <a1k0n> Migi32: that implies you have a good estimate of their skill, which you don't

2011-11-06T11:48:32  <a1k0n> stepForward: well it's either a bug or the fact that water squares persist after your ants leave the area (as there's no way for a water square to move or change once you've seen it)

2011-11-06T11:57:22  <Migi32> a1k0n, coming back to the mu-3*sigma thing, what do you think of proposing these 2 changes: 1. don't reset your rating when you reupload your code and 2. do the final ranking on mu instead of mu-3*sigma
2011-11-06T11:57:48  <retybok_> Is there a tcpserver with a lower thinking time? It would be nice to avoid waiting for the slow bots...
2011-11-06T11:58:36  <a1k0n> i agree with 2.  1 is tricky because your rating comes from your bot's games, and this is a new bot.  you could alter the prior for the skill distribution though, maybe like give it the same mu but set sigma to 3* the old sigma
2011-11-06T11:58:51  <a1k0n> i don't know if that can be gamed or not

2011-11-06T11:59:50  <bqf> retybok_: the turntime is that high on the tcp servers to avoid running into problems with network lag.
2011-11-06T12:02:06  <Migi32> a1k0n, if you see that you can just disqualify them. Rules say: "Entries which are deemed to violate the spirit of fair and sportsmanlike competition will be disqualified"
2011-11-06T12:02:23  <a1k0n> true.  it also doesn't help for the actual tournament.
2011-11-06T12:02:32  <Saulzar> Since you can't chose your pairings it makes it hard
2011-11-06T12:02:43  <conor_f> if I give a direction not in range (e.g, 5) will my bot stay where it is?
2011-11-06T12:02:48  <a1k0n> and it would take friggin' forever.  but you'd get more games by resubmitting often.
2011-11-06T12:03:10  <a1k0n> (but your sigma would just top out and you'd be in 5000th place so whatever)
2011-11-06T12:03:40  <Migi32> your place in the queue doesn't change when you resumbit
2011-11-06T12:03:51  <retybok_> bqf: in practice though when in games with fast bots we play several turns every second
2011-11-06T12:03:52  <a1k0n> i thought it gave you a priority boost for your first game
2011-11-06T12:04:09  <retybok_> it would be nice to have a fast server along with the slow one
2011-11-06T12:04:12  <Migi32> only for your very first game of your first sumbission
2011-11-06T12:04:14  <retybok_> for quick testing
2011-11-06T12:04:18  <a1k0n> oh really?  nice.
2011-11-06T12:05:52  <a1k0n> anyway, it sounds like a feasible solution in theory.  i'm pretty sure i remember janzert and McLeopold discussing this issue.  i don't know if the trueskill implementation being used is open to having per-user priors
2011-11-06T12:06:35  <a1k0n> but it would probably work IMHO
2011-11-06T12:07:14  <Migi32> what's a prior?
2011-11-06T12:07:43  <Migi32> I know you've said it like 3
2011-11-06T12:07:52  <Migi32> times already but I can't find it on google :P
2011-11-06T12:08:35  <a1k0n> so if you have to estimate my skill given 10 games, you can take some kind of average
2011-11-06T12:09:02  <a1k0n> the prior is what you get when you want to estimate the skill given 0 games.  you specify the distribution of likely skills given no other infomration.
2011-11-06T12:09:46  <a1k0n> in fact the problem with this approach is that it would limit the amount of skill you can gain per submission because a tighter prior would weakly pull your skill back to what it was last time, rather than pulling it much more weakly towards 50
2011-11-06T12:10:42  <a1k0n> and if you use mu=old mu, sigma=11 or whatever the default is, then you're basically getting a small free boost for no gain
2011-11-06T12:11:14  <stepForward> is there a way to know if an area has fog or not ?
2011-11-06T12:11:22  <ecarpenter84> the tutorial covers that
2011-11-06T12:11:24  <retybok_> I think prior is short for "prior information" or "prior knowledge"
2011-11-06T12:11:27  <a1k0n> anyway um, if you want to to look it up on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference
2011-11-06T12:11:27  <ecarpenter84> under exploring
2011-11-06T12:11:34  <a1k0n> retybok_: yes
2011-11-06T12:11:39  <a1k0n> prior distribution technically
2011-11-06T12:11:49  <a1k0n> trueskill assumes normal distributions over skills
2011-11-06T12:11:57  <a1k0n> and the prior is mu=50, sigma=a lot
2011-11-06T12:12:00  <retybok_> I was trying to be simple :)
2011-11-06T12:12:05  <Migi32> stepForward, you have to calculate that yourself. It's not in fog if it's further away than sqrt(77) from any of your ants
2011-11-06T12:12:12  <bqf> retybok_: true. you could talk to Fluxid about it, maybe he would be willing to lower the turntime a bit.
2011-11-06T12:12:21  <Migi32> stepForward, sorry, the other way round
2011-11-06T12:12:39  <retybok_> bqf: maybe I'll volunteer to run a "fast" server when my box is back up
2011-11-06T12:12:55  <retybok_> I understand the need for a slow server for people with bad connections
2011-11-06T12:12:56  <Migi32> a1k0n, but why does trueskill even have to know that you've resubmitted?
2011-11-06T12:13:10  <a1k0n> Migi32: because it would suck to have old versions of your bot drag you down
2011-11-06T12:13:11  *** master_ninja <master_ninja!~opera@62-44-227-19.bb.dnainternet.fi> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-06T12:13:12  <Migi32> I don't get this. If you use trueskill for humans, they also get better/worse after each game
2011-11-06T12:13:30  <retybok_> Migi32: because if you don't tell him, you're hiding information from it and violating its assumptions
2011-11-06T12:13:34  <a1k0n> but a bot isn't some kind of being learning to play the game
2011-11-06T12:13:38  <stepForward> Migi32: i think, i can set a value on square to define if the square has been viewed or not by one of my ants
2011-11-06T12:13:45  <a1k0n> eeach bot is a completely separate program
2011-11-06T12:13:47  <bqf> retybok_: even someone with a decent connection would run into trouble if the server is halfway around the globe.
2011-11-06T12:14:14  <retybok_> bqf: it's for people who don't care about ranking but just want quick test games
2011-11-06T12:14:25  <retybok_> I certainly don't care about my ranking on the test server
2011-11-06T12:14:27  <Migi32> a1k0n, why does that matter? For trueskill, each player is just a black box
2011-11-06T12:14:57  <retybok_> Migi32: nope, it's designed with real people in mind
2011-11-06T12:15:07  <stepForward> thx everyone
2011-11-06T12:15:17  <Migi32> also, it's not like it's a new bot written by a different person. It's probably fairly similar to the previous version
2011-11-06T12:15:31  <a1k0n> if you want to measure the performance of a given program, it makes no sense to include previous incarnations of the program in your estimation
2011-11-06T12:15:36  <Migi32> stepForward, yes, setting a flag for each square is what most bots do
2011-11-06T12:15:43  <ecarpenter84> stepForward: http://aichallenge.org/ants_tutorial_step_4.php
2011-11-06T12:15:49  <ecarpenter84> it covers keeping a list of unseen areas
2011-11-06T12:16:01  <a1k0n> yes it's probably similar so you can make some assumptions to speed up convergence but to do so introduces small biases
2011-11-06T12:16:08  <ecarpenter84> you can move that list into your do_turn and it will only keep track of what is unseen on that specific turn
2011-11-06T12:16:23  <stepForward> ecarpenter84: i usually avoid tutorials for game, i should probably go check it :P as long as it is a particular game
2011-11-06T12:16:41  <ecarpenter84> the sample bot isnt finished
2011-11-06T12:16:42  <a1k0n> upon further reflection i have to say i agree with the current situation, even though it really sucks to wait a week.  it'd be better just to have more servers
2011-11-06T12:16:50  <jix> btw does the server handle multiple connections under the same user? as in it doesn't try to pair me with myself?
2011-11-06T12:17:44  <retybok_> a1k0n: I guess the idea is to use the tcp server to develop your bot and only upload major improvements to the main server
2011-11-06T12:18:09  <thestinger> "A" completely destroys my bot :(

2011-11-06T12:22:41  <a1k0n> yup.  second time i've seen it happen
2011-11-06T12:23:02  <retybok_> is it a bug or is your bot simply lacking the feature?
2011-11-06T12:23:16  <a1k0n> no, it's a bug
2011-11-06T12:23:25  <a1k0n> it knows what's going to happen and it does it anyway
2011-11-06T12:23:33  <Migi32> I have issues too, a small bug I discovered that makes it "spastic" on some big maps: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=65756&user=7617
2011-11-06T12:24:05  <Migi32> it was a really small fix, and I want to upload it because it looks so embarrassing, but I can't because it resets rating :/
2011-11-06T12:24:37  <a1k0n> haha
2011-11-06T12:24:50  <retybok_> my bot doesn't know anything about other ants yet. I find that part the most challenging by far
2011-11-06T12:25:48  <Belerafon> Hi. What about attack radius? I get "attackradius2", calc float sqrt from it and calc float distances to enemy. And what? Simply compare it?
2011-11-06T12:26:22  <a1k0n> Belerafon: http://aichallenge.org/specification_battle.php
2011-11-06T12:26:37  <Migi32> Belaferon, you don't really need float. If you just test (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 <= attackradius2 you can work with only ints
2011-11-06T12:26:44  <conor_f> how can I make an ant stay where they are?
2011-11-06T12:26:52  <a1k0n> conor_f: don't move it?
2011-11-06T12:27:09  <Belerafon> thanks
2011-11-06T12:27:10  <a1k0n> easiest question all morning
2011-11-06T12:27:15  <pairofdice> :D
2011-11-06T12:27:17  <Antimony> lol
2011-11-06T12:27:27  <Antimony> just pretend each ant has 5 moves
2011-11-06T12:27:32  <Antimony> where the 5th is to not make a move
2011-11-06T12:27:44  <pairofdice> n,e,s,w,gtfo!
2011-11-06T12:27:47  <conor_f> I mean what do I give to getLocaion/makeNextMove to make it stay still?
2011-11-06T12:27:52  <Antimony> nothing
2011-11-06T12:27:54  <Antimony> don't call it
2011-11-06T12:28:09  <Antimony> you could pass it an invalid value but that's kind of bad design
2011-11-06T12:28:30  <thestinger> I keep a set of lazy_ants which I need to prevent collisions :P
2011-11-06T12:28:37  <conor_f> ty Antimony
2011-11-06T12:28:45  <Antimony> collision prevention is the one thing my bot does well
2011-11-06T12:28:58  <Antimony> it can manage 5x5 squares without any collision
2011-11-06T12:29:16  <jix> I prevent collision by not allowing an ant to move where another ant moved already... unless... there is no other move... which sucks as collision prvention
2011-11-06T12:29:21  <Migi32> however, it's almost never useful to make an ant stay still, right? Always keep them moving
2011-11-06T12:29:31  <conor_f> jix: same :P
2011-11-06T12:29:33  <Antimony> no it's often useful
2011-11-06T12:29:37  <conor_f> Migi32: defense

2011-11-06T12:29:46  <thestinger> I never have collisions because my step() function won't allow a move to a tile with an ant that doesn't have an order

2011-11-06T12:50:15  <Minthos> it should just be an allocation and some initialization code, not expensive unless the init code calls something heavy
2011-11-06T12:51:11  <hacklash> I'm having a problem with my bot timing out
2011-11-06T12:51:40  <praveen_> Got to do an assignment now. But my mind is thinking about this only, in fact I am not doing either :) and just watching this.
2011-11-06T12:51:49  <hacklash> it's in Java and I think that the problem is Garbage Collection takes longer than my turn
2011-11-06T12:52:00  <Minthos> hacklash: you can check how much time remains of each turn with the starting kit
2011-11-06T12:52:21  <hacklash> I'm using that to track how long I have left
2011-11-06T12:52:30  <conor_f> fine, I'll just ramble along in here...
2011-11-06T12:52:41  <Minthos> gc shouldn't take long unless you have huge amounts of objects in a big graph
2011-11-06T12:52:49  <hacklash> and a subroutine that usually takes 2 ms never completes and I time out with ~700ms left
2011-11-06T12:53:09  <conor_f> I need to keep track of individual ants as I've stored vars for them in a class instance for them
2011-11-06T12:53:19  <Minthos> sounds like a bug, infinite loop probably
2011-11-06T12:53:30  <yoden> i'm not sure the server is giving java bots the correct heap size
2011-11-06T12:53:30  <hacklash> i guess its possible
2011-11-06T12:53:46  <yoden> i've been having the same gc issues; runs fine locally with -Xmx900m
2011-11-06T12:53:49  <yoden> times out on server
2011-11-06T12:53:59  <conor_f> but the way that ants are "kept track" of by the game state is just if theres an ant there, add 1 to the number of ants you have
2011-11-06T12:54:02  <Minthos> does your bot use that much memory?
2011-11-06T12:54:06  <conor_f> which isn't good enough for me.
2011-11-06T12:54:22  <hacklash> me or yoden? i don't know
2011-11-06T12:54:36  <conor_f> I need to find a way to keep using the original instances of the ants
2011-11-06T12:54:40  <conor_f> any ideas?
2011-11-06T12:54:43  <Minthos> hacklash: both :p
2011-11-06T12:55:02  <Minthos> conor_f: keep track of their locations
2011-11-06T12:55:04  <yoden> meh, the java gc is fast
2011-11-06T12:55:09  <yoden> use all the memory you can xD
2011-11-06T12:55:10  <hacklash> not sure how to profile how much memory is being used. Is there an easy way?
2011-11-06T12:55:17  <Minthos> conor_f: compare with their new locations when the turn begins
2011-11-06T12:55:19  <yoden> hacklash: use visualvm
2011-11-06T12:55:23  <ikaros> remember where you move the ants and compare those locations with the new ones from the next turn
2011-11-06T12:55:25  <hacklash> ok
2011-11-06T12:55:34  <ISpecies> conor_f: have a grid of pointers to your instances and move the pointers everytime you move your ants
2011-11-06T12:55:35  <conor_f> Minthos: that's awkward and ugly though...
2011-11-06T12:55:44  <ISpecies> basically what ikaros said
2011-11-06T12:55:50  <Minthos> conor_f: it's pretty much the only way to do it
2011-11-06T12:56:02  <conor_f> and how do I loop through each ant to get it's next move?
2011-11-06T12:56:30  <Minthos> I store the moves separately when I issue an order
2011-11-06T12:56:35  <ikaros> just when you call your move function.. and its successful add the new location to a hash or sth
2011-11-06T12:56:36  <Minthos> so I know where each ant plans to go
2011-11-06T12:57:40  <conor_f> bleh, there must be a better way to do it...
2011-11-06T12:58:20  <conor_f> where does it get decided that one of my ants eat some food and that I get a new ant?
2011-11-06T12:59:33  <Minthos> in the server
2011-11-06T12:59:47  <conor_f> :/ no good so
2011-11-06T13:00:36  <Antimony> ug I keep getting a compile error for some random system header

2011-11-06T13:07:34  <Antimony> well for one thing, the timer causes windows headers to be included everywhere
2011-11-06T13:07:42  <Antimony> which defines rad1 as a macro
2011-11-06T13:07:45  <antimatroid> yeah the timer was a pita
2011-11-06T13:07:53  <Antimony> just use pimpl
2011-11-06T13:08:10  <Antimony> also, why use clock() and not QueryPerformanceCounter?
2011-11-06T13:08:18  <conor_f> why wouldn't you just have an ant class and say if it's dead or alive, instead you just count how many ants you have with no idea of who they were before :P
2011-11-06T13:08:28  <a1k0n> because QueryPerformanceCounter is a windows-specific function?
2011-11-06T13:08:32  <Antimony> you shouldn't care about dead ants
2011-11-06T13:08:33  <antimatroid> Antimony: i don't know much about timers :P
2011-11-06T13:08:35  <thestinger> gettimeofday() is actually deprecated in POSIX:2008
2011-11-06T13:08:40  <thestinger> I was surprised
2011-11-06T13:08:49  <thestinger> they have nicer clock_ functions now though
2011-11-06T13:08:55  <Antimony> alk0n, I'm referring to the windows timer
2011-11-06T13:09:06  <Antimony> the mac/linux uses something different
2011-11-06T13:09:11  <conor_f> Antimony: I actually care about tracking my ants though, so I can say where they've been, what sort they are, etc
2011-11-06T13:09:36  <Antimony> I track ants too, but I don't keep track of dead ones
2011-11-06T13:09:44  <conor_f> how do you do it so?
2011-11-06T13:10:00  <conor_f> keep track of their previous locaion + dest location + current location?
2011-11-06T13:10:13  <Antimony> each ant has a pos and a next
2011-11-06T13:10:17  <Antimony> at the start of the turn

2011-11-06T13:14:32  <Migi32> a1k0n, I thought some more about the issue with priors and how you could be at a disadvantage, and I think I understand it now. I agree that setting the prior to your current mu/sigma would be bad. But what I'm proposing is to keep the prior at mu=50, s=16.67 and let the current rating stay the same (or in other word: doing nothing at all)
2011-11-06T13:15:30  <Migi32> makes sense?

2011-11-06T13:42:58  <conor_f> guys, I've forgotten how to pass variables to a constructer when it's in a vector.push_back() again >_<
2011-11-06T13:43:11  <amstan_> so when did the DST happen?
2011-11-06T13:43:19  <a1k0n> 2am local time
2011-11-06T13:43:24  <amstan_> today?
2011-11-06T13:43:29  <a1k0n> this AM
2011-11-06T13:43:33  <a1k0n> slash last night, whatever
2011-11-06T13:43:54  <conor_f> did DST not happen ~a week ago?
2011-11-06T13:43:56  <amstan_> yeah.. all my clocks are in sync, so i have no idea, lol
2011-11-06T13:44:08  <conor_f> :P
2011-11-06T13:44:12  <amstan_> microwave time might be changed though
2011-11-06T13:44:15  <a1k0n> in the US it got pushed back to the first week in November a couple years ago
2011-11-06T13:44:22  <conor_f> sorry, .us is different
2011-11-06T13:44:48  <mleise> i have an analog radio controlled clock. it wakes me up when the change happens ssssrrrrrrrr.....
2011-11-06T13:45:12  <conor_f> so I'm not going to get any sympathy again for messing up? :P
2011-11-06T13:45:12  <a1k0n> heh i have one of those too
2011-11-06T13:45:29  <mcstar> it happened from saturday's night to sunday's morning
2011-11-06T13:46:04  <mcstar> conor_f: what do you mean?
2011-11-06T13:46:22  <mcstar> how about simply passing it?
2011-11-06T13:46:32  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-06T13:46:49  <conor_f> but what happens is it gets passed to the vector constructer instead of the class constructer

2011-11-06T13:47:44  <a1k0n> what?  if you vector.push_back(Foo(x,y,z)) it constructs a Foo and then Foo's copy constructor copies the temporary into the vector
2011-11-06T13:48:01  <a1k0n> and hopefully that all gets inlined and optimized away
2011-11-06T13:48:22  <mcstar> dont you think the move constructor is being called?
2011-11-06T13:48:40  <a1k0n> whatever you want to call the Foo(const Foo &) constructor
2011-11-06T13:48:49  <mcstar> at least in c++11
2011-11-06T13:49:07  <a1k0n> C++11 defines a move constructor separate from the copy constructor and operator=?

2011-11-06T14:30:59  <mcstar> yes, definitely
2011-11-06T14:31:29  <bqf> Printz: it depends on what languages you already know. if you're just starting out, python is probably a good idea - it tends to look a lot like pseudo-code ;)
2011-11-06T14:31:49  <mcstar> true dat
2011-11-06T14:31:53  <Rinum> Printz: Python
2011-11-06T14:32:03  <mcstar> and you dont have to think in terms of "classes"
2011-11-06T14:32:37  <mcstar> but if i were you, i would probably learn java cause its faster
2011-11-06T14:33:30  <Printz> Hmm... Sounds reasonable,
2011-11-06T14:33:31  <avdg> meh, a fast language only compensate performance, if you can deal with the performance part, its no problem for using a high level language
2011-11-06T14:35:05  <avdg> fast languages can actually be slower, dependent on the implementation
2011-11-06T14:35:12  <mcstar> i would say get confortable with java, than learn clojure
2011-11-06T14:35:37  <mcstar> maybe the other way around is better

2011-11-06T14:36:41  <mcstar> i know you all gonna hate me, but i consider python a scripting language, i.e. for writing disposable scripts
2011-11-06T14:36:43  <avdg> well, its still the developer who has to make the choice ;-)
2011-11-06T14:37:00  <avdg> nothing wrong with that part
2011-11-06T14:37:15  <Antimony> if you want speed, use C++, not JAva
2011-11-06T14:37:17  <thestinger> mcstar: clojure is dynamically typed too
2011-11-06T14:37:27  <Antimony> if you want something that's easy to learn and code in, use Python
2011-11-06T14:37:38  <Antimony> if you hate yourself, use Java
2011-11-06T14:37:53  <mcstar> thestinger: after you get comfortable in java, you can write performance critical parts in java, and call them from clojure
2011-11-06T14:38:04  <mcstar> i think its a very nice symbiosis in principle
2011-11-06T14:38:11  <yoden> maybe we shouldn't allow people to answer "what language should i use" questions
2011-11-06T14:38:12  <yoden> lol
2011-11-06T14:38:21  <avdg> maybe :-)
2011-11-06T14:38:31  <yoden> just becomes a baseless flamewar every time
2011-11-06T14:38:34  <thestinger> mcstar: that's the same idea with C extensions and CPython - and it sucks
2011-11-06T14:38:42  <thestinger> mcstar: scala is competitive in speed with java - why not use that? :P
2011-11-06T14:38:58  <mcstar> thestinger: because its not a lisp
2011-11-06T14:39:01  <avdg> the path of the least resistance is mostly the best one :-)
2011-11-06T14:39:05  <jix> thestinger: if you're used to do a lot of metaprogramming....
2011-11-06T14:39:43  <avdg> (unless you hit things you can't do with that path)
2011-11-06T14:39:43  <mcstar> thestinger: you can give type hints in clojure, although ive neve tried it
2011-11-06T14:39:46  <RasmusL> i just started using Python because of aichallenge
2011-11-06T14:39:47  <RasmusL> not sure if i like it :)
2011-11-06T14:39:56  <Antimony> Python is awesomex
2011-11-06T14:40:04  <mcstar> thestinger: as clojure gets better, java will jit optimize more and more things too

2011-11-06T14:40:09  <avdg> I wonder which language is actually performing the worst
2011-11-06T14:40:21  <mleise> define "performing"
2011-11-06T14:40:22  <Antimony> python is the easiest language to use that I know of
2011-11-06T14:40:32  <mleise> slow, unhandy, crashes?
2011-11-06T14:40:33  <avdg> lets say iterations
2011-11-06T14:40:40  <RasmusL> tbh it's not much easier than c++
2011-11-06T14:40:49  <mcstar> what is the saddest language?
2011-11-06T14:40:50  <jix> avdg: c64 basic?
2011-11-06T14:40:55  <jix> that is pretty slow

2011-11-06T14:41:33  <mleise> sure
2011-11-06T14:41:35  <thestinger> well, you know C++ - you can't compare the ease of a language you know to one you'

2011-11-06T14:41:39  <thestinger> you're learning*
2011-11-06T14:41:40  <Antimony> all you really need to know are map and list comphrehensions
2011-11-06T14:41:52  <Antimony> I know C++ and I still think Python is easier
2011-11-06T14:41:59  <Antimony> I've been doing C++ for years

2011-11-06T14:42:40  <Antimony> yes
2011-11-06T14:42:49  <RasmusL> uglyyy
2011-11-06T14:43:03  <mleise> RasmusL: not ugly, good style
2011-11-06T14:43:12  <Antimony> well that's the tradeoff of allowing variable declarations
2011-11-06T14:43:21  <Antimony> you have to have a way to distinguish scope
2011-11-06T14:43:34  <Antimony> so x creates a global and self.x creates a member
2011-11-06T14:43:50  <mleise> that's the same in JavaScript

2011-11-06T14:46:45  <thestinger> Antimony: well, that's due to dynamic typing - there are compiled languages that can have runtime type errors
2011-11-06T14:47:18  <thestinger> Go, C++, etc.
2011-11-06T14:47:18  <Antimony> but if you mistype a variable name for instance
2011-11-06T14:47:34  <Antimony> you won't get an error until the function is actually run in python

2011-11-06T14:48:02  <RasmusL> at least the errors are usually very helpful

2011-11-06T14:48:07  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-06T14:48:13  <Antimony> a name, stacktrace everything
2011-11-06T14:48:18  <Antimony> so much nicer than debugging C++

2011-11-06T14:50:01  <mleise> foRei: Yes, in the competition there are more than twice as many people using Java, just look at the rankings
2011-11-06T14:50:12  <RasmusL> and if any exception happens you will timeout

2011-11-06T14:50:52  <foRei> Oh, I ment on a general "weapon of choice" world wide :D
2011-11-06T14:51:08  <Antimony> that's because every CS class teaches Javax
2011-11-06T14:51:12  <Antimony> *Java
2011-11-06T14:51:36  <RasmusL> C++ is the weapon of choice worldwide :P
2011-11-06T14:51:41  <foRei> Is there a reason why they choose java over other languages for CS classes?
2011-11-06T14:51:56  <RasmusL> im totally unbiased i promise
2011-11-06T14:51:58  <Printz> hmm... It doesn't seem so
2011-11-06T14:52:10  <RasmusL> that's weird.

2011-11-06T14:54:10  <RasmusL> i'm not, haha
2011-11-06T14:54:21  <mleise> When C# was created it was a cross-platform language, but being written by Microsoft there was only a Windows implementation.
2011-11-06T14:54:35  <a1k0n> do you get accused of that often? :)
2011-11-06T14:54:42  <mleise> So Java is still considered more "open" I guess
2011-11-06T14:55:21  <RasmusL> oh not too often, I'm not in many places with programmers so few people know him I guess

2011-11-06T15:07:22  <conor_f> yeah :P
2011-11-06T15:07:32  <a1k0n> just replan each frame.  anything else is premature optimization
2011-11-06T15:07:39  <mcstar> soo, here comes my joke, you seem to break the compilers, man
2011-11-06T15:07:39  <mleise> mcstar: I have a several pages document on how it is supposed to work, but the dynamic update implementation and algorithms to support it are taking all the fun out of it

2011-11-06T15:08:16  <mleise> copy ctor anyone?
2011-11-06T15:08:18  <RasmusL> a1k0n: but running A* search for each ant each turn is really heavy
2011-11-06T15:08:23  <conor_f> hmm, weird
2011-11-06T15:08:25  <RasmusL> or my A* algorithm is bad :)
2011-11-06T15:08:29  <a1k0n> true.  i don't use A* at all.
2011-11-06T15:08:39  <mcstar> RasmusL: it should take less time than mine
2011-11-06T15:08:46  <mleise> RasmusL: You should ideally be between 0.3-0.5 seconds with A*
2011-11-06T15:08:51  <mcstar> a path in 0.1 ms is not heavy
2011-11-06T15:08:52  <mleise> sorry, ms per path
2011-11-06T15:09:03  <conor_f> because I put a debug print in the constructer and it never gets hit
2011-11-06T15:09:04  <Rinum> if you use A*, only use it for food
2011-11-06T15:09:09  <RasmusL> it's probably around 1s for 25 ants

2011-11-06T15:10:31  <mcstar> conor_f: if you want i can take a look at a complete code sample
2011-11-06T15:10:32  <mleise> DON'T say you use an array
2011-11-06T15:10:34  <RasmusL> Python 3.2, heapq
2011-11-06T15:10:39  <mleise> ok ;)
2011-11-06T15:10:50  <conor_f> mcstar: you won't like what you'd see
2011-11-06T15:10:51  <RasmusL> :P
2011-11-06T15:11:08  <yoden> you can do a couple thousand a* paths per turn pretty easily
2011-11-06T15:11:10  <mleise> still seems slow though. maybe you don't go low-level enough
2011-11-06T15:11:12  <yoden> no reason to store IMO
2011-11-06T15:11:27  <RasmusL> i also use a dictionary for visited nodes
2011-11-06T15:11:36  <RasmusL> no wait, i switched to a set
2011-11-06T15:11:41  <RasmusL> seems faster than anything else
2011-11-06T15:11:43  <mleise> yoden: a couple maybe: 2000, but not much more
2011-11-06T15:12:07  <RasmusL> numpy array is much slower than the set
2011-11-06T15:12:16  <yoden> i'm pretty sure I can do way more than 2000 in 1 second
2011-11-06T15:12:24  <yoden> a* is only taking about 20ms atm
2011-11-06T15:12:30  <mleise> yoden: you only get 500ms!
2011-11-06T15:12:37  <yoden> oh, i thought it was 1s
2011-11-06T15:12:39  <yoden> still :>
2011-11-06T15:12:41  <RasmusL> i can't do 100 in a second! :D

2011-11-06T15:12:55  <mcstar> thats what i was saying
2011-11-06T15:13:01  <mcstar> and its not even a*
2011-11-06T15:13:05  <mleise> RasmusL: A set is no priority queue
2011-11-06T15:13:14  <RasmusL> no the set is for the visited nodes
2011-11-06T15:13:17  <mleise> ok
2011-11-06T15:13:22  <Rinum> yoden: I would love to see your A* implementation =P

2011-11-06T15:13:51  <mcstar> mleise: pathfinding is fast, however i could only do a 2-turn game tree for small situations in reasonable time
2011-11-06T15:14:02  <mleise> make use of the constant cost of 1 for every edge in the graph ;)
2011-11-06T15:14:12  <mcstar> meaning, for 100 ants i will not be able to do better

2011-11-06T15:16:17  <RasmusL> oh it's calculated in the getChildNodes function
2011-11-06T15:16:24  <RasmusL> it returns a tuple of ANodes :)
2011-11-06T15:16:38  <mleise> I see, I don't speak Python
2011-11-06T15:16:59  <RasmusL> i'm sure it's a bit obscure when I leave out most of the functions anyway

2011-11-06T15:21:32  <RasmusL> i just get the path by reversing from the dest node up the parents
2011-11-06T15:21:44  <RasmusL> until im back at the start
2011-11-06T15:21:47  <RasmusL> :D
2011-11-06T15:23:07  <mleise> RasmusL: A closed list is where nodes go that you already expanded and checked so they don't end up being checked again.
2011-11-06T15:23:13  <Antimony> wtf
2011-11-06T15:23:21  <Antimony> my bot is sending every move order twice
2011-11-06T15:23:23  <RasmusL> ah
2011-11-06T15:23:23  <Rinum> excellent! My c++ bot can now control 100s of ants! (compared to a mere ~40 with Python with the same algorithms)
2011-11-06T15:23:44  <mleise> RasmusL: It will save you some time. I just store that info as a bool flag in my nodes.
2011-11-06T15:23:46  <RasmusL> well, i just add every single node i've been to, to the visited list
2011-11-06T15:23:55  <Rinum> ! 200 ants moved in only 30ms!
2011-11-06T15:23:57  <RasmusL> or the visited set, rather
2011-11-06T15:24:00  <mleise> RasmusL: that is a different list
2011-11-06T15:24:11  <Rinum> which includes file IO
2011-11-06T15:24:14  <mleise> You want to check the visited nodes again

2011-11-06T15:24:26  <RasmusL> i do? D:
2011-11-06T15:24:31  <RasmusL> i don't
2011-11-06T15:24:42  <Rinum> thanks! I'm so glad I made the switch to C++
2011-11-06T15:24:47  <mleise> ok then we have different visited lists ^^
2011-11-06T15:25:02  <mleise> hmm what else could make it slow...
2011-11-06T15:25:16  <RasmusL> oh mine is quite simple :D once i've added the 4 child nodes to the heap
2011-11-06T15:25:18  <RasmusL> it's flagged as visited
2011-11-06T15:25:21  <RasmusL> and never gets visited again
2011-11-06T15:25:43  <mleise> ok, that's the closed list then
2011-11-06T15:26:01  <RasmusL> i see
2011-11-06T15:26:08  <RasmusL> can i use that to generate the path?
2011-11-06T15:26:14  <yoden> it should be illegal to implement algorithms with a different terminology than the wikipedia reference implementation
2011-11-06T15:26:15  <yoden> xD
2011-11-06T15:26:16  <mleise> what value does the first node have you put in the heap?
2011-11-06T15:26:32  <RasmusL> it's the ant's start location
2011-11-06T15:26:43  <mleise> RasmusL: the closed list doesn't contain the path unfortunately.
2011-11-06T15:26:51  <Antimony> oops
2011-11-06T15:27:00  <Antimony> I was acicdently calling the makeMoves function twice
2011-11-06T15:27:01  <RasmusL> yeah as far as i understood from reading
2011-11-06T15:27:09  <mleise> RasmusL: and what is its 'value' in the priority queue? zero or the actual distance?
2011-11-06T15:27:15  <RasmusL> all I could do was start at the destination node and run backwards through the parents
2011-11-06T15:27:24  <Antimony> thats how you're supposed to do it
2011-11-06T15:27:30  <RasmusL> it's value is G+H
2011-11-06T15:27:31  <Antimony> each visited node stores its parent
2011-11-06T15:27:40  <Antimony> then backtrack to get the path once your done

2011-11-06T15:30:05  <mleise> never :)
2011-11-06T15:30:08  <mleise> what is it?
2011-11-06T15:30:20  <Strepto> anyone know where I can see the debug messages produced by greedyBot in the python starter package?
2011-11-06T15:30:25  <mleise> it should almost always be rows + cols
2011-11-06T15:30:25  <RasmusL> distance in rows + distance in cols from destination
2011-11-06T15:30:50  <mleise> RasmusL: that's fine ... never overestimate the distance if you want an optimal path
2011-11-06T15:31:21  <RasmusL> and the G is of course parent's G + 1

2011-11-06T15:32:39  <mleise> You did everything right I guess. You could probably exchange the visited set with a boolean flag, but I don't think it will make it faster by orders of magnitude
2011-11-06T15:33:21  <RasmusL> seems that checking if a value is in a set is O(1)
2011-11-06T15:33:24  <RasmusL> so it doesn't get much better
2011-11-06T15:33:39  <mleise> O(log n) I would guess
2011-11-06T15:33:55  <thestinger> O(1) for python sets, they are unordered
2011-11-06T15:33:58  <mleise> is it a hash set?
2011-11-06T15:34:04  <thestinger> yes
2011-11-06T15:34:11  <thestinger> dict/set in python are unordered
2011-11-06T15:34:18  <thestinger> there's an ordered dict in the standard lib
2011-11-06T15:34:24  <mleise> ok, still it is slower in constant time than a boolean flag ;)
2011-11-06T15:34:29  <yoden> yeah
2011-11-06T15:34:36  <yoden> set is a bad way to store the visited nodes
2011-11-06T15:34:53  <mleise> it also has to allocate memory etc. etc.
2011-11-06T15:35:15  <mleise> Does anyone else use Python and can give performance hints?
2011-11-06T15:35:26  <RasmusL> i can't just put a boolean flag in the ANode class :/
2011-11-06T15:35:30  <cyphase> mleise, take a look at cython
2011-11-06T15:35:34  <mleise> I can't belive that it shouldn't be possible to compute the paths for 100 ants
2011-11-06T15:35:45  <thestinger> it is definitely possible
2011-11-06T15:35:55  <RasmusL> i'm sure it is, just gotta figure it out :D
2011-11-06T15:36:04  <mleise> cyphase: I'm not using Python. I was asking for RasmusL :)
2011-11-06T15:36:23  <mleise> I just generally like optimizing stuff

2011-11-06T15:37:21  <cyphase> RasmusL, you can use cython to compile a .so module, then use that from your python script

2011-11-06T15:37:27  <RasmusL> i see
2011-11-06T15:37:57  <thestinger> RasmusL: how do you store the graph?
2011-11-06T15:38:12  <thestinger> you should use a 2d list/array.array or a numpy array
2011-11-06T15:38:25  <mleise> thestinger: look here: http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#breaking-ties

2011-11-06T15:39:10  <thestinger> ah, you can just store it as a preallocated 2d array though
2011-11-06T15:39:34  <RasmusL> i thought the heap helped by popping the smallest F values tho?

2011-11-06T15:39:53  <RasmusL> yup
2011-11-06T15:40:31  <thestinger> well, don't use plain old A* to send multiple ants to 1 target - use it sparingly when you need to move 1 ant somewhere

2011-11-06T15:41:07  <thestinger> you can just do a BFS from a target and save all the distances, then use that to pathfind for any number of ants

2011-11-06T17:27:08  <ejls> mcstar: It can't work pointer based : int *a=new int(42), *b=new int(42); conceptually, a is equal to b.
2011-11-06T17:27:54  <mcstar> well, if every number has the same address...
2011-11-06T17:28:00  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-06T17:28:28  <thestinger> 'row * ROWS + col' is what I was using to get a unique int somewhere for coords
2011-11-06T17:28:34  <mcstar> ejls: so,about what i wrote a moment ago?
2011-11-06T17:28:35  <ejls> Yeah... but Coord is my class for position, with the cantor pairing function if my unordered_map is big enough I'm sure there ll be no collision.
2011-11-06T17:29:09  <thestinger> I mean 'row * COLS + col'
2011-11-06T17:29:23  <thestinger> or something like that... I'm confused now :)
2011-11-06T17:29:31  <mcstar> second is ok

2011-11-06T17:30:01  <mcstar> i mean, for hashing you only need to establish equivalence, dont you?
2011-11-06T17:30:23  <ejls> Yes but this formula is dependant on another variable. It's ok in this case but I don't like it. :p
2011-11-06T17:31:13  <mcstar> ejls: so if i define that in std i dont have to provide it?
2011-11-06T17:31:21  <ejls> It's not a good idea, if I decide to hash tile after the end of the row (for an iterator for exemple) it'll not work.
2011-11-06T17:31:25  <mcstar> its like adding one more type for the basci types
2011-11-06T17:31:57  <ejls> mcstar: yes.
2011-11-06T17:33:17  <mcstar> thx
2011-11-06T17:34:40  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-06T17:34:42  <mcstar> well
2011-11-06T17:35:16  <mcstar> in common lisp, that pointer exmaple is not a problem, cause simple numbers are hashed by value
2011-11-06T17:35:40  <mcstar> and under the hood, compund objects are hashed by their memory location i think
2011-11-06T17:36:12  <mcstar> i never gave it thought before, you just use it :)
2011-11-06T17:36:33  <ejls> Btw, the cantor pairing function (the one in my code) is good for numbers in N only, it'll work for negative numbers but may be less efficient.
2011-11-06T17:36:44  <mcstar> but there you can provide a function, by which to compare objects

2011-11-06T17:38:04  <ejls> C++ is designed to be efficient, in the case of pair hashing, the best is to let the user define the hashing function.

2011-11-06T18:57:36  <Antimony> but the ai needs to be able to coordinate 3 or 4 ants in formation to do it
2011-11-06T18:57:43  <nickjohnson> I should say, writing a general AI that can identify the need and then attack in formation would be just about impossible
2011-11-06T18:58:23  <mcstar> Antimony: i think timing out is generally not a good strategy :D

2011-11-06T20:04:45  <Antimony> that doesn't work at higher levels
2011-11-06T20:04:53  <Antimony> because you can't collect enough food to maintain production

2011-11-06T20:14:46  <bmh> Antimony: make sure you have a hull around your hill and defend the surface of the hull
2011-11-06T20:14:52  <bmh> everyone within the hull can forage

2011-11-06T20:15:48  <Antimony> the problem with taht
2011-11-06T20:15:58  <Antimony> is that you're not gaurentted to have nats near your hill
2011-11-06T20:16:04  <Antimony> so pulling back won't help
2011-11-06T20:16:18  <bmh> don't forget that getting food = getting ants near your hill
2011-11-06T20:16:38  <foRei> yep :)
2011-11-06T20:16:52  <Antimony> but unless you've got constant production going, they'll often leave soon afterwards

2011-11-06T20:22:16  <Antimony> I've never had a problem with speed
2011-11-06T20:22:19  <roflmao> but bfs is better for general pathfinding

2011-11-06T20:22:52  <VoidXC> ok, well that should make it simpler, I've never used A* before lol
2011-11-06T20:23:05  <bmh> VoidXC: do you know Dijkstra's algorithm?
2011-11-06T20:23:06  <Antimony> A* is only useful for a single target earch
2011-11-06T20:23:08  <roflmao> a star is just bfs with 3 different properties
2011-11-06T20:23:12  <roflmao> 1. sorting
2011-11-06T20:23:15  <roflmao> 2. sorting by heuristic

2011-11-06T20:23:44  <bmh> roflmao: 3 is incorrect :)
2011-11-06T20:23:49  <bergmark> roflmao: I thought A* was more like DFS than BFS?
2011-11-06T20:23:59  <roflmao> yea it is
2011-11-06T20:24:02  <VoidXC> Yeah I'm familiar with dijkstra's algorithm, needed to use it in a class I had
2011-11-06T20:24:17  <roflmao> you sort by lowest heurisitic
2011-11-06T20:24:23  <roflmao> pick nodes with lowest estimated cost
2011-11-06T20:24:27  <roflmao> so you end up visiting way less nodes
2011-11-06T20:24:30  <roflmao> than in a standard dfs or bfs

2011-11-06T20:24:37  <bmh> VoidXC: ok, great -- A* is the same thing as Dijkstra's. The only difference is you add a number to each value as you insert it into the priority queue.
2011-11-06T20:25:09  <bmh> VoidXC: In Dijkstra's, as you enqueue things, you insert them with a score g(x) where g is the distance travelled to that point
2011-11-06T20:25:47  <bmh> let's make this notationally better -- you have a source s and a target t -- g(s,x) is the cost to get from s to x
2011-11-06T20:25:48  <VoidXC> right
2011-11-06T20:26:04  <bmh> in A* you enqueue with the value g(s,x) + h(x,t) where h is a function that estimates the distance
2011-11-06T20:26:32  <bmh> the only constraint on h(x,t) is that it cannot overestimate the distance
2011-11-06T20:26:47  <bmh> Dijkstra's algorithm is just A* with h(x,t) = 0 -- and with that, I'm going to seat some soup.
2011-11-06T20:26:52  <roflmao> yea
2011-11-06T20:26:52  <bmh> %s/seat/eat/
2011-11-06T20:26:59  <roflmao> in fact underestimating the distance is frequently used
2011-11-06T20:27:10  <roflmao> you sacrifice the most optimal path but reduce the number of visited nodes by a huge margin

2011-11-06T20:27:31  <VoidXC> ohhh ok, so I could just use the distance(loc1, loc2) method in the starter pack as the h function
2011-11-06T20:27:37  <roflmao> yep
2011-11-06T20:27:40  <VoidXC> that returns the shortest distance
2011-11-06T20:27:40  <roflmao> that's a standard manhattan heuristic
2011-11-06T20:27:46  <roflmao> yep :)
2011-11-06T20:27:51  <roflmao> I think they have eucledian in there as well
2011-11-06T20:28:04  <roflmao> also — the heuristic you use produces a different walking pattern
2011-11-06T20:28:13  <roflmao> manhattan produces a walking pattern like a right angle
2011-11-06T20:28:17  <roflmao> first goes straight in one direction
2011-11-06T20:28:21  <roflmao> then goes straight in another
2011-11-06T20:28:28  <roflmao> eucledian produces a zigzag
2011-11-06T20:28:44  <VoidXC> oh ok
2011-11-06T20:28:55  <roflmao> but in reality they both do the same thing in terms of optimal path
2011-11-06T20:29:07  <roflmao> what do you want to use a star for?
2011-11-06T20:29:40  <VoidXC> I thought I would use it for finding the shortest path from an ant to a goal (food, enemy ant colony, etc)
2011-11-06T20:29:47  <roflmao> yea, bad idea
2011-11-06T20:29:49  <roflmao> unless it is one ant
2011-11-06T20:30:02  <roflmao> if you have a specific objective for one ant then a star is good
2011-11-06T20:30:05  <roflmao> otherwise use bfs
2011-11-06T20:30:08  <VoidXC> was gonna use it for all my ants, given that my ants have a goal
2011-11-06T20:30:14  <roflmao> you can't
2011-11-06T20:30:20  <roflmao> because the heuristic uses a target and destination
2011-11-06T20:30:41  <roflmao> so a-star is specifically for one-to-one
2011-11-06T20:30:43  <hjax> i just realized something stupid
2011-11-06T20:30:52  <roflmao> BFS will give you a global costmap
2011-11-06T20:30:57  <roflmao> do one bfs from all the food goals
2011-11-06T20:31:06  <roflmao> and you will have  a costmap you can use for all your hundreds of ants
2011-11-06T20:31:11  <hjax> i can use the same bfs grid on multiple ants with the same target >.> instead of recalculating it
2011-11-06T20:31:13  <roflmao> so it is much more efficient

2011-11-06T20:34:24  <hjax> Extrarius: you can tell me too :P
2011-11-06T20:34:28  <VoidXC> so for the bfs with food, you do a BFS from every food location, and stop as soon as you find an ant location - this is the closest ant - and then give that ant the path?
2011-11-06T20:34:41  <roflmao> VoidXC: nononono :)
2011-11-06T20:34:55  <roflmao> VoidXC: bfs uses a FIFO queue, first in first out
2011-11-06T20:35:02  <roflmao> which means that you can do ONE bfs
2011-11-06T20:35:10  <roflmao> for ALL food locations
2011-11-06T20:35:16  <hjax> VoidXC: im finding the target first, then using bfs to get there
2011-11-06T20:35:20  <roflmao> pass in all your food locations as the initial open_set
2011-11-06T20:35:28  <hjax> roflmao: i still dont understand that
2011-11-06T20:35:29  <Extrarius> VoidXC: For food, I make a map filled with a max value, set the value at each food to 0, then set every square to 1 + the min of its neighbors
2011-11-06T20:35:59  <roflmao> hjax: have you seen a heightmap?
2011-11-06T20:36:05  <roflmao> black and white, some games use it for generating terrain
2011-11-06T20:36:12  <hjax> uh no
2011-11-06T20:36:19  <Extrarius> iterate the last step until it converges, then you have a map that tells you the direction to go for food from any square on the map
2011-11-06T20:37:03  <Extrarius> you can do the same for enemy ants, hills, unseen squares, etc
2011-11-06T20:37:20  <roflmao> hjax: k, nevermind, doesn't work anyways as an analogy :P
2011-11-06T20:37:28  <amstan> Extrarius: that seems like A*, with a metric that's valid for multiple destinations
2011-11-06T20:37:38  <roflmao> hjax: since the queue is FIFO. when you add ALL foods to the open set and roll with that as your starting point
2011-11-06T20:37:45  <amstan> Extrarius: but it seems easy
2011-11-06T20:37:47  <roflmao> hjax: ALL those foods will be evaluated first before any neighbors are evaluated
2011-11-06T20:37:55  <Extrarius> amstan: more like bfs starting at all the target locations
2011-11-06T20:37:58  <roflmao> hjax: so the balance of "neighbor evaluation" is completely fair and even
2011-11-06T20:38:07  <Extrarius> but that is just to generate the influence maps

2011-11-06T20:40:11  <Extrarius> D*-Lite being a good algorithm for dynamic enviroments (ie 'hey, there is a wall there I didn't know about a moment ago), and the 'moving target' part being a modification that makes it more efficient if you're chasing something down or change targets etc
2011-11-06T20:40:52  <pedrosorio> Extrarius: your "map" is equivalent to performing BFS simultaneously from all food locations
2011-11-06T20:41:35  <Extrarius> pedrosorio: yep, and I believe I said that above when amstan said it was like A*
2011-11-06T20:41:49  <pedrosorio> Extrarius: ups
2011-11-06T20:41:51  <pedrosorio> xD
2011-11-06T20:42:41  <Extrarius> I don't implemented it like a common BFS, I just have while (changed) with two for loops to iterate over the map and update every square
2011-11-06T20:43:49  <Extrarius> now you that you know my secrets, you too can have a rank in the 300-500 range on fluxid =-)
2011-11-06T20:45:35  <roflmao> arighty
2011-11-06T20:46:38  <Extrarius> I still (apparently) havent' figured out a good way to make use of in the information provided by the influence maps i generate, maybe you can do better =-)

2011-11-06T20:46:47  <roflmao> numbers represent steps to target
2011-11-06T20:46:55  <roflmao> so your ant would go to a neighbor with the lowest number
2011-11-06T20:47:03  <roflmao> when you calculate it with two objectives
2011-11-06T20:47:12  <roflmao> it simply creates a "combined" map that also works
2011-11-06T20:47:38  <roflmao> and if the ant is closer to the purple objective (neighbor tiles have lower cost) it will move towards purple
2011-11-06T20:47:43  <roflmao> if ant is closer to green objective
2011-11-06T20:47:45  <roflmao> it will move to green
2011-11-06T20:48:10  <roflmao> i put the numbers in different colors so you could see from which target they "stemmed" from
2011-11-06T20:48:20  <hjax> ohhh i understand know
2011-11-06T20:48:23  <hjax> now*

2011-11-06T20:48:39  <roflmao> that you do NOT 'revisit' a node you have already visited in your bfs algorithm
2011-11-06T20:48:45  <roflmao> if a number has been generator on X,Y Tile
2011-11-06T20:48:50  <roflmao> you do not regenerate a number from it
2011-11-06T20:48:59  <roflmao> e.g. from purple's perspective
2011-11-06T20:49:04  <foob> when does the turn-timer start counting? from when we receive "turn #" or when we receive "go"
2011-11-06T20:49:06  <hjax> i was assigning ants to the food instead of foods to ants
2011-11-06T20:49:08  <roflmao> the green 4's are actually 5's,
2011-11-06T20:49:17  <roflmao> yea you do the bfs from the target
2011-11-06T20:49:23  <roflmao> if you do it from the source it doesn't work
2011-11-06T20:49:34  <roflmao> so simply do a bfs where you pass in a list of all your foods as the starting "open_set"
2011-11-06T20:49:38  <roflmao> and it will work
2011-11-06T20:49:43  <roflmao> one bfs map for all your foods for all your ants

2011-11-06T20:50:19  <hjax> i wasnt planning on using bfs for the decision making of what foods an ant should go for
2011-11-06T20:50:22  <bugnuts> or most accurately from when your process gets it's SIGCONT to resume
2011-11-06T20:50:52  <roflmao> hjax: it works so I recommend :)
2011-11-06T20:51:11  <hjax> but doing i have to apply bfs for the entire visable map then?
2011-11-06T20:51:17  <hjax> dont*
2011-11-06T20:51:27  <roflmao> yes you do
2011-11-06T20:51:32  <roflmao> bfs is by definition exhaustive
2011-11-06T20:51:48  <Extrarius> hjax: you don't have to use it directly, but it is valuable information to have available for other algorithms
2011-11-06T20:52:10  <foob> bugnuts: thanks!
2011-11-06T20:52:46  <VoidXC> Now for the graph on which this bfs will be run, do you generate it every turn or somehow only add information to it that is new, ie stuff that just became visible?
2011-11-06T20:52:48  <hjax> hmmm i was just planning on doing bfs to the sight range of the ant that saw the food, but i suppose if theres 5 ants i dont want to do it 5 times
2011-11-06T20:53:33  <roflmao> hjax: bfs should not be expensive
2011-11-06T20:53:38  <roflmao> it is way cheaper to do one bfs for all your ants
2011-11-06T20:53:45  <roflmao> err for all your foods
2011-11-06T20:53:52  <roflmao> and that one bfs works for every single ant on your map
2011-11-06T20:54:03  <roflmao> if you have 150 that's a 150 pathfinds combined into one
2011-11-06T20:54:20  <hjax> what if i did it backwords?
2011-11-06T20:54:53  <roflmao> what do you mean
2011-11-06T20:55:00  <hjax> applied bfs for all of my ants, because then it would be much easier to find the closest ant to something, and theyd path the same
2011-11-06T20:55:08  <roflmao> doesn't work
2011-11-06T20:55:17  <roflmao> bfs gives you cost-to-target
2011-11-06T20:55:26  <roflmao> so an applied bfs for all your ants would give you the best path TO your ants
2011-11-06T20:55:35  <roflmao> which, actually, can be useful for certain things
2011-11-06T20:55:38  <roflmao> but not for food gathering
2011-11-06T20:56:02  <hjax> yes, and then my ants backtrack the path and its identical to the best path to the foos
2011-11-06T20:56:15  <Extrarius> hjax: yes, that is a valid approach also
2011-11-06T20:56:41  <roflmao> don't quite get it
2011-11-06T20:57:10  <hjax> ill make a drawing :P, brb
2011-11-06T20:57:30  <Extrarius> roflmao: do bfs from the ants, then iterate over foods to find the closest ant and trace the path from the food to the ant and use that path in reverse for the ant

2011-11-06T22:57:08  <marina> bmh: that would be great
2011-11-06T22:57:22  <bmh> it's pretty braindead
2011-11-06T22:57:24  <bmh> but it works
2011-11-06T22:57:26  <jmcarthur> marina: depending on the version of ghc you have you may need to use the --make flag
2011-11-06T22:57:35  <marina> tried both with same result
2011-11-06T22:57:40  <marina> what's your version of it?
2011-11-06T22:57:48  <bmh> https://gist.github.com/771d2eacc23a8a6c579a
2011-11-06T22:57:51  <jmcarthur> i'm on the bleeding edge
2011-11-06T22:57:59  <jmcarthur> 7.2
2011-11-06T22:58:01  <bmh> jmcarthur: dammit, someone else is using haskell!
2011-11-06T22:58:14  <jmcarthur> bmh: it's okay, i'm not taking it very seriously ^_^
2011-11-06T22:58:16  <marina> bmh: they forced me ;)
2011-11-06T22:58:22  <bmh> marina: they?
2011-11-06T22:58:38  <bmh> I think my team is all using 7.0.2
2011-11-06T22:58:45  <jmcarthur> i mean i'm not taking the contest seriously. i don't mean to imply i'm not taking other haskellers seriously
2011-11-06T22:58:46  <marina> bmh: if i was doing it for my own fun, I'd pick something I know how to compile ;)
2011-11-06T22:59:05  <marina> my university uses this as a course project
2011-11-06T22:59:06  <bmh> marina: taking an AI class?
2011-11-06T22:59:12  <bmh> that's splendid!

2011-11-06T23:00:05  <marina> bmh: my method is pretty much the same, unfortunately
2011-11-06T23:00:07  <bmh> jmcarthur: I've been spending a lot of time rewriting the starter. I think the notion of a point as a tuple is incorrect
2011-11-06T23:00:51  <ecarpenter84> is there a way to see your score at the moment or enemies scores from ants.py
2011-11-06T23:00:51  <jmcarthur> bmh: what do you think it should be?
2011-11-06T23:01:16  <bmh> jmcarthur: Points should know about their bounds so you don't need to pass around World or GameParams anywhere
2011-11-06T23:01:27  <bmh> Point row col maxRow maxCol
2011-11-06T23:01:38  <ecarpenter84> i wondered how much faster you could get your code running with a customer starter
2011-11-06T23:01:47  <jmcarthur> ah. i'm just making my Coord type opaque and have all the functions that need it require the map dimensions as a parameter
2011-11-06T23:02:11  <jmcarthur> if i was using a nicer type system i would put the dimensions in the type
2011-11-06T23:02:32  <jmcarthur> but i don't have the patience to write an agda bot ;)
2011-11-06T23:02:41  <bmh> jmcarthur: I'm happy to compete with you for "best haskell bot"
2011-11-06T23:02:56  <jmcarthur> i'd be easy competition. as i said, i'm not taking this contest too seriously
2011-11-06T23:03:04  <jmcarthur> not this time at least
2011-11-06T23:03:16  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: but.. what about your universal UCT algorithm?  can't you apply it to ants here?

2011-11-06T23:05:49  <jmcarthur> although i did say earlier i might try to use the most inappropriate kind of AI i can think of to see if i can make it work anyway
2011-11-06T23:06:04  <a1k0n> that's easy: genetic programming
2011-11-06T23:06:12  <a1k0n> set it and forget it!
2011-11-06T23:06:12  <jmcarthur> that's what i was thinking
2011-11-06T23:06:13  <bmh> a1k0n: you type faster than me, even on a phone.
2011-11-06T23:06:23  <a1k0n> oh i'm on my lappy now
2011-11-06T23:06:24  <treeform> no love for genetic programming?
2011-11-06T23:06:29  <jmcarthur> or maybe neural networks :P
2011-11-06T23:07:43  <a1k0n> don't get me wrong, i will admit to implementing genetic programming before, in a pretty clever purely functional datastructure way
2011-11-06T23:07:58  <a1k0n> haskell would be perfect for that
2011-11-06T23:08:02  <bmh> Why not some zany Gibbs sampler?
2011-11-06T23:08:13  <a1k0n> because that's probbaly actually a good idea somehow
2011-11-06T23:08:18  <bmh> My applied mathematician friends use those words a lot and sound smart.
2011-11-06T23:08:22  <a1k0n> haha
2011-11-06T23:08:34  <a1k0n> well, if we only had a generative model..
2011-11-06T23:08:54  <bmh> a1k0n: I'm taking a stab at the diffusive model once I clean up my infrastructure
2011-11-06T23:09:05  <bmh> I'm going to have a generative model of the unobserved world.
2011-11-06T23:09:07  <a1k0n> you should submit something aside from the starter bot
2011-11-06T23:09:13  <jmcarthur> i should go for language processing so i can just tell my bot, in english, to win the game

2011-11-06T23:22:04  <bmh> yep.
2011-11-06T23:30:13  <Antimony> I'm still trying to figure out how to do a good defense
2011-11-06T23:30:28  <Antimony> I programmged my bot to keep all ants at least as close as closest possible enemy
2011-11-06T23:30:36  <Antimony> but that measn they don't collect food or explore
2011-11-06T23:35:56  <bmh> That seems like a strictly bad directive.
2011-11-06T23:36:12  <bmh> You don't need to keep the whole army near your hill, just enough to repel invaders. And remember to count eatable food as ants.
2011-11-06T23:45:35  <ReverendFlibble> Are there persons here I can ask about rules of competition
2011-11-06T23:47:10  <Antimony> ok, you know what? The solution to every problem is more brute force
2011-11-06T23:47:11  <treeform> i read the rules on the site? does that count?
2011-11-06T23:47:29  <ReverendFlibble> no.
2011-11-06T23:47:31  <Antimony> Every frame, for every hill, I'll loop through all ants and assign the closest n as guards
2011-11-06T23:47:59  <treeform> Antimony: if you watch more adanved bots play
2011-11-06T23:48:04  <treeform> they don't have graurds
2011-11-06T23:48:19  <treeform> but they exercise territory control
2011-11-06T23:48:30  <treeform> they don't let other ants int by holding teretory
2011-11-06T23:48:59  <Antimony> my guards aren't restricted to being next to the mound
2011-11-06T23:49:08  <Antimony> they just have to be closer than any possible enemy ant
2011-11-06T23:49:20  <treeform> ok
2011-11-06T23:49:48  <ecarpenter84> is ants.distance consisent / appropirate for a*
2011-11-06T23:50:12  <Antimony> its consistant but not appropriate
2011-11-06T23:50:16  <Antimony> you need to use manhattan dist
2011-11-06T23:50:45  <ecarpenter84> oh i thought it was
2011-11-06T23:51:01  <ecarpenter84> is there a prebuilt manhattan that respects wrapping

2011-11-06T23:54:35  <ecarpenter84> good iea
2011-11-06T23:54:41  <treeform> thats what i did i think distance is very simple
2011-11-06T23:55:25  <ecarpenter84> for the recursive reconstruct node part of the astar
2011-11-06T23:55:34  <ecarpenter84> is there a better way then copying the lists for each recursion in python
2011-11-06T23:55:49  <treeform> its pretty fun watching new version of my AI beat older versions that I wrote.
2011-11-06T23:56:02  <a1k0n> it's depressing when the opposite starts to happen
2011-11-06T23:56:06  <AVAVT> also, I don't think default ant.distance is consistent for a* (at least in my starter Java package), it return distance^2 instead of distance, which is certainly not healthy for A*
2011-11-06T23:56:44  <treeform> a1k0n: yeah i have those moments too, but i normally know how to fix it.
2011-11-06T23:57:09  <ecarpenter84> i was also thinking that i should set a max radius of considered nodes or something
2011-11-06T23:57:15  <treeform> any one have a good solution for micro level fighting?
2011-11-06T23:57:30  <treeform> thats one thing i am struggling to crack
