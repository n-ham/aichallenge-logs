2011-03-06T00:00:08  <janzert> ahh, I missed that
2011-03-06T00:00:17  <McLeopold> Unless I'm missing something big, TrueSkill doesn't have a magical "pick the perfect opponent" piece.
2011-03-06T00:00:51  <McLeopold> These are bots, not humans.  We don't care about "fun" matches.  We want matches the drop the sigma the most.
2011-03-06T00:01:10  <janzert> yes
2011-03-06T00:01:43  <McLeopold> What we don't want is repeat games.
2011-03-06T00:01:55  <janzert> we also have to make sure that trueskill isn't getting fooled if the graph of opponents isn't well connected
2011-03-06T00:02:08  <bss03> McLeopold: Currently, this picks the "best" matchup, but not really iteratively.
2011-03-06T00:02:39  <bss03> McLeopold: Like, once it chooses a map, if there's not enough valid players to fill that map, it'll just fail.
2011-03-06T00:02:46  <McLeopold> bss03: yes, we constrain the pool of bots to avoid repeats, then we pick the best match.
2011-03-06T00:03:29  <McLeopold> bss03: we'll need to think of fallback methods if we can't get a game for a seeded player.
2011-03-06T00:03:49  <bss03> It's not exactly well-documented, even in the python I have, but the way XboX Live pairing work is that it chooses matches most likely to end in a draw.
2011-03-06T00:04:04  <bss03> I.e. players of similar skill ranges.
2011-03-06T00:04:06  <McLeopold> right, that's the "fun" factor
2011-03-06T00:04:15  <McLeopold> not as important for bots
2011-03-06T00:04:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what are you planning to call map files?
2011-03-06T00:04:26  <antimatroid> map1.map looks weird
2011-03-06T00:04:29  <McLeopold> are main concern is no repeat games
2011-03-06T00:04:38  <McLeopold> antimatroid: maps?
2011-03-06T00:04:41  <janzert> so a concern for making any ranking system work well is that we have a well connected graph of all the players and also that the maximum shortest path is kept relatively low
2011-03-06T00:05:02  <janzert> so far as I know trueskill doesn't have anything builtin to help ensure that
2011-03-06T00:05:03  <McLeopold> antimatroid: i figured we should think of unique names that describe the generation method.
2011-03-06T00:05:12  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-03-06T00:05:32  <bss03> Well, any two TrueSkill ranked players can be compared for match "compatibility".
2011-03-06T00:05:36  <McLeopold> janzert: I think the constraints I detailed in the wiki should help with that
2011-03-06T00:05:39  <bss03> It give a number between 0 and 1.
2011-03-06T00:06:33  <janzert> bss03: but that is just based on how close trueskill thinks they are in skill right or more accurately the chance of a draw between them right?
2011-03-06T00:06:57  <bss03> When adding a player to the map we maximize the product of "compatibility" between the new player and all existing players.
2011-03-06T00:07:00  <janzert> McLeopold: the only constraint there that encourages it from what I see is the no repeat matches one
2011-03-06T00:07:35  <bss03> Yeah, it's just based on (mu, sigma) values -- and the Beta variance.
2011-03-06T00:07:47  <McLeopold> yes, that's it.  We may need to tweak the variable X, but when done iteratively, it should provide well connected graphs.
2011-03-06T00:08:18  <janzert> bss03: yes, trueskill compatibility doesn't take into account the opponent graph at all so far as I know
2011-03-06T00:08:36  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah
2011-03-06T00:08:41  <McLeopold> what was the beta, I forget?
2011-03-06T00:09:22  <bss03> Beta is supposed to represent how big a "gap" there is in mu from the worst players to the best players.
2011-03-06T00:09:39  <bss03> Something like if mu1 - mu2 = beta the mu2 has a 20% change of winning.
2011-03-06T00:10:10  <bss03> The MS research paper uses initial_sigma / 2, IIRC.
2011-03-06T00:11:40  <McLeopold> It looks like beta is calculated from the mu and sigma

2011-03-06T00:12:37  <bss03> Also, the paper touches on the fact that the "fun" factor and the "minimizing sigma" ("informative") factor are the same.
2011-03-06T00:12:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it would be nice if the engine would support spawning food symmetrically so we can play with both
2011-03-06T00:14:10  <bss03> McLeopold: From the paper "...The variance of performance is given by \Beta^2 = (\sigma_0/2)^2..."
2011-03-06T00:15:00  <bss03> But, they have said in other place that it might need to be tweaked acroding to the 20/80 rule.
2011-03-06T00:16:52  <McLeopold> we care about minimizing sigma
2011-03-06T00:17:43  <McLeopold> bss03: I'm going to push a schema change in a little bit.
2011-03-06T00:18:13  <bss03> For the initial sigma base beta we are using to be correct, our "worst player" should beat our "best player" once every 667601 matches or so.
2011-03-06T00:18:46  <bss03> Which, if ants is similar to PW, might be right.

2011-03-06T00:19:49  <bss03> McLeopold: What I mean is they they argue that by choosing these "most liekly to draw" matches, they are BOTH minimizing sigma and choosing "fun" games.

2011-03-06T00:23:14  <McLeopold> bss03: ok, so close matches (aka "fun") will drop the sigma the most.

2011-03-06T02:45:01  <lavalamp> yeah the one in there appears to be js
2011-03-06T02:45:46  <lavalamp> I'll just make the bot print something so I know it works

2011-03-06T02:53:20  <lavalamp> ah ok
2011-03-06T02:53:29  <lavalamp> might be a problem ^^

2011-03-06T02:59:07  <lavalamp> So I guess you have to figure out which squares you can see yourself. Didn't realize that until just now... :/
2011-03-06T03:02:27  <antimatroid> it's that or send a whole lot more input each turn
2011-03-06T03:02:40  <antimatroid> it's really not hard to work out
2011-03-06T03:05:47  <lavalamp> Yeah, it's not hard...
2011-03-06T03:06:00  <lavalamp> The python package doesn't seem to do that, though...
2011-03-06T03:06:32  <DrunkenPanda> its what i just did said before lavalamp !
2011-03-06T03:06:47  <DrunkenPanda> its make sad ! :D

2011-03-06T03:13:42  <DrunkenPanda> didn;t you also? :(
2011-03-06T03:13:43  <antimatroid> the point of the io format is to minimise the amount of it, not to make people recalculate what is already known by the engine
2011-03-06T03:13:53  <antimatroid> it wasn't my preference either, but I really don't think it's as bigger deal as you make

2011-03-06T09:38:08  <janzert> but jbroman also already pointed out the correct thing if you're just trying to test if it's there (i.e. val in seq)

2011-03-06T09:40:38  <jbroman> antimatroid: He meant that the 'find' method returns -1 instead of raising an error. Unfortunately, 'find' exists on string (and not list, as far as I can tell).
2011-03-06T09:40:53  <janzert> right

2011-03-06T09:51:07  <antimatroid> i originally liked the for row in matrix syntax for python, but does it get confusing for all of you too?
2011-03-06T09:51:27  <antimatroid> it's great until i decide after using it that I need to index more than the one data structure based on indexing values :\
2011-03-06T09:52:07  <janzert> use "for row_ix, row in enumerate(matrix):"
2011-03-06T09:52:21  <janzert> if you need the index as well as the item
2011-03-06T09:55:08  <antimatroid> hmm, yeah that needs a big clean, but the access code is correct i'm pretty sure
2011-03-06T09:56:36  <janzert> have you tested that pastebin on a real map?
2011-03-06T09:56:46  <janzert> you're map parsing looks wrong
2011-03-06T09:57:00  <janzert> ahh, no I guess it's fine

2011-03-06T09:59:42  <janzert> it'll be easy enough for McLeopold to do it, but you might want to wrap all your code into function(s) so he can import it and call it from another script

2011-03-06T10:06:55  <antimatroid> i'll do formating etc. after all that
2011-03-06T10:07:13  <janzert> raise an exception
2011-03-06T10:07:20  <janzert> formatting?
2011-03-06T10:10:35  <antimatroid> formatting output
2011-03-06T10:12:33  <janzert> it's a dictionary there isn't any format
2011-03-06T10:13:56  <janzert> btw, it should be fine to just reuse ValueError if the map is bad
2011-03-06T10:14:19  <janzert> i.e. simply 'raise ValueError("Specific reason map is bad message")"
2011-03-06T10:23:59  <antimatroid> i'll put that stuff in tomorrow
2011-03-06T10:24:15  <antimatroid> i'm terrible at going to bed, i've bene redditing :P

2011-03-06T11:04:56  <amriedle> mine is clearly a wrist strength problem most likely lo
2011-03-06T11:05:20  <amriedle> cause it is mainly my right hand, and i type mainly with my left

2011-03-06T11:23:32  <bss03> I'm already walking the game <-> game_player join quite a lot, so it's mostly easy to just check for player_id = 0.  If you feel it needs to be added though,...
2011-03-06T11:24:33  <bss03> I would guess that a submission_id is best.  We mostly schedule based on submission_id.

2011-03-06T13:04:32  <bss03> Will do.  Seems like I should map db.literal or something over it. instead of just str, but str works in this case.
2011-03-06T13:05:03  <amstan> bss03: that error says that that it tried to stringify the set, but it gave up when it found logs inside the set
2011-03-06T13:05:44  <bss03> That's what I thought.  It seems like it should recursively call db.literal (or somesuch) before doing the join.
2011-03-06T13:06:01  <amstan> nah, might be too much overhead
2011-03-06T13:06:15  <bss03> Since, its certainly possible there are things inside the set that need to be escaped.
2011-03-06T13:06:37  <amstan> bss03: they're nubers.. no need to escape numbers
2011-03-06T13:06:52  <amstan> unless you're not sure they're numbers

2011-03-06T14:12:47  <bss03> Right now, I'm creating a temp table with a "WHERE column IN ?" and the ? is the set, using it twice, dropping it and looping.

2011-03-06T14:22:23  <bss03> That's annoying, seems it is a MySQL limitation.  There's a simple work around to copy the table with CREATE TEMP TABLE LIKE/SELECT * INTO and then use them separately.
2011-03-06T14:22:43  <bss03> I'll look into that after lunch.

2011-03-06T16:11:14  <janzert> which was another safety

2011-03-06T16:15:34  <McLeopold> I'm thinking of moving the api stuff out of the main apache and into a python script that will serve the api calls.
2011-03-06T16:15:53  <McLeopold> so, it would be on a different port.  Thoughts?
2011-03-06T16:16:36  <janzert> hmm, for all but the setup call I would say consider dropping http altogether if you're going to do that
2011-03-06T16:16:59  <janzert> making a simple http request for the setup call is rather handy though
2011-03-06T16:17:20  <McLeopold> yeah, hitting a url is nice for testing
2011-03-06T16:17:32  <McLeopold> I still want to pass json as well.
2011-03-06T16:18:00  <McLeopold> I could pass pickled objects over tcp, but it wouldn't be as extensible.
2011-03-06T16:18:53  <janzert> as far as moving it out of php... either way I'm fine with I guess, having a python api server live in the manager does seem nice
2011-03-06T16:19:09  <McLeopold> okay, I'll run with that for now
2011-03-06T16:19:34  <janzert> having a separate http server seems a little ugly but... so either way
2011-03-06T16:19:36  <McLeopold> At least this way I can keep stuff in memory for api calls.
2011-03-06T16:19:45  * janzert nods
2011-03-06T16:19:57  <McLeopold> Plus it makes the move to zeta a little easier.
2011-03-06T16:20:24  <McLeopold> And, we can not publish the port being used, for security.
2011-03-06T16:20:54  <janzert> meh, I wouldn't publish it but would count on it being found anyway
2011-03-06T16:21:09  <McLeopold> that's why we have the keys
2011-03-06T16:21:54  <janzert> yeah, just we do need to worry about the security of that second server a bit more than with the way it is now
2011-03-06T16:22:06  <janzert> mostly DoS attacks is what I'm thinking of
2011-03-06T16:22:44  <janzert> hopefully it won't be a problem that someone pushes on us though
2011-03-06T16:24:43  <janzert> one possible easy thing is if we can find the range of ip addresses for amazon ec2 east we could maybe firewall it off for access only from there
2011-03-06T16:38:18  <McLeopold> janzert: if the manager tracks which workers have downloaded which submissions, I can attempt to hand matchups to the worker that is the closest to being setup
2011-03-06T16:38:42  <McLeopold> This might naturally divide workers into processing different skill levels.
2011-03-06T16:39:08  <McLeopold> except for new submissions, which would probably get downloaded to all of them
2011-03-06T16:41:45  <janzert> hmm, I'm not sure the added complexity is worth any gain
2011-03-06T16:42:42  <janzert> also even though all the workers should be identical I'd also worry a little about partitioning the players to certain workers
2011-03-06T16:42:57  <janzert> in case of any weird differences
2011-03-06T16:46:44  <McLeopold> in the servers, maybe
2011-03-06T16:46:53  <McLeopold> I'll save that for later then.

2011-03-06T21:53:52  <antimatroid> bleh, i don't know how to output space information
2011-03-06T21:54:00  <antimatroid> mcleopolds suggested way is a bit rank imo
2011-03-06T21:54:34  <antimatroid> { 'space': {0: 14, 1: 14, (0,1): 7} }    - you could end up with many (0,1,4), (0,2,4), etc. parts which all need sorting etc.
2011-03-06T21:55:52  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: your starter goes significantly slower under the normal linux scheduler compared to the BF scheduler, which is what i was running at the time i timed yours before
2011-03-06T21:56:09  <antimatroid> hmmm i wonder what causes that
2011-03-06T21:56:23  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: did you see my map partitions, I think they look cool
2011-03-06T21:56:30  <jmcarthur> which i find strange. this is the first time i've seen a program's absolute performance being *faster* under BF

2011-03-06T21:58:45  <jmcarthur> i assume the idea isn't to completely fill those spaces with ants

2011-03-06T22:01:19  <antimatroid> it's just me checking my map_analyzer is calculating "access" properly
2011-03-06T22:01:27  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-06T22:01:42  <jmcarthur> so kind of a voronoi thingy

2011-03-06T22:27:47  <antimatroid> woah, there's a strong preference for battle option 1 in the forums now
2011-03-06T22:30:13  <bss03> Link to vote?
2011-03-06T22:30:38  <bss03> I did pretty well in PW, but I think I want option 2 so I don't get bit by a huge learning curve.
2011-03-06T22:31:20  <jmcarthur> i still don't understand the learning curve argument. could you explain?
2011-03-06T22:31:30  <antimatroid> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1313&start=30
2011-03-06T22:32:12  <jmcarthur> j3camero has the same thought but wasn't able to sufficiently explain it to me
2011-03-06T22:32:13  <antimatroid> neither do i, as far as i can tell, both options require fairly similar macro strategies (you will want a tree for fighting ants), yet option 1 provides way more interesting micro and is easier to calculate, easier to understand etc. etc.
2011-03-06T22:32:25  <antimatroid> i understand j3camero's argument
2011-03-06T22:32:41  <jmcarthur> well, i understand one aspect of his argument
2011-03-06T22:32:55  <antimatroid> his is about a top bot just pantsing a lower ranked bot without even losing an ant, that's not possible with option 2, you have to lose an ant to kill some
2011-03-06T22:33:29  <jmcarthur> given that bot A has better micro than bot B, with option 1 A has a larger advantage against B than with option 2
2011-03-06T22:33:36  <antimatroid> the brick wall wasn't necessarily about that I don't think, but that's more that you don't want too many "walls" where it takes a significant amount of work to get absolutely any kind of improvement, but you're going to have some places like that anyway
2011-03-06T22:34:00  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm out for a while
2011-03-06T22:35:34  <jmcarthur> bss03: i should probably say this in the forums, but my problem with option 2 is mainly that the best strategy is to spread out as much as possible so that you stand the best chance of having one of your ants facing more than one enemy ant at once
2011-03-06T22:35:56  <jmcarthur> basically, a dumb strategy that "breaks" the game
2011-03-06T22:36:58  <jmcarthur> the flip side of that strategy is it also minimizes the chances that a single enemy ant can take out more than one of your ants
2011-03-06T22:37:30  <jmcarthur> add to that the fact that spreading out increases your spawn rate and that there is basically no incentive *not* to spread out, and you have a really boring game
2011-03-06T22:39:13  <jmcarthur> the most complicated thing micro-wise would be, once you have a high density of ants, pulling the bulk of your ants *away* from combat so that you have a sparse attack front and a dense swarm in the middle which is not fighting
2011-03-06T22:39:47  <jmcarthur> s/middle which is not fighting/back, away from all combat,/
2011-03-06T22:42:29  <bss03> Sorry, was edting the wiki...
2011-03-06T22:43:32  <bss03> With Opt1, it is possible to kill an ant without losing any of your ants a "0-for-1."
2011-03-06T22:44:09  <bss03> With Opt2, that's not possible, but it is possible to kill 2 ants and only lose 1 of your ants; a "1-for-2".
2011-03-06T22:44:44  <bss03> In both cases, being able to find those advantages will probably make a significant difference is ranking.
2011-03-06T22:45:25  <bss03> In absolute terms, the difference between a 1-for-2 and a 0-for-1 is little-to-nothing.
2011-03-06T22:46:04  <bss03> However, when looked at as an advtange ratio, the 0-for-1 is a much greater advantage.
2011-03-06T22:46:17  <jmcarthur> right, i agree with that
2011-03-06T22:46:29  <jmcarthur> but i don't think that's really related to learning curve
2011-03-06T22:46:45  <bss03> If those are difficult to find for newbies, it will leave a wide-to-insurmountable gap in that rankings.
2011-03-06T22:46:54  <jmcarthur> it just means that two closely ranked bots are less likely to draw
2011-03-06T22:47:06  <jmcarthur> i don't think it means they will be less closely ranked
2011-03-06T22:47:15  <bss03> That gap is where there is a sharp tend upward in skill, that that's the learning curve I want to avoid.
2011-03-06T22:47:57  <jmcarthur> so you mean you'd rather the top bots and the bottom bots be closer together in skill?
2011-03-06T22:48:30  <jmcarthur> i don't mean to give that a negative-sounding spin, although i do see it as a negative, personally
2011-03-06T22:48:32  <bss03> I mean that I don't want the newbies to be discouraged by a huge gap.
2011-03-06T22:49:42  <jmcarthur> alright. this boils down to the same argument that j3camero has i think, and i just disagree that newbies will be so discouraged by it. and i think that's really all i can say without starting to repeat myself
2011-03-06T22:49:44  <bss03> It might mean that bot rank 123 beats bot rank 124 80%+ percent of the time, instead of having a smooth incremental growth.
2011-03-06T22:49:52  <bss03> But, I really haven't decided quite yet.
2011-03-06T22:50:37  <jmcarthur> in my experiences and observations, newbies are amazingly resiliant to difficult things because they don't even know the limits of their own abilities
2011-03-06T22:51:15  <jmcarthur> when i was new to programming i did things that amaze me in retrospect
2011-03-06T22:52:23  <jmcarthur> i wrote a physics engine in hypercard when i was like 10 years old, for example. i don't say it to brag though. IMO, most newbies that are interested enough could do the same thing
2011-03-06T22:52:32  <jmcarthur> and that's my point
2011-03-06T22:53:17  <jmcarthur> ^^ was without access to the internet or anything, too
2011-03-06T22:53:54  <janzert1> bss03: In your new pairing method under future, why have the first method for choosing a seed player at all?
2011-03-06T22:53:55  <jmcarthur> newbies now also can benefit from the wisdom of other contestants, if they get involved in the forums or irc channel
2011-03-06T22:54:10  <jmcarthur> anyway, i'm leaving for now
2011-03-06T22:54:12  <janzert1> getting rid of it immediately removes an advantage from spamming
2011-03-06T22:55:02  <janzert1> and 2 and 3 are what I was bringing up the other day as what people had agreed on before
2011-03-06T22:55:06  <bss03> janzert1: I thought we still wanted to have new submissions play quickly.
2011-03-06T22:55:19  <janzert1> no just the player's first submission
2011-03-06T22:55:44  <bss03> janzert1: That way you quickly know if your bot fails to make any moves, or times out, or any of the other stupid stuff that can occur even after a good compile.
2011-03-06T22:56:12  <bss03> Oh, well, if we just want to prefer the first submission, then yeah, that can be dropped.
2011-03-06T22:56:14  <janzert1> we're suppose to add functional testing after compilation before accepting the submission
2011-03-06T22:56:29  <bss03> It makes things easier for me (or whoever gets around to implementing it first).
2011-03-06T22:56:56  <bss03> For epsilon?  I thought functional testing was put off until zeta...
2011-03-06T22:57:34  <janzert1> it should be easy to add for this one and I thought we would
2011-03-06T22:58:28  <janzert1> also was concerned in McLeopold's version the mention about not choosing submissions that had an invalid result from a game, do you know anything about that?
2011-03-06T22:58:37  <bss03> I don't see an "Issue" for it on GitHub at all.  I certainly don't see it labeled "launch", and the Matchmaking stuff can't really wait on anything that won't be ready at launch.
2011-03-06T22:59:09  <bss03> Yeah.  I thought I left a mention about that.
2011-03-06T22:59:34  <janzert1> there's lots of stuff not in the issue tracker that needs to be done before launch :)
2011-03-06T22:59:34  <bss03> He wanted an "invalid" submission to let the next submission in without waiting the "cooldown".
2011-03-06T23:00:45  <bss03> I don't think he's really told me exactly how to identify an "invalid" submission in the database, either.
2011-03-06T23:00:48  <janzert1> ok, I'll have to ask him about it. I just hope he doesn't want to go back to the old way of kicking submissions back out of the contest because of bad behavior
2011-03-06T23:02:13  <janzert1> e.g. crashing and timing out
2011-03-06T23:02:39  <bss03> I kinda agree.
2011-03-06T23:03:00  <bss03> I have a roomate that didn't like it when his bot was paired against a "failbot".
2011-03-06T23:03:14  <janzert1> that is something I'll be strongly opposed to it
2011-03-06T23:03:35  <bss03> It didn't happen too often, but it was a nearly information-free event, and he had to go back to the "end of the queue" as far as getting to play again.
2011-03-06T23:03:37  <janzert1> yeah, that rather sucks but it's worse when your submission is kicked out of the finals cause it timed out
2011-03-06T23:04:02  <bss03> Yeah, and hopefully trueskill should pair people against failbots less often.
2011-03-06T23:04:23  <bss03> Plus, even when it does pick a failbot, you might be in a 3+ player game and still get some good information.
2011-03-06T23:04:26  <janzert1> and functional testing should greatly narrow down the field of them anyway
2011-03-06T23:04:42  <janzert1> yeah, n-player games will help that aspect
2011-03-06T23:05:17  <bss03> Can you open issues?  There should be one for functional testing.

2011-03-06T23:07:26  <bss03> I worked on the TrueSkill matchmaking basically all weekend.
2011-03-06T23:08:35  <janzert1> Currently working on making automatic setup scripts for servers
2011-03-06T23:08:59  <janzert1> I'll wait for McLeopold to merge is branch back in before tackling functional testing
2011-03-06T23:09:17  <janzert1> actually before that I'll move compilation onto the workers

2011-03-06T23:14:15  <bss03> Wow, there's so much to do.  Are we going to be able to launch this month?
2011-03-06T23:14:29  <bss03> Plus, I can basically only chip in on the weekends.
2011-03-06T23:15:23  <amstan> bss03: maybe, maybe not
2011-03-06T23:15:24  <janzert1> yeah, the amount of change that is being done right now has me rather worried
2011-03-06T23:16:11  <amstan> janzert1: too much change for epsilon? or.. lack of change to actually start the contest?
2011-03-06T23:16:33  <janzert1> too much, it's gone quite a bit beyond a simple integration of ants to the current code
2011-03-06T23:16:57  <janzert1> not that the current code was pretty in anyway
2011-03-06T23:17:09  <amstan> janzert1: you mean stuff like the db schema?
2011-03-06T23:17:27  <janzert1> not just the db schema no
2011-03-06T23:17:53  <bss03> You mean like TrueSkill instead of BayesELO? *pout*
2011-03-06T23:18:05  <janzert1> no trueskill is necessary integration
2011-03-06T23:18:21  <amstan> janzert1: well what else?
2011-03-06T23:18:47  <bss03> Is there any issue marked "Launch" that doesn't actually need to be done before launch?
2011-03-06T23:19:08  <janzert1> reworking the worker api to use its own server is the other major one I recall off the top of my head
2011-03-06T23:19:11  <amstan> i don't think so, i was pretty conservative at marking them
2011-03-06T23:19:15  <amstan> but there's just a ton
2011-03-06T23:20:08  <bss03> If the launch is anything like last time, we need to be able to distribute matches from day 1.
2011-03-06T23:20:09  <janzert1> but that's just cause it's the one I talked with McLeopold about this afternoon
2011-03-06T23:21:01  <bss03> Although, I suppose last time the web server crumbled first.
2011-03-06T23:21:02  <janzert1> yep, and we have a way to do that already. I just think we're rewriting too many things from scratch
2011-03-06T23:21:14  <amstan> bss03: mysql
2011-03-06T23:21:23  <amstan> bss03: mostly because of no proper optimization
2011-03-06T23:21:37  <janzert1> instead doing the smallest incremental change that will get something working
2011-03-06T23:22:07  <janzert1> of course I'm as much at fault as anyone since I just rewrote the worker setup script from scratch
2011-03-06T23:22:15  <amstan> janzert1: lol, ya
2011-03-06T23:22:15  <bss03> Well, the TrueSkill stuff probably still needs some optimization...
2011-03-06T23:22:24  <amstan> bss03: does it?
2011-03-06T23:22:33  <janzert1> I have to admit I'm a bit worried about that
2011-03-06T23:22:49  <bss03> I have a feeling the triply nested "IN (subquery)" stuff could take a while.
2011-03-06T23:22:58  <bss03> But, actually, that's very little to do with TrueSkill.
2011-03-06T23:23:20  <janzert1> I'd much prefer that the code got the player information from the database then did a bunch of pairings all in python code
2011-03-06T23:23:27  <bss03> The triply-nested stuff was to handle 4.1-4.2.
2011-03-06T23:23:36  <janzert1> so the database could be out of the loop for most of it
2011-03-06T23:23:51  *** janzert1 is now known as janzert
2011-03-06T23:23:56  <amstan> bss03: why do you call it trueskill stuff, it's just the pairings
2011-03-06T23:24:03  <amstan> bss03: trueskill was finished afaik
2011-03-06T23:24:08  <bss03> I was told by MacLeopold to do it all in the SQL server.
2011-03-06T23:24:25  <bss03> Well, I had to implement trueskill matchmaking.
2011-03-06T23:24:44  <amstan> but are you actually using trueskill for that?
2011-03-06T23:24:47  <janzert> bss03: yeah I know he is the one that wants it that way, it just worries me
2011-03-06T23:24:48  <bss03> That's not actually very well done in the trueskill python package I was pointed at.
2011-03-06T23:25:06  <bss03> Yeah, I'm using the match making algorithm from the truskill paper.
2011-03-06T23:25:29  <bss03> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/TrueSkill-Matchmaking -- existing section is what is in my pull request.
2011-03-06T23:25:31  <amstan> bss03: oh.. i see
2011-03-06T23:25:54  <amstan> i was confused why you called it trueskill even though it was not actually importing the trueskill library
2011-03-06T23:26:42  <bss03> 1. I do the trueskill calculation in SQL, so I don't need the python library. 2. I couldn't like the "pairwise compatibility" function in the trueskill python library.
2011-03-06T23:27:29  <amstan> oh.. right.. about that trueskill library, it seems like dmj added a wrapper for it for no reason
2011-03-06T23:27:48  <amstan> unless we're actually going to use lists
2011-03-06T23:28:01  <amstan> but.. i really liked the player objects that the library wanted as input
2011-03-06T23:28:14  <janzert> bss03: so I imagine doing it all in SQL that there is a good gain in efficiency for doing one pairing but how about when doing a few hundred at once?
2011-03-06T23:28:45  <bss03> janzert: I was thinking about that just now cause you sort of mentioned it.
2011-03-06T23:29:27  <janzert> yeah, I was just wondering your opinion on it specifically :)
2011-03-06T23:30:12  <janzert> hoping you can maybe ease my mind a little ;)
2011-03-06T23:30:33  <bss03> I think it is diffiult to really take what we've got (or even the future plans) and just "grab N" instead of "grab 1".
2011-03-06T23:30:49  <janzert> although one good thing is getting replay data out of the database should be really nice boost
2011-03-06T23:31:00  <janzert> moved out, that is
2011-03-06T23:31:44  <bss03> But, each individual step will probably be faster.  Particularly if we set up the right indexes.
2011-03-06T23:33:31  <janzert> one thing that would probably help more than anything is if someone that really knows how to do a good job of putting some caching into the apache/php combo comes along
2011-03-06T23:33:42  <bss03> If I can write steps 1-3 as a single sql query then you can easily do "grab N" and get a lot of seeds probably much quicker.
2011-03-06T23:34:13  <janzert> yeah, and that's the way I used to do it with python pairing
2011-03-06T23:34:42  <bss03> But step 4 has to be repeated in a loop to fill out the map and I don't think you can easily "fold" multiple loop iterations into a single SQL query.
2011-03-06T23:35:17  * janzert nods
2011-03-06T23:36:55  <janzert> btw, for map selection I'd go with LFU and map priority is a hard priority ahead of any selection criteria
2011-03-06T23:36:55  <bss03> Well, maybe with non-standard SQL.  I think I saw a DB2 trick for doing it by SELECTing from a table you are currently INSERTing INTO.
2011-03-06T23:37:09  <janzert> i.e. any map not at the lowest priority isn't even considered
2011-03-06T23:37:55  <janzert> or priority could just be dropped altogether and a map enabled field replace it
2011-03-06T23:37:56  <bss03> A hard priority, really?
2011-03-06T23:38:09  <janzert> all it was ever used for was to disable maps
2011-03-06T23:38:14  <bss03> Based on manager/sql.py that means that "old" maps would be effectively dropped.
2011-03-06T23:38:23  <janzert> yep
2011-03-06T23:38:44  <janzert> that's exactly what it did
2011-03-06T23:38:49  <bss03> Oh, okay.
2011-03-06T23:38:59  <bss03> I'll try and remember that for when I can work on it again.
2011-03-06T23:39:09  <bss03> I'm 40 minutes. overdue for bedtime.
2011-03-06T23:39:24  <janzert> :) see you

2011-03-06T23:45:26  <janzert> Hey McLeopold, ready to merge in 20 hours? ;)
2011-03-06T23:45:34  <McLeopold> :(
2011-03-06T23:45:39  <McLeopold> ;(
2011-03-06T23:45:45  <McLeopold> :'(
2011-03-06T23:46:19  <janzert> btw, I saw your start of a page on worker api
2011-03-06T23:46:34  <McLeopold> I saw the remark about thinking there's too much change going on before launch.
2011-03-06T23:46:59  <McLeopold> I agree, I'll stick with php worker api for now.
2011-03-06T23:47:20  <janzert> can we change the calls to get a matchup and return result to generic task request/return
2011-03-06T23:47:22  <McLeopold> Also, I'm a dba, and the matchmaking *will* be fast.
2011-03-06T23:47:39  <janzert> actually maybe generic turn in isn't really a good idea
2011-03-06T23:47:49  <janzert> ok
2011-03-06T23:48:14  <McLeopold> so, one php file with a "request_type" in the json?
2011-03-06T23:48:24  <janzert> yeah
2011-03-06T23:48:43  <McLeopold> I don't think that gains us anything.  You still have to code for it somewhere.
2011-03-06T23:48:59  <janzert> and also the matchup queue maybe should be a generic task queue
2011-03-06T23:49:21  <janzert> yes, but the worker does one task at a time basically (or n tasks)
2011-03-06T23:49:24  <McLeopold> the matchups are very specific
2011-03-06T23:49:55  <McLeopold> okay, so, get next task, which could be anything?
2011-03-06T23:50:01  <janzert> right
2011-03-06T23:50:08  <McLeopold> yeah, let's do that
2011-03-06T23:50:25  <McLeopold> how do we decide what the next task is?
2011-03-06T23:50:34  <janzert> although at this point I'm only planning on compilation or run game tasks
2011-03-06T23:50:53  <McLeopold> they kinda work together
2011-03-06T23:51:09  <McLeopold> a new submission needs to be compiled and be run in a game as the seed player
2011-03-06T23:51:11  <janzert> I *think* but am not positive it should be any compilation task otherwise the next game
2011-03-06T23:51:45  <McLeopold> so, any game where the seed player hasn't had a game will have a compile task just before it
2011-03-06T23:51:47  <janzert> let the worker go ahead compile and test it then tell the manager it's ready to be paired
2011-03-06T23:52:32  <McLeopold> btw, tossing in some memcache is pretty easy
2011-03-06T23:52:45  <McLeopold> That will help with database thrashing
2011-03-06T23:53:19  <janzert> we don't know whether compilation is going to succeed until we finish so I'm not sure about doing the full pairing until then
2011-03-06T23:53:32  <janzert> oh
2011-03-06T23:54:12  <janzert> that reminds me of another pairing criteria I remembered (while in the shower of course :) )
2011-03-06T23:54:45  <janzert> when playing a new submission that has no previous games it should try to be paired with submissions that do have previous games
2011-03-06T23:54:57  <McLeopold> can you put that in the wiki?
2011-03-06T23:56:38  <janzert> ahh, nevermind I see bss03 already got it added in his latest modification of the page
2011-03-06T23:57:06  <McLeopold> so, my idea with valid game was this...
2011-03-06T23:57:08  <janzert> oops, no I guess he doesn't
2011-03-06T23:57:40  <McLeopold> If a bot compiles, but then crashes right away, the user should be able to upload a working bot without waiting for the cool down period.
2011-03-06T23:57:58  <McLeopold> The invalid bot will be marked as invalid and be taken out of rotation.
2011-03-06T23:58:47  <janzert> yes, that is the functional testing and the submission never enters the contest
2011-03-06T23:58:58  <janzert> cooldown isn't even invoked
2011-03-06T23:59:07  <McLeopold> so, part of compilation then?
2011-03-06T23:59:12  <janzert> right
2011-03-06T23:59:31  <McLeopold> okay, then we don't need the logic in the matchmaking
2011-03-06T23:59:39  <janzert> yep
2011-03-06T23:59:59  <McLeopold> But I'd still like to look for bots that crash often and take them out of rotation
