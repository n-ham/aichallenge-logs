2012-04-15T09:57:27  <thestinger> mcstar: http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/ pretty neat
2012-04-15T09:57:40  <thestinger> it's what emacs has always wanted to be
2012-04-15T09:58:39  <mcstar> hi
2012-04-15T09:59:05  <mcstar> thestinger: started watching week4
2012-04-15T09:59:11  <mcstar> incredible, 200 minutes of video
2012-04-15T09:59:14  <thestinger> lol
2012-04-15T10:00:14  <mcstar> i decided im gonna make a trueskill implementation in haskell
2012-04-15T10:00:22  <mcstar> thats gonna be my learning project
2012-04-15T10:00:30  <mcstar> (hope i will get the time)
2012-04-15T10:00:56  <mcstar> microsoft guys did one in F#, and is supposed to be ubercool
2012-04-15T10:01:12  <thestinger> I implemented a terrible naive trie :P
2012-04-15T10:01:27  <mcstar> im gonna take a look at your link in time
2012-04-15T10:01:36  <thestinger> only took about 15 mins, but I wasted an hour trying to figure out how to implement C++ iterators
2012-04-15T10:01:43  <thestinger> still haven't figured it out...
2012-04-15T10:01:46  <mcstar> haha
2012-04-15T10:01:47  <mcstar> wtf
2012-04-15T10:01:57  <thestinger> iterating over the nodes in the trie is a depth-first search
2012-04-15T10:01:59  <mcstar> why are they hard to do?
2012-04-15T10:02:04  <thestinger> so the natural way to express it is recursion
2012-04-15T10:02:12  <thestinger> mcstar: because it's 300 lines of boilerplate
2012-04-15T10:02:18  <mcstar> ouch
2012-04-15T10:02:24  <thestinger> I found a boost lib that does it for you
2012-04-15T10:02:33  <mcstar> boost boost, always boost
2012-04-15T10:02:38  <thestinger> but I don't really have the details figured out
2012-04-15T10:02:42  <mcstar> i get the feeling that you are a lazy guy
2012-04-15T10:02:46  <thestinger> lol
2012-04-15T10:03:07  <thestinger> mcstar: you basically have to read the C++ standard to implement them
2012-04-15T10:03:10  <thestinger> and know it really well
2012-04-15T10:03:13  <mcstar> i dropped boost asio for libusb even XD
2012-04-15T10:03:16  <thestinger> or... use a lib
2012-04-15T10:03:50  <mcstar> and are you sure you need iterators at all?
2012-04-15T10:04:00  <thestinger> I don't need them but it's a learning project
2012-04-15T10:04:13  <mcstar> ah, so you want! to do iterators
2012-04-15T10:04:17  <mcstar> then dont complain
2012-04-15T10:04:19  <mcstar> XD
2012-04-15T10:04:21  <thestinger> lol :P
2012-04-15T10:04:34  <pairofdice> :D
2012-04-15T10:05:47  <thestinger> I made a method which returns a vector of the elements, I just need to switch to an iterator
2012-04-15T10:05:53  <thestinger> sounds so simple :P
2012-04-15T10:12:15  <thestinger> mcstar: the second section of videos is a relief though
2012-04-15T10:12:38  <thestinger> a bunch of neat little concepts
2012-04-15T10:12:45  <thestinger> instead of huge things that take 4 videos to explain

2012-04-15T11:13:26  <thestinger> mcstar: the problem set?
2012-04-15T11:14:09  <mcstar> no
2012-04-15T11:14:15  <mcstar> in video question
2012-04-15T11:14:19  <thestinger> oh
2012-04-15T11:14:27  <mcstar> when you need the new value to xor with
2012-04-15T11:14:31  <thestinger> I always get those wrong because I use the wrong syntax
2012-04-15T11:14:31  <mcstar> you start with 0x01
2012-04-15T11:14:34  <thestinger> well
2012-04-15T11:14:42  <thestinger> one time I gave the wrong answer and it thought it was right
2012-04-15T11:14:46  <thestinger> makes me feel like an idiot :P
2012-04-15T11:14:50  <mcstar> i managed to do them so far
2012-04-15T11:14:51  <pairofdice> heh
2012-04-15T11:15:03  <mcstar> but this really sucked
2012-04-15T11:15:06  <thestinger> mcstar: in the algo class, it they asked for a number and I gave 2/something
2012-04-15T11:15:09  <thestinger> the answer was '2'
2012-04-15T11:15:12  <thestinger> it said I was right :P
2012-04-15T11:15:17  <mcstar> Dan says 0x is just for hex numbers, a minute before
2012-04-15T11:15:20  <thestinger> s/it they/they/
2012-04-15T11:15:26  <mcstar> and now that damn thing didnt accept it
2012-04-15T11:15:40  <mcstar> ''?
2012-04-15T11:15:45  <mcstar> i see
2012-04-15T11:15:50  <mcstar> they truncated
2012-04-15T11:16:26  <pairofdice> 0x202?
2012-04-15T11:16:36  <mcstar> but that isnt correct
2012-04-15T11:16:47  <mcstar> you encode 1 byte with 2 ascii characters in 0-f
2012-04-15T11:17:03  <mcstar> this was always the case
2012-04-15T11:17:08  <mcstar> for homeworks and such
2012-04-15T11:17:25  <mcstar> and now what was i supposed to do? like on the slide? (02,02) ??
2012-04-15T11:17:29  <mcstar> thats just crazy
2012-04-15T11:17:35  <mcstar> what did you guys answer?
2012-04-15T11:17:40  <thestinger> 0202
2012-04-15T11:17:44  <mcstar> bleh
2012-04-15T11:17:45  <thestinger> maybe 22
2012-04-15T11:17:49  <thestinger> actually I think 22
2012-04-15T11:18:15  <mcstar> nice, well that isnt 0000001000000010
2012-04-15T11:18:24  <mcstar> nice, well that isnt 00000001000000010
2012-04-15T11:18:27  <thestinger> mcstar: I did those a while ago because I was interested in it, and then hit a video I found really boring and put it off for a week
2012-04-15T11:18:46  <thestinger> so I don't really remember
2012-04-15T11:20:17  <pairofdice> bin to hex and backwards is surprisingly convenient
2012-04-15T11:20:53  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-04-15T11:21:11  <mcstar> like saving space?
2012-04-15T11:21:36  <mcstar> but what is surprising about it?
2012-04-15T11:21:41  <pairofdice> easy, space, convenient, compared to decimal to binary
2012-04-15T11:21:55  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-15T11:22:08  <mcstar> you could use base 256 too
2012-04-15T11:22:24  <mcstar> if i were chinese id use that
2012-04-15T11:23:08  <mcstar> paintext
2012-04-15T11:24:24  <pairofdice> Alice and Bob
2012-04-15T11:24:53  <mcstar> i was surprised that ssh got it backwards
2012-04-15T11:27:48  <pairofdice> on 0 courses now but 4 new ones start tomorrow
2012-04-15T11:27:55  * pairofdice is a Udacity fanboy
2012-04-15T11:28:17  <thestinger> ml-class is starting soon
2012-04-15T11:28:19  <a1k0n> so i met the udacity crew yesterday
2012-04-15T11:28:25  <a1k0n> including david and sebastian
2012-04-15T11:28:28  <thestinger> nice
2012-04-15T11:28:28  <a1k0n> also got a shirt.  woot
2012-04-15T11:28:39  <a1k0n> </brag>
2012-04-15T11:29:08  <pairofdice> Oh, awesome
2012-04-15T11:29:41  <a1k0n> they were working through the weekend to get the launch done on monday but they held a little meetup at a bar in palo alto near their little shop
2012-04-15T11:30:38  <thestinger> https://www.coursera.org/course/ml :)
2012-04-15T11:30:49  <thestinger> I think I'll take 2-3 of the next round of udacity courses
2012-04-15T11:31:00  <a1k0n> they're pretty easy
2012-04-15T11:31:13  <thestinger> I know, I took cs101 and cs373
2012-04-15T11:31:21  <pairofdice> His methods lack pretty pictures for me
2012-04-15T11:32:12  <pairofdice> I understood it pretty well until neural networks

2012-04-15T12:21:28  <thestinger> I like that dereference returns a reference :P
2012-04-15T12:21:58  <mcstar> you need that for writing
2012-04-15T12:46:42  <thestinger> in this example the reference type is not a reference though
2012-04-15T12:52:04  <thestinger> hm
2012-04-15T12:52:07  <mcstar> ill keep this reference in mind
2012-04-15T12:55:34  <thestinger> I guess I need some arbitrary value as the end iterator
2012-04-15T12:56:27  <mcstar> try 0
2012-04-15T12:56:47  <thestinger> well, I think I can just keep it hidden inside the iterator

2012-04-15T12:57:19  <thestinger> I guess I need to use pointers and not references so I can compare them
2012-04-15T12:57:43  <thestinger> ah, yeah this will work
2012-04-15T12:57:54  <thestinger> I'll just use nullptr for the end sentinel

2012-04-15T14:31:36  <thestinger> this almost works
2012-04-15T14:31:52  <thestinger> I made the DFS iterative using a stack, and then made it work step by step for the increment method
2012-04-15T14:32:07  <thestinger> but it segfaults if it run increment in the constructor
2012-04-15T14:32:54  <thestinger> so there are 98570 elements output by the iterator instead of 98569

2012-04-15T15:21:05  <thestinger> I'm just using asserts for a test framework
2012-04-15T15:21:09  <mcstar> and you dont want that do you?
2012-04-15T15:21:12  <thestinger> none are in my actual trie code
2012-04-15T15:21:47  <thestinger> I just have test.cc which is what I'm actually running
2012-04-15T15:21:51  <mcstar> thestinger: how are you actually allocating memory for this?
2012-04-15T15:22:04  <mcstar> one pointer for every leaf?
2012-04-15T15:22:23  <thestinger> yes, I haven't turned it into a radix trie yet
2012-04-15T15:22:32  <thestinger> well
2012-04-15T15:22:50  <thestinger> mcstar: one pointer to each child
2012-04-15T15:22:59  <thestinger> and a bool to mark where sequences end
2012-04-15T15:23:17  <thestinger> I haven't decided on the way to handle the pointers to children yet
2012-04-15T15:23:25  <thestinger> for a std::string, there can be at most 256
2012-04-15T15:23:25  <mcstar> ok, so every node stores data, pointer to childs, and a bool
2012-04-15T15:23:30  <thestinger> no
2012-04-15T15:23:33  <thestinger> they don't store data
2012-04-15T15:23:46  <mcstar> i thought trie nodes do
2012-04-15T15:23:49  <thestinger> they have a bool and an associative array
2012-04-15T15:24:05  <thestinger> 'a' -> trie, 'b' -> trie, 'c' -> trie
2012-04-15T15:24:20  <thestinger> so when you retrieve values, you just build up a string as you walk
2012-04-15T15:24:41  <thestinger> this is just a trie_set so that's all it has
2012-04-15T15:24:48  <mcstar> i mean every node has a pointer to some data right?
2012-04-15T15:24:57  <thestinger> if it was a trie_map it would have a Maybe monad with data instead of a bool
2012-04-15T15:25:16  <thestinger> mcstar: each node has a bool marking the end, and an associative array
2012-04-15T15:25:23  <thestinger> the top level node is always false (not the end)
2012-04-15T15:25:28  <thestinger> so if you put
2012-04-15T15:25:34  <thestinger> tea, tree and tear into it
2012-04-15T15:25:42  <thestinger> the top level node has an associative array with
2012-04-15T15:25:47  <thestinger> t -> trie
2012-04-15T15:25:55  <thestinger> then that trie node has
2012-04-15T15:26:00  <mcstar> i get it
2012-04-15T15:26:06  <mcstar> seen such an exmaple
2012-04-15T15:26:08  <thestinger> e -> trie, r -> trie
2012-04-15T15:26:32  <mcstar> i just dont get this associative array part
2012-04-15T15:26:48  <mcstar> what is 'trie' here?
2012-04-15T15:26:53  <mcstar> isnt it a pointer to another node?
2012-04-15T15:27:18  <thestinger> well, all the nodes are just their own trie
2012-04-15T15:27:26  <thestinger> it's just recursive like a linked list
2012-04-15T15:27:31  <mcstar> yeah
2012-04-15T15:27:57  <thestinger> since there can only be up to 256 children (for byte strings), you can use a cheap structure for the associative array
2012-04-15T15:28:22  <thestinger> atm I've been lazy and just used boost::container::map (which would be stupid, but I don't plan on keeping that)
2012-04-15T15:28:44  <mcstar> so every node has a map that stored the location of the child nodes
2012-04-15T15:28:50  <mcstar> stored*
2012-04-15T15:28:52  <mcstar> stores
2012-04-15T15:28:53  <thestinger> yeah
2012-04-15T15:29:01  <mcstar> that is pretty heavy
2012-04-15T15:29:13  <thestinger> the map will just be an array though
2012-04-15T15:29:17  <thestinger> probably sorted
2012-04-15T15:29:25  <thestinger> since the max n is 256
2012-04-15T15:30:53  <thestinger> I'm not sure if a binary search actually saves much time on an array that small in C++
2012-04-15T15:31:01  <thestinger> so I'll figure out unsorted vs sorted later

2012-04-15T15:56:16  <thestinger> the iterative way calls the move constructor once (returning it)
2012-04-15T15:56:24  <thestinger> the iterator has no call to the move constructor
2012-04-15T15:56:27  <thestinger> I assume that's why
2012-04-15T15:58:02  <thestinger> mcstar: the iterative method and iterator are basically identical code
2012-04-15T15:58:20  <mcstar> thats what i though
2012-04-15T15:58:22  <mcstar> t
2012-04-15T15:58:38  <thestinger> but the iterative one has to return a vector of strings
2012-04-15T15:58:43  <thestinger> the iterator returns one at a time
2012-04-15T15:59:22  <thestinger> I assume it's all being inlined since it's simple
2012-04-15T15:59:44  <thestinger> for all the cases
2012-04-15T16:00:44  <thestinger> this is going to give me nightmares
2012-04-15T16:08:09  <thestinger> mcstar: ah, figured it out
2012-04-15T16:09:22  <thestinger> iterator is now 3.5s, iterative method is 3.4s
2012-04-15T16:09:32  <thestinger> (smaller set of test data due to impatience)
2012-04-15T16:15:26  <mcstar> thestinger: thats what i call optimiziation, instant 10 fold
2012-04-15T16:16:42  <thestinger> only 2x :P
2012-04-15T16:16:48  <thestinger> reduced the data set size
2012-04-15T16:17:04  <thestinger> made the recursive version faster though
2012-04-15T16:17:11  <thestinger> it's faster than the iterator and iterative one now
2012-04-15T16:18:02  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/446Lj49HJCSOEdXdiqcl/ since it only uses one vector and doesn't need std::stack
2012-04-15T16:19:43  <thestinger> for some reason I did it in a really convoluted way before
2012-04-15T16:20:13  <thestinger> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/SSQJhlbKaYlzG1LLxdgM/ 2x slower

2012-04-15T17:14:31  <thestinger> which question? (don't worry, I won't say anything)

2012-04-15T17:30:46  <mcstar> you know instantly if its right or wrong
2012-04-15T17:30:51  <thestinger> I mean I had a plain-text readable answer
2012-04-15T17:30:53  <thestinger> and I thought it was right
2012-04-15T17:30:56  <thestinger> but I made a dumb mistake
2012-04-15T17:31:14  <thestinger> I've probably made it obvious what the mistake was now :P
2012-04-15T17:33:35  <thestinger> well
2012-04-15T17:33:51  <thestinger> the explanation for why it was wrong actually gave it away
2012-04-15T17:35:25  <mcstar> i dont get this, but dont worry

2012-04-15T17:45:46  <thestinger> helps me avoid losing my place in the text
2012-04-15T17:45:54  <thestinger> if I stop to think about it, etc.
2012-04-15T17:46:12  <thestinger> and it's just a habit too
2012-04-15T17:52:39  <thestinger> mcstar: I'm still a bit unsure about whether I implemented this iterator right
2012-04-15T17:52:59  <thestinger> I don't think I did
2012-04-15T17:53:23  <thestinger> 'it == ++it' shouldn't be true
2012-04-15T17:53:28  <thestinger> >.<
2012-04-15T17:53:38  <thestinger> only the end iterator compares unequal
2012-04-15T18:06:43  <mcstar> thestinger: im pretty sure 'it == ++it' is undefined behavior
2012-04-15T18:06:53  <mcstar> anyway, i think i should watch the videos
2012-04-15T18:07:08  <mcstar> i skipped the last 3
2012-04-15T18:08:00  <thestinger> mcstar: well
2012-04-15T18:08:17  <thestinger> hm
2012-04-15T18:08:50  <thestinger> mcstar: if I have two iterators to the same container, I think they should only compare equal if they are at the same place
