2012-08-10T20:17:22  <delt0r> yes i did economics at uni
2012-08-10T20:17:41  <delt0r> hft is crock of ****
2012-08-10T20:17:55  <delt0r> if it was so good for everyone
2012-08-10T20:18:27  <delt0r> everyone would be allowed to participate
2012-08-10T20:18:33  <delt0r> QED
2012-08-10T20:28:46  <jmcarthur> i'm not convinced either way on hft, since that's not what i do
2012-08-10T20:28:58  <jmcarthur> also, hi :)
2012-08-10T20:29:37  <jmcarthur> there are definitely very unethical strategies that hft firms can (and probably do) use
2012-08-10T20:33:04  <jmcarthur> but i'm not prepared to attack or defend hft at all, although i might be willing to attack or defend specific strategies

2012-08-10T20:42:14  <delt0r> jmcarthur: then why can't we be part of it?
2012-08-10T20:42:29  <delt0r> why do you need to be special to do HFT
2012-08-10T20:43:03  <delt0r> several people have made a lot put of it... then they where told ...
2012-08-10T20:43:10  <delt0r> sorry no cigar
2012-08-10T20:43:15  <delt0r> you are not uys
2012-08-10T20:43:17  <delt0r> us
2012-08-10T20:43:23  <delt0r> here is a fine
2012-08-10T20:43:29  <delt0r> go to prison
2012-08-10T20:43:33  <delt0r> Really!
2012-08-10T20:43:53  <delt0r> you must be in the special crowed to be allowed to do it
2012-08-10T20:44:39  <delt0r> when your machines or algorithms barf/// you just get it all reversed
2012-08-10T20:44:54  <delt0r> anyone can win when you can undo wrong moves
2012-08-10T20:45:27  <delt0r> but we are not allowed... that mean the whole "HFT is good" is nothing but a pile of bs
2012-08-10T20:46:20  <jmcarthur> i'm not going to change what i am and am not willing to argue about
2012-08-10T20:47:14  <jmcarthur> in fact, i agreed with you that there are unethical things hft can do and haven't even said anything positive about it
2012-08-10T20:49:15  <delt0r> said like everyone who works in HFT
2012-08-10T20:49:23  <delt0r> good luck with that
2012-08-10T20:49:23  <jmcarthur> i don't work in hft
2012-08-10T20:49:43  <jmcarthur> hft works on small time scales we don't even really think about
2012-08-10T20:50:26  <delt0r> ms is not a small time scale --- its a bs time scale
2012-08-10T20:50:55  <delt0r> so why is 40% of the financial market HFT?
2012-08-10T20:51:11  <jmcarthur> 40% of what number?
2012-08-10T20:51:18  <delt0r> its a tax on all of us who don't have the legal privilege
2012-08-10T20:51:49  <delt0r> 40% of last year financial market profit was from HFT
2012-08-10T20:51:59  <jmcarthur> source?

2012-08-10T20:52:25  <jmcarthur> alright
2012-08-10T20:53:09  <delt0r> but i have a few freinds that work in the sector
2012-08-10T20:53:31  <delt0r> also i did economics at uni
2012-08-10T20:53:32  <jmcarthur> do you know / are you allowed to say  what company/companies?
2012-08-10T20:53:42  <delt0r> HFT is a pile of shite
2012-08-10T20:53:59  <jmcarthur> still not sure why you're trying to argue with me about this
2012-08-10T20:54:06  <delt0r> jmcarthur: i have signed many NDA
2012-08-10T20:54:13  <delt0r> ???
2012-08-10T20:54:50  <delt0r> guess i don't either... other than i want society to kick it in the arse
2012-08-10T20:54:55  <delt0r> it helps no oner
2012-08-10T20:54:57  <delt0r> one
2012-08-10T20:55:38  <delt0r> well except privileged rich duchbags

2012-08-10T21:06:48  <delt0r> jmcarthur: i am against anything that involves special privileges to a small group over the rest of us
2012-08-10T21:07:04  <delt0r> if its good for the goose
2012-08-10T21:07:16  <delt0r> its good for the gander
2012-08-10T21:07:19  <jmcarthur> an example of such a special privilege?
2012-08-10T21:07:27  <delt0r> HFT!
2012-08-10T21:07:37  <jmcarthur> that is a style of trading, not a privilege
2012-08-10T21:07:54  <jmcarthur> what are they granted that others are not?
2012-08-10T21:08:01  <delt0r> only very selected "hedge" funds or otherwise are perimeted
2012-08-10T21:08:16  <delt0r> the rest of us are *not*
2012-08-10T21:08:44  <delt0r> That is a special privileg
2012-08-10T21:08:46  <delt0r> e
2012-08-10T21:08:53  <jmcarthur> i guess i just need a source for this claim. i find it a bit vague
2012-08-10T21:08:58  <delt0r> if it was soo dam good for everyone
2012-08-10T21:09:11  <delt0r> we would all be allowed to do it
2012-08-10T21:09:27  <delt0r> but that is noting but bs to justify what they do
2012-08-10T21:10:13  <delt0r> jmcarthur: fine --- organize your own HFT...
2012-08-10T21:10:18  <delt0r> you can't
2012-08-10T21:10:27  <jmcarthur> then how did hft firms start?
2012-08-10T21:10:27  <delt0r> You are not the few
2012-08-10T21:10:36  <delt0r> Goldman ....
2012-08-10T21:10:42  <delt0r> shech
2012-08-10T21:10:48  <jmcarthur> this alone proves that we are not hft
2012-08-10T21:10:51  <delt0r> have you followed this at all?
2012-08-10T21:10:54  <jmcarthur> at least by your definition
2012-08-10T21:11:03  <delt0r> Whatever
2012-08-10T21:11:12  <delt0r> get out of the box
2012-08-10T21:11:16  <delt0r> look around
2012-08-10T21:11:28  <delt0r> it is really really doggy
2012-08-10T21:11:28  <jmcarthur> calm down, i think you misunderstand my position here
2012-08-10T21:11:58  <delt0r>  nothing personal... but seriously.... have you really looked at it properly?
2012-08-10T21:12:04  <delt0r> I think not
2012-08-10T21:12:15  <jmcarthur> you're making very angry crazy-sounding accusations and i'm just wanting some clarification because i'm not even sure what rules you're talking about
2012-08-10T21:12:15  <delt0r> anyway... need to go home
2012-08-10T21:12:20  <delt0r> ???
2012-08-10T21:12:25  <delt0r> I am not angry
2012-08-10T21:12:37  <delt0r> i am dancing to good rock
2012-08-10T21:12:38  <jmcarthur> alright, i'm just reading you that way
2012-08-10T21:12:45  <delt0r> sorry
2012-08-10T21:12:50  <jmcarthur> sokay
2012-08-10T21:12:51  <delt0r> you are reading it wrong
2012-08-10T21:13:04  <jmcarthur> then i will read over again with that new understanding
2012-08-10T21:13:08  <delt0r> not the way i am saying it in my head at least
2012-08-10T21:13:42  <delt0r> but at least i think this is a good time to sign off...
2012-08-10T21:13:56  <jmcarthur> alright. get home safely
2012-08-10T21:14:09  <delt0r> you too or whatever if you are home already
2012-08-10T21:14:13  <jmcarthur> home already :)

2012-08-10T22:40:02  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: I'm also interested in what your company does, or the cut to the chase, I'm interested in where game theory is used most with strategies in finance?
2012-08-10T22:40:41  <antimatroid1> HFT has the whole latency thing as well, and minimising latency isn't something which I personally find mentally enjoyable
