2012-02-13T12:53:08  <thestinger> yeah
2012-02-13T12:53:11  <thestinger> that entire thing is a std::wstring
2012-02-13T12:54:31  <thestinger> std::_Tree<std::_Tmap_traits<std::wstring, int, std::less<std::wstring>, std::allocator<std::pair<std::wstring> const, int>>, false>>::begin() at 0x8064a2f
2012-02-13T12:54:40  <thestinger> there it is without that crap, and with the C++11 >>
2012-02-13T12:55:15  <mcstar> std::pair<std::wstring> ?
2012-02-13T12:55:41  <thestinger> std::pair<std::wstring> const, int>
2012-02-13T12:55:42  <mcstar> i dont think c++ templates support partial application
2012-02-13T12:55:45  <thestinger> oh whoops
2012-02-13T12:55:50  <thestinger> added an extra >
2012-02-13T12:56:03  <thestinger> std::pair<std::wstring const, int> *
2012-02-13T12:56:07  <mcstar> ok
2012-02-13T12:57:15  <thestinger> so it's probably just a std::map<std::wstring, int>
2012-02-13T12:57:22  <thestinger> but the debugging thing is crap
2012-02-13T12:57:25  <rwest> THE SILENCE HAS BEEN BROKEN
2012-02-13T12:57:46  <mcstar> dont silence the broken
2012-02-13T12:58:19  <thestinger> yeah, std::map<std::wstring, int>::begin()
2012-02-13T12:58:44  <mcstar> nice
2012-02-13T12:59:07  <thestinger> probably a crapper debugger stepping through code
2012-02-13T12:59:12  <thestinger> crappy*
2012-02-13T12:59:35  <mcstar> isnt there some reflection supported in c++11?
2012-02-13T12:59:44  <mcstar> how about a typeof operator?
2012-02-13T12:59:53  <mcstar> i guess thats what did this
2012-02-13T13:00:15  <thestinger> there's RTTI but not by default
2012-02-13T13:00:20  <thestinger> so that's from debugging symbols
2012-02-13T13:00:42  <thestinger> there aren't really objects once you've compiled, unless you have reflection stuff in the code (and I don't think it's very good/useful)
2012-02-13T13:00:53  <thestinger> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types
2012-02-13T13:01:31  <mcstar> there is typeid
2012-02-13T13:02:05  <thestinger> I don't think that deals with templates at all though
2012-02-13T13:02:57  <thestinger> have to use inheritance and actual OOP for that
2012-02-13T13:07:27  <mcstar> St3mapIiiSt4lessIiESaISt4pairIKiiEEE
2012-02-13T13:07:38  <mcstar> thats the name of a map<int, int>
2012-02-13T13:08:27  <thestinger> lol
2012-02-13T13:08:43  <thestinger> probably specific to libstdc++
2012-02-13T13:12:29  <thestinger> but a debugger could use that
2012-02-13T13:13:18  <mcstar> probably uncle could tell us the circumstances
2012-02-13T13:13:29  <mcstar> but he just waits in silence...
2012-02-13T13:16:21  <mcstar> thhis reminds me, that i dont really like talking about c++

2012-02-13T13:26:37  <mcstar> thestinger: im glad you found that pearl
2012-02-13T13:27:28  <mcstar> UncleVasya: then say "when he will go home:
2012-02-13T13:27:31  <mcstar> "
2012-02-13T13:27:38  <mcstar> or get home
2012-02-13T13:27:42  <mcstar> or be home
2012-02-13T13:28:17  <mcstar> if you say "will come home" sounds really like, coming to you, to home, where you live(probably married)
2012-02-13T13:28:54  <UncleVasya> ok, my bad.
2012-02-13T13:30:04  <UncleVasya> He too lazy to come here but I can ask your questions to him.

2012-02-13T13:30:42  <mcstar> is
2012-02-13T13:30:51  <mcstar> but i dont understand the second part of your question

2012-02-13T13:32:35  <UncleVasya> He pasted it to my ICQ and I decided 'wow, this is omething really scary, guys from AIC will enjoy it .'
2012-02-13T13:32:47  <UncleVasya> And you do enjoy as I see ;)
2012-02-13T13:32:51  <mcstar> not realy
2012-02-13T13:32:58  <mcstar> we are more like annoyed by it
2012-02-13T13:33:38  <UncleVasya> * do enjoy to talk about it
2012-02-13T13:34:06  <mcstar> UncleVasya: well, i hope we could help, and ofc thestinger likes to show off his problem solving abilities
2012-02-13T13:35:12  <UncleVasya> oh
2012-02-13T13:35:25  <UncleVasya> It seems I messed you.
2012-02-13T13:35:37  <thestinger> mcstar: :)
2012-02-13T13:36:10  <mcstar> thestinger: how fast can you type?
2012-02-13T13:36:17  <mcstar> im saturated at 40 wpm
2012-02-13T13:37:10  <thestinger> not sure
2012-02-13T13:37:38  <UncleVasya> By 'asked what the f*ck is this' I meant not 'he asked me to help figure out what is this' but rather in this sense: 'lol, was the guy who wrote this code drunk?! '
2012-02-13T13:37:39  <mcstar> i recently typed 2 chapters of moby dick
2012-02-13T13:37:49  <thestinger> I used to type at 60wpm, but I couldn't get faster because I wasn't actually typing properly
2012-02-13T13:38:00  <thestinger> so I had to force myself to do it properly, which made it a lot slower
2012-02-13T13:38:06  <mcstar> oh
2012-02-13T13:38:10  <thestinger> not sure if I've actually surpassed what I used to be able to do...
2012-02-13T13:38:27  <mcstar> i keep making mistakes if im doing it faster
2012-02-13T13:38:30  <mcstar> well, trying to
2012-02-13T13:38:36  <thestinger> yeah
2012-02-13T13:38:50  <thestinger> that's what would happen since I was moving my hands around too much
2012-02-13T13:38:54  <mcstar> i noticed im typing the fastest if im "disconnected"
2012-02-13T13:39:11  <mcstar> i like the feeling when it flows
2012-02-13T13:39:21  <mcstar> ktouch is a relly nice program
2012-02-13T13:40:19  <mcstar> UncleVasya: im moderately sure that a drunk guy could not have got it right
2012-02-13T13:40:47  <mcstar> (had he tried to write the raw template type)
2012-02-13T13:41:38  <mcstar> it is possible that malkavian was drunk, and thats why he didnt notice that it was s simple map
2012-02-13T13:41:43  <mcstar> how about that?
2012-02-13T13:41:47  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-13T13:44:15  <mcstar> thestinger: i have no idea how can hungarians touch type
2012-02-13T13:44:26  <mcstar> i mean original words, with acute characters
2012-02-13T13:44:32  <thestinger> oh
2012-02-13T13:44:40  <mcstar> all the those are reachable with the right little finger
2012-02-13T13:44:44  <mcstar> -the
2012-02-13T13:45:03  <thestinger> can you use a compose key?
2012-02-13T13:45:03  <mcstar> and our words are filled with acute characters
2012-02-13T13:45:08  <thestinger> I guess so
2012-02-13T13:45:12  <thestinger> but then you waste a lot of time
2012-02-13T13:45:29  <mcstar> and we have more than 1 type of acuteness

2012-02-13T13:46:15  <thestinger> yeah, I know french
2012-02-13T13:46:17  <mcstar> uüúú
2012-02-13T13:46:18  <thestinger> really annoying to type
2012-02-13T13:46:26  <mcstar> ű
2012-02-13T13:46:27  <thestinger> not nearly that bad though :P
2012-02-13T13:46:37  <mcstar> yeah?
2012-02-13T13:46:42  <mcstar> french is worse?
2012-02-13T13:46:45  <thestinger> no
2012-02-13T13:46:49  <thestinger> I mean hungarian is worse
2012-02-13T13:46:51  <mcstar> ah
2012-02-13T13:47:01  <thestinger> french just has some accents on the e for the most part
2012-02-13T13:47:03  <thestinger> sometimes on a

2012-02-13T13:47:52  <mcstar> the problem is that those are horribly placed
2012-02-13T13:48:02  <thestinger> oh, french has more then
2012-02-13T13:48:10  <thestinger> but they aren't that common, except on 'e'

2012-02-13T13:50:03  <thestinger> yeah, but I'm too lazy
2012-02-13T13:50:19  <mcstar> i dont think ill try either
2012-02-13T13:50:22  <thestinger> I don't really type that much
2012-02-13T13:50:30  <thestinger> if I had to code C or C++ for a living, I would probably learn
2012-02-13T13:50:49  <mcstar> what will you code for aliving then?
2012-02-13T13:50:51  <mcstar> python?
2012-02-13T13:50:57  <thestinger> hopefully something like python
2012-02-13T13:51:06  <mcstar> whats the difference?
2012-02-13T13:51:20  <mcstar> typing wise ofc
2012-02-13T13:51:27  <thestinger> C++ has so much boilerplate
2012-02-13T13:51:41  <thestinger> autocomplete helps though
2012-02-13T13:52:14  <mcstar> whilte you type the boilerplate, you figure out the code you want to write next
2012-02-13T13:52:23  <mcstar> with python, you just stare at the screen
2012-02-13T13:52:31  <thestinger> yeah, I can't think fast enough for typing to matter in a language like python or haskell
2012-02-13T13:52:58  <rwest> pfft you guys and your fancy editors
2012-02-13T13:53:11  <rwest> with autocomplete and the like
2012-02-13T13:53:40  <thestinger> helps with laziness
2012-02-13T13:54:09  <mcstar> autocomplete and online help is very nice, when you are getting used to something
2012-02-13T13:54:14  <mcstar> for exmaple to qt, in qtcreator
2012-02-13T13:54:18  <mcstar> or in kdevelop
2012-02-13T13:54:28  <mcstar> you dont have to parse the documentation
2012-02-13T13:54:47  <mcstar> after a while, you can turn it off, but still could save some keystrokes
2012-02-13T13:55:02  <rwest> I was never a big fan of it

2012-02-13T13:58:47  <mcstar> like if he was angry?

2012-02-13T16:14:35  <mcstar> kraai: anything is possible, just ask specific questions when you get stuck
2012-02-13T16:14:57  <kraai> i've followed the instructions in INSTALL.md and added the maps that i found, but i can't get it to generate matchups.
2012-02-13T16:16:31  <kraai> i hacked sql/2_generate_matchup.sql to ignore the pairing_cutoff, then was able to generate a matchup by calling generate_matchup.

2012-02-13T16:17:39  <amstan> mcstar, kraai: yo?
2012-02-13T16:17:49  <amstan> kraai: pirate version? lol
2012-02-13T16:18:18  <amstan> kraai: i'm not exactly sure of that area of the code, you'll have to ask either McLeopold or janzert
2012-02-13T16:18:19  <kraai> how can i get it to automatically generate matchups?
2012-02-13T16:18:34  <amstan> it should automatically do it
2012-02-13T16:18:37  <amstan> how many users do you have?
2012-02-13T16:18:44  <kraai> 2 at the moment.
2012-02-13T16:18:45  <amstan> you need a bunch before it does it
2012-02-13T16:18:51  <amstan> yeah, try get like a dozen
2012-02-13T16:18:57  <kraai> oh.
2012-02-13T16:19:08  <mcstar> kraai: maybe you want a tcp server
2012-02-13T16:19:13  <kraai> tcp?
2012-02-13T16:19:17  <amstan> @tcp
2012-02-13T16:19:18  <contestbot> amstan: tcp could be http://ants.fluxid.pl/howto.
2012-02-13T16:19:23  <amstan> or not.. lol
2012-02-13T16:19:27  <mcstar> very easy to set up
2012-02-13T16:19:43  <mcstar> actually, i havent tried setting it up lol
2012-02-13T16:20:03  <kraai> 404
2012-02-13T16:20:28  <mcstar> it is still somewhere available in github-space

2012-02-13T16:22:04  <amstan> kraai: but if you can get the site going it would be nicer
2012-02-13T16:22:08  <amstan> it seems like you're almost there
2012-02-13T16:22:30  <amstan> with tcp you have to have clients connected all the time
2012-02-13T16:22:34  <amstan> otherwise matches don't play
2012-02-13T16:23:20  <kraai> sounds like having the site set up would be better.

2012-02-13T17:05:28  <kraai> yes.
2012-02-13T17:05:39  <McLeopold> still need help with the matchups?
2012-02-13T17:05:55  <kraai> yes, we now have three working submissions.
2012-02-13T17:06:39  <McLeopold> try running the opponent.sql sp to see what happens
2012-02-13T17:06:41  <kraai> when i call generate_matchup to create new matchups, it generates the following error: "abort matchup: could not find opponent"
2012-02-13T17:06:53  <kraai> ok.
2012-02-13T17:06:58  <McLeopold> probably there are opponents stuck in a current game
2012-02-13T17:07:30  <McLeopold> opponent.sql is the same as the generate_matchup, but it outputs a lot of information
2012-02-13T17:07:55  <McLeopold> besides the pairing cutoff, the first step is to verify the number of players

2012-02-13T17:08:06  <McLeopold> if you only have 2 bots, you'll need some 2 player maps
2012-02-13T17:08:26  <kraai> when i run "call opponent;", it says i'm missing a parameter.
2012-02-13T17:08:33  <McLeopold> pass in null
2012-02-13T17:08:55  <McLeopold> or a submission id, but null gets the next one in the queue
2012-02-13T17:09:59  <kraai> i get the "could not find opponent" error.
2012-02-13T17:10:19  <McLeopold> you are probably getting a seed player, right?
2012-02-13T17:10:35  <kraai> yes.
2012-02-13T17:10:55  <McLeopold> so, the next step is to list available opponents, which gets you 0
2012-02-13T17:11:24  <McLeopold> it excludes players currently in a matchup
2012-02-13T17:11:33  <kraai> it lists a table of 9 players.
2012-02-13T17:11:41  <kraai> is that what you're referring to?

2012-02-13T17:45:23  <McLeopold> yeah, git pull, then you'll need to run the sql to update
2012-02-13T17:46:17  <McLeopold> you'll see this message if there are too many players currently in a game:  matchup skipped because available players is less than smallest map
2012-02-13T17:46:22  <kraai> delete from matchup; delete from matchup_player; also?
2012-02-13T17:46:50  <McLeopold> yes, your database just had a bunch of error records
2012-02-13T17:46:58  <antimatroid> we need to do something about the spam
2012-02-13T17:47:03  <antimatroid> i'm deleting like 4+ posts a day atm
2012-02-13T17:47:37  <kraai> now call opponent (null); ?
2012-02-13T17:47:43  <janzert> McLeopold: I assume the problem actually was that no rank had been set yet?
2012-02-13T17:47:52  <McLeopold> yes
2012-02-13T17:48:16  <kraai> now i get "matchup skipped because available players is less than smallest map".
2012-02-13T17:48:24  <McLeopold> which means to use the pairing cutoff, everyone needs a rank
2012-02-13T17:48:31  <McLeopold> kraai: yes, that's good
2012-02-13T17:48:40  <McLeopold> now, you need a worker to actually start playing the games
2012-02-13T17:48:47  <kraai> i have a worker.
2012-02-13T17:48:54  <antimatroid> @later tell UncleVasya don't stop pointing out the spam, although I have also been trying to remember to check myself lately and getting even more
2012-02-13T17:48:54  <contestbot> antimatroid: I come to serve.
2012-02-13T17:49:12  <janzert> so the check for null cutoff could have been changed to just set the cutoff to max_players + 1 instead
2012-02-13T17:49:16  <kraai> it's currently awaiting a task.
2012-02-13T17:49:24  <janzert> not that it matters much
2012-02-13T17:49:35  <McLeopold> it doesn't, since I rewriting the matchup stuff :)
2012-02-13T17:49:58  <kraai> do i need to restart the worker?
2012-02-13T17:50:37  <McLeopold> I don't think you should have to.  You can manually check the response to an api request in a browser.
2012-02-13T17:51:02  <McLeopold> kraai: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Worker-Manager-Communication
2012-02-13T17:51:29  <McLeopold> try an api_get_task call
2012-02-13T17:52:35  <kraai> it seems to hang.
2012-02-13T17:52:53  <kraai> i thought it will only work if there's something in the matchup table.
2012-02-13T17:52:53  <McLeopold> that sucks
2012-02-13T17:53:08  <McLeopold> it should return a blank task, not hang
2012-02-13T17:53:08  <kraai> and the matchup table's empty.
2012-02-13T17:53:24  <janzert> it will keep retrying for quite a while
2012-02-13T17:53:31  <McLeopold> I think we switched the generate matchup to a service
2012-02-13T17:53:38  <janzert> right
2012-02-13T17:53:44  <kraai> a service?
2012-02-13T17:53:49  <janzert> well a script that runs it
2012-02-13T17:54:13  <kraai> there's a manager/matchup_buffer.py script that calls generate_matchup.
2012-02-13T17:54:22  <janzert> to stop race conditions since mysql isam backend doesn't have proper transactions
2012-02-13T17:54:26  <kraai> when i tried it before, though, it just filled the matchup table with errors.
2012-02-13T17:54:46  <McLeopold> but, now with the fix, it should do the right think
2012-02-13T17:54:48  <McLeopold> thing
2012-02-13T17:54:48  <kraai> should i try it again with the sql?
2012-02-13T17:54:54  <kraai> ok, will try.
2012-02-13T17:54:55  <McLeopold> that works too
2012-02-13T17:55:01  <McLeopold> one at a time by hand is ok
2012-02-13T17:55:42  <McLeopold> janzert: while you're here, care to discuss infrastructure details?
2012-02-13T17:55:52  <janzert> sorry, just leaving
2012-02-13T17:56:02  <McLeopold> :(
2012-02-13T17:56:06  <McLeopold> oh well
2012-02-13T17:56:13  <kraai> now prints "Buffer size set to 50", then "WARNING: Found empty buffer" and "Adding 60 matches to buffer already having 0" in a loop.  never adds anything to table.

2012-02-13T18:00:28  <McLeopold> change the max to 1 as well

2012-02-13T18:35:50  <McLeopold> kraai: if the matchup_buffer.py doesn't work for you, you can patch in the original method, which was to generate one from the php: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/fcf36ac3e8d67e3308cc82c9327ed4c29cec7be2#website/api_get_task.php
2012-02-13T18:38:53  <kraai> matchup_buffer.py goes into an infinite busy loop, so i'll try patching the php.
2012-02-13T18:39:07  <McLeopold> okay, with only one worker, you should be fine
2012-02-13T18:43:37  <kraai> thanks again.
