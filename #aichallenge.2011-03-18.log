2011-03-18T00:04:44  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-18T00:05:39  <davidjliu> is anybody here?
2011-03-18T00:05:46  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-18T00:05:48  <antimatroid> shoot
2011-03-18T00:05:56  <davidjliu> so, I was just reading the forum
2011-03-18T00:06:07  <davidjliu> and I'm quite a fan of the 2v2 idea that Stocha had
2011-03-18T00:06:07  <McLeopold> hello fellow pythonador
2011-03-18T00:06:13  <davidjliu> hello
2011-03-18T00:06:19  <davidjliu> where each bot is spawned twice
2011-03-18T00:06:32  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-03-18T00:06:40  <davidjliu> and has to decide whether each of the other ants is itself or an enemy
2011-03-18T00:06:43  <McLeopold> 2v2v2?
2011-03-18T00:06:56  <amstan> McLeopold: this: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1357
2011-03-18T00:06:58  <davidjliu> or just 2v2 I was thinking, but I don't see why not either way
2011-03-18T00:07:04  <antimatroid> i think it's unfeasible given the server constraints and the number of players we'd like to have
2011-03-18T00:07:08  <antimatroid> we could do a mixture
2011-03-18T00:07:17  <McLeopold> it's not unfeasible
2011-03-18T00:07:24  <amstan> davidjliu: the problem is that it doesn't give us any more info
2011-03-18T00:07:30  <amstan> davidjliu: it just complicates the game
2011-03-18T00:07:40  <antimatroid> McLeopold: all bots have to be running at once
2011-03-18T00:07:43  <McLeopold> if we are going to support 4 players or 6 players, why not 2 of the same bot
2011-03-18T00:07:55  <antimatroid> because then you go back to a 2 or 3 player game
2011-03-18T00:08:02  <McLeopold> so
2011-03-18T00:08:04  <amstan> McLeopold: but then we get only 3 opponents actually playingh
2011-03-18T00:08:08  <antimatroid> if we're doing n-player we might as well do it properly
2011-03-18T00:08:08  <McLeopold> so
2011-03-18T00:08:09  <davidjliu> I mean, I guess it does make the game dramatically different, but it seems to me to be more exciting than the normal ants game
2011-03-18T00:08:13  <amstan> McLeopold: when we could of had data from 6
2011-03-18T00:08:16  <davidjliu> as communication between bots is a lot more important
2011-03-18T00:08:25  <davidjliu> and it has dancing. which should be super exciting
2011-03-18T00:08:34  <antimatroid> option1 has dancing
2011-03-18T00:08:42  <antimatroid> for battle that is
2011-03-18T00:09:09  <amstan> we had this same dillema with random maps in planet wars, and playing the same map twice in order to make it fair
2011-03-18T00:09:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it's like clones for galcon online :D
2011-03-18T00:09:16  <amstan> you don't actually get more data
2011-03-18T00:09:26  <davidjliu> er, remind me what option1 is? I haven't really been following
2011-03-18T00:09:37  <antimatroid> battle options
2011-03-18T00:09:50  <davidjliu> I mean, I like it not because of "making it fair", but doing this dramatically changes the game
2011-03-18T00:09:51  <McLeopold> amstan: I don't think the point is to get more data, it is to make the game more fun and exciting
2011-03-18T00:09:55  <davidjliu> yeah
2011-03-18T00:09:58  <antimatroid> check the specs page: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-18T00:11:00  <McLeopold> davidjliu: in a nutshell, it's a 1:1 kill ratio vs a 0:1 kill ratio that is the difference
2011-03-18T00:11:02  <janzert> playing 2 bots of each player seems like too large of a cost for very little added interesting outcomes
2011-03-18T00:11:21  <davidjliu> the dancing in that case is more of a "tactical" dance than I guess an "expressive" dance, if that makes any sense- as in the dancing is a tactical manuever
2011-03-18T00:11:22  <McLeopold> janzert: I think you underestimate the added interest
2011-03-18T00:11:37  <McLeopold> it's communication
2011-03-18T00:11:43  <davidjliu> what the difference is that the bot doesn't know the identity of any of the ants it doesn't itself control
2011-03-18T00:12:06  <davidjliu> so it has to find out for each ant it encounters whether it is friend or foe
2011-03-18T00:12:11  <davidjliu> which probably will involve dancing
2011-03-18T00:12:18  <davidjliu> which could also be used to pass information
2011-03-18T00:12:21  <janzert> I don't see much communication happening beyond initial recognition
2011-03-18T00:12:35  <janzert> and that isn't terribly interesting to me
2011-03-18T00:12:38  <antimatroid> i think that's a huge step away from not setting up huge brick walls for people
2011-03-18T00:12:53  <antimatroid> i'm with janzert, but it is personal opinion obviously
2011-03-18T00:12:59  <davidjliu> there's the possibility of passing information from bot to bot, and then for the opposing bot to try to mimic recognition
2011-03-18T00:13:03  <davidjliu> but yeah, it might be overcomplicating
2011-03-18T00:13:35  <antimatroid> if you could communicate, you would just send a string of things to do, but have a function for re arranging that message
2011-03-18T00:14:20  <antimatroid> davidjliu: feel free to read my post here for why i think option 1 rules : http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1313&start=30
2011-03-18T00:14:26  <antimatroid> it's the second last post on that page :\ sorry
2011-03-18T00:15:47  <davidjliu> so, option 1 is just based on the number of enemies within a certain radius, right?
2011-03-18T00:15:57  <McLeopold> If we didn't do 2 bots each, then there might be very little attempt at bot to bot communication.  If we do, then everyone will want to attempt it, and it opens the door for spying.
2011-03-18T00:16:00  <davidjliu> I mean, I personally think it's better than just 1:1 killing as well, I think
2011-03-18T00:16:30  <antimatroid> it's awesome when you actually think about it compared to 1:1
2011-03-18T00:16:47  <sigh> it's also simpler to implement
2011-03-18T00:16:47  <davidjliu> I quite agree
2011-03-18T00:16:48  <McLeopold> Spying is a good thing.  If you make an incentive for everyone to attempt com, then it really becomes a fun game.
2011-03-18T00:16:54  <davidjliu> Although I still think 2 bots is super exciting
2011-03-18T00:17:03  <antimatroid> McLeopold: cooperation in this will come in the form of tit-for-tat for helping take out a mutual enemy
2011-03-18T00:17:15  <davidjliu> Spying as in, like, signal spying?
2011-03-18T00:17:28  <antimatroid> interpreting the message an ant is displaying
2011-03-18T00:17:35  <McLeopold> yes, but very few will try it unless they know they are going to attempt to communicate with themselves
2011-03-18T00:17:38  <antimatroid> like it might be a max size string
2011-03-18T00:17:38  <janzert> with severely limited sight radius and easily killing opponent ants spying is going to be almost non-existant no matter what
2011-03-18T00:17:49  <sigh> McLeopold: with themselves?
2011-03-18T00:17:53  <McLeopold> 2 bots gives you a reason to try com
2011-03-18T00:18:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: did you see these maps? http://pastebin.com/cgk3adBk
2011-03-18T00:18:17  <davidjliu> I think that with 2 players the way that "spying" would work is that your bot would start to give its signal when it encountered an enemy, and then you would get information from that
2011-03-18T00:18:19  <davidjliu> or something
2011-03-18T00:18:22  <antimatroid> done with a bunch of random walks carving through water
2011-03-18T00:18:56  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes, I really like them.  I'm also hoping my voronoi method makes the starter packs
2011-03-18T00:19:32  <antimatroid> i'm going to do a voronoi like asymmetric one at some point
2011-03-18T00:19:42  <antimatroid> davidjliu: what are your thoughts on using asymmetric maps?
2011-03-18T00:20:24  <McLeopold> antimatroid: for maze maps, do a random walk on the even integers and bias away from repeats
2011-03-18T00:20:49  <antimatroid> yeah i'll do that at some point
2011-03-18T00:20:59  <davidjliu> I mean, it seems to me like you could just take a smaller assymetric map and rotate it around 4 times and make a symetric map
2011-03-18T00:21:13  <antimatroid> davidjliu: what if you have more than 4 players?
2011-03-18T00:21:21  <davidjliu> hm
2011-03-18T00:21:39  <antimatroid> you can't have symmetric relative positions across all players with more than 3 players on a torus
2011-03-18T00:21:49  <antimatroid> just 2 on your normal grid
2011-03-18T00:21:53  <davidjliu> you could do that hexagonally as well, I imagine
2011-03-18T00:21:56  <antimatroid> at least with just 1 starting ant per player
2011-03-18T00:22:16  <antimatroid> yeah we considered that, you can even wrap that to form a torus but decided not to
2011-03-18T00:22:31  <davidjliu> are there going to be more than 4 players at a time?
2011-03-18T00:23:10  <antimatroid> hopefully
2011-03-18T00:23:24  <davidjliu> One of the issues I see is that if the game is between more than 4 players a lot of what determines how your bot does is its relative placement
2011-03-18T00:23:36  <davidjliu> (i.e. hopefully I get started near the sucky bot so I can kill it quickly, or something)
2011-03-18T00:23:40  <antimatroid> bots are ranked at the end of each game just off relative positions
2011-03-18T00:24:04  <antimatroid> just throw that on the pile of things we're saying are covered by number of games played
2011-03-18T00:24:18  <davidjliu> hm, evidently I've missed quite a bit over the last few weeks/month
2011-03-18T00:24:36  <antimatroid> i'm still iffy about the fact that your order rank isn't independent of your order of winning games
2011-03-18T00:25:06  <amstan> for the record, i got aerique push access so he can do changes easier
2011-03-18T00:25:10  <antimatroid> due to the pairing algorithm, but i have no solution for it
2011-03-18T00:26:09  <davidjliu> so, what are the major issues with having a 1v1 with to bots generated for each player?
2011-03-18T00:26:22  <davidjliu> other than the fact that it seems like a lot of work has been done in a different direction already
2011-03-18T00:26:23  <antimatroid> McLeopold: when was the last time you ran a game with battle option 1 going?
2011-03-18T00:26:32  <antimatroid> i'd be curious to hear what the speed difference was like
2011-03-18T00:27:02  <antimatroid> assuming a game has to play on the one server, that's 2 cores for all bots
2011-03-18T00:27:15  <McLeopold> a month or so
2011-03-18T00:27:30  <antimatroid> if you do 2 ants per player you need to have 3 ants per process in order to have more than 2 players
2011-03-18T00:27:37  <antimatroid> and good luck doing any more than that
2011-03-18T00:27:49  <sigh> the code was definetly broken for option 1 before I re-factored the other day
2011-03-18T00:28:05  <antimatroid> it's pretty easy to do 1 fairly efficiently
2011-03-18T00:28:05  <McLeopold> yeah, but that wasn't the code I tested on :)
2011-03-18T00:28:06  <sigh> it might stil be broken :P
2011-03-18T00:28:18  <sigh> ahhh
2011-03-18T00:28:20  <davidjliu> It would just be a 1v1 though
2011-03-18T00:28:20  <antimatroid> 2 i don't think one can
2011-03-18T00:28:43  <antimatroid> i'd be a little disappointed to move away from n-player now
2011-03-18T00:29:16  <antimatroid> we can do large games on tcp
2011-03-18T00:29:27  <antimatroid> oh yeah, add that to the launch checklist
2011-03-18T00:29:33  <McLeopold> I don't see how everyone thinks 26 players is feasable, and 6 players with 3 unique bots is not?  Do we not know math?
2011-03-18T00:29:54  <sigh> I don't know math
2011-03-18T00:29:56  <antimatroid> McLeopold: janzert reminded us yesterday that we've got a big problem there
2011-03-18T00:30:09  <McLeopold> a memory problem
2011-03-18T00:30:35  <antimatroid> you wouldn't run 13 bots on the one processor
2011-03-18T00:31:00  <McLeopold> yes we would
2011-03-18T00:31:05  <antimatroid> we could make it a team game?
2011-03-18T00:31:05  <McLeopold> serially
2011-03-18T00:31:19  <antimatroid> you actually know who is on your team, then you've got to try and work together to raise your score
2011-03-18T00:31:22  <amstan> sigh: so.. you don't have commit access?
2011-03-18T00:31:32  <sigh> amstan: no I don't
2011-03-18T00:31:41  <amstan> sigh: how did that happen? why didn't you yell?
2011-03-18T00:31:54  <antimatroid> he sighed :P
2011-03-18T00:31:57  <sigh> I don't know
2011-03-18T00:32:00  <amstan> lol
2011-03-18T00:32:01  <McLeopold> he was so productive without it
2011-03-18T00:32:23  <sigh> All my stuff goes through McLeopold anyway, because he acts as gatekeeper to the engine :P
2011-03-18T00:32:24  * janzert thinks a team game is more interesting than 2 instances of each players bot
2011-03-18T00:32:30  <McLeopold> does that mean I can stop mergine now?
2011-03-18T00:32:48  <amstan> McLeopold: maybe?
2011-03-18T00:32:51  * McLeopold thinks a team game is *way* less interesting that 2 instances
2011-03-18T00:32:55  <sigh> mergine?
2011-03-18T00:32:59  <antimatroid> i wouldn't mind 2 bots of each player if there were numerous players and you knew who your friends are
2011-03-18T00:33:07  <amstan> sigh: done
2011-03-18T00:33:22  <sigh> amstan: thanks
2011-03-18T00:33:31  <McLeopold> team play will never go over well
2011-03-18T00:33:41  <amstan> who else regularly commits?
2011-03-18T00:33:41  <McLeopold> unless you are your own team
2011-03-18T00:33:52  <amstan> bss03: want push access?
2011-03-18T00:33:53  <McLeopold> bss03?
2011-03-18T00:34:13  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, he does the matchmaking stuff
2011-03-18T00:34:21  <janzert> yes, I do prefer single instance 'deathmatch' over all the alternatives so far
2011-03-18T00:34:47  <McLeopold> sigh: so, it's official, you are now in charge of the engine
2011-03-18T00:35:21  <amstan> McLeopold: https://github.com/stephen-smith that's bss03
2011-03-18T00:35:26  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-18T00:35:34  <sigh> well, I'll do what I can... I won't have much time later though
2011-03-18T00:35:36  <McLeopold> I've been merging his stuff
2011-03-18T00:35:44  <amstan> should i give him commit access, did he use git properly?
2011-03-18T00:36:00  <McLeopold> I don't use git properly...
2011-03-18T00:36:08  <antimatroid> i'm still learning what the hell i'm doing with git
2011-03-18T00:36:08  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, but you have no choice
2011-03-18T00:36:41  <amstan> well.. you guys have it already
2011-03-18T00:36:53  <amstan> i'm just wondering the criteria for giving other ppl push access
2011-03-18T00:37:25  <antimatroid> do they also have push access to zeta?
2011-03-18T00:37:30  <amstan> yes
2011-03-18T00:39:30  <amstan> k, adding him, he seems like he knows his stuff
2011-03-18T00:39:30  <McLeopold> he doesn't do a lot of commits
2011-03-18T00:39:42  <amstan> McLeopold: or not? lol
2011-03-18T00:39:49  <McLeopold> yeah, add him
2011-03-18T00:39:52  <amstan> ok
2011-03-18T00:39:58  <amstan> but that's it, i'm going to bed after!
2011-03-18T00:40:12  <amstan> contestbot: later tell bss03 you can now push directly to the main repo
2011-03-18T00:40:12  <contestbot> amstan: Yes master!

2011-03-18T08:42:48  <Stocha> okay, i have an idea for a combat rule.
2011-03-18T08:43:16  <Stocha> Let an ant die with a probability of   number of ally/ 2x number of foes into its fighting radius.
2011-03-18T08:43:21  *** Frontier <Frontier!~marco@dslb-088-070-132-011.pools.arcor-ip.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-03-18T08:43:30  <Stocha> You'll have to build armies in order to be efficient this way.
2011-03-18T08:43:47  <Stocha> while single ants will still able to do some damage
2011-03-18T08:43:58  <Stocha> (to break blocking for exemple)
2011-03-18T08:44:24  <Stocha> It would bring tactical play into the game.
2011-03-18T08:45:28  <Stocha> that's probability of living , not dying, but well. you got the idea.
2011-03-18T08:46:13  <Stocha> anyone home ?
2011-03-18T08:49:08  <sigh_> Stocha: best to post on the forum
2011-03-18T08:49:16  <sigh_> this is not the most active time in the channel :P
2011-03-18T08:49:37  <Stocha> i did post it somewhere in the fighting thing thread i guess
2011-03-18T08:49:49  <Stocha> sometime it helps me get a clearer picture to type it in there :p
2011-03-18T08:50:14  <Stocha> What frightens me, is that the community seems to be lie 20 person at best.
2011-03-18T08:50:37  <Stocha> (we can see that in the poll on the forum. less that 20 votes)
2011-03-18T08:50:48  <Stocha> it's hard to guess what 5000 will be thinking :p
2011-03-18T08:50:50  <antimatroid> err what
2011-03-18T08:50:58  <antimatroid> you want to make battle resolution random?
2011-03-18T08:51:12  <Stocha> sure. But you would be afraid of it not being fair.
2011-03-18T08:51:21  <Stocha> i anticipated that. I do not agree :p
2011-03-18T08:51:42  <Naktibalda> what poll?
2011-03-18T08:51:55  <Stocha> the poll on the fighting 1 vs fighting 2
2011-03-18T08:51:59  <antimatroid> the very unofficial one over peoples preferences for battle resolution
2011-03-18T08:52:01  <Stocha> that's 18 participant i think.
2011-03-18T08:52:32  <Stocha> Either people chose neither options, or there are few people to poll from :p
2011-03-18T08:52:51  <Naktibalda> found it, haven't any opinion
2011-03-18T08:53:06  <antimatroid> Naktibalda: 1 is the most awesome thing ever
2011-03-18T08:53:07  <antimatroid> 2 is meh
2011-03-18T08:53:20  <antimatroid> better than sliced bread
2011-03-18T08:53:54  *** sigh_ is now known as sigh
2011-03-18T08:54:00  <Stocha> there should be a third choice : i want something else entirely :p
2011-03-18T08:54:04  <antimatroid> Stocah: what don't you like about option 1? it can't be difficulty given all the other ideas you ahve
2011-03-18T08:54:52  <Stocha> I have nothing against it. I don't feel anything for it. I can't make it work in my head. I didn't try to hard, to be fair.
2011-03-18T08:55:01  <Stocha> I doubt that is solves the spec though.
2011-03-18T08:55:12  <Stocha> "Have interesting tactical fight"
2011-03-18T08:55:25  <Stocha> I think i had a look at the pictures someone made
2011-03-18T08:55:40  <Stocha> death conditions and ratios, seemed wrong.
2011-03-18T08:55:51  <antimatroid> for each ant, count it's number of enemy ants within the attack radius, if any of those ants have less enemies in range of it than you do of you, your ant dies
2011-03-18T08:55:52  <Stocha> but i didn't stop to check if the diagram were correct or complete.
2011-03-18T08:56:07  <antimatroid> i made those pictures, they were for a smaller view radius
2011-03-18T08:56:18  <Stocha> Hasn't this rule been criticised as making blocking to easy ?
2011-03-18T08:56:28  <antimatroid> you can't fully block
2011-03-18T08:56:41  <antimatroid> you can defend certain things well, but that's a part of the game imo
2011-03-18T08:57:05  <antimatroid> you can fully block if attack radius is <2 i think
2011-03-18T08:57:07  <Stocha> Yeah, but the thing you can defend are like some ground pattern, that sound totally arbitrary things ?
2011-03-18T08:57:23  <antimatroid> say what?
2011-03-18T08:57:34  <Stocha> And you don't need to have huge packs of ant in order to be efficient
2011-03-18T08:57:45  <Stocha> i should have a look at those pictures again probably :p
2011-03-18T08:57:49  <antimatroid> did you see my example on the forums where the addition of an extra ant for 'a' causes them to lose both ants instead of none with option 2?
2011-03-18T08:57:54  <Stocha> Can you make one picture per rule ?
2011-03-18T08:58:02  <Stocha> or is it done by hand ?
2011-03-18T08:58:09  <antimatroid> i did those by hand :)
2011-03-18T08:58:17  <Stocha> oh.
2011-03-18T08:58:22  <antimatroid> each picture splites into 3
2011-03-18T08:58:35  <antimatroid> ignore the bottom one, then you have the results for option 1 and option 2
2011-03-18T08:58:48  <Stocha> Maybe i should try to build something to have a clear picture of what each rules does precisely :p
2011-03-18T08:58:54  <antimatroid> most people (including myself) had trouble understanding option 1 at first
2011-03-18T08:59:01  <antimatroid> but almost all of us have preferred it once we have
2011-03-18T08:59:29  <antimatroid> Stocha: work through those pictures on the forums, there are numbers there that you ought to be able to make sense of
2011-03-18T08:59:34  <Stocha> I think we really need some way of evaluating precisely the methods anyway .
2011-03-18T08:59:52  <Stocha> With different parameters etc.
2011-03-18T09:00:01  <antimatroid> the 1 numbers are the number of enemies for each ant, the second lot are the distances to the closest enemy (although with some of the more contrived examples with 2, you need to do a few iterations of removals of ants)
2011-03-18T09:00:08  <Stocha> so if it is fun enougth to do, i might build some script or something.
2011-03-18T09:00:20  <antimatroid> the engine supports both battle resolution methods for any attack radius
2011-03-18T09:00:29  <antimatroid> well, within reason
2011-03-18T09:00:37  <Stocha> the resolution is recursive ?
2011-03-18T09:00:43  <antimatroid> option 2 is
2011-03-18T09:00:50  <antimatroid> hence why i say it's less efficient
2011-03-18T09:00:54  <Stocha> but you advocate for option 1 ?
2011-03-18T09:01:10  <antimatroid> option 1 isn't recursive, you can do option 1 in a single sweep
2011-03-18T09:01:17  <Stocha> So let's say i should have a clear picture of what option 1 is about.
2011-03-18T09:01:38  <Stocha> I'll work on that before making any more arguments then :p
2011-03-18T09:02:11  <antimatroid> consider this example
2011-03-18T09:02:26  <antimatroid> ...a..b..c....
2011-03-18T09:02:42  <Stocha> i will work on it first. I really need to ponder a lot before i'm able to see if i agree with 1+1 =2 sometime :p
2011-03-18T09:02:47  <antimatroid> a and c have 1 enemy in range (b) while b has 2 enemies in range (a,c), so b dies
2011-03-18T09:02:55  <Stocha> but still i'm listening of course.
2011-03-18T09:02:56  <antimatroid> with option 2, all 3 die because they're all at an equal distance
2011-03-18T09:05:05  <antimatroid> does that make sense? otherwise what part don't you understand?
2011-03-18T09:05:16  <antimatroid> i'm fairly confident that once it clicks you will understand
2011-03-18T09:06:02  <antimatroid> (understand the rules, not necessarily my love for 1)

2011-03-18T10:29:01  <antimatroid> i think i could get tit for tat going in a game tree
2011-03-18T10:29:17  <antimatroid> problem is i would need other people to be doing something similar for it to payoff
2011-03-18T10:29:29  <antimatroid> hence needing to talk other people through doing it, as many as possible hehe
2011-03-18T10:30:39  <Stocha> i'm trying to implement rule 1 and rule 2
2011-03-18T10:31:37  <Stocha> I have made an auto scenario maker. It build a 20x10 ground map, and spawn randomly 10 opposite ant in each half. then ants walk either right or left depending on starting side.
2011-03-18T10:32:00  <Stocha> It's not ideal, but it should give some clue about how each rules work
2011-03-18T10:32:09  <Stocha> it would be a start at least.

2011-03-18T12:17:30  <Stocha> i added 1 vs many
2011-03-18T12:17:48  <Stocha> it shows that 1 vs many is always optimal for the one sending one.
2011-03-18T12:17:59  <Stocha> wich is evident when you think at it, but well.

2011-03-18T13:30:07  <Stocha> i posted an illustration of my random fight resolution for comparison with the rule1. Still in the exotic rule thread.
2011-03-18T13:30:25  <Stocha> If we need complex fighting i would rather go with this one i guess :p
2011-03-18T13:30:31  <Stocha> so far.
2011-03-18T13:30:46  <Stocha> at least, there will be reason to build up armies.
2011-03-18T13:30:59  <Stocha> wich i think was asked for.
2011-03-18T13:32:46  <amstan> so.. how's everyone?
2011-03-18T13:33:13  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@d61-117.icpnet.pl> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-03-18T13:33:45  <Stocha> ?
2011-03-18T13:34:04  <Stocha> fine. how are you ?
2011-03-18T13:38:10  <McLeopold> Stocha: to bring you up to speed, the reason we have 2 options for fighting is to emphasize 2 different parts of the game, micro (tactics) and macro (strategy)
2011-03-18T13:38:42  <McLeopold> Jeff, the guy in charge, wants fighting to be simple and understandable from a macro level.
2011-03-18T13:38:52  *** Zannick <Zannick!jokeserver@MAXIMEGALON.ANDREW.CMU.EDU> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-18T13:39:17  <McLeopold> Most of the serious programmers would rather the game emphasize the micro, tactical battles, which is harder to create good bots for.
2011-03-18T13:40:03  <Stocha> yeah, i need to test case option 2 also
2011-03-18T13:40:15  <McLeopold> As antimatroid said in this post, the easy, 1:1 kill ratio, macro options does not have good balance, which means there is no incentive to bunch ants together, just to spread them.
2011-03-18T13:40:19  <Stocha> lately i was told that option 1 was popular
2011-03-18T13:40:38  <janzert> I don't want to emphasize the micro I just want there to some interesting micro and more importantly some reason to not just spread your ants out
2011-03-18T13:40:59  <Stocha> Well my random rule achieves that
2011-03-18T13:41:08  <McLeopold> I agree, if we can provide incentive to bunch without micro, that would be the best option.
2011-03-18T13:41:09  <Stocha> you got very good reason to gather your ants then.
2011-03-18T13:41:21  <janzert> Stocha: so far as I know option 2 is much more popular
2011-03-18T13:41:21  <Stocha> still i need to test case option 2.
2011-03-18T13:41:34  <Stocha> okay, i'll have to test it anyway :p
2011-03-18T13:41:45  <McLeopold> Or at least prevent blocking.
2011-03-18T13:41:49  <Stocha> let's see if i can do that before diner
2011-03-18T13:41:59  <janzert> if I'm not getting the options confused again at least
2011-03-18T13:42:11  <McLeopold> Ant hit points would solve this, but that might be to complicated for Jeff's game goals.
2011-03-18T13:42:26  <McLeopold> janzert: call them, "closest" and "occupied"
2011-03-18T13:42:30  <Stocha> hit points and random fight shares some common properties
2011-03-18T13:42:45  <janzert> yeah, since jeff won't go for hit points I can't imagine him ever going for a random resolution
2011-03-18T13:42:48  <Stocha> wich one would be closest then ?
2011-03-18T13:42:56  <McLeopold> Stocha: also, we are fairly certain we want deterministic, so no random

2011-03-18T13:43:07  <Stocha> well hit point imply some state overload
2011-03-18T13:43:20  <Stocha> there is already a lot of randomness involved
2011-03-18T13:43:33  <Stocha> even in planet wars it was paramount
2011-03-18T13:43:46  <janzert> I take it back in the forum poll at least option 2 is the one jeff likes
2011-03-18T13:43:57  <Stocha> still, i'm there to test case, not to choose :p
2011-03-18T13:43:57  <janzert> and option 1 is the one most everyone else likes
2011-03-18T13:44:10  <janzert> I think
2011-03-18T13:44:20  <Stocha> but there were no real test case.
2011-03-18T13:44:39  <Stocha> at least now they can love/hate it on some hard evidences :p
2011-03-18T13:44:58  <janzert> I'd say there's been hard evidence floating around for weeks
2011-03-18T13:45:30  <Stocha> for me hard evidences mean having seen every possible situation in action :p
2011-03-18T13:45:35  <janzert> actually discussion had died down about it for the last week since it has been pretty much discussed out I think
2011-03-18T13:45:57  <Stocha> but no choice was made.
2011-03-18T13:46:12  <janzert> because no one empowered to make a choice is here
2011-03-18T13:46:13  <McLeopold> we are just waiting for the "closest" option to prove itself inadequate when we start to go live.
2011-03-18T13:46:14  <Stocha> not even hint of a choice. What did you put in the prototype ?

2011-03-18T13:46:38  <janzert> Jeff is BDFL and he's missing again
2011-03-18T13:46:41  <McLeopold> The current engine is using the closest method.
2011-03-18T13:46:52  <Stocha> rule 1
2011-03-18T13:47:08  <Stocha> aka : put ants in a grid.
2011-03-18T13:47:22  <Stocha> i call that radioactives ants.
2011-03-18T13:47:25  <janzert> also Jeff already sorta made the choice just we want to talk him out of it still
2011-03-18T13:47:45  <McLeopold> ok, but we give them a radioactive range of sqrt(5) right now
2011-03-18T13:47:49  <Stocha> why bother making a complex rule, if it just tell people to spread in fight
2011-03-18T13:48:14  <McLeopold> Stocha: the closest rule is very simple.
2011-03-18T13:48:19  <Stocha> jeff chose the method 2 ?
2011-03-18T13:48:36  <janzert> yes
2011-03-18T13:49:50  <Stocha> can someone explain rule 2 in plain french ? :p
2011-03-18T13:50:02  <Stocha> or in an intelligible way maybe :p
2011-03-18T13:50:03  <McLeopold> oui
2011-03-18T13:50:09  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-18T13:50:17  <janzert> have you seen the explinations in there?
2011-03-18T13:50:29  <Stocha> i did. But i forgot, let me check again
2011-03-18T13:50:41  <McLeopold> Look for enemy ants and distance 1, kill them all, then look for enemy ants at distance 2, kill them all, etc...
2011-03-18T13:51:01  <McLeopold> Up to the attack range, which is 5 right now.
2011-03-18T13:51:14  <Stocha> i fail to see the simplicity of it.
2011-03-18T13:51:42  <Stocha> sqrt is square root mcleopold
2011-03-18T13:51:52  <McLeopold> yes it is
2011-03-18T13:52:07  <Stocha> so one ant has the potential to kill many ?
2011-03-18T13:52:11  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-18T13:52:17  <Stocha> how is that different from rule 1 ?
2011-03-18T13:52:27  <McLeopold> what is rule 1?
2011-03-18T13:52:30  <Stocha> you will still have the launch ant after ant, with good spacing
2011-03-18T13:52:37  <Stocha> rule 2 i mean
2011-03-18T13:52:45  <McLeopold> what is rule 2?
2011-03-18T13:52:50  <Stocha> grrrr :'(
2011-03-18T13:53:18  <janzert> looking at the images you have for "rule1" I don't think it implements the option 1 we have
2011-03-18T13:53:30  <Stocha> oh
2011-03-18T13:53:37  <Stocha> maybe it is buggued. Or i got it wrong
2011-03-18T13:53:41  <Stocha> or both.
2011-03-18T13:54:08  <janzert> it's hard for me to figure it out with quick moving gif's though, I should download and examine frame by frame
2011-03-18T13:54:14  <McLeopold> Stocha: lets call you random rule, or rule 2, "probability"
2011-03-18T13:54:22  <Stocha> i think what i implemented was that wich i find in your specification
2011-03-18T13:54:30  <Stocha> though it could be buggued
2011-03-18T13:54:35  <Stocha> i used range 3 also.
2011-03-18T13:54:36  <janzert> but it'll be a bit before I have time to do that
2011-03-18T13:54:58  <McLeopold> Stocha: euclidean distance 3?  so sqrt(9)?
2011-03-18T13:55:05  <Stocha> or i can give you the java generator
2011-03-18T13:55:11  <Stocha> and you can view it on screen
2011-03-18T13:55:30  <janzert> maybe take antimatroid's hand done patterns and make sure you get the same resolution?
2011-03-18T13:55:35  <Stocha> provided you can do some java i guess. There is no easy config right now.
2011-03-18T13:56:03  <McLeopold> Stocha: something else to consider, we've noticed that random food placement does make a huge difference to the outcome of the game.  So simple random isn't going to cut it.
2011-03-18T13:56:11  <Stocha> i'd rather you to check the gif then :p
2011-03-18T13:56:17  <Stocha> i can give you more material if you need.
2011-03-18T13:57:00  <Stocha> McLeopold : does that mean that the strongest bots will not be ranked strongest if the food placement is random ?
2011-03-18T13:57:07  <janzert> I'll try and check it in an image editor a little later unless you find a problem first
2011-03-18T13:57:10  <Stocha> because that is what we care about i think.
2011-03-18T13:57:37  <Stocha> i don't think i'll dig in it too much. i really don't find those rules anyfun.
2011-03-18T13:57:43  <Stocha> they certainly are not trivial
2011-03-18T13:57:53  <Stocha> well the random is the worst for testing purpose i guess :p
2011-03-18T13:58:08  <Stocha> so i would advocate against random fight for that. too hard to test :p
2011-03-18T13:58:26  <Stocha> unless we provide some test case or something.
2011-03-18T13:59:24  <Stocha> the problem i see with those gif, is that analysing them is tedious
2011-03-18T13:59:35  <Stocha> there ought to be a better way :p
2011-03-18T13:59:45  <McLeopold> Stocha: it means that identical bots don't draw
2011-03-18T14:00:02  <Stocha> How could they draw anyway.
2011-03-18T14:00:12  <Stocha> there will always be some randomness in there.
2011-03-18T14:00:21  <Stocha> draw is unlikely.
2011-03-18T14:00:25  <McLeopold> They should at least expand at the same rate and hold similar territories for awhile
2011-03-18T14:00:33  <Stocha> why ?
2011-03-18T14:00:39  <McLeopold> Because they are identical
2011-03-18T14:00:49  <Stocha> they should play good if they are strong, that's it.
2011-03-18T14:00:55  <janzert> ok, yeah I don't need to load the gifs in an editor
2011-03-18T14:01:00  <Stocha> and be ranked at some comparable levels.
2011-03-18T14:01:07  <McLeopold> I'm talking about how random food affects bots, not bot strength
2011-03-18T14:01:10  <Stocha> janzert ?
2011-03-18T14:01:35  <janzert> looking at the bottom rule1 illustration with many versus 1 the 1 ant should never be able to kill 2 ants that are adjacent to each other
2011-03-18T14:01:35  <Stocha> yeah, but there will be randomness. And same bot will never draw anyway.

2011-03-18T14:01:56  <McLeopold> But the unbalance with random food is to great.
2011-03-18T14:02:06  <Stocha> how do you prove that ?
2011-03-18T14:02:08  <janzert> or any ant that has another friendly ant in range that is
2011-03-18T14:02:18  <Stocha> janzert okay ...
2011-03-18T14:02:28  <Stocha> let me try to understand the rule then :'(
2011-03-18T14:02:49  <McLeopold> Stocha: many sample games and observing the results, I don't have proof to show.
2011-03-18T14:03:09  <Stocha> that's some kind of evidence though.
2011-03-18T14:03:24  <McLeopold> You can download the engine and example bots and see for yourself.
2011-03-18T14:03:31  <Stocha> what would be cool, would be if anyone could reuse whatever you used ton convince yourself
2011-03-18T14:03:43  <Stocha> well i have an engine also
2011-03-18T14:03:52  <Stocha> food gathering is not that different.
2011-03-18T14:04:06  <Stocha> but i have no bot good enougth to conclude anything yet :p

2011-03-18T14:04:29  <Stocha> i planned on building a hunter seeker, and see how he fars against random bots.
2011-03-18T14:04:41  <Stocha> but i doubt the random bot will get a chance at winning .
2011-03-18T14:05:58  <McLeopold> Stocha: I'm attempting to enlighten you with everything the group has learned in the last 2 months.  You seem to want to start over?
2011-03-18T14:07:12  <Stocha> i wouldn't put it this way. But i have a way of learning that make me needing to see by myself. although i can learn by listening. I will have to confront at some point.
2011-03-18T14:07:27  <janzert> so option 1, rule 1 I think I'll call the "overloaded" rule :)
2011-03-18T14:07:33  <Stocha> that's why i like illustrations.
2011-03-18T14:07:38  <janzert> and overloaded ants die

2011-03-18T14:07:54  <janzert> or maybe over-powered is better
2011-03-18T14:07:59  <McLeopold> janzert: you mean what antimatroid calls option 1?
2011-03-18T14:08:03  <janzert> yes
2011-03-18T14:08:20  <Stocha> so no two ant the same distance of one alone ennemy can die the same turn right ?
2011-03-18T14:08:37  <janzert> the same distance from each other
2011-03-18T14:08:42  <Stocha> attle Option 1: First count up how many enemies each ant has around them within the battle radius
2011-03-18T14:08:48  <McLeopold> but for a single ant, nearby enemy ants may not participate, and it only take 1 ant to kill another, so it's kind of a misnomer
2011-03-18T14:08:52  <Stocha> rule 1 : is what the spec calls options 1 right ?
2011-03-18T14:08:59  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-18T14:09:30  <Stocha> let's me check what i do
2011-03-18T14:09:31  <McLeopold> Stocha: may I suggest using the official engine for your tests?  Do you know python?
2011-03-18T14:09:34  <Stocha> (or what i think i do)
2011-03-18T14:09:37  <janzert> over-powered is from the perspective of the individual ant
2011-03-18T14:09:42  <Stocha> i only java :'(
2011-03-18T14:09:48  <Stocha> that's why i wrote a java engine
2011-03-18T14:10:02  <Stocha> that and i probably will need whenever i try to build a serious bot
2011-03-18T14:10:31  <Stocha> java is good and flexible.
2011-03-18T14:10:33  <Stocha> for testing.
2011-03-18T14:10:43  <Stocha> fast also
2011-03-18T14:10:45  <McLeopold> Do you have it on github or similar?  I can review it to make sure it comforms to the official.
2011-03-18T14:11:38  <janzert> java is flexible when the comparison is to python? :P
2011-03-18T14:12:04  <McLeopold> janzert: for overpowered/occupied, a single ant can have 3 enemies nearby, but survive, and another can can have 1 enemy nearby and die.
2011-03-18T14:12:36  <Stocha> i think that would be a good idea mcleopold; Unfortunately i never used git hub and such.
2011-03-18T14:12:56  <McLeopold> svn? git? hg? bazzar?
2011-03-18T14:12:59  <Stocha> i would probably make the code clearer if i'm to be rewiewed :p
2011-03-18T14:13:03  <janzert> yeah, hmm overpowered is still a bad name
2011-03-18T14:13:20  <Stocha> i used svn in the past. but for some time i have been using no version control :p
2011-03-18T14:13:24  <McLeopold> occupied was to describe who can kill you, not if you die
2011-03-18T14:13:41  <McLeopold> Stocha: get git! we can add you to the team
2011-03-18T14:13:47  <Stocha> well, let me at least try to explain what i think i do
2011-03-18T14:13:53  <Stocha> they we can later check the code :p
2011-03-18T14:14:12  <Stocha> so : i give a point to each ant, for any ennemy in the fight radius.
2011-03-18T14:14:26  <Stocha> let's call that P(a)
2011-03-18T14:14:31  <Stocha> where P is the counting
2011-03-18T14:14:34  <Stocha> and a is the ant
2011-03-18T14:15:24  <Stocha> then it dies if it exists an eneme b such tat
2011-03-18T14:15:34  <Stocha> P(a) >= P(b)
2011-03-18T14:15:40  <Stocha> that's about it
2011-03-18T14:15:50  <Stocha> (b is in the fight radius of a also)
2011-03-18T14:16:13  <Stocha> does that sound okay ?
2011-03-18T14:16:40  <McLeopold> Yes, that's the "occupied" method.
2011-03-18T14:16:48  * janzert nods
2011-03-18T14:16:50  <Stocha> that is option 1 right ?
2011-03-18T14:16:52  <janzert> seems right
2011-03-18T14:17:00  <McLeopold> there is no option 1, only "occupied"
2011-03-18T14:17:05  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-18T14:17:10  <Stocha> i could well have bugs; My code is a bit messy :p
2011-03-18T14:17:17  <Stocha> change the spec then :p
2011-03-18T14:17:25  <Stocha> i need some official paper somewhere to refer to !
2011-03-18T14:17:39  <McLeopold> Stocha: I'd like for a java engine to be part of the toolset.  If you have a good start on it, we could add it to the repo.
2011-03-18T14:18:04  <Stocha> okay. in the worst case, i'll just send you the code. i guess
2011-03-18T14:18:17  <Stocha> but it would need some optimization also
2011-03-18T14:18:23  <McLeopold> so, you don't want to use version control?
2011-03-18T14:18:27  <Stocha> i mean i build it around optimization that i did not do :p
2011-03-18T14:18:40  <Stocha> i'm not used to that's all
2011-03-18T14:18:44  <Stocha> i'll come to it slowly
2011-03-18T14:18:59  <janzert> ok in Rule1_corridor20_vs1.gif
2011-03-18T14:19:01  <Stocha> but i want to make sure that i spend more time writing code that using version control :p
2011-03-18T14:19:07  <janzert> on frame 192
2011-03-18T14:19:10  <McLeopold> Stocha: mac, *nix or windows?
2011-03-18T14:19:19  <Stocha> right now i'm on max os x
2011-03-18T14:19:23  <Stocha> with netbeans
2011-03-18T14:19:44  <Stocha> i used to be on ubuntu, but that was long ago.
2011-03-18T14:19:45  <McLeopold> so, git should be easy to install
2011-03-18T14:19:57  <Stocha> as a plugin for netbeans ?
2011-03-18T14:20:00  <McLeopold> when you are ready, let me know
2011-03-18T14:20:10  <Stocha> i will, thanks :p
2011-03-18T14:20:27  <Stocha> i a few days i guess. if i keep my mind interested in the challenge; Wich i hope i will.
2011-03-18T14:20:30  <McLeopold> I use eclipse, but EGit hasn't been kind to me, so I stick with command line.
2011-03-18T14:20:40  <Stocha> i'd like to try to win some competition of some sort :p
2011-03-18T14:20:41  <janzert> the 1 has 3 enemy in range each of those have 1 enemy in range so the 1 should have a P(a)=3 right and the 3 a P(a)=1 and the 1 only should die instead of all of them dieing in frame 193
2011-03-18T14:20:59  <McLeopold> http://nbgit.org/
2011-03-18T14:21:52  <janzert> same at frame 184-185
2011-03-18T14:22:00  <Stocha> yeah there is a bug then.
2011-03-18T14:22:11  <Stocha> i'll suppress the offending pictures for now :p
2011-03-18T14:23:11  <McLeopold> Stocha: you're random rules doesn't seem right.  1 - (allies / (2 * enemies) )
2011-03-18T14:23:22  <McLeopold> or is it 1 - (allies/2 * enemies)?
2011-03-18T14:23:50  <Stocha> ?
2011-03-18T14:24:18  <Stocha> 1 - (friendly in range / 2 * ennemy in range) it is
2011-03-18T14:24:37  <Stocha> then you die.
2011-03-18T14:24:46  <Stocha> i could check the code also
2011-03-18T14:25:16  <Stocha> it is likely to suffer the same bug as the other
2011-03-18T14:25:23  <Stocha> i should probably put them off also.
2011-03-18T14:25:28  <McLeopold> so, you have a 100% chance of dying with no ants in sight?
2011-03-18T14:25:32  <Stocha> until i have things settled
2011-03-18T14:26:07  <Stocha> no
2011-03-18T14:26:08  <McLeopold> 1-(0/2*0) = 1

2011-03-18T15:13:10  <janzert> yeah, there are probably arguments for either direction. I don't really have a strong feeling either way.
2011-03-18T15:14:30  <janzert> I guess I lean toward starting with just going by submission first since it's a strict subset of the other
2011-03-18T15:14:41  <janzert> then if problems crop up we can expand it
2011-03-18T15:31:13  <Frontier> McLeopold: Did you look at the bug by the way? I haven't checked recently.

2011-03-18T16:20:46  <Stocha> to build some frenchip, before going into the wild
2011-03-18T16:20:50  <Stocha> or something
2011-03-18T16:21:05  <Stocha> i'll probably need lots of help too in order to source control
2011-03-18T16:21:31  <Stocha> so it's better if i think that the code is worth sharing firstable.

2011-03-18T19:15:55  <McLeopold> If a bot with mu 25 is going to be paired with 1 of 5 potential bots all with mu 25 as well, TrueSkill would pick the bot with the smallest sigma, no?

2011-03-18T19:17:06  <McLeopold> so, in general, once we have a seed player, the other bots will be submissions that have played a bunch and are well established in the rankings
2011-03-18T19:17:56  <McLeopold> that also means, new submission will hardly ever play each other

2011-03-18T19:39:02  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: that might be the case, but i don't think it's a bad thing
2011-03-18T19:39:38  <jmcarthur> pitting new submissions against well-established bots means that your rank will converge much more quickly, and that's what you really care about
2011-03-18T19:40:19  <jmcarthur> also, it should be a probabilistic matching algorithm, shouldn't it?
2011-03-18T19:40:35  <jmcarthur> like, each of those five bots gets a weight based on their sigma
2011-03-18T19:40:48  <jmcarthur> so it won't *always* pick the smallest sigma
2011-03-18T19:40:56  <McLeopold> we get a match quality number, but we still need our own method of picking the opponents
2011-03-18T19:41:02  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-18T19:41:12  <jmcarthur> well, i think it should be probabilistic based on match quality, then :)
2011-03-18T19:41:33  <McLeopold> right now, the pool of available bots is limited with a few "no repeat" rules, but that is it
2011-03-18T19:41:35  <jmcarthur> s/based on/weighted by/
2011-03-18T19:42:00  <jmcarthur> i'm afraid of arbitrary constraints. i'd prefer they be probabilistic as well, personally
2011-03-18T19:42:28  <McLeopold> that makes the calc a little harder, but I agree
2011-03-18T19:42:32  <jmcarthur> like... match quality could be lowered (perhaps significantly) by repeats
2011-03-18T19:43:14  <McLeopold> I'd like a hard no repeat rule.  We can tune how many games that is.
2011-03-18T19:45:16  <McLeopold> I'm just thinking that 2 new submissions will never play each other until they become the oldest ones
2011-03-18T19:45:23  <McLeopold> Maybe that isn't so bad.
2011-03-18T19:46:40  <McLeopold> I'm assuming sigma is a very good approximation of submission age.

2011-03-18T21:10:42  <antimatroid> the best way to count ants < distance is to hash all the translate amounts and check each location, for varying radius, i'd probably just paint outwards, although you might be able to speed it up a bit by spiralling outwards and not checking squares again all the time.
2011-03-18T21:10:56  <antimatroid> i very much abuse the word hash

2011-03-18T21:32:44  <_flag> Is there a way to spawn food symmetrically with the engine yet or no?
2011-03-18T21:40:49  <sigh> _flag: yes, set --food symmetric
2011-03-18T21:41:12  <sigh> it's not default because it can only work with maps generated by antimatroid's symmetric map gen
2011-03-18T21:42:20  <antimatroid> it's not doing it the way i desbribe in the forums, but it's symmetric for the moment
2011-03-18T21:42:56  <antimatroid> i shall clean my map gen up later and have it capable of doing random and random walk symmetric maps, then i'll start doing the asymmetric one that trys to throw out fair maps
2011-03-18T21:43:05  <sigh> antimatroid: is there a consensus yet on what the actual functionality is yet?
2011-03-18T21:43:18  <antimatroid> what functionality?
2011-03-18T21:43:19  <sigh> in terms of choosing which set to put food in
2011-03-18T21:43:39  <antimatroid> for asymmetric?
2011-03-18T21:43:47  <sigh> for symmetric
2011-03-18T21:44:30  <antimatroid> you're just repeatedly picking a square from your basis untill all it's spanned elements are free yeah?
2011-03-18T21:45:05  <antimatroid> i think a better alternative would be to just store the counter for how many pieces of land are waiting to spawn somewhere and see how much it builds up
2011-03-18T21:45:32  <antimatroid> i think asymmetric should be done somewhat similarly, but find each players starting closest squares then spawn 1 food square for each set each turn
2011-03-18T21:45:43  <antimatroid> i'm planning to do asymmetric maps like that with water placement
2011-03-18T21:46:16  <antimatroid> also, greentea has provided the clearest explanation of option 1 so far
2011-03-18T21:46:34  <antimatroid> "Lets define conception: ant Power = 1/numOpponents. 
2011-03-18T21:46:34  <antimatroid> Then first rule can be rewriten as:
2011-03-18T21:46:34  <antimatroid> Ant alive if its Power is greater than Power of any of his opponents. 
2011-03-18T21:46:34  <antimatroid> Or by another words: Ant dies if it has at least one most or equal Powerful opponent."
2011-03-18T21:46:49  <sigh> the only problem with that resolution is that it will constantly keep trying and rejects a bunch of places before it finds one free
2011-03-18T21:47:08  <sigh> because, by definition, the places at the front of the queue are not free very often
2011-03-18T21:47:22  <antimatroid> sigh: it also introduces the notion of stratigically placing your ants to mix with the spawning
2011-03-18T21:47:44  <antimatroid> which i doubt anyone could successfully manipulate, but i'd rather avoid anyway
2011-03-18T21:47:55  <sigh> it tells you that if an ant stays still long enough then there is an increased chance that a food will spawn there when they move off it
2011-03-18T21:48:17  <antimatroid> only because you took too long to move and get what you would have already got
2011-03-18T21:48:24  <antimatroid> i don't think you can manipulate that in your favour
2011-03-18T21:48:46  <antimatroid> whereas the converse allows you to position your ants to try and not let enemies get food spawned in a good location elsewhere
2011-03-18T21:48:57  <antimatroid> near impossible to exploit, but the problem presents itself nonetheless
2011-03-18T21:49:04  <sigh> you can do that anyway?
2011-03-18T21:49:22  <antimatroid> not if you don't pick other squares on a collision
2011-03-18T21:49:22  <sigh> because food will never spawn if you are blocking one of the squares in teh set
2011-03-18T21:49:27  <antimatroid> you just wait to spawn on a square
2011-03-18T21:49:40  <antimatroid> yes, but that's hurting you, not someone somewhere else on the maop
2011-03-18T21:50:09  <antimatroid> does that make sense?
2011-03-18T21:50:30  <sigh> ok, I think I don't understand what you want
2011-03-18T21:50:37  <antimatroid> ?
2011-03-18T21:50:41  <sigh> what is the counter counting, how do you choose what food to spawn
2011-03-18T21:51:50  <antimatroid> each square has a counter with the number of land squares waiting to spawn, all starting at 0. When you go to spawn food, pick a square inside your basis set, then increment each of the square counters to spawn food, then actually go and spawn food for every square not containing food/an ant decrement the counter and spawn food
2011-03-18T21:51:59  <antimatroid> food squares* waiting to spawn
2011-03-18T21:52:33  <antimatroid> whereas now you're picking a square, checking to see if they're empty, then moving on if one isn't
2011-03-18T21:53:15  <antimatroid> if you move on, your ant position affected the spawning of food somewhere else in the map, whereas with this other method, it only affects the spawning of food right there where you are, which you don't want to block if possible
2011-03-18T21:54:45  <antimatroid> does that make sense now?
2011-03-18T21:54:53  <sigh> what does the counter do?
2011-03-18T21:55:08  <antimatroid> you use the counter when you actually go to spawn food

2011-03-18T21:55:16  <antimatroid> you don't actually spawn any food when you pick out your squares
2011-03-18T21:55:50  <antimatroid> to speed things up, you can store a queue of squares with a positive counter, then spawn from that each turn, only readding the square if the counter is still positive after decrementing it
2011-03-18T21:56:23  <antimatroid> (so as to not go through the entire grid looking for squares with a positive counter)

2011-03-18T21:57:36  <antimatroid> no, if the counter is 2, you add a food square, decrement the counter and add the square to the end of the queue, if it is 1, you spawn a food square, decrement the counter and don't add the square back to the queue
2011-03-18T21:58:07  <antimatroid> so when you pick out new squares to spawn food on, you just increment the counter on each square, then go and spawn food for squares waiting to spawn food on
2011-03-18T21:58:19  <sigh> hmmm... so you effectivly have multiple food on a single square?
2011-03-18T21:58:22  <antimatroid> hopefully the counters very rarely go above 2, but it's there to handle extra amounts
2011-03-18T21:58:32  <antimatroid> no, you're waiting for multiple food squares to spawn there
2011-03-18T21:58:48  <antimatroid> i don't expect to flood the maps that collisions start happening all the time
2011-03-18T21:58:58  <antimatroid> but it's there to avoid the issues i talked about with the current method
2011-03-18T21:59:17  <sigh> if the counter is 10, then you can get ten ants out of it by spawning and moving out of the way?
2011-03-18T21:59:36  <antimatroid> yes, but i don't expect the counter to ever get to 10
2011-03-18T21:59:49  <antimatroid> unless you stupidly stood on square that you could have had ants long ago from
2011-03-18T22:00:30  <antimatroid> i would repeatedly order the basis squares (don't repeatedly use the same ordering) so as to make sure each square gets a somewhat fair distribution amount each game and we minimise these large counter values
2011-03-18T22:01:26  <antimatroid> i don't need you to actually implement this right now, but it'd be good if you were with on board with my thought process

2011-03-18T22:36:10  <_flag> antimatroid: can I have a link to those new maps you made? The map gen seems to still generate the more random-looking ones.
2011-03-18T22:42:45  <sigh> man, this is annoying to test... the bots behave different based on what order I tell them about the food on a given turn
2011-03-18T22:42:55  <sigh> so I can't just run diff on the output -_-
2011-03-18T22:45:03  <sigh> either way, using a dictionary has negligible impact on the runtime
2011-03-18T22:48:48  <sigh> @later tell antimatroid I made it so that it no longer iterates over a grid: https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge/blob/symmetric-food/ants/ants.py#L631 anyway try it out and tell me and if you are happy with the functionality I will merge it in
2011-03-18T22:48:48  <contestbot> sigh: Aye, aye, sir

2011-03-18T23:28:13  <jmcarthur> "<Stocha> is there a clever way to count all ennemy at distance < DIST for each friendly ant ?"   <-- best i can think of is something like a quad tree, but i'm not even sure we'll have enough ants that it would even be worth its own overhead. unless you're talking about very large distances, it'd probably be best to just query all the points within a circle.
2011-03-18T23:28:43  <jmcarthur> i don't have anything really clever in mind, at least
2011-03-18T23:29:19  <sigh> yeah, I was having a think about that as well, and just doing a dumb search seems best
2011-03-18T23:30:29  <sigh> the current code just tests each point inside the bounding square of the vision circle
2011-03-18T23:30:33  <jmcarthur> there would be a pretty efficient way to do it with manhattan distance, i bet, but euclidean is a little tougher
2011-03-18T23:31:08  <sigh> euclidean distance is not that much worse, 2 more multiplications per iteration
2011-03-18T23:31:13  <jmcarthur> oh i wasn't thinking manhattan. i was thinking.... what's it called.... the one where distance = dx + dy
2011-03-18T23:31:23  <sigh> that is manhatten
2011-03-18T23:31:28  <jmcarthur> err
2011-03-18T23:31:41  <jmcarthur> max(dx,dy)
2011-03-18T23:31:45  <jmcarthur> *min
2011-03-18T23:31:47  <jmcarthur> gah
2011-03-18T23:31:50  <jmcarthur> min(dx,dy)
2011-03-18T23:31:51  <sigh> oh, that is something else
2011-03-18T23:31:58  <jmcarthur> i just suck
2011-03-18T23:32:31  <jmcarthur> but anyway, with that one at least, i can envision a simple sliding-window sort of thing... i bet that could actually be adapted to other distance measures with some work, actually
2011-03-18T23:32:53  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-18T23:33:26  <sigh> you just precompute the values inside the bounding box
2011-03-18T23:33:30  <jmcarthur> but it would possibly be able to save some work querying locations over and over
2011-03-18T23:34:09  <jmcarthur> only if your ants are fairly dense though
2011-03-18T23:34:13  <sigh> only problem is that the current code requires calculation of different radiuses
2011-03-18T23:34:57  <sigh> anyway, I'm leaving optimisation until the specs are down
2011-03-18T23:35:06  <jmcarthur> yeah i'm not worrying about this sort of thing
2011-03-18T23:36:26  <sigh> well it is important, just not right now
2011-03-18T23:37:11  <McLeopold> just add memoization to your count function, and clear all results between turns
2011-03-18T23:37:39  <sigh> McLeopold: what count function?
2011-03-18T23:37:57  <McLeopold> enemies in range
2011-03-18T23:38:11  <jmcarthur> i'm assuming we are talking some function that gives you a mapping from your ants to the number of enemies within range
2011-03-18T23:38:14  <McLeopold> or you can calc the whole grid first
2011-03-18T23:38:18  <jmcarthur> right
2011-03-18T23:38:22  <jmcarthur> that's the pass we're discussing
2011-03-18T23:38:36  <jmcarthur> i bet there is a way to do it without having to consider it fresh for each ant
2011-03-18T23:38:46  <sigh> yeah, using a memoising decorator that has to be rest is annoying
2011-03-18T23:38:49  <jmcarthur> at least if your ants are kind of dense
2011-03-18T23:39:16  <sigh> you can just consider ants that move, but I expect most of them move
2011-03-18T23:39:24  <McLeopold> you could use bit maps and population counts
2011-03-18T23:39:44  <jmcarthur> yeah that provides a little compression
2011-03-18T23:41:25  <jmcarthur> actually i bet the quad tree approach might be reasonable
2011-03-18T23:42:14  <sigh> quad tree performance does have degenerate cases for nearest neighbour, I think
2011-03-18T23:42:35  <sigh> oh, duh
2011-03-18T23:42:44  <jmcarthur> this isn't nearest neighbor :)
2011-03-18T23:42:45  <sigh> we don't want nearest or k-nearest
2011-03-18T23:42:49  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-18T23:43:21  <sigh> worth trying, but I'd bet against it
2011-03-18T23:43:27  <jmcarthur> quad tree would be a lot nicer if we only cared about a bounding box
2011-03-18T23:43:32  <jmcarthur> not as nice for euclidean
2011-03-18T23:43:40  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-18T23:46:00  <sigh> instead of quad tree you could partition into explicit subgrids
2011-03-18T23:46:11  <jmcarthur> ?

2011-03-18T23:47:49  <sigh> each section lists the ants inside and you do an explicit check against ants in neighbouring sections
2011-03-18T23:47:49  <jmcarthur> i intended to imply that the quad tree was balanced by map dimensions, not by number of ants, if that's what you're getting at
2011-03-18T23:48:32  <sigh> well then, why put it in a tree? won't all leaves be the same size?
2011-03-18T23:48:41  <sigh> so it is just a grid
2011-03-18T23:48:46  <jmcarthur> the same dimension, yes, but not the same ant counts

2011-03-18T23:49:06  <Stocha> damn i probably missed part of the conversation :p
2011-03-18T23:49:14  <Stocha> i use bit maps for my part
2011-03-18T23:49:16  <jmcarthur> you'd be able to count the number of ants in a particular (rectangular) area more efficiently
2011-03-18T23:49:29  <Stocha> that will probably be okay with the so called method 1 of dying ants.
2011-03-18T23:49:39  <Stocha> although it is still unsatifying i guess
2011-03-18T23:49:56  <sigh> Stocha: see topic for logs
2011-03-18T23:50:05  <Stocha> there is a fun trick with rotating the bit maps
2011-03-18T23:50:10  <Stocha> topics ?
2011-03-18T23:50:17  <Stocha> i'm on the web client
2011-03-18T23:50:21  <Stocha> where is topi ?
2011-03-18T23:50:27  <Stocha> ah channel logs
2011-03-18T23:50:45  <sigh> you said you missed part of the conversation :P
2011-03-18T23:51:20  <sigh> jmcarthur: yeah, that's the problem as soon as you move away from rectangular, you have to do some computation anyway
2011-03-18T23:51:52  <Stocha> okay that log things is usefull. i will stop saying junk when nobody i there then also :p
2011-03-18T23:52:23  <Stocha> the bit rotation is usefull
2011-03-18T23:52:41  <Stocha> i use bit maps and bit rotations for painting the disk radius
2011-03-18T23:52:44  <sigh> what's this trick with rotating bitmaps?
2011-03-18T23:52:50  <sigh> oh i see
2011-03-18T23:52:52  <Stocha> then i AND that with ennemy mp
2011-03-18T23:52:54  <Stocha> map
2011-03-18T23:53:06  <Stocha> i do not know for sure if it is faster though
2011-03-18T23:53:10  <sigh> yeah, i see
2011-03-18T23:53:10  <Stocha> but it sure is cool :p
2011-03-18T23:53:28  <Stocha> the neat thing is that you can paint multiple disk at once
2011-03-18T23:53:44  <Stocha> that would be faster for sighting calculation for example
2011-03-18T23:54:06  <Stocha> although i doesn't really help for counting ennemies :'(
2011-03-18T23:54:14  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-18T23:54:29  <Stocha> i don't like those fighting method, to slow :p
2011-03-18T23:54:47  <Stocha> i didn't try method 2 yet
2011-03-18T23:55:06  <Stocha> i guess you could simply precompute the shape for each sub distance
2011-03-18T23:55:19  <sigh> yeah, we were talking about that
2011-03-18T23:56:05  <Stocha> i don't really see what they bring over the simple ant dies in same square.
2011-03-18T23:57:23  <sigh> well, that will happen anyway if there is no battle resolution at all
2011-03-18T23:57:55  <Stocha> with method 1 "blocking" seems possible
2011-03-18T23:58:00  <Stocha> isn't it ?
2011-03-18T23:58:11  <Stocha> or did i do something wrong again :p
2011-03-18T23:58:23  <sigh> what do you mean by blocking?
2011-03-18T23:58:25  <Stocha> i'll post some more .gif in order to be proof readed i guess :p
2011-03-18T23:58:42  <Stocha> i mean puting some ant still and the opponent not be able to get through
2011-03-18T23:58:53  <Stocha> it happens if many can kill one.
2011-03-18T23:59:05  <Stocha> then you can find some map where you can block
