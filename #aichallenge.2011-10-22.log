2011-10-22T00:00:14  <ChrisH_> ls1024: looks like you need to work on keeping your ants from  colliding with each other.
2011-10-22T00:01:05  <ls1024> ChrisH_: There's a lot I need to fix here.
2011-10-22T00:01:30  <Fluxid> my ants collide too, sometimes
2011-10-22T00:01:47  <ChrisH_> ls1024: and once you fix them, there will be the next thing to improve. :)
2011-10-22T00:01:54  <bobbydroptable> ls1024 lol love the suicides
2011-10-22T00:02:02  <ChrisH_> ls1024: and then one more.  ;)
2011-10-22T00:02:20  <AndrewBC> hmmm, occasional invalids due to not realize food is blocking collideable

2011-10-22T00:04:25  <ash0d> good luck
2011-10-22T00:04:43  <Fluxid> do you specialize your ants?
2011-10-22T00:04:50  <ChrisH_> ls1024 is hooked.
2011-10-22T00:05:09  <bobbydroptable> who wouldn't be
2011-10-22T00:05:10  <ls1024> So much for getting any sleep this weekend.
2011-10-22T00:05:24  <ChrisH_> or the next two months
2011-10-22T00:05:28  <Fluxid> for example, ones are more food gatherers than anything else, other are explorers and other are hill razers?
2011-10-22T00:06:16  <bobbydroptable> Fluxid: I've thought about that, but I've found it incredibly difficult to micro individual ants
2011-10-22T00:06:22  <ChrisH_> Fluxid: I don't. I let the ants do whatever task they are closest to, but presently there are some priorities to those tasks based on the situation.
2011-10-22T00:06:54  <Fluxid> or do you implement some logic to divide groups, so instead of one huge group going to ine enemy hill, it divides into two groups to attack two different hills
2011-10-22T00:06:56  <ChrisH_> but an ant is an ant, so they can change tasks between turns if needed
2011-10-22T00:07:27  <bobbydroptable> my 2nd bot is aiming to make it more globally goal oriented
2011-10-22T00:07:28  <Fluxid> bobbydroptable: i implemented state for each ant, and i keep track of them, but i wonder how far i can push it
2011-10-22T00:07:30  <ChrisH_> yeah, I do that by putting a number of ants needed to accomplish a task.
2011-10-22T00:07:43  <Fluxid> i have now explorers, food gatherers and hill attackers

2011-10-22T00:07:56  <bobbydroptable> so my "hive" defines what the targets are, and the ants decide which to go for using heuristics

2011-10-22T00:11:07  <bobbydroptable> and the ants decide amongst themselves what to do
2011-10-22T00:11:31  <ls1024> bobbydroptable has invented scentient ants.

2011-10-22T00:12:59  <ChrisH_> the tricky part is deciding the right goals in the right order and having fast code to figure out the best way to get the ants from where they are at to where they need to be

2011-10-22T00:14:48  <bobbydroptable> any formation with corners is vulnerable
2011-10-22T00:14:57  <Fluxid> did anyone actually implement "formations"?

2011-10-22T01:09:13  <bobbydroptable_> I'm not sure why 55 is the radius though, bit weird.
2011-10-22T01:09:36  <bobbydroptable_> causes my ants to ignore food right on the outskirts of their vision , so i had to adjust the threshold a little.
2011-10-22T01:10:01  <foob> from the site: Each bot is passed a parameter at the start of the game indicating the square of each ants visibility, which is how far each ant can see around them. At the moment this is set at 55, giving a view radius of approximately 7.4.
2011-10-22T01:10:41  <Zannick> antimatroid: so what's up?
2011-10-22T01:10:43  <foob> so as Zannick said, since it's an approximation of a circle 55 is the square of the distance from your ant you can see
2011-10-22T01:10:56  <bobbydroptable_> so if food is 8 squares away they cannot see it?
2011-10-22T01:10:59  <foob> sqrt(55) = 7.41619849
2011-10-22T01:11:04  <foob> guess not!

2011-10-22T01:11:48  <antimatroid> when making tesellation symmetric maps, i have n = number of players, rows, cols = rows/columns in the grid and row_t, col_t = translate amounts, you can translate a location by translate(loc) = ((loc.row+row_t)%rows, (loc.col+col_t)%cols) and I pick the parameters such translate^n(loc) = loc for all locations in the grid which requires n = lcm(rows/gcd(rows, row_t), cols/gcd(cols, col_t)), now janzert etc. want to be ab
2011-10-22T01:12:00  <antimatroid> the question is, does this give us all possible tesselation combinations?
2011-10-22T01:12:06  <antimatroid> i think it does, but yeah, it's a little messy :P
2011-10-22T01:12:34  <bobbydroptable_> though doesn't really make sense ,because if it was in the 8th square, 7.4 would see SOME of the food at least. lol

2011-10-22T01:14:47  <shane__> C# starter pack parses "r" as food removed, is that even a value?

2011-10-22T01:15:06  <vortex> I have a question about map symmetry.  The specification says the maps will be "symmetric".  Define "symmetric".
2011-10-22T01:15:09  <antimatroid> who is the c# starter bot person?
2011-10-22T01:15:47  <shane__> thanks antimatroid I was just making sure, C# has some goofy stuff missing that is in python I wanted to make sure.
2011-10-22T01:16:01  <antimatroid> vortex: each player has first access to a symmetrically equivalent portion of the board as everyone else

2011-10-22T01:16:20  <f_unk> antimatroid, why does scoring restart from 0 when you improve your bot?
2011-10-22T01:16:27  <antimatroid> and food spawns symmetrically to starting positions
2011-10-22T01:17:10  <vortex> antimatroid:  ok, then define "symmetrically equivalent" ;)
2011-10-22T01:17:13  <foob> antimatroid: okay, that makes sense, but it sounds like you'd have to break the grid or define symmetric by how far ants have to move...
2011-10-22T01:17:32  <foob> (to get to the food)
2011-10-22T01:18:08  <bobbydroptable_> python starter pack doesn't keep track of current turn .
2011-10-22T01:18:12  <bobbydroptable_> just a note
2011-10-22T01:18:25  <antimatroid> a few reasons i can think of, 1. you are forced to see how your bot does against lower ranked players everytime you resubmit, there were a few surprises imo with planet wars when rankings were reset for the final tournament, 2. you could "game" the leaderboard a bit before the final contest in planetwars by resubmitting all the game and getting lots of games and boosting your ranking etc.
2011-10-22T01:18:55  <vortex> antimatroid: here's one way to ask the question.  suppose I submit a map to you folks.  What's your algorithm to verify that it is symmetric?
2011-10-22T01:19:17  <foob> +1 to vortex
2011-10-22T01:19:24  <antimatroid> vortex: if you take one players set of first or equal access first squares then there exists translation values and a rotation such that you can map this to each other players first access or equal first access squares

2011-10-22T01:21:43  <a1k0n> dumb question, can a player's ants swap positions without colliding?

2011-10-22T01:23:01  <vortex> non-symmetric would have been a blunder, IMO.  You'd need huge sample sizes to discern skill rather than luck of the map draw
2011-10-22T01:23:21  <antimatroid> yeah, imo there's already enough noise in ranking bots, we should minimise that as much as possible
2011-10-22T01:24:29  <Guest19719> antimatroid: the best way to get rid of noise right now would be to play more games :-)

2011-10-22T01:29:56  <antimatroid> tron and ants offer much more obvious approaches that will yield positive results, especially ants you have a lot of things to work on like path finding, defense, battles etc.

2011-10-22T01:43:18  <antimatroid> deltree_: are you indexing a grid with [x][y] instead of [row][col]?
2011-10-22T01:43:30  <antimatroid> or are you moving an ant into a square before moving another one out?
2011-10-22T01:43:56  <antimatroid> for the love of god, do not index things with [x][y]
2011-10-22T01:44:23  <deltree_> I'm sure it's something stupid.  I attempted to implement strict rules, that if there were an ant in the way it would simply give up
2011-10-22T01:44:34  <Guest19719> deltree_: in my code I have a "decide which direction ants want to move" pass and then a "move ants" pass which only moves them if the square they want to move to is (or is becoming) unoccupied

2011-10-22T02:45:11  <ruser> antimatroid: what woudl be a good way of fiding out which ant should be heading for a target? just iterate?
2011-10-22T02:45:32  <antimatroid> multi source and multi target search :P
2011-10-22T02:45:53  <AndrewBC> mmm, solved my timeout problem
2011-10-22T02:45:55  <antimatroid> in the forums i explain about finding a minimum path from a source location to a target location using a*
2011-10-22T02:46:07  <antimatroid> that's my method anyway
2011-10-22T02:46:54  <ruser> antimatroid:  can you link me to that thread?

2011-10-22T02:47:06  <AndrewBC> the wrapper that called A* generalization seeking food had a really low weight for unexplored area, so it was searching that too, so if an ant had no food around it, it'd try for the entire map

2011-10-22T02:48:12  <question_> ugh this is frustrating
2011-10-22T02:49:34  <question_> the way the tutorial makes it sound is that there is a way to determine the distance between an ant and food, I am looking at state.cc which can get the input type f, I just cant figure out how to get the values from there
2011-10-22T02:49:40  <question_> the forum has been of no help
2011-10-22T02:49:52  <question_> and I have been staring at this for the past 4 hours
2011-10-22T02:50:34  <ruser> question_: there should be a function atleast  there is one in python and c#
2011-10-22T02:50:38  <ruser> and java
2011-10-22T02:50:44  <question_> i am using c++
2011-10-22T02:50:46  <antimatroid> question_: it appears i don't have a manhatten distance function for c++
2011-10-22T02:50:55  <antimatroid> i wrote that bot so i can help you out with this :)
2011-10-22T02:50:58  <question_> i just catn figure out what the function is
2011-10-22T02:51:12  <ruser> question_:  probably distance ? :)
2011-10-22T02:51:23  <antimatroid> in the State struct there is a distance function for euclidean distance between two squares
2011-10-22T02:51:37  <question_> but how do i know where the food square is
2011-10-22T02:51:43  <antimatroid> so if you called say state.distance(antLoc, foodLoc) you would get back the euclidean distance between these two locations
2011-10-22T02:51:46  <ruser> question_:  State.cc:double State::distance(const Location &loc1, const Location &loc2)
2011-10-22T02:51:50  <antimatroid> you have a vector of food locations in state :)

2011-10-22T02:59:07  <antimatroid> breadth first is the simplest: add a food location onto a search queue and mark the location as added, then while you haven't found a path to an ant pull the front location off, then for each neighbour if it's an ant you've got a shortest path otherwise if the location hasn't been added to the queue add it and mark it as added
2011-10-22T02:59:31  <antimatroid> a* is bfs with a heuristic function to speed it up
2011-10-22T03:00:00  <ruser> but for that to work i need to know which ant is hte closest
2011-10-22T03:00:03  <ruser> right?
2011-10-22T03:00:19  <antimatroid> that's where my multi source and multi target a* thing comes in ;)
2011-10-22T03:00:32  <antimatroid> it finds a shortest path from a source to a target
2011-10-22T03:00:41  <ruser> or are you using the reverse start with food and do bfs to closest ant?
2011-10-22T03:00:58  <antimatroid> doesn't matter, you might have multiple ants and multiple food
2011-10-22T03:01:01  <ruser> by closest, either of ?
2011-10-22T03:01:05  <antimatroid> you don't know which food has the shortest path to an ant

2011-10-22T03:03:14  <ruser> antimatroid: what do you use for heuristic?  mdist?
2011-10-22T03:03:20  <antimatroid> and i'll even go a step further and reuse ants that have collected food, just mark off when they're available to actually move and keep searching while the shortest possible path is below the currently best path found
2011-10-22T03:03:36  <antimatroid> hdist = min mdist from current location to any target location
2011-10-22T03:03:42  <antimatroid> then hdist is admissible
2011-10-22T03:04:45  <ruser> does the mdist take into account  water? or just any mdist?
2011-10-22T03:07:24  <ruser> so basically you loop over food locations (or any other important lcoations) find the first movable ant via a* and move it. rinse and repeat?
2011-10-22T03:07:54  <antimatroid> you are searching because of the water
2011-10-22T03:08:01  <antimatroid> mdist is just your wrapped manhatten distance
2011-10-22T03:08:19  <ruser> wrapped?
2011-10-22T03:08:20  <antimatroid> (don't forget to wrap is so squares closer across wrapped edges get the right distance)

2011-10-22T03:30:25  <djs> i cannot figure out how to get c# bot working on local machine for testing...i am reading the tutorial but it shows python and java...and i cant quite get it to work right with c#
2011-10-22T03:30:35  <x-layer> how often does it run games?
2011-10-22T03:30:54  <x-layer> for me it says next game in 1000+ minutes
2011-10-22T03:31:02  <pipeep> Anonymous19720, the only times I miss food is when it isn't in a direct line-of-sight

2011-10-22T03:32:13  <Anonymous19720> pipeep: turn 81, look at the ant at the top
2011-10-22T03:32:53  <Anonymous19720> pipeep: why isn't it moving down to pick up the food 3 tiles below it?
2011-10-22T03:33:05  <pipeep> Sometimes movements get randomized
2011-10-22T03:33:16  <pipeep> Well, not exactly randomized, but...
2011-10-22T03:33:34  <pipeep> It helps to get un-stuck from corners sometimes
2011-10-22T03:34:27  <pipeep> If anyone wants the previous version of my bot, as something to test against, that works better than the example bots, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/716853/explore_ant.zip
2011-10-22T03:35:31  <pipeep> The code is kinda hackish, but the idea is simple: on each turn, prefer to move to the adjacent square that has been touched the least

2011-10-22T03:40:20  <bobbydroptable_> for example, if it has gone in a straight line, and reaches a wall, it turns around and goes back the way it came. lol
2011-10-22T03:40:32  <bobbydroptable_> or if it runs into another ant, it goes "oh you've explored this" and turns back

2011-10-22T03:42:00  <shrey> "Crashed.. 0 turns"
2011-10-22T03:42:29  <bobbydroptable_> in your java
2011-10-22T03:42:56  <bobbydroptable_> put System.err.println("")
2011-10-22T03:43:20  <bobbydroptable_> that should (if i remember correctly) output to the error stream (not the standard output, which is what the engine uses to send/receive commands from your bot)
2011-10-22T03:43:30  <shrey> ohk!
2011-10-22T03:43:38  <bobbydroptable_> then if you feed the bot inputs into your program directly you should be able to find why it died

2011-10-22T03:51:07  <Katsuto> nvm
2011-10-22T03:51:09  <bobbydroptable_> then type the commands from http://aichallenge.org/specification.php into the bot

2011-10-22T03:51:52  <bobbydroptable_> or if you run playgame.cmd with -I it will generate the input files for you and you can feed it into your bot
2011-10-22T03:52:08  <shrey> hmm...i get your point
2011-10-22T03:52:10  <Katsuto> Is it against the rules to communicate with a server?  let's say Port 80
2011-10-22T03:52:11  <shrey> let me try..
2011-10-22T03:53:15  <bobbydroptable_> Katsuto probably
2011-10-22T03:53:33  <bobbydroptable_> everything that is required for the bot to function should exist on the server itself
2011-10-22T03:53:54  <Katsuto> alright. what about embedding the map files in the bot then?
2011-10-22T03:55:12  <bobbydroptable_> why would you do that?

2011-10-22T03:56:02  <bobbydroptable_> shrey it'd have to be a very specific condition then
2011-10-22T03:56:13  <bobbydroptable_> i'd try and generate the game file that led to the crash

2011-10-22T03:59:23  <Six> Katsuto: I'm not sure if it would be feasible, as the maps are generated, and there are a number of generators, so I think there would be a lot of maps

2011-10-22T04:00:13  <Six> oh ha
2011-10-22T04:00:21  <shrey> bobbydroptable_: you know the sample input at the spec page has "turn 1" details and so on..on the other hand..this particular input file ends at "ready"
2011-10-22T04:00:28  <shrey> am I being to dumb? :D
2011-10-22T04:00:28  <bobbydroptable_> there is no guarantee that the maps in the future will be the same as the current ones
2011-10-22T04:00:29  <Katsuto> ah.. too bad eh?  lol
2011-10-22T04:00:55  <Six> yeah, in reading the description they mentioned something about doing something to deter hard coding maps
2011-10-22T04:01:08  <bobbydroptable_> shrey - i'm not sure :(
2011-10-22T04:01:16  <bobbydroptable_> shrey have you tried Test_Bot?

2011-10-22T04:09:47  <bobbydroptable_> and i don't see how you can identify a map just based on what is immediately shown to you in the beginning anyway
2011-10-22T04:10:03  <bobbydroptable_> maybe from the hill positions?

2011-10-22T04:12:18  <Katsuto> since the maps are pretty binaries array, it's quite easy in fact ..
2011-10-22T04:12:59  <Katsuto> it probably could take a few moves to be confident your in map X, but it doesn't matter even if it'd take 20 moves

2011-10-22T04:16:32  *** ethercrow <ethercrow!~ethercrow@89.31.118.163> has left #aichallenge
2011-10-22T04:16:51  <Katsuto> it would be nice to know the color of the ants that you come across... you don't have any data that allows you to differentiate a player's ants and another player's ants right?
2011-10-22T04:17:02  <Six> Katsuto: they work hard to make each hill the same strength as others
2011-10-22T04:17:15  <Katsuto> geographically speaking, yes
2011-10-22T04:17:20  <Six> you get the data on the owner of the ants I think
2011-10-22T04:17:23  <Six> including corpses
2011-10-22T04:17:39  <Katsuto> I was speaking in term of observed ants density in the region
2011-10-22T04:17:47  <Six> ah
2011-10-22T04:17:53  <Katsuto> ok, that's even better than
2011-10-22T04:18:10  <Six> yeah, the corpse thing is kinda cool
2011-10-22T04:18:30  <Six> wasn't quite clear about piles of corpses
2011-10-22T04:19:11  <Katsuto> as you could grossly evalute the force of each player and choose the seaminly weaker hill based on that and observed regional density/activity etc
2011-10-22T04:19:19  <Katsuto> right
2011-10-22T04:19:31  <bobbydroptable_> but you only see a certain number of ants
2011-10-22T04:19:34  <bobbydroptable_> and you don't know how many players there are
2011-10-22T04:19:49  <bobbydroptable_> though you can guess from the map
2011-10-22T04:19:51  <Katsuto> you know how many players when you know which map you're in, no?
2011-10-22T04:19:56  <Katsuto> exact
2011-10-22T04:20:33  <Katsuto> you don't need to see all the ant to get an advantage with this algo.
2011-10-22T04:20:42  <bobbydroptable_> well i'm not here to win i'm just here to have fun ^^
2011-10-22T04:21:21  <Katsuto> lol  and I'm glad you are. I don't care much about winning either.
2011-10-22T04:22:16  <Katsuto> about the mapjisu thing: you can also add info to your maps for your code to act upon
2011-10-22T04:23:05  <Katsuto> as for example, you could add data about where to guard to prevent an invasion
2011-10-22T04:23:11  <Six> yeah, you could generate info on food density
2011-10-22T04:23:15  <Katsuto> I'm talking about maze map, of course
2011-10-22T04:23:24  <Katsuto> yep :)
2011-10-22T04:23:28  <bobbydroptable_> i'm surprised my graphing algorithm hasn't timedoutlol

2011-10-22T04:24:14  <Katsuto> I guess the timeout is dependent on the performance of their computers
2011-10-22T04:24:19  <Six> Katsuto: what I was thinking rather than a list of the maps, is you could pretty accuratly guess the map shape with only seeing some of it, due to the restrictions
2011-10-22T04:24:30  <Katsuto> if they run monsters, then there's a lot you can do in 1000 ms
2011-10-22T04:25:17  <rongq> Regarding the Java starter package: Is the map updated automatically when water, food and other ilk are discovered?
2011-10-22T04:25:35  <Katsuto> yea?  I'm trying to figure out how..    that would be great since the final probably will have new maps.
2011-10-22T04:26:23  <Katsuto> restrictions? do you mean repetitions?

2011-10-22T04:39:15  <pipeep> I'm thinking that if you were to do pathfinding, you could potentially use extra CPU time at the beginning to pre-compute things that may be useful later on
2011-10-22T04:39:31  <bobbydroptable_> pipeep i'm doing something like that
2011-10-22T04:39:44  <bobbydroptable_> what i've done is created a grid of squares each with paths
2011-10-22T04:40:01  <bobbydroptable_> at the beginning i'm going to traverse the graph from my hills, and update cost/ impossible paths along the way
2011-10-22T04:40:16  <bobbydroptable_> so any new ants will be able to figure out where to go right from spawn
2011-10-22T04:40:35  <bobbydroptable_> i think there is a timeout for getting ready though"?

2011-10-22T06:03:11  <smiley1983> TCP games run the bot on your local machine, so games come in very quickly
2011-10-22T06:05:05  <Anonymous19720> did the tcp server break?  I'm getting timeouts
2011-10-22T06:05:16  <ash0d> same here

2011-10-22T06:10:45  <ash0d> the timeout issue is very tricky and doesn't get easier with larger maps, longer games and more complex algorithms
2011-10-22T06:11:05  <ash0d> and that's stating the obvious :)
2011-10-22T06:11:09  <AndrewBC> :P
2011-10-22T06:11:47  <AndrewBC> I'm using a goroutine that sleeps then sends a timeout over a channel to my bot, which fires off every ant's turn concurrently
2011-10-22T06:11:58  <AndrewBC> Ot
2011-10-22T06:12:44  <AndrewBC> It's a bit more work to have every ant send to the herder that they're finished so the herder can tally and advance when all are accounted for, but guh this pathfinding is killing me
2011-10-22T06:15:10  <Saulzar> Goroutine I guess is threads? Pity for the non C languages .. hehe.
2011-10-22T06:15:39  <AndrewBC> it's Go's flavor of CSPs
2011-10-22T06:16:05  <AndrewBC> they multiplex on top of threads largely transparently (or not if there's only 1)
2011-10-22T06:16:43  <AndrewBC> but even if there's no parallelism which I'm guessing not because the rules forbid threads, I still gain concurrency easily, woot woot
2011-10-22T06:18:45  <Saulzar> Hmm

2011-10-22T06:22:25  <Saulzar> But I'm still re-writing the starter kit and the library I used isn't on the server, so I'm not getting far
2011-10-22T06:22:26  <ikaros> do new spawned ants come at the end of the input? so can i assume that x-th ant in list stays x-th ant as long as no ant dies?
2011-10-22T06:22:26  <Saulzar> Doh
2011-10-22T06:23:18  <AndrewBC> Yeah Saulzar I have yet to submit beyond the starter pack. Making progress nonetheless
2011-10-22T06:23:27  <AndrewBC> stick with it!
2011-10-22T06:23:43  <ReijiMitsurugi> is the tcp server working for anyone?
2011-10-22T06:23:54  <AndrewBC> it's kind of an investment that will pay off over the next week or so
2011-10-22T06:24:20  <Saulzar> I put a request on the forum for them to install a library - not sure if I should keep at it and hope they install it or start from scratch

2011-10-22T07:00:05  <Mixailo> It was already dead last night, so I'm afraid we have to wait till monday
2011-10-22T07:00:22  <Tommygun>    Submission?
2011-10-22T07:00:32  <Tommygun> dead?
2011-10-22T07:00:33  <Anonymous19720> Tommygun: uploading, you mean?
2011-10-22T07:00:38  <Tommygun> yeah
2011-10-22T07:00:38  <Mixailo> I'm talking about running, submission seems to be ok.
2011-10-22T07:01:07  <Tommygun> well I'm getting a compile error
2011-10-22T07:01:19  <Tommygun> apparently it's not seeing the MyBot.java
2011-10-22T07:01:32  <Mixailo> Does it run ok on your local host?
2011-10-22T07:01:35  <Tommygun> Yes
2011-10-22T07:02:02  <olexs> Tommygun: is your MyBot.java inside of any java packages (subfolders)?
2011-10-22T07:02:34  <Tommygun> Nope, but I'll give you the results of my diagnosis
2011-10-22T07:02:50  <Tommygun> I downloaded the ordinal java starter package
2011-10-22T07:03:01  <Tommygun> which uploaded fine on my PC, but not my mac
2011-10-22T07:03:23  <Tommygun> so i replaced the MyBot.java in that file with my edited version
2011-10-22T07:03:33  <Tommygun> and the compile fails
2011-10-22T07:03:59  <Tommygun> So, either the problem is in zipping, or with MyBot.java right?
2011-10-22T07:04:11  <olexs> seems so.
2011-10-22T07:04:25  <olexs> starter package not uploading from your mac is weird though...
2011-10-22T07:04:41  <Tommygun> It's lion.
2011-10-22T07:04:42  <Anonymous19720> different version of java maybe?
2011-10-22T07:04:45  <Tommygun> crazy shit happens.
2011-10-22T07:05:15  <Tommygun> Actually, different versions of java might be it
2011-10-22T07:05:28  <Tommygun> Let me check netbeans

2011-10-22T07:23:24  <Tommygun> Is Reiji still around?
2011-10-22T07:24:04  <wangchun> spawn 8 ants and just hunt for hills, blitzkrieg
2011-10-22T07:24:07  <Six> I could see doing a quick spread to get food for a number of cycles, then having nearby ants form into lines that walk together being very successful
2011-10-22T07:24:10  <cyphase> would be interesting if the ants had to take the food back to a hill before it could spawn
2011-10-22T07:24:19  <cyphase> supply lines :P
2011-10-22T07:24:26  <Tommygun> indeed
2011-10-22T07:24:35  <Six> yeah, as it is it's not very anty
2011-10-22T07:24:37  <Tommygun> Ant lines would be broken by terrain alot
2011-10-22T07:24:44  <Tommygun> to the point of uselessness
2011-10-22T07:25:12  <Tommygun> Anyone want to take a look at that media fire link I posted?
2011-10-22T07:25:15  <Six> if there were set food locations and it needed to be returned to the hill, that would be more antlike
2011-10-22T07:25:18  <Tommygun> look for oddities
2011-10-22T07:25:28  <ReijiMitsurugi> Tommygun: yes, I am still around.

2011-10-22T07:26:00  <ReijiMitsurugi> Tommygun: you need it in the top level directory

2011-10-22T07:30:24  <ikaros> =)
2011-10-22T07:31:52  <UncleVasya> I think if some of your ants don't know what to do it's better to send them always in one specified direction (west for example).

2011-10-22T07:34:23  <Tommygun> I would agree
2011-10-22T07:34:47  <wangchun> Do you guys think updating unvisited locations each turn is overkill to help choose where to go when there's no nearby food?
2011-10-22T07:36:48  <ReijiMitsurugi> UncleVasya: so that's sort of true. I tried that approach but what you find is that you get some ants being retarded and just going left and right or w/e and missing turn offs in the maze like maps.
2011-10-22T07:36:59  <UncleVasya> wangchun: Do you mean keeping info about squares you don't see now but have seen before?
2011-10-22T07:38:29  <UncleVasya> ReijiMitsurugi: yep, that was a problem when I was on that stage. Now all my free ants spread out to the nearest boundary.

2011-10-22T07:43:11  <UncleVasya> wangchun: oh, sry. You said 'unvisited', not 'invisible'. Can not clearly understand what you mean but I think there are simplier ways to make a jobe for your ants.
2011-10-22T07:44:02  <wangchun> UncleVasya: I'm just thinking about how to move ants around when they have no hill or food to go to yet, randomly choosing a direction isn't working too great
2011-10-22T07:44:46  <ReijiMitsurugi> wangchun: how about moving them to a place they haven't seen yet?
2011-10-22T07:45:01  <UncleVasya> wangchun: I use following (and think it's a pretty good):
2011-10-22T07:45:07  <Tommygun> Should take a look at the tutorials
2011-10-22T07:46:30  <UncleVasya> 1. Make boundary list. This is a list of squares with the following condition: I see this square and it has a neighbour that I don't see.
2011-10-22T07:47:19  <UncleVasya> 2. After food gathering I launching the search like for food list but for boundary lis.
2011-10-22T07:47:32  <UncleVasya> *I launch
2011-10-22T07:48:26  <UncleVasya> sry for my English, I try to speak correctly but some here are still some errors.

2011-10-22T08:00:43  <UncleVasya> BFS is okay for me. The thing you must think about is how to decrease the number of search launches.
2011-10-22T08:03:06  <UncleVasya> It's much better to make one search from many sources simultaniously than do it from the beginning for every source.
2011-10-22T08:03:33  <DataWraith> That sounds like B* would be perfectly suited for the challenge.
2011-10-22T08:04:29  <UncleVasya> Also is nice to figure out when you don't need to process invisible squares in the search.

2011-10-22T08:07:24  <antimatroid> not sure if google will help
2011-10-22T08:07:26  <antimatroid> but it works
2011-10-22T08:07:35  <antimatroid> just add all ant locations to your search queue at the start
2011-10-22T08:07:41  <antimatroid> movable ants anyway
2011-10-22T08:07:50  <UncleVasya> It's something antimatroid invented by himself :)
2011-10-22T08:08:01  <antimatroid> i highly doubt it's original

2011-10-22T08:10:44  <Fluxid> < antimatroid> just add all ant locations to your search queue at the start  i'm doing something similar but adding targets to queue. because targets move less, i don't need to regenerate "direction map" so often (but then it's not a*)
2011-10-22T08:11:04  <Mixailo> Thanks, I've already read this topic :) But I'm thinking about slightly different solution
2011-10-22T08:11:08  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: Haven't you heard about average server speed admins will try to keep? In games per minute.
2011-10-22T08:11:14  <antimatroid> Fluxid: i think i do the same
2011-10-22T08:11:29  <antimatroid> it's also easier to work out which direction the ant needs to go if you search from food to ants
2011-10-22T08:11:47  <antimatroid> although it makes it slightly harder when you're searching with ants that are available in the future, but still alright
2011-10-22T08:11:57  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: nope? :P
2011-10-22T08:12:53  <Fluxid> i do everything from X to ants now: food, hills and unseen parts of map... but i need to change this, because now many ants at once can ruch to the same food, which does not make sense because i can dispatch one per food
2011-10-22T08:12:59  <UncleVasya> About 4 packs: you guys have missed a cool snake bot :P

2011-10-22T08:38:25  <ash0d> cool
2011-10-22T08:38:31  <ash0d> someone is already playing !

2011-10-22T08:38:59  <Fluxid> ash0d: what server is this?
2011-10-22T08:39:21  <UncleVasya> deltree_: ] <ash0d> http://212.34.245.143:2080  <---- TCP
2011-10-22T08:39:31  <ash0d> mine
2011-10-22T08:39:46  <ash0d> I just put something together based on the original code
2011-10-22T08:39:48  <Fluxid> ok, but what does it do?
2011-10-22T08:39:51  <deltree_> thanks, I'll have to put together a client
2011-10-22T08:40:07  <ash0d> http://212.34.245.143:2080/howto
2011-10-22T08:40:11  <deltree_> I have a client on my machine
2011-10-22T08:40:19  <UncleVasya> Fluxid: It is for fast testing of your bot again another people.
2011-10-22T08:40:20  <ash0d> download a python client and connect and play against others :)
2011-10-22T08:40:30  <deltree_> so at least I can test for simple stuff
2011-10-22T08:40:36  <Fluxid> well, i ask because i can't connect ;D
2011-10-22T08:40:39  <ash0d> let me know if you find any problems
2011-10-22T08:40:51  <Dispatch> looking good, thx ash!
2011-10-22T08:40:53  <UncleVasya> Fluxid: You can test different version of your bot.
2011-10-22T08:40:56  <deltree_> and I have GOT to stop having my ants run into each other, looks like I'm sending multiple commands to 1 ant and that's the reason, gotta track it down
2011-10-22T08:41:09  <ash0d> Fluxid, you can't connect to the web server or the game server?
2011-10-22T08:41:15  <Fluxid> web server
2011-10-22T08:41:29  <Fluxid> curl: (7) couldn't connect to host
2011-10-22T08:41:36  <Fluxid> which is strange because i can ping it

2011-10-22T08:42:17  <deltree_> the tcp is a tradition at AI Challenge

2011-10-22T08:44:08  <Fluxid> how do i register?
2011-10-22T08:44:13  <ikaros> are there plans to upgrade the official server count or capacity?
2011-10-22T08:44:50  <deltree_> ash0d: so I can run the tcp with other file types, right, not just python?
2011-10-22T08:45:25  <ash0d> yes
2011-10-22T08:45:36  <ash0d> you have to replace the runner with your command, whatever that is
2011-10-22T08:45:57  <Fluxid> ash0d: how do i get user and password? it gets registered on the first try?
2011-10-22T08:46:10  <ash0d> just use any username and password
2011-10-22T08:46:22  <ash0d> make sure the username is unique, that's all
2011-10-22T08:46:49  <ReijiMitsurugi> ash0d: I should connect on port 2081 right?
2011-10-22T08:47:01  <ReijiMitsurugi> ah yes I've got a game

2011-10-22T09:16:36  <Anonymous19720> ReijiMitsurugi: probably because there's only a few bots
2011-10-22T09:16:45  <ReijiMitsurugi> and the only reason there's so many for unclevasya is because his dies in 1 turn
2011-10-22T09:16:58  <Anonymous19720> ReijiMitsurugi: when they finish, all the other bots are busy, so they get matched against each other again for lack of other opponents

2011-10-22T09:25:23  <ReijiMitsurugi> what jmcarthur said
2011-10-22T09:25:33  <bobbydroptable_> and then you move it into another square and its no longer there
2011-10-22T09:25:34  <bobbydroptable_> i have to update it
2011-10-22T09:25:58  <jmcarthur> why do you need a persistent identifier?
2011-10-22T09:26:06  <jmcarthur> why do you care about persistent identity, rather?
2011-10-22T09:26:13  <ReijiMitsurugi> jmcarthur: if you have state associated with particular ants
2011-10-22T09:26:19  <jmcarthur> i don't see any reason that it should matter that this ant is the same ant from last turn
2011-10-22T09:26:38  <bobbydroptable_> if you're trying to do agent oriented, then it does
2011-10-22T09:26:51  <bobbydroptable_> because you assign a task to a particular ant

2011-10-22T09:28:35  <bobbydroptable_> without remember where it is supposed to go "state" it'll just wander at the same spot
2011-10-22T09:29:25  <UncleVasya> maybe he want make an assumption that game state doesn't chnged much and good plan from last turns is still good and he doesn't need to re-calculate it.
2011-10-22T09:29:38  <bobbydroptable_> that's basically it
2011-10-22T09:29:50  <bobbydroptable_> else i'll be calculating a*star every turn for a hundred ants

2011-10-22T10:41:08  <exezive> regarding "Hills not implemented yet" : Does it mean that the starter package just abit worse AI than the ones that have hills implemented?
2011-10-22T10:42:15  <deltree_> exezive: actually, the starter package doesn't DO anything with the hills, but having them implemented means the objects are already there for you to play with
2011-10-22T10:42:31  <deltree_> exezive: the starter package barely makes teh ants move
2011-10-22T10:42:55  <exezive> deltree_, ah ok. so basically if I choose with no hills implementation I have to do just abit more work
2011-10-22T10:43:18  <deltree_> exezive: that's correct, you'll have to understand how to parse hills and implement them yourself

2011-10-22T11:12:36  <deltree_> awishformore: I don't have any issues and my exe isn't named mybot
2011-10-22T11:12:54  <awishformore> deltree_: I wasn't talking about the executable name if you read my message again.
2011-10-22T11:13:20  <awishformore> I was talking about the path
2011-10-22T11:13:21  <deltree_> I use fullpath
2011-10-22T11:13:23  <ash0d> awishformore: let me know if you figure it out
2011-10-22T11:13:25  <smiley1983> ikaros: did you see the above discussion about getting a python bot to work in *nix? It might apply to your case as well
2011-10-22T11:13:33  <ikaros> wow.. thx smiley1983 .. when i write a shell script to wrap the luajit bla.. call it works
2011-10-22T11:13:33  <deltree_> I don't need anything in the same directory
2011-10-22T11:13:44  <ikaros> no but i just managed it i think
2011-10-22T11:13:49  <smiley1983> great :)
2011-10-22T11:13:53  <ikaros> yea :))
2011-10-22T11:14:06  <ikaros> now its time to let it fight *g
2011-10-22T11:14:33  <awishformore> deltree_: you're not being very helpful...I provided an exact problem description + error message, just saying it works for you doesn't contribute anything
2011-10-22T11:14:58  <deltree_> awishformore: if you had used proper grammar I'd UNDERSTAND your problem
2011-10-22T11:15:21  <volkhin> fluxid, nice server, thx:)
2011-10-22T11:15:59  <deltree_> based on your traceback, you're running *nix am I correct?

2011-10-22T11:24:14  <smiley1983> awishformore: I'm not sure about the exe-location problem, but you may find that renaming the .exe changes the name in the visualizer (e.g version001.exe)
2011-10-22T11:24:53  <awishformore> smiley1983: no, the visualizer always just displays player1-4, the exe name doesn't change that on my setup unfortunately

2011-10-22T11:26:32  <smiley1983> awishformore: okay, that's a nuisance. First question about your setup: did you clone the repository, or download tools.zip?
2011-10-22T11:26:35  <lrh9> Forgive my ignorance, but what is a tcp server and why is everyone talking about them?
2011-10-22T11:26:51  <awishformore> i just downloaded the tools

2011-10-22T11:28:09  <smiley1983> and assuming it was definitely not the .tar.bz2, the next question is: can I see a paste of the full command you're using to run the game when it fails?
2011-10-22T11:28:15  <ash0d> yes
2011-10-22T11:28:20  <lrh9> Thanks.

2011-10-22T11:28:49  <smiley1983> awishformore: but if you had cloned the repo, the default setup might be tailored for *nix environments

2011-10-22T11:39:35  <Alexer> "On Unix, with shell=False (default): In this case, the Popen class uses os.execvp() to execute the child program. args should normally be a sequence. If a string is specified for args, it will be used as the name or path of the program to execute; this will only work if the program is being given no arguments."

2011-10-22T11:56:23  <Pilchard123> how?
2011-10-22T11:56:27  <ikaros> what's the usual view radius for ants?
2011-10-22T11:56:41  <Alexer> lrh9__, i don't know much about that
2011-10-22T11:56:46  <otzi> why do people make starter packages without hill support? It looks like that once you have ant and water support it shouldn't be any harder to implement hill support.
2011-10-22T11:57:00  <deltree_> paulwal: yes, and it needs to have the same interfaces as the other starter projects, basically, it needs to have anthills objects (if the language is oo) and such
2011-10-22T11:57:08  <GreenTea> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.242   not loose any ant ))
2011-10-22T11:57:13  <skyramp> ikaros: sqrt(77) ~ 7.4

2011-10-22T11:59:00  <n4nd0> hi
2011-10-22T11:59:11  <n4nd0> I have heard quite a lot lately about the TCP client
2011-10-22T11:59:18  <skyramp> ikaros: i don't think they would change that.. but afaik it is specified in game parameters (as viewradius2)
2011-10-22T11:59:20  <n4nd0> what is its use exactly?
2011-10-22T11:59:36  <ikaros> yea right! thx i will need to use that
2011-10-22T11:59:37  <n4nd0> is it for testing our bots?
2011-10-22T12:00:08  <Alexer> n4nd0, you run your bot on your own machine, so the tcp server is not loaded so much -> it can run games faster
2011-10-22T12:00:18  <deltree_> n4nd0: that, and if you use tcp, you get to play a lot more games, some players give more credit to the tcp ranking than the ai challenge ranking
2011-10-22T12:00:57  <ls1024> The ranking on the AI challenge really is useless unless you're in the top 200 or so.
2011-10-22T12:01:01  <n4nd0> Alexer, thank you :-)
2011-10-22T12:01:01  <ls1024> It's basically luck below that.

2011-10-22T12:17:21  <lrh9__> ermau, the amount of games you play is parameterized, letting you specify how many games you want to play.

2011-10-22T12:50:25  <Puj> Thanks jmcarthur, so if food square saved from last turn is visible but not in the delta food list, then it has been eaten?  Also, if an ant is next to a food which existed last turn it can be assumed eaten?
2011-10-22T12:50:44  <Puj> nightmare, I'm sure you are well on your way (=

2011-10-22T12:52:10  <Puj> Actually my first statement can't be true, the premise would have to be that the food was visible last turn and the same square is visible this turn, but the food doesn't appear in the new data.
2011-10-22T12:52:15  <Puj> Okay, thanks.

2011-10-22T12:55:49  <Fluxid> ash0d: i think creates problem that we start to battle on unofficial servers... they should speed up games on main server, there wouldn't be need for ours
2011-10-22T12:56:01  <ash0d> agreed
2011-10-22T12:56:10  <ash0d> but for now, this is a way to get us coding

2011-10-22T12:56:40  <otzi> nightmare: I agree, if it weren't for the rule which states that you can't save a file on the server we could actually write a bot that learns as it plays. I'm not sure why that's a rule.

2011-10-22T13:03:10  <nightmare> cause then they would spawn on eachother
2011-10-22T13:03:55  <lrh9__> Puj, there is no food eaten message. Each turn the server sends what food is on the map. If food was on the map last turn and it isn't this turn, that means it was eaten. (Or is no longer visible.)

2011-10-22T13:05:03  <Laventus> nightmare, one hill is capable of spawning one ant each turn, if there is enough food. In fact, if there's an ant on top of the hill, it doesn't spawn an ant even if there is food there.
2011-10-22T13:05:19  <Laventus> So you can spawn 2 ants a turn, if you have 2 hills.
2011-10-22T13:05:25  <Laventus> (and the food, of course)

2011-10-22T13:09:00  <nightmare> which is good i guess, otherwise it's more about luck on where you spawn, if you spawn next to an easy bot, you can take his hill and spawn double as much, that would be unfair

2011-10-22T13:12:14  <paulwal> I've written bots for the Risk boardgame. There is tons of luck involved.  The strong bots still overpower the weaker ones 90% of the time. The luck factor makes for interesting games to watch.

2011-10-22T13:33:23  <Alexer> ash0d, hmm, why? afaik windows ignores shell=xxx anyway, and since you're giving it a string, on other platforms you *need* shell=True so that it knows the string is not just the name of the executable. or did i miss something?
2011-10-22T13:33:23  <ash0d> GreenTea, your bot is damn good!
2011-10-22T13:33:47  <ash0d> python creates a new cmd.exe instance if you pass it shell=True

2011-10-22T13:41:11  <UncleVasya> thanks
2011-10-22T13:41:28  <_flag> Alexer: That's because his can only do 1v1s as it has less people

2011-10-22T13:49:37  <ash0d> UncleVasya, turntime is 5000, so half that time is your latency... hard to see how you can do TCP games

2011-10-22T13:49:48  <roflmao> I'm confused about something. Ants can only see squares adjacent to them, so how can you implement a* if you have no idea where the food squares are?

2011-10-22T13:50:39  <jmcarthur> roflmao: that's part of the challenge. you have to make educated guesses about what you can't see

2011-10-22T14:05:51  <antimatroid> a1k0n: that might have been my bad
2011-10-22T14:06:15  <Alexer> ash0d, btw, your bot is apparently better on maps with more players, if you compare rankings on fluxid's server and yours
2011-10-22T14:06:32  <ash0d> yes, I noticed
2011-10-22T14:07:05  <g0llum> Alexer, i think it's the last time you joined a game there

2011-10-22T14:24:36  <guily> but after the second part (search for food), they dont move

2011-10-22T15:02:08  <Alexer> jmcarthur, i just meant that '!' is more often used than '@' from what i've seen
2011-10-22T15:02:09  <g0llum> like a map, playercmds, etc
2011-10-22T15:02:29  <jmcarthur> yeah i gotcha. i was just seeing if ! worked at all
2011-10-22T15:02:36  <jmcarthur> some bots support a few different ways
2011-10-22T15:02:46  <guily> this is my call python tools/playgame.py "python MyBot.py" "python tools/sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py" --map_file tools/maps/example/tutorial1.map --log_dir game_logs --turns 60 --scenario --food none --player_seed 7 --verbose -e o -E -I -O
2011-10-22T15:03:08  <guily> it runs, but I do not get errors to the log file
2011-10-22T15:03:41  <g0llum> guily, still lacking -m 'map' and the list of players
2011-10-22T15:04:19  <guily> this is from the tutorial
2011-10-22T15:04:19  <Alexer> guily, nothing to apologize :D fyi, some irc clients don't hilight when the line does not start with the nick, so in that sense not having '@' at the start is better, but otherwise it's just a matter of opinion
2011-10-22T15:04:25  <AndrewBC> phew
2011-10-22T15:04:29  <guily> the map is specified in --map_file isn't it?

2011-10-22T15:25:31  <DataWraith> Hm. Maybe add food to the target-list whenever the server sends you the position?
2011-10-22T15:25:38  <AndrewBC> maybe that's why it's walking right by them

2011-10-22T15:28:05  <AndrewBC> yeah I should just take that out since I can always analyze other ants' move_queues
2011-10-22T15:28:29  <DataWraith> I just added a field to my map structure that says if an ant wants to go there already.
2011-10-22T15:29:00  <BluePeppers> I have a centralized movement mapping, but it assumes that ants allways move :/
2011-10-22T15:29:06  <AndrewBC> I only store long shot destinations in the map, interim collisions would still be possible

2011-10-22T16:37:06  <rockzombie2> oh hi
2011-10-22T16:37:08  <Alexer> in case it says "turn 0 bot 0 timed out" or something like that under the "Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases" error
2011-10-22T16:37:19  <Alexer> ah, you're here after all
2011-10-22T16:37:23  <Alexer> does it say so?
2011-10-22T16:37:43  <rockzombie2> it says turn 1 bot 0 timed out
2011-10-22T16:37:49  <magiik> meh freaking netbook isn't fast enough for this
2011-10-22T16:37:54  <Alexer> okay
2011-10-22T16:37:56  <_flag> Can someone running a tcp server not cut off matches at 150 turns for "food not being gathered" like this: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.751
2011-10-22T16:38:09  <_flag> Most of the servers are just running 1v1s now, so I keep getting a ton of draws
2011-10-22T16:38:17  <Alexer> rockzombie2, do you by any chance use sockets (for logging or something) :P
2011-10-22T16:38:29  <rockzombie2> hehe... i don't know what those are
2011-10-22T16:38:33  <rockzombie2> so probably not
2011-10-22T16:38:37  <Alexer> rockzombie2, good
2011-10-22T16:38:56  <Alexer> rockzombie2, have you tried running test_bot.sh/test_bot.cmd locally?
2011-10-22T16:39:23  <rockzombie2> yeah, i edited the play_one_game.cmd into run.cmd so i just call that and it tests my bot automatically
2011-10-22T16:39:30  <rockzombie2> it works when i test it on my laptop
2011-10-22T16:39:41  <rockzombie2> i mean its still a dumb ai but it works
2011-10-22T16:39:57  <Alexer> rockzombie2, but have you tried test_bot.cmd, since that's what the server apparently uses to test your bot
2011-10-22T16:40:07  <Alexer> that is, for example, "./test_bot.sh MyBot.py"
2011-10-22T16:40:13  <rockzombie2> no i should try that
2011-10-22T16:40:51  <Alexer> if that works, add "--turntime 500" to the start of the commandline
2011-10-22T16:41:07  <Alexer> since apparently the default is higher but the real servers use 500ms
2011-10-22T16:41:45  <Alexer> and if that works too, try with 100ms for good measure :P
2011-10-22T16:42:11  <Alexer> and if it still works, then i really have no idea
2011-10-22T16:42:46  <ebo^> why doesnt my bot run? it says ready to run, but players ahead changes randomly to numbers 0-10. it's been like that for hours
2011-10-22T16:42:51  <Alexer> in my case, i used sockets to log locally, and when i uploaded to the server, it obviously couldn't connect to my local socket and timed out
2011-10-22T16:43:20  <rockzombie2> yeah my test bot times out when i test it using test_bot.cmd
2011-10-22T16:46:08  <ash0d> _flag, what's a good cutoff?

2011-10-22T16:48:44  <_flag> So I'd change how the cutoff works, so for example less food needs to be gathered by 150
2011-10-22T16:48:54  <Alexer> ebo^, probably it put you in front, but then a new submission came before it could run yours :P
2011-10-22T16:48:58  <ash0d> _flag, that's the point of the cutoff, if 150 turns pass without food being gathered it ends the game
2011-10-22T16:49:06  <ash0d> so how many turns is good, you think?
2011-10-22T16:49:07  <_flag> But food is gathered
2011-10-22T16:49:12  <_flag> Just less than it expects
2011-10-22T16:49:25  <_flag> So change the amount of food it expects for a certain amount of turns
2011-10-22T16:49:28  <_flag> Not the cutoff
2011-10-22T16:50:29  <ash0d> I think the expected number is 0. but without reading the code I couldn't know for certain
2011-10-22T16:50:44  <ash0d> if 0 food is gathered in cutoff turns (default 150), game ends.
2011-10-22T16:50:55  <_flag> It can't be 0 because I collect more than 0 every time and it still cuts me off

2011-10-22T16:51:28  <AndrewBC> optimize your food gathering coverage to use as few ants as effectively as possible while still staying above the cutoff
2011-10-22T16:51:33  <_flag> Look at the game I linked you
2011-10-22T16:51:42  <_flag> The other player did gather; they both gathered

2011-10-22T16:55:26  <ash0d> AndrewBC, I don't think the engine keeps track of the geographic location of the food
2011-10-22T16:55:31  <_flag> Besides, the game would be stupid to cut off a bot because it missed one piece of food
2011-10-22T16:55:35  <AndrewBC> the engine just wants food
2011-10-22T16:55:35  <ash0d> it just counts gathered vs time
2011-10-22T16:56:09  <AndrewBC> I'm not saying not gathering -that- piece of food was a problem, just that not being able to gather it sooner contributed to the cutoff being reached
2011-10-22T16:56:16  <AndrewBC> it's a minor pedantic point to make :P
2011-10-22T16:56:17  <Alexer> ash0d, if you added a possibility of using -1 for the "rounds" parameter (for running continuously) and made that the default in the howto, it'd probably help the player shortage? >:P
2011-10-22T16:56:29  <_flag> Yes, but the cutoff is determined assuming there are no walls

2011-10-22T16:56:41  <ash0d> "If a game consists of bots that aren't capable of gathering food, then the game is cutoff. It is assumed that these are starter bots or very unsophisticated bots. If the total amount of food is 90% of the count of food and ants for 150 turns then the cutoff is invoked."

2011-10-22T16:57:17  <AndrewBC> mm, yeah, you know what, I agree with you that in this case the game shouldn't have been cut off

2011-10-22T16:57:54  <ash0d> I can change the cuttoff to 200

2011-10-22T17:00:00  <_flag> Well next time I see a contest organizer I'll ask for a more permanent solution, but right now I think changing it to more if the map happens to be a maze map should work fine

2011-10-22T17:34:44  <cirno_the_greate> DataWraith: this is for python bots?
2011-10-22T17:35:08  <DataWraith> cirno_the_greate: I haven't used it, but I think it's a python script that connects your bot to the server.
2011-10-22T17:35:28  <cirno_the_greate> hmm
2011-10-22T17:35:31  <DataWraith> cirno_the_greate: It still runs locally on your computer, in whatever language it is written in.

2011-10-22T17:38:13  <cirno_the_greate> it werks
2011-10-22T17:38:52  <Alexer> the only drawback is that if you have a slow (laggy) internet connection, your bot might time out because of that
2011-10-22T17:39:01  <Alexer> but at least i haven't run into that
2011-10-22T17:39:19  <cirno_the_greate> i have broadband everywhere, so it's fine

2011-10-22T17:43:11  <Cowbandit> is it like a tile for destination and tile for current location

2011-10-22T17:50:31  <Alexer> i got 177 or 148
2011-10-22T17:50:32  <Alexer> :P
2011-10-22T17:50:32  <jmcarthur> make that 177
2011-10-22T17:50:43  <jmcarthur> Alexer: why the "or"?
2011-10-22T17:51:16  <Alexer> jmcarthur, calculations said 177, counting squares on a replay got me 148 :P
2011-10-22T17:51:21  <pedrosorio> isn't it strange that the skill is mu - 3*sigma?
2011-10-22T17:51:22  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-10-22T17:51:52  <jmcarthur> pedrosorio: that is the normal trueskill formula
2011-10-22T17:51:53  <DataWraith> pedrosorio: No, it's a conservative estimate
2011-10-22T17:52:06  <DataWraith> pedrosorio: The system is 99% sure that you're better than what your skill says
2011-10-22T17:52:10  <jmcarthur> pedrosorio: your skill is a lower bound with some percent confidence
2011-10-22T17:52:19  <pedrosorio> but it seems to me that a bad bot
2011-10-22T17:52:30  <pedrosorio> that always performs the same
2011-10-22T17:52:33  <Alexer> jmcarthur, scratch that 177 or 241
2011-10-22T17:52:41  <jmcarthur> Alexer: o_O
2011-10-22T17:52:46  <pedrosorio> will sometimes have a better score
2011-10-22T17:52:57  <jmcarthur> Alexer: is the visualizer being inconsistent here?
2011-10-22T17:52:58  <pedrosorio> than a more unpredictable bot which is much better
2011-10-22T17:53:35  <pedrosorio> (for example, I wonder how there are so many bots worse than the "sample bots" provided)
2011-10-22T17:53:35  <Alexer> jmcarthur, on a replay, the area visible around a single ant is 17*17 squares minus the squares at the corners, which is 12*4
2011-10-22T17:53:39  <jmcarthur> DataWraith: if you are gettin 177 then we are probably right
2011-10-22T17:53:44  <Alexer> which comes to 241
2011-10-22T17:54:00  <DataWraith> jmcarthur: Uh. Like I said, I screwed up somewhere, and am trying to figure out where.
2011-10-22T17:54:03  <jmcarthur> Alexer: that seems... wrong
2011-10-22T17:54:09  <Alexer> 177 was calulated with the code in ants.py
2011-10-22T17:54:27  <jmcarthur> well, i'm getting 177 with my own code
2011-10-22T17:54:49  <Alexer> so: mx = int(math.sqrt(55)); sum([1 for d_row in range(-mx,mx+1) for d_col in range(-mx,mx+1) if d_row**2 + d_col**2 <= 55])

2011-10-22T18:01:37  <pedrosorio> DataWraith: Yeah I was thinking that exactly. But with too many people competing it's bound to be a problem (that the server can't run enough games to estimate the ability correctly)
2011-10-22T18:01:47  <DataWraith> Alexer: I would connect my bot, but my computer is busy evolving new rulesets already. ^^
2011-10-22T18:02:01  <DataWraith> pedrosorio: The ability is just a rough guide. Actual placement will be done via a tournament.
2011-10-22T18:02:29  <pedrosorio> DataWraith: or does the server stop running games for "stable" bots after a while? (It seems to be the case for my sample bot)
2011-10-22T18:03:03  <DataWraith> pedrosorio: I don't really know. From what I've seen, new uploads get to skip the queue, after that it's a queue.

2011-10-22T18:20:18  <DataWraith> Alexer: git is fairly smart when merging stuff around, so it shouldn't be a big issue.
2011-10-22T18:20:33  <jmcarthur> i would be careful with rebase though
2011-10-22T18:20:43  <jmcarthur> a rebase after pull is okay
2011-10-22T18:20:48  <DataWraith> ChuOne: I think so, yes. Python 2.
2011-10-22T18:20:50  <ruser> soon: if you want to experiment with ants seeing full map just give the viewradius2 input sufficient to cover whole map
2011-10-22T18:21:07  <jmcarthur> but there's not much point in rebase after pull if you don't mind merge commits
2011-10-22T18:21:08  <Alexer> DataWraith, i bet git *can* merge the changes back, but the point is that i think my master should equal the master of the official repo
2011-10-22T18:21:37  <jmcarthur> Alexer: local repos carry mirrors of remote repos, for the record
2011-10-22T18:21:42  <DataWraith> Alexer: If it comes to the worst, you can delete your fork and make a new one.

2011-10-22T18:25:09  <Alexer> UncleVasya, ha, what's the name of your bot? which server?
2011-10-22T18:25:30  <Alexer> ah, nevermind
2011-10-22T18:25:56  <DataWraith> Alexer: You push to your own fork on github, and you pull from upstream, which you may have to add as a remote manually.
2011-10-22T18:26:57  <DataWraith> Alexer: "git remote add upstream <url>"
2011-10-22T18:27:44  <Alexer> and i should (have) probably keep my master in sync with the master on upstream...
2011-10-22T18:27:48  <DataWraith> Alexer: Then you get the new stuff from the original repo with, I think, "git pull upstream master"
2011-10-22T18:28:38  <DataWraith> Alexer: If you add the --rebase option, it will rebase your work on top of the commits from master.
2011-10-22T18:28:42  <Alexer> btw, do you happen to know what's the equal with "git pull upstream master" with fetch + merge?

2011-10-22T18:40:08  <dai-ra> still they could improve things by ignoring bots with 'errors'
2011-10-22T18:40:20  <Alexer> errors?
2011-10-22T18:40:32  <dai-ra> not collecting food, etc

2011-10-22T18:42:34  <DataWraith> Too bad someone can't just spin up a couple of EC2 instances to help with simulation.
2011-10-22T18:43:08  <DataWraith> evening.
2011-10-22T18:43:15  <jmcarthur> didn't we do that in the last contest?
2011-10-22T18:43:22  <dai-ra> you would still be wasting cpu time with all those starter bots
2011-10-22T18:43:30  <Alexer> it could be better if the tutorial asked to run it with the local environment instead and added a "When you're happy with your bot against the example bots in the local environment, upload them to the server"
2011-10-22T18:43:40  <DataWraith> Yeah.
2011-10-22T18:43:49  <Alexer> but eventually the servers would crawl to a halt anyway as people upload real bots
2011-10-22T18:43:55  <a1k0n> i think the simulation is being done on EC2 instances anyway
2011-10-22T18:44:05  <DataWraith> dai-ra: With trueskill, the starter buts should be delegated to the lower ranks and fight among themselves. Those fights the server can quickly cut short.
2011-10-22T18:44:10  <DataWraith> *bots
2011-10-22T18:44:24  <a1k0n> so i think there's a technical solution to run the simulations faster.  whether there is a political/funding issue or not i can't say
2011-10-22T18:44:28  <jmcarthur> i agree, but one of the organizers is dead set on allowing people to get started with programming without having to install anything, hence the encouragement to just upload random stuff
2011-10-22T18:44:52  <jmcarthur> that was addressed to Alexer

2011-10-22T18:45:43  <Alexer> jmcarthur, but you have to install the local environment anyway, since testing your code on the official servers is slow (and stupid :D)
2011-10-22T18:46:09  <dai-ra> other option could be to disable bots of users who haven't check out their profile page in X hours. (or to even have a manual option for it)

2011-10-22T18:47:03  <Alexer> jmcarthur, having the real server be a tcp server with some servers running uploaded bots for people who don't want to install their own environment could work too *hinthint* ;)

2011-10-22T18:49:38  <jmcarthur> it's more fair if the official server keeps everybody on the same kind of hardware
2011-10-22T18:50:00  <Alexer> jmcarthur, of course if someone has monster hardware to run their bots on, they have more time to run their bot. then again, if someone uses c instead of python to code his bot, he has 20x more time to do calculations too ;)
2011-10-22T18:50:11  <jmcarthur> c vs python is a choice though

2011-10-22T18:50:57  <jmcarthur> DataWraith: right. the point of running the official server right now is for things like compatibility testing, not really so much ranking

2011-10-22T19:20:53  <Alexer> roflmao1, just run it normally, output your data to stderr and pass -eE to playgame.py
2011-10-22T19:20:57  <cirno_the_greate> you can write to stderr
2011-10-22T19:21:03  <roflmao1> ah gotcha

2011-10-22T19:30:54  <DataWraith> roflmao1: The server gets a zip with all your files.

2011-10-22T19:31:56  <Alexer> personally i rewrote ants.py so that you can inherit the bot from the Ants-class
2011-10-22T19:31:58  <soon> MyBot.ext is the main and only file that the server will execute, anything that you include within that file will be imported

2011-10-22T19:34:51  <DataWraith> Islacrusez: It hunts. Food. Unknown tiles. Not sure about other ants.
2011-10-22T19:35:02  <DataWraith> Islacrusez: I'd guess it's a python version issue again...
2011-10-22T19:35:12  <Islacrusez> well, these two just sat in the corner and refused to come out
2011-10-22T19:35:29  <DataWraith> Islacrusez: Hm. :/
2011-10-22T19:35:31  <Islacrusez> they went for the food, when they saw it, but not for anything else it seems

2011-10-22T19:36:00  <DataWraith> roflmao1: It saves what the server has told it so far.

2011-10-22T19:38:10  <DataWraith> roflmao1: Every ant can see a certain distance, the distance can be different in different games
2011-10-22T19:39:02  <DataWraith> roflmao1: The formula is on this page: http://aichallenge.org/specification.php
2011-10-22T19:39:11  <roflmao1> but how does the game engine prevent me from doing ant.square.neighbor(:E).neighbor(:E).neighbor(:E) ala infinity?

2011-10-22T19:41:47  <letmetellyou> i really should be studying for the AI class at Stanford, not screwing with AI challenge
2011-10-22T19:42:00  <roflmao> so all ants.rb really does is interpret text from the server
2011-10-22T19:42:02  <roflmao> nice
2011-10-22T19:43:03  <rr5> roflmao: Yep, you should read this: http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#Bot-Input
2011-10-22T19:43:11  <roflmao> you guys are awesome
2011-10-22T19:43:12  <swinejihad> are you taking the online class they offer?
2011-10-22T19:43:38  <rr5> and read_intro and read_turn in ants.rb
2011-10-22T19:43:44  <roflmao> right right right
2011-10-22T19:43:53  <roflmao> and ants.rb as I can see automatically stores shit into it's map var
2011-10-22T19:44:00  <roflmao> so I don't have to be saving what I discover rofl
2011-10-22T19:44:08  <roflmao> its*

2011-10-22T19:46:24  <roflmao> but i assume that's simply modifying the read input to get it in
2011-10-22T19:46:29  <roflmao> all that's required
2011-10-22T19:46:39  <DataWraith> roflmao: Yeah, and that regex, and clear the hills out like the food is cleared.
2011-10-22T19:46:47  <swinejihad> I'm not sure why they even have so many packages with such crippling errors
2011-10-22T19:46:49  <roflmao> doesn't the regex read it in?
2011-10-22T19:47:01  <roflmao> DataWraith you said you were using ruby?
2011-10-22T19:47:14  <DataWraith> The regex above the case statement prevents the 'h' from being parsed.
2011-10-22T19:47:16  <swinejihad> I had to fix my own java starter pack because it wasn't clearing the food

2011-10-22T19:49:00  <Alexer> DataWraith, i think fixes to the starter pack are okay :PP

2011-10-22T19:49:22  <DataWraith> Alexer: Yeah, but the entire file does contain some things from my bot...
2011-10-22T19:49:30  <Alexer> DataWraith, swinejihad: actually, if you have fixed things in the starter packs, you should probably make a pull request on github
2011-10-22T19:49:38  <Alexer> DataWraith, ah, okay then
2011-10-22T19:49:45  <DataWraith>  _, type, row, col, owner = *rd.match(/(w|f|a|d|h) (\d+) (\d+)(?: (\d+)|)/)
2011-10-22T19:50:00  <DataWraith> The |h in there needs to be added before you can add to the case statement.
2011-10-22T19:50:09  <Islacrusez> err, DataWraith, how do I run my bot?
2011-10-22T19:50:24  <roflmao> huh
2011-10-22T19:50:26  <roflmao> mine already has this: rd.match(/(w|f|h|a|d) (\d+) (\d+)(?: (\d+)|)/)
2011-10-22T19:50:36  <roflmao> maybe they already fixed it?
2011-10-22T19:50:40  <DataWraith> Hm, maybe it got fixed since I downloaded mine?

2011-10-22T19:50:47  <roflmao> apparently so
2011-10-22T19:51:03  <roflmao> someone needs to update the website then
2011-10-22T19:51:41  <swinejihad> I think it was already sometimes after I posted on the forums
2011-10-22T19:51:51  <DataWraith> Alexer: I thought about contributing changes to the Ruby starter, but I would probably have rewritten it from scratch... not even the indentation is proper...
2011-10-22T19:51:51  <swinejihad> I redownloaded the starterpack and didn't have the same problem
2011-10-22T19:52:13  <Alexer> DataWraith, hehe :D
2011-10-22T19:52:34  <DataWraith> No, seriously. The ruby community pretty much agrees that tabs are a bad idea in ruby code. ^^
2011-10-22T19:52:46  <Alexer> DataWraith, i prefer indenting with tabs (though the python recommendation is to use spaces), so i re-indented it too
2011-10-22T19:52:49  <roflmao> yeah this lib kind of sucks tbh :P
2011-10-22T19:52:52  <Alexer> and seriously rewrote it

2011-10-22T20:35:59  <SharkMonkey> cirno_the_greate, I'm thinking of switching to a statically typed language. Using python now.
2011-10-22T20:36:20  <SharkMonkey> I figure C++ will be too much headach
2011-10-22T20:36:37  <SharkMonkey> Haskell is looking attractive
2011-10-22T20:36:57  <Islacrusez> what's the best choice if I'm most familiar with AS2?
2011-10-22T20:37:09  <SharkMonkey> Islacrusez, javascript maybe?

2011-10-22T20:39:05  <cirno_the_greate> i'm newbie with haskell, and sometimes just running around with its pureness
2011-10-22T20:39:29  <SharkMonkey> Islacrusez, People say python is "executable psuedocode". I think that's too much of a stretch, but maybe you'll feel that way too.
2011-10-22T20:40:12  <Islacrusez> what's java like; ever used that?
2011-10-22T20:40:27  <cirno_the_greate> i think a little bit understand why you want to switch over python
2011-10-22T20:40:33  <cirno_the_greate> initially i wanted ruby
2011-10-22T20:40:47  <cirno_the_greate> but thought it's runtime could be a little bit slow
2011-10-22T20:41:08  <cirno_the_greate> Islacrusez: java not hard
2011-10-22T20:41:31  <swinejihad> java's boring but relatively fast and mature
2011-10-22T20:41:41  <Islacrusez> "boring"?
2011-10-22T20:42:07  <cirno_the_greate> like all other mainstream computer languages
2011-10-22T20:42:19  <cirno_the_greate> may be a little bit more boring than other
2011-10-22T20:42:31  <swinejihad> it's unexciting. It doesn't support a lot of particularly innovative features but it has IMO a very good OO system

2011-10-22T20:58:57  <avdg> or use other servers?

2011-10-22T21:00:30  <Xokker> my bot is second version
2011-10-22T21:00:42  <bobbydroptable> oh that may be why? :
2011-10-22T21:00:58  <bobbydroptable> to stop people from repeatedly submitting
2011-10-22T21:01:00  <bobbydroptable> maybe
2011-10-22T21:01:03  <keith_> my bot is like fifth version, because in several hours it didn't play a single game...was worried I was silently broken.
2011-10-22T21:01:13  <bobbydroptable> or maybe the server's just broken
2011-10-22T21:01:57  <bobbydroptable> just a thought, i think the game actually scales your timeout depending on the number of ants you have

2011-10-22T21:11:52  <bobbydroptable> avdg if it is a timeout, you will be able to see through the debugging messages where it's timing out
2011-10-22T21:12:03  <bobbydroptable> if it is an infinite loop
2011-10-22T21:12:14  <avdg> its simply harder to debug
2011-10-22T21:12:18  <bobbydroptable> honestly, i've not yet had to seriously optimise anything as of yet.

2011-10-22T21:57:04  <avdg> :-) I'm already trying to avoid recomputing, its a hard work
2011-10-22T21:57:11  <roflmao> as in if every turn all my ant objects are recreated
2011-10-22T21:57:21  <roflmao> they are new instances

2011-10-22T21:57:50  <roflmao> because for a* to work I need to store an array of "walked" tiles for the objective
2011-10-22T21:58:01  <roflmao> that gets updated every turn after an ant makes a move
2011-10-22T21:58:15  <roflmao> but since my ants are being reset by the framework, the walked tiles multi-dimensional array is always empty

2011-10-22T21:59:19  <doh_> roflmao - the problem isn't overly difficult, but each round you have to map your ants to their new location.
2011-10-22T21:59:39  <doh_> I use the ants from the framework (tiles with MY_ANTS) to update my own data structure.

2011-10-22T22:00:17  <roflmao> basically I'm going to have to rewrite the way the framework reads in the data
2011-10-22T22:00:19  <roflmao> which kind of sucks

2011-10-22T22:36:10  <doh_> it will because A* is not 'building' a route.

2011-10-22T22:37:07  <doh_> hence, you'll walk to every part of the wall before finding the first tile that moves you around it.

2011-10-22T22:37:56  <doh_> think of depth first search
2011-10-22T22:38:13  <doh_> you prune off branches when you know you're 'broken'
2011-10-22T22:38:36  <doh_> A*'s heurisitic (manhatten distance) let's you prune sooner.
2011-10-22T22:38:48  <roflmao> ah, right, so S W S E E N N W would be one of the branches
2011-10-22T22:38:54  <roflmao> but since it breaks it would be pruned off by the algorithm
2011-10-22T22:38:56  <doh_> yes.
2011-10-22T22:39:00  <roflmao> DUH
2011-10-22T22:39:14  <roflmao> thank you sir for pointing out this very obvious fact
2011-10-22T22:39:35  <doh_> no problem. I spent most of yesterday screaming at my A* implementation.
2011-10-22T22:39:48  <roflmao> so yes ideally you go to square that takes you closest to objective square based on manhatten distance
2011-10-22T22:39:53  <roflmao> but that could lead you to a dead end
2011-10-22T22:40:04  <roflmao> so you have to explore all branches to find the most optimal solution that doesn't dead end
2011-10-22T22:40:08  <roflmao> gotcha
2011-10-22T22:41:02  <doh_> I originally thought 'fixup' path planning would work better (go until you can't, then plot path around)

2011-10-22T22:41:45  <roflmao> a* works great but I definitely now see why you must calculate the full path apriori and can't just go following the "fix it" way
2011-10-22T22:41:53  <roflmao> cause the potential for dead ends is ENORMOUS
2011-10-22T22:42:37  <doh_> i think so on mazes, but you might have a computational advantage on maps with fewer 'deadends'

2011-10-22T23:24:07  <avdg> (including most overhead)
2011-10-22T23:24:16  <Alexer> avdg, i found a stuck instance of my bot at some point, that had been using the processor for 4 hours at 100% utilization.
2011-10-22T23:24:24  <Alexer> avdg, it was using 10GB of memory :D

2011-10-22T23:26:12  <avdg> nice
2011-10-22T23:26:36  <otzi> is there an enforced memory limit?

2011-10-22T23:39:14  <SharkMonkey> Is the chance of timing out cpu dependent?
2011-10-22T23:39:46  <SharkMonkey> Is my bot more likely to timeout on a netbook atom processor than it is on a high end server?
2011-10-22T23:40:05  *** djr__ <djr__!~djr@66.242.210.178> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-22T23:40:11  <msk> isn't timeout 1 second by default?
2011-10-22T23:40:59  <SharkMonkey> The starter kits seem to check for one second and then abandons ship.
2011-10-22T23:41:35  <avdg> hmm, it looks like my bot consumes 18mb of memory, but reserved 100mb memory
2011-10-22T23:41:43  <ashoka> SharkMonkey : yes, your assumption is correct.
2011-10-22T23:43:52  <SharkMonkey> Thanks ashoka
2011-10-22T23:44:00  <ashoka> SharkMonkey : from the code, you should capture the bot input for turntime, record the turn start time, then do the math and get the remaining time. then the code can appropriately exit b4 it times out. that seems to be the only reliable way.

2011-10-22T23:54:57  <McLeopold> hi all
2011-10-22T23:54:57  <janzert> that only just gets the one worker back up, not a fix to pairing so we can get more workers going again :/
2011-10-22T23:55:10  <a1k0n> how many workers are there?
2011-10-22T23:55:14  <janzert> Yay, and here's the guy that can fix the latter
2011-10-22T23:55:15  <a1k0n> (normally)
2011-10-22T23:55:21  <jtamer> hey guys, i can't figure out what the ranges for the setup parameters are. for example, attackradius2. is this always set to the same value? if so, what is the value?
2011-10-22T23:55:25  <McLeopold> janzert: did you do any patches?
2011-10-22T23:55:29  <jtamer> and if not, what are the min and max values?
2011-10-22T23:55:41  <janzert> not at the moment
2011-10-22T23:55:55  <janzert> working on tracking down another worker exception though
2011-10-22T23:55:59  <avdg> jtamer: did you read the game spec?
2011-10-22T23:56:05  <janzert> the one in the matchup table
2011-10-22T23:56:16  <jtamer> avdg: i did, yes. i read that the value will be passed in during setup.
2011-10-22T23:56:18  <janzert> oh, did I do any

2011-10-22T23:56:56  <McLeopold> I'll start to dive into getting a fix soon.  Probably an hour before I have something working
2011-10-22T23:57:02  <janzert> ok
2011-10-22T23:57:03  <jtamer> i mean, can attackradius2 = a million?
2011-10-22T23:57:11  <avdg> jtamer: just sqrt the value
2011-10-22T23:57:17  <avdg> I think that should be enough
2011-10-22T23:57:17  <janzert> I'd like to hear what is going wrong when you get a chance to
2011-10-22T23:57:19  <jtamer> avdg: i don't think you're understanding my question
2011-10-22T23:57:36  <janzert> I tracked it down to problems in the picking out the rest of the players stage
2011-10-22T23:57:49  <janzert> but didn't narrow it beyond that point
2011-10-22T23:58:08  <jtamer> avdg: i know that my bot will see the value for the setup parameters. but *I* want to know it so that i can program the bot better
2011-10-22T23:58:42  <janzert> jtamer: take a look at http://aichallenge.org/game_settings.php
2011-10-22T23:58:46  <ashoka> jtamer : so far attackradius has been 5.
2011-10-22T23:58:49  <a1k0n> jtamer: i highly doubt it will ever change from the one value but it's possible some maps might have slightly a different one
