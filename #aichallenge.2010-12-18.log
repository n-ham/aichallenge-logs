2010-12-18T03:40:31  <antimatroid> i swear i'm not using any pointers :
2010-12-18T03:40:48  <antimatroid> i'm thinking somethings happening with my streams
2010-12-18T03:40:53  <antimatroid> it's a huge jumble of mess for that
2010-12-18T03:42:11  <antimatroid> sigh: interested in taking a look? :P
2010-12-18T03:42:21  <antimatroid> you get to watch the game play too
2010-12-18T03:42:27  <antimatroid> only an ascii version of it though
2010-12-18T03:42:29  <sigh> let valgrind look at it first

2010-12-18T03:45:56  <delt0r___> Frontier: I don't really support ants (am working on something else right now), and i only have 1 process per player. Also all the source is in the download
2010-12-18T03:52:02  <antimatroid> just cleaning up something i can zip
2010-12-18T03:52:30  <sigh> setup a public repo already :P
2010-12-18T03:57:13  <antimatroid> meh, google docs will do for the moment
2010-12-18T03:58:32  <antimatroid> i've included an arena folder, hopefully you should be able to cd there and then just enter
2010-12-18T03:58:32  <antimatroid> engine.exe "amap.txt" "receiver.exe" "bot.exe" "bot.exe" "6" "50" "1.1"
2010-12-18T03:58:43  <antimatroid> https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B5joEFt1EpwZZjZiN2M0NjUtZDY4Yy00M2YyLThlYjYtMGFiZThiZmEyMzY5&sort=name&layout=list&num=50
2010-12-18T04:00:44  <antimatroid> the code for engine is horrible
2010-12-18T04:00:58  <antimatroid> but i think it's at least spaced out to make sense for what spots are doing what
2010-12-18T04:01:18  <sigh> is there a makefile or something?
2010-12-18T04:01:30  <antimatroid> i have no idea how to write them, sorry :P
2010-12-18T04:02:05  <antimatroid> i could rezip with codeblocks project files?
2010-12-18T04:03:45  <sigh> hmmm
2010-12-18T04:05:29  <sigh> mah... there's a bunch of windows stuff that isn't protected by ifdefs
2010-12-18T04:05:44  <antimatroid> is it just #include "windows.h"?
2010-12-18T04:05:50  <antimatroid> i couldn't work out how to not have that outside
2010-12-18T04:06:17  <antimatroid> otherwise,ahhhh crap
2010-12-18T04:10:59  <sigh> Process.cc:67: warning: missing sentinel in function call

2010-12-18T04:11:21  <delt0r___> the joys of C++
2010-12-18T04:11:38  <antimatroid> hmm, i didn't write that
2010-12-18T04:11:54  <antimatroid> SmkMnstr: you about?
2010-12-18T04:13:19  <sigh> nvm, I fixed it
2010-12-18T04:13:37  <antimatroid> did it fully compile? because that should be the only problemish part
2010-12-18T04:13:44  <antimatroid> well, and it running as expected
2010-12-18T04:14:55  <sigh> ok, I got it compile
2010-12-18T04:15:33  <antimatroid> i think i left the outputting of an ant square to debug.txt as broken, but that doesn't really matter
2010-12-18T04:15:57  <antimatroid> game.txt contains almost full information of the board at each state (don't see harvest or hp etc.)
2010-12-18T04:16:29  <antimatroid> uncomment lines 137-139 of Engine.cc if you want to see what is in game.txt to the console each turn
2010-12-18T04:17:27  <Frontier> antimatroid: If you have a replay file for me that would be great. Something that includes all the special cases as well.
2010-12-18T04:17:29  <sigh> it seems to be running
2010-12-18T04:18:37  <sigh> ok, it ran :)
2010-12-18T04:19:12  <antimatroid> Frontier: just a minute
2010-12-18T04:19:18  <antimatroid> sigh: it's slow as fuck aye :P
2010-12-18T04:19:24  <sigh> yeah
2010-12-18T04:19:56  <antimatroid> Frontier: are you taking the final line
2010-12-18T04:19:56  <antimatroid> fin winner
2010-12-18T04:19:56  <antimatroid> atm?
2010-12-18T04:20:48  <antimatroid> Frontier: http://pastebin.com/T4xZYmRd
2010-12-18T04:20:53  <antimatroid> you may want to edit/remove that last line
2010-12-18T04:21:17  <antimatroid> oh, and did you want direction for walk?
2010-12-18T04:21:23  <antimatroid> i gave it to you
2010-12-18T04:22:33  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/2UNY4Nrf
2010-12-18T04:22:44  <antimatroid> that's the format i currently pass to the visualiser with
2010-12-18T04:22:48  <Frontier> antimatroid: At the moment I'm not taking any of that ^^. I thought it would be wise to wait till you have something that works for you.
2010-12-18T04:23:20  <antimatroid> (i think) take a look at that sample file and see if it matches
2010-12-18T04:24:03  <antimatroid> sigh: i have a feeling i made more of a mess with string streams than just taking a char at a time, i may try changing all that after and see if it changes anything
2010-12-18T04:24:13  <Frontier> That's difficult to see. In the specs the direction is given twice for "walk"
2010-12-18T04:24:35  <antimatroid> ??
2010-12-18T04:25:06  <Frontier> Round 1 and 3 both have a direction field, but it should always be the same, correct?
2010-12-18T04:25:26  <antimatroid> i have a feeling i'm not sending you walk rotation moves till later
2010-12-18T04:25:35  <antimatroid> i can fix that
2010-12-18T04:26:20  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm currently only sending you walk information at round 3, including rotation
2010-12-18T04:28:01  <antimatroid> i found a neat little trick for the starter bot home path, assing each square a direction home, start them all at 'X', and every time an ant move into a square with 'X', mark the direction that to which you just came from, then any ant of yours has a (very inefficient) path back to base mapped out
2010-12-18T04:28:46  <Frontier> I see. I get the initial rotation from the "A" lines so I don't need any for turn 1, but on turn 2 following it would be good to have the direction for attacks/walk so that the visualization makes sense
2010-12-18T04:29:48  <antimatroid> wait, is for each start ant meant to be just at turn 0, or every turn?
2010-12-18T04:29:49  <Frontier> antimatroid: I think the starter bot is coming along fine :p.
2010-12-18T04:30:12  <Frontier> only turn 0
2010-12-18T04:30:16  <antimatroid> okay good
2010-12-18T04:30:47  <Frontier> it's just so I have something to initialize the graphics with.
2010-12-18T04:30:47  <antimatroid> then round 1, i send you info about deposit and attack rotations atm, then round 3 walk rotation information (and walk information)
2010-12-18T04:31:18  <antimatroid> i don't give you any information about spawning ants either, can you just do it if there is grains on a home base after round 2?
2010-12-18T04:31:20  <Frontier> ok that is probably better than a separate rotation line anyway
2010-12-18T04:32:10  <Frontier> You don't give me a changed square for a spawning ant? Ok, I think I can write a quick hack for that.
2010-12-18T04:32:47  <antimatroid> i do give you a changed square for it, but i'm not sure if you wanted to animate the spawn before resolving conflicts?
2010-12-18T04:32:55  <antimatroid> you get information about that square after the resolution
2010-12-18T04:34:00  <antimatroid> sigh: how does the example game look? :P
2010-12-18T04:34:34  <antimatroid> Frontier: http://pastebin.com/TszZfnhe
2010-12-18T04:34:42  <antimatroid> that's what an ascii example game looks like
2010-12-18T04:40:58  <antimatroid> i'll have a play around with popen in python later and see if i can't get that working
2010-12-18T04:41:40  <antimatroid> did any of you ever play future cop lapd?
2010-12-18T04:42:19  <antimatroid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2rPuRDtL_s
2010-12-18T04:42:29  <antimatroid> that should jog your memory, that is what i think my ant game feels like
2010-12-18T04:43:19  <Frontier> antimatroid: I can still animate the spawn of ants by adding the animation to the previous turn ;)   And no, I never played future cop lapd. I liked to play the demo of this game, though: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWsywyJtjA
2010-12-18T04:43:27  <sigh> what are you getting working in python?
2010-12-18T04:44:22  <antimatroid> sigh: possibly something cleaner
2010-12-18T04:45:00  <sigh> might want to look at the ai contest repo then... the SadBox class there does all the process talky stuff

2010-12-18T07:11:40  <antimatroid> and any idea how i can get the one file to compile across systems? ie. how do you put in #include "windows.h" when you need that for the #ifdef
2010-12-18T07:13:09  <sigh> just put the #include "windows.h" inside a #ifdef _WIN32
2010-12-18T07:13:54  <sigh> also had to change the last arg to execl in Process.cc:67 from 0 to NULL
2010-12-18T07:14:29  <antimatroid> then it doesn't compile :P
2010-12-18T07:14:46  <antimatroid> i think it needs that to have _WIN32 be defined
2010-12-18T07:14:52  <antimatroid> hence why i had it outside there
2010-12-18T07:15:38  <sigh> then how does Process.cc work? it uses #ifdef _WIN32
2010-12-18T07:16:07  <antimatroid> yes, but if i move the include windows.h it falls through to the #else
2010-12-18T07:16:57  <antimatroid> wait, neverming, got it

2010-12-18T07:37:01  <antimatroid> that's a very basic 30 turn sample game
2010-12-18T07:37:30  <Frontier> antimatroid: ...that is not a very good sample to get the idea what the game is like ^^
2010-12-18T07:37:38  <antimatroid> players bases are indicated start with 9 grains and an ant on them, then you need to go harvest grains and deposit them at home for more ants to be spawned
2010-12-18T07:37:52  <antimatroid> Frontier: it's sort of the best i have atm :P
2010-12-18T07:38:07  <antimatroid> if one scrolls down they can see the ants spreading out
2010-12-18T07:38:52  <antimatroid> it works better when the console is printing it in the same position every second
2010-12-18T07:39:00  <Frontier> if one scrolls in sync to the monitor to get the shutter effect... maybe :p

2010-12-18T08:03:30  <Frontier> that sounds good, sizes will also be from 16 to 32, right?
2010-12-18T08:03:41  <antimatroid> i was doing 40x40 atm
2010-12-18T08:04:25  <antimatroid> people like maxing at 32 don't they?
2010-12-18T08:04:47  <Frontier> I can't fit that on a laptop monitor with 1280x800 as long as I make a square 20x20 px.

2010-12-18T08:06:57  <Frontier> it is about the size of the planetwars visualizer then
2010-12-18T08:08:12  <Frontier> I thought about adding a border to the map, so you can see what is happening behind the wrap
2010-12-18T08:08:27  <antimatroid> so repeating data?
2010-12-18T08:08:47  <antimatroid> might just be more confusing i think
2010-12-18T08:09:17  <Frontier> Right, but shaded darker so you can distinguish it from the 'real' map
2010-12-18T08:09:42  <antimatroid> maybe worth a shot, although if the map could be bigger, i'd probably prefer to do it with new squares :P
2010-12-18T08:10:31  <Frontier> Well I guess I could always zoom out the canvas until it fits the screen :p
2010-12-18T08:10:51  <antimatroid> that's possibly not such a bad idea if easy enough :P
2010-12-18T08:11:02  <antimatroid> we can still use smaller dimensions if it's considered better
2010-12-18T08:11:40  <Frontier> I don't know if I get bad ass drawing artifacts from the fractional coordinates though
2010-12-18T08:12:09  <antimatroid> i think it looks pretty good atm size wise
2010-12-18T08:12:17  <antimatroid> i wouldn't want to make them much smaller for readability
2010-12-18T08:13:11  <Frontier> how long do you gess a game of 40x40 could be?
2010-12-18T08:13:18  <Frontier> *guess
2010-12-18T08:13:23  <antimatroid> probably too long
2010-12-18T08:14:17  <antimatroid> my intentions are for the games to be along the lines of
2010-12-18T08:14:18  <antimatroid> go out and discover the map and build up grains on the home base for army
2010-12-18T08:14:18  <antimatroid> big epic battle as players try to invade each others bases and defend
2010-12-18T08:14:54  <Frontier> epic... well, how can I help in making it epic?
2010-12-18T08:15:03  <Frontier> explosions?
2010-12-18T08:15:23  <Frontier> metal shreds flying through the air?
2010-12-18T08:15:38  <Frontier> ant sounds?
2010-12-18T08:16:14  <antimatroid> hmmm, not sure
2010-12-18T08:16:26  <antimatroid> my thoughts are mostly on the strategy being interesting
2010-12-18T08:17:09  <antimatroid> i think the optimal thing to do when multiple opponent ants are near each other switches all over the place here
2010-12-18T08:17:24  <antimatroid> which is what i think gives it the same kind of strategic complexity that tron and planet wars had
2010-12-18T08:17:55  <antimatroid> you could maybe have ants that land on the same square do some kind of fight animation?
2010-12-18T08:18:16  <antimatroid> and if an ant moves onto the enemies base, explode the base and all ants?
2010-12-18T08:18:33  <Frontier> That is the most difficult situation because they actually just disapear as soon as they get there :p
2010-12-18T08:19:20  <antimatroid> to the enemies base? ah yeah, you would need to do it once being sent fin i think
2010-12-18T08:19:36  <antimatroid> i think it's best if you move there their ant spawns before collision fights/fusion
2010-12-18T08:20:23  <Frontier> ...no I mean when ants move onto the same square I cannot do play an animation as they just get merged
2010-12-18T08:20:43  <antimatroid> i send you the move information at round 3, then updated square information in round 4
2010-12-18T08:20:48  <antimatroid> couldn't you do it between those two rounds?
2010-12-18T08:21:23  <antimatroid> that's why i'm doing those rounds, so we can see the ants move on top of each other before the morph
2010-12-18T08:21:43  <Frontier> antimatroid: Actually I'm still trying to get the movement smooth so I recombine all rounds into one. If you really insist I can split it up again.
2010-12-18T08:22:00  <antimatroid> it's your choice :)
2010-12-18T08:22:09  <antimatroid> but i think it's better if we can see what each ant did
2010-12-18T08:22:34  <antimatroid> actually, no do it smoothly
2010-12-18T08:22:40  <antimatroid> your way is better :)
2010-12-18T08:22:51  <antimatroid> cause we will still see them walk etc. yeah?
2010-12-18T08:22:52  <Frontier> Well you see that. The two ants move onto one square.... and then *pop* they are one.
2010-12-18T08:22:59  <antimatroid> yeah, that's cool
2010-12-18T08:23:16  <antimatroid> the smooth flow of the game looks really good, same with planet wars
2010-12-18T08:24:16  <Frontier> It just needs the little bit of extra information, like the direction an ant is facing, btw. do you add the direction to the "S" lines of round ...what was it 1? now?
2010-12-18T08:25:41  <antimatroid> round 1: directions ants face for attacks and deposits
2010-12-18T08:25:41  <antimatroid> round 2: new information for squares after attacks, harvests and deposits
2010-12-18T08:25:41  <antimatroid> round 3: directions for ants walking (implement these walk moves)
2010-12-18T08:25:41  <antimatroid> round 4: information for squares changed after walks/spawning/conflicts
2010-12-18T08:26:03  <antimatroid> round 1 is "R", rounds 2 and 4 are "S" and round 3 is "W"
2010-12-18T08:26:37  <antimatroid> R row column direction
2010-12-18T08:26:37  <antimatroid> W row column direction
2010-12-18T08:26:38  <antimatroid> S row column antPlayer antHP antHarvest squareGrains
2010-12-18T08:26:40  <Frontier> hmm, ok. just thought that round 1 and 3 share the same information
2010-12-18T08:27:09  <antimatroid> no, i don't process walk moves until after round 2, because an ant that dies from an attack doesn't move
2010-12-18T08:27:10  <Frontier> wait... you wont send a round 3 for an ant that has a round 1, right?
2010-12-18T08:27:17  <antimatroid> no i wont
2010-12-18T08:27:41  <Frontier> ok. this is gonna be a mess of a source code :p
2010-12-18T08:27:54  <antimatroid> should i be doing that differently?
2010-12-18T08:28:10  <antimatroid> otherwise you will see an ant walk that dies before walking
2010-12-18T08:28:15  <Frontier> no im happy we have something we can agree on.
2010-12-18T08:29:06  <antimatroid> i'm flexible, i just need to be convinced another way is better :)
2010-12-18T08:29:08  <Frontier> i think it would be easier for me if i could identify the objects as ants, not as "square x changed".
2010-12-18T08:29:21  <antimatroid> if i am convinced a particular way works best, i get really stubborn
2010-12-18T08:29:37  <antimatroid> what id do fused ants get?
2010-12-18T08:30:03  <Frontier> I had a stubborn co-worker. Since then I don't agrue any more.
2010-12-18T08:30:18  <antimatroid> i enjoy a good argument :(
2010-12-18T08:30:53  <Frontier> fused ants... hmm... good question. Is it maybe a new ant that just spawned there?
2010-12-18T08:32:10  <antimatroid> that could possibly be done
2010-12-18T08:32:12  <Frontier> the ant id would be lastId+1
2010-12-18T08:32:15  <antimatroid> is it really getting easier if i do that? :P
2010-12-18T08:33:15  <antimatroid> if it makes your life easier i can do it
2010-12-18T08:33:19  <Frontier> I don't want to check 1000 squares to find 20 ants that I want to draw, so I use a list of ants anyway internally
2010-12-18T08:33:22  <antimatroid> but i think it makes both the engine and bot's life harder
2010-12-18T08:33:54  <Frontier> Right now when I manage the animations I have to track back origin squares and stuff like that ^^
2010-12-18T08:34:21  <antimatroid> hmmm
2010-12-18T08:34:37  <Frontier> How do you handle that internally? Do you iterate over every square to find own ants in the bot?
2010-12-18T08:35:06  <antimatroid> i think i do in the engine atm, some places i store a vector of locations to squares with ants
2010-12-18T08:35:12  <antimatroid> i really need to clean everything up
2010-12-18T08:35:15  <antimatroid> i can do ant ids
2010-12-18T08:35:17  <antimatroid> i'll do that
2010-12-18T08:35:24  <Frontier> hehe, ok
2010-12-18T08:35:31  <antimatroid> you respecify gui input and i'll do it to that
2010-12-18T08:39:38  <Frontier> Now I have to make sure I don't end up with a bunch of helper functions again, in other words get it right on the first try. hmm a special "spawn" and "die" command probably. even attack, deposit and harvest could be used for some basic animation.
2010-12-18T08:45:28  <antimatroid> i can send you all made moves, but you will get more information
2010-12-18T08:45:56  <antimatroid> or do you want to also process moves yourself?
2010-12-18T08:48:42  <Frontier> no, i would like to let the server handle the numbers.
2010-12-18T08:50:20  <antimatroid> actually, i don't send you any more information
2010-12-18T08:50:44  <antimatroid> and it's almost no difference, i just split R lines up into D and A
2010-12-18T08:50:49  <Frontier> i'll take your word on that
2010-12-18T08:50:50  <antimatroid> actually, i also need to send you H lines
2010-12-18T08:51:07  <antimatroid> wait a sec
2010-12-18T08:51:36  <Frontier> no, you should wait now, im in the middle of refining the input format :p
2010-12-18T08:51:56  <antimatroid> okay :)
2010-12-18T08:52:21  <antimatroid> but split round one up into lines starting with 'A', 'D' and 'H' ;)
2010-12-18T08:54:40  <Frontier> Stupid question: Do I need to think in rounds when I merge them all to have a smooth movement?
2010-12-18T08:56:09  <antimatroid> ?
2010-12-18T08:57:18  <antimatroid> an ant should be able to deposit before dying from attack
2010-12-18T08:57:21  <antimatroid> i have that wrong atm
2010-12-18T08:57:21  <Frontier> I might be doing it wrong, but I don't see a need for this abstraction in my visualizer right now
2010-12-18T08:57:42  <Frontier> deposit before attack... hmm

2010-12-18T09:15:17  <antimatroid> can move be walk?
2010-12-18T09:15:25  <antimatroid> i like to call all options a move
2010-12-18T09:15:32  <Frontier> oh yes, sure
2010-12-18T09:15:43  <antimatroid> i think it makes it clearer
2010-12-18T09:15:50  <antimatroid> alright, give me a little while :)
2010-12-18T09:16:07  <antimatroid> should bots receive ant ids?
2010-12-18T09:16:42  <antimatroid> what's the point of providing a spawn direction on an ant?
2010-12-18T09:17:16  <antimatroid> can you just set it as north and south for each bot and not receive that info?
2010-12-18T09:23:17  <antimatroid> Frontier: do you want ant id's to be unique for each player or for all ants?
2010-12-18T09:23:17  <Frontier> I could do that, but it adds control to the way the ants start out
2010-12-18T09:23:53  <Frontier> antimatroid: I had the same question a few days back. It doesn't really matter, but make them global.
2010-12-18T09:24:10  <antimatroid> i'm wondering how large that may get
2010-12-18T09:24:16  <Frontier> This way we can later add the brain bug, that assimilates enemy ants.
2010-12-18T09:24:54  <Frontier> I hope it gets smaller this way :p
2010-12-18T09:24:54  <antimatroid> you can't have more ants than total starting grains + 2
2010-12-18T09:24:59  <antimatroid> we can cap that if necessary
2010-12-18T09:26:22  <Frontier> antimatroid: As a means to make the game replays smaller you can cap the number. Let's see how much data the starter bot produces on a 32x32 map :)
2010-12-18T09:26:52  <antimatroid> okay, i still need to work out what is causing memory leak issues
2010-12-18T09:27:14  <antimatroid> and i'm hoping that is what causes it to get slower and not the more ants
2010-12-18T09:27:17  <Frontier> use valgrind it helped me a lot
2010-12-18T09:27:24  <antimatroid> the bot still seems to return it's moves fairly fast
2010-12-18T09:27:58  <Frontier> as long as it doesn't run O^3 loops its going to stay this way :)
2010-12-18T09:29:00  <antimatroid> there are a lot of cool algorithms for painting a discrete grid
2010-12-18T09:29:08  <antimatroid> cool == simple
2010-12-18T09:29:36  <antimatroid> what do you think starting hp of an ant should be?
2010-12-18T09:29:44  <antimatroid> it's currently 5 and i think that's about right

2010-12-18T09:32:06  <Frontier> Difficult to say. I'm more worried about the relation to the 'instagibs' when two ants walk onto the same square :D
2010-12-18T09:34:14  <Frontier> Look how the new format is smaller! Old: "W 28 11 N; S 27 11 1 5 0 8", new: "W 0 N"
2010-12-18T09:36:53  <antimatroid> it's harder to process
2010-12-18T09:37:15  <antimatroid> when an ant walks onto a square, i now need to track how many walked on and the id if it was just a single ant
2010-12-18T09:37:15  <Frontier> update M -> W, S -> G (was used twice): http://pastebin.com/0d0VmH7u
2010-12-18T09:37:42  <antimatroid> i should be able to do it thought
2010-12-18T09:39:15  <Frontier> didn't you have to merge any number of ants on a square before?
2010-12-18T09:44:29  <Frontier> the ids are new, thats true. but it really helps me a lot to know where the life of an ant starts and where it ends. I can now combine two walk commands to a curve so the ants don't always turn in 90°.
2010-12-18T09:45:49  <antimatroid> before i just took in new ant info for hp and grains from both players, then  combined that with spawned info and saw which player still had an ant there if any
2010-12-18T09:46:02  <antimatroid> i just need to tweak it to count the number of ants added
2010-12-18T09:46:13  <antimatroid> and create a new ant id if it's more than 1
2010-12-18T09:46:47  <antimatroid> any direction i pass you for spawned ants is going to be arbitrary though
2010-12-18T09:48:15  <Frontier> then drop that field for now. I'll see how I can use the new ant ID (!!) to find the direction the ant will use next

2010-12-18T09:49:14  <Frontier> Can you tell the bots if they won or lost and let them return a victory dance command?
2010-12-18T09:49:42  <Frontier> jeesh did I really propose that?
2010-12-18T09:50:58  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't think that's necessary :P
2010-12-18T09:51:10  <antimatroid> you could actually do a victory dance with this though
2010-12-18T09:53:52  <Frontier> use F for ants spawned by fusions instead of S. I might want to visualize that case differently
2010-12-18T09:54:06  <antimatroid> hmmm i was just about to say
2010-12-18T09:54:17  <antimatroid> when i spawn an ant, i do that before collisions
2010-12-18T09:54:31  <antimatroid> so if i assign that an id, then it collides, i assign another id
2010-12-18T09:55:29  <antimatroid> meaning ids may get used and never even appear
2010-12-18T09:55:31  <Frontier> so... an enemy ant can stand on my base, it spawns a new ant, they collide and my ant 'survives' with 1hp
2010-12-18T09:56:10  <antimatroid> i'm not doing it like that atm at all
2010-12-18T09:56:25  <Frontier> so what case did you think of?

2010-12-18T09:56:54  <antimatroid> then spawn and move ant info goes to that, and square info for actual ants that move gets cleared, then i resolve it all in one sweep
2010-12-18T09:57:41  <antimatroid> i can maybe do a little hack
2010-12-18T09:57:58  <antimatroid> assign newID -1 to a spawned ant, and if that is the carry over ID for 1 new ant, assign a new ID
2010-12-18T10:00:03  <Frontier> can you print the command sequence I would receive for this?

2010-12-18T10:00:31  <antimatroid> this is just me thinking out loud how i can resolve it
2010-12-18T10:01:23  <Frontier> so when an ant spawns and it survives the collision it will show as spawned in the usual way using "S"?
2010-12-18T10:01:36  <Frontier> instead of "S" "K" "F"
2010-12-18T10:01:41  <antimatroid> hmmm
2010-12-18T10:01:45  <antimatroid> i haven't got that far yet
2010-12-18T10:01:53  <antimatroid> i'm trying to assign ants an id
2010-12-18T10:01:53  <Frontier> that's what I was asking :p
2010-12-18T10:02:28  <antimatroid> i don't see why an ant needs an id?
2010-12-18T10:02:34  <Frontier> We don't need to create any new id for fusions as long as max one of them always survives and all others die
2010-12-18T10:03:16  <antimatroid> Frontier: which one gets to keep id? and then i need to store information about all ants that get added
2010-12-18T10:03:22  <antimatroid> it really does make it quite a lot harder my end
2010-12-18T10:04:33  <Frontier> yeah forget that idea. The id is usefull to refer to in the replay and for me to keep track of an ant.
2010-12-18T10:06:32  <antimatroid> actually, i do the spawning after doing all moves, i know if it's the only ant i add to the base
2010-12-18T10:06:39  <antimatroid> therefore i can tell whether i need to assign a ned id
2010-12-18T10:06:41  <antimatroid> problem averted :)
2010-12-18T10:06:53  <antimatroid> you get a brand new id if any ants land together though
2010-12-18T10:07:53  <Frontier> no problem. the only effect would have been that you see the stronger of two ants 'rush through'
2010-12-18T10:08:33  <antimatroid> you can have up to 6 ants end up on a square at once
2010-12-18T10:08:39  <antimatroid> 5 for normal, 6 on a base

2010-12-18T10:24:43  <antimatroid> ah crap, i need to track id's to kill as well

2010-12-18T10:25:14  <Frontier> you can, but if you find that you know what kind it is at the particular code line i can visualize them differently. that said it works with only "S" of course
2010-12-18T10:25:48  <antimatroid> hmmm, i'll see what i end up with
2010-12-18T10:25:58  <antimatroid> it just got even messier :P
2010-12-18T10:26:46  <Frontier> I try to swallow the guilt feelings :D
2010-12-18T10:27:28  <Frontier> You haven't worked with databases a lot have you?
2010-12-18T10:28:09  <antimatroid> i have to add ants to a square, then if ants added == 1 and home base has more than 1 grains and no ant is current there after moves, spawn a new and with a new id otherwise if there are grains spawn an ant without a new id, then i need to do collision detections on all that, and send you ids for any ants that die and spawning of any new ones whether through collisions or spawning a new one
2010-12-18T10:28:17  <antimatroid> no, i haven't :P
2010-12-18T10:28:28  <antimatroid> more than 0 grains*
2010-12-18T10:28:39  <antimatroid> i'm not sure this is going to help with my efficiency problem either :P

2010-12-18T10:30:50  <Frontier> that sounds complicated... i hope it is a lot simpler in reality. if it helps just spawn the ant, let it die in the collision and spawn a new ant if some hp remain for one player
2010-12-18T10:32:37  <Frontier> so you can end each processing state with a command (spawn, kill+spawn) instead of keeping all the information till the end of the pipeline, just to save an extra id
2010-12-18T10:34:08  <antimatroid> the point is i'm currenty
2010-12-18T10:34:19  <antimatroid> oops that was meant to be backspace not enter :)

2010-12-18T10:46:31  <antimatroid> and i've also got the issue that i need to deposit to a base before an ant, otherwise an ant before a square
2010-12-18T10:48:16  <rabidus> do you need some help
2010-12-18T10:48:27  <antimatroid> it's a bit messy atm :)

2010-12-18T10:49:25  <rabidus> k
2010-12-18T10:52:39  <antimatroid> Frontier: i really don't get how having ant ids helps you, don't you only need to redraw a square you get updated information?
2010-12-18T10:53:02  <antimatroid> i am going to have to restructure quite a lot of things i think
2010-12-18T10:58:16  <antimatroid> Frontier: i can do what you want, but it basically requires a complete rewrite of the engine and bots
2010-12-18T10:58:23  <antimatroid> i kind of wish i had that spec a couple of days ago
2010-12-18T10:59:38  <antimatroid> if i do it with waht i currently have i'm just going to be adding a bunch of hackish things all over the place
2010-12-18T10:59:45  <antimatroid> which is a really bad idea

2010-12-18T11:28:36  <Frontier> antimatroid: :-/
2010-12-18T11:35:22  <Frontier> It seems the hacks are either on your side or on my side. Maybe we can have half the amount of hacks on each side or so. I'm animating ants, not squares. With the first specs I had the same problem as you have now. Around 5 different cases that have to be handled in the correct order referencing future and past turns to figure out if the appearal of an ant on a square is not a regular spawn, but an ant that moved there from
2010-12-18T11:35:22  <Frontier> or the result of a collision. If I only render squares I would have to touch squares that I currently don't redraw seperately at all. Only when the grains on a square change I update the whole row once (z-order).
2010-12-18T11:38:26  <Frontier> I'd like to have an ant walking E,N in succession to walk in a curve instead of what the visualizer currently shows (90° instant turn). With an id I can easily look the two turns ahead.

2010-12-18T20:41:09  <antimatroid> Frontier: i'm unsure about waht changes i should make, with your new specification i almost feel like i should do a complete rewrite
2010-12-18T20:41:23  <antimatroid> which is a little annoying, cause i could have done done it like this a couple of days ago when we decided on a format
2010-12-18T20:50:44  <Frontier> Hey, you just asked me, what I would have changed about the format. Let's go back to the point where I said I don't argue. So just replace the id with col, row and change whatever you need to change as long as I can reconstruct an id from the data.
2010-12-18T20:54:24  <antimatroid> nah, tis all good, i'm about halfway through doing them i think
2010-12-18T20:55:17  <antimatroid> i would really like to get the point of being able to feed game strings to the ste in the next day or so though, then i'm going to be busy till early january
2010-12-18T20:57:22  <antimatroid> Frontier: do the commands need to be in any spceific order?
2010-12-18T20:57:29  <antimatroid> or can i just spam you with information to update
2010-12-18T20:58:54  <Frontier> Spam me, there should be no reason for a particular order.
2010-12-18T20:59:08  <antimatroid> also, when ants all collide and all die, those grains get deposited onto that square, how am i to pass you that grain update?
2010-12-18T20:59:43  <antimatroid> actually, nevermind
2010-12-18T21:00:07  <Frontier> "G" ;)
2010-12-18T21:00:26  <Frontier> or shall we make that a "Q" for sQuare update?
2010-12-18T21:00:38  <antimatroid> okay, i'm changing S row column grains at the bottom of the spec you sent me to G row column grains
2010-12-18T21:00:43  <antimatroid> so S is used for spawning
2010-12-18T21:01:11  <Frontier> i updated that here: http://pastebin.com/j1qFsEdE
2010-12-18T21:02:14  <antimatroid> hmmm, a spawned ant can go on to be part of a collision
2010-12-18T21:02:58  <Frontier> uh, what do you mean? is there a problem with that?
2010-12-18T21:03:12  <antimatroid> it's easier if i don't differentiate kind of spawned ant to give only those alive for at least 1 move a unique id
2010-12-18T21:03:42  <antimatroid> wait, no i think i can do it, don't worry :)
2010-12-18T21:04:16  <antimatroid> ...or even better, would you prefer me to spawn the ant and then have it die as well?
2010-12-18T21:04:31  <antimatroid> that makes it easier for me and possibly better for visualising
2010-12-18T21:04:44  <Frontier> yes pleae, that is how I had it in mind :)
2010-12-18T21:05:09  <antimatroid> okay, i'll get back to work now
2010-12-18T21:05:14  <Frontier> but then... keep the S and K in order :)
2010-12-18T21:06:00  <antimatroid> yeah, it can't die before i spawn it :)
2010-12-18T21:07:09  <antimatroid> oh, add id between F/S and row on your specifications :)
2010-12-18T21:09:26  <Frontier> http://pastebin.com/i6Xw9ZGG
2010-12-18T21:10:26  <Frontier> you know, databases often come with an auto-id feature :p
2010-12-18T21:12:03  <antimatroid> i've never used a database before :P
2010-12-18T21:13:26  <Frontier> INSERT INTO ants VALUES (row, column, player, hp, harvest); DELETE FROM ants WHERE id = mysql_insert_id();

2010-12-18T21:15:08  <antimatroid> if id numbers start getting out of hand, i can just create a queue of unused ids at some point
2010-12-18T21:15:14  <antimatroid> well, stack may even be better
2010-12-18T21:15:36  <antimatroid> but for the moment i'd like to try every single spawn being a new id
2010-12-18T21:17:18  <Frontier> We get at most 2*turns ant ids. So 3 digits could be the limit anyway.
2010-12-18T21:19:25  <antimatroid> ah, yes, easy
2010-12-18T21:19:37  <antimatroid> i'm thinking of starting with 3-400 turns a game for this
2010-12-18T21:19:43  <antimatroid> i expect it might be needed
2010-12-18T21:20:04  <antimatroid> i wonder if ants should be able to harvest all grains on a square in one turn? might speed the game up a bit
2010-12-18T21:20:14  <antimatroid> i am allowing them to deposit any amount each turn for that purpose
2010-12-18T21:20:24  <antimatroid> any feasible amount, anyway
2010-12-18T21:21:06  <Frontier> hm, why not. we can try both versions.
2010-12-18T21:23:09  <antimatroid> hmm, i'm not sure i like that
2010-12-18T21:23:26  <antimatroid> then you can't get stuck trying to harvest near an enemy ant, cause you basically go in, swoop it up and run away
2010-12-18T21:25:18  <Frontier> Will you use the U command? I remember you preferred to add the information to the other commands or make them implicit. (I.e. an attacked ant loses 1 hp, deposit gets a deposit count, rtc...)
2010-12-18T21:25:48  <Frontier> And can ants pick up grains from the base - although that's stupid?
2010-12-18T21:26:31  <Frontier> Cause if not I would display the base grains on a side panel, like the production/ship count in PlanetWars
2010-12-18T21:28:26  <antimatroid> Frontier: i was letting them pick up from home, but it's a stupid move, so i'll make it an ignored invalid move
2010-12-18T21:28:35  <antimatroid> because that would look better
2010-12-18T21:28:41  <antimatroid> i think i will be able to use U for you
2010-12-18T21:28:58  <antimatroid> but wait an hour or so and i should have the updates done for an example game string
