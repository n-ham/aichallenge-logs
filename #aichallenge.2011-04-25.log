2011-04-25T00:49:18  <janzert> sigh: is there a reason not to just leave stderr alone in the default case so it simply continues to print to the console?
2011-04-25T00:49:49  <janzert> although I suppose that would mix multiple bots output together if more than one are printing to it
2011-04-25T00:50:05  <sigh> yeah, I wasn't sure
2011-04-25T00:50:24  <sigh> currently there are two cases, log to file and ignore altogether
2011-04-25T00:51:11  <sigh> before it was just printing stderr when the bot died, but that resulted in blocking
2011-04-25T00:51:13  <janzert> yeah, I see your new code. certainly better than just eating it (without really eating it) like it was before
2011-04-25T00:51:36  <sigh> maybe three options? file, stdout and ignore?
2011-04-25T00:51:39  <janzert> ahh, I didn't realize it even printed it at the end
2011-04-25T00:52:03  <janzert> I'd go for file, stderr and ignore
2011-04-25T00:52:14  <sigh> and make stdout the default so it sort of acts like before?
2011-04-25T00:52:26  <janzert> makes it easy to use a redirect if they want to that way
2011-04-25T00:52:45  <sigh> what do you mean?
2011-04-25T00:53:06  <janzert> keep the bots stderr the engines stderr
2011-04-25T00:53:20  <janzert> don't redirect it to the engines stdout
2011-04-25T00:53:25  <sigh> ah yes... of course
2011-04-25T00:53:47  <janzert> and yeah, I think that is probably the least surprising default
2011-04-25T00:54:06  <sigh> yeah, that'll be easy... I'll do that

2011-04-25T06:21:07  <Stocha> with a bot that tend to cluster ants, and another one that tend to spread them.
2011-04-25T06:21:36  <Stocha> 5 definetly favors the clustering one. 4 is far less obvious. (although it still favor clustering)
2011-04-25T06:21:58  <Stocha> They do not make special actions for optimizing the combat.

2011-04-25T06:32:14  <sigh> antimatroid? what was that about?
2011-04-25T06:32:31  <antimatroid> that's the translate amount for visible squares of an ant
2011-04-25T06:32:41  <antimatroid> so one doesn't actually need to search for them from each ant
2011-04-25T06:32:58  <sigh> why would you search for them?

2011-04-25T06:51:45  <Stocha> arguably it is worth trying reducing the sight radius. Although i find that it is low enough as it stand. you don't have much time to plan already.
2011-04-25T06:53:05  <Stocha> Once the beta start, i hope every change will be justified and submitted to the community for review.

2011-04-25T09:51:08  <Stocha> if you can't limit the memory a bot take, you can always decide beforehand how much is the maximum. Then launch the bots, and then kill a bot that take too much. (auto forfeit) then relaunch the game with this bot forfeit.
2011-04-25T09:51:30  <Stocha> it's not ideal though. Then you have the virtual machine and other stuff to take into account ideally.

2011-04-25T13:50:21  <Frontier> sure
2011-04-25T13:50:38  <amstan> so, what do i do to use your ant task?
2011-04-25T13:53:56  <Frontier> just run "ant deploy" with the variable 'deploy.path' set to where you want the website to be. A subdirectory 'visualizer' will be created in there.
2011-04-25T13:57:33  <Frontier> "ant -Ddeploy.path=/my/www/target/directory" should work
2011-04-25T13:58:42  <mcstar> hello guys
2011-04-25T13:58:51  <mcstar> i have a quick question
2011-04-25T13:59:04  <Frontier> answer is: when it's done
2011-04-25T13:59:21  <mcstar> how long does it take for an experienced programmer to preapare for the challenge?
2011-04-25T14:00:24  <Naktibalda> how long does it take for you to prepare for a new project?
2011-04-25T14:00:27  <Frontier> mcstar: what do you mean by prepare. You get a starter package with a working bot, so there is literally no delay to getting into the game
2011-04-25T14:00:55  <mcstar> true
2011-04-25T14:01:04  <mcstar> but u cant compete with that bot really
2011-04-25T14:01:19  <Frontier> You'll have to read one or two wiki pages to understand the rules, then it is all about your available time and creativity
2011-04-25T14:01:36  <mcstar> let me rephrase it
2011-04-25T14:01:44  <mcstar> how much time will u invest?
2011-04-25T14:01:53  <mcstar> approximately
2011-04-25T14:02:17  <mcstar> before i start doing anything i must have a timeframe
2011-04-25T14:04:50  <Frontier> let's say the contest will last two months and I have no idea how long I will be motivated. if you need a timeframe, you should set it for yourself.

2011-04-25T14:05:59  <Naktibalda> amstan: committed
2011-04-25T14:06:26  <mcstar> i suppose once my bot is uploaded, theres no room for any modifications
2011-04-25T14:06:40  <Naktibalda> you can upload new versions as many times as you want

2011-04-25T14:07:16  <Frontier> mcstar: When the contest starts you have ~2 months to code your bot and when you upload something you will get results almost instantly because the bots compete against each other from hour 0.
2011-04-25T14:07:45  <mcstar> ty
2011-04-25T14:07:49  <amstan> Naktibalda: did you test it?
2011-04-25T14:08:03  <Naktibalda> yes, I did
2011-04-25T14:08:17  <Frontier> after the 2 months no more modifications are allowed and the contest server will run a final round of games to produce the final results

2011-04-25T14:57:06  <Frontier1> amstan: Does it work if JAVA_HOME is defined? Since I don't know what to do about it access to the test server wont help me much there.

2011-04-25T14:57:26  <amstan> idk, what do i define it as?
2011-04-25T14:59:23  <Frontier1> Set it to your Java installation directory which contains a bin and lib directory
2011-04-25T15:00:31  <amstan> Frontier1: i have /usr, where there's a bin and a lib, both with javas in it
2011-04-25T15:01:37  <Frontier1> ${java.home}/lib/plugin.jar must exist
2011-04-25T15:01:58  <Frontier1> probably do a search for plugin.jar :)
2011-04-25T15:02:36  <amstan>  /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/plugin.jar
2011-04-25T15:03:35  <amstan> http://pastebin.com/jEEhhxsn
2011-04-25T15:04:39  <Frontier1> I realize that Ubuntu Java packages are all supposed to work withouth JAVA_HOME defined, but I could not find a solution for the plugin.jar problem. And ant has a predefined java.home directory dereived from the system's JAVA_HOME. Maybe in 10 years the OS developers will have agreed on a new standard. I like the env variable though, since it works with Windows as well.
2011-04-25T15:05:24  <Frontier1> don't you have to do 'export JAVA_HOME= ...' if you run it like this?
2011-04-25T15:06:19  <amstan> adding export doesn't fix it
2011-04-25T15:08:42  <Frontier1> try omitting the tailing slash from the path. other than that I don't really know what the problem could be.
2011-04-25T15:09:30  <amstan> what about sun.plugin.javascript
2011-04-25T15:09:38  <amstan> am i supposed to have that installed separately or something?
2011-04-25T15:10:18  <Frontier1> It is a Java package (namespace) which resides in plugin.jar
2011-04-25T15:10:25  <amstan> ok
2011-04-25T15:10:46  <amstan> Frontier1: try #java or something
2011-04-25T15:10:50  <Frontier1> If you open plugin.jar you'll see the folder structure 'sun/plungin/javascript/...
2011-04-25T15:10:56  <amstan> maybe they'll guide you
2011-04-25T15:11:04  <amstan> or #ant
2011-04-25T15:11:20  <amstan> nope.. not #ant, lol
2011-04-25T15:12:06  <Frontier1> maybe #unix, how do i set env variables ^^
2011-04-25T15:12:30  <amstan> i don't think this should be an env variables thing
2011-04-25T15:12:36  <amstan> most of the time you don't have to touch them
2011-04-25T15:13:02  <Frontier1> but most of the time you have to set them up once
2011-04-25T15:13:34  <Frontier1> (or they are set up by installed packages)

2011-04-25T15:40:22  <amstan> that's fine
2011-04-25T15:41:06  <Frontier1> It is because of Java and the required fonts and other libs.

2011-04-25T16:07:57  <Frontier1> The default-jdk on the server doesn't come with a plugin.jar, unfortunatly.
2011-04-25T16:08:38  <Frontier1> I could try icedtea, but you are using the Sun JDK, correct?
2011-04-25T16:09:11  <Frontier1> ah you use openjdk
2011-04-25T16:09:16  <amstan> apparently i used openjdk
2011-04-25T16:09:25  <amstan> and there's no sun java in the repo it seems
2011-04-25T16:10:08  <Frontier1> so why do YOU have a plugin.jar and the server doesn't? Is it because the server is configured as 'headless'?
2011-04-25T16:10:27  <amstan> icedtea6-plugin seems to be the package providing plugin.jar

2011-04-25T16:24:21  <Frontier1> it may behave differently from openjdk and the oracle jdk.

2011-04-25T16:28:00  <amstan> dude..
2011-04-25T16:30:30  <Frontier1> *sigh* it provides a plugin.jar, but not in a lib directory. I just assumed an Oracle JDK to be installed. Looks like that was a bad idea.
2011-04-25T16:33:29  <Frontier1> amstan: There is no way I could possibly find plugin.jar with the plentora of operating systems and Java runtimes. I should make the full path to plugin.jar a property for the build process defaulting to <java.home>/lib/plugin.jar.

2011-04-25T18:38:24  <janzert> np, it really is quite difficult though
2011-04-25T18:39:00  <janzert> the current method doesn't incur any overhead generally
2011-04-25T18:39:24  <janzert> i.e. the sandboxing info on the wiki is quite old
2011-04-25T18:39:36  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-25T18:40:13  <mcstar> are u participating or just making the challenge possible?
2011-04-25T18:40:34  <janzert> just helping set it up
2011-04-25T18:40:54  <janzert> not participating for sure, I'm disqualified by virtue of having access to the servers
2011-04-25T18:41:02  <mcstar> ok right
2011-04-25T18:41:07  <mcstar> havent thought of that :)
2011-04-25T18:46:11  <mcstar> btw ur halting problem only applies to asm w/o virtual memory manager i think
2011-04-25T18:46:53  <janzert> if the language somehow allows self modification of code I think you end up at the halting problem
2011-04-25T18:47:17  <mcstar> well i think the OS is already is a sandbox
2011-04-25T18:47:26  <janzert> so any language that includes an exec

2011-04-25T18:47:59  <mcstar> u cant access the parts of memory responsible for IO
2011-04-25T18:48:05  <mcstar> only if the OS allows you
2011-04-25T18:48:23  <mcstar> it has nothing to do with turing completeness i think
2011-04-25T18:48:42  <janzert> I thought we were talking about scanning source code for malicious actions?
2011-04-25T18:48:48  <mcstar> yes

2011-04-25T18:49:23  <mcstar> but a process is managed by the operating system as i understand it
2011-04-25T18:49:45  <janzert> I'm saying if the language allows self modified code to run then you can't tell if the program will perform a malicious action without solving the halting problem
2011-04-25T18:50:05  <mcstar> im saying that you can :)
2011-04-25T18:50:28  <mcstar> u cant make heads or tails of what its trying to do
2011-04-25T18:50:40  <mcstar> but to make harm it must ask the OS for certain IO
2011-04-25T18:50:42  <janzert> you can go outside of the program and prevent it (that is what a sandbox does) but you can't just scan it before hand and say yes it is safe
2011-04-25T18:51:09  <janzert> but you can't know what the program will do be simply scanning it
2011-04-25T18:51:27  <janzert> that is the gist of the halting problem
2011-04-25T18:52:16  <mcstar> but i know if it accesses the outside world, and i can inspect that system call even in the source code
2011-04-25T18:52:40  <mcstar> it must use glibc for example
2011-04-25T18:52:44  <janzert> the system call may not be apparent in the original source code
2011-04-25T18:53:01  <janzert> it can build it by using the self modifying code
2011-04-25T18:53:16  <janzert> anyway I've gotta run
2011-04-25T18:53:20  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-25T18:53:26  <janzert> see you around
2011-04-25T18:53:33  <mcstar> i think i see what u mean
2011-04-25T18:53:34  <mcstar> bb
2011-04-25T18:55:07  <janzert> you might be interested in looking up a competition that ran (I believe) last year where the goal was to make a program that would black out portions of an image but still surreptitiously leave the original information embedded in the image
2011-04-25T18:55:20  <janzert> and make it so the source of the program looked completely innocent
2011-04-25T18:55:44  <mcstar> whats it called?
2011-04-25T18:55:49  <janzert> unfortunately I don't remember the name or much else about the competition
2011-04-25T18:56:03  <mcstar> once i saw a C source
2011-04-25T18:56:17  <mcstar> which printed a thanksgiving song
2011-04-25T18:56:18  <janzert> I mostly remember a write up on the winners
2011-04-25T18:56:28  <mcstar> but u couldnt find it in the source
2011-04-25T18:56:45  <mcstar> ill try to find it ty
2011-04-25T18:57:32  <janzert> yeah, there are lots of obfuscated source competitions the really interesting part of this one was that source code was meant to look completely innocent and correct
2011-04-25T18:57:44  * janzert really goes away
2011-04-25T19:09:56  <Zannick> i've seen an ioccc entry that used lots of #defines before what appeared to be a java hello world program

2011-04-25T20:01:47  <janzert> yes, although 2 month length could be subject to change

2011-04-25T21:12:39  <amstan> it was made on 10.10
2011-04-25T21:12:44  <computerwiz_222> decent
2011-04-25T21:12:48  <janzert> it only works on 10.10 so far as I've tested :P
2011-04-25T21:13:21  <amstan> server_setup.py works nicely on 11.04

2011-04-25T21:13:46  <janzert> yeah, I would hope that there wouldn't be much change needed for 11.04
2011-04-25T21:14:29  <janzert> the worker setup is in flux right now as I get chroots integrated

2011-04-25T21:15:42  <amstan> computerwiz_222: it's not like our pw server was any better
2011-04-25T21:18:17  <janzert> also after doing a bit of browsing on current server pricing I'm a little less leery about using Ec2 for all our server (including the main server)
2011-04-25T21:19:09  <janzert> the main thing that still concerns me is instance stability on Ec2 for the main server, especially if we're going to jump right on 11.04
2011-04-25T21:20:20  <j3camero> The main web server does need to be pretty solid. I have no problem having it not on EC2.
2011-04-25T21:20:30  <j3camero> Especially given the Ec2 fail as of late.
2011-04-25T21:20:30  <amstan> i'm ok with that, i was all for using dedicated servers before
2011-04-25T21:20:55  <j3camero> Hell, we could even host it with the CSC. Not sure that's actually more stable though...
2011-04-25T21:21:28  <jbroman> j3camero: Well, the EC2 failure was EBS.
2011-04-25T21:21:41  <jbroman> Local storage was minimally affected.
2011-04-25T21:21:51  <jbroman> CSC has more frequent outages, really.
2011-04-25T21:22:00  <jbroman> (I say that as the previous sysadmin.)
2011-04-25T21:22:14  <janzert> jbroman: yeah, the recent outage shouldn't have been much of a problem for us
2011-04-25T21:22:17  <j3camero> I was really impressed by the two days of "scheduled power outage" in the MC building a few months back.

2011-04-25T21:23:16  <janzert> the version of ubuntu we used in the last contest would randomly hard lock up about every ~6 hours, that's the part that worries me

2011-04-25T21:24:10  <j3camero> I assume that we will be able to switch OS versions pretty easily. Is it just a matter of updating all the package names and so on?
2011-04-25T21:24:26  <McLeopold> But that was just workers?
2011-04-25T21:24:27  <janzert> depends on what has changed in the OS :/
2011-04-25T21:24:52  <janzert> McLeopold: for planetwars yes and isn't really a problem for workers to do so
2011-04-25T21:25:05  <janzert> it would be a problem if the main server was though
2011-04-25T21:26:23  <janzert> as an example of changes between OS versions that would effect us, the location of chroot config files seems to have changed with every version of ubuntu for the three previous versions leading up to and including 10.10
2011-04-25T21:26:39  <amstan> so far me and Frontier had a huge problem with just the difference between 10.10 and 11.04
2011-04-25T21:26:43  <janzert> I haven't seen any reference that it changes in 11.04 though
2011-04-25T21:26:48  <amstan> it's a totally different package that we need and stuff like that
2011-04-25T21:27:30  <amstan> i just think we should do stuff on 11.04
2011-04-25T21:27:54  <amstan> the beta was out for a while, and we'll regret if we don't have the latest packages for something because we're not having the most recent ubuntu
2011-04-25T21:28:13  <janzert> I just like the extra 6 months of stabilizing :}
2011-04-25T21:28:56  <jaycobcoleman> I've had no problems at all with Meerkat maverick :P If that's at all comforting
2011-04-25T21:29:23  <janzert> if 11.04 proves itself stable as released though I don't really have a problem with jumping to it
2011-04-25T21:29:24  <jaycobcoleman> or those two words switched
2011-04-25T21:29:46  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-25T21:30:23  <jaycobcoleman> What reason is there to go to 11.04?
2011-04-25T21:30:37  <janzert> the benefit is newer language versions
2011-04-25T21:30:47  <janzert> at least I believe that is the main benefit
2011-04-25T21:31:09  <janzert> and of course that doesn't matter so much for older stable languages
2011-04-25T21:31:12  <j3camero> Why not pick an older LTS version that has had some time to work out all the kinks?
2011-04-25T21:31:39  <janzert> that caused more problems because of old language versions in the last contest
2011-04-25T21:32:07  <computerwiz_222> LTS is overrated if you ask me
2011-04-25T21:32:13  <janzert> everyone wanted their new language version because the one included was "ancient"
2011-04-25T21:32:22  <j3camero> lol

2011-04-25T21:33:46  <janzert> we didn't have 2.6 :P
2011-04-25T21:33:57  <j3camero> amstan: no no I ust bought the game. But I have self control don't worry.
2011-04-25T21:33:59  <jaycobcoleman> :)
2011-04-25T21:34:03  <amstan> 11.04 comes with 2.7, everyone will be overjoyed
2011-04-25T21:34:12  <janzert> :)
2011-04-25T21:34:13  <amstan> j3camero: you can come to my server later
2011-04-25T21:34:27  <computerwiz_222>  j3camero: you think you have self control... but then you play minecraft
2011-04-25T21:34:37  <jaycobcoleman> this ^
2011-04-25T21:35:05  <computerwiz_222> for some reason minecraft always seems more interesting during exams
2011-04-25T21:35:19  <jaycobcoleman> or really anytime you should be doing something
2011-04-25T21:35:22  <jaycobcoleman> like sleeping
2011-04-25T21:36:19  <computerwiz_222> so.. i'm sitting idle hanging out amstan's place, are there any housekeeping jobs that anyone needs done?
2011-04-25T21:37:00  <jaycobcoleman> So has anyone played through portal 2?
2011-04-25T21:37:06  <jbroman> jaycobcoleman: I have.
2011-04-25T21:37:16  <jaycobcoleman> Have you played co-op?
2011-04-25T21:37:49  <jbroman> Yes.
2011-04-25T21:38:26  <jaycobcoleman> Blast. I want to play it, but not with a completely random person. Not that I know you
2011-04-25T21:39:06  <jbroman> Ah, well. It's good; you'll enjoy it.
2011-04-25T21:39:15  <jaycobcoleman> MOOON!!!

2011-04-25T21:40:26  <janzert> yeah, just wish the co-op play had been a little longer
2011-04-25T21:41:11  <jbroman> On the other hand there was less of a story to co-op and trying to find five hours (how long it took me) to play with a friend is tricky enough.
2011-04-25T21:41:12  <janzert> played it with my brother and there were times where I've never laughed that hard in a game before :)
2011-04-25T21:41:23  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * r4c87c77 / (.gitignore INSTALL.md): added more info to the INSTALL instructions, added stuff to gitignore - http://bit.ly/i5LVWr
2011-04-25T21:41:26  <jbroman> The single-player was hilarious.
2011-04-25T21:42:19  <janzert> I was actually discussing it today, but I don't think there can be as strong of a story line in a co-op mode as you can get in single player
2011-04-25T21:42:28  <amstan> contestbot: forget newdesign
2011-04-25T21:42:28  <contestbot> amstan: Job's done.
2011-04-25T21:42:28  <computerwiz_222> So what does everyone think of the new design?
2011-04-25T21:42:29  <computerwiz_222> http://hypertriangle.com:13080/
2011-04-25T21:42:36  <janzert> I really liked the opening sequence in the single player
2011-04-25T21:42:47  <jbroman> janzert: I had the same discussion with a person that said "not adding co-op is because they hate people with friends" (or similar)
2011-04-25T21:43:23  <jaycobcoleman> I would really like ideas from people. I'm planning on writing up some  strategy guides, but would like some input as to what theories should be covered. I plan on splitting them into large groups like pathfinding, decision making, etc. and then sub-groups of difficulty; beginner, intermediate, advanced.
2011-04-25T21:43:47  <janzert> the thing I realized playing the co-op was that I just couldn't concentrate on the story as much because I was involved with the person I was playing with
2011-04-25T21:43:55  <jaycobcoleman> and the site is looking beautiful
2011-04-25T21:43:56  <amstan> Frontier: you still here? i might need some guidance
2011-04-25T21:45:11  <janzert> the new design is really coming together nice
2011-04-25T21:45:29  <computerwiz_222> good to hear
2011-04-25T21:46:00  <janzert> I can't wait to see how the visualizer embedded on the front page looks
2011-04-25T21:48:08  <computerwiz_222> janzert: working on it with amstan
2011-04-25T21:48:42  * janzert nods
2011-04-25T21:49:40  <amstan> problem is that frontier is not here

2011-04-25T21:52:16  <computerwiz_222> there is always next year.. i was helping amstan compile his entry - too bad he didn't get in
2011-04-25T21:52:27  <antimatroid> it means i get to do something more interesting to me for my honours thesis and with something i can bare programming for
2011-04-25T21:52:29  <antimatroid> but no $5k
2011-04-25T21:52:39  <amstan> so i got this so far.. http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/website/visualizer.php?game_id=0
2011-04-25T21:52:39  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: was the new vision code put into starter bots, sample bots, or both?
2011-04-25T21:52:54  <amstan> http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/website/visualizer.php?game_id=1

2011-04-25T21:53:05  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: it was just put into the python and c++ starter bots i think
2011-04-25T21:53:14  <antimatroid> but all old bots should work fine the way they did
2011-04-25T21:53:15  <computerwiz_222> amstan: that is decent :D
2011-04-25T21:54:03  <antimatroid> amstan: that looks good, although when i full screen it the right menus are slightly hanging off the screen
2011-04-25T21:54:24  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: I know that mcleopold put it into the starter packs... I don't think the sample bots use vision
2011-04-25T21:54:27  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: yes, good point
2011-04-25T21:54:39  <sigh> I would have to check though, but I'm sure you can do that :)
2011-04-25T21:54:43  <amstan> antimatroid: yeah, i guess, that's because i have some css to always display the scrollbar
2011-04-25T21:54:47  <amstan> i should fix this with frontier
2011-04-25T21:55:01  <jaycobcoleman> sigh: You're definitely right
2011-04-25T21:55:03  <antimatroid> yep, just noting it
2011-04-25T21:55:07  <jaycobcoleman> I forgot about that
2011-04-25T21:55:08  <antimatroid> i much prefer the full screen to the other

2011-04-25T21:56:08  <antimatroid> i'll update the map generator and maps for that at some point
2011-04-25T21:56:12  <amstan> the coding behind it is flexible too, the games are stored inside games

2011-04-25T22:03:27  <amstan> it kinda keeps us unfocused
2011-04-25T22:03:44  <McLeopold> jaycobcoleman: first, you must understand that reverting updates will affect the entire repo, not just specific directories
2011-04-25T22:04:00  <jaycobcoleman> that's fine, I've been keeping my things elsewhere
2011-04-25T22:04:19  <McLeopold> jaycobcoleman: if you haven't changed much, use "git checkout <file>"
2011-04-25T22:04:26  <McLeopold> you can do files 1 at a time
2011-04-25T22:04:28  <antimatroid> i think stocha has a fair argument, he didn't care for removing the implicit information that we did for food, but he's asking for that information, i think we should just provide it
2011-04-25T22:04:37  <antimatroid> starter bots could easily mark seen/unseen information then
2011-04-25T22:04:43  <jaycobcoleman> can't do something like checkout *?
2011-04-25T22:04:52  <antimatroid> it wont break any pre-existing bots
2011-04-25T22:05:13  <McLeopold> jayacobcoleman: probably you can
2011-04-25T22:05:27  <antimatroid> amstan: i too would also like to get these changes done sooner rather than later though :P
2011-04-25T22:06:09  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * r209b6e6 / (.gitignore website/visualizer.php): resized visualizer to fit the new design - http://bit.ly/go0PyF
2011-04-25T22:06:16  <McLeopold> antimatroid: we've looked at that before and it was 10x more text to parse
2011-04-25T22:06:32  <antimatroid> wasn't that for displaying currently visible land?
2011-04-25T22:06:45  <McLeopold> maybe it was...
2011-04-25T22:06:51  <antimatroid> otherwise i can just tell stocha no dice
2011-04-25T22:07:32  <antimatroid> i could easily give the information he's asking for in my bot
2011-04-25T22:07:38  <antimatroid> just mark a square as seen in ones vision code
2011-04-25T22:07:48  <McLeopold> we could make vision code a requirement of starter bots and not send foor nor land
2011-04-25T22:07:58  <antimatroid> i think that might be easiest
2011-04-25T22:08:42  <McLeopold> when I was benchmarking my java bot, string parsing was taking most of the processing time
2011-04-25T22:09:11  <antimatroid> contestbot: later tell Stocha no dice on first seen land information (we're concerned about the size of input to bots, particularly when being sent for tcp games), but we are willing to make it a requirement in the starter bots that the information is calculated without any competitor programming necessary
2011-04-25T22:09:11  <contestbot> antimatroid: As you wish.
2011-04-25T22:09:41  <McLeopold> I forgot about tcp, so yeah, let's not do it
2011-04-25T22:10:03  <McLeopold> So...would you be okay with removing 'r' lines as well?  Can't we calc that?
2011-04-25T22:10:04  <antimatroid> i do think we should kindly ask people to update the starter bots with the information
2011-04-25T22:10:17  <antimatroid> if some of the less used starter packages don't get updated, i don't really care
2011-04-25T22:10:30  <antimatroid> you can calculate that but it's significantly more work
2011-04-25T22:10:33  <jaycobcoleman> McLeopold. Says I'm ahead 1 commit, then listed a few files. I did git checkout * and when I tried again it still said ahead 1 commit but didn't list any files. The vision code seems to be the same as before though and I know that was updated
2011-04-25T22:10:34  <antimatroid> i really really want to keep those
2011-04-25T22:11:08  <antimatroid> working out the r lines yourself consists of tracking what is new and old food information after passing state information and deleting any visible old food information
2011-04-25T22:11:13  <jaycobcoleman> I like the 'r' lines as weel
2011-04-25T22:11:13  <jaycobcoleman> *well
2011-04-25T22:11:14  <McLeopold> jaycobcoleman: you can go "git reset" I think.  amstan may be able to give a better command
2011-04-25T22:11:17  <antimatroid> working out seen squares is a hell of a lot easier
2011-04-25T22:12:12  <sigh> jaycobcoleman: if you ahead by 1 commit then you have a local commit
2011-04-25T22:12:32  <McLeopold> antimatroid: loop through previous food locations and then check visibility, if not food and visible, then remove
2011-04-25T22:12:49  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: the others will laugh at me for this, but sometimes if i really mess things up locally, i just grab my changes, delete everything, grab it again and start over :P
2011-04-25T22:13:11  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ha ha (voice of nelson)
2011-04-25T22:13:17  <jaycobcoleman> haha I think I'll take your method animatroid
2011-04-25T22:13:18  <sigh> :)
2011-04-25T22:13:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think you mean if food and visible
2011-04-25T22:13:30  <antimatroid> but what if it's a food location now?
2011-04-25T22:13:34  <sigh> I've done that a few times as I've been getting to know git :)
2011-04-25T22:13:37  <antimatroid> you need to track the new and old food information
2011-04-25T22:13:42  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if not reported as food this turn and visible
2011-04-25T22:13:49  <antimatroid> that's quite a bit of effort as opposed to just marking a square as not food if you receive an 'r' line
2011-04-25T22:14:53  <McLeopold> but would be consistent with not sending 'l' lines

2011-04-25T22:16:17  <McLeopold> antimatroid: are you distinguishing between food that is visible and not visible?
2011-04-25T22:16:32  <antimatroid> i'm giving information about visible squares having food or not
2011-04-25T22:16:55  <McLeopold> and non-visible squares that don't have food?
2011-04-25T22:17:04  <McLeopold> i mean *do* have food
2011-04-25T22:17:11  <jmcarthur> lol yeah i'm kind of glad i'm not bothering with this starter anymore!
2011-04-25T22:17:13  <antimatroid> no r lines or f lines are given for a square that isn't visible
2011-04-25T22:17:29  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: the change is really trivial
2011-04-25T22:17:37  <antimatroid> like not clearing food information and handling an r line
2011-04-25T22:17:46  <McLeopold> right, but you're given an 'f' line, then that space goes out of vision, do you flag it differently?
2011-04-25T22:18:02  <antimatroid> i stop assuming it's no longer there
2011-04-25T22:18:14  <computerwiz_222> janzert: i was just sifting through some old forum posts and I saw that you had keepalives enabled on the server. I'm a bit of a server noob.. why would you need keepalives? I am curious as to their application.
2011-04-25T22:18:16  <antimatroid> if food is there when it goes out of vision, you now have the option of assuming whether it stays or goes
2011-04-25T22:18:44  <jmcarthur> why not just store the last time food was seen there?
2011-04-25T22:18:47  <antimatroid> and you don't have to implicitly work out the state of a visible square once it comes back into range
2011-04-25T22:18:59  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@99.162.151.97> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-25T22:19:15  <McLeopold> yeah, but what do you do in the data structure when it goes out of vision?
2011-04-25T22:19:17  <jmcarthur> if you always report the last time food was seen in a particular place you don't even have to distinguish between visible and invisible
2011-04-25T22:19:28  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: you can, but the different is processing an r line vs distinguishing between new and old food information after processing input and calculating visible squares so that you can delete visible squares with just old food information
2011-04-25T22:19:52  <antimatroid> depending on what assumption you want to make about food out of range
2011-04-25T22:19:58  <jmcarthur> huh?
2011-04-25T22:20:08  <antimatroid> if you want to assume food that goes out of range is still food
2011-04-25T22:20:19  <jmcarthur> what i just proposed means you don't have to assume anything
2011-04-25T22:20:29  <antimatroid> in order to determine whether the location doesn't have food when you get back in view of the square, you need to do the above
2011-04-25T22:20:47  <jmcarthur> oh you mean because of the crazy input format?
2011-04-25T22:20:50  <McLeopold> you still need to know when a space in general was last seen so you can compare to the food list last seen
2011-04-25T22:20:51  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-25T22:20:54  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-04-25T22:21:03  <jmcarthur> well you know i won't defend that :P
2011-04-25T22:21:11  <antimatroid> my problem is with how hard it is to calculate that implicit information which should be trivial
2011-04-25T22:21:21  <antimatroid> the 'r' line fixed it perfectly
2011-04-25T22:22:00  <antimatroid> you get an 'r' line if a visible square without food contained food the last time you saw it
2011-04-25T22:22:04  <antimatroid> including if that was last turn
2011-04-25T22:22:19  <jaycobcoleman> I think animatroid's solution would take out a little bit of unnecessary computing time on something trivial, apart from that I don't care anymore
2011-04-25T22:22:22  <antimatroid> so people don't need to wipe food information if they want to track non-visible food, and can just process those 'r' lines
2011-04-25T22:22:29  <jaycobcoleman> I don't really see a reason not to implement it
2011-04-25T22:22:46  <antimatroid> i'm more worried about having messy bots with code prone to bugs
2011-04-25T22:22:58  <antimatroid> i'm more interested in people competing on strategies, not how well they can handle information
2011-04-25T22:23:24  <McLeopold> but you're okay with making them calc unseen land?
2011-04-25T22:23:45  <antimatroid> ,... aren't we suggesting people do it for people in the starter bots?
2011-04-25T22:23:47  <jmcarthur> i actually don't see how an 'r' line is all that helpful. it only makes sense if you're making assumptions in the first place, doesn't it?
2011-04-25T22:23:48  <antimatroid> as it's so trivial
2011-04-25T22:24:01  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: the other option is also an assumption
2011-04-25T22:24:18  <antimatroid> this way people can easily make whichever assumption they like
2011-04-25T22:24:21  <jmcarthur> it also doesn't help you with squares you can't see anyway
2011-04-25T22:24:29  <McLeopold> I think to be consistant, we either include both 'r' and 'l' lines, or neither.
2011-04-25T22:24:35  <jmcarthur> so you will keep making the same assumption about them
2011-04-25T22:24:36  <antimatroid> no, but it gives you explicit information about visible squares
2011-04-25T22:24:54  <jaycobcoleman> what do 'i' lines indicate?
2011-04-25T22:24:57  <McLeopold> If we include neither, the spec is simpler
2011-04-25T22:25:01  <McLeopold> 'L' lines
2011-04-25T22:25:10  <antimatroid> l lines indicate a non-water square the first time it's seen
2011-04-25T22:25:20  <antimatroid> and my vote is for including both if it's both or none
2011-04-25T22:25:21  <McLeopold> jaycobcoleman: you need a better font for your IRC :P
2011-04-25T22:25:23  <jaycobcoleman> 'l' sorry
2011-04-25T22:25:38  <jaycobcoleman> by the way lets not use L
2011-04-25T22:25:41  <jaycobcoleman> for that very reason
2011-04-25T22:25:48  <antimatroid> but it's land
2011-04-25T22:25:55  <antimatroid> g for ground?
2011-04-25T22:26:11  <McLeopold> that's ridiculous, it's not OCR'd or anthing
2011-04-25T22:26:48  <antimatroid> McLeopold: if all starter bots have to do vision, they can pseudo explicitly provide the l line information for people
2011-04-25T22:26:56  <antimatroid> it's a matter of marking a square as seen if it's visible
2011-04-25T22:27:01  <McLeopold> antimatroid: ant the 'r' info as well
2011-04-25T22:27:07  <antimatroid> not so simple
2011-04-25T22:27:10  <antimatroid> as i've explained
2011-04-25T22:27:16  <McLeopold> It seems just as simple or hard in my mind
2011-04-25T22:27:32  <McLeopold> what's the difference in calculating the 2?
2011-04-25T22:27:33  <antimatroid> it's much messier imo and requires quite a bit of changing stuff
2011-04-25T22:27:39  <bhasker> evening folks
2011-04-25T22:27:45  <antimatroid> bhasker: evening?
2011-04-25T22:27:48  <antimatroid> calculating the 2?
2011-04-25T22:27:52  <McLeopold> bhasker: boy or girl?
2011-04-25T22:27:54  <antimatroid> erm, ignore that ?
2011-04-25T22:27:55  <bhasker> yup evening :)
2011-04-25T22:27:56  <bhasker> girl
2011-04-25T22:28:02  <bhasker> sleeping next to me like a little angel
2011-04-25T22:28:03  <McLeopold> congrats
2011-04-25T22:28:04  <antimatroid> akshara?
2011-04-25T22:28:08  <bhasker> yup :)
2011-04-25T22:28:10  <bhasker> akshara!
2011-04-25T22:28:10  <antimatroid> i'm determined to remember a name for once
2011-04-25T22:28:21  <McLeopold> They sure look creepy when the first come out, don't they?
2011-04-25T22:28:25  <jaycobcoleman> I believe it was akshara you said? :)
2011-04-25T22:28:26  <bhasker> she is a handful and has a personality
2011-04-25T22:28:28  <antimatroid> i hear cone headish?
2011-04-25T22:28:43  <bhasker> not really ours was a health 3.4 kgs :)
2011-04-25T22:28:44  <McLeopold> more like alien head
2011-04-25T22:28:50  <bhasker> so she was actually quite plump
2011-04-25T22:28:52  <bhasker> but yea the head
2011-04-25T22:28:54  <antimatroid> yeah, gotta get that thing through :P
2011-04-25T22:28:55  <bhasker> is more conical
2011-04-25T22:29:00  <McLeopold> and they are grey and purple until the start breathing
2011-04-25T22:29:03  <bhasker> it rounds up
2011-04-25T22:29:07  <bhasker> yup and a little blue
2011-04-25T22:29:20  <bhasker> its an awesome feeling to hold her though
2011-04-25T22:29:34  <antimatroid> i also hear some babies need to have a new a hole ripped for them, but maybe i shouldn't go there
2011-04-25T22:29:36  <McLeopold> It only gets better
2011-04-25T22:29:48  <bhasker> :)
2011-04-25T22:29:58  <antimatroid> yes, i'be been given him hell about the lack of sleep that's coming, but all in all it'd be awesome having a kid
2011-04-25T22:30:17  <bhasker> last 4 nights have been quite sleepless:)
2011-04-25T22:30:22  <McLeopold> we got lucky and he slept 6-8 hours at night right away
2011-04-25T22:30:31  <bhasker> ours seems to be a day sleeper
2011-04-25T22:30:44  <bhasker> she's been sleeping like an angel for last 3-4 hrs
2011-04-25T22:31:02  <bhasker> yesterday night it was crazy she cried like nonstop 1-2 hrs
2011-04-25T22:31:09  <bhasker> and it was almost impossible to console her
2011-04-25T22:31:29  <bhasker> took like 4 people trying in rounds, and finally she settled down a bit with my father in law
2011-04-25T22:31:35  <antimatroid> cryers gonna cry
2011-04-25T22:31:49  * jmcarthur facepalms
2011-04-25T22:31:49  <bhasker> mcleopold how old is your son
2011-04-25T22:31:51  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: speaking of strategy (it was a while ago). Now that you're talking, what theories do you want included in strategy guides?
2011-04-25T22:31:58  <McLeopold> 1 year, 1 month
2011-04-25T22:32:05  <bhasker> ah nice must have started walking
2011-04-25T22:32:10  <bhasker> fun times
2011-04-25T22:32:11  <McLeopold> yep
2011-04-25T22:32:12  <antimatroid> jaycbocoleman: are you planning to add to them, feel free to add anything
2011-04-25T22:32:18  <bhasker> things move higher in the house now
2011-04-25T22:32:31  <McLeopold> yeah, you adjust slowly
2011-04-25T22:32:33  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: was that directed at me?
2011-04-25T22:32:40  <bhasker> <-- has lotsa RTS experience
2011-04-25T22:32:46  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-04-25T22:32:50  <antimatroid> :p
2011-04-25T22:32:58  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: What's in there so far?
2011-04-25T22:33:16  <antimatroid> erm.. good question, hang on
2011-04-25T22:34:05  <McLeopold> jaycobcoleman: 1) how to not collide your own ants 2) how to find a path in a maze
2011-04-25T22:34:14  <bhasker> warcraft 1/2/3, starcraft 1/2, TA, TACC, Supcom 1/2, AOE 1/2/3, C&C 1/2, C&C Red Alert1/2, Kohan, Total War, Ground Control,UAW
2011-04-25T22:34:29  <jaycobcoleman> alright, anything else?
2011-04-25T22:34:31  <bhasker> mcleopold  i have a nice c++ function to extract a path
2011-04-25T22:34:39  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Strategy-Guide
2011-04-25T22:34:41  <McLeopold> bhasker: no CC Generals?
2011-04-25T22:34:48  <bhasker> no never liked it
2011-04-25T22:35:05  <bhasker> i kind of got bored of C&C franchise
2011-04-25T22:35:07  <bhasker> too static
2011-04-25T22:35:11  <bhasker> and not much change in game play
2011-04-25T22:35:12  <antimatroid> that is a more general strategy guide
2011-04-25T22:35:18  <bhasker> i think Supcom is awesome
2011-04-25T22:35:20  <bhasker> Supcom2 is okay
2011-04-25T22:35:22  <antimatroid> i can't find one if i've done it yet for a few simple improvements
2011-04-25T22:35:32  <bhasker> Supcom Forged Alliance is still one of the best RTS
2011-04-25T22:35:49  <McLeopold> I always liked Warcraft 2's split between land and sea.  I can't think of another game that has that
2011-04-25T22:35:57  <bhasker> supcom has land/sea/air
2011-04-25T22:36:02  <bhasker> one of the few that has a proper air
2011-04-25T22:36:07  <bhasker> not like the hovering types
2011-04-25T22:36:12  <bhasker> but real planes/bombers etc
2011-04-25T22:36:34  <bhasker> and full fleet of destroyers/subs/antisubs/frigates/air craft carriers/battleships
2011-04-25T22:36:37  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what do you think about starting people out with like 3 seconds per turn?
2011-04-25T22:36:41  <McLeopold> I used to create maps where you had to build ships to cross a river to get more resources, then had to do it again to get to the enemy
2011-04-25T22:36:42  <bhasker> if you haven't played Supcom you should
2011-04-25T22:36:48  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: I'll try to add some more body to the guides
2011-04-25T22:36:58  *** computerwiz_222 <computerwiz_222!~andrew@69-165-158-142.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)

2011-04-25T22:37:07  <McLeopold> yes
2011-04-25T22:37:14  <bhasker> what about Supcom
2011-04-25T22:37:19  <McLeopold> I really liked the resources as flow rates idea
2011-04-25T22:37:21  <bhasker> if you liked TA
2011-04-25T22:37:24  <bhasker> you would love supcom
2011-04-25T22:37:30  <bhasker> supcom2 is more like starcraft
2011-04-25T22:37:31  <jaycobcoleman> Grrrr. You can have it
2011-04-25T22:37:32  <McLeopold> haven't played supcom
2011-04-25T22:37:38  <McLeopold> antimatroid: no on 3 seconds
2011-04-25T22:37:39  <bhasker> Try it
2011-04-25T22:37:42  <bhasker> even though its 4yrs old now
2011-04-25T22:37:45  <antimatroid> bhasker: did you ever play future cop lapd on sony playstation?
2011-04-25T22:37:49  <bhasker> it still kicks starcraft2s ass
2011-04-25T22:37:55  <bhasker> i hate playing games on the ps3
2011-04-25T22:37:56  <antimatroid> McLeopold: people are going to be really limited on what they can do
2011-04-25T22:38:05  <bhasker> hate having to use the gamepad
2011-04-25T22:38:12  <bhasker> keyboard + mouse>  gamepad
2011-04-25T22:38:13  <bhasker> anyday
2011-04-25T22:38:27  <bhasker> my ps3 nowdays is more of a netflix player/blueray player
2011-04-25T22:38:29  <antimatroid> sony playstation 1
2011-04-25T22:38:34  <antimatroid> it is an old awesome game
2011-04-25T22:38:38  <bhasker> doh never had one, i was never much of a console gamer
2011-04-25T22:38:45  <bhasker> always been more of a pc gamer
2011-04-25T22:38:46  <antimatroid> netiher
2011-04-25T22:38:54  <antimatroid> i don't really play video games now at all
2011-04-25T22:39:05  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: I'll probably just try writing a guide as a whole and then give you a link to pastebin and you can add your thoughts/edit
2011-04-25T22:39:31  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I think any naive algo for this game will quickly surpase time and memory limits
2011-04-25T22:39:34  <bhasker> i have quite a few ideas for ants , wonder how many i will be able to implement
2011-04-25T22:39:34  <jaycobcoleman> pcs are way to hard to keep at good gaming standards
2011-04-25T22:39:51  <jaycobcoleman> *too
2011-04-25T22:39:55  <bhasker> pcs games are way more complex and nicer
2011-04-25T22:39:55  <antimatroid> McLeopold: sure, but i'm talking about top bots being able to do anything cool
2011-04-25T22:40:05  <antimatroid> it's just going to be who can do the most in the shortest amount of time
2011-04-25T22:40:14  <antimatroid> not who can do the coolest stuff
2011-04-25T22:40:17  <bhasker> i hate playing multiple player games on ps3 because team coordination is  a mess
2011-04-25T22:40:18  <jaycobcoleman> bhasker: this was true, not so sure anymore
2011-04-25T22:40:24  <bhasker> without voice
2011-04-25T22:40:29  <bhasker> ps3 games still suck compared to pc
2011-04-25T22:40:37  <bhasker> i wouldn't touch a single mmo designed for ps3
2011-04-25T22:40:45  <bhasker> or a first person shooter
2011-04-25T22:40:50  <antimatroid> i'm also a bit concerned about my possible strategy idea of taking up memory at the start of the game and not releasing it
2011-04-25T22:40:52  <McLeopold> antimatroid: convince janzert, then I'll listen on the 3 seconds
2011-04-25T22:40:53  <jaycobcoleman> sony has a crappy community
2011-04-25T22:41:00  <bhasker> an FPS on ps3 is like shooting oneself
2011-04-25T22:41:06  <bhasker> or any console for that matter
2011-04-25T22:41:15  <bhasker> keyboard + mouse > controller
2011-04-25T22:41:18  <bhasker> for an FPS
2011-04-25T22:41:19  <bhasker> or an RTS
2011-04-25T22:41:23  <bhasker> or an MMMO
2011-04-25T22:41:38  <antimatroid> is there a way to limit how much memory a bot can use?
2011-04-25T22:41:45  <jaycobcoleman> I would echo your sentiments
2011-04-25T22:41:45  <jaycobcoleman> but still more money :P
2011-04-25T22:42:02  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: Do you want to?

2011-04-25T22:46:36  <jaycobcoleman> no I
2011-04-25T22:47:52  <antimatroid> i do
2011-04-25T22:48:06  <antimatroid> i would like to give each bot a fair share of the servers memory resources
2011-04-25T22:48:25  <antimatroid> not make it a memory wars contest in turn 0
2011-04-25T22:48:33  <antimatroid> where people fight to take up the most memory and don't release any of it
2011-04-25T22:49:15  <McLeopold> I should have done that in planet wars :(
2011-04-25T22:49:15  <jaycobcoleman> I don't think the allotted time allows us to take up more memory than there is to go around
2011-04-25T22:49:28  <jaycobcoleman> or does it?

2011-04-25T22:50:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: me too, but seriously, it think that might be an issue if we have lots of bots on the one machine
2011-04-25T22:50:17  <antimatroid> and it's not really a memory wars, as one bot gets to go first with turn 0 i believe?
2011-04-25T22:51:10  <McLeopold> I think we can limit memory, I remember reading some python jail code that did that, but I'm not sure how robust it was
2011-04-25T22:52:46  <jaycobcoleman> It's certainly possible
2011-04-25T22:54:14  <antimatroid> we'd need to pass bots their memory limit as a parameter
2011-04-25T22:54:39  <antimatroid> and tracking how much memory you have used probably isn't the easiest thing in the world?
2011-04-25T22:54:49  <antimatroid> how many bots are we planning to run on a server at a time?

2011-04-25T22:59:29  <McLeopold> just getting started for the night
2011-04-25T23:00:08  <McLeopold> I'm wondering if we can use ulimit to limit a bot's memory usage
2011-04-25T23:01:29  <antimatroid> amstan: i noticed the specs page looks a lot nicer now :)
2011-04-25T23:01:44  <antimatroid> the LaTeX stuff is still wrong, but we can work out what to do with that later
2011-04-25T23:01:46  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, bullets and code stuff
2011-04-25T23:02:03  <amstan> antimatroid: i got a pointer from sigh about it, i think i'll use pandoc instead of simple markdown
2011-04-25T23:02:25  <antimatroid> you also managed to avoid to dreaded space on the first line of "code" stuff

2011-04-25T23:02:36  <antimatroid> on github wikis it forces a space there
2011-04-25T23:02:51  <antimatroid> it's terribly annoying :P
2011-04-25T23:03:00  <McLeopold> are we using pandoc in the github wiki? is it a markup language?
2011-04-25T23:03:13  <amstan> McLeopold: it's a thing that reads markdown files
2011-04-25T23:03:21  <McLeopold> oh
2011-04-25T23:03:28  <amstan> antimatroid: i cannot change th rendering engine from the wiki, it's github's stuff
2011-04-25T23:03:33  <McLeopold> amstan: did you see my note on including ant maps in wiki text?
2011-04-25T23:03:41  <amstan> McLeopold: nope, where?
2011-04-25T23:03:50  <McLeopold> on irc earlier
2011-04-25T23:04:00  <antimatroid> amstan: i know, i'm just pointing out how much nicer it is on the site without the space
2011-04-25T23:04:17  <amstan> antimatroid: oh, cool
2011-04-25T23:04:18  <amstan> lol
2011-04-25T23:04:22  <McLeopold> the question is, can pan doc use plugins, and can markdown allow us to markup pluging stuff?
2011-04-25T23:04:39  <amstan> McLeopold: yes pandoc is written in haskell, can do latex and stuff
2011-04-25T23:05:01  <antimatroid> is there a way to carry across old user accounts for the new contest?
2011-04-25T23:05:15  <antimatroid> so people have rights to their account?
2011-04-25T23:05:45  <antimatroid> least some troll decide to go through and just register all the "top" usernames
2011-04-25T23:06:12  <McLeopold> antimatroid: we changed the password hash, so it would take some work
2011-04-25T23:06:19  <amstan> antimatroid: that's no, because we store the passwords in a diff format now
2011-04-25T23:06:27  <antimatroid> okay
2011-04-25T23:06:30  <amstan> unless we code something to migrate
2011-04-25T23:06:36  <antimatroid> i'll add that to my list of things i want for zeta
2011-04-25T23:06:49  <McLeopold> it wouldn't be to hard, try hash 1, then try hash 2 and force a password reset
2011-04-25T23:07:06  <amstan> antimatroid: can we see that list?
2011-04-25T23:07:17  <antimatroid> i have lots of hypothetical lists
2011-04-25T23:07:19  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah
2011-04-25T23:07:22  <antimatroid> i just refer to them as though they actually exist
2011-04-25T23:07:31  <antimatroid> i have a very long to learn list
2011-04-25T23:07:37  <McLeopold> we could switch to openid now and not worry
2011-04-25T23:07:43  <amstan> antimatroid: stuff like these should be issues
2011-04-25T23:07:52  <antimatroid> one issue is people not wanting their old username and someone else wanting that
2011-04-25T23:08:19  <amstan> i would expect such users to come over and ask us to do stuff manually for them
2011-04-25T23:08:25  <amstan> including cases of stolen usernames
2011-04-25T23:08:28  <antimatroid> or people not remembering their old password and can't correctly verify it's them
2011-04-25T23:08:33  <amstan> i don't think we have to worry too much about that
2011-04-25T23:08:41  <janzert> btw, bots are limited to just over 1GB of memory
2011-04-25T23:08:56  <antimatroid> janzert: but how much memory do we have if we run 10+ player games?
2011-04-25T23:09:10  <janzert> depends on the servers we use :P
2011-04-25T23:09:33  <janzert> I'm looking at I believe it was 17.5GB instances
2011-04-25T23:09:58  <janzert> 17.1
2011-04-25T23:09:59  <antimatroid> so memory has really never been a problem?
2011-04-25T23:10:03  <antimatroid> that's cool
2011-04-25T23:10:26  <janzert> if we can use serialized running and that instance type it should work out fine
2011-04-25T23:10:40  <antimatroid> let's cap players at 16 and promise 1gb?
2011-04-25T23:10:45  <janzert> there are only two cores on that instance type so it won't work without serialized running
2011-04-25T23:10:55  <amstan> antimatroid: why is memory such an issue?
2011-04-25T23:11:03  <antimatroid> amstan: i just want to make sure it isn't
2011-04-25T23:11:16  <antimatroid> and i expect game tree's to be popular again in this, so memory will be used
2011-04-25T23:11:29  <antimatroid> although i decided not to use games trees last night
2011-04-25T23:11:35  <antimatroid> i'm going to iteratively make normal form games
2011-04-25T23:11:39  <amstan> if we can't give them 1gb, then it'll start swapping
2011-04-25T23:11:59  <amstan> and if we count cpu time, it shouldn't disadvantage the player because of that
2011-04-25T23:12:18  <antimatroid> if we have 17.5gb and can cap them at 1gb then we can guarantee them that?
2011-04-25T23:12:29  <janzert> nobody has come up with a cpu timer yet
2011-04-25T23:12:38  <amstan> most will probably not use 1 full gb
2011-04-25T23:12:38  <antimatroid> or we can guarantee 500mb and keep the 26 player limit
2011-04-25T23:12:44  <antimatroid> we have SIGSTOP now yeah?
2011-04-25T23:12:55  <janzert> sigh has it in a branch
2011-04-25T23:13:02  <janzert> I don't know how much it was tested
2011-04-25T23:13:15  <antimatroid> good thing for the beta period imo
2011-04-25T23:13:21  <antimatroid> i would really like to have that used
2011-04-25T23:13:43  <janzert> i.e. the first question I have is whether a sub-process is stopped when the parent is?
2011-04-25T23:13:48  <sigh> i'm mostly waiting until someone tells me the code is alright, because I haven't done this stuff before
2011-04-25T23:14:56  <janzert> sigh: also I was wondering how hard does it get for you two run some number of players in parallel, say 2 at a time?
2011-04-25T23:15:06  <janzert> that would be really awesome if possible
2011-04-25T23:15:20  <janzert> we could get really good resource usage then
2011-04-25T23:15:35  <sigh> what do you mean by hard?
2011-04-25T23:15:37  <janzert> s/two/to
2011-04-25T23:15:55  <sigh> it becomes harder to make it "fair"
2011-04-25T23:16:13  <janzert> e.g. say there are 12 players in the game, instead of fully serialized I want to run 2 at a time
2011-04-25T23:16:18  <sigh> that's easy
2011-04-25T23:16:31  <antimatroid> janzert: what are your thoughts about a >1 second time limit per bot?
2011-04-25T23:16:33  <janzert> for each turn the two that run simultaneously should be shuffled
2011-04-25T23:16:37  <sigh> there's a function which takes a list of bots and runs them in parallel
2011-04-25T23:16:43  <janzert> great
2011-04-25T23:16:46  <antimatroid> would mean the games take quite a lot longer, but would also mean people can actually do some cool stuff
2011-04-25T23:16:56  <sigh> so for parallel mode it does all of them, for serial it is given one at a time
2011-04-25T23:17:00  <antimatroid> another alternative might be less ants / smaller maps
2011-04-25T23:17:04  <janzert> antimatroid: we're already much more resource intensive per game I'd rather not add to it
2011-04-25T23:17:36  <janzert> we expect the games to run longer and be able to play less games at a time
2011-04-25T23:18:13  <antimatroid> really we've so far doubled the amount of time it takes for 2 bots to take a turn yeah?
2011-04-25T23:18:25  <antimatroid> before it was 2 bots every 1 second, now it's 1 bot every 1 second
2011-04-25T23:18:42  <janzert> the instance type I mentioned with the 17GB of ram is 4+ times as expensive as the last contest workers
2011-04-25T23:19:16  <janzert> we were running 4 bots in parallel per worker, now it is 1 or 2
2011-04-25T23:19:44  <antimatroid> but 2 bots had a processor to themselves yeah?
2011-04-25T23:19:47  <janzert> the max game length was 200 now it is 1000
2011-04-25T23:19:58  <antimatroid> yeah and there's that
2011-04-25T23:19:59  <antimatroid> :P
2011-04-25T23:20:31  <janzert> good thing is it was 2 bots per game now it is 4-16 or something
2011-04-25T23:20:58  <antimatroid> i think really 3-6 players will be plenty to get multiplayer
2011-04-25T23:21:10  <janzert> but I believe still on balance this is going to be less bots playing per unit of time per worker
2011-04-25T23:21:54  <janzert> well, per dollar spent on a worker
2011-04-25T23:23:08  <antimatroid> we probably don't want to run the contest for any longer than we did too
2011-04-25T23:24:06  <janzert> anyway back to the engine, I'd like to see the engine have a mode where it will run n players in parallel with basically shuffling the player list every move so the players that are paired together get randomized and n set to the number of cores in the worker
2011-04-25T23:24:23  <janzert> I think 2 months is probably a good length
2011-04-25T23:26:02  <antimatroid> i meant the final contest sorry :P
2011-04-25T23:26:12  <janzert> ahh
2011-04-25T23:26:44  <antimatroid> so each player gets a core each?
2011-04-25T23:26:49  <janzert> yes
2011-04-25T23:27:15  <janzert> which is more than they got before ;)
2011-04-25T23:27:21  <antimatroid> that would be ideal
2011-04-25T23:27:27  <antimatroid> i know :P
2011-04-25T23:28:47  <janzert> if someone is looking for something to do for the contest, another thing that would be nice is to see if there is a way to make java run with less threads
2011-04-25T23:29:00  <antimatroid> loljava :P
2011-04-25T23:29:11  <janzert> seems that it won't even start up with a limit of 10 threads :(
2011-04-25T23:29:19  <janzert> which is rather ridiculous
2011-04-25T23:30:46  <antimatroid> what isn't very trivial is finding sets of ants that might affect each other in battle
2011-04-25T23:31:01  <antimatroid> water information can make it complicated if you want to get the correct partitions
2011-04-25T23:44:52  <amstan> McLeopold: tell me if the css gets in the way, i haven't been able to test the table css because i didn't have any rankings anywhere
2011-04-25T23:45:17  <McLeopold> you can use my sql script to generate fake info
2011-04-25T23:45:42  <amstan> McLeopold: yay, where?
2011-04-25T23:46:00  <McLeopold> amstan: sql/create_test_bot.py actually calls the create test data function
2011-04-25T23:46:17  <McLeopold> I have another script to randomize mu and sigma data...
2011-04-25T23:46:52  <amstan> McLeopold: what db info does it use?
2011-04-25T23:47:37  <McLeopold> it pulls from the server_info.py, so just copy it to the directory
2011-04-25T23:47:58  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@210.18.207.102> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 241 seconds)
2011-04-25T23:48:17  <McLeopold> it creates 10,000 users and 30,000 games by default, so you may want to turn that down a little

2011-04-25T23:50:10  <janzert> yep
2011-04-25T23:50:33  <amstan> McLeopold: matchup_count?
2011-04-25T23:50:34  <antimatroid> were any of you the ones to email him to get more maps added to his tcp?

2011-04-25T23:54:27  <antimatroid> i would expect less games with this?
2011-04-25T23:54:31  <McLeopold> then crap, I may have to review the matchmaking sql

2011-04-25T23:54:57  <janzert> antimatroid: yeah, most likely in the finals

2011-04-25T23:55:46  <McLeopold> yes, a new python one
2011-04-25T23:55:53  <antimatroid> oh joy :)
2011-04-25T23:56:19  <_flag> Does the "beta launch" objective on the issues page on github mean the contest will be officially announced on the site?
2011-04-25T23:56:37  <amstan> _flag: no
2011-04-25T23:56:54  <amstan> _flag: ideally we should have stuff done on our test server, a fully working competition there

2011-04-25T23:57:58  <_flag> amstan: So would the actual launch soon follow? Do we have an expected start date for the contest?
2011-04-25T23:58:13  <amstan> _flag: no, we'll decide after we see the state of beta
2011-04-25T23:58:29  <amstan> _flag: but yes.. it should follow soon

2011-04-25T23:59:24  <janzert> for reference beta for planetwars was roughly 2 weeks I believe
2011-04-25T23:59:37  <_flag> amstan: okay, thanks -- I also noticed there was an issue about my example bot in my starter pack, that was the original starter bot but I wasn't aware the starter bot had to follow a spec so you can just delete it.
2011-04-25T23:59:49  <antimatroid> planetwars just beta'd in competition if i recall? :P
