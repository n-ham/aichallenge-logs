2011-03-07T00:00:07  <janzert> do you have bss03's latest version of the matchmaking page open?
2011-03-07T00:00:10  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-03-07T00:00:17  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-07T00:01:19  <McLeopold> I don't like the "at random" part.
2011-03-07T00:01:25  <janzert> I really don't want to disqualify any submissions after they've entered the contest unless they are causing actual problems with the servers
2011-03-07T00:01:34  <McLeopold> You don't really do that in sql with any effeciency.
2011-03-07T00:02:45  <McLeopold> it's kinda wordy...
2011-03-07T00:02:53  <janzert> since it's only used to break ties getting rid of it shouldn't be effect much
2011-03-07T00:03:11  <janzert> anyway in the future section
2011-03-07T00:03:13  <McLeopold> where do you see disqualify?
2011-03-07T00:03:31  <janzert> it's not in the page anymore
2011-03-07T00:03:44  <janzert> I noticed it in your old page
2011-03-07T00:03:47  <janzert> but anyway
2011-03-07T00:04:05  <McLeopold> that was probably the "functional test game"
2011-03-07T00:04:14  <janzert> in the future section I'd like to get rid of the first choice for seed the seed player
2011-03-07T00:04:15  <McLeopold> I just didn't explain it well.
2011-03-07T00:04:41  <janzert> so the seed is always based on user not submission basically
2011-03-07T00:05:19  <McLeopold> new submission should come first, the cooldown prevents spamming
2011-03-07T00:05:20  <janzert> then you don't need to worry about a pairing/resubmission cooldown at all and spamming submissions doesn't give you any value
2011-03-07T00:05:55  <janzert> any cooldown shorter than the time to play your next match gives you an incentive to spam
2011-03-07T00:06:02  <McLeopold> true...
2011-03-07T00:06:19  <janzert> at which point just go by player instead of submission and be done with it
2011-03-07T00:07:07  <bss03-AFK> The "at random" just means I take the first row the DB outputs.
2011-03-07T00:07:14  <bss03-AFK> That why it is "random".
2011-03-07T00:07:23  <McLeopold> put in an order by and define the criteria
2011-03-07T00:07:33  <amstan> bss03-AFK: ugh.. stop using afk nicks.. irc has /away
2011-03-07T00:07:39  <McLeopold> (which is submission_id, aka timestamp)
2011-03-07T00:07:49  <bss03-AFK> I use the timestamp.
2011-03-07T00:07:53  <McLeopold> nothing happend
2011-03-07T00:08:07  <bss03-AFK> That en I say, If there are ties (unlikely) I take whatever the DB gives first.
2011-03-07T00:08:12  *** bss03-AFK is now known as bss03
2011-03-07T00:08:35  <McLeopold> you can't have a tie with a unique id
2011-03-07T00:09:39  <bss03> I don't think we actually want to prefer thier earlier or later submissions, so I'm hesitant to order by submission_id.
2011-03-07T00:10:06  <McLeopold> a single users earlier/later?
2011-03-07T00:10:18  <McLeopold> or the set of all new submissions?
2011-03-07T00:10:31  <bss03> There's no going to be a lot of ties that are resolved at "random" anyway.  Usually my last comparision is either a timestamp or a trueskill match quality.
2011-03-07T00:11:01  <McLeopold> don't use timestamp, use unique ids
2011-03-07T00:11:06  <bss03> Set of all submissions.  Of course we only want to use the latest submission for most stuff.
2011-03-07T00:12:09  <janzert> where are you using a timestamp that submission_id wouldn't give the same ordering (except in the case of a tie for the timestamp of course)?
2011-03-07T00:12:26  <bss03> Comparing timestamps is virtually required.
2011-03-07T00:12:37  <bss03> Would you rather I went by game_id?
2011-03-07T00:12:40  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-07T00:12:50  <McLeopold> unique_id's are in order of time anyway
2011-03-07T00:12:57  <McLeopold> and integers are faster
2011-03-07T00:13:14  <McLeopold> I don't want to index timestamps
2011-03-07T00:13:42  <bss03> Well, unique id aren't guaranteed to increase monotonically as time does.
2011-03-07T00:13:51  <McLeopold> btw, I glad you've been putting in the work you have, it is looking good so far.
2011-03-07T00:14:02  <bss03> But, I'm not gonna fight on that point.  game_id or somesuch is fine.
2011-03-07T00:14:45  <McLeopold> I think they are, if I know what monotonically means.
2011-03-07T00:14:53  <McLeopold> you always count up
2011-03-07T00:15:06  <bss03> Now, I really must get to bed.  "Wake up call" in 7 hours.
2011-03-07T00:15:25  <McLeopold> k, cya
2011-03-07T00:15:27  <bss03> RDBMSes are allowed to re-use unique ids that are not longer in the table.
2011-03-07T00:15:29  <janzert> I think they're a reason they're also called autoincrement
2011-03-07T00:15:39  <McLeopold> we won't be doing that
2011-03-07T00:15:41  <bss03> Most don't.
2011-03-07T00:15:44  <janzert> there's
2011-03-07T00:16:05  <McLeopold> the mysql auto_inc does a max() on the table
2011-03-07T00:16:20  <bss03> MySQL autoincrement in particular doesn't -- it just does max() + 1.
2011-03-07T00:17:02  <janzert> which is exactly what we need to guarantee right?
2011-03-07T00:17:10  <McLeopold> yes, so id's will work
2011-03-07T00:17:36  <bss03> Yeah, game_id will work fine.  I'm a theoretical purest though.
2011-03-07T00:17:44  <bss03> Why do you think I learned Haskell? ;)
2011-03-07T00:17:50  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-07T00:17:51  <bss03> Night all.
2011-03-07T00:17:54  <McLeopold> night
2011-03-07T00:17:56  <janzert> :)
2011-03-07T00:17:58  <janzert> goodnight
2011-03-07T00:18:03  <janzert> again :P
2011-03-07T00:20:59  <janzert> so the main server setup script minimally works installing stuff and setting up apache to serve up pages
2011-03-07T00:21:37  <janzert> but I'm going to wait to add anything about setting up cron jobs until the new scripts are done since it appears they are all changing names anyway
2011-03-07T00:22:32  <janzert> so now I just need to give it a good dose of flexibility :P
2011-03-07T00:24:29  <McLeopold> we still using compile_anything?
2011-03-07T00:24:56  <janzert> on the main server? depends on what you mean by still
2011-03-07T00:25:08  <McLeopold> can markdown blocks be given a language syntax for highlighting?
2011-03-07T00:25:15  <McLeopold> for the workers to compile
2011-03-07T00:25:21  <janzert> it was in planetwars, once compilation is moved to the workers no
2011-03-07T00:25:29  <janzert> yes, I believe so
2011-03-07T00:26:18  <janzert> or it will for sure once the workers do compilation unless we want to fully jump ship and just use compile.sh/run.sh scripts for all submissions
2011-03-07T00:26:44  <janzert> I'm not quite sure whether I'm ready or not to go that far
2011-03-07T00:27:29  <McLeopold> let's assume no compile.sh for now
2011-03-07T00:29:25  <janzert> yeah, then the worker will need compile_anything
2011-03-07T00:31:01  <janzert> are you ok with simply choosing seed players in least recently played order?

2011-03-07T00:33:07  <McLeopold> I would like to try and give players not spamming some leeway, but we can do that later.
2011-03-07T00:33:45  <McLeopold> oh no, but yes

2011-03-07T02:03:59  <janzert> well it looks like it also has safe_mode off and open_basedir none :}
2011-03-07T02:05:03  <McLeopold> yeah, i'm fixing safe mode off issues as well :(
2011-03-07T02:05:18  <McLeopold> not familiar with open_basedir yet
2011-03-07T02:05:47  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I'm unsure about your format for "space"
2011-03-07T02:06:06  <antimatroid> you might end up with losts of (0,1,2): x, (0,2,4): x etc. situations?
2011-03-07T02:06:18  <janzert> restricts where php scripts can open files, sort of a php specific chroot I believe
2011-03-07T02:06:25  <janzert> none simply disables
2011-03-07T02:08:16  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes, there might be lots of combos
2011-03-07T02:08:34  <antimatroid> okay, well i'll update that in a bit then make everthing functions and i think it's done
2011-03-07T02:08:59  <McLeopold> okay, add_maps_to_database will import the function
2011-03-07T02:09:49  <antimatroid> so could i really just throw everything i have as "main" now into a function called analyze_map?
2011-03-07T02:09:49  <McLeopold> with the combos, I can know how much space player X can get to first, and just as fast as all others, etc.
2011-03-07T02:10:12  <McLeopold> I can just add up the numbers I'm interested in.
2011-03-07T02:10:24  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-07T02:10:43  <antimatroid> it was a little tricky working out how to calculate who can get where first, but i think what i have now is general
2011-03-07T02:11:02  <McLeopold> I saw the pictures, they looked cool.
2011-03-07T02:11:19  <antimatroid> actually, i need to make a couple of changes to make sure it can handle each player starting with more than one ant
2011-03-07T02:11:23  <antimatroid> i think that's ideal?
2011-03-07T02:11:30  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-07T02:11:39  <McLeopold> I hope to have multiple start maps
2011-03-07T02:11:42  <antimatroid> they're small changes anyway, just adding a line or two in places

2011-03-07T03:14:44  <McLeopold> so, no squares equidistant to 3 or more?
2011-03-07T03:15:00  <antimatroid> not in that map, but it's easy to construct a situation where it will happen
2011-03-07T03:15:13  <antimatroid> i think i could potentially get 8+ players at an equidistance
2011-03-07T03:15:33  <antimatroid> i'm using shortest paths for players to find "access", not euclidean distance
2011-03-07T03:16:45  <antimatroid> i should probably check that each player has the same number of starting ants and enforce that?
2011-03-07T03:18:11  <antimatroid> boy kinder surprise toys don't require much construction these days
2011-03-07T03:18:13  <McLeopold> just stats, no enforement

2011-03-07T03:18:51  <antimatroid> erm, whenever something has been wrong i've been raising a ValueError?

2011-03-07T03:20:42  <McLeopold> maybe it was old?

2011-03-07T03:21:37  <antimatroid> milo is more awesome
2011-03-07T03:21:56  <sigh> also ferrero rocher
2011-03-07T03:21:59  <McLeopold> ValueError is the map is not valid.  Having extra starting spots can be a valid map, just unfair.
2011-03-07T03:22:14  <antimatroid> i'm not sure whether knowing the center of a ferrero rocher makes that worse or nutella better
2011-03-07T03:22:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: okay, done
2011-03-07T03:22:50  <antimatroid> center is just nutella***
2011-03-07T03:22:57  <McLeopold> maybe a 'starts' list in the dict then
2011-03-07T03:23:10  <antimatroid> already on it :)
2011-03-07T03:24:44  <antimatroid> can i tell python to take two lists and sort them both but by ordering the first list?
2011-03-07T03:25:06  <antimatroid> or have i shot myself in the foot?
2011-03-07T03:27:39  <sigh> what do you mean?
2011-03-07T03:29:12  <sigh> do you mean this: x,y = zip(*sorted(zip(x,y)))
2011-03-07T03:32:25  <antimatroid> will that just sort y elements the same way it sorts x elements?
2011-03-07T03:32:32  <sigh> yes
2011-03-07T03:32:41  <antimatroid> i'll see how i go
2011-03-07T03:33:52  <antimatroid> poo, didn't sort it how i wanted :(
2011-03-07T03:34:30  <sigh> can you give an example of what you want?
2011-03-07T03:38:32  <antimatroid> sigh: http://codepad.org/O1VS6olf
2011-03-07T03:38:50  <antimatroid> i would want 0, 1, 2, (0,1), etc., not 0, (0,1), 1, 2 etc.
2011-03-07T03:39:10  <antimatroid> your method worked sorry
2011-03-07T03:39:16  <antimatroid> i was referring to the general sort :)
2011-03-07T03:39:34  <sigh> i'm confused
2011-03-07T03:40:09  <sigh> oh ok, you don't like how python is comparing objects
2011-03-07T03:40:20  <antimatroid> i'm not hating this time
2011-03-07T03:40:21  <sigh> you can pass your own compare function into sorted
2011-03-07T03:40:37  <antimatroid> just it didn't happen to work the way that would have currently been convenient
2011-03-07T03:41:47  <sigh> hmm... my python says that 0 < 1 < 2 < (0,1) is True
2011-03-07T03:41:53  <sigh> which is what you said you wanted?
2011-03-07T03:42:13  <antimatroid> hmm i just called list.sort() and got that
2011-03-07T03:42:26  <antimatroid> oh wait
2011-03-07T03:42:39  <antimatroid> try 1 < (0,1)?
2011-03-07T03:42:44  <sigh> True
2011-03-07T03:42:48  <antimatroid> nah, that should be fine, nevermind me
2011-03-07T03:42:52  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-03-07T03:42:56  <sigh> ok...
2011-03-07T03:45:49  <antimatroid> oh, i am using lists :P
2011-03-07T03:45:55  <antimatroid> my output is using ()'s
2011-03-07T03:46:35  <antimatroid> can i "press" a list into a tuple?
2011-03-07T03:46:43  <sigh> press?
2011-03-07T03:46:51  <sigh> x,y = zip(*sorted(zip(x,y)))
2011-03-07T03:46:54  <sigh> sorry
2011-03-07T03:47:08  <sigh> either convert x,y manually or you can x,y = map(list,zip(*sorted(zip(x,y))))
2011-03-07T03:47:08  <antimatroid> like, make [1,2] = (1,2)
2011-03-07T03:47:15  <sigh> list(x)
2011-03-07T03:47:29  <McLeopold> tuple(list)
2011-03-07T03:48:08  <sigh> i suggested just doing: x,y = list(x), list(y)
2011-03-07T03:48:16  <sigh> clearest
2011-03-07T03:48:20  <antimatroid> that wont help me :P
2011-03-07T03:48:36  <antimatroid> i need to convert a list of lists into a list of tuples, not too bad
2011-03-07T03:48:43  <antimatroid> then sort should just work for me
2011-03-07T03:48:57  <sigh> map(tuple, x)
2011-03-07T03:48:58  <McLeopold> [tuple(x) for x in list]
2011-03-07T03:49:06  <sigh> I win
2011-03-07T03:50:15  <McLeopold> not in python 3 :)
2011-03-07T03:50:36  <sigh> oh, what does python 3 do?
2011-03-07T03:51:00  <McLeopold> list(map(tuple, x))
2011-03-07T03:51:10  <McLeopold> but yeah, i forget about map and zip all the time
2011-03-07T03:51:36  <McLeopold> python 3 is lazy and give you an iterator
2011-03-07T03:51:42  <sigh> fair enough
2011-03-07T03:51:55  <sigh> map is fun but crappy lambdas make it less useful
2011-03-07T03:53:13  <McLeopold> no lambda in p3k
2011-03-07T03:54:04  <McLeopold> dammit, they added back in, wrong again
2011-03-07T03:54:54  <sigh> haha, I was hunting docs to verify that :P
2011-03-07T04:00:01  <antimatroid> now python is just trolling me :\
2011-03-07T04:00:16  <antimatroid> i get the same logic response as sigh with a simple if, but if i sort by the tuples, same result :\
2011-03-07T04:00:35  <antimatroid> me thinks python sort isn't just using <?
2011-03-07T04:00:49  <sigh> it is
2011-03-07T04:00:59  <antimatroid> then that makes no sense :s
2011-03-07T04:01:04  <sigh> paste code
2011-03-07T04:01:27  <sigh> preferably a minimal case that demonstrates the problem
2011-03-07T04:01:49  <antimatroid> bleh, have to reset internet
2011-03-07T04:02:34  <McLeopold> I didn't know he was in control of the whole internet...

2011-03-07T04:06:42  <antimatroid1> well this is annoying
2011-03-07T04:07:15  <antimatroid1> i can't replicate it sorting the way it does with the analyzer with a simple test case :\\
2011-03-07T04:08:27  <antimatroid1> got it
2011-03-07T04:09:45  <sigh> is it this: 0 < [0] < (0,)
2011-03-07T04:10:11  <antimatroid1> yeah i think
2011-03-07T04:10:56  <sigh> not sure how you've got lists and tuples mixed up in the same context, but good luck!

2011-03-07T04:13:51  <antimatroid1> i seriously need someone that knows python to write the "space" output part :P

2011-03-07T04:15:45  <antimatroid1> sigh: did i mention i've made my symmetric maps ensure now that no two players ever start in the same row or column? :P
2011-03-07T04:15:53  <antimatroid1> and i cant start everyone outside vision if necessary
2011-03-07T04:16:09  <antimatroid1> and i can do any number of players in a reasonable size
2011-03-07T04:16:10  <sigh> cool
2011-03-07T04:16:13  <antimatroid1> well, within reason
2011-03-07T04:16:34  <sigh> so the space output part, what needs to change?
2011-03-07T04:16:44  <antimatroid1> the code is awful?
2011-03-07T04:17:09  <antimatroid1> 131 is the line where i'm trying to sort my information
2011-03-07T04:17:25  <sigh> so it works?
2011-03-07T04:18:03  <antimatroid1> you can run that code with the given map and it should run fine
2011-03-07T04:18:09  <antimatroid1> it just wont sort properly
2011-03-07T04:18:15  <antimatroid1> "properly"*
2011-03-07T04:18:22  <antimatroid1> i'm sure whatever it's doing is considered proper
2011-03-07T04:18:42  <sigh> I'll play around with it
2011-03-07T04:19:07  <antimatroid1> :) cheers

2011-03-07T04:39:27  <antimatroid1> it would be cool if SOME of the maps required cooperating with your close enemy(s) in order to not just kill each other right away

2011-03-07T04:53:09  <sigh> :)
2011-03-07T04:54:57  <antimatroid1> while the equilibrium would be a draw, the actual better position would be on the row near the center

2011-03-07T12:19:11  <janzert> was about to say that it looks like you misunderstand and are printing the output
2011-03-07T12:19:19  <antimatroid1> i went to sleep early before, i'll add in ant counts in a minute then i think it's done
2011-03-07T12:19:42  <antimatroid1> janzert: i am printint it, what am i meant to be doing?
2011-03-07T12:19:52  <janzert> all you need to do is place it in an actual python dict and return it
2011-03-07T12:20:11  <antimatroid1> ah, okay, i have no idea what they are, i'll go look them up
2011-03-07T12:20:17  <antimatroid1> (i don't know python :P)
2011-03-07T12:20:18  <janzert> just sec I'll try and edit it on codepad
2011-03-07T12:20:41  <antimatroid1> have you got the link sigh gave me?
2011-03-07T12:20:44  <antimatroid1> i haven't edited that yet
2011-03-07T12:24:35  <janzert> something like this http://codepad.org/5ja5Smwt
2011-03-07T12:25:22  <janzert> also if your editor can do it all the tabs should be expanded into 4 spaces
2011-03-07T12:26:39  <janzert> also just noticed landAccessPlayers should have tuples for all the keys, just change line 126 to
2011-03-07T12:26:59  <janzert> landAccessPlayers[tuple(t[0])] += 1
2011-03-07T12:27:23  <janzert> or actually just get rid of the if/elif all together
2011-03-07T12:28:18  <antimatroid1> so t[0] isn't needed?
2011-03-07T12:28:23  <antimatroid1> cheers for that

2011-03-07T12:30:07  <janzert> the whole thing from 120 to 126 could be changed into a list comprehension
2011-03-07T12:30:13  <antimatroid1> what happened to my accessCounts :\
2011-03-07T12:30:30  <antimatroid1> is that all just in the landAccessPlayers?
2011-03-07T12:31:06  <McLeopold> also, python isn't java, don't use fake reverse Hungarian notatioin
2011-03-07T12:31:09  <janzert> yes, it looks like
2011-03-07T12:31:27  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: what do you mean?
2011-03-07T12:32:17  <McLeopold> Uppercasing all words except for the first one.  but I'm not totally serious
2011-03-07T12:32:46  <janzert> btw, I was wrong about changing to a list comprehension above
2011-03-07T12:33:38  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: it's in pep8, don't use mixed case for new development
2011-03-07T12:34:27  <antimatroid1> that's just what i tend to use for my own programs, do you want _'s?
2011-03-07T12:34:40  <antimatroid1> i don't mind changing that, i'm very indifferent about my variable naming convention
2011-03-07T12:34:47  <McLeopold> if you want to be a serious python programmer, then yes
2011-03-07T12:35:02  <antimatroid1> ^^ I don't, I hate python :P
2011-03-07T12:35:03  <McLeopold> I totally doesn't matter.
2011-03-07T12:35:18  <McLeopold> But read through pep8 and try an use good style.
2011-03-07T12:35:35  <McLeopold> I bet there's a script out there to fix it.
2011-03-07T12:35:54  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Python-Style-Guide
2011-03-07T12:35:56  <antimatroid1> i shall, i am slowly picking it up for the sake of my programs here not being as awful
2011-03-07T12:36:18  <janzert> which has links to pep8 and google python style guide
2011-03-07T12:36:42  <janzert> from what I can tell the google style guide is a superset of pep 8
2011-03-07T12:37:16  <McLeopold> the only thing that really gets me is the 80 character limit
2011-03-07T12:37:31  <McLeopold> I'm constantly going over a feel like I'm making my code less readable.
2011-03-07T12:38:29  <janzert> I go over around every few hundred lines
2011-03-07T12:39:02  <janzert> usually when I start going over I use it as an indicator that I need to factor out a separate function or break a single statement up
2011-03-07T12:39:22  <McLeopold> because your indent starts to far over?
2011-03-07T12:39:24  <janzert> or just use python's excellent line continuations to make it more readable :)
2011-03-07T12:39:37  <janzert> if that's what's causing it yes
2011-03-07T12:40:08  <McLeopold> how much time do I have left?
2011-03-07T12:40:47  <janzert> 7 hours?
2011-03-07T12:40:48  <janzert> :)
2011-03-07T12:41:10  <janzert> lunch time, be back in a while

2011-03-07T13:06:04  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: Oh, look at this http://codepad.org/PxNQKauD
2011-03-07T13:06:24  <antimatroid1> there is a square there that 12 people can reach in the same time
2011-03-07T13:06:48  <McLeopold> nice
2011-03-07T13:07:00  <antimatroid1> you can make that arbitrarily large
2011-03-07T13:07:01  <McLeopold> still it on git hub in manager
2011-03-07T13:08:22  <antimatroid1> the count stuff is sorted nicely in the end anyway :)
2011-03-07T13:08:32  <antimatroid1> it requires that if, elif part janzert said to get rid of
2011-03-07T13:08:37  <antimatroid1> otherwise you get a different ordering
2011-03-07T13:10:39  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: do you want me to make a manager directory inside the ants folder?
2011-03-07T13:10:58  <antimatroid1> or just map_analyzer.py in ants?
2011-03-07T13:12:02  <antimatroid1> oh, nevermind
2011-03-07T13:12:44  <janzert> antimatroid1: dictionaries are unordered
2011-03-07T13:13:30  <janzert> the reason I was saying to get rid of the if / elif is that McLeopold wanted all them as tuples of players
2011-03-07T13:13:43  <janzert> even if there is just one player
2011-03-07T13:13:48  <janzert> just for consistency
2011-03-07T13:14:55  <CIA-89> aichallenge: antimatroid epsilon * r22ae873 / manager/map_analyzer.py : added a map analyzer - http://bit.ly/eqrn8q
2011-03-07T13:15:07  <antimatroid1> janzert: ah crap, i just pushed it :P
2011-03-07T13:15:12  <janzert> that's ok
2011-03-07T13:15:20  <janzert> it can be changed later
2011-03-07T13:15:31  <antimatroid1> it needs to check if len(.) >= 1 still though
2011-03-07T13:15:42  <antimatroid1> otherwise you get the wall squares added in there which makes no sense
2011-03-07T13:15:50  <antimatroid1> water*

2011-03-07T15:19:45  <McLeopold> janzert: it appears submissions where stored on the server uncompressed, then compressed when the worker requested it
2011-03-07T15:20:25  <janzert> yes
2011-03-07T15:20:53  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-07T15:21:10  <janzert> with compilation all done on the workers though the main server should be able to just always hand out the original submission file
2011-03-07T15:22:31  <McLeopold> yep
2011-03-07T15:22:53  <McLeopold> but still test the unzip to get to status 20?
2011-03-07T15:22:57  <McLeopold> or not
2011-03-07T15:23:10  <janzert> I think skip that
2011-03-07T15:23:25  <janzert> it doesn't seem like it adds much value
2011-03-07T15:24:18  <janzert> the worker can always report back that it's invalid

2011-03-07T15:31:58  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan
2011-03-07T15:32:21  <McLeopold> actually, it looks like the get_submission zipped up the zip file
2011-03-07T15:38:01  <janzert> it sent everything that was in the submission's directory I believe? including the original submission file yes
2011-03-07T15:40:04  <amstan> what's going on?
2011-03-07T15:41:00  <McLeopold> I see, I'm not running compile_daemon, so it was never unzipped.
2011-03-07T15:43:44  <McLeopold> the compile daemon unzipped and cleaned stuff up, I'm thinking it should be an unzip daemon now.
2011-03-07T15:44:07  <McLeopold> Also, can the workers send emails?
2011-03-07T15:44:33  <janzert> yes, I'm hoping they can send the success/rejection emails
2011-03-07T15:45:15  <janzert> amazon just introduced an email sending service
2011-03-07T15:46:05  <McLeopold> janzert: after unpacking, the original zip was kept around
2011-03-07T15:46:12  <janzert> right
2011-03-07T15:46:41  <McLeopold> so, I'm thinking, the server will unzip, clean and make a separate tarball for the workers
2011-03-07T15:47:06  <janzert> ok. clean in what way?
2011-03-07T15:47:38  <janzert> I believe we have to keep all the files in case they are data files the bot depends on
2011-03-07T15:47:40  <McLeopold> whatever unpack does in the compile daemon
2011-03-07T15:48:00  <McLeopold> it did a clean because we included tools in the starter packs
2011-03-07T15:48:25  <janzert> ahh, yeah I do kind of remember that now
2011-03-07T15:48:32  <McLeopold> if we change that, we don't need to clean
2011-03-07T15:48:43  <McLeopold> but it would be nice if everything was a tgz
2011-03-07T15:49:08  <janzert> yeah, it does seem rather nice
2011-03-07T15:49:40  <janzert> but on the other hand if we don't nothing on main server ever needs to touch submissions directly
2011-03-07T15:50:02  <janzert> hmm, I guess I'm happy either way
2011-03-07T15:51:25  <McLeopold> I just need to make sure I send the right headers for the worker download.
2011-03-07T15:52:02  <McLeopold> tgz is tar.gz?
2011-03-07T15:52:06  <janzert> yes
2011-03-07T15:52:11  <McLeopold> ok

2011-03-07T16:03:43  <lavalamp> They are interspersed, unfortunately.
2011-03-07T16:03:53  <lavalamp> Should I just delete my fork and recreate it?

2011-03-07T16:05:17  <lavalamp> I discovered there was a problem when looking at the pull request interface... that and the fact that I wanted to add some documentation is why I haven't made a pull request yet...
2011-03-07T16:05:40  <amstan> yeah, np, it happens to all of us
2011-03-07T16:05:53  <lavalamp> ok I won't be able to do anything about this until tonight or tomorrow unfortunately
2011-03-07T16:06:22  <lavalamp> yeah I've never gone through a fork/pull request cycle on github before...
2011-03-07T16:07:50  <lavalamp> On the plus side the debugging .png images the go starter pack can now make are pretty cool :)

2011-03-07T16:08:24  <lavalamp> amstan: ok, will do, thanks
2011-03-07T16:08:58  <McLeopold> janzert: if we don't unpack, how should we calc the hash?
2011-03-07T16:09:28  <janzert> just use the hash of the submission file (on both sides of course)
2011-03-07T16:10:33  <janzert> it's just a double check that the worker actually ended up with the same thing the main server has
2011-03-07T16:13:46  <McLeopold> how would you hash the file in python?
2011-03-07T16:14:56  <amstan> McLeopold: how big? how often?
2011-03-07T16:15:20  <janzert> see submission_hash.py
2011-03-07T16:16:10  <janzert> specifically the function hash_file_sha takes a filename and returns the sha hash
2011-03-07T16:18:20  <janzert> although that also includes the filename in the hash which probably isn't needed or maybe even wanted for how you're using it
2011-03-07T16:19:47  <janzert> btw, if you decide to do any speed testing on this be sure to clear your filesystem caches prior to each test
2011-03-07T16:33:55  <McLeopold> janzert: can you  make the worker setup pull the submission_hash.py file from the manager dir?  That way we don't maintain 2 copies.  Or some github magic.
2011-03-07T16:34:52  <janzert> yeah, I was wondering what to do about that sort of thing in passing the other day
2011-03-07T16:37:14  <janzert> I think the cleanest thing would be to make a separate python package for all the common code to live in
2011-03-07T16:37:48  <janzert> but I'm not really enthused about that either

2011-03-07T17:56:25  <amstan> janzert: to split something like this: 2011-03-06T00:07:00  <janzert> McLeopold: the only constraint there that encourages it from what I see is the no repeat matches one
2011-03-07T17:56:36  <amstan> janzert: into date, nick and msg
2011-03-07T17:56:52  <McLeopold> in python?
2011-03-07T17:56:54  <amstan> ideally with some validation, but not too strict on the date, the date should just go until it hits a space char
2011-03-07T17:56:56  <janzert> I'd skip regex altogether
2011-03-07T17:57:00  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-03-07T17:57:18  <amstan> ideally something like this: http://pastebin.com/nJX5X5TT
2011-03-07T17:57:29  <amstan> that's how i'll use it
2011-03-07T17:57:33  <amstan> but mine doesn't work yet
2011-03-07T17:58:17  <McLeopold> str.split(' ', 2)
2011-03-07T17:58:44  <amstan> McLeopold: i need it not to match lines like: 2011-03-06T16:46:55  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has left #aichallenge

2011-03-07T17:59:01  <janzert> str.split should be plenty fast
2011-03-07T17:59:15  <amstan> ok..
2011-03-07T17:59:29  <janzert> I would be a bit surprised if it's slower than a regex
2011-03-07T17:59:56  <janzert> basically just need "date, name, msg = line.split(None, 2)"
2011-03-07T18:00:11  <janzert> then you'll need to strip the <>'s off the name
2011-03-07T18:00:22  <McLeopold> or reject it if it is *****
2011-03-07T18:02:28  <janzert> btw, use ' ' for the first argument to split if you really want to split on each space character
2011-03-07T18:03:14  <amstan> janzert: yeah.. got it..

2011-03-07T22:21:01  <Frontier> Why does it show the map analyzer as my commit? strange. i had some warning about some stuff that couldnt be pushed and something about fast-forward prior to that.
2011-03-07T22:24:39  <bss03> @later tell McLeopold If we want to balance a user's position on the map game_player needs a "seat" or "position" column.
2011-03-07T22:24:39  <contestbot> bss03: Yep.
2011-03-07T22:25:24  <bss03> @later tell McLeopold It also shows me who is the seed player; position = 0.
2011-03-07T22:25:24  <contestbot> bss03: I think that worked...
2011-03-07T22:25:34  <amstan> Frontier: because you commited
2011-03-07T22:25:39  <amstan> Frontier: merged*
2011-03-07T22:26:02  <amstan> Frontier: usually just ignore merge commits, unless you actually had branches going
2011-03-07T22:41:41  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-71-197-206-130.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-07T22:42:13  <McLeopold> bss03: give me a few minutes, and I'll send the newer schema
2011-03-07T22:44:37  <bss03> I've run out of time for working on it tonight.
2011-03-07T22:44:45  <bss03> I'll pick your schema up after work tomorrow.
2011-03-07T22:44:53  <janzert> heh, was about to ask if you were still around
2011-03-07T22:45:54  <McLeopold> okay, I won't rush it then
2011-03-07T22:46:09  <janzert> I know you need to know about positions on a map the player has previously played, but what do you need to know the seed for?
2011-03-07T22:46:49  <McLeopold> bss03: we can't have the player_id (aka position) also be the seed.  so I've added a seed field
2011-03-07T22:46:57  <bss03> Well, I'm just assuming seed player = position 0.
2011-03-07T22:47:06  <McLeopold> I thought that at first
2011-03-07T22:47:12  <bss03> That makes the most sense.
2011-03-07T22:47:14  <McLeopold> But I'd like to make it more flexible
2011-03-07T22:47:30  <janzert> what use is knowing which one was the seed player?
2011-03-07T22:47:34  <McLeopold> that way a picking a seed is disconnected from rotating it's position
2011-03-07T22:47:42  <bss03> Shrug.  The way I'm writing this, the only place to put the seed is position 0.
2011-03-07T22:48:02  <bss03> Well, not the only place, but...
2011-03-07T22:48:44  <McLeopold> sigh: are you around?
2011-03-07T22:48:59  <bss03> When the other players are picked, players that haven't played in the position currently being chosen are preferred.
2011-03-07T22:49:33  <bss03> That naturally rotates all seats except 0.  Which is the seed, and why we should rotate the seed some.
2011-03-07T22:50:02  <bss03> In writing some SQL I found that issue and posted it to the wiki.
2011-03-07T22:50:20  <bss03> "rotate the seed" (between different players), not re-seat the seed.
2011-03-07T22:51:37  <janzert> so long as there are more players then can play in one game I think we're ok
2011-03-07T22:51:45  <bss03> But, I'm fine with game having a seed_user_id column.  Might reduce some queries a little bit, and does allow us to rotate players if it makes sense.
2011-03-07T22:52:57  * bss03 argees with janzert.
2011-03-07T22:53:30  <bss03> I just hate breaking ties based on user_id when there does seem to be a better way to do it.
2011-03-07T22:53:45  <sigh> McLeopold: yes

2011-03-07T22:54:53  <lavalamp> hi everyone
2011-03-07T22:55:02  <lavalamp> I think I found a bug in playgame.py
2011-03-07T22:55:18  <lavalamp> or I guess it's engine.py
2011-03-07T22:56:02  <McLeopold> sigh: would you be willing to do work on the engine?
2011-03-07T22:56:10  <bss03> I suppose after we choose the map, we can "move" the seed player to a seat they haven't played from before.  Seems easy enough.
2011-03-07T22:56:17  *** chris__0076 <chris__0076!~Chris_007@adsl-190-51-155.asm.bellsouth.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-07T22:56:33  <bss03> Anyway.  Time for bed.  Night all.
2011-03-07T22:56:43  <McLeopold> night
2011-03-07T22:56:45  <sigh> McLeopold: well not right now, I'm at work :)
2011-03-07T22:56:56  <McLeopold> I mean in general :)
2011-03-07T22:57:08  <McLeopold> I need someone to write a fair food spawning algo
2011-03-07T22:57:22  <McLeopold> lavalamp: what's the bug?
2011-03-07T22:57:29  <lavalamp> or maybe I misunderstand the spec...
2011-03-07T22:57:33  <lavalamp> "If more than one ant is in a square once all moves have been made, each of these ants automatically dies. No points are assigned for these deaths and you wont see information about these dead ants."
2011-03-07T22:58:01  <McLeopold> lavalamp: you might be right
2011-03-07T22:58:06  <lavalamp> I take that to mean that if I move ant A onto square B and then move ant C onto A's original square, it should be fine?
2011-03-07T22:58:18  <janzert> I thought it was decided to spawn points for those if an enemy was also in range?
2011-03-07T22:58:29  <janzert> err, assign points
2011-03-07T22:58:36  <sigh> McLeopold: ah I see... are there any clear requirements/specs yet?
2011-03-07T22:58:37  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, it has been
2011-03-07T22:58:43  <sigh> or is working them out part of it too?
2011-03-07T22:58:46  <McLeopold> sigh: not for food spawning
2011-03-07T22:59:03  <lavalamp> But it seems right now that it kills the ants
2011-03-07T22:59:20  <sigh> I'm probably not the best person to ask then, because I haven't been following the game very closely
2011-03-07T22:59:24  <McLeopold> sigh: my only thought was to pick an offset, then spawn 1 food per bot offset from their starting location
2011-03-07T23:00:08  <McLeopold> lavalamp: ant's stepping on each other should kill each other
2011-03-07T23:00:27  <McLeopold> I'm maintaining a list of ant that died in each square.
2011-03-07T23:00:57  <McLeopold> Ants that do step on each other are taken out before regular battle, so the code is in a different area
2011-03-07T23:01:01  <lavalamp> Imagine a 1 pixel wide corridor completely full of ants. Can I advance them all one space forward on the same turn?
2011-03-07T23:01:08  <janzert> but if ant 1 moves off of square A ant 2 should be able to move on it in the same turn though right?
2011-03-07T23:01:14  <lavalamp> The spec implies I should be able to.
2011-03-07T23:01:20  <McLeopold> janzert: yes
2011-03-07T23:01:44  <lavalamp> Ok. Then I'm pretty sure there's a bug in the engine.
2011-03-07T23:02:48  <janzert> McLeopold: updating the spec, is death information given for ants dying by collision now?
2011-03-07T23:03:14  <McLeopold> all ant that die for any reason should be output in the square they die at
2011-03-07T23:03:25  <janzert> good :)
2011-03-07T23:03:50  <lavalamp> actually now I'm confused at this output, hold that thought.
2011-03-07T23:04:13  <sigh> McLeopold: sorry I'll have to pass, I'm really not familiar enough with the existing specifications to feel like I can do a good job with it
2011-03-07T23:04:44  <McLeopold> if you have time, give it an hour, then let me know
2011-03-07T23:04:53  <lavalamp> OK I think I am just confused about the row/col <-> X/Y translation
2011-03-07T23:05:31  <McLeopold> yeah, that should be ironed out in the engine
2011-03-07T23:05:31  <sigh> McLeopold: ok, let me know what part of the code I should be looking at and I'll take a look tonight
2011-03-07T23:07:05  <McLeopold> sigh: aichallenge/ants/ants.py do_food_random, antimatroid can help with ideas
2011-03-07T23:07:06  <antimatroid> sigh: i know how you can do fair spawning sort of
2011-03-07T23:07:28  <antimatroid> lavalamp: you should be able to move into a square an ant is moving out of
2011-03-07T23:08:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think we should agree to use my method of placing starting ants at least
2011-03-07T23:08:23  <lavalamp> antimatroid: false alarm! I had row/col swapped and it caused my collision detection code to fail
2011-03-07T23:08:24  <antimatroid> actually, you guys might not like that?
2011-03-07T23:08:40  <antimatroid> lavalamp: don't ever use x,y
2011-03-07T23:08:47  <antimatroid> it'll only confuse the hell out of you
2011-03-07T23:08:56  <lavalamp> clearly
2011-03-07T23:09:03  <amstan> i did that in tron, lol
2011-03-07T23:09:03  <lavalamp> maybe I should switch everything over
2011-03-07T23:09:20  <antimatroid> if we used x,y you'd have to translate stuff, when printing/reading maps, now EVERYTHING is the same, it's the better option
2011-03-07T23:09:25  <lavalamp> it's just so unnatural to represent a grid with the vertical element first :/
2011-03-07T23:09:31  <antimatroid> no it's not
2011-03-07T23:09:42  <antimatroid> ever written on a page?
2011-03-07T23:09:44  <lavalamp> haha to me it is, I should say
2011-03-07T23:09:47  <antimatroid> you index the row then write along it
2011-03-07T23:09:50  <antimatroid> ever used a matrix?
2011-03-07T23:10:06  <lavalamp> alright, good point
2011-03-07T23:10:17  <lavalamp> most of my "grid" work is images
2011-03-07T23:10:40  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm surprised people don't strictly use row,col for indexing things, it ensures everything is consistent
2011-03-07T23:10:48  <lavalamp> I'll switch things around so I don't confuse anyone else
2011-03-07T23:10:51  * janzert agrees, math nerds might be comfortable with vertical first but most of CS has done horizontal first for a very long time :P
2011-03-07T23:10:52  <antimatroid> :)
2011-03-07T23:11:31  <antimatroid> janzert: and i think they've been wrong in doing so, i'd be alright with it being a different standard, but due to having to translate stuff when inputting and outputting i think it's inferior
2011-03-07T23:13:12  <antimatroid> well, i'll happily take all complaints throughout the tournament for row,col indexing :)
2011-03-07T23:13:56  <lavalamp> hehe
2011-03-07T23:14:38  <antimatroid> i am terrible
2011-03-07T23:14:53  <antimatroid> i keep saying translate instead of transpose and transpose instead of translate
2011-03-07T23:19:26  * antimatroid wonders if we could find someone to make a 3d visualiser on a torus
2011-03-07T23:20:06  <antimatroid> and you could change not only the angle you are looking at the tours, but also translate either lot of rings on the torus
2011-03-07T23:25:10  <antimatroid> do people still prefer asymmetric maps to symmetric?
2011-03-07T23:25:38  <McLeopold> you will need to analyze them at least :)
2011-03-07T23:25:49  <antimatroid> i'm thinking about food spawning
2011-03-07T23:26:13  <antimatroid> i like the way i'm currently placing ants at least, even for asymmetric maps
2011-03-07T23:27:22  <antimatroid> and you can take rtranslate, ctranslate in the engine to be the difference between any two players starting positions for placing food symmetrically if you ensure no two players start in the same row or column, which i'm currently doing
2011-03-07T23:36:08  <antimatroid> hehe, i get to map an "antisymmetric" map gen, which works for multiple reasons
2011-03-07T23:36:23  <antimatroid> ant y

2011-03-07T23:52:39  <lavalamp> you wouldn't think it'd be so hard to swap names and order :/
2011-03-07T23:52:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-spawning
2011-03-07T23:54:21  <antimatroid> lavalamp: worst would have been translating your n,e,s,w move output :P
2011-03-07T23:54:29  <McLeopold> also, I totally don't understand your "no ant in the same row" stuff.  Do you have pictures?
2011-03-07T23:54:37  <antimatroid> transposing god damnit!
2011-03-07T23:54:44  <antimatroid> hang on
2011-03-07T23:55:01  <McLeopold> antimatroid: let's do a klein bottle and really screw everyone up
2011-03-07T23:55:23  <lavalamp> antimatroid: lol and yeah that was almost as bad as finding the place where I really had reversed row/col previously to get the map the right size.... XP
2011-03-07T23:56:28  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/Z3GqjRTN
2011-03-07T23:56:45  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'd be down, but it'd make distance and getlocation harder
2011-03-07T23:57:04  <McLeopold> so, what's the benefit of the "not same row/col"?
2011-03-07T23:57:19  <antimatroid> symmetric maps don't look so latticy
2011-03-07T23:57:30  <McLeopold> so,  just astetics?
2011-03-07T23:57:34  <antimatroid> and you don't have any idea where the other players started
2011-03-07T23:57:39  <McLeopold> ascetics
2011-03-07T23:57:45  <antimatroid> aesthetics*
2011-03-07T23:57:55  <McLeopold> yeah, spell check was failing me :)
2011-03-07T23:58:07  <antimatroid> i don't have spellcheck for irc :(
2011-03-07T23:58:39  <lavalamp> amstan: I'll have to sort out the damage I did to my github fork later. But the go starter package should be all done now.
2011-03-07T23:58:42  <antimatroid> i think it's good that you don't know where your enemies started
2011-03-07T23:58:54  <McLeopold> yes, that is good
2011-03-07T23:59:08  <McLeopold> I always thought it was going to be more of an issue of pathfinding
2011-03-07T23:59:16  <amstan> lavalamp: ugh.. ok.. let me figure it out..
2011-03-07T23:59:22  <antimatroid> and if you want to place food symmetrically, it then doesn't matter which two players starting locations your work out rtranslate and ctranslate from
2011-03-07T23:59:23  <amstan> lavalamp: link me all commits that you want to keep
2011-03-07T23:59:40  <lavalamp> ok hold on
