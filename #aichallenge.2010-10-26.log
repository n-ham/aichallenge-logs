2010-10-26T00:04:05  <Mathnerd314> (they'd do it for the Loebner prize instead)
2010-10-26T00:04:18  <amstan> loebner is kinda useless
2010-10-26T00:04:37  <amstan> the bot could just output random garbage.. because hey, there are humans that would do that
2010-10-26T00:08:22  <Mathnerd314> not really... your goal is to *prove* you're human
2010-10-26T00:09:31  <amstan> but prooving your a human is not that useful when most humans are trolls and don't obey instructions

2010-10-26T00:13:12  <Appleman1234> Mathnerd314, I started before you mentioned it
2010-10-26T00:13:16  <Mathnerd314> amstan: productive. writes code or something.
2010-10-26T00:13:45  <amstan> Mathnerd314: but see, a turing test won't help you in those regards
2010-10-26T00:14:29  <Mathnerd314> amstan: yes it will. add conditions that the computer/person must be proficient in coding.
2010-10-26T00:15:00  <amstan> Mathnerd314: but they don't have to respect any of the interviewer's wishes, that's the point
2010-10-26T00:15:10  <amstan> even if they know to code anything, they can just refuse
2010-10-26T00:15:22  <amstan> or even lie about their coding proficiency

2010-10-26T00:19:07  <amstan> i disagree

2010-10-26T00:28:59  <amstan> eburnette: assemble a list of source planets, caculate the time it takes to get to the target
2010-10-26T00:29:12  <amstan> launch your farthest fleet
2010-10-26T00:29:45  <amstan> let's say it arrives at target at time TT
2010-10-26T00:30:08  <amstan> you have to launch your other fleets at time TT-Di, where Di is time to reach the target

2010-10-26T00:31:46  <amstan> Mathnerd314: that's beyond the scope of the question
2010-10-26T00:31:56  <bhasker> he launches partial fleets calculating that he will take neutral at time T  and that it will have X ships that he can add to the attack
2010-10-26T00:32:13  <bhasker> watch his start on close matches
2010-10-26T00:32:17  <bhasker> its pretty interesting
2010-10-26T00:32:35  <eburnette> Guess I need to keep state between moves, not currently doing that
2010-10-26T00:32:39  <bhasker> he is taking into account what neutrals will have how many ships in the future and just launching that those ships will be available
2010-10-26T00:33:49  <eburnette> I've seen him launch ships at a planet he owned, then those took the place of a launch one move ahead when they got there (kind of a time warp)
2010-10-26T00:36:23  <eburnette> He claims it's just a 2-ply minimax with a good eval function but I'm skeptical that's really it because he's doing it in lisp and there are tens of thousands of possible moves per ply
2010-10-26T00:36:43  <a1k0n> sbcl is pretty fast.  compiles to native code; pretty efficient code with type hints
2010-10-26T00:36:49  <a1k0n> but yeah, the move generator is something special
2010-10-26T00:37:18  <a1k0n> my goal was 1 ply minimax with a good eval function with a pretty exhaustive move generator but maybe that's not so good
2010-10-26T00:37:41  <a1k0n> cuz i'm having a hard time defeating the tactic where you pick off a neutral right after your opponent takes it
2010-10-26T00:38:48  <eburnette> you could have a simple 2nd ply that does that sniping
2010-10-26T00:39:11  <eburnette> I found ragebot mades a pretty good 2nd ply :)
2010-10-26T00:41:18  <eburnette> It's hard not to be overly cautious yet still protect against rage attacks

2010-10-26T03:03:36  <mega1> are all maps generated by the same algorithm but with different seeds?

2010-10-26T04:25:25  <mega1> that he doesn't move for several turns after the start?
2010-10-26T04:25:32  <mega1> and still wins.

2010-10-26T08:31:01  <Error323> Dear developers, it seems that currently bots that have just been submitted are also doing battle against eachother. This results in slower convergence of their true rankings. Imho newly submitted bots should only play against bots that have a stable ranking.

2010-10-26T09:00:27  <mega1> this morning I was surprised to see b0.31 lose to b0.30 on tcp by 10-28-29 (win-draw-loss). The same result over all 1000 maps is 752-733-512.
2010-10-26T09:01:17  <mega1> now I only need to calculate the likelihood of seeing a results as extreme as on the tcp server to gauge whether something's wrong with map selection
2010-10-26T09:06:16  <bhasker> mega1 your bot is awesome btw
2010-10-26T09:06:41  <bhasker> the first bot that i have seen that does some very funky stuff
2010-10-26T09:07:23  <mega1> stop it now or I'll be too ashamed to publish to source code come the end of contest
2010-10-26T09:07:27  <bhasker> haha
2010-10-26T09:07:37  <bhasker> i like how it calculates into the future when capturing neutrals

2010-10-26T09:12:50  <bhasker> with 4 ships on turn 1
2010-10-26T09:12:55  <mega1> on the next turn only
2010-10-26T09:13:01  <bhasker> hmm let me check again
2010-10-26T09:13:15  <bhasker> oh yea 1 turn behind
2010-10-26T09:13:18  <bhasker> but why send 4 ships?
2010-10-26T09:13:49  <bhasker> it was no way enough to take the planet unless you include the ships it got from the newly acquired neutrals

2010-10-26T09:14:18  <bhasker> yes but your 4 are not enough to take it?
2010-10-26T09:14:26  <bhasker> you are more than 1 turn away
2010-10-26T09:14:42  <bhasker> in the end you needed 4+4+2 ships to take it
2010-10-26T09:14:54  <mega1> what you see is a multiplanet attack
2010-10-26T09:15:18  <bhasker> so the initial 4 launch was either wrong or it factored the new neutrals it will have at that turn into account
2010-10-26T09:15:24  <mega1> it looks better because when the first fleet is launch the other two planets are not yet taken
2010-10-26T09:15:29  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-26T09:15:36  <mega1> *launched
2010-10-26T09:15:45  <bhasker> i do multi planet launch but mine doesn't take the neutrals not yet acquired into account
2010-10-26T09:15:58  <bhasker> need to figure out a good way to do that ^
2010-10-26T09:16:18  <bhasker> though my bot did manage to beat yours twice yesterday ^
2010-10-26T09:16:38  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=701233 :d
2010-10-26T09:16:43  <bhasker> i should go celebrate
2010-10-26T09:19:07  <bhasker> the way my code is structured it would be hard to do what your bot is doing, factoring in neutrals before acquisition

2010-10-26T13:11:50  <bhasker> morning
2010-10-26T13:11:56  <bhasker> i just rolled back a full morning of fixes
2010-10-26T13:11:58  <contestbot> Top 10 players: Simplex(3714), rsergio(3701), dmj111(3631), GreenTea(3551), felixcoto(3532), Hazard(3523), protocolocon(3485), jambachili(3481), george(3462), sin_sun(3454)
2010-10-26T13:12:01  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-26T13:12:11  <bhasker> strangely these bots at the top play very differently
2010-10-26T13:12:21  <bhasker> they don't seem to accumulate ships to take over neutrals
2010-10-26T13:12:26  <bhasker> they seem to stream ships at neutrals
2010-10-26T13:13:13  <raedwulf> yea, not sure if thats advantagous or now
2010-10-26T13:13:15  <raedwulf> not*
2010-10-26T13:13:46  <JamesMG> it would seem that would lead to sniping, but I guess if you do the math and outproduce the opponent, or tie with them

2010-10-26T13:26:26  <bhasker> i guess you save one turn don't know
2010-10-26T13:28:20  <lavalamp_> I think streaming saves you from committing all your forces
2010-10-26T13:29:28  <bhasker> hmm not really
2010-10-26T13:29:33  <bhasker> since if the planet is far enough
2010-10-26T13:29:43  <bhasker> you are practically committing the same number?
2010-10-26T13:29:52  <bhasker> i guess one could use that as a heuristic
2010-10-26T13:29:56  <bhasker> for closer planets stream?
2010-10-26T13:30:05  <lavalamp_> maybe
2010-10-26T13:30:06  <bhasker> and further away just commit the whole thing not sure
2010-10-26T13:30:46  <lavalamp_> maybe it has to do with how close the enemy is to your sending planet...

2010-10-26T13:52:55  <lavalamp_> I wonder if it's just implementation details that separate the top few bots from the rest of if they have thought of additional strategies
2010-10-26T13:53:02  <lavalamp_> *or if
2010-10-26T13:54:41  <lavalamp_> bhasker, what'd you do between malazan 10 and 11, if you don't mind my asking?
2010-10-26T13:57:47  <bhasker> nothing
2010-10-26T13:57:55  <bhasker> i was tinkering with 10
2010-10-26T13:57:58  <bhasker> and it got worse
2010-10-26T13:58:00  <bhasker> so i rolled back
2010-10-26T13:58:04  <bhasker> and started up as 11
2010-10-26T13:58:17  <bhasker> since 10's elo got completly screwed with the tinkering

2010-10-26T14:05:17  <bhasker> don't have an automated system to figure out the mistake
2010-10-26T14:05:21  <bhasker> maybe i should write one ^
2010-10-26T14:05:34  <bhasker> most of my bugs are of the two kinds
2010-10-26T14:05:40  <bhasker> a) on some maps i just pick wrong starting planets
2010-10-26T14:05:47  <bhasker> b) acquire the wrong neutral midgame
2010-10-26T14:06:09  <lavalamp_> I was thinking of logging something whenever my evaluation suddenly changes
2010-10-26T14:06:23  <lavalamp_> yeah I have both those problems also
2010-10-26T14:06:25  <bhasker> well mine is not a mini max or anything its a heuristic bot
2010-10-26T14:06:38  <bhasker> so sometimes the heuristics just fail
2010-10-26T14:06:46  <bhasker> so not easy to identify the fault
2010-10-26T14:06:53  <lavalamp_> hm good point
2010-10-26T14:06:56  <bhasker> have to look at the logs and then look at my code back and forth
2010-10-26T14:07:02  <bhasker> to figure out the bug
2010-10-26T14:07:20  <bhasker> i am debating writing a minimax version
2010-10-26T14:07:31  <bhasker> but its so much work and i don't have much experience writing minimax solutions ^
2010-10-26T14:07:46  <lavalamp_> ...and I'm not so sure it's working out, hehe

2010-10-26T14:08:58  <JamesMG> yours seems to be getting there, lavalamp_
2010-10-26T14:09:17  <lavalamp_> Thanks ^^
2010-10-26T14:09:18  <bhasker> and mostly if i do write a minimax bot i might have to write it in c++ or something
2010-10-26T14:09:21  <bhasker> which i am not very keen on
2010-10-26T14:09:29  <lavalamp_> what is your current one in?
2010-10-26T14:09:32  <bhasker> python
2010-10-26T14:09:40  <bhasker> mostly for the speed boost
2010-10-26T14:09:43  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-10-26T14:09:44  <bhasker> i would need to do it in c++
2010-10-26T14:09:49  <lavalamp_> is python that slow?
2010-10-26T14:10:07  <bhasker> will probably be given that minimax will require massive computation
2010-10-26T14:10:10  <bhasker> it will add up
2010-10-26T14:10:15  <bhasker> when you are simulating nodes

2010-10-26T14:11:23  <JamesMG> I got mine down quite a bit this morning
2010-10-26T14:11:47  <Zannick> map 701
2010-10-26T14:11:49  <lavalamp_> a1k0n, that's not the only draw map I've seen lately
2010-10-26T14:11:49  <bhasker> yea thats a buggy map
2010-10-26T14:11:55  <bhasker> there are a couple more
2010-10-26T14:11:58  <contestbot> Top 10 players: rsergio(3729), Simplex(3666), dmj111(3616), GreenTea(3561), felixcoto(3530), Hazard(3511), protocolocon(3492), george(3465), jambachili(3458), sin_sun(3443)
2010-10-26T14:12:07  <bhasker> one with a 2 planets of 1 growth with 5 ships on them
2010-10-26T14:12:09  <bhasker> to the sides
2010-10-26T14:12:10  <Zannick> yeah, those must have been made before the map generator bugfix
2010-10-26T14:12:14  <bhasker> usually draws too
2010-10-26T14:13:40  <lavalamp_> bug fixes brought me from -550 to +50 but I'm not sure how much further I can get that way...

2010-10-26T14:15:24  <antimatroid1> was going great until Accoun
2010-10-26T14:15:27  <bhasker> yea been trying to fix it
2010-10-26T14:15:31  <bhasker> need to watch games
2010-10-26T14:15:38  <bhasker> my bot is doing reasonably well against accoun*
2010-10-26T14:15:47  <bhasker> but it fails against ObligatoryShamoo :(((
2010-10-26T14:15:48  <antimatroid1> he got my 2/3 just before
2010-10-26T14:15:50  <bhasker> very annoying
2010-10-26T14:15:53  <antimatroid1> but i made some pretty stupid moves
2010-10-26T14:15:56  <lavalamp_> accoun needs to fix close maps
2010-10-26T14:16:08  <antimatroid1> yeah, obligatory shampoo gives me a lot of pain too
2010-10-26T14:16:11  <antimatroid1> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=retard
2010-10-26T14:16:12  <lavalamp_> o.shampoo kills me too
2010-10-26T14:16:24  <bhasker> except his elo rating is like 150 points below my bots
2010-10-26T14:16:27  <bhasker> and i keep losing to it
2010-10-26T14:16:29  <antimatroid1> same
2010-10-26T14:16:29  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-26T14:16:36  <antimatroid1> it's annoying as fuck aha
2010-10-26T14:16:42  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-26T14:16:44  <lavalamp_> yeah I don't understand who he loses to that he stays at that rating
2010-10-26T14:17:04  <antimatroid1> i think he might have one of those bots that isn't very good generally
2010-10-26T14:17:08  <antimatroid1> just sometimes?
2010-10-26T14:17:20  <antimatroid1> hence the elo screws up, but bothers better bots on some maps
2010-10-26T14:17:49  <antimatroid1> i guess that's a flaw with elo, you're assuming the bots are of equal "goodness" on each map
2010-10-26T14:18:36  <antimatroid1> alrigth lavalamp, lets do this
2010-10-26T14:18:56  <lavalamp_> haha did we get matched?
2010-10-26T14:19:12  <antimatroid1> yeah, i have it running as retard atm
2010-10-26T14:19:21  <antimatroid1> it was a lot more retarded yesterday, i'm ironing out bugs
2010-10-26T14:19:23  <lavalamp_> I think you'll probably win

2010-10-26T14:21:58  <antimatroid1> i've taken minimax out for the moment, it's too complicated to consider sending my "future" ships and have the opponent moving against me
2010-10-26T14:22:16  <antimatroid1> it's just doing defense moves then a tree of individual offense and expansionary moves

2010-10-26T14:42:27  <AJC> it also depends on how well a bot can predict the other
2010-10-26T14:42:41  <antimatroid1> i got a game against dmj the muggle
2010-10-26T14:43:02  <bhasker> hah nice
2010-10-26T14:43:03  <lavalamp_> bhasker, there's some debate as to whether there are rock-paper-scissor situations or if it's a draw
2010-10-26T14:43:29  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-26T14:43:36  <antimatroid1> has no one cooked up an example yet
2010-10-26T14:43:42  <antimatroid1> shesh, give me 10 minutes
2010-10-26T14:43:50  <Zannick> some people have, yes.
2010-10-26T14:43:56  <Zannick> there isn't a canonical one, though
2010-10-26T14:44:07  <antimatroid1> canonical as in symmetric?
2010-10-26T14:44:16  <Zannick> canonical as in one everybody knows
2010-10-26T14:44:27  <Zannick> the examples i've seen are symmetric
2010-10-26T14:44:34  <lavalamp_> my bot is set up to detect such situations and play mixed strategies in them, but it's not good enough for that to be meaningful yet
2010-10-26T14:47:00  <antimatroid1> okay, i can do it, give me more than 10 minutes though and i'll work the details out properly
2010-10-26T14:47:08  <raedwulf> AJC: it will be a draw, because they would make identical moves (if you try a bot that has a deterministic playing style with itself, it will be a draw)
2010-10-26T14:47:31  <AJC> raedwulf, but if I can predict your move I will move differently.
2010-10-26T14:47:46  <raedwulf> yes, but both moves occur at the same time in a turn
2010-10-26T14:47:56  <raedwulf> its not one person moves before the other
2010-10-26T14:47:59  <raedwulf> its we have a world
2010-10-26T14:48:00  <AJC> due to the fact you can't exaustively search the space, what you predict affects the behavior.
2010-10-26T14:48:29  <raedwulf> well its whether the two bots have the same idea of "good"
2010-10-26T14:48:45  <raedwulf> if the bots are identical, it will come to a draw because it will end up being deterministic
2010-10-26T14:49:04  <AJC> OK, I agree on that.
2010-10-26T14:49:13  <raedwulf> if there's two different bots with different ideas of "good" but search exhaustively, it may not be a draw

2010-10-26T14:50:14  <raedwulf> ok my last line doesn't quite work but heh
2010-10-26T14:51:11  <bhasker> heh this looks my best iteration on the bot, its been holding 400+ elo rating for over 80 games
2010-10-26T14:51:16  <bhasker> normally it drops to low 300's
2010-10-26T14:51:22  <bhasker> after 20-30 games
2010-10-26T14:51:23  <raedwulf> actually if you knew the entire search space... there is no way you could not draw
2010-10-26T14:51:27  <lavalamp_> bhasker, nice
2010-10-26T14:51:42  <bhasker> 73 games played
2010-10-26T14:51:48  <lavalamp_> raedwulf, it depends if there are rps situations
2010-10-26T14:51:59  <raedwulf> lavalamp_: rps?
2010-10-26T14:52:08  <lavalamp_> rock paper scissors
2010-10-26T14:52:29  <lavalamp_> as in, defend beats attack beats expand beats defend
2010-10-26T14:52:40  <raedwulf> not if you knew the entire search space
2010-10-26T14:52:42  <raedwulf> thats his premise
2010-10-26T14:52:54  <bhasker> i think its inflated till i play ObligatoryShampoo then i will drop lol
2010-10-26T14:52:57  <raedwulf> search exhaustively = being able to see the entire search space
2010-10-26T14:53:00  <lavalamp_> even if you know the entire space there could still be such situations
2010-10-26T14:53:38  <a1k0n> in other words, the best thing for you to do depends on what your opponent does on the same turn
2010-10-26T14:53:43  <raedwulf> no, i don't believe so, because the bot would be able to know which would lead to its own loss
2010-10-26T14:54:02  <a1k0n> if you took alternate turns with your opponent and could see his moves you would be right
2010-10-26T14:54:12  <lavalamp_> raedwulf, the fact that you move at the same time changes things, this is not chess
2010-10-26T14:54:27  <raedwulf> hmmmm
2010-10-26T14:54:30  * raedwulf thinks some more
2010-10-26T14:54:54  <raedwulf> i suppose that would be the case
2010-10-26T14:54:55  <a1k0n> but as lavalamp said it's debatable whether such a mutually exclusive situation exists
2010-10-26T14:55:04  <lavalamp_> right, we don't know either way
2010-10-26T14:55:27  <raedwulf> ok, i agree
2010-10-26T14:55:45  <bhasker> so... is a draw possible?
2010-10-26T14:55:57  <raedwulf> if the bots play deterministically the same way :P
2010-10-26T14:56:06  <raedwulf> a draw is possible yes
2010-10-26T14:56:14  <raedwulf> we are wondering if its "always" a draw
2010-10-26T14:57:04  <lavalamp_> since no one has found an rps situation, I'm guessing they're rare if they exist-- so I'll go out on a limb and say that most maps should probably be draws
2010-10-26T14:57:16  <antimatroid1> i think this does it
2010-10-26T14:57:23  <antimatroid1> http://imgur.com/p2XGG.png
2010-10-26T14:57:29  <antimatroid1> i kept it in 1d to make things easier
2010-10-26T14:57:42  <a1k0n> that's good, i can exhaustively search that
2010-10-26T14:57:57  <antimatroid1> you either wait, expand, or attack their neutral
2010-10-26T14:58:43  <antimatroid1> if you both do the same you draw,
2010-10-26T14:58:44  <antimatroid1> if you expand and they attack you lose,
2010-10-26T14:58:44  <antimatroid1> if you expand and they wait, you win
2010-10-26T14:58:44  <antimatroid1> if you attack and they wait you lose
2010-10-26T14:58:47  <antimatroid1> and vice versa for each
2010-10-26T14:59:21  <lavalamp_> what do you mean by attackL
2010-10-26T14:59:25  <lavalamp_> attack?
2010-10-26T14:59:36  <antimatroid1> attack the neutral closest to the enemy that turn
2010-10-26T14:59:43  <lavalamp_> ah
2010-10-26T14:59:49  <antimatroid1> so don't consider attacking the enemies planet, assume they wont send that much
2010-10-26T14:59:59  <a1k0n> it almost goes without saying you should send 6 ships to the enemy neutral on turn 1
2010-10-26T15:00:07  <antimatroid1> but if they wait you lose
2010-10-26T15:00:36  <a1k0n> well
2010-10-26T15:00:44  <a1k0n> how about sending 100 ships to your neutral right away?
2010-10-26T15:00:58  <antimatroid1> if they send all their ships at that planet you lose
2010-10-26T15:01:42  <antimatroid1> d=1 isn't allowed, but numbers can be changed to represent the same situation
2010-10-26T15:02:25  <antimatroid1> am i right that there is no "best" strategy there other than to randomise?
2010-10-26T15:02:39  <lavalamp_> still thinking
2010-10-26T15:03:16  <antimatroid1> i think in reality you'd want to go for your neutral, as most bots aren't going to be trying to snipe you that move
2010-10-26T15:04:16  <JamesMG> what if you move all 100, and then 5 for each turn after that, to your neutral?
2010-10-26T15:04:23  <JamesMG> I'm still running the math but...
2010-10-26T15:04:33  <lavalamp_> antimatroid1 I think you have a winner
2010-10-26T15:04:33  <antimatroid1> you lose
2010-10-26T15:04:43  <antimatroid1> if they send all their ships and future ships at that neutral
2010-10-26T15:04:50  <antimatroid1> but only if they do it the first turn
2010-10-26T15:04:53  <antimatroid1> if they wait, you win
2010-10-26T15:04:54  <a1k0n> yeah you end up behind by 4
2010-10-26T15:05:06  <bhasker> interesting
2010-10-26T15:05:14  <JamesMG> oh I saw that as d=2, my bad
2010-10-26T15:05:18  <JamesMG> yeah, ok
2010-10-26T15:05:23  <bhasker> so best solution would be for the bot to do nothing and draw the game ?
2010-10-26T15:05:24  <antimatroid1> it's exactly isomorphic to rock paper scissors
2010-10-26T15:05:30  <lavalamp_> sweet, in this map my bot *should* detect this and randomly chose one
2010-10-26T15:05:36  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-26T15:05:38  <antimatroid1> bhasker: if they expand you lose
2010-10-26T15:05:46  <antimatroid1> it's exactly rock paper scissors
2010-10-26T15:05:58  <lavalamp_> thanks for finding this!
2010-10-26T15:06:19  <antimatroid1> it gets more complicated once you take it to 2d and players planets get closer
2010-10-26T15:06:21  <antimatroid1> way more complicated
2010-10-26T15:06:37  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-26T15:07:03  <antimatroid1> i hadn't done that, i should go and solve the game in 1d
2010-10-26T15:07:06  <antimatroid1> then work on 2d
2010-10-26T15:07:10  <antimatroid1> 2d makes my brain want to die
2010-10-26T15:07:11  <a1k0n> so i wonder what the conditions are for a mutually exclusive strategy to exist... if the neutrals have 5 ships then it's a draw right?
2010-10-26T15:07:29  <antimatroid1> i think 5 is the same situation yeah?
2010-10-26T15:07:30  <lavalamp_> hmmmm what if you send 33 ships at each planet??
2010-10-26T15:07:36  <antimatroid1> 5-9 should be the same situation
2010-10-26T15:08:11  <antimatroid1> if it's 4 and you expand and they wait you lose, so you'd always wait
2010-10-26T15:08:11  <a1k0n> well you'd gain back 5 ships before they could reach your neutral
2010-10-26T15:08:21  <JamesMG> should 5-100 be the same, in that moving there guarantees the enemy gets the planet if he also goes there?
2010-10-26T15:08:44  <antimatroid1> oh wait hang on
2010-10-26T15:08:56  <a1k0n> so taking your own neutral would pay for itself before your enemy's "light cone" intersects yours
2010-10-26T15:09:08  <antimatroid1> yeah, if there are more than 9 ships at the neutrals the best you can do is wait and dra
2010-10-26T15:09:09  <antimatroid1> w
2010-10-26T15:09:40  <antimatroid1> it also gets a lot more tricky when planets are changing ownership multiple times in the future
2010-10-26T15:10:07  <JamesMG> I'd be tempted to send one ship to my neutral in this case
2010-10-26T15:10:16  <JamesMG> just to try and trick the other player into "sniping" it for me
2010-10-26T15:10:38  <a1k0n> i doubt that would work with anyone's bot
2010-10-26T15:10:46  <JamesMG> shouldn't with most of them
2010-10-26T15:10:59  <JamesMG> it just feels better than relying entirely on chance :)
2010-10-26T15:11:01  <lavalamp_> yeah ok... send 46 ships to their planet, and 27 to each neutral...
2010-10-26T15:11:54  <lavalamp_> gahh even this map is insanely complicated

2010-10-26T15:12:15  <antimatroid1> yeah, it's a ridiculously hard game
2010-10-26T15:12:34  <antimatroid1> there's just so many possible moves
2010-10-26T15:12:35  <lavalamp_> I think that beats waiting, expanding, and attacking

2010-10-26T15:13:13  <lavalamp_> :(
2010-10-26T15:13:39  <antimatroid1> i have an idea
2010-10-26T15:14:01  <antimatroid1> i'm going to write a program to iterate best responses to moves by the other player for simple maps like this
2010-10-26T15:14:14  <antimatroid1> and see if it can't converge on winning /drawing first strategies
2010-10-26T15:14:17  <a1k0n> i actually wrote that program
2010-10-26T15:14:20  <antimatroid1> it may cycle on me though
2010-10-26T15:14:29  <antimatroid1> how'd it go?
2010-10-26T15:14:32  <a1k0n> but it finds all possible moves exhaustively, and.. there are a lot
2010-10-26T15:14:43  <antimatroid1> yeah, it wouldn't be for the bot
2010-10-26T15:14:44  <a1k0n> i had to limit depth and make assumptions
2010-10-26T15:14:49  <a1k0n> well right
2010-10-26T15:15:19  <a1k0n> 100 ships is too many to search exhaustively
2010-10-26T15:15:20  <antimatroid1> i'm curious about getting solutions to some of the simpler maps
2010-10-26T15:15:22  <antimatroid1> it's very very hard
2010-10-26T15:15:52  <raedwulf> meh they took a long while to even solve connect 4
2010-10-26T15:15:56  <raedwulf> and you're trying to solve this
2010-10-26T15:15:57  <raedwulf> :P
2010-10-26T15:16:04  <a1k0n> what i have now makes a map with 10-n-n-10 (similar to your setup), 2 steps between all planets, n varies
2010-10-26T15:16:58  <antimatroid1> raedwulf: it's hard to solve situations with even 3-4 planets
2010-10-26T15:17:02  <a1k0n> it generates a score for all player 1 moves
2010-10-26T15:17:19  <antimatroid1> i do have a game theory library, maybe i should try and brute force nash equilibria

2010-10-26T16:27:29  <lavalamp_> So I always run a control bot as well as the one I'm testing
2010-10-26T16:27:56  <bhasker> probably is as-d* and hazard and accoun bots were all up my bot will be at 350ish
2010-10-26T16:28:00  <bhasker> if*
2010-10-26T16:28:03  <janzert> Well... I'm most comfortable using pre-made (tested) packages from a repository, I'm less comfortable using a .deb, I'm even less comfortable using a released archive, and I don't know yet if I want to touch pulling from source control
2010-10-26T16:28:50  <lavalamp_> hmmm
2010-10-26T16:28:59  <janzert> but I suppose a shell script showing exactly what needs to be done would help if I get over that :)
2010-10-26T16:29:31  <lavalamp_> hm does it need to be installed for all users or does one user do the compiling?
2010-10-26T16:29:59  <janzert> well, one user on the main server and one user on each worker
2010-10-26T16:30:25  <janzert> remember that I have to incorporate anything into installing on each worker too
2010-10-26T16:30:32  <lavalamp_> ok so I can install to the user's home directory?
2010-10-26T16:30:45  <lavalamp_> right, do you have a script or something that sets them up?

2010-10-26T16:33:28  <janzert> lavalamp_: yep
2010-10-26T16:34:43  <lavalamp_> would you prefer I do something like unzip an archive or use hg to download and compile like I do on my system?
2010-10-26T16:34:51  <Zannick> lol
2010-10-26T16:34:51  <mega1> out of the 999 maps there are 100 duplicates
2010-10-26T16:35:00  <lavalamp_> mega1: lol
2010-10-26T16:35:10  <janzert> if there is a release archive that would be preferable
2010-10-26T16:35:24  <janzert> don't need to worry about adding hg to each worker that way
2010-10-26T16:35:32  <lavalamp_> makes sense
2010-10-26T16:35:59  <lavalamp_> ok so perhaps I should just make binaries?
2010-10-26T16:36:32  <lavalamp_> hm, it would need the packages, too
2010-10-26T16:36:43  <lavalamp_> I can prebuild it
2010-10-26T16:37:45  <lavalamp_> that way I just extract an archive and put some binaries in the right spot (or modify PATH)
2010-10-26T16:38:16  <janzert> where would they be hosted?
2010-10-26T16:38:48  <janzert> I'm really quite surprised the go people have no release archives available
2010-10-26T16:38:57  <lavalamp_> it's a language in flux
2010-10-26T16:39:09  <lavalamp_> there's someone who makes windows binaries
2010-10-26T16:39:42  <lavalamp_> I'll see if I have enough space at bitbucket to put it up

2010-10-26T16:41:00  <mega1> apparently map201 - map300 are all the same
2010-10-26T16:41:31  <janzert> or do we have to pick an arbitrary revision and hope it's stable
2010-10-26T16:42:12  * janzert really really doesn't want to be pulling from the head of a development branch
2010-10-26T16:43:32  <mega1> but those maps are not listed on http://72.44.46.68/getmaps, so the problem is known I guess
2010-10-26T16:44:14  <lavalamp_> janzert, yeah, they tag the releases

2010-10-26T16:44:44  <JamesMG> Can you bring me up to speed on C#?  I'll go install a VM and work on it if it'll help
2010-10-26T16:44:50  <JamesMG> rather than rewrite my bot... :(
2010-10-26T16:45:37  <janzert> JamesMG: basically all the versions available for ubuntu 8.04 leak semaphores like crazy and eventually will crash on start up
2010-10-26T16:46:05  <janzert> at this point I've given up on getting something that doesn't leak and am just trying to clean the semaphores up after it
2010-10-26T16:46:22  <JamesMG> That's nasty
2010-10-26T16:46:22  <Error323> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=717545 hahah
2010-10-26T16:46:50  <janzert> I'm hopeful that I've actually accomplished that on the workers now, but letting it run for a bit before I port it back to the main server
2010-10-26T16:47:11  <lavalamp_> ok janzert, I will try to come up with something tonight or tomorrow morning
2010-10-26T16:47:27  <janzert> lavalamp_: sounds good, thanks
2010-10-26T16:48:30  <lavalamp_> submitting stuff for the servers won't get my entry disqualified, will it? :)
2010-10-26T16:48:45  <janzert> nope as long as you don't have access to the servers
2010-10-26T16:49:04  <lavalamp_> ok
2010-10-26T16:49:15  <janzert> btw, if we are pulling an archive anyway building from source isn't going to be a big deal and may be preferable
2010-10-26T16:49:25  <lavalamp_> ok
2010-10-26T16:49:48  <lavalamp_> in that case I can just pull from the official site and update to a specific release
2010-10-26T16:50:09  <janzert> unless I suppose there are a bunch of dependencies needed to build it but not run it
2010-10-26T16:50:33  <lavalamp_> There are, but I think you'll have them already for building c/c++ programs
2010-10-26T16:51:02  <janzert> yeah, if it's just the basic compiler and such. if it's a bunch of libraries probably not
2010-10-26T16:51:16  <lavalamp_> no special libraries, I don't think
2010-10-26T16:51:31  <lavalamp_> ok in that case it should be pretty easy
2010-10-26T16:52:48  <janzert> ok, well working from the 8.04 virtualbox letting the game_server_build script set it up should let you know what dependencies are already there or not
2010-10-26T16:53:52  <lavalamp_> exactly
2010-10-26T16:54:17  <lavalamp_> does that script have any dependancies?
2010-10-26T16:54:44  <janzert> shouldn't I think I've got it so it should work from a vanilla 8.04 install
2010-10-26T16:54:51  <lavalamp_> great
2010-10-26T16:55:19  <janzert> in fact using ubuntu-8.04.4-server-i386.iso in virtualbox here for testing
2010-10-26T16:56:48  <lavalamp_> oh are they 32 bit systems or 64?
2010-10-26T16:57:08  <lavalamp_> well, it won't matter for the script
2010-10-26T16:57:18  <janzert> 32bit
2010-10-26T16:57:46  <lavalamp_> hm maybe I should lose my float64's lol

2010-10-26T21:16:39  <antimatroid1> my stupid bot refuses to make more than 1 move on the first turn
2010-10-26T21:16:47  <antimatroid1> it works well sometimes and ruins me other times
2010-10-26T21:17:51  <rebelxt> antimatroid1: yeah it can make you lose on some maps. have you seen george's bot? he normally only makes one move on the first turn, and still manages to win most games. interesting
2010-10-26T21:19:29  <antimatroid1> my bot does a decent job at winning off one move
2010-10-26T21:19:31  <antimatroid1> but i need to fix it

2010-10-26T21:23:25  <antimatroid1> that's good, hopefully it's at least competitive for the top 50 this time

2010-10-26T21:24:03  <rebelxt> top 10 is going to be hard this time, but possible with lots of work

2010-10-26T23:46:47  <antimatroid1> 4 ships**
2010-10-26T23:47:03  *** tapwater <tapwater!~tapwater@cpe-70-112-192-229.austin.res.rr.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-26T23:47:20  <antimatroid1> atm it's just worrying about the ships you can send this turn, that's bad but otherwise he gets crippled
2010-10-26T23:47:30  <McLeopold> at turn 14 you can see 2 fleets, a 35 and a 34
2010-10-26T23:48:08  <antimatroid1> nope?
2010-10-26T23:48:09  <McLeopold> I'm referring to my fleets, the 17, 4 and 1

2010-10-26T23:48:27  <McLeopold> they go straight for the neutral 10 up top after you take it.
2010-10-26T23:48:32  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-10-26T23:48:35  * raedwulf and zombies are related
2010-10-26T23:48:48  <McLeopold> I think you should have been able to foresee that at the time you launched for the 67 neutral
2010-10-26T23:48:50  <antimatroid1> i do future stuff for everything but you potentially taking my planet
2010-10-26T23:49:00  <antimatroid1> i am not considering the other planet atm
2010-10-26T23:49:05  <antimatroid1> i removed that as i had too many bugs
2010-10-26T23:49:16  <antimatroid1> i'm ironing things out before reintroducing the other player making moves
2010-10-26T23:49:24  <antimatroid1> other player*** gah sorry
2010-10-26T23:50:08  <McLeopold> but, the fleets are already sent.  shouldn't you be able to run the battle calcs and see that it would be lost?  It's not a prediction of what I may do.
2010-10-26T23:50:48  <McLeopold> The funny thing is, after you take that 67 neutral, you see the 12 fleet I send and protect with a 1 fleet.
2010-10-26T23:51:08  <antimatroid1> oh i see what you mean
2010-10-26T23:51:38  <antimatroid1> the problem is the expectedclosestfriend is less than or equal to closest friend atm
2010-10-26T23:51:43  <antimatroid1> i need to fix that
2010-10-26T23:52:16  <McLeopold> ah, distance calculations getting in the way?
2010-10-26T23:52:56  <antimatroid1> if it didn't count that as a friend it never would have considered expanding there, so yeah
2010-10-26T23:52:57  <davidjliu> now taking bets on whether bocsimacko will when 25 in a row on the official server... heh
2010-10-26T23:53:21  <McLeopold> what's the payoff?
2010-10-26T23:53:35  <antimatroid1> that would be a terrible bet to make
2010-10-26T23:53:58  <Frontier> heads for 25 in a row!
2010-10-26T23:54:00  <Frontier> !coin
2010-10-26T23:54:11  <Frontier> damn... what was the command again?
2010-10-26T23:54:24  <McLeopold> too bad the octopus died, we could've asked him
2010-10-26T23:54:26  <davidjliu> it's taken him 16 wins to get to around 15th, so he only needs nine more now
2010-10-26T23:54:32  <davidjliu> lol, heh. poor Paul

2010-10-26T23:58:17  <antimatroid1> accoun has a lot of trouble on the main site
2010-10-26T23:58:42  <McLeopold> he's bot is geared for winning against other good bots
2010-10-26T23:59:08  <antimatroid1> in that it waits too much?
2010-10-26T23:59:16  <McLeopold> when someone takes a wild stab at the center, he doesn't do so well.
2010-10-26T23:59:35  <antimatroid1> it depends how much i have spare whether i win or lose that
2010-10-26T23:59:39  <McLeopold> He builds very fast, but doesn't pay attention to position.
2010-10-26T23:59:47  <McLeopold> as much
2010-10-26T23:59:54  <antimatroid1> i took out anything about position too
2010-10-26T23:59:59  <McLeopold> It's still a very good bot.
