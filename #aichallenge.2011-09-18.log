2011-09-18T00:50:29  <ChrisH> Is there anyone here who can help me figure out why my submission won't compile. It works for me locally, but not on the beta server and the error message the beta server reports isn't very helpful.
2011-09-18T00:53:19  <eashoka> ChrishH : check for any class or some other dependency which is in ur platform but not in the bundle u submitted ...
2011-09-18T00:53:51  <ChrisH> I already did.
2011-09-18T00:55:22  <eashoka> eashoka : r using a tool like Ant to package or doing it manually ?
2011-09-18T00:56:14  <ChrisH> I have submitted a very minimal bot just to verify the server will compile it, and it claimed to once but then failed in one game.
2011-09-18T00:56:26  <ChrisH> A couple days ago I was on here and some of the organizers were discussing some discrepencies between the main server and the workers causing my bot to fail.
2011-09-18T00:57:04  <ChrisH> eashoka: no, but I am using Go, which apparently is not well tested on the beta server.
2011-09-18T00:57:06  <eashoka> eashoka : ah ok. what's the language u sued ?
2011-09-18T00:57:16  <eashoka> ah ok.
2011-09-18T00:57:36  <ChrisH> So I'm here to help work it out, but I must say I'm getting frustrated.
2011-09-18T00:58:07  <ChrisH> I posted on the forum two days ago, but no response yet.
2011-09-18T00:58:44  <ChrisH> IRC seems to be better when I can find someone, but even then ... not sure what more I can do.
2011-09-18T00:59:11  <ChrisH> I have been told that the servers are running Go version r.60.
2011-09-18T00:59:17  <ChrisH> And that's what I am using as well.
2011-09-18T00:59:37  <ChrisH> My code runs properly when compiled on my machine and tested with the latest tools from Github.
2011-09-18T00:59:54  <ChrisH> e.g. play_one_game.sh, etc.
2011-09-18T01:00:18  <ChrisH> Any suggestions how I can move forward to help resolve whatever the problem is?
2011-09-18T01:00:23  <eashoka> eashoka : there aren't many Go users I think. did u have a look at source code of Go framework classes ?
2011-09-18T01:01:17  <ChrisH> True, gobang2 is the only other one listed on the beta server.
2011-09-18T01:01:40  <ChrisH> I did have a look at the Go sample bot.
2011-09-18T01:01:52  <ChrisH> I tried uploading it unchanged and it also failed to compile.
2011-09-18T01:03:12  <ChrisH> It would really help if I could get the compile error messages, but all I see is: "Output file _go_.6 was not created." which doesn't really tell me much.
2011-09-18T01:04:16  <eashoka> what is _go_.6 ?
2011-09-18T01:06:36  <ChrisH> The file extension of .6 means it is a compiled version of a Go module targeted for an 64 bit x86 architecture.
2011-09-18T01:06:47  <ChrisH> It's like a .o file for C or C++
2011-09-18T01:10:39  <eashoka> just wondering. r u submitting a similar file with ur source code as well or u r submitting only the source code ?
2011-09-18T01:11:57  <ChrisH> Only the source.
2011-09-18T01:12:34  <ChrisH> I'm looking through the worker/compiler.py code now to see if I can figure out how the server runs the Go compiler.
2011-09-18T01:13:58  <eashoka> Chrish : g8, I think that's a promising way forward. If that fails too (hope not :-) ), u can always try with another language to be familiar with the competition until this issue get eventually resolved.
2011-09-18T01:14:59  <ChrisH> Well, I can always work on my bot locally as well, but I don't want to sink too much time into doing it in Go if the language won't really be supported.
2011-09-18T01:21:04  <ChrisH> eashoka: I'm simulating the same compiler commands that the server uses and starting to get an idea of what's going on.
2011-09-18T01:23:39  <eashoka> ChrisH : glad to hear!

2011-09-18T01:25:52  <ChrisH> I have my code split into multiple files (lexer.go, parser.go, map.go, MyBot.go, etc.) and the code in worker/compile.py doesn't handle that properly for Go.

2011-09-18T01:31:01  <ChrisH> antimatroid: ok
2011-09-18T01:32:32  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I have taken a look at the latest worker/compiler.py code and I know why my Go code won't compile on the server and I also have a suggestion for an improvement to compile.py that would fix the problem. Are you interested?
2011-09-18T01:33:34  <antimatroid> ChrisH: he might not actually be here, is there much of a change to the file? you could submit a pull request on github if you know how (i'm not very knowledgeable with github)
2011-09-18T01:33:48  <antimatroid> then someone should be able to just take a look at the changes and let it come through
2011-09-18T01:33:59  <ChrisH> I already did a pull before browsing the code.
2011-09-18T01:34:34  <antimatroid> yeah, i think a pull request let's you upload changes to go through once someone with privileges allows it
2011-09-18T01:34:43  <antimatroid> (I am not good with github :))
2011-09-18T01:35:11  <ChrisH> hmmm, I understand pull to retrieve the latest changes from the server (I'm not great at git either).
2011-09-18T01:36:13  <ChrisH> I can do some reading though, I'm sure I can figure it out given a little time.

2011-09-18T01:58:36  <ChrisH> Well, now I'm not so sure that I have this figured out.
2011-09-18T02:00:35  <ChrisH> I tried merging all my code into a single MyBot.go source file and submit it, but the server still fails to compile it. In addition I just noticed a part of worker/compiler.py that seems to handle the muliple source file situation for Go properly. So I'm back to being stumped and wishing I could see more information about the errors the compiler is producing.
2011-09-18T02:13:19  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I did some further testing. I ran compiler.py on my machine with both a single source file and with multiple source files and both worked correctly, resulting in a fully functional bot that works with play_one_game.sh, so I can only assume that the problem is a difference in the Go environment on my machine and on the servers. I will need help from the organizers to figure that out.

2011-09-18T09:52:44  <mcstar> or whatnot
2011-09-18T09:53:02  <mleise> and I would put all projects in /eclipse_projects, so they don't show up inside the source directories at all

2011-09-18T09:59:08  <ChrisH> McLeopold: So that left me with the assumption that there was some type of compile error, and thus no _go_.6 file generated (which is all the server tells me), and if I saw the compile errors I might have a better idea what the real problem was.
2011-09-18T09:59:16  <mcstar> whats the difference between suns jre and openjdk? are the hotspots different? or just the libraries? whats the diff. in startup speed?
2011-09-18T09:59:28  <McLeopold> ChrisH: It's probably the SplitN issue
2011-09-18T09:59:44  *** jako <jako!5b2cbce4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.44.188.228> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-18T09:59:45  <McLeopold> I'm checking why you are not getting a full error message now.
2011-09-18T09:59:50  <ChrisH> McLeopold:  What's that?  I don't use SplitN in my code, BTW.
2011-09-18T10:00:13  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Doesn't mean it isn't used by something I do call though.
2011-09-18T10:00:16  <McLeopold> or the __MACOSX directory
2011-09-18T10:00:29  <mleise> mcstar: I think openjdk is a complete open-source implementation of java
2011-09-18T10:00:44  <ChrisH> I gotta go for a bit, be back later.

2011-09-18T10:00:53  <mleise> that is - for many - reason enough to use it :)
2011-09-18T10:00:55  <mcstar> i was under the impression that only one JVM exists
2011-09-18T10:01:11  <mleise> hmm, then i must be wrong
2011-09-18T10:01:22  <mcstar> im not saying that
2011-09-18T10:01:35  <mcstar> but you need a better arguemtn to convince me
2011-09-18T10:01:37  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-18T10:01:48  <McLeopold> like, one jvm at all, or just for linux?
2011-09-18T10:02:03  <mcstar> from oracle's/sun's side
2011-09-18T10:02:08  <mcstar> there are others, i know
2011-09-18T10:02:08  <mleise> it is the default in many linux distributions
2011-09-18T10:02:14  <McLeopold> JRockIt
2011-09-18T10:02:20  <McLeopold> from Oracle
2011-09-18T10:02:22  <mleise> so i think it must be open-source
2011-09-18T10:02:53  <mcstar> McLeopold: so my question is: are the jvm's for sun's proprietary java and openjdk's java are the same?
2011-09-18T10:03:59  <mcstar> jvm startup: ~10sec, sbcl ~2 sec, python ~0 sec
2011-09-18T10:04:11  <mleise> python 0 ? Oo
2011-09-18T10:04:14  <mcstar> im staying with python for my scripts
2011-09-18T10:04:19  <mcstar> essentially 0
2011-09-18T10:04:41  <mleise> yeah, don't load up a 'platform' just for a script ;)
2011-09-18T10:04:44  <mcstar> i dont like it(the stupid identation) but python is very good for certain tasks
2011-09-18T10:06:17  <mcstar> i came across a hint that jvm can be started in "server" mode? to reduce initial startup time, and after that all processes spawn from that one
2011-09-18T10:06:30  <mcstar> do you know anything about this? i couldnt find details
2011-09-18T10:06:55  <McLeopold> indentation is clean, I like it, so does CoffeeScript
2011-09-18T10:06:59  <mcstar> sry, to amortize initial startup time*
2011-09-18T10:07:12  <mleise> mcstar: no idea, but I know that applets are loaded into one VM
2011-09-18T10:07:27  <mcstar> McLeopold: its very hard to follow levels of indentation through pages
2011-09-18T10:07:27  <mleise> so a web site with many applets has the startup time of only one VM
2011-09-18T10:08:15  <McLeopold> mcstar: yes it is.  I've heard the argument that if it is too hard, you probably need to refactor
2011-09-18T10:08:42  <mcstar> yeah, i heard that too :)
2011-09-18T10:08:57  <mcstar> the problem, is that indentation changes semantics
2011-09-18T10:09:10  <McLeopold> well, that's the benifit if you like it :)
2011-09-18T10:09:23  <mcstar> it happended to me that i un-indented a code-segment, which belonged to a conditional
2011-09-18T10:10:02  <mcstar> basically, i think what im saying is that an end-delimiter would come handy
2011-09-18T10:10:20  <mcstar> it would help the editor to understand the code too
2011-09-18T10:10:37  <mleise> no semicolon, but {} ?
2011-09-18T10:10:59  <McLeopold> that last argument doesn't make sense, the editor should be able to read indentation just like the interpreter
2011-09-18T10:11:38  <McLeopold> unless by editor, you mean you?
2011-09-18T10:11:40  <mcstar> McLeopold: it would understand if something were to belong to a something:
2011-09-18T10:11:45  <mcstar> hehe
2011-09-18T10:11:46  <mcstar> nooo
2011-09-18T10:11:55  <mcstar> something:
2011-09-18T10:12:00  <mcstar>      statement1
2011-09-18T10:12:03  <mcstar>       statement2
2011-09-18T10:12:14  <mcstar> the editor doesnt know where sattement2 belongs
2011-09-18T10:12:25  <mcstar> forget thet 1 space
2011-09-18T10:12:30  <McLeopold> of course it does, it uses the indentation levels
2011-09-18T10:12:34  <mcstar> nono
2011-09-18T10:12:39  <mcstar> the editor should indent for me
2011-09-18T10:12:51  <mcstar> you see what i mean?
2011-09-18T10:12:57  <mcstar> i dont want to keep track of indentation
2011-09-18T10:13:10  <McLeopold> oh, then no, you have to type tab or backspace at some point in your life
2011-09-18T10:13:18  <mleise> hehe
2011-09-18T10:13:22  <mcstar> maybe i f up, idk, but i put in an end clause, than C-M-q and voila, its done
2011-09-18T10:14:24  <mcstar> another problem, is that python should reject beginning of line tabs
2011-09-18T10:14:39  <mcstar> it should be standard to accept only sapces
2011-09-18T10:15:00  <mcstar> i think even hard-ass pythoners agree with this
2011-09-18T10:15:02  <mcstar> dont you?
2011-09-18T10:15:07  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-18T10:15:14  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-18T10:15:32  <McLeopold> some people want tabs, even if it is against pep8
2011-09-18T10:15:52  <mcstar> against what?
2011-09-18T10:16:10  <McLeopold> http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
2011-09-18T10:16:57  <mcstar> forgive me if i dont read that page
2011-09-18T10:17:12  <mcstar> i guess it argues for my point right?
2011-09-18T10:17:47  <mcstar> McLeopold: did you use emacs with python?
2011-09-18T10:18:21  <McLeopold> no, I haven't gotten into emacs yet
2011-09-18T10:18:30  <mcstar> i still find python editing unconfortable as long as i cant dynamically execute my code, and re-evaluate revious whole expressions
2011-09-18T10:18:41  <McLeopold> IPython
2011-09-18T10:18:47  <mcstar> thats not good enough
2011-09-18T10:18:52  <mcstar> at least not the terminal version
2011-09-18T10:18:59  <mcstar> maybe the gui a bit better
2011-09-18T10:19:03  <McLeopold> http://ipython.org/
2011-09-18T10:19:09  <mcstar> what IS better, is pySclices
2011-09-18T10:19:20  <mleise> "For new projects, spaces-only are strongly recommended over tabs."
2011-09-18T10:19:21  <mcstar> Slices
2011-09-18T10:19:33  <mcstar> and the other is sage's we interface
2011-09-18T10:19:37  <mleise> I like my tabs
2011-09-18T10:19:42  <mcstar> McLeopold: have you heard of sagemath?
2011-09-18T10:20:25  <mcstar> its a glue-every-opensource-math-project-with-python-together CAS
2011-09-18T10:20:45  <mcstar> it has a very good notebook-like interface, that you access from the browser
2011-09-18T10:21:05  <mcstar> you have cells, you type in it, it can send that input to different interpreters
2011-09-18T10:21:16  <mcstar> python/maxima/sage/bash/mathematica
2011-09-18T10:21:38  <mcstar> and displays the results, inline graphics, inline 3d java visualization
2011-09-18T10:22:00  <mcstar> and you can save the notebooks, and manage them, and easily share them on the network if you want to
2011-09-18T10:22:13  <mcstar> it was quite good for python editing
2011-09-18T10:22:26  <mcstar> but ultimately i want to use emacs
2011-09-18T10:23:06  <mcstar> but i havent succeeded with all the dependencies yet, the py-shell throuws errors
2011-09-18T10:24:44  <mcstar> back to the indentation/syntax: one of the main reasons i really lile lisp, is that indentation doesnt change the semantics, its indentation is very canonical, and it doesnt have precedence rules!
2011-09-18T10:34:08  <mcstar> sorry, did i short-circuit something?

2011-09-18T12:04:28  <eashoka> So next week would be the grand official launch ? (being programmers, everybody knows there could be fixes even after the launch)
2011-09-18T12:05:43  <eashoka> yea release candidate sounds much better :-)

2011-09-18T12:44:18  <eashoka> for some reason, workers are running blazing fast right now. a whopping 25 players per minute!
2011-09-18T12:44:57  <mcstar> i got to seet hat
2011-09-18T12:46:18  <mcstar> eashoka: keep in mind that games are cut at 255 turns

2011-09-18T12:49:46  <mleise> lol the timeout almost matches the turn limit
2011-09-18T12:50:08  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-18T12:50:41  <mcstar> i dont really understand why is the timeout soo long?
2011-09-18T12:50:45  <mcstar> 3 minutes?
2011-09-18T12:51:17  <mcstar> it happened many times, that i typed up quite some in 3 minutes, just for my friend to timout than of course when he reconnects al is gone
2011-09-18T12:51:18  <mleise> That strikes me sometimes as well. The internet is so fast nowadays that you don't need that.
2011-09-18T12:51:28  <mcstar> cause my private channel is not logged :)
2011-09-18T12:53:16  <mcstar> mleise: do you communicate with friends through irc? or you use some other IM?
2011-09-18T12:53:35  <mleise> others: ICQ and MSN networks
2011-09-18T12:53:53  <mleise> logged of course ;)
2011-09-18T12:54:07  <mcstar> i tried pidgin with google-talk
2011-09-18T12:54:16  <mcstar> the channel was always noise
2011-09-18T12:54:23  <mcstar> so we only use irc atm
2011-09-18T12:54:34  <mcstar> noisy*

2011-09-18T13:32:48  <antimatroid> i need to stick a name on something and it seems there isn't one
2011-09-18T13:33:02  <amstan> antimatroid: lemur?
2011-09-18T13:33:08  <antimatroid> in the case that i have the Cartesian product of two sets my object is a bijection
2011-09-18T13:33:56  <mcstar> i think THAT is an antimatroid
2011-09-18T13:34:17  <mcstar> so, lets just call it nick, for short
2011-09-18T13:34:46  <antimatroid> say what? :P
2011-09-18T13:36:27  <antimatroid> oh, you might be right aha
2011-09-18T13:36:36  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-18T13:37:02  <antimatroid> it's a lot like it otherwise
2011-09-18T13:37:33  <antimatroid> L is just one set right? I sort of have to take the alphabet as different for each place in the word
2011-09-18T13:37:45  <antimatroid> and the words are fixed length
2011-09-18T13:39:13  <amstan> matroid?
2011-09-18T13:39:24  <mcstar> there are too many unknows so that i really cant be more contructive
2011-09-18T13:39:37  <amstan> antimatroid: problem with naming stuff after yourself is.. you might need to name something else after yourself later
2011-09-18T13:39:47  <amstan> it gets weird when a lot of things are named after you
2011-09-18T13:39:53  <antimatroid> amstan: i would never name something after myself
2011-09-18T13:39:59  <amstan> so you'll have to make a wikipedia disambiguation page
2011-09-18T13:40:14  <amstan> \o/
2011-09-18T13:40:28  <antimatroid> matroids and antimatroids are mathematical objects

2011-09-18T13:53:07  <antimatroid> should a fair game be considered symmetric?
2011-09-18T13:53:29  <antimatroid> or should a game be symmetric if each player is playing every other player symmetrically?

2011-09-18T13:54:35  <antimatroid> i know
2011-09-18T13:54:43  <antimatroid> i still don't have a clear answer :P

2011-09-18T13:55:02  <mcstar> did you talk to that physics professor you told me you will?
2011-09-18T13:55:04  <antimatroid> that's an example of a fair game that i'm not sure of whether to call symmetric
2011-09-18T13:55:17  <antimatroid> not sure what about?
2011-09-18T13:55:36  <antimatroid> 1 is the row player, 2 is the col player and 3 is the matrix player
2011-09-18T13:55:36  <mcstar> these things, mainly symmetry
2011-09-18T13:55:42  <mcstar> as far aas i can remember
2011-09-18T13:55:48  <mcstar> though, it was couple months ago
2011-09-18T13:55:55  <mcstar> but you never told me what happened
2011-09-18T13:56:12  <antimatroid> you can find a symmetry of the game with (123) as the permutation of the players, but not for a transposition (12),(13),(23) of the players
2011-09-18T13:56:38  <antimatroid> oh, i've solved most of my maths problems, i'm just caught on what to call thigns etc. now
2011-09-18T13:58:20  <mcstar> ill take a look at that, but i cant give advices and think about game theory at once
2011-09-18T13:58:36  <mcstar> "/onhold #aichannel
2011-09-18T14:03:01  <antimatroid> i don't need it verified, i've checked :P
2011-09-18T14:03:47  <antimatroid> wikipedia says " If the symmetry group of x is the trivial group then x is said to be asymmetric, otherwise symmetric.", but that would have a game be symmetric even if you could only swap 2 players and not all of them
2011-09-18T14:04:17  <mcstar> antimatroid: i didnt mean that, i would like to think thatover, but i cant atm
2011-09-18T14:04:52  <antimatroid> :) fair enough

2011-09-18T14:34:52  <delt0r_> mcstar: openjdk and sun JDK are not the same
2011-09-18T14:35:08  <mcstar> delt0r_: the jvm?
2011-09-18T14:35:24  <mcstar> also called hotspot if im correct
2011-09-18T14:35:26  <delt0r_> openjdk is a little behind and there are still some things that can't be OS
2011-09-18T14:35:43  <delt0r_> yea JVM+standard libs
2011-09-18T14:36:08  <delt0r_> for the most part openJDK works well and is only a little slower
2011-09-18T14:36:26  <mcstar> im just wondering what would be better for clojure, since it mostly uses the jvm, and some other code
2011-09-18T14:36:26  <delt0r_> but there are some areas where it dies a horrible death
2011-09-18T14:36:44  <delt0r_> I would always recommend the sun JVM
2011-09-18T14:37:23  <mcstar> you know recently happened that distros can no longer distribute it
2011-09-18T14:38:03  <delt0r_> oh god not more RS bs?
2011-09-18T14:38:21  <delt0r_> you know outside the US it is perfectly legal
2011-09-18T14:38:23  <mcstar> bs i know, whats rs?
2011-09-18T14:38:32  <delt0r_> Richard Stallman
2011-09-18T14:38:36  <mcstar> no
2011-09-18T14:38:44  <mcstar> java changed the licence
2011-09-18T14:38:59  <delt0r_> openjdk
2011-09-18T14:39:00  <delt0r_> or sun
2011-09-18T14:39:01  <mcstar> sun jre jdk disappeared from arch's repositories
2011-09-18T14:39:16  <mcstar> sry, i mean sun of course
2011-09-18T14:39:22  <mcstar> not java
2011-09-18T14:39:23  <delt0r_> since the sun jre has never been distributed in any of the linuxs i am exposed

2011-09-18T14:40:08  <delt0r_> ok... non story... most already didn't --apple are going to stop too
2011-09-18T14:40:36  <delt0r_> but then its like they have a lisp VM or anything either... installing one is not so hard.
2011-09-18T14:40:46  <delt0r_> not like
2011-09-18T14:41:16  <mcstar> i know its not hard, thats not the point
2011-09-18T14:41:30  <mcstar> the point is that you have to update it manually
2011-09-18T14:41:46  <delt0r_> at anyrate I think you could easily use openjdk for ants.
2011-09-18T14:41:47  <mcstar> fortunately, its available from AUR, a user maintaned repo
2011-09-18T14:42:11  <mcstar> i wasnt talking about ants, in particular
2011-09-18T14:42:20  <mcstar> but i think they already use the openjdk thing
2011-09-18T14:42:21  <delt0r_> but it would be more painless to use the sun one
2011-09-18T14:43:45  <delt0r_> also i install a jre with my programs to solve the "what jvm are you running"
2011-09-18T14:44:05  <delt0r_> so my install does not look like a java app
2011-09-18T14:47:44  <delt0r_> mcstar: also java is stupid easy to install --user space or global install..even without sacrificing to the package management gods
2011-09-18T14:48:08  <delt0r_> (IMO package management is a joke, on all OSes )
2011-09-18T14:48:51  <mcstar> not really
2011-09-18T14:49:03  <delt0r_> note the IMO part ;)
2011-09-18T14:49:07  <mcstar> at least my fixpoint in package-manager space was Arch's pacman
2011-09-18T14:49:11  <delt0r_> you won't convince me otherwise :D
2011-09-18T14:49:12  <mcstar> yeah

2011-09-18T14:49:19  <mcstar> prefix mine with imho too
2011-09-18T14:49:35  <delt0r_> I don't bother with humble

2011-09-18T14:49:51  <delt0r_> lol
2011-09-18T14:50:16  <delt0r_> so whats the word... will ants go live this week? next week?
2011-09-18T14:50:20  <delt0r_> what is outstanding
2011-09-18T14:50:38  <mcstar> of course tha packaga manage ris not everything, you need people who can sort the packages and dependencies sensibly
2011-09-18T14:51:08  <mcstar> it is outstanding how many people are still asking this question
2011-09-18T14:51:24  <mcstar> i guess next week it gonna be ...
2011-09-18T14:51:27  <mcstar> wait for it...

2011-09-18T16:12:52  <mcstar> did somewhere appear that the contest is srtating?
2011-09-18T16:13:13  <mcstar> starting*
2011-09-18T16:20:08  <amstan> mcstar: yeah, well, we were having pre launch meetings in july
2011-09-18T16:21:05  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm still working on a fix for the matchmaking to even out the player games, I can look at the map selection after that
2011-09-18T16:22:41  <McLeopold> janzert: also, I believe I'm ignoring priority now
2011-09-18T16:23:52  <janzert> just having priority as a binary setting (>0 are used) should be fine
2011-09-18T16:24:55  <janzert> McLeopold: also could you add a field to the map table to record the last time the turn limit was adjusted for the map (something like max_turns_adjusted maybe)
2011-09-18T16:25:05  <McLeopold> yes, I'm checking for >= 0
2011-09-18T16:25:24  <McLeopold> janzert: you can get that info from the game table
2011-09-18T16:25:36  <McLeopold> kinda
2011-09-18T16:25:37  <janzert> I don't think so
2011-09-18T16:25:55  <janzert> I'm limiting it to games with the same turn limit right now
2011-09-18T16:26:10  <janzert> but that doesn't cover if the turn limit is set back to a previous value
2011-09-18T16:26:17  <janzert> which I kind of want to do
2011-09-18T16:26:33  <McLeopold> nope, that wouldn't work then

2011-09-18T16:32:02  <janzert> Thanks. I knew the changes needed to the schema but I'm not sure how to apply that to the live database.
2011-09-18T16:32:32  <McLeopold> I just issue alter table commands
2011-09-18T16:32:57  <McLeopold> so far I haven't blown up anything
2011-09-18T16:33:01  <McLeopold> too much
2011-09-18T16:33:05  <janzert> ok, so there isn't an automatic process
2011-09-18T16:33:10  <janzert> hehe
2011-09-18T16:33:15  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-18T16:33:27  <McLeopold> I could do it the right way, but that is so much more work :)

2011-09-18T16:35:41  <janzert> limited to games with max_turns of 255
2011-09-18T16:35:47  <McLeopold> okay
2011-09-18T16:35:59  <McLeopold> that is bad :(
2011-09-18T16:36:14  <McLeopold> oh, my logic doesn't though
2011-09-18T16:37:31  <janzert> yeah, there are half a dozen maps with single digit games and 3 with over 200 :(
2011-09-18T16:41:50  <mleise> Add some fun maps while you are at it. Mazes, pictograms, etc... where is the map editor *sigh*
2011-09-18T16:42:58  <mleise> They aren't good gameplay wise, but a themed map now and then would be a real highlight.
2011-09-18T16:48:52  <McLeopold> janzert: it looks like for all time the matchmaker is doing a good job and keeping them even, given the fact that for 2 months it was out of wack
2011-09-18T16:49:28  <janzert> ok
2011-09-18T16:49:44  <McLeopold> we just need a way to reset the game count to a point in time
2011-09-18T16:49:47  <janzert> but then the question is why are they so out of whack for the last week(?)
2011-09-18T16:50:10  <janzert> ahh, the matchmaker is still looking at all time numbers?
2011-09-18T16:50:13  <McLeopold> because the algo is trying to keep stuff even, and a bunch a maps where played too much before
2011-09-18T16:50:16  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-18T16:50:21  <janzert> ok
2011-09-18T16:50:41  <McLeopold> how did you do finals last year?
2011-09-18T16:50:48  <McLeopold> did you wipe the database?
2011-09-18T16:50:48  <janzert> yeah, we need a way to limit it to look at things only after a certain point
2011-09-18T16:51:14  <janzert> I moved all the game information from before the finals into archive tables
2011-09-18T16:51:27  <janzert> so basically from the point of view of the matchmaking system, yes
2011-09-18T16:51:27  <McLeopold> maybe a stored procedure to do that would be nice...
2011-09-18T16:52:14  <janzert> adding a timelimit may be less disruptive?
2011-09-18T16:52:22  <janzert> whichever is easier I suppose
2011-09-18T16:56:14  <McLeopold> well, I would want something that works for the finals
2011-09-18T16:56:45  <McLeopold> archiving makes queries faster, so I'll go with that
2011-09-18T16:56:59  <McLeopold> but it disrupts looking and old games...
2011-09-18T16:57:03  <janzert> yes, I was imagining the timelimit would be set to the start of the finals
2011-09-18T16:57:36  <janzert> right, any pages that refer to games need to be modified to query the archive table if they don't find the game in the primary table
2011-09-18T16:57:55  <janzert> which is why I thought the timelimit might be less disruptive
2011-09-18T16:58:12  <janzert> so whichever way you want to do it :)
2011-09-18T16:58:38  <McLeopold> this would only affect matchmaking?
2011-09-18T16:59:02  <janzert> I can't think of anything else offhand it should effect
2011-09-18T16:59:37  <janzert> I guess leaderboard generation but that is completely incremental so shouldn't need it
2011-09-18T16:59:52  <McLeopold> right, submissions can be reset if we want
2011-09-18T17:00:17  <McLeopold> just game counts in the rankings table
2011-09-18T17:00:23  <janzert> yep, I believe reseting mu and sigma should be all that is needed there
2011-09-18T17:00:57  <janzert> hmm, yeah
2011-09-18T17:01:18  <McLeopold> I'm storing those in the submission table right now, so that the rankings are faster
2011-09-18T17:01:25  <janzert> although I think I'd like for the rate field to go away at least in the default view before we go live
2011-09-18T17:01:33  <McLeopold> it's duplicate data, but it allows us to reset the tally
2011-09-18T17:01:40  <janzert> ahh
2011-09-18T17:01:53  <McLeopold> not at all?
2011-09-18T17:02:05  <McLeopold> I mean, you don't want to display that info?
2011-09-18T17:02:23  <janzert> the rate information would be nice to still have for admins or those interested to view, but I think it's bad for the normal view
2011-09-18T17:02:42  <McLeopold> ok

2011-09-18T17:47:25  <McLeopold> janzert: I have an idea for a new matchup generator
2011-09-18T17:49:26  <janzert> hmm, do I want to hear it... ;)
2011-09-18T17:49:31  <McLeopold> ok...
2011-09-18T17:49:41  <McLeopold> select a seed, last to have played
2011-09-18T17:50:06  <McLeopold> select 10% of the other bots with the best match quality, according to trueskill
2011-09-18T17:50:21  <McLeopold> pick the player that has played the least with the seed
2011-09-18T17:50:58  <McLeopold> for the 3rd player, again select 10%, but the match quality is calculated for all 3
2011-09-18T17:51:23  <McLeopold> again, select the player that has played the least, but with both player 1 & 2
2011-09-18T17:51:31  <McLeopold> repeat until you have enough
2011-09-18T17:51:47  <McLeopold> I think this removes the need for my "no repeat" logic
2011-09-18T17:52:08  <McLeopold> And this will solve the problem of match quality favoring those with low sigma/high game counts
2011-09-18T17:52:46  <McLeopold> all based off user_id, so submitting new bots won't increase your chances of playing again
2011-09-18T17:53:08  <janzert> hmm, let me think about it for a minute, initial is impression isn't bad though ;)
2011-09-18T17:53:42  <McLeopold> if you suddenly submit a new bot that improves, putting you in a new percetile of the field, you'll start to get picked alot, which I think is good
2011-09-18T17:54:12  <McLeopold> the older bots will want to play against the newer good bot right away

2011-09-18T17:56:21  <McLeopold> 3 player might be skewed a little, but it would remain fairly even
2011-09-18T17:57:10  <McLeopold> tweaking the percentage will be the trick
2011-09-18T17:57:51  <McLeopold> we could even base it off your ranking
2011-09-18T17:58:07  <McLeopold> top bots stay at 5%, bottom bots increase to 20% or something
2011-09-18T17:58:13  <janzert> it's too bad the cutoff can't be more probababilistic
2011-09-18T17:58:50  <McLeopold> how so?
2011-09-18T17:59:25  <McLeopold> we could limit it to match quality within 5% of best match quality or something
2011-09-18T17:59:33  <janzert> i.e. the closest in skill bots would be included for consideration 100% of the time and the chances would go down in a pareto distribution as they got further away
2011-09-18T17:59:53  <McLeopold> we can do that
2011-09-18T18:00:31  <janzert> ahh, I thought that would be quite difficult to do in sql
2011-09-18T18:00:35  <McLeopold> so
2011-09-18T18:00:37  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-18T18:00:54  <McLeopold> I just need a way to calc the pareto
2011-09-18T18:03:13  <janzert> hmm, it was encoded in the last contest code at one point
2011-09-18T18:03:23  <McLeopold> really?
2011-09-18T18:03:37  <janzert> but I see the final version just used the one built into python :}
2011-09-18T18:03:48  <janzert> pretty sure it was anyway
2011-09-18T18:07:29  <McLeopold> percent of highest match quality would probably be good enough
2011-09-18T18:07:40  <McLeopold> 10% of total field might be good enough now
2011-09-18T18:08:01  <janzert> yeah, it just misses out on the occasional outlier game
2011-09-18T18:08:10  <janzert> but probably works out ok in practice
2011-09-18T18:08:19  <McLeopold> where a really good bot plays a bad bot?
2011-09-18T18:08:31  <janzert> right
2011-09-18T18:08:40  <McLeopold> so, I'm okay with that not happening
2011-09-18T18:09:05  <janzert> they should ideally happen very occasionally
2011-09-18T18:09:26  <McLeopold> well, I could muliply match quality by a random number and sort?
2011-09-18T18:10:12  <McLeopold> I still need to take a top % and do the least played logic to avoid the game counts not being even
2011-09-18T18:11:10  <janzert> really pairings outside of the 10% range should be less than 1 in a couple hundred anyway so is probably fine not to worry about them
2011-09-18T18:11:27  <McLeopold> I'll just to the multiply anyway
2011-09-18T18:12:19  <janzert> isn't your method just making the border 'fuzzier' not actually occasionally pulling in an opponent from far beyond the nominal cutoff?
2011-09-18T18:12:39  <McLeopold> it would be giving them some chance
2011-09-18T18:12:55  <McLeopold> hmm, mayby not
2011-09-18T18:13:14  <janzert> I guess what is the range and distribution of your random numbers?
2011-09-18T18:13:20  <McLeopold> 0-1
2011-09-18T18:13:29  <McLeopold> uniform

2011-09-18T18:14:26  <janzert> hmm, seems like it would be too strong and dominate the actual quality measure
2011-09-18T18:14:53  <McLeopold> I'm thinking it wouldn't be strong enough now
2011-09-18T18:15:55  <McLeopold> take the numbers 1-100 and multiply by a random 0-1 and see how often 1 is chosen, probably not much
2011-09-18T18:16:21  <McLeopold> chosen being 1*rand() is greater than all the others numbers times their own rand
2011-09-18T18:21:07  <janzert> the average of the result will half of the original average of course
2011-09-18T18:23:03  <janzert> but the range covered will decrease in size much less and my math ability to reason about random uniform distributions isn't quite good enough to say how much on average ;)
2011-09-18T18:23:32  <McLeopold> I'm writing a python test right now ;)
2011-09-18T18:23:39  <janzert> i.e. the mean will change less than the median
2011-09-18T18:23:47  <janzert> err more
2011-09-18T18:24:22  <janzert> or not
2011-09-18T18:24:30  <janzert> hehe
2011-09-18T18:26:41  <janzert> in any case I don't see how it would form any sort of a power law distribution for the opponents selected
2011-09-18T18:26:49  <janzert> which is what I'm really after

2011-09-18T18:36:12  <McLeopold> wierd
2011-09-18T18:36:22  <McLeopold> the oatmeal is going to get me...
2011-09-18T18:39:58  <janzert> the top end looks rather linear but the tail looks good
2011-09-18T18:40:27  <McLeopold> so, I think it would work
2011-09-18T18:40:44  <McLeopold> sort by match quality * random number
2011-09-18T18:42:01  <McLeopold> you still have a 1 in 20 chance if your match quality is 20% lower than the best quality to be considered at the top
2011-09-18T18:42:26  <janzert> I almost think 10% might be too large but yeah this will probably work
2011-09-18T18:42:38  <janzert> let me replot my graph in percentages
2011-09-18T18:42:41  <McLeopold> I get that from the 80 line having 49 picks
2011-09-18T18:42:45  <McLeopold> oops, 1/200
2011-09-18T18:43:48  <McLeopold> with limiting the field, then choosing the least played, if a low quality happened to get in the top X, then it will probably be chosen
2011-09-18T18:46:51  <janzert> ok, I guess 10% looks fine
2011-09-18T18:46:54  <McLeopold> given 4000 submissions, in 1000 games you would probably only play within 100 ranks up or down
2011-09-18T18:47:59  <janzert> hmm, really?
2011-09-18T18:48:10  <antimatroid> don't forget the surprise some people had with planet wars when they had to play some lower ranked players

2011-09-18T18:48:36  <janzert> it seems to me 95% of games will have the first opponent with 15% of match quality

2011-09-18T18:48:46  <McLeopold> antimatroid: that's why were discussing this, to include a small percent of those games
2011-09-18T18:49:17  <McLeopold> yes, but that may be 25% of the field

2011-09-18T18:50:01  <McLeopold> I think match quality falls off quite fast
2011-09-18T18:50:31  <janzert> anyway I'd say go ahead and give it a try and see how it looks
2011-09-18T18:50:59  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-18T18:51:08  <janzert> my feeling is that 10% may be too large but we can look at it
2011-09-18T18:52:52  <janzert> also, to see if it's actually working well I think we need to increase turn limits again so that games are actually giving reasonable results
2011-09-18T18:53:49  <McLeopold> I don't think that matters for matchmaking, does it?
2011-09-18T18:53:54  <janzert> and to do that I've got the automatic adjuster almost ready :)
2011-09-18T18:53:58  <McLeopold> are you thinking the mu's should be more spread out?
2011-09-18T18:55:02  <janzert> well the ranking system doesn't really have anything to work with when the results aren't very good indicators of skill
2011-09-18T18:55:16  <McLeopold> btw, run the opponent sp on the server to see picking to X percent and sorting by least played
2011-09-18T18:55:23  <McLeopold> call opponent();
2011-09-18T18:55:34  <janzert> and we can't look at the game quality the matchmaker is giving us when the rankings it is using aren't any good
2011-09-18T18:55:41  <McLeopold> 255 is enough to know who can gather well
2011-09-18T18:56:25  <McLeopold> but, it is fast enought, so 500 may still give us enough results
2011-09-18T18:56:40  <McLeopold> 6.8 gpm
2011-09-18T18:57:02  <janzert> don't adjust it manually yet
2011-09-18T18:57:47  <janzert> I need to test my auto adjuster ;)

2011-09-18T20:07:26  <McLeopold> ChrisH: do you use ubuntu?
2011-09-18T20:07:51  <ChrisH> Yes, in a VM, I'm running 10.10 currently.
2011-09-18T20:08:11  <McLeopold> okay, if you get the repo you can use worker.py to compile in a directory
2011-09-18T20:08:16  <ChrisH> I've been looking at compiler.py more and I think I see the problem you found.
2011-09-18T20:08:22  <McLeopold> but, I think the issue is with our jail users
2011-09-18T20:08:27  <ChrisH> I agree.
2011-09-18T20:08:51  <McLeopold> Is it possible we can setup ExternalCompiler with 2 commands separated by a semicolon?
2011-09-18T20:09:07  <ChrisH> I think the calls to check_path(vglob, cmd_errors) are looking in bot_dir instead of in the jail dir
2011-09-18T20:09:08  <McLeopold> we are passing is a list of tokens to _run_cmd
2011-09-18T20:09:15  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-18T20:09:25  <McLeopold> could be, but it works without the jail users
2011-09-18T20:09:27  <ChrisH> before the call to box.retrieve
2011-09-18T20:09:39  <McLeopold> or did it?
2011-09-18T20:09:51  <ChrisH> yes, because House just does it's work in bot_dir directly
2011-09-18T20:11:10  <McLeopold> so, the check_path could be with CD(bot_dir): check_path()
2011-09-18T20:11:15  <ChrisH> it is touchy though, because if ExternalCompiler is running with separate=True, then it is doing multiple commands in a for loop and checking the vglob after each, and I don't think you want to do a box.retrieve after each call
2011-09-18T20:11:57  <ChrisH> I think the check_path should be passed a directory to look in, and ExternalCompiler should get that directory from the sandbox root.
2011-09-18T20:12:10  <McLeopold> go would not use the separate flag
2011-09-18T20:12:30  <ChrisH> no it doesn't, so this only matters if another language starts using vglobs
2011-09-18T20:12:49  <McLeopold> btw, it stands for verify globs
2011-09-18T20:12:56  <ChrisH> ok,
2011-09-18T20:13:18  <ChrisH> But do you really need to do that check?
2011-09-18T20:13:39  <ChrisH> I mean, when the next call is made for the linker can't it just report a file not found error
2011-09-18T20:14:04  <McLeopold> I would want the stdout of the first command to be reported
2011-09-18T20:14:08  <ChrisH> so just take out the verify glob check and let the intermediate files get pulled back (if they exist) by box.retrieve
2011-09-18T20:14:17  <McLeopold> it has the info we really want to send to the user
2011-09-18T20:14:26  <ChrisH> fair enough
2011-09-18T20:14:52  <McLeopold> the vglobs was to prevent stdout from being captured unless we really knew we wanted it
2011-09-18T20:14:53  <ChrisH> in that case fix check_path to look in the jail root dir instead of the bot_dir
2011-09-18T20:15:16  <ChrisH> because the compiler is working in the jail root dir
2011-09-18T20:15:31  <McLeopold> that's what with CD() would do
2011-09-18T20:17:10  <ChrisH> but ExternalCompiler calls CD(bot_dir) and then uses _run_cmd() to spawn a subprocess in the jail dir, the child process doesn't affect the PWD of the parent, so I would think ExternalCompiler is still in bot_dir when it makes the call to check_path()
2011-09-18T20:18:58  <McLeopold> maybe sandbox could have a check_path?
2011-09-18T20:19:05  <ChrisH> Yes.
2011-09-18T20:19:10  <ChrisH> That should work.
2011-09-18T20:19:45  <ChrisH> There is a member of sandbox holding its working dir
2011-09-18T20:21:16  <ChrisH> Would it be easy for me to configure my Ubuntu to use the secure Jail implementation of sandbox to verify and fix this issue.
2011-09-18T20:21:20  <ChrisH> ?

2011-09-18T20:23:39  <McLeopold> janzert does the sandboxing, so he has to approve
2011-09-18T20:23:54  <ChrisH> I'm willing to do that, but I don't know what I would need to do to set up a proper test enivonment.

2011-09-18T20:43:25  <ChrisH> So, I have an edit to two python source files that I need to hand off to McLeopold.
2011-09-18T20:45:04  <ChrisH> McLeopold: it's going to take me some time to set up an Ubuntu 11 VM, do you think that is required, or would giving you my code changes be faster?

2011-09-18T20:46:42  <amstan> McLeopold: i could also solve it by deopping myself
2011-09-18T20:46:48  <McLeopold> ChrisH: fork the repo on github, then clone locally
2011-09-18T20:47:02  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Ok, sounds easy.
2011-09-18T20:47:04  <McLeopold> amstan: probably not worth changing now
2011-09-18T20:47:25  <McLeopold> or, setup contest bot to respond with "use ~" for a time
2011-09-18T20:47:42  <amstan> yeah, that's hard

2011-09-18T21:11:02  <McLeopold> I'm in the setup portion of ubuntu
2011-09-18T21:11:08  <janzert> worker_setup.py does not
2011-09-18T21:11:09  <amstan> McLeopold: i think you do, then sudo from inside the user when you start the install
2011-09-18T21:11:10  <McLeopold> setup_worker
2011-09-18T21:11:13  <ChrisH> So, I browse back to the main aichallenge project on github and do a pull request?
2011-09-18T21:11:29  <amstan> ChrisH: yes, something like that
2011-09-18T21:11:50  <amstan> ChrisH: i think you can do it from your repo actually
2011-09-18T21:11:57  <amstan> on top there should be a pull request button
2011-09-18T21:12:05  <ChrisH> yes, it looks like I have to
2011-09-18T21:12:34  <ChrisH> Ok, pull request submitted.
2011-09-18T21:12:47  <janzert> worker_setup.py expects to be run as root, but the contest user and the contest files should already be in place
2011-09-18T21:13:05  <McLeopold> contest files? you mean just cloning the repo?
2011-09-18T21:13:14  <McLeopold> or pulling the tarball
2011-09-18T21:13:15  <ChrisH> Now, let's hope it works.  :)
2011-09-18T21:13:41  <janzert> McLeopold: either would work
2011-09-18T21:14:00  <janzert> the actual workers pull and unpack the tarball
2011-09-18T21:14:10  <janzert> but that is just an exported repository
2011-09-18T21:14:15  <McLeopold> how do you setup a blank password?
2011-09-18T21:14:39  <janzert> adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" contest
2011-09-18T21:14:40  <McLeopold> is the tarball the whole thing, or just a piece?
2011-09-18T21:14:53  <janzert> the tarball is the whole repository
2011-09-18T21:15:24  <janzert> website/worker_init.py is the script that sets up the worker to the point of handing it over to setup/worker_setup.py
2011-09-18T21:15:50  <McLeopold> so I can curl | sh that?
2011-09-18T21:15:56  <janzert> basically all it does is create the contest user and grab and unpack the tarball
2011-09-18T21:16:04  <janzert> yes, you could
2011-09-18T21:16:15  <McLeopold> so, on ec2, you have the initial user called ubuntu?
2011-09-18T21:16:36  <janzert> that's the way the ubuntu images are setup, yes
2011-09-18T21:16:54  <amstan> janzert: hmm, is there no way to have common code for the 2 classes(House and Jail) merged? maybe make them inheret another class?
2011-09-18T21:16:55  <janzert> i.e. it's not something I configure
2011-09-18T21:17:19  <janzert> amstan: they used to but it was more of a mess
2011-09-18T21:17:36  <janzert> there isn't much duplicated code, just a common api
2011-09-18T21:19:04  <janzert> McLeopold: oh, worker_init.py expects the worker_api_key as an argument
2011-09-18T21:19:24  <McLeopold> amstan: how a about a base class that has a bunch of raise "Not Implemented" that they both inherited?
2011-09-18T21:19:38  <amstan> McLeopold: well, it's kinda late now, but i'm pondering
2011-09-18T21:19:41  <McLeopold> aka, python does not do abstract
2011-09-18T21:19:45  <janzert> McLeopold: why bother?
2011-09-18T21:19:56  <McLeopold> janzert: exactly
2011-09-18T21:20:05  <janzert> think of it as an example of duck typing
2011-09-18T21:20:40  <amstan> jbroman: to what extent does your zeta worker code cover what's done with the new epsilon worker?
2011-09-18T21:20:56  <McLeopold> is zeta been touched?
2011-09-18T21:20:59  <McLeopold> at all?
2011-09-18T21:21:10  <janzert> not since march
2011-09-18T21:21:23  <McLeopold> epsilon is the new beta
2011-09-18T21:21:24  <amstan> jbroman did some worker code on it
2011-09-18T21:21:25  <McLeopold> zeta
2011-09-18T21:21:30  <janzert> and really not since february
2011-09-18T21:21:49  <McLeopold> I think zeta should be an epsilon to django port, the worker stuff is solid
2011-09-18T21:22:25  <amstan> McLeopold: he seems to have documented it nicely too: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/zeta/worker
2011-09-18T21:24:09  <janzert> looks like what was used for planetwars?
2011-09-18T21:25:15  <janzert> i.e. it doesn't use a chroot root environment, just uses locked down users on the system
2011-09-18T21:25:41  <McLeopold> the s3 stuff might be nice
2011-09-18T21:25:49  <janzert> err, chroot sandbox environment
2011-09-18T21:26:13  <McLeopold> but then we don't need amazon if we don't want
2011-09-18T21:27:05  <amstan> McLeopold: how's your worker going? is it for testing Chris's stuff?
2011-09-18T21:27:10  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-18T21:27:11  <McLeopold> close
2011-09-18T21:28:02  <amstan> McLeopold: link if you need it: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/pull/254
2011-09-18T21:31:35  <janzert> how does the check_path(vglob stuff in ExternalCompiler ever work?
2011-09-18T21:32:12  <ChrisH> janzert: I believe never, but since it is only used by Go lang.... never means not for Go
2011-09-18T21:32:13  <janzert> it looks like it's checking for the vglobs in whatever directory the compiler is run from
2011-09-18T21:32:29  <jbroman> amstan: Haven't tried to integrate anything with epsilon.
2011-09-18T21:32:41  <McLeopold> somehow I got it to report the stdout errors, maybe I was tired
2011-09-18T21:32:42  <janzert> ChrisH: ahh, that would explain it
2011-09-18T21:32:45  <amstan> jbroman: i was just wondering how it compares
2011-09-18T21:32:59  <ChrisH> janzer: Well, it works in on a non-secured machine, because House works in the original directory
2011-09-18T21:33:14  <McLeopold> janzert: do I just make up an api key from the worker?
2011-09-18T21:33:20  <jbroman> Haven't touched zeta in quite a while, so it's state will be unchanged for some time, then may enter a state of rapid flux at some point.
2011-09-18T21:33:39  <janzert> If you're not ever connecting it to the beta server
2011-09-18T21:33:49  <McLeopold> but I am
2011-09-18T21:34:26  <janzert> what stage is your worker vm at?
2011-09-18T21:34:28  <McLeopold> pull the api_create_key from server_info.php?
2011-09-18T21:34:44  <McLeopold> contest user create, cloned repo, writing the worker_setup cmd
2011-09-18T21:34:49  <janzert> yes, that's the api_create_key though not the worker_api_key ;)
2011-09-18T21:34:59  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, and then put that into a get request to one of the php files
2011-09-18T21:35:18  <janzert> normally api_server_setup.php will create the worker api key
2011-09-18T21:35:23  <amstan> yes! that ^
2011-09-18T21:36:06  <janzert> so from the worker run curl 'http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/api_server_setup.php?api_create_key=<insert create key here>
2011-09-18T21:36:22  <McLeopold> but that's not in  worker_init.py?
2011-09-18T21:36:43  <janzert> that feeds you back worker_init.py with the api key
2011-09-18T21:36:59  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-18T21:37:08  <McLeopold> but I already created the contest user
2011-09-18T21:37:20  <janzert> specifically the ec2 instances start with "curl 'http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/api_server_setup.php?api_create_key=<create_key> | sh"
2011-09-18T21:37:41  <McLeopold> from the ubuntu user?
2011-09-18T21:37:48  <janzert> from root
2011-09-18T21:37:54  <janzert> but just a sec
2011-09-18T21:38:09  <janzert> since you already have the user and repository in place
2011-09-18T21:38:26  <janzert> just manually copy down the api key given to you by the above call
2011-09-18T21:40:12  <janzert> then from the setup directory run "./worker_setup.py -y --username contest --api-url http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com --api-key <api key you got> --install-cronjob --start"
2011-09-18T21:40:38  <janzert> oops that url needs a trailing slash I believe
2011-09-18T21:43:17  <McLeopold> and perhaps a sudo
2011-09-18T21:44:02  <janzert> sorry, thought I mentioned before it needed to be run as root
2011-09-18T21:44:53  <janzert> you might want also leave --start off the end
2011-09-18T21:45:07  <janzert> and may or may not want the --install-cronjob part as well
2011-09-18T22:01:57  <janzert> btw, so long as ChrisH changes actually work ;) they look fine to me
2011-09-18T22:02:53  <janzert> also ExternalCompiler.vglobs seems to be completely misnamed since I don't believe it can contain globs at all but must be actual file names

2011-09-18T22:20:41  <ChrisH> a glob is a wildcard pattern, like *.go.
2011-09-18T22:20:43  <janzert> *.jp
2011-09-18T22:20:47  <janzert> yes

2011-09-18T22:21:25  <McLeopold> well, I was close :)
2011-09-18T22:21:53  <McLeopold> my worker is still installing...
2011-09-18T22:22:14  <janzert> we support a lot of language :}
2011-09-18T22:23:24  <McLeopold> ec2 probably has faster network than me
2011-09-18T22:23:26  <ChrisH> yes, it's impressive
2011-09-18T22:23:43  <ChrisH> (# of langs that is)
2011-09-18T22:24:31  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah, ec2 sets up way faster than I can locally
2011-09-18T22:26:14  <janzert> hmm, beta server time is about 14 hours off?
2011-09-18T22:26:48  <janzert> suspiciously almost exactly 14 hours off
2011-09-18T22:27:18  <janzert> oh I guess not
2011-09-18T22:27:40  <janzert> it's just set to moscow daylight time?

2011-09-18T22:29:17  <McLeopold> it's in moscow?
2011-09-18T22:29:44  <McLeopold> where is demerzel from?
2011-09-18T22:30:10  <janzert> looks like it's hosted in an he.net datacenter
2011-09-18T22:30:28  <janzert> pretty sure they're chicago and maybe east coast
2011-09-18T22:31:19  <janzert> I thought it used to be set to central time, but I may not be remembering correctly
2011-09-18T22:38:16  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm, speaking of demerzel though any idea why he isn't getting any games since the ranking reset? other C# bots seem to be fine
2011-09-18T22:41:32  <janzert> looks like he's the seed in a matchup that has a NULL max_turns;
2011-09-18T22:44:30  <janzert> there are 5 matchups with null max_turns, guessing maybe they were stuck in the transition?
2011-09-18T22:48:23  <janzert> going to just update all null max_turns to 300
2011-09-18T22:51:31  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-18T22:54:35  <janzert> hmm, that doesn't seem to have unstuck them. What's the best way to just get rid of them?
2011-09-18T22:54:52  <McLeopold> matchups?
2011-09-18T22:54:58  <janzert> yes
2011-09-18T22:55:04  <McLeopold> well, i'd rather keep them and solve the problem
2011-09-18T22:55:45  <janzert> ok, 266777, 26670 and 266781 or just select * from matchup where worker_id = 0
2011-09-18T22:57:27  <McLeopold> do you know what that utf-8 error is?
2011-09-18T22:57:33  <janzert> looks like demerzel's the only seed of those three games that is still an active submisssion
2011-09-18T22:57:38  <janzert> no
2011-09-18T22:58:22  <McLeopold> i'll set the worker_id to null
2011-09-18T22:58:59  <janzert> hard to tell on most of those errors without a traceback
2011-09-18T22:59:17  <janzert> ahh, it needs a null worker_id to pick it up
2011-09-18T22:59:18  <McLeopold> yeah, I need to send them back
2011-09-18T22:59:21  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-18T22:59:30  <McLeopold> but it should not have set to zero...
2011-09-18T23:07:09  <ChrisH> McLeopold: is the test environment still configuring?
2011-09-18T23:09:24  <janzert> hmm, the worker shows that it got the matchup, ran it and reported the result but I don't see that on the server at all
2011-09-18T23:10:04  <McLeopold> matchup has errors
2011-09-18T23:10:19  <janzert> error is null
2011-09-18T23:10:31  <McLeopold> I see some NoneType errors
2011-09-18T23:10:33  <janzert> and no errors in the worker log
2011-09-18T23:10:45  <janzert> for matchup 266777 I mean
2011-09-18T23:11:12  <janzert> the other had the NoneType errors, I assume related to the seed no longer being an active submission
2011-09-18T23:11:39  <McLeopold> maybe we should report than nicely?  in get submission?
2011-09-18T23:11:57  <janzert> http://pastebin.com/CTSUtH88
2011-09-18T23:12:02  <janzert> relevant section of the worker log
2011-09-18T23:14:02  <janzert> that's just a guess on the NoneType error since there isn't anything in the worker log about it at all
2011-09-18T23:15:54  <McLeopold> the php_api.log shows handing out the task, but nothing after that
2011-09-18T23:16:00  <McLeopold> no response written
2011-09-18T23:16:18  <McLeopold> if the worker got the hash back, then api_game_result must have crashed
2011-09-18T23:16:52  <janzert> yeah, shows it as getting the hash back
2011-09-18T23:18:26  <McLeopold> php did crash
2011-09-18T23:18:37  <McLeopold> I must have another double $$
2011-09-18T23:19:38  <janzert> grep doesn't see it ;)
2011-09-18T23:20:57  <McLeopold> check ~/logs/error.log
2011-09-18T23:21:15  <McLeopold> the php error is at the end, and the time corresponds with matchup 266777
2011-09-18T23:21:33  <McLeopold> I should wrap phpshills in a try
2011-09-18T23:21:36  <janzert> it must have crashed before before line 138 since the matchup didn't get deleted

2011-09-18T23:25:54  <McLeopold> so, the stored procedure crashed?
2011-09-18T23:26:44  <janzert> maybe it was out of sync with the database schema for a little bit and couldn't handle the new max_turn fields?
2011-09-18T23:27:05  <janzert> although I don't know what in it would have been effected by that
2011-09-18T23:29:38  <McLeopold> so, let's ignore that one
2011-09-18T23:29:48  <McLeopold> although we should have failed earlier
2011-09-18T23:30:08  <janzert> ok :)
2011-09-18T23:30:08  <McLeopold> get_task can check for that and delete the matchup?
2011-09-18T23:30:21  <janzert> probably makes sense
2011-09-18T23:30:24  <McLeopold> I really need to get transactions working...
2011-09-18T23:30:31  <McLeopold> but php sucks
2011-09-18T23:31:58  <McLeopold> user 22, submission_id 1170 is causing the utf8 issues
2011-09-18T23:32:53  <McLeopold> the submission is active and playing games...
2011-09-18T23:33:35  <janzert> yep, the log on worker 203 has several games with it that appear normal
2011-09-18T23:34:56  <McLeopold> across 3 different maps, 3 different workers, that submission is the only constant
2011-09-18T23:35:44  <janzert> we need the worker to log a more detailed error when it sends an error back to the server

2011-09-18T23:58:44  <ChrisH> does this go code need to pass the bot validation, or just compile?

2011-09-18T23:59:52  <ChrisH> oh, ok then, that's what I would have sent anyway. :)
