2011-09-24T08:47:07  <dvladim> hi
2011-09-24T08:47:22  <dvladim> I suggest to change game specifications
2011-09-24T08:48:12  <dvladim> 1. The timeouted bots should receive scores if his ant kills the enemy ant
2011-09-24T08:48:51  <dvladim> 2. The quantity of ants should influence to total scores
2011-09-24T08:49:15  <dvladim> e.g. total score = score + k*ants
2011-09-24T08:51:51  <dvladim> where k = 2 - scores of killing one ant (at battle one against one)

2011-09-24T08:59:34  <dvladim> at k = 2 it will exclude tactics of end-games when ants enter battles one against one
2011-09-24T09:07:18  <dvladim> I want to exclude tactics of "stupid battles" at end-game, when bot rapidly increase scores at the expense of not necessary ants
2011-09-24T09:11:02  <delt0r> dvladim: Why?
2011-09-24T09:11:17  <delt0r> why do you want to exclude battles at the end
2011-09-24T09:11:29  <delt0r> I want to encourage them
2011-09-24T09:11:46  <delt0r> also if you time out i think you get no score.
2011-09-24T09:11:54  <delt0r> which is the way it should be
2011-09-24T09:13:40  <dvladim> if you time out - you easy opponent
2011-09-24T09:14:47  <dvladim> may be disqualified timeouted bots with no scores and last place?
2011-09-24T09:15:46  <delt0r> yea
2011-09-24T09:16:07  <delt0r> you timed out or crashed... you quit --you get zero score
2011-09-24T09:16:11  <delt0r> or you should
2011-09-24T09:16:20  <delt0r> you are last... and a loser! :)
2011-09-24T09:16:53  <delt0r> you don't get a "winning at the time they gave up in Marathon" medal
2011-09-24T09:17:43  <delt0r> as for this adjusting score so x y and z don't happen... i have yet to hear why z y or z shouldn't happen...
2011-09-24T09:17:56  <dvladim> If the boat is disqualified his ants should are removed from a map
2011-09-24T09:18:04  <delt0r> seriously... why should there not be epic battles at the end?
2011-09-24T09:18:32  <dvladim> i say "stupid battles"
2011-09-24T09:18:37  <delt0r> dvladim: they because NPC much like quite a few other games in fact... i think its a good  trade off
2011-09-24T09:19:06  <delt0r> So why are they stupid? why should we discorade battle at the end?
2011-09-24T09:19:15  <delt0r> discourage
2011-09-24T09:19:30  <delt0r> why have battles at all?
2011-09-24T09:19:40  <delt0r> if they are stupid
2011-09-24T09:20:07  <dvladim> in this game at the end FlagCapeer with 15 ants potentialy has weak position
2011-09-24T09:20:09  <delt0r> and if they are not stupid at one point in the game, what makes them stupid at a different time in the game
2011-09-24T09:20:31  <delt0r> *potentially* being the key work
2011-09-24T09:20:33  <delt0r> word

2011-09-24T09:25:17  <dvladim> quantity of ants at end-game it doesn't matter
2011-09-24T09:25:51  <dvladim> It is not necessary to protect ants
2011-09-24T09:25:59  <delt0r> score does...
2011-09-24T09:26:16  <delt0r> every ant needlessly lost is points someone else gets
2011-09-24T09:26:43  <dvladim> It is better to lose ants, but to receive scores
2011-09-24T09:27:01  <delt0r> it is better to maximize your score gain
2011-09-24T09:27:15  <delt0r> you can't do that without some ant to use...
2011-09-24T09:27:28  <delt0r> its not a given that "just let em all die" will work
2011-09-24T09:28:04  <delt0r> in fact it is trivial to show that in  2 player game this is useless... you must kill more than you lose if you want to gain anything
2011-09-24T09:28:17  <dvladim> Yes, therefore the quantity of ants should influence quantity of scores
2011-09-24T09:29:05  <delt0r> It does! you get a point for each one spawned ..
2011-09-24T09:29:38  <dvladim> no, quantity of ants at endgame
2011-09-24T09:30:01  <dvladim> should influence to scores
2011-09-24T09:30:13  <delt0r> its mathematically the same as give a -1 to each ant you lose
2011-09-24T09:30:17  <delt0r> nothing more
2011-09-24T09:30:37  <delt0r> and no--if we do that then just keep it at "the most ants at the end wins"
2011-09-24T09:30:51  <delt0r> which will result in nothing more than harvest fests
2011-09-24T09:30:58  <delt0r> aka why keep battles at all
2011-09-24T09:31:45  <delt0r> you this has been trashed out for many months

2011-09-24T09:35:36  <UncleVasya> Also a bot with bigger ants amount with right battle resolution will not give his loosing opponent an opportunity to kill ants without losses.
2011-09-24T09:36:55  <delt0r> basically if you don't have the most ants close to end game, and your == matched bots, you have a very good chance of getting first
2011-09-24T09:37:01  <delt0r> sorry
2011-09-24T09:37:13  <delt0r> very good chance of losing
2011-09-24T09:38:16  <UncleVasya> From another point, if loosing in quantity bot can fight well enough to kill another bot's ants without losses so this is the problem of that bot.

2011-09-24T09:51:39  <gattschardo> i'm still working on the erlang starter package and i keep getting timeouts
2011-09-24T09:51:59  <gattschardo> i cloned the git repo though, and my bot runs through the test_bot.sh script just fine
2011-09-24T09:52:05  <McLeopold> gattschardo: test_bot.sh
2011-09-24T09:52:14  <McLeopold> I might be able to help you, hold on

2011-09-24T10:09:38  <_flag> xathis: Probably not today. I may try setting it up on a seperate computer, I'm just a little scared that there may be some possible security bugs still around
2011-09-24T10:09:58  <_flag> Anyone can set it up though
2011-09-24T10:10:49  <_flag> It's fairly easy, all you have to do is run main.py and forward ports 2080 and 2081 in your router to your computer

2011-09-24T10:11:57  <xathis> is the security issue from yesterday fixed on github?

2011-09-24T10:14:39  <gattschardo> i think i must've messed something up in compiler.py, because everything else works, locally
2011-09-24T10:17:46  <McLeopold> gattschardo: is this the starter_bot?
2011-09-24T10:18:25  <gattschardo> what, this?
2011-09-24T10:18:51  <gattschardo> i upload the stuff to the beta server as 'ydinic'
2011-09-24T10:18:57  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-24T10:20:07  <gattschardo> there should be ants, map and my_bot, a .erl and a .beam of each, after successful compile (works locally, but i really don't know...)
2011-09-24T10:20:19  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-24T10:35:01  <gattschardo> also, could you run "erl -noshell -s init stop" on the server where the code runs and tell me whether it prints anything to stdout or stderr (it should not)
2011-09-24T10:43:11  * gattschardo is going for a walk with the dog
2011-09-24T10:43:12  <gattschardo> bbl
2011-09-24T10:54:05  <McLeopold> gattschardo: you are writing to stderr, but you must not be properly flushing it.
2011-09-24T10:54:25  <McLeopold> gattschardo: I can update a bot that times out with an error message and the server captures it
2011-09-24T10:55:23  <McLeopold> gattschardo: {"init terminating in do_boot",{undef,[{my_bot,start,[]},{init,start_it,1},{init,start_em,1}]}} Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump init terminating in do_boot ()
2011-09-24T10:56:41  <UncleVasya> Hi McLeopold. Are you allow bot to kill his ants by moving them to one cell? It was an incorrect order earlier.
2011-09-24T10:57:26  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-24T10:57:38  <McLeopold> if you step on your own ant, they both die
2011-09-24T10:57:44  <McLeopold> but there is no score

2011-09-24T13:38:01  <mcstar> soon to be clojure user
2011-09-24T13:38:19  <mcstar> i think that is what everybody uses
2011-09-24T13:38:42  <mcstar> i guess 1.2.1 is the prev. one right?
2011-09-24T13:38:44  <janzert> well it was just released 19 hours ago
2011-09-24T13:38:56  <mcstar> well, 1.3 is available for quite some time
2011-09-24T13:39:07  <mcstar> it is called master snapshot
2011-09-24T13:39:08  <janzert> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/w5Nmx5rPaQs
2011-09-24T13:39:46  <janzert> yes but not the actual release though :}
2011-09-24T13:40:04  <mcstar> yeah, i guess it was beta then
2011-09-24T13:40:44  <mcstar> is the jvm ver 6 or ver 7?
2011-09-24T13:41:16  <mcstar> i installed 7 for myself, seems to work with it
2011-09-24T13:41:25  <janzert> pretty sure it's 6
2011-09-24T13:41:32  * mcstar isnt sure whats the difference of the 2 versions though
2011-09-24T13:41:37  <janzert> whatever comes in ubuntu 11.04 natty
2011-09-24T13:42:06  <janzert> and jdk7 didn't come out till after that I'm pretty sure
2011-09-24T13:43:56  <mcstar> i guess java has the biggest startup delay of all the languages, right?

2011-09-24T13:44:29  <janzert> that would be my guess as well, but I don't have any real measurements
2011-09-24T13:44:55  <mcstar> must take some time to start a game with 8 players all of java :)
2011-09-24T13:45:30  <janzert> ignoring of course that languages on top of the JVM will pretty much by definition be longer than straight java (e.g. clojure and scala)
2011-09-24T13:46:44  <mcstar> i dont know, does starting the jvm and starting a java app take the same time?
2011-09-24T13:47:38  <mcstar> (im a nub regarding java, i can imagine that a clean jvm, is not the same as a full java runtime)
2011-09-24T13:48:01  <jbroman> mcstar: AFAIK, the Java runtime is pretty much just the JVM.
2011-09-24T13:48:26  <mcstar> aham, so all the jvm languages are written explicitely in java
2011-09-24T13:48:46  <janzert> well, they compile down to the same bytecode
2011-09-24T13:48:47  <jbroman> mcstar: Not necessarily, but they're compiled down to Java bytecode.
2011-09-24T13:48:54  <janzert> I think some use self hosting compilers
2011-09-24T13:49:18  <mcstar> that is neat :)
2011-09-24T13:49:19  <jbroman> But Java doesn't need much of a runtime.
2011-09-24T13:49:25  <jbroman> (beyond JVM facilities)
2011-09-24T13:50:19  <janzert> yeah, the JVM and Java were built to fit together quite tightly, all the other languages have an 'impedance' mismatch to some extent or another
2011-09-24T13:50:32  <jbroman> Though things like invokedynamic are making it better.
2011-09-24T13:50:45  <janzert> although JDK7 has features meant to help it... yes
2011-09-24T13:51:14  <jbroman> But yeah, the semantics of the native JVM types match the basic Java types pretty closely.

2011-09-24T13:53:17  <jbroman> mcstar: What do you mean by scripting? (The term is so overloaded nowadays.)

2011-09-24T13:53:51  <mcstar> i mean the usual linux/unix scripting way
2011-09-24T13:53:56  <jbroman> Do you mean as a drop-in for a Perl script (typically short-lived code that executes for a short amount of time then terminates, and is developed similarly quickly)?
2011-09-24T13:54:07  <mcstar> couple hunderd lines tops
2011-09-24T13:54:24  <mcstar> like using bash commands, you know
2011-09-24T13:54:42  <mcstar> one program for one purpose, can get invoked many times
2011-09-24T13:54:49  <mcstar> and terminates fast
2011-09-24T13:55:07  <mcstar> i dont know perl
2011-09-24T13:55:13  <mcstar> but lets say python
2011-09-24T13:55:21  <jbroman> So you're referring to the startup time of the JVM.
2011-09-24T13:55:28  <mcstar> yeah, thats a bummer
2011-09-24T13:55:41  <mcstar> i cant imagine doing "scripting" in clojure
2011-09-24T13:55:48  <mcstar> but i can do it in sbcl
2011-09-24T13:56:14  <mcstar> (actually, that has a pretty long startup time already)
2011-09-24T13:56:30  <jbroman> A lot of it is disk IO reading in the standard library classes.
2011-09-24T13:56:38  <mcstar> i heard that before
2011-09-24T13:56:41  <jbroman> This is why Java shipped with the oh-so-unpopular "quick starter".
2011-09-24T13:56:53  <jbroman> Which more or less loads them into memory and sits there, so they're loaded out of cache next time.
2011-09-24T13:57:17  <mcstar> but why is that? java isnt that modular as python?
2011-09-24T13:57:20  <mcstar> or what?
2011-09-24T13:57:32  <mcstar> i guess python is not a bit less "frameworked"
2011-09-24T13:57:47  <mcstar> (bad term, i mean it has the same functionality, doesnt it?)
2011-09-24T13:58:24  <jbroman> My understanding of the comparative startup procedure of the two VMs isn't good enough to give a satisfactory answer to that.
2011-09-24T13:58:54  <mcstar> jbroman: does java load everything it has?
2011-09-24T13:59:06  <mcstar> it must have a module system too
2011-09-24T13:59:17  <mcstar> or namespace or package i dont know what it is called
2011-09-24T13:59:29  <jbroman> mcstar: It is modular (packages, classes, etc), but a number of classes must be initialized at startup.
2011-09-24T13:59:41  <jbroman> (The string, much of java.lang, etc.)
2011-09-24T13:59:53  <jbroman> I read an article on this at some point but cannot find it right now.
2011-09-24T14:00:56  <mcstar> what always surprised me, is that java runs on mobile devices, so they must have a lot of experience dumbing things down, fitting things in less memory, disk, time whatever, yet its the slowest starting vm for a pc
2011-09-24T14:01:49  <jbroman> mcstar: It does get quite efficient once running, though, and for many of Java's applications this is a good tradeoff.
2011-09-24T14:04:05  <jbroman> I mean, for a small application the startup time is quite sub-second.
2011-09-24T14:04:19  <jbroman> (With the client JVM, not the server one.)
2011-09-24T14:04:32  <jbroman> Though -server is comparable.
2011-09-24T14:04:43  <mcstar> how do you do that?
2011-09-24T14:04:48  <jbroman> Do what?
2011-09-24T14:04:52  <mcstar> launch a server process of java?
2011-09-24T14:04:58  <mcstar> and let scripts use that?
2011-09-24T14:05:09  <jbroman> That is a misleading name, I'll admit.
2011-09-24T14:05:17  <jbroman> "java -server" launches the HotSpot Server VM.
2011-09-24T14:05:24  <jbroman> Which is a version of the JVM intended for use on servers.
2011-09-24T14:07:30  <mcstar> is that a launch once, reuse many times version?
2011-09-24T14:07:40  <mcstar> or no
2011-09-24T14:07:51  <jbroman> No, it's still an independent JVM.
2011-09-24T14:08:03  <jbroman> Just one with different performance characteristics.
2011-09-24T14:08:12  <mcstar> so you are saying it just takes less time to start?
2011-09-24T14:08:14  <mcstar> aha
2011-09-24T14:08:27  <mcstar> i just tried it, and it took the same time
2011-09-24T14:08:29  <jbroman> I think it takes more, actually. But does more aggressive optimization in some cases.
2011-09-24T14:08:36  <mcstar> i think im missing something here..
2011-09-24T14:08:40  <jbroman> As I said, intended for long-running processes.
2011-09-24T14:08:47  <jbroman> Though you could probably construct such a Java process if you wanted.
2011-09-24T14:09:00  <jbroman> Would be pretty hacky though; you'd have to hook all over the place.
2011-09-24T14:09:17  <mcstar> jbroman: i think i simply misunderstood your sentence: I mean, for a small application the startup time is quite sub-second.
2011-09-24T14:09:56  <jbroman> Oh, sorry. I just meant that starting a small Java application doesn't take very long.
2011-09-24T14:10:26  <mcstar> starting clojure takes 10 sec real time, 18 user time for either
2011-09-24T14:10:59  <jbroman> Wait, really?
2011-09-24T14:11:12  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-24T14:11:15  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-24T14:11:47  <mcstar> im not sure how much is the clojure part, but i dont think its too much, its a 2-3MB file
2011-09-24T14:12:21  <jbroman> I can start the Clojure interpreter in far, far less than that, so that large a time surprises me.
2011-09-24T14:12:41  <mcstar> then help me out
2011-09-24T14:12:46  <mcstar> what am i doing wrong?
2011-09-24T14:12:57  <jbroman> I really know even less about Clojure than Java. :P
2011-09-24T14:14:23  <jbroman> mcstar: Anyhow, I just stumbled upon this. May suck, but still you might be interested: https://github.com/Neronus/clj-server
2011-09-24T14:14:26  <mcstar> jbroman: you can start it in less time than me, so you seem to know it a hell lot better
2011-09-24T14:14:41  <jbroman> mcstar: I just apt-get installed it and ran it?
2011-09-24T14:15:08  <mcstar> how do you start it?
2011-09-24T14:15:19  <jbroman> mcstar: "clojure"?
2011-09-24T14:15:46  <mcstar> i think i can get a pre-made script,to look at it

2011-09-24T14:16:53  <mcstar> jbroman: how can i start something else with java?
2011-09-24T14:17:02  <mcstar> some other jar file
2011-09-24T14:17:12  <mcstar> i dont have anyhting, recommend me something
2011-09-24T14:17:21  <jbroman> "something"?
2011-09-24T14:17:27  <mcstar> yeah
2011-09-24T14:17:28  <jbroman> I was just running a hello world app.
2011-09-24T14:17:37  <mcstar> java hello world?
2011-09-24T14:17:44  <mcstar> i want to skip clojure
2011-09-24T14:17:52  <jbroman> Hold, I'll paste it.
2011-09-24T14:18:44  <jbroman> https://gist.github.com/1239662
2011-09-24T14:18:59  <jbroman> Save as HelloWorld.java, run "javac HelloWorld.java" to compile, then "java HelloWorld" to run.
2011-09-24T14:19:12  <mcstar> k
2011-09-24T14:19:33  <jbroman> I get about 0.4 seconds to run the Java hello world, 1.0 seconds to run the Clojure equivalent.

2011-09-24T14:20:52  <mcstar> sys0m0.037s
2011-09-24T14:21:14  <mcstar> this is interesting
2011-09-24T14:21:38  <mcstar> so when i run this with "java" the hotspot just starts up
2011-09-24T14:21:48  <mcstar> then its pretty fast
2011-09-24T14:22:34  <jbroman> Actually, I ran Java on a different machine. Actual Java runtime for me is 0.08 s.
2011-09-24T14:23:05  <jbroman> It's related to the complexity of your app, though.
2011-09-24T14:23:38  <jbroman> If your app is one class, linked to a bit of java.io and not much else, it's pretty fast. I think it loads your dependencies pretty aggressively at startup, though.
2011-09-24T14:24:06  <mcstar> ok, so what is youre clojure equivalent?
2011-09-24T14:24:28  <mcstar> when i used the above java -cp invokation, it brings up the repl
2011-09-24T14:24:39  <jbroman> Probably a cleaner way of doing it, but for equivalency, I put this in HelloWorld.clj:
2011-09-24T14:24:40  <jbroman> (. (. System out) println "Hello world")
2011-09-24T14:24:43  <mcstar> so i guess you mean, you run a clojure script with it, without interactivity
2011-09-24T14:24:51  <jbroman> And then java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main HelloWorld.clj
2011-09-24T14:25:58  <jbroman> I think you can compile Clojure, though, which would be more fair if possible.

2011-09-24T14:30:25  <jbroman> ibdknox: See, I knew there would be a function in global scope that would do it.
2011-09-24T14:30:51  <jbroman> No effect on startup time, though. :)
2011-09-24T14:30:59  <ibdknox> no haha
2011-09-24T14:31:24  <ibdknox> What are you guys trying to figure out?
2011-09-24T14:31:41  <jbroman> ibdknox: mcstar wants to know why Clojure takes 10 seconds to start for him.
2011-09-24T14:31:56  <jbroman> I imagine it's disk I/O speed, maybe CPU speed, but I'm surprised its 10x slower than what I'm seeing.

2011-09-24T14:32:14  <mcstar> i downloaded the 1.3.0 release
2011-09-24T14:32:28  <mcstar> the previous times were for 1.3.0-master-SNAPSHOT
2011-09-24T14:32:41  <janzert> jbroman: are you measuring already warmed up disk caches possibly?
2011-09-24T14:32:43  <mcstar> jbroman: are those comparable to yours?
2011-09-24T14:32:58  <jbroman> mcstar: I got about 1 second real. So close enough.
2011-09-24T14:33:10  <jbroman> janzert: Well, sure, but mcstar has run it enough times that it ought to be in his cache now, too.
2011-09-24T14:33:27  <mcstar> yeah, i guess my caches are warm, only my feet are cold
2011-09-24T14:33:54  <mcstar> ibdknox: hi, seems that im ready to join the cult of hickey
2011-09-24T14:34:03  <ibdknox> mcstar: excellent
2011-09-24T14:34:30  <ibdknox> mcstar: use leiningen to run clojure, it'll make your life much happier
2011-09-24T14:34:36  <mcstar> i have it
2011-09-24T14:34:40  <ibdknox> good deal
2011-09-24T14:34:46  <mcstar> it just took soo long to start up
2011-09-24T14:34:54  <ibdknox> you can use cake if you want
2011-09-24T14:34:59  <ibdknox> that gives you a persistent JVM
2011-09-24T14:35:24  <jbroman> ibdknox: Awesome, eminently ungoogleable name.
2011-09-24T14:35:24  <mcstar> im using slime with clojure-jack-in
2011-09-24T14:35:38  <jbroman> ibdknox: Tried "cake", then "java cake", then finally "java cake jvm".
2011-09-24T14:36:10  <janzert> ibdknox: have any advantages or disadvantages for the contest moving to clojure 1.3?
2011-09-24T14:36:10  <jbroman> Perhaps "clojure cake" would've worked better.
2011-09-24T14:36:16  <ibdknox> https://github.com/flatland/cake
2011-09-24T14:36:17  <mcstar> clojure cake first hit
2011-09-24T14:36:34  <ibdknox> janzert: shouldn't really make a difference
2011-09-24T14:37:01  <ibdknox> janzert: maybe if you rely really heavily on very large number computation
2011-09-24T14:37:02  <ibdknox> lol
2011-09-24T14:37:11  <janzert> :)
2011-09-24T14:37:29  <ibdknox> otherwise it's marginal speed gains
2011-09-24T14:37:36  <mcstar> ibdknox: seems to be exactly liek leininggen
2011-09-24T14:37:43  <ibdknox> mcstar: it is
2011-09-24T14:37:54  <ibdknox> mcstar: the difference is the use of a persistent JVM
2011-09-24T14:37:56  <janzert> from my perspective I'd rather leave it alone and not make any change but at the same time I don't know if I'm going to listen to complaints about using such an old version for the whole contest :P
2011-09-24T14:38:03  <ibdknox> mcstar: and slightly different commands
2011-09-24T14:38:29  <ibdknox> janzert: there shouldn't be a downside to using Clojure 1.3
2011-09-24T14:38:57  <mcstar> but theres a 4x upside
2011-09-24T14:39:06  <mcstar> for me at least
2011-09-24T14:39:31  <janzert> the downside from my perspective is that I need to make a change to make it happen (and I'll probably break it twice in the process) ;)
2011-09-24T14:39:38  <ibdknox> lol
2011-09-24T14:39:38  <mcstar> ibdknox: just to feed my curiosity, what is your clojure startup time?
2011-09-24T14:40:24  <ibdknox> leiningen start time is about 2s, but that's because lein goes and loads a bunch of stuff dynamically to allow for plugins
2011-09-24T14:41:44  <mcstar> thats 4.1sec with 1.3.0
2011-09-24T14:41:50  <mcstar> i guess it is using that one
2011-09-24T14:42:03  <ibdknox> by default lein still uses 1.2.1
2011-09-24T14:43:26  <ibdknox> running 1.3.0 without lein I get slightly less than 1s
2011-09-24T14:43:27  <mcstar> ok, well a clean load of the clojure.jar is 2.6 sec
2011-09-24T14:43:46  <mcstar> that is 4 times better than the previous so im satisfied for the time being
2011-09-24T14:44:06  <ibdknox> mcstar: you won't need to restart often
2011-09-24T14:45:28  <ibdknox> the simples test is java -cp clojure-1.3.0.jar clojure.main '(println "hello world")'
2011-09-24T14:45:31  <mcstar> ibdknox: jbroman said clojure files can be compiled? how?
2011-09-24T14:45:45  <ibdknox> you can AoT compile them using lein
2011-09-24T14:46:04  <ibdknox> anytime lein runs, it will also generate classfiles for you
2011-09-24T14:46:32  <mcstar> Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException: (println "hello world") (No such file or directory)
2011-09-24T14:46:39  <ibdknox> whoops
2011-09-24T14:46:51  <ibdknox> java -cp clojure-1.3.0.jar clojure.main -e '(println "hello world")'
2011-09-24T14:47:14  <mcstar> 1.7 sec
2011-09-24T14:50:22  <ibdknox> janzert: if you do switch to 1.3.0, let me know, I'll need to make two small changes to the starter bot
2011-09-24T14:52:59  <mcstar> omg, my pc got infested with some virus

2011-09-24T15:11:59  <mcstar> of course cake is fast, its written in ruby
2011-09-24T15:12:42  <jbroman> mcstar: Different cake, I think.
2011-09-24T15:12:52  <mcstar> no
2011-09-24T15:13:00  <mcstar> the main script is in ruby
2011-09-24T15:13:10  <jbroman> Oh, that.
2011-09-24T15:13:37  <jbroman> That would make sense for the startup time. :P
2011-09-24T15:15:45  <mcstar> and its really fast, to start the repl for example
2011-09-24T15:15:53  <mcstar> it uses -server mode
2011-09-24T15:16:00  <ibdknox> that's because it only starts the JVM once
2011-09-24T15:16:08  <mcstar> yes, just as you told

2011-09-24T15:28:57  <cichociemno> I have that strange problem last time that my bot was not passing test. Now I know what was the reason. Seed for random number generator was to large for int. It would be cool if the input for bots could be more precisely specified.
2011-09-24T15:29:05  <mcstar> ibdknox: can i nag you some more?
2011-09-24T15:31:05  <ibdknox> mcstar: sup?
2011-09-24T15:31:44  <mcstar> is 1.3.2 the latest swank-clojure?
2011-09-24T15:31:59  <mcstar> because when i connect from slime, it says its from 20100404
2011-09-24T15:32:55  <mcstar> first i thought lein didnt use this swank, but cake now downloaded this one, and it seems odd, that everywhere i look, they say "download sawnk-clojure 1.3.2"
2011-09-24T15:32:57  <ibdknox> are you using clojure-jack-in?
2011-09-24T15:32:59  <mcstar> its quite outsated

2011-09-24T15:33:37  <ibdknox> but I'm not the best person to ask
2011-09-24T15:33:50  <mcstar> at least i need to supress that warning
2011-09-24T15:33:58  <ibdknox> I use VIM

2011-09-24T15:36:06  <mcstar> one problem was with gvim, is that it cant create multiple windows

2011-09-24T15:37:46  <mcstar> yes, and im annoyed by the modal editing too
2011-09-24T15:38:01  <mcstar> i felt myself uncomfortable with it all the time
2011-09-24T15:38:36  <jbroman> It's certainly different. I've gotten used to it.
2011-09-24T15:38:36  <mcstar> i accept if some people find that natural, i think i just dont
2011-09-24T15:38:50  <jbroman> I don't think anyone is born used to it, though.
2011-09-24T15:39:26  <mcstar> i was about to read a big article on vim scripting, when i met emacs, so ive never gotten to read it

2011-09-24T16:01:59  <mcstar> its really nice that one can use recur with pure-functions
2011-09-24T16:06:44  <ibdknox> you should almost never use recur though :)
2011-09-24T16:06:52  <ibdknox> you can do all of these with higher-order functions
2011-09-24T16:10:02  <mcstar> really?
2011-09-24T16:10:27  <mcstar> i thought recur is there because theres no tail-recursion in java
2011-09-24T16:10:41  <mcstar> so that the code becomes efficient, and its basically a loop
2011-09-24T16:10:51  <ibdknox> it is
2011-09-24T16:11:09  <ibdknox> but you don't need recursion in Clojure as much as you'd think
2011-09-24T16:12:25  <mcstar> ok, well i dont know how to do that example in a more functional way
2011-09-24T16:12:51  <mcstar> and it seems that site doesnt show you the best solutions
2011-09-24T16:12:56  <mcstar> which it should i think

2011-09-24T16:14:09  <janzert> ibdknox: I don't really know clojure or exactly what the functions are supposed to do but the definitions of passable and valid-move seem reversed?
2011-09-24T16:16:45  <janzert> or I guess not
2011-09-24T16:17:17  <mcstar> passable is ok

2011-09-24T16:18:19  <janzert> neither function is doing what I initially thought :}
2011-09-24T16:18:24  <mcstar> theres no valid-move
2011-09-24T16:18:35  <mcstar> but i found a can-move?

2011-09-24T16:18:40  <ibdknox> I changed it
2011-09-24T16:18:44  <ibdknox> the name is better

2011-09-24T16:20:52  <mcstar> the numbers come as the arguemnts of the function

2011-09-24T16:22:30  <janzert> i.e. is there some magic going on or is it doing a full sort then grabbing the largest value
2011-09-24T16:22:39  <mcstar> anyway, i dont think i'd every use sort to get an extremum of a set
2011-09-24T16:22:55  <mcstar> no magic i think
2011-09-24T16:23:01  <mcstar> its just short
2011-09-24T16:23:08  <janzert> ok
2011-09-24T16:23:11  <ibdknox> yeah :)
2011-09-24T16:23:26  <ibdknox> there are lazy sorts that are very magical
2011-09-24T16:23:31  <ibdknox> I don't think the built in sort is though
2011-09-24T16:23:40  * janzert nods
2011-09-24T16:24:02  <mcstar> ibdknox: are you doing cuncurrent stuff in it?

2011-09-24T16:26:20  <mcstar> seems he suffered a thread deadlock
2011-09-24T16:26:30  <ibdknox> mcstar: I do all my work in Clojure these days :)
2011-09-24T16:26:47  <mcstar> which includes concurrency?
2011-09-24T16:26:54  <ibdknox> indeed
2011-09-24T16:27:09  <mcstar> what really got my attention, is the agent system
2011-09-24T16:27:28  <mcstar> now this may sound stupid, but id like to use it to build an AI agent system
2011-09-24T16:28:10  <mcstar> im starting to realize, that the clojure agent system is a way to modify references atomically
2011-09-24T16:28:23  <mcstar> or transactionally
2011-09-24T16:29:07  <mcstar> do you think it is pausible to write the ai stuff with it? id like to get these ai agents to concurrently communicate with each other
2011-09-24T16:29:28  <mcstar> (i dont mean real multi-threaded concurrency, of course)
2011-09-24T16:29:55  <ibdknox> that's what agents were designed for
2011-09-24T16:30:06  <mcstar> so my question is i think, do you think that this system is better suited for the task, than for example to use an object oriented framewrok?
2011-09-24T16:30:13  <ibdknox> yes
2011-09-24T16:30:45  <ibdknox> building a game is the one place I think Clojure is a little weird
2011-09-24T16:30:59  <mcstar> how so?
2011-09-24T16:31:04  <mcstar> and what kind of game?
2011-09-24T16:31:26  <ibdknox> any kind really
2011-09-24T16:31:29  <ibdknox> there's so much state
2011-09-24T16:31:44  <ibdknox> I don't find functional programming lends itself to games very well
2011-09-24T16:31:47  <ibdknox> some concepts do
2011-09-24T16:31:48  <ibdknox> others don't
2011-09-24T16:33:07  <mcstar> and do you find clojure's approach to concurrency satisfactory? for example i can imagine that other problems than locking can cause equally big practical problems
2011-09-24T16:33:57  <ibdknox> it works great. Immutability makes most of the issues go away
2011-09-24T16:34:09  <ibdknox> being very explicit about state handles the majority of the rest
2011-09-24T16:35:14  <mcstar> so you dont find yourself thinking hours on a problem, that could have been solved the old fashioned way easily?
2011-09-24T16:36:24  <ibdknox> when I first learned, sure
2011-09-24T16:36:25  <ibdknox> now? no
2011-09-24T16:37:35  <mcstar> "first" learned? does that imply you learned clojure multiple times?
2011-09-24T16:37:37  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-24T16:37:53  <ibdknox> lol
