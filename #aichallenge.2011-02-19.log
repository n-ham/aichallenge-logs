2011-02-19T07:11:50  <antimatroid1> i might look into that now

2011-02-19T07:31:07  <Frontier> *versions
2011-02-19T07:31:16  <antimatroid1> was it good was it? :P
2011-02-19T07:31:19  <antimatroid1> i haven't looked
2011-02-19T07:31:28  <antimatroid1> i will when there's a link i can click to watch a game
2011-02-19T07:33:04  * antimatroid1 wonders what the server time is 
2011-02-19T07:33:08  <Frontier> From what I can see it parses the adress bar. So you can drop the visualizer into some web server and whatch it play
2011-02-19T07:33:33  <Frontier> Let me see if I can do that.

2011-02-19T09:41:30  <Frontier> wow, someone wrote a lzma codec in javascript. so we could store lzma compressed replays on the server and have them decompressed by the client. On the other hand it might just not be worth the server cpu time :)

2011-02-19T10:13:01  <janzert> antimatroid: after just a quick skim I think the pairing can be phrased as a minimum weight perfect matching problem which can be done in polynomial time (there are even a couple open source implementations out there)
2011-02-19T10:14:30  <antimatroid> janzert: i'll have a look, thanks
2011-02-19T10:19:41  <Frontier> janzert: btw, I found it is an option to store the replays in compressed format on the server and decode them within javascript. there are implementations for anything from gzip to lzma.
2011-02-19T10:20:04  <janzert> ahh, that'd be great.
2011-02-19T10:20:04  <Frontier> it's usefulness depends though as you can imagine
2011-02-19T10:20:58  <janzert> I wonder if we can't store them gzip'ed and then server them with the correct headers so the browser will decompress before handing it off to the javascript
2011-02-19T10:21:20  <janzert> I'm pretty sure all the modern browsers support gzip compression
2011-02-19T10:21:23  <antimatroid> hmmm this golfing problem is hard
2011-02-19T10:21:32  <Frontier> this is one of the 'dependencies' i can imagine
2011-02-19T10:22:49  <Frontier> It might also be the case that only a few replays are actually watched so the cpu load for compressing all of them in advance would be higher than on-the-fly gzip compression
2011-02-19T10:23:38  <janzert> except I was wanting the compression to save on storage space more than bandwidth space
2011-02-19T10:24:42  <Frontier> then take a look at this: http://nmrugg.github.com/LZMA-JS/LZMA-JS_demo_simple/LZMADemo_simple.html
2011-02-19T10:25:40  <janzert> also since amazon just changed it so you can serve content directly from S3 now, we could just store the replay data in S3 and not worry about it
2011-02-19T10:25:46  <Frontier> (most of the time is actually consumed by the dynamic HTML part if I can trust Chrome's profiler)
2011-02-19T10:26:27  <Frontier> don't we run into the cross-site-scipting problem again then?
2011-02-19T10:27:30  <Frontier> or do you imagine a php script to load the replay data from this S3 server and merge it into a html on ai-contest.com?
2011-02-19T10:27:31  <janzert> I think the visualizer would have to be served from S3 as well for it to work, yeah
2011-02-19T10:27:37  <Frontier> ah ok
2011-02-19T10:28:37  <Frontier> (the php version would defeat the purpose, i should think before i type :p)
2011-02-19T10:29:33  <janzert> the php version would still have some potential advantage but yeah it wouldn't be as nice

2011-02-19T11:36:26  <antimatroid> another few quibbles... does the visualiser window thing (black box) need to be square? given we're doing up to n-players, are wanting to do large maps and most screens aren't square, i was thinking it might be better to allow the width to be greater than the height of a map at the upper bound
2011-02-19T11:36:55  <antimatroid> i think that was my main quibble
2011-02-19T11:37:13  <antimatroid> i'll worry about the most aesthetically pleasing colours later, maybe lighter blue for water? :P
2011-02-19T11:37:58  <McLeopold> the map scales to the box in any shape

2011-02-19T12:04:45  <McLeopold> okay, I can put in a "version 1" line
2011-02-19T12:04:59  <antimatroid> the biggest most important thing is you are sending state information rather than commands
2011-02-19T12:05:01  <McLeopold> Frontier: be prepared for the row/col switch
2011-02-19T12:05:11  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-19T12:05:23  <antimatroid> you are just sending information about where ants/food are
2011-02-19T12:05:29  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T12:05:29  <antimatroid> not what direction ants walked into
2011-02-19T12:05:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-19T12:05:33  <antimatroid> in*
2011-02-19T12:05:43  <McLeopold> is that bad?
2011-02-19T12:05:46  <antimatroid> that's not what frontier and i were expecting/wanting
2011-02-19T12:05:51  <McLeopold> really?
2011-02-19T12:05:55  <antimatroid> nope :P
2011-02-19T12:06:01  <antimatroid> look both on etherpad and specs page
2011-02-19T12:06:05  <McLeopold> Did you just want that for the visualizer?
2011-02-19T12:06:10  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-19T12:06:11  <Frontier> We'd like to animate the steps, so it is important to get these commands as output
2011-02-19T12:06:18  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-19T12:06:27  *** Prillicy <Prillicy!~chatzilla@97.104.19.221> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2011-02-19T12:06:34  <McLeopold> I can stuff the bot commands in there
2011-02-19T12:06:39  <antimatroid> that way the ants can "slide" when they walk, and fading colliding ants, or battles is easier
2011-02-19T12:06:43  <McLeopold> they would be 'O' lines
2011-02-19T12:07:16  <McLeopold> you'd have to check if the target space has an ant to know if to fade
2011-02-19T12:07:18  <antimatroid> Frontier: you might need to receive W/O and C lines both for the same ant
2011-02-19T12:07:31  <McLeopold> C?
2011-02-19T12:07:37  <antimatroid> colliding ants
2011-02-19T12:07:37  <Frontier> Collision
2011-02-19T12:07:43  <antimatroid> look on etherpad
2011-02-19T12:07:46  <McLeopold> That's a dead ant, 'D'

2011-02-19T12:08:24  <McLeopold> Did you want to know the different between running into yourself and dying from an enemy?
2011-02-19T12:08:27  <antimatroid> i thought we didn't see D for a collided ant?
2011-02-19T12:08:37  <antimatroid> haha, we're all on a different page
2011-02-19T12:08:42  <McLeopold> we should, it might be broken
2011-02-19T12:09:07  <antimatroid> did you find my note for the visualiser input part on etherpad?
2011-02-19T12:09:25  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-02-19T12:09:35  <antimatroid> search for "McLeopold!! just here"
2011-02-19T12:09:49  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-19T12:10:40  <McLeopold> other than sending the 'O' lines from the bots, that's all unnecessary.
2011-02-19T12:10:41  <Frontier> McLeopold: When an ant dies, but it moved in the same turn I need the move and the death as information (or the collision command which combines both)
2011-02-19T12:10:59  <McLeopold> You can derive all that info
2011-02-19T12:11:20  <McLeopold> I just need to send the ant orders as well.
2011-02-19T12:12:02  <antimatroid> he shouldn't need to derive that info
2011-02-19T12:12:05  <Frontier> ok they are equal to the move commands, right?
2011-02-19T12:12:12  <McLeopold> I don't want to clutter the spec or replay.
2011-02-19T12:12:15  <McLeopold> It isn't that hard
2011-02-19T12:12:24  <McLeopold> You can do it during the parsing phase
2011-02-19T12:12:46  <McLeopold> O from_row from_col direction
2011-02-19T12:13:08  <McLeopold> When parsing the line, just calc the to location...
2011-02-19T12:13:21  <McLeopold> Then, depending on what is there now, set the flag you need.
2011-02-19T12:13:45  <McLeopold> Flags being, collide, new food, battle, whatever
2011-02-19T12:13:55  <McLeopold> I can add it to my visualizer as an example
2011-02-19T12:14:44  <McLeopold> Also, I want you guys to know that whatever you need to make the visualizer *cool*, I will provide.  I just want to keep the file size as small as possible.
2011-02-19T12:15:03  <antimatroid> McLeopold, Frontier: are these three lines sufficient?
2011-02-19T12:15:03  <antimatroid> O row col direction    #walk antC row col              #kill ants landing here due to collisionK row col              #turn ant/food into land from battle
2011-02-19T12:15:08  <antimatroid> gah
2011-02-19T12:15:24  <antimatroid> O row col direction    #walk ant
2011-02-19T12:15:24  <antimatroid> C row col              #kill ants landing here due to collision
2011-02-19T12:15:24  <antimatroid> K row col              #turn ant/food into land from battle
2011-02-19T12:15:42  <McLeopold> You don't need the C, because there will be a D flag in location of an ants destination
2011-02-19T12:16:12  <McLeopold> You don't need the K, because a location will turn from food to an ant.
2011-02-19T12:16:32  <antimatroid> it was going to be done in 3 phases, so you knew when someone was dying from a collision then could see who was involved in the battles etc.
2011-02-19T12:16:33  <McLeopold> ^^ I mean S
2011-02-19T12:17:09  <McLeopold> It can still be done.
2011-02-19T12:17:26  <McLeopold> I promise, if I add the O lines, you've got everything you need
2011-02-19T12:17:36  <antimatroid> Frontier: what do you want?
2011-02-19T12:17:52  <janzert> only paying minimal attention, but not having to completely and correctly implement the engine in the visualizer is good
2011-02-19T12:17:57  <Frontier> I can do a little work on the parser side.
2011-02-19T12:18:07  <antimatroid> i'm with janzert there
2011-02-19T12:18:12  <Frontier> I just don't want to implement the game rules in the visualizer
2011-02-19T12:18:12  <janzert> so you may not want the visualizer to need to derive too much, such as battle resolution
2011-02-19T12:18:14  <antimatroid> particularly when people will go and make their own visualisers
2011-02-19T12:18:25  <antimatroid> it doesn't have to do battle resolution
2011-02-19T12:18:25  <McLeopold> janzert: that wouldn't be necessary, only a few quick checks in the parsing phase only
2011-02-19T12:18:54  <McLeopold> it doesn't need battle resolution, because we are sending the D lines
2011-02-19T12:19:20  <McLeopold> It would only really need the vision code, for cool effects.
2011-02-19T12:19:47  <Frontier> So the only game rule I have to implement is a check if there are several ants on the same square after a move -> collision
2011-02-19T12:19:54  <antimatroid> it's going to mean saying "hey does more than one ant land in this destination? yes, okay fade while walking", "is that square information meant to be changing? from what? do that then?"
2011-02-19T12:20:07  <antimatroid> if you give the commands, it's just a matter of going bam do that, bam do this
2011-02-19T12:20:43  <McLeopold> Frontier: the check would be this, when you parse an O line, calc the destination and see what is there, set the correct flag (move, kill, colision)
2011-02-19T12:21:10  <McLeopold> Frontier: also, check land turning into food, food disappearing and food turning into ants
2011-02-19T12:21:14  <Frontier> Well, it is a move in any case
2011-02-19T12:21:26  <McLeopold> Right, it might be a move, or a move death
2011-02-19T12:21:56  <Frontier> You do send death lines, do you?
2011-02-19T12:22:00  <antimatroid> i don't have to write the visualiser, but i think you're making it harder for whoever does write them
2011-02-19T12:22:02  <McLeopold> You could also set a flag as to how many ants died at a destination
2011-02-19T12:22:13  <McLeopold> Frontier: I should be, it might be broken...
2011-02-19T12:22:39  <McLeopold> Okay, I will implement this in my visualizer today.  You can pull my parsing and data structures.
2011-02-19T12:23:08  <Frontier> and land turning into food, food disappearing and food turning into ants are all seperate lines, too?
2011-02-19T12:23:34  <amstan> contestbot: seen j3camero
2011-02-19T12:23:34  <contestbot> amstan: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 1 week, 1 day, 15 hours, 31 minutes, and 44 seconds ago: <j3camero> I am still stuck on getting the #$%^ user_sadbox to work in non-security mode so I can test the engine. I have to stop working for today. Grrrr.
2011-02-19T12:23:34  <antimatroid> i think he wants you to work that out
2011-02-19T12:23:35  <McLeopold> Well, you would get an F line, then check the state of the last move
2011-02-19T12:24:05  <McLeopold> Maybe I should just write the code...
2011-02-19T12:24:24  <antimatroid> ... i'd prefer to agree on something that will work first :P
2011-02-19T12:24:30  <antimatroid> writing code leads to being stuck with it
2011-02-19T12:25:18  <Frontier> An F line is for spawning food, ok. But what about the two other situations?
2011-02-19T12:25:32  <antimatroid> Frontier: F is not for spawning atm
2011-02-19T12:25:41  <antimatroid> i think you're getting sent F for any square that is currenty food
2011-02-19T12:25:47  <McLeopold> an L line will be sent when food disappears, also, the F line won't be repeated
2011-02-19T12:26:03  <antimatroid> change that L line to K?
2011-02-19T12:26:12  <antimatroid> then we're all agreed on that :P
2011-02-19T12:26:12  <Frontier> = kill
2011-02-19T12:26:28  <antimatroid> or, D
2011-02-19T12:26:33  <antimatroid> to keep with your death square info
2011-02-19T12:26:39  <McLeopold> Food dies?
2011-02-19T12:26:49  <antimatroid> in battle if there is conflict yeah?
2011-02-19T12:26:50  <Frontier> Ok, my head is filling up slowly :). Food can die if it is contested by two parties
2011-02-19T12:27:16  <antimatroid> a.*.b
2011-02-19T12:27:52  <McLeopold> I know food is removed, I just wouldn't use the word 'dies', or put a D line.  An L line is good enough.
2011-02-19T12:28:29  <Frontier> ok, the last situation: food is converted into a new ant
2011-02-19T12:28:30  <McLeopold> how about 'omgponies! row col' for removing food?
2011-02-19T12:28:45  <Frontier> hmm... may bloat the file
2011-02-19T12:28:53  <antimatroid> it was a joke :P
2011-02-19T12:28:54  <McLeopold> you have food, see, then an A line comes along.
2011-02-19T12:28:58  <Frontier> let's define macros in the header
2011-02-19T12:29:21  <Frontier> antimatroid: I know it was a joke ^^.
2011-02-19T12:29:48  <Frontier> an A line along with an L line, or just A?
2011-02-19T12:29:59  <Frontier> (both is ok for me)
2011-02-19T12:30:00  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think my last change request is that you have an "end of turn line" which is either "scores" or "end" followed by the players scores
2011-02-19T12:30:09  <McLeopold> it's there
2011-02-19T12:30:16  <antimatroid> and end should be the very last line of input
2011-02-19T12:30:30  <McLeopold> followed by the last state of the game
2011-02-19T12:30:49  <antimatroid> no, it should be the last line of input
2011-02-19T12:30:53  <antimatroid> do an extra "turn"
2011-02-19T12:30:59  <McLeopold> why?
2011-02-19T12:31:05  <antimatroid> because it's more clear
2011-02-19T12:31:07  <McLeopold> I need a really really good reason.
2011-02-19T12:31:32  <antimatroid> and at the end of each turn, do a line
2011-02-19T12:31:33  <antimatroid> score p1score ... pnscore
2011-02-19T12:31:43  <McLeopold> what I'm sending is, "The game is over.  Here's why."
2011-02-19T12:31:46  <Frontier> antimatroid: I think it is ok the way McLeopold put that
2011-02-19T12:32:15  <Frontier> It sounds reasonable to me.
2011-02-19T12:32:26  <antimatroid> but the visualiser currently doesn't know the scores after each turn?
2011-02-19T12:32:35  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-19T12:32:41  <McLeopold> yeah, I need to add that
2011-02-19T12:32:46  <antimatroid> hence my score line :P
2011-02-19T12:32:46  <Frontier> Can you also send scores on every turn so I can update it?
2011-02-19T12:32:46  <McLeopold> But only to the replay
2011-02-19T12:33:04  <Frontier> oh kinda double post
2011-02-19T12:33:04  <antimatroid> we're only talking about the visualiser input atm
2011-02-19T12:33:51  <antimatroid> can you both check the sample input?
2011-02-19T12:33:59  <McLeopold> the score line will come right after the turn line
2011-02-19T12:34:15  <McLeopold> 'turn 1\nscore 0 0 0 0'
2011-02-19T12:34:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I still think it would make sense for "end" to be the very last line of input passed
2011-02-19T12:34:41  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-19T12:34:45  <antimatroid> why not?
2011-02-19T12:34:49  <McLeopold> because
2011-02-19T12:34:50  <antimatroid> it's a lot clearer
2011-02-19T12:35:03  <Frontier> because ? Oo
2011-02-19T12:35:29  <McLeopold> because it makes more sense to keep that info at the beginning of each state
2011-02-19T12:35:55  <antimatroid> hmmm maybe with state information
2011-02-19T12:36:03  <antimatroid> i'm still thinking in terms of what the visualiser is doing
2011-02-19T12:36:16  <McLeopold> I'll ask it...
2011-02-19T12:36:19  <antimatroid> it's taking your state information, but then interpreting the commands from that and showing them, then showing the score
2011-02-19T12:36:19  <Frontier> That is ok. There is a state in the visualizer anyways
2011-02-19T12:36:31  <McLeopold> the visualizer says I'm right...
2011-02-19T12:36:34  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-19T12:37:11  <Frontier> On the highest level I have a start and end state for each turn.
2011-02-19T12:37:15  <antimatroid> bleh, i'm going to bed, you guys can work it out, i don't even need to deal with the format :P
2011-02-19T12:37:24  <McLeopold> antimatroid: you got that backwards
2011-02-19T12:37:36  <McLeopold> sleep well
2011-02-19T12:37:38  <antimatroid> how is it backwards?
2011-02-19T12:37:39  <Frontier> thx for the support antimatroid, n8
2011-02-19T12:37:55  <McLeopold> turn 1, nothing has happened
2011-02-19T12:38:29  <antimatroid> my intention was to be like
2011-02-19T12:38:29  <antimatroid> turn 1 -> here are the commands the visualiser needs to make -> heres the resulting score
2011-02-19T12:38:41  <Frontier> McLeopold: Originally (in antimatroid's ant game) there were spawn commands 'before' turn 1.
2011-02-19T12:38:42  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-19T12:38:51  <McLeopold> spawning food?
2011-02-19T12:38:58  <antimatroid> now it seems to be like
2011-02-19T12:38:58  <antimatroid> turn 1 -> scores from new state -> new state -> work out moves -> implement moves -> display score
2011-02-19T12:39:19  <Frontier> oh wait
2011-02-19T12:39:34  <McLeopold> the visualizer should parse the replay info into an organized data structure first, then it can display stuff in any order
2011-02-19T12:39:48  <Frontier> turn 1 should have scores: 0 0 0 ...
2011-02-19T12:39:51  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T12:40:07  <McLeopold> so 'turn 1' means the start of turn 1
2011-02-19T12:40:15  <Frontier> alright
2011-02-19T12:40:21  <antimatroid> i had scores being for the end of the turn then
2011-02-19T12:40:30  <McLeopold> then you get the state at the start of turn 1, before the turn 1 orders were sent
2011-02-19T12:40:47  <antimatroid> isn't that the char map you just sent?
2011-02-19T12:40:59  *** Prillicy_ <Prillicy_!~chatzilla@97.104.19.221> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-19T12:41:01  <McLeopold> because we have an end line, we want the scores for the start of the state
2011-02-19T12:41:54  <McLeopold> uhh...
2011-02-19T12:42:23  <antimatroid> if you send the state at the beginning of turn 1 befor any moves have been made, you send the state as it was with the char map sent to the visualiser?
2011-02-19T12:42:29  <McLeopold> crap

2011-02-19T12:48:42  <McLeopold> Frontier: I was mashing turn 0 and turn 1 info into the map at the start.
2011-02-19T12:48:58  <McLeopold> so I was giving the state after the moves, instead of before
2011-02-19T12:49:31  <Frontier> so the char map contained the results of the moves?

2011-02-19T12:49:44  <McLeopold> no, it contained the start, with the starting food
2011-02-19T12:49:50  <McLeopold> then 'turn 1'
2011-02-19T12:50:01  <McLeopold> then the state after turn 1, which was a mistake
2011-02-19T12:50:22  <McLeopold> which is why antimatroid was confused about my end state.
2011-02-19T12:50:42  <Frontier> but i wasn't confused, now i am ^^

2011-02-19T12:51:28  <McLeopold> So, for the bot input, a bot gets 'turn 1' then the state before turn one moves, which is the starting state with food, which is also the char map at the top of the replay file
2011-02-19T12:51:37  <Frontier> turn 1, score at the start of turn 1, actions in turn 1
2011-02-19T12:51:54  <antimatroid> i'm so lost :P
2011-02-19T12:52:00  <McLeopold> I want the replay file to be consistent with the bot input
2011-02-19T12:52:31  <antimatroid> why?
2011-02-19T12:53:06  <Frontier> Because it is easier to maintain would be a reason
2011-02-19T12:53:13  <McLeopold> So you can send the replay file to a bot, and it can interpret it the same as if it was playing.
2011-02-19T12:53:36  <janzert> it would also be less confusing when going between looking at one or the other
2011-02-19T12:53:52  <McLeopold> Yeah, so, my example replay file is messed up
2011-02-19T12:54:28  <McLeopold> check the top of the etherpad

2011-02-19T12:55:40  <McLeopold> or a little down
2011-02-19T12:55:50  <Frontier> That is a good goal, but the bot input is just a (any) game state, while the replay contains the actual actions taken by the bots and no fog of war
2011-02-19T12:56:18  <McLeopold> true, but a bot could throw out the info it knows it wouldn't get
2011-02-19T12:56:37  <Prillicy_> so are we really not going with option 3? the first post I saw for the death methods
2011-02-19T12:56:43  <McLeopold> So you can still test what your bot would do in someone else's shoes

2011-02-19T12:58:41  <jmcarthur> not identical
2011-02-19T12:58:59  <Prillicy> there should be no radius of death

2011-02-19T12:59:35  <jmcarthur> i think option 3 actually leads to the ability to block arbitrary-width corridors though, iirc

2011-02-19T13:00:14  <Frontier> McLeopold: version must come first, ok? just so there cannot be any 'new' features before the version is known
2011-02-19T13:00:15  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: option 1 allows you to block 1-wide and i think 2-wide

2011-02-19T13:03:33  <Prillicy_> as I was saying, blocking a corridor is a strategy that may not be successful, stopping people strategizing defeats the purpose of an AI challenge

2011-02-19T13:05:12  <Prillicy> period
2011-02-19T13:05:14  <Prillicy> no work around
2011-02-19T13:05:15  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-19T13:05:16  <Prillicy> no tricks
2011-02-19T13:05:18  <Prillicy> simple
2011-02-19T13:05:22  <jmcarthur> that's not the option 3 i was talking about
2011-02-19T13:05:31  <flag> Prillicy's option 3 is if (x1, y1) == (x2, y2), death
2011-02-19T13:05:54  <Prillicy> it's simple, and it allows for thousands of strategies
2011-02-19T13:06:08  <jmcarthur> i'm not seeing much strategy in it, myself
2011-02-19T13:06:11  <flag> Which is odd because it allows enemies to switch positions without interacting, IMO
2011-02-19T13:06:12  <Prillicy> I don't understand why you all (who've already coded the above) feel the need to add all this complexity
2011-02-19T13:06:15  <jmcarthur> but okay, no corridor blocking with that
2011-02-19T13:06:24  <McLeopold> Prillicy: it is simple, but Jeff didn't want a game of chase or ants slipping through lines, thus the range attack.
2011-02-19T13:06:39  <Prillicy> then roll a d20 instead
2011-02-19T13:06:51  <Prillicy> add bonuses for nearby allies
2011-02-19T13:06:56  <Prillicy> and negatives for nearby enemies
2011-02-19T13:07:11  <jmcarthur> how is that at all simpler than our other proposals?
2011-02-19T13:07:22  <Prillicy> I don
2011-02-19T13:07:27  <Prillicy> I don't propose it
2011-02-19T13:07:30  <Prillicy> I propose my way
2011-02-19T13:07:40  <Prillicy> jeff's being stupid
2011-02-19T13:07:53  <Prillicy> you heard me

2011-02-19T13:08:06  <Prillicy> he's been argumentative over silly things since the beginning of this
2011-02-19T13:08:22  <Prillicy> stop overdoing i

2011-02-19T13:08:27  <Prillicy> DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL
2011-02-19T13:08:48  <jmcarthur> what wheel are we reinventing, exactly?
2011-02-19T13:08:50  <flag> I think the main argument against your proposal is that the strategy becomes fairly shallow, Prillicy
2011-02-19T13:09:06  <flag> At least, when only a few ants in a small area are concerned
2011-02-19T13:09:19  <flag> There's still strategy on how to gather food, where to explore, etc.
2011-02-19T13:09:22  <jmcarthur> Prillicy's proposal still allows for a reasonable amount of macro
2011-02-19T13:09:32  <flag> Yeah, that's what I meant
2011-02-19T13:09:34  <jmcarthur> i just don't like it because it has zero micro
2011-02-19T13:09:46  <Prillicy> flag: incorrect, it allows for shallow strategies to work, but it also leaves open the option for more complex strategies
2011-02-19T13:09:53  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: example?
2011-02-19T13:09:53  <Prillicy> jmcarthur: what do you mean by micro in this case
2011-02-19T13:10:28  <McLeopold> Micro is tactics, Macro is strategy.  Do we all agree?
2011-02-19T13:10:31  <Prillicy> for example, a "find food, go for it, find enemies, go for it" strategy works, without having to build complex formulas to account for allied ants so that you don't "mass die"
2011-02-19T13:11:00  <Prillicy> maybe one call, don't move if there's an ally in that square, could be added for safety
2011-02-19T13:11:02  <Prillicy> however
2011-02-19T13:11:04  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: i mean that your proposal allows you to say things like "i want to try blocking my opponent from this territory", but not things like "i want to protect this ant while attacking that ant so he can live and kill this other ant on the next turn and fight efficiently"
2011-02-19T13:11:34  <Prillicy> building out formulas based on map size and shape, positions of enemy ants, shifting squares with enemies to avoid death...all of this could still function
2011-02-19T13:11:35  <antimatroid> that was so much fun reading through that knowing Prillicy and jmcarthur were talking about different option 3's ahaha
2011-02-19T13:11:39  <jmcarthur> that is, your proposal emphasizes high-level decisions and deemphasizes details
2011-02-19T13:11:44  <antimatroid> i'm terrible at going to bed, hang on, still catching up
2011-02-19T13:11:51  <antimatroid> reddit is too addictive
2011-02-19T13:12:01  <Prillicy> jmcarthur: I disagree
2011-02-19T13:12:18  <Prillicy> jmcarthur: details can be analyzed a lot, including, using other ants to protect certain ants
2011-02-19T13:12:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: go to bed, I except to see a quit line very soon!
2011-02-19T13:12:28  <Prillicy> more than that, I don't see any proof
2011-02-19T13:12:42  <Prillicy> good thing you don't expect it
2011-02-19T13:12:53  <jmcarthur> i think the proof is on you to show that there's more to battling with your proposal than just throwing armies at each other
2011-02-19T13:13:16  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i never quit :P
2011-02-19T13:13:19  <Prillicy> jmcarthur: you want to see the complexity of one on one ant movement? consider this game strategy
2011-02-19T13:13:47  <Prillicy> you see an enemy ant, and you've managed to close to right next to each other
2011-02-19T13:13:57  <jmcarthur> i don't care about complexity. i care about tactical decisions having an actual effect on the outcome
2011-02-19T13:14:05  <Prillicy> if you move to the enemy ant's square, he could choose to move, or nto
2011-02-19T13:14:14  <Prillicy> if he doesn't move, you'll die, but you'll kill him
2011-02-19T13:14:20  <jmcarthur> you are describing game theory
2011-02-19T13:14:25  <Prillicy> he he moves, you'll both still be right next to each other
2011-02-19T13:14:26  <Prillicy> yes
2011-02-19T13:14:28  <Prillicy> I am
2011-02-19T13:14:32  <jmcarthur> that is not what i'm talking about
2011-02-19T13:14:38  <Prillicy> that's 1 on 1 battles
2011-02-19T13:14:45  <Prillicy> that sort of dance could go on for days between 2 ants
2011-02-19T13:14:50  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-02-19T13:14:54  <Prillicy> and you could move allies around to cut off enemy escape routs
2011-02-19T13:14:57  <Prillicy> *routes
2011-02-19T13:15:01  <Prillicy> thus, real military tactics
2011-02-19T13:15:03  <jmcarthur> a game of chicken, you mean
2011-02-19T13:15:11  <jmcarthur> which is not really what i think of as "fun"
2011-02-19T13:15:31  <McLeopold> unless you had enough ants to give no options but retreat
2011-02-19T13:15:32  <Prillicy> so you want to add 900% difficulty for beginners to add some "fun" that only you seem to enjoy?
2011-02-19T13:15:45  <antimatroid> unless you're stupid enough to collide your own ants, it's 1:1, which is very boring micro wise
2011-02-19T13:15:47  <flag> Prillicy: your proposal always has even trades. There is no way for me to gain an advantage on an opponent except by gathering more food than them.
2011-02-19T13:15:59  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: a vast exaggeration
2011-02-19T13:16:26  <antimatroid> a beginer will do find with the strategy of "move as many ants as close to the enemy as possible"
2011-02-19T13:16:29  <Prillicy> flag: that is the idea
2011-02-19T13:16:45  <flag> Prillicy: if that is the idea, you're making the game more shallow
2011-02-19T13:16:55  <Prillicy> no
2011-02-19T13:16:56  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: i prefer more ways to gain advantages
2011-02-19T13:16:59  <Prillicy> I'm giving a purpose to food
2011-02-19T13:16:59  <McLeopold> Prillicy: what if ants were big enough to occupy a 3x3 grid, then they only had to step on part of an ant to kill it?
2011-02-19T13:17:00  <jmcarthur> or to lose advantages
2011-02-19T13:17:04  <Prillicy> otherwise, throw out food altogether
2011-02-19T13:17:12  <jmcarthur> food gives you a way to account for mistakes
2011-02-19T13:17:16  <Prillicy> in planet wars, were there really that many ways to gain advantages?
2011-02-19T13:17:26  <jmcarthur> planet wars was a very shallow game, IMO
2011-02-19T13:17:36  <antimatroid> with big brick walls
2011-02-19T13:17:47  <Prillicy> yet this site took off like wildfire because of it
2011-02-19T13:17:49  <antimatroid> while it was fun to watch and an interesting thought problem, i don't think it was a great ai game
2011-02-19T13:18:04  <Prillicy> I would have given up if it had been more complex
2011-02-19T13:18:26  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: were you around for tron?
2011-02-19T13:18:32  <Prillicy> no
2011-02-19T13:18:37  <antimatroid> we want a game that's simple to understand but provides a long, clear and smooth path to the top
2011-02-19T13:18:50  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: it was waaay simpler than planet wars, and i liked it waaaay more. i am not arguing for complexity here at all
2011-02-19T13:18:52  <Prillicy> your game is no longer simple to understand
2011-02-19T13:18:56  <Prillicy> 1:1 trades make sense
2011-02-19T13:19:06  <antimatroid> no they don't
2011-02-19T13:19:09  <Prillicy> 1:5 trades with strange and complex math problems doen't
2011-02-19T13:19:17  <antimatroid> it's not complex maths at all
2011-02-19T13:19:26  <antimatroid> it's just try to get more enemies closer to them than they do you
2011-02-19T13:19:34  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: so your argument boils down to "i don't want to have to think as i program AI"?
2011-02-19T13:19:47  <McLeopold> Prillicy: you don't need to argue anything.  The current plan is to be very close to 1:1.
2011-02-19T13:19:51  <Prillicy> no, my argument boils down to: you want new players
2011-02-19T13:19:52  <jmcarthur> there is nothing strange or complex about this stuff though
2011-02-19T13:20:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I still expect battle option 1
2011-02-19T13:20:06  <antimatroid> :p
2011-02-19T13:20:11  <Prillicy> I still don't understand any of the options tbh
2011-02-19T13:20:15  <Prillicy> so don't tell me it's not complex
2011-02-19T13:20:17  <Prillicy> I've read it tons
2011-02-19T13:20:17  <McLeopold> You bot is going to do poorly then. :)
2011-02-19T13:20:27  <flag> Wait, so the current play is not option 1?
2011-02-19T13:20:29  <janzert> I don't think the amount of growth with the last contest seemed more of a continuation of the growth we saw during tron as well, so I'm not sure planetwar's specifics had a great deal to do with it

2011-02-19T13:21:35  <antimatroid> it's slightly inconvenient that 2 is the "current one", but that's the order they poppep up

2011-02-19T13:22:40  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: option 1: for each ant, count the number of ants they are fighting and assign them that number. the only ants that survive are the ones whose numbers are smaller than those of their opponents
2011-02-19T13:22:44  <McLeopold> Prillicy: what if ants were big enough to occupy a 3x3 grid, then they only had to step on part of an ant to kill it?
2011-02-19T13:23:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: you aren't using 'f' for food and score information are you?
2011-02-19T13:23:20  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: option 2: iteratively remove pairs of fighting ants, starting with closest
2011-02-19T13:23:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: to the etherpad
2011-02-19T13:23:28  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: IMO, option 2 is more complicated in practice
2011-02-19T13:23:43  <jmcarthur> whereas option 1 takes a longer explanation, but is actually very simple
2011-02-19T13:24:23  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: the explanation is very simple for option 1 with a bit of maths notation
2011-02-19T13:24:41  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: and i get the feeling that Prillicy is being a little anti-intellectual about stuff like that :\

2011-02-19T13:26:22  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-19T13:26:28  <Prillicy> jmcarthur: cute
2011-02-19T13:26:32  <Prillicy> what about it?
2011-02-19T13:26:32  <McLeopold> would that be simple enough?
2011-02-19T13:26:44  <Prillicy> you want to make ants bigger than one square? all you're doing is making ants move slower
2011-02-19T13:26:53  <Prillicy> squares represent movement
2011-02-19T13:26:55  <Prillicy> nothing else
2011-02-19T13:27:00  <McLeopold> relatively
2011-02-19T13:27:01  <McLeopold> sure
2011-02-19T13:27:10  <McLeopold> but, is the battle still simple enough?
2011-02-19T13:27:21  <McLeopold> you step on an ant, you kill both
2011-02-19T13:27:25  <Prillicy> yes
2011-02-19T13:27:26  <Prillicy> it make sense
2011-02-19T13:27:32  <Prillicy> because you collided, like in a war
2011-02-19T13:27:38  <flag> Then you understand option 2
2011-02-19T13:27:39  <Prillicy> the two of you fight to the death when you collide
2011-02-19T13:27:40  <McLeopold> okay then, you'd have the opportunity to stop on 2
2011-02-19T13:27:46  <McLeopold> right?
2011-02-19T13:27:54  <McLeopold> 2 ants that is
2011-02-19T13:28:14  <Prillicy> you're trying to explain option 2 incorrectly
2011-02-19T13:28:25  <Prillicy> consider that you'd also kill your own ants if you collided with them
2011-02-19T13:28:37  <antimatroid> option 2 is harder to explain
2011-02-19T13:28:40  <Prillicy> and in collision there's an opportunity to run into 2 also
2011-02-19T13:28:43  <McLeopold> that's what I said, 'you kill both'
2011-02-19T13:28:54  <Prillicy> or 5 for that matter
2011-02-19T13:29:09  <Prillicy> so yes, you'd kill your ant and the enemy if you stepped on both
2011-02-19T13:29:14  <McLeopold> if there are 5 enemies close enough that you can step on all of them at once, then yes
2011-02-19T13:29:28  <Prillicy> there can't be
2011-02-19T13:29:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-19T13:29:33  <Prillicy> 3x3 ants wouldn't allow that
2011-02-19T13:29:38  <Prillicy> they couldn't get that close to each other
2011-02-19T13:29:40  <McLeopold> the ant's would have to be bigger
2011-02-19T13:29:42  <jmcarthur> why not?
2011-02-19T13:29:56  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: assume you can't have your own ants overlapping
2011-02-19T13:29:58  <Prillicy> you can only move 1 square at a time jmcarthur
2011-02-19T13:30:00  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-19T13:30:13  <jmcarthur> what McLeopold said helped
2011-02-19T13:30:14  <jmcarthur> now i see
2011-02-19T13:30:33  <McLeopold> Okay, so if this is simple to understand, big ants, then so is ranged attack.
2011-02-19T13:30:47  <Prillicy> I understand ranged attack
2011-02-19T13:30:48  <McLeopold> Except you can have your "big ants" overlapping.
2011-02-19T13:31:01  <McLeopold> So you are just proposing range 0 attack.
2011-02-19T13:31:02  <Prillicy> I don't understand how ants gained ranged attack abilities, my ants are walking around with shotguns?
2011-02-19T13:31:11  <janzert> option 2 is like the ants are bigger when comparing against enemies but smaller for self collision, think small ants cooperate to pack closer together
2011-02-19T13:31:28  <flag> Prillicy: food doesn't trasnform into ants in real life either

2011-02-19T13:33:01  <jmcarthur> why indeed
2011-02-19T13:33:04  <antimatroid> because it's ant colonies fighting for resources

2011-02-19T13:36:01  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T13:36:06  <McLeopold> I cried over it
2011-02-19T13:36:06  <jmcarthur> what was that?
2011-02-19T13:36:10  <Prillicy> flag: my game isn't solvable, but if you add complexity to the game, you remove complexity from strategies
2011-02-19T13:36:29  <McLeopold> 'A glorious flip of the switch, and my code will become multithreaded'
2011-02-19T13:36:31  <Prillicy> the more complex the game, the less people have to be complex
2011-02-19T13:36:47  <flag> I don't understand this logic: "if you add complexity to the game, you remove complexity from strategies"
2011-02-19T13:36:49  <jmcarthur> that wouldn't have been legal anyway...
2011-02-19T13:37:10  <Prillicy> would you like proof flag?
2011-02-19T13:37:14  <flag> Sure
2011-02-19T13:37:28  <jmcarthur> i didn't see that as any sort of promise that i would finish my code though
2011-02-19T13:37:38  <Prillicy> I could list a number of games where this is self-evident, but instead I think examples are better
2011-02-19T13:38:10  <Prillicy> 2 ant collision allows opportunities to back-up ants, consider cost/benefit analysis of scouts having squads and squad sizes, etc.
2011-02-19T13:38:12  * jmcarthur is curious about what qualifies as proof for an already ambiguous claim
2011-02-19T13:38:29  <Frontier> RoboCom evolved a LOT of different strategies and it was complex
2011-02-19T13:38:33  <Prillicy> if one ant can strategically fend off hoards of enemies, then you remove any need for squads for scouts
2011-02-19T13:38:41  * antimatroid thinks prillicies option is like 2 in that it doesn't provide balance to spreading out
2011-02-19T13:38:43  <flag> But it can't, Prillicy
2011-02-19T13:38:52  <flag> One ant can only kill 4 ants if the opponent is stupid
2011-02-19T13:39:19  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it is option 2 with 0 range attacks
2011-02-19T13:39:39  <antimatroid> then it comes with all my issues with option 2 :P
2011-02-19T13:39:40  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: option 1 doesn't allow that at all, and option 2 does only if the one losing all those ants is doing it pretty much intentionally
2011-02-19T13:40:08  <antimatroid> not intentionally, option 1 rewards smart micro, option 2 punishes lack of smart micro
2011-02-19T13:40:09  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: and even then, only up to 4:1

2011-02-19T13:55:41  <antimatroid> yes, so it's a game of fastest growth?
2011-02-19T13:55:44  <Prillicy_> so it may behoove you to lure them away until you can reinforce
2011-02-19T13:55:45  <antimatroid> and not being stupid

2011-02-19T13:56:24  *** Prillicy_ is now known as Prillicy
2011-02-19T13:56:45  <Prillicy> not necessary (really sorry about my connection btw)
2011-02-19T13:56:58  <Prillicy> but all this game is, is a game of who has the most ants at the end
2011-02-19T13:57:06  <antimatroid> no it's not
2011-02-19T13:57:09  <Prillicy> so yes, it is a who grows fastest, allowing for you to fight if you wish
2011-02-19T13:57:36  <antimatroid> it's a game of who kills the most ants along with the end of game bonus
2011-02-19T13:57:37  <Prillicy> but if you fight, you weaken yourself and your opponent, potentially causing one of your other enemies to win
2011-02-19T13:57:51  <Prillicy> but if you fight, you also can keep your oponent from stealing your food
2011-02-19T13:57:58  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: when did i say "stupid"?
2011-02-19T13:58:05  <Prillicy> sorry, it was flag
2011-02-19T13:58:09  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-19T13:58:12  <antimatroid> which makes it even more of an issue with n-players
2011-02-19T13:58:17  <Prillicy> It's tough bouncing back and forth between logs with 2 second internet bursts
2011-02-19T13:58:22  <antimatroid> it turns into a waiting game wanting others to fight first
2011-02-19T13:58:35  <Prillicy> and stealth tactics become valid
2011-02-19T13:58:44  <Prillicy> allowing you to move around in enemy territory trying to steal food

2011-02-19T14:17:44  <McLeopold> Prillicy makes a very good point, that smaller attack radius will encourage grouping for fights.
2011-02-19T14:18:08  <McLeopold> Be cause we do need something to counter the spreading out to get food.
2011-02-19T14:18:32  <McLeopold> This is the same reason that option 1 is a good idea.
2011-02-19T14:18:55  <McLeopold> it encourages grouping for fights as well
2011-02-19T14:19:38  <McLeopold> So, we need to convince Jeff that chasing and dashing through lines are good for the game.
2011-02-19T14:20:43  <McLeopold> Do you all kill each other while I was gone?  Where is everyone?
2011-02-19T14:21:08  <flag> I think everyone gave up on arguing
2011-02-19T14:21:28  <flag> I agree that we need something to balence out the incentive to spread all your ants out
2011-02-19T14:22:12  <McLeopold> Prillicy is right in his analysis there.  I think he thinks the other options are more complex than they really are.
2011-02-19T14:22:42  <McLeopold> Going with an attack a spawn radius of 1 or 2 would help
2011-02-19T14:22:54  <McLeopold> attack and spawn
2011-02-19T14:23:19  <McLeopold> with option 2 that is
2011-02-19T14:23:30  <Prillicy> I originally thought it was colliding with food that caused ants to appear also btw, just so you know how little this game makes sense to the rest of the world
2011-02-19T14:23:45  <McLeopold> Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
2011-02-19T14:23:57  <McLeopold> It's just a math game now, but we do need a theme
2011-02-19T14:24:59  <McLeopold> Prillicy: so I wasn't clear about one thing.  Do you favor micro or not?  Micro being tactics.
2011-02-19T14:25:34  <McLeopold> Also meaning that you can put in a lot of effort to get a bot to kill way more ants than it will lose.
2011-02-19T14:25:36  <Prillicy> I prefer not to favor either
2011-02-19T14:25:48  <Prillicy> the more possibilities, the better
2011-02-19T14:25:49  <McLeopold> That explains it.
2011-02-19T14:26:05  <McLeopold> I think we agree on most of the goals for the game.
2011-02-19T14:26:13  <Prillicy> just not the method
2011-02-19T14:26:17  <Prillicy> I'll tell you this
2011-02-19T14:26:29  <Prillicy> I do favor smaller starter bots
2011-02-19T14:26:42  <McLeopold> Besides Hunter and Lefty?
2011-02-19T14:27:00  <Prillicy> if you could build this game to require less than 20 lines of code for a starter bot, can you imagine the complexity that people would have time to build into their bots over the same amount of time?
2011-02-19T14:27:42  <McLeopold> Have you looked at the java bots I made?
2011-02-19T14:27:46  <flag> Some of the starter bots can be logically expressed in less than 20 lines
2011-02-19T14:27:53  <Prillicy> yes, tried to put it in c# and was struggling
2011-02-19T14:27:56  <McLeopold> The bot logic itself is pretty tight
2011-02-19T14:28:36  <Prillicy> I actually wanted to ask you some questions about what you did
2011-02-19T14:28:57  <McLeopold> sure
2011-02-19T14:29:03  <McLeopold> with the framework?
2011-02-19T14:29:54  <jmcarthur> i suppose it would be prudent for me to start a haskell bot, by now
2011-02-19T14:30:08  <jmcarthur> is the spec reasonably nailed down now, at least for I/O?
2011-02-19T14:30:14  <flag> no
2011-02-19T14:30:17  <jmcarthur> :(

2011-02-19T14:30:22  <jmcarthur> ?
2011-02-19T14:30:24  <flag> Wait, it is?
2011-02-19T14:30:41  <McLeopold> yes, the engine doesn't follow it yet.  end of today it will
2011-02-19T14:30:45  <Prillicy> if you have time
2011-02-19T14:30:46  <Prillicy> alright, I'll put my questions together and get back with you in a few minutes
2011-02-19T14:30:46  <Prillicy> yes, specifically the ant class

2011-02-19T14:30:58  <flag> s/I //g
2011-02-19T14:31:08  <jmcarthur> well, i'm going to shut down, do a little necessary shopping, head to the local hackerspace, and start looking into making a haskell starter i guess
2011-02-19T14:31:25  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I'll post some sample bot input later
2011-02-19T14:31:32  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: awesome, thanks
2011-02-19T14:31:35  <jmcarthur> bbl
2011-02-19T14:31:56  <Prillicy> can you explain how the output from the engine represents each ant? like a breakdown?
2011-02-19T14:32:26  <McLeopold> A row col owner
2011-02-19T14:32:48  <McLeopold> so, if the owner is '0', it is your ant, at the location specified
2011-02-19T14:32:55  <Prillicy> so A is just a iteration? n r c u
2011-02-19T14:33:22  <Prillicy> or A is the actual text?
2011-02-19T14:33:32  <flag> The engine gives updates to the bot, A stands for ant
2011-02-19T14:33:38  <Prillicy> so how would I represent the ant that is at row 5 column 5
2011-02-19T14:33:43  <Prillicy> when I send it back to the engine
2011-02-19T14:34:08  <McLeopold> A is the actual character
2011-02-19T14:34:15  <McLeopold> like 'F' in planetwars
2011-02-19T14:34:18  <Prillicy> ^ *repeats
2011-02-19T14:34:33  <McLeopold> A 5 5 0
2011-02-19T14:34:48  <McLeopold> 0 based indexing, so 6th row, 6th col
2011-02-19T14:34:50  <Prillicy> when I send it back to the engine, wanting to move that ant to row 6, column 6
2011-02-19T14:34:59  <Prillicy> or whatever
2011-02-19T14:35:05  <McLeopold> that's diagonal
2011-02-19T14:35:06  <Prillicy> row 5 column 6
2011-02-19T14:35:08  <McLeopold> so no
2011-02-19T14:35:09  <Prillicy> because of movement
2011-02-19T14:35:12  <Prillicy> I know
2011-02-19T14:35:14  <Prillicy> I know
2011-02-19T14:35:15  <McLeopold> O 5 5 S
2011-02-19T14:35:17  <Prillicy> geez
2011-02-19T14:35:24  <McLeopold> O stands for order
2011-02-19T14:35:25  <Prillicy> ???
2011-02-19T14:35:30  <McLeopold> S stand for south
2011-02-19T14:35:47  <Prillicy> so 5 5 is the ant's representation
2011-02-19T14:35:50  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T14:35:51  <Prillicy> and S is the direction to move
2011-02-19T14:35:53  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T14:35:58  <Prillicy> so N S E W just cardinals
2011-02-19T14:36:01  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T14:36:07  <Prillicy> cool, now I understand, thanks
2011-02-19T14:36:17  <McLeopold> now, you just need to get the wrapping
2011-02-19T14:36:23  <McLeopold> on a map of 10x10...
2011-02-19T14:36:40  <McLeopold> o 9 9 s, the ant would end up at 9 0
2011-02-19T14:36:47  <Prillicy> right, that I understand
2011-02-19T14:36:50  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-19T14:36:54  <Prillicy> assuming no walls of course
2011-02-19T14:36:57  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-19T14:37:49  <flag> Question: does an ant have vision of area on the other side of the map in the case of wrapping?
2011-02-19T14:37:55  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T14:38:14  <McLeopold> that movie in the forum had a bug
2011-02-19T14:38:35  <flag> Okay, that movie is what confused me, thanks
2011-02-19T14:39:26  <Prillicy> and how are walls displayed in the output?
2011-02-19T14:39:27  <Prillicy> W 5 5?
2011-02-19T14:40:15  <Frontier> McLeopold: Is it correct that a 'D' for a dead ant is sent in the next turn?
2011-02-19T14:40:25  <Frontier> (visualizer wise)
2011-02-19T14:40:45  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-19T14:41:07  <McLeopold> the orders that caused a battle are sent, then 'turn x', then you see the results of the battle
2011-02-19T14:42:58  <Frontier> that makes sense. internally i'll move that to the 'end' of the prevoius turn.
2011-02-19T14:44:03  <McLeopold> all the 'D' lines?  that makes sense, then you can display the outcomes of moves
2011-02-19T14:44:15  <Frontier> Are keywords lower-case and are # comments allowed?
2011-02-19T14:44:22  <McLeopold> yes and yes
2011-02-19T14:44:41  <McLeopold> still, do a toLowerCase on all lines
2011-02-19T14:44:44  <Frontier> Sure one turn for me includes the initial state, actions and the outcome
2011-02-19T14:45:03  <McLeopold> the initial state is the same as last turns outcome
2011-02-19T14:45:12  <McLeopold> unless you separate food spawning?
2011-02-19T14:45:17  <Frontier> McLeopold: Maybe we want to include player names in future versions, I'll lower case the first token though
2011-02-19T14:45:29  <McLeopold> yes, I need to add player names
2011-02-19T14:46:24  <Frontier> hmm in v3 (visualiser version 3) I actually used to separate food spawning
2011-02-19T14:46:34  <McLeopold> you still can
2011-02-19T14:46:35  <janzert> somehow probably want player names and submission id eventually (whether or not that is in the actual replay data or separate probably doesn't matter)
2011-02-19T14:46:48  <McLeopold> what's submission id?
2011-02-19T14:47:02  <Frontier> the bot code I guess
2011-02-19T14:47:03  <janzert> the id of the actual submission that played the game
2011-02-19T14:47:17  <janzert> basically which submission of the player it was
2011-02-19T14:48:13  <Frontier> That is an optional information. For local simulations the player names and submission id shouldn't need to be set :)
2011-02-19T14:48:52  <Frontier> I'll default the player names to "Player n". Damn I whish I could i18n them :p
2011-02-19T14:49:22  <McLeopold> well, the info might be there, but default if it isn't
2011-02-19T14:56:51  <Prillicy> can we download our old planetwars uploaded bots? my computer (2 of them actually) died
2011-02-19T14:59:00  <amstan> apparently jeff was very busy last week
2011-02-19T14:59:04  <janzert> I don't think they're generally accessible, but so far as I know they are still on the server
2011-02-19T14:59:18  <amstan> Prillicy: i need your username and the submission date that you want
2011-02-19T14:59:25  <amstan> Prillicy: i can get them

2011-02-19T15:00:21  <McLeopold> that really ought to be a button on the user screen
2011-02-19T15:00:22  <Prillicy> McLeopold: I tried to look at your python bot and it 404-ed, where's your java bot?
2011-02-19T15:00:40  <McLeopold> it's all on git, but it is not stable
2011-02-19T15:01:01  <Prillicy> I just need to parse the output
2011-02-19T15:01:37  <McLeopold> engine output?:
2011-02-19T15:02:37  <Prillicy> yeah
2011-02-19T15:16:18  <McLeopold> so, I'm working on that now.  It will be more stable when you see the next commit message

2011-02-19T15:56:37  <McLeopold> it'll be there
2011-02-19T16:02:52  <Frontier> have you found a better solution than split() for the space separated tokens? It doesn't work so well for single argument commands that can take any string, like player name or game location

2011-02-19T16:20:15  <janzert> hmm, I wonder what odd historical curiosity stops python from accepting the keyword argument
2011-02-19T16:22:16  <Zannick> hm, does javascript return the last argument in split?
2011-02-19T16:22:48  <Zannick> i'm getting "a b c d e".split(" ",3) gives ["a", "b", "c"]
2011-02-19T16:23:23  <janzert> looks like it doesn't :(

2011-02-19T16:24:14  <janzert> that it is certainly less useful
2011-02-19T16:25:22  <Zannick> yeah
2011-02-19T16:25:28  <Frontier> oh... why did they do that? :/
2011-02-19T16:27:02  <Frontier> well at least i can cut off comments with it: split("#", 1)[0]
2011-02-19T16:27:15  <janzert> 'cause javascript was thrown together in a month with no time available for proper thought?
2011-02-19T16:28:07  <Zannick> Frontier: ahaha
2011-02-19T16:29:20  <Zannick> they probably implemented it as "as soon as i have this many in my array, return it"
2011-02-19T16:35:50  <McLeopold> uh, what's wrong with 'a b c d e'.split(' ');?
2011-02-19T16:41:48  <jmcarthur> yay, time to start a starter
2011-02-19T16:42:55  <Frontier> McLeopold: If a player name is "I am    legend" then split loses information

2011-02-19T22:29:08  <antimatroid> woah, the starting placement of food isn't even symmetric?
2011-02-19T22:29:11  <antimatroid> i don't know about that
2011-02-19T22:30:52  <flag> just noticed that, good point
2011-02-19T22:31:05  <amstan> submit an issue?
2011-02-19T22:31:59  <antimatroid> i'm not sure it's an issue
2011-02-19T22:32:19  <antimatroid> i think mcleopold did it that way
2011-02-19T22:32:51  <amstan> well, yeah, if you have identical bots, and symmetrical maps, the fights will be rather boring
2011-02-19T22:33:09  <antimatroid> a game with identical bots should be boring
2011-02-19T22:33:25  <antimatroid> with the "symmetric maps", if you come across an enemy, it's not on symmetric terms
2011-02-19T22:33:27  <amstan> yes, for the final thing, this is for demoing stuff
2011-02-19T22:33:32  <flag> Also, the food should probably spawn symmetrically as well
2011-02-19T22:33:34  <antimatroid> it just ensures you all start with exactly the same opportunity
2011-02-19T22:33:47  <flag> Is this not for the final thing?
2011-02-19T22:33:52  <antimatroid> flag: i want it to spawn symmetrically to starting positions, but nobody else (except now you) is with me on that
2011-02-19T22:34:05  <amstan> idk, i'm just stating possible reasons
2011-02-19T22:34:12  <antimatroid> everyone else is like meh, symmetry isn't important
2011-02-19T22:34:25  <flag> Really? People are against spawning food symmetrically?
2011-02-19T22:34:27  <flag> Why?
2011-02-19T22:34:38  <antimatroid> too boring apparently
2011-02-19T22:34:52  <antimatroid> (i think that was the reasoning against symmetry in general)
2011-02-19T22:34:59  <Zannick> for the record, i am completely uninvolved with this decision
2011-02-19T22:35:06  <flag> Why not make maps not symmetrical then?
2011-02-19T22:35:19  <antimatroid> i don't know
2011-02-19T22:35:25  <antimatroid> but i'll fight for as much symmetry as i can get
2011-02-19T22:35:41  <antimatroid> i don't think it's less boring, in fact i rather know the players won from an equally fair starting position
2011-02-19T22:36:15  <flag> It's also easier to see the differences between two bots with slightly different versions
2011-02-19T22:36:26  <antimatroid> yes, and for debugging etc. etc.
2011-02-19T22:36:36  <antimatroid> it doesn't really make sense to me
2011-02-19T22:37:55  <antimatroid> i think the way everything is being done for input now is silly, but with the exception of a little mess to get what I want with my bot, I don't need to deal with it, so I should really stop trying to get what i think would work best there
2011-02-19T22:38:12  <antimatroid> i'll finally fix up the specs page to waht mcleopold currently has in a little bit
2011-02-19T22:38:46  <flag> I don't mind the updates input if it really is more efficiant
2011-02-19T22:43:54  <jmcarthur> i don't see what's so efficient about this way of doing it
2011-02-19T22:44:16  <flag> less bytes
2011-02-19T22:44:31  <flag> For tcp, because maps are quite large
2011-02-19T22:44:47  <jmcarthur> compression is awesome though
2011-02-19T22:44:48  <flag> Although I suppose that could be built into the tcp client itself instead of the engine
2011-02-19T22:45:10  <antimatroid> yeah, but i don't see why we're sending land squares ever
2011-02-19T22:45:26  <flag> true
2011-02-19T22:45:28  <antimatroid> i'd be happy receiving lines of info for any currently visible ants, food or water
2011-02-19T22:45:30  <jmcarthur> is that what l is?
2011-02-19T22:45:50  <jmcarthur> looks like. yuck
2011-02-19T22:45:59  <antimatroid> but now it's any currently visible ant or food, you get water the first time you see it, and land the first time you see it, or after food disappeared (still don't really understand that)
2011-02-19T22:46:43  <antimatroid> that just makes it even more complicated to deal with, and i just don't really see why
2011-02-19T22:47:14  <antimatroid> i still think the visualiser should receive command info rather than state info each turn too, because otherwise it's just using hte state info to work out command info to show them
2011-02-19T22:47:27  <antimatroid> whereas if it just implemented commands thrown at it, the state would just resolve itself
2011-02-19T22:49:08  <antimatroid> i already need to take the info, create my own char map (including painting out what i can/cannot see myself) and then process that to look after all the information i want, it's then just making the process of determining what the current char map is harder
2011-02-19T22:49:24  <jmcarthur> totally
2011-02-19T22:49:46  <jmcarthur> it would be so much easier to just read in the data verbatim into an array
2011-02-19T22:50:00  <antimatroid> i agree but we're not getting that
2011-02-19T22:50:12  <antimatroid> short of that, it'd be easiest to receive info for any currently seeable ants, food or water
2011-02-19T22:50:25  <antimatroid> water could even only ever be sent once, but the extra land squares, silly
2011-02-19T22:50:56  <jmcarthur> i'm not entirely sure i understand when land and water are sent
2011-02-19T22:51:04  <flag> Maybe it's so the bots don't assume that unexplored area is land?
2011-02-19T22:51:10  <flag> As they would if it wasn't sent.
2011-02-19T22:51:14  <antimatroid> water is sent the first turn for which you can see it, never again
2011-02-19T22:51:35  <antimatroid> similarly with land, but if it was food that disappeared while out of your vision, it will show land information again once you're in view
2011-02-19T22:52:01  <jmcarthur> does it always show food if it's in range, or just the first time you see it?
2011-02-19T22:52:28  <antimatroid> if you get current water,ant,food info, the starter bots can just assume the map is all land at the start of each turn, read that info into place then go
2011-02-19T22:52:32  <jmcarthur> and i assume it always sends visible ants
2011-02-19T22:52:33  <antimatroid> first time you see it
2011-02-19T22:52:46  <antimatroid> always sends visible ants
2011-02-19T22:53:08  <jmcarthur> okay, so the only thing you can really wipe from memory reliably is ants. everything else must be retained?
2011-02-19T22:53:25  <antimatroid> you can't even wipe ants from your memory
2011-02-19T22:53:46  <jmcarthur> well, i mean if you were only going to save what's visible anyway
2011-02-19T22:53:49  <antimatroid> only those that are now in vision, and you also need to work out which of your ants you "didn't" get info for, meaning they died and weren't in view of a now live ant to see it
2011-02-19T22:54:02  <antimatroid> it's really really messy as it is
2011-02-19T22:54:05  <antimatroid> i really don't like it
2011-02-19T22:54:09  <jmcarthur> i just mean that if you were only going to save things you were *certain* about
2011-02-19T22:55:20  <flag> To be fair, if an ant was moved to a square somewhere and the next turn it isn't there, you can just assume it's dead
2011-02-19T22:55:20  <jmcarthur> also, what's the point of d?
2011-02-19T22:55:20  <antimatroid> flag: not necessarily
2011-02-19T22:55:34  <jmcarthur> i suppose d is to tell the difference between moving out of view and dying
2011-02-19T22:55:37  <antimatroid> the ant might have been able to walk out of visibility, or you might have just walked out of view of where they were, you don't want to just forget that there was an ant there
2011-02-19T22:55:52  <antimatroid> D is so you can get an idea of scoring
2011-02-19T22:56:02  <flag> You were talking about ants that you control
2011-02-19T22:56:05  <flag> Not enemy ants
2011-02-19T22:56:14  <antimatroid> i'm talking about any ant info
2011-02-19T22:56:39  <jmcarthur> is D given for all ants that die or just your own or just your opponents'?
2011-02-19T22:56:54  <antimatroid> but you can't just read now live ants into your 1 map and then go through and find the friend ants you didn't get new info for, you then need to separate what is new/old information, which makes it harder again
2011-02-19T22:57:40  <antimatroid> D is for all ants that die (probably needs to give a player), but you only see it for squares one of your live ants can currently see
2011-02-19T22:58:29  <flag> Wait, when an ant dies is the area of the map where the ant was updated with land (where the ant cannot see anymore)?
2011-02-19T22:58:41  <antimatroid> i'm not sure
2011-02-19T22:58:52  <antimatroid> my point is it's not intuitive, easy, etc. :P
2011-02-19T22:59:15  <flag> Perhaps, but it's supposed to be intuitive for the people using the starter packs, not writing them
2011-02-19T22:59:33  <antimatroid> it's making it unecessarily hard for everyone if you ask me
2011-02-19T22:59:45  <antimatroid> it's harder for people to expand the starter package to look after more information
2011-02-19T23:00:04  <antimatroid> it's harder for the engine to work out what information needs to be sent, it's harder for people writing the starter packages, etc. etc.
2011-02-19T23:00:08  <jmcarthur> well... i'm just gonna write this starter pack and hope i have to do some extra work later to change it to simpler I/O
2011-02-19T23:00:16  <antimatroid> i don't see where it makes anything any easier, i'm not even sure it'd make the input amount any different
2011-02-19T23:01:00  <flag> McLeopold claims the input amount is 10x less I think
2011-02-19T23:01:02  <jmcarthur> the only reason to do it this way seems to be efficiency, and i don't think it helps or matters
2011-02-19T23:01:09  <flag> But don't quote me on that
2011-02-19T23:01:09  <antimatroid> that's compared to a complete char map
2011-02-19T23:01:15  <flag> Yes
2011-02-19T23:01:18  <jmcarthur> who even cares? zlib is easy to use
2011-02-19T23:01:28  <jmcarthur> for tcp
2011-02-19T23:01:30  <antimatroid> i'm asking for current food,ant and water square info
2011-02-19T23:01:46  <antimatroid> as opposed to current ants, first time seen food,water,lan, newly returned land squares
2011-02-19T23:02:16  <antimatroid> the water square info could even be a first time thing, but i really don't see the point of that
2011-02-19T23:02:26  <jmcarthur> oh well. this is a battle i don't really care too much to fight. it makes programming harder, but at least it's not as pivotal to the game as combat resolution
2011-02-19T23:02:38  <flag> How do bots know the difference between unexplored area and land in your proposal?
2011-02-19T23:02:53  <jmcarthur> i'll just let it be known right now that i would prefer a complete char map, efficiency be damned
2011-02-19T23:03:14  <antimatroid> the starter bots would literally wipe the map each turn, then it'd be up to you to mark out what you have haven't seen
2011-02-19T23:03:20  <antimatroid> but you're already going to want to do that anyway
2011-02-19T23:03:32  <antimatroid> because you want to know when you last saw a square, which isn't given information
2011-02-19T23:03:59  <jmcarthur> i think that since this is going to be wanted by pretty much everybody i'll just go ahead and add the functionality to the starter
2011-02-19T23:04:09  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'm with you and fought for that, but i lost
2011-02-19T23:04:18  <jmcarthur> i'll just tag each square with the turn that it was last seen
2011-02-19T23:04:36  <antimatroid> no no, the starter package should be bare minimal easy strategy
2011-02-19T23:04:40  <antimatroid> so people can improve it easily
2011-02-19T23:04:45  <antimatroid> don't do their work for them
2011-02-19T23:04:52  <jmcarthur> but this is like... library level stuff
2011-02-19T23:05:05  <antimatroid> yes, which is all part of writing a bot imo
2011-02-19T23:05:08  <flag> So is battle resolution
2011-02-19T23:05:16  <jmcarthur> the only way to add this functionality is to write yet another implementation of the same data structures as the starter has already
2011-02-19T23:05:34  <jmcarthur> well, i guess you mean you can just change an arbitrary part of the starter
2011-02-19T23:05:39  <antimatroid> it's just adding more code where you process the input :\
2011-02-19T23:05:41  <jmcarthur> i was trying to be more modular in my approach
2011-02-19T23:05:53  <jmcarthur> where the starter is basically a library that doesn't need to be messed with
2011-02-19T23:06:01  <jmcarthur> and you just edit the main, basically
2011-02-19T23:06:12  <antimatroid> i'm not touching my bot again until io is settled
2011-02-19T23:06:15  *** nullkuhl_ is now known as nullkuhl
2011-02-19T23:06:17  <antimatroid> i've already changed it like 3 times
2011-02-19T23:06:32  <jmcarthur> well i haven't even started one. i just have like... a directory
2011-02-19T23:08:04  <flag> I've rewritten mine twice :P
2011-02-19T23:08:30  <flag> First to use a char map and then to use something that I later found out was the visualizer input
2011-02-19T23:08:41  <flag> Because I was linked to the wrong file
2011-02-19T23:08:46  <antimatroid> haha :P
2011-02-19T23:08:55  <flag> D:
2011-02-19T23:09:01  <antimatroid> everything is a mess

2011-02-19T23:10:26  <antimatroid> sending those 'L' squares is quite expensive
2011-02-19T23:10:46  <antimatroid> and i can only imagine how painful it is working out in the engine who to send what to
2011-02-19T23:11:29  <jmcarthur> probably not too painful, but probably expensive
2011-02-19T23:11:35  <jmcarthur> which i don't really care about
