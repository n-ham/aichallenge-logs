2011-04-07T00:08:21  <janzert> hmm :(
2011-04-07T00:08:47  <McLeopold> It will be faster.  It's the choosing of the map that is slowing me down, which isn't that critical.
2011-04-07T00:09:02  <janzert> even 1.5 seconds will be workable
2011-04-07T00:09:04  <McLeopold> I'll be happy if we get it to 500ms
2011-04-07T00:09:10  <janzert> just would be nice to be faster
2011-04-07T00:09:12  <janzert> yeah
2011-04-07T00:09:45  <McLeopold> This time around, I don't think the database will be to much of an issue.  I plan to get memcache working for most php pages.
2011-04-07T00:10:06  <janzert> great
2011-04-07T00:10:07  <McLeopold> So it should be free to churn on matchups and ranking.
2011-04-07T00:10:28  <McLeopold> btw, can you add memcache to the install scripts?
2011-04-07T00:10:33  <janzert> what I can do will be very limited from here on out, work is picking up into our busy season now
2011-04-07T00:10:36  <McLeopold> I can create an issue if you want
2011-04-07T00:10:52  <janzert> just using the apt package?
2011-04-07T00:11:10  <McLeopold> yeah, that's what I'm using locally.
2011-04-07T00:11:44  <McLeopold> I've never really looking into things like NoSQL, CouchDB or MongoDB
2011-04-07T00:12:23  <janzert> just need to add the package name to the list at line 27 in install_website_packages() of server_setup.py then
2011-04-07T00:12:58  <McLeopold> And something to get it in the startup scripts
2011-04-07T00:13:16  <janzert> apt won't have it start automatically already?
2011-04-07T00:13:39  <McLeopold> I'm still new to ubuntu
2011-04-07T00:13:57  <McLeopold> I'm used to gentoo, you always roll your own. :)
2011-04-07T00:14:05  <janzert> ahh, I'd be rather surprised if apt doesn't configure it to start
2011-04-07T00:14:58  <janzert> we may need to add some manual configuration changes though but the defaults are probably fine to start with
2011-04-07T00:15:32  <janzert> from the little I've used memcache it seems like the only major knob to twist is how much memory to use
2011-04-07T00:15:38  <janzert> am I remembering right?
2011-04-07T00:15:50  <McLeopold> yep
2011-04-07T00:16:10  <McLeopold> plus telling it of other server to help with the load, but we would only have one
2011-04-07T00:16:39  <janzert> in which case I wouldn't bother worrying with that for now since I've no idea what the final server capability will look like
2011-04-07T00:16:55  <McLeopold> I'm don't know if I'm using php-memcache or php-memcached :/
2011-04-07T00:17:04  <janzert> hehe
2011-04-07T00:17:48  <McLeopold> oh, php-memcached is newer and better
2011-04-07T00:18:39  <janzert> and looks like php-memcache is just the php interface not the actual memcached daemon
2011-04-07T00:19:09  <McLeopold> both php-* are just clients

2011-04-07T00:20:57  <janzert> I saw the libmemcached5 dependency and thought it was daemon itself
2011-04-07T00:21:11  <McLeopold> janzert: do you think you could do the chroot stuff before you can't work on this anymore?
2011-04-07T00:21:30  <janzert> was jbroman not working on it?
2011-04-07T00:21:37  <McLeopold> I don't know
2011-04-07T00:21:40  <janzert> I could try
2011-04-07T00:21:50  <McLeopold> It's been really quite the last 2 weeks
2011-04-07T00:21:57  <McLeopold> I haven't really done much myself
2011-04-07T00:22:09  <janzert> although mainly I was hoping once you had the pieces in place that everything worked end to end I would finish off the setup scripts
2011-04-07T00:22:33  <McLeopold> I'm more worried about chroot than install scripts
2011-04-07T00:22:45  <janzert> it shouldn't take much to do that so should be able to squeeze it in :}
2011-04-07T00:22:58  <janzert> yeah, it's rather a bigger benefit
2011-04-07T00:23:06  <janzert> more work too I think ;)
2011-04-07T00:23:51  <janzert> although even more important is getting the sigstop stuff working (and seeing if it will really work)
2011-04-07T00:24:06  <McLeopold> I'm hoping sigh will look at that.
2011-04-07T00:24:18  <McLeopold> Also, Frontier is worried about buffer stuff with the engine.
2011-04-07T00:24:43  <janzert> was just typing about that :)
2011-04-07T00:25:09  <janzert> the easiest portable way to do it is have a thread for each bots input and output
2011-04-07T00:25:42  <McLeopold> kinda like dmj setup?
2011-04-07T00:25:46  <janzert> so long as we're only going to have 10's and not hundreds of bots in a game it should work just fine
2011-04-07T00:26:04  <janzert> not sure what he did, I've never looked at his tcp server code at all
2011-04-07T00:26:19  <McLeopold> I'm pretty sure you did
2011-04-07T00:26:29  <janzert> I wouldn't be surprised though since it is a common technique
2011-04-07T00:26:32  <McLeopold> there was a comment about mixing threads and processes...
2011-04-07T00:26:57  <janzert> maybe back in the tron timeframe I might have but I don't remember doing it :)
2011-04-07T00:27:51  <janzert> you can look at my arimaa AEI interface for an example of doing it too, although it's not quite what you want so probably not as good of an example if it's also in the tcp server
2011-04-07T00:29:15  <janzert> actually though now that I think about it more I'd be a bit surprised if he is using it in the tcp server
2011-04-07T00:29:38  <janzert> non-blocking socket IO is pretty easy and portable
2011-04-07T00:29:59  <McLeopold> that's where I got the example that you looked at
2011-04-07T00:30:31  <janzert> ok, I don't remember the example now though
2011-04-07T00:31:47  <janzert> basic idea in python is kick of a thread that just reads or writes to the bot and then communicate to it from the main thread using a queue
2011-04-07T00:32:08  <McLeopold> I think the current sandbox does that
2011-04-07T00:32:50  <janzert> I think the old sandbox did for reads, but not writes
2011-04-07T00:33:01  <janzert> not sure if the current one still does
2011-04-07T00:33:40  <McLeopold> yeah, your right, not for writes
2011-04-07T00:35:09  <janzert> yep, looks like
2011-04-07T00:36:24  <janzert> anything else offhand? I've got a headache and looking at code isn't doing it any good
2011-04-07T00:36:37  <janzert> going to take off unless you need something
2011-04-07T00:36:40  <McLeopold> just chroot
2011-04-07T00:37:14  <janzert> yeah, I'll try and look at getting that setup next time I get some time
2011-04-07T00:37:30  <McLeopold> thx
2011-04-07T00:38:09  <janzert> see you around
2011-04-07T00:38:17  <McLeopold> later

2011-04-07T08:03:36  <Frontier> Keth: I get a "Number of orders does not match life span." with that replay.
2011-04-07T08:04:59  <Frontier> but I have an idea. it must be another regression from the json switch
2011-04-07T08:05:22  <Keth> Frontier: no idea either
2011-04-07T08:08:42  <Frontier> ok lets do the math... the line says 'end turn' = 756 and 'conversion turn' = 70
2011-04-07T08:09:29  <Frontier> that makes 686 turns that must be filled with orders (unless this ant survived the game, but you said it went over 1000 turns)
2011-04-07T08:11:32  <Keth> you telling me it's my bot?
2011-04-07T08:11:34  <Keth> blame the negine
2011-04-07T08:11:35  <Keth> engine
2011-04-07T08:11:36  <Keth> :3
2011-04-07T08:11:42  <Frontier> I see 684 commands in the command string. But even if the ant survived that would only allow it to have one less move order than life span
2011-04-07T08:11:48  <Keth> the thing is
2011-04-07T08:11:50  <Keth> I gave you two
2011-04-07T08:11:55  <Keth> the second one has only like 80 turns
2011-04-07T08:12:02  <Keth> and gives same error
2011-04-07T08:12:19  <Keth> see if you can figure out the shorter one
2011-04-07T08:13:16  <Frontier> ok command string has 42 chars
2011-04-07T08:13:18  <Stocha> we'll need some regression tests for then engine somehow

2011-04-07T08:13:41  <Frontier> ant is owned by player from 0 - 44
2011-04-07T08:14:36  <Frontier> same story. somehow the ant lives longer than the engine outputs orders for it
2011-04-07T08:15:43  <Keth> i guess report to whoever does the engine since I honestly have no clue how the repaly information is stored
2011-04-07T08:16:03  <Keth> I just thought I would let you know I often get these with my bot and stocha's
2011-04-07T08:16:51  <Keth> I know it might be bot fault but engine shouldn't output the corrupted replay in first place
2011-04-07T08:18:21  <Frontier> sigh can probably tell you what is going wrong. But I can imagine it happens with other bots, too.
2011-04-07T08:19:00  <Keth> i see
2011-04-07T08:19:20  <Keth> so I talk to sigh and I tell him what?
2011-04-07T08:19:21  <Frontier> Any bot that survives the game has one less order than it should. Or maybe the other way round: The engine tries to artificially prolong the replay.
2011-04-07T08:19:30  <sigh> what's happening?
2011-04-07T08:19:35  <Keth> =D

2011-04-07T08:20:21  <sigh> why are they the old style replays?
2011-04-07T08:20:42  <Keth> that's true
2011-04-07T08:20:49  <Frontier> people like 'em better that way
2011-04-07T08:21:07  <sigh> more to the point, the latest engine can't generate them

2011-04-07T11:34:15  <Frontier> hi
2011-04-07T11:36:58  <Frontier> McLeopold: Yeah, I found that I could not run compiler.py when I wanted to add support for D and noticed that several parts of the code don't fit together as if they were taken from different sources/dates.
2011-04-07T11:40:05  <McLeopold> Frontier: you are right that I did put that together from a few other files.
2011-04-07T11:40:15  <McLeopold> The changes were to support compiling on the workers.
2011-04-07T11:40:35  <McLeopold> Plus, to remove any language data from the database
2011-04-07T11:40:57  <McLeopold> BTW, the leap seconds issue is a total joke :D

2011-04-07T11:42:04  <Frontier> McLeopold: I said it looks like an april fool's joke. The previous version of compiler.py looks more consistent.
2011-04-07T11:43:42  <McLeopold> does the current version break for you?
2011-04-07T11:45:18  <Frontier> It breaks badly. Look at the main method for example. compile_anything requires an argument, but doesn't return a list of results
2011-04-07T11:45:37  <Frontier> (these are two separate issues)
2011-04-07T11:46:03  <McLeopold> oh, I guess I should have removed the main, look at how the worker.py uses it
2011-04-07T11:46:05  <Frontier> It's really a crazy mix.
2011-04-07T11:47:08  <Frontier> hmm, it would be nice if I could have the main back to run tests with it
2011-04-07T11:47:46  <McLeopold> let me fix it then
2011-04-07T11:47:54  <Frontier> also there is still a compile_anything.py that should be removed I think :)
2011-04-07T11:48:20  <Frontier> remove the mysql import while you are at it.

2011-04-07T12:44:15  <McLeopold> janzert/amstan: can you answer a compiling question?
2011-04-07T12:44:24  <amstan> McLeopold: compiling what?
2011-04-07T12:44:25  <amstan> maybe
2011-04-07T12:44:29  <McLeopold> java
2011-04-07T12:44:42  <amstan> ok, try me, but i doubt it
2011-04-07T12:45:03  <McLeopold> in the last contest, did a java submission get compiled to a class file or jar file?
2011-04-07T12:46:35  <amstan> i think it was class
2011-04-07T12:48:08  <McLeopold> that's going to break my detect_language function
2011-04-07T12:54:17  <McLeopold> amstan: language is detected by finding a MyBot.* file, when java is compiled I get a MyBot.class and MyBot.jar file, if I attempt to detect the language again, it fails because MyBot.class could be scala
2011-04-07T12:54:48  <amstan> why are you detecting language after compilation?
2011-04-07T12:54:54  <amstan> shouldn't this be done before?
2011-04-07T12:55:13  <amstan> don't you have the same problem with compiled languages, like Haskell/C
2011-04-07T12:55:19  <McLeopold> because we pulled the language info out of the database
2011-04-07T12:55:23  <amstan> they both get compiled to a binary MyBot
2011-04-07T12:55:57  <McLeopold> So, I need a worker database of submission_id's to languages, or we write a file to the dir that can help us detect
2011-04-07T12:56:11  <McLeopold> if we write a file to the dir, a side affect is people can self declare the language
2011-04-07T12:56:23  <McLeopold> maybe a good thing?
2011-04-07T12:57:27  <McLeopold> Or, I could create a run.sh file after compilation, and not need to detect the language again?
2011-04-07T12:58:10  <McLeopold> amstan: again, if we didn't overwrite, it could have interesting side affects
2011-04-07T12:58:47  <amstan> i think that's fine...
2011-04-07T13:02:12  <Frontier> I thought Java was compiled to .jar, but look at compile_anything.py to know. Anyway why do we keep .o and .class files? If we cleaned them up we could detect the language again. A shell wrapper is ok I guess. I'd prefer to just load the executable for the compiled languages. It is the purist in me…

2011-04-07T14:31:32  <Kender2> I am interested in making it multi-language so I was wondering if the aichallenge software might be a fit?
2011-04-07T14:32:40  <McLeopold> Kender2: it might be
2011-04-07T14:33:48  <Kender2> I'm digging through the repository now, but python is not my strongest language
2011-04-07T14:34:22  <McLeopold> it looks like it depends on 2 java class methods to work
2011-04-07T14:34:39  <McLeopold> It would be some effort to abstract that out into a text protocol for communication
2011-04-07T14:35:04  <Kender2> oh yes, I am thinking about doing a rewrite from scratch
2011-04-07T14:35:12  <McLeopold> Plus, you would need the game engine to interface with the text protocol
2011-04-07T14:35:14  <Kender2> to support multiple programming languages
2011-04-07T14:35:24  <McLeopold> ok
2011-04-07T14:35:33  <Kender2> and then I stumbled upon aichallenge / ai-contest.com
2011-04-07T14:35:44  <McLeopold> Then, first, you want to define the bot communication protocol, then write a game class.
2011-04-07T14:36:25  <McLeopold> look at ants/ants.py as an example of a game engine, also look at ants/game.py as a "interface" of sorts which will work with worker/engine.py
2011-04-07T14:37:31  <McLeopold> As far as a continuous contest goes, we will eventually have an official tcp server, which may suit your needs better, but another ai-context instance would work too.
2011-04-07T14:37:32  <Kender2> I can't figure out if it supports adding new contestants while the manager is running though
2011-04-07T14:37:40  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-04-07T14:37:41  <Kender2> tcp server?
2011-04-07T14:37:58  <McLeopold> You mean the game is always running and you just enter the arena?
2011-04-07T14:38:08  <Kender2> yes
2011-04-07T14:38:36  <Kender2> at bitbath.org a new entry is pitted against all existing bots to determine it's ranking
2011-04-07T14:38:43  <McLeopold> no, this is written for  specific game instances with a set number of players
2011-04-07T14:39:07  <Kender2> so more like a tournament
2011-04-07T14:39:34  <Kender2> ?
2011-04-07T14:40:34  <McLeopold> bitbath is not continuous, it is specific games, so ai-contest code would work
2011-04-07T14:41:05  <McLeopold> yes, we are more like a tournament
2011-04-07T14:41:34  <McLeopold> the worker and manager together control the matchups and maintain the rankings
2011-04-07T14:42:41  <Kender2> yes, I see now how they could be expanded to support my arena-style contest

2011-04-07T14:45:02  <Kender2> ah, then I misunderstood a very basic concept
2011-04-07T14:45:27  <Kender2> I thought the competition (manager/worker) would not start running until everyone had submitted their programds
2011-04-07T14:47:05  <Kender2> Guess I'll have to brush up on my python to understand the code a bit better
2011-04-07T14:47:17  <Kender2> and to be able to contribute
2011-04-07T14:47:51  <McLeopold> it runs continuously, workers are separate servers that request a game to run, then the manager gives them a set of players to put in a game
2011-04-07T14:48:23  <McLeopold> if a new submission is entered, the manager will probably schedule them for a game sooner than later

2011-04-07T18:37:12  <McLeopold> antimatroid: why'd you nuke my .gitignore files?
2011-04-07T18:54:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i got rid of one ages ago so i could add .txt files to the maps directory
2011-04-07T18:54:22  <antimatroid> i'm not aware of doing it since then
2011-04-07T18:54:52  <antimatroid> i can't remember who, but at the time i was like wtf to someone and they realised it was that and said just get rid of it for the moment :)
2011-04-07T19:00:33  <Zannick> you don't need to nuke them, just change them
2011-04-07T19:01:23  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm renamed your .txt to .map
2011-04-07T19:01:29  <McLeopold> *I've*
2011-04-07T19:01:58  <antimatroid> McLeopold: consider adding parameters to map files for the "map generator used"
2011-04-07T19:02:03  <antimatroid> and possibly even for row and col translate
2011-04-07T19:02:16  <McLeopold> YES! I have thought of that.
2011-04-07T19:02:23  <antimatroid> i've gotta head to the uni now
2011-04-07T19:02:33  <McLeopold> I want to provide the seed used so you can regenerate the exact same map if needed.
2011-04-07T19:03:14  <antimatroid> hmmm, for asymmetry i would still prefer if food spawning was the same for each map each game
2011-04-07T19:03:33  <McLeopold> are we talking about spawning?
2011-04-07T19:03:39  <antimatroid> otherwise it's even harder to tell how fair a map is
2011-04-07T19:03:43  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-07T19:03:55  <Zannick> you could embed the seed in the map
2011-04-07T19:04:05  <Zannick> but then the food spawn becomes predictable
2011-04-07T19:04:16  <antimatroid> only predictable if you play the same map over and over
2011-04-07T19:04:29  <antimatroid> in the final contest new maps with seeds can be used
2011-04-07T19:04:36  <McLeopold> I think we are talking about 2 things.  Antimatroid wants to give hints to the engine for best food method, I want reproducible map generation.
2011-04-07T19:04:47  <Zannick> oh, and not provide the seed to the players
2011-04-07T19:04:56  <Zannick> i dunno why i thought that

2011-04-07T19:09:42  <McLeopold> TLDR
2011-04-07T19:10:24  <janzert> antimatroid: btw .gitignore just tells git what to ignore by default, you can still explicitly git add ignored-file
2011-04-07T19:13:35  <antimatroid> my inbox has over 600 unread emails
