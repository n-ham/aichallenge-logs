2010-12-15T00:34:36  <HeelToe> i don't think the server is running, but thanks anyway
2010-12-15T00:35:04  <antimatroid> there's probably no one to pair you wtih :P
2010-12-15T00:36:04  <HeelToe> yeah, figured
2010-12-15T00:36:39  <antimatroid> turn up during a contest and you will have plenty of competition
2010-12-15T00:37:02  <HeelToe> yeah, i made a bot, but it crashed on their system, while working fine on mine :/
2010-12-15T00:37:13  <antimatroid> c++?
2010-12-15T00:37:16  <HeelToe> pytho
2010-12-15T00:37:17  <antimatroid> i had that happen to me a few times
2010-12-15T00:37:17  <HeelToe> n
2010-12-15T00:37:22  <antimatroid> my final bot was all good though
2010-12-15T00:37:35  <HeelToe> did you find out why the other ones crashed?
2010-12-15T00:37:45  <antimatroid> nope
2010-12-15T00:37:55  <HeelToe> and yeah, I completely started over cause my submitted bot was crap
2010-12-15T00:38:14  <HeelToe> that sucks doesn't it, the mysterious failure of crashing every time...
2010-12-15T00:38:35  <antimatroid> i am extremely disappointed at how hard it is to create a process inside a program
2010-12-15T00:38:56  <Zannick> so easy!
2010-12-15T00:38:58  <Zannick> fork()
2010-12-15T00:39:03  <Zannick> >.>
2010-12-15T00:39:14  <Zannick> or with python, subprocess.Popen
2010-12-15T00:39:23  <HeelToe> like a thread?
2010-12-15T00:44:47  <antimatroid> Zannick: i don't know how to do it?
2010-12-15T00:44:47  <antimatroid> Can i create a variable like thing that is a process, where i can just input/output things from it like any other stream?
2010-12-15T00:44:50  <antimatroid> that would be coolest
2010-12-15T00:45:51  <Zannick> so, i'd have to look up exactly how that works, too
2010-12-15T00:46:00  <Zannick> but the subprocess module is what you want
2010-12-15T00:46:42  <Zannick> subprocess.Popen is a class that has stdin and stdout pipes that you can input/output to/from
2010-12-15T00:46:56  <Zannick> you can look at aicontest's own user_sadbox.py for an example
2010-12-15T00:47:33  <antimatroid> yeah okay, another option is to use boost
2010-12-15T00:47:42  <antimatroid> but then people need to have that installed, which i don't like
2010-12-15T00:48:10  <Zannick> for c/c++ it's way more complicated
2010-12-15T00:48:20  <Zannick> cause you can fork(), but that's a new process
2010-12-15T00:48:38  <antimatroid> http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/process/boost_process/usage.html#boost_process.usage.interprocess_communication
2010-12-15T00:48:51  <Zannick> sure
2010-12-15T00:48:57  * Zannick not familiar with boost
2010-12-15T00:49:01  <antimatroid> neither :P

2010-12-15T09:05:43  <delt0r> antimatroid1, Why don't you use some of the C++ engines from the last comp. they have the whole process thing done for you
2010-12-15T09:06:16  <delt0r> also perhaps using python would be quicker... Its not a given we/they will go for ants as the final game
2010-12-15T09:06:25  <antimatroid1> delt0r: i've looked at albets, it's messier than i like, i'm working on a process struct now using boost that i can just use string streams to interact with
2010-12-15T09:06:55  <antimatroid1> i'm quite interested in getting this process struct written now anyway, i'm sure i'll find a use for it eventually

2010-12-15T20:40:20  <Cyndre> so its going to be an ant game like planet wars?
2010-12-15T20:44:27  <antimatroid> Cyndre: it's just a possible option
2010-12-15T20:44:36  <antimatroid> and there are 2 considerably different versions of antwars
2010-12-15T20:45:21  <antimatroid> i've finally got processes communicating one way in c++
2010-12-15T20:45:27  <Cyndre> excellent article - http://www.jasonshen.com/2010/winning-isnt-normal/
2010-12-15T20:45:29  <antimatroid> it doesn't seem to like going bidirectionally atm
2010-12-15T20:45:59  <Cyndre> Im starting a redisgn of my bots brain :)
2010-12-15T20:46:59  <Cyndre> my irc bot that is - anyone care if he sits in here and learns from you?  it only talks on specific keywords
2010-12-15T20:47:28  <antimatroid> depends how common those words are :P
2010-12-15T20:47:35  <antimatroid> i don't think anyone would mind too much atm
2010-12-15T20:47:43  <antimatroid> possibly not leave it in here when a contest is on
2010-12-15T20:48:36  <Cyndre> scoreme - displays your sentence score, askim - ask the bot a question and returns a list of most likely answers, explainword word - breaks it down to noun etc

2010-12-15T20:50:38  <Cyndre> scoreme
2010-12-15T20:50:38  <CyndreBot_> Cyndre, your current score is 106.
2010-12-15T20:50:58  <antimatroid> scoreme
2010-12-15T20:50:58  <CyndreBot_> antimatroid, your current score is 116.
2010-12-15T20:51:01  <antimatroid> yeah :P
2010-12-15T20:51:14  <antimatroid> is that number of chars read?
2010-12-15T20:51:17  <antimatroid> scoreme
2010-12-15T20:51:17  <CyndreBot_> antimatroid, your current score is 101.
2010-12-15T20:51:21  <antimatroid> no :s
2010-12-15T20:51:53  <Zannick> scoreme
2010-12-15T20:51:53  <CyndreBot_> Zannick, your current score is 160.
2010-12-15T20:52:00  <Zannick> B)
2010-12-15T20:52:01  <Cyndre> its based on your sentence structure and what the bot already knows.  Every word pair is evaluated, assigned a score, and used to score you.  If your score is less then the word pair, your score goes up, word pair score goes down and vice versa
2010-12-15T20:52:31  <Zannick> interesting
2010-12-15T20:52:45  <Cyndre> want to change it to word triplets though
2010-12-15T20:53:07  <Zannick> and this is to seed a markov generator?
2010-12-15T20:53:12  <Zannick> yeah, that's pretty interesting
2010-12-15T20:53:19  <Cyndre> no, to decide how to rank memorys
2010-12-15T20:53:59  <Zannick> well, it seems like an interesting idea for a markov generator
2010-12-15T20:54:05  <Cyndre> ie - the higher the score, the higher the respect for the person and more likely to find things they say important
2010-12-15T20:54:15  <Cyndre> askbot who is the president of the united states of america
2010-12-15T20:54:32  <CyndreBot_> obama, people, has, were, many, help, their, any, bush, over, black, doesn, does, person, also, us, because, change, world, thats, time, still, make, american, than, based, war, our, years, being, wes
2010-12-15T20:54:50  <Zannick> i know a guy named wes :)
2010-12-15T20:55:09  <Cyndre> so the score is how it learns from you.  It stops dumb people from teaching it and in fact he will down mod things they say
2010-12-15T20:55:43  <Cyndre> and then it will also use the word pair scores durring sentence generation
2010-12-15T20:56:23  <sigh> scoreme
2010-12-15T20:56:23  <CyndreBot_> sigh, your current score is 34.
2010-12-15T20:56:33  <sigh> it doesn't like me :(

2010-12-15T20:57:36  <Zannick> the next game will be "play" or "play action"

2010-12-15T21:02:10  <Cyndre> explainword suggest

2010-12-15T23:15:01  <Cyndre> if total_wordpair_score/total_wordpairs > wordpair_score    wordpair_score -= total_wordpair_score/total_wordpairs   or something
2010-12-15T23:15:01  <antimatroid> fputs doesn't seem to work, it demands i input it from actual std::in
2010-12-15T23:21:58  <Cyndre> http://book.chinaunix.net/special/ebook/addisonWesley/APUE2/0201433079/ch15lev1sec3.html   not sure if it helps, it just gives the std::in method
2010-12-15T23:22:48  <Cyndre> are you flushing the buffer with your fputs?
2010-12-15T23:24:02  <antimatroid> i am
2010-12-15T23:24:07  <antimatroid> still doesn't seem to do anything
2010-12-15T23:24:16  <Cyndre> http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread329170.html    is this helpful?
2010-12-15T23:25:33  <antimatroid> not really, forking creates a child process of the same file
2010-12-15T23:25:44  <antimatroid> i need processes of different files with input/output streams between them
2010-12-15T23:26:12  <antimatroid> i'm trying to get it all into a process struct with no extra libraries so i never have to think about it again
2010-12-15T23:28:21  <SmkMnstr> whats question?
2010-12-15T23:29:21  <SmkMnstr> if you want to both read/write from process you start's stdin/stdout you cant use popen i guess
2010-12-15T23:29:51  <SmkMnstr> popen only for unidirectional, dumping output to prog, or reading input from prog
2010-12-15T23:30:36  <SmkMnstr> for bidiretional you have to do it manually with seris of pipe(), dup2() and fork() / execve()
2010-12-15T23:31:44  <antimatroid> people keep saying use fork?
2010-12-15T23:31:52  <antimatroid> how do i fork a process that isn't the same file?
2010-12-15T23:32:02  <antimatroid> i thought it just forked a child process that is the same
2010-12-15T23:32:07  <Zannick> it does
2010-12-15T23:32:07  <SmkMnstr> you fork THEN exec
2010-12-15T23:32:13  <Zannick> namely "fork returns twice"
2010-12-15T23:32:17  <SmkMnstr> thats what popen() does
2010-12-15T23:32:27  <Zannick> but "exec never returns"
2010-12-15T23:32:44  <SmkMnstr> well put Zannick
2010-12-15T23:32:57  <antimatroid> hmmm, i don't get it, is there a page that explains the two things?
2010-12-15T23:33:06  <antimatroid> i swear google is failing me miserably
2010-12-15T23:33:06  <Zannick> generally you see pid = fork(); if (pid == 0) { /* child */ exec( ... ); }
2010-12-15T23:33:38  <Zannick> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork-exec
2010-12-15T23:33:43  <SmkMnstr> its the bidirectional IO control of a program what youre trying to achieve?
2010-12-15T23:34:06  <Zannick> most of my knowledge of this comes from the systems classes i took at college
2010-12-15T23:34:20  * antimatroid didn't take any such classes 
2010-12-15T23:34:28  <Zannick> they were required for me
2010-12-15T23:34:33  <Zannick> maybe you just haven't yet
2010-12-15T23:34:38  <antimatroid> my uni comp department is worse than bad :P
2010-12-15T23:34:47  <antimatroid> i graduated yesterday :P
2010-12-15T23:34:54  <SmkMnstr> i was a bigtime unix programmer in 90s :)
2010-12-15T23:34:55  <Zannick> or you didn't go to a good school like cmu ;)
2010-12-15T23:35:01  <antimatroid> i also did the bare minimum to finish a cs major
2010-12-15T23:35:09  <Zannick> i see
2010-12-15T23:36:26  <antimatroid> (i did economics and maths majors which filled the rest of my time)
2010-12-15T23:36:38  <Zannick> triple major?
2010-12-15T23:36:43  <Zannick> i doubled in math and that was tought
2010-12-15T23:36:45  <antimatroid> anyway, i'ma go get some subway then try to do it with fork/exec etc. and if that fails possibly give up
2010-12-15T23:36:46  <Zannick> tough *
2010-12-15T23:36:59  <antimatroid> yep, lots of 5 unit semesters
2010-12-15T23:36:59  <Zannick> but i still took the hardest cs class (Operating Systems) and got a B
2010-12-15T23:37:14  <antimatroid> my hardest 2 classes were analysis 3 and algebra 4
2010-12-15T23:37:18  <antimatroid> algebra 3**
2010-12-15T23:37:30  <Zannick> that's very vague
2010-12-15T23:38:02  <antimatroid> analysis was intros to metric, normed and hilbert spaces, algebra 3 was more on group and ring theory from second year
2010-12-15T23:38:17  <Zannick> ah, those are similar to one of my classes
2010-12-15T23:38:20  <antimatroid> i already did a real and complex analysis unit before that, for some reason my uni does it the other way to most others
2010-12-15T23:38:40  <Zannick> termed "math studies" and was about 5 courses crammed into the time equivalent of two
2010-12-15T23:38:51  <antimatroid> but i get to do lots of analysis and algebra next year, i'm not doing a single applied unit :)
2010-12-15T23:38:54  <Zannick> over a full year
2010-12-15T23:39:02  <antimatroid> sounds nice
2010-12-15T23:39:04  <Zannick> have fun with that :)
2010-12-15T23:39:23  <Zannick> i'm done with school, now i have a full-time job
2010-12-15T23:39:39  <antimatroid> i'm torn about doing a phd or going off to work
2010-12-15T23:39:48  <antimatroid> but i'm at least doing honours in maths next year and maybe masters after that
2010-12-15T23:40:01  <antimatroid> phd would probably be in economics or cs with game theory
2010-12-15T23:40:17  <SmkMnstr> heh i can help w the pipe thing
2010-12-15T23:40:18  <Zannick> pretty cool
2010-12-15T23:40:23  <SmkMnstr> its funny because it could take u a really long time
2010-12-15T23:40:32  <SmkMnstr> but i can probably make it in like 15 min
2010-12-15T23:40:35  <SmkMnstr> its one of those rare times
2010-12-15T23:40:42  <SmkMnstr> having a memorized contra code pays off
2010-12-15T23:41:33  <antimatroid> SmkMnstr: how long are you going to be around?
2010-12-15T23:41:48  <SmkMnstr> awhile
2010-12-15T23:41:52  <antimatroid> i might try and get your help in a bit, i just need to go get some subway
2010-12-15T23:41:59  <antimatroid> i'm staving and it's 3 40pm :P
2010-12-15T23:41:59  <SmkMnstr> cool ill probably be here when u get back
2010-12-15T23:42:22  <SmkMnstr> actually i remmeber there is even more stuff u have to do to use stdio
2010-12-15T23:43:28  <SmkMnstr> easier to just read() and write() to fds than to use fgets fputs fwrite
2010-12-15T23:43:55  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm realising that
2010-12-15T23:44:09  <antimatroid> i'll clean up what i'm trying to do when i get back then get your help
2010-12-15T23:44:13  <antimatroid> it's a bit of a mess atm
2010-12-15T23:44:41  <SmkMnstr> cool
