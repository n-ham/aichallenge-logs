2011-05-24T08:28:07  <antimatroid1> i'm claiming that to be the most used

2011-05-24T09:23:39  <mcstar> ive seen almost every video they showed in the clip
2011-05-24T09:24:52  <mcstar> (not sure thats a good or a bad thing, but im not obsessed with cats, in fact i have dogs)
2011-05-24T09:31:52  <antimatroid1> mcstar: http://i.imgur.com/qp4Cf.png
2011-05-24T09:31:56  <antimatroid1> i just spent way too long making that
2011-05-24T09:32:00  <antimatroid1> i want a physical one
2011-05-24T09:33:39  <mcstar> whoa thats your idea of the multiplayer version of th cube?
2011-05-24T09:34:23  <antimatroid1> no, that was just an alternate idea for a rubix cube
2011-05-24T09:34:49  <mcstar> how dou you intend to color it?
2011-05-24T09:35:44  <mcstar> 30 colors is too much
2011-05-24T09:35:50  <antimatroid1> no it's not
2011-05-24T09:35:55  <mcstar> i know only 5-6 colors
2011-05-24T09:36:06  <antimatroid1> i'm a mathematician
2011-05-24T09:36:15  <antimatroid1> as far as i'm concerned there's an infinite number of colours
2011-05-24T09:36:16  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-05-24T09:37:10  <mcstar> im not talking about colours, im talking about colors
2011-05-24T09:37:17  <mcstar> hehe
2011-05-24T09:37:43  <mcstar> of course you could print the alphabet with number on the faces
2011-05-24T09:37:45  <antimatroid1> i'm australian :P
2011-05-24T09:37:52  <antimatroid1> or a number :P
2011-05-24T09:38:05  <mcstar> no, it has to be 1 character
2011-05-24T09:38:18  <antimatroid1> yeah, each face gets a unique number, 1-30
2011-05-24T09:38:37  <antimatroid1> you could start adding more cubes on so that you could transform the object into different things as well
2011-05-24T09:38:47  <antimatroid1> ie. the object isn't symmetric under all rotations

2011-05-24T09:39:58  <mcstar> im sure that i cant conceive of the group structure of your cube
2011-05-24T09:40:16  <mcstar> the original is complex enough
2011-05-24T09:40:23  <mcstar> btw can u do it?
2011-05-24T09:40:41  <mcstar> i can make it in 2.5 minutes
2011-05-24T09:40:52  <mcstar> cause my fingers are slow
2011-05-24T09:40:52  <antimatroid1> nah, never bothered to learn
2011-05-24T09:41:13  <antimatroid1> one could write a program to get the group structure, no idea if i could run it though
2011-05-24T09:42:06  <mcstar> i was bad at group theory, i studied it only to get through the exam
2011-05-24T09:42:29  <mcstar> i hated those character tables
2011-05-24T09:43:31  <antimatroid1> group theory is awesome
2011-05-24T09:43:45  <mcstar> i can see why someone likes it
2011-05-24T09:44:02  <mcstar> it just took me too much of an effort to study it
2011-05-24T09:45:07  <mcstar> now back to work, i have to watch the end of SGU

2011-05-24T16:19:12  <tomh> hey
2011-05-24T16:19:24  <tomh> is the Ants game ready to develop against?
2011-05-24T16:20:50  <demerzel> develop against?  not sure what you mean by that exactly but the game itself exists on github
2011-05-24T16:21:01  <tomh> to create a bot for it
2011-05-24T16:22:00  <demerzel> yes
2011-05-24T16:22:05  <demerzel> there are starter packages etc
2011-05-24T16:22:26  <tomh> yeah I saw that, but it said winter 2011, so I thought it might be still under heavy development
2011-05-24T16:22:52  <demerzel> it is
2011-05-24T16:22:55  <demerzel> but the basic game is there
2011-05-24T16:23:02  <tomh> ok
2011-05-24T16:23:02  <demerzel> the game itself won't change much
2011-05-24T16:23:06  <demerzel> just the site etc is under dev
2011-05-24T16:23:13  <tomh> and when is the competition deadline?
2011-05-24T16:23:17  <demerzel> idk
2011-05-24T16:23:33  <tomh> ok
2011-05-24T16:28:09  <amstan> tomh: it didn't start.. so.. you're good
2011-05-24T16:29:49  <demerzel> amstan: worker still stalled?
2011-05-24T16:30:01  <amstan> demerzel: yes, bug mcleopold pls
2011-05-24T16:30:19  <demerzel> contestbot: seen mcleopold
2011-05-24T16:30:19  <contestbot> demerzel: mcleopold was last seen in #aichallenge 21 hours, 46 minutes, and 25 seconds ago: <McLeopold> amstan: I think my memcache code is crappy and useless
2011-05-24T16:30:25  <demerzel> yea that was the last one
2011-05-24T16:30:34  <demerzel> got a 'giving up' vibe :(
2011-05-24T16:30:45  <demerzel> hopefully not tho
2011-05-24T16:30:59  <jmcarthur> winter? so there is quite some time before the contest then?
2011-05-24T16:31:07  * berak would like a debate, why it's taking so long  for take-off,       ppl, you're half a year late now, already !
2011-05-24T16:31:10  <jmcarthur> i might be able to participate after all if so
2011-05-24T16:31:33  <amstan> berak: well, nobody's really into coding the backend
2011-05-24T16:31:37  <amstan> berak: we need more coders
2011-05-24T16:31:41  <demerzel> i would be if it wasn't all python lol
2011-05-24T16:31:46  <demerzel> i'd tolerate php
2011-05-24T16:31:47  <berak> ;)
2011-05-24T16:32:32  <demerzel> python: literally the only language i won't touch with a 10-foot pole
2011-05-24T16:32:43  <demerzel> sorry
2011-05-24T16:32:46  <amstan> demerzel: like me with c# and java?
2011-05-24T16:32:59  <demerzel> idk you do seem progress-resistant ;)
2011-05-24T16:33:28  <amstan> since when was c# progress? i see it more as chains
2011-05-24T16:33:49  <demerzel> i'm not even gonna dignify that lol
2011-05-24T16:34:12  <demerzel> i think its funny linux users like python it's like the cmoplete oppoiste of my mindset
2011-05-24T16:34:13  <jmcarthur> since when is php progressive compared to python?
2011-05-24T16:34:25  <demerzel> i want complete control over my os but not my coding
2011-05-24T16:34:32  <demerzel> it should 'just do it'
2011-05-24T16:35:28  <jmcarthur> i mean, i'm with you that python is not a nicely progressive language, but php does not stand in contrast to it
2011-05-24T16:35:39  <demerzel> no i was giving him shit about not liking c# / java
2011-05-24T16:36:05  <demerzel> python is a weird association to linux but it's there for some reason
2011-05-24T16:36:07  <jmcarthur> java is one of the most, err. regressive languages i know. c# is alright at least
2011-05-24T16:36:35  <demerzel> they're syntactically very similar but c# is better implemented because it was planned that way
2011-05-24T16:36:48  <demerzel> otoh java 'theoretically' is open-platform
2011-05-24T16:36:52  <demerzel> but with mono existing it's a moot point imo
2011-05-24T16:36:52  <jmcarthur> and was actually designed to be better than the languages it competes with
2011-05-24T16:36:58  <demerzel> yea
2011-05-24T16:37:01  <jmcarthur> the only new thing java introduced to the mainstream was GC
2011-05-24T16:37:18  <jmcarthur> which of course was already around
2011-05-24T16:37:22  <jmcarthur> just not in a "fast" language
2011-05-24T16:37:27  <tomh> amstan: what kind of backend stuff is not done?
2011-05-24T16:37:35  <jbroman> jmcarthur: The JVM is apparently rather nice.
2011-05-24T16:37:43  <jbroman> (It's arguably a byproduct of Java.)
2011-05-24T16:37:45  <jmcarthur> jbroman: for anything that is not interactive, yes
2011-05-24T16:37:57  <jmcarthur> the JIT is amazing
2011-05-24T16:38:09  <jmcarthur> and the GC fairly nice
2011-05-24T16:38:13  <demerzel> the thing that ties the whole run games/upload/move compiled/everything else is constantly broken
2011-05-24T16:38:18  <demerzel> afaik the actual components work fine
2011-05-24T16:38:32  <tomh> I can develop the bot in any language I want right?
2011-05-24T16:38:39  <amstan> tomh: a bunch of bugs, and mcleopold and janzert are the only ones familiar with the code
2011-05-24T16:38:46  <amstan> tomh: so we're at their mercy
2011-05-24T16:38:51  <tomh> ok
2011-05-24T16:39:16  <tomh> its written in such way, that no one else could be familirized with the code?
2011-05-24T16:39:26  <demerzel> amstan is lazy
2011-05-24T16:40:15  * berak sees now, what 'we need more coders!' means..
2011-05-24T16:40:26  <demerzel> 500 lines of python which is 'really easy to read'?  might as well be greek

2011-05-24T16:42:40  <demerzel> idgi
2011-05-24T16:42:46  <jbroman> tomh: Most common languages, yes.
2011-05-24T16:42:52  <tomh> haskell?\
2011-05-24T16:42:54  <demerzel> if you admit c/c++ extensions would run much faster why not just write teh whole thing in c/c++
2011-05-24T16:42:59  <demerzel> yep
2011-05-24T16:43:05  <demerzel> they even already have a haskell starter package
2011-05-24T16:43:09  <tomh> ok good
2011-05-24T16:43:33  <jbroman> demerzel: Some things are faster to write in raw assembly than C/C++. Why would you not write the whole thing in assembly?
2011-05-24T16:43:55  <demerzel> i'm pretty sure the variety and amount of those things are much smaller in scope if not microscopic in comparison

2011-05-24T16:44:27  <jbroman> The same argument holds. People who use higher level languages do so because they prefer the convenient facilities that provides, usually at the cost of some measure of performance.
2011-05-24T16:45:06  <mcstar> i thought this debate was settled when fortran/lisp was created
2011-05-24T16:45:12  <mcstar> 50 years ago
2011-05-24T16:45:26  <tomh> haskell is also quite performant
2011-05-24T16:45:50  <demerzel> i want to learn lisp
2011-05-24T16:45:56  <demerzel> maybe i'll try this year
2011-05-24T16:46:01  <mcstar> +1
2011-05-24T16:46:12  <tomh> if you can type ( and ), you are halfway there
2011-05-24T16:46:34  <mcstar> tomh is being sarcastic
2011-05-24T16:46:56  <mcstar> i want a straight answer guys:
2011-05-24T16:47:03  <jmcarthur> jbroman: i don't believe that performance must necessarily be sacrificed for a higher level language, although it is definitely not going to be fast for early iterations of the compiler
2011-05-24T16:47:07  <mcstar> is it possible that the contest really will only start in the winter?
2011-05-24T16:48:53  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Well, some facilities due inevitably sacrifice performance (e.g. it's probably impossible to write GC that is never slower than well-written malloc/free code). Certainly some may be achievable without loss of performance (and I know you're not too subtly talking about GHC here). But those facilities are still the reason that people choose languages like Python.
2011-05-24T16:49:09  <jbroman> s/due in/do in/
2011-05-24T16:49:18  <jmcarthur> i'm actually not talking about ghc at all
2011-05-24T16:50:25  <jbroman> Hmm, OK.
2011-05-24T16:50:30  <jmcarthur> jbroman: regions are often faster than malloc/free
2011-05-24T16:50:44  <berak> another language war won't make it happen.
2011-05-24T16:50:58  <jmcarthur> by that i mean faster than is at all possible with malloc/free unless you write a full blown regions library on top of it
2011-05-24T16:51:40  <jbroman> jmcarthur: I don't really care about the speed of the allocation algorithm. I meant that the GC will sometimes do operations that might be avoidable with foreknowledge of the program. And it was only an example.
2011-05-24T16:51:42  <jmcarthur> region inference isn't well-studied enough to avoid some explicitness in your code though, unfortunately
2011-05-24T16:52:01  * amstan points that speed of execution is not the only thing that matters
2011-05-24T16:52:05  <demerzel> even faster is not having to use malloc/free by careful design
2011-05-24T16:52:14  <jmcarthur> jbroman: no i understood your point. i just mean there are alternatives to gc
2011-05-24T16:52:19  <jmcarthur> regions being one
2011-05-24T16:52:20  <amstan> i believe speed of developing is also important in this contest at least
2011-05-24T16:52:38  <demerzel> its really not though we have like 5 months to develop nothing but pure math logic

2011-05-24T16:54:09  <demerzel> amstan: stdio (already written) and just pure logic ie math operation and conditions is all that's left
2011-05-24T16:54:11  <jmcarthur> jbroman: but since you brought up ghc, i feel i need to point out that ghc is *not* anywhere near where i think it could be. there are several optimizations glaringly missing and questionable design decisions making other kinds of optimizations impossible. even some of haskell's design decisions play a part here, most of which superficially make haskell appear *lower* level
2011-05-24T16:54:23  <demerzel> dev time is not really a factor since any language is going ot be similar in time invested
2011-05-24T16:54:37  <demerzel> higher level languages extract concepts like gui / input etc which is useful but not necessary in this
2011-05-24T16:54:46  <jbroman> demerzel: That is debatable. If that were provable true nobody would use high-level languages.
2011-05-24T16:54:52  <jbroman> s/provable/provably/
2011-05-24T16:55:01  <jmcarthur> demerzel: i strongly disagree with that
2011-05-24T16:55:26  <demerzel> how much difference can there really be between languages on 'if h(n) < then'
2011-05-24T16:55:34  <jbroman> For instance, a whole class of memory allocation bugs do not occur in some higher-level languages. Thus you do not need to spend time debugging those issues.
2011-05-24T16:55:35  <demerzel> in terms of dev time not syntax
2011-05-24T16:55:39  <jmcarthur> higher level languages give you a richer vocabulary in general
2011-05-24T16:55:47  <jmcarthur> demerzel: i'm not just talking about syntax sugar
2011-05-24T16:55:49  <demerzel> jbroman: your dimensions are static
2011-05-24T16:55:56  <demerzel> given to you on turn1
2011-05-24T16:56:02  <demerzel> you don't even have to malloc
2011-05-24T16:56:17  <jmcarthur> demerzel: you were only talking about syntax, but let's analyze your example there (if then)...
2011-05-24T16:56:18  <jbroman> demerzel: That's only one example.
2011-05-24T16:56:46  <jbroman> demerzel: If you end up writing an identical program switching one syntax for another, sure, you won't notice much of a difference.
2011-05-24T16:56:59  <jmcarthur> demerzel: other ways to do it are pattern matching, which gives you a more powerful operation in fewer lines of code, allowing branches to have a context sensitivity which if statements simply can't mimick at all
2011-05-24T16:57:22  <demerzel> but you're giong to want to optimize that as much as possible anyway given the large amount of possibilities that exist
2011-05-24T16:57:52  <jmcarthur> demerzel: if statements also require booleans. with pattern matching, you can get a truth value which also carries its own proof, and then you can use that proof in the branches
2011-05-24T16:58:09  <demerzel> what do you mean by pattern matching?
2011-05-24T16:58:27  <jmcarthur> well i could give a simple example, but it won't show its full potential
2011-05-24T16:58:27  <demerzel> saying it brings regex to mind which i don't think is what you mean
2011-05-24T16:58:33  <jmcarthur> no, not regex
2011-05-24T16:58:57  <jmcarthur> case foo bar of Nothing -> <do stuff>; Just x -> <use x to do other stuff>
2011-05-24T16:59:07  <jmcarthur> demerzel: that as opposed to checking for null before using x
2011-05-24T16:59:20  * berak just encountered a (python) syntax err in turn 100, a c-compiler would have got that even before startup
2011-05-24T16:59:27  <jmcarthur> demerzel: in other words, because you obtain x through pattern matching, it's impossible to use x if it's null
2011-05-24T16:59:46  <jmcarthur> it's not even syntactically expressible to use a null value
2011-05-24T16:59:52  <demerzel> but you could just initialize x with a value that's impossible to arrive at
2011-05-24T17:00:07  <demerzel> guess i don't understand the example
2011-05-24T17:00:09  <jmcarthur> but that's just a hack
2011-05-24T17:00:23  <demerzel> true but i don't understand the significance of null
2011-05-24T17:00:42  <amstan> berak: python syntax errors are detected from the start, unless you're doing evals
2011-05-24T17:01:27  <jmcarthur> okay how about this... open a source file, find the first if statement in the file, and tell me what you are using it for. nine times out of ten, pattern matching and a high level data structure can do it more nicely
2011-05-24T17:01:47  <jmcarthur> not just more nicely, that is
2011-05-24T17:01:53  <jmcarthur> more safely
2011-05-24T17:02:18  <jbroman> demerzel: Suppose you have an object, Person, who maintains a pointer to another object, Company. You might try to do "person->company->name" to get the company name, forgetting to check the possibility that the company field is null.
2011-05-24T17:02:19  <jbroman> In Haskell, you cannot do this because the field is of type "Maybe Company", so you are forced to consider the possibility by the language.
2011-05-24T17:03:01  <jbroman> Pattern matching provides a syntax which makes doing this not painful.
2011-05-24T17:03:11  <demerzel> ok i understand that but how is that different than null checking
2011-05-24T17:03:21  <jmcarthur> it's different in a few ways
2011-05-24T17:03:31  <jmcarthur> 1. The compiler prevents you from accidentally using a null value.
2011-05-24T17:03:54  <jmcarthur> 2. The synax gives you a "denullified" value to use which you are guaranteed is not null.
2011-05-24T17:04:14  <jmcarthur> 3. The syntax makes it impossible to use a denullified value without having first checked it via pattern matching.
2011-05-24T17:04:36  <jmcarthur> pattern matching is actually much more general than this. this is just a very simple example
2011-05-24T17:05:06  <demerzel> how is that different than initializing to a non-null value that is either that min/max or unreachable by calculation?
2011-05-24T17:05:13  <jmcarthur> not only is this higher level, but it can also make your code faster because you don't have to perform redundant null checks in different functions
2011-05-24T17:05:15  <demerzel> depending on application
2011-05-24T17:05:41  <demerzel> what is the 'denullified' value, do you define it or is it language-wide
2011-05-24T17:05:53  <jmcarthur> because your proposal does not prevent you from misusing it and does not give you a syntactically obvious indication that you need to check for null
2011-05-24T17:06:06  <jmcarthur> the denullified value is x in my example code
2011-05-24T17:06:21  <jmcarthur> the possibly-null value is "foo bar"
2011-05-24T17:06:48  <jmcarthur> once you have x you can use it however you want and not have to ever think about the possiblity of it being null
2011-05-24T17:07:15  <jmcarthur> your "special value" proposal does not have this property
2011-05-24T17:07:26  <demerzel> cool ty gonna look into haskell - i do know of some exchange companies that use it
2011-05-24T17:07:38  <demerzel> well yea i guess it depends on how much you trust the coder haha
2011-05-24T17:08:11  <jmcarthur> it goes a lot deeper than this though, as i said. overall, haskell's type system makes it much easier to reason about your code.
2011-05-24T17:08:36  <jmcarthur> jbroman: it also makes it easier for the compiler to reason about your code. that's the direction i was intending to push when i said high level languages don't necessarily have to be slower than low level languages
2011-05-24T17:09:35  <jbroman> jmcarthur: True in theory, but extremely difficult in practice. But point taken.
2011-05-24T17:10:24  <demerzel> dont get wrong i wouldn't even think about using iso c in a gui app or something similar
2011-05-24T17:10:35  <demerzel> it was just super nice to have something like this where i don't have to think at all about user interaction
2011-05-24T17:11:10  <demerzel> seemed an optimal choice because all the stuff that is abstracted in other languages really isn't part of it
2011-05-24T17:11:29  <demerzel> but i only know class-based languages and a handful of others i have never touched haskell/lisp/etc
2011-05-24T17:11:35  <jmcarthur> i don't think it's that difficult in practice. i think the problem is that so far people have been too afraid to continue purifying (in the sense of purely functional) languages. there are many ways to bring it further. i think turing completeness is vastly overrated, for example. dropping that in certain ways makes crazier optimizations much easier, just as purity makes certain optimizations a
2011-05-24T17:11:35  <demerzel> c-based i meant
2011-05-24T17:11:36  <jmcarthur> lot easier too
2011-05-24T17:12:28  <jmcarthur> i guess i was due for my functional languages conversation in #aichallenge
2011-05-24T17:13:15  <demerzel> iso c isn't a functional language?
2011-05-24T17:13:40  <jbroman> demerzel: I wouldn't describe it as one, no.
2011-05-24T17:13:41  <jmcarthur> tough question to answer honestly. C is not functional in the sense that i am talking about
2011-05-24T17:14:15  <jmcarthur> since functional is such an ambiguous word, i've been using "denotative" in its place
2011-05-24T17:14:28  <jmcarthur> a language is denotative if it satisfies the following criteria:
2011-05-24T17:14:44  <jmcarthur> 1. Expressions are made up of subexpressions.
2011-05-24T17:15:13  <jmcarthur> 2. Each subexpression has a well-defined meaning all by itself (a value, mathematical object, function, etc.).
2011-05-24T17:15:29  <jmcarthur> 3. The meaning of an expression depends only on the meanings of its subexpressions.
2011-05-24T17:15:37  <jmcarthur> C does not satisfy that criteria.
2011-05-24T17:16:17  <jmcarthur> nor does Haskell, by a very strict interpretation
2011-05-24T17:16:39  <demerzel> i will admit i'm not very knowledgeable at the academic side of coding lol
2011-05-24T17:16:42  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Do you consider the IO monad a violation of that?
2011-05-24T17:16:47  <demerzel> didnt' go to school for cs at least
2011-05-24T17:16:52  <jmcarthur> the IO monad does not have a well-defined meaning

2011-05-24T18:02:17  <McLeopold> everything
2011-05-24T18:02:35  <McLeopold> I don't want to be the point of failure
2011-05-24T18:02:40  <amstan> the website seems to be working, mostly
2011-05-24T18:02:44  <amstan> the worker is the broken one
2011-05-24T18:04:09  <McLeopold> I was fixing up my misguided attempts at improved caching

2011-05-24T18:15:07  <McLeopold> you mean, the part where it suddenly fires off hundreds of fast games in a row?
2011-05-24T18:15:23  <amstan> yes, but they're not games at all, mostly errors
2011-05-24T18:15:48  <McLeopold> no, still broken
2011-05-24T18:16:38  <McLeopold> for me, it is throwing an error in ants.py, parse_map

2011-05-24T18:17:31  <demerzel> that's my fault
2011-05-24T18:17:35  <demerzel> i was dicking around in there

2011-05-24T18:18:16  <demerzel> i know that now i'm sorry
2011-05-24T18:18:46  <demerzel> i was only on there for a second was curious if it uploaded but nobody was on
2011-05-24T18:18:50  <McLeopold> amstan: can I get a line number on that?

2011-05-24T18:19:27  <amstan> demerzel: should i delete it from db as well? or?
2011-05-24T18:19:31  <demerzel> no i unzipped the zip
2011-05-24T18:19:38  <amstan> sigh..
2011-05-24T18:19:39  <demerzel> i had to sudo so its probably escalated

2011-05-24T18:20:23  <demerzel> itw as just generic mybot.py whatever is standard

2011-05-24T18:20:39  <demerzel> i deleted the zip sorry
2011-05-24T18:20:46  <demerzel> i thought it nly wanted the .py so i put that back
2011-05-24T18:20:49  <demerzel> i didn'tk now it needed the zip
2011-05-24T18:21:02  <amstan> demerzel: submit a new one, maybe that helps
2011-05-24T18:21:07  <demerzel> ok sec
2011-05-24T18:21:14  <McLeopold> amstan: did worker fail gracefully, or did it die?
2011-05-24T18:21:22  <amstan> McLeopold: it looped
2011-05-24T18:21:28  <amstan> ran it with -n 0 though
2011-05-24T18:21:32  <demerzel> amstan: for added confusion, i do have a pending submission
2011-05-24T18:21:33  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-05-24T18:21:52  <amstan> ok, that's it, i'm getting closer and closer to wanting to reinstall all of this
2011-05-24T18:21:57  <McLeopold> that means get task needs to report back to the server an error, but it didn't?
2011-05-24T18:21:57  <demerzel> amstan: nm it says error receiving i will reupload
2011-05-24T18:22:34  <amstan> needsch: lots of this: http://pastebin.com/6kijk47E

2011-05-24T18:22:45  <amstan> needsch: sorry, wp
2011-05-24T18:24:57  <demerzel> thats weird so worker /requires/ there to be a zip present in compiled?
2011-05-24T18:25:06  <demerzel> anyway i reuploaded
2011-05-24T18:25:20  <amstan> same problem, i'm reinstalling
2011-05-24T18:25:33  <amstan> McLeopold: you ok with that?
2011-05-24T18:25:36  <demerzel> wait
2011-05-24T18:25:40  <demerzel> just delete the dir and copy one of yours serious
2011-05-24T18:25:43  <demerzel> dont reinstall over that
2011-05-24T18:25:49  <amstan> demerzel: it'll take like 10 min
2011-05-24T18:25:52  <demerzel> oh
2011-05-24T18:25:55  <amstan> demerzel: and it was already partially broken

2011-05-24T18:26:11  <amstan> McLeopold: you ok with that?
2011-05-24T18:26:28  <demerzel> sorry btw i thought it needed the stuff for command line and the .zip was an artifact from transfer
2011-05-24T18:26:39  <demerzel> not that i plan on doing anything with my new understanding but still

2011-05-24T18:52:05  <Frontier> IE9 defaults to "Quirks mode" on aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com, so it disables the canvas. This is really bad. And also some of the CSS looks wrong in Quirks mode.
2011-05-24T18:52:05  <demerzel> that was useful since i don't have a gcc ubuntu box laying about
2011-05-24T18:52:11  <McLeopold> I don't know what happened last year.  I only wrote perfect code.

2011-05-24T18:58:33  <bhasker> so should i just rename the files to .cpp?

2011-05-24T19:04:03  <ahmedhelal> amstan: not yet, i still have 4 days till our deadline :) , ill try to finish something faster anyway
2011-05-24T19:04:14  <McLeopold> amstan: this is weird, an error about a MyBot.py file in a c bot upload?
2011-05-24T19:04:16  <amstan> ahmedhelal: by 1 week i meant with implementation
2011-05-24T19:04:51  <Frontier> amstan: I know very little about CSS.

2011-05-24T19:04:57  <amstan> Frontier: aww
2011-05-24T19:05:28  <Frontier> and it is not like i see any warnings in ie9 either
2011-05-24T19:05:34  <ahmedhelal> amstan: hmm, ok will try to finish something soon
2011-05-24T19:06:01  <amstan> Frontier: the background is ok, right? the gradient looks the same
2011-05-24T19:06:09  <amstan> Frontier: what about the footer?
2011-05-24T19:07:35  <computerwiz_222> ahmedhelal: are you using IE9 exclusively? have you seen ants in anything else?
2011-05-24T19:07:47  <amstan> computerwiz_222: you mean Frontier
2011-05-24T19:07:53  <computerwiz_222> oh, my bad
2011-05-24T19:08:00  <computerwiz_222> ahmedhelal: ignore that
2011-05-24T19:08:54  <computerwiz_222> amstan: looks like the issues in ie9 are the triangle indentation and the header/footer bg's -- everything else looks mostly okay
2011-05-24T19:08:55  <McLeopold> OH!
2011-05-24T19:09:04  <computerwiz_222> amstan: but how did ie end up blue??
2011-05-24T19:11:42  <Frontier> amstan: the footer is like the header, blue but ok

2011-05-24T19:17:06  <Frontier> amstan: You can fix the gradient, by changing the value of "startColorstr" from #090 to #009900 and do the same expansion for endColorstr
2011-05-24T19:18:31  <Frontier> (in css/layout.css)

2011-05-24T19:25:59  <Frontier> amstan: I don't know how to fix the triangle really. The applied DX filter doesn't seem to affect what's on screen.
2011-05-24T19:27:45  <demerzel> shitty thing about those filters is sometimes they trip security
2011-05-24T19:27:53  <demerzel> depends on the ie version
2011-05-24T19:28:04  <demerzel> as to whether its shown or whether you get a confirmation or nothing at all

2011-05-24T20:28:12  <McLeopold> the stickyness survived a restart of both apache and mysql, so it is probably data related
2011-05-24T20:29:01  <McLeopold> after inserting a row into matchup and matchup_player, it works, so it may only get stuck for specific user/submission id's at this point

2011-05-24T20:33:15  <bhasker> and didn't do shit
2011-05-24T20:33:17  <bhasker> after a point
2011-05-24T20:34:46  <bhasker> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=91
2011-05-24T20:34:47  <bhasker> much better
2011-05-24T20:52:36  <amstan> Frontier: some of the colours are hard to see
2011-05-24T20:52:45  <amstan> purple on brown is not a good idea
2011-05-24T20:54:11  <Frontier> ok, I only noticed that when I started implementing the gfx mode. I'll use one of the other 20 colors in that slot.
2011-05-24T20:56:51  <demerzel> ,bhasker: nice work for a random test prog lol
2011-05-24T20:57:11  <bhasker> not a random test per se:)
2011-05-24T20:58:17  <demerzel> thats as good or better than my 1 day of concerted effort haha
2011-05-24T20:58:49  <demerzel> oh not a random test well thought it was ;)

2011-05-24T22:22:50  <Frontier> amstan: I hope the triangle still displays correctly in firefox, chrome and safari :-)
2011-05-24T22:24:05  <amstan> Frontier: it's ok
2011-05-24T22:24:11  <amstan> Frontier: but what's with the translate(1.24264068711em?
2011-05-24T22:24:24  <Frontier> that is an ugly hack, don't you see that?
2011-05-24T22:24:43  <Frontier> I can explain it if you want?
2011-05-24T22:25:02  <amstan> yes, but why are you changing the one for the other browsers as well?

2011-05-24T22:25:49  <amstan> ideally you should have a thing only for ie that does this
2011-05-24T22:26:11  <amstan> Frontier: hmm, see line 118?
2011-05-24T22:26:14  <Frontier> ok Internet Explorer's matrix transform just enlarges the green box to the right and the bottom. there is no way to rotate it around the center, like in other browsers or move it back in position
2011-05-24T22:26:19  <amstan> Frontier: it says rotation 5
2011-05-24T22:26:24  <amstan> shouldn't it be 45?
2011-05-24T22:26:28  <Frontier> no
2011-05-24T22:26:36  <amstan> the part where you deleted it
2011-05-24T22:26:39  <amstan> 118 deleted
2011-05-24T22:26:50  <amstan> filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=***5***); /*for IE*/
2011-05-24T22:27:05  <Frontier> so what I did is move the box to a position where it will be correct after IE's awkward rotation filter.
2011-05-24T22:28:17  <Frontier> in the other browsers I just mimic that behaviour by rotating and then moving the box by sin(45°) * 3em - something i forgot
2011-05-24T22:28:28  <amstan> ok, cool
2011-05-24T22:28:37  <amstan> does it show all good now in ie?
2011-05-24T22:29:41  <Frontier> yes, though it rotates a bitmap of the box there and you see 1. a black line on the border from top to right and 2. no antialiasing
2011-05-24T22:29:59  <Frontier> but it is really hardly visible, so thumbs up
2011-05-24T22:30:48  <amstan> :( http://browsershots.org/screenshots/8ffa8336267795ac7784e290ca1c3fb0
2011-05-24T22:30:57  <Frontier> BasicImage rotation just didn't work at all. maybe it can only rotate by 90° increments or works on pictures only... no idea
2011-05-24T22:31:00  <amstan> what's the point of having browsershots if it scrolls to the middle of the page?
2011-05-24T22:31:55  <amstan> http://browsershots.org/screenshots/c595e7f456a216280486b2455a51c259
2011-05-24T22:31:57  <amstan> oh man..
2011-05-24T22:31:58  <Frontier> THAT version of Opera is ancient, it doesn't implement the JSON parser yet. Also for security reasons this person should update asap :p
2011-05-24T22:32:01  <amstan> msie6!
2011-05-24T22:32:12  <amstan> it works good too
2011-05-24T22:32:13  <amstan> lol
2011-05-24T22:32:19  <amstan> wait, nvm, that's 8
2011-05-24T22:32:35  <amstan> this is 7: http://browsershots.org/screenshots/7309caf558e2da73b86d8cba21da859e
2011-05-24T22:34:13  <Frontier> I cannot install IE 7 to fix that. And where is the person who created the css anyway?
2011-05-24T22:34:57  <Frontier> Then again, look at how many ppl still use IE 7. <1% I assume. And they have other options.
2011-05-24T22:37:07  <amstan> Frontier: that would be me, lol
2011-05-24T22:37:40  <amstan> usually i throw something like http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/ at it
2011-05-24T22:37:42  <amstan> it does wonders
2011-05-24T22:37:57  <Frontier> haha, then go install WinXP in a VM and test yourself. I know it is tideous :p
2011-05-24T22:38:00  <amstan> makes ie6 behave like a proper browser
2011-05-24T22:38:09  <amstan> same for ie7 and 8
2011-05-24T22:38:59  <amstan> i used it on http://www.sandhillconsultants.com/
2011-05-24T22:39:02  <amstan> but don't tell anyone
2011-05-24T22:41:48  <Frontier> You could give it a try if it is able to fix some of the css formating. Though I don't know how good it is at the matrix computation I did there. It will have its limitations.

2011-05-24T22:43:22  <amstan> i doubt it could do that rotate thing
2011-05-24T22:43:28  <Frontier> w3c shows ~7.5% for IE6+IE7. That is different on ai-contest.com, but still they die hard. Probably some older school PCs.
2011-05-24T22:43:31  <amstan> that's more like a css3 thing,
2011-05-24T22:44:40  <amstan> apparently someone uses IE 999.1
2011-05-24T22:44:44  <amstan> must be advanced shit!
2011-05-24T22:45:10  <Frontier> lololol
2011-05-24T22:45:26  <amstan> so.. IE is 6.53% of visitors
2011-05-24T22:45:47  <amstan> and IE7 is 13.22% of that, IE6 is 4.69%
2011-05-24T22:45:59  <Frontier> hmm actually I have IE6 installed on wine... but no, I wont bother. Next thing I fix is the php, then the engine. no, I stick with my visualizer
2011-05-24T22:46:27  <amstan> well.. i should check some of the issues
2011-05-24T22:46:36  <amstan> i think we fixed a few
2011-05-24T22:46:50  <Frontier> 1,17% then :)
2011-05-24T22:47:33  <Frontier> must be the relatives of the programmers
2011-05-24T22:49:03  <amstan> ie9.js should fix them
2011-05-24T22:49:39  <amstan> Frontier: here's one if you want: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/120
2011-05-24T22:50:32  <amstan> contestbot: seen janzert
2011-05-24T22:50:32  <contestbot> amstan: janzert was last seen in #aichallenge 3 days, 14 hours, 40 minutes, and 59 seconds ago: <janzert> contestbot: later tell amstan also I'm working out of town until Thursday so so probably won't be coding anything until after that
2011-05-24T22:50:44  <amstan> that explains it then
2011-05-24T22:50:55  <amstan> contestbot; y u no tell me?
2011-05-24T22:50:56  <contestbot> amstan: You have no gotten any error messages recently, so here's a random one just to let you know that we care.

2011-05-24T22:57:35  <Frontier> it should have a web interface so you can put text in irc on behalf of 'contestbot'. That would make for some nice "wft"s
