2011-05-23T00:50:34  <demerzel> flagrunner uploaded a c bot
2011-05-23T00:50:40  <demerzel> i thought it would take worker to compile it
2011-05-23T00:50:49  <amstan> yeah.. the compiling worked for a while
2011-05-23T00:50:51  <demerzel> *flagcapper
2011-05-23T00:50:56  <amstan> i think the db is broken or something

2011-05-23T00:56:53  <demerzel> when i uploaded something it took it but when i went to go look it's the .py
2011-05-23T00:56:59  <demerzel> i dont think uploads are working
2011-05-23T00:57:23  <demerzel> unless they're stored somewhere other than /uploads/0/6
2011-05-23T00:57:39  <demerzel> is there a holder spot for uploads prior to going there amstan?
2011-05-23T00:57:51  <amstan>  /tmp i think
2011-05-23T00:57:56  <amstan> see submit.php
2011-05-23T00:57:58  <demerzel> if they are supposed to go straight to 0/user then it's not working, i uploaded

2011-05-23T17:07:56  <McLeopold> amstan: hello, tel me about the new server
2011-05-23T17:08:02  <amstan> McLeopold: yay
2011-05-23T17:08:22  <amstan> McLeopold: ssh mcleopold@aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com
2011-05-23T17:09:26  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-23T17:09:44  <Hjax> hello
2011-05-23T17:09:45  <amstan> McLeopold: it was donated by demerzel
2011-05-23T17:09:54  <amstan> McLeopold: and it's good for 24/7
2011-05-23T17:10:07  <amstan> problem is that the code for the contest is broken, so it went all crazy
2011-05-23T17:11:06  <amstan> McLeopold: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/119
2011-05-23T17:11:11  <McLeopold> crazy how?
2011-05-23T17:11:24  <amstan> see latest comment
2011-05-23T17:11:55  <McLeopold> Man, I'm a really bad programmer...
2011-05-23T17:12:03  <amstan> i noticed, lol
2011-05-23T17:12:13  <amstan> also.. login so you can change your pass
2011-05-23T17:12:38  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-23T17:14:09  <amstan> barracuda.images?
2011-05-23T17:14:30  <amstan> oh.. ok

2011-05-23T17:22:21  <McLeopold> amstan: why didn't you guys just rollback my horrible code?
2011-05-23T17:22:53  <amstan> your code does 2 things: it fixes the no food games
2011-05-23T17:23:00  <amstan> but it crashes compiling
2011-05-23T17:23:21  <amstan> i tried playing around
2011-05-23T17:23:30  <amstan> but i eventually got to the annoying part where it looped
2011-05-23T17:23:37  <amstan> and then i couldn't do anything, with any version
2011-05-23T17:23:41  <McLeopold> I was trying to copy a python dict, and used slice notation...
2011-05-23T17:23:46  <McLeopold> which is wrong
2011-05-23T17:23:47  <amstan> yes, i noticed
2011-05-23T17:27:33  <McLeopold> amstan: so, how did it resolve the no food games then?
2011-05-23T17:27:43  <McLeopold> I would expect it to crash both...
2011-05-23T17:27:55  <amstan> it worked on the other server
2011-05-23T17:28:00  <amstan> since nobody was submitting new bots
2011-05-23T17:28:02  <amstan> idk how
2011-05-23T17:28:06  <amstan> i just git pulled and it worked
2011-05-23T17:28:11  <McLeopold> weird
