2010-10-02T02:27:49  <Sylph> my bot only attack atm, need to get it to defend then it'd be perfect
2010-10-02T02:28:14  <Sylph> still trying to figure out the best method that take into acccount every possibility :|
2010-10-02T02:29:11  <HakanD> and I broke the 30 wpm barrier (:

2010-10-02T02:40:07  <Sylph> nah
2010-10-02T02:40:29  <Sylph> a few simpler methods would work with no problem on attack strategy

2010-10-02T02:41:14  <Sylph> Problem is thinking of the perfect one
2010-10-02T02:41:19  <Sylph> like imagine you got 20 ships at planet 1
2010-10-02T02:41:26  <HakanD> there is a balance between perfect attack and perfect defense, can't have both (:
2010-10-02T02:41:38  <Sylph> growth rate is 5 per turn, making it 70 ships in 10 turns.
2010-10-02T02:41:54  <Sylph> enemy coming in with 70 ships
2010-10-02T02:42:04  <Sylph> most defense codes probably would just sit and do nothing
2010-10-02T02:42:14  <HakanD> yea
2010-10-02T02:42:17  <Sylph> I want to be able to move the ships around nearby planets to defend othe planets if needed
2010-10-02T02:42:27  <Sylph> before it have to be located in that planet.
2010-10-02T02:42:39  <Sylph> A lil complex to think about, hrm
2010-10-02T02:43:26  <Sylph> nm, that might be easy with my future projection as it is
2010-10-02T02:43:41  <Sylph> there's the next step too, possible ships that enemy  will send in to reinforce
2010-10-02T02:44:09  <Sylph> and yeah on the balance, I was talking about perfect attack within the constrain of perfect defense :p
2010-10-02T02:49:14  <Sylph> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=267909  -> you'll notice that I always take the planets I attack
2010-10-02T02:49:20  <Sylph> no matter what
2010-10-02T02:49:29  <Sylph> just need to add defense algorithm atm, still trying to think of the best one

2010-10-02T08:52:04  <Migi32> sigh, well, I mean that as it's given more computing time, it would play better and better, and the limit of how good it plays would surpass any currently existing bot
2010-10-02T08:52:26  <Migi32> like minimax
2010-10-02T08:53:10  <sigh> it's not immediately obvious that a minimax bot would satisfy that criteria, athough it is most likely true
2010-10-02T08:53:30  <sigh> an minimax bot would be making pessimal assumptions
2010-10-02T08:53:36  <Migi32> such as?
2010-10-02T08:53:52  <sigh> your opponent knows what moves you make
2010-10-02T08:54:18  <Migi32> ah yes, true
2010-10-02T08:55:20  <sigh> I wasn't in the tron contest, but minimax worked well enough there... so it's not completely bad :P
2010-10-02T08:56:20  <sigh> in a game with this much flexibility, making assumptions like that might paralyse your bot
2010-10-02T08:56:57  <sigh> so back to what I said, it's not immediately obvious :)
2010-10-02T08:56:57  <Migi32> good point

2010-10-02T08:59:56  <Migi32> a1k0n one said "turns out, knowing the move your opponent made before you make yours gives you a huuuuuge advantage"
2010-10-02T09:01:12  <sigh> yup
2010-10-02T09:01:22  <Migi32> then he said his alpha-beta search didn't work out "basically for the 'minimax incorrect' reasons from the tron contest"
2010-10-02T09:01:51  <Migi32> so did minimax work out for Tron or didn't it?
2010-10-02T09:02:18  <antimatroid2> speak of the devil
2010-10-02T09:02:28  <antimatroid2> i am in the process of trying to set up a minimax bot and see how it goes
2010-10-02T09:02:43  <antimatroid2> Migi32: minimax was very much the winning strategy for tron in the end
2010-10-02T09:02:47  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=272178
2010-10-02T09:02:48  <bhasker> :D
2010-10-02T09:02:53  <antimatroid2> although a1k0n is convinced one could have beaten it
2010-10-02T09:03:18  <antimatroid2> yeah, not sure what my front line planet thinks he's doing sending ships off like that :P
2010-10-02T09:03:36  <sigh> Migi32: this is a1k0n's write up of the tron contest: http://a1k0n.net/blah/archives/2010/03/index.html#e2010-03-04T14_00_21.txt
2010-10-02T09:03:48  <bhasker> heh my front planet does that to
2010-10-02T09:03:48  <sigh> it seems that a lot of people were using minimax
2010-10-02T09:04:11  <bhasker> the problem with minimax i feel is your prediction of whats best for the enemy is not well defined
2010-10-02T09:04:16  <sigh> He does say this though: "I had long ago come to the realization that a better evaluation heuristic will always beat deeper minimax searches, because a deep minimax search using a flawed evaluation heuristic is self-deluded about what its opponent is actually going to do, and will occasionally favor moves that lose to moves that win, simply because it can't tell the difference. Anything you can do to make your ev
2010-10-02T09:04:19  <sigh> aluation function smarter will result in improved play in the long run."
2010-10-02T09:04:34  <sigh> so based on that, his final bot didn't use minimax?
2010-10-02T09:04:41  <antimatroid2> we used minimax, starting with us moving first, and them picking optimally agains tus
2010-10-02T09:04:41  <bhasker> exactly pretty much what i feel about minimax
2010-10-02T09:04:43  <sigh> dunno, I'll have to ask him when he is around :P
2010-10-02T09:04:53  <sigh> a1k0n: you here?
2010-10-02T09:04:54  <bhasker> yes but how do you know in this case that your pick is optimal
2010-10-02T09:04:54  <Migi32> no I'd say it did use minimax but with a better heuristic
2010-10-02T09:05:06  <bhasker> what if you picked a suboptimal move for your oppoonent
2010-10-02T09:05:13  <bhasker> your whole evaluation falls apart
2010-10-02T09:05:14  <antimatroid2> sigh: it did, he just thinks one could have exploited the fact that a bot was using minimax
2010-10-02T09:05:34  <sigh> ah, ok...
2010-10-02T09:05:37  <antimatroid2> at least that's my understanding of what he thinks, i can't fully speak for him :P

2010-10-02T09:06:49  <Migi32> but antimatroid2 how are you implementing this minimax? Isn't the "branching factor" waaay too high?
2010-10-02T09:06:51  <bhasker> yea but in this thats not really possible
2010-10-02T09:06:59  <bhasker> too many possible moves
2010-10-02T09:07:06  <antimatroid2> yes, i have to "select" a small subset of the possible strategy space
2010-10-02T09:07:16  <antimatroid2> that's why i'm just trying it out to see how it goes
2010-10-02T09:07:19  <bhasker> exactly so that selection strategy may not be correct ^
2010-10-02T09:07:25  <antimatroid2> ^^
2010-10-02T09:07:26  <bhasker> if that is not correct, it falls apart
2010-10-02T09:07:40  <bhasker> though i should check http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=272651
2010-10-02T09:07:48  <bhasker> why my bot decided that going for that far off planet was a bright idea
2010-10-02T09:07:57  <bhasker> probably because of its 8 size
2010-10-02T09:08:01  <bhasker> 8 ships ^
2010-10-02T09:08:27  <antimatroid2> i have a few ideas to get the tree generation going in the right direction
2010-10-02T09:08:33  <antimatroid2> so i will just see how it goes
2010-10-02T09:08:44  <Migi32> well you can select your own strategies but you simply can't select your opponent's moves unless you know for sure all non-selected moves are worse than your selected moves
2010-10-02T09:08:53  <antimatroid2> i'm still not sure what the optimal moves per turn/depth of tree ratio will be
2010-10-02T09:09:29  <sigh> bhasker: you seem to have a off-by-one error, your bot send 20 ships to a 20-ship neutral

2010-10-02T09:09:42  <antimatroid2> the idea is to pick moves i might make, then have them make their moves based off them "already knowing what I did" and then eliminating moves they will easily exploit

2010-10-02T09:09:47  <bhasker> i think

2010-10-02T09:10:00  <antimatroid2> and then repeat as long as i can
2010-10-02T09:10:14  <antimatroid2> it's awefully messy, still not entirely sure how it'll come together

2010-10-02T09:10:22  <sigh> not well coordinated
2010-10-02T09:10:36  <antimatroid2> sigh: i do that as well, i tried making them coordinate arrival, but it just makes the bot send more
2010-10-02T09:10:41  <bhasker> yea i don't coordinate attacks
2010-10-02T09:10:41  <Migi32> well antimatroid2 say you want to look 20 moves ahead, more than 2 optimal moves / turn is probably not going to work
2010-10-02T09:10:45  <sigh> send more?
2010-10-02T09:10:52  <antimatroid2> 20 moves ahead isn't going to happen
2010-10-02T09:11:01  <bhasker> i basically sort the list of ships available by proximity to planet
2010-10-02T09:11:04  <sigh> haha 20 moves
2010-10-02T09:11:07  <bhasker> and send from closest planets
2010-10-02T09:11:12  <bhasker> when i try to pile up ships
2010-10-02T09:11:13  <Migi32> aren't some maps like 20 turns in diameter?
2010-10-02T09:11:15  <antimatroid2> you'll be lucky to get 5
2010-10-02T09:11:17  <bhasker> it actually does worse
2010-10-02T09:11:33  <bhasker> sending partial fleets actually works better imo

2010-10-02T09:11:58  <antimatroid2> even tic tac toe game trees are quite large
2010-10-02T09:12:08  <sigh> the other bots at the top seem to do it as well
2010-10-02T09:12:10  <bhasker> the problem with coordinating
2010-10-02T09:12:19  <bhasker> i know adum's doesn't coordinate
2010-10-02T09:12:26  <antimatroid2> there's over 2 million unique subgame perfect nash equilbibria in the trivial 2 player 2x2 tic tac toe game
2010-10-02T09:12:28  <sigh> yeah not all
2010-10-02T09:12:38  <antimatroid2> might be 1 million, i could work it out if you insist :P
2010-10-02T09:12:51  <bhasker> as i was saying problem i found with coordinating is you lose time
2010-10-02T09:13:01  <bhasker> and that is a cost that needs to be applied
2010-10-02T09:13:07  <sigh> how do you lose time?
2010-10-02T09:13:15  <Migi32> antimatroid2, seriously? wow
2010-10-02T09:13:25  <bhasker> well a) you have to funnel ships to a planet from where you can launch the attack
2010-10-02T09:13:45  <bhasker> so all your ships have to travel to the tip of your attack
2010-10-02T09:13:52  <bhasker> vs going straight for the attack

2010-10-02T09:14:05  <sigh> bhasker: no, what I mean is that you send ships so they arrive at the same time
2010-10-02T09:14:18  <sigh> the way you describe is slower, yes
2010-10-02T09:14:40  <bhasker> so you launch from further out planets before you launch from nearer ones

2010-10-02T09:14:45  <sigh> yup
2010-10-02T09:14:52  <bhasker> i tried doing that but i can't seem to get the math right ^
2010-10-02T09:14:56  <sigh> ah ok
2010-10-02T09:14:58  <bhasker> and my bot might switch priorities midway
2010-10-02T09:15:18  <sigh> :)
2010-10-02T09:15:23  <bhasker> so either i have to add some attack logic that remembers that it started attacking something and remembers to complete it
2010-10-02T09:15:32  <bhasker> basically if i leave ships where they are
2010-10-02T09:15:38  <bhasker> they get redirected

2010-10-02T09:16:05  <Migi32> bhasker, if you start an attack it's a "sunk cost", so it might not always be the optimal move to complete the attack fully

2010-10-02T09:16:28  * sigh was pointing at Migi32
2010-10-02T09:16:28  <bhasker> should try coordinating it
2010-10-02T09:16:40  <bhasker> my math is not working out for that ^
2010-10-02T09:17:07  <antimatroid2> yeah, it's 1327104 pure strategy subgame perfect nash equilbria
2010-10-02T09:17:11  <antimatroid2> ridiculous
2010-10-02T09:17:15  <sigh> it's also a good test of your prediction code, very obvious if things are off :D
2010-10-02T09:17:59  <antimatroid2> i agree with the notion of it being a sunk cost, but whenever i tell it to wait for other ones it does worse
2010-10-02T09:18:25  <antimatroid2> i do have it redirecting fleets to planets closer to enemies such that the journey would finish in the same time as the furtherst "source" planet though

2010-10-02T09:19:25  <dmj111> bhasker: on a given turn, if I attack from multiple planets, I "launch" from them all.   Only the ones furthest out really launch, but internally, my code creates a fleet for every planet involved, so I don't overload any planet with future launches.

2010-10-02T09:19:28  <antimatroid2> i shall see if that's why it does worse later
2010-10-02T09:19:28  <bhasker> oh well let me see if i can try getting the coordination logic correct
2010-10-02T09:19:46  <dmj111> like sigh, my code does not track state between turns, so each turn it can change plans.

2010-10-02T09:20:08  <bhasker> makes sense
2010-10-02T09:20:10  <antimatroid2> i just subtract those ship amounts without adding a fleet :P
2010-10-02T09:20:19  <antimatroid2> and store fleets between turns
2010-10-02T09:20:20  <bhasker> i should try that out
2010-10-02T09:20:33  <dmj111> sigh: i agree, the benefit is not clear cut.   I prefer launching later, in case the enemy does not decide to reinforce, I don't commit forces.  But, it might keep my bot from doing some of the dumb things it does.
2010-10-02T09:21:08  <bhasker> do any of you do fleet merging
2010-10-02T09:21:24  <sigh> dmj111: yeah, I've just found that waiting improves my performance... I haven't tried mixed strategies yet
2010-10-02T09:21:24  <dmj111> antimatroid2: I create a fleet, because I recalculate the future state of the game based on the fleets to decide the next target to attack on the turn.  This was a hack to keep me from re-attacking a planet again on the same turn.
2010-10-02T09:21:24  <bhasker> one thing i was thinking was if i have two neutrals to capture same turn
2010-10-02T09:21:28  <sigh> merging?
2010-10-02T09:21:29  <bhasker> and in the same direction
2010-10-02T09:21:33  <bhasker> merge the fleets to one neutral
2010-10-02T09:21:58  <bhasker> not sure if that works out better
2010-10-02T09:22:03  <sigh> I'm not sure what you mean, how is that different from what we were talking about?
2010-10-02T09:22:16  <bhasker> what i mean is this
2010-10-02T09:22:20  <bhasker> lets say you launch from A
2010-10-02T09:22:21  <dmj111> bhasker: maybe, but the shortest path between two points cannot include a pit stop.  It will take longer, but maybe it will add a surprise factor.
2010-10-02T09:22:33  <bhasker> well its harder to counter dmj
2010-10-02T09:22:40  <bhasker> since i send 2x the ships to one planet
2010-10-02T09:22:41  <Migi32> antimatroid2, I don't know much about Nash equilibria, but if there's only 24 ways that this 2x2 tic tac toe can play out, how can you have more equilibria?
2010-10-02T09:22:48  <bhasker> so enemy can't counter
2010-10-02T09:22:48  <dmj111> good point
2010-10-02T09:23:17  <bhasker> basically if you have two planets that are within say a few degrees of each other in the same direction
2010-10-02T09:23:17  <antimatroid2> Migi32: a strategy is defined as the move each player might make at every possible node in the tree they might reach
2010-10-02T09:23:27  <bhasker> merge the fleets headed to the two of them and send them to just one of them
2010-10-02T09:23:27  <sigh> bhasker: ah, I understand
2010-10-02T09:23:35  <dmj111> i guess i was thinking of two neutrals you could clearly take, not ones where there is possible contention from the enemy... because my bot is a chicken and never tries that anyway :)
2010-10-02T09:23:38  <bhasker> though it would probably work only early game
2010-10-02T09:24:00  <bhasker> late game you rarely take two neutrals at same time
2010-10-02T09:24:07  <bhasker> so not sure how much benefit there is in that
2010-10-02T09:24:26  <bhasker> your bot is funny to watch its like a predator
2010-10-02T09:24:35  <bhasker> it waits then jumps at you in one shot
2010-10-02T09:24:38  <bhasker> and wipes you out
2010-10-02T09:24:48  <sigh> :)
2010-10-02T09:24:51  <antimatroid2> you wouldn't ever calculate all of those for an ai bot, i just wrote such a function for a library i'm putting together, so was testing it out
2010-10-02T09:25:01  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=272838
2010-10-02T09:25:05  <antimatroid2> no surprises the function didn't work on 3x3 tic tac toe
2010-10-02T09:25:08  <bhasker> i don't understand why your bot sent 93 ships
2010-10-02T09:25:11  <bhasker> to a 1 growth planet?
2010-10-02T09:25:17  <antimatroid2> i couldn't even find a nash equilibria for 4x4
2010-10-02T09:25:27  <bhasker> when the planet has 8 ships on it?
2010-10-02T09:25:29  <antimatroid2> or 3x3x3
2010-10-02T09:25:38  <dmj111> bhasker: dmj111 == chicken hawk
2010-10-02T09:25:58  <sigh> bhasker: I assume because it's closer to the enemy
2010-10-02T09:26:12  <bhasker> i think dmj restricts the space to search initially
2010-10-02T09:26:13  <sigh> and dmj111 decided it needs some extra protection :)
2010-10-02T09:26:14  <bhasker> it didnt find any planets
2010-10-02T09:26:23  <bhasker> so it sent everthing up front
2010-10-02T09:26:32  <antimatroid2> dmj111 waits patiently till he can just waltz over and fuck you up
2010-10-02T09:26:49  <antimatroid2> i still haven't been able to properly counter it whilst not getting ruined by other more agressive bots
2010-10-02T09:26:52  <bhasker> these vortex.* variants are annoying
2010-10-02T09:27:07  <antimatroid2> i get him most of the time atm :D
2010-10-02T09:27:16  <dmj111> antimatroid2: thanks...  I feel proud of that statement... but a little weird for it.
2010-10-02T09:27:24  <sigh> haha
2010-10-02T09:27:51  <antimatroid2> most of your wins are under 100 moves, and it's usually a result of the other player expanding too fast and allowing your bot to just go in for the kill :P
2010-10-02T09:27:51  <dmj111> sigh: I think you are right.  I have a couple of different priorities in the code, and the interact strangely at times.  Your explanation makes the most sense.
2010-10-02T09:28:10  <dmj111> oops ... might have been bhasker, not sigh.
2010-10-02T09:28:31  <dmj111> bahhh.... it was sigh.  I am not allowed to type any more.
2010-10-02T09:28:36  <sigh> dmj111: I have a bot that behaves similarly :)
2010-10-02T09:28:52  <sigh> in that respect, not overall
2010-10-02T09:29:02  <sigh> (otherwise I would upload it :P)
2010-10-02T09:29:18  <dmj111> :)  That behaviour has given me some losses too, though.
2010-10-02T09:29:27  <antimatroid2> my current bot better make top 10 on official site aha
2010-10-02T09:29:42  <antimatroid2> it hasn't lost on there yet, but still above 200
2010-10-02T09:29:44  <bhasker> dmj http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=266834
2010-10-02T09:29:54  <bhasker> my bot counters your surprise ^
2010-10-02T09:30:02  <bhasker> sometimes ^
2010-10-02T09:30:17  <dmj111> nice :)
2010-10-02T09:30:39  <bhasker> wow the top 3 bots are at 3800 elo now ^
2010-10-02T09:31:26  <bhasker> the goal to hit top 10-20 seems further and further away /cry
2010-10-02T09:31:33  <sigh> bottom bots are down to 378, almost 3500 point range
2010-10-02T09:32:10  <antimatroid2> bhasker: the bots keep getting better and better every day, it's very annoying
2010-10-02T09:32:22  <sigh> yup, I've been kicked out of the top 10
2010-10-02T09:32:31  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-02T09:32:34  <bhasker> i see new names up there
2010-10-02T09:32:36  <Migi32> aren't you able to set standard deviation in the ELO algorithm?
2010-10-02T09:32:49  <Migi32> isn't it a parameter?
2010-10-02T09:32:53  <antimatroid2> woah, new leader
2010-10-02T09:32:58  <sigh> @rankings
2010-10-02T09:33:00  <contestbot> sigh: Top 10 players: ruilov(3821), Hazard(3808), rsergio(3755), EBraun(3680), cfaftw(3663), felixcoto(3653), dmj111(3638), sequoh(3620), _iouri_(3609), davidjliu(3569)
2010-10-02T09:33:07  <sigh> haha, yeah
2010-10-02T09:33:09  <bhasker> look at the difference
2010-10-02T09:33:15  <antimatroid2> he just beat hazard
2010-10-02T09:33:27  <bhasker> the 4th bot is almost 200 elo points lower
2010-10-02T09:33:49  *** keynes <keynes!~AndChat@211.234.145.8> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-02T09:34:17  <antimatroid2> ruilov hasn't played very many games
2010-10-02T09:34:36  <Migi32> yea I noticed that too
2010-10-02T09:34:38  <dmj111> the true skill idea is probably a good one.
2010-10-02T09:34:40  <Migi32> he submitted today
2010-10-02T09:34:46  <bhasker> oh he beat hazard
2010-10-02T09:34:47  <bhasker> thats why
2010-10-02T09:34:54  <antimatroid2> he beat quite a few top bots
2010-10-02T09:34:57  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-02T09:35:00  <antimatroid2> but how'd it get paired against them so fast?
2010-10-02T09:35:11  <bhasker> luck?
2010-10-02T09:35:21  <bhasker> since top bots get paired against lower bots
2010-10-02T09:35:23  <bhasker> every now and then
2010-10-02T09:35:35  <bhasker> like my bot plays people at 150-200 rank
2010-10-02T09:35:40  <bhasker> even though its at 78
2010-10-02T09:35:47  <Migi32> I think in ELO, your first 10-ish games make your ELO go up/down faster than later games
2010-10-02T09:35:48  <antimatroid2> my bots won 8/8 games and it's ranked 230
2010-10-02T09:35:52  <Migi32> and he won all first 10
2010-10-02T09:36:01  <Migi32> oh no wait he didn't
2010-10-02T09:36:29  <antimatroid2> although i have absolutely spammed submissions last few days, oops
2010-10-02T09:36:36  <bhasker> lol http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=273000
2010-10-02T09:36:55  <bhasker> you take the 1 growth in middle and pile up ships there
2010-10-02T09:37:14  <sigh> hmmm... in his game against me he won by controlling the center :( http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5222313
2010-10-02T09:37:25  <sigh> it was close for a while
2010-10-02T09:37:45  <bhasker> antimatroid that was for you sorry
2010-10-02T09:38:29  *** Itkovian <Itkovian!~Itkovian@2002:4e16:e2a0:0:21f:5bff:fec8:6e2c> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-02T09:38:42  <antimatroid2> yep, hence why i decided to move on and try minimax
2010-10-02T09:38:52  <antimatroid2> my bot still loses, it's not acceptable :(
2010-10-02T09:39:38  <bhasker> i remember why i didnt coordinate attacks
2010-10-02T09:39:43  <bhasker> i launch from the closest planet first
2010-10-02T09:40:26  <antimatroid2> the other thing about sending parts later is you keep that as private information
2010-10-02T09:40:29  <bhasker> maybe i need to queue up the orders, then only execute a few ones
2010-10-02T09:40:45  <antimatroid2> if that hasn't been mentioned
2010-10-02T09:41:18  <bhasker> let me quickly implement it and see
2010-10-02T09:41:21  <antimatroid2> same with redirection part of the way when possible
2010-10-02T09:41:40  <sigh> antimatroid2: yah, that is a big part of it
2010-10-02T09:41:44  <antimatroid2> so you reveal that information at the latest time possible while still executing the intended move
2010-10-02T09:41:57  <sigh> if your enemy moves some units to protect, you can switch targets
2010-10-02T09:42:10  <sigh> where as if you are commited, then you can't do anything
2010-10-02T09:42:17  <antimatroid2> sigh: your enemy wont even necesseraly know what you're intending :P
2010-10-02T09:42:38  <antimatroid2> they'd do a damn good job to know somehow
2010-10-02T09:43:35  <sigh> yeah, but you can make assumptions based on the fact that you are already under attack :)
2010-10-02T09:43:54  *** Itkovian <Itkovian!~Itkovian@2002:4e16:e2a0:0:21f:5bff:fec8:6e2c> has quit IRC (Quit: Itkovian)
2010-10-02T09:44:17  <antimatroid2> yeah, but they wont necessarily know you're about to take a neutral near teh centre till you make your last move closer to the centre
2010-10-02T09:44:44  <antimatroid2> is anyone currently picking to move to those planets cause the other player sent some ships there from a planet further away? i doubt it
2010-10-02T09:44:57  <sigh> heh
2010-10-02T09:46:11  <antimatroid2> DRAW is so annoying, but it'd be worse if it was LOSS aha
2010-10-02T09:47:20  <antimatroid2> i wonder if it'd be possible to write a bot that when winning could then try to cause a draw at the end
2010-10-02T09:47:26  <antimatroid2> that's be cool
2010-10-02T09:47:30  <antimatroid2> that'd*
2010-10-02T09:48:11  <antimatroid2> wouldn't be hard to write, how well it'd go though i dunno
2010-10-02T09:48:41  <sigh> draws are hard to manufacture
2010-10-02T09:48:59  <antimatroid2> you'd have it make moves based off the end turn
2010-10-02T09:49:11  <antimatroid2> and hope the other player doesn't mess up the intention for right at the end
2010-10-02T09:49:11  <sigh> it becomes easier if there are neutral planets to suicide into
2010-10-02T09:49:16  <antimatroid2> would need to be in front though i think
2010-10-02T09:49:22  <antimatroid2> yeah
2010-10-02T09:50:04  <sigh> I would be very impressed if you made a bot that could create draws
2010-10-02T09:51:51  <antimatroid2> bhasker: well i don't always lose to you :)
2010-10-02T09:52:01  <bhasker> i know:p
2010-10-02T09:52:09  <bhasker> thats why i feel happy when i beat one of the top bots
2010-10-02T09:52:12  <bhasker> mostly i get crushed ^
2010-10-02T09:52:22  <antimatroid2> i don't think i'd say i have one of the top bots
2010-10-02T09:52:41  <bhasker> well on tcp at least:)
2010-10-02T09:52:59  <antimatroid2> yeah, hardly anyone's running their bots on there atm though
2010-10-02T09:53:55  <bhasker> there is dmj /you /vortex.*/golfin /voidptr/locutus and bartwe
2010-10-02T09:54:02  <bhasker> i would say thats a decent competition
2010-10-02T09:54:09  <bhasker> and then there is DRAW
2010-10-02T09:54:18  <bhasker> and all the whiteside variants
2010-10-02T09:54:23  <sigh> hmmm... I'll put up one of my bots, I don't know how it will do
2010-10-02T09:54:29  <sigh> it's too aggressive
2010-10-02T09:54:53  <antimatroid2> i can't find the right balance between agressive and patient
2010-10-02T09:55:09  <antimatroid2> it's there somewhere
2010-10-02T09:55:20  <sigh> it depends on what the opponent is doing
2010-10-02T09:55:33  <antimatroid2> yeah, but it gets very complicated
2010-10-02T09:55:37  <sigh> currently my bot ignores the opponent for the most part
2010-10-02T09:55:42  <antimatroid2> bugs pop up everywhere
2010-10-02T09:56:13  <antimatroid2> i am not paying attention to the moves they make, but that's going to change
2010-10-02T09:56:27  <antimatroid2> dev_tcp is playing again now too
2010-10-02T09:56:31  <antimatroid2> and i beat the moungrel
2010-10-02T09:56:36  <antimatroid2> he was owning me before
2010-10-02T09:57:53  <antimatroid2> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=272869
2010-10-02T09:57:54  <antimatroid2> wiw

2010-10-02T09:58:01  <FlagCapper> Wow I'm on a lucky streak
2010-10-02T09:58:08  <bhasker> hah nice 7 turns
2010-10-02T09:58:19  <sigh> antimatroid2: ah 7 moves, like I did to bartwe :D
2010-10-02T09:58:21  <FlagCapper> Nice
2010-10-02T09:58:45  <contestbot> Top 10 players: ruilov(3823), Hazard(3807), rsergio(3732), EBraun(3690), felixcoto(3660), cfaftw(3658), dmj111(3634), sequoh(3619), _iouri_(3608), sighbot(3567)

2010-10-02T09:59:21  <sigh> :P
2010-10-02T09:59:38  <antimatroid2> i've almost breached top 100
2010-10-02T09:59:48  <sigh> hurry up :)
2010-10-02T10:00:08  <antimatroid2> it's probably lose soon and take even longer
2010-10-02T10:00:30  <antimatroid2> wow, my english is all over the show tonight
2010-10-02T10:01:29  <bhasker> your bot should be in the top 40-50 my bot is 76
2010-10-02T10:01:36  <bhasker> and been holding there for last couple of days now
2010-10-02T10:01:42  <bhasker> and your bot does much better than mine

2010-10-02T10:09:36  <sigh> lol, that was a boring game :P
2010-10-02T10:09:42  <antimatroid2> it was
2010-10-02T10:10:10  <antimatroid2> lol, i went down in ranking on the main site from a win
2010-10-02T10:10:56  <Migi32> is that even possible?
2010-10-02T10:11:04  <antimatroid2> yes, play a lower ranked person
2010-10-02T10:11:10  <antimatroid2> or other people you played drop in ranking
2010-10-02T10:11:17  <sigh> you can do up from a loss too
2010-10-02T10:11:23  <sigh> *go
2010-10-02T10:11:24  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-02T10:11:39  <antimatroid2> draw on a stupid map is most painful
2010-10-02T10:11:44  <sigh> you lost to dmj111! you must be really strong!
2010-10-02T10:11:52  <Mathnerd314> I thought that was going to get fixed using lower-bound instead of upper-bound...
2010-10-02T10:12:11  <antimatroid2> i have beaten him at least twice today
2010-10-02T10:12:22  <Mathnerd314> s/upper-bound/most likely score/
2010-10-02T10:12:26  <antimatroid2> well, yesterday*
2010-10-02T10:12:26  <Migi32> oh you mean you went down in ranking, not in ELO
2010-10-02T10:12:42  <antimatroid2> i don't track the elo score sorry
2010-10-02T10:13:23  <antimatroid2> wow, 3 loses in a row

2010-10-02T10:14:17  <medeman> hi
2010-10-02T10:14:27  <sigh> hi
2010-10-02T10:14:34  <medeman> uhmm
2010-10-02T10:15:30  <medeman> here (http://ai-contest.com/simple_strategy_guide.php) it says
2010-10-02T10:15:34  <medeman> down there
2010-10-02T10:15:51  <medeman> the thing with fleets in the air if you attacked then 1 if not 3
2010-10-02T10:16:00  <medeman> when i do it like that and compile
2010-10-02T10:16:26  <medeman> it gives me an symbol error
2010-10-02T10:16:29  <medeman> i have java version
2010-10-02T10:16:38  <medeman> and im using mac os x 10.6.4
2010-10-02T10:16:42  <medeman> why is that error?
2010-10-02T10:16:44  <sigh> does your PlanetWars class have a Production method?
2010-10-02T10:16:57  <medeman> i dunno im new
2010-10-02T10:16:57  <sigh> i think that was missing in the start packs
2010-10-02T10:17:06  <medeman> oh
2010-10-02T10:17:08  <medeman> how to add it=
2010-10-02T10:17:13  <medeman> ?
2010-10-02T10:17:28  <sigh> hang on, I'll check the java starter pack to be sure
2010-10-02T10:18:06  <medeman> okay thank you
2010-10-02T10:18:23  <antimatroid2> 6 wins to follow makes me feel a bit better
2010-10-02T10:18:31  <antimatroid2> but now i have to verse dmj
2010-10-02T10:18:36  <antimatroid2> that wont go well
2010-10-02T10:19:01  <sigh> medeman: look at the PlanetWars.java file in the examplebots folder, that has the production method
2010-10-02T10:19:35  <antimatroid2> no surprises there
2010-10-02T10:20:20  <medeman> ...
2010-10-02T10:20:54  <medeman> okay that means
2010-10-02T10:20:57  <medeman> ...
2010-10-02T10:21:10  <medeman> i change this:
2010-10-02T10:21:10  <medeman> if (pw.Production(1) >= pw.Production(2)) {
2010-10-02T10:21:14  <medeman> to this:
2010-10-02T10:21:26  <medeman> if (Production(1) >= Production(2)) {
2010-10-02T10:21:28  <medeman> ?
2010-10-02T10:22:00  <sigh> no, it means that you need to change PlanetWars.java to have a Production method
2010-10-02T10:22:09  <sigh> hmmm... they really should fix this :S
2010-10-02T10:23:12  <medeman> how to change it?
2010-10-02T10:23:14  <medeman> sorry im new
2010-10-02T10:24:48  <sigh> open example_bots/PlanetWars.java and copy the Production method into PlanetWars.java (I was going to tell you to copy the entire file, but it seems that it is also missing some methods)
2010-10-02T10:25:24  <medeman> okay
2010-10-02T10:26:18  <Migi32> antimatroid2, I've been reading up on Nash equilibria a bit, and I'd say there are 0 Nash equilibria in PlanetWars. What do you think?
2010-10-02T10:26:35  <medeman> hmm i cant find the production method
2010-10-02T10:26:40  <sigh> Migi32: wouldn't that depend on the map?
2010-10-02T10:26:55  <Migi32> sigh, well, there's a center planet in every map, so I guess not
2010-10-02T10:26:58  <sigh> medeman: line 221-229
2010-10-02T10:27:04  <antimatroid2> Migi32: there exists at least one mixed strategy nash equilibrium
2010-10-02T10:27:22  <Migi32> ah yes mixed strategy, with probabilities and so on
2010-10-02T10:27:29  <Migi32> didn't think of that
2010-10-02T10:27:57  <antimatroid2> one approach would be to try and have some kind of numerical approximation for one of those
2010-10-02T10:28:03  <antimatroid2> but i wouldn't even know where to begin
2010-10-02T10:28:10  <antimatroid2> and doubt you'd be able to get anything worth using
2010-10-02T10:28:24  <antimatroid2> but i intend to incorporate mixed strategies into my bot in a way
2010-10-02T10:29:15  <medeman> thats ship number
2010-10-02T10:29:18  <medeman> but not production

2010-10-02T10:32:23  <boegel> DanielVF: it's a lot less frequent though
2010-10-02T10:32:40  <DanielVF> Yeah. It's only running %10 of games
2010-10-02T10:32:52  <DanielVF> And I backed it down so it's got cpu to spare
2010-10-02T10:34:13  <sigh> medeman: sorry, I'm not sure how to help you then... the starter pack I just downloaded has a Production method on line 221 in "example_bots/PlanetWars.java"
2010-10-02T10:35:12  <Migi32> what I was thinking of doing was a sort of minimax search but instead of letting the players take turns, I'd do this: at each ply you have P1's possible moves and P2's possible moves, recursively find how good each "pair" of moves (a move being ALL the player's orders for that turn) is for each player, then a miracle occurs using Nash equilibrium magic and you get the EV of the move
2010-10-02T10:35:40  <antimatroid2> good luck with that :P
2010-10-02T10:35:41  <medeman> sigh thanks anyways

2010-10-02T10:36:12  <antimatroid2> you could throw together pure strategies and do minimax on the strategic version of that
2010-10-02T10:36:31  <antimatroid2> you can even use linear programming to solve for a mixed strategy nash equilibrium if you keep it zero sum
2010-10-02T10:36:46  <antimatroid2> it's a pain in the fucking ass to calculus msne for non-zero sum 2 player games
2010-10-02T10:37:09  <antimatroid2> i'm intending to do my maths honours thesis next year on calculating them for n-player non-zersum games
2010-10-02T10:37:16  <antimatroid2> you got me sigh :P
2010-10-02T10:37:36  <Migi32> should be possible to make a good zero-sum evaluation heuristic
2010-10-02T10:37:39  <sigh> medeman: here, I copied the method to pastebin for you: http://pastebin.com/XisH1TZA
2010-10-02T10:37:44  <sigh> antimatroid2: :P
2010-10-02T10:37:54  <medeman> thank you
2010-10-02T10:39:29  <Migi32> if nothing else: # P1 ships - # P2 ships + turns_left * ( P1 total growth - P2 total growth )
2010-10-02T10:39:33  <Migi32> that's zero-sum, right?
2010-10-02T10:40:01  *** smellyhippy <smellyhippy!~asmodean@about/csharp/regular/smellyhippy> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-02T10:40:40  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-02T10:41:16  <antimatroid2> payoff(player1, player2) =- payoff(player2, player1) just need that for all possible strategies
2010-10-02T10:41:29  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@91.182.173.227> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-10-02T10:41:55  <Migi32> but if there are 2 Nash equilibria, each with a different payoff for P1, is that possible? if so, what would be the total payoff for P1?
2010-10-02T10:42:22  <antimatroid2> multiple nash equilibria are possible, you can only play one, if you find many pick the best
2010-10-02T10:42:32  <antimatroid2> you might want to pseudo randomise over multiple best choices
2010-10-02T10:42:39  <antimatroid2> lest someone try to predict you using one of them
2010-10-02T10:43:37  <Migi32> they can predict me all they want, if it's a real Nash equilibrium they can't do anything better than play out that move
2010-10-02T10:44:02  <antimatroid2> depeds on whether it's strict or not (i think)
2010-10-02T10:44:09  <medeman> gtg
2010-10-02T10:44:10  <medeman> bye
2010-10-02T10:44:18  <antimatroid2> and even then, is it a nash equilibria in which you are at least drawing?
2010-10-02T10:44:23  <Migi32> bye
2010-10-02T10:44:29  <Migi32> you mean strong instead of strict?
2010-10-02T10:44:30  <antimatroid2> if you start from a draw state, sure
2010-10-02T10:44:32  <antimatroid2> otherwise?

2010-10-02T10:47:57  <antimatroid2> strong/strict is interchangeable is it not?

2010-10-02T10:49:00  <Migi32> :P
2010-10-02T10:49:14  <Migi32> that's why I asked

2010-10-02T10:50:23  <antimatroid2> basically it's struct if u(si*, s-i*) > u(si', s-i*) for all si' != si*

2010-10-02T14:13:43  <Nachtaktiv> I thought about sending 1 ship fleets out to every planet every round when I lose ^^
2010-10-02T14:14:06  <McLeopold> so "gg" would be 2 fleet-2 fleet-1 fleet pause 2 fleet-2 fleet-1 fleet
2010-10-02T14:14:11  <Nachtaktiv> Or save up on fleets for a crushing defeat when I win.
2010-10-02T14:14:13  <boegel> Nachtaktiv: if you have enough fleets left :P
2010-10-02T14:14:18  <McLeopold> that's 7 turns and 10 fleets
2010-10-02T14:14:46  <McLeopold> I think I could detect a loss with that amount of time left.
2010-10-02T14:14:53  <Sylph> lol nice firework on voipdptr

2010-10-02T14:20:42  <Frontier> Does anyone do crazy data management, like splitting fleets into smaller objects, maybe down to a one-object-per-ship model?
2010-10-02T14:22:21  <antimatroid2> my fleets are done as a vector for each planet
2010-10-02T14:22:32  <antimatroid2> i only care about the arrival time and where it lands
2010-10-02T14:22:44  <antimatroid2> all similar ones like that are merged into one from each player
2010-10-02T14:23:08  <Frontier> Me too, that was the forst thing for me: drop total_time, remaining_time and source and replace it by an ETA
2010-10-02T14:23:43  <antimatroid2> i don't even have a fleet class, it's just a vector<vector<vector<int> > > :P
2010-10-02T14:23:56  <Frontier> So you have an anti-denial-of-service bot that removes 0-fleets and merges similar 1-fleets?

2010-10-02T14:24:36  <antimatroid2> but it wouldn't change my code much, it's just adding 0 to a vlue
2010-10-02T14:25:06  <Frontier> Well.. you would still have 0 fleets around wouldnt you? and maybe a division by 0 somewhere that kills your bot ^^

2010-10-02T14:26:08  <antimatroid2> and yeah sure there are 0 sized fleets around
2010-10-02T14:26:31  <antimatroid2> my worst problem atm is i'm deleting elements from the start of vectors, i really need to fix that
2010-10-02T14:26:33  <Sylph> i thought the server got fixed
2010-10-02T14:26:40  <Sylph> to ignore size 0 fleets
2010-10-02T14:26:49  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-02T14:27:08  <Frontier> Till now I only worked with a simple vector<Fleet>. I think about verifying the game state I recieve right now and ... in case of an error send it to my computer for debugging ^^.
2010-10-02T14:27:36  <antimatroid2> i' trying to set up an approximate minimax tree now
2010-10-02T14:27:46  <antimatroid2> so i have to fix everything up to calculate things for either player
2010-10-02T14:27:47  <Frontier> The question was more like "did we forsee the problem and was our bot vulnerable"

2010-10-02T14:30:43  <Sylph> it only make sure it get the planet, but shortcircuit there and not consider the future turns.
2010-10-02T14:30:52  <Sylph> need to write the attack function

2010-10-02T14:31:32  <Sylph> just need to add a minor fix somewhere
2010-10-02T14:32:04  <Frontier> Yeah, I don't take change of ownership into account. So I send to few ships to defense, when the enemy gets the chance to capture the planet for 1 or more rounds.
2010-10-02T14:32:32  * Sylph nods
2010-10-02T14:32:50  <Sylph> my predictions take that into account, but not my attack function
2010-10-02T14:32:51  <Sylph> broken
2010-10-02T14:33:12  <Frontier> And when I plan on attacking an enemy planet I just add +5 to the planets production to be 'relatively' sure I get it - instead of tanking into account what the enemy could really send from its planets to defend.
2010-10-02T14:33:18  <Sylph> but so tired coding the framework, kinda lost my drive for the bot algorithm :p
2010-10-02T14:33:25  * Sylph nods
2010-10-02T14:33:43  <Sylph> mine take into account all that, but there are benefit or bad points on that.
2010-10-02T14:33:51  <jmcarthur> antimatroid2: a minimax tree? interesting
2010-10-02T14:34:13  <Frontier> So your bot is quite advanced. What ranking?
2010-10-02T14:34:18  <Sylph> no where yet
2010-10-02T14:34:20  <Sylph> it's a rewrite from scratch

2010-10-02T14:35:07  <Sylph> well, the attack function is done other than that bug
2010-10-02T14:35:19  <Sylph> then just need to work on finishing defend function, and front line stuff :/
2010-10-02T14:35:37  <Sylph> the framework is advanced, which actually makes it harder to code the bot
2010-10-02T14:35:42  <Sylph> >.<;;
2010-10-02T14:38:09  <Frontier> hmm. i am about to rewrite my bot with a great framework as well, but i guess i will write 50% of the functionality for the trash can and add code in the bot core algorithm that would have been nice in the framework, but doesnt really work with it. as i said my first try was a hackjob with one huge function, but went quick and did its job
2010-10-02T14:38:31  * Sylph nods
2010-10-02T14:38:55  <Frontier> I wonder if great frameworks are overrated. It's just a bot. How often will I use function X? Once, twice?
2010-10-02T14:39:22  <Sylph> when i enable my debugging, i get like 100k lines of log in 3-5 turns
2010-10-02T14:39:24  <krokokrusa> close one :) http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=276913
2010-10-02T14:39:29  <Sylph> most of that is from the framework
2010-10-02T14:39:41  <Sylph> so i use them functions a lot
2010-10-02T14:39:51  <Sylph> i just wish i haven't lost my drive after working on the framework,:p
2010-10-02T14:41:03  <Frontier> Did you write a logger for the bot or did you have one from previous projects or did you use log4cpp?
2010-10-02T14:41:15  <Sylph> i'm on c# and wrote a simple logger
2010-10-02T14:41:19  <Frontier> Or is it just the plain cerr <<?
2010-10-02T14:41:27  <Sylph> it's a plain console.write
2010-10-02T14:41:28  <Sylph> in C#

2010-10-02T14:43:52  <Sylph> :p
2010-10-02T14:45:20  <Frontier> The operator[] works out if the debugging level info is in use and if so returns an output stream that is backed by a specialized logging buffer. If not it returns a dummy stream with no buffer. The operator << is standard C++ stuff.
2010-10-02T14:46:21  <Frontier> Learning all that stuff about streams was so time consuming that I lost my drive now, too.

2010-10-02T14:48:05  <Sylph> so you keep a file stream open at all time?
2010-10-02T14:48:22  <Sylph> and just write when it dump?
2010-10-02T14:48:27  <Sylph> or write at all time
2010-10-02T14:48:38  <Frontier> well, it isn't done yet, but I want to open the files only when I actually write something into them
2010-10-02T14:48:47  * Sylph nods
2010-10-02T14:49:27  <Frontier> i have to write on every 'endl' (end-line) in case the program crashes or gets crashed by a certain server code that recently fixed 0 fleets

2010-10-02T15:01:59  <Sylph> yea, i haven't even gotten that far.

2010-10-02T16:00:25  <impomatic> krokokrusa: no, the GA are good making warriors for small memories (80 or 800 cells).
2010-10-02T16:00:27  <Sylph> still relatively simple from what I heard
2010-10-02T16:00:43  <Sylph> though people are working on more sophisticated bots
2010-10-02T16:00:49  <Zannick> sophistication is hard to program
2010-10-02T16:00:49  <FBP> hmm. Goodbye free time.
2010-10-02T16:00:54  <Sylph> yea
2010-10-02T16:01:12  <impomatic> But hand-written warriors are better in larger memories (and just as good in the small memories)

2010-10-02T16:02:12  <Sylph> nice
2010-10-02T16:02:26  <Sylph> mine only got to 300 in 2 days of work, though most of those work was not coding the bot itself
2010-10-02T16:02:27  <Frontier> FBP: It performes very well CPU time wise, because it doesn't predict much.
2010-10-02T16:02:46  <FBP> I think my first bot will probably just go with the "capture as many planets as possible and then evade conflict" strategy for my first.
2010-10-02T16:03:08  <Frontier> Sylph: I tried it on the tcp server and tuned it half a day.

2010-10-02T16:03:22  <FBP> Hmmm, which came first, Galcon or Eufloria (or whatever it was called when it was a prototype)?
2010-10-02T16:03:27  <Sylph> remember attacking enemy = enemy lose units, fbp
2010-10-02T16:03:29  <Sylph> Not sure
2010-10-02T16:03:33  <Sylph> i think eufloria was first?
2010-10-02T16:03:37  <Sylph> dyson
2010-10-02T16:03:41  <Sylph> was its original name

2010-10-02T16:04:18  <Sylph> that was the bot i coded in 1-2 day when i joined xd
2010-10-02T16:04:24  <Sylph> just extending starter kit
2010-10-02T16:04:38  <Sylph> only got to 300
2010-10-02T16:04:45  <Frontier> Sylph: download the tcp.c file and compile it (instructions come in the file)
2010-10-02T16:04:54  <Sylph> no need, i already got access to the tcp stuff
2010-10-02T16:05:03  <Sylph> through the tcp.exe someone compiled already, so don't need to compile more
2010-10-02T16:05:18  <greghaynes> oo, I should make a .exe for the gui

2010-10-02T16:11:27  <krokokrusa> it's hard to maintain 3k lines of java code without packages :)
2010-10-02T16:11:28  <MarcAndrePC> any easy way to do that except moving everything to the default package and then remove package and import line?
2010-10-02T16:11:44  <MarcAndrePC> yea I think the same thing
2010-10-02T16:11:55  <krokokrusa> i'm using Eclipse, just drag'n'dropping everything to the default package

2010-10-02T16:12:50  <boegel> when one allied and one hostile fleet arrive in the same turn with the same number of ships on a non-neutral, nothing changes, right?
2010-10-02T16:12:52  <MarcAndrePC> hmmm I delete the old package after I move them, that give me an error with the import...
2010-10-02T16:13:06  <MarcAndrePC> if I leave the import there is it a problem?

2010-10-02T16:19:25  <Zannick> it increases
2010-10-02T16:19:28  <Zannick> very fast
2010-10-02T16:19:36  <Sylph> exponentially :p
2010-10-02T16:19:40  <Zannick> i figured out the formula this morning

2010-10-02T16:20:03  <krokokrusa> I'm just trying to say that better bot should use full second for thinking
2010-10-02T16:20:26  <MarcAndrePC> what I realise is that's it's usually the defensive function and the taking neutral function that make a big difference
2010-10-02T16:20:41  <MarcAndrePC> any offensive move I make doesn't make much change
2010-10-02T16:20:44  <Zannick> for each player, the number of possible sets of orders that can be made is the product over each planet they own of C(planet.num_ships + num_planets - 1, num_planets - 1)

2010-10-02T16:20:51  <Zannick> where C is the choose function
2010-10-02T16:21:29  <Zannick> er
2010-10-02T16:21:38  <Zannick> 5151 is for a simple 3-planet case
2010-10-02T16:21:41  <Zannick> sorry
2010-10-02T16:21:53  <Zannick> the actual number is 122 choose 22.
2010-10-02T16:22:17  <Zannick> which is 9.41388x10^23
2010-10-02T16:23:01  <Frontier> another cool number: 21 planets with 3 possible owners = 3^21 = 10,460,353,203 possible game states (ignoring ships and population)
2010-10-02T16:23:09  <Zannick> i thought that number seemed a bit low...
2010-10-02T16:23:44  <boegel> DanielVF: can you check out this game? http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5257040
2010-10-02T16:24:07  <boegel> DanielVF: I suspect my adversary just crashed because it had no more planets left, but I just want to make sure... :)

2010-10-02T16:25:03  <boegel> MarcAndrePC: I agree, I'm ranked ~250, but my offense really sucks
2010-10-02T16:25:11  <Frontier> You can reduce your number by saying that planets are only attacked with enough ships
2010-10-02T16:25:14  <krokokrusa> boegel: I think this game is a clear win
2010-10-02T16:25:16  <boegel> MarcAndrePC: defense and conquering is decent
2010-10-02T16:25:33  <boegel> krokokrusa: yeah, but in the last turn, he should be regaining two planets, but the game ends
2010-10-02T16:25:37  <krokokrusa> 51 turn show opponent's two remaining fleets dying
2010-10-02T16:25:41  <Frontier> boegel: don't call that an opponent, it was clearly depressive and commiting suicide Oo
2010-10-02T16:25:49  <krokokrusa> no, you forgot to account for planet's growths
2010-10-02T16:25:49  <Sylph> did you count planet growth, boegel?
2010-10-02T16:25:53  <boegel> Frontier: :)

2010-10-02T16:51:57  <Frontier> They should keep your previous ranking when you upload a new bot and start from there :)
2010-10-02T16:52:05  <Sylph> many says that :p
2010-10-02T16:52:25  <Sylph> especially since you can test out your bot on the tcp and local visualizer anyway
2010-10-02T16:52:30  <Sylph> so no reason for your bot to get any worse
2010-10-02T16:52:37  <Sylph> and dumped to rank 2k again
2010-10-02T16:52:45  <jmcarthur> it can't work that way with bayeselo
2010-10-02T16:53:07  <Frontier> explain pls :)
2010-10-02T16:53:58  <jmcarthur> it runs as a batch, counting all games for all submissions at once. new submissions are (rightly) treated as distinct from old one so that old games don't affect your score positively or negatively. since it's a batch, this is really the only way to do it
2010-10-02T16:54:06  <jmcarthur> you can't gradually phase out the affects of old games over time
2010-10-02T16:54:10  <jmcarthur> *effects
2010-10-02T16:54:41  <Sylph> I guess it might cause new games find it harder to increase in rank?
2010-10-02T16:54:45  <Sylph> mm
2010-10-02T16:54:48  <Sylph> new bots i mean
2010-10-02T16:54:54  <Sylph> compared to old ones, because of previous fights
2010-10-02T16:54:57  <jmcarthur> imagine you have 100 games on an old version of your bot and then you upload a new one
2010-10-02T16:55:17  <jmcarthur> if you count all those old games too then your rank is basically meaningless
2010-10-02T16:55:57  * Sylph nods
2010-10-02T16:56:11  <Sylph> making it harder and harder to move from the old rank
2010-10-02T16:56:16  <Sylph> the more you play/upload new bots
2010-10-02T16:56:27  <jmcarthur> and since it's a batch, you can't just keep some score around between submissions. such a persistent score simply doesn't exist
2010-10-02T16:56:36  <Sylph> But any way to show the old fights so we can still watch them? Maybe separate windows, since they're not deleted
2010-10-02T16:56:41  <Sylph> separate page i mean
2010-10-02T16:56:49  <Sylph> ah
2010-10-02T16:56:51  <jmcarthur> in fact, the scores before the rank update and after it are unrelated
2010-10-02T16:57:52  <jmcarthur> if i wanted to save replays from old versions of my bot i would bookmark or download them before submitting a new bot
2010-10-02T16:58:18  <jmcarthur> it would be convenient to have those available from your profile, but i don't know that it would be worth the trouble to implement that

2010-10-02T16:59:14  <Sylph> yeah
2010-10-02T16:59:42  <Sylph> still, not very convenient for seeing other people's previous fights

2010-10-02T18:44:23  <Frontier> Almighty, I just finished finding a 1 hour bug hunt around a single line of code. I was deleting in a list from the current iterator position like this:
2010-10-02T18:44:23  <Frontier> it_waiting == m_waiting_entries.erase(it_waiting);
2010-10-02T18:44:49  <Frontier> Somehow it would crash on the second iteration of the loop
2010-10-02T18:45:33  <Frontier> Then I saw the debugger step into operator== and I was like "No! Did I ?!!?....."
2010-10-02T18:46:20  <u1tr0n> :D

2010-10-02T18:49:23  <nullkuhl> hello, i have made an account for myself on ai-contest.com website, however i didnt do any submission yet and i would like to create a new account for a team as i decided to join with some friends, am not sure if i must delete my own account then ( as i have never used it )
2010-10-02T18:50:24  <Frontier> nullkuhl: the admin is not online right now
2010-10-02T18:50:49  <nullkuhl> Frontier: what is his nick ? do you have any idea how can i delete my account ?
2010-10-02T18:51:15  <Frontier> I guess if you didn't make any submissions they wont rip off your head and just delete you old account. The admins nick is amstan here.

2010-10-02T18:54:33  <Sylph> may want to confirm though
2010-10-02T18:54:45  <Sylph> I read somewhere about not allowing someone to have more than one account
2010-10-02T18:55:25  <Sylph> i don't know if that extend to team, or unused account (of which they might not really think much about considering its usage)
2010-10-02T18:55:53  <Zannick> you aren't supposed to have multiple accounts
2010-10-02T18:56:10  <Sylph> yeah exactly
2010-10-02T18:56:15  <Zannick> so you can't do individual and team

2010-10-02T23:15:31  <antimatroid2> it's getting more competitive every damn day
2010-10-02T23:17:22  <MarcAndrePC> yup
2010-10-02T23:17:32  <MarcAndrePC> mostly out of idea right now :(
2010-10-02T23:18:01  <antimatroid2> really? i have too many
2010-10-02T23:18:15  <MarcAndrePC> well I had a lot
2010-10-02T23:18:27  <MarcAndrePC> but I tried some and it didn't give good result at all
2010-10-02T23:18:32  <antimatroid2> i'm currently trying to set up to sort of approximate a game tree to run minimax on
2010-10-02T23:18:43  <MarcAndrePC> so now I'm rethinking a lot of good idea...
2010-10-02T23:18:47  <antimatroid2> no idea how that'll go, i think it'll largely depend on how well one picks possible combinations of moves
2010-10-02T23:19:10  <antimatroid2> i tried dynamic programming, but there's just too many possible moves
2010-10-02T23:19:21  <MarcAndrePC> I guess, if you manage to reduce the number of possible move you can work it out
2010-10-02T23:19:38  <MarcAndrePC> what's your rank?
2010-10-02T23:19:39  <antimatroid2> yeah, but it's still hard to do that
2010-10-02T23:19:48  <antimatroid2> "youwillfail"
2010-10-02T23:19:52  <antimatroid2> not sure where it's at now

2010-10-02T23:20:33  <antimatroid2> i beat you earlier it seems :P
2010-10-02T23:20:41  <MarcAndrePC> yea yea gj
2010-10-02T23:20:58  <MarcAndrePC> that's one mistake I need to change
2010-10-02T23:21:08  <MarcAndrePC> dont send too many ship at the begin
2010-10-02T23:21:22  <antimatroid2> i basically just counter for rage bot like tactics
2010-10-02T23:21:28  <antimatroid2> in that if planets all attacked me i have enough left
2010-10-02T23:21:37  <antimatroid2> i do this on any move for planets that need it
2010-10-02T23:21:42  <MarcAndrePC> hmmm and it work?
2010-10-02T23:21:45  <antimatroid2> if possible anyway
2010-10-02T23:22:24  <MarcAndrePC> I just have a simple protection home vs home when we both have only 1 planet, it protects against rage bot but I guess it needs to be more general
2010-10-02T23:22:51  <antimatroid2> yeah, depends on how much the planet is worth to you i guess

2010-10-02T23:23:20  <antimatroid2> not every planet

2010-10-02T23:23:46  <MarcAndrePC> oh, but it's hard to find those that can't be backed up in time
2010-10-02T23:24:53  <antimatroid2> i'm hardly using any time at all so far
2010-10-02T23:25:48  <MarcAndrePC> like your 1 second limit?
2010-10-02T23:26:20  <antimatroid2> yep
2010-10-02T23:26:25  <MarcAndrePC> me neither, some turn are slower than other but I guess it's just strange bug in java like always (or me doing bad programming :) )
2010-10-02T23:26:27  <antimatroid2> sometimes it'll use over 0.01
2010-10-02T23:26:36  <antimatroid2> i'm using c++ :)

2010-10-02T23:27:51  <antimatroid2> both have made it quite horrid aha
2010-10-02T23:29:13  <MarcAndrePC> oh I have another week point, I try to take neutral closer to enemy home than my home at the begin, not very wise...
2010-10-02T23:29:23  <MarcAndrePC> weak*
2010-10-02T23:30:10  <MarcAndrePC> enemy just counter with fewer ship and take it...
2010-10-02T23:30:36  <antimatroid2> aha yeah, shouldn't do that :P

2010-10-02T23:31:16  <MarcAndrePC> the problem is when I shouldn't do that and when I should
2010-10-02T23:31:47  <MarcAndrePC> like farther in the game, if I have a good position I should take neutral around me even if they are close to enemy home
2010-10-02T23:32:47  <MarcAndrePC> any easy way to find out if a neutral planet is ''secure'' to attack?
2010-10-02T23:33:36  <antimatroid2> if you have a good enough position to do that it probably doesn't matter if you don't :P
2010-10-02T23:33:43  <antimatroid2> just go in for the kill already
2010-10-02T23:34:30  <antimatroid2> i don't tend to really care about tactics for when i'm winning or losing
2010-10-02T23:34:40  <antimatroid2> i act like i'm fighting on equal terms always
2010-10-02T23:34:53  <antimatroid2> under the assumption that if it's winning it's going to win now anyway and if i'm losing wel fuck it
2010-10-02T23:35:28  <antimatroid2> although it would be nice to have a function that executes a win as soon as it's pretty sure it can
2010-10-02T23:36:42  <u1tr0n> if (your_distance_for_neutral_planet < enimy_distance_for_neutral_planet) send neutral+1 ships and check all enimy fleets if fleed->DestinationPlanet == your_netral_planet send there same count of ships
2010-10-02T23:37:39  <MarcAndrePC> hmmm not bad ultr0n
2010-10-02T23:38:03  <u1tr0n> if (your_distance_for_neutral_planet > enimy_distance_for_neutral_planet) then count all ships on planets where distanse less and send neutralships+sum(enimy_nears_ships)
2010-10-02T23:38:58  <antimatroid2> i try to estiamte an amount needed to claim and protect any neutral that is between me and them
2010-10-02T23:39:08  <antimatroid2> same with claiming them
2010-10-02T23:39:27  <MarcAndrePC> yup I guess that could work

2010-10-02T23:58:58  <j3camero> So I noticed there has been a bit of turbulence at the top of leaderboard as of late.
2010-10-02T23:59:25  <j3camero> I guess people have been working hard on their bots!
