2010-10-17T02:18:36  <bhasker> are any of the top bots tree based?
2010-10-17T02:18:41  <bhasker> or are all of them heuristic based?

2010-10-17T02:32:34  <deepblue> it's mostly tweaks
2010-10-17T02:32:42  <deepblue> some new stuff is hopefully finished tomorrow
2010-10-17T02:32:55  <rebelxt_> just started mine too with some cool regressions ;-)
2010-10-17T02:33:31  <deepblue> yay
2010-10-17T02:35:17  <rebelxt_> nice to see some "official" cloud servers playing games. was it j3camero who got 'em started?

2010-10-17T02:41:21  <McLeopold> Looks like I'm going the distance with Meatkat...
2010-10-17T02:41:58  <deepblue> and I clearly have some issues to sort out
2010-10-17T02:42:05  <McLeopold> I'm always stressed out waiting for results.  I need to not watch...
2010-10-17T02:42:17  <McLeopold> Oh crap, malazan.
2010-10-17T02:42:23  <McLeopold> Oh, win.  That was fast.

2010-10-17T02:45:41  <McLeopold> so far.  I haven't played you yet.
2010-10-17T02:45:47  <McLeopold> Nor rebelxt
2010-10-17T02:46:02  <McLeopold> And I'm getting favorable maps.
2010-10-17T02:46:03  <deepblue> i just restarted my script todo another 50 games
2010-10-17T02:46:13  <deepblue> oh yeah
2010-10-17T02:46:24  <deepblue> I have some early game issues on some maps
2010-10-17T02:46:39  <deepblue> that leave me with a disadvantage and lead to losses
2010-10-17T02:46:42  <bhasker> i am trying to fix some bugs on my bot
2010-10-17T02:46:47  <bhasker> but sadly introducing new ones :-\
2010-10-17T02:47:03  <McLeopold> It's tough.  On close starts, you need to react.  Far away, you need to build fast.
2010-10-17T02:47:48  <McLeopold> center throw at it's best.  :D  http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=529806

2010-10-17T07:55:04  <fluffluff> yeah, sounds reasonable
2010-10-17T07:55:28  <gerald512k> ok thanks. cause the bot runs good on my local machine and on official server, but this server cannont run it :(
2010-10-17T07:56:46  <fluffluff> I've got the opposite problem. runs fine on tcp but crashes 9 times out of 10 on the official... :)
2010-10-17T07:57:10  <gerald512k> very weird :) apprently it is a problem on my command line since prospectorbot doesnt wrk neither, but thx for info

2010-10-17T08:02:51  <fluffluff> if you download cygwin you can compile tcp.c and get a much nicer tcp.exe. or, if you trust strangers, I can email it to you

2010-10-17T08:34:42  <delt0r___> you pick 2 bots and a map

2010-10-17T08:35:59  <gerald512k> i tried the tcp.exe, but i can't launch my bot throudh "java -jar MyBot.jar", wich is in the same directory that tcp. And mybot.jar works fine on local machine :(
2010-10-17T08:36:34  <delt0r___> with tcp.exe you really do need  a script file to run your bot
2010-10-17T08:36:47  <gerald512k> ho ok like a .bat

2010-10-17T08:50:11  <phreeza> so if there are 2 cloud servers online like yesterday, meaning 50games/minute, a complete round robin with the amount of bots we have now would take close to 3 months... for a single map!

2010-10-17T08:53:53  <phreeza> hm what then?
2010-10-17T08:53:55  <delt0r___> also i think that there may be some sort of "starter pack" bot filter...

2010-10-17T08:54:35  <phreeza> maybe there could be a round robin for the final 100 or so
2010-10-17T08:54:55  <phreeza> ah ok
2010-10-17T08:54:57  <delt0r___> but then the odd outsider get a game will a top bot...

2010-10-17T12:47:42  <fluffluff> a nice way of generating unique names? what's down with it?
2010-10-17T12:48:27  <phreeza> dunno just seems weird
2010-10-17T12:50:51  <janzert> I believe they're git revision hashes or whatever git calls 'em

2010-10-17T15:47:08  <p4p4> hey, came back for a last  question today, - what would be a good metrics to see if my bot improved, like number of turns it took to win ?
2010-10-17T15:47:37  <deepblue> elo score on the tcp server
2010-10-17T15:47:38  <fluffluff> ranking on tcp seems like a decent metric :)
2010-10-17T15:47:44  <deepblue> ^^
2010-10-17T15:47:53  <deepblue> also good is
2010-10-17T15:48:02  <deepblue> could I beat my previous version?
2010-10-17T15:48:13  <deepblue> and still beat the standard example bots
2010-10-17T15:48:24  <p4p4> ;) obviously
2010-10-17T15:48:34  <deepblue> also important 'can it still beat all my previous versions'
2010-10-17T15:48:43  <deepblue> (which I'm fighting with all the time)
2010-10-17T15:49:10  <Mathnerd314> so is anyone near optimal strategy yet?
2010-10-17T15:49:37  <Lithosphere> if it beats my previous versions more than 50% of the games, i'll reupload it most of the time
2010-10-17T15:49:48  <fluffluff> sure, for sufficiently large epsilons
2010-10-17T15:52:56  <Mathnerd314> so... no?
2010-10-17T15:53:07  <Migi32> Mathnerd314, no where near.
2010-10-17T15:53:09  <fluffluff> probably not
2010-10-17T15:53:18  <Migi32> I think
2010-10-17T15:53:32  <Migi32> it's hard to tell of course what the "optimal strategy" is
2010-10-17T15:54:07  <Migi32> but bots keep improving at an amazing rate, which suggests a no

2010-10-17T15:55:43  <Mathnerd314> it's only 200 moves... infinite lookahead shouldn't be too hard
2010-10-17T15:57:19  <Mathnerd314> but I keep having to decide between life and the AI contest, and life keeps winning :-/
2010-10-17T15:57:34  <deepblue> i can tell you
2010-10-17T15:58:04  <deepblue> 1sec is not enought for even close to do any serious amount of lookahead in a brute force way
2010-10-17T15:58:43  <Mathnerd314> I guess it depends on what you're brute-forcing
2010-10-17T15:59:28  <Mathnerd314> if you're doing individual ships/fleets, it probably is slow
2010-10-17T15:59:52  <Migi32> Mathnerd314, 200 moves is much in chess, I can tell you it's way more in PlanetWars
2010-10-17T16:00:16  <Migi32> it only feels less because we humans have better intuition for PlanetWars than chess
2010-10-17T16:01:36  <Mathnerd314> but planets are often 5-10 moves apart. so it's more like 20 moves of chess

2010-10-17T21:31:58  <amstan> there's still games being played on the main server from what i see
2010-10-17T21:32:15  <Naktibalda> it's a counter of "my games"
2010-10-17T21:33:27  <Naktibalda> no new games in last 2 hours
2010-10-17T21:34:25  <amstan> how many games do you have in total?
2010-10-17T21:34:27  <Naktibalda> actually, 2 games in 21 hour
2010-10-17T21:35:04  <Naktibalda> too lazy too count. submitted a week ago
2010-10-17T21:35:11  <Naktibalda> to count

2010-10-17T22:23:53  <GigabyteJas> Hi AiChallengers - is anyone else having problems when the server tries to compile C#?
2010-10-17T22:24:06  <janzert> yes, unfortunately
2010-10-17T22:24:38  <GigabyteJas> has anyone heard from the server team about a fix?
2010-10-17T22:25:11  <janzert> unfortunately not as yet, the server team has sorta run out of people available lately
2010-10-17T22:25:18  <janzert> hopefully that will be changing soon

2010-10-17T22:26:37  <GigabyteJas> Hopefully - my bot is dominating the starter kit bots, but I don't think that will be the case with some real competition =p Anyhow - thanks for the update! Good to know it's not me
2010-10-17T22:27:06  <janzert> in the mean time you would probably really benefit by playing on the tcp server
2010-10-17T22:27:11  <janzert> #tcpserver
2010-10-17T22:27:12  <contestbot> janzert: tcpserver = http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/
2010-10-17T22:27:38  <janzert> at least that way you can get a bunch of games in against some of the best bots in the contest
2010-10-17T22:27:52  <GigabyteJas> wow - i had completely missed that. awesome

2010-10-17T23:41:29  <dhaval> looks like it's an input to some elo calculation program, but I can't find that part in the source
2010-10-17T23:47:01  <Mathnerd314> I know some other people have done it and put a guide on the forum somewhere.
2010-10-17T23:47:45  <dhaval> oh great, I tried searching for that but I couldn't find it. I'll give that another go.
