2010-12-03T00:14:09  <sigh> it's funny the sense of entitlement some people have, especially when the idea is such a huge departure from what the contest is about

2010-12-03T00:28:09  <antimatroid1> a1l0n have you tried mapping things like isnt to isn't?
2010-12-03T00:28:10  <a1k0n> now that's a challenge.  hmm
2010-12-03T00:28:19  <a1k0n> nope, not yet
2010-12-03T00:28:49  <antimatroid1> one could thing would be to branch a tree of possible word cut offs? then try to evalutate terminal setences as to which is most likely valid?
2010-12-03T00:28:56  <antimatroid1> cool* thing

2010-12-03T00:29:32  <a1k0n> it uses a 6-character-gram model, and dynamic programming ot find the maximum likelihood parsing
2010-12-03T00:29:35  <a1k0n> runs in linear time
2010-12-03T00:29:36  <antimatroid1> i have no idea how one would evaluate that, validity of the grammer stuff etc. perhaps?
2010-12-03T00:29:50  <a1k0n> so if you can come up with a better language model, it'd use it
2010-12-03T00:29:53  <sigh> ah ok, makes sense
2010-12-03T00:30:11  <epona> so is the branching technique in coding the superior way to make educated decisions?
2010-12-03T00:30:22  <a1k0n> what's kinda cool is the language model is hashed into (insert size here) space, with a pretty smooth degradation of performance as you shrink down the weights
2010-12-03T00:30:24  <antimatroid1> that tree thing would suck with large blocks of text,but could possibly be run on individual sentences?
2010-12-03T00:30:34  <burny> the branching technique?
2010-12-03T00:30:36  <sigh> antimatroid1: look into markov-chains
2010-12-03T00:30:42  <sigh> that's what a1k0n is using
2010-12-03T00:30:45  <antimatroid1> i know what markov chains are :P
2010-12-03T00:30:56  <antimatroid1> why don't people just say that :P
2010-12-03T00:30:59  <a1k0n> yeah, i've implemented that sort of thing before.  you can do dynamic programming on (tree context, rest of string)
2010-12-03T00:31:15  <sigh> Viterbi algorithm, I think?
2010-12-03T00:31:18  <a1k0n> but then you absolutely have to have every word in your dictionary
2010-12-03T00:31:18  <sigh> is that right?
2010-12-03T00:31:28  <a1k0n> yeah, it might be equivalent to viterbi, i hadn't thought of that
2010-12-03T00:31:44  <epona> burny:the technique bocsimacko used
2010-12-03T00:31:48  <antimatroid1> what does it do now? pick words then make words out of anything left?
2010-12-03T00:32:29  <a1k0n> given the (up to) five letters in a word, what's the likelihood of the letter under consideration?  what's the likelihood of a word break here, and then starting a new word from here?
2010-12-03T00:32:36  <a1k0n> five is an adjustable parameter of course
2010-12-03T00:32:50  <a1k0n> the training is done on my collection of plaintext ebooks for my kindle..
2010-12-03T00:33:02  <sigh> train it on the channel logs :P
2010-12-03T00:33:14  <a1k0n> heh.  could do that.
2010-12-03T00:34:12  <a1k0n> anyway it's a neat little algorithm.  nothing new, just kinda cool that it runs in linear time.
2010-12-03T00:34:21  <sigh> :)
2010-12-03T00:34:54  <epona> a1k0n, may I see it?

2010-12-03T01:15:45  <burny> make a maxmax tree then :P

2010-12-03T01:20:12  <sigh> fair enough
2010-12-03T01:20:34  <antimatroid1> give the bots 10 seconds and they could be a lot better
2010-12-03T01:21:38  <sigh> don't like that, the games become too long so harder to test and can't play as many games
2010-12-03T01:21:48  <antimatroid1> yeah i don't want to do it
2010-12-03T01:22:55  <antimatroid1> if i had more time, i would probably use decision tree's at each node inside the minimax tree to pick moves for each player, and actually increment states

2010-12-03T10:22:54  <Frontier> Oh nice, that is closely related to my ideas based on the old RoboCom game: each robot/and runs it's own copy of the code. Does the code run as Python/C/Haskel/... or is it a virtual machine?

2010-12-03T10:32:52  <antimatroid> i would make the radius of vision for each bot discrete
2010-12-03T10:33:07  <antimatroid> like you can see a bot that is on a square with a min path to is <= x
2010-12-03T10:34:37  <antimatroid> hmmm what about everybody edits, but you both start at the bottom and it's a race to the top?
2010-12-03T10:37:05  <antimatroid> http://everybodyedits.com/
2010-12-03T10:38:07  <Frontier> how about a second, lager radius that only gives you the information that there IS a drone, but now which team it is on? :)
2010-12-03T10:38:07  <Frontier> Damn I would give all my drones clear orders so they all still know where they will linger after a few turns. Nothing worse than finding an enemy drone and not knowing where the support is.
2010-12-03T10:40:32  <antimatroid> once you know where two are in relation to each other, you can store a said information and track where they are in relation to each other
2010-12-03T10:40:35  <antimatroid> that can't be prevented
2010-12-03T10:40:51  <antimatroid> i'm not really sure how to do it with a grid either
2010-12-03T10:41:06  <antimatroid> if you provide details of your bots locations, you know where they are in relation to each other

2010-12-03T11:50:08  <Error323> you do realize its RTS? ;)

2010-12-03T11:50:31  <Error323> well it is :P
2010-12-03T11:50:32  <Mistmanov> rts is more one supreme commander giving all the commands
2010-12-03T11:50:37  <Mistmanov> in my view anyway
2010-12-03T11:50:44  <Mistmanov> this is more simulating emergent behavior as found in nature
2010-12-03T11:50:45  *** holmar <holmar!~holmar@89-160-163-48.du.xdsl.is> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-03T11:50:47  <Mistmanov> completely different ;)
2010-12-03T11:51:19  <Error323> well in this case the ai programmer is the supreme commander :P
2010-12-03T11:51:26  <Mistmanov> biggest problem would be getting the parameters right so they allow interesting beneficial tactics
2010-12-03T11:51:45  <Mistmanov> if you get the parameters wrong, there's a big chance that full on defense of full on offense is the ideal solution
2010-12-03T11:52:10  <Mistmanov> *or full on offense
2010-12-03T11:52:37  <Error323> yes it needs a good balance
2010-12-03T11:52:47  <meneky_> Error323: but comm restriction makes the commander not to be absolutely on command :P , i agree mistmanov, more like an emergent behaviour game, and i really like the idea
2010-12-03T11:52:54  <Mistmanov> what you want is that you need to band together for defense, but that raiding parties still have a chance of slipping in to destroy eggs if the perimeter is defended poorly etc
2010-12-03T11:53:59  <janzert> I'd like to say that while I rather like the idea of multiple independent agents for the player, trying to run a player's program every time for each agent with potentially many, many agents is going to end up a nightmare
2010-12-03T11:54:19  <Mistmanov> yeah, that's the big disadvantage
2010-12-03T11:54:43  <Mistmanov> something like 100 drones per player would be cool, but then you can't do 1 sec per drone per turn
2010-12-03T11:55:14  <Mistmanov> (and I don't know enough about computers to know if running 200 programs at the same time is a problem anyway)
2010-12-03T11:55:45  <Error323> well on 100 per player its a lot more
2010-12-03T11:56:21  <Error323> but with sth like 5 or 10 as max, interesting behavior and a real challenge is already created
2010-12-03T11:56:34  <janzert> I should write a post just describing what would be good features for a game from a technical point of view from what I'm seeing with the current contest

2010-12-03T11:57:51  <Error323> well it depends on the quality of a single game win/loss
2010-12-03T11:58:13  <Error323> if thats really high then much less games are required for scoring
2010-12-03T11:58:21  <Mistmanov> would it help if the players just wrote a function that handles all the stuff, and then the server runs a single program that just executes that function once for every drone?
2010-12-03T11:59:11  <janzert> how do you prevent the player from having global state?
2010-12-03T11:59:15  <meneky_> i you run 2 or 3 games for each player simultaneusly you can spawn x processes per game and player, and call each process with the a random drone of any of the 3 games, with that you can almost ensure that no global info can be stored (restricted comm), the only problem is that you cannot keep info from turn to turn.
2010-12-03T12:00:17  <janzert> shouldn't a drone be able to have persistent memory throughout the game?
2010-12-03T12:00:24  <Mistmanov> yeah I think they should
2010-12-03T12:00:39  <Mistmanov> that way if you want to calculate something really complicated
2010-12-03T12:00:49  <Mistmanov> you could just decide to just calculate for a few turns
2010-12-03T12:01:31  <janzert> I think between persistent memory and not wanting 'side-band' communication among the drones you would be forced to have separate programs for each drone :(
2010-12-03T12:02:00  <Mistmanov> hmm :(
2010-12-03T12:02:08  <meneky_> yep,it looks like too heavy load
2010-12-03T12:02:25  <Mistmanov> convince google to sponsor you with giant datacenters

2010-12-03T12:02:42  <Error323> instead of just name -.-
2010-12-03T12:03:36  <janzert> Error323: my understanding now is that it turns out google does supply money as well although I don't know what sort of budget
2010-12-03T12:03:51  <Error323> oh cool
2010-12-03T12:04:22  <janzert> yeah, I was happy to learn that
2010-12-03T12:04:37  <Mistmanov> On the other hand.. forcing the drones to do all their calculations in short turns (say less than 100 ms) would also be a nice challenge
2010-12-03T12:04:51  <Mistmanov> but I don't know how much that puts some languages at a disadvantage
2010-12-03T12:05:03  <Error323> 100ms is very very little :/
2010-12-03T12:05:08  <Error323> a second is already very little
2010-12-03T12:05:29  <meneky_> 100 ms is a huge interval in c++ :P
2010-12-03T12:05:32  <Mistmanov> true, but ants sure seem to do well with little processing power
2010-12-03T12:06:14  <meneky_> what about reducir further the number of drones (say 20) and reducing the time for each (say 100 ms per turn) at the same time?
2010-12-03T12:06:32  <Error323> I don't know what kind of processing power they have tbh, but a few billion years of evolution also helped :P
2010-12-03T12:06:32  <meneky_> no new egg will convert to a drone if the maximun is reached
2010-12-03T12:06:49  <antimatroid> janzert: can you give each player 1 core?
2010-12-03T12:06:56  <antimatroid> and then run as many instances as necessary?
2010-12-03T12:07:02  <antimatroid> that would be completely fair if feasible
2010-12-03T12:07:24  <janzert> probably not
2010-12-03T12:07:25  <Error323> the OS handles the scheduling
2010-12-03T12:07:38  <Migi32> ahhh, reading mega1's post-mortem kinda hurts. I did the "full attack based evaluation function" almost exactly the same as him, but when executing it it didn't perform well. It didn't occur to me that I could just let it ignore neutrals to make it work...
2010-12-03T12:08:29  <antimatroid> Mistmanov: in your image, you went with a discrete map but continuous radius? :P
2010-12-03T12:08:38  <antimatroid> wouldn't it be better to have the radius be discrete too
2010-12-03T12:08:44  <Mistmanov> yeah
2010-12-03T12:08:52  <Mistmanov> but contious radius was 1 click with a big brush
2010-12-03T12:08:53  <Mistmanov> :p
2010-12-03T12:08:59  <antimatroid> :P
2010-12-03T12:09:03  <janzert> if it wasn't for trying to include as many programming languages as possible I'd say have the drones run an artificial bytecode specific to the contest
2010-12-03T12:09:17  <janzert> that the engine would directly interpret
2010-12-03T12:09:43  <janzert> and the drone time slice can be so many bytecodes
2010-12-03T12:09:44  <meneky_> janzert: have you read Frontier's post on the forum?
2010-12-03T12:09:55  <antimatroid> what about allowing all bots to communicate with each other (so they all run in the same program) but they onlsee see x distance from any friend bot
2010-12-03T12:10:00  <Error323> janzert: that's a good idea
2010-12-03T12:10:03  <antimatroid> all friend bots*
2010-12-03T12:10:10  <Error323> ;]
2010-12-03T12:10:18  <janzert> meneky_: not sure, which one?
2010-12-03T12:10:36  <Mistmanov> antimatroid: that's also possible, but then you kinda lose the point of the entire game :p
2010-12-03T12:10:43  <janzert> antimatroid: that's basically RTS with fog of war right?
2010-12-03T12:10:44  <Mistmanov> that's more a classic rts
2010-12-03T12:11:10  <meneky_> janzert: this one http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1191, i have just take a superficial llok at it
2010-12-03T12:11:20  <antimatroid> how can you have turn based rts?
2010-12-03T12:11:26  <antimatroid> i don't think i understand the meaning of rts
2010-12-03T12:11:35  <janzert> ahh, no I hadn't
2010-12-03T12:12:19  <Mistmanov> for humans, the difference between rts and tbs is that in a tbs you have all the time in the world to think about your moves, while in rts you need to act quickly
2010-12-03T12:12:33  <Mistmanov> for programs, that difference falls away a bit imho
2010-12-03T12:12:43  <antimatroid> isn't real time strategy implying time is continuous?
2010-12-03T12:12:45  <antimatroid> not discrete
2010-12-03T12:13:04  <antimatroid> that's what i had always gathered
2010-12-03T12:13:09  <Mistmanov> yeah but for a computer the time is always going to be discrete
2010-12-03T12:13:16  <antimatroid> well no
2010-12-03T12:13:31  <antimatroid> you can have no "turns" and just let bots execute moves as they want
2010-12-03T12:13:39  <antimatroid> the max time for a game can be used
2010-12-03T12:13:57  <Migi32> that's an interesting thought
2010-12-03T12:14:05  <Mistmanov> well, the game engine would still only read input at specific timesteps right?
2010-12-03T12:14:07  <janzert> antimatroid: I think of the difference between RTS and TBS is rts time advances whether the player does anything or not
2010-12-03T12:14:23  <janzert> the RTS time is actually often discrete at the simulation level
2010-12-03T12:14:30  <a1k0n> not necessarily; all unit actions can be defined in terms of continuous time
2010-12-03T12:14:34  <Mistmanov> each timestep that a bot gives no commands is then just a turn in which the bot gave no commands
2010-12-03T12:14:43  *** sow <sow!51d917f0@gateway/web/freenode/ip.81.217.23.240> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2010-12-03T12:14:46  <a1k0n> but generally it's implemented with timesteps, yes
2010-12-03T12:15:56  <antimatroid> Mistmanov: sure i guess, but a lot of people don't really treat it like that
2010-12-03T12:16:09  <antimatroid> i think a contest where there was no concept of turns at all would be interesting
2010-12-03T12:16:26  <Migi32> but how do you let the bots keep track of the gamestate then? If you let them track it themselves there can be rounding errors in the floating point operations, and updating it after every command can become quite cpu-intensive
2010-12-03T12:16:34  <antimatroid> i think pursuier/evader games would work for that, although it really needs to have both as both
2010-12-03T12:16:58  <antimatroid> ^^ hadn't got tht far :P
2010-12-03T12:18:18  <Migi32> but yea a "real time" game would be really cool. You don't have artificial computing time limits then, either.
2010-12-03T12:19:49  <Mistmanov> I think computing time limits would become way more important in a real time game
2010-12-03T12:20:10  <Mistmanov> if your bot takes 100 ms to adapt to a new situation, and the enemy bot is doing something radically different every 10 ms
2010-12-03T12:21:13  <Migi32> true. There'll be a real trade-off between how much you want your bot to calculate before doing his first move.
2010-12-03T12:21:17  <Mistmanov> say.. if in planetwars you could redirect your ships midflight as ofen as you want
2010-12-03T12:21:27  <Mistmanov> faster bots have a real advantage there
2010-12-03T12:24:04  <Migi32> hmmm. You could also just make the other bot crash by sending too many orders, though.
2010-12-03T12:24:24  <Mistmanov> Yup.
2010-12-03T12:25:55  <Mistmanov> so you should at least impose a limit on the number of orders per turn
2010-12-03T12:26:00  <Mistmanov> eh per second
2010-12-03T12:27:13  <mega1> Migi32: I knew it would break someone's heart :-)
2010-12-03T12:28:06  <mega1> take comfort in the fact that those MIN-TURN constraint are crucial as well.
2010-12-03T12:28:55  <Migi32> mega1, no I designed it with the min-turn stuff in mind
2010-12-03T12:29:27  <mega1> well, in that case I can offer no consolation.
2010-12-03T12:30:02  <Migi32> aww :(
2010-12-03T12:30:25  <Migi32> but no worries, seeing how close I got to the best solution I won't hold back next time :P
2010-12-03T12:31:26  <antimatroid> nobody was close :P
2010-12-03T12:31:35  <antimatroid> getting the fine details perfect was very important too
2010-12-03T12:31:49  <mega1> Migi32: I still feel that the move generator was underemphasized.
2010-12-03T12:31:58  <antimatroid> i think the actual continous time idea is quite bad now
2010-12-03T12:32:13  <antimatroid> mega1: i still think it's all in the move selection :P
2010-12-03T12:32:32  <mega1> yes, that's what I mean
2010-12-03T12:35:16  <Migi32> antimatroid, well at one point I was fairly close, not in ELO but in general idea. But yea, when I realised that this kind of move evalution will prefer doing nothing so it still has many options left instead of being commited to one, I thought this was a fundamental flaw that couldn't be fixed.
2010-12-03T12:36:16  <mega1> that's where min-turn should help
2010-12-03T12:36:25  <mega1> most of the time
2010-12-03T12:36:44  <Migi32> also, I've read the code and (while I don't understand Lisp too much) the move generation was fairly similar as well
2010-12-03T12:37:43  <mega1> there were about a hundred little variants, tweak of the move generator
2010-12-03T12:37:59  <mega1> it was a very sensitive instrument
2010-12-03T12:38:01  <antimatroid> i think a lot of people did similar things though :P i know i did in places
2010-12-03T12:38:11  <antimatroid> it was the entire combination, and without a doubt he pantsed the lot of us
2010-12-03T12:38:28  <antimatroid> well, accoun will doubt
2010-12-03T12:38:30  <antimatroid> nobody else does
2010-12-03T12:38:33  <Migi32> lol
2010-12-03T12:38:39  <antimatroid> :)
2010-12-03T12:38:55  <mega1> One important lesson I learnt is how important it is to fix things in the right order.
2010-12-03T12:39:31  <antimatroid> i'm not sure what i leant with mine other than do better :P
2010-12-03T12:39:42  <Migi32> but yea, I'm not saying I would've gotten first place. But after reading this I think top 10 was definitely possible
2010-12-03T12:39:53  <a1k0n> heh i also did the full attack based eval function
2010-12-03T12:40:14  <antimatroid> Migi32: I'm not trying to be an ass, but so did 50 other people :P
2010-12-03T12:40:27  <antimatroid> i'm just an ass naturally
2010-12-03T12:40:36  <mega1> a1k0n: did you use it for the neutrals too?
2010-12-03T12:40:41  <a1k0n> yes.
2010-12-03T12:40:55  <a1k0n> well, i mainly used to determine how many ships i can afford to send out
2010-12-03T12:41:01  <a1k0n> but that was too conservative
2010-12-03T12:41:20  <mega1> ah, yes. full-attack based move generation sucked
2010-12-03T12:41:42  <antimatroid> that is what i originally did, but never worked out the issues with it
2010-12-03T12:41:42  <mega1> I used the normal future for that.
2010-12-03T12:41:42  <a1k0n> i didn't have the initial insight you did that if you can take one planet you can take them all
2010-12-03T12:41:54  *** narnach_mb <narnach_mb!~Narnach@5357672F.cm-6-8b.dynamic.ziggo.nl> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2010-12-03T12:42:10  <mega1> (or if you cannot take one then you can take none)
2010-12-03T12:42:18  <a1k0n> right
2010-12-03T12:42:41  <mega1> I haven't proved it though
2010-12-03T12:42:49  <mega1> may be wrong.
2010-12-03T12:43:37  <a1k0n> my move generator was basically to compute the future out to the horizon, and then work backward and determine how many ships are needed to take each planet from each side
2010-12-03T12:43:59  <antimatroid> mega1: you assumed that if one planet can't be taken then another can't?
2010-12-03T12:44:02  <a1k0n> then send out that many or more, as long as you don't weaken yourself by my other discounted-full-attack thing
2010-12-03T12:44:03  <mega1> a1k0n: from each side?
2010-12-03T12:44:13  <a1k0n> well, as two separate counts
2010-12-03T12:44:19  <antimatroid> that is wrong in general, but probably not too often
2010-12-03T12:44:31  <mega1> antimatroid: no, no. Read the full attack future section in the post-mortem.
2010-12-03T12:44:56  <mega1> a1k0n: what did you need counts of the opponent for?
2010-12-03T12:45:02  <a1k0n> so like, if player 2 had ships on the way to one of player 1's planets "i", planet[i].needed[1] would be the number of ships to fend off the attack
2010-12-03T12:45:08  <Migi32> mega1, talking about this bit? "if for all planets of player 1 player 2 cannot take that planet if both players sent all ships to it then player 2 cannot take any planet of player 1 even if he's allowed to attack multiple planets in any pattern"
2010-12-03T12:45:15  <a1k0n> mega1: for minimax move generation
2010-12-03T12:45:18  <mega1> Migi32: yes
2010-12-03T12:45:23  <Migi32> it's wrong
2010-12-03T12:45:31  <Migi32> I can give you a map with 4 planets to show you
2010-12-03T12:45:32  <mega1> I'd not be surprised
2010-12-03T12:45:32  <Migi32> holdo n
2010-12-03T12:45:34  <Migi32> on*
2010-12-03T12:46:07  <mega1> a1k0n: this is for simultaneous moves, right?
2010-12-03T12:46:11  <a1k0n> (actually i had planets[i].frames[j].needed[1] rather)
2010-12-03T12:46:23  <a1k0n> yes...?
2010-12-03T12:46:42  <a1k0n> i didn't actually need a lot of the stuff i calculated, but i had it on hand with no clear idea of how best to exploit it.
2010-12-03T12:47:07  <mega1> one idea that was too costly in terms of cpu time was to generate moves after observing good moves of the opponent
2010-12-03T12:47:11  <antimatroid> oh, how far into the future did you make moves per planet? i just did it to maxDistance
2010-12-03T12:47:27  <a1k0n> i did that initially
2010-12-03T12:47:35  <mega1> and?
2010-12-03T12:47:38  <a1k0n> but like, then it would make ridiculous assumptions about what the opponent would actually do
2010-12-03T12:48:03  <a1k0n> oh, observing
2010-12-03T12:48:17  <a1k0n> nevermind.  you mean actually modelling the opponent?
2010-12-03T12:48:25  <mega1> no, I think you answered what I had in mind.
2010-12-03T12:48:34  <a1k0n> oh.  yeah.  i generated moves greedily for the opponent, then for myself
2010-12-03T12:48:38  <a1k0n> then... i lost, and commented that out.
2010-12-03T12:49:06  <a1k0n> it would try to snipe attacks that never happened, etc.
2010-12-03T12:49:13  <a1k0n> might be useful when you have an advantage.  dunno.
2010-12-03T12:49:20  <mega1> ok, I actually wanted to generate moves for the top N opponent moves
2010-12-03T12:49:32  <a1k0n> yeah, that could work but how do you decide which to use?
2010-12-03T12:49:40  <mega1> which top N/
2010-12-03T12:49:41  <mega1> ?
2010-12-03T12:49:42  <a1k0n> i guess use the moves that come out consistently?
2010-12-03T12:49:52  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i solved the stupid snipes by not having either bot consider sending a snipable expansionary move
2010-12-03T12:50:01  <mega1> the evaluation would stay the same
2010-12-03T12:50:03  <a1k0n> which moves you make, given the best moves for you given the best top N opponent moves
2010-12-03T12:51:02  <mega1> the best ones according to my normal evaluation function?
2010-12-03T12:51:07  <a1k0n> antimatroid: yeah that would probably help.
2010-12-03T12:51:59  <a1k0n> mega1: i guess what i'm saying is, if you assume in turn the enemy does N different things, and for each of those, pick a set of moves... how do you finally pick among the moves?  your evaulation scores are each dependent on the opponent action
2010-12-03T12:52:16  <antimatroid> also, sending ships at the very last possible turn meant that i could respond to their "potential moves" and not stupidly send stuff of for moves they made unless it was needed to cancel it
2010-12-03T12:52:18  <a1k0n> so you'd get a score boost if you assume the opponent does something stupid, no?
2010-12-03T12:52:50  <a1k0n> yeah i should have worked on move scheduling more.  i kept implementing it badly.
2010-12-03T12:53:08  <antimatroid> because of my move scheduling i had redirection too
2010-12-03T12:53:27  <mega1> a1k0n: this would be move generation only. It would be evaluated by the full attack based eval so I think picking a sensible one is easy.
2010-12-03T12:53:29  <antimatroid> so if i had a scheduled fleet and could sent it closer to the enemy while making the first intended trip in time, i would
2010-12-03T12:54:00  <a1k0n> mega1: ah, i see.  so you don't actually assume the opponent makes the move, you just find responses to potential moves and then evaluate them.
2010-12-03T12:54:01  <mega1> in other words, I would not use the opponent moves when evaluating
2010-12-03T12:54:07  <a1k0n> gotcha
2010-12-03T12:54:07  <mega1> yes
2010-12-03T12:54:19  <mega1> but that's still costly
2010-12-03T12:54:28  <mega1> maybe not prohibitive though
2010-12-03T12:54:56  <a1k0n> i gotta get to work, bbl
2010-12-03T12:55:07  <mega1> me too
2010-12-03T13:07:16  <Error323> mega1: how old are you if i may ask?
2010-12-03T13:07:22  <mega1> 36
2010-12-03T13:07:38  <Error323> ah ok :) did you study AI ?
2010-12-03T13:07:45  <amstan_> oh yay, more activity
2010-12-03T13:07:52  <amstan_> i was affraid it would die again
2010-12-03T13:07:55  <mega1> but I do look much younger :-)
2010-12-03T13:08:00  <Naktibalda> :)
2010-12-03T13:08:00  <Error323> haha =)
2010-12-03T13:08:01  <amstan_> what's the topic?
2010-12-03T13:08:06  <mega1> my age?
2010-12-03T13:08:06  <Naktibalda> like 35?
2010-12-03T13:08:09  *** amstan_ is now known as amstan
2010-12-03T13:08:17  <amstan> mega1: you're like 27
2010-12-03T13:08:22  <amstan> mega1: am i right?
2010-12-03T13:08:26  <amstan> oh.. wait
2010-12-03T13:08:28  <amstan> 36
2010-12-03T13:09:00  <mega1> Error323: what they taught us at uni was very old school
2010-12-03T13:09:15  <Error323> he looks like 27 =)
2010-12-03T13:09:24  <Error323> mega1: ah ok, but it was AI?
2010-12-03T13:09:28  <mega1> it felt even less AI then machine learning does now
2010-12-03T13:09:35  <mega1> Error323: they called it AI
2010-12-03T13:09:50  <Error323> wlel the field hasn't changed that much?
2010-12-03T13:09:52  * Naktibalda doesn't remember what he was taught at uni, it was a crap anyway :)
2010-12-03T13:10:19  <mega1> I think probability theory is starting to dominate and that's good.
2010-12-03T13:10:20  * Naktibalda spent his time in computer class playing quakeworld and counterstrike
2010-12-03T13:11:16  <mega1> it makes a lot more sense then "frames" and hackish expert systems
2010-12-03T13:11:31  <Error323> mega1: I agree completely
2010-12-03T13:11:37  <Naktibalda> what are frames?
2010-12-03T13:11:41  <Error323> I actually found uni very very usefull
2010-12-03T13:11:54  <mega1> Naktibalda: boxes with rounded corners :-)
2010-12-03T13:12:06  <Naktibalda> like UML?
2010-12-03T13:12:13  <mega1> supposed to hold other frames and somehow be a good representation of knowledge.
2010-12-03T13:12:46  <mega1> Naktibalda: yes, and they make me feel the same
2010-12-03T13:13:07  <mega1> "Is there anything to this except for nice pictures?"
2010-12-03T13:13:24  <mega1> it certainly didn't look like something that would scale.
2010-12-03T13:13:38  <a1k0n> probability theory is fun.
2010-12-03T13:13:57  <mega1> already at work?
2010-12-03T13:14:00  <mega1> yes, it is
2010-12-03T13:14:01  <Error323> i was felt those expert systems were dirty hacks
2010-12-03T13:14:09  <a1k0n> i live 2 miles away
2010-12-03T13:14:31  <a1k0n> i kinda even loathe SVMs that are so in vogue just for their geometric instead of probabilistic motivation
2010-12-03T13:14:41  <mega1> same here
2010-12-03T13:14:43  <a1k0n> i have to reframe things in terms of loss functions to talk to my coworkers
2010-12-03T13:15:28  <mega1> black sheep
2010-12-03T13:16:26  <mega1> there is a good critique by Hinton sayings that SVM are just flat template matchers
2010-12-03T13:17:06  <mega1> and he's of course a big believer in deep architectures
2010-12-03T13:17:26  <mega1> (as in several connected layers ... of neurons for example)
2010-12-03T13:17:49  <Error323> hey guys something related
2010-12-03T13:18:07  <Error323> how do you feel about these prediction of the singularity of ai being achieved in the year 2050
2010-12-03T13:18:13  <Error323> been reading that a lot lately
2010-12-03T13:18:18  <Error323> even in the scientific american
2010-12-03T13:18:40  <mega1> I can't reliably judge media phenomenoms ;-)
2010-12-03T13:19:17  <Error323> No I mean, its never a true researcher in the field making these claims :P
2010-12-03T13:19:29  <Error323> And with good reason, imo its bullshit
2010-12-03T13:19:38  <mega1> extrapolation is hard. The only one I know who's capable of it is Hari Seldon.
2010-12-03T13:19:50  <Error323> there needs to be something atleast as revolutionary as the computer itself for this to happen
2010-12-03T13:20:04  <Error323> stuff like reinforcement learning doesn't scale well at all
2010-12-03T13:20:28  <amstan> Error323: what do you mean by reinforcement?
2010-12-03T13:20:40  <Error323> learning through reward/punishment
2010-12-03T13:20:41  <Meatkat> Make a couple of additions to the kill ant robot idea... you should take a look and let me know what you think - http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1205
2010-12-03T13:20:45  <Error323> its a field of AI
2010-12-03T13:21:47  <Error323> a field of machinelearning actually, the unsupervised kind
2010-12-03T13:22:28  <mega1> Perhaps reinforcement learning is fine as a top-level mechanism.

2010-12-03T13:34:42  <Error323> well I don't know, but its just impossible to predict
2010-12-03T13:34:51  <antimatroid> i've never come across anything thorugh the ai fild anything reselmbing that kind of thing
2010-12-03T13:35:00  <Error323> yet somehow the magical year 2050 solves all our problems :P

2010-12-03T13:35:35  <antimatroid> all ai stuff is more just how to make good approximations
2010-12-03T13:35:41  <antimatroid> at least as far as i've looked
2010-12-03T13:36:14  <antimatroid> (which isn't very far)
2010-12-03T13:39:03  <a1k0n> it's the new year 2000
2010-12-03T13:39:19  <Error323> indd
2010-12-03T13:39:32  <a1k0n> numenta recently released their cortical algorithm whitepaper, which is worth looking at
2010-12-03T13:39:49  <Error323> cortical?
2010-12-03T13:39:58  <a1k0n> they don't have any kind of demo showing that it works at all
2010-12-03T13:40:07  <a1k0n> yeah, it's based on how the neocortex is supposed to work
2010-12-03T13:40:21  <a1k0n> http://www.numenta.com/htm-overview/htm-algorithms.php
2010-12-03T13:40:39  <a1k0n> anyway, hinton's deep RBM is the most impressive demo i've ever seen of a neural network
2010-12-03T13:40:55  <a1k0n> so i think there is some promise in that area
2010-12-03T13:41:07  <mega1> yeah, I invested a lot of time there
2010-12-03T13:41:22  <a1k0n> i also wrote my own rbm but haven't toyed with it all that much
2010-12-03T13:41:33  <Error323> rbm being?
2010-12-03T13:41:42  <mega1> restricted boltzmann machine
2010-12-03T13:41:46  <a1k0n> i want to make a convolutional RBM like yann lecun's stuff
2010-12-03T13:42:05  <mega1> that I have not implemented
2010-12-03T13:43:03  <a1k0n> in the meantime, logistic regression on giant amounts of data works pretty well.
2010-12-03T13:43:16  <a1k0n> (for.. non-vision problems that i am faced with)
2010-12-03T13:43:35  <mega1> structure vs noise
2010-12-03T13:43:49  <mega1> picture have lot of structure
2010-12-03T13:44:01  <a1k0n> yeah, the key is getting a sparse representation somehow
2010-12-03T13:44:01  <mega1> web data has little structure and lots of noise
2010-12-03T13:44:42  <a1k0n> i wonder how hard it'd be to come up with a generative model of email
2010-12-03T13:44:52  <mega1> very?
2010-12-03T13:45:30  <mega1> email isn't easier then any other text, is it?
2010-12-03T13:45:43  <a1k0n> i guess it's equivalent to the turing test at some point
2010-12-03T13:45:57  <a1k0n> but i mainly want "email that looks like real messages" vs. "email that looks like spam"
2010-12-03T13:45:57  <mega1> are you dealing with text mostly?
2010-12-03T13:46:08  <a1k0n> text and abstract featurs of senders and recipients
2010-12-03T13:46:51  <mega1> (there are temporal boltzman machine variants too)
2010-12-03T13:47:05  <mega1> (and those should be a better fit for text).
2010-12-03T13:47:32  <a1k0n> does your company actually commit money to the stock market based on its news sentiment analysis?
2010-12-03T13:47:44  <mega1> I don't work there anymore.

2010-12-03T13:54:51  <a1k0n> you think a TRBM could model text generatively?
2010-12-03T13:55:19  <mega1> better than a non-T variant :-)
2010-12-03T13:55:38  <mega1> I don't think we are at the point where anything can do a good job of it.
2010-12-03T13:56:03  <a1k0n> yeah.  bag-of-bigrams is usually good enough
2010-12-03T13:57:00  <mega1> I used svm/rbm/dbn for text classification with n-grams and had slightly better results for the boltzman ones

2010-12-03T13:57:20  <a1k0n> interesting
2010-12-03T13:57:32  <a1k0n> but rbm is a pain to train in comparison
2010-12-03T13:57:36  <mega1> but that might have been because I liked them more and spent more time on them
2010-12-03T13:57:42  <mega1> oh, yes
2010-12-03T13:57:43  <a1k0n> hehe
2010-12-03T13:58:15  <mega1> some SVMs are a pain to train too with much data
2010-12-03T13:58:23  <a1k0n> for sentiment analysis... did you not use LDA?

2010-12-03T14:02:17  <mega1> between very negative and very positive
2010-12-03T14:02:21  <a1k0n> ah
2010-12-03T14:02:32  <mega1> depends on what you want to do with it
2010-12-03T14:04:17  <a1k0n> i dunno if you've seen http://kaggle.com/ but there's a huge variety of machine learning programming contests there
2010-12-03T14:05:05  <a1k0n> oh dang, a $25k one ends tomorrow
2010-12-03T14:05:10  <mega1> (speaking of matrix factorization, I recommend 'A Bayesian matrix Factorization Model for
2010-12-03T14:05:10  <mega1> Relational Data')
2010-12-03T14:05:30  <mega1> I know kaggle, but don't want to.
2010-12-03T14:05:43  <a1k0n> i heart matrix factorization.  is that what you did in the netflix prize challenge?
2010-12-03T14:05:57  <a1k0n> i came up with it by myself and was all proud of it until i learned everyone else did too
2010-12-03T14:07:06  <mega1> cool. I don't think I did too many original things there.
2010-12-03T14:07:19  <mega1> but got the boltzmann bug.
2010-12-03T14:07:51  <mega1> I wanted to get some kind of ant system working.
2010-12-03T14:08:05  <mega1> without any success whatsoever.

2010-12-03T14:11:07  <a1k0n> i'm working my way through 'on intelligence' by jeff hawkins
2010-12-03T14:11:30  <mega1> is it good?
2010-12-03T14:11:32  <a1k0n> as i said there's no public proof that his cortex ideas actually work but the rbm stuff is similar enough to what he describes and does seem to work
2010-12-03T14:11:37  <a1k0n> it's very interesting.  yeah, recommended.

2010-12-03T14:13:06  <Error323> I have never heard of a boltzmann machine o_O
2010-12-03T14:13:22  <Error323> yet it seems quite significant for an AI student lol

2010-12-03T14:13:59  <Error323> a1k0n: thanks
2010-12-03T14:14:07  <Error323> is this very new?
2010-12-03T14:14:13  <a1k0n> a couple years old now
2010-12-03T14:14:22  <mega1> Error323: I also have a couple of blog entries on them.
2010-12-03T14:14:35  <mega1> ... although focusing on my library.
2010-12-03T14:14:43  <a1k0n> i mean, boltzmann machines have been around for a long time but hinton's learning algorithm seems to be a sort of breakthrough
2010-12-03T14:14:47  <a1k0n> (recent breakthrough)
2010-12-03T14:14:57  <Error323> cool
2010-12-03T14:15:01  <Error323> ill delve into it
2010-12-03T14:15:34  <mega1> a1k0n: are aware of this: http://www.kyb.mpg.de/bs/people/weston/papers/unified_nlp.pdf ?
2010-12-03T14:15:46  <mega1> "A Unified Architecture for Natural Language Processing: Deep Neural Networks with Multitask Learning"
2010-12-03T14:15:53  <mega1> *are you
2010-12-03T14:16:05  <a1k0n> i don't think i had seen that, no.  thanks.
2010-12-03T14:16:10  <mega1> it's great
2010-12-03T14:16:34  <mega1> there are signs that rbm are not the only deep learners that work and this is one
2010-12-03T14:17:17  <a1k0n> nice.  yeah, lecun has a couple non-rbm deep networks, usually alternating convolutional/non-convolutional layers
2010-12-03T14:17:49  <mega1> yes, that's his thing
2010-12-03T14:18:13  <mega1> now is there something like convolution for non-vision tasks?
2010-12-03T14:18:30  <a1k0n> the paper you just linked me uses convolutional weight sharing
2010-12-03T14:18:44  <mega1> heh, I forgot
2010-12-03T14:19:27  <mega1> you will find the coveted distributed representation there as well if I'm not mistaken

2010-12-03T17:50:53  <sigh> Zannick: did you know that Lisp is the greatest language for AI, and all other languages don't even come close?
2010-12-03T17:50:55  <Zannick> The fact that the rankings are a wild mess of languages pretty much indicates that you can't say one language is strictly better than another
2010-12-03T17:51:51  <sigh> yup
2010-12-03T17:54:02  <Zannick> saying that lisp is the best language for ai is saying that lisp was the language of the winning entry in the ai challenge this time around, and that the ai contest is such a good litmus test of real ai that the language of the top entry must be the best language for ai
2010-12-03T17:54:15  <Zannick> and only one of those assertions holds

2010-12-03T18:54:09  <sigh> yeah
2010-12-03T18:54:15  <bhasker> i looked at the codecup competition
2010-12-03T18:54:20  <sigh> but the most important thing will be move selection
2010-12-03T18:54:21  <bhasker> but dvonn doesn't seem interesting
2010-12-03T18:54:31  <bhasker> i think i have a decent move generator
2010-12-03T18:54:35  <bhasker> and an evaluation function
2010-12-03T18:54:52  <bhasker> so it should be good enough to start off
2010-12-03T18:55:31  <sigh> :)
2010-12-03T18:56:16  <sigh> be sure to test it against other bots though, running minimax against yourself is not going to be a god indicator of how well it does :P
2010-12-03T18:56:21  <sigh> given the massive pruning
2010-12-03T18:56:41  <sigh> but there are plenty of bots available so, that should not be a problem
2010-12-03T18:57:28  <bhasker> yea and my heuristic bot should do fine
2010-12-03T18:57:37  <bhasker> since it ended up 54 so it won't be a bad test bed
2010-12-03T18:58:06  <bhasker> i think initially i am just going to generate one set of moves per planet
2010-12-03T18:58:15  <sigh> no, my point was that it will be a bad test bed if you are using the same heuristics for move generation in minimax
2010-12-03T18:59:18  <bhasker> ah k
2010-12-03T18:59:40  <bhasker> did you read about codecup
2010-12-03T18:59:50  <bhasker> they have much stricter time requirements for the game
2010-12-03T18:59:55  <bhasker> 5 seconds for the whole game ^
2010-12-03T18:59:59  <sigh> I glanced at it when antimatroid posted about it
2010-12-03T19:00:09  <bhasker> though watching the game didnt look very interesting
2010-12-03T19:00:17  <sigh> didn't strike me as an interesting game
2010-12-03T19:00:18  <sigh> yeah
2010-12-03T19:01:19  <bhasker> oh they do have an applet visualizer
2010-12-03T19:04:00  <Error323> yoooooooooooooooooooooo
2010-12-03T19:04:10  <sigh> o_O
2010-12-03T19:04:17  <Error323> :P
2010-12-03T19:04:19  <Error323> hi

2010-12-03T19:04:29  <sigh> :P
2010-12-03T19:05:01  <Error323> ^_^

2010-12-03T19:56:03  <bhasker_> hehe its kinda sad to see the rankings frozen
2010-12-03T19:56:09  <bhasker_> though its good to have a life back
2010-12-03T19:56:13  <burny> :)
2010-12-03T19:57:07  <dmj111> he, that is for sure.  except it feels a little weird still.
