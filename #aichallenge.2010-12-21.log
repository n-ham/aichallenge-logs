2010-12-21T01:08:56  <Frontier> antimatroid1: Generate me some epic game of 400 turns please :)
2010-12-21T01:09:42  * Frontier remembers his sister beeing annoyed by the new habit to call everything epic.
2010-12-21T01:14:06  <Zannick> sweet
2010-12-21T01:16:08  <Frontier> oh hi zannick, i read your forum post and silently agree
2010-12-21T01:24:02  <Zannick> cool
2010-12-21T01:42:18  <Frontier> antimatroid1: Never mind, I loaded your old package of executables and run it on wine.
2010-12-21T01:43:46  <Frontier> I really wonder how the game ends after 400 turns. Will all grains be harvested? Does one ant lose by another ant stepping on it's base square?

2010-12-21T02:22:38  <antimatroid1> Frontier: you ran a game for that long?
2010-12-21T02:22:45  <antimatroid1> i have horrible memory issues with it on mine
2010-12-21T02:23:37  <Frontier> no it crashed on turn 172
2010-12-21T02:24:16  <Frontier> I recompiled it with the sources from the smaller (280 KB) package under linux and now it runs for a little longer (antbot vs atartbot)
2010-12-21T02:25:07  <Frontier> do i have to clear the gui file after each game?
2010-12-21T02:25:18  <antimatroid1> Frontier: i'll have another go at cleaning up issues before
2010-12-21T02:25:24  <antimatroid1> don't have to clear the gui file each time
2010-12-21T02:25:31  <antimatroid1> you do have to clear the map file if you want to make a new one
2010-12-21T02:25:51  <Frontier> well i had 600+ gos in 171 turns
2010-12-21T02:26:20  <antimatroid1> hmmm, that's not right
2010-12-21T02:26:43  <Frontier> lol, turn 284 and there is only on ant of A left hinding in a corner
2010-12-21T02:27:37  <antimatroid1> that ai is really really retarded too though
2010-12-21T02:27:51  <Frontier> wtf? player 2 wins? the little 'a' is still on the map!
2010-12-21T02:28:42  <antimatroid1> did it reach maxturns?
2010-12-21T02:29:11  <antimatroid1> if you reach the max specified number of turns, the winner is the player with the most ants
2010-12-21T02:29:18  <Frontier> probably a B ant moving into A's home base
2010-12-21T02:30:08  <antimatroid1> depending on the file you have, i have made changes
2010-12-21T02:32:18  <Frontier> lol take a look at the visualizer -_-
2010-12-21T02:33:40  <Frontier> ok the gui file might have been corrupted due to the crash on the first run or something. it definitly gest cleared now
2010-12-21T02:34:21  <antimatroid1> did it return fin or just crash?
2010-12-21T02:34:31  <antimatroid1> oh sorry, i was scrolled up :P
2010-12-21T02:35:25  <antimatroid1> larger map?
2010-12-21T02:35:33  <antimatroid1> or lack of player 1 doing anything
2010-12-21T02:36:03  <antimatroid1> some people didn't like the fusion? what are your thoughts on it?
2010-12-21T02:36:08  <antimatroid1> i think it's cool strategy wise
2010-12-21T02:38:19  <Frontier> I don't like it either. It is an instagib where you usually have to fight for 5 rounds
2010-12-21T02:38:45  *** Palmik <Palmik!~Palmik@palmikpc.sks6.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-21T02:39:13  <antimatroid1> bah, i think i'm alone on liking fusion then
2010-12-21T02:40:53  <Frontier> Bots use each 60 MB and engine 130 MB in turn 80
2010-12-21T02:41:10  <antimatroid1> yeah, there's a memory issue, they shouldn't use anything like that
2010-12-21T02:41:17  <antimatroid1> i don't think the actual bots are using that much
2010-12-21T02:41:40  <Frontier> I thought it was all the 32-bit textures in 2048x2048 and the high detail models with specular mapping?
2010-12-21T02:42:01  <Frontier> oh wait.. it is text based :p
2010-12-21T02:42:09  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-21T02:42:29  <antimatroid1> there is something leaking memory
2010-12-21T02:43:35  <Frontier> what about the cpu use of the engine?
2010-12-21T02:43:51  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure, it gets really really slow
2010-12-21T02:43:51  <Frontier> it is fairly high, too. do you know why?
2010-12-21T02:43:56  <antimatroid1> but i don't know if that's linked to the error or not
2010-12-21T02:44:11  <antimatroid1> i don't think it should get that much worse with more ants
2010-12-21T02:44:33  <antimatroid1> there are a couple of times i loop through the entire grid to find all ants each turn, but i don't do it for every ant i don't think
2010-12-21T02:47:18  <Frontier> I could run valgrind on the bot now, but i guess - as you don't use pointers, that C++ cleans it all up on exit
2010-12-21T02:48:15  <antimatroid1> i have no idea how valgrind works or how to use it :P
2010-12-21T02:48:35  <antimatroid1> i have a feeling it
2010-12-21T02:48:42  <antimatroid1> 's to do with input output somehow
2010-12-21T02:48:53  <antimatroid1> like lots of
2010-12-21T02:49:01  <antimatroid1> '\n' 's or something
2010-12-21T02:49:07  <antimatroid1> i wish ' wasn't next to enter
2010-12-21T02:49:59  <rabidus> have you been thinking of 32*64 (n * n*2 ) sized map, and both bases are at n/2, n/2 and n/2+n, n/2
2010-12-21T02:50:09  <rabidus> it would be much easier to watch
2010-12-21T02:50:11  <Frontier> valgrind sneaks in between your code and the c++ memory manager from the runtime and logs every allocation and deallocation. When your application quits it can tell you if you have leaked memory somewhere. Such systems exist for other languages as well, like FastMM4 for Delphi.
2010-12-21T02:51:25  <Frontier> radibus: bases are where they are, to make sure your bot doesn't know the location of the enemy from the start
2010-12-21T02:51:36  <rabidus> ah.. ok.
2010-12-21T02:51:38  <Frontier> I could try and move the bases to the center in the visualizer though
2010-12-21T02:51:40  <rabidus> in that case
2010-12-21T02:51:58  *** jaspervdj <jaspervdj!~jaspervdj@zeus.ugent.be> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-21T02:52:21  <Frontier> omg a is about to win: +58 grains
2010-12-21T02:52:35  <Frontier> b is already empty
2010-12-21T02:52:54  <Frontier> omg a is starting an offense
2010-12-21T02:53:02  <Frontier> turn 218 and going
2010-12-21T02:53:21  <Frontier> b tries to defend, but has some ants dedlocked in a corner
2010-12-21T02:53:43  <Frontier> for every ant of b there are two ants of a attacking now
2010-12-21T02:54:07  <Frontier> b is organizing for a base defense now
2010-12-21T02:54:29  <Frontier> it collected 5 grains, but will that be enough?
2010-12-21T02:55:13  <Frontier> but what is a doing now? it stopped to attack! this is the chance for b to recover.
2010-12-21T02:56:33  <Frontier> they better win this game either way or my 3.5 GB RAM will be full before turn 400
2010-12-21T02:57:41  <antimatroid1> Frontier: you can play the partial games i think
2010-12-21T02:57:54  <antimatroid1> just delete to the last go and put fin at the end
2010-12-21T02:57:58  <antimatroid1> i did that once and it worked
2010-12-21T02:58:11  <antimatroid1> well, fin 0
2010-12-21T02:59:00  <Frontier> ok good to know
2010-12-21T03:00:26  <Frontier> what is this? b left it's base undefended and three ants of a come swarming in
2010-12-21T03:00:40  <Frontier> is this a victory?
2010-12-21T03:00:55  <Frontier> a is coming closer ... and closer... and WINS!
2010-12-21T03:01:02  <antimatroid1> game? :P
2010-12-21T03:01:21  <antimatroid1> i haven't got the bots trying to do anything past working out what square to move in that's adjacent to them
2010-12-21T03:01:24  <antimatroid1> hence why its so stupid
2010-12-21T03:01:47  <antimatroid1> if you want to make it better, paint outwards from each square until you find something attractive, then move to that first square
2010-12-21T03:02:37  <antimatroid1> that might be a square not yet visited, an enemy, grains, their base, etc.
2010-12-21T03:03:51  <Frontier> the game is uploaded under the name "long match"
2010-12-21T03:05:30  <Frontier> lol, look at the big heap of grains in the top row :p
2010-12-21T03:05:46  <antimatroid1> cool game
2010-12-21T03:06:39  <antimatroid1> i really like the ants game
2010-12-21T03:06:45  <antimatroid1> i think it would make a really good ai comp one
2010-12-21T03:07:24  <antimatroid1> it's easy to understand, easy to get started, yet provides lots of flexibility for different strategy variations near the top of hte leaderboard
2010-12-21T03:08:35  <Frontier> Yeah, it could really be a game with strategic and also fun moments, when one ant loses 30 grains because it moved to close to the enemy
2010-12-21T03:09:07  <antimatroid1> Frontier: what are your opinions on what happens to ant harvest when an ant dies?
2010-12-21T03:09:16  <antimatroid1> like say two opponents land on top of each other
2010-12-21T03:09:30  <antimatroid1> should the winning ant get all harvest, or the losing ant drops theirs and the ant has to reharvest it all
2010-12-21T03:09:52  <antimatroid1> i've changed my engine to do the later for the moment
2010-12-21T03:10:28  <Frontier> I think it is ok to have it drop the harvest
2010-12-21T03:10:39  <rabidus> what does that bot see? nothing?
2010-12-21T03:10:44  <rabidus> i mean ant
2010-12-21T03:11:03  <antimatroid1> an ant can see anything reachable within 6 mvoes, including through walls
2010-12-21T03:11:09  <antimatroid1> all friend ants share information
2010-12-21T03:11:11  <Frontier> I like when two ants 'dance' around each other on a 2x2 block
2010-12-21T03:11:25  <rabidus> so if they are 6 blocks away from enemy base, they can see it?
2010-12-21T03:11:29  <antimatroid1> Frontier: wait for the dancing when people implement strategies
2010-12-21T03:11:39  <antimatroid1> i expect ant combat to be the most interesting part
2010-12-21T03:11:49  <antimatroid1> and watching people kamakazee towards enemies bases
2010-12-21T03:11:53  <Frontier> this game is just epic man. :D
2010-12-21T03:12:04  <rabidus> ^idd
2010-12-21T03:12:20  <antimatroid1> rage bot is easy, once you see the enemy base, all ants walk towards it
2010-12-21T03:12:37  <antimatroid1> in the mean time, move to new squares or harvest and return home
2010-12-21T03:12:43  <Frontier> let someone create a crowbot and an antbot ^^
2010-12-21T03:13:03  <antimatroid1> snakebot needs to be done
2010-12-21T03:13:05  <rabidus> do you have a "starter class"
2010-12-21T03:13:11  <rabidus> lol snakebot :D
2010-12-21T03:13:22  <rabidus> antpath
2010-12-21T03:13:51  <antimatroid1> rabidus: i have a starter bot, but it's pretty stupid
2010-12-21T03:14:50  <Frontier> radibus: in case you haven't followed the discussion, here is the last game - http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3
2010-12-21T03:14:54  <antimatroid1> i'm looking at the engine atm
2010-12-21T03:15:06  <rabidus> yeah. that looks awesome
2010-12-21T03:15:13  <rabidus> refreshing every game right now :)
2010-12-21T03:16:28  <antimatroid1> Frontier: one option is to not allow friend ants to move onto the same square, so no fusion, but then if you receive more than one move there, which ant gets to make the move?
2010-12-21T03:16:48  <antimatroid1> i think it's good that enemy ants colliding fight to death
2010-12-21T03:17:27  <antimatroid1> it means you can charge their defense lines towards their base, rather than having to take out each ant in your path over 5 turns
2010-12-21T03:17:36  <Frontier> antimatroid1: I won't argue that, I'm just animating it :)
2010-12-21T03:18:59  <Frontier> ants would do it like this: They send an ant for each enemy in the way to lock them down and then send some more to walk over the fighting ants to the enemy base
2010-12-21T03:19:02  <antimatroid1> Frontier: it might be nice to have a button to skip back to the start
2010-12-21T03:19:09  <antimatroid1> so i don't reload every time i rewatch a game
2010-12-21T03:19:51  <Frontier> ok, I'll add that functionality to the play button once the end is reached.
2010-12-21T03:20:07  <antimatroid1> yep :)
2010-12-21T03:20:50  <Frontier> what do you guess is the filesize atm?
2010-12-21T03:21:01  <antimatroid1> for a game?
2010-12-21T03:21:08  <Frontier> for that long game
2010-12-21T03:21:22  <antimatroid1> too much? mb?
2010-12-21T03:21:33  <Frontier> no, less than 1 mb
2010-12-21T03:21:39  <Frontier> 257K :)
2010-12-21T03:21:45  <antimatroid1> that's not too bad is it?
2010-12-21T03:21:51  <antimatroid1> i think it's sending more than perhaps necessary atm too
2010-12-21T03:22:02  <Frontier> That's less than I expected after all :)
2010-12-21T03:22:45  <Frontier> you could save 30 K by omitting the tailing space
2010-12-21T03:25:20  <antimatroid1> i will get rid of that
2010-12-21T03:25:28  <antimatroid1> i had been meaning too and started to somewhere
2010-12-21T03:27:21  <antimatroid1> lol, i had the following functions defined in this order
2010-12-21T03:27:36  <antimatroid1> wait, nevermind
2010-12-21T03:27:46  <antimatroid1> i thought one was ostream and the other ofstream, but one was stringstream
2010-12-21T03:30:04  <Frontier> Once you are done with your changes and have a new replay you should be able to upload it via FTP for it to become the new 'default' replay.
2010-12-21T03:31:02  <antimatroid1> i'll see
2010-12-21T03:32:47  <antimatroid1> do i need an ftp client?
2010-12-21T03:33:15  <antimatroid1> ftp servers i have played around with before
2010-12-21T03:33:18  <antimatroid1> but it's been a few years
2010-12-21T03:33:24  <antimatroid1> and it was mostly for downloading :P
2010-12-21T03:34:05  <antimatroid1> never had proper scene access though :(
2010-12-21T03:35:04  <Frontier> hehe, you can use explorer.exe ftp://...
2010-12-21T03:35:44  <Frontier> I hope noone abuses this system, as the password is in the link ^^
2010-12-21T03:37:25  <antimatroid1> didn't seem to like me copying it there, but it also only finds ant.zip there
2010-12-21T03:39:51  <Frontier> use the username and password: antvis

2010-12-21T03:52:37  <Frontier> I need to reduce the ant trail visibility though. With matches that long they are too much.
2010-12-21T03:54:18  <antimatroid1> yes they are
2010-12-21T03:54:26  <antimatroid1> feel free to write one, use my one to start from
2010-12-21T03:54:42  <antimatroid1> i am slowly trolling through the engine again
2010-12-21T03:54:54  <antimatroid1> any chance you want to pass it thorugh valgrind anyway? :P
2010-12-21T03:55:24  <antimatroid1> (only if it doesn't take too long)
2010-12-21T04:03:12  <antimatroid1> each process has 2 pointers actually, but i only ever make 3 prcess objects and they remain the same the entire game
2010-12-21T04:03:20  <Frontier> oh right, i'll use one turn as the limit
2010-12-21T04:04:09  <antimatroid1> i think i've stipped all the extra ' 's
2010-12-21T04:06:36  <antimatroid1> lol, i know how to make the map gen faster
2010-12-21T04:07:16  <antimatroid1> make a list of usable squares, and keep removing invalid/used ones when adding walls
2010-12-21T04:07:19  <antimatroid1> but not important atm
2010-12-21T04:07:30  <Frontier> valgrind, says it is all ok. there is no memory leak other than 6 mallocs from opened file pointers that aren't closed
2010-12-21T04:07:59  <antimatroid1> hmm, maybe i should at least free the processes at the end :P
2010-12-21T04:08:05  <antimatroid1> i'll do that, but otherwise gah
2010-12-21T04:08:23  <Frontier> antimatroid1: I know, I thought about that optimization, when I tried to generate tiny maps and the map generator ended in an endless loop :p
2010-12-21T04:08:45  <antimatroid1> Frontier: yep, gotta be careful with how many walls you ask for and size

2010-12-21T04:18:49  <Frontier> Is it correct behaviour that your stringstream allocates 4 MB of memory in 8 turns?
2010-12-21T04:19:22  <Frontier> It's in Square.cc, line 14
2010-12-21T04:22:08  <Frontier> Did you know that the clear method clears the io-flags?
2010-12-21T04:22:41  <antimatroid1> i have no idea what the clear does :P
2010-12-21T04:23:03  <antimatroid1> what's your line 14 for square.cc?
2010-12-21T04:23:43  <antimatroid1> maybe i should use an i and o stringstream
2010-12-21T04:23:58  <antimatroid1> wait, no, i need to put stuff into it and then out
2010-12-21T04:24:46  <Frontier> use io.str("") to reset the accumulated string
2010-12-21T04:24:58  <Frontier> right befor you call io.clear() for example
2010-12-21T04:25:14  <Frontier> (can't harm to reset the error flags as well :p )
2010-12-21T04:26:12  <Frontier> It is still burning a lot of cpu time though
2010-12-21T04:27:03  <Frontier> Do you have some busy loops in there waiting for IO?
2010-12-21T04:27:57  <antimatroid1> it seems to have fixed the memory issue
2010-12-21T04:28:04  <antimatroid1> maybe engine really is just slow
2010-12-21T04:28:08  <antimatroid1> i'll clean this up then tackle that
2010-12-21T04:28:34  <antimatroid1> need to fix the bot too
2010-12-21T04:30:06  <antimatroid1> :D thanks though

2010-12-21T04:30:56  <antimatroid1> bots aren't leaking memory now either
2010-12-21T04:33:40  <antimatroid1> Frontier: it would all be a lot nicer if i could create a string stream inside each process, but it seems to hate me doing that, any idea why?
2010-12-21T04:34:05  <antimatroid1> then i can just template it to print any object like normal ostreams

2010-12-21T04:41:10  <antimatroid1> Frontier: a game went a lot faster when the bot doesn't call gameStream.clear() in passGameState
2010-12-21T04:41:41  <antimatroid1> wait, that's cause it screws up
2010-12-21T04:41:55  <Frontier> lol
2010-12-21T04:43:00  <antimatroid1> so all the extra memory is coming from those string streams somehow
2010-12-21T04:43:14  <antimatroid1> that's a lot of memory for a few "\n"s?
2010-12-21T04:43:39  <Frontier> antimatroid1: I don't know why it doesn't let you create string stream inside processes and I don't understand your code enough to know what you mean.
2010-12-21T04:43:51  <antimatroid1> yeah that's cool

2010-12-21T05:30:06  <Frontier> a string stream has a .str() method for conversion to string
2010-12-21T05:30:39  <Frontier> .str().c_str() could work in that case
2010-12-21T05:30:52  <antimatroid1> i'll play around
2010-12-21T05:31:03  <antimatroid1> string streams don't seem to like having \n work properly from them
2010-12-21T05:31:23  <antimatroid1> i'm adding the str and clear lines to the actual function call now
2010-12-21T05:31:28  <antimatroid1> so that will remove a lot of crap
2010-12-21T05:31:42  <Frontier> maybe you meant to use << endl; ?

2010-12-21T05:32:11  <Frontier> on file streams you usually use << endl which outputs '\n' and flushes the stream
2010-12-21T05:33:18  <Frontier> I was running the engine in a profiler, and there was pretty much nothing else showing up, but this method and the C/C++ runtime.

2010-12-21T06:25:34  <Erika> it slows down near the end
2010-12-21T06:25:40  <Erika> is there a lot going on?
2010-12-21T06:25:45  <antimatroid1> you should see when the engine runs :P

2010-12-21T06:26:29  <Erika> maybe itll be faster on my better computer

2010-12-21T06:27:07  <antimatroid1> the ai is really stupid atm
2010-12-21T06:27:20  <antimatroid1> you can also fuse your ants together, combining their hp to make a super ant
2010-12-21T06:27:27  <antimatroid1> and you win if you get an ant onto their base
2010-12-21T06:27:41  <antimatroid1> and you also can't see the entire map at hte start

2010-12-21T06:39:05  <sigh> why is it slow?
2010-12-21T06:39:22  <antimatroid1> possibly all the calls to output a string stream to a process
2010-12-21T06:39:25  <antimatroid1> hopefully that
2010-12-21T06:39:40  <sigh> profile the code?
2010-12-21T06:40:05  <sigh> well, it's only a prototype so probably doesn't matter
2010-12-21T06:40:10  <antimatroid1> it sort of outputs when it has something to output atm
2010-12-21T06:40:25  <antimatroid1> yeah, would still be nice to make sure the game engine wont always be that retardedly slow

2010-12-21T06:42:28  <sigh> how do you want?
2010-12-21T06:42:51  <antimatroid1> well if i add lines to a string stream then pass take it out into a string, it removes all the \n's
2010-12-21T06:43:02  <antimatroid1> and it wont let me declare a stringstream for my processes
2010-12-21T06:43:20  <sigh> that's odd

2010-12-21T07:06:09  <dmj111> antimatroid1: how are you putting the '\n' 's into the string stream?
2010-12-21T07:10:47  <antimatroid1> dmj111: tried both '\n' and endl
2010-12-21T07:11:21  <antimatroid1> trying a different method now, i might be able to just generate one lone string inside the process, then have a separate function to send it all in one sweep
2010-12-21T07:12:11  <antimatroid1> dmj111: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3/ you've seen this yeah?
2010-12-21T07:13:05  <antimatroid1> it does seem to give them to me if i do ss.str() though, then pass that string off to an output whatever
2010-12-21T07:15:46  <antimatroid1> Frontier: is it possible for the visualiser to animate between steps when i click forward?
2010-12-21T07:16:00  <antimatroid1> backwards is far less important
2010-12-21T07:16:24  <sigh> animate between steps?
2010-12-21T07:16:39  <antimatroid1> sigh: i can click forward and go between turns at my own pace
2010-12-21T07:16:44  <antimatroid1> but it doesn't animate when doing that
2010-12-21T07:17:00  <antimatroid1> like show the walks or fights, just bang, next state
2010-12-21T07:19:08  <Frontier> antimatroid: You want what? an animation between steps? It is possible. I can play the whole game backwards if you want.
2010-12-21T07:19:51  <antimatroid1> it makes it easier to see what happened between steps
2010-12-21T07:20:10  <antimatroid1> when i click forward now, it just shows me the next state, not what happened between
2010-12-21T07:21:03  <Frontier> It should have an option to play the move, wait, and replay indefinitly
2010-12-21T07:22:26  <antimatroid1> that could be cool
2010-12-21T07:22:53  <antimatroid1> i'm still fighting with output with the process
2010-12-21T07:22:59  <Frontier> I just don't feel like doing it right now, but I centered the map on the home bases so it is easier to follow the ants around
2010-12-21T07:23:04  <antimatroid1> fputs(outstream.str().c_str(), p.out);
2010-12-21T07:23:05  <antimatroid1> didn't love that
2010-12-21T07:23:14  <antimatroid1> even when trying to switch everything to endl
2010-12-21T07:23:56  <antimatroid1> i'm thinking of just generating an output string for each process from the << calls, then at the end of each lot of outputting, pass the whole string
2010-12-21T07:29:16  <Frontier> antimatroid1: You can use a combination of [space] and [left arrow] to repeatedly replay a turn
2010-12-21T07:30:18  <antimatroid1> Frontier: perfect :)
2010-12-21T07:38:24  <antimatroid1> bah, this should work!
2010-12-21T07:42:10  <antimatroid1> http://pastebin.com/5BeW765j
2010-12-21T07:42:27  <antimatroid1> how the hell does the top three lines of that work but the bottom two with or without the bottom line don't
2010-12-21T07:42:31  <antimatroid1> it gives the same bloody text
2010-12-21T07:49:45  <dmj111> antimatroid1: sorry, had to step away.  the endl shouldn't work on string stream.
2010-12-21T07:50:06  <antimatroid1> it seems to get them when i ask for the .str() of it
2010-12-21T07:50:16  <antimatroid1> but then when i pass those through to a process, it fails
2010-12-21T07:50:21  <antimatroid1> it's all blah
2010-12-21T07:50:29  <antimatroid1> dmj111: what do you think about the game thoung? :P
2010-12-21T07:50:30  <dmj111> yeah.... endl is more than adding "\n".
2010-12-21T07:50:39  <antimatroid1> yeah, it's flushing too?
2010-12-21T07:50:43  <dmj111> yes.
2010-12-21T07:51:00  <antimatroid1> so if i change all my endl
2010-12-21T07:51:05  <antimatroid1> s to \n would it work?
2010-12-21T07:51:34  <dmj111> its been a while, but if you are building a string, then yes.  But, if you are building a string, you probably need to call the .str() method.
2010-12-21T07:51:52  <dmj111> i haven't checked out the game yet.  been trying to go cold turkey for a while.
2010-12-21T07:52:32  <antimatroid1> hehe, fair call
2010-12-21T07:52:43  <antimatroid1> at least watch the sample game

2010-12-21T07:55:24  <dmj111> that is an update since the last time i looked.  looks neat.
2010-12-21T08:00:50  <dmj111> antimatroid1: the other thing you can do, is build up a list of strings that should have newlines between them.  then, to output them, loop through the lines, dump a line where you want to go , then the newline.
2010-12-21T08:02:03  <dmj111> but i imagine you are using the ostringstream to handle formatting for you, so that probably isn't too helpful.
2010-12-21T08:02:39  <dmj111> see ya later...

2010-12-21T11:25:08  <antimatroid1> rabidus: yes
2010-12-21T11:25:23  <antimatroid1> their harvest combines too
2010-12-21T11:25:34  <antimatroid1> that is fusion
2010-12-21T11:25:41  <antimatroid1> although i seem to be the only person who likes that
2010-12-21T11:26:07  <rabidus> hmm.. so, if i know where enemy base is, and make a "snake" towards it, and when first ant gets involved in a fight and i make a fusion with first and second ant
2010-12-21T11:26:21  <antimatroid1> then their hp combines
2010-12-21T11:26:26  <antimatroid1> that's why i like fusion :P
2010-12-21T11:26:38  <rabidus> yea, but isn't that too powerful?
2010-12-21T11:26:42  <antimatroid1> although, when i made that snake before, it did bery badly
2010-12-21T11:26:48  <antimatroid1> very*
2010-12-21T11:26:55  <antimatroid1> no, you lose a lot of ability fusing ants
2010-12-21T11:27:06  <antimatroid1> i think you're better off keeping them separate, even when charging their base
2010-12-21T11:27:33  <antimatroid1> they can fuse to defend against you too
2010-12-21T11:29:31  <rabidus> hmm..
2010-12-21T11:30:36  <rabidus> what about when ant A at 0,0 is moving right and ant B at 2,0 is moving left. what's at 1,0 in next turn?
2010-12-21T11:30:59  <antimatroid1> if they have the same hp, they both die and their harvest returns to grains their
2010-12-21T11:31:12  <antimatroid1> otherwise one surves and the other dies, dropping it'd harvest to grains again
2010-12-21T11:31:24  <antimatroid1> fuse happens before combat essentialy
2010-12-21T11:31:29  <antimatroid1> in reality  do them at the same time

2010-12-21T12:19:42  <Frontier> Fortune Faded is a song -.-.
2010-12-21T12:19:50  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-12-21T12:20:26  <Frontier> But I prefer Drakan, Half-Life, Company of Heroes or the Total War series
2010-12-21T12:20:52  <Frontier> Sure GTA was fun in multiplayer back then, too
2010-12-21T12:21:02  <Erika> onbly so many times you can rpelay something
2010-12-21T12:21:25  <antimatroid1> Erika: not true for tg motocross 3
2010-12-21T12:21:33  <Erika> like, I played OOT maybe 5 or 6 times
2010-12-21T12:21:43  <Erika> Idk if I could do another
2010-12-21T12:21:44  <Erika> well
2010-12-21T12:21:47  <Erika> maybe one more
2010-12-21T12:22:08  <Frontier> Gothic 3 was also an amazing game.
2010-12-21T12:22:56  <Erika> im about to play morroblivion
2010-12-21T12:23:03  <Erika> soon as everything finishes downloading
2010-12-21T12:23:40  <Frontier> downloading... hmm so is it from an online vendor?
2010-12-21T12:24:08  <Erika> no way
2010-12-21T12:24:12  <Frontier> or do you get your games you aren't keen for like I do in bit torrent networks
2010-12-21T12:24:25  <Erika> torrents
2010-12-21T12:24:42  <Erika> and the final patch for the mod is from the official site
2010-12-21T12:28:20  <rabidus> geez. great work guys. i like that game a lot
2010-12-21T12:30:45  <Frontier> Finally you say it. Damn I waited for that statement all day long :p

2010-12-21T12:37:59  <rabidus> yes
2010-12-21T12:38:16  <Frontier> I just downloaded that a few days back because I liked Link's Awakening. Not sure if I'll play it. The controls on an emulator for the PC are a bit unintuitive :-)
2010-12-21T12:38:57  <Frontier> I'll tell my sister though. She's so eager to play Zelda 1 at the moment, but can't get an emulator to run

2010-12-21T12:40:09  <Frontier> I'm using mednafen, which is an emulator that runs most old games including NES, GB, GBC, GBA and a lot of others.
2010-12-21T12:40:35  <Erika> oh hmm
2010-12-21T12:40:44  <Erika> I just use my n64
2010-12-21T12:41:02  <Erika> or this really cool thing my roomie has that plays nes and snes
2010-12-21T12:41:05  <Frontier> I'm amazed how good Link's awakening looks now, coming from a monochrome GameBoy. I tried the color version now with special filtering that makes the resolution look like it's 4x higher
2010-12-21T12:41:36  <Erika> woah
2010-12-21T12:41:44  <Erika> that sounds pretty neat
2010-12-21T12:42:49  <Frontier> The graphics are comic like anyway and the filter uses that. Basically you end up with lines going either -, |, / or \ . But it works on any shape that isn't a long flat arc.
2010-12-21T12:44:19  <Frontier> You don't get any blur from upscaling the images. That's really what gives you the impression of higher resolution
2010-12-21T12:46:01  <Frontier> here is an example (on the left) of how these filters work: http://img708.imageshack.us/i/winuaecomparison.png/sr=1

2010-12-21T13:24:16  <Erika> how are the bots controlling the ants restricted, besides sight
2010-12-21T13:28:47  <Frontier> there are no other restrictions. one bot just controls all of his ants and the engine/server gives it an update of the visible game world each turn
2010-12-21T13:29:48  <Frontier> well you can only do one action per ant per turn (walk/harvest/attack/deposit)

2010-12-21T14:21:20  <jmcarthur> that replay called epic demonstrates a flaw, i think
2010-12-21T14:21:52  <rabidus> where
2010-12-21T14:21:55  <jmcarthur> the ant hills became massive bottlenecks
2010-12-21T14:22:06  <jmcarthur> if you click on "epic" here http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/v3/
2010-12-21T14:22:31  <rabidus> aa, i was thinking like turn number or something :)
2010-12-21T14:22:40  <rabidus> but yeah, in the end
2010-12-21T14:22:56  <jmcarthur> the majority of the game is spent churning out ants and that's about it
2010-12-21T14:25:00  <delt0r___> it runs really slow on my FF
2010-12-21T14:25:20  <jmcarthur> works alright in chrome
2010-12-21T14:25:46  <Zannick> bottlenecked so hard
2010-12-21T14:26:12  <Zannick> it is not very interesting
2010-12-21T14:26:50  <jmcarthur> i think one of the things i don't like about this game from looking at it so far is that there doesn't seem to be much strategy to it. it would be more interesting with better maps though, i think
2010-12-21T14:27:05  <jmcarthur> as it is right now, resource gathering and fighting are two distinct activities
2010-12-21T14:27:06  <Erika> so... maybe if the place that churned out ants was actually a queen
2010-12-21T14:27:09  <Erika> and could move
2010-12-21T14:27:30  <Erika> thered be better usage of the territory

2010-12-21T14:27:41  <jmcarthur> there is not much strategy in choosing where to attack, and there is no real concept of choking off your opponent's resources
2010-12-21T14:28:34  <jmcarthur> might be more interesting if the resources were far away from the ant hill, leading to lines of ants that have real weak points and devastating consequences when they are broken
2010-12-21T14:28:49  <jmcarthur> and it would also be much more like an ant colony, to boot

2010-12-21T15:19:42  <jmcarthur> i think bringing tron back would be pretty awesome if we make it a variation
2010-12-21T15:20:22  <jmcarthur> each bot could control three bikes, maps could be larger to make more room for them, walls could be destroyed when their corresponding bikes are destroyed, and walls could block vision
2010-12-21T15:20:41  <jmcarthur> i think that would fundamentally change the game, but it would still be pretty simple
2010-12-21T15:22:36  <Zannick> it would indeed fundamentally change the game
2010-12-21T15:23:04  <Zannick> i like it
2010-12-21T15:23:40  <Zannick> i can imagine a scenario where it is better for a player to order a bike to destroy itself so that another bike is not destroyed, so that an enemy bike does not escape
2010-12-21T15:23:58  <jmcarthur> i'm making a forum post with the idea
2010-12-21T15:24:04  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-12-21T15:24:43  <jmcarthur> i also see some interesting strategies involving obscuring a bike behind a wall intentionally so that it can construct a maze to trap you opponent in, then when the wall is destroyed or circumvented the opponent gets a surprise
2010-12-21T15:24:57  <jmcarthur> *your opponent
2010-12-21T15:25:02  <jmcarthur> and so on

2010-12-21T15:41:58  <amstan> jmcarthur: i'm not saying it's a bad idea.. we just have to make sure the games are original enough that it doesn't get boring
2010-12-21T15:42:10  <amstan> we don't want to have tron every contest, regardless of how awesome it is
2010-12-21T15:42:17  <jmcarthur> right. my question is about what makes it too similar
2010-12-21T15:42:33  <amstan> well
2010-12-21T15:42:41  <jmcarthur> like... this is really nothing like the original when you get down to how you must approach it
2010-12-21T15:42:43  <amstan> it's still bicycles on a grid
2010-12-21T15:42:47  <amstan> same rules pretty much
2010-12-21T15:42:51  <amstan> you can use the same mapgen
2010-12-21T15:43:42  <Zannick> you'd want a bigger space
2010-12-21T15:43:46  <jmcarthur> much bigger
2010-12-21T15:43:59  <amstan> i know.. but like.. imagine some poor guy that kinda sucked at tron
2010-12-21T15:44:05  <amstan> wants to enter the contest again
2010-12-21T15:44:16  <amstan> and he's like: "ugh.. tron again? nah..."
2010-12-21T15:44:25  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure sucking at one implies sucking at the other
2010-12-21T15:44:25  <Zannick> imagine some poor guy who found out about the contest when the tron results were posted
2010-12-21T15:44:28  * Zannick 
2010-12-21T15:44:50  <Zannick> but let's do something else for now, at least
2010-12-21T15:44:56  <amstan> ok, fine
2010-12-21T15:45:04  <jmcarthur> how about 3 vs 3 snake? :P
2010-12-21T15:45:10  <amstan> like.. jmcarthur's is pretty diff than the old one, i agree

2010-12-21T20:40:45  <antimatroid1> Zannick:  is your only issue with ants the fact that so many show up in a game atm?
2010-12-21T20:41:09  <antimatroid1> the number of grains on a square can be limited, including home base starting grains, and it could require more than 1 grain to spawn a new ant etc.
2010-12-21T20:41:23  <antimatroid1> i just had it spitting out heaps so the stupid ai would end up colliding etc.
2010-12-21T20:49:42  <antimatroid1> Frontier: what are you doing to centre the maps? that really ought to be done at the genator level
2010-12-21T20:57:19  <sigh> antimatroid1: he just shifts by (home1 + home2)/2, with appropriate handling of wrapping
2010-12-21T20:58:46  <Zannick> antimatroid1: i'd recommend upping the grain per ant created, yeah
2010-12-21T20:59:15  <Zannick> but also the map generator needs a little improvement
2010-12-21T20:59:59  <Zannick> i may have other things but i just got home and i'm not thinking yet
2010-12-21T21:00:02  <sigh> antimatroid1: but either way, you don't really want the result to be centred in the generator, as that makes the base location predictable again
2010-12-21T21:01:59  <antimatroid1> Zannick: i do agree about there being too many ants though
2010-12-21T21:02:32  <Zannick> "epic" definitely illustrated that
2010-12-21T21:03:03  <antimatroid1> sigh: true, perhaps the engine could pass each player completely different coordinate information, ensuring that the generated map you see is the same as the one that shows up on the visualiser
2010-12-21T21:03:20  <antimatroid1> still not helpful for debugging though
2010-12-21T21:03:49  <antimatroid1> i'm thinking maybe requiring 5 grains on base for a new ant with hp 5?
2010-12-21T21:03:55  <sigh> I think everything should show the same coordinates
2010-12-21T21:03:59  <antimatroid1> and bases start with 20 grains and an ant
2010-12-21T21:04:23  <antimatroid1> sigh: the alternative is a shaded border around the actual map, showing the other side of the edge
2010-12-21T21:04:31  <antimatroid1> but limits the size of maps that will fit on the screen
2010-12-21T21:04:42  <sigh> why start with 20 grains rather than 4 ants?
2010-12-21T21:05:01  <antimatroid1> could start with 4 ants, they wont know the path home though
2010-12-21T21:05:21  <sigh> why?
2010-12-21T21:05:33  <antimatroid1> they can't all start on home base, they'd fuse
2010-12-21T21:05:54  <sigh> they can start out next to home
2010-12-21T21:05:56  <antimatroid1> you could start them within view of home i guess
2010-12-21T21:06:19  <antimatroid1> why not just spawn one each of the first 5 moves though?
2010-12-21T21:06:42  <sigh> just seems kind of pointless :P
2010-12-21T21:06:58  <sigh> justs adds delay with no purpose
2010-12-21T21:06:59  <antimatroid1> its easier and seems just as good as the alternative :P
2010-12-21T21:08:57  <sigh> how much do ants cost atm?

2010-12-21T21:15:34  <antimatroid1> sigh: 1 grain
2010-12-21T21:15:56  <antimatroid1> i had to up the number of ants earlier because the ai was real stupid
2010-12-21T21:16:00  <antimatroid1> it's slightly smarter as of last night
2010-12-21T21:16:37  <antimatroid1> each ant makes the move closest to something appealing, rather than making a random move
2010-12-21T21:18:30  <sigh> even if they are moving into a wall?
2010-12-21T21:21:15  <antimatroid1> an ant can't walk into a wall
2010-12-21T21:21:17  <antimatroid1> such a move is ignored
2010-12-21T21:21:29  <antimatroid1> the engine also doesn't stop an ant from making more than one move atm
2010-12-21T21:21:33  <antimatroid1> i'll fix that up later
2010-12-21T21:21:48  <antimatroid1> the bot wont execute more than one ant per move though, so the games are valid
