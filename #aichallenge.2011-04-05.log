2011-04-05T05:26:18  <Stocha> i have an adaptor that i made from the beginner bot of McLeopold
2011-04-05T05:26:40  <Stocha> maybe it is old enougth not to conform anymore though. But that won't be hard to correct.
2011-04-05T05:27:06  <Stocha> but maybe "protocol" wasn't clear enough :p
2011-04-05T05:27:25  <Stocha> i meant by it  : how do we exchange the exec, who runs them ? is javabot okay for you ? :p
2011-04-05T05:27:57  <Stocha> @later tell keth by "protocole" i mean, where do i send the exec (or do you), who runs the experiments ? how do we provide the result to the other ?
2011-04-05T05:27:57  <contestbot> Stocha: Job's done.
2011-04-05T05:30:53  <Stocha> maybe i should just provide a link to the exec so people can use it to test their bot. It's pretty simple anyway.
2011-04-05T05:31:12  <Stocha> i mean that isn't a bot that will win the competition. It is more an advanced starter bot :p
2011-04-05T05:32:52  <antimatroid> Stocha: he is using c++, so if you can provide him with a runnable compiled version that'd be best
2011-04-05T05:32:57  <antimatroid> that way neither of you see each others source
2011-04-05T05:33:00  <Stocha> @later tell keth okay here is what i propose : i will try to put the bot on a http link tonight (greenwich meridian) Then you can play with it, and tell me :p
2011-04-05T05:33:00  <contestbot> Stocha: Job's done.
2011-04-05T05:33:08  <Stocha> i'm using java.
2011-04-05T05:33:31  <antimatroid> yeah, so you should be able to give a jar version of it that doesn't have the source viewable?
2011-04-05T05:33:34  <Stocha> i can provide a McLeopold like java bot. that's it.
2011-04-05T05:33:46  <Stocha> java code is always viewable.
2011-04-05T05:34:05  <antimatroid> hmmm, okay, we need tcp :P
2011-04-05T05:34:08  <Stocha> you can try to obscate it. but i wouldn't count too much on that. And i don't want to put time into it :p
2011-04-05T05:34:20  <Stocha> obfuscate it
2011-04-05T05:34:44  <Stocha> you have tools for obfuscating java, but i don't want to spend the 10 minutes or so i would need to do that.
2011-04-05T05:34:53  <antimatroid> yeah neither would i
2011-04-05T05:35:24  <Stocha> so if people want to read it, i just want to state that i dissallow that formally !
2011-04-05T05:35:43  <Stocha> yeah. really. i may take proper lawsuit or i don't know what.
2011-04-05T05:35:52  <Stocha> yeah. burn them hackers.

2011-04-05T05:46:44  <antimatroid> sigh: is that neighbourhood offsets stuff your fastest vision code?
2011-04-05T05:47:05  <sigh> fastest vision code is in fast-vision branch
2011-04-05T05:47:23  <sigh> note that that is fastest for *python*
2011-04-05T05:48:24  <sigh> I wouldn't do it the same way in (for example) C++ if I was going for speed
2011-04-05T05:49:33  <antimatroid> how would you do it in c++ for speed?
2011-04-05T05:51:32  <sigh> I would profile the painting algorithm vs a modified version of the current vision algorithm where I cached only the bounds of the vision radius
2011-04-05T05:52:13  <sigh> my bet would be that painting is still slower
2011-04-05T05:54:06  <sigh> also note that the incremental method more difficult to implement in the bots than the engine
2011-04-05T05:54:22  <sigh> so that can slow things down too
2011-04-05T05:54:39  <sigh> ok, I'm going to merge fast-vision in
2011-04-05T05:54:44  <antimatroid> i might just store all offsets for vision in my start up time then check for all ants using that
2011-04-05T05:56:27  <sigh> in a language like c++ you are better of storing just (start_col_offset, end_col_offset) for each row_offset

2011-04-05T07:03:52  <Frontier> ah this is like in battle for wesnoth, where you get the production of all towns * remaining turns as a bonus
2011-04-05T07:08:06  <Frontier> sigh: do you write scores for bots that already died?
2011-04-05T07:08:24  <sigh> Frontier: yes
2011-04-05T07:09:43  <Frontier>  You don't need to. I'd like to use the length of the score array to tell when a bot died/crashed/etc and I replicate the last score to the end already.
2011-04-05T07:11:04  <Frontier> see 's' in the replay specs
2011-04-05T07:12:51  <Frontier> This is a strange situation. I tell people to look at the official specs that I just made up some afternoon myself. ^^
2011-04-05T07:22:46  *** BtbN_ is now known as BtbN
2011-04-05T07:24:55  <Stocha> why is it strange ?
2011-04-05T07:25:32  <Stocha> @seen phire
2011-04-05T07:25:32  <contestbot> Stocha: phire was last seen in #aichallenge 16 hours, 33 minutes, and 25 seconds ago: <phire> It spends 60% of the game just sitting there doing nothing, and it still practically draws with hunter bot.

2011-04-05T07:46:26  <antimatroid> i would like at least 500 milliseconds guaranteed per bot
2011-04-05T07:46:31  <antimatroid> 1000 would be better
2011-04-05T07:48:44  <Stocha> is that on a 64bits processor ?
2011-04-05T07:48:55  <Stocha> with a 64 bits jvm :p
2011-04-05T07:50:03  <antimatroid> jvm?
2011-04-05T07:57:24  <Frontier> must be an insider about slow 64-bit jvms from sun
2011-04-05T07:58:05  <Frontier> http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-64-bit-java-is-slow.html
2011-04-05T08:03:03  <Frontier> A problem I see with most programming languages is that they settled for 32-bit ints. There should really be an obvious short keyword for architecture dependent ints. 'machine_word' is a bad option for example: "for (machine_word i = 0; i < 12; i++) { ... }"
2011-04-05T08:09:26  <Frontier> You can't do that with a compile once run everywhere language though :p
2011-04-05T08:10:42  <Stocha> i use long shift. So i guess it's faster with 64 bits jvm. i would like it too at least. Anyway, i have no 32bits systems to test on.

2011-04-05T08:35:07  <Frontier> I think I have an issue blocking the release date: Loading the huge replay antimatroid gave me takes 97 seconds and uses 2 GB of RAM in Opera.
2011-04-05T08:35:39  <Frontier> I know you all have 4 GB of RAM, but still it could be less :p
2011-04-05T08:36:01  <Stocha> what kind of huge replay is that ?
2011-04-05T08:36:08  <Stocha> what game settings.
2011-04-05T08:41:25  <Frontier> Map: 120x120, Turns: 500, Viewradius²: 96
2011-04-05T08:43:12  <Stocha> is that a real time spooling ?
2011-04-05T08:44:06  <Stocha> or standard offline text format ?
2011-04-05T08:44:10  <Stocha> how many players ?
2011-04-05T08:44:17  <Stocha> lots of food ?
2011-04-05T08:44:53  <Stocha> oh it's not the input file that is really bit. it's your internal representation i guess :p
2011-04-05T08:44:54  <Frontier> That is the offline text format (storage format) with 4 players and quite some food: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game_id=3

2011-04-05T08:51:39  <Stocha> 376 kb --> 2GB is a big ratio i guess :p
2011-04-05T08:52:58  <Stocha> would it be hard to use an internal  serverstate frame representation and only transform it to picture when you need to ?

2011-04-05T09:01:48  <Frontier> So all the little temporary variables, arrays and objects keep adding up.

2011-04-05T09:18:29  <Frontier> the solution to making it fast again is to only verify the replay on load and turn it into the internal representation on demand.
2011-04-05T09:19:15  <Frontier> oh and I see that I don't seem to cache replays. either that or the browsers refuse to cache files of that size

2011-04-05T10:49:15  <Stocha> hi phire what's up ?
2011-04-05T10:49:33  <phire> good question
2011-04-05T10:49:55  <Stocha> i have made my bot available for those who want to do local testing against an average bot :p
2011-04-05T10:50:18  <Stocha> the old one you saw on my demos.
2011-04-05T10:51:15  <phire> it would totally own my bot in its current state
2011-04-05T10:51:27  <Stocha> probably But it gives a mean to test bots.
2011-04-05T10:51:47  <Stocha> even if you have only 20% win, that's a good idea of bot performances.
2011-04-05T10:52:02  <Stocha> and people will be able to try multiplayer games and see what they think of it :p
2011-04-05T10:52:04  <phire> but I can probally fix that in a few 30 min
2011-04-05T10:52:08  <Stocha> hopefully they will hate them :p
2011-04-05T10:52:16  <Stocha> ah good :)
2011-04-05T10:52:19  <phire> if I actually make it target enemies, it will do a lot better
2011-04-05T10:52:28  <Stocha> so you have built a strong bot, but it's broken ?
2011-04-05T10:54:12  <phire> its easier to test the scheduling system when its doing less
2011-04-05T10:54:43  <Stocha> ah you have built a scheduling system :)
2011-04-05T10:54:51  <phire> well the start of one
2011-04-05T10:54:53  <Stocha> i'm still to do that.
2011-04-05T10:55:09  <Stocha> i have parts of scheduling. That probably can't fit together anyway.
2011-04-05T10:55:40  <Stocha> I've set up my mind to do style exercise at the moment. So i'm trying to build a bot that loose with style :p
2011-04-05T10:55:51  <Stocha> at least i do make some progress that way.
2011-04-05T10:58:14  <phire> hmm
2011-04-05T10:58:19  <phire> its not working

2011-04-05T11:05:02  <Stocha> so it does work now ? :p
2011-04-05T11:15:15  <Stocha> once you have stabilized a strategy, post some results (ideally after a few 100 or 1000 games :p )
2011-04-05T11:15:42  <Stocha> I would love to see results for multiplayers also. Like 3 vs 1
2011-04-05T11:15:59  <Stocha> both 3 strong vs 1 lesser. And 3 lesser vs 1 strong.
2011-04-05T11:16:17  <Stocha> I never tested the provided map generators also yet.
2011-04-05T11:17:23  <phire> ok, lets build my scheduler
2011-04-05T11:19:22  <phire> then it might actually start winning

2011-04-05T14:27:33  <Stocha> it's only easy to reverse engineer
2011-04-05T14:27:42  <Stocha> only someone malicious would do that
2011-04-05T14:27:55  <Stocha> it's hundreds of times easier than it is with c
2011-04-05T14:28:08  <Stocha> but if you let debut info in c code, it's more than doable.
2011-04-05T14:28:18  <Stocha> i modified sim city rules, when i was young :p
2011-04-05T14:28:25  <antimatroid> by reverse engineer to you mean inspecting the contents of the jar file or actually decompiling it?
2011-04-05T14:28:30  <antimatroid> if the later, then that's alright :)
2011-04-05T14:28:33  <Stocha> decompiling it.
2011-04-05T14:28:43  <Stocha> but all debug info are in by default.
2011-04-05T14:28:44  <antimatroid> ignore my above comments :P
2011-04-05T14:28:54  <Stocha> you have to do something drastic to somewhat hide them
2011-04-05T14:29:17  <antimatroid> i can strip all my debug stuff when compiling by commenting 1 line
2011-04-05T14:29:41  <antimatroid> and i just "bug << "this is my error stuff" << state << endl" to debug
2011-04-05T14:31:30  <Stocha> i once decompiled a full java application (to test risks of being hacked). The decompiled version was actuallly more readable than the source java code.
2011-04-05T14:32:06  <Stocha> i never tryed again, but i Know that without obfuscation giving the jar, is like giving the code. Without the comments.
2011-04-05T14:32:43  <Stocha> You have full access to class name, method names, propriety names, etc.
2011-04-05T14:33:25  <Stocha> Still, you have to get your hand on a decompilation software.
2011-04-05T14:33:48  <Stocha> (which you can have for free but well). And then, it is illegal in a lot of place to do that :p
2011-04-05T14:35:29  <Stocha> Well by debut info i meant the functions names :)
2011-04-05T14:35:32  <Stocha> and signature.
2011-04-05T14:36:26  <Stocha> anyway nobody reads the forums :p
2011-04-05T14:37:06  <Stocha> i doubt they will try to read my code. good for them if they try (and they'll go to jail)
2011-04-05T14:37:23  <Stocha> Further more, the bot is really basic.
2011-04-05T14:42:31  <Stocha> all the ideas implemented in it, if have seen some people discussing already :)

2011-04-05T15:40:51  <Keth> Anybody else have difficulty with Stocha bot? Every replay with Stocha bot gets this error: Error stack: Number of orders does not match life span.
2011-04-05T15:42:16  <Keth> might be problem with his bot, will need to ask once he's on
2011-04-05T15:42:23  <Frontier> sounds funny. it seems to exploit a security hole in the engine, causing it to emit invalid data
2011-04-05T15:42:55  <Keth> true
2011-04-05T15:42:57  <Keth> you had the same thing?
2011-04-05T15:43:21  <Keth> I can get the output of ants e.g. [9, 8, 38, 40] at the end
2011-04-05T15:43:35  <Keth> and I can see "END"
2011-04-05T15:43:40  <Keth> but the replay seems corrupted
2011-04-05T15:44:43  <Frontier> I once reported a bug about this symptom (number of orders ...). sigh then fixed the engine.
2011-04-05T15:45:19  <Frontier> Later on I heard about a bot sending invalid orders, causing a bug in the engine. It may be related
2011-04-05T15:47:16  <Keth> I see
2011-04-05T15:47:46  <Frontier> The nice thing about working on the visualizer is that most bugs are easily spotted ^^. But I have to fight with performance issues.
2011-04-05T15:49:58  <Keth> I actually don't get how his bot works
2011-04-05T15:50:10  <Keth> I'm not sure if you looked at it
2011-04-05T15:52:46  <Keth> I might've just fixed it

2011-04-05T21:19:23  <Stocha> nice the mirror thing at the edges :)
2011-04-05T21:20:05  <Frontier> It was requested long ago and I finally got to implement it.
2011-04-05T21:20:07  <Stocha> although it seems to make it hard to zoom
2011-04-05T21:20:14  <Stocha> how do i zoom :'(
2011-04-05T21:20:29  <Stocha> i downloaded chrome today. For using your visualizer only :p
2011-04-05T21:20:32  <Frontier> why does everyone want to zoom ?
2011-04-05T21:20:59  <Frontier> Chrome is the fastest, but it doesn't render shadows under buttons like Opera and Firefox
2011-04-05T21:21:24  <Stocha> because we don't see anything if we don't zoom ?
2011-04-05T21:22:11  <Stocha> where are the map generators ?
2011-04-05T21:22:18  <Frontier> hmm, what if i just zoom to the center and you drag the map as you like?
2011-04-05T21:22:20  <Stocha> are there in the git repository somewhere ?
2011-04-05T21:22:45  <Stocha> that's good enougth frontier. As long as we can see what's going on in there :p
2011-04-05T21:22:50  <Frontier> yes they are in the ants directory
2011-04-05T21:23:31  <Frontier> Take a look: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/5fb53fdf71dfa6a8515a218a7a5f29a5cb70df53/ants/mapgen
2011-04-05T21:25:35  <Stocha> there even is a java version !
2011-04-05T21:25:52  <Frontier> One improvement a day. I'll add a simple zoom tomorrow that scales squares to 10x10 pixels
2011-04-05T21:28:34  <Stocha> okay let's try it, i think that will be okay :)
2011-04-05T21:31:11  <Stocha> i tryed the mapgen over my dev tools
2011-04-05T21:31:26  <Stocha> i guess it'll be easy to use with my own framework with few work :p
2011-04-05T21:31:35  <Stocha> i'll post some applet later, maybe.
2011-04-05T21:32:06  <Stocha> although at this point it's probably more interesting to have different bots compares.
