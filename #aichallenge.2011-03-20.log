2011-03-20T02:00:30  <antimatroid> what's a zombie process?
2011-03-20T02:02:48  <janzert> http://www.brighthub.com/computing/linux/articles/79186.aspx
2011-03-20T02:02:59  <janzert> seems to be a pretty good description
2011-03-20T02:04:49  <antimatroid> okay cool
2011-03-20T02:05:04  <antimatroid> my process thing is creating them
2011-03-20T02:05:31  <antimatroid> they die when the parent program exits, but i want to be able to kill them off before that
2011-03-20T02:06:01  *** ravic <ravic!~ravi@118-93-167-37.dsl.dyn.ihug.co.nz> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-03-20T02:08:18  <janzert> http://www.makelinux.net/alp/026.htm might help you with that
2011-03-20T02:08:56  <janzert> assuming whatever your process thing is, is in c/c++
2011-03-20T02:12:27  <antimatroid> it sort of is
2011-03-20T02:12:33  <antimatroid> i need to do the whole wait thing
2011-03-20T02:13:04  <antimatroid> but their example just declares an int then says wait(that int) but doesn't do anything with the int before? wtf?
2011-03-20T02:13:28  <antimatroid> the 3.4.2 section
2011-03-20T02:13:42  <antimatroid> is there a "alt tab" for switching desktops?
2011-03-20T02:13:55  <sigh> no, it says wait(address of that in)
2011-03-20T02:14:01  <sigh> it's an output value
2011-03-20T02:14:25  <janzert> the int is filled with the child status
2011-03-20T02:14:34  <janzert> see http://linux.die.net/man/2/wait
2011-03-20T02:26:44  <antimatroid> hmmm i don't know how to get the process ID :P
2011-03-20T02:26:55  <antimatroid> each process has FILE in,out;
2011-03-20T02:27:31  <sigh> pid of processes that you are creating, or pid of processes you are waiting on?
2011-03-20T02:27:58  <antimatroid> I have a process struct
2011-03-20T02:28:24  <antimatroid> i didn't write the start function, it's that same one i've been fixing up for a while
2011-03-20T02:28:25  <sigh> how did you create the process?
2011-03-20T02:29:25  <sigh> either way, you don't need the pid to wait
2011-03-20T02:29:37  <antimatroid> what do i need?
2011-03-20T02:29:59  <antimatroid> i don't get how just the address of some random int tells you the status of some other running process :\
2011-03-20T02:30:18  <antimatroid> surely that int needs to be linked to the process in some way?
2011-03-20T02:30:33  <sigh> the return value of wait is the pid
2011-03-20T02:30:44  <sigh> and it won't be running anymore by that point
2011-03-20T02:31:14  <antimatroid> err what, but i might have a bunch of these processes running
2011-03-20T02:31:21  <antimatroid> how does it know which one i'm calling wait on?
2011-03-20T02:31:57  <sigh> wait() waits until any child process finishes up
2011-03-20T02:32:21  <sigh> if you want to wait for a specific process then there is a version of wait which takes more arguments
2011-03-20T02:32:46  <antimatroid> let me see where i get with just wait
2011-03-20T02:32:48  <antimatroid> cheers
2011-03-20T02:32:53  <antimatroid> janzert: thanks too
2011-03-20T02:33:07  <sigh> wait() basically says "I can't continue until my children have finished processing", so tell me when one finishes
2011-03-20T02:34:28  <sigh> if you just want to wait until all children have finished then put wait in a while loop
2011-03-20T02:36:29  <antimatroid> the children still seem to become zombies until my parent process exits
2011-03-20T02:40:19  <sigh> what are you doing?
2011-03-20T02:42:55  <sigh> I mean, the absolute bare-bones thing to do is while(wait() != -1); but that doesn't do any error checking or anything
2011-03-20T02:44:44  <antimatroid> no error checking is fine
2011-03-20T02:45:47  <antimatroid> that doesn't compile :P
2011-03-20T02:46:30  <sigh> oh, well wait needs to take that int *status argument
2011-03-20T02:47:23  <antimatroid> still wont compile :P
2011-03-20T02:47:38  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/XDApjjwB
2011-03-20T02:47:52  <antimatroid> that's my function, the for loop is where i'm trying to get a process to end properly
2011-03-20T02:50:35  <antimatroid> i've tried the wait in any (un)obvious place
2011-03-20T02:51:03  <sigh> what's the error?
2011-03-20T02:52:19  <sigh> well, you don't want to wait until after you have finished talking to the proccess
2011-03-20T02:53:17  <sigh> remember, the wait is for when you are waiting for the child to finish, if the child is trying to write to you then waiting will just result in a deadlock
2011-03-20T02:55:20  <antimatroid> it doesn't result in a deadlock
2011-03-20T02:55:24  <antimatroid> it runs fine :\
2011-03-20T02:55:42  <antimatroid> i don't think wait is waiting for anything
2011-03-20T02:55:50  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/NCDazQr8
2011-03-20T02:56:04  <antimatroid> that's the error i get for "while(wait(*test) != -1);"
2011-03-20T02:57:21  <antimatroid> my bad, http://pastebin.com/PufT2NJb for &test
2011-03-20T02:57:28  <antimatroid> i had tried both, both hated me
2011-03-20T02:59:19  <sigh> did you #include <sys/wait.h>
2011-03-20T03:00:24  <sigh> either way, this seems like something the process class should be taking care of
2011-03-20T03:00:45  <sigh> *shrug*
2011-03-20T03:02:48  <antimatroid> it would be, i want to work out how to first :P
2011-03-20T03:02:52  <antimatroid> i'll play some more
2011-03-20T03:04:27  <sigh> also, why do you have a vector of processes when you only have one child process at a time?
2011-03-20T03:05:03  <antimatroid> well, i currently don't have a way to cleanly close and reopen the same process object
2011-03-20T03:05:07  <antimatroid> but i'm working on that now
2011-03-20T03:05:19  <antimatroid> and i seem to have got somewhere by including sys/wait.h :D, cheers
2011-03-20T03:05:28  <antimatroid> i'll keep playing now till it's clean
2011-03-20T03:05:56  <antimatroid> is sys/wait.h on windows too?
2011-03-20T03:06:42  <antimatroid> not that it matters too much to me now, but i might as well try and keep it working on everything now
2011-03-20T03:08:04  <sigh> no, unless you something that enumlates a unix environment like cygwin or minggw
2011-03-20T03:08:31  <sigh> I don't know anything about windows programming though
2011-03-20T03:08:54  <antimatroid> i use mingw usually
2011-03-20T03:09:09  <antimatroid> mingw is nice
2011-03-20T03:22:29  <antimatroid> okay i can now reuse it :)
2011-03-20T03:22:31  <antimatroid> cheers again
2011-03-20T03:26:36  *** Stocha <Stocha!5243b292@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.67.178.146> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-20T03:39:36  <Stocha> The problem with using both friendy and ennemy ant, is that it is even slower :/
2011-03-20T03:40:23  <Stocha> If you go with counting nearby ants, give a quick efficient algorithm with every starter kit :p
2011-03-20T03:40:37  <Stocha> though that really is intuitive
2011-03-20T03:41:30  <Stocha> but that would allow blocking unless it is either statistical. Or it always allow to reach contact point some way or others
2011-03-20T03:41:49  <Stocha> at distance 1, you can maximum be 3 vs 3 i think
2011-03-20T03:42:19  <Stocha> so worst blocking scenario would be a 1 corridor like in my gif
2011-03-20T03:42:27  <Stocha> .b.
2011-03-20T03:42:35  <Stocha> bbb
2011-03-20T03:42:39  <Stocha> .a.
2011-03-20T03:42:47  <Stocha> ah no
2011-03-20T03:42:50  <Stocha> %b%
2011-03-20T03:42:52  <Stocha> bbb
2011-03-20T03:42:56  <Stocha> %a%
2011-03-20T03:42:59  <Stocha> %.%
2011-03-20T03:43:01  <Stocha> %.%
2011-03-20T03:43:14  <Stocha> so it is 2 vs 3 here
2011-03-20T03:43:36  <Stocha> if two vs three always die that a is blocked there.
2011-03-20T03:44:41  <Stocha> Life point or statistical will solve that.
2011-03-20T03:45:14  <Stocha> But then we have double slow counting ennemy and friendly units. And have complex state (life point) or tricky testing (statistical)
2011-03-20T03:46:08  <Stocha> I understand that everyone wants complex fighting. I really think we have to something straight forward and fast to calculate for it to be good.
2011-03-20T03:48:32  <antimatroid> Stocha: how is it slower?
2011-03-20T03:58:48  <antimatroid> iterators are really just structs inside structs yeah?
2011-03-20T03:59:17  <antimatroid> why not template the iterator with the type it is point to, then you can use a template to create an iterator for your template type
2011-03-20T04:03:07  <antimatroid> it, taking a template Game,
2011-03-20T04:03:07  <antimatroid> Game::NStrategy doesn't work, but
2011-03-20T04:03:08  <antimatroid> NStrategy<Game> would
2011-03-20T04:06:38  <antimatroid> oh, but then you'd need to name them all differently
2011-03-20T04:06:40  <antimatroid> that doesn't help me

2011-03-20T04:12:23  <Stocha> fast is : logic bit operation and simple addition. Anything else is slow. Then there is the consideration of Complexity against the total number of ants in the worst case.
2011-03-20T04:12:52  <Stocha> fast is O(n) (with low multiplicator) where n is total number of ant present on the map.
2011-03-20T04:13:12  <Stocha> Ant dies in sames square falls into that categorie.
2011-03-20T04:13:27  <antimatroid> Stocha: it doesn't really matter provided it's fair
2011-03-20T04:13:32  <antimatroid> the simple rules are boring
2011-03-20T04:13:43  <antimatroid> you're one of the few people i know of who think they aren't
2011-03-20T04:16:11  <Stocha> i don't think they aren't. I just think it might be too soon
2011-03-20T04:16:23  <Stocha> and that they have to be lighting fast to compute and testcase.
2011-03-20T04:16:38  <Stocha> then i will be happy to have whatever complexity.
2011-03-20T04:16:42  *** delt0r___ <delt0r___!~delt0r@188-22-23-85.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-20T04:16:43  <Stocha> and big tree solvers and such.
2011-03-20T04:17:33  <Stocha> but if it's hard to compute, to undestand the spec, and to implement an  unoptimized version, then i'm really worrying.
2011-03-20T04:17:51  <Stocha> because that will not be fun for most casual people willing to participate.

2011-03-20T04:18:43  <Stocha> People will want to solve interesting games. Not to debug / optimize their code for month, before starting to really work on the ai challenge itself.
2011-03-20T04:19:32  <Stocha> So if you think complexity is good, make it linear in the number of ant, and easy to understand/ check for rightness if implementation.
2011-03-20T04:22:43  <sigh> it is linear in the number of ants, because you only need to check a constant number of map positions per ant
2011-03-20T04:27:07  <Stocha> constant time would be even better :p
2011-03-20T04:28:32  <sigh> well, that would be doing no attacks what so every
2011-03-20T04:28:43  <sigh> *ever
2011-03-20T04:29:03  <Stocha> In my case it was not linear : i would find the ennemy ant by checking the shape around. Then iterate over the enemies to count them :p
2011-03-20T04:29:30  <Stocha> I made a post about a rock/scisor/paper combat for ants.
2011-03-20T04:29:42  <Stocha> but the post got lost when it asked me to login again.
2011-03-20T04:30:09  <Stocha> I think the success of tron and planet wars as AI challenge, came from the simplicity of thoses games.
2011-03-20T04:30:20  <Stocha> You had straight forward rules, very easy to understand.
2011-03-20T04:30:22  <sigh> all the methods are constant time per ant, if that's what you mean
2011-03-20T04:30:48  <Stocha> Then you could put all your mind into solving them. Not debugging for years, or trying to understand what the heck those specs means.
2011-03-20T04:31:08  <Stocha> no constant time doesn't depends on ant numbers.
2011-03-20T04:31:12  <janzert> people manage to make sort O(n**2) instead of O(n log n) all the time too, it's not the fault of sorting ;)
2011-03-20T04:31:37  <Stocha> You can sort in linear time also.
2011-03-20T04:31:42  <sigh> Stocha: the current methods are constant time per ant
2011-03-20T04:31:47  <Stocha> Think how child sort out cards on the table.
2011-03-20T04:32:06  <sigh> with a vision radius of 6, a constant number (21) of map positions need to be checked
2011-03-20T04:32:22  <Stocha> You take cards one by one, you put them "at their right place on the table", 1 place for each 52 cards, then you stack them one by one, sorted.
2011-03-20T04:32:36  <janzert> yes, see radix sort
2011-03-20T04:32:45  <sigh> or bucket sorting
2011-03-20T04:33:14  <janzert> of course they come with other limitations though
2011-03-20T04:33:32  <Stocha> As i use bit maps, i have time linear in the number of long it take to bitmap the map, for solving collisions.
2011-03-20T04:33:43  <sigh> doesn't work on things which you can't compare with the bit representation
2011-03-20T04:33:50  <Stocha> yeah that O(***) is meaningless i guess :p
2011-03-20T04:33:54  <sigh> (re limitations)
2011-03-20T04:34:10  <Stocha> what are the sort of thing you can't compare with bit representations ?
2011-03-20T04:34:14  <Stocha> i don't get it :p
2011-03-20T04:34:33  <Stocha> How do you compare them then ? With quantical representation ? :p
2011-03-20T04:34:48  <sigh> say a simple implementation of rational numbers
2011-03-20T04:34:57  <Stocha> what ??
2011-03-20T04:35:40  <Stocha> You mean complex bit comparison then :p
2011-03-20T04:35:40  <sigh> if you store a rational number as a pair (numerator, denominator) sorting their bit representation wont sort by value
2011-03-20T04:35:55  <sigh> then radix sorts wont work
2011-03-20T04:36:03  <janzert> Stocha: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort if you're not familiar with radix sort
2011-03-20T04:36:15  <Stocha> what if you keep them by pair of reduced numbers ?
2011-03-20T04:36:16  <sigh> you are into general comparision sorts which have a optimal bound of O(n log(n))
2011-03-20T04:36:19  <janzert> I'm pretty sure it explains the limitations sigh is refering to
2011-03-20T04:36:32  <sigh> Stocha: how will reduced numbers help?
2011-03-20T04:37:17  <sigh> for example, the following is in sorted order in reduced repr: (1,3), (1,2), (2,3), (1,1), (2,1)
2011-03-20T04:37:23  <Stocha> you have only one representation for any number then ?
2011-03-20T04:37:24  <janzert> anyway have fun, 4:30am so I really should go to bed ;)
2011-03-20T04:37:46  <sigh> Stocha: yes, but that representation doesn't work for radix sort
2011-03-20T04:38:13  <sigh> you can make a representation for rationals that work for radix sort, but that isn't good for adding and multiplying them
2011-03-20T04:38:15  <Stocha> let's be discussing about the game then, as it appears i'm somewhat lacking in algorithmic culture :p
2011-03-20T04:38:47  <Stocha> I hate numbers since i heard of uncountable sets anyway.
2011-03-20T04:39:16  <sigh> well I was only talking about rationals, which are countable
2011-03-20T04:39:19  <Stocha> especially when you try to trick me into "infinit set of whatever"
2011-03-20T04:39:56  <Stocha> that's still bigger than a 64 bits operand.
2011-03-20T04:40:23  <Stocha> one number being an infinite string with ununderstable rules for comparison :p
2011-03-20T04:40:52  <Stocha> so let's be on about the need for simplicity.
2011-03-20T04:41:10  <Stocha> Anywhere i look i see people asking for "complex interesting ant game" :'(
2011-03-20T04:41:16  <Stocha> what can i do about that ?
2011-03-20T04:41:19  <antimatroid> why do you want basic?
2011-03-20T04:41:37  <sigh> Stocha: by complex they mean they want the emergent strategies to be complex, not the rules
2011-03-20T04:41:44  <Stocha> Why do i beleave it has to be easy to implement and test for ? like less than 4 days to have an engine work fast.
2011-03-20T04:41:57  <antimatroid> without a good battle resolution i am worried the game would just be fastest to find food and not be stupid
2011-03-20T04:42:12  <antimatroid> you don't need to make your own engine
2011-03-20T04:42:28  <Stocha> You have to, if you want to build a solver
2011-03-20T04:42:37  <antimatroid> lol, no you don't
2011-03-20T04:42:47  <Stocha> you won't be able to make a tree of anything, if you don't have rules for calculating the next nodes.
2011-03-20T04:42:50  <antimatroid> you need to emulate some things, but you don't need your own working engine
2011-03-20T04:42:57  <antimatroid> yes, but that isn't an engine
2011-03-20T04:42:57  <Stocha> same goes with montecarlo trees.
2011-03-20T04:43:12  <Stocha> Yeah, thoses things need to be easy to emulate then.
2011-03-20T04:43:20  <antimatroid> they are
2011-03-20T04:43:24  <Stocha> less than a full day work for unoptimized.
2011-03-20T04:43:28  <antimatroid> you don't just go with the most trivial option
2011-03-20T04:43:31  <antimatroid> you go with the most interesting
2011-03-20T04:43:35  <Stocha> and with few risk of getting wrong.
2011-03-20T04:43:43  <antimatroid> that's stupid
2011-03-20T04:43:57  <Stocha> planet wars is such a game.
2011-03-20T04:43:59  <Stocha> so is tron.
2011-03-20T04:44:05  <Stocha> (they are even simpler i guess but well)
2011-03-20T04:44:06  <antimatroid> planet wars wasn't so simple
2011-03-20T04:44:14  <antimatroid> and there were lots of little fiddly bits here and there
2011-03-20T04:44:15  <Stocha> what rues are hard to test ?
2011-03-20T04:44:23  <Stocha> rules
2011-03-20T04:44:30  <antimatroid> there was a huge fuss over battle resolution for that
2011-03-20T04:44:35  <sigh> planet wars has annoying battle resolution, and a few bugs sprang up during the comp
2011-03-20T04:44:44  <antimatroid> and the tiniest change in things caused a huge change in optimal strategies
2011-03-20T04:44:46  <Stocha> You have planet regeneration, and then ships, and then ships order
2011-03-20T04:44:55  <antimatroid> it was very hard to make any visible progress after a while as well
2011-03-20T04:45:09  <Stocha> progress at what ? bot strength ?
2011-03-20T04:45:14  <antimatroid> yes
2011-03-20T04:45:20  <Stocha> why is it that a bot totally overclassed the others then ?
2011-03-20T04:45:25  <antimatroid> most people seemed to hit a brick wall after a while
2011-03-20T04:45:31  <antimatroid> because mega1 is mega
2011-03-20T04:45:36  <Stocha> that would go for any challenge.
2011-03-20T04:45:40  <antimatroid> he pantsed everybody
2011-03-20T04:45:51  <antimatroid> not like that, tron had no such wall
2011-03-20T04:46:01  <antimatroid> and i expect people to find a lot more to write stuff for with this than pw
2011-03-20T04:46:01  <Stocha> He solved it better than the other. He won the challenge.
2011-03-20T04:46:18  <Stocha> ah, tron didn't have the wall, okay. you have a point then.
2011-03-20T04:46:28  <Stocha> didn't people had fun with planet war ?
2011-03-20T04:46:30  <antimatroid> that's another reason for now just having the most basic game mechanics with a straight forward strategy for micro and macro, it gives people obvious things to improve, and they can see clear results
2011-03-20T04:46:45  <Stocha> they went and said : let me regret to have applyed ? :p
2011-03-20T04:46:47  <antimatroid> planet wars was an awesome little problem
2011-03-20T04:46:56  <antimatroid> but i personally don't think it made for a great ai game
2011-03-20T04:47:05  <antimatroid> it was awesome to watch as well etc.
2011-03-20T04:47:13  <antimatroid> i just feel it was lacking in the way of decent strategies
2011-03-20T04:47:27  <Stocha> Still it fast to compute state for.
2011-03-20T04:47:30  <Stocha> that's good.
2011-03-20T04:47:40  <Stocha> and you can build a working state transition in a day.
2011-03-20T04:47:45  <Stocha> that's good too.
2011-03-20T04:47:49  <antimatroid> you can do that with the current options
2011-03-20T04:47:54  <antimatroid> i don't see that as necessary
2011-03-20T04:48:08  <Stocha> and you can read the spec on time, and go : mm i think i understand what the game is, and how to implement it :p
2011-03-20T04:48:11  <antimatroid> if you're not willing to spend a bit of time making your bot good, you shouldn't expect to win
2011-03-20T04:48:18  <antimatroid> i want to play around with cooperation in n-player games
2011-03-20T04:48:30  <Stocha> I want to make the bot, not debug the spec of the game :p
2011-03-20T04:48:38  <Stocha> i want them to be crystal clear.
2011-03-20T04:48:48  <antimatroid> they are clear
2011-03-20T04:48:56  <Stocha> that they are not at this point.
2011-03-20T04:49:08  <antimatroid> it's still in development
2011-03-20T04:49:14  <antimatroid> the actual rules are clear, the specs may not be
2011-03-20T04:49:47  <Stocha> but for the fact that ant receive a dir order and cant walk on water. and one food spawn one ant if only one color is nearby and disapear if more than one is nearby
2011-03-20T04:49:52  <Stocha> that is what crystal clear is :)
2011-03-20T04:50:29  <_flag> There's small subtle rules, but the basic rules are fairly clear
2011-03-20T04:50:29  <Stocha> and that if more than one ant occupy a square, all ant in that square disapears; That's clear too.
2011-03-20T04:51:03  <Stocha> there's small unatural hard to compute/ test/ implement ... hard to understand rules.
2011-03-20T04:51:39  <antimatroid> the idea is we want attacks
2011-03-20T04:51:43  <Stocha> but all them are unfinalized also.
2011-03-20T04:51:51  <antimatroid> and your "favourite rule" isn't attacks, it's removing collided ants
2011-03-20T04:51:52  <sigh> well, the only thing in regard to the bots that matters here is battle resolution
2011-03-20T04:52:05  <sigh> which is why it is being discussed now
2011-03-20T04:52:05  <antimatroid> you other proposed method is random
2011-03-20T04:52:10  <antimatroid> which is laughably less clear
2011-03-20T04:52:17  <Stocha> The only thing that matters so far, is exploration, and food gathering
2011-03-20T04:52:27  <antimatroid> no, attacks matter
2011-03-20T04:52:31  <antimatroid> that is how you get points
2011-03-20T04:52:41  <_flag> You have a set of ants, you move them around to find food for more ants, and your ants die if they have more or equal enemies around them than friends. There was some odd aspects of planet wars battle resolution dealing with neutral planets, but that didn't stop anyone from saying "I'll just pick the planet with the smallest number of ships and send 50% of my ships there".
2011-03-20T04:52:41  <Stocha> i doubt that your fighting rules make it that the one that get the exploration and food gathering better won't win.
2011-03-20T04:53:25  <antimatroid> that will be an important component, but not the only one
2011-03-20T04:53:29  <antimatroid> nor do i want it to be
2011-03-20T04:53:31  <_flag> Similarly, if you want to be the best, you have to understand all the intricacies of the game. Otherwise, there's nothing stoping you from making a bot that moves around randomly
2011-03-20T04:54:03  <Stocha> that's what i did so far :p
2011-03-20T04:54:04  <antimatroid> there will be a range of levels of bots for people to compete against
2011-03-20T04:54:08  <Stocha> a bot that moves randomly.
2011-03-20T04:54:24  <antimatroid> but why make the game so simple that anyone willing to put a tiny bit of effort is going to be fairly noisely fighting it out near the top?
2011-03-20T04:54:35  <Stocha> Well i guess, that if i'm right it won't be a real problem after all.
2011-03-20T04:54:44  <antimatroid> ?
2011-03-20T04:54:45  <Stocha> top players will be solving the food gathering thing.
2011-03-20T04:54:58  <Stocha> and stockpiling at borders.
2011-03-20T04:55:00  <antimatroid> i've already got my food gathering algorithm worked out
2011-03-20T04:55:07  <Stocha> that's how every rules end anyway :p
2011-03-20T04:55:12  <antimatroid> that's how boring i think it is
2011-03-20T04:55:14  <_flag> Food gatherthing isn't a problem that takes months to solve on its own
2011-03-20T04:55:35  <Stocha> i have trouble believing it could be optimal in such a few effort :p
2011-03-20T04:55:52  <Stocha> The game is about that, ant life is about that :)
2011-03-20T04:56:12  <antimatroid> find the border of each food square, then paint outwards and find "closest ants" repeatedly moving ties until a player will win
2011-03-20T04:56:26  <Stocha> They have been studied for years, for that. How they find food and bring it back.
2011-03-20T04:56:31  <antimatroid> the only difficult is possibly switching up the order of moving ants to food in order to make sure you gaurantee getting more
2011-03-20T04:56:41  <antimatroid> but that's a little bit of play work, not a whole contests worth
2011-03-20T04:56:43  <Stocha> They have a nice solving of that game too. ants.
2011-03-20T04:57:11  <Stocha> So you have the go to the border problem then.
2011-03-20T04:57:18  <antimatroid> that's easy
2011-03-20T04:57:22  <Stocha> even with simple dieonsamesquare you have that.
2011-03-20T04:57:23  <antimatroid> i paint to find that too
2011-03-20T04:57:33  <antimatroid> or i can store the translate amounts for a border
2011-03-20T04:57:40  <Stocha> you always says you solved it. but i have no evidences of that.
2011-03-20T04:57:57  <antimatroid> it's not completely worked out, but pretty much
2011-03-20T04:58:10  <Stocha> If you solved it in a day then you 'll win or the game is  too simple.
2011-03-20T04:58:16  <antimatroid> i need to go through and implement and iron through a few things, but it's certainly not a contest making problem
2011-03-20T04:58:37  <Stocha> you maybe right
2011-03-20T04:58:51  <Stocha> i have to admit that.
2011-03-20T04:59:17  <Stocha> though i doubt it at this point, it may be that you will be right in the end. but what is the probability of your being right about it i wonder.
2011-03-20T04:59:40  <antimatroid> if you have the enemies>=friends then the best strategy isn't necessarily to fight something as fast as possible, you will want to dance around each other and try to improve your death ratio
2011-03-20T04:59:46  <antimatroid> can you imagine how cool that will look?
2011-03-20T05:00:43  <Stocha> The rule i proposed wall all about enemies>friends ratio.
2011-03-20T05:00:52  <Stocha> although it was statisticall
2011-03-20T05:00:59  <Stocha> it could also be life based.
2011-03-20T05:01:31  <antimatroid> Stocha: are you aware that we've pretty much got a new favourite battle option?
2011-03-20T05:01:32  <Stocha> I still stated that i had this feeling that it was too soon.
2011-03-20T05:01:46  <antimatroid> the one where your ant dies if it has at least as many ants in its battle radius than friends?
2011-03-20T05:01:53  <antimatroid> rather than the power option
2011-03-20T05:02:03  <Stocha> Let's first go with a challenge about solving the simple ant wars game. Then next  challenge you had interesting fighting based on the feed back of 5000 users ?
2011-03-20T05:02:06  <sigh> enemies > friends is implemented as "--attack support" in the engine
2011-03-20T05:02:12  <antimatroid> sigh: with McLeopold's aggreance, i think you could almost make that the new default
2011-03-20T05:02:33  <sigh> meh, I'll make it the new default now
2011-03-20T05:02:40  <antimatroid> easy
2011-03-20T05:02:40  <_flag> sigh: enemies > friends or enemies >= friends?
2011-03-20T05:02:48  <sigh> current >
2011-03-20T05:02:54  <sigh> what is your opinion, _flag
2011-03-20T05:03:02  <antimatroid> sigh: 1vs1 doesn't die then?
2011-03-20T05:03:12  <sigh> 1vs1 does die, 1 vs has no friends
2011-03-20T05:03:16  <sigh> 1v1
2011-03-20T05:03:19  <_flag> Oh
2011-03-20T05:03:22  <_flag> Okay nevermind then
2011-03-20T05:03:27  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-03-20T05:03:30  <antimatroid> leave it at that
2011-03-20T05:03:40  <antimatroid> maybe even make a comment note of that
2011-03-20T05:03:41  <Stocha> is the ant is own friend or not ?
2011-03-20T05:03:48  <Stocha> that should be stated once and for all :p
2011-03-20T05:03:49  <antimatroid> it's not counted
2011-03-20T05:03:57  <antimatroid> he just did
2011-03-20T05:04:04  <Stocha> i used it as own friend in my formulae
2011-03-20T05:04:15  <_flag> sigh: That's better than what we have now because it just leads to people sending in 1 ant at a time
2011-03-20T05:04:21  <Stocha> so one ant always have a friend.
2011-03-20T05:04:41  <antimatroid> Stocha: an ant is not its own friend for calculations
2011-03-20T05:04:44  <Stocha> it allows blocking. But let's say that blocking is not a problem.
2011-03-20T05:04:45  <_flag> If that's what you wanted my opinion on
2011-03-20T05:05:09  <antimatroid> _flag: i don't think it does
2011-03-20T05:05:38  <Stocha> Only way i see with solving blocking is life or statisticall.
2011-03-20T05:05:45  <antimatroid> it gives them a better chance at killing off your one when you have nothing to really lose from going all in, and the scoring makes you want more ants inside the range of the dying ant than enemies
2011-03-20T05:06:00  <antimatroid> i originally thought that too :P
2011-03-20T05:06:14  <antimatroid> well, all in or no in
2011-03-20T05:06:16  <Stocha> and you don't now ?
2011-03-20T05:06:34  <antimatroid> blocking 1 width corridors is fine
2011-03-20T05:06:43  <Stocha> how is it fine ?
2011-03-20T05:06:46  <antimatroid> if it's too much of a problem we'll make the map gens not make them
2011-03-20T05:06:50  <Stocha> and how do you prove it's the only case ?
2011-03-20T05:07:04  <Stocha> you didn't find this case in the first place. So you need some proof don't you ?
2011-03-20T05:07:15  <_flag> antimatroid: are you referring to optionn 1 or 2?
2011-03-20T05:07:16  <Stocha> Even i you did find it, you still need a simple proof.
2011-03-20T05:07:18  <antimatroid> we did find the 1 corridor case
2011-03-20T05:07:27  <antimatroid> _flag: the new option
2011-03-20T05:07:27  <Stocha> and i don't think that such proof will exists :)
2011-03-20T05:07:39  <antimatroid> Stocha: challenge accepted
2011-03-20T05:07:46  <Stocha> okay then :)
2011-03-20T05:07:47  <antimatroid> but i'm busy atm, sometime in the next week or two
2011-03-20T05:07:52  <Stocha> spit there, and shake hand !
2011-03-20T05:08:09  <_flag> antimatroid: I was referring to the current one (which I still have as option 2, I don't know if it's been updated)
2011-03-20T05:08:24  <antimatroid> _flag: it's about to change
2011-03-20T05:08:40  <Stocha> if you make a mathematically acceptable proof that blocking can only happen in one width corridor, i won't give any more arguments about fighting rules !
2011-03-20T05:08:50  <Stocha> we'll need a mathematician though
2011-03-20T05:08:54  <antimatroid> new method is: your ant dies if it has more enemies in range than friends, not counting itself as a friend
2011-03-20T05:09:07  <_flag> Wait, so what's the difference between the new one and option 1?
2011-03-20T05:09:08  <antimatroid> do i count as a mathematician?
2011-03-20T05:09:14  <antimatroid> i'm only an honours student
2011-03-20T05:09:21  <antimatroid> otherwise i'll pass it on to jmcarthur
2011-03-20T05:09:50  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: you're now our resident mathematician :)
2011-03-20T05:09:59  <CIA-33> aichallenge: sigh epsilon * r6f19970 / ants/ants.py : Cleanup code a bit - http://bit.ly/gBoywP

2011-03-20T05:10:01  <Stocha> you certainly not count as your own proof validator :p
2011-03-20T05:10:19  <antimatroid> my friend is a little too keen on actually writing one of those
2011-03-20T05:10:22  <Stocha> you build the proof, and a mathematician check for compleetness
2011-03-20T05:10:25  <sigh> ok, it's now the default attack method
2011-03-20T05:10:27  <antimatroid> from the very bottom up
2011-03-20T05:10:31  <antimatroid> well, almost
2011-03-20T05:10:37  <antimatroid> we'd extend it to set theory later
2011-03-20T05:10:45  <antimatroid> sigh: :)
2011-03-20T05:10:58  <antimatroid> now i have to actually work out how to run this on ubuntu
2011-03-20T05:11:17  <Stocha> There is only limited number of case to study. So it might be possible to build up a program for solving the blocking problem also.
2011-03-20T05:11:46  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@djb180.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-20T05:11:54  <antimatroid> when we have come across rules that allowed blocking
2011-03-20T05:12:00  <antimatroid> they always happened in a fairly obvious way
2011-03-20T05:12:10  <Stocha> wich challenger no doubt will do once the rule is gold.
2011-03-20T05:12:17  <antimatroid> and even then i don't think they would have been easy to do very well
2011-03-20T05:12:27  <Stocha> that i don't argue with.
2011-03-20T05:12:45  <Stocha> only with the fact that there exists some case with blocking.
2011-03-20T05:13:04  <sigh> antimatroid: McLeopold was in support of it earlier, so I don't think he would have a problem with it being default
2011-03-20T05:13:09  <antimatroid> and really, does it matter if people can "make their own walls"
2011-03-20T05:13:21  <antimatroid> people just need to not be stupid enough to walk into such a trap
2011-03-20T05:13:44  <antimatroid> which is really a nice starting point for writing your own emulate state iteration function
2011-03-20T05:13:50  <antimatroid> sigh: neither
2011-03-20T05:13:53  <Stocha> they might have no choice although
2011-03-20T05:13:57  <Stocha> if all ways are blocked
2011-03-20T05:14:02  <Stocha> then they lost i guess
2011-03-20T05:14:09  <antimatroid> it's a single game
2011-03-20T05:14:18  <Stocha> but same goes with any rules. Although blocking might be dynamicall
2011-03-20T05:14:19  <antimatroid> provided it doesn't end up being the same thing happening every game, i think it's all good
2011-03-20T05:14:41  <antimatroid> it's also not trivial to check that you're blocking something
2011-03-20T05:14:50  <Stocha> we might know for quite sure, once the challenge is well under way.
2011-03-20T05:15:10  <Stocha> if blocking is the deciding factor, games may not be fun to watch after a few weeks :p
2011-03-20T05:15:11  <antimatroid> (i'm quite good at saying something is trivial when i want it to be and not otherwise, :P)
2011-03-20T05:15:25  <Stocha> when everyone go straight at blocking point, and the randomness does the rest.
2011-03-20T05:15:36  <antimatroid> yeah, everyone agrees on that being bad i think
2011-03-20T05:15:52  <Stocha> i agree on it being not fun to watch.
2011-03-20T05:15:59  <antimatroid> if that happened we'd almost have to consider changing attack rules, but i really don't think it's possible to block passsages greater than 1
2011-03-20T05:16:04  <Stocha> especially if it happens in the few first days of the challenge
2011-03-20T05:16:06  <antimatroid> and we can eliminate those fairly easily if neede
2011-03-20T05:16:09  <Stocha> and then the game is solved :p
2011-03-20T05:16:21  <Stocha> you can't change the rules once the realy thing start.
2011-03-20T05:16:25  <Stocha> that's the problem.
2011-03-20T05:16:28  <antimatroid> actually, no it's not
2011-03-20T05:16:32  <antimatroid> but it makes for an interesting game
2011-03-20T05:16:38  <antimatroid> if you all block off, then no one gets points
2011-03-20T05:16:48  <antimatroid> two of you unblocking and fighting will get you above everyone else to win
2011-03-20T05:16:55  <CIA-33> aichallenge: sigh epsilon * r452dc87 / ants/ants.py : Stop hard-coding maxx dist in do_attack_closest - http://bit.ly/eNFIWW
2011-03-20T05:16:56  <antimatroid> by interesting i mean weird
2011-03-20T05:17:30  <Stocha> well if blocking is paramount, there is bound to be one or two ant dies in the early stages.
2011-03-20T05:17:32  <antimatroid> the scoring makes it so that you have to be involved in the game
2011-03-20T05:17:35  <antimatroid> not just grow your army
2011-03-20T05:17:37  <Stocha> so that will be the noise.
2011-03-20T05:18:00  <Stocha> you have to be involved in order to grow your army.
2011-03-20T05:18:11  <antimatroid> two players could cooperate and just fight in their zoned up blocked region
2011-03-20T05:18:12  <antimatroid> and win
2011-03-20T05:18:23  <antimatroid> but i really don't expect blocking to be a major component to the game
2011-03-20T05:18:30  <antimatroid> and am willing to design the maps around that
2011-03-20T05:18:49  <Stocha> i don't like the sound of it
2011-03-20T05:18:54  <antimatroid> sound of what?
2011-03-20T05:19:30  <Stocha> next you'll have full ground map in order to have an interesting ai challenge with good combat rules and no blocking :p
2011-03-20T05:19:55  <Stocha> and then blocking might be dynamic
2011-03-20T05:20:02  <Stocha> and easy to achieves
2011-03-20T05:20:09  <antimatroid> dynamic blocking is guess work
2011-03-20T05:20:14  <Stocha> with my bot, (random moving) blocking happens spontaneously
2011-03-20T05:20:14  <antimatroid> which is all part of the game
2011-03-20T05:20:25  <Stocha> well, it's still blocking
2011-03-20T05:20:31  <sigh> dynamic blocking is an interesting ai problem
2011-03-20T05:20:31  <Stocha> if it happens fast, and efficient
2011-03-20T05:20:33  <antimatroid> so is 2vs1 if you look at it like that
2011-03-20T05:20:45  <Stocha> there will be no game other than blocking quick, and having luck at the begining.
2011-03-20T05:20:56  <Stocha> but such is the way of all easy to solved game :p
2011-03-20T05:20:58  <antimatroid> sigh: a..b..a
2011-03-20T05:21:02  <antimatroid> both a's die with the new rule
2011-03-20T05:21:12  <Stocha> it becomes a matter of randomness, because everyone is already optimal.
2011-03-20T05:21:22  <antimatroid> same as with a..b..c
2011-03-20T05:21:24  <sigh> antimatroid: and the b
2011-03-20T05:21:34  <antimatroid> we don't get as much cool cooperation features from this rule
2011-03-20T05:21:57  <antimatroid> i will alas compromise, just realising these defficiencies :)
2011-03-20T05:22:51  <antimatroid> in fact, cooperation is out :(
2011-03-20T05:22:57  <Stocha> just go with life point if you want some combat magic.
2011-03-20T05:23:06  <Stocha> i don't like it, but it seems less weird still.
2011-03-20T05:23:14  <antimatroid> option 1 is the only rule that offers true cooperation
2011-03-20T05:23:16  <antimatroid> in battle
2011-03-20T05:23:31  <antimatroid> so far anyway
2011-03-20T05:23:32  <sigh> option 1 is a bit non-intutive in the results too
2011-03-20T05:23:37  <Stocha> where is the mathematical proof of that ?
2011-03-20T05:23:47  <sigh> wtf?
2011-03-20T05:23:49  <antimatroid> what? a..b..a would intuitively git b dead yeah?
2011-03-20T05:24:14  <Stocha> the proof of it be the only combat rule to make cooperation important
2011-03-20T05:24:33  <antimatroid> cooperation important for battles
2011-03-20T05:24:47  <antimatroid> it's because it's the only rule where an ants death depends on the enemies enemies
2011-03-20T05:24:52  <Stocha> yeah how do you proof that your rules is just that ?
2011-03-20T05:25:04  <antimatroid> because it depends on your enemies enemies :P
2011-03-20T05:25:14  <Stocha> why would that solve it, and be the only way to solves it ?
2011-03-20T05:25:36  <sigh> antimatroid: yes, that case is intuitive... but if the 'a's are more surrounded then it will fail again
2011-03-20T05:25:41  <sigh> which is a bit confusing
2011-03-20T05:26:23  <antimatroid> sigh: yeah it might be a bit, it's certainly less cooperative than 1 was
2011-03-20T05:26:38  <antimatroid> i'm still happy to go for it, as i don't think cooperation would have been that big
2011-03-20T05:27:02  <antimatroid> and i've already got some cool little ideas for cooperation to try generally just from playing around with this

2011-03-20T05:27:57  <sigh> hmm... how about (just throwing out there, not advocating), each ant deals 1/#enemies damage to each enemy, any ant with over 1 damage dies, damage does not accumulate over turns
2011-03-20T05:28:16  <sigh> so if you have more support on either side, the damage is distributed
2011-03-20T05:28:57  <antimatroid> i think that's just the new rule
2011-03-20T05:29:02  <sigh> no, it isn't
2011-03-20T05:29:18  <antimatroid> oh maybe not
2011-03-20T05:29:19  <sigh> a..b..a now kills 'b' but keeps both 'a' alive
2011-03-20T05:29:21  <antimatroid> hmmm, i like it
2011-03-20T05:29:36  <antimatroid> now, can we generalise it to work with integers? :P
2011-03-20T05:29:49  <antimatroid> i think you could, lcm (possible ants in range)
2011-03-20T05:29:59  <antimatroid> or just use rationals
2011-03-20T05:30:04  <sigh> yes, use rationals
2011-03-20T05:30:32  <sigh> I think it is intuitive
2011-03-20T05:30:46  <antimatroid> yeah, i like that
2011-03-20T05:31:05  <sigh> you damage surrounding enemies equally, and your total attack power is always the same
2011-03-20T05:31:25  <sigh> I'm going to implement it
2011-03-20T05:31:27  <antimatroid> and ants heal after battles

2011-03-20T05:31:32  <sigh> yes
2011-03-20T05:32:22  <antimatroid> sigh: it's not option 1 in simple form is it? Oo
2011-03-20T05:32:44  <antimatroid> oh no, it's not
2011-03-20T05:32:50  <sigh> i don't think so
2011-03-20T05:32:52  <antimatroid> it's a lot like it
2011-03-20T05:33:12  <sigh> but it is smoother
2011-03-20T05:33:38  <sigh> option 1 has sharp cut-offs and it is more difficult to understand the rational
2011-03-20T05:33:47  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-20T05:33:59  <sigh> damage is intuitive, I think
2011-03-20T05:34:10  <sigh> I think anyone can understand it
2011-03-20T05:34:44  <antimatroid> we'll get mcleopold to test with his friend
2011-03-20T05:36:52  <antimatroid> the implementation is a lot like 1 yeah?
2011-03-20T05:36:59  <antimatroid> if i'm thinking it through right
2011-03-20T05:37:19  <sigh> hmm... a bit, yeah

2011-03-20T05:57:03  <sigh> and take out the wait stuff
2011-03-20T05:57:20  <sigh> also: #include <signal.h>

2011-03-20T06:00:17  <antimatroid> i'll test, but it's a bit of effort to change, if it's a straight no, what did it do? :P
2011-03-20T06:00:38  <sigh> well yes, SIGCHLD is the signal that tells you when children terminate, you've told the os that you don't care about it
2011-03-20T06:00:48  <antimatroid> ah cool
2011-03-20T06:00:55  <antimatroid> :)
2011-03-20T06:01:22  <sigh> if you want to be fast AND care about it, then instead of SIG_IGN you have a function pointer which is run whenever a child dies
2011-03-20T06:01:47  <antimatroid> i don't need it to be too fast, just not horribly slow
2011-03-20T06:01:53  <antimatroid> and actually work without crashing

2011-03-20T07:37:39  <Stocha> i just tested a food path finding algorithm. Okay it is easy to write. It is also very efficient.
2011-03-20T07:38:19  <Stocha> There is some room for improvement at the moment. But it may well hit a wall pretty soon.
2011-03-20T07:38:51  <Stocha> With food gathering.
2011-03-20T07:39:11  <Stocha> (i posted some picture also, as you might expect now :p )
2011-03-20T07:39:37  <Stocha> I guess i should simply go with more advanced bot, and see where it leads.
2011-03-20T07:39:49  <sigh> Stocha: out of curiosity, what language are you using?
2011-03-20T07:39:53  <Stocha> At wich point exactly combat rules kick in
2011-03-20T07:39:57  <Stocha> i'm doing that in java.
2011-03-20T07:40:12  <sigh> i se
2011-03-20T07:40:15  <sigh> *i see
2011-03-20T07:40:17  <Stocha> i have been around java for years. I'm started to be confortable with it.
2011-03-20T07:40:37  <Stocha> and i'm started to be uncomfortable with anything else also ... :'(
2011-03-20T07:40:53  <Stocha> i guess i'm growing old or something.
2011-03-20T07:41:21  <Stocha> I use C style and a bit of fonctionnal style when i do java.
2011-03-20T07:41:38  <Stocha> only relying to standard java way of writing when it really has no importance.

2011-03-20T07:42:32  <Stocha> while leaving room for quite some bit of optimization
2011-03-20T07:42:57  <Stocha> at the moment, it could easilly mean 30x speed; if i were willing to optimize without refactoring the architecture.
2011-03-20T07:43:05  <antimatroid> Stocha: told you it's not too difficult :P
2011-03-20T07:43:19  <antimatroid> i see it as a fun little side problem
2011-03-20T07:43:24  <Stocha> i guess you where more experimented than me on the subject.
2011-03-20T07:43:49  <Stocha> There is room for improvement. it might hard to do it really efficiently
2011-03-20T07:44:05  <Stocha> but combat will surelly kick in somewhere.
2011-03-20T07:44:19  <Stocha> the trouble is, you can hardly go for combat, if you don't gather food efficiently
2011-03-20T07:44:58  <Stocha> i still think the best bot will have the best food gathering mechanisms at the moment. none of your rule could change that.
2011-03-20T07:46:05  <Stocha> But i agree that you need room for bots to have possibility to gain advantage in the meeting phase.
2011-03-20T07:46:55  <Stocha> one pbot socred a victory !

2011-03-20T07:48:43  <Stocha> what is anonymous function ?
2011-03-20T07:49:25  <sigh> a function that doesn't have a name associated with it
2011-03-20T07:49:41  <sigh> it's a bit hard to have one in a language without first-class functions
2011-03-20T07:50:18  <sigh> ie. a language where functions are just like any other objects which you can assign to variables and so on
2011-03-20T07:50:27  <Stocha> okay, let's say it's too deep into the functionnal way of thinking for me to grab it :p
2011-03-20T07:50:30  <sigh> in java you must wrap it in a class
2011-03-20T07:50:54  <Stocha> i think there are things in java that really tricky (if not impossible) to do.
2011-03-20T07:51:04  <sigh> like?
2011-03-20T07:51:09  <Stocha> still it's practical for most purpose
2011-03-20T07:51:16  <Stocha> like macros for sure :p
2011-03-20T07:51:49  <Stocha> or converting a int[] into a byte[] efficiently. Although there may be some library that i'm not aware of.
2011-03-20T07:52:01  <Stocha> but here i was talking about architecture
2011-03-20T07:52:16  <Stocha> everyone keeps telling me how functionnal style is good at architecturing stuff.
2011-03-20T07:52:34  <sigh> what do you mean by functional?
2011-03-20T07:52:55  <Stocha> where ?
2011-03-20T07:53:18  <sigh> what do you understand "functional style" to be?
2011-03-20T07:53:34  <Stocha> haskell freak late night talk ?
2011-03-20T07:53:59  <sigh> ah, fair enough... yeah, it's really hard to do that in java
2011-03-20T07:54:04  <Stocha> with alcohool
2011-03-20T07:54:42  <sigh> because you need to wrap functions in classes which implement the correct interface and that's a whole lot of boilerplate which gets in the way
2011-03-20T07:54:44  <Stocha> not that i was involved too much with true haskell freaks.
2011-03-20T07:55:00  <Stocha> yeah that's probably that.
2011-03-20T07:55:06  <Stocha> you have to write lot's of junk
2011-03-20T07:55:19  <Stocha> so you would end up with a big pile of crap :p
2011-03-20T07:55:33  <Stocha> all for without accomplishing much.
2011-03-20T07:55:34  <sigh> :)
2011-03-20T07:56:20  <Stocha> Still when you have been around it, java is good for prototyping. And you can do some IHM pretty fast. And then kinda run everywhere. So it is a good one.
2011-03-20T07:56:39  <Stocha> although if you really want speed, you might run into a wall at some point. Without the macros and such.
2011-03-20T07:56:43  <sigh> IHM?
2011-03-20T07:56:52  <Stocha> User interface i thinnk
2011-03-20T07:56:54  <Stocha> UI then ?
2011-03-20T07:57:02  <sigh> yeah, UI
2011-03-20T07:57:19  <sigh> by macros you mean c-type macros, or lisp-type macros?
2011-03-20T07:57:27  <Stocha> I'll walk a bit and find plan for next generation bot i think.
2011-03-20T07:57:34  <Stocha> i know c type.
2011-03-20T07:57:39  <Stocha> i don't heard of list type :p
2011-03-20T07:57:46  <Stocha> lisp
2011-03-20T07:57:55  <Stocha> are they different ?
2011-03-20T07:58:13  <sigh> c macros is essentially search and replace
2011-03-20T07:58:26  <Stocha> yeah that's brutal, but efficient in some cases.
2011-03-20T07:58:33  <sigh> lisp macros treat the code like data and do arbitrary proccessing on them
2011-03-20T07:58:35  <Stocha> we have that in most assembly langage too
2011-03-20T07:58:54  <Stocha> that sound a bit obscure too me at this point :p
2011-03-20T07:59:04  <Stocha> Code is always data.
2011-03-20T07:59:22  <sigh> yes, but not every language allows you to treat it as such
2011-03-20T07:59:30  <Stocha> sure most, won't.

2011-03-20T08:06:41  <Stocha> yes. it also has a lot to do with the fact that java is very comfortable to be comfortable with, whenever you are looking for a job.
2011-03-20T08:06:55  <Stocha> wich tend to happen, once i'm hungry enough :p
2011-03-20T08:08:08  <Stocha> Still java is quite flexible. You can do fast algorithm. And nice architectures. And have access to huges libraries. And run on a lot of platforms effortlessly
2011-03-20T08:08:26  <Stocha> if applet where usable everywhere, it would be something :)
2011-03-20T08:08:49  <Stocha> but most firms block them. So people have to do javascript rather than applets O_o

2011-03-20T14:02:01  <Frontier> boegel: We have an internal deadline as orientation. No heads will roll if it isn't met, but we hope everyone at least tries to meet the deadline. There were a lot of possible improvements over the last contest: Sandboxed source code compiles, games with more than 2 players, viewing replays without accessing the database or the truskill scoring system. In a week we'll probably see if what everyone worked on fits together.
2011-03-20T14:16:04  <McLeopold> antimatroid/jmcarthur: for sigh's rule, it means an ant farther out has a more focused attack.

2011-03-20T19:03:04  <sigh> yeah, what did he mean by that?
2011-03-20T19:03:15  <antimatroid> not sure, they don't really have any more attacking power
2011-03-20T19:03:28  <antimatroid> you can just defend with your ants
2011-03-20T19:03:52  <sigh> I think he means that the further away ants are more likely to focus on one enemy, and thus take it out
2011-03-20T19:04:21  <sigh> but that's similar to option 1?
2011-03-20T19:04:39  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't think that's much different to 1
2011-03-20T19:05:05  <antimatroid> while it's not the same as 1, it's very similar and encourages similar strategies imo

2011-03-20T20:51:04  <sigh> McLeopold: what did you mean by this: "for sigh's rule, it means an ant farther out has a more focused attack."
2011-03-20T20:51:32  <sigh> as in, what point were you trying to make
2011-03-20T20:51:37  <McLeopold> If you have a single ant, you want to make sure your attack only hits 1 enemy.  So you want to stay at the edge of the attack range.
2011-03-20T20:52:10  <McLeopold> In a big battle, ants close to the center are less useful, yet you still need a lot more ants to win.
2011-03-20T20:52:25  <sigh> sure, but were you just making an observation, do you see it as a problem, or something else?
2011-03-20T20:52:27  <McLeopold> It's like the hit point idea, but the healing is instant. :)
2011-03-20T20:52:42  <McLeopold> No, I think this has the most promise right now.
2011-03-20T20:52:57  <sigh> option 1 has the same issues
2011-03-20T20:53:20  <sigh> I think this is similar strategy to option 1, but has the advantage of actually being intuitive
2011-03-20T20:54:16  <amstan> McLeopold: cool how? it's a proprietary language that we must buy..
2011-03-20T20:54:32  <amstan> and i seriously doubt it can be hooked up in our system
2011-03-20T20:54:40  <McLeopold> It's still cool.  There is a student version.
2011-03-20T20:57:42  <McLeopold> It looks like it produces C code?
2011-03-20T20:59:47  <sigh> why don't you just ask the guy if there is a simple, free way to set it up on ubuntu?

2011-03-20T22:19:47  <genericbob> Is there a more effeciant way to mark an area as unseen then looping over every map tile, and then looping over every ant and checking the distance?
2011-03-20T22:20:38  <sigh> you can loop over each ant, and just check mark the surrounding tiles
2011-03-20T22:21:54  <sigh> also, you might want to look at the get_vision function that the engine uses: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L170
2011-03-20T22:22:12  <genericbob> i.e. precalculate the maximum x and y distance from each ant, and then loop through those areas....

2011-03-20T22:40:36  <amstan> McLeopold: pong
2011-03-20T22:40:58  <McLeopold> Frontier was saying you wanted the visualizer.php to be the frame?
2011-03-20T22:41:10  <amstan> no? what where?
2011-03-20T22:41:29  <Frontier> hiho
2011-03-20T22:41:36  <McLeopold> Anyway, we were talking about the appropriate place to but stuff like username and links to profile pages.
2011-03-20T22:41:56  <McLeopold> I'd like to keep profile links out of the replay files, but include usernames
2011-03-20T22:42:22  <McLeopold> I was also thinking the visualizer could have a few text tags around the canvas.

2011-03-20T22:43:40  <McLeopold> Frontier: it might just be easiest to go with the api method.
2011-03-20T22:44:21  <McLeopold> Or, you could infer what the links are depending on the url the replay comes from?
2011-03-20T22:46:50  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah.. no need for links in replay files, a username should suffice
2011-03-20T22:47:03  <amstan> McLeopold: or.. user id?
2011-03-20T22:47:38  <amstan> McLeopold: we used user id in the past to generate the links, but i think we could also do something like http://ai-contest.com/find_user.php?username=amstan&search=Go
2011-03-20T22:48:27  <amstan> McLeopold: maybe change find_user to accept an exact match flag, that way you can just use the previous link to go to the profile directly
2011-03-20T22:49:39  <Frontier> I assume that some people download their replays and would like to see their opponents' names
2011-03-20T22:49:59  <McLeopold> Yes, names in the replay, no id's.
2011-03-20T22:50:09  <amstan> McLeopold: then we can easily modify find_user.php
2011-03-20T22:50:37  <amstan> just watch out for the weird chars as usernames
2011-03-20T22:51:09  <McLeopold> Frontier: for my tcp, if I can set the links, that would be nice.
2011-03-20T22:51:10  <Frontier> ...and optionally have full 'track-back' support, so they can get back to the server where they downloaded the replay from and watch it there or lookup the users. that's what the url in the replay would be nice for.

2011-03-20T22:52:01  <McLeopold> It doesn't hurt to store a little extra info.
2011-03-20T22:53:09  <Frontier> McLeopold: does the engine have the neccesary info available?
2011-03-20T22:53:38  <McLeopold> The engine doesn't.  That info would be tacked on by the system running the engine.

2011-03-20T22:54:10  <McLeopold> The engine should never know about usernames or ids.
2011-03-20T22:54:54  <Frontier> how do I have to imagine this? the engine writes out a replay file and the system running the engine inserts lines about user ids and a back-track url?

2011-03-20T22:59:57  <Frontier> ..."as long as the meaning is clear" means that I have to know at least that i am reading an ants replay, not a planetwars one or tron or a future format. thus a version line should always be up front. :p Why not append the data? I think thats easier on the processor and file system as well
2011-03-20T23:00:31  <Frontier> our last lines atm are <# of players> * s <scores>
2011-03-20T23:00:40  <McLeopold> okay
2011-03-20T23:00:59  <McLeopold> but, for someone just looking at the file, username at the top would be nice
2011-03-20T23:01:18  <Frontier> btw. I'm liberal in accepting any number of blank lines, upper/lower-case and whitespace including tab in between options ^^
2011-03-20T23:01:26  <McLeopold> great
2011-03-20T23:02:07  <McLeopold> what ever is calling the engine wouldn't know the replay version being produced
2011-03-20T23:02:24  <McLeopold> so, a simple append or prepend is out
2011-03-20T23:02:41  <Frontier> oh man this starts to look like html on emails ^^
2011-03-20T23:02:49  <McLeopold> I think username info would be fairly universal, wouldn't it?
2011-03-20T23:04:08  <McLeopold> gotta go, I'm sure whatever you come up with will be fine.
2011-03-20T23:04:11  <Frontier> it is, no doubt. but i would like to introduce some very reduced structure that clearly identifies the replay format. we have arguments over the format every time

2011-03-20T23:08:11  * Frontier thinks: in planetwars there was some kind of wrapper around the actual replay containing meta information.
2011-03-20T23:09:06  <amstan> Frontier: in planetwars there was no replay file, the replay data was in the database
2011-03-20T23:09:08  <Frontier> engine -> replay -> manager adds metadata -> final data ?
2011-03-20T23:09:52  <Frontier> amstan: a zipped binary blob in the db or a file, where is the difference? ;)
2011-03-20T23:10:39  <amstan> Frontier: because the binary blob in planet wars's case did not have any info such as users and so on, it was all fetched from the database by php
2011-03-20T23:11:54  <Frontier> i know, but the php created a single 'file' from that information. it escaped the \n in the replay and had a structure similar to a JSON file.
2011-03-20T23:12:05  <sigh> "binary blob" => binary binary large object?
2011-03-20T23:12:15  <amstan> sigh: huh?
2011-03-20T23:12:20  <Frontier> sigh: lol, you are right
2011-03-20T23:12:32  <amstan> sigh: oh! lol
2011-03-20T23:12:53  <Frontier> i tend to refer to text blobs, too.
2011-03-20T23:12:58  <sigh> :)
2011-03-20T23:13:20  <sigh> there's a reason TEXT and BLOB are different data types :P
2011-03-20T23:14:40  <sigh> btw either way, what is the problem with post-processing the replay file to include player info?
2011-03-20T23:15:37  <Frontier> amstan: I was interested in some container format that survives our endless arguments over replay formats every term ^^, so I thought a simple line with 'v <game name> <version of replay file>' could be the common header and the rest is variable. But now there is the manager trying to add metadata to the replay, not knowing about the actual format
2011-03-20T23:16:11  <sigh> if you are worried about format the engine can output a placeholder
2011-03-20T23:18:17  <Frontier> that's a good idea. could it still mess up replay parsers?
2011-03-20T23:18:26  <sigh> just make the placeholder a comment
2011-03-20T23:20:16  <Frontier> so it would be like "# <metadata>" and the manager places... no wait, player names should probably be each on a single line
2011-03-20T23:20:41  <sigh> it can be replaced by more than one line
2011-03-20T23:21:03  <sigh> all it is doing is giving the manager a safe place to inject data
2011-03-20T23:21:23  <Frontier> but the manager doesn't know about the comment style in use :(
2011-03-20T23:21:35  <Frontier> it could be // or #, allow blocks or not
2011-03-20T23:21:56  <sigh> ah we really expecting this thing to be that general?
2011-03-20T23:22:06  <sigh> *are
2011-03-20T23:23:13  <Frontier> I always expect the worst. Maybe next term someone says '//' comments are better than '#'
2011-03-20T23:23:37  <sigh> I don't think you have to worry about that
2011-03-20T23:23:45  <sigh> if you want it to be that general, then you have to have actual inline placeholders
2011-03-20T23:24:18  <sigh> which brings up even more problems
2011-03-20T23:24:31  <Frontier> or a simple container format
2011-03-20T23:25:16  <sigh> ok, this is getting too complicated
2011-03-20T23:25:20  <Frontier> :(
2011-03-20T23:25:30  <Frontier> i said /simple/
2011-03-20T23:25:35  <sigh> what you want is the manager to be unaware of the replay format
2011-03-20T23:25:40  <Frontier> planet wars had that too
2011-03-20T23:25:57  <Frontier> antimatroid said, the system doesn't know about the format
2011-03-20T23:26:03  <Frontier> sorry, McLeopold
2011-03-20T23:26:10  <sigh> therefore, it should not write anything that cares about the replay format, so it can't even insert data
2011-03-20T23:26:30  <amstan> why do you need to comment extra data that the manager injects?
2011-03-20T23:26:46  <amstan> just inject it at the end, the visualizer should be parsing them
2011-03-20T23:27:39  <sigh> I was just suggesting a comment for the placeholder that the manager would replace with the actual data
2011-03-20T23:27:49  <sigh> since they didn't want to but the data at the end
2011-03-20T23:28:24  <Frontier> It is nice to have the metadata on top when you open the file.
2011-03-20T23:28:30  <amstan> contestbot: topic add Ants is on Reddit: http://goo.gl/NSpYJ

2011-03-20T23:28:42  <Frontier> But I actually prefer the append idea
2011-03-20T23:29:05  <sigh> having the data at the top is nice
2011-03-20T23:29:23  <Frontier> but at the end it can never get in any conflict :)
2011-03-20T23:29:24  <sigh> *shrug*
2011-03-20T23:29:35  <sigh> it can still conflict
2011-03-20T23:29:48  <Frontier> not if the length of the original replay data is known
2011-03-20T23:30:05  <Frontier> waiting for the eof is lame anyway :p
2011-03-20T23:30:05  <sigh> now you are getting complicated again
2011-03-20T23:30:10  <sigh> how is it known
2011-03-20T23:30:17  * amstan points at http://goo.gl/NSpYJ
2011-03-20T23:30:35  <Frontier> the last lines are the scores. they start with 's' and there is exactly one line per player.
2011-03-20T23:30:42  <Frontier> if there is more data, it is the metadata
2011-03-20T23:30:57  <sigh> so now you are back to careing about the replay format
2011-03-20T23:32:25  <Frontier> you asked how the file length is known. and i think the only constraints on the replay format should be a common header for all our games to identify them by and that the length can be computed from the data.
2011-03-20T23:33:08  <Frontier> then the manager can just append whatever it wants without replacing tokens in the file
2011-03-20T23:33:22  <Frontier> isn't that easier for everyone?
2011-03-20T23:33:32  <sigh> ok, if the manager can append, why can't it prepend
2011-03-20T23:34:23  <Frontier> because then you have to put the same constraints on the metadata :)
2011-03-20T23:35:04  <sigh> sure, but now it's at the top
2011-03-20T23:35:34  <Frontier> metadata is generally less important so it shouldn't be a requirement for a visualizer implementation to understand it before it can parse the actual data
2011-03-20T23:36:47  <sigh> fair enough, but if it is easy to ignore it shouldn't be an issue
2011-03-20T23:37:34  <Frontier> ok, lets find a good way to skip the metadata
2011-03-20T23:38:09  <Frontier> "metadata <# of lines following>" would be one way
2011-03-20T23:38:59  <Frontier> (local replays may not even contain metadata and we end up with two possible first lines: the general 'metadata' line or the game specific 'v ants 1' line)
2011-03-20T23:39:58  <sigh> simplest way is to prepend metadata lines with a special character
2011-03-20T23:40:08  <sigh> like "!" so that only one char has to be checked
2011-03-20T23:40:56  <sigh> or even #! so that a naive visualiser would ignore it anyway :)
2011-03-20T23:41:21  <Frontier> that is reserved for runnable script on unix
2011-03-20T23:42:06  <Frontier> #!/bin/bash would make the file executable in the bash shell, #!/bin/python runs a script through python
2011-03-20T23:42:25  <sigh> sure, was just an example
2011-03-20T23:42:33  <sigh> I only added the # as an afterthought
2011-03-20T23:43:26  <sigh> my main point with that second point was that if you want to make it really easy for visualisers to ignore, and the metadata isn't relavent to parsing in anyway, then you can put it in a comment

2011-03-20T23:46:18  <sigh> doesn't really matter, as long as it is easy to ignore the lines
2011-03-20T23:47:18  <Frontier> i understand your point. we would put another simple constraint on replay formats then. comment lines like say '#%' or '##' contain metadata and must not be used for 'real' comments

2011-03-20T23:48:28  <Frontier> the manager can insert them anywhere it likes to
2011-03-20T23:49:22  <sigh> if you always put the metadata at the top, you don't even need to constrain the comments that way as long as it is easy for the metadata parser to figure out where the metadata
2011-03-20T23:50:45  <Frontier> isn't it odd to have all the metadata and then the line that defines the file format ? ^^
2011-03-20T23:50:46  *** Chris_0076 <Chris_0076!~Chris_007@adsl-66-253-173.asm.bellsouth.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2011-03-20T23:51:10  <sigh> nope, because the metadata is not part of the file format
2011-03-20T23:51:22  <Frontier> kk
2011-03-20T23:51:26  <sigh> which is why i think it should not be mixed in the middle
2011-03-20T23:52:24  <amstan> i am confused on why we need this..
2011-03-20T23:52:44  <Frontier> amstan: why did planetwars need metadata?
2011-03-20T23:52:56  <amstan> no.. why we need comments for metadata?
2011-03-20T23:53:02  <amstan> why can't we just append it directly
2011-03-20T23:53:04  <sigh> I think it's fine to just stick the options raw, personally
2011-03-20T23:53:14  <amstan> like that ^
2011-03-20T23:53:16  <amstan> +1
2011-03-20T23:53:36  <sigh> just frontier doesn't want the parser to have to be aware of it
2011-03-20T23:53:42  <sigh> visualiser
2011-03-20T23:53:43  <Frontier> it is a matter of opinion. sigh and McLeopold want the metadata at the top, we want it at the end
2011-03-20T23:54:01  <sigh> oh yes, that's the only thing that I actually want... I think it should be at the top
2011-03-20T23:54:29  <sigh> everything else is just matching it up with concerns that others have :)
2011-03-20T23:54:50  <amstan> top should be preffered, in case the file only partially loads
2011-03-20T23:55:22  <amstan> i just said end because it was a more convenient word at the time
2011-03-20T23:55:36  <sigh> lol?
2011-03-20T23:55:37  <Frontier> *sigh*
2011-03-20T23:55:51  *** zvitamiinz <zvitamiinz!ae718880@gateway/web/freenode/ip.174.113.136.128> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-20T23:56:04  <amstan> i never gave a reason for end... don't just take my word for it if i don't explain why
2011-03-20T23:56:07  <amstan> lol
2011-03-20T23:57:30  <Frontier> amstan: i want the metadata to be different from the replay format because a) local files don't have metadata b) the manager writes the metadata and doesn't know the replay format the engine writes out, so it needs a way to do it without getting in conflict with the actual data.
2011-03-20T23:57:51  <amstan> Frontier: conflict how?
2011-03-20T23:58:06  <amstan> Frontier: local files do have metadata, you have filenames for bots
2011-03-20T23:58:39  <amstan> Frontier: why does manager need to know replay format? all it needs to do is append key-value lines with its metadata
2011-03-20T23:58:42  <Frontier> amstan: I'm thinking into the future. Every term we have a different replay format. Metadata should be placable in a way so that the manager doesn't need to be changed because the replay format changed
2011-03-20T23:59:01  <Frontier> if that was clear ^^
2011-03-20T23:59:10  <amstan> yeah, it was
2011-03-20T23:59:25  <amstan> what about json?
2011-03-20T23:59:35  <sigh> this is a wonderful bikeshed
2011-03-20T23:59:36  <Frontier> json is fine for me
2011-03-20T23:59:37  <amstan> can we use that as a replay format?
2011-03-20T23:59:53  <amstan> sigh: hmm?
2011-03-20T23:59:56  <Frontier> as a replay format? hmm.
