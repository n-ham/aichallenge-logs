2012-07-25T16:42:42  <a1k0n> the website doesn't explain the problem at all
2012-07-25T16:42:54  <a1k0n> it just has a thoroughly confusing video
2012-07-25T16:43:23  <pairofdice> Didn't catch my interest at all
2012-07-25T16:44:46  <a1k0n> so you either need to download a package of unknown type (unknown file extension, even) and unknown size, or sign up for a mailing list, to even find out what the hell this is about
2012-07-25T16:45:01  <a1k0n> it seems like it's probably very interesting!
2012-07-25T16:46:23  <a1k0n> oh there's a scenario.pdf under downloads
2012-07-25T16:47:53  <mcstar> lets see the vid..
2012-07-25T16:48:32  <mcstar> oh, there is no cool music on it
2012-07-25T16:49:19  <mcstar> btw, what does publication mean?
2012-07-25T16:49:50  <mcstar> writing a paper on the algorithm(hah) or putting the source code up for scrutiny?
2012-07-25T16:50:57  <a1k0n> both
2012-07-25T16:51:35  <mcstar> ok, so this is a no-joy academic exercise
