2011-02-03T00:39:38  <antimatroid> amstan_: ^^
2011-02-03T00:39:50  <amstan_> umm
2011-02-03T00:39:54  <amstan_> it's on the forums
2011-02-03T00:40:50  <amstan_> pretty much jbroman coming up with ideas about the contest; more people looking at the repo; some other people playing with ants, trying to convert it to stratego
2011-02-03T00:41:18  <amstan_> oh and me winning my battle against spam
2011-02-03T00:41:25  <amstan_> s/battle/war
2011-02-03T00:41:41  <antimatroid> congrats on beating the spam war
2011-02-03T00:41:46  <antimatroid> reading forum posts atm
2011-02-03T00:45:27  <antimatroid> amstan_: can i suggest a forum poll about games?
2011-02-03T00:45:39  <antimatroid> how hard is it to add options to a poll once it's created?
2011-02-03T00:45:42  <amstan_> antimatroid: you're free to make one
2011-02-03T00:45:59  <amstan_> you can edit it just fine, problem is that each time you change the options, all votes are reset
2011-02-03T00:46:14  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-02-03T00:48:59  <sigh> if you cold just edit without it resetting that would be awesome for trolling

2011-02-03T00:52:27  <antimatroid> i still think my ants game was pretty cool
2011-02-03T00:52:48  <antimatroid> and allowed for simple strategies to be implemented and improved on, as well as plenty of room for variation at the top of the leaderboard
2011-02-03T00:54:04  <pyro-> how did it work?
2011-02-03T00:54:57  <amstan_> antimatroid: which one?
2011-02-03T01:06:32  <antimatroid> amstan: the one that frontier wrote a visualiser for
2011-02-03T01:06:50  <antimatroid> ants had to attack each other, harvest grains and return them to base to spawn new ants and you could invade their base to win
2011-02-03T01:07:06  <antimatroid> and the rules are all fleshed out
2011-02-03T01:07:12  <antimatroid> amtan_*
2011-02-03T01:07:16  <antimatroid> amstan_**
2011-02-03T01:07:46  <amstan_> the issue with that was that it was hard to visualize
2011-02-03T01:07:58  <amstan_> since you had HP for each ant
2011-02-03T01:08:06  <amstan_> and bases had the food stores
2011-02-03T01:08:08  <amstan_> and so on
2011-02-03T01:08:30  <amstan_> also, getting food and returning the base took too long, games are already superlong
2011-02-03T01:08:33  <amstan_> anyway
2011-02-03T01:08:37  <amstan_> i'm out to sleep
2011-02-03T01:09:52  <antimatroid> the visualisation worked quite well for it anyway
2011-02-03T01:10:22  <antimatroid> an alternative to speed it up would be to have harvested grains not need to be returned and deoposited
2011-02-03T01:10:36  <antimatroid> or even just start people with X ants and have grains increase their hp by 1
2011-02-03T01:11:05  <antimatroid> you still have to scout the map out, defend your base, attack them and try to invade them
2011-02-03T01:11:22  <antimatroid> it offers quite a lot to do while it's easy to pick up
2011-02-03T01:11:33  <antimatroid> anyway, night :)

2011-02-03T10:30:42  <Frontier> marek_z: You can of course. You will have to set up some software on your computer and then test your bot against the bots that were released after the contest ended.
2011-02-03T10:31:25  <marek_z> so there's no server still online, but the game engine is available to run locally?
2011-02-03T10:31:37  <Frontier> Actually you can just use the starter pack and replace the bots in it with some of the other bots :)

2011-02-03T13:27:30  <jmcarthur> hey
2011-02-03T13:27:42  <McLeopold> so, our idea does cause blocking
2011-02-03T13:27:48  <McLeopold> even with ties causing deaths
2011-02-03T13:27:50  <McLeopold> xx00
2011-02-03T13:27:57  <jmcarthur> oh?
2011-02-03T13:28:16  <McLeopold> the x on the front has 1 support and 1 enemy.  including himself, it's 2 to 1, so he lives
2011-02-03T13:28:21  <McLeopold> same with the 0 on the front
2011-02-03T13:28:24  <jmcarthur> btw, i noticed that movement is dependent on the ordering of the orders you give the engine. :\
2011-02-03T13:28:36  <McLeopold> yeah, that's my next fix, but it's complicated
2011-02-03T13:28:44  <jmcarthur> yeah, quite complicated
2011-02-03T13:28:58  <jmcarthur> you have to look for cycles and junk. it's basically this crazy graph algorithm...
2011-02-03T13:29:05  <McLeopold> yep
2011-02-03T13:29:12  <jmcarthur> i'm don't really like that
2011-02-03T13:29:15  <jmcarthur> *i don't
2011-02-03T13:29:24  <McLeopold> unless, the bot is allowed to give the ordering
2011-02-03T13:29:40  <McLeopold> then, just use that, and if the bot messes up, it's their fault
2011-02-03T13:29:46  <jmcarthur> yeah...
2011-02-03T13:29:55  <jmcarthur> as long as range is used for combat then that works
2011-02-03T13:30:03  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-03T13:30:08  <antimatroid> i'm about for a minute
2011-02-03T13:30:14  <McLeopold> yeah!
2011-02-03T13:30:16  <jmcarthur> if there's ever a chance that two opposing ants might try to move to the same space, then that rule doesn't work
2011-02-03T13:30:22  <antimatroid> can't you just revert collisions?
2011-02-03T13:30:29  <McLeopold> I thought about that.
2011-02-03T13:30:39  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: then you have to be willing to do that recursively
2011-02-03T13:30:47  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: yes..
2011-02-03T13:31:10  <McLeopold> I figured each bot's ants would move with bumps failing for an individual bot
2011-02-03T13:31:14  <jmcarthur> i'm just saying it gets complicated to reason about
2011-02-03T13:31:19  <antimatroid> is there a view radius atm? or can you see everything?
2011-02-03T13:31:24  <McLeopold> then if opponents occupy the same space, the ants die
2011-02-03T13:31:27  <jmcarthur> atm you can see everything i think
2011-02-03T13:31:35  <jmcarthur> but i think we intend to change that
2011-02-03T13:31:35  <McLeopold> death is the next phase anyway, so it works
2011-02-03T13:31:54  <jmcarthur> i'm going to think about the combat rules a bit more

2011-02-03T13:32:07  <jmcarthur> i find the original rules boring and silly
2011-02-03T13:32:11  <McLeopold> actually, I don't know, I haven't even looked at the bot code or how orders work
2011-02-03T13:32:12  <jmcarthur> but maybe the bodies thing would change that
2011-02-03T13:32:28  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: basically the bots just give orders to the engine one at a time
2011-02-03T13:32:47  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: each bot gives all orders in sequentially before moving on to the next bot
2011-02-03T13:32:52  <jmcarthur> *orders sequentially
2011-02-03T13:33:02  <McLeopold> Okay, so, with 2 ants defeating 1 ant and the 2 survive, we will have blocking happen.  No way around that.
2011-02-03T13:33:46  <antimatroid> are maps symmetric at the start? and is replenishment of resources at least symmetric to starting positions/
2011-02-03T13:33:59  <McLeopold> antimatroid: haven't got that far yet
2011-02-03T13:34:03  <antimatroid> and if so, i think 8 player games could be reasonably symmetric if played on a torus
2011-02-03T13:34:23  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: symmetric at start, plans are currently to go for a "fair but random" distribution of resources, for some definition of "fair"
2011-02-03T13:34:42  <jmcarthur> the randomness is only replenishment
2011-02-03T13:34:57  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: but nothing in stone
2011-02-03T13:35:03  <antimatroid> "fair" i think would have to be from it being symmetric to starting positions
2011-02-03T13:35:11  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: so, do we want blocking walls of ants?

2011-02-03T13:35:22  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: bodies or combat lock?
2011-02-03T13:35:27  <McLeopold> combat lock
2011-02-03T13:35:42  <jmcarthur> if we have bodies i think combat lock is a bad thing
2011-02-03T13:35:53  <jmcarthur> but i'd like combat to have *some* sort of strategy
2011-02-03T13:35:58  <McLeopold> then we have to go with if any ant is nearby, you die
2011-02-03T13:35:59  <jmcarthur> i'm going to consider the issue a bit more
2011-02-03T13:36:06  <McLeopold> which means formations are out
2011-02-03T13:36:07  <antimatroid> an option for colliding friend ants is to merge them into 1 ant
2011-02-03T13:36:12  <antimatroid> and have it considered a stupid move
2011-02-03T13:36:28  <McLeopold> send in lone ants to kill more than one at a time is the best strategy
2011-02-03T13:37:07  <jmcarthur> i started my own engine in an attempt to get a better grasp on some of these ideas
2011-02-03T13:37:16  <jmcarthur> with the same comonadic approach i applied to stratego
2011-02-03T13:37:25  <jmcarthur> hopefully it leads me to something simple

2011-02-03T13:37:26  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm back to bed
2011-02-03T13:37:33  <McLeopold> cya
2011-02-03T13:37:33  <antimatroid> i'll play around with maps in the next few days
2011-02-03T13:38:15  <antimatroid> i'd be interested in having open maze like maps on a torus that are somewhat symmetric
2011-02-03T13:38:25  <McLeopold> yes, that would be fun
2011-02-03T13:39:14  <McLeopold> so if you have a solid mass of ants against another mass, with a distance of 1 counting for death rules, then an ant on the front is facing 3 enemies with 6 support
2011-02-03T13:40:16  <McLeopold> with a distance of 2 (not including corners) it becomes 9 to 4
2011-02-03T13:41:06  <jmcarthur> i'm considering what it might be like to consider the situation of the opponent ants when determining their combative strength against you, somehow
2011-02-03T13:41:21  <McLeopold> if we don't include the ant itself, distance 1, it's 5 to 3
2011-02-03T13:41:24  <jmcarthur> might lead to a complicated graph algorithm if done "right" though
2011-02-03T13:42:36  <McLeopold> maybe help is only orthogonal, but attack is diagonal?
2011-02-03T13:42:45  <McLeopold> then it would be 3 v 3, killing the ant
2011-02-03T13:43:23  <McLeopold> maybe blocking lines of ants is good?
2011-02-03T13:43:26  <jmcarthur> i was thinking what if we counted "support" only for ants in range of your *opponents*
2011-02-03T13:43:31  <McLeopold> and no bodies?
2011-02-03T13:43:50  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-02-03T13:43:57  <jmcarthur> locking might still happen. didn't think enough yet
2011-02-03T13:44:32  <McLeopold> that would work
2011-02-03T13:44:47  <jmcarthur> two solid masses... with distance=1, ant on front is facing three and has.... four support :\
2011-02-03T13:44:53  <jmcarthur> not counting himself
2011-02-03T13:45:01  <McLeopold> and we could still use the ant itself for support
2011-02-03T13:45:08  <jmcarthur> deadlock
2011-02-03T13:45:11  <McLeopold> no, just 3 support
2011-02-03T13:45:27  <jmcarthur> err, right
2011-02-03T13:45:34  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-02-03T13:45:37  <jmcarthur> more complicated here...
2011-02-03T13:45:49  <jmcarthur> the support isn't effective against *all* the enemy ants in this case
2011-02-03T13:45:55  <McLeopold> it's an intersection of friendly ants within 1 of the ant that may die, and that ants enemies in range
2011-02-03T13:45:59  <jmcarthur> some support is effective against some, and some against some others
2011-02-03T13:46:47  <McLeopold> if you've ever played diplomacy, and tried to adjucate a  move, it gets hard.
2011-02-03T13:47:04  <jmcarthur> so what's necessary is to iterate over each enemy ant in range, then count the number of friendlies in range of that enemy...
2011-02-03T13:47:13  <McLeopold> I'd try to stick with totals, and keep the algorithm simple, if possible.
2011-02-03T13:47:29  <McLeopold> if range of that enemy, and the ant in question
2011-02-03T13:47:31  <jmcarthur> and if that number, counting yourself, is < 2, you die
2011-02-03T13:47:49  <jmcarthur> eh
2011-02-03T13:47:54  <jmcarthur> i don't understand my own idea

2011-02-03T15:26:51  <McLeopold> I was "marking" ants as dead, but didn't include the code to remove them.
2011-02-03T15:26:55  <McLeopold> whoops
2011-02-03T15:27:08  <McLeopold> The upside is I now have some unit testing stuff.
2011-02-03T15:27:25  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-02-03T15:28:02  <jmcarthur> honestly, i think it would make more sense to just copy ants to a new AntList as they are determined to survive. that would prevent all this deep copying and weirdness
2011-02-03T15:28:18  <jmcarthur> not even copy. just add them to the new AntList
2011-02-03T15:28:38  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-03T15:28:40  <McLeopold> probably
2011-02-03T15:28:43  <jmcarthur> but whatever. it's a prototype
2011-02-03T15:28:56  <jmcarthur> (hopefully)
2011-02-03T15:29:19  <McLeopold> it looks pretty good, I'm running a large map now
2011-02-03T15:29:24  <McLeopold> but it is a lot slower
2011-02-03T15:29:40  <jmcarthur> there's probably a lot of room for optimization
2011-02-03T15:29:47  <McLeopold> I don't even like the idea of a list of ants
2011-02-03T15:29:53  <jmcarthur> nor do it
2011-02-03T15:29:55  <jmcarthur> *do i
2011-02-03T15:29:58  <McLeopold> I'm thinking it should just be a grid.
2011-02-03T15:30:00  <jmcarthur> there's no point
2011-02-03T15:30:02  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-02-03T15:30:06  <jmcarthur> that's how my code is doing it
2011-02-03T15:30:12  <McLeopold> It's the java programmer in jeff that creates this stuff.
2011-02-03T15:30:38  <jmcarthur> traversing an entire list over and over just to find nearby ants is soooo wasteful
2011-02-03T15:31:18  <jmcarthur> yay for comonads! :D
2011-02-03T15:31:27  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-03T15:33:19  <jmcarthur> comonads are pretty general, but the way i'm using them is:   i have the map with a focus. i can move the focus around and extract the value at the current position. if i define a function (Focus a -> b), then i have a way to transform it into a function (Focus a -> Focus b). and i can transform that into (Map a -> Map b). so basically i just have a way to define the new state of each position in
2011-02-03T15:33:21  <jmcarthur> isolation of all others
2011-02-03T15:33:58  <jmcarthur> in terms of its context
2011-02-03T15:35:04  <jmcarthur> comonad is monad's evil step brother

2011-02-03T15:42:35  <McLeopold> there are a few examples of defensive ants, so it's a little better
2011-02-03T15:42:50  <McLeopold> meaning, you can attempt a better survival rate with formations
2011-02-03T15:43:39  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-03T15:43:58  <jmcarthur> with this particular AI it's a bit hard to follow whether there's much potential strategy here
2011-02-03T15:44:00  <nullkuhl> hello, any one have an idea about rectangle detection algorithms ?
2011-02-03T15:44:13  <jmcarthur> like, *i* think there would be. it's just not well demonstrated by this, i think
2011-02-03T15:44:40  <McLeopold> no, a few contrived scenarios would be needed to demonstrate it
2011-02-03T15:45:05  <McLeopold> But, if the powers that be will accept this rule change, finding useful formations will be part of the fun
2011-02-03T15:45:23  <jmcarthur> yep
2011-02-03T15:45:32  <McLeopold> so,about lists
2011-02-03T15:46:23  <McLeopold> with a sparse map (few ants) looping through the entire map looking for ant might be less time then looping through lists of ants looking for neighbors?
2011-02-03T15:46:56  <jmcarthur> no need to loop through the whole map
2011-02-03T15:47:00  <jmcarthur> just look nearby
2011-02-03T15:47:03  <McLeopold> maybe we could efficiently keep track of both
2011-02-03T15:47:10  <jmcarthur> it could be a dense map, really
2011-02-03T15:47:25  <McLeopold> okay, but for the do_death routine, I need a list of ants to start killing off
2011-02-03T15:47:35  <jmcarthur> data Tile = Water | Land | Body | Ant Player
2011-02-03T15:47:51  <jmcarthur> hmm, should add a Maybe Body to the Ant constructor
2011-02-03T15:48:00  <jmcarthur> but yeah, there's my tile type for a dense map
2011-02-03T15:48:17  <jmcarthur> Array (Word, Word) Tile
2011-02-03T15:48:24  <McLeopold> haskell?
2011-02-03T15:48:25  <jmcarthur> that's my map
2011-02-03T15:48:28  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-03T15:48:48  <McLeopold> haskell is sooo different
2011-02-03T15:48:53  <jmcarthur> data Tile = Water | Land | Body | Ant Player Bool  -- added a Bool for whether an ant is carrying a body
2011-02-03T15:49:20  <McLeopold> what's a word ? 16bit number?
2011-02-03T15:49:38  <jmcarthur> machine dependent. either 32 bit or 64 bit. could go with a Word16 or something though
2011-02-03T15:50:02  <jmcarthur> it's just that the Array type i'm using right now is unboxed already, so it wouldn't pack it anyway
2011-02-03T15:50:05  <jmcarthur> *is boxed already
2011-02-03T15:50:15  <McLeopold> meaning?
2011-02-03T15:50:47  <jmcarthur> well, for reasoning having to do with laziness, we have so-called boxed types. that basically means that it's represented by a thunk. in a collection, that means a level of indirection
2011-02-03T15:50:53  <jmcarthur> so it's an array of pointers
2011-02-03T15:51:19  <jmcarthur> i could go for an unboxed array, but it's a little more work, for the same reason that it's more work in any other language, really
2011-02-03T15:51:36  <jmcarthur> well, at least for complex types
2011-02-03T15:54:05  <jmcarthur> but anyway, the point is that we can just have a dense array and just look around for ants nearby
2011-02-03T15:54:37  <jmcarthur> we could do a prepass over the array to compute an array storing just the number of opponents near each ant
2011-02-03T15:54:39  <McLeopold> haskell's doing all the heaving lifting for you then?
2011-02-03T15:54:56  <jmcarthur> and then look into that array so we don't have to recompute it every time
2011-02-03T15:55:06  <jmcarthur> what heavy lifting are you talking about?
2011-02-03T15:55:21  <jmcarthur> the indirection and such?
2011-02-03T15:55:25  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-02-03T15:55:27  <McLeopold> I guess
2011-02-03T15:55:35  <jmcarthur> yeah, the indirection is kind of an operational detail
2011-02-03T15:55:38  <McLeopold> I'm not use to lazy evaluation
2011-02-03T15:55:48  <jmcarthur> there's a cost model for it, but it's not something you have to worry about directly
2011-02-03T15:56:18  <McLeopold> so, with a 10x10 board, with 2 ants, how do you know where the ants are?
2011-02-03T15:56:24  <jmcarthur> i'm actually going to make the type strict anyway, so i could really just have a packed array if i wanted to bother with that
2011-02-03T15:56:41  <jmcarthur> you would have to make a pass over the board, but only once
2011-02-03T15:56:45  <jmcarthur> not for each ant
2011-02-03T15:57:02  <McLeopold> right, that's what I was talking about when I said loop through the board
2011-02-03T15:57:31  <jmcarthur> ah, i meant for each ant
2011-02-03T15:57:36  <jmcarthur> we're on the same page then
2011-02-03T15:57:39  <McLeopold> okay
2011-02-03T15:57:57  <McLeopold> For a minute, I thought haskell was "really" good at matricies
2011-02-03T15:58:12  <jmcarthur> why wouldn't it be?
2011-02-03T15:58:18  <jmcarthur> i think i don't understand what you mean
2011-02-03T15:58:33  <jmcarthur> in some ways it is. :)
2011-02-03T15:58:42  <McLeopold> Knowing where the ants are without doing a pass over the board.
2011-02-03T15:58:54  <jmcarthur> it can eliminate intermediate arrays and fuse them into tighter loops and stuff, for example
2011-02-03T15:59:09  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-03T15:59:15  <jmcarthur> well, it's not magic ^_^
2011-02-03T16:01:04  <jmcarthur> you could have a separate list of the ant positions as an optimization, but i really think effort would be better spent elsewhere
2011-02-03T16:01:10  <McLeopold> I think maintaining a list of ants, and a matrix, and keeping them in sync, would allow for the best performance
2011-02-03T16:01:26  <jmcarthur> it would
2011-02-03T16:01:56  <McLeopold> If it's a single class, with the proper functions, you don't have to worry about keeping them in sync, you just request changes.
2011-02-03T16:02:16  <jmcarthur> sure. i just mean... i don't think the outer loop is going to be a big deal at all
2011-02-03T16:02:32  <McLeopold> Okay, then we really are on the same page.
2011-02-03T16:02:43  <jmcarthur> so what if i increment a number a couple hundred times too many?
2011-02-03T16:02:58  <McLeopold> overflow?
2011-02-03T16:04:21  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-02-03T16:04:35  <jmcarthur> then use a Word64 or a bignum type of some sort
2011-02-03T16:04:50  <jmcarthur> and that's overkill
2011-02-03T16:05:41  <McLeopold> the pass to calc enemy counts into a matrix is a good idea, that's the memoization I was talking about
2011-02-03T16:06:01  <jmcarthur> as long as we aren't iterating over all ants (or worse, over all positions) for every single ant on every single turn, i'm happy
2011-02-03T16:06:11  <McLeopold> and, maybe a good way to explain the rules to others
2011-02-03T16:06:26  <jmcarthur> yeah it turns it into sort of a heat map
2011-02-03T16:06:59  <McLeopold> you need to iterate over all ants every turn anyway, to determine if they will live
2011-02-03T16:07:19  <jmcarthur> over every turn yes, for every *ant*, no
2011-02-03T16:07:25  <jmcarthur> O(n) vs. O(n^2)
2011-02-03T16:07:43  <jmcarthur> (and it's even worse, currently)
2011-02-03T16:07:51  <jmcarthur> i suspect that right now it's O(n^3)
2011-02-03T16:08:01  <McLeopold> so, which ants do you ignore?  ones not within 2 of an enemy?
2011-02-03T16:08:11  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-02-03T16:08:18  <jmcarthur> i don't have the code for that yet
2011-02-03T16:08:20  <McLeopold> how would you keep track of that?
2011-02-03T16:08:30  <jmcarthur> it's an array. just check nearby positions
2011-02-03T16:08:42  <McLeopold> but then, your iterating
2011-02-03T16:08:47  <jmcarthur> over positions, not over ants
2011-02-03T16:08:52  <jmcarthur> and only near positions
2011-02-03T16:08:58  <McLeopold> what's the difference?
2011-02-03T16:09:07  <jmcarthur> it's a constant, and it's small
2011-02-03T16:09:31  <McLeopold> you lost me
2011-02-03T16:09:39  <McLeopold> an ant is at a position (x,y)
2011-02-03T16:10:00  <jmcarthur> check all positions in radius 2 of (x,y)
2011-02-03T16:10:08  <jmcarthur> that's a constant number of positions
2011-02-03T16:10:15  * Frontier smiles wondering
2011-02-03T16:10:33  <jmcarthur> heh, i could have just written the code in this amount of time :P

2011-02-03T19:52:53  <antimatroid> are ants allowed to stand still on a given move? or do they have to issue a move?
2011-02-03T19:53:11  <antimatroid> if so, then adding in collision reversion adds the ability to do "more" moves

2011-02-03T20:14:02  <McLeopold> antimatroid: what is collision reversion?
2011-02-03T20:14:29  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: if two ants move to the same square the move just fails
2011-02-03T20:14:35  <jmcarthur> i think that is what he means, anyway
2011-02-03T20:15:59  <McLeopold> oh, I was going to kill the ants
2011-02-03T20:16:27  <jmcarthur> IMO that is the most sensible
2011-02-03T20:16:34  <McLeopold> unless they are friendly, then they bumb?
2011-02-03T20:16:36  <McLeopold> bump
2011-02-03T20:16:57  <jmcarthur> it should only be possible if they are friendly unless the combat radius is low, no?
2011-02-03T20:17:39  <McLeopold> yes, and the combat radius is low
2011-02-03T20:18:00  <McLeopold> I could still kill them.
2011-02-03T20:18:06  <McLeopold> It funnier that way.

2011-02-03T20:19:01  <jmcarthur> the way i see it, it's an error to make two of your own ants end up on the same square, so turning that case into a noop is just making things complicated. the question of merging vs. killing isn't really that important, i guess
2011-02-03T20:19:28  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-03T20:21:13  <antimatroid> can't enemy ants be adjacent if they have equal enemy numbers within r?
2011-02-03T20:21:21  <antimatroid> then presumably they can move into the same square
2011-02-03T20:22:01  <antimatroid> also, what order are you processing? are you spawning new ants before or after killing off others?
2011-02-03T20:22:38  <antimatroid> and am i getting it right that if there are 3 opponents, but only 1 on each team all in the same radius section, they all die?
2011-02-03T20:23:00  <antimatroid> would it be better to have it that you die if you have more enemy ants of a particular team within the radius?
2011-02-03T20:27:19  <McLeopold> antimatroid: good questions, I'm trying out different rules to see what makes the game play the best
2011-02-03T20:27:51  <McLeopold> my example games from yesterday lead to the possibility of creating blocking walls of live ants
2011-02-03T20:27:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I know, I'm just trying to get a feel for it myself :)
2011-02-03T20:28:04  <McLeopold> We are now trying a different rule set to prevent that
2011-02-03T20:28:10  <antimatroid> if you allowed ants to kill by walking onto them, you could "bomb" their walls
2011-02-03T20:28:17  <antimatroid> that would be cool
2011-02-03T20:28:17  <McLeopold> I'm still not sure if it is desirable or not
2011-02-03T20:28:36  <McLeopold> good point
2011-02-03T20:28:59  <McLeopold> that may bring back the semi blocking rules then
2011-02-03T20:29:24  <McLeopold> we are working on rules in general where a good formation of ants can survive without losses
2011-02-03T20:29:54  <McLeopold> otherwise, you have suicide ants that can take out multiple ants easily
2011-02-03T20:30:07  <McLeopold> again, not sure what is best, but I'm leaning against the suicide ants
2011-02-03T20:30:25  <antimatroid> so like a glider in game of life?
2011-02-03T20:30:25  <McLeopold> Order processing is move, death, birth, food placement
2011-02-03T20:30:32  <antimatroid> it can roam around without dying?
2011-02-03T20:30:53  <McLeopold> well,not exactly, but it can defend against a lone ant
2011-02-03T20:31:08  <McLeopold> gliders just move, they don't repair
2011-02-03T20:31:15  <antimatroid> that should already be possible?
2011-02-03T20:31:31  <McLeopold> not in jeff's version
2011-02-03T20:31:41  <antimatroid> can ants move diagonally?
2011-02-03T20:33:20  <antimatroid> hmmm crap, you also have to resolve situations like if 2 of player 3's ants and 1 of player 4's ants land on the one square
2011-02-03T20:33:35  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm going out for a while, i'll keep poking around later
2011-02-03T20:34:27  <j3camero> I'm thinking I will crank out an ants/zombies engine this weekend, unless someone has already started/

2011-02-03T20:35:17  <antimatroid> i think it'd be best to flesh that out first
2011-02-03T20:35:22  <j3camero> That is a good thing.
2011-02-03T20:35:25  <antimatroid> can i put in a request for a turn 0 as well?
2011-02-03T20:36:01  <antimatroid> where players are passed game dimensions, number of players etc. and given x amount of time to set up before returning go to actually move onto the first turn
2011-02-03T20:36:19  <j3camero> Yeah I am down.
2011-02-03T20:36:27  <antimatroid> that also gives the java people etc. time for them to set up before anyone receives important information about the game
2011-02-03T20:36:34  <McLeopold> j3camero: nice to see you
2011-02-03T20:36:36  <antimatroid> and people can assign memory etc.
2011-02-03T20:37:31  <antimatroid> j3camero: how do you feel about maps being on a torus (edges wrapped), symmetric other than positioning relative to other players and resource placement being symmetric to everyone's starting positions?
2011-02-03T20:37:34  <McLeopold> j3camero: I've forked the github repo, so you can watch the changes I'm making
2011-02-03T20:38:14  <McLeopold> the engine would need to just wrap around the coordinates
2011-02-03T20:38:36  <McLeopold> If you didn't want a torus, you could just put a barrier around the edge of the map
2011-02-03T20:41:22  <antimatroid> well i'll put a map generator together later
2011-02-03T20:41:37  <j3camero> I do love the toroid maps. Torus is also awesome because then you can create maps without corners.
2011-02-03T20:42:28  <antimatroid> the map gen i'll make will give you large open maze like regions
2011-02-03T20:43:21  <antimatroid> i'm just planning to change the one i made for the other ants game
2011-02-03T20:43:35  <McLeopold> j3camero: I'll work on wrapping the coordinates tonight.
2011-02-03T20:43:59  <McLeopold> I'm also working on performance right now, which means I may ditch your AntList class...
2011-02-03T20:44:09  <antimatroid> and let the number of players vary, then put them along a torus with 2 players on each ring section
2011-02-03T20:44:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: just have an old and new grid
2011-02-03T20:44:48  <antimatroid> i'm a bit iffy about the most efficient way to work out deaths atm
2011-02-03T20:44:53  <antimatroid> i'll play around later if you haven't got it
2011-02-03T20:44:59  <McLeopold> http://imgur.com/2RfZ3
2011-02-03T20:45:30  <antimatroid> my suggestion : make the walls the resource colour, and resources light yellow or green
2011-02-03T20:45:33  <McLeopold> on that game, at the top, you can see red take out a lot of yellow ants without much loss
2011-02-03T20:45:38  <antimatroid> i like the brown floor
2011-02-03T20:46:10  <McLeopold> it's dirt color
2011-02-03T20:46:25  <McLeopold> walls and resources are shades of gray
2011-02-03T20:46:28  <j3camero> McLeopold: awesome. I have to head out now but I'll be hacking all weekend. Hopefully see you here.
2011-02-03T20:46:43  <McLeopold> the map file itself defines the player colors
2011-02-03T20:46:44  <j3camero> Don't worry about ditching my code. I can't believe you're even using it :-)
2011-02-03T20:46:53  <McLeopold> well then...
2011-02-03T20:46:56  <antimatroid> what about no explicit walls? each square has a given height, you can only walk to an adjacent square if the height difference is <= h
2011-02-03T20:47:04  <antimatroid> and you are guaranteed to be able to walk to every square
2011-02-03T20:47:22  <McLeopold> antimatroid, maybe, jmcarthur and I discussed it, but we are trying to keep it simple
2011-02-03T20:47:40  <antimatroid> i really like that way of breaking up a grid
2011-02-03T20:47:51  <antimatroid> anyway, gotta run
2011-02-03T20:48:00  <McLeopold> cya
2011-02-03T20:49:43  <antimatroid> you could totally do something like if you have 3 ants adjacent to one of theirs, it becomes yours
2011-02-03T20:53:33  <jmcarthur> i'm beginning to learn toward simple adjacency rules for combat instead of distance
2011-02-03T20:53:39  <jmcarthur> it would make things sooooo much simpler
2011-02-03T20:54:22  <jmcarthur> or maybe instead of euclidean distance it could be manhattan distance, or even just "within this square"
2011-02-03T20:54:22  <antimatroid> you could go to hp and require attacking, but yeah
2011-02-03T20:54:55  <jmcarthur> straight up adjacency with hp is not what i meant :P
2011-02-03T20:55:32  <jmcarthur> also, requiring adjacency actually mucks up the rules when you consider simultaneous movement. means you have to do weird fusion things when they just move to the same spot instead of allowing them to fight with a square between them
2011-02-03T20:55:47  <jmcarthur> "within a square" seems good to me though, really

2011-02-03T20:56:33  <jmcarthur> i guess distance 1 would still have the same issues as adjacent only
2011-02-03T20:57:01  <jmcarthur> a 5x5 square where you are in the center is probably the easiest
2011-02-03T20:57:22  <jmcarthur> anything within that square is "in range"
2011-02-03T20:59:01  <McLeopold> manhattan distance?
2011-02-03T20:59:30  <jmcarthur> you count horizontal and vertical distance only, not arbitrary angles
2011-02-03T20:59:42  <jmcarthur> that's actually probably harder than euclidean
2011-02-03T20:59:46  <McLeopold> so, diamond patterns
2011-02-03T20:59:53  <jmcarthur> yeah, i guess it would be that
2011-02-03T21:00:34  <McLeopold> the range can be any shape, once we pick it, we can hard code it
2011-02-03T21:01:19  <jmcarthur> well, if we are to have a variable for the size of that shape, then the choice of shape can have a bigger effect on complexity. if we hard code it for the entirety of the contest, then sure, whatever shape doesn't really matter
2011-02-03T21:01:51  <jmcarthur> heh, what if the shape and size was chosen by the engine on a per game basis? :P
2011-02-03T21:01:53  <jmcarthur> that would be crazy
2011-02-03T21:02:14  <McLeopold> I'd say hard code it.  Right now, I'm leaning toward the eight spaces around an ant, which make map generation more fun.
2011-02-03T21:02:26  <jmcarthur> "for this game, your ants will be able to fight in a triangular area"
2011-02-03T21:02:27  <McLeopold> no wondering how to fight over a gap and such
2011-02-03T21:03:04  <jmcarthur> the only issue with the eight spaces one is that you have to have a rule for two opposing ants moving to the same square
2011-02-03T21:03:17  <McLeopold> what if death and  birth rules changed? then you would need real ai
2011-02-03T21:03:23  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-02-03T21:03:26  <McLeopold> they die
2011-02-03T21:03:32  <McLeopold> that's the rule
2011-02-03T21:03:44  <McLeopold> friendlies die too
2011-02-03T21:03:46  <jmcarthur> i guess that's okay, but it kind of sidesteps this other nice combat rule we're coming up with
2011-02-03T21:03:56  <McLeopold> don't piss of you ants by making them attack each other
2011-02-03T21:04:25  <McLeopold> what's the other rule?
2011-02-03T21:04:26  <jmcarthur> i mean if you have two opposing ants with a gap between them then they can kill each other regardless of backup forces
2011-02-03T21:04:55  <jmcarthur> whereas if the range is larger then the backup forces can always work
2011-02-03T21:05:24  <McLeopold> what if they are both backed up?
2011-02-03T21:05:31  <jmcarthur> then they both die anyway
2011-02-03T21:05:40  <jmcarthur> no deadlocking with these rules i think
2011-02-03T21:06:01  <McLeopold> antimatroid mentioned something else earier
2011-02-03T21:06:27  <McLeopold> if we went with the rules that allow blocking walls, you can still order an ant into the wall to kill it
2011-02-03T21:06:34  <jmcarthur> but basically having the collision kills rule with a short range like that means that one ant could kill another even if the other has backup
2011-02-03T21:06:40  <McLeopold> I just didn't have that implemented yet
2011-02-03T21:07:12  <jmcarthur> although i guess that would require some stupidity on part of the bot that has the two ants
2011-02-03T21:07:39  <McLeopold> a collision kill rules helps prevent blocking
2011-02-03T21:07:42  <jmcarthur> maybe it's not as big a deal as i thought
2011-02-03T21:07:59  <jmcarthur> here's another thought on bodies, btw
2011-02-03T21:08:05  *** bhasker <bhasker!~bhasker@nat/yahoo/x-pppvbzsxvlbisuxp> has quit IRC (Quit: bhasker)
2011-02-03T21:08:09  <jmcarthur> there's another way to pick one up... move onto its space
2011-02-03T21:08:20  <jmcarthur> instead of having a separate pickup command requiring you to be adjacent
2011-02-03T21:08:35  <jmcarthur> i guess putting it down still requires something special though...
2011-02-03T21:10:41  <McLeopold> I thought of that too
2011-02-03T21:10:46  <McLeopold> it makes the rules simpler
2011-02-03T21:10:59  <McLeopold> you have ants, you give them direction orders, thats it
2011-02-03T21:11:07  <McLeopold> but, ant can push blocks around
2011-02-03T21:11:19  <jmcarthur> hmm... pushing...
2011-02-03T21:11:28  <jmcarthur> that defeats the purpose of the wall though
2011-02-03T21:11:28  <McLeopold> more collision code
2011-02-03T21:11:44  <McLeopold> not if you have an ant behind it
2011-02-03T21:11:47  <jmcarthur> eh
2011-02-03T21:11:54  <jmcarthur> then you can lock them out entirely
2011-02-03T21:12:12  <jmcarthur> i think i like the pickup behavior
2011-02-03T21:12:14  <McLeopold> yeah, it didn't totally think it through
2011-02-03T21:12:29  <McLeopold> I'm not implementing bodies atm

2011-02-03T21:21:13  <jmcarthur> another reason i think i don't like just having the eight squares around an ant being its attack range is that it means the best possible formation is just a straight line perpendicular to your direction of travel. a moving rectangle or octogon would be just about ideal, and there isn't really much of a counter for it aside from just doing the same thing and killing each other at the same time
2011-02-03T21:21:25  <jmcarthur> it gets a little more complex when the range is larger
2011-02-03T21:22:15  <jmcarthur> hmm, maybe i'm wrong
2011-02-03T21:22:32  <jmcarthur> it occurs to me that for large ranges, thicker-bordered rectangles/octogons would be the ideal
2011-02-03T21:23:04  <jmcarthur> or maybe even just filled in ones
2011-02-03T21:23:41  <jmcarthur> oh cool, you can use barriers in order to force an opponent to break formation
2011-02-03T21:24:00  <jmcarthur> in order to fit somewhere or tear down the barrier
