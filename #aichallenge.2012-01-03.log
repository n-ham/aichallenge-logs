2012-01-03T04:16:26  <antimatroid> and i'm not sure how much variety maps can really have?
2012-01-03T04:16:33  <antimatroid> otherwise it's neat
2012-01-03T04:17:32  <Varan> Hmm yeah i like the idea
2012-01-03T04:17:39  <Varan> I also like the risk idea

2012-01-03T04:19:24  <Varan> I like asteroids because it's different from other types of games ... more arcade like instead of turn based
2012-01-03T04:22:05  <antimatroid> it'll still be turn based
2012-01-03T04:22:32  <aerique> yup, but it looks more "fluid" perhaps
2012-01-03T04:22:51  <antimatroid> i dunno, pw and ants had fairly "fluid" visualisers
2012-01-03T04:22:55  <antimatroid> maybe not so much ants
2012-01-03T04:23:21  <aerique> antimatroid: true, it'll be more planet wars like in the visualization
2012-01-03T04:23:48  <antimatroid> i guess the "grid" will be closer to being continuous
2012-01-03T04:24:04  <aerique> antimatroid: i'm not so sure about the variety either, but it looks like fun nevertheless.  that's why i think it's a good candidate for a shorter challenge
2012-01-03T04:24:18  <aerique> antimatroid: why would it be harder for beginners?
2012-01-03T04:24:30  <Varan> you could make obstacles in the map
2012-01-03T04:25:04  <antimatroid> obstacle might work, you'd need to break hitting asteroids and work out what trajectory they split at or whatever
2012-01-03T04:25:05  <aerique> Varan: yeah, or indestructible asteroids

2012-01-03T04:25:34  <antimatroid> it's not like it's that complicated
2012-01-03T04:25:58  <aerique> ah, right.  at least the battle resolution will be easier :-)
2012-01-03T04:26:18  <antimatroid> how do you determine if a ship is hit?
2012-01-03T04:26:23  <antimatroid> like is the ship really a circle?
2012-01-03T04:27:02  <antimatroid> might be easier to visualise stuff as actual circles? then you could have a rotation line indicating the "forward" direction where bullets would shoot out
2012-01-03T04:27:25  <aerique> currently ships and asteroids are circles
2012-01-03T04:28:02  <aerique> it's just for the looks that i've drawn them differently but i'm also showing the hit circle

2012-01-03T04:29:45  <aerique> Varan: yup, just the location.  i'm not sure whether the velocity vector (or number) should be send to other players
2012-01-03T04:29:52  <aerique> (currently it is)
2012-01-03T04:30:05  <Varan> Because you could maybe also get only a limited view of the field depending on how you are turned
2012-01-03T04:30:27  <antimatroid> i assume asteroids split such that the sum of the new asteroids area's is equal to the original asteroids area?
2012-01-03T04:30:52  <antimatroid> aerique: location? what about direction?
2012-01-03T04:30:59  <antimatroid> and what info do you get about asteroids and bullets?
2012-01-03T04:31:24  <antimatroid> and out of curiousity, how do you determine if two objects have collided?

2012-01-03T04:32:49  <antimatroid> 1v1 with no asteroids would be solvable i imagine
2012-01-03T04:33:08  <aerique> antimatroid: currently the players is send another player's id, x and y coordinates, direction (in radians) and speed (a number which has to be combined with the heading for the x and y velocities)
2012-01-03T04:33:16  <antimatroid> 3d would be more complicated, but visualisation would be harder
2012-01-03T04:33:57  <aerique> antimatroid: collision is stupid at the moment, just a check at the end points.  needs to be improved for the actual challenge but it seems to suffice for my prototype
2012-01-03T04:33:59  <Varan> antimatroid: 3d and 2d dont differ that much in concepts i think ... only in visualization ... and harder math :P

2012-01-03T04:35:45  <Varan> hmm
2012-01-03T04:35:47  <antimatroid> perhaps it'd be a difference game or something

2012-01-03T06:36:39  <UncleVasya> Not carefully.
2012-01-03T06:37:10  <UncleVasya> I was surprised I didn't find there a lot of cool-winning ideas.
2012-01-03T06:37:19  <sashaSochka> yes, I have many half-random constants in my code too, it would much better if I tested them and make them more correct
2012-01-03T06:37:57  <sashaSochka> Yes, but I don't understand even now how he resolves battles with 12+ ants
2012-01-03T06:38:05  <UncleVasya> I don't know about next game.
2012-01-03T06:38:41  <UncleVasya> Yesterday am.stan said he coding asteroids on pyQT but I doubt it is for contest.

2012-01-03T06:39:24  <UncleVasya> There are a lot of talks about communication protocol between bots. Everybody wants it.
2012-01-03T06:39:40  <sashaSochka> It's the same i read on forum )about asteroids)
2012-01-03T06:40:18  <sashaSochka> between bots of different players? what for?
2012-01-03T06:40:47  <UncleVasya> Also I know am.stan was impressed by some aeriques demo on forums. I don't know what it is. Some video on youtube I guess.
2012-01-03T06:41:41  <UncleVasya> To add diplomacy element to the game. Like 'I will do moves A, B and C' if you do 'H, K'.
2012-01-03T06:41:54  <UncleVasya> Or let's attack player 4'.
2012-01-03T06:42:02  <sashaSochka> Just after finishing the contest I read about visualizations with special line commands etc. Did you use them?
2012-01-03T06:42:15  <UncleVasya> no.
2012-01-03T06:42:41  <UncleVasya> The only thing I used for testing is AntsTesting (my gui to playgame.cmd).
2012-01-03T06:42:52  <sashaSochka> I think it can cause mahinations

2012-01-03T06:51:56  <UncleVasya> mcstar: hi. I tried to decrese the size of my code. Not much succes :)  http://codepad.org/yuD18B1n
2012-01-03T06:52:07  <UncleVasya> *decrease
2012-01-03T06:53:27  <sashaSochka> I'm here
2012-01-03T06:53:47  <UncleVasya> sashaSochka: I don't know if there is a post about it on habr. Wait few mins, I'll make an upload.
2012-01-03T06:54:49  <UncleVasya> sashaSochka: Do you have an account on Timus online judge?
2012-01-03T06:55:44  <sashaSochka> No
2012-01-03T06:57:24  <UncleVasya> sashaSochka: http://ompldr.org/vYzE4Zw/AntsTesting_0_5_ñ.7z
2012-01-03T06:58:39  <sashaSochka> very close to that what I've already seen. Have you already shared it somewhere?
2012-01-03T07:00:21  <UncleVasya> On forum but it was very long ago (in June, v0.3).
2012-01-03T07:00:33  <UncleVasya> Also sometimes I put link here.
2012-01-03T07:00:42  <sashaSochka> wow, it's amazing
2012-01-03T07:00:58  <sashaSochka> how much time did you spend making it?
2012-01-03T07:01:07  <UncleVasya> As far as I know there are only 2 users of it except me :)
2012-01-03T07:02:29  <UncleVasya> During beta were 3 but one guy left irc and now lives on forum.
2012-01-03T07:02:29  <sashaSochka> how should I add my own bot to that list of standart bots?
2012-01-03T07:02:29  <UncleVasya> It's hard to calculate because there were very big breaks between developing.
2012-01-03T07:03:33  <UncleVasya> your bots filename must satisfy  mask *Bot*. You can put your bot in any place in Ants directory.
2012-01-03T07:04:04  <UncleVasya> It is written on Delphi, I can give you source code if you are interested.
2012-01-03T07:04:23  <sashaSochka> I don't know delphi
2012-01-03T07:06:19  <sashaSochka> hehe, i can test now all my previous versions of bot at once. thank you
2012-01-03T07:07:17  <UncleVasya> I thought Ibefore  shared it with you already. Pity mistake, I'd like you to have it during contest time.
2012-01-03T07:08:36  <sashaSochka> Yes, me too..
2012-01-03T07:10:02  <UncleVasya> I think there will no need in major changes for the next contest. And I already have a good experience in doing it. So if I'll have a little time, I'll port it to he next challenge
2012-01-03T07:10:58  <sashaSochka> would be fine

2012-01-03T07:23:44  <UncleVasya> was   next_permutation calls find_key, find_key calls swap_and_rev
2012-01-03T07:24:24  <UncleVasya> now  next_permutation calls find_key, find_key returns left, key, right. next_permutation calls swap_and_rev.

2012-01-03T07:35:17  <UncleVasya> ahow984_: hi. The question above is for you too.
2012-01-03T07:35:34  <mcstar> but he is biased now
2012-01-03T07:35:40  <ahow984_> I think the first one looks better, because it's easier to read and shorter
2012-01-03T07:35:42  <mcstar> he heard the answer of sochka
2012-01-03T07:35:51  <ahow984_> mcstar: nahhh :P I gave reasons to justify myself
2012-01-03T07:36:31  <ahow984_> just going to say though, C++ would beat both of them on readability most likely ;)
2012-01-03T07:36:37  <UncleVasya> mcstar: you did it only to help me with size or you like that kind of placing statements?
2012-01-03T07:37:00  <mcstar> i like that formatting
2012-01-03T07:37:04  <mcstar> makes more sense to me
2012-01-03T07:37:10  <mcstar> and i got rid of a lambda
2012-01-03T07:37:20  <mcstar> (fun x -> string_of_int x)
2012-01-03T07:37:25  <ahow984_> do either of them rely on whitespace and indentation?
2012-01-03T07:37:29  <ahow984_> like PY
2012-01-03T07:37:30  <mcstar> this is equivalent to string_of_int
2012-01-03T07:37:46  <mcstar> haskell does, but not like python
2012-01-03T07:38:28  <mcstar> you can delimit haskell too, so it becomes freeform, with {}
2012-01-03T07:38:37  <ahow984_> ah, ok
2012-01-03T07:38:49  <ahow984_> brackets + whitespace ftw
2012-01-03T07:39:31  <mcstar> haskell doesnt care about how much you indent, but you have to be consistent for a given level of indentation, cause another level introduces a new block
2012-01-03T07:39:43  <ahow984_> yeah, ok
2012-01-03T07:40:05  <ahow984_> Is this that algorithim you were talking about yesterday mcstar?
2012-01-03T07:40:21  <mcstar> i dont know
2012-01-03T07:40:25  <mcstar> it was yesterday

2012-01-03T07:53:12  <UncleVasya> Without coding.
2012-01-03T07:53:28  <sashaSochka> i think you should use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem theorem
2012-01-03T07:53:41  <UncleVasya> This is a tricky problem. And funny.
2012-01-03T07:53:44  <UncleVasya> yep.
2012-01-03T07:53:47  <sashaSochka> there are no integers if n>2
2012-01-03T07:53:55  <ahow984_> you should try projecteuler.net
2012-01-03T07:54:27  <UncleVasya> that was a test for mcstar-s mathematic knowledge :)
2012-01-03T07:54:32  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-03T07:55:22  <UncleVasya> btw, I didn't know about that theorem and decided to make brute force. I don't know math :)
2012-01-03T07:55:41  <UncleVasya> Lucky I decided to google this formula before coding just in case
2012-01-03T07:57:50  <mcstar> is it too late to say that i didnt read the link?

2012-01-03T08:02:19  <UncleVasya> 1. I will use Fermat Last Theorem
2012-01-03T08:02:26  <UncleVasya> 2. I will use 3 loops

2012-01-03T08:31:42  <mcstar> no
2012-01-03T08:32:11  <mcstar> because of haskell's purity
2012-01-03T08:34:07  <UncleVasya> hmm, I think I've got Sasha's point about 2 loops. You loop only throw a and b, the c you get when (a^n + b^n) ^ (1/n) returns integer value.
2012-01-03T08:34:23  <mcstar> through
2012-01-03T08:34:26  <sashaSochka> correct
2012-01-03T08:34:32  <UncleVasya> yup
2012-01-03T08:35:05  <mcstar> but its probably faster to loop than to get the nth root
2012-01-03T08:35:17  <mcstar> maybe not
2012-01-03T08:35:36  <mcstar> you dont have to loop over the full range

2012-01-03T08:36:51  <mcstar> or do i need to elaborate
2012-01-03T08:37:43  <sashaSochka> but in  n-th loop you will need to get the n-th root too
2012-01-03T08:37:52  <UncleVasya> I didn't understand but you can not to bother with further explanation.
2012-01-03T08:38:00  <sashaSochka> not root but power**
2012-01-03T08:38:14  <mcstar> UncleVasya: why?
2012-01-03T08:38:26  <mcstar> it is an interesting question
2012-01-03T08:38:43  <UncleVasya> if so, go ahead
2012-01-03T08:38:56  <mcstar> ill check your ocaml code for an example
2012-01-03T08:39:33  <mcstar> ok
2012-01-03T08:39:41  <mcstar> in find_key
2012-01-03T08:39:53  <mcstar> in the first version
2012-01-03T08:40:08  <mcstar> you have several print statements and after that, you return a list
2012-01-03T08:40:32  <mcstar> you cant do that in haskell
2012-01-03T08:40:47  <mcstar> that print statement is a side-effect
2012-01-03T08:41:05  <mcstar> it affects the outside worl(otside wrt the function)
2012-01-03T08:41:13  <UncleVasya> Understood.
2012-01-03T08:41:34  <mcstar> so every pure haskell code is like nesting
2012-01-03T08:41:41  <mcstar> you nest function until you get bored
2012-01-03T08:41:44  <mcstar> s
2012-01-03T08:42:18  <mcstar> but you can have several monads, in these monads you can have a sequential program
2012-01-03T08:42:34  <mcstar> executing pure or un-pure code one after another
2012-01-03T08:42:56  <mcstar> and the return values are not necessarily the input values of another function
2012-01-03T08:43:37  <mcstar> but that function, that uses this IO monad(one of several monads) must have a different type signature than a pure function
2012-01-03T08:44:10  <mcstar> so if i had to debug that code with print statements id need to write the whole thing in a monad
2012-01-03T08:44:25  <mcstar> the main function in my code is un-pre
2012-01-03T08:44:26  <mcstar> pure
2012-01-03T08:44:46  <mcstar> "do" introduces the un-pure part
2012-01-03T08:45:02  <mcstar> so this is my short answer
2012-01-03T08:45:25  <mcstar> i dont have any idea yet, how to debug in haskell with prints "comfortably"
2012-01-03T08:46:48  <UncleVasya> I was lucky to avoid haskell in contest :)
2012-01-03T08:48:41  <UncleVasya> why you decided to code next_permutation?
2012-01-03T08:50:34  <mcstar> ok, for the last time
2012-01-03T08:50:58  <mcstar> there was rwest's problem, i did it in haskell, was slow, and had a recursive permutation function
2012-01-03T08:51:10  <mcstar> after that i did a mucgh better version in c++
2012-01-03T08:51:16  <mcstar> but it used the next_perm funciton
2012-01-03T08:51:23  <mcstar> and i wanted to do the same in haskell
2012-01-03T08:51:28  <mcstar> thats the whole story
2012-01-03T08:52:25  <mcstar> (it wasnt slow because of the permutation funtion, but for a whole different reason, i sed a recursive graph-walker in it, but with c++ mutable arrays i could do a waaay faster one)
2012-01-03T09:03:38  <UncleVasya> maybe we can ask on some haskell, ocaml or f_prog channel to show us a nice solution?

2012-01-03T09:42:47  <ahow984_> how can I tell if I've an integer overflow with gdb?
2012-01-03T09:44:01  <mcstar> Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
2012-01-03T09:46:07  <mcstar> try adding an assert or something, if your new value is less than the original, you had an overflow
2012-01-03T09:46:16  <mcstar> (if you only increase the said variable)
2012-01-03T09:46:36  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-03T09:46:36  <mcstar> (i have no idea about gdb)

2012-01-03T14:33:24  <antimatroid> i assume that problem had some kind of dp solution?
2012-01-03T14:34:57  <rwest> antimatroid: it's basically just a bunch of optimizations that you end up doing incrementally
2012-01-03T14:35:11  <rwest> my solution missed 1 optimization that mcstar had
2012-01-03T14:35:31  <rwest> reducing the graph every time you go down a path
2012-01-03T14:35:37  <rwest> I calculated the whole thing out
2012-01-03T14:35:41  <rwest> and it was slow as shit hah
2012-01-03T14:35:45  <antimatroid> hehe
2012-01-03T14:35:52  <rwest> I used incidence matrices too
2012-01-03T14:36:00  <rwest> and I just couldn't get it faster
2012-01-03T14:36:12  <rwest> 3300x3300 matrix math is slow
2012-01-03T14:37:06  <antimatroid> incidence matrices are alow unless your graph is near complete?

2012-01-03T14:40:42  <mcstar> was that serious?
2012-01-03T14:40:43  <antimatroid> that is all ridiculous
2012-01-03T14:40:45  <antimatroid> i think so
2012-01-03T14:46:48  <mcstar> rwest: id read the file in 2 medium sized arrays, like 60 characters each, and search for the "truth" in them, if found, i could re-create the context without moving the file pointer
2012-01-03T14:47:09  <mcstar> first thought
2012-01-03T14:48:09  <mcstar> actually i dont know
2012-01-03T14:48:13  <mcstar> it isnt necessary
2012-01-03T14:50:06  <mcstar> rwest: how efficient was your solution?
2012-01-03T14:52:01  <rwest> mcstar: instant, only read the file once
2012-01-03T14:52:21  <mcstar> but do you store the whole file in memory?
2012-01-03T14:52:26  <rwest> yes
2012-01-03T14:52:31  <mcstar> oh
2012-01-03T14:52:34  <rwest> and I index every word
2012-01-03T14:52:39  <mcstar> i wanted to do it wo that
2012-01-03T14:53:37  <rwest> I basically have a PHP class called index
2012-01-03T14:53:48  <rwest> that will take a file and index the entire thing
2012-01-03T14:54:03  <rwest> then I can search it and return the given context

2012-01-03T16:27:21  <McLeopold> amstan: python should be 4 spaces no tabs
2012-01-03T16:27:36  <amstan> they suggest 3 spaces actually..
2012-01-03T16:27:50  <McLeopold> nope, 4
2012-01-03T16:28:10  <McLeopold> http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
2012-01-03T16:28:18  <amstan> i remember 3 from somewhere
2012-01-03T16:28:35  <McLeopold> it's arbitrary, but that's the way it is
2012-01-03T16:28:54  <McLeopold> just make sure you have an editor that will do the work for you
2012-01-03T16:29:09  <ahow984_> set tabstop=4
2012-01-03T16:29:10  <ahow984_> ;)
2012-01-03T16:29:29  <ronchaine>  I got that 3 spaces from somewhere too.
2012-01-03T16:29:35  <ronchaine> Don't remember where, though.
2012-01-03T16:37:11  <McLeopold> amstan: reST files use 3 spaces...

2012-01-03T16:47:53  <McLeopold> just the code
2012-01-03T16:49:30  <McLeopold> I don't like your use of a global "scene" variable that is referenced by a class
2012-01-03T16:52:40  <amstan> the alternative was using arguments for everything and i didn't want to bother
2012-01-03T16:53:04  <amstan> it's a prototype, so close enough
2012-01-03T16:53:20  <McLeopold> at least it's just a prototype, as long as you throw the code away :)
2012-01-03T16:54:34  <McLeopold> how is app tied in?
2012-01-03T16:55:38  <amstan> what?
2012-01-03T16:55:51  <McLeopold> line 169
2012-01-03T16:56:09  <McLeopold> I don't see how app and main are connected, unless it is QT magic?
2012-01-03T16:56:18  <amstan> it's a qt thing
2012-01-03T16:57:07  <amstan> yeah, it won't let you init any qwidgets unless you have a qapplication running

2012-01-03T22:36:06  <amstan> yeah
2012-01-03T22:36:25  <janzert> and actually when I looked at it some more, it's hitting ants.aichallenge.org and tron.aichallenge.org
2012-01-03T22:36:45  <janzert> of course from its perspective it probably considers them separate servers

2012-01-03T22:38:12  <amstan> it stops from time to time
2012-01-03T22:38:43  <janzert> maybe it finally gets the idea from the response times that it's overloading the server
2012-01-03T22:38:51  <janzert> I know google has something like that
2012-01-03T22:39:31  <amstan> if shouldn't index games at all
2012-01-03T22:39:36  <amstan> so we should disallow them
2012-01-03T22:39:53  <amstan> janzert: about the non profit what do you think we should do?
2012-01-03T22:39:58  <janzert> yeah, I'm not sure what useful information it could get from a game page
2012-01-03T22:40:16  <janzert> the only option I know is to keep kicking Jeff about it
2012-01-03T22:40:34  <janzert> he can even just agree to step aside I think

2012-01-03T22:41:38  <janzert> well right at the moment I'm not in the mood to push anything either

2012-01-03T22:43:24  <amstan> lol
2012-01-03T22:43:29  <janzert> although not quite as bad as planetwars
2012-01-03T22:43:47  <janzert> 2 months instead of 3 helped with that I think :)
2012-01-03T22:44:03  <amstan> i'm sure we can automate a lot of these things related to launching/closing
2012-01-03T22:44:51  <janzert> eh, it's more the months of keeping everything together I think
2012-01-03T22:45:07  <amstan> the bugs?
2012-01-03T22:45:18  <pairofdice> Maybe why Ludum Dare is only 48hours ;)
2012-01-03T22:46:24  <janzert> just general stress of the contest mostly I think
