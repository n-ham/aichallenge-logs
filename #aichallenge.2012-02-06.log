2012-02-06T07:16:41  <mleise> Thought it was just some island disconnected from the rest of the world :D
2012-02-06T07:16:46  <mcstar> i was surprised delt0r didnt compete
2012-02-06T07:17:08  <mleise> neither did I, wait ... I fought JavaScript
2012-02-06T07:18:54  * mcstar remembers telling delt0r to rather build his bot than replicating the engine, he would have written a decent bot i that time
2012-02-06T07:20:57  <mleise> one day I will finish that path finding routine
2012-02-06T07:21:22  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-06T07:21:33  <mcstar> what do you mean, finish it?
2012-02-06T07:22:04  <mleise> Just write the module that handles path finding to a state where it is usable
2012-02-06T07:22:23  <mleise> like adding newly dicovered tiles to it, make it update the internal data structure etc.
2012-02-06T07:22:42  <delt0r> mcstar: i had a bot
2012-02-06T07:22:52  <delt0r> but then i needed to still add combat
2012-02-06T07:23:02  <mcstar> did you submit?

2012-02-06T07:24:24  <mcstar> 180th
2012-02-06T07:24:29  <delt0r> not bad
2012-02-06T07:24:32  <mleise> well well
2012-02-06T07:25:06  <mcstar> i thought i had a chance to be in the top100
2012-02-06T07:25:08  <mleise> you know... if i had that path finder done, it could have moved ants in packs
2012-02-06T07:25:09  <delt0r> i was not surprised by the winning bot methodology... was close to mine
2012-02-06T07:25:26  <mleise> and make ants from everywhere arrive at a time
2012-02-06T07:25:36  <mcstar> my bot was a mess, ill learn from my mistakes
2012-02-06T07:25:47  <mleise> you can still battle Accoun on tcp
2012-02-06T07:25:49  <delt0r> my goal -had i entered --was the top 100
2012-02-06T07:25:51  <delt0r> lol
2012-02-06T07:25:59  <delt0r> how did Accoun do?
2012-02-06T07:26:04  <mcstar> didnt submit
2012-02-06T07:26:07  <delt0r> did we all cheat him again?
2012-02-06T07:26:13  <mleise> he doesnt like canadians
2012-02-06T07:26:30  <mleise> lol, i don't know. he preferred to play on tcp only
2012-02-06T07:26:52  <delt0r> probably because we are all cheating otherwise
2012-02-06T07:27:07  <delt0r> any word on the next comp?
2012-02-06T07:27:25  <mleise> I was asked to do a visualizer
2012-02-06T07:27:25  <mcstar> they said delt0r will figure it out

2012-02-06T07:27:53  <delt0r> ?? ok i am now confused --what?
2012-02-06T07:28:07  <pairofdice> :>
2012-02-06T07:28:36  <mleise> delt0r: my pathfinder is better than anything existing ... i mean would have been. it fits into CPU L1 cache and is super fast
2012-02-06T07:28:53  <mcstar> pathfinding has little to do with challenge i believe, it was a necessity, but thats all
2012-02-06T07:29:00  <mleise> So the idea was a space dog fighting games with asteroids
2012-02-06T07:29:08  <delt0r> mleise: My one was finished :D
2012-02-06T07:29:28  <delt0r> mleise: really?

2012-02-06T07:29:34  <delt0r> i already have code

2012-02-06T07:30:33  <delt0r> i started a space squad combat thing for the aichallenge last time
2012-02-06T07:30:53  <delt0r> but then everyone got the hots for ants in their pants and i never finished it
2012-02-06T07:31:17  <delt0r> I managed to make it 100% integer and stuff
2012-02-06T07:31:34  <delt0r> so the engine and basic game spec was sorta done

2012-02-06T07:35:10  <mcstar> sure
2012-02-06T07:35:15  <mleise> It uses several optimizations and needs a sophisticated algorithm to build the data structures

2012-02-06T07:35:34  <mleise> try to make sense of it
2012-02-06T07:35:41  <mcstar> why not?
2012-02-06T07:35:59  <mleise> because it isn't finished and will not tell you the truth
2012-02-06T07:36:01  <mcstar> i didnt want to see it for its syntax highliting

2012-02-06T07:36:32  <mcstar> what is the alg. that you implemented?
2012-02-06T07:36:46  <mleise> ?
2012-02-06T07:36:56  <mleise> something homegrown.
2012-02-06T07:36:57  <mcstar> is it a known one?
2012-02-06T07:37:00  <mcstar> ok
2012-02-06T07:37:09  <mleise> at least I haven't found it on the net
2012-02-06T07:37:11  <mcstar> where can it pathfind?

2012-02-06T07:37:25  <mleise> it works only on the situation in ant
2012-02-06T07:37:33  <thestinger> mleise: you were dividing up the map into 'rooms' basically, right? I barely remember :)
2012-02-06T07:37:35  <mleise> so: 4 directions on a grid
2012-02-06T07:37:50  <mleise> right, rooms or portals
2012-02-06T07:37:58  <mcstar> mleise: so a square lattice, with obstacles
2012-02-06T07:38:24  <mleise> mcstar: yes, the portals can be anywhere
2012-02-06T07:38:39  <mcstar> delt0r: think nothing of it, i just expressed that i was surpried by it
2012-02-06T07:38:46  <mleise> they form convex areas without obstacles
2012-02-06T07:38:46  <delt0r> right
2012-02-06T07:39:14  <delt0r> mcstar: it seems like a great idea... need a particular structure however --but one we often have
2012-02-06T07:39:16  <mleise> that's something you already see implemented though

2012-02-06T07:40:15  <mleise> The biggest gain was skipping dead ends and dividing the map into portals to reduce the number of queries
2012-02-06T07:40:58  <thestinger> I have a newfound hatred for C++ now thanks to boost spirit
2012-02-06T07:41:27  <mleise> It means that a long path consists of maybe 8 segments only and is not laid down in detail yet, only the protals that will be used are known
2012-02-06T07:42:14  <mleise> by the nature of the ants maps, most areas only have one ore two more portals
2012-02-06T07:42:40  <mleise> this is different from A* as well, where you mostly have 3 degrees of freedom
2012-02-06T07:43:00  <mcstar> alias std.stdio.stdout.writefln wfln; useful alias
2012-02-06T07:43:05  <mleise> so the search tree it is both shorter and less spread out
2012-02-06T07:43:22  <mleise> mcstar: oh yeah, that one ;)
2012-02-06T07:43:46  <mcstar> mleise: do you know about waypoint-maps?
2012-02-06T07:43:53  <mcstar> graphs, sorry
2012-02-06T07:44:16  <mleise> mcstar: I think so
2012-02-06T07:44:17  <mcstar> anyway, the idea to find a coarse path, and then refine it isnt new
2012-02-06T07:44:48  <mcstar> is that what you do?
2012-02-06T07:45:12  <mcstar> you build up a graps of these portals right?
2012-02-06T07:45:15  <mcstar> -s
2012-02-06T07:45:23  <mleise> I do that ... and to be honest I see no other way to speed the search up
2012-02-06T07:45:26  <mcstar> can you guarantee optimality?
2012-02-06T07:46:14  <mleise> mcstar: yes, i build up graphs of portals and can guarantee optimality, by knowing the positions of the portals and calculating the minimum distance from where I am to where I pass the portal
2012-02-06T07:47:11  <mleise> and dead ends are skipped alltogether, making it especially fast on the maze maps with all the random noise on the walls
2012-02-06T07:48:02  <mleise> I *really* have to finish that thing. I think it is new and awesome.
2012-02-06T07:48:02  <mcstar> what is the separation condition?
2012-02-06T07:48:12  <mleise> what is that?
2012-02-06T07:48:33  <mcstar> when you consider some area consisting of 2,3... portals?
2012-02-06T07:48:48  <mcstar> how do you spearate portals
2012-02-06T07:48:55  <mleise> A*
2012-02-06T07:48:56  <mcstar> lets say you see a dead end
2012-02-06T07:49:13  <mcstar> you have to close that dead end off
2012-02-06T07:49:18  <mcstar> where is the Frontier?
2012-02-06T07:49:24  <mleise> lol
2012-02-06T07:49:26  <mcstar> (pun intended)
2012-02-06T07:50:03  <mleise> you can imagine it like moving a huge wedge against the silhouette of an ostacle
2012-02-06T07:50:18  <mleise> the squares it can't reach are a dead end
2012-02-06T07:51:01  <mleise> if you move inside there, your path gets longer (unless the target is in the dead end)
2012-02-06T07:51:03  <antimatroid1> woah, non-silence!
2012-02-06T07:51:15  <mcstar> dont scream

2012-02-06T07:51:46  <mleise> I call it Pfadfinder for now
2012-02-06T07:52:22  <antimatroid1> have any of you played with the maximum path problem from tron?
2012-02-06T07:52:29  <mleise> mcstar: anyway, I don't recall in all detail how the dead-end detection was supposed to work. I had to reiterate over that again and again
2012-02-06T07:52:35  <pairofdice> Mmm, teenage girl simulator

2012-02-06T07:54:58  <mleise> To finish my talk: I finally found that I have to let the portals cut through each other, essentially creating small rectangular areas - some of them with obstacles on the sides/in the corners
2012-02-06T07:56:04  <mcstar> omg, portals never overlap!!!!
2012-02-06T07:56:05  <mleise> Then when you navigate the portals there are some top secret optimizations that filter some of the options, so you don't end up where you started
2012-02-06T07:56:18  <mcstar> you might create an interdimensional passthrought
2012-02-06T07:56:26  <mcstar> where matter converts to antimatter
2012-02-06T07:56:33  <mcstar> and eats up the known universe!
2012-02-06T07:56:34  <mleise> uhm

2012-02-06T08:03:38  <mleise> oh right... one moment
2012-02-06T08:05:36  <mcstar> unbelievable
2012-02-06T08:05:51  <mcstar> my numerical libraries all die on my

2012-02-06T08:07:15  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-06T08:07:23  <mcstar> so
2012-02-06T08:07:28  <mcstar> explanations?
2012-02-06T08:07:43  <mcstar> black is land right?
2012-02-06T08:07:48  <mleise> didn't i give all the explanations already?
2012-02-06T08:07:59  <mleise> black is wa... yes land -.-
2012-02-06T08:08:36  <mleise> as you can see all the small compartments are convex (in manhatten metric)
2012-02-06T08:09:05  <mleise> so you can never be stuck with you ant, moving from one portal to the next!
2012-02-06T08:09:39  <mleise> that's what makes this part both fast and we know the cost
2012-02-06T08:10:25  <delt0r> So what are the chances it will be Asteroids next?
2012-02-06T08:11:29  <mleise> I don't know delt0r. I said I wouldn't do the visualizer and that's it. Is there no forum thread with ideas for the next game?
2012-02-06T08:13:27  <mleise> The portals can be described in three bytes, so the whole path finding data should fit into CPU L1 cache, which should be way faster than allocating little nodes and connecting them through pointers
2012-02-06T08:14:12  <mleise> Anyway I'm just keeping the channel busy
2012-02-06T08:14:33  <mcstar> i guess the cache size is constant on most machines...
2012-02-06T08:16:15  <mleise> mcstar: 64KB at least I'd say
2012-02-06T08:16:34  <mleise> that is what I have in my notebook
2012-02-06T08:16:58  <mcstar> i mean there will be a problem size that wont fit into the cash
2012-02-06T08:17:11  <mcstar> anyway, you dont really have control of the cache
2012-02-06T08:18:23  <mcstar> when you are ready, ill be interested in a speed comparison against some fast bfs implementation
2012-02-06T08:18:43  <mleise> mcstar: a 256x256 map will most likely fit into the cache. I just count on that.
2012-02-06T08:19:19  <mleise> I had some rough numbers for portals on some maps
2012-02-06T08:19:45  <mleise> but it is difficult to update the map with each discovered square
2012-02-06T08:20:28  <mleise> portals need to be created/removed, the "slices" where portals cut each other need to be updated, dead ends added...
2012-02-06T08:21:13  <mleise> you know how long the code already is

2012-02-06T08:21:30  <mleise> I must find a simpler method
2012-02-06T08:23:03  <mcstar> just use a more conscise language
2012-02-06T08:23:10  <mcstar> preferably a functional one
2012-02-06T08:23:55  <UncleVasya> like OCaml!
2012-02-06T08:24:36  <mleise> mcstar: that is the problem: I don't speak functional
2012-02-06T08:24:49  <mleise> I used to learn Delphi, Java, Basic and so on
2012-02-06T08:25:13  <delt0r> mleise: well i would do a java one... but a js one? well i haven't touched js since like 2003 or so
2012-02-06T08:25:15  <pairofdice> Me no speak functional
2012-02-06T08:25:28  <mcstar> mleise: if you are a optimizing speed freak, probably imperative languages will fit you better
2012-02-06T08:25:28  <mleise> It is not like D doesn't support functional style, but I don't know how to make use of it
2012-02-06T08:25:57  <mleise> delt0r: who said JS?
2012-02-06T08:26:36  <delt0r> well the last one was in JS and it worked pretty well IMO
2012-02-06T08:26:50  <delt0r> applets are crap

2012-02-06T08:27:56  <delt0r> mleise: yea
2012-02-06T08:28:25  <mleise> you can try some language that converts to JS
2012-02-06T08:28:33  <delt0r> fark that
2012-02-06T08:28:53  <delt0r> if i am going to do a js one... i will do a js one
2012-02-06T08:29:08  <mcstar> what?
2012-02-06T08:29:09  <delt0r> otherwise i just make it someone elses problem
2012-02-06T08:29:18  <mcstar> does that mean you will write the asteroids visualizer?
2012-02-06T08:29:35  <delt0r> do a java one... let the resident node.js guru do the rest

2012-02-06T08:30:50  <mcstar> i just would like a better game idea though
2012-02-06T08:30:53  <delt0r> but its just that... from the thread i get the idea that its not meant to become the final version...
2012-02-06T08:31:16  <delt0r> unless of course it does become the production version... these things do tend to happen
2012-02-06T08:31:31  <delt0r> mcstar: for example?
2012-02-06T08:31:45  <delt0r> my orginal idea was "space squad"
2012-02-06T08:31:46  <mcstar> yes
2012-02-06T08:31:53  <mcstar> i dont have any ideas

2012-02-06T08:33:09  <mcstar> and aichallenge felt sort of like an excuse from them
2012-02-06T08:33:18  <delt0r> i was going to solve world hunger... but then i decided to go skiing instead :/
2012-02-06T08:33:26  <mcstar> :D
2012-02-06T08:33:42  <mcstar> im in for solving world energy crisis
2012-02-06T08:33:51  <delt0r> next up... fusion... Always wanted to build a fusion reactor
2012-02-06T08:33:57  <mcstar> ah right
2012-02-06T08:34:15  <mcstar> magnetohydrodynamics, love at first sight
2012-02-06T08:34:49  <delt0r> even have thought about switching to plasma physics for a day job
2012-02-06T08:34:49  <delt0r> oh... its not a crisis ... yet
2012-02-06T08:35:08  <mcstar> well, i guess you know about Peak Oil theory
2012-02-06T08:35:36  <delt0r> of course... but the numbers don't lie... we are going to limp along for another 80-100 years yet...
2012-02-06T08:36:16  <delt0r> as much as everyone what to cut carbon emissions... no one want to do it at the expense of life style..
2012-02-06T08:36:29  <delt0r> shale oil, coal etc... will be burnt...
2012-02-06T08:36:43  <delt0r> and even converted to oil as required...
2012-02-06T08:37:11  <mcstar> but demand grows exponentially->gives stability to economy->but soon we cant fulfill deman->demand slowly shrinks->economy becomes more irregular and extremal->society colapses
2012-02-06T08:37:12  <delt0r> its not the next 100 years that is the real problem... its the 100 years after than
2012-02-06T08:37:13  <delt0r> that
2012-02-06T08:38:10  <delt0r> demands don't in fact grow exponentially... for example energy use in the western world is not going up... that what peak whatever is about...
2012-02-06T08:38:24  <delt0r> economist may say otherwise of course
2012-02-06T08:38:30  <mleise> omg omg how cute http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/funny-pictures-gif-my-deerest1.gif
2012-02-06T08:38:38  <mcstar> it is, wordlwide
2012-02-06T08:39:32  <delt0r> but no one expects the population to that much larger... and once the 3rd world gets the same life style ... usage levels out... as it has done in the west

2012-02-06T08:40:10  <delt0r> china IIRC is something like 1kW
2012-02-06T08:40:22  <delt0r> and Africa is half that
2012-02-06T08:40:52  <delt0r> so yea... a bit... but a long way from an exp curve... long term...
2012-02-06T08:41:15  <delt0r> Not making this up... others do hold the same option. Of course only time will tell
2012-02-06T08:41:19  <delt0r> well not really
2012-02-06T08:41:28  <pairofdice> sweet dystopian future
2012-02-06T08:41:29  <delt0r> we can't have exp grown... no matter what
2012-02-06T08:41:37  <delt0r> even fusion won't give us that
2012-02-06T08:41:42  <mcstar> anyway, seeing what happened to economy from 2008, it is pretty obvious that the most sensitive assets and the whole market is in the hands of monkeys
2012-02-06T08:41:45  <pairofdice> But atleast there will be filtered water
2012-02-06T08:41:59  <mcstar> so any considerable change can mean chatastrophy
2012-02-06T08:42:27  <delt0r> mcstar: that comforts me... given that even with monkeys at the helm, things kinda work mostly... is good news :D
2012-02-06T08:42:47  <mcstar> delt0r: ofc we cant have exponential growth, but we had/have it
2012-02-06T08:42:54  <mcstar> it will stop
2012-02-06T08:43:02  <delt0r> as did population growth
2012-02-06T08:43:09  <mcstar> but, can you guarantee that it will be peaceful?
2012-02-06T08:43:17  <delt0r> who can...
2012-02-06T08:43:34  <delt0r> but i don't think the sky is falling any more now than any other time
2012-02-06T08:43:41  <mcstar> so what im saying, is that we will experience great changes much sooner than 100 years from now
2012-02-06T08:43:56  <delt0r> we seem to love the idea of living in "interesting times" no matter what the time
2012-02-06T08:44:17  <mcstar> i never lived in another time, so i cant say
2012-02-06T08:44:25  <mcstar> but this is itneresting times
2012-02-06T08:44:31  <delt0r> mcstar: I still strongly disagree with that... we will see the start of big changes... the next 100 years will be the real test
2012-02-06T08:45:09  <mcstar> delt0r: ok, as a side-project, will you help me communicating with dolphins?
2012-02-06T08:45:13  <delt0r> it is always interesting times... we are always on the brink, we must always repent of some "sin" or else
2012-02-06T08:45:32  <delt0r> frak the dolphins...
2012-02-06T08:45:35  <delt0r> :/
2012-02-06T08:45:37  <mcstar> oh
2012-02-06T08:45:42  <mcstar> i like dolphins
2012-02-06T08:45:54  <mcstar> i would like to prove that they are as intelligent as humans
2012-02-06T08:46:14  <delt0r> mcstar: well i work with a group that studies launage devoplemt in animals and humans
2012-02-06T08:46:22  <mcstar> haha
2012-02-06T08:46:25  <mcstar> im not surpised
2012-02-06T08:46:34  <delt0r> mcstar: its easy to prove they are not... sorry...
2012-02-06T08:46:51  <mcstar> can you  cite one profession that you werent involved in?
2012-02-06T08:47:17  <delt0r> we really stand apart...
2012-02-06T08:47:17  <delt0r> no animal gets close to humans... its interesting to ask why...
2012-02-06T08:47:25  <mcstar> why?
2012-02-06T08:47:35  <mcstar> i mean elaborate on the first part
2012-02-06T08:47:43  <delt0r> what makes us so different ...
2012-02-06T08:47:46  <mcstar> how do you prove they are inferior?
2012-02-06T08:47:54  <delt0r> not inferior
2012-02-06T08:48:37  <delt0r> less intelligent... ie lack some reasoning and stuff.. some classes of problems that we all solve easily they can't
2012-02-06T08:49:04  <delt0r> ironically crows do better at only those tasks.
2012-02-06T08:49:23  <mleise> crows are really clever
2012-02-06T08:49:29  <mcstar> are those visual probelms?
2012-02-06T08:49:29  <delt0r> I don't remeber we last had the combined meeting in dec
2012-02-06T08:50:01  <mleise> if crows had arms, they would own us
2012-02-06T08:50:05  <mcstar> dolphin brains are reallu huge
2012-02-06T08:50:05  <delt0r> mcstar: i don't recall now... just they are not as smart as popular option holds out...
2012-02-06T08:50:16  <delt0r> also dophines are very mean...
2012-02-06T08:50:27  <delt0r> rape is common for example...
2012-02-06T08:50:46  <mcstar> oh, i read about homosexuality among animals
2012-02-06T08:50:51  <mcstar> thanks, wiki
2012-02-06T08:50:54  <delt0r> lol
2012-02-06T08:51:20  <delt0r> yea most mammals exhibit it to some extend
2012-02-06T08:51:29  <delt0r> as well as masturbation...
2012-02-06T08:51:37  <delt0r> is this a family channel ?
2012-02-06T08:51:37  <mcstar> damn monkeys
2012-02-06T08:51:53  <mcstar> they are just bored probably...
2012-02-06T08:52:10  <delt0r> better than thowing poop
2012-02-06T08:52:14  <mcstar> haha
2012-02-06T08:52:30  <mcstar> thats funny
2012-02-06T08:52:56  <mcstar> so dolphins rape each other?
2012-02-06T08:53:02  <mcstar> thats sort of weird
2012-02-06T08:53:08  <mleise> how does that work?
2012-02-06T08:53:13  <mcstar> since they dont have arms and such
2012-02-06T08:53:15  <mleise> they can hardly grap each other
2012-02-06T08:53:18  <mcstar> yes
2012-02-06T08:53:22  <mcstar> grab
2012-02-06T08:53:29  <mleise> grapling hook
2012-02-06T08:53:34  <mleise> grap
2012-02-06T08:54:13  <delt0r> the male isolates the female and starve her until submission...
2012-02-06T08:54:16  <thestinger> I googled it, first hit was a furry encyclopedia :\
2012-02-06T08:54:16  <mcstar> grapple
2012-02-06T08:54:20  <mcstar> not grap
2012-02-06T08:54:36  <mleise> omg they gang rape
2012-02-06T08:54:52  <mcstar> what? "dolphin rape"?
2012-02-06T08:54:57  <delt0r> if they are as smart as us... i don't want to talk to em
2012-02-06T08:55:05  <mcstar> Dolphins try to rape people?? - Yahoo! Answers
2012-02-06T08:55:25  <delt0r> of course there is more to language than intelligence.
2012-02-06T08:55:29  <mcstar> humans are the most cruel animals ever
2012-02-06T08:55:41  <delt0r> mcstar: not even close
2012-02-06T08:55:47  <delt0r> not even remotely...
2012-02-06T08:55:51  <mcstar> what are you talking about?
2012-02-06T08:55:55  <delt0r> go to some bio classes
2012-02-06T08:56:07  <mcstar> i wont...
2012-02-06T08:56:12  <mcstar> so just tell me
2012-02-06T08:56:45  <delt0r> sure you can find *isolated* examples... of typical behavour in other animals...
2012-02-06T08:57:22  <delt0r> ie tigers, if they are a bit hungry ... will eat there own cubs.. so do pigs.
2012-02-06T08:57:30  <thestinger> mcstar: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/science/22chimp.html
2012-02-06T08:57:30  <delt0r> their
2012-02-06T08:58:06  <mcstar> ...net is slow today forme....
2012-02-06T08:58:24  <mcstar> cub==offspring?
2012-02-06T08:58:44  <delt0r> the reason we have 7 Billon of us here is that for the most part we get along really well
2012-02-06T08:58:59  <delt0r> sure we could do better
2012-02-06T08:59:03  <pairofdice> Ants get along really good too
2012-02-06T08:59:15  <mcstar> i dont think we get along well
2012-02-06T08:59:47  <delt0r> but that is not the same as worst
2012-02-06T08:59:49  <delt0r> So far i don't think we can even demonstrate empathy in any other animal.
2012-02-06T08:59:50  <pairofdice> No one has tried to kill or rob me yet
2012-02-06T09:00:20  <mcstar> i think humans can suppress emotions with logic
2012-02-06T09:00:37  <mcstar> so we are able to controll ourselfes better than animals

2012-02-06T09:02:36  <thestinger> mleise: crows do something similar too
2012-02-06T09:02:51  <delt0r> as do cows...
2012-02-06T09:03:00  <mcstar> retaliation, the thinking about consequences, thinking about the future, is a very strong de-motivation for killing and all bad things
2012-02-06T09:03:23  <delt0r> but that is not nessicallry empathy... don't recall how they decide however...
2012-02-06T09:04:03  <mleise> yeah empathy is feeling with someone who is still alive
2012-02-06T09:04:05  <delt0r> elephants probably get the closest... but then they kick out members all the time and leave them to die... often enough
2012-02-06T09:04:58  <delt0r> mcstar: i think understand someone elses pain is also a strong demotivator
2012-02-06T09:05:15  <delt0r> understanding... shesh i suck at this
2012-02-06T09:05:30  <mcstar> i think that depends more on the individual
2012-02-06T09:05:32  <mleise> is that empathy or is that logical reflecting?
2012-02-06T09:06:11  <mleise> sure a crow can steal from another crows food cache and watch out that noone is looking while hiding its own food
2012-02-06T09:06:15  <delt0r> empathy IIRC is "feeling" or the ability to feel someone else pain or emotional state.
2012-02-06T09:06:41  <antimatroid1> define feel
2012-02-06T09:06:47  <delt0r> hard to do...
2012-02-06T09:07:08  <mleise> go to the biochemical level
2012-02-06T09:07:27  <delt0r> i guess in practice its if the animal can learn about things from watching others make painful mistakes.
2012-02-06T09:07:49  <mcstar> i mean knowing, that you might get killed in retaliation of having killed someone is a better demotivation, than just imagining the emotional pain of the family members' of the victim
2012-02-06T09:07:53  <delt0r> for example a dog watching another dog get the smackdown off an electric fence learns nothing
2012-02-06T09:08:14  <mleise> really? stupid dog
2012-02-06T09:08:36  <mcstar> i dont like dogs
2012-02-06T09:08:41  <mcstar> they bark too much
2012-02-06T09:08:45  <delt0r> mcstar: punishment has long been shown to be ineffective for deterring crime. Harsher prison terms etc don't work
2012-02-06T09:08:50  <mleise> so if *that* was empathy, then crows do have it
2012-02-06T09:08:51  <delt0r> lol

2012-02-06T09:09:57  <mleise> delt0r: I'm sure. Some corvids produce tools as well. That has to be passed on somehow
2012-02-06T09:10:41  <delt0r> mleise: spacial reasoning is crows has challenged how we measure intelligence in other animals.
2012-02-06T09:11:12  <delt0r> its not just tool use. its complicated tool use... the most advanced outside humans as far as we know
2012-02-06T09:11:20  <delt0r> ie hooks
2012-02-06T09:11:23  <mleise> i know
2012-02-06T09:11:28  <mcstar> so i still dont see why cant dolphins be as intelligent as us, with that huge brains of their
2012-02-06T09:11:35  <delt0r> lol
2012-02-06T09:11:54  <mleise> they have a sonar in there you know?
2012-02-06T09:11:59  <mcstar> yes
2012-02-06T09:12:02  <pairofdice> So do bats
2012-02-06T09:12:22  <mcstar> thats why their hearing is much more sophisticated than ours, and their sight
2012-02-06T09:12:33  <delt0r> well i guess we just don't know yet.. but like i said. It easy to come up with things that even retarded humans have no problem with... some animals could do one or two of the test... only we can do all
2012-02-06T09:12:44  <mcstar> can you tell me 100% sure, that they dont actually speak a language?
2012-02-06T09:13:09  <mcstar> delt0r: did you by any chance read Left in the Dark?
2012-02-06T09:13:12  <delt0r> the consensus is that they don't ....

2012-02-06T10:18:15  <delt0r> only ever for US companies...
2012-02-06T10:18:27  <rwest> I have done 2
2012-02-06T10:18:33  <delt0r> the rest of the world doesn't care
2012-02-06T10:18:38  <rwest> both by shrinks heh
2012-02-06T10:18:51  <mcstar> so how much?
2012-02-06T10:18:53  <rwest> and they were the same result and completely different tests
2012-02-06T10:19:17  <rwest> they are designed in a way so that you do not need prior knowledge
2012-02-06T10:19:22  <rwest> they give you an example
2012-02-06T10:19:36  <rwest> and then give you basic problems using that working up to harder ones
2012-02-06T10:19:38  <delt0r> also they claim things that can't work statistically
2012-02-06T10:19:42  <rwest> and it'
2012-02-06T10:19:45  <rwest> s times
2012-02-06T10:19:49  <rwest> timed
2012-02-06T10:19:55  <rwest> to see how fast you learn
2012-02-06T10:20:08  <rwest> since each problem builds off the previous in concepts
2012-02-06T10:20:09  <delt0r> you can't claim a standard deviation of 3 if the question don't have that kind of resoultion.
2012-02-06T10:20:31  <rwest> I have never taken an IQ test with grammar
2012-02-06T10:21:05  <delt0r> there is very little to back them up... in fact most data shows they don't work as intended.
2012-02-06T10:21:20  <delt0r> as in you can get better at iq tests...
2012-02-06T10:21:23  <delt0r> for example
2012-02-06T10:21:33  <mcstar> they must be accurate, the average people always scores 100
2012-02-06T10:21:39  <delt0r> lol
2012-02-06T10:21:42  <mcstar> lol
2012-02-06T10:21:48  <pairofdice> olo
2012-02-06T10:21:50  * mcstar jokes
2012-02-06T10:21:58  <delt0r> you know i never meet Mr Average?
2012-02-06T10:22:23  <mcstar> i was afraid you wont get my joke..
2012-02-06T10:23:09  <pairofdice> But can I return it?
2012-02-06T10:23:24  <pairofdice> I didn't order this
2012-02-06T10:23:25  <mcstar> sure
2012-02-06T10:23:35  <mcstar> what'd you like instead?

2012-02-06T10:29:09  <mcstar> no, thats too much
2012-02-06T10:29:13  <mcstar> 10-100
2012-02-06T10:29:23  <delt0r> smart mouth
2012-02-06T10:29:47  <mcstar> what i "feel" is that its not decided at all
2012-02-06T10:30:16  <mcstar> you have to campaign with your idea probably
2012-02-06T10:30:25  <mcstar> gather supporters
2012-02-06T10:30:26  <delt0r> well once one idea gets going a bit in the forums, other topics just don't get a sideways look
2012-02-06T10:30:29  <mcstar> put up a vota..
2012-02-06T10:30:31  <mcstar> e
2012-02-06T10:33:58  <mcstar> i might get stoned here, saying this, but since this is an AI challenge, i wouldnt be disappointed to see somethign more ai related for the next challenge
2012-02-06T10:34:17  <mcstar> where you actually have to use some state-of-the-art-ish ai technique
2012-02-06T10:34:31  <delt0r> you mean like something abstract and so boring that no one enters? :D
2012-02-06T10:34:37  <mcstar> pfff
2012-02-06T10:34:41  <mcstar> boring for some
2012-02-06T10:34:49  <delt0r> and what is a state of the art AI?
2012-02-06T10:35:06  <mcstar> i am sure it isnt pathfinding
2012-02-06T10:35:12  <mcstar> or game-tree search
2012-02-06T10:35:20  <delt0r> so what is it?
2012-02-06T10:35:33  <mcstar> im not an expert
2012-02-06T10:35:41  <delt0r> since heuristic is what gets used for the rest
2012-02-06T10:35:41  <pairofdice> Natural language processing, robotics?
2012-02-06T10:35:47  *** dorisabayon is now known as Fandekasp
2012-02-06T10:35:49  <mcstar> but these machine learnign things and probabilistic modeling stuff sounds interesting
2012-02-06T10:36:20  <delt0r> Natural language processing would be inaccessible to many... just the databases that are needed
2012-02-06T10:36:47  <delt0r> robotics... well yes and know.. if its abstracted enough from just the basic physical control problem
2012-02-06T10:36:51  <delt0r> but to do what?
2012-02-06T10:37:07  <pairofdice> Indeed
2012-02-06T10:37:15  <mcstar> the problem is that it perhaps wouldnt fit into 2 months
2012-02-06T10:37:23  <pairofdice> This is supposed to be fun and accessible, no?
2012-02-06T10:37:24  <delt0r> or 20 years
2012-02-06T10:37:39  <delt0r> considering thats how long the experts have been working on these problems
2012-02-06T10:37:58  <mcstar> ok, but am i the only one thinking this isnt really ai?
2012-02-06T10:38:00  <delt0r> pairofdice: yes... fun and accessible are general requirements
2012-02-06T10:38:11  <delt0r> mcstar: not really...
2012-02-06T10:38:29  <delt0r> but i can't see how working on a very open game problem is *not* ai...
2012-02-06T10:38:40  <delt0r> since A* hardly won you the ants game
2012-02-06T10:39:01  <delt0r> in fact it was hardly even  a start
2012-02-06T10:40:02  <delt0r> I mean for something complicated but accessible some kind of cut down RTS would be an interesting AI problem
2012-02-06T10:40:16  <delt0r> which means almost all high level stuff is heuristics...
2012-02-06T10:40:52  <delt0r> mcstar: perhaps you want to go straight to strong AI?
2012-02-06T10:41:04  <pairofdice> uh oh
2012-02-06T10:41:07  <mcstar> thats is not feasible
2012-02-06T10:41:12  <delt0r> first to demonstrate self awareness wins!
2012-02-06T10:41:13  <mcstar> -s
2012-02-06T10:42:54  <delt0r> mcstar: so what kind of problem do you consider true AI?
2012-02-06T10:43:17  <pairofdice> Choosing good politicians
2012-02-06T10:43:45  <delt0r> that is not AI, it is a exercise in futility.
2012-02-06T10:44:13  <delt0r> the set good intersect politician is empty
2012-02-06T10:44:21  <mcstar> i have no idea what id like to see specifically
2012-02-06T10:44:39  <mcstar> i want something more theoretically challenging
2012-02-06T10:44:41  <delt0r> mcstar: generally? tring to get an idea of what you really mean here
2012-02-06T10:44:46  <mcstar> but that wouldnt fit the time frame
2012-02-06T10:44:53  <pairofdice> well get rid of the politicians entirely, let the AI run the government
2012-02-06T10:45:05  <pairofdice> what could go rong?
2012-02-06T10:45:09  <delt0r> i mean ants is theoretically fairly intractable!
2012-02-06T10:45:46  <mcstar> so?
2012-02-06T10:45:54  <delt0r> pairofdice: AR in his latest book, Blue Remembered Earth has something like that... called the mechanism.
2012-02-06T10:46:03  <mcstar> if you mean theoretical==exact
2012-02-06T10:46:22  <delt0r> mcstar: so what do you mean by theoretical... since they are all very challenging in theory
2012-02-06T10:47:00  <mcstar> theoretical=you can actually derive some results, dont have to rely on gut feeling, can predict something at all
2012-02-06T10:47:10  <delt0r> ahh i c
2012-02-06T10:47:33  <delt0r> of course some don't like those kind of problem for the same reason you like em...
2012-02-06T10:47:52  <delt0r> personally i dont' care too much if the problem itself is interesting
2012-02-06T10:48:34  <rwest> I would love the next challenge to be another rts
2012-02-06T10:49:16  <delt0r> rwest: think quite a few of us would... but at the same time... it needs to be different from the previous challenge
2012-02-06T10:49:28  <delt0r> also it needs to be a simple RTS
2012-02-06T10:49:45  <rwest> it should be starcraft
2012-02-06T10:49:46  <rwest> gogo
2012-02-06T10:49:52  <delt0r> too complicated
2012-02-06T10:49:56  <mcstar> but there are specifically rts challenges around...
2012-02-06T10:50:01  <delt0r> and there are already comps for it
2012-02-06T10:50:01  <rwest> not really
2012-02-06T10:50:22  <rwest> you could have something with the complications of sc
2012-02-06T10:50:30  <rwest> but the data provided to the bot would be greater
2012-02-06T10:50:45  <delt0r> well there is the MIT comp for SC already... just enter that
2012-02-06T10:51:20  <delt0r> i wouldn't mind some more abstract type of game. like some board games
2012-02-06T10:51:30  <rwest> most board games would not work
2012-02-06T10:51:40  <delt0r> but then i am aways partical to a space shooter
2012-02-06T10:52:07  <rwest> in fact, I can't think of many board games that would work
2012-02-06T10:52:18  <rwest> other than like the RP ones
2012-02-06T10:52:26  <delt0r> rwest: not true... most can be easily adapted to simultaneous turns...
2012-02-06T10:52:36  <rwest> well not the turns problem
2012-02-06T10:52:53  <delt0r> and would work... of course many already have ai comps out there... so there is no point
2012-02-06T10:53:02  <rwest> actually siumultaneous turns would solve a lot of issues most games have
2012-02-06T10:54:16  <delt0r> There is also the possibility of single player games... where you just try and get the best score...
2012-02-06T10:54:26  <rwest> I want super puzzle fighter!
2012-02-06T10:54:30  <rwest> or dr mario
2012-02-06T10:54:31  <rwest> lol
2012-02-06T10:55:29  <delt0r> but it does need to be interesting to watch...
2012-02-06T10:55:44  <rwest> those 2 would be
2012-02-06T10:55:45  <delt0r> this is a general requirement by the higher powers
2012-02-06T10:56:45  <pairofdice> How far would  a strong AI get in "I want to be the guy" before succumbing to tears and curling into a ball
2012-02-06T10:57:19  <delt0r> strong ai does not imply emotions. :/
2012-02-06T10:57:52  <delt0r> but the desire to wipe out its creators!
2012-02-06T10:58:20  <delt0r> I like the idea of hidden information
2012-02-06T10:58:31  <delt0r> stratego is great
2012-02-06T10:59:26  <mcstar> from star trek?
2012-02-06T10:59:37  <delt0r> the board game
2012-02-06T11:00:17  <delt0r> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego
2012-02-06T11:01:25  <mcstar> a board game is not appealing graphically at all
2012-02-06T11:01:36  <delt0r> you don't think?
2012-02-06T11:01:36  <mcstar> if anything, graphics makes in more un-understandable
2012-02-06T11:01:47  <mleise> stratego has awesome lakes
2012-02-06T11:02:11  <mcstar> all in all a board game is not a bad idea, im not against it
2012-02-06T11:02:12  <rwest> stratego would be good
2012-02-06T11:02:20  <rwest> but only if we are given both parts of the moves
2012-02-06T11:02:24  <mcstar> probably wouldbe better than some asteroids game
2012-02-06T11:02:26  <rwest> as in starting and end position
2012-02-06T11:03:09  <delt0r> also it would be simultaneous moves... well that is what i would want
2012-02-06T11:03:29  <delt0r> to avoid copyright it would be slightly more abstract.
2012-02-06T11:03:29  <rwest> ewww
2012-02-06T11:03:49  <rwest> you can straight copy the whole thing
2012-02-06T11:03:54  <rwest> just can't use the same wording
2012-02-06T11:04:17  <rwest> look how many monopoly clones there are
2012-02-06T11:04:26  <rwest> or risk
2012-02-06T11:04:53  <delt0r> no you can't... you can copy the game play... but if you call everything the same thing, then there is substantial coping... and we would need lawyers which is not worth it
2012-02-06T11:05:06  <rwest> delt0r: "change the wording"
2012-02-06T11:05:12  <rwest> I include names in that
2012-02-06T11:05:13  <delt0r> not enough
2012-02-06T11:05:20  <delt0r> if a marshal is a marshal...
2012-02-06T11:05:25  <rwest> look at Lux Deluxe
2012-02-06T11:05:41  <rwest> straight risk clone
2012-02-06T11:05:49  <delt0r> so it needs to be a super orc or something... aka the monopoly clones don't have a mayfair street
2012-02-06T11:06:04  <delt0r> its just cheaper than dealing with lawyers... even if you would win
2012-02-06T11:06:05  <rwest> Lux has the original map
2012-02-06T11:06:51  <delt0r> that would be easy to take to court and win... copying the orginal map is a clear copyright thing...
2012-02-06T11:07:07  <delt0r> at least in the west
2012-02-06T11:07:28  <rwest> well it's redone
2012-02-06T11:07:35  <rwest> but nothing is changed but the graphic
2012-02-06T11:07:37  <delt0r> either way... its not something they/we would bother with
2012-02-06T11:07:53  <rwest> I think something totally new is best though
2012-02-06T11:07:54  <delt0r> just not worth it
2012-02-06T11:08:00  <rwest> no pre-conceived strategies
2012-02-06T11:08:15  <pairofdice> tanks!
2012-02-06T11:08:33  <rwest> solvable
2012-02-06T11:08:43  <delt0r> how so?
2012-02-06T11:08:45  <rwest> well for the most part
2012-02-06T11:08:54  <rwest> assuming you mean like scorched earth type tanks
2012-02-06T11:09:00  <pairofdice> No no no
2012-02-06T11:11:01  <mcstar> The strategy of destroying the food supply of the civilian population in an area of conflict has been banned under Article 54 of Protocol I of the 1977 Geneva Conventions.
2012-02-06T11:11:14  <rwest> mcstar: ?
2012-02-06T11:11:27  <mcstar> wikipedia on scorched earth tactics
2012-02-06T11:11:31  <rwest> http://www.scorch2000.com/
2012-02-06T11:11:33  <pairofdice> haha
2012-02-06T11:12:33  <delt0r> thing is, winners get to define the rules after the war is over... and even apply those rules rather selectively
2012-02-06T11:12:55  <delt0r> there are some 2d ai tank games out there already
2012-02-06T11:13:25  *** Israfel <Israfel!~jeff@99-0-14-82.lightspeed.frokca.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2012-02-06T11:13:42  <rwest> even if you hide almost all data from an AI in a game like scorched
2012-02-06T11:13:55  <rwest> after 1 turn, everything can be calculated
2012-02-06T11:14:16  <delt0r> rwest: that was not the type of tank game suggested...
2012-02-06T11:14:17  <rwest> assuming you tell the AI where it hit
2012-02-06T11:14:24  <rwest> what was?
2012-02-06T11:14:37  <delt0r> pairofdice can correct me if i am wrong
2012-02-06T11:14:55  <delt0r> but i was assuming some sort of 2d tank game
2012-02-06T11:15:00  <rwest> I guess if you did top down
2012-02-06T11:15:04  <delt0r> yea
2012-02-06T11:15:13  <rwest> still, turn based
2012-02-06T11:15:13  <delt0r> sorry.. guess the other is 2d too.
2012-02-06T11:15:16  <delt0r> no
2012-02-06T11:15:22  <delt0r> well yes...
2012-02-06T11:15:32  <delt0r> but like ants etc... turns all at the same time
2012-02-06T11:15:43  <delt0r> aka "real time"
2012-02-06T11:15:48  <delt0r> something like that
2012-02-06T11:15:54  <rwest> yea, but with tanks it wouldn't be interesting I don't think
2012-02-06T11:15:59  <pairofdice> partial information, real time, random results
2012-02-06T11:16:04  <delt0r> depends on details
2012-02-06T11:16:32  <delt0r> eg the maps can add a strong strategic element...
2012-02-06T11:16:37  <rwest> you would have to hide the detail of projectiles I think
2012-02-06T11:16:41  <delt0r> depending on how this affects game dynamics
2012-02-06T11:16:49  <mcstar> how about accepting that Ants was the greatest ai challenge, and it would be pointless to organize another challenge?
2012-02-06T11:16:56  <pairofdice> slow-ish projectiles
2012-02-06T11:17:17  <delt0r> rwest: its not a phyiscs simulation
2012-02-06T11:17:48  <rwest> delt0r: I know, but them being easily dodgeable makes the game well, boring
2012-02-06T11:17:52  <delt0r> mcstar: you seem a bit jaded with the whole thing?
2012-02-06T11:17:58  <rwest> I have coded AI for games where I could dodge them
2012-02-06T11:18:03  <rwest> was kind of lame
2012-02-06T11:18:27  <delt0r> you can't doge bullets... well i would never do it that way
2012-02-06T11:19:04  <delt0r> but i don't see a big difference between the Asteroids suggestion and tanks...
2012-02-06T11:19:32  <rwest> I'm not the biggest fan of asteroid either heh
2012-02-06T11:19:38  <pairofdice> pff!
2012-02-06T11:19:44  <rwest> unless it was real time
2012-02-06T11:19:55  <delt0r> it is
2012-02-06T11:19:56  <rwest> I want to make an xpilot bot though
2012-02-06T11:20:56  <rwest> a set number of distinct turns where things are calculated in phases
2012-02-06T11:21:08  <rwest> is not real time
2012-02-06T11:21:51  <delt0r> it is in pratice... that the only way to implement it for this sort of thing...
2012-02-06T11:22:15  <delt0r> its not the soccer simulation league... we are not all going to turn up with our own hardware
2012-02-06T11:23:10  <rwest> it can be done quite easily on servers..
2012-02-06T11:24:30  <delt0r> not fairly with 5 players at once on the same machine
2012-02-06T11:24:37  <rwest> VMs
2012-02-06T11:24:55  <delt0r> does not make the same machine more than one machine
2012-02-06T11:25:06  <rwest> but it can split the resources correctly
2012-02-06T11:25:18  <delt0r> also its a much higher barrier to entery
2012-02-06T11:25:22  <rwest> so there is no advantage

2012-02-06T11:25:36  <rwest> how so?
2012-02-06T11:25:47  <rwest> well I guess a little bit
2012-02-06T11:26:09  <delt0r> for the soccor leauge, a huge amount of the dev work is getting the bot to output orders at the last possible moment, but not so late that is missed a internal server tick
2012-02-06T11:26:35  <rwest> well there would be no internal server tick
2012-02-06T11:26:43  <rwest> orders processed as received
2012-02-06T11:26:50  <delt0r> rwest: VMs etc *do not time slice fairly* these are not real time systems...
2012-02-06T11:27:03  <delt0r> rwest: there is no way to do that
2012-02-06T11:27:14  <delt0r> you must have a internal update cycle
2012-02-06T11:27:19  <rwest> delt0r: you divide it up so that you do not use more than the systems available resources.

2012-02-06T11:27:58  <delt0r> otherwise it would be a semaphore nightmare with totally arbitrary execution.
2012-02-06T11:28:29  <rwest> I believe AWS has 8-core systems
2012-02-06T11:28:33  <delt0r> rwest: does not matter how. The system divides it up the way it pleases... i have worked on this sort of thing..
2012-02-06T11:28:40  <delt0r> not only would it not work...
2012-02-06T11:28:49  <delt0r> but its a massive amount of work for what?
2012-02-06T11:29:02  <delt0r> just have 5 turns per sec
2012-02-06T11:29:04  <delt0r> done and done
2012-02-06T11:29:17  <rwest> well since they use AWS
2012-02-06T11:29:32  <rwest> provisioning a bunch of small instances
2012-02-06T11:29:49  <delt0r> rwest: and how many address and data busses does it have?
2012-02-06T11:30:06  <delt0r> works fine for a web server... not for real time stuff... not real real time stuff anyway
2012-02-06T11:30:42  <rwest> hmm let's see the latency between them
2012-02-06T11:30:43  <rwest> sec
2012-02-06T11:30:46  <delt0r> but hay you want to set it all up then deal with the fall out when everyone complaines that they *don't* get the same cpu time...
2012-02-06T11:30:49  <delt0r> be my guest

2012-02-06T11:35:19  <mcstar> e
2012-02-06T11:35:26  <mcstar> damn, i was disappointed yesterday
2012-02-06T11:36:04  <mcstar> my old laptop with wifi g 54mbps, reached 1.6MB/sec for file copying
2012-02-06T11:36:07  <rwest> delt0r: I would put in time, and they WOULD get the same cpu time
2012-02-06T11:36:13  <delt0r> lol
2012-02-06T11:36:17  <delt0r> yea right
2012-02-06T11:36:22  <delt0r> good luck with that
2012-02-06T11:36:25  <rwest> AWS ...
2012-02-06T11:36:52  <delt0r> oh by the way... if you don't get about 20 games per min there will also be a huge flood of complaints
2012-02-06T11:37:02  <rwest> they don't get that now
2012-02-06T11:37:17  <delt0r> yea... did you read the forums or here?
2012-02-06T11:37:22  <delt0r> that is what i mean...
2012-02-06T11:37:35  <mcstar> so anyway, the only kind of computer games i ever liked was FPS
2012-02-06T11:38:07  <rwest> delt0r: apparently I am supposed to read my chat logs every day, I will get on that
2012-02-06T11:38:15  <delt0r> Magic business talk crap is just that...with VMs etc... i have no time for. We got rid of it on our cluster because it was costing us 50% CPU
2012-02-06T11:38:46  <delt0r> nice for web servers... not much else
2012-02-06T11:39:08  <rwest> EC2 gives you full systems
2012-02-06T11:39:18  <rwest> well virtual systems
2012-02-06T11:39:25  <rwest> with actual resources
2012-02-06T11:39:36  <delt0r> yea i know
2012-02-06T11:39:38  <delt0r> so what
2012-02-06T11:39:45  <mcstar> are you guys talking about some real-time engine for the game?
2012-02-06T11:39:47  <delt0r> it does not give you real time performance...
2012-02-06T11:40:08  <delt0r> its gives you good average time performance... well that can be debated as well
2012-02-06T11:40:18  <delt0r> these are not the same time
2012-02-06T11:40:38  <delt0r> and seriously... i want to see this game engine without an internal step
2012-02-06T11:41:07  <delt0r> i have seen theory papers on it... but never a real implementation...
2012-02-06T11:41:14  <rwest> while(1) { update() }
2012-02-06T11:41:26  <delt0r> that is a internal step
2012-02-06T11:41:34  <rwest> its not a calculatable one...
2012-02-06T11:41:40  <delt0r> yes it is
2012-02-06T11:42:02  <rwest> ...
2012-02-06T11:42:18  <delt0r> when do the bots get updates?
2012-02-06T11:42:28  <delt0r> now the game plays at different rates too.... not a good way to implement it...
2012-02-06T11:42:54  <delt0r> depending on how busy the cpu is or what other processors are doing to the cache
2012-02-06T11:42:57  <delt0r> etc
2012-02-06T11:43:01  <rwest> as with any game played with a server/client
2012-02-06T11:43:31  <rwest> what is on the server is what matters
2012-02-06T11:43:48  <rwest> if the client is behind because of latency or what not, the server doesn't care
2012-02-06T11:43:55  <rwest> well to a point
2012-02-06T11:43:59  <delt0r> not when you have time slots for everything and the bots get a fixed amount of time to do stuff
2012-02-06T11:44:27  <mcstar> how about assigning the clients constant cpu cycles, and time can only advance when everyone used up theirs?
2012-02-06T11:44:37  <delt0r> ie its real time from the perspective of the bot... without all these PITA issues
2012-02-06T11:44:52  <delt0r> why bother? what have you gained? its not a real time real world robot
2012-02-06T11:45:15  <delt0r> KISS.... keep it simple stupid...
2012-02-06T11:45:22  <mcstar> silly
2012-02-06T11:46:03  <delt0r> mcstar: that is the idea... unfortunately this is hard to implement on modern PCs
