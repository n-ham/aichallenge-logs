2010-11-24T00:00:05  <eburnette> You didn't expand quite as fast as Pichu did
2010-11-24T00:00:17  <rebelxt_> davidjliu: 200 move games are usually stand offs. do you get beat on initial expansion by a few ships?
2010-11-24T00:00:32  <davidjliu> usually that's what happens
2010-11-24T00:00:33  <eburnette> Pichu got 3 ships ahead
2010-11-24T00:00:40  <davidjliu> I think I'm very slow on the first move

2010-11-24T00:01:50  <rebelxt_> davidjliu: looking a few turns ahead to see if it's best to wait a turn or a few to capture a better planet in the future compared to the one you can capture right now?
2010-11-24T00:02:38  <davidjliu> that's what it's supposed to do, but I don't think it's really fully functional
2010-11-24T00:03:02  <rebelxt_> davidjliu: mine is still buggy too ;)
2010-11-24T00:04:07  <eburnette> davidjliu: it looks good to me, but you can always tweak your look ahead horizon on that first move depending on distance to enemy or symmetry type
2010-11-24T00:04:09  <rebelxt_> oldsanta must be last official submission ;-)
2010-11-24T00:04:30  <davidjliu> rebelxt_: indeed
2010-11-24T00:05:06  <davidjliu> or rather the previous official submission
2010-11-24T00:05:09  <davidjliu> latest isn't as good, I think
2010-11-24T00:05:32  <davidjliu> eburnette: It doesn't have any strict horizon... it does some hocus-pocus, I think
2010-11-24T00:07:27  <rebelxt_> davidjliu: nice expansion here - http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas.cgi?game_id=21958 - unlike my bot that went after the middle too early
2010-11-24T00:07:55  <eburnette> These new maps are messing me up, expansion assumptions don't hold any more
2010-11-24T00:07:58  <davidjliu> heh, thanks

2010-11-24T00:09:13  <bhasker> do you think one could get the 17 too?
2010-11-24T00:10:07  <davidjliu> yeah, you both should've send out 18 ships on the second turn
2010-11-24T00:10:24  <bhasker> yea i am guessing thats possible, though not sure why my bot didnt do it
2010-11-24T00:10:35  <eburnette> maybe you should get it first
2010-11-24T00:11:06  <rebelxt_> bhasker: is that home planet distance 6 or 7?
2010-11-24T00:11:11  <davidjliu> uh-oh, bot is going into a lose-storm
2010-11-24T00:11:16  <davidjliu> you coudl actually just send 12 ships there
2010-11-24T00:11:28  <davidjliu> and then take the 5 ships from the growth of the other planet
2010-11-24T00:11:39  <davidjliu> (and the 1 extra you sent)
2010-11-24T00:12:10  <rebelxt_> davidjliu: yeah mine is supposed to do this.. but it did not. so either home planet is exposed or it's a bug
2010-11-24T00:12:31  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-24T00:13:07  <davidjliu> my bot is very good at capturing neutral planets as quickly as possible... once it puts its mind to doing so
2010-11-24T00:13:17  <davidjliu> but it doesn't always want to capture neutrals

2010-11-24T00:19:32  <rebelxt_> bhasker: distance between home planets is 7. that 17 can be captured i think.. a great test case
2010-11-24T00:19:45  <bhasker> yea only reason my bot didnt capture it
2010-11-24T00:19:51  <bhasker> is because it considered it was overcommitted
2010-11-24T00:20:45  <bhasker> i just realized i am not doing a good check for how many new ships i can get before i get attacked
2010-11-24T00:20:48  <zeratul> when you call IssueOrder(), are the planets modified immediately or at the end of your turn?
2010-11-24T00:20:49  <bhasker> when acquiring a neutral
2010-11-24T00:20:58  <bhasker> issue order does not modify anything
2010-11-24T00:22:02  <zeratul> If I do a = p.NumShips(); pw.IssueOrder(blah blah); b = p.NumShips(); all in a row on the same turn, will a and b be the same?
2010-11-24T00:22:41  <bhasker> as far as i know the python starter kit

2010-11-24T00:25:39  <bhasker> how do you calculate when you can capture a new neutral
2010-11-24T00:25:43  <rebelxt_> same here.. i'm getting conflicting results from two tcp servers, probably need more time in the saddle
2010-11-24T00:25:45  <bhasker> so in the test case what my bot does is
2010-11-24T00:26:04  <bhasker> i have a check to see if i am already committed to acquiring neutrals
2010-11-24T00:26:16  <bhasker> and if me and enemy are even then i am kind of conservative
2010-11-24T00:26:23  <bhasker> i don't overextend unless i am behind
2010-11-24T00:26:45  <bhasker> and i basically add some # of ships that i think i can get before the enemy attacks from the neutral being acquired
2010-11-24T00:26:54  <rebelxt_> i make a worst case assumption that enemy could try to snipe that neutral from me with all ships.. and take payoff time into account so make sure i can hold it for so many turns after capture
2010-11-24T00:27:04  <bhasker> hmmm

2010-11-24T04:37:55  <medrimonia> I've slept at 5 a.m this morning and wake up really at 9a.m
2010-11-24T04:38:56  <medrimonia> *Watched games in the last 24 hours: 2439*
2010-11-24T04:40:02  <antimatroid1> site crashed?
2010-11-24T04:40:46  <janzert> sort of, amstan's running some pounding queries on it right now

2010-11-24T04:46:32  <lavalamp_> oh my goodness I'm such a moron... I left logging on in my tcp script... of COURSE it timed out
2010-11-24T04:46:56  <amstan> lol
2010-11-24T04:47:24  <antimatroid1> didn't you say it was timing out on official too?
2010-11-24T04:48:34  <lavalamp_> yeah I think I found that problem
2010-11-24T04:48:41  <mega1> janzert: what kind of cpu power do the servers have?
2010-11-24T04:48:48  <lavalamp_> for testing I had upped my time to .9 seconds
2010-11-24T04:48:59  <lavalamp_> I dropped it back down to .75
2010-11-24T04:49:25  <lavalamp_> now if the server would play any games we will hopefully get under 200
2010-11-24T04:49:49  <lavalamp_> #117 right now but I doubt I'll hold it
2010-11-24T04:49:51  <janzert> mega1: take a look at amazon ec2 high cpu medium instance
2010-11-24T04:49:59  <janzert> that's what all the games run on
2010-11-24T04:50:09  <mega1> only one game at a time?
2010-11-24T04:50:18  <mega1> no other activity?
2010-11-24T04:50:19  <janzert> generally two
2010-11-24T04:50:28  <antimatroid1> isn't one of the servers hosting the site too?
2010-11-24T04:50:34  <janzert> nothing else though
2010-11-24T04:50:38  <janzert> antimatroid1: not anymore
2010-11-24T04:50:41  <antimatroid1> :)
2010-11-24T04:52:08  <mega1> "5 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units each)"
2010-11-24T04:52:25  <mega1> what the heck
2010-11-24T04:52:54  <lavalamp_> One EC2 Compute Unit provides the equivalent CPU capacity of a 1.0-1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor.
2010-11-24T04:53:02  <lavalamp_> (quote from further down)
2010-11-24T04:53:27  <antimatroid1> so probably worse than my computer?
2010-11-24T04:53:48  <antimatroid1> i have no idea about those kind of things
2010-11-24T04:54:25  <mega1> aha, so it's about on par with my laptop
2010-11-24T04:54:35  <mega1> but wait, two games on two cores?
2010-11-24T04:57:10  <lavalamp_> yeah that doesn't seem fair
2010-11-24T04:58:04  <antimatroid1> how do the servers play like 30 games a minute?
2010-11-24T04:58:10  <antimatroid1> is that cause some bots just take almost no time?
2010-11-24T04:58:15  <lavalamp_> heh... take out the logging and suddenly I get a lot more nodes in
2010-11-24T04:58:21  <antimatroid1> most of my games take at least a minute
2010-11-24T04:58:54  <lavalamp_> hmmmm still have mysterious timeouts :(
2010-11-24T04:59:08  <antimatroid1> are you deleting information at the end of each turn?
2010-11-24T04:59:20  <antimatroid1> do it at the start of each turn if you are
2010-11-24T04:59:24  <antimatroid1> that solved my timeout issues
2010-11-24T04:59:35  <mega1> I did some tests on a simple cpu machine and mislead myself immensely due to timeouts.
2010-11-24T04:59:43  <lavalamp_> nah go is garbage collected
2010-11-24T04:59:53  <lavalamp_> besides I don't use that much memory
2010-11-24T04:59:56  <antimatroid1> doesn't that still have to delete it though?
2010-11-24T05:00:06  <mega1> so I guess on a two cpu server two games at the same time can also have problems
2010-11-24T05:00:14  <lavalamp_> at some point it does
2010-11-24T05:00:15  <lavalamp_> but it's automatic
2010-11-24T05:00:31  <antimatroid1> i wont run two games on my machine at once
2010-11-24T05:00:50  <antimatroid1> and it's better than what i'm going to get on the official i think
2010-11-24T05:00:56  <lavalamp_> I run lots at once on my machine ^^
2010-11-24T05:00:57  <mega1> janzert: ^^^? (two games at a time)
2010-11-24T05:01:11  <antimatroid1> i get like 300 nodes max per turn atm :|
2010-11-24T05:01:15  <janzert> mega1: yes
2010-11-24T05:01:47  <mega1> janzert: I understand that by now, but don't they affect each other?
2010-11-24T05:01:58  <mega1> due to the timeout being real time
2010-11-24T05:02:07  <antimatroid1> wouldn't it be just as fast to run them one at a time?
2010-11-24T05:02:21  <antimatroid1> minus starting up game cost, that can't be that expensive
2010-11-24T05:02:43  <mega1> a quick bot against a slow bot leaves cpu power unused if only one game is running
2010-11-24T05:02:57  <antimatroid1> ah yeah, i see the issue
2010-11-24T05:02:58  <mega1> but that's about the only fair way to run it.
2010-11-24T05:03:03  <antimatroid1> i think one at a time would be ideal
2010-11-24T05:03:22  <janzert> antimatroid1: most of the time on average is spent between games actually, sending the previous game info the main server and getting the next pairing then possibly download/compiling etc.
2010-11-24T05:03:47  <antimatroid1> you don't recompile bots for every game?
2010-11-24T05:03:52  <janzert> no
2010-11-24T05:04:00  <lavalamp_> it would be ok if you executed the bot's turns in sequence
2010-11-24T05:04:06  <lavalamp_> now that I think about it
2010-11-24T05:04:53  <lavalamp_> does the engine pipe the state to both bots and then wait a second, or does it pipe it to A, wait a sec, then B, wait a sec?
2010-11-24T05:05:11  <janzert> yes, the current system will give more variance in the amount of cpu actually available. Nobody should be starved though.
2010-11-24T05:05:23  <janzert> lavalamp_: pipe to both and wait 1 second, in parallel
2010-11-24T05:05:37  <antimatroid1> hmmmmm
2010-11-24T05:05:40  <janzert> and the current system has been in place since before I started working on the contest
2010-11-24T05:05:52  <lavalamp_> that doesn't seem fair at ALL unless there is a core availible for each :/
2010-11-24T05:06:29  <lavalamp_> sigh I'm STILL timing out
2010-11-24T05:06:36  <lavalamp_> but not locally any more
2010-11-24T05:06:43  <antimatroid1> i guess any bot has equal resources for a given opponent :\
2010-11-24T05:06:57  <antimatroid1> i still think it's the least preferred way
2010-11-24T05:07:11  <antimatroid1> although i realise it wasn't a deicision made by you janzert :)
2010-11-24T05:07:29  <lavalamp_> yeah it means I could do my turn and then busy-wait to starve the other guy of cpu
2010-11-24T05:07:43  <antimatroid1> hmm, i hate to say it, but that's a good idea
2010-11-24T05:07:46  <lavalamp_> for the duration of the time, I mean
2010-11-24T05:08:10  <lavalamp_> I'm too nice to actually implement that but it really is optimal
2010-11-24T05:08:16  <antimatroid1> i wont, but yeah
2010-11-24T05:08:45  <mega1> janzert: so what I can count on is 0.5s - 1s of cpu time, right?
2010-11-24T05:08:54  <lavalamp_> that should be grounds for banning, I think
2010-11-24T05:09:10  <antimatroid1> lavalamp_: it's not at current, perhaps it should be in the future though
2010-11-24T05:09:51  <antimatroid1> you couldn't fairly ban someone for it this tournament i don't think, but i'm not going to add unecessary stress when computing power is limited already
2010-11-24T05:09:58  <antimatroid1> if there were more servers i'd probably do it
2010-11-24T05:10:32  <lavalamp_> or I could allocate as much memory as I could and read/write from/to it randomly to deny the other guy memory throughput
2010-11-24T05:10:44  <antimatroid1> it's a prisoners dilemma to do it or not :P
2010-11-24T05:10:51  <lavalamp_> yes it is
2010-11-24T05:11:02  <lavalamp_> fortunately I cooperate
2010-11-24T05:11:20  <antimatroid1> yep, i rationalise with repeated versions of the game :)
2010-11-24T05:11:30  <lavalamp_> well, for everyone else it's fortunate
2010-11-24T05:11:43  <lavalamp_> it'd be optimal if everyone else was like me ^^
2010-11-24T05:11:57  <antimatroid1> yes, but it's dominated D:
2010-11-24T05:12:00  <janzert> mega1: that sounds right
2010-11-24T05:12:16  <antimatroid1> janzert: any chance of that changing to 1 second per bot?
2010-11-24T05:12:54  <lavalamp_> not if I play myself (i.e. my choice is also the other guy's choice)
2010-11-24T05:12:54  <janzert> not really
2010-11-24T05:13:06  <lavalamp_> eh maybe it technically still is
2010-11-24T05:13:09  <lavalamp_> whatever
2010-11-24T05:13:18  <mega1> janzert: thanks, at least I understand what to optimize for
2010-11-24T05:13:31  <lavalamp_> grrr why do I time out it makes no sense :(
2010-11-24T05:13:58  <mega1> I'll test with a random timeout between 0.5 and 1s
2010-11-24T05:14:18  <lavalamp_> I want all my games to be like this: http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas.cgi?game_id=23020
2010-11-24T05:14:23  <janzert> argh, ok. the game_stats page just went from taking 2+ seconds to load to < 0.5 second for no apparent reason

2010-11-24T05:49:29  <antimatroid1> hmmm, and one gets 0.5 seconds in the more important games too
2010-11-24T05:50:36  <antimatroid1> i have no idea about these kind of things, is it guaranteed that one bot wont only end up with less than 0.5 process time and the other more if they're both trying to use the full one second?
2010-11-24T06:02:26  <mega1> not guaranteed, but it should be close

2010-11-24T07:19:21  <antimatroid1> people seem to like haskell, so i'll give it a go
2010-11-24T07:19:34  <Accoun> C++ and perl the best

2010-11-24T07:20:59  <Accoun> java the good for linux
2010-11-24T07:21:05  <Accoun> but not for me
2010-11-24T07:21:19  <antimatroid1> i don't work as a programmer, so i don't need to use java ever again in my life
2010-11-24T07:21:22  <antimatroid1> it makes me so happy
2010-11-24T07:21:45  <antimatroid1> well that's a lie, i do sort of, but ra work and it's in gauss

2010-11-24T07:23:14  <antimatroid1> it's too many maps
2010-11-24T07:23:38  <Accoun> antimatroid1> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&p=7636#p7604
2010-11-24T07:23:46  <Accoun> antimatroid1> read it
2010-11-24T07:24:13  <Accoun> 75 map set fast give wrong winer (map set related)
2010-11-24T07:24:19  <Accoun> 999 map set give true winer if enougth number of games played, more games more accurate result
2010-11-24T07:24:22  <Accoun> because
2010-11-24T07:24:29  <Accoun> all 999 map sets identical and give the same winer
2010-11-24T07:24:36  <Accoun> all 75 map sets sepecial and give special winer
2010-11-24T07:25:06  <antimatroid1> but it isn't feasible to play enough games on 999 maps to get teh true winner guaranteed
2010-11-24T07:25:10  <antimatroid1> that's the problem
2010-11-24T07:25:25  <Accoun> antimatroid1> it not problem
2010-11-24T07:25:36  <antimatroid1> ideally you want bots around the same ranking to all play each other on the same randomly generated maps
2010-11-24T07:25:37  <Accoun> antimatroid1> problem is wrong winer
2010-11-24T07:25:42  <antimatroid1> then maximise the number of maps that happens for
2010-11-24T07:25:54  <Accoun> antimatroid1> yes, its the best
2010-11-24T07:25:56  <antimatroid1> although probably not quite that strictly
2010-11-24T07:26:12  <antimatroid1> Account: 999 maps is too many for that to happen with
2010-11-24T07:26:15  <Accoun> random map for each game the best metod
2010-11-24T07:26:32  <Accoun> antimatroid1> not
2010-11-24T07:26:45  <antimatroid1> i think a random map for every game is bad
2010-11-24T07:27:04  <lavalamp_> yeah you might get screwed with a bunch of draw maps
2010-11-24T07:27:05  <antimatroid1> well, it depends how many times people play each toher
2010-11-24T07:27:18  <Accoun> antimatroid1> not
2010-11-24T07:27:40  <Error323_> i think its good
2010-11-24T07:27:47  <Error323_> its most fair
2010-11-24T07:27:56  <Accoun> ELO based on win/loses percentes betvin each bot pair
2010-11-24T07:28:03  <antimatroid1> hmm, say top 4 play each other a couple of times each
2010-11-24T07:28:14  <antimatroid1> isn't it preferable if they play each other on the same randomly made map?
2010-11-24T07:28:24  <antimatroid1> map(s)?
2010-11-24T07:28:25  <Error323_> no
2010-11-24T07:28:43  <medrimonia> The draw maps would be a problem
2010-11-24T07:28:57  <Accoun> 75 maps give map set related win/loses percentes
2010-11-24T07:28:58  <Error323_> well say they play eachtother a couple of time each and the random generator picks the same map on which A loses
2010-11-24T07:29:02  <Accoun> it misteike
2010-11-24T07:29:08  <Error323_> and then A gets other opponents
2010-11-24T07:29:17  <antimatroid1> i don't think there's been any maps that would be thown out for too many draws with the newer map generators
2010-11-24T07:29:24  <Accoun> random map give true win/loses percentes if enougth games played
2010-11-24T07:29:33  <Error323_> indeed.
2010-11-24T07:29:39  <antimatroid1> mega1: new map for every game, good or bad?
2010-11-24T07:29:43  <Error323_> but its also more cpu intensive per game
2010-11-24T07:29:51  <Accoun> new map for every game the best
2010-11-24T07:29:56  <antimatroid1> Error323_: maps could be generated now
2010-11-24T07:29:58  <antimatroid1> like thousands
2010-11-24T07:30:05  <antimatroid1> and just use them as needed
2010-11-24T07:30:08  <medrimonia> if you want "True Results", you've got to make each player play against each other player on more than three thousands of maps (and once in each map)
2010-11-24T07:30:39  <Error323_> why three thousand?
2010-11-24T07:30:43  <medrimonia> Just to say that you can't get a True Winner, (in fact I think that bocsimacko will win whatever the set of map is)
2010-11-24T07:30:49  <medrimonia> It's just an idea
2010-11-24T07:30:54  <antimatroid1> i must admit i was first in favour of a new map for each game, but someone previously talked me around
2010-11-24T07:30:57  <antimatroid1> i can't remember who
2010-11-24T07:30:58  <Accoun> medrimonia> not betwin all, only betwin near REAITING bots
2010-11-24T07:31:01  <mega1> antimatroid1: last time I supported random map for each game because I think maps have a greater effect than map+player
2010-11-24T07:31:08  <medrimonia> Even three thousands isn't enough
2010-11-24T07:31:09  <mega1> ... and I still do.
2010-11-24T07:31:15  <antimatroid1> hmmm
2010-11-24T07:31:20  <Error323_> so do I yes
2010-11-24T07:31:37  <antimatroid1> janzert: if we had a strong consensus, would you be willing to use a new map for every game? one could just generate thousands of maps before the contest
2010-11-24T07:31:39  <mega1> with different seeds though :-)
2010-11-24T07:31:51  <Error323_> haha
2010-11-24T07:32:15  <medrimonia> The big problem for me is the draw maps
2010-11-24T07:32:40  <antimatroid1> the few that do pop up a lot of people still seem to fail on
2010-11-24T07:32:50  <antimatroid1> i don't think they're much of an issue
2010-11-24T07:33:31  <antimatroid1> what if a game was repeated on a new map with the same pair of players if a draw happened? is that a good or terrible idea?
2010-11-24T07:33:39  <antimatroid1> i don't think that would be done now, but for the future..
2010-11-24T07:34:10  <Error323_> medrimonia: everyone would have the draw maps problem right?
2010-11-24T07:34:22  <Error323_> so in the limit it wouldn't be a problem
2010-11-24T07:34:30  <medrimonia> Yes but it depends on how much games you'll be playing
2010-11-24T07:34:32  <antimatroid1> we're not getting close to approaching any limit
2010-11-24T07:34:35  <antimatroid1> that's the issue
2010-11-24T07:34:39  <Error323_> that is true
2010-11-24T07:34:55  <Error323_> with 50 maps it would take around 4000 days =)
2010-11-24T07:35:12  <Error323_> given 4500 players
2010-11-24T07:35:13  <medrimonia> if you have let's say 2 percent of chance of having a draw map
2010-11-24T07:35:54  <medrimonia> and each player plays 200 games
2010-11-24T07:36:24  <medrimonia> probability of having zero draw map=0.98^200
2010-11-24T07:36:34  <antimatroid1> well i would be happy for a new map to be used in each game
2010-11-24T07:36:59  <medrimonia> probability of having 1 draw map or more=1-0.98^200
2010-11-24T07:37:01  <antimatroid1> if not a fairly large set to be played on
2010-11-24T07:38:01  <medrimonia> probability of having 2 draw maps or more = 1-0.98^200 -0.98^198*0.02*200
2010-11-24T07:38:02  <medrimonia> etc
2010-11-24T07:38:37  <Error323_> yeah
2010-11-24T07:38:37  <medrimonia> Just to say that you'll probably be having for each person, between 0 and something like 10 percent of draw maps played
2010-11-24T07:38:45  <Error323_> the problem is against whom hehe
2010-11-24T07:39:06  <antimatroid1> is it any worse than the chances of getting one now?
2010-11-24T07:39:09  <medrimonia> and if someone of the top 10 has zero draw map and another has 10 draw maps
2010-11-24T07:39:16  <antimatroid1> if not every bot plays every other one on the same map
2010-11-24T07:39:23  <antimatroid1> even in the same region of rankings
2010-11-24T07:39:24  <medrimonia> The thing is that with those maps
2010-11-24T07:39:25  <medrimonia> w
2010-11-24T07:39:29  <Error323_> probability of playing against a much lower rank is quite a lot smaller then a rank hovered around your rank
2010-11-24T07:39:41  <medrimonia> we can analyze the percentage of draw on each maps
2010-11-24T07:39:54  <Error323_> you could also write a script that detects these maps (0 moves p1 && 0 moves p2 && draw)
2010-11-24T07:39:59  <Error323_> and don't count them
2010-11-24T07:40:11  <antimatroid1> 0 moves the whole game?
2010-11-24T07:40:20  <Error323_> yea?
2010-11-24T07:40:32  <Error323_> or what do you guys define as being random?
2010-11-24T07:40:38  <medrimonia> and if a map seems to really be a draw map, you could remove all the games played on those maps from the database
2010-11-24T07:40:39  <Error323_> ehhhh draw*
2010-11-24T07:40:40  <Error323_> lol
2010-11-24T07:40:59  <antimatroid1> medrimonia: that is what was done last time
2010-11-24T07:41:02  <antimatroid1> i don't like that practive
2010-11-24T07:41:14  <antimatroid1> i think the may have just removed the draw results, but could be wrong
2010-11-24T07:41:21  <Error323_> me neither, draws depend heavily on the players
2010-11-24T07:41:29  <Error323_> i'm kinda wondering whether they should be removed at al
2010-11-24T07:41:30  <medrimonia> Yes but if we go to a random map for each game
2010-11-24T07:41:43  <medrimonia> we have to replay the draw games
2010-11-24T07:41:46  <antimatroid1> yeah, it's letting bots assume draw maps don't exist in a way
2010-11-24T07:41:48  <antimatroid1> which is bad
2010-11-24T07:42:01  <medrimonia> or to verify that the map generated isn't a draw map
2010-11-24T07:42:30  <Error323_> how do you define a draw map now then? true empericial data?
2010-11-24T07:42:37  <Error323_> emperical*
2010-11-24T07:42:39  <Error323_> -.-
2010-11-24T07:42:42  <medrimonia> a really draw map
2010-11-24T07:42:44  <antimatroid1> accoun and i are currently drawing on a map despite having taken all out neutrals on each side of the map
2010-11-24T07:43:00  <Error323_> thats far from a good definition
2010-11-24T07:43:01  <Error323_> imo
2010-11-24T07:43:10  <antimatroid1> and then he got me :\
2010-11-24T07:43:12  <Error323_> it's highly dependant on the player
2010-11-24T07:43:30  <medrimonia> is a map where if you chose to take a planet, the opponent can snipe you or take your home planet
2010-11-24T07:43:42  <medrimonia> that's what a real draw map is for me
2010-11-24T07:44:09  <antimatroid1> i disagree
2010-11-24T07:44:29  <antimatroid1> i think the assumption that you shouldn't lose your home planet to rage bot is reasonable given the max growth at home
2010-11-24T07:44:42  <medrimonia> I don't think so
2010-11-24T07:44:49  <antimatroid1> but to ensure you can take at least one planet without being sniped, given a lot of bots still are vulnerable to that, is bad
2010-11-24T07:44:58  <Error323_> I think we/thedevs would first have to agree on a solid definition of "draw map" before taking them out. janzert, amstan what do you think?
2010-11-24T07:45:03  <antimatroid1> i think the assumption... is fine^^
2010-11-24T07:46:29  <medrimonia> well ok antimatroid1: with the kind of bots active, it's fine with the ragebot thing, but between two good bots, I think that'll make a draw.
2010-11-24T07:46:56  <antimatroid1> the contest isn't run just for the top 10 rankings
2010-11-24T07:47:06  <antimatroid1> while those are the more important ones
2010-11-24T07:47:59  <medrimonia> yes I know, but the thing that is a problem to me is that a good bot will draw against a bot which symply do nothing (or ragebot) in this kind of map
2010-11-24T07:48:17  <antimatroid1> that can already happen
2010-11-24T07:48:48  <antimatroid1> or are we not talking about problems with new maps for every game anymore? :P

2010-11-24T07:49:46  <antimatroid1> it's also a lot cooler for watching if it's a new map every game
2010-11-24T07:49:55  <Error323_> agree

2010-11-24T08:04:21  <janzert> Don't really have time right now to get into the conversation, but my current plan is that bots will play no more than roughly 5 times on any given map.
2010-11-24T08:04:50  <Kingpin13> um, anybody help me with testing a c# bot on my own computer?
2010-11-24T08:04:59  <antimatroid1> janzert: why not just use a new map for each game? you could generate thousands on maps before the contest even started, so it wouldn't cost anything
2010-11-24T08:05:09  <Kingpin13> the tutorial only seems to cover the java bots
2010-11-24T08:07:00  <janzert> because having all the bots go through the bias of any specific map is a good thing, i.e. I want all the bots to face the same biases as much as possible in all aspects not just maps.
2010-11-24T08:07:43  <antimatroid1> yeah, okay, i'm pretty happy with whatever to be honest

2010-11-24T08:13:27  <mega1> Accouns experiment, if I understand it correctly, shows that with 100 maps the risk is rather high.
2010-11-24T08:14:39  <janzert> if we stay reddit'd for the whole finals the total number of games is likely to be really low :{
2010-11-24T08:14:48  <janzert> fortunately I don't think that is going to happen
2010-11-24T08:14:58  <antimatroid1> neither, tell jeff not to post there till the end :P
2010-11-24T08:15:06  <Error323_> and what about generating a lot of maps while for each map test with ragebot, that when draws is removed?
2010-11-24T08:15:57  <antimatroid1> Accoun: with your experiments, how many games had to be played between bots before accurate rankings were found?
2010-11-24T08:16:20  <janzert> ? ragebot will already draw against itself. Also with the current map generator the draw percentage on all maps is pretty low.
2010-11-24T08:16:31  <Error323_> ragebot vs a good bot
2010-11-24T08:16:37  <Accoun> antimatroid1> 333 games on TCP give good rezilt
2010-11-24T08:16:47  <antimatroid1> how do you know?
2010-11-24T08:17:07  <antimatroid1> different people are playing all the time
2010-11-24T08:17:13  <antimatroid1> and changing their bots
2010-11-24T08:17:24  <janzert> tcp also does pretty bad pairing from what I remember
2010-11-24T08:17:28  <Error323_> indeed
2010-11-24T08:17:39  <Error323_> or well its kinda randomish
2010-11-24T08:17:52  <janzert> lots of streakiness
2010-11-24T08:18:03  <antimatroid1> it also pairs on availability
2010-11-24T08:18:08  <antimatroid1> which is good for getting a fast pairing
2010-11-24T08:18:12  <antimatroid1> bad for not getting repeat pairings
2010-11-24T08:18:20  <Error323_> yup
2010-11-24T08:18:21  <janzert> right
2010-11-24T08:18:34  <antimatroid1> but how long do you wait before saying, fine i'll play these two again?
2010-11-24T08:18:51  <Accoun> 333 games on TCP give good rezilt
2010-11-24T08:18:54  <janzert> yep, it's not an easy problem

2010-11-24T08:20:25  <antimatroid1> aha, damnit jeff
2010-11-24T08:21:54  <Error323_> janzert: how does the opponent-picking algo work for the official server
2010-11-24T08:23:52  <janzert> basically avoid recent pairings and randomly pick someone based on a pareto distribution over the difference in rank
2010-11-24T08:24:14  <antimatroid1> stats and i don't go well together
2010-11-24T08:24:27  <Error323_> nice
2010-11-24T08:24:37  <Error323_> that sounds good

2010-11-24T08:25:33  <janzert> yeah, it's not too bad and to get better would probably take a lot of reworking.
2010-11-24T08:26:05  <Error323_> well from the top of my head i wouldn't know anything better
2010-11-24T08:26:38  <Error323_> perhaps experiment with different density functions but yeh thats kind of infeasable ^_^ :

2010-11-24T08:27:29  <antimatroid1> speaking of draws ehe
2010-11-24T08:28:03  <Error323_> yea these kind of draws are impossible to detect and highly dependant on bot pair
2010-11-24T08:28:08  <Error323_> and not "wrong" imo
2010-11-24T08:28:50  <antimatroid1> 88 users on the forums aha
2010-11-24T08:34:09  <janzert> quite an uptick in new users as well, 59 in the past 24 hours it has been hovering in the high teens
2010-11-24T08:34:48  <Error323_> hmm
2010-11-24T08:35:04  <Error323_> weird
2010-11-24T08:35:11  <Error323_> janzert: how many users in total now?
2010-11-24T08:35:57  <janzert> 6925 activated accounts
2010-11-24T08:36:34  <pyro-> excuse me, is my bot process restarted each game? and is the maximum turns still fixed at 200? i want to know if its correct to count down turns remaining that way
2010-11-24T08:37:02  <Error323_> yes pyro-
2010-11-24T08:37:08  <pyro-> thank you :)
2010-11-24T08:37:39  <antimatroid1> it's a bit late for people to be signing up :|
2010-11-24T08:37:54  <Error323_> well
2010-11-24T08:38:04  <Error323_> there's a difference between signing up and time worked on it
2010-11-24T08:38:20  <antimatroid1> i'm looking forward to (hopefully) coming in and snatching first for australia
2010-11-24T08:38:27  <Error323_> some ppl are really secretive
2010-11-24T08:38:29  <antimatroid1> i have to beat smiley
2010-11-24T08:38:40  <Error323_> from the looks of it I'll become #1 of holland :D
2010-11-24T08:38:49  <Error323_> thought it'll be really close
2010-11-24T08:38:50  <antimatroid1> yeah, a lot of people will go who tf is antimatroid when they see me
2010-11-24T08:39:27  <Error323_> i'll implement synchronized attacks
2010-11-24T08:39:32  <Error323_> today
2010-11-24T08:39:38  <Error323_> and then i'm out of things to do
2010-11-24T08:39:39  <Error323_> :S
2010-11-24T08:39:53  <antimatroid1> bah i'm still implementing fairly large things
2010-11-24T08:39:56  <antimatroid1> i better be done in time
2010-11-24T08:40:02  <Error323_> :P
2010-11-24T08:40:03  <antimatroid1> i've changed my game tree slightly too
2010-11-24T08:40:06  <antimatroid1> so i need to get that working
2010-11-24T08:40:26  <antimatroid1> and then it's a final refine of my pick move functions then i can submit
2010-11-24T08:42:27  <Error323_> antimatroid1: where will you rank approximatly?
2010-11-24T08:42:34  <Error323_> do you think
2010-11-24T08:42:52  <antimatroid1> not sure
2010-11-24T08:43:01  <antimatroid1> anywhere from 2-50 hopefully
2010-11-24T08:43:09  <antimatroid1> i like to think i'll be in the upper half of that range
2010-11-24T08:43:29  <janzert> Heh, "Most users ever online was 103 on Wed Nov 24, 2010 8:08 am" <- note time, now I know what people do after arriving at work :P
2010-11-24T08:43:35  <Error323_> hmm that would be my guess for my bot, somewhere in top 30-ish
2010-11-24T08:43:41  <antimatroid1> haha
2010-11-24T08:43:49  <Error323_> janzert: LOL
2010-11-24T08:44:02  <Error323_> 103 btw? that's not a lot
2010-11-24T08:44:06  <Error323_> or is that logged in users?
2010-11-24T08:44:17  <antimatroid1> no, that's active in last live 5 minutes
2010-11-24T08:44:22  <janzert> yeah, I'm kinda surprised it's so low
2010-11-24T08:44:34  <antimatroid1> like* 5 minutes
2010-11-24T08:45:03  <antimatroid1> Error: Vrije Univ. Amsterdam is that the same as uni of amsterdam?

2010-11-24T08:45:19  <janzert> most users must not visit the forums a whole lot
2010-11-24T08:45:39  <Error323_> ohh the forums
2010-11-24T08:45:46  <Error323_> i thought the ranking site
2010-11-24T08:45:48  <antimatroid1> i take it they're your rivals? :P
2010-11-24T08:46:02  <antimatroid1> dimkadimon doesn't know it, but he's my rival
2010-11-24T08:46:14  <antimatroid1> he's australian, goes to anu, and bitched about the map change
2010-11-24T08:46:19  <antimatroid1> and he's using java
2010-11-24T08:46:20  <Error323_> antimatroid1: well yeah sort of, in a funny way though.
2010-11-24T08:46:35  <Error323_> antimatroid1: he needs to die :P
2010-11-24T08:46:40  <antimatroid1> pretty much
2010-11-24T08:47:53  <antimatroid1> i'm guessing it's like aus/nz rivavly
2010-11-24T08:48:14  <antimatroid1> it's offensive in a joking way

2010-11-24T08:58:00  <Error323_> hey bhasker
2010-11-24T08:58:09  <bhasker> wassup
2010-11-24T08:58:39  <Accoun> bocsimacko - give me the formula!!!!
2010-11-24T08:58:46  <bhasker> lol accoun has lost it
2010-11-24T08:58:59  <Error323_> hahaha
2010-11-24T08:59:12  <Error323_> today i'm gonna implement synchronized attacks
2010-11-24T08:59:30  <Error323_> see how that works out
2010-11-24T08:59:35  <bhasker> my bot is stuck at 50
2010-11-24T08:59:40  <bhasker> its not budging from there
2010-11-24T08:59:50  <bhasker> its like it has put its root down and decided rank 50 is where it wants to be
2010-11-24T08:59:54  <antimatroid1> Accoun: you seem to be doing well on official today
2010-11-24T09:00:06  <Accoun> m.b. it not formula?
2010-11-24T09:00:14  <Accoun> m.b. no any formula?
2010-11-24T09:00:20  <antimatroid1> when my bot isn't being stupid it seems about on par with acocun and iouri
2010-11-24T09:00:26  <antimatroid1> so hopefully i may pull off a top 10
2010-11-24T09:00:30  <Accoun> m.b. jast all best fomulas in one give the result?
2010-11-24T09:00:34  <antimatroid1> assuming i can remove the stupid
2010-11-24T09:00:49  <Error323_> antimatroid1: that's quite an assumption :)
2010-11-24T09:00:52  <Accoun> m.b. it worch only if no any bugs?
2010-11-24T09:00:55  <antimatroid1> it is :P
2010-11-24T09:01:02  <Accoun> wth is the wuestion!
2010-11-24T09:01:04  <bhasker> whats your name on tcp right now antimatroid
2010-11-24T09:01:06  <antimatroid1> that's my upper bound of hope
2010-11-24T09:01:16  <antimatroid1> nothing, was crash bot before
2010-11-24T09:01:22  <antimatroid1> but making changes /fixing things still
2010-11-24T09:01:33  <bhasker> ah k

2010-11-24T09:01:52  <bhasker> hmm did you play against malazan-max
2010-11-24T09:01:59  <Error323_> ah ur not beating me in the last two games :P
2010-11-24T09:02:05  <antimatroid1> i think i did at some point
2010-11-24T09:02:39  <antimatroid1> Error323: i've spend 24 hours debugging crap, it's missing lots of stuff :P
2010-11-24T09:03:51  <bhasker> malazan-max seems to be doing reasonably well on tcp
2010-11-24T09:03:56  <Error323_> bhasker: yep
2010-11-24T09:04:09  <bhasker> its slowly clilmbing the ranks
2010-11-24T09:04:09  <Error323_> is it much better than the version you send me?
2010-11-24T09:04:16  <bhasker> i don't think so
2010-11-24T09:04:20  <bhasker> let me start 0.23 up
2010-11-24T09:04:42  <Error323_> my latest version beats it 110 out of 200
2010-11-24T09:04:47  <bhasker> nice
2010-11-24T09:04:58  <Error323_> and there are about 10 draws iir
2010-11-24T09:05:00  <bhasker> k started up 0.23
2010-11-24T09:07:43  <bhasker> 34 more spots to climb to beat E323-1
2010-11-24T09:08:48  <bhasker> does anyone know whose are these chk* bots?
2010-11-24T09:11:01  <Error323_> don't know
2010-11-24T09:17:54  <antimatroid1> no idea either
2010-11-24T09:18:04  <janzert> mega1: Was there some actual experiment that Accoun did you were referring to? So far as I know he is just making assertions
2010-11-24T09:18:35  <mega1> ... well, it's hard to tell. I assumed he actually tested bots.
2010-11-24T09:18:44  <antimatroid1> i think he's talking about playing bots on tcp
2010-11-24T09:19:02  <antimatroid1> but i could be wrong
2010-11-24T09:19:18  <contestbot> amstan: Error: There was a problem accessing the interface to ai-contest.com
2010-11-24T09:20:39  <janzert> mega1: ok, I've never managed a fruitful discussion with him so, well...
2010-11-24T09:21:21  <antimatroid1> i'm happy for you to just do as you planned
2010-11-24T09:21:53  <bhasker> mega1 you should publish an article on your bot after 27th
2010-11-24T09:21:55  <antimatroid1> i think the more maps the better but other than that, it's fair for everybody before pairings etc.
2010-11-24T09:22:06  <bhasker> we pretty much know for sure that your bot will win this game
2010-11-24T09:22:08  <antimatroid1> :\ why are people always about publishing papers
2010-11-24T09:22:38  <mega1> bhasker: I will if my heart's not broken.
2010-11-24T09:23:05  <mega1> (I thought a blog entry would suffice)
2010-11-24T09:23:12  <bhasker> not a paper antimatroid a simple description of his technique
2010-11-24T09:23:21  <bhasker> cause after spending two months at this problem
2010-11-24T09:23:27  <bhasker> i still can't come close to his bot lol
2010-11-24T09:23:28  <bhasker> :(
2010-11-24T09:23:43  <antimatroid1> ah yeah, blog post is sufficient
2010-11-24T09:25:25  <Error323_> yeah i'm really curious to his works aswell
2010-11-24T09:25:47  <bhasker> are you running any new versions now mega1
2010-11-24T09:26:11  <bhasker> or are you done with your submissions
2010-11-24T09:26:45  <mega1> bhasker: testing things locally, but as I spend more and more time timeouts and cpu power are becoming very effective randomizers
2010-11-24T09:27:31  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-24T09:27:51  <bhasker> i don't understand why we have maps like this http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1186127
2010-11-24T09:27:58  <bhasker> mega1 does your bot draw on such maps
2010-11-24T09:28:01  <mega1> I should go to tcp again in a while and after that to the offical
2010-11-24T09:28:40  <mega1> bhasker: I think so
2010-11-24T09:28:42  <antimatroid1> bhasker: it's hard to eliminate maps like that
2010-11-24T09:28:56  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-24T09:29:19  <antimatroid1> and i think if you waited, you may have been able to claim one of those centre 5 planets, and possible the other one after
2010-11-24T09:30:56  <rabidus> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1178548
2010-11-24T09:31:11  <rabidus> i don't understand why that malazan guy didn't attack when he had a chance
2010-11-24T09:31:34  <bhasker> that would be me rabidus
2010-11-24T09:31:58  <bhasker> hmm i think i don't have enough ships at any point
2010-11-24T09:32:06  <rabidus> yeah, it was open in my browser, opened that few hours ago
2010-11-24T09:32:07  <bhasker> oh wait
2010-11-24T09:32:16  <bhasker> thats because my bot is too conservative
2010-11-24T09:32:24  <bhasker> it won't launch if it can't do it without losing the home planet
2010-11-24T09:32:25  <rabidus> but that's certainly a bug
2010-11-24T09:32:29  <bhasker> rather without losing my planet
2010-11-24T09:32:30  <rabidus> ok
2010-11-24T09:32:37  <bhasker> it doesn't do trades very well
2010-11-24T09:32:58  <bhasker> i haven't ever figured a good way to factor in trades

2010-11-24T09:38:29  <antimatroid1> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1136
2010-11-24T09:39:48  <antimatroid1> it's not a particularly good bot
2010-11-24T09:39:59  <mega1> lavalamp_: it turned out the my new version subtly relied on knowing what the opponent would do
2010-11-24T09:40:19  <mega1> which it knew quite well as it was a slight tweak.
2010-11-24T09:41:16  <cYmen> mega1: So have you written any tutorial, yet? :)
2010-11-24T09:42:15  <janzert> slight tweaks doing exceptionally well against an old version is a quite pervasive problem when working on game ai :(
2010-11-24T09:42:17  <mega1> this time around there seem to be fewer tutorials and
2010-11-24T09:42:26  <mega1> ideas and shared so freely.
2010-11-24T09:42:34  <lavalamp_> mega1: my bot is too stupid to have that problem at the moment :/
2010-11-24T09:42:50  <mega1> I thought so too.
2010-11-24T09:43:30  <lavalamp_> I very slightly improved the things it sucked at, possibly hurting the things it was good at in the process...
2010-11-24T09:44:52  <mega1> west coast got to work too
2010-11-24T09:46:16  <lavalamp_> ok today is probably my last day working on this dumb bot
2010-11-24T09:46:29  <lavalamp_> I leave for a vacation tomorrow
2010-11-24T09:46:41  <antimatroid1> the specifics matter so much in this that i don't mind sharing my general strategy
2010-11-24T09:46:49  <lavalamp_> I actually took off work a day early so I could make last minute changes on this ^^
2010-11-24T09:47:33  <lavalamp_> I'm going to try and get my payoff table engine working with my current bot. Then we'll have to call it good.

2010-11-24T11:40:53  <jshriver> hrm just tried it, works but wasn't sure the "java MyBot "java MyBot" is that where you would put your game executable?
2010-11-24T11:41:07  <JamesMG> yeah
2010-11-24T11:41:15  <jshriver> for example instead of "java MyBot" I could just put "./MyBot.pl" assuming I run it from the directory it is
2010-11-24T11:41:23  <JamesMG> should work

2010-11-24T11:42:00  <jshriver> and does that work for multiple engines?  I tried the above but seems like the second engine just sits there and grows but doesnt attack. If I use the java MyBot or the basic perl mybot
2010-11-24T11:42:25  <jshriver> this game reminds me a lot of risk :
2010-11-24T11:42:26  <jshriver> :)
2010-11-24T11:42:58  <JamesMG> for it to be growing it has to be returning "go" to end it's turns, else it would get a timeout error
2010-11-24T11:43:24  <jshriver> hrm so they must be running
2010-11-24T11:43:35  <jshriver> will have to tinker,. Just found out about this via reddit :) so only have 3 days to code
2010-11-24T11:43:44  <JamesMG> good luck :)
2010-11-24T11:43:48  <jshriver> hopefully they will do this again next year
2010-11-24T11:44:08  <JamesMG> I heard rumors of something in feb, nothing solid though
2010-11-24T11:44:45  <jshriver> nice
2010-11-24T11:45:12  <jshriver> see this is the second year, was the first year the same? If so then people could keep working on it till next year
2010-11-24T11:45:37  <JamesMG> first year was a different game, I wasn't around for it though

2010-11-24T16:43:19  <smloh1> sigh, just had to roll back my latest "improvement"
2010-11-24T16:44:16  <smloh1> i thought it would be a good idea to de-prioritize potential moves further in the future - when things are less certain
2010-11-24T16:44:33  <smloh1> but it just messes up my near-term priorities
2010-11-24T16:45:01  <smloh1> perhaps if i did a kind of plateau-falloff
2010-11-24T16:45:37  <smloh1> just trying to prevent my bot sending things all the way to the other side of the map
2010-11-24T16:45:49  <smloh1> which doesn't turn out to be a good idea by the time the ships get there
2010-11-24T16:46:36  <smloh1> although SOMETIMES it is a good idea
2010-11-24T16:46:41  <Mistmanov> my bot shouldn't have that problem, since it only sends ships when it's absolutely certain that it can conquer a planet, not matter what happens in the meantime (or at least, that's the theory..)
2010-11-24T16:46:59  <Mistmanov> so that normally requires an enormous number of ships, so it will almost never send ships all the way across the map =)
2010-11-24T16:48:04  <smloh1> yeah, my bot thinks it's certain, but i don't think it sufficiently accounts for enemy growth, i.e. new planets that MIGHT be conquered
2010-11-24T16:49:16  <Mistmanov> true, if the enemy has some freakishly efficient expansion, my calculation can also be a bit off
2010-11-24T16:49:31  <Mistmanov> (I can't even do efficient expansion for myself, let alone calculate it for my enemy -_-)
2010-11-24T16:49:59  <smloh1> haha same problem here
2010-11-24T16:50:29  <smloh1> i wonder whether there's a tradeoff between expecting very aggressive expansion and a "safe" expansion from the enemy
2010-11-24T16:51:38  <Mistmanov> it's probably a bit rock-paper-scissory
2010-11-24T16:51:43  <smloh1> but oh well i guess i should just leave that at what works reasonably well for now and try to fix my big problem

2010-11-24T16:52:20  <smloh1> and sometimes sends ships over to defend a planet "for sure" when it doesn't really need to yet

2010-11-24T17:14:09  <Mistmanov> eh..
2010-11-24T17:14:24  <Mistmanov> you mean which planets I can attack?
2010-11-24T17:14:42  <Mistmanov> without danger of them being sniped?
2010-11-24T17:14:44  <bhasker> yea i remember i think it was you or was it medromania
2010-11-24T17:14:45  <bhasker> yes
2010-11-24T17:14:50  <bhasker> oh maybe it wasn't you
2010-11-24T17:14:59  <Mistmanov> good chance :p

2010-11-24T17:16:31  <bhasker> diff = ?
2010-11-24T17:16:36  <bhasker> distance difference?
2010-11-24T17:16:40  <McLeopold> yep
2010-11-24T17:16:55  <McLeopold> positive is extra growth you get before the hit
2010-11-24T17:17:10  <McLeopold> negative is extra growth the enemy gets
2010-11-24T17:17:35  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-24T17:18:01  <bhasker> so basically this checks if the enemy hits it with all 100 ships its a net positive transaction or not?
2010-11-24T17:18:16  <McLeopold> kinda
2010-11-24T17:18:28  <bhasker> hmm

2010-11-24T17:19:13  <McLeopold> basically, you get the growth for the turns you hold it to count toward your eventual defense
2010-11-24T17:19:37  <McLeopold> minus the ships would will lose to neutral forces
2010-11-24T17:19:46  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-11-24T17:20:02  <smloh1> oh so it's like the profit calculation
2010-11-24T17:20:17  <McLeopold> so planets that are equidistant are always bad, unless growth >= num_ships
2010-11-24T17:20:26  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-11-24T17:20:36  <bhasker> thanks let me try that out, i get sniped a lot
2010-11-24T17:20:40  <McLeopold> which is special, because if you both hit, it stays neutral
2010-11-24T17:20:54  <bhasker> so trying to see how my bot does if i remove all planets that are snipable on turn 1
2010-11-24T17:21:03  <McLeopold> it won't do good.
2010-11-24T17:21:07  <bhasker> :(
2010-11-24T17:21:08  <McLeopold> That's most planets
2010-11-24T17:21:17  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-24T17:21:36  <McLeopold> it will be way to conseritive, or always be 1 turn behind

2010-11-24T17:53:20  <bhasker> zeroviz is hosted on mcleopolds home connection
2010-11-24T17:53:26  <bhasker> so you probably don't want to slam it

2010-11-24T17:55:00  <pccc> How come when I set max_num_turns to 200 it runs for 201 turns? Little bug or what?
2010-11-24T17:55:18  <bhasker> lol lot of back and forth http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1193425
2010-11-24T17:55:23  <bhasker> it runs for 200
2010-11-24T17:55:31  <bhasker> the decision is based on the end state of turn 200
2010-11-24T17:55:34  <bhasker> so it shows till 201
2010-11-24T17:55:41  <bhasker> no bug
2010-11-24T17:56:04  <smloh1> so we should be looking at the state at the beginning of turn 201?

2010-11-24T18:55:27  <McLeopold> bhasker: how did you manage that win?
2010-11-24T18:55:55  <bhasker> i split my availabilityQ into two now
2010-11-24T18:55:58  <bhasker> one for attack/defense
2010-11-24T18:56:02  <bhasker> and one for acquiring neutrals
2010-11-24T18:56:21  <bhasker> any ship over minimum required to retain control is available for attack
2010-11-24T18:56:42  <bhasker> when i funnlled to the 5 to the left
2010-11-24T18:56:44  <bhasker> he didnt
2010-11-24T18:57:01  <bhasker> as a result my 5 growth ont he side had enough ships to take his 5
2010-11-24T18:57:08  <bhasker> so we swapped
2010-11-24T18:57:13  <bhasker> and swapped again
2010-11-24T18:57:19  <bhasker> that led to him being behind on ships
2010-11-24T18:57:23  <bhasker> and from there it was over
2010-11-24T18:57:44  <McLeopold> how did you send the 151 if you have a check to maintain control?
2010-11-24T18:57:46  <bhasker> watch Turn 16
2010-11-24T18:57:56  <bhasker> as i said, that check is in place only for acquiring neutrals
2010-11-24T18:58:05  <bhasker> so what i do is i calculate two availability Q's
2010-11-24T18:58:12  <bhasker> one for deciding whether i can acquire neutrals
2010-11-24T18:58:22  <bhasker> and one for whether i can attack/defend stuff
2010-11-24T18:58:38  <bhasker> the second queue has no restrictions except that i can't launch ships that would cause me to lose the planet
2010-11-24T18:58:56  <bhasker> so on turn 16 my bot saw that it had 151 available
2010-11-24T18:59:06  <bhasker> and enemy had only 126

2010-11-24T18:59:08  <bhasker> so it launched
2010-11-24T18:59:18  <bhasker> it worked in this case because planets were equal growth
2010-11-24T18:59:22  <bhasker> but it bites me in the ass
2010-11-24T18:59:31  <bhasker> when i swap from a good to a  bad
2010-11-24T18:59:40  <McLeopold> yeah, that's tricky
2010-11-24T18:59:43  <bhasker> like a 5 growth to a 2growth or something
2010-11-24T19:00:10  <bhasker> also for some reason his bot sent 31 ships
2010-11-24T19:00:10  <bhasker> to the other 5
2010-11-24T19:00:13  <bhasker> at turn 28

2010-11-24T19:02:58  <bhasker> the other thing i have realized most bots freeze up
2010-11-24T19:03:02  <bhasker> if you launch a big fleet at them
2010-11-24T19:03:30  <bhasker> so if you launch from a planet with lots of ships to another one with lots of ships some bots just decide they can't send anything out
2010-11-24T19:03:33  <bhasker> and sit
2010-11-24T19:03:46  <McLeopold> I think I may do that
2010-11-24T19:03:54  <McLeopold> But I consider it a good thing
2010-11-24T19:04:25  <McLeopold> I always want a few ships on the map as possible.

2010-11-24T19:49:15  <McLeopold> no, but that's a good idea

2010-11-24T20:49:56  <zeratul> I think I'm doing fairly well for just starting, but what's a good way to figure out how I'm crashing besides commenting/uncommenting blocks of code until I find where the problem is (since it doesn't happen every game)

2010-11-24T21:20:06  <burny> all your ships are in flight already, or the opponent has no planets, etc.
2010-11-24T21:29:26  <j3camero> So I was thinking some more about my idea for an AI contest... the prediction market. What if we created a market where you could trade YouTube videos? When you buy a video, if it gets more popular, you make money. If you think a video is over-rated you could sell it short.
2010-11-24T21:30:47  <j3camero> Of course, we would have a web interface for this market, sort of like InTrade. We would also have an API so you could connect electronically and make markets and do other high-frequency trading strategies. Maybe a little technical analysis or something. You could also do fundamental trades where your program goes and queries the latest amount of views and trades based off of that.

2010-11-24T21:32:10  <j3camero> Seems to me like trading YouTube videos as if they were stocks would be lots of fun. Also, it would generate predictions about which videos are going to rise in popularity and which are going to fall.
2010-11-24T21:35:43  <antimatroid1> i like the idea of working out some kind of virtual information market
2010-11-24T21:35:51  <antimatroid1> where the bots interact and it's all handled inside that
2010-11-24T21:36:03  <antimatroid1> i'll put more thought into it after this week, i'm flat out trying to get the bot done
2010-11-24T21:37:59  <pyro-> there's no possibility of automatically predicting the popularity of a video based on its content. you can only judge via its existing popularity. so it might as well be any virtual resource
2010-11-24T21:38:06  <sjl> is a "no-op" move illegal?

2010-11-24T21:41:30  <Zannick> the latter is illegal, the former is ignored, i believe
2010-11-24T21:41:58  <sjl> As in, when asked for actions by the game engine, send "go\n" and nothing else.
2010-11-24T21:42:32  <sjl> maybe "move" is the wrong term... how about "a no-op turn"?
2010-11-24T21:42:39  <Zannick> those are legal
2010-11-24T21:42:48  <sjl> hrm
2010-11-24T21:43:16  <sjl> the PlayGame.jar seems to think I've timed out when I just send "go\n"
2010-11-24T21:46:44  <j3camero> Are you using the starter package?
2010-11-24T21:46:52  <sjl> Yep, the java one
2010-11-24T21:46:59  <j3camero> If not, remember to do stdout.flush() after sending "go\n"
2010-11-24T21:47:11  <sjl> Though I'm very new to Clojure, so it's entirely possibly that I'm borking something somewhere.

2010-11-24T21:48:58  <j3camero> The engine, as in PlayGame.jar?
2010-11-24T21:49:03  <burny> ya
2010-11-24T21:49:11  <j3camero> It does.
2010-11-24T21:49:32  <j3camero> But the client program (your bot) also has to flush every time it sends output to the engine as well.
2010-11-24T21:50:15  <j3camero> Otherwise your instructions just sit in a buffer in your program's memory instead of actually being sent to the engine. So your engine waits around for 1000 milliseconds, gets nothing, then kicks your bot out of the game.

2010-11-24T22:40:03  <janzert> afk again for a while, I'll get it on the server later
2010-11-24T22:40:26  <dmj111> antimatroid1: mostly done.  trying a few things, but I don't want to submit the last day or two if I can help it.
2010-11-24T22:40:44  <antimatroid1> hehe, it's going to be my first submission in weeks
2010-11-24T22:40:50  <antimatroid1> i plan to get one up at least tomorrow
2010-11-24T22:41:07  <antimatroid1> that way i have a couple of days to try and fix things worst comes to worst
2010-11-24T22:41:13  <dmj111> that'll be good :)
2010-11-24T22:41:32  <dmj111> that's is kind of my plan too.  the time for big changes is done, I think.  Spent enough time on this already.
2010-11-24T22:41:43  <antimatroid1> i'm still implementing a few big things
2010-11-24T22:41:50  <antimatroid1> but the strategy is sound so should be alright i think
2010-11-24T22:42:12  <antimatroid1> i'm putting in a last ditch all or nothing effort :P
2010-11-24T22:42:46  <Zannick> janzert: no problem, just ping me if you need anything more
2010-11-24T22:42:50  <antimatroid1> atm it's beating iouri, accoun and baron etc. sometimes, but making some stupid moves at other times
2010-11-24T22:42:54  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to remove the stupid
2010-11-24T22:43:12  <dmj111> everytime i try to remove the stupid, I put more back in.
2010-11-24T22:43:33  <antimatroid1> hehe, like i said, all or nothing :)
2010-11-24T22:44:11  <dmj111> one bad thing is my bot is starting to like 200 turn games.  bad for testing, bad for the server for the final tournament.  oh, and boring.
2010-11-24T22:44:24  <antimatroid1> my bot likes fast games :)
2010-11-24T22:44:55  <antimatroid1> we realised yesterday that it's a prisoners dilemma about whether you should rape your resources for the full second
2010-11-24T22:45:03  <antimatroid1> i shall cooperate, but i really think that needs to be fixed
2010-11-24T22:45:06  <antimatroid1> in the future
2010-11-24T22:45:21  <burny> I'm gona add some code that if my bot has more regen, and is above a 5growth lead, to turn into 'end the game' mode
2010-11-24T22:45:33  <antimatroid1> burny: have you done future states yet?
2010-11-24T22:45:37  <burny> no
2010-11-24T22:45:44  <antimatroid1> that will get you the biggest improvement for something you could do in a couple of days
2010-11-24T22:45:51  <burny> clearly
2010-11-24T22:50:04  <dmj111> the code i use at home runs the bots one at a time.  if both crash, draw, but if one crashes, it loses.
2010-11-24T22:50:19  <dmj111> since I am on a crappy old computer...
2010-11-24T22:52:33  <burny> know what might be more interesting then a graph of number of turns vs rank?... match duration vs rank

2010-11-24T23:30:00  <janzert> anyone have a bot written in java that could use a few packages to test it out?
