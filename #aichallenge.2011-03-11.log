2011-03-11T00:00:28  <McLeopold> https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/game.py
2011-03-11T00:00:32  <McLeopold> look at that stub class
2011-03-11T00:00:42  <McLeopold> That's the "interface"
2011-03-11T00:01:02  *** antimatroid <antimatroid!~Nick@181.202.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has left #aichallenge
2011-03-11T00:01:05  <McLeopold> The engine excepts all of those function to exist, regardless of the game being played
2011-03-11T00:01:17  <sigh> ah, Ants is supposed to inherit from this?
2011-03-11T00:01:30  <McLeopold> Well, it could, but in python there is no point.
2011-03-11T00:01:45  <sigh> I would do it for documentation purposes, if nothing else
2011-03-11T00:01:45  <McLeopold> I could put a raise error in the base class.
2011-03-11T00:01:56  <McLeopold> so you have to override them all
2011-03-11T00:02:01  <amstan_> why is this in the ants folder then? should be outside somewhere..
2011-03-11T00:02:12  <McLeopold> amstan_: geeze, give me time
2011-03-11T00:02:17  <sigh> haha
2011-03-11T00:02:34  <sigh> when I see something like that Game, I generally search the repo for places where it is used
2011-03-11T00:03:00  <sigh> so if I didn't find it, I would be confused... or afraid of some scary meta-programming
2011-03-11T00:03:11  <sigh> :P
2011-03-11T00:03:20  <McLeopold> So I'm liking the work you did now, so let's go with it.
2011-03-11T00:03:56  <sigh> cool :)
2011-03-11T00:04:00  <McLeopold> But, I think it would be appropriate to nit-pick the do_attack and do_spawn functions, because everyone will be referring to them
2011-03-11T00:04:38  *** antimatroid <antimatroid!~Nick@181.202.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-11T00:04:43  <sigh> oh... before that... one nit-pick about code
2011-03-11T00:04:58  <McLeopold> If we could get the data structure to it's own class, so the attack, spawn, food and score are the only thing in the Ants class, that would be great for helping people understand it
2011-03-11T00:05:01  <sigh> why do you prefer to keep row, col separate rather than in a tuple?
2011-03-11T00:05:19  <McLeopold> I don't know.
2011-03-11T00:05:34  <McLeopold> Fear that unpacking would be a performance hit?
2011-03-11T00:05:45  <sigh> hehe
2011-03-11T00:06:11  <sigh> it's better to pack it into a tuple, because then most places in the code don't need to know about the internals
2011-03-11T00:06:14  <McLeopold> I would make sense to just use a tuple, so people that use languages with vectors and point classes can read it better
2011-03-11T00:06:37  <sigh> for example, switching form (col,row) to (row,col) would have been easier :P
2011-03-11T00:06:58  <McLeopold> I think I went back and forth, and my distaste for [0] at the end of variables all the time won. :)
2011-03-11T00:07:29  <sigh> oh, that's easy to fix... just do row,col = location if you need it explicitly
2011-03-11T00:07:41  <sigh> better yet reduce the number of places where it is needed explicitly
2011-03-11T00:07:50  <McLeopold> yeah, and I do that anyway in the code all over the place, so I really have no excuse
2011-03-11T00:07:56  <sigh> :)
2011-03-11T00:08:29  <sigh> and it makes thing that much easier if we decide to go 3d or something :D
2011-03-11T00:08:42  <McLeopold> So, the new food spawning makes my test runs a lot slower.
2011-03-11T00:09:01  <McLeopold> I can't tell if it is just extra ants, or the engine.  And I haven't really looked at it yet.
2011-03-11T00:09:03  <sigh> yeah... it's hard to get much faster than random
2011-03-11T00:09:20  <McLeopold> I shouldn't be
2011-03-11T00:10:13  <sigh> in general we are keeping more data now, but I don't think I did anything terribly inefficient
2011-03-11T00:10:36  <McLeopold> in the food code, what is bfs?
2011-03-11T00:10:49  <sigh> breadth-first search
2011-03-11T00:10:59  <sigh> really, the offset-code should not be using it
2011-03-11T00:11:17  <sigh> but it's required for the section-code
2011-03-11T00:11:37  <McLeopold> so in sections, you just create lists for each player that are cached, then food spawning should be just as fast as random
2011-03-11T00:11:49  <sigh> hmm...yeah
2011-03-11T00:12:16  <McLeopold> We need a mechanism to control the food spawned per turn
2011-03-11T00:12:16  <sigh> meh, need to profile the thing
2011-03-11T00:12:29  <sigh> control in what way?
2011-03-11T00:12:56  <McLeopold> so, if it is 3 per turn, and there are 5 bots, then spawn 5 every so often
2011-03-11T00:13:03  <sigh> oh... I just realised
2011-03-11T00:13:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i get this when I try to get the visualiser thing going
2011-03-11T00:13:18  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/7NgZnmww
2011-03-11T00:13:19  <McLeopold> which means, we don't need to spawn every turn
2011-03-11T00:13:25  <sigh> my food spawning will spawn a lot more food by default than before I messed with it
2011-03-11T00:13:31  <sigh> like num_players times more
2011-03-11T00:13:34  <antimatroid> the browser shows the map with start positions, but i get nothing after that
2011-03-11T00:13:40  <sigh> which means a lot more ants => more run times
2011-03-11T00:14:20  <McLeopold> antimatroid: the replay file is being loaded by javascript, which is why you need the python http server in the first place
2011-03-11T00:14:35  <McLeopold> look at the script in firebug to see what the file is that it is requesting
2011-03-11T00:14:45  <sigh> antimatroid: press arrow keys in browser
2011-03-11T00:14:48  <McLeopold> you should be able to hit it in your browser
2011-03-11T00:14:52  <McLeopold> oh, that :P
2011-03-11T00:14:58  <antimatroid> that'll do it :)
2011-03-11T00:15:08  <antimatroid> cheers :)
2011-03-11T00:15:39  <McLeopold> I should try to see if Frontier's works
2011-03-11T00:16:04  <sigh> has Frontier got something that conforms to the new format?
2011-03-11T00:16:10  <McLeopold> maybe
2011-03-11T00:16:29  <sigh> I purposely kept the current output as is, and just wrote to *.replay.new
2011-03-11T00:16:42  <McLeopold> That's fine for now
2011-03-11T00:16:50  <McLeopold> I'll add parser options later
2011-03-11T00:17:04  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-11T00:17:24  <McLeopold> also, I made some changes to my version of ants, so I'm going to need to merge
2011-03-11T00:17:33  <McLeopold> and I'm scared.
2011-03-11T00:17:36  <sigh> haha
2011-03-11T00:18:30  <McLeopold> actually, I pushed it
2011-03-11T00:19:53  <sigh> btw, is it easy to make the bots take a --seed argument or something? I added one to playgame in a hope to make reproducible tests, but failed because the bot are still random
2011-03-11T00:19:59  <sigh> ?
2011-03-11T00:20:40  <McLeopold> well, that's up to the bot owner
2011-03-11T00:20:48  <McLeopold> but our example ones can
2011-03-11T00:20:58  <McLeopold> I was going to change Hunter to not be random
2011-03-11T00:20:59  <amstan_> that should have been set before we started making the tournament engine and the starter packages
2011-03-11T00:21:24  <sigh> oh... can we pass seed as a parameter?
2011-03-11T00:21:34  <sigh> at the start of the game?
2011-03-11T00:21:35  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-11T00:21:41  <sigh> it can be ignored by the bots if they like
2011-03-11T00:21:52  <sigh> but it is great for testing for those who want it
2011-03-11T00:22:00  <McLeopold> let's add it
2011-03-11T00:22:05  <sigh> ok, I'll do it
2011-03-11T00:22:24  <McLeopold> playerSeed n seed, for the replay
2011-03-11T00:22:39  <sigh> meh, give them all the same seed
2011-03-11T00:22:43  <McLeopold> or, 1 seed to rule them all?
2011-03-11T00:22:53  <sigh> yeah, no reason not to
2011-03-11T00:24:14  <McLeopold> okay, I'm heads down in worker.py right now.
2011-03-11T00:31:43  <McLeopold> janzert: you here?
2011-03-11T00:32:29  <McLeopold> I'm curious about the compiling sandbox/jail
2011-03-11T00:42:54  <antimatroid> can there be a specified seed that means no food is to be spawned at all?
2011-03-11T00:43:27  <antimatroid> that way people can test on a map they set up without worrying about food spawning

2011-03-11T00:55:25  <sigh> antimatroid: that doesn't make sense, that functionality seems orthogonal to what the seed does
2011-03-11T00:55:29  <McLeopold> antimatroid: why?
2011-03-11T00:55:55  <McLeopold> like, a map with food already there?
2011-03-11T00:56:16  <McLeopold> I'd rather have a food_spawn option of none
2011-03-11T00:58:39  <sigh> anyway, I've implemented the seed in the engine and the python bots if someone wants to pull: https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge
2011-03-11T00:58:49  <sigh> you can now run deterministic games :)
2011-03-11T00:59:07  <sigh> I'll update the spec, I suppose
2011-03-11T01:01:31  <McLeopold> sigh: I'll pull sometime tomorrow
2011-03-11T01:03:13  <antimatroid> McLeopold: a food_spawn option of none would do
2011-03-11T01:03:33  <antimatroid> the map may/may not have food, but it'd be useful for testing to see if your bot is behaving as you want
2011-03-11T01:03:40  <antimatroid> without food spawning mucking it up
2011-03-11T01:11:20  <sigh> hmmm... I have a bug

2011-03-11T01:33:40  <sigh> oh I fixed it, it was in my conflict resolution
2011-03-11T01:34:05  <sigh> I suppose mostly because the bots I was testing with never issued conflicts :P
2011-03-11T01:35:35  <antimatroid> my bot on there will give you conflicts :P

2011-03-11T09:07:27  <antimatroid> are we still having a maximum of 26 players?
2011-03-11T09:07:33  <antimatroid> otherwise we need to get rid of the char maps
2011-03-11T09:25:25  <aerique> i've written my bot to account for 99 players currently :)
2011-03-11T09:26:06  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm trying to work out how to change mine
2011-03-11T09:26:11  <antimatroid> it gets a bit messier
2011-03-11T09:31:34  <aerique> internally i'm using an array of integers for representing the map, chars didn't seem ideal
2011-03-11T09:32:27  <Naktibalda> why?
2011-03-11T09:33:16  <aerique> Naktibalda: for one, the problem antimatroid just mentioned
2011-03-11T09:33:59  <Naktibalda> ah, a player code
2011-03-11T09:52:44  <antimatroid> aerique: what is your code for dead ants?
2011-03-11T09:53:00  <antimatroid> and how are you planning to handle colliding ants?
2011-03-11T09:53:20  <antimatroid> i can't think of a way that isn't messy as hell
2011-03-11T09:53:21  <Naktibalda> when is the official start of a challenge?
2011-03-11T09:53:32  <antimatroid> when everything is ready :P
2011-03-11T09:53:44  <aerique> I just followed the wiki and am using lowercase for a live ant and uppercase for a dead one when printing the map to terminal.
2011-03-11T09:53:54  <Naktibalda> you have unfair advantage :)
2011-03-11T09:54:18  <aerique> I haven't even thought about colliding ants.  Just finished the most basic sample bot :)
2011-03-11T09:54:54  <aerique> I'm hoping to work on some other (non-challenge) projects before the challenge starts.
2011-03-11T09:57:08  <|UncleVasya|> Naktibalda: I asked about this yesterday and answers were from 3 to 4 weeks.
2011-03-11T09:57:27  <Naktibalda> thanks
2011-03-11T09:57:47  <antimatroid> aerique: i'm thinking about how i will represent stuff myself

2011-03-11T11:30:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: if we're to be passed info for ants that have collided, can the line identifier be different to those who died from battle?
2011-03-11T11:33:07  <McLeopold> hi
2011-03-11T11:33:24  <antimatroid> hi :)
2011-03-11T11:33:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it doesn't matter
2011-03-11T11:33:28  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@ca60c171.ugent.be> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2011-03-11T11:33:36  <antimatroid> it does for the programmer
2011-03-11T11:33:37  <McLeopold> the dead ants will be at the same location, if you need to know
2011-03-11T11:34:02  <antimatroid> yes, the point is having to deal with knowing if more than one dead ant line was given for the same square
2011-03-11T11:34:05  <McLeopold> and they will have the same owner
2011-03-11T11:34:09  <antimatroid> and tehn accounting for a potential 3rd etc.
2011-03-11T11:34:31  <McLeopold> there will be multiple dead ant lines for the same square
2011-03-11T11:34:36  <antimatroid> and assuming one can play around with the attack radius, it could not be from the same owner
2011-03-11T11:34:54  <McLeopold> so were good then with what we have
2011-03-11T11:34:54  <antimatroid> yes, and it's extra code to work out whether you got those extra lines
2011-03-11T11:35:10  <antimatroid> it'd be easy to just ignore that information if it was given as a conflict death
2011-03-11T11:35:17  <Naktibalda> is it possible that attack range > visibility range?
2011-03-11T11:35:19  <antimatroid> as conflict deaths are useless information imo
2011-03-11T11:35:30  <McLeopold> Naktibalda: no, we won't do that
2011-03-11T11:35:49  <antimatroid> McLeopold: my issue isn't that it isn't possible to work the information out, i just don't like having so much implicit information
2011-03-11T11:36:16  <antimatroid> i'd rather everything was told explicitly, i can compromise on food information being semi implicit in order to reduce input size, but this doesn't change input size?
2011-03-11T11:36:27  <McLeopold> It is explicit info, dead ants that died on the same square died from conflict
2011-03-11T11:36:48  <antimatroid> yes, but it's implicit in that to differentiate it from an ant that died from a battle, you have to work it out yourself
2011-03-11T11:36:50  <McLeopold> Food is given every turn, btw
2011-03-11T11:36:56  <antimatroid> you don't know that information when you receive the line
2011-03-11T11:37:22  <antimatroid> food is given every turn, but if you go out of range of a food square and it's land when you come back in view, you only know implicitly that it's not there
2011-03-11T11:37:28  <antimatroid> hence there is implicit information there as well
2011-03-11T11:38:21  <antimatroid> couldn't one just receive 'c' instead of 'd' for a collided ant death line?
2011-03-11T11:39:52  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'd rather not change it.  Maybe wait for jeff to come around again, then spend your effort convincing him of battle option 1?
2011-03-11T11:40:46  <antimatroid> i will, i was just thinking about how to represent stuff, and it's already quite messy
2011-03-11T11:40:55  <antimatroid> dealing with all the implicit information makes it even messier
2011-03-11T11:41:21  <antimatroid> i want to move away from using char maps even in the starter packs
2011-03-11T11:41:33  <antimatroid> because that limits anything to not breaking the starter bots to 26 players
2011-03-11T11:41:41  <McLeopold> Yeah, for input parsing, just make a little temp hash table of death locations, then flip your "attack/conflict" bit when you get a collision.  It's not too messy.
2011-03-11T11:42:23  <McLeopold> Hey, it's an ant collision *and* a hash table collision!
2011-03-11T11:42:24  <antimatroid> hmm, i might have to create a separate structure just for passing input :
2011-03-11T11:42:54  <McLeopold> I don't think we will get above 26 bots.
2011-03-11T11:43:07  <antimatroid> not even on crazy tcp? :(
2011-03-11T11:43:29  <McLeopold> Not if I want to surf the net in the next 2 months. :)
2011-03-11T11:43:50  <antimatroid> nah, have an official crazy maps tcp on the official servers
2011-03-11T11:44:26  <antimatroid> it'd be an effort to get that many people in a game on the other tcp servers
2011-03-11T11:44:53  <McLeopold> so, lower and upper case, 52 players?
2011-03-11T11:45:02  <antimatroid> upper case is dead ant
2011-03-11T11:45:50  <antimatroid> if you move away from char maps, people can pretty much use any number of players
2011-03-11T11:46:02  <antimatroid> i guess we're restriced by map files
2011-03-11T11:46:11  <antimatroid> so it's safe to assume we'll stay <=26 players
2011-03-11T11:46:26  <Naktibalda> where is it described?
2011-03-11T11:46:33  <antimatroid> the game?
2011-03-11T11:46:38  <Naktibalda> I thought that owner is integer, not character
2011-03-11T11:46:56  <antimatroid> it is for input
2011-03-11T11:47:02  <antimatroid> but the map files are char maps
2011-03-11T11:47:14  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-11T11:47:19  <antimatroid> the specs page is there
2011-03-11T11:48:00  <janzert> McLeopold: did you figure out whatever you were wondering last night?
2011-03-11T11:48:44  <antimatroid> McLeopold: how hard would it be to change it so that dead ant info was explicitly different when reading?
2011-03-11T11:48:57  <antimatroid> surely you agree that explicit information is better than implicit where possible?
2011-03-11T11:49:32  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-11T11:51:43  <McLeopold> janzert: how easy is the zeta sandboxing to use?
2011-03-11T11:51:57  <janzert> no idea, haven't even looked at it

2011-03-11T13:16:09  <McLeopold> janzert: you wanted to redo the submission statuses, right?
2011-03-11T13:17:32  <janzert> Anywhere a check for an error status is done would be trivial if all error statuses were strictly larger than non-error statuses :}
2011-03-11T13:17:46  <janzert> with the current codes that is *almost* already the case
2011-03-11T13:18:42  <McLeopold> and before ready to run?
2011-03-11T13:19:07  <janzert> looks at status list, basically if 30 and 40 were transposed it would be fine I think
2011-03-11T13:20:13  <McLeopold> I don't think we need 10, 15, 27, 30 or 60
2011-03-11T13:20:44  <janzert> probably don't need all of them anyway
2011-03-11T13:20:44  <McLeopold> there is no need to create a database entry if we don't get a successful upload
2011-03-11T13:21:26  <janzert> you do need a unique submission id before you can attempt to move the upload into its final place though right?
2011-03-11T13:21:47  <McLeopold> yes, but at that point, we've got a file, so it will be status 20
2011-03-11T13:22:23  <janzert> ok
2011-03-11T13:22:30  <janzert> well, no
2011-03-11T13:22:59  <janzert> 20 is after it has been moved to the final destination on the main server and is ready for a worker to grab and compile
2011-03-11T13:23:27  <McLeopold> yeah, but I'm removing 10 and 15
2011-03-11T13:23:29  <janzert> or I suppose the very initial status could be null, but that seems rather ugly
2011-03-11T13:24:08  <janzert> I'd think you want 10 initially, then 20 once you moved it into the correct location
2011-03-11T13:24:37  <McLeopold> yeah, but I don't see stuff getting stuck in 10 unless we have serious issues with the main server.
2011-03-11T13:25:31  <McLeopold> so, we had 2 tournament managers on the workers to keep the cpu's busy?
2011-03-11T13:25:57  <janzert> it shouldn't, but you have a race if the initial database entry says the submission is in place before it really is
2011-03-11T13:26:00  <janzert> yes

2011-03-11T13:26:24  <McLeopold> okay, I'm trying to get the worker to just use 1 script right now.  It's looking nice so far.
2011-03-11T13:27:02  <McLeopold> Then we could use threads and calc a load value
2011-03-11T13:27:13  <McLeopold> because games will have different number of bots
2011-03-11T13:27:16  <janzert> hmm, ok
2011-03-11T13:27:26  <janzert> except the bots are run in sequence right?
2011-03-11T13:27:43  <janzert> so you should always just assign one core per game
2011-03-11T13:27:44  <McLeopold> not yet, :)  but yes
2011-03-11T13:28:22  <McLeopold> I forget how the jail users were used.  One per worker script?
2011-03-11T13:28:35  <janzert> one per bot running

2011-03-11T13:29:37  <janzert> i.e. each bot runs under its own temporarily dedicated jail user
2011-03-11T13:30:07  <McLeopold> oh yeah
2011-03-11T13:30:17  <McLeopold> plus compiles, if we can sandbox them
2011-03-11T13:30:23  <janzert> right
2011-03-11T13:30:38  <McLeopold> so, each worker can create/verify it's own jail users, then there is no database?
2011-03-11T13:31:16  <janzert> well there is a permanent pool of jail users
2011-03-11T13:31:29  <McLeopold> that's why I said verify
2011-03-11T13:31:41  <McLeopold> but each can have it's own pool
2011-03-11T13:31:46  <janzert> there just needs to be a way of assigning them without going through a database
2011-03-11T13:31:50  <janzert> yes, you could
2011-03-11T13:32:07  <McLeopold> so we start a worker like this "worker.py -t -n0 -id 1"
2011-03-11T13:32:13  <janzert> but it means each worker needs a pool as larger as the largest number of players in a game
2011-03-11T13:32:20  <McLeopold> and it looks for jail_users assigned to id 1
2011-03-11T13:32:38  <McLeopold> so, is a few hundred jail users a big deal?
2011-03-11T13:32:44  <janzert> s/as larger as/as large as/
2011-03-11T13:33:44  <janzert> it seems uglier than running a database to me but
2011-03-11T13:33:46  * janzert shrugs
2011-03-11T13:34:08  <McLeopold> if all the workers are going at full capacity, then you need that many anyway
2011-03-11T13:34:27  <janzert> actually we'll run into memory issues before that
2011-03-11T13:34:42  <janzert> I was thinking about that a bit last night
2011-03-11T13:35:05  <McLeopold> hmm... how much can each bot allocate?  do we quota them?
2011-03-11T13:35:35  <janzert> Ec2 high cpu like we used last time except the larger instance, with 8 cores has 7GB
2011-03-11T13:35:55  <janzert> we had a problem last time trying to limit java to use 1GB(?)
2011-03-11T13:36:10  <McLeopold> with an average of 4 users, that's 32 bot processes at a time
2011-03-11T13:36:24  <McLeopold> wait, sequential,
2011-03-11T13:36:32  <McLeopold> but we still need the memory
2011-03-11T13:37:06  <janzert> right, even if we get sequential execution we'll quickly run into memory problems :(
2011-03-11T13:38:05  <McLeopold> well, for now, I'll make each worker instance manage it's own jail users
2011-03-11T13:38:20  <janzert> we could go to a high memory instance and get 34GB with 4 cores
2011-03-11T13:38:31  <McLeopold> that might be better
2011-03-11T13:38:40  <janzert> faster cores than the high cpu instance too
2011-03-11T13:38:59  <janzert> but the price per core is double
2011-03-11T13:39:16  <McLeopold> we can get one of each and see what does better
2011-03-11T13:44:19  <jmcarthur> if we get faster cores we might be able to get away with cutting down the turn time limit a bit
2011-03-11T13:48:55  <janzert> especially if the slower core machine started swapping bots out to disk :P

2011-03-11T14:30:06  <McLeopold> janzert: for the functional test, 10 turns on a small map with a starter bot?
2011-03-11T14:30:52  <janzert> sure, that should be sufficient.
2011-03-11T14:31:04  <janzert> well, multiple opponents at least
2011-03-11T14:31:14  <McLeopold> why?
2011-03-11T14:31:58  <janzert> to be sure it can handle it, although I guess with fog of war its less likely to actually get to a spot it matters
2011-03-11T14:32:01  <jmcarthur> i'd say it doesn't even need *any* opponents, really
2011-03-11T14:32:15  <jmcarthur> well, okay, i guess it'd be good to have one
2011-03-11T14:32:16  <janzert> I was actually planning on not running it in a real game
2011-03-11T14:32:33  <janzert> just sending it the initial state and make sure it responded with a valid move
2011-03-11T14:32:52  <janzert> I think that would catch a good majority of the crashers
2011-03-11T14:32:54  <McLeopold> right, but it needs to respond 10 times :)
2011-03-11T14:33:06  <janzert> but playing out 10 turns is even better of course
2011-03-11T14:33:16  <Zannick> that was my idea, too, janzert
2011-03-11T14:33:32  <McLeopold> And if I set the map up correctly, I can get the starter bot to attack it.
2011-03-11T14:33:33  <Zannick> but with multiple test cases, rather than one test case with multiple turns
2011-03-11T14:34:28  <McLeopold> Zannick, it would be unfair to give them vastly different states each turn.
2011-03-11T14:34:46  <Zannick> it would be new games each time
2011-03-11T14:34:55  <Zannick> which is not the most efficient, of course
2011-03-11T14:35:10  <McLeopold> I think a small map with 1 opponent with a senario including spawn and attack is just fine.
2011-03-11T14:35:16  <janzert> also if it does send an invalid move or crash in the tests the output should be sent in the failure email
2011-03-11T14:35:54  <McLeopold> I'm attempting to capture stderr, and logging bad moves.
2011-03-11T14:36:18  * janzert nods
2011-03-11T14:36:43  <McLeopold> janzert: if you have time, look at worker.py, which I just pushed up
2011-03-11T14:36:54  <McLeopold> The compile stuff is really messy, as I tried not to touch it.
2011-03-11T14:37:03  <McLeopold> and nothing is using jail users yet
2011-03-11T14:37:10  <Zannick> the workers should do the emailing, in that case, rather than pass stderr and stdout logs around
2011-03-11T14:37:27  <janzert> Zannick: yes
2011-03-11T14:37:45  <McLeopold> For real games, it will pass stderr back to the database.
2011-03-11T14:37:58  <janzert> does one worker.py run per core then?
2011-03-11T14:37:59  <Zannick> you have to be careful in that case
2011-03-11T14:38:07  <janzert> or per server
2011-03-11T14:38:09  <Zannick> repr is probably sufficient, though
2011-03-11T14:38:30  <McLeopold> janzert: when I get the jail users going, we should be able to spin up multiples per server
2011-03-11T14:39:09  <McLeopold> Zannick: 1024 byes only and only on a timeout/crash.
2011-03-11T14:39:24  <janzert> btw for security reasons I think Jeff was opposed to giving bot output directly back to the developers before
2011-03-11T14:39:28  <Zannick> McLeopold: i meant in terms of injection attacks
2011-03-11T14:39:36  <janzert> personally I'm not quite as worried about it
2011-03-11T14:39:39  <Zannick> like i said, repr ought to take care of that
2011-03-11T14:39:49  <McLeopold> Zannick, yes, we'll stripe everything but alpha and numbers :)
2011-03-11T14:40:14  <Zannick> ...that works too, i guess :)
2011-03-11T14:40:18  <McLeopold> janzert: like if they tried to get system info?
2011-03-11T14:40:23  <janzert> right
2011-03-11T14:40:29  <McLeopold> I hadn't thought of that
2011-03-11T14:40:46  <Zannick> huh
2011-03-11T14:41:01  <McLeopold> we could at least capture it, then give it out if asked for?
2011-03-11T14:41:17  <janzert> if they get sensitive information with their bot currently it's a bit harder for them to make use of it
2011-03-11T14:41:38  <janzert> have to encoded it in the way their bot plays :)
2011-03-11T14:42:11  <janzert> so if you see ants spelling out ascii characters, quickly suspend that submission
2011-03-11T14:42:15  <Zannick> yeah, if someone were able to grab the jail user's private key and communicate it to them...
2011-03-11T14:42:33  <janzert> jail user's don't have a key anymore
2011-03-11T14:42:49  <Zannick> oh
2011-03-11T14:42:53  <janzert> but yeah that's the general idea
2011-03-11T14:43:32  <McLeopold> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code
2011-03-11T14:43:56  <janzert> what is the get_languages api supposed to be used for?
2011-03-11T14:45:22  <McLeopold> to get the language info from the database
2011-03-11T14:45:27  <McLeopold> compile_anything needs the info
2011-03-11T14:45:29  <janzert> ahh, I see it's a request of the languages table basically
2011-03-11T14:45:43  <McLeopold> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_matrix_(computer)
2011-03-11T14:45:50  <McLeopold> okay, that barcode is better
2011-03-11T14:46:25  <McLeopold> I'm sure I could come up with a bar code over time system for getting info.
2011-03-11T14:46:50  <janzert> hmm, what does compile_anything need of it?
2011-03-11T14:46:56  <janzert> I was thinking the worker might need it for the command line to actually run currently
2011-03-11T14:47:11  <janzert> and I was hoping to move that out of the database actually
2011-03-11T14:47:23  <Zannick> the language data should be moved out of the database
2011-03-11T14:47:37  <Zannick> this is the plan (and i believe is implemented) for zeta
2011-03-11T14:48:24  <McLeopold> janzert: just the list of langauge main files, right now
2011-03-11T14:49:02  <janzert> ok, should be good for now I suppose. hopefully we have time to get rid of it later
2011-03-11T14:49:12  <McLeopold> languages are in the database so we can tag a submission, and do the per language rankings
2011-03-11T14:49:38  <McLeopold> so, it needs a list so it can report back to the server the correct id
2011-03-11T14:49:56  <McLeopold> which means you can't take it out, even in zeta
2011-03-11T14:49:57  <janzert> just report the language name back
2011-03-11T14:50:04  <janzert> let the server map that to an id
2011-03-11T14:50:19  <McLeopold> why bother?  just put the data in the database
2011-03-11T14:50:42  <McLeopold> what's the goal of removing it?
2011-03-11T14:50:44  <janzert> because it doesn't belong in the database :)
2011-03-11T14:50:51  <janzert> it's not something that should change
2011-03-11T14:50:57  <McLeopold> but it is
2011-03-11T14:51:02  <McLeopold> we add languages
2011-03-11T14:51:04  <janzert> it's constant data
2011-03-11T14:51:14  <janzert> yes but each language is fixed
2011-03-11T14:51:32  <McLeopold> you don't take constant data out of databases
2011-03-11T14:51:36  <McLeopold> that doesn't make sense
2011-03-11T14:51:40  <Zannick> we can keep the language, id stuff in the database
2011-03-11T14:51:52  <McLeopold> every table doesn't need to be volitile
2011-03-11T14:51:53  <Zannick> the point is that the compile scripts don't need to access the database
2011-03-11T14:52:15  <McLeopold> zannick: correct, thus the api_get_languages.php

2011-03-11T14:53:51  <janzert> your schema still shows the execution command as stored in the database though
2011-03-11T14:54:05  <janzert> and the main code file
2011-03-11T14:55:13  <janzert> the language table should just be a name and id
2011-03-11T14:55:30  <janzert> ideally, eventually that is :/
2011-03-11T14:55:56  <McLeopold> ok, so pass around language names then
2011-03-11T15:00:49  <janzert> the main server always just hands out the original submission archive (zip/tar.gz/tgz) right?
2011-03-11T15:01:14  <janzert> if that is the case clean_old_submission can just be dropped entirely

2011-03-11T15:04:02  <Zannick> i agree with the comment that starter pack structure should be changed
2011-03-11T15:04:12  <Zannick> i think we decided that we'd have the bot separate from the tools
2011-03-11T15:06:41  <janzert> when running a game task, before starting the game the manager needs to make sure all the players are already downloaded and compiled
2011-03-11T15:09:38  <janzert> i.e. the equivalent of ensure_submission_is_local in the old manager
2011-03-11T15:10:34  <janzert> go ahead and drop the use of the platform_specific_compilation flag though, it just adds complexity for little benefit
2011-03-11T15:13:45  <McLeopold> janzert: I haven't really touched the game_task yet, it's just a stub.

2011-03-11T15:14:07  <McLeopold> I do want to add proper logging
2011-03-11T15:14:39  <McLeopold> and cleanup_old is used because my test system has planet_wars zip files right now. :)
2011-03-11T15:15:36  <McLeopold> janzert: Also, I don't want to touch the compile code at all.  I'm just refactoring it a little to work with the new worker.
2011-03-11T15:16:03  <McLeopold> I think maybe the old manager used popen for sandboxing the compile?
2011-03-11T15:26:27  <janzert> it didn't sandbox the compile at all
2011-03-11T15:26:38  <janzert> so far as I recall anyway
2011-03-11T15:29:08  <jmcarthur> i oppose stuff like compilation commands being in the database because it makes it impossible for anybody to see them or contribute new ones via git
2011-03-11T15:29:26  <jmcarthur> it's code, so should be included with the rest of the code

2011-03-11T18:21:49  <janzert> basically I mean figure an X amount of ram per user and don't allow more users than ram is available at a time
2011-03-11T18:23:33  <McLeopold> so we just have a server wide max active users
2011-03-11T18:23:48  <janzert> yes, but no easy way to check that
2011-03-11T18:24:16  <McLeopold> we could try and keep memory full?

2011-03-11T19:58:29  <antimatroid> i worked out a semi easy way to handle colliding ants

2011-03-11T19:59:24  <sigh> the rules for collisions are pretty simple already, no?
2011-03-11T20:00:06  <antimatroid> the rules are simple, i was looking for a simple way to pick up that information was for ants that died from collision rather than battle
2011-03-11T20:00:15  <antimatroid> it's only really told implicitly, so one has to work it out
2011-03-11T20:01:11  <sigh> just have a map (squares => #dead ants)
2011-03-11T20:01:18  <sigh> it's very simple?
2011-03-11T20:02:04  <antimatroid> nah, i'm now storing a vector of chars for new values when i move ants/read input
2011-03-11T20:02:15  <antimatroid> then i can process all collisions while updating the normal value in each square
2011-03-11T20:02:59  <sigh> ok
2011-03-11T20:03:20  <antimatroid> that might sound a bit messy, but it lets me do everything needed, move ants into a square before another moves out in a game tree, to check for collisions later, and handle collisions bot in the game tree and after reading input

2011-03-11T20:21:16  <antimatroid> is it safe to assume a food square wont spawn on a square ants just collided on?
2011-03-11T20:21:26  <antimatroid> sigh: ^?
2011-03-11T20:22:37  <sigh> hmm... I don't think it does that right now... what should be the case?
2011-03-11T20:23:46  <antimatroid> well presumably one could do it
2011-03-11T20:23:53  <antimatroid> it makes input even messier though
2011-03-11T20:24:22  <antimatroid> same goes for spawning food on a square that an ant just died in from battle
2011-03-11T20:24:31  <sigh> I think it used to prevent food from spawning on squares where ant ant just died, but my refactoring removed that
2011-03-11T20:24:55  <sigh> If someone tells me what it should do, I can fix it either way, it's not too hard
2011-03-11T20:25:03  <antimatroid> i might just assume it may happen
2011-03-11T20:25:19  <sigh> from a bot's point of view that's probably best

2011-03-11T20:25:37  <antimatroid> my starter bot is ignoring all dead ant info
2011-03-11T20:25:43  <antimatroid> so that's no problems
2011-03-11T20:25:53  <antimatroid> i'm trying to work out how to process all the information for myself
2011-03-11T20:25:58  <sigh> it really only matters for the visualiser, I think
2011-03-11T20:26:17  <antimatroid> you can bet that people are going to at least try and make use of any information they receive
2011-03-11T20:26:28  <antimatroid> i plan to make use of dead ant information for evaluating states in my tree
2011-03-11T20:26:50  <antimatroid> i will probably throw out collided ant info, although i may count deaths as well as partial scores
2011-03-11T20:26:56  <sigh> sure, but I can't see how they would use it in a manner which cares about whether food appeared there or not
2011-03-11T20:27:10  <antimatroid> it's a matter of making sure you got all the information
2011-03-11T20:27:30  <antimatroid> if you just read information straight into the square, you're only going to get the last piece of information sent and throw the rest out
2011-03-11T20:28:11  <sigh> who's the best person to ask about whether food should grown on ant corpses?
2011-03-11T20:28:17  <antimatroid> mcleopold
2011-03-11T20:28:36  <antimatroid> it should be alright
2011-03-11T20:28:40  <antimatroid> it's feasible anyway
2011-03-11T20:29:42  <sigh> it's an easy change in the code either way, and bots should be able to handle either case... but it does make the visualiser easier if food doesn't spawn immediatly

2011-03-11T20:45:42  <antimatroid> sigh: i do think food shouldn't spawn next to a player
2011-03-11T20:46:24  <antimatroid> actually, i think the engine blocks walking onto a food square like water
2011-03-11T20:46:31  <antimatroid> so probably doesn't matter so much
2011-03-11T20:48:57  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold should food be able to spawn on squares where an ant just died? I think my refactoring changed it a bit there because squares are no longer marked as CONFLICT. Easy enough change if required, but I'm not sure what the desired outcome is
2011-03-11T20:48:57  <contestbot> sigh: Yes master!
2011-03-11T20:57:00  <antimatroid> hmmmm here's a situation for you, two ants walk onto a food square that spawned next to them, but another ant walks in range of the food square?
2011-03-11T20:57:15  <antimatroid> oh wait, nevermind
2011-03-11T20:57:22  <antimatroid> slow day :P
2011-03-11T20:58:30  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold This might also interfere with the attack methods, but there are some other issues with them where I can't see how they map to the specifications exactly... but I think I'll have to wait until you are here to discuss them properly
2011-03-11T20:58:30  <contestbot> sigh: As you wish.
2011-03-11T21:00:42  <sigh> antimatroid: the spec for battle resolution lists two options, do you know what is the deal with that?
2011-03-11T21:01:19  <sigh> (or anyone else)
2011-03-11T21:02:16  <antimatroid> sigh: we are very much undecided on which one to use
2011-03-11T21:02:27  <sigh> ok
2011-03-11T21:02:28  <antimatroid> pretty much everyone favours option 1 except jeff
2011-03-11T21:02:35  <antimatroid> so we're currently using option 2
2011-03-11T21:02:35  <sigh> :)
2011-03-11T21:03:33  <antimatroid> battle option 1 is mega
2011-03-11T21:03:37  <antimatroid> battle option 2 is meh
2011-03-11T21:03:48  <sigh> mega?
2011-03-11T21:03:59  <antimatroid> it makes the game play much more interesting
2011-03-11T21:04:07  <antimatroid> for so many reasons
2011-03-11T21:06:31  <antimatroid> option 2: don't get two of your ants at an equal distance to an enemy, so always send a single ant for fights and spread everyone out, which you already want to do for vision and getting food
2011-03-11T21:06:32  <antimatroid> option 1: get as many ants as possible close to an enemy, so roam around in packs, providing balance to spreading out for visibility and getting food, and it'll make heaps cooler fights

2011-03-11T22:00:03  <_flag> I've been playing around with bots and I'd like to say that the unsymmetrical maps and unsymmetrical food spawns we've been trying out are ridiculously unfair. Since each new ant has the ability to look for more food, even having just one or two more ants in the early stages of the game can make a big difference because the effect is exponential.
2011-03-11T22:00:45  <_flag> So... hopefully someone who's working on the engine reads that.
2011-03-11T22:02:16  <amstan> _flag: they're unsymmetrical?
2011-03-11T22:02:29  <amstan> antimatroid: didn't you make the maps to be tiled?
2011-03-11T22:03:14  <_flag> amstan: well he tried some unsymmetrical maps like a week ago, I think he's reverted since, but the food spawns have the same effect
2011-03-11T22:04:56  <_flag> I haven't really stayed up to date on what's going on
2011-03-11T22:05:08  <_flag> But I assume the food spawns are still random
2011-03-11T23:26:34  <janzert> I think the food spawns just got changed yesterday to be symmetric
2011-03-11T23:43:59  <_flag> janzert: okay, I'll download the most recent engine and check it out
2011-03-11T23:45:50  <janzert> I'm not completely positive about it, I just know sigh has been working on it the last few days

2011-03-11T23:56:34  <_flag> janzert: still seems to spawn randomly for me, but there are some new functions which would appear to be for spawning food symmetrically, so maybe I have to edit something
