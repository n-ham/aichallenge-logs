2011-10-12T08:36:14  <aarossig> I feel that the proportions are off a little, the header is a little too short

2011-10-12T08:37:00  <amstan> aarossig: they wanted to change the header height, and they had to rename it
2011-10-12T08:37:04  <amstan> aarossig: offer a new design
2011-10-12T08:37:07  <aarossig> name change is fine

2011-10-12T08:37:38  <aarossig> header should be left alone, it was similar proportions to the navbar and created a bit of unity in the design
2011-10-12T08:38:01  <amstan> mcstar: what's with the blue?
2011-10-12T08:38:15  <aarossig> mcstar: lol

2011-10-12T08:38:27  <mcstar> you dont have to agree :)
2011-10-12T08:38:48  <mcstar> pay attention to the grey background
2011-10-12T08:38:50  <aarossig> I don't agree
2011-10-12T08:39:03  <aarossig> blue+green just induces headaches :P
2011-10-12T08:39:10  <mcstar> and colors aside)

2011-10-12T08:40:14  <aarossig> anyway -- I suggest we revert to the old header with the new name

2011-10-12T08:53:40  <mcstar> not that anyone should care, but the shorter header is much better

2011-10-12T08:55:17  <amstan> it's too extreme
2011-10-12T08:57:01  <mcstar> aarossig: do you see those horizontal separators on the sidebar?
2011-10-12T08:57:29  <amstan> they're ok colour wise, but they should be full width
2011-10-12T08:57:43  <mcstar> i think they depend on the browser and its theme
2011-10-12T08:57:52  <mcstar> for example its very ugly for me
2011-10-12T08:58:10  <mcstar> i using a redmond95 theme, and it shouldnt interfere with those separators
2011-10-12T08:58:16  <mcstar> m*
2011-10-12T08:58:31  <amstan> mcstar: screenshot?
2011-10-12T08:58:56  <mcstar> just look at the one i linked in
2011-10-12T08:59:08  <mcstar> and be sure its 100%
2011-10-12T08:59:17  <mcstar> i mean the zoom-level
2011-10-12T08:59:36  <amstan> mcstar: i don't know what's going on there though
2011-10-12T08:59:41  <amstan> it's all gray and stuff
2011-10-12T08:59:48  <amstan> can you just give me the original?

2011-10-12T09:03:07  <mcstar> this was in ff

2011-10-12T09:03:50  <amstan> ok
2011-10-12T09:04:08  <mcstar> ok, i thought its the theme, then its simply ugly
2011-10-12T09:04:30  <mcstar> of course it doesnt have a big impact or anything

2011-10-12T09:35:32  <mcstar> this works for me
2011-10-12T09:35:39  <mcstar> but i dont know anything about java
2011-10-12T09:37:39  <mcstar> yeah, confirmed, works when i run play_one_game.sh
2011-10-12T09:38:40  <mcstar> one thing you could try is using double backslashes instead of single ones
2011-10-12T09:39:05  <mcstar> i guess its windows or os/2 that youre using, so you basically escape with \ (maybe i dont know)
2011-10-12T09:42:12  <Abrackadabra> so
2011-10-12T09:42:32  <Abrackadabra> should i use java MyBot"

2011-10-12T09:45:26  <Abrackadabra> doesnt work
2011-10-12T09:45:46  <Abrackadabra> the problem is
2011-10-12T09:46:02  <Abrackadabra> when i run "java MyBot" from console - it's ok
2011-10-12T09:46:42  <mleise> Abrackadabra: you start java MyBot from the bot directory, right?
2011-10-12T09:46:50  <Abrackadabra> but when i give "java MyBot" to playgame.py it says "Error: Could not find or load main class ..MyBot"
2011-10-12T09:47:04  <Abrackadabra> yes
2011-10-12T09:47:16  <mcstar> i told you what to do, it works from anywhere
2011-10-12T09:47:17  <mleise> "java -cp <path to class file(s)> MyBot" <- !!!
2011-10-12T09:47:29  <mcstar> exactly
2011-10-12T09:47:47  <mcstar> one thing though, maybe you should use relative filenames, maybe it does matter
2011-10-12T09:48:13  <g0llum> playgame.py does some magic to the  so maybe it works with the same dp~ syntax applied to the greedy.py bot there
2011-10-12T09:48:31  <mcstar> to the?
2011-10-12T09:49:14  <Abrackadabra> mleise: java -cp c:\temp\ants\tools\mybot MyBot doesnt work too
2011-10-12T09:50:27  <mleise> Abrackadabra: and the .class files are in that directory, not in a subfolder 'bin' or something?
2011-10-12T09:50:33  <mleise> that is strange
2011-10-12T09:50:37  <Abrackadabra> exactly
2011-10-12T09:51:03  <mleise> Abrackadabra: can you run "java -cp c:\temp\ants\tools\mybot MyBot" from any other directory?
2011-10-12T09:51:16  <mleise> Just to check if the syntax is ok
2011-10-12T09:51:32  <Abrackadabra> when i run it from anywhere else from console it's ok
2011-10-12T09:53:48  <Abrackadabra> look
2011-10-12T09:53:49  <mleise> then I'm confused and have no idea.
2011-10-12T09:53:58  <Abrackadabra> just like me
2011-10-12T09:55:02  <mleise> g0llum: there is a big gap in your last sentence. do you mind to fill it?
2011-10-12T09:55:17  <mcstar> step outside from the class's directory
2011-10-12T09:55:19  <mcstar> Abrackadabra:
2011-10-12T09:55:30  <mcstar> then use pls relative path to it
2011-10-12T09:55:39  <mcstar> that is mybot
2011-10-12T09:55:45  <mcstar> and try that way
2011-10-12T09:55:53  <g0llum> the path to greedy.bot in his cmdline had some dp~ in it
2011-10-12T09:55:57  <Abrackadabra> you mean java -cp mybot MyBot?
2011-10-12T09:56:01  <mcstar> if you are in the same directory where your classes are, the -cp option doesnt matter
2011-10-12T09:56:05  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-12T09:56:18  <Abrackadabra> it doesnt work too
2011-10-12T09:56:32  <Abrackadabra> i tried both relative and absolute paths
2011-10-12T09:56:51  <Abrackadabra> look, i found something strange
2011-10-12T09:57:01  <mcstar> so it only works when you launch from the same directory as where the class files asre
2011-10-12T09:57:11  <mcstar> arse
2011-10-12T09:57:13  <mcstar> are
2011-10-12T09:57:28  <Abrackadabra> and i tried it too
2011-10-12T09:58:17  <mcstar> what?
2011-10-12T09:58:23  <mcstar> tried what? found what?
2011-10-12T09:58:30  <Abrackadabra> when i try to use java -cp c:\temp\ants\tools\mybot somethingMeaningLess
2011-10-12T09:59:01  <Abrackadabra> it says Error: Could not find or load main class somethingMeaningLess
2011-10-12T09:59:06  <Abrackadabra> that makes sense

2011-10-12T10:12:40  <delt0r> I am a java person ...
2011-10-12T10:12:47  * delt0r reads up the logs
2011-10-12T10:12:53  <mcstar> yes, for testbot you give a map as a parameter
2011-10-12T10:13:00  <mcstar> so cmd uses % for parameters
2011-10-12T10:13:05  <mcstar> basically you can cut it out
2011-10-12T10:13:25  <mcstar> now make the necessary modification
2011-10-12T10:13:37  <mcstar> change one of the python thing to java MyBot

2011-10-12T10:16:22  <mcstar> argh, with space in the name?
2011-10-12T10:16:28  <delt0r> you need to ensure class path and cd are correct
2011-10-12T10:16:49  <delt0r> this is what the python seems to have different between versions and oses
2011-10-12T10:17:17  <delt0r> java -cp /home/awesomebot/ MyBot
2011-10-12T10:18:01  <delt0r> I put the script with my classes (I use eclipse) and have java -cp . MyBot
2011-10-12T10:18:25  <delt0r> and then use "/home/bob/workspace/awesomebot/RunMyBot.sh
2011-10-12T10:18:26  <Abrackadabra> well
2011-10-12T10:18:29  <delt0r> for example
2011-10-12T10:18:46  <Abrackadabra> by bat is "java -cp mybot MyBot"
2011-10-12T10:18:46  <delt0r> its the most reliable way...
2011-10-12T10:18:52  <delt0r> but not the only way
2011-10-12T10:19:29  <delt0r> Unfortunatly i have not used windows in soo long... i don't even know how bats behave with respect to pwd and stuff like that
2011-10-12T10:19:48  <delt0r> so a full path for -cp is the first thing to try
2011-10-12T10:20:04  <Abrackadabra> so
2011-10-12T10:20:06  <delt0r> then if that works you now know that its a classpath issue
2011-10-12T10:20:18  <Abrackadabra> i created 1.bat "java -cp c:\temp\ants\tools\mybot MyBot"

2011-10-12T10:40:53  <mcstar> and for gawd's sake answer Abrackadabra if you use double slashes aka \\ does it work?
2011-10-12T10:41:42  <Abrackadabra> wait a second please
2011-10-12T10:42:44  <delt0r> oh yea... \ is a special character...
2011-10-12T10:46:16  <mcstar> and probably the solution is: you shouldnt quote that pat in the first place
2011-10-12T10:46:24  <mcstar> quote only if t has spaces
2011-10-12T10:46:34  <mcstar> path*
2011-10-12T10:46:36  <mcstar> it*
2011-10-12T10:46:58  <sir_macelon> you could use slashes ("/") instead of backslashes in the path ("\"), that's how I do it

2011-10-12T10:55:58  <sir_macelon> are you sure you are pointing your classpath to the MyBot.class file?
2011-10-12T10:56:27  <delt0r> you would get a class path error then

2011-10-12T10:57:38  <mcstar> Abrackadabra: so?

2011-10-12T10:57:51  <mcstar> unquoting or doulbe backslashing?

2011-10-12T11:59:55  <mcstar> delt0r: this should work doesnt it? "java -cp ./ MyBot"
2011-10-12T12:00:00  <mcstar> he tried this
2011-10-12T12:00:14  <Abrackadabra> this is not a java thing
2011-10-12T12:00:21  <delt0r> only if the current directory is the correct class path
2011-10-12T12:00:30  <mcstar> yes, the MyBot.class is in there
2011-10-12T12:00:38  <delt0r> again i would try with absolute path names
2011-10-12T12:00:39  <mcstar> as far as im told
2011-10-12T12:00:40  <Abrackadabra> playgame.py executes "java MyBot" in a very wrong way
2011-10-12T12:01:13  <delt0r> since you may not be getting the proper pwd within the python enjoyment
2011-10-12T12:01:17  <mcstar> the 2 .'s cannot appear there because of playgame.py
2011-10-12T12:01:30  <mcstar> and anyway, youre the first one who complains about this
2011-10-12T12:01:43  <mcstar> there are many people who use java on windows already
2011-10-12T12:01:43  <delt0r> "java MyBot" is always wrong
2011-10-12T12:02:16  <mcstar> why?
2011-10-12T12:02:19  <mcstar> it is working for me
2011-10-12T12:02:35  <Abrackadabra> well it gets the same result as "java -cp ./ MyBot"
2011-10-12T12:02:38  <delt0r> because you should always state the class path
2011-10-12T12:02:49  <delt0r> even if ./ is implied
2011-10-12T12:03:16  <delt0r> remeber this is not the command line --some other program is launching the program
2011-10-12T12:03:52  <delt0r> also there is almost never a time with a bunch of other jars are needed so you always have one anyway

2011-10-12T12:05:01  <mcstar> delt0r: i think too that its better to use full path, cause you dont know what is $PWD when the .subprocess calls the bot
2011-10-12T12:05:18  <delt0r> java -cp splat MyBot worked from the command line but never from playgame
2011-10-12T12:05:29  <delt0r> indeed
2011-10-12T12:05:35  <Abrackadabra> same
2011-10-12T12:06:00  <Abrackadabra> with absolute path
2011-10-12T12:06:29  <delt0r> that is why i use a script to run it.

2011-10-12T12:20:39  <mleise> uh, the router should give me a nameserver, no?#

2011-10-12T12:21:23  <mcstar> and basically i dont know how, pppoe sets your resolve.conf
2011-10-12T12:21:29  <Abrackadabra> i downloaded tools
2011-10-12T12:21:45  <mcstar> without having the nameserver(s) there you can only use ip's
2011-10-12T12:21:57  <mcstar> try this: nameserver 213.46.246.54
2011-10-12T12:22:05  <mcstar> put this into /etc/resolv.conf

2011-10-12T12:22:26  <mcstar> really?
2011-10-12T12:22:28  <Abrackadabra> and try to run it with playgame.py
2011-10-12T12:22:36  <mcstar> does it dial by itself?

2011-10-12T12:25:55  <Abrackadabra> it means?..
2011-10-12T12:26:19  <mcstar> McLeopold: ..Mybot but why?
2011-10-12T12:26:26  <McLeopold> we may not have the same setup.  So, you have all of your java files in the same directory as playgame.py?
2011-10-12T12:26:39  <Abrackadabra> yes
2011-10-12T12:28:28  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: did you compile with "javac MyBot.java" and have a MyBot.class?
2011-10-12T12:29:36  <Abrackadabra> i compiled with javac *.java and have a .class

2011-10-12T12:35:35  <mcstar> btw if anyone is wondering since when i care about java, well, since i care about clojure
2011-10-12T12:36:25  <mcstar> and i would like to be able to compile clojure programs, but it seems it must follow some java convention of using namespaces and directories
2011-10-12T12:37:20  <mleise> restarting the router helped
2011-10-12T12:38:22  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: looks like you are running "javac *.java" in the mybot dir and copying the files down?
2011-10-12T12:39:24  <Abrackadabra> hm... yes
2011-10-12T12:41:31  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: you should be able to test by just running "java MyBot.class", then you can type "ready" and look for a "go"
2011-10-12T12:42:05  <Abrackadabra> it workd
2011-10-12T12:42:08  <Abrackadabra> works
2011-10-12T12:42:23  <Abrackadabra> but not java MyBot.class, java MyBot
2011-10-12T12:42:24  <McLeopold> un, I meant "java MyBot"
2011-10-12T12:42:26  <McLeopold> yeah, ok
2011-10-12T12:43:22  <mcstar> lol
2011-10-12T12:43:38  <mcstar> McLeopold: when i copied over the compiled .class file, it stopped working
2011-10-12T12:44:29  <mcstar> Error: Could not find or load main class HunterBot
2011-10-12T12:45:18  <mcstar> i see
2011-10-12T12:45:35  <mcstar> for thehunterbot to work properly, there are other files that must be copied over
2011-10-12T12:46:11  <mcstar> no not working still, when everything is copied
2011-10-12T12:46:29  <mcstar> now java seems more and more esoteric to me
2011-10-12T12:47:09  <McLeopold> Abrackadabra: try the make.cmd to make a jar file
2011-10-12T12:47:27  <McLeopold> then use "java -jar mybot/MyBot.jar" for your playgame command
2011-10-12T12:48:53  <mcstar> McLeopold: the .class files have absolute path information in them?
2011-10-12T12:49:00  <Abrackadabra> it works!!!
2011-10-12T12:49:03  <McLeopold> sweet
2011-10-12T12:49:31  <McLeopold> jars are nice, because you don't have to be an expert in classpaths, the downside is you never learn what is really happening

2011-10-12T12:49:59  <Abrackadabra> thank you guys
2011-10-12T12:50:23  <mcstar> yes, it was a lesson
2011-10-12T12:52:22  <mcstar> Abrackadabra: the upside is that now you have cygwin
2011-10-12T12:52:45  <McLeopold> playgame modifies "java MyBot" to "java .\MyBot" which is causing the issues
2011-10-12T12:53:32  <mcstar> what does it do when the first argument is -cp?
2011-10-12T12:54:01  <McLeopold> java -cp .\MyBot
2011-10-12T12:54:10  <McLeopold> or did you want more after the -cp?
2011-10-12T12:54:25  <janzert> McLeopold: My ping earlier is I am thinking about moving the ants graphic to the left side of the header, wondering what you think of the look
2011-10-12T12:54:33  <mcstar> yes, like java -cp rel/path/to/class MyClass
2011-10-12T12:54:46  <janzert> Do you have firebug or something similiar that will let you dynamically alter CSS?
2011-10-12T12:54:56  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, I use crome
2011-10-12T12:55:14  <McLeopold> mcstar "java -cp . .\MyBot"
2011-10-12T12:55:54  <mcstar> McLeopold: excuse my nubness, but isnt that wrong? MyBot is the class name, not a path to something
2011-10-12T12:56:04  <McLeopold> janzert: I don't know, I like the ants crawling over the word ants, but the highlight still looks a bit amature.  Maybe let aarossig fix it up?
2011-10-12T12:56:21  <janzert> ok, just disable the rules "background-image" in "#header .right" and "background" in "#header .left, #footer" section to take a look at it
2011-10-12T12:56:51  <janzert> yeah, I do kind of like it under the word. at the same time moving it seems more balanced
2011-10-12T12:57:23  <mcstar> McLeopold: take a look at this: http://i.imgur.com/QHzZ5.png
2011-10-12T12:57:33  <mcstar> i cant take the critique
2011-10-12T12:57:38  <mcstar> can*
2011-10-12T12:59:20  <delt0r> McLeopold: That is why i need to use a launch script, because MyBot is getting mangled to ./MyBot ?
2011-10-12T12:59:25  <delt0r> not that it matters.
2011-10-12T12:59:37  <delt0r> I prefer to use a launch script anyways
2011-10-12T12:59:39  <McLeopold> delt0r: it does, and I do want to fix it
2011-10-12T13:00:42  <McLeopold> janzert: can't get it to show, just change the site
2011-10-12T13:00:57  <janzert> mcstar: The colored Google pulls the eye too much, but other than that I don't mind it
2011-10-12T13:01:01  <janzert> McLeopold: ok
2011-10-12T13:01:50  <mcstar> maybe wo the red O
2011-10-12T13:02:01  <mcstar> its just a mockup, if you liek something take it
2011-10-12T13:02:36  <mcstar> i learned today that significant members of your group consider the choosing of the colors ugly, which i can accept
2011-10-12T13:03:13  <janzert> McLeopold: take a look now
2011-10-12T13:03:35  <janzert> if we went this way the ants color should probably be dialed back down too
2011-10-12T13:04:36  <McLeopold> janzert: not a fan
2011-10-12T13:05:03  <janzert> ok
2011-10-12T13:05:13  <janzert> I wasn't sure one way or the other

2011-10-12T13:13:10  <McLeopold> mcstar: another part of the confusion was that Abrackadabra had a mybot dir, which playgame was finding, in addition to MyBot.class
2011-10-12T13:13:53  <janzert> McLeopold: how about something like that?
2011-10-12T13:14:14  <janzert> basically 20px and aligning both lines
2011-10-12T13:14:40  <janzert> the part I don't like is how the g and G are getting squished together with that alignment :(
2011-10-12T13:15:35  <janzert> the other alignment the tail of the g fit nicely between the G and l
2011-10-12T13:15:42  <mcstar> but now half the header is empty :(
2011-10-12T13:15:59  <janzert> mcstar: it has been
2011-10-12T13:16:06  <mcstar> talk to aarossig about this, he has some input, regarding the height of the header
2011-10-12T13:16:08  <McLeopold> mcstar: we can fill that up with useful info, if we need
2011-10-12T13:16:12  <janzert> that was my motivation for moving the ant graphic
2011-10-12T13:16:24  <mcstar> he opened an issue about it in the morning
2011-10-12T13:16:29  <mcstar> ok
2011-10-12T13:16:29  <McLeopold> janzert: we could extend the header to maybe 125 or 130, to give room for "Google"
2011-10-12T13:20:00  <McLeopold> janzert: also, the spacing that you are doing really ought to be done with em
2011-10-12T13:20:03  <McLeopold> not px
2011-10-12T13:20:41  <janzert> except we're already doing px defined layout for sizing anyway
2011-10-12T13:21:03  <janzert> i.e. font size, header height, column widths
2011-10-12T13:21:15  <janzert> otherwise I'd agree
2011-10-12T13:21:18  <amstan> problem is that images don't go well with em sizes
2011-10-12T13:21:23  <amstan> but.. hmm
2011-10-12T13:21:27  <amstan> we don't really have many images
2011-10-12T13:21:39  <amstan> we could do everything em then
2011-10-12T13:22:00  <McLeopold> whoa, github site redesign...
2011-10-12T13:22:27  <amstan> McLeopold: happened a while ago
2011-10-12T13:22:29  <amstan> like 2 weeks
2011-10-12T13:22:47  <McLeopold> no, I just got a different menu look from this morning
2011-10-12T13:22:55  <amstan> hmm
2011-10-12T13:22:59  <amstan> that is new, nvm
2011-10-12T13:23:01  <McLeopold> the issues number is smaller and in serif font, with a brown bar
2011-10-12T13:23:11  <amstan> yeah, kinda hard to read
2011-10-12T13:24:51  <janzert> header is expanded to 110 or 50% of the right column width

2011-10-12T13:26:33  <janzert> or rather the rule was too specific
2011-10-12T13:26:56  <McLeopold> okay, now "Google" is squished again :)

2011-10-12T13:29:56  <McLeopold> or center right
2011-10-12T13:29:58  <mleise> I wonder how it will look like in IE8 when it's done
2011-10-12T13:30:17  <amstan> i just waited until someone with ie8 fixed it
2011-10-12T13:30:27  <amstan> it's nice when you have teams in webdev
2011-10-12T13:30:30  <McLeopold> eewww
2011-10-12T13:30:39  <janzert> left and right is the first parameter
2011-10-12T13:30:39  <McLeopold> it looks *really* bad
2011-10-12T13:30:51  <janzert> vertical the second
2011-10-12T13:31:23  <janzert> but I don't like right center much either

2011-10-12T13:32:45  <janzert> hehe
2011-10-12T13:33:07  <amstan> seems like the css is not loading or something
2011-10-12T13:33:11  <janzert> I assume that's after you fiddled with the css?
2011-10-12T13:33:19  <amstan> not even the content a are styled
2011-10-12T13:33:28  <janzert> looks like some broken rules
2011-10-12T13:33:49  <McLeopold> that was IE9 in compatibility mode
2011-10-12T13:34:23  <amstan> yeah, it shouldn't be in compatibility mode
2011-10-12T13:34:47  <amstan> maybe get a css/html standards test
2011-10-12T13:35:37  <McLeopold> amstan: get aarossig in here, we need someone to make the word "Ants" and the ants look awesome

2011-10-12T13:37:13  <amstan> if the height is bigger, the logo won't overlap, so you can remove the white shadow

2011-10-12T14:20:14  <janzert> I was thinking that but I'm not sure either way, since the five minute quickstart is probably a better place for them to go and links to the starter packages
2011-10-12T14:20:19  <McLeopold> amstan: partially observable, deterministic, discrete, adversarial
2011-10-12T14:20:45  <amstan> McLeopold: you taking that too?
2011-10-12T14:20:46  <McLeopold> the link should be in both
2011-10-12T14:21:07  <McLeopold> amstan: yes, just so I can hang Peters signature on my wall :)
2011-10-12T14:21:22  <McLeopold> but it feels really low level
2011-10-12T14:21:23  <janzert> yes, it should be in both the menu and the guide but I'm not sure it should come before the guide in the menu ;)
2011-10-12T14:22:20  <McLeopold> janzert: http://ietherpad.com/yXdEgg5Lko
2011-10-12T14:23:46  <janzert> hmm, the horizontal rules are just placeholders marking updated content right?
2011-10-12T14:24:16  <McLeopold> it was more to highlight the starterpacks and the quickstart guide
2011-10-12T14:24:33  <McLeopold> just a little visual separation to pull them out
2011-10-12T14:24:39  <janzert> hmm, I really don't like the look of them
2011-10-12T14:24:51  <McLeopold> I tried to mute them as much as possible
2011-10-12T14:25:00  <McLeopold> I'm really just interested in the extra space
2011-10-12T14:25:15  <janzert> maybe just emphasize the text a bit?
2011-10-12T14:25:23  <McLeopold> sure, let's try that
2011-10-12T14:25:27  <janzert> slightly different color or weight, etc.
2011-10-12T14:25:47  <McLeopold> make the other text #ddd or something, then white will stand out
2011-10-12T14:27:07  <janzert> although at the same time, maybe they shouldn't be emphasized in the menu at all but made prominent in the front page content?
2011-10-12T14:27:18  <amstan> it's hilarious hearing the prof try to pronounce the romanian city names
2011-10-12T14:27:34  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-10-12T14:27:47  <amstan> McLeopold: where are you at?
2011-10-12T14:27:59  <janzert> should "Create Your Account" be there since Sign Up is?
2011-10-12T14:28:02  <McLeopold> will all this knowledge about ai, I'm surprised they write with pens and then overlay checkboxes and stuff on it
2011-10-12T14:28:18  <McLeopold> amstan: as far as I can get
2011-10-12T14:28:40  <janzert> also Sign Out, My Profile and Upload Code are what should be there when logged in, Sign Up and Sign In when not
2011-10-12T14:28:49  <mleise> is that emboss effect css3?
2011-10-12T14:28:54  <McLeopold> right, but ietherpad isn't dynamic :)
2011-10-12T14:29:03  <janzert> but otherwise I think that order looks good
2011-10-12T14:29:16  <janzert> :)
2011-10-12T14:29:27  <janzert> mleise: which effect?
2011-10-12T14:29:38  <mleise> may I add that I find the horizontal bars in the navigation bar confusing?
2011-10-12T14:29:39  <janzert> the one that used to be around "Ants"?
2011-10-12T14:29:43  <mleise> janzert: the effect on Ants
2011-10-12T14:29:54  <McLeopold> mleise: yes, and they are going away
2011-10-12T14:30:23  <janzert> the one that was there this morning was created by using two css3 drop shadows, yes
2011-10-12T14:30:36  <janzert> the one that is there now is using a single drop shadow
2011-10-12T14:30:47  <janzert> but I guess I wouldn't call it an emboss effect
2011-10-12T14:31:12  <mleise> oh, i had the old version on my screen - which looked cool
2011-10-12T14:31:13  <janzert> possibly your css hasn't refreshed since the change
2011-10-12T14:31:38  <janzert> apparently no one but you and me liked it though ;)
2011-10-12T14:33:19  <janzert> McLeopold: do you agree with Create Your Account going away?
2011-10-12T14:33:46  <McLeopold> hmm, yeah
2011-10-12T14:33:51  <McLeopold> it's the same as sign up
2011-10-12T14:33:57  * janzert nods
2011-10-12T14:34:34  <janzert> want me to work on the rearranging or were you?
2011-10-12T14:34:44  <McLeopold> updated my winxp and java, and I don't get the DEP anymore
2011-10-12T14:34:51  <McLeopold> janzert: you
2011-10-12T14:34:53  <janzert> yay :)
2011-10-12T14:34:56  <janzert> ok
2011-10-12T14:36:44  <mleise> I think Sign In / Sign Up is not intuitive especially for non-native speakers. It is short and neat though :-)
2011-10-12T14:37:01  <mleise> Login / Register anyone?
2011-10-12T14:37:16  <mleise> Login / Create Your Account?
2011-10-12T14:37:17  <janzert> also the good thing is that it is made more explicit in the starter guide
2011-10-12T14:37:45  <janzert> five minute quickstart guide that is
2011-10-12T14:38:05  <mleise> that is an *absolute* link?
2011-10-12T14:38:17  <mleise> aren't these evil?
2011-10-12T14:38:27  <janzert> where?
2011-10-12T14:38:35  <mleise> ok, i shut up already. in the starter guide
2011-10-12T14:39:04  <janzert> ahh, we do try to avoid them yes
2011-10-12T14:40:03  <janzert> the trouble is that for content getting pulled from the wiki it relative links will be broken there
2011-10-12T14:40:35  <janzert> so I think authors tend to use absolute links when writing the page
2011-10-12T14:40:36  <mleise> oh now that you mention it! how is the wiki content converted?
2011-10-12T14:40:46  <mleise> I found that some of my text was massacrated
2011-10-12T14:41:08  <janzert> McLeopold just changed how it is handled this morning
2011-10-12T14:41:15  <janzert> I haven't really looked at it
2011-10-12T14:41:34  <mleise> ok let me check if the problem is gone...

2011-10-12T15:05:19  <janzert> mleise: no
2011-10-12T15:05:33  <janzert> at least I don't believe so at all
2011-10-12T15:06:19  <McLeopold> janzert: sure, I'm starting to not care... :)
2011-10-12T15:06:25  <janzert> I'm just not finding a color combination between the normal menu links and the highlighted ones that I'm really liking :}
2011-10-12T15:07:27  <janzert> I'll just go with the marker color for now then

2011-10-12T16:06:18  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: ping
2011-10-12T16:12:12  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: what's up?
2011-10-12T16:13:16  <ChrisH_> I was just reading the McLeopold Focus Battle spec page, which is very useful BTW, and had a comment or two
2011-10-12T16:13:30  <McLeopold> for improvements?
2011-10-12T16:14:13  <ChrisH_> The main thing being that not all of the examples could occur in a real game. That may be on purpose, if so, never mind, but it if not on purpose...
2011-10-12T16:14:31  <ChrisH_> ...maybe a revision is warranted.
2011-10-12T16:15:12  <ChrisH_> The one that jumps out at me is the Wall Punch section.
2011-10-12T16:15:12  <janzert> is the McLeopold Focus Battle spec page different than the Ants Focus Battle Resolution page?
2011-10-12T16:15:35  <ChrisH_> janzert: no, sorry, not sure how I typed that.
2011-10-12T16:15:56  <janzert> heh, ok. just thought I might be missing new interesting content
2011-10-12T16:16:10  <ChrisH_> LOL, sorry for the confusion.
2011-10-12T16:16:16  <McLeopold> the wall punch is the most unlikely, but they could all occur
2011-10-12T16:17:10  <ChrisH_> Anyway, in an actual dynamic game it isn't possible for a bunch of enemy ants to get into the Wall Punch configuration because some of them would have to die before the two groups could get that close.
2011-10-12T16:17:39  <ChrisH_> Unless there were some hills spawning ants into that configuation of course.
2011-10-12T16:17:52  <ChrisH_> ;)
2011-10-12T16:18:15  <ChrisH_> So, I don't know if you care, but I thought I would mention it in case you did.

2011-10-12T22:12:22  <McLeopold> aarossig: you around?
2011-10-12T22:21:52  <McLeopold> anybody use password software?
2011-10-12T22:27:56  <janzert> what sort of password software? I use Password Maker in my browser for general passwords and Password Safe separately for secure passwords
2011-10-12T22:32:15  <McLeopold> I think I'm going with bruce's stuff, passwordsafe.sourceforge.net
2011-10-12T22:32:33  <McLeopold> I use pwgen for making em
2011-10-12T22:32:36  <janzert> yep, that's password safe
2011-10-12T22:43:28  <aarossig> McLeopold: you rang?
2011-10-12T22:47:24  <aarossig> McLeopold: okay, I did some log reading -- just clear up what you want me to do. This IRC runs in a screen session so I'll read your reply sooner or later
2011-10-12T23:05:36  <amstan> McLeopold: what's this ai-contest.css?
2011-10-12T23:05:57  <amstan> McLeopold: it doesn't seem to work on my server when i have it in a folder
2011-10-12T23:06:05  <amstan> do i have to exec anything?
2011-10-12T23:06:18  <janzert> website/setup.py will generate it
2011-10-12T23:06:43  <janzert> basically it's just a concatenation of all the css files under website/css
2011-10-12T23:06:51  <aarossig> amstan: what do you think of my suggestions to solve this landing page/header issue?
2011-10-12T23:06:56  <amstan> oh, it does, ok
2011-10-12T23:07:26  <amstan> idk yet
2011-10-12T23:07:32  <amstan> ^^ aarossig
2011-10-12T23:07:41  <janzert> aarossig: I should be sleeping already, but I think the front page should be what you're referring to as a splash page
2011-10-12T23:07:49  <janzert> and it can hang around for logged in users too
2011-10-12T23:08:06  <aarossig> janzert: yes.. but I was thinking to create it like facebook has
2011-10-12T23:08:27  <aarossig> and we can have our identity clearly marked on that page as well -- giant ant logo or something like that
2011-10-12T23:08:39  <janzert> but I still don't think it should have a large header ;) since that will just push your beautiful content that will draw them in below the fold
2011-10-12T23:08:51  <McLeopold> aarossig: just looking for some front page love
2011-10-12T23:09:13  <aarossig> this splash page for non-logged in users might not even have a navbar or header...
2011-10-12T23:09:29  <janzert> remember for some largish percentage of your users below the fold content might as well not exist
2011-10-12T23:09:31  <aarossig> a barebones page to grab your attention
2011-10-12T23:09:59  <aarossig> ANTS! login here: ___ sign up here: ___
2011-10-12T23:10:03  <janzert> meh, make it an interesting, draw you in front page
2011-10-12T23:10:20  <janzert> something that tells them how exciting the contest is :)
2011-10-12T23:10:30  <aarossig> janzert: exactly - something eye catching and quick
2011-10-12T23:10:46  <aarossig> McLeopold: Your book suggestion is on my rather large pile
2011-10-12T23:10:55  <aarossig> (of books to read)
2011-10-12T23:11:05  <janzert> surely the regular home page can be made to fill the roll
2011-10-12T23:11:45  <amstan> ugh.. this doesn't work for me
2011-10-12T23:11:55  <aarossig> janzert: maybe it can. If we intend to use it as a blog, do you think it will still work?
2011-10-12T23:11:59  <amstan> concat css should be first
2011-10-12T23:12:15  <janzert> I don't think the front page should turn into a blog
2011-10-12T23:12:26  <aarossig> isn't that what we have right now?
2011-10-12T23:12:40  <aarossig> more or less...
2011-10-12T23:12:53  <janzert> right now we don't really have much of anything
2011-10-12T23:12:57  <janzert> just a short intro really
2011-10-12T23:13:06  <aarossig> okay, fair enough then
2011-10-12T23:13:19  <janzert> the frontpage will stay pretty static throughout the contest
2011-10-12T23:13:39  <aarossig> good to know, is this a change from previous contests?
2011-10-12T23:13:46  <janzert> probably a few announcements added for the finals and then the results and that is hopefully it
2011-10-12T23:13:50  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-12T23:13:50  <janzert> nope
2011-10-12T23:14:06  <aarossig> okay, that's what I remembered from tron when I first wanted to help improve your site design
2011-10-12T23:14:55  <janzert> it might have been more of a blog feel for tron, I guess I don't really remember very accurately that far back :/
2011-10-12T23:15:30  <aarossig> well, the main reason that I'm kind of put off by these sudden changes is because I feel that we shouldn't let anything hold us back for our landing page (aside from flash)
2011-10-12T23:15:49  <janzert> ?
2011-10-12T23:16:02  <aarossig> it should be visually appealing and grab the attention of as many users as possible, even if they don't know how to program
2011-10-12T23:16:45  <janzert> I agree, I just feel that should be able to fit into the framework of the header and sidebar that go with the rest of the site as well
2011-10-12T23:16:55  <amstan> i made the gradient more inthe title
2011-10-12T23:16:57  <amstan> http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/website/
2011-10-12T23:17:08  <janzert> it should be able to hold that steady as the move onto other parts of the site
2011-10-12T23:17:19  <amstan> the title looks better if there's gradient under it, by being smaller, it was getting in the solid section only
2011-10-12T23:17:46  <janzert> amstan: looks the same as what is currently live to me
2011-10-12T23:17:53  <aarossig> amstan: same
2011-10-12T23:17:59  <janzert> did you rebuild the css after changing?
2011-10-12T23:18:00  <amstan> hard refresh
2011-10-12T23:18:04  <amstan> i did, yes
2011-10-12T23:18:13  <janzert> yep, I did
2011-10-12T23:18:32  <janzert> and I don't think I've visited that page before so shouldn't have been cached anyway
2011-10-12T23:18:41  <janzert> or if I have it was months ago
2011-10-12T23:18:45  <amstan> put the main one next to it
2011-10-12T23:18:50  <amstan> and switch between them
2011-10-12T23:18:57  <janzert> I'm flipping between two tabs
2011-10-12T23:18:59  <amstan> oh
2011-10-12T23:19:06  <aarossig> what might solve this header issue... reduce the size of the AI Challenge text?
2011-10-12T23:19:10  <amstan> sorry about that, forgot to do other browsers, only changed webkit
2011-10-12T23:19:15  * amstan is an idiot
2011-10-12T23:19:16  <janzert> only thing changes is glow behind Ants disappears
2011-10-12T23:19:19  <janzert> ahh
2011-10-12T23:19:32  <amstan> try now
2011-10-12T23:19:47  <janzert> now it's there :)
2011-10-12T23:20:00  <aarossig> yeah, it's there for me too -- though the difference is rather small
2011-10-12T23:20:25  <amstan> aarossig: red ants?
2011-10-12T23:20:34  <aarossig> amstan: try making the font smaller on AI Challenge and Ants
2011-10-12T23:20:36  <amstan> aarossig: fan of that?
2011-10-12T23:20:48  <janzert> biggest thing I don't like about the header atm is the left feels too bare and right too crowded
2011-10-12T23:21:02  <amstan> janzert: yeah, it worked better with the longer name
2011-10-12T23:21:03  <aarossig> amstan: yea, that was always part of my svg file but the red got washed out from low-res
2011-10-12T23:21:09  <janzert> amstan: yes
2011-10-12T23:21:26  <amstan> there
2011-10-12T23:21:29  <aarossig> they do look good
2011-10-12T23:21:29  <amstan> fixed the title length
2011-10-12T23:21:35  <janzert> hehe
2011-10-12T23:21:46  <aarossig> lol
2011-10-12T23:21:52  <aarossig> Double Rainbow
2011-10-12T23:22:00  <janzert> ok, I'm really off for the night
2011-10-12T23:22:07  <amstan> janzert: cya
2011-10-12T23:22:08  <janzert> have fun :)

2011-10-12T23:22:19  <aarossig> amstan: try reducing the font-size please
2011-10-12T23:22:28  <amstan> sec
2011-10-12T23:22:51  <aarossig> amstan: found some more dubmood in a Razor keygen music folder -- it's awesome

2011-10-12T23:24:37  <aarossig> also.. those overlapping ants look horrible, move them down -- that might make all the difference
2011-10-12T23:24:51  <aarossig> oh! move them down + mirror in the Y-axis
2011-10-12T23:24:57  <aarossig> yes, that should do it
2011-10-12T23:25:25  <aarossig> then it will look like they are invading the word Google lol
2011-10-12T23:25:52  <amstan> perhaps we should move them to the left side
2011-10-12T23:25:58  <amstan> but do you really like the red?
2011-10-12T23:26:01  <aarossig> yeah
2011-10-12T23:26:03  <aarossig> looks good
2011-10-12T23:26:05  <amstan> i don't think it looks professional enough
2011-10-12T23:26:26  <aarossig> they should be on the right, and something cool on the left
2011-10-12T23:26:34  <aarossig> maybe a larger ant
2011-10-12T23:26:40  <aarossig> or.. some kind of site statistic
2011-10-12T23:26:57  <aarossig> or a few site statistics, in a very small font
2011-10-12T23:27:11  <aarossig> monospace font too
2011-10-12T23:27:12  <amstan> it looks cleaner on that side without them
2011-10-12T23:27:14  <aarossig> hmm..
2011-10-12T23:27:43  <aarossig> idk.. it is cleaner but now it's more boring
2011-10-12T23:27:48  *** okayzed is now known as okay
2011-10-12T23:27:57  <aarossig> try mirror across the Y-axis and move them down slightly
2011-10-12T23:28:11  <aarossig> brb, water
2011-10-12T23:35:04  <aarossig> amstan: okay, i'm going to bed -- work tomorrow
2011-10-12T23:35:12  <aarossig> cya
2011-10-12T23:35:30  <amstan> k
2011-10-12T23:35:32  <amstan> cya
2011-10-12T23:56:03  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mleise i made you a mod on the forums
2011-10-12T23:56:03  <contestbot> amstan: As you wish.
2011-10-12T23:56:56  <jbroman> @later tell contestbot @later tell jbroman test
2011-10-12T23:56:56  <contestbot> jbroman: Error: I can't send notes to myself.
2011-10-12T23:56:59  <jbroman> Aww.
2011-10-12T23:57:46  <amstan> hmm
2011-10-12T23:57:52  <amstan> yeah.. doesn't work
2011-10-12T23:57:57  <amstan> now?
2011-10-12T23:58:02  <amstan> jbroman: problem is that @later tells are notices, not messages in the channel
2011-10-12T23:58:09  <amstan> so contestbot won't exec commands from those
2011-10-12T23:58:15  <jbroman> OIC
2011-10-12T23:58:24  <jbroman> Thought they were private messages.
2011-10-12T23:58:28  <jbroman> Meh.
2011-10-12T23:58:40  <amstan> they seemed nicer to be notices
2011-10-12T23:58:45  <amstan> there's a setting
2011-10-12T23:58:52  <jbroman> Don't really care.
2011-10-12T23:58:54  *** okay is now known as okayzed
2011-10-12T23:58:56  <jbroman> Was just curious if it would work.
2011-10-12T23:59:20  <amstan> i made a bot once which would execute any command in a pm
2011-10-12T23:59:27  <amstan> and reply with errors if there was an error
2011-10-12T23:59:33  <jbroman> as in shell exec?
2011-10-12T23:59:41  <amstan> no, just interpret
