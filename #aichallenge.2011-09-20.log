2011-09-20T06:28:53  <eashoka> janzert : what if we set the starting skill of a new version (of a bot) to what it is already instead of forcing it to come up from 0. It is far more likely that the bot skill is around what it was rather than be near 0. This way, we wouldn't need ghost ranking as well. Impact on other bots also would be greatly reduced (other bots loosing on skill level by playing against a bot which is considerably lower ranked than it's actu
2011-09-20T06:34:00  <eashoka> janzert : There may be a very good reason why it is done in the way it's done at the moment. So, thought of running it against you b4 posting a possible annoyingly late feature request :-) anybody else who know why a new version of a bot has to come from ground up instead of starting from where it was ?

2011-09-20T07:02:09  <mcstar> i suppose if a bot did get worse, than it was b4 than maybe it would reach its lower ranking in a greater time than if it was started from the bottom
2011-09-20T07:02:45  <mcstar> i stress suppose, i dont know
2011-09-20T07:03:27  <mcstar> although, there are 2 parameters in computing trueskill, maybe it would be enough to only reset sigma, and still get a decent behavior

2011-09-20T08:02:00  <mcstar> delt0r: are you familiar with fft?
2011-09-20T08:02:12  <mcstar> (dumb question, sure you are :))
2011-09-20T08:10:47  <delt0r> yes
2011-09-20T08:10:52  <delt0r> fft ftw
2011-09-20T08:11:00  <delt0r> oh yea fftw
2011-09-20T08:11:01  <mcstar> fftw ftw
2011-09-20T08:11:08  <delt0r> lol
2011-09-20T08:11:12  <mcstar> so
2011-09-20T08:11:40  <delt0r> ...
2011-09-20T08:11:48  <mcstar> im wondering if you consider fft-ing a signal and extracting its 0-component vs. integrating with a more sophisticated integrator
2011-09-20T08:12:07  <mcstar> considering if its good enough*
2011-09-20T08:12:21  <mcstar> sry, seems my english is broken today .)
2011-09-20T08:12:33  <delt0r> the zero component is just the DC level
2011-09-20T08:12:40  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-20T08:12:41  <delt0r> or the avarege
2011-09-20T08:12:46  <delt0r> avarage
2011-09-20T08:12:48  <mcstar> the integral of the series
2011-09-20T08:13:00  <delt0r> yea--up to a factor
2011-09-20T08:13:02  <mcstar> but im wondering about accuracy here
2011-09-20T08:13:10  <delt0r> it is identical
2011-09-20T08:13:20  <delt0r> for the zero component
2011-09-20T08:13:36  <delt0r> unless you go all complex numbers...
2011-09-20T08:13:38  <mcstar> why?
2011-09-20T08:13:46  <delt0r> in which case it still is
2011-09-20T08:14:09  <mcstar> if the signal is almost harmonic than the error is low i imagine
2011-09-20T08:14:11  <delt0r> because cos(x*0) is always 1
2011-09-20T08:14:36  <mcstar> but i also think that a trpezoid rule, or simpson's or romberg's integrator gives better results
2011-09-20T08:14:54  <delt0r> hence the zero component is literally just the integral of the signal
2011-09-20T08:15:18  <mcstar> delt0r: that i know, i know the "interpretation"
2011-09-20T08:15:27  <delt0r> well with fft there is the "window" function
2011-09-20T08:15:31  <mcstar> im wondering if fft is accurate enough
2011-09-20T08:15:43  <delt0r> at the dc level this is == to the "interpolation" method
2011-09-20T08:16:14  <mcstar> basically its a linear interp.
2011-09-20T08:16:16  <mcstar> ok
2011-09-20T08:16:20  <delt0r> fft is perfectly reversible with the proper window function and bandwidth
2011-09-20T08:16:41  <mcstar> i know that, again thats not my question
2011-09-20T08:16:53  <delt0r> mcstar: not quite, the default "square" window is a sinc interpolator
2011-09-20T08:17:19  <mcstar> yeah, square goes to sinc in freq. doamin
2011-09-20T08:17:23  <delt0r> yep
2011-09-20T08:18:22  <delt0r> honestly it is not often a plain Euler integrator wouldn't be good enough for the DC
2011-09-20T08:18:23  <mcstar> so i guess its notbad, since it already involves minimal number of arithmetic(fft)
2011-09-20T08:18:43  <delt0r> well not if you only want one component of the result
2011-09-20T08:18:56  <mcstar> i already have the fft of the signal
2011-09-20T08:18:59  <delt0r> since fft is n log n
2011-09-20T08:19:11  <delt0r> and a single component is just n
2011-09-20T08:19:16  <delt0r> oh ic
2011-09-20T08:19:17  <mcstar> and for 1 component its not more than an integrator
2011-09-20T08:19:24  <delt0r> yes
2011-09-20T08:19:30  <mcstar> the number of floating point operations that is
2011-09-20T08:19:40  <delt0r> why are you asking... you seem to know as much as i do?
2011-09-20T08:19:54  <mcstar> ?

2011-09-20T08:20:06  <mcstar> one can always learn
2011-09-20T08:20:13  <delt0r> well for non dc components there is a extra *
2011-09-20T08:20:17  <delt0r> sure
2011-09-20T08:20:28  <delt0r> but its nothing really
2011-09-20T08:20:37  <mcstar> for example i misread numpy.fft manual
2011-09-20T08:21:01  <mcstar> this is how it maps k: [0 1 2 3 -3 -2 -1]
2011-09-20T08:21:11  <mcstar> but i interpreted it as [0 1 2 3 -1 -2 -3]
2011-09-20T08:21:11  <delt0r> odd
2011-09-20T08:21:44  <delt0r> i wrote a fft for my school project once
2011-09-20T08:21:46  <mcstar> its just a toy project, the real one uses cufft
2011-09-20T08:23:01  <mcstar> fft or dft?
2011-09-20T08:23:42  * mcstar is wonderign wheather it was cooley-tuckey or just summing exponentials
2011-09-20T08:23:57  <delt0r> my one? or what should you use?
2011-09-20T08:24:01  <delt0r> it was fft
2011-09-20T08:24:15  <delt0r> any power of 2
2011-09-20T08:24:27  <delt0r> full complex fft
2011-09-20T08:24:51  <delt0r> in fact what is dft?
2011-09-20T08:25:03  <mcstar> yours yes
2011-09-20T08:25:12  <mcstar> discrete fourier transform
2011-09-20T08:25:25  <delt0r> all fft must be discrete
2011-09-20T08:25:31  <mcstar> lol
2011-09-20T08:25:33  <mcstar> of course
2011-09-20T08:25:43  <mcstar> but fft is a dft
2011-09-20T08:25:52  <mcstar> and it has the nlogn characterstic
2011-09-20T08:25:58  <mcstar> the dft has n2 is think
2011-09-20T08:26:03  <delt0r> well i would use the d for things like dct
2011-09-20T08:26:07  <delt0r> or dst
2011-09-20T08:26:30  <mcstar> delt0r: dft is a common acronym
2011-09-20T08:26:34  <delt0r> well the fft only works for 2^n samples for any n
2011-09-20T08:26:44  <delt0r> never came across it sorry
2011-09-20T08:26:55  <delt0r> did real signal processing too
2011-09-20T08:27:15  <delt0r> and physics and 2 years EE
2011-09-20T08:27:21  <mcstar> cufft has an fft impl. that works for 2^n*3^m*5^k*7^p
2011-09-20T08:27:56  <delt0r> i would pretty much only use fftw now, it optimizes for whatever your n is
2011-09-20T08:28:08  <delt0r> but casting the problem in powers of 2 is not hard either
2011-09-20T08:28:29  <delt0r> in fact nowdays its pretty much R or matlab
2011-09-20T08:28:38  <delt0r> R uses fftw iirc
2011-09-20T08:29:00  <mcstar> i hate matlab, i rather use python, even if im not satisfied
2011-09-20T08:29:14  <delt0r> these days its 99% R
2011-09-20T08:29:26  <mcstar> but for 512^3 domains you cant really use any of it
2011-09-20T08:29:35  <delt0r> .8% mathmatica and .2% matlab --its what ppl send me
2011-09-20T08:29:55  <mcstar> i liked mathematica when i was young
2011-09-20T08:30:06  <mcstar> i even corrected a prof. that came to lecture about it
2011-09-20T08:30:18  <delt0r> well it is free for me... site license
2011-09-20T08:30:25  <delt0r> so is matlab.
2011-09-20T08:30:35  <mcstar> noob, didnt know he had to use ()'s for a plainfunction to use it correctly
2011-09-20T08:30:37  <delt0r> and MS word for that matter... but i don't touch that
2011-09-20T08:31:23  <delt0r> well i get that all the time... you are told 1 day before the class, that you need to give a lecture on XXX
2011-09-20T08:31:32  <delt0r> only you have never done/used XXX
2011-09-20T08:32:01  <delt0r> So i ask the students to correct me :)
2011-09-20T08:32:02  <mcstar> he was giving these 1 week lecture course regularly at the time, and was quite confident about it
2011-09-20T08:32:16  <mcstar> but it doesnt matter
2011-09-20T08:32:26  <mcstar> basically what he did, was some visualizations
2011-09-20T08:32:40  <mcstar> that was the most interesting part, but it gave my some credits so..
2011-09-20T08:32:56  <delt0r> don't like mathmatica for that. sure its nice, but getting them out of mathmatica is a PITA
2011-09-20T08:33:35  <mcstar> really?
2011-09-20T08:33:46  <mcstar> i even used it to convert a bunch of images to pdf at one time :)
2011-09-20T08:33:47  <delt0r> yea--at least for publication quality
2011-09-20T08:33:53  <delt0r> perhaps the have fixed it now
2011-09-20T08:34:00  <delt0r> but it really was a pain
2011-09-20T08:34:08  <mcstar> well, those graphs look real good
2011-09-20T08:34:20  <mcstar> but it was hard to annotate in the past
2011-09-20T08:34:31  <delt0r> R works for me. and easier to import etc
2011-09-20T08:34:33  <mcstar> but nowadays, its can be edited in the gui
2011-09-20T08:34:34  <delt0r> and free
2011-09-20T08:35:09  <mcstar> but i didnt use mma for that, i liked the very fast prototyping in it
2011-09-20T08:35:28  <delt0r> I use to check my math
2011-09-20T08:35:34  <delt0r> I use it
2011-09-20T08:35:36  <mcstar> that too
2011-09-20T08:35:55  <mcstar> it gives the best results, no arguing about that
2011-09-20T08:36:04  <delt0r> esp the tedious stuff...
2011-09-20T08:36:20  <mcstar> i computed several integrals with it for which maxima or maple didnt give as nice results, if gave at all

2011-09-20T08:39:51  <mcstar> delt0r: btw there are some practical differences between the discussed two methods it seems, but its too much to discuss it over irc i guess
2011-09-20T08:40:00  <mcstar> end-point related
2011-09-20T08:41:12  <delt0r> you mean with fft vers integration for one component
2011-09-20T08:41:48  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-20T08:41:58  <mcstar> ok i tell it
2011-09-20T08:42:14  <mcstar> lets say i have a sine wave, discretized over 2pi
2011-09-20T08:42:35  <delt0r> i would not think this would affect the dc component... ie the 2 different ways of doing boundary conditions in ffts
2011-09-20T08:42:42  <mcstar> and its important for the fft, for the signal to be truly periodic
2011-09-20T08:42:50  <delt0r> but the rest, yes i think it would
2011-09-20T08:42:54  <mcstar> meaning ar[N]==ar[0]
2011-09-20T08:43:16  <mcstar> but if i use an integrater, that gives a very large error if dx is not very small
2011-09-20T08:43:35  <delt0r> yea--and there is the ar[-N]==ar[N] iirc... it has been a while since i cared about that level of detail
2011-09-20T08:43:42  <mcstar> because it would expect ar[0]==ar[N-1]
2011-09-20T08:44:20  <delt0r> ?? why would you expect that?
2011-09-20T08:44:28  <delt0r> why whould it
2011-09-20T08:44:33  <delt0r> damit
2011-09-20T08:44:43  <mcstar> :)
2011-09-20T08:45:55  <mcstar> well, in numpy it seems trapz and simps both work this way
2011-09-20T08:46:30  <mcstar> anyway, they give 2 magnitude worse results
2011-09-20T08:46:33  <mcstar> than the fft
2011-09-20T08:46:48  <mcstar> 1e-14 vs. 1e-16
2011-09-20T08:47:06  <delt0r> oh crap... that is not 2 real orders of mag
2011-09-20T08:47:14  <delt0r> that is double level noise
2011-09-20T08:47:18  <mcstar> thats obviously because the signal is very good for the fft, since its a sine
2011-09-20T08:47:37  <delt0r> yea-- but in general i would not count on it
2011-09-20T08:47:50  <mcstar> what did you mean by that?
2011-09-20T08:48:08  <delt0r> i know some would claim doubles are 1e-16... but reality is that for many things 1e-10 is dreaming
2011-09-20T08:48:39  <mcstar> well, i guess i could shift the signal to be all positive at least
2011-09-20T08:49:15  <delt0r> however for the record Gaussian quadrature can get very highly accurate results --but 1e-16 is still dreaming for the general case IMO
2011-09-20T08:49:45  <mcstar> yes, i wont argue with that
2011-09-20T08:49:51  <delt0r> also consider SNR
2011-09-20T08:50:07  <delt0r> if you sine wave has amplitude 1
2011-09-20T08:50:26  <delt0r> that is mmm forgot my dB
2011-09-20T08:50:46  <delt0r> 14 orders of magnatude is that like 70dB?
2011-09-20T08:50:49  <delt0r> or 140dB
2011-09-20T08:51:32  <mcstar> dunno
2011-09-20T08:51:39  <delt0r> huge either way
2011-09-20T08:51:57  <mcstar> 1 db is a 21x factor?
2011-09-20T08:52:01  <mcstar> i remember something like this
2011-09-20T08:52:08  <delt0r> 3dB is a factor of 2
2011-09-20T08:52:13  <mcstar> shat
2011-09-20T08:52:21  <mcstar> sry i didnt use db in many years
2011-09-20T08:52:27  <mcstar> only in electronics lab
2011-09-20T08:52:28  <delt0r> neither
2011-09-20T08:52:35  <mcstar> at that time i knew it
2011-09-20T08:52:37  * delt0r googles
2011-09-20T08:53:17  <delt0r> yea its 140 dB
2011-09-20T08:53:56  <delt0r> nope
2011-09-20T08:53:59  <delt0r> 70
2011-09-20T08:54:05  <delt0r> oh who cares
2011-09-20T08:54:10  <delt0r> dB is lame anyway
2011-09-20T08:54:16  * delt0r does some work
2011-09-20T08:54:24  <mcstar> ah yes, -2db is for halfing the amplitude
2011-09-20T08:54:29  <mcstar> some like that i remember
2011-09-20T08:54:47  <mcstar> 140
2011-09-20T08:54:55  <mcstar> hell -3db*
2011-09-20T09:00:07  <mcstar> well, log10(2)~3.3
2011-09-20T09:00:22  <mcstar> anyway its -140db
2011-09-20T09:01:15  <mcstar> ah yes, gain=20log(a1/a2)
2011-09-20T09:01:23  <mcstar>  gain=20log10(a1/a2)

2011-09-20T13:25:04  <McLeopold> janzert: I see a traceback for the utf8 issue
2011-09-20T13:25:28  <janzert> great
2011-09-20T13:25:53  <McLeopold> I think it may be a bad username?
2011-09-20T13:26:07  <McLeopold> it's when the json encoding happens
2011-09-20T13:27:28  <McLeopold> no, usernames are not known by the worker
2011-09-20T13:27:40  <McLeopold> maybe something in stdout or stderr from a bot is writing unicode?
2011-09-20T13:27:46  <McLeopold> but only sometimes?
2011-09-20T13:28:29  <janzert> well the problem is that something is trying to interpret something as unicode when it isn't ;)
2011-09-20T13:28:31  <McLeopold> so, info from the bots needs to go through sanitization before being sent back
2011-09-20T13:31:36  <McLeopold> janzert: how in sync are the times on the workers and server?
2011-09-20T13:32:26  <janzert> not sure, I would suspect that the global time is pretty close but the timezones are different
2011-09-20T13:32:51  <McLeopold> can you tell me the matchup id the worker processed just before the crash?
2011-09-20T13:33:02  <janzert> yeah looks like worker is UTC
2011-09-20T13:33:14  <janzert> so add 4 hours to get beta server time
2011-09-20T13:33:46  <janzert> 305954
2011-09-20T13:34:19  <McLeopold> oh, "trying to reset mysql..."
2011-09-20T13:34:32  <McLeopold> sometimes the php mysqli fails
2011-09-20T13:35:12  <McLeopold> did both workers go down?
2011-09-20T13:35:29  <janzert> just one
2011-09-20T13:35:34  <janzert> 205
2011-09-20T13:36:00  <McLeopold> okay, I'm not sure what to do about php, but the worker should just wait 20 seconds and try again
2011-09-20T13:38:03  <janzert> hmm, quick read of worker.py:task() I would think that's what it would do already

2011-09-20T13:39:55  <McLeopold> okay, 2 more bugs on the worker, then we are really solid!

2011-09-20T13:42:19  <McLeopold> knock on wood
2011-09-20T13:44:05  <McLeopold> janzert: how about everything gathered from the bots is converted to utf8 right away, if there are errors, then the line is throw out?

2011-09-20T13:44:49  <delt0r_> are some bots putting out illegal uft8 chars
2011-09-20T13:44:54  <McLeopold> just one
2011-09-20T13:45:10  <janzert> let me look at it some more
2011-09-20T13:45:27  <delt0r_> yea--inputs should be sanitized
2011-09-20T13:45:37  * delt0r_ looks at my engine
2011-09-20T13:45:44  * delt0r_ looks at his engine
2011-09-20T13:46:07  <McLeopold> janzert: line 140 in worker, but the replay object has the bad data
2011-09-20T13:46:18  <delt0r_> random binary data from the bot should get a kick right?
2011-09-20T13:46:21  <janzert> unfortunately the one traceback we have is when the worker tried to send a result that it had from a saved result
2011-09-20T13:46:26  <janzert> not the initial try
2011-09-20T13:46:26  <McLeopold> we could at least try to dump it to see what is happening
2011-09-20T13:46:35  <mcstar> sign of insanity when one refers to himself in the third place, /me doesnt help people stay sane
2011-09-20T13:46:48  <delt0r_> lol
2011-09-20T13:47:05  * McLeopold types /me
2011-09-20T13:47:19  <mcstar> well,its funny, just dont get used to it
2011-09-20T13:47:55  <UncleVasya> Here was no activity for a long time earlier but now it's "wow!". Almost all issues are closed now, Thanks organizers/contributors.

2011-09-20T13:53:37  <McLeopold> janzert: how do I grep for unicode?
2011-09-20T13:55:01  <mcstar> pcregrep?
2011-09-20T14:01:25  <janzert> ?
2011-09-20T14:01:50  <McLeopold> I was looking at the submission that causes the issue to see if there was anything obvious
2011-09-20T14:02:38  <janzert> the problem we're seeing is that the json encoder is running into something that isn't unicode, probably binary data
2011-09-20T14:03:02  <mcstar> McLeopold: pcregrep has the -u option to run in unicode mode
2011-09-20T14:03:05  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-20T14:03:18  <McLeopold> was really looking for latin-1 or something
2011-09-20T14:03:40  <McLeopold> it has to be something the bot is outputting, since it is only the one bot some of the time
2011-09-20T14:03:56  <mcstar> what language is it written in?
2011-09-20T14:04:10  <McLeopold> cpp
2011-09-20T14:04:24  <delt0r_> McLeopold: you can't really
2011-09-20T14:04:41  <delt0r_> there are a few illegal byte sequences... but that it
2011-09-20T14:04:46  <McLeopold> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=22
2011-09-20T14:04:58  <delt0r_> a short random set of bytes still has a good chance of passing
2011-09-20T14:05:07  <delt0r_> ie being legal utf8
2011-09-20T14:05:10  <McLeopold> I now know a way of preventing any losses from being recorded by the system.  I can now cheat my way to a win!
2011-09-20T14:05:22  <janzert> the result has an 0xff byte, that is probably coming from the bot but we don't really know that for sure
2011-09-20T14:05:50  <delt0r_> yea--a 0xff byte without a 0x70 is illegal iirc
2011-09-20T14:06:20  <delt0r_> 0xffff is also illegal... but 0x70ff is fine IIRC
2011-09-20T14:06:45  <delt0r_> can't you just catch the exception?
2011-09-20T14:06:51  <delt0r_> that is what i am doing
2011-09-20T14:07:03  <janzert> what we should do is encode the bot output to unicode using a replacement strategy so illegal bytes are replaced with the unicode replacement character
2011-09-20T14:07:07  <delt0r_> any excpetion in io/parsing gets the bot kicked
2011-09-20T14:08:06  <delt0r_> the best would be to restrict it to utf8 the first 128 codes
2011-09-20T14:08:09  <mcstar> 0x70ffffff is nan isnt it?
2011-09-20T14:08:11  <delt0r_> aka ascii
2011-09-20T14:08:14  <mcstar> i dealt with something similar
2011-09-20T14:08:22  <delt0r_> its the easiest...
2011-09-20T14:08:42  <delt0r_> mcstar: you may be right
2011-09-20T14:08:50  <janzert> we allow real unicode most places already
2011-09-20T14:08:51  <delt0r_> there are 3 byte codes in utf8
2011-09-20T14:09:04  <delt0r_> right...
2011-09-20T14:10:05  <delt0r_> I was just looking it up... other than catch the exception, you have to check the byte stream legal ness
2011-09-20T14:10:17  <UncleVasya> Loool, it's my friend. I can bring him here.
2011-09-20T14:10:39  <UncleVasya> Imean user=22
2011-09-20T14:10:44  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-20T14:10:45  <delt0r_> which can include all 255 bytes...
2011-09-20T14:10:55  <McLeopold> maybe he can explain why his bot would do that?
2011-09-20T14:12:06  <UncleVasya> He will come here in few minutes.
2011-09-20T14:13:06  <McLeopold> janzert: we also have a sandbox error come up occasionally.  It's at line 290 of engine.py, during the cleanup.  I suspect we ought to just catch that error?
2011-09-20T14:13:22  <janzert> no
2011-09-20T14:13:42  <janzert> I saw that but haven't looked into it yet
2011-09-20T14:13:45  <McLeopold> but it prevents the game from being posted, and that is after the game was played

2011-09-20T14:22:10  <delt0r_> java automagically replaces illegal sequences of bytes with a ?
2011-09-20T14:22:27  <mcstar> (i was wrong, nan is 0x7fff.....)
2011-09-20T14:22:29  <janzert> was that yes I can blow away the changes?
2011-09-20T14:22:56  <janzert> delt0r_: python can do it too if you tell it to ;)
2011-09-20T14:23:01  <McLeopold> janzert: is self._signal("KILL") synchronous?
2011-09-20T14:23:09  <delt0r_> I am sure it could
2011-09-20T14:23:12  <McLeopold> janzert: yes
2011-09-20T14:23:20  <delt0r_> I would expect it too in fact
2011-09-20T14:23:36  <delt0r_> but at least my engine is "safe" ;)
2011-09-20T14:23:55  <InsaneMalkavian> It's very unlikely. I didn't use it afaik

2011-09-20T14:27:43  <delt0r_> well my engine was safe *while* the default encoding is utf-8. It is not on mac... so that is fixed
2011-09-20T14:29:10  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm going to set InsaneMalkavian as the seed player for every game, so we can test this
2011-09-20T14:29:11  <delt0r_> oh, how are "finished" ants dealt with --ie all their ants are dead.. I keep giving them turn X;go and waiting for go
2011-09-20T14:29:41  <delt0r_> finished bots i mean
2011-09-20T14:29:44  <McLeopold> we give them a full state, then we kill the process
2011-09-20T14:29:57  <InsaneMalkavian> I used cpp starter package and just slightly modified bot::makemovea
2011-09-20T14:31:29  <janzert> ok, next time we get a utf traceback there should also be a corresponding pickle of the result object on the worker
2011-09-20T14:31:30  <delt0r_> McLeopold: the full state at the time their last ant dies?

2011-09-20T14:51:51  <delt0r_> Code is always the oracle
2011-09-20T14:52:48  <berak> delt0r_,  it's plus end\n..scores..\ngo\n (the go part comes from the worker)
2011-09-20T14:53:29  <delt0r_> so the worker can still "timeout" on an end
2011-09-20T14:53:33  <delt0r_> interesting
2011-09-20T14:57:02  <berak> but any information after 'end\n' will hardly reach any bot, since most starter kits just shut off after receiving  'end'

2011-09-20T16:18:03  <cichociemno> McLeopold: Hi, Can you look at submissions on my profile? http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/profile.php?user=793 That's quite strange problem. I was testing on my local, even with the same config and it was working. I checked, and suppose that problem is in reading input.
2011-09-20T16:19:00  <olexs> cichociemno: did you run tesh_bot.cmd / test_bot.sh on your bot?
2011-09-20T16:19:34  <cichociemno> olexs: Yes, i run it. Everything was ok.
2011-09-20T16:20:29  <olexs> ok, just checking :)
2011-09-20T16:21:40  <cichociemno> olexs: I was trying to figure out where is the problem. For a tests i put while loop printing "go\n" command all the time. It looks like it didn't receive "ready" command after reading config in turn 0.
2011-09-20T16:23:43  <olexs> are you using the C++ starter kit or did you write the reader-parser code yourself?
2011-09-20T16:23:57  <cichociemno> olexs: I saw that you were talking about "unicode" support. Is it possible that you send to bot input unicode string? Cause I write in C++, it doesn't support unic..
2011-09-20T16:24:35  <cichociemno> olexs: I started from starter and keep changing it. Until some point it was working great.
2011-09-20T16:25:22  <olexs> I'm not an admin and don't know that for sure. However, unicode bytes for ascii symbols should be the same as ansi, afaik
2011-09-20T16:27:11  <cichociemno> olexs: Thanks for help, I will try to find it.
2011-09-20T16:27:49  <olexs> cichociemno: no problem :)
2011-09-20T16:28:34  <McLeopold> cichociemno: do you write to stderr?
2011-09-20T16:28:52  <cichociemno> olexs: But in fact I have no idea where the problem is. I was even thinking that maybe the output from game engine is not flushed?
2011-09-20T16:29:03  <cichociemno> McLeopold: No.

2011-09-20T17:00:47  <Keth> McLeopold / olexs, Hi. After recent changes (last 1 hour), my bot started crashing for no reason. There were 100 games in a row, all survived and not a single crash. Now after the database was cleaned, my bot crashed 2 times within 5 minutes. I just wanted to report this and maybe ask why does this happen?
2011-09-20T17:01:48  <janzert> hmm, more likely that is a result of the sandbox changes I just made
2011-09-20T17:01:58  <olexs> Keth: as I said above, I'm not an admin :) but still, what's your username/id on the server?
2011-09-20T17:01:59  <janzert> what's the username on the server?
2011-09-20T17:02:07  <Keth> user 694
2011-09-20T17:02:12  <Keth> bot name kwketh
2011-09-20T17:02:39  <McLeopold> janzert: I got the fix, hold on
2011-09-20T17:05:37  <janzert> although I would expect any problems with the sandbox change to manifest in most or all games
2011-09-20T17:07:18  <McLeopold> you can't pass a None to unicode()
2011-09-20T17:07:31  <McLeopold> and I just messed up my commit :(
2011-09-20T17:07:39  <janzert> I already fixed that
2011-09-20T17:07:45  <Keth> is this related to my problem?
2011-09-20T17:09:01  <janzert> I don't think so, if McLeopold is referring to what I think he's referring to ;)
2011-09-20T17:10:08  <janzert> McLeopold: did you see this commit? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/ad287169f48f08b4f92ceda0ff70a5243189ee5e
2011-09-20T17:11:16  <Keth> so no more crashes or is the unicode fix something completely different?
2011-09-20T17:11:44  <janzert> that fix should prevent the whole engine from crashing, not just one of the bots
2011-09-20T17:12:01  <janzert> so shouldn't be the cause of just your bot crashing in the game :(
2011-09-20T17:14:38  <Keth> hm ok. I will keep an eye on this issue then
