2011-09-19T00:00:12  <McLeopold> actually, I need to set it to compile, I think...
2011-09-19T00:02:02  <janzert> McLeopold: were you going to delete matchup 266777?
2011-09-19T00:02:18  <McLeopold> idk
2011-09-19T00:02:25  <McLeopold> sure
2011-09-19T00:02:26  <janzert> or somehow mark it to stop being retried forever
2011-09-19T00:02:34  <McLeopold> oh, still doing that?
2011-09-19T00:02:56  <janzert> just noticed that demerzel still hadn't gotten a game actually :)
2011-09-19T00:03:08  <janzert> as I was closing some of my browser tabs
2011-09-19T00:03:08  <McLeopold> I'll set it to my worker :)
2011-09-19T00:03:21  <McLeopold> then I can mess with it
2011-09-19T00:04:05  <janzert> but we figured out that it will never succeed since the player_id is all -1

2011-09-19T00:06:18  <McLeopold> you submitted twice today?  the same bot?
2011-09-19T00:06:48  <ChrisH> sort of, one was trying to put all the code into a single source file, but the logic was the same for both
2011-09-19T00:07:24  <ChrisH> all they do is reply "go" for each turn and make no moves.

2011-09-19T01:32:00  <antimatroid> janzert: what do you think about naming these "symmetric maps" as symmetric or fair?
2011-09-19T01:32:47  <antimatroid> i am naming symmetric concepts more generally for normal form games for my honours thesis and have basically decided to name the equivalent idea as fair but not symmetric, even though there are isomorphisms which are symmetries of the game
2011-09-19T01:33:17  <janzert> for the contest I'd rather keep the name symmetric
2011-09-19T01:33:51  <antimatroid> yep fair enough
2011-09-19T01:34:05  <antimatroid> if i had done this already back then i probably would have called them fair :P
2011-09-19T01:34:09  <antimatroid> but i don't really care

2011-09-19T01:37:54  <antimatroid> okay, but somewhere it needs to say the maps are symmetric

2011-09-19T03:51:41  <sir_macelon> McLeopold: Moreover some games have too low food spawn rate, I believe and generate a bit of random results, as there are periods where there's no food on the map and it is rather a matter who gets lucky to have food spawned close to his ants
2011-09-19T03:52:59  <sir_macelon> McLeopold: Most of those games weren't finished by the 1500 turn limit

2011-09-19T04:48:34  <mcstar> it seems fft hates me
2011-09-19T04:54:37  <mleise> mcstar: I hope the games don't end up with all bots avoiding each other and turning into a gas mix physics simulation.
2011-09-19T04:56:11  <mleise> The fact that you have an unknown number > 1 of opponents makes everyone careful about loosing any ants. Aggressive players will just lose their ants to other players early.
2011-09-19T04:57:40  <mcstar> some time ago i think most of the top bots did exactly this
2011-09-19T04:57:47  <mcstar> they avoided each other
2011-09-19T04:58:00  <mcstar> but, obviously this isnt a winning strategy
2011-09-19T04:58:35  <mcstar> hopefully, those who have participated in beta will beat this obstacle first
2011-09-19T04:58:43  <mleise> no of course not, but it is better than loosing all the time ;)
2011-09-19T04:58:57  <mcstar> i mean they will be the first ones with a nice battle strategy
2011-09-19T04:59:35  <mleise> Show me a game where battles do not only occur about a) a food item or b) close to the turn limit, to get some points
2011-09-19T04:59:58  <mcstar> i have 3 ideas regarding battle so far
2011-09-19T05:00:02  <mleise> shoot
2011-09-19T05:00:07  <mcstar> one was like what revolt does
2011-09-19T05:00:28  <mcstar> he inflates, then the repells other ants from his domain
2011-09-19T05:00:44  <mcstar> so those ants will fight more among themselves, so he spares his ants
2011-09-19T05:00:59  <mcstar> what i wanted, to do something like this, but to use aggressively water
2011-09-19T05:01:13  <mcstar> meaning that block corridors, and start the pressure from there
2011-09-19T05:01:29  <mcstar> and push enemies to water, where their degree of freedom decreses
2011-09-19T05:01:35  <mcstar> so they will be easier to kill
2011-09-19T05:01:43  <mcstar> another one, is fishing
2011-09-19T05:02:19  <mcstar> you guard a food from as far as possible, with multiple ants, and the enemies path becomes more predictable when it reaches for food...
2011-09-19T05:02:31  <mleise> haha, nice idea
2011-09-19T05:02:34  <mcstar> the third one is chase down strategy
2011-09-19T05:03:03  <mleise> but yeah using water as a natural border is an obvious strategy
2011-09-19T05:03:13  <mcstar> 2 ants start chasing 1-2 enemy ants, and some other will coordinate together to come from the opposite direction, to catch the running ones
2011-09-19T05:03:49  <mcstar> i didnt find any other way, to make the moves of the enemy ants more predictable
2011-09-19T05:03:50  <mleise> they will just eat your 1 support ant
2011-09-19T05:03:54  <mcstar> no
2011-09-19T05:04:03  <mleise> yes
2011-09-19T05:04:05  <mcstar> obviously numbers matter
2011-09-19T05:04:11  <mcstar> but it can be made right
2011-09-19T05:04:25  <mleise> if they don't stop running they crush your ant
2011-09-19T05:04:44  <mcstar> but maybe there will be more ants waiting
2011-09-19T05:05:09  <mcstar> it will be very hard, cause the environment is very very dynamic
2011-09-19T05:05:19  <mcstar> and hard to choose from these strategies
2011-09-19T05:05:35  <mleise> ok, that is what some Dolphins do with fish swarms. Most of them drive the fish, while a few go have a meal
2011-09-19T05:05:41  <mcstar> (i mean to actually write this)
2011-09-19T05:06:00  <mcstar> why the captial d?
2011-09-19T05:06:15  <mcstar> is it your friend Dolphin?
2011-09-19T05:06:18  <mleise> don't know ... some german relic
2011-09-19T05:06:21  <mcstar> aha
2011-09-19T05:06:32  <mcstar> ah yes, capitalized nouns right?
2011-09-19T05:06:34  <mcstar> i forgot

2011-09-19T05:06:55  <mleise> right, all the time. but I see those come up in english as well. looking at menu entries in Eclipse for example

2011-09-19T05:07:06  <mcstar> lol
2011-09-19T05:07:32  <mcstar> i see, you breathe eclipse
2011-09-19T05:08:05  <mleise> uh no... I just wrote some README.txt describing how someone would get the visualizer project running in the IDE
2011-09-19T05:08:27  <mleise> and I realized they wrote "Build Path" and stuff like that
2011-09-19T05:08:34  <mcstar> i dont understand that framework, so its no use to tell me :)
2011-09-19T05:08:51  <mleise> what framework? :D
2011-09-19T05:09:00  <mcstar> thats whole java world
2011-09-19T05:09:15  <mcstar> hey, i think im going to develop software
2011-09-19T05:09:22  *** eashoka <eashoka!dcf7e114@gateway/web/freenode/ip.220.247.225.20> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-19T05:09:24  <mleise> good idea, bye
2011-09-19T05:09:25  <mcstar> sonn i will give some firms my resume
2011-09-19T05:09:38  <mcstar> bye?
2011-09-19T05:09:40  <mcstar> you going?
2011-09-19T05:09:46  <mleise> I thought you were coding now?
2011-09-19T05:09:55  <eashoka> mleise : resume ?
2011-09-19T05:10:01  <mcstar> but thats for scientific purposes
2011-09-19T05:10:16  <mleise> eashoka: CV
2011-09-19T05:10:22  <eashoka> mleise : just joined and saw you this resume talk. :-)
2011-09-19T05:11:13  <mcstar> resumeé
2011-09-19T05:11:18  <mcstar> correctly i think
2011-09-19T05:11:19  <mcstar> nvm
2011-09-19T05:11:32  <mcstar> cv is more practical :)
2011-09-19T05:11:45  <eashoka> mleise : just joined and saw you doing this resume talk. :-) heh heh. changing jobs ?
2011-09-19T05:12:03  <mcstar> mleise: people amuse me sometimes
2011-09-19T05:12:05  <mleise> mcstar is.
2011-09-19T05:12:37  <mleise> You wouldn't believe what shows up in the D newsgroup sometimes
2011-09-19T05:12:56  <mcstar> btw, the first firm is called dolphio
2011-09-19T05:12:59  <mleise> Trolls, drunks, advertisers
2011-09-19T05:13:06  <eashoka> BTW, I have a series issue to present to you guys. have a look at this game : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=188078&user=264
2011-09-19T05:13:31  <eashoka> mcstar : so whom r u quitting on ?
2011-09-19T05:13:36  <mcstar> mleise: you envy them cause you are just a regular guy?
2011-09-19T05:13:42  <mleise> I see stupid bots.. they still actually *fight* ;)
2011-09-19T05:13:50  <mcstar> eashoka: academia probably
2011-09-19T05:14:16  <eashoka> mcstar : aha... welcome to the hard working real world then!
2011-09-19T05:14:28  <mcstar> hm
2011-09-19T05:14:36  <mcstar> its not soo easy you know here
2011-09-19T05:14:49  <mcstar> a paper doesnt write itself
2011-09-19T05:14:50  <mleise> mcstar: It is really amazing, but I rather not do crazy stuff where it will forever be visible to the world if they only search long enough ;)
2011-09-19T05:15:20  <eashoka> in that game, the issue is any bot can win by committing hara-kiri (kamikaze to be precise) towards the end of turn limit
2011-09-19T05:15:37  <mleise> eashoka: Yes that was my point b) above
2011-09-19T05:16:25  <eashoka> mleise : can't blame bots for doing that, they are just using the rules to their benefit.
2011-09-19T05:16:45  <mcstar> harakiri is suicide, kamikaze, is dying while killing someone else
2011-09-19T05:16:48  <mleise> That's right, they try to keep alive for the showdown
2011-09-19T05:17:09  <eashoka> the reason why this is possible is that current rules pay no attention to the fact that who the real victor after a battle is. (ideally it should be the one who survies)
2011-09-19T05:17:33  <mcstar> who doesnt survive cant be the winner
2011-09-19T05:17:59  <mcstar> and the bots doesnt know when will the game end
2011-09-19T05:18:02  <mcstar> or do they?
2011-09-19T05:18:04  <eashoka> we don't count the remaining ants in the end but just give 2 points for a kill. so this is possible
2011-09-19T05:18:08  <mleise> they do know
2011-09-19T05:18:11  <mcstar> really?
2011-09-19T05:18:14  <mcstar> f
2011-09-19T05:18:18  <eashoka> of course they know
2011-09-19T05:18:19  <mcstar> thats stupid
2011-09-19T05:18:24  <mcstar> dont send it
2011-09-19T05:19:45  <eashoka> any bot can count the turns and do the math and decide/guess when should the turn limit arrive for that particular map.
2011-09-19T05:19:53  <mleise> they will still assume a limit like 1500 turns
2011-09-19T05:20:08  <mcstar> that probably will be incorrect
2011-09-19T05:20:21  <mcstar> and yes, the bots should keep statistics for themselves
2011-09-19T05:20:24  <eashoka> look at that game, winning bot smartly get active towards 250th turn :-)
2011-09-19T05:20:34  <mcstar> if they can predict an end-game condition, good for them
2011-09-19T05:20:44  <mcstar> but im against to sending maxturns to them
2011-09-19T05:21:07  <eashoka> point is this is not proper fighting, defence or anything. kamikaze is no brainer!
2011-09-19T05:21:17  <mcstar> harakiri
2011-09-19T05:21:21  <mcstar> you mean suicide right?
2011-09-19T05:22:07  <eashoka> I mean killing one-one. that's pretty easy compared to trying kill more opponents than ur losses
2011-09-19T05:22:17  <mcstar> ok
2011-09-19T05:22:30  <eashoka> we are doing something unnatural here. that's why this strategy is possible
2011-09-19T05:22:31  <mcstar> well, the other one shouldn let itself get killed
2011-09-19T05:22:50  <mcstar> thats +2 for each the players
2011-09-19T05:22:50  <eashoka> in any real world battle, one would try to survive the battle and claim the victory
2011-09-19T05:22:55  <mcstar> thats not good enough :)
2011-09-19T05:23:06  <mcstar> each of*
2011-09-19T05:23:14  <eashoka> here, we award the victory disregarding whther the victor is alive or not :-)
2011-09-19T05:23:22  <mcstar> nono
2011-09-19T05:23:25  <mcstar> dont tell me
2011-09-19T05:23:34  <eashoka> mcstar : look at that game
2011-09-19T05:23:36  <mcstar> the winner can have 0 ants?
2011-09-19T05:23:52  <mcstar> we discussed it a very long time ago that its stupid
2011-09-19T05:23:58  <mcstar> mleise: do you remember?
2011-09-19T05:24:16  <mleise> no that's been too long
2011-09-19T05:24:35  <eashoka> there is a simple solution!
2011-09-19T05:24:49  <mcstar> eashoka: well, greentea still had 1 ant
2011-09-19T05:25:04  <mcstar> and he would lose, but the turn limit was too low
2011-09-19T05:25:21  <eashoka> this could happen against any turn limit
2011-09-19T05:25:26  <mcstar> i know what that is: write a better bot
2011-09-19T05:25:55  <mleise> i tell you it is the player number. you have to play defensively with so many opponents
2011-09-19T05:26:46  <eashoka> we simply have to award a bonus for the winner (one who is having the largest army in the end) while encouraging doing battles
2011-09-19T05:26:54  <mcstar> eashoka: i have a feeling that theres a model when the increasing turn limit decreses the probability of having 1 ant justbefore theend and winning with it
2011-09-19T05:27:03  <eashoka> mleise : yea, defence is important too
2011-09-19T05:27:27  <mcstar> eashoka: then you would ignore the 2points per kill?
2011-09-19T05:27:43  <eashoka> that's why we should award some bonus to the one who remains in the end with the larger army
2011-09-19T05:27:45  <mcstar> just looking at the ant count is not representative
2011-09-19T05:27:52  <eashoka> here's my suggestion :
2011-09-19T05:28:14  <mcstar> mine is: integrate the ant-count curve
2011-09-19T05:28:31  <eashoka> 1) DON'T GIVE points for spawning. one has to spawn to get going. no need to give bonuses for that
2011-09-19T05:28:39  <mcstar> the biggest means better bot, more activity, + factor in the kills
2011-09-19T05:28:49  <eashoka> 2) +2 for a kill (to keep them interested in doing battles)
2011-09-19T05:28:56  <mcstar> thats a constant
2011-09-19T05:29:32  <eashoka> 3) -1 for a lost ant in battle. (this will test the defensive skills and also help reduce kamikaze instances)
2011-09-19T05:29:52  <mleise> still, if you lose ants during battle early on, you have a hard time recovering
2011-09-19T05:29:56  <eashoka> 4) then in the end add remaining ant count to ur total score. do that for all.
2011-09-19T05:30:55  <mleise> eashoka: hmm, so kamikaze will make your score go down, right?
2011-09-19T05:31:11  <mcstar> you know, i think the opposite way
2011-09-19T05:31:13  <mleise> because other bots have more remaining ants
2011-09-19T05:31:22  <eashoka> otherwise I could just amass a large army without doing much battles and then towards end just try to exchange it wholesale. that's really not that difficult compare to doing skillful battles and killing more enemy, that's where the real value is
2011-09-19T05:31:51  <eashoka> mleise : yes, ur score goes up when u do smart battles. killing without getting killed.
2011-09-19T05:32:15  <eashoka> mleise : isn't that's what we try to promote ?
2011-09-19T05:32:41  <eashoka> *should* be trying to promote
2011-09-19T05:32:45  <mleise> eashoka: yes, yes, I just cannot convince myself this will *ever* work in an n-player game
2011-09-19T05:34:02  <mleise> haha, with your scoring people can get negative scores :p
2011-09-19T05:34:14  <eashoka> mleise : yea
2011-09-19T05:34:35  <mleise> the big disgrace, the uber fail
2011-09-19T05:34:47  <eashoka> if one is loosing twice the many ants than killing and end up going extinct, that would happen
2011-09-19T05:35:09  <eashoka> they would deserve a - point in that case wouldn't they ? :-)
2011-09-19T05:35:22  <mleise> they would, i like the idea
2011-09-19T05:36:04  <mleise> it could be very motivating to work on the bot in that case. because you know you can do better
2011-09-19T05:37:01  <mleise> the more smaller goals there are to achieve the better
2011-09-19T05:37:08  <eashoka> eashoka : my only worry is, what if someone totally trying to avoid battles and try to just remain with the larger army ? I hope that will not be possible unless ur really good at defence and gathering both.
2011-09-19T05:37:47  <mcstar> lets see what i have to say: lets score offence and defence separately, there will be a low norm first, after that, the best bot will provide the standard, other will be normed by it, you can average the two scores to gether to get a global score, like this: s1*w+s2*(1-w), then, we can chooose a w constant to appropriately promote battle, the best w would stabilize the upper rankings
2011-09-19T05:39:56  <mcstar> ps. i wouldnt give points for ants that remains or such, just to keep thinhs simple
2011-09-19T05:40:03  <mcstar> -s
2011-09-19T05:40:24  <mleise> ants that remain is a simple score bonus :)
2011-09-19T05:40:33  <eashoka> mcstar : scoring has to be a very simple formula I think. explain in simple terms please. :-)
2011-09-19T05:40:35  <mcstar> yeah, im against it
2011-09-19T05:40:49  <mcstar> eashoka: simpler than what? i cant
2011-09-19T05:40:55  <mleise> i can!
2011-09-19T05:41:22  <mleise> score = defense_score * defense_weight + offense_score * offense_weight
2011-09-19T05:41:34  <mcstar> no
2011-09-19T05:41:37  <mleise> yes
2011-09-19T05:41:41  <mcstar> the weights are interconnected
2011-09-19T05:41:46  <mleise> no need to
2011-09-19T05:41:48  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-19T05:41:50  <mleise> no
2011-09-19T05:41:56  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-19T05:41:59  <mleise> why
2011-09-19T05:42:01  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-19T05:42:08  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2011-09-19T05:42:09  <eashoka> eashoka : I like the spirit of that formula
2011-09-19T05:42:19  <mcstar> we want a good balance between battle and defence
2011-09-19T05:42:29  <mcstar> if one weight goes up, the other must come down
2011-09-19T05:42:31  <eashoka> mcstar, mleeise : we can figure out details surrounding the weights later
2011-09-19T05:42:42  <mcstar> lol
2011-09-19T05:42:45  <eashoka> but that's a good agreeable start I think
2011-09-19T05:42:53  <mcstar> mcstar: mcstar i will address myself
2011-09-19T05:43:08  <eashoka> heh her
2011-09-19T05:43:21  <eashoka> damn! i'm having a key board nightmare today....
2011-09-19T05:43:32  <mcstar> when do you not?
2011-09-19T05:43:37  <mcstar> is it broken,
2011-09-19T05:43:40  <mcstar> ?
2011-09-19T05:43:49  <mcstar> i mean im making a lot of typos, but you top me
2011-09-19T05:43:59  <mleise> my mouse cable is broken, but we go off-topic :)
2011-09-19T05:44:09  <mcstar> sure
2011-09-19T05:44:17  <mcstar> i broke my mouse notlong ago
2011-09-19T05:44:22  <mcstar> literally
2011-09-19T05:44:40  <eashoka> so.. how would u calculate the defence_score for instance ?
2011-09-19T05:44:56  <mcstar> at least i wont be playing anymore not even my 1 time per month portion
2011-09-19T05:45:21  <mcstar> that is essentially the spawnrate-suicide
2011-09-19T05:46:19  <mcstar> and the offence score is obviously killed ants minus losses from my side
2011-09-19T05:46:35  <mcstar> yeah, not obviously
2011-09-19T05:46:50  <mcstar> it can be ergued that simply killed ants should be used
2011-09-19T05:46:53  <mcstar> argued*
2011-09-19T05:47:46  <eashoka> think it's better to get McLeopold and/or janzert involved in this as well, shall I go on and log a defect / feature request for this ? then we can think deep and put our elaborated thoughts there, all in one place. so that others can shoot them down easily and quickly :-)
2011-09-19T05:47:55  <mcstar> but tbh i have the perfect argument against not having this discussion
2011-09-19T05:48:03  <mcstar> whatever will be the BEST bot will win
2011-09-19T05:48:17  <mcstar> (by definition)so im alright with anything
2011-09-19T05:48:38  <mleise> hehe, but we want to have an interesting match until it wins, no?
2011-09-19T05:48:41  <mcstar> eashoka: i dont think theres any point doing so
2011-09-19T05:48:47  <mcstar> mleise: no
2011-09-19T05:49:00  <mcstar> ah yeah
2011-09-19T05:49:04  <mcstar> youre the visualizer guy
2011-09-19T05:49:08  <mcstar> you want interesting graphics
2011-09-19T05:49:09  <mleise> mcstar: ... yes ...
2011-09-19T05:49:17  <mcstar> :D
2011-09-19T05:49:41  <mleise> next contest will be in 3D ;)
2011-09-19T05:49:45  <mcstar> lol
2011-09-19T05:49:53  <mcstar> even harder to analyze the game right?
2011-09-19T05:50:09  <mcstar> take a look at the aitoolbox
2011-09-19T05:50:11  <mcstar> no

2011-09-19T05:51:23  <eashoka> I think it's worth given a try (slightly better scoring system that is) and see it in action, then all can decide. hope changing the bonus calc code is a fairly simple one.
2011-09-19T05:51:24  <mcstar> eashoka: i think its too late for such a change
2011-09-19T05:51:45  <mcstar> you could have argued more about this in beta
2011-09-19T05:51:50  <eashoka> mcstar : that could very well be true
2011-09-19T05:52:19  <mcstar> actually, i dont have a say in all this, so the GUYS may change this, surely you should talk to them
2011-09-19T05:52:27  <mcstar> its only my oppinion that it wont change

2011-09-19T06:04:11  <mcstar> ok, tell me what is the most heavily engineered plant?
2011-09-19T06:04:35  <mleise> Had an argument with someone in the ministry of agriculture, and took part in some action on a nuclear power plant
2011-09-19T06:04:35  <mcstar> and lets say, what country has the most of it
2011-09-19T06:04:54  <mleise> soy beans is the most spread one
2011-09-19T06:05:21  <mleise> And although I am not up to date, I would say brasil, probably
2011-09-19T06:05:36  <mleise> USA and Canada have a lot
2011-09-19T06:06:08  <mcstar> alright i believe you
2011-09-19T06:06:50  <mleise> Monsanto, Du Pont, Pioneer, BASF are some company names.
2011-09-19T06:07:24  <mcstar> „Guckt man genauer hin, wird die Lobbyarbeit für die Gentechnikkonzerne (Monsanto, BASF etc.) deutlich.
2011-09-19T06:07:55  <mleise> haha what was the search query?
2011-09-19T06:08:08  <mcstar> this
2011-09-19T06:08:11  <mcstar> and google found it

2011-09-19T06:10:06  <mcstar> but excuse me, i want to see some GP bashing
2011-09-19T06:10:23  <mleise> No, but it will make you look a Greenpeace with other eyes now that you know a member ;)

2011-09-19T06:12:19  <mleise> Yeah, I heard that before
2011-09-19T06:13:21  <mleise> But when the news show how easy it is to climb onto a nuclear power plant, I see someone else in that position :)
2011-09-19T06:14:28  <mcstar> they would never reach the plant
2011-09-19T06:14:46  <mcstar> thats a cooling tower i think what you refer to
2011-09-19T06:14:50  <mcstar> maybe im wrong
2011-09-19T06:15:22  <mleise> What I think is really great - unlreated to other things - is the independency from money from industry and politics. It is all financed by donations
2011-09-19T06:16:01  <mleise> mcstar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_s2P7W7B78 :)
2011-09-19T06:16:22  <mcstar> well, i dont think a bunch of kids should change the oppinions of the public
2011-09-19T06:17:32  <mcstar> i hope someday i will stop spelling oppinion with 2 p's
2011-09-19T06:17:46  <mleise> The 'kids' (there are people in the 50s as well) are talking with knowledgeable people in the main subsidiaries in each country.

2011-09-19T06:19:58  <mcstar> i dont find the right translation
2011-09-19T06:20:08  <mleise> super-cool? ^^
2011-09-19T06:20:08  <mcstar> its a bit more profane than super-cool
2011-09-19T06:20:41  <mcstar> but it is not an informal talk, you know
2011-09-19T06:20:48  <mcstar> and the guy is 40+ years old
2011-09-19T06:21:01  <mcstar> ok

2011-09-19T06:23:23  <mcstar> "tök más"
2011-09-19T06:24:02  <mcstar> means totally different in a similar childish, a bit profane way
2011-09-19T06:25:38  <mcstar> yeah, well, i have quite some remarks
2011-09-19T06:25:48  <mcstar> but i dontthink anyone is interested in them
2011-09-19T06:26:23  <mcstar> but they shouldnt put a monkey in a suite to talk to respected prof.
2011-09-19T06:26:49  <mleise> What is the prof respected for?
2011-09-19T06:27:22  <mcstar> basically, the hungarians reactors are very much related to him
2011-09-19T06:27:31  <mcstar> the controls the one on the campus
2011-09-19T06:27:52  <mcstar> and usually has a say in the matters of our nation's main reactor
2011-09-19T06:28:00  <mleise> Paks?
2011-09-19T06:28:02  <mcstar> and he teaches + the head of departments
2011-09-19T06:28:05  <mcstar> yep
2011-09-19T06:28:26  <mleise> So he is an advisor in this topic to the government
2011-09-19T06:28:35  <mcstar> and i personally had lectures from him, and he is quite alright
2011-09-19T06:28:40  <mcstar> yes
2011-09-19T06:28:46  <mcstar> he advised on fukushima too
2011-09-19T06:28:48  <mleise> I understand.
2011-09-19T06:28:50  <mcstar> had a report
2011-09-19T06:29:04  <mcstar> i think it must be available in enlgish
2011-09-19T06:29:38  <mcstar> i havent looked at it for a long time, maybe he has a closure on that matter
2011-09-19T06:31:39  <mleise> Maybe that prof knows where to put all the nuclear waste  ;) ?

2011-09-19T06:37:16  <mcstar> you better ask me condensed matter stuff or statistical physics
2011-09-19T06:37:21  <mleise> Neither did I. I'm mostly reading it up on Wikipedia

2011-09-19T16:17:01  <janzert> fine so far :)
2011-09-19T16:17:29  <janzert> It has only increased the length to this point of course
2011-09-19T16:18:18  <janzert> one thing to remember when looking at the percentages in it is that they don't include any cutoff games
2011-09-19T16:18:55  <McLeopold> ?
2011-09-19T16:18:59  <janzert> so at the current settings it is going for a turn limit of between 1 in 10 and 1 in 20 games that don't get cutoff

2011-09-19T16:19:40  <janzert> the percentage that hit the turn limit once you include cutoff games will be lower
2011-09-19T16:19:43  <McLeopold> ok, did you read my idea about the reduction being based on turns, not games?
2011-09-19T16:19:56  <janzert> yes, but I'm not sure what you mean
2011-09-19T16:20:44  <janzert> you mean based on the current turn limit?
2011-09-19T16:20:50  <McLeopold> well, no

2011-09-19T16:21:31  <McLeopold> out of 100 games, if you decide to lower the cutoff, 7-8 of those games would be cutoff if played again
2011-09-19T16:21:51  <McLeopold> that feels like too much
2011-09-19T16:22:16  <janzert> that's 1 in 13 approximately
2011-09-19T16:22:17  <McLeopold> the whole idea of doing a lower cutoff is to save time on the servers, no?
2011-09-19T16:23:08  <janzert> I suppose 1 in 15 would probably make a little more sense
2011-09-19T16:23:29  <janzert> given the current low and high marks
2011-09-19T16:24:00  <McLeopold> well, to save time on the server, what we really want to prevent is really long games, or turns.  Cutting off a game that would have gone about 210 down to 200 turns is not really saving much.
2011-09-19T16:24:05  <janzert> and right the reason for the cutoff is to end games that are going nowhere fast :P
2011-09-19T16:24:58  <McLeopold> so out of 100 games, if there were a sum of (700,000) turns that processed for all those games, we should cut off the top 7.5% of turns, not games
2011-09-19T16:25:05  <janzert> and once you've gotten to X turns why do we suppose it will end in X+10 turns?
2011-09-19T16:26:16  <McLeopold> It's not that I suppose it would only go 10 more turns, it just that we aren't saving much processing time and causing an unsatisfactory ending
2011-09-19T16:26:49  <janzert> the idea is that the cutoff is a reasonable length for the given map such that most games are ending within it
2011-09-19T16:27:10  <McLeopold> okay, I need to draw a picture...
2011-09-19T16:27:23  <janzert> you 700,000 turns are just the number of turns for the cutoff those games were played at of course
2011-09-19T16:27:26  <McLeopold> I don't think we are far off, I just think my idea has merit
2011-09-19T16:27:42  <janzert> maybe 700,000 turns wasn't enough if 50% of the games were ending at the turn limit
2011-09-19T16:29:54  <janzert> I can see where the acceptable percentage of games ending at the turn limit is debatable
2011-09-19T16:32:18  <McLeopold> let's say that 99% of games would end in 300 turns for a map, but 1% would take 1500 turns, wouldn't we want to cut just above 300?
2011-09-19T16:33:08  <janzert> if we saw games with that distribution yes
2011-09-19T16:33:24  <janzert> I've been assuming something closer to a normal distribution
2011-09-19T16:33:25  <McLeopold> so we can graph the distribution of turn limits
2011-09-19T16:34:02  <janzert> we can graph the distribution of turns taken for naturally ending games up to the current turn limit yes
2011-09-19T16:34:03  <McLeopold> I guess I'm saying, don't assume normal, so use the area of the graph
2011-09-19T16:35:19  <McLeopold> out of your 100 turn sample, find the line that would cut 7.5% of turns, rather than 7.5% of games
2011-09-19T16:35:21  <janzert> well the current system would dance around 300 turns for the turn limit
2011-09-19T16:35:46  <McLeopold> I'm assuming we would start high and move down
2011-09-19T16:36:03  <janzert> it's always working from the current limit
2011-09-19T16:36:25  <McLeopold> yeah, but when we create new maps...
2011-09-19T16:39:48  <janzert> so given your last example where naturally 99% of games end at 300 and 1% at 1500
2011-09-19T16:40:46  <janzert> if the current cutoff is 500, I'm seeing only 1% of games hitting the cutoff how should I adjust the cutoff?
2011-09-19T16:41:01  <janzert> I don't know that those games would naturally end at 1500
2011-09-19T16:42:22  <McLeopold> but you know you can cut 1% of the games down by 200 turns
2011-09-19T16:42:51  <McLeopold> so, you may not be making more games git the cutoff, but you still save something
2011-09-19T16:43:33  <McLeopold> the savings isn't just 1 unit per game, it is number of turns saved
2011-09-19T16:44:05  <janzert> but the amount of savings I'm will to take is determined by how many games I'm will to have hit the limit
2011-09-19T16:44:17  <janzert> will->willing
2011-09-19T16:44:56  <cody__> do larger maps mean higher cut off time?... souldint it be propotional?
2011-09-19T16:45:00  <McLeopold> yeah, and I think it should be number of turns prevented from processing, not number of games that will end abruptly
2011-09-19T16:46:34  <McLeopold> I understand your point about needing to know when to reduce.
2011-09-19T16:46:47  <janzert> for any given turn limit the upside is that games that would have gone longer we don't have to use the resources to run those turns, the downside is that we may have inaccurate results for that game

2011-09-19T16:47:10  <janzert> so the point of decision in the compromise for me is the percentage of games hitting the cutoff

2011-09-19T16:49:18  <janzert> so long as 1500 isn't overtaxing the whole system of course (that's where we have to have a hard upper limit)

2011-09-19T16:49:56  <McLeopold> when I reset skils, do you want to reset the last time you adjusted maps?
2011-09-19T16:50:03  <janzert> anyway once I see where the current method hits equilibrium I may of course completely change my mind ;)
2011-09-19T16:50:07  <McLeopold> start the 100 map count over?

2011-09-19T17:05:23  <janzert> btw, I think the comment about how it picks a seed is slightly off
2011-09-19T17:05:35  <janzert> at least if it's not I think the code should change
2011-09-19T17:05:38  <McLeopold> I might not have updated that comment :)

2011-09-19T17:06:22  <McLeopold> what line?
2011-09-19T17:06:23  <janzert> the comment says that it chooses the player least recently used as a seed, but I think it is (and should be) simple the player least recently played
2011-09-19T17:07:06  <McLeopold> least recently used player (in any game) -> for the new seed
2011-09-19T17:07:11  <McLeopold> I could write that better

2011-09-19T17:12:12  <McLeopold> I feel our map generation stuff is lacking
2011-09-19T17:12:27  <janzert> although since it requires 100 games per map between updates it won't hurt anything to run it more frequently

2011-09-19T17:13:28  <janzert> besides adding batches of maps we should maybe think about some sort of metric for removing maps that don't play well

2011-09-19T17:16:05  <McLeopold> maps that produce surprising results?
2011-09-19T17:16:20  <janzert> would be good or bad? ;)

2011-09-19T17:17:08  <McLeopold> well, it may reinforce dominant strategies, but is probably still the best way to detect noisy maps or results

2011-09-19T19:29:19  <cichociemno> mleise: I just read log of channel. I know how bot is tested on server. I read a code, and try it with with test_bot.sh. But still, it works completly ok on my local, but has problems on server.
2011-09-19T19:30:37  <cichociemno> To read/write i'm using the code from example and previously I have no problems. I will try to upload some old stuff and see if there is a difference.
