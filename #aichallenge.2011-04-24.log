2011-04-24T00:00:26  <j3camero> McLeopold: that's the right idea. On the landing page it suffices to say something like "you have ants that fight other ants".
2011-04-24T00:00:30  <antimatroid> amstan: what do you want me to do about LaTeX on the specs page?
2011-04-24T00:00:33  <antimatroid> should i do my best without it?
2011-04-24T00:00:39  <amstan> antimatroid: idk
2011-04-24T00:00:43  <amstan> antimatroid: what about it?
2011-04-24T00:00:50  <antimatroid> it isn't rendering it when you convert
2011-04-24T00:00:56  <antimatroid> look at the distance section on the specs page
2011-04-24T00:01:10  <j3camero> antimatroid: PDF?
2011-04-24T00:01:33  <antimatroid> j3camero: you can embed some LaTeX (they don't have all the packages i would like) into github wikis

2011-04-24T00:02:27  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan wwwdesign * re8bc5b1 / (9 files in 4 dirs): added favicon, added menu - http://bit.ly/h1Amna
2011-04-24T00:02:55  <computerwiz_222> maybe i've gone too simple..
2011-04-24T00:05:18  <computerwiz_222> also, i created that ant on the new website design in inkscape. the svg file should be in the repo (afaik, amstan added it)
2011-04-24T00:05:30  <computerwiz_222> we can do whatever with it, large versions could be fun
2011-04-24T00:05:41  <McLeopold> computerwiz_222: to generic, more like mine, it needs to be "salesy"
2011-04-24T00:06:22  <antimatroid> "Ants is a multi-player strategy game where colonies of ants fight for domination and you get to control one of the colonies. You participate by writing a computer program in a language of your choice that inputs data about the current game state and outputs which moves it would like to make.

2011-04-24T00:06:26  <antimatroid> with a sample game below it

2011-04-24T00:06:51  <antimatroid> even though it's my only language
2011-04-24T00:07:25  <amstan> oh man..
2011-04-24T00:07:27  <amstan> git merge

2011-04-24T00:07:33  <amstan> it did all the magic

2011-04-24T00:07:39  <computerwiz_222> nicely done antimatroid
2011-04-24T00:07:50  <amstan> computerwiz_222: http://hypertriangle.com:13080/quickstart.php
2011-04-24T00:07:54  <computerwiz_222> i just removed something that i felt was out of place.. idk why
2011-04-24T00:07:54  <j3camero> The Google AI Challenge is all about creating artificial intelligence, whether you are a complete beginner or an expert. Using the easy-to-use starter kit, you will create a computer program that controls a simulated colony of ants. Submit your program online to watch your ant colony fight for domination against colonies created by other people from around the world. It only takes 5 minutes to get started.
2011-04-24T00:08:21  <computerwiz_222> amstan: would you look at this... this new design is working well
2011-04-24T00:08:23  <antimatroid> computerwiz_222: can you try playing around with a "dirt" coloured background where white is?
2011-04-24T00:08:38  <antimatroid> i like the design, but do feel a few of mcleopolds sentiments from yesterday
2011-04-24T00:08:45  <antimatroid> the blue still doesn't feel quite right
2011-04-24T00:08:56  <amstan> antimatroid: he tried white, it didn't look as cool
2011-04-24T00:08:57  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: i tried a few things... from an accessabiltiy point, i don't want to make it difficult to read the content text
2011-04-24T00:09:06  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-24T00:09:13  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: to be honest, it depends vastly on the monitor
2011-04-24T00:09:17  <computerwiz_222> at work, it looks like ass
2011-04-24T00:09:23  <computerwiz_222> (well.. the old version)
2011-04-24T00:09:30  <computerwiz_222> i adjusted the blue
2011-04-24T00:09:39  <antimatroid> j3camero: i'm going to morph our two explanations
2011-04-24T00:09:41  <amstan> computerwiz_222: give me the commit with the white, i'll send a link
2011-04-24T00:09:47  <computerwiz_222> um..
2011-04-24T00:09:51  <j3camero> antimatroid: yeah for sure. I was just drafting.
2011-04-24T00:09:59  <computerwiz_222> amstan: little help
2011-04-24T00:10:02  <amstan> computerwiz_222: git log
2011-04-24T00:10:17  <amstan> git checkout commitnumber to see it
2011-04-24T00:10:21  <amstan> git checkout master when done
2011-04-24T00:11:52  <McLeopold> computerwiz_222: can the phrase "Planet Wars" easily be put in place of "Ants" and still look good?  I'm think of if the next contest has a longer name.
2011-04-24T00:12:03  <computerwiz_222> http://home.hypertriangle.com/~andrew/aicontest/
2011-04-24T00:12:06  <j3camero> antimatroid: in general I think we have to be careful to distinguish between "sales" materials and "reference" materials on the website. Most of the page hits will be on the sales materials. With the sales sections, the objective is purely to drive the traffic and convert them to the next stage. It's even okay to lie a little, like reassuring people that it will be really easy.
2011-04-24T00:12:31  <computerwiz_222> McLeopold: I'm sure that something can be arranged. Possibly reduce the size of the font, have 2 lines and maybe offset them.
2011-04-24T00:12:42  <computerwiz_222> McLeopold: It's not a deal breaker, that's for sure.
2011-04-24T00:12:51  <McLeopold> Okay, here comes some nitpicking...
2011-04-24T00:13:23  <McLeopold> Can you make the "Sign Up" larger than the "Sign In"?  Regestered users will already know where to look.
2011-04-24T00:13:42  <computerwiz_222> we could.. it might look funny though
2011-04-24T00:13:48  <amstan> it will yes
2011-04-24T00:13:49  <McLeopold> I think brown would be a better background
2011-04-24T00:13:53  <computerwiz_222> Medium Text: Small Text | Large Text
2011-04-24T00:14:12  <antimatroid> j3camero: i like the part where you explicitly add "will" to "you will"
2011-04-24T00:14:15  <antimatroid> :p
2011-04-24T00:15:54  <j3camero> antimatroid: totally. That first paragraph has to reassure people that they really can do it. People have to be able to see themselves creating AI. Basically, you've got ten seconds to convince a person that they really can make AI, even though they are sure they cannot.
2011-04-24T00:16:14  <amstan> antimatroid: j3camero: when you guys are done tell me when, i can update the test server with the text
2011-04-24T00:16:48  <McLeopold> amstan: would you consider an upvote/downvote mod for the forums?
2011-04-24T00:16:55  <antimatroid> "The Google AI Challenge is all about creating artificial intelligence, whether you are a complete beginner or an expert. Using one of the easy-to-use starter kits, you will create a computer program in a language of your choice that controls a simulated colony of ants which fights among other colonies for domination."
2011-04-24T00:17:14  <amstan> McLeopold: if you can find me a mod that does it, and that doesn't take ages to install(manually editing files), then sure
2011-04-24T00:17:20  <antimatroid> i really want to point out the fact that they're just having to read data from input, go to town deciding which moves to make, then output those moves
2011-04-24T00:17:23  <amstan> McLeopold: but yes.. i agree, the reddit way is the best
2011-04-24T00:17:42  <antimatroid> can we use reddit for our forums?
2011-04-24T00:17:48  <antimatroid> it's all open source yeah?
2011-04-24T00:17:51  <amstan> yes
2011-04-24T00:17:53  <antimatroid> is it easily used for other forums
2011-04-24T00:17:55  <antimatroid> that would be cool
2011-04-24T00:18:08  <amstan> anyone know french? is this spam? http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1371
2011-04-24T00:18:18  <antimatroid> or we could just make an aichallenge subreddit? :P
2011-04-24T00:18:35  <amstan> antimatroid: and post what in it?
2011-04-24T00:18:44  <j3camero> lol wtf yes its spam
2011-04-24T00:18:45  <computerwiz_222> amstan: he lives in vancouver with a few kids
2011-04-24T00:18:50  <computerwiz_222> our site is cool apparently
2011-04-24T00:18:51  <antimatroid> i guess forums really want sections
2011-04-24T00:18:56  <McLeopold> amstan: that is spam
2011-04-24T00:18:56  <antimatroid> which is what subreddits are
2011-04-24T00:18:58  <amstan> computerwiz_222: orly?
2011-04-24T00:19:03  <computerwiz_222> computerwiz_222: it's spam lol
2011-04-24T00:19:03  <antimatroid> i wish they would implement a tree structure for subreddits
2011-04-24T00:19:07  <computerwiz_222> amstan: *
2011-04-24T00:19:31  <amstan> ok, now it's gone
2011-04-24T00:19:48  <McLeopold> j3camero: do you think we can attempt i18n?
2011-04-24T00:20:05  <amstan> McLeopold: when we get django yes
2011-04-24T00:20:13  <amstan> McLeopold: till then, god no, not with php
2011-04-24T00:20:13  <j3camero> McLeopold: I think we could yes, but only by using Django.
2011-04-24T00:20:36  <McLeopold> we would need a team of translators
2011-04-24T00:21:02  <j3camero> We could use Django this time around, if we have somebody who already is pretty decent at it. Barring that, I think we should kick the i18n and l10n stuff one more contest down the road.
2011-04-24T00:21:03  <McLeopold> I doesn't hurt to start now, and maybe make one page language specific, just as a test to see if people are willing
2011-04-24T00:21:42  <McLeopold> maybe the 5-minute-starter could be special?
2011-04-24T00:21:50  <McLeopold> and help with conversion rates
2011-04-24T00:22:26  <j3camero> We could offer translations of the most popular pages on a case by case basis. That would be really easy.
2011-04-24T00:22:35  <j3camero> As for full i18n, I think probably not.
2011-04-24T00:22:52  <McLeopold> Let's try with the 5-min-starter only, just to see if we can get commited translators
2011-04-24T00:23:21  * amstan doesn't want to see the urls for those pages
2011-04-24T00:23:36  <McLeopold> use HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
2011-04-24T00:23:55  <antimatroid> h'okay people, criticise this
2011-04-24T00:23:56  <antimatroid> "The Google AI Challenge is all about creating artificial intelligence, whether you are a complete beginner or an expert.

From there check out the tutorials on how to locally run your bot and begin programming!"
2011-04-24T00:24:06  <j3camero> How about this: created a subdirectory fr/ in the website. In there we will do our best to expand a french translation of the most high traffic pages. Anything that isn't translated yet just gets linked out to the english version.
2011-04-24T00:24:23  <McLeopold> http://ietherpad.com/dmVS6JTTSp
2011-04-24T00:25:10  <antimatroid> there we go
2011-04-24T00:25:19  <antimatroid> start hacking at it for me :P
2011-04-24T00:25:29  <j3camero> I say french because I believe we have several french speakers inn here, including myself. And I am guessing computerwiz_222 as well, just based on his name (Rossignol)
2011-04-24T00:25:59  <antimatroid> stocha is from france
2011-04-24T00:26:18  <j3camero> But we can also start expanding other translations as well. Particularly, we want to do Polish, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish. Google Anlytics will tell us which languages are most important.
2011-04-24T00:26:42  <McLeopold> j3camero: maintaining translation strings is best practice, not separate sets of web pages
2011-04-24T00:26:56  <antimatroid> lol, i was going to say google should let websites provide their own versions translted
2011-04-24T00:27:01  <antimatroid> then realised how bad that would be
2011-04-24T00:27:11  <computerwiz_222> j3camero: i'm not a french speaker, but i can read/understand enough to get by
2011-04-24T00:27:32  <j3camero> McLeopold: yes, for sure. I am just trying to bootstrap what we have now, avoiding building any machinery to deal with translation strings and _() and that sort of thing.
2011-04-24T00:28:28  <j3camero> A partial french translation is something we can build out in a few minutes or hours with no programming required.
2011-04-24T00:28:44  <computerwiz_222> i like those cute little flags
2011-04-24T00:28:51  <computerwiz_222> we can use those on our site to select language
2011-04-24T00:28:51  <McLeopold> j3camero: I'm willing to put minimal hooks in 1 php page.
2011-04-24T00:28:54  <antimatroid> i want to know where asian programmers hang out
2011-04-24T00:29:00  <McLeopold> asia?
2011-04-24T00:29:04  <computerwiz_222> lol
2011-04-24T00:29:05  <antimatroid> online
2011-04-24T00:29:33  <McLeopold> j3camero: join the fun http://ietherpad.com/dmVS6JTTSp
2011-04-24T00:29:37  <antimatroid> there are meant to be lots of really smart asians (meh screw pc, it's the stereotype) yet not so many for these contests, i want to attract them
2011-04-24T00:29:46  <j3camero> Yeah I really really want to tap China and India. I know there are huge communities out there, but we haven't broken into them so far. Russia, yes. Poland, yes. Germany, yes. But zilch from China and India.
2011-04-24T00:29:53  <antimatroid> and korea
2011-04-24T00:30:07  <antimatroid> and japan (although they might be a bit busy atm)
2011-04-24T00:30:17  <antimatroid> i will give the subreddits a go when we launch
2011-04-24T00:30:19  <McLeopold> we had a south korean fight me for the top spot last year
2011-04-24T00:30:23  <antimatroid> but other than that i don't really know where to look
2011-04-24T00:30:35  <antimatroid> yeah, but that was a single person
2011-04-24T00:30:37  <antimatroid> i remember them
2011-04-24T00:30:43  <McLeopold> kcm1700
2011-04-24T00:30:44  <antimatroid> we had oldman from china too
2011-04-24T00:30:49  <computerwiz_222> we should rent a van and go cross country :
2011-04-24T00:30:55  <McLeopold> didn't know he was from china
2011-04-24T00:30:58  <computerwiz_222> :P
2011-04-24T00:31:01  <antimatroid> good luck picking me up
2011-04-24T00:31:06  <j3camero> It seems we have only broken into countries whhere there are a decent number of people who also speak english. That's not surprising, since we have been english-only up until now.
2011-04-24T00:31:11  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * raef56d7 / website/css/typo.css : fixed header position - http://bit.ly/h40U7s
2011-04-24T00:31:19  <antimatroid> j3camero: we've tapped reddits market :P
2011-04-24T00:31:26  <j3camero> Pretty much  yeah.
2011-04-24T00:31:57  <j3camero> lol we are driving across australia in a van, showing the contest to ALL THE PEOPLE. *cricket* *cricket*
2011-04-24T00:32:00  <computerwiz_222> what about contacting univesities directly and sending them promotional stuff like posters
2011-04-24T00:32:04  <j3camero> Are there crickets in the desert?
2011-04-24T00:32:07  <computerwiz_222> like.. csc's at other schools
2011-04-24T00:32:21  <antimatroid> j3camero; i'm on the island off the bottom, you'll need to get another boat ride from the mainland :P
2011-04-24T00:32:23  <amstan> computerwiz_222: problem is getting people to do it
2011-04-24T00:32:30  <amstan> computerwiz_222: we did this in the past
2011-04-24T00:32:59  <computerwiz_222> i know.. i mentioned it at McMaster last year and a couple friends of mine made accounts
2011-04-24T00:33:06  <computerwiz_222> they didn't do anything.. but they still found out about it
2011-04-24T00:33:12  <j3camero> computerwiz_222: I did a lot of that during Tron. Google as a whole was pumping it hard at many campuses. We got some limited success, but nothing ultra-successful. We got like a dozen here and five there. Nothing like the way it catches fire in internet communities (forums, reddit, etc).
2011-04-24T00:33:36  <computerwiz_222> j3camero: i half-expected that, worth a shot i guess
2011-04-24T00:33:50  <amstan> j3camero: i was in #proggit a few times, the mere mention of the contest spurred a few people's interest
2011-04-24T00:34:07  <j3camero> I really really did it too. I had a team of people liasing with reps at some 200 universities around the world.
2011-04-24T00:34:13  <computerwiz_222> j3camero: if our sponsors will pay for some nice magnets i'll put them on my car
2011-04-24T00:34:23  <computerwiz_222> 2010 Kia Forte, not making the contest look too bad :P
2011-04-24T00:34:38  <j3camero> Awww yeah
2011-04-24T00:35:09  <amstan> antimatroid: do we have an "using the tools" wiki page?
2011-04-24T00:35:50  <antimatroid> amstan: no
2011-04-24T00:35:54  <j3camero> Okay, it is time for me to sleep.
2011-04-24T00:36:00  <antimatroid> i have been waiting for people to decide on how we are to use them :P
2011-04-24T00:36:04  <amstan> antimatroid: it still says planet wars in a few places on it
2011-04-24T00:36:11  <computerwiz_222> j3camero: Same for me.
2011-04-24T00:36:12  <amstan> oh, ok, lol
2011-04-24T00:36:14  <j3camero> I am pumped about this website design. We are going to look less sketchy than we ever have before.
2011-04-24T00:36:19  <computerwiz_222> Night everyone
2011-04-24T00:36:27  <amstan> computerwiz_222: cya
2011-04-24T00:36:29  <antimatroid> the last design wasn't sketchy
2011-04-24T00:36:30  <computerwiz_222> j3camero: awesome
2011-04-24T00:36:40  <antimatroid> and it's 2 36pm you fools
2011-04-24T00:36:48  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: first thing i saw.. those vertical white lines on the header
2011-04-24T00:37:00  <amstan> antimatroid: except we're in not in australia
2011-04-24T00:37:06  <computerwiz_222> antimatroid: amstan showed me that removal of those lines actually makes it worse
2011-04-24T00:37:36  <j3camero> computerwiz_222 haha yes. I remember fiddling with those damn lines before the last launch. Grr.
2011-04-24T00:38:01  <computerwiz_222> j3camero: Bye for now, I'll be online tomorrow more than likely

2011-04-24T00:38:09  <amstan> j3camero: what did amreidle do?
2011-04-24T00:38:32  <antimatroid> amstan: another problem :P
2011-04-24T00:38:46  <antimatroid> the example map etc. fonts aren't whatever gives constant width for characters
2011-04-24T00:38:49  <antimatroid> which is a problem
2011-04-24T00:39:06  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, i should fix that
2011-04-24T00:39:10  <amstan> antimatroid: make an issue
2011-04-24T00:39:19  <antimatroid> i wouldn't have a clue how :P
2011-04-24T00:39:39  <amstan> antimatroid: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues
2011-04-24T00:39:44  <amstan> antimatroid: press New Issue
2011-04-24T00:40:00  <amstan> antimatroid: put a nice description, then assign it to me
2011-04-24T00:41:12  <antimatroid> done
2011-04-24T00:41:59  <amstan> antimatroid: only this page? http://hypertriangle.com:13080/specification.php
2011-04-24T00:42:36  <antimatroid> amstan: the old one was done in a wiki yeah?
2011-04-24T00:42:37  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/specification.php
2011-04-24T00:42:41  <antimatroid> they managed to get that out
2011-04-24T00:42:57  <antimatroid> including by the looks of it the latex stuff
2011-04-24T00:43:05  <amstan> idk, didn't you make that?
2011-04-24T00:43:23  <antimatroid> not for planet wars
2011-04-24T00:43:34  <antimatroid> janzert: was that you?
2011-04-24T00:43:45  <janzert> hmm?
2011-04-24T00:44:02  <janzert> oh, the old planetwars spec?
2011-04-24T00:44:12  <janzert> I think that was written by jmcarthur
2011-04-24T00:44:50  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: ping me sometime :P
2011-04-24T00:45:34  <amstan> antimatroid: you might want to use later tell
2011-04-24T00:45:54  <antimatroid> meh :P
2011-04-24T00:45:55  <amstan> antimatroid: also.. it was on the forums, that's where he first posted it
2011-04-24T00:46:43  <janzert> amstan: didn't he actually write in the google code wiki though?
2011-04-24T00:46:47  <janzert> I'm not really sure
2011-04-24T00:46:54  <amstan> maybe
2011-04-24T00:47:18  <amstan> the wiki from google code was transferred: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Planet-Wars-Game-Specification
2011-04-24T00:48:13  <amstan> antimatroid: check the svn logs
2011-04-24T00:48:31  <amstan> antimatroid: it seems like the one who transferred it over added the image
2011-04-24T00:48:46  <amstan> antimatroid: git log*, it should be in the history
2011-04-24T00:49:15  <antimatroid> from the looks of that page, maybe i should just go through and try a similar format
2011-04-24T00:49:43  <antimatroid> how quickly can you update your local copy to what is saved on the wiki?
2011-04-24T00:49:53  <amstan> antimatroid: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commits/pw/planet_wars/www/specification.php
2011-04-24T00:50:01  <amstan> antimatroid: i just git pull, then ./setup.py
2011-04-24T00:51:31  <amstan> antimatroid: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/d22dc9b6f7eddd7f6e7d12daa01e63e68151ab69
2011-04-24T00:51:32  <antimatroid> actually, the pages aren't exactly the same
2011-04-24T00:52:38  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: pong
2011-04-24T00:52:51  <amstan> antimatroid: i updated the test server with the new wiki contents
2011-04-24T00:52:51  <antimatroid> i don't think we need you now sorry :P
2011-04-24T00:52:58  <antimatroid> you didn't do the specs page for planet wars did you?
2011-04-24T00:53:04  <jmcarthur> yes i did
2011-04-24T00:53:14  <jmcarthur> i wrote it using markdown and pandoc
2011-04-24T00:53:25  <amstan> pandoc?
2011-04-24T00:53:25  <antimatroid> oh, so it wasn't just converted from a wiki?
2011-04-24T00:54:37  <antimatroid> amstan: I have a challenge for you :P embed frontiers visualiser onto that main page
2011-04-24T00:54:46  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, i have to work on that too
2011-04-24T00:55:41  <amstan> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/78
2011-04-24T01:03:56  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: no it wasn't just a conversion
2011-04-24T01:04:14  <antimatroid> bugger :P
2011-04-24T01:04:19  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i actually wrote the majority of both versions. i don't remember which was first, even
2011-04-24T01:04:29  *** needsch <needsch!~Robert@ip-81-210-159-12.unitymediagroup.de> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-04-24T01:04:37  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: if the wiki has a fairly common format then pandoc can probably read it
2011-04-24T01:04:48  <jmcarthur> markdown, textile, etc.
2011-04-24T01:05:03  <antimatroid> it's using whatever github wikis use :P
2011-04-24T01:05:08  <amstan> jmcarthur: what is this pandoc then?
2011-04-24T01:05:24  <jmcarthur> pandoc is markup sex
2011-04-24T01:05:38  <jmcarthur> all the markup languages getting together and having babies
2011-04-24T01:05:42  <amstan> jmcarthur: so can it do githubish markdown + latex from it into html?
2011-04-24T01:05:49  <jmcarthur> probably
2011-04-24T01:06:08  <jmcarthur> how does github markdown differ from vanilla markdown?
2011-04-24T01:06:19  <amstan> jmcarthur: i shall change this then to use pandoc: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/website/setup.py
2011-04-24T01:06:28  <amstan> jmcarthur: a few things, i'm not sure offhand
2011-04-24T01:06:30  <amstan> latex i guess
2011-04-24T01:06:41  <jmcarthur> pandoc supports latex in markdown
2011-04-24T01:07:13  <jmcarthur> it can even import and export latex :D

2011-04-24T01:36:29  <janzert> at least doesn't ring a bell at all
2011-04-24T01:38:04  <janzert> hmm, yeah looks like someone familiar with c headers wrote it

2011-04-24T01:41:47  <janzert> I also see session.php is currently included with "include 'session.php';" everywhere, which also seems like an error since a missing include will only cause a warning not an error
2011-04-24T01:42:16  <janzert> and require, better require_once, would be what we really want
2011-04-24T01:47:56  <McLeopold> janzert: all the includes on the php site are ridiculous. it all gets linked in through spagetti code
2011-04-24T01:48:37  <McLeopold> header -> session -> mysql_login -> server_info
2011-04-24T01:50:00  <McLeopold> I think at some point you'd want a web request to only connect to the sql server if it needs info from it, but that may be every request?
2011-04-24T01:50:13  <janzert> I think so
2011-04-24T01:50:53  <janzert> doesn't the session information get pulled from the db?
2011-04-24T01:51:52  <janzert> hmm, actually maybe it doesn't
2011-04-24T01:52:28  <janzert> it looks like the only part of session.php that touches the database is to activate a user
2011-04-24T01:52:35  <McLeopold> I'm looking at that now.  I should at least unhook the header.php from connecting to the database unless needed
2011-04-24T01:53:08  <janzert> the header does need the session though
2011-04-24T01:53:20  <McLeopold> session doesn't need mysql
2011-04-24T01:53:24  <janzert> right
2011-04-24T01:54:11  <janzert> at least if you refactor activate_user out of it
2011-04-24T01:54:30  <janzert> which it doesn't seem to really belong there anyway
2011-04-24T01:54:34  <McLeopold> I don't see an "active_user"?
2011-04-24T01:54:43  <janzert> activate
2011-04-24T01:54:52  <janzert> last function in the file
2011-04-24T01:55:03  <McLeopold> grant_permission_to_user
2011-04-24T01:55:32  <McLeopold> oh, I already factored that out, but didn't commit yet :)
2011-04-24T01:55:35  <janzert> hmm, at line 79 for me
2011-04-24T01:55:37  <janzert> ahh
2011-04-24T01:56:30  <janzert> I hope you're getting rid of all the /deprecated/ functions the just return false too?
2011-04-24T01:56:46  <McLeopold> it might be dangerous to put an include before the <!DOCTYPE, no?
2011-04-24T01:56:50  <McLeopold> yes, I am
2011-04-24T01:57:38  <McLeopold> ug, and header needs footer or you have open div tags :(
2011-04-24T01:58:05  <janzert> yes, fairly unavoidable with the way it is written
2011-04-24T01:58:30  <McLeopold> okay, stop me from doing too much, I've only started this to fix uploads :/

2011-04-24T01:59:35  <janzert> yeah, I wouldn't go too much further
2011-04-24T02:00:14  <janzert> or you're looking at a whole rewrite of the way the html is produced, (e.g. using a really template system such as smarty)
2011-04-24T02:00:26  <janzert> s/really/real
2011-04-24T02:17:28  <McLeopold> janzert: do you know php?
2011-04-24T02:17:45  <janzert> not really
2011-04-24T02:18:00  <McLeopold> hmm, do you think you could debug a scoping issue?
2011-04-24T02:18:19  <janzert> I can try and help at least ;)
2011-04-24T02:18:36  <McLeopold> okay, I've got check_submit.php, which includes submission.php
2011-04-24T02:19:04  <McLeopold> I'm using the function create_new_submission_for_current_user, which calls an sql insert statement.
2011-04-24T02:19:14  <McLeopold> I've put the sql statement into sql.php
2011-04-24T02:19:35  <McLeopold> mysql_query(sprintf($sql["insert_new_submission"],current_user_id()))
2011-04-24T02:19:51  <McLeopold> $sql is an associative array
2011-04-24T02:20:20  <McLeopold> I get a "Query was empty" error when I use the $sql variable, but if I just put the text in there, it works?
2011-04-24T02:21:14  <McLeopold> If, instead of calling cureate_new_submission_for_current_user, I just call the mysql_query directly from check_submit, the $sql variable works?
2011-04-24T02:21:35  <janzert> my first debug step with php would be to stick an 'echo sprintf($sql["insert_new_submission"]...' line just before the call
2011-04-24T02:22:13  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it is slightly harder to give people a vector of food information now :P
2011-04-24T02:22:29  * antimatroid is updating his starter bot
2011-04-24T02:22:31  <janzert> submission.php is including sql.php in some way? (require, etc.)
2011-04-24T02:23:12  <McLeopold> check_submit -> mysql_login -> sql
2011-04-24T02:23:26  <McLeopold> I've added directly to submission just for kicks
2011-04-24T02:29:48  <janzert> slightly different topic, but I wonder if it wouldn't be a good idea to add contest_query function in mysql_login that takes a query name and the associated arguments and does the mysql_query(sprintf($sql[$query_name], arguments... call
2011-04-24T02:34:09  <McLeopold> if we are doing that, then we could switch to prepared statements easily
2011-04-24T02:34:22  <McLeopold> also, my problem was I can't use a global in a function
2011-04-24T02:34:48  <McLeopold> I'm so use to scope chains
2011-04-24T02:34:52  <janzert> ahh
2011-04-24T02:35:11  <McLeopold> actually, that one gets me in python all the time
2011-04-24T02:35:15  <janzert> you need "global $sql"
2011-04-24T02:35:30  <McLeopold> yeah, so I might as well create the contest_query function
2011-04-24T02:37:34  <janzert> something like http://pastebin.com/QzgeeGuR
2011-04-24T02:37:40  <janzert> should do it
2011-04-24T02:38:01  <McLeopold> I can just include the sql.php right in that function
2011-04-24T02:38:05  <janzert> although completely untested and in particular unsure if it works for a query without additional parameters
2011-04-24T02:38:30  <janzert> yeah, if it's not needed anywhere else
2011-04-24T02:43:59  <McLeopold> janzert: http://pastebin.com/CisU4kvW
2011-04-24T02:44:04  <CIA-33> aichallenge: Nick Ham epsilon * r34a936c / (3 files): updated the c++ starter bot - http://bit.ly/eIZhtf
2011-04-24T02:44:21  <antimatroid> i think i might know what my problem with git ssh keys is
2011-04-24T02:44:31  <McLeopold> did you have a problem?
2011-04-24T02:44:38  <antimatroid> would having a dynamic ip and resetting it cause me issues?
2011-04-24T02:44:44  <McLeopold> it shouldn't
2011-04-24T02:45:11  <McLeopold> if you are on ubuntu, you should have a ".ssh" dir, and that should be good enough to authenticate
2011-04-24T02:45:15  <antimatroid> i used to find i always needed to add my email address to the end of my key on the website whenever i wanted to do something
2011-04-24T02:45:29  <antimatroid> but recently i got a new router and haven't been needing to reset it as much, anyway, something has changed
2011-04-24T02:45:36  <McLeopold> yeah, my public part ends in my email address
2011-04-24T02:46:04  <antimatroid> yeah, on the website it strips it, but i used to not be able to connect after x amount of time unless i manually readded that to the end
2011-04-24T02:46:09  <antimatroid> but it just worked without me having to do that
2011-04-24T02:46:30  <antimatroid> anyway, the c++ bot keeps track of food information now, and only gives people information about whether a square is visible or not
2011-04-24T02:46:59  <McLeopold> why did you say food is harder now?
2011-04-24T02:48:41  <antimatroid> it's hard to have say a vector<Location> food; in state
2011-04-24T02:48:53  <antimatroid> well, unless you do a full scan of the map to find current foo
2011-04-24T02:49:11  <antimatroid> if you just add locations with an 'f' line, you will add some food more than once
2011-04-24T02:49:31  <antimatroid> the best bet is to use a set
2011-04-24T02:49:59  <McLeopold> oh, yeah, I looked at that in my code and decided to solve it later :)
2011-04-24T02:50:10  <antimatroid> i just got rid of the food and enemies vector :P
2011-04-24T02:50:34  <antimatroid> let them deal with it
2011-04-24T02:50:52  <McLeopold> I was thinking of creating a second food list in python, then for every 'f' line, scan the old list to determine known food and potential food
2011-04-24T02:51:20  <antimatroid> let them do that
2011-04-24T02:51:35  <antimatroid> we can cover these kinds of options in the beginners tutorial
2011-04-24T02:51:45  <antimatroid> so they have quite a few simple things to play around with to get familira
2011-04-24T02:51:47  <McLeopold> Well, I still think it's okay for the starter bots to handle the state updates
2011-04-24T02:52:35  <McLeopold> The tutorial should cover things like, "attempt to return to seen food", not "rewrite the update function to remember seen food"
2011-04-24T02:53:09  <McLeopold> The tutorial should cover possible strategies and tactics for the game, not programming techniques.
2011-04-24T02:53:33  <antimatroid> but using the information differently is different strategy/tactics
2011-04-24T02:54:16  <McLeopold> I'm making the information available.  The tutorial can discuss using it.  Others can re-write the implementation for speed or other reasons.
2011-04-24T02:54:21  <antimatroid> if you start people with the stupider idea while making it just as easy to switch, then you can make it easy for people to see their bot beat the starter bot, and from there they're hooked
2011-04-24T02:54:33  <antimatroid> but yeah, i really don't mind
2011-04-24T02:54:43  <antimatroid> just voicing my opinion on starter bots
2011-04-24T02:55:10  <McLeopold> well, you're in charge of them, but I really think we should include this
2011-04-24T02:56:21  <antimatroid> include what? :P
2011-04-24T02:56:25  <antimatroid> just to be clear
2011-04-24T02:57:05  <McLeopold> Include updating food information to know the difference between visable food and non-visable potential food.
2011-04-24T02:57:20  <McLeopold> *visible* that is
2011-04-24T02:58:08  <McLeopold> So, included remembered food in the food list, but have a flag or maintain 2 lists

2011-04-24T03:09:59  <antimatroid> but do they need a list?
2011-04-24T03:10:20  <McLeopold> well, the starter bot writer can pick the data structure
2011-04-24T03:10:22  <antimatroid> can't it be enough that they can check a location in the grid as to whether it's food and/or visible
2011-04-24T03:10:39  <McLeopold> sure

2011-04-24T03:19:58  <stocha> antimatroid: i think we said we always assume that unseen food is not there anymore.
2011-04-24T03:20:16  <antimatroid> stocha: when?
2011-04-24T03:20:20  <stocha> antimatroid: and that the R stuff wasn't desirable. Although it was not very annoying either
2011-04-24T03:20:34  <antimatroid> it was desirable for some and doesn't affect others
2011-04-24T03:20:34  <stocha> antimatroid: by we, i mean the guy you asked and me :p
2011-04-24T03:20:39  <antimatroid> giving net deirability :P
2011-04-24T03:20:43  <antimatroid> it's desireconomics
2011-04-24T03:20:54  <stocha> antimatroid: now you see that it raises questions. Wich is "bad" :p
2011-04-24T03:21:09  <stocha> Also i think there is way for implementing the game of life without indexes
2011-04-24T03:21:31  <stocha> although i wouldn't have been able too when i was 14 :p
2011-04-24T03:21:31  <McLeopold> lots of variables :P
2011-04-24T03:21:59  <stocha> and without per say arrays
2011-04-24T03:22:54  <stocha> Because you can use bit-operiations for the game of life. Where indices won't matter anymore.
2011-04-24T03:23:23  <stocha> especially if it's 15x15 in size :p
2011-04-24T03:23:46  <antimatroid> i don't think that was what they meant when they didn't use arrays
2011-04-24T03:24:22  <stocha> i don't know, i did'nt follow.
2011-04-24T03:24:32  <stocha> i just wanted to point out it wasn't impossible.
2011-04-24T03:25:20  <stocha> you can do 15x15 with 15 (16bit) registers.
2011-04-24T03:25:45  <antimatroid> multiplayer game of life would have been cool
2011-04-24T03:26:01  <stocha> you choose your starting position ?
2011-04-24T03:26:06  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-24T03:26:12  <stocha> like everyone in turn put up a piece
2011-04-24T03:26:13  <antimatroid> and you can move your squares each turn
2011-04-24T03:26:16  <antimatroid> and there's no draws
2011-04-24T03:26:31  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has left #aichallenge
2011-04-24T03:26:39  <stocha> you can move like in ant ?
2011-04-24T03:26:44  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-24T03:26:49  <antimatroid> well that's one option
2011-04-24T03:26:55  <stocha> so the life rule apply with everyone being same color ?
2011-04-24T03:27:05  <antimatroid> sort of
2011-04-24T03:27:08  <stocha> you can still use it for combat it ant.
2011-04-24T03:27:16  <stocha> and breeding.
2011-04-24T03:27:21  <antimatroid> for a new square to spawn, it needs 3 enemies exactly, so you can't draw for majority to claim spawned square
2011-04-24T03:27:33  <antimatroid> well, 3 adjacent ants
2011-04-24T03:27:56  <stocha> if you can move your ant, you will reproduce too fast.
2011-04-24T03:28:02  <stocha> unless you also need at least a food.
2011-04-24T03:28:08  <antimatroid> we fleshed out a version for fun a few months ago, but decided it wouldn't make for a great ai game
2011-04-24T03:28:12  <stocha> and the food go when the spawning is done.
2011-04-24T03:28:26  <stocha> i think ant is better.
2011-04-24T03:28:32  <stocha> the game has a lot of options.
2011-04-24T03:28:38  <antimatroid> i still like my ants game with the home bases more
2011-04-24T03:28:45  <stocha> although some would need bit investment into visualizer.
2011-04-24T03:29:09  <stocha> and also the game would be better with more time. And maybe the fog part off.
2011-04-24T03:29:14  <stocha> for an ai challenge.
2011-04-24T03:29:16  <antimatroid> fog is good
2011-04-24T03:29:23  <stocha> like 10 minutes per move, with no fog at all.
2011-04-24T03:29:34  <antimatroid> 10 minutes per move?
2011-04-24T03:29:34  <stocha> and maybe 1vs1 also.
2011-04-24T03:29:41  <antimatroid> the contest can run for a couple of years too?
2011-04-24T03:29:45  <stocha> with a probability of food appearing at each square
2011-04-24T03:29:52  <stocha> so we have all informations.
2011-04-24T03:30:10  <stocha> hey you have google for a sponsor.
2011-04-24T03:30:24  <stocha> it could run in 10 minutes :p
2011-04-24T03:31:09  <stocha> another option is to use the computing power of the participating and willing to lend computing power.
2011-04-24T03:31:28  <stocha> although you have to have games with seed. So you can submit two calculation for each match. and verify they match.
2011-04-24T03:31:31  <antimatroid> we've considered and rejected that option
2011-04-24T03:31:40  <antimatroid> we want all bots in the final tournament to have the same resources
2011-04-24T03:32:07  <stocha> Yeah you have to get rid of the "time" measurement. and find more clever metric.
2011-04-24T03:32:30  <stocha> like everything is done in a virtual machine, and you virtual clock every instructions.
2011-04-24T03:32:51  <stocha> i don't say it's simple. i just state it feasible from a theoritic point of view.
2011-04-24T03:33:11  <antimatroid> it's not feasible practically with the amount of people offering time
2011-04-24T03:33:35  <stocha> computing time. Or computer engineering time ?
2011-04-24T03:33:53  <antimatroid> how could that effect computing time?
2011-04-24T03:34:17  <stocha> you would have to start a gnu project of ai competition distributed framework. With luck you could have it ready in 3 years.
2011-04-24T03:34:43  <stocha> i don't get your question.
2011-04-24T03:35:13  <stocha> i have to go anyway. :p

2011-04-24T05:31:15  <Frontier> Now that I think about it, it has been like that for a long time now. I just always felt like there is some big organization behind it

2011-04-24T05:40:42  <_0x47> hi, is there an already implemented way of running a game without sandboxing? because my bot crashes for no reason and i can't debug with the sandbox. (currently using playgame.py)
2011-04-24T05:41:14  <_0x47> at least it says "bot 0 died" at an totally impossible point
2011-04-24T05:41:39  <janzert> the current sandbox is a fake sandbox, i.e. it isn't doing any sandboxing
2011-04-24T05:42:03  <_0x47> weird, but I still can't attach to it's process. :/ then I have to check again
2011-04-24T05:45:02  <Frontier> You can write out to a separate file for example or use stderr to get debug info on screen during a run if sigh implemented that already

2011-04-24T06:44:35  <_0x47> Frontier: that doesn't work either. I modified the python files, so that all bot output is directly forwarded to stdout (for testing). i can't get any reason why it crashes. the starter bot from antimatroid uses a loop like
2011-04-24T06:44:40  <_0x47> while(std::cin >> state)
2011-04-24T06:44:41  <_0x47>   {

2011-04-24T06:45:16  <_0x47> now, 5 to 10 round everything works fine and then suddenly - nothing
2011-04-24T06:45:50  <_0x47> end_turn() is executed just fine (next round is initiated), but it doesn't even update the "state" any more
2011-04-24T06:45:57  <_0x47> just sais bot 0 died
2011-04-24T06:46:53  <_0x47> and even if I put a __builtin_trap(); in my code, i can't get the debugger to hit. somehow the python wrapping prevents it (i guess)
2011-04-24T06:51:25  <_0x47> Frontier: Maybe, if this was already implemented, I could at least get a backtrace from the python script to the bot's log file?

2011-04-24T07:03:34  <antimatroid> i changed the starter bot today btw :P
2011-04-24T07:03:41  <antimatroid> we added a new type of input
2011-04-24T07:03:53  <_0x47> type of input?
2011-04-24T07:04:21  <antimatroid> you now get a line "r row col" if a food square no longer exists at a location that did contain a food square the last time you saw it
2011-04-24T07:04:38  <antimatroid> so in clear in square, you can get rid of isFood = 0 and process the r line
2011-04-24T07:04:59  <antimatroid> and you'll want to use a set for where food is

2011-04-24T07:41:09  <_0x47> well, it's the food vecotr, as I need to somehow track my already addressed food, this seems pretty comfortable, as it's renewed every round.
2011-04-24T07:47:05  <antimatroid> if you make use of the new information and stop wiping it
2011-04-24T07:47:13  <antimatroid> using a vector like the starter package used to wont work

2011-04-24T08:30:39  <Stocha> frontier speaks that.
2011-04-24T08:33:11  <Stocha> can't you use facebook or i don't know world of warcraft to find one indian/asian geek. once you have one, he will most likely tell you where to go to advertise to more.
2011-04-24T08:33:42  <Stocha> there is probably some in america as well, with good connection to their home country.
2011-04-24T08:38:29  <Frontier> who are you talking to? I cannot find the context.
2011-04-24T08:39:44  <MatmaRex> hey guys, would somebody care to look at Ruby starter for Ants, or tell me what do I do with it?
2011-04-24T08:39:53  <MatmaRex> I posted it to forums a few days ago and received no reply

2011-04-24T08:41:19  <Frontier> you do realize you posted it as an answer to a game idea thread?
2011-04-24T08:41:27  <Stocha> j3camero: was talking about getting some indian and asian into the contest. And also about translating some page of the website.
2011-04-24T08:41:35  <MatmaRex> i do realize, since that's where i was asked for it
2011-04-24T08:41:44  <MatmaRex> that's also why i ask once again where to post it
2011-04-24T08:42:11  <Stocha> i guess you should ask antimatroid or sigh matmarex
2011-04-24T08:43:21  <Stocha> normaly you would have to commit it using git. i don't know how the whole thing works though.
2011-04-24T08:45:28  <Stocha> Why do you want to used Rad2=4 rather than the old Rad2=5 (old civilization city radius shape) for the fighting radius2. I think 5 is more interesting.
2011-04-24T08:45:36  <Frontier> MatmaRex: Others created a git account, uploaded their starter bot there and made a "push request", so that the code gets merged into the main repository by someone with write access
2011-04-24T08:47:08  <Stocha> the warlight thread was probably not the best place to post it.

2011-04-24T09:22:22  <delt0r___> MatmaRex: the proper way is to pull, make your changes... then ask other devs to pull your changes or submit a patch from that
2011-04-24T09:22:49  <delt0r___> however I don't know what they have decided to do for this comp
2011-04-24T09:23:15  <MatmaRex> so basically, what i said above?
2011-04-24T09:23:19  <delt0r___> you shouldn't generally push without "push permission"
2011-04-24T09:23:28  <MatmaRex> i mean
2011-04-24T09:23:32  <MatmaRex> push it to my fork
2011-04-24T09:23:36  <delt0r___> oh right
2011-04-24T09:23:37  <delt0r___> yes
2011-04-24T09:23:39  <delt0r___> perfect
2011-04-24T09:23:43  <delt0r___> its the git way
2011-04-24T09:23:54  <delt0r___> I miss understood
2011-04-24T09:23:54  <MatmaRex> by the way, i just spent 20 minutes trying to pull that stuff to my PC
2011-04-24T09:24:05  <MatmaRex> that stuff is crazy.
2011-04-24T09:24:13  <delt0r___> is it large?
2011-04-24T09:24:20  <delt0r___> or your internets slow?
2011-04-24T09:24:26  <delt0r___> or are you on windows?
2011-04-24T09:24:34  <MatmaRex> no, yes, yes
2011-04-24T09:24:38  <MatmaRex> but it first took me 10 minutes to set up the remote
2011-04-24T09:24:45  <delt0r___> git kinda has not been very windows friendly..
2011-04-24T09:24:56  <MatmaRex> then it took 5 minutes after i told it to "git pull Github"
2011-04-24T09:25:01  <delt0r___> its blindingly fast on linux
2011-04-24T09:25:02  <MatmaRex> and broke saying i didnt specify branch
2011-04-24T09:25:12  <MatmaRex> it took me 5 more minutes trying to find out how to specify the damn branch
2011-04-24T09:25:25  <delt0r___> sounds right... but then you should have some kind a fecth_head
2011-04-24T09:25:32  <MatmaRex> turns out i just had to do "git pull Github epsilon"
2011-04-24T09:25:38  <delt0r___> FETCH_HEAD
2011-04-24T09:25:38  <MatmaRex> and it took like 5 seconds
2011-04-24T09:25:40  <MatmaRex> eh.
2011-04-24T09:25:52  <MatmaRex> but it seems to work now
2011-04-24T09:26:02  <delt0r___> yea.. cus the first 5 min stuff whould have been cached
2011-04-24T09:26:03  <MatmaRex> now, 20 more minutes, and i should have it up on github...
2011-04-24T09:27:00  <delt0r___> oh and sometimes github is slow for "ssh reason" IIRC
2011-04-24T09:27:06  <delt0r___> reasons
2011-04-24T09:27:37  <delt0r___> I run all my own servers for my git stuff.. and it really fast for the most part
2011-04-24T09:41:07  <MatmaRex> woohoo, works. i had to kill the whole folder and clone it again first, lol
2011-04-24T09:41:10  <MatmaRex> https://github.com/MatmaRex/aichallenge/commit/48f11e9dc2a9a106ae1bd338c987b19802daab10
2011-04-24T09:41:30  <MatmaRex> so, now i click "pull request" and I'm done?
2011-04-24T09:42:44  <MatmaRex> delt0r___: help? :)
2011-04-24T09:43:44  <delt0r___> err
2011-04-24T09:43:57  <delt0r___> don't know... i only ever use command line... pull where?
2011-04-24T09:44:18  <delt0r___> dam i going off python in a big way latetly
2011-04-24T09:44:27  <MatmaRex> i can see a shiny button saying "Pull Request" here: https://github.com/MatmaRex/aichallenge
2011-04-24T09:44:35  <MatmaRex> will anything blow when I click it?
2011-04-24T09:44:56  <delt0r___> MatmaRex: so when you pull ---you pull from somewhere to where you are... so in this context --i am unsure where "here" is

2011-04-24T09:46:01  <delt0r___> it will typically fail if something is going to get lost, and forces you to use "force" options

2011-04-24T09:48:13  <MatmaRex> worst case, somebody is going to be angry with me
2011-04-24T09:48:39  <delt0r___> yea--that about right... and since you have permission... well
2011-04-24T09:49:11  <delt0r___> MatmaRex: still i don't like githubs UI... its not clear whats getting pulled onto what
2011-04-24T09:50:02  <MatmaRex> i think i don't like git at all. ;)
2011-04-24T09:50:04  <delt0r___> MatmaRex: looks fine
2011-04-24T09:50:40  <delt0r___> git is fantastic... but the idea of distrubuted version control takes some getting use to

2011-04-24T09:50:56  <MatmaRex> distributed version control i can live with
2011-04-24T09:51:06  <MatmaRex> it's the branches and merging and everything that kills me
2011-04-24T09:51:07  <delt0r___> i am not sure github is the best place to have your first experience with it
2011-04-24T09:51:16  <delt0r___> well thats the point
2011-04-24T09:51:29  <MatmaRex> heh
2011-04-24T09:51:29  <delt0r___> without branching and merging its not distributed
2011-04-24T09:51:30  <MatmaRex> ;)
2011-04-24T09:51:42  <delt0r___> and git does do it very well
2011-04-24T09:52:34  <MatmaRex> i'm going to just believe you.
2011-04-24T09:52:58  <delt0r___> lol
2011-04-24T09:53:22  <delt0r___> MatmaRex: what other version control system have you used?
2011-04-24T09:54:09  <MatmaRex> none. i used git before, but only the simple parts
2011-04-24T09:54:27  <delt0r___> right.. well then not much to compare it too
2011-04-24T09:54:36  <MatmaRex> i mean, "git add", "git commit", "git push" was all i needed
2011-04-24T09:54:45  <MatmaRex> yeah
2011-04-24T09:55:11  <delt0r___> well push is just a little evil if you don't know what it does
2011-04-24T09:55:27  <delt0r___> you should only ever ever push to a bare repo...
2011-04-24T09:55:46  <delt0r___> github has done this in the background, but its far from clear
2011-04-24T09:55:57  <MatmaRex> i was using it with heroku, so actually, that would be "git push heroku master" - i havent even wondered what it does, it just worked
2011-04-24T09:56:22  <delt0r___> push can bork a repo thats not bare
2011-04-24T09:56:47  <delt0r___> bare means there is nothing checked out... aka no local version
2011-04-24T09:56:59  <MatmaRex> i'm going to just believe you once again ;)

2011-04-24T20:45:43  <bhasker> merged with epsilon
2011-04-24T20:45:48  <bhasker> can you try the pull again?
2011-04-24T21:01:52  <bhasker> btw in c++ can we use boost will it work on the contest server?
2011-04-24T21:02:04  <antimatroid> bhasker: congrats? :P
2011-04-24T21:02:13  <bhasker> :) thanks:D
2011-04-24T21:02:20  <bhasker> just got home today finally after 3 days
2011-04-24T21:02:29  <antimatroid> ah nice
2011-04-24T21:02:31  <bhasker> she is a joy to be around
2011-04-24T21:02:34  <antimatroid> boy/girl? name?
2011-04-24T21:02:37  <antimatroid> first one's answered
2011-04-24T21:02:38  <bhasker> girl
2011-04-24T21:02:41  <bhasker> akshara :)
2011-04-24T21:02:47  <antimatroid> :)
2011-04-24T21:03:21  <antimatroid> (11:02:04) bhasker: she is a joy to be around
2011-04-24T21:03:21  <antimatroid> you say that for now :P
2011-04-24T21:03:48  <antimatroid> i don't think boost is available (could be wrong), it might be nice if it was
2011-04-24T21:03:54  <bhasker> i am sure there will be times when i will say the contrary:) but she is a joy neverthless
2011-04-24T21:03:58  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-24T21:05:10  <bhasker> i was hoping to use some filter classes to filter standard containers
2011-04-24T21:05:12  <bhasker> and get a modified
2011-04-24T21:05:14  <bhasker> sequence
2011-04-24T21:08:05  <antimatroid> i was trying to work out before how i could best remove stuff from sets
2011-04-24T21:08:50  <antimatroid> if i have say sets of vectors of ints, maybe I want to remove everything like (0, -1, _, _) from the set
2011-04-24T21:10:46  <bhasker> hmm
2011-04-24T21:11:08  <bhasker> so each set element is a vector itself?
2011-04-24T21:11:34  <bhasker> i guess you could write a function that returns true or false for each set element
2011-04-24T21:11:53  <bhasker> let me pull up somestuff holdonf
2011-04-24T21:12:18  <antimatroid> (i'm off to a surprise 21st bbq soon, but i'll read stuff later otherwise (:)
2011-04-24T21:12:21  <bhasker> what you need is the remove_if fn from algorithms
2011-04-24T21:12:31  <antimatroid> ah cheers
2011-04-24T21:12:42  <bhasker> it takes a start/stop iterator and a predicate
2011-04-24T21:12:47  <antimatroid> i can use that for finding non-collision moves for sets of ants
2011-04-24T21:12:51  <bhasker> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/remove_if/
2011-04-24T21:14:38  <bhasker> it basically walks through the list and overwrites any that match with the next element
2011-04-24T21:15:26  <antimatroid> it seems like it might not be straight forward to pass the predicate something to match with?
2011-04-24T21:15:39  <bhasker> u can use a binder
2011-04-24T21:15:43  <antimatroid> i don't have time to play now though, so i'll look later
2011-04-24T21:15:44  <bhasker> read up on STL binder
2011-04-24T21:15:50  <antimatroid> will do :)
2011-04-24T21:15:58  <bhasker> you can basically pass a function object
2011-04-24T21:16:01  <bhasker> which binds a value
2011-04-24T21:16:09  <bhasker> and pass that as a predicate
2011-04-24T21:16:17  <bhasker> instead of a simple function
2011-04-24T21:16:46  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@210.18.207.102> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-24T21:16:48  <antimatroid> the idea is for each ant, find the set of moves not into water
2011-04-24T21:16:59  <antimatroid> then take the cartesian product of those sets to get moves in a game tree
2011-04-24T21:17:07  <antimatroid> but then remove all moves that result in cycles/collisions
2011-04-24T21:17:19  <bhasker> that just went over my head
2011-04-24T21:17:38  <bhasker> oh wait i think i understand
2011-04-24T21:17:43  <antimatroid> :)
2011-04-24T21:17:48  <bhasker> cartesian set will yield every possible combination
2011-04-24T21:17:54  <antimatroid> a cartesian product is just the set of all ordered tuples from your sets
2011-04-24T21:17:58  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-24T21:18:00  <bhasker> wont that be a really big ass tree
2011-04-24T21:18:05  <bhasker> when there are 500 ants
2011-04-24T21:18:10  <antimatroid> depends
2011-04-24T21:18:20  <antimatroid> i plan to partition them into sets of battle ants that can affect each other
2011-04-24T21:18:21  <bhasker> you better do massive pruning i guess
2011-04-24T21:18:25  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-24T21:18:25  <antimatroid> then iteratively do those smaller trees
2011-04-24T21:18:41  <bhasker> but how will you coordinate strategy
2011-04-24T21:18:46  <antimatroid> i will see where i get with that
2011-04-24T21:18:56  <antimatroid> i am only using a tree for "battles"
2011-04-24T21:19:01  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-24T21:19:02  <antimatroid> everything else i'm using heuristics for
2011-04-24T21:19:14  <bhasker> sounds like a good idea
2011-04-24T21:19:35  <antimatroid> anyway, ttyl :)
