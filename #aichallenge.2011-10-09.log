2011-10-09T02:05:31  <prathab> hi when is the contest starting and ending ?
2011-10-09T02:11:53  <UncleVasya> prathab: nobody knows. amstan said something like 'next week' on the forum but  it can be (and most likely will be) changed.
2011-10-09T02:15:50  <UncleVasya> prathab: Last one has been active for 3 months but this time admins want to make it shorter (2-2.5 months I think).
2011-10-09T02:16:53  <prathab> UncleVasya : Oh...Thank you :)
2011-10-09T02:20:44  <janzert> eashoka: hill information is given like food
2011-10-09T02:20:53  <UncleVasya> eashoka: I'm not sure I understood your question right so excuse me if this is not the answer:  info about hills comes like an info about food;
2011-10-09T02:21:19  <janzert> once the hill is destroyed the bot won't receive the information about it anymore (since it's gone)
2011-10-09T02:21:31  <UncleVasya> it means that if it is exists no more than info about it just not comes to you.
2011-10-09T02:22:19  <UncleVasya> also if you saw hill and see it no more info about it doesn't comes to you
2011-10-09T02:23:30  <UncleVasya> therefore if hill you saw but do not see anymore  was destroyed, when you'll see this square again it will be just land.
2011-10-09T02:25:12  <eashoka> janzert, UncleVasya : thanks.
2011-10-09T02:25:51  <UncleVasya> eashoka: if you are thinking about how to keep info about hills between turns, I suggest this way:
2011-10-09T02:26:59  <UncleVasya> - do not clear a list of hills between turns;
2011-10-09T02:27:22  <eashoka> UncleVasya : At the moment, I'm doing it like the same way I'm doing for unseen food. it behaved weird that's why I wanted to confirm whether my understanding of the spec is correct. looks like a bug in the code
2011-10-09T02:28:20  <eashoka> UncleVasya : yes, that's how I do it now. have to find the bug now. :-) BTW, congrats, have seen you up few steps in rankings recently
2011-10-09T02:28:26  <UncleVasya> - make an 'update list' function which returns [hills you see] + [hills that is not currently visible]
2011-10-09T02:28:42  <UncleVasya> thanks
2011-10-09T02:29:29  <eashoka> UncleVasya : have few of other qsns for you about your country if you don't mind :-)
2011-10-09T02:29:32  <UncleVasya> yep, I remember I have fought some stupid bugs with hills keeping.
2011-10-09T02:29:59  <UncleVasya> qsns - humor?
2011-10-09T02:30:04  <UncleVasya> I'm interested:)
2011-10-09T02:30:25  <UncleVasya> oh, question.
2011-10-09T02:30:27  <eashoka> is Mikhail Sholohov (a soviet era write if I have typed the name properly) a ukranian ?
2011-10-09T02:31:14  <UncleVasya> I don't know this name. Didn't like literature in school.
2011-10-09T02:32:30  <eashoka> UncleVasya : Once I had a kind of passion for Russian and soviet literature. Now that Ukrain is separate I just like to know who were the Ukranian writers I may have already red...
2011-10-09T02:34:52  <eashoka> UncleVasya : ah no worries then. :-)
2011-10-09T02:36:07  *** okay is now known as okayzed
2011-10-09T02:36:57  <UncleVasya> Russian wiki says he is Russian.
2011-10-09T02:40:00  <eashoka> UncleVasya : thanks. Think my misunderstanding came from getting the geography wrong, I thought river Don belongs to Ukrain
2011-10-09T02:40:29  <UncleVasya> I'll lurk about 'Sholohov is Ukranian' but my country now tries to take the parnt-rights to almost everything good that was in USSR. There are so many screams like 'this USSRs invention was invented by ukranians!' or 'This famous person was a native ukranian!'
2011-10-09T02:41:33  <eashoka> UncleVasya : hmm interesting :-)  You follow chess? Vassily Ivanchuk is favorite player.

2011-10-09T02:46:56  <UncleVasya> eashoka: sry, I'm not an interesting person. Mybiggest ability is just to waste a time (tv series like House, Bones; computer game Europa Universalis 3, music with female vocal). Google AI Challenge is the greetest good from all this because it at least makes me do something useful, do some learning and programming practic.
2011-10-09T02:50:17  <UncleVasya> I have found no info about 'Sholohov is ukranian'.
2011-10-09T02:52:27  <UncleVasya> eashoka: Did you heard about Rybka's disqualification?
2011-10-09T02:52:42  <eashoka> UncleVasya : yep
2011-10-09T02:52:57  <eashoka> they copied code from some other program or something like that ?
2011-10-09T02:54:26  <UncleVasya> yes. All results for previous contest (Rybka was the #1 for several years) was annulated.
2011-10-09T02:54:35  <UncleVasya> *contests
2011-10-09T02:59:07  <eashoka> hmm chess programs are now getting boring. most of them can beat most of human players.. sounds like AI has scored a complete victory there. little room for improvement I think. they have totally cracked checkers for instance.
2011-10-09T03:00:06  <UncleVasya> As about cracking chess:
2011-10-09T03:00:47  <eashoka> UncleVasya : However a game like Go could have lot of challenge for AI programmers. Sometime back I heard there is a contest for that going on.. if you are interested. :-)
2011-10-09T03:03:49  <UncleVasya> I've heard a supposition that if we take an athom-sized thing and will use it like 0-1 memory cell than we need a memory card with a size of a Moon to store all info for cracked chess.
2011-10-09T03:06:21  <UncleVasya> I haven't even played Go but I've heard that it has much more tactic and strategy than chess.
2011-10-09T03:06:31  <eashoka> UncleVasya : I didn't meant chess will be totally cracked that soon but even without totally cracking it, they have pretty much solved the game now. (meaning top programs now will beat all top players hands down) in a programming angle, looks like it is a well trodden path now. openings worked out for 20 moves or so, end game table spaces have all build etc...
2011-10-09T03:07:07  <UncleVasya> Do you play it? Go I mean.
2011-10-09T03:08:00  <eashoka> UncleVasya : nope. just heard about it. (and red some) it has lot of possibilities so difficult to crack and more strategic than tactical so harder for computer programs.
2011-10-09T03:10:09  <UncleVasya> It's funny to remember words of Garry Kasparov when journalists asked him 'can you prognose the result of your game with Deep Blue?'. He said: 'I think it's a stupid supposition that computer can beat human in chess'.
2011-10-09T03:13:55  <UncleVasya> btw, don't you want to try play Go online with me?
2011-10-09T03:15:01  <eashoka> UncleVasya : sure
2011-10-09T03:16:19  <UncleVasya> So I go to wiki to read about rules :)

2011-10-09T08:41:42  <mcstar> or somehow it un-nest the nested loops
2011-10-09T08:41:48  <mcstar> un-nests*

2011-10-09T09:30:22  <mcstar> i figured out, the -O2 optimization skips the inner loop
2011-10-09T09:30:47  <mcstar> just increments the variable with a different number (the number of the iterations of the inner loop) instead of 1

2011-10-09T16:54:13  <janzert> we're basically just waiting on some approvals from Google at this stage
2011-10-09T16:54:34  <janzert> pending that, hoping to launch within the the next week or so
2011-10-09T16:54:38  <rogue780> cool

2011-10-09T16:55:28  <janzert> well, I really think once the approvals are finished we'll be launching within a few days
2011-10-09T16:55:35  <rogue780> I've always wondered how the contest has google's name, but as far as I can tell no real google affiliation
2011-10-09T16:55:54  <janzert> the question is just how long it will take for the go ahead to happen
2011-10-09T16:56:38  <mcstar> janzert: have you convened with google yet, or did marco said next week?

2011-10-09T16:57:13  <janzert> Jeff is our link to Google and I believe he is meeting with the appropriate person(s) early this week

2011-10-09T17:34:58  <mcstar> thats the beauty
2011-10-09T17:35:25  <jbroman> Sorting by genetic algorithms. :)
2011-10-09T17:35:33  <jbroman> Permute the list, and use a heuristic to measure sortedness.
2011-10-09T17:35:52  <mcstar> ive seen a "hello world" example of genetic algorithms
2011-10-09T17:36:10  <mcstar> the fitness was the closeness to the above string
2011-10-09T17:36:32  <jbroman> Yeah, I saw that.
2011-10-09T17:38:19  <jbroman> Also, bruteforce sorting. Compute all permutations of the list then find the sorted one.

2011-10-09T17:54:39  <mcstar> and its quite funny, that the solution is in the assignment
2011-10-09T17:54:52  <mcstar> what was the point of it? learning c++?

2011-10-09T18:04:28  <rogue780> mcstar, that's the point. The class is entitled , "Datastructures in C++"
2011-10-09T18:04:46  <mcstar> so
2011-10-09T18:04:57  <mcstar> if i can help you let me know
2011-10-09T18:05:07  <rogue780> mcstar, as far as the solution being in the assignment, I'm assuming you're referring to the part where it says, "do the same as with stack, but replace pop and push with dequeue and enqueue" right?
2011-10-09T18:05:44  <mcstar> it says "substitute the queue"
2011-10-09T18:05:59  <mcstar> i cant help with the code
2011-10-09T18:06:27  <mcstar> but if you dont understand how to use the queue for the pathfinding, there i might be able to help
2011-10-09T18:06:48  <mcstar> i mean, i dont see what could be the problem
2011-10-09T18:07:08  <rogue780> right…but that doesn't work. the queue is fifo, so if I reach a dead end and I start to dequeue, it pulls off the first element (the starting point) and when the queue empties, my last element is at the dead end
2011-10-09T18:07:50  <mcstar> your queue wont be empty
2011-10-09T18:08:01  <mcstar> unless theres no way to reac the exit, and you tried all tiles
2011-10-09T18:08:34  <mcstar> as far as i see, this is only a technical question, using queue instead of a stack
2011-10-09T18:08:54  <mcstar> they are different algorithms, but the assignment isnt about this
2011-10-09T18:09:34  <rogue780> ok, let's work through this. So I start out with a newly instantiated queue with no elements. I enqueue the starting square. Then I check around it to see what square I can go to next and then I enqueue it, then I enqueue the next one, etc.
2011-10-09T18:09:59  <rogue780> When I reach a fork in the maze, I choose one path and take it. If that path is wrong…then what?
2011-10-09T18:10:01  <mcstar> lets just say "new queue", instantiagiated isnt necessary
2011-10-09T18:11:10  <rogue780> with the stack, I would just pop the top element off until I get to a square that has a direction that I haven't tried yet and then continue on from there until I reach the end. with the queue, I can't pop the end element off. I can dequeue the first element, which is the starting point
2011-10-09T18:11:10  <mcstar> if that proves to be a dead end, you access the queue from the other way, that is the earliest enqueues element
2011-10-09T18:13:49  <rogue780> I don't understand
2011-10-09T18:15:16  <rogue780> I wish this was an in-person class vice and online class
2011-10-09T18:18:36  <jbroman> mcstar: Not having read his assignment, not all queues are double-ended.
2011-10-09T18:19:47  <rogue780> jbroman, mcstar indeed. the queue class we are provided doesn't allow us to take off from the back
2011-10-09T18:20:54  <jbroman> I mean, it sounds like straightforward bread-first search to me.

2011-10-09T18:21:37  <mcstar> you queue all the neighbots you encountered
2011-10-09T18:21:42  <mcstar> yes, bfs
2011-10-09T18:21:50  <mcstar> neigbors
2011-10-09T18:22:52  <mcstar> rogue780: the stack based is the depth first, meaning you scan a whole path
2011-10-09T18:23:03  <rogue780> that would mean using a tree, right? for BFS?
2011-10-09T18:23:09  <mcstar> this is breadth, you check every possible tile for up to a given length
2011-10-09T18:23:32  <mcstar> you can reconstruct it as a tree
2011-10-09T18:23:39  <mcstar> but you dont store you tiles in a tree
2011-10-09T18:23:50  <mcstar> (whats with my typos)
2011-10-09T18:24:14  <jbroman> s/bread/breadth/
2011-10-09T18:24:19  <jbroman> (unless you are in a bakery)
2011-10-09T18:24:36  <mcstar> actually, you could, if you were to implement a priority queue based on a fast heap
2011-10-09T18:24:51  <rogue780> The queue implementation is not up to me
2011-10-09T18:24:59  <mcstar> doesnt matter
2011-10-09T18:25:07  <mcstar> do you know what we are talking about?
2011-10-09T18:25:39  <rogue780> So, I would only have one queue, then? Or are you talking about multiple queues here?
2011-10-09T18:25:47  <mcstar> no
2011-10-09T18:25:55  <mcstar> The One Queue
2011-10-09T18:26:06  <rogue780> ok. so I have one queue. I am at the starting point at 0,0
2011-10-09T18:26:29  <rogue780> I look in every direction and enqueue every square that I can move on
2011-10-09T18:27:24  <rogue780> then I do the same thing with the most recently enqueued square, and so on…?
2011-10-09T18:29:02  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-09T18:29:18  <mcstar> you know where you are from the bottom of the queue
2011-10-09T18:29:28  <mcstar> (the earlies enqueued element)Å±
2011-10-09T18:29:34  <mcstar> and you add the neigbors
2011-10-09T18:31:07  <mcstar> of course this requires a lot of testing
2011-10-09T18:31:36  <rogue780> so, let's say I'm at 0,0
2011-10-09T18:31:53  <mcstar> i mean, i would remove the position from the end of the queue
2011-10-09T18:32:12  <mcstar> but then i would need to store paths on the board
2011-10-09T18:32:25  <mcstar> are you allowed to use anything other than the queue?
2011-10-09T18:32:27  <mcstar> i guess not
2011-10-09T18:32:43  <mcstar> it can be done, but i dont think its efficient
2011-10-09T18:33:01  <rogue780> 0,1 and 1,0 are good paths. I do queue.enqueue(Square01) and queue.enqueue(Square10) so now Square10 is the last thing on my queue…and I can't get rid of it if it turns out bad unless I clear the whole queue
2011-10-09T18:34:59  <rogue780> I'm just having a hard time thinking of how to keep track of the paths that I haven't taken yet so I can make sure I go back and check them out too

2011-10-09T18:35:22  <mcstar> i guess its better if you could use multiple queues
2011-10-09T18:35:49  <mcstar> you must have more thoroughly read the assignment than me, can you or not?
2011-10-09T18:36:51  <mcstar> no, i think im thinking in terms of stacks again
2011-10-09T18:37:05  <rogue780> it doesn't explicitly say, though at the end of the criteria it says "When the program ends, all stacks and queues must be empty." so it does pluralize queues...
2011-10-09T18:37:48  <rogue780> so, I suppose I could have several queues
2011-10-09T18:37:59  <rogue780> I did solve it using a single stack, thoguh
2011-10-09T18:38:03  <rogue780> *though
2011-10-09T18:38:09  <mcstar> yes
2011-10-09T18:41:23  <mcstar> ok
2011-10-09T18:41:29  <mcstar> typing
2011-10-09T18:42:12  <mcstar> so lets say youcant remove elements from the queue, you start adding tiles to the queue, until you hit a dead end
2011-10-09T18:42:20  <mcstar> than you go back to the start-pointer
2011-10-09T18:42:36  <mcstar> lets call this thing the start -pointer, or it could be last-good-choice-pointer
2011-10-09T18:42:38  <mcstar> whatever
2011-10-09T18:42:51  <mcstar> at first it points to the earliest element of the queue
2011-10-09T18:43:01  <mcstar> after you hit a dead end, you go back to it
2011-10-09T18:43:19  <mcstar> you try another path, that you havent tried before
2011-10-09T18:43:28  <mcstar> sou you take another turn, from the start
2011-10-09T18:43:56  <mcstar> if the start position doesnt provide you any other free directions, you advance the start-pointer, until you fiond a tile that does
2011-10-09T18:44:21  <mcstar> you walk throught that new path too, maybe its the exit, maybe another dead end
2011-10-09T18:45:07  <mcstar> if it is, you go back to the start-pointer, and if there are unexplored paths, go for them, otherwise advance the pointer for a new tile that provides free direcitons
2011-10-09T18:45:14  <mcstar> this is not BFS
2011-10-09T18:45:24  <mcstar> yuo will be able to recover the path
2011-10-09T18:45:40  <mcstar> with bfs, and one queue, i dont thinkthat'd be possible
2011-10-09T18:45:54  <mcstar> rogue780: what do you think?
2011-10-09T18:46:13  <_flag> So, wasn't launch supposed to be today?
2011-10-09T18:47:01  <mcstar> (when you are at the start-pointer, and looking for a new tile, that isnt after the start-pointer, you should search the queue for it, and the search must fail, for you to continue on that path)
2011-10-09T18:47:30  <mcstar> btw, by pointer i dont mean c pointer, just my finger pointing to it, but sure, you can implement it as a pointer
2011-10-09T18:47:52  <mcstar> but im not sure c++ lets you do that if that class or whatever is abstracted out
2011-10-09T18:48:06  <mcstar> can you index the queue that is provided for you?
2011-10-09T18:48:23  <mcstar> or do you must access it elemnt-wise, like a list?
