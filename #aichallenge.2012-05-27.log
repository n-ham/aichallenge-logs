2012-05-27T22:29:04  <jmcarthur> i kind of want some sort of a game that emphasizes cooperation despite being competitive
2012-05-27T22:29:14  <jmcarthur> i think it would be neat
2012-05-27T22:29:29  <ermau> It'd be interesting to have teams
2012-05-27T22:29:37  <jmcarthur> i don't really mean teams
2012-05-27T22:29:52  <jmcarthur> i mean you have to work with some of your enemies to achieve your goals in the game at all
2012-05-27T22:29:57  <ermau> but really I'd like to see one of the good games run indefinitely
2012-05-27T22:30:00  <ermau> ah
2012-05-27T22:30:18  <jmcarthur> a game that involves trade might be an example
2012-05-27T22:31:25  <jmcarthur> there are some resources that each player needs in order to win, but the original distribution of those resources is insufficient
2012-05-27T22:31:50  <jmcarthur> or some variation
