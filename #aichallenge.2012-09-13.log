2012-09-13T09:40:24  <mcstar> antimatroid1: like this? http://i.imgur.com/sCKy8.jpg
2012-09-13T09:43:48  <mcstar> antimatroid1: (i know you dont mean it like that, it was just an attempt to show you my desktop)
2012-09-13T09:44:03  <mcstar> anyway, you really dont need a 'taskbar'
2012-09-13T09:44:20  <mcstar> i think its a taskbar that you were describing
2012-09-13T09:44:56  <mcstar> and feel free to switch to kde anytime, it was almost always better than gnome
2012-09-13T09:47:09  <antimatroid1> mcstar: it no longer tells me when you talk to  me :(
2012-09-13T09:47:22  <antimatroid1> and yes like that, i hate it
2012-09-13T09:47:23  <mcstar> what client?
2012-09-13T09:47:28  <antimatroid1> pidgin
2012-09-13T09:47:32  <antimatroid1> always pidgin
2012-09-13T09:47:39  <mcstar> i guess you have to set nick highlight
2012-09-13T09:47:41  <antimatroid1> if an app has a cool name and it's free i use it :P
2012-09-13T09:47:50  <mcstar> antimatroid1: always? you used adium before
2012-09-13T09:47:56  <mcstar> so dont tell me always
2012-09-13T09:48:04  <antimatroid1> that was on osx
2012-09-13T09:48:08  <antimatroid1> osx doesn't count
2012-09-13T09:48:16  <mcstar> aha, ok
2012-09-13T09:48:35  <antimatroid1> can one install a taskbar?
2012-09-13T09:48:37  <antimatroid1> they are the shit
2012-09-13T09:48:44  <antimatroid1> i don't understand why new os's don't have them
2012-09-13T09:48:44  <mcstar> antimatroid1: anyway, you dont need a taskbar, use multiple workspaces, thats the first you get to used to
2012-09-13T09:48:55  <antimatroid1> i do use multiple workspaces
2012-09-13T09:49:15  <antimatroid1> it doesn't even change the icons on the right if somone has talked to me or whatever
2012-09-13T09:49:19  <antimatroid1> how is that meant to be useful?
2012-09-13T09:49:24  <antimatroid1> left*
2012-09-13T09:49:29  <mcstar> antimatroid1: it is pidgin's fault
2012-09-13T09:49:36  <mcstar> not the dock's
2012-09-13T09:49:48  <mcstar> it will do something, if the app sends a notification
2012-09-13T09:49:58  <mcstar> but pidging didnt sent any
2012-09-13T09:50:02  <antimatroid1> i can't even find options aha
2012-09-13T09:50:14  <mcstar> antimatroid1: why dont you switch to kde?
2012-09-13T09:50:19  <mcstar> the new gnome sucks
2012-09-13T09:50:24  <antimatroid1> what's the difference?
2012-09-13T09:50:39  <mcstar> antimatroid1: give me a screenshot
2012-09-13T09:50:45  <mcstar> i dont know how the new ubuntu looks
2012-09-13T09:51:00  <mcstar> but the new gnome 3 is really quite bad to use
2012-09-13T09:51:08  <mcstar> on the other hand kde is super configurable
2012-09-13T09:51:28  <antimatroid1> uploading
2012-09-13T09:51:32  <mcstar> and i no longer need to hack config files or hack the source to get my features :)

2012-09-13T09:52:53  <mcstar> antimatroid1: do you see those numbered squares on the left of my screenshot?
2012-09-13T09:53:12  <mcstar> those are my virtual desktops, it better when you can click on each one of them
2012-09-13T09:53:25  <antimatroid1> yes, but i can just use ctrl shift arrows to move between workspaces
2012-09-13T09:53:29  <antimatroid1> i already use them
2012-09-13T09:53:35  <mcstar> i use super+n
2012-09-13T09:53:44  <antimatroid1> i still like one workspace for internet and chat
2012-09-13T09:53:44  <mcstar> or super+arrows
2012-09-13T09:53:52  <antimatroid1> then projects/work get a workspace each
2012-09-13T09:54:11  <antimatroid1> ctrl alt shift arrows moves the active window between workspaces too
2012-09-13T09:54:14  <mcstar> ctrl+shift+stuff is too much trouble
2012-09-13T09:54:19  <mcstar> anyway, leave those to emacs
2012-09-13T09:54:22  <antimatroid1> something which is not easily done on osx grrrr
2012-09-13T09:54:29  <antimatroid1> it's not that hard :P
2012-09-13T09:54:32  <mcstar> it is
2012-09-13T09:54:46  <mcstar> thats why i changed my window navigation prefix to simply Super
2012-09-13T09:54:58  <antimatroid1> i really liked my old ubuntu install :(
2012-09-13T09:55:07  <antimatroid1> it was perfect out of the box
2012-09-13T09:55:11  <antimatroid1> and they ruined it
2012-09-13T09:55:27  <mcstar> you dont have to use the default settings
2012-09-13T09:55:43  <mcstar> kde lets you customize many details, without using a registry editor, like gnome
2012-09-13T09:56:09  <mcstar> arch is better in this regard, i think, it doesnt have default desktop env.
2012-09-13T09:56:17  <mcstar> you make up your own
2012-09-13T09:56:18  <antimatroid1> i don't want to have to customise though aha
2012-09-13T09:56:26  <mcstar> you only need to do it once
2012-09-13T09:56:30  <mcstar> and it will fit
2012-09-13T09:56:36  <mcstar> i think it worth it
2012-09-13T09:57:12  <mcstar> antimatroid1: id be still using awesome, if it had a session manager
2012-09-13T09:57:55  <mcstar> lately, i was working with many documents, like papers and stuff, and i wanted my documents restored on new logins
2012-09-13T09:58:17  <mcstar> but otherwise, i still like tiling wms
2012-09-13T09:58:48  <mcstar> but mostly, i wasnt using tiling per say, almost always i had my windows maximed
2012-09-13T09:58:59  <antimatroid1> so i do
2012-09-13T09:59:04  <antimatroid1> but i like one click access to each window
2012-09-13T09:59:08  <mcstar> i have a 17" monitor, if i had a bigger one, id benefit more from tiling...
2012-09-13T09:59:09  <antimatroid1> now this multi click bs
2012-09-13T09:59:44  <antimatroid1> normal ubuntu now alt tabs between applications too
2012-09-13T09:59:50  <antimatroid1> fucking apple copying
2012-09-13T09:59:59  <antimatroid1> why would you copy something that is shit? :P
2012-09-13T10:00:18  <mcstar> antimatroid1: i can either alt-tab to a window, or hover the mouse over the icon on the dock, pops up promptly a list of views, and select the window, or click on the icon, and it present the windows of that application on the whole screen
2012-09-13T10:00:41  <antimatroid1> gross
2012-09-13T10:00:54  <mcstar> antimatroid1: one of the best thing on osx was, that i was able to switch between open windows of A given application with command+~
2012-09-13T10:01:14  <antimatroid1> yeah, cause alt tab goes between applications, which is gross
2012-09-13T10:01:14  <mcstar> and now, kde has that too
2012-09-13T10:01:24  <mcstar> no, its the sane thing to do
2012-09-13T10:01:51  <mcstar> you just got used to the way windows does it
2012-09-13T10:01:53  <antimatroid1> do they do the same crap with alt tabbing across workspaces?
2012-09-13T10:01:57  <mcstar> it doesnt make it good
2012-09-13T10:02:18  <mcstar> antimatroid1: all the icons and tabbing is workspace specific for me
2012-09-13T10:02:19  <antimatroid1> which is no longer idempotent and often leaves you stuck in a given space
2012-09-13T10:02:23  <mcstar> i like it that way
2012-09-13T10:02:28  <mcstar> workspaces stay separated
2012-09-13T10:02:30  <antimatroid1> yes so do i
2012-09-13T10:02:39  <mcstar> you can set it though
2012-09-13T10:02:48  <antimatroid1> but by window (which i have atm anyway using ubuntu 2d, i don't like all the gui effects and crap either :P)
2012-09-13T10:03:15  <mcstar> i like some, those which are actually useful
2012-09-13T10:03:32  <mcstar> like the present windows/present windows of an app
2012-09-13T10:03:43  <mcstar> oh, and the logout effect
2012-09-13T10:03:48  <mcstar> i use those 3
2012-09-13T10:03:54  <antimatroid1> i rarely logout/restart
2012-09-13T10:04:04  <mcstar> i hibernate every night
2012-09-13T10:04:12  <mcstar> why should i keep it running?
2012-09-13T10:04:18  <antimatroid1> i put a movie on when i go to bed :P
2012-09-13T10:04:23  <mcstar> and i cant sleep if it is on
2012-09-13T10:04:28  <mcstar> i never do that
2012-09-13T10:04:37  <antimatroid1> i turn the screen off and have a timer on the tv
2012-09-13T10:04:37  <mcstar> i was experimenting with that years ago
2012-09-13T10:05:05  <mcstar> i need quality rest
2012-09-13T10:05:31  <mcstar> idk if i said it already, the dogs sometimes go crazy at nigh, on our street
2012-09-13T10:05:42  <mcstar> so i almost every night sleep with earplugs
2012-09-13T10:05:53  <mcstar> night*
2012-09-13T10:06:24  <antimatroid1> dogs are awesome
2012-09-13T10:06:29  <mcstar> antimatroid1: oh, and do you see that icon in the left-bottom corner?
2012-09-13T10:06:33  <antimatroid1> but i've never had that much problem with barking dogs
2012-09-13T10:06:40  <antimatroid1> the trash?
2012-09-13T10:06:48  <mcstar> if you click that, you can see the title of every window open
2012-09-13T10:06:54  <mcstar> and select it
2012-09-13T10:07:02  <antimatroid1> on yours?
2012-09-13T10:07:08  <mcstar> if yes
2012-09-13T10:07:10  <mcstar> -if
2012-09-13T10:07:12  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-13T10:07:18  <antimatroid1> again just like osx
2012-09-13T10:07:24  <mcstar> really?
2012-09-13T10:07:26  <antimatroid1> how original
2012-09-13T10:07:42  <mcstar> come on, is just an icon
2012-09-13T10:07:45  <antimatroid1> yes, they use the f11 etc for that kind of thing
2012-09-13T10:07:49  <mcstar> kde and gnome had that from the beginning
2012-09-13T10:08:00  <mcstar> antimatroid1: no, thats the present window effect
2012-09-13T10:08:04  <mcstar> antimatroid1: this is just a list
2012-09-13T10:08:33  <antimatroid1> ah fair enough :P
2012-09-13T10:08:33  <antimatroid1> all this new fangles stuff :P

2012-09-13T10:12:48  <mcstar> the good thing with linux, is that you really have a choise
2012-09-13T10:12:50  <mcstar> choice
2012-09-13T10:12:55  <mcstar> use whatever you like
2012-09-13T10:13:00  <mcstar> and dont use what you dont like
2012-09-13T10:13:25  <mcstar> if a feature is handy/useful/you can grow used to, then use it, no matter where it originates
2012-09-13T10:14:28  <antimatroid1> brb

2012-09-13T10:19:28  <antimatroid> would that require a restart maybe?

2012-09-13T10:22:45  <antimatroid> k, i'm much happier now
2012-09-13T10:24:36  <mcstar> antimatroid: i think theres a word, 'rouse' or similar that can mean deceit, whats the spelling?
2012-09-13T10:25:16  <mcstar> similar to double play, maybe
2012-09-13T10:25:55  <mcstar> if thats a phrase at all..
2012-09-13T10:26:11  <antimatroid> mcstar: nic me again
2012-09-13T10:26:18  <mcstar> antimatroid:
2012-09-13T10:26:37  <antimatroid> damn, that didn't work
2012-09-13T10:26:40  <mcstar> will you help with my vocubulary?
2012-09-13T10:26:49  <antimatroid> how so?
2012-09-13T10:26:54  <antimatroid> maybe i need to restart pidgin for a plugin to work
2012-09-13T10:27:03  <mcstar> antimatroid: read my question
2012-09-13T10:27:15  <mcstar> before 'nic me again'
2012-09-13T10:27:35  <antimatroid> double play?
2012-09-13T10:27:43  <antimatroid> not sure what it means, but it doesn't soud wrong
2012-09-13T10:27:43  <mcstar> before
2012-09-13T10:27:48  <antimatroid> oh :P
2012-09-13T10:28:07  <mcstar> 3 lines, one train of thought
2012-09-13T10:28:14  <antimatroid> not sure if i've heard rouse in that context
2012-09-13T10:28:25  <mcstar> maybe it isnt written that way
2012-09-13T10:28:28  <antimatroid> but i am not amazing at my own language :P
2012-09-13T10:28:30  <mcstar> but sounds very much like it
2012-09-13T10:29:19  <antimatroid> http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rouse
2012-09-13T10:29:48  <antimatroid> "to stir or incite to strong indignation or anger."
2012-09-13T10:29:54  <antimatroid> that's what i think of when i hear it
2012-09-13T10:29:57  <antimatroid> rousing up your mates

2012-09-13T10:44:08  <antimatroid> which is not in general a property that holds
2012-09-13T10:44:33  <antimatroid> ie if I is and ideal of J which is an ideal of R it does not  necessarily follow that I is an ideal of R
2012-09-13T10:44:41  <antimatroid> /s/and/an
2012-09-13T10:44:43  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-13T10:44:45  <mcstar> i was right
2012-09-13T10:44:50  <mcstar> ruse
2012-09-13T10:45:04  <mcstar> fortely, csel, fogas
2012-09-13T10:45:14  <mcstar> and i use it in the right context
2012-09-13T10:45:20  <mcstar> what more can i ask for :)
2012-09-13T10:45:44  <mcstar> used*
2012-09-13T10:46:44  <mcstar> antimatroid: that is a very general theorem, or lemma
2012-09-13T10:46:48  <mcstar> was that not known?
2012-09-13T10:47:32  <antimatroid> i don't think he actually came up with much new for his honours thesis
2012-09-13T10:47:33  <antimatroid> it
2012-09-13T10:47:37  <antimatroid> 's a known thing to play with
2012-09-13T10:47:42  <antimatroid> i don't know a huge amount about it
2012-09-13T10:50:58  <mcstar> antimatroid: did you see that i said 'now i know why did you name your diagrams 'words''?
2012-09-13T10:52:04  <mcstar> from another topic i somehow navigated to this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics)
2012-09-13T10:52:07  <antimatroid> nope?
2012-09-13T10:52:11  <antimatroid> but yes from that
2012-09-13T10:52:23  <antimatroid> the word problem comes into play
2012-09-13T10:52:31  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you know about the braird-group?
2012-09-13T10:52:35  <antimatroid> yes
2012-09-13T10:52:38  <antimatroid> not much about it
2012-09-13T10:52:39  <antimatroid> i know what it is
2012-09-13T10:52:47  <mcstar> i did read about it very much earlier
2012-09-13T10:52:58  <mcstar> and yesterday, or the day before i navigated to that too :)
2012-09-13T10:53:10  <mcstar> i was trying to fit your diagrams into brairds
2012-09-13T10:53:14  <antimatroid> yeah, eventually i need to bridge the gap from what i'm doing to what's useful for physicists
2012-09-13T10:53:18  <antimatroid> and learn character theory
2012-09-13T10:53:22  <antimatroid> and representation theory
2012-09-13T10:53:34  <antimatroid> they aren't braids :P
2012-09-13T10:53:44  <mcstar> braird
2012-09-13T10:53:57  <mcstar> no
2012-09-13T10:53:59  <mcstar> braid
2012-09-13T10:54:03  <mcstar> they arent
2012-09-13T10:54:05  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_theory wut :s
2012-09-13T10:54:18  <mcstar> but you can make them look like braid diagrams
2012-09-13T10:55:02  <antimatroid> not really cause of the triapses
2012-09-13T10:55:09  <mcstar> antimatroid: just imagine, that your diagrams are rotated, so now, the triple bridges in the generators stand vertically
2012-09-13T10:55:45  <mcstar> now, imagine, that you see that line, between 3 nodes, because the real nodes are very close together
2012-09-13T10:55:57  <antimatroid> wut?
2012-09-13T10:56:06  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-13T10:56:15  <mcstar> let me ilustrate
2012-09-13T10:56:20  <mcstar> ..
2012-09-13T10:56:22  <mcstar> 2 dots
2012-09-13T10:56:28  <antimatroid> sketchia
2012-09-13T10:56:31  <antimatroid> is the shit
2012-09-13T10:56:31  <mcstar> if you walk farther, you will see 1 dot
2012-09-13T10:56:37  <mcstar> i dont sketchia
2012-09-13T10:56:42  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-13T10:56:47  <mcstar> cant draw with mouse
2012-09-13T10:56:54  <mcstar> whatever, ill do it
2012-09-13T10:57:32  <antimatroid> brb going to make milo

2012-09-13T11:00:02  <antimatroid> back
2012-09-13T11:01:46  <antimatroid> braidify for me
2012-09-13T11:03:01  <mcstar> lol
2012-09-13T11:03:05  <mcstar> i didnt say i was ready
2012-09-13T11:03:14  <mcstar> btw, that drawing is horrible
2012-09-13T11:03:26  <mcstar> learn to connect them with straight lines, for the love of god
2012-09-13T11:03:27  <antimatroid> milo is awesome
2012-09-13T11:03:47  <antimatroid> nope :P
2012-09-13T11:04:08  <mcstar> look now
2012-09-13T11:04:10  <mcstar> much better
2012-09-13T11:04:24  <mcstar> or, just use numbers, thats ok too
2012-09-13T11:04:37  <mcstar> though, hard to draw on sketchia
2012-09-13T11:05:04  <mcstar> antimatroid: you can imagine blowing up a triapse into 3 columns too
2012-09-13T11:05:17  <mcstar> i worked out 1 multiplication
2012-09-13T11:05:20  <mcstar> it sort of workd
2012-09-13T11:05:49  <mcstar> i gave up, im just saying, there might be some natural connection, idk
2012-09-13T11:06:40  <antimatroid> hmm okay
2012-09-13T11:06:45  <antimatroid> i will play with the idea eventually
2012-09-13T11:06:56  <antimatroid> i kind of see what you mean with the triapsis
2012-09-13T11:06:58  *** janzert <janzert!~janzert@97-83-125-49.dhcp.trcy.mi.charter.com> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2012-09-13T11:07:07  <antimatroid> you could do a similar thing with a diapsis
2012-09-13T11:07:11  <antimatroid> and napsis in general

2012-09-13T11:08:45  <antimatroid> a triapsis could be one of a few braids though
2012-09-13T11:09:10  <antimatroid> ie. the bottom to top edge could go over/under each of the other two
2012-09-13T11:09:39  <antimatroid> and could be flipped vertically
2012-09-13T11:10:14  <mcstar> there are variations
2012-09-13T11:10:27  <mcstar> and im not sure how to handle the endpoints
2012-09-13T11:10:48  <mcstar> i.e. indentify the left side noded with the right side ones?(in my drawing)
2012-09-13T11:11:00  <mcstar> that would be like closed-loop braids
2012-09-13T11:12:14  <antimatroid> see the 8 i just drew?
2012-09-13T11:12:16  <antimatroid> that's all options
2012-09-13T11:13:03  <mcstar> yeah
2012-09-13T11:13:18  <mcstar> am not sure what relevance does the over/under have
2012-09-13T11:13:27  <antimatroid> braids remember over/under
2012-09-13T11:13:31  <mcstar> i know
2012-09-13T11:13:32  <antimatroid> hence the name braid
2012-09-13T11:13:37  <mcstar> but im not sure what does it mean here
2012-09-13T11:13:43  <antimatroid> no idea
2012-09-13T11:13:44  <mcstar> for you diagrams
2012-09-13T11:13:45  <mcstar> r
2012-09-13T11:13:50  <antimatroid> i'm not sure if this is really useful though
2012-09-13T11:13:57  <mcstar> basically, it have to be imdenepndent of that
2012-09-13T11:14:01  <antimatroid> cause the triapses don't really connect
2012-09-13T11:14:32  <mcstar> me neither, i just thought id tell you what i was thinking
2012-09-13T11:14:49  <antimatroid> yep :)

2012-09-13T11:23:20  <mcstar> antimatroid: on second thought, it might be better, to leave the orientation of diagrams unchaned, and write the . _ . as a braid
2012-09-13T11:23:32  *** sigh_ <sigh_!~sigh@ppp114-153.static.internode.on.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-09-13T11:24:34  <Kim> Hello my name is Kim a newly started Computer Science student, me and a few fellow students are looking into joining the AI Challenge, is there any information when the sign up will open up again?
2012-09-13T11:24:50  <mcstar> but then, to make connections between non-adjacent nodes, you would need to up the order of the braid
2012-09-13T11:25:20  <mcstar> Kim: there are no explicit plans for a next context
2012-09-13T11:25:22  <mcstar> contest
2012-09-13T11:25:43  <mcstar> it will happen, but for certain organizational issues, it is not decided when
2012-09-13T11:25:54  <Kim> ah okay
2012-09-13T11:26:23  <mcstar> Kim: you can use the framework for you own purposes
2012-09-13T11:26:35  <mcstar> i.e. pretend, there is a contest, and play your bots against each other
2012-09-13T11:26:42  <Kim> ah cool!
2012-09-13T11:26:46  <mcstar> and the against the ones you can find on the internet
2012-09-13T11:26:51  <mcstar> it just wont be 'official'
2012-09-13T11:27:04  <mcstar> Kim: setting up a tcp server is not that hard
2012-09-13T11:27:19  <Kim> That is definately okay, then we can exercise locally untill a official contest opens up :)
2012-09-13T11:27:29  <mcstar> we call a server that matches unofficially bots internet-wide a tcp server
2012-09-13T11:27:47  <mcstar> Kim: it wont be Ants again
2012-09-13T11:28:05  <Kim> oh okay, so it changes all the time?
2012-09-13T11:28:16  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-13T11:28:30  <Kim> Either way, any AI challenge will sure teach us alot about AI programming
2012-09-13T11:28:31  <mcstar> it was tictactoe the first time, though i think that was in-house
2012-09-13T11:28:36  <mcstar> then tron
2012-09-13T11:28:39  <mcstar> then planetwars
2012-09-13T11:28:42  <mcstar> then ants
2012-09-13T11:28:51  <mcstar> and now, soemthing else, when it happens
2012-09-13T11:28:51  <Kim> ah okay, how long does a contest run?
2012-09-13T11:28:58  <mcstar> roughly 2 months
2012-09-13T11:29:06  <Kim> okay
2012-09-13T11:29:17  <mcstar> Kim: no, it wont teach you much
2012-09-13T11:29:24  <mcstar> at least, not ai
2012-09-13T11:29:31  <mcstar> but you will learn a lot
2012-09-13T11:30:01  <mcstar> you will use algorithms and such that you didnt know about, sure, but those arent really Ai these days
2012-09-13T11:30:14  <Kim> oh okay
2012-09-13T11:30:35  <mcstar> but it is a challenge to implement a strategy that works or wins the game
2012-09-13T11:30:55  <mcstar> most of the algorithms are known to every participants
2012-09-13T11:31:07  <Kim> Yes :) - Do you know about Greenfoot interlude greep scenario?
2012-09-13T11:31:21  <Kim> Its an AI contest, and we are currently trying to make the best AI in our class
2012-09-13T11:31:23  <mcstar> but they cant implement equal strategies or implement them equally good
2012-09-13T11:31:39  <mcstar> no, im not familiar with that
2012-09-13T11:32:13  <Kim> okay just wondered if it was kinda the same as AI Challenge.
2012-09-13T11:32:31  <mcstar> i have no idea, ill read about it
2012-09-13T11:33:21  <Kim> No need :) We will return to AI Challenge now and then to check up when the new contest begins, and give you all a fair challenge "Atleast I hope we might not end last :)"
2012-09-13T11:34:33  <mcstar> only a negligible number or persons win and score the last
2012-09-13T11:34:38  <mcstar> i.e 1 and 1
2012-09-13T11:34:46  <mcstar> probably you wont be either one of those :)
2012-09-13T11:34:56  <mcstar> of*
2012-09-13T11:35:36  <Kim> :)
2012-09-13T11:35:46  <mcstar> Kim: one of the reasons aichallenge is attractive, because it lets you use any language you want
2012-09-13T11:35:52  <Kim> Is it possible to join in as teams or is it only 1 man teams?
2012-09-13T11:36:10  <mcstar> i think you can team up
2012-09-13T11:36:20  <mcstar> but you cant make more than 1 account
2012-09-13T11:36:22  <Kim> Exactly that I found very interresting, we would probably use Java since that is our class language
2012-09-13T11:36:35  <mcstar> hehe
2012-09-13T11:36:40  <mcstar> java is quite mainstream
2012-09-13T11:37:09  <Kim> Yes 1 account per group as I understand, yes I find java very easy to learn :)
2012-09-13T11:37:30  <mcstar> well, i dont care for java
2012-09-13T11:37:43  <mcstar> and if you are a CS student, you shouldnt either
2012-09-13T11:37:48  <Kim> huh?
2012-09-13T11:37:50  <mcstar> (how arrogant i am, i know)
2012-09-13T11:38:01  <mcstar> Kim: learn lisp and ml
2012-09-13T11:38:16  <mcstar> if they dont teach them to you
2012-09-13T11:38:49  <Kim> They probably wont, why should I learn lisp and ml ?
2012-09-13T11:39:19  <mcstar> those are 2 of the languages, other languages go for new features
2012-09-13T11:39:50  <mcstar> anyway, just go and read about them
2012-09-13T11:39:58  <mcstar> theres plenty of material on the net
2012-09-13T11:40:08  <antimatroid> Kim: c++ :P
2012-09-13T11:40:13  <mcstar> blah
2012-09-13T11:40:18  <antimatroid> ahaha
2012-09-13T11:40:19  <Kim> I don't understand why lisp and ml would be better to learn than java or as antimatroid says C++
2012-09-13T11:40:21  <mcstar> Kim: dont listen to him, he is the dark side
2012-09-13T11:40:31  <antimatroid> really, don't listen to me
2012-09-13T11:40:34  <antimatroid> but learn python
2012-09-13T11:40:39  <antimatroid> don't listen to mcstar either
2012-09-13T11:40:42  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-13T11:40:43  <antimatroid> haskell wouldn't hurt either
2012-09-13T11:40:51  <antimatroid> learn all the thingsd
2012-09-13T11:40:53  <mcstar> yeah, im not saying he should
2012-09-13T11:40:58  <mcstar> just trying to broaden his horizon
2012-09-13T11:41:24  <mcstar> i said: aichallenge is great, cause you can use any language, and then he says: exactly, and i use java
2012-09-13T11:41:33  <mcstar> im kind of disappointed
2012-09-13T11:41:36  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-13T11:41:37  <Kim> How about I just learn how programming languages work, then it won't matter which language I use for whichever task, since its "basicly" all the same with another syntax :)
2012-09-13T11:41:48  <antimatroid> mcstar: you forgot the rock paper scissors contest that amstan won
2012-09-13T11:42:00  <mcstar> antimatroid: i said tictactoe
2012-09-13T11:42:01  <antimatroid> Kim: they're not all basically the same
2012-09-13T11:42:08  <mcstar> porbably i meant rock paper scissors
2012-09-13T11:42:08  <antimatroid> they're different games
2012-09-13T11:42:18  <mcstar> antimatroid: lol, i know
2012-09-13T11:42:26  <antimatroid> Kim: most winners have done so from minimax trees
2012-09-13T11:42:27  <mcstar> but i forgot, and said tictactoe
2012-09-13T11:42:37  <antimatroid> tron is the easiest game to implement an ai for
2012-09-13T11:42:42  <antimatroid> so i would suggest you go with that
2012-09-13T11:42:47  <antimatroid> it's also a lot of fun to do and watch
2012-09-13T11:42:57  <antimatroid> planet wars is a beast of a problem
2012-09-13T11:43:04  <antimatroid> ants is probably better as a second game to touch
2012-09-13T11:43:08  <Kim> minimax tree?
2012-09-13T11:43:20  <mcstar> all wiki-searchable
2012-09-13T11:43:37  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax
2012-09-13T11:43:53  <antimatroid> a lot of people use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning but i don't like it
2012-09-13T11:43:58  <Kim> reading now :) just googled it
2012-09-13T11:44:16  <antimatroid> bear in mind game tree's are ridiculously large
2012-09-13T11:44:24  <mcstar> antimatroid: i dont think the tree itself was the key, rather scoring the nodes
2012-09-13T11:44:27  <antimatroid> like you think computers can handle big shit? not game trees, those fuckers are ridiculous
2012-09-13T11:44:33  <Kim> it seems you can "see" the whole world and find a path looking by the simple codes?
2012-09-13T11:44:37  <Kim> sample*
2012-09-13T11:44:40  <antimatroid> yep, the challenge is searching through the tree to find which moves to make
2012-09-13T11:44:45  <Kim> ah
2012-09-13T11:45:11  <mcstar> not the whole world
2012-09-13T11:45:15  <mcstar> the whole world in time
2012-09-13T11:45:40  <Kim> the AI challenge we currently are working with Greenfoot - Interlude Greep the greep knows nothing, can only see at its directly location, and has a brain of int 0-255, not allowed to create fields, alot of restricting rules :) quite fun
2012-09-13T11:46:41  <mcstar> i smell java
2012-09-13T11:46:42  <antimatroid> kim here's the basic idea for a game tree: at the root you have the current state of the game, then you add a child for each of your own moves you want to consider, and implement those moves in state for the children nodes, then you do the same from each of those nodes with your opponents, rinse and repeat, once you "run out of time" to construct the tree, you evaluate the terminal nodes and use minimax to pick out which moves to make
2012-09-13T11:46:48  <Kim> What we are working with right now is how to maximixe the use of the int 0-255 brain to contain several things :)
2012-09-13T11:46:53  <mcstar> Kim: is that whole competition based on java?
2012-09-13T11:47:41  <Kim> antimatroid that sounds very CPU intense :D like simulating the best move based on location, enemi location and more
2012-09-13T11:47:47  <antimatroid> with tron you can just do that for basically every move (although you may want to try your hand at maximal path finding once you're separated from your opponent)
2012-09-13T11:48:03  <Kim> mstar yes Greenfoot is a "welcome to java" tool, which bugs me a bit but the contest is fun :)
2012-09-13T11:48:06  <antimatroid> maximal path finding is also a bitch
2012-09-13T11:48:44  <Kim> :)
2012-09-13T11:49:28  <antimatroid> i wonder if anyone used a* in tron
2012-09-13T11:49:38  <mcstar> now i understand the big oracle logo on the bottom of the page
2012-09-13T11:49:39  <antimatroid> to pick which locations to move into with the game tree
2012-09-13T11:49:43  <antimatroid> i'd love to know how that goes
2012-09-13T11:50:19  <mcstar> a* in tron? why?
2012-09-13T11:50:28  <mcstar> did you need more than flood-filling?
2012-09-13T11:50:39  <mcstar> or a* on the game-tree?
2012-09-13T11:50:48  <mcstar> but that is overkill too
2012-09-13T11:51:00  <mcstar> if it'd work at all
2012-09-13T11:51:02  <antimatroid> not really sure how i'd use it
2012-09-13T11:51:15  <antimatroid> but trying to think of how to intelligently eliminate states to consider
2012-09-13T11:51:37  <antimatroid> alpha beta pruning is okay when evaluating a tree
2012-09-13T11:51:50  <antimatroid> but it's not optimal if you plan to continue growing the tree
2012-09-13T11:52:00  <antimatroid> and we recycled part of our tree between turns in tron
2012-09-13T11:52:01  <mcstar> id like to use some machiine learning next time
2012-09-13T11:52:25  <Kim> Which computer education do you two have :)?
2012-09-13T11:52:34  <mcstar> none
2012-09-13T11:52:43  <antimatroid> i did a cs major in undergrad
2012-09-13T11:52:44  <Kim> oh okay :)
2012-09-13T11:52:51  <mcstar> oh, i rogot
2012-09-13T11:52:53  <mcstar> forgot
2012-09-13T11:52:56  <mcstar> his had some
2012-09-13T11:53:00  <mcstar> he had some*
2012-09-13T11:53:14  <mcstar> antimatroid: what cs classes did you have?
2012-09-13T11:53:20  <antimatroid> very crap ones aha
2012-09-13T11:54:02  <antimatroid> first year programming, operating systems, algorithms, adv algorithms, ai, machine learning, computer graphics
2012-09-13T11:54:10  <mcstar> antimatroid: so i guess, that when you learned c++?
2012-09-13T11:54:12  <antimatroid> i did the minimal number of units necessary cause the school sucks at utas
2012-09-13T11:54:19  <antimatroid> i learned c++ in adv. algorithms
2012-09-13T11:54:30  <antimatroid> used java first year and c in algorithms
2012-09-13T11:54:46  <antimatroid> i did a ridiculous number of economics and maths units
2012-09-13T11:54:51  <mcstar> what was the most advanced stuff you learned from machine learning?
2012-09-13T11:55:06  <antimatroid> lol, there was no maths in those classes
2012-09-13T11:55:08  <antimatroid> they were shit
2012-09-13T11:55:19  <mcstar> you dont need more than linalg
2012-09-13T11:55:26  <mcstar> or math at all
2012-09-13T11:55:32  <mcstar> you can go far with ml wo math
2012-09-13T11:55:36  <antimatroid> nah, they didn't even have students learn linear algebra
2012-09-13T11:55:40  <antimatroid> it's a "computing" school
2012-09-13T11:55:53  <mcstar> antimatroid: but what was the most advanced topic?
2012-09-13T11:55:54  <antimatroid> i just got the cs term cause i did a major through the science degree
2012-09-13T11:56:06  <antimatroid> i'll see if i can find the outline
2012-09-13T11:56:27  <mcstar> antimatroid: i just want to compare with Andrew Ng's class

2012-09-13T11:57:51  <mcstar> i was doing it at one time
2012-09-13T11:57:58  <mcstar> and now i dont remember what happened

2012-09-13T11:58:35  <antimatroid> i should go to bed at some point

2012-09-13T13:04:12  <thestinger> unpackaged stuff is packaged now
2012-09-13T13:04:15  <thestinger> nothing big changed
2012-09-13T13:04:21  <thestinger> except fontconfig deprecated all the things
2012-09-13T13:04:45  <mcstar> all i know is, chromium's italic font rendering look bad
2012-09-13T13:04:48  <mcstar> looks*
2012-09-13T13:05:55  <mcstar> it must have looked normal, when i last time used chromium, it was some time ago

2012-09-13T13:06:23  <thestinger> oh, chromium always looks bad
2012-09-13T13:06:25  <thestinger> on every OS
2012-09-13T13:06:26  <mcstar> no
2012-09-13T13:06:28  <thestinger> font-wise
2012-09-13T13:06:30  <mcstar> it was perfect
2012-09-13T13:06:42  <thestinger> it uses an internal fontconfig/freetype2 and their own broken lcd filter
2012-09-13T13:06:50  <mcstar> i had to set up .fonts.conf with infinality
2012-09-13T13:07:00  <mcstar> and that  made fonts look good for all of gtk
2012-09-13T13:07:35  <thestinger> mcstar: it's $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf now btw
2012-09-13T13:07:41  <mcstar> yeah
2012-09-13T13:07:49  <mcstar> i made the change
2012-09-13T13:08:04  <mcstar> and deleted some other confs from /etc/fontssomething
2012-09-13T13:08:27  <mcstar> (and reinstalled it, so it is good now)
2012-09-13T13:08:48  <mcstar> but i just remember now, that chromium's font rendering might not be affected by fontconfig
2012-09-13T13:10:00  <mcstar> thestinger: http://imgur.com/cCXud
2012-09-13T13:10:14  <mcstar> horrible looking italic
2012-09-13T13:11:08  <mcstar> it might be Lucida Grande's and chromium's interaction's artifact
2012-09-13T13:12:10  <thestinger> I don't really use anything in my fonts.conf anymore
2012-09-13T13:12:56  <mcstar> you dont use antialiasing, right?
2012-09-13T13:13:05  <mcstar> you had really slim fonts as i remember
2012-09-13T13:13:15  <thestinger> I do use AA
2012-09-13T13:13:28  <thestinger> it's not a low dpi screen so it looks good
2012-09-13T13:13:43  <thestinger> 1920x1080 at 15 inches (not great, but not nearly as bad as desktop monitors these days)
2012-09-13T13:13:55  <mcstar> oh
2012-09-13T13:13:57  <thestinger> http://ompldr.org/vZmg5Yw looks good here
2012-09-13T13:14:09  <mcstar> i thought youre on the desktop
2012-09-13T13:14:14  <mcstar> since your lappy was broken
2012-09-13T13:14:19  <thestinger> nooo fixed
2012-09-13T13:14:30  <thestinger> I just had to drive to a store and they fixed it right there
2012-09-13T13:14:38  <thestinger> they put a new screen in (covered by warranty)
2012-09-13T13:15:29  <mcstar> thestinger: i dont see any italics on that page
2012-09-13T13:16:00  <thestinger> mcstar: the <? ?> in gvim is italic :P
2012-09-13T13:16:15  <thestinger> well the ? are
2012-09-13T13:16:43  <mcstar> yeah
2012-09-13T13:16:44  <mcstar> thanks
2012-09-13T13:16:45  <thestinger> I had to stop using consolas because it was acting weird though
2012-09-13T13:16:52  <thestinger> :(
2012-09-13T13:17:13  <thestinger> it doesn't ask for enough space above it, so everything aligns strangely
2012-09-13T13:17:13  <mcstar> thestinger: the point was to see chromium's italics, but nice try
2012-09-13T13:17:21  <thestinger> oh

2012-09-13T15:03:37  <thestinger> you have more artistic talent than you think
2012-09-13T15:03:47  <mcstar> i think theres a real resemblance between hilbert and morse
2012-09-13T15:03:52  <mcstar> lol, thanks

2012-09-13T15:09:03  <Migi32> hi. I'm wondering if a starting date for the next contest has been decided yet
2012-09-13T15:09:14  <Migi32> previous contests also started in september, didn't they?
2012-09-13T15:09:35  <mcstar> i dont think so
2012-09-13T15:09:54  <mcstar> ants ended with december, so i think it started somewhen in october
2012-09-13T15:10:01  <mcstar> december 2x?
2012-09-13T15:10:51  <Migi32> planetwars apparently had "programming materials released to the public" in september already
2012-09-13T15:10:53  <mcstar> and no, no dates has been decided so far, if there will be a contest this year, at all
2012-09-13T15:10:55  <Migi32> september 1
2012-09-13T15:11:09  <Migi32> no contest at all? :(
2012-09-13T15:11:19  <mcstar> thats very likely atm
2012-09-13T15:11:24  <Migi32> I thought the last one was rather a success, what changed?
2012-09-13T15:11:25  <mcstar> well see
2012-09-13T15:11:30  <mcstar> nothing
2012-09-13T15:11:34  <mcstar> thats the problem
2012-09-13T15:11:38  <mcstar> nothing has changed
2012-09-13T15:12:09  <mcstar> the servers run on money, in contrast to the popular belief of electricity
2012-09-13T15:12:47  <mcstar> and there are plans to make a non for profit organization so that they will be able to accept donations
2012-09-13T15:13:05  <mcstar> but that stayed in the planning stage for months
2012-09-13T15:13:30  <mcstar> some ppl(well, at least one) should get his act together
2012-09-13T15:13:33  <Migi32> I see
2012-09-13T15:14:22  <Migi32> that's some sad news, I was kind of looking forward to this year's challenge :/
2012-09-13T15:14:43  <mcstar> youre not alone
2012-09-13T15:15:00  <mcstar> i dont mean myself, but there are other asking the same thing a lot lately
2012-09-13T15:15:06  <mcstar> others*
2012-09-13T15:15:26  <mcstar> and it would be wise to ride the wave of the previous success
2012-09-13T15:15:49  <thestinger> Migi32: https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/ :P
2012-09-13T15:16:17  <Migi32> yeah, skipping a year wouldn't be the end but it would make a lot of people forget about the challenge so the next one wouldn't be as big anymore
2012-09-13T15:16:40  <Migi32> thestinger: I have played a fair bit out of that game and SC2 myself, that looks very interesting :P

2012-09-13T18:42:33  <Icebone1000> can someone give me a hand...Im getting FUCKING NUTS with the c# hash stuff
2012-09-13T18:43:46  <Icebone1000> GODAMN, hash/set/table whatever never return true on the Contains() method, and I dont get all that equals and hash stuff, what I have to do to make contains compare stuff by value, simple as that
2012-09-13T18:45:59  <Icebone1000> on the C# starter, everything is derived from location, so it should just compare row and column, but even if the hashset have the damn given location, its returning false on the contain, for the same goddam location
2012-09-13T18:54:25  <Icebone1000> ok, looks like I solve it by commenting out the GetHashCode override on the temLocation subclass, meaning now its the same for both location and team location...tell me if this is ok or will screw me in the future T.T
