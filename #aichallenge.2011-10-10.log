2011-10-10T12:07:35  <mcstar> this guy must have been here when rogue780 sent the message
2011-10-10T12:07:58  <mcstar> amstan: can i ask you a networking related question?
2011-10-10T12:08:02  <amstan> sure
2011-10-10T12:08:17  <mcstar> freenode denied my connection
2011-10-10T12:08:26  <mcstar> it said i have an open proxy on 1080
2011-10-10T12:08:31  <mcstar> which was true
2011-10-10T12:08:58  <mcstar> im tunneling over ssh to another machine, with the D flag, its a small socks based vpn
2011-10-10T12:09:26  <mcstar> so basically, my 1080 port will be used to connect to a "corporate" network
2011-10-10T12:09:34  <amstan> if you're tunelling, why is the port open?
2011-10-10T12:09:36  <mcstar> the thing is: how could freenode know this?
2011-10-10T12:10:02  <mcstar> my command is this: ssh -fNTD1080 remote.machine
2011-10-10T12:10:41  <mcstar> but i was under the impression that port could only be seen from inside my computer
2011-10-10T12:10:56  <mcstar> any ideas?
2011-10-10T12:11:02  <amstan> hold on, portscanning you

2011-10-10T12:11:32  <mcstar> i had to get another dynamic address from the isp to connect here
2011-10-10T12:11:41  <amstan> oh
2011-10-10T12:11:59  <mcstar> freenode banned me for 240minutes
2011-10-10T12:12:02  <amstan> well, the only reason i see freenode denying you is that they did see that port open
2011-10-10T12:12:15  <mcstar> sure, but i dont understand this
2011-10-10T12:12:42  <mcstar> so anyone could connect to my port 1080, and forwarded to the remove closed network?
2011-10-10T12:12:51  <mcstar> remote*
2011-10-10T12:13:13  <amstan> i think freenode is a little more sensitive, even if they didn't get access they'll still complain
2011-10-10T12:13:27  <amstan> can i have the ip of that host?
2011-10-10T12:13:33  <mcstar> no
2011-10-10T12:13:35  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-10T12:13:42  <amstan> ok, do it yourself then
2011-10-10T12:13:49  <amstan> nmap -sT yourip/hostname
2011-10-10T12:13:54  <amstan> it should print all open ports
2011-10-10T12:13:59  <mcstar> i did that
2011-10-10T12:14:05  <amstan> and was it open?
2011-10-10T12:14:13  <mcstar> well, after i closed my ssh
2011-10-10T12:14:27  <mcstar> there was some microsoft something, i think my router opens them up
2011-10-10T12:14:41  <mcstar> i cant access my remote machine right now
2011-10-10T12:14:43  <amstan> 445/tcp  filtered microsoft-ds ?
2011-10-10T12:14:56  <mcstar> yeah, and some other
2011-10-10T12:15:09  <mcstar> im sure i dont use them
2011-10-10T12:15:49  <mcstar> another web portscanning is in progress, so far everything is closed below 540
2011-10-10T12:16:20  <mcstar> 1080 btw is the standard open proxy port
2011-10-10T12:16:55  <mcstar> every open proxy on the net uses it, so maybe freenode only saw that it wasnt closed, or something, and really it is just too sensitive
2011-10-10T12:17:15  <mcstar> but i will study this more, ill try to reproduce the circumstances
2011-10-10T12:17:34  <amstan> well, the reason they denied you is that they think you're using the proxy to connect to their system, maybe to escape bans
2011-10-10T12:17:35  <amstan> it's weird
2011-10-10T12:17:37  <mcstar> i dont want to accidentally open up my computer to the world
2011-10-10T12:17:44  <amstan> just make sure it's not open
2011-10-10T12:18:03  <mcstar> anyway, who is this mcstart?
2011-10-10T12:18:04  <amstan> if you're using ssh to connect to that host, you should at most have the ssh port open

2011-10-10T12:21:20  <mcstar> so its a bit weird
2011-10-10T12:21:31  <mcstar> that after rogue780 makes a typo, this guy shows up
2011-10-10T12:21:38  <amstan> maybe he's trying to profit of the typos of people that want to message you
2011-10-10T12:21:57  <amstan> he will become very rich soon

2011-10-10T12:23:21  <mcstar> :)
2011-10-10T12:23:24  <amstan> i guess he would have to be called mcplanet in that case
2011-10-10T12:23:27  <UncleVasya> He is mcstarTrue :)
2011-10-10T12:23:48  <amstan> mcstar: or you would have to be called mcstop
2011-10-10T12:25:03  <mcstar> im glad everyone had his funny-pills today
2011-10-10T12:25:48  <UncleVasya> amstan: maybe we can put somewhere in problem description or strategy section this hot sentence:    Ants are social insects that work in groups to collectively achieve certain goals that cannot be achieved by a single ant.
2011-10-10T12:26:06  <amstan> UncleVasya: edit the wiki
2011-10-10T12:26:14  <amstan> UncleVasya: the stuff in there eventually reaches the main website
2011-10-10T12:26:29  <amstan> and by eventually i mean automatically
2011-10-10T12:27:57  <UncleVasya> As I have bad connection and old browser it's painful to do things on www.
2011-10-10T12:28:08  <UncleVasya> But this time comes to the end.

2011-10-10T12:30:07  <UncleVasya> In this month I hope.
2011-10-10T12:30:15  <mcstar> UncleVasya: arent you in moscow now?
2011-10-10T12:30:32  <mcstar> maybe you never were, but you attend the university somewhere i guess
2011-10-10T12:30:50  <UncleVasya> no, it is Russia. I'm in Ukraine.
2011-10-10T12:31:08  <mcstar> yeah, but i thought you were going to a russian unversity
2011-10-10T12:31:33  <UncleVasya> You can look for the town Stakhanov.
2011-10-10T12:31:48  <mcstar> maybe its my extrapolation, you told me you had to travel 19 hours oon train to get home
2011-10-10T12:32:17  <UncleVasya> It has a Stakhanov Institute of Pedagogical and Mountain Thechnology.
