2012-02-09T05:09:59  <antimatroid> that one almost seems like it was written by a human
2012-02-09T05:10:49  <thestinger> lol
2012-02-09T05:11:04  <thestinger> I guess they use markov chains
2012-02-09T05:11:10  <thestinger> I should make one :P
2012-02-09T05:11:20  <antimatroid> i'm actually curious
2012-02-09T05:11:22  <antimatroid> human written or not?
2012-02-09T05:11:42  <thestinger> I doubt it
2012-02-09T05:12:05  <antimatroid> i almost want to leave it as a badge of spam honour
2012-02-09T05:12:06  <thestinger> it would have to be really high volume spam for that to pay off (the link at the bottom)
2012-02-09T05:12:34  <thestinger> oh, links on the forum aren't marked nofollow
2012-02-09T05:12:38  <thestinger> so they actually get pagerank for that
2012-02-09T05:12:50  <thestinger> <a href="http://wmv-player.com/" class="postlink">mp4 to mp3 converter</a>
2012-02-09T05:13:08  <thestinger> if it had rel="nofollow" it would take away 99% of their incentive to spam
2012-02-09T05:13:34  <antimatroid> hmm, is that a virus?
2012-02-09T05:13:54  <thestinger> dunno
2012-02-09T05:14:05  <antimatroid> Q: What is WMV Player? 
2012-02-09T05:14:05  <antimatroid> A: It is one of the best and the most wanted video players and helps you play your music files with special codices. It is easy to use and hardly gets into problems. 
2012-02-09T05:14:06  <antimatroid> ahahaha
2012-02-09T05:14:10  <antimatroid> codices
2012-02-09T05:15:20  <thestinger> likely a virus

2012-02-09T08:23:45  <thestinger> easy enough to do the question though, you just have to paste it into a terminal...
2012-02-09T08:24:08  <thestinger> http://bellard.org/jslinux/ works on that, so it's not like they even need to install anything
2012-02-09T08:24:19  <thestinger> still got rid of them

2012-02-09T09:13:47  <delt0r> notch was on the website for a while and in the irc channel every now and then
2012-02-09T09:13:50  <delt0r> its in java
2012-02-09T09:13:51  <mcstar> i just dont know what that is
2012-02-09T09:14:07  <mcstar> so its a game running in the browser?
2012-02-09T09:14:13  <delt0r> and its sold millions of copies
2012-02-09T09:14:31  <delt0r> there is a stand alone client too i think
2012-02-09T09:14:37  <delt0r> i have never played either
2012-02-09T09:14:38  <mcstar> ive seen earlier some you tube video of minecraft with some sheeps
2012-02-09T09:14:42  <mcstar> it was utterly boring
2012-02-09T09:15:00  <delt0r> but is a typical story of someone getting millions with a hobby
2012-02-09T09:15:27  <delt0r> so every 16 yr old that like the game things... screw school, i'll just write a minecraft clone
2012-02-09T09:15:30  <mcstar> so people pay to play that thing
2012-02-09T09:15:52  <delt0r> they don't get the idea that playing games does not give you any skills required to program them
2012-02-09T09:16:07  <mcstar> lol
2012-02-09T09:16:25  <delt0r> yea... people paid alright
2012-02-09T09:16:40  <delt0r> notch is now a millionaire
2012-02-09T09:16:52  <delt0r> that was for beta versions too
2012-02-09T09:17:16  <delt0r> almost 5 million copies sold

2012-02-09T09:27:36  <delt0r> game devs don't think that writing games is stupid...
2012-02-09T09:27:39  <delt0r> as it turns out
2012-02-09T09:29:37  <mcstar> XD
2012-02-09T09:29:44  <mcstar> yes, i dont think so
2012-02-09T09:29:54  <mcstar> it came out a bit too harsh
2012-02-09T09:30:03  <mcstar> i didnt really mean stupid
2012-02-09T09:30:19  <mcstar> but other than making many off of it, it seems a bit pointless
2012-02-09T09:30:44  <mcstar> as i said earlier, i only like FPS games

2012-02-09T11:09:23  <mcstar> and i liked magnets too

2012-02-09T11:10:20  <rwest> minecraft is fun, until you get banned from the server you are playing on for cheating and you lose all you built lol
2012-02-09T11:10:45  <rwest> Not my fault that indy games have exploitable bugs!
2012-02-09T11:11:22  <thestinger> mcstar: minecraft has some neat stuff
2012-02-09T11:11:39  <thestinger> like "redstone", which lets you use logic gates, etc. to build things
2012-02-09T11:11:55  <rwest> you can build entire CPUs with it
2012-02-09T11:12:13  <rwest> or even displays powered by cpus
2012-02-09T11:12:19  <rwest> I have seen some crazy shit
2012-02-09T11:12:21  <thestinger> incredibly boring game though :P
2012-02-09T11:12:36  <thestinger> I'm incapable of playing for more than 4 minutes before getting bored
2012-02-09T11:12:47  <rwest> thestinger: you have no imagination!
2012-02-09T11:12:54  <thestinger> lol
2012-02-09T11:13:07  <rwest> however, I wish it had better liquid physics :-/
2012-02-09T11:13:20  <rwest> I dug a hole through the world to drain the ocean

2012-02-09T11:13:47  <thestinger> you could flood a world with a block of lava :P
2012-02-09T11:13:57  <thestinger> sort of
2012-02-09T11:14:02  <thestinger> but it used to spread the actual source blocks
2012-02-09T11:14:10  <rwest> oh thats even more lame
2012-02-09T11:14:17  <rwest> I want to be able to drain water
2012-02-09T11:14:20  <thestinger> they had sponges to do that
2012-02-09T11:14:24  <rwest> but water has no volume in the game
2012-02-09T11:14:32  <thestinger> sponges no longer do anything
2012-02-09T11:14:36  <rwest> it just has a producer and some rules
2012-02-09T11:14:38  <thestinger> since water isn't infinite :P
