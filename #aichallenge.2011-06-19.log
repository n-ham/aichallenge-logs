2011-06-19T02:37:46  <stocha> anyway my two trys at escaping the ennemy failed miserably
2011-06-19T02:38:21  <stocha> i see to possible reasons : two few ants, the poor thing don't understand the game (neither do i for that matter). Most probably i went the wrong way. I'll try to upload my other way
2011-06-19T02:38:35  <stocha> I think it's good to have the coward bots, and see how they do.
2011-06-19T02:48:55  <Zaphus> stocha:  looking at that game that you claim is bad - you could easily have taken him outby coming around the other side of him as well  - if your bot can't figure it out, all the better for his bot - nothing wrong with that.  If I only had 2 ants left I'd want them to survive as long as possible, dont see why that is 'bad for contest health' - am I meant to suicide ?
2011-06-19T02:50:07  <Zaphus> note, when I say you could easily take him out - remember that I'm just crapping on and havent actually checked to see if it's possible to take him out from the other side - just that there were spaces there you werent using :-)
2011-06-19T02:59:42  <stocha> Zaphus: the bad behavior comes from that all three winning bots are cowards.
2011-06-19T02:59:57  <stocha> so the game will tend to extend as long as it can. Even though it's clearly cut.
2011-06-19T03:00:34  <stocha> the cowardice of stocha bot is not obvious, in that the flee code is a bit broken from two side :p
2011-06-19T03:00:57  <stocha> but it shows when it's afraid of the lonely two remaining ants, when having hordes just at the door :)
2011-06-19T03:02:02  <stocha> i tryed to update it with a litle more obvious cowardice fleeing (although it's not yet the whole army flee stuff)

2011-06-19T03:29:58  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: got rid of handling the 'r' lines and fixed the timer to work on windows

2011-06-19T03:33:18  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: let me check a couple of things with you
2011-06-19T03:33:49  <antimatroid1> in the >> function in state you need to get rid of the 'r' line if statement, in State::reset you need to clear the food vector and in Square::reset you need to make isFood = 0/false
2011-06-19T03:34:54  <Zaphus> antimatroid1: yep, got all that
2011-06-19T03:35:35  <Zaphus> antimatroid1: do you know SQL ?
2011-06-19T03:35:42  <antimatroid1> not a single bit :P
2011-06-19T03:35:45  <Zaphus> lol
2011-06-19T03:36:04  <antimatroid1> i have a very lacking background in cs/programming
2011-06-19T03:36:20  <Zaphus> self-taught?
2011-06-19T03:36:40  <antimatroid1> i technically did a cs major through science degree at utas, but "computing" at utas SUCKS
2011-06-19T03:36:56  <antimatroid1> the only useful class was an advanced algorithms one in the winter
2011-06-19T03:37:03  <antimatroid1> taken once every 2 years
2011-06-19T03:37:24  <antimatroid1> and i did the bare minimum to complete the major :P
2011-06-19T03:37:27  <janzert> antimatroid1: what do you think of ending a game early if one player can reach >95% of squares first for more than say 100 turns, at which point the end game bonus is split between the remaining players?
2011-06-19T03:37:52  <janzert> it would help incentivize bots to make the final kill as quickly as possible
2011-06-19T03:38:03  <antimatroid1> janzert: yeah i'm all for something like that
2011-06-19T03:38:11  <janzert> and end games where a bot has blocked itself into a small area
2011-06-19T03:38:14  <antimatroid1> anything that enables a larger max turns for legitimately long games
2011-06-19T03:38:44  <antimatroid1> larger in the scheme of what's feasible, not necessarily larger than current
2011-06-19T03:39:03  <janzert> I'll have to try and remember to bring it up with mcleopold when I see him next
2011-06-19T03:39:08  <janzert> yeah

2011-06-19T03:39:27  <stocha> i found the C starter bot hard to wrap around my own bot
2011-06-19T03:40:01  <stocha> so much so, that it tryed to rewrite it. Don't forget to flush the stream :p I spent 3 hours trying to figure that hehe
2011-06-19T03:40:53  <stocha> berak pasted a pastebin sample (with no flush) that could probably be a good start if you don't like the current c stater bot also.
2011-06-19T03:40:56  <Zaphus> janzert:  what does "95% of squares first for more than 100 turns" mean ?  is it first, or is it for 100 turns ?
2011-06-19T03:41:04  <stocha> (it is in yesterday log i think)
2011-06-19T03:41:17  <janzert> I was also sort of thinking about a dynamic game limit, say adjust the turn limit once per day such that if 95% of games ended earlier than the current limit it would lower to the limit that number else if >10% of games hit the current limit it would raise the limit (up to whatever we can handle feasibly)
2011-06-19T03:41:25  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: the squares in which you can reach fastest over other bots covers 95% of the grid for 100 consecutive turns
2011-06-19T03:41:38  <janzert> Zaphus: what antimatroid1 said :)
2011-06-19T03:41:57  <Zaphus> antimatroid1: but who determines how fast you "could" get there ?  does that mean the engine does pathfinding for all ants every turn ?

2011-06-19T03:42:27  <janzert> the engine basically does a floodfill from each ant
2011-06-19T03:42:31  <Zaphus> yuk
2011-06-19T03:42:32  <antimatroid1> simple to paint the entire grid in one pass

2011-06-19T03:42:56  <Zaphus> a 'mercy' rule like 100x the number of ants of the other guys is much simpler to undertand
2011-06-19T03:43:34  <Zaphus> *understand
2011-06-19T03:43:56  <janzert> I'd be fine with something like one player has >90% of all ants for 100 turns too
2011-06-19T03:44:20  <Zaphus> has to be a rule that doesnt mean the game ends 20 turns in because one bot was better at food finding !
2011-06-19T03:44:25  <antimatroid1> i think that would be better
2011-06-19T03:44:35  <antimatroid1> easier for people to understand and shortens games that stupidly go for ages
2011-06-19T03:45:04  <Zaphus> the only catch is that your bot has no way of knowing the situation - since it can't tell how many ants are out there, which means you can't react to it
2011-06-19T03:45:15  <Zaphus> but thats a lesser problem
2011-06-19T03:45:19  <janzert> yeah percentage of total ants seems better all around (although maybe not quite as accurate the difference is almost certainly in the noise)
2011-06-19T03:45:40  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: sure, but it encourages you to be attacking if you have a lot of bots
2011-06-19T03:45:45  <antimatroid1> lot of ants*
2011-06-19T03:46:15  <Zaphus> so.. would it split the points after that ?
2011-06-19T03:46:38  <janzert> split the bonus points you mean? yes, that's my thought
2011-06-19T03:46:39  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-06-19T03:46:52  <carlop> I think can be a good thing
2011-06-19T03:46:53  <antimatroid1> otherwise you would just try to have lots of ants without taking out the last few
2011-06-19T03:46:57  <janzert> and is what causes the incentive to finish off the game
2011-06-19T03:47:24  <carlop> better than automatically remove each possible perfect blocking location from the map generator
2011-06-19T03:47:40  <antimatroid1> i still want to do that
2011-06-19T03:47:45  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-06-19T03:47:55  <Zaphus> yeah, I think thats good:   so this game :  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=27933&user=199   would have ended around turn 1151, right ?
2011-06-19T03:47:56  <janzert> ok, I'm pretty convinced to do it so long as McLeopold doesn't raise a large objection
2011-06-19T03:49:15  <Zaphus> whereas this one:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=27927&user=16   would have gone to more or less the same place as it finished
2011-06-19T03:49:16  <janzert> yes
2011-06-19T03:49:36  <Zaphus> should the 100 turn counter reset if a player is eliminated ?  (give you a chance to go after the next one)
2011-06-19T03:49:46  <janzert> although looking at the first one at least, I think 90% may be to low
2011-06-19T03:50:26  <Zaphus> too low ?   600 vs 60 seems a pretty convincing place to be
2011-06-19T03:51:09  <antimatroid1> 100 turns might be too short
2011-06-19T03:51:18  <antimatroid1> give them time to actually wipe them out
2011-06-19T03:51:25  <janzert> it's pretty convincing yes, but not really close to a situation where the 10% are simply huddled in a corner
2011-06-19T03:53:08  <Zaphus> but why is the 'huddle' the problem, surely we're just trying to shorten games that have reached a conclusion ?  or is this a case of creating a rule to prevent a particular type of bot behavior, rather than a general rule for everyone

2011-06-19T03:53:52  <janzert> we want to shorten games the have reached a conclusion *and* incentivize the leading player to finish off the game naturally
2011-06-19T03:54:07  <janzert> we have to make sure the leading player really has that chance
2011-06-19T03:54:14  <antimatroid1> but we're also punishing the leading player to some degree
2011-06-19T03:54:18  <antimatroid1> hence ^^ yeah
2011-06-19T03:54:44  <Zaphus> you're punishing them significantly *if* the game was to otherwise end, but if it's going to play out as a draw then it's the same result but saving CPU :-)
2011-06-19T03:55:04  <Zaphus> or, hand out the points as a percentage (90% of the ants gets 90% of the bonus)
2011-06-19T03:55:42  <Zaphus> actually, thats pretty fair...  and wouldnt hurt the leader
2011-06-19T03:55:53  <janzert> not much incentive to finish off naturally then
2011-06-19T03:56:10  <Zaphus> there isnt anyway, since I'll win regardless
2011-06-19T03:56:22  <janzert> so looking at that first game example I'm thinking maybe 95% and 200 moves?
2011-06-19T03:56:41  <janzert> somewhat less chance you'll win regardless
2011-06-19T03:57:01  <antimatroid1> i guess the question is, what is our realistic kind of max turns?
2011-06-19T03:57:05  <Zaphus> janzert: it would have ended about 50 turns earlier with that rule
2011-06-19T03:57:15  <Zaphus> i.e. turn 1390 or so
2011-06-19T03:57:40  <janzert> yes it still would have ended early
2011-06-19T03:57:58  <janzert> but your bot also wasn't trying to kill it off very hard ;)
2011-06-19T03:58:33  <Zaphus> janzert: no, never claimed it was, but no real incentive to bother either - it would have been happy if the game had been called off 1000 turns ago
2011-06-19T03:58:55  *** carlop <carlop!~chatzilla@2-227-10-134.ip183.fastwebnet.it> has joined #aichallenge
2011-06-19T03:58:59  <Zaphus> (but not 1100 turns ago, then it would have lost!)
2011-06-19T04:00:22  <Zaphus> If you ignore 1st place for now, these rules have a dramatic effect on 2nd place and below, which do change rankings.   blocking is even more valuable if the game will be called off and you get a share of the prize, you'll do better than the bots that died earlier
2011-06-19T04:01:15  <janzert> and I guess I don't really care too much about the specific numbers just so we try and balance so not too many games where the leader is making clear progess ends up triggering it
2011-06-19T04:01:58  <janzert> Zaphus: yep, certainly more incentive to hold on even when you're about gone
2011-06-19T04:03:30  <janzert> antimatroid1: any thought on dynamically adjusting the turn limit as I mentioned above?
2011-06-19T04:04:13  <antimatroid1> which comment?
2011-06-19T04:04:14  <janzert> i.e. once a day look at game lengths and if 95% are lower than current drop to that, if >10% are larger bump it up
2011-06-19T04:04:45  <antimatroid1> yeah something like that could work
2011-06-19T04:04:48  <janzert> with a maximum it can go up to though
2011-06-19T04:05:15  <janzert> basically a hard maximum of whatever we can support with the resources we end up with
2011-06-19T04:05:48  <janzert> it seems like it would help utilize resources with the most efficiency
2011-06-19T04:06:15  <janzert> it also keeps developers from getting settled into a specific length ;)
2011-06-19T04:07:14  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-06-19T04:07:27  <janzert> also I just noticed last night that the game specs specify that values in the pregame are integers :(
2011-06-19T04:07:45  <antimatroid1> you mean the seed thing?
2011-06-19T04:07:53  <janzert> no
2011-06-19T04:08:43  <janzert> rather than saying a value can be any free form string (excluding newlines of course) and then saying what the type is for each one we currently send
2011-06-19T04:09:04  <janzert> that was certainly what I had envisioned at least
2011-06-19T04:09:17  <antimatroid1> do you want to change it to what you think works better?
2011-06-19T04:09:21  <antimatroid1> i don't really mind
2011-06-19T04:09:57  <janzert> the bad thing is at least the D starter bot is already coded for the way the spec is written, I'm not sure how many others are as well
2011-06-19T04:09:58  <antimatroid1> i have an actual graph constructed now for path finding
2011-06-19T04:10:24  <antimatroid1> you mean reads type and value?
2011-06-19T04:10:38  <janzert> yeah, it always converts the value to an integer
2011-06-19T04:10:40  <antimatroid1> i just read type and if it's unknown read the rest of the line to a junk string
2011-06-19T04:10:52  <antimatroid1> problem solved
2011-06-19T04:11:07  <janzert> right, I think that is the way to do it

2011-06-19T04:11:24  <janzert> but the current spec implies that the other is fine
2011-06-19T04:12:00  <antimatroid1> frontier pointed out my code actually makes some kind of sense, i have "getline(is, junk);" :P
2011-06-19T04:12:02  <carlop> a suggestion, for help newby understanding the battle resolution method can be made immage where calculation are made, eg: 1. how many enemy each ant see ?, 2. max (how many enemy each enemy ant see ?) over every ant, 3. declare who should die (num 1 <= num 2)
2011-06-19T04:12:11  <carlop> this for few battle situation
2011-06-19T04:12:12  <janzert> heh
2011-06-19T04:13:01  <carlop> I think this step to step calculation can help
2011-06-19T04:13:10  <antimatroid1> carlop: it's not how many enemy ants they see, it's how many enemy ants are within the attack radius
2011-06-19T04:13:32  <janzert> number of ants within reach ;)
2011-06-19T04:13:37  <carlop> yes, change "see" to "inside attack radius"
2011-06-19T04:13:52  <antimatroid1> janzert: ?
2011-06-19T04:14:02  <antimatroid1> i seem to be a terrible judge of helping people understand

2011-06-19T04:14:22  <janzert> the attack radius is how for the ant can reach or maybe kick :)
2011-06-19T04:14:45  <janzert> the food spawn radius is how far the ant can do fine work with it's pincers
2011-06-19T04:15:04  <janzert> takes a lot of small intricate work to get another ant out of food
2011-06-19T04:15:19  <janzert> can punch and kick further of course
2011-06-19T04:15:23  <janzert> and see even further
2011-06-19T04:15:32  <antimatroid1> story time :)
2011-06-19T04:15:54  <antimatroid1> janzert: what about spit venom or whatever
2011-06-19T04:15:58  <antimatroid1> poison ants
2011-06-19T04:16:09  <janzert> you only spit one direction though
2011-06-19T04:16:19  <antimatroid1> maybe they're canadian ants?
2011-06-19T04:16:24  <janzert> :)
2011-06-19T04:17:07  <antimatroid1> i wish amstan was here
2011-06-19T04:18:26  <Zaphus> janzert: was AFK.    I'm not a fan of dynamic game lengths.  especially since it could cause them to go up and then you'd bring in another rule to stop them going up further, and then a rule to try to bring them back down.
2011-06-19T04:19:14  <janzert> there'd be a limit on how high it can go
2011-06-19T04:19:41  <janzert> which is basically what we would set the turn limit too if we don't use a dynamic limit
2011-06-19T04:20:08  <Zaphus> why not make a simpler rule that can always be watched, like the 90% one, or the one about how much of the map you control - those I can understand and predict, a dynamic limit means the same match on day 1 ends on a different turn to on day 2, even if everything plays out the same
2011-06-19T04:20:08  <janzert> and also where we would start it
2011-06-19T04:20:43  <janzert> it would be in addition to the early end rule
2011-06-19T04:21:32  <janzert> it allows for better resource usage while only cutting off the 5% of games that would go longer
2011-06-19T04:22:36  <janzert> also I like the idea that it makes sure the bots are used to working with a variable turn limit
2011-06-19T04:23:13  <janzert> we've certainly seen that anything that stays the same people will assume that it will stay the same, even if we say that it won't
2011-06-19T04:24:02  <Zaphus> seems to be making things complicated when it doesnt need to.   I dont mind variable turn lengths between 500 and 1000 turns (or whatever) - but dynamic per day isnt the same thing, it's a set length that slowly moves
2011-06-19T04:24:43  <janzert> we could update it after each game ;)
2011-06-19T04:24:47  <carlop> maybe better is having different game lenght on different map (or number of player)
2011-06-19T04:24:59  <Zaphus> but why ?  it's just adding complexity where it isnt needed
2011-06-19T04:25:19  <janzert> the need for it is to maximize resource efficiency
2011-06-19T04:25:26  <janzert> it's a meta need
2011-06-19T04:25:26  <carlop> and janzert rule or similar can set what's the "optimal" lenght for each map
2011-06-19T04:26:06  <janzert> carlop: hmm, doing the calculation per map might work really well
2011-06-19T04:26:37  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: it would be fixed for the final contest
2011-06-19T04:26:43  <antimatroid1> and all rankings are reset when that starts
2011-06-19T04:26:50  <Zaphus> so it's not about letting the games play out, or stopping blocking or coward bots then, its just about resources ?    in which case make it wall-clock time as the limit, not turns
2011-06-19T04:27:27  <Zaphus> which will hurt the smart bots more, and I'm guessing you're going to say thats unfair :-)
2011-06-19T04:28:12  <Zaphus> or go the chess-clock route, each bot gets 2 minutes of wall clock for the entire game, on top of the per-turn limit :)
2011-06-19T04:28:13  <janzert> not so much unfair as contrary to a primary goal
2011-06-19T04:28:14  <carlop> or a cowar bot can waste all his cpu time before to say "don't move"
2011-06-19T04:28:37  <janzert> more complex time controls were very seriously considered
2011-06-19T04:28:46  <Zaphus> (I'm playing devils advocate here by the way, someone needs to)
2011-06-19T04:28:57  <janzert> and maybe we will for the next contest
2011-06-19T04:29:27  <Zaphus> so the primary goal is what ?   to let the matches reach a conclusion ?
2011-06-19T04:30:06  <antimatroid1> to efficiently use the resources available to rank the bots, with the primary goal of the contest being to have interesting ai?
2011-06-19T04:30:14  <antimatroid1> "ai"*
2011-06-19T04:30:31  <janzert> the primary goal I was refering to about not hurting smart bots was "encourage the development of the smartest program possible"
2011-06-19T04:30:34  <Zaphus> right now, a 10-bot match between slow bots (that use all their CPU) and a 2000 turn limit will take up to 5.5 CPU hours, which is a long long time
2011-06-19T04:30:45  <janzert> i.e. Artificial Intelligence contest
2011-06-19T04:31:01  <antimatroid1> yes, and that's too longf
2011-06-19T04:31:22  <Zaphus> actually, I think that was at 1 second per move, I did the calculation a while ago, but you get the idea
2011-06-19T04:31:23  <janzert> right, I don't think there is anyway we'll be able to use 2000 turns
2011-06-19T04:32:10  <Zaphus> so, why not set it at 1000 then ?  half the cost.
2011-06-19T04:32:38  <janzert> I'm not even completely sure 1000 will be feasible ;)
2011-06-19T04:32:55  <janzert> although too much below that and something else is going to have to give
2011-06-19T04:33:01  <Zaphus> now you're getting to the root of the problem....   500 turns isnt enough to determine the winner in a strong match
2011-06-19T04:33:21  <janzert> are you sure?
2011-06-19T04:33:40  <janzert> a good number of strong matches seem to end around 300 or so
2011-06-19T04:34:14  <janzert> I'm not really not sure one way or the other
2011-06-19T04:34:23  <janzert> s/not really/really
2011-06-19T04:34:32  <Zaphus> true, but those arent the ones people will complain about :-)
2011-06-19T04:35:12  <Zaphus> with a map of 100x100, it takes 200 turns to walk the full length diagonal - so 300 turns would *seem* to be barely enough
2011-06-19T04:35:14  <janzert> if 98% of the strong matches are naturally decided I'll be quite happy

2011-06-19T04:35:31  <stocha> it seems this version will chain produce those silly games : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=27976&user=107
2011-06-19T04:36:20  <janzert> Zaphus: yes, it's not hard to find examples that aren't decided by 500
2011-06-19T04:36:32  <janzert> I'd really like to see a histogram though
2011-06-19T04:37:07  <Zaphus> janzert: agreed... on the other hand, it's a Beta server - set it to 500 turns for a couple of days and see what happens
2011-06-19T04:37:24  <Zaphus> I've got the SQL dump from a few days ago, but can't work out how to find the game results
2011-06-19T04:37:37  <janzert> actually if that game had ended at 500 I'm not sure the order would have changed (maybe 2nd and 3rd would swap)
2011-06-19T04:39:03  <antimatroid1> who are the people who want to keep the possibility of block off regions?
2011-06-19T04:39:19  <antimatroid1> i am pretty keen to paint maps with 3x3 blocks to eliminate such possibilities
2011-06-19T04:39:38  <antimatroid1> carlop: ^?
2011-06-19T04:39:43  <Zaphus> here's why you don't want to decide at 500:   http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=27968&user=133    my blocktest would have won :-)
2011-06-19T04:39:47  <janzert> I don't really care if small regions can be blocked off
2011-06-19T04:40:03  <janzert> and it may provide 'prettier' or more natural looking maps
2011-06-19T04:40:13  <antimatroid1> janzert: it's a pretty cheap way of preventing someone from getting the food bonus
2011-06-19T04:40:19  <Zaphus> I like blocking off, I see no problem.   if water was kept "thin" it would be harder to do as well
2011-06-19T04:40:47  <antimatroid1> Zaphus: i found carving land out of water much faster than the reverse
2011-06-19T04:40:59  <antimatroid1> while checking the map was connected etc.
2011-06-19T04:41:12  <Zaphus> yeah, more like maze generation that way
2011-06-19T04:42:21  <stocha> yeah we may need to take the map size into account.
2011-06-19T04:42:32  <stocha> for a 32x32 map, 2000 seems a bit too much :p
2011-06-19T04:42:40  <stocha> although for 256x256 it might be okay.
2011-06-19T04:43:48  <Zaphus> hmm - looking at my blocktest, I think that shorter games will favor blocking, since it takes a while to remove a block (one that is half-hearted but still a little effective) - you need to pick away at the block one or two per turn, takes time
2011-06-19T04:43:48  <stocha> antimatroid1: don't take out blockng. At least until the beta illustrate why you should. it didn't happen yet.
2011-06-19T04:44:02  <stocha> especially if it means hard map generation rule to avoid it.
2011-06-19T04:44:38  <antimatroid1> stocha: i would just be carving the maps with 3x3 blocks
2011-06-19T04:44:45  <stocha> Zaphus: how does your blocks endure against the top 5 bots ?
2011-06-19T04:44:52  <antimatroid1> i am going to at least test carving with nxn blocks next week
2011-06-19T04:45:06  <stocha> antimatroid1: yeah. it would just be another constraint on map generation. Wich is problematic enough without any constraints

2011-06-19T04:45:57  <Zaphus> actually ignore that, there was nowhere to block so it just played an average game instead
2011-06-19T04:46:49  <Zaphus> my blocker doesnt start blocking until turn 200, and against a top bot it doesnt tend to live that long :-)
2011-06-19T04:48:16  <Zaphus> it also doesnt actually block, it just makes diagonal walls, but those have blocking properties that need to be dealt with so it kills dumb bots

2011-06-19T05:17:50  <carlop> antimatroid1: for design map against blocking wiht 3x3 block don't know, maybe could be a good thing have small corridor that can be blocked, giving to one side positional advantage (eg. if you fight hard for conquer certain part of the map, you can easily defend), the only problem that i can see is if perfect blocking can be possible from all side
2011-06-19T05:19:10  <janzert> mleise: just a heads up and not sure if it's something with my setup, but the visualizer in firefox 5 for me has dark grey squares over the enabled buttons
2011-06-19T05:19:44  <mleise> janzert: firefox 5, if it exists must be alpha or beta software
2011-06-19T05:20:21  <janzert> official release is monday, final binaries are already on ftp
2011-06-19T05:20:34  <janzert> barring any last minute emergencies of course
2011-06-19T05:21:16  <janzert> err, official release is 21st, Tuesday
2011-06-19T05:22:55  <janzert> if you do want to check it out early, you can find it at ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/5.0/
2011-06-19T05:24:10  <mleise> janzert: let me take a look at what my fellow Gentoo repository ppl say about its stability. :p
2011-06-19T05:24:55  <mleise> cause my current repo snapshot still has ff 4 marked as experimental
2011-06-19T05:25:16  <janzert> :)
2011-06-19T05:25:35  <janzert> it's certainly not a big update over FF4
2011-06-19T05:25:42  <mleise> they jumped really quick from 4 to 5, i don't know why. there cant me many new features
2011-06-19T05:26:11  <janzert> they're switching to chrome style releases
2011-06-19T05:26:26  <mleise> but probably a lot of bugs, due to the rush, like with my perfectly bug free visualizer that even runs on IE 9, hehe :-(
2011-06-19T05:26:27  <janzert> timed, 4 times a year no matter what is in
2011-06-19T05:26:59  <mleise> so by 2020 they have version 40?
2011-06-19T05:27:18  <janzert> by next year you're not suppose to be paying attention to the version number ;)
2011-06-19T05:27:29  <janzert> and we have chrome 12? now
2011-06-19T05:28:39  <mleise> yeah right, but it is chrome 13.0.124.0 ... so you look at it differently
2011-06-19T05:29:42  <janzert> once we go through a few cycles of the FF number bumping every 3 months I'm sure people won't be paying attention to it either
2011-06-19T05:29:45  <mleise> oh actually Gentoo has revoked the stable tag from Chromium 13 and I would downgrade to 12 if I updated my system now

2011-06-19T05:30:38  <mleise> my mother used ff 4 on windows and it was eating to much of her 1 GB ram, i told her to use Opera. They were writing browsers for handhelds for years
2011-06-19T05:31:00  <janzert> :)
2011-06-19T05:31:14  <janzert> they've had a good history of low memory use for sure
2011-06-19T05:32:00  <mleise> although they switch paradigm now to compete with the other browsers. at least with javascript precompilation.

2011-06-19T05:40:03  <mleise> janzert: It is an FF5 bug. Look at http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/shadows/various.html
2011-06-19T05:40:35  <mleise> Scroll down to 'Image'. In other browsers you see dice with a blue shadow. In FF5 the whole image is blurred.
2011-06-19T05:40:40  <mleise> or rather... blue
2011-06-19T05:40:44  * janzert nods
2011-06-19T05:40:56  <janzert> ugh :(
2011-06-19T05:41:43  * antimatroid doesn't understand why they don't standardise crap so web development isn't such a pita?
2011-06-19T05:42:17  <janzert> the problem here isn't standardization so much as implementation
2011-06-19T05:43:04  <mcstar> html5 is complete due to 2022
2011-06-19T05:46:51  <mleise> There is a hole in the standard: For the buttons I use one big image and render only parts of it. Most browsers add the shadow after things are drawn on screen so that 'cut out' strategy works.

2011-06-19T05:47:36  <mleise> The standard isn't clear here.
2011-06-19T05:49:46  <mcstar> cant ou disable shadow? and then add a full transparent image on top of it, which has shadow

2011-06-19T05:54:22  <stocha> at last a game, that a bot clearly loose because of the scoring system : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=27994&user=107
2011-06-19T05:55:06  <stocha> (stocha escaper code, it end up two in order of elimination but 4 on score :)   It outlives bots for hundreds of turn without earning a point :)  )
2011-06-19T05:56:00  <stocha> turn 200 : only two player left A and B. after 650 turn, B end up in 4th position :p
2011-06-19T05:56:18  <stocha> so the scoring system worked in that particular case.
2011-06-19T05:56:21  <mleise> mcstar: I wont work around a regression bug in a browser that hasn't been released yet.

2011-06-19T06:23:48  <antimatroid> smiley1983: :)
2011-06-19T06:23:56  <antimatroid> it's pretty simple to add in the end
2011-06-19T06:27:42  <smiley1983> did you end up going with vector<vector<GNode> > grid or map<Location, GNode*> grid*** or some other option? or is it secret? :)
2011-06-19T06:29:04  <smiley1983> ah, I think you already answered that, just catching up with the log now
2011-06-19T06:29:27  <antimatroid> i made GNode my normal Square struct
2011-06-19T06:29:36  <antimatroid> and Grid has vector<vector<Square> >
2011-06-19T06:29:55  <antimatroid> and the squares have a vector<Locations> neighbours
2011-06-19T06:30:29  <antimatroid> they also have a vector<char> nDirections
2011-06-19T06:30:33  <antimatroid> couldn't avoid that
2011-06-19T06:30:51  <antimatroid> well atm it's vector<int>, but i'm going to change that soon
2011-06-19T06:31:55  <smiley1983> yes, that makes sense, precalculating the neighbors to avoid all that repetition of wrapping functions :)
2011-06-19T06:32:06  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-19T06:32:11  <antimatroid> and not looking on water squares
2011-06-19T06:32:19  <smiley1983> yes, indeed
2011-06-19T06:32:22  <antimatroid> can just ignore the existence of water when pathfinding etc.
2011-06-19T06:32:51  <antimatroid> someone before said it was redundant, i think it'll be worthwhile
2011-06-19T06:34:34  <smiley1983> I don't really know the relative costs of looking up a value in a larger table vs recalculating that stuff, but I would have thought it would save some cycles in later turns
2011-06-19T06:35:05  <smiley1983> plus you can do all the allocation and calculation in the first turn, and then update it as as you find water
2011-06-19T06:35:52  <antimatroid> exactly
2011-06-19T06:36:21  <smiley1983> I think the occupied battle system is clear enough, especially with the code provided to explain
2011-06-19T06:36:34  <smiley1983> has it been verified that it solves the blocking issue?
2011-06-19T06:38:05  <antimatroid> mcleopold has some tester that he ran on it

2011-06-19T06:38:15  <antimatroid> it's certainly much better

2011-06-19T06:41:12  <mleise> but the guy who rewrote the canvas code will suffer next week *evilgrin*
2011-06-19T06:41:19  <janzert> oh really

2011-06-19T06:41:49  <mleise> oh someone says 'toggle shadow off', then it is the same bug of course
2011-06-19T06:42:04  <janzert> yes, that's what made me think it was
2011-06-19T06:42:29  <mleise> "Remove unnecessary full context save/restore" <- so much for 'unnecessary', lol
2011-06-19T06:42:56  <janzert> it's fixed in next version already so it'll only be broken for the next 3 months ;)
2011-06-19T06:43:39  <janzert> lines up quite nicely with our run time
2011-06-19T06:43:53  <mleise> they did not release this version yet. I'm sure regressions will cause the release to be held back
2011-06-19T06:44:08  <janzert> I actually really doubt it at this point
2011-06-19T06:45:06  <janzert> they're are too close with final binaries cut already, I'm guessing only a major security vulnerability will stop it at this point

2011-06-19T06:58:16  <stocha> a case of a dumb leading bot lemminging out it's ant to death : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28001&user=206
2011-06-19T06:58:47  <stocha> (from turn 339 on)
2011-06-19T06:59:26  <stocha> this a clear case of congestion trouble also :p
2011-06-19T07:00:39  <stocha> interestingly, even with a 20:1 death ratio in it's favor, the bot still fail to grab the second place :p
2011-06-19T07:01:29  <stocha> so this is another case of the scoring system actually working.
2011-06-19T07:05:05  <stocha> there doesn't seems to be many games that involves many of the top ranked bots. That would be important though.
2011-06-19T07:05:30  <stocha> Show me a game, with the top 4 bot participating ;..
2011-06-19T07:05:50  <_flag> I haven't played a game for at least four hours
2011-06-19T07:08:15  <stocha> the problem with adding some weak bot to a 6 player game involving two (or three) of the best bots, is that it will imply a lot of noise. Especially if it is always the case.
2011-06-19T07:08:30  <stocha> _flag: so you think the pairing is broken anyway ?
2011-06-19T07:09:21  <_flag> Well apparently there's a bug in it that has yet to be fixed and this is a known issue

2011-06-19T07:54:37  <antimatroid> Zaphus: have you considered making a graph?
2011-06-19T07:56:36  <Zaphus> what kind of graph
2011-06-19T07:59:37  <Zaphus> I can't believe my bot didnt time out in this match:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28036&user=78    then again, I wish it had killed my blocktest too :-)
2011-06-19T07:59:55  <carlop> antimatroid: at the beginning I was skeptikal, but graph is a good idea (and looking at my bot is almost a graph, with Location+distance stored in a precalculated table)
2011-06-19T08:00:23  <antimatroid> Zaphus: add vector<Location> neighbours to square
2011-06-19T08:00:29  <antimatroid> then remove neighbours with water information
2011-06-19T08:00:37  <antimatroid> save time on pathfinding etc.
2011-06-19T08:00:57  <antimatroid> you can use the start up time to make the neighbour vectors
2011-06-19T08:01:51  <Zaphus> interesting, so 4 'connectors' per location, minus the water...  does it really gain you much ?
2011-06-19T08:02:19  <antimatroid> i haven't done speed tests
2011-06-19T08:02:30  <antimatroid> but think about it, you don't have to call getLocation 4 times for every search square
2011-06-19T08:02:41  <antimatroid> you already have <=4 locations to iterate through
2011-06-19T08:03:35  <Zaphus> yeah, guess that would be faster if thats where the bottleneck is.   if you want a good speedup, replace distance() with distance2()  and remove the sqrt   (for the c++ bot anyway)
2011-06-19T08:03:47  <antimatroid> did that long ago :P
2011-06-19T08:04:05  <antimatroid> we decided to keep euclidean officially because the distances make more sense

2011-06-19T08:05:07  <Zaphus> I end up with over 4000 ants (I think, the browser breaks) in this match:  http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28036&user=78    that means I'm sending out a move in less than 0.1ms per ant and not timing out :-)
2011-06-19T08:07:49  <Zaphus> wow, I've played 4 games with the latest version of my bot - all 4 have involved UncleVasya
2011-06-19T08:11:02  <Zaphus> I had 5859 ants at then end of that game, out of only 9500 squares on the map :-)
2011-06-19T08:11:18  <antimatroid> finish them? :P
2011-06-19T08:11:30  <Zaphus> nope, total chicken, didnt even try
2011-06-19T08:12:02  <Zaphus> could have ended the game a long time earlier... wish I could rip a frame from the replay and feed it to my bot to debug !
2011-06-19T08:12:30  <Zaphus> even if it just saved out as a map, such that you start with a crapload of ants (can you do that ?)
2011-06-19T08:12:37  <antimatroid> Zaphus: try adding in a thing saying if you have like x condition then just bomb the hell out of your enemy?
2011-06-19T08:13:00  <antimatroid> like number of ants > 0.25 number of squares or whatever
2011-06-19T08:13:10  <Zaphus> antimatroid: I did, which is why I want to debug :-)
2011-06-19T08:13:17  <antimatroid> ah, okay :P
2011-06-19T08:15:17  <Zaphus> ah, I think I found the line of code that "might" be the cause:
2011-06-19T08:15:21  <Zaphus> agressive=false;
2011-06-19T08:15:37  <Zaphus> more g's in aggressive, but you get the idea
2011-06-19T08:16:14  <antimatroid> i have found using "true/false" is slower than "1/0" in c++
2011-06-19T08:16:21  <antimatroid> annoying, but i use what's faster
2011-06-19T08:17:06  <antimatroid> i would have expected the compiler to make them the same thing :\
2011-06-19T08:17:24  <Zaphus> what compiler are you using ?
2011-06-19T08:17:32  <antimatroid> would have done that with mingw
2011-06-19T08:17:43  <antimatroid> i'm just using gcc or whatever on ubuntu now
2011-06-19T08:18:17  <Zaphus> pretty pathetic compiler if it can't do true/false as 1/0
2011-06-19T08:18:25  <Zaphus> or at least <nonzero> / 0
2011-06-19T08:18:29  <antimatroid> mingw is wonderful for most things
2011-06-19T08:21:26  <antimatroid> has anyone done anything about marking when squares are going to be used and using that information while path finding?
2011-06-19T08:21:47  <Zaphus> going to be used for what ?
2011-06-19T08:22:26  <antimatroid> like say you collect food with an ant, you have a path mapped out where each square is going to be "used" at some point in the future, you can't move onto the same square with another ant on the same turn with another path
2011-06-19T08:23:39  <Zaphus> no, but I calculate my ants one at a time, so once I "move" the one the next one knows where it now is and pathfinds around it.      smarter ordering would be good
2011-06-19T08:24:07  <antimatroid> something like set<pair<int, Location> > would allow you to store the int turn a location is already used

2011-06-19T08:33:23  <carlop> i'm testing few solution, don't know if one can just choose a greedy ordering (eg. first path for the nearest ant-food pair, second priority path for second nearest ant-food pair, ...)
2011-06-19T08:34:13  <carlop> the other possibility is found for each ant 4-5 possible path, then try to assign to each ant a path such that they maximize the cumulative result

2011-06-19T09:00:40  <berak> put some 200 symmetric ones in (symmetric_mapgen.py)
2011-06-19T09:01:01  <berak> yeah, f*ckd up while logging in
2011-06-19T09:01:58  <stocha> Map is an important aspect of the rule set.
2011-06-19T09:02:25  <stocha> So if people want to test seriously, they will want to optimize for a map distribution as close to the real on as possible.
2011-06-19T09:02:42  <stocha> Especially if some really devil map / map-patterns finaly shows up.
2011-06-19T09:02:52  <stocha> (which i doubt, but well)
2011-06-19T09:03:10  <stocha> For example, i'm yet to see a 100% open map on the test server.
2011-06-19T09:03:13  <berak> true. sadly the repo comes only with 20 each
2011-06-19T09:03:25  <Zaphus> yeah, I want to see the full open map too
2011-06-19T09:03:27  <stocha> if there had, ranking could switch
2011-06-19T09:03:40  <stocha> then there are few map with lot's of ant.
2011-06-19T09:03:53  <stocha> i never see my ref bot controling hordes of ants.
2011-06-19T09:04:06  <stocha> i don't think i saw really big map also.
2011-06-19T09:04:13  <stocha> etc ...
2011-06-19T09:04:41  <stocha> from my early testing, i concluded that map/(and food spawning) was a very important aspect of the rule set.
2011-06-19T09:05:05  <stocha> It would be like trying to make a strong bot for whatever fighting rule would be arbitrarily decided at the end.
2011-06-19T09:05:13  <stocha> you can do stuff, but you can't optimize much

2011-06-19T09:09:05  <stocha> i'd like to see what i call unreasonable maps :p
2011-06-19T09:09:19  <stocha> 256x256 with 20% food at start, and 4 food per turn.
2011-06-19T09:10:02  <stocha> (256x256 was proposed as upper bound for maps size)
2011-06-19T09:12:03  <stocha> we need maps that would encourage congestion management. (traffic jam management)
2011-06-19T09:12:32  <stocha> at this point no map on the test server would justify even to think about the subject.
2011-06-19T09:16:56  <stocha> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28013&user=107   What about this behavior to be elected test-server best freaky bot ? :p
2011-06-19T09:17:09  <stocha> (you need to watch it at 6 or 7 speed obviously)
2011-06-19T09:19:40  <stocha> it's kinda frustrating that games that are fun to watch means the underlying bots are weak :'(

2011-06-19T09:24:37  <Rabidus> does someone have that tcp server up and running?
2011-06-19T09:25:06  <stocha> berak proposed some experimental code for a tcp server a few minutes ago.
2011-06-19T09:25:15  <Rabidus> yeah i saw
2011-06-19T09:25:26  <stocha> so, the answer would be no then.
2011-06-19T09:25:32  <Rabidus> ok

2011-06-19T09:29:46  <berak> well, i'm blockkkked by this NAT router (usb wireless modem), but most ppl with adsl or a real cable plugged into their machine should be able to accept inbound connections
2011-06-19T09:30:16  <Rabidus> i can run a tcp server
2011-06-19T09:31:11  <stocha> interesting
2011-06-19T09:31:23  <stocha> i can provide a freely available reference bot :p

2011-06-19T09:32:43  <stocha> the problem is most people want to keep their code secret.

2011-06-19T09:35:08  <antimatroid> 21-40 are new, 31-40 are smaller
2011-06-19T09:35:24  <stocha> where are the 256x256 maps ?
2011-06-19T09:35:52  <stocha> they need to be tryed during beta, so we know the what the reasonable max size is.
2011-06-19T09:36:55  <antimatroid> stocha: no way maps are increasing in size
2011-06-19T09:36:57  <antimatroid> it's not feasible
2011-06-19T09:37:13  <stocha> what make it not feseable ?
2011-06-19T09:37:20  <stocha> and what is the current size cap ?
2011-06-19T09:37:29  <antimatroid> the required number of turns for it to reasonably play out for a reasonable max turns
2011-06-19T09:37:37  <antimatroid> and the number of games needed to rank bots in the final contest
2011-06-19T09:37:46  <antimatroid> and the amount of money we're likely to have
2011-06-19T09:37:51  <antimatroid> it's just not going to happen
2011-06-19T09:37:54  <stocha> 2000 enables to play out most 256x256 maps, but the most twisted
2011-06-19T09:38:01  <antimatroid> 2000 is too long
2011-06-19T09:38:12  <berak> 2000 is to long
2011-06-19T09:38:15  <stocha> yeah. but you need to try them during beta, that's all i say.
2011-06-19T09:38:40  <stocha> maybe 1 sec is too long for this game. Although from bot perspective it seems quite short :p`
2011-06-19T09:39:01  <stocha> let's make it 0.1 second per move, but with the ability to keep some time for hard to make moves.
2011-06-19T09:39:05  <stocha> (like in chess)
2011-06-19T09:39:28  <berak> how would you determine that ?
2011-06-19T09:39:40  <stocha> determine what ?
2011-06-19T09:39:45  <berak> situation being different for each player
2011-06-19T09:39:47  <antimatroid> lol
2011-06-19T09:39:50  <antimatroid> 0.1 seconds
2011-06-19T09:40:07  <stocha> let's say you have to make 10 moves per second, instead of only one.
2011-06-19T09:40:13  <antimatroid> say good bye to any interesting strategies
2011-06-19T09:40:19  <stocha> or 20 moves every two seconds.
2011-06-19T09:40:49  <stocha> 1 sec is not enough for interesting strategies
2011-06-19T09:41:05  <Rabidus> well 1 minute is not enough for intresting strategies
2011-06-19T09:41:07  <stocha> and time is crucial for the contest health. So more flexible time setting might be good.
2011-06-19T09:41:27  <stocha> 1 hours per move would be confortable i think.
2011-06-19T09:41:38  <Rabidus> one week games

2011-06-19T09:42:03  <stocha> or maybe 24 moves over 24 hours rather. So you have a litle bit of flexibility
2011-06-19T09:42:36  <Rabidus> btw. i have that tcp server running
2011-06-19T09:42:44  <antimatroid> link?
2011-06-19T09:42:44  <berak> that would be like internet chess
2011-06-19T09:42:47  <stocha> Of course with 4096x4096  maps, time management will still play a crucial role. And you 'll have to use your 4 terabyte of memory wisely.
2011-06-19T09:42:48  <Rabidus> so some testing is appreciated

2011-06-19T10:34:02  <antimatroid> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/priority_queue/ that page makes it sound like it orders it with less by default
2011-06-19T10:34:13  <antimatroid> but i swear it orders it be greater by default :\
2011-06-19T10:35:09  <antimatroid> no it is
2011-06-19T10:35:17  <antimatroid> i have less/greater around the wrong way for some reason
2011-06-19T10:37:20  <carlop> this example: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/priority_queue/top/ seem clarify that .top() return the greatest element
2011-06-19T10:38:05  <carlop> but I think priority queue on your class need that < is definited
2011-06-19T10:38:14  <antimatroid> carlop: but if you define it as "priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> >" then it will return top() as the smallest value
2011-06-19T10:38:19  <antimatroid> and vice versa for less<int>
2011-06-19T10:38:26  <antimatroid> which seems counterintuitive to me? :s

2011-06-19T10:40:05  <antimatroid> carlop: doesn't that seem counterintuitive the way greater and less work?
2011-06-19T10:41:37  <antimatroid> priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > t, t.top() returns the least element in the queue
2011-06-19T10:41:37  <antimatroid> priority_queue<int, vector<int>, less<int> > t, t.top() returns the greatest element in the queue
2011-06-19T10:42:07  <carlop> i usualy use set for extract minimal / maximal elemene, stack for LIFO and queue for FIFO
2011-06-19T10:43:03  <antimatroid> yes i need a priority_queue of FoodSearch structs that orders them with the < operator and spits out the smallest valued one first :P
2011-06-19T10:43:28  <antimatroid> i think i want priority_queue<FoodSearch, vector<FoodSearch>, greater<FoodSearch> > but that seems counterintuitive :P
2011-06-19T10:44:54  <carlop> you can use set, can still insert element / erase element fast, and extract the minimal element with *SET.begin()
2011-06-19T10:45:50  <antimatroid> true
2011-06-19T10:45:53  <carlop> or priority_queue with greater, yes
2011-06-19T10:46:00  <antimatroid> is either faster?
2011-06-19T10:46:02  <carlop> a bit counterintuitive
2011-06-19T10:47:04  <carlop> don't know, set i think depend on the order you do the operation
2011-06-19T10:47:11  <antimatroid> i'm surprised the underlying container is usually a vector
2011-06-19T10:47:24  <antimatroid> i would have expected it to be a set
2011-06-19T10:47:29  <antimatroid> or something like it
2011-06-19T10:47:54  <antimatroid> would priority_queue<int, set<int>, greater<int> > basically be the same as just using a set?
2011-06-19T10:48:05  <carlop> sorry, maybe set is faster, but depend a lot on how many operation you need do to (how many push, how many .top, etc)
2011-06-19T10:48:26  <antimatroid> it's a search queue for a*
2011-06-19T10:49:54  <berak> the shocking thing with trueskill is: it never looks at the scores, only at the ranking from a game. so it makes no difference, if you won a game in 20000 turns with a meager 5 ants(all your opponents botched), or in 50 turns (ate all of them in record time)
2011-06-19T10:51:05  <jbroman> berak: It's amazing how simple it is. It's especially cool that in team-based multiplayer, it does not matter which players on the team contributed the most: if your team wins, you win. (This discourages behaviours in which one player tries to maximize his score at the expense of his team.)
2011-06-19T10:51:30  <antimatroid> berak: we've had a similar thing previously
2011-06-19T10:51:33  <antimatroid> (i think
2011-06-19T10:51:36  <berak> hmm teams..
2011-06-19T10:53:02  <berak> you mean discussion about rankings, here ?
2011-06-19T10:54:17  <berak> and any lisp user will hate you for not closing that bracket
2011-06-19T10:54:19  <jbroman> berak: I mean that in a more general applicable of TrueSkill (e.g. Xbox Live, for which it was pioneered), it has interesting desirable properties for team play, despite the algorithm being incredibly simple.
2011-06-19T10:54:27  <jbroman> berak: (((
2011-06-19T10:54:36  <berak> aaaaaaa
2011-06-19T10:55:34  <berak> hey, i'm not critisizing that idea, it just has some funny aspects
2011-06-19T10:55:51  <locutus2> Rabidus: i have started my bot to play on your tcp server
2011-06-19T10:55:59  <Rabidus> i see
2011-06-19T10:56:12  <Rabidus> you need 4 buddies :)
2011-06-19T10:56:25  <Rabidus> ok, i'm in. 3 buddies
2011-06-19T10:57:42  <jbroman> berak: It's unusual, but I think it's actually a good thing. All that matters should be winning. If you won by a lot because you're really awesome, then presumably you're also awesome enough to win a lot of games. But if you beat someone really easy,  you don't want a disproportionate amount of reward.
2011-06-19T10:58:28  <jbroman> (If you can't tell, I <3 TrueSkill.)
2011-06-19T10:58:37  <carlop> antimatroid: seem that if you always need only the top-most element, priority_queue is better cause use less space (and less time for allocating this  space)
2011-06-19T10:59:31  <berak> jbroman, i'll side that.
2011-06-19T11:00:17  <locutus2> rabidus: i start second version
2011-06-19T11:00:20  <antimatroid> carlop: i think i'll stick to priques :)
2011-06-19T11:00:27  <berak> hey, one moar
2011-06-19T11:00:32  <antimatroid> also, i wish they'd called them prique<int>
2011-06-19T11:00:32  <berak> ;)
2011-06-19T11:00:52  <berak> like integer prick ?
2011-06-19T11:01:01  <antimatroid> prique = priority_queue
2011-06-19T11:01:37  <jbroman> I like "pqueue" better than "prique".
2011-06-19T11:01:51  <antimatroid> but prique sounds like prick!
2011-06-19T11:02:07  <jbroman> Though honestly I like that they do spell it out.
2011-06-19T11:02:45  <jbroman> antimatroid: Also, you could typedef it. :P
2011-06-19T11:03:07  <antimatroid> i could, but i like to keep things standard where possible :P
2011-06-19T11:03:17  <jbroman> And become one of those people whose types look like m< v<i>, p<l> >.
2011-06-19T11:03:41  <antimatroid> don't tempt me :P
2011-06-19T11:04:13  <jbroman> Also, the need to put that space between the two > symbols in C++ looks wrong to me. I understand why (and I think it's changed in C++0x), but it bugs me.
2011-06-19T11:04:31  <locutus2> rabidus: i see the game has started, but only of my bots show the turns passing in his starting console
2011-06-19T11:04:36  <jbroman> I want to be able to say map<int, vector<int>>, not map<int, vector<int> >.
2011-06-19T11:05:43  <antimatroid> jbroman: i don't like it either
2011-06-19T11:06:04  <antimatroid> i would love to have vector<vector<int>>
2011-06-19T11:06:51  <berak> latest standard has it
2011-06-19T11:07:04  <jbroman> Apparently the problem is that it gets tokenized as "vector, less than sign, vector, less than sign, int, right shift". But C++0x adjusts this (at the cost of some parser complexity).
2011-06-19T11:07:19  <antimatroid> i don't mind parser complexity
2011-06-19T11:07:25  <antimatroid> i don't have anything big enough to take too long
2011-06-19T11:07:53  <Rabidus> locutus2: your bot is timing out on every turn
2011-06-19T11:07:54  <antimatroid> i should ramp up my c++ understanding some time
2011-06-19T11:08:03  <antimatroid> i've just been picking pieces up as i go
2011-06-19T11:13:10  <locutus2> rabidus: it is the bot locutus_v12? their i see as last the info message for waiting to more players
2011-06-19T11:13:26  <Rabidus> lol, yes
2011-06-19T11:13:33  <Rabidus> 2011-06-19 18:11:44,184 - game.Ants - WARNING - game 3 turn 120 : locutus_v12 timed out !
2011-06-19T11:14:26  <locutus2> ok i cancel it and restart for next game
2011-06-19T11:15:36  <berak> Rabidus: cancel all and make it 3 secs timeout, 400 turns, maybe
2011-06-19T11:15:52  <Rabidus> i made it to 5 sec timeout and 350 turns
2011-06-19T11:15:58  <berak> k.
2011-06-19T11:16:08  <Rabidus> and it is running with that setup now
2011-06-19T11:16:30  <berak> 1/2  hour per game
2011-06-19T11:16:34  <Rabidus> :p

2011-06-19T11:36:47  <locutus2> is the second game already started?

2011-06-19T14:53:12  <stocha> strong and peacefull bot are a problem : they tend to favor weaker peacefull bots, and crush aggressives weaker opponents
2011-06-19T14:53:33  <stocha> so it helps the rating not being transitive
2011-06-19T14:54:57  <stocha> why are there only a hundred bots on the beta server.
2011-06-19T14:55:16  <stocha> shouldn't it be done a bit of beta has started advertising ?
2011-06-19T14:55:35  <stocha> although arguably that's enough for the computing power the server has
2011-06-19T14:55:58  <stocha> what about making a scoring based on how much time bot took for each turn ?
2011-06-19T14:56:08  <stocha> they could earn some bonus point if they go quick ?
2011-06-19T14:57:09  <stocha> a case of stalemate between peacefull bots : http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=28039&user=107
2011-06-19T14:57:47  <stocha> the game seems decided after turn 350 though.
2011-06-19T15:04:09  <berak> rare thing, isntt it ? in most of the games, there's a clear winner from tune ~200 onwards
2011-06-19T15:04:26  <berak> oh, typo
2011-06-19T15:04:47  <berak> tune in, turn on, drop out !
2011-06-19T15:04:55  <stocha> in most games with a top bot (they are aggressiv) and usually there at most one other strong bot, the game plays out pretty quick.
2011-06-19T15:05:53  <stocha> but there is a life for medium bot also. some are pacific. (the current stocha account try to run a pacific version of the stocha_greedy_ref bot)

2011-06-19T20:09:50  <amstan> ugh..
2011-06-19T20:09:51  <amstan> wtf?
2011-06-19T20:10:03  <janzert> do you remember what I had to do to fix it last time?
2011-06-19T20:10:24  <janzert> I could scrounge around again, but... :(
2011-06-19T20:10:36  <amstan> it was just an apache thing from what i remember
2011-06-19T20:10:52  <janzert> yeah, I remember it was something with the apache configuration getting changed
2011-06-19T20:10:57  <janzert> I don't remember what specifically
2011-06-19T20:11:01  <amstan> yes
2011-06-19T20:11:18  <amstan> the managing thing that the vps offers edits the apache files directly
2011-06-19T20:12:03  <janzert> yeah, I was kind of guessing that and I have a feeling that whatever got changed there is going to get reapplied now every time jeff makes a change
2011-06-19T20:12:15  <janzert> so the real fix is going to have to be changing that back

2011-06-19T20:18:08  <amstan> i was just about to post the same email in the behind the scenes forums, but then i realized that it's offline
2011-06-19T20:20:14  <amstan> janzert: i wouldn't bother anymore, i don't think this would have changed on its own
2011-06-19T20:20:20  <amstan> i think it was jeff making changes
2011-06-19T20:20:34  <amstan> we'll just talk to him tomorrow at the meeting
2011-06-19T20:20:38  <janzert> ok
2011-06-19T20:21:45  <amstan> ugh.. it was the wrong number the whole time..
2011-06-19T20:21:50  <janzert> antimatroid: just added your new maps to the beta server rotation
2011-06-19T20:21:55  <amstan> how the hell am i supposed to contact him any other way?
