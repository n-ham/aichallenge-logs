2011-12-05T00:29:08  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-12-05T00:29:14  <a1k0n> good point
2011-12-05T00:29:16  <jstrong> but its just the begs of december still

2011-12-05T00:37:18  <McLeopold> a1k0n: I can do it if I see the whole map :)
2011-12-05T00:38:09  <a1k0n> oh yeah i wanted to look at that
2011-12-05T00:38:27  <McLeopold> a1k0n: so, for each bot, pick one ant, and give it one of 8 orientations
2011-12-05T00:38:54  <a1k0n> ants.py already contains all possible symmetries for spawning food eh
2011-12-05T00:38:59  <McLeopold> each other bot has a starting ant with an orientation as well
2011-12-05T00:39:13  <bmh> a1k0n: I think you're making a mistake updating the distributions one ant at a time
2011-12-05T00:39:13  <McLeopold> so, for 2 players, there are 8 possibilities
2011-12-05T00:39:31  <a1k0n> what?  why?
2011-12-05T00:39:34  <McLeopold> for 3, I think they all have to be the same
2011-12-05T00:39:35  <a1k0n> (bmh)
2011-12-05T00:39:58  <bmh> Why don't you pick an ant, and all of the ants within (combatRadius+2), and then assign an action: push NSEW, attract, repel
2011-12-05T00:40:15  <a1k0n> could
2011-12-05T00:40:28  <a1k0n> but lazy
2011-12-05T00:40:45  <bmh> I think it will do a better job avoiding local maxima.
2011-12-05T00:41:18  <a1k0n> i have a version which tries those actions up front before random sampling
2011-12-05T00:41:20  <BenJackson> a1k0n: my combat strategy is similar to yours
2011-12-05T00:41:24  <BenJackson> with two exceptions:
2011-12-05T00:41:36  <rmmh> mmm, top players discussing combat strategy
2011-12-05T00:41:40  <BenJackson> 1) I don't work out the best enemy move, I play against all of them simultaneously
2011-12-05T00:41:43  <BenJackson> which has pros and cons
2011-12-05T00:41:45  <a1k0n> right
2011-12-05T00:41:57  <a1k0n> cause your enemy effectively multiplies
2011-12-05T00:42:04  <BenJackson> 2) I don't use your random sampling technique, I use simulated annealing
2011-12-05T00:42:26  <a1k0n> yeah, i have a simulated annealing branch too
2011-12-05T00:42:37  <a1k0n> i implemented that first actually
2011-12-05T00:42:49  <BenJackson> my rough hack to match up the scoring is that killing a potential enemy is worth 1/5th as much as my ant dying
2011-12-05T00:42:52  <a1k0n> before fixing the bugs in combat
2011-12-05T00:42:56  <rmmh> random sampling being monte-carlo method of possible enemy moves?
2011-12-05T00:43:10  <a1k0n> and possible local moves
2011-12-05T00:43:26  <a1k0n> haha i also use 5:1 scoring
2011-12-05T00:43:31  <BenJackson> oh and although you don't mention it I assume you are also salting your score with ancillary goals
2011-12-05T00:43:45  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-12-05T00:43:49  <rmmh> a1k0n: like UCT?
2011-12-05T00:43:59  <a1k0n> not really like UCT
2011-12-05T00:43:59  <BenJackson> so that the combat can also make "global" moves while in combat
2011-12-05T00:44:03  <a1k0n> no tree searches
2011-12-05T00:44:07  <jstrong> 5-1! whoa
2011-12-05T00:44:14  <jstrong> i only use 2-1 (not done with my normal form yet)
2011-12-05T00:44:21  <BenJackson> jstrong: because I play my actual ants vs their possible ants (5 possible moves for each)
2011-12-05T00:44:26  <rmmh> does anyone do more than 1-ply
2011-12-05T00:44:37  <jstrong> ah
2011-12-05T00:44:42  <jstrong> so you're doing a normal form type thing
2011-12-05T00:44:51  <BenJackson> actually I vary my ratios slightly depending on circumstances
2011-12-05T00:44:56  <BenJackson> aggressiveness, location, how many ants, etc
2011-12-05T00:45:04  <jstrong> nice
2011-12-05T00:45:12  <a1k0n> rmmh: i think a couple players attemp that but not eg xathis
2011-12-05T00:45:30  <BenJackson> the main known bug with mine is that sometimse I'll make a move where it would be devastating against some countermove
2011-12-05T00:45:34  <BenJackson> which the enemy won't actually make
2011-12-05T00:45:35  <jstrong> I -think- a good normal form algorithm is as good as you need
2011-12-05T00:45:39  <BenJackson> but sicne they don't I just lose an ant
2011-12-05T00:45:42  <a1k0n> yeah

2011-12-05T00:45:55  <jstrong> well
2011-12-05T00:46:00  <jstrong> why not pick best worst solution
2011-12-05T00:46:04  <jstrong> instead of best best :P
2011-12-05T00:46:07  <a1k0n> especially a problem with pseudo minimax simulated annealing
2011-12-05T00:46:08  <jstrong> if you know what I mean
2011-12-05T00:46:15  <a1k0n> which is the reason i sample
2011-12-05T00:46:23  <BenJackson> I also used to solve combat globally (involving all ants that are in proximity to enemy ants)
2011-12-05T00:46:25  <a1k0n> ok gotta read books to my kid, bbiab
2011-12-05T00:46:45  <BenJackson> but when I fixed my scoring to be more precise (original scoring only evaluated weakness 1 and >1)
2011-12-05T00:46:46  <bmh> a1k0n: reading them Norvig or MacKay?
2011-12-05T00:46:52  <rmmh> I need to change my loop so it's not every ant making global decisions...
2011-12-05T00:46:56  <BenJackson> the scoring got expensive so I started splitting combat into islands
2011-12-05T00:47:01  <BenJackson> which actually yields some interesting peripheral info
2011-12-05T00:47:07  <BenJackson> like local strength ratios
2011-12-05T00:47:08  <rmmh> it's dumb when I have 5 of my ants all go towards the same piece of food
2011-12-05T00:47:09  <BenJackson> which I didn' tknow before
2011-12-05T00:47:09  <jstrong> yeah islands is the way I want to go myself
2011-12-05T00:47:13  <jstrong> but I don't know how to do it
2011-12-05T00:47:23  <jstrong> I know it will involve some sort of BFS thing but haven't figured it out yet
2011-12-05T00:47:30  <BenJackson> islands?
2011-12-05T00:47:32  <rmmh> someone (animatroid?) described an island method
2011-12-05T00:47:33  <jstrong> yeah
2011-12-05T00:47:36  <a1k0n> bmh: haha, not quite
2011-12-05T00:47:36  <jstrong> i just figured it out :P
2011-12-05T00:48:13  <BenJackson> look u pconnected component labeling and union-find
2011-12-05T00:48:14  <jstrong> the thing I find hard to take into account are multiple enemy ants
2011-12-05T00:48:22  <rmmh> basically you start with your ant, then you add all the enemy ants within (combat_radius + ~2), then repeat for the ants that you added until you stop adding ants
2011-12-05T00:48:24  <McLeopold> have you ever been so bad at spelling that a spell checker can't even help you?
2011-12-05T00:48:29  <a1k0n> jstrong: find the connected components of the graph of ants within 3 distance on your bfs map
2011-12-05T00:48:38  <a1k0n> er 2 distance from your ants, or whatever
2011-12-05T00:48:57  <BenJackson> yeah, my original combat also tried to shortcut distance cals
2011-12-05T00:49:02  <BenJackson> but it involved the wrong set of ants
2011-12-05T00:49:12  <BenJackson> then I made it exactly right and discovered that had other flaws
2011-12-05T00:49:27  <bmh> McLeopold: once I typed nonsense into YouTube search (my fingers were shifted on the keyboard) and it gave me the correct result. But, no, in general my spelling is fine :)
2011-12-05T00:49:39  <jstrong> a1k0n: exactly what I was thinking
2011-12-05T00:49:43  <rmmh> has anyone tried making concaves around their base on maps like the maze
2011-12-05T00:49:52  <jstrong> if my bfs goes past 2-3 squares from nearest enemy
2011-12-05T00:50:01  <antimatroid> concaves?
2011-12-05T00:50:09  <jstrong> then it should cut off because the squares after are no longer part of that battle
2011-12-05T00:50:11  <BenJackson> keep in mind that combat involves a mix of euclidean and manhattan distances
2011-12-05T00:50:16  <jstrong> initiate from every ant
2011-12-05T00:50:30  <rmmh> perfectly defensible structures
2011-12-05T00:50:31  <jstrong> but OBVIOUSLY remove ants from being checked in the loop if you already know which island they are part of
2011-12-05T00:51:06  <BenJackson> the visualizer was really critical to verifying islands were correct
2011-12-05T00:51:20  <jstrong> yeah good point
2011-12-05T00:52:12  * antimatroid is worried about the larger maps
2011-12-05T00:52:26  <BenJackson> the size just got reduced again
2011-12-05T00:52:28  <McLeopold> antimatroid: does the 25000 max area help?
2011-12-05T00:52:31  <BenJackson> check the new specs
2011-12-05T00:52:46  <antimatroid> dunno, that's still up to like 150x150
2011-12-05T00:52:53  <antimatroid> but probably
2011-12-05T00:54:11  <McLeopold> I know I'm kinda late to the bot writing party, but could someone help me with exploration?
2011-12-05T00:54:19  <jstrong> McLeopold
2011-12-05T00:54:21  <jstrong> I'd be happy to help
2011-12-05T00:54:23  <antimatroid> McLeopold: ask...?
2011-12-05T00:54:34  <jstrong> I don't have the best bot ever but I can definitely at least help
2011-12-05T00:54:35  <McLeopold> so, what's the best way to spread out?
2011-12-05T00:54:49  <BenJackson> I'd say exploration is separate from spreading out
2011-12-05T00:54:58  <jstrong> I use a lastSeen system
2011-12-05T00:55:04  <McLeopold> it feels the same
2011-12-05T00:55:06  <BenJackson> exploration is keeping track of what you've ever seen (or seen recently for some versions) and trying to get 100% coverage
2011-12-05T00:55:17  <antimatroid> i collect unseen border info when generating closest friend hill info
2011-12-05T00:55:18  <McLeopold> one is concerned with unseen, the other with non-visible
2011-12-05T00:55:34  <antimatroid> then move ants towards that border, bombing it when i collect a location
2011-12-05T00:56:03  <antimatroid> i used to just get closest hill info across the map, but i'm just doing it to the unseen border every time i need to update, cause i want maximal time on larger maps
2011-12-05T00:56:23  <BenJackson> mcleopold: if you have a working food gathering system you could add a new kind of "food" which is just locations seeded in a grid on the map

2011-12-05T00:56:37  <BenJackson> at a rate of about the square that fits inside the vision circle
2011-12-05T00:56:38  <McLeopold> BenJackson: I tried that, but it sucked
2011-12-05T00:57:02  <BenJackson> oh I thought you were just trying to get started :)
2011-12-05T00:57:21  <McLeopold> That's the only thing I tried
2011-12-05T00:57:30  <McLeopold> and I tried tweaking it a bunch of ways
2011-12-05T00:57:31  <BenJackson> I acutally calculate the perimeter of the explored space and add every one of those squares to a goal set
2011-12-05T00:57:46  <BenJackson> but that's purely for exploration, not for spreading out
2011-12-05T00:57:55  <BenJackson> my spreading out is ridiculously brute force
2011-12-05T00:58:02  <antimatroid> i don't spread out at all
2011-12-05T00:58:26  <BenJackson> and despite my spreading out logic I still don't blend in strategy in a way that doesn't sometimes let me collapse
2011-12-05T00:58:30  <BenJackson> which can be awesome or terrible, depending
2011-12-05T00:58:42  <BenJackson> finding the *last* enemy hill and having all my ants suddenly surround it is great
2011-12-05T00:58:49  <BenJackson> if it's a huge battle and I just gave up tons of vis, oops
2011-12-05T00:59:30  <antimatroid> do you have any special order functions for searching?
2011-12-05T00:59:33  <antimatroid> even if it's a bfs?
2011-12-05T00:59:41  <antimatroid> like a priority bfs
2011-12-05T00:59:43  <bmh> BenJackson: to spread out do you just have each ant find its nearest neighbor and walk away from it?
2011-12-05T00:59:50  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-12-05T01:00:05  <antimatroid> i meant BenJackson :P
2011-12-05T01:00:08  <BenJackson> bmh: for every ant I work out what new squares it would see for every move and what squares it would stop seeing
2011-12-05T01:00:19  <BenJackson> and then I solve that for all the ants simultaneously to maximize total seen squares
2011-12-05T01:00:29  <BenJackson> actually seen is wrong because it's by walking steps and not seeing steps
2011-12-05T01:00:48  <antimatroid> oh more like terrirory?
2011-12-05T01:00:50  <BenJackson> when I wrote it I just wanted to see how it would work
2011-12-05T01:00:58  <BenJackson> since I couldn't think of a clever/fast way to do it
2011-12-05T01:01:02  <BenJackson> and if it sucked I didn't want to keep thinking about it
2011-12-05T01:01:09  <BenJackson> but it worked ok AND it didn't actually cost as much as I expected
2011-12-05T01:01:31  <BenJackson> however my ants are generally too dense
2011-12-05T01:01:42  <antimatroid> do you ever path find while avoiding potential enemy battles?
2011-12-05T01:01:48  <BenJackson> that could be good but they don't really exhibit an "antibody" behavior like I'd hoped.
2011-12-05T01:01:53  <BenJackson> individual enemy ants are just too hard to kill
2011-12-05T01:01:55  <BenJackson> too slippery
2011-12-05T01:02:06  <antimatroid> ie. calcualte the soonest battle with an enemy for each location and don't walk there if current path length is at least that soon
2011-12-05T01:02:38  <BenJackson> no, my pathfinding ignores ants at the moment
2011-12-05T01:02:51  <antimatroid> soonest enemy battle info is a bit of a pain to calculate, you need to do like the bfs but for each search location bomb the attack radius
2011-12-05T01:02:53  <BenJackson> although on my list is to actually use weighted pathfinding
2011-12-05T01:07:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you worried about time or being smart enough?
2011-12-05T01:08:11  <antimatroid> BenJackson: you iteratively collect food right?
2011-12-05T01:08:24  <antimatroid> ie. don't send multiple ants to the same food?
2011-12-05T01:08:52  <BenJackson> I pick specific ants for each food but I can pick the same ant for multiple food
2011-12-05T01:08:53  <antimatroid> how do you do that? iterated bfs, simultaneous bfs? messily update info?
2011-12-05T01:09:02  <antimatroid> same ant after its been moved?
2011-12-05T01:09:05  <BenJackson> bfs from every individual food
2011-12-05T01:09:10  <McLeopold> antimatroid: smarts
2011-12-05T01:09:14  <BenJackson> the clever bit is what order to do the searches
2011-12-05T01:09:36  <antimatroid> do you mean move an ant then re move it?
2011-12-05T01:09:42  <antimatroid> or just consider an ant for multiple food items?
2011-12-05T01:10:08  <antimatroid> i used to iteratively collect food with a* while reusing ants, but it's too slow on larger maps
2011-12-05T01:10:17  <antimatroid> with a* or bfs
2011-12-05T01:10:18  <BenJackson> remember there's not much fodo
2011-12-05T01:10:20  <BenJackson> food
2011-12-05T01:10:27  <BenJackson> so try to make the complexity scale with how much food you see
2011-12-05T01:10:32  <BenJackson> not how many ants
2011-12-05T01:10:33  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-12-05T01:10:39  <BenJackson> hence searching from food to ants
2011-12-05T01:10:51  <antimatroid> searching from food to ants and reusing ants is a pita though no?
2011-12-05T01:11:05  <antimatroid> cause you need to keep searching after finding an ant until the current path is greater than the best path found
2011-12-05T01:11:14  <pairofdice> Err
2011-12-05T01:11:20  <BenJackson> well if you bfs from food the first ant you find is the closest
2011-12-05T01:11:27  <pairofdice> That^
2011-12-05T01:11:38  <antimatroid> not if some of your ants considered for moving have already collected food and are "available" later than now
2011-12-05T01:11:45  <BenJackson> if you bfs from food and the first thing you find is *other food*...
2011-12-05T01:11:48  <antimatroid> didn't you say you're using one ant for multiple targets?
2011-12-05T01:11:55  <antimatroid> ahhhh, i get you now :P
2011-12-05T01:12:06  <antimatroid> i played with that last night
2011-12-05T01:12:13  <antimatroid> i thought it didn't work, but i'll play again
2011-12-05T01:12:14  <BenJackson> hence the importance of the order you do the food searches
2011-12-05T01:12:28  <BenJackson> IMO the only time this is important is in the very early game
2011-12-05T01:12:29  <antimatroid> do you order based on the number of adjacent food?
2011-12-05T01:12:42  <BenJackson> later food pickup is dominated by other things
2011-12-05T01:12:55  <antimatroid> and do you make the targets to food locations or the locations adjacent to food?
2011-12-05T01:13:04  <BenJackson> I think working out the order is left as an exercise for the reader here...
2011-12-05T01:13:12  <antimatroid> i think i might just search to adjacent locs cause otherwise it's a pita to correct for not actually walking on to targets
2011-12-05T01:13:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I use the same technique I did for pw
2011-12-05T01:13:26  <antimatroid> yeah sorry, i'm just poking around to see what others are doing :P
2011-12-05T01:13:30  <McLeopold> I can bfs to future ants
2011-12-05T01:13:31  <BenJackson> I use the food because using adjacent never becamet hat important
2011-12-05T01:14:02  <pairofdice> I use the adjacent locations, because it's just as easy
2011-12-05T01:14:09  <antimatroid> it's easier imo
2011-12-05T01:14:12  <antimatroid> not that i'm doing it
2011-12-05T01:14:16  <jstrong> for my food pickup i simply assign one ant per food
2011-12-05T01:14:20  <jstrong> seems to work for me
2011-12-05T01:14:31  <BenJackson> like I said, the food thing only really matters at the very beginning
2011-12-05T01:14:31  <antimatroid> i don't want fine :P
2011-12-05T01:14:37  <antimatroid> i understand that
2011-12-05T01:14:40  <BenJackson> efficiently collecting the initial food is important
2011-12-05T01:14:57  <BenJackson> after that almost anything works as long as it doesn't try to move ALL of your ants toward the food
2011-12-05T01:15:08  <antimatroid> i don't know if i like your food thing, what about a...*..*..a?
2011-12-05T01:15:48  <antimatroid> i don't need your solution, but are you correctly assigning closest ants to food?
2011-12-05T01:15:55  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it depends on where the hill is
2011-12-05T01:16:03  <antimatroid> i meant ben jackson
2011-12-05T01:16:19  <antimatroid> my understand is he'd bfs from the food, find another food and not collect both?
2011-12-05T01:16:26  <antimatroid> so then end up sending the right a to collect both?
2011-12-05T01:16:58  <McLeopold> I think I would send both ants in  with my code, but it might be worth it to harvest slower
2011-12-05T01:17:00  <BenJackson> hm, the "past other food" condition is commented out of my code
2011-12-05T01:17:11  <BenJackson> so I'd send one ant for a..a...*...*
2011-12-05T01:17:15  <antimatroid> McLeopold: bfs'ing from future ants I do by ordering BFSSearchItem by current path yeah?
2011-12-05T01:17:18  <antimatroid> that's what i'm doing anyway
2011-12-05T01:17:19  <BenJackson> but both for a...*..*...a
2011-12-05T01:17:33  <BenJackson> but only 1 for a.*..*........a
2011-12-05T01:17:57  <antimatroid> i don't think i get what you're doing :P
2011-12-05T01:18:24  <antimatroid> you search from the two *'s yeah? so what happens when they find each other? :P
2011-12-05T01:18:36  <BenJackson> nothing, that condition is commented out
2011-12-05T01:18:40  <McLeopold> antimatroid: another food item is a potential ant at some point, you just increase the distance by the detour amount, which is sometimes 0
2011-12-05T01:19:00  <antimatroid> so you're sending one ant to a single food item?
2011-12-05T01:19:08  <antimatroid> McLeopold: no it's not
2011-12-05T01:19:16  <antimatroid> adjacent to the food in 1 direction is an ant at some point
2011-12-05T01:19:25  <antimatroid> you don't actually need to walk onto the food and that no longer spawns into an ant
2011-12-05T01:19:33  <McLeopold> meh, I assumed you'd account for that :)
2011-12-05T01:19:51  <antimatroid> that's my point about not actually walking onto targets for collecting food
2011-12-05T01:20:01  <antimatroid> you want to know where the ant is going to be adjacent to the food, not where the food is
2011-12-05T01:20:03  <pairofdice> Not much of a point
2011-12-05T01:20:20  *** ltriant <ltriant!~ltriant@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has quit IRC (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep)
2011-12-05T01:20:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: okay, any point is a potential ant
2011-12-05T01:20:31  <antimatroid> it is when you're using info about where ants will be in the future :P
2011-12-05T01:20:39  *** zyberkiddy <zyberkiddy!~zyberkidd@117.206.34.232> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-05T01:20:40  <pairofdice> Because when you walk next to it, the target goes away, so you're not actually walking on top of it
2011-12-05T01:21:07  <antimatroid> but i need to know where my ant will be in the future
2011-12-05T01:21:15  <antimatroid> and that's one of the locations adjacent to the food, not the food
2011-12-05T01:21:16  <BenJackson> you do need to allow for suddenly appearing food
2011-12-05T01:21:21  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-05T01:21:24  <BenJackson> and food that starts next to you initially
2011-12-05T01:21:25  <antimatroid> i just do that at the start
2011-12-05T01:21:51  <BenJackson> in a local test I had a bot lose a game when it got stuck trying to walk AROUND initial food right by the hill
2011-12-05T01:21:56  <BenJackson> into a crevice
2011-12-05T01:22:01  <McLeopold> i figure if food suddenly appears in my path, I get a free food faster
2011-12-05T01:22:02  <antimatroid> or alternatively just tell it to move onto food, although i think the bot test thing fails you for that?
2011-12-05T01:22:06  <BenJackson> then it wouldn't come out because it didn't want to step on the hill again
2011-12-05T01:22:15  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yes, but you need to stay still to collect it at the end of the turn
2011-12-05T01:22:19  <McLeopold> true
2011-12-05T01:22:23  <antimatroid> if you path find blocking food you'll move diagonal to it
2011-12-05T01:22:45  <McLeopold> I think a1k0n lost a game with that, the initial food was next to the hill
2011-12-05T01:22:59  <antimatroid> he only loses 1 turn to get the second ant?
2011-12-05T01:23:13  <antimatroid> i think it'd be more an issue when an enemy can cause you not to get it 1 turn later
2011-12-05T01:23:33  <McLeopold> I just remember swearing and a game link :)
2011-12-05T01:23:36  <BenJackson> I've had two equally matched bots get off to radically different starts when one chose to step back into the "cave" the hill was in rather than the first ant going OUT
2011-12-05T01:23:37  <antimatroid> :)
2011-12-05T01:23:41  <BenJackson> so subtle
2011-12-05T01:23:51  <BenJackson> but then that ant lost the race to every chokepoint
2011-12-05T01:24:19  <pairofdice> Oh, now I know exactly what I'll do about food
2011-12-05T01:24:29  <antimatroid> do you set up a perimeter around your hills or just try to maximise vision around them?
2011-12-05T01:24:56  <antimatroid> i'm doing the former
2011-12-05T01:26:57  <BenJackson> I used to nail 4 ants at the corners
2011-12-05T01:27:04  <BenJackson> now it's more vague but I haven't really evaluated it
2011-12-05T01:27:09  <antimatroid> nah i don't like that, too smaller perimeter
2011-12-05T01:27:23  <antimatroid> i am pretty proud of my way to do it
2011-12-05T01:27:28  <antimatroid> although it's actually simple in the end
2011-12-05T01:27:40  <BenJackson> the tricky part of defense like that is knowing when to start defending
2011-12-05T01:27:48  <BenJackson> initially you have to abandon your hill to explore
2011-12-05T01:27:55  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-12-05T01:27:57  <BenJackson> and assume you will defend with new ants due to feeding
2011-12-05T01:28:09  <BenJackson> that's part of the reason that low-food multi-hill maps are so random
2011-12-05T01:28:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid: do I need to pass parameters to generate multi_hill_mazes?
2011-12-05T01:28:14  <antimatroid> one option is to only defend moving outwards
2011-12-05T01:28:21  <antimatroid> from a hill
2011-12-05T01:28:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: not sure :P
2011-12-05T01:28:36  <antimatroid> let me have a look
2011-12-05T01:29:08  <BenJackson> GreenTea is charging up the ranks again
2011-12-05T01:29:13  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it has min and max hill parameters
2011-12-05T01:29:24  <antimatroid> BenJackson: watch out for dmj111
2011-12-05T01:29:29  <McLeopold> anyone want to vote on the min/max values?
2011-12-05T01:29:37  <antimatroid> i noticed he had a bot in the top 30 before, and by the looks of it didn't see the contest right away
2011-12-05T01:29:43  <antimatroid> 1 :P
2011-12-05T01:29:49  <antimatroid> i hate the random tie break rule for spawning
2011-12-05T01:29:52  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I swear I was going to just let the contest go at this point but then I broke into the top 10
2011-12-05T01:29:54  <antimatroid> it's my least favourite thing about the game
2011-12-05T01:29:56  <BenJackson> and it's on again
2011-12-05T01:30:22  <antimatroid> i very much dislike things being determined randomly
2011-12-05T01:30:41  <pairofdice> :p
2011-12-05T01:31:02  <antimatroid> 1 definitely should be the minimum
2011-12-05T01:31:44  <antimatroid> BenJackson: i wont be happy until i finish top 10 after tron, that was devestating
2011-12-05T01:31:59  <antimatroid> although i'm pushing it for time on this
2011-12-05T01:32:05  <pairofdice> I chalk it up to quantum ant effects
2011-12-05T01:32:10  <BenJackson> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=161855&user=3473
2011-12-05T01:32:15  <antimatroid> yes but i want to know where future ants will spawn :P
2011-12-05T01:32:23  <BenJackson> I'm going to need to finally detect cul-de-sacs if those maps are popular
2011-12-05T01:32:27  <antimatroid> it would be much nicer if i could just execute spawn orders
2011-12-05T01:32:45  <antimatroid> those maps are my favourite so far
2011-12-05T01:32:52  <antimatroid> that's what i wanted to make, but failed
2011-12-05T01:33:48  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I wouldn't be opposed to some smaller width passages through those water walls
2011-12-05T01:34:09  <antimatroid> just so long as a 3x3 block can traverse between all hills
2011-12-05T01:34:28  <BenJackson> I think janzert (?) was saying that would be true
2011-12-05T01:34:40  <BenJackson> that many of the existing random walks are ok despite the 1-square passes
2011-12-05T01:34:41  <antimatroid> what was true?
2011-12-05T01:34:56  <antimatroid> yeah some of them are carved with 3x3 i think
2011-12-05T01:35:03  <antimatroid> but allow 1 width passages to turn up
2011-12-05T01:35:04  *** bmh <bmh!ada4e181@fsf/member/bmh> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-12-05T01:35:11  <antimatroid> but i wouldn't guarantee it, or that all map gens are doing that
2011-12-05T01:35:21  <antimatroid> map gens ended up being used that i didn't expect to be used :P
2011-12-05T01:35:49  <BenJackson> so far all I've really done since my last submission is make my bot about 15% faster
2011-12-05T01:35:56  <antimatroid> i worked out how to do the translationally symmetric maps with pencil and paper, that felt good to solve :P
2011-12-05T01:36:39  <McLeopold> I removed several bad random walks earlier
2011-12-05T01:36:46  <McLeopold> the list is in a github commit
2011-12-05T01:36:52  <antimatroid> the random walk mapgen should really be re done
2011-12-05T01:37:01  <McLeopold> right now random_walk generation passes about 40%
2011-12-05T01:37:19  <antimatroid> i would love to good map gen done with perlin noise
2011-12-05T01:37:24  <antimatroid> i could never get that working well either
2011-12-05T01:37:43  <antimatroid> that doesn
2011-12-05T01:37:45  <antimatroid> t surprise me :P
2011-12-05T01:37:56  <antimatroid> to see a*
2011-12-05T01:39:03  <Antimony> are any organizers still here?
2011-12-05T01:39:21  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-12-05T01:39:45  <antimatroid> i barely count :P
2011-12-05T01:41:46  <Antimony> Have you decided on a minimum distance between hills?
2011-12-05T01:42:01  <Antimony> I read 24, but then one map has them only 11 apart
2011-12-05T01:42:06  <McLeopold> it's 20
2011-12-05T01:42:12  <McLeopold> the spec page has been updated with it
2011-12-05T01:42:28  <McLeopold> Antimony: the bad maps should have been removed
2011-12-05T01:42:29  <Antimony> ok thanks
2011-12-05T01:42:40  <McLeopold> if you see one in a game, let us know
2011-12-05T01:42:56  <McLeopold> and that is only enemy hills
2011-12-05T01:43:03  <McLeopold> you can have your own hills within 20
2011-12-05T01:43:46  <Antimony> oh cool, lots of new restrictions
2011-12-05T01:44:00  <Antimony> maybe that will make my hill location inference slightly more efficient
2011-12-05T01:44:30  <Antimony> so the earliest possible hill razing is on turn 20?
2011-12-05T01:44:46  <McLeopold> if you're stupid, yes :P
2011-12-05T01:44:52  <Antimony> Or lucky
2011-12-05T01:44:56  <McLeopold> true
2011-12-05T01:45:21  <Antimony> Are those specifications likely to change before finals?
2011-12-05T01:45:30  <McLeopold> antimatroid: does the mapgen.py do 3 or 5 players?
2011-12-05T01:45:38  <McLeopold> Antimony: not likely
2011-12-05T01:45:41  <McLeopold> but...
2011-12-05T01:45:42  <Antimony> ok good
2011-12-05T01:45:44  <antimatroid> for translationally symmetric maps it should
2011-12-05T01:45:57  <Antimony> I guess I need to download the new maps for testing
2011-12-05T01:46:09  <Antimony> the ones in the starterpackage no longer meet the specifications
2011-12-05T01:46:37  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if you could find the time to update mapgen so hills are generated in correct distances, that would be awesome
2011-12-05T01:46:47  <antimatroid> i will try to do it this week
2011-12-05T01:46:49  <McLeopold> I'm only getting a 5% success rate
2011-12-05T01:47:16  <McLeopold> and only even numbers are passing :(
2011-12-05T01:47:19  <McLeopold> of players
2011-12-05T01:47:37  <antimatroid> i guess i need a new test map
2011-12-05T01:47:43  <antimatroid> my current one is like 190x190
2011-12-05T01:47:55  <McLeopold> oh, I got 1 3 player
2011-12-05T01:48:40  <McLeopold> antimatroid: the part that makes the walls jagged, can that be applied to any map?
2011-12-05T01:49:09  <Antimony> So if we see a 45x195 map, that means we can immediately tell that it doesn't have 10 players?
2011-12-05T01:49:28  <McLeopold> Antimony: probably
2011-12-05T01:49:44  <Antimony> WEll the specs say at least 900 sqaures per player
2011-12-05T01:49:54  <Antimony> and 45x195 is 8775
2011-12-05T01:50:01  <McLeopold> then, yes
2011-12-05T01:50:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I literally just bfs out and get the water border then randomly remove cells
2011-12-05T01:50:07  <Antimony> cool
2011-12-05T01:50:11  <McLeopold> I was thinking not divisible by 10
2011-12-05T01:50:37  <Antimony> No, all you need is at least one dimension to be divisible by 5
2011-12-05T01:50:45  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so yes, kinda.  that would open up holes in my walls
2011-12-05T01:50:55  <Antimony> or possibly, the sum or difference of dimensions
2011-12-05T01:50:59  <McLeopold> Antimony: but the other would need to be even?
2011-12-05T01:51:03  <Antimony> nope
2011-12-05T01:51:09  <antimatroid> McLeopold: does that matter?
2011-12-05T01:51:15  <Antimony> there's a lot of cases
2011-12-05T01:51:16  <McLeopold> well, it does in cell_mazes ;)
2011-12-05T01:51:20  <Antimony> you can't tell much from dimensions alone
2011-12-05T01:51:30  <antimatroid> a 3x3 block will be able to traverse the map still, but it may be more open
2011-12-05T01:51:35  <antimatroid> or you could try and thicken your walls
2011-12-05T01:51:47  <pairofdice> Or you could do the reverse
2011-12-05T01:52:12  <antimatroid> or only delete a cell with 3 water neighbours
2011-12-05T01:52:15  <Antimony> Anyway, I think it's extremely unlikely that the new restrictions will ever let my bot find a hill faster
2011-12-05T01:52:16  <McLeopold> that would be hard with my maps, because the corridors are at angles
2011-12-05T01:52:21  <Antimony> but it can't hurt I guess
2011-12-05T01:52:41  <McLeopold> I could pick a giant wall width and cell size, but then there isn't much variation
2011-12-05T01:54:12  <McLeopold> I could ensure I don't open a wall with a quick local check probably
2011-12-05T01:54:32  <McLeopold> closing off a passage would be more intense

2011-12-05T01:58:09  <_flag> McLeopold: I've been noticing a larger disparity in the rankings of the players top bots are paired up with; top bots occasionally play games with players ranked ~2000 and lower
2011-12-05T01:58:18  <_flag> Is that intentional?
2011-12-05T01:58:36  <Antimony> Wait, does the 150 max distance mean no more 2 player maze maps?
2011-12-05T01:58:51  <Antimony> those were kind of cool
2011-12-05T02:02:08  <_flag> McLeopold: nevermind, I think their mus were just fairly high
2011-12-05T02:03:33  <antimatroid> i don't see why that would mean that?
2011-12-05T02:04:54  <McLeopold> _flag: a change was made this morning to matchmaking
2011-12-05T02:05:22  <McLeopold> I thought the top bots were playing lower ranked bots too often
2011-12-05T02:05:41  <_flag> McLeopold: Maybe that's why I can't find any recent examples, thanks :)
2011-12-05T02:05:55  <McLeopold> so, you should be losing more now :)
2011-12-05T02:06:13  <Antimony> wow, who decided that the best program to open .map files is Visual Studio? Thanks Microsoft
2011-12-05T02:06:16  <_flag> haha
2011-12-05T02:06:44  <janzert> McLeopold: I thought we were going make a eucilidean and travel distance minimum for enemy hills?
2011-12-05T02:06:47  <McLeopold> It always surprises me when my made up extensions get opened by MS software...
2011-12-05T02:06:57  <McLeopold> janzert: I did
2011-12-05T02:07:00  * antimatroid is in favour of allowing enemy hills to start in view
2011-12-05T02:07:01  <Antimony> Anyway, the hill distance on maze_02p_01.map is definitely higher than 150, so I was asking it that kind of map is forbidden
2011-12-05T02:07:13  <McLeopold> antimatroid: they can
2011-12-05T02:07:16  <antimatroid> cool
2011-12-05T02:07:29  <pairofdice> Who could've thought of .map before ;)
2011-12-05T02:07:32  <janzert> looks like you have the eucilidean distance larger than the travel distance?
2011-12-05T02:07:41  <Antimony> well it's used for linker files
2011-12-05T02:07:48  <McLeopold> Antimony: multi-hill or not?
2011-12-05T02:07:52  <Antimony> it's singlehill
2011-12-05T02:07:57  <janzert> which might as well be just a eucilidean
2011-12-05T02:08:06  <Antimony> no, it's sqrt(25) which is 5
2011-12-05T02:08:11  <McLeopold> Antimony: I'm pretty sure that one was removed
2011-12-05T02:08:14  <Antimony> ok
2011-12-05T02:08:47  <McLeopold> janzert: yeah, it is squared, so just 5
2011-12-05T02:08:58  <Antimony> how can I download a pack of uptodate maps?
2011-12-05T02:09:07  <McLeopold> Antimony: wait 10 minutes
2011-12-05T02:09:10  <janzert> ok
2011-12-05T02:09:16  <McLeopold> I'll be uploading a bunch soon
2011-12-05T02:09:47  <McLeopold> _flag: you had a timeout?
2011-12-05T02:09:51  <janzert> radius squared doesn't make much sense there to me, radius apparently == distance there?
2011-12-05T02:10:05  <_flag> McLeopold: very rare bug, I've fixed it already but it doesn't warrent a reupload
2011-12-05T02:10:26  <McLeopold> good thing you still won :)
2011-12-05T02:10:38  <janzert> also I would still prefer saying that the hills must be traversable by a 3x3 block no a minimum amount of the map
2011-12-05T02:10:38  <_flag> Yeah, that would've been a really embarassing loss
2011-12-05T02:10:56  <McLeopold> janzert: that is there too
2011-12-05T02:11:06  <janzert> it says 2/3rds traversable
2011-12-05T02:11:07  <McLeopold> feel free to update the specs to make it clear
2011-12-05T02:11:17  <McLeopold> hills must be in that 2/3rds
2011-12-05T02:11:40  <janzert> I want to get rid of the 2/3rds is what I'm saying
2011-12-05T02:11:50  <McLeopold> oh
2011-12-05T02:11:52  <janzert> it could be 10% if you can travel through all the hills
2011-12-05T02:11:52  <McLeopold> why?
2011-12-05T02:12:16  <janzert> more general and accomplishes what we want
2011-12-05T02:12:27  <McLeopold> yeah, ok
2011-12-05T02:13:44  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm going to upload a bunch of maps, I'll add that check later

2011-12-05T02:14:28  <janzert> are these more just cell maze maps?

2011-12-05T02:16:46  <janzert> map types
2011-12-05T02:17:02  <janzert> so there are roughly equal numbers of each type
2011-12-05T02:17:18  <McLeopold> can we consider maze and multi-hill maze the same type?
2011-12-05T02:17:22  <McLeopold> and, yes 100 of each
2011-12-05T02:17:53  <janzert> yeah, fine with me
2011-12-05T02:18:04  <janzert> did you put a limit on the number of hills?
2011-12-05T02:18:09  <McLeopold> 5
2011-12-05T02:18:25  <janzert> sounds good
2011-12-05T02:18:36  <McLeopold> those will mostly fail though
2011-12-05T02:18:53  <McLeopold> until antimatroid can get some good checks into the gen
2011-12-05T02:18:54  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Map-Format look good?
2011-12-05T02:19:54  <McLeopold> does the close range sentence sound backwards?
2011-12-05T02:20:44  <janzert> yeah, I was just thinking that
2011-12-05T02:20:56  <antimatroid> I think change produce and can to Produce and Can at the end
2011-12-05T02:20:58  <antimatroid> otherwise looks good

2011-12-05T03:05:55  <antimatroid> ho, ho, i think i just worked out an awesome way to iteratively collect targets :D
2011-12-05T03:08:20  <McLeopold> do tell
2011-12-05T03:08:36  <thestinger> wow, I wasn't preventing collisions for enemy move prediction
2011-12-05T03:09:24  <antimatroid> above is a hint
2011-12-05T03:09:32  <antimatroid> i'll try and describe but it might be a bit messy
2011-12-05T03:09:48  <BenJackson> thestinger I still don't :)
2011-12-05T03:09:56  <thestinger> antimatroid: so you mean sending one ant on the ideal path to collect a few food?
2011-12-05T03:10:11  <thestinger> or ideal-ish
2011-12-05T03:10:59  <thestinger> BenJackson: btw, I figured out another way to trick gcc into optimizing more
2011-12-05T03:11:02  <antimatroid> for each ant, find the a closest path target and add the "move" (aLoc, mLoc, direction, cLoc) to a priority queue, also do this for each target to another target and add these moves, then keep pulling off moves and making them if the aLocation is currently an ant and the food location hasn't been collected
2011-12-05T03:11:17  <thestinger> I put every class/struct into an anonymous namespace, and the binary is now 50% smaller
2011-12-05T03:11:20  <antimatroid> food/target
2011-12-05T03:11:24  <antimatroid> i think that works?
2011-12-05T03:11:25  <thestinger> so I assume it resulted in some crazy optimization....
2011-12-05T03:11:31  <antimatroid> that would be fantastic if it does
2011-12-05T03:12:01  <BenJackson> probably prevents it from emiting the (unused) extern versions of everythign that was inlined
2011-12-05T03:12:17  <thestinger> well, now I don't get -Winline warnings for default constructors/destructors etc.
2011-12-05T03:12:20  <antimatroid> what do people think of that idea?
2011-12-05T03:12:27  <thestinger> before it wasn't inlining all that stuff to prevent code from growing too much
2011-12-05T03:12:56  <BenJackson> antimatriod: I think you've just described a transformation of a graph of ants to targets into ants and targets to targets
2011-12-05T03:13:07  <BenJackson> and then did pathfindign on that graph, weighted by path length between each
2011-12-05T03:13:14  <thestinger> gcc has some sort of aversion to inlining something that could be used in another translation unit
2011-12-05T03:13:36  <antimatroid> BenJackson: yeah pretty much
2011-12-05T03:13:38  <BenJackson> did you try "flatten"?
2011-12-05T03:13:45  <antimatroid> i like it though :P
2011-12-05T03:13:45  <BenJackson> helped my combat eval
2011-12-05T03:13:54  <BenJackson> otherwise there's some limit to how far the inlining will go
2011-12-05T03:14:15  <thestinger> ah, haven't tried that yet
2011-12-05T03:14:15  <BenJackson> you should like flatten: it's the inlining equivalent of your putting everything in one file
2011-12-05T03:14:25  <BenJackson> actually if you flattened main you might get a one-function bot ;-)
2011-12-05T03:15:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: do you like?
2011-12-05T03:15:37  <thestinger> wow, -fwhole-program speeds stuff up a _lot_
2011-12-05T03:16:30  <BenJackson> heh, -combine is the equivalent to your giant file
2011-12-05T03:16:49  <thestinger> "giant" :P
2011-12-05T03:16:51  <thestinger> 1400 lines
2011-12-05T03:18:38  <thestinger> -flto probably accomplishes the same optimizations anyway
2011-12-05T03:22:07  <McLeopold> antimatroid: reading...
2011-12-05T03:22:29  <antimatroid> you might need to play around with it a bit
2011-12-05T03:22:54  <antimatroid> like i think for each food location you want to find the closest ant not used yet

2011-12-05T03:24:24  <McLeopold> that will be worse :)
2011-12-05T03:25:07  <McLeopold> wouldn't you send multiple ants to the same food then?
2011-12-05T03:25:32  <McLeopold> if one ant collects, the path to the next target would be taken
2011-12-05T03:25:49  <McLeopold> or do you mean if the food is not going to be collected in the future?
2011-12-05T03:27:02  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/gRnEgL4z
2011-12-05T03:27:17  <antimatroid> try now
2011-12-05T03:27:21  <antimatroid> i had to do a captcha
2011-12-05T03:28:17  <antimatroid> so for each ant and target you have a move to another target of shortest path
2011-12-05T03:28:20  <antimatroid> it's not perfect
2011-12-05T03:28:25  <antimatroid> but might work wellish
2011-12-05T03:28:36  <BenJackson> that's similar to what I was talking about
2011-12-05T03:28:38  <thestinger> BenJackson: pure seems to work very well
2011-12-05T03:28:41  <BenJackson> the ordering of the food makes it work
2011-12-05T03:28:49  <BenJackson> pure helps on things like getLocation
2011-12-05T03:28:53  <antimatroid> heh, sorry :P
2011-12-05T03:28:57  <BenJackson> lets the compiler hoist things
2011-12-05T03:29:01  <thestinger> all my functions can be given pure basically...
2011-12-05T03:29:27  <thestinger> I find it strange that gcc can't figure that out itself
2011-12-05T03:30:20  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-05T03:30:33  <thestinger> so if you pass a function a reference to something and it alters it, it can't be pure?
2011-12-05T03:30:44  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-05T03:30:55  <BenJackson> pure means "function of arguments (and globals)"
2011-12-05T03:31:14  <BenJackson> it just helps the compiler do CSE and hoisting
2011-12-05T03:31:23  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so, d(a,F) would need to be the d(a,f) + d(f,F)?
2011-12-05T03:31:31  <BenJackson> the visualizer is making me lazy
2011-12-05T03:31:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yep
2011-12-05T03:31:42  <BenJackson> I'm just visualizing my function over and over instead of really thinking
2011-12-05T03:31:43  <McLeopold> yeah, I like it
2011-12-05T03:31:44  <antimatroid> and you'd need to like combine the two lots of info
2011-12-05T03:32:10  <McLeopold> I think that is what I'm doing now

2011-12-05T03:40:57  <antimatroid> i have a couple of things i'm keeping mostly to myself which i haven't really seen much talk about
2011-12-05T03:41:08  <antimatroid> I know ChrisH is doing one of them
2011-12-05T03:41:22  <BenJackson> yeah as I figure out things I spot other top players doing them
2011-12-05T03:43:51  <Fluxid> i'm not capable of keeping things only to myself
2011-12-05T03:44:22  <Fluxid> i already told everything about my bot, lol
2011-12-05T03:44:48  <antimatroid> i am fairly terrible
2011-12-05T03:45:04  <antimatroid> i shared a couple of things with ChrisH although i'm not sure if he'll use them and he already had some
2011-12-05T03:45:23  <Fluxid> i bet BenJackson used the part of code i shared here xD
2011-12-05T03:45:38  <BenJackson> no, I wrote that same thing several weeks before
2011-12-05T03:45:43  <Fluxid> :)
2011-12-05T03:46:13  <BenJackson> I may be totally wrong
2011-12-05T03:46:21  <BenJackson> new goals are always neat to watch
2011-12-05T03:46:32  <BenJackson> but sometimes it turns out it screws up something else mor important

2011-12-05T04:05:12  <janzert> so cutoff_turns doesn't increment if the hive is being wiped out basically
2011-12-05T04:05:12  <McLeopold> oh, that's so easy
2011-12-05T04:05:22  <McLeopold> why didn't I think of that
2011-12-05T04:05:41  <janzert> notice that the check shouldn't go in the outer conditional at line 1492 though
2011-12-05T04:06:01  <McLeopold> I think I'm off on line numbers
2011-12-05T04:06:40  <janzert> just sec
2011-12-05T04:07:06  <McLeopold> so, you want the count to reset if there is a hill collision?

2011-12-05T04:09:17  <janzert> on a enemy hill specifically
2011-12-05T04:10:30  <janzert> of course if his own hive is getting wiped out most likely he's going to drop down below the cutoff percentage anyway
2011-12-05T04:11:24  <janzert> we have rank and skill display stuff scattered all over the website code right?
2011-12-05T04:11:49  <janzert> i.e. there wouldn't be an easy way to hide the rank and skill of top 100 bots for the end of the finals
2011-12-05T04:15:58  <jix> boost is available for c++ isn't it? and what version?

2011-12-05T04:17:30  <jix> McLeopold: that will be a very costly way to stall the counter, since no ants can spawn for you
2011-12-05T04:17:35  <McLeopold> yeah, probably not worth worrying about
2011-12-05T04:17:48  <janzert> that is a good reason to only check enemies of the dominant bot though
2011-12-05T04:18:10  <McLeopold> janzert: you could prolong your own cutoff if you are dominant, while searching
2011-12-05T04:18:15  <thestinger> jix: I don't think boost is available

2011-12-05T04:18:29  <janzert> guess I wasn't clear before then
2011-12-05T04:18:34  <thestinger> it's mostly header only so you can try to include it in your zip, but an include path isn't set
2011-12-05T04:18:48  <janzert> I meant to only check enemies of the dominant bot for deaths on their hills
2011-12-05T04:18:50  <thestinger> jix: which part of boost did you want? you can use C++11 which has a lot of the good stuff
2011-12-05T04:19:05  <McLeopold> oh
2011-12-05T04:19:06  <thestinger> std::array, std::tuple, std::unordered_set, std::unordered_map, lambdas, etc
2011-12-05T04:19:09  <McLeopold> ok
2011-12-05T04:19:26  <McLeopold> so only 1 bot doesn't get to stall
2011-12-05T04:19:29  <jix> thestinger: yeah I'm using C++11 but gcc-4.5 used on the server doesn't support for(Foo bar: baz) loops
2011-12-05T04:19:33  <janzert> right
2011-12-05T04:19:44  <jix> thestinger: so I'd like to use boost's foreach
2011-12-05T04:19:51  <janzert> and generally it's in the best interests of the other bots to hurry the cutoff not stall it
2011-12-05T04:20:07  <janzert> for situations I can think of at least
2011-12-05T04:20:13  <thestinger> jix: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/for_each it's different than this?
2011-12-05T04:20:35  <jix> thestinger: yeah, it's a macro that behaves likea  builtin loop
2011-12-05T04:20:39  <thestinger> ah
2011-12-05T04:20:40  <jix> so you can use break etc

2011-12-05T04:21:22  <jix> thestinger: I guess for_each would work ok-ish if you pass it a lambda (does that work? never used c++11 before) but the new c++11 for or alternativly boost's foreach is still nicer
2011-12-05T04:21:42  <thestinger> yeah, for (auto &v : container) is nice
2011-12-05T04:21:46  <thestinger> you can pass for_each a lambda though
2011-12-05T04:21:56  <McLeopold> where did that logging come from :)
2011-12-05T04:22:13  <thestinger> for (auto it = container.begin(); it != end; ++it) { } isn't that bad :P

2011-12-05T04:23:45  <janzert> yeah, latest looks right to me without trying it
2011-12-05T04:24:07  <thestinger> jix: if you use cbegin() and cend() that won't happen
2011-12-05T04:24:54  <jix> thestinger: oh since they're const the compiler is free to move the .cend() out of the loop?
2011-12-05T04:25:10  <thestinger> yeah, because you can't change the container by using them
2011-12-05T04:25:59  <jix> thestinger: well I'll try to somehow bundle the boost headers then or convince some admin that providing boost would be a good thing
2011-12-05T04:26:04  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, I'll let you update the workers
2011-12-05T04:26:10  <McLeopold> I'll post to the forum
2011-12-05T04:26:21  <thestinger> jix: well, you just need the include path set to something
2011-12-05T04:27:24  <thestinger> you can't really do it without that, because all the boost headers assume the others are available in the include path
2011-12-05T04:27:36  <thestinger> and they do crazy stuff with macros
2011-12-05T04:28:40  <jix> thestinger: hmm yeah and ubuntu doesn't have the current boost release which aims for c++11 compatibility
2011-12-05T04:31:55  <janzert> McLeopold: also any thoughts on worker scaling limits?
2011-12-05T04:32:26  <janzert> specifically what number of workers we will run into problems with the current setup

2011-12-05T04:34:39  <janzert> server load or the match making race condition becoming unbearably bad are my top two choices for contender of the first problem
2011-12-05T04:34:55  <McLeopold> hmm
2011-12-05T04:35:03  <janzert> I'm just not sure if we hit that at 20 workers or 50
2011-12-05T04:35:10  <McLeopold> we can run a process on the server to generate matchups, instead of the php
2011-12-05T04:35:20  <janzert> oh that reminds me
2011-12-05T04:35:45  <McLeopold> if we keep it at workers+1 matches, we should be able to ensure the stored procedure doesn't run at the same time
2011-12-05T04:35:59  <janzert> yeah, that would help
2011-12-05T04:36:13  <janzert> I also want to change it so I can pregenerate matches anyway
2011-12-05T04:36:25  <McLeopold> you mean pick the players?
2011-12-05T04:36:43  <janzert> I'm thinking of doing a few rounds of random pairings at the start of the finals
2011-12-05T04:37:06  <McLeopold> you can write another procedure to create the db records
2011-12-05T04:37:12  <McLeopold> or a python program :)
2011-12-05T04:37:13  <janzert> basically take the list of players shuffle it and then go through the maps and make matches just drawing off the top of the list
2011-12-05T04:38:04  <McLeopold> we could start everyone with a 2 player game, then a 3 player and so on
2011-12-05T04:38:21  <janzert> I think just go through all the maps
2011-12-05T04:38:32  <jix> janzert: would it be possible to add ``-isystem sysinclude'' to the arguments passed to g++ so we can bundle headers in the directory sysinclude that are found by #include <foo>?
2011-12-05T04:38:45  <janzert> I don't really want to bias the game type just get everyone an even random pairing
2011-12-05T04:38:54  <janzert> for a couple games to get things started
2011-12-05T04:38:59  <janzert> seed the rankings basically
2011-12-05T04:39:18  <janzert> jix: probably not for this contest
2011-12-05T04:39:28  <McLeopold> you would need to go through the list at least twice
2011-12-05T04:39:32  <janzert> right
2011-12-05T04:39:36  <jix> janzert: too late?
2011-12-05T04:39:43  <janzert> jix: yeah, pretty much
2011-12-05T04:40:03  <McLeopold> maybe more if you want unique mu and sigma
2011-12-05T04:40:27  <janzert> nah, don't need to go that far :)
2011-12-05T04:40:37  <McLeopold> 3 times should do it
2011-12-05T04:41:06  <janzert> if the resources are there for it I was thinking 3 or 4
2011-12-05T04:41:16  <janzert> but not sure if we will or not
2011-12-05T04:41:40  <McLeopold> how many games does everyone get before cutoffs?
2011-12-05T04:41:54  <janzert> right now I'm hoping for 7
2011-12-05T04:42:14  <jix> janzert: if someone would come up with a way for users to specify how to build bots (within safe limits) is there a chance for it to be included in a next contest?
2011-12-05T04:42:19  <janzert> but it's going to be tight, if the financial stuff goes through I'm hoping for at least 10
2011-12-05T04:42:33  <janzert> jix: yes, that's the plan actually
2011-12-05T04:42:58  <jix> cool :)
2011-12-05T04:43:28  <McLeopold> janzert: what about max turns? are you ever going to update?
2011-12-05T04:43:53  <janzert> at this point I'm not planning too
2011-12-05T04:44:11  <McLeopold> why not?
2011-12-05T04:44:51  <janzert> no time and it's getting close enough to the end for me not to be comfortable with it anymore
2011-12-05T04:45:00  <McLeopold> ok
2011-12-05T04:46:02  <janzert> the cutoffs do a fairly decent job and more flexibly anyway
2011-12-05T04:49:30  <McLeopold> but max_turns is a cutoff :)
2011-12-05T04:49:46  <janzert> just a very crude one :)
2011-12-05T04:49:47  <McLeopold> I'd only lower it at this point
2011-12-05T04:49:53  <McLeopold> 1000 is find
2011-12-05T04:49:55  <McLeopold> fine

2011-12-05T08:38:59  <TwistedLogic> the number of ants is lower than the turn at midway yet when the turn limit was reached the number of ants is greater than the turn limit

2011-12-05T08:42:44  <thestinger> on a big map with lots of ants/food
2011-12-05T08:43:19  <thestinger> the core you get on EC2 is probably a lot slower than a core on your CPU

2011-12-05T15:19:20  <Zannick> interesting, indeed
2011-12-05T15:19:40  <LouisMartin> I'm getting    "playgame.py: error: option --food_rate: invalid integer value: '--food_turn=27'   with playgame.py.  the food_rate parameter is: --food_rate=8
2011-12-05T15:19:47  <LouisMartin> any idea why?
2011-12-05T15:20:31  <Zannick> try --food_rate 8 --food_turn 27
2011-12-05T15:20:59  <Zannick> my guess is it's doing something stupid like discarding the =8 and then interpreting your next flag as the value
2011-12-05T15:21:46  <LouisMartin> pretty sure I tried that and it failed too.
2011-12-05T15:22:00  <LouisMartin> I'll retry
2011-12-05T15:24:15  <g0llum> there's no '=' for the params there, just a blank for splitting key/value
2011-12-05T15:24:27  <Zannick> if it still fails, please pastebin the full commandline and error message
2011-12-05T15:24:36  <g0llum> so, what Zannick said
2011-12-05T15:27:21  <LouisMartin> still not working.  http://pastebin.com/0dYLMCUw
2011-12-05T15:27:44  <LouisMartin> the error message is: You must specify a map file.  playgame.py: error: option --food_rate: invalid integer value: '--food_turn'

2011-12-05T15:35:44  <bugnuts2> LouisMartin: you provide two ints like this  --food_rate 5 11

2011-12-05T15:37:23  <LouisMartin> bugnuts: ah!  I thought the "game settings" section was specifying a range, as in from 5 to 11. So it's  5/11, given as 5 11?

2011-12-05T15:37:41  <bugnuts2> yes indeed.
2011-12-05T15:37:46  <McLeopold> no quite
2011-12-05T15:37:51  <LouisMartin> right :)  thanks.
2011-12-05T15:38:09  <McLeopold> food_rate is numerator, food_turn is denominator
2011-12-05T15:38:16  <LouisMartin> McLeopold: but is  --food_rate 5 11  correct as a parameter?
2011-12-05T15:38:29  <McLeopold> yes, you give it a range to choose from randomly
2011-12-05T15:38:40  <McLeopold> if you want to set it, do --food_rate 5, 6
2011-12-05T15:38:49  <bugnuts2> ah ok.  I just did it to match the game settings.
2011-12-05T15:38:50  <McLeopold> I think food_rate 5 5 will error out

2011-12-05T16:21:54  <BenJackson> I'm also in a game
2011-12-05T16:22:14  <ChrisH_> the thing is, bots that rush everything at hills early like that are much more inonsistent so they don't rank up as well, even though they occassional take down good bots
2011-12-05T16:22:20  <BenJackson> static defense works pretty well in low food games
2011-12-05T16:22:29  <BenJackson> lack of map vision doesn't matter
2011-12-05T16:22:35  <a1k0n> yeah one of my ants did something stupid there
2011-12-05T16:22:35  <BenJackson> and lone ants can't do anything against it
2011-12-05T16:23:06  <a1k0n> yeah.  didn't have enough ants in there to take it down, and the ants i did have failed to work together

2011-12-05T16:24:54  <ChrisH_> my most recent game agains xathis 1on1 (in which I beat him solo for the first time) is interesting to analyze as well
2011-12-05T16:24:56  <BenJackson> janzert: can you tell me who the seed was in 161194?  I think I had deactivated by then, but I wonder why I was thrown into that mix

2011-12-05T16:26:04  <ChrisH_> xathis has a weakness in that he likes to chase enemy ants back into his own territory and it leaves an opening for the opponent to collapse his borders and gain a territorial advantage
2011-12-05T16:26:18  <a1k0n> ChrisH_: wow nice job
2011-12-05T16:26:41  <BenJackson> I made a slight tweak just before uploading version 10 which caused me to be more willing to slip by stalemates rather than fight them

2011-12-05T16:26:57  <BenJackson> so sometimes you'll see fights where they kind of rotate sideways and then I go by the old stalemate, letting a bunch of ants IN
2011-12-05T16:27:04  <a1k0n> are you doing a minimax type of scoring for moves?  my bot would attack much more aggressively instead of hemming him in
2011-12-05T16:27:24  <janzert> BenJackson: Paratrechina was seed
2011-12-05T16:27:47  <BenJackson> ouch
2011-12-05T16:27:52  <a1k0n> heyyyyyyy!  pguillory finally is in 1st
2011-12-05T16:27:54  <BenJackson> (my last game, not Paratrechina)
2011-12-05T16:28:01  <a1k0n> xathis toppled on game 200
2011-12-05T16:28:20  <janzert> my guess would be you were second player chosen then randomly a very low player got pulled in and that weighted it so the rest were quite low as well
2011-12-05T16:28:20  <ChrisH_> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=163870&user=10  watch the two ants around 42, 79 starting on turn 246 and see how they drag a bunch xathis's ants away from the border
2011-12-05T16:28:33  <a1k0n> oh man he got screwed: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=165956&user=4513

2011-12-05T16:29:21  <BenJackson> they just left the fight

2011-12-05T17:17:21  <xathis> ChrisH_:  i really expected someone to implement that but nobody did, probably it's not worth it
2011-12-05T17:17:24  <ChrisH_> and there was a big discussion with McLeopold and janzert about whether to change the game rules to prevent that, but it was decided all the alternatives were much worse

2011-12-05T17:18:44  <xathis> a few months but one or two weeks before the start the game was changed to contain hills, it was different before
2011-12-05T17:18:54  <ChrisH_> xathis: you mean to not step on the hill on a multi-hill map to keep draining the hive even if the ants are spawning continuously?
2011-12-05T17:19:46  <xathis> ChrisH_: if there are ants spawning continously you wouldn't be able to raze the hill anyway or are you?
2011-12-05T17:20:24  <ChrisH_> xathis: no, you're not, but you could stupidly suicide your ants instead of staying in combat range and taking now casualties while the hive is drained

2011-12-05T17:21:34  <Fluxid> http://appsumoforlife.com/~rBaP ;)
2011-12-05T17:21:52  <xathis> ChrisH_: the problem is that if your enemy has two hills and you get control of one of them, then it would be clever to not raze it, so that every second ant he spawns would be killed right away
2011-12-05T17:22:45  <ChrisH_> xathis: right, but you also need to be clever enough to step on the hill before anyone else can get to it or kill your ants, and you also need to avoid the "ants not razing hills" cutoff
2011-12-05T17:22:53  <xathis> but i don't know if it's worth it because then a third player could raze the other hill more easily
2011-12-05T17:23:08  <ChrisH_> also a good point
2011-12-05T17:23:31  <ChrisH_> and you may not know if there is another hill still alive
2011-12-05T17:23:49  <xathis> ChrisH_: Ants not razing hills is not often in multi hill maps and if you see other enemies approaching you can just step on the hill before them
2011-12-05T17:24:19  <xathis> ChrisH_: but yeah, lots of problems to consider
2011-12-05T17:24:40  <ChrisH_> xathis: I could see it as possible in a 2 hill/player map, and on maps with only two or three players
2011-12-05T17:25:27  <ChrisH_> if your strategy was to not step on hills until the last minute you are making that outcome more likey as you (hopefully) gain control of more and more of the hills on the map
2011-12-05T17:26:49  <xathis> ChrisH_: yeah. i'm happy noone implemented it though because it's against the spirit of the game not to raze hills on purpose and games would take longer
2011-12-05T17:26:58  <ChrisH_> I think most peole (myself included) are plenty busy trying to make their bots smart in the general case and don't have time to work on such specialty strategies
2011-12-05T17:28:13  <ChrisH_> i'm not sure they would take longer, because more ants would die and hasten the end of the game, but i agree that it seems against the spirit of the game
2011-12-05T17:29:13  <ChrisH_> xathis: are you planning to do a post-mortem when the contest is over?

2011-12-05T19:00:01  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: no, but avoiding that problem was just fixed by McLeopold yesterday
2011-12-05T19:00:23  * antimatroid still doesn't like that games get called off before rankings are finalised
2011-12-05T19:01:01  * ChrisH_ understands antimatroid's concern, but wonders if some games could go forever without the cutoff rules.
2011-12-05T19:01:10  <antimatroid> i don't mind a max turn limit
2011-12-05T19:01:24  <antimatroid> but if we want to cut games shorter than that we need to do it when rankings are finalised imo
2011-12-05T19:01:35  <antimatroid> otherwise it's sort of like a bonus for being the last person the better bot tried to attack
2011-12-05T19:01:39  <a1k0n> what about a roomfull of starter bots all going up?
2011-12-05T19:01:42  <antimatroid> which is insane because that can largely depend on the map
2011-12-05T19:03:31  <antimatroid> ie. something like a.b.c.d. and c takes out b and d first
2011-12-05T19:03:40  <antimatroid> c gets second place only because c didn't get to kill them yet
2011-12-05T19:03:46  <antimatroid> a sorry
2011-12-05T19:03:55  <antimatroid> a gets second place*
2011-12-05T19:04:44  <ChrisH_> i agree with you on that point
2011-12-05T19:05:02  <BenJackson> it is a problem that "rank stabilized" doesn't mean ALL ants ranks are stabilized
2011-12-05T19:05:02  <ikaros> i got cutoffs on some maze maps 3 turns before i razed the enemy hill :)
2011-12-05T19:05:09  <BenJackson> which the trueskill algo does care about
2011-12-05T19:05:11  <ikaros> but they removed alot of maps i recognized

2011-12-05T19:05:46  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't think it should be called "rank stabilised" if we're going to do it as now, perhaps "no bots can increase in ranking"?
2011-12-05T19:05:53  <antimatroid> because that's what it really is
2011-12-05T19:05:57  <a1k0n> indeed

2011-12-05T19:12:05  <a1k0n> if you have a really strong bot up against a bunch of weak ones, you'll see 1. strong bot  2. didn't-get-to-kill-him-yet  3.  weak #1  3.  weak #2  3.  weak #3, etc
2011-12-05T19:12:16  <ChrisH_> no, only that all bots with an active hill cannot go up in rank anymore
2011-12-05T19:14:55  <antimatroid> it's a bit iffy
2011-12-05T19:15:16  <antimatroid> it's probably unideal to change at this point too

2011-12-05T19:19:09  <BenJackson> performance got slightly worse, which was unexpected

2011-12-05T19:20:21  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: you were complaining about not leading in org "Other", I guess I can complain about not leading my country or even programming language.  ;)

2011-12-05T19:21:01  <ChrisH_> And there are only 44 of us using the language.
2011-12-05T19:21:06  <BenJackson> I should switch to C++11
2011-12-05T19:21:11  <antimatroid> @rankings
2011-12-05T19:21:12  <contestbot> antimatroid: Top 10 players: pguillory(90.8), xathis(90.2), ChrisH(89.7), delineate(87.6), BenJackson(86.6), ThisIsNotABug(86.1), RVeerdonk(86.0), MomoBot(85.9), Migi32(85.7), Memetix(85.6)
2011-12-05T19:21:15  <a1k0n> and pguillory *just* rewrote his bot in go, just to spite you
2011-12-05T19:21:15  <BenJackson> for no other reason than to win C++11

2011-12-05T19:22:12  <antimatroid> although that did seem rather strange :P
2011-12-05T19:22:17  <BenJackson> took me about 5 days to stabilize (in part because I didn't win reliably enough) so I may get in 2 more submits
2011-12-05T19:22:29  <BenJackson> hopefully I'll have the discipline not to submit after the 13th :)
2011-12-05T19:22:31  <antimatroid> meh, all rankings reset at the end
2011-12-05T19:22:48  <BenJackson> not to carry over rank
2011-12-05T19:22:51  <BenJackson> to avoid last minute bugs
2011-12-05T19:22:57  <antimatroid> oh sure
2011-12-05T19:23:12  <a1k0n> i *almost* resubmitted my tron bot right at the end, but didn't
2011-12-05T19:23:34  <a1k0n> a tale of caution, if not a cautionary tale
2011-12-05T19:23:35  <BenJackson> I was ready to be ok with top 20
2011-12-05T19:23:36  <antimatroid> no rufes band near the top this time?
2011-12-05T19:23:38  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: I think it's pretty cool that there are six Go bots in the top 100, and I really hope pguillory writes a postmortem because I'm curious about his experience with Go as well.
2011-12-05T19:23:59  <antimatroid> you guys have got me interested in go :P
2011-12-05T19:24:00  <a1k0n> BenJackson: haha, seriously.  the bug bites you when you realize it's possible
2011-12-05T19:24:06  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: I'm really interested in the Go bots because I had a passing interest in Go but I didn't see anything I really liked
2011-12-05T19:24:19  <BenJackson> having some examples in a domain I'm not intimately familiar with would be great
2011-12-05T19:24:59  <BenJackson> sounds like strcat has done some interesting things with C++11 as well
2011-12-05T19:25:06  <ChrisH_> Yeah, with PW I was set to be happy with top 400, then 200, then 100, then 50, and was proud and amazed to pull off top 25.
2011-12-05T19:25:22  <antimatroid> tron ruined my expectations without results :P
2011-12-05T19:25:25  <a1k0n> i had basically the opposite experience in PW and got demoralized
2011-12-05T19:25:36  <ChrisH_> a1k0n: bummer
2011-12-05T19:25:46  <a1k0n> i tried to do a similar minimax-simulated-annealing thing and it didn't work out at all
2011-12-05T19:25:51  * antimatroid enjoyed kicking a1k0ns ass in planet wars though :P
2011-12-05T19:25:53  <ChrisH_> but understable considering you won tron right
2011-12-05T19:25:55  <BenJackson> I got a bit down when I went about a week and half between resubmits and the skill in the top 50 had gone way up
2011-12-05T19:25:59  <BenJackson> so I thought I'd broken everything
2011-12-05T19:26:12  <a1k0n> but the contest opened with me in 1st place with my stupid greedy bot, purely by luck
2011-12-05T19:26:25  <BenJackson> I was actually shocked when I hit 6th on saturday or whatever
2011-12-05T19:26:32  <BenJackson> I was somewhere with no internet so I looked from my phone
2011-12-05T19:26:37  <antimatroid> hehe
2011-12-05T19:26:53  <a1k0n> yeah i don't get how my bot got up to 5th
2011-12-05T19:27:02  <a1k0n> and on tcp your bot kicks mine's ass consistently now
2011-12-05T19:27:14  <BenJackson> I need to restart my fluxid bot
2011-12-05T19:27:26  <BenJackson> I never did figure out why it consumed all file descriptors on my system
2011-12-05T19:27:26  <a1k0n> so i'll be happy with the top 10 but if someone takes my advice in the forum and beats me with it i won't feel too bad about it
2011-12-05T19:27:35  <a1k0n> haha that sounds bad

2011-12-05T19:28:12  <antimatroid> a1k0n: for strategy ideas like that it often comes down to implementation rather than the general idea no?
2011-12-05T19:28:18  <a1k0n> antimatroid: precisely
2011-12-05T19:28:20  <BenJackson> I meant to follow up with some links on simulated annealing
2011-12-05T19:28:37  <a1k0n> that was definitely the game in tron.  everyone knew exactly what to implement, but *how* was tricky
2011-12-05T19:28:39  <antimatroid> i share what i do generally, but some bits of information or whatever i prefer not to openly share
2011-12-05T19:29:03  <BenJackson> ah I see Hungarian came up
2011-12-05T19:29:16  <a1k0n> yep, but i don't see how to use that honestly
2011-12-05T19:29:16  <BenJackson> I actually implemented a Kuhn Munkres for this
2011-12-05T19:29:22  <BenJackson> but I couldn't figure out how to USE it
2011-12-05T19:29:26  <ChrisH_> hey, my bot doesn't do anything magical either, pretty straightforward stuff, but I've found ways to do it fast and I know how to tweek it to get the desired behavior
2011-12-05T19:29:48  <BenJackson> (Kuhn Munkres is the O(n^3) version of the naive Hungarian O(n^4) maximum matching)
2011-12-05T19:30:03  <BenJackson> ChrisH: same here
2011-12-05T19:30:04  <a1k0n> yeah.  i honestly don't feel like spending the time to tweak it anymore, but here i am in irc blabbing about it

2011-12-05T19:30:58  <BenJackson> even in the edge conditions I'm bad at like low food
2011-12-05T19:31:18  <BenJackson> so my next goal is to resubmit and win like 6 in a row
2011-12-05T19:31:18  <ChrisH_> that will improve your mu and skill, which is a good thing
2011-12-05T19:31:48  <ChrisH_> low food is very hard IMHO
2011-12-05T19:32:04  <BenJackson> yeah, low food is the main diff for my V10 vs V9

2011-12-05T19:32:22  <BenJackson> until my tuned bot decisively beat even a fleet of V9
2011-12-05T19:32:26  <a1k0n> do you count up food over time and adjust accordingly?

2011-12-05T19:33:18  <a1k0n> true.  i don't bother.
2011-12-05T19:33:44  <BenJackson> mainly I had screwed up my defense to be more reliant on spawning ants
2011-12-05T19:33:52  <a1k0n> ah yes
2011-12-05T19:34:01  <BenJackson> so when they didn't I just wandered away
2011-12-05T19:34:16  <BenJackson> my thory was that I could eat more food faster than I could send an ant back
2011-12-05T19:34:23  <antimatroid> hehe
2011-12-05T19:34:27  <antimatroid> i considered doing that and went nope
2011-12-05T19:34:35  <ChrisH_> yeah, my bot could be vunlerable that way as well, but since low food is rare enough it hasn't hurt me too much

2011-12-05T20:02:53  <Anilm3>  are you compressing on to a zip file?
2011-12-05T20:07:56  <arscan> yeah
2011-12-05T20:07:59  <arscan> strangest thing
2011-12-05T20:08:10  <bugnuts> arscan is this from linux or windows?
2011-12-05T20:08:19  <arscan> zipping in windows
2011-12-05T20:08:34  <arscan> i was able to zip up the starter package and upload and that worked
2011-12-05T20:08:48  <arscan> but when i zipped up my version that's what it gave me
2011-12-05T20:10:11  <bugnuts> do you have any file names?
2011-12-05T20:10:29  <bugnuts> file name with possible illegal characters for a linkx file
2011-12-05T20:11:52  <arscan> hm, nothing that looks very suspicious
2011-12-05T20:12:05  <bugnuts> on linux you can do unzip -lv file.zip
2011-12-05T20:12:20  <arscan> just to test it out?
2011-12-05T20:12:21  <bugnuts> or unzip -t file.zip and get a bunch of diagnostics
2011-12-05T20:12:26  <arscan> cool
2011-12-05T20:12:28  <arscan> i'll give that a shot
2011-12-05T20:12:42  <bugnuts> don't know if windows unzip has the same flags or not
2011-12-05T20:14:32  <arscan> "No errors dettected in compressed data of zippy.zip"
2011-12-05T20:15:08  <arscan> that error is only from not being able to unzip, as far as you know?
2011-12-05T20:16:35  <bugnuts> I don't know really you could ask an admin or look in the source aichallenge/worker/worker.py
2011-12-05T20:16:42  <arscan> yep
2011-12-05T20:16:45  <arscan> i'll take a look
2011-12-05T20:16:47  <arscan> thanks for your help

2011-12-05T20:19:20  <bugnuts> sounds like there must be a problem on the server side  worker.py is unchanged since oct 26.

2011-12-05T20:49:01  <aarossig> amstan: can't live without alt+clicking a window now, ever since you showed it to me
2011-12-05T20:49:16  <pguillory> started with diffusion, threw it out and rewrote using BFS (my last submission), then threw it out and rewrote again with something else
2011-12-05T20:49:29  <BenJackson> I just realized I must be beating _flag on aichallenge.org because he's not in thet op 4
2011-12-05T20:49:40  <BenJackson> but due to early conditioning on fluxid I still think of A as beating my ass :)
2011-12-05T20:50:01  <amstan> pguillory: isn't diffusion better for going toward groups of more food? doesn't BFS ignore the food quantity and just goes for closest?
2011-12-05T20:50:06  <BenJackson> _flag: it's like with dogs:  you've established early dominance
2011-12-05T20:50:20  <_flag> BenJackson: I keep resubmitting mine
2011-12-05T20:50:29  <_flag> I'm fairly confident I'm still at least top 3
2011-12-05T20:50:58  <pguillory> amstan: yes and yes, but there's more to it
2011-12-05T20:51:07  <BenJackson> too bad no one made that top-20-mu list before my late losing streak
2011-12-05T20:53:33  <pguillory> diffusion handles groups of food well but that's about it, otherwise i found it to have all the advantages of bfs but requiring more computation and not working over long distance

2011-12-05T20:57:04  <pguillory> BFS doesn't help with distribution though, getting ants to spread out efficiently
2011-12-05T21:00:20  <pguillory> my opening game with BFS was crap, like in aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=165974 look at how far behind i get between turns 50 and 100 because BFS is sending bursts of ants at the nearest thing
2011-12-05T21:05:00  <BenJackson> yeah, I had to give that up after V7
2011-12-05T21:05:14  <BenJackson> if it got randomly distributed by some other means it did ok
2011-12-05T21:05:20  <BenJackson> if it ever got clumpy it never de-clumped
2011-12-05T21:06:38  <TwistedLogic> i currently have the same problem with BFS. my ants just trail each other and not spreading over the map
2011-12-05T21:07:12  <TwistedLogic> i might implement something like that described by a1k0n
2011-12-05T21:07:23  <BenJackson> I kept bfs as informational
2011-12-05T21:07:29  <BenJackson> but now I choose moves more globally
2011-12-05T21:07:41  <BenJackson> actually I'm rewriting the bfs code right now to be more powerful
2011-12-05T21:07:50  <TwistedLogic> BFS is only good in mazes
2011-12-05T21:08:19  <TwistedLogic> but not in randomwalk or cellmazes
2011-12-05T21:08:35  <Anilm3> TwistedLogic: what did a1k0n describe?

2011-12-05T21:15:03  <roflmao> I think more people use normal form

2011-12-05T21:46:37  <pguillory> it does have speed problems, but it lets you get close enough to C speed where it counts

2011-12-05T21:48:41  <pguillory> it's in a sweet spot, close enough to python/ruby in terms of convenience, close enough to C in speed
2011-12-05T21:49:16  <pguillory> no way i'll ever write another line of C or C++ if go is an option

2011-12-05T21:54:40  <bugnuts> I don't think there is really any reason go can't be as fast as C (discounting the GC and bounds checking).

2011-12-05T22:02:49  <ChrisH_> regarding comments about BFS 30 minutes ago: my bot has two ways to move ants, combat logic and Djikstra's algorithm, which for most of my ants is really just BFS because most of my movement costs are 1. I wouldn't blame BFS for ants clumping together, I would say it's just a naive use of BFS.
2011-12-05T22:03:40  <bugnuts> I would try and grab an admin I think janzert and McLeopold are the server guys but amstan might be able to help too
2011-12-05T22:03:55  <TwistedLogic> i've added the option to not move in my bot and it doesn't move at the first turn. i was just using the 4 directions before. now the highest score at the first turn is the option not to move. so the ant just sits there in the hill. lol. need to debug this one

2011-12-05T22:12:55  <ChrisH_> rmmh: I have made very heavy use of gopprof
2011-12-05T22:13:08  <amstan> can anyone tell me when submissions worked last?
2011-12-05T22:13:29  <ChrisH_> my bot wouldn't have time to hardly anything if i didn't have that tool to find the slow spots and tune them up
2011-12-05T22:13:41  <ChrisH_> to *do* hardly anthing
2011-12-05T22:13:46  <ChrisH_> gah

2011-12-05T22:14:11  <Friblurks> mine failed at 	Dec 6th 2:55am so probably some time before that :P
2011-12-05T22:14:14  <bugnuts> I wrote a lot of benchmark and test things and use gotest a lot.

2011-12-05T22:16:08  <ChrisH_> amstan: this one was with 4 hours: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=483
2011-12-05T22:16:20  <amstan> i could try restarting the workers
2011-12-05T22:17:00  <BenJackson> maybe someone ran your instances out of space by writing huge files?
2011-12-05T22:17:10  <amstan> maybe
2011-12-05T22:18:27  <ChrisH_> well, i've got bot improvements to make, so IRC distractions must go
2011-12-05T22:18:44  <BenJackson> dude, multiple windows
2011-12-05T22:18:45  <BenJackson> ;-)
2011-12-05T22:19:21  <ChrisH_> that's not the problem, my brain doesn't have multiple pathways for coding and IRC though
2011-12-05T22:19:40  <ChrisH_> I'm single core for sure.
2011-12-05T22:19:48  <ChrisH_> ;)

2011-12-05T22:25:53  <amstan> ok
2011-12-05T22:25:56  <amstan> restarted workers
2011-12-05T22:25:59  <amstan> hopefully it'll be better
2011-12-05T22:26:24  <BenJackson> a1k0n: your bot doesn't build with your makefile
2011-12-05T22:26:30  <BenJackson> so if it's under ifdef it won't debug
2011-12-05T22:29:41  <Friblurks> it worked, my new version is ready to play
2011-12-05T22:30:06  <a1k0n> i know, i put the defines in a header
