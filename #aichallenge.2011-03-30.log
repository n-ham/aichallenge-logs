2011-03-30T00:00:24  <nesquik> could you point me to it?

2011-03-30T01:17:18  <sigh> Frontier: don't make people run jars unless they can't do it any other way
2011-03-30T01:18:34  <Frontier> sigh: what is bad about them?
2011-03-30T01:18:36  <sigh> html visualiser is so much easier, especially when I'm doing dev by sshing to a different machine
2011-03-30T01:19:26  <sigh> with html, I can just serve up the webpage and access it local browser :)
2011-03-30T01:19:26  <Frontier> sigh: can you explain your use case a little bit? I never used the html visualizer in the last contest, only ShowGame.jar
2011-03-30T01:20:14  <sigh> I worked from my laptop, but ssh into my desktop which is a much more powerful machine to actually do dev and run the thing
2011-03-30T01:20:15  <Frontier> sigh: If you run your own webserver, you can probably set up php as well and run the official visualizer.php
2011-03-30T01:20:26  <sigh> eh? webserver?
2011-03-30T01:20:33  <sigh> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
2011-03-30T01:20:42  <Frontier> oic ^^
2011-03-30T01:21:15  <sigh> even when I'm working on the same machine that's what I do
2011-03-30T01:21:17  <Frontier> now how would you get the replay into the html?
2011-03-30T01:22:20  <sigh> I haven't looked at your visualiser yet... the one in the viewer directory is just hard coded :P
2011-03-30T01:23:04  <Frontier> what do you mean by hard coded? if you cannot change it, it doesn't work :o)
2011-03-30T01:23:45  <Frontier> Does it load a replay from a predefined http location?
2011-03-30T01:23:59  <sigh> no, just local fike
2011-03-30T01:24:00  <sigh> *file
2011-03-30T01:24:12  <sigh> 0.stream :P
2011-03-30T01:24:29  <Frontier> html cannot read local files or did I miss something?
2011-03-30T01:25:20  <sigh> hmm... lemme check... it might be an artifact of the fact that I'm serving up the entire dir
2011-03-30T01:25:21  <Frontier> but anyway, via http that would be possible using a GET request on that same file
2011-03-30T01:25:58  <Frontier> i guess that is what McLeopold is doing. I saw a GET somewhere in his code.
2011-03-30T01:26:13  <sigh> ah yes it uses $.get('0.stream',..)
2011-03-30T01:27:33  <sigh> basically my set up is that I have `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` running on that directory, and I simply go to http://localhost:8000/viewer.html
2011-03-30T01:27:34  <Frontier> It would be easy to add a 'reload' button to the visualizer.jar, that fetches a new replay from your simple http server. I had that in mind anyway to avoid the VM load times
2011-03-30T01:27:48  <janzert> python -m SimpleHTTPServer is starting a local (very simple) webserver so you don't have to deal with the local file restrictions
2011-03-30T01:27:57  <sigh> for the html, you just refresh the browser
2011-03-30T01:28:22  <Frontier> same thing, yes
2011-03-30T01:28:43  <Frontier> you dont restart the browser, you just refresh
2011-03-30T01:30:34  <sigh> even without SimpleHTTPServer you should still be able to do $.get('0.stream',...) if you are just looking at localhost
2011-03-30T01:30:49  <sigh> I just have that setup because I'm not always looking up localhsot
2011-03-30T01:30:51  <sigh> *localhost
2011-03-30T01:31:28  <Frontier> localhost doesn't exist when you don't run a server on it :p
2011-03-30T01:31:51  <janzert> yeah, Frontier is referring to using file:// urls
2011-03-30T01:31:55  <sigh> sorry, I meant when you are looking at file:///../viewer.html
2011-03-30T01:32:48  <sigh> if you can view that, then file:///.../0.stream is just as valid
2011-03-30T01:33:08  <janzert> any local file request is considered a cross site request for javascript and is not allowed to access the content of any such request
2011-03-30T01:33:14  <Frontier> sigh: I think browsers have 'same-origin' restrictions in place there.
2011-03-30T01:33:31  <sigh> does it? ok
2011-03-30T01:33:43  <Frontier> file:// urls are genrally considered NOT to be same-origin
2011-03-30T01:35:14  <Frontier> loading http(s) urls into the visualizer works, the question is: would a simple 'f5 to refresh' be ok or are there other reasons not to run a jar?
2011-03-30T01:35:39  <Frontier> (considering setting up simpleHTTPServer to be at least as complicated as installing Java 6)
2011-03-30T01:36:38  <sigh> hang on... viewer.html is allowed to access the local javascript files?
2011-03-30T01:36:45  * Frontier takes a note to collect use cases before starting actual work
2011-03-30T01:36:49  <sigh> or whatever
2011-03-30T01:37:07  <sigh> it must be
2011-03-30T01:37:08  <Frontier> sigh: yes, but the special XmlHTTPRequest is not
2011-03-30T01:37:10  <janzert> Frontier: except they're going to need install python for the engine currently anyway right?
2011-03-30T01:37:30  <sigh> in which case write the replay to a .js file which stores the json to a variable
2011-03-30T01:37:34  <sigh> global variable
2011-03-30T01:37:36  <janzert> at which point the SimpleHTTPServer setup is a matter of telling them the right commandline to use
2011-03-30T01:38:19  <sigh> I think if you write the .js then it doesn't need SimpleHTTPServer, and works like the old planetwars one
2011-03-30T01:38:20  <Frontier> apt-get install sun-jre6 , come on ^^
2011-03-30T01:38:58  <Frontier> so the old planetwars visualizer loaded a js file?
2011-03-30T01:39:12  <janzert> yes, it's not a big thing. just certainly no easier than the other way
2011-03-30T01:39:24  <sigh> sort of, it wrote the visualiser file itself
2011-03-30T01:39:47  <Frontier> the html file WROTE a js file?
2011-03-30T01:39:57  * Frontier is puzzled
2011-03-30T01:39:58  <sigh> no, the engine which generated the replay
2011-03-30T01:40:04  <sigh> generated a html file
2011-03-30T01:40:29  <sigh> for example in your case the engine would output offline.html
2011-03-30T01:41:26  <sigh> (or it injected it into an existing template, can't remember)
2011-03-30T01:41:59  <Frontier> I see. Well, I'm not sure now, if I should work on that or let the engine write the replay into a html template.
2011-03-30T01:42:27  <Frontier> I sounds more like an output option to me, like 'export this file as pdf'
2011-03-30T01:42:31  <antimatroid> damnit
2011-03-30T01:42:38  <antimatroid> my physics lecturer gives out bonus marks
2011-03-30T01:42:51  <antimatroid> that means we need to put additional effort into assignments :\
2011-03-30T01:43:28  <sigh> Frontier: actually, in planet wars you did something like this: engine | create_visualiser
2011-03-30T01:43:53  <Frontier> lol, never heard of that option. where did you get this create_visualizer script?
2011-03-30T01:43:58  <sigh> so engine output the replay, and create_visuliser did the messy stuff (names different of course)
2011-03-30T01:45:39  <sigh> hang on
2011-03-30T01:45:54  <sigh> I will find the actual code instead of making up stuff
2011-03-30T01:47:05  <janzert> didn't deal with the stuff people were using client side much but all I remember from planetwars is something like "plagame.jar .... | showgame.jar"
2011-03-30T01:47:47  <sigh> janzert: yeah, you could substitute showgame..jar with one which created a html version and opened it in your browser
2011-03-30T01:47:56  <janzert> ahh
2011-03-30T01:48:30  <sigh> https://github.com/DanielVF/Planet-Wars-Canvas-Visualizer/blob/master/visualize_localy.py
2011-03-30T01:48:34  <sigh> there
2011-03-30T01:49:19  <sigh> it took index.php as a template and created generated.htm
2011-03-30T01:49:47  <sigh> and launched it in your browser
2011-03-30T01:50:26  <sigh> (personally I commented out the webbrowser.open line and just used SimpleHTTPServer, but that wasn't a requirement)
2011-03-30T01:50:29  <janzert> makes sense since that's the way it worked on the server too
2011-03-30T01:50:35  <sigh> yup
2011-03-30T01:52:41  *** Kingpin13 is now known as Kingpin13|away
2011-03-30T01:52:50  <sigh> Frontier: you still there?
2011-03-30T01:52:51  <Frontier> sigh: now we load replays via GET request, but with a different template it still works
2011-03-30T01:53:55  <sigh> I'll let you handle it ^_^
2011-03-30T01:54:06  <Frontier> visualizer = new Visualizer(...);

2011-03-30T01:54:57  <Frontier> I don't get to wash my dishes today it seems ^^
2011-03-30T01:55:03  <sigh> :)
2011-03-30T01:55:13  <McLeopold> Is frontier still around?
2011-03-30T01:55:19  <sigh> o_O
2011-03-30T01:55:20  <Frontier> hi McLeopold: pls join the discussion
2011-03-30T01:55:21  <sigh> no
2011-03-30T01:55:28  <sigh> :P
2011-03-30T01:55:37  <McLeopold> Am an in the discussion now?
2011-03-30T01:56:03  <sigh> I was just trying to convince Frontier to allow people to run the html visualiser locally
2011-03-30T01:56:16  <Frontier> We were talking about sigh running the engine on a remote machine via ssh and viewing the replay over a browser
2011-03-30T01:56:20  <McLeopold> So, just some thoughts on the visualizer.  Replay files will be resources on the internet.
2011-03-30T01:56:30  <Frontier> correct
2011-03-30T01:56:36  <McLeopold> An html viewer should be supported.
2011-03-30T01:56:51  <McLeopold> My impression was that the java viewer was only an IE work around.
2011-03-30T01:57:15  <sigh> mine too, but then the offline.html file disappeared :P
2011-03-30T01:57:16  <Frontier> from making it faster on IE emerged a standalone .replay viewer
2011-03-30T01:57:19  <McLeopold> There is no reason to force people to use java or jar files.
2011-03-30T01:57:32  <sigh> that's what I said :D
2011-03-30T01:57:34  <Frontier> but we already force them to use Python
2011-03-30T01:57:41  <McLeopold> That's cool, but we need to give people the js only version.
2011-03-30T01:57:42  <Frontier> same logic I think
2011-03-30T01:58:09  <sigh> less dependencies the better
2011-03-30T01:58:21  <McLeopold> The engine is written as python, but is written to a spec.
2011-03-30T01:59:00  <McLeopold> We should have a java engine for those that want it, but we shouldn't force it.
2011-03-30T01:59:09  <Frontier> ok, you need to help me out a bit here. what should the engine do, what should the html look like to make it easy to use. copy&paste replays seem awkward to me
2011-03-30T01:59:34  <McLeopold> The engine is capable of producing replay and stream formats.
2011-03-30T01:59:53  <sigh> Frontier: for now just do what McLeopold's visualiser does
2011-03-30T02:00:01  <McLeopold> The visualizer should accept those formats from any resource, url, paste, local file, etc...
2011-03-30T02:00:25  <Frontier> no etc, that are all options ;)
2011-03-30T02:00:29  <McLeopold> The java viewer is fine, it just needs to go in a tool package for java users.
2011-03-30T02:00:39  <McLeopold> Someone will think of something else
2011-03-30T02:00:43  <sigh> yup
2011-03-30T02:00:55  <McLeopold> The visualizer needs text, and that is all it should care about.
2011-03-30T02:01:18  <Frontier> McLeopold: Hehe, I don't think it is for Java users only. Everyone can use it until other alternatives emerge
2011-03-30T02:01:22  <McLeopold> The offline.html should just be a tool to help gather the text from various sources and pass it to the visualizer
2011-03-30T02:02:12  <McLeopold> http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/
2011-03-30T02:02:17  <McLeopold> Text is king
2011-03-30T02:02:43  <Frontier> what is that html 3?
2011-03-30T02:03:12  <McLeopold> can you not read html source?
2011-03-30T02:03:28  <Frontier> McLeopold: I think your viewer html is what you want, I don't need to reinvent the wheel.
2011-03-30T02:04:03  <sigh> the downside of viewer.html is that it requires SimpleHTTPServer
2011-03-30T02:04:11  <sigh> but it's better than no HTML visualiser :P
2011-03-30T02:05:35  <McLeopold> restore offline.html, the wheel was already made
2011-03-30T02:06:00  <Frontier> I only have so much time and I would rather ensure the applet runs stable and I get map scrolling and zoom implemented
2011-03-30T02:06:25  <sigh> Frontier: I'll do it then, just put offline.html back and I'll get something working
2011-03-30T02:06:40  <Frontier> It is still in the repo history, isn't it?
2011-03-30T02:06:54  <sigh> ok, fine.. I'll get it back myself :P
2011-03-30T02:07:17  <Frontier> should it go into the viewer folder then, or in a separate tools folder?
2011-03-30T02:08:02  <sigh> why can't it live in the visualiser folder where offline.html used to be?
2011-03-30T02:08:32  <Frontier> People would download a lot of stuff like the java classes to get it working
2011-03-30T02:08:49  <Frontier> although they only need the js files and images
2011-03-30T02:08:53  <sigh> eh?
2011-03-30T02:09:12  <Frontier> but the directory structure changed to make it cleaner to work with from ant
2011-03-30T02:09:15  <sigh> oh, you are talking about the java visualiser?
2011-03-30T02:09:15  <McLeopold> then can we pull the js out of the java package?
2011-03-30T02:09:21  <Frontier> there is js, java and data
2011-03-30T02:09:42  <Frontier> but the offline.html will look for img/... instead of data/img
2011-03-30T02:10:10  <McLeopold> sigh: are you familiar with the visualize_locally.py from the last contest?
2011-03-30T02:10:21  <McLeopold> could we add an option for that in playgame.py?
2011-03-30T02:10:26  <sigh> I pasted it to the channel just before you got here
2011-03-30T02:10:37  <Frontier> McLeopold: The Java version compiles the JS, images and Java into one jar. So I think it belongs together somehow, but we can propably seperate things a bit
2011-03-30T02:10:47  <sigh> McLeopold: that's kind of what I was thinking
2011-03-30T02:10:48  <McLeopold> except maybe it launches the SimpleHTTPServer?
2011-03-30T02:11:28  <sigh> I don't like the idea of it launching anything
2011-03-30T02:11:29  <McLeopold> the ant script can pull from other directories if it needs to
2011-03-30T02:11:46  <Frontier> McLeopold: If you use visualize_locally.py, I could let the ant script zip up a package with the html template to use
2011-03-30T02:12:25  <Frontier> We should provide as many tools as possible on a central download page of ai-contest.com
2011-03-30T02:13:13  <McLeopold> sigh: how come you don't want it to launch things?
2011-03-30T02:13:32  <McLeopold> even if it was an option?
2011-03-30T02:13:56  <sigh> the engine shouldn't launch random processes
2011-03-30T02:14:09  <McLeopold> Not the engine, playgame
2011-03-30T02:14:41  <McLeopold> playgame is just a testing tool, like the offline.html
2011-03-30T02:14:57  <sigh> hmmm... maybe
2011-03-30T02:15:14  <McLeopold> the engine.py is in worker, and doesn't even know anything about ants
2011-03-30T02:15:18  <sigh> in which case it should just run webbrowser.open like visualise_locally.py did
2011-03-30T02:15:42  <McLeopold> yeah, but it would have to write a special html file, which we don't want to do
2011-03-30T02:15:43  * janzert wishes ants didn't depend on stuff in worker
2011-03-30T02:16:05  <McLeopold> janzert: the ants.py is written to an interface of sorts
2011-03-30T02:16:12  <Frontier> who doesn't want to write a html file?
2011-03-30T02:16:15  <McLeopold> other than that, it is completely separate
2011-03-30T02:16:20  <McLeopold> me
2011-03-30T02:16:21  <sigh> McLeopold: what's wrong with the process that planetwars had?
2011-03-30T02:16:40  <janzert> it's just going to make it harder to package it up
2011-03-30T02:16:43  <McLeopold> nothing, I'm just striving for elegance
2011-03-30T02:17:32  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, but easier when we have multiple games going
2011-03-30T02:17:40  <sigh> launching SimpleHTTPServer in the foreground, forcing people to navigate to http://localhost:8000/offline.html
2011-03-30T02:17:43  <sigh> is not elegent
2011-03-30T02:17:47  * janzert doesn't believe in multiple games ;)
2011-03-30T02:18:21  <Frontier> *sigh* another bike shed :p   no offense, i start of a few myself
2011-03-30T02:18:22  <janzert> or the 'interface' could just be a convention all the games conformed to
2011-03-30T02:18:31  <McLeopold> sigh: okay, maybe, but it's more elegant that writing a temp file to the same location everytime
2011-03-30T02:18:50  <sigh> the user doesn't care
2011-03-30T02:18:54  <Frontier> McLeopold: think PDF exporter ;)
2011-03-30T02:18:55  <McLeopold> janzert: that's the idea
2011-03-30T02:19:20  <janzert> well with that idea the game doesn't import anything from worker :)
2011-03-30T02:19:31  <sigh> all the user knows is that there shell is taken out of action and that they have to manually navigate to some url
2011-03-30T02:19:32  <McLeopold> sigh: ultimately, it would be nice for a user testing locally to treat his system as a separate tcp server
2011-03-30T02:19:59  <McLeopold> which is why having playgame.py manage replay files and an html interface for browsing them seems elegant
2011-03-30T02:20:24  <sigh> that's fine if you can set it up so that someone who doesn't know python, html, or anything about the web can run it
2011-03-30T02:20:58  <sigh> McLeopold: either way, it is not usable
2011-03-30T02:20:59  <Frontier> McLeopold: In that case we are close to a full ai-contest server installation
2011-03-30T02:21:15  <janzert> http://www.boingboing.net/2011/03/29/machete-shooting-rif.html completely off topic but...sweet :)
2011-03-30T02:21:16  <McLeopold> what's not usable?
2011-03-30T02:22:30  <McLeopold> sigh: I don't think I followed your train of thought...
2011-03-30T02:23:49  <Frontier> I have a feeling browsing replays is a nice feature, but you are making it more complicated than neccesary for most users. Look at how simple the starter packs are
2011-03-30T02:24:29  <Frontier> Ideally you just unzip and run a command (or pipe the output of the engine into it)
2011-03-30T02:24:44  <McLeopold> I just don't want to make it more complicated for those that can cope with good tools.  Obviously we want sane defaults, but that doesn't mean we should limit ourselves.
2011-03-30T02:25:06  <sigh> McLeopold: the only thing that you have a problem with is writing a html file?
2011-03-30T02:25:45  <McLeopold> Yeah, because I think the replay files should remain text so that you can easily pass them around to different tools
2011-03-30T02:26:02  <Frontier> McLeopold: again, think PDF
2011-03-30T02:26:17  <Frontier> it is an export option, not an format to be parsed
2011-03-30T02:26:23  <sigh> the replays were plain text in planetwars
2011-03-30T02:26:26  <McLeopold> So, if the replay files was written somewhere for storage, *and* a temp html files was written, that would be ok.  I just think we could do slightly better.
2011-03-30T02:26:38  <sigh> it was visualise_locally which created html
2011-03-30T02:27:21  <sigh> either way, if you insist I would rather visualise_locally.py so SimpleHTTPServer stuff, I still think it makes it more effort on the user's part than planetwars was
2011-03-30T02:27:26  <Frontier> McLeopold: for me that option seems ok. You tell visualize_locally to keep a copy of the original data somehwere and let it write the html
2011-03-30T02:27:59  <McLeopold> Okay, a http server could be separated from playgame, but both could assume some type of local storage structure.
2011-03-30T02:28:18  <sigh> also automatically running SimpleHTTPServer hijacks the port, and assumes that the user is not doing anything else with it

2011-03-30T04:09:18  <woudshoo> hi all, just curious, but what is the rationale for showing water only the first time it is seen?  It does not seem to add anything to the gameplay.
2011-03-30T04:09:51  <sigh> woudshoo: reduce the amount of data that needs to be transfered
2011-03-30T04:10:16  <sigh> that's really the only issue there
2011-03-30T04:11:10  <woudshoo> sigh: I see, 5000 water * 8 bytes can add up
2011-03-30T04:11:16  <sigh> yup
2011-03-30T04:11:41  <sigh> and it is trivial for a bot to keep track of it
2011-03-30T04:12:51  <woudshoo> Yes, it is trivial to keep track, I just started playing with implementing a bot and that is definitely not the hard part.
2011-03-30T04:13:37  <woudshoo> Also, I just updated yesterday, and the offline.html viewer is gone :-(  It looked cool eventhough the playgame did not generate output that could be parsed by offline.html
2011-03-30T04:15:12  <sigh> woudshoo: it will be back, don't worry :)
2011-03-30T04:17:06  <sigh> for now, you can just: git checkout b08cc7 ants/visualizer/offline.html
2011-03-30T04:18:23  <woudshoo> sigh: thank you, now I just should write a script to wrap the 0.replay in the format offline.html expects.  (Or fix/change playgame.py, but I don't know any python)
2011-03-30T04:19:09  <sigh> woudshoo: yeah, we'll get around to implementing that, everything is still in dev

2011-03-30T04:30:56  <woudshoo> aerique: Just a question, on MacOSX (my laptop) I regularly have that my bot times out during the setup face because loading the sbcl core/image takes too long with a cold cache.  Is that a dange in the real competition?
2011-03-30T04:31:53  <aerique> woudshoo: no, we always use compiled bots on the game server (exactly because of the problem you mentioned)
2011-03-30T04:31:54  <Frontier> I think the timer is set to 3 seconds for the warm up phase.
2011-03-30T04:32:05  <aerique> woudshoo: (at least for CL that is)
2011-03-30T04:33:07  <woudshoo> aerique:  I use locally the compiled bot.  The resulting executable is about 40MB and if I run it the first time, it can take more than 3 seconds.  (Somehow my Mac is sometimes really slow with disk access.)  But if the experience of planetwars was that it is not a problem I will not worry about it.
2011-03-30T04:33:31  <aerique> woudshoo: ah ok.  it has indeed not been a problem with planet wars
2011-03-30T04:33:39  <sigh> woudshoo: for local you can extend the time using the --loadtime option to playgame.py

2011-03-30T06:48:47  <contestbot> Stocha: Frontier was last seen in #aichallenge 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 21 seconds ago: <Frontier> So in the long run you can use the Java visualizer or the Python script which will generate a html page embedding the replay
2011-03-30T06:49:02  <Stocha> @later tell Frontier i am colorblind yes

2011-03-30T07:13:09  <sigh> @later tell Frontier how do I start the visualiser off in expanded mode
2011-03-30T07:13:09  <contestbot> sigh: Yes master!
2011-03-30T07:20:18  <sigh> @later tell Frontier, nevermind figured it out, but now I need to know why you have that annoying "Accept the next dialog to have colorized button graphics." message
2011-03-30T07:20:18  <contestbot> sigh: Yes master!
2011-03-30T07:20:50  <Frontier> sigh: start it in expanded mode? expand it and then click on save... theoretically
2011-03-30T07:21:04  <sigh> Frontier: nah, I figured it out
2011-03-30T07:21:13  <sigh> anyway... why is that security message there?
2011-03-30T07:21:16  <sigh> can I take it out?
2011-03-30T07:21:31  <sigh> it's in ImageManager.js
2011-03-30T07:21:39  <Frontier> You can tell Firefox to always accept.
2011-03-30T07:22:16  <sigh> how?
2011-03-30T07:22:16  <Frontier> If you ignore it the buttons for fog of war will all be the same color. I did not put that there without reason. A shame of you to think so ^^
2011-03-30T07:22:28  <Frontier> Isn't there a checkbox?

2011-03-30T07:22:34  <sigh> I just get the alert
2011-03-30T07:22:38  <Frontier> huh?
2011-03-30T07:22:45  <Frontier> but you use firefox?
2011-03-30T07:22:48  <sigh> and it just says "OK"
2011-03-30T07:22:49  <sigh> yes
2011-03-30T07:22:50  <Frontier> which version?
2011-03-30T07:23:11  <Frontier> 4?
2011-03-30T07:23:14  <sigh> Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16
2011-03-30T07:23:21  <sigh> 3.6.16
2011-03-30T07:23:58  <Frontier> I'm now on windows, where I don't have the same arsenal of browsers installed, but that sure looks strange to me.
2011-03-30T07:24:09  <sigh> I just get the alert and that's it
2011-03-30T07:24:10  <Frontier> Are the buttons colorized btw?
2011-03-30T07:24:16  <sigh> no
2011-03-30T07:24:29  <Frontier> so it fails silently without asking you hmm.
2011-03-30T07:24:56  <Stocha> there is an expended mode ? (maybe i have an older version anyway)
2011-03-30T07:25:02  <Stocha> Can you draw grid also ?
2011-03-30T07:25:18  <Frontier> ok, you can temporarily remove the alert. I'll have to see why it doesn't popup the Firefox security screen next
2011-03-30T07:25:43  <Frontier> Stocha: sure, I have that on my list.
2011-03-30T07:26:57  <Frontier> I'm just now in the annoying situation that I didn't implement multithreading right in the applet. And that's no task that I love to work on, but it is the most important since IE users will currently get a white screen :p
2011-03-30T07:28:24  <Frontier> offline.html isn't even prepared for IE. I was actually glad to dump that ugly copy&paste thing ^^

2011-03-30T07:37:39  <Frontier1> Stocha: An applet has to start an addition thread if it wants to do anything on its own basically
2011-03-30T07:37:46  <Frontier1> *additional
2011-03-30T07:39:27  <Frontier1> The browser just calls init() once and then start()/stop() whenever it becomes visible/invisible to let the applet know that it would waste system ressources if it keeps running its animation thread.

2011-03-30T07:47:55  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold ok, it's only 5x faster
2011-03-30T07:47:55  <contestbot> sigh: As you wish.
2011-03-30T07:48:09  <Frontier> sigh: were you aware that the jar visualizer can download the 0.replay from http://localhost/ ? Just out of curiosity :)
2011-03-30T07:48:34  <sigh> Frontier: ok?
2011-03-30T07:48:48  <sigh> how does that help the html visualiser
2011-03-30T07:49:27  <Frontier> I'm just saying one does not need a html visualizer just to get a replay from a remote server
2011-03-30T07:50:01  <sigh> sure
2011-03-30T07:51:38  <sigh> janzert: ok, it's only 5x faster... I was read the wrong column in the profiler output :(
2011-03-30T07:52:31  <sigh> janzert: in my defence, before the thing wasn't calling any functions so the total time and cumulative time were the same...
2011-03-30T07:52:39  <Stocha> i like the html visualizer. Don't make it so that people have to use it. But those who want should be able to
2011-03-30T07:53:19  <Stocha> for example people may want to share games on pastebin or by email.
2011-03-30T07:53:31  <Stocha> especially now that stuff is all messy.
2011-03-30T07:53:45  <Frontier> I wanted to force the java visualizer on all of you, harhar. but i made up my mind now. if you prefer the glitches that come with html on a local file system and ie not displaying anything, its ok for me
2011-03-30T07:54:09  <Stocha> but we'll have both option right ?
2011-03-30T07:54:18  <Frontier> Stocha: sure
2011-03-30T07:54:24  <Stocha> :)
2011-03-30T07:55:04  <phire> what local html glitches?
2011-03-30T07:55:40  <Frontier> The specs don't allow any access to files from within scripts on a local filesystem.
2011-03-30T07:55:45  <sigh> Frontier: either way, java 1.6 wont work on my laptop :P
2011-03-30T07:55:45  <Stocha> phire : they said the score is fair. Your bot was more involved into the game, that's all.
2011-03-30T07:56:08  <Stocha> Mine which wiped out the three other only barely won.
2011-03-30T07:56:11  <Frontier> sigh: if you mean performance wise, I think they sped it up quite a bit compared to Java 1,5
2011-03-30T07:56:25  <sigh> Frontier: no, as in I can't get it
2011-03-30T07:56:47  <phire> Frontier, Base64 encode the external files as data urls
2011-03-30T07:56:56  <Frontier> phire: This comes down to the point where I cannot colorize button graphics for fog of war in strict browsers or automatically load replay files
2011-03-30T07:57:56  <phire> Stocha, I guess we better design our bots to aim for a high score, rather than destroy all ants
2011-03-30T07:58:06  <Frontier> phire: You are right, that would work. But how long can an url become? 409600 chars?
2011-03-30T07:58:11  *** boegel <boegel!~boegel@ca60c171.ugent.be> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-03-30T07:58:46  <phire> I have seen some massive ones
2011-03-30T07:59:04  <Frontier> A few years back long urls were a problem. They may now work cross-browser.
2011-03-30T07:59:11  <phire> I think Internet Explorer has some limits, but not other broswers
2011-03-30T08:00:16  <phire> IE7 doesn't support data URIs at all
2011-03-30T08:00:22  <Frontier> Microsoft should just give up on IE and forcedly uninstall that non-standard-compliant browser on everyones machine, so we can finally have an open web with all the new stuff.
2011-03-30T08:00:28  <phire> and IE8 has a 32KB limitation
2011-03-30T08:00:42  <Frontier> lol, see. we might just hit that
2011-03-30T08:01:14  <Frontier> our replays are in the range of hundrets of KB
2011-03-30T08:01:53  <phire> can we not just embed the replays directly into the html
2011-03-30T08:01:56  <phire> they are just text
2011-03-30T08:02:15  <Frontier> that is what sigh is working on
2011-03-30T08:02:32  <sigh> it's there in the replay branch
2011-03-30T08:02:57  <sigh> I'll merge it in if I get approval from you and McLeopold
2011-03-30T08:03:12  <Frontier> where do the files go? how will the package be released?
2011-03-30T08:03:20  <sigh> I dunno, you decide
2011-03-30T08:04:05  <Stocha> phire : i don't think it's that a big problem at low levels.
2011-03-30T08:04:18  <Frontier> oh, then... make a zip file from it, like the starter bots. you can put the source files in visualizer/<some recognizable name> if you want
2011-03-30T08:04:27  <Stocha> phire just do good looking bots, and hope for the best :)
2011-03-30T08:04:41  <phire> Whats the scoring criteria anyway?
2011-03-30T08:04:54  <Stocha> i'm not sure they got that settledyet
2011-03-30T08:05:04  <Stocha> i think they go for ant killed at the moment.
2011-03-30T08:05:05  <Frontier> Either you write a Makefile, or I'll add a section to the ant script if you place it in visualizer/
2011-03-30T08:06:00  <Stocha> I'm a supporter of number of ants at end of game as it stand now. Not knowing what fighting rule will make it live. But either way i think number of ants is safer.
2011-03-30T08:06:35  <Stocha> If then you have to make the game 1vs1 for it to make any sense i won't be the one complaining.
2011-03-30T08:07:18  <CIA-90> aichallenge: sigh replay * r1f195a9 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Move visualize_locally/py into visualizer dir - http://bit.ly/i1E8Gj
2011-03-30T08:07:30  <sigh> Frontier: it's all in the visualizer directory now
2011-03-30T08:07:34  <Frontier> sigh: Personally I don't emphasize easy collection of the files from the repo, but a zip download on the final web site.
2011-03-30T08:07:37  <Frontier> kk
2011-03-30T08:07:51  <phire> number of ants at end will probally lead to bots racing out to try and grab as much territory as possible then defending it for the rest of the game
2011-03-30T08:08:14  <Frontier> ah python variadic arguments :)
2011-03-30T08:08:27  <sigh> hmm?
2011-03-30T08:10:07  <sigh> Frontier: what about python?
2011-03-30T08:10:33  <Frontier> it concatenates paths with a simple (parta, partb, partc)

2011-03-30T08:11:06  <sigh> haha
2011-03-30T08:11:44  <Frontier> or "parta + File.separator + partb + File.separator + partc", you have the choice after all
2011-03-30T08:12:12  <sigh> but yeah, please change anything in visualize_locally.py or replay.html.template to how you think it should work
2011-03-30T08:12:39  <sigh> as I said, I just wanted something that worked
2011-03-30T08:12:59  <Frontier> sigh: btw, meta data is not required if you don't add playernames or anything relevant.
2011-03-30T08:13:17  <sigh> oh ok
2011-03-30T08:13:59  <Frontier> I'll look at it at some point and see if I would change anything. Otherwise never stop a running system
2011-03-30T08:14:07  <sigh> ideally, you and McLeopold would agree on a json format and the engine/worker would output that
2011-03-30T08:14:33  <Frontier> sigh: I don't know about your disk space, but I prefer to keep the file size small.
2011-03-30T08:14:56  <sigh> how does that relate?
2011-03-30T08:15:38  <Frontier> I once calculated the difference in file size with the streaming format back then and it was way bigger.
2011-03-30T08:16:15  <sigh> but we are not using the streaming format for this?
2011-03-30T08:16:38  <Frontier> No, but honestly. How would you put the storage format into good json?
2011-03-30T08:16:56  <sigh> what? you are already trying to put it into json
2011-03-30T08:17:00  <Frontier> It is just strings of data for each ant
2011-03-30T08:17:48  <Frontier> When we thought about adding meta data to the replays, JSON was the best future proof solution.
2011-03-30T08:18:19  <Frontier> It doesn't change the replay file itself, but wraps it transparently.
2011-03-30T08:18:24  <sigh> sure... and the worker also does the same thing, only thing is that the format in visualiser is different from the engine
2011-03-30T08:18:39  <Frontier> ?
2011-03-30T08:19:01  <Frontier> ok i get it
2011-03-30T08:19:30  <sigh> the json that McLeopold implemented in the engine does not match what you implemented in your visualiser
2011-03-30T08:19:36  <sigh> and you guys should get that sorted out
2011-03-30T08:20:00  <Frontier> We have the wiki with the specs, what could have gone wrong?
2011-03-30T08:20:20  <sigh> I dunno, all I know is that it is different
2011-03-30T08:20:53  <Frontier> I what way?
2011-03-30T08:21:07  <Frontier> different meta data?
2011-03-30T08:21:40  <sigh> and different key names
2011-03-30T08:21:44  <Frontier> that is no problem, the visualizer just takes what it understands and ignores the rest. and mcleopold can add anything that might be of use for amstan or others
2011-03-30T08:22:06  <Frontier> different names for the same thing is bad indeed -.-
2011-03-30T08:22:31  <Frontier> English is not my native language, so he might have had better names.

2011-03-30T08:38:17  <Frontier> Stocha: good idea. I'll make it an easter egg ;).
2011-03-30T08:42:46  <antimatroid> well i'll see how that goes..
2011-03-30T08:42:58  <antimatroid> just shot an email off the the mentor guys for the gambit gsoc stuff
2011-03-30T08:43:01  <Frontier> Stocha: I have a worker thread that reads a queue with the javascript timer events that can expire any time. If i have some immediate stuff to do inbetween, like an image is fully loaded and triggers the onload function, I interrupt this thread (which is waiting for a timer to expire). Unfortunatly I use that thread to download the replay as well. This is a blocking socket operation which is also affected by the interruption. S

2011-03-30T08:44:26  <phire> Question
2011-03-30T08:44:40  <phire> Food is placed by the random number generator, right?
2011-03-30T08:45:06  <phire> and the random number generator is seeded with the system time on startup
2011-03-30T08:45:20  <phire> and the bots are started up at around the same time
2011-03-30T08:45:42  <phire> Is there a security issue there?
2011-03-30T08:45:46  <Frontier> no
2011-03-30T08:46:17  <Frontier> The bots don't know the exact time after all.
2011-03-30T08:46:58  <Frontier> The random number algorithm is too complex in turn to find the seed from a series of output values
2011-03-30T08:46:59  <phire> you blocked the syscall?
2011-03-30T08:47:18  <antimatroid> the bots start after the engine picks the seed
2011-03-30T08:47:23  <Frontier> phire: a few milliseconds difference will result in totally different numbers
2011-03-30T08:47:26  <antimatroid> good luck guessing the exact time the engine got it
2011-03-30T08:47:48  <phire> but you can brute force it if you know the likely range the seed time is in
2011-03-30T08:48:03  <Frontier> hmm
2011-03-30T08:48:33  <antimatroid> what if we use that seed to compute a number of other seeds to generate, and use those seeds to generate each suceeding seed?
2011-03-30T08:48:36  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-30T08:48:37  <Frontier> there could be a salt value in the db in the final compo
2011-03-30T08:48:37  <antimatroid> yo dog
2011-03-30T08:49:12  <phire> well, probally best to just grab a number out of urandom and use that to seed the prng
2011-03-30T08:50:28  <Frontier> doesn't bot location influence food spawning?
2011-03-30T08:50:48  <phire> and the layout of the map?
2011-03-30T08:51:40  <Frontier> so there is really no advantage in knowing the random seed as long as you dont know the map

2011-03-30T08:53:11  <phire> if you could quickly scout the map
2011-03-30T08:54:07  <Frontier> you cant -.-
2011-03-30T08:54:24  <Frontier> you move at 1 square per turn
2011-03-30T08:54:50  <phire> it also might be possible to determine the map from the behaviour of the PRNG
2011-03-30T08:55:19  <phire> but I think it becomes chicken and egg

2011-03-30T08:55:45  <phire> you don't know the seed without knowing the map, and you don't know the map without knowing the seed
2011-03-30T08:55:54  <Stocha> you have the option of using secure random.
2011-03-30T08:56:00  <Stocha> if things really get that far.
2011-03-30T08:56:17  <Stocha> So far i've found few use of trying to guess the random numbers though.
2011-03-30T08:56:34  <Stocha> You'd probably be better to start with the symmetric things if maps are symmetrics
2011-03-30T08:56:46  <Stocha> Or make your bot stronger in fact.
2011-03-30T08:56:50  <Stocha> that's a huge gain also.
2011-03-30T08:57:04  <Stocha> a bad bot with the whole map divination will still be bad :p
2011-03-30T08:57:26  <Stocha> that becomes a problem if all bot are of same strength though.
2011-03-30T08:58:08  <phire> yes
2011-03-30T08:58:37  <phire> but you don't need to go all the way to a secure random, just use a non-predictable seed
2011-03-30T08:58:46  <Stocha> what will you make an easter egg Frontier. I didn't get it.
2011-03-30T08:59:06  <Stocha> There are plenty of solutions.
2011-03-30T08:59:33  <Stocha> and really marginal trouble at the moment.
2011-03-30T08:59:43  <Stocha> you don't even know the map generation algorithm that will be used now :p
2011-03-30T08:59:59  <phire> lol
2011-03-30T09:00:21  <Stocha> but i like your logic. i would have the same though. wait. i had them.
2011-03-30T09:00:21  <phire> its tempting to just leave it in and see if anyone can exploit it
2011-03-30T09:00:39  <Stocha> yeah.
2011-03-30T09:01:18  <Stocha> but if you look at the game and it become crystal clear the bot already know the game, that might be trouble for your bot also.
2011-03-30T09:01:25  <Stocha> the map
2011-03-30T09:01:37  <Stocha> especially if it is done for all maps.
2011-03-30T09:02:12  <Stocha> so you'll have to try to build a good bot, make it use the known map, and then make use of it in order for that not to be too evident.
2011-03-30T09:02:35  <Stocha> Unless you only want to point out there is security issue.
2011-03-30T09:03:02  <Stocha> it seems marginally important in the whole. unless you can earn money or something.
2011-03-30T09:03:26  <Stocha> Or if it really is easy to hack. Wich i doubt it will.
2011-03-30T09:03:41  <phire> yeah, I think it will be really hard
2011-03-30T09:04:01  <phire> unless map generation is done per round with the same random seed
2011-03-30T09:04:51  <Stocha> still it is good to point that out. Maybe they should make some official statement about it. So the issue won't come again and again :p
2011-03-30T09:05:51  <Stocha> bot location will certainly affect food spawning yes
2011-03-30T09:06:06  <Stocha> so that'll make it much harder to anticipate where food will pop out.
2011-03-30T09:06:31  <Stocha> as will the fact that the bot can add some entropy in general. explicitly or implicitly
2011-03-30T09:06:32  <phire> but it will allow you to determin the locations of the other bots
2011-03-30T09:06:49  <Stocha> i can help.
2011-03-30T09:07:03  <Stocha> but your bot engine will have to be good enougth in the first place.
2011-03-30T09:07:26  <Stocha> so the question is : are you better making the bot strong, or making it know some stuff about the map setting.
2011-03-30T09:07:38  <Stocha> Same goes with cracking map symmetry.
2011-03-30T09:08:05  <Stocha> I have been working on a bot, to see how that is going.
2011-03-30T09:08:21  <Stocha> so far, i wouldn't use full knowledge easilly.
2011-03-30T09:08:29  <Stocha> of course it would help. But not that much.
2011-03-30T09:08:52  <phire> it allows you to get away without scouting as much
2011-03-30T09:08:56  <Stocha> About one week of work should beat the knowledge from where i stand now.
2011-03-30T09:09:05  <Stocha> it allows you to do much.
2011-03-30T09:09:17  <Stocha> but that's for perfect knowledge also.
2011-03-30T09:09:26  <Stocha> and at starting game.
2011-03-30T09:09:34  <Stocha> so it helps, but it's big trouble.
2011-03-30T09:09:42  <Stocha> and maybe not worth it.
2011-03-30T09:09:46  <phire> now that I think about it
2011-03-30T09:09:53  <phire> unlike games like starcraft
2011-03-30T09:09:56  <Stocha> and it might be sanctionned if people find out.
2011-03-30T09:10:01  <phire> scouting isn't excatly expensive
2011-03-30T09:10:06  <Stocha> it is
2011-03-30T09:10:15  <Stocha> it is very expansive at the start of the game.
2011-03-30T09:10:27  <Stocha> every little things matter in the starting phase.
2011-03-30T09:10:42  <Stocha> knowing where food would pop would be huge :p
2011-03-30T09:10:45  <phire> there is essentially an exponential groth rate in the starting phase
2011-03-30T09:10:51  <Stocha> yeah
2011-03-30T09:11:01  <Stocha> until you clash on the opponent
2011-03-30T09:11:09  <phire> yeah
2011-03-30T09:11:20  <Stocha> so you have to get food really fast and efficient up to that point. and then the game start.
2011-03-30T09:11:32  <Stocha> and exploration is good for that
2011-03-30T09:11:36  <phire> yes
2011-03-30T09:11:43  <Stocha> and knowning where food will pop is big :p
2011-03-30T09:12:02  <phire> yes
2011-03-30T09:12:19  <Stocha> still, it's not much of a real issue in most cases i could think of. Because it's simply too hard to do.
2011-03-30T09:12:55  <Stocha> with a lot of easy thing to do for your bot, without treachery.
2011-03-30T09:13:10  <phire> also, the fix is extreamly easy
2011-03-30T09:13:30  <Stocha> true. if things go really wrong, they'll switch to secure random.
2011-03-30T09:13:49  <Stocha> which won't happen by all mean really.
2011-03-30T09:14:31  <Stocha> so let's close the matter for now, and see when they settle the map generation/food spawning stuff :p
2011-03-30T09:14:40  <phire> sure
2011-03-30T09:16:44  <phire> hmm, on a slightly related note, if they go with the food around bot starting location algorithm
2011-03-30T09:16:54  <phire> defending your starting location is going to be important

2011-03-30T09:24:32  <Stocha> but discussing it is more fun :p
2011-03-30T09:24:38  <Stocha> easier sometimes also.
2011-03-30T09:24:59  <Stocha> what langage are u using ?
2011-03-30T09:26:47  <phire> I decided on c

2011-03-30T09:27:49  <phire> and I've decided python will be a bit slow

2011-03-30T09:28:13  <Stocha> but you have few means of visualisation :p
2011-03-30T09:28:23  <Stocha> unless you know a framework well

2011-03-30T12:49:18  <McLeopold> for the replay format?

2011-03-30T12:53:00  <McLeopold> Frontier: I really don't like the json
2011-03-30T12:53:54  <McLeopold> we need to go all json or all space/newline delimited, but this mix of both is just ugle
2011-03-30T12:54:18  <McLeopold> so ugly I had to use the term "ugle", which means really ugly
2011-03-30T12:58:28  <McLeopold> if we want to do json, the rip out the meta data from the replaydata string and put it into proper json
2011-03-30T12:59:09  <McLeopold> in fact, don't even have a replaydata, just turn the whole thing into json

2011-03-30T13:07:51  <Frontier> that doesn't answer my question, but we would bloat the file with json structures and I wanted to be prepared for the next contest when someone thinks of a replay format that again isn't json. I do want the separation between meta data (which is future proof json) and the replay data which can be any format.
2011-03-30T13:08:21  <Frontier> Is your primary point to have meta data and replay data on the same 'level'?
2011-03-30T13:09:28  <Frontier> Or don't you like the fact there are two ways to encode the data, but are ok with nesting the replay data into the metadata
2011-03-30T13:14:28  <Frontier> McLeopold: If we can agree on a JSON replay nested in JSON metadata and you change the specs I'll reimplement the replay format.
2011-03-30T13:17:15  <phire> how much overhead will JSON add to the replay format?
2011-03-30T13:17:27  <phire> and is it an issue?
2011-03-30T13:19:09  <Frontier> phire: it was with the streaming format, which is already large and instead of "a 12 30" it would be "{ type: "ant", row: 12, col: 30 }"
2011-03-30T13:20:26  <phire> so 6 times larger
2011-03-30T13:21:12  <Frontier> so ~10 mb per file, but now we are talking about the storage format which is pretty much compressed
2011-03-30T13:22:05  <Frontier> every ant has a single line that contains it's complete life time data.
2011-03-30T13:22:49  <phire> Why can't we compress the streaming format in the same way?
2011-03-30T13:22:57  <phire> well, almost the same way
2011-03-30T13:23:26  <Frontier> eh.. that IS the difference between the storage and streaming format
2011-03-30T13:23:54  <phire> just have a string, where each char represents the direction an ant took at that frame
2011-03-30T13:24:38  <phire> or the fact that it has died and won't be appearing in any more frames
2011-03-30T13:27:11  <Frontier> ok phire, you could do that, but currently it is more verbose and we talk about the storage format here which is 10 times smaller atm.
2011-03-30T13:27:11  <Frontier> a line looks like "a 1 1 0 0 5 0 nsew-neeeessssnwsnwensweennw-sn"
2011-03-30T13:27:11  <Frontier> in json: { row: 1, col: 1, startturn: 0, conversion: 0, endturn: 5, player: 0, moves: "nsew-neeeessssnwsnwensweennw-sn" }

2011-03-30T13:32:19  <phire> but you could have a single format for both, that looked something like this:
2011-03-30T13:32:46  <phire> { new-food: [2, 3], new-ant: [4, 5], movement: "nse--nn-wsw-esnddn-s"}
2011-03-30T13:32:53  <phire> where new food is a list of all new foods that have popped up this turn
2011-03-30T13:33:18  <phire> and new-ant is where a new ant has appeared, (replacing the food)
2011-03-30T13:33:44  <phire> and movement is the directional movements for all the ants in that turn
2011-03-30T13:34:03  <phire> its almost as compact, and still streaming
2011-03-30T13:38:20  <Frontier> I don't use the streaming format, but you can propose that to McLeopold and sigh
2011-03-30T13:43:12  <phire> it just seams a bit of a waste to have 2 formats

2011-03-30T14:11:09  <McLeopold> Frontier: I don't like the fact that you need two generic parsers to get the actual data.  Also, I'd like maps and replays to be stored as resources on the net that would be usable by any tool.  Having 1 parsing routine make it easier to pass around.
2011-03-30T14:11:49  <McLeopold> Frontier: also, as far as specific metadata goes, you are in charge and know what you need, so sigh should conform the engine to your needs.
2011-03-30T14:12:41  <McLeopold> Most of that meta data will be generated by the manager/php pages after a result has been reported by the worker.
2011-03-30T14:13:55  <McLeopold> Frontier: also, it would be possible to make the map not part of the replay, but just give another url to the visualizer to load it.
2011-03-30T14:14:16  <McLeopold> And, I always wanted a way to browse maps by sight with planet wars.

2011-03-30T16:45:40  <Naktibalda> what could be a reason
2011-03-30T16:47:46  <McLeopold> it should be calling the python bots
2011-03-30T16:49:36  <McLeopold> try running just this "python dist/sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py", then type "rows 10\ncols 10\nready\n" and see what happens
2011-03-30T16:50:04  <McLeopold> it should work with python2.7
2011-03-30T16:50:27  <Naktibalda> rows 10\ncols 10\nready\n
2011-03-30T16:50:38  <Naktibalda> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10\\ncols'

2011-03-30T16:52:29  <McLeopold> so the bots should work with 2.6 or 2.7
2011-03-30T16:53:04  <McLeopold> doesn't work with python 3.1
2011-03-30T16:53:31  <Naktibalda> yes, bot works

2011-03-30T16:54:25  <McLeopold> that doesn't sound right

2011-03-30T18:42:37  <Naktibalda> playgame.py worked 3 or 4 weeks ago
2011-03-30T18:43:04  <sigh> are you familiar with git bisect?
2011-03-30T18:43:13  <Naktibalda> no
2011-03-30T18:44:16  <Naktibalda> 40940 function calls (40756 primitive calls) in 0.190 CPU seconds
2011-03-30T18:44:44  <sigh> I don't really have the time to help you right now, but git bisect can help you find the last good revision
2011-03-30T18:45:02  <sigh> other than that the only thing I can think of is to give you a version with a lot more logging
2011-03-30T18:46:02  <McLeopold> Naktibalda: I can look at the issue later, in about 5 hours, if you don't solve it
2011-03-30T18:47:34  <Naktibalda> should I report an issue?
2011-03-30T18:47:53  <sigh> Naktibalda: sure
2011-03-30T18:48:44  <sigh> McLeopold: I was reading through the logs, "$@" inserts the command line arguments given to the script... so you can do things like ./play_one_game.sh --log_output
2011-03-30T18:48:53  <sigh> it would not be causing problems

2011-03-30T19:21:32  <McLeopold> sigh: play_one_game is meant to be an example of how to run playgame.py, let's not make it take any command line arguments
2011-03-30T19:22:00  * Naktibalda is going to wait a few more weeks

2011-03-30T19:22:29  <McLeopold> lets make a readme that encourages people to customize it for testing
2011-03-30T19:23:26  <sigh> ok
2011-03-30T19:23:43  <janzert> maybe belongs in a readme type text file instead of an actual script then?
2011-03-30T19:23:56  <sigh> yeah, that seems to be better
2011-03-30T19:23:57  <janzert> if it's meant to be an example of a command line that is
2011-03-30T19:24:13  * Naktibalda failed to find a working version :)
2011-03-30T19:24:33  <sigh> Naktibalda: even from 3 or 4 weeks ago?
2011-03-30T19:25:39  <Naktibalda> I can't find a working map

2011-03-30T19:27:34  <sigh> ah, you must have hit the repo in a broken state :(
2011-03-30T19:35:21  <Naktibalda> at last found a working version :)
2011-03-30T19:37:18  <Naktibalda> There are only 'skip'ped commits left to test.

2011-03-30T19:42:49  <McLeopold> janzert: I was thinking a step in the starter guide would be "run play_one_game and watch a game play locally"

2011-03-30T19:43:36  <McLeopold> janzert/sigh: also, test_bot.cmd is meant to run the exact same test that the worker will run for compilation tests
2011-03-30T19:44:15  <McLeopold> Naktibalda: you may be in the realm of the row/col reversed code

2011-03-30T19:46:22  <Naktibalda> must be one of these: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/2c5dcabb3dacaac2b9e6a68028be2b9655bf1acf https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/0796834efb1443a6dc934860d007964e6f8d4cc3
2011-03-30T19:48:27  <janzert> McLeopold: but telling the to run play_one_game and watch doesn't teach anything that can then be applied later, instead telling them to run whatever the command is in play_one_game will let them see what is actually happening and allow them to modify it for their own use
