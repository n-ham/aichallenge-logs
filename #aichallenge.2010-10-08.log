2010-10-08T02:03:41  <Janzert> Zannick: I wonder after your compile_anything cleanup is merged if the language information could be separated out into its own module and the language specific command and main code file added to it and moved out of the database. That way all language information would be in one spot the database would just be used to enable which languages were active.

2010-10-08T07:10:58  <sigh> dmj111: 1 loss isn't that bad... it's still working its way up
2010-10-08T07:12:52  <sigh> hmmm... actually you completely failed at neutral stealing in that one...
2010-10-08T07:13:06  <sigh> my current bot on the site has the same problem :D
2010-10-08T07:15:38  <dmj111> yeah, I never noticed that bug.  I launch from one planet with 15 to steal the neutral, than with 45 from a closer planet to stage my ships.
2010-10-08T07:16:00  <dmj111> 45 takes the neutral, then boom.  There may be more reasons for that loss, but that one is bad.
2010-10-08T07:17:03  <dmj111> as janzert said though... this is certainly reason not to get seeded by previous results.   But.... my previous bot would have done that too, so it is also a good reason to not only play people within +/- rankings.
2010-10-08T07:17:12  <dmj111> +/- 10 rankings i mean.
2010-10-08T07:17:59  <sigh> dmj111: yup, I agree
2010-10-08T07:18:21  <sigh> also you never notice in testing, because your other bots aren't that silly :P
2010-10-08T07:18:55  <sigh> that's also why I didn't bother to upload a fixed version, when it gets up to the higher ranks that bug won't matter anymore
2010-10-08T07:19:57  <delt0r_> sigh: famous last words.... "that bug won't matter......."
2010-10-08T07:20:21  <dmj111> the weird thing is my newer version doesn't do that, but I don't know why....
2010-10-08T07:20:32  <sigh> haha... delt0r_, I have fixed it locally :P
2010-10-08T07:21:21  <sigh> dmj111: well, you've got a concrete position to test it on... shouldn't be hard to find out why

2010-10-08T12:44:00  <bhasker> how is it that on the official server the report says opponent timed out,but I lost the game???
2010-10-08T12:44:06  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5611511
2010-10-08T12:44:15  <McLeopold> both time out?
2010-10-08T12:44:36  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5609368
2010-10-08T12:45:01  <bhasker> i don't think i time out, been playing on tcp server and with much larger number of fleets in play my bot doesn't take over 200ms per turn
2010-10-08T12:45:08  <bhasker> these games are terminating with hardly any fleets in play
2010-10-08T12:45:19  <bhasker> if both time out shouldn't it be a draw?
2010-10-08T12:45:20  <McLeopold> It looks like they got their logic backwards.
2010-10-08T12:45:42  <McLeopold> That means you could write SurrenderBot and win the contest!
2010-10-08T12:46:07  <bhasker> or at least grant it to the person who times out last
2010-10-08T12:46:14  <bhasker> well actually nm
2010-10-08T12:46:18  <bhasker> they should add a ping check
2010-10-08T12:46:28  <bhasker> if a bot is alive it should respond to the ping
2010-10-08T12:46:37  <bhasker> if its going in a loop
2010-10-08T12:47:01  <McLeopold> both bots need to send a go to stdout in time
2010-10-08T12:47:05  <McLeopold> that should be good enough
2010-10-08T12:47:33  <McLeopold> You'd better open an issue.  There may be one already.
2010-10-08T12:47:46  <McLeopold> btw, ScotBot6 is on tcp
2010-10-08T12:48:27  <bhasker> my current bot is doing terribly
2010-10-08T12:48:28  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-08T12:48:35  <bhasker> i added some crap
2010-10-08T12:48:38  <bhasker> and now its doing worse than before
2010-10-08T12:48:43  <McLeopold> didn't you beat ScotBot5?
2010-10-08T12:48:45  <bhasker> yes
2010-10-08T12:48:54  <McLeopold> That was my official version.
2010-10-08T12:49:00  <bhasker> on the official server that same one is crashing out
2010-10-08T12:49:03  <bhasker> on every other game
2010-10-08T12:49:07  <bhasker> so my rank is like 800
2010-10-08T12:49:08  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-08T12:49:14  <bhasker> :(
2010-10-08T12:49:53  <McLeopold> Do you know how to get the results so you can replay it through your bot?

2010-10-08T12:56:00  <Lithosphere> can you replay an official game by id using a command line tool?
2010-10-08T12:56:07  <bhasker> yes

2010-10-08T12:56:36  <a1k0n> it's possible the load on one of the servers is like 20 again, as it's happened before with some java bots that failed to get killed

2010-10-08T13:31:26  <Zannick> the problem with the c# compiler might stand in the way

2010-10-08T13:34:34  <JamesMG> I suppose so, I don't know much about it, I'm using this contest to learn C#
2010-10-08T13:34:42  <JamesMG> almost regret that
2010-10-08T13:35:02  <Frontier> Talking about turtles, my bot is called turtle on the TCP server ^^
2010-10-08T13:35:17  <Accoun> he use linux, M.B. it only have slow version of C#
2010-10-08T13:35:34  <Accoun> java the best in this cause
2010-10-08T13:37:33  <Frontier> Java takes rather long to load and doesn't execute as fast as C++, but I really like the language as such.
2010-10-08T13:37:57  <BtbN> Java needs some of the newer C# features.

2010-10-08T13:38:17  <Frontier> What would that be?
2010-10-08T13:38:51  <BtbN> Lambdas and Closures for example
2010-10-08T13:39:24  <Frontier> Never heard of that. Do I need lambdas and closures?
2010-10-08T13:39:53  <BtbN> if you learned how they work, you don't want to write code without using them
2010-10-08T13:40:16  <BtbN> Linq is also a great C# feature/library
2010-10-08T13:40:17  <Zannick> they're pretty neat
2010-10-08T13:40:25  <Zannick> i love using them in python
2010-10-08T13:40:56  <BtbN> writing sql-like querys on collections is just great
2010-10-08T13:41:00  <Frontier> I have no idea what you talk about. I better stick with Delphi, C++ and Java :)
2010-10-08T13:41:26  <Zannick> they're a little more unwieldy in imperative languages than functional or scripting languages
2010-10-08T13:42:04  <BtbN> so 3 languages which don't implement any of the modern features... nice
2010-10-08T13:42:30  <Frontier> I'm a conservative -.-
2010-10-08T13:42:34  <Zannick> i'd like to see more support for esoteric languages, actually
2010-10-08T13:42:58  <BtbN> A brainfuck-AI in top10 would be awesome :D
2010-10-08T13:43:31  <Frontier> Their execution speed could become a problem. Or do native compilers exist?
2010-10-08T13:43:34  <Zannick> brainfuck, whitespace, malbolge
2010-10-08T13:43:36  <Zannick> i would be impressed with a malbolge entry
2010-10-08T13:43:51  <BtbN> well, noone will use malbolge
2010-10-08T13:44:00  <Zannick> that's why i'd be impressed
2010-10-08T13:44:02  <Zannick> :P
2010-10-08T13:44:18  <optimum> is anyone using genetic algorithms?
2010-10-08T13:44:53  <Frontier> No, but I feel like this is another opportunity to ask: Will I need them?
2010-10-08T13:45:18  <Zannick> "need" is a tricky question in a competition like this
2010-10-08T13:45:19  <BtbN> An asm-programmer could also ask this question to a C programmer...
2010-10-08T13:45:24  <Frontier> Genetic Algorithms sounds obscure. Do they mutate?
2010-10-08T13:46:18  <optimum> Frontier: it's a form of stochastic beam search

2010-10-08T13:48:44  <Frontier> beam search? i have absolutely no beams in my code. it works more like a thread from to to bottom. I could imagine that I will write a script that tunes my bots variables over time though.
2010-10-08T13:49:14  <optimum> myself i like simulated annealing (another form of stochastic beam search), but i don't see offhand how to apply it

2010-10-08T13:59:20  <Frontier> Yet 70% or so of my bot will always be the algorithm and not the tuning of its variables. And you can't apply anything there than your imagination, trial, error and math.

2010-10-08T15:30:01  <decipher> hey could anyone help me out with my ai bot, come to the end of debugging and it still randomly crashes
2010-10-08T15:31:07  <Meatkat> cfaftw: hey sorry was afk
2010-10-08T15:31:51  <Meatkat> cfaftw: yeah that game was a heartbreaker, I lost by like 3 troops
2010-10-08T15:32:04  <cfaftw> ridiculous :P
2010-10-08T15:32:17  <decipher> hey have any of you programmed a bot for the contest
2010-10-08T15:32:18  <decipher> ?
2010-10-08T15:32:27  <cfaftw> most of us have
2010-10-08T15:33:01  <JamesMG> Is there a verdict on what is causing the turn 1 losses without an invalid order/timeout message?
2010-10-08T15:33:01  <decipher> my bot seems to be logically correct but it still crashes is sthere some rules i should know about like max planets you can own max fleets or some kinda over flop that would crash the game mid way
2010-10-08T15:33:02  <JamesMG> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5618882
2010-10-08T15:33:08  <decipher> or am i just making a bad move
2010-10-08T15:33:11  <Meatkat> cfaftw: on the plus side I'm ranked in the top100 now! or at least I was a couple seconds ago
2010-10-08T15:33:24  <cfaftw> meatkat, i saw that... congrats!
2010-10-08T15:33:32  <Naktibalda> decipher: do you get Invalid order errors in TCP server?
2010-10-08T15:33:36  <decipher> my bot makes 20 sometimes 40 50 moves then the board dissapears
2010-10-08T15:33:47  <decipher> just says player 2 time out
2010-10-08T15:33:59  <cfaftw> decipher, do you ever say "go"?
2010-10-08T15:34:04  <decipher> what go?
2010-10-08T15:34:06  <decipher> lol
2010-10-08T15:34:23  <Naktibalda> should be an invalid order
2010-10-08T15:34:38  <decipher> i say finish turn at the end of my doturn method just incase it doeing to many moves
2010-10-08T15:34:39  <Meatkat> JamesMG: yeah it's frustrating, I haven't heard anything yet
2010-10-08T15:34:42  <Naktibalda> log all orders and check what you did wrong at the last turn
2010-10-08T15:34:51  <Zannick> JamesMG: perhaps the server doesn't have the error reporting code on it :/
2010-10-08T15:34:54  <Meatkat> cfaftw: thanks!
2010-10-08T15:35:06  <decipher> does a bad move crash teh game?
2010-10-08T15:35:14  <decipher> like senidng more ships then a player owns?
2010-10-08T15:35:14  <cfaftw> decipher, in my bot, i modified the "issue_order" method to perform a legality check
2010-10-08T15:35:20  <decipher> kk
2010-10-08T15:35:20  <Naktibalda> decipher: yes
2010-10-08T15:35:34  <decipher> so your saying that
2010-10-08T15:35:35  <cfaftw> decipher, a bad move is considered a forfeit (loss) for your bot
2010-10-08T15:35:39  <decipher> ok
2010-10-08T15:35:46  <cfaftw> the game will end immediately
2010-10-08T15:35:52  <cfaftw> it's not a crash
2010-10-08T15:35:57  *** jesionaj <jesionaj!~dongs@cpe-65-28-239-50.woh.res.rr.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-08T15:36:00  <decipher> so lets say i do a game tree.. and by teh time my game tree ends mys tate changes and becasue the bot attacked me i didnt send teh wriet amount of ships
2010-10-08T15:36:04  <decipher> ok
2010-10-08T15:36:06  <decipher> sorry not a crash
2010-10-08T15:36:22  <decipher> sorry for the awful typing
2010-10-08T15:36:37  <decipher> so yeah my bot looses because i send to many ships because the game state changes?
2010-10-08T15:36:39  <cfaftw> you make up for it by your use of "teh"
2010-10-08T15:36:46  <decipher> lol
2010-10-08T15:36:46  <JamesMG> decipher: the game state shouldn't be changing in your code unless you changed it on your side
2010-10-08T15:36:52  <JamesMG> mid turn that is
2010-10-08T15:36:53  <decipher> yeah
2010-10-08T15:37:17  <decipher> i mean like the game state i receive and the actual game state playing, i make a move but stuff has changed
2010-10-08T15:37:43  <decipher> like why would i make a wrong move i ensure my bot knows how many ships i have?
2010-10-08T15:37:45  <cfaftw> stuff doesn't change until the next turn
2010-10-08T15:37:49  <decipher> kk
2010-10-08T15:37:53  <decipher> so why does it fail
2010-10-08T15:37:55  <Naktibalda> decipher: bug in your code :)
2010-10-08T15:37:58  <decipher> lol
2010-10-08T15:38:04  <decipher> so your saying i should
2010-10-08T15:38:06  <cfaftw> you might be altering the current turn's ACTUAL game state
2010-10-08T15:38:09  <decipher> just have a legality check
2010-10-08T15:38:09  <Naktibalda> it's allways a reason
2010-10-08T15:38:15  <decipher> to ensure my  bug doesnt complicate stuff
2010-10-08T15:38:22  <cfaftw> so your bot thinks a planet has X ships, when really it has Y ships
2010-10-08T15:38:33  <decipher> why would that happen
2010-10-08T15:38:41  <cfaftw> that's for you to find out
2010-10-08T15:38:52  <JamesMG> pass by reference vs by value errors maybe?  What language?
2010-10-08T15:39:01  <decipher> java
2010-10-08T15:39:15  <Naktibalda> for example it happens, if you send 2 fleets from the same planet but don't update a number of ships on planet
2010-10-08T15:39:50  <decipher> but each turn a pw is passed in and i parse it to a string array to give me a map state
2010-10-08T15:40:13  <Naktibalda> you won't solve this issue by guessing, log orders and compare last orders with number of ships in planets
2010-10-08T15:40:15  <cfaftw> -_-
2010-10-08T15:40:19  <Naktibalda> test it in TCP server
2010-10-08T15:40:31  <decipher> testing is a pain in teh ass lol
2010-10-08T15:40:35  <decipher> i dont know what turn it ends on
2010-10-08T15:40:39  <decipher> so i have to guess and hope
2010-10-08T15:40:44  <Naktibalda> log all turns
2010-10-08T15:40:47  <decipher> that i catch the right state
2010-10-08T15:40:48  <decipher> yeah
2010-10-08T15:40:51  <cfaftw> yeah you can keep track of turns
2010-10-08T15:41:01  <cfaftw> turn += 1
2010-10-08T15:41:03  <decipher> i guess i need to add a counter to my file so it adds more files each time it gest that
2010-10-08T15:41:07  <decipher> there*
2010-10-08T15:41:16  *** _Utkarsh <_Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.80.79> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2010-10-08T15:41:17  <decipher> i have a turn global counter
2010-10-08T15:42:23  <decipher> any chance i can have ur new issue order method?
2010-10-08T15:42:31  <decipher> actually nvm all i do is check ships right?
2010-10-08T15:43:29  <cfaftw> yep
2010-10-08T15:43:33  <decipher> umm
2010-10-08T15:43:37  <decipher> so if your move is quicker then a second
2010-10-08T15:43:52  <decipher> the game waits till the second to make both ur opponent and ur move so ur together?
2010-10-08T15:44:02  <cfaftw> yes
2010-10-08T15:44:04  <decipher> kk
2010-10-08T15:44:15  <cfaftw> if you go over a second, your bot forfeits and the game ends immediately
2010-10-08T15:44:22  <Naktibalda> no 1 second is max
2010-10-08T15:44:31  <jmcarthur> man, even after you have picked targets, deciding how to create optimal orders for those targets can be tough.
2010-10-08T15:44:42  <cfaftw> under one second, the game doesn't progress until both players have said "go"
2010-10-08T15:44:43  <decipher> i store my score as i go
2010-10-08T15:44:48  <Naktibalda> if both bots makes orders faster, engine starts another turn imediatelly
2010-10-08T15:44:54  <decipher> when do you say go?
2010-10-08T15:45:03  <cfaftw> jmcarthur, yep.
2010-10-08T15:45:04  <decipher> i didnt see that under pw
2010-10-08T15:45:05  <jmcarthur> decipher: if you and your opponent both say "go" before the 1 second is up, the engine goes ahead and advances to the next turn
2010-10-08T15:45:12  <decipher> oh ok
2010-10-08T15:45:16  <decipher> not necessary

2010-10-08T15:47:55  <decipher> has anybody tried training a neural net for this
2010-10-08T15:48:01  <decipher> can you read in values froma  file
2010-10-08T15:48:33  <jmcarthur> decipher: i think you can
2010-10-08T15:48:37  <cfaftw> you could train using the games on the official website
2010-10-08T15:49:25  <decipher> you could create a supervised multi layer neural net that uses backpropagation to train but i dont have that kinda time ^^ lol
2010-10-08T15:50:04  <cfaftw> and i don't have that kinda skill
2010-10-08T15:50:12  <decipher> it take no time to make a move it already be trained but if a new map was presented i dont know hwo it handle that
2010-10-08T15:50:27  <decipher> i guess thats where the 95 percent memorization comes from
2010-10-08T15:53:31  <agares> wenas
2010-10-08T15:53:35  <decipher> one last question, where it issue the order in planetwars class it just system.out.prints then system.flush is that how it executes so if i just put that in a loop with if it will check it

2010-10-08T15:59:05  <jmcarthur> crashes or times out?
2010-10-08T15:59:08  <Naktibalda> did you implement logging?
2010-10-08T15:59:11  <decipher> maybe
2010-10-08T15:59:15  <Naktibalda> invalid order :)
2010-10-08T15:59:17  <cfaftw> LOL
2010-10-08T15:59:20  <jmcarthur> if it's timing out then you might not be sending "go" like you should
2010-10-08T15:59:28  <cfaftw> "did you implement logging?"  ... "maybe."
2010-10-08T15:59:35  <decipher> im saying pw.finishTurn() at teh end of method

2010-10-08T16:00:14  <decipher> its impossible to be sending invalid move with that condition
2010-10-08T16:00:19  <decipher> so it must be timing out
2010-10-08T16:00:25  <decipher> grr
2010-10-08T16:00:26  <Naktibalda> it's still possible
2010-10-08T16:00:45  <cfaftw> decipher, just time how long your turns take
2010-10-08T16:00:45  <decipher> how? sending planets to ur self?
2010-10-08T16:00:50  <decipher> i do usually
2010-10-08T16:00:54  <Naktibalda> standard issueOrder() method doesn't update numships
2010-10-08T16:00:55  <cfaftw> print out the elapsed time at the end of the turn
2010-10-08T16:00:59  <jmcarthur> decipher: are you perhaps sending more than one fleet from the source planet? maybe the sum of those fleets is greater than the current ships at the planet?
2010-10-08T16:01:06  <decipher> but i dont know what turn it ends on i need to log every turn and every tree branch state per turn
2010-10-08T16:01:12  <jmcarthur> decipher: if src == dst then it crashes too
2010-10-08T16:01:17  <cfaftw> also... if you are printing this stuff to stdout, it's going think it's an invalid move
2010-10-08T16:01:21  <Naktibalda> decipher: yes, do that
2010-10-08T16:01:25  <cfaftw> you need to debug to a file or something
2010-10-08T16:01:34  <decipher> yeah
2010-10-08T16:02:14  <decipher> i gotta head to work but tonight ill make a pure debug method this shouldnt be crashes this hard but maybe i'm checking to see if my fleet is less then my num of ships but im sending multiple fleets causing it still to crash?

2010-10-08T16:26:00  <nrub_> just speculating
2010-10-08T16:26:20  <Zannick> agweber: you might be sending too many ships
2010-10-08T16:26:40  <agweber> Might I? Hmm..
2010-10-08T16:27:10  <nrub_> yeah its pretty hard to figure out what's wrong with your bot in the current viewer so I made my own
2010-10-08T16:27:35  <Zannick> if some neutrals have the same number of ships, you increment count multiple times and go over 100 but don't do anything about that
2010-10-08T16:28:03  <agweber> Ah... quite possibly
2010-10-08T16:28:13  <Zannick> (you also might increment count multiple times per planet, but that's probably unrelated)

2010-10-08T16:30:08  <agweber> Yeahh.. I need some equals instead of >'s and <'s

2010-10-08T17:47:53  <rabidus> i didn't know that there are so much combinations on diffrent planets
2010-10-08T17:48:53  <rabidus> my 2 GHz computer calculates 16 planet combinations 0.7 seconds
2010-10-08T17:49:17  <rabidus> only lists them, without outputting them
2010-10-08T17:49:33  <Zannick> with what language?
2010-10-08T17:49:37  <rabidus> c++
2010-10-08T17:50:31  <rabidus> and, intresting part is that php can do that same.
2010-10-08T17:50:40  <rabidus> only 20% slower
2010-10-08T17:50:49  <Zannick> 16 combinations? what exactly do you mean?
2010-10-08T17:50:58  <Zannick> all subsets of the 16 planets?
2010-10-08T17:51:28  <rabidus> umm.. like with three planets you can have 6 combinations. 1,2,3,(1,2),(2,3),(1,2,3)
2010-10-08T17:51:39  <rabidus> four planets is twice as big as that
2010-10-08T17:51:44  <Zannick> okay, yeah, all subsets
2010-10-08T17:51:45  <rabidus> and so on.
2010-10-08T17:51:48  <rabidus> yeah
2010-10-08T17:52:08  <Zannick> yeah, that's 2^16
2010-10-08T17:52:12  <rabidus> +1
2010-10-08T17:52:21  <Zannick> also there are 8 combinations for 3 planets
2010-10-08T17:52:27  <rabidus> (2^n)+1
2010-10-08T17:52:27  <Zannick> none and (1,3)
2010-10-08T17:52:39  <Zannick> uh...
2010-10-08T17:52:52  <rabidus> it depends what are you calculating
2010-10-08T17:53:12  <Zannick> well, a set of size S has 2^S subsets.
2010-10-08T17:53:18  <rabidus> yeah
2010-10-08T17:53:21  <Zannick> but yes, it depends exactly what you're looking for
2010-10-08T17:53:58  <rabidus> yep. i'm trying to just check on my first turn that which planet set is best choise
2010-10-08T17:54:06  <rabidus> for ... productivity..
2010-10-08T17:54:13  <rabidus> i don't know the word
2010-10-08T17:55:21  <rabidus> ie. 'how many ships you can gain in x turns from these y sets of planets'
2010-10-08T17:55:34  * Zannick nod
2010-10-08T17:55:42  <rabidus> nod?
2010-10-08T17:55:56  <Zannick> i understand what you mean
2010-10-08T17:56:01  <rabidus> k.
2010-10-08T17:56:31  <rabidus> i didn't know that that algorithm is that slow
2010-10-08T17:56:40  <rabidus> and that kinda sucks :D
2010-10-08T17:57:01  <rabidus> or i'm just fukken bad coder, which is so true
2010-10-08T17:57:03  <Zannick> you could get some good speedup by cutting out planets
2010-10-08T17:57:14  <rabidus> yep, that's true
2010-10-08T17:57:14  <rabidus> byt
2010-10-08T17:57:16  <rabidus> ut
2010-10-08T17:57:19  <rabidus> *but
2010-10-08T17:57:31  <Zannick> if this is your first turn, you should rule out planets closer to your opponent
2010-10-08T17:57:40  <Zannick> that's half

2010-10-08T17:59:10  <rabidus> 2^32 to 2^16
2010-10-08T17:59:31  <rabidus> i thinkg 32 is max

2010-10-08T17:59:37  <rabidus> i don't know tho

2010-10-08T17:59:49  <Zannick> not fixed in stone, though
2010-10-08T17:59:53  <rabidus> but that function MUST procedure atleast 16 planets

2010-10-08T19:21:00  <rabidus> but felixcoto
2010-10-08T19:21:27  <McLeopold> ?
2010-10-08T19:21:55  <jmcarthur> what did i just watch
2010-10-08T19:22:19  <McLeopold> um, a planet wars replay?
2010-10-08T19:23:20  <jmcarthur> what is crowbot's objective? i just saw a pretty well played standoff followed by an explosion of activity
2010-10-08T19:23:32  <McLeopold> steal planets
2010-10-08T19:23:54  <McLeopold> that last one was just cool, i'll find a better example
2010-10-08T19:24:03  <jmcarthur> aha!
2010-10-08T19:25:14  <jmcarthur> i wonder what McLeopold.RageBot.py would be like
2010-10-08T19:25:43  <bhasker> can someone look at http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=379983
2010-10-08T19:25:54  <bhasker> at turn 35/36 to be precise
2010-10-08T19:25:55  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=379307
2010-10-08T19:26:48  <bhasker> actually never mind
2010-10-08T19:26:51  <sigh> bhasker: defence fail?
2010-10-08T19:26:52  <bhasker> i launched the ship a turn late
2010-10-08T19:26:55  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-08T19:26:56  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-08T19:27:06  <bhasker> looks like i have a bug
2010-10-08T19:27:11  <bhasker> :-\
2010-10-08T19:27:16  <McLeopold> it looks like a planet got taken that shouldn't?
2010-10-08T19:27:31  <bhasker> yea i am not sure
2010-10-08T19:27:42  <bhasker> it looks like a 6 fleet of mine and the 14 hit the same turn
2010-10-08T19:27:52  <bhasker> or am i 1 turn behind
2010-10-08T19:27:57  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: not what i meant :P
2010-10-08T19:27:57  <McLeopold> oh, one turn late.  It's hard to tell distances with the viewer
2010-10-08T19:28:10  <bhasker> yea 1 turn late
2010-10-08T19:28:11  <bhasker> hmm
2010-10-08T19:28:19  <bhasker> miscalculation nm
2010-10-08T19:28:20  <sigh> yeah, off by one error
2010-10-08T19:28:33  <sigh> shouldn't be a hard fix :(
2010-10-08T19:28:34  <sigh> :)
2010-10-08T19:28:41  <bhasker> hopefully
2010-10-08T19:29:13  <McLeopold> okay, here it is http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=379630
2010-10-08T19:29:26  <McLeopold> CrowBot in action with what it was designed to do.
2010-10-08T19:29:56  <sigh> yup, this is high-level ragebot
2010-10-08T19:29:58  <sigh> very nice
2010-10-08T19:30:03  <McLeopold> maybe only the first 10 moves are a good example...
2010-10-08T19:30:19  <sigh> how does it select planets?
2010-10-08T19:30:56  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=379933, kinda better
2010-10-08T19:31:51  <McLeopold> I'm just not getting the close start maps.
2010-10-08T19:32:08  <McLeopold> It's suppose to wait one turn, then take everything the opponent wants.
2010-10-08T19:32:20  <McLeopold> Except it will build normal if it feels behind.
2010-10-08T19:32:31  <McLeopold> Modified WormBot.

2010-10-08T19:33:18  <sigh> cool
2010-10-08T19:34:21  <McLeopold> The weird thing is, it just sits there if it is ahead, not doing anything, and usually wins?
2010-10-08T19:34:24  <McLeopold> o_O
2010-10-08T19:35:05  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@213.88.2.78> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2010-10-08T19:36:03  <McLeopold> like this: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=380191
2010-10-08T19:36:38  <jmcarthur> i'm amazed at how many bots (even top ones!) will resort to inaction when they are not winning
2010-10-08T19:37:23  <sigh> jmcarthur: my bot doesn't know anything about who's ahead or behind :)
2010-10-08T19:37:34  <sigh> neither did dmj111's or davidjliu's last time I spoke to them
2010-10-08T19:37:46  <nrub_> mine does nothing if it's winning
2010-10-08T19:38:13  <McLeopold> Okay, here is the best example so far: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=380218
2010-10-08T19:38:23  <sigh> it's "obvious" to everyone that the tactics should be different, but not so obvious how
2010-10-08T19:38:46  <jmcarthur> sigh: i'm sure it's not an explicit concept, but surely most reasonable heuristics are affected indirectly by the situation
2010-10-08T19:39:12  <McLeopold> my official one doesn't.  I think you're going to need somthing.
2010-10-08T19:39:46  <nrub_> McLeopold: in that last replay your bot does nothing when oldman2 takes the last neutral
2010-10-08T19:39:50  <sigh> jmcarthur: sure, what I mean is that the bots don't use the ship count difference or production difference in the code at all
2010-10-08T19:39:59  <nrub_> it could have easily intercepted
2010-10-08T19:40:00  <McLeopold> I know, it just doesn't care.
2010-10-08T19:40:52  <jmcarthur> sigh: yeah, i'm sure of that
2010-10-08T19:41:17  <jmcarthur> sigh: having special code for different scenarios is more work and ad hoc
2010-10-08T19:41:22  <sigh> I tried a few meta-strategies that alter the bot's actions based on it's evaluation of the overall game, but haven't been able to get anything good
2010-10-08T19:41:43  <jmcarthur> sigh: i'm just surprised that so many heuristics aren't even showing any emergent behavior for such situations
2010-10-08T19:41:56  <sigh> jmcarthur: also, many of the top bots err on the side of defence... which means inaction when outnumbered
2010-10-08T19:42:01  <McLeopold> nrub_: It probably figured the 2 planets next to it might defend
2010-10-08T19:42:19  <sigh> dmj111 is very defensive, for example
2010-10-08T19:42:24  <jmcarthur> yeah i've noticed
2010-10-08T19:42:33  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: what types of behavior?
2010-10-08T19:43:02  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: something more aggressive when losing rather than just idling
2010-10-08T19:43:23  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=380277
2010-10-08T19:43:43  <McLeopold> another good one, and by good, I mean something I wouldn't try and program, but worked.
2010-10-08T19:43:53  <sigh> two things, 1) it is hard to figure out what to do, and 2) does it matter? are you too far behind to do anything in that situation?
2010-10-08T19:44:02  <sigh> ^^ @jmcarthur
2010-10-08T19:44:23  <jmcarthur> sigh: i often see easy expansions that are not being taken
2010-10-08T19:44:26  <McLeopold> sigh: it's not too hard.  if you're behind, take a planet
2010-10-08T19:45:09  <jmcarthur> and i'm talking about with >100 turns left, plenty of time to make up for the losses of taking it
2010-10-08T19:45:18  <sigh> figuring out if your behind is tricky in itself... if it is very obvious you are probabaly too far behind
2010-10-08T19:45:42  <McLeopold> CrowBot changes everything in my mind.
2010-10-08T19:45:45  <sigh> well, at least for me, I haven't had much success :)
2010-10-08T19:45:55  <sigh> McLeopold: what does it change?
2010-10-08T19:45:57  <McLeopold> I never thought it would work.
2010-10-08T19:46:06  <sigh> you think bots should be more reactive?
2010-10-08T19:46:06  <McLeopold> I thought it would be like MoldBot.
2010-10-08T19:46:22  <sigh> what did moldbot do?
2010-10-08T19:46:22  <McLeopold> It's not securing a border...
2010-10-08T19:46:29  <McLeopold> It's not trying to grow faster...
2010-10-08T19:46:43  <McLeopold> It's not forwarding to "correct" spots...
2010-10-08T19:47:00  <McLeopold> Sometimes it doesn't forward...
2010-10-08T19:47:29  <McLeopold> It feels like tit-for-tat
2010-10-08T19:47:47  <jmcarthur> interesting
2010-10-08T19:47:48  <sigh> yeah, it's like copybot but smarter
2010-10-08T19:48:07  <McLeopold> It's not trying to finish off the opponent...
2010-10-08T19:48:10  <jmcarthur> honestly, we never did figure out what makes ragebot so tough when you're starting out
2010-10-08T19:48:25  <sigh> jmcarthur: easy, starter paks do no defence
2010-10-08T19:48:26  <McLeopold> big fleets?
2010-10-08T19:48:31  <sigh> *packs
2010-10-08T19:48:54  <sigh> once you implement any sort of defence, ragebot is thwarted

2010-10-08T19:49:12  <sigh> then it only does well on close maps, in which case you tighten up your defence code
2010-10-08T19:49:55  <McLeopold> Okay, I'm going to try CrowBot2
2010-10-08T19:50:22  <sigh> McLeopold: look forward to it :)
2010-10-08T19:50:22  <jmcarthur> dun dun dunnnn
2010-10-08T19:50:32  <sigh> jmcarthur: does my reasoning make sense?
2010-10-08T19:50:40  <jmcarthur> sigh: yeah makes sense
2010-10-08T19:51:02  <jmcarthur> sigh: but why ragebot specifically? is it just because it's so aggressive?
2010-10-08T19:51:04  <tty1> hey guys, i have a short break between projects, anyone need any AI help or feedback?
2010-10-08T19:51:09  <jmcarthur> compared to the other starters
2010-10-08T19:51:23  <McLeopold> it always attacks the opponent, not neutrals?
2010-10-08T19:51:32  <sigh> yeah, the other starters attack neutrals as well
2010-10-08T19:51:57  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=380388
2010-10-08T19:52:47  * Naktibalda needs a stronger opponent bot for local testing
2010-10-08T19:52:54  <sigh> bhasker: woah, explosion
2010-10-08T19:53:01  <bhasker> yea his bot went nuts
2010-10-08T19:53:03  <bhasker> suddenly
2010-10-08T19:53:05  <sigh> red was silly :P
2010-10-08T19:53:12  <McLeopold> So, what you guys think about me releasing WormBot and CrowBot?
2010-10-08T19:53:28  <bhasker> i think people in the forums hated when someone released a top 50 c# bot
2010-10-08T19:53:36  <bhasker> since that makes it harder for newcomers
2010-10-08T19:53:37  <McLeopold> There was already some backlash for someone else.
2010-10-08T19:53:41  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-08T19:53:45  <sigh> bhasker: it mist have decided that taking lots of little planets was good because higher overall growth
2010-10-08T19:53:51  <sigh> McLeopold: personally, I'm all for it
2010-10-08T19:53:51  <bhasker> yea
2010-10-08T19:54:12  <jmcarthur> man, i remember when Max was in first
2010-10-08T19:54:17  <jmcarthur> he's in 484 now
2010-10-08T19:54:25  <McLeopold> Those bots couldn't win.  But they help look for weaknesses against bot types.
2010-10-08T19:54:53  <McLeopold> was that before or after a1k0n?
2010-10-08T19:54:58  <jmcarthur> before
2010-10-08T19:55:03  <sigh> personally, I'm for anything that will raise the level of the competition
2010-10-08T19:55:12  <sigh> but others don't agree, it seems :(
2010-10-08T19:55:17  <jmcarthur> i don't think releasing the code for a top 50 bot increases competition
2010-10-08T19:55:18  <McLeopold> There was some good arguments against.
2010-10-08T19:55:38  <jmcarthur> all that does is raise the bar above where some people can continue to compete
2010-10-08T19:55:44  <McLeopold> You don't want everyone just submitting your code.
2010-10-08T19:55:56  <bhasker> lamo
2010-10-08T19:55:58  <bhasker> need to fix this

2010-10-08T19:56:25  <bhasker> what mcleopold said
2010-10-08T19:56:27  <McLeopold> yeah, if there are some groups that can't program a top 50 bot, they may still want to compete with each other
2010-10-08T19:56:30  <bhasker> discuss the strategy
2010-10-08T19:56:36  <bhasker> but don't release a fully functional bot
2010-10-08T19:56:36  <jmcarthur> it's like having a pole vaulting contest with 3000 people but assuming that everybody can manage at least 15 feet
2010-10-08T19:56:41  <bhasker> let someone work at the code at least
2010-10-08T19:56:46  <McLeopold> If they just copy a bot they can't understand, what's the point?

2010-10-08T19:57:15  <bhasker> knowing a strategy and implementing it correctly are two different things
2010-10-08T19:57:22  <bhasker> i am all for discussing strategy
2010-10-08T19:57:29  <bhasker> but not for releasing fully functional bots
2010-10-08T19:57:38  <jmcarthur> heck, knowing of a strategy and understanding it are different things
2010-10-08T19:57:45  <sigh> hehe
2010-10-08T19:57:53  <McLeopold> I want to release so people can test against it.  I might just have to fallback to tcp server.
2010-10-08T19:57:54  <flag> Plus anyone who had to work to get to where your bot is currently has their work kind of invalidated
2010-10-08T19:57:58  <McLeopold> But not everyone is using it.
2010-10-08T19:58:03  <flag> Because someone just joining is there already
2010-10-08T19:58:10  <tty1> bhasker, releasing bots perpetuates understanding, which makes everyone better
2010-10-08T19:58:26  <jmcarthur> dude i totally heard about alpha beta minimax, so my bot should be at least that good just because i heard about it, right?
2010-10-08T19:58:29  <bhasker> release strategy perpetuates understanding
2010-10-08T19:58:32  <bhasker> not the source code
2010-10-08T19:58:38  <tty1> so if your purpose is to help the greater good, release bots, if its to win, dont.
2010-10-08T19:58:48  <bhasker> the source code is not required
2010-10-08T19:58:52  <bhasker> to improve understanding
2010-10-08T19:58:58  <tty1> bhasker, releasing source code does as well, for those who learn best by reading and understanding source code
2010-10-08T19:58:59  <sigh> flag: if your work is invalidated by someone releasing source code, you haven't worked very hard...
2010-10-08T19:59:10  <bhasker> that can happen after the competition
2010-10-08T19:59:12  <sigh> a lot of what I've learnt is not directly in my code
2010-10-08T19:59:18  <tty1> bhasker, depends on the person, some people think in terms of code
2010-10-08T19:59:19  <bhasker> it would be like releasing the answersheet
2010-10-08T19:59:21  <bhasker> to get 95%
2010-10-08T19:59:23  <bhasker> in an exam
2010-10-08T19:59:27  <McLeopold> if dhartmei would respond to my emails, I could run a McLeopold tcp server
2010-10-08T19:59:32  <bhasker> now you have to work for the remaining 5%
2010-10-08T19:59:37  <bhasker> makes it kinda pointless
2010-10-08T19:59:38  <sigh> bhasker: but there is no 100%
2010-10-08T19:59:47  <sigh> the bar gets raised
2010-10-08T19:59:56  <bhasker> to a point where only very few people can compete
2010-10-08T20:00:00  <bhasker> the competition will die
2010-10-08T20:00:02  <tty1> bhasker, again, like i said, if your goal is to win, or to evaluate skill accuratly, sure.. but if its to perpetuate knowledge then no
2010-10-08T20:00:06  <contestbot> Top 10 players: felixcoto(3842), rsergio(3817), Hazard(3765), ofrias(3742), cfaftw(3732), davidjliu(3687), sequoh(3653), EBraun(3641), savchenko(3632), _iouri_(3631)
2010-10-08T20:00:09  <sigh> why, can't they compete?
2010-10-08T20:00:12  <jmcarthur> sigh: the netflix prize went on forever and they were only trying to improve by 10%
2010-10-08T20:00:14  <flag> It's not invalidated, but it gives everyone else a starting point that the previous group of people didn't have
2010-10-08T20:00:18  <jmcarthur> i don't really want to see this become that
2010-10-08T20:00:31  <McLeopold> sigh: I don't want to raise the bar of bots, I want everyone to be able to analyze how mine plays.
2010-10-08T20:00:41  <tty1> its unfair when it comes to "winning" but still the best way to perpetuate knowledge

2010-10-08T20:03:16  <jmcarthur> i think a couple months is a nice sweet spot for me. i don't want to dedicate my life to it, and there are already other places i can look just for learning
2010-10-08T20:03:30  <jmcarthur> tty1: the tron one didn't really continue that way for long
2010-10-08T20:03:36  <jmcarthur> although that wasn't open source
2010-10-08T20:03:53  <McLeopold> wow: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=380474
2010-10-08T20:03:56  <tty1> jmcarthur, well it is up to the shepards of said project to release it :)

2010-10-08T20:05:00  <McLeopold> CrowBot is like advanced RageBot.
2010-10-08T20:05:13  <McLeopold> It's build on top of my own framework.
2010-10-08T20:05:30  <McLeopold> 241 lines of code
2010-10-08T20:05:43  <jmcarthur> it's EPICRAGEbot

2010-10-08T20:08:27  <McLeopold> Another good game that shatters my preconceptions of this game.
2010-10-08T20:10:01  <McLeopold> that retybok one is amazing
2010-10-08T20:10:39  <bhasker> yea he has a good bot
2010-10-08T20:10:47  <bhasker> it does no staging
2010-10-08T20:10:49  <bhasker> no forwarding
2010-10-08T20:10:56  <bhasker> just builds ships and sends them out in one sweep
2010-10-08T20:11:02  <McLeopold> ohh, I list
2010-10-08T20:11:02  <bhasker> no funnelling at all

2010-10-08T20:11:40  <McLeopold> I can make CrowBot better.

2010-10-08T21:29:54  <javagamer> Hey, I've been away from this contest for a while and I'm wondering if there's an equally easy alternative to ShowGame.jar
2010-10-08T21:33:17  <sigh> javagamer: I use the canvas visualiser: http://github.com/DanielVF/Planet-Wars-Canvas-Visualizer
2010-10-08T21:33:29  <sigh> there are other ones that people have made as well, if you look in the forums
2010-10-08T21:39:20  <javagamer> sigh, how easy is it to use the canvas visualizer from the commandline?
2010-10-08T21:39:58  <sigh> very easy, there is a python script called visualise_locally.py, just put that in the place of ShowGame.jar
2010-10-08T21:40:14  <javagamer> Perfect! Just what I was looking for, thanks :)
2010-10-08T21:47:21  <javagamer> Has PlayGame.jar ever been updated?  I'm still using the original one and I'm assuming by now the fleets disappearing into a planet thing has been fixed.
2010-10-08T21:47:33  <javagamer> Should I just download a new starter pack and replace that file?
2010-10-08T21:57:45  <Janzert> you could try although I don't know of the starter packages ever having been rebuilt. I do think there are some more recent versions stickied in the forum though

2010-10-08T22:04:40  <Zannick> i believe they have been fixed, yes

2010-10-08T23:15:09  <nrub_> i find that one of the most annoying things about the java visualizer that comes with the starter packages is the fact that the aspect ratio is all fucked up
2010-10-08T23:15:30  <nrub_> and that it does not display planet growth info
2010-10-08T23:15:57  <nrub_> I mean how are you gonna tell if one planet is further from another if it

2010-10-08T23:51:33  <Frontier> McLeopold is doing animal experiments again.
2010-10-08T23:52:08  <Frontier> After his worm bot became the plague he invented the crow bot: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=383292
2010-10-08T23:53:17  <jmcarthur> he's excited about that one, too
2010-10-08T23:53:54  <jmcarthur> it works better than he imagined it would
2010-10-08T23:57:11  <Frontier> It akts like worm bot with two attacks instead of one at a atime
2010-10-08T23:59:31  <Frontier> But I guess all of his bots can rely on good heuristics and calculations so the attack plan plays a minor role.
