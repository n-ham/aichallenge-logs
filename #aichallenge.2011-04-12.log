2011-04-12T03:25:37  <Ice_Harley> I think it's because of using Windows instead of Ubuntu.

2011-04-12T05:36:10  <antimatroid> by next i mean the following one
2011-04-12T05:37:21  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid, maybe you know. How can I just use engine without that sandboxes and databases?
2011-04-12T05:38:08  <antimatroid> i'm not overly sure
2011-04-12T05:38:10  <antimatroid> sigh ^^?
2011-04-12T05:38:23  <antimatroid> the play one game scripts have just worked for me on windows and ubuntu
2011-04-12T05:38:52  <sigh> just run the play_one_game script
2011-04-12T05:39:11  <sigh> or look in there to see what command it is doing
2011-04-12T05:39:28  <sigh> only thing you need installed is python
2011-04-12T05:40:06  <Ice_Harley> i have python. I am under Windows. play_one_game returns SyntaxError in Sandbox.py
2011-04-12T05:40:21  <sigh> what is the error?
2011-04-12T05:40:47  <sigh> and what version of python?
2011-04-12T05:41:08  <Ice_Harley> 2.7 and 3.2
2011-04-12T05:41:23  <sigh> make sure that is it not using 3.2
2011-04-12T05:43:21  <sigh> but if it is still not working, please pastebin the error :)
2011-04-12T05:43:23  <Ice_Harley> we need 2.7?
2011-04-12T05:43:26  <Ice_Harley> http://pastebin.com/BnS09zCt
2011-04-12T05:44:27  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: once you get a game to run, grab the replay data out of the replay file in the viewer directory, then paste it into the textbox you get when you open "copy_paste.hmtl" in the visualizer directory and click load text or whatever
2011-04-12T05:44:54  <Ice_Harley> antimatroid: yes, I know this, thanks
2011-04-12T05:45:00  <sigh> Ice_Harley: ah yeah, that looks like it is caused by running python 3
2011-04-12T05:45:19  <antimatroid> sigh: isn't it going to be a bit of an issue telling people they need an old version of python?
2011-04-12T05:45:19  <Ice_Harley> ok, I will try on 2.7

2011-04-12T05:46:22  <antimatroid> which it probably shouldn't be then?
2011-04-12T05:46:45  <antimatroid> for python.exe that is, when running the python bots
2011-04-12T05:47:04  <Ice_Harley> I saw Python31 folder in .cmd and install new version )

2011-04-12T05:47:12  <antimatroid> hehe :P
2011-04-12T05:47:27  <sigh> antimatroid: have to choose one or the other because they are incompatible, and python2 is still being actively developed, it's not deprecated or anything
2011-04-12T05:47:59  <antimatroid> they must have been making some pretty necessary changes to make past versions incompatible?
2011-04-12T05:48:12  <antimatroid> surely that's one of the most undesirable things with a language
2011-04-12T05:48:59  <sigh> it's more of a cleanup of the language, tidy up all the crap that has accumulated :)
2011-04-12T05:49:58  <sigh> there are tools to transition scripts from version 2 to 3 but it still requires manual effort
2011-04-12T05:50:00  <antimatroid> sigh: were you about for my annoying c++ situation yesterday?
2011-04-12T05:50:14  <sigh> what was that?
2011-04-12T05:50:18  <antimatroid> i can't return a reference to an element of a vector of bools due to how they store them
2011-04-12T05:50:28  <antimatroid> so i can't index a matrix of bools as visited[location]
2011-04-12T05:50:32  <antimatroid> i have to use chars
2011-04-12T05:50:42  <sigh> ah, i see
2011-04-12T05:50:43  <antimatroid> or visited[location.row][location.col]
2011-04-12T05:50:49  <sigh> are you tight on space?

2011-04-12T05:51:12  <antimatroid> and reset it etc.
2011-04-12T05:51:26  <sigh> Ice_Harley: what version of the repo are you using?
2011-04-12T05:51:29  <antimatroid> and i might be tight on size when i make a game tree
2011-04-12T05:52:16  <Ice_Harley> sigh: i downloaded it yesterday
2011-04-12T05:54:21  <sigh> hmmm
2011-04-12T05:55:32  <sigh> how can Sandbox raise a name error, if the import failed *that* should have raised an error
2011-04-12T05:55:47  <sigh> :S
2011-04-12T05:58:04  <sigh> worker/engine.py does have the line "from sandbox import Sandbox" at the top right?
2011-04-12T05:58:31  <Ice_Harley> oops, my fault
2011-04-12T05:59:02  <Ice_Harley> I commented it, trying to disable sandboxind and farget to enable
2011-04-12T05:59:13  <sigh> :)
2011-04-12T05:59:31  <Ice_Harley> works now, thanks a lot!
