2011-08-30T05:40:14  <delt0r_> question: if an ant sees some food. Then move out of visual range. This food then gets eaten. Then some new food gets spawned there...
2011-08-30T05:40:37  <delt0r_> does the bot get both a food removed and a food there data?
2011-08-30T05:41:03  <mleise> Oo are u discussing r lines again?
2011-08-30T05:41:27  <antimatroid> delt0r_: 'r' lines no longer exist sorry
2011-08-30T05:41:43  <delt0r_> removed food ?
2011-08-30T05:41:46  <delt0r_> r lines
2011-08-30T05:42:02  <delt0r_> well that kind means i can delete a bit of code
2011-08-30T05:42:18  <delt0r_> I did think that it was odd.
2011-08-30T05:42:20  <antimatroid> are you using the github or beta site specs page?
2011-08-30T05:42:27  <delt0r_> beta site
2011-08-30T05:42:30  <antimatroid> github is the most accurate place to look
2011-08-30T05:42:46  <delt0r_> surly the site is a checkout of the git
2011-08-30T05:43:03  <antimatroid> i've no idea, but amstan has to do something for it to update
2011-08-30T05:43:08  <antimatroid> i haven't changed anything in ages though...
2011-08-30T05:43:14  <antimatroid> but pretty sure i removed the r line stuff
2011-08-30T05:43:15  <delt0r_> i have git version of the code. but i havent' dived into the details... not really strong with python yet
2011-08-30T05:43:25  <delt0r_> k
2011-08-30T05:43:40  <antimatroid> neither, i don't really like python :\
2011-08-30T05:43:45  <delt0r_> anything else removed change? (will check the git anyways... but i can always ask)
2011-08-30T05:43:54  <antimatroid> i think you should be right otherwise
2011-08-30T05:43:56  <delt0r_> like is water only seen once... and only once
2011-08-30T05:43:59  <antimatroid> yep
2011-08-30T05:44:03  <delt0r_> right
2011-08-30T05:44:13  <delt0r_> and do you see dead ants?
2011-08-30T05:44:35  <antimatroid> yes, although come to think of it i don't know what the rules are for seeing it
2011-08-30T05:44:48  <antimatroid> that is on the edge of vision
2011-08-30T05:44:49  <delt0r_> previous turn or something
2011-08-30T05:45:04  <delt0r_> also seems a little odd TNH
2011-08-30T05:45:05  <delt0r_> TBH
2011-08-30T05:45:17  <antimatroid> it's for people to try and track some scoring information
2011-08-30T05:45:43  <antimatroid> and track dead ants from opponents i guess, makes that a bit easier
2011-08-30T05:45:50  <delt0r_> but you can do that without it.. don;t really see it adding anything
2011-08-30T05:46:13  <delt0r_> in fact you still need to track who could attack who for scoring
2011-08-30T05:46:24  <antimatroid> hmmm, you might be right...
2011-08-30T05:46:50  <mleise> delt0r_: when I wrote the live visualizer I realized that it is actually difficult to track died ants without that info
2011-08-30T05:47:25  <antimatroid> if it's already there it doesn't really hurt to leave it right? although i'm now curious about what the rules are for dead ant info
2011-08-30T05:47:28  <delt0r_> not really. you need to know what can and cannot attack... then you know the result of the combat round
2011-08-30T05:47:42  <delt0r_> you need to do this anyway so you can score
2011-08-30T05:47:56  <mleise> at first I didn't include dead ants and I had no idea why some ants disappeared and others stayed. they approach each other at a speed of 0, 1 or 2 squares
2011-08-30T05:48:43  <delt0r_> mm
2011-08-30T05:48:45  <delt0r_> perhaps
2011-08-30T05:48:46  <mleise> so in the replay it wasn't obvious that some ants will be in attack range at the end of the turn
2011-08-30T05:49:06  <antimatroid> i imagine dead ant info is based on vision after battle resolution? do dead ants see other dead ants dying?
2011-08-30T05:49:16  <delt0r_> no
2011-08-30T05:49:24  <delt0r_> its other ants that see it IIRC
2011-08-30T05:49:34  <antimatroid> so you don't necessarily get told all of your ants which die?
2011-08-30T05:49:40  <delt0r_> but it may still be a event in the game log
2011-08-30T05:49:44  <antimatroid> and not told that that ant collided with an enemy?
2011-08-30T05:50:17  <delt0r_> mmm may need to look at the source... does an ant see itself
2011-08-30T05:50:34  <antimatroid> sigh: did you do the dead ant information code?
2011-08-30T05:51:05  <sigh> woah, the last time I touched the code was ages ago
2011-08-30T05:51:30  <antimatroid> yeah i know, just trying to work out what information we think bots will get
2011-08-30T05:51:45  <sigh> oh, I can point you to the place
2011-08-30T05:52:30  <sigh> assuming github loas in my browser :S
2011-08-30T05:52:51  <sigh> what's happened to the contest, I haven't been paying attention
2011-08-30T05:53:23  <antimatroid> not much :P
2011-08-30T05:53:41  <antimatroid> i think delt0r_ is working on a bot manager type program?
2011-08-30T05:54:10  <antimatroid> there are a few things stalling the contest from launching and i'm not sure anyone is working on them, nor am i really sure of what the issues are :\
2011-08-30T05:54:22  <sigh> here is the line dealing with dead ant info: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L400
2011-08-30T05:54:50  <sigh> players see all their own dead ants, plus any others visible from their ants which are currently alive
2011-08-30T05:55:38  <delt0r_> and do alive ants see themselves?
2011-08-30T05:55:42  <antimatroid> based on their positions after moving yes? that seems reasonable
2011-08-30T05:56:00  <antimatroid> delt0r_: live ants don't have dead ant info, you get information about them at the start of each turn though yes
2011-08-30T05:56:01  <sigh> delt0r_: yes, of course
2011-08-30T05:56:18  <antimatroid> sigh: cheers :)
2011-08-30T05:56:27  <delt0r_> right so if I have one ant at 5,5
2011-08-30T05:56:32  <delt0r_> then i will get a line
2011-08-30T05:56:37  <delt0r_> a 5 5 0
2011-08-30T05:56:43  <antimatroid> yep
2011-08-30T05:56:47  <antimatroid> sigh: how's google?
2011-08-30T05:56:55  <delt0r_> cool:just what to be clear
2011-08-30T05:57:11  <sigh> it's fun... I've gotten more up to speed now :)
2011-08-30T05:57:37  <sigh> more time doing stuff, and less time banging my head against the wall :P
2011-08-30T05:58:00  <antimatroid> haha nice
2011-08-30T05:59:07  <antimatroid> summer is close, i cannot wait
2011-08-30T06:00:10  <sigh> heh... I wonder what Sydney summer is like
2011-08-30T06:01:10  <delt0r_> once i would have said hot and humid
2011-08-30T06:01:19  <delt0r_> but this summer i was in japan
2011-08-30T06:01:20  <sigh> but now?
2011-08-30T06:01:32  <delt0r_> now that is *hot* and *humid*
2011-08-30T06:01:39  <sigh> :P
2011-08-30T06:02:01  <antimatroid> heh, sydney gets really hot but not humidy hot from my limited experience
2011-08-30T06:02:17  <delt0r_> last time i was there... it was both..
2011-08-30T06:02:34  <antimatroid> tassie gets stinking hot whenever it's above 30, which is ridiculous
2011-08-30T06:02:39  <delt0r_> but then we had the massive thunderstorms and the hail damaged lots of cars and stuff
2011-08-30T06:02:46  <delt0r_> not really typical i guess
2011-08-30T06:03:12  <delt0r_> I am applying for a job in Tassie
2011-08-30T06:03:27  <antimatroid> what kind of job?
2011-08-30T06:03:32  <antimatroid> tassie's an awesome place :)
2011-08-30T06:03:47  <delt0r_> University lecture
2011-08-30T06:03:53  <delt0r_> lectururue
2011-08-30T06:03:56  <antimatroid> school of computing?
2011-08-30T06:04:11  <delt0r_> bio science IIRC
2011-08-30T06:04:15  <antimatroid> :)
2011-08-30T06:04:16  <delt0r_> perhaps stats?
2011-08-30T06:04:26  <delt0r_> not english ;)
2011-08-30T06:04:26  <antimatroid> i was about to say school of computing is fairly... crap... here :P
2011-08-30T06:04:30  <antimatroid> probably in nicer words
2011-08-30T06:04:38  <delt0r_> meh
2011-08-30T06:04:46  <delt0r_> grass is always greener
2011-08-30T06:04:49  <delt0r_> and all that
2011-08-30T06:05:00  <delt0r_> most places i have been a much of a muchness
2011-08-30T06:05:27  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm fairly biased being maths/theory focused, but they're fairly appliedy and not very rigorous in anything they teach, i'm a pretty big fan of our maths department, not sure about bio
2011-08-30T06:05:42  * mcstar found ~20 definitions of IIRC, wondering what people usually mean by that
2011-08-30T06:05:51  <delt0r_> Syndey uni or new south wales?
2011-08-30T06:06:03  <antimatroid> what?
2011-08-30T06:06:15  <delt0r_> you are in Syndey yes?
2011-08-30T06:06:21  <antimatroid> sigh is, i'm in tassie
2011-08-30T06:06:22  <delt0r_> arn't there a few unis
2011-08-30T06:06:28  <delt0r_> ahh
2011-08-30T06:06:29  <delt0r_> ic
2011-08-30T06:06:35  <antimatroid> lived in tassie my whole life
2011-08-30T06:06:56  <delt0r_> mcstar: If I Recall Correctly
2011-08-30T06:07:25  <mcstar> thx
2011-08-30T06:07:57  <antimatroid> delt0r_: I do know the main stats guy is either taking leave or leaving (I think the later) but i'm not sure if they've replaced him or are going to
2011-08-30T06:08:03  <antimatroid> this is for the maths department
2011-08-30T06:10:27  <mcstar> delt0r_: what kind of education did you get?
2011-08-30T06:10:35  <mcstar> i guess youre older kind of 40ish?
2011-08-30T06:10:54  <antimatroid> applied for*
2011-08-30T06:11:04  <mcstar> hm?
2011-08-30T06:11:18  <antimatroid> delt0r_: there's this http://jobs.admin.utas.edu.au/positions/pd_detail.aspx?PositionId=1934 not sure if that's the one you were applying for? applications close today otherwise :\
2011-08-30T06:12:32  <delt0r_> sorry... got to do real work... I am 36.. did Masters in Physics PhD in Bioinformatics and mathematical biology. Just finishing my 2nd PostDoc
2011-08-30T06:12:35  <delt0r_> gtg
2011-08-30T06:12:42  <mcstar> k
2011-08-30T06:13:07  <mcstar> that is quite interesting though
2011-08-30T06:15:31  <mcstar> antimatroid: i havent really played with your bot
2011-08-30T06:15:50  <mcstar> i hope i will though
2011-08-30T06:16:02  <mcstar> did you upgrade it?

2011-08-30T06:22:21  <mcstar> are you busy with uni?
2011-08-30T06:22:25  <mcstar> stupid question
2011-08-30T06:22:34  <antimatroid> haha yep, second half of honours year
2011-08-30T06:23:04  <mcstar> but still, its not as bad as if you had a job
2011-08-30T06:23:42  <antimatroid> depends, at least with a job you can sort of stop thinking about it at the end of the day
2011-08-30T06:23:45  <mcstar> how many classes you have a day on average?
2011-08-30T06:24:05  <mcstar> nx2x45minutes
2011-08-30T06:24:06  <antimatroid> like 1-2 but i have a thesis to do/write as well
2011-08-30T06:24:12  <antimatroid> 50 minute classes
2011-08-30T06:24:21  <mcstar> well, huge difference :)
2011-08-30T06:24:35  <mcstar> i see how the educational systems of our countries different
2011-08-30T06:24:41  <mcstar> 5 minutes
2011-08-30T06:25:07  <mcstar> ah wait, you dont mean a class is 2x50 mins?
2011-08-30T06:25:42  <antimatroid> i have 3 units this semester, each with 2 lectures a week, but i'm also going to an additional 2 hours of classes for another undergrad unit and most other honours students are only doing 1-2 units this semester
2011-08-30T06:26:02  <antimatroid> a lecture is 50 minutes
2011-08-30T06:26:06  <mcstar> i see
2011-08-30T06:26:18  <mcstar> all our lectures are 2x45, or 3x45 minutes
2011-08-30T06:26:22  <mcstar> mostly the first
2011-08-30T06:26:30  <antimatroid> and we have a g seminar on tuesdays for a few of us on things starting with g, like gombinatorics
2011-08-30T06:26:37  <mcstar> maybe we have a 10min in between them
2011-08-30T06:26:43  <mcstar> 10 min break*
2011-08-30T06:27:07  <antimatroid> in undergrad a maths unit had 3 lectures and a tute a week, but they don't have to pussyfoot around so much anymore and we don't bother with the tute
2011-08-30T06:27:34  <mcstar> what is gombinatorics?
2011-08-30T06:27:40  <antimatroid> it's a joke :)
2011-08-30T06:27:45  <mcstar> i hoped so
2011-08-30T06:27:52  <mcstar> but hey, i cant be sure
2011-08-30T06:28:03  <antimatroid> it's a seminar on things like groups, inverse semigroups etc. then someone made the joke gominatorics, because they called it the g-seminar :)
2011-08-30T06:28:37  <antimatroid> i'm easily amused when it comes to maths :P
2011-08-30T06:28:43  <mcstar> i see
2011-08-30T06:28:48  <mcstar> frankly i dont get that joke
2011-08-30T06:29:19  <mcstar> whats the connection between groups and combinatorics?
2011-08-30T06:29:19  <antimatroid> you know what a haussdorf space is yeah?
2011-08-30T06:29:25  <mcstar> sort of
2011-08-30T06:29:45  <antimatroid> i was told an easy way to remember what they are... because each point is haussdorf (housed of) from each other
2011-08-30T06:30:02  * antimatroid goes to sit in the corner
2011-08-30T06:31:17  <mcstar> yeah, thats what wikipedia says
2011-08-30T06:31:40  <mcstar> off right?
2011-08-30T06:31:53  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-08-30T06:32:27  <mcstar> ok, so how does this relate to combinatorics?
2011-08-30T06:32:44  <antimatroid> it doesn't, i was giving another bad maths joke
2011-08-30T06:33:55  <mcstar> i should read what a Cauchy-net is
2011-08-30T06:34:08  <mcstar> we have a great joke with Cauchy
2011-08-30T06:34:19  <mcstar> im not sure if i can translate it
2011-08-30T06:34:35  <mcstar> How did Cauchy died?
2011-08-30T06:34:42  <mcstar> He got a series.
2011-08-30T06:34:50  <mcstar> (sry, die)
2011-08-30T06:35:28  <mcstar> now, when you say series in hungarian, it can mean a series of gunshots from an automatic weapon
2011-08-30T06:35:46  <mcstar> i hope you get it, its funny when you think of it

2011-08-30T09:11:22  <eashoka> A Good Morning/Evening to All!
2011-08-30T09:16:10  <antimatroid> evening
2011-08-30T09:18:25  <eashoka> antimatroid : any idea of submitting a newer version of your bot ? :-) think the old one has done a commendable job for few months now.... it's getting bit boring out there now.
2011-08-30T09:18:47  <antimatroid> sorry, i'm too busy with uni to touch it
2011-08-30T09:20:54  <CIA-48> aichallenge: Marco Leise epsilon * r8fe526a / (5 files in 2 dirs): removed two unused graphics / improved startup and error logging / fixed: config given as URL parameter completely replaced config as constructor argument - http://git.io/qwxK0w
2011-08-30T09:24:33  <eashoka> antimatroid : yeah of course, I myself might have to stop this soon. wonder whether the contest this time around has gone bit longer than the comfort zone for many ppl. will try to help with bug fixing if I manage to find some time, thing is I'm no good in python. only java.
2011-08-30T09:25:35  <antimatroid> there isn't that much difference to programming in java, c++, python, c# etc. is there?
2011-08-30T09:25:47  <antimatroid> just a matter of working out the syntax most of the time
2011-08-30T09:26:23  <antimatroid> (not that I can, but I don't think it's too hard to switch between them with minimal learning)
2011-08-30T09:26:45  <eashoka> antimatroid : I mean helping with epsilon. when working with a large already done code base, it helps if you are familiar with stuff.
2011-08-30T09:28:26  <eashoka> antimatroid : language basics may be similar across languages but practical series development is largely about experience in SDk's libraries etc.. I think. :-)
2011-08-30T09:30:35  <eashoka>  antimatroid : but you have a point, without giving a new thing a start, it will never happen :-) still, this white space thingy in python is putting me off sometimes. I have spent too much time in java c++ worlds :-(
2011-08-30T09:31:07  <antimatroid> yeah, whitespace with python is one of the things that makes me not like it
2011-08-30T09:31:21  <antimatroid> i like having large chunks of code inside braces
2011-08-30T09:34:30  <eashoka> antimatroid : yeah same here. not exactly like it but rather have gotten too much used to it.

2011-08-30T15:58:34  <UncleVasya> mleise, is there any information about someone's else work on something else but you and visualizer? Some discussions etc.
2011-08-30T15:58:47  <UncleVasya> hi
2011-08-30T15:59:24  <justjuzzy> hi there, I wonder if you could point me into the right direction. I forgot my password on the beta ai challenge.
2011-08-30T15:59:50  <justjuzzy> I cannot find a reset password thing, though I do see something in the source code of github that there is that functionality.
2011-08-30T16:00:01  <justjuzzy> Am I blind??
2011-08-30T16:02:22  <UncleVasya> During beta you can just make a new account without any troubles with administration.
2011-08-30T16:03:54  <justjuzzy> ok, cool. great! Will do.
2011-08-30T16:03:59  <justjuzzy> Shot, enjoy your day

2011-08-30T17:27:18  <mleise> boegel: long time no see
2011-08-30T17:27:34  <boegel> mleise: ?
2011-08-30T17:27:56  <boegel> mleise: I hang out here often, and hassle you guys from time to time, yes :)
2011-08-30T17:28:05  <boegel> mleise: I wish I had time to contribute...
2011-08-30T17:28:19  <boegel> mleise: I hope I can help out with the Haskell starters package
2011-08-30T17:28:51  <mleise> As it stands we have open issues that we need people for that are on vacation :p
2011-08-30T17:29:17  <boegel> mleise: how many people are actively (significantly) contributing?
2011-08-30T17:29:52  <mleise> at the moment? I don't know the number, but you could check the github commit log for names
2011-08-30T17:30:33  <mleise> someone is writing a tcp server now from scratch i think and we get updates to starter bots now and then
2011-08-30T17:31:53  <mleise> oh looks like i should commit in bigger chunks :-[
2011-08-30T17:32:11  <boegel> mleise: good to hear it's still a work in progress
2011-08-30T17:32:20  <boegel> I really loved the previous contest
2011-08-30T17:33:48  <mleise> janzert seems to be the other active committer, not much, but noone has given the project up.
2011-08-30T17:34:13  <boegel> cool
2011-08-30T17:34:23  <boegel> I'll keep checking back from time to time ;)
2011-08-30T17:34:25  <mleise> PlanetWars was special. I believe it is hard to ever match that again.
2011-08-30T17:34:32  <boegel> mleise: howso?
2011-08-30T17:34:40  <boegel> mleise: why was it special?
2011-08-30T17:34:52  <mleise> It was the perfect mix of depth and simplicity
2011-08-30T17:36:08  <boegel> I spent hours on it, much to the frustration of my wife :)
2011-08-30T17:36:21  <mleise> only two players, few possible source planets, everything is known, but still you had these delays when the fleet were in transit that made it all so difficult
2011-08-30T17:36:30  <boegel> but I made a total mess of my code, and wasn't well organized, so I hope I can get another shot at it
2011-08-30T17:36:53  <mleise> Someone already mentioned that he overengineered his code this time
2011-08-30T17:36:55  <boegel> are you saying this ants game is more difficult?
2011-08-30T17:37:22  <mleise> boegel: It is a *lot* more difficult to get a solid base.
2011-08-30T17:38:06  <mleise> You practically need pathfinding and a way to track things that went out of sight, especially food
2011-08-30T17:38:56  <mleise> also you have the map wrapping, so every distance calculation means some sort of min/max/abs calculation
2011-08-30T17:38:57  <boegel> uhu
