2011-09-27T01:33:46  <antimatroid> also, would a "hills remaining" line on the visualiser maybe be useful?
2011-09-27T01:35:47  <Doddzy39> Seems there is a error with the windows tools, in ants.py - when there is more then one ant in the range of food, it tries to call remove_food with the incorrect number of arguments.
2011-09-27T01:46:29  <antimatroid> is LaTeX ever going to work on the actual specs page? or should I just do what I can without it?

2011-09-27T05:05:06  <GreenTea> Hi!
2011-09-27T05:06:10  <GreenTea> who knows does bot control from which hill ant will be spawned after taking food? I found no info about this in specification..
2011-09-27T05:08:25  <antimatroid> GreenTea: it spawns at the ant hill which spawned an ant longest ago
2011-09-27T05:08:28  <antimatroid> it breaks ties randomly
2011-09-27T05:10:05  <GreenTea> random is not good. and if my and is directly on the hill. then this hill can't spawn?
2011-09-27T05:10:12  <GreenTea> * my ant

2011-09-27T05:15:54  <antimatroid> GreenTea: yeah, you can control where it spawns by placing ants on hills if you want
2011-09-27T05:16:08  <antimatroid> i didn't do it, but i'm not really sure how else it would be done that's reasonably easy?
2011-09-27T05:16:51  <antimatroid> i guess an alternative would be to tell people how many ants they can spawn and let them execute spawn orders
2011-09-27T05:17:05  <antimatroid> i'll run that by mcleopold
2011-09-27T05:17:20  <antimatroid> then the starter bots could implement what the engine currently does

2011-09-27T05:24:55  <antimatroid> yeah, i always wanted it to be like caves
2011-09-27T05:25:57  <patrisk> Are hills supposed to spawn on water?
2011-09-27T05:26:53  <antimatroid> that was my bad
2011-09-27T05:27:06  <patrisk> In game #741, xkor-RU spawns with two ant hills on water, with one of them being surrounded
2011-09-27T05:27:10  <antimatroid> i updated my map generator last night to add multiple hills per ant and forgot to make sure i was adding them to land squares
2011-09-27T05:27:24  <antimatroid> i've since updated the generator on github but those maps are still there

2011-09-27T08:51:33  <cichociemno> antimatroid: cause normally if in turn N my ant capture food, then in turn N+1 I got one extra ant. So it will be requiring to putting ant and ordering them in the N+1 turn.

2011-09-27T10:26:13  <antimatroid> i am
2011-09-27T10:26:58  <McLeopold> so, did you read the logs about xathis squatting trick?
2011-09-27T10:27:14  <antimatroid> McLeopold: for spawning, have you considered making bots execute spawn moves themselves? so for the input of each turn tell them the maximum number of ants they are allowed to spawn? and only allow one ant to spawn at an ant hill each turn?
2011-09-27T10:27:50  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes, but that would change the bot input.  I think it takes the game to the complexity that jeff doesn't want
2011-09-27T10:28:09  <antimatroid> i was thinking the starter bots could implement what the engine does now
2011-09-27T10:28:17  <antimatroid> then people who don't want to touch it could just leave it
2011-09-27T10:28:20  <antimatroid> but yeah
2011-09-27T10:28:21  <McLeopold> for casual coders, they don't need to care where the ants spawn at and they can just run around with ants, and the spawning will be fairly even
2011-09-27T10:28:56  <McLeopold> right now, if you care to, you can control the spawning by just leaving an ant on top of the hill to block it
2011-09-27T10:29:19  <antimatroid> that's messy to track and requires holding an ant next to hills though
2011-09-27T10:29:25  <antimatroid> it's not really ideal :P
2011-09-27T10:29:41  <McLeopold> it's 1 ant at each hill, not a big deal
2011-09-27T10:29:44  <antimatroid> it would also solve the hill squating problem, although i don't think that's really much of a problem
2011-09-27T10:29:56  <McLeopold> I already have a good solution for that
2011-09-27T10:30:14  <McLeopold> if your ant dies on the hill, the hill is destroyed
2011-09-27T10:30:23  <McLeopold> it doesn't actually make it any easier to kill hills
2011-09-27T10:30:45  <McLeopold> spawning happens, then moves, then attack, so the hill owner would have to let the hill die
2011-09-27T10:30:53  <antimatroid> sort of does if they kill it when there's a battle around the hill doesn't it?
2011-09-27T10:31:09  <McLeopold> nope
2011-09-27T10:31:14  <McLeopold> move before attack
2011-09-27T10:31:23  <McLeopold> you still have total control
2011-09-27T10:31:39  <McLeopold> if you want to stop the siphoning, you can do it
2011-09-27T10:32:47  <antimatroid> hmmm okay, it sounds like a lot of messy edge cases would be added though
2011-09-27T10:33:06  <McLeopold> they are edge cases, and I don't want to change the bot output for edge cases
2011-09-27T10:33:09  <antimatroid> my guesses are, handling that, worrying about defending approaching enemies with one ant on a hill in case it gets taken out
2011-09-27T10:33:55  <antimatroid> i don't really mind though
2011-09-27T10:34:02  <McLeopold> in the strategy guide, we simple explain that you should leave 1 ant next to each hill in a multi-hill map to control
2011-09-27T10:34:25  <McLeopold> it's really not that hard to implement
2011-09-27T10:34:54  <McLeopold> if you have the logic to handle where you think spawning should occur, you should be able to control a gatekeeper

2011-09-27T10:35:27  <McLeopold> sir_macelon: does the no food bug still happen with the new engine?
2011-09-27T10:36:02  <sir_macelon> yes, I saw it happening recently also
2011-09-27T10:36:17  <sir_macelon> but I didn't note down the game id
2011-09-27T10:36:51  <sir_macelon> it is mainly related to the "hidden" food_visible parameter
2011-09-27T10:37:49  <sir_macelon> McLeopold: btw. have you noticed one worker down?

2011-09-27T12:09:48  <McLeopold> janzert: so, I'm inclined to let the xathis siphon happen rather than implement any more bot output
2011-09-27T12:10:12  <McLeopold> or change the rule so that an enemy ant in attack range will raze a hill
2011-09-27T12:10:23  <janzert> nah, I'd rather leave it
2011-09-27T12:10:30  <olexs1> what's xathis siphon?
2011-09-27T12:10:36  <McLeopold> let the siphon happen?
2011-09-27T12:10:53  <mleise> What was the result of the launch meeting?
2011-09-27T12:11:28  <mleise> Will emails be sent to everyone, to notify them of the start?
2011-09-27T12:11:47  <janzert> I was thinking about adding something like "s row col priority", and the priority of each hill increases every turn by one and is reset by an ant occupying the hill
2011-09-27T12:12:26  <McLeopold> that's too complicated
2011-09-27T12:12:35  <janzert> so the everything would be the same as it is now if the bot doesn't issue an order but it can explicitly set the order if it wants to
2011-09-27T12:12:37  <janzert> ?
2011-09-27T12:12:38  <janzert> really
2011-09-27T12:12:39  <janzert> ?
2011-09-27T12:12:46  <McLeopold> bot output needs to be simple
2011-09-27T12:13:04  <janzert> that's no more complicated than an ant move order
2011-09-27T12:13:06  <McLeopold> this is really an edge case, and I don't want to change the fundamentals just to support an edge case
2011-09-27T12:13:50  <janzert> ok, I'm still don't really see why multi-hills really add anything to the game
2011-09-27T12:14:11  <McLeopold> janzert: it does, I plan to have a combinations tesselation
2011-09-27T12:14:43  <janzert> it'd be nice of the visualizer linked to the map page
2011-09-27T12:14:47  <janzert> of->if
2011-09-27T12:15:49  <janzert> http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=784&user=26 has a map with a hill in water, I think I already took that out of rotation this morning, but I'm not sure :}
2011-09-27T12:16:05  <McLeopold> antimatroid already fixed it
2011-09-27T12:16:19  <janzert> fixed the generator you mean?
2011-09-27T12:16:31  <janzert> yeah, I just generated the current set before that yesterday
2011-09-27T12:17:14  <McLeopold> does a low priority come first or last?
2011-09-27T12:17:39  <janzert> ?
2011-09-27T12:17:43  <janzert> low priority where?
2011-09-27T12:17:48  <McLeopold> for the "s row col priority"
2011-09-27T12:18:08  <janzert> oh, closer to 0 zero go later
2011-09-27T12:18:26  <janzert> basically highest priority gets the spawn, but that will set it back to 0
2011-09-27T12:18:43  <janzert> so then the next highest will get the next unless another order is issued
2011-09-27T12:18:48  <McLeopold> so you'd have to issue an s order every turn if you want to turn a hill off

2011-09-27T12:19:40  <janzert> only one spawn per turn right?
2011-09-27T12:19:44  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-27T12:19:47  <janzert> oh
2011-09-27T12:19:48  <McLeopold> 1 per turn per hill
2011-09-27T12:20:05  <janzert> I thought it was one per turn only
2011-09-27T12:20:29  <McLeopold> so, my scheme still makes more sense, to me at least

2011-09-27T12:21:21  <McLeopold> it makes the game a little faster, by 2 moves per hill raze :)
2011-09-27T12:22:20  <janzert> I thought we had decided multiple hills spawning was unwanted the other night
2011-09-27T12:22:29  <McLeopold> no, we didn't
2011-09-27T12:22:41  <McLeopold> what time, I'll read the logs :)
2011-09-27T12:22:50  <janzert> heh, no idea :P
2011-09-27T12:24:01  <janzert> oh
2011-09-27T12:24:13  <ChrisH> janzert: I agree with you that multiple hills do not make the game "better"
2011-09-27T12:24:47  <janzert> watching bot behavior the other night I wonder if we should tell a bot when a hill is dead
2011-09-27T12:24:59  <ChrisH> It is a lot harder to follow what is going on in the game when watching the visualizer.
2011-09-27T12:25:10  <ChrisH> when there are a lot of hills
2011-09-27T12:25:10  <janzert> i.e. not just that a hill came into view but whether the hill is active or not
2011-09-27T12:25:21  <McLeopold> it gets a hill line each turn, just like food, so the bots would have the same delima
2011-09-27T12:25:39  <ChrisH> My current submission figures out when hills are dead
2011-09-27T12:25:56  <ChrisH> because once a hill is dead it is no longer sent in the input when that square is visible.
2011-09-27T12:25:59  <McLeopold> janzert: dead hills are not sent to the bots
2011-09-27T12:26:03  <janzert> ahh
2011-09-27T12:26:04  <janzert> ok
2011-09-27T12:26:13  <ChrisH> just like eaten food
2011-09-27T12:26:20  <janzert> I just saw some bots go and camp out on dead hills
2011-09-27T12:26:29  <janzert> I thought it might be because they were still seeing it
2011-09-27T12:26:32  <janzert> but I guess not
2011-09-27T12:26:37  <McLeopold> what game?
2011-09-27T12:26:42  <ChrisH> no, they are just remembering it.
2011-09-27T12:26:54  <janzert> heh, I've watched a couple dozen
2011-09-27T12:26:55  <ChrisH> My first version that was hill aware did that too.

2011-09-27T12:27:25  <janzert> ok
2011-09-27T12:27:30  <janzert> probably what it was
2011-09-27T12:28:32  <McLeopold> janzert: how about no spawning if an enemy is in range of the hill?
2011-09-27T12:29:06  <janzert> hmm
2011-09-27T12:29:24  <McLeopold> it makes defense just a little harder
2011-09-27T12:29:26  <janzert> not sure one way or the other
2011-09-27T12:29:34  <McLeopold> but only if you were on the line
2011-09-27T12:29:42  <ChrisH> what about if it is your last hill?
2011-09-27T12:30:07  <McLeopold> then you're about to get eliminated :)
2011-09-27T12:30:14  <ChrisH> not necessarily
2011-09-27T12:30:32  <McLeopold> sacrifice some ants to get it active again
2011-09-27T12:30:38  <ChrisH> it could be a single enemy bot shutting the hill down that wouldn't be able to capture it by itself.
2011-09-27T12:30:45  <McLeopold> depends on if you have much in the hive
2011-09-27T12:30:59  <ChrisH> that's been my point in this discussion
2011-09-27T12:31:01  <McLeopold> 1 ant can always raze a hill
2011-09-27T12:31:08  <ChrisH> I still don't get that.
2011-09-27T12:31:15  <janzert> hmm, I see in our original conversation we had discussed using hill with closest friendly to set spawn
2011-09-27T12:31:24  <McLeopold> we did
2011-09-27T12:31:35  <janzert> but that sounds expensive for the engine to do
2011-09-27T12:31:35  <McLeopold> but I didn't want to implement the search :)
2011-09-27T12:31:40  <janzert> right :)
2011-09-27T12:32:06  <McLeopold> sitting ants on top of hills to block just makes so much sense, plus it is easy to see in the visualizer
2011-09-27T12:32:20  <McLeopold> jeff doesn't want hidden state, remember
2011-09-27T12:32:41  <janzert> but the state is already there
2011-09-27T12:32:50  <janzert> it's just not directly manipulable by the bot
2011-09-27T12:32:52  <McLeopold> hidden from the visualizer
2011-09-27T12:32:58  <janzert> it is
2011-09-27T12:34:22  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-27T12:34:38  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I really don't want to be a pest. But I'm still not sure I understand your assertion that a single enemy ant can raze a hill with an ant on top and more in the hive ready to spawn.
2011-09-27T12:34:41  <janzert> I'm fine with leaving it for now though
2011-09-27T12:35:24  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Could you step me through how that is resolved?
2011-09-27T12:35:42  <McLeopold> janzert: I think I'll implement my way.  If it becomes a big issues, we can just drop multiple hills.
2011-09-27T12:35:44  <janzert> heh, found it ;). You did say 1 spawn per turn not hill
2011-09-27T12:35:59  <McLeopold> janzert: it must have been a typo :P
2011-09-27T12:36:11  <janzert> (1:26:12 PM) McLeopold: okay, 1 per turn, not per hill, least recently spawned?
2011-09-27T12:36:16  <janzert> :P
2011-09-27T12:36:26  <McLeopold> oh, that was way back
2011-09-27T12:36:32  <janzert> hehe
2011-09-27T12:36:53  <janzert> I also then said
2011-09-27T12:37:02  <McLeopold> okay, if 1 per turn, and stepping on a hill to activate, then how do you switch?
2011-09-27T12:37:02  <janzert> (1:26:52 PM) janzert: ok, since I don't expect per turn or per hill to be much different in practice
2011-09-27T12:37:29  <McLeopold> assuming a constance flow in the hive
2011-09-27T12:37:30  <McLeopold> constant

2011-09-27T12:39:11  <janzert> if we need to change I'd rather add an explicit order for the bot to issue

2011-09-27T12:49:58  <janzert> not sure if this is purely a visualizer thing, but I wonder if it makes sense to not show an ants hive size after its last hill is destroyed
2011-09-27T12:50:10  <janzert> since it can never spawn those anyway
2011-09-27T12:54:53  <janzert> here's one where paratrechina seems to hover on and around a dead hill http://antsbeta.janzert.com/visualizer.php?game=955
2011-09-27T12:55:05  <janzert> from about move 179 till almost the end of the game

2011-09-27T12:58:51  <McLeopold> janzert: raze happens after attack, and you must have a surviving ant
2011-09-27T12:59:10  <janzert> hmm?
2011-09-27T12:59:18  <McLeopold> janzert: so, if you can maintain ants in the hive, or always gather enough food, your hill can't be razed
2011-09-27T12:59:34  <McLeopold> since an new ant will always spawn just before move
2011-09-27T12:59:55  <McLeopold> if you don't move it off, an enemy can't move on to the hill
2011-09-27T13:00:05  <janzert> but if the attacker has two ants adjacent neither will die and one can step on
2011-09-27T13:00:12  <McLeopold> if it does, it collides and doesn't survive to the raze phase
2011-09-27T13:00:18  <janzert> ahh
2011-09-27T13:00:20  <janzert> cool
2011-09-27T13:00:30  <McLeopold> nope, an new ant always spawns
2011-09-27T13:00:50  <janzert> I had thought it would work out that way until someone convinced me otherwise :P
2011-09-27T13:01:12  <McLeopold> so, is this good? :)
2011-09-27T13:01:15  <janzert> I'm happier with it that way by the way
2011-09-27T13:01:23  <janzert> yes, I think so
2011-09-27T13:01:45  <McLeopold> if I implement my idea, it break
2011-09-27T13:01:46  <McLeopold> s
2011-09-27T13:02:10  <janzert> the stopping the hill from spawning if the ant dies idea?
2011-09-27T13:02:25  <McLeopold> actually, its a virtual win for the attackers, given enough time
2011-09-27T13:02:28  <janzert> yeah, I think probably just leave it alone for now
2011-09-27T13:02:59  <McLeopold> to move, or not to move
2011-09-27T13:03:22  <McLeopold> if you move off, and the opponent moves on, you lose
2011-09-27T13:03:35  <McLeopold> if you stay and the opponent stays, you lose
2011-09-27T13:03:46  <ChrisH> so you need to stay on the hill and hope you can survive until reinforcements arrive
2011-09-27T13:03:48  <McLeopold> there is no nash equilibrium
2011-09-27T13:04:09  <janzert> I don't understand that first scenario statement
2011-09-27T13:04:11  <McLeopold> it's just a guessing game, but once the attacker guesses right, the game is over and he wins
2011-09-27T13:04:40  <ChrisH> unless external reinforcements (from another hill) can save the day.
2011-09-27T13:04:40  <janzert> you can't move off before dieing
2011-09-27T13:04:54  <janzert> can you?
2011-09-27T13:05:03  <McLeopold> move before attack
2011-09-27T13:05:15  <McLeopold> spawn on hill -> move -> attack phase
2011-09-27T13:05:24  <ChrisH> the xathis siphon was predicated on there being a small number of enemy ants squatting on the hill
2011-09-27T13:05:58  <ChrisH> so if there are some friendly ants that can maneuver to force them out of the area or kill them, then the squatted hill could be liberated.
2011-09-27T13:06:24  <ChrisH> currently, that is
2011-09-27T13:06:30  <McLeopold> yes, now I've changed my mind on that possibility
2011-09-27T13:06:43  <McLeopold> but, if the bot doesn't want to try and save the hill?
2011-09-27T13:06:46  <ChrisH> I'm glad we agree.
2011-09-27T13:06:49  <McLeopold> if it would rather have the ants?
2011-09-27T13:07:05  <ChrisH> not sure what to do there.
2011-09-27T13:07:27  <McLeopold> oh, I know
2011-09-27T13:07:30  <ChrisH> othere than allowing the bot to control spawning as someone suggested
2011-09-27T13:07:42  <McLeopold> how about a hill won't spawn if there is a dead ant on it
2011-09-27T13:07:54  <janzert> if that needs to be fixed then I still think an explicit order is the best most straightforward solution
2011-09-27T13:08:29  *** eashoka <eashoka!708740d6@gateway/web/freenode/ip.112.135.64.214> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-27T13:08:30  <janzert> how does a dead ant get removed?
2011-09-27T13:08:34  <ChrisH> that's basically back to your first suggestion then McLeopold
2011-09-27T13:08:41  <ChrisH> isn't it?
2011-09-27T13:09:16  <ChrisH> assuming dead ants disappear in one of the phases each turn
2011-09-27T13:10:27  <ChrisH> or, if the enemy chooses not to raze the hill, then it lowers the hill's spawn rate to every other turn.
2011-09-27T13:12:49  <McLeopold> no, it doesn't kill the hill
2011-09-27T13:12:59  <McLeopold> janzert: dead ants only last 1 turn
2011-09-27T13:13:24  <ChrisH> not exactly, but it gives the enemy a chance to rzae the hill after a 1 turn delay.
2011-09-27T13:13:25  <McLeopold> yeah, lowers the spawn rate
2011-09-27T13:13:29  <janzert> means keep some ants in the hive is no longer a last ditch hill defense
2011-09-27T13:14:30  <janzert> lets just leave it alone for the moment
2011-09-27T13:14:42  <McLeopold> ok
2011-09-27T13:14:42  <McLeopold> siphon is in
2011-09-27T13:15:10  <ChrisH> that seems like the best decision to me.
2011-09-27T13:15:16  <ChrisH> (as if you cared)
2011-09-27T13:15:34  <McLeopold> it's got some cool consequences
2011-09-27T13:15:38  <ChrisH> but I'm with janzert about multiple hills being less interesting
2011-09-27T13:16:20  <McLeopold> just wait on that, we can always not include maps, but rules changes need to be fixed now
2011-09-27T13:16:38  <janzert> interesting http://pastebin.com/Pesgywzv
2011-09-27T13:16:39  <ChrisH> I agree completely on that point.
2011-09-27T13:16:43  <McLeopold> the hill siphone also works on 1 hill maps

2011-09-27T13:17:02  <ChrisH> no disagreement from me there McLeopold
2011-09-27T13:17:27  <janzert> that's the count of games for each end condition currently
2011-09-27T13:17:45  <McLeopold> cool, I'm glad some rank cutoffs are in there
2011-09-27T13:18:03  <janzert> quite a few really
2011-09-27T13:18:44  <McLeopold> did you look at the games?
2011-09-27T13:19:03  <janzert> especially considering it wasn't working until not that long ago
2011-09-27T13:19:09  <janzert> I've seen a few
2011-09-27T13:19:28  <ChrisH> but the siphon issue is less of a problem on single hill maps because it doesn't allow an enemy to squat on a highly exposed hill to harm an otherwise well protected colony, and the multi-hill maps tend to have a lot of difficult to defend hills.
2011-09-27T13:19:32  <janzert> it'd be great for the visualizer and game list to start displaying it
2011-09-27T13:20:08  <McLeopold> janzert: just to make sure we agree -> if there is a bot with a hill that can still gain in rank, then the game continues, otherwise it ends
2011-09-27T13:20:10  <ChrisH> and now I'll be quite about that topic. ;)
2011-09-27T13:20:25  <ChrisH> err, quiet
2011-09-27T13:20:53  <janzert> if there is only one bot that has a hill remaining then the game ends immediately
2011-09-27T13:21:05  <McLeopold> because it can't gain in rank
2011-09-27T13:21:16  <janzert> right
2011-09-27T13:21:35  <McLeopold> okay, we agree, last night I think we argued the same thing :)

2011-09-27T13:22:58  <ChrisH> it would seem possible for the ranks of the other bots to shuffle if they could kill some hills though, doesn't it?
2011-09-27T13:23:13  <janzert> did you see my bug report about bots not losing points for hills razed after their own death
2011-09-27T13:23:23  <McLeopold> yes, but if they lost their hills, we deny them the chance
2011-09-27T13:23:31  <McLeopold> no
2011-09-27T13:23:35  <ChrisH> ok, as long as that is in the rules.
2011-09-27T13:23:53  <McLeopold> janzert: that is a visualizer thing

2011-09-27T13:23:58  <janzert> ok
2011-09-27T13:23:59  <ChrisH> i noticed that too janzert
2011-09-27T13:24:02  <janzert> wasn't sure
2011-09-27T13:24:23  <McLeopold> I cut off the score history to fix the graph, but I think mleise uses something else now
2011-09-27T13:24:51  <janzert> they do seem to lose 1 point at the moment of elimination though
2011-09-27T13:24:56  <mleise> not yet, no. But you said you added something, right?
2011-09-27T13:25:06  <McLeopold> yes
2011-09-27T13:25:26  <McLeopold> actually, I stop adding to the score history, the modify the last one to be what it was at the end
2011-09-27T13:25:42  <McLeopold> so it looks like they lose all the points at the point of death
2011-09-27T13:25:42  <McLeopold> which is something I like
2011-09-27T13:26:10  <janzert> mleise: two feature requests too, I can add them in the bug tracker if you like, a link to the map page and display of the cutoff reason
2011-09-27T13:26:26  <McLeopold> janzert: let's move that out of the visualizer?
2011-09-27T13:26:31  <mleise> yeah probably
2011-09-27T13:26:58  <janzert> McLeopold: hmm, then the score isn't being calculated properly

2011-09-27T14:06:14  <McLeopold> yes :D
2011-09-27T14:06:17  <olexs1> also, games on such maps (with many players and multiple spawns per player spread everywhere) are very difficult to watch properly.
2011-09-27T14:06:30  <McLeopold> difficult how?
2011-09-27T14:06:53  <olexs1> when the map is big, one can only just see the hills
2011-09-27T14:07:14  <olexs1> there is little indication in the moment where a hill is destroyed, so one has to scroll back and forth through the timeline
2011-09-27T14:07:48  <olexs1> find the moment where the score increased, and then search the map to see where it happened. ants of all 8 colors spread evenly across the screen don't help :)
2011-09-27T14:07:48  <McLeopold> maybe a giant ping on the map that lasts a few seconds?
2011-09-27T14:07:53  <mleise> I know what you want! You want a proximity indicator on the map that shows up when an enemy ant approaches a hill
2011-09-27T14:09:04  <olexs1> any of those two ideas would help
2011-09-27T14:09:55  <olexs1> for the proximity indicator, first thing that comes to mind is Air Control game for iphone/android/..., if you know what I'm talking about
2011-09-27T14:10:02  <janzert> McLeopold: that pastebin shows false for me
2011-09-27T14:10:16  <McLeopold> which means the rank can't change

2011-09-27T14:15:29  <janzert> yeah
2011-09-27T14:15:42  <janzert> for the open map I went with number of players and size
2011-09-27T14:16:50  <olexs1> about maps... since the game now is quite similar to "proper" strategy games, one could try and replicate a few "classic" maps from starcraft, c&c and others
2011-09-27T14:17:05  <olexs1> the symmetric ones, there are a lot of those. would add some fun factor

2011-09-27T15:21:17  <janzert> My understanding is it is like food and is sent every turn
2011-09-27T15:21:26  <janzert> while the hill is active that is

2011-09-27T15:27:10  <janzert> it should be hill.owner == player and hill.killed_by is None right?

2011-09-27T15:29:05  <gattschardo> could you change the TargetCompiler to ExternalCompiler in compile.sh?
2011-09-27T15:29:07  <janzert> oh
2011-09-27T15:29:29  <gattschardo> you can look at the output in my account, it's "ydinic"
2011-09-27T15:29:41  <janzert> any idea why isn't TargetCompiler working though?

2011-09-27T15:33:35  <McLeopold> except the cutoff reason will now be correct
2011-09-27T15:33:40  <janzert> it does, though
2011-09-27T15:34:02  <janzert> the lone survivor is calculated wrong if you take it out and doesn't get the remaining hill scores
2011-09-27T15:34:14  <McLeopold> the hills are already done
2011-09-27T15:34:34  <janzert> the case is that hills are left but not ants
2011-09-27T15:34:34  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-09-27T15:35:00  <janzert> i.e. a few hills without ants and a few ants without hills
2011-09-27T15:35:07  <janzert> that's why I changed it
2011-09-27T15:35:33  <gattschardo> janzert: i just looked at the target compiler -- it's just the wrong thing to use for erlang, because it passes a "-o" flag on the command line
2011-09-27T15:36:04  <gattschardo> so just changing it to the ExternalCompiler is the correct fix
2011-09-27T15:36:07  <McLeopold> so it could lose?
2011-09-27T15:36:49  <janzert> if the game went on, but the game shouldn't continue since all the other bots alive don't have a hill
2011-09-27T15:37:19  <janzert> at least it could still theoretically go down in ranking if the game played out
2011-09-27T15:38:09  <janzert> gattschardo: that is just a default argument so you can overide it if wanted
2011-09-27T15:38:25  <gattschardo> yeah, but it doesn't need any
2011-09-27T15:38:34  <janzert> for Erlang just "" is appropriate then
2011-09-27T15:38:46  <janzert> I can add and commit that now if you want
2011-09-27T15:38:47  <gattschardo> okay, you can also use that

2011-09-27T15:40:30  <janzert> the game should only be decided to continue by ants that still have active hills, that was the compromise between not eliminating them entirely
2011-09-27T15:40:40  <janzert> and was your idea ;)
2011-09-27T15:40:41  <McLeopold> close, but wrong
2011-09-27T15:41:00  <janzert> and I like it so much :P
2011-09-27T15:41:02  <McLeopold> the ant may not be in the lead
2011-09-27T15:41:08  <McLeopold> bot
2011-09-27T15:41:27  <janzert> doesn't have to be, it should just be considered the lone survivor at that stage
2011-09-27T15:41:32  <McLeopold> so, there are still 2 bots alive, 1 with a hill, 1 without *and* the rank is not stabilized
2011-09-27T15:42:00  <McLeopold> the only bot with a hill can still overtake, so the game continues
2011-09-27T15:42:07  <janzert> it'll cut out a lot of pointless moves
2011-09-27T15:42:22  <McLeopold> it gives a win to a dumb bot
2011-09-27T15:42:32  <janzert> you consider it lone survivor and the game ends and it gets the points for all remaining hills
2011-09-27T15:42:41  <janzert> that's what the lone survivor ending is
2011-09-27T15:42:49  <McLeopold> not in my book
2011-09-27T15:43:26  <janzert> but it explicitly is already, look at finish_game (I didn't even write that code)

2011-09-27T15:44:31  <janzert> but it is the same outcome as if the game continues and it does destroy all the remaining hills
2011-09-27T15:44:48  <McLeopold> yes, but it still needs to do that
2011-09-27T15:45:11  <McLeopold> the bot without a hill that has ants is in the lead
2011-09-27T15:45:20  <janzert> but it already showed that it can hang onto ants and hills
2011-09-27T15:45:32  <janzert> I think the above scenario is going to be quite rare
2011-09-27T15:45:39  <McLeopold> or that it did get any attention

2011-09-27T15:46:31  <janzert> and it has the nice compromise position of not allowing bots without hills to prolong the game

2011-09-27T15:47:15  <McLeopold> I don't
2011-09-27T15:47:29  <janzert> then let's just eliminate them :P

2011-09-27T15:47:55  <McLeopold> which means the game will go the full length
2011-09-27T15:47:59  <janzert> then hang onto your hill ;)
2011-09-27T15:48:09  <McLeopold> I just don't agree
2011-09-27T15:48:25  <janzert> nope if they are eliminated when the hill is dead then we have lone survivor again
2011-09-27T15:48:38  <McLeopold> We are saving so many turns with cutoff and max_turn per map, we should stop messing up the rules just for a few cycles
2011-09-27T15:48:52  <_flag> What timezone is the server in? And shouldn't that be localized? Perhaps something like "x hous ago"
2011-09-27T15:49:06  <janzert> server is on GMT now
2011-09-27T15:49:20  <McLeopold> amstan: ?
2011-09-27T15:50:59  <janzert> I'm almost sure the "compromise" position always ends the game at the same scenarios eliminating players does
2011-09-27T15:51:33  <janzert> but allows bots that lost their hills to keep moving their ants and attempting to gain points in the meantime
2011-09-27T15:51:43  <McLeopold> I'm not worried about what normally happens, I don't want to hand a game to a bot that doesn't deserve it, it screws up the rankings with noise
2011-09-27T15:52:08  <janzert> there are always going to be bots that get games that don't deserve it
2011-09-27T15:52:29  <McLeopold> We should decrease that number, not increase it
2011-09-27T15:53:25  <janzert> this isn't going to effect that part a whole lot either way though, and I'm willing to add a little noise for more samples

2011-09-27T17:43:23  <xathis> so if you step on a hill and at the same turn an ant spawns on the hill than they both die?
2011-09-27T17:43:42  <McLeopold> well, the ant spawns first
2011-09-27T17:43:42  <McLeopold> so it is a collision
2011-09-27T17:44:01  <McLeopold> razing happens after than, so you'd have to have a clear hill to raze

2011-09-27T19:32:21  <mleise> the dashed ones make it easier to spot hills especially on low resolutions
2011-09-27T19:32:42  <mleise> the others show when an enemy ant gets close to a hill, so you see where the action is going on
2011-09-27T19:32:54  <amstan> they're kinda intrusive though
2011-09-27T19:33:20  <amstan> you shouldn't have them if there's only one enemy ant around it
2011-09-27T19:33:29  <amstan> however, if that green thing comes, sure
2011-09-27T19:34:34  <mleise> one enemy ant can easily raze the hill
2011-09-27T19:37:14  <mleise> I think it is the maze maps, that make the circles look intrusive, because they tend to stay when an enemy is behind water and miles away.

2011-09-27T19:42:06  <amstan> McLeopold: should i tell them to follow the python starter package again? is there a place with the exact new game rules in?
2011-09-27T19:43:00  <mleise> amstan: I just added a myHills and emenyHills array to my bot and parsed them the same way as ants.
2011-09-27T19:43:42  <mleise> In this game the circles don't looks so intrusive: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=1094
2011-09-27T19:45:31  <amstan> Token WTF? OMG "go"
2011-09-27T19:45:39  <McLeopold> amstan:  https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Starter-Pack-Guide
2011-09-27T19:45:56  <antimatroid> mleise: that's what i did for the starter bot
2011-09-27T19:46:15  <antimatroid> and marked the squares as hills with a hillPlayer variable
2011-09-27T19:46:21  <antimatroid> c++ starter bot*
2011-09-27T19:48:09  <ChrisH> McLeopold: I don't know if this is a scoring problem or not, http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=1016&user=3
2011-09-27T19:48:40  <ChrisH> McLeopold: Notice how one of the bots has timed out during initialization and only has 1 point to start the game.
2011-09-27T19:48:58  <antimatroid> is it an issue that players can now end with a minus score?
2011-09-27T19:49:12  <antimatroid> i think we tried to avoid that previously?
2011-09-27T19:49:27  <ChrisH> McLeopold: But what's also interesting is that that point never leaves the display, while other bots's scores disappear when they are eliminated.
2011-09-27T19:49:30  <McLeopold> mleise: can you keep the circles in the main map, not the shadow?
2011-09-27T19:50:00  <amstan> McLeopold: python starter package is all up to date, right?
2011-09-27T19:50:20  <McLeopold> amstan: except for 1 bug, yes, I'm not sure if I commited the fix yet
2011-09-27T19:50:27  <amstan> McLeopold: please do soonb
2011-09-27T19:50:37  <amstan> McLeopold: since i'm referring it in my message
2011-09-27T19:50:42  <antimatroid> amstan: just tell them to look at the c++ one :P
2011-09-27T19:50:45  <amstan> antimatroid: ok
2011-09-27T19:50:51  <mleise> McLeopold: I'm not sure I understand you. There is no shadow layer.
2011-09-27T19:50:58  <antimatroid> specifically, state.h, state.cc and square.h
2011-09-27T19:51:23  <antimatroid> mleise: i think he means the border?
2011-09-27T19:52:03  <mleise> ah right, yeah I noticed that, but the border is just a copy of what is rendered in the center

2011-09-27T19:52:48  <McLeopold> ChrisH: as luck would have it, he only lost 4 hills :)
2011-09-27T19:53:39  <McLeopold> mleise: the repeated sections
2011-09-27T19:53:43  <mleise> McLeopold: It is possible, but not straight forward
2011-09-27T19:54:21  <ChrisH> McLeopold: so the score is right, but the display is inconsistent with other bot elimination situations.
2011-09-27T19:54:57  <antimatroid> i really don't think the squatting thing is that much of an issue the more i think about it?
2011-09-27T19:54:59  <ChrisH> McLeopold: and is the visualizer looking ahead in the game to know the final score for that player?
2011-09-27T19:55:22  <CIA-24> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * rc21894b / (2 files in 2 dirs): fix for python starter bot - http://git.io/aWx7Sg
2011-09-27T19:55:22  <CIA-24> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r1302cd3 / ants/visualizer/js/CanvasElement.js : Merge branch 'epsilon' of github.com:aichallenge/aichallenge into epsilon - http://git.io/MQPuKg
2011-09-27T19:55:25  <antimatroid> you want to take out as many ant hills as fast as possible, because as the game progresses any remaining hills are going to be better guarded and more spread out, making it more costly to gain points
2011-09-27T19:55:29  <McLeopold> ChrisH: yes, kind of
2011-09-27T19:55:58  <amstan> McLeopold: all good? https://gist.github.com/062e1cb6bfea05011903
2011-09-27T19:55:59  <antimatroid> and you aren't going to be sure how many ant hills your opponent has etc. personally I wouldn't worry about taking out a few ants and just get rid of their hill already, and if someone is taking out your ants then it's on you to send reinforcements to stop them
2011-09-27T19:56:45  <McLeopold> amstan: reference the python starter
2011-09-27T19:56:51  <amstan> McLeopold: ok
2011-09-27T19:56:59  <ChrisH> antimatroid: I agree with you in general, but each bot knows how many hills it started with and it is trivial to assume all players get the same number of hills.
2011-09-27T19:57:17  <antimatroid> yes, but depending on how long hte game has been going for you don't know how many they've lost
2011-09-27T19:57:22  <CIA-24> aichallenge: Alexandru Stan epsilon * rd912799 / (5 files):
2011-09-27T19:57:22  <CIA-24> aichallenge: Merge pull request #268 from smiley1983/epsilon
2011-09-27T19:57:22  <CIA-24> aichallenge: OCaml starter: added hill support - http://git.io/WBROQg
2011-09-27T19:57:28  <McLeopold> plus mention that ants and hills can co-exists, so a simple matrix is not sufficient, coffescript needs to change that
2011-09-27T19:57:59  <antimatroid> yeah i had to think about that when i fixed my debug state output function, i have hills priority and capitalised them
2011-09-27T19:58:36  <McLeopold> antimatroid: did you follow our new map format?
2011-09-27T19:58:47  <antimatroid> what's the new map format?
2011-09-27T19:58:50  <ChrisH> antimatroid: true, it would be difficult to know because a hill could be razed before you ever scout it's location and you would never get the info from the server, but once you've scouted 100% of the map you could infer it's absence.
2011-09-27T19:58:58  <McLeopold> 0=hill, a=ant, A=ant on hill
2011-09-27T19:59:30  <antimatroid> i'll update my map generator lator
2011-09-27T19:59:38  <antimatroid> or is that to stay the same?
2011-09-27T19:59:41  <antimatroid> i'm off to uni soonish
2011-09-27T19:59:54  <McLeopold> the map generator should output numbers now
2011-09-27T20:00:09  <McLeopold> we want the other stuff so we can paste inprogress games as maps
2011-09-27T20:00:37  <antimatroid> yeah cool, i had a moment of displeasure when I realised I wouldn't have been able to do that anymore yesterday :)
2011-09-27T20:00:48  <amstan> oh man, cool!
2011-09-27T20:00:50  <amstan> git.io
2011-09-27T20:00:55  <antimatroid> my bot is set up so I can just geed state information to it through a file and check the output :)
2011-09-27T20:01:00  <antimatroid> feed*
2011-09-27T20:01:50  <mleise> antimatroid: in other words you have a stateless bot :)

2011-09-27T20:02:15  <antimatroid> depends, i don't clear everything each turn, but i'd need to provide all relevant water etc. info :P
2011-09-27T20:02:41  <antimatroid> it'd have a go at playing stateless, put it that way :)
2011-09-27T20:02:55  <McLeopold> mleise: depending on the shape of the visualizer, sometimes it looks like bots have double the starting hills
2011-09-27T20:03:49  <mleise> McLeopold: I know, and I would have rendered the circles only in the center if that was a quick change.
2011-09-27T20:05:41  <ChrisH> the new hill cues and proximity circles make games with lots of hills a lot more watchable.  Kudos to all involved
2011-09-27T20:06:33  <McLeopold> mleise: could you maybe put the hill circle on only when you know it will be captured?
2011-09-27T20:06:46  <McLeopold> say, 20 turns before or something?
2011-09-27T20:06:57  <McLeopold> I like the ping and the start
2011-09-27T20:07:46  <McLeopold> I guess that would mess up the live games...
2011-09-27T20:09:47  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-09-27T20:10:12  <mleise> McLeopold: Live games are a niche product. They could live without it.
2011-09-27T20:10:40  <mleise> I just like the hints it gives on defense situations
2011-09-27T20:10:53  <mleise> even if the hill is not razed
2011-09-27T20:12:26  <ChrisH> mleise: I don't know if there are a better choice of colors, but the green and the orange are really tough for red-green color blind people like me.
2011-09-27T20:13:30  <mleise> ChrisH: I see... almost no difference in brightness
2011-09-27T20:13:54  <McLeopold> mleise: do you still have the pallette tool?
2011-09-27T20:14:00  <ChrisH> mleise: yeah, the orange is the one I would prefer to eliminate
2011-09-27T20:14:03  <McLeopold> we can limit it to 10 colors
2011-09-27T20:14:43  <McLeopold> plus blue and brown
2011-09-27T20:14:48  <McLeopold> 12 colors
2011-09-27T20:14:54  <McLeopold> and the food
2011-09-27T20:15:01  <mleise> McLeopold: The palette tool turned out to perform badly. I should have used a 'real world' case instead of squares on water/sand/food backgrounds
2011-09-27T20:15:54  <mleise> ChrisH: maybe you can come up with a colorized screenshot for a 10 player game? that would be helpful for me
2011-09-27T20:16:42  <ChrisH> i could try, any suggestions how to go about it?
2011-09-27T20:16:52  <ChrisH> I've got GIMP.
2011-09-27T20:16:52  <mleise> I heard red-green blind people are good at distinguishing shades of green and khaki.
2011-09-27T20:17:06  <mleise> GIMP is ok.
2011-09-27T20:17:17  <ChrisH> it's free ;)
2011-09-27T20:17:20  <mleise> there is a filter for switching colors i think
2011-09-27T20:17:57  <ChrisH> so just capture a 10 player game in progress and do some color replacements? and paste it somewhere?

2011-09-27T20:20:01  <ChrisH> anyone have any links to a 10 player game?
2011-09-27T20:21:16  <ChrisH> the most I've ever seen is 8.

2011-09-27T20:35:44  <ChrisH> mleise: what about changing the orange to more of a yellow, such as efd900
2011-09-27T20:35:56  <aarossig> hello all
2011-09-27T20:36:30  <mleise> ChrisH: possible, but if it becomes too bright, the timeline becomes barely visible
2011-09-27T20:36:30  <amstan_> aarossig: yo computerwiz_222
2011-09-27T20:36:55  <ChrisH> mleise: good point, let me try something
2011-09-27T20:37:05  <mleise> That's why I tried to restrict all the colors to some brightness range
2011-09-27T20:45:33  <ChrisH> mleise: it's not easy finding another hue when there are already 9 chosen.
2011-09-27T20:45:55  <mleise> ChrisH: I know ;). Guess how hard it was with 26 players
2011-09-27T20:45:57  <ChrisH> mleise: at the least, try to make it so the orange is the last color used, so it only shows up in 10 player games
2011-09-27T20:46:42  <mleise> ok I'll do that
2011-09-27T20:46:44  <ChrisH> mleise: another idea would be to decorate some of the ants with an outline, or a little dot in the middle, or some other shape.
2011-09-27T20:47:15  <mleise> I have greek letters for you
2011-09-27T20:47:53  <ChrisH> unfortunately the circles are so on the big maps that something that intricate is just lost.
2011-09-27T20:49:05  <ChrisH> there was an online game I played once that had an orange and lime green even harder for me to tell apart, even with much bigger icons. Luckily they put a texture on each piece that was randomly rotated each game.
2011-09-27T20:49:29  <ChrisH> the games where the green and orage got the same rotation angle I would just skip to the next board.
2011-09-27T20:49:41  <mleise> hehe
2011-09-27T20:50:26  <mleise> I still support old replay files with up to 26 players, so I would definitly want to draw 26 textures for the ants
2011-09-27T20:50:45  <mleise> that could end up being a lot of work

2011-09-27T20:51:21  <mleise> green could have a leaf texture, brown is wood, grey is chrystal
2011-09-27T20:51:34  <ChrisH> I just tried the greek letters. That's definitely an option for when I need it.

2011-09-27T23:05:34  <janzert> McLeopold: oh come on :P you don't think the way you asked amstan about the game end condition was just a bit the far side of biased? :/ and amstan already agreed with you about not eliminating players outright when their last hill is killed. He's the one that convinced me to go along with it. :}
2011-09-27T23:05:58  <janzert> and it really was your idea ;) 2011-09-26T01:07:49  <McLeopold> if you lose your hills, you still get to participate somewhat, but the cutoffs and other game length decisions won't depend on you
2011-09-27T23:06:22  <janzert> I still think you had a great idea there
2011-09-27T23:06:45  <McLeopold> where?
2011-09-27T23:06:51  <janzert> from a game rule perspective I also still think the most natural is that when you lose all your hills (bases) you're eliminated from the game
2011-09-27T23:06:55  <amstan> janzert: it might have been biased, but i was convinced about the answer since i talked to you
2011-09-27T23:07:16  <McLeopold> janzert: check the database for the cutoff reason
2011-09-27T23:07:24  <janzert> amstan: I'm not even sure you know what the question is ;)
2011-09-27T23:07:40  <McLeopold> I've stopped cutting off the games to see if there is any difference in rank
2011-09-27T23:07:48  <janzert> but I do agree that just having a bunch of ants freeze is less than ideal for watching games
2011-09-27T23:08:11  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah I saw that, that is good to see
2011-09-27T23:08:34  <McLeopold> so far, no different results
2011-09-27T23:08:45  <janzert> so anyway I think your "compromise" you came up with is the perfect position in between
2011-09-27T23:09:00  <janzert> to repeat it: 2011-09-26T01:07:49  <McLeopold> if you lose your hills, you still get to participate somewhat, but the cutoffs and other game length decisions won't depend on you
2011-09-27T23:09:11  <janzert> doing that is the question amstan
2011-09-27T23:09:36  <McLeopold> okay, but you did redefine "remaining players" and when I made that statement it was different
2011-09-27T23:09:57  <amstan> janzert: i'm not that familiar with the game length decisions i guess, but sure
2011-09-27T23:10:00  <janzert> ? that statement doesn't refer to remaining players
2011-09-27T23:10:17  <janzert> amstan: whether the game should continue or not
2011-09-27T23:10:37  <McLeopold> it's in the word "cutoffs" and the phrase "game length decisions"
2011-09-27T23:10:38  <amstan> janzert: let's put it this way, the scenario is too specific for people to have to explain in an argument if they don't like it
2011-09-27T23:11:33  <McLeopold> aka, you're not leading, so well let you continue to try and win, even though you are the only bot with hills
2011-09-27T23:11:33  <janzert> yes, there is one scenario that so far hasn't been seen to happen in practice that is seen as unfavorable when following that
2011-09-27T23:11:44  <McLeopold> /well/we'll/
2011-09-27T23:12:49  <janzert> I think it is a nice spot in between outright elimination and keeping you fully in the game, you have a chance but you can't make the game keep going just so you continue to have a chance
2011-09-27T23:13:49  <janzert> speaking practically it also has a nice side effect of eliminating lots of moves that don't have much chance of changing anything in the outcome
2011-09-27T23:14:58  <janzert> so far since McLeopold added the measurement code it would be the single largest reason for ending a game and not once would it have yet effected the game outcome
2011-09-27T23:15:20  <janzert> err, single largest reason except for game length limit
2011-09-27T23:15:49  <McLeopold> we've only extended 23 games
2011-09-27T23:15:51  <janzert> which is certainly effecting game outcomes but also is something that we can't do without
2011-09-27T23:16:05  <McLeopold> oh, what timestamp are you using?
2011-09-27T23:16:18  <janzert> 20:25
2011-09-27T23:16:26  <McLeopold> how long ago?
2011-09-27T23:16:59  <janzert> 7 hours?
2011-09-27T23:17:17  <McLeopold> commit log says 5 hours
2011-09-27T23:17:33  <janzert> I show 23 extended games anyway
2011-09-27T23:17:51  <janzert> current time on server is 03:17
2011-09-27T23:18:25  <janzert> I pulled the time from the time you shutdown the worker to restart it with the new code I assumed
2011-09-27T23:19:29  <janzert> if I'm too long I'm including games as not extended that should count as extended then
2011-09-27T23:21:25  <McLeopold> have you looked at the turn savings?
2011-09-27T23:22:29  <janzert> not rigorously in any way
2011-09-27T23:23:43  <janzert> some are quite small, some are quite large
2011-09-27T23:23:57  <janzert> I haven't looked at enough to get a feel  for an average or anything
2011-09-27T23:24:13  <janzert> fairly small http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=1099
2011-09-27T23:24:24  <janzert> pretty large http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=1105
2011-09-27T23:26:24  <McLeopold> janzert: 1105 looks incorrect
2011-09-27T23:27:03  <McLeopold> isn't the leader the only one with a hill?
2011-09-27T23:28:08  <McLeopold> even without that, hasn't the rank been stabalized?
2011-09-27T23:28:31  <janzert> hmm, it seems like
2011-09-27T23:28:41  <McLeopold> that's got to be a bug
2011-09-27T23:28:49  <McLeopold> it should have been cut off
2011-09-27T23:29:05  <janzert> at least after fxwz141 dies
2011-09-27T23:29:25  <janzert> so still would have been extended more than 50%
2011-09-27T23:29:42  <McLeopold> actually, right at turn 144
2011-09-27T23:30:03  <janzert> with ants that don't control a hill don't extend the game
2011-09-27T23:30:20  <janzert> ranks don't stabilize till 574
2011-09-27T23:31:02  <McLeopold> wait, at 144, eAshoka is already second, and can't make first, so it should be cutoff before that
2011-09-27T23:31:24  <janzert> ranks aren't stabilized till fxwz is killed off
2011-09-27T23:31:32  <McLeopold> no, he's third, so 144 is the correct cutoff
2011-09-27T23:31:39  <janzert> since he could destroy a hill and tie with trumpet
2011-09-27T23:31:50  *** delt0r_ <delt0r_!~bob@178-190-72-247.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2011-09-27T23:31:53  <janzert> and he is alive till 574
2011-09-27T23:32:18  <McLeopold> but after he loses the hill, we don't give him the chance, since he's not the leader
2011-09-27T23:33:52  <janzert> so only the leader of the board without a hill gets to extend the game? that seem really special casing it and unfair, not at all a natural rule
2011-09-27T23:34:09  <McLeopold> janzert: oh, I removed the hill check for extended play, oops
2011-09-27T23:34:40  <McLeopold> seems natural to me
2011-09-27T23:35:52  <McLeopold> it's not so much the leader of the board gets to extend, it's more than someone else gets a chance to win
2011-09-27T23:36:31  <McLeopold> handing over points to someone doesn't seem right
2011-09-27T23:36:55  <McLeopold> so, we are only doing it in rare circumstances when we think we know who should get the points
2011-09-27T23:37:06  <McLeopold> giving someone a win is just not right
2011-09-27T23:37:40  <McLeopold> this isn't a game of survival anymore, it's about attacking hills
2011-09-27T23:37:45  <janzert> we're not 'giving' them the win, they get to the situation by keeping there hill
2011-09-27T23:37:57  <McLeopold> I don't want to emphasize defense
2011-09-27T23:38:13  <McLeopold> the -1 is only there to break up the ranks a little, not to hand a win to a dumb bot
2011-09-27T23:39:20  <janzert> I wish we would have stuck with your own hill having the same weight as taking an opponents
2011-09-27T23:39:37  <McLeopold> how come?
2011-09-27T23:40:19  <janzert> maybe you wouldn't feel like holding onto your own hill was so different from taking an opponents :/
2011-09-27T23:41:04  <McLeopold> well, if holding on to your own hill was 10x attacking, no one would ever attack
2011-09-27T23:41:16  <McLeopold> it would be a stupid game
2011-09-27T23:41:51  <McLeopold> if it was 1to1, it's still not enough benefit to attack
2011-09-27T23:41:51  <janzert> my thought on the game is that holding on to your own hill till the end of the game is the same as taking an opponents hill

2011-09-27T23:42:06  <McLeopold> I totally disagree
2011-09-27T23:42:14  <McLeopold> a game of defense is a bad game

2011-09-27T23:42:36  <janzert> I don't think it would lead to a game stuck in defense
2011-09-27T23:42:38  <McLeopold> have you played galcon online?
2011-09-27T23:42:47  <McLeopold> it would, it really would
2011-09-27T23:42:56  <janzert> if one opponent is breaking the mold you just lost the tournament
2011-09-27T23:42:58  <McLeopold> it would be a broken game and the contest wouldn't work
2011-09-27T23:43:57  <McLeopold> I know you want shorter games.  More attacking means shorter games.
2011-09-27T23:44:16  <janzert> not extending means shorter games ;)
2011-09-27T23:44:20  <McLeopold> if we encourage defense, every games goes the full length, and the cutoff adjuster skyrockets
2011-09-27T23:44:33  <janzert> but that isn't my largest reason even

2011-09-27T23:46:14  <McLeopold> the problem with the no hill games was no one was attacking
2011-09-27T23:46:15  <janzert> but when we can shorten games by what looks like an average of maybe 20% with a change in rankings of less than 1 in 20 that does seem like quite a straight up win
2011-09-27T23:46:55  <McLeopold> but your looking at bots that haven't fully adjusted to the rules
2011-09-27T23:48:00  <janzert> yeah, once bots will at least take one step out of there way to gain a point the gain will probably be much larger ;)
2011-09-27T23:49:05  <janzert> yes, once defense actually enters the game hills are going to become actually hard to destroy
2011-09-27T23:49:22  <janzert> but that isn't going to change by this
2011-09-27T23:49:38  <McLeopold> well, it would by the points per hill
2011-09-27T23:49:43  <McLeopold> not by the cutoff
2011-09-27T23:50:27  <janzert> I don't really see how 1 or 2 points on one hill isn't going to make that much difference either
2011-09-27T23:50:35  <janzert> isn't->is
2011-09-27T23:53:04  <McLeopold> I'm going to add the hill check back in, so only when the last ant with hills isn't in the lead will the game be extended
2011-09-27T23:53:10  <McLeopold> let's see what we get then
2011-09-27T23:53:19  <janzert> ok
2011-09-27T23:53:30  <McLeopold> can you fire up a second worker for this?
2011-09-27T23:53:35  <janzert> I gotta get to bed, back to work in 7 hours
