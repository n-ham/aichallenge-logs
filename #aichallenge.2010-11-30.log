2010-11-30T00:17:38  <bss03> So, is there an announce/devel list I can join to help out next year?
2010-11-30T00:19:09  <bss03> While I can't predict my time availability next year, I definitely want to help with the starter packs, visualizers, and stuff like that.

2010-11-30T00:20:28  <antimatroid> my send everything move paid off again :)
2010-11-30T00:20:41  <antimatroid> this time on the second planet take
2010-11-30T00:21:20  <antimatroid> medrimonia: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9233021 nice graph :)

2010-11-30T00:31:45  <Frontier> and would you have had success with that in the end?
2010-11-30T00:32:20  <Frontier> Did you have more ships than medrimonia could have produced while yours are in flight?
2010-11-30T00:33:14  <smloh1> yes, he was able to successfully defend all the way
2010-11-30T00:34:12  <smloh1> how's your bot doing antimatroid?
2010-11-30T00:34:20  <Frontier> smloh1: would he have captured medrimonia's central planet was my question
2010-11-30T00:34:52  <antimatroid> frontier: medrimonia didn't have centre
2010-11-30T00:34:59  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure i would have held it indefinitely
2010-11-30T00:36:42  <smloh1> what i don't understand is the logic behind the attack, is it some kind of endgame code? if behind, attack hoping enemy will defend suboptimally?
2010-11-30T00:36:51  <Frontier> antimatroid: well, the planet closest to the center. you both have the same planets on your respective side, but it looks to me as if in turn 400 or so, you wouldn't have enough extra ships to actually defeat medrimonia.
2010-11-30T00:39:04  <antimatroid> no, but i'd probably still be ahead
2010-11-30T00:39:11  <Frontier> smloh1: If you have enough ships you can slowly decimate the enemy forces while keeping each planet secure. And with even more ships you will finally reach the point where you conquer the enemy's front planet even if growth is equal. It looks all pretty sane to me :)
2010-11-30T00:39:13  <antimatroid> expanding better and sustaining == win
2010-11-30T00:40:01  <janzert> next cutoff change will start in about 20 minutes
2010-11-30T00:40:15  <smloh1> Frontier: i guess i don't usually attack unless the enemy has no chance of defending, and in this case it looked pretty clearly defendable
2010-11-30T00:40:16  <janzert> and end at the 3020 mark at 5am server time
2010-11-30T00:40:30  <smloh1> is that for starter pack bots?
2010-11-30T00:40:39  <janzert> yes
2010-11-30T00:40:49  <antimatroid> janzert: :)
2010-11-30T00:40:55  <antimatroid> i started an arimaa bot yesterday

2010-11-30T00:41:30  <Frontier> smloh1: I don't quite understand what you mean by defendable? Is that in turn 200, if you send all ships you don't gain at least 1 ship?
2010-11-30T00:42:42  <burny> janz, only cutting off 30% for now?
2010-11-30T00:42:56  <antimatroid> Frotnier: we had the same production, he can't wear me down without wearing himself down
2010-11-30T00:42:57  <smloh1> Frontier: i mean that you are able to attack with enough ships that the opponent cannot get enough ships to the planet in time to defend
2010-11-30T00:43:01  <antimatroid> i was able to defend any attack he sent
2010-11-30T00:43:11  <janzert> burny: basically just going to just beyond the starter bots for the moment
2010-11-30T00:43:40  <Frontier> antimatroid: that is what i assumed
2010-11-30T00:43:44  <smloh1> antimatroid: actually, since you were 46 ships ahead you could theoretically have scooted all your spare ships up and taken the central planet

2010-11-30T00:44:24  <bss03> janzert: I wanted to add myself to a list of potential volunteers for prep. next year.
2010-11-30T00:44:26  <Frontier> smloh1: not without weakening your own position somewhere I guess
2010-11-30T00:44:31  <janzert> I know Jeff wants to have something for next term
2010-11-30T00:44:41  <janzert> bss03: talk to amstan next time you see him
2010-11-30T00:44:53  <bss03> @seen amstan
2010-11-30T00:44:53  <contestbot> bss03: amstan was last seen in #aichallenge 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 33 seconds ago: <amstan> but there's a high chance a will beat b
2010-11-30T00:44:57  <amstan> bss03: yo
2010-11-30T00:45:00  <janzert> he can point you in the right direction
2010-11-30T00:45:13  <amstan> bss03: umm... just watch the suggestions/behind the scenes forums
2010-11-30T00:45:22  <amstan> bss03: and hang out more in here
2010-11-30T00:46:02  <Frontier> smloh1: When I think of attacking a planet with all my force and the enemy defends with all his force, then there isn't generally only one point where I win. The planet may switch sides a few times until the fleets are all worn down.
2010-11-30T00:46:08  <bss03> amstan: I'm really not much of an IRC'er most of the time.  But, I'll use RSS to watch the behind the scenes forums.  Thanks.
2010-11-30T00:46:27  <amstan> bss03: we'll have planning in there too
2010-11-30T00:47:38  <smloh1> Frontier: but you can tell by calculating whether all your forces would be enough to take on all the forces the enemy will have there by the time your fleet arrives
2010-11-30T00:47:39  <Frontier> Hey amstan and janzert, I put up some ideas based on the old RoboCom game in the ideas forum.

2010-11-30T00:50:05  <Frontier> smloh1: I wouldn't have 'one fleet' either. I can send few ships from a close planet or many ships if I wait some turns and accumulate ships from farther away. Both strategies work differentlywork
2010-11-30T00:50:38  <antimatroid> it's not possible to re run the contest
2010-11-30T00:50:43  <antimatroid> that would cause the biggest shit storm
2010-11-30T00:50:59  <smloh1> Frontier: yes, i'm not sure we don't actually agree.  that's what i do too.
2010-11-30T00:51:07  <antimatroid> it would have to severely go wrong for that to be a feasible option
2010-11-30T00:51:17  <Frontier> bigger than yours Accoun, unless you repeat your proposal 100 times more ;)
2010-11-30T00:51:18  <janzert> there was no wrong winner and a total of 5 games that were played twice (out of over 400k)

2010-11-30T02:22:34  <smloh1> yeah it's a tough one to fix and still be aggressive enough on expansion
2010-11-30T02:22:45  <bhasker> you sent 36 ships out on turn 1
2010-11-30T02:22:51  <bhasker> when you were only 6 turns away
2010-11-30T02:22:58  <bhasker> turn 1 is easy
2010-11-30T02:23:13  <bhasker> you should never send more than distance between starting planet * 5
2010-11-30T02:23:17  <bhasker> at turn 1
2010-11-30T02:23:25  <bhasker> after that its tricky
2010-11-30T02:23:43  <bhasker> since you have to factor in growth from neutrals you will acquire/enemy will acquire etc
2010-11-30T02:24:01  <bhasker> i am sure you lose on rage bot on this map
2010-11-30T02:24:03  <smloh1> i don't have turn 1 specific code, so it's all (supposedly) taken care of by my eval function
2010-11-30T02:24:05  <bhasker> lose to*
2010-11-30T02:24:25  <bhasker> you should test against ragebot, if you lose on this map
2010-11-30T02:25:00  <smloh1> yeah, i forgot about testing against ragebot, that could have been a good basic test to run any version
2010-11-30T02:26:13  <antimatroid> bhasker: it's easy to not send that, but it's hard to do it and plan over the next few moves
2010-11-30T02:26:21  <antimatroid> cause you are limiting the number of ships you expect to have
2010-11-30T02:26:45  <antimatroid> that's the soul reason i ended up not using such a hack
2010-11-30T02:26:55  <antimatroid> it completely messed with what my valid options might be

2010-11-30T02:28:30  <antimatroid> he's going to hate that
2010-11-30T02:28:38  <bhasker> accoun has the same bug btw
2010-11-30T02:28:47  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9293578
2010-11-30T02:29:20  <bhasker> nice job
2010-11-30T02:29:45  <antimatroid> i've had wins against 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8
2010-11-30T02:30:04  <bhasker> antimatroid on turn 1 there is no reason to send out more than the distance * 5 unless there are planets closer by that you can capture for sure
2010-11-30T02:30:14  <burny> bhasker, if distance to enemy is 15, and there's a 5grow that costs 99 2steps away, it's worth taking in turn1
2010-11-30T02:30:29  <bhasker> if enemy is 15 turns away
2010-11-30T02:30:35  <antimatroid> bhasker: that is true, but doing so required limiting the ships i would expect to send in a few turns etc.
2010-11-30T02:30:39  <antimatroid> which ruins a lot of planning
2010-11-30T02:30:41  <bhasker> true
2010-11-30T02:30:45  <burny> or even if enemy is 12units away
2010-11-30T02:30:47  <bhasker> but yea without such planning
2010-11-30T02:30:53  <bhasker> you are susceptible to rage bot attacks
2010-11-30T02:30:59  <antimatroid> bhasker: my bot relies on a game tree :P
2010-11-30T02:31:03  <antimatroid> it needs correct predictions
2010-11-30T02:31:17  <bhasker> in which case you won't be susceptible to a rage bot attack
2010-11-30T02:31:24  <bhasker> because it would have factored the future growth in
2010-11-30T02:31:25  <antimatroid> my bot was always too conservative when i tried to add in rage bot defense
2010-11-30T02:31:31  <burny> my bot relies on re-enforcng the front lines.. but it doesn't re-enforce the front lines :(

2010-11-30T02:31:49  <bhasker> the problem burny is on some maps
2010-11-30T02:31:50  <antimatroid> i wont add an expansionary move if it's snipable, but then if i add a second, the first might become snipable
2010-11-30T02:31:54  <bhasker> the front line is not always a nice line
2010-11-30T02:31:59  <bhasker> and bots that rely on that
2010-11-30T02:32:00  <bhasker> flunk
2010-11-30T02:32:04  <burny> bhask: I don't reneforce ANYthing :P
2010-11-30T02:32:11  <antimatroid> i rely on the front line :P
2010-11-30T02:32:24  <antimatroid> although i leave ships planned for future moves
2010-11-30T02:32:30  <antimatroid> but don't store moves across turns
2010-11-30T02:32:31  <burny> watch nearly any of the games I've lost..
2010-11-30T02:32:35  <burny> I have a lead..
2010-11-30T02:32:42  <burny> then take a planet I can barely secure..
2010-11-30T02:32:46  <burny> and then don't secure it
2010-11-30T02:32:47  <antimatroid> dmj beat me :(
2010-11-30T02:32:51  <antimatroid> peky american
2010-11-30T02:32:53  <antimatroid> pesky*
2010-11-30T02:33:11  <bhasker> burny its a tricky problem to send correct number of ships
2010-11-30T02:33:13  <bhasker> to a neutral
2010-11-30T02:33:16  <burny> including a few games from some of the top10
2010-11-30T02:33:24  <bhasker> i make the same mistakes at times
2010-11-30T02:33:33  <bhasker> and so do some of the top bots
2010-11-30T02:33:34  <burny> would have had some easy top10 wins, if I had enoguh time to add re-enforcement code
2010-11-30T02:33:43  <bhasker> what do you mean by reinforcement?
2010-11-30T02:33:48  <burny> like..
2010-11-30T02:34:08  <burny> your home has 0 ships, so I send 80ships to attack it..
2010-11-30T02:34:18  <burny> then 3 turns later, you can re-capture it unless I send more..
2010-11-30T02:34:20  <burny> and I don't send more
2010-11-30T02:34:38  <bhasker> k
2010-11-30T02:35:15  <burny> and during that time, you're expanding, and I'm doing nothing(because I lost a lot of expansion time, by playing a move that should have been 'a win'
2010-11-30T02:35:20  <antimatroid> if i send to a neutral, i plan to send more than they possibly could
2010-11-30T02:35:29  <bhasker> not sure i understand
2010-11-30T02:35:29  <burny> same here nati
2010-11-30T02:35:33  <burny> and then.. I don't :P
2010-11-30T02:35:35  <bhasker> you sent 80 ships to capture it
2010-11-30T02:35:45  <bhasker> and you didnt send more because you saw you will lose it
2010-11-30T02:35:57  <bhasker> in that case you underestimated the # of ships
2010-11-30T02:35:59  <burny> ya, cause it can regrow 40 by the time I get there, and it's other planets can grow 23..
2010-11-30T02:36:11  <bhasker> ah so the way i fix it burny
2010-11-30T02:36:15  <burny> and then 3turns later, they grow another 25, and re-capture it
2010-11-30T02:36:16  <bhasker> is by overestimating
2010-11-30T02:36:29  <burny> overestimating isn't a 'fix'..
2010-11-30T02:36:41  <bhasker> well there are two ways you can look at it
2010-11-30T02:36:48  <bhasker> don't launch at enemy during expansion phase
2010-11-30T02:36:54  <bhasker> just expand rapidly
2010-11-30T02:37:03  <bhasker> and then you can do an exact snipe of each planet
2010-11-30T02:37:10  <bhasker> and eventually the growth loss will cost the enemy
2010-11-30T02:37:11  <antimatroid> mmm i love milo
2010-11-30T02:37:11  <burny> mathematically, and realistically, it is a highly viable move
2010-11-30T02:37:16  <burny> I do take the planet.
2010-11-30T02:37:19  <burny> and can secure it
2010-11-30T02:37:28  <burny> and end up with more growth and population than them
2010-11-30T02:37:29  <burny> etc.
2010-11-30T02:37:30  <bhasker> hmm you can't secure it if you lost it after 3 turns?
2010-11-30T02:37:37  <burny> I CAN secure it..
2010-11-30T02:37:42  <burny> but I don't
2010-11-30T02:37:56  <bhasker> hmm how can you secure it by continuing to send your ships?
2010-11-30T02:37:59  <bhasker> from your home planet
2010-11-30T02:38:04  <bhasker> 5 at a time?
2010-11-30T02:38:17  <burny> I had more then 80..
2010-11-30T02:38:25  <burny> maybe 76 was needed..
2010-11-30T02:38:29  <bhasker> but you sent 80 at my home planet?
2010-11-30T02:38:31  <burny> plus an extra 3 per turn..
2010-11-30T02:38:36  <burny> and I send 80, plus 0 per turn
2010-11-30T02:38:52  <bhasker> but that assumes he has at least 8 growth nearby?
2010-11-30T02:38:57  <bhasker> to your 5?
2010-11-30T02:39:35  <burny> leme find an example game
2010-11-30T02:39:44  <bhasker> so burny the other way to solve this is to do funnelling/staging
2010-11-30T02:40:00  <bhasker> basically my ships flow to planets nearest to enemy
2010-11-30T02:40:06  <burny> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9264378
2010-11-30T02:40:06  <bhasker> so if i see i am going to capture an enemy planet
2010-11-30T02:40:10  <bhasker> then my ships flow to it
2010-11-30T02:40:14  <bhasker> before it turns to me
2010-11-30T02:40:15  <burny> about 20% in, I attack at the top
2010-11-30T02:40:15  <bhasker> and not after
2010-11-30T02:40:48  <antimatroid> bhasker: are you at the same workplace as a1k0n? or just both at yahoo
2010-11-30T02:40:57  <bhasker> same place same team practically

2010-11-30T02:41:45  <bhasker> 20% in can you give ma specific turn number
2010-11-30T02:41:46  <burny> if the top was re-enforced: that would have been a win
2010-11-30T02:42:00  <bhasker> turn 34?
2010-11-30T02:42:08  <burny> about that, ya
2010-11-30T02:42:22  <bhasker> but you sent like 30 ships at a planet with 90?
2010-11-30T02:42:40  <burny> and again much later at the bottom
2010-11-30T02:42:41  <bhasker> in fact
2010-11-30T02:42:48  <bhasker> at turn 33
2010-11-30T02:42:58  <bhasker> you send 28 ships
2010-11-30T02:43:06  <bhasker> when the planet has 39
2010-11-30T02:43:07  <bhasker> on them
2010-11-30T02:43:10  <bhasker> that just seems wrong
2010-11-30T02:43:18  <burny> I sent 90?

2010-11-30T02:43:30  <antimatroid> i don't think he will though
2010-11-30T02:44:03  <bhasker> k your problem is you are waiting till the planet converts before staging to the planet
2010-11-30T02:44:08  <bhasker> which is not required
2010-11-30T02:44:11  <burny> no..
2010-11-30T02:44:13  <burny> I don't EVER stage
2010-11-30T02:44:26  <antimatroid> did anyone else redirect ships?
2010-11-30T02:44:40  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-30T02:44:50  <bhasker> so what is causing the routing
2010-11-30T02:45:01  <antimatroid> if i planed to send ships addded at time zero which could be redirected closer to the enemy and finish to their destination in time, i redirected them
2010-11-30T02:45:06  <bhasker> something is forwarding the ships right?
2010-11-30T02:45:12  <burny> it wants to attack the enemy, but doesn't have enough strength,
2010-11-30T02:45:24  *** bss03 is now known as bss03-AFK
2010-11-30T02:45:29  <burny> and so it check's for available planets on the route to it's desired target
2010-11-30T02:45:42  <smloh1> antimatroid: i tried doing that, but it didn't necessarily perform better
2010-11-30T02:45:47  <bhasker> ah you are routing always through your planets?
2010-11-30T02:45:56  <antimatroid> smloh1: it seemed to work better than not for me
2010-11-30T02:45:56  <burny> where the fail comes in, is when it's next target, is not the enemy
2010-11-30T02:46:05  <burny> so it's holding the ships there, waiting to attack a neutral
2010-11-30T02:46:18  <bhasker> why not treat enemies/neutrals the same
2010-11-30T02:46:24  <burny> it does
2010-11-30T02:46:28  <antimatroid> bhasker: cause they are not the same
2010-11-30T02:46:29  <burny> it attacked the enemy..
2010-11-30T02:46:37  <bhasker> for staging they are
2010-11-30T02:46:39  <burny> and knows it's securable, and it's going to capture, etc. etc.
2010-11-30T02:46:43  <antimatroid> if you take an enemy for a turn, that's good, if you take a neutral for a turn, that's bad
2010-11-30T02:46:45  <smloh1> antimatroid: i think it kept more ships on the move and not available for me
2010-11-30T02:46:52  <burny> but I didn't have enough time to add code to properly re-enforce stuff

2010-11-30T02:48:15  <burny> it doesn't try to re-enforce

2010-11-30T02:48:31  <bhasker> you are not moving ships to the front
2010-11-30T02:48:34  <bhasker> fast enough
2010-11-30T02:48:39  <bhasker> you have ships sitting around at the back
2010-11-30T02:48:42  <bhasker> doing nothing

2010-11-30T02:49:53  <burny> you probably have, and just don't realize?

2010-11-30T02:52:44  <bhasker> its okay burny there is always next year
2010-11-30T02:52:56  <bhasker> see my bot fail here

2010-11-30T02:53:03  <bhasker> stupid shit tried to take the middle planet
2010-11-30T02:53:08  <bhasker> and killed itself
2010-11-30T02:53:22  <burny> with how many games I lost, because of the same 2 missing features..
2010-11-30T02:53:36  <burny> I think I would have been top10
2010-11-30T02:53:49  <bhasker> burny don't be so sure lots of bots have those two features
2010-11-30T02:53:53  <bhasker> and don't make it to top 10
2010-11-30T02:53:54  <burny> even teh game I had with bosci, I would have won if not for that
2010-11-30T02:54:22  <smloh1> what are the 2 features burny?
2010-11-30T02:54:54  <bhasker> damn my first turn is horrible
2010-11-30T02:54:57  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9298325
2010-11-30T02:54:58  <burny> re-enforcing the front lines, and making an attack that leaves the source planet vulnerable to counter attacks(basically the same thing)
2010-11-30T02:55:27  <smloh1> yes those are important
2010-11-30T02:55:35  <burny> the other thing I would have liked to do, was have counter-attack logic.. so if I'm losing a planet, to attack back, instead of just taking it in the face
2010-11-30T02:55:39  <smloh1> but they're not trivial to implement
2010-11-30T02:55:39  <bhasker> i am still debating about #2
2010-11-30T02:55:49  <bhasker> my current bot has no such consideration
2010-11-30T02:56:06  <burny> smloh: trivial no.. but I could have for sure done it in a day
2010-11-30T02:56:07  <bhasker> it considers anything over minimum required to handle attacks alread in progress to be available
2010-11-30T02:56:22  <bhasker> and it actually does reasonably well
2010-11-30T02:56:31  <bhasker> despite losing planets after launching attacks
2010-11-30T02:56:32  <burny> ya, same here
2010-11-30T02:56:38  <antimatroid> my bot is completely broken tree wise, it's amazing it's doing well at all
2010-11-30T02:56:58  <smloh1> i spent a lot of time trying to find an optimal reinforcement algo which would adequately protect/supply multiple frontlines and accumulate ships for potential attacks on enemy/neutrals
2010-11-30T02:57:05  <burny> if I could add JUST re-enforcing the front lines.. I'm sure I'd be nearly top10
2010-11-30T02:57:20  <smloh1> sometimes neutrals are behind the front line and leaving enough ships at the back to capture one tilts the balance
2010-11-30T02:57:33  <antimatroid> burny: just storm everyone next comp :)
2010-11-30T02:57:49  <antimatroid> there's going to be even more slaves from the start next time
2010-11-30T02:58:13  <bhasker> smloh1: there are too many RPS models
2010-11-30T02:58:29  <bhasker> if you have a strong central and you don't reinforce to it and enemy reinforces to his central you can lose it
2010-11-30T02:58:42  <bhasker> on some maps holding back can win the map
2010-11-30T02:58:48  <bhasker> when enemy funnels to center
2010-11-30T02:58:50  <antimatroid> on others it can lose it
2010-11-30T02:58:51  <smloh1> bhasker: true, it's tough
2010-11-30T02:58:57  <antimatroid> i like my hack
2010-11-30T02:59:04  <antimatroid> just send up to 4* planets growth
2010-11-30T02:59:10  <antimatroid> and only redistribute after turn 4
2010-11-30T02:59:18  <bhasker> i tried to fix this with doing like planet density counts
2010-11-30T02:59:28  <bhasker> and deciding to hold back if there are lot of good neutrals nearby
2010-11-30T02:59:37  <bhasker> but it never worked very well:-\
2010-11-30T02:59:43  <burny> here's another..
2010-11-30T02:59:44  <burny> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9284924
2010-11-30T02:59:59  <burny> about 20% into it again
2010-11-30T03:00:45  <burny> as much as taking the 36neutral wasn't very clever.. if the home base was re-enforcing: it would have been fine
2010-11-30T03:01:11  <burny> but instead, home sends to teh top, preparing to attack the opponents top planet next
2010-11-30T03:01:38  <burny> and then after that.. just lets it's ships sit there, roting, waiting to die
2010-11-30T03:02:24  <bhasker> so burny another thing i do
2010-11-30T03:02:46  <bhasker> is i funnel to the planet at (avgdistfrommy+avgdistfromenemy)/2
2010-11-30T03:02:54  <bhasker> the one closest to that
2010-11-30T03:02:59  <bhasker> so its usually a central planet
2010-11-30T03:03:18  <bhasker> and well i include neutrals under acquisition into the my/enemy planet list
2010-11-30T03:03:28  <bhasker> so that i take into account where enemy will be in the future
2010-11-30T03:03:31  <bhasker> when funnelling
2010-11-30T03:03:36  <bhasker> so that i don't end up funnelling to the top
2010-11-30T03:03:41  <bhasker> when enemy is capturing stuff at the bottom
2010-11-30T03:03:45  <burny> ya, I do the future stuff too
2010-11-30T03:04:01  <burny> just missing, re-enforcing front lines

2010-11-30T03:04:42  <burny> of all the losses I watched of mine: they're all either, attacking leaving the source undefended, or failing to re-enforce
2010-11-30T03:04:47  <bhasker> yup that is critical since holding ships back once neutrals are taken is pointless
2010-11-30T03:04:57  <bhasker> you can always protect your back line from your front line
2010-11-30T03:05:18  <bhasker> they have a shorter distance to travel than the enemy at any time
2010-11-30T03:05:31  <burny> uh huh
2010-11-30T03:05:33  <bhasker> like this http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9300115
2010-11-30T03:05:43  <bhasker> my central planet can protect any of my planets
2010-11-30T03:05:45  <bhasker> from attacks
2010-11-30T03:05:52  <smloh1> what's your analysis of this one? ;) http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9150531
2010-11-30T03:06:15  <bhasker> mine?
2010-11-30T03:06:28  <smloh1> no, burny
2010-11-30T03:07:47  <bhasker> also another thing, there is very little advantage in launching attacks from back planets
2010-11-30T03:07:56  <bhasker> so you might as well send everything to the front
2010-11-30T03:08:31  <burny> it should have re-enforced the top planet

2010-11-30T03:09:06  <smloh1> i think it was more the decision to attack the lower planet, which left insufficient ships to reinforce/defend the top planet
2010-11-30T03:09:55  * antimatroid has moved onto thinking about arimaa :)
2010-11-30T03:10:50  <burny> sending 71 was ok.. I had enough to defend against the 36 +5 per turn
2010-11-30T03:10:51  <bhasker> so when is the arimaa competition
2010-11-30T03:10:58  <burny> but I didn't send them there
2010-11-30T03:11:01  <burny> I let them rot
2010-11-30T03:11:28  <Accoun> Pairing cutoff number changed?
2010-11-30T03:11:35  <Accoun> it lower
2010-11-30T03:11:42  <burny> but yes: it did not take into account how much needed to be kept behind for defense
2010-11-30T03:12:30  <smloh1> no i think it became undefendable once the top planet flipped then it became a defense against 37 +8 per turn
2010-11-30T03:12:43  <burny> it wouldn't have flipped
2010-11-30T03:13:08  <smloh1> no, i mean my top planet
2010-11-30T03:13:45  <burny> I had 9on teh top we each had 3grow

2010-11-30T03:14:38  <bhasker> 55*

2010-11-30T03:15:12  <smloh1> bhasker: no, be optimistic!  i need you to climb up so the loss against you doesn't count as much against my elo! :P
2010-11-30T03:15:20  <bhasker> lol
2010-11-30T03:15:42  <bhasker> looking at the bots above me
2010-11-30T03:15:49  <bhasker> i know i can't beat most of the consistently on tcp server
2010-11-30T03:16:01  <bhasker> dabino i am probably 50-50 with
2010-11-30T03:16:08  <bhasker> leopold stomps my bot
2010-11-30T03:16:19  <bhasker> oldman is like 35-65
2010-11-30T03:16:34  <smloh1> yes, in fact i'm surprised how far down many familiar names from before are
2010-11-30T03:17:07  <bhasker> so nope don't have hopes of climbing much further
2010-11-30T03:17:12  <bhasker> unless my bot becomes sentient
2010-11-30T03:17:16  <bhasker> and starts thinking for itself
2010-11-30T03:17:40  <smloh1> when on wednesday does it end?
2010-11-30T03:17:53  <bhasker> no idea
2010-11-30T03:18:10  <smloh1> well it's at least another 24 full hours of processing, a lot can happen
2010-11-30T03:18:22  <smloh1> so, good luck!
2010-11-30T03:18:37  <bhasker> hehe thanks lets see
2010-11-30T03:18:47  <bhasker> me rebel have very similar bots
2010-11-30T03:18:51  <bhasker> and our elo's reflect that
2010-11-30T03:18:57  <bhasker> we are like 2-3 ranks from each other
2010-11-30T03:19:04  <bhasker> 1 rank now
2010-11-30T03:19:10  <bhasker> 3481 vs 3477
2010-11-30T03:19:12  <smloh1> are they similar in logic?
2010-11-30T03:19:37  <bhasker> i think so , rebel ran some tests of my bot vs his
2010-11-30T03:19:44  <bhasker> on the full 150 map set i think we are almost even
2010-11-30T03:19:56  <bhasker> on the first 75 his bot dominates
2010-11-30T03:20:00  <bhasker> on the second set mine dominates
2010-11-30T03:20:32  <smloh1> ah
2010-11-30T03:20:47  <smloh1> i wish there were some way to remove map selection bias
2010-11-30T03:20:50  <smloh1> but it's impossible

2010-11-30T04:22:33  <antimatroid> although i think the run the bot over each turn, which means i can't just keep a tree in memory and update it every move

2010-11-30T04:23:28  <antimatroid> i can probably do that, but it'd be faster if it was already in memory

2010-11-30T04:49:56  <Frontier> I have a funny idea for a contest. The whole game would run in a virtual machine and you can construct and extend factories on the planets. The ships, planets and factories all have their own execution thread. To capture another planet you would have to construct a ship with 'transport' room, move your planet's population into the ship and unload it at its destination. The more population you have on one planet the faster y

2010-11-30T05:04:34  <Frontier> sigh: I'm not so sure myself yet. But I guess if the planet has +5, that affects the population like it does the ships in PlanetWars. The population in turn would be related to the 'growth' of a factory on this planet.
2010-11-30T05:05:19  <smloh1> might be as a result of good bots with bad start moving back up the ranks, the top bots are facing tougher opponents in the "neighbourhood" and getting more losses
2010-11-30T05:05:21  <Frontier> So with 10 population the factory can produce like 1 ship more each turn, with 20 population it is 2 ships more each turn and so on.

2010-11-30T05:06:57  <Frontier> sigh: Ships could have different sizes though. Maybe even carriers would be possible ^^. At least fighters and transport ships would be nice.

2010-11-30T05:26:09  <Frontier> Would that give particular bots time to play out their strengths?
2010-11-30T05:26:25  <antimatroid> you could also have them starting with more than one home planet
2010-11-30T05:26:28  <antimatroid> all over the map
2010-11-30T05:26:44  <antimatroid> we can run maps like that on mcleopolds server if enough people are keen
2010-11-30T05:27:01  <Frontier> That would be feasible

2010-11-30T05:27:54  <antimatroid> my generator is awesome
2010-11-30T05:27:59  <antimatroid> it's a small cock
2010-11-30T05:28:19  <antimatroid> or are they just really big balls? :P
2010-11-30T05:28:23  <sigh> I think you need to go to a doctor

2010-11-30T05:28:50  <Epona> has anyone released their code yet?
2010-11-30T05:28:57  <antimatroid> Epona: plenty of people
2010-11-30T05:28:59  <antimatroid> it's in the forums
2010-11-30T05:29:06  <Epona> going to the forums*

2010-11-30T05:29:23  <antimatroid> you'll need to wait a few days for bocsimackos code, but it'll be out then

2010-11-30T05:30:00  <medrimonia> Woot! Won against Astek!

2010-11-30T05:30:48  <antimatroid> inside make children, there's stuff inside the for loop for player 1 that should be fixed and outside the for loop
2010-11-30T05:30:55  <antimatroid> and it shoudl also then be deleting unused made children
2010-11-30T05:31:03  <sigh> haha, why is it in amstan's github?
2010-11-30T05:31:25  <antimatroid> cause i have nfi how to use it :P
2010-11-30T05:32:18  <sigh> aw, it's not that hard... even I figured out how to use it :P
2010-11-30T05:32:20  <antimatroid> and lots of comments are outdated :P i couldn't be bothered cleaning before uploading
2010-11-30T05:32:34  <antimatroid> i've never actually tried, i will at some point
2010-11-30T05:32:56  <sigh> yeah, that's the main reason I haven't released my code yet... that and the fact that my bot sucks
2010-11-30T05:33:11  <antimatroid> most of my stuff is in gamestate.cc if anyone is actually looking at my code

2010-11-30T05:56:35  <antimatroid> hmmm, i have an idea for how you might better approximate real time planet wars
2010-11-30T05:56:57  <antimatroid> just make the turn time tiny, and have people maintain information across turns
2010-11-30T05:57:09  <antimatroid> and much larger distances
2010-11-30T05:57:37  <antimatroid> you could do distances in units of 4 each, to minimise used memory
2010-11-30T05:58:24  <Accoun> baned on forum
2010-11-30T05:58:40  <antimatroid> you need to look up the definition of banned
2010-11-30T05:58:43  <Accoun> unlacky map set
2010-11-30T05:59:03  <Accoun> hate all canadian
2010-11-30T05:59:05  <rabidus_> unlacky?

2010-11-30T06:00:06  <antimatroid> current map set unlucky for me"
2010-11-30T06:00:23  <rabidus_> lol :D
2010-11-30T06:00:28  <Accoun> why janzert add the new maps set after I won 2nd place?
2010-11-30T06:01:07  <Accoun> why?
2010-11-30T06:01:45  <medrimonia> Hmm Accoun, I heard you saying that they must add map because it'll be more fair.
2010-11-30T06:02:25  <medrimonia> Now, they have added 75 maps and you're complaining... it doesn't seem right to me.
2010-11-30T06:02:46  <rabidus_> there are now 150 maps?
2010-11-30T06:02:48  <Accoun> medrimonia> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=1188&p=7958#p7958
2010-11-30T06:02:49  <sigh> clearly the maps were chosen specifically to disadvantage Accoun
2010-11-30T06:02:55  <medrimonia> Except if the only thing that matters for you is that you win...
2010-11-30T06:03:02  <Accoun> yes
2010-11-30T06:03:06  <rabidus_> sigh: true!
2010-11-30T06:03:17  <rabidus_> that's so obvious!
2010-11-30T06:03:24  <antimatroid> there is no other reasonable answer
2010-11-30T06:03:38  <medrimonia> Yes it's a conspiracy Accoun!
2010-11-30T06:03:58  <rabidus_> yep
2010-11-30T06:04:14  <Accoun> last year he do it
2010-11-30T06:04:19  <antimatroid> i'm not sure we're helping :)
2010-11-30T06:04:32  <medrimonia> No but that's so... incredible
2010-11-30T06:05:12  <Accoun> what is incredible?
2010-11-30T06:05:24  <antimatroid> it's a threat that you wouldn't follow through on optimally
2010-11-30T06:05:24  <medrimonia> You, I've never seen someone likes you
2010-11-30T06:05:34  <antimatroid> technically*
2010-11-30T06:05:38  <sigh> bocsimacko's bot is pretty incredible
2010-11-30T06:06:09  <medrimonia> =) win against asavis
2010-11-30T06:06:15  <Accoun> likes tom me not my target
2010-11-30T06:06:18  <Accoun> likes to me not my target
2010-11-30T06:06:39  <Accoun> im be stabile 2-3 on TCP
2010-11-30T06:07:03  <Accoun> near _iouri_
2010-11-30T06:07:40  <medrimonia> Accoun... in TCP, not everyone was playing at the same time , not everyone was playing even and some people had a lot of timeouts due to connections  issues
2010-11-30T06:07:43  <antimatroid> are astek, slin, jimrogerz and green tea on there?
2010-11-30T06:08:21  <Accoun> _iouri_ george bocsimacko is played
2010-11-30T06:08:34  <Accoun> _Astek_ if it as* bots
2010-11-30T06:08:50  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure as* bots are asavis
2010-11-30T06:09:16  <Accoun> anywey to lower on TCP than me
2010-11-30T06:09:21  <Accoun> anywey it lower on TCP than me
2010-11-30T06:09:25  <antimatroid> you just showed nothing
2010-11-30T06:09:37  <medrimonia> Accoun, if you loose you loose, if you had never lost a game on TCP, there it would be strange
2010-11-30T06:09:47  <medrimonia> But your bot is not unbeatable at all
2010-11-30T06:09:58  <antimatroid> no, i have a decent record against it on tcp
2010-11-30T06:10:02  <Accoun> no any bot unbeatable at all
2010-11-30T06:10:15  <antimatroid> bocsis is a clear winner
2010-11-30T06:10:16  <medrimonia> No but bocsimacko is clearly the best bot
2010-11-30T06:10:17  <antimatroid> always has been
2010-11-30T06:10:21  <medrimonia> You're not
2010-11-30T06:10:24  <medrimonia> That's all
2010-11-30T06:10:33  <Accoun> im 2nd !

2010-11-30T06:20:27  <sigh> antimatroid: best just to ignore him?
2010-11-30T06:20:50  <antimatroid> if one can actually ignore people on irc, he's not seeing a thing i say :P
2010-11-30T06:20:57  <antimatroid> i just respond anyway
2010-11-30T06:21:09  <medrimonia> I'm hesitating, because sometimes it's hilarious to see what he writes

2010-11-30T06:53:07  <antimatroid> my room is rather messy
2010-11-30T06:53:09  <antimatroid> i should do that
2010-11-30T06:53:27  <Error323> my room is enormously messy
2010-11-30T06:54:02  <sigh> my room is exactly as messy as it needs to be

2010-11-30T07:52:29  <GreenTea> "Wednesday Dec 1, 2010: official results and final rankings will be released. " in what time, who knows?
2010-11-30T07:52:58  <Error323> good question
2010-11-30T07:53:31  <Epona> stick around here and the forums
2010-11-30T07:53:55  <janzert1> Jeff and I are supposed to talk today to set a specific time he wants to do it
2010-11-30T07:54:39  <Epona> ill be here for a little while making sure its spread to everyone. theres probably other people doing it as well
2010-11-30T07:58:25  <antimatroid> janzert1: could i ask you a couple of questions on how to interact with arimaa engine?
2010-11-30T07:58:43  <antimatroid> i find it hard to find information and read other peoples bots :P, they arne't hard
2010-11-30T07:59:00  <janzert1> I may or may not be not be around for long but go ahead
2010-11-30T07:59:53  <antimatroid> 1. my bot gets run from scratch for each turn unlike this yes? can i write to files at least?|
2010-11-30T07:59:54  <antimatroid> 2. what is the string inputed to my engine? is it their turn as specified, or do i get my turn and comments etc. passed to me as well at different points?
2010-11-30T08:00:20  <janzert1> antimatroid: with the default interface it is restarted every turn yes, but...
2010-11-30T08:00:56  <janzert1> you probably want to use AEI instead of the default http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/
2010-11-30T08:01:09  <antimatroid> yeah i've got that :)
2010-11-30T08:01:26  <janzert1> ahh, ok. under AEI your bot stays running for the whole game
2010-11-30T08:01:29  <antimatroid> i'm just trying to set my c++ files up and working out how to handle input
2010-11-30T08:01:42  <antimatroid> so i can store and update my tree between turns? cool
2010-11-30T08:01:46  <antimatroid> that makes things easier

2010-11-30T08:02:32  <antimatroid> would i only ever see their lines of that coming from input?
2010-11-30T08:02:38  <antimatroid> or do they send my moves back to me?
2010-11-30T08:02:50  <antimatroid> they == the engine :)
2010-11-30T08:03:22  <janzert1> no, the protocol description at http://arimaa.janzert.com/aei/aei-protocol.html or in the interface download as aei-protocol.txt(?) and then also the very simple engine in the download are probably the best starting spots
2010-11-30T08:03:45  <antimatroid> i hadn't found that page, thanks, i'll read :)
2010-11-30T08:04:06  <janzert1> basically each line of input is a command from the controller
2010-11-30T08:04:32  <janzert1> of the form "command <optional arguments depending on command>
2010-11-30T08:05:31  <janzert1> the protocol is fairly similar in form to the UCI protocol for chess engines if you are familiar with that

2010-11-30T08:10:24  <Accoun> mega1> not
2010-11-30T08:10:41  <Accoun> mega1> i can run 16 copies on my dual core
2010-11-30T08:10:55  <mega1> antimatroid: only in the opening phase
2010-11-30T08:11:41  <Error323> for the naish equilibrium?
2010-11-30T08:12:15  <mega1> no, for 4 ply alpha beta
2010-11-30T08:12:20  <antimatroid> i didn't think of this till too late, i wonder if you tried it? make the game tree with each player making one move per node, but only actually add each of player ones children where the payoff for that turn is greater than doing nothing (with them responding to nothing)
2010-11-30T08:12:22  <Error323> oh i see
2010-11-30T08:12:32  <antimatroid> that probably would have got me a few more moves out each turn
2010-11-30T08:13:06  <antimatroid> greater than or equal*
2010-11-30T08:13:12  <mega1> I tried and it suck for some reason. didn't have the time to investigate.
2010-11-30T08:13:24  <antimatroid> yep fair enough
2010-11-30T08:14:10  <antimatroid> that's the best idea i have for a minimax tree with this, i really don't trust alpha beta pruning while still extending
2010-11-30T08:14:30  <Error323> not trust?
2010-11-30T08:14:37  <antimatroid> i should come up with an example to show my reasoning and see if i can show what i mean
2010-11-30T08:14:39  <antimatroid> i'll do that now

2010-11-30T08:23:00  <antimatroid> you made a move, to which they consider attacking, but you could then own their source planets of that attack if you made another move, but if you use alpha beta before extending, you might cut that branch out before extending to see that you would have come good again

2010-11-30T08:23:42  <antimatroid> one could argue that's a fault of the evaluation function/move selection
2010-11-30T08:23:50  <antimatroid> but wherever you want to place the problem, there's an issue there

2010-11-30T08:24:32  <antimatroid> does that make sense at all?
2010-11-30T08:25:12  <antimatroid> you could make an example with 3 planets and a triangle
2010-11-30T08:25:30  <antimatroid> you could take a neutral closer to you that's snipable, but not without you then sniping their home planet
2010-11-30T08:25:41  <antimatroid> which is easy to account for with just one source, but what about when you have more?
2010-11-30T08:28:03  <antimatroid> Error323: you're not allowed to make me explain and not respond :P
2010-11-30T08:28:07  <antimatroid> throw me a bone here :)
2010-11-30T08:29:19  <Error323> lol, i'm thinking. I don't really understand your example, but alphabeta will provably always perform the same as minimax
2010-11-30T08:29:54  <antimatroid> it would if you use it while evaluating the entire tree you plan to use
2010-11-30T08:30:00  <antimatroid> but i don't trust it when cropping a tree i still plan to extend, not unless the payoff is certain
2010-11-30T08:30:17  <antimatroid> you could do some pruning with that information and get exactly the same results (if not better) than minimax guaranteed
2010-11-30T08:30:32  <antimatroid> mega1: ^^ am i just an idiot?
2010-11-30T08:31:20  <janzert1> yes, extensions and reductions/pruning will break the alpha-beta minimax equivalency
2010-11-30T08:31:46  <janzert1> but are still very frequently better in practice because of the extra depth that can be obtained
2010-11-30T08:31:56  <antimatroid> yeah, i had been thinking that lately :)
2010-11-30T08:32:12  <antimatroid> hence my last idea that didn't get implemented properly
2010-11-30T08:32:31  <antimatroid> i figured it's also so messy with this it's probably better to consider more moves
2010-11-30T08:32:44  <antimatroid> especialyl as the depth converted to number of moves i made per turn here
2010-11-30T08:32:50  <mega1> my move selection is heavy (basically a 1 ply search), but it's still not good enough to make alpha-beta work reliably
2010-11-30T08:34:15  <antimatroid> my move selection is probably the most expensive item, second is calculating usable ships at a planet, as each time it needs updating i have to do two whole sweeps of that planets future states, no matter when it was changed
2010-11-30T08:35:55  <Error323> I should've kept pursuing my alphabeta branch :P
2010-11-30T08:36:12  <Error323> and change my action generation
2010-11-30T08:37:56  <antimatroid> hmmm, i just hope i do a little better with the next game
2010-11-30T08:37:59  <antimatroid> this one stumped me
2010-11-30T08:38:30  <Error323> yeah me too, I have to delve into the domain more
2010-11-30T08:38:41  <Error323> which i didn't this time
2010-11-30T08:38:58  <antimatroid> i know some basic game theory
2010-11-30T08:39:05  <antimatroid> it's very mathsy after a little bit though
2010-11-30T08:39:17  <antimatroid> i haven't done enough analysis or algebra to understand most of it

2010-11-30T08:40:19  <antimatroid> i am astounded at how much that man did
2010-11-30T08:40:24  <antimatroid> and he died fairly young
2010-11-30T08:40:41  <Error323> he and turing
2010-11-30T08:40:46  <Error323> turing is a really sad story

2010-11-30T08:41:03  <Error323> got banned and castrated for being gay -.-
2010-11-30T08:41:23  <antimatroid> although the actual castraction is a lot less bad than what i first thought when reading that
2010-11-30T08:41:26  <Error323> or no he got castrated
2010-11-30T08:41:29  <Error323> instead of banned iirc
2010-11-30T08:41:34  <Error323> he could chose
2010-11-30T08:41:36  <antimatroid> not that it isn't terrible, just not what i pictured :)
2010-11-30T08:41:58  <davidd> if you use a computer you use a gay invention

2010-11-30T08:47:38  <antimatroid> i've been quite surprised at how racist some people in australia have been the last few years, at first i thought the media was being retarded, but there's been some pretty bad attacks
2010-11-30T08:48:01  <antimatroid> some guy i have actually personally met and have known about for a while raped and killed a chinese uni chick last year :\
2010-11-30T08:48:06  <antimatroid> the piece of scum is now behind bars

2010-11-30T08:49:31  <GreenTea> so many maps with close start planets..
2010-11-30T08:49:37  <antimatroid> ;;;; This file must be here because the contest server compile ;;;; environment relies on it to recognize that it is a Common Lisp ;;;; submission. :D
2010-11-30T08:49:50  <antimatroid> GreenTea: sorry :(
2010-11-30T08:50:04  <GreenTea> No, this is good for me)
2010-11-30T08:50:13  <antimatroid> i was in favour of possibly increasing the min starting angle distance
2010-11-30T08:50:21  <antimatroid> ah okay, then you're welcome :P
2010-11-30T08:50:22  <Error323> the new mapset has been horror for me btw
2010-11-30T08:50:22  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-30T08:50:32  <antimatroid> i don't think it did me any favours :P
2010-11-30T08:50:40  <antimatroid> but i think it was better
2010-11-30T08:50:45  <antimatroid> should have been earlier
2010-11-30T08:51:10  <Error323> ye
2010-11-30T08:51:14  <Error323> oh well
2010-11-30T08:51:40  <antimatroid> actually, i wouldn't have a clue how to do symmetric maps for 2 player mario kart
2010-11-30T08:52:01  <antimatroid> except maybe have them start in the same place, then once separated you can't go through each other anymore
2010-11-30T08:52:40  <Error323> imo: RTS game, or something like transport tycoon would be cool aswell
2010-11-30T08:53:52  <antimatroid> with mario, think controls could just be, set acceleration/deacceration (max jump size specified), max speed, set rate of angle turn (max rate specified) and fire weapon
2010-11-30T08:54:19  <antimatroid> and possibly all flat maps
2010-11-30T08:55:14  <antimatroid> then weapons could be bots? that do their own specified thing
2010-11-30T08:55:40  <davidd> Error323 the anti-computer/anti-internet crowd is a group i dont take that seriously, although they may really mean what they say
2010-11-30T08:55:43  <Error323> mega1: wasn't maxplanets > 23?
2010-11-30T08:55:52  <davidd> and i think it is safe to post that link here
2010-11-30T08:56:00  <Error323> haha ofc
2010-11-30T08:56:02  <mega1> Error323: yes, I forgot to change that

2010-11-30T10:16:57  <antimatroid> a couple, not all
2010-11-30T10:17:05  <JamesMG> those are the ones that scare me
2010-11-30T10:17:13  <antimatroid> i'm in 33rd though, so it hasn't hurt me
2010-11-30T10:17:23  <antimatroid> i don't think it'd be much higher without them
2010-11-30T10:17:43  <JamesMG> mine isn't going to do particularly well either way
2010-11-30T10:18:11  <antimatroid> i'll just keep grumbling to myself "next time" :)
2010-11-30T10:18:25  <Error323> i wanna know when the next contest will be :P
2010-11-30T10:18:38  <antimatroid> i'd say around jan-march next year it will start
2010-11-30T10:18:58  <antimatroid> but that's a guess based off of tron and this
2010-11-30T10:18:59  <Error323> oh that's pretty quick
2010-11-30T10:19:09  <antimatroid> fron ended in february :P
2010-11-30T10:19:12  <antimatroid> tron*

2010-11-30T10:24:27  <antimatroid> i really like the idea of group contests as well next time
2010-11-30T10:24:50  <antimatroid> where websites/rufes band etc. make a group, and separate to the final contest a contest and leaderboard is generated souly for that group
2010-11-30T10:25:00  <antimatroid> and irc group could even be made :D
2010-11-30T10:25:24  <antimatroid> but obviously games for those can't be counted towards the official contest
2010-11-30T10:25:57  <antimatroid> 90% of all users would be in the reddit group ehe
2010-11-30T10:26:21  <mega1> I don't even know how to compare countries in this contest.
2010-11-30T10:26:52  <antimatroid> i think last tiem they just did number of bots in top 200, then tie broke on highest ranked bot
2010-11-30T10:27:13  <antimatroid> seems reasonable enough
2010-11-30T10:27:30  <antimatroid> but don't even need to do a ranking across groups, just inside each one
2010-11-30T10:28:03  <antimatroid> it feels weird to say groups in the normal sense after two years of algebra classes
2010-11-30T10:30:11  <mega1> I'd probably try to fit a suitable distribution to the elo points or the ranks
2010-11-30T10:31:17  <mega1> or just lump together their games in the top 200 and calc bayeselo
2010-11-30T10:36:22  <Error323> that's a good idea =)

2010-11-30T11:59:39  <Error323> yep
2010-11-30T11:59:57  <janzert1> just a comment if you make the pairing cutoff too narrow the nature of the field of players changes too much as well, any narrowing is of course a trade off on this
2010-11-30T12:00:04  *** janzert1 is now known as janzert
2010-11-30T12:00:20  <Error323> janzert: yeah e.g. mistmanov would go through the roof
2010-11-30T12:00:24  <antimatroid> janzert: i like the idea of 100 bots running for a day
2010-11-30T12:00:25  <Error323> whilest i would drop :P
2010-11-30T12:00:52  <antimatroid> what happens atm if a bot drops below the cutoff?
2010-11-30T12:01:00  <antimatroid> does the bot coming above get  more games?
2010-11-30T12:01:40  <antimatroid> that's a bit iffy i think, maybe it shouldn't be made so low
2010-11-30T12:02:01  <janzert> also even if we narrow it top 100 it still won't be enough to get confidence in the ordering, that would require thousands of games per bot
2010-11-30T12:02:05  <Error323> imo cutoff is quite dangerous
2010-11-30T12:02:16  <janzert> since there are such small differences in strength
2010-11-30T12:02:21  <Error323> ye

2010-11-30T12:02:25  <Mistmanov> sure, you still wouldn't be 100% certain, but it would certainly be better right
2010-11-30T12:02:35  <antimatroid> although, atm i think the top 10 is sorting itself out reasonably well
2010-11-30T12:02:57  <janzert> btw, I made a post more or less related to this just now in this thread
2010-11-30T12:02:58  <janzert> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1192&view=unread#unread
2010-11-30T12:03:02  <antimatroid> 4-7 is undecided
2010-11-30T12:04:30  <mega1> janzert: any chance to run only a single game at a time?
2010-11-30T12:04:30  <antimatroid> i am personally predicting top 3 stays as is
2010-11-30T12:04:41  <Error323> I think narrowing cutoff should be done really really carefully now :S
2010-11-30T12:04:45  <antimatroid> mega1: can't fairly change that now

2010-11-30T12:07:04  <janzert> I do believe it will probably be early evening (eastern time) though

2010-11-30T12:10:25  <mega1> about 30 I think

2010-11-30T12:10:45  <meneky_> thanks
2010-11-30T12:10:58  <Frontier> politics ... win?
2010-11-30T12:11:03  <janzert> yes, somewhere around 30
2010-11-30T12:11:14  <janzert> hours left that is
2010-11-30T12:11:23  <Error323> that's quite a lot still
2010-11-30T12:11:52  <Error323> Mistmanov: 30 hrs for you left to go up 4 places :P
2010-11-30T12:11:58  <Error323> or 5
2010-11-30T12:12:13  <rebelxt> heh i was hoping all of us could relax a little sooner than in 30 hours ;-)
2010-11-30T12:12:55  <Mistmanov> I actually think it's not very much :p
2010-11-30T12:12:56  <antimatroid> i don't think anyone is going to shift too much at this point
2010-11-30T12:13:00  <Frontier> I use my Gnome calender 'Evolution' for the time zone conversion including daylight saving time. It works well with the Vancouver time zone. Hopefully that was the right one ^^
2010-11-30T12:13:06  <Mistmanov> I've played like.. 5 games total against top50 bots?
2010-11-30T12:13:13  <Mistmanov> Should count them
2010-11-30T12:13:36  <Error323> that's because you were stalling in the 200 area quite some time
2010-11-30T12:13:47  <Mistmanov> (ok, so maybe I don't desrve to be there.. but I was there like the day before the contest closed :( )
2010-11-30T12:13:57  <rebelxt> Mistmanov: i don't mind if we run it for another week ;) i just have to stop checking my bot's status during the day when it normally sucks
2010-11-30T12:14:10  <antimatroid> Mistmanov: rankings then weren't very representative of bots abilities :)
2010-11-30T12:14:16  <antimatroid> no offense :)
2010-11-30T12:14:17  <Mistmanov> yeah I know :p
2010-11-30T12:14:27  <antimatroid> my smileys broke
2010-11-30T12:14:50  <Mistmanov> ugh, I'm turning into a grumpy old man

2010-11-30T12:15:01  <rebelxt> that's due to a lot of people submitting strong bots at the last minute... antimatroid, mcleopold, and many others ;-)
2010-11-30T12:15:17  <antimatroid> that's how we roll
2010-11-30T12:15:18  <Error323> yea

2010-11-30T12:15:48  <antimatroid> i want to see someone submit an unknown winning bot in the last few days
2010-11-30T12:15:49  <Error323> i'm facing a concrete wall reinforced with steel atm
2010-11-30T12:15:51  <antimatroid> that'd be cool
2010-11-30T12:16:01  <Mistmanov> I know that if someone else was whining about how he should be ranked higher, I'd find it extremely annoying <<--- I'm probably being really annoying myself -_-
2010-11-30T12:16:13  <antimatroid> Mistmanov: not at all
2010-11-30T12:16:15  * Mistmanov tries to shut up
2010-11-30T12:16:20  <antimatroid> we all find things to bitch about :)
2010-11-30T12:16:26  <Error323> lol, idd
2010-11-30T12:16:26  <Frontier> You could create a new account with the same email address and upload your bot.
2010-11-30T12:16:39  <Error323> second mapset is horror for my bot chiting bitches
2010-11-30T12:16:57  <Frontier> antimatroid: that would look like an unknown competitor, but is really you in disguise
2010-11-30T12:17:00  * Error323 learned a new word here
2010-11-30T12:17:25  <Frontier> what does chiting mean? isn't that one of accouns inventions?
2010-11-30T12:17:32  <Error323> Frontier: you'd get disqualified
2010-11-30T12:17:54  <amstan> Frontier: combination of 2 words, i'll let you figure it out, lol
2010-11-30T12:18:06  <Error323> :P
2010-11-30T12:18:42  <Frontier> Error323: I know from a reliable source that a new account created with the same email address just deactivates the old account
2010-11-30T12:18:56  <Error323> oh
2010-11-30T12:18:59  <antimatroid> Frontier: that's because the admins were nice
2010-11-30T12:19:05  <antimatroid> it was done manuelly
2010-11-30T12:19:27  <antimatroid> at least i'm pretty sure that'd how it went down
2010-11-30T12:19:37  <antimatroid> that's**
2010-11-30T12:19:44  <Error323> if this restriction wasn't met, i think the amount of bots would be tripled :P
2010-11-30T12:19:54  <Error323> atleast
2010-11-30T12:20:01  <antimatroid> i don't
2010-11-30T12:20:05  <antimatroid> most people saw the rules
2010-11-30T12:20:16  <Error323> without that rule i mean
2010-11-30T12:20:17  <Frontier> or maybe the database just overwrote the old entry for that email address and now it is totally messed up with submissions belonging to a NULL entry...
2010-11-30T12:20:26  <antimatroid> ahhh, yeah not a fair contest then
2010-11-30T12:20:44  <antimatroid> you would be uplaoding thousands of bots with a ranking system to try and make one do better
2010-11-30T12:21:17  <janzert> the duplicate accounts were manually deactivated
2010-11-30T12:21:52  <Frontier> Yeah one bot could always yell "Itsa me Mario" and the other bot, Luigi will lose intenttionally so Mario gets the ELO benefit.
2010-11-30T12:22:14  <antimatroid> yep, although you'd wait till well into the game before signalling each other
2010-11-30T12:22:19  <Error323> janzert: do you think its possible for the next contest to have some i/o space? so stuff like reinforcement learning may be possible

2010-11-30T12:23:07  <JamesMG> bummer, I'm up to 4 turn 1 crashes today now
2010-11-30T12:23:15  <amstan> well.. i'm not sure about storage space, there's not really any benefit to using it
2010-11-30T12:23:25  <antimatroid> i have had an increase in crashes today too
2010-11-30T12:23:31  <Error323> amstan: imo there is
2010-11-30T12:23:33  <antimatroid> janzert: have there been a spike in crashes?
2010-11-30T12:23:37  <amstan> the only way to write that io space is from games.. but the devs have logs of all the games already
2010-11-30T12:23:39  <janzert> amstan: sure there is, map information and such
2010-11-30T12:23:41  <amstan> he can just fill tehm offline
2010-11-30T12:23:45  <Error323> learning bots is more awesome
2010-11-30T12:23:54  <amstan> Error323: you can already do this..
2010-11-30T12:24:00  <amstan> you just have to reupload
2010-11-30T12:24:03  <antimatroid> janzert: you can already read from files yeah?
2010-11-30T12:24:06  <janzert> with new maps generated after final submission there isn't anyway to add the precalculated data
2010-11-30T12:24:15  <amstan> janzert: i guess
2010-11-30T12:24:17  <janzert> antimatroid: yes, you can
2010-11-30T12:24:32  <Error323> online learning is still not possible
2010-11-30T12:24:36  <antimatroid> hmmm, i like people not knowing a map before starting
2010-11-30T12:24:38  <Error323> which is quite important
2010-11-30T12:24:42  <janzert> antimatroid: no, not that I'm seeing
2010-11-30T12:24:48  <amstan> i guess you could do some map caching
2010-11-30T12:24:49  <antimatroid> i wanted to go to a new map for every game
2010-11-30T12:25:01  <amstan> but if we have i/o we'll have to give devs access to that space..
2010-11-30T12:25:08  <antimatroid> the problem with online learning is it fucks up rankings
2010-11-30T12:25:15  <amstan> and if there's a security problem or something and they cat /etc/passwd then they'll have access to it
2010-11-30T12:25:20  <antimatroid> the bot one person plays at the start of the contest is not the bot someone else plays at the end
2010-11-30T12:25:21  <janzert> amstan: yes, it's not a simple thing to do for sure
2010-11-30T12:25:28  <antimatroid> you can train like that before the final contest
2010-11-30T12:25:32  <antimatroid> what's wrong with doing it then?
2010-11-30T12:25:32  <amstan> right now, the only want to extract info from your bot is to encode it in your games
2010-11-30T12:26:02  <JamesMG> maybe allow the bots to do FTP I/O to the dev's own server?
2010-11-30T12:26:08  <Error323> antimatroid: oh i don't know... a mapchange 20 days before deadline perhaps :P
2010-11-30T12:26:09  <JamesMG> could be abused though
2010-11-30T12:26:20  <antimatroid> Error323: maps were never set
2010-11-30T12:26:28  <janzert> I do think we really should give players more access to the bot output just so debugging can be easier.
2010-11-30T12:26:41  <Error323> antimatroid: not the point :P
2010-11-30T12:26:54  <janzert> but yes any additional access to feedback from the bots makes any security problems worse
2010-11-30T12:26:58  <JamesMG> is there a way to see how many of my games I've crashed out on turn 1 without watching them all?
2010-11-30T12:26:59  <Error323> changes like that require online learning
2010-11-30T12:27:15  <Frontier> amstan: there are no passwords in "cat /etc/passwd", they hopefully are in /etc/shadow

2010-11-30T12:27:28  <antimatroid> you see the problem with a bot that learns during the contest though right?
2010-11-30T12:27:37  <antimatroid> i think that's a pretty big deal breaker
2010-11-30T12:28:04  <bhasker> my bot has not been having a great day today:-(
2010-11-30T12:28:17  <antimatroid> people can use the new official tcp server to train their bot leading up to the contest
2010-11-30T12:28:34  <mightybyte> Hey amstan, I saw your forum post about persistence.
2010-11-30T12:28:57  <mightybyte> I think you could avoid the need to allow persistence by changing the engine protocol.
2010-11-30T12:29:42  <mightybyte> All you have to do is play multiple games in one execution of the bot.
2010-11-30T12:30:18  <bhasker> oh mega1 released his sourcecode
2010-11-30T12:30:24  <Error323> yeep
2010-11-30T12:30:25  <Frontier> omg omg omg
2010-11-30T12:30:43  <mightybyte> With symmetric maps and near-optimal play, planetwars essentially becomes a ro-sham-bo-type problem.

2010-11-30T12:49:13  <bhasker> at end of turn
2010-11-30T12:49:19  <bhasker> i calculate how many ships are incoming to my planets
2010-11-30T12:49:26  <bhasker> and do a crude rate of flow calculation
2010-11-30T12:49:32  <bhasker> and try to send ships preemptively
2010-11-30T12:49:35  <bhasker> to my planets
2010-11-30T12:49:49  <bhasker> though that tends to kind of mess up with large attacks
2010-11-30T12:50:30  <Frontier> mega1: "The official server is running the ancient sbcl 1.0.11 [...]" ...so you had the same troubles as the C# guys
2010-11-30T12:50:39  <amstan> mega1: pretty cool
2010-11-30T12:51:13  <mega1> Frontier: what is the exact trouble the C# guys are having? old mono?
2010-11-30T12:51:42  <Frontier> yeah, congratulations! - yes the old mono version that wouldn't compile their code.
2010-11-30T12:52:29  <bhasker> rebel do you think our bots will climb much further? i really have my doubts
2010-11-30T12:52:34  <bhasker> i think we are stuck in 45-55 range
2010-11-30T12:52:36  <amstan> i like how accoun demands that we just manually change the rankings so he's second
2010-11-30T12:52:36  <bhasker> for good:)
2010-11-30T12:53:43  <rebelxt> bhasker: yeah, i don't see a reason why my bot should climb. it's roughly where it deserves to be ;)
2010-11-30T12:53:44  <Frontier> mega1: You might want to take a look at http://clojure.org/. A lisp dialect compiling to Java Byte-Code. Perhaps it is worth a look, I don't know
2010-11-30T12:53:52  <bhasker> yea same here
2010-11-30T12:54:15  <bhasker> i never understood the need to compile everything to run on jvm
2010-11-30T12:54:20  <bhasker> jvm is so freaking slow
2010-11-30T12:55:06  <amstan> bhasker: cross platform?
2010-11-30T12:55:26  <bhasker> frankly unless its a client app cross platform is a very weak argument
2010-11-30T12:55:47  <bhasker> in most cases moving platforms is such a high barrier that language is a very small part of it
2010-11-30T12:56:29  <bhasker> and if you are writing in c# why compile it to jvm or lisp to jvm
2010-11-30T12:56:36  <bhasker> c# in most cases you have mono
2010-11-30T12:56:45  <bhasker> lisp has its own implementations on most platforms
2010-11-30T12:56:58  <bhasker> so where is the benefit in compiling down to jvm unless you want to use some specific java feature?
2010-11-30T12:58:13  <rebelxt> bhasker: one argument in favor of java is amount of open source code. it's pretty easy to build web sites and business software with it using 100% open source
2010-11-30T12:58:34  <bhasker> i am not so sure, java as a middle tier sure
2010-11-30T12:58:47  *** Apophis <Apophis!~apophis@80-219-211-230.dclient.hispeed.ch> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-30T12:58:48  <bhasker> i hate websites written in JSP
2010-11-30T12:58:53  <bhasker> the are routinely slow as hell
2010-11-30T12:59:18  <bhasker> and i don't know of any major web company that runs stuff written in jsp etc
2010-11-30T12:59:40  <bhasker> google does most of its stuff in python, yahoo in php + c/c++ modules
2010-11-30T12:59:40  <mightybyte> bhasker: Java is actually quite fast.
2010-11-30T12:59:51  <rebelxt> JSP was bad.. i stopped using it many years ago
2010-11-30T13:00:12  <bhasker> mighty: my experience has not been the same, jvm is such a memory hog
2010-11-30T13:00:36  <bhasker> java has other advantages, but i don't think execution speed is necessarily one of them
2010-11-30T13:00:41  <bhasker> the start up time of jvm is horrible
2010-11-30T13:00:44  <mightybyte> bhasker: I've had a Java matrix math library perform faster than the C++ library it was ported from.
2010-11-30T13:00:56  <bhasker> the c++ library was probably poorly written
2010-11-30T13:01:02  <mightybyte> start up time is frequently not an issue
2010-11-30T13:01:13  <mightybyte> bhasker: It was a direct translation
2010-11-30T13:01:47  <bhasker> i really doubt java interpreted byte code can beat a similarly implemented c++ code unless it was JIT compiled
2010-11-30T13:01:59  <bhasker> even then it will probably be a close match up
2010-11-30T13:02:18  <bhasker> and it will depend on what kind of optimizations are turned on in c++ build
2010-11-30T13:02:18  <mightybyte> Well, I have numbers that prove otherwise.
2010-11-30T13:02:34  <rebelxt> here is a programming language performance comparison which matched my own tests a couple of years ago (c++ vs java vs python)
2010-11-30T13:02:36  <rebelxt> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php
2010-11-30T13:03:48  <mightybyte> It's not always faster, but in some cases it is, and it's usually at least competitive.
2010-11-30T13:05:49  <rebelxt> mightybyte: kinda surprised java beat c++ on math problem. c++ normally beats java -server unless c++ code is not optimized at all
2010-11-30T13:06:08  <mightybyte> I was surprised too.
2010-11-30T13:06:12  <bhasker> also java doesn't make great use of multicore processors
2010-11-30T13:06:24  <mightybyte> bhasker: And C++ does?
2010-11-30T13:06:25  <bhasker> its kind of retarded that so  many jvms cant make good use of multicore
2010-11-30T13:06:25  <rebelxt> LISP SBCL is pretty fast
2010-11-30T13:06:34  <bhasker> yes c++ does
2010-11-30T13:06:43  <bhasker> fork 4tw
2010-11-30T13:06:46  <bhasker> or native threads
2010-11-30T13:06:49  <mightybyte> bhasker: Oh please
2010-11-30T13:07:07  <bhasker> err loading up 8jvm instances to make use of 8 processors seems kind of wasteful?
2010-11-30T13:07:14  <mightybyte> Java's threading is vastly nicer than C++ fork
2010-11-30T13:07:25  <bhasker> yes but the jvm itself is tied to a single core
2010-11-30T13:07:34  <bhasker> so threads != multicore usage
2010-11-30T13:07:55  <mightybyte> bhasker = ignorant
2010-11-30T13:08:00  <bhasker> from what i can read java7 probably has some new stuff to make multicore usage
2010-11-30T13:08:51  <bhasker> please explain how the jvm you have on your box makes use of more than one core
2010-11-30T13:09:16  <bhasker> at least the jvm i have on my mac or bsd doesn't do it at all
2010-11-30T13:09:27  <bhasker> i haven't looked at the linux jvms very closely
2010-11-30T13:09:33  <bhasker> so i may be wrong
2010-11-30T13:10:48  <Frontier> rebelext and mightybyte: when I graph the languages like that: http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php?gpp=on&java=on&fpascal=on&sbcl=on&python3=on&calc=chart C++ has the smalles time share by far
2010-11-30T13:11:32  <Frontier> fork is a unix system call. it can be done with other techniques by now, like posix threads ;)
2010-11-30T13:12:03  <bhasker> as i said native threads:) which are usually posix api based
2010-11-30T13:12:08  <bhasker> fork has its benefits
2010-11-30T13:12:24  <bhasker> especially in server environments where segregating user data is criticial
2010-11-30T13:12:41  <rebelxt> Frontier: well, i look at the raw numbers (median)
2010-11-30T13:12:46  <bhasker> chances of stomping over wrong users data due to programming errors are less
2010-11-30T13:13:01  <mightybyte> I'm not arguing that C++ doesn't give you the power to do effective low-level optimizations that can't be done on the JVM.  I'm saying that I took a reasonably written (but not super-optimized) C++ matrix library, did a direct translation to Java, and got comparable (and sometimes slightly) better performance from Java.
2010-11-30T13:13:27  <bhasker> mighty its possible, in most cases though if you turn on the right optimizations c++ will usually beat java
2010-11-30T13:13:46  <bhasker> unless you use a JIT compiler
2010-11-30T13:13:49  <Frontier> rebelext: smaller numbers are better :p
2010-11-30T13:13:56  <bhasker> in which case java will be close to c++
2010-11-30T13:14:29  <rebelxt> if you start two threads in java on a dual core cpu, they make use of both cores just fine. of course when you sort a collection it only uses single core.. java 7 should have fork-join support i heard
2010-11-30T13:14:50  <rebelxt> Frontier: that's not what she said

2010-11-30T13:17:15  <Frontier> mightybyte: what classes did you use for the matrix in C++ and Java?
2010-11-30T13:17:33  <mightybyte> We wrote our own.
2010-11-30T13:17:40  <mightybyte> That's precisely my point.
2010-11-30T13:19:12  <rebelxt> i should open source my c++ bot too.. just so that people can do c++ vs python performance comparo if interested. it was not pretty ;-)

2010-11-30T13:20:18  <janzert> I'm curious what sort of speed up it might give
2010-11-30T13:20:40  <rebelxt> janzert: i built latest pypy and tried but could not get it to work
2010-11-30T13:20:46  <janzert> ahh :(
2010-11-30T13:22:01  <rebelxt> translation ran for almost an hour and failed hard.. i just had no time to figure out what exactly was going on
2010-11-30T13:22:02  <Frontier> mightybyte: Yes, but did you use vector<vector<double>> or did you use float or long double? And what did you use in Java? fixed arrays or lists?
2010-11-30T13:22:48  <janzert> I know last time I tried it (although it's been a few years) it took huge amounts of memory for translation to complete
2010-11-30T13:23:24  <mightybyte> Frontier: I used fixed arrays.  It wasn't a best of breed comparison; it was a comparison of exactly analogous programs.

2010-11-30T13:24:16  <bhasker> interesting first time i am reading about pypy
2010-11-30T13:24:17  <mightybyte> In most cases, C++ was slightly faster.
2010-11-30T13:24:18  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-30T13:24:40  <mightybyte> But there was at least one case where Java was faster.  I was quite surprised initially.
2010-11-30T13:25:10  <mightybyte> I assumed we had done something wrong, and maybe the computations were getting completetly optimized away, but that was not the case.

2010-11-30T17:26:07  <Error323> amstan: is there an exact time when the contest stops yet?
2010-11-30T17:26:26  <GreenTea_> want to ask the same question)
2010-11-30T17:26:34  <amstan> the time is wed
2010-11-30T17:26:47  <amstan> where the difference between the closing time and results time = d
2010-11-30T17:26:51  <amstan> and d%24hours=0
2010-11-30T17:26:57  <Error323> lol
2010-11-30T17:27:01  <Error323> so that's a no then :P
2010-11-30T17:27:16  <amstan> that will probably it
2010-11-30T17:27:24  <amstan> so... at the same time that the contest closed
2010-11-30T17:27:38  <BaronTrozo> the Pairing cutoff is going to stop at some point??
2010-11-30T17:28:26  <Error323> it must, because otherwise results will be biased and wrong
2010-11-30T17:29:52  <BaronTrozo> is this point public??

2010-11-30T17:42:12  <amstan> but i am unsure
2010-11-30T17:42:35  <BaronTrozo> ?????????????
2010-11-30T17:42:41  <BaronTrozo> i don't understand
2010-11-30T17:43:08  <BaronTrozo> the organization still don't know when this is going to be closed???
2010-11-30T17:43:53  <BaronTrozo> is a question, not a reclaim
2010-11-30T17:44:47  <amstan> i already told you what i think
2010-11-30T17:44:51  <BaronTrozo> I prefer that the contest takes longer as at the moment i'm climing up on the rank
2010-11-30T17:45:01  <amstan> i don't have any more info, ask janzert or jeff
2010-11-30T17:45:23  <Zannick> the intent i believe is to let it run until the rankings are fairly stable
2010-11-30T17:45:24  <BaronTrozo> okey, thanks for all
2010-11-30T17:46:01  <BaronTrozo> Zannick: but a total stabilzed maybe imposible, no??
2010-11-30T17:46:37  <Zannick> BaronTrozo: they'll probably stabilize fairly well when the only games being played are between the top 100, maybe
2010-11-30T17:47:34  <Accoun> after all maps be played it what be next?
2010-11-30T17:47:36  <BaronTrozo> I also think the same, but is because my bot take better result with good bots(i don't know the reason) ;)
2010-11-30T17:47:39  <Accoun> it stoped?
2010-11-30T17:47:40  <amstan> i think people will care more about difference between 1 and 2nd than 1000th and 1001st
2010-11-30T17:47:53  <BaronTrozo> true
2010-11-30T17:48:02  <amstan> that's the reason we have the cutoffs
2010-11-30T17:48:18  <BaronTrozo> true -> (1==1)

2010-11-30T17:48:42  <amstan> hmm?
2010-11-30T17:50:24  <BaronTrozo> does this actual decrease of cuttof has a limit???
2010-11-30T17:50:38  <BaronTrozo> cutoff, sorry
2010-11-30T17:51:04  <amstan> define limit, give me an example

2010-11-30T17:52:56  <BaronTrozo> Very sorry for my poor english
2010-11-30T17:53:34  <sigh> haha...it would be funny if the cutoff went all the way to 2, even more funny if that resulted in #2 being demoted
2010-11-30T17:53:52  <Zannick> and then #3 suddenly has another fighting chance

2010-11-30T18:02:49  <Error323> if you let this cutoff go on the entire top 100 will change

2010-11-30T18:05:07  <janzert> once Jeff gives me a firm time I'll post it in the finals information thread as well
2010-11-30T18:05:18  <BaronTrozo> the cuttof must be 100 plus something more to let people have the oportunity of fighting for top100
2010-11-30T18:05:27  <sigh> I think 1000 is fine?
2010-11-30T18:05:35  <BaronTrozo> 150
2010-11-30T18:05:40  <Error323> even 1000 is already dangerous

2010-11-30T18:06:14  <sigh> BaronTrozo: 150 is no good... people below 150 still get wins against top 100 or top 50
2010-11-30T18:06:21  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-30T18:06:30  <Error323> and the same happens all across the system

2010-11-30T18:06:47  <sigh> *beaten
2010-11-30T18:07:11  <BaronTrozo> yeah but with this we stabilzed better the high positions, but this is only my oppinion
2010-11-30T18:07:21  <Error323> BaronTrozo: no we don't
2010-11-30T18:07:41  <Error323> there are very agressive strategies in play that win of top 100 bots a lot
2010-11-30T18:07:45  <Error323> but also lose of < 200
2010-11-30T18:07:52  <Error323> if you remove everything < 200
2010-11-30T18:07:55  <Error323> they will climb
2010-11-30T18:08:02  <BaronTrozo> okey, don't worry it will be waht organization decides, not what i decide
2010-11-30T18:08:04  <Error323> which imo is unfair
2010-11-30T18:08:23  <Error323> yes i know, but it just surprises me ppl don't realize this
2010-11-30T18:08:59  <JamesMG> I'll be sad if my bot gets eliminated from the final competition
2010-11-30T18:09:06  <JamesMG> even though it is well deserved
2010-11-30T18:09:52  <bhasker>  hah back in top 50
2010-11-30T18:09:58  <BaronTrozo> each one of us has his own oppinion, and his own reasons so it's better to wait for the organization
2010-11-30T18:11:02  <bhasker> my bot is like hanging at 50 by its teeth

2010-11-30T18:19:13  <bhasker>  i have a few ideas that i want to develop
2010-11-30T18:19:20  <Error323> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9417096 lol
2010-11-30T18:19:29  <bhasker> though i am planning to use panda3d
2010-11-30T18:19:33  <bhasker> to save myself the pain of coding in c++
2010-11-30T18:19:41  <sigh> bhasker: lack of time, really
2010-11-30T18:19:45  <JamesMG> never looked at panda3d, will have to
2010-11-30T18:20:18  <bhasker> panda3d is engine used by disney for their pirates game
2010-11-30T18:20:22  <sigh> also, frustration at having a lot of stuff I did just not working :P
2010-11-30T18:20:22  <bhasker> its mostly c++ core
2010-11-30T18:20:26  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-30T18:20:30  <bhasker> with python wrapper apis
2010-11-30T18:20:34  <meneky> i'm a hobbyist game programmer too :)
2010-11-30T18:20:36  <bhasker> which are very nice
2010-11-30T18:20:45  <bhasker> so makes for really quick development
2010-11-30T18:20:48  <Error323> so am I
2010-11-30T18:20:51  <Error323> well AI programmer
2010-11-30T18:20:59  <JamesMG> so you layer game code as python on top of the engine?
2010-11-30T18:20:59  <bhasker> well my plan is to write an RTS
2010-11-30T18:21:06  <bhasker> yup
2010-11-30T18:21:16  <bhasker> they even have support for distributed objects
2010-11-30T18:21:21  <JamesMG> I am planning to use the next AI contest to learn python I think
2010-11-30T18:21:29  <bhasker> since they use it for their MMO
2010-11-30T18:21:36  <Error323> i might give lisp a shot
2010-11-30T18:21:41  <Accoun> so am I well www.1c.ru russian version of enterprise java programmer
2010-11-30T18:21:42  <Error323> been wanting to learn that language
2010-11-30T18:21:43  <BaronTrozo> Here in spain is to late, so good night, and good luck to all
2010-11-30T18:21:51  <Error323> gnite BaronTrozo
2010-11-30T18:21:52  <bhasker> lisp frankly looks uninteresting the damn syntax is annoying
2010-11-30T18:22:02  <bhasker> i hate updating my .emacs
2010-11-30T18:22:04  <Error323> its very powerfull and fast
2010-11-30T18:22:06  <bhasker> yes
2010-11-30T18:22:07  <Error323> me vim user
2010-11-30T18:22:13  <bhasker> but the syntax just drives me nuts
2010-11-30T18:22:14  <JamesMG> bhasker: we should talk more, might be fun to do an open source game
2010-11-30T18:22:19  <bhasker> sure
2010-11-30T18:22:20  <JamesMG> I have to go for tonight though

2010-11-30T18:27:39  <bhasker> try using panda3d:)
2010-11-30T18:27:42  <bhasker> will save you a lot of time
2010-11-30T18:27:43  <meneky> but simpler
2010-11-30T18:27:46  <meneky> sure
2010-11-30T18:27:50  <bhasker> from scratch is painful
2010-11-30T18:27:52  <meneky> but where is the fun then?
2010-11-30T18:27:58  <bhasker> writing all the math classes and transforms
2010-11-30T18:28:00  <Error323> heh
2010-11-30T18:28:07  <bhasker> well depends what you are really trying to do
2010-11-30T18:28:09  <bhasker> write the game?
2010-11-30T18:28:13  <bhasker> or write the engine:)
2010-11-30T18:28:41  <bhasker> whenever i try to write from scratch i lose interest midway since writing all the boilerplate code is only fun so many times
2010-11-30T18:28:55  <meneky> yes, thats true
2010-11-30T18:29:03  <Error323> jep
2010-11-30T18:29:15  <meneky> the engine is already done (but evolving) now i'm workint in entity and scenario editors
2010-11-30T18:29:18  <meneky> lots of work
2010-11-30T18:29:50  <bhasker> yea well panda comes with a lot of that
2010-11-30T18:29:54  <bhasker> it has a scene editor too now
2010-11-30T18:29:56  <bhasker> i think*
2010-11-30T18:30:04  <Error323> i've seen panda
2010-11-30T18:30:06  <bhasker> and being python almost everything is scriptable
2010-11-30T18:30:07  <Error323> it looks pretty good
2010-11-30T18:30:16  <bhasker> the channel for panda is on this server
2010-11-30T18:30:18  <bhasker> #panda3d
2010-11-30T18:30:23  <Error323> http://www.panda3d.org/
2010-11-30T18:30:27  <bhasker> thats where most of the main developers hang out
2010-11-30T18:30:32  <bhasker> quite helpful lot
2010-11-30T18:31:12  <bhasker> the neat thing about the library also is its pstats support
2010-11-30T18:31:18  <bhasker> basicaly it has profiling built in
2010-11-30T18:31:23  <bhasker> instrumentation
2010-11-30T18:31:24  <bhasker> rather
2010-11-30T18:31:35  <bhasker> you can plot graphs of time spent in each function/class etc live

2010-11-30T18:31:41  <bhasker> as your program is running
2010-11-30T18:31:45  <bhasker> pretty neat instrumentation stuff
2010-11-30T18:31:51  <Error323> cool
2010-11-30T18:34:25  <bhasker> the only downside is you can't do any threading
2010-11-30T18:34:33  <bhasker> at least not in 1.7 version
2010-11-30T18:34:36  <bhasker> next one will support some
2010-11-30T18:34:51  <bhasker> the python interpreter prevents threading from using multiple cores due to its GIL
2010-11-30T18:35:09  <bhasker> though you could just use the C++ api straight if you wanted threading
2010-11-30T18:35:38  <bhasker> btw do you guys read this guys page

2010-11-30T18:47:28  <bhasker> interesting
2010-11-30T18:47:33  <bhasker> mega1s bot played iouri 3 times
2010-11-30T18:47:35  <bhasker> and lost all 3 games
2010-11-30T18:47:54  <Error323> its pure luck or not enough cpu time
2010-11-30T18:48:02  <Error323> locally here mega1 rapes iouri

2010-11-30T18:48:36  <bhasker> have you tested other bots against mega1
2010-11-30T18:48:41  <Error323> yes
2010-11-30T18:48:45  <Error323> its interesting
2010-11-30T18:48:56  <Error323> mistmanov's bot for example wins 48 times iirc
2010-11-30T18:49:08  <bhasker> 48 out of 150 thats quite good
2010-11-30T18:49:16  <bhasker> what about mine:)
2010-11-30T18:49:22  <Error323> but also loses ~50 times from someone in the 500 ranks
2010-11-30T18:49:28  <bhasker> hehe
2010-11-30T18:49:32  <Error323> he just has a very dangerous strategy
2010-11-30T18:49:34  <sigh> oh, mega1 has released his code?

2010-11-30T18:50:18  <bhasker> quite well commented code at that sigh
2010-11-30T18:50:25  <sigh> cool :)
2010-11-30T18:51:09  <Error323> i've been optimizing my bot against a friend of mine

2010-11-30T18:51:15  <Error323> :(
2010-11-30T18:51:19  <Error323> i rape him
2010-11-30T18:51:29  <Error323> but do much worse against oothers as a sideeffect lol

2010-11-30T19:06:45  <Error323> he'd beat him like 90% or sth
2010-11-30T19:06:54  <Error323> oh that sux
2010-11-30T19:07:12  <McLeopold> Yeah, it's cause it has so many "options" that it needs to sort through.
2010-11-30T19:07:56  <McLeopold> Once the results are in, I'm going to get the raw pgn files, switch my timesouts to wins, and console myself with what could have been.

2010-11-30T20:03:03  <burny> woah.. I've moved up like 15 ranks since earlier today
2010-11-30T20:06:25  <McLeopold> rebelxt: what's up
2010-11-30T20:07:10  <bhasker> my bot has put its roots down at 50
2010-11-30T20:07:12  <bhasker> and refuses to budge
2010-11-30T20:07:27  <McLeopold> everyone should be finding their place by now
2010-11-30T20:07:32  <burny> leo: I bet your bot would awon this, if it went longer:  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9428862
2010-11-30T20:08:38  <McLeopold> hmm.. maybe
2010-11-30T20:08:54  <McLeopold> If you bot is deterministic, we could find out...
2010-11-30T20:08:56  <burny> I had position+ship advantage.. but your bot is better lol
2010-11-30T20:09:08  <burny> it is

2010-11-30T20:11:38  <smloh1> nice one, medrimonia!
2010-11-30T20:11:47  <McLeopold> so, I'm working on multiplayer planet wars, who's in?
2010-11-30T20:12:00  <burny> teams, or ffa?
2010-11-30T20:12:02  <rebelxt> McLeopold: wow, both of us are having a rough patch...
2010-11-30T20:12:02  <McLeopold> I've got the game engine.  I'm wrapping up the tcp server.
2010-11-30T20:12:07  <McLeopold> ffa
2010-11-30T20:12:25  <McLeopold> but, I can't stop coordination
2010-11-30T20:12:26  <burny> not me.. I don't like the ffa strat
2010-11-30T20:12:50  <McLeopold> I don't think anyone knows what that is right now
2010-11-30T20:13:11  <McLeopold> Hopefully in a few days you can connect to zeroviz and play multiplayer games.
2010-11-30T20:13:23  <burny> turtle.. and preserve your population as you bounce between planets when attacked, until you can win
2010-11-30T20:14:06  <McLeopold> I could do teams, but we'd all have to agree on some aspects of the game mechanics.
2010-11-30T20:14:31  <smloh1> McLeopold: i would be interested to see how our current bots would do in a multiplayer environment
2010-11-30T20:14:44  <McLeopold> So would I
2010-11-30T20:14:45  <smloh1> probably most of them would freeze up
2010-11-30T20:14:50  <McLeopold> yep :)
2010-11-30T20:14:52  <bhasker> mine would fail spectacularly
2010-11-30T20:14:59  <burny> if you make it appear as all enemy's are team2..
2010-11-30T20:15:03  <bhasker> yea
2010-11-30T20:15:06  <burny> most would not crash
2010-11-30T20:15:10  <burny> but many would sit idle
2010-11-30T20:15:11  <rebelxt> expand, then freeze up, otherwise you lose in FFA
2010-11-30T20:15:13  <bhasker> yup
2010-11-30T20:15:15  <McLeopold> So, basically, the input from the server will have more than 2 owners
2010-11-30T20:15:28  <bhasker> yea well most bots will need some change
2010-11-30T20:15:30  <McLeopold> You will still be player 1
2010-11-30T20:15:32  <bhasker> so handle that
2010-11-30T20:15:41  <bhasker> since it will need to calculate available ships per player etc
2010-11-30T20:15:50  <bhasker> and decide whether to attack user A or B etc
2010-11-30T20:16:02  <bhasker> and differentiate between enemy ships and enemy ships owned by A
2010-11-30T20:16:09  <McLeopold> Yeah, just giving you fair warning if you want to try it out.
2010-11-30T20:16:16  <bhasker> sure i would be game for it
2010-11-30T20:16:23  <bhasker> would be interesting to see
2010-11-30T20:16:36  <bhasker> i will probably write it from scratch this time though
2010-11-30T20:16:58  <rebelxt> McLeopold: need to try our bots in 3-player FFA. if A attacks B, C wins automatically i'm afraid. but i'm game to check if that's the case ;)
2010-11-30T20:17:04  <McLeopold> I'm also going to create a tcp client that will port current bots to play the game.
2010-11-30T20:17:12  <burny> the only way I can see, to reasonably attempt multiplayer with existing bots: is to make the team-mate show up as neutral+100: teammates fleets show up as being your own: and all enemy's show up as team2 with population balanced, to be equal to the total of your controlled ships
2010-11-30T20:17:41  <McLeopold> burny: that's a good idea.
2010-11-30T20:17:48  <bhasker> well A attacks B , b could attack C
2010-11-30T20:17:54  <bhasker> and then its not so certain
2010-11-30T20:18:00  <McLeopold> At least we can see the current bots do something in multiplayer, if not good strategy.
2010-11-30T20:18:09  <burny> so if it's 2vs2.. each player thinks they have a single 100population planet, against 2 50population planets
2010-11-30T20:18:50  <McLeopold> burny: that complication is why I'm going to do ffa only at first.
2010-11-30T20:18:54  <burny> and if team-mates attack each other.. they just give their population to their teammate
2010-11-30T20:19:07  <McLeopold> I figure I'll just show all enemies as owner=2
2010-11-30T20:19:15  <eburnette> Why is the number of games played counting backwards at http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php ?
2010-11-30T20:19:18  <rebelxt> imagine our current bots in 3on3 match. both other players are one enemy with twice as many planets.. most current bots will either do nothing, or expand a bit and then do nothing ;-)
2010-11-30T20:19:21  <burny> leo, I'm sure that almsot all top 500 bots will sit nearly 100% idle in ffa
2010-11-30T20:19:31  <Zannick> eburnette: games played in the last 24 hours
2010-11-30T20:19:34  <rebelxt> err not 3on3.. but 3-player FFA
2010-11-30T20:19:41  <eburnette> ah
2010-11-30T20:19:46  <Zannick> if the gpm 24 hours was greater than it is now, that number will go down
2010-11-30T20:20:01  <burny> I would imagine most bots, on most maps, would not expand atall
2010-11-30T20:20:13  <burny> and the nub bots, would dominate

2010-11-30T20:22:05  <McLeopold> not all bots are passive when behind
2010-11-30T20:23:29  <burny> not all: but most
2010-11-30T20:24:37  <burny> bosco looks like it would do well ffa
2010-11-30T20:24:38  <rebelxt> check out live 4-player games in galcon. they had to introduce self destruct rule (everyone loses if no planet changes hands in 30 seconds) to try and avoid stalemates. it barely helped. 2on2 on the other hand is awesome.. no stalemates
2010-11-30T20:25:10  <medrimonia1> =) I've just done my first win against bocsimacko!

2010-11-30T20:31:56  <burny> might be interesting to see how people's ELO's are, comapred to their 'vs bocs handicap'
2010-11-30T20:32:03  <rebelxt> haha. that's a good idea
2010-11-30T20:32:16  <medrimonia1> even five ships of difference at the beginning is already a lot
2010-11-30T20:32:46  <burny> I bet a 5ship handicap, that bocs would still win more than 50%, against most bots, on most maps
2010-11-30T20:33:12  <medrimonia1> against most bots but not against the top 50 bots I think
2010-11-30T20:33:14  <rebelxt> yep he would probably stay #1 with 1-2 ship handicap
2010-11-30T20:33:58  <eburnette> I think most people would need more than 5
2010-11-30T20:34:06  <rebelxt> actually this is easy to test locally.. will do tonight

2010-11-30T21:15:52  <burny> wasn't
2010-11-30T21:16:03  <burny> I woulda been ahead by 1ship
2010-11-30T21:16:27  <burny> it was an exact tie, till he attacked the 8s
2010-11-30T21:16:44  <burny> and if I sniped the one: woulda meant he spent 16, and grew 15
2010-11-30T21:16:56  <burny> prioer to when we each owned 1
2010-11-30T21:17:12  <burny> my bot woulda ideally sniped the other 8 also: but it wouldn't have been able to hold it
2010-11-30T21:18:01  <eburnette> at turn 7 he attacked the bottom 8 which would put him ahead
2010-11-30T21:18:19  <burny> he spent 8 to take it though
2010-11-30T21:18:22  <burny> I woulda spent 0

2010-11-30T21:20:47  <burny> ya, true.. 1 turn
2010-11-30T21:21:10  <burny> still though.. 5ships, for nothing
2010-11-30T21:22:49  <eburnette> 3 maybe
2010-11-30T21:23:12  <eburnette> minus lost opportunity
2010-11-30T21:24:02  <burny> 1 turn: he could counter it from his main base, the next turn(resnipe)
2010-11-30T21:25:01  <burny> actually, it woulda given me a 7ship advantage, not 1.. those planets were only 3grow
2010-11-30T21:25:14  <burny> so he spent 8ships to gain 3grow
2010-11-30T21:25:33  <burny> he woulda won anyway though, I'm sure..
2010-11-30T21:26:20  <burny> but the whole, leaving my base undefended thing, is the cause of about half my losses

2010-11-30T22:49:56  <rebelxt_> why are we getting these draw maps? my bots is optimized for fast expansion, but it will lose to you on "normal" maps
2010-11-30T22:51:41  <antimatroid> draw maps are unavoidable

2010-11-30T23:12:23  <antimatroid> i wouldn't mind my bot jumping up a couple of places

2010-11-30T23:13:54  <antimatroid> i would love to see someone implement a minimax tree with them as the returning player and trying to exploit minimax
2010-11-30T23:14:07  <antimatroid> i think it'd be more likely to show sucess with something like tron though

2010-11-30T23:14:34  <antimatroid> ouch
2010-11-30T23:14:42  <antimatroid> i peaked in the 20s i think
2010-11-30T23:14:50  <antimatroid> and haven't really dropped back to 40 since going above
2010-11-30T23:14:51  <burny> I wonder how well this bot would work against top ranked bots..
2010-11-30T23:15:05  <burny> figure out the best move you can make, and the best counter to it, etc.. with minimax..
2010-11-30T23:15:14  <antimatroid> i've stopped thinking about this problem and moved onto things i've been neglecting
2010-11-30T23:15:19  <burny> and then for your move: play the opponents counter-move
2010-11-30T23:15:33  <antimatroid> i'm not going to try and crank an arimaa bot out in a month either, i think i might take a year and try to throw a good one together
