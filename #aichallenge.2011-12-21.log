2011-12-21T00:00:12  <ChrisH_> yeah, don't think i remember his bot doing that before
2011-12-21T00:00:44  <ChrisH_> i think i'm paying the price for not getting many early games, my catch up games are all filled with tough opponents
2011-12-21T00:01:00  <ChrisH_> but still, my bot is not living up to expectations so far
2011-12-21T00:01:09  <BenJackson> ...and panela
2011-12-21T00:01:13  <BenJackson> who the hell is that
2011-12-21T00:01:25  <antimatroid> ChrisH: :( on that first part
2011-12-21T00:01:40  <antimatroid> my bot seems to have done okay there, hopefully it evens out eventually
2011-12-21T00:02:23  <ChrisH_> I don't know who panela is, but he sent more ants my way early and that bottle me up as well
2011-12-21T00:02:41  <BenJackson> strcat can be a verrry bad neighbor like that too

2011-12-21T00:05:20  <BenJackson> how about this as a refinement to ants:
2011-12-21T00:05:25  <praveen__> admin, when is the cut off?
2011-12-21T00:05:32  <BenJackson> when you are in combat+2 radius of an enemy you can exchange data
2011-12-21T00:05:41  <Scryer> anti: takes a while to figure out how good a starter bot is compared to other starter bots.
2011-12-21T00:05:52  <BenJackson> say 1 bit per ant, based on whichever side has the fewest ants
2011-12-21T00:06:22  <BenJackson> or maybe it's not one bit but values from a small enum
2011-12-21T00:06:43  <Scryer> You can do that with a special handshake dance, can't you, BJ?
2011-12-21T00:06:46  <ChrisH_> praveen__: it hasn't been announced yet
2011-12-21T00:07:23  <ChrisH_> Scryer: that seems like it would be a waste of turns
2011-12-21T00:07:24  <BenJackson> Scryer: yes, but in a tight space it's not practical, and might expose you to attack
2011-12-21T00:07:34  <BenJackson> maybe if enemies could see you swap places
2011-12-21T00:07:36  <BenJackson> but they can't

2011-12-21T00:07:58  <Scryer> Depends - if your alliance proposal is accepted you might both end up ahead.
2011-12-21T00:08:04  <BenJackson> anyway maybe if ants get together over the course of a few turns they could negotiate something like "cease hostilities here for 20 turns"
2011-12-21T00:08:10  <ChrisH_> praveen__: where are you now?
2011-12-21T00:08:22  <praveen__> 413

2011-12-21T00:08:36  <ChrisH_> praveen__: whatever the first cut is you will make it
2011-12-21T00:09:04  <praveen__> ChrisH: Ya I understand that. still I feel its getting late
2011-12-21T00:09:08  <BenJackson> unless you're 1000 places below where you were before you're probably just fine
2011-12-21T00:09:13  <ChrisH_> i think they only plan to cut less than the bottom half off
2011-12-21T00:09:17  <BenJackson> praveen__: no no it's super early
2011-12-21T00:09:38  <ChrisH_> praveen__: games will come faster once the cuts start happening, so "time" will accellerate
2011-12-21T00:09:39  <Scryer> I was at about 80 the last time I got a game, 11h 22m ago, but have been gradually sliding to (now) 152.
2011-12-21T00:10:05  <praveen__> BenJackson: Yes I agree
2011-12-21T00:10:32  <BenJackson> oop, xathis jumped me
2011-12-21T00:10:35  <BenJackson> he must have gotten a game

2011-12-21T00:43:34  <BenJackson> xyxan: they started prioritizing people with few games
2011-12-21T00:43:38  <ChrisH_> xyxan: with the change in scheduling to work through all the lowest game count bots first, that counter now behaves different
2011-12-21T00:43:40  <xyxan> 15 :P
2011-12-21T00:44:03  <ChrisH_> xyxan: so it won't go down much until all the bots with fewer games than you have caught up
2011-12-21T00:44:58  <ChrisH_> xyxan: and once it starts going down a little faster that means you could get a game at any moment because it doesn't do a good job of knowing where you are within the group with the same number of games as yu
2011-12-21T00:45:02  <xyxan> ahan right :)   but guyz there must be some change in game settings like viewradius & attackradius

2011-12-21T00:49:49  <xyxan> yeah people with fewer games must be given priority

2011-12-21T00:51:23  <xyxan> in my opinion, starter botz must not participate in final tournament

2011-12-21T00:53:30  <Kettling> I'm still just hanging in the top 1000, probably won't make top 800 ... there's definitely a bug where it doesn't grab holes even when it has the chance, especially if a food pops up near the hole to distract the ant. I didn't get the tuning quite right on that one.
2011-12-21T00:53:47  <xyxan> janzert: increase view and attack radius :D
2011-12-21T00:54:36  <Kettling> That's bitten me about 5 times where they dawdled around not grabbing holes, and probably that's at least one "skills" point right there

2011-12-21T01:11:10  <xyxan> cutoff around 500 :O It should be 1000 :(
2011-12-21T01:11:12  <Zaphus> the new scheduling seems to be working well (at least for those who were behind... probably doesnt feel as good for xyxan )
2011-12-21T01:11:34  <Scryer> Pretty sure that means the final cutoff, xyxan, not the initial cutoff.

2011-12-21T01:12:11  <Scryer> The starter bots are somewhere around 2-3000, I think.
2011-12-21T01:12:17  <janzert> yes, that is the farthest I expect it to go
2011-12-21T01:12:42  <Zaphus> greedybot is at 2080 or so, that might be your marker
2011-12-21T01:13:10  <xyxan> yeah :D
2011-12-21T01:13:38  <ChrisH_> we're down to 586 bots with 11 games
2011-12-21T01:16:38  <Scryer> ChrisH: do you also know the max?  I saw one in the 40s as I was glancing around by hand.
2011-12-21T01:17:14  <ChrisH_> McLeopold did a query earlier that showed a bot with 66 games
2011-12-21T01:17:22  <ChrisH_> that was the max
2011-12-21T01:17:34  <Scryer> Ah.  Thanks.

2011-12-21T01:18:40  <ChrisH_> yeah, I think it's a starter bot, the ultimate weed out test bot
2011-12-21T01:18:48  <Scryer> Thanks, janzert.  Looks like the bottom is clumping pretty well.

2011-12-21T01:42:55  <xyxan> a1kon but i still agree with you about changing combat radius & view radius
2011-12-21T01:43:10  <a1k0n> my bot would cope with that just fine :)
2011-12-21T01:44:18  <xyxan> haha i have another idea :P @janzert   what about map with no water :D
2011-12-21T01:44:26  <a1k0n> boring
2011-12-21T01:44:47  <xyxan> an open battle ground will be a good measure :D
2011-12-21T01:45:05  <BenJackson> wow that was a nice battle in my last game

2011-12-21T01:53:06  <erdman> is that to be expcted with the landmarking thing?
2011-12-21T01:53:07  <xyxan> really strange
2011-12-21T01:53:10  <ChrisH_> I believe McLeopold said he thinks there is still a race condiditon in the scheduler somewhere, and that profile seems to be evidence of that
2011-12-21T01:53:35  <erdman> ok, good, i'm glad it's viewed as a problem
2011-12-21T01:53:38  <ChrisH_> erdman: no, i think that has more to do with a bug in the timing of when matches are created and when the bot gets removed from the queue
2011-12-21T01:54:35  <erdman> chrish: thanks, jsut wanted to make sure u guys are aware
2011-12-21T01:54:50  <ChrisH_> janzert, McLeopold here is another profile that shows a possible race condidtion in scheduling: http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=2321
2011-12-21T01:55:15  <ChrisH_> thanks erdman
2011-12-21T01:58:16  <janzert> Yes, that should be avoided by the change to stop the worker request from generating a matchup and instead make it wait for one to become available
2011-12-21T01:58:28  <janzert> that change was made earlier today
2011-12-21T01:59:48  <Kettling> I got a row of games on the same map and I thought it was a helpful feature. Very interesting comparison to see different opponents on the same map.

2011-12-21T02:38:22  <ChrisH_> and the hill at 115, 64 is never really threatened so it spawns fewer ants for most of the game
2011-12-21T02:39:16  <ChrisH_> the hill at 138, 0 seems to spawn a lot of ants that help defend ant then take several nearby hills
2011-12-21T02:39:41  <ChrisH_> that's what I saw anyway
2011-12-21T02:40:05  <BenJackson> from forum:> One of my friends who essentially used the starter bot and just added pathfinding (for each pair of ants-food like in the tutorial) and timeout handling and no more sophisticated stuff is around rank 1500 already.
2011-12-21T02:40:13  <BenJackson> that's better than greedy I think
2011-12-21T02:40:20  <BenJackson> of course greedy was timing out like crazy in the finals

2011-12-21T02:50:03  <ChrisH_> I just posted the first installment of my bot description on the forums. Mostly a high level overview, but its a start.
2011-12-21T02:51:49  <antimatroid> xathis is in place
2011-12-21T02:52:16  <BenJackson> I was playing skyrim when I jumped him briefly :(
2011-12-21T02:52:39  <BenJackson> even though it will make no ultimate difference it's entertaining riding out this phase in 1st/2nd rather than, you know, 85th or something
2011-12-21T02:53:07  <antimatroid> BenJackson: you probably get a small advantage actually :)
2011-12-21T02:53:41  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: you need to correct the typo of "note a starter bot" in your post
2011-12-21T02:53:46  <BenJackson> I am expecting a phse where all my games are vs flag and xathis and lazarant where I'm whipped down a few notches
2011-12-21T02:54:04  <BenJackson> followed by a period where I beat on some top 20-30 bots as my sigma drops
2011-12-21T02:54:28  <antimatroid> my bot dropped lots in rank recently :(
2011-12-21T02:54:53  <BenJackson> ChrisH_: danke

2011-12-21T02:56:51  <ChrisH_> so, as i said a bit ago, i have posted an overview of my bot: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=2202  I would love to hear comments on style or organization, etc. so I can adjust as I add more.
2011-12-21T02:57:01  <BenJackson> reading it now
2011-12-21T02:57:23  <BenJackson> I was pondering how Dijkstra w/cost was different from bfs w/cost in this case
2011-12-21T02:57:27  <BenJackson> but I assume you will elucidate
2011-12-21T02:58:01  <Ashoka> antimatroid : you deserved little more than 2 points in that game. u survived till end and had a decent army as well... may be your bot should be taking few risks and attack more.
2011-12-21T02:58:17  <thestinger> BenJackson: I don't think a BFS with costs is a BFS anymore
2011-12-21T02:58:21  <ChrisH_> BenJackson: they are the same AFAIK

2011-12-21T02:58:53  <BenJackson> I guess with costs the bfs revisits squares, dijkstra would not
2011-12-21T02:59:30  <Ashoka> @rankings
2011-12-21T02:59:37  <contestbot> Ashoka: Top 10 players: xathis(82.5), BenJackson(81.7), meduza(81.4), FlagCapper(81.4), delineate(80.0), runevision(79.8), lazarant(79.8), _Atsky_(79.6), teapotahedron(79.6), Speedy_Consoles(79.4)
2011-12-21T02:59:57  <ChrisH_> dijkstra's does not revisit, i've always thought of dijkstra's as a BFS that allows for possitive weights other than 1
2011-12-21T03:00:05  <Westicles> Just curious, how many games do you think top bots will have when this is over/
2011-12-21T03:00:19  <BenJackson> one of the organizers said 200ish
2011-12-21T03:00:27  <BenJackson> but they've also said the 22nd which seems incompatible with that
2011-12-21T03:00:51  <Westicles> BenJackson:  Thanks.  Any reason why it should be a few thousand?
2011-12-21T03:00:57  <Westicles> shouldn't
2011-12-21T03:01:06  <BenJackson> time? money?
2011-12-21T03:01:22  <BenJackson> janzert was talking about a final cutoff around 500
2011-12-21T03:01:41  <BenJackson> even assuming 5p games average 100,000 games is a lot on the scale of the contest
2011-12-21T03:01:48  <Westicles> Oh.  I was thinking tighter cutoffs
2011-12-21T03:01:54  <BenJackson> only 300,000 have been played total so far

2011-12-21T03:02:48  <BenJackson> although really these things need to be decided well in advance to avoid changing the outcome by late decision

2011-12-21T03:04:16  <janzert> 200 was a hoped for guess that will probably not play out now that the rate we can play games is so much lower than expected
2011-12-21T03:04:46  <BenJackson> so the time cutoff is fixed?
2011-12-21T03:04:53  <janzert> there are problems with making the cutoff too tight so 250 is basically it
2011-12-21T03:05:06  <janzert> the end of competition isn't a hard fix so may be pushed out some
2011-12-21T03:05:15  <janzert> there has been a bit of talk about doing that
2011-12-21T03:05:43  <janzert> but probably only a day
2011-12-21T03:06:31  <BenJackson> should the "it only takes 5 minutes to submit..." paragraph be removed from the front page?
2011-12-21T03:06:47  <xyxan> lol ^
2011-12-21T03:07:09  <janzert> probably :)
2011-12-21T03:07:40  <janzert> well, I don't know
2011-12-21T03:07:57  <BenJackson> the ai-class book market is softening up
2011-12-21T03:07:59  <janzert> anyway the big heading at the top should tip you off I think

2011-12-21T03:08:32  <matthewd> janzert: At this point, the game rate is purely a function of CPU power/time, right? Nothing that can be helped with?
2011-12-21T03:08:57  <BenJackson> or the matchmaker
2011-12-21T03:09:18  <BenJackson> janzert: add a web form to suggest matchups.  that will keep things going
2011-12-21T03:09:58  <janzert> the game rate is limited by the database performance actually

2011-12-21T03:11:24  <matthewd> Is there scope to help with that? Is it review-query-to-try-to-improve slow, or just hardware-limitation slow?

2011-12-21T04:35:55  <janzert> probably soon though

2011-12-21T04:37:34  <Surya> Janzert: oh ok nice :)
2011-12-21T04:37:46  <janzert> you mean 30

2011-12-21T04:39:24  <xyxan> :)
2011-12-21T04:39:32  <Surya> Janzert : How many bots are you going to cutoff btw? (just an approximation)
2011-12-21T04:39:58  <janzert> it will initially go to 5000 over a period of a few hours
2011-12-21T04:40:16  <Surya> Ok, nice. Thx for those info
2011-12-21T04:40:21  <janzert> well maybe quicker for this first one
2011-12-21T04:40:35  <janzert> but 5000 is the first stopping point in any case
2011-12-21T04:43:21  <flowenol> janzert: soon?
2011-12-21T04:43:43  <janzert> after everyone has 13 games and I do a few checks
2011-12-21T04:43:55  <flowenol> any estimated time?
2011-12-21T04:44:05  <flowenol> (sorry for being annoying but im way too stressed)
2011-12-21T04:44:11  <janzert> probably an hour

2011-12-21T04:45:35  <flowenol> ahÂ´
2011-12-21T04:45:37  <janzert> no comment on being annoying :P
2011-12-21T04:45:37  <flowenol> i know that
2011-12-21T04:45:54  <flowenol> but the faster the cutoff, the faster my bot will play more
2011-12-21T04:45:59  <flowenol> so the more it may rise
2011-12-21T04:46:14  <flowenol> and im expecting it to go up a decent value in skill
2011-12-21T04:46:44  <janzert> don't expect it to translate into ranks though
2011-12-21T04:47:02  <flowenol> will translate into country rank
2011-12-21T04:47:04  <flowenol> hopefully
2011-12-21T04:47:05  <janzert> since everyone around you is likely to have there skill going up as well
2011-12-21T04:47:29  <flowenol> since i had a nice advantage over the second one in my country
2011-12-21T04:47:38  <janzert> ahh, that looks to be close for you :)
2011-12-21T04:47:55  <flowenol> i gave up on top 100 a long time ago
2011-12-21T04:48:05  <flowenol> first in my country will suffice
2011-12-21T04:48:20  <flowenol> i was there before the cmpetition started so i have hope
2011-12-21T04:49:14  <janzert> :)
2011-12-21T04:50:15  <flowenol> ah just do the cutoff
2011-12-21T04:50:25  * flowenol is beconing insane with this
2011-12-21T04:50:41  <xyxan> lol
2011-12-21T04:51:07  <xyxan> cutoff is not as important as change of viewradius & attackradius :D
2011-12-21T04:51:14  <flowenol> im too addicted to this
2011-12-21T04:51:26  <flowenol> xyxan: mine are not hardcoded
2011-12-21T04:51:30  <flowenol> my bot should be fine
2011-12-21T04:51:40  <Accoun> http://tcpants.com/player/Accoun12301 let play
2011-12-21T04:51:45  <xyxan> lots of botz will have poor performance
2011-12-21T04:52:10  <xyxan> flowenol :) mine is also not hardcoded
2011-12-21T04:52:25  <flowenol> it may have a little lower performance on combat
2011-12-21T04:52:35  <flowenol> if attackradius goes up
2011-12-21T04:52:41  <flowenol> depends on how much
2011-12-21T04:53:29  <flowenol> xyxan: some friends made some of those hardcoded, they may have some trouble
2011-12-21T04:53:33  <xyxan> attackradius2 = 7 & viewradius2 = 99 :)
2011-12-21T04:53:44  <xyxan> ^ will be a good choice
2011-12-21T04:54:30  <flowenol> not a big change
2011-12-21T04:54:38  <xyxan> attackradius2 = 9 & viewradius2 = 99 :)
2011-12-21T04:54:50  <xyxan> 9 will be gud :D
2011-12-21T04:54:53  <flowenol> now that may affect my performance a little
2011-12-21T04:55:01  <flowenol> but lets see
2011-12-21T04:55:11  <flowenol> im not too worried with that
2011-12-21T04:55:19  <Surya> I'd rather not see a change in those parameters :)
2011-12-21T04:55:22  <xyxan> not even me :)
2011-12-21T04:55:28  <Surya> My bot would go crazy ><
2011-12-21T04:55:42  <flowenol> Surya: why
2011-12-21T04:56:29  <Surya> Because my fighting method has been made up at the end, And I use attackRadius + some hardcoded position. Needless to say I'm not so proud of it.
2011-12-21T04:56:48  <xyxan> also i would suggest adding maps with no water :D <<< that will make many botz CRAZY :)
2011-12-21T04:57:00  <xyxan> janzert ^ ^

2011-12-21T04:57:50  <flowenol> now that i think about it, larger view radius may be better for me
2011-12-21T04:58:07  <xyxan> i dont think so :) there is very less probability of change in parameters
2011-12-21T04:58:46  <xyxan> waht if viewradius = attackradius :D
2011-12-21T04:59:14  <Surya> Ok, that's what I saw on the forum. Next challenge I won't make the mistake though
2011-12-21T04:59:16  <xyxan> everything will go crazy :D

2011-12-21T05:03:05  <janzert> at this point no more maps will be added, no game setting changes will be made

2011-12-21T05:24:32  <Surya> I got a question for you Janzert (yeah, again) : Were those finals prepared accurately and we're exactly where we're supposed to be. Or have those decisions been taken on the way. (The secret goal of my question is to know if you're confident about the Thursday deadline ;))

2011-12-21T05:32:00  <janzert> some of the former some of the latter :)
2011-12-21T05:33:22  <flowenol> and anoher timeout
2011-12-21T05:33:25  <flowenol> wtf
2011-12-21T05:33:46  <flowenol> time to test it
2011-12-21T05:34:05  <Surya> TL__ 5k to cutoff apparently
2011-12-21T05:34:08  <flowenol> this is not normal
2011-12-21T05:35:21  <tob__k> so the 5k bots with the lowest mu will be cutoff... an do you already know when? just interested...

2011-12-21T05:36:59  <tob__k> excuse me, but I read in the forum that the cutoff will be determined by mu, while the rank is determined by the skill (mu-3*sigma)

2011-12-21T05:37:39  <tob__k> okay.

2011-12-21T05:38:21  <tob__k> (I think, the idea was to use mu so that bots with a low number of games are not at a disadvantage)

2011-12-21T05:48:03  <codetiger> if greedy is fixed to avoid timeout, it should land in within 2000
2011-12-21T05:48:19  <katebus> better defensive and adjust later if needed, we will se how it will influence the contest

2011-12-21T05:50:50  <tob__k> maybe provide test bots only in binary and require source files to be submitted?
2011-12-21T05:51:24  <xyxan> people will still submit starter codes :D

2011-12-21T05:51:51  <tob__k> greedy bot?
2011-12-21T05:51:57  <Fluxid> and greedy bot was uploaded with aggreement of organizers
2011-12-21T05:52:17  <tob__k> oh, okay. :-)
2011-12-21T05:52:40  <katebus> well it is good that we have a few sample bots to compare to (lets say from 1 to 4)
2011-12-21T05:53:02  <codetiger> it gives us a rank comparison for cutoff as well
2011-12-21T05:53:32  <mayanks43> no more bot uploads allowed now right?
2011-12-21T05:54:27  <mayanks43> oh yeah
2011-12-21T05:54:32  <mayanks43> sry for tht
2011-12-21T05:54:48  <katebus> @codetiger, yes games around 3500 looks funny -> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=302685&user=13614
2011-12-21T05:54:49  <contestbot> katebus: Run as fast as you can and don't look back.
2011-12-21T05:54:52  <tob__k> my impression was that 50% or more of the submissions are starter bots (but no test bots i have to admit)... maybe next year one could change the tutorial not to encourage people to submit their starter bot as the first step, before even trying any improvements.
2011-12-21T05:55:00  <codetiger> My bot has a very good wining % in multihill close neighbor maps... what percentage of maps/games are usually in that range
2011-12-21T05:55:05  <Fluxid> 6% cut off
2011-12-21T05:55:59  <katebus> games around 3500 looks funny -> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=302685&user=13614
2011-12-21T05:56:01  <Fluxid> katebus: this way a bot which starts to do something lost because of timeout...
2011-12-21T05:56:10  <flowenol> janzert:  where can we see how many cutoffs

2011-12-21T05:56:30  <codetiger> I fixed a bug to make my bot perform better in close neighbor maps, and now it works well only in that maps. Random maze has become a hell for my bot now
2011-12-21T05:56:46  <flowenol> Fluxid: pairint cutoff?
2011-12-21T05:56:53  <Fluxid> i think so

2011-12-21T06:01:25  <tob__k> another suggestion for the future: maybe one could provide a simple logging feature for the starter bot, since status information can not simply be put to console. first thing I did to my bot both last year and this year was to write a simple file logger. without something like this its impossible to debug the bot and many players will quit in frustration, leaving only their starter bot to play...

2011-12-21T06:10:25  <Fluxid> as far i understand, bots with rank up to $PAIRING_CUTOFF will continue to play
2011-12-21T06:10:51  <katebus> I understand it the same as fluxid

2011-12-21T06:12:40  <janzert> correct
2011-12-21T06:14:16  <codetiger> may be you should plan some other method for cutting off not average bots... Like in ants, food not gathering for 150 turns, that bot gets penalty
2011-12-21T06:15:40  <janzert> it's a form of elimination tournament, slowly the less performant bots are eliminated
2011-12-21T06:16:45  <codetiger> Anyway, am happy it works now... Just that I've to wait
2011-12-21T06:17:44  <codetiger> haha... Rank 12 if you sort the first page in ascending number of games. Let me see how long my bot holds this postion
2011-12-21T06:18:14  <katebus> hmm I wonder (just wonder) how it influences the last games of the weak bots on the border of cutoff rule, these will be paired with stronger as you cannot find weaker
2011-12-21T06:19:03  <katebus> anyway for these week bots, it just the luck that counts
2011-12-21T06:19:35  <codetiger> Anyway, losing to a strong opponent doesn't reduce your skill much
2011-12-21T06:19:51  <katebus> sure
2011-12-21T06:21:14  <katebus> ane the cuott goes so fast through the list that it will not matter for these weaker bots
2011-12-21T06:21:22  <janzert> relevant to that; the cutoff is soft in that a bot can get pushed below it from losing a game allowing a different one to pop back above the cutoff and take its place
2011-12-21T06:21:39  <codetiger> Does the matching, tries to keep number of games equal? atleast everytime before cutoff increases?
2011-12-21T06:21:43  <janzert> only really happening while the cutoff is stationary of course
2011-12-21T06:22:38  <janzert> codetiger: pretty much, so bots that pop back above may get a few games quickly
2011-12-21T06:23:05  <janzert> you'll see quite a bit of churn around the cutoff
2011-12-21T06:23:26  <flowenol> how long will the cutoff be kept fixed
2011-12-21T06:23:29  <codetiger> janzert: Good effort :) Thanks for all this sleepless nights

2011-12-21T06:24:00  <flowenol> kk
2011-12-21T06:24:08  <janzert> I don't expect it to stay at 5000 for too long, maybe a few rounds of games
2011-12-21T06:24:11  <mcstar> i need moar games, othwewise my bot wont rise to its proper palace :(
2011-12-21T06:24:23  <flowenol> i would kill to see how my bot ends
2011-12-21T06:24:27  <janzert> then probably 3000ish will be the next stop
2011-12-21T06:24:39  <flowenol> im still ok with that
2011-12-21T06:24:57  <flowenol> i will only be worried with cuts above 1000
2011-12-21T06:25:19  <mcstar> was there a cut already?
2011-12-21T06:25:31  <janzert> it'll be a while before it gets there :)
2011-12-21T06:25:45  <janzert> mcstar: in progress yes
2011-12-21T06:25:53  <mcstar> fantastic

2011-12-21T06:27:29  <mcstar> recent games in what time?
2011-12-21T06:27:29  <matthewd> janzert: On an unrelated note, I wonder, is it actually a weakness of TrueSkill that it tries to compensate for abilities changing over time, where that's not really the case with bots?
2011-12-21T06:28:13  <matthewd> mcstar: Games in the last 24 hours, I think

2011-12-21T06:34:14  <Zaphus> I see the cutoff has begun. Good system, gives everyone a chance initially (regardless of being a starterbot or not) and now it starts locking down

2011-12-21T07:32:07  <pairofdice> How many bots in the finals atm?
2011-12-21T07:32:53  <pairofdice> ~5000?
2011-12-21T07:33:14  <Migi32> http://aichallenge.org/server_stats.php <- wow do we really have that many servers?
2011-12-21T07:33:17  <mcstar> ~7900 but the cutoff is at 5k
2011-12-21T07:33:41  <mcstar> Migi32: but the figures are pretty big
2011-12-21T07:33:55  <mcstar> id like to see them down to 1
2011-12-21T07:33:59  <mcstar> or something
2011-12-21T07:34:16  <mcstar> there were times when i could play almost hourly
2011-12-21T07:34:28  <mcstar> why cant this be the case in the finals :(

2011-12-21T07:34:50  <mcstar> (it is rethorical, dont answer that)
2011-12-21T07:35:07  <Zaphus> there were only ~750 active bots near the end, then we went to 7500 active :-)

2011-12-21T07:36:46  <cseyu01> Next Game: 1,267,973 players are ahead.
2011-12-21T07:36:48  <Migi32> how much has this cutoff really saved, though? I mean, starter bots (or most weak bots) don't use any CPU whatsoever, and games between starter bots probably take only a few seconds
2011-12-21T07:37:07  <sdsd> There was a cutoff?
2011-12-21T07:37:12  <mcstar> thats why we want to see smaller cutoff
2011-12-21T07:37:53  <cseyu01> Next game should be before the end of the universe as we know it....maybe
2011-12-21T07:37:53  <pairofdice> And it will get smaller
2011-12-21T07:37:59  <Zaphus> migi32: I assume the cutoff will move some more, once everyone in the 5000 has had a game or three, and it will keep doing that until ~500 are left (I'm inventing the numbers)
2011-12-21T07:38:13  <janzert> remember the limit on games rate now isn't time to play the game it's database load inserting it and create pairings
2011-12-21T07:38:31  <mcstar> o.O
2011-12-21T07:38:33  <mcstar> O.o
2011-12-21T07:38:36  <janzert> as game length increases I can just add more workers so the same number are finishing games at a time
2011-12-21T07:38:37  <Zaphus> janzert: That's sad :-)
2011-12-21T07:38:46  <janzert> in fact that is exactly what has been happening
2011-12-21T07:38:48  <cseyu01> quicksort not quick enough imo

2011-12-21T07:39:42  <pairofdice> hahha
2011-12-21T07:40:29  <mcstar> so the database isnt distributed?
2011-12-21T07:40:59  <janzert> no, it's mysql with myisam tables :( :( :(
2011-12-21T07:41:56  <Migi32> I can understand it a little bit though, the matchmaking query is a pretty beastly thing :)
2011-12-21T07:42:32  <tomb___> Zaphus: i had the same contest idea yesterday. i think i offended people with it.
2011-12-21T07:43:18  <tomb___> it is a joke, but that was lost :(

2011-12-21T07:45:22  <Zaphus> honestly I think the problem has been with the lack of communication to the participants, the guys doing all the hard work on the back end are under the pump, and nobody was talking to the masses.  and we all see it through our own little view (i.e. what's happening to your bot)
2011-12-21T07:45:55  <mcstar> theres a need for a Communications Officer
2011-12-21T07:45:58  <Migi32> hey, it says I'm "Playing in a game right now" :D
2011-12-21T07:45:58  <tomb___> Zaphus: i agree. i think they need someone to volunteer to do public relations
2011-12-21T07:45:59  <Zaphus> next time they need a spokesperson (like ChrisH stepped in at the end)
2011-12-21T07:46:15  <Migi32> I have 17 games though, so I don't really see why I'm allowed to play already
2011-12-21T07:46:18  <Migi32> but I don't mind :D
2011-12-21T07:46:49  <tomb___> i have had zero involvement with the administration of this contest, but i would be willing to help out on communications/public relations next time
2011-12-21T07:47:04  <mcstar> id like to contribute code or something
2011-12-21T07:47:09  <janzert> yeah, even just a volunteer with good communications skills like ChrisH did to relay things from IRC to the forums would be great

2011-12-21T07:47:39  <pairofdice> Was I supposed to say "...and my axe!"?
2011-12-21T07:47:40  <Zaphus> yeah, I was thinking the same (about helping on comms) - it probably needs 2 or 3 people, given the 24hr timezones it runs in
2011-12-21T07:48:05  <janzert> the forums though at this stage of the contest are approached with much dread and take quite an effort to write a post :/
2011-12-21T07:48:07  <mcstar> i helped a lot earlier though
2011-12-21T07:48:09  <tomb___> if the contest has any legal issues in the U.S., I may be able to help with those
2011-12-21T07:48:13  <Zaphus> janzert: yes, that worked well with ChrisH
2011-12-21T07:48:18  <mcstar> i mean i spent too much time with these things here
2011-12-21T07:48:29  <Migi32> how about a blog? Whenever there are issues or decisions you've made, put that on that blog.
2011-12-21T07:48:51  <janzert> a blog wouldn't be much better for me than the forums really

2011-12-21T07:49:33  <janzert> since anything formal is going to take me a half hour minimum working over the wording to try and be accurate yet not picked apart to death :}

2011-12-21T07:51:47  <Zaphus> problem with IRC is that if you weren't there the minute the thing was said, you miss it (more or less)
2011-12-21T07:52:12  <mcstar> we need a @sticky
2011-12-21T07:52:13  <pairofdice> Yeah, but it gives you a better sense of .... concurrency

2011-12-21T07:52:56  <Zaphus> best solution is that IRC is where the decisions get made, then someone translates that into a forum post (sticky, perhaps no replies in some cases)
2011-12-21T07:53:35  <mcstar> what happened to RSS feeds?
2011-12-21T07:53:45  <Migi32> yeah, I agree. But I'm not sure that so many people read the forum announcements
2011-12-21T07:53:45  <mcstar> they were in fashion for a while
2011-12-21T07:53:49  <mcstar> and they disapperaed
2011-12-21T07:53:50  <janzert> yes, the way ChrisH was able to relay some things really is ideal from my perspective more of that by him and or others would be great
2011-12-21T07:53:55  <mcstar> were they really useless?

2011-12-21T07:55:37  <Zaphus> janzert: would we be expecting the game time per server to be increasing as we reduce the list, and the failure rate to be decreasing ?
2011-12-21T07:55:42  <mcstar> and a bundled news-reader

2011-12-21T07:58:01  <Zaphus> mcstar: yes, lower will be better, but I imagine the bots will be the ones that use more of their allotted time, and live longer (than the ones being cut off) - so games will take longer

2011-12-21T08:00:31  <janzert> the game time for the server calculation is just 30 / number of games in past half hour
2011-12-21T08:00:46  <janzert> so yeah all overhead is in it
2011-12-21T08:01:07  <mcstar> then i expect numbers to get even lower with time

2011-12-21T08:12:09  <janzert> ok, it's not a starter bot though
2011-12-21T08:14:49  <Surya> janzert : ok, what I mean is he copied paster the code from the website (the 5 tutos)
2011-12-21T08:14:59  <Surya> and just uploaded it. My bad
2011-12-21T08:15:06  <janzert> ahh, tutorial bot
2011-12-21T08:15:20  <janzert> a starter bot is much dumber :}
2011-12-21T08:15:21  <Surya> yep, my bad, I thought it was already inside the Java Starter pack.
2011-12-21T08:15:23  <Surya> ok :)
2011-12-21T08:15:46  <janzert> not that a tutorial bot is terribly smart :P
2011-12-21T08:16:09  <mcstar> thats the point
2011-12-21T08:16:13  <janzert> and python tutorial bots will time out continually
2011-12-21T08:16:14  <mcstar> it is ranked too high
2011-12-21T08:16:19  <cseyu01> with some small modifications the tutorial boit can be pretty strong
2011-12-21T08:16:37  <pairofdice> Keyword, modifications
2011-12-21T08:16:52  <janzert> mcstar: I'm not so sure it is
2011-12-21T08:16:54  <cseyu01> just have to get rid of "is_occupid" or whatever
2011-12-21T08:17:15  <cseyu01> better to always use passable and weed out collisions

2011-12-21T08:17:56  <mcstar> but thats bs obviiously
2011-12-21T08:18:21  <mcstar> so like 4.5k people submitted
2011-12-21T08:18:24  <janzert> there were 7200 user accounts, 4619 submissions in the finals
2011-12-21T08:18:43  <mcstar> but i recon, much of those were very simple constructions
2011-12-21T08:18:45  <janzert> I don't remember how many were starter bots if you wanted to weed them out as well ;)
2011-12-21T08:18:55  <mcstar> yes
2011-12-21T08:19:00  <mcstar> i wanted some approximation
2011-12-21T08:19:08  <mcstar> if the figures hold for this contest too
2011-12-21T08:19:14  <mcstar> to see if*
2011-12-21T08:19:57  <janzert> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9140666/elo-draw-chart.png
2011-12-21T08:20:09  <mcstar> because if a simple bot reaches 1700 from 7k bots, then id say, PW had 5-600 good contestants
2011-12-21T08:20:21  <janzert> where the big green bump of draw percentage is was all the starter bots

2011-12-21T08:22:09  <xyxan> :P so reduce cutoff to 2500 :D
2011-12-21T08:22:24  <mcstar> so the gap is at ~4000 as i thought
2011-12-21T08:22:35  <Ashoka> a1k0n: is your bot has a known weakness in 2 player maps.... ? my bot seems to be having a good time against your one at tcpants bit strange as the same bot is doing so poorly in the official server.
2011-12-21T08:22:41  <Surya> Maybe the tutorial shouldn't have contained code. just pseudo code.
2011-12-21T08:23:15  <mcstar> Surya: python is supposed to read like pseudocode :D
2011-12-21T08:23:41  <janzert> not to mention the python code given will just create a bot that times out in most games
2011-12-21T08:23:46  <sdsd> I like that there was code in the tutorial
2011-12-21T08:23:57  <Ashoka> a1kon: ah part of the reasoning may be in the tutorial map, my one seems to like it so much.
2011-12-21T08:24:00  <sdsd> Gives a decent idea
2011-12-21T08:24:02  <cseyu01> good to have code in the tutorial imo
2011-12-21T08:24:14  <cseyu01> <-- leant pythong for this
2011-12-21T08:24:15  <janzert> sdsd: yeah, I do think the tutorial was quite nice for people this time
2011-12-21T08:24:42  <xyxan> janzert :P can you give timing details for all bots :P whos is much efficient? and also in high rank??
2011-12-21T08:24:50  <cseyu01> i don't think i could've picked up python so fast without the code in teh tutorial
2011-12-21T08:25:05  <sdsd> ^same
2011-12-21T08:25:30  <mcstar> hm
2011-12-21T08:25:36  <mcstar> python is deeper than that though
2011-12-21T08:25:51  <cseyu01> ?
2011-12-21T08:25:57  <sdsd> Yea, but you've got to start somewhere
2011-12-21T08:26:39  <sdsd> Better some implemented working code then start from scratch in a language that's new for you, imo
2011-12-21T08:26:50  <janzert> xyxan: no that isn't recorded
2011-12-21T08:26:50  <mcstar> i dont agree sorry
2011-12-21T08:27:07  <mcstar> it nice when you figure out these things yourself
2011-12-21T08:27:13  <mcstar> of course if you have the time...
2011-12-21T08:27:15  <Surya> Ok, so it's needed. My problem is that I wish I could have a proper ranking at the end. Like "you ended up" X / Y "real contesters, not starter pack or tutorial copy paster if you know what I mean. But if it helped you a lot, I guess it was a good  thing :)

2011-12-21T09:14:45  <katebus> I am not fluxid but it is snowing right now here where I am
2011-12-21T09:14:52  <mcstar> for example: after only turn 10 or something
2011-12-21T09:15:01  <katebus> i dont know where Fluxid is
2011-12-21T09:15:08  <mcstar> he is polsih too
2011-12-21T09:15:22  <Fluxid> Poland, yeah, it snowed a little last night
2011-12-21T09:15:30  <Fluxid> mcstar: too?
2011-12-21T09:15:47  <Ashoka> meduza_: you deserve a pat on the back for being #2 even after 2 time outs :-)
2011-12-21T09:16:08  <mcstar> Fluxid: like katebus
2011-12-21T09:16:19  <mcstar> and its snowing here
2011-12-21T09:18:15  <mcstar> if(myants_list.size()<3){return;}
2011-12-21T09:18:23  <mcstar> thats the auxiliary condition
2011-12-21T09:18:39  <mcstar> <3 is not an emoticon
2011-12-21T09:19:17  <mcstar> this is some serious flaw
2011-12-21T09:19:25  <Ashoka> mcstar: In that game with Accoun where u have won, ur bot was sparing the last hill
2011-12-21T09:19:35  <meduza_> Ashoka: actually i don't think this two influenced my rating much ;) both times i was losing when it happened

2011-12-21T09:26:00  <travelan> hi
2011-12-21T09:26:12  <xyxan> i m getting games with 8 9 10 botz :(
2011-12-21T09:26:28  <mcstar> travelan: hi
2011-12-21T09:26:30  <pairofdice> And totaalnet servers aren't used in the finals afaik
2011-12-21T09:27:14  <Migi32> mcstar: I knew that my bot wasn't a top 20 bot before the finals even started. I was surprised that they were up there for a while anyway :)
2011-12-21T09:27:32  <mcstar> i imagined you there
2011-12-21T09:28:27  <Migi32> nope. If I had 2 more days, maybe. But I started writing the second version of my bot too late.
2011-12-21T09:29:42  <Migi32> I just hope to finish in the top 80. That means I'm the 1%! :D
2011-12-21T09:30:19  <mcstar> my iq puts me in the upper 2% so i'd be satisfied with that too
2011-12-21T09:30:33  <xyxan> i m 8% lol

2011-12-21T09:31:59  <UncleVasya> Ashoka: No timeout but in 1 or 2 games I've noticed that my bot have time only for battle and no time for strategy part.
2011-12-21T09:32:22  <UncleVasya> But I turn off battle resolution when 200ms left so it must have time.
2011-12-21T09:32:44  <mcstar> nice

2011-12-21T09:33:21  <Migi32> Ashoka: yup. When I first saw all the really good submissions coming in the few days before the deadline, I was a bit sad, cause I'd been like top 10 for ages. But then I realized just making it to the first page is pretty impressive.
2011-12-21T09:33:41  <mcstar> Ashoka: you are good at supply, probably that part i f'd up in the end
2011-12-21T09:33:51  <Ashoka> UncleVasya: Tx. I'm still worndering how my bot timed out at 44 ants when even a battle was not at hand.
2011-12-21T09:33:51  <mcstar> i run out of support ants
2011-12-21T09:35:55  <xyxan> what should be the next PairingCutOff?
2011-12-21T09:36:13  <Ashoka> UncleVasya: did we plan to play online Go  once? :-)
2011-12-21T09:36:40  <UncleVasya> Ashoka: I believe I've read on forums something like 'if servers are busy with other stuff there is a probability that your bot will not get its time'.
2011-12-21T09:37:11  <UncleVasya> Ashoka: I had a thought to ask same question :)
2011-12-21T09:37:39  <xyxan> I didnt handled timeouts in my code :P because my code even can handle 2000 ants at a time :D
2011-12-21T09:38:12  <UncleVasya> You were eashoka that time, right? Not a big change but what was your motivation for it?
2011-12-21T09:38:42  <TL_> 2 weeks before the finals I'm expecting to get into the top50, now I would be very happy if I could get into the top100.

2011-12-21T10:27:37  <mcstar> there must be something interesting there
2011-12-21T10:28:35  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you should nevertheless write an outline of what your bot does on the higher level
2011-12-21T10:28:41  <mcstar> besides documenting the code
2011-12-21T10:28:46  <a1k0n> yeah, i recommend installing jekyll and getting familiar with it.  it's somewhere between blog-generator and raw static html here-is-some-code kind of stuff
2011-12-21T10:29:00  <Murashka> I'm trying to write something like game report...like it was in VGA Planets long time ago :)

2011-12-21T10:36:26  <UncleVasya> As about any language:  I know every of them (c++, Delphi, OCaml) only on the level 'conditions, loops, functions, arrays or lists'
2011-12-21T10:36:44  <mcstar> did you write code in ocaml the way you would in c++?

2011-12-21T10:41:04  <mcstar> dont tell me ocaml doesnt have a fast sorting alg.

2011-12-21T10:43:07  <UncleVasya> I was lurking for sort function implementation before I decided to look at the standart libraries.

2011-12-21T10:44:34  <thestinger> I'm ending up in the middle (not first, but not last)
2011-12-21T10:44:54  <mcstar> do you think you gonna climb back?
2011-12-21T10:45:00  <thestinger> no

2011-12-21T10:45:45  <thestinger> maybe in the 20s if I get good games/starting positions

2011-12-21T10:46:53  <thestinger> mu has declined since then

2011-12-21T10:47:30  <thestinger> when all the top bots started passing me, so I got put in games with all of them a bunch of times xD

2011-12-21T11:00:33  <pguillory> heh np
2011-12-21T11:01:36  <tomb___> whoever was talking about bubblesort before.  i used a bubble sort in mine too.  i wrote it in c++, which has the stl sorting algorithms, but i dont use them very often and always forget the syntax
2011-12-21T11:01:49  <a1k0n> now i'm tempted to port my 2d infinite world engine to appengine with go (here btw: http://a1k0n.net/code/jscroll/b/ )
2011-12-21T11:02:05  <thestinger> tomb___: heh, I find insertion sort easier to code :P
2011-12-21T11:02:25  <tomb___> sometimes it is easier to just code it myself than figure out how the built-in feature works
2011-12-21T11:02:29  <thestinger> for bubble sort my brain has to turn on a bit
2011-12-21T11:02:38  <thestinger> sort(container.begin(), container.end()) :P
2011-12-21T11:02:44  <mcstar> :D
2011-12-21T11:02:46  <tomb___> ah, for some reason bubble sort is ingrained in my mind
2011-12-21T11:02:51  <onion42> good old STL
2011-12-21T11:03:00  <mcstar> i want to write merge sort
2011-12-21T11:03:06  <tomb___> i haven't coded anything in two years, but bubble sort is what i can remember
2011-12-21T11:03:16  <pguillory> a1k0n: that looks great
2011-12-21T11:03:19  <tomb___> two for loops
2011-12-21T11:04:00  <thestinger> mcstar: a simple merge sort that uses insertion sort for runs under 64 is faster than std::sort for me
2011-12-21T11:04:06  <jcdny> I wrote up my symmetry detection and put up a demo for anyone interested...
2011-12-21T11:04:12  <a1k0n> thanks.  i used to have a multiplayer version with enemies and stuff
2011-12-21T11:04:12  <jcdny> https://github.com/jcdny/bugnuts/wiki/Symmetry
2011-12-21T11:04:28  <codetiger> by the way is GO language comparable to c in performance, and not like python?
2011-12-21T11:04:37  <a1k0n> codetiger: yep
2011-12-21T11:04:41  <thestinger> mcstar: and running it with 2 threads makes it ~20% faster
2011-12-21T11:04:54  <mcstar> thestinger: i was very much surprised when it turned out the stl permutation is indeed very fast
2011-12-21T11:05:06  <mcstar> it beat my own alg

2011-12-21T11:05:34  <thestinger> Go is ~3x slower than C with 6g/6l
2011-12-21T11:05:41  <thestinger> 8g/8l are a bit worse
2011-12-21T11:05:56  <thestinger> gccgo is faster but then you can't really use goroutines because it uses a pthread for each of them
2011-12-21T11:06:09  <a1k0n> is l the linker or what?
2011-12-21T11:06:13  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-21T11:06:24  <thestinger> you can cross-compile really easily
2011-12-21T11:06:43  <thestinger> it essentially just converts Go -> assembly (barely any optimization)
2011-12-21T11:06:46  <codetiger> oh ok. I've a 10X10 map and my job is to find the unique path to remove all tiles in the map. I do a lot of recursion. With Python it took 10 hrs to solve a map. :(

2011-12-21T11:08:12  <thestinger> a1k0n: the standard compilers (8g, 8l, etc.) are based on the plan9 C compiler, and the goal is basically fast compilation time
2011-12-21T11:08:30  <thestinger> so performance is pretty disappointing for now because there isn't a mature llvm or gcc frontend
2011-12-21T11:08:52  <jcdny> thestinger: there are definitely some things where go is slower than C but I think its more like 50% slower not 3x.
2011-12-21T11:08:56  <a1k0n> ah.
2011-12-21T11:09:02  <mcstar> ah the famous plan9
2011-12-21T11:09:12  <mcstar> i love the bunny though

2011-12-21T11:10:33  <thestinger> I can't get goroutines to scale very well over multiple cores
2011-12-21T11:10:39  <mcstar> there are a bunch of weird named files in it
2011-12-21T11:11:13  <thestinger> jcdny: yeah, but the compilers don't inline at all
2011-12-21T11:11:15  <jcdny> then theres gc stuff and code generation which is admittedly weak relative to a heavily optimized compiler.
2011-12-21T11:11:25  <jcdny> inlining is coming soon.
2011-12-21T11:11:29  <thestinger> and interfaces are all virtual method calls

2011-12-21T11:13:02  <mcstar> but all the vars are floats

2011-12-21T11:24:18  <thestinger> but it has more ambition than just replacing C
2011-12-21T11:24:55  <jcdny> So to me a better C++ would include some sort of time machine to expression to go back and strangle Stroustrup in his crib

2011-12-21T11:25:13  <thestinger> well, Rust is very similar to Go
2011-12-21T11:25:24  <thestinger> same kind of concurrency as Go/Erlang
2011-12-21T11:25:42  <thestinger> utf8 strings, local type inference, memory safe

2011-12-21T11:26:25  <thestinger> and immutable data by default is a great choice to make for a modern language

2011-12-21T11:37:14  <mcstar> i totally agree

2011-12-21T12:11:18  <katebus> accoun how it is problem with servers
2011-12-21T12:11:26  <katebus> you have 500 ms limit
2011-12-21T12:11:33  <katebus> and i believe everyone is using that limit
2011-12-21T12:11:45  <Accoun> low memory or CPU speed
2011-12-21T12:11:54  <Accoun> Server #750 and Server #743 only ok all other give 5-13 % fail
2011-12-21T12:12:10  <katebus> so it is 3 minutes per user per cpu core
2011-12-21T12:12:24  <katebus> well, if the bot timeouts then it is fail
2011-12-21T12:12:31  <Accoun> it have 10 cores?
2011-12-21T12:12:32  <katebus> just look like GreedyBot always timeouts
2011-12-21T12:12:54  <katebus> there are many weak timeouting bots there
2011-12-21T12:12:56  <Fluxid> Accoun: somehow i timeouted only once, and xathis never.
2011-12-21T12:13:05  <katebus> and of course - sometimes there will be a server problem
2011-12-21T12:13:17  <katebus> I have never timeouted
2011-12-21T12:13:36  <katebus> I have check and 30 ms before limit I am out finishing the turn
2011-12-21T12:13:38  <Accoun> 9% with all bots and 99% with some bots
2011-12-21T12:13:50  * Fluxid gives up

2011-12-21T12:14:39  * janzert likes how 0 becomes 9%
2011-12-21T12:14:39  <katebus> ok, remember thath some garbage collected languages may have problem, when someone generates many objects per turn
2011-12-21T12:14:42  <katebus> like 500MB

2011-12-21T12:36:29  <a1k0n> mine was a fairly general solution but since coordination between ants is necessary it tends to suicide once in a while

2011-12-21T12:37:02  <dmj111> that is why I limited my participation time this time... I only want silver bullets now :)
2011-12-21T12:37:29  <a1k0n> working through the particulars of the attacking influence of each ant deterministically would have been a better approach

2011-12-21T12:37:50  <a1k0n> but it seems that efficient foraging is really what's important, as long as you have some semblance of combat and defense

2011-12-21T13:29:20  <jcdny> for multihill maps I have the correct symmetry typically before turn 10.
2011-12-21T13:29:49  <McLeopold> that would have really helped my combat
2011-12-21T13:30:33  <jcdny> parts of my symmetry code are reasonably elegant then there is a big slug of crap taco that I meant to clean up but didn't
2011-12-21T13:30:52  <a1k0n> that's very clever
2011-12-21T13:31:21  <jcdny> sadly I was appreciably less clever on my combat which is why I languish at 160th.
2011-12-21T13:31:40  <amstan_> what an odd number to timeout at in multiple matches: http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=2198
2011-12-21T13:32:36  <McLeopold> a1k0n: also, you can look for food spawned on the same turn
2011-12-21T13:32:59  <McLeopold> I was trying to use that to find possible enemy hill locations
2011-12-21T13:33:13  <a1k0n> right
2011-12-21T13:33:22  <McLeopold> but finding an example takes quite a few turns
2011-12-21T13:33:24  <jcdny> It does that.  Another thing is with symmetry you know food spawns you can't see
2011-12-21T13:33:42  <McLeopold> yeah, so you see one food, you can assume the other places
2011-12-21T13:33:48  <McLeopold> then you need less map coverage
2011-12-21T13:34:14  <McLeopold> as long as you know your territory is secure
2011-12-21T13:34:25  <McLeopold> but I think using antimatroids method can help with that
2011-12-21T13:36:02  <jcdny> The biggest problem with my map symmetry code is that I then have too many hill targets and I don't prioritize them - I just start marching off to all the ones I know about.
2011-12-21T13:36:17  <a1k0n> that is what everyone who tried symmetry detection said
2011-12-21T13:37:22  <pairofdice> Bad handling of hills
2011-12-21T13:37:25  <pairofdice> Not of symmetry
2011-12-21T13:37:54  <Scryer> I gained a good number of skill points when my ninja code started working well -- every hill I know about gets one risk-averse ninja.

2011-12-21T14:16:22  <Antimony> Personally, I think the brute force approach is better. Hashes fail on maps with large numbers of identical subsections
2011-12-21T14:16:40  <mcstar> hashes never fail
2011-12-21T14:16:43  <mcstar> they slow down
2011-12-21T14:16:47  <jcdny> the brute force solution is too slow
2011-12-21T14:16:59  <mcstar> (should)
2011-12-21T14:17:26  <BenJackson> does slow matter?  you can spread the work out over the early turns
2011-12-21T14:17:29  <Antimony> brute force will always give you the correct answer
2011-12-21T14:17:32  <Antimony> thats what I do

Is trueskill and mass game supposed to make a "proper" ranking at the end? Or is it going to oscillate again and again?
2011-12-21T15:26:54  <mcstar> yeah, or that
2011-12-21T15:27:06  <mcstar> cause games can differ hugely
2011-12-21T15:27:13  <mcstar> because of different environments
2011-12-21T15:27:26  <mcstar> the skill of a player that the alg. is trying to compute
2011-12-21T15:27:27  <Surya> Clearly, depending on the number of players, the range at the begining, waters ...
2011-12-21T15:27:30  <mcstar> is not constant
2011-12-21T15:28:03  <Surya> (by range at the begining, I mean distance between enemy hills)
2011-12-21T15:28:09  <thestinger> Surya: starting positions relative to other bots changes everything
2011-12-21T15:28:17  <Antimatroid> I still expect a lot of change I. The top 100 before things stablisise to some degree
2011-12-21T15:28:27  <Antimatroid> Question is, are we goi g to let it stabilize?
2011-12-21T15:28:35  <mcstar> i imagine, in this case, (differring envrionments) the result will be very much dependent upon game-ordering(player matching)
2011-12-21T15:28:37  <Antimatroid> I think it would beq a shame if we don't
2011-12-21T15:29:04  <BenJackson> thestinger: how are you feeling about your rank?
2011-12-21T15:29:08  <mcstar> Antimatroid: its possible that it cant stabilize
2011-12-21T15:29:13  <mcstar> thats what er are getting at
2011-12-21T15:29:16  <mcstar> we*
2011-12-21T15:29:21  <thestinger> BenJackson: I think the 20 to 40 range is where I should be, so it's fine :)
2011-12-21T15:29:23  <Surya> Yeah, I got the following problem on my bot: I kamikaze a lot when an enemy is close to my hill, so they can't see me nor take my hills. Obviously I don't take in account the number of my ants (sigh) so I lose a lot of games when I'm close from someone
2011-12-21T15:29:31  <bretep> Are the servers going to shut down at the 'winner deadline'?
2011-12-21T15:29:33  <thestinger> BenJackson: I had some unlucky games, but now I've had 2 lucky ones
2011-12-21T15:29:36  <Antimatroid> Mcstar: sure, but I think it can a lot more than currently
2011-12-21T15:29:47  <thestinger> BenJackson: unhappy with the maps tho :P
2011-12-21T15:29:52  <BenJackson> yeah
2011-12-21T15:29:57  <BenJackson> the maps could be better
2011-12-21T15:30:06  <BenJackson> on the one hand I like new random maps
2011-12-21T15:30:07  <Antimatroid> A lot better :p
2011-12-21T15:30:21  <BenJackson> on the other selecting "good"maps would have been nice
2011-12-21T15:30:26  <thestinger> only played on one really big open map, which my bot does well on
2011-12-21T15:30:45  <BenJackson> thestinger: the phase I'm in now (coming down from 1st) is the part where my bot is whipped back to the right rank
2011-12-21T15:30:52  <BenJackson> I knew it was coming but it's still hard to watch :)
2011-12-21T15:31:09  <thestinger> well, we both got a chance to hold #1
2011-12-21T15:31:35  <thestinger> I got to hang onto it for almost a whole day due to the slow game rate for the top bots :)
2011-12-21T15:31:49  <Antimatroid> I don't like hand selecting maps, it adds human bias as to which aspects we want to give an advantage

2011-12-21T15:41:30  <BenJackson> Antimony: I used simulated annealing which is similar to a constraint solver

2011-12-21T15:41:59  <BenJackson> Antimony: and I stole the idea for possible ants and it worked quite well (I think I heard it from you on IRC)
2011-12-21T15:42:12  <BenJackson> and I also use influence functions all over, mostly derived from global bfs's
2011-12-21T15:42:21  <thestinger> mcstar: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/website/ranking_json.php
2011-12-21T15:42:39  <BenJackson> if I had it to do again I'd compute a lot of the same influence info but use a global solver for territory
2011-12-21T15:42:40  <thestinger> I just got the ids by fetching the first page and searching for my entry
2011-12-21T15:42:52  <BenJackson> (my ant spread-out is brute force in the annealing score function)
2011-12-21T15:42:56  <Antimony> I think I should have added some randomness into my constraint solver, to make it more like annealing
2011-12-21T15:43:11  <Antimony> greedy search is good for finding a solution, but terrible for exhaustive search
2011-12-21T15:43:15  <BenJackson> I wrote a maximum matching implementation (the O(n^3) "fast" version)
2011-12-21T15:43:19  <BenJackson> but I didn't actually use it
2011-12-21T15:43:31  <mcstar> thestinger: so i can get the same with manual search for the right org_id?

2011-12-21T15:43:59  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, figure out which page you're on in the rankings, then do ranking_json.php?page=11 or w/e
2011-12-21T15:44:07  <thestinger> and find your org_id, country_id and language_id
2011-12-21T15:44:12  <mcstar> yeah
2011-12-21T15:44:48  <thestinger> C++11 narrows it down a lot
2011-12-21T15:45:28  <mcstar> whenever i want to move a bunch of ants, i use hungarian matching
2011-12-21T15:45:35  <mcstar> for example, battle
2011-12-21T15:45:46  <mcstar> the rows are the ants
2011-12-21T15:45:52  <mcstar> the cols are the possible next tiles
2011-12-21T15:46:05  <mcstar> so it guarantees that no two ant will step an 1 tile
2011-12-21T15:46:09  <mcstar> on
2011-12-21T15:46:32  <BenJackson> I implemented Kuhn Munkres
2011-12-21T15:46:51  <BenJackson> which is the graphy-version of hungarian that's O(n^3) instead of O(n^4)
2011-12-21T15:47:06  <meduza> mcstar: +1 for hungarian
2011-12-21T15:47:21  <mcstar> i use it for expansion too
2011-12-21T15:47:42  <mcstar> i didnt write mine
2011-12-21T15:47:46  <mcstar> i found it on the net
2011-12-21T15:47:52  <mcstar> the author is in the source
2011-12-21T15:48:14  <mcstar> it was quite fast so i didnt bother with making mine, but i probably should have
2011-12-21T15:48:20  <mcstar> for experience
2011-12-21T15:48:25  <tetrahedron> mcstar: we have also used hungarian, except that we used it for fighting: it gave the initial direction for ants to move, which we passed to genetic search
2011-12-21T15:48:49  <meduza> BenJackson: kuhn munkers and hungarian method are the same thing. aren't the?
2011-12-21T15:49:01  <mcstar> no
2011-12-21T15:49:09  <mcstar> like he said kuhn is faster
2011-12-21T15:49:23  <mcstar> the very first alg. was called hungarian
2011-12-21T15:49:31  <mcstar> and those guys imporved on it
2011-12-21T15:49:33  <BenJackson> meduza: hungarian is the row elimination one
2011-12-21T15:49:58  <meduza> BenJackson: oh, then i also use kuhn munkers
2011-12-21T15:49:58  <BenJackson> kuhn munkres uses augmenting paths from an alternating tree
2011-12-21T15:50:10  <mcstar> https://github.com/liquid-phynix/aicbot/blob/master/hungarian.cpp
2011-12-21T15:50:28  <BenJackson> my distinction may be incorrect, but it was the only one I could find that turned up the right literature
2011-12-21T15:50:28  <Antimatroid> Damn, I didn't know about that :(
2011-12-21T15:50:37  <meduza> BenJackson: yep, i thought it was initially introduced in hungarian algorithm
2011-12-21T15:50:39  <mcstar> Antimatroid: ?
2011-12-21T15:50:50  <mcstar> Antimatroid: i was telling you about this in april
2011-12-21T15:50:54  <Antimatroid> Hungarian algo
2011-12-21T15:50:56  <BenJackson> I ended up buying _Graphs, Networks and Algorithms_ by Dieter Jungnickel because it had such a good description of the algorithm
2011-12-21T15:50:58  <Antimatroid> Lol
2011-12-21T15:51:02  <Antimatroid> Always
2011-12-21T15:51:10  <mcstar> remember? i did similar thing in common lisp
2011-12-21T15:51:17  <mcstar> and i had an implementation there
2011-12-21T15:51:27  <Antimatroid> Nope :p
2011-12-21T15:51:28  <tetrahedron> we used this implementation - one of the best - http://acm.mipt.ru/twiki/bin/view/Algorithms/HungarianAlgorithmCPP
2011-12-21T15:51:30  <mcstar> i used it for optimal food gathering

2011-12-21T16:16:48  <BenJackson> maybe the engine rules should have specifically allowed for gc

2011-12-21T16:17:10  <Surya> My bot is c# and I had no timeout because I test it all the time. But it's not a proof his code is bad (my 2 cents ;))
2011-12-21T16:17:10  <Antimatroid> Probably worth at least investigating
2011-12-21T16:17:21  <BenJackson> eg if a bot says "gc" instead of "go" it gets an extra turn between turns where it calls System.gc()
2011-12-21T16:17:22  <Antimatroid> No change of settings
2011-12-21T16:17:41  <amstan> there hasn't been any changes on the workers since dec 10th

2011-12-21T16:18:23  <amstan> BenJackson: please tell him that
2011-12-21T16:18:24  <Antimatroid> Has he let someone else run the code to see if it actually does/n't timeout?
2011-12-21T16:18:41  <amstan> Antimatroid: so i'm not saying that the timeouts are not real
2011-12-21T16:19:04  <amstan> but there's nothing that can be done, everyone's equally(same language) affected by them
2011-12-21T16:19:06  <Surya> Is there a way to know for sure it's not his code causing problems? Maybe new maps make bugs suddently appear?

2011-12-21T16:20:55  <Antimatroid> Amstan: yeah I just mean if something on the server side is going wrong for them to time out then we have a problem, if it's just an issue with their bot then that's their problem and I don't think we allow them to change anything
2011-12-21T16:21:02  <amstan> my personal policy is that if you pick a language that has unpredictable GC, you have to accept all the problems that it might happen because of it
2011-12-21T16:21:11  <meduza> amstan: my bot experiencing timeout issues sometimes (twice for the finals), but i'm not sure that it's not an implementation bug :)
2011-12-21T16:21:12  <bretep> tbh, I do think the servers aren't really stable.
2011-12-21T16:21:17  <BenJackson> amstan: or not accept, perhaps, but work around

2011-12-21T16:21:33  <tomb___> i also see timeouts for lama3oid on Dec 13, 14, 15, 17
2011-12-21T16:21:43  <meduza> amstan: but likely it's not a bug
2011-12-21T16:21:44  <tomb___> a bunch of them
2011-12-21T16:21:44  <amstan> yes, like reuse the same data structures and don't rely on gc
2011-12-21T16:22:07  <Antimatroid> Yeah, I mean if there was literally an issue with the server we don't know about, but that seems unlikely to me, there aren't that many people complaining
2011-12-21T16:22:20  <bretep> I put the gc off in python :v
2011-12-21T16:22:29  <BenJackson> one of the main reasons I went straight from python to c++ was that I wanted to be 110% sure that I could manipulate grids of things without any risk of generating tons of garbage
2011-12-21T16:22:33  <meduza> amstan: we should throw away our java and .net and code in c
2011-12-21T16:22:47  <jab_bott> will there be any special battles - for example reduce the turntime and see who works best at very low processing requirements.. and play with visible/attack radii to see whose bots are the most adaptable?
2011-12-21T16:22:54  <_flag> If xathis doesn't timeout no other java bot should timeout, right?
2011-12-21T16:23:02  <pairofdice> Riiiight.

2011-12-21T16:23:37  <QGazQ> I had quite bad problems with gc, even doing system.gc etc didn't help.  Ran it through profiler something to do with allocating (and so needing GC) on around 100MB per turn
2011-12-21T16:23:52  <QGazQ> Changed the code so I had a few pools of objects instead and the problem went away
2011-12-21T16:24:17  <QGazQ> As I say I might not have a good bot, but it has taught me things about java (day job I'm c++)

2011-12-21T16:28:18  <thestinger> lots of my versions used up almost all the turntime
2011-12-21T16:28:45  <thestinger> moving each 100 ants takes a minimum of 10ms due to how the engine reads it in

2011-12-21T16:29:25  <thestinger> my final version doesn't use a timer tho because using up all the time to generate and evaluate more enemy moves didn't help
2011-12-21T16:29:48  <QGazQ> Yer in java I had to rewrite the input parcer a bit, the one in the starter bot took almost all the time on multi hill maps on the first turn

2011-12-21T16:30:33  <QGazQ> Also when do most people give up time wise? To be on the safe side I stop and do the output and a few tidy up bits when theres only 100ms left
2011-12-21T16:30:34  <jab_bott> I was delighted to get up to 96th - but quickly went out of the top 100 again, back down at 180ish again now I think
2011-12-21T16:30:34  <amstan> for a bot without timers..

2011-12-21T16:40:39  <mleise> You'll have to take a look at the video option and see if it meets your expectations.
2011-12-21T16:40:46  <jab_bott> amstan: so how about some special side-contests to see which bots can cope with parameters changing like different attack radius and shorter turn times?

2011-12-21T16:40:55  <mleise> The canvas uses JS *only*
2011-12-21T16:41:06  <_flag> mleise: Because the java visualizer with jab_bott's additions crashes on me so I can't even use the video output feature

2011-12-21T16:41:11  <_flag> Only the canvas one works
2011-12-21T16:41:14  <bretep> canvas uses js, there is also a jar visualizer
2011-12-21T16:41:16  <jab_bott> mleise: the problem is that with lots of visualizations, the java one bites the dust
2011-12-21T16:41:38  <mleise> jab_bott: I am aware of that.
2011-12-21T16:41:47  <amstan> jab_bott: try giving it more memory
2011-12-21T16:41:51  <amstan> jab_bott: or try sun java
2011-12-21T16:42:09  <mleise> The Java visualizer wraps the JS visualizer, simulating a web environment (as far as I needed it) using Rhino (from Mozilla)
2011-12-21T16:42:15  <BenJackson> hm, nothing weird seems to be happening near rank 3000
2011-12-21T16:42:28  * amstan checks rank 3000 just in case
2011-12-21T16:42:56  <mleise> JavaScript inside Java is a major pita: it is slow and uses insane amounts of memory
2011-12-21T16:43:16  <amstan> nope.. just a lot of bots with the same skill

2011-12-21T16:43:40  <amstan> yeah.. just give java a lot of memory, give it some swap

2011-12-21T16:46:43  <ChrisH_> yeah, pretty much a standoff, and my spawn control was the difference that let me keep my isolated hill alive until the turn limit
2011-12-21T16:47:00  <mleise> that will never work
2011-12-21T16:47:38  <mleise> All the JS is compiled to Java byte code to make it run faster, so no dynamic loading of JS code.
2011-12-21T16:47:46  <amstan> jab_bott, mleise, _flag: so you are all here, just put it together and you might be able to fix it

2011-12-21T16:49:07  <jab_bott> _flag: basically it sends all the commands you output into the JSON and the visualizer parses them.. not very elegant or fast, but quick to add to the existing visualizer

2011-12-21T17:06:59  <jab_bott> well it's clear from some games that the scoring and multi-player start positions sometimes create unfair games... but personally I think that's fine as on average over all the games it should even out
2011-12-21T17:08:14  <_flag> jab_bott: I think I've fixed it. It seems the canvas engine was either checking for or simply ignoring some of my input that was invalid, whereas the java version simply crashed on it, causing me to believe there was a problem with the java version; It works now
2011-12-21T17:08:34  <bugnuts> My view is that "unfair starts" also reward bots that made an effort to play more strategically.

2011-12-21T17:30:15  <bretep> Maybe a poll of the suggestions would give a good idea what idea is liked?

2011-12-21T17:38:26  <bretep> Timeouts/crashes are annoying, haven't had a crash in the final. But I've had several time-outs.
2011-12-21T17:38:27  <jab_bott> maybe like a maze and you have to rescue/collect something and/or destroy somethign and escape/find the exit
2011-12-21T17:39:05  <avdg> meh, it looks like the java visualizer also freezes my irc app (dunno, I have no hints)
2011-12-21T17:39:24  <Scryer> ... while the other players are rescuing and collecting stuff, or waiting to mug you for it at the exit?
2011-12-21T17:40:00  <jab_bott> Scryer: perhaps.. maybe it's who can get there faster (no mugging) or who can be the most devious/strategic
2011-12-21T17:40:34  <Scryer> jab_bott: Blowing stuff up is engaging... that's why I suggested it. :)
2011-12-21T17:40:42  <jab_bott> or even a game like marble madness would be cool, racing down some path with obstacles and trying to bash each othe roff the edge! :D

2011-12-21T18:13:03  <BenJackson> also nobody is really saving info from turn to turn
2011-12-21T18:13:06  <BenJackson> which has pros and cons
2011-12-21T18:13:13  <BenJackson> so maybe I can't look ahead 5 turns in one turn
2011-12-21T18:13:18  <mcstar> it complicated matters too much for me
2011-12-21T18:13:22  <mcstar> i couldnt hsndle the complexity
2011-12-21T18:13:22  <BenJackson> but maybe I can look ahead 2 turns per turn and build up 20 turns ahead over 10 turns
2011-12-21T18:13:25  <BenJackson> for a strategic goal

2011-12-21T19:09:42  <bugnuts> so if you tile 2 squares which have rotational symmetry it would be 8

2011-12-21T19:11:15  <Antimatroi> McLeopold symmetrically equivalent locations are in the same equivalence class and the equivalence classes partition the map
2011-12-21T19:11:58  <bugnuts> well for a single mirror every point has 1 other point that is equivalent.  a second mirroring doubles that to 4.  Then if you take that rectangle with 4 points that are the same and tile the torus
2011-12-21T19:12:11  <bugnuts> with 6 of them it would then be 24
2011-12-21T19:12:18  <a1k0n> i don't think any of the map symmetries are that complicated though
2011-12-21T19:12:29  <a1k0n> but i guess they could have been, and you would have detected it, so bravo
2011-12-21T19:12:43  <Antimatroi> I did the symmetries
2011-12-21T19:12:48  <bugnuts> there are ones which are 1 mirroring that is then tiled.
2011-12-21T19:13:06  <Antimatroi> Bug nuts, did translating the rotationally symmetric maps make detection harder for you?
2011-12-21T19:13:12  <Antimatroi> Antimony said not really

2011-12-21T19:13:35  <Antimatroi> It did at least rule out trivial symmetry detection

2011-12-21T19:36:58  <antimac> it's worth noting that if you search over friends but don't move ants statically, then sometimes the bottom right ant might move east instead of south, because they both appear to have the same path distance to the targets

2011-12-21T19:41:24  <antimac> i compromised, what i did was..
2011-12-21T19:41:31  <tetrahedron> or you could try to solve this problem with hungarian algorithm maybe
2011-12-21T19:42:15  <antimac> search over ants and move towards a closest target if possible, otherwise don't make a move, so bottom right 'a' would sit still and trapped 'a' would walk down until it was fully trapped
2011-12-21T19:42:25  <antimac> then to help get trapped ants out i would randomise path finding
2011-12-21T19:43:06  <antimac> although if bottom right 'a' was then on the shortest path to another target it would go off in that direction
2011-12-21T19:43:10  <teapotahedron_ni> antimac, do you mean randomizing just the order of directions?
2011-12-21T19:43:22  <antimac> which leads to ants jumping around a bit, but also alows ants to nicely "flow" paste targets that block up
2011-12-21T19:43:38  <antimac> teapotahedron_ni: yeah, so it sort of does a random walk along the shortest paths
2011-12-21T19:43:47  <antimac> although you can have chokepoints that all shortest paths go through
2011-12-21T19:43:53  <McLeopold> antimac: I think it would be optimal, but I need to test it now :)

2011-12-21T19:44:40  <antimac> randomising shortest paths isn't as simple as i thought either
2011-12-21T19:44:47  <antimac> i do it the trivial way, but it's far from optimao
2011-12-21T19:46:19  <teapotahedron_ni> you know to walk randomly away from optimal direction. it's mostly useless, but in case of many ants it could help them to spread
2011-12-21T19:47:21  <antimac> but if the ants are blocked to their target and it stays blocked, it allows the ants to flow past the blockage
2011-12-21T19:47:47  <antimac> so i only move ants statically if they're on the battle border, otherwise an ant doesn't specifically sit still, so they can move through blockages

2011-12-21T19:52:07  <antimac> at the end you probably want to move the top row ants around towards the free battle border
2011-12-21T19:52:47  <teapotahedron_ni> i think the previous example could be solved by randomly making "mistakes" in pathfinding. of course - it's not optimal, but..

2011-12-21T20:09:47  <McLeopold> so, basically, any spot where multiple ants want to go, solve the solution where the total distance for all of them is minimal
2011-12-21T20:10:11  <McLeopold> and if 1 of the ants only has 1 direction, that takes priority

2011-12-21T20:16:51  <pairofdice> hours even
2011-12-21T20:17:05  <BenJackson> seems like a long time.  is there still churn in the 2-3000 range?

2011-12-21T20:17:31  <McLeopold> we are converging quite nicely now http://pastebin.com/qyAhD1dd
2011-12-21T20:18:12  <McLeopold> I think we can get all sigmas below 1.5 in the next 2 days
2011-12-21T20:18:17  <BenJackson> how is top by mu tracking top by score?
2011-12-21T20:18:30  <McLeopold> skill?
2011-12-21T20:18:37  <BenJackson> er, yes
2011-12-21T20:18:44  <McLeopold> let me check
2011-12-21T20:20:04  <antimac> my sigma is on the high end

2011-12-21T20:21:04  <BenJackson> McLeopold: so help me I just had this "idea" where you could make a webpage where every time you visit you'd get the results of a db query...
2011-12-21T20:21:56  <McLeopold> so, like, every web page in existance?
2011-12-21T20:22:02  <BenJackson> right
2011-12-21T20:22:09  <McLeopold> I think it might work
2011-12-21T20:22:55  <McLeopold> btw, that top list is very stable
2011-12-21T20:23:04  <McLeopold> for all three versions of "top"
2011-12-21T20:23:51  <McLeopold> we would need to see quite a few upsets to start changing it, which is possible
2011-12-21T20:24:23  <McLeopold> basically, if 2 bots' actual mu is a low and a high

2011-12-21T20:27:48  <antimac> yeah i know
2011-12-21T20:28:02  <antimac> i'm curious as to whether that's just more time or better bots at the last minute or no idea?
2011-12-21T20:28:06  <BenJackson> my v1 bot would be losing to starters as it timed out

2011-12-21T20:29:26  <BenJackson> there were hopes of 200 games at the top
2011-12-21T20:29:41  <antimac> like runevision and komaki, they could well end up top 10
2011-12-21T20:29:59  <antimac> that looks very unlikely at present
2011-12-21T20:30:01  <codetiger> any approx calcs how many games top 100 will have before the end
2011-12-21T20:30:32  <BenJackson> there will be 36h left when the cutoff goes up next
2011-12-21T20:31:30  <BenJackson> if they do another incremental slide up to the 500 point with 24h left
2011-12-21T20:32:02  <BenJackson> top bots might hit 150-175
2011-12-21T20:32:10  <pairofdice> 10 minutes between games at 500 bots?
2011-12-21T20:32:20  <codetiger> am wondering if this time is enough to decide ranking. May be for ranks in 1000 I mean

2011-12-21T23:36:57  <amstan> Kettling: not surprising
2011-12-21T23:37:02  <BenJackson> wow, two games in a row I would have benefitted from more turns
2011-12-21T23:37:43  <codetiger> I get a game every 45 mins
2011-12-21T23:37:58  <codetiger> until yesterday, I thought my bot was forgoten
2011-12-21T23:38:12  <UncleVasya> lol http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=311193&user=53
2011-12-21T23:38:50  <amstan> UncleVasya: that ant is bored
2011-12-21T23:39:34  <BenJackson> actually that's a very very reasonable play on that map
2011-12-21T23:39:50  <amstan> there's a very reasonable course of action
2011-12-21T23:39:50  <BenJackson> although I suppose both bots could back out of it to freedom
2011-12-21T23:39:55  <codetiger> Nice game... Seems those bots are too concerned about their territory
2011-12-21T23:40:03  <amstan> you can squeeze bots out of that area just fine
2011-12-21T23:40:05  <amstan> get some food
2011-12-21T23:40:08  <amstan> then surround the enemy
2011-12-21T23:40:22  <BenJackson> I should make a scenario and test my bot
2011-12-21T23:40:45  <BenJackson> oh I can just pass it this input
2011-12-21T23:40:47  <UncleVasya> not really. Im my bot ants in battle aren't considered by another systems (food gathering, exploring etc)
2011-12-21T23:40:48  <codetiger> my bot would sacrifice under such conditions

2011-12-21T23:42:32  <amstan> sessile?
2011-12-21T23:42:35  <BenJackson> not moving
2011-12-21T23:42:42  <BenJackson> opposite of motile
2011-12-21T23:42:44  <amstan> oh, lol
2011-12-21T23:43:38  <amstan> BenJackson: i could put you in touch with that guy, see if you want to play against him on the same map
2011-12-21T23:43:56  <BenJackson> I could just download the map and make a scenario
2011-12-21T23:44:03  <BenJackson> but at this poitn I'm trying not to get caught up in bot hacking
2011-12-21T23:44:05  <BenJackson> just let the finals go

2011-12-21T23:55:30  <BenJackson> I wonder if 2500s are tutorial bots?
2011-12-21T23:55:37  <BenJackson> I don't know the tut bot behavior well enough
2011-12-21T23:55:45  <BenJackson> but there are striking similarities to all these bots:

2011-12-21T23:56:55  <BenJackson> oops that was 2000s even
2011-12-21T23:57:22  <analyst74> at least they don't seem to be killing themselves?
2011-12-21T23:57:33  <BenJackson> I think that was part of the tutorial
2011-12-21T23:57:42  <analyst74> oh
2011-12-21T23:58:00  <BenJackson> ok at 1500 people know hills at least sometimes
2011-12-21T23:59:05  <BenJackson> sliding the cut to 2000 seems really safe
