2011-03-28T10:02:02  <amstan> namina: according to https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues#issue/3 it's Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Sep 15 2010, 16:22:56)
2011-03-28T10:04:14  <namina> cool. thanks
2011-03-28T10:06:19  <phirenz> namina, try launching it with python2 instead of just python

2011-03-28T10:10:09  <amstan> run it with python2
2011-03-28T10:10:20  <namina> yep, that was the issue

2011-03-28T11:31:20  <Stocha> i think the fact that google was sponsor was of big help in getting the challenge sucessful
2011-03-28T11:31:52  <Stocha> also it being "free for all with no money involved" is interesting.
2011-03-28T11:32:18  <Stocha> Reading the wiki i saw that the team is looking for sponsor and money.
2011-03-28T11:32:39  <Stocha> or is the money intended for covering the costs of the servers and such only ?

2011-03-28T11:35:16  <Stocha> the five minute starting guide is buggy. It says submissions are closed :p
2011-03-28T11:36:10  <Stocha> I there any official entry in the wiki about how to test a bot ?
2011-03-28T11:36:38  <Stocha> say against one of the starter bot. Or to test two starte bots against one another.

2011-03-28T11:43:16  <namina> don't think so, not for ants anyway, not too hard though...
2011-03-28T11:43:35  <namina> just clone the repo and run play_one_game.sh
2011-03-28T11:46:09  <Stocha> So the main skill will be "clone the repo" then.
2011-03-28T11:46:46  <Stocha> i should try to do that.
2011-03-28T11:47:44  <namina> Stocha: Don't even need to do that. If you go to the github page there's a download button top right
2011-03-28T11:47:58  <namina> click that and it should give you a zip of all the code
2011-03-28T11:48:11  <namina> extract that somewhere and you're sorted
2011-03-28T11:48:46  <Stocha> okay
2011-03-28T11:48:52  <Stocha> should i install python or something ?
2011-03-28T11:50:21  <namina> yep. Are you on windows or linux?
2011-03-28T11:51:18  <Stocha> macos i think
2011-03-28T11:51:22  <Stocha> on my laptop
2011-03-28T11:51:26  <Stocha> and debian on my server
2011-03-28T11:51:30  <Stocha> i think
2011-03-28T11:51:45  <Stocha> at the moment i'm trying on my laptop
2011-03-28T11:51:51  <Stocha> the server has no screen
2011-03-28T11:52:03  <Stocha> no keyboard, a no whatsoever
2011-03-28T11:52:33  <Stocha> i'll try to google how to python under macos
2011-03-28T11:52:41  <namina> ok, just try it on your laptop first. I think macs already have python installed...
2011-03-28T11:52:45  <Stocha> but i think i've seen there were version issues also
2011-03-28T11:52:52  <Stocha> oh does it
2011-03-28T11:52:59  <namina> ok, go to a terminal in mac
2011-03-28T11:53:06  <namina> and do 'python'
2011-03-28T11:53:12  <namina> what version does it say

2011-03-28T11:57:18  <Stocha> i think it sort of worked
2011-03-28T11:57:31  <antimatroid> ahhh ffs
2011-03-28T11:57:39  <Stocha> i wish i knew where the game is
2011-03-28T11:57:50  <antimatroid> they want to bring those backscatter machines to australian airports now
2011-03-28T11:57:57  <antimatroid> didn't see that one coming /s
2011-03-28T11:58:03  <Stocha> uh ?
2011-03-28T11:58:28  <Stocha> where is a game output by playonegame.sh ?
2011-03-28T11:58:57  <namina> in viewer/0.replay
2011-03-28T11:59:01  <Stocha> ah okay
2011-03-28T11:59:06  <Stocha> i just found
2011-03-28T11:59:25  <namina> you need to copy and paste that into visualizer/offine.html
2011-03-28T11:59:55  <namina> antimatroid: optional or compulsary?
2011-03-28T12:00:24  <antimatroid> namina: doesn't seem to be much info available, but it's kind of even more pointless if it's optional
2011-03-28T12:00:36  <Stocha> where is offline.html ? :p
2011-03-28T12:01:01  <namina> in the visualizer folder
2011-03-28T12:01:09  <antimatroid> Stocha: this is intended to be much simpler once the contest is live, we're not going to expect all competitors to jump through these hoops
2011-03-28T12:01:53  <namina> just the ones that want to get a head start...
2011-03-28T12:01:59  <namina> :)
2011-03-28T12:02:50  <namina> antimatroid: how's the visualizer going to work?
2011-03-28T12:02:58  <namina> is it always going to be copy and paste?
2011-03-28T12:03:02  <antimatroid> don't ask me that :P
2011-03-28T12:03:14  <antimatroid> no, it should just run with the engine eventually
2011-03-28T12:03:34  <namina> yea, seems sensible
2011-03-28T12:03:36  <antimatroid> you should be able to run the engine passing it arguments for the bots and visualiser
2011-03-28T12:03:49  <antimatroid> (and map and parameters)
2011-03-28T12:03:57  <namina> presumably the java version though
2011-03-28T12:04:33  <antimatroid> although i personally wouldn't be opposed to a .sh or .bat file doing that for people, then expecting htem to be able to edit that
2011-03-28T12:04:43  <Stocha> i can't visualize anything yet :p
2011-03-28T12:04:56  <namina> Stocha: what's happening?
2011-03-28T12:05:22  <Stocha> nohting literrally
2011-03-28T12:05:48  <Stocha> i clicked the "load text below"
2011-03-28T12:05:52  <Stocha> maybe that was wrong ?
2011-03-28T12:06:02  <namina> nope that's right.
2011-03-28T12:06:12  <namina> Are you using safari?
2011-03-28T12:06:26  <Stocha> yes i am
2011-03-28T12:06:30  <namina> haven't tried it in safari... maybe firefox or chrome would work
2011-03-28T12:06:57  <Stocha> i have no errors that i can spot or whatever
2011-03-28T12:07:19  <namina> yea, give it a go in another browser and see what happens
2011-03-28T12:07:24  <UncleVasya> Can we expect something like Galcon Testing Arena in a starterpack?
2011-03-28T12:08:15  <antimatroid> UncleVasya: jBotManager? I wish, if someone wants to make it, go ahead, but i've found no one to yet
2011-03-28T12:08:50  <antimatroid> i'm going to be a sad panda without live tcp games
2011-03-28T12:09:08  <namina> is there going to be an official tcp server?
2011-03-28T12:09:14  <antimatroid> that's the current plan
2011-03-28T12:09:41  <antimatroid> it would be awesome the have something official like jbotmanager so it was really easy for people to get on tc
2011-03-28T12:09:43  <antimatroid> tcp*
2011-03-28T12:09:53  <Stocha> ah i reloaded the .html and then it now works
2011-03-28T12:09:58  <namina> what does jbotmanager do?
2011-03-28T12:10:10  <Stocha> it is quite slow though
2011-03-28T12:10:21  <antimatroid> naminaa: it let you load your bots, play them against each other, play yourself, or play them on tcp
2011-03-28T12:10:42  <namina> hmm.. that would be useful
2011-03-28T12:10:56  <Stocha> is there a way to have it run faster ?
2011-03-28T12:11:06  <namina> i'm sure someone will code it up when everything gets going though
2011-03-28T12:11:12  <antimatroid> Stocha: is it the visualiser or engine running slow?
2011-03-28T12:11:20  <Stocha> the visualizer i think
2011-03-28T12:11:23  <antimatroid> you can use the arrow keys with the visualiser
2011-03-28T12:11:39  <antimatroid> that might allow you to skip through games faster, they go at that speed so you can watch what is happening
2011-03-28T12:12:02  <Stocha> okay arrow keys are good
2011-03-28T12:12:28  <Stocha> so now i shoud modify the javabot and try to make it play right ?
2011-03-28T12:12:30  <antimatroid> if you use the "arrows" at the bottom, it will animate each individual step and pause before doing battle resolution
2011-03-28T12:12:39  <UncleVasya> namina: for me the most amazing thing in JBot Manager was drawing lines from the ships to the planets they fly to.
2011-03-28T12:12:40  <Stocha> or maybe just try to make it play first.
2011-03-28T12:13:06  <antimatroid> i really liked being able to play my own bot
2011-03-28T12:13:10  <antimatroid> that was great for debugging
2011-03-28T12:13:19  <antimatroid> and tcp games being live was awesome
2011-03-28T12:13:20  <namina> UncleVasya: so you could play as a human?
2011-03-28T12:13:30  <antimatroid> namina: yes
2011-03-28T12:13:48  <namina> that is cool, although wouldn't be that useful in ants
2011-03-28T12:13:58  <antimatroid> it would be useful in ants
2011-03-28T12:14:05  <antimatroid> just up the time limit and debug on smaller examples
2011-03-28T12:14:10  <namina> true
2011-03-28T12:15:03  <antimatroid> delt0r_: how's the free time going? :P everyone loved jBotManager!
2011-03-28T12:15:04  <Stocha> i'll take my two gilrs out into the sunshine then see you
2011-03-28T12:17:30  <namina> antimatroid: How come HunterBot shuffles directions to a target?
2011-03-28T12:17:43  <antimatroid> namina: ask McLeopold
2011-03-28T12:18:07  <antimatroid> i haven't had time to play around with bots, i should update the c++ starter bot at some point
2011-03-28T12:18:28  <antimatroid> (i'm trying to keep up at uni while help organise things :P)
2011-03-28T12:18:49  <namina> hmmm... I can see my uni work going downhill rapidsly once this gets going
2011-03-28T12:19:20  <antimatroid> ha, you should have seen me last semester

2011-03-28T12:19:40  <antimatroid> i was enrolled in 5 units, attending classes for another and spending most of my time on planet wars :P
2011-03-28T12:19:46  <namina> haha
2011-03-28T12:20:06  <antimatroid> some of my marks weren't very amazing, but only for units that i didn't really care about
2011-03-28T12:20:56  <namina> how much time does a unit take up?
2011-03-28T12:21:10  <jmcarthur> 1 unit
2011-03-28T12:21:49  <antimatroid> last year it was 3 one hour lectures a tute and assignments
2011-03-28T12:22:08  <antimatroid> this year it's just 2 hours of lectures a week, and i only have 3 units per semester with a small thesis to do
2011-03-28T12:22:12  <antimatroid> so i'm not as bad off as last year
2011-03-28T12:22:27  <antimatroid> i have like less than 1/4 the number or raw classes each week
2011-03-28T12:22:32  <namina> yea, same here in the UK. except I'm on 12 units!!!
2011-03-28T12:22:43  <antimatroid> 12 units in a semester?
2011-03-28T12:22:52  <namina> ok, true
2011-03-28T12:22:53  <antimatroid> that's like 48 hours of classes each week
2011-03-28T12:22:58  <namina> 6 per semester
2011-03-28T12:23:02  <namina> sorry

2011-03-28T12:23:16  <antimatroid> what uni are you at? and what are you studying?
2011-03-28T12:23:32  <namina> Bristol Uni, doing Comp. Sci + Electronics
2011-03-28T12:23:49  <namina> you?
2011-03-28T12:24:04  <antimatroid> uni of tasmania, just doing maths this year
2011-03-28T12:24:10  <antimatroid> yay for unknown unis :P
2011-03-28T12:24:17  <namina> haha
2011-03-28T12:24:36  <antimatroid> (i did cs, economics and maths for my undergrad)
2011-03-28T12:24:56  <namina> ah ok.. Does Aus have same system as US, i.e major
2011-03-28T12:26:48  <antimatroid> um, i don't think so
2011-03-28T12:26:59  <antimatroid> people in the us seem to do a lot more general classes
2011-03-28T12:27:09  <namina> so you pick a degree at the beginning?
2011-03-28T12:27:32  <antimatroid> you sort of declare majors after first year, but dependent on your degree you have your first year units pretty much chosen
2011-03-28T12:28:09  <antimatroid> so you might do a degree in science/business/economics/arts etc. then pick say 4 majors first year, then drop that back to 2/1 major after a year
2011-03-28T12:28:25  <namina> that's quite good
2011-03-28T12:28:39  <namina> i would have liked to have a few more options first year
2011-03-28T12:28:49  <antimatroid> and we don't go directly from say undergrad to phd here, but most undergrad degrees are also 3 years instead of 4
2011-03-28T12:29:24  <antimatroid> but we have what is called an "honours year" which (I think) is basically the fourth year of a us degree, although we often do a small thesis for honours which I'm not sure is there for the fourth year of us undergrad
2011-03-28T12:29:25  <namina> yea undergrad is usually 3 here too
2011-03-28T12:29:44  <antimatroid> what's the prices like that?
2011-03-28T12:30:10  <namina> atm about £3.5k going up to £9k soon
2011-03-28T12:30:35  <antimatroid> my undergrad and honours will put me like AU$30k in debt, but it's debt to the government that only goes up with inflation and I never start to pay back unless i earn over like $40k a year, at which point it's a minimal amount of like 4% of my income per year
2011-03-28T12:30:57  <namina> pretty much exactly the same as here
2011-03-28T12:32:03  <namina> everyone is pretty up in arms about the fee rises here though
2011-03-28T12:32:08  <namina> lots of protests etc.
2011-03-28T12:33:35  <namina> hmmm. getting a bit worried about the speed of python, when the number of ants gets high these bots are slowing down a lot...
2011-03-28T12:38:24  <antimatroid> yeah, don't use python :P
2011-03-28T12:39:00  <antimatroid> c++ <3
2011-03-28T12:39:12  <antimatroid> although i'm seriously contemplating just taking the plunge and trying to do it in haskell
2011-03-28T12:39:23  <namina> mmm, I know but I hate c++, I don't really want to do it in c
2011-03-28T12:39:29  <namina> and I want to learn python
2011-03-28T12:39:39  <namina> so I'm just going to have to optimise lots
2011-03-28T12:39:41  <antimatroid> what's to hate about c++ other than templates and not being able to overload operator precedence?
2011-03-28T12:40:26  <namina> irrational hatred, stems from dealing with lots of awful code a while ago
2011-03-28T12:40:39  <antimatroid> ah, i have an irrational hatred of java
2011-03-28T12:40:43  <antimatroid> i refuse to touch it
2011-03-28T12:41:03  <namina> yea, i used to have that too. Got over when they made me use it at uni though
2011-03-28T12:42:03  <namina> my other option is learning lisp
2011-03-28T12:42:05  <namina> :p
2011-03-28T12:42:20  <antimatroid> not a bad option :P
2011-03-28T12:42:33  <namina> btw Haskell is horrible
2011-03-28T12:42:56  <namina> really clever but horrible
2011-03-28T12:43:07  <antimatroid> i haven't really liked some of the syntax yet, but i like the generality
2011-03-28T12:43:20  <antimatroid> well, i have really liked some of the syntax
2011-03-28T12:43:24  <antimatroid> but some bits have bugged me
2011-03-28T12:44:12  <antimatroid> D sounds more like my perfect language, but people keep saying it has bugs
2011-03-28T12:45:56  <namina> hmmm. tbh I haven't really tried to learn it properly, just did a couple of small projects... took a while to get my head around
2011-03-28T12:47:45  <antimatroid> yeah, it's a beast to understand
2011-03-28T12:47:56  <namina> I really like the idea of lisp at the moment, just wish it wasn't so fragmented
2011-03-28T12:51:21  <antimatroid> janzert: you about?
2011-03-28T12:51:35  <janzert> a bit
2011-03-28T12:51:40  <antimatroid> have you ever considered treating arimaa as a kind of graph game rather than tree?
2011-03-28T12:51:56  <dwchandler> antimatroid: here's a summary of what's not to like about C++: http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/defective.html
2011-03-28T12:52:27  <janzert> technically with a transposition table it is being treated as a graph ;)
2011-03-28T12:54:11  <janzert> but I'm sure I don't really know what you mean
2011-03-28T12:54:47  <janzert> I never build an actual tree or graph anywhere
2011-03-28T12:55:55  <antimatroid> well, the "game graph" would have decision nodes and terminal nodes, but you don't require it to be a tree, so if you do a move and undo it the next turn (same as them, getting back to the same state) you go back to the same node rather than a new node 2 layers down in a tree
2011-03-28T12:56:14  <antimatroid> you lose perfect recall, but that doesn't matter?
2011-03-28T12:56:47  <janzert> a TT would pick up that case
2011-03-28T12:57:19  <antimatroid> that would be the best way to treat those games when thinking generally though yeah?
2011-03-28T12:57:31  <janzert> of course you actually do have to be careful because if you treat it the same you are ignoring the repetition rule
2011-03-28T12:57:33  <antimatroid> and for tron, tic tac toe etc. the dag games i had the other day?
2011-03-28T12:57:55  <antimatroid> i didn't know of the repitition rule, that breaks that
2011-03-28T12:58:12  <antimatroid> although one could just heavily weight against repitition
2011-03-28T12:58:13  <janzert> 3rd repetition is an illegal move
2011-03-28T12:58:50  <janzert> many bots just ignore that in the search search
2011-03-28T12:59:21  <janzert> but it can cause problems with missing forced wins especially in some end games

2011-03-28T13:05:29  <namina> wow, arimaa looks complex
2011-03-28T13:07:23  <antimatroid> oh i just had the best game idea, i call it tronants
2011-03-28T13:07:57  <antimatroid> multiplayer tron, but you can move any of your "walls" like it's an ant each turn, with the same battle options from ants, just no food, you spawn by moving your ants

2011-03-28T13:08:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: tronants: multiplayer tron, but you can move any of your "walls" like it's an ant each turn, with the same battle options from ants, just no food, you spawn by moving your ants
2011-03-28T13:09:31  <antimatroid> you could make it that you HAVE to move all of your ants each turn
2011-03-28T13:15:49  <janzert> someone talked about a similar variation before, but you could only move out from one section of wall per turn. So closer to tron but there was no special "end" of your wall that always moved.
2011-03-28T13:16:21  <antimatroid> that would be cool too
2011-03-28T13:35:31  <delt0r_> antimatroid: It not going to happen this time round. I have resident permits, job applications, work, and a daughter to kick out of home
2011-03-28T13:35:47  <delt0r_> I'm swamped

2011-03-28T20:43:24  <antimatroid> you can't pass a tuple?
2011-03-28T20:43:24  <namina> then you need to name arguments after the first tuple

2011-03-28T20:44:20  <namina> you can, but if func is defined as taking (x,y) then you have to pass (*mytuple)
2011-03-28T20:44:32  <namina> but doesn't work with more than one tuple
2011-03-28T20:44:56  <namina> so you can't do (*mytuple,*mytuple1)

2011-03-28T21:36:20  <namina> right... thanks
2011-03-28T21:38:01  <sigh> namina: the starter pack one will be updated when McLeopold gets around to it, but the emphasis will be more on being easy to understand and clear
2011-03-28T21:38:17  <sigh> (although it will be correct as well )
2011-03-28T21:38:45  <namina> yep, that's what it looked like
2011-03-28T21:38:49  <namina> comments galore...

2011-03-28T21:41:05  <sigh> but if you understand python, the comments should help understand what each function does and how it relates to the game

2011-03-28T21:50:57  <antimatroid> i hate comments, the first thing i do with the starter package usually is strip all the commetns
2011-03-28T21:52:20  <jbroman> Code should be written clearly enough that most, especially small or simple sections, do not require them. For higher-level overviews or more opaque code, I find comments often useful.
2011-03-28T21:52:52  <antimatroid> i agree with that, although i broke that terribly yesterday
2011-03-28T21:54:02  <antimatroid> jbroman: http://pastebin.com/09cDq9UF look at that monstrous function :P the logic for incrementing iterators is the worst, but i can't work out how to simplify it
2011-03-28T21:55:46  <jbroman> "(++it_i)--" â€“ this is what I don't like about C++.
2011-03-28T21:55:56  <sigh> wtf
2011-03-28T21:56:09  <antimatroid> i couldn't work out how to get the next value of it_i without incrementing it
2011-03-28T21:56:13  <jbroman> Compact and efficient, but it easily becomes as opaque as Perl.
2011-03-28T21:56:13  <antimatroid> that was my best solution
2011-03-28T21:56:15  *** jmcarthur is now known as jmcarthurHORSE
2011-03-28T21:56:32  <sigh> o_O
2011-03-28T21:56:51  <jbroman> I don't know the C++ standard library, or language for that matter, well enough to say what the best way to do it is. That's just the sort of thing that makes me want to do pure C99 instead. :P
2011-03-28T21:57:18  <sigh> jbroman: you can obfuscate c as well :)
2011-03-28T21:57:23  <antimatroid> in my defense, that's iteratively removing the equivalent of rows/cols in an n-dimensional tensor
2011-03-28T21:57:38  <antimatroid> and fairly efficiently too
2011-03-28T21:57:41  <jbroman> sigh: You can, but not nearly as much as C++ â€“Â especially unintentionally.
2011-03-28T21:58:05  <jbroman> antimatroid: Oh, I don't mean to attack your code. It may well be an efficient solution to the problem at hand.
2011-03-28T21:58:23  <antimatroid> jbroman: feel free to attack my code anytime anyway :)
2011-03-28T21:58:33  <jbroman> And if I understood C++ iterators, it might even be clear enough.
2011-03-28T21:58:36  *** jmcarthurHORSE is now known as jmcarthur
2011-03-28T21:58:53  <antimatroid> it's not something i would choose to use
2011-03-28T21:59:07  <jbroman> I've just observed that some languages make it far too easy to write terrible code (C++ and Perl very much fall into this category).
2011-03-28T21:59:33  <antimatroid> meh, you can write awful code in any language
2011-03-28T21:59:35  <sigh> if you follow Pelr best practices you don't get into too much trouble
2011-03-28T21:59:37  <jbroman> Naturally, a good programmer can write good code in any language, and a bad programmer can write bad code in any language.
2011-03-28T21:59:39  <antimatroid> look at my python code for example :P
2011-03-28T21:59:40  <sigh> *perl
2011-03-28T21:59:56  <antimatroid> i'm slowly learning from sigh
2011-03-28T22:00:05  <antimatroid> (and others, but mostly sigh)
2011-03-28T22:00:22  <jbroman> But I've seen a lot more Perl that looks like "11 || $_ =~ /a/g"
2011-03-28T22:00:35  <jbroman> But sure, it's completely possible to write clear and well-structured Perl.
2011-03-28T22:01:13  <jbroman> But one of my favourite things about Python is that you seldom see poorly-indented code because it's difficult to write Python without proper indentation. :P
2011-03-28T22:01:14  <sigh> Perl started off badly with it's "There's more than one way to do it" motto
2011-03-28T22:01:24  <sigh> imo
2011-03-28T22:01:29  <sigh> *its
2011-03-28T22:02:01  <antimatroid> yeah, up until recently i provided quite a few ways to do things in my games library

2011-03-28T22:02:08  <antimatroid> i recently stripped it to as few things as possible
2011-03-28T22:02:20  <jbroman> Short is good for some things, like shells or extremely common notations, but for more larger code, I will happily take longer notations that are clearer.
2011-03-28T22:02:25  <jbroman> I actually like Objective-C in this regard.
2011-03-28T22:02:50  <antimatroid> few ways* as possibly
2011-03-28T22:02:57  <antimatroid> ergh, e and y always kill me
2011-03-28T22:03:03  <sigh> jbroman: I take it you despise J :P
2011-03-28T22:03:23  <jbroman> sigh: For non-golf, yeah.
2011-03-28T22:03:41  <jbroman> It's a cool toy, but I'd never write anything nontrivial in it.
2011-03-28T22:03:46  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-28T22:04:16  <jbroman> If you said "Hey, let's write a web server in J!" (and were not kidding), I would probably punch you.
2011-03-28T22:04:33  <sigh> :D
2011-03-28T22:04:45  <sigh> ok fine... I'll write it in BrainFuck
2011-03-28T22:05:43  <antimatroid> jbroman: i feel that would have been worthy of bash.org back in the day

2011-03-28T23:30:46  <antimatroid> hmmm... tempted to apply for google summer of code now
2011-03-28T23:30:57  <antimatroid> but it means working on the gambit source, which is messy
2011-03-28T23:35:49  <sigh> gambit?
2011-03-28T23:36:58  <sigh> ah, sounds like what you are trying to build :P
2011-03-28T23:38:27  <antimatroid> sigh: it is, but it's gross, and easy to break
2011-03-28T23:38:45  <sigh> well, you can make it better :P
2011-03-28T23:38:59  <antimatroid> the way they represent games is even awful
2011-03-28T23:39:24  <antimatroid> i'm tossing up whether it's worth even doing stuff for it for $5k, regardless i like my library much more :P
2011-03-28T23:40:14  <antimatroid> the only thing gambit will be able to do that i can't by the time i've added everything we've done in is get mixed strategy nash equilibria for games with n>2 players
2011-03-28T23:41:06  <antimatroid> well, and quantal response, but that's meh and i'll do that at some point, then people can use ai bots with my library, and i'm adding in way more types of games at some point too (bayesian, cooperation, my dag and graph games, etc.)
2011-03-28T23:41:55  <antimatroid> and what are actually called graphical games (where nodes are players not states)
2011-03-28T23:43:27  <sigh> what's an example of a graphical game?
2011-03-28T23:43:54  <antimatroid> not really sure, i've only ever really looked at the wikipedia page and an algorithmic game theory text
2011-03-28T23:44:05  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_game_theory
2011-03-28T23:44:49  <antimatroid> it's basically saying your neighbouring player nodes are the players whose strategies your utility function depend on
2011-03-28T23:45:16  <antimatroid> so if players payoffs are sparse with who they depend on, it's a more efficient way of representing the game
2011-03-28T23:45:31  <antimatroid> supposedly anyway :P
2011-03-28T23:45:55  <sigh> ah, so it is a different representation, not a different type of game
2011-03-28T23:46:32  <antimatroid> well what do you mean by different type of game?
2011-03-28T23:46:49  <antimatroid> every extensive form game has an isomorphic simultaneous form game
2011-03-28T23:47:03  <antimatroid> (and obviously vice versa)
2011-03-28T23:48:01  <antimatroid> (assuming we're counting imperfect information games)
2011-03-28T23:48:24  <sigh> i don't know... to make an analogy, binary is a representation, integer is a type
2011-03-28T23:48:56  <antimatroid> hmmm, i've seen people refer to both normal and extensive as the "base" game form
2011-03-28T23:49:07  <antimatroid> i would probably go with extensive
2011-03-28T23:49:16  <antimatroid> it's more compact
2011-03-28T23:49:22  <sigh> I don't know what much about game theory anyway :P
