2012-09-14T01:05:32  <n4nd0> hello
2012-09-14T01:06:01  <n4nd0> will there be a new ai challenge during Fall 2012?Â¿
2012-09-14T01:09:00  <antimatroid> n4nd0: nope
2012-09-14T01:09:19  <n4nd0> :(
2012-09-14T01:09:31  <n4nd0> antimatroid: later during 2013?
2012-09-14T01:11:04  <antimatroid> at some point there will be another one (hopefully)
2012-09-14T01:11:09  <antimatroid> but at the moment nobody is working on anything
2012-09-14T01:11:22  <antimatroid> and there's some organisational stuff that needs to be sorted (again nobody is doing that atm)

2012-09-14T05:58:17  <mcstar> this icebone1000 guy was pretty hilarious
2012-09-14T06:01:09  <antimatroid> mcstar: my computer has shit the bed again :|
2012-09-14T06:01:37  <mcstar> you should try to find the reason
2012-09-14T06:01:52  <antimatroid> i can't click things outside of applications
2012-09-14T06:01:59  <antimatroid> like i can't open applications on the left
2012-09-14T06:02:12  <antimatroid> i can't select files on the desktop
2012-09-14T06:02:50  <mcstar> you can move the pointer, but cant click on anything?
2012-09-14T06:02:59  <antimatroid> i can click between tabs on pidgin
2012-09-14T06:03:02  <antimatroid> so i can move it yes
2012-09-14T06:03:12  <antimatroid> but it doesn't do anything when i click on the os stuff itself
2012-09-14T06:03:15  <antimatroid> i tried restarting
2012-09-14T06:03:24  <mcstar> this has nothing to do with restarting

2012-09-14T06:03:49  <antimatroid> well turning shit off and on has done wonders for me over the years :P
2012-09-14T06:03:56  <mcstar> antimatroid: you can almost always switch to a terminal and restart X, not the machine
2012-09-14T06:04:31  <mcstar> but probably, theres some application that messes with the way X works
2012-09-14T06:04:41  <mcstar> and probably, id be enough to kill just that
2012-09-14T06:04:53  <antimatroid> what would do such a thing?
2012-09-14T06:04:57  <antimatroid> maybe the alarm clock
2012-09-14T06:05:01  <antimatroid> i installed that today
2012-09-14T06:05:27  <mcstar> idk, dont really know what the problem is from your description
2012-09-14T06:06:04  <antimatroid> i'm going to restart and open as many relevant stuff as i can before it fucks up (it let me open pidgin)
2012-09-14T06:06:05  <mcstar> you cant use the dock on the left, or click icons on the desktop, but otherwise ok?
2012-09-14T06:06:14  <mcstar> antimatroid: dont restart for the love of god pls

2012-09-14T06:13:59  <mcstar> antimatroid: did  you restart?
2012-09-14T06:14:44  <antimatroid> yes
2012-09-14T06:14:49  <antimatroid> that's how i roll :P
2012-09-14T06:16:38  <mcstar> antimatroid: ctrl+alt+Fn, n=1..6 switches to a terminal
2012-09-14T06:16:43  <mcstar> from x
2012-09-14T06:16:48  <mcstar> you log in
2012-09-14T06:16:57  <antimatroid> yeah i can do that much
2012-09-14T06:16:58  <mcstar> and then you lower the runlevel
2012-09-14T06:17:11  <mcstar> sudo init 3 for exmaple
2012-09-14T06:17:21  <mcstar> that should kill X and the login manager
2012-09-14T06:17:27  <mcstar> and then back to runlevel 5
2012-09-14T06:17:49  <antimatroid> will that kill my login?
2012-09-14T06:17:53  <antimatroid> if so, why not just restart?
2012-09-14T06:18:03  <mcstar> what login?
2012-09-14T06:18:16  <mcstar> you stay logged in the terminal
2012-09-14T06:18:21  <mcstar> it has no effect on that
2012-09-14T06:18:32  <mcstar> except if you change to runlevels 0,6
2012-09-14T06:18:57  <antimatroid> so sudo init 3 then sudo init 5?
2012-09-14T06:19:01  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-14T06:19:04  <antimatroid> or sudo runlevel 5?
2012-09-14T06:19:08  <mcstar> first
2012-09-14T06:19:31  <mcstar> antimatroid: and you could try other window managers
2012-09-14T06:19:58  <mcstar> what do they call it, unity?
2012-09-14T06:20:09  <mcstar> yeah, so to see if unity causes the prbolems
2012-09-14T06:20:13  <antimatroid> mcstar: nic me again
2012-09-14T06:20:14  <mcstar> or its a more general one

2012-09-14T09:06:58  <antimatroid> how do i check?
2012-09-14T09:07:00  <mcstar> i have no idea what these are called on ubuntyu
2012-09-14T09:07:06  <mcstar> but you must be able to list them
2012-09-14T09:07:12  <mcstar> either man service

2012-09-14T09:13:07  <mcstar> so? i can look that up if i want
2012-09-14T09:13:11  <mcstar> you should read it
2012-09-14T09:13:34  <mcstar> btw, --status-all is what you want
2012-09-14T09:13:50  <mcstar> if you cant pastebin service --status-all, now that would be helpful

2012-09-14T09:39:43  <antimatroidl> i wish it'd just work, i don't enjoy fucking around with this stuff
2012-09-14T09:40:09  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i dont either
2012-09-14T09:40:09  <antimatroidl> i'm very tempted to just try and reinstall the old ubuntu
2012-09-14T09:40:22  <antimatroidl> that would make my life so much better
2012-09-14T09:40:24  <mcstar> why dont you just fuck ubuntu
2012-09-14T09:40:32  <mcstar> i mean, forget about it
2012-09-14T09:40:36  <antimatroidl> and use what?
2012-09-14T09:40:42  <mcstar> arch? :)
2012-09-14T09:40:45  <antimatroidl> don't forget i'm basically retarded at linux
2012-09-14T09:40:53  <antimatroidl> and refuse to go back to windows
2012-09-14T09:41:05  <antimatroidl> i was very happy with it until my old install fucked up
2012-09-14T09:41:26  <mcstar> antimatroidl: so, stop lightdm
2012-09-14T09:41:37  <mcstar> and then try to see, if you can type into a real terminal
2012-09-14T09:41:54  <antimatroidl> "sudo stop lightdm"?
2012-09-14T09:42:00  <mcstar> maybe

2012-09-14T09:43:07  <antimatroidl> first one worked

2012-09-14T09:45:04  <antimatroidl> why did you have me do that then?
2012-09-14T09:45:05  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you could try intalling gdm, instead of lightdm
2012-09-14T09:45:13  <antimatroidl> meh
2012-09-14T09:45:20  <antimatroidl> i don't even like this ubuntu

2012-09-14T09:45:22  <antimatroidl> it's awful
2012-09-14T09:45:23  <mcstar> just as i said
