2012-09-08T02:09:10  <Icebone1000> can someone explain me the algorithm t o get the tiles at the view radius sight?
2012-09-08T02:15:03  <thestinger> Icebone1000: there are a few ways in code
2012-09-08T02:15:41  <thestinger> the slow way is to do a walk/search out from the point until the edge of the radius
2012-09-08T02:16:07  <Icebone1000> the one in the c# starter kit, I cant get it...
2012-09-08T02:16:12  <thestinger> the fast way is to precalculate the offsets (-2 y, -1 x), (-1 y, -1 x), etc.
2012-09-08T02:16:24  <thestinger> and then you paint the view radius using those offsets around every ant
2012-09-08T02:16:37  <thestinger> dunno what the C# starter does :P
2012-09-08T02:16:47  <Icebone1000> for (int row = -1 * viewRadius; row <= viewRadius; ++row)
2012-09-08T02:17:06  <thestinger> Icebone1000: does it precalculate offsets?
2012-09-08T02:17:25  <Icebone1000> yes, than check if the location is one of the offsets
2012-09-08T02:17:51  <thestinger> yeah, so it goes through something like 2 nested loops to find every offset from an ant within the radius
2012-09-08T02:18:08  <thestinger> and stores those offsets (-2, -1), (-1, -1), (-1, -2), etc.
2012-09-08T02:19:12  <Icebone1000> yes, but I dont get those maths, why -1 * radius, that entire loop doesnt fit in my brain, any link to articles on this? its not trivial is it?
2012-09-08T02:20:00  <pairofdice> It's pretty damn trivial
2012-09-08T02:20:34  <Icebone1000> why it starts at -1?
2012-09-08T02:21:56  <Icebone1000> wheres the positive offsets, to me theres notting trivial on it ._.
2012-09-08T02:25:14  <Icebone1000> by the for loop, it will start on row -1, then 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, till out of sight, but its going to the right side
2012-09-08T02:32:27  <Icebone1000> nvrmind, just got it Â¦D

2012-09-08T16:18:06  <mcstar> thestinger: did you start doing the phonebook challenge? just asking...
2012-09-08T16:18:12  <thestinger> no
2012-09-08T16:18:34  <mcstar> i finished the alg. that i wrote in c++ for antimatroid
2012-09-08T16:18:48  <mcstar> it is like 10x slower than the pretty haskell one
2012-09-08T16:18:54  <mcstar> fail
2012-09-08T16:19:05  <thestinger> probably doing a lot more work then
2012-09-08T16:19:27  <mcstar> it was supposed to be more efficient
2012-09-08T16:19:59  <mcstar> and i still think the algorithm is better
2012-09-08T16:20:23  <mcstar> but, it is possible, that haskell's lazyness help here
2012-09-08T16:20:30  <mcstar> helps*
2012-09-08T16:22:14  <mcstar> thestinger: http://hpaste.org/74446
2012-09-08T16:26:36  <mcstar> it is possible, that this has a better time complexity, but a big constant factor...
2012-09-08T16:31:17  <thestinger> mcstar: you can delete the copy constructor btw
2012-09-08T16:31:20  <thestinger> the default is fine there
2012-09-08T16:32:23  <mcstar> i wonder why did i write it
2012-09-08T16:33:05  <thestinger> ./foo  2.71s user 0.00s system 99% cpu 2.716 total
2012-09-08T16:33:07  <thestinger> on my laptop
2012-09-08T16:33:40  <mcstar> but you cant compare it to anything else
2012-09-08T16:33:51  <mcstar> its over 10 secs for me :)
2012-09-08T16:33:56  <thestinger> what's the result supposed to be?
2012-09-08T16:34:02  <mcstar> nothing
2012-09-08T16:34:11  <mcstar> the result is commented out
2012-09-08T16:34:15  <thestinger> I know :P
2012-09-08T16:34:22  <mcstar> then what do you mean?
2012-09-08T16:34:27  <thestinger> if I uncomment it
2012-09-08T16:34:34  <mcstar> another diagram
2012-09-08T16:34:52  <mcstar> antimat has this idea of parallal connected lattice points
2012-09-08T16:35:05  <mcstar> which can form a semigroup under a certain definition of multiplication
2012-09-08T16:35:10  <mcstar> (group operation)
2012-09-08T16:35:22  <mcstar> so, you give it 2 diagrams, and get a thiurd one
2012-09-08T16:38:24  <mcstar> thestinger: http://hpaste.org/74448 this is shorter, looks better, faster, and has a much better show function
2012-09-08T16:38:50  <thestinger> well then lets make it faster :P
2012-09-08T16:39:17  <mcstar> the c++ one?
2012-09-08T16:39:20  <thestinger> yes
2012-09-08T16:39:34  <mcstar> too much trouble
2012-09-08T16:39:49  <mcstar> im trying to implement a minimum cost perfect matching atm
2012-09-08T16:43:15  <mcstar> thestinger: btw, it doesnt need to be faster than the haskell one, it only needs to be faster than what antimat has currently
2012-09-08T16:44:02  <thestinger> I'm too lazy anyway
2012-09-08T16:44:30  <thestinger> I need to make a kernel module to expose fsnotify in a sane form
2012-09-08T16:45:12  <mcstar> whats that?
2012-09-08T16:45:33  <mcstar> file alternation callback mechanism?
2012-09-08T16:46:20  <mcstar> thestinger: and for what?
2012-09-08T16:46:40  <thestinger> for an always up-to-date indexing thing, like what rlocate was
2012-09-08T16:46:49  <thestinger> now a dead project that doesn't work
2012-09-08T16:47:08  <mcstar> hm, so why do you work on it?
2012-09-08T16:47:11  <mcstar> curiosity?
2012-09-08T16:47:25  <thestinger> yes, and it's also somewhat useful :P
