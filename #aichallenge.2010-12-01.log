2010-12-01T00:25:18  <burny> the games per minute has been droping like a rock lately lol
2010-12-01T00:27:00  <virdo> but the games we play rising :)
2010-12-01T00:28:28  <sigh> oh, player cutoff is nearly at 1000
2010-12-01T00:30:01  <burny> roughly 10games per hour now?
2010-12-01T00:32:17  <sigh> should be close to that, yeah
2010-12-01T00:32:52  <davidjliu> asavis has climbed quite a bit since yesterday
2010-12-01T00:33:08  <antimatroid> i'm not helping^^
2010-12-01T00:33:23  <antimatroid> i think i have one of the most expensive bots
2010-12-01T00:33:27  <antimatroid> if not the
2010-12-01T00:33:40  <burny> lets see.. to make the top10 ranks be fairly stable, with their current elo ratings as an indicator.. they need something like 20k games each?

2010-12-01T00:34:00  <burny> which would be around a million games for the top 100
2010-12-01T00:34:04  <antimatroid> i think the rankings have gone quite well
2010-12-01T00:35:09  <burny> which is roughly 10days of just the top100 playing?

2010-12-01T00:37:29  <burny> so the top10 bots, are going to be off by an average of probably around 5elo, and so most likely, 2 or 3 of them will be out of order
2010-12-01T00:37:35  <burny> since we only have a day left
2010-12-01T00:38:16  <burny> since the nature of the game, is subject to randomness.. this shouldn't matter though
2010-12-01T00:38:47  <antimatroid> nope, it's close enough for me
2010-12-01T00:39:09  <burny> and the most important thing, the first place.. seems fairly obvious
2010-12-01T00:39:18  *** sanddbox <sanddbox!~emu1212@cpe-98-155-50-150.san.res.rr.com> has quit IRC ()
2010-12-01T00:39:18  <antimatroid> given the nature of the game and the number of bots, it's sort of got to be expected a little bit
2010-12-01T00:39:27  <antimatroid> yep, imo 2 is obvious too
2010-12-01T00:39:45  <virdo> Isn't a million too much? player combination x maps? Would it be 100 * 50 * 150 games in total for round robin across 150 maps?
2010-12-01T00:40:37  <antimatroid> i beat slin and accoun in my last two games
2010-12-01T00:40:45  <burny> that playing each map once, isn't sufficient
2010-12-01T00:41:05  <virdo> wait -- why would you want same pairings of bots to replay the same map?
2010-12-01T00:41:18  <davidjliu> antimatroid: good for you! and for me, seeing that I have misguided goals of still reaching the top 10 :)
2010-12-01T00:41:20  <burny> well, ideally not the same map

2010-12-01T00:42:13  <antimatroid> davidjliu: i don't think you're knocking either of those two out of the top ten :P
2010-12-01T00:42:25  <davidjliu> clearly you are :)
2010-12-01T00:42:36  <antimatroid> i'm actually about on par with accouns bot
2010-12-01T00:42:43  <virdo> that's why it's a round robin across all maps ;) -- if we take top 50, would it be 50 x 25 x 150? (50 x 25 for pairing people up, 150 for maps)
2010-12-01T00:42:56  <burny> 1000000 games, for the top100, would be statistically approxiamtly the number of games required to make their scores converge(relative to each other), given an infinte supply of maps
2010-12-01T00:42:58  <antimatroid> when it's just the two of us that is

2010-12-01T00:44:29  <burny> virdo.. how many spoons would you have to throw out the window.. to determine which side lands up more often(concave, or convex)

2010-12-01T00:45:40  <burny> oh, how many times do you need to slip a penny.. to determine if one side is heavier than the other?
2010-12-01T00:45:40  <davidjliu> burny: I think it's fairly safe to say that if two bots play on the same map twice, they will almost always get the same result
2010-12-01T00:46:02  <burny> david, for most bots, yes, most likely
2010-12-01T00:46:09  <virdo> burny: I'm not sure what you're getting at :) -- All I was saying is: if there are 100 maps... and you take top 50 bots... to play all bots against each other on every map... I'm not sure what issue there is here :)
2010-12-01T00:46:31  <antimatroid> i think the point is we'd use more maps
2010-12-01T00:46:39  <burny> virdo, what I'm saying is.. that's not sufficient to make the scores converge
2010-12-01T00:46:48  <davidjliu> yeah, if we used more maps, then that'd be an issue, but with 100, it's a limited population
2010-12-01T00:46:53  <davidjliu> er, 150
2010-12-01T00:47:10  <virdo> I'm not talking about scores / elos right now... I'm more thinking about pure wins / losses / draws calculation ;)
2010-12-01T00:48:17  <virdo> Wouldn't it be enough to pit every top bot against every other top bot across a slew of maps and sort based on wins descending?
2010-12-01T00:48:38  <burny> not really..
2010-12-01T00:48:38  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3816), _iouri_(3620), Slin-.-(3576), jimrogerz(3568), _Astek_(3562), asavis(3546), GreenTea(3546), Accoun(3543), protocolocon(3538), george(3531)
2010-12-01T00:49:00  <burny> but the whole nature of how we're testing the bots, isn't truely indicitive.. but it's close enough that no one really cares
2010-12-01T00:49:10  <burny> in particular, the top bots, are not playing against many weak bots
2010-12-01T00:49:50  <burny> so if a bot wins against 99% of rank 1-100 bots, but only 80% of rank 101-4500 bots.. it'll win over one that beats 98% of everyone
2010-12-01T00:50:10  <virdo> but why would top bots need to play weak bots? they already proved themselves, no?
2010-12-01T00:50:30  <burny> yes.. they proved themselves better then the weak bot..
2010-12-01T00:50:43  <burny> but the didn't prove themselves better than other top bots, at beating weak bots
2010-12-01T00:51:17  <burny> if you beat EVERYone 60% of the time.. are you going to win?
2010-12-01T00:51:31  <virdo> yeah, well, if we lived in a world with no resource limitations, I would agree with you... Reason round robin across all bots / 99999 maps isn't being played out is because of this limitation...
2010-12-01T00:51:34  <burny> clearly not.. but if you beat everyone 60% of the time.. who is better than you?
2010-12-01T00:53:59  *** smloh1 <smloh1!4786e1ca@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.134.225.202> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2010-12-01T00:55:20  <burny> if some bot beats bosco 100% of the time.. but only beats the other rank 1-100 bots 49% of the time.. it's going to not be in the top100
2010-12-01T00:57:36  <virdo> I'm not actually sure what your argument is -- are you saying that round robin across all players and all maps is unfair? or are you saying that including only top players in this round robin is unfair?
2010-12-01T00:57:55  <burny> no, I'm saying it's not statistically sufficient
2010-12-01T00:58:10  <burny> oh..
2010-12-01T00:58:19  <burny> I guess, only top players, is slightly unfair
2010-12-01T00:58:41  <burny> but it probably doesn't matter much
2010-12-01T00:58:55  <burny> that it's not worth the processing time, to determine it's level of relevance
2010-12-01T00:59:40  <virdo> Why wouldn't it be statistically sufficient?
2010-12-01T01:00:19  <virdo> We're not talking about all these bot pairings playing on just one map... I agree, that would be biased... but 150 maps is still not enough?
2010-12-01T01:00:28  <burny> the same reason why it's hard to determine how many times you need to flip a coin, to determine which side is heavier
2010-12-01T01:01:38  <virdo> What's your math here for it not being "statistically sufficient"?
2010-12-01T01:01:54  <burny> it's based on elo
2010-12-01T01:02:23  <burny> given 2 events, with 1 being 1% more likely than the other..
2010-12-01T01:02:41  <burny> er.. 2 outcomes to an event
2010-12-01T01:03:25  <burny> if you run the event 100 times.. it's only 50% likely to end up with 1 of them, having more wins than the other
2010-12-01T01:03:59  <virdo> Maybe a different analogy here will do better, rather than flipping coins :) -- Let's say it's people racing on a race track... Everyone races against everyone... How in the world isn't the person who wins most races the best? :)
2010-12-01T01:04:29  <virdo> They might have had a bad run on some race track against another runner, but generally they're still the best...
2010-12-01T01:04:32  <burny> because of luck?
2010-12-01T01:04:48  <virdo> ok, that's why there are 150 race tracks :)
2010-12-01T01:04:54  <burny> generall.. more likely to be the best, given the data available
2010-12-01T01:05:22  <burny> well, generaly in a race.. people are significantly stronger/weaker than the others
2010-12-01T01:06:08  <virdo> but luck factor is also there -- liek not feeling well, spraining an ankle, whatever...
2010-12-01T01:06:51  <burny> if you look at the ELO's.. it right now suugests that if you take the 3rd place, and 10th place bots.. that the 4th place one will win roughly 56% of the games
2010-12-01T01:09:14  <burny> given a 56% chance of winning, the odds of winning 75 or less games, out of 150, is roughly.. 2%
2010-12-01T01:09:44  <burny> so there's a 2% chance, that the ranks will be off by up to 6 places
2010-12-01T01:10:07  <kincody> I have noticed that players get pitched with the same opponent very often.. is this because the round robin confines you to play only with bots whose "Turns to next game" matches yours?  Or is it because of the Rank belt that we get to play against?...
2010-12-01T01:10:43  <burny> kincody: it mostly matches you only against people with similar rank as yourself
2010-12-01T01:10:57  <burny> so generally teh same 100 or so opponents
2010-12-01T01:11:29  <virdo> burny, you're still on the ELO -- I would say ELO did an awesome job getting us the top players -- I'm still not clear how you can claim round robin across all maps with top N players wouldn't be "good enough" -- but maybe I'm just stuck in my own world :)

2010-12-01T01:16:05  <burny> the pairing for final, takes the bot which has least games played.. not the bot which has played least recently
2010-12-01T01:17:39  <kincody> but is there not a fixed no of players? so wont it be periodic? hence confining you to a group of players?
2010-12-01T01:18:18  <burny> no
2010-12-01T01:18:28  <burny> it doesn't take BOTH players who have played least

2010-12-01T05:40:22  <mega1> in about 13 hours I think
2010-12-01T05:42:37  <rabidus_> right.. so it's 02 am here

2010-12-01T05:55:19  <antimatroid1> mega1: is there a favourite thing of yours explaining how UCT is actually done?
2010-12-01T05:55:50  <mega1> antimatroid1: not really. Error323 asked this question yesterday.
2010-12-01T05:56:14  <antimatroid1> i don't really get it :P, ah well
2010-12-01T06:00:01  <antimatroid1> how would one hash an arimaa board? i can't really get a number 64 digits long represented in base x, plus i think i'd want more than 10 bases
2010-12-01T06:00:32  <antimatroid1> i probably don't have the correct understanding of what a hash is, but i might
2010-12-01T06:01:14  <Error323> perhaps you wanna take a look at bitboards
2010-12-01T06:05:48  <sigh> antimatroid1: maybe look at something like this for hashing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zobrist_hashing
2010-12-01T06:07:24  <antimatroid1> isn't that sort of just representing the board as a b based number like i said above?
2010-12-01T06:07:42  <sigh> it's nothing like that o_O
2010-12-01T06:08:22  <Error323> antimatroid1: yes sort of, you represent e.g. the moves of a single piece in a bitboard
2010-12-01T06:08:43  <sigh> oh ok, you were talking to Error323
2010-12-01T06:08:46  <Error323> which can be done in 64 bit
2010-12-01T06:08:51  <Error323> 8x8
2010-12-01T06:09:18  <Error323> and then you can apply logical operators to apply moves quickly and determine states

2010-12-01T07:40:24  <antimatroid1> induction starts at a and then assumes it hodls for n>=a, shows n+1 holds, then that says it holds for all n>=a

2010-12-01T07:40:32  <antimatroid1> i'm not seeing the equivalence :\
2010-12-01T07:40:47  <sigh> recursion is used for algorithms, induction for proofs

2010-12-01T07:56:23  <delt0r_> antimatroid1: induction is a proof because of repeated application of the fact that n+1 is true and that if its true for n=1 then its also true for any positive integer because i can repeatedly apply the n+1
2010-12-01T07:57:31  <Migi32> wow, these rankings... Are you writing a post-mortem yet, mega1?
2010-12-01T07:57:37  <delt0r_> so its looping
2010-12-01T07:57:51  <delt0r_> and looping == recursion
2010-12-01T07:57:54  <delt0r_> qed
2010-12-01T07:57:58  <delt0r_> ;)
2010-12-01T07:58:22  <Error323> looping < recursion
2010-12-01T07:58:27  <delt0r_> wow getting quite heavy snow now....
2010-12-01T07:58:29  <delt0r_> lol
2010-12-01T07:59:02  <Error323> any loop can be written with recursion, but not every recursion can be written in a loop
2010-12-01T07:59:04  <delt0r_> Error323: all recursions can be writen as loops and also the other way round
2010-12-01T07:59:13  <delt0r_> yes it can
2010-12-01T07:59:17  <Error323> oh?
2010-12-01T07:59:29  <delt0r_> you just have an explicit stack
2010-12-01T07:59:47  <delt0r_> ie you do the stack thing yourself

2010-12-01T08:02:34  <sigh> unwinding?
2010-12-01T08:02:43  <antimatroid1> i avoid recursion when i can
2010-12-01T08:02:43  <pyro-> pop
2010-12-01T08:02:54  <antimatroid1> or not being lazy
2010-12-01T08:03:07  <delt0r_> exactly pyro-
2010-12-01T08:03:35  <delt0r_> push and pop--what function calling does under the hood
2010-12-01T08:03:45  <delt0r_> doing some asm helps here...
2010-12-01T08:03:57  <delt0r_> antimatroid1, Sometimes its the right tool for the job
2010-12-01T08:04:02  <delt0r_> other times its not
2010-12-01T08:04:20  <antimatroid1> asm?

2010-12-01T08:04:29  <sigh> antimatroid1: you avoid recursion and you are learning haskell?

2010-12-01T08:05:03  <antimatroid1> i don't dislike recursion
2010-12-01T08:05:06  <delt0r_> in older assmblers at least you have to do the push and poping yourself...
2010-12-01T08:05:15  <antimatroid1> i've just been told it's bad to do that over the alternative where it's easy?
2010-12-01T08:05:17  <antimatroid1> is that wrong?
2010-12-01T08:05:23  <Epona> yes
2010-12-01T08:05:23  <delt0r_> more modern cpus have instructions for it
2010-12-01T08:05:37  <delt0r_> ??
2010-12-01T08:05:56  <delt0r_> if a loop is more natrual...fine... but if recursion... then use it imo
2010-12-01T08:06:13  <delt0r_> In java at least recursion has about the same performance as a loop
2010-12-01T08:06:15  <mega1> ouch, my longest winning streak ended
2010-12-01T08:06:40  <pyro-> an iterative form rarely seems the most natural when you have an implementation of scheme
2010-12-01T08:06:46  <delt0r_> don't know about other langs... would expect C/C++ stack frames to be quite light however
2010-12-01T08:06:56  <delt0r_> x86 don't have a lot of registers
2010-12-01T08:07:29  <sigh> recursion kills python though... that kind of sucks
2010-12-01T08:07:32  <delt0r_> pyro-, yea---well lisp has "loop"
2010-12-01T08:07:38  * antimatroid1 doesn't know much past treating compilers like a big black box that do magic for me and what i learn about different languages
2010-12-01T08:08:03  <Epona> recursion kills python? wat
2010-12-01T08:08:03  <pyro-> delt0r_, scheme has DO, but it doesn't see much use
2010-12-01T08:08:20  <sigh> antimatroid1: it's more about understanding what a function call actually *does*
2010-12-01T08:08:36  <delt0r_> but scheme must to the "tail recursive" thing right?
2010-12-01T08:08:43  <sigh> if you get that, then you will understand how to translate bw recursion and iteration
2010-12-01T08:08:43  <pyro-> Epona, the reference python interpreter is always running out of stack space when you write recursive functions
2010-12-01T08:08:55  <pyro-> delt0r_, yes, they have to optimise that
2010-12-01T08:09:01  <Epona> example
2010-12-01T08:09:08  <Error323> oh no, the flagcapper is gaining territory

2010-12-01T08:11:22  <delt0r_> if you need scalability --then converting recursion to loops is "accepted" wisdom

2010-12-01T08:12:06  <pyro-> (nor useful)
2010-12-01T08:12:24  <delt0r_> well tail recursion is the same thing... no stack frames
2010-12-01T08:12:49  <sigh> s(1000) is larger than the default recursion limit for python

2010-12-01T08:14:52  <delt0r_> wow --same on mine
2010-12-01T08:15:37  <sigh> even if you increase it, the frames for python are huge and no tail optimisation

2010-12-01T10:32:20  <Error323> hey :)
2010-12-01T10:32:24  <Error323> nice article

2010-12-01T10:32:40  <iouri> hey
2010-12-01T10:32:44  <iouri> thanks!
2010-12-01T10:33:50  <iouri> Neverstu also has a pretty neat article, describes things in a lot more detail than me: http://reactorsoftware.com/blog/?p=24
2010-12-01T10:33:59  <Error323> yeah read that too
2010-12-01T10:34:21  <Error323> mega1's (bocsimacko's) is comming out tomorrow
2010-12-01T10:34:21  <Error323> =)
2010-12-01T10:34:37  <iouri> I was concerned that if I started going in-depth into my source code, the article would be 5x as long as it is
2010-12-01T10:34:48  <iouri> can't wait, would be an interesting read:)
2010-12-01T10:34:57  <Error323> heh yeh, I examined your src code
2010-12-01T10:35:07  <Error323> nice and clean
2010-12-01T10:35:13  <Error323> well compared to my jibberish =)
2010-12-01T10:35:36  <Error323> I liked it
2010-12-01T10:35:37  *** nullkuhl <nullkuhl!~nullkuhl@196.221.228.108> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-12-01T10:37:21  <iouri> lol, "nice and clean"?  I guess it might be to a degree.. It has a lot of useless stuff in it, out of date comments, and way too many #ifdef conditions
2010-12-01T10:38:03  <Error323> well ifdefs mostly for submission
2010-12-01T10:39:03  <Error323> I was always very curious as to how ppl evaluated actinos
2010-12-01T10:39:06  <Error323> actions*
2010-12-01T10:39:12  <Error323> as this was my biggest issue
2010-12-01T10:39:17  <Error323> i tried alphabeta
2010-12-01T10:39:23  <Error323> but couldn't get it right
2010-12-01T10:39:33  <Error323> evaluation-wise
2010-12-01T10:39:47  <iouri> Hm..  Yeah, I think tree-based searches just don't work as well in this game
2010-12-01T10:39:58  *** nullkuhl <nullkuhl!~nullkuhl@196.221.228.108> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-01T10:40:15  <delt0r_> I must admit that bocsimacko code is quite clean with really good comments
2010-12-01T10:40:37  <delt0r_> iouri, I though your code was not bad either
2010-12-01T10:40:49  <delt0r_> for c++ :p (
2010-12-01T10:40:52  <delt0r_> :D
2010-12-01T10:40:59  <iouri> heh
2010-12-01T10:41:09  <Error323> i wish bocsimacko's code was c++ hehe
2010-12-01T10:41:22  <delt0r_> lisp is not so hard to read
2010-12-01T10:41:31  <Error323> it is
2010-12-01T10:41:36  <delt0r_> I hadn't done it for years...
2010-12-01T10:41:43  <Error323> `,'((())))()()(())))(((())

2010-12-01T10:41:50  <Error323> w.t.f. stuff
2010-12-01T10:41:51  <Error323> =)
2010-12-01T10:41:51  <delt0r_> yet could follow the code just by looking up the convections
2010-12-01T10:42:17  <delt0r_> Error323, C++ does that too -- {[][]()[]((()))([])}
2010-12-01T10:42:31  <Error323> less
2010-12-01T10:42:46  <delt0r_> formatting convenctions are different... but easy to get use too
2010-12-01T10:42:51  <Error323> but i'm not bothered by that by it that much
2010-12-01T10:43:03  <delt0r_> just track the indentation
2010-12-01T10:43:09  <Error323> what annoys me is the ',` stuff
2010-12-01T10:43:21  <delt0r_> and view () as "making it easy for the parser"
2010-12-01T10:43:22  <Error323> ',`#* even
2010-12-01T10:43:38  <delt0r_> oh- well thats kind of important
2010-12-01T10:43:49  <Error323> ye i figured that :P
2010-12-01T10:43:53  <delt0r_> bit like all the <T> stuff in C++
2010-12-01T10:43:53  <iouri> I didn't get around to looking at his code yet mostly because I'm too lazy to look at anything that's not browsable directly online
2010-12-01T10:44:26  <delt0r_> and the & * stuff in C/C++
2010-12-01T10:44:44  <iouri> And the iterators are waay to wordy
2010-12-01T10:44:51  <iouri> too much typing
2010-12-01T10:45:12  <Error323> and frowned upon it seems
2010-12-01T10:45:31  <delt0r_> ?? you mean STL iterators?
2010-12-01T10:45:36  <iouri> yeah
2010-12-01T10:45:39  <antimatroid> iouri: i got you a few times with my game tree :P
2010-12-01T10:45:50  <antimatroid> and on tcp
2010-12-01T10:45:59  <antimatroid> the final tree i uploaded is broken as all hell

2010-12-01T10:46:15  <iouri> hm.  There's a chance then that I didn't approach the game tree correctly
2010-12-01T10:46:36  <Error323> I beat it 49 out of 150 :P
2010-12-01T10:47:03  <antimatroid> in a couple of lines, my moves were vectors of fleets all with the same destination, but different sources and send times, then at each node i made 1 move per player, and sort of planed out moves for any point in time
2010-12-01T10:47:10  <antimatroid> then i built the game tree off that
2010-12-01T10:47:32  <janzert> iouri: you can browse mega1's source online at http://quotenil.com/git/?p=planet-wars.git
2010-12-01T10:47:32  <antimatroid> it wasn't very good though :P
2010-12-01T10:48:00  <Error323> yea, though i rlly hate that browser
2010-12-01T10:48:03  <Error323> github ftw

2010-12-01T10:48:59  <delt0r_> well ones thing is for sure
2010-12-01T10:49:17  <janzert> click on commit next to the final checkin and the important files are way down at the bottom of that page

2010-12-01T10:49:49  <janzert> Error323: yeah, that browser is certainly not as nice as github
2010-12-01T10:50:14  <antimatroid> even i went to the effort of getting amstan to put mine on github :P

2010-12-01T10:54:40  <antimatroid> i tended to use more secretive names most of the time

2010-12-01T10:58:48  <antimatroid> weird win
2010-12-01T10:59:01  <Error323> I've got this strategy that just sends every ship when I attack (unless I was closest), because i found it to be very hard to predict what to send.
2010-12-01T10:59:24  <Error323> Now darthmasta has an annoying antistrategy for it
2010-12-01T10:59:37  <Error323> he just swaps planet with me -.- and wins because of that lol
2010-12-01T10:59:54  <antimatroid> Error323: i sent exactly enough to take it if they sent everything
2010-12-01T11:00:17  <antimatroid> same with expanding, on first round defense moves i think i just cancelled out their attacks though
2010-12-01T11:00:22  <Error323> he does it after i send it
2010-12-01T11:00:52  <Error323> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9509970
2010-12-01T11:00:53  <antimatroid> i'd also plan my moves up to time "maxdistance" for any planet
2010-12-01T11:01:19  <JamesMG> at one point mine was set up to send every possible ship from a planet only if the target was higher growth
2010-12-01T11:01:19  <antimatroid> why send so much?
2010-12-01T11:01:33  <JamesMG> intending to trade and then move back with the extra ships
2010-12-01T11:01:42  <Error323> because at the moment of sending it becomes my new frontline -,-
2010-12-01T11:01:48  <Error323> but then he flips planet
2010-12-01T11:01:50  <antimatroid> admitidely my move selection functions are GROSS
2010-12-01T11:01:53  <Error323> and its not anymore

2010-12-01T11:14:36  <phreeza> that was my weakness i think... tried to come up with something sensible, but in the end i just sampled the entire space of possible moves uniformly
2010-12-01T11:14:49  <antimatroid> phreeza: my pick move function is horrible inefficient
2010-12-01T11:14:57  <phreeza> which is quite terrible, but for some reason anything "smart" i tried was worse
2010-12-01T11:15:10  <phreeza> a lot better than mine... :)
2010-12-01T11:15:18  <antimatroid> and i have nothing to make planets safe other than for incoming fleets
2010-12-01T11:15:49  <antimatroid> the code for that is all fine except makeChildren in tree.cc is really really broken

2010-12-01T11:17:35  <GreenTea> rating is disappear
2010-12-01T11:17:41  <GreenTea> on user pages..
2010-12-01T11:17:42  <rebelxt> xrillo is UCTing as well but he did not post source
2010-12-01T11:18:04  <phreeza> ah yes :( no more ratings
2010-12-01T11:18:12  <antimatroid> phreeza: what i was trying to do at the end with my tree was only add moves for me if after checking their moves I could do at least as well as if i considered doing nothing
2010-12-01T11:18:16  <antimatroid> but i messed it up terrible
2010-12-01T11:18:23  <rebelxt> ratings reset incoming? ;-)
2010-12-01T11:18:44  <phreeza> i'm 1286 :D
2010-12-01T11:18:53  <antimatroid> the biggest problem with my bot is the number of layers for me i generate is the max number of "actual" moves i'll make each turn, which is usually like 1 or 2, the rest of my fleets are all bluff carrying out other orders
2010-12-01T11:19:13  <antimatroid> terribly* damnit!
2010-12-01T11:19:21  <antimatroid> i made that mistake too many times in the last ten minutes
2010-12-01T11:19:59  <Error323> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9523367 dohhhhhh
2010-12-01T11:20:04  <phreeza> oh, n_layers = n_moves?
2010-12-01T11:20:07  <phreeza> weird
2010-12-01T11:20:35  <antimatroid> well i could have picked out 3 moves per "turn" at each node etc. but i couldn't work out how to correctly pick out moves that were jointly feasible
2010-12-01T11:20:44  <antimatroid> and i liked having my tree "string" moves together
2010-12-01T11:21:17  <antimatroid> but once a map has many claimable planets on the first turn, it's crippled
2010-12-01T11:21:31  <meneky_> anyone knows why the ranking positions have disappear from the profile pages?
2010-12-01T11:22:22  <meneky_> they are back
2010-12-01T11:22:22  <janzert> they're back now, but frozen along with the leaderboard until final results are released this evening
2010-12-01T11:23:05  <meneky_> positions and elos have been frozen?
2010-12-01T11:23:09  <Error323> janzert: you mean the contest has now stopped? or has become invisible?
2010-12-01T11:23:30  <janzert> you just won't see any updates in the ranking or elos
2010-12-01T11:23:39  <janzert> internally they are still being updated the same
2010-12-01T11:23:41  <meneky_> perfect torture

2010-12-01T11:24:26  <janzert> sorry this was the compromise I worked with Jeff yesterday :P
2010-12-01T11:24:41  <meneky_> ok
2010-12-01T11:24:47  <Error323> and so when will it stop theN?
2010-12-01T11:24:58  <janzert> if he had his way you wouldn't get to see anything and could just sit and stew :)
2010-12-01T11:25:04  <antimatroid> menekey_: it took some persuasion just to have the contest be live for this long :P
2010-12-01T11:25:09  <janzert> but I didn't want to listen to all the screaming
2010-12-01T11:25:11  <Error323> its 3 more elo between me and mistmanov if he wins
2010-12-01T11:25:14  <Error323> i'll kill him

2010-12-01T11:26:47  <antimatroid> i've had quite a few, i thought he'd be better

2010-12-01T11:28:20  <antimatroid> that's an hour fast^^
2010-12-01T11:28:29  <Error323> so that's in like 7.5 hours?
2010-12-01T11:28:37  <antimatroid> :P
2010-12-01T11:28:40  <antimatroid> it says pm
2010-12-01T11:28:43  <antimatroid> and that's am
2010-12-01T11:28:47  <antimatroid> so 19.5?
2010-12-01T11:29:22  <medrimonia> 23h for us Error323^^
2010-12-01T11:29:28  <iouri> 7.5, i think
2010-12-01T11:29:31  <antimatroid> the sooner the better for me, it's not going up :P
2010-12-01T11:29:35  <janzert> about 7.5 hours from now
2010-12-01T11:29:40  <antimatroid> oh, i am retarded :P

2010-12-01T11:32:45  <rebelxt> Meatkat: hi! ;-)
2010-12-01T11:32:47  <Meatkat> Sorry, used to hang out here a lot, but then had to study for the GREs....
2010-12-01T11:32:58  <antimatroid> oh god, i am going to do them next year
2010-12-01T11:33:08  <antimatroid> how was the maths one? (assuming you did that one)
2010-12-01T11:33:18  <antimatroid> people on reddit said it was brutalish
2010-12-01T11:33:26  <Meatkat> Now I'm hoping I can cling in the top100, now at 81 or something like that
2010-12-01T11:33:32  <Error323> GRE's?
2010-12-01T11:33:38  <Meatkat> Maths dominates your face if you don't study
2010-12-01T11:33:39  <Error323> what is that
2010-12-01T11:33:45  <antimatroid> general exams before grad school
2010-12-01T11:33:45  <Meatkat> I'm taking that one in April
2010-12-01T11:33:49  <Error323> aha
2010-12-01T11:33:59  <antimatroid> yeah i plan to do a fair bit of study
2010-12-01T11:34:05  <antimatroid> apparently it has a lot more analysis than algebra :(
2010-12-01T11:34:06  <Meatkat> this was just the general one though, I wanted to up my score so I memorized like 3000 vocab words before the test
2010-12-01T11:34:13  <iouri> lol
2010-12-01T11:34:42  <Error323> we have a very different system here
2010-12-01T11:34:54  <Meatkat> I has EVERYTHING you did/could/should study in undergrad including topology, real analysis, linear algebra, complex analysis, and more
2010-12-01T11:34:59  <antimatroid> Error323: we don't have them for australia, but i have dreams of mit :P

2010-12-01T11:36:00  <Meatkat> I took it once at the end of my undergrad and thought they'd be a joke like the SAT/ACT/General GRE but they pwn3d my face... and my face doesn't usually get pwn3d by standardized tests
2010-12-01T11:36:41  <Error323> lol
2010-12-01T11:36:49  <antimatroid> yeah, i have got the message to take it seriously
2010-12-01T11:37:12  <Meatkat> antimatroid: I'd recommend picking up the Princeton Review for studying, when are you planning on taking it?
2010-12-01T11:37:30  <antimatroid> next year, planning to grab that
2010-12-01T11:37:57  <antimatroid> i just finished undergrad in cs, eco and maths, doing honours in maths next year, masters in maths after that, then i'm not even sure what to do a phd in if i do it
2010-12-01T11:38:02  <antimatroid> something game theory related :P
2010-12-01T11:38:30  <Error323> so you can pwn those ai contests ;)
2010-12-01T11:38:44  <antimatroid> nah, i'm more interested in the pure side if i do that
2010-12-01T11:38:47  <Meatkat> Cool, did my undergrad in math and cs, in the Peace Corps now, off to do a masters in Econ next year then a PhD in AI
2010-12-01T11:39:07  <antimatroid> what kind of eco?
2010-12-01T11:39:21  <antimatroid> micro theory is pretty much all i enjoy
2010-12-01T11:39:33  <antimatroid> although i work as an ra doing programming stuff for a macroeconomist

2010-12-01T11:40:54  <antimatroid> take the post grad theory courses for micro and macro if they'll let you :)
2010-12-01T11:40:57  <antimatroid> those will be the most fun
2010-12-01T11:41:31  <antimatroid> i've done a post grad micro course, and i sat through a measure theory one this semester, although i sort of stopped paying much attention towards the end because of ai, so i need to go through and learn the material properly at some point
2010-12-01T11:41:32  <Meatkat> Cool, I'll keep that in mind

2010-12-01T11:55:40  <davidjliu> does anyone know why they aren't planning on lowering the cutoff more?
2010-12-01T11:56:12  <davidjliu> cause 11/12/13 have slowly been inching their ways toward the top 10
2010-12-01T11:56:22  <davidjliu> key word slowly
2010-12-01T11:56:37  <Meatkat> They aren't planning on lowering at anymore? Sad.

2010-12-01T11:57:24  <GreenTea> The End? )
2010-12-01T11:57:24  <Error323> :P
2010-12-01T11:57:41  <rebelxt> why did ratings get frozen for next 7 hours?
2010-12-01T11:57:49  <davidjliu> wait, they froze it for super-suspense? heh
2010-12-01T11:57:56  <Error323> davidjliu: yes
2010-12-01T11:58:07  <Error323> that would be my guess
2010-12-01T11:58:08  <GreenTea> hoho
2010-12-01T11:58:15  <antimatroid> it was originally meant to be total suspense since the end of submissions :P
2010-12-01T11:58:16  <davidjliu> when was it frozen?
2010-12-01T11:58:19  <antimatroid> imagine how painful that would be
2010-12-01T11:58:27  <antimatroid> davidjliu: like an hour ago maybe?
2010-12-01T11:58:40  <davidjliu> hopefully after dmj's winning streak... heh
2010-12-01T11:59:19  <rebelxt> so what's the reason partial suspense is needed? just curious since this can't affect me at all

2010-12-01T12:01:40  <davidjliu> I still don't get why the cutoff isn't going to be lowered though
2010-12-01T12:02:15  <Error323> well.. some of the players have high risk strategies that work well against good players but bad against worse players
2010-12-01T12:02:27  <Error323> so imo its good the cutoff is as it is
2010-12-01T12:02:58  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm fine with the cutoff
2010-12-01T12:03:10  <mega1> I'd really like to see Xrillo's source.
2010-12-01T12:03:15  <GreenTea> rabelxt: maybe for more fast playing of games. When ratings are recalculated all games should be stoped isn't it?
2010-12-01T12:03:30  <rebelxt> mega1: same here
2010-12-01T12:03:36  <davidjliu> I mean, I think taking the cutoff up to 250 wouldn't effect any of the top bots seeing as they don't play anyone outside of the top 250... and more games is always useful
2010-12-01T12:04:03  <Error323> davidjliu: it does affect it
2010-12-01T12:04:07  <mega1> #40 is quite high with uct
2010-12-01T12:04:28  <antimatroid> isn't uct meant to be good?
2010-12-01T12:04:32  <rebelxt> GreenTea: not sure if they ever stopped games to re-calculate ratings. bayeselo is fast
2010-12-01T12:04:35  <antimatroid> everyone expects it to do badly?
2010-12-01T12:07:19  <Error323> rebelxt: janzert said it takes about 8 mins to calculate
2010-12-01T12:08:57  <rebelxt> Error323: ahh got it
2010-12-01T12:10:32  <mega1> antimatroid: I gave upon it before starting to code.
2010-12-01T12:11:15  <Error323> mega1: so how would one map UCT to this problem
2010-12-01T12:11:16  <rebelxt> then maybe my bot manages to sneak back into top50 like it did every day before today ;-)
2010-12-01T12:11:51  <mega1> Error323: I couldn't see a promising way that's why I'm interested in Xrillo's approach.

2010-12-01T12:14:52  <rebelxt> i.e. it would not challenge my best heuristic bot

2010-12-01T12:21:26  <bhasker> on the post

2010-12-01T12:23:19  <rebelxt> bhasker: he did not it appears
2010-12-01T12:24:56  <Meatkat> Has anyone said that they've been using anything other than a mess/majority of heuristics?
2010-12-01T12:25:34  <Error323> whilest reading some more about minimax during these months and about naish equilibrium, isn't minimax a special method of computing the naish equilibrium?
2010-12-01T12:26:20  <Error323> i tried alphabeta
2010-12-01T12:26:39  <Error323> but if I only could read those blogs beforehand it would've worked :P
2010-12-01T12:26:47  <Meatkat> I'd say that mini-max isn't assured to find a max equilibrium, but it is possible that it finds it. Depends on the complexity/rules of the game
2010-12-01T12:26:48  <Error323> couldn't come up with a good eval functino
2010-12-01T12:27:17  <Error323> Meatkat: why isn't it assured?
2010-12-01T12:27:27  <Error323> assuming it can go all the way down of course
2010-12-01T12:28:50  <mega1> Error323: that paper is basically where UCT was born
2010-12-01T12:29:08  <mega1> (two hungarian authors)
2010-12-01T12:29:27  <Error323> yeah I read that
2010-12-01T12:29:29  <Error323> cool :)
2010-12-01T12:29:40  <Error323> thats why you grok it? =)
2010-12-01T12:30:56  <Error323> it seems like a combination between reinforcement learning and minimax
2010-12-01T12:31:20  <Meatkat> Error323: can't think of a counter-example off the top of my head... just doesn't seem like it would be true, Nash equilibria aren't very easy to find, especially when things get increasingly complex
2010-12-01T12:34:37  <Meatkat> but *if* you can assume that your mini-max can cover the whole search space... maybe? it seems like there would be a chance of accidentally pruning something. Also not many non-trivial problems are left that mini-max could step through in a reasonable amount of time
2010-12-01T12:34:55  <Error323> minimax doesn't prune

2010-12-01T12:36:08  <Meatkat> You look at your next possible moves, choose the state with the max utitily, look at your opponents possible moves (given that you've made that move), choose the one that minimizes your utility function
2010-12-01T12:36:20  <Meatkat> correct?
2010-12-01T12:36:30  <Meatkat> and so on....
2010-12-01T12:36:38  <Error323> you chose on the recursive unwind
2010-12-01T12:36:42  <Error323> not on the way down
2010-12-01T12:38:37  <JamesMG> the way I implemented it, it followed each top level node to the end and then presented that final game state
2010-12-01T12:38:52  <JamesMG> chose the best out of that bunch
2010-12-01T12:39:52  <JamesMG> it was a nasty recursive method, it took a lot of time to execute
2010-12-01T12:40:26  <Error323> well i got my implementation in the "alphabeta" branch on github, its pretty fast

2010-12-01T12:48:47  <antimatroid> Meatkat: it's possible to exploit minimax
2010-12-01T12:48:50  <Meatkat> Error323: You're right, in zero-sum games the minimax solution is the same as the Nash equilibrium.
2010-12-01T12:48:52  <antimatroid> looking at matching pennies
2010-12-01T12:49:24  <Error323> cool :) i'm not crazy then =)
2010-12-01T12:49:28  <antimatroid> i tried to do a simultaneous game where i'd pick out pure strategy nash equilibria or try to approximate a mixed strategy nash equilibria if no such pure one existed, but wasn't going to happen
2010-12-01T12:50:02  <antimatroid> unless you correctly randomise over choices in your tree
2010-12-01T12:50:33  <antimatroid> but my game tree is the best i came to anything non pure heuristics
2010-12-01T12:51:06  <antimatroid> i could release my old code if anyone was interested? that has the pure strategy stuff but there's LOTS of files
2010-12-01T12:51:37  <antimatroid> simultaneous game* stuff
2010-12-01T12:51:46  <Meatkat> How were you abstracting to the point where a tree was possible?
2010-12-01T12:52:51  <antimatroid> in my tree, a single move was a vector of fleets all with the same destination, but multiple sources and send times
2010-12-01T12:53:07  <antimatroid> in my zero sum game, a pure strategy was a vector of such jointly feasible moves
2010-12-01T12:53:31  <antimatroid> i was using decision trees to generate pure strategies for the zero sum game
2010-12-01T12:53:36  <Error323> so you attacked/defended one planet per turn
2010-12-01T12:53:50  <antimatroid> Error323: no, i would pick my strings of moves out
2010-12-01T12:53:58  <antimatroid> but there was very few moves per turn yes

2010-12-01T12:54:16  <antimatroid> the zero sum game was meant to try and fix that by sampling the best nodes from the decision trees
2010-12-01T12:54:25  <antimatroid> then making the payoff matrix from that, but it just wasn't working
2010-12-01T12:55:29  <antimatroid> at the start of each turn i would run a round of defensive moves over planets and at the end redistribute, but other than that my bot makes like 1-2 rounds of moves to a planet each turn
2010-12-01T12:55:42  * Error323 kinda curious what would happen if he were to implement a proper eval function and better actions using alphabeta

2010-12-01T12:56:19  <mega1> 4 plies in the opening phase
2010-12-01T12:56:42  <antimatroid> mega1: is that sort of how you did your zero sum game?
2010-12-01T12:57:09  <mega1> antimatroid: sorry, I don't understand the question.
2010-12-01T12:57:26  <antimatroid> you tried implementing a simultaneous game in a payoff matrix at some point yeah?

2010-12-01T12:59:44  <antimatroid> as i've said many times, i don't like it when extending my tree, and evaluating it was almost free
2010-12-01T12:59:56  <mega1> antimatroid: a move in my nash setup was a real move: a set of orders without restriction on target planets
2010-12-01T13:00:17  <antimatroid> what do you mean restriction on target planet?
2010-12-01T13:00:32  <antimatroid> you "sent" fleets without sending them anywhere?
2010-12-01T13:00:40  <Error323> like with the chance of losing it?
2010-12-01T13:00:52  <mega1> antimatroid: you said that a move in your approach was to a single planet
2010-12-01T13:01:02  <antimatroid> ah yeah okay
2010-12-01T13:01:03  <Error323> you mean you computed every possible move @ start mega?
2010-12-01T13:01:09  <mega1> such moves corresponded to rows and column of the payoff matrix, right?
2010-12-01T13:01:15  <antimatroid> i had a vector of those moves for a pure strategy in my zero sum game
2010-12-01T13:01:20  <antimatroid> yep
2010-12-01T13:01:44  <mega1> okay, I took the N most promising moves for each player and those were my rows/columns
2010-12-01T13:01:58  <Error323> i see
2010-12-01T13:02:00  <antimatroid> basically i made 2 decision tree's for each player, so they could string moves together, then picked out the moves to get to each terminal node (or best x terminal nodes) and those formed my pure strategies for each player
2010-12-01T13:02:02  <mega1> where most promising is a 1 ply search with my normal eval function
2010-12-01T13:02:38  <antimatroid> i think that's the same?
2010-12-01T13:02:41  <antimatroid> pretty much?
2010-12-01T13:02:58  <bhasker> is the ranking page not being updated anymore?
2010-12-01T13:03:03  <antimatroid> is your 1 ply just a decision tree?

2010-12-01T13:04:06  <mega1> antimatroid: I'm not sure I follow.
2010-12-01T13:04:50  <Frontier> mega1: Did you do any special treatment of the first turn to find the best order in which to take neutral planets to maximise ships at a specific future turn?
2010-12-01T13:05:12  <mega1> Frontier: not really
2010-12-01T13:05:17  <antimatroid> what do you do with a 1 ply search? my decision tree goes like layer one {no moves, move to best planet 1, ...}, then i make a tree with just my moves like that
2010-12-01T13:05:36  <mega1> Frontier: the opening phase is special in the sense that it's using 4 ply alpha beta
2010-12-01T13:05:44  <mega1> that includes the first turn.
2010-12-01T13:05:55  <Error323> mine did that too
2010-12-01T13:06:02  <Error323> it had quite a dramatic improvement
2010-12-01T13:06:03  <antimatroid> yeah, selection of planets on the first turn is much more important than maximising return
2010-12-01T13:06:50  <mega1> antimatroid: and what do you get out of that tree?
2010-12-01T13:07:52  <antimatroid> moves that i plan to make, or for the zero sum game, my pure strategies
2010-12-01T13:08:01  <antimatroid> zero sum == simultaneous**

2010-12-01T13:09:05  <mega1> does that tree contain orders for the future?
2010-12-01T13:09:39  <antimatroid> i don't increment any states at any point, my fleets can contain moves sent from a planet that i don't even own yet
2010-12-01T13:09:55  <antimatroid> so yeah
2010-12-01T13:09:57  <mega1> ok, I understand
2010-12-01T13:10:25  <antimatroid> the biggest problem with doing the game tree like that was it'd pick out moves for them, respond to them and then send those orders
2010-12-01T13:10:28  <Error323> that's putting a lot of faith in ur tree =)
2010-12-01T13:10:32  <mega1> I have a function called generate-moves-from-steps that does kind of what your decision tree does.
2010-12-01T13:10:37  <antimatroid> but i managed to eliminate that by sending fleets only when they were needed
2010-12-01T13:10:53  <antimatroid> Error323: my whole bot is my tree :P
2010-12-01T13:11:10  <antimatroid> managed to mostly* eliminate that
2010-12-01T13:11:11  <mega1> it orders steps by scores and tries to form composite moves
2010-12-01T13:11:30  <antimatroid> yep, that was the idea
2010-12-01T13:11:34  <Error323> mega1: by composite you mean synchronized?
2010-12-01T13:11:45  <antimatroid> no
2010-12-01T13:12:00  <antimatroid> it means take planet a, then consider the reward from that when taking b
2010-12-01T13:12:12  <antimatroid> at least that's my understanding
2010-12-01T13:12:29  <mega1> Error323: no, each step is a synchronized attack to a single planet
2010-12-01T13:12:42  <mega1> a move is just a set of steps.
2010-12-01T13:12:43  <Error323> ah ok
2010-12-01T13:13:17  <mega1> so I order steps by evaluating them with the usual eval function

2010-12-01T13:36:54  <medrimonia> You can't sell cocaine but there's even place of drugs consumption
2010-12-01T13:37:06  <BaronTrozo> here no drugs except tobaco an alcohol is tolerated
2010-12-01T13:37:15  <medrimonia> It's forbidden to buy or sell drugs
2010-12-01T13:37:24  <BaronTrozo> is chis contest a drug????? ;)
2010-12-01T13:37:30  <BaronTrozo> chis -> this
2010-12-01T13:37:35  <medrimonia> But there's very few drugs really prohibited
2010-12-01T13:37:40  <antimatroid> lsd is better than a lot of other drugs
2010-12-01T13:37:50  <antimatroid> you can't easily overdose etc.
2010-12-01T13:37:56  <BaronTrozo> i don't know, i dont use them
2010-12-01T13:38:06  <BaronTrozo> perhaps one beer
2010-12-01T13:38:15  <Error323> antimatroid: its not, lsd can be very dangerous also
2010-12-01T13:38:31  <Error323> it can activate a psychosis if you are sensitive to that
2010-12-01T13:38:37  <Error323> aswell as mushrooms

2010-12-01T13:47:41  <Mistmanov> :p
2010-12-01T13:47:45  <Error323> :P
2010-12-01T13:48:22  <Mistmanov> it's a bit dissapointing that we won't be getting random games within top100
2010-12-01T13:48:24  <Mistmanov> but oh well
2010-12-01T13:48:29  <Mistmanov> can't have everything =)
2010-12-01T13:48:43  <antimatroid> i've had a pretty good go at most bots in the top 100 i think
2010-12-01T13:48:44  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3802), _iouri_(3585), Slin-.-(3538), jimrogerz(3529), _Astek_(3521), Accoun(3513), george(3508), GreenTea(3508), asavis(3505), protocolocon(3496)
2010-12-01T13:48:45  <Error323> not disappointing to me :P
2010-12-01T13:48:53  <antimatroid> i've certainly had quite a few games with top 10 bots
2010-12-01T13:49:02  <antimatroid> and won a surprising number of them
2010-12-01T13:52:32  <bhasker> i just wish they would update ranking
2010-12-01T13:52:36  <bhasker> this mystery is killing me now
2010-12-01T13:52:44  <bhasker> it was reassuring to see it hold 50
2010-12-01T13:52:45  <bhasker> :(
2010-12-01T13:52:52  <Error323> 5 more hours :P
2010-12-01T13:53:02  <Mistmanov> I wish they would start a completely awesome competition in january or something
2010-12-01T13:53:09  <Mistmanov> januari?
2010-12-01T13:53:10  <Error323> +1
2010-12-01T13:53:17  <Error323> January
2010-12-01T13:53:25  <Error323> I think :P
2010-12-01T13:54:00  <Mistmanov> tbh, most of the ideas discussed didn't seem really interesting to me
2010-12-01T13:54:14  <Mistmanov> (I might not have read all the discussion, but eh..)
2010-12-01T13:54:19  <Error323> so what do you find interesting?
2010-12-01T13:54:21  <Mistmanov> racing, rts, weird chess lke games..
2010-12-01T13:54:28  <Mistmanov> those are all bad :p
2010-12-01T13:54:31  <Error323> lol
2010-12-01T13:54:35  <Error323> rts ain't bad :P
2010-12-01T13:54:59  <Mistmanov> maybe it's because I've played rts too seriously back in the day
2010-12-01T13:55:14  <Mistmanov> it kinda burned me out, all the stress of managing all the stuff at the same time..
2010-12-01T13:55:16  <Error323> so what would you like?
2010-12-01T13:55:21  <Mistmanov> and sure, a computer would be doing it now, but still :p
2010-12-01T13:55:27  <Mistmanov> yeah I dunno ^^
2010-12-01T13:55:33  <antimatroid> i like simple 2 player simultaneous games
2010-12-01T13:55:41  <antimatroid> but minimax gets kinda old

2010-12-01T13:55:43  <bhasker> rts is fun
2010-12-01T13:55:52  <bhasker> but it would be complicated for most people
2010-12-01T13:55:54  <rebelxt> bhasker: yeah you were still holding on to top50! we kinda swapped places yesterday ;-)
2010-12-01T13:55:55  <bhasker> i think the reason this was fun
2010-12-01T13:55:59  <smloh1> are the rankings frozen for suspense?
2010-12-01T13:56:04  <Error323> smloh1: indeed
2010-12-01T13:56:11  <bhasker> was it was simple to get a bot up and running
2010-12-01T13:56:20  <bhasker> an RTS bot will require a lot of boiler plate code
2010-12-01T13:56:29  <Error323> true
2010-12-01T13:56:30  <bhasker> so the starter packages will have to be a lot more comprehensive
2010-12-01T13:56:35  <smloh1> ah...
2010-12-01T13:56:50  <bhasker> i think the game should be a simple one to get into
2010-12-01T13:57:05  <bhasker> otherwise we won't see many takers
2010-12-01T13:57:07  <Error323> nah, imo we should evolve =)
2010-12-01T13:57:19  <Error323> you can make a simple interface for a complex game
2010-12-01T13:57:33  <bhasker> yea so the interface will be critical to get right
2010-12-01T13:58:14  <Mistmanov> I personally liked that you could just approach this game like "ok.. so what would be a good move to make?"
2010-12-01T13:58:25  <Mistmanov> like... you could fully understand what a bot is doing
2010-12-01T13:58:38  <Mistmanov> many of the more advanced AI tactics don't have that property I think
2010-12-01T13:58:47  <Mistmanov> or at least, your average Joe won't be able to think of it

2010-12-01T13:59:24  <Mistmanov> true. But I really liked the "ok, so I want my bot to only attack when I know for sure that it can take it", and then just doing simple calculations to get the numbers
2010-12-01T13:59:25  *** krypton is now known as _krypt0n_
2010-12-01T13:59:27  <Error323> but I do agree this game was very well chosen
2010-12-01T14:00:31  <Error323> as was tron
2010-12-01T14:00:40  <Error323> too bad i didn't know of it back then =)
2010-12-01T14:01:32  <Error323> but an rts can be made easy or complex very simple
2010-12-01T14:01:43  <Error323> ehhhh very gradually i mean
2010-12-01T14:03:14  <smloh1> janzert: you could reactivate the countdown to countdown to when the final results will be released

2010-12-01T14:05:11  <janzert> well, the release of results depends a bit on how quickly Jeff makes it home from work and can get everything together to make the release so may not be quite as firm and I'd rather not countdown to "dead air" :/
2010-12-01T14:06:23  <janzert> I am pretty hopeful that it will happen pretty close to the scheduled time though
2010-12-01T14:06:43  <bhasker> dammit janzert this mystery is killing me :p we all know rank 1 anyway

2010-12-01T14:07:07  <iouri> an extremely dumbed down RTS could work.  Maybe with only one resource, one unit type and one building type

2010-12-01T14:10:10  <antimatroid> 3d tron ftw
2010-12-01T14:10:17  <bhasker> supcom was awesome, i wish they hadn't dumbed it down in supcom2

2010-12-01T14:10:28  <janzert> bhasker: there isn't one, smloh1 was asking my to turn the one used to countdown to the start of the finals back on
2010-12-01T14:10:40  <bhasker> ah
2010-12-01T14:10:58  <Error323> bhasker: you should really try TASpring
2010-12-01T14:11:04  <bhasker> i tried it long back
2010-12-01T14:11:08  <bhasker> but supcom > TASpring
2010-12-01T14:11:12  <Error323> its improved quite a lot
2010-12-01T14:11:15  <Error323> no! =)
2010-12-01T14:11:16  <bhasker> i have supcom and the supcom expansion
2010-12-01T14:11:20  <bhasker> and supcom2
2010-12-01T14:12:01  <bhasker> does it have a good multiplayer group?
2010-12-01T14:12:08  <bhasker> cause i don't like playing against AI
2010-12-01T14:12:13  <Error323> yes
2010-12-01T14:12:14  <bhasker> i find it very boring
2010-12-01T14:12:17  <bhasker> to beat RTS AI
2010-12-01T14:12:22  <Error323> try mine :P
2010-12-01T14:12:24  <bhasker> very few are challenging enough
2010-12-01T14:12:27  <Error323> its very agressive
2010-12-01T14:12:34  <bhasker> i liked sorian's AI in Supcom
2010-12-01T14:12:34  <Error323> it does cheat though
2010-12-01T14:12:41  <bhasker> yea cheating AI's are lame
2010-12-01T14:12:52  <bhasker> sorian's AI in supcom would do interesting stuff
2010-12-01T14:12:56  <bhasker> like transport drops and stuff
2010-12-01T14:13:03  <bhasker> even the supcom2 AI is quite interesting
2010-12-01T14:13:06  <bhasker> does really annoying stuff
2010-12-01T14:13:12  <bhasker> like sending engineers behind lines
2010-12-01T14:13:15  <bhasker> to capture resource spots
2010-12-01T14:13:19  <bhasker> mass spots etc
2010-12-01T14:13:21  <antimatroid> what would be interesting is a game where you played, but you could write your own code to give you certain information
2010-12-01T14:13:22  <bhasker> very very annoying
2010-12-01T14:13:31  <antimatroid> or you could tell it to pick moves from a particular type of tree etc.
2010-12-01T14:13:44  <bhasker> so which spring RTS should i install?
2010-12-01T14:14:02  <Error323> http://springrts.com/wiki/Download
2010-12-01T14:14:38  <antimatroid> i like the idea of a game where players have weapons, but players make their own weapons based on certain guidelines
2010-12-01T14:14:42  <Error323> haven't played it for quite a while though
2010-12-01T14:14:57  <antimatroid> and weapons get sent off like bots, with pre programmed characteristics
2010-12-01T14:15:05  <antimatroid> and run their own instances
2010-12-01T14:15:21  <bhasker> evolution RTS looks quite nice

2010-12-01T14:48:35  <janzert> I probably won't be around much at all for the next contest, either as a participant or organizer

2010-12-01T14:48:46  <Error323> i see
2010-12-01T14:50:08  <Meatkat> A tower defense game would be be pretty cool, especially if you were able to influence the creeps for the enemy tower maze
2010-12-01T14:51:23  <Error323> it would also be pretty simple

2010-12-01T15:15:22  <JamesMG> a tower defense game would be fun to do, if it was complicated enough
2010-12-01T15:16:53  <Meatkat> If you had a consistantly changing environment it would help, that would stop people from using set maze techniques
2010-12-01T15:17:11  <Meatkat> So each map has a slightly different space for you to build your maze

2010-12-01T15:18:12  <Meatkat> Then to make it more head-to-head instead of just a one player thing you could have the option to spend money to increase the power/number of the enemies 'creeps' (creatures going through the maze)
2010-12-01T15:18:41  <JamesMG> we should write the game :)
2010-12-01T15:18:46  <Meatkat> enemys'
2010-12-01T15:18:50  <Meatkat> I'
2010-12-01T15:19:02  <Meatkat> I'd be down, though maybe a specification first
2010-12-01T15:19:41  <JamesMG> I'd play it human vs human actually, sounds fun
2010-12-01T15:20:14  <Meatkat> Yeah, used to play a lot of tower defense custom mods in WC3, there were several like that
2010-12-01T15:20:21  <Meatkat> hella fun, but a bit hard to balance
2010-12-01T15:20:39  <Meatkat> Speaking of which... how would we balance it enough to be worthy of selection for this competition?
2010-12-01T15:20:55  <JamesMG> symmetry for starters
2010-12-01T15:21:09  <JamesMG> as far as making every game not a landslide victory, I have no idea
2010-12-01T15:21:11  <Meatkat> On the map terran, definately
2010-12-01T15:21:14  <Meatkat> definitely*
2010-12-01T15:22:11  <Meatkat> We could use some basic heuristics to give a cost comparison to make things about equal
2010-12-01T15:22:38  <JamesMG> it's hard for me to predict how balanced things would be without seeing it, sadly
2010-12-01T15:22:46  *** protocolocon <protocolocon!~lobo@117.187.218.87.dynamic.jazztel.es> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-01T15:22:53  <Meatkat> also adding compounding interest to unspent income adds another element, though we might be getting too complex
2010-12-01T15:23:45  <JamesMG> it seems that without some way to target the other player's weak spot(weakly defended planets in this case)
2010-12-01T15:23:54  <JamesMG> once a bot was winning it wouldn't lose
2010-12-01T15:24:42  <Meatkat> Different creep types - ie flying, immune to slowing effects, reduced dmg vs certain dmg types
2010-12-01T15:25:15  <JamesMG> oh, good idea
2010-12-01T15:25:18  <Meatkat> Say we use three types of towers, with a slowing tower and a magic tower that does low dmg but always does that damage
2010-12-01T15:25:26  <Meatkat> so five types total
2010-12-01T15:25:35  <Meatkat> or maybe you can simplify that down
2010-12-01T15:25:44  <Meatkat> but in any case that would add an element of weakness
2010-12-01T15:25:59  <Meatkat> you have to analyse your enemies maze and see what creep you want to buff for the next wave
2010-12-01T15:26:17  <JamesMG> would you allow maze mods during a wave?
2010-12-01T15:26:26  <lavalamp> ...every creep you kill gets added to the queue for your opponent
2010-12-01T15:26:31  *** rebelxt <rebelxt!~apinkin@24-155-144-5.static.grandenetworks.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-12-01T15:26:33  <JamesMG> or just have a setup phase between waves?
2010-12-01T15:27:10  <Meatkat> building during allows for cycles to be created... ie the creeps get trapped in the maze going back and forth as the player sells and builds
2010-12-01T15:27:48  <Meatkat> so probably in between? but the entire cost of the tower would need to be represented in the cost - usually it's cost + build time
2010-12-01T15:28:00  <Meatkat> which would simplify things
2010-12-01T15:28:21  <JamesMG> and then we don't have to deal with timing over stdout
2010-12-01T15:28:35  <Meatkat> yup
2010-12-01T15:28:55  <Meatkat> and we can give them a certain amount of time to set build orders and enemy creep buff/command orders
2010-12-01T15:29:13  <Meatkat> then it's deterministic from there
2010-12-01T15:29:31  <Meatkat> unless we do random tower damage, which we should maybe avoid?
2010-12-01T15:29:33  <JamesMG> just have to set the limit low enough to prevent exhaustive tree searches
2010-12-01T15:29:44  <JamesMG> yeah, I'd say stay away from randomness
2010-12-01T15:30:05  <Meatkat> makes for unhappy programmers... why did my tower only do 1 dmg 10 times in a row!
2010-12-01T15:30:20  <JamesMG> plus then Accoun will call everyone chiters some more :)
2010-12-01T15:30:31  <Meatkat> ROFL
2010-12-01T15:30:55  <Meatkat> 3. Canadian reasons
2010-12-01T15:30:56  <Meatkat> ...
2010-12-01T15:31:14  <Meatkat> or was it special, Canadian only reason? idk
2010-12-01T15:31:21  <Meatkat> either way that one made me crack up
2010-12-01T15:31:26  <JamesMG> haha, yeah
2010-12-01T15:31:51  <JamesMG> was the planetwars spec/gameplay engine open source before the contest?
2010-12-01T15:32:09  <Meatkat> Planetwars is based on Galcon which is not open source
2010-12-01T15:32:21  <Meatkat> I think they had to ask the creator if they could mod the idea for the contest
2010-12-01T15:32:29  <JamesMG> ah
2010-12-01T15:32:50  <JamesMG> I played Galcon on Steam months before this contest
2010-12-01T15:33:04  <JamesMG> it feels so slow after watching bots play hundreds of games :)
2010-12-01T15:33:42  <Meatkat> One other question though.... how about target selection/prioritization? Or I guess that could be part of the AI, individual tower programming algorithms
2010-12-01T15:33:51  <Meatkat> but then you run into problems during gametime
2010-12-01T15:34:00  <Meatkat> the waves are no longer deterministic
2010-12-01T15:34:07  <JamesMG> right
2010-12-01T15:34:10  <Meatkat> but tower target selection is pretty important
2010-12-01T15:34:39  <JamesMG> being able to target with the towers efficiently would make a huge difference...
2010-12-01T15:35:32  <Meatkat> and then you're back to user input for every step in the wave, which could work, but makes games MUCH longer
2010-12-01T15:35:50  <JamesMG> maybe ditch the "wave" idea and go with a constant stream of creeps
2010-12-01T15:35:55  <Meatkat> (read: more computationally expensive)
2010-12-01T15:35:56  <JamesMG> and a timed step/turn
2010-12-01T15:36:02  <Error323> :]
2010-12-01T15:36:17  <JamesMG> but then yeah, games take a very long time to run
2010-12-01T15:36:32  <Mistmanov> yay, beat #13
2010-12-01T15:36:51  <Mistmanov> when was the contest going to end again?
2010-12-01T15:37:05  <Mistmanov> middle of the night for me probably (it's 21.30 here)
2010-12-01T15:37:24  <Error323> 1am
2010-12-01T15:37:30  <Mistmanov> damn
2010-12-01T15:37:30  <JamesMG> I think it ends in 4 hours or so?
2010-12-01T15:37:43  <Mistmanov> that's too early.. might be tempted to stay up :p
2010-12-01T15:37:50  <Meatkat> Haha
2010-12-01T15:37:55  <Error323> me 2 =)
2010-12-01T15:38:53  <Meatkat> Is the targetting problem a tower-defense killer? or is there a way around it?
2010-12-01T15:38:53  <meneky> anyone would like an sport based game, as a simplified soccer or basket
2010-12-01T15:38:58  <meneky> ?
2010-12-01T15:39:35  <Mistmanov> hm
2010-12-01T15:39:39  <Mistmanov> that could probably be interesting
2010-12-01T15:39:45  <JamesMG> if we didn't have to support so many languages I'd say let the bot provide a targetting algo that gets run in realtime
2010-12-01T15:39:55  <Error323> that is very(!) complez
2010-12-01T15:40:00  <Error323> multiagent
2010-12-01T15:40:15  <JamesMG> for each tower type
2010-12-01T15:40:57  <Meatkat> JamesMG: Yeah... giving them a rather simple targetting priority rules and just saying tough for the rest
2010-12-01T15:41:14  <Mistmanov> if you had a sports game that just included players of a certain radius, a ball, 2 goals, and passing the ball to a certain location, it would be pretty cool
2010-12-01T15:41:17  <JamesMG> or provide a handful of priorities to choose from
2010-12-01T15:41:33  <JamesMG> closest creep to end zone, weakest creep, etc
2010-12-01T15:41:43  <protocolocon> anyone knows liquidwar?
2010-12-01T15:41:52  <Meatkat> YES!
2010-12-01T15:41:55  <protocolocon> it's a very challenging real time geometric game
2010-12-01T15:42:14  <protocolocon> could be interesting for an ai engine
2010-12-01T15:42:27  <Meatkat> I forget how to take over other peoples liquid though, do you surround it? or is it something different

2010-12-01T15:42:48  <Meatkat> JamesMG: Yeah... defining those could get a bit tricky, but it would be doable
2010-12-01T15:43:27  <JamesMG> this tower idea is already multiples more complex than planetwars I think
2010-12-01T15:43:36  <protocolocon> nop, there is something like a frontier pressure, the more pressure, the more one liquid "gets into the other"
2010-12-01T15:44:48  <protocolocon> it's available under most linux distros
2010-12-01T15:44:48  <Meatkat> JamesMG: That's true. Maybe bring it down to two tower types, black and white, keep the interest, and use money to buff/change the black/white balance of the opponents creeps?
2010-12-01T15:45:12  <protocolocon> apt-get install liquidwar
2010-12-01T15:45:36  <Meatkat> JamesMG: Maybe they don't have to be towers at all! Maybe you're just assigning black/white damage to certain squares... and when a creep walks on those squares it takes damage
2010-12-01T15:45:55  <Meatkat> JamesMG: then you'd have to be able to build mazing walls to force the creeps in
2010-12-01T15:46:08  <JamesMG> I like that square defense idea

2010-12-01T15:46:31  <Meatkat> protocolocon: Yeah... coming back to me now, apt-getting it now, it's a fun game... how are you going to issue commands though
2010-12-01T15:47:22  <protocolocon> you only have to move a pointer (center of gravity of your liquid)
2010-12-01T15:47:28  <protocolocon> around the map

2010-12-01T15:47:46  <Meatkat> JamesMG: There has to be a way to force the creeps to walk over a square though, their movement should be governed by a very simple set of rules
2010-12-01T15:47:57  <protocolocon> very cpu intensive
2010-12-01T15:48:15  <Meatkat> protocolocon: do you think it could easily scale down?
2010-12-01T15:48:40  <protocolocon> Meatkat, i used to play against my old job teamates, and it's really challenging

2010-12-01T15:48:56  <protocolocon> Meatkat, maybe water possitions could be discretized
2010-12-01T15:49:24  <protocolocon> i think there was a win2 port
2010-12-01T15:49:24  <Error323> looks cool
2010-12-01T15:50:11  <Meatkat> protocolocon: I would agree that it's very challenging, and yeah, if you cut the playing field into discrete units, that would help a lot of the calculations...

2010-12-01T15:52:12  <Meatkat> JamesMG: or maybe you have an nxn tile board, and some of the tiles are black, some are white. Every iteration you can change the color of a certain amount of tiles. At the same time your enemy gets to choose the pathway for the single creep to use your maze after you've finished. the creep can either be black or white and takes dmg if it steps on an opposite square

2010-12-01T15:52:52  <Meatkat> JamesMG: or maybe you are using the same board, one is black one is white, and you both get to choose an equal number of tiles to change color then find a route accross?
2010-12-01T15:52:56  <Meatkat> That is really simple
2010-12-01T15:53:11  <JamesMG> so a combination of walking a maze and building one
2010-12-01T15:53:42  <JamesMG> it allows for some pretty neat AI I think
2010-12-01T15:54:07  <lavalamp> that does sound pretty interesting
2010-12-01T15:54:49  <lavalamp> I guess your score is the number of your creeps that get all the way to the other side?
2010-12-01T15:55:18  <Error323> its like dynamic go =)
2010-12-01T15:55:19  <Meatkat> Or if you are only sending one, the number of enemy tiles you need to step on to get there
2010-12-01T15:55:53  <Meatkat> You could make it more interesting by allowing tile changes while the creep is on the tiles
2010-12-01T15:56:10  <JamesMG> just add a tile to your "resources" every so often?
2010-12-01T15:56:15  <Meatkat> so you and your enemy have a creep that needs to get the opposite side that you can control and there are two stages: change and move

2010-12-01T15:56:36  <Meatkat> yeah, you can change a tile every certain number of moves
2010-12-01T15:56:55  <Meatkat> maybe you can say that your creep can't even walk on the enemy tiles
2010-12-01T15:57:13  <JamesMG> and make the score the number of moves it takes to reach the end?
2010-12-01T15:57:19  <Meatkat> and instead of adding a tile in wherever, you push the whole row/column down or up, and add another tile
2010-12-01T15:57:19  <JamesMG> higher being worse
2010-12-01T15:57:26  <Meatkat> yup

2010-12-01T16:01:02  <Meatkat> I think that could be interesting... you start on an n by n randomized symmetric board with black starting in one corner and white in the other. white then gets to move a column up or down or a row left or right and add a white tile in the newely created space. Then both players move (legal moves are up/down/left/right and only to a square of your color). Then black gets to manipulate the maze and they both move again. Repeat
2010-12-01T16:02:51  <Meatkat> It's like opposite maze vs The Cube
2010-12-01T16:02:58  <Meatkat> or meets rather
2010-12-01T16:05:04  <Meatkat> Whoever gets to the opposite corner first wins
2010-12-01T16:05:25  <Meatkat> or whoever is Euclidian closest after 200 turns
2010-12-01T16:05:35  <Meatkat> or so
2010-12-01T16:06:06  <JamesMG> I think that would be fun

2010-12-01T16:37:56  <iouri> ahh, gotcha
2010-12-01T16:38:48  <JamesMG> I don't think it'd have the same awesome fireworks planetwars does though
2010-12-01T16:39:26  <Meatkat> I think if you were looking at a replay it would be pretty interesting to watch, but yeah, not even close the level of epic star battles
2010-12-01T16:39:52  <Meatkat> Though I think it's a more exciting twist on maze games in general
2010-12-01T16:40:11  <Meatkat> Maybe we could add some element of explosions or guns or something
2010-12-01T16:40:20  <Epona> tower defense is aweful
2010-12-01T16:40:38  <Mistmanov> well, that's a clear opinion :p
2010-12-01T16:40:39  <Meatkat> It's no longer recognizable as tower defense
2010-12-01T16:41:09  <Meatkat> Has anyone seen the movie "The Cube?"
2010-12-01T16:41:17  <Epona> I played bloons, realized theres only one or 2 ways to beat it on the hardest difficulty, and never looked back
2010-12-01T16:41:17  <JamesMG> it's more like a maze version of go or Othello
2010-12-01T16:41:20  <Meatkat> it's like that... sort of... but without the danger
2010-12-01T16:42:19  <Meatkat> however danger in the form of monsters/explosions/traps/etc... could be added in

2010-12-01T16:57:20  <Mistmanov> it should be pretty easy, depending on the exact rules
2010-12-01T16:57:33  <Error323> all of these field could occupie you for a lifetime :P
2010-12-01T16:58:23  <Mistmanov> true, but for the AI contest.. just need a program hat can move in a straight line towards a ball, and pass it
2010-12-01T16:58:23  <Error323> these are teamefforts
2010-12-01T16:59:26  <Mistmanov> the actual dogs are way more complicated because they need to... actually kick the ball and stuff
2010-12-01T17:00:04  <Mistmanov> but if you just had a function of kickBall(power, direction)..
2010-12-01T17:00:05  <meneky> and with 3 or 4 agents per team (not 11 as real soccer)?
2010-12-01T17:00:11  <meneky> and simplified rules
2010-12-01T17:00:36  <Epona> anyone have code out that has a neural net or mutational algorithms?

2010-12-01T17:05:36  <Error323> lmao
2010-12-01T17:06:36  <Mistmanov> but yeah, we were used to the ranking significantly changing with every few games.
2010-12-01T17:07:01  <Mistmanov> so it feels kinda weird now that a lot of games can have almost no impact
2010-12-01T17:08:01  <Error323> however, at the moment of the "freeze"
2010-12-01T17:08:07  <Error323> we had an elo difference of 3
2010-12-01T17:08:22  <Error323> so it kinda makes me scary
2010-12-01T17:08:46  <Mistmanov> yeah it's basically luck now
2010-12-01T17:08:46  <lavalamp> when did the freeze happen?

2010-12-01T17:09:01  <mega1> Mistmanov: did you explain somewhere how your bot works?
2010-12-01T17:09:21  <Mistmanov> the final bot doesn't have a lot of description, no
2010-12-01T17:09:37  <Mistmanov> but there isn't really a big overarching strategy
2010-12-01T17:10:48  <mega1> how come it performs remarkably constantly against oppositions of different levels?
2010-12-01T17:11:13  <Mistmanov> I think it's because it's very weak at expanding
2010-12-01T17:11:19  <Error323> I think because its good at certain map
2010-12-01T17:11:21  <Error323> maps
2010-12-01T17:11:27  <Mistmanov> but pretty good at conquering
2010-12-01T17:11:46  <Mistmanov> so if a map requires good expansion, I'm going to lose
2010-12-01T17:12:05  <Mistmanov> if a map requires direct fighting with the enemy, I can win against a wide range of opponents
2010-12-01T17:12:29  <Mistmanov> at least, that's my theory
2010-12-01T17:12:44  <Error323> mega1: will you also enter the next contest?

2010-12-01T17:29:42  <burny> playing the lottery = voluntarily paying extra taxes
2010-12-01T17:30:04  <Mistmanov> unless you're lucky ;)
2010-12-01T17:30:19  <burny> luck has nothing to do with it..
2010-12-01T17:30:31  <burny> you coulda just got together with a bunch of random people, and played craps
2010-12-01T17:30:36  <Mistmanov> I approach it a bit like going to the casino.. you should only do it if the fun you get from it is worth the money you enter

2010-12-01T17:35:00  <bhasker> your blog is also on git?
2010-12-01T17:35:01  <davidjliu> suddenly he goes on a thirty game losing streak
2010-12-01T17:35:02  <bhasker> ...
2010-12-01T17:35:05  <davidjliu> and probably still ends up 1st
2010-12-01T17:35:07  <burny> is the pairing cutoff going to change any further?
2010-12-01T17:35:11  <mega1> Error323, Meatkat, bhasker: yes

2010-12-01T17:37:27  <bhasker> interesting
2010-12-01T17:37:43  <bhasker> i tried understanding git but too complicated till i try it out a bit
2010-12-01T17:37:49  <bhasker> will try it for my next project
2010-12-01T17:37:55  <burny> er, um..
2010-12-01T17:38:00  <mega1> it is too complicated indeed
2010-12-01T17:38:03  <burny> the 'games played' is going down instead of up?
2010-12-01T17:38:07  <burny> http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-12-01T17:38:16  <Error323> its 24 hours
2010-12-01T17:38:28  <Error323> first 1000 use heavy computation
2010-12-01T17:38:38  <Error323> so less games overall
2010-12-01T17:38:42  <Error323> but more among the 1000
2010-12-01T17:38:45  <rebelxt> games are being unplayed ;-)
2010-12-01T17:39:01  <burny> oh.. ya, didn't notice the 24hours there
2010-12-01T17:39:35  <rebelxt> 82 minutes left, correct?
2010-12-01T17:39:52  <Error323> yes

2010-12-01T17:40:27  <burny> 82mins till what?
2010-12-01T17:40:27  <Error323> hmmm mega1, Mistmanov its 22 wins for mistmanov and 6 draws

2010-12-01T17:40:52  <bhasker> oh phew my bot ifnally won a game
2010-12-01T17:40:56  <Error323> out of 150
2010-12-01T17:41:07  <mega1> that's not quite the 49 I remembered

2010-12-01T17:42:46  <medrimonia> But the funniest is that my two losses are against people out of top 30

2010-12-01T18:49:26  <smloh1> like, we design bots for a game, but the algorithms can be directly used to, say, most-efficiently route traffic
2010-12-01T18:49:38  <rebelxt> like stock market trading?
2010-12-01T18:49:57  <smloh1> but we can't have a competition for that, too boring and non-violent, has to be disguised as a game

2010-12-01T18:52:33  <rebelxt> traffic routing is pretty well researched (VRP class of problems), but there are still tons of interesting problems

2010-12-01T18:53:57  <smloh1> yeah, if we could have an interesting productive problem for the next competition, then it'd be a double-win
2010-12-01T18:54:25  <rebelxt> smloh1: agreed. real world problem would be cool

2010-12-01T19:49:08  <burny> man.. in the top 50, the bots that I beat the most were both top10
2010-12-01T19:49:55  * eburnette thinks burny missed his calling as a PR spin expert
2010-12-01T19:50:30  <burny> just like bocs lost to someof the 200-400 rank bots..
2010-12-01T19:50:51  <burny> my bot did bad against the bots that're worse than top10..
2010-12-01T19:51:03  <burny> cearly I needed better competition to prevail :)
2010-12-01T19:51:36  <eburnette> Anybody know real affiliation of bocsimacko, iouri, Astek, Account, george, asavis, and bix0r4ever? Web site just says "other".
2010-12-01T19:52:08  <jmcarthur> rock!
2010-12-01T19:52:14  <jmcarthur> congrats everybody!

2010-12-01T19:53:37  <eburnette> cool, is this your first contest?
2010-12-01T19:53:48  <flag> Second
2010-12-01T19:53:58  <eburnette> Did tron before?
2010-12-01T19:54:10  <flag> Yup, got disqualified due to a timeout on that one
2010-12-01T19:54:13  <j3camero> Whoa 15 that's awesome.

2010-12-01T19:58:45  <eburnette> Anybody besides me get in trouble for spending *way* too much time on the contest?
2010-12-01T19:58:59  <pgpaskar_> I got in trouble with myself for not spending enough helping out
2010-12-01T19:59:03  <pgpaskar_> But that's a different story.
2010-12-01T19:59:04  <Zannick> probably anyone married
2010-12-01T19:59:12  <Zannick> i'm pretty sure there were a few

2010-12-01T20:03:19  <burny> when I was in school, they mostly only had math contests :\

2010-12-01T20:03:44  <Cyndre_> burny: top 100 in canada and top 25 in alberta during grade 9 math tests
2010-12-01T20:04:09  <Cyndre_> vn flag, ranked 95 myself (that is 1195)
2010-12-01T20:04:13  <burny> how many different ones did you do?
2010-12-01T20:04:23  <meneky> Cyndre_ : no, this is my first ai contest, and began too late :(
2010-12-01T20:04:27  <Cyndre_> burny: only the grade 9 one
2010-12-01T20:04:39  <burny> ah.. I did a whole bunch of them
2010-12-01T20:04:42  <Cyndre_> I started tron late, but started this one on time but drug away for last month of contest

2010-12-01T20:05:16  <Cyndre_> in todays day and age I would probably not even place top 500 though
2010-12-01T20:05:32  <eburnette> I found a picture of mega1 at http://media.linkedin.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/053/091/12b232f.jpg if anybody's interested
2010-12-01T20:06:10  <Cyndre_> Oct 3rd 18:57:01 was my last upload - good or bad that Im 1100 now?
2010-12-01T20:06:20  <Cyndre_> well 1200
2010-12-01T20:06:32  <eburnette> October, wow, I'd say 1100 was not too shabby
2010-12-01T20:07:18  <Cyndre_> ooo they added ships per turn to the graph
2010-12-01T20:08:41  <medrimonia> But flag, you've got programmation classes at school and you're 15?

2010-12-01T20:09:51  <flag> Introductory class in highschool, only teaches us visual basic and how to use dreamweaver

2010-12-01T20:11:26  <flag> I don't think they start to teach anything complex until university here anyway, but they give us a start I suppose
2010-12-01T20:11:40  <a1k0n_> i uploaded sep 8th, sep 11th, and nov 23rd
2010-12-01T20:11:42  <flag> I'd rather they had an electronics class tbh
2010-12-01T20:11:59  <a1k0n_> (i uploaded a bot i hadn't touched in months in the last week.  oh well)
2010-12-01T20:12:31  <burny> how'd it do a1k0n?
2010-12-01T20:12:38  <medrimonia> In fact, I haven't really learn anything complexe in my univeristy
2010-12-01T20:12:56  <a1k0n_> #441.  and i'm not doing anything very different from iouri.  it's amazing how the details matter.
2010-12-01T20:12:59  <burny> man.. I only worked on the thing for 4days :\
2010-12-01T20:13:13  <smloh1> eburnette: my wife is more subtle, she said "Let's celebrate!" but i'm pretty sure it means the same thing...

2010-12-01T20:13:47  <a1k0n_> i have a couple other versions of the bot which might have done better in the final contest but i'm not sure.  it's weird how A beats B beats C beats A
2010-12-01T20:14:06  <medrimonia> smloh1 and eburnette: My girlfriend is sleeping but I'm sure that she's happy that the contest has ended
2010-12-01T20:14:55  <Cyndre_> its over?
2010-12-01T20:14:57  <eburnette> alk0n_ try this for fun: click on any profile, look at their last lost game, click on the profile of who they lost to, and repeat.
2010-12-01T20:15:04  <smloh1> next contest?  heheh i'm not sure this is a good time to broach that topic
2010-12-01T20:15:11  <Cyndre_> my days are finally going back to 8 hours and I could have time to work on the contest now

2010-12-01T20:23:14  <j3camero> I wanted to do Go for this AI contest, but people shot it down hard.
2010-12-01T20:23:39  <burny> go is WAY too hard for something liek this(not to mention, it's already studied)
2010-12-01T20:24:00  <eburnette> j3camero because it's been done so much?
2010-12-01T20:24:21  <j3camero> I started coding the engine, but the biggest problem I encountered was the victory condition. There is actually no victory condition.
2010-12-01T20:24:24  <burny> if go was a brand new game.. it could be appropriate though

2010-12-01T20:24:44  <j3camero> In general, there is no way to end the game unless both players agree to end the game.

2010-12-01T20:25:05  <j3camero> And there is no good starter package strategy for that.
2010-12-01T20:25:16  <j3camero> eburnette: I invented it :-)
2010-12-01T20:25:58  <eburnette> Was tron the first one?

2010-12-01T20:28:08  <eburnette> Oh yeah I've been meaning to ask, how do you program an AI for RPS? Isn't it random?
2010-12-01T20:28:15  <j3camero> First step is to choose a game :-)
2010-12-01T20:28:43  <flag> Alright, I'll probably have some time during the winter break, I'll see what I can do
2010-12-01T20:28:47  <Cyndre_> statego
2010-12-01T20:29:03  <burny> did people seriously try rps?.. or was there some sort of twist to it?
2010-12-01T20:29:03  <Cyndre_> risk would be fun to
2010-12-01T20:29:34  <Cyndre_> er stratego not statego
2010-12-01T20:29:57  <meneky> sports game please, soccer or the like, or at least something funny to replay
2010-12-01T20:30:02  <eburnette> How about a tower defense game
2010-12-01T20:30:07  <j3camero> burny: RPS is harder than you think. It's not random. It's iterated RPS.
2010-12-01T20:30:24  <meneky> it must be funny to replay and addictive, its key to success
2010-12-01T20:30:39  <protocolocon> meneky, agreed
2010-12-01T20:30:47  <Cyndre_> why not a bot battle - with shooting the enemy into submission
2010-12-01T20:31:21  <burny> iterated?
2010-12-01T20:31:30  <Cyndre_> timed grenades that go off x turns after placing and you only start with 10
2010-12-01T20:31:32  <eburnette> Angry Birds? Or maybe a tank game like iShoot.
2010-12-01T20:32:01  <burny> ishoot looks like a total ripoff of scorced earth
2010-12-01T20:32:07  <meneky> i think another key to success is an small learning curve, newbies must be able to make a bot fast
2010-12-01T20:32:17  <eburnette> starter packs help there
2010-12-01T20:32:28  <Cyndre_> more like atari tank with mines or something
2010-12-01T20:32:58  <eburnette> Yeah, atari tanks rock, good idea
2010-12-01T20:33:10  <meneky> Cyndre_: very good idea
2010-12-01T20:33:11  <Cyndre_> 2 track speeds, 360 degree turret, fire gun, lay mine for x turns
2010-12-01T20:33:28  <burny> oh.. the atari tank game, with bouncy walls, and invisible tanks could be quite cool
2010-12-01T20:33:37  <Cyndre_> and fun to watch
2010-12-01T20:33:55  <burny> the only problem with tank.. would be processing time/game duration
2010-12-01T20:34:02  <eburnette> There's a nice Wii version of the tank game I like
2010-12-01T20:34:03  <Cyndre_> could have x health, y ammo, and z mines with random popups
2010-12-01T20:34:35  <eburnette> destroyable walls? different kinds of ammo?
2010-12-01T20:35:00  <Cyndre_> depends how far you want to go - I was thinking just simple gun and mines that you program to go off in x turns
2010-12-01T20:35:03  <burny> a game with a total time limit, in addition to a per-turn time limit, could be nice
2010-12-01T20:35:14  <Cyndre_> 60 second timelimit and you lose 1 health per turn
2010-12-01T20:35:19  <Cyndre_> start with 60 health
2010-12-01T20:36:26  <eburnette> real time play might be a problem
2010-12-01T20:36:32  <meneky> i think is better to keep the concept as simple as possible, as few rules as possible to make it complex enought to be a challenge
2010-12-01T20:37:03  <Cyndre_> well its not realtime play, they can move x distance for every 1 second turn (and maybe just tank with most health after 60 turns wins)
2010-12-01T20:37:06  * eburnette votes for predetermined maps
2010-12-01T20:37:43  <burny> premade maps, with random/unknown starting spot!
2010-12-01T20:38:14  <eburnette> Yeah, I think the maps should be hand drawn, not generated too.
2010-12-01T20:38:58  <Cyndre_> or capture the flag would be fun and simple
2010-12-01T20:39:16  <eburnette> I'd like non symmetric maps
2010-12-01T20:39:21  <burny> an AI challenge that would be kind of interesting(from teh AI perspective)..
2010-12-01T20:39:47  <eburnette> Hey maybe the US army could co-sponsor :)
2010-12-01T20:39:59  <Cyndre_> for the tank wars?
2010-12-01T20:40:19  <eburnette> yeah
2010-12-01T20:40:35  <burny> is limited to a total of 1meg of internet traffic, 1meg of code/data. and given a list of words, and 30seconds. pick a word from the list, plus any other one word, and get the most google hits possible
2010-12-01T20:40:42  <Cyndre_> eburnette: in all honesty whats the difference if its a sensor saying obstacle in front or a function check?>
2010-12-01T20:41:40  <eburnette> well hopefully you can look around more than just in front
2010-12-01T20:42:20  <eburnette> but fog of war would be interesting twist, limited knowledge of what's going on away from you (instead of perfect planetwars knowledge)
2010-12-01T20:42:26  <Cyndre_> yea, but meant if you check for stuff with a camera or by asking the server for the map - really its the same thing, your just making decisions with other peoples info
2010-12-01T20:43:00  <Cyndre_> some of the stuff they are doing with the kinect is awsome fyi
2010-12-01T20:43:27  <eburnette> sure, of course if you're driving a physical object you have innacuracies to deal with
2010-12-01T20:44:04  <eburnette> something with lego mindstorm perhaps?
2010-12-01T20:44:18  <Cyndre_> and who else watched the video jeff hawkins (I am pretty sure thats who) did on neural networks?
2010-12-01T20:45:03  <eburnette> In tank game would your own mines blow you up?
2010-12-01T20:45:27  <Cyndre_> yes, they could either blow up after x turns, or blow up when moved onto them (undetectable)

2010-12-01T20:50:53  <eburnette> Why do you want the minds to blow up on their own? strategy could involve building a mine fortress that stays around

2010-12-01T20:52:48  <eburnette> can you shoot mines?
2010-12-01T20:52:49  <Cyndre> sounds fair
2010-12-01T20:53:28  <eburnette> has anybody done an ai for Battleship?
2010-12-01T20:53:48  <burny> no, but it needs SOME sort of twist, to make it be interesting
2010-12-01T20:54:05  <burny> eg. opponent can move ships, or multiple shots at a time, etc.
2010-12-01T20:54:58  <Cyndre> battleship is fairly borring - hunt and peck for ship, find direction, then continue both ways till miss
2010-12-01T20:55:29  <burny> in RL battleship has interestign strategy elements
2010-12-01T20:55:38  <burny> eg. how far apart do you think they spaced the ships?
2010-12-01T20:56:01  <Cyndre> I mix it up - I would place my ships randomly I think
2010-12-01T20:56:19  <burny> if each turn though, you get a total of 5 moves(or one per ship.. or whatever)..
2010-12-01T20:56:23  <eburnette> how many contestants were there for planetwars and how did that compare with the previous contests?
2010-12-01T20:56:29  <burny> and a move can be: shoot at enemy field, or move a ship 1 space
2010-12-01T20:56:34  <burny> it could be rather interesting
2010-12-01T20:57:20  <eburnette> 4619?

2010-12-01T20:59:01  <burny> submiting the default ai.. or soemthing that crashes every time.. doesn't really count
2010-12-01T20:59:31  <Cyndre> how many people have more then 15 uploads?
2010-12-01T20:59:34  <burny> when you can turn the default bot, into a top500 bot in about 5minutes if you're good at math, and understand the game
2010-12-01T21:02:15  <j3camero> I was thinking of basically writing a really simple MMORTS. Basically a simple Starcraft with an infinite map and thousands of players. I would make it so you could start playing it through the browser. Then slap an API onto it so people can bot it.
2010-12-01T21:02:34  <burny> just take the default.. make it only attack when it can capture.. and make it send as many attacks as it wants..
2010-12-01T21:02:50  <burny> choose planet to attack absed on a function of population, distance, and growth
2010-12-01T21:03:27  <meneky> j3camero: i'd love to create a test bot for it :)
2010-12-01T21:03:33  <burny> j3, what happens with people who enter the game much later?.. how is the metric for scoring done?
2010-12-01T21:04:51  <burny> ai for something like gauntlet could be interesting
2010-12-01T21:05:09  <meneky> but no clue on how to make an ai challenge from a MMORTS (a fair one)
2010-12-01T21:05:31  <burny> random level, random 3 team-mates.. and the goal is to make your bot, work well with all other bot types
2010-12-01T21:06:47  <meneky> but the problem with more than 2 players is that you dont really depend on your actions and one enemy, algo depends on the balance of quality between the other two players
2010-12-01T21:07:14  <meneky> or am i missing something obvious?
2010-12-01T21:07:39  <eburnette> "Think Lisp is a dead language? Not according to Gábor Melis, who was just announced as the winner of the PlanetWars Google AI challenge."
2010-12-01T21:07:43  <burny> meneky ya.. it would be different ai :P
2010-12-01T21:07:54  <j3camero> I was thinking every time someone conquered more than 50% of the map they would "win" and the game would start over again. The final tournament would consist of one or more games of this sort.
2010-12-01T21:08:07  <j3camero> So it just automatically starts over once somebody wins.
2010-12-01T21:08:21  <burny> that's not really an 'mmo' then :P
2010-12-01T21:08:28  <j3camero> eburnette where did you get that?
2010-12-01T21:08:40  <burny> it'd be hilareous though..

2010-12-01T21:11:01  <meneky> noes
2010-12-01T21:11:22  <burny> well, I played warcraft 3 a bunch..
2010-12-01T21:11:27  <burny> and there's 4-6 people per map
2010-12-01T21:11:41  <burny> and the top players, win like 80-90% of the time
2010-12-01T21:11:59  <burny> I won about 50% of the time
2010-12-01T21:12:26  <burny> there are luck elements..
2010-12-01T21:12:36  <burny> but it is highly skill based, if the game is balanced right
2010-12-01T21:12:47  <burny> planetwars doesn't work, because of the method of balance
2010-12-01T21:13:07  <virdo> With multiple players though -- wonder if you should worry about collusion more.
2010-12-01T21:13:13  <burny> you can't "make defenses" in planetwars, for instance

2010-12-01T21:15:00  <burny> it needs to be fair: and also balanced correctly(to remain interesting)
2010-12-01T21:15:56  <a1k0n_> next contest should be minecraft AI
2010-12-01T21:16:01  <burny> meneky, the thing that makes "real RTS's" be pheasible for FFA's.. is that 2 players, can bring the exact same army into battle.. and one loses 25/25 units, while the other loses 3/25
2010-12-01T21:16:05  <meneky> a game far more interesting that chess go an the like
2010-12-01T21:17:11  <burny> and an exampel of a game with poor balance.. is the original starcraft..
2010-12-01T21:17:23  <burny> I could win 6vs1 against the AI in that game
2010-12-01T21:17:30  <virdo> You know what? I think you should post something to forums so people can discuss this ;) -- How many players per game/map? How long for it to be "over"? Victory conditions? etc :)
2010-12-01T21:17:33  <burny> could never manage to win 7vs1 though
2010-12-01T21:17:54  <virdo> Holy crap, you kicked so much SC butt? or are you talking about FFA specifically?
2010-12-01T21:18:06  <burny> no.. 6vs1, not ffa
2010-12-01T21:18:24  <burny> starcraft ai wasn't terribly good at playing
2010-12-01T21:18:36  <a1k0n_> starcraft's AI definitely kicked my ass
2010-12-01T21:18:38  <virdo> It whooped my ass ;)
2010-12-01T21:18:41  <burny> it could beat most people though

2010-12-01T21:18:57  <burny> right
2010-12-01T21:19:20  <burny> 6vs 1 I'd kill 4 of them, by time 2 of them teamed up on me, and they'd take my base, but I'd have 3 others
2010-12-01T21:19:37  <virdo> but they're teamed up from the get go burny :)

2010-12-01T21:22:25  <virdo> Ok, but you're giving confusing information... If you played team mode, 6 v 1 -- such that 6 AIs vs just you -- and you managed to fight them off, that's awesome! :)
2010-12-01T21:22:49  <burny> yes, it was 6AI players, against me
2010-12-01T21:23:02  <burny> I'd win about 40% of the time
2010-12-01T21:23:05  <virdo> but from the sounds of you, you're either talking about team games (3v3/4v4?) or FFA, which makes it quite different :)
2010-12-01T21:23:10  <burny> 1vs3 I'd win about 99% of the time
2010-12-01T21:23:30  <burny> ya, in warcraft3.. I played FFA( 4-6 players)

2010-12-01T21:28:55  <burny> so for an FFA rts game, it's be pretty easy to give it decent level of balance, just by making themap layout, be so that bots are paired together(and basically have to kill each other, before expanding further).. then they meet another bot who won a mini best of 2, before they expand into a larger area, etc.
2010-12-01T21:29:43  <virdo> How many bots per map/game?
2010-12-01T21:29:57  <burny> could do as many as ya want really
2010-12-01T21:30:00  <virdo> I recall someone mentioning MMO, but..
2010-12-01T21:30:15  <burny> ya.. I don't think MMO would work, without massive game tweaks
2010-12-01T21:30:42  <virdo> Well, how fast does a game resolve itself? Current planet wars was what, more or less 200 seconds max?
2010-12-01T21:31:10  <burny> however fast you make it be?

2010-12-01T21:33:28  <j3camero> I think we should all go over and help get the .p2p project going. Wouldn't it be awesome to have the entire DNS system out of government control?

2010-12-01T21:34:10  <burny> real time just means you don't get infinite time to make descision

2010-12-01T21:39:06  <burny> spades is a fixed 2vs2
2010-12-01T21:39:48  <a1k0n_> sheepshead is kinda somewhere between spades and hearts, best played with 5.  it's played a lot in wisconsin, and not a lot elsewhere

2010-12-01T22:01:08  <burny> to conenct to the service initially requires a known server(or port scanning)
2010-12-01T22:01:27  <burny> once conencted.. it uses dns like service, to remain in the loop

2010-12-01T22:11:50  <sigh> "Bocsimako is the proof that lisp is best for AI algorithms," haha, someone actually said this?
2010-12-01T22:12:11  <burny> lol
2010-12-01T22:12:15  <burny> stupid press
2010-12-01T22:12:36  <burny> because anything is 'the best'..
2010-12-01T22:12:49  <flag> Where is this article that you're reading?
2010-12-01T22:13:21  <sigh> eburnette is writing an article and posting extracts here
2010-12-01T22:13:54  <eburnette> >> Bocsimacko debuted in the official contest ratings on October 22nd. Two days later, it was in the top spot and never looked back.
2010-12-01T22:14:31  <flag> sigh: ok
2010-12-01T22:14:44  <eburnette> "2010-11-22T18:25:07  <nullkuhl> bosimacko is the proof that lisp is best for ai algorithms :P"
2010-12-01T22:15:08  <flag> "The contest quickly became a race for second place"
2010-12-01T22:15:13  <sigh> ah, the ":P" gives the statement a whole new meaning
2010-12-01T22:16:18  <jmcarthur> maybe you should just write it and then paste a link here?
2010-12-01T22:16:20  <jmcarthur> ;)
2010-12-01T22:17:01  <eburnette> "2010-10-22T18:11:17  <contestbot> Top 10 players: Hazard(4090), rsergio(4059), felixcoto(4052), asavis(4030), cfaftw(4001), sin_sun(3977), dmj111(3972), bocsimacko(3917), davidjliu(3893), RebelXT(3889)" was first appearance of bocsimacko I could find on irc logs
2010-12-01T22:17:28  <eburnette> Whatever happened to Hazard? He was doing pretty well at first.

2010-12-01T22:18:27  <sigh> oh jmcarthur, what happened to your awesome algorithm?
2010-12-01T22:18:51  <burny> in fps's, and lots of other things.. I dominate for the first few minutes, and then get owned as other people get comfortable with the new situation
2010-12-01T22:20:47  <jmcarthur> sigh: i don't believe i ever claimed awesomeness
2010-12-01T22:20:51  <jmcarthur> i didn't finish it
2010-12-01T22:20:54  <jmcarthur> i quit early
2010-12-01T22:21:11  <sigh> ah too bad
2010-12-01T22:21:19  <jmcarthur> this was taking too much of my time when i could have been focusing on more productive things
2010-12-01T22:21:31  <sigh> what were you actually planning. I just remember you being very secretive :P
2010-12-01T22:21:37  <jmcarthur> i believe i did explain what i was doing at one point
2010-12-01T22:21:41  <eburnette> flag I added your line, thanks
2010-12-01T22:21:55  <eburnette> >> When asked about his language choice, Gábor responded "I'm thankful to have been programming in Lisp professionally for 6 years." He says he tried Java but found it "incredibly boring".
2010-12-01T22:22:01  <jmcarthur> i was being secretive not because i thought it would work but because i just wanted something unique ;)
2010-12-01T22:22:14  <sigh> :)
2010-12-01T22:23:07  <jmcarthur> anyway, it was just a partical swarm optimization thing with a couple novel ideas about how to map strategies to positions in the search space and making the thing play nice with some game theory concepts
2010-12-01T22:23:12  <eburnette> >> He is a senior developer for RavenPack, a privately held firm specializing in computer algorithms that parse news feeds to create models for stock trading programs.
2010-12-01T22:23:56  <flag> eburnette: no problem
2010-12-01T22:24:18  <jmcarthur> the search space was basically "what proportion of my available ships do i want to send from planet A to planet B on turn N?", with a heuristic for figuring out what planets to send the ships *from* during the fitness test, which was basically a complete run of the game
2010-12-01T22:24:31  <jmcarthur> there were two swarms going simulataneously trying to beat each other
2010-12-01T22:25:15  <sigh> hmm... sounds complicated o_O
2010-12-01T22:25:17  <jmcarthur> and the update functions were probabilistic based on mixed strategies computed from running all the positions of one swarm against all the positions of the other
2010-12-01T22:25:27  <jmcarthur> yeah that's why it was taking so much of my time :\
2010-12-01T22:26:08  <jmcarthur> i had implemented most of the parts in isolation but quite before i got them integrated together
2010-12-01T22:26:14  <jmcarthur> s/quite/quit/
2010-12-01T22:26:26  <antimatroid> afternoon
2010-12-01T22:26:27  <sigh> ah, too bad
2010-12-01T22:26:31  <antimatroid> congrats people
2010-12-01T22:26:31  <sigh> hey antimatroid
2010-12-01T22:26:51  <jmcarthur> i did expect that it would do... decently
2010-12-01T22:27:03  <jmcarthur> assuming i could run enough simulations in one second
2010-12-01T22:27:20  <jmcarthur> the first several turns would be bad though
2010-12-01T22:27:23  <jmcarthur> and those are critical
2010-12-01T22:27:32  <jmcarthur> so i would have probably had to implement some heuristics for those
2010-12-01T22:27:47  <jmcarthur> and then switch over to the PSO AI once it had enough meaningful iterations
2010-12-01T22:27:47  <sigh> you can always hack the first few turns with something like knapsack and then switch :P
2010-12-01T22:27:51  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-12-01T22:28:24  <sigh> antimatroid: so you working on aarima now?
2010-12-01T22:28:51  <antimatroid> sigh: the comp starts in a month, i think i'm going to slowly work on one for the following year
2010-12-01T22:28:59  <antimatroid> i can't afford to spent another month doing nothing else
2010-12-01T22:29:07  <sigh> haha
2010-12-01T22:29:12  <burny> just make one in 4days :P

2010-12-01T22:40:07  <eburnette> >> The first one was Minesweeper Flags, followed by Rock Paper Scissors, and then Tron. Yes, they actually had a contest writing programs to play Rock Paper Scissors. "RPS is harder than you think," says Jeff. "It's not random. It was iterated RPS."
2010-12-01T22:42:02  <Zannick> you probably should ask jeff what he meant by iterated
2010-12-01T22:42:17  <pgpaskar_> trials were not independent
2010-12-01T22:42:28  <Zannick> right
2010-12-01T22:42:36  <pgpaskar_> ie. you would play 200-2000 games in the same process
2010-12-01T22:42:43  <pgpaskar_> so you could "track" your enemy and predict them etc
2010-12-01T22:42:45  <a1k0n_> and amstan won
2010-12-01T22:42:54  <antimatroid> amstan won rps yeah?
2010-12-01T22:43:03  <pgpaskar_> Yeah
2010-12-01T22:43:13  <antimatroid> i don't see how that's anything other than who has the best random number generator

2010-12-01T22:43:36  <Azrathud> Agh. Wrong channel.
2010-12-01T22:43:55  <pgpaskar_> antimatroid: because randomness wins you 33% of the games
2010-12-01T22:43:58  <pgpaskar_> ties are not wins
2010-12-01T22:44:06  <pgpaskar_> you have to be /better/ tahn random.
2010-12-01T22:44:07  <burny> basically.. a random bot, will just always be at 50% wins..
2010-12-01T22:44:08  <a1k0n_> how do you accidentally pick #aichallenge?
2010-12-01T22:44:16  <burny> if you want to do better.. you have to play not just random
2010-12-01T22:44:21  <burny> and there in lies the contest
2010-12-01T22:44:25  <pgpaskar_> It won't be 50% wins
2010-12-01T22:44:30  <pgpaskar_> there are 3 outcomes: loss, win, tie
2010-12-01T22:44:33  <pgpaskar_> ties are NOT wins
2010-12-01T22:44:38  <burny> whatever.. 50% score
2010-12-01T22:44:47  <pgpaskar_> ...that's not right though
2010-12-01T22:44:50  <pgpaskar_> ._.
2010-12-01T22:45:10  <burny> if I play rps pure random, and you play rps with ANY sort of strategy..
2010-12-01T22:45:21  <burny> we will win, tie, and lose, 33% of the time
2010-12-01T22:46:03  <pgpaskar_> but you're not pure random
2010-12-01T22:46:05  <pgpaskar_> that's the point
2010-12-01T22:46:21  <burny> uh ya.. that's what I was saying...
2010-12-01T22:46:30  <pgpaskar_> but its not random vs random
2010-12-01T22:46:32  <burny> random is 50%, and thus, random can't possibly be the best strategy
2010-12-01T22:46:45  <burny> thus, people will make SOME sort of strategy..

2010-12-01T22:47:16  <a1k0n_> iterated rps!

2010-12-01T22:49:44  <antimatroid> if it is, it's luck on the first move
2010-12-01T22:49:50  <antimatroid> or both bots just suck
2010-12-01T22:49:55  <burny> even something as simple as crazy 8's, can be won 80%+ of the time
2010-12-01T22:50:55  <antimatroid> pgpaskar_: so what was the winning strategy for repeated rps? tit for tat?
2010-12-01T22:51:23  <pgpaskar_> A stupidly complicated prediction-antiprediction-prediction-randomness bot
2010-12-01T22:51:29  <a1k0n_> everyone copied some canonical algorithm with their own tweaks (hey, just like in tron)
2010-12-01T22:51:41  <sigh> antimatroid: how can you tit-for-tat in rps?
2010-12-01T22:51:42  <pgpaskar_> It had prediction techniques, prediction of prediction techniques, and a good random number generator
2010-12-01T22:51:56  <pgpaskar_> and then it mix-and-matched these with meta-predictors to determine which would work best

2010-12-01T22:56:08  <antimatroid> Prillicy: some time earlyish next year is the best guess
2010-12-01T22:56:15  <Prillicy> I can't wait
2010-12-01T22:56:28  <Prillicy> will it be announced on the same site?
2010-12-01T22:56:39  <antimatroid> i have a game theory library in c++, i was going to separate it so headers were a hell of a lot cleaner, i guess not
2010-12-01T22:56:42  <virdo> Do it over Christmas break -- some of us will have more time during this period :P

2010-12-01T22:57:31  <antimatroid> i like 2 player simultaneous games, but i don't want another one simply dominated with minimax
2010-12-01T22:57:38  <Prillicy> I'll keep checking in here...and I'd lose my life if I played minecraft.

2010-12-01T22:58:08  <burny> bocs wasn't minimax was it?
2010-12-01T22:58:17  <antimatroid> no
2010-12-01T22:58:27  <jmcarthur> we should do something with 16 players at a time
2010-12-01T22:58:29  <burny> tron was though right?
2010-12-01T22:58:44  <burny> I agree, multi player is tons more interesting
2010-12-01T22:58:46  <antimatroid> i'm down for that, but as soon as you have more than 2 players, the games become a lot harder
2010-12-01T22:58:51  <sigh> it uses minimax to some extent, I think
2010-12-01T22:58:51  <jmcarthur> exactly

2010-12-01T22:59:00  <antimatroid> sigh: only on the first turn
2010-12-01T22:59:08  <jmcarthur> you either have difficulty or you have minimax
2010-12-01T22:59:08  <burny> should also give some sort of minimal form in which the bots can communicate
2010-12-01T22:59:12  <sigh> to some extent :P
2010-12-01T22:59:53  <jmcarthur> i think a game with hidden state would be good (you don't always know what the opponent has or is capable of)

2010-12-01T23:01:44  <jmcarthur> https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B3_Nay8FIDhVNWMxNjk1OTItMWMwMi00NDMyLWFjNzMtMGI2ZjI0MmU2Yzhj&hl=en
2010-12-01T23:01:53  <antimatroid> you could let them choose their starting private information, then it'd be bayesian
2010-12-01T23:02:05  <jmcarthur> the hidden information part was the first bullet point under Variations

2010-12-01T23:02:44  <jmcarthur> basically if an opponent goes behind a wall and the emerges later you don't necessarily know how much charge they have
2010-12-01T23:02:47  <jmcarthur> *and then
2010-12-01T23:04:03  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i like that, although why not do it all continously without turn time limits?
2010-12-01T23:04:12  <antimatroid> let players call for adjustments and fire as they please
2010-12-01T23:04:14  <virdo> summary: asteroids -- but against other bots and walls / other stuff on the map? ;)
2010-12-01T23:04:40  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it just gets tougher that way, and some people would cry foul because their language is slow than others...

2010-12-01T23:04:48  <burny> multiplayer shooter
2010-12-01T23:04:48  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i personally would be all for it as long as the engine is fair
2010-12-01T23:05:02  <antimatroid> can one do clock cycles and make it fair for languages?
2010-12-01T23:05:13  <antimatroid> i have no idea about those kind of things
2010-12-01T23:05:29  <jmcarthur> not sure what you mean. you mean give each bot exactly the same number of clock cycles?
2010-12-01T23:05:32  <jmcarthur> it's hard
2010-12-01T23:05:32  <burny> languages are fair..
2010-12-01T23:05:43  <burny> ease of deveopment vs performance, etc.
2010-12-01T23:05:57  <burny> if onelanguage is better.. us eit
2010-12-01T23:06:06  <antimatroid> i like the idea of self programmed weapons that meet some conditions
2010-12-01T23:06:10  <virdo> I wonder --- instead of giving a second, maybe you give: you have max 200 seconds left... and communicate that back to the bot... so, if a bot realizes they're slow, they can do less stuff per turn?
2010-12-01T23:06:13  <antimatroid> so you don't even know exactly what their weapons will do
2010-12-01T23:06:28  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yeah i was trying to think of a sensible way to put something like that into my idea
2010-12-01T23:06:40  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2010-12-01T23:07:06  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'd say let people write some kind of "missile script" that the weapons start their own instance of and that then does it's own thing
2010-12-01T23:07:27  <sigh> weapon with AI?
2010-12-01T23:07:33  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-12-01T23:07:38  <burny> I think a good method to make cpu time work..
2010-12-01T23:07:43  <burny> is a per turn, and per game, limit
2010-12-01T23:07:44  <antimatroid> like writing your own program for your red shell in mario kart
2010-12-01T23:07:47  <sigh> so now you are meta-programming in your AI :P
2010-12-01T23:07:54  <antimatroid> and the shell follows the program you wrote for it before expiring
2010-12-01T23:08:01  <burny> so each turn is limited to 1second, and the full game is limited to 10seconds, or some such
2010-12-01T23:08:13  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: you mean you can give the weapon a different program every time you fire?
2010-12-01T23:08:20  <jmcarthur> because that would rock
2010-12-01T23:08:22  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: sure
2010-12-01T23:08:40  <antimatroid> you could write 10 different scripts for it if you wanted, then dependent on the state send out the weapon you want
2010-12-01T23:08:41  <jmcarthur> sounds hard :)
2010-12-01T23:08:45  <antimatroid> exactly :)
2010-12-01T23:08:57  <sigh> however, I do think that simple rules are better for this kind of contest
2010-12-01T23:09:22  <virdo> yes, simple rules, local testing, instant gratification!
2010-12-01T23:09:31  <antimatroid> what if there were always 2 tournys in the future
2010-12-01T23:09:36  <jmcarthur> i agree to an extent
2010-12-01T23:09:40  <antimatroid> very similar games, but one simplified a lot for beginners?
2010-12-01T23:09:43  <jmcarthur> eh
2010-12-01T23:10:00  <jmcarthur> i'm not a fan of the idea. i think beginners would never want to play in the beginner bracket
2010-12-01T23:10:05  <burny> I had the same idea anti
2010-12-01T23:10:17  <jmcarthur> s/think/expect/
2010-12-01T23:10:18  <antimatroid> burny: i think i was the one saying it was bad to you :P
2010-12-01T23:10:28  <antimatroid> and i still semi agree, but i want HARD games damnit :(
2010-12-01T23:10:34  <jmcarthur> yeah me too
2010-12-01T23:10:35  <burny> I'd say the way to do it..is make the 'beginner bracket' have simplified rules, that guide them to tuning a portion of their ai
2010-12-01T23:10:51  <sigh> antimatroid: would you say planetwars was easy or hard?
2010-12-01T23:10:53  <virdo> antimatroid: wasn't this a HARD game?
2010-12-01T23:11:05  <antimatroid> virdo: yes
2010-12-01T23:11:10  <burny> eg. if it's a 2vs2 game.. it will tell you which player is the 'leader' and 'follower'.. and you're intended to write both modes, and test them independantly
2010-12-01T23:11:11  <antimatroid> sigh: hard
2010-12-01T23:11:21  <burny> but in the 'real' game.. it' sup to the bots to decide who is leading
2010-12-01T23:11:28  <sigh> anyway, rule complexity doesn't have much corrolation with game difficulty
2010-12-01T23:11:34  <jmcarthur> sigh: exactly!
2010-12-01T23:11:43  <antimatroid> if map sizes were smaller for this some much cooler programs would have been made
2010-12-01T23:11:50  <antimatroid> but the games would have been less cool
2010-12-01T23:12:06  <antimatroid> did anyone ever get a general solution for 3 planet maps?
2010-12-01T23:12:25  <sigh> but simple rules has a lot of benefits, low barrier for entry, easier to create a balanced game, easier to make tools (such as visualisers)
2010-12-01T23:12:34  <burny> I think the best would have been if it wasn't symetrical.. and each pair played 2 games.. and the bot that wins the fastest(or wins both), wins
2010-12-01T23:12:36  <antimatroid> i had like a page of algebra at one point trying to set up players expected utilities and equating etc. and it was just so messy with all the parameters
2010-12-01T23:12:36  <virdo> general solution? depends on location of planets, no? and their growth / ship counts? :)
2010-12-01T23:12:39  <eburnette> Did google sponsor the RPS and Minesweeper contests too? j3camero
2010-12-01T23:13:17  <antimatroid> virdo: a general solution would just assign general parameters for those values
2010-12-01T23:13:37  <antimatroid> you might need some kind of composite thing for different types of games
2010-12-01T23:13:49  <antimatroid> but a general solution in mixed strategies exists
2010-12-01T23:14:32  <virdo> so you're saying a starting planet for both players, and a central planet? and that's it?
2010-12-01T23:14:47  <antimatroid> yep, any kind of isosceles triangle
2010-12-01T23:14:53  <burny> if planetwars was about winning fast.. rather than just winning.. it would have required much more interesting strategies
2010-12-01T23:15:09  <virdo> burny: it was already tough enough as it was :)
2010-12-01T23:15:11  <flag> antimatroid: So basically, wait till enemy tries to take neutral and steal it?
2010-12-01T23:15:21  <antimatroid> flag: not always
2010-12-01T23:15:26  <virdo> yeah, not always...
2010-12-01T23:15:40  <virdo> what if growth > ship count? :)
2010-12-01T23:15:48  <antimatroid> it depends on whether them sniping you leaves them vulnerable to you then sniping their home
2010-12-01T23:15:50  <antimatroid> or ^^
2010-12-01T23:16:08  <antimatroid> hmm, i guess that can't happen
2010-12-01T23:16:16  <flag> Yeah...
2010-12-01T23:16:31  <burny> ya it can
2010-12-01T23:16:31  <virdo> which? growth > ship count? of course it can?
2010-12-01T23:16:39  <antimatroid> no, my example
2010-12-01T23:16:42  <antimatroid> yours is fine
2010-12-01T23:17:02  <antimatroid> you can get some complicated 3 planet maps with that feature, but not as many
2010-12-01T23:17:07  <flag> In virdo's case then you would go for the neutral
2010-12-01T23:17:16  <antimatroid> flag: depends where centre is
2010-12-01T23:17:32  <flag> Unless of course the enemy could then kill your home
2010-12-01T23:17:33  <virdo> well, the only other case I see is this... if distance to neutral planet x 2 == distance between players... you could send 100% fleet to neutral, and still make it back in time to defend your home base, right?
2010-12-01T23:17:38  <antimatroid> if you send everything at the neutral leaving your home planet vulnerable, you lose
2010-12-01T23:17:59  <flag> Basically, take as much as you can without leaving anything vulnerable
2010-12-01T23:18:29  <antimatroid> hmm, the real question is, does there exist 3 planet rps situations?
2010-12-01T23:18:42  <burny> non-equal games, with metrics on who won by how much: makes for very interesting AI imo
2010-12-01T23:19:06  <antimatroid> burny: i agree, but the process of ranking bots also gets harder
2010-12-01T23:19:27  <burny> rank based on how much they won, vs how much they were expected to win by
2010-12-01T23:19:48  <flag> So if his_home_number_ships > your_ships + distance_to_enemy*your_growth_rate - the_fleet_youre_sending : don't send the fleet
2010-12-01T23:20:29  <flag> or, if neutral_num_ships > neutral_growth_rate and enemy_incoming[neutral] < neutral_num_ships : don't send the fleet
2010-12-01T23:20:48  <flag> otherwise: ATTACK!
2010-12-01T23:21:01  <flag> ?
2010-12-01T23:21:01  <antimatroid> not sure about that second part being equivalent?
2010-12-01T23:21:07  <burny> I don't think this contest had any truely interesting ai's..
2010-12-01T23:21:24  <burny> interesting stuff would be like..
2010-12-01T23:21:29  <flag> So if the enemy isn'
2010-12-01T23:21:49  <flag> t attacking the neutral, and the number of ships at it is greater than the growth rate, don't attack it either
2010-12-01T23:21:51  <burny> a planet has 40 ships, but you know the opponent will snipe it if you hit it.. but it's the best move you can make..
2010-12-01T23:21:57  <flag> Also don't attack if your home planet can be sniped
2010-12-01T23:22:14  <burny> attack it with 20, expecting the enemy will then decide to finish it off, and claim the growth..
2010-12-01T23:22:26  *** MikeTV <MikeTV!451d4411@gateway/web/freenode/ip.69.29.68.17> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-01T23:22:32  <flag> Or your opponent could just wait
2010-12-01T23:22:37  <burny> and then send your attack the next frame, so they won't get to temporarily own it
2010-12-01T23:22:42  <flag> And you'd lose at 200 moves due to less ships
2010-12-01T23:22:51  <dmj111> doh.
2010-12-01T23:22:52  <antimatroid> if i go for a neutral, i send either 1 more than they could possibly send in that time, or everything i can if it's equal to what they can
2010-12-01T23:23:22  <antimatroid> but i wont do that last move unless neutal ships <= neutral growth
2010-12-01T23:23:38  <flag> Are we still talking about the map with 3 planets?
2010-12-01T23:23:47  <burny> don't think so
2010-12-01T23:23:52  <antimatroid> that's what my strategy would do
2010-12-01T23:24:05  <antimatroid> and it'd make a tree with both players doing either options
2010-12-01T23:24:24  <flag> My strategy would wait for the opponent to attack the planet neutral and go from there
2010-12-01T23:24:25  <antimatroid> although my tree is broken, fix up that and my bot does really really well on maps with small numbers of planets
2010-12-01T23:24:26  <burny> 3planet map is pretty trivial to solve
2010-12-01T23:24:44  <burny> what if hte planet is closer to the opponent than yourself?
2010-12-01T23:24:44  <flag> burny: That's what I'm saying
2010-12-01T23:24:52  <flag> Then it's not a fair map?
2010-12-01T23:24:59  <antimatroid> i spent time tweaking my bot for small maps such that i couldn't beat it in human mode even playing perfectly
2010-12-01T23:25:11  <burny> so? life isn't fair
2010-12-01T23:25:15  <virdo> antimatroid: unless it's RPS type of situation?
2010-12-01T23:25:27  <antimatroid> virdo: then it's up for anyone :P
2010-12-01T23:25:34  <flag> What if I start with 1000 ships and you start with 4?
2010-12-01T23:25:40  <flag> :)
2010-12-01T23:25:47  <antimatroid> i originally had my tree tie braking randomly, but as the game was already so messy, i got sick of a bot making different moves all the time
2010-12-01T23:26:09  <sigh> flag: there was a game posted on the forum where someone came back from having 1 ship on 1 planet :P
2010-12-01T23:26:18  <virdo> not deterministic? mine wasn't either, even though I tried to sort by planet IDs and stuff ;)
2010-12-01T23:26:20  <antimatroid> that's amazing
2010-12-01T23:26:25  <burny> what if you star with 1000ships and I start with 4.. but I start with 20grow, and you start with 0
2010-12-01T23:26:41  <flag> Then I send everything I have at you and win
2010-12-01T23:26:49  <antimatroid> depends on distance
2010-12-01T23:26:55  <virdo> antimatroid: he said 0 growth
2010-12-01T23:26:56  <antimatroid> but it's a pretty clear strategy depending on parameters
2010-12-01T23:26:57  <virdo> send it all :)
2010-12-01T23:27:03  <flag> Unless the distance between me and you is greater than (1000 - 4)/20
2010-12-01T23:27:10  <flag> Or something like that
2010-12-01T23:27:17  <sigh> this is the game: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8584510
2010-12-01T23:27:20  <sigh> (move 26) :P
2010-12-01T23:27:40  <burny> what if you start beside a 1cost 5grow planet?.. you wouldn't take that first?
2010-12-01T23:27:46  <antimatroid> i think symmetric maps are fine
2010-12-01T23:28:03  <burny> ya, symmetry is ok.. but I think non symm is a lot more interesting
2010-12-01T23:28:08  <antimatroid> that game is awesome
2010-12-01T23:28:17  <flag> burny: Well if you keep changing the map then yeah, my bot would do different things.
2010-12-01T23:28:50  <burny> I never said or sugested the map has only 2 planets
2010-12-01T23:29:24  <virdo> I think we should brainstorm on the next challenge -- or we can rehash planet wars more ;) - different growth planets, fog of war, sacrificing your troops to increase growth production, multiple players, moving planets, 3d, ... :D
2010-12-01T23:29:24  <burny> 1000+0 vs 4+20, could be an interesting cat and mouse game..
2010-12-01T23:29:33  <antimatroid> what would be interesting is if every neutral was non-snipable on the first turn :P
2010-12-01T23:29:35  <burny> the 4+20 is tryng to buidl the best defensive path..
2010-12-01T23:29:39  <antimatroid> including centre planets
2010-12-01T23:29:45  <burny> while hte opponent is trying to build the best attack path
2010-12-01T23:29:48  <eburnette> Ok guys, the article is finally finished.
2010-12-01T23:30:00  <antimatroid> i wanted to construct a map that would result in bots just chasing each other around a circle of planets
2010-12-01T23:30:19  <burny> if center planets werne't snipable on first turn, they would probably too superior to the rest of the map
2010-12-01T23:30:19  <eburnette> Gosh these things take a long time to write. Anyway thanks for your input...
2010-12-01T23:30:35  <eburnette> Url is http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/hungarian-lisp-developer-walks-away-with-google-ai-contest/2131
2010-12-01T23:30:42  <burny> causign the primary strategy to be, deciding which panets to hit on first turn, and how many to send to each
2010-12-01T23:31:15  <burny> but whoever expands to the middle with a sufficiently strong force first, will win most certainly

2010-12-01T23:32:16  <burny> if enough bots were sufficently good.. this game would devolve into RPS
2010-12-01T23:32:51  <sigh> if enough bots are sufficiently good, then chess is a trivial game :P
2010-12-01T23:33:05  <virdo> :)
2010-12-01T23:33:45  <burny> true.. but it's not pheasible to be good enough at chess, currently
2010-12-01T23:33:57  <antimatroid> that's the point :P
2010-12-01T23:34:35  <burny> oh ya.. I forgot, that it's not general concensus, that this game is solvable
2010-12-01T23:35:12  <virdo> watch burny create a bot that beats bocsi tonight :)
2010-12-01T23:35:15  <antimatroid> depends what you mean by solvable
2010-12-01T23:35:20  <burny> why bother?
2010-12-01T23:35:23  <virdo> burny, RPS alone suggests it isn't?
2010-12-01T23:35:31  <virdo> chess, however, is :)
2010-12-01T23:35:45  <antimatroid> virdo: there exists a solution in mixed strategies
2010-12-01T23:36:04  <burny> if you devolve it into RPS, and th eopponent doesn't.. then you win
2010-12-01T23:36:20  <antimatroid> ... on average
2010-12-01T23:36:35  <sigh> well going by the previous conversation that's not the whole story... optimal mixed strategy for rps is pure randomness
2010-12-01T23:36:55  <jmcarthur> for rps with no information about your opponent, you mean
2010-12-01T23:36:57  <sigh> but people did better, because other opponents weren't random
2010-12-01T23:36:57  <virdo> ??? whole idea is A > B > C > A -- so, if you do A, and enemy does B, you win... but if they do C, they win... ?
2010-12-01T23:37:04  <antimatroid> sigh: that's a different game
2010-12-01T23:37:07  <virdo> sigh: but then by definition it's not solvable? :)
2010-12-01T23:37:14  <burny> pure random is NOT the best(nor CAN be the best)
2010-12-01T23:37:17  <antimatroid> there is a big difference between repeated games with known and unknown opponents
2010-12-01T23:37:27  <antimatroid> unknown is equivalent to single instances of a game pretty much
2010-12-01T23:37:36  <antimatroid> if you're doing that, then you can't do better than complete randomisation
2010-12-01T23:37:39  <sigh> fair enough
2010-12-01T23:37:47  <virdo> uhm, but we're tlaking here about Planet Wars, yes? So, given a RPS styled map, and you're playing with an opponent, how can it be solvable?

2010-12-01T23:37:58  <virdo> or wait, I take it back.
2010-12-01T23:38:00  <antimatroid> virdeo: you use a mixed strategy
2010-12-01T23:38:28  <eburnette> l8r guys, maybe cya next contest
2010-12-01T23:38:29  <sigh> yes, you optimise *expected* outcome
2010-12-01T23:38:33  <burny> virdo, the thing is if the opponent DOESN"T know, that it is rps
2010-12-01T23:38:56  <virdo> eburnette: l8r!
2010-12-01T23:38:58  <antimatroid> eburnette: see ya :)
2010-12-01T23:39:01  <antimatroid> still reading your post

2010-12-01T23:39:41  <burny> for instance, if I ask you for the square root of 3.. and the answer field is an integer..
2010-12-01T23:39:53  <sigh> integers aren't a field :P
2010-12-01T23:39:59  <burny> you can basically choose 1, or 2, or can choose to not give an answer
2010-12-01T23:40:06  * sigh hides
2010-12-01T23:40:17  <antimatroid> hehe
2010-12-01T23:40:42  <burny> and if one of those 3 at random, is the 'right' answer.. and my bot knows this, and yours doesn't..
2010-12-01T23:40:59  <burny> then I can guess your answer is most likely to be either 1 or 2..
2010-12-01T23:41:07  <antimatroid> burny: you need multiplicative inverses for a field :) 2 * x = 1 doesn't have a solution in your set
2010-12-01T23:41:12  <burny> and then choose whatever answer doesn't lose to the 1 and 2
2010-12-01T23:41:31  <burny> :P
2010-12-01T23:41:36  <burny> I don't know math stuff
2010-12-01T23:41:48  <sigh> sorry, I was just making a joke
2010-12-01T23:41:58  <burny> ya, I didn't get it till anti said his bit
2010-12-01T23:41:59  <antimatroid> yeah, and i was painfully explaining :)
2010-12-01T23:43:08  <virdo> What's solvable to you anyways? Guaranteed a win or stalemate at worst? or, knowing that if I do A and enemy does B, I will win, but if I do A and enemy does C, I will lose?
2010-12-01T23:43:37  <antimatroid> solvable is finding a nash equilibrium
2010-12-01T23:43:54  <antimatroid> well for these 2 player zero sum games
2010-12-01T23:44:05  <virdo> antimatroid: so... the first part of what I wrote? or the second? :)
2010-12-01T23:44:20  <burny> breakign it down to an at-worst, paper rock scissors scneario
2010-12-01T23:44:26  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has joined #aichallenge
2010-12-01T23:44:46  <burny> which is probably the same thign as what anti just said
2010-12-01T23:44:51  <antimatroid> virdeo: either picking your pure strategy, or assigning a probability distribution over your pure strategies that is playing a nash equilibrium
2010-12-01T23:44:59  <jmcarthur> a game is solved if you have a general algorithm for finding an optimal strategy. bonus points if the algorithm actually terminates before you die of old age
2010-12-01T23:45:09  <jmcarthur> :)
2010-12-01T23:45:16  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i disagree :P
2010-12-01T23:45:22  <antimatroid> a game is solved once you get the strategy
2010-12-01T23:45:38  <antimatroid> i could write you a program do find the optimal strategy in chess, does that mean i've solved it?
2010-12-01T23:45:39  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i was talking about the more general case (different maps, etc.)
2010-12-01T23:45:55  <virdo> jmcarthur: but can a planet wars RPS like situation be considered solvable? if not, that would make planet wars not solvable, quite simply, right? :)
2010-12-01T23:45:58  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: a specific map is solved by a strategy
2010-12-01T23:46:11  <antimatroid> so chess is solved?
2010-12-01T23:46:19  <jmcarthur> virdo: it's certainly *solvable*. just not necessarily within time constraints...
2010-12-01T23:46:47  <burny> no.. it's solved when the solution is deterministic, and can be solved in O(n), where n is game duration
2010-12-01T23:46:56  <virdo> jmcarthur: but what is solvable, I come back... in RPS there is no optimum strategy -- as it depends on luck? therefore, it makes the whole planet wars not solvable? am I grasping it correctly here? :)
2010-12-01T23:47:13  <antimatroid> virdo: there is an optimal strategy when you consider mixed strategies
2010-12-01T23:47:16  <virdo> ok, so planetwars is not solvable due to RPS like maps.
2010-12-01T23:47:17  <sigh> burny: why O(n)?
2010-12-01T23:47:30  <burny> if you just play through the finite number of possible non-repeat moves.. that's not 'solving' it, unless there are sufficiently few possible moves(liek tic tac toe)
2010-12-01T23:47:55  <antimatroid> tic tac toe is hard to solve still when you blow dimensions out
2010-12-01T23:47:56  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i was offering a more general definition of solvable for the purposes of a game with varying parameters. tricking me into conflating my own meaning with the traditional meaning is kind of a trap
2010-12-01T23:48:02  <antimatroid> that's my test game on my game theory library trees
2010-12-01T23:48:10  <sigh> antimatroid: luckily, you can't have more than 4
2010-12-01T23:48:26  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'm a maths student, I get ripped to pieces on things like that, it just comes naturally to me :)
2010-12-01T23:48:42  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i won't fall for it :P
2010-12-01T23:48:44  <burny> virdo, if we are playing a game of aim the sniper rifle.. and I have the game devolved down to a case of RPS.. and you have obscure huristics and what not..
2010-12-01T23:48:50  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3765), _iouri_(3565), Slin-.-(3524), _Astek_(3501), jimrogerz(3500), Accoun(3498), george(3494), GreenTea(3489), asavis(3480), bix0r4ever(3476)
2010-12-01T23:48:51  <antimatroid> my analysis lecturer said she would take marks off us if we tried to bullshit her in the exam
2010-12-01T23:48:53  <burny> then I will win, or tie, in all cases
2010-12-01T23:49:55  <burny> because if you happen to play an R or P or S.. then it's random.. but if you pick an inferior move.. I can alter my original RPS choice, to not lose
2010-12-01T23:49:57  <virdo> burny: but for RPS planetwars, you can't guarantee win or tie... you can lose too... that's the whole point of RPS :)
2010-12-01T23:50:23  <virdo> burny: you mean, by going into the past and changing your move to counter mine? wtf ;)
2010-12-01T23:50:25  <sigh> virdo: you can guarentee an expected outcome for a randomised strategy
2010-12-01T23:50:35  <sigh> and optimise that
2010-12-01T23:50:38  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: as long as i'm allowed to bind a meaning to a word without being flagged for overriding an existing definition i don't think i'm making an error here. it was merely a suggestion to adopt a more useful definition for the purposes of a game with observable but not-given-up-front parameters, that's all
2010-12-01T23:50:54  <burny> if I pick rock.. and you pick didn't pick paper..
2010-12-01T23:51:01  <burny> or rock, or scissors..
2010-12-01T23:51:03  <burny> then I win
2010-12-01T23:51:04  <jmcarthur> and perhaps i should have simply restricted it to algorithms with certain running times
2010-12-01T23:51:04  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: sorry, i wasn't trying to offend :)
2010-12-01T23:51:14  <burny> otherwise.. it wasn't an RPS situation
2010-12-01T23:51:18  <virdo> ok guys, wikipedia never lies: "A solved game is a game whose outcome can be correctly predicted from any position when each side plays optimally."... You can't play optimally on RPS map.
2010-12-01T23:51:21  <antimatroid> although i still don't like the part where it says you've solved it if you have an algorithm that will solve it in finite time
2010-12-01T23:51:36  <burny> yes you can..
2010-12-01T23:51:44  <burny> optimally in RPS sitation.. is random between R P and S
2010-12-01T23:51:49  <burny> or..
2010-12-01T23:51:53  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yeah i could have said it had to have a specific bound rather than simply be finite
2010-12-01T23:51:58  <virdo> UHM, UHM... That makes it UNSOLVABLE :)
2010-12-01T23:51:59  <antimatroid> :)
2010-12-01T23:52:01  <burny> to use knowledge of your bot.. to choose the beter of R P and S
2010-12-01T23:52:09  <antimatroid> virdo: look up what mixed strategies are
2010-12-01T23:52:12  <virdo> You cannot predict the outcome, making it not a solved game, BY DEFINITION...
2010-12-01T23:52:32  <jmcarthur> virdo: you can come up with an *expected* outcome
2010-12-01T23:52:38  <jmcarthur> virdo: "on average"
2010-12-01T23:52:51  <antimatroid> Nash provied every non-cooperative finite n-player simultaneous game has at least one mixed strategy nash equilibrium back in the 40's
2010-12-01T23:52:53  <antimatroid> a solution exists
2010-12-01T23:53:00  <burny> checkers is solved.. should red resign on first move?
2010-12-01T23:53:21  <virdo> no, because if both play perfectly, it's a draw :D
2010-12-01T23:53:27  <jmcarthur> no
2010-12-01T23:53:31  <virdo> no?
2010-12-01T23:53:40  <burny> yes..
2010-12-01T23:53:46  <burny> but the opponent is NOT playing perfectly
2010-12-01T23:53:58  <sigh> virdo: read the second paragraph of "Perfect play" section in the wikipedia page you quoted yourself
2010-12-01T23:54:02  <jmcarthur> hasn't it been shown that one of the players in checkers can always force a win?
2010-12-01T23:54:04  <sigh> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game#Perfect_play
2010-12-01T23:54:07  <virdo> "A solved game is a game whose outcome can be correctly predicted from any position when each side plays optimally." -- "each side plays optimally"
2010-12-01T23:54:07  <sigh> it talks about rps
2010-12-01T23:54:12  <burny> yes.. black wins in checkers
2010-12-01T23:54:24  <jmcarthur> virdo: ^^
2010-12-01T23:55:07  <antimatroid> virdo: you can play the optimal mixed strategy at each choice you have
2010-12-01T23:55:25  <antimatroid> hence each side plays optimally at each choice
2010-12-01T23:55:48  <jmcarthur> there's actually a whole line of research about picking strategies that give you better results when you believe your opponent is imperfect, so if you find yourself playing as red in a game of checkers that might be a good place to start
2010-12-01T23:56:02  <antimatroid> it wont give the same result for every instance of the game, but your expected payoff is optimised for the game as a whole, meaning in an infinitely repeated process with an unknown enemy, you will do optimally
2010-12-01T23:57:13  <antimatroid> having said that, finding mixed strategy nash equilibrium is a pita
2010-12-01T23:57:49  <antimatroid> you can use simplex for 2 player zero sum games, above that and you need to use things like newtons method to try and find them all or grobner bases (Which i don't understand)
2010-12-01T23:57:52  <jmcarthur> not that bad once you have a game matrix
2010-12-01T23:58:02  <jmcarthur> okay yeah, for 2 player games
2010-12-01T23:58:24  <antimatroid> i'm planning to do my thesis next year on the later :)
2010-12-01T23:58:31  <virdo> burny: from that wiki page, it says "From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with perfect play" for checkers :P
2010-12-01T23:58:33  <jmcarthur> i wasn't under the impression that non-zero sum was much harder. is it really?
2010-12-01T23:58:39  <jmcarthur> i never tried it
2010-12-01T23:58:44  <antimatroid> yes it is
2010-12-01T23:58:50  <jmcarthur> hmm, okay
2010-12-01T23:59:09  <antimatroid> in zero sum, what i gain you lose
2010-12-01T23:59:17  <antimatroid> that adds some symmetry in there somewhere
2010-12-01T23:59:29  <antimatroid> i'm mostly self taught with game theory though, so i don't know as much as i would like
2010-12-01T23:59:55  <antimatroid> symmetry probably wasn't hte right word there
