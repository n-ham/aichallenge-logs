2012-01-05T05:23:31  <guido_> hey
2012-01-05T05:23:50  <guido_> I've got a problem
2012-01-05T05:24:34  <guido_> I want to ask a question on the forum, but I can't register to the forums... I don't get an activation email
2012-01-05T05:25:42  <antimatroid> guido_: have you checked your spam folder?
2012-01-05T05:25:55  <guido_> yes i did
2012-01-05T05:26:12  <antimatroid> not sure, you'll have to ask amstan when he's around
2012-01-05T05:26:31  <guido_> hmm ok
2012-01-05T05:26:46  <guido_> are the forums still active?
2012-01-05T05:33:17  <g0llum> guido_, what about just asking here (in the meantime) ?
2012-01-05T05:33:25  <guido_> well
2012-01-05T05:34:32  <guido_> I want to do some research for a bachelor thesis, and therefor I want to use a database with all the played games in it. Then, I want to use some sort of learning algorithm to learn to play optimal
2012-01-05T05:34:53  <guido_> is there such a database?
2012-01-05T05:35:15  <antimatroid> guido_: you can get game data, but that wont be useful for playing your own games
2012-01-05T05:35:30  <antimatroid> what you can do is download other peoples bots from the forums and use those as a basis for testing the quality of your bot
2012-01-05T05:36:07  <guido_> well I want to use a algorithm that only watches other games, and learns that way
2012-01-05T05:36:44  <antimatroid> why not have it learn from its own past games?
2012-01-05T05:37:08  <antimatroid> i'm not quite sure how to actually download all the data
2012-01-05T05:37:14  <antimatroid> janzert or McLeopold would probably know
2012-01-05T05:38:14  <guido_> I want to try to let it learn from others, I hope that works better
2012-01-05T05:38:33  <antimatroid> i'm yet to see a successful learning bot
2012-01-05T05:39:14  <guido_> that's what I want to test :)
2012-01-05T05:39:28  <antimatroid> how far in are you?
2012-01-05T05:39:40  <antimatroid> i'd be way more interested in seeing a successful predictive bot
2012-01-05T05:39:55  <antimatroid> ie. a bot which predicts the moves of its opponents based on its previous moves that game

2012-01-05T05:40:18  <antimatroid> that would be extremely fruitfull with battles in ants i suspect, and should really predict timeout bots by itseld
2012-01-05T05:41:11  <guido_> That is something I would like to do. This is something it should learn
2012-01-05T05:41:28  <antimatroid> it's not going to learn it well unless you set it up to
2012-01-05T05:41:38  <guido_> Yes thats true
2012-01-05T05:41:45  <guido_> I want to use some sort of learning algoritm
2012-01-05T05:42:00  <antimatroid> that's quite vague

2012-01-05T05:42:20  <antimatroid> i've never really played around with learning, i always imagined it would be similar to writing a bot normally but then training some special parameters

2012-01-05T07:53:42  <mcstar> i had to rewrite this alg totally
2012-01-05T07:53:49  <mcstar> i had something beutiful in mind
2012-01-05T07:53:53  <ahow984_> whats the problem?
2012-01-05T07:53:59  <mcstar> but turned out, it doesnt fit the problem .(
2012-01-05T07:54:23  <mcstar> find d, such that 1/d in decimal floating point repr. has the longest digit cycle

2012-01-05T07:55:27  <mcstar> why?
2012-01-05T07:55:30  <mcstar> its easy
2012-01-05T07:55:49  <mcstar> i just spent too much time on it yesterday, cause i wanted something very elegant
2012-01-05T07:56:05  <mcstar> but today ive dont it in at most an hour
2012-01-05T07:56:11  <mcstar> done*
2012-01-05T07:56:20  <mcstar> did i tell you i had my hair cut?

2012-01-05T07:57:00  <mcstar> yep
2012-01-05T07:57:10  <ahow984_> how is it easy
2012-01-05T07:57:26  <ahow984_> I imagine recursion for checking to see if theres a pattern?
2012-01-05T07:57:56  <mcstar> it has recursion, multiple times, as usual
2012-01-05T07:58:21  <mcstar> you dont have to check for a pattern
2012-01-05T07:58:34  <mcstar> its quite long

2012-01-05T07:59:06  <mcstar> 4 of them are just import lines
2012-01-05T07:59:08  <ahow984_> lol, that'd equate to about 80 C++ I imagine :P
2012-01-05T07:59:17  <mcstar> more in this case
2012-01-05T08:00:05  <ahow984_> why don't you need to check for a pattern?
2012-01-05T08:00:12  <ahow984_> Is that not the whole idea of it?

2012-01-05T08:06:16  <ahow984_> pattern doesn't keep recurring? or it doesn't take up all of the decimal part I suppose :/
2012-01-05T08:06:22  <mcstar> ahow984_: first question, how do you intend to produce the floating point representation?
2012-01-05T08:06:53  *** mleise <mleise!~marco@dslb-088-070-156-095.pools.arcor-ip.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2012-01-05T08:07:13  <ahow984_> GMP and just for(int i=1; i<1000; i++) decimal_number = 1/i;
2012-01-05T08:07:32  <mcstar> now tell my why that wont work
2012-01-05T08:08:07  <ahow984_> nfi....
2012-01-05T08:08:14  <ahow984_> that particular line?
2012-01-05T08:08:21  <mcstar> well, ok, gmp has multiple precision floating point arithmetic, not just integer arithmetic
2012-01-05T08:08:27  <mcstar> so, you could make it work
2012-01-05T08:08:36  <ahow984_> yes
2012-01-05T08:09:09  <mcstar> i just programmed a simple integer division algorithm
2012-01-05T08:09:19  <mcstar> like the one you learn in school
2012-01-05T08:09:59  <mcstar> anyway, you get dividents all the time that you must divide by d
2012-01-05T08:10:03  <mcstar> (in 1/d)
2012-01-05T08:10:12  <ahow984_> ok
2012-01-05T08:10:21  <ahow984_> and how will that tell you if you have a pattern?
2012-01-05T08:10:37  <mcstar> and if any of that number occurs from the beginning of the list(because you collect these), you found the cycle
2012-01-05T08:11:11  <mcstar> and the rest of the list's length is basically the length of the cycle-1
2012-01-05T08:11:32  <ahow984_> lol man, you're smart at this stuff :P
2012-01-05T08:11:36  <ahow984_> how did you work out that?
2012-01-05T08:11:48  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-01-05T08:11:54  <mcstar> everybody knows how to divide
2012-01-05T08:12:13  <mcstar> the problem was, that i had something else in mind yesterday
2012-01-05T08:12:41  <mcstar> i wanted a recursive data structure, that produces the decimals as i apply "head" to it
2012-01-05T08:12:51  <mcstar> but ultimately, it would be useless
2012-01-05T08:13:02  <mcstar> (and i wasnt ready for that in haskell, either)
2012-01-05T08:13:23  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-05T08:13:35  <ahow984_> as you apply head to it :P
2012-01-05T08:13:38  <ahow984_> lol'd
2012-01-05T08:13:43  <ahow984_> I understand you though

2012-01-05T08:58:36  <mcstar> i guess it is written in c
2012-01-05T08:58:38  <ahow984_> to go from that to asm would be ridiculously challenging
2012-01-05T08:58:48  <mcstar> not really

2012-01-05T10:01:14  <mcstar> why do you think everyone wants a lame console?
2012-01-05T10:01:19  <ahow984_> would you pay for an irc client?
2012-01-05T10:01:28  <ahow984_> fine, get XChat, BitchX
2012-01-05T10:01:33  <ahow984_> something FOSS
2012-01-05T10:01:39  <mcstar> why?
2012-01-05T10:01:59  <ahow984_> because they're usually better
2012-01-05T10:02:01  <mcstar> someone put hard work into that client, and some other guy wants to pay for it
2012-01-05T10:02:02  <ahow984_> they look nice
2012-01-05T10:02:06  <ahow984_> and they're free?
2012-01-05T10:02:34  <rwest> ahow984_: they probably aren't in the mac app store since they are probably open source
2012-01-05T10:02:41  <ahow984_> I'm not saying anything against the creators of it. only against the people who buy it simply because they think it's better
2012-01-05T10:03:00  <mcstar> you dont know the reason why that guy bought it
2012-01-05T10:03:04  <ahow984_> rwest: true :/
2012-01-05T10:03:07  <mleise> I don't know which direction I should take at solving a card game. The number of card combinations is overwhelming.
2012-01-05T10:03:08  <mleise> So far I have the probabilities that a player can make a certain move.
2012-01-05T10:03:51  <mleise> But once that player actually makes a move, I know the cards he places on the table, so the probabilities for everyone change again.
2012-01-05T10:04:01  <mcstar> ahow984_: what annoys me is the message(advertising) that it leaves when it leaves
2012-01-05T10:04:14  <ahow984_> mcstar: surely you can change that?
2012-01-05T10:04:20  <rwest> mleise: card games can be done mathematically, learn combinatorics
2012-01-05T10:04:38  <mleise> For example if I knew there were 2 aces in the game, they can be spread amongst the players, but when one player places them, they are obviously gone from the game
2012-01-05T10:04:43  <mcstar> ahow984_: i dont care, i just hate them noobs spamming me
2012-01-05T10:04:59  <mcstar> im perfectly fine with weechat

2012-01-05T10:07:28  <rwest> mleise: even if you just use the math concept in your program that solves it, your computation time can be cut to under a second
2012-01-05T10:07:48  <mleise> rwest: So combinatorics can solve the problem of interdependent decisions and give me the best decision among many that would usually create an enormous game tree?

2012-01-05T10:09:10  <rwest> mleise: they can be used to calculate the number of different moves and also probability of different events that are random
2012-01-05T10:09:13  <mleise> I know I can use combinatorics to solve part of the problem, like the probabilities that a player has a set of cards, but I have no idea how to extend that to an actual played game
2012-01-05T10:10:22  <mleise> rwest: Sure, number of moves. That helps me in allocating memory, but not knowing the next players' moves depending on my move
2012-01-05T10:10:23  <rwest> mleise: you would use the probability to assign weights to given moves based on probabilities of what other players have
2012-01-05T10:10:45  <mleise> rwest: sure
2012-01-05T10:10:55  <rwest> that's how a good poker ai works
2012-01-05T10:10:57  <mleise> I've got these numbers
2012-01-05T10:11:14  <rwest> for say texas holdem
2012-01-05T10:11:27  <rwest> based on what it knows, it has to calculate it's chance of winning
2012-01-05T10:11:33  <mleise> I take a look at my cards and use combinatorics to calculate the probabilities that other players can make any of the valid moves
2012-01-05T10:12:16  <mleise> but it is not like the game ends when I placed cards and the next player placed cards
2012-01-05T10:12:25  <rwest> mleise: then it is a min/max from there, but the deeper you go, the less accurate
2012-01-05T10:13:36  <mcstar> whats that supposed to mean?
2012-01-05T10:13:45  <mleise> Would I need a min/max? I mean, right now I cannot evaluate a hand to some floating point number, so I don't know if a certain move is good or bad by itself.
2012-01-05T10:14:01  <rwest> mleise: I don't know the game
2012-01-05T10:15:00  <mleise> It is the game I talked about yesterday. 32 cards (8 values, 4 duplicates)
2012-01-05T10:15:02  <rwest> mcstar: you don't know your opponents hands, you can get probabilities of what they have, but if you are wrong on any given move, subsequent moves you could simulate would be very wrong
2012-01-05T10:15:30  <mleise> One player begins and the next players try to place the same amount or more of a higher value.
2012-01-05T10:15:37  <mcstar> rwest: min/max simulates scenarios, it doesnt have probabilities
2012-01-05T10:15:55  <mleise> So a 7 is followed by 1 to 4 eights or higher cards
2012-01-05T10:16:23  <rwest> mcstar: that is the point, your scenarios generated are based on shaky data
2012-01-05T10:16:40  <rwest> in this case
2012-01-05T10:16:48  <mleise> The player who could last make a move starts a new 'stack'
2012-01-05T10:17:00  <mcstar> rwest: i dont agree, lets leave it there
2012-01-05T10:17:10  <mleise> It is ok to skip a turn
2012-01-05T10:17:36  <mleise> So you may be able to put cards on a stack, but want to save them for later.
2012-01-05T10:17:54  <rwest> mcstar: you are telling me I can't generate a set of data based on what will probably happen?
2012-01-05T10:17:55  <mleise> The one who is without cards first, wins.
2012-01-05T10:18:12  <mcstar> you are scoring possible futures
2012-01-05T10:18:24  <mcstar> evaluating whats best for you, and for your opponent
2012-01-05T10:18:37  <mcstar> at thsi point i dont see probabilities
2012-01-05T10:18:52  <mleise> Actually I want a four player game :)
2012-01-05T10:18:52  <rwest> mcstar: yes, but you do not know your opponents hands, you know what you have and what has been played
2012-01-05T10:19:06  <mleise> rwest: exactly
2012-01-05T10:19:34  <mleise> and you can calculate the probability that the remaining cards are spread one way or the other
2012-01-05T10:20:01  <rwest> mleise: that would have to be done via checking behavior I think
2012-01-05T10:20:12  <rwest> like say they play only a high card when the prev card is low
2012-01-05T10:20:24  <rwest> maybe it is because they do not have cards in between
2012-01-05T10:20:51  <mleise> maybe?
2012-01-05T10:21:04  <rwest> mleise: otherwise, you will probably be way off
2012-01-05T10:21:11  <rwest> for what opponents have
2012-01-05T10:21:16  <mcstar> rwest: ok, makes sense, but then i dont know how this probability scoring and min/max interacts
2012-01-05T10:21:27  <mcstar> do you computer averages for every node?
2012-01-05T10:21:29  <mcstar> -r
2012-01-05T10:21:29  <mleise> they must play a higher card or skip the round. that helps reduce the problem space
2012-01-05T10:22:01  <rwest> mleise: if they MUST, that helps
2012-01-05T10:22:04  <mleise> 2*eight can only be beaten by at least 2 nines or higher cards
2012-01-05T10:22:17  <mleise> well.. or they can skip
2012-01-05T10:23:21  <rwest> mcstar: it's more of a you calculate their most probable hand and do the tree with that assumption
2012-01-05T10:23:22  <mleise> but if player 1 puts cards on the table and everyone else skips, he is able to open a new stack, giving him the chance to get rid of some low cards, like sevens
2012-01-05T10:23:52  <rwest> mleise: I would try to use a strategy similar to what I would do playing it myself
2012-01-05T10:24:00  <rwest> lock people out of playing altogether
2012-01-05T10:24:13  <rwest> since I have played Asshole a lot
2012-01-05T10:24:18  <rwest> and this game is much like that
2012-01-05T10:24:19  <rwest> heh
2012-01-05T10:24:29  <mleise> rwest: That's what I'd like to do. But once I decide on one game tree node (i.e. one set of cards for a player) the probabilities for all other players must be recalculated
2012-01-05T10:25:02  <mleise> rwest: This game is our little family version of Asshole ;)
2012-01-05T10:25:30  <rwest> mleise: I think calculating the set of cards for a player really can't be done without using their previous moves to help you
2012-01-05T10:25:50  <rwest> and then of course, the AI would be able to be mislead if the player knows it's strategy
2012-01-05T10:26:21  <mleise> Imagine you would backtrack what a player has from looking at what he played
2012-01-05T10:26:35  <ahow984_> mcstar: rwest: would one of you mind telling me the answer to PE 25? I have it done but I just want to see how close my answer is (off by one error or something)
2012-01-05T10:26:52  <mleise> If it is 3 eights, you would look at all game trees and find out where 3 eights has the highest rank
2012-01-05T10:26:57  <rwest> say the card down is a 3 and they play a 10
2012-01-05T10:27:10  <mcstar> 283?
2012-01-05T10:27:12  <rwest> I say assume they have no card (except doubles) between 3 and 10
2012-01-05T10:27:18  <mcstar> or something similar
2012-01-05T10:27:22  <mcstar> 289?
2012-01-05T10:27:26  <mcstar> 298?
2012-01-05T10:27:29  <mcstar> 293?
2012-01-05T10:27:31  <rwest> ended in a 7
2012-01-05T10:27:35  <rwest> I remember that
2012-01-05T10:27:53  <mleise> rwest: :( I feared it would come down to miming a human
2012-01-05T10:27:56  <ahow984_> kk, something around there
2012-01-05T10:27:58  <ahow984_> ty
2012-01-05T10:28:16  <mcstar> ah
2012-01-05T10:28:21  <mcstar> 25th?
2012-01-05T10:28:23  <ahow984_> did it take long to run?
2012-01-05T10:28:32  <rwest> mine is fast
2012-01-05T10:28:39  <mcstar> 4782
2012-01-05T10:28:41  <rwest> I use my own bignum library though
2012-01-05T10:28:42  <mcstar> lol, i was off
2012-01-05T10:28:51  <rwest> mcstar: or it had a 7
2012-01-05T10:28:52  <rwest> lol
2012-01-05T10:28:53  <ahow984_> hmm, I think mine goes into an infinite loop :/
2012-01-05T10:29:08  <ahow984_> or else its desperately slow lol
2012-01-05T10:29:11  <rwest> oh I can see the answer when I click the problem
2012-01-05T10:29:42  <ahow984_> mcstar: I understand the log(phi^n/sqrt(5)) now :)
2012-01-05T10:30:10  <mcstar> (phi^n-psi^n)
2012-01-05T10:30:30  <mcstar> ah yes
2012-01-05T10:30:38  <mcstar> i estimated it near 5000
2012-01-05T10:30:42  <mcstar> i remember now :)
2012-01-05T10:30:48  <ahow984_> lol wtf is psi? :P
2012-01-05T10:30:55  <ahow984_> tangential curve? :/
2012-01-05T10:31:02  <mcstar> ahow984_: why did you say you understood?
2012-01-05T10:31:04  <rwest> I already had a program that would print out a fib number with such digits
2012-01-05T10:31:34  <ahow984_> that formula up there that I said finds the number of digits in fib(n)
2012-01-05T10:32:15  <mcstar> approximately its: log_10((phi^n-psi^n)/sqrt(5))
2012-01-05T10:32:30  <mcstar> where phi=(1+sqrt(5))/2
2012-01-05T10:32:35  <mcstar> where psi=(1-sqrt(5))/2
2012-01-05T10:32:40  <mcstar> or something VERY similar
2012-01-05T10:32:41  <ahow984_> ah, ok
2012-01-05T10:32:43  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-05T10:32:50  <ahow984_> http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibFormula.html#fiblong
2012-01-05T10:33:06  <ahow984_> it said that it was so close that you didn't need the psi part :P
2012-01-05T10:33:26  <mcstar> cold be true
2012-01-05T10:33:29  <mcstar> i didnt bother
2012-01-05T10:33:54  <mcstar> btw i pasted the code here didnt i?
2012-01-05T10:34:02  <ahow984_> yup
2012-01-05T10:34:08  <mcstar> ah ok
2012-01-05T10:34:18  <ahow984_> hmm :/
2012-01-05T10:34:24  <ahow984_> this is weird that it doesn't work
2012-01-05T10:35:48  <ahow984_> http://codepad.org/OYyCK3Ck
2012-01-05T10:36:26  <mcstar> :S
2012-01-05T10:36:33  <mcstar> i told you its an approximate formula
2012-01-05T10:36:42  <ahow984_> yes
2012-01-05T10:36:47  <mcstar> it has the right "tendency" but it isnt correct
2012-01-05T10:37:01  <ahow984_> so it should give me a someway correct answer
2012-01-05T10:37:16  <ahow984_> this runs past 300000 with no answer....
2012-01-05T10:37:46  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-05T10:38:06  <mcstar> it gets floating point exceptions most probably
2012-01-05T10:38:15  <ahow984_> but I cast it?
2012-01-05T10:38:21  <mcstar> i could only get n=1200 in python
2012-01-05T10:38:50  <mcstar> pow(phi, i)
2012-01-05T10:38:58  <mcstar> i must be less than ~1200
2012-01-05T10:39:17  <ahow984_> does it fail after that?
2012-01-05T10:39:22  <mcstar> ofc
2012-01-05T10:39:48  <mcstar> i mean your cmputation will fail
2012-01-05T10:39:59  <mcstar> you are passing nans back and forth
2012-01-05T10:40:16  <ahow984_> sorry what? I'm not good at math
2012-01-05T10:40:27  <mcstar> NotaNumber
2012-01-05T10:40:33  <mcstar> floating point error code
2012-01-05T10:40:51  <ahow984_> why would it fail after 1200?
2012-01-05T10:41:38  <rwest> 1.6^1200
2012-01-05T10:41:42  <mcstar> because you run out of precision
2012-01-05T10:42:01  <mcstar> sorry
2012-01-05T10:42:04  <mcstar> exponent
2012-01-05T10:42:16  <mcstar> precision just gets truncated
2012-01-05T10:42:35  <ahow984_> ok
2012-01-05T10:42:41  <ahow984_> still shouldn't affect the answer
2012-01-05T10:43:02  <mcstar> double can represent < 10^308 absolute valued numebers
2012-01-05T10:43:11  <mcstar> ?
2012-01-05T10:43:47  <ahow984_> :( ok
2012-01-05T10:43:51  <mcstar> the cast to (int) becomes meaningless
2012-01-05T10:44:00  <mcstar> so does the < 1000
2012-01-05T10:44:35  <mcstar> ah, ofc log fails too
2012-01-05T10:44:42  <mcstar> its a clusterfuck, doesnt need more describing
2012-01-05T10:44:58  <ahow984_> yeah, ok

2012-01-05T12:01:38  <rwest> does it mean it will take blocks?

2012-01-05T12:02:22  <ahow984_> should be clarified though

2012-01-05T12:05:40  <ahow984_> yes
2012-01-05T12:05:41  <rwest> its like 10 lines heh\
2012-01-05T12:05:47  <ahow984_> but you only go in straight lines :P
2012-01-05T12:07:23  <rwest> yes, that is why it is more complicated than the any direction one

2012-01-05T12:32:41  <ahow984_> antimatroid: I find it hard to believe that you're a bad programmer :P
2012-01-05T12:32:47  <ahow984_> rwest: really?
2012-01-05T12:32:51  <ahow984_> I'm trying now too
2012-01-05T12:32:54  <rwest> oh nvm
2012-01-05T12:32:58  <ahow984_> :P

2012-01-05T12:33:10  <rwest> lol
2012-01-05T12:33:24  <ahow984_> rwest: if you could do it for 18, why not 20?
2012-01-05T12:33:43  <rwest> ahow984_: it's a mathematical patern
2012-01-05T12:33:45  <rwest> pattern
2012-01-05T12:33:54  <rwest> for 1 2 3 6 18
2012-01-05T12:33:58  <rwest> err
2012-01-05T12:34:11  <ahow984_> its like a binary tree, no?
2012-01-05T12:34:11  <rwest> maybe one sec

2012-01-05T12:34:30  <antimatroid> do you want some of the easier later problems?
2012-01-05T12:34:40  <antimatroid> i can give you some of the ones i've solved which had neatish little tricks
2012-01-05T12:34:48  <ahow984_> antimatroid: :)
2012-01-05T12:35:07  <ahow984_> I'd like to try them first before I hear a hint though :P
2012-01-05T12:35:19  <antimatroid> 81-83 is more pathfinding
2012-01-05T12:35:43  <antimatroid> 85 is really easy once you see the trick
2012-01-05T12:36:26  <ahow984_> :( rwest it's not a binary tree really :(
2012-01-05T12:37:10  <ahow984_> :) I did 81 before pretty much
2012-01-05T12:37:17  <antimatroid> i'm not sure which of the others i just brute forced or not
2012-01-05T12:37:30  <antimatroid> 205 is the highest numbered one i have solved, but i brute forced that with a tree
2012-01-05T12:37:43  <ahow984_> except it could go diagonally up or down or straight right as long as it went right in some way shape or form
2012-01-05T12:38:09  <antimatroid> i never did 83, i might do that now to make sure i am in fact smarter with path finding
2012-01-05T12:38:18  <antimatroid> it seems pretty straight forward though
2012-01-05T12:38:36  <antimatroid> interestingly, i have never been able to get 12 out
2012-01-05T12:38:42  <antimatroid> i have only ever tried with c++
2012-01-05T12:38:49  <rwest> ahow984_: it's a binary tree minus last node on the right
2012-01-05T12:40:39  <rwest> say it's 2 wide
2012-01-05T12:40:50  <rwest> once you go right twice, you have no more splits
2012-01-05T12:41:29  <ahow984_> yes
2012-01-05T12:42:54  <McLeopold> @later tell amstan I would suggest turning off the tron website until the database can be fixed.  It doesn't have indexes and keeps causing deadlocks.
2012-01-05T12:42:55  <contestbot> McLeopold: Yep.
2012-01-05T12:48:31  <rwest> ahow984_: recursive answer is 8 lines
2012-01-05T12:48:40  <rwest> and slow as balls lol

2012-01-05T12:48:52  <ahow984_> how long?
2012-01-05T12:49:22  <rwest> still going, I checked it against 1 2 and 3 width squares first
2012-01-05T12:49:30  <McLeopold> @later tell amstan I've redirected tron.aichallenge.org to an empty directory to prevent the mysql queries from running.  At some point, we need to add indexes to that database to prevent the issues.
2012-01-05T12:49:30  <contestbot> McLeopold: I think that worked...
2012-01-05T12:49:40  <ahow984_> rwest: heh
2012-01-05T12:49:56  <rwest> I hope php doesn't have a stack limit lol
2012-01-05T12:49:59  <ahow984_> I'm not that good with recursion yet so I need to do more thinking
2012-01-05T12:50:05  <ahow984_> php?!? -_-
2012-01-05T12:50:11  <rwest> I love php hah
2012-01-05T12:50:21  <rwest> I use more languages on a daily basis than most
2012-01-05T12:50:31  <ahow984_> yeah, you must
2012-01-05T12:51:18  <rwest> still going lol
2012-01-05T12:51:25  <rwest> I should just start work on the next problem
2012-01-05T12:51:58  <ahow984_> what was the answer for 3?
2012-01-05T12:54:37  <rwest> 20
2012-01-05T12:55:14  <rwest> php running at 100% cpu

2012-01-05T13:24:41  <rwest> oh it's still calculating too hah
2012-01-05T13:24:47  <rwest> 17 took like 30s
2012-01-05T13:25:01  <rwest> and before that it was < 2s
2012-01-05T13:25:04  <ahow984_> I think running it for half the tree and *'ing by 2 should work
2012-01-05T13:25:07  <rwest> so it's growing fast

2012-01-05T13:31:16  <antimatroid> it's 5:30am though so that might have to do for the moment
2012-01-05T13:31:21  <thestinger> yeah, I did it when I learned to program around a year and a half ago
2012-01-05T13:31:28  <thestinger> haven't gone there since then

2012-01-05T13:32:27  <ahow984_> I'm not in the USA, I just say high school because people understand that
2012-01-05T13:32:44  <antimatroid> dunno, 13-16 or something like that
2012-01-05T13:32:49  <ahow984_> yeah, 16

2012-01-05T13:34:24  <antimatroid> be very very smart

2012-01-05T13:34:42  <ahow984_> yes, he must be ridiculously smart
2012-01-05T13:35:04  <antimatroid> he's hoping to trot off to oxford in september, so that should say something :P
2012-01-05T13:35:10  <ahow984_> haha
2012-01-05T13:35:14  <ahow984_> posh boy ;)
2012-01-05T13:35:20  <antimatroid> that depends on whether he gets government scholarships or not though
2012-01-05T13:35:25  <ahow984_> still in the commonwealth though :P
2012-01-05T13:35:29  <antimatroid> nah, at the postgrad level you get funded

2012-01-05T13:36:59  <mcstar> im not walking the damn graph

2012-01-05T13:37:26  <ahow984_> I was certain you could do it with math, but I still can't find out how >_<
2012-01-05T13:37:28  <thestinger> that one is actually easier than you probably think it is
2012-01-05T13:37:31  <thestinger> you can do it on paper
2012-01-05T13:37:40  <ahow984_> I tried :(
2012-01-05T13:37:44  <thestinger> just do a few tiny ones (1x1, 2x2, 3x3) and you'll get it
2012-01-05T13:38:34  <mcstar> theres no fun in doing it on paper
2012-01-05T13:38:39  <antimatroid> do it on paper?
2012-01-05T13:38:44  <antimatroid> the answer is quite large
2012-01-05T13:38:49  <antimatroid> it is a counting problem though
2012-01-05T13:38:51  <mcstar> but if you want to do it in a functinal way, its challenging
2012-01-05T13:39:07  <mcstar> (no mutable updates)
2012-01-05T13:39:26  <mcstar> let me sort this out
2012-01-05T13:39:57  <mcstar> i didnt even test it for 2x2
2012-01-05T13:39:59  <mcstar> lol
2012-01-05T13:40:08  <mcstar> just wrote it, typechecker said ok, so i tried it
2012-01-05T13:40:14  <thestinger> lol, I wonder which one I should start with
2012-01-05T13:40:18  <thestinger> I skipped some that I was too lazy to do
2012-01-05T13:41:09  <ahow984_> thestinger: I've got some data now
2012-01-05T13:41:19  <ahow984_> I'll try to find a relationship ;)
2012-01-05T13:41:25  <ahow984_> bbiab lol
2012-01-05T13:42:01  <mcstar> hah
2012-01-05T13:42:07  <mcstar> gives 4 for 2x2
2012-01-05T13:42:22  <mcstar> man, i need a relationship too
2012-01-05T13:42:42  <thestinger> my solution is 1 function call, something I had coded before :P
2012-01-05T13:43:30  <thestinger> ugh.. I don't want to parse text
2012-01-05T13:43:34  <thestinger> I'll just use a vim macro
2012-01-05T13:43:43  <antimatroid> yeah i hate having to strip commas
2012-01-05T13:44:15  <thestinger> or add them :P
2012-01-05T13:44:43  <antimatroid> well when you have like "123,3453,3445" what's the easiest way to read that into a vector of ints in c++?
2012-01-05T13:45:45  <thestinger> std::vector<int> v = {123,3453,3445};
2012-01-05T13:45:51  <thestinger> use C++11, don't torture yourself
2012-01-05T13:46:06  <antimatroid> the text is in an input file stream
2012-01-05T13:46:25  <thestinger> well
2012-01-05T13:46:35  <thestinger> in python I'd just .split(",")
2012-01-05T13:46:42  <thestinger> and map(int, whatever)
2012-01-05T13:46:56  <antimatroid> i guess write split then
2012-01-05T13:47:04  <antimatroid> i wrote join for my game theory library
2012-01-05T13:47:29  <thestinger> boost::split
2012-01-05T13:47:42  <antimatroid> bah c++ :(
2012-01-05T13:47:50  <antimatroid> i don't like having to install extra crap
2012-01-05T13:48:00  <thestinger> boost is header only though
2012-01-05T13:48:02  <thestinger> might as well
2012-01-05T13:48:18  <rwest> ahow984_: 64 bit integer overflowed
2012-01-05T13:48:51  <thestinger> ugh, I forgot I had to fix these numbers starting with 0
2012-01-05T13:49:22  <rwest> time for a 3rd rewrite
2012-01-05T13:49:24  <rwest> now tcl
2012-01-05T13:50:10  <thestinger> yay for regex

2012-01-05T13:51:52  <thestinger> amstan: it sucks, use bpython
2012-01-05T13:51:56  <amstan> it's meant as a general purpose shell apparently
2012-01-05T13:52:01  <amstan> bpython?
2012-01-05T13:52:04  <thestinger> ipython is only good if you're actually using scipy/matplotlib
2012-01-05T13:52:21  <thestinger> amstan: http://bpython-interpreter.org/
2012-01-05T13:52:38  <Anilm3> Hi
2012-01-05T13:52:48  <thestinger> bpython (py3) and bpython2 are in my distro's repos anyway
2012-01-05T13:52:58  <amstan> oh man, apt-get is so painfully slow
2012-01-05T13:53:02  <thestinger> amstan: it's much nicer than ipython, and not super bloated/buggy
2012-01-05T13:53:15  <amstan> thestinger: i can't do ls
2012-01-05T13:53:42  <thestinger> well, ipython adds aliases by default
2012-01-05T13:53:51  <thestinger> for all the commands it finds in PATH
2012-01-05T13:53:55  <amstan> ok, so how do i use this as a shell
2012-01-05T13:53:57  <thestinger> bpython is for python devel
2012-01-05T13:53:59  <thestinger> oh
2012-01-05T13:54:04  <thestinger> didn't realize you wanted that :P
2012-01-05T13:54:06  <thestinger> just use zsh
2012-01-05T13:54:11  <amstan> yeah, that's what intrigued me
2012-01-05T13:54:15  <thestinger> ipython is meh as a shell
2012-01-05T13:54:22  <thestinger> they just add aliases by default
2012-01-05T13:54:27  <amstan> i can do stuff like this: alex=!sudo apt-get something
2012-01-05T13:54:37  <amstan> and alex will contain a list of lines that apt-get outputed on stdout
2012-01-05T13:54:46  <thestinger> yeah, but you could just make a p() function
2012-01-05T13:55:03  <thestinger> and alex=p("grep blabla . -R")
2012-01-05T13:55:11  <ahow984_> rwest: 64-bit int or 64-bit long?
2012-01-05T13:55:12  <thestinger> just a bit of syntactic sugar
2012-01-05T13:55:13  <Anilm3> what's wrong with good old bash?
2012-01-05T13:55:19  <thestinger> Anilm3: bash sucks
2012-01-05T13:55:23  <thestinger> crappy autocompletion
2012-01-05T13:55:24  <Anilm3> :(
2012-01-05T13:55:29  <amstan> idk, i'm experimenting with different shells
2012-01-05T13:55:36  <thestinger> zsh is awesome, once you configure it
2012-01-05T13:55:38  <ahow984_> I'm hoping unsigned long long will hold it, but if it's anything near what mcstar pasted, I'm screwed
2012-01-05T13:55:45  <amstan> i switched to zsh for now, but in some cases autocomplete fails where in bash it would have worked
2012-01-05T13:55:56  <thestinger> amstan: you have to configure it :)
2012-01-05T13:56:04  <thestinger> also, what distro do you use?
2012-01-05T13:56:05  <amstan> for ex: sudo chsh -s /bin/<tab> doesn't work
2012-01-05T13:56:09  <amstan> ubuntu and arch
2012-01-05T13:56:17  <amstan> on either...
2012-01-05T13:56:28  <thestinger> do you have the sudo alias?
2012-01-05T13:56:31  <thestinger> for completion with sudo
2012-01-05T13:56:36  <amstan> yes
2012-01-05T13:56:51  <Anilm3>  I have to learn python...
2012-01-05T13:56:59  <amstan> killall autocomplete doesn't work either
2012-01-05T13:56:59  <rwest> ahow984_: unsigned long only holding an integer
2012-01-05T13:57:02  <ahow984_> Anilm3: me too
2012-01-05T13:57:03  <thestinger> amstan: sec
2012-01-05T13:57:17  <ahow984_> rwest: ... what? that makes no sense
2012-01-05T13:57:56  <ahow984_> thestinger: I'm still struggling to find the math solution :P
2012-01-05T13:58:44  <thestinger> ahow984_: http://sprunge.us/QHZK
2012-01-05T13:58:47  <thestinger> oops
2012-01-05T13:58:49  <thestinger> amstan: http://sprunge.us/QHZK
2012-01-05T13:59:16  <thestinger> the two processes lines get you completion for pkill, kill, etc.
2012-01-05T13:59:37  <amstan> how does bash handle all of those completes?
2012-01-05T13:59:52  <amstan> i noticed there's a bash-completion.d in my /etc
2012-01-05T13:59:57  <amstan> can't zsh use that?
2012-01-05T14:00:05  <thestinger> yes, it has compatibility with that
2012-01-05T14:00:08  <thestinger> but you don't need it
2012-01-05T14:00:17  <thestinger> it will mostly make things worse
2012-01-05T14:00:24  <amstan> so why doesn't it use that already? there might be things in there i missed
2012-01-05T14:00:48  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/QHZK <- just try that in zshrc
2012-01-05T14:00:56  <thestinger> I think the process completion needs to be turned on like that
2012-01-05T14:01:38  <thestinger> some packages come with their own completion functions
2012-01-05T14:01:43  <thestinger> like pacman
2012-01-05T14:01:56  <thestinger> pacman has files for both zsh and bash (the zsh one completes more)
2012-01-05T14:02:37  <thestinger> anyway, lots are missing zsh completion functions
2012-01-05T14:03:03  <amstan> yeah, this is better

2012-01-05T14:03:10  <amstan> than what i had before
2012-01-05T14:03:20  <thestinger> I like the list then menu complete
2012-01-05T14:03:33  <thestinger> list when ambiguous, and tab/shift-tab to cycle forwards/backwards
2012-01-05T14:03:36  <thestinger> and you can use arrows
2012-01-05T14:03:40  <amstan> but it would be nice to use the bash ones for commands i'm missing
2012-01-05T14:04:03  <thestinger> if [[ -n $terminfo[kcbt] ]]; then
2012-01-05T14:04:05  <thestinger>     bindkey          "$terminfo[kcbt]"  reverse-menu-complete
2012-01-05T14:04:07  <thestinger> fi
2012-01-05T14:04:09  <thestinger> you might need that for shift-tab
2012-01-05T14:04:21  <thestinger> anyway I forget how to fall back to bash/ksh completion
2012-01-05T14:04:56  <thestinger> oh, found it
2012-01-05T14:05:01  <thestinger> _bash_completions
2012-01-05T14:05:02  <amstan> once i start that menu for autocompletion, how can i cancel it?
2012-01-05T14:05:21  <amstan> as in.. delete everything that was autocompleted so far
2012-01-05T14:05:52  <thestinger> I've changed all my bindings so... sec
2012-01-05T14:06:00  <Anilm3> amstan: I heard rumors about an asteroids game for the next challenge
2012-01-05T14:06:04  <Anilm3> how serious is it?
2012-01-05T14:06:15  <thestinger> amstan: ctrl-C should work
2012-01-05T14:06:22  <pairofdice> It will eat your babies, Anilm3
2012-01-05T14:06:28  <amstan> Anilm3: i'm just playing with pyqt, see repo for more details
2012-01-05T14:06:39  <amstan> Anilm3: it could be anything though
2012-01-05T14:07:09  <amstan> thestinger: hmm, that works, thanks
2012-01-05T14:07:21  <amstan> thestinger: one more thing: do you use git prompt?
2012-01-05T14:07:32  <thestinger> nope, my prompt is pretty basic
2012-01-05T14:07:37  <amstan> darn
2012-01-05T14:07:42  <thestinger> strcat@arch i ~/projects %
2012-01-05T14:07:55  <thestinger> i turns to c when I'm in command mode
2012-01-05T14:07:58  <thestinger> that's it
2012-01-05T14:08:01  <amstan> there's this funky thing i'm getting for a repo in an sshfs mount
2012-01-05T14:08:18  <amstan> i might try r/zsh to fix it
2012-01-05T14:08:23  <ahow984_> rwest: you got it yet? :P
2012-01-05T14:09:11  <amstan> thestinger: right.. how do i use that _bash_completions thing?
2012-01-05T14:09:39  <thestinger> trying to figure that out :P
2012-01-05T14:09:53  <amstan> it already autocompletes for my apt-get somehow
2012-01-05T14:09:57  <amstan> so it might already work
2012-01-05T14:10:02  <thestinger> that probably comes with zsh
2012-01-05T14:10:04  <amstan> same with git
2012-01-05T14:10:19  <thestinger> /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion
2012-01-05T14:10:23  <Anilm3> amstan: interesting
2012-01-05T14:10:26  <thestinger> that's where all the completion files are
2012-01-05T14:10:39  <thestinger> and there's /usr/share/zsh/site-functions for stuff like pacman that doesn't ship with zsh
2012-01-05T14:11:08  <amstan> thestinger: interesting
2012-01-05T14:11:10  <thestinger> anyway, there's no _chsh
2012-01-05T14:11:16  <amstan> well.. it seems fine for now
2012-01-05T14:11:31  <amstan> i don't think i'm missing anything on the completion front now
2012-01-05T14:12:13  <thestinger> amstan: http://sprunge.us/QKfP
2012-01-05T14:12:16  <amstan> another weird thing i'm having is that the history command only outputs 16 lines
2012-01-05T14:12:17  <thestinger> the man page says you can add that
2012-01-05T14:12:31  <thestinger> so I guess ctrl-X will do bash completion
2012-01-05T14:12:40  <thestinger> not sure what \e is...
2012-01-05T14:12:50  <amstan> tab?
2012-01-05T14:13:04  <thestinger> I think tab is ^I
2012-01-05T14:13:16  <thestinger> btw, ctrl-H is the same as backspace almost everywhere
2012-01-05T14:13:19  <thestinger> computers are weird :)
2012-01-05T14:14:10  <thestinger> amstan: oh, and it says to add that loop after compinit
2012-01-05T14:14:21  <thestinger> 'man zshall' has everything but... it's huge
2012-01-05T14:14:33  <amstan> that's fine, i don't think i want another key combo for bash completion
2012-01-05T14:14:41  <amstan> i'll just use what zsh has
2012-01-05T14:14:48  <thestinger> yeah, it mostly has everyone
2012-01-05T14:14:55  <thestinger> the version on ubuntu is probably a bit older
2012-01-05T14:15:09  <thestinger> and they add new completion functions (and fix them) frequently
2012-01-05T14:15:11  <amstan> 4.3.11
2012-01-05T14:15:34  <thestinger> Arch has 4.3.15
2012-01-05T14:15:55  <thestinger> http://zsh.sourceforge.net/News/
2012-01-05T14:16:06  <thestinger> so yeah, probably some broken stuff for completion on your Ubuntu install
2012-01-05T14:16:15  <amstan> any idea why i only get the last 16 commands outputted by `history`? https://github.com/amstan/configs/blob/master/.zshrc#L54
2012-01-05T14:17:08  <thestinger> amstan: I think that's just how history works by default
2012-01-05T14:17:11  <thestinger> it works like tail
2012-01-05T14:17:14  <thestinger> history -50
2012-01-05T14:17:17  <amstan> darn
2012-01-05T14:17:25  <thestinger> probably a way to set the default
2012-01-05T14:17:28  <amstan> i do history|grep something a lot of the time
2012-01-05T14:17:40  <thestinger> are you mostly looking for what a command starts with?
2012-01-05T14:17:48  <amstan> not necessarly
2012-01-05T14:17:57  <amstan> any kind of substring searches
2012-01-05T14:18:07  <amstan> i know i can use ! for startswith
2012-01-05T14:18:54  <thestinger> well, I have up/down bound to history search stuff
2012-01-05T14:19:06  <thestinger> so if I've typed something, they search for commands starting with that string
2012-01-05T14:19:21  <thestinger> and then I use the actual search to look for something

2012-01-05T14:26:43  <mcstar> im not sure how clear that is from the code
2012-01-05T14:27:21  <thestinger> I usually start with brute force, and it works most of the time

2012-01-05T14:27:22  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan_
2012-01-05T14:27:28  <thestinger> but then I want to figure out how to do it "properly"
2012-01-05T14:27:46  <amstan_> thestinger: i'm very happy with arch, everything is faster: booting, pacman, wireless
2012-01-05T14:27:48  <mcstar> i consider mine somewhere inbetween
2012-01-05T14:28:00  <mcstar> and it is useful, when the graph isnt this nice
2012-01-05T14:28:12  <mcstar> amstan_: WELCOME
2012-01-05T14:28:12  <thestinger> amstan_: rolling release is really nice too
2012-01-05T14:28:22  <amstan_> thestinger: yes
2012-01-05T14:28:32  <amstan_> i'm switching my desktop and my server soon
2012-01-05T14:28:36  <mcstar> yay
2012-01-05T14:28:43  <amstan_> Anilm3: so.. asteroids...
2012-01-05T14:28:56  <mcstar> i have a feeling, everyone will convert for 3000
2012-01-05T14:29:05  <thestinger> amstan_: I also find it very stable compared to ubuntu/debian, now that I've been using it for a long time
2012-01-05T14:29:06  <amstan_> what do people think: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/amstan-asteroids
2012-01-05T14:29:30  <amstan_> even amarok is faster somehow...
2012-01-05T14:29:34  <thestinger> dpkg tries to do so much magic with post-install stuff, like choosing alternate packages to provide stuff
2012-01-05T14:29:40  <amstan_> the kubuntu maintainers are doing something wrong
2012-01-05T14:29:51  <thestinger> amstan_: well, KDE is supposed to be really good on Arch (I don't use it though)
2012-01-05T14:29:59  <mcstar> thestinger: why?
2012-01-05T14:30:02  <amstan_> thestinger: i can attest to that
2012-01-05T14:30:06  <thestinger> they don't patch everything
2012-01-05T14:30:13  <mcstar> it is vanilla
2012-01-05T14:30:17  <mcstar> afaik
2012-01-05T14:30:18  <thestinger> if something is broken they might write a patch, but the Arch policy is to submit that all upstream
2012-01-05T14:30:23  <thestinger> if they reject a patch, it won't be used
2012-01-05T14:30:32  <thestinger> if they ignore the bug report, it might be used if it actually fixes something
2012-01-05T14:30:40  <amstan_> mcstar: it's vanilla and fast, somehow in kubuntu everything gets broken somehow
2012-01-05T14:30:41  <thestinger> debian has like 60 patches applied to each thing
2012-01-05T14:30:56  <thestinger> because they're trying to keep using some ancient version and backport bug fixes and even features
2012-01-05T14:31:02  <amstan_> like every update kubuntu just refuses to go to sleep from the kde stuff, i have to do pm-suspend from sudo
2012-01-05T14:31:25  <mcstar> broken dbus? or policykit?
2012-01-05T14:31:37  <amstan_> maybe, no idea
2012-01-05T14:31:45  <thestinger> you can actually suspend with pm-utils
2012-01-05T14:31:50  <thestinger> echo mem > /sys/power/state
2012-01-05T14:31:59  <mcstar> i do sudo init 0 every night
2012-01-05T14:32:15  <amstan_> thestinger: yes, but i want to use kshutdown for a timed sleep when i'm watching movies
2012-01-05T14:32:23  <thestinger> amstan_: ah
2012-01-05T14:32:26  <amstan_> and 30% of the time i find my computer running in the morning
2012-01-05T14:33:33  <mcstar> cant xbmc shut it down?
2012-01-05T14:33:39  <amstan_> i use vlc
2012-01-05T14:33:45  <amstan_> anyway.. asteroids: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/amstan-asteroids
2012-01-05T14:33:48  <amstan_> has anyone tried it?
2012-01-05T14:33:51  <mcstar> once i was watching movies from bed, with remote control
2012-01-05T14:34:01  <mcstar> amstan_: try xbmc, really nice
2012-01-05T14:34:08  <mcstar> should be even nicer by now
2012-01-05T14:34:15  <amstan_> i don't like the fact that it tries to index all my media
2012-01-05T14:34:16  <mcstar> amstan_: i did clone it yesterday
2012-01-05T14:34:35  <mcstar> actually, i downloaded a zip
2012-01-05T14:34:44  <mcstar> how can a clone a branch with git?
2012-01-05T14:35:14  <g0llum> amstan_, tried it. setRotation was not found, qt version problem i guess.
2012-01-05T14:35:17  <thestinger> amstan_: try smplayer
2012-01-05T14:35:23  <amstan_> g0llum: maybe
2012-01-05T14:35:25  <thestinger> it's mplayer with a nice Qt frontend
2012-01-05T14:35:30  <thestinger> nicer than vlc
2012-01-05T14:35:35  <amstan_> mcstar: clone normally then git checkout branchname
2012-01-05T14:35:53  <mcstar> aham
2012-01-05T14:36:01  <mcstar> makes sense
2012-01-05T14:36:06  <amstan_> thestinger: i can't throw everything at it though, i sometimes use vlc with youtube too
2012-01-05T14:36:07  <mcstar> im still bad with git though
2012-01-05T14:36:28  <amstan_> seems like aerique has made a lot more progress: https://github.com/aerique/aichallenge/tree/asteroids/asteroids#readme
2012-01-05T14:36:45  <thestinger> amstan_: youtube-viewer :)
2012-01-05T14:36:49  <amstan_> aerique: you should probably get commit access to the main repo already
2012-01-05T14:36:51  <amstan_> thestinger: minitube
2012-01-05T14:36:58  <mcstar> flash keeps crashing for me
2012-01-05T14:37:09  <thestinger> on Arch?
2012-01-05T14:37:11  <thestinger> nvidia driver?
2012-01-05T14:37:12  <mcstar> yep
2012-01-05T14:37:22  <mcstar> nouveau/nvidia doesnt matter
2012-01-05T14:37:23  <amstan_> flash is flash, lol
2012-01-05T14:37:35  <thestinger> mcstar: flashplugin from [extra], right?
2012-01-05T14:37:40  <thestinger> you might have to turn off hardware accel
2012-01-05T14:37:59  <thestinger> /etc/adobe/mms.cfg iirc
2012-01-05T14:38:10  <thestinger> I think it's borked on x86_64
2012-01-05T14:38:12  <mcstar> doesnt matter
2012-01-05T14:38:17  <mcstar> my card doesnt support it
2012-01-05T14:38:22  <mcstar> 7050
2012-01-05T14:38:23  <thestinger> ah
2012-01-05T14:38:29  <mcstar> integrated
2012-01-05T14:38:37  <mcstar> my 9400 just died
2012-01-05T14:38:55  <thestinger> my HD5870 just died... luckily it was on warranty
2012-01-05T14:39:04  <thestinger> now I have to wait forever for them to send a new one
2012-01-05T14:39:18  <mcstar> why amd?
2012-01-05T14:39:42  <thestinger> the nvidia cards were crap at the time I bought it
2012-01-05T14:39:47  <thestinger> 4xx had just come out, iirc
2012-01-05T14:39:49  <thestinger> and it was awful
2012-01-05T14:40:17  <thestinger> anyway, using a crappy old geforce 9300GE atm until I get it back
2012-01-05T14:40:25  <mcstar> i had bad experience with catalyst, on linux, so im staying away from it
2012-01-05T14:40:43  <mcstar> (unfounded by now, probably)
2012-01-05T14:40:45  <thestinger> I use the open-source driver on linux
2012-01-05T14:40:51  <amstan_> aerique: how can i run a game?
2012-01-05T14:41:08  <thestinger> mcstar: I only really use the card when I occasionally boot into windows to do gaming (which is rare)
2012-01-05T14:41:11  <mcstar> thestinger: anyway, do you proceed with haskell?
2012-01-05T14:41:42  <mcstar> (do you keep learning it, or you know enoguh....)
2012-01-05T14:41:50  <thestinger> I still need to learn more
2012-01-05T14:41:55  <thestinger> lots to learn
2012-01-05T14:42:06  <thestinger> haven't really used it for a while though
2012-01-05T14:42:14  <thestinger> I'm just lazy and use python for everything

2012-01-05T14:43:40  <thestinger> 18, it's easy
2012-01-05T14:43:40  <mcstar> whats the next problem btw?
2012-01-05T14:43:44  <mcstar> ok
2012-01-05T14:43:45  <McLeopold> amstan_: can you take the tron database out of readonly mode?
2012-01-05T14:43:47  <thestinger> but I think my vim macro screwed up
2012-01-05T14:44:25  <thestinger> anyway, I didn't feel like making a proper data structure so I just made a function to find the sum of a path, and I'll just call it for each possible path (assigned ints to them basically)
2012-01-05T14:44:57  <thestinger> Sorry, but the answer you gave appears to be incorrect.
2012-01-05T14:44:59  <thestinger> :(
2012-01-05T14:46:06  <thestinger> aw crap, I screwed up division somehow
2012-01-05T14:46:08  <pairofdice> Oh, that one. You're doing it wrong ;)
2012-01-05T14:46:16  <thestinger> I should have done it the proper way :P

2012-01-05T14:47:31  <thestinger> oh wow, I'm an idiot

2012-01-05T14:48:14  <McLeopold> amstan: where is this server?  is it your own?  how much memory? how much disk space?
2012-01-05T14:48:28  <amstan> McLeopold: janzert set it up
2012-01-05T14:48:33  <McLeopold> where is it?
2012-01-05T14:48:38  <amstan> not sure
2012-01-05T14:48:52  <amstan> till now we didn't have problems serving those websites, not sure what's going on
2012-01-05T14:49:03  <mcstar> seems easy enough...
2012-01-05T14:49:10  <thestinger> anyway, 169ms in python3
2012-01-05T14:49:12  <McLeopold> I think crawlers are finally finding tron
2012-01-05T14:49:27  <pairofdice> thestinger: did you just sum them up from the bottom
2012-01-05T14:49:36  <thestinger> top...
2012-01-05T14:49:43  <pairofdice> Well, you can do that too
2012-01-05T14:49:50  <pairofdice> Not much different
2012-01-05T14:50:18  <thestinger> yeah, it's just a few lines of code
2012-01-05T14:50:58  <thestinger> most of the work was done by the vim macro to turn their crappy triangle into a tuple of tuples
2012-01-05T14:51:47  <McLeopold> thestinger: you might consider reading from a file instead of manipulating in vim
2012-01-05T14:51:55  <mcstar> thestinger: does it scale well?
2012-01-05T14:52:00  <thestinger> mcstar: not sure
2012-01-05T14:52:07  <thestinger> I basically just have a function that turns an int into a path
2012-01-05T14:52:09  <McLeopold> then you can start to just copy and paste euler variables into files and read them in
2012-01-05T14:52:10  <thestinger> so I call it for each path
2012-01-05T14:52:44  <thestinger> if the int is odd, it goes left, otherwise right, etc.
2012-01-05T14:53:06  <pairofdice> IIRC mine picked the larger of two to sum up with the upper level
2012-01-05T14:53:37  <thestinger> wow, there are some really elegant solutions in the forums
2012-01-05T14:53:50  <thestinger> zipWith
2012-01-05T14:54:27  <thestinger> looks like everyone brute-forced it anyway :P
2012-01-05T14:54:52  <thestinger> what the hell? one guy used the boost graph library...
2012-01-05T14:55:03  <pairofdice> Uhh
2012-01-05T14:55:23  <thestinger> he just used negative costs
2012-01-05T14:56:12  <thestinger> anyway, time to try out the bigger version of 18
2012-01-05T14:56:29  <thestinger> http://projecteuler.net/project/triangle.txt o_o
2012-01-05T14:56:51  <thestinger> pretty sure it will be faster to read this one in :P
2012-01-05T14:57:03  <pairofdice> Oh damnit. I haven't done that and I've lost the script I did 18 with
2012-01-05T14:57:21  <pairofdice> Oh wait
2012-01-05T14:57:23  <pairofdice> , Yes I have
2012-01-05T14:57:30  <thestinger> after I do a problem I look for the similar ones, with this they were nice enough to give a link
2012-01-05T14:57:43  <thestinger> my solution often isn't good enough for the bigger/harder problem
2012-01-05T14:58:02  <rwest> ahow984_: you figure out the mathematical trick to 15? My tcl script still didn't finish hah
2012-01-05T14:58:04  <pairofdice> I used the same script for both
2012-01-05T14:58:23  <thestinger> rwest: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle
2012-01-05T14:58:55  <thestinger> pairofdice: it was fast enough?
2012-01-05T14:58:57  <thestinger> did you sum every path?
2012-01-05T14:59:00  <pairofdice> No searching involved, I go once through the triangle and the answer's at the top
2012-01-05T14:59:23  <pairofdice> Not saying more than that
2012-01-05T14:59:32  <thestinger> well, I'm going to do a tree search :P
2012-01-05T14:59:39  <thestinger> but first I want to see how long this brute force takes
2012-01-05T14:59:49  <amstan> McLeopold: do we care about small issues about epsilon/ants?
2012-01-05T14:59:55  <rwest> brute force in tcl over an hour
2012-01-05T15:00:03  <thestinger> rwest: for 15?
2012-01-05T15:00:06  <rwest> yea
2012-01-05T15:00:07  <rwest> haha
2012-01-05T15:00:16  <rwest> tcl is slow
2012-01-05T15:00:17  <rwest> haha
2012-01-05T15:00:22  <thestinger> I did brute force in python3, and it took around a second
2012-01-05T15:00:36  <thestinger> I just calculated all the triangle numbers and had them in a data structure
2012-01-05T15:00:37  <pairofdice> And here I was thinking my methods were all brute force
2012-01-05T15:00:41  <thestinger> I guess that's dynamic programming?
2012-01-05T15:00:45  <rwest> thestinger: not the triangle
2012-01-05T15:00:47  <thestinger> anyway, then I just wrote a binomial coefficient function
2012-01-05T15:00:51  <thestinger> rwest: I know
2012-01-05T15:00:55  <rwest> I did every path, recursively
2012-01-05T15:00:56  <thestinger> the one with the # of maths
2012-01-05T15:01:01  <thestinger> that's an n choose k problem
2012-01-05T15:01:08  <rwest> divide and conquer
2012-01-05T15:01:09  <thestinger> the numbers are the same as pascal's triangle
2012-01-05T15:01:10  <rwest> lol
2012-01-05T15:01:13  <thestinger> I didn't realize that
2012-01-05T15:01:17  <thestinger> so I was doing it manually

2012-01-05T15:01:35  <thestinger> I think there was a similar problem and I had to optimize it
2012-01-05T15:01:45  <pairofdice> My solution for the big triangle took less than 100ms IIRC
2012-01-05T15:01:57  <thestinger> anyway, it's just 2*20 choose 20
2012-01-05T15:02:51  <rwest> tcl script finished
2012-01-05T15:02:51  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/hEfA in haskell I ended up with that
2012-01-05T15:02:52  <rwest> done lol
2012-01-05T15:03:08  <thestinger> much faster than just copying the algorithm directly
2012-01-05T15:03:34  <thestinger> I forget which problem I needed that for...
2012-01-05T15:03:37  <thestinger> it had to be really fast
2012-01-05T15:03:55  <thestinger> the normal recursive or factorial algorithms didn't work
2012-01-05T15:04:33  <thestinger> anyway iirc, it was an iterative solution and I turned it into that
2012-01-05T15:04:53  <pairofdice> 20?

2012-01-05T15:05:52  <thestinger> looks like I just did brute force for pretty much all the first 30 problems
2012-01-05T15:05:54  <thestinger> in python...
2012-01-05T15:07:11  <amstan> hmm
2012-01-05T15:07:18  <amstan> that would be a great anti spam measure for the forums
2012-01-05T15:07:35  <amstan> only allow posting after you uploaded a submission
2012-01-05T15:07:57  <amstan> it could be made harder by not counting starter bots
2012-01-05T15:08:00  <thestinger> spammers are pretty smart :P
2012-01-05T15:08:10  <amstan> so then the spammers would have to actually compete in the contest in order to post spam on the forums

2012-01-05T15:09:15  <thestinger> What is the output of "date -u +%W`uname`|sha256sum|sed 's/\W//g'"?
2012-01-05T15:09:17  <pairofdice> amstan: reminds me of an xkcd

2012-01-05T15:11:00  <amstan> we just have to make sure to not lose any competitors because of it
2012-01-05T15:12:36  <thestinger> McLeopold: there, I did it your way
2012-01-05T15:12:41  <thestinger> reading in from a file :)
2012-01-05T15:13:13  <ahow984_> rwest: back now
2012-01-05T15:13:22  <ahow984_> didn't find the math way to do it, no :(
2012-01-05T15:13:41  <thestinger> if only coding functionally in python wasn't so hideous
2012-01-05T15:13:44  <ahow984_> Just going to start my recursive one now, should get an answer in about 20 mins lol
2012-01-05T15:13:46  <rwest> ahow984_: I got the answer done :)
2012-01-05T15:13:51  <ahow984_> :)
2012-01-05T15:13:53  <ahow984_> nice
2012-01-05T15:13:54  <rwest> ahow984_: you can't do it in c
2012-01-05T15:13:57  <ahow984_> lol
2012-01-05T15:14:03  <ahow984_> I just thought of something crazy
2012-01-05T15:14:06  <thestinger> rwest: you can use gmp
2012-01-05T15:14:06  <rwest> unless you use a bignum libraru
2012-01-05T15:14:16  <rwest> thestinger: that thing is such a pain
2012-01-05T15:14:18  <thestinger> gmp is hideous in C though, it's much nicer in C++
2012-01-05T15:14:31  <ahow984_> what happens if you declare a recursive function to be inline?....
2012-01-05T15:14:34  <thestinger> rwest: in C++ they have a class for ints/rational numbers, and the operators are overloaded
2012-01-05T15:14:47  <thestinger> ahow984_: the compiler doesn't care if you put 'inline'
2012-01-05T15:14:48  <rwest> thestinger: ahh, much nicer heh
2012-01-05T15:14:51  <thestinger> turn on -Winline
2012-01-05T15:14:55  <thestinger> it ignores it most of the time
2012-01-05T15:15:10  <rwest> has anybody done problem 12?
2012-01-05T15:15:23  <ahow984_> oh thestinger :/
2012-01-05T15:15:49  <thestinger> ahow984_: gcc has TCO, so it might just turn it into a loop if it's tail-recursive
2012-01-05T15:15:54  <thestinger> s/might/will/
2012-01-05T15:16:16  <rwest> thestinger: should be d&c
2012-01-05T15:16:18  <ahow984_> was thinking shit would be crazy if it was treated inline
2012-01-05T15:16:33  <thestinger> ahow984_: it sometimes tries to inline it
2012-01-05T15:16:47  <thestinger> -Winline will show 10+ warnings, then it will stop since it's making the code bigger
2012-01-05T15:17:07  <ahow984_> heh
2012-01-05T15:17:13  <thestinger> you can actually force inlining with gcc attributes
2012-01-05T15:17:13  <ahow984_> silly compiler
2012-01-05T15:17:28  <McLeopold> amstan: what small issues?
2012-01-05T15:17:30  <thestinger> "flatten" actually inlines all the functions you call in a flattened function
2012-01-05T15:17:35  <ahow984_> inline is pretty useless, it doesn't even make it that much faster....
2012-01-05T15:17:45  <amstan> McLeopold: this stuff: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues?labels=epsilon%2Fants&sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1
2012-01-05T15:17:47  <thestinger> ahow984_: the compiler is smart enough to inline itself
2012-01-05T15:17:59  <thestinger> it does make stuff faster, but not because it avoids a function call
2012-01-05T15:18:03  <ahow984_> yeah, so no need to expressly declare it
2012-01-05T15:18:05  <amstan> McLeopold: i left issues that could be applied to zeta open
2012-01-05T15:18:14  <ahow984_> thestinger: oh, how does it make it faster so?
2012-01-05T15:18:18  <McLeopold> well, I don't care
2012-01-05T15:18:26  <thestinger> ahow984_: function calls are cheap, the speed boost comes because it can optimize the function after inlining it
2012-01-05T15:18:35  <thestinger> there are _many_ passes over the syntax tree to optimize
2012-01-05T15:18:45  <thestinger> stuff is inlined, common expressions are eliminated, etc.
2012-01-05T15:18:51  <thestinger> then that happens again, and again
2012-01-05T15:18:53  <ahow984_> huh
2012-01-05T15:19:04  <thestinger> ahow984_: benchmark C qsort() with std::sort
2012-01-05T15:19:10  <thestinger> std::sort is _way_ faster
2012-01-05T15:19:12  * ahow984_ is glad he never looked at a compiler's source code
2012-01-05T15:19:12  <amstan> McLeopold: are there any changes to ants for archiving?
2012-01-05T15:19:15  <thestinger> not because it gets inlined
2012-01-05T15:19:21  <amstan> McLeopold: or can i tag it?
2012-01-05T15:19:26  <ahow984_> thestinger: weird
2012-01-05T15:19:32  <thestinger> but because qsort uses a function pointer, which can't be inlined into the function
2012-01-05T15:19:50  <thestinger> std::sort gets the comparison function inlined into it, and _then_ it gets optimized more
2012-01-05T15:20:03  <thestinger> assuming it's not some massive comparison function called in 20 other places too
2012-01-05T15:20:09  <ahow984_> huh
2012-01-05T15:20:18  <ahow984_> weird
2012-01-05T15:20:28  <thestinger> anyway, polymorphism in C usually uses function pointers, void casts, etc.
2012-01-05T15:20:42  <thestinger> that usually prevents optimization
2012-01-05T15:20:44  <ahow984_> now expressively inline functions are stupid and complicated
2012-01-05T15:21:10  <amstan> yeah, it looks fine
2012-01-05T15:21:12  <amstan> ok
2012-01-05T15:21:19  <rwest> almost level 2

2012-01-05T15:22:06  <thestinger> 879 us per iteration
2012-01-05T15:22:07  <amstan> McLeopold: what?
2012-01-05T15:22:08  <ahow984_> and std::sort?
2012-01-05T15:22:11  <thestinger> and std::sort

2012-01-05T15:23:01  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-05T15:23:03  <amstan> so now we have it: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tags
2012-01-05T15:23:07  <ahow984_> huh
2012-01-05T15:23:08  <thestinger> that's merge sort, that falls back to insertion sort with under 64 elements
2012-01-05T15:23:10  <McLeopold> amstan: only changes would be to fix whatever is causing our archive slowdown
2012-01-05T15:23:23  <ahow984_> btw, how do you benchmark something?
2012-01-05T15:23:24  <McLeopold> I'm fairly certain it is just the tron database.
2012-01-05T15:23:38  <thestinger> ahow984_: well, I happened to have this lying around :P
2012-01-05T15:23:38  <amstan> well, you turned it off, and it's still doing it right?
2012-01-05T15:23:43  <McLeopold> no
2012-01-05T15:23:45  <McLeopold> it's fast
2012-01-05T15:23:49  <ahow984_> thestinger: :P
2012-01-05T15:23:57  <ahow984_> but how would you do it generally?
2012-01-05T15:24:01  <thestinger> I was doing stuff with parallel sorts and sorting networks
2012-01-05T15:24:01  <McLeopold> last I checked...
2012-01-05T15:24:06  <thestinger> ahow984_: well, timing it in the code is usually best
2012-01-05T15:24:09  <thestinger> python as timeit
2012-01-05T15:24:10  <amstan> McLeopold: who's ddosing though? google/baidu?
2012-01-05T15:24:11  <thestinger> has*
2012-01-05T15:24:34  <McLeopold> I saw googlebot and bingbot earlier, the rest of the traffic looked legit
2012-01-05T15:24:36  <thestinger> ahow984_: running it 10000 times and taking the mean or whatever
2012-01-05T15:24:48  <thestinger> and ignoring the first 20 or so iterations

2012-01-05T15:25:07  <thestinger> slow
2012-01-05T15:25:13  <thestinger> because the stuff isn't in CPU cache yet, etc.
2012-01-05T15:25:17  <ahow984_> ah
2012-01-05T15:25:18  <ahow984_> ok
2012-01-05T15:25:40  <thestinger> in a language with a JIT it will also optimize more

2012-01-05T15:26:08  <ahow984_> I imagined it would be a lot more complex then that :P
2012-01-05T15:26:11  <thestinger> 538 us per iteration
2012-01-05T15:26:16  <ahow984_> ty for the explanation
2012-01-05T15:26:18  <thestinger> threaded merge sort (2 threads) with the same thing
2012-01-05T15:26:31  <thestinger> 386 us per iteration
2012-01-05T15:26:39  <thestinger> and that's a combination of quick and merge sort :P
2012-01-05T15:26:42  <McLeopold> YandexBot?
2012-01-05T15:26:46  <thestinger> does 2 parallel quick sorts and merges them
2012-01-05T15:26:52  <ahow984_> huh
2012-01-05T15:26:58  <thestinger> anyway std::sort is good enough
2012-01-05T15:27:16  <thestinger> I was using this to benchmark C and C++ against Go
2012-01-05T15:27:34  <ahow984_> do people really use Go?!

2012-01-05T15:29:21  <thestinger> they use java, C++ and python mostly
2012-01-05T15:29:23  <g0llum> appengine, for example
2012-01-05T15:29:28  <amstan> McLeopold: which domain?
2012-01-05T15:29:31  <thestinger> I think they want to replace java and C++ with Go for server stuff

2012-01-05T15:34:37  <thestinger> Google acquired Android Inc. on August 17, 2005, making Android Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Google Inc. Key employees of Android Inc., including Andy Rubin, Rich Miner and Chris White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.[11]
2012-01-05T15:35:11  <ahow984_> wow
2012-01-05T15:35:22  <ahow984_> I always thought google devved it from the ground up
2012-01-05T15:36:00  <thestinger> well, they mostly just reuse open-source projects
2012-01-05T15:36:05  <ahow984_> rwest: 20 mins and counting for problem 15 :P
2012-01-05T15:36:12  <thestinger> linux, freetype, webkit, etc.
2012-01-05T15:36:20  <ahow984_> thestinger: yeah, like ChromeOS
2012-01-05T15:36:47  <thestinger> ./solution.py  0.57s user 0.00s system 99% cpu 0.577 total
2012-01-05T15:36:54  <thestinger> well, why did they say brute forcing this wasn't possible? lol
2012-01-05T15:37:14  <ahow984_> where did they say that?
2012-01-05T15:37:16  <thestinger> wait, I screwed it up >.<
2012-01-05T15:37:27  <thestinger> problem 67
2012-01-05T15:37:32  <ahow984_> thats the massive triangle one
2012-01-05T15:37:37  <pairofdice> There's probably another, more brutish approach
2012-01-05T15:37:56  <thestinger> anyway I did it wrong :P
2012-01-05T15:37:56  <ahow984_> yeah :P
2012-01-05T15:38:03  <ahow984_> thats the massive triangle one to me
2012-01-05T15:38:28  <ahow984_> 15 is the paths through a 20*20 maze
2012-01-05T15:38:37  <ahow984_> couldn't find the math way to do it :P :/
2012-01-05T15:38:53  <thestinger> ahow984_: it's pascal's triangle
2012-01-05T15:38:59  <thestinger> you can just calculate the binomial coefficient
2012-01-05T15:39:24  <pairofdice> 15 can be done a hundred different ways
2012-01-05T15:39:27  <ahow984_> >_,
2012-01-05T15:39:29  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-05T15:39:34  <ahow984_> ach
2012-01-05T15:39:39  <ahow984_> how didn't I see that :@
2012-01-05T15:39:46  <thestinger> pairofdice: anyway, I'm just going to do a graph search from the bottom up basically
2012-01-05T15:41:42  <pairofdice> My approach is fairly dumb but very efficient
2012-01-05T15:41:59  <pairofdice> Atleast I thought

2012-01-05T15:43:16  <thestinger> oh
2012-01-05T15:43:55  <thestinger> so you can start at the bottom, and sum them together like that
2012-01-05T15:44:02  <rwest> ahow984_: took tcl over an hour
2012-01-05T15:44:25  <pairofdice> thestinger: yeah, pick the bigger and sum to the upper lever
2012-01-05T15:44:30  <ahow984_> rwest: haha
2012-01-05T15:44:33  <thestinger> ah, is that how you did it?
2012-01-05T15:44:36  <thestinger> you just peak the peak basically
2012-01-05T15:44:37  <pairofdice> Yup
2012-01-05T15:44:53  <ahow984_> rwest: fails the first test of PE, run in < 1 minute ;)
2012-01-05T15:45:06  <thestinger> pairofdice: I can't think of a better way than that :P
2012-01-05T15:45:19  <pairofdice> :)
2012-01-05T15:46:59  <rwest> ahow984_: hah
2012-01-05T15:47:40  <rwest> 22 problems done now
2012-01-05T15:47:49  <McLeopold> amstan: for the next beta period, whatever that game is, I think we should try and minimize the skill gap between the beta participants and final participants
2012-01-05T15:48:03  <amstan> what does that mean?
2012-01-05T15:48:11  <McLeopold> So, we are 3-4 months away from the next contest, building out asteroids right now increases that gap
2012-01-05T15:48:43  <McLeopold> also, for the next beta, I think all bots submitted should be open sourced at the beginning of launch
2012-01-05T15:49:10  <amstan> good points
2012-01-05T15:49:21  <amstan> k, removing my asteroids thing in case we actually do use asteroids
2012-01-05T15:49:22  <rwest> McLeopold: nobody will submit for beta then ^^
2012-01-05T15:49:31  <McLeopold> which is okay
2012-01-05T15:49:37  <amstan> rwest: you shouldn't submit to beta to improve your bot anyway
2012-01-05T15:49:44  <amstan> rwest: you should submit tests to make sure beta works
2012-01-05T15:49:53  <McLeopold> we where testing the backend system
2012-01-05T15:50:00  <thestinger> hmm, but people can still develop locally
2012-01-05T15:50:07  <thestinger> open-sourcing them seems kind of pointless

2012-01-05T15:50:25  <amstan> thestinger: yes, but without any place to upload it will be harder
2012-01-05T15:50:53  <thestinger> amstan: people can just run a tcp server though
2012-01-05T15:51:06  <thestinger> iirc, some people used private tcp servers last time to play with friends/co-workers
2012-01-05T15:51:30  <thestinger> imo, you should just announce the beta
2012-01-05T15:51:32  <amstan> thestinger: sure, but combined with working on the contest last this will be better
2012-01-05T15:51:41  <thestinger> an announcement on the main site, the forums, reddit, etc.
2012-01-05T15:51:53  <amstan> again, beta is not for people compeeting
2012-01-05T15:52:00  <thestinger> yeah, but they will :P
2012-01-05T15:52:12  <amstan> that's their problem, we'll opensource their bot
2012-01-05T15:52:18  <amstan> we can also close the beta

2012-01-05T15:53:32  <thestinger> amstan: is C++11 going to be the default for C++ this time?
2012-01-05T15:53:39  <amstan> thestinger: idk
2012-01-05T15:53:39  <rwest> nevermind during beta
2012-01-05T15:53:59  <amstan> thestinger: i'm gonna push for build systems so it's not my problem
2012-01-05T15:54:01  <g0llum> wouldn't that raise the stake for people trying to begin with the starter bots ?
2012-01-05T15:54:07  <thestinger> amstan: ah, that's a good idea
2012-01-05T15:54:07  <amstan> thestinger: all you'll need is a build.sh
2012-01-05T15:54:23  <thestinger> and you could run sloccount to detect the language
2012-01-05T15:54:26  <thestinger> or languages
2012-01-05T15:54:38  <amstan> thestinger: hmm, good idea
2012-01-05T15:54:46  <amstan> thestinger: can it detect between C/C++
2012-01-05T15:54:52  <amstan> like.. small variances?
2012-01-05T15:55:11  <thestinger> well, it can figure that out based on file extensions, like gcc
2012-01-05T15:55:20  <thestinger> you can actually compile C++ with gcc (not just g++)
2012-01-05T15:56:02  <amstan> i know, but ideally nothing should be calling gcc manually on our end
2012-01-05T15:56:12  <amstan> we'll just call their build script and they can use whatever they want to compile

2012-01-05T15:56:38  <thestinger> because you have to use certain file extensions

2012-01-05T15:56:57  <amstan> thestinger: it can't do a bunch of languages that we use
2012-01-05T15:57:16  <amstan> thestinger: like it can't do go, javascript, ocaml
2012-01-05T15:57:41  <amstan> dart, coffeescript
2012-01-05T15:57:54  <amstan> not sure, another library might be better

2012-01-05T16:03:00  <amstan> thestinger: needs to be ubuntu though
2012-01-05T16:03:06  <thestinger> yeah, it will build on ubuntu
2012-01-05T16:03:17  <thestinger> has a 'build' script, no Makefile apparently
2012-01-05T16:03:33  <amstan> it has a Rakefile
2012-01-05T16:03:42  <thestinger> ah
2012-01-05T16:03:54  <amstan> which calls ./build
2012-01-05T16:03:56  <amstan> lol
2012-01-05T16:04:32  <thestinger> detects javascript for sure
2012-01-05T16:05:59  <thestinger> meh, doesn't detect Go
2012-01-05T16:06:20  <amstan> we could just simplify this by getting another file which contains the language name
2012-01-05T16:07:14  <thestinger> oh, it does detect Go

2012-01-05T16:50:04  <thestinger> lol, I should do these easy problems that I skipped
2012-01-05T16:50:15  <thestinger> 11, 28, etc
2012-01-05T16:50:38  <thestinger> not sure why I skipped them
2012-01-05T16:56:02  <amstan> McLeopold, janzert: #aichallenge-staff is ours now
2012-01-05T16:57:34  <amstan> McLeopold, janzert: we can also pick official aichallenge cloaks, suggestions?
2012-01-05T16:59:21  <janzert> black with a hood and red lining? silk or velvet for the lining though, hmm. :P
2012-01-05T17:00:10  <amstan> aichallenge/velvet? lol
2012-01-05T17:00:41  <janzert> I really obviously don't understand what the question is meaning
2012-01-05T17:01:33  <janzert> ahh, freenode's host masking feature I assume
2012-01-05T17:01:39  <amstan> janzert: it's pretty much the same as unix groups
2012-01-05T17:01:47  <amstan> and it's also used for host masking
2012-01-05T17:01:58  <amstan> do /whois FloodBot1
2012-01-05T17:02:33  <thestinger> well, 11 was easy as hell
2012-01-05T17:02:37  <thestinger> really not sure why I skipped that...

2012-01-05T17:18:17  <thestinger> it would replace barracuda.imagesourceirc.com with aichallenge/admin/McLeopold or whatever
2012-01-05T17:19:00  <amstan> McLeopold: if you go to big open source project channels, and whois the ops in there you'll usually get a customized cloak for each

2012-01-05T17:20:42  <ahow984_> so its pretty much been decided on asteroids then?
2012-01-05T17:21:09  <amstan> ahow984_: not at all
2012-01-05T17:21:45  <ahow984_> oh, I presumed since there hasn't been much talk about anything not asteroids and there was a repo for it :P
2012-01-05T17:22:01  <amstan> yeah, but that doesn't mean it's the best game
2012-01-05T17:22:12  <amstan> i do like it, but we could pick others too
2012-01-05T17:22:28  <ahow984_> yeah

2012-01-05T17:23:22  <ahow984_> seems boring :/
2012-01-05T17:23:33  <ahow984_> not much room for original thought in it
2012-01-05T17:23:41  <amstan> have your played robocode?
2012-01-05T17:23:44  <ahow984_> no
2012-01-05T17:23:54  <ahow984_> I do like the continuous aspect of it though
2012-01-05T17:23:58  <amstan> it's fairly similar, except that you have momentum
2012-01-05T17:23:59  <ahow984_> I know about it though
2012-01-05T17:24:08  <amstan> in robocode it's about tanks and no asteroids
2012-01-05T17:24:12  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-05T17:24:25  <ahow984_> still, I think there could be more original ideas

2012-01-05T17:24:39  <McLeopold> how about we control the asteroids and try to smash the ships?
2012-01-05T17:24:44  <ahow984_> haxball was a good idea IMO
2012-01-05T17:25:04  <ahow984_> her was my spin on the game:
2012-01-05T17:25:28  <ahow984_> the asteroids don't actually blow up, and you can't shoot people directly
2012-01-05T17:25:37  <ahow984_> you have to crush them with the asteroid
2012-01-05T17:25:47  <ahow984_> would make it a lot more challenging
2012-01-05T17:26:01  <amstan> if we were to do asteroids i think it would be nice if you could shoot asteroids to split them in 2 and shoot players directly
2012-01-05T17:26:08  <amstan> i think they're both usable strategies

2012-01-05T17:26:57  <McLeopold> heat-seeking asteroids would be better
2012-01-05T17:27:03  <ahow984_> heh, :)
2012-01-05T17:27:19  <pairofdice> Yeah
2012-01-05T17:27:43  <McLeopold> or a game like top-gun for the original NES
2012-01-05T17:28:15  <McLeopold> or x-wing vs tie-fighter...
2012-01-05T17:28:26  <amstan> oh! i get it
2012-01-05T17:28:46  <amstan> haxball is like soccer
2012-01-05T17:28:52  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-05T17:29:00  <pairofdice> haxball looked nice
2012-01-05T17:30:12  <amstan> i could do a demo for that one too

2012-01-05T17:58:19  <ahow984_> and hard-code in the places?
2012-01-05T17:58:42  <amstan> from a[x,y] you can move down to a[x+1,y+1] a[x+1,y] or up to a[x-1,y-1] and a[x-1,y]
2012-01-05T17:59:00  <amstan> oh..
2012-01-05T17:59:01  <ahow984_> ah
2012-01-05T17:59:02  <amstan> only down
2012-01-05T17:59:03  <amstan> ok
2012-01-05T17:59:06  <amstan> so only the first 1
2012-01-05T17:59:08  <amstan> 2*
2012-01-05T17:59:14  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-05T17:59:25  <ahow984_> it was the triangle shape that was throwing me
2012-01-05T17:59:26  <amstan> oh, so it's just a search problem
2012-01-05T17:59:33  <amstan> you have a tree
2012-01-05T17:59:41  <amstan> find longest path
2012-01-05T17:59:44  <ahow984_> I didn't know how I could access the values
2012-01-05T18:00:07  <ahow984_> so just brute force every path?
2012-01-05T18:00:11  <amstan> no
2012-01-05T18:00:23  <amstan> can you answer wrong?
2012-01-05T18:00:28  <amstan> or do you lose points?
2012-01-05T18:00:32  <ahow984_> nah
2012-01-05T18:00:37  <ahow984_> you don't lose points
2012-01-05T18:00:47  <ahow984_> you just keep trying until you get it right ;)
2012-01-05T18:00:56  <amstan> you could make al algorithm
2012-01-05T18:01:00  <amstan> an*
2012-01-05T18:01:10  <amstan> for each row, you have to decide where to go next
2012-01-05T18:01:14  <amstan> you have 2 choices
2012-01-05T18:01:21  <amstan> you could try always going toward the biggest number
2012-01-05T18:01:49  <ahow984_> hmm, doubt that would work....
2012-01-05T18:01:54  <amstan> but that won't guarantee the maximum
2012-01-05T18:02:28  <amstan> it works for the first example
2012-01-05T18:02:40  <amstan> look into breadth first search
2012-01-05T18:02:44  <ahow984_> I know it

2012-01-05T18:31:09  <thestinger> I just do that from the bottom up
2012-01-05T18:31:30  <mcstar> ah
2012-01-05T18:31:34  <mcstar> from bottom up
2012-01-05T18:32:08  <thestinger> so it starts at the second row from the bottom, and gets the biggest sum for each
2012-01-05T18:32:11  <thestinger> etc.
2012-01-05T18:32:40  <mcstar> i had that idea for the little problem but i thought it wont wokr

2012-01-05T18:36:57  <mcstar> maybe i wasnt sure if it always give the largest value
2012-01-05T18:36:59  <mcstar> dunno
2012-01-05T18:37:21  <mcstar> anyway, i did it with a bfs from the top
2012-01-05T18:38:16  <mcstar> thestinger: but i like your python code
2012-01-05T18:38:30  <mcstar> i wonder if i could do a similar one in haskell
2012-01-05T18:38:45  <mcstar> without destructively updating the triangle[][]
2012-01-05T18:39:22  <mcstar> yep i could
2012-01-05T18:40:04  <mcstar> with open("triangle.txt", "r") as f:
2012-01-05T18:40:06  <mcstar>     triangle = [(list(map(int, line[:-1].split()))) for line in f]
2012-01-05T18:40:09  <mcstar> this is powerful
2012-01-05T18:40:35  <thestinger> I could have actually made it more pythonic by removing map()
2012-01-05T18:40:38  <mcstar> its 15 lines in c++
2012-01-05T18:40:42  <thestinger> and just doing it all in the list comprehension
2012-01-05T18:40:57  <amstan> i want my map
2012-01-05T18:41:00  <thestinger> python list comprehensions are based on haskell's, but they use a syntax that looks like a for loop
2012-01-05T18:41:10  <thestinger> [x * x for x in range(10)]
2012-01-05T18:41:12  <amstan> i will always pick map over list comprehension except when i need to write a lambda
2012-01-05T18:41:13  <mcstar> i know python
2012-01-05T18:41:14  <amstan> but even then
2012-01-05T18:41:16  <thestinger> mcstar: ah :)
2012-01-05T18:41:17  <mcstar> (not like you)
2012-01-05T18:41:24  <mcstar> i just dont use it much
2012-01-05T18:41:39  <thestinger> I love it for hacking stuff together quickly, like this
2012-01-05T18:41:43  <mcstar> i even read about this with statement
2012-01-05T18:41:57  <pairofdice> I love list comprehensions
2012-01-05T18:42:10  <mcstar> thestinger: i never felt comfortable editing python code
2012-01-05T18:42:14  <mcstar> what do you use?
2012-01-05T18:42:28  <mcstar> (i want something similar to common lisp"s repl in emacs: slime)
2012-01-05T18:42:30  <thestinger> vim
2012-01-05T18:42:36  <mcstar> unacceptable
2012-01-05T18:42:40  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-05T18:42:42  <thestinger> well
2012-01-05T18:42:42  <mcstar> for exploratory programming
2012-01-05T18:42:44  <thestinger> text objects are nice
2012-01-05T18:42:54  <thestinger> I have a plugin that turns indented blocks into text objects
2012-01-05T18:43:06  <thestinger> a text object is like iw (inner-word), i" (inner-quotes)
2012-01-05T18:43:49  <mcstar> i found ipython qtconsole the most useful
2012-01-05T18:43:54  <thestinger> bpython is nice
2012-01-05T18:44:03  <thestinger> there's vim-conque, which lets you run stuff inside a vim buffer
2012-01-05T18:44:08  <thestinger> https://code.google.com/p/conque/
2012-01-05T18:44:12  <thestinger> makes it like emacs basically
2012-01-05T18:44:36  <mcstar> then it makes sense to use emacs instead
2012-01-05T18:44:42  <thestinger> meh
2012-01-05T18:44:48  <mcstar> :D

2012-01-05T18:47:08  <mcstar> i always thought theres better support i emacs
2012-01-05T18:47:21  <mcstar> it always supported those "inferior shells"
2012-01-05T18:47:25  <mcstar> heard of them?

2012-01-05T18:47:59  <thestinger> oh, so just a subshell in a buffer basically?
2012-01-05T18:48:15  <mcstar> it can interact with a dozen programs
2012-01-05T18:48:25  <mcstar> like the common lisp repl, the haskell repl
2012-01-05T18:48:28  <mcstar> the ocaml
2012-01-05T18:48:32  <thestinger> well, for example vim can be built with python support
2012-01-05T18:48:33  <mcstar> the name any other one
2012-01-05T18:48:44  <thestinger> and it has autocompletion etc. without plugins
2012-01-05T18:49:04  <thestinger> python and lua are actually the languages used to make vim plugins, if you aren't brain damaged (ugh... vimscript)
2012-01-05T18:49:08  <mcstar> can you send delimited regions to python?
2012-01-05T18:49:13  <mcstar> (guess you can)
2012-01-05T18:49:21  <thestinger> well, for example
2012-01-05T18:49:22  <mcstar> i know
2012-01-05T18:49:23  <thestinger> cai
2012-01-05T18:49:33  <thestinger> deletes a whole indented block and puts me in insert mode
2012-01-05T18:49:52  <thestinger> ai is a "an indented block" (a text object) added by a plugin
2012-01-05T18:50:06  <thestinger> ii is "inner indented block"
2012-01-05T18:50:29  <thestinger> vim comes with many text objects but you need to make those with ~15 lines of code (or use a premade plugin)
2012-01-05T18:50:41  <mcstar> but you have to exit insert mode to send regions to the buffer
2012-01-05T18:51:03  <thestinger> that's not that bad :P
2012-01-05T18:51:12  <thestinger> caps lock is bound to escape
2012-01-05T18:51:22  <mcstar> or ^c
2012-01-05T18:51:27  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-05T18:51:39  <mcstar> i have insert on space
2012-01-05T18:51:48  <mcstar> and replace is bound to insert
2012-01-05T18:51:50  <mcstar> in my config
2012-01-05T18:51:59  <mcstar> i hate eccidentally entering replace mode
2012-01-05T18:52:03  <mcstar> A
2012-01-05T18:52:23  <thestinger> you rebound A to that? :P
2012-01-05T18:52:32  <mcstar> ac...
2012-01-05T18:53:08  <thestinger> I also like clang_complete a lot, because I don't need to refer to C++ docs
2012-01-05T18:53:11  <mcstar> (but i still have to admit, c++ is best edited in kdevelop)
2012-01-05T18:53:19  <mcstar> ah
2012-01-05T18:53:20  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-05T18:53:22  <thestinger> and it finds syntax errors, etc.
2012-01-05T18:53:25  <mcstar> yep
2012-01-05T18:53:37  <thestinger> it's a vim plugin, but someone could write an emacs version
2012-01-05T18:53:39  <mcstar> i use kdevelop because of this)
2012-01-05T18:53:45  <thestinger> xcode uses it I guess, so it's part of clang
2012-01-05T18:54:22  <mcstar> thestinger: and do you use vim or gvim?
2012-01-05T18:54:31  <thestinger> gvim, but set up to look like vim basically
2012-01-05T18:54:34  <thestinger> gvim has nicer colors
2012-01-05T18:54:38  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-05T18:54:48  <mcstar> and fonts
2012-01-05T18:54:58  <thestinger> yeah, a bit nicer
2012-01-05T18:55:03  <thestinger> urxvt uses libxft which is crap
2012-01-05T18:55:32  <mcstar> i have mrxvt on my latop
2012-01-05T18:55:32  <thestinger> I use Consolas and it looks awful without freetype2-infinality
2012-01-05T18:55:43  <mcstar> +1 for infinality
2012-01-05T18:55:56  <thestinger> also, gvim has 'a' for guioptions
2012-01-05T18:56:10  <thestinger> which automatically puts anything you select in visual mode into the SELECTION clipboard buffer in X
2012-01-05T18:57:02  <mcstar> aaa

2012-01-05T18:58:07  <thestinger> mcstar: have you used the C++11 function syntax yet?
2012-01-05T18:58:19  <mcstar> what do you mean?
2012-01-05T18:58:23  <thestinger> I don't think you can write a generic sum(container) for example without it
2012-01-05T18:58:27  <thestinger> well
2012-01-05T18:58:32  <thestinger> int something(int i) { }
2012-01-05T18:58:40  <thestinger> auto something(int i) -> int { }
2012-01-05T18:58:44  <thestinger> the second is the new syntax
2012-01-05T18:58:49  <thestinger> lets you use an inferred type
2012-01-05T18:58:50  <mcstar> i didnt need it to
2012-01-05T18:58:55  <mcstar> and decltype
2012-01-05T18:58:58  <mcstar> and ...
2012-01-05T18:59:04  <mcstar> and constexpr
2012-01-05T18:59:16  <thestinger> constexpr is barely useful
2012-01-05T18:59:47  <mcstar> i dont have any practical example :)
2012-01-05T19:00:16  <mcstar> thestinger: hm
2012-01-05T19:00:22  <mcstar> whats the point of that example?
2012-01-05T19:00:25  <thestinger> none
2012-01-05T19:00:26  <mcstar> auto something(int i) -> int { }
2012-01-05T19:00:27  <thestinger> lol
2012-01-05T19:00:28  <mcstar> ?
2012-01-05T19:00:31  <thestinger> just shows the syntax
2012-01-05T19:00:41  <thestinger> auto something(int i) -> decltype(something) { }
2012-01-05T19:00:42  <mcstar> auto something(int i, float f) -> decltype(i*f) { }
2012-01-05T19:00:45  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-05T19:01:05  <thestinger> or you can use stuff derived from templates
2012-01-05T19:01:50  <thestinger> template<typename T> auto something(int i) -> typename T::value_type { }
2012-01-05T19:01:53  <thestinger> I think that's the right syntax
2012-01-05T19:02:18  <mcstar> i dont get it
2012-01-05T19:02:26  <thestinger> well, lets say T is a std::vector<int>
2012-01-05T19:02:30  <thestinger> T::value_type is int
2012-01-05T19:02:39  <mcstar> i didnt know about that
2012-01-05T19:02:47  <mcstar> (ive seen it in errors)
2012-01-05T19:02:57  <thestinger> templated classes can define typedefs like that
2012-01-05T19:03:11  <thestinger> like there's std::remove_reference
2012-01-05T19:03:24  <thestinger> so you can turn 'int &' into 'int'
2012-01-05T19:03:26  <thestinger> etc.
2012-01-05T19:03:29  <thestinger> well, for types
2012-01-05T19:03:44  <mcstar> what a nightmare this language becomes
2012-01-05T19:03:49  <thestinger> lol, yeah
2012-01-05T19:04:02  <thestinger> mcstar: btw, you know they have a generic fold in the standard library?
2012-01-05T19:04:06  <thestinger> you can make your own easily anyway
2012-01-05T19:04:19  <mcstar> fold?
2012-01-05T19:04:28  <mcstar> as in list folding?
2012-01-05T19:04:32  <thestinger> yes
2012-01-05T19:04:50  <thestinger> std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 1, mul<int>);
2012-01-05T19:04:58  <thestinger> that's product() for any standard lib container
2012-01-05T19:05:00  <thestinger> etc.
2012-01-05T19:05:16  <mcstar> i didnt pay much attention to it
2012-01-05T19:05:37  <mcstar> but theres somethign in it i like
2012-01-05T19:05:43  <mcstar> namely the end itarator
2012-01-05T19:05:53  <mcstar> in a funtional language you have to fold the whole list
2012-01-05T19:06:03  <mcstar> or else you mess up your folder function
2012-01-05T19:06:33  <mcstar> hm

2012-01-05T19:11:12  <thestinger> well, I'm pretty sure I hate real OOP...
2012-01-05T19:11:19  <mcstar> thestinger: you dont have the problem to code like that
2012-01-05T19:11:26  <thestinger> when python libraries force me to use it pisses me off
2012-01-05T19:11:42  <thestinger> , it pisses me off*
2012-01-05T19:11:59  <thestinger> they force you to inherit from some class and implement random magic methods
2012-01-05T19:12:01  <mcstar> well, i think it might fit for gui programming
2012-01-05T19:12:07  <mcstar> you have a lot of state there
2012-01-05T19:12:13  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-05T19:12:32  <mcstar> thestinger: did you code i qt?
2012-01-05T19:12:39  <thestinger> no, haven't used Qt
2012-01-05T19:12:50  <thestinger> I've done GUI stuff with javascript and I hate it :P
2012-01-05T19:12:52  <mcstar> i felt in my brief excursion to qt land, that it is well designed
2012-01-05T19:13:16  <thestinger> well, javascript is just a pretty crappy language
2012-01-05T19:13:38  <mcstar> you sound like you should learn cl

2012-01-05T19:14:27  <mcstar> except haskells type system

2012-01-05T19:29:40  <mcstar> yes?
2012-01-05T19:29:49  <ahow984_> did bfs work for you for #18 and #67?
2012-01-05T19:30:08  <ahow984_> I don't see how thats shorter then brute force....
2012-01-05T19:30:15  <mcstar> it runs 4 times faster than thestinger's python code
2012-01-05T19:30:22  <mcstar> on my machine
2012-01-05T19:30:30  <mcstar> so it means its a worse algoritm
2012-01-05T19:30:30  <ahow984_> thats an achievement :)
2012-01-05T19:30:34  <mcstar> no
2012-01-05T19:30:41  <mcstar> c++ vs python
2012-01-05T19:30:48  <mcstar> it should be much faster :)
2012-01-05T19:30:52  <ahow984_> i7 vs dual core?
2012-01-05T19:30:54  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-05T19:31:03  <mcstar> no, on my machine
2012-01-05T19:31:08  <ahow984_> oh
2012-01-05T19:31:11  <ahow984_> still fast enough
2012-01-05T19:31:18  <mcstar> 31ms vs 200 ms
2012-01-05T19:31:27  <ahow984_> did you ever do them olympiad things?
2012-01-05T19:31:37  <ahow984_> I'm doing one tomorrow if you want to see the problems?
2012-01-05T19:31:39  <mcstar> what kind of?
2012-01-05T19:31:44  <ahow984_> programming
2012-01-05T19:31:46  <mcstar> in physics an math
2012-01-05T19:31:48  <mcstar> d
2012-01-05T19:31:55  <mcstar> but little success
2012-01-05T19:31:56  <ahow984_> mostly just math
2012-01-05T19:32:04  <ahow984_> oh, you did do them :)
2012-01-05T19:32:23  <mcstar> it was some high-school coutry wide thing
2012-01-05T19:32:30  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-05T19:32:42  <ahow984_> I came 4th in .ie last year with programming :)
2012-01-05T19:32:51  <ahow984_> and going to come 1st this year ;)
2012-01-05T19:32:57  <mcstar> hm
2012-01-05T19:33:04  <ahow984_> I might be doing the math one this year too
2012-01-05T19:33:12  <ahow984_> (Ireland's standard is really low lol)
2012-01-05T19:33:26  <mcstar> im wondering if i knew how to program recursively when i was your age
2012-01-05T19:33:47  <mcstar> i was messing around with lcc-win32
2012-01-05T19:33:50  <ahow984_> but yeah, the USA let anyone do their contests so I'm signed up for one tomorrow :P
2012-01-05T19:34:18  <mcstar> good luck
2012-01-05T19:34:24  <ahow984_> ty
2012-01-05T19:34:31  <ahow984_> it's not serious for me
2012-01-05T19:34:37  <ahow984_> just practise for the irish one :)
2012-01-05T19:35:00  <mcstar> just make sure to kick ass
2012-01-05T19:35:54  <pairofdice> recursion blows my mind, not in a good way
2012-01-05T19:36:06  <ahow984_> pairofdice: join the club :P
2012-01-05T19:36:21  <ahow984_> mcstar: managed to teach me a little though :)
2012-01-05T19:37:51  <mcstar> once you understand the cons cell, you understand it all
2012-01-05T19:38:07  <ahow984_> cons cell?
2012-01-05T19:38:31  <mcstar> yes

2012-01-05T19:39:25  <ahow984_> oh jesus....
2012-01-05T19:40:15  <ahow984_> why are they important?
2012-01-05T19:40:31  <mcstar> thats the structure of a list
2012-01-05T19:40:42  <mcstar> the very basic data structure you can have
2012-01-05T19:40:48  <ahow984_> oh
2012-01-05T19:40:57  <ahow984_> List in C++ is a separate data type
2012-01-05T19:41:11  <mcstar> separate from what?
2012-01-05T19:41:26  <ahow984_> sorry
2012-01-05T19:41:35  <ahow984_> as in #include <list>
2012-01-05T19:41:39  <ahow984_> not native
2012-01-05T19:41:50  <mcstar> anyway, lists in c++ are awkward
2012-01-05T19:41:58  <ahow984_> yes, they're horrible
2012-01-05T19:41:59  <mcstar> you cant really do fun stuff with them
2012-01-05T19:42:08  <ahow984_> I forced myself to use one to try and learn but bleh
2012-01-05T19:42:19  <mcstar> hm
2012-01-05T19:42:28  <mcstar> we arent talking about the same things probably
2012-01-05T19:42:52  <ahow984_> LIFO data structure?
2012-01-05T19:43:11  <ahow984_> I thought there was only one type of list...
2012-01-05T19:44:32  <mcstar> by list i mean a singly linked cell string
2012-01-05T19:44:35  <mcstar> anyway
2012-01-05T19:45:07  <mcstar> my point was, that i said its awkward in c++ because you have to imperatively define variables
2012-01-05T19:45:32  <mcstar> but in funtional languages the list is more basic, and you can just throw them around
2012-01-05T19:45:46  <ahow984_> hmm
2012-01-05T19:46:01  <mcstar> and im guessing, you just didnt like them because of the interface?
2012-01-05T19:46:58  <ahow984_> yes :P
2012-01-05T19:49:10  <mcstar> getting late
2012-01-05T19:49:32  <mcstar> i watch a couple of k1 rounds, and im ko

2012-01-05T22:31:22  <thestinger> one of the most fun

2012-01-05T22:37:56  <thestinger> oh, forgot to enter that answer
2012-01-05T22:37:58  <thestinger> there
2012-01-05T22:38:25  <antimatroid> i prodded my friend about project euler
2012-01-05T22:38:28  <antimatroid> he's solved 70
2012-01-05T22:38:31  <antimatroid> including the first 50
2012-01-05T22:40:14  <thestinger> I'll do 81 to 83 then next
2012-01-05T22:40:53  <antimatroid> do 83 first
2012-01-05T22:41:05  <antimatroid> then you should be able to just restrict the movement for the other two
2012-01-05T22:42:32  <thestinger> oh, that's easy :D
2012-01-05T22:42:40  <antimatroid> yep :P
2012-01-05T22:42:57  <thestinger> anyway, 59 was fun
2012-01-05T22:43:01  <thestinger> maybe not in C++
2012-01-05T22:43:31  <thestinger> I really love list comprehensions and functional stuff (partial functions, etc.) for this
2012-01-05T22:44:05  <antimatroid> yeah i need to learn some new languages anyway
2012-01-05T22:44:22  <antimatroid> ants got me interested in programming again
2012-01-05T22:44:27  <antimatroid> i was fairly meh about it for a while

2012-01-05T23:31:04  <thestinger> antimatroid: anyway, I barely even did a graph search for those :P
2012-01-05T23:32:06  <thestinger> just made a generator function to yield adjacent nodes
2012-01-05T23:32:32  <thestinger> it would have been nice to code my ants bot in python, but sadly it's way too slow :(
2012-01-05T23:36:15  <thestinger> antimatroid: how did you do 99? logarithms?
2012-01-05T23:36:24  <thestinger> I guess it's fast since you just use floats
2012-01-05T23:38:39  *** Israfel <Israfel!~jeff@99-0-14-82.lightspeed.frokca.sbcglobal.net> has joined #aichallenge
2012-01-05T23:41:49  <thestinger> yup, that worked
2012-01-05T23:52:21  <thestinger> anyway, I feel bad for coding python like this http://sprunge.us/BhhD
