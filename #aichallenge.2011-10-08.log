2011-10-08T02:19:42  <McLeopold> do you know ruby?
2011-10-08T02:20:07  <mleise> no. and i don't even know if i ever saw a bit of ruby code
2011-10-08T02:20:56  <McLeopold> mleise: looks like I missed embedded on a few
2011-10-08T02:22:00  <mleise> I could have fixed that myself, but then you would just have added more replays later on without the embedded flag set ^^
2011-10-08T02:22:39  <mleise> I should have checked the forums more frequently. There were quite some issues with the visualizer discussed.
