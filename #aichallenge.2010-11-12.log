2010-11-12T00:00:01  <Zannick> it seems to me like you're trying to prevent coordinates from being close to integer values
2010-11-12T00:00:28  <Zannick> sigh: :P
2010-11-12T00:00:45  <antimatroid> Zannick: i was told to explicitly exclude integer coordinates
2010-11-12T00:01:01  <janzert> not integer coordinates
2010-11-12T00:01:03  <Zannick> what??
2010-11-12T00:01:08  <antimatroid> ?
2010-11-12T00:01:10  <janzert> near integer distances
2010-11-12T00:01:15  <sigh> Zannick: yes, to prevent possible rounding errors
2010-11-12T00:01:17  <antimatroid> oh okay, i need to change that thena
2010-11-12T00:01:33  <antimatroid> and it wasn't checking it for home planets, will fix that up too
2010-11-12T00:01:51  <Zannick> hm
2010-11-12T00:02:01  <Zannick> i guess that's kind of legit
2010-11-12T00:02:07  <Zannick> for distances, at least
2010-11-12T00:02:08  <sigh> errr... it doesn't matter if the coordinates are near integers
2010-11-12T00:02:10  <sigh> only distances
2010-11-12T00:02:53  <antimatroid> yeah, i see that now :P
2010-11-12T00:03:24  <antimatroid> i think i said last night my life philosophy is do first think later
2010-11-12T00:03:36  <sigh> code should check abs(distance) < epsilon or abs(distance) - 1 > epsilon
2010-11-12T00:03:53  <sigh> err.. ignore that
2010-11-12T00:03:56  <antimatroid> :P
2010-11-12T00:05:12  <sigh> meh, you are smart enough to figure it out
2010-11-12T00:06:25  <Zannick> except you want to use the nonrounded form of distance for that
2010-11-12T00:06:34  <sigh> yup

2010-11-12T00:10:31  <Zannick> that was a way of establishing different minimum distances between planets
2010-11-12T00:11:02  <antimatroid> threshold based on growth rate?
2010-11-12T00:11:04  <Zannick> it would be useful to keep that, though
2010-11-12T00:11:14  <sigh> sure, but that was used on top of the <= 1 requirement

2010-11-12T00:12:05  <Zannick> let's see, 0.4 * the sum of the square roots of the growth rates
2010-11-12T00:12:10  <antimatroid> that was a "what the fuck are you talking about" question mark
2010-11-12T00:12:23  <Zannick> was the minimum distance between two planets
2010-11-12T00:12:31  <sigh> line 36 in the original script: if dist < threshold or dist <= 1:
2010-11-12T00:12:35  <Zannick> and that could be 0.8 for some cases
2010-11-12T00:13:12  <Zannick> wait, haha
2010-11-12T00:13:37  <Zannick> the biggest that would be is 0.4 * (sqrt(5) + sqrt(5))
2010-11-12T00:13:41  <Zannick> which is less than
2010-11-12T00:13:43  <Zannick> which is less than 2
2010-11-12T00:13:57  <Zannick> hahahaha
2010-11-12T00:14:04  <Zannick> antimatroid: no, you're perfectly fine without that
2010-11-12T00:14:21  <Zannick> since you basically are using a bigger minimum distance

2010-11-12T00:19:45  <janzert> how hard would it be to instead ensure there is a neutral with cost less than 5 * home world distance
2010-11-12T00:20:13  <Zannick> make it the first neutral generated
2010-11-12T00:20:29  <janzert> at least I think that is the correct formula, someone who is actually playing and thinking about these things feel free to chime in on that :)
2010-11-12T00:20:47  <sigh> that's enough strict enough
2010-11-12T00:20:47  <antimatroid> janzert: easy, i'll just make sure the first two neutrals added meet that
2010-11-12T00:21:05  <sigh> actually
2010-11-12T00:21:08  <Zannick> wait, home world distance...as in dist(p1, p2)?
2010-11-12T00:21:22  <Zannick> hm, i see what that entials
2010-11-12T00:21:25  <Zannick> entails
2010-11-12T00:21:28  <janzert> right distance between the two
2010-11-12T00:21:33  <janzert> two home worlds
2010-11-12T00:21:33  <antimatroid> hold on, i'll do it then let you guys look
2010-11-12T00:21:46  <sigh> actually... that formula is fine
2010-11-12T00:22:34  <sigh> I think it is better to just not make the home planets too close
2010-11-12T00:22:45  <antimatroid> wait, i need to restrict the number of ships to 25 too?
2010-11-12T00:23:00  <antimatroid> the neutral doesn't even need to be within that distance
2010-11-12T00:23:08  <antimatroid> there needs to be a neutral with planets < 25?
2010-11-12T00:23:14  <antimatroid> with ships*
2010-11-12T00:23:16  <janzert> antimatroid the only restriction on the neutral is number of ships
2010-11-12T00:23:21  <sigh> the position of the planet doesn't matter, only cost
2010-11-12T00:23:39  <antimatroid> okay, so first neutrals added have ships in [1, 25)?
2010-11-12T00:23:53  <sigh> 5*distance(p1,p2)
2010-11-12T00:24:02  <antimatroid> yes der :P
2010-11-12T00:24:05  <antimatroid> okay, hold up
2010-11-12T00:24:13  <janzert> [1, 5*distance(p1,p2))
2010-11-12T00:24:26  <sigh> you can make the range inclusive
2010-11-12T00:24:31  <sigh> if you want
2010-11-12T00:24:41  <antimatroid> i think it's better if it's not
2010-11-12T00:25:05  <janzert> and you could make the home world distance minimum down lower then
2010-11-12T00:25:44  <sigh> it still doesn't stop draws though... map 30 obeys this condition and is still a boring map
2010-11-12T00:26:20  <janzert> any chance you have a handy playback showing map 30
2010-11-12T00:27:25  <janzert> nm found it on tcp
2010-11-12T00:27:50  <sigh> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=976319 for everyone else
2010-11-12T00:28:03  <janzert> map 30 doesn't  follow that rule does it?
2010-11-12T00:28:19  <sigh> it is possible to aquire the 20 in the corner
2010-11-12T00:29:01  <janzert> how far are the home planets, 4?
2010-11-12T00:29:06  <janzert> or only 3
2010-11-12T00:29:20  <sigh> I think 5
2010-11-12T00:29:44  <eburnette_> startDist is 5
2010-11-12T00:29:59  <antimatroid> janzert: i was just thinking, i'll remove starting distance being greater than 2
2010-11-12T00:30:03  <antimatroid> i think it's fine now
2010-11-12T00:30:12  <Zannick> does it obey the condition ignoring the center planet?
2010-11-12T00:30:22  <janzert> hmm, ok so you can expand to the 20 planet but no farther basically
2010-11-12T00:30:41  <sigh> unless opponent is stupid: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=978085
2010-11-12T00:30:48  <antimatroid> if home distances are 2, just means there exists neutrals for both players that have ships less than 10
2010-11-12T00:31:02  <janzert> antimatroid: right
2010-11-12T00:31:02  <antimatroid> if both bots suck, that's their fault
2010-11-12T00:31:10  <sigh> :(
2010-11-12T00:31:50  <eburnette_> if your opponent is not ragebot you can get planet 8 and 21 (starting at 2)
2010-11-12T00:32:56  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2010-11-12T00:33:10  <janzert> how about this will the top 100 bots always at least draw map 30?
2010-11-12T00:33:34  <janzert> if so then we probably need to start worrying about disallowing it
2010-11-12T00:33:40  <sigh> janzert: I think so
2010-11-12T00:33:47  <Zannick> i would think a really good bot should be able to win.
2010-11-12T00:33:49  <eburnette_> can you be in the top 100 and be beaten by ragebot?
2010-11-12T00:33:49  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/JuoNVCba take 3
2010-11-12T00:34:00  <sigh> Zannick: prove it :)
2010-11-12T00:34:27  <janzert> but it will probably still be easier to do it manually than fixing the generator to not create them in the first place
2010-11-12T00:34:27  <Zannick> it was mentioned that one could take a 20-planet
2010-11-12T00:34:30  <sigh> eburnette_: easily
2010-11-12T00:35:00  <Zannick> if that's true, then the distance from 1 to 2 is at least 5
2010-11-12T00:35:03  <sigh> that might be an idea though... force everyone to play ragebot in main tournament
2010-11-12T00:35:08  <janzert> sigh: but you think they all win or draw map 30?
2010-11-12T00:35:09  <sigh> :P
2010-11-12T00:35:21  <sigh> janzert: draw against other top bots
2010-11-12T00:35:25  <Zannick> and doing that ought to be enough to put a player ahead
2010-11-12T00:35:34  <antimatroid> i was just thinking, with map generation in final tournament, would it be possible to generate a new map every time a pairing has played on all maps already generated?
2010-11-12T00:35:43  <janzert> I mean win or draw against perfect play :)
2010-11-12T00:35:46  <eburnette_> if it takes this much thought then it should be in there
2010-11-12T00:35:48  <Zannick> but there is no way to prevent bots from doing the exact same thing
2010-11-12T00:35:57  <antimatroid> and start with 1 map, then generate as needed?
2010-11-12T00:35:58  <janzert> i.e. against anyone
2010-11-12T00:36:10  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-12T00:36:32  <janzert> antimatroid: I'd rather not add that complexity
2010-11-12T00:36:34  <sigh> janzert: I'm 90% sure it will draw against perfect play
2010-11-12T00:36:38  <sigh> 99%
2010-11-12T00:36:54  <antimatroid> then we're going to need to work out a number of planets to be generated for the final contest
2010-11-12T00:37:05  <eburnette_> generate 100,000 maps and you won't have to worry about it antimatroid
2010-11-12T00:37:09  <antimatroid> i'd say too many will make results more unstable, but too few results in repeats
2010-11-12T00:37:34  <Zannick> just round-robin n times on n maps
2010-11-12T00:37:40  <antimatroid> you can't round robin
2010-11-12T00:37:47  <antimatroid> it's too inefficient
2010-11-12T00:38:06  <Zannick> :P
2010-11-12T00:38:17  <janzert> yeah, round-robin is a terribly inefficient use of games
2010-11-12T00:38:49  <antimatroid> i'd say 20-30 maps max
2010-11-12T00:38:56  <janzert> hmm, yeah I guess ideally we want as many maps as the largest number of pairings
2010-11-12T00:39:06  <janzert> repeat pairings
2010-11-12T00:39:17  <antimatroid> repeat pairings on a map are pointless
2010-11-12T00:39:26  <janzert> right
2010-11-12T00:39:33  <eburnette_> maybe
2010-11-12T00:39:36  <antimatroid> although can repeat starting positions i think
2010-11-12T00:39:46  <antimatroid> repeat with them switched*
2010-11-12T00:39:50  <sigh> yeah... I think you should actually work out estimates on paper to figure out the number of maps
2010-11-12T00:39:59  <eburnette_> there is a random factor due to timing
2010-11-12T00:40:07  <eburnette_> or use of random()
2010-11-12T00:40:09  <janzert> antimatroid: yeah, if necessary not as ideal as a different map though
2010-11-12T00:40:34  <antimatroid> would it be very hard for it to generate a new map every time a pairing requires it?
2010-11-12T00:40:41  <antimatroid> i think that'd be ideal
2010-11-12T00:41:04  <janzert> I would have to think about how hard that might be
2010-11-12T00:41:14  <Zannick> you'd have to keep track of the number of times a pairing occurs
2010-11-12T00:41:21  <janzert> remember new maps would have to be distributed to all the workers
2010-11-12T00:41:23  <antimatroid> already happening pretty sure
2010-11-12T00:41:37  <antimatroid> yeah, i have no idea how everything works :)
2010-11-12T00:41:40  <janzert> Zannick: the new pairing code does that
2010-11-12T00:41:49  <Zannick> janzert: ah, excellent
2010-11-12T00:41:57  <eburnette_> only probl is you could never repeat a battle (for understanding why the bot made a certain move)
2010-11-12T00:42:14  <antimatroid> i think that map generator is solid now
2010-11-12T00:42:19  <eburnette_> at least by map number anyway
2010-11-12T00:42:55  <sigh> why not have first pairing on map 1, second on map 2, etc?
2010-11-12T00:43:04  <sigh> or would that be less fair?
2010-11-12T00:43:39  <Zannick> that would heavily favor map 1 in initial rankings
2010-11-12T00:43:46  <janzert> antimatroid: mind making up a zip of say 20 maps from it and post it on the forums to try and get some feedback from players on them
2010-11-12T00:43:47  <antimatroid> sigh: that would do it
2010-11-12T00:43:53  <antimatroid> generate 200 maps, then do what sigh said
2010-11-12T00:44:03  <sigh> nah ,I think Zannick is right
2010-11-12T00:44:20  <Zannick> and you'd probably not get to all 200
2010-11-12T00:44:39  <janzert> yeah, you really need to randomly choose within the set of maps being used
2010-11-12T00:44:39  <antimatroid> yeah, i read that after
2010-11-12T00:45:08  <sigh> in that case, why do we want to restrict the maps to a small set?
2010-11-12T00:45:10  <janzert> which really means you want the initial set to be about the right size to start with and only grow if needed
2010-11-12T00:45:12  <sigh> why not 1000?
2010-11-12T00:45:21  <antimatroid> janzert: that sounds good though, increment usable maps when necessary, and pick between unused maps when paired
2010-11-12T00:45:24  <sigh> what is the advantage of a small set?
2010-11-12T00:45:26  <Zannick> yet in that case, you need to remember which maps you've used
2010-11-12T00:45:31  <antimatroid> start with like 20
2010-11-12T00:46:03  <antimatroid> sigh: i think it's better if lots of different bots play on the same map
2010-11-12T00:47:09  <sigh> playing devil's advocate, why is that better?
2010-11-12T00:48:10  <Zannick> better confidence in rankings
2010-11-12T00:48:29  <janzert> if you have a beats b beats c it's probably more likely a beats c if they both played the same map(s)
2010-11-12T00:48:47  <antimatroid> janzert: do you want me to post a link to the code in the forum post too?
2010-11-12T00:48:57  <sigh> hmm..fair enough
2010-11-12T00:48:58  <janzert> sure, then people can play with it
2010-11-12T00:49:37  <eburnette_> when you make the sample maps, give them new numbers, >1000
2010-11-12T00:50:06  <Zannick> map2k1.txt
2010-11-12T00:50:14  <antimatroid> eburnette_: what?
2010-11-12T00:50:14  <Zannick> heh
2010-11-12T00:50:19  <antimatroid> i've already made them, i'm uploading them now
2010-11-12T00:50:22  <Zannick> no, numbers are better, actually
2010-11-12T00:50:48  <eburnette_> I don't want them to be confused with the maps that already exist
2010-11-12T00:51:07  <antimatroid> wait, no i'm not

2010-11-12T01:11:36  <antimatroid> amstan: patience
2010-11-12T01:11:48  <janzert> I'm personally slightly worried about doing it at this stage
2010-11-12T01:11:50  <amstan> if they're valid maps i don't see why not
2010-11-12T01:12:08  <amstan> we constantly added maps last contest
2010-11-12T01:12:16  <antimatroid> eburnette_ for example had something in his code that depends on the old maps
2010-11-12T01:12:25  <janzert> amstan: because we are sort of changing the definition of valid here
2010-11-12T01:12:26  <antimatroid> but i think people shouldn't have assumed that anyway
2010-11-12T01:12:37  <mega1> I asked two weeks ago to pin down the generator
2010-11-12T01:12:43  <amstan> janzert: the only thing is different is the symmetry
2010-11-12T01:13:01  <antimatroid> mega1: i'm trying to pin it down now, do you not like these types of maps? any particular reason?
2010-11-12T01:13:12  <mega1> no, I like them
2010-11-12T01:13:34  <amstan> janzert: if there is a time to add maps to test things it's not
2010-11-12T01:13:35  <amstan> now*
2010-11-12T01:13:43  <mega1> what I don't much like is changing the generator two weeks before the end of a three month contest
2010-11-12T01:13:53  <janzert> hmm, I think it was 2 weeks ago :/

2010-11-12T01:14:19  <amstan> janzert: here..
2010-11-12T01:14:25  <amstan> janzert: we can add just one
2010-11-12T01:14:33  <amstan> how many maps are there in total
2010-11-12T01:14:37  <antimatroid> janzert: what about adding some of those 20 now, and seeing what happens?
2010-11-12T01:14:47  <amstan> i say yes
2010-11-12T01:14:50  <janzert> can we wait till tomorrow and see what the feedback is on the forums
2010-11-12T01:14:57  <antimatroid> yeah, that's probably good
2010-11-12T01:15:06  <janzert> removing them again is much harder than adding them
2010-11-12T01:15:24  <antimatroid> i don't think it's really changing the generator, when no generator had ever been set in stone
2010-11-12T01:15:28  <amstan> janzert: is it?
2010-11-12T01:15:31  <antimatroid> it's always been said that the old one wasn't intended to be used
2010-11-12T01:15:45  <antimatroid> amstan: rankings depend on the results
2010-11-12T01:15:56  <mega1> antimatroid: was it said?
2010-11-12T01:15:57  <janzert> yes, although adding them won't be completely trivial either :}
2010-11-12T01:15:59  <antimatroid> we need dhartmei to add some to tcp
2010-11-12T01:16:00  <amstan> janzert: the old games will still be there, yes, but taking maps out so no further people use them
2010-11-12T01:16:17  <antimatroid> mega1: j3camero has said it numerous times on here, but that's not really official i will admit
2010-11-12T01:16:40  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4447), george(4277), Raschi(4198), shangas(4194), asavis(4184), GreenTea(4155), dmj111(4125), oldman(4124), dimkadimon(4109), _Astek_(4093)
2010-11-12T01:16:52  <janzert> and tables in the database refer to them
2010-11-12T01:16:55  <amstan> j3camero is pretty spontaneous, he won't have much objections to this either
2010-11-12T01:17:10  <janzert> best not to really delete them at all but add the code to disable them really
2010-11-12T01:17:16  <antimatroid> i'm in favour of waiting for forum responses
2010-11-12T01:18:08  <janzert> if someone does decide to add them, remember to get them on all the workers and in svn for new workers before adding them to the database
2010-11-12T01:18:16  <janzert> otherwise it's going to be a real mess
2010-11-12T01:19:07  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has quit IRC ()
2010-11-12T01:19:51  <janzert> fyi, to answer a question I saw go by earlier, there are currently 100 maps in use
2010-11-12T01:22:39  <antimatroid> is it still just the 100 that came with starter packs?
2010-11-12T01:24:37  <janzert> I believe so
2010-11-12T01:24:44  <janzert> it's the 100 in svn
2010-11-12T01:25:01  <antimatroid> the first responded in the thread is under the impression that currently those 100 are intended to be the ones used
2010-11-12T01:25:20  <antimatroid> that would be the worst imo, it's meant to be an ai contest, not who can solve these 100 maps
2010-11-12T01:25:51  <antimatroid> at least i think that's what they meant
2010-11-12T01:25:53  <janzert> yeah, definitely the maps will be regenerated for the final
2010-11-12T01:26:44  <antimatroid> i think it's important all these decisions are made before the contest next time, which includes working out how to make maps properly
2010-11-12T01:27:44  <janzert> the only problem, well one anyway, is that a lot of these problems don't become evident until lots of people start pounding on them
2010-11-12T01:28:37  <antimatroid> yep, neutral resolution was a good one for that

2010-11-12T01:33:24  <antimatroid> codefun: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1087&p=7127#p7127
2010-11-12T01:34:14  <amstan> antimatroid: i would be interested to know what he meant by " People (such as myself) have written bots that are specifically geared to perform well on the current maps."
2010-11-12T01:34:27  <amstan> does he actually rely on the middle planet thing?
2010-11-12T01:34:36  <antimatroid> eburnette said he does
2010-11-12T01:34:42  <antimatroid> but not majorly
2010-11-12T01:34:57  <antimatroid> imo it's never been said that maps will meet that requirement
2010-11-12T01:35:04  <codefun> relying on specific settings = not good AI.
2010-11-12T01:35:05  <janzert> one common thing is simple code for splitting the map in two may break I suppose
2010-11-12T01:35:22  <antimatroid> you can still split the map in half though
2010-11-12T01:35:24  <janzert> and that seems to be a fairly common thing to be mentioned as first turn code on the forums
2010-11-12T01:35:36  <janzert> antimatroid: yeah, just the current code might break
2010-11-12T01:35:42  <antimatroid> the way i split it is unaffected by the change
2010-11-12T01:35:46  <janzert> but it shouldn't be a big deal
2010-11-12T01:35:47  <amstan> codefun: well.. no... it is good AI, like... you can only go so far..
2010-11-12T01:38:18  <amstan> antimatroid: point symmetric maps might be in the theme too, they do look like galaxies
2010-11-12T01:38:40  <antimatroid> point symmetric?
2010-11-12T01:38:54  <janzert> point, symmetric...
2010-11-12T01:40:37  <amstan> antimatroid: how they are now, i mean
2010-11-12T01:40:39  <codefun> Has anyone else thought of the fact the "radially symmetric" maps are just inversely bilaterally symmetric? Like you make one side, copy it, turn it upside down, then put it on the other side..?
2010-11-12T01:41:19  <antimatroid> codefun: i don't think you can do radially symmetric maps unless players are at angles 180 degrees apart
2010-11-12T01:42:02  <antimatroid> i was going to have the generator randomly switch between them but it doesn't work
2010-11-12T01:43:04  <amstan> codefun: yeah.. i'm not sure.. i'm split now
2010-11-12T01:43:26  <amstan> i was fine with introducing the linearly symmetric maps
2010-11-12T01:43:51  <amstan> till i saw that people were relying on the center planet thing: "players home planets were required to start in a position such that the line joining them intersected the center neutral planet."
2010-11-12T01:44:19  <mega1> we have spent two and a half months [unknowingly] optimizing for the old map generator
2010-11-12T01:44:22  <amstan> mega1: are you doing this?
2010-11-12T01:44:39  <mega1> do you really think it's a good idea to change it now?
2010-11-12T01:44:47  <mega1> amstan: no
2010-11-12T01:45:00  <amstan> mega1: well.. you said unknowingly
2010-11-12T01:45:01  <codefun> How can you unknowingly optimize for the exact same map configurations to be used?
2010-11-12T01:45:17  <mega1> for the _distribution_ of maps
2010-11-12T01:45:47  <amstan> So.. the rules do not state that we may not change maps, we could do it at any time. The problems with that is that we'll make a lot of people unhappy, and to what end?
2010-11-12T01:45:49  <codefun> I'm not sure I follow.
2010-11-12T01:46:05  <codefun> Well, I, for one, think switching up maps is great.
2010-11-12T01:46:22  <amstan> codefun: once you have different map types, you'll surely find some bugs that manifests only on the linear symmetric maps
2010-11-12T01:46:22  <mega1> codefun: do you have tunable parameters in your code?
2010-11-12T01:46:27  <codefun> It gives people a chance to see how their AI fares in the big bad world of uncertainties.
2010-11-12T01:47:23  <antimatroid> amstan: jeff gave me the idea of these maps
2010-11-12T01:47:24  <mega1> codefun: did you throw away certain changes or approaches because they didn't perform well enough?
2010-11-12T01:47:40  <amstan> antimatroid: oh man.. he'll definitely put them in then
2010-11-12T01:47:59  <mega1> well, the maps that you tested on were the current ones
2010-11-12T01:48:27  <mega1> everyone has burned weeks of cpu power testing ideas
2010-11-12T01:48:49  <mega1> changing the maps late invalidates much of that effort.
2010-11-12T01:49:19  <antimatroid> mega1: starting maps have always just been examples
2010-11-12T01:49:29  <mega1> I the generator is changed I have to put trying new developments on hold and repeat testing.
2010-11-12T01:49:31  <antimatroid> i have always been under that understanding, both for this and tron
2010-11-12T01:49:39  <antimatroid> tron has significantly different maps added at the end
2010-11-12T01:49:48  <amstan> antimatroid: just in terms of size
2010-11-12T01:50:00  <antimatroid> amstan: and obstables
2010-11-12T01:50:01  <mega1> antimatroid: that's was unfair for the same reason
2010-11-12T01:50:15  <amstan> antimatroid: we didn't have those change, just size
2010-11-12T01:50:40  <antimatroid> i think a size change is worse
2010-11-12T01:50:55  <mega1> antimatroid: for an optimization task moving the target is a strange thing to do
2010-11-12T01:50:58  <codefun> size change would make battles a bit... drawn out and strange
2010-11-12T01:51:24  <mega1> and the target is a distribution of maps (i.e. what the generator produces)
2010-11-12T01:51:46  <antimatroid> i prefer the greater level of generality
2010-11-12T01:51:55  <codefun> larger maps means more calculations which means that actually could cause our bots to crash due to time constraints
2010-11-12T01:52:00  <antimatroid> and i don't think anyones code is going to break in such a way that can't easily be fixed
2010-11-12T01:52:03  <mega1> the 900 hundred sample maps that I used for testing should be a pretty good sample
2010-11-12T01:52:27  <amstan> antimatroid: i see mega's pov, he spent tons of time testing and optimizing his code
2010-11-12T01:52:38  <antimatroid> on an assumption he made
2010-11-12T01:52:51  <codefun> anti, I think changing map design/configuration/symmetry is fine, personally
2010-11-12T01:52:53  <mega1> of course, I have the most invested in the current status quo
2010-11-12T01:53:03  <amstan> antimatroid: how would you of done it then?
2010-11-12T01:53:05  <codefun> If my AI fails because of map configuration I must've failed in making an intelligent machine
2010-11-12T01:53:14  <antimatroid> i'd be surprised of your bot wasn't still far superior on these maps
2010-11-12T01:53:15  <mega1> but we all have optimized for that generator
2010-11-12T01:53:34  <mega1> antimatroid: that's not really the point
2010-11-12T01:53:35  <amstan> mega1: k.. so like..
2010-11-12T01:53:37  <amstan> try it!
2010-11-12T01:53:50  <antimatroid> codefun: not entirely true, what happens if i thow your both in a 10-dimensional 4 player gmae?
2010-11-12T01:54:14  <antimatroid> amstan: i write my bot to be as general as possible inside teh rules that have been given
2010-11-12T01:54:33  <amstan> antimatroid: ok.. sounds good\
2010-11-12T01:54:40  <mega1> antimatroid: does it perform equally well for every map generator within those rules?
2010-11-12T01:55:09  <antimatroid> i would expect it to be as random as the maps generated under either generator
2010-11-12T01:55:21  <mega1> have you tested and discarded changes during the last two months?
2010-11-12T01:55:23  <antimatroid> i have nothing about forcing that symmetry
2010-11-12T01:55:41  <antimatroid> and on the same side, i could argue that i would have spent more time thinking under that restriction if it were in stone
2010-11-12T01:55:51  <antimatroid> so i'm at a disadvantage to those who made an assumption
2010-11-12T01:55:58  <amstan> oh man.. this is exactly what happened last year with accoun
2010-11-12T01:56:00  <antimatroid> although i probably wouldn't have
2010-11-12T01:56:06  <amstan> he just died when he heard we'll have smaller maps
2010-11-12T01:56:55  <antimatroid> so arguing one is disadvantaged from an assumption they made is an invalid argument imo, because the same holds for those who didn't make the assumption and then have that forced on them
2010-11-12T01:57:11  <codefun> Too much bureaucracy! Make a command decision and stick with it.
2010-11-12T01:57:20  <mega1> antimatroid: it can easily be that among the versions you discarded as bad, there was a true gem
2010-11-12T01:57:32  <codefun> There will be some who like it and some who don't, no matter what you do, and they'll both have the same arguments.
2010-11-12T01:57:40  <amstan> so the thing is... these different maps make the games more interesting, it's under the rules, and if you optimized your bot for the first map generator you made a gamble
2010-11-12T01:58:25  <antimatroid> i don't think many people really will have optimised with that restriction anyway
2010-11-12T01:58:33  <mega1> right, and you can also make bigger changes if you want to shuffle ranking around ... which I don't :-)
2010-11-12T01:58:47  <amstan> antimatroid: they probably all do, because they used the default map generator
2010-11-12T01:59:12  <amstan> i don't think anyone modified the map generator to produce other maps such as different number of planets or changes to the symmetry
2010-11-12T01:59:21  <antimatroid> given the current rankings are based off the first 100 maps atm, i'd say the rankings are terrible atm
2010-11-12T01:59:32  <antimatroid> because a lot of peoples bots can just be running strategies they already created on there
2010-11-12T01:59:39  <antimatroid> although i doubt many are

2010-11-12T02:07:58  <antimatroid> shouldn't people be able to vote for that exclusively if you are going to do a poll?
2010-11-12T02:09:04  <amstan> antimatroid: point symmetric was the old one
2010-11-12T02:10:27  <antimatroid> okay, cool
2010-11-12T02:10:41  <antimatroid> the generator i wrote will need to be altered to do both kinds of maps
2010-11-12T02:11:02  <amstan> antimatroid: should be fairly easy
2010-11-12T02:11:07  <amstan> antimatroid: can i have a link to the code?
2010-11-12T02:11:08  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/JuoNVCba
2010-11-12T02:11:16  <antimatroid> bam, i was just on my way to provide it :P
2010-11-12T02:11:45  <antimatroid> i had never done anything in python before that, so don't be too harsh on the coding style
2010-11-12T02:12:06  <antimatroid> i didn't even realise i could just run the file without compiling, mind blown
2010-11-12T02:12:48  <codefun> you must learn the ways of scripting... ;)
2010-11-12T02:12:52  <amstan> antimatroid: where's the symmetry stuff
2010-11-12T02:13:35  <antimatroid> amstan: it picks radius and rotation angles randomly then generates coordinates based off of those
2010-11-12T02:13:48  <amstan> antimatroid: ugh.. yeah.. you need a total redesign then
2010-11-12T02:14:06  <antimatroid> why?
2010-11-12T02:14:06  <amstan> antimatroid: what i did for tron was.. i generated the top half, picked a starting point
2010-11-12T02:14:25  <amstan> then.. for point symmetry i would copy that top part, mirror X and Y and put it under
2010-11-12T02:14:32  <amstan> for line symmetry just mirror X

2010-11-12T02:15:03  <amstan> oh man!
2010-11-12T02:15:06  <amstan> epic kind of maps
2010-11-12T02:15:09  <amstan> make 2 galaxies
2010-11-12T02:15:12  <amstan> far from eachother
2010-11-12T02:15:19  <amstan> put a player in each galaxy
2010-11-12T02:15:23  <antimatroid> that's just a race to expand
2010-11-12T02:15:28  <amstan> make the galaxies so far that yeah...
2010-11-12T02:15:30  <antimatroid> that's hardly even a game
2010-11-12T02:15:36  <amstan> so.. the winner will be the one that expands the best
2010-11-12T02:15:52  <antimatroid> that's more of who is best at a decision problem than a game
2010-11-12T02:15:57  <amstan> i did a test with those maps for tron, they were isolated from eachother, it was who survives the most in the maze
2010-11-12T02:16:02  <antimatroid> in that my decisions don't affect the other player
2010-11-12T02:16:21  <antimatroid> like mario ai, that's not a game
2010-11-12T02:16:25  <amstan> i see
2010-11-12T02:16:25  <antimatroid> it's a decision problem

2010-11-12T02:18:38  <contestbot> amstan: OK
2010-11-12T02:20:12  <amstan> janzert: oh yeah.. there's a guy complaining about clojure support
2010-11-12T02:23:09  <janzert> hmm
2010-11-12T02:24:31  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm going to buy some dinner
2010-11-12T02:25:53  <amstan> janzert: what do you think of "Number of planets is not stated in the rules, and it might change, (assume 100 if you really want a top limit)."
2010-11-12T02:26:34  <antimatroid> i'm against changing it from 23
2010-11-12T02:26:39  <antimatroid> although i could personally handle it
2010-11-12T02:26:40  <amstan> antimatroid: why?
2010-11-12T02:27:00  <antimatroid> if you make it much past 30 you will cripple a significant portion of the bots
2010-11-12T02:27:08  <antimatroid> and a fix wont be easy without completely changing strategies
2010-11-12T02:27:37  <amstan> antimatroid: but again.. this is exactly the same problem as the linear symmetry
2010-11-12T02:28:06  <antimatroid> it is, like i said before, these kind of things need to be worked out before the contest even starts if possible
2010-11-12T02:28:18  <antimatroid> varying around below 30 would be fine
2010-11-12T02:28:35  <antimatroid> but if you go above that, you're going to really render a lot of the top bots useless
2010-11-12T02:28:42  <amstan> antimatroid: that sounds good
2010-11-12T02:28:46  <amstan> so.. s/100/30
2010-11-12T02:28:59  <amstan> i just think it's really stupid to have a constant number of planets
2010-11-12T02:29:10  <antimatroid> i don't think it really matters
2010-11-12T02:29:16  <antimatroid> strategy wise
2010-11-12T02:30:31  <antimatroid> one option is to randomly decide whether to include the centre neutral planet or not
2010-11-12T02:30:57  <janzert> amstan: yeah moving it up is likely to break any bots using bitmasks for planets
2010-11-12T02:31:08  <amstan> i think the number of planets should be in the [15:30] range
2010-11-12T02:31:23  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be opposed to [3,30]
2010-11-12T02:31:28  <amstan> sure..
2010-11-12T02:31:38  <antimatroid> but a lot of people would
2010-11-12T02:31:47  <antimatroid> i always wanted 3 planets, but i think i was the only one
2010-11-12T02:31:59  <antimatroid> a lot of people wouldn't****
2010-11-12T02:32:50  <antimatroid> hang on, i have a good idea for even more general maps, i'll draw a pic
2010-11-12T02:35:02  <antimatroid> http://imgur.com/N2LzL.png
2010-11-12T02:35:16  <amstan> antimatroid: that's line symmetric
2010-11-12T02:35:17  <antimatroid> you can pick any number of neutrals to go along that yellow line, and only have to put one of them in
2010-11-12T02:35:40  <antimatroid> yes, but it's adding more planets starting equal distance between players
2010-11-12T02:36:00  <amstan> won't cause RPS?
2010-11-12T02:36:12  <antimatroid> the idea is to have the other ones as well
2010-11-12T02:36:13  <janzert> that would be good :)
2010-11-12T02:36:28  <amstan> janzert: do we still have the priority column for the maps?
2010-11-12T02:36:39  <janzert> yes, but it's currently unused

2010-11-12T02:36:42  <antimatroid> generate players starting positions, generate random number of single neutrals, then fill the rest with two symmetrically placed neutrals
2010-11-12T02:36:51  <amstan> janzert: as in.. the code ignores it?
2010-11-12T02:37:06  <janzert> yeah, the code doesn't reference it anywhere that I have seen
2010-11-12T02:37:14  <amstan> that's not cool
2010-11-12T02:37:19  <amstan> that's how we disabled maps last term
2010-11-12T02:37:23  <janzert> and certainly the rewrite of pairing code I just did doesn't
2010-11-12T02:37:23  <amstan> set priority to 0
2010-11-12T02:37:29  <janzert> yep
2010-11-12T02:38:19  <janzert> after I remembered seeing that the column was there adding it's use back in shouldn't be too hard
2010-11-12T02:38:56  <janzert> in fact I think now that's how we should disable the current maps for the final
2010-11-12T02:39:03  <antimatroid> alright, i'm going to change it to randomly pick number of planets and number of middle neutrals
2010-11-12T02:39:09  <janzert> just set all of them to 0 then generate the new maps
2010-11-12T02:39:10  <amstan> janzert: k.. so we have that solved then
2010-11-12T02:39:23  <janzert> well, theoretically :)
2010-11-12T02:39:32  <janzert> still need to write the code of course

2010-11-12T02:40:20  <antimatroid> i wouldn't have a clue how to do that sorry
2010-11-12T02:41:15  <antimatroid> i'm not willing to do anything or get any access to anything that renders me inelligible of competing though

2010-11-12T02:47:58  <antimatroid> now, if one was to use both symmetries, what sort of split would you like the maps to be?
2010-11-12T02:47:59  <antimatroid> 50 50?
2010-11-12T02:48:33  <antimatroid> i think it'd be best to just make the one generator generate all maps

2010-11-12T03:07:18  <amstan> as in the biggest horizontal or vertical distance between planets
2010-11-12T03:11:32  <antimatroid> i think people are happy with a map radius of 12
2010-11-12T03:11:48  <amstan> oh..
2010-11-12T03:11:50  <antimatroid> i have it switching between symmetries
2010-11-12T03:12:00  <amstan> so.. 10,20?
2010-11-12T03:12:02  <amstan> how's that?
2010-11-12T03:12:02  <antimatroid> just going to add variable number of planets and "central" planets

2010-11-12T03:12:16  <amstan> 10-20
2010-11-12T03:12:16  <antimatroid> map radius?
2010-11-12T03:12:19  <amstan> could be variable
2010-11-12T03:12:22  <amstan> it's not exactly radius
2010-11-12T03:12:24  <amstan> it's size
2010-11-12T03:12:39  <antimatroid> i say just leave it at 12 max, then it doesn't necessarily reach that distance anyway
2010-11-12T03:12:44  <antimatroid> so max distance is 24
2010-11-12T03:13:25  <amstan> antimatroid: i'm creating X and Y values based on random.uniform(10,15)
2010-11-12T03:13:47  <antimatroid> i'm geneating radius and theta values randomly, then converting to cartesian coordinates
2010-11-12T03:13:53  <antimatroid> so it's made inside a cirlce
2010-11-12T03:14:03  <amstan> i'm making another map gen
2010-11-12T03:14:06  <antimatroid> it makes doing the new symmetry much easier

2010-11-12T04:11:11  <antimatroid> that's function overloading
2010-11-12T04:11:13  <antimatroid> my bad

2010-11-12T04:26:05  <mega1> is it possible to change votes?
2010-11-12T04:26:37  <antimatroid> mega1: yes, i just did

2010-11-12T04:27:05  <amstan> mega1: ya, i made it changable
2010-11-12T04:27:26  <antimatroid> i take it that was from seeing my change and not a change of heart? :P
2010-11-12T04:27:45  <amstan> antimatroid: what was?
2010-11-12T04:27:46  <mega1> not of mine :-)
2010-11-12T04:27:59  <antimatroid> amstan: i changed my vote from both to wild
2010-11-12T04:28:07  <amstan> mega1: and you?
2010-11-12T04:28:13  <antimatroid> saw my change
2010-11-12T04:28:17  <antimatroid> and wondered how poll number dropped
2010-11-12T04:28:22  <mega1> yup
2010-11-12T04:28:34  <amstan> mega1: what did you vote for?
2010-11-12T04:28:54  <mega1> amstan: the "stay where you are" option
2010-11-12T04:28:58  <amstan> ok
2010-11-12T04:29:42  <amstan> but line symmetry is so much cooler than point symmetry!
2010-11-12T04:30:03  <antimatroid> mega1 made assumptions about maps being like that and "threw out ideas based on that"
2010-11-12T04:30:36  <amstan> like.. why would you throw out an idea just because current maps are like that?
2010-11-12T04:30:52  <amstan> the least you can do is ask
2010-11-12T04:31:01  <antimatroid> he did
2010-11-12T04:31:01  <amstan> wait.. maybe you did
2010-11-12T04:31:04  <amstan> darn
2010-11-12T04:31:07  <mega1> I made the assumption that the strength a bot displays is closely related to its playing strength in the final tournament
2010-11-12T04:31:22  <antimatroid> i don't think the rankings will change much at all
2010-11-12T04:31:28  <amstan> mega1: how sure are you that changing it to line symmetric too will break your bot?
2010-11-12T04:31:41  <amstan> antimatroid: i don't think either
2010-11-12T04:31:43  <antimatroid> is it possible to run some of the top bots on new maps separately and see if the rankings remain much the same?
2010-11-12T04:31:56  <antimatroid> my intentions are not to mix up the rankings at all
2010-11-12T04:32:04  <amstan> antimatroid: not really, code's kinda crappy, so it's inflexible at doing these things
2010-11-12T04:32:17  <mega1> I don't know if this change will change anything which is precisely the reason for not doing it.
2010-11-12T04:32:18  <amstan> antimatroid: and running them without a sandbox is not a cool idea either
2010-11-12T04:32:36  <antimatroid> what we need is some of the maps on tcp
2010-11-12T04:32:59  <mega1> I have played about 20000 games locally so far.
2010-11-12T04:33:27  <mega1> testing countless changes
2010-11-12T04:33:43  <amstan> anyone know grep?
2010-11-12T04:33:58  <amstan> nvm
2010-11-12T04:34:09  <antimatroid> mega1: you were welcome to create your own test maps
2010-11-12T04:34:21  <antimatroid> the same was said for tron, don't assume maps are going to be like those provided
2010-11-12T04:34:54  <mega1> antimatroid: I'm still not talking about the maps but the generator.
2010-11-12T04:35:32  <amstan> mega1: you're welcome to create your own generator
2010-11-12T04:35:47  <mega1> are or were?
2010-11-12T04:35:54  <amstan> still are
2010-11-12T04:35:58  <antimatroid> mega1: that's my point, there has never been a specified "official generator for the contest"
2010-11-12T04:36:00  <mega1> and it's just too late
2010-11-12T04:36:15  <antimatroid> an example genreator and example genrated maps were provided
2010-11-12T04:36:17  <mega1> guys, the lawyer stance is just not useful
2010-11-12T04:36:27  <amstan> mega1: the point is that you should have thought about this, other people did
2010-11-12T04:36:42  <mega1> I did and asked on the mailing list.
2010-11-12T04:37:03  <amstan> k, hold on
2010-11-12T04:37:17  <amstan> mega1: what email did you use as?
2010-11-12T04:37:25  <mega1> mega@retes.hu
2010-11-12T04:37:31  <amstan> darn
2010-11-12T04:37:33  <amstan> k
2010-11-12T04:38:17  <amstan> mega1: wait, you sure? do you have a subject name, i can't find your actual email address
2010-11-12T04:38:32  <antimatroid> yes, i'm looking at it now
2010-11-12T04:38:37  <amstan> antimatroid: link?
2010-11-12T04:38:42  <antimatroid> it's in my email :P
2010-11-12T04:38:49  <amstan> antimatroid: subject line?
2010-11-12T04:38:58  <antimatroid> DECISION TIME
2010-11-12T04:39:01  <antimatroid> second last
2010-11-12T04:39:02  <mega1> yes
2010-11-12T04:39:39  <amstan> it's melis.*
2010-11-12T04:40:32  <amstan> mega1: you didn't get a reply though
2010-11-12T04:40:41  <antimatroid> that's his point
2010-11-12T04:41:11  <antimatroid> yes, no response doesn't mean the generator there is official, but then the point moves onto it being really late in the contest
2010-11-12T04:41:30  <antimatroid> but i've been going under the assumption the whole time that maps could change, and my understanding of the rules was to expect that
2010-11-12T04:41:47  <mega1> yes, the maps
2010-11-12T04:42:25  <mega1> but if the generator too then you have to think and lay down some guidelines
2010-11-12T04:42:27  <antimatroid> it's a situation where there is no solution that doesn't in a way disadvantage someone, that's why these decisions need to be made (where possible) before the contest even starts
2010-11-12T04:42:36  <mega1> yes
2010-11-12T04:44:04  <antimatroid> my point is that it shouldn't give any particular person an unfair advantage with the new maps, whether optimising on old ones or not, the new maps are way cooler and the rules always had this open to be done
2010-11-12T04:44:51  <antimatroid> and it does give an advantage to people who made assumptions and have spent considerable time working under those assumptions to then have them enforced
2010-11-12T04:46:07  <amstan> so..
2010-11-12T04:46:23  <amstan> i did say "just changing the seed": http://pastebin.com/r2nRuc9u
2010-11-12T04:46:51  <antimatroid> amstan: "You should not train your bots on the current maps." should read "You should not train your bots exclusively on the current maps."
2010-11-12T04:47:27  <antimatroid> there is nothing wrong with training bots on current maps, but they were only ever given as examples
2010-11-12T04:47:42  <amstan> antimatroid: yeah, lol
2010-11-12T04:47:44  <amstan> antimatroid: thanks
2010-11-12T04:48:14  <antimatroid> i'm going to get back to work on the new bot anyway, it's not going to write itself
2010-11-12T04:50:01  <mega1> I also asked about whether server #0 is going to be in the finals
2010-11-12T04:50:15  <mega1> because it's way slower than the others
2010-11-12T04:50:33  <mega1> and the amount of ram one can expect to have without being forced to swap and time out.
2010-11-12T04:50:34  <antimatroid> mega1: jeff seemed to think the servers were going a lot better now
2010-11-12T04:50:40  <antimatroid> it was getting 90 games a minute before
2010-11-12T04:50:46  <antimatroid> but not sure about your specific question
2010-11-12T04:51:13  <antimatroid> it isn't that good anymore, hmmm
2010-11-12T04:52:39  <antimatroid> there's a new australian in the top 50

2010-11-12T05:40:30  <Naktibalda> you have to hope that your bot doesn't suck at it :)

2010-11-12T05:41:01  <antimatroid> that's what a map would look like with many "central" neutral planets
2010-11-12T05:41:04  <antimatroid> and a cock and balls theme
2010-11-12T05:48:35  <Error323_> http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php woooooooow it's blaaazing
2010-11-12T05:49:24  <Error323_> antimatroid: how is that symmetrical?
2010-11-12T05:49:55  <amstan> Error323_: it is, it's just scaled annoyingly for some reason
2010-11-12T05:50:18  <amstan> Error323_: it's symmetric about that line of planets
2010-11-12T05:50:29  <antimatroid> yeah, it is symmetrical, i have a seprate file i can check symmetry of a map on and I have counted turns in jbotmanager
2010-11-12T05:50:30  <Error323_> ah ok
2010-11-12T05:50:46  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/5A5vJQuD
2010-11-12T05:50:51  <antimatroid> try generating yourself some maps on that page
2010-11-12T05:51:04  <antimatroid> it'll give you alternating symmetries and multiple "central" neutral planets
2010-11-12T05:53:20  <antimatroid> oh, and varying number of planets
2010-11-12T05:54:16  <Error323_> ah
2010-11-12T05:54:25  <Error323_> those are excellent given my bot's workings :P
2010-11-12T05:54:57  <antimatroid> Error323_: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1087&start=20
2010-11-12T05:55:08  <antimatroid> there is a poll on peoples preferences about using new maps like these in the final contest
2010-11-12T05:58:24  <mega1> Error323_: make sure you read the discussion too :-)
2010-11-12T05:58:28  <antimatroid> wait, i'm not sure the game stays symmetric when radially symmetric if i put "centre" neutrals off dead centre
2010-11-12T06:00:54  <Error323_> mega1: yeah imo its too late aswell
2010-11-12T06:01:22  <antimatroid> it's always been intended for them to change though
2010-11-12T06:01:34  <antimatroid> people were told not to assume the starting maps are a good representation of all maps
2010-11-12T06:01:52  <antimatroid> i think people missed that memo
2010-11-12T06:02:01  <antimatroid> it was touted throughout tron
2010-11-12T06:02:05  <antimatroid> and i've seen it said for this
2010-11-12T06:03:31  <Error323_> well
2010-11-12T06:03:58  <Error323_> even if it was said it would still be very misleading to let the unofficial ranking server never ever play those maps
2010-11-12T06:04:32  <mega1> Error323_: have you voted yet? ;-)
2010-11-12T06:05:10  <Error323_> yes
2010-11-12T06:06:02  <antimatroid> Error323_: i think it's unfair to let people who made assumptions get to have those maps exclusively
2010-11-12T06:06:13  <antimatroid> anyone who didn't make any assumptions shouldn't be disadvantaged
2010-11-12T06:06:59  <antimatroid> i haven't made any assumptions for that reason, cause it'd suck if things changed
2010-11-12T06:07:04  <antimatroid> but it's always been said that they would
2010-11-12T06:07:16  <antimatroid> it's unfair to then just leave it imo
2010-11-12T06:07:30  <antimatroid> more unfair*

2010-11-12T06:15:00  <antimatroid> there is no bot for bocsimacko
2010-11-12T06:15:15  <antimatroid> mega1: did you mean to take your bot down?
2010-11-12T06:16:03  <antimatroid> wait, nevermind
2010-11-12T06:16:11  <antimatroid> i don't know why it didn't show up under "lisp" bots

2010-11-12T06:18:04  <mega1> antimatroid: just reuploaded
2010-11-12T06:18:25  <antimatroid> yep, i didn't think i'd have noticed in the time it took to show up
2010-11-12T06:18:48  <mega1> Error323: is that the alpha beta bot?
2010-11-12T06:18:55  <antimatroid> it got to 12th pretty quick
2010-11-12T06:18:57  <antimatroid> one game
2010-11-12T06:19:05  <Error323> mega1: nah, the alphabeta bot sux
2010-11-12T06:19:09  <mega1> ouch
2010-11-12T06:19:14  <Error323> yeeeeeep
2010-11-12T06:19:31  <Error323> wasted about 1.5 weeks of codetime on that :/
2010-11-12T06:19:46  <antimatroid> i wasted so much time on minimax and zero sum simultaneous games
2010-11-12T06:19:48  <mega1> I did play with alpha beta and nash too
2010-11-12T06:20:41  <antimatroid> i'm in the process of writing a complete final revision to try and get rid of bugs and rid myself of terrible hacks i made previously
2010-11-12T06:21:00  <Error323> i just don't know a good eval function
2010-11-12T06:21:28  <Error323> thats not a very precisely tweaked heuristic thing
2010-11-12T06:21:40  <Error323> which would take another 2 weeks to get right
2010-11-12T06:22:03  <Error323> i want awesomeness in a linear function :P
2010-11-12T06:22:05  <Error323> heh
2010-11-12T06:22:21  <Error323> or through non manual tweaking anyway

2010-11-12T06:33:59  <aerique> at least it's over quick :)
2010-11-12T06:34:03  <Error323> ah still there
2010-11-12T06:34:07  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-12T06:34:40  <Error323> i'm so curious as to what your heuristic eval function is
2010-11-12T06:34:53  <mega1> I think the rating calc is lagging a bit.
2010-11-12T06:35:19  <mega1> Error323: that should be a good topic for a short blog post
2010-11-12T06:35:45  <antimatroid> i do hope nobody beats mega1 (unless it's me), he's been on top so long now
2010-11-12T06:36:05  <mega1> george worries me still
2010-11-12T06:36:12  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-12T06:36:14  <antimatroid> yeah, i saw his bot earlier
2010-11-12T06:36:19  <mega1> he has an old bot on the official server
2010-11-12T06:36:28  <antimatroid> that;s more worrying
2010-11-12T06:36:34  <antimatroid> last time i had a running bot i beat him 2 for 1
2010-11-12T06:36:38  <antimatroid> but that was probably pure luck
2010-11-12T06:36:42  <mega1> and on tcp he was getting very near to the top when he took his bots down
2010-11-12T06:37:03  <antimatroid> perhaps he had the eureka moment :P
2010-11-12T06:37:09  <antimatroid> and isn't releasing until final tourny now
2010-11-12T06:37:57  <Error323> mega1: yes blogging that would be really cool
2010-11-12T06:38:19  <mega1> unfortunately I'll only have time to blog on the 28th :-)
2010-11-12T06:38:24  <antimatroid> hehe
2010-11-12T06:38:51  <Error323> mega1: how so?
2010-11-12T06:39:03  <mega1> I'm so busy writing code
2010-11-12T06:39:25  <Error323> still?
2010-11-12T06:39:25  <antimatroid> Error323: tthat wasn't self explanatory?
2010-11-12T06:39:36  <antimatroid> one could program for a few years on this problem
2010-11-12T06:39:52  <Error323> no i mean why not 29th, 30th et
2010-11-12T06:39:54  <Error323> etc
2010-11-12T06:39:55  <Error323> +)
2010-11-12T06:40:11  <mega1> because the contest ends on the 27th?
2010-11-12T06:40:39  <antimatroid> i'm putting my final bot up a good day before deadline
2010-11-12T06:41:00  <Error323> mega1: yeah i know, so you can blog afterwards right =)
2010-11-12T06:41:05  <Error323> doesn't have to be just 28th
2010-11-12T06:41:27  <antimatroid> give him a break, english is his second language
2010-11-12T06:41:51  <Error323> hmm it seems i'm being misunderstood
2010-11-12T06:42:00  <antimatroid> i understand
2010-11-12T06:42:12  <antimatroid> he meant that he wont be blogging until at least then
2010-11-12T06:42:18  <Error323> got nothing but respect for the man ;)
2010-11-12T06:42:53  <antimatroid> i think everyone is in awe

2010-11-12T06:43:05  <antimatroid> nobody managed that last time

2010-11-12T06:56:37  <antimatroid> i take it you've both heard that one?

2010-11-12T06:57:06  <Error323> or sth
2010-11-12T06:57:18  <antimatroid> yeah aha

2010-11-12T06:58:43  <mega1> Error323: they were involved in putting down the hungarian revolution (1844-1848) against the austrians
2010-11-12T06:58:43  <Error323> mega1: lol, how do you test your bots when you win of everyone but yourself :P must be a real problem for you
2010-11-12T06:58:55  <Error323> mega1: ahhh lol
2010-11-12T06:59:25  <mega1> it takes many games to get info on tcp
2010-11-12T06:59:42  <mega1> and even then I'm mostly counting number of losses
2010-11-12T06:59:50  <mega1> to compare versions. Oh, and timeouts.
2010-11-12T06:59:50  <Error323> yeah...
2010-11-12T06:59:57  <Error323> still its very tricky
2010-11-12T07:00:15  <Error323> i assume you first play against eachother locally
2010-11-12T07:00:52  <mega1> yes, and a couple of times lost 100+ elos with a change that was quite a bit better against its old self
2010-11-12T07:01:16  <Error323> yeah but you can't play them against eachother on tcp
2010-11-12T07:01:27  <mega1> can, but don't want to
2010-11-12T07:01:30  <Error323> that would seriously bias the results as they would be picked against eachother quite a lot
2010-11-12T07:01:35  <mega1> yes
2010-11-12T07:02:09  <mega1> that's the trouble Accoun has with running several versions at the same time
2010-11-12T07:03:37  <Error323> i think your only good testbed is the official
2010-11-12T07:03:55  <Error323> tcp is too unstable in terms of connections/players
2010-11-12T07:04:34  <mega1> true, on the other hand you play a whole lot more games
2010-11-12T07:05:28  <Error323> mega1: are you running linux by any chance?
2010-11-12T07:05:40  <mega1> Error323: yes
2010-11-12T07:05:57  <mega1> you don't want a binary, right? ;-)
2010-11-12T07:06:59  <Error323> no :P
2010-11-12T07:07:13  <Error323> i want you to have mine :P
2010-11-12T07:07:38  <Error323> just curiuos :P
2010-11-12T07:14:25  <antimatroid> remember official site still only has the original 100 maps
2010-11-12T07:14:42  <antimatroid> i don't think that is a good indication of possible maps, even with the original generator

2010-11-12T07:17:53  <Error323> is the servercode using old rank as startrank nowadays?
2010-11-12T07:18:22  <antimatroid> i think it might be
2010-11-12T07:18:32  <antimatroid> but only based off watching your bots go up the ranks
2010-11-12T07:20:47  <mega1> I think it makes a lot of sense to bias opponent selection this way

2010-11-12T07:25:53  <phreeza> your heuristic bot that you are rewriting?
2010-11-12T07:28:07  <antimatroid> yep, i've given up on modeling the other player too
2010-11-12T07:28:10  <antimatroid> it's too expensive

2010-11-12T07:30:14  <phreeza> yea i guess thats the only thing that makes sense in this context :P
2010-11-12T07:30:29  <antimatroid> have you taken a look at the new maps i generated?

2010-11-12T07:34:54  <antimatroid> no, i have a new generator
2010-11-12T07:34:57  <antimatroid> does more symmetrie
2010-11-12T07:35:01  <antimatroid> and more general maps

2010-11-12T07:35:26  <phreeza> ah i see
2010-11-12T07:35:30  <antimatroid> it will always be the case that a fresh set of maps is generated for the final contest
2010-11-12T07:36:03  <phreeza> yea i'm cool with that
2010-11-12T07:36:17  <antimatroid> i'm incredibly biased
2010-11-12T07:36:21  <phreeza> but changing the symmetries seems a bit harsh
2010-11-12T07:36:32  <antimatroid> no it doesn't, people shouldn't make assumptions
2010-11-12T07:36:50  <Error323> lol
2010-11-12T07:36:50  <antimatroid> it's harsh to allow people who made assumptions to have had that extra time working under that constraint
2010-11-12T07:36:52  <phreeza> i think even people who didn't explicitly make that assumption tweaked their bots on these maps
2010-11-12T07:36:55  <Error323> antimatroid: yes they should
2010-11-12T07:37:15  <Error323> you can't let the official run the same type of maps for 80% of the contest time
2010-11-12T07:37:23  <Error323> and then suddenly change everything
2010-11-12T07:37:32  <antimatroid> the maps were provided only as an example
2010-11-12T07:37:44  <antimatroid> it was always stated they are not to be used as an exhaustive testing set
2010-11-12T07:37:47  <antimatroid> not even the generator
2010-11-12T07:37:49  <Error323> but its all the contestants got..
2010-11-12T07:37:54  <antimatroid> make your own
2010-11-12T07:37:57  <antimatroid> it's not that difficult
2010-11-12T07:38:03  <Error323> no i mean...
2010-11-12T07:38:04  <antimatroid> i've made a couple of different generators
2010-11-12T07:38:08  <phreeza> the space is so huge....
2010-11-12T07:38:08  <antimatroid> and plenty of small maps
2010-11-12T07:38:14  <antimatroid> testing out lots of general cases
2010-11-12T07:38:29  <Error323> the contestants need other opponents and they can't get hands on the binaries of other players so all they got is official
2010-11-12T07:38:32  <antimatroid> i did that under the specified rules
2010-11-12T07:38:37  <phreeza> if the symmetries can be changed, whos to say the size of the planets isn't
2010-11-12T07:38:41  <phreeza> or the number
2010-11-12T07:38:48  <antimatroid> now it's basically saying, people who made assumptions get to hold them and have had that extra time working with that
2010-11-12T07:39:09  <antimatroid> phreeza: one option and generator switched between symmetries and number of planets etc.
2010-11-12T07:39:14  <antimatroid> switches*
2010-11-12T07:39:19  <antimatroid> i am actually in favour of that one
2010-11-12T07:40:01  <antimatroid> also, with bilateral symmetry, you can have multiple neutrals starting at an equal distance from both players
2010-11-12T07:40:08  <antimatroid> rather than just the central planet
2010-11-12T07:40:42  <phreeza> you can have that now too
2010-11-12T07:40:42  <antimatroid> and the maps are way cooler
2010-11-12T07:40:46  <antimatroid> no you can't
2010-11-12T07:40:48  <phreeza> because of the ceil
2010-11-12T07:41:00  <antimatroid> no, you can do it without ceil
2010-11-12T07:41:11  <antimatroid> but the games become unfair
2010-11-12T07:41:38  <antimatroid> depending on distribution of planets on each half on each playeyers half of the map
2010-11-12T07:41:53  <antimatroid> so split the map in 4
2010-11-12T07:42:24  <antimatroid> to make it possible with radial symmetry, it needs to be bilaterally symmetric too
2010-11-12T07:43:11  <phreeza> my bots so far could probably deal with any change but this would be really good to know for the new one i'm working on...
2010-11-12T07:43:24  <antimatroid> hence why i'm trying to finalise this

2010-11-12T07:43:40  <antimatroid> i've been waiting for it to change for ages, and it hasn't so i'm pushing for decisions to be made
2010-11-12T07:43:45  <Error323> antimatroid: what if there are ppl with machinelearning algos that used data from the official server etc
2010-11-12T07:43:57  *** cYmen <cYmen!~cymen@squint.a-oben.org> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-12T07:44:01  <antimatroid> Error323: maps are changing no matter what
2010-11-12T07:44:07  <Error323> yes ofc
2010-11-12T07:44:10  <antimatroid> it's an ai contest, not who can solve these 100 maps the best contest
2010-11-12T07:44:11  <Error323> but not that radically
2010-11-12T07:44:31  <antimatroid> the difference with mine really isn't that much imo
2010-11-12T07:44:31  <Error323> just different point symmetry maps
2010-11-12T07:44:52  <antimatroid> i don't expect any bots to really change ranking significantly
2010-11-12T07:45:08  <phreeza> mega1 sounds pretty concerned in the forum :D
2010-11-12T07:45:27  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure he is just opposed to changing it so late
2010-11-12T07:45:43  <antimatroid> but the way i see it, it's always been expected to change, so it's not fucking people over at the last minute
2010-11-12T07:45:46  <Error323> i'm surprised that you are not :P
2010-11-12T07:45:58  <antimatroid> i've been expecting it to always change
2010-11-12T07:45:58  <Error323> well probably because you are in the middle of a rewrite
2010-11-12T07:46:06  <Error323> and the inventor of the new mapgen
2010-11-12T07:46:24  <antimatroid> jeff gave me the idea for the maps months ago when he said he intended to write such a generator
2010-11-12T07:46:28  <antimatroid> no one ever did so I did yesterday
2010-11-12T07:46:45  <antimatroid> the generator is a result of my desire for new maps, not vice versa
2010-11-12T07:47:22  <antimatroid> and the maps are cooler
2010-11-12T07:47:27  <antimatroid> even mega1 admitted that
2010-11-12T07:48:58  <Error323> well so do I
2010-11-12T07:49:09  <Error323> and probably my bot will have a positive effect
2010-11-12T07:49:14  <Error323> on the new set
2010-11-12T07:49:31  <Error323> but for any player with fancy learning algos its a real nightmare
2010-11-12T07:49:33  <phreeza> imo the timeframe is just the killer argument here... a month ago i'm sure it would have been possible, but by now i think its just implicit to most people that it won't change, at least not so severely
2010-11-12T07:49:43  <phreeza> i think the ragebot rule might make sense still
2010-11-12T07:51:12  <antimatroid> i'll grant people the not too close to integer distances too
2010-11-12T07:51:32  <phreeza> Error323: yes its very important to me, in my new bot i match up the mp with previously seen maps. the algorithm to do that has O(n^3), with the current symmetry i only need to match 11, now i would have to match all 23
2010-11-12T07:52:51  <phreeza> and i'm lucky, i haven't even started the learning yet, but still it meany i will only be abler to perform 1/8th of the matches i thought i would
2010-11-12T07:53:37  <phreeza> sorry for the typos, just started on one of these fancy microsoft natural keyboards
2010-11-12T07:56:07  <antimatroid> it was never said people can assume these symmetries hold
2010-11-12T07:56:21  <antimatroid> it's unfair for people who listended to that to then keep it as is
2010-11-12T07:56:41  <antimatroid> that's the way i see it
2010-11-12T07:56:45  <antimatroid> but yes, i'm biased :)
2010-11-12T07:57:01  <Error323> well thats a valid argument to i guess
2010-11-12T07:57:54  <Error323> but you have to agree that the fact that the official server hasn't used this map generator is a bit unfair
2010-11-12T07:58:06  <phreeza> we'll just have to have another season after this, with modified rules ;)
2010-11-12T07:58:23  <antimatroid> how is that unfair?
2010-11-12T07:59:08  <antimatroid> it has always been said that those maps should not be taken as representative of maps used in the final tournament
2010-11-12T07:59:51  <Error323> that would defeat the entire benefit of having the server in the first place
2010-11-12T08:00:20  <phreeza> antimatroid: so whats to stop me from witing another map generator that just produces pahological cases where ragebot wins 90% of the time? :D
2010-11-12T08:00:30  <phreeza> pathological*
2010-11-12T08:00:36  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-12T08:00:45  <Error323> in lets say a day before the end of the contest
2010-11-12T08:01:16  <phreeza> \o/
2010-11-12T08:01:23  <antimatroid> phreeza: because that'd be stupid
2010-11-12T08:01:29  <Error323> lol
2010-11-12T08:01:30  <antimatroid> this map gen is entirely open for scrutiny
2010-11-12T08:01:31  <phreeza> :D
2010-11-12T08:01:35  <antimatroid> it doesn't give anyone advantages
2010-11-12T08:01:52  <antimatroid> the server is there as a guide
2010-11-12T08:01:58  <antimatroid> it
2010-11-12T08:02:01  <Error323> it does give some disadvantages
2010-11-12T08:02:08  <antimatroid> s not even guaranteed that the same ranking would be used during the finals
2010-11-12T08:02:21  <antimatroid> although it looks like it will be, and i agree with that
2010-11-12T08:02:49  <antimatroid> it gives no one a disadvantage that didn't go making assumptions for themselves
2010-11-12T08:03:07  <antimatroid> the alternative advantages people who made assumptions, whereas anyone who didn't should be on equal footing
2010-11-12T08:03:54  <antimatroid> while i'm biased being in the group who didn't make assumptions, i think the fairer thing is to not disadvantage those who didn't make their own assumptions

2010-11-12T08:08:48  <phreeza> yea i guess the argument is not going anywhere... I see your point, to a degree... but I still think its a bad idea at this point.
2010-11-12T08:09:05  <Error323> same here
2010-11-12T08:09:15  <antimatroid> i don't see how it's bad, if people followed the guidelines, there bot would perform fine
2010-11-12T08:09:19  <phreeza> either way, it would be good to have an official decision asap
2010-11-12T08:09:27  <antimatroid> if it doesn't, that's their fault for making assumptions
2010-11-12T08:09:34  <antimatroid> their*
2010-11-12T08:09:49  <Error323> antimatroid: its not just about assumptions
2010-11-12T08:09:57  <Error323> learning algos take time
2010-11-12T08:10:01  <antimatroid> it is, people were free to generate their own test maps
2010-11-12T08:10:14  <Error323> yes but then they don't have the enemy bots
2010-11-12T08:10:21  <Error323> and a lot don't know about tcp
2010-11-12T08:10:34  <antimatroid> you think anyones done machine learning on the main site?
2010-11-12T08:10:36  <Error323> since its nowhere on the site
2010-11-12T08:10:42  <antimatroid> it's in the forums
2010-11-12T08:11:18  <Error323> antimatroid: ppl will definitly have gathered statistics of it i'm sure
2010-11-12T08:12:16  <Error323> and imho ppl using learning algos should not be discouraged because of this stuff since i think they deserve more to win then the heuristic versions
2010-11-12T08:12:26  <Error323> but thats just my opinion +)
2010-11-12T08:12:34  <Error323> and look on ai
2010-11-12T08:12:43  <phreeza> heh
2010-11-12T08:12:53  <antimatroid> i think the bots should work on genreal maps
2010-11-12T08:12:55  <antimatroid> that makes it better ai
2010-11-12T08:13:00  <phreeza> but they are learning from heuristic bots! :D
2010-11-12T08:13:09  <antimatroid> whether it's using machine learning or heuristics
2010-11-12T08:13:23  <antimatroid> i don't think it even changes game play very much

2010-11-12T08:13:58  <Error323> well i guess the fairest thing would be to add the poll on the main site and use the votecount

2010-11-12T08:14:12  <phreeza> maybe someone has something that has O(N_planets!) but tweaked it enough to work on 23 planets

2010-11-12T08:15:52  <antimatroid> i always get back to, it's more unfair to disadvantage those who listended rather than those who made assumptions
2010-11-12T08:16:30  <antimatroid> i think ideally, such decisions should be in stone before the contest even starts, but they weren't

2010-11-12T08:17:02  <Error323> thats why a vote would be the best thing to do imo
2010-11-12T08:17:08  <antimatroid> i don't get what proportions are, which group most deserves to be at a disadvantage?
2010-11-12T08:17:20  <antimatroid> care* what proportions are
2010-11-12T08:17:35  <antimatroid> size of groups should be irrelevant imo
2010-11-12T08:18:34  <phreeza> in the end we're all doing this for fu, right? so why spoil it for many people who have put in the work by crippling their bots, even if it may be technically fair

2010-11-12T08:23:23  <antimatroid> yes
2010-11-12T08:25:10  <antimatroid> directly on the specification page
2010-11-12T08:25:10  <antimatroid> "Maps have no particular dimensions and are defined completely in terms of the planets and fleets in them."
2010-11-12T08:25:10  <antimatroid> "Most maps on the server and in the starter packs were generated programmatically by a Python script. You may also create your own to use for testing."

2010-11-12T10:20:41  <Migi32> the formula to prevent this should be something along the lines of radius=max_radius * random(0.0 to 1.0)^2
2010-11-12T10:21:12  <Migi32> no wait sqrt() instead of ()^2
2010-11-12T10:22:15  <antimatroid> yeah okay, i see what you're getting at
2010-11-12T10:22:20  <antimatroid> i will do that at some point
2010-11-12T10:22:24  <antimatroid> i'm working on my own bot atm
2010-11-12T10:22:58  <Migi32> sure, just wanted to mention it :)
2010-11-12T10:23:06  <bhasker> btw are you guys writing your bot in C++, i am thinking my python version will be too slow to do minmax kind of stuff
2010-11-12T10:23:18  <bhasker> just updating the state/resolving fleets for all planets is taking over 15 ms
2010-11-12T10:23:19  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-12T10:23:27  <bhasker> doing that a few hundred times will probably kill my bot
2010-11-12T10:23:43  <antimatroid> i'm using c++
2010-11-12T10:23:47  <Error323> bhasker: ow i'll get kicked out soon enough, its 17.2 @ tcp
2010-11-12T10:23:53  <antimatroid> although i also gave up on minimax
2010-11-12T10:23:59  <bhasker> pure heuristic now?
2010-11-12T10:24:08  <Error323> i'm trying maximax :P
2010-11-12T10:24:15  <antimatroid> i'm using a tree to generate my moves
2010-11-12T10:24:18  <bhasker> ah 17.2 is like an elo point above my bot but mine is at 58: -\
2010-11-12T10:24:20  <antimatroid> but it's not modelling the opponent
2010-11-12T10:24:28  <Error323> that is mega1's approach.
2010-11-12T10:24:37  <bhasker> ah yea but to do a tree i still need to resolve battles
2010-11-12T10:24:38  <antimatroid> that has alwaays been my heuristic appraoch
2010-11-12T10:24:39  <Error323> bhasker: i just submitted, i'll drop down anyway
2010-11-12T10:24:41  <Migi32> I am too, but bhasker do you know c++ already? If not, it's probably too late to learn it and write a winning entry in it.
2010-11-12T10:25:00  <Error323> got a new idea for the evaluation function.
2010-11-12T10:25:05  <bhasker> yea i know c++
2010-11-12T10:25:09  <bhasker> code in it all the time @ work
2010-11-12T10:25:24  <bhasker> just that python is easy
2010-11-12T10:25:26  <bhasker> to tinker with
2010-11-12T10:25:27  <antimatroid> ahh, the joys of holidays till end of contest
2010-11-12T10:25:48  <antimatroid> python is easy, i'd never done anything with it before today and wrote out a map generator in it
2010-11-12T10:25:49  <Error323> bhasker: i don't think you need to port it untill your minimax is fully working and you can't get it faster
2010-11-12T10:25:53  <antimatroid> without looking a single thing up
2010-11-12T10:25:58  <antimatroid> except how to comment
2010-11-12T10:25:58  <Error323> mostly you want algorithmic optimizations
2010-11-12T10:26:09  <Error323> they are >> then c++ vs pythooon
2010-11-12T10:26:18  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-12T10:26:36  <bhasker> oh well let me try and implement it in python
2010-11-12T10:26:39  <Migi32> ah ok. Well, while it may be beneficial to switch, but computation speed doesn't seem to be the deciding factor in this contest.
2010-11-12T10:26:46  <bhasker> but i think i need to optimize my battle resolution and state update
2010-11-12T10:26:48  <bhasker> its too slow
2010-11-12T10:26:53  <bhasker> 15ms to update all planets is too slow
2010-11-12T10:27:13  <Migi32> is that for 200 turns or just the diameter of the map?
2010-11-12T10:27:14  <bhasker> well migi to do tree searches
2010-11-12T10:27:16  <antimatroid> imo minimax is too hard in one second for this
2010-11-12T10:27:18  <Error323> my heuristic version is blazing fast
2010-11-12T10:27:20  <bhasker> 2x diameter
2010-11-12T10:27:21  <antimatroid> even using c++
2010-11-12T10:27:30  <bhasker> oops rather 2x maxdistance between planets
2010-11-12T10:27:33  <Migi32> then it's indeed quite slow.
2010-11-12T10:27:44  <bhasker> yup
2010-11-12T10:29:54  <bhasker> i think logging is also killing me
2010-11-12T10:30:04  <bhasker> just dumping state at every turn takes that from 15ms to 50ms
2010-11-12T10:30:05  <bhasker> ^
2010-11-12T10:30:20  <bhasker> i think the mistake is i should just update all planets at the same time
2010-11-12T10:30:22  <bhasker> not one at a time
2010-11-12T10:30:28  <bhasker> just advance the world by one time step
2010-11-12T10:30:57  <bhasker> right now my engine is like for p in pw.Planets: updatePlanet(p)
2010-11-12T10:31:26  <bhasker> which basically gets a list of fleets orders them by time and resolves battles at all turns and just duplicates state for the rest
2010-11-12T10:32:12  <Migi32> no I think doing it planet per planet would be faster
2010-11-12T10:32:59  <Migi32> python does have a fast sorting algorithm right?

2010-11-12T11:02:36  <Migi32> that's long :(
2010-11-12T11:02:45  <Migi32> good thing he keeps his server running though :)
2010-11-12T11:03:51  <lavalamp_> yeah...
2010-11-12T11:05:31  <Error323> Migi32: no
2010-11-12T11:07:01  <lavalamp_> I was just thinking that we should try and get some new maps on the server if there's much chance they'll be used
2010-11-12T11:07:43  <Migi32> Error323, ok. I was going to take a shot at tree searches myself, so I wondered. But I just realised alpha-beta isn't even possible with Nash equilibria as node evaluation
2010-11-12T11:09:34  <lavalamp_> it would be interesting to have the server generate a new map for every battle
2010-11-12T11:10:59  <Migi32> you could contact dhartmei at daniel -at- benzedrine -dot- cx

2010-11-12T11:16:38  <antimatroid> lavalamp_: we decided it's better not to use lots of maps

2010-11-12T11:16:47  <antimatroid> that way you have lots of bots playing on the same map
2010-11-12T11:16:54  <antimatroid> although you don't want bots repeating
2010-11-12T11:17:11  <antimatroid> on the same map, so i think the allowable set is going to be extended as the contest runs as needed
2010-11-12T11:17:28  <lavalamp_> yeah, I know it's not real practical (or fair) to do a random one for each game but it would still be interesting
2010-11-12T11:17:49  <antimatroid> i love the new maps, i hope the are allowed

2010-11-12T12:47:12  <antimatroid> there isn't much difference in preferneces atm
2010-11-12T12:48:09  <lavalamp_> the linearly symmetric maps sure look weird if your window isn't square
2010-11-12T12:48:24  <antimatroid> yeah, i have a 24 inch wide screen :P
2010-11-12T12:48:34  <antimatroid> and window is far from square
2010-11-12T12:49:13  <lavalamp_> I think point symmetric is all people thought of because it's the only one that you can generalize to more players
2010-11-12T12:49:29  <antimatroid> you can't do more than 2 players
2010-11-12T12:49:38  <antimatroid> it complicates things beyond imagination
2010-11-12T12:49:57  <lavalamp_> yeah, I agree, but it seems like they were thinking of it at first
2010-11-12T12:50:05  <antimatroid> never going to happen
2010-11-12T12:50:12  <antimatroid> then people need to start worryig about coalitions
2010-11-12T12:50:33  <lavalamp_> yeah, it changes things completely
2010-11-12T12:50:56  <antimatroid> the optimal move isn't to wait like some people thing
2010-11-12T12:51:08  <antimatroid> because smart bots will collude to take you out then battle each other
2010-11-12T12:51:15  <lavalamp_> right
2010-11-12T12:51:35  <lavalamp_> and you can't just start attacking player 2 because then player 3 will take you both out
2010-11-12T12:51:41  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-12T12:51:48  <antimatroid> and then when do you break your coalition?
2010-11-12T12:51:56  <antimatroid> and if there's n players, it's just insane
2010-11-12T12:52:02  <lavalamp_> ...not to mention the fact that nD payoff tables get big fast
2010-11-12T12:52:11  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-12T12:52:26  <antimatroid> i'm making a game theory library, i'm aware of how fast they blow out :|
2010-11-12T12:52:35  <antimatroid> tensors are insane
2010-11-12T12:52:48  <antimatroid> same as game trees
2010-11-12T12:52:58  <antimatroid> or any tree for that matter :P
2010-11-12T12:53:01  <lavalamp_> we could even do non-symmetric maps if the server played 2 game sets
2010-11-12T12:53:07  <lavalamp_> lol yeah
2010-11-12T12:53:18  <antimatroid> i think non-symmetric maps would be quite boring
2010-11-12T12:53:41  <lavalamp_> I suppose if the common case is that one player has a huge advantage, yeah
2010-11-12T12:54:07  <lavalamp_> but do we know that? no one as tried afaik
2010-11-12T12:54:14  <lavalamp_> *h
2010-11-12T12:54:18  <lavalamp_> *has
2010-11-12T12:54:34  <antimatroid> tried non-symmetric maps?
2010-11-12T12:54:43  <antimatroid> i have generated trivial ones testing out cases
2010-11-12T12:54:52  <lavalamp_> ah ok
2010-11-12T12:55:06  <antimatroid> but that's more to check my move selection is working as intended
2010-11-12T12:55:11  <lavalamp_> maybe I should make a few and see what happens
2010-11-12T12:55:19  <lavalamp_> ...after I get my bugs squashed

2010-11-12T13:02:31  <mega1> janzert: oh, cool.
2010-11-12T13:02:54  <mega1> The distribution of ranks of opponents looked fine for my previous submission.
2010-11-12T13:03:03  <mega1> maybe it's just laggggging
2010-11-12T13:03:30  <janzert> btw, the new pairing code can be found in http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/create_matchups.py
2010-11-12T13:03:32  <mega1> using an oldish rank to compute the opponents
2010-11-12T13:04:02  <janzert> the important function here would be choose_opponent
2010-11-12T13:04:20  <janzert> but I'm not seeing anything off the top of my head that should skew the distribution
2010-11-12T13:06:14  <antimatroid> gah, fuuu c++, let me define a priority queue of moves, i defined an inequality operator for you :(
2010-11-12T13:16:46  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4380), Raschi(4363), asavis(4206), shangas(4181), george(4161), davidjliu(4135), bix0r4ever(4131), _Astek_(4118), Accoun(4100), GreenTea(4091)

2010-11-12T13:27:04  <janzert> hmm, I did think of an unintended effect on the distribution of players at the top and bottom of the rankings. Basically the top and bottom will tend toward playing opponents twice the average distance than bots in the middle.
2010-11-12T13:27:27  <antimatroid> mega1: raschi isn't far behind on elo
2010-11-12T13:27:57  <janzert> this is because one side of the distribution is getting cut off since there aren't any players there
2010-11-12T13:28:11  <mega1> janzert: that's a nice property
2010-11-12T13:28:52  <mega1> antimatroid: he has only four games
2010-11-12T13:29:05  <antimatroid> yes, but against reasoanble opponents too :P
2010-11-12T13:29:38  <janzert> ooh, I see it's finally time to anchor the elo range
2010-11-12T13:29:47  <janzert> bottom bot is now at 5 elo
2010-11-12T13:30:04  <antimatroid> he, that took WAY longer than expected
2010-11-12T13:30:10  <janzert> yeah
2010-11-12T13:30:27  <mega1> what does anchoring means?
2010-11-12T13:30:38  <antimatroid> bottom bots elo is fixed i think
2010-11-12T13:30:42  <antimatroid> so it doesn't drop below 0
2010-11-12T13:30:46  <janzert> yes
2010-11-12T13:31:11  <janzert> right now the whole range just keeps the median(?) at 2000
2010-11-12T13:31:24  <janzert> instead we can anchor the worst bot to always be 0
2010-11-12T13:31:29  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-12T13:31:51  <lavalamp_> or you could anchor the best bot at 4500
2010-11-12T13:32:00  <antimatroid> that's boring
2010-11-12T13:32:18  <antimatroid> we need irrational aesthetics thanks :)
2010-11-12T13:32:19  <lavalamp_> better yet, enter ragebot and anchor it at 600
2010-11-12T13:32:24  <janzert> yeah, the absolute number really are meaningless
2010-11-12T13:34:01  <lavalamp_> if you anchor one or two constant bots, then the absolute numbers start to mean something
2010-11-12T13:36:45  <janzert> minimally :)

2010-11-12T13:38:57  <lavalamp_> maybe not if you had two anchor points and scaled appropriately, hm
2010-11-12T13:39:35  <Migi32> all elo scores would vary too wildly then, I think
2010-11-12T13:39:52  <janzert> having multiple anchor players in a rating system can lead to real problems if you aren't very careful
2010-11-12T13:40:31  <Migi32> if ragebot gets a couple good maps and suddenly appears to do really good, and you used it as an anchor, everyone's ELO will drop really fast
2010-11-12T13:40:32  <lavalamp_> I think two would be OK since you just translate for one and scale for the other (and feed the rating algorithm the unmodified numbers)
2010-11-12T13:41:11  <lavalamp_> Hm you might be right about that since ragebot would be playing those near its level
2010-11-12T13:41:23  <McLeopold> amstan: ping
2010-11-12T13:41:27  <lavalamp_> with enough games that effect should dissapear
2010-11-12T13:41:34  <lavalamp_> *disappear
2010-11-12T13:41:37  <janzert> the problem is when there are intransitivities with cycles involving both anchors
2010-11-12T13:42:04  <lavalamp_> why would that cause a problem?
2010-11-12T13:42:29  <lavalamp_> I mean, a worse one than intransitivities already cause the system?
2010-11-12T13:43:12  <Migi32> haha yes if you anchor one bot at 600 (say, starter package) and another at 1000 (say, ragebot) and ragebot by bad luck drops in internal score to below the starter package, your ELO ratings would be inverted
2010-11-12T13:43:36  <Migi32> or is that not how anchors work?
2010-11-12T13:44:02  <lavalamp_> Lol ok I was tihnking more, say, rage bot and my old bot, which is enough better than ragebot that that would never happen
2010-11-12T13:44:15  <janzert> migi32: yeah, that's the basic problem
2010-11-12T13:44:33  <janzert> although the ratings don't actually invert but they will be very wierd
2010-11-12T13:45:08  <lavalamp_> suddenly first is rated .53 below ragebot, haha
2010-11-12T13:46:14  <McLeopold> Just so you know, the elo problem is not solvable.  Relative ratings are the best you can get.
2010-11-12T13:46:38  <Migi32> I'd say, just keep them like they are, fixed average and fixed standard deviation. The people with negative ELO won't notice anyway, I think.

2010-11-12T13:48:29  <Migi32> the fact that top ELO keeps rising kinda reflects the fact that the contest is getting tougher and tougher
2010-11-12T13:48:46  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: yeah, and they're not even relative all the time due to intransitivities. But anchoring can be useful, IIRC the kgs (gokgs.com) rating system has a number of anchors to stabilize it
2010-11-12T13:49:11  <lavalamp_> I think the fact that the top Elo is rising represents the fact that more people have entered :P
2010-11-12T13:49:29  <McLeopold> lavalamp_ is more correct

2010-11-12T13:51:33  <lavalamp_> where?
2010-11-12T13:51:53  <McLeopold> I'm just saying to anchor the top bot at elo=0
2010-11-12T13:51:58  <lavalamp_> ohh
2010-11-12T13:52:16  <lavalamp_> I thought that was in reference to my KGS statement
2010-11-12T13:52:18  <McLeopold> then everyone's goal is just to suck less
2010-11-12T13:52:49  <lavalamp_> Don't they list golf scores that way? how many stokes behind the leader you are?

2010-11-12T13:54:01  <Migi32> how about this: keep elo as it is, but if elo<0, show elo as 0 instead

2010-11-12T13:55:18  <janzert> just for the feelings of those players and aesthetics of the list
2010-11-12T13:56:01  <McLeopold> how about a positive number that says "you are this close to becoming #1"
2010-11-12T13:56:06  <janzert> an advantage of anchoring the minelo is also that it easy at a glance of the top to tell the overall spread
2010-11-12T13:57:54  <janzert> from which you can determine at least the theoretical number of levels of play, where each level is defined as winning against the next lowest a certain percentage of the time
2010-11-12T13:58:10  <lavalamp_> In go, 3/4ths of the ratings are negative

2010-11-12T13:59:34  <lavalamp_> janzert: that may or may not work... I can come up with bots that suck on purpose
2010-11-12T13:59:54  <janzert> the worst bots already lose every game immediately
2010-11-12T14:00:15  <janzert> hard to get worse than that :)
2010-11-12T14:01:28  <lavalamp_> e.g., in go human players can suck at 30 or 40 kyu... random play is estimated to be about 150 kyu, and then you could write algorithms that tried to lose on purpose to do worse than that. If we already have bots that are as terrible as possible, that's distorting the "number of levels" calculation
2010-11-12T14:01:58  <lavalamp_> when you compare it to go or chess, anyway
2010-11-12T14:02:21  <mega1> how is chess elo anchored?
2010-11-12T14:02:23  <janzert> yeah, but I say that is because go and chess aren't calculating it correctly :P
2010-11-12T14:02:36  <mega1> there has been recent talk about chess elo inflation
2010-11-12T14:02:43  <lavalamp_> janzert, that's a possible view :)
2010-11-12T14:03:01  <lavalamp_> mega1, isn't there always talk about that?
2010-11-12T14:03:04  <janzert> mega1: I don't think it is just recent
2010-11-12T14:03:23  <lavalamp_> I don't believe chess is anchored
2010-11-12T14:03:29  <lavalamp_> unless they started it recently
2010-11-12T14:03:36  <mega1> recent as in past couple of years
2010-11-12T14:03:49  <janzert> lavalamp_: yeah, I don't think so
2010-11-12T14:04:08  <janzert> mega1: It's been ongoing for as long as I can remember which is at least 12 years
2010-11-12T14:04:26  <lavalamp_> "what rating would XXX have today?"
2010-11-12T14:05:10  <mega1> yeah, masters of old would always rule ;-)
2010-11-12T14:06:17  <Migi32> to me, only the top 10 and how many people are still better than me are important anyway :)
2010-11-12T14:09:16  <McLeopold> Migi32: so, 11 total? :P
2010-11-12T14:09:37  <Migi32> yep :)

2010-11-12T14:18:36  <janzert> basically the arbitrary offset is removed but not the 0 anchor

2010-11-12T14:20:50  <McLeopold> I'm fond of my "jump map" idea. :)
2010-11-12T14:21:31  <McLeopold> Also, everyone on IRC needs to vote for different map types... or else.
2010-11-12T14:22:28  <McLeopold> I'm not really good a persuasion.
2010-11-12T14:23:44  <McLeopold> janzert: does it concern you that I went from 78ish to 168ish in one day?
2010-11-12T14:23:57  <Migi32> I like the different ideas but whatever you decide on please make it official quite some time before the deadline (which means, like, right now)
2010-11-12T14:24:45  <McLeopold> Migi32: I don't want you to miss the point.  Talk about "how" it would affect bots.  Not if we should or not.
2010-11-12T14:25:00  <janzert> McLeopold: yes, but I also understand the problem and am working to correct it :)
2010-11-12T14:25:14  <Migi32> ok, well one thing is that bots using minimax will probably start faltering if you add maps with 50+ ships
2010-11-12T14:25:26  <McLeopold> Does it mean I had an inflated rank?  From being a really old bot?
2010-11-12T14:25:26  <Migi32> 50+ planets*
2010-11-12T14:25:26  <janzert> at an admittedly slow and often diverted pace
2010-11-12T14:25:54  <McLeopold> Yeah, or adding more planets.
2010-11-12T14:26:04  <McLeopold> All bots would be slower with more planets.
2010-11-12T14:26:10  <janzert> McLeopold: no, it means the current method of using only the past 3 days of games for ranking is too volatile
2010-11-12T14:26:27  <McLeopold> 3 days?  that's it?
2010-11-12T14:26:45  <janzert> yep, and it now takes 4 minutes just to run the query for that
2010-11-12T14:27:36  <Zannick> the table has very very many games in it
2010-11-12T14:27:43  <McLeopold> I wouldn't mind waited 30 minutes between rank updates.
2010-11-12T14:27:46  <Migi32> what I would like though is planets started with 1000 ships instead of 100 and then growth would be random between 0 and 50, not only multiples of 10, to give a hard time to algorithms that scale with absolute numbers (like 0-1 knapsack)
2010-11-12T14:28:11  <McLeopold> Migi32: I agree
2010-11-12T14:28:22  <Error323> oef that would hurt my system :P
2010-11-12T14:28:23  <McLeopold> That was my growth map suggestion.
2010-11-12T14:29:00  <Migi32> ah yes, I only read up to "all growths where multiples of 10"
2010-11-12T14:29:20  <McLeopold> That was just the agrument to say that it doesn't need to be limited.
2010-11-12T14:29:42  <McLeopold> Or at least wouldn't change much.
2010-11-12T14:29:58  <Migi32> how about floating point numbers ;)
2010-11-12T14:30:19  <Zannick> sent 26.66666666 ships directly to the opponent's planet
2010-11-12T14:30:47  <McLeopold> 2.6x10^7 ships to planet 1
2010-11-12T14:30:55  <Migi32> and I will send 26.66666667 ;)
2010-11-12T14:30:55  <McLeopold> engage!
2010-11-12T14:31:30  <Error323> i will send i^9
2010-11-12T14:32:03  <McLeopold> 3 dimensional maps would be fun to watch.  I don't think it would change the game much.
2010-11-12T14:32:52  <Zannick> i^9 is just i

2010-11-12T14:46:18  <janzert> hehe, no but working on the system that does it
2010-11-12T14:46:55  <Error323> on the live server interesting :P
2010-11-12T14:47:20  <lavalamp_> janzert, if I updated the scripts to 1. make an additional table (leaderboard_calc) 2. replace the data in that table instead of adding to it 3. do the queries out of that table: would that help you at all?
2010-11-12T14:47:58  <janzert> hmm? what's in leaderboard_calc?
2010-11-12T14:48:17  <lavalamp_> Only the most recent leaderboard, instead of every single one
2010-11-12T14:48:33  <lavalamp_> My memory may be fuzzy, it's been a few days since I looked at it
2010-11-12T14:48:38  <janzert> nah, there isn't any bottleneck there
2010-11-12T14:48:54  <janzert> the bottleneck is getting the game result data
2010-11-12T14:48:56  <Error323> where is the bottleneck?
2010-11-12T14:48:58  <lavalamp_> ok I must have misunderstood which table
2010-11-12T14:49:07  <janzert> I'll probably split up the games table soon
2010-11-12T14:49:17  <Zannick> that's probably what you want to do
2010-11-12T14:49:19  <lavalamp_> ok then I'll stop bothering you
2010-11-12T14:49:21  <janzert> basically archive games that are between old submissions
2010-11-12T14:49:40  <lavalamp_> that works too
2010-11-12T14:52:05  <Error323> I love the truely awesome amount of gpm

2010-11-12T17:00:11  <McLeopold> Haven't really looked yet.
2010-11-12T17:00:45  <antimatroid> i don't think the concept of growth maps, it's basically turning it into who can solve a decision problem most optimally, not who can play a a game the best
2010-11-12T17:01:00  <antimatroid> same with my problem with mario ai, it's not really a game, but a decision problem
2010-11-12T17:01:30  <antimatroid> think/like* :P
2010-11-12T17:01:43  <McLeopold> that's part of the game.  How would you take that out?
2010-11-12T17:02:13  <antimatroid> my final bot is being written as something that just tries to maximise anyway
2010-11-12T17:02:18  <Accoun> now we have 2 9n places http://ai-contest.com/rankings.php
2010-11-12T17:03:04  <antimatroid> but on those maps, your moves don't really affect the other player until the game is pretty much decided
2010-11-12T17:03:24  <Zannick> and 2 31s, and two 41s, and three 55s...
2010-11-12T17:03:24  <McLeopold> hmm...
2010-11-12T17:03:59  <antimatroid> there has always been draws
2010-11-12T17:04:02  <McLeopold> antimatroid: so you would prefer maps where you can affect your opponent sooner than later?
2010-11-12T17:06:12  <antimatroid> i want maps where the outcome isn't strictly determined by ones ability to expand before even reaching the enemy
2010-11-12T17:06:30  <antimatroid> otherwise i feel the problem is no longer much of a game but more of a decision problem
2010-11-12T17:06:46  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be opposed to some maps like that i guess, but it doesn't seem very gamy
2010-11-12T17:07:35  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I agree, my idea of growth maps wasn't disconnected clusters, but rather planets that are spread out and just take longer to aquire.
2010-11-12T17:07:56  <Error323> are there new maps on the server?
2010-11-12T17:08:03  <McLeopold> I really dislike the maps which are to giant blobs on either side of a map.
2010-11-12T17:09:17  <antimatroid> ahhh okay, amstan suggested two big glog maps yesterday and i wasn't a fan
2010-11-12T17:09:21  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm looking at the maps with some test games right now...
2010-11-12T17:09:22  <antimatroid> that's what i was referring to
2010-11-12T17:09:36  <antimatroid> 300-400 are coolest imo
2010-11-12T17:10:11  <antimatroid> you will get both kinds of symmetry in there, and non radially symmetric maps can have multiple neutrals starting at an equal distance to each player
2010-11-12T17:10:22  <antimatroid> and varying number of planets :)

2010-11-12T17:10:58  <McLeopold> ooh, these maps are revealing weaknesses in my bot!
2010-11-12T17:11:33  <McLeopold> besides the ones mega1 already revealed...
2010-11-12T17:13:07  <antimatroid> i don't think it's fair to say some people assumed they would only have maps like the examples, therefore everyone else should be restricted to that
2010-11-12T17:13:18  <antimatroid> even though many of us haven't been working under any such restriction the whole time

2010-11-12T17:13:51  <McLeopold> If we could push the deadline, that would be awesome.  Everyone get's an extra week for dealing with the new maps.
2010-11-12T17:13:59  <antimatroid> i also think the closer the players starting angles, the better one needs to be at expanding without being sniped
2010-11-12T17:14:34  <McLeopold> these maps will definatly change the game.
2010-11-12T17:14:42  <antimatroid> but it's still a very valid form of map, i don't see how it matters what kind of maps are used in the final contest, provided they're symmetric
2010-11-12T17:14:57  <McLeopold> Often, the best expansion route is the opposite of you opponent, so you don't really meet up right away.
2010-11-12T17:15:04  <antimatroid> people were told the example maps aren't exhaustive testing tools
2010-11-12T17:15:09  <McLeopold> Now it's the same direction, like big center maps.
2010-11-12T17:15:31  <McLeopold> I think these will reduce the average number of turns per game.
2010-11-12T17:15:33  <antimatroid> is it not unfair to people who didn't make assumptions to now restrict the domain of possible maps?
2010-11-12T17:16:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid: well, everyone has to make assumptions somewhere, and processing time has been an issue
2010-11-12T17:16:33  <McLeopold> so, it is slightly unfair if someone has to do a re-write to support this.
2010-11-12T17:16:41  <antimatroid> the new maps shouldn't really change processing time

2010-11-12T17:17:00  <antimatroid> we're not asking to extend max dist to 1000 and have 100 planets
2010-11-12T17:17:02  <McLeopold> If the planet count is the same or less, probably not too much.
2010-11-12T17:17:36  <antimatroid> i think planets <= 30 is good
2010-11-12T17:17:53  <McLeopold> If everything is not "official" yet anyway, just do a couple of days on the official servers with these maps.
2010-11-12T17:18:07  <antimatroid> it's tricky to remove maps once they're added
2010-11-12T17:18:27  <antimatroid> we really need dhartmei to stick some on tcp, but i don't know how to get ahold of him
2010-11-12T17:18:32  <antimatroid> i tried an email address, but it bounced

2010-11-12T21:47:03  <antimatroid> looks like poll preference is slightly in favour of using them atm, and I know jeff and amstan liked them, so i would say there's a reasonable chance of it happening though

2010-11-12T23:19:12  <lavalamp_> for testing, maybe...
2010-11-12T23:19:25  <lavalamp_> the point maps are symmetric around planet 0
2010-11-12T23:19:43  <antimatroid> yes, and my generator then translates them so all coordinates are positive
2010-11-12T23:19:48  <lavalamp_> I don't know if anyone relies on that or no...

2010-11-12T23:20:13  <lavalamp_> ah, isn't it already if it depends on the planet positions?
2010-11-12T23:20:18  <Zannick> the current generator simply uses the min value of each coord
2010-11-12T23:20:29  <Zannick> effectively, that means some planets have coords of 0
2010-11-12T23:20:36  <eburnette> try it in the viewers to see if it works there
2010-11-12T23:20:44  <Zannick> they don't have to be strictly positive, but nonnegative is good
2010-11-12T23:20:56  <lavalamp_> antimatroid's maps all seem to work in jbotmanager
2010-11-12T23:21:11  <antimatroid> but with a line symmetric map, i dont' think you can deduce the centre without knowledge of the amount transposed
2010-11-12T23:21:18  <antimatroid> because there isn't necessarily a centre neutral
2010-11-12T23:21:34  <Zannick> didn't you make a center neutral in your generator?
2010-11-12T23:21:39  <Zannick> or is this another one?
2010-11-12T23:21:46  <antimatroid> it can do multiple centre neutrals for line symmetric maps
2010-11-12T23:21:52  <antimatroid> and they don't need to be in the dead centre
2010-11-12T23:21:55  <lavalamp_> honestly I don't think it's an important detail
2010-11-12T23:21:58  <Zannick> ah, you added more
2010-11-12T23:22:05  <antimatroid> you can do more for point symmetric, but they need to be doubled on the other side of the centre line
2010-11-12T23:22:11  <Zannick> i...don't want to worry about adding those
2010-11-12T23:22:14  <lavalamp_> people should do the math and figure out what planets are equidistant already

2010-11-12T23:23:31  <antimatroid> Zannick and eburnette: what do you guys think of the maps?
2010-11-12T23:23:43  <Zannick> i haven't really looked
2010-11-12T23:24:12  <Zannick> i like the line symmetric for maps with a center neutral, from the pictures you posted a while back
2010-11-12T23:24:29  <antimatroid> i'll screen shot one with more centre neutrals for you
2010-11-12T23:24:48  <eburnette> i'll look as soon as I unbreak my bot
2010-11-12T23:26:40  *** jmpespxoreax is now known as jmacmaho
2010-11-12T23:26:45  <antimatroid> http://imgur.com/vp1fA.png there's a line synmetric map with multiple "centre neutrals"
2010-11-12T23:26:49  <lavalamp_> I posted a bunch of maps in one of the threads
2010-11-12T23:26:56  <antimatroid> that's one of them
2010-11-12T23:27:08  <lavalamp_> yeah those are interesting
2010-11-12T23:27:11  *** jmacmaho is now known as jmpespxoreax
2010-11-12T23:32:03  *** jmpespxoreax <jmpespxoreax!~notauser@69-165-151-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has left #aichallenge
2010-11-12T23:33:20  <Zannick> hm
2010-11-12T23:33:28  <Zannick> is that 17 planet number 0?
2010-11-12T23:35:07  *** jmpespxoreax <jmpespxoreax!~notauser@69-165-151-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-12T23:35:09  <antimatroid> player 1's planet is planet 0, player 2's is planet 1
2010-11-12T23:35:17  <antimatroid> then the centre planets come next, then the pairs
2010-11-12T23:35:52  <eburnette> shouldn't center come first, by convention if not rule?
2010-11-12T23:35:53  *** jmpespxoreax <jmpespxoreax!~notauser@69-165-151-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has left #aichallenge
2010-11-12T23:36:18  <Zannick> yeah, i kinda dislike that
2010-11-12T23:36:18  <antimatroid> i have to generate the players locations first before doing the centers like that
2010-11-12T23:36:20  <eburnette> My bot doesn't care
2010-11-12T23:36:28  <antimatroid> it's just easier, it shouldn't break any bot that followed the rules
2010-11-12T23:36:44  <antimatroid> it can be changed if people really care
2010-11-12T23:36:55  <antimatroid> but there isn't necessarily a planet at (0,0) on that map
2010-11-12T23:37:18  <Zannick> planets at (0,0) don't matter, i think, so much as 0=neutral, 1=p1, 2=p2
2010-11-12T23:37:25  <antimatroid> why?
2010-11-12T23:37:53  <eburnette> well just for fun then put home planets at random locations in the list
2010-11-12T23:37:57  <Zannick> the latter is an easier optimization to make to figure out the center planet and starters
2010-11-12T23:37:57  <antimatroid> people seem to be under the impression that the example map generator was meant to be taken as the official one
2010-11-12T23:38:14  <Zannick> it was the official one
2010-11-12T23:38:20  <Zannick> it was never an example
2010-11-12T23:38:25  <antimatroid> it was always an example
2010-11-12T23:38:32  <antimatroid> jeff cameron has said numerous times it will not be kept
2010-11-12T23:38:37  <eburnette> let's see how many bots we can break - change everything possible not specified by the rules
2010-11-12T23:38:49  <Zannick> well, copybot and my current submission will break
2010-11-12T23:38:52  <antimatroid> these were the rules
2010-11-12T23:39:05  <antimatroid> everyone has been told the whole time, don't make assumptions
2010-11-12T23:39:07  <Zannick> because i optimized for the other maps
2010-11-12T23:39:10  <eburnette> maybe if enough bots break i'll have a better chance :)
2010-11-12T23:39:14  <antimatroid> it's unfair to peple who didn't to then restrict the domain of maps
2010-11-12T23:39:26  <Zannick> i'm more upset because i told other people those things :/
2010-11-12T23:39:47  <eburnette> (I'm being sarcastic btw)
2010-11-12T23:40:01  <Zannick> i could probably make a one-line fix, though
2010-11-12T23:40:08  <Zannick> and disable my special first-turn logic
2010-11-12T23:40:12  <antimatroid> Zannick: how would your bot break?
2010-11-12T23:40:17  *** jmpespxoreax <jmpespxoreax!~notauser@69-165-151-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-12T23:40:27  <antimatroid> and is the first turn logic not based off an assumption you made?
2010-11-12T23:40:42  <lavalamp_> before this morning, my bot assumed 5 was teh max growth and 23 was the number of planets
2010-11-12T23:40:52  <lavalamp_> fortunately it wasn't too hard to fix
2010-11-12T23:41:07  <antimatroid> my bot will just read what it's given
2010-11-12T23:41:12  <Zannick> on the first turn it says, who owns planet 1? if 1, then it's mine, if 2, then i own 2. no owns 0, and that's equidistant so ignore it for now
2010-11-12T23:41:19  <antimatroid> i think it'd probably die if planet size went far above 50
2010-11-12T23:41:20  <eburnette> make a map that has all 0-growth planets, that would be fun
2010-11-12T23:41:23  <antimatroid> but probably not time out
2010-11-12T23:41:28  <Zannick> and copybot will break entirely
2010-11-12T23:41:32  <Zannick> but that's less important
2010-11-12T23:41:34  <antimatroid> that would actually be quite fun
2010-11-12T23:42:22  <antimatroid> copybot could be fixed easily enough
2010-11-12T23:42:26  <eburnette> that should make people get lots of divide by zero exceptions, and eliminate a few more losers
2010-11-12T23:42:29  <antimatroid> it just needs to go through and pair planets at the start
2010-11-12T23:42:43  <Zannick> i'm not fixing it :P i don't have time
2010-11-12T23:42:52  <antimatroid> but i think anyone that assumed map planets would take any particularly order made as stupid an assumption as those who expected only one kind of symmetry
2010-11-12T23:43:11  <Zannick> :(
2010-11-12T23:43:12  <antimatroid> tron maps had multiple symmetries
2010-11-12T23:43:26  <Zannick> okay, i made stupid assumptions
2010-11-12T23:43:29  <antimatroid> :P, sorry, but i don't want the domain of maps restricted
2010-11-12T23:43:32  * Zannick ->
2010-11-12T23:43:35  <eburnette> here's an idea - add a couple of extra planet owners that just sit there and see if anybody will conquer them
2010-11-12T23:43:49  <antimatroid> extra planet owners?
2010-11-12T23:43:54  <antimatroid> the game can't go to more than 2 players
2010-11-12T23:44:01  <antimatroid> that is an entirely new game
2010-11-12T23:44:06  <eburnette> players 3, 4, 5, rules allow it
2010-11-12T23:44:12  <Zannick> not the contest rules
2010-11-12T23:44:28  <Zannick> plus they would be ejected on turn one for not making moves
2010-11-12T23:44:32  <antimatroid> as soon as n>2 you start having to form coalitions
2010-11-12T23:44:37  <antimatroid> it's a completely different game
2010-11-12T23:44:47  <antimatroid> it's like saying, right, your bots are now fighting in a mario kart battle
2010-11-12T23:45:07  <eburnette> no i mean these aren't AIs or people, it's like some dead civilization with stationary ships
2010-11-12T23:45:19  <Zannick> eburnette: "neutral"
2010-11-12T23:45:20  <antimatroid> so it's just another neutral?
2010-11-12T23:45:33  <antimatroid> or growing neutrals?
2010-11-12T23:45:37  <Zannick> the engine won't readily support that
2010-11-12T23:46:02  <eburnette> sort of like neutrals except owner is not == 0
2010-11-12T23:46:27  <Zannick> i do not believe the engine will support that *
2010-11-12T23:46:39  <eburnette> sure, lettem grow too, that would be interesting.. timing exactly when to capture them
2010-11-12T23:47:03  <antimatroid> i like the 0 growth map idea
2010-11-12T23:47:08  <Zannick> i have a script that lets you run 3 players on a map
2010-11-12T23:47:13  <eburnette> early when they're cheap? or later if you have to expand
2010-11-12T23:47:20  <Zannick> so long as you specify player 3 start planet
2010-11-12T23:47:28  <antimatroid> actually, 0 growth map is an easy tie
2010-11-12T23:47:38  <antimatroid> always jump around with your full 100 ships
2010-11-12T23:47:48  <Zannick> no, just never move
2010-11-12T23:47:54  <antimatroid> yeah or that
2010-11-12T23:47:59  <antimatroid> :P
2010-11-12T23:48:33  <antimatroid> although, if you trusted yourself, you could try to tempt them into trying to take you
2010-11-12T23:48:35  <eburnette> hmm yeah guess you're right
2010-11-12T23:48:35  <antimatroid> and take the win
2010-11-12T23:48:42  <antimatroid> and possibly do bette than all draws
2010-11-12T23:49:15  <eburnette> too bad we can't have negative growth, black holes
2010-11-12T23:49:17  <antimatroid> although if their bot strictly does nothing, you lose
2010-11-12T23:49:24  <antimatroid> no one would move there
2010-11-12T23:49:26  <antimatroid> pretty simple
2010-11-12T23:49:42  <antimatroid> no sucking action from planets :P
2010-11-12T23:51:11  <eburnette> actually wouldn't it be better to attack the other home planet? you might get a 1 move growth advantage
2010-11-12T23:51:30  <eburnette> cause they can't react until next move
2010-11-12T23:52:10  <Zannick> i'm confused. a 0 growth map has all 0 growth planets, no?
2010-11-12T23:52:25  <Zannick> so the players won't ever gain ships?
2010-11-12T23:52:26  <eburnette> home planet has growth
2010-11-12T23:52:49  <Zannick> oh
2010-11-12T23:52:55  <Zannick> then either stay or attack
2010-11-12T23:52:58  <antimatroid> oh, i thought that was 0 too
2010-11-12T23:53:04  <antimatroid> yeah, ^^ that
2010-11-12T23:53:09  <Zannick> either way, stay or attack
2010-11-12T23:53:11  <eburnette> maybe you could make home planets and 1 other have growth to prevent a tie
2010-11-12T23:53:24  <Zannick> draw unless someone goes for a neutral and loses ships
2010-11-12T23:53:26  <lavalamp_> my bot shouldn't be having epic battles with ragebot >:(
2010-11-12T23:54:59  <antimatroid> haha
2010-11-12T23:55:15  <antimatroid> how does one have an epic battle with ragebot?
2010-11-12T23:55:27  <lavalamp_> I broke defense completely but it can still attack fine
2010-11-12T23:55:47  <antimatroid> how old is that revision?
2010-11-12T23:55:58  <antimatroid> i started a fresh one for the final submission
2010-11-12T23:56:02  <lavalamp_> of my bot? about 10 minutes
2010-11-12T23:56:12  <antimatroid> so i can try and but out all the bugs and short cuts i previousloy made
2010-11-12T23:56:21  <antimatroid> no, from a fresh starter pack
2010-11-12T23:56:23  <lavalamp_> I'll put it up on tcp when I get defense fixed
2010-11-12T23:56:34  <antimatroid> i'm days away from even testing this new bot
2010-11-12T23:56:37  <lavalamp_> I missed something... revision of what?
2010-11-12T23:56:48  <antimatroid> like, start from a bare starter package
2010-11-12T23:57:06  <lavalamp_> anyway, g2g... later
2010-11-12T23:57:14  <eburnette> alright I'm trying your weirdmaps2
2010-11-12T23:57:25  <antimatroid> they don't disappoint :P
2010-11-12T23:57:31  <eburnette> my bot is not crashing
2010-11-12T23:57:53  <antimatroid> no bot should crash unless they made errors
2010-11-12T23:58:23  <eburnette> but it's not winning much for some reason
2010-11-12T23:58:26  <antimatroid> although it took me a bit of work to be able to feel my bot a map starting with fleets
2010-11-12T23:58:41  <antimatroid> is your defense still broken?
2010-11-12T23:58:51  <antimatroid> i think that becomes more important as the starting angles become closer
2010-11-12T23:59:00  <antimatroid> and you need to be better at expanding without becoming vulnerable
2010-11-12T23:59:11  <antimatroid> that's my initial thoughts on them anyway
2010-11-12T23:59:21  <antimatroid> i haven't got a reasonable bot to test out on them yet
2010-11-12T23:59:22  <eburnette> we don't need no steenkeng defense
