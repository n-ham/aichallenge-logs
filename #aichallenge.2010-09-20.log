2010-09-20T00:00:00  <McLeopold> deepblue: just curious, you don't have to answer, but do you have turn limit logic in your code?
2010-09-20T00:00:09  <deepblue> no
2010-09-20T00:00:18  <deepblue> mine just wants to win
2010-09-20T00:00:19  <McLeopold> I saw a game where you had a hugh advantage but lost it after 200
2010-09-20T00:00:26  <deepblue> yeah
2010-09-20T00:00:29  <deepblue> that had other reasons ;)
2010-09-20T00:00:35  <jmcarthur> mine will have turn limit aware
2010-09-20T00:00:38  <jmcarthur> *will be
2010-09-20T00:00:49  <deepblue> i just don't like the idea
2010-09-20T00:00:54  <deepblue> to tailor it to the contest :/
2010-09-20T00:00:57  <McLeopold> me neither
2010-09-20T00:00:57  <sigh> eventually all the top bots will be, i think
2010-09-20T00:01:08  <sigh> me neither, but that's the way it will go
2010-09-20T00:01:15  <McLeopold> Well, not number #1.  :D
2010-09-20T00:01:17  <jmcarthur> IMO the turn limit is simply a part of the problem statement (and should therefore be nailed down)
2010-09-20T00:01:29  <sigh> McLeopold: "eventually"
2010-09-20T00:01:47  <McLeopold> yes, there is no way I can last 2 months.
2010-09-20T00:01:58  <jmcarthur> "have the most ships after turn 200"
2010-09-20T00:02:08  <deepblue> I just uploaded some fresh version to the official site
2010-09-20T00:02:12  <deepblue> let's see how it does :)
2010-09-20T00:02:26  <McLeopold> I hope you go the the top again.  I was dissapointed to see you fall.
2010-09-20T00:02:28  <deepblue> my friend had the idea
2010-09-20T00:02:41  <deepblue> of just doing very stupid things in the last turns when it's clear that you certainly win
2010-09-20T00:02:46  <McLeopold> So, new stragety altogether?

2010-09-20T00:04:59  <deepblue> the server is quick
2010-09-20T00:05:37  <McLeopold> Yea, you get your first game right away.
2010-09-20T00:05:40  <sigh> awesome, you beat someone ranked ~1000

2010-09-20T00:33:19  <sigh> genericbob: for variety?
2010-09-20T00:33:52  <McLeopold> are there any mirror image maps?
2010-09-20T00:34:50  <genericbob> I created some, but I don't think they are on any servers.
2010-09-20T00:34:54  <sigh> I'm guessing these were generated with the official script, in which case, no
2010-09-20T00:35:22  <sigh> but yeah, genericbob's been talking about his uber-generic map generating scripts :D
2010-09-20T00:36:00  <McLeopold> It would be fun to have non-semetrical maps.  Everytime a side losses, modify the map to give that side 1 more starting fleet.
2010-09-20T00:36:10  <deepblue> mirrored maps are for pu**ies ;)
2010-09-20T00:36:15  <McLeopold> Until you find a maps equalibrium.
2010-09-20T00:36:34  <Cyndre> I suggested just play those games twice but everyone hated on me - shhhh
2010-09-20T00:36:39  <deepblue> yes :)
2010-09-20T00:36:48  <deepblue> I like playing twice
2010-09-20T00:36:54  <McLeopold> I think you'd have a tie everytime...
2010-09-20T00:37:13  <McLeopold> One win for each side, every time.
2010-09-20T00:37:16  <deepblue> only if they are really off
2010-09-20T00:37:20  <McLeopold> true.
2010-09-20T00:37:29  <deepblue> and all the bots equally strong
2010-09-20T00:37:39  <Cyndre> but then that also allows more strategy to
2010-09-20T00:37:48  <deepblue> the really strong bots then can make their points on the symmetric ones
2010-09-20T00:38:07  <Cyndre> yes equaling less games
2010-09-20T00:38:38  <McLeopold> Hmm.  New entry must beat rage bot on a map in there favor... other wise their entry is rejected.
2010-09-20T00:38:47  <McLeopold> And everyone else gets more games!
2010-09-20T00:39:01  <McLeopold> [sic]their
2010-09-20T00:39:08  <deepblue> everybot has to win against ragebot on 30
2010-09-20T00:39:18  <McLeopold> 30 is evil
2010-09-20T00:39:22  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-20T00:39:39  <McLeopold> The first time I lost on 30 I crapped my pants.

2010-09-20T00:40:02  <sigh> I was like wtf when a1k0n posted on the forums that he was 100/100 against ragebot
2010-09-20T00:40:03  <deepblue> it's part of my standard testing routine
2010-09-20T00:40:11  <McLeopold> I thought of writing, if round < 1, do nothing, just for that.
2010-09-20T00:40:17  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-20T00:40:17  <sigh> but then he updated later with something lame like 87/100

2010-09-20T00:50:31  <McLeopold> yeah, maybe at least 200, 10 extra after the last neutral?
2010-09-20T00:50:35  <Cyndre> if I have 2 more growth then you and you have 500 more ships then me I will never win
2010-09-20T00:50:53  <McLeopold> Unless my bot goes catatonic?
2010-09-20T00:51:09  <McLeopold> Were not writing perfect bots here...
2010-09-20T00:51:10  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i don't think that would actually change the outcome of any of the games you have used as examples, would it?
2010-09-20T00:51:32  <Cyndre> its not about perfect bots, its about if Im gaining ground and only lose because of a turn limit - kinda sucks
2010-09-20T00:51:37  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: it's hard to tell, I can't query the raw data

2010-09-20T00:52:18  <jmcarthur> i once considered x turns after the last "cross-over", where a cross-over is a point where the upper hand switches sides, but even that isn't sufficient (when bots simply switch back and forth repeatedly)

2010-09-20T00:52:49  <Cyndre> thats a good one
2010-09-20T00:52:55  <jmcarthur> honestly if you guys "only lose because of a turn limit" then it's because you weren't playing by the same rules as everybody else: "have the most ships after 200 turns"
2010-09-20T00:52:56  <McLeopold> I think x turns after the last neutral takeover would be best, if anything.  Eventually you would run out and i'd have to end.
2010-09-20T00:53:24  <jmcarthur> i'm fine with the objective not being "completely kill the other player"
2010-09-20T00:54:42  <Cyndre> not sure why my bot was keeping that big bunch of planets around
2010-09-20T00:54:58  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: what about a large margin for draws?  what's your option?
2010-09-20T00:55:19  <Cyndre> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=51567  or look at this one - we were deadlocked and then bang he made a mistake
2010-09-20T00:55:31  <jmcarthur> well, if we say the objective is as i've stated it then it makes sense for draws to only be when ships are exactly the same
2010-09-20T00:55:47  <Cyndre> what about growth rate?
2010-09-20T00:55:52  <jmcarthur> and if it's a win by only 1 ship, well, that bot planned better
2010-09-20T00:56:16  <Cyndre> growthRate, planetsControlled, and Ships should be compared
2010-09-20T00:56:16  <contestbot> Top 10 players: McLeopold(3610), kcm1700(3451), EBraun(3435), paulus(3386), adumlah(3353), golfin(3326), sighbot(3316), kevlar(3277), wagstaff(3247), Titannet1(3228)
2010-09-20T00:56:32  <jmcarthur> factoring in growth rate just muddies the rules. doesn't necessarily make the game more interesting
2010-09-20T00:56:35  <jmcarthur> IMO
2010-09-20T00:56:54  <McLeopold> playing for a draw might make it more interesting
2010-09-20T00:57:04  <jmcarthur> you can still play for a draw
2010-09-20T00:57:14  <jmcarthur> and if it's difficult it means you are far enough behind to lose anyway
2010-09-20T00:57:20  <McLeopold> but it's like trying to bring down the death star
2010-09-20T00:57:33  <jmcarthur> right. you lost :P
2010-09-20T00:57:34  <McLeopold> but the rebels still win
2010-09-20T00:58:05  <Cyndre> yea but if I have higher growth rate and nothing changes I win

2010-09-20T00:58:13  <McLeopold> so, at this point is it just trying to find the magic turn limit number?
2010-09-20T00:58:39  <Cyndre> but if its a close game - a few growthRate in difference, 200 turns is only 400 ships
2010-09-20T00:58:45  <Cyndre> at 2 growthRate difference
2010-09-20T00:58:54  <McLeopold> It would be nice to see some stats on average game length per player
2010-09-20T00:58:55  <Cyndre> at which point each side could have 2000 ships
2010-09-20T00:59:00  <jmcarthur> i think changing the endgame conditions is just arbitrary and a matter of opinion, not really a game changer (except for making turn limit variable or nonexistent, in which case many algorithms become invalid)

2010-09-20T00:59:48  <Cyndre> that game is clearly not over :)
2010-09-20T00:59:56  <jmcarthur> my bot, for example, relies critically on the existence of a concrete turn count
2010-09-20T01:00:32  <jmcarthur> that game is over because the rules (should) say it's over
2010-09-20T01:00:40  <jmcarthur> and the winner won because he had the upper hand
2010-09-20T01:00:45  <jmcarthur> at the right time
2010-09-20T01:00:50  <McLeopold> nope, that game wasn't over at all
2010-09-20T01:00:58  <Cyndre> or have a player global turn count - you get 200 turns per game and if you dont use them all they goto a pool that you can borrow from
2010-09-20T01:01:07  <McLeopold> except for the rules, yes
2010-09-20T01:01:16  <Cyndre> lmao

2010-09-20T01:02:10  <McLeopold> good point
2010-09-20T01:02:13  <Cyndre> but 200 turns isnt enough for a difference to be seen
2010-09-20T01:02:24  <McLeopold> not so much in baseball
2010-09-20T01:02:37  <McLeopold> nor football (american)

2010-09-20T01:02:57  <jmcarthur> i simply think it should be fixed

2010-09-20T01:04:00  <Cyndre> what you should do is have a way to pit two bots on map y or an admin can replay a game for longer turns
2010-09-20T01:04:06  <jmcarthur> it would be nice to have started longer and cut it as time goes by rather than the other way, i agree
2010-09-20T01:04:38  <McLeopold> some bots use random, so you can't replay
2010-09-20T01:04:43  <Cyndre> 4/5 of McLeopolds losses were at 200 turns
2010-09-20T01:05:27  <jmcarthur> i just don't think we need some stronger sense of "closure" in a close game that finished due to a turn limit if we just accept that the objective is to have the most ships at a particular turn
2010-09-20T01:05:50  <Cyndre> but my argument is if you dont get a good start, but catch them in a mistake there sno point
2010-09-20T01:05:51  <McLeopold> once I accept that, I will agree.  I'm not there yet. :)
2010-09-20T01:06:03  <Cyndre> because you cant win in that small ammount of turns
2010-09-20T01:06:28  <Cyndre> say turn 50 they are ahead by 300 ships and on turn 100 you catch them in a mistake and get 1 more growthRate per turn - pointless
2010-09-20T01:06:30  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i'm not arguing about the number at all
2010-09-20T01:06:41  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i want a larger turn limit too
2010-09-20T01:06:50  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: as long as there *is* one
2010-09-20T01:06:51  <McLeopold> Cyndre: it might come down to having to take more risk the choose the slow but sure way.

2010-09-20T04:31:23  <antimatroid1> good luck making a game tree that does anything useful
2010-09-20T04:33:25  <rwa> antimatroid1:  I think our bots are thinking along similar lines.  But your implementation looks better so far.
2010-09-20T04:35:23  <antimatroid1> i'm still playing around with parameters, then i need to clean everything up
2010-09-20T04:35:49  <antimatroid1> it's still largely heuristic based, i'm finding it hard to work out how best to use anything beyond that without refining my heuristics better
2010-09-20T04:37:53  <rwa> It seems doubtful that you'll find much rigorous "solving" in this game.
2010-09-20T04:38:11  <antimatroid1> i don't doubt the winner will have some nice little trick (or quite a few) though

2010-09-20T07:54:51  <antimatroid1> how's your bot going?
2010-09-20T07:54:58  <antimatroid1> i've made some decent improvements today i think
2010-09-20T07:55:25  <retybok> grrr! I make some improvements too, only to find out others have improved even more :-D
2010-09-20T07:55:47  <bartwe_> the .10 so far is sucking
2010-09-20T07:56:04  <bartwe_> but it has clear potential in my eyes still
2010-09-20T07:56:12  <bartwe_> but i need better tooling to find a few bugs

2010-09-20T08:02:01  <delt0r_> bartwe_: It would be easy to do. Save games are just short hand game states... and not all that short hand either
2010-09-20T08:02:45  <bartwe_> hmz, how would it be to adjust the gamestate reader to accept both ?
2010-09-20T08:03:23  <delt0r_> I just use 2 different method. The save games do use a stupid mix of delimiters
2010-09-20T08:04:07  <delt0r_> the first bit is full planets with commas between values and : between planets ending with a |
2010-09-20T08:05:24  <delt0r_> then each planet is a tuple as so: owner.ships,owner.ships,......,owner.ships.source.destination.totalTurns.turnsleft

2010-09-20T09:20:27  <dhartmei> the only way distance() would return 0 is when the two planets have the same coordinates, the generator doesn't produce that, it explicitely checks minimum distance

2010-09-20T09:28:35  <antimatroid1> wait, are we guaranteed distances are going to be at least 2?
2010-09-20T09:28:39  <kcn1700> I've also prepared that case... oh well. I should go for update my bot.
2010-09-20T09:28:50  <antimatroid1> i set mine up in a more complicated way under teh assumption d=1 might happen
2010-09-20T09:29:19  <dhartmei> look at the generator code, it checks for a minimum distance according to growth

2010-09-20T12:31:42  <rogue780> 0 based indexing always ends up confusing me
2010-09-20T12:32:52  <kcn1700> that is very intuitive way of numbering, isn't it?
2010-09-20T12:33:16  <Naktibalda> countries with "ground floor" should be used to it
2010-09-20T12:33:39  <kcn1700> countries with C language should be used to it :-)
2010-09-20T12:34:02  <Naktibalda> Unixland probably :)
2010-09-20T12:35:00  <delt0r> here in Austria the first floor can be anything from the ground floor to about 3 stories up
2010-09-20T12:35:05  <rogue780> it's a good system, until you have to mix it with non-zero based numbering. then I get confused. "did I remember to subtract one? did I subtract one only once? when I'm comparing these numbers to this other number, are they both zero-based?"
2010-09-20T12:35:47  <kcn1700> set theory always starts from introducing natural numbers from 0

2010-09-20T13:29:28  <McLeopold> what have you discovered so far?
2010-09-20T13:29:59  <kcn1700> I had discovered that there needs some search techniques..

2010-09-20T13:30:10  <kcn1700> but I just did it with only shallow depth of search,
2010-09-20T13:30:29  <kcn1700> so running time is just about 0 cpu time...
2010-09-20T13:30:44  <McLeopold> so, like you're using an alpha/beta or something?
2010-09-20T13:31:05  <kcn1700> something like that... maybe.
2010-09-20T13:31:09  <McLeopold> interesting, mine is also very fast and doesn't try and predict anything
2010-09-20T13:31:15  <kcn1700> eh... and about center planets...
2010-09-20T13:31:56  <kcn1700> must take the center planet later... if growth rate of both players are same ...
2010-09-20T13:32:06  <McLeopold> I haven't made up my mind about center planets yet.  They seem like bait.
2010-09-20T13:32:27  <Zannick> the center planet is how copybot most often wins
2010-09-20T13:32:28  <McLeopold> Unless you can steal them. :)
2010-09-20T13:32:44  <kcn1700> yes.. I think so too. a player who gets that planet first will get loss point. must focus on stealing~
2010-09-20T13:33:05  <kcn1700> And actually my current running bot is not accumulating ships optimally...
2010-09-20T13:33:30  <McLeopold> Your current bot looks like a beehive. :)
2010-09-20T13:33:44  <kcn1700> yeah... too much waste on moving...
2010-09-20T13:34:02  <kcn1700> and there are some ships thrown away in very center of my planet area.
2010-09-20T13:34:06  <kcn1700> it's not good also ....
2010-09-20T13:34:46  <McLeopold> I've noticed a few bots that build faster than me, but then send a sizable fleet across the whole board.
2010-09-20T13:34:58  <McLeopold> Usually by the time it lands, I've already turned the game.
2010-09-20T13:35:25  <kcn1700> that was really impressive when I saw your matches.
2010-09-20T13:36:58  <McLeopold> Fast growth is winning right now, but I think the winner of this contest is going to be the bot with the best positioning.
2010-09-20T13:37:06  <danielvf> And fast growth
2010-09-20T13:37:15  <McLeopold> Well, yes, both.
2010-09-20T13:37:24  <danielvf> *nods*
2010-09-20T13:37:26  <McLeopold> I hope the finals are all new maps.

2010-09-20T13:38:33  <danielvf> I guessing the finals will have a new set of randomly generated maps

2010-09-20T13:39:52  <mega1> it can be that there is some overfitting already
2010-09-20T13:40:00  <mega1> what was the trouble with random maps?
2010-09-20T13:40:04  <kcn1700> lol. sending rage bot is really good.
2010-09-20T13:40:19  <mega1> that they are often uninteresting?
2010-09-20T13:40:44  <kcn1700> actually defensive bots are taking advantages for map 30.
2010-09-20T13:41:09  <kcn1700> but 30 s**ks
2010-09-20T13:41:29  <McLeopold> I've beat someone on map 30 in 14 turns. :)  No defense.

2010-09-20T13:42:05  <McLeopold> It was the tcp server, so I think it is gone.

2010-09-20T13:44:43  <kcn1700> but attacking opp's planets doesn't change the difference.
2010-09-20T13:45:34  <kcn1700> however, attacking defensive opp's is not good, because you lose controls of the ships after sending.

2010-09-20T13:47:50  <jmcarthur> although i would also still like to see some manually made maps

2010-09-20T13:49:05  <danielvf> dwchandler: Yeah, once we get some more servers up and playing bots, I may play on TCP again.
2010-09-20T13:49:26  <jmcarthur> i want to see weird stuff, like a perfect circle of planets surrounding a single high-yield planet in the center
2010-09-20T13:49:38  <a1k0n> or starting out with active fleets 100 turns away
2010-09-20T13:49:53  <a1k0n> might require some spec violations to achieve that
2010-09-20T13:49:54  <kcn1700> is there anyone who is building ranking history or sth useful info?
2010-09-20T13:50:20  <justin_pdx> Couldn't you just write your own map for that, a1k0n?
2010-09-20T13:50:24  <jmcarthur> the spec doesn't say anything about starting fleets or distances
2010-09-20T13:50:27  <justin_pdx> At least to play against demobots?
2010-09-20T13:50:27  <Zannick> i dislike the idea of incoming ships for an official map
2010-09-20T13:50:42  <Zannick> but only because i optimized to assume turn 1 has no fleets
2010-09-20T13:51:04  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-20T13:51:16  <jmcarthur> i like the idea of strange scenarios
2010-09-20T13:51:17  <a1k0n> justin_pdx: well yes of course, we're just talking about more interesting maps on the server
2010-09-20T13:51:29  <jmcarthur> as long as they are fairly balanced for both players
2010-09-20T13:51:41  <McLeopold> If I can get a good copy of the tcp server, I'd put up a strange map server.
2010-09-20T13:52:03  <kcn1700> that 'd be great
2010-09-20T13:52:39  <jmcarthur> i also want to have some degenerate maps, like a map that has only three or four planets counting home planets
2010-09-20T13:52:47  <justin_pdx> Ooh, I like the idea of incoming ships.  Maybe a growth 20 planet that has a fleet of 200 neutral ships crashing into it every 20 turns.
2010-09-20T13:53:04  <a1k0n> haha a fleet of neutral ships would totally break everyone's bot
2010-09-20T13:53:07  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-20T13:53:11  <McLeopold> neutral fleets?  that brilliant
2010-09-20T13:53:14  <kcn1700> that's an disaster. wow.
2010-09-20T13:53:19  <jmcarthur> my bot would die
2010-09-20T13:53:24  <a1k0n> assertion failed
2010-09-20T13:53:27  <kcn1700> s/an/a
2010-09-20T13:53:29  <jmcarthur> it assumes fleets are players
2010-09-20T13:53:32  <Zannick> hahaha, no that would be easy
2010-09-20T13:53:43  <Zannick> every 20 turns = 400 ships
2010-09-20T13:53:49  <jmcarthur> err, wait, no, this latest version makes no such assumption actually
2010-09-20T13:53:57  <Zannick> just take it before it gets too many ships
2010-09-20T13:53:58  <justin_pdx> Maybe a fleet of 1000 neutral ships that targets the highest population planets.
2010-09-20T13:54:06  <justin_pdx> And just bounces around till it dies.
2010-09-20T13:54:15  <a1k0n> that'd be a server tweak
2010-09-20T13:54:17  <Zannick> justin_pdx: at that point i'd stop calling it neutral ;)
2010-09-20T13:54:31  <McLeopold> neutral growth?
2010-09-20T13:54:37  <kcn1700> neutral growh...
2010-09-20T13:54:44  <kcn1700> we'll never be able to take them.
2010-09-20T13:54:49  <a1k0n> someone should hack up a server to do a 4v4 battle where each bot assumes its three opponents are all the same guy
2010-09-20T13:54:52  <a1k0n> just to see what happens
2010-09-20T13:55:00  <ntroPi> yea neutral just growing but doing nothing ... very interesting.
2010-09-20T13:55:00  <justin_pdx> Planets that orbit a sun.
2010-09-20T13:55:09  <McLeopold> re-enforcements would be weird.

2010-09-20T13:55:22  <kcn1700> orbitting lol.
2010-09-20T13:55:27  <jmcarthur> justin_pdx: getting complicated :P
2010-09-20T13:55:27  <McLeopold> the distance between planets would change
2010-09-20T13:55:32  <Zannick> do not want moving planets D:
2010-09-20T13:55:40  <jmcarthur> i think moving planets would be cool
2010-09-20T13:55:44  <justin_pdx> Yeah, or maybe just one planet, like a comet that flies around.
2010-09-20T13:55:54  <kcn1700> ships collide to move planets.
2010-09-20T13:55:59  <McLeopold> Does anyone remember solar wars?
2010-09-20T13:56:14  <McLeopold> or Spaceward Ho!
2010-09-20T13:56:21  <kcn1700> or how about 3d planet war.

2010-09-20T13:56:53  <McLeopold> solar wars had planets rotating a sun.  you had to orbit your fleets as well and sometimes the took forever to catch up
2010-09-20T13:57:21  <danielvf> Spaceward Ho! had fun with that
2010-09-20T13:57:56  <McLeopold> The visualizer needs to draw planets with cowboy hats and send shark and dog fleets around
2010-09-20T13:58:19  <ntroPi> obviously
2010-09-20T13:59:26  <Zannick> and 1-ship fleets should be fireflys?
2010-09-20T14:00:57  <McLeopold> 3 dimensional maps might be fun, but probably not much different from 2d
2010-09-20T14:01:25  <jmcarthur> our maps aren't perfectly 2D as it is considering the rounding
2010-09-20T14:01:39  <jmcarthur> i mean, we specify them in 2D but in practice they are not 2D
2010-09-20T14:01:43  <McLeopold> I never thought of it that way.
2010-09-20T14:02:11  <rogue780> McLeopold, you've been on top for a while now
2010-09-20T14:02:26  <McLeopold> yeah, but I just had 2 big losses

2010-09-20T14:02:54  <kcn1700> 105 games
2010-09-20T14:02:59  <kcn1700> 98 wins
2010-09-20T14:03:08  <McLeopold> I think that is more the fact that there aren't enough games
2010-09-20T14:03:16  <kcn1700> it's awesome.
2010-09-20T14:03:21  <McLeopold> My high elo, that is.
2010-09-20T14:04:17  <rogue780> OK, so for those of you who weren't here last night, I'm starting a coding contest site that will hold contests year-round
2010-09-20T14:04:25  <rogue780> it will be www.codeolympics.com
2010-09-20T14:04:41  <McLeopold> Please don't do that to me...
2010-09-20T14:04:47  <ntroPi> ^^
2010-09-20T14:04:57  <Zannick> haha
2010-09-20T14:05:00  <rogue780> aside from AI contests, there will be other kinds of coding challenges as well
2010-09-20T14:05:13  <McLeopold> Like project euler?
2010-09-20T14:05:31  <kcn1700> does anyone know topcoder?
2010-09-20T14:05:35  <rogue780> a bit, yes, but unlike project euler, there will be a lifespan of contests and declared winners
2010-09-20T14:05:48  <ntroPi> i started euler :-) but with scheme to have something to do in the new language.
2010-09-20T14:06:12  <ntroPi> but euler has to wait until this contest is done :-D
2010-09-20T14:06:27  <rogue780> there might be a 72hr game challenge, a under5k challenge, those kinds of things
2010-09-20T14:07:10  <HakanD> good idea (:
2010-09-20T14:07:23  <rogue780> anyway, I'm looking for anyone who might be interested in helping me run it. It would all be not for profit and all proceeds that we may get that go above operating costs could be donated to charities such as Childsplay

2010-09-20T16:40:28  <ntroPi> quite simple so far. Calculating the future state for all planets to get good targets and roughly the right amount of ships to send there.
2010-09-20T16:40:57  <ntroPi> little sorting and a crazy value function ... thats it so far.
2010-09-20T16:41:57  <shul> value function == "heuristic function" , look it up :)
2010-09-20T16:42:39  <ntroPi> yea heuristic :-)
2010-09-20T16:42:54  <ntroPi> i guess its about elo 0 on tcp
2010-09-20T16:43:41  <ntroPi> and on main site it definetly is much better than my previous attempt. Who knows where :-)

2010-09-20T17:06:01  <delt0r___> well last I used them (about 1.5 years ago) --they where as fast if not faster... I was upgrading a C app to C++
2010-09-20T17:06:07  <Zannick> i like using ** instead of nesting vectors
2010-09-20T17:06:13  <delt0r___> we got significant performance imporvments
2010-09-20T17:06:41  <delt0r___> We put it down to the fact that the compiler has more to work with than * or ***** ;)
2010-09-20T17:07:01  <delt0r___> performance wasn't the goal btw
2010-09-20T17:09:01  <Zannick> vectors are basically arrays with extra stuff
2010-09-20T17:09:39  <Zannick> i'm not sure how to get a performance improvement by using them
2010-09-20T17:09:42  <Zannick> but if you did, great
2010-09-20T17:10:02  <aerique> My previous was a fix for compiling Common Lisp submissions (which don't work atm).
2010-09-20T17:10:04  <delt0r___> Thats was our thoughts too... Like i said... we didn't do it for performance
2010-09-20T17:12:24  <Zannick> maybe you were doing really painful things with the base arrays in c :P
2010-09-20T17:12:47  <delt0r___> the c wasn't too bad.. quite readable...
2010-09-20T17:13:00  <delt0r___> but as i recall its wasn't anything too specail
2010-09-20T17:13:20  <Zannick> but anyway
2010-09-20T17:14:02  <delt0r___> I would (and was) be surprised of any big performance differences

2010-09-20T17:55:24  <rogue780> though, I'll probably screw it up in 6 months

2010-09-20T18:24:12  <antimatroid1> just woke up
2010-09-20T18:24:45  <drewrobb> my bot is still just a bunch of monkey patches
2010-09-20T18:24:55  <antimatroid1> i think most peoples are
2010-09-20T18:25:03  <Snowplan> Just programing a bot and was thinking is there a project for a 3d galcon cause that would be cool
2010-09-20T18:25:06  <antimatroid1> i keep cleaining, hacking, hacking, cleaning, etc.
2010-09-20T18:25:11  <jmcarthur> my bot is literally patched with monkeys
2010-09-20T18:25:18  <antimatroid1> snowplan: wouldn't really be any different

2010-09-20T18:25:25  <jmcarthur> literally
2010-09-20T18:25:29  <jmcarthur> there are monkeys in my bot
2010-09-20T18:25:31  <bartwe> i should sick peta on you
2010-09-20T18:25:39  <jmcarthur> that's how it's going to be so smart
2010-09-20T18:25:42  <bartwe> thinning the competition
2010-09-20T18:25:43  <jmcarthur> monkeys
2010-09-20T18:25:52  <drewrobb> amazingly, i just forbid it from sending anyting over a distance of 20, this caused it to beat its old self %90 of the time
2010-09-20T18:26:00  <jmcarthur> ha
2010-09-20T18:26:15  <Snowplan> well no I guess in the beggining not so much but to see some progression and where it would lead would be cool
2010-09-20T18:26:17  <jmcarthur> and suddenly there is a map where the minimum distance between planets is 20
2010-09-20T18:26:25  <antimatroid1> i have a terrible little hack trying to not take neutrals when we can't back that
2010-09-20T18:26:30  <antimatroid1> it's difficult to handle

2010-09-20T18:27:44  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'm getting towards the point where i'll have to start trying those things
2010-09-20T18:28:17  <drewrobb> yeah same here
2010-09-20T18:28:30  <bartwe> bugs are causing problems so far
2010-09-20T18:28:33  <antimatroid1> how would 3d galcon be any different?
2010-09-20T18:28:49  <antimatroid1> it would be for tron, but any 3d map for this you could essentially compress into 2d
2010-09-20T18:28:51  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: distances are not "planer"
2010-09-20T18:28:51  <Snowplan> I just think it would be cool to see the little triangles flying through 3d and having a
2010-09-20T18:28:53  <rogue780> antimatroid1, it would have a z axis
2010-09-20T18:29:02  <Snowplan> cool way to look at it
2010-09-20T18:29:18  <antimatroid1> maybe cool to look at, but actual gameplay would be no different
2010-09-20T18:29:22  <Snowplan> your right
2010-09-20T18:29:37  <Snowplan> just thinking it could evolve
2010-09-20T18:29:39  <delt0r___> however i would "complicate" things a bit more and have different types of ships.. fast or tough
2010-09-20T18:29:47  <antimatroid1> now nd tron would be cool
2010-09-20T18:29:56  <dwchandler> hmm. central planets would have 1 more dimension to be central in ;-)
2010-09-20T18:30:21  <dwchandler> but that wouldn't change strategy
2010-09-20T18:30:24  <drewrobb> you can't have 4 mutual equidistant planet in 2d
2010-09-20T18:30:26  <jmcarthur> i'm going to be doing search. i haven't even bothered with simpler bots yet. i went straight to this one
2010-09-20T18:30:42  <javagamer> drewrobb because of the rounding I believe you can
2010-09-20T18:30:46  <delt0r___> jmcarthur: is it working?
2010-09-20T18:30:51  <drewrobb> oh, right, the rounding
2010-09-20T18:30:52  <jmcarthur> still no
2010-09-20T18:30:57  <jmcarthur> it will be quite some time
2010-09-20T18:31:10  <delt0r___> what lang are you use jmcarthur ?
2010-09-20T18:31:15  <jmcarthur> well take a lot of tweaking and optimizations and finding the right parameters, and that's after it's written
2010-09-20T18:31:27  <jmcarthur> i'm using haskell, but this would be hard in any language IMO
2010-09-20T18:31:33  <delt0r___> true
2010-09-20T18:31:48  <delt0r___> haskell is nice... but i was never good at making it fast
2010-09-20T18:31:52  <jmcarthur> i also keep changing my idea

2010-09-20T18:32:05  <jmcarthur> well, another problem with haskell is the ghc version on the server
2010-09-20T18:32:11  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: i think it's worth playing around with heuristic like bots so you can see what does and doesn't work for your bot against the better bots
2010-09-20T18:32:37  <retybok_> antimatroid1: aren't all bots in this contest "heuristic"?
2010-09-20T18:32:49  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: i have some heuristics in mind to complement my search algorithm, but they would be pretty useless in isolation, actually
2010-09-20T18:34:03  <antimatroid1> retybok_: only for the moment
2010-09-20T18:34:06  <jmcarthur> i'm very seriously considering writing code that relies on GHC HEAD to run efficiently because i'm never going to get it to run efficiently with ghc 6.8.2 anyway, and i'll just hope we get nicer sandboxes so i can upload a binary
2010-09-20T18:34:38  <retybok_> jmcarthur: is using haskell really worth it in that case?
2010-09-20T18:35:31  <jmcarthur> retybok_: still beats tweaking C code for the performance, IMO. i can get 90% of the speed of C for 50% of the work this way
2010-09-20T18:35:41  <dwchandler> 6.8.2? why so old?
2010-09-20T18:35:42  <jmcarthur> *of the speed of heavily optimized C, that is
2010-09-20T18:36:16  <delt0r___> heavily optimized C is often a asm block
2010-09-20T18:36:20  <jmcarthur> dwchandler: old version of ubuntu. newer ghc doesn't even build on it :(
2010-09-20T18:36:31  <dwchandler> ugh
2010-09-20T18:36:49  <jmcarthur> delt0r___: i actually considered disassembling a binary from ghc and trying to get it into a C file as inline assembler...
2010-09-20T18:36:57  <delt0r___> lol
2010-09-20T18:37:05  <retybok_> jmcarthur: if you really manage to do that with a real program, I must say it's pretty neat

2010-09-20T18:37:59  <jmcarthur> retybok_: are you talking about my assembler trick or my statement about efficiency vs development time?
2010-09-20T18:38:28  <Janzert> last contest they allowed precompiled python extension modules so I'm not sure why they don't allow binaries

2010-09-20T18:38:55  <jmcarthur> not allowing binaries is just silly paranoia

2010-09-20T18:39:02  <jmcarthur> i mean, the sandbox sucks either way
2010-09-20T18:39:28  <jmcarthur> i'm going to prod the mailing list about it again, actually
2010-09-20T18:40:10  <retybok_> jmcarthur: efficiency vs. development time. Although your assembler trick is quite neat too :)
2010-09-20T18:41:18  <dwchandler> jmcarthur: -ddump-cmm any use?
2010-09-20T18:41:46  <jmcarthur> retybok_: ah. yeah i've actually achieved productivity/efficiency tradeoffs close to those numbers in practice, but only through a bit more focus on the haskell than most would probably be willing (still less work than micro-optimizing C, just more work than most people writing haskell would want to do)
2010-09-20T18:42:04  <jmcarthur> dwchandler: not sure what i would do with Cmm. what that be helpful?

2010-09-20T19:01:41  <jmcarthur> i'm using vector for now, but if i can get some assurance that binaries are likely to be supported eventually then i can just go over to repa where i would be much happier

2010-09-20T19:04:29  <jmcarthur> cYmen: lots of bots are tested on the tcp server, yes
2010-09-20T19:04:32  <cYmen> haskell, lisp
2010-09-20T19:04:44  <jmcarthur> cYmen: ghc 6.8.2 is working already, and i think scheme is too
2010-09-20T19:04:46  <cYmen> esoteric in this case means awesome ;)
2010-09-20T19:04:55  <jmcarthur> dunno what flavor of scheme
2010-09-20T19:05:11  <jmcarthur> and i don't know about common lisp
2010-09-20T19:06:13  <pc> jmcarthur: isn't it Racket ?
2010-09-20T19:06:19  *** pc is now known as xvinyl
2010-09-20T19:06:29  <jmcarthur> cYmen: pretty much my workflow, once my bot is working at all, will be to test locally with the java engine (or one of these engines that have been posted to the forums), then test via tcp, then upload to the server for testing, where i am more critical of passing at each stage
2010-09-20T19:06:54  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: sounds right, but i don't know my schemes very well
2010-09-20T19:07:02  <Naktibalda> Hmm, these lazy admins haven't added new starter packages to site
2010-09-20T19:07:12  <jmcarthur> silly admins
2010-09-20T19:07:40  <xvinyl> it's a shame though, many languages are supported and most of them already have startup packages
2010-09-20T19:08:06  <jmcarthur> everybody on the mailing list, i would like your support on the binaries issue (if you actually support my proposal, of course)
2010-09-20T19:08:15  <xvinyl> I mean... most of hte job is already done on the admin's side
2010-09-20T19:09:49  <cYmen> jmcarthur: binary issue?
2010-09-20T19:10:42  <jmcarthur> cYmen: i'm trying to convince the maintainers/admins to allow arbitrary binaries for submission
2010-09-20T19:10:51  <sigh> I vote 1!
2010-09-20T19:11:05  <cYmen> jmcarthur: How do you propose they do that in a safe manner?
2010-09-20T19:11:17  <jmcarthur> cYmen: how do you think they are running the code already? ;)
2010-09-20T19:11:28  <cYmen> Well, I would use a bunch of vms. :)
2010-09-20T19:11:34  <jmcarthur> cYmen: i would too
2010-09-20T19:11:50  <jmcarthur> cYmen: they are not currently doing that (bad bad bad!), but it makes no difference whether the source is available either way
2010-09-20T19:11:55  <bartwe> hmz
2010-09-20T19:12:14  <bartwe> how would you guys model threat ? i now choose a full out everything the enemy has got attack
2010-09-20T19:12:18  <jmcarthur> cYmen: it's just a chroot with some strict resource caps and iptables settings right now
2010-09-20T19:12:37  <bartwe> which makes it so risk averse that it can't flank
2010-09-20T19:12:40  <sigh> bartwe: can you explain more clearly?
2010-09-20T19:12:46  <cYmen> mkay
2010-09-20T19:12:49  <jmcarthur> cYmen: well, and of course users with basically no privs
2010-09-20T19:13:29  <bartwe> sigh: when moving a fleet from A to B, i calculate the worstcase for both places. ie. the enemy sends everything, how much would my income be if i did, or did not send a force
2010-09-20T19:13:44  <bartwe> which makes it very cautious
2010-09-20T19:13:55  <sigh> bartwe: ahh, i see... atm, my bot only cares about incoming fleets... this makes it very aggressive
2010-09-20T19:14:04  <xvinyl> bartwe: that's very conservative indeed
2010-09-20T19:14:06  <sigh> and leaves big weaknesses :P
2010-09-20T19:14:07  <bartwe> however, an all out attack would be surely overcome
2010-09-20T19:14:33  <bartwe> maybe i should include an all-out defense too
2010-09-20T19:14:57  <sigh> what is an all-out defense?
2010-09-20T19:15:16  <bartwe> assume all my units move to the locations the enemy moves all his units to
2010-09-20T19:15:29  <sigh> wouldn't that lock all your planets if you have less ships
2010-09-20T19:15:31  <cYmen> all ships move outside the playfield because they are scared
2010-09-20T19:15:50  <jmcarthur> bartwe: i would consider the minimum time it takes for the enemy to send a minimal force large enough to overtake my forces at that planet before i can minimally defend it, i think. i wouldn't worry about an all out rush
2010-09-20T19:15:57  <bartwe> sigh: if you have less ships, and less growth, and that happens, you lose anyways
2010-09-20T19:16:03  <jmcarthur> but then, i haven't experimented with a heuristic-only bot at all
2010-09-20T19:16:19  <sigh> bartwe: plenty of games where a bot comes back from less ships and less growth
2010-09-20T19:16:19  <cYmen> where do you guys get your strategy ideas and such?
2010-09-20T19:16:20  <jmcarthur> ^^ accounting for growth i mean
2010-09-20T19:16:28  <jmcarthur> cYmen: from our heads!
2010-09-20T19:16:36  <sigh> cYmen: thinking, watching other bots, and talking in the channel
2010-09-20T19:16:40  <bartwe> jmcarthur: that is what the .8 series does, but i can't break the top ranks anymore
2010-09-20T19:17:11  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: yep, you need to planet trade when growth rates are advantageous
2010-09-20T19:17:46  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: otherwise the heuristic you gave is still too cautious
2010-09-20T19:17:53  <jmcarthur> xvinyl: you're right
2010-09-20T19:18:13  <jmcarthur> i should actually keep my mouth shut. you guys have thought a lot more about heuristics than i have
2010-09-20T19:18:48  <xvinyl> jmcarthur: i didn't write my bot yet :)
2010-09-20T19:19:12  <jmcarthur> nor i
2010-09-20T19:19:27  <sigh> jmcarthur: my heuristics are suprisingly stupid
2010-09-20T19:19:46  <jmcarthur> but my bot will be a searchbot with only some specialized heuristics for it. my heuristics wouldn't be applicable for a standalone bot
2010-09-20T19:19:53  <xvinyl> i'll have to learn to write correct Haskell first...
2010-09-20T19:20:33  <cYmen> hehe
2010-09-20T19:20:36  <dwchandler> Learn You A Haskell For Great Bots
2010-09-20T19:20:44  <xvinyl> lol yes
2010-09-20T19:20:57  <jmcarthur> it's hard to learn a language like haskell at the same time that you are trying to solve a difficult problem like this

2010-09-20T19:21:23  <xvinyl> well, i've been trying to learn Haskell for a few months now
2010-09-20T19:21:40  <xvinyl> just never had the opportunity to use it for a real project
2010-09-20T19:21:48  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-20T19:21:50  <jmcarthur> well good luck!
2010-09-20T19:21:56  <dwchandler> actually it's a great way to learn haskell, but time to get your bot going will be rather large
2010-09-20T19:22:00  <xvinyl> thanks :)
2010-09-20T19:22:19  <jmcarthur> dwchandler: sure. it's great for learning haskell, not for making a bot ;)
2010-09-20T19:22:29  <dwchandler> :)
2010-09-20T19:22:36  <xvinyl> well, we still have more than 2 months so...
2010-09-20T19:22:41  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-20T19:22:56  <xvinyl> meanwhile I can follow the latest strategies here :)
2010-09-20T19:23:05  <cYmen> hehe
2010-09-20T19:23:17  <cYmen> we should have bot explanation sessions :)
2010-09-20T19:23:28  <cYmen> everybody gets to present their bot to give the others ideas
2010-09-20T19:23:50  <jmcarthur> i shan't be revealing my strategies here! :P
2010-09-20T19:24:15  <sigh> jmcarthur: is your bot on tcp or the main site?
2010-09-20T19:24:31  <xvinyl> cYmen: on a somewhat related note, that's more or less what happened to the Netflix contest
2010-09-20T19:24:33  <jmcarthur> not done yet
2010-09-20T19:24:39  <jmcarthur> not *ready* yet i mean

2010-09-20T19:28:39  <jmcarthur> it was brilliant on netflix's part, too. they only had to spend a million on it not counting advertising and overhead
2010-09-20T19:28:40  <xvinyl> cYmen: in the end they used mixtures of the results given by several algorithms

2010-09-20T19:30:50  <jmcarthur> even if only as a batch job i think it was probably worth using
2010-09-20T19:31:04  <jmcarthur> 10% is a big number in the grand scheme of things
2010-09-20T19:31:08  <xvinyl> i think they mostly did this for the ideas their researchers could get off the submissions

2010-09-20T23:34:59  <jmcarthur> oh, there used to be

2010-09-20T23:41:30  <Snowplan> right now I'm working on trying to make it a real AI
2010-09-20T23:41:51  <Snowplan> something that can actually know what to do
2010-09-20T23:42:00  <Snowplan> road blocked
2010-09-20T23:42:03  <jmcarthur> bss03-AFK: no not yet
2010-09-20T23:42:21  <sigh> Snowplan: yeah, you got to try a bunch of stuff and see what works out
2010-09-20T23:42:30  <jmcarthur> my idea is complex
2010-09-20T23:42:49  <sigh> work in small steps, for example you might implement some simple defense if you haven't yet
2010-09-20T23:43:00  <sigh> the example bots have no defense in them
2010-09-20T23:43:51  <Snowplan> right, I mainly am working on strategy but my biggest flaw is sucking at programing.
2010-09-20T23:44:15  <sigh> ah well, this is a good opportunity to practice and get better :)
2010-09-20T23:44:16  <Snowplan> I'm using java
2010-09-20T23:44:27  <Snowplan> exactly
2010-09-20T23:45:49  <Snowplan> my sorting process sucks and it's ashame
2010-09-20T23:45:59  <sigh> sorting process?

2010-09-20T23:46:57  <Snowplan> yea I am not sorting my planets correct
2010-09-20T23:47:08  <Snowplan> nor other planets
2010-09-20T23:47:10  <bss03> I think I finally have a bot that is better than my last submission.. finally.
2010-09-20T23:47:25  <bss03> I kept making things more and more complex, and not really getting better -- or getting worse.
2010-09-20T23:47:30  <sigh> Snowplan: you mean to determine which planets are valuable?
2010-09-20T23:47:52  <Snowplan> right
2010-09-20T23:47:53  <bss03> Today I simpled a few things up, and it seems to be working out.
2010-09-20T23:48:36  <Snowplan> or which are vulnerable
2010-09-20T23:49:18  <sigh> Snowplan: yup, that is difficult, even the top bots have trouble with it
2010-09-20T23:49:26  <sigh> you just have to improve it bit by bit
2010-09-20T23:49:41  <Snowplan> also distance
2010-09-20T23:49:43  <sigh> try different things
2010-09-20T23:49:51  <Snowplan> thanks for the encouragement

2010-09-20T23:51:28  <sigh> bss03: yeah, keeping things simple is always a bonus, having a lot of special cases can be an indication you are missing the bigger picture
2010-09-20T23:53:21  <Snowplan> Any tips on the elo logic of it?
2010-09-20T23:53:32  <sigh> elo logic?
2010-09-20T23:53:46  <bss03> It wasn't that there was a lot of special cases, it was just trying to be "too" smart and missing the point.
2010-09-20T23:53:57  <bss03> My algorithms were too complex for what I was really trying to do.
2010-09-20T23:54:23  <sigh> bss03: yeah, I've come across that too :)
2010-09-20T23:56:01  <bss03> Snowplan: I assign a value to a planet based on it's growthRate * (# of turns) - shipsToConquer
2010-09-20T23:56:07  <jmcarthur> i hope that doesn't happen to me
2010-09-20T23:56:16  <jmcarthur> trying to be too smart, that is

2010-09-20T23:56:45  <bss03> Snowplan: I don't include distance directly in the calculation, but "# of turns" is decreased by the time it would take me to get shipsToConquer there.

2010-09-20T23:57:32  <bss03> Unfortunately, when I'm facing a good bot, shipsToConquer is always a gross underestimate the way I'm calculating it now. :(
2010-09-20T23:58:05  <Zarathust> Is it possible to check the PlayGame source?
2010-09-20T23:58:09  <sigh> Snowplan: also you might want to read this: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=593
2010-09-20T23:58:17  <sigh> it has a lot of good tips
2010-09-20T23:58:57  <bss03> Zarathust: You might check the Google Code project and see if it has the PlayGame source.
2010-09-20T23:59:37  <bss03> Zarathust: PlayGame.jar isn't used for it official engine though, IIRC.  ISTR the actuall engine is written in python.
2010-09-20T23:59:58  <Zarathust> where can I get it?
