2012-08-04T08:56:21  <UncleVasya> mcstar: http://ideone.com/91pm3
2012-08-04T08:56:36  <mcstar> the problem with these simple tasks, is that both our codes look almost identical
2012-08-04T08:56:47  <UncleVasya> yep
2012-08-04T08:56:59  <UncleVasya> Can you upload your test file?
2012-08-04T08:57:15  <mcstar> it is uploaded already
2012-08-04T08:57:30  <UncleVasya> OK, can you give me a ink? :)
2012-08-04T08:58:13  <mcstar> http://liquid-phynix.minus.com/lYwJXSlqce8sq
2012-08-04T08:58:29  <mcstar> it should work
2012-08-04T08:58:39  <mcstar> but sometimes there are problems with minus links
2012-08-04T09:00:01  <mcstar> it has unix file endings
2012-08-04T09:03:51  <UncleVasya> mcstar: http://ideone.com/pE0HA
2012-08-04T09:06:28  <UncleVasya> because first way creates a value of dataType and then creates from that value new one of type nodeType while second way creates nodeType immediately?
2012-08-04T09:06:58  <mcstar> thats the difference
2012-08-04T09:07:07  <mcstar> but that doesnt explain the speed difference
2012-08-04T09:07:33  <mcstar> there is something that ocamlopt cant optimize away, in the first version
2012-08-04T09:07:49  <mcstar> it is faster to fully construct a value of a type
2012-08-04T09:08:12  <mcstar> but i dont know the details, so i cant say for sure
2012-08-04T09:08:25  <mcstar> how much faster?
2012-08-04T09:09:20  <UncleVasya> 1073 vs 1250
2012-08-04T09:09:36  <UncleVasya> that's interpreter
2012-08-04T09:09:59  <UncleVasya> I didn't tested compiled second version yet.
2012-08-04T09:10:06  <UncleVasya> one sec
2012-08-04T09:10:15  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-04T09:10:24  <mcstar> you should always use ocamlopt
2012-08-04T09:10:29  <mcstar> if you are benchmarking
2012-08-04T09:10:40  <mcstar> it has totally different optimizational capabilities
2012-08-04T09:10:59  <UncleVasya> 422 first way

2012-08-04T09:11:28  <mcstar> this new version is slower then the first for me
2012-08-04T09:11:31  <mcstar> than*
2012-08-04T09:11:44  <UncleVasya> 406 second
2012-08-04T09:12:49  <mcstar> UncleVasya: try to find out, why does my version build the tree 2x faster than yours
2012-08-04T09:14:49  <UncleVasya> because your tree is mutable?
2012-08-04T09:15:18  <mcstar> lol
2012-08-04T09:15:22  <mcstar> yes
2012-08-04T09:15:24  <mcstar> the last one is
2012-08-04T09:15:26  <mcstar> i forgot
2012-08-04T09:16:36  <UncleVasya> btw, my lookup fnction doesn't need a maxi :p
2012-08-04T09:16:59  <UncleVasya> I hope :)
2012-08-04T09:17:18  <mcstar> yes it does
2012-08-04T09:17:22  <mcstar> len - 1
2012-08-04T09:17:24  <mcstar> == maxi
2012-08-04T09:17:38  <mcstar> btw
2012-08-04T09:17:45  <mcstar> id write i <> len-1
2012-08-04T09:18:02  <UncleVasya> I meant checking if i > maxi then false
2012-08-04T09:18:03  <mcstar> as i < len -1
2012-08-04T09:18:14  <mcstar> ah

2012-08-04T09:19:14  <mcstar> mine, immutable
2012-08-04T09:19:23  <mcstar> tiny bit faster :)
2012-08-04T09:20:33  <UncleVasya> Does your haskell version faster than the mutable one in OCaml?
2012-08-04T09:20:49  <mcstar> Is*
2012-08-04T09:20:56  <mcstar> i dont think so
2012-08-04T09:20:58  <mcstar> ill check
2012-08-04T09:23:04  <UncleVasya> I suppose yours is faster because you use foldl.
2012-08-04T09:24:27  <mcstar> mine fastest pure haskell one, takes all in all the same time
2012-08-04T09:24:40  <mcstar> but aorund 0.4s from that is runtime initialization i thnk
2012-08-04T09:24:41  <mcstar> think*
2012-08-04T09:24:47  <mcstar> so it is faster a bit
2012-08-04T09:25:01  <mcstar> UncleVasya: foldl?
2012-08-04T09:25:10  <UncleVasya> list iteration
2012-08-04T09:25:16  <mcstar> i dont use fold in inser/lookup
2012-08-04T09:25:29  <mcstar> and i use the same driving code for your functions as mine
2012-08-04T09:28:48  <UncleVasya> maybe use of word.[i] every time is slower than let c = word.[i] ? But let's stop thinking about this, I have another question :)
2012-08-04T09:29:47  <UncleVasya> as your haskell tree is fully immutable than it rebuilds every time you insert something?
2012-08-04T09:31:19  <mcstar> it is as much immutable as yours
2012-08-04T09:31:30  <mcstar> they do the same thing
2012-08-04T09:31:47  <mcstar> you too, rebuld that part of the tree, that your insert function traverses
2012-08-04T09:32:20  <mcstar> you dont use mutable record fields, references, arrays, or objects
2012-08-04T09:32:28  <mcstar> so that code is pure
2012-08-04T09:32:32  <mcstar> (except IO)
2012-08-04T09:35:58  <UncleVasya> I'm surprised that haskell immutable version is not slower then OCaml mutable. Why?
2012-08-04T09:36:26  <mcstar> it is slower
2012-08-04T09:36:45  <UncleVasya> OK
2012-08-04T09:38:09  <UncleVasya> I checked word.[i] vs let ch = word.[i]  -  same time
2012-08-04T09:38:31  <mcstar> i did that for readability
2012-08-04T09:42:18  <UncleVasya> let me see your immutable OCaml tree.
2012-08-04T09:43:02  <mcstar> only the insert function is different
2012-08-04T09:43:57  <mcstar> http://sprunge.us/REfW?ocaml
2012-08-04T09:43:59  <mcstar> UncleVasya: ^^
2012-08-04T09:46:17  <mcstar> UncleVasya: http://hpaste.org/72473
2012-08-04T09:46:50  <mcstar> thats an immutable haskell version, with a batch insert function, that works in the ST moand
2012-08-04T09:46:54  <mcstar> monad*
2012-08-04T09:47:09  <mcstar> it is sort of mutable, but when the tree is done, it becomes immutable
2012-08-04T09:47:36  <mcstar> anyway, it is slow, like 7 times slower than the original
2012-08-04T09:47:44  <mcstar> i have a long way to go with that oen
2012-08-04T09:48:56  <UncleVasya> sort of mutable, becomes immutable...  is pure or not?
2012-08-04T09:50:18  <UncleVasya> Heheh, I've stack overflow on your file.
2012-08-04T09:50:26  <UncleVasya> *I've got
2012-08-04T09:52:49  <mcstar> it is pure in a sense
2012-08-04T09:57:49  <UncleVasya> when you asked about stack overflow on #ocaml,  what was the answer?
2012-08-04T09:59:25  <mcstar> ill look at your code
2012-08-04T09:59:45  <mcstar> you probably are building up the input word list in a non tail recursive way
2012-08-04T09:59:52  <UncleVasya> no, don't waste time.
2012-08-04T10:01:54  <mcstar> (Str.split (Str.regexp "[, \t]+") head) @ strings_to_words tail
2012-08-04T10:02:03  <mcstar> you use append
2012-08-04T10:02:30  <mcstar> thats probably not a great idea to build a list
2012-08-04T10:02:41  <mcstar> you should use cons, ::
2012-08-04T10:02:49  <mcstar> and if needed, reverse the list
2012-08-04T10:03:10  <mcstar> line @ from_file file
2012-08-04T10:03:13  <mcstar> same here
2012-08-04T10:03:17  <UncleVasya> so this is the right time to start reading a book. To find out what the fold is and how to build list the right way :)
2012-08-04T10:04:06  <mcstar> and ofc, this isnt tail recursive at all
2012-08-04T10:04:13  <mcstar> but  your try/with is at the right place
2012-08-04T10:04:34  <mcstar> UncleVasya: you build lists the right way, exactly as you decosntruct them
2012-08-04T10:04:46  <mcstar> head :: tail
2012-08-04T10:05:17  <UncleVasya> after split function i have a list of strings
2012-08-04T10:05:28  <mcstar> UncleVasya: and probably, it is better to use an option type, than a list for failure
2012-08-04T10:06:09  <UncleVasya> This is dirty Russian code, baby! :D
2012-08-04T10:08:12  <mcstar> in this case, the problem isnt that great
2012-08-04T10:08:22  <mcstar> only the first part of the list is copied
2012-08-04T10:08:26  <mcstar> up until @
2012-08-04T10:09:18  <mcstar> strings_to_words tail @ (Str.split (Str.regexp "[, \t]+") head) would be far worse
2012-08-04T10:10:35  <mcstar> UncleVasya: anyway, you will have to write from_file and strings_to_words tail recursively
2012-08-04T10:11:07  <mcstar> or use a fold
2012-08-04T10:11:28  <mcstar> afaik fold_left in stdlib is tail recursive
2012-08-04T10:21:06  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i recommend this book
2012-08-04T10:21:08  <mcstar> http://pauillac.inria.fr/cousineau-mauny/
2012-08-04T10:21:42  <mcstar> (they recommended it to me, seems solid, with code, and focuses on caml/ocaml)
2012-08-04T10:22:24  <UncleVasya> thanks
2012-08-04T10:25:01  <mcstar> UncleVasya: stop this stopspam message bullshit

2012-08-04T10:37:30  <UncleVasya> btw, mcstar, haven't you seen nice cheatsheets for OCaml from Jane Street? Like http://camlunity.ru/files/cheatsheets/ocaml-lang.pdf

2012-08-04T11:45:30  <mcstar> btw, i dont remember him saying he likes it
2012-08-04T11:45:34  <mcstar> i read the logs though

2012-08-04T11:46:32  <antimatroid> when correcting teh english
2012-08-04T11:46:33  <UncleVasya> his word was 'clear' :)
2012-08-04T11:46:56  <UncleVasya> I understood it as 'love! love! love!'
2012-08-04T11:47:05  <mcstar> i were offline?
2012-08-04T11:47:09  <mcstar> ah i see
2012-08-04T11:47:28  <mcstar> (haha, some more grammatical errors for antimatroid)
2012-08-04T11:49:31  <mleise> remember the day when we found out how bass is pronounced?
2012-08-04T11:50:08  <mcstar> yeah
2012-08-04T11:50:35  <mcstar> (i long for those great times...)
2012-08-04T11:50:46  <mcstar> we were innocent
2012-08-04T11:50:54  <mcstar> we thought, we could change the world
2012-08-04T11:50:59  <mcstar> make it a better place
2012-08-04T11:51:03  <mcstar> little did we know
2012-08-04T12:07:49  <mcstar> mleise: so you want to finish?
2012-08-04T12:07:54  <mcstar> or is that all?
2012-08-04T12:07:58  <mcstar> do*
2012-08-04T12:08:45  <antimatroid> i missed that
2012-08-04T12:08:52  <antimatroid> you didn't know it was pronounced base?
2012-08-04T12:08:57  <antimatroid> how do you pronounce Euler?
2012-08-04T12:08:59  <antimatroid> oiler i hope
2012-08-04T12:10:32  <mcstar> pfff
2012-08-04T12:10:35  <mcstar> dont troll
2012-08-04T12:10:35  <mleise> mcstar: ^^ you nailed it
2012-08-04T12:11:05  <mcstar> ok...im not sure what did nail
2012-08-04T12:11:11  <mcstar> but its good that i nailed something
2012-08-04T12:11:18  <mcstar> been a long time i nailed something

2012-08-04T12:53:57  <UncleVasya> what's the difference with Some?
2012-08-04T12:54:46  <mcstar> you dont give back the line in a list
2012-08-04T12:54:55  <mcstar> so you dont have to use @
2012-08-04T12:55:05  <mcstar> use :: when you construct a list
2012-08-04T12:56:11  <UncleVasya> wow, I didn't managed to make line :: lst work and you did :)
2012-08-04T12:56:26  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-04T12:58:05  <UncleVasya> now I think I understand why that didn't work:  with [] -> []  ocaml tought that line is a list, not a string.
2012-08-04T12:58:14  <UncleVasya> *wall*
2012-08-04T12:59:11  <mcstar> line == [input_line file]
2012-08-04T12:59:13  <mcstar> in your case
2012-08-04T12:59:17  <mcstar> line WAS a list
2012-08-04T12:59:23  <mcstar> a one element list
2012-08-04T12:59:47  <mcstar> but lst was a list of strings
2012-08-04T12:59:52  <mcstar> and lists are homohenous
2012-08-04T13:00:08  <mcstar> so you cant cons a [string] to a [string]
2012-08-04T13:00:16  <mcstar> only a string to a [string]

2012-08-04T13:19:47  <mcstar> UncleVasya: :)
2012-08-04T13:19:51  <mcstar> why did you do that?
2012-08-04T13:20:11  <UncleVasya> To exclude @-s :)
2012-08-04T13:20:12  <mcstar> strings_to_words was already tail recursive
2012-08-04T13:20:23  <mcstar> yeah, but in that case you shouldnt
2012-08-04T13:20:33  <mcstar> split already gaves a list of strings
2012-08-04T13:20:38  <mcstar> so it is natural to use append
2012-08-04T13:20:47  <mcstar> gave*
2012-08-04T13:21:30  <mcstar> UncleVasya: as i said, when you do: lst1 @ lst2, then lst1 is copied element by element
2012-08-04T13:21:35  <mcstar> i.e. it is reconstructed
2012-08-04T13:21:39  <mcstar> but lst2 isnt
2012-08-04T13:21:50  <mcstar> lst3 = lst1 @ lst2
2012-08-04T13:22:00  <mcstar> now lst3 shares its tail with lst2
2012-08-04T13:22:10  <mcstar> only lst1 is copied
2012-08-04T13:22:41  <mcstar> when lst1 is long, or it is the list that grows(for example in a recursive call) thats when it represents a problem
2012-08-04T13:22:58  <mcstar> since appending is an O(n) operation, where n is the length of the first list
2012-08-04T13:24:58  <UncleVasya> but second version is 300-500 ms faster in interpreter (no difference if compiled).
2012-08-04T13:26:26  <mcstar> ok
2012-08-04T13:26:36  <UncleVasya> but thanks for explanation, i'll try to remember
2012-08-04T13:31:35  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2012-08-04T13:40:48  <mcstar> UncleVasya: 300-500ms is the absolute difference, but how much is the relative
2012-08-04T13:40:50  <mcstar> ?
2012-08-04T13:49:19  <UncleVasya> ~ 12700 vs 13200
2012-08-04T13:50:40  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-04T13:50:40  <UncleVasya> even 13400
2012-08-04T13:50:47  <mcstar> so nothing basically
2012-08-04T13:51:15  <mcstar> there are huge fluctuations compared to the absolute difference
2012-08-04T13:51:25  <mcstar> and the relative one is low
2012-08-04T13:51:39  <mcstar> so, theres not much difference after all
2012-08-04T13:52:37  <mcstar> what matters is thet they are the same with ocamlopt
2012-08-04T13:52:45  <mcstar> or roughly the same
2012-08-04T13:52:53  <UncleVasya> yep, but the difference is repeatable (not an accident) :p
2012-08-04T13:53:19  <mcstar> yeah, but the standard deviation is great
2012-08-04T13:53:59  <UncleVasya> you're right

2012-08-04T15:19:47  <mcstar> do you know about this article?
2012-08-04T15:19:56  <mcstar> nature article from 88
2012-08-04T15:19:59  <delt0r> no
2012-08-04T15:20:37  <mcstar> its about a bacteria culture, they have a genetic defect
2012-08-04T15:20:54  <mcstar> they dont hace the genes to produce lactase, to metabolize lactose
2012-08-04T15:20:57  <mcstar> have*
2012-08-04T15:21:21  <mcstar> the authors put these cultures in dishes, they put lactose in it too
2012-08-04T15:21:39  <delt0r> Oh yea.. i know the experiment...
2012-08-04T15:21:41  <mcstar> and contraray to what they were expecting, the bacterial culture started to grow
2012-08-04T15:21:50  <delt0r> its been done quite a few times now in different settings..
2012-08-04T15:21:55  <mcstar> ah
2012-08-04T15:22:02  <mcstar> ok, can you tell me something about this?
2012-08-04T15:22:10  <mcstar> how well understood is this process?
2012-08-04T15:22:13  <delt0r> my new boss even did and experiment similar in yeast
2012-08-04T15:22:16  <mcstar> and what is going on at all?
2012-08-04T15:22:24  <mcstar> haha
2012-08-04T15:22:36  <delt0r> They expected it too grow... well at least I would
2012-08-04T15:22:43  <mcstar> no
2012-08-04T15:22:57  <mcstar> they couldnt eat the energy source
2012-08-04T15:23:12  <mcstar> how would they grow/multiply if they cant metabolize lactose?
2012-08-04T15:23:35  <mcstar> and the bacteria apparently fixed their genes
2012-08-04T15:24:16  <delt0r> Well how many did they start with
2012-08-04T15:24:22  <delt0r> clearly if they are dead they are dead
2012-08-04T15:24:24  <mcstar> i havent read the article yet
2012-08-04T15:24:38  <delt0r> however bactieria have  a *lot* of pathways to use things
2012-08-04T15:24:47  <mcstar> i was watching a talk, in which the speaker referred to this article
2012-08-04T15:24:53  <mcstar> ill read it later
2012-08-04T15:25:05  <delt0r> so it may be not efficenet to start with... but then it mutates and bobs your uncle
2012-08-04T15:25:36  <delt0r> Note that i can't just have 100% pure lactase
2012-08-04T15:25:40  <mcstar> but for the bacteria to mutate, it needs to produce offsprings, dont it?
2012-08-04T15:25:44  * UncleVasya is scared
2012-08-04T15:25:49  <delt0r> yea
2012-08-04T15:26:12  <delt0r> so? like i said... it must still have a media that it can survive on...
2012-08-04T15:26:13  <mcstar> what i was suspecting, is that the original selection of bacteria wasnt 100% percise
2012-08-04T15:26:53  <delt0r> the standard experiment is that you have mostly one or the other (glucose/lactase)
2012-08-04T15:27:06  <delt0r> but there needs to be a few other things as well...
2012-08-04T15:27:12  <mcstar> how long before a bacteria dies if theres no fuel around?
2012-08-04T15:27:23  <mcstar> does it have some surplus energy?
2012-08-04T15:27:26  <delt0r> life... all life really needs quite a lot of different things to work
2012-08-04T15:27:34  <delt0r> mcstar: depends, most do
2012-08-04T15:27:39  <delt0r> quite a bit sometimes
2012-08-04T15:27:48  <mcstar> in mitochondia?
2012-08-04T15:27:52  <mcstar> mitochondria
2012-08-04T15:27:56  <delt0r> they can often enter a "hibernation" state
2012-08-04T15:28:09  <delt0r> no.. lipids... fats... in the cell
2012-08-04T15:28:44  <delt0r> but it depends on what it is... ecoli for example just has pathways to do just about anything
2012-08-04T15:28:45  <mcstar> anyway, the conlusion of the article, is that mutation is not random
2012-08-04T15:28:59  <delt0r> well mutation is random... selection is not
2012-08-04T15:29:06  <mcstar> yeah, it was ecoli
2012-08-04T15:29:27  <delt0r> and there is selection on mechanisms of mutation
2012-08-04T15:30:10  <mcstar> delt0r: what i want to know, basically, whether or not this article is still considered heresy
2012-08-04T15:31:00  <mcstar> it supposes a mechanism, that external conditions can affect genetic change
2012-08-04T15:31:06  <delt0r> no as far as i know... nature/science papers tend to be "tabloid" science...
2012-08-04T15:31:15  <mcstar> and i dont mean high energy radiation or the like
2012-08-04T15:31:28  <delt0r> lots of fanfar and often rather sensationlized headlines
2012-08-04T15:32:07  <mcstar> well, arent those articles published elsewhere too? in more specialized journals?
2012-08-04T15:32:21  <delt0r> well one thing people forget is that a simple bacteria is *not* simple... it is a really complicated piece of machinery..
2012-08-04T15:32:29  <delt0r> mcstar: yes...
2012-08-04T15:32:36  <delt0r> typically more complete as well
2012-08-04T15:35:23  <mcstar> delt0r: on a sidenote, how much do you know about colloid suspensions?
2012-08-04T15:35:41  <delt0r> not so much...
2012-08-04T15:36:05  <mcstar> ive been reading some papers, it has relevance on what im doing
2012-08-04T15:36:25  <mcstar> i came across some controvery, so to speak
2012-08-04T15:36:25  <delt0r> colloid are like fluids through poreris media..
2012-08-04T15:36:35  <mcstar> poreris?
2012-08-04T15:36:38  <delt0r> pories
2012-08-04T15:36:40  <delt0r> shit
2012-08-04T15:36:44  <delt0r> sponge
2012-08-04T15:37:08  <delt0r> soaking and wetting behaviors
2012-08-04T15:37:15  <mcstar> hm
2012-08-04T15:37:24  <mcstar> not really
2012-08-04T15:37:47  <mcstar> colloids are particles, orders of magniute bigger than the solution they are in
2012-08-04T15:37:52  <delt0r> well last i heard the outside layer on the particles in a colloid are rather important
2012-08-04T15:38:01  <mcstar> no
2012-08-04T15:38:04  <delt0r> add a surfactant
2012-08-04T15:38:05  <mcstar> those are vesicles
2012-08-04T15:38:48  <mcstar> a colloids are just really, hard spheres, if they are uncharged
2012-08-04T15:39:23  <delt0r> really? I am a bit doubtful .
2012-08-04T15:39:38  <mcstar> but often they are charged, and they mimick real particles under certain circumstances
2012-08-04T15:39:51  <mcstar> like, you can study solidification, nucleation with them
2012-08-04T15:40:10  <delt0r> The only time i got interested was with ferofluids...
2012-08-04T15:40:26  <delt0r> Keeping them in suspension is tricky
2012-08-04T15:41:40  <mcstar> are they in suspension, when they come in contact with an external field?
2012-08-04T15:42:00  <delt0r> yes
2012-08-04T15:42:25  <mcstar> what is their composition anyway?
2012-08-04T15:42:30  <delt0r> Magnetic fields switch the viscosity ... non newtonian as well
2012-08-04T15:42:47  <delt0r> typiclly iron oxide spheres.
2012-08-04T15:43:04  <mcstar> porous?
2012-08-04T15:43:09  <delt0r> no...
2012-08-04T15:43:20  <mcstar> why dont they sediment?
2012-08-04T15:43:51  <mcstar> maybe they do
2012-08-04T15:44:04  <mcstar> wait, are the suspended in water at all?
2012-08-04T15:44:19  <delt0r> yes
2012-08-04T15:44:23  <mcstar> i have no idea about ferrofluids, i only saw some youtube videos
2012-08-04T15:44:26  <delt0r> but also hydrocarbons
2012-08-04T15:44:48  <delt0r> they do sediment
2012-08-04T15:44:51  <delt0r> that is the problem

2012-08-04T15:54:24  <mcstar> like, i inly have the spatial overage of the colloid positions, over little cells
2012-08-04T15:54:34  <mcstar> and only have a temporal overage of their positions
2012-08-04T15:55:08  <mcstar> now, i have to calculate similar structural properties, like the pair correlation function, as in the first case
2012-08-04T15:55:32  <mcstar> when i could see instantenous position, with much greater spatial accuracy
2012-08-04T15:55:39  <mcstar> how do i do that?
2012-08-04T15:56:04  <mcstar> soo many typos, just ignore them
2012-08-04T15:57:18  <mcstar> what im trying to do, is calculate the effective pair potential of these particles, from the g(r)
2012-08-04T15:58:00  <mcstar> through some closure relation, or maybe with a maximum entropy method...
2012-08-04T15:58:40  <mcstar> but i think it is going to be a problem that my data is an average of the real thing

2012-08-04T16:18:21  <delt0r> mcstar: method of moments? Perhaps... Without going over a the detailed model... its hard to know the details

2012-08-04T16:22:35  <mcstar> delt0r: theres not much to go on
2012-08-04T16:22:41  <mcstar> basically, what i said
2012-08-04T16:23:01  <mcstar> the duration of the time averaging is not really known
2012-08-04T16:23:09  <mcstar> the cellsize is known
2012-08-04T16:24:42  <delt0r> how can you know one but not the other?
2012-08-04T16:25:09  <mcstar> the data comes from a monte carlo simulation of a continuum model on a lattice
2012-08-04T16:26:12  <mcstar> i have a functional, that describes the instantenous energy of a particle distribution, sort of like a probability density function, but not normalized

2012-08-04T16:26:40  <mcstar> and i put fluctuations into the model, by using the metropolis algorithm
2012-08-04T16:27:21  <mcstar> the point is, if i simply solved the model, where i can see smooth solutions, without thermodynamic fluctuations, i couldnt study the liquid phase
2012-08-04T16:27:41  <mcstar> which is a homogenoous solution of (which minimizes) the funtional
2012-08-04T16:28:33  <mcstar> but i need to 'see' the liquid phase, to compute pair correlations of the 'particles' that form the distribution
2012-08-04T16:29:05  <mcstar> so i can use inversion, to get the pair potential, that the original model assumes between its 'particles'
2012-08-04T16:29:14  <mcstar> hm, sounds convoluted
