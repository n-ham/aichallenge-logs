2011-01-05T00:16:38  <antimatroid1> i agree with the game
2011-01-05T00:17:00  <antimatroid1> you want something that is simple to understand and easy for people to get started, but complex enough that there is variation in the strategies at the top of the leaderboard
2011-01-05T00:21:43  <sigh> which game?
2011-01-05T00:24:18  <sigh> antimatroid1 ^^
2011-01-05T00:28:17  <antimatroid1> sigh: any game
2011-01-05T00:29:01  <sigh> which game are you agreeing with?
2011-01-05T00:40:41  <antimatroid1> no game, that's the ideal kind of game for an ai contest
2011-01-05T00:46:52  <sigh> oh sure

2011-01-05T17:50:58  <Cyndre> pic it and share
2011-01-05T17:51:18  <j3camero> Oh man that would be so creepy.
2011-01-05T17:51:26  <Zannick> hahaha
2011-01-05T17:51:26  <j3camero> The shop is too small and quiet for me to get away with that.
2011-01-05T17:51:57  <Zannick> also that github repo has very old code in it
2011-01-05T17:52:09  <j3camero> Yeah. I think it needs a serious update.
2011-01-05T17:52:16  <amstan_> well.. if we could update it
2011-01-05T17:52:16  <Cyndre> I like how its because its to small of a shop and your worried about getting seen more then how creepy it is
2011-01-05T17:52:51  <j3camero> I am just psychopathic like that yep. It's not wrong unless you get caught, everyone knows that :-P
2011-01-05T17:53:00  <Zannick> besides that all of the code should be replaced anyway, it's outdated wrt to the google svn repo
2011-01-05T17:53:28  <j3camero> Yup as of now the de facto repo is still at Google Code, even though we all want to move it to GitHub.
2011-01-05T17:54:24  <Zannick> is danielvf contactable to give you admin rights over those repos? (and who has the ai-contest account, anyway?)

2011-01-05T18:15:13  <antimatroid> litre beers*
2011-01-05T18:15:27  <jmcarthur> haha
2011-01-05T18:15:31  <jmcarthur> that was forever ago
2011-01-05T18:15:41  <antimatroid> i just got up :)
2011-01-05T18:17:11  <antimatroid> amstan: what are you guys meeting about?
2011-01-05T18:17:36  <amstan_> antimatroid: everything
2011-01-05T18:18:11  <jmcarthur> so i'm thinking that i might generalize this engine for whatever game comes along in the future and give it several different modes of operation (one local game, local tournament mode, network server mode, network client mode, replay mode(?))
2011-01-05T18:18:19  <jmcarthur> for the networking stuff in particular i have some ideas i'd like to see
2011-01-05T18:18:46  <jmcarthur> support for multiple bots from a single person at a time, for example
2011-01-05T18:19:03  <jmcarthur> and support for multiple games at once
2011-01-05T18:19:46  <Zannick> jmcarthur: how real time is it? from your description in the forums it just sounded like simul-turns like planet wars was
2011-01-05T18:20:21  <jmcarthur> Zannick: the stratego game? oh for now it's just simul-turn and you can move as many of your units per turn as you want
2011-01-05T18:20:34  <jmcarthur> rather than just one per turn
2011-01-05T18:20:40  <Zannick> yeah
2011-01-05T18:20:45  <Zannick> cool
2011-01-05T18:21:07  <jmcarthur> i'd like to be more "real time" than that, but people who like slower languages might complain about it
2011-01-05T18:21:17  <jmcarthur> like if it was a more asynchronous interface to the engine
2011-01-05T18:21:51  <Zannick> i think that's as good as it gets for fairness and ease of implementation
2011-01-05T18:21:55  <jmcarthur> and it's also just generally harder to be fair to both bots since you have tighter constraints on how quickly to feed them data
2011-01-05T18:22:02  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-05T18:22:19  <jmcarthur> there are ways to simulate continuous space with discrete time, though
2011-01-05T18:22:27  <jmcarthur> which i think would be an interesting way to go
2011-01-05T18:22:52  <antimatroid> is that just pausing play for input/output?
2011-01-05T18:22:53  <jmcarthur> well, by continuous space i just mean fine-grained discrete space and the ability to arrange for more fine-grained movements
2011-01-05T18:23:00  <antimatroid> then incrementing continuous play to the next turn?
2011-01-05T18:23:04  <jmcarthur> yeah you can think of it like that
2011-01-05T18:23:47  <antimatroid> if a game is to be approximating continous play, one would really expect the strategies to be written with a continous mindset
2011-01-05T18:23:53  <jmcarthur> i kind of like the idea that you could arrange for certain events to happen
2011-01-05T18:24:17  <jmcarthur> so like... it pauses, gives you the state of the game, and then you say "at time T i want this to happen and at time U i want this to happen"

2011-01-05T18:24:29  <antimatroid> i'd love to do a differential game
2011-01-05T18:25:37  *** iFire <iFire!~kittens@unaffiliated/ifire> has joined #aichallenge
2011-01-05T18:25:46  <jmcarthur> it gets tough with continuous space though because then things like collision detection come into the picture
2011-01-05T18:26:20  <jmcarthur> and inertia and stuff is implied for some games, too
2011-01-05T18:26:30  <jmcarthur> i kind of wanted that shooter idea i had earlier to be like this though
2011-01-05T18:27:22  <Zannick> a continuous space game where orders can only be processed every x time? (eg x=1 sec.)
2011-01-05T18:27:47  <jmcarthur> right
2011-01-05T18:28:05  <Zannick> hm. seems neat, though complicated
2011-01-05T18:28:21  <jmcarthur> would be hard to get started with i think
2011-01-05T18:28:25  <jmcarthur> probably not good for this contest
2011-01-05T18:28:28  <Zannick> yeah, that's what i'm thinking
2011-01-05T18:28:34  <jmcarthur> which is a shame, because it does sound fun, IMO
2011-01-05T18:28:45  <jmcarthur> a definitely fun to watch
2011-01-05T18:29:00  <jmcarthur> *and

2011-01-05T18:36:33  <amstan_> jmcarthur: +1 for generalizing engine
2011-01-05T18:36:44  <j3camero> I like the idea of a continuous game too. It would be cool to do it in continuous time as well, like a real-time FPS or something.
2011-01-05T18:36:57  <j3camero> Then people with lower latency would be at an advantage, but meh. It would be so fun.
2011-01-05T18:38:49  <jmcarthur> it would be fun, but i think the additional challenges make it inappropriate for this contest :\
2011-01-05T18:39:36  <jmcarthur> amstan_, j3camero: if either of you have general requests for an engine i'll consider adding them
2011-01-05T18:41:34  <jmcarthur> i'm thinking about making a "lobby" for the network game stuff to give the matchup algorithm a chance to make a better match and so that people don't have to add random wait loops just to get more variety
2011-01-05T18:41:52  <jmcarthur> and in fact i'm planning for the loop to be in the client itself so nobody has to deal with it
2011-01-05T18:42:18  <jmcarthur> and if you C^c it finishes whatever game(s) are currently running so you don't forfeit :D
2011-01-05T18:42:30  <jmcarthur> i haven't started any of the network stuff yet though
2011-01-05T18:49:07  <jmcarthur> so far these are the only options i have implemented: http://hpaste.org/42780/engine_thingy_help
2011-01-05T18:49:52  <jmcarthur> well, --maxturns is game-specific, and i'm not quite done with the stderr saving stuff, but that won't take much effort
2011-01-05T18:50:57  <jmcarthur> --killafter is intended so that bots can close up file handles and stuff cleanly after the game is over. engine gives a notification, waits for a short time, then forcefully kills the bot if it's still running

2011-01-05T18:52:26  <jmcarthur> and then try a SIGKILL if that doesn't work
2011-01-05T18:53:02  <Zannick> implementing a sigint handler isn't necessarily easy in all languages
2011-01-05T18:53:28  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-01-05T18:53:31  <jmcarthur> i guess you're right

2011-01-05T23:07:49  <dmj111> jmcarthur: one other issue I have is relating the difference in mu to the probability of win / loss.  microsoft's documentation on trueskill is better than their developer docs, but still leaves a lot of room for better explanations.
