2011-08-26T05:38:03  <delt0r_> ok --So there may be some activity from me here this weekend.
2011-08-26T05:38:24  <aerique> ants is still in beta because mcleopold has been on holiday and busy and no one else (including me) has picked up after him to wrap things up
2011-08-26T05:38:49  <delt0r_> The TCP server interface is something that kinda needs to plug into the website toolchain or whatever
2011-08-26T05:39:14  <delt0r_> mcleopold used a lot of Python ? IIRC
2011-08-26T05:39:24  <aerique> yup
2011-08-26T05:39:50  <aerique> i can understand them wanting it to keep to one language
2011-08-26T05:39:58  <delt0r_> indeed
2011-08-26T05:40:21  <aerique> some other people have been working on a tcp server as well iirc, might want to check github for forks
2011-08-26T05:40:26  <delt0r_> I am not too hot at python... but it is not a hard language...
2011-08-26T05:40:33  <delt0r_> sure
2011-08-26T05:40:43  <delt0r_> won't start till tomorrow anyway
2011-08-26T05:41:36  <aerique> i mainly want to work on / wrap up some personal projects before i lose two months on the challenge :)
2011-08-26T05:41:42  <delt0r_> did the python version of TrueSkill get fixed, or is the beta server still using the java version?
2011-08-26T05:42:09  <delt0r_> aerique: well starting this time of year would be silly anyway
2011-08-26T05:42:33  <delt0r_> we are all on holiday or traveling...
2011-08-26T05:42:45  <delt0r_> more or less--at least at university
2011-08-26T05:43:20  <aerique> delt0r_: can't help with trueskill
2011-08-26T05:44:26  <delt0r_> np

2011-08-26T06:34:59  <eashoka> mathis: yeah you got a nice bot out there... I like the feature where it drives away other ants and clean up an area. cool!
2011-08-26T06:36:15  <mathis> yeah i like that as well :)
2011-08-26T06:36:48  <eashoka> anybody knows why the ranking page continue to stay as broken... 5th continuous day now! :-(
2011-08-26T06:37:52  <mathis> but in a lot of cases other enemy ants go in that clear area... you'd have to chase the enemies away circular in all directions ...
2011-08-26T06:38:20  <eashoka> mathis: yeah I noticed, it doesn't work well with some bots
2011-08-26T06:38:58  <mcstar> what is your won/lost battle ratio? mathis
2011-08-26T06:39:11  <eashoka> mathis: for instance, you have a minus record against kadiyaa if I'm not mistaken.
2011-08-26T06:39:27  <eashoka> my won/lost ratio against you ?
2011-08-26T06:39:46  <mcstar> ?
2011-08-26T06:39:48  <eashoka> oh my recent bot has played you only 3 times yet and you have won all! :-)
2011-08-26T06:39:55  <mathis> do you see it somewhere on the page?
2011-08-26T06:40:07  <mcstar> no, im just curious if you know it
2011-08-26T06:40:27  <mathis> oh no i haven't kept track of that
2011-08-26T06:40:34  <mcstar> im interested in how well the current best bot handles battles
2011-08-26T06:41:12  <mcstar> eashoka: to whom did you direct your question?
2011-08-26T06:41:37  <eashoka> mcstar: sorry, I got mixed up your names mcstar and mathis
2011-08-26T06:41:41  <mcstar> ok
2011-08-26T06:42:27  <mleise> In my Pidgin your colors are even all a shade of pink. It's really easy to mix you all up, mathis, mcstar and eashoka.
2011-08-26T06:43:00  <mleise> Which was that bot that lost due to a timeout 15 turns before the game was over?
2011-08-26T06:43:07  <eashoka> mcstar : BTW, what is your bot name ?
2011-08-26T06:43:13  <mcstar> mleise: dark blue, eashoka green, mathis cyan
2011-08-26T06:43:35  <mcstar> eashoka: imagine
2011-08-26T06:43:44  <mcstar> i havent updated it in quite some time
2011-08-26T06:44:02  <mcstar> i dont think i will until the contest starts
2011-08-26T06:44:11  <eashoka> mcstar : ok. waiting for the tcp server ? :-)
2011-08-26T06:44:17  <mcstar> no
2011-08-26T06:44:20  <mcstar> busy
2011-08-26T06:44:21  <mathis> among my last 50 games there were 5 with kadiyaa, he won 3, i won 2
2011-08-26T06:44:54  <eashoka> mleise : could have been me. I had a notorious timeout problem. lost so many won games. specially against UVAnts
2011-08-26T06:44:55  <mcstar> mathis: arent you Plapp?
2011-08-26T06:45:15  <mcstar> (i know someone by that name)
2011-08-26T06:45:34  <mathis> no, my real name is Mathis
2011-08-26T06:45:50  <mcstar> yeah, i know a Mathis Plapp
2011-08-26T06:46:04  <mathis> ah okay no that's not me
2011-08-26T06:46:48  <mleise> that was the game: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=109102
2011-08-26T06:48:23  <mleise> It isn't mentioned anywhere but you can now press [Space], [PgUp], [PgDown] etc. without the browser catching those as well
2011-08-26T06:48:34  <eashoka> mathis: in kadiyaa's 10 games with you so far, he has won 6 and you 4 (or may be it's 5-5, I'm not sure) but that's remarkable considering the skill gap between bots. similarly I used to have a good time with Revolt, even though he is higher in skill
2011-08-26T06:49:20  <mcstar> mleise: that happens with too careful bots :)
2011-08-26T06:49:55  <mleise> well they were both careful about their defense
2011-08-26T06:49:56  <mcstar> seems darkmomo doesnt handle corner cases well
2011-08-26T06:50:06  <mleise> but not about their general activity
2011-08-26T06:50:12  <mcstar> hes got some mixup in ant selection, thats why to blocked messages
2011-08-26T06:50:27  <mcstar> to->the
2011-08-26T06:50:37  <mcstar> evetually hes got too many ants to control
2011-08-26T06:51:01  <mcstar> should have just attacked revolt
2011-08-26T06:51:41  <mleise> more ants is not always better it seems ;)
2011-08-26T06:52:17  <mcstar> lol, its in c++ though
2011-08-26T06:52:29  <eashoka> mcstar, mleise : Revolt has got a simple solution for what you just explain. after some any size, he attacks all and exchange off ants. but there could be few games where the trick has backfired on him
2011-08-26T06:52:41  <mleise> No language can reduce algorithmic complexity
2011-08-26T06:53:03  <mcstar> mleise: i meant that its an inherently fast language
2011-08-26T06:53:16  <mcstar> i wouldnt be suprised if it happend with pyhton
2011-08-26T06:53:32  <mcstar> but it seems he is already streching c++'s limit
2011-08-26T06:53:42  <eashoka> what I have seen so far is unless you are not doing some terrible wrong thing with the code, it is actually bit hard to get timed out :-)
2011-08-26T06:54:05  <eashoka> mcstar : not sure about c++, I know C is fast for sure
2011-08-26T06:54:36  <mcstar> hm, i dont think it'd be slower
2011-08-26T06:54:39  <mleise> I wrote me a visual debugger that creates a graph of all the code modules and the time they took.
2011-08-26T06:54:42  <eashoka> eashoka : and java is not. but as mleise pointed out, it's the algorithm mainly
2011-08-26T06:55:30  <mcstar> its not just the algorithm, a good language/implementation can give you a magnitude speedup
2011-08-26T06:56:09  <mcstar> but yeah, surely, you can f up big time chosing a high time complexity alg.
2011-08-26T06:56:14  <mleise> O(n²) algorithms will always timeout at a sensitive number of ants
2011-08-26T06:56:41  <mcstar> O(n) not?
2011-08-26T06:56:58  <mleise> that was a bit exaggerated, but hey :p
2011-08-26T06:57:03  <mcstar> i see you are very comfortable with unicode
2011-08-26T06:57:08  <eashoka> mleise : here's another one. fun at my expense. http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=152555&user=264
2011-08-26T06:57:18  <mleise> With O(n) you have to do a lot of computations to run out of time.
2011-08-26T06:57:26  <mcstar> omg
2011-08-26T06:57:31  <mcstar> yeah, so what?
2011-08-26T06:57:49  <mcstar> O notation doesnt give you exact time
2011-08-26T06:58:03  <mcstar> a O(n^2) can be faster than an O(n)
2011-08-26T06:58:25  <mleise> no, but we have always had games with ~1000 ants. And an n² algorithm makes that 1000000 operations.
2011-08-26T06:59:17  <mleise> It is bound to time out in this game in any language with lots of ants.
2011-08-26T06:59:24  <mcstar> obviously you first have to differentiate among the ants with an O(n) selector
2011-08-26T06:59:37  <mcstar> mleise: you are talking about generalities
2011-08-26T06:59:46  <mcstar> its like tomorrow will be a day
2011-08-26T07:01:03  <mcstar> my point is, you really need to test an alg. to see where is the turning point
2011-08-26T07:01:13  <mleise> narf, I'm gonna look at eashoka's link
2011-08-26T07:01:17  <mcstar> and of course profiling profiling profiling
2011-08-26T07:01:36  <mcstar> who is narf?
2011-08-26T07:03:23  <mcstar> for example to give you an example from my experience
2011-08-26T07:03:27  <mcstar> mleise: still there?
2011-08-26T07:03:38  <mleise> uh yes, just came back from the visualizer
2011-08-26T07:03:58  <mcstar> well, for a* i need a priority queue implementation
2011-08-26T07:04:00  <mleise> UvAntsBeta is just standing still, fascinating. But it still collects foof
2011-08-26T07:04:02  <mleise> *food
2011-08-26T07:04:26  <mleise> mcstar: most good libraries offer one
2011-08-26T07:04:27  <mathis> eashoka: i like the fact that there are bots with higher skill losing repeatedly against bots with lower skill.
2011-08-26T07:04:31  <mcstar> they implement priority queues with binary of fibonacci trees

2011-08-26T07:05:33  <mcstar> so the lesson, is that the data set is minimal for them to be effective
2011-08-26T07:06:18  <eashoka> mliese : yeah, I think he knows its beyond his calculation ability with that many ants so he just passes. (or he has a good time checker inside) which is smart.
2011-08-26T07:07:21  <mleise> eashoka: simply extrapolate the estimated time requirements from the last turns.
2011-08-26T07:08:11  <mcstar> i think that game kind of show a phase transition
2011-08-26T07:08:21  <eashoka> mleise : good idea. thanks.
2011-08-26T07:08:41  <mcstar> actually more like a spinodal decomposition

2011-08-26T07:10:25  *** sigh is now known as Guest61329
2011-08-26T07:11:14  <mleise> but I have no f... idea what aspinodal decomposition is
2011-08-26T07:11:41  <mcstar> yeah, but i dont exclude the possibility that from each bors microscopic law of motion/interaction the ending can be predicted with high accuracy
2011-08-26T07:11:52  <mcstar> bors->bots
2011-08-26T07:12:36  <mcstar> the problem with this, is that probably solving the theoretical model wouldnt be chaper(computationally) than playing the games
2011-08-26T07:12:44  <mcstar> cheaer
2011-08-26T07:12:46  <mcstar> f
2011-08-26T07:12:51  <mcstar> excuse my typos
2011-08-26T07:13:38  <mcstar> a spinodal decomposition is material separation in composit melts
2011-08-26T07:14:30  *** Obeleh <Obeleh!541e6ad4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.84.30.106.212> has joined #aichallenge
2011-08-26T07:14:57  <Obeleh> Can someone explain something to me?
2011-08-26T07:15:06  <eashoka> mathis : yeah me too. hope my next bot will give your one some competition. problem is the server is so slow now. I get only about 3 games per day
2011-08-26T07:15:10  <Obeleh> I understand that ghostrankings are a nice thing to have
2011-08-26T07:15:11  <mcstar> how do you know me? Obeleh
2011-08-26T07:15:24  <Obeleh> But what if my current skill > ghostranking.skill ?
2011-08-26T07:15:44  <Obeleh> I'm still havig ghostranking after 13 games :(
2011-08-26T07:16:02  <Obeleh> Do I know you?? Huh?
2011-08-26T07:16:18  <Obeleh> I think I dont :P
2011-08-26T07:16:19  <mcstar> Obeleh: just a joke, i use the nick "someone" in a popular fps
2011-08-26T07:16:44  <mcstar> eashoka: why are you disappointed?
2011-08-26T07:16:45  <Obeleh> Oh ok LOL :P
2011-08-26T07:16:54  <mcstar> the contest hasnt even begun
2011-08-26T07:17:07  <mathis> Obeleh: the current rankings haven't been updated  for about 3 days now i think
2011-08-26T07:17:16  <mcstar> i mean, you shouldnt really be developing your bot full-time
2011-08-26T07:17:20  <eashoka> mcstar : difficult to test bots without getting few games per day
2011-08-26T07:17:22  <Obeleh> aaaah. Why?
2011-08-26T07:17:28  <mcstar> yeah, sure
2011-08-26T07:17:35  <mcstar> but why is it a problem?
2011-08-26T07:17:47  <mcstar> i see people react like you do
2011-08-26T07:17:56  <mcstar> and i dont understand what do they expect?
2011-08-26T07:17:59  <mathis> Obeleh: i have no idea
2011-08-26T07:18:13  <mcstar> just wait till it begins, the work on it hard
2011-08-26T07:18:20  <mcstar> youll be given 2 months
2011-08-26T07:18:33  <mcstar> what will you do than, if you solve all your problems now?
2011-08-26T07:18:34  <Obeleh> mcstar  I'dd be willing to offer a server for the beta
2011-08-26T07:18:48  <mcstar> whoa, that is god news though
2011-08-26T07:18:53  <mcstar> +o
2011-08-26T07:18:57  <mcstar> talk to mleise
2011-08-26T07:19:03  <mcstar> he will direct you further
2011-08-26T07:19:12  <Obeleh> My desktop PC isn't doing anything at home
2011-08-26T07:19:18  <Obeleh> I use my Laptops all the time
2011-08-26T07:19:22  <Obeleh> And I have a good connection
2011-08-26T07:19:27  <eashoka> obeleh : ideally ghost ranking should never be higher than your current ranking.
2011-08-26T07:19:37  <mathis> eashoka: i hope there will be good competition soon, i don't feel motivated to work on my bot as long as i'm on the first place :D
2011-08-26T07:19:43  <mcstar> one problem: you could see the source
2011-08-26T07:19:51  <mcstar> youd be excluded from the participants
2011-08-26T07:20:45  <mcstar> Obeleh: the usual method is to rent a server in the cloud for the use of the organizers
2011-08-26T07:20:46  <Obeleh> down 120 Mbit/s up 10 Mbit/s
2011-08-26T07:21:27  <Obeleh> Wouldnt it be possible that I run a VM where I dont have any access to? Like no root and no user account?
2011-08-26T07:21:42  <mcstar> :S
2011-08-26T07:21:45  <mcstar> not sure
2011-08-26T07:21:59  <mcstar> i mean you definitely have to talk to them mcleopold and such
2011-08-26T07:22:07  <eashoka> mathis : will we can try to help you get your motivation back. :-)
2011-08-26T07:22:31  <mleise> Obeleh: You could provide a server for the beta potentially. During the beta it is ok to have server access like I do.
2011-08-26T07:22:41  <Obeleh> And as long as it is beta
2011-08-26T07:22:47  <Obeleh> Yea thats what I meant
2011-08-26T07:22:50  <mcstar> erm
2011-08-26T07:22:54  <mleise> erm?
2011-08-26T07:22:56  <mcstar> i not comfortable with that
2011-08-26T07:23:08  <mleise> har har, I can haz your code anytime
2011-08-26T07:23:09  <mcstar> i mean people already load up pretty good codes
2011-08-26T07:23:15  <Obeleh> Even with a VM where I dont hva access?
2011-08-26T07:23:27  <mcstar> mleise: can haz my cheezburger but nah mz codez
2011-08-26T07:23:48  <Obeleh> And what if it only runs executables?
2011-08-26T07:23:56  <Obeleh> Just as a match server
2011-08-26T07:24:12  <Obeleh> Some other server could compile it and send it up
2011-08-26T07:24:14  <mcstar> you could provide a host for a tcp server
2011-08-26T07:24:21  <mcstar> that'd be totally okk
2011-08-26T07:24:40  <mleise> If it makes you feel more comfortable, I'm not cheating. I haven't looked at a single submission unless it was to help someone fix a compilation error and they asked someone to take a look
2011-08-26T07:25:00  <mcstar> mleise: i didnt imply you are
2011-08-26T07:25:12  <mcstar> but i trust you
2011-08-26T07:25:19  <mcstar> sort of(not with my life)
2011-08-26T07:25:23  <mleise> but why are you not confortable then? :)
2011-08-26T07:25:56  <mcstar> well, someone shows up, im not immediately comfortable with him getting access to all the uploaded sources
2011-08-26T07:26:29  <Obeleh> I understand mcstar's reservations
2011-08-26T07:26:57  <Obeleh> But Im sure we could work out something where I can donate CPU / Bandwith without me being able to Haz his codes?
2011-08-26T07:27:41  <mcstar> yeah like i said the tcp server
2011-08-26T07:27:49  <mcstar> but it needs to be done first
2011-08-26T07:27:49  <eashoka> Obeleh : thanks man! g8 to hear
2011-08-26T07:28:25  <Obeleh> meanwhile I could run executable for the beta ?
2011-08-26T07:28:28  <mcstar> Obeleh: what we refer here by tcp server, is like your machine running games with bots connecting remotely over http
2011-08-26T07:28:33  <mleise> The cloud servers probably use the compiled binaries, but for languages like JavaScript that doesn't make a difference
2011-08-26T07:28:36  <Obeleh> I know
2011-08-26T07:28:42  <Obeleh> I participated last season
2011-08-26T07:28:46  <mcstar> ok
2011-08-26T07:28:55  <Obeleh> Was in top 100 untill I had to stop for school
2011-08-26T07:28:56  <mcstar> i didnt :)
2011-08-26T07:29:18  <mleise> mcstar: you didn't participate in PlanetWars?
2011-08-26T07:29:23  <mcstar> no
2011-08-26T07:29:32  <Obeleh> Doesnt a TCP server need like tons of free ports?
2011-08-26T07:29:35  <mleise> You sound like a aichallenge pro
2011-08-26T07:29:39  <Obeleh> Because Im behind a router
2011-08-26T07:29:49  <mcstar> sry, its a deception
2011-08-26T07:29:51  <mcstar> :D
2011-08-26T07:30:19  <mcstar> Obeleh: consider that an http server handles thousands of connections over port 80
2011-08-26T07:30:21  <mleise> lol. - free ports, yes. hmm. UPNP?
2011-08-26T07:30:33  <Obeleh> kk
2011-08-26T07:31:08  <mcstar> the routed packets know where to go, when the os gets them
2011-08-26T07:31:22  <mcstar> im not sure about the details
2011-08-26T07:31:27  <mleise> oh yes, you only need one open port for the bots to connect and the server will then switch over from this listening socket to a new socket. the router can handle this.
2011-08-26T07:31:46  <Obeleh> ok
2011-08-26T07:32:48  <Obeleh> If I reinstall my destop and give you ssh/ vnc access that would be fine?
2011-08-26T07:32:55  <mcstar> Obeleh: you interested in developing the server?
2011-08-26T07:33:08  <mleise> as in: there is no server yet :p
2011-08-26T07:33:24  <Obeleh> Cant we copy the old one?
2011-08-26T07:33:35  <Obeleh> I suppose 75% would be the same
2011-08-26T07:33:37  <mcstar> thats kind of half-assed solution
2011-08-26T07:33:52  <mcstar> berak tried, didnt succeed fully
2011-08-26T07:34:15  <mcstar> now delt0r_ is going for the same glory
2011-08-26T07:34:27  <mcstar> talk to them
2011-08-26T07:34:34  <Obeleh> delt0r played last season right?
2011-08-26T07:34:50  <Obeleh> I think I remember his name
2011-08-26T07:35:14  <mleise> yeah he has that strange comic icon on the forums
2011-08-26T07:35:37  <mcstar> delt0rid
2011-08-26T07:35:49  <mcstar> i think its a typo
2011-08-26T07:35:52  <Obeleh> btw sry about my github pull request ;)
2011-08-26T07:35:58  <Obeleh> I was blind ;)

2011-08-26T07:37:24  <mcstar> hm, your net is 80 times faster than mine
2011-08-26T07:37:29  <mcstar> im kind of envious
2011-08-26T07:37:31  <mleise> I don't maintain the website, just the visualizer, Obeleh :)
2011-08-26T07:37:38  <Obeleh> ah ok
2011-08-26T07:37:57  <eashoka> mleise : any updates on the state of scheduling/pairing defects ?
2011-08-26T07:38:22  <Obeleh> mcstar  My city is going to get fiber somewhere this year :D
2011-08-26T07:38:30  <mleise> no. i don't even know who would work on that except for McLeopold
2011-08-26T07:38:46  <mleise> that poor guy will be flooded with work when he's back
2011-08-26T07:39:18  <mleise> Obeleh: interesting, add my citiy to the list
2011-08-26T07:39:27  <Obeleh> hahaha
