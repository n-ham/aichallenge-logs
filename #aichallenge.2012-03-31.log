2012-03-31T02:39:31  <smiley1983> updated asteroids engine: divides turns into many smaller steps. Doesn't yet have a speed cap (will need a separate cap for bullets and players, otherwise players will die when shooting and flying forwards) https://github.com/smiley1983/aichallenge/tree/asteroids
2012-03-31T02:53:43  <smiley1983> Does anyone have any thoughts on passing the player x_speed and y_speed values for bullets and asteroids?
2012-03-31T02:54:58  <smiley1983> Currently the player gets x_speed and y_speed for ships, but heading + speed for bullets and asteroids
2012-03-31T02:58:15  <smiley1983> II'm thinking of adding x and y speeds, and possibly taking away the heading and combined speed (keeping heading for ships)
