2011-02-06T00:00:08  <jmcarthur> typically if it takes any more than 1.5 times the amount of time an equivalent C program would take i treat it as a bug
2011-02-06T00:00:23  <j3camero> Impressive.
2011-02-06T00:00:35  * antimatroid still doesn't understand haskell very well :(
2011-02-06T00:00:41  <antimatroid> i am in limbo with no language i like
2011-02-06T00:00:56  <j3camero> Although I kid. Performance on CPU-bound tasks is so unimportant these days. I haven't written a CPU-bound program in like forever.
2011-02-06T00:01:00  <jmcarthur> and naive haskell often beats naive C. however, superoptimized C will always win
2011-02-06T00:01:03  <jbroman> antimatroid: I think most people are like that with Haskell. Until they have the "Woah, I can see the monads" moment.
2011-02-06T00:01:22  <jmcarthur> monads are vastly overrated
2011-02-06T00:01:36  <jmcarthur> they are useful, but have little to do with "getting" haskell
2011-02-06T00:01:58  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Hmm…well you don't really understand how some important things, like IO, work without them.
2011-02-06T00:02:06  <jmcarthur> sure you do
2011-02-06T00:02:09  <jbroman> I admittedly am using "monad" as my Haskell buzzword.
2011-02-06T00:02:16  <jmcarthur> IO with do notation is just imperative programming
2011-02-06T00:02:28  <antimatroid> i really like how types are handled from what i've seen of haskell
2011-02-06T00:02:40  <jmcarthur> and maybe you could get away with understanding the difference between execution and evaluation, but that's not really the same as understanding monads
2011-02-06T00:02:45  <McLeopold> it's working, except for the distance checks, just need to order them
2011-02-06T00:02:52  <antimatroid> i would be happy with c++ if there were a few adjustments
2011-02-06T00:03:02  <jbroman> jmcarthur: You can treat it like imperative programming, but I don't think it's precisely the same thing. But I'm a Haskell newbie, so I could be totally off.
2011-02-06T00:03:25  <jmcarthur> jbroman: it's precisely the same thing. the IO monad is the embodiment of imperative programming, embedded as a DSL within haskell
2011-02-06T00:03:58  <jmcarthur> jbroman: once you learn the "monad way" you can do thing *beyond* mere imperative programming by using haskell as a meta language, but the imperativeness of IO itself is still there
2011-02-06T00:04:03  <jmcarthur> *do things
2011-02-06T00:04:13  <McLeopold> j3camero: can we discuss creating new ants
2011-02-06T00:04:28  <antimatroid> i'll discuss it :P
2011-02-06T00:04:39  <McLeopold> I wrote a piece that would only create a new ant if 1 and only 1 force was within range.
2011-02-06T00:04:59  <McLeopold> I'm thinking that range can be different than the combat range
2011-02-06T00:05:07  <McLeopold> like at distance 1
2011-02-06T00:05:28  <jmcarthur> jbroman: it is for this reason that i see IO as a kind of "giving up" on functional programming. we can't figure out a way to do this stuff declaratively yet, so we just use imperative programming instead
2011-02-06T00:06:25  <antimatroid> what about you get a spawned ant if you walk off a square containing food?
2011-02-06T00:06:34  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: sometimes I want my computer to do different things when I use it...
2011-02-06T00:06:35  <jbroman> jmcarthur: That's exactly why Haskell quarantines like that. You sometimes need it for a few things (like IO), but you're supposed to write most of your code in a purely functional way and only use the IO monad for IO.
2011-02-06T00:06:54  <jmcarthur> jbroman: yes, the quarantine is a good thing
2011-02-06T00:07:00  <jmcarthur> jbroman: but that doesn't make it less of a "sin bin"
2011-02-06T00:07:14  <McLeopold> antimatroid: food is blocking, since it can become an ant, so I'd prefer you just need to be next to it
2011-02-06T00:07:23  <jmcarthur> IO is where you go when you admit to yourself that you haven't thought of a good way to do it declaratively
2011-02-06T00:07:34  <McLeopold> it's also blocking so I don't have to have 2 layers of a matrix to contain the info. :)
2011-02-06T00:08:02  <jmcarthur> jbroman: the "monad" characterization of IO actually came *after* IO and is not special at all
2011-02-06T00:08:26  <antimatroid> you can't have two ants 1 away from a piece of food can you?
2011-02-06T00:08:31  <antimatroid> from opposing teams?
2011-02-06T00:08:37  <j3camero> What if two different colors are within range of food then the food just goes away?
2011-02-06T00:08:50  <antimatroid> if you handle food after fights
2011-02-06T00:09:02  <McLeopold> I was thinking it would just stick around until 1 force drove off the other
2011-02-06T00:09:08  <McLeopold> but...
2011-02-06T00:09:14  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: well, for example, functional reactive programming as a kind of declarative, interactive, continuous, concurrent interface, which characterizes a lot of systems that we currently just stick in IO
2011-02-06T00:09:17  <McLeopold> j3camero: that has a good side affect
2011-02-06T00:09:44  <McLeopold> remember how we were talking about passageways should have less food?
2011-02-06T00:10:01  <j3camero> Ah yes. The no mans land will have no food.
2011-02-06T00:10:03  <McLeopold> this is a natural way to make food more reliable in a protected area
2011-02-06T00:10:19  <McLeopold> food disappears if within distance of 2 ants
2011-02-06T00:10:26  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: that is, it allows you to interact with the real world (in certain ways) while still being declarative. it's just an example of one direction we could go instead of IO for some things
2011-02-06T00:11:08  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: that computer comment was a total joke.  I don't have enough brain power for a haskell discussion
2011-02-06T00:11:13  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-02-06T00:11:17  <antimatroid> hang on, if you made food change when you are ajdacent (not diagonally) to it and you process that after conflicts, wouldn't that always work?
2011-02-06T00:11:18  <McLeopold> :)
2011-02-06T00:12:10  <antimatroid> wait, no, nevermind me
2011-02-06T00:12:29  * jmcarthur works on his purely functional real-time graphics library
2011-02-06T00:12:29  <j3camero> I don't like it. Having food mid battle would seem to be kind of messy. My vote it to make food go away if two enemies arrive at the same moment.
2011-02-06T00:12:50  <antimatroid> having food mid battle what?
2011-02-06T00:12:58  <McLeopold> yeah, I kinda agree
2011-02-06T00:13:20  <McLeopold> although food could appear just behind a defense, helping it out
2011-02-06T00:14:36  <j3camero> So do we have any ants-specific code yet? I'm looking and I see planet_wars but not zombies or ants
2011-02-06T00:14:48  <McLeopold> you have to switch branches
2011-02-06T00:14:55  <jmcarthur> simpleants branch
2011-02-06T00:15:07  <jbroman> j3camero: git checkout -b origin/simpleants
2011-02-06T00:15:19  <j3camero> Okay.
2011-02-06T00:15:26  <jmcarthur> i think that's not right
2011-02-06T00:15:41  <McLeopold> git checkout -b simpleants remotes/origin/simpleants
2011-02-06T00:15:46  <jmcarthur> -b is for making new branches
2011-02-06T00:15:49  <jmcarthur> there we go
2011-02-06T00:16:00  <McLeopold> well, it's also for linnking to an existing branch
2011-02-06T00:16:15  <jbroman> Err...yeah. I didn't think you needed the "remotes/", but that's what I meant.
2011-02-06T00:16:18  <jmcarthur> well... with a new branch
2011-02-06T00:16:25  <McLeopold> also, you may want to try and pull my changes from my fork
2011-02-06T00:16:26  <j3camero> So does that branch ever get merged into the main branch?
2011-02-06T00:16:35  <jmcarthur> it's a new branch pointing to the same head as another branch
2011-02-06T00:16:52  <jmcarthur> IMO, simpleants should be a different repo, not a branch
2011-02-06T00:17:04  <j3camero> Oh god. Mind is getting blown by this DVCS business. WHICH REPO IS THE REAL ONE???
2011-02-06T00:17:08  <jmcarthur> because it's a different logical project
2011-02-06T00:17:16  <McLeopold> neither
2011-02-06T00:17:26  <jbroman> I would've done them as separate repos too, but I only recently started paying attention.
2011-02-06T00:17:52  <j3camero> Okay given as we're at the start now, let's organize this the right way. How should we be doing this?
2011-02-06T00:18:12  <jmcarthur> of course nobody was interested in darcs :P j/k
2011-02-06T00:18:15  <jbroman> j3camero: We should really have separate projects for separate codebases and use branches for branching changes.
2011-02-06T00:18:19  <McLeopold> antwars as a directory in the main branch?
2011-02-06T00:18:28  <jbroman> ^ or that
2011-02-06T00:18:30  <j3camero> I want to also set up some continuous integration awesomeness, so if that has any bearing then yeah.
2011-02-06T00:18:32  <jmcarthur> that would be okay
2011-02-06T00:18:40  <jmcarthur> antwars in the main branch
2011-02-06T00:19:11  <j3camero> yeah my intuition is just to create a zombies directory beside the planet_wars directory.
2011-02-06T00:19:11  <jbroman> Although the master branch is currently hosting work on the rewrite (Zeta) engine, so maybe that ought to be a separate repo?
2011-02-06T00:19:15  <jbroman> I dunno.
2011-02-06T00:19:23  <jmcarthur> the rewrite should be completely separate
2011-02-06T00:19:29  <j3camero> That would also be my intuition jbroman.
2011-02-06T00:19:32  <jmcarthur> clean break from all old stuff
2011-02-06T00:19:47  <jbroman> In an ideal world we would also have an "aichallenge" github account to group these repos together.
2011-02-06T00:20:01  <jbroman> (As opposed to it strictly being under amstan's.)
2011-02-06T00:20:02  <j3camero> I think we do somewhere don't we?
2011-02-06T00:20:25  <jbroman> \exists github.com/aichallenge, no clue who owns it
2011-02-06T00:20:26  <amstan> jbroman: yes, i was intending to do that, just been lazy
2011-02-06T00:20:30  <jmcarthur> actually
2011-02-06T00:21:08  <jmcarthur> we could just make the official repo on the ai-contest server or something, with write access only by privileged users
2011-02-06T00:21:19  <jmcarthur> and then github could be the main "working" repo
2011-02-06T00:21:21  <amstan> jmcarthur: but then we loose github
2011-02-06T00:21:25  <jmcarthur> nono
2011-02-06T00:21:28  <jmcarthur> keep using github
2011-02-06T00:21:40  <amstan> you mean a mirror?
2011-02-06T00:21:44  <jbroman> jmcarthur: What does that get us?
2011-02-06T00:21:44  <amstan> what's the point?
2011-02-06T00:21:44  <jmcarthur> amstan or j3camero can keep a github mirror
2011-02-06T00:22:01  <jmcarthur> it gets us independence from github's occasional flakiness, for one
2011-02-06T00:22:07  <amstan> jbroman: i own it, we can switch i guess
2011-02-06T00:22:13  <jbroman> jmcarthur: DVCS means that we get that anyways.
2011-02-06T00:22:13  <j3camero> I'm just in svn withdrawal.
2011-02-06T00:22:22  <jmcarthur> and a repo with only priv. write access
2011-02-06T00:22:28  <jbroman> We can theoretically pull from each other if we want to.
2011-02-06T00:22:39  <amstan> jmcarthur: if github goes down, we can push at any point from our local repos
2011-02-06T00:22:44  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-02-06T00:22:44  <jbroman> jmcarthur: And the aichallenge GitHub repo could be only privileged write access in theory.
2011-02-06T00:22:52  <antimatroid> McLeopold: have you got a sample game for us yet? :P
2011-02-06T00:23:11  <jmcarthur> i was just thinking it would be nice to have a goto repo in such a case, but that's just me
2011-02-06T00:23:37  <jmcarthur> so we don't have to wait for somebody else to stick one up
2011-02-06T00:24:32  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i've never felt svn withdrawal. i was happy the moment i left it :P
2011-02-06T00:24:32  <McLeopold> antimatroid: almost, just working on the distance changes
2011-02-06T00:25:07  <McLeopold> j3camero: hginit.com <- it's not git, but it will get you to distributed
2011-02-06T00:25:41  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i thought you had used darcs before or something, which should have gotten you through the basics of DVCS at least
2011-02-06T00:25:42  <amstan> i guess a cron git pull could be setup on the main site
2011-02-06T00:25:45  <amstan> just for mirroring purposes
2011-02-06T00:26:20  <j3camero> There is an ai-contest user on github.
2011-02-06T00:26:30  <j3camero> I sort of think I created it, but I am unable to login to it.
2011-02-06T00:26:37  <jmcarthur> haha
2011-02-06T00:26:38  <amstan> j3camero: yeah, let's use aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:26:39  <j3camero> Maybe danielvf did it.
2011-02-06T00:26:47  <amstan> j3camero: you have owners over that now
2011-02-06T00:29:54  <j3camero> Awesome thanks.
2011-02-06T00:30:22  <j3camero> So can we grab the stuff that's currently under your account amstan, and move it over to aichallenge?
2011-02-06T00:30:37  <amstan> j3camero: just hold on for a second, i want this neatly done
2011-02-06T00:31:14  <amstan> sent this to github support: http://pastebin.com/nnmfVxtP
2011-02-06T00:32:14  <j3camero> I think all the people who have working copies based off the amstan version are pretty experimental.
2011-02-06T00:32:26  <j3camero> I don't think we would be breaking anybody's shit by just moving it over.
2011-02-06T00:32:38  <j3camero> Or am I missing something.
2011-02-06T00:32:42  <antimatroid> i'm not touching an engine till there is something more concrete, mcleopold has done the most
2011-02-06T00:32:50  <antimatroid> but i think he was intending for it to be thrown awa
2011-02-06T00:32:59  <jmcarthur> j3camero: it's distributed. nobody cares which one is the "main" one ;)
2011-02-06T00:33:02  <j3camero> Yeah that's what he said earlier I think.
2011-02-06T00:33:04  <jbroman> Ideally, I think Zeta should be in a separate repo, and the other stuff should all be in one branch (master) in separate directories.
2011-02-06T00:33:24  <j3camero> Agreed jbroman.
2011-02-06T00:33:41  <amstan> jmcarthur: i'm just worried about the forks, where it says McLeopold / aichallengeforked from amstan/aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:33:56  <amstan> jmcarthur: the forked from repo cannot be changed
2011-02-06T00:33:57  <j3camero> Does it matter?
2011-02-06T00:34:08  <amstan> jmcarthur: so by doing it through github staff they might be able to
2011-02-06T00:34:27  <jmcarthur> that's just aesthetic though, isn't it?
2011-02-06T00:34:32  <j3camero> Would he be able to push into the new repo under aichallenge anyways?
2011-02-06T00:34:33  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah, sure, lol
2011-02-06T00:34:39  * jmcarthur shrugs
2011-02-06T00:34:45  <jmcarthur> we don't really care then :P
2011-02-06T00:34:49  * antimatroid keeps making a sample bot
2011-02-06T00:34:51  <amstan> jmcarthur: there's also 15 watchers on the repo i have
2011-02-06T00:34:51  <jbroman> Well, there's git's magic "pull request" stuff etc., but…I would probably just destroy and recreate my Github fork if needed.
2011-02-06T00:35:08  <jmcarthur> amstan: delete it and fork from the new one :P
2011-02-06T00:35:19  <amstan> ok.. fine
2011-02-06T00:35:32  <antimatroid> are we doing ant hills?
2011-02-06T00:35:34  <amstan> actually.. i'll be forking the one from my repo into aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:35:37  <amstan> then deleting mine
2011-02-06T00:35:39  <antimatroid> and how are we doing scoring?
2011-02-06T00:35:50  <amstan> j3camero: also, notice how i ported the wiki over
2011-02-06T00:36:05  <j3camero> yes i saw that
2011-02-06T00:36:33  <McLeopold> woot, it's working
2011-02-06T00:36:41  <McLeopold> with the food disappearing rule
2011-02-06T00:36:47  <jbroman> If the GitHub staff are happy to move stuff for us, though, it isn't really a problem. I don't think we're in a "OMG must be done in next hour" mode.
2011-02-06T00:37:02  <j3camero> antimatroid: good question. There are a few proposals. One involves introducing anthills that spew points. Another is to score according to how much food you ate. Another is to score according to how many ants you killed.
2011-02-06T00:37:20  <amstan> Hardcore Forking Action
2011-02-06T00:37:34  <McLeopold> I think whatever discourages cherry picking is good.
2011-02-06T00:37:35  <j3camero> Yeah amstan let's just move stuff over. I don't think anybody's grown any roots in your account's copy.
2011-02-06T00:37:53  <amstan> @forget repo
2011-02-06T00:37:53  <contestbot> amstan: Job's done.
2011-02-06T00:37:53  <McLeopold> just me ;)
2011-02-06T00:38:02  <amstan> @learn repo as https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:38:02  <contestbot> amstan: As you wish.
2011-02-06T00:38:05  <amstan> @repo
2011-02-06T00:38:06  <contestbot> amstan: repo = https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:38:08  <McLeopold> dang, how do you do the crying emoticon
2011-02-06T00:38:15  <j3camero> Lovely.
2011-02-06T00:38:22  <McLeopold> :`(
2011-02-06T00:38:27  <amstan> i'll be working on the wiki now
2011-02-06T00:38:32  <j3camero> @repo
2011-02-06T00:38:33  <contestbot> j3camero: repo = https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:38:34  <j3camero> repo
2011-02-06T00:38:38  <j3camero> awesome
2011-02-06T00:38:41  <McLeopold> :'(
2011-02-06T00:38:42  <j3camero> repo
2011-02-06T00:38:47  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: was that cherrypicking remark about git stuff or game stuff?
2011-02-06T00:38:48  <j3camero> @repo
2011-02-06T00:38:49  <contestbot> j3camero: repo = https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T00:38:54  <McLeopold> game stuff
2011-02-06T00:39:13  <j3camero> scoring based on food eaten discourages camping.
2011-02-06T00:39:14  <McLeopold> so, I think I favor kills.
2011-02-06T00:39:22  <McLeopold> maybe we could do kills and births?
2011-02-06T00:39:22  <antimatroid> j3camero: i think who killed who might be a bit hard to work out?
2011-02-06T00:39:25  <McLeopold> combined
2011-02-06T00:39:36  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it's not
2011-02-06T00:39:41  <jmcarthur> change what you score for each game :D
2011-02-06T00:39:42  <amstan> there we go: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/_pages
2011-02-06T00:39:45  <antimatroid> McLeopold: in that case go for it
2011-02-06T00:39:53  <j3camero> antimatroid: you could go with ants lost instead. Would be pretty much the same.
2011-02-06T00:39:57  <McLeopold> I'm removing groups at a time, so everyone in the group gets credit for a percentage of the total kill value
2011-02-06T00:39:58  <antimatroid> a death is a kill?
2011-02-06T00:40:15  <jmcarthur> a frag, you mean :P
2011-02-06T00:40:22  <amstan> hold on.. i still have to give access
2011-02-06T00:40:27  <jbroman> amstan: I can has access?
2011-02-06T00:40:33  <McLeopold> a death is a point, I think jmcarthur made fun of me for suggesting that
2011-02-06T00:40:37  <antimatroid> i still like the idea of having ant hill that also net points and have a view radius, but it's maybe getting a bit like that snowballs snowmen then
2011-02-06T00:40:51  <amstan> organizations don't work they same way.. apparently they have teams
2011-02-06T00:40:59  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: oh, right, that one where you try to suicide your ants while not being wiped out
2011-02-06T00:41:08  <McLeopold> yep
2011-02-06T00:41:32  <McLeopold> if you sit in the corner gaining ants, but don't use them, you don't get points
2011-02-06T00:41:37  <j3camero> I think the anthills are a distraction, since it only takes one ant to accupy them (costs nothing).
2011-02-06T00:41:46  <McLeopold> but then, kills will do that to, since it is 1:1 or greater
2011-02-06T00:41:52  <jbroman> amstan: Yeah. Assign users to teams, give teams some level of access to repos.
2011-02-06T00:41:55  <j3camero> If you sit in the corner, you quickly stop getting new ants too.
2011-02-06T00:42:15  <McLeopold> j3camero, not really.
2011-02-06T00:42:38  <McLeopold> if you hold on to a small piece of land, and don't fight, you should slowly accumulate more than the opponents who are fighting
2011-02-06T00:42:49  <McLeopold> then you can rush them
2011-02-06T00:42:50  <amstan> who's  apinkin again?
2011-02-06T00:43:02  <amstan> pgpaskar_: want commit access?
2011-02-06T00:43:05  <j3camero> Anecdotally, if you camp on a small patch of land, you quickly die.
2011-02-06T00:43:17  <McLeopold> only if attacked
2011-02-06T00:43:37  <amstan> jbroman: done, i think
2011-02-06T00:43:37  <j3camero> amstan: just hand out commit access to anybody in this channel for now. Whatever. Worst case we can clean up after a vandal.
2011-02-06T00:44:00  <antimatroid> so... points for every ant you get and every death?
2011-02-06T00:44:02  <McLeopold> um, you can just pull in our changes from forks
2011-02-06T00:44:12  <antimatroid> or is every going for mass fights at the end?
2011-02-06T00:44:19  <jmcarthur> 1 point per ant-turn
2011-02-06T00:44:20  <amstan> j3camero: accoun is in the channel...
2011-02-06T00:44:29  <jmcarthur> you get a point for every ant you have on each turn
2011-02-06T00:44:35  <jmcarthur> that would avoid combat though
2011-02-06T00:44:35  <antimatroid> i like that
2011-02-06T00:44:42  <j3camero> amstan: exercise some judgement, but hand out commit access liberally.
2011-02-06T00:44:49  <amstan> j3camero: and since this is github they don't need push access actually
2011-02-06T00:44:53  <McLeopold> amstan: just let us fork the project, then you can watch changes and pull in the ones you like
2011-02-06T00:45:00  <amstan> j3camero: they can fork at any time, make their changes, then pull what we want
2011-02-06T00:45:05  <jmcarthur> but there would be benefits to getting 1:3 kills and stuff that way
2011-02-06T00:45:07  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: combat is for getting more territory for food?
2011-02-06T00:45:08  <j3camero> k sounds good
2011-02-06T00:45:28  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yes, or for that (rare?) case that you can kill more enemies than your own
2011-02-06T00:45:28  <amstan> j3camero: we should get a public email for @ai-contest
2011-02-06T00:45:38  <antimatroid> i say go with one point per ant per turn for the moment and see how it goes in early testing...
2011-02-06T00:45:40  <amstan> j3camero: pr@ ? lol
2011-02-06T00:45:58  <j3camero> amstan: we already have the @ai-contest.com email addresses better to use those.
2011-02-06T00:46:16  <amstan> yeah, but this should be a publicly usable email
2011-02-06T00:46:21  <amstan> something like.. info@
2011-02-06T00:46:28  <jmcarthur> admin@
2011-02-06T00:46:31  <amstan> similar to exec@csclub
2011-02-06T00:46:35  <McLeopold> 266 turns with no food conflict, it looks like an edge case
2011-02-06T00:46:55  <j3camero> No man just put the CSC office phone number. They love getting calls from disenchanted contestants I hear.
2011-02-06T00:46:57  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ?
2011-02-06T00:47:00  <McLeopold> I'll get kill group stats soon
2011-02-06T00:47:23  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: if food is in range of 2 different ants, remove it
2011-02-06T00:47:32  <jmcarthur> oh that's what you're talking about
2011-02-06T00:48:10  <amstan> j3camero: oh man.. i got in trouble for that actually, lol
2011-02-06T00:48:24  <amstan> you know csc... always blame amstan
2011-02-06T00:49:43  <j3camero> lol. How is it your fault that some crazy person called the office?
2011-02-06T00:50:05  <amstan> j3camero: it was about those damn school/organizations updates
2011-02-06T00:50:29  <jbroman> There was no obvious way to contact contest organizers on the website
2011-02-06T00:50:32  <j3camero> Who cares what it was about. It was just some crazy dude.
2011-02-06T00:50:46  <jbroman> Therefore everyone saw "Computer Science Club" on the site and looked up that contact info.
2011-02-06T00:51:01  <McLeopold> Maybe a "submit your org name" page?
2011-02-06T00:51:06  <amstan> j3camero: actually.. it was the ceo for some gaming company that ebering had personal contact with
2011-02-06T00:51:10  <antimatroid> wait hang on, someone called uw about updating organisations for the ai contest?
2011-02-06T00:51:15  <antimatroid> that is gold
2011-02-06T00:51:23  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, was in the office at the time
2011-02-06T00:51:28  <jbroman> antimatroid: The CEO of a game producing company.
2011-02-06T00:51:43  <McLeopold> did you get free games?
2011-02-06T00:51:56  <amstan> anyway.. moving on..
2011-02-06T00:52:05  <j3camero> Yeah I remember who he was. But cmon. We don't have to attach any legitimacy to his craziness just because he is the CEO of something or other.
2011-02-06T00:52:10  <amstan> who is apinkin???
2011-02-06T00:52:13  <jbroman> McLeopold: For not responding promptly to forum posts.
2011-02-06T00:52:19  <amstan> this is driving me crazy, lol
2011-02-06T00:52:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold: if ant's aren't to have id, you could almost just print each player a char map each turn
2011-02-06T00:52:38  <McLeopold> probably
2011-02-06T00:52:41  <jbroman> j3camero: In fairness, he said that he had tried to get the org added, was told "go away, post in the other forum", posted there, and days later nothing had been done.
2011-02-06T00:53:00  <antimatroid> it'd mean a lot less input to receive...
2011-02-06T00:53:01  <jbroman> I realize it was chaotic by that point, but he wasn't crazy.
2011-02-06T00:53:22  <j3camero> And people were all like "the presence of crazy people on this planet means that Jeff must be doing a horrible job with the AI contest" and other equally brilliant inferences.
2011-02-06T00:53:43  <McLeopold> you did go awl
2011-02-06T00:53:59  <jbroman> j3camero: OK, I think we're done here.
2011-02-06T00:54:06  <jbroman> If we want to relive that thread,
2011-02-06T00:54:09  <antimatroid> can we talk input people?
2011-02-06T00:54:11  <jbroman> we can read our email histories.
2011-02-06T00:54:14  <McLeopold> no, lets talk ants
2011-02-06T00:54:15  <antimatroid> i'm writing a bot
2011-02-06T00:54:15  <McLeopold> or git
2011-02-06T00:54:39  <McLeopold> 903 turns, the movie might be too big for imgur
2011-02-06T00:54:52  <antimatroid> try imageshack otherwise, they always did me well
2011-02-06T00:57:52  <McLeopold> 903 turns, with a high score of 41.  HunterBot doesn't understand hills...
2011-02-06T00:58:07  <pgpaskar_> amstan: perhaps later, if i can even contribute much
2011-02-06T00:58:25  <antimatroid> McLeopold: oh god, you've gone and indexed things x y :(
2011-02-06T00:58:46  <antimatroid> j3camero: take note, grids should be indexed [row][col] not [x][y]!!
2011-02-06T00:58:57  <amstan> this dimkadimon, he just replies to every topic possible on the suggestions forum
2011-02-06T00:59:01  <j3camero> Meh, as long as its consistent.
2011-02-06T00:59:04  <antimatroid> amstan: yep :
2011-02-06T00:59:24  <amstan> j3camero: actually.. it should be a[y][x]
2011-02-06T00:59:25  <McLeopold> how about lat and long?
2011-02-06T00:59:29  <amstan> if you wanna print it you're screwed
2011-02-06T00:59:56  <jmcarthur> [y][x] is far superior
2011-02-06T01:00:27  *** elimisteve is now known as elimisteve_fake
2011-02-06T01:00:29  <j3camero> How does numpy do it?
2011-02-06T01:00:33  <j3camero> x,y right?
2011-02-06T01:00:34  *** elimisteve_fake is now known as elimisteve
2011-02-06T01:00:36  <j3camero> For arrays?
2011-02-06T01:00:38  <McLeopold> howevery you want
2011-02-06T01:00:49  <amstan> j3camero: numpy is weird.. it has a matrix datastructure
2011-02-06T01:00:50  <antimatroid> arrays are matrices
2011-02-06T01:00:56  <antimatroid> matrices should be indexed row, col
2011-02-06T01:01:06  <antimatroid> and it's easier for printing both maps and debugging stuff
2011-02-06T01:01:11  <antimatroid> it just makes life easier
2011-02-06T01:01:21  <jmcarthur> and in lower level languages is also faster
2011-02-06T01:01:25  <jmcarthur> due to locality
2011-02-06T01:01:45  <jmcarthur> at least considering that you typically care about row operations, not column
2011-02-06T01:01:57  <McLeopold> we care about both
2011-02-06T01:02:01  <chris___0076> well, PIl uses: [x, y]
2011-02-06T01:02:04  <jmcarthur> and when you do care about column operations, *then* you decide whether to transpose for it or not
2011-02-06T01:02:37  <j3camero> Okay final call: should we call this thing ants or zombies?
2011-02-06T01:02:39  *** chris___0076 is now known as chris_0076
2011-02-06T01:02:48  <j3camero> I vote zombies, because it will instantly double pageviews.
2011-02-06T01:02:48  <antimatroid> oh... with the current radius for fighting, can you fight something through a wall?
2011-02-06T01:02:49  <jmcarthur> monkeys and bananas
2011-02-06T01:02:55  <antimatroid> j3camero: not zombies
2011-02-06T01:02:56  <jmcarthur> it doesn't really matter
2011-02-06T01:03:00  *** tapwater <tapwater!~tapwater@pool-173-74-225-160.dllstx.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: tapwater)
2011-02-06T01:03:07  <j3camero> antimatroid: elaborate
2011-02-06T01:03:15  <antimatroid> it's so overdone
2011-02-06T01:03:32  <antimatroid> ants has been a running theme, i don't mind but i don't see why change?
2011-02-06T01:03:40  <j3camero> Dude. You get to write an AI whose job is to survive a zombie attack.
2011-02-06T01:03:51  <antimatroid> ... as zombies
2011-02-06T01:04:06  <antimatroid> fighting ant colonies makes slightly more sense
2011-02-06T01:04:17  <jmcarthur> nothing about this game screams "zombie" to me
2011-02-06T01:05:45  <j3camero> Which is more likely to get clicked on Reddit: ants or zombies? :-P
2011-02-06T01:05:53  <jmcarthur> boobs
2011-02-06T01:05:57  <j3camero> hmmmm
2011-02-06T01:05:57  <jmcarthur> but that's not gonna work
2011-02-06T01:06:00  <j3camero> you make a good point sir
2011-02-06T01:06:07  <antimatroid> i think reddit would go for ants
2011-02-06T01:06:16  <antimatroid> not necessarily over the top of zombies
2011-02-06T01:06:20  <antimatroid> but i think ants has the appeal
2011-02-06T01:06:28  <antimatroid> they get excited over any shit like this
2011-02-06T01:06:29  <amstan> j3camero: i could not get the guy with the ants artwork onboard, he expected money: http://www.johnny3d.promail.ca/iak/iak.png
2011-02-06T01:06:30  <McLeopold> hmm... killing through walls?
2011-02-06T01:06:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold
2011-02-06T01:06:51  <antimatroid> aXb?
2011-02-06T01:06:56  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-06T01:06:59  <antimatroid> imagine more X's above and below if you want
2011-02-06T01:07:14  <antimatroid> do they die?
2011-02-06T01:07:41  <McLeopold> if I'm looking for connected ants, it might not be to hard to check a few points between for walls
2011-02-06T01:07:51  <j3camero> This could be the logo: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_05RmVdK-3OY/SUbZFoTqOkI/AAAAAAAAAfo/fqASa0n6_iU/s400/ZombieKidcolored-1.jpg
2011-02-06T01:08:19  <jmcarthur> if we did manhattan distance we could factor in walls a bit more easily
2011-02-06T01:08:24  <McLeopold> "All your brain are belong to us"
2011-02-06T01:08:34  <antimatroid> i think for zombies you'd need to have "killed" agents changing sides
2011-02-06T01:08:34  <jbroman> Zombies seems unnecessarily contrived. Ants is the name we've used so far, and I think it makes sense.
2011-02-06T01:08:39  <antimatroid> which would be messy with n player
2011-02-06T01:08:44  <jmcarthur> it might not *always* make sense, but walls would be attack blockers at least, except around corners
2011-02-06T01:08:47  <amstan> McLeopold: it can apply to any game: all your colonies are belong to us
2011-02-06T01:09:00  <McLeopold> I'm doing real distance
2011-02-06T01:09:05  <amstan> McLeopold: all your paper, all your cycles
2011-02-06T01:09:14  <antimatroid> i would use manhatten distance
2011-02-06T01:09:25  <j3camero> lol RPS. Seems like such a poor game choice looking back.
2011-02-06T01:09:27  <antimatroid> that's the metric used for travel distance, why not just use it for everything?
2011-02-06T01:09:32  <amstan> k, let's have a vote
2011-02-06T01:09:52  <j3camero> It looks like ants is the consensus here.
2011-02-06T01:10:02  <antimatroid> j3camero: i always play rock in real life, i find most people play scissors
2011-02-06T01:10:09  <j3camero> So what do we actually call it? Ant Wars doesn't sound right to me.
2011-02-06T01:10:25  <McLeopold> But Planet Wars does:
2011-02-06T01:10:29  <antimatroid> Colony Wars?

2011-02-06T01:22:16  <Zannick> AntZombieRiot
2011-02-06T01:22:23  <jbroman> Yeah, I keep going back to Ants.
2011-02-06T01:22:24  <j3camero> I am leaning towards ants
2011-02-06T01:22:33  <j3camero> Not ant war or anything. Just ants.

2011-02-06T01:24:12  <jmcarthur> a C&D is actually a great way to get publicity
2011-02-06T01:24:21  <jmcarthur> if you whine and complain
2011-02-06T01:24:31  <antimatroid> reddit laps that shit up
2011-02-06T01:24:39  <jmcarthur> and then go ahead and change the name like you lost
2011-02-06T01:24:41  <jmcarthur> big headlines
2011-02-06T01:24:53  <jmcarthur> or "fight it" which is even better
2011-02-06T01:25:00  <j3camero> Oh my god can we arrange to have someone send us a C&D letter?
2011-02-06T01:25:04  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-02-06T01:25:10  <amstan> jmcarthur: like pidgin did?
2011-02-06T01:25:20  <jmcarthur> what did pidgin do?
2011-02-06T01:25:28  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Became Pidgin.
2011-02-06T01:25:29  <j3camero> Dude we could just make up some company that has a reason to not like us and write ourselves a letter. Put that up on reddit = instant karma and more contestants.

2011-02-06T01:29:11  <j3camero> What's great is that we could then go on Reddit with throwaway accounts and do a "It's shit like this, Google" post to out ourselves and that would get even MOAR pageviews :-D
2011-02-06T01:29:11  <antimatroid> so.. are we using mcleopolds engine or starting fresh or going with what j3camero had?
2011-02-06T01:29:22  <jmcarthur> amstan: you hang out in circles that i don't then :P
2011-02-06T01:29:48  <jmcarthur> McLeopold's was throwaway to begin with i think
2011-02-06T01:29:55  <j3camero> so was mine
2011-02-06T01:29:58  <jmcarthur> and it's based on j3camero's
2011-02-06T01:30:06  <jmcarthur> so starting fresh i assume
2011-02-06T01:30:10  <j3camero> I think I'm just starting anew.
2011-02-06T01:30:19  <j3camero> Like, we didn't have anything that's any use.
2011-02-06T01:30:43  <antimatroid> Can I write up some io rules for you then? and then everyone can critique?
2011-02-06T01:30:51  <j3camero> Yup for sure.
2011-02-06T01:31:04  <McLeopold> Mines getting there
2011-02-06T01:31:06  <amstan> didn't we decide on json?
2011-02-06T01:31:11  <McLeopold> It's not a bad start
2011-02-06T01:31:34  <j3camero> Oh hell no.
2011-02-06T01:31:46  <McLeopold> wow, what's wrong with json?
2011-02-06T01:32:00  <j3camero> Nothing's wrong with it.
2011-02-06T01:32:05  <jmcarthur> i think there was a bit of consensus on key value1 value2 value3\n
2011-02-06T01:32:11  <janzert> means every noob has to set up a library to compile with there favorite language
2011-02-06T01:32:34  <antimatroid> janzert: welcome to the party :)
2011-02-06T01:32:37  <j3camero> It's a dependency, which does not fly with starter packages. Starter packages have to "just work" in the worst kind of way.
2011-02-06T01:32:46  <jmcarthur> but i think most people agreed that it would make sense if we used json to just stick the libs and a complete build env in the starter packs
2011-02-06T01:32:48  <McLeopold> makes sense
2011-02-06T01:32:51  <amstan> janzert: the solution for that was to include the library in the starter package, as maybe 1 file
2011-02-06T01:32:55  <antimatroid> io is easy anyway, i've never understood the json idea
2011-02-06T01:33:24  <j3camero> It's just way too big a hammer for the problem. We can avoid using JSON here.
2011-02-06T01:33:32  <jmcarthur> json just takes the thinking out of the communication format and it's extensible
2011-02-06T01:33:33  <j3camero> MESSAGETYPE freeformtext
2011-02-06T01:33:38  * janzert is just lurking watching things go by through the fog of nasty head cold :/
2011-02-06T01:33:41  <McLeopold> its the smallest hammer available
2011-02-06T01:33:52  <jmcarthur> but yeah, the simple type-tagged lines format is fine, IMO
2011-02-06T01:33:54  <j3camero> MAP 34 56 TRUE
2011-02-06T01:33:57  <jmcarthur> as long as it's consistently used
2011-02-06T01:34:11  <j3camero> ANT id x y
2011-02-06T01:34:25  <McLeopold> no ids!
2011-02-06T01:34:26  <jmcarthur> uppercase hurts my eyes :P
2011-02-06T01:34:40  <j3camero> Dude caps lock is cruise control for cool.
2011-02-06T01:34:44  <amstan> +1 for uppercase being eye hurtful

2011-02-06T01:35:47  <Zannick> ANT player_id x y
2011-02-06T01:35:54  <Zannick> is probably more what you want
2011-02-06T01:36:05  <jmcarthur> ant x y
2011-02-06T01:36:13  <Zannick> or something like that
2011-02-06T01:36:54  <j3camero> so i created an ants directory, git added it. But when I try to git commit it says there's nothing to commit.
2011-02-06T01:37:05  <jmcarthur> git likes files

2011-02-06T01:37:25  <amstan> j3camero: git doesn't track folders, add files in it and it'll like you
2011-02-06T01:38:22  <j3camero> thats messed up
2011-02-06T01:39:00  <j3camero> Hey if we all just have code files on our computers and we send them back and forth by email, is that a DVCS?
2011-02-06T01:39:02  <Zannick> which branch is being used for ants?
2011-02-06T01:39:22  <jbroman> j3camero: You kid, but the kernel team did just that (well, with patches) for a long time.
2011-02-06T01:39:28  <McLeopold> okay, pushed latest changes to git
2011-02-06T01:39:46  <jmcarthur> email for patches is a common thing in darcs, actually
2011-02-06T01:39:55  <amstan> Zannick: if we're extending the ants idea that jeff initiated, then simpleants
2011-02-06T01:39:56  <jmcarthur> although darcsden at least has forking a la github
2011-02-06T01:40:31  <jmcarthur> git does also support the email workflow
2011-02-06T01:40:34  <McLeopold> you guys are going to hate my distance code, though
2011-02-06T01:40:39  <j3camero> Man, I just really love SVN.
2011-02-06T01:40:44  <jmcarthur> ...
2011-02-06T01:40:49  <McLeopold> did we decide on mannhat distance?
2011-02-06T01:40:51  * jmcarthur punchifies j3camero in the face
2011-02-06T01:40:58  <j3camero> haha okay okay
2011-02-06T01:41:01  <j3camero> </troll>
2011-02-06T01:41:06  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: no decision was made i think
2011-02-06T01:41:25  <amstan> j3camero: have you seen this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 , see this!
2011-02-06T01:42:43  <j3camero> Aw man 1:10:15
2011-02-06T01:42:49  <j3camero> TL;DR?
2011-02-06T01:43:17  <jbroman> j3camero: "Git is awesome and everything else is stupid." ~Linus Torvalds
2011-02-06T01:43:34  <j3camero> Okay when I do git status it say "On branch pw". Is this normal? Should I maybe be working on some other branch?
2011-02-06T01:43:51  <jmcarthur> this one is much shorter ;)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOGmwA5yBn0
2011-02-06T01:44:14  <jbroman> j3camero: Currently, the default branch is "pw".
2011-02-06T01:44:15  <jmcarthur> but more boring overall
2011-02-06T01:44:19  <Zannick> j3camero: that's up to you. pw has all the code from last time
2011-02-06T01:44:24  <jbroman> You can checkout other branches if you want to work on them.
2011-02-06T01:44:29  <antimatroid> j3camero, McLeopold: http://pastebin.com/0VErj4qF
2011-02-06T01:44:38  <Zannick> but simpleants is where you previously put the ants stuff
2011-02-06T01:44:38  <antimatroid> that's what I imagine would work well?
2011-02-06T01:44:43  <amstan> j3camero: if you want to work on ants do "git checkout -b simpleants origin/simpleants"
2011-02-06T01:45:35  <amstan> we'll later merge ants into whatever contest framework we want to use
2011-02-06T01:45:39  <McLeopold> amstan: I did that command with remotes.  did I need that?
2011-02-06T01:46:08  <amstan> McLeopold: not sure
2011-02-06T01:46:41  <McLeopold> @repo
2011-02-06T01:46:41  <contestbot> McLeopold: repo = https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T01:47:12  <McLeopold> did you guys get control of that yet?
2011-02-06T01:47:12  <antimatroid> oh, and each player is to return "go\n" at the end of each turn including turn 0
2011-02-06T01:47:19  <McLeopold> or is the repo somewhere else?
2011-02-06T01:47:29  <amstan> McLeopold: yep, it's ours
2011-02-06T01:47:42  <McLeopold> should I see jeff's changes yet?
2011-02-06T01:47:52  <amstan> McLeopold: if he pushed
2011-02-06T01:48:03  <McLeopold> dang, it's forked from yours
2011-02-06T01:48:35  <amstan> McLeopold: so?
2011-02-06T01:49:04  <McLeopold> sweet, I'm connected on the fork graph, so you can pull my changes
2011-02-06T01:49:18  <McLeopold> can you do that from github itself?
2011-02-06T01:50:10  <amstan> i'm looking into it
2011-02-06T01:50:22  <amstan> you know what.. i'll just do it locally, safer then
2011-02-06T01:51:04  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what do you think of that io? it would make it simpler i think
2011-02-06T01:51:15  <antimatroid> i accidentally copied across that stuff from the bottom
2011-02-06T01:51:47  <McLeopold> you on etherpad?
2011-02-06T01:52:01  <antimatroid> hang on, i'll put it there
2011-02-06T01:52:09  <amstan> McLeopold: what's with all these txt files?
2011-02-06T01:52:28  <amstan> and html?

2011-02-06T01:53:01  <McLeopold> it's for debugging
2011-02-06T01:53:38  <amstan> it's rather disorganized
2011-02-06T01:53:52  <McLeopold> well, yeah
2011-02-06T01:53:58  <McLeopold> I was following the leader...
2011-02-06T01:54:46  <McLeopold> so, the value is in the ant_map.py file
2011-02-06T01:55:17  <McLeopold> as soon as bots are properly setup with a communication protocol, then you can get rid of the deepcopy stuff and speed it up
2011-02-06T01:56:05  <amstan> so why is there txt files and png files for maps now?
2011-02-06T01:56:35  <antimatroid> because .txt is easier :P

2011-02-06T01:57:32  <McLeopold> I think it is useful to prefix the lines with a letter, like we did before
2011-02-06T01:58:23  <antimatroid> if you do it like that, it's not necessary
2011-02-06T01:58:34  <McLeopold> what you wrote is good
2011-02-06T01:58:41  <McLeopold> I think that covers it
2011-02-06T01:58:51  <McLeopold> except for matching up coordinates, maybe?
2011-02-06T01:59:31  <McLeopold> should we send text of the entire map and have '?' chars be unexplored?

2011-02-06T02:06:30  <j3camero> Gonna have some tea and read cheap sci fi novels then go to sleep.
2011-02-06T02:08:48  <j3camero> Oh sweet I did a commit and a push.
2011-02-06T02:09:26  <j3camero> God damn github has a nice interface. Is there anything like this but open source that I could set up at work?
2011-02-06T02:09:31  <j3camero> Right now I'm using InDefero.
2011-02-06T02:09:35  <Zannick> oh, cia is following amstan/aichallenge
2011-02-06T02:09:39  <Zannick> and not aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T02:09:44  <amstan> Zannick: yeah.. about to fix
2011-02-06T02:12:27  <amstan> j3camero: so you don't want to do that merging idea? and still continue working in the simpleants branch/
2011-02-06T02:13:30  <amstan> j3camero: i was thinking to do everything ants related in this branch: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/simpleants
2011-02-06T02:13:36  <amstan> j3camero: even delete everything there and start over
2011-02-06T02:13:43  <amstan> j3camero: then merge it into that pw branch
2011-02-06T02:28:44  <j3camero> Why have a different branch for this contest?
2011-02-06T02:28:50  <j3camero> Why not just a different directory?
2011-02-06T02:29:38  <amstan> j3camero: merging
2011-02-06T02:30:12  <jbroman> j3camero: Do you mean "I am merging them", or "They are in different branches due to merging"?
2011-02-06T02:30:25  <jbroman> amstan*
2011-02-06T02:30:45  <amstan> jbroman: so it's easy to merge stuff later
2011-02-06T02:31:21  <amstan> jbroman: when someone wants to fork/branch the code because of a change in the ants engine they'll want to work on ants, and not have to worry about other stuff like the website
2011-02-06T02:31:52  <amstan> i guess it could work..
2011-02-06T02:32:37  <jbroman> So the "cd" into the ants subdir?
2011-02-06T02:32:47  <jbroman> And merging is particularly trivial for changes to separate files.
2011-02-06T02:32:58  <amstan> fine
2011-02-06T02:37:34  <McLeopold> amstan: in what branch did jeff create the ants/readme file?
2011-02-06T02:37:43  <amstan> McLeopold: master
2011-02-06T02:38:32  <McLeopold> well crap, I do "git checkout master" and I get the simpleants stuff?
2011-02-06T02:39:27  <amstan> McLeopold: wait.. darn, sorry
2011-02-06T02:39:30  <amstan> McLeopold: not master, pw
2011-02-06T02:39:53  <McLeopold> doesn't that stand for planet wars?
2011-02-06T02:40:10  <amstan> yes, it should have been renamed
2011-02-06T02:40:24  <McLeopold> to "current contest"?
2011-02-06T02:40:29  <amstan> yes
2011-02-06T02:40:33  <McLeopold> okay
2011-02-06T02:40:59  <amstan> epsilon and zeta
2011-02-06T02:41:06  <amstan> i'll do that tomorrow
2011-02-06T02:41:20  <McLeopold> hmm... I'm not getting his file?
2011-02-06T02:41:35  <amstan> McLeopold: make sure you have origin set to aichallenge/aichallenge
2011-02-06T02:42:07  <McLeopold> Well, I don't have commit access directly, so I'm going off of my fork.
2011-02-06T02:42:16  <amstan> make sure your fork is up to date then
2011-02-06T02:42:48  <McLeopold> I've done "git remote add official https://gitgub.com/aichallenge/aichallenge.git"
2011-02-06T02:42:58  <amstan> git checkout master
2011-02-06T02:43:04  <amstan> git pull official master
2011-02-06T02:43:22  <McLeopold> I thought you said pw?
2011-02-06T02:43:22  <amstan> darn!
2011-02-06T02:43:24  <amstan> pw
2011-02-06T02:43:27  <amstan> yes
2011-02-06T02:43:30  <McLeopold> bam, there it is
2011-02-06T02:43:43  <amstan> this is so confusing, lol
2011-02-06T02:43:49  <j3camero> lol
2011-02-06T02:43:53  <amstan> we have to make sure we have properly defined terms
2011-02-06T02:43:54  <McLeopold> I'm getting it...
2011-02-06T02:44:02  <amstan> master and pw are bad, lol
2011-02-06T02:44:52  <Zannick> past, present, fruture
2011-02-06T02:44:54  <Zannick> future *
2011-02-06T02:44:55  <McLeopold> if I "git checkout pw" then "git fetch official" it should do the same thing?
2011-02-06T02:45:18  <amstan> McLeopold: fetch only downloads the changes, doesn't merge them in the branch
2011-02-06T02:45:30  <amstan> the branch will still point to the old changes
2011-02-06T02:45:47  <amstan> fetch+merge=pull
2011-02-06T02:45:53  <McLeopold> okay
2011-02-06T02:46:04  <McLeopold> but I could pull, then merge and still be ok
2011-02-06T02:46:20  <amstan> ugh..
2011-02-06T02:46:21  <McLeopold> i mean, fetch, then pull
2011-02-06T02:46:27  <McLeopold> dang!
2011-02-06T02:46:30  <McLeopold> nevermind
2011-02-06T02:46:52  <amstan> "git pull official pw" =  "git fetch official" + "git merge official/pw"

2011-02-06T02:53:04  <amstan> mine's not going to be used anymore though
2011-02-06T02:53:10  <amstan> it's there for backwards compatibility
2011-02-06T02:53:17  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-06T03:37:02  <Zannick> are we still using the apache license for code?
2011-02-06T03:42:13  <j3camero> No.
2011-02-06T03:43:17  <Zannick> any particular license? i tend to use gpl for the things i post publicly
2011-02-06T03:44:54  <antimatroid> oh... are you actually giving relative information?
2011-02-06T03:44:58  <antimatroid> that can suck for debugging

2011-02-06T03:45:33  <Zannick> huh?
2011-02-06T03:45:54  <j3camero> gpl tends to suck for commercial stuff. But it's awesome for non-profit stuff.
2011-02-06T03:46:22  <j3camero> There is always WTFPL http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/
2011-02-06T03:47:22  <j3camero> Does anyone know if WTFPL is an actual legal license? If so, I am totally down.
2011-02-06T03:48:21  <Zannick> i doubt "do what the fuck you want to" is the correct legal wording for it
2011-02-06T03:50:00  <janzert> sure, it's a 'legal' license. But I'm pretty sure it's never been tested in court to see if the legal meaning is what you think it means :P
2011-02-06T03:50:25  <j3camero> Has the GPL?
2011-02-06T03:51:05  <Zannick> i can barely even imagine how the wtfpl would land in court
2011-02-06T03:51:16  <janzert> I'm not sure any of the times the GPL went to court it has come down to an actual decision
2011-02-06T03:51:39  <Zannick> maybe if someone who put something under the wtfpl decided to reassert under the bern convention or something
2011-02-06T03:51:53  <j3camero> Let's do it.
2011-02-06T03:51:54  <Zannick> which would be extremely silly
2011-02-06T03:51:56  <janzert> Zannick: yeah, that would seem to be about it
2011-02-06T03:52:26  <Zannick> i personally am not really a fan, but sure
2011-02-06T03:54:43  * janzert has MIT as his preferred license but doesn't really care much
2011-02-06T03:55:02  <Zannick> it matters so little
2011-02-06T03:55:09  <janzert> yep
2011-02-06T03:55:19  <Zannick> well, in general
2011-02-06T03:55:25  <Zannick> in this case
2011-02-06T03:55:40  <Zannick> er, i'm tired
2011-02-06T03:55:43  * Zannick sleep
2011-02-06T03:55:53  <j3camero> janert: why do you like MIT in particular?
2011-02-06T03:57:23  <janzert> basically it has about the fewest restrictions on what anyone can do with it, while still being a serious license
2011-02-06T03:57:51  <janzert> also it's popular enough that a lot of people will know right off what it is
2011-02-06T03:57:58  <janzert> and it's nice and short :)
2011-02-06T03:58:28  <janzert> at least those are a few things off the top of my head :P
2011-02-06T04:02:18  <j3camero> How is it better than BSD or Apache?
2011-02-06T04:02:36  <j3camero> They are both pretty short and let you do basically whatever you want.
2011-02-06T04:03:13  <janzert> used to use BSD before MIT came along, it suffers from the confusion over the 3 clause and 2 clause version mostly
2011-02-06T04:03:47  <janzert> and I've never looked into the apache license real close since I'm happy with MIT
2011-02-06T04:04:16  <janzert> and looking at it again, it's nowhere near as short

2011-02-06T04:05:51  <delt0r_> I though that the MIT came first then the BSD
2011-02-06T04:06:01  <delt0r_> thought
2011-02-06T04:06:38  <j3camero> Whoa, there's a license shorter than Apache?
2011-02-06T04:07:37  <janzert> delt0r: hmm, not actually sure when the MIT license first came out
2011-02-06T04:07:50  <janzert> I know BSD has been around since the late 70's
2011-02-06T04:08:08  <janzert> I guess I just became aware of the MIT license several years after BSD
2011-02-06T04:08:30  <janzert> actually wikipedia says MIT license was published in 1988
2011-02-06T04:09:01  <janzert> j3camero: the actual license is a couple of pages long
2011-02-06T04:09:03  <janzert> http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
2011-02-06T04:09:30  <janzert> of course it covers several more situations that the BSD and MIT license don't
2011-02-06T04:09:38  <j3camero> I am impressed with the MIT license. The only requirement is that the permission notice be included. We can deal with that.
2011-02-06T04:10:40  <McLeopold> wow, the engine runs so much faster outside of my virtualbox
2011-02-06T04:12:18  <delt0r_> My understanding is that MIT ~= 2 clause BSD
2011-02-06T04:12:57  <janzert> delt0r_: very close yes
2011-02-06T04:13:40  <janzert> actually it's almost a one clause BSD
2011-02-06T04:14:09  <janzert> it doesn't specifically separate binary redistribution
2011-02-06T04:14:44  <j3camero> Is it "compatible" with GPLv2?
2011-02-06T04:14:51  <janzert> yep
2011-02-06T04:15:04  <janzert> even 2 clause BSD is
2011-02-06T04:15:09  <delt0r_> The FSF asserts that both are
2011-02-06T04:15:29  <janzert> I'm pretty sure that's the primary reason the 2 clause BSD came about actually
2011-02-06T04:16:41  * janzert decides to try the sleep thing again as well

2011-02-06T04:25:45  <janzert> ahh, now that I perused wikipedia some more delt0r is indeed right that the MIT license is older than BSD.
2011-02-06T04:26:08  <janzert> and I was also misremembering that it was the 4-clause to 3-clause change that was made to make it GPL compatible

2011-02-06T04:29:22  <antimatroid> to see if an ant dies: count all ants adjacent enemies, if there is an adjacent enemy whose count is <= a particular ant, it dies
2011-02-06T04:29:45  <delt0r_> McLeopold: Well its kinda known from ecology and hunter gather simulations... gather is better most of the time...
2011-02-06T04:30:37  <delt0r_> antimatroid: I thought thats what McLeopold is using

2011-02-06T04:38:19  <McLeopold> Zombie Ants?
2011-02-06T04:38:23  <antimatroid> i like it
2011-02-06T04:38:24  <delt0r_> oh wait --its all sparkly vampires these days
2011-02-06T04:38:26  <McLeopold> that's perfect
2011-02-06T04:38:28  <j3camero> k but actually we cant call it antz. For serious.
2011-02-06T04:38:33  <antimatroid> how did we miss that
2011-02-06T04:38:57  <antimatroid> my current vote is for zombie ants
2011-02-06T04:39:01  <McLeopold> we need an artist...
2011-02-06T04:39:08  <antimatroid> frontier
2011-02-06T04:39:10  <antimatroid> and delt0r
2011-02-06T04:39:14  <antimatroid> for visualisers
2011-02-06T04:39:22  <delt0r_> welll
2011-02-06T04:39:27  <McLeopold> visualize....pixels
2011-02-06T04:39:34  <delt0r_> I am kinda stupid busy at the moment...
2011-02-06T04:39:34  <antimatroid> delt0r_: i wasn't giving you any choice :P
2011-02-06T04:39:42  <antimatroid> bleh alright
2011-02-06T04:39:56  <antimatroid> someone else must make a jbotmanager for zombie ants
2011-02-06T04:40:06  <j3camero> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_05RmVdK-3OY/SUbZFoTqOkI/AAAAAAAAAfo/fqASa0n6_iU/s400/ZombieKidcolored-1.jpg
2011-02-06T04:40:10  <McLeopold> I was looking forward to your ZombieAnts java utility...
2011-02-06T04:40:21  <delt0r_> however I may still have the time... i do have weekends
2011-02-06T04:40:31  <delt0r_> and the skiing is crap at the moment
2011-02-06T04:40:53  <j3camero> delt0r are you from austrialia or something?
2011-02-06T04:40:54  <antimatroid> we still need ranking stuff yeah?
2011-02-06T04:40:57  <McLeopold> where are you that you can ski?
2011-02-06T04:41:01  <delt0r_> NZer
2011-02-06T04:41:05  <antimatroid> j3camero: it's summer here :P
2011-02-06T04:41:10  <delt0r_> But i live in Austra
2011-02-06T04:41:14  <delt0r_> Austria
2011-02-06T04:41:23  <j3camero> dude the skiing is perfect is autria
2011-02-06T04:41:29  <delt0r_> Too warm
2011-02-06T04:41:35  <delt0r_> lots of ice
2011-02-06T04:41:40  <delt0r_> not enough snow
2011-02-06T04:42:00  <delt0r_> its 10C at the top today at one of the closer fields
2011-02-06T04:42:24  <delt0r_> 2 weeks ago it was -5C at the bottom and -15C at the top
2011-02-06T04:42:37  <delt0r_> which is more like it
2011-02-06T04:42:59  <McLeopold> j3camero: I thought of another question for move resolution.  My current implementation kills ants of the same color if they are sent to the same spot.
2011-02-06T04:43:30  <McLeopold> because there really wasn't a good method for bumping them.
2011-02-06T04:44:20  <McLeopold> I'm thinking it will be nicer for the novice programmers to not have to order their ants' orders.
2011-02-06T04:46:05  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what does ordering moves have to do with it?
2011-02-06T04:46:36  <McLeopold> if you take the bot's moves in order, you can just bump ants if the space isn't clear
2011-02-06T04:46:51  <McLeopold> but then, the bot has to be smart about the order they put their moves in
2011-02-06T04:47:30  <McLeopold> what if a bot wanted to send 4 ants in a circle?
2011-02-06T04:47:50  <McLeopold> it is easier to just move all ants to a new map, and kill dups
2011-02-06T04:48:08  <antimatroid> that last part is what I would have always expected?
2011-02-06T04:48:14  <McLeopold> you don't have to order anything, and you give the bot the largest chance of all moves working
2011-02-06T04:48:27  <antimatroid> yeah, i am not sure why anything would have needed ordering :P
2011-02-06T04:48:35  <antimatroid> that was my issue, all good
2011-02-06T04:48:36  <McLeopold> yes, for bots that do good moves, no problem
2011-02-06T04:48:55  <McLeopold> but some may order to the same spot on accident
2011-02-06T04:49:13  <McLeopold> j3camero: looking for an ok on the above logic
2011-02-06T04:49:59  <McLeopold> http://img145.imageshack.us/i/moviek.gif/

2011-02-06T04:51:57  <antimatroid> it does

2011-02-06T10:36:13  <Meatkat> Also: I still stand 100% behind switching the theme to zombies. In fact from this minute forward I will be assuming said change has already happened.
2011-02-06T10:39:07  <Meatkat> Having zombies running around eating people will increase traffic to the site about approximately 10,000%, it's science.
2011-02-06T10:40:31  <Meatkat> Plus zombies makes a lot more sense. When was the last time you saw ant ant run into a piece of food and instantaneously asexually reproduce?
2011-02-06T10:41:05  <Meatkat> Additionally there is no 'queen' nor is there a 'base' or any sort.
2011-02-06T11:01:00  <jmcarthur> i think i may have found a way to express the current combat algorithm in similar language to how i've been describing mine. maybe if i got this right then it would make a more direct comparison possible
2011-02-06T11:01:10  <jmcarthur> here's mine: A lives if A.opponents.length < A.opponents.map(.opponents.length).minimum
2011-02-06T11:01:20  <jmcarthur> here's the current one: A lives if A.opponents.map(.distanceTo(A)).minimum > A.opponents.map(lambda(E){E.opponents.map(.distanceTo(E)).minimum}).maximum
2011-02-06T11:01:45  <jmcarthur> at least i think that's the one we have in there right now
2011-02-06T11:01:54  <jmcarthur> it's the last one we discussed and seemed to treat positively

2011-02-06T11:06:13  <jmcarthur> i don't want to start comparing them rigorously until somebody at least verifies that i got it right
2011-02-06T11:06:30  <jmcarthur> i know that formulation isn't the same as the algorithm currently being used
2011-02-06T11:06:39  <jmcarthur> but i think it is equivalent
2011-02-06T11:07:30  <jmcarthur> that was my attempt to make it possible to determine the outcome of a battle from the viewpoint of a single ant
2011-02-06T11:08:59  <jmcarthur> my biggest uncertainty is that i got some "minimum" and "maximum" things switched up, or that i used "<" instead of ">" or something

2011-02-06T11:17:09  <jmcarthur> mine can be simplified to: A lives if A.numOpponents < A.opponents.map(.numOpponents).minimum
2011-02-06T11:17:24  <jmcarthur> and the one i think is being used currently: A lives if A.minDistToOpponent > A.opponents.map(.minDistToOpponent).maximum
2011-02-06T11:17:50  <amstan> any commits?
2011-02-06T11:18:05  <jmcarthur> assuming you define numOpponents and minDistToOpponent for each, of course
2011-02-06T11:18:23  <jmcarthur> dunno, i just got here about 15 minutes ago
2011-02-06T11:18:55  <amstan> nope
2011-02-06T11:19:08  <jmcarthur> i thought of a way to describe the distance-based combat resolution in the same kind of language as my proposed algorithm, so now we can compare them more directly
2011-02-06T11:19:23  <jmcarthur> assuming i got it right

2011-02-06T18:15:16  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'm playing with it now
2011-02-06T18:16:06  <antimatroid> i think it works
2011-02-06T18:16:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: have you seen it?
2011-02-06T18:23:13  <jmcarthur> i'll restate
2011-02-06T18:23:34  <jmcarthur> mine: A lives if A.numOpponents < A.opponents.map(.numOpponents).minimum
2011-02-06T18:23:46  <jmcarthur> current: A lives if A.minDistToOpponent > A.opponents.map(.minDistToOpponent).maximum
2011-02-06T18:23:54  <antimatroid> i still prefer yours
2011-02-06T18:23:57  <jmcarthur> me too
2011-02-06T18:24:14  <jmcarthur> but at least now it's clear that they are related in some way
2011-02-06T18:24:43  <jmcarthur> basically it's just by distance to opponents instead of number of opponents
2011-02-06T18:25:25  <antimatroid> yep, jeff's argument seems to be that it's harder to do anything strategically good to break 1:1 odds with the second and that that's better
2011-02-06T18:25:31  <antimatroid> i argue it does the same thing and that that's bad
2011-02-06T18:25:38  <jmcarthur> agreed
2011-02-06T18:26:28  <antimatroid> i demand a poll! :P
2011-02-06T18:26:28  <jmcarthur> i just don't see why an AI contest would intentionally discourage AI
2011-02-06T18:28:59  <amstan> jmcarthur: it should be easy for begginers as well
2011-02-06T18:29:08  <amstan> do not discredit such contestants
2011-02-06T18:29:12  <antimatroid> amstan: it is, it also provides them a clear path of improvement
2011-02-06T18:29:27  <antimatroid> clearer*
2011-02-06T18:29:54  <jmcarthur> i think it discredits them to assume they want the contest dumbed down for them
2011-02-06T18:30:07  <jmcarthur> actually
2011-02-06T18:30:10  <antimatroid> and it's like playing around with game of life working out how to best position players, everybody loves playing around with that
2011-02-06T18:30:10  <jmcarthur> this is the opposite of that
2011-02-06T18:30:15  <McLeopold> antimatroid: seen what?
2011-02-06T18:30:17  <jmcarthur> this is intentionally making it hard to improve
2011-02-06T18:30:29  <antimatroid> McLeopold: (10:11:45 AM) jmcarthur: mine: A lives if A.numOpponents < A.opponents.map(.numOpponents).minimum
2011-02-06T18:30:29  <antimatroid> (10:11:57 AM) jmcarthur: current: A lives if A.minDistToOpponent > A.opponents.map(.minDistToOpponent).maximum
2011-02-06T18:30:45  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: my formulation of the current rules in relation to the ones we were liking before
2011-02-06T18:31:15  <McLeopold> at least we are back to deterministic
2011-02-06T18:31:19  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-06T18:31:21  <antimatroid> agreed
2011-02-06T18:31:30  <McLeopold> okay, superbowl party, cya
2011-02-06T18:31:39  <antimatroid> ha, americans and their superbowl
2011-02-06T18:31:41  <McLeopold> and I just posted
2011-02-06T18:31:43  <antimatroid> have fun

2011-02-06T18:32:01  <McLeopold> I like the world cup as well.
2011-02-06T18:32:10  * jmcarthur cares about the world cup
2011-02-06T18:32:14  <jmcarthur> sort of
2011-02-06T18:32:18  <jmcarthur> more than the superbowl at least
2011-02-06T18:32:25  <McLeopold> as long as france losses, I'm happy
2011-02-06T18:32:41  <McLeopold> that means the last one was awesome

2011-02-06T18:37:35  <jmcarthur> lol, i should suggest my version in the language of how the current algorithm has been described so far
2011-02-06T18:38:13  <jmcarthur> how about we sort each ant by how many opponents they are fighting and then remove them in groups, starting with the most opponents?
2011-02-06T18:38:43  <jmcarthur> *sort the ants
2011-02-06T18:39:46  <antimatroid> wait what?
2011-02-06T18:40:15  <jmcarthur> i believe that is equivalent to my original algorithm, but described similarly to the current algorithm
2011-02-06T18:40:36  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i think there might be an issue with your wording
2011-02-06T18:40:55  <jmcarthur> the current one goes like:  sort each ant by distance to opponents, then remove them in groups starting with the closest
2011-02-06T18:41:36  <jmcarthur> (it actually goes "sort each pair of ants...", but still)
2011-02-06T18:41:37  <antimatroid> oh wait, nevermind
2011-02-06T18:41:45  <antimatroid> it's confusing :)
2011-02-06T18:41:49  <jmcarthur> right

2011-02-06T18:43:25  <antimatroid> i prefer this way of calculating it with the offense graph
2011-02-06T18:56:25  <antimatroid> i've almost finished the structure for a c++ bot
2011-02-06T19:03:48  <sigh> is ants the official game now?
2011-02-06T19:03:59  <antimatroid> it would seem highly likely
2011-02-06T19:04:42  <sigh> i see
2011-02-06T19:05:00  <antimatroid> we're conflicted over the best conflict resolution algorithm
2011-02-06T19:05:28  <sigh> yeah, that was always going to be tricky
2011-02-06T19:05:40  <antimatroid> (10:11:45 AM) jmcarthur: mine: A lives if A.numOpponents < A.opponents.map(.numOpponents).minimum

2011-02-06T19:05:52  <antimatroid> thoughts? :P
2011-02-06T19:06:13  <antimatroid> the first allows more strategic micro play, the conflict seems to be whether that is good or bad
2011-02-06T19:06:51  <sigh> I think promoting micro is more interesting, as I remember discussing with jmcarthur weeks back
2011-02-06T19:07:05  <antimatroid> jmcarthur and i agree with that
2011-02-06T19:07:32  <antimatroid> some people seem to think that will discourage beginners if they get trampled by better bots
2011-02-06T19:07:52  <sigh> beginners will always get trampled by better bots?
2011-02-06T19:07:54  <antimatroid> but that should happen anyway, at least this gives them another avenue to try their hand at and a clearer path for improvement
2011-02-06T19:08:25  <sigh> beginners got trampled by better bots in planet wars as well
2011-02-06T19:08:32  <antimatroid> and in tron
2011-02-06T19:08:58  <antimatroid> it's also bad for rankings (imo) if games aren't as much about skill but rather luck
2011-02-06T19:09:03  <sigh> yeah
2011-02-06T19:09:04  <sigh> more important is that there is a low barrier to entry
2011-02-06T19:09:43  <sigh> it should be easy start of and improve right at the start
2011-02-06T19:10:03  <antimatroid> yeah, people should be able to make a decent improvement on the starter bot within a couple of days
2011-02-06T19:10:30  <antimatroid> but that's fairly simple, make the starter bots really stupid to start with, then make tutorials that point out some easy improvements
2011-02-06T19:10:40  <sigh> I think more micro helps with that, because you can still making a functioning bot that ignores it, but it is a clear place where people can make improvements
2011-02-06T19:11:08  <antimatroid> i'm going to make a forum post with a pill
2011-02-06T19:11:10  <antimatroid> poll*

2011-02-06T20:27:42  <jbroman> amstan: Hmm?
2011-02-06T20:27:55  <amstan> jbroman: master->zeta, pw->epsilon
2011-02-06T20:28:12  <jbroman> I have not done branch renaming.
2011-02-06T20:29:23  <jbroman> You can still rename them if you wish to do so.
2011-02-06T20:35:22  <amstan> jbroman: sorry about the interruption, but just wanted to ease some of the confusion
2011-02-06T20:35:53  <jbroman> Interesting…why did that blow away my commits?
2011-02-06T20:36:01  <amstan> jbroman: it shouldn't
2011-02-06T20:36:06  <amstan> jbroman: just checkout the new branches
2011-02-06T20:36:14  <jbroman> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/zeta/worker
2011-02-06T20:36:41  <jbroman> I see them not.
2011-02-06T20:36:46  <amstan> ok, i can fix this
2011-02-06T20:37:07  <jbroman> I could of course re-commit them if it comes to that, but it's weird that a rename would be destructive at all.
2011-02-06T20:37:31  <amstan> i think it's because i fetched and didn't merge before renaming
2011-02-06T20:37:45  <amstan> i think a rebase should solve this, but i'm not familiar with them

2011-02-06T20:38:44  <jbroman> <3
2011-02-06T20:41:20  <amstan> jbroman: i see you made use of the logging module, finally some pythonic code in this contest, lol
2011-02-06T20:41:49  <antimatroid> hmmmm might i suggest that the "starter tutorials" guide people to getting their bot running on the tcp server rather than the official this time?
2011-02-06T20:41:59  <antimatroid> it might reduce the number of starter bots left at the end
2011-02-06T20:42:14  <amstan> antimatroid: sure.. but there must be a tcp engine to do
2011-02-06T20:42:21  <amstan> so...
2011-02-06T20:42:26  <jbroman> Making a TCP server is trivial.
2011-02-06T20:42:41  <pgpaskar_> So amstan
2011-02-06T20:42:42  <pgpaskar_> How are things
2011-02-06T20:42:42  <jbroman> You can even share the game-running logic with the rest of the codebase  in theory.
2011-02-06T20:42:45  <antimatroid> amstan: i'm hoping for an official tcp server along with the official visualiser being more like jbotmanager
2011-02-06T20:42:51  <antimatroid> which should make it really easy for people
2011-02-06T20:43:49  <amstan> pgpaskar_: good
2011-02-06T20:45:13  <amstan> jbroman: also.. +1 for tabs
2011-02-06T20:45:47  <jbroman> amstan: Sadly GitHub displays them as width of 8 spaces. Alas…
2011-02-06T20:46:08  <jbroman> antimatroid: It might also be neat to let people "request" matches against specific people they know (ranked or unranked, I am unsure).
2011-02-06T20:47:01  <antimatroid> jbroman: i think we should leave that for the rewrite
2011-02-06T20:47:15  <amstan> antimatroid: we're working on zeta
2011-02-06T20:47:19  <jbroman> antimatroid: Oh, for sure.
2011-02-06T20:47:23  <jbroman> I have Zeta on the brain.
2011-02-06T20:47:34  * antimatroid hasn't really looked at anything for zeta yet
2011-02-06T20:47:46  <antimatroid> i want another contest already :P
2011-02-06T20:48:12  <jbroman> antimatroid: Fear not, most effort is on ants right now.
2011-02-06T20:49:41  <pgpaskar_> Is there an editor with configurable tab lengths per file extension?
2011-02-06T20:50:11  <amstan> pgpaskar_: doesn't vi do this?
2011-02-06T20:50:23  <amstan> pgpaskar_: attaches some metadata at the end of the files though
2011-02-06T20:50:27  <amstan> @botrepo
2011-02-06T20:50:28  <contestbot> amstan: botrepo = http://github.com/amstan/contestbot
2011-02-06T20:50:31  <jbroman> pgpaskar_: TextMate does this. You can almost certainly do it with vim/emacs, too.
2011-02-06T20:50:43  <amstan> pgpaskar_: # vim:set shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 expandtab textwidth=79:
2011-02-06T20:50:59  <pgpaskar_> hmm
2011-02-06T20:50:59  <antimatroid> how bare should a start bot be?
2011-02-06T20:51:10  <amstan> antimatroid: ragebot should be fine
2011-02-06T20:51:43  <antimatroid> i'm more thinking about data structures, i was going to make the strategy even stupider than rage bot
2011-02-06T20:51:57  <jbroman> In my humble opinion, starter bots should mostly serve to show how to use the plumbing (how to find the state of the game, issue orders and such). The strategy need not be non-trivial.
2011-02-06T20:52:14  <antimatroid> jbroman: agreed
2011-02-06T20:52:14  <jbroman> (In fact, complex strategies could be confusing for newbies.)
2011-02-06T20:52:32  <antimatroid> it should be easy for people to make their bot better than the starter bot
2011-02-06T20:52:36  <antimatroid> so they can see quick improvements
2011-02-06T20:53:34  <antimatroid> what if starter bots just wall hugged? it's really easy to improve upon that?

2011-02-06T21:58:44  <jmcarthur> i agree. a starter should be bare minimum, and a tutorial can actually get newbies started with any actual strategy
2011-02-06T22:03:31  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'm making this literally walk into the first '.' square it sees, which leaves the very big improvement of keep painting outwards till you see something interesting, then make that move
2011-02-06T22:08:02  <jmcarthur> is . empty?
2011-02-06T22:15:45  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-06T22:15:50  <antimatroid> it's done i think
2011-02-06T22:16:04  <antimatroid> it wont work till an engine is going with new input format though
2011-02-06T22:16:15  <antimatroid> it seems to work with sample game strings i pass it anyway

2011-02-06T22:22:28  <jmcarthur> i haven't said anything because i don't think i have much to add to what you said
2011-02-06T22:23:08  <antimatroid> yeah that's fine, it's people who haven't really contributed to the conversation that i want a response from

2011-02-06T22:24:35  <jmcarthur> i'm not going to argue about it so strongly anymore. i think i've been unreasonably aggressive and irritable
2011-02-06T22:25:14  <antimatroid> i'm not so much arguing, just after the most interesting game
2011-02-06T22:25:53  <jbroman> I think the new distance-based mechanic is nicer than the previous 1:1 suggestion, so it doesn't matter much to me which of those two get chosen.
2011-02-06T22:29:30  <antimatroid> jbroman: 1:1 is out, it's out of those two
2011-02-06T22:29:36  <antimatroid> i think the first is far more interesting
2011-02-06T22:33:20  <jmcarthur> there may be even better ones to discover
2011-02-06T22:39:25  <jmcarthur> a crazy one that stands no chance of being accepted would be for ants to gain some sort of XP for each kill they get which makes them more powerful over time the longer they survive
2011-02-06T22:39:59  <jmcarthur> which means you'd want to use your weaker ones as fodder in order to maneuver your stronger ones into safe, useful positions
2011-02-06T22:41:04  <antimatroid> hmmm would that be private information?
2011-02-06T22:41:09  <jmcarthur> dunno
2011-02-06T22:41:16  <jmcarthur> i think it could be compelling whether private or not
2011-02-06T22:41:23  <jmcarthur> actually i think it would be better as public information
2011-02-06T22:41:35  <jmcarthur> makes it more tactical and less guessing. guessing would be too crazy i think
2011-02-06T22:42:12  <jmcarthur> unless it's like stratego where the stats are revealed as you fight
2011-02-06T22:42:43  <jmcarthur> but yeah, if somebody said that was too complicated, i might agree...
2011-02-06T22:42:49  <jmcarthur> then again, i like some kinds of complicated
2011-02-06T22:43:14  <antimatroid> i like something that is complicated because it's complicated, not because it's so messy it's complicated
2011-02-06T22:43:22  <jmcarthur> i'd still like to see a game where your bot has to program smaller bots on the fly ;)
2011-02-06T22:43:29  <jmcarthur> yeah that
2011-02-06T22:43:31  <antimatroid> that's how i could best explain my like for pure over applied maths
2011-02-06T22:44:17  <antimatroid> planet wars hit the head on the nail with that respect
2011-02-06T22:45:39  <jbroman> I actually like the idea of writing a limited amount of code that runs for an individual unit. The engine would then run copies of that code for each unit. (Maybe you would write code that runs on an Ant VM? Who knows.) So you don't get centralized control for free – you have to teach your units to co-operate.
2011-02-06T22:45:56  <jbroman> (Crazy idea which definitely doesn't work this contest, or possibly ever. But neat.)
2011-02-06T22:46:07  <antimatroid> jbroman: originally we wanted each ant to run in a separate process, but there'd be tooooo much overhead for that
2011-02-06T22:46:41  <antimatroid> there was even intentions of allowing bots to "communicate", but alas the overhead :(
2011-02-06T22:46:42  <jbroman> antimatroid: Yeah. But if you made a virtual machine which executed some domain-specific bytecode language, you could avoid that problem.
2011-02-06T22:46:57  <antimatroid> i think that's moving away from being really simple
2011-02-06T22:47:06  <jbroman> Well, sure. It's crazy, I said.
2011-02-06T22:47:10  <antimatroid> i quite like having to handle clearly defined io then getting to go to town
2011-02-06T22:47:48  <jmcarthur> to me part of the appeal of this contest is that you can write with whatever language and tools you want
2011-02-06T22:47:56  <jmcarthur> if you have to use a DSL, that's out the window
2011-02-06T22:48:15  <jbroman> jmcarthur: For sure. It has gigantic limitations that put it outside the scope of the contest.
2011-02-06T22:48:29  <jbroman> I was more saying that it's an interesting problem.
2011-02-06T22:48:30  <j3camero> Yeah that was the original ants idea. But I don't know if it's feasible.
2011-02-06T22:48:37  <jmcarthur> that's why i thought of a compromise where a central bot programs other little bots :D
2011-02-06T22:48:49  <antimatroid> j3camero: i have a c++ starter bot once an engine is running with the new io
2011-02-06T22:49:00  <antimatroid> it's as stupid as can be
2011-02-06T22:49:01  <jmcarthur> which in some ways is actually *easier* to code for
2011-02-06T22:49:18  <amstan> zomg, context manager!
2011-02-06T22:49:24  <jmcarthur> since the central bot could just program a bot to do a sequence of commands and then come back for reprogramming
2011-02-06T22:49:35  <jbroman> amstan: Good or bad "zomg"?
2011-02-06T22:49:40  <amstan> jbroman: awesome zomg
2011-02-06T22:49:43  <jmcarthur> of course, more powerful if you're able to avoid needing that
2011-02-06T22:50:00  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/wIDWDbcz   that's the MyBot.cc file
2011-02-06T22:50:48  <antimatroid> as you can see, the strategy could not be much simpler :P
2011-02-06T22:51:09  <jbroman> antimatroid: Sure it could. May I present to you…the "do nothing" bot!
2011-02-06T22:51:53  <jmcarthur> Just say go!
2011-02-06T22:51:54  <antimatroid> jbroman: without doing nothing* :P
2011-02-06T22:52:30  <jmcarthur> while(1){printf("go\n");}
2011-02-06T22:52:52  <jmcarthur> i guess the engine won't be happy if it doesn't also read stdin
2011-02-06T22:52:56  <jbroman> jmcarthur: for(;;){printf("go\n");}
2011-02-06T22:53:05  <jbroman> Haha, mine's shorter.
2011-02-06T22:53:19  <jmcarthur> jbroman: forever(putStrLn"go")
2011-02-06T22:53:27  <jmcarthur> actually...
2011-02-06T22:53:30  <jmcarthur> jbroman: forever$putStrLn"go"
2011-02-06T22:53:32  <jmcarthur> boom
2011-02-06T22:53:42  <antimatroid> python: print "go"
2011-02-06T22:53:49  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: loop it
2011-02-06T22:53:51  <antimatroid> while 1: print "go", not as nice
2011-02-06T22:53:54  <antimatroid> yeah i forgot
2011-02-06T22:53:59  <antimatroid> i don't like python anyway
2011-02-06T22:54:53  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/7yQBe7Xp - state.h
2011-02-06T22:54:53  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/33oHSMez - state.cc
2011-02-06T22:54:56  <jbroman> Ruby: loop{puts"go"}
2011-02-06T22:55:07  <antimatroid> i'll leave timer.h and general.h out, but it's just 5 files
2011-02-06T22:55:25  <jmcarthur> loop{p"go"}
2011-02-06T22:55:29  <jmcarthur> valid ruby
2011-02-06T22:55:36  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Naw, that puts double quotes around the word "go".
2011-02-06T22:55:46  <jmcarthur> oh? i didn't realize that...
2011-02-06T22:55:54  <jmcarthur> doh, it does
2011-02-06T22:55:57  <jbroman> jmcarthur: p is like Python's repr.
2011-02-06T22:56:00  <jmcarthur> i haven't rubied in a long time
2011-02-06T22:56:21  <jmcarthur> and like haskell's print, i imagine
2011-02-06T22:56:33  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Probably. I don't Haskell enough to know.
2011-02-06T22:56:56  <jmcarthur> print = putStrLn . show
2011-02-06T22:57:08  <jbroman> jmcarthur: Yeah, "p" is like that.
2011-02-06T22:58:53  <amstan> antimatroid: what's with the loc.first and loc.second business?
2011-02-06T22:59:02  <jbroman> Bash: yes|sed s/y/go/
2011-02-06T22:59:27  <antimatroid> amstan: i do have a Location object for my bots, but i figured it was easier to minimise that for starter bots, so i just used pairs for locations
2011-02-06T22:59:37  <amstan> antimatroid: but.. first and second?
2011-02-06T22:59:45  <antimatroid> that's how you access pairs
2011-02-06T22:59:59  <amstan> what about rows&cols or x&y?
2011-02-06T23:00:09  <antimatroid> .first is row and .second is col
2011-02-06T23:00:31  <jbroman> amstan: "pair" is a standard type
2011-02-06T23:00:53  <jbroman> Those names are defined on std::pair
2011-02-06T23:01:00  <amstan> oh, i see
2011-02-06T23:01:08  <amstan> so there's no way to change them
2011-02-06T23:01:15  <antimatroid> i could add the location struct back in
2011-02-06T23:01:20  <antimatroid> then you get .row and .col
2011-02-06T23:01:40  <antimatroid> and not pair<int,int> written everywhere
2011-02-06T23:04:37  <amstan> so what does your bot do?
2011-02-06T23:05:18  <amstan> goes in all 4 directions at once?
2011-02-06T23:05:34  <antimatroid> amstan: each ant will move the first open location
2011-02-06T23:05:51  <antimatroid> oh, it's fairly stupid atm too, it will move two friend ants into the same square
2011-02-06T23:05:58  <antimatroid> and wont move into a square of a friendly ant that is moving
2011-02-06T23:06:02  <antimatroid> i can fix that fairly easily
2011-02-06T23:06:05  <amstan> you should have something for detecting the enemy ants as well, i think that should be in the starter pack
2011-02-06T23:06:35  <antimatroid> amstan: i was thinking the tutorial could pretty much walk people through scanning out with a stack to find something interesting to move towards
2011-02-06T23:06:47  <antimatroid> that way people can make a HUGE improvement over the start relatively easily
2011-02-06T23:06:58  <amstan> ok, sure
2011-02-06T23:07:15  <antimatroid> i will fix up to change the state when an ant moves though
2011-02-06T23:08:05  <antimatroid> actually, that's literally like 2 lines, perhaps that could be the first literally given improvement?
2011-02-06T23:11:15  <antimatroid> well, 3 lines once I changed the function to take an int for the direction
2011-02-06T23:14:57  <antimatroid> oh, there's a few bugs in there cause i deleted stuff i shouldn't have :P
2011-02-06T23:15:04  <antimatroid> it does work what i have now though
