2011-11-17T00:14:29  <a1k0n> now that would be an obnoxious free-for-all
2011-11-17T00:14:57  <McLeopold> it's weird how with the symmetry, the map looks bigger than it is
2011-11-17T00:15:20  <a1k0n> how was that generated?
2011-11-17T00:15:54  <McLeopold> magic
2011-11-17T00:16:00  <a1k0n> and it's not really.. symmetrical by the ants point of view
2011-11-17T00:16:01  <McLeopold> and some python code
2011-11-17T00:16:07  <matthewd> McLeopold: That's not symmetric though, is it?
2011-11-17T00:16:19  <janzert> ignore the hills I presume
2011-11-17T00:16:23  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-11-17T00:16:24  <janzert> they are just there for markers
2011-11-17T00:16:28  <a1k0n> ah
2011-11-17T00:16:41  <a1k0n> oh, they're like voronoi points

2011-11-17T00:17:05  <a1k0n> clever
2011-11-17T00:17:15  <a1k0n> that's the offset grid you were talking about

2011-11-17T02:45:00  <bhasker> so been busy was wondering if i should update my bot to play with the new rules
2011-11-17T02:45:10  <bhasker> only change i think will be to add support to defend/attack hills
2011-11-17T02:45:29  <bhasker> how is the kid doing? when was he/she born?
2011-11-17T02:45:30  <lampahalogenowa> Hello, I've got problem with my bot.. He should play game yesterday but he still has "Next Game: 0 players are ahead" in my profile. Can someone help me? Where should I report this ?
2011-11-17T02:45:30  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-11-17T02:45:34  <a1k0n> which is kind of a big change
2011-11-17T02:46:06  <a1k0n> he's doing well.  sleeping now, getting very chubby.  born 10/15
2011-11-17T02:46:13  <bhasker> nice:) how many pounds
2011-11-17T02:46:28  <a1k0n> 7 lbs 8 oz or so.  he's probably over 10 now.
2011-11-17T02:47:13  <bhasker> wow nice
2011-11-17T02:47:30  <bhasker> looks like your bot is doing quite well
2011-11-17T02:47:39  <bhasker> except you seem to have uploaded  a new version
2011-11-17T02:47:43  <a1k0n> yeah, it'll be a week or so before it shows up on the official leaderboards
2011-11-17T02:48:04  <a1k0n> ants.fluxid.pl is the tcp server most people are using these days (there's also tcpants.com)

2011-11-17T02:49:28  <ikaros> you should find it in your profile
2011-11-17T02:49:43  <lampahalogenowa> I've checked this. It is still active
2011-11-17T02:49:59  <lampahalogenowa> O! Status has  changed
2011-11-17T02:50:10  <ikaros> =)

2011-11-17T06:16:28  <mcstar> well, its a c++ + qt app
2011-11-17T06:16:42  <mcstar> its easier to compile it on linux

2011-11-17T06:21:46  <HaraKiri> mcstar someone should compile linux and windows binaries for that. at least i don't have qt installed :x

2011-11-17T06:22:05  <mcstar> HaraKiri: well, would you trust a binary?
2011-11-17T06:22:13  <mcstar> i can compile a linux one for you
2011-11-17T06:22:17  <mcstar> and upload it

2011-11-17T06:22:38  <Anilm3> he needs qt installed
2011-11-17T06:22:45  <Anilm3> even with a binary
2011-11-17T06:22:55  <Anilm3> unless you compile with static libraries
2011-11-17T06:22:59  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-17T06:23:01  <HaraKiri> i'm pretty naive, yes :D. but im on windows right now anyways. also, i'm sure many ppl on the tools forum would appreciate that tool
2011-11-17T06:23:14  <HaraKiri> oh ok
2011-11-17T06:23:17  <mcstar> i dont have windows right now

2011-11-17T06:25:56  <mcstar> its not that big
2011-11-17T06:26:33  <HaraKiri> for a windows binary?
2011-11-17T06:26:50  <Anilm3> oh god this unity thing stucks
2011-11-17T06:26:53  <Anilm3> sucks*

2011-11-17T06:27:38  <Minthos> people should just use fluxbox
2011-11-17T06:27:44  <mcstar> Minthos: really?
2011-11-17T06:27:48  <Minthos> and not worry about the new fancy wms
2011-11-17T06:27:50  <Anilm3> mcstar: I tried it for a while, but is crazy
2011-11-17T06:27:50  <Minthos> yes really
2011-11-17T06:27:52  <NightExcessive> Anilm3: Don't use Ubuntu... or figure out how to use a different desktop environment with Ubuntu. I personally use openSUSE.
2011-11-17T06:27:54  <mcstar> have you tried a good tiling wm?
2011-11-17T06:27:59  <Anilm3> Minthos:  I agree

2011-11-17T06:30:24  <mcstar> to make it self-contained
2011-11-17T06:30:30  <mcstar> but i never did cross compilation before
2011-11-17T06:30:32  <HaraKiri> would be awesome
2011-11-17T06:30:35  <mcstar> so i have to read up

2011-11-17T06:30:54  <HaraKiri> sure, just hit me if you need me
2011-11-17T06:31:02  <mcstar> k thx
2011-11-17T06:31:20  <mcstar> kubuntu was my second longest-used distro
2011-11-17T06:31:33  <mcstar> i could use it for a half year
2011-11-17T06:33:51  <Anilm3> I was using ubuntu 10.04 but it decided to die
2011-11-17T06:33:59  <Anilm3> and I couldn't revive it :(
2011-11-17T06:34:45  <HaraKiri> for me ubuntu and kubuntu became unusable imho. xubuntu works ok
2011-11-17T06:35:01  <NightExcessive> I managed to murder openSUSE a few times by being impatient and killing the package manager in the middle of an update.
2011-11-17T06:35:19  <HaraKiri> fluxbox looks somewhere between fancy and insane
2011-11-17T06:35:46  <Anilm3> I used fluxbox for a while and loved it
2011-11-17T06:36:03  <HaraKiri> why only for a while then? ;p

2011-11-17T06:47:47  <Anilm3> I did
2011-11-17T06:47:58  <NightExcessive> :)
2011-11-17T06:48:10  <pairofdice> Pff, I'm sure Unity is awesome
2011-11-17T06:48:28  <mcstar> weird, before i switched to tiling wm, i experimented with old gnome + dockbarx
2011-11-17T06:48:46  <mcstar> its was graphically pleasing and i could do my job relatively fast
2011-11-17T06:49:02  <mcstar> this was almost a year ago
2011-11-17T06:49:23  <mcstar> but id like to stress the usefulness of a tiling wm, it really frees your mind
2011-11-17T06:49:36  <mcstar> from all those clicks and graphics
2011-11-17T06:49:44  <mcstar> and its FAST
2011-11-17T06:50:39  <NightExcessive> GNOME 3 + X11 is extremely fast on my hardware... and has never gobbled my mind up. :P
2011-11-17T06:50:48  <Anilm3> mcstar: I tried awesome and xmonad and didn't really got that excited...
2011-11-17T06:50:53  <pairofdice> Graphics are GOOD!
2011-11-17T06:51:09  <mcstar> im in the minority
2011-11-17T06:51:12  <mcstar> its ok
2011-11-17T06:51:18  <NightExcessive> We sound like a bunch of internet hippies :)
2011-11-17T06:51:31  <mcstar> no, i used osx, and was all for looks at one time
2011-11-17T06:51:33  <HaraKiri> i should try a tiling wm. the idea sounds logic
2011-11-17T06:51:39  <mcstar> but awesome just changed me
2011-11-17T06:51:50  <pairofdice> Well osx and Apple in general is too much about looks
2011-11-17T06:52:06  <mcstar> i mean i tried a new style every months or so
2011-11-17T06:52:07  <Anilm3> games don't work very good with the unity stuff
2011-11-17T06:52:22  <mcstar> at one point i gave up and went minimalistic
2011-11-17T06:52:25  <mcstar> never came back
2011-11-17T06:52:28  <Minthos> osx has a pretty worthless workspace system
2011-11-17T06:52:29  <mcstar> story ends
2011-11-17T06:52:59  <Anilm3> mcstar: one day I will go back to arch+fluxbox and never come back, but I don't find the time :(
2011-11-17T06:53:32  <pairofdice> I don't feel like experimenting with OS's much when I only have one computer
2011-11-17T06:54:00  <Minthos> I used gentoo + fluxbox earlier, time constraints made me switch to ubuntu + fluxbox, it will take a lot to get me to switch to anything else now :)

2011-11-17T07:11:55  <Anilm3> why are the servers so slow? less than 1 game per minute each
2011-11-17T07:11:56  <NightExcessive> I'm too cool for real post-it notes. I use virtual post-it notes. :)
2011-11-17T07:12:11  <NightExcessive> Anilm3: Because bots are taking longer
2011-11-17T07:12:16  <Anilm3> I prefer real ones
2011-11-17T07:12:29  <g0llum> mcstar, shame your nice qt tool did not compile on win ( stone-age mingw c++) qt 4.5.3
2011-11-17T07:13:10  <mcstar> g0llum: it needs c++0x
2011-11-17T07:13:18  <mcstar> maybe thats the problem
2011-11-17T07:13:19  <HaraKiri> fancy
2011-11-17T07:13:20  <Anilm3> How often do you people upload a bot to the site?
2011-11-17T07:13:23  <g0llum> i know..
2011-11-17T07:13:27  <mcstar> ah k
2011-11-17T07:13:34  <mcstar> g0llum: what is the error?
2011-11-17T07:13:38  <mcstar> id like to know
2011-11-17T07:13:41  <g0llum> mingw does not have it
2011-11-17T07:13:45  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-17T07:13:59  <mcstar> but im sure the latest one does doesnt it?
2011-11-17T07:14:04  <g0llum> unordered_maps..
2011-11-17T07:14:11  <mcstar> i dont want you to try it, but thats the problem right?
2011-11-17T07:14:31  <g0llum> mcstar, again ?
2011-11-17T07:14:32  <mcstar> yeah, i pulled that out of my bot's code
2011-11-17T07:14:47  <mcstar> g0llum: im guessing with the latest mingw id be fine
2011-11-17T07:14:50  <mcstar> wont it?

2011-11-17T07:15:28  <g0llum> let me take a look
2011-11-17T07:16:40  <mcstar> i think i will make the active color button title boldfaced
2011-11-17T07:18:20  <Garf> can't you just replace it with a normal map?
2011-11-17T07:18:30  <Garf> it'll use more memory and be slower, but who cares?
2011-11-17T07:20:17  <mcstar> im using a pos struct as key, its basically a pair
2011-11-17T07:20:46  <mcstar> id need to implemen the "less" operation for them to use them in std::map
2011-11-17T07:21:08  <Anilm3> you can do it pal!
2011-11-17T07:21:24  <mcstar> but you can use the new standard
2011-11-17T07:21:32  <mcstar> so I wont have to change anything :D
2011-11-17T07:21:52  <Anilm3> Usually it's a bad practice assuming the user is who has to take care of the portability
2011-11-17T07:22:48  <mcstar> i think it is portable
2011-11-17T07:22:58  <mcstar> doesnt use any os specific thing
2011-11-17T07:23:17  <Anilm3> how can you consider portable an application that uses an unfinished standard and an unfinished library?
2011-11-17T07:23:18  <mcstar> and in the linux world you distribute sources
2011-11-17T07:23:25  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-17T07:23:34  <mcstar> since when is it unfinished?
2011-11-17T07:23:43  <Anilm3> since when it is finished?
2011-11-17T07:23:51  <mcstar> WHAT is unfinished?
2011-11-17T07:23:59  <Anilm3> c++11
2011-11-17T07:24:01  <mcstar> neither c++11 or qt
2011-11-17T07:24:13  <HaraKiri> wait, ++11 is done, right!?
2011-11-17T07:24:17  <mcstar> of course
2011-11-17T07:24:26  <Anilm3> oh all right, september
2011-11-17T07:24:42  <Anilm3> so you can assume it has been already widely implemented
2011-11-17T07:24:50  <mcstar> no
2011-11-17T07:24:58  <mcstar> but it is widely implemented
2011-11-17T07:25:20  <mcstar> the features i use are available in msvs and gcc and intel too
2011-11-17T07:25:20  <Anilm3> suppose I use ubuntu 8.10 on an old computer
2011-11-17T07:25:31  <mcstar> Anilm3: what is your point?
2011-11-17T07:25:43  <mcstar> you can write whatever software and it will break somewhere
2011-11-17T07:25:48  <Anilm3> if it is not imperative to use new features don't use them
2011-11-17T07:25:59  <mcstar> it is imperative
2011-11-17T07:26:02  <Anilm3> stick to the widely implemented standard
2011-11-17T07:26:05  <jix> Anilm3: suppose I use A/UX on my old apple IIsi
2011-11-17T07:26:06  <mcstar> why? because
2011-11-17T07:26:28  <Anilm3> you can also use boost
2011-11-17T07:26:37  <mcstar> Anilm3: i dont WANT you to use it, but you can, im pleased if you want and can
2011-11-17T07:26:50  <mcstar> but above that i dont care
2011-11-17T07:27:08  <Anilm3> ok then people g0llum won't be able to use your app
2011-11-17T07:27:28  <mcstar> i can live with that
2011-11-17T07:27:38  <mcstar> but i think he needs a newer mingw
2011-11-17T07:27:39  <Anilm3> because it's what you want and not what the user needs
2011-11-17T07:27:53  <g0llum> i can stii fire up a vm and od from ubuntu
2011-11-17T07:28:10  <mcstar> Anilm3: its like asking the user to install python
2011-11-17T07:28:26  <mcstar> why on earth would he do that? just to participate in a contest?
2011-11-17T07:28:40  <mcstar> actually yes, just for that
2011-11-17T07:29:05  <mcstar> do you think the contest's engine should be in native i386 pre .net binary?
2011-11-17T07:29:22  <Anilm3> I'm just arguing about good software engineering practices
2011-11-17T07:29:47  <mcstar> you can

2011-11-17T07:31:15  <mcstar> really?
2011-11-17T07:31:28  <mcstar> the server has gcc which version?
2011-11-17T07:31:32  <mcstar> 4.5.X
2011-11-17T07:31:49  <mcstar> it must have been added in the 4.5 branch
2011-11-17T07:32:06  <mcstar> because my code compiles on the server
2011-11-17T07:32:09  <g0llum> mingw versions != usual gcc version
2011-11-17T07:32:16  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-17T07:32:30  <g0llum> and they're always some behind
2011-11-17T07:34:01  <mcstar> g0llum: but is that the latest version? 4.5.2?
2011-11-17T07:34:02  <g0llum> those qt ppl invented their own rtt and containers, so they don't feel the nned to adopt toc++10 so much

2011-11-17T08:01:33  <elderwolf> In my academic bots I don't allow such things as shared memory between ants unless there is a communications channel.  All knowing does not benefit research.

As far as having a nice simulation with randomness and seeds built in with a community behind it, it suits my needs just fine.

2011-11-17T08:15:42  <digger3> mcstar: lol, it probably is :)
2011-11-17T08:16:36  <digger3> retybok: most bots that I've seen perform some for of Kami-kaze when finding an enemy ant hill
2011-11-17T08:16:48  <Minthos> retybok: my decision making is pretty much along the lines of: attack it
2011-11-17T08:17:14  <Minthos> of course the individual ants try not to suicide too blatantly when they get close
2011-11-17T08:17:15  <g0llum> mcstar, there's a rule for c.o, and one for C.o, and win is not case sensitive, i just removed it
2011-11-17T08:17:16  <elderwolf> digger3: Bah.  I wanted to create a stastical human-like chat bot that would maintain a statistical emotion matrix.  Sometimes input would evoke illogical responses.
2011-11-17T08:17:28  <digger3> elderwolf: good luck with that :)
2011-11-17T08:17:40  <retybok> digger3: Minthos that's what I do as well, but it's not always the best decision :)
2011-11-17T08:17:50  <mcstar> g0llum: i see, does it work now
2011-11-17T08:18:15  <retybok> I'm sure there are some good algorithms for that problem, but I don't know any :-/
2011-11-17T08:18:26  <digger3> retybok: agreed, you and the poor lad who you're attacking usually end up > 3rd in larger matches, it's basically suicide while getting points for razing 1 hill
2011-11-17T08:18:34  <elderwolf> digger3: yah, that was canned due to too many people doing AI with emotions and the need for a huge group to determine what was true emotional responses and opinion and such.
2011-11-17T08:18:43  <retybok> digger3: exactly
2011-11-17T08:18:49  <elderwolf> Damn philosophy.
2011-11-17T08:18:55  <retybok> plus it's not very nice for the poor lad in question :)
2011-11-17T08:18:56  <g0llum> nope, it boils down to undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_sj0' when linging libqtmain.a
2011-11-17T08:19:19  <digger3> retybok: agreed, I should rephrase that.... s/lad/ENEMY TERRORST!!!!!/
2011-11-17T08:19:56  <g0llum> i bet it works, if irecompie qt, but i won't ;)
2011-11-17T08:20:05  <mcstar> ok
2011-11-17T08:20:15  <mcstar> thx
2011-11-17T08:20:16  <pairofdice> Enemy CombatAnt
2011-11-17T08:20:34  <mcstar> ill ask if somebody else has qt + gcc on windows
2011-11-17T08:20:51  <digger3> retybok: triggering a suicide run when you've got some percentage of map controll makes sense. Given the relation between map control, food gathering ability and number of ants
2011-11-17T08:20:56  <mcstar> guys does anybody else have qt + mingw or something on windows?
2011-11-17T08:21:08  <digger3> pairofdice: nice1 :)
2011-11-17T08:21:10  <antimatroid> nope :p
2011-11-17T08:21:33  <antimatroid> mcstar: i might start writing a bot tonight
2011-11-17T08:21:43  <retybok> digger3: exactly, but your limited knowledge of ennemy players makes it a lot harder
2011-11-17T08:21:45  <mcstar> antimatroid: hey
2011-11-17T08:21:48  <mcstar> you back?
2011-11-17T08:21:50  <antimatroid> my ride got cut short, rack broke :(

2011-11-17T08:22:01  <antimatroid> good, we managed over 200km in the end
2011-11-17T08:22:14  <mcstar> thats 1 day right?
2011-11-17T08:22:17  <antimatroid> 4
2011-11-17T08:22:25  <antimatroid> we had lots of weight on the back of the bikes and LOTS of up hill
2011-11-17T08:22:25  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-17T08:22:30  <mcstar> ah ok
2011-11-17T08:22:49  <digger3> retybok: calculating the % of map control is relatively easy though
2011-11-17T08:23:02  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you have qt?
2011-11-17T08:23:03  <digger3> retybok: assuming decent exploration capabilities
2011-11-17T08:23:07  <antimatroid> mcstar: nope
2011-11-17T08:23:18  <mcstar> sure? are you all gtk?
2011-11-17T08:23:26  <antimatroid> our tron state evaluation function depended on map control
2011-11-17T08:23:30  <antimatroid> it's very easy to calculate
2011-11-17T08:23:45  <antimatroid> qt is what people use to make guis from what i know?
2011-11-17T08:23:54  <antimatroid> i don't think i've ever used it other than quickly installing it
2011-11-17T08:23:55  <mcstar> yes, but you probably have it
2011-11-17T08:24:08  <retybok> digger3: yeah, that's pretty easy, but it doesn't protect you against one guy piling up a huge army in an unexplored corner of the map
2011-11-17T08:24:12  <antimatroid> i also use ubuntu these days? i have no idea about these things :P
2011-11-17T08:24:15  <Zao> mcstar: I've built Qt with gcc on Windows. It's great fun.
2011-11-17T08:24:26  <Zao> Whatever you do, make sure you're using configure.exe and not ./configure.
2011-11-17T08:24:41  <Zao> The latter is only for Real Operating Systems.
2011-11-17T08:24:46  <mcstar> Zao: do you have that environment still?
2011-11-17T08:24:51  <retybok> antimatroid: qt is used to make Guis, but also includes other functionalities
2011-11-17T08:25:01  <digger3> retybok: right, so any unexplored part is full with enemy ants of opponent X with some probability P
2011-11-17T08:25:02  <Zao> mcstar: It's not really usable, it's 64-bit Qt 4.8.0
2011-11-17T08:25:17  <Zao> mcstar: A garden variety install of TDM-gcc ought to do the trick.
2011-11-17T08:25:29  <mcstar> Zao: could you try to compile my source?
2011-11-17T08:25:39  <Zao> mcstar: I'm at work, sadly.

2011-11-17T08:28:45  <retybok> suppose there are five players on the map, with roughly equal forces. Do you attack your neighbor?
2011-11-17T08:30:19  <Minthos> ideally you would attack whomever is getting attacked by someone else
2011-11-17T08:30:25  <Minthos> good luck figuring that out

2011-11-17T08:32:23  <Minthos> or actually the best target is the player attacking someone else, not the player getting attacked

2011-11-17T08:32:54  <mcstar> the best target is the target with the lowest degrees of freedom

2011-11-17T11:25:23  <ikaros> anyone knows if theres a way to download maps from fluxid? the links are only html files
2011-11-17T11:25:57  <grwip> I made a perl script to import them, can send it to you if you want, pretty straight forward
2011-11-17T11:26:20  <ikaros> sure that would be nice pastebin or email?
2011-11-17T11:26:44  <grwip> never used pastebin, sounds like a nice occasion to start
2011-11-17T11:27:03  <ikaros> just paste it @ pastebin.com :)
2011-11-17T11:27:42  <Fluxid> ikaros: those maps are in aichallenge repo
2011-11-17T11:27:50  <Fluxid> and to download on aichallenge.org
2011-11-17T11:28:01  <grwip> so no need for the script then...
2011-11-17T11:28:05  <ikaros> hm
2011-11-17T11:28:14  <ikaros> on aichallenge.org i didnt find them
2011-11-17T11:28:16  <grwip> I should have asked here before writing it
2011-11-17T11:28:27  <pairofdice> http://aichallenge.org/maps.php
2011-11-17T11:28:34  <Fluxid> http://aichallenge.org/maps.php
2011-11-17T11:28:36  <Fluxid> yup
2011-11-17T11:28:39  <ikaros> well
2011-11-17T11:28:43  <grwip> anyway, it had been a long time since I touched perl so it was good practice ;)
2011-11-17T11:28:58  <Fluxid> but, if you have aichallenge repo cloned locally
2011-11-17T11:28:58  <ikaros> theres no mmaze_02p_01.map e.g.
2011-11-17T11:29:02  <ikaros> i have
2011-11-17T11:29:05  <Fluxid> you have those maps in maps directory ;P
2011-11-17T11:29:42  <ikaros> no :/
2011-11-17T11:29:54  <ikaros> tools/maps right?
2011-11-17T11:30:00  <Fluxid> mmaze are from multimaze directory
2011-11-17T11:30:07  <ikaros> ok so just names are different?
2011-11-17T11:30:23  <Fluxid> yeah, because there are to directories with same-name map files
2011-11-17T11:30:42  <ikaros> hm ill check out which map this should be..
2011-11-17T11:30:43  <Fluxid> but on tcp those are put in one directory, so from multi have just added one letter
2011-11-17T11:30:54  <ikaros> strange that its multi hill because it isnt
2011-11-17T11:30:58  <ikaros> very irritating
2011-11-17T11:31:16  <Fluxid> i mean, mmaze are from  multi_hill_maze directory
2011-11-17T11:31:41  <ikaros> yea i understand
2011-11-17T11:31:49  <ikaros> but http://ants.fluxid.pl/map/mmaze_02p_01.map
2011-11-17T11:31:50  <Fluxid> ikaros: then maybe it't other way arouns ;)
2011-11-17T11:31:54  <ikaros> where is that multi hill?
2011-11-17T11:31:55  <ikaros> lol
2011-11-17T11:32:03  <pairofdice> heh

2011-11-17T11:33:54  <ikaros> guess ill have to try a git pull on the aichallenge thingy
2011-11-17T11:34:00  <grwip> ok maybe this will be faster after all
2011-11-17T11:34:01  <grwip> http://pastebin.com/yqUxA0ui
2011-11-17T11:34:21  <grwip> I hope there isn't any perl purist around
2011-11-17T11:34:27  <grwip> I guess it's poorly written
2011-11-17T11:34:48  <Fluxid> yeah, many times just writing a script is faster than looking for real solution, i agree ;)
2011-11-17T11:35:13  <grwip> and it help to keep practicing ;)
2011-11-17T11:35:15  <Fluxid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/maps/multi_hill_maze
2011-11-17T11:35:20  <mcstar> you ugly scripters

2011-11-17T11:36:13  <ikaros> wow fluxid thx i have a whole different directory structur
2011-11-17T11:36:19  <ikaros> guess ill just clone this again
2011-11-17T11:36:23  <Fluxid> ikaros: no, just pull
2011-11-17T11:36:32  <ikaros> theres something wrong :)
2011-11-17T11:36:33  <Fluxid> there were many changes in repo sooooo
2011-11-17T11:36:36  <ikaros> with my git repo
2011-11-17T11:36:38  <Fluxid> you should pull frequently
2011-11-17T11:36:43  <ikaros> yea
2011-11-17T11:36:43  <Fluxid> ah
2011-11-17T11:37:03  <ikaros> i need to fork it anyways for submitting a pull request soon
2011-11-17T11:37:13  <ikaros> so theres finally a reason to do it :)

2011-11-17T12:34:32  <mcstar> no
2011-11-17T12:34:56  <amstan> the only logical guarantee that you should have is that you have at least 1 ant and at least 1 hill
2011-11-17T12:35:15  <amstan> if it's on the hill or not i don't think it matters
2011-11-17T12:35:21  <mcstar> the always on the hill is probably very true

2011-11-17T12:35:37  <mcstar> whats that?
2011-11-17T12:35:39  <Yexo> but if none of your ants see your hill you don't get the location

2011-11-17T12:36:20  <lorill> argh. So I can't assume that my ant locations at first turn is the same as my hill locations ?

2011-11-17T12:38:30  <amstan> that would be cool actually
2011-11-17T12:38:32  <ikaros> there arent scenarios played in the contest arent they
2011-11-17T12:38:37  <amstan> have a game where you have to find your hill first
2011-11-17T12:38:54  <bqf> ikaros: nothing in the rules or the specs says that that cannot change though ;)

2011-11-17T12:39:08  <lorill> @amstan: the starter kit only tells me there's an ant there

2011-11-17T12:39:28  <elderwolf> Arggg.  I'm winning my matches, but I'm timing out despite my failsafes.
2011-11-17T12:39:35  <lorill> the alternative java one I guess
2011-11-17T12:39:43  <lorill> but I can change it, so it doesn't matter
2011-11-17T12:39:54  <amstan> if you have hill support you should already know where your hill is, if you see it
2011-11-17T12:39:57  <lorill> so on the first turn, I get ants + hills, even if ants are on my hills ?
2011-11-17T12:40:16  <amstan> what if you start with 3 ants? do you assume you have 3 hills?
2011-11-17T12:40:17  <lorill> the point being, if the ant is on it, I don't see it (at least that was my understanding)

2011-11-17T12:40:26  <lorill> for the moment, yes
2011-11-17T12:40:30  <amstan> if the ant is on it, it's a capital letter
2011-11-17T12:40:31  <lorill> that's why I wanted to be sure
2011-11-17T12:40:34  <amstan> read the map specs
2011-11-17T12:40:52  <amstan> if you're player 1
2011-11-17T12:40:57  <amstan> 0 is your hill without an ant on it
2011-11-17T12:41:00  <amstan> a is a normal ant
2011-11-17T12:41:10  <amstan> A is an ant on top of a hill you have

2011-11-17T12:42:21  <lorill> this shuld be in the "Turn Information:" section I guess, but ok
2011-11-17T12:42:31  <amstan> turn information is another matter
2011-11-17T12:42:41  <lorill> I'm lost then
2011-11-17T12:43:07  <lorill> If I don't get the info at setup neither at turn info, when do I get it ?
2011-11-17T12:43:34  <amstan> oh, i see how this is done
2011-11-17T12:43:37  <mcstar> you mean different things by turn info
2011-11-17T12:43:39  <amstan> you don't get the map at all
2011-11-17T12:43:43  <lorill> I know
2011-11-17T12:43:58  <amstan> lorill: if you have an ant and a hill on the same spot, and assuming you don't see any water or food in first turn
2011-11-17T12:44:02  <amstan> what you'll get is

2011-11-17T12:45:04  <amstan> you always get sent what you see
2011-11-17T12:45:35  <mcstar> except water
2011-11-17T12:45:36  <lorill> and do I always see my hill if one of my ant is on it ?

2011-11-17T12:48:07  <g0llum> yea back, connection problems
2011-11-17T12:48:22  <mcstar> can you check something for me?
2011-11-17T12:48:24  <lorill> the fact that I can't see enemy hills if ants are on the same tile
2011-11-17T12:48:28  <g0llum> i'll try
2011-11-17T12:48:30  <mcstar> --enable-sjlj-exceptions
2011-11-17T12:48:36  <mcstar> try adding this to the flags
2011-11-17T12:48:39  <lorill> so I guessed the same would be true for mine
2011-11-17T12:48:45  <g0llum> linker ?
2011-11-17T12:48:53  <mcstar> no compile
2011-11-17T12:48:59  <mcstar> no, compile
2011-11-17T12:49:12  <amstan> lorill: if your ants are on their hills, you def can't see them, becasue the hills won't exist anymore
2011-11-17T12:49:34  <lorill> man, so many misunderstandings
2011-11-17T12:49:35  <mcstar> mingw and your qt is compiled differently
2011-11-17T12:49:40  <lorill> that was not at all what I meant
2011-11-17T12:50:25  <lorill> if an enemy ant is on his own hill, and this tile is in my view, do I see ant + hill or only ant ?
2011-11-17T12:50:53  <mcstar> both

2011-11-17T12:53:26  <lorill> yeah sure, if we can always see hills even if an ant is on it :)
2011-11-17T12:53:33  <lorill> that changes a lot of my plans
2011-11-17T12:53:48  <lorill> I'll check if my bot can actually use this info

2011-11-17T12:53:59  <lorill> and i'll remove my tentative to hide my hills
2011-11-17T12:54:02  <mcstar> so i guess maybe you need the opposite?
2011-11-17T12:54:06  <mcstar> try disabling it?
2011-11-17T12:54:13  <lorill> heh, that's why I checked it here first :)

2011-11-17T13:09:06  <thestinger> pacman v4 has package signing and over 60% of packages in the repos are already signed
2011-11-17T13:10:04  <mcstar>  ['ikaros_bot_v8/Release/ikaros_bot']
2011-11-17T13:10:13  <mcstar> ikaros: why is that in [] brackets?
2011-11-17T13:10:16  <Anilm3> thestinger: thanks great news!!
2011-11-17T13:10:34  <ikaros> i have no idea
2011-11-17T13:10:45  <mcstar> may not be the problem, but i remember an error like that and i think it shuoldnt be in brackets
2011-11-17T13:10:48  <ikaros> is that python list stuff?
2011-11-17T13:10:59  <mcstar> but it shouldnt be a list

2011-11-17T13:11:16  <mcstar> shell command hsould be a string
2011-11-17T13:11:19  <ikaros> i just pass it as "ikaros_bot_v8/Release/ikaros_bot"
2011-11-17T13:11:26  <mcstar> tthat is inlined directly to {0}
2011-11-17T13:11:28  <ikaros> to playgame.py such as the other bot .. which works
2011-11-17T13:11:42  <thestinger> Anilm3: the new pacman is still in the [testing] repository, but mostly only because they haven't made a keyring package yet (pacman retrieves the keys from a keyserver when you install, and asks you to trust them - but you can manually download them using the signatures on the site instead)
2011-11-17T13:11:46  <mcstar> ok, im just guessing here
2011-11-17T13:11:56  <ikaros> very strange issue
2011-11-17T13:12:05  <mcstar> thestinger: but you dont use it right?
2011-11-17T13:12:29  <thestinger> I use Arch and I use [testing] :P
2011-11-17T13:12:35  <mcstar> i know
2011-11-17T13:12:40  <mcstar> but you dont use pacman v4
2011-11-17T13:12:42  <Anilm3> I'll have to take a look
2011-11-17T13:12:52  <mcstar> or do you?
2011-11-17T13:12:54  <thestinger> mcstar: I do
2011-11-17T13:13:04  <mcstar> so what is th ebenefit?
2011-11-17T13:13:19  <mcstar> was there any incident that somebody made a malicious package?
2011-11-17T13:13:25  <thestinger> well, there are many improvements on the version in [extra], package signing is just one
2011-11-17T13:13:51  <thestinger> mcstar: kernel.org was hacked, and that's one of the Arch mirrors - someone could have tampered with packages
2011-11-17T13:13:58  <thestinger> there was no way to know if someone was doing stuff before
2011-11-17T13:14:05  <mcstar> when?

2011-11-17T13:14:47  <thestinger> well, that's a bad article (was just the first one on google news)
2011-11-17T13:15:17  <mcstar> theres a link in it
2011-11-17T13:15:21  <mcstar> so in august?
2011-11-17T13:15:26  <mcstar> bad news
2011-11-17T13:16:20  <thestinger> the git repositories are safe, b/c they are basically signed even if you aren't using gpg
2011-11-17T13:16:29  <thestinger> each commit has a hash based on every previous commit
2011-11-17T13:16:50  <thestinger> and there are lots of mirrors (every dev has at least one, yay DVCS)
2011-11-17T13:16:51  <mcstar> arch's weakness is aur
2011-11-17T13:17:00  <mcstar> you can easily make a malicious pkgbuild
2011-11-17T13:17:18  <mcstar> it would be pretty obvious i think
2011-11-17T13:17:32  <mcstar> i remember i read something in the forums that it happened once
2011-11-17T13:18:06  <thestinger> https://projects.archlinux.org/pacman.git/tree/NEWS there's the changelog, lots of new stuff in v4

2011-11-17T13:44:40  <Yexo> mcstar: turn time is 5 seconds, but your bot also gets 5000 ms as maximum turn time
2011-11-17T13:44:52  <mcstar> Yexo: but our bots finish very soon
2011-11-17T13:44:54  <Yexo> so if it uses say 4990 ms there is only 10ms available for network overhead
2011-11-17T13:45:01  <thestinger> mcstar: it definitely leaks threads sometimes
2011-11-17T13:45:10  <thestinger> well, maybe just sockets
2011-11-17T13:45:23  <thestinger> I've been checking with 'lsof -i'
2011-11-17T13:45:49  <thestinger> it sometimes leaks sockets, and for each one I think it also leaves a thread running and an instance of the bot
2011-11-17T13:45:52  <thestinger> >.<
2011-11-17T13:46:41  <mcstar> oh? bad script, go to your room
2011-11-17T13:46:57  <ikaros> mcstar, ./ didnt work but full path does it
2011-11-17T13:47:03  <ikaros> no idea why but thx
2011-11-17T13:47:04  <ikaros> =)
2011-11-17T13:47:06  <mcstar> ikaros: weird
2011-11-17T13:47:09  <ikaros> yea

2011-11-17T13:47:32  <mcstar> there was a similar error couple of days ago, didnt work with relative paths
2011-11-17T13:47:44  <mcstar> the engine is still broken in this regard
2011-11-17T13:47:48  <thestinger> Yexo: food can block your moves
2011-11-17T13:47:55  <Yexo> thestinger: it's not that
2011-11-17T13:48:08  <Yexo> I've checked the logs. there is no food spawn, the tile is free
2011-11-17T13:48:52  <ikaros> well now that it works.. time to go productive again..

2011-11-17T13:50:18  <ikaros> amstan, thx for merging .. is the lib already available on the server?
2011-11-17T13:51:26  <amstan> ikaros: i'm not sure, janzert knows
2011-11-17T13:51:31  <Yexo> are people actually storing the state of their ants and comparing their state with what they get as input?
2011-11-17T13:51:41  <amstan> they might not be unless the workers restart
2011-11-17T13:51:49  <thestinger> Yexo: nope
2011-11-17T13:52:23  <mcstar> Yexo: yep
2011-11-17T13:52:54  <amstan> ikaros: there seems to be a bunch of workers booting right now
2011-11-17T13:52:56  <mcstar> of course i will not have assert's in my code
2011-11-17T13:53:07  <mcstar> lol, imagine you leave it there at the end of the contest
2011-11-17T13:53:13  <Yexo> I can easily disable that assert (my bot doesn't depend on it)
2011-11-17T13:53:17  <mcstar> and you dont win because your assert fails
2011-11-17T13:53:30  <Yexo> but currently it indicates either a bug in my bot or in the engine
2011-11-17T13:53:30  <mcstar> of cours,e but people make mistakes
2011-11-17T13:53:42  <goldcaddy77> Yexo: yup
2011-11-17T13:53:54  <Yexo> and I've checked the input/ouput, which leads me (however unlikely) to believe it's a bug in the engine
2011-11-17T13:54:08  <Yexo> but then I'd expect that other people would've hit it already
2011-11-17T13:54:14  <mcstar> its not impossible just unllikely
2011-11-17T13:54:18  <mcstar> im checking it btw
2011-11-17T13:54:25  <ikaros> amstan, ok so when i upload my next version it will probably work :) thx
2011-11-17T13:54:28  <Yexo> ok, thanks :)
2011-11-17T13:55:05  <janzert> yeah, the workers are updating now
2011-11-17T13:55:24  <goldcaddy77> Yexo: if you compare the dead ant feedback you get as input with code that tracks all ants and removes - is it consistent?
2011-11-17T13:55:44  <janzert> amstan: the worker list from worker_ssh includes a lot of machines that aren't actually workers
2011-11-17T13:55:50  <amstan> janzert: i was just about to say that
2011-11-17T13:56:03  <Yexo> goldcaddy77: I don't track the daed ant input. for every ant in my input I check that it's either on a tile an ant moved to last turn or on a hill
2011-11-17T13:56:06  <amstan> janzert: but there's no way of knowing, i would do the same thing manually
2011-11-17T13:56:07  <janzert> I can't think of an easy way to fix it though
2011-11-17T13:56:16  <amstan> janzert: unless we get a last_seen time in the db
2011-11-17T13:56:19  <Yexo> than I throw away all ants I didn't get in the input
2011-11-17T13:56:50  <ikaros> well in some days they all should have the lib installed right? that would be enough ;)
2011-11-17T13:56:50  <janzert> really the only way to tell for sure would be to try logging in
2011-11-17T13:56:59  <amstan> janzert: want me to try that?
2011-11-17T13:57:57  <janzert> that's pretty heavy handed
2011-11-17T13:58:02  <thestinger> ah, I found a weird bug that causes an infinite loop :)
2011-11-17T13:58:12  <bugnuts2> was it an ant?
2011-11-17T13:58:23  <thestinger> xD
2011-11-17T13:58:30  <thestinger> yes actually
2011-11-17T13:59:01  <goldcaddy77> Yexo: gotcha... i mean that's fine, but sometimes you want to do something when an ant dies, too
2011-11-17T13:59:07  <goldcaddy77> that's why you'd want to keep track
2011-11-17T13:59:16  <thestinger> if an enemy ant spawns in a hill and I have only 1 ant next to that hill and there is no way for that ant to survive, a loop never ends :P
2011-11-17T13:59:39  <Yexo> goldcaddy77: I might do that when I need it. For now I don't need the state from the previous turn at all, but I still want to know why it isn't consistent
2011-11-17T13:59:50  <amstan> janzert: hmm?
2011-11-17T14:00:31  <mcstar> Yexo: your log is weird, turn 152 info in intertwined with turn 153 info

2011-11-17T14:00:55  <mcstar> are you sure, the engine actually received that command?
2011-11-17T14:01:05  <amstan> janzert: what was heavy handed?
2011-11-17T14:01:19  <janzert> attempting an ssh login just to create a list of active servers
2011-11-17T14:01:27  <Yexo> mcstar: the command "o 65 77 N" is between two other commands that were executed
2011-11-17T14:01:39  <amstan> i'm already doing almost that, with a tcp connection on port 22
2011-11-17T14:01:40  <mcstar> Yexo: how about a stream output? i think that catches everything the engine recieves
2011-11-17T14:01:44  <Yexo> the game was played on a tcp server, so I cannot be entirely sure what happened
2011-11-17T14:02:04  <mcstar> Yexo: but you log that, not the engine
2011-11-17T14:02:16  <mcstar> that log is from your bot right?
2011-11-17T14:02:17  <Yexo> http://paste.aichallenge.org/CoKNs/raw/ This was logged by me
2011-11-17T14:02:18  <Yexo> yes
2011-11-17T14:02:25  <mcstar> that isnt necessarily what the engine seen of that
2011-11-17T14:02:29  <Yexo> I write every line I read/write to input.txt / output.txt
2011-11-17T14:02:29  <amstan> janzert: how about we apply that only to the active ssh list, as another filter?
2011-11-17T14:02:42  <mcstar> Yexo: so the problem i think is that that line got lost
2011-11-17T14:02:43  <amstan> well, nvm, that would be the same thing
2011-11-17T14:02:48  <mcstar> and the engine is in fact correct
2011-11-17T14:03:03  <janzert> the tcp connection is quite a small part of the full ssh setup
2011-11-17T14:03:07  <Yexo> mcstar: that's possible. Is there someway to replay a game given the html replay?
2011-11-17T14:03:14  <janzert> but I also don't have a better solution
2011-11-17T14:03:53  <amstan> janzert: do we care too much? I could pass ssh some flags to just stop sshing if there's a password
2011-11-17T14:04:00  <amstan> janzert: when you try to login
2011-11-17T14:04:08  <amstan> that way it's easier for -a
2011-11-17T14:04:22  <janzert> btw, I didn't look too closely at the code but I think it is checking the 20 highest worker ids?
2011-11-17T14:04:25  <McLeopold> just check the logs for workers phoning home
2011-11-17T14:04:26  <mcstar> Yexo: you can get your input from the visualizer
2011-11-17T14:04:29  <amstan> janzert: it is
2011-11-17T14:04:31  <mcstar> theres a button called bot-in
2011-11-17T14:04:39  <Yexo> mcstar: yes, I've checked that input
2011-11-17T14:04:45  <janzert> amstan: it should check the workers with the most recent activity
2011-11-17T14:04:45  <Yexo> that input is consistent with my own logged input
2011-11-17T14:04:46  <mcstar> but thats not enough i think
2011-11-17T14:04:58  <janzert> for instance we've had worker 13 come back several times
2011-11-17T14:05:01  <amstan> janzert: but unless i check the logs, i can't know that
2011-11-17T14:05:04  <Yexo> what I would actually need is my own output (I have my own log of that, but not what the server received)
2011-11-17T14:05:13  <janzert> query by recent games
2011-11-17T14:05:16  <mcstar> Yexo: yeah i know, but i think that is not possible
2011-11-17T14:05:28  <amstan> hmm, that could work
2011-11-17T14:05:33  <amstan> ok
2011-11-17T14:05:36  <amstan> i'll work on that today
2011-11-17T14:05:38  <janzert> or rather sort your query by max game id
2011-11-17T14:05:50  <McLeopold> just use the server_stats query with a different time frame if needed
2011-11-17T14:06:08  <Yexo> mcstar: I could in theory recreate it from the html, but that would mean I get the version with that move not executed,and I still wouldn't know if the engine received it
2011-11-17T14:06:24  <amstan> McLeopold: ideally we should get workers that haven't played games yet in there too
2011-11-17T14:06:28  <janzert> hmm, except it should include workers that don't have a game yet
2011-11-17T14:06:32  <mcstar> Yexo: but you could try looking at the json file, that is in the html too, but it would be the same as watching the replay
2011-11-17T14:06:35  <janzert> right :)
2011-11-17T14:06:37  <amstan> McLeopold: like workers that just phoned in for the install
2011-11-17T14:06:45  <mcstar> yes eaxctl
2011-11-17T14:06:45  <amstan> i think it would be best to try the ssh stuff
2011-11-17T14:06:55  <amstan> i don't think it'll be that much of a problem
2011-11-17T14:07:29  <amstan> we're already tcping to port 22, ssh will act the same way when it fails, except it'll be better when it makes a connection
2011-11-17T14:07:31  <janzert> one thing with the ssh stuff if you don't have it do a full login it doesn't really tell you if it's a worker does it?
2011-11-17T14:07:51  <McLeopold> amstan: you could setup a ping for each server that calls the setup
2011-11-17T14:08:04  <amstan> McLeopold: i already have that, problem is we're getting false positives
2011-11-17T14:08:08  <McLeopold> oh
2011-11-17T14:08:28  <McLeopold> so, we would need our own program to respond to pings

2011-11-17T14:26:40  <thestinger> I don't think you can actually have a non-thread safe object in CPython due to the GIL

2011-11-17T14:28:51  <Yexo> basically an order of my bot was not executed by the engine
2011-11-17T14:28:59  <Yexo> without a valid reason not to execute it

2011-11-17T14:29:26  <Yexo> so far I've determined that my bot did output the mvoe and that tcpclient.py send it to the server

2011-11-17T14:29:40  <Surya> G0llum,  Thank you for your attention. I tried to specify the port (I launched the tcpServer on port 2081) so I tried 2081 (and then 2080 as you said). My game is played well, but then I have the "ERROR - php - writing ranks : [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified (which is ants_skills.php and located at the correct spot)
2011-11-17T14:29:42  <Garf> same here. my bots now have stable ratings
2011-11-17T14:29:51  <Fluxid> Yexo: can you give me an example?
2011-11-17T14:29:55  <Fluxid> in replay?
2011-11-17T14:29:58  <Yexo> http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1627
2011-11-17T14:30:03  <Yexo> turn 152 / 153
2011-11-17T14:30:21  <Yexo> both on 65 77 was ordered N in turn 152 but didn't move
2011-11-17T14:30:39  <magiik> both?
2011-11-17T14:31:44  <Fluxid> Yexo: no idea, all you can get is json replay and bot input from "BOT IN" button
2011-11-17T14:32:03  <Yexo> yes, I got that already. Thanks though
2011-11-17T14:33:15  <McLeopold> Yexo: I assume you logged the next input showing the ant didn't move from 65 77?
2011-11-17T14:33:29  <Yexo> McLeopold: yes
2011-11-17T14:33:38  <McLeopold> oh, I see it now
2011-11-17T14:33:40  <magiik> Yexo: prolly better off trying to replicate it with playgame.py and seeds
2011-11-17T14:33:55  <mcstar> be wont be able to locally
2011-11-17T14:33:57  <Yexo> magiik: that's hard when you don't have the other bots that played
2011-11-17T14:34:09  <magiik> i meant try to reproduce it w/o those bots
2011-11-17T14:34:14  <McLeopold> Yexo: you have the other bots' input
2011-11-17T14:34:16  <magiik> well - you could play the replay
2011-11-17T14:34:19  <magiik> back to your bot
2011-11-17T14:34:24  <Surya> Anyone who could help with the TcpServer/Webserver.py? I got my games done but I got an error on "ERROR - php - writing ranks : [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified (which is ants_skills.php and located at the correct spot). Isn't it supposed to generate a cute website and everything? I can't find it
2011-11-17T14:34:28  <magiik> and use the same seed as the game
2011-11-17T14:34:29  <Yexo> McLeopold: yes, I can get that from the replay
2011-11-17T14:34:58  <Yexo> if there are no more ideas I could extract all the moves done by the other bots from the replay and write a "bot" that executes those moves
2011-11-17T14:35:11  <g0llum> Surya, it can't find php
2011-11-17T14:35:17  <magiik> or just write a psuedo playgame
2011-11-17T14:35:23  <magiik> that plays your ant's replay back to it
2011-11-17T14:35:29  <McLeopold> Yexo: if you don't see this issue on official, and you don't see it often on tcp, I would ignore it and work on more productive things
2011-11-17T14:35:33  <magiik> all you need is for your bot to make the moves - all the other ant positions that your bot will see
2011-11-17T14:35:36  <magiik> is contained in your bots replay
2011-11-17T14:35:45  <Yexo> magiik: I know, that's trivial
2011-11-17T14:35:57  <Yexo> I can reproduce the problem, but the ant won't magically move
2011-11-17T14:36:09  <magiik> then you would have to debug the engine
2011-11-17T14:36:15  <magiik> if you can reproduce it in playgame.py
2011-11-17T14:36:26  <Yexo> McLeopold: I see it about 1 in 10 games on tcp
2011-11-17T14:36:44  <Yexo> bot is not playing on official yet because we're with a group and haven't yet created an account
2011-11-17T14:36:51  <McLeopold> as long as the engine isn't making the mistake...
2011-11-17T14:37:00  <Yexo> my bot certainly isn't
2011-11-17T14:37:05  <Yexo> to it's either in the tcp server or in the engine
2011-11-17T14:37:35  <McLeopold> which tcp server?
2011-11-17T14:37:39  <Yexo> the tcp server is quite simple, so I'm more and more strongly suspecting the engine
2011-11-17T14:37:42  <Yexo> https://github.com/berak/ants-tcp/blob/master/tcpserver.py
2011-11-17T14:37:44  <magiik> and thats why i say replicate it in playgame.py
2011-11-17T14:38:06  <McLeopold> not the code, the server :)
2011-11-17T14:38:08  <Yexo> magiik: and how would I go about doing that? playgame.py needs more than my own bot
2011-11-17T14:38:14  <Yexo> running http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.1627
2011-11-17T14:38:16  <magiik> any idea how long into your turn it happened?
2011-11-17T14:38:20  <Garf> well, run with test bots
2011-11-17T14:38:26  <magiik> could it be that issue with the engine reading input in 50ms blocks or something
2011-11-17T14:38:42  <McLeopold> Fluxid: can you log bot inputs and outputs until Yexo gets another assert?
2011-11-17T14:39:06  <magiik> Yexo: i do have the code for one of those bots m3 heh
2011-11-17T14:39:12  <magiik> but that doesn't help with replicating the other bots
2011-11-17T14:40:01  <magiik> my diffusion map bot's emergent behavior seems to be sneak attack the hive
2011-11-17T14:40:04  <Surya> g0llum, I added the php.exe folder in the PATH and I still got the error. Are you sure it's because of the php.exe and not the file itself?
2011-11-17T14:40:51  <magiik> because i havn't implemented proper combat - just a sort of kludged together diffusion map based thing with enemy ants vs my ants weights
2011-11-17T14:41:06  <Fluxid> McLeopold: i can try..

2011-11-17T14:42:45  <Yexo> I'll try that now too
2011-11-17T14:42:46  <mcstar> i mean with massive load
2011-11-17T14:42:51  <g0llum> Surya, well that was my problem there, no idea now
2011-11-17T14:43:07  <Yexo> creating massive load might be a problem
2011-11-17T14:43:08  <McLeopold> just open a file for each bot and pass that in the 'input_logs' option
2011-11-17T14:43:11  <Yexo> unless I run the engine twice or so
2011-11-17T14:43:24  <mcstar> Yexo: i meant with many ants
2011-11-17T14:43:31  <Surya> g0llum, ok I'm gonna keep looking, thank you very much

2011-11-17T14:43:40  <magiik> can you generate maps with ants already on it right?

2011-11-17T14:44:14  <magiik> could probably kludge something together to generate a quick test map each turn
2011-11-17T14:44:20  <magiik> on each *round
2011-11-17T14:44:27  <mcstar> i heard there are scenarios, i dont know what they are but they sound connected to this
2011-11-17T14:44:41  <Yexo> a scenario is basically a map file with ants included
2011-11-17T14:44:43  <Surya> g0llum, last question: isn't it supposed to generate a website? I mean, it updates the sqlLite db but no website
2011-11-17T14:44:45  <Anilm3> what techniques are people using to walk through the map?
2011-11-17T14:44:58  <magiik> Anilm3: probably any ones u can think of?
2011-11-17T14:45:14  <mcstar> Yexo: perfect, no have a bot that just randomly goes somewhere, but check if the move was possible and the engine atually moved the ant
2011-11-17T14:45:20  <mcstar> now*
2011-11-17T14:45:57  <mcstar> i bet a thousand (imaginary) dollars you will not tbe able to replicate the bug locally
2011-11-17T14:46:03  <McLeopold> If anyone finds that this is a bug in the engine, put in a github issue
2011-11-17T14:46:36  <g0llum> Surya, i think, webserver.py is generating webpages frm that sqlite db
2011-11-17T14:46:46  <Anilm3> magiik: I was just asking for proper AI techniques, not your secrets, don't worry
2011-11-17T14:47:05  <McLeopold> Anilm3: what do you mean by walk? pathfinding?
2011-11-17T14:47:08  <magiik> Anilm3: yeah, i'm just saying, pretty much anything you can think of will/already is implemented
2011-11-17T14:47:29  <magiik> Anilm3: following walls, using pathfinding ( a lot of a* and BFS around here )
2011-11-17T14:47:46  <Jumbala> I just have a quick question... I'm starting to implement some things and I was wondering if it was possible for an ant to attack another ant on the other side of the map: example: I'm on the lowest tile and the enemy ant is on the highest tile, can I attack it since it is technically 1 tile away?
2011-11-17T14:47:52  <magiik> diffusion maps had a bit of popularity as well ( but i think it's just a tweaked subset of BFS )
2011-11-17T14:47:57  <Surya> g0llum, You installed one right? When I launch webserver.py it creates ressource files but no actual website. Did you make it until the end?
2011-11-17T14:48:01  <McLeopold> Jumbala: yes
2011-11-17T14:48:09  <Jumbala> Thank you!
2011-11-17T14:48:12  <Anilm3> magiik: thanks I'll take a look!
2011-11-17T14:48:15  <McLeopold> the ants cross the edges of the map
2011-11-17T14:48:45  <Anilm3> magiik: I have pathfinding (A*) just for known targets but not for exploring the map

2011-11-17T14:49:20  <magiik> Anilm3: for exploring the map - i use a diffusion map populated with explore goals - explore goals are generated based on the last seen values of each tile i record
2011-11-17T14:49:32  <g0llum> Surya, i sever seen anay resource files. just start it , and point your browser to localhost:2080
2011-11-17T14:49:36  <magiik> Anilm3: but you could easily do the same thing replacing dissuion maps with a*
2011-11-17T14:49:44  <magiik> maybe assign ants to explore goals, etc...
2011-11-17T14:49:53  <magiik> *diffusion
2011-11-17T14:50:14  <Surya> g0llum, ok and the tcpServer port should be the same or different?
2011-11-17T14:50:41  <magiik> hrm... mebe i should run a local tcp server and play my bots against each other
2011-11-17T14:50:43  <Anilm3> and do your ants form groups as they walk?
2011-11-17T14:50:52  <g0llum> different, since you can't have two servers on the same machine on the same port
2011-11-17T14:51:08  <magiik> Yexo: that might be another idea to explore - set up a local tcpserver and try to replicate it that way?
2011-11-17T14:51:47  <magiik> Anilm3: my ants actually spread as they walk - they only group when enemies are present - and that's sort of emergent behavior - they want to walk past the enemny ants - but the enemy ants prevent them from going, so they bunch up near the enemies
2011-11-17T14:51:57  <magiik> then once there are enough of my ants, they ignore the enemies and charge in
2011-11-17T14:53:17  <Anilm3> I'm watching your replays, quite nice

2011-11-17T15:02:37  <magiik> 2081 sounds like the tcp port

2011-11-17T15:05:56  <magiik> you could try setting it to 0 if you think that's the problem - but if the server stops responding, you wont ever tiem out the connection
2011-11-17T15:06:17  <Fluxid> changed options but gave to run_game old ones
2011-11-17T15:06:19  <Yexo> no, that timeout is fine
2011-11-17T15:06:30  <Yexo> it's for blocking operations, so it's basically per turn
2011-11-17T15:06:31  <g0llum> k.
2011-11-17T15:07:13  <magiik> and anyways - you can see the server got the move, cuz it's in the replay

2011-11-17T16:05:28  <pezzotto> hi guys
2011-11-17T16:05:43  <pezzotto> just a question of which I didn't find a good answer on the forums
2011-11-17T16:05:52  <pezzotto> how is time calculated?
2011-11-17T16:06:12  <pezzotto> is it the wall clock or the CPU time?
2011-11-17T16:06:21  <g0llum> walltime
2011-11-17T16:06:38  <pezzotto> ok
2011-11-17T16:06:51  <pezzotto> so which exactly is the C (or python) function to get the time?
2011-11-17T16:07:26  <Antimony> I have a C++ clock you can use if you want
2011-11-17T16:07:55  <pezzotto> I am using python, but I will gladly see the c++ code to get the right function
2011-11-17T16:08:26  <g0llum> in python, just time(), in c it's more complicated, since your os is mixing in
2011-11-17T16:08:56  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-39-97.chebnet.ru> has quit IRC ()
2011-11-17T16:09:53  <pezzotto> so is it not the time() function in c? (the one provided by time.h)
2011-11-17T16:10:08  <mcstar> pezzotto: gettimeofday
2011-11-17T16:10:15  <mcstar> that should do it
2011-11-17T16:11:34  <pezzotto> ok... so it's gettimeofday in C and time.time() in python, right?
2011-11-17T16:11:40  <thestinger> pezzotto: http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/time.html

2011-11-17T16:11:51  <pezzotto> great, thanks!
2011-11-17T16:12:16  <mcstar> however think about this choice of using python
2011-11-17T16:12:30  <Jak_o_Shadows> ?
2011-11-17T16:12:37  <pairofdice> Indeed
2011-11-17T16:12:53  <thestinger> gettimeofday() is the old POSIX way to do it, the new way is clock_gettime(), but I think you need -lrt passed to gcc for that
2011-11-17T16:13:15  <thestinger> anyway, either will get you all the precision you need
2011-11-17T16:13:27  <pezzotto> mcstar what does it mean "think about this choice of using python" ?
2011-11-17T16:13:35  <mcstar> pezzotto: only that
2011-11-17T16:13:40  <mcstar> i dont want to step on toes here
2011-11-17T16:13:47  <mcstar> so i remain unbiased
2011-11-17T16:13:48  <pezzotto> it's ok :-)
2011-11-17T16:13:58  <pezzotto> I know python has problems with speed
2011-11-17T16:14:34  <pezzotto> I have actually "outsourced" a few important bits to C and wrapped in python to gain an edge in speed
2011-11-17T16:14:46  <pezzotto> sometimes it's painful, but worthwhile
2011-11-17T16:14:59  <mcstar> only you can be the judge of that
2011-11-17T16:15:36  <pezzotto> I doubt many things I am doing with python could be done as easily with C++
2011-11-17T16:15:50  <mcstar> like what?
2011-11-17T16:16:11  <mcstar> there is no c++ interpreter, thats for sure
2011-11-17T16:16:19  <thestinger> there is
2011-11-17T16:16:23  <mcstar> (now dont enybody tell me otherwise)
2011-11-17T16:16:26  <thestinger> install cint from the aur :P
2011-11-17T16:16:39  <pezzotto> I am eavily relying on the introspection of python to change the behaviour of the ants in real time
2011-11-17T16:16:41  <mcstar> thestinger: there isnt im sure, you are kidding me
2011-11-17T16:16:59  <pezzotto> doing this in C++ will require a lot of if-then-else
2011-11-17T16:17:18  <thestinger> mcstar: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/509413/
2011-11-17T16:17:19  <mcstar> introspection might cost you more than an if/else
2011-11-17T16:17:27  <pezzotto> the results are quite good so far... I'll see how the competition goes
2011-11-17T16:17:45  <pezzotto> It costs me on time, but again I can outsource heavy bits in C++
2011-11-17T16:18:02  <mcstar> thestinger: i was kidding, but do you think its a viable alternative to gcc?
2011-11-17T16:18:10  <thestinger> no xD
2011-11-17T16:18:14  <mcstar> k
2011-11-17T16:18:16  <pezzotto> you'll be surprised by seeing that 90% of the computation is spent in 2-3% of your code
2011-11-17T16:18:17  <mcstar> i rest my case
2011-11-17T16:18:18  <thestinger> I think it's intended for development, it's slower than CPython
2011-11-17T16:18:44  <mcstar> pezzotto: why would i be surprised?
2011-11-17T16:19:06  <pezzotto> it's a generic "you".. people would be surprised :-)
2011-11-17T16:19:14  <thestinger> pezzotto: yeah, but that 2% is 60x slower when you're using python
2011-11-17T16:19:16  <mcstar> im not people
2011-11-17T16:19:22  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-17T16:19:27  <thestinger> instead of my combat code taking 10ms, it would take 600ms
2011-11-17T16:19:40  <pezzotto> <thestinger> yes, so that 2% is outsourced in C++ and wrapped around
2011-11-17T16:19:48  <thestinger> in pypy that would be a lot better, but it would still be 5x-10x slower
2011-11-17T16:19:53  <thestinger> well, how are you outsourcing it?
2011-11-17T16:19:56  <thestinger> ctypes is slow
2011-11-17T16:20:07  <mcstar> pezzotto: if you find it satisfying to write c when you started out with python, thats ok
2011-11-17T16:20:11  <mcstar> i wouldnt really do that
2011-11-17T16:20:11  <pezzotto> I've had some problems as the servers don't support boost.. so I had to hand code it
2011-11-17T16:20:15  <mcstar> no for this kind of project
2011-11-17T16:20:36  <pezzotto> I love C++... but not as much as I love python
2011-11-17T16:20:49  <pezzotto> it's simply elegant
2011-11-17T16:21:01  <mcstar> yes, but python is ugly

2011-11-17T16:37:36  <pairofdice> Mine assume they move
2011-11-17T16:37:46  <mcstar> mine too
2011-11-17T16:37:49  <pairofdice> Gets them dancing sometimes
2011-11-17T16:38:02  <mcstar> but im havin trouble recognizing sudden death situations with that
2011-11-17T16:38:28  <mcstar> and i havent found any enlightening ideas the hole day

2011-11-17T16:40:09  <mcstar> i even have trouble with the definition of "success"
2011-11-17T16:40:21  <thestinger> yeah, I'm having trouble deciding that atm
2011-11-17T16:40:23  <pairofdice> I've found many, not any that would help my ants though
2011-11-17T16:41:08  <thestinger> I simulate what would happen with ants in a certain location (after moving), and I know which allies/enemies will die
2011-11-17T16:41:24  <mcstar> i have move generation too
2011-11-17T16:41:37  <mcstar> i resolve every such battle situation
2011-11-17T16:41:42  <mcstar> but i have trouble with the scoring
2011-11-17T16:41:52  <mcstar> and it doesnt really work for ~10 ants
2011-11-17T16:41:55  <thestinger> letting my ants trade 2 enemy deaths for 1 death doesn't work since I assume the enemies stay still - it makes them too aggressive
2011-11-17T16:41:58  *** ltriant <ltriant!~ltriant@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-17T16:42:14  <thestinger> so I've just left them really cautious for now
2011-11-17T16:42:28  <thestinger> I think I'll adjust the losses they are willing to take based on % of the map I control or something
2011-11-17T16:42:36  <mcstar> if i make them cautious, they wont attack cooperatively even if they could win
2011-11-17T16:42:53  <thestinger> mine do since I'm pretending the enemy is stationary
2011-11-17T16:43:05  <thestinger> but it makes them do stupid stuff a lot
2011-11-17T16:43:16  <thestinger> like moving 1 ant towards where 2 enemy ants are about to move
2011-11-17T16:43:50  <mcstar> maybe i should just use a neural net library and train it with random input
2011-11-17T16:43:54  <thestinger> I think for the big battles this way is going to work, since the lines of combat are fairly static
2011-11-17T16:43:57  <pairofdice> Lots to tune with my ants. But my next bot will be c++
2011-11-17T16:44:29  <pairofdice> It's funny though, I looked at your #18 bot and no combat at all :)
2011-11-17T16:44:29  <thestinger> for the small battles, you really need to see what would happen if the enemies move
2011-11-17T16:44:43  <thestinger> yeah, that's an old version
2011-11-17T16:44:54  <thestinger> it also has really crappy foraging and other problems
2011-11-17T16:45:02  <pairofdice> And still #18
2011-11-17T16:45:21  <thestinger> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/strcat_rewrite this is what I'm working on atm
2011-11-17T16:46:05  <thestinger> lots of new problems to deal with - I need to adjust aggressiveness (they are too cautious now) and need to reteach my ants to actively strafe/encircle enemies
2011-11-17T16:46:57  <mcstar> my bot sucks because it loses its hill very early

2011-11-17T16:47:18  <mcstar> i didnt want to think about defending my hill until ive done battle
2011-11-17T16:47:24  <mcstar> maybe i should have done that first
2011-11-17T16:47:46  <thestinger> I have various defense methods implemented in branches, but they all make my bot worse
2011-11-17T16:47:48  <thestinger> :(
2011-11-17T16:48:03  <mcstar> but still you dont lose your hill
2011-11-17T16:48:10  <thestinger> I often do
2011-11-17T16:48:11  <mcstar> you would not have gotten to #18
2011-11-17T16:48:26  <thestinger> that version only got that high b/c it rushes at enemy hills and gets early points
2011-11-17T16:48:38  <thestinger> it can't survive long against the top 25 bots
2011-11-17T16:49:33  <thestinger> I rotate direction preferences, so there are usually ants leaving my hills from a few directions which sort of defends against scouts
2011-11-17T16:49:40  <thestinger> my rewrite doesn't actually do that atm
2011-11-17T16:49:49  <thestinger> and it has new movement issues now >.<

2011-11-17T17:03:50  <bugnuts2> ChrisH_ did you see http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=1900
2011-11-17T17:04:23  <bugnuts2> pguillory mentioning inconsistent performance for Go
2011-11-17T17:05:02  <bugnuts2> not something I am seeing (except maybe with a lot of logging...)
2011-11-17T17:05:54  <thestinger> bugnuts2: the regular Go compilers don't really optimize beyond turning your code into efficient assembly
2011-11-17T17:06:10  <thestinger> they don't inline, do loop unrolling, or any of the fancy optimizations that gcc and llvm can do
2011-11-17T17:06:17  <ikaros> i dont think running gc manually guarantees that it doesnt run on its own?!
2011-11-17T17:06:19  <thestinger> they're meant to compile stuff stuff really fast
2011-11-17T17:06:47  <bugnuts2> not concerned about slow really more unpredictable performance
2011-11-17T17:07:18  <thestinger> well, the garbage collector is also really immature - there's a complete rewrite of it in the development branch and weekly release now I think
2011-11-17T17:07:24  <bugnuts2> I track the per turn GC pauses and they are very short for my bot
2011-11-17T17:08:06  <bugnuts2> the immaturity of the gc is more in the context of mulithreaded apps.
2011-11-17T17:08:26  <thestinger> that makes sense
2011-11-17T17:09:18  <bugnuts2> and in any case I see 2-3 GC invocations per turn with an aggregate pause of typically 1500us
2011-11-17T17:10:51  <thestinger> I guess the goroutine scheduler could be doing something weird
2011-11-17T17:12:12  <bugnuts2> hard to imagine it causing a swing that big.
2011-11-17T17:12:39  <thestinger> a context switch could totally screw up caching I guess?
2011-11-17T17:13:51  <thestinger> I think there's a compiler flag to disable bounds checking which should be a speed gain without breaking any bots
2011-11-17T17:13:58  <bugnuts2> context switches in go are basically free for goroutines in a single threaded environment I think.
2011-11-17T17:14:11  <thestinger> yeah, b/c there's no locking
2011-11-17T17:14:27  <thestinger> but you're still switching to different code, so the CPU cache is going to suffer
2011-11-17T17:15:32  <bugnuts2> yeah but cache misses are orders of magnitude cheaper than the 50ms swings in timing he is mentioning.

2011-11-17T17:44:14  <mcstar> vs?
2011-11-17T17:44:19  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-17T17:44:20  <mcstar> they server different purposes
2011-11-17T17:44:40  <mcstar> id never search in a list for example
2011-11-17T17:44:50  <thestinger> I know, but for some of the small sets I have, the hash-based unordered_set is probably overkill
2011-11-17T17:44:50  <mcstar> i just dont like double loops
2011-11-17T17:44:53  <janzert> you might want to check that the tcp client shuts off nagle congestion control when creating the connection to the server

2011-11-17T17:45:18  <janzert> hmm
2011-11-17T17:45:22  <thestinger>     sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
2011-11-17T17:45:25  <thestinger>     #sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)
2011-11-17T17:45:30  <thestinger> that's what I tried (the second line is what I added)
2011-11-17T17:45:47  <janzert> weird
2011-11-17T17:45:55  <thestinger> it just seemed to cause non-stop timeouts so I commented it out for now

2011-11-17T17:48:10  <mcstar> actually im not sure now
2011-11-17T17:48:21  <mcstar> btu i think i flush after every line
2011-11-17T17:48:27  <thestinger> std::endl; flushes the stream
2011-11-17T17:48:40  <mcstar> ah, no \n

2011-11-17T19:08:45  <Zao> QtWin's gcc 4.4 needs it anyway.

2011-11-17T19:10:27  <mcstar> not complaining
2011-11-17T19:10:39  <mcstar> but my source of c++/c++11 features doesnt mention this

2011-11-17T19:53:23  <Weird> anyone have a clue what that might be about? (as I don't ever use error codes to throw stuff)

2011-11-17T19:54:08  <Weird> and because the game 'randomly crashed'
2011-11-17T19:54:14  <Weird> I put a try / catch around the whole thing
2011-11-17T19:54:31  <amstan> how about letting the errors go?

2011-11-17T20:06:17  <Weird> hmmm it blocks some move, but that shouldn't really make it stop doing stuff right?
2011-11-17T20:06:27  <ikaros> dont think so

2011-11-17T20:08:26  <amstan> Weird: remove the try catch
2011-11-17T20:08:50  <Weird> ye I removed the try / catch

2011-11-17T20:09:11  <amstan> and you have -E and it crashes without anything while saying that on stderr?

2011-11-17T20:41:12  <thestinger> :)
2011-11-17T20:41:50  <roflmao> and that was for non-moving targets?
2011-11-17T20:42:00  <roflmao> so you just rolled with that and it was still relatively betteR?
2011-11-17T20:42:09  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-17T20:42:35  <roflmao> nice!
2011-11-17T20:42:39  <roflmao> now get it working for moving targets
2011-11-17T20:42:43  <roflmao> and it'll be a beast
2011-11-17T20:42:51  <thestinger> my bot now has some flaws that don't exist in my old version so I'm going to fix those first
2011-11-17T20:42:54  <thestinger> mostly movement stuff
2011-11-17T20:43:16  <roflmao> wow skill of 44

2011-11-17T20:43:37  <thestinger> no combat and crappy foraging
2011-11-17T20:44:13  <thestinger> I think it should be around rank 25-30, but it got lucky in a few games
2011-11-17T20:45:01  <roflmao> can't wait to try my code -- once i get this stupid machine working lol
2011-11-17T20:46:38  <thestinger> atm, I'm switching around container types and refactoring
2011-11-17T20:46:57  <thestinger> I ended up abusing some vectors/lists with my new code (searching through linked lists...)
2011-11-17T20:48:35  <roflmao> are you going to try to get combat working for moving targets
2011-11-17T20:48:41  <roflmao> or are you just going to keep your current new combat code
2011-11-17T20:49:25  <thestinger> I think I'll end up using this code for _all_ my ants, because it's fast

2011-11-17T20:50:16  <thestinger> big battles seem to mostly be big static battle lines, so I should be fine with those (and trying to use minimax or something there would be way too slow)

2011-11-17T20:52:37  <roflmao> what i want to implement though is zapping for the ants that are NOT part of the battle line

2011-11-17T20:53:22  <thestinger> yeah, my combat code doesn't protect my foragers because they don't realize they're stepping into a place 2 enemies are about to be able to attack

2011-11-17T21:40:16  <Antimony> The good news: I reduced my bot's move time from 11 seconds to 4
2011-11-17T21:40:23  <Antimony> The bad news: It's still takes 4 seconds to move!
2011-11-17T21:40:37  <avdg> wow, is it really that long? :p
2011-11-17T21:40:45  <thestinger> does that include game trees or something?
2011-11-17T21:41:01  <Antimony> That's the itme for my new constraint solver
2011-11-17T21:41:02  <avdg> well, I quited my js bot when it needed 200ms to move 50 bots :/
2011-11-17T21:41:08  <Antimony> My old one could solve it in like 50ms
2011-11-17T21:41:20  <Antimony> I'm not sure why my new version is slower
2011-11-17T21:41:38  <avdg> did you add features?
2011-11-17T21:41:46  <Antimony> no
2011-11-17T21:41:56  <Antimony> I think the reason is that I changed from DFS to UCS
2011-11-17T21:42:19  <Antimony> But UCS should be faster
2011-11-17T21:42:47  <avdg> well, I hope you can easily revert your choices, so you can easily compare both
2011-11-17T21:42:55  <avdg> there are probably some constrains
2011-11-17T21:43:30  <Antimony> My old system was a mess

2011-11-17T21:44:46  <Antimony> and it was supposed to be a lot faster too
2011-11-17T21:44:47  <avdg> heh, I wished I could use my js bot without much delay
2011-11-17T21:45:10  <avdg> but I failed with it after I added coverage trackers
2011-11-17T21:45:28  <avdg> which wasn't that much code, but still making the bot 10 times slower

2011-11-17T21:47:25  <avdg> yeah, I was thinking about it
2011-11-17T21:47:33  <avdg> but I was worried about making it inefficient
2011-11-17T21:48:04  <avdg> but anyway
2011-11-17T21:48:06  <Antimony> just code it first and worry about efficiency later
2011-11-17T21:48:09  <Antimony> that's what I did
2011-11-17T21:48:25  <Antimony> unless you have measurable delay, there's no reason to spend effort optimizing it
2011-11-17T21:48:30  <avdg> yeah, but I don't know c++ that well, thats why I was worried
2011-11-17T21:48:41  <Antimony> especially since you have no way of knowing whether the change acutally worked
2011-11-17T21:49:30  <avdg> yeah, let me dig into the do-it-yourself direction (despite I hoped c++ had a little bit more to offer)
2011-11-17T21:49:53  <thestinger> why not just use the existing array implementations?

2011-11-17T21:50:09  <thestinger> std::vector is fine for a 2d array (or std::array if you really care about stack vs. heap)
2011-11-17T21:50:13  <Antimony> like what? boost?
2011-11-17T21:50:15  <Weird> well if you can make something more speed efficient by design it's usualy a good idea to start with that ;p
2011-11-17T21:50:24  <avdg> I want it fixed size once set up
2011-11-17T21:50:29  <thestinger> so, std::array
2011-11-17T21:50:32  <avdg> dunno if a vector fits in that

2011-11-17T22:01:47  <thestinger> bool is 1-byte and not 1 bit for a reason :)
2011-11-17T22:01:55  <thestinger> using individual bits will be slower, but saves memory
2011-11-17T22:02:31  <avdg> oh well, then I probably want to take that cost as well
2011-11-17T22:03:13  <thestinger> the C way would be to make a struct to hold them (you can do bit fields in a struct, but just using 2 bools is better)
2011-11-17T22:03:29  <thestinger> C++ has std::pair and std::tuple which are basically just anonymous structs
2011-11-17T22:03:39  <thestinger> std::pair<bool, bool> looks like what you want

2011-11-17T22:04:16  <avdg> yeah, it gets close
2011-11-17T22:04:36  <avdg> but my brains don't believe it yet :p not that I don't trust you ;-)
2011-11-17T22:05:46  <Yexo> std::vector<bool> uses only 1 bit per entry
2011-11-17T22:06:09  <Yexo> otherwise it's almost certainly faster to use at least one byte (and possible a double-word) per tile
2011-11-17T22:06:17  <thestinger> Yexo: I think they fixed that in C++11
2011-11-17T22:06:58  <Yexo> the std::vector<bool> thing?

2011-11-17T22:07:51  <thestinger> maybe not
2011-11-17T22:08:49  <thestinger> yeah, I guess they didn't fix it
2011-11-17T22:09:25  <thestinger> you can just use uint8_t from cstdint though
