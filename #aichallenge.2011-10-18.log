2011-10-18T00:00:12  <janzert> when we go live they'll be pointed at aichallenge.org yeah
2011-10-18T00:00:58  <janzert> we're still a go for Thursday night right?
2011-10-18T00:01:49  <janzert> what is your TTL on aichallenge.org right now?
2011-10-18T00:02:11  <amstan> janzert: low, i'll set it to high when we launch
2011-10-18T00:02:20  <amstan> by low i mean 2 min
2011-10-18T00:02:20  <janzert> good :)
2011-10-18T00:02:23  <janzert> hehe
2011-10-18T00:02:36  <janzert> 1 or 2 hours would be fine
2011-10-18T00:02:38  <amstan> janzert: ok, can you check the configs now?
2011-10-18T00:02:39  *** moondust <moondust!91219@swan.dds.nl> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2011-10-18T00:02:59  <amstan> we should still have a redirect from beta.aichallenge.org now, because we used it for a while
2011-10-18T00:03:08  *** moondust <moondust!91219@swan.dds.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-18T00:03:12  <amstan> and.. we need a redirect from the main server to this one, or repoint the domain
2011-10-18T00:03:24  <amstan> yeah, repoint the domain..
2011-10-18T00:03:35  <janzert> hmm? beta.aichallenge.org should just go away after launch
2011-10-18T00:03:50  <janzert> not sure what you mean about the main server redirect
2011-10-18T00:04:01  <amstan> ai-contest.com should point at the new server too
2011-10-18T00:04:08  <janzert> right
2011-10-18T00:04:13  <amstan> but let's do that at launch
2011-10-18T00:04:26  <janzert> actually...
2011-10-18T00:04:48  <amstan> like.. i still don't have access to that yet
2011-10-18T00:04:58  <janzert> you could go ahead and set the aichallenge.org TTL high now and I'll reassign the current IP address to the correct server at launch
2011-10-18T00:05:06  <janzert> :(
2011-10-18T00:05:24  <amstan> ok, sure
2011-10-18T00:05:59  <nomad_man> quick: if you remmeber wha't the funtion that actually passes input to the bot?  i want to run it in debug mode and mnaully feed it to the bot :)

2011-10-18T00:06:12  <nomad_man> quick q*
2011-10-18T00:06:28  <amstan> janzert: 107.20.156.231 ?
2011-10-18T00:06:58  <janzert> amstan: yep
2011-10-18T00:07:29  <amstan> why can't i ping it?
2011-10-18T00:07:42  * amstan upped to 8 hours
2011-10-18T00:07:55  <janzert> ICMP is probably blocked
2011-10-18T00:08:06  <amstan> aww
2011-10-18T00:08:52  <janzert> yeah, it's only allowing ssh and http through atm
2011-10-18T00:09:03  <amstan> janzert: so.. everything should be a 301 to aichallenge.org then?
2011-10-18T00:09:09  <janzert> nomad_man: I don't really recall the path through the engine to the bot fully offhand
2011-10-18T00:09:21  <janzert> the actual sending function would be in sandbox.py though
2011-10-18T00:09:34  <janzert> I think playgame has a debug option but I'm not sure how verbose that is
2011-10-18T00:09:34  <nomad_man> janzert:  no worries,  thanks, i'll hunt it down there than
2011-10-18T00:09:53  <nomad_man> janzert: i'm already with verbose says nothign of interest, i want to mnaully feed the stream
2011-10-18T00:10:02  <nomad_man> with debugger attached, and step through
2011-10-18T00:10:05  <janzert> amstan: everything as in?
2011-10-18T00:10:34  <amstan> [www].ai-contest.com www.aichallenge.org aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com beta.aichallenge.org
2011-10-18T00:11:07  <janzert> nomad_man: http://beta.aichallenge.org/specification.php might give you enough for you to feed to your bot
2011-10-18T00:11:46  <janzert> I'd just drop the beta urls, but I suppose they can be redirected if you really want ;)
2011-10-18T00:11:57  <nomad_man> janzert: yeah i saw that, but it takes the regular input no problme, for w/e reason.  however on testing the submission crashes
2011-10-18T00:12:01  <amstan> they're in google, and i don't want that
2011-10-18T00:12:05  <janzert> the others though 301 would seem appropriate for sure
2011-10-18T00:12:22  <janzert> they should disappear pretty quickly though
2011-10-18T00:12:27  <amstan> and we're pretty much migrating from it, so might as well
2011-10-18T00:12:30  <janzert> once they're no longer around
2011-10-18T00:13:11  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-18T00:13:41  <amstan> k, antsbeta.janzert still works
2011-10-18T00:13:57  <amstan> janzert: now.. what do you think about my archiving stuff?
2011-10-18T00:14:14  <janzert> I like a subdomain and separate server as well
2011-10-18T00:14:21  <janzert> subdomain per game probably
2011-10-18T00:14:24  <amstan> good
2011-10-18T00:14:34  <janzert> but all the archives can probably live on one server
2011-10-18T00:14:38  <janzert> hopefully
2011-10-18T00:14:42  <amstan> of course
2011-10-18T00:15:26  <amstan> we've put off doing the ones before, and somehow there's random data dissapearing from them
2011-10-18T00:15:46  <janzert> too bad we couldn't redirect current planetwars urls to the right spot in the archive as well
2011-10-18T00:15:46  <amstan> ex: from tron, replays aren't working anymore
2011-10-18T00:15:59  <janzert> yeah, I've noticed
2011-10-18T00:15:59  <amstan> can't we?
2011-10-18T00:16:16  <janzert> many of them are the same urls we're now using for ants I think
2011-10-18T00:16:17  <amstan> i guess we can't
2011-10-18T00:16:24  <amstan> too bad
2011-10-18T00:16:52  <amstan> anyway, so tron has missing replays
2011-10-18T00:17:11  <amstan> what probably happened is that csc got annoyed at having 5GB in the mysql db, so they deleted a table or something
2011-10-18T00:17:23  <amstan> i don't blame them
2011-10-18T00:17:57  <amstan> janzert: oh yeah, have you seen the video?
2011-10-18T00:17:59  <janzert> should we make the live site (except for the frontpage) live at ants.aichallenge.org?
2011-10-18T00:18:15  <janzert> just a thought not really sure if it's a good idea or not
2011-10-18T00:18:25  <janzert> I did see the video
2011-10-18T00:18:33  <janzert> nice little intro
2011-10-18T00:18:38  <amstan> janzert: seems like a good idea, the only problem i have with is what if there's more than 1 ants game
2011-10-18T00:18:54  <amstan> but i think mcleopold said we should just go ants2 and so on
2011-10-18T00:18:59  <amstan> i'm fine with that
2011-10-18T00:19:10  <janzert> I'm not sure it should keep playing the game after the explanation has finished
2011-10-18T00:19:17  *** dvladim <dvladim!~dvladim@85.113.131.65> has quit IRC (Read error: Operation timed out)
2011-10-18T00:19:30  <janzert> or use a date based subdomain
2011-10-18T00:19:35  <janzert> but I'm not sure what offhand
2011-10-18T00:19:54  <amstan> that's kinda ugly, it should be semantic, date is too numeric
2011-10-18T00:20:52  <janzert> or aichallenge.org/ants/... ?
2011-10-18T00:21:02  <janzert> not sure
2011-10-18T00:21:24  <janzert> think I like the subdomain slightly more
2011-10-18T00:21:36  <amstan> folders means we need proxies going
2011-10-18T00:21:45  <amstan> otherwise they have to be on the same server
2011-10-18T00:21:53  <janzert> the folder would only be for the current contest
2011-10-18T00:22:24  <janzert> use a subdomain and then it can be transparently moved to the archive server later
2011-10-18T00:23:15  <janzert> the folder idea was just that it would be easy to set up a redirect for it later
2011-10-18T00:23:50  <amstan> idk about folders yet, let me think about it
2011-10-18T00:23:54  <amstan> i should also sleep
2011-10-18T00:24:02  <amstan> workers going ok then?
2011-10-18T00:24:16  <janzert> ok, and I've pretty much talked myself out of folders already anyway :)
2011-10-18T00:24:20  <janzert> yep, seem to be fine
2011-10-18T00:24:33  <amstan> lol
2011-10-18T00:31:01  <Larose> mleise: I found why my bot timed out. I was using std::cin directly to read an int. When my bot was reading player_seed, std::cin stop working properly. So now I read the parameter with a string then I do a conversion to an int via a stringstream. (I should point out that the c++ starter package also uses directly std::cin to read an int value, but it doesn't read the parameter "player_seed", that is why it doesn't time out)
2011-10-18T00:31:31  <amstan> Larose: are you flushing?
2011-10-18T00:31:48  <Larose> Yes

2011-10-18T00:33:38  <janzert> Larose: the player_seed is a 64bit int
2011-10-18T00:33:40  <Larose> My bot was ok with "normal" seeds. But the seed in the test case seems "huge".
2011-10-18T00:34:03  <janzert> or it is on 64bit platforms anyway which the contest servers are
2011-10-18T00:34:57  <Larose> From the website: "All numbers will be 32 bit signed integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647) converted to strings"
2011-10-18T00:35:15  <janzert> hmm, where is that? it's wrong
2011-10-18T00:35:19  <Larose> http://aichallenge.org/specification.php
2011-10-18T00:36:05  <Larose> So we should read that "All numbers will be 64 bits signed integers"?
2011-10-18T00:36:57  <janzert> that whole thing is a little bit off, the value type should be determined by the parameter type being parsed
2011-10-18T00:37:24  <janzert> but all the parameters except player_seed currently are 32bit integers

2011-10-18T01:06:46  <nomad_man> here is another question
2011-10-18T01:07:07  <nomad_man> what does "status invalid survived"  means after the test script
2011-10-18T01:07:28  <nomad_man> bot no longer crashes, but that's what i get :)
2011-10-18T01:08:02  <janzert> I think invalid means the bot sent invalid output
2011-10-18T01:08:24  <nomad_man> ah, i was trying my debug version
2011-10-18T01:08:50  <janzert> be sure to send any debug output to stderr instead of stdout
2011-10-18T01:09:33  <nomad_man> true, i'll re-test my release version, will find out
2011-10-18T01:10:16  <nomad_man> yep, working now
2011-10-18T01:10:28  <nomad_man> janzert: excellent tip, saved me a tonn of time :)
2011-10-18T01:12:16  <knups> What i should do if the letter with activation code dont sent to me?
2011-10-18T01:13:26  <janzert> knups: first thing is just double check your spam folder, the subject should be "Google AI Challenge!"
2011-10-18T01:14:12  <nomad_man> this challenge is an excellent way to learn C#
2011-10-18T01:14:15  <nomad_man> thanks guys :)

2011-10-18T05:50:51  <mcstar> maybe
2011-10-18T05:55:05  <manzurmm> mcstar: and?
2011-10-18T05:55:37  <mcstar> to what end?

2011-10-18T05:55:44  <mcstar> to what and?
2011-10-18T05:55:47  <mcstar> :D
2011-10-18T05:56:00  <mcstar> i answered your question as honestly as i could
2011-10-18T05:56:21  <mcstar> i not sure, but there can be someone who might just know when it will actually start
2011-10-18T05:56:24  <mcstar> im*
2011-10-18T05:59:33  <manzurmm> mcstar: cute answer, but absolutely useless

2011-10-18T11:36:08  <jfhs> i wrote bot, but it takes so much time for it to play some games
2011-10-18T11:36:27  <jfhs> about 2 hours to play one game
2011-10-18T11:36:42  <jfhs> now it says me
2011-10-18T11:36:43  <jfhs> 86 players are ahead.
2011-10-18T11:36:43  <jfhs> The current game rate is about 3.9 players per minute.
2011-10-18T11:36:43  <jfhs> Next game should be within 59.3 minutes.
2011-10-18T11:37:07  <jfhs> so..86/3.9 ~ 22 min
2011-10-18T11:37:24  <jfhs> but the time he gives me is ~3 times greater

2011-10-18T12:00:36  <mleise> If it wasn't made more public, it is probably because we often had to change the launch date again and again.

2011-10-18T12:22:32  <mcstar> Accoun: is there a semantic difference?
2011-10-18T12:23:04  <Accoun> wrong coment in pithon code

2011-10-18T12:32:36  <rabidus> just making some shitstorm
2011-10-18T12:32:54  <rabidus> boring down here
2011-10-18T12:33:10  <mcstar> you kidding? the best 15 minutes ever
2011-10-18T12:34:45  <Larose> Is this always valid? From the website: "Food will also block an ants movement. This can happen if food spawns next to an ant. Don't move the ant and it will be gathered the next turn."
2011-10-18T12:37:26  <mcstar> what do you mean "always"?
2011-10-18T12:37:34  <mcstar> the circumstances are listed
2011-10-18T12:38:15  <mcstar> you cant approach a food-tile without "eating" it
2011-10-18T12:38:30  <Larose> I mean, is this still valid? An ant can be blocked by a spawing food
2011-10-18T12:38:30  <mcstar> you can only get next to it, when it is spawned there
2011-10-18T12:38:51  <mcstar> the question is, does the engine spawn food next to ants
2011-10-18T12:39:03  <mcstar> if it does, than i think it can happen
2011-10-18T12:39:36  <mleise> On a completely different note, I think I can add a feature to the visualizer that allows us to recreate bot input from the replay.
2011-10-18T12:41:13  <mleise> I haven't looked at the details yet. It may be that it will lack some information.
2011-10-18T12:43:09  <amstan> mleise: feature that does it in real time? or just dump the whole output?
2011-10-18T12:46:49  <mleise> amstan: not sure what you mean. I imagine this being a button in the visualizer. When you click on it either the current turn or the whole replay is instantly rewritten to what the engine has sent to the bot when the game was played.
2011-10-18T12:47:00  <amstan> ic, ok
2011-10-18T12:47:01  <mleise> This should help a lot with debugging.
2011-10-18T12:47:10  <amstan> yeah, that's what i meant by realtime: current turn
2011-10-18T12:47:12  <Accoun> I think U need add a feature to the visualizer that allows us to recreate bot input from the replay.
2011-10-18T12:47:42  <mleise> Accoun: I think you need to read!
2011-10-18T12:47:43  <mcstar> good idea
2011-10-18T12:47:49  <amstan> Accoun: yes, that's what he said

2011-10-18T13:07:36  <McLeopold> in the starter pack

2011-10-18T13:08:24  <amstan> now sure how jars work, right now i'm just compiling all *.java to *.class
2011-10-18T13:08:32  <amstan> and the contest runs mybot.class somehow
2011-10-18T13:08:45  <amstan> to be a jar you would need to add all classes together

2011-10-18T13:17:01  <Accoun> read log of this chat, he say it before
2011-10-18T13:17:44  <McLeopold> Accoun: we do have some map specifications, read at the end of the spec page here: http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#Map-Format
2011-10-18T13:18:15  <McLeopold> The important ones are 3x3 traversable, no islands and hills distances
2011-10-18T13:18:48  <McLeopold> That should give you a good handle on effecient path finding and blocking
2011-10-18T13:18:53  <a1k0n> accoun has a point, though.  at the upper echelons of the ranks, the particular map generator will favor some bots over others where they would be equally matched on an empty map

2011-10-18T13:19:28  <Accoun> it no enough
2011-10-18T13:19:36  <Accoun> no reson to play it if map generator not part of rules
2011-10-18T13:19:55  <Accoun> and map generation procedure
2011-10-18T13:21:34  <Accoun> mower to meke map set is like map hack in Star Craft
2011-10-18T13:21:42  <Accoun> power to make map set is like map hack in Star Craft
2011-10-18T13:21:47  <McLeopold> a1k0n: the map specs should be open enough that no 1 strategy can dominate
2011-10-18T13:22:07  <McLeopold> and, since we will be open to new map generators, the dominate strategies may shift
2011-10-18T13:22:19  <Accoun> it no enough
2011-10-18T13:23:03  <McLeopold> I consider it part of the problem spec that you should shift strategies based on the map type as you discover it
2011-10-18T13:23:14  <Accoun> the dominate strategies may shift by some peples power
2011-10-18T13:23:24  <delt0r> yep
2011-10-18T13:23:28  <delt0r> so what?
2011-10-18T13:23:37  <Accoun> so no reson to play it if map generator not part of rules
2011-10-18T13:23:44  <delt0r> so don't play
2011-10-18T13:23:47  <Accoun> lusing time
2011-10-18T13:23:47  <delt0r> that works

2011-10-18T13:24:18  <a1k0n> but the tcp contest is even less-specified
2011-10-18T13:24:28  <a1k0n> who knows what maps will be on there
2011-10-18T13:24:30  <delt0r> the tcp is not part of the contest --is just for testing
2011-10-18T13:24:49  <delt0r> and the server admin can enter and its really easy to hack it
2011-10-18T13:25:07  <McLeopold> Accoun: the organizers are from Canada, USA, Austrialia and Germany, and maybe other countries as well.

2011-10-18T14:00:03  <amstan> and rankings are at most 2 minutes old
2011-10-18T14:00:12  <amstan> at one point we close them, and just run games
2011-10-18T14:00:15  <amstan> that's the final rankings
2011-10-18T14:00:19  <nomad_man> amstan:  how long does it run for? (contest)
2011-10-18T14:00:30  <amstan> about 2 months
2011-10-18T14:00:32  <nomad_man> amstan: but if you resubmit the algorithm, your rankings is reset to 0
2011-10-18T14:00:38  <amstan> yes
2011-10-18T14:00:55  <nomad_man> what are you using for rankings ELO?

2011-10-18T14:02:31  <ChrisH_> nomad_man: I'm pretty sure they use TrueSkill (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill)
2011-10-18T14:02:40  <ChrisH_> nomad_man: or a close approximation
2011-10-18T14:03:07  <Guest42089> where can i get PlayGame.jar? It doesnt come with starter package neither tools
2011-10-18T14:03:26  <nomad_man> ChrisH_: coool, very nice didn't know about TrueSkill, thanks
2011-10-18T14:03:37  <nomad_man> amstan: thanks for doing all the work guys, it looks awesome.

2011-10-18T14:05:17  <Guest42089> is there a way to run my bot without installing python?
2011-10-18T14:05:42  <amstan> Guest42089: directly on the website, but it will be a slow process
2011-10-18T14:05:49  <amstan> Guest42089: you can also ssh in another comp that does have python
2011-10-18T14:05:58  <nomad_man> amstan:  remote dev is a pain :)
2011-10-18T14:06:08  <amstan> or you can build your own engine, in a language that you like better than python
2011-10-18T14:06:21  <amstan> but you might want to install python to run the engine to compare against
2011-10-18T14:06:24  <nomad_man> thank god i had python installed on this windows box
2011-10-18T14:06:25  <ChrisH_> The current rankings page is currently screwed up.
2011-10-18T14:06:51  <nomad_man> ChrisH_: how so?
2011-10-18T14:07:23  <ChrisH_> It wasn't showing all the entries.  It seems to be fixed now though.
2011-10-18T14:07:50  <Guest42089> i know c++ and java but i dont know how to run visualizer to test my bot now
2011-10-18T14:08:18  <amstan> Guest42089: the visualizer takes in replay files
2011-10-18T14:08:49  <Guest42089> i mean to watch bots fighting
2011-10-18T14:09:25  <ChrisH_> With all the new submissions over the last couple of days the game rate has really dropped.  Four hours between games is painful.

2011-10-18T14:11:42  <ChrisH_> janzert: Or there is a problem with the matchu system, why for example does sxyuan get 97 matches in 24 hours?
2011-10-18T14:11:58  <amstan> janzert: aarossig is working at a company to replace their desktop comps
2011-10-18T14:12:08  <amstan> they're 1.6ghz core2duos at 64bit
2011-10-18T14:12:10  <janzert> ChrisH_: yeah, I think there are still problems in the pairing
2011-10-18T14:12:11  <amstan> like 10 of them
2011-10-18T14:12:16  <amstan> he was wondering if we could use them as workers
2011-10-18T14:13:04  <janzert> amstan: certainly not mixed with ec2 workers and overall I'd rather not at this stage
2011-10-18T14:13:07  <amstan> well.. wtf? 300 new users in the last 24 hours?
2011-10-18T14:13:43  <janzert> it's a whole new environment to change to
2011-10-18T14:13:54  <ChrisH_> janzert: It would seem so
2011-10-18T14:13:57  <janzert> it is tempting though :}
2011-10-18T14:14:21  <janzert> ChrisH_: be sure to mention it to McLeopold if you see him
2011-10-18T14:14:33  <amstan> janzert: what are you concerned about? deployment?
2011-10-18T14:14:36  <amstan> janzert: or cpu differences?
2011-10-18T14:14:40  <ChrisH_> janzert: I did upstream.
2011-10-18T14:14:48  <janzert> deployment and running
2011-10-18T14:14:58  <janzert> gotta go for a while
2011-10-18T14:15:13  <amstan> janzert: i can teach aarosig how to admin them, and i can do it myself too
2011-10-18T14:17:52  <ChrisH_> @later tell McLeopold The pairing system is struggling to keep the game rates at similar levels. There are currently a few submissions getting nearly 100 games/day and others that are getting as few as 7 games/day. Also the high rate of resubmission (which jump to the front of the queue) seems to be nearly starving the rest of the queue.
2011-10-18T14:17:52  <contestbot> ChrisH_: Yes master!

2011-10-18T14:30:25  <amstan> i mean more like a blog

2011-10-18T14:32:04  <mcstar> a forum post somewhere

2011-10-18T14:32:13  <mcstar> hm
2011-10-18T14:32:47  <mcstar> ai-class is topic on #lisp
2011-10-18T14:33:32  <janzert> amstan: that reminds me we should get google analytics set up before the launch
2011-10-18T14:33:40  <amstan> oh yes
2011-10-18T14:33:45  <amstan> k, i need a list
2011-10-18T14:33:49  <mcstar> haha i found the site that lead me first here!

2011-10-18T14:34:09  <mcstar> i found these graphs very informative
2011-10-18T14:34:10  <janzert> preferably in a way that the analytics code doesn't need to be checked into git
2011-10-18T14:34:48  <amstan> janzert: we can use serverinfo.php or w/e
2011-10-18T14:35:20  <janzert> I thought the latest analytics code is suppose to live in the <head>?
2011-10-18T14:35:55  <amstan> janzert: yes, we can get some php to put the code in the proper javascript section in head
2011-10-18T14:36:32  <janzert> yeah, it'll just need another point that will pull in an external file

2011-10-18T14:41:22  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: The matchup generator is teasing me. Everytime I get down to 10 players ahead of me it jumps back  up to 12 (I assume because of new submissions).
2011-10-18T14:41:22  <amstan> janzert: as a launch checklist
2011-10-18T14:41:34  <janzert> ok :)
2011-10-18T14:41:40  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: This time it jumped to 20.  grrr.
2011-10-18T14:41:57  <janzert> ChrisH_: resubmissions do not get bumped to the start of the line
2011-10-18T14:42:10  <janzert> first time user submission basically do though
2011-10-18T14:42:35  <ChrisH_> janzert: Really, that's not the externally observable behavior.
2011-10-18T14:42:51  <janzert> so the influx of new users would cause that behavior
2011-10-18T14:42:57  <ChrisH_> janzert: Each time I make a new submission it gets a game within minutes of being compiled.
2011-10-18T14:43:43  <janzert> it would tend to get picked up as an opponent
2011-10-18T14:44:07  <janzert> but not front of the line as a seed
2011-10-18T14:44:18  <ChrisH_> Ok.
2011-10-18T14:44:29  <janzert> which is what people in front of you is looking at
2011-10-18T14:44:56  <amstan> janzert: we should round that number
2011-10-18T14:45:08  <amstan> janzert: since we can't guarantee it's accurate, rigth?
2011-10-18T14:45:13  <janzert> I don't much like the way that number is calculated at all
2011-10-18T14:45:26  <ChrisH_> So why wouldn't a submission with only four games (like mine) get picked up like that too?
2011-10-18T14:45:32  <janzert> I think it tries to get fancy and just makes a mess of it
2011-10-18T14:46:25  <janzert> ChrisH_: I believe it should a little more often, but that very first game will be a large push
2011-10-18T14:46:46  <ChrisH_> It is really frustrating to see sxyuan, summerte, melanye, and mattfedd get game after game, and other get nothing for hours.
2011-10-18T14:46:52  <McLeopold> why do we have 974 users?
2011-10-18T14:47:02  <amstan> McLeopold: good question
2011-10-18T14:47:03  <McLeopold> janzert: can we close signups until launch?
2011-10-18T14:47:14  <janzert> we've been getting a big influx the last few days

2011-10-18T14:47:44  <McLeopold> okay
2011-10-18T14:47:47  <amstan> anyway, i have a lab test, then i'm going home to work on this
2011-10-18T14:48:11  <ChrisH_> janzert: How many workers are planned for after launch? Part of the problem is that with only one worker it just can't keep up with the current rate of new submissions.
2011-10-18T14:48:20  <McLeopold> with so many new submissions, it looks like the 24 hour game count is around zero for everyone?
2011-10-18T14:48:30  <janzert> ChrisH_: undecided, but more ;)
2011-10-18T14:48:36  <ChrisH_> janzert: :)
2011-10-18T14:48:54  <amstan> so how come we have 1/5th of the users from the last contest before it even got launched?
2011-10-18T14:49:16  <janzert> McLeopold: it's all over the place, 100 for (67th) melanye
2011-10-18T14:49:37  <McLeopold> there's got to be a calculation error...
2011-10-18T14:50:03  <janzert> I noticed it varying a bit before the current influx, but the new influx has really exacerbated it

2011-10-18T15:19:59  <McLeopold> amstan: what kind of test?
2011-10-18T15:20:04  <ChrisH_> I understand that there are many reasons why the game scoring the way it is, but it is interesting that in a three player game, the last bot with a remaining hill loses if the other two bots raze each other's hills. It seems counterintuitive.
2011-10-18T15:20:29  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: we want to reward bots that attempt to make progress
2011-10-18T15:20:42  <amstan> McLeopold: design a counter that can count up and down 0,2,4,6
2011-10-18T15:20:46  <amstan> digital logic
2011-10-18T15:20:50  <McLeopold> ah
2011-10-18T15:20:53  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I totally understand.
2011-10-18T15:21:03  <McLeopold> I hope you got 100% on ai-class homework 1 :)
2011-10-18T15:21:33  <amstan> McLeopold: i did
2011-10-18T15:21:48  <mleise> McLeopold: The engine seed in the JSON... I think it cannot be stored that way.
2011-10-18T15:21:58  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: It's just unfortunate that using a few resources (ants) on defense often ends up penalizing a bot because they weren't aggressize enough, even if they were making progress.
2011-10-18T15:22:23  <mleise> All numbers in JavaScript are doubles, so there is not enough precision to store a 64-bit int :p
2011-10-18T15:22:44  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: that assumes that one strategy should be considered "best" and any game mechinic that underminds it is a "penalty"
2011-10-18T15:23:06  <McLeopold> mleise: you are right, we should limit it to something else
2011-10-18T15:23:28  <amstan> mleise: but what's the problem, the idea of the seed is to make it deterministic
2011-10-18T15:23:30  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: true, but the flip side is that not using any ants for defense results in a lost hill and no chance of much progress.
2011-10-18T15:23:47  <amstan> mleise: isn't converting 64bit ints to doubles deterministic?
2011-10-18T15:23:55  <mleise> amstan: yes, you are right
2011-10-18T15:24:07  <McLeopold> ChrisH_: you need a reactive strategy, only explore as far as you can come back for defense, look at what the other bots are doing
2011-10-18T15:24:34  <amstan> mleise: the only problem i can see is different behavoir from implementations
2011-10-18T15:24:35  <mleise> I was just blindly transferring all numbers from the json replay format to the bot input.
2011-10-18T15:24:44  <McLeopold> also, if you keep a constant flow in the hive, you get a lot of ants right at the hill for defense
2011-10-18T15:24:48  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I'm not saying this is hurting me. I have actually benefitted from it many times. Just making a neutral observation.
2011-10-18T15:25:24  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I know that as well. Although that is impossible on low food maps. So it is not always a viable solution.
2011-10-18T15:26:00  <McLeopold> which is the goal of the game, no constant winning strategies :)
2011-10-18T15:26:02  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: My bot's biggest weekness right now is a complete lack of combat tactics. But I still compete in the top 20.

2011-10-18T15:26:33  <McLeopold> I think that will be what wins the competition
2011-10-18T15:27:04  <McLeopold> last year after I posted my bot, every seems to include resource funnelling to the frontier, then if you didn't have it, you couldn't compete
2011-10-18T15:27:12  <ChrisH_> McLeopold: I agree. I'm still thinking through the best way to include it in my code. I think my strategy is good, but still working on tactics.
2011-10-18T15:27:29  <McLeopold> And the winners where the ones that solved other problems besides fast growth and funnelling
2011-10-18T15:28:02  <ChrisH_> yep, I finished #24 and the leap from ~200 to top 25 was dealing with close range starting planets correctly.
2011-10-18T15:28:03  <McLeopold> I think in this competition, you need pathfinding to compete, and battle tactics to win.
2011-10-18T15:28:29  <McLeopold> ouch, you beat me :(, what was your bot name again?
2011-10-18T15:28:33  <ChrisH_> ChrisH
2011-10-18T15:28:35  <_flag> McLeopold: I think one critism that you can make for the current rules is that they don't encourage consistent results. If I have to take a large risk to attack another bot, then it's easy for me to lose outright to a third bot who attacks me. This means there is no "safe" way to play
2011-10-18T15:28:55  <_flag> And even the best bots will lose odd games to inferior players
2011-10-18T15:29:28  <McLeopold> so, no "safe" strategy leads to a fluctuating leaderboard?
2011-10-18T15:29:35  <_flag> Exactly
2011-10-18T15:29:36  <ChrisH_> I would add that in PW, allowing the other bot to spend ships conquering a neutral and then swooping in the next turn was a key differentiator as well.
2011-10-18T15:29:37  <amstan> mleise: do you want a forum account rename?
2011-10-18T15:30:11  <ChrisH_> I agree _flag. It also means it will take a LOT of matches in the finals for things to stabilize.
2011-10-18T15:30:11  <mleise> amstan: I woudn't mind, thank you
2011-10-18T15:30:54  <amstan> mleise: http://ai-contest.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=1233
2011-10-18T15:30:58  <_flag> But that's not necessarily a good thing. If it takes a thousand games to figure out who the best bots really are it may not be good for the contest
2011-10-18T15:31:22  <mleise> amstan: that was quick
2011-10-18T15:31:27  <amstan> McLeopold: aarossig is working at a place that's getting rid of some old comps
2011-10-18T15:31:27  <ChrisH_> I second what _flag just said.
2011-10-18T15:31:40  <amstan> McLeopold: he'll have like 10 1.6Ghz 64 bit comps
2011-10-18T15:31:49  <amstan> McLeopold: what's your toughts of using them for workers?
2011-10-18T15:31:52  <ChrisH_> gotta go
2011-10-18T15:31:56  <McLeopold> hmm...

2011-10-18T15:32:08  <McLeopold> are they all the same?
2011-10-18T15:32:19  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, but they don't match ec2
2011-10-18T15:32:41  <McLeopold> what's the memory?
2011-10-18T15:32:41  <amstan> also, network connection will be limited, not sure how much the workers use
2011-10-18T15:32:44  <amstan> it'll be a dsl line
2011-10-18T15:32:46  <amstan> i think 2GB
2011-10-18T15:32:51  <McLeopold> worker uses very little network
2011-10-18T15:33:02  <amstan> ok, decent
2011-10-18T15:33:33  <McLeopold> you could write a script to launch the worker to download and compile every submission without reporting results
2011-10-18T15:33:42  <McLeopold> that would be a good first test
2011-10-18T15:34:12  <amstan> McLeopold: first thing is if he should work toward getting those comps
2011-10-18T15:34:20  <McLeopold> we need to make sure that bots get 500MB of memory, so that would limit the map size on those boxen
2011-10-18T15:34:21  <amstan> he doesn't want so many if he doesn't have a use for them
2011-10-18T15:34:56  <McLeopold> unless we just lower the amount to 250, but then we are wasting space on ec2
2011-10-18T15:35:09  <McLeopold> are they upgradable?
2011-10-18T15:35:19  <McLeopold> could we get them to 4GB?
2011-10-18T15:35:26  <amstan> probably
2011-10-18T15:35:27  <amstan> but that means cost
2011-10-18T15:35:43  <McLeopold> but if it replaces 1 ec2 worker, it might be worth it
2011-10-18T15:35:50  <amstan> yeah
2011-10-18T15:35:58  <amstan> McLeopold: so i should tell them to work on them then?
2011-10-18T15:36:01  <McLeopold> that's 600 for 2 months, memory is cheap these days
2011-10-18T15:36:34  <McLeopold> the other issue would be that 500ms on an ec2 gets you more instructions than on those machines
2011-10-18T15:37:02  <amstan> i spoke to janzert
2011-10-18T15:37:15  <amstan> he said that he's more concerned about administering them, than cpu differences from ec2
2011-10-18T15:37:29  <amstan> but i volunteer myself, and i'm sure aarosig can do stuff too
2011-10-18T15:37:39  <McLeopold> I wouldn't worry about admin, the workers are very stable
2011-10-18T15:37:48  <amstan> yeah, ok
2011-10-18T15:38:00  <McLeopold> If they are all the same, and they can compile all the bots with no issues, then they are probably ok
2011-10-18T15:38:17  <McLeopold> You just need to ensure power :)
2011-10-18T15:38:23  <amstan> yes
2011-10-18T15:38:36  <amstan> this would be a cool project
2011-10-18T15:38:42  <amstan> can be reused too
2011-10-18T15:40:09  <McLeopold> I would say we don't use them for finals, though
2011-10-18T15:40:17  <amstan> ok
2011-10-18T15:40:52  <McLeopold> Unless they are fast enough that they are all we need
2011-10-18T15:41:19  <amstan> let me get exact quote
2011-10-18T15:42:57  <amstan> "well, this office I am working in is decomissioning 8 dell vostro 200's. they are core2duo, around 2GHz. 2gb of ram. 8 identical machines"
2011-10-18T15:44:32  <McLeopold> are our ec2 instances high-memory or high cpu?
2011-10-18T15:45:24  <amstan> i'm not sure

2011-10-18T16:36:59  <ChrisH_> I think it is harder, especially with a 500ms/turn time limit.
2011-10-18T16:37:01  <Accoun> contest tools for Python 2.7.2 ?
2011-10-18T16:37:03  <RenderMonkey> hehe slin will be a challenge for sure ChrisH_  but i dont think i will be much of a challenge
2011-10-18T16:37:17  <ChrisH_> This game is more compute intensive with all the path finding.
2011-10-18T16:37:17  <RenderMonkey> im a last year under graduate student
2011-10-18T16:37:23  <RenderMonkey> and we suck :p
2011-10-18T16:37:29  <RenderMonkey> yea
2011-10-18T16:37:36  <Accoun> contest tools for Python 2.7.2 ? yes?
2011-10-18T16:38:41  <ChrisH_> RenderMonkey: You might be surprised.
2011-10-18T16:40:56  <RenderMonkey> well in planet wars you could come up with some nice strategy
2011-10-18T16:41:16  <RenderMonkey> that didnt necessarily rely on advance algorithms etc
2011-10-18T16:41:21  <RenderMonkey> i think it will be harder in ants
2011-10-18T16:42:07  <ChrisH_> It is harder, but that doesn't mean strategy isn't part of the game.
2011-10-18T16:42:26  <RenderMonkey> sure
2011-10-18T16:42:45  <RenderMonkey> i think i had a better chance in planet wars tho :P
2011-10-18T16:42:54  <RenderMonkey> but you never know
2011-10-18T16:43:07  <RenderMonkey> i might get hooked on the contest

2011-10-18T16:43:25  <ChrisH_> I think there are more tough decisions to make.  The lack of perfect information adds a big challenge.

2011-10-18T16:47:12  <areece> I had a few questions about Go and the challenge.
2011-10-18T16:47:16  <ChrisH_> RenderMonkey: Learned about the PW competition from a blog last year and got hooked.
2011-10-18T16:47:17  <areece> What version of Go is the server running?
2011-10-18T16:47:24  <ChrisH_> 60.1
2011-10-18T16:47:29  <areece> The starter code doesn't compile on my machine :3
2011-10-18T16:47:29  <RenderMonkey> hehe
2011-10-18T16:47:40  <areece> Let me check what version I'm on
2011-10-18T16:48:01  <areece> Also, in go it is often considered idiomatic to use multiple goroutines.
2011-10-18T16:48:12  <areece> However, the contest rules explicitily forbid multiple threads.
2011-10-18T16:48:17  *** ltriant <ltriant!~ltriant@110-174-168-43.static.tpgi.com.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-18T16:48:27  <ChrisH_> areece: I haven't tried multiple goroutines yet.
2011-10-18T16:48:49  <areece> Is it even allowed?
2011-10-18T16:49:05  <ChrisH_> However, since the competition uses the gc compilers, and they only use one thread by default (and multiplex the goroutines on that thread), it might work ok.
2011-10-18T16:49:19  <ChrisH_> I'm considering it, but so far haven't needed it.
2011-10-18T16:49:36  <areece> Ah, I have go 60.2
2011-10-18T16:49:47  <areece> The image stuff doesn't appear correct.
2011-10-18T16:50:52  <ChrisH_> areece: I wouldn't know about that. I didn't use the go starter kit, but I did help them fix the code that runs the compiler, so I'm a little familiar with how that works.
2011-10-18T16:51:19  <areece> So I just downloaded the starter code and couldn't compile it.
2011-10-18T16:51:41  <ChrisH_> The exact version reported on the website is: 6g version release.r60.1 9753+
2011-10-18T16:52:02  <areece> But I'm also  doing some development in Go, so not am synced to release tree.
2011-10-18T16:52:15  <ChrisH_> Ahhh
2011-10-18T16:52:41  <ChrisH_> I do more work in a VM just for working on ants.

2011-10-18T16:53:15  <ChrisH_> Since go still has issues on Windows and that's what my main machine has. So I have ubuntu in a VM, and that makes it a lot easier.
2011-10-18T16:53:44  <areece> So there is a go version 60.3 out now.
2011-10-18T16:53:45  <areece> http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/.hgtags
2011-10-18T16:55:14  <ChrisH_> Anything interesting, or just bug fixes.
2011-10-18T16:55:51  <areece> Well
2011-10-18T16:56:01  <areece> It appears that the image API changed :P
2011-10-18T16:56:15  <areece> I dunno, I'd have to check.
2011-10-18T16:56:23  <areece> I'm still waiting for Go 1 ^.^
2011-10-18T16:57:02  <ChrisH_> Description from golang-announce: We just tagged release.r60.3, a minor update to the r60 branch.  It fixes a bug in the reflect package.
2011-10-18T16:57:54  <ChrisH_> areece: The image stuff in the starter kit is just there for debugging, so you could just delete that part.
2011-10-18T16:58:18  <ChrisH_> I debug with plain old fmt.Printf() statements myself.
2011-10-18T16:58:40  <areece> I wrote a logging package for mine
2011-10-18T16:58:51  <areece> github.com/awreece/golog
2011-10-18T16:58:58  <ChrisH_> Yeah, I did that too.  :)
2011-10-18T16:59:00  <areece> Still unstable
2011-10-18T16:59:01  <areece> Yeah.

2011-10-18T16:59:33  <areece> anyways, I'd like to report that the go starter code doesn't compile
2011-10-18T16:59:48  <jnwhiteh> areece: what is the compliation error?
2011-10-18T17:00:02  <jnwhiteh> I also don't think it supports the hills, I haven't been able to add them yet
2011-10-18T17:01:03  <ChrisH_> areece: you should keep in mind that the way go gets compiled for the contest that you can't have multiple packages in your code, so you'll need to move your logging stuff in to the main package if you haven't already.
2011-10-18T17:01:30  <areece> you don't goinstall?
2011-10-18T17:03:12  <areece> http://pastebin.com/y8ingWB3
2011-10-18T17:03:17  <ChrisH_> only the packages that are part of the standard library and your main package are available.
2011-10-18T17:04:12  <ChrisH_> so all your *.go files get compiled with a single 6g call and the output is passed to 6l.
2011-10-18T17:04:27  <areece> wait, you don't respect the Makefile?
2011-10-18T17:05:03  <ChrisH_> none of the languages get that in the contest, they use very basic python code to run the compilers, no make, no ant, etc.
2011-10-18T17:05:16  <Accoun> int(self.db.retrieve("select id from games order by id desc limit 1;",())[0][0])
2011-10-18T17:05:21  <ChrisH_> BTW, I just helped them fix a bug, I didn't write it. ;)
2011-10-18T17:05:39  <Accoun> ^ how to make no error if emty select result?
2011-10-18T17:06:16  <areece>  makes me sad. Now I can't do automatic code generation, or testing, or ...
2011-10-18T17:06:47  <ChrisH_> areece: yeah
2011-10-18T17:06:56  <areece> Anyways: jnwhiteh, ChrisH_, http://pastebin.com/y8ingWB3 is my compilation error
2011-10-18T17:07:18  <jnwhiteh> areece: you can just drop debugging.go from the Makefile and it will compile file
2011-10-18T17:07:21  <jnwhiteh> fine
2011-10-18T17:07:29  <jnwhiteh> I didn't implement any of the debugging stuff, so I'm not sure what its all about
2011-10-18T17:07:37  <jnwhiteh> but running gofix on it should work fine =)
2011-10-18T17:07:50  <jnwhiteh> *however* if you do that, it may differ from the server version
2011-10-18T17:08:00  <jnwhiteh> you should try uploading the starter package first to see if it errors at all =)
2011-10-18T17:08:26  <areece> jnwhiteh: Yup, that worked
2011-10-18T17:08:43  <areece> I uploaded the starter package and it built just fine.
2011-10-18T17:08:49  <jnwhiteh> then you have a version difference
2011-10-18T17:08:51  <areece> It doesn't build locally w/o gofix
2011-10-18T17:08:53  <areece> Yes.
2011-10-18T17:09:04  <areece> Solution: I use an old version of Go?
2011-10-18T17:09:08  <jnwhiteh> yep =)
2011-10-18T17:09:11  <areece> :(
2011-10-18T17:09:20  <jnwhiteh> you can have multiple go installations
2011-10-18T17:09:23  <jnwhiteh> quite easily =)
2011-10-18T17:09:24  <areece> :'(
2011-10-18T17:09:37  <ChrisH_> areece: but, the version used in ants isn't going to change during the competition :)
2011-10-18T17:09:52  <areece> ok :-/
2011-10-18T17:09:57  <ChrisH_> so once you start you won't get blindsided by a new release right before finals.
2011-10-18T17:09:58  * areece grumbles: its not like anyone else uses go
2011-10-18T17:09:59  <jnwhiteh> just install a version that you use when working on the competition
2011-10-18T17:10:04  <jnwhiteh> I do
2011-10-18T17:10:09  <jnwhiteh> and its not that big of an issue =)
2011-10-18T17:10:30  <jnwhiteh> at the top of the Makefile, define GOROOT to be the 'alternate' GOROOT
2011-10-18T17:10:53  <ChrisH_> Hey, I'm using go for ants. I wonder whose gobot will place higher.  ;)
2011-10-18T17:10:54  <jnwhiteh> with a conditional so it only runs on your machine
2011-10-18T17:11:02  <jnwhiteh> hehe
2011-10-18T17:11:06  <jnwhiteh> I dont know if I'll be able to compete
2011-10-18T17:11:08  <jnwhiteh> my thesis and all =/
2011-10-18T17:11:19  <jnwhiteh> ChrisH_: does the starter pack now support the hills?
2011-10-18T17:11:20  <Zannick> wow, 3 people who use go in the same place at once
2011-10-18T17:11:22  <Zannick> :o
2011-10-18T17:11:25  <ChrisH_> Yeah, thesis is a bit more important. ;)
2011-10-18T17:11:30  <Zannick> ;)
2011-10-18T17:11:33  <jnwhiteh> there's tons of us in #go-nuts =)
2011-10-18T17:12:02  <ChrisH_> jnwhiteh: I have no idea, I built my code from scratch and haven't looked at the go starter kit for a month.
2011-10-18T17:12:08  <jnwhiteh> :P
2011-10-18T17:13:33  <ChrisH_> I am actually using the ants competition as a playground for learning go. I didn't PW in Java, and thought go would be a better language for this type of code.
2011-10-18T17:13:48  <ChrisH_> that should be "I did PW in Java"
2011-10-18T17:13:59  <areece> Go is fun, but immature.
2011-10-18T17:14:03  <ChrisH_> yes
2011-10-18T17:14:06  <areece> I would not advise Go for any real project.
2011-10-18T17:14:12  <ChrisH_> not yet
2011-10-18T17:14:13  <jnwhiteh> psh
2011-10-18T17:14:15  <Zannick> i did pw in c++ until i got fed up with it, threw out all the c++ and did the rest in c
2011-10-18T17:14:19  <jnwhiteh> plenty of us use it for real projects every day
2011-10-18T17:14:36  <areece> The first time I sat down and used it for a real project I found 2 bugs in the standard library.
2011-10-18T17:14:37  <jnwhiteh> gofix fixes anything that changes without issue 90% of the time
2011-10-18T17:14:37  <ChrisH_> I'm sure.
2011-10-18T17:14:38  <areece> Thats not ok
2011-10-18T17:14:42  <jnwhiteh> and you can target release/weekly/whatever you want
2011-10-18T17:15:11  <Zannick> areece: launch and iterate!
2011-10-18T17:15:16  <ChrisH_> I hope go gains traction because I think it is a pretty neat language.
2011-10-18T17:15:24  <areece> I agree
2011-10-18T17:15:36  <areece> I want my languages to have lamda functions :3
2011-10-18T17:15:53  <ChrisH_> One thing I have found VERY helpful with ants is the profiling tools.

2011-10-18T17:16:59  <ChrisH_> janzert: I have a recommendation for improvement.
2011-10-18T17:17:01  <mleise> D has lamdas and instrumented profiling as well.
2011-10-18T17:17:08  <janzert> mostly McLeopold has but I've done some as well
2011-10-18T17:17:48  <ChrisH_> janzert: I recommend displaying all of the dates and times in the same format. There are currently three different date formats on the same page. Makes it hard to compare them.
2011-10-18T17:17:56  <mleise> But I'd use a heuristical profiler over any instrumented profiler.
2011-10-18T17:18:13  <janzert> ChrisH_: yeah, I think there is even a bug filed about that already too
2011-10-18T17:18:15  <janzert> :(
2011-10-18T17:18:27  <ChrisH_> janzert: I thought I might have filed one, but couldn't find it today.
2011-10-18T17:19:03  <janzert> it's just a matter of someone actually doing it
2011-10-18T17:19:47  <mleise> There are quite a few systems languages emerging that can be an alternative to C/C++.
2011-10-18T17:20:09  <Zannick> i should pick up on the old work i did in zeta

2011-10-18T17:25:44  <Zannick> if there is an ideas thread, i would like to be pointed at it. i've been not working on aichallenge since february or so
2011-10-18T17:25:56  <areece> Um, it means that flags can't be used?
2011-10-18T17:26:24  <Zannick> areece: the command line used to run the bot is fixed.
2011-10-18T17:26:27  <mleise> Zannick: I don't know. But the compiler system could support build systems.

2011-10-18T17:27:54  <Zannick> but make sure that the reasonable defaults of "no flags specified" still work
2011-10-18T17:28:09  <areece> Of course.
2011-10-18T17:28:43  <g0llum> areece, the engine is not passing any cmd line args to aour bot ever
2011-10-18T17:28:45  <Zannick> yeah, as mleise said, you can edit the starter files as much as you like, or start from scratch.
2011-10-18T17:28:58  <areece> Guys, of course I realize I can edit the starter code -.-
2011-10-18T17:29:17  <areece> I was just grumbling that "./binary  --help" didn't produce anything meaningful
2011-10-18T17:29:31  <Zannick> ah, right. the engine. if you want your bot to play with flags specified from the engine, you need to modify the engine
2011-10-18T17:29:41  <amstan> areece: the thing is that you're never supposed to run your bot manually, but run it through the engine
2011-10-18T17:29:49  <Zannick> and starter-specific issues should be taken up with the author ;)

2011-10-18T17:30:17  <amstan> areece: get the tools, the run_one_game
2011-10-18T17:30:32  <amstan> mleise: sure they do: stdin, stdout
2011-10-18T17:31:10  <mleise> amstan: I mean the posix standard for providing --help, -h and other flags.
2011-10-18T17:31:18  <Zannick> is that a posix standard?
2011-10-18T17:31:19  <areece> ... ah
2011-10-18T17:31:38  <amstan> yeah, it's not really a posix standard, just a convention for user friendly commands
2011-10-18T17:31:39  <Zannick> is there a readme or something in the starter pack?
2011-10-18T17:32:24  <mleise> oh sorry, --help is a GNU standard
2011-10-18T17:32:44  <mleise> http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch10s05.html
2011-10-18T17:35:01  <areece> ... am I expected to modify run_one_game to use it?
2011-10-18T17:35:19  <ChrisH_> areece: yes
2011-10-18T17:35:36  <areece> is this all in a README file somewhere that I just didn't get?
2011-10-18T17:35:41  <ChrisH_> areece: or make copies and edit it to run different tests.

2011-10-18T18:17:46  <Zannick> see "using the tools"
2011-10-18T18:18:39  <Zannick> hm, "Using the Tools" page has a wiki link to "Ants Five Minute Quickstart Guide" but that doesn't work on the site, only on the wiki

2011-10-18T18:40:09  <janzert> I meant to do something like server_message.html
2011-10-18T18:40:16  <janzert> but have it included in the head section
2011-10-18T18:40:30  <amstan> and call it what? google_analytics?

2011-10-18T19:34:49  <janzert> McLeopold: Why if I don't and never have had an active submission does my profile page say I have 8 players ahead of me?
2011-10-18T19:35:43  <janzert> screamer__: playgame should open a browser to show the game after playing it
2011-10-18T19:35:49  <McLeopold> janzert: because whoever is writing the webpages sucks

2011-10-18T19:40:37  <screamer__> janzert: yes, it opens. but bot doesn't do any actions. maybe I pass it in a wrong way?
2011-10-18T19:43:19  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, it's later...
2011-10-18T19:43:46  <McLeopold> if you ever did submit a a valid bot, that is how many people would be ahead of you
2011-10-18T19:44:00  <McLeopold> which is technically how many people are currently in matchups

2011-10-18T20:30:29  <janzert> actually just over
2011-10-18T20:30:50  <janzert> 1580000KB
2011-10-18T20:30:57  <McLeopold> they only get 1 core anyway, so, what does 6.5 ec2 compute units really get us?
2011-10-18T20:31:28  <janzert> the 1 core they get is a faster core than the 1 core they get in a m1.large
2011-10-18T20:31:58  <McLeopold> do we only get 2 cores?  or is it unknown?
2011-10-18T20:32:04  <janzert> 2 cores yes
2011-10-18T20:32:07  <janzert> in either type
2011-10-18T20:32:15  <McLeopold> are we running parallel or serial?
2011-10-18T20:32:22  <janzert> 2 bots at a time
2011-10-18T20:32:28  <McLeopold> okay
2011-10-18T20:32:38  <janzert> 1 per core

2011-10-18T21:43:59  * amstan_ waves back
2011-10-18T21:44:56  <rockzombie2> hello?
2011-10-18T21:44:59  <aarossig> rockzombie2: So.. are you a zombie and a rock at the same time? or are you a zombie who likes listening to rock music?
2011-10-18T21:45:12  <aarossig> hey, how are you :D
2011-10-18T21:45:32  <rockzombie2> it's more of an open-to-interpretation type thing
2011-10-18T21:45:45  <rockzombie2> it kinda just evolved from previous usernames
2011-10-18T21:45:49  <aarossig> ah okay -- so what brings you to the channel?
2011-10-18T21:46:08  <rockzombie2> so i'm a little confused about the AI challenge
2011-10-18T21:46:25  <rockzombie2> first of all, is it not open yet, or is it already closed? the Ant one?
2011-10-18T21:46:37  <aarossig> it has yet to open
2011-10-18T21:46:48  <aarossig> it opens in about a week or so
2011-10-18T21:47:25  <aarossig> New Video Everyone: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPs1y8LkMOo
2011-10-18T21:47:27  <rockzombie2> oh, ok. Well I still downloaded the packages and stuff to test it out but it didn't work. I don't know if its because it hasn't opened yet or if its because of an entirely different problem
2011-10-18T21:48:00  <aarossig> rockzombie2: well, I believe registration has been disabled because we are still in beta
2011-10-18T21:48:17  <aarossig> the problem has changed slightly because we were in open beta for such a long time
2011-10-18T21:48:34  <amstan_> rockzombie2: we'll launch very soon(2 days)
2011-10-18T21:48:43  <aarossig> I suggest coming back then :)

2011-10-18T21:49:11  <rockzombie2> So no chance of practicing on my computer until then? Like I can't run a game without uploading it first?
2011-10-18T21:49:15  <aarossig> when we launch we will all be around to help new comers and old users adapt to the changes
2011-10-18T21:49:42  <amstan_> rockzombie2: check this page out http://aichallenge.org/using_the_tools.php
2011-10-18T21:50:47  <rockzombie2> yeah, see that's what I tried doing, (running play_one_game.cmd) and I got an error saying something about 'python is not a valid command'
2011-10-18T21:51:16  <amstan_> rockzombie2: you need to install python
2011-10-18T21:51:41  <rockzombie2> well then. that sounds simple enough. I'll go try that now
2011-10-18T21:52:07  <amstan_> rockzombie2: ping me if you need help
2011-10-18T21:54:11  <rockzombie2> does it matter which version of Python I download?
2011-10-18T21:54:36  <rockzombie2> 3.2.2 or 2.7.2?

2011-10-18T23:09:22  <amstan> mohawk college?
2011-10-18T23:11:04  <janzert> amstan: any ideas for a @aichallenge.org email address? I'm thinking maybe something like staff@ that would go to a list the admins could subscribe to
2011-10-18T23:11:30  <amstan> yes
2011-10-18T23:11:33  <amstan> good idea
2011-10-18T23:11:36  <janzert> right now registration emails go out with a from address of janzert@janzert.com changing that to an @aichallenge.org address would be nice
2011-10-18T23:11:47  <amstan> we have noreply@ai-contest.com already
2011-10-18T23:11:53  <amstan> for that
2011-10-18T23:11:58  <amstan> but aichallenge.org works too
2011-10-18T23:12:00  <janzert> is that a real address though?
2011-10-18T23:12:03  <amstan> yes
2011-10-18T23:12:07  <amstan> it's a real inbox too
2011-10-18T23:12:11  <janzert> oh
2011-10-18T23:12:27  <janzert> then I just need to get it verified with amazon's email server
2011-10-18T23:12:33  <janzert> service
2011-10-18T23:12:48  <janzert> is someone monitoring it?
2011-10-18T23:12:56  <amstan> jeff set it all up
2011-10-18T23:13:04  <janzert> I have gotten a few questions back in reply to registration emails
2011-10-18T23:13:30  <amstan> jeff didn't want to read them
2011-10-18T23:13:44  <janzert> :}
2011-10-18T23:14:22  <janzert> I think it will stay fairly low volume
2011-10-18T23:14:46  <janzert> i.e. I don't mind handling them, just need an account/address to do it with
2011-10-18T23:16:55  <janzert> I do think having it as a list we all could monitor is probably the best option though
