2011-05-05T01:59:59  <antimatroid> i had class at 9 :(
2011-05-05T02:00:06  <JaycobColeman> Calculus done!
2011-05-05T02:00:40  <JaycobColeman> for high school anyway
2011-05-05T02:00:44  <mcstar> whats next? probability theory?
2011-05-05T02:01:07  <antimatroid> who?
2011-05-05T02:01:10  <mcstar> ah high school
2011-05-05T02:01:15  <antimatroid> oh
2011-05-05T02:01:24  <antimatroid> i need to learn probability properly some time
2011-05-05T02:01:31  <antimatroid> but i still don't understand measure theory very well
2011-05-05T02:01:49  <mcstar> theres nothing to understand lol
2011-05-05T02:02:03  <JaycobColeman> I don't really know where there is to go after this. I know there are many places, I just don't know what they are
2011-05-05T02:02:09  <antimatroid> sigma algebras hurt my brain

2011-05-05T02:03:25  <mcstar> last night i tried to explain quantum computing to my mom
2011-05-05T02:03:34  <mcstar> i dont think she understands
2011-05-05T02:03:54  <JaycobColeman> probably not

2011-05-05T02:04:09  <mcstar> probably because i dont either :D
2011-05-05T02:04:16  <antimatroid> i made a correction on wikipedia yesterday :P
2011-05-05T02:04:29  <mcstar> what topic?
2011-05-05T02:04:39  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_game
2011-05-05T02:04:48  <antimatroid> the function in the general case was wrong
2011-05-05T02:04:55  <mcstar> you and your symmetries .....
2011-05-05T02:04:57  <mcstar> :D
2011-05-05T02:05:12  <antimatroid> it had u_i(...) = u_pi(i )(a_pi(1 ),...)
2011-05-05T02:05:18  <antimatroid> but it needed pi^-1 in the brackets
2011-05-05T02:05:29  <antimatroid> otherwise it's wrong for n>2 players
2011-05-05T02:05:59  <antimatroid> i'm actually not sure if people just always define it wrong or that was an error
2011-05-05T02:06:10  <antimatroid> i can't find anywhere else that defines symmetry and even that page doesn't do it properly
2011-05-05T02:06:13  <antimatroid> peasants
2011-05-05T02:06:43  <JaycobColeman> muggles
2011-05-05T02:06:50  <antimatroid> yes!
2011-05-05T02:06:53  <antimatroid> best insult
2011-05-05T02:06:55  <mcstar> by this definition the coin tossing example is symmetric
2011-05-05T02:07:01  <antimatroid> no it's not
2011-05-05T02:07:19  <McLeopold> Is sigh around?
2011-05-05T02:07:24  <antimatroid> even once you throw in permutations of strategies you can't make matching pennies symmetric
2011-05-05T02:07:30  <antimatroid> the game simply is not symmetric
2011-05-05T02:07:37  <antimatroid> which begs the question, what makes a game fair?
2011-05-05T02:07:45  <antimatroid> as that game obviously is
2011-05-05T02:08:31  <mcstar> alright
2011-05-05T02:08:43  <mcstar> i will look into this to satisfy my curiosity
2011-05-05T02:09:01  <mcstar> then when im educated i will come back to you with the result :)
2011-05-05T02:09:18  <McLeopold> Is there a non-math explanation of a symmetric game?
2011-05-05T02:09:20  <antimatroid> i am going to type up my example in latex in a bit
2011-05-05T02:09:22  <antimatroid> i will link you
2011-05-05T02:09:29  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-05T02:09:45  <antimatroid> McLeopold: http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/games/SymmetricGame.html
2011-05-05T02:09:54  <antimatroid> that does a very non-general definition for 2 player games
2011-05-05T02:10:14  <antimatroid> basically, if you have A and B as the players payoff matrices, A = transpose(B) then you can say the game is symmetric
2011-05-05T02:10:30  <antimatroid> but if that isn't the case, it's not sufficient information to say the game is not symmetric
2011-05-05T02:11:01  <JaycobColeman> McLeopold: You should also look through my pull request. Getting rid of r lines, updating python sample bots...basically.
2011-05-05T02:11:02  * antimatroid starts typing up the example
2011-05-05T02:11:11  <JaycobColeman> And by you should I mean I'd like you to
2011-05-05T02:11:30  <McLeopold> JaycobColeman: I'm getting there, but could it be easier to just roll back to before I asked you to do stuff?
2011-05-05T02:11:47  <JaycobColeman> sure
2011-05-05T02:12:08  <JaycobColeman> Except that the sample business is still way behind
2011-05-05T02:12:32  <McLeopold> Well, I don't think I want bhasker's additions in the starter pack
2011-05-05T02:12:33  <JaycobColeman> It'd be nice for the function usage to be consistent
2011-05-05T02:13:00  <JaycobColeman> what do you mean? what additions?
2011-05-05T02:13:04  <McLeopold> hmm, for row/col tuples everywhere? yes, we should get that fixed
2011-05-05T02:13:10  <McLeopold> closest_food/ant
2011-05-05T02:13:14  <JaycobColeman> I changed it in all the bots
2011-05-05T02:13:24  <JaycobColeman> oh yes, well that's only in the sample bots
2011-05-05T02:13:32  <JaycobColeman> It really should be in the bot itself
2011-05-05T02:13:38  <JaycobColeman> which is easy enough to take care of
2011-05-05T02:14:03  <McLeopold> it makes sense to put it in the ants class, but it is giving too much away to the programmers
2011-05-05T02:14:12  <McLeopold> the starter packs shouldn't be too smart
2011-05-05T02:14:43  <McLeopold> the python guys will just copy/paste anyway, but all the starter packs need to be consistant
2011-05-05T02:14:55  <JaycobColeman> I agree. If you want to revert all that stuff back to before 'r' lines then I can make all the additions to get it back up to date
2011-05-05T02:15:15  <McLeopold> okay, that would be helpfull
2011-05-05T02:15:19  <JaycobColeman> and move those functions into GreedyBot if that's where you'd like them
2011-05-05T02:15:32  <JaycobColeman> Or do you not want them at all?
2011-05-05T02:15:33  <McLeopold> no, they are fine where they are, sample bots only
2011-05-05T02:15:57  <JaycobColeman> oh okay, yeah I don't believe I added them to starters? That'd be weird of me
2011-05-05T02:17:01  <JaycobColeman> If you revert it I can take care of that...tommorow? probably. I have an AP lit. test to deal with
2011-05-05T02:17:33  <McLeopold> sure, none of this is high priority until after beta
2011-05-05T02:17:42  <JaycobColeman> mkay
2011-05-05T02:18:21  <JaycobColeman> I probably won't be too much use for beta-ey issues, so I can dink around with these things in my free time
2011-05-05T02:18:25  <McLeopold> antimatroid: how is coin-tossing not symmetric?
2011-05-05T02:18:57  <antimatroid> McLeopold: atm i am defining symmetry as a game which remains unchanged from any permutation of the players
2011-05-05T02:19:04  <antimatroid> possibly with a re-arrangement of the players strategies
2011-05-05T02:19:15  <antimatroid> you cannot do that with matching pennies
2011-05-05T02:19:20  <antimatroid> the game is fair, but not symmetric
2011-05-05T02:19:36  <antimatroid> there is also a proof to say that every symmetric 2x2 game has a pure strategy nash equilibria
2011-05-05T02:19:41  <antimatroid> matching pennies does not have one

2011-05-05T03:05:08  <antimatroid> mcstar: the game simply isn't symmetric :P
2011-05-05T03:05:18  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-05T03:05:22  <antimatroid> but it's obviously fair
2011-05-05T03:05:27  <antimatroid> so what defines fairness?
2011-05-05T03:05:46  <mcstar> the expected payoff?
2011-05-05T03:05:56  <antimatroid> i don't think it's that easy
2011-05-05T03:06:10  <mcstar> they will follow 50/50 strategy
2011-05-05T03:06:19  <mcstar> and the expectations will be the same
2011-05-05T03:06:23  <mcstar> but i will read more
2011-05-05T03:06:42  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm pretty sure you could come up with an unfair game that had equal expected utilities with equi-prortional mixed strategies
2011-05-05T03:07:11  <antimatroid> i'm almost done typing up the example
2011-05-05T03:07:15  <antimatroid> it's a bit messy :P
2011-05-05T03:07:25  <antimatroid> 2 player is fairly trivial, so i've done a 2x2x2 game

2011-05-05T03:51:19  <antimatroid> although i've read one uses "we" for mathematics because unlike most scientific experiments, the reader has everything available to them that you do
2011-05-05T03:51:26  <antimatroid> so it's something you do with the reader in a way
2011-05-05T03:52:19  <JaycobColeman> second is where you say "You did this, you do that"
2011-05-05T03:52:22  <JaycobColeman> whatever
2011-05-05T03:52:35  <JaycobColeman> third is referring to someone outside the conversation

2011-05-05T03:53:05  <JaycobColeman> I'm no English major
2011-05-05T03:55:04  <mcstar> antimatroid: i read the wiki page that you corrected and i think you made a mistake
2011-05-05T03:55:14  <antimatroid> with formatting -1?
2011-05-05T03:55:19  <antimatroid> yeah i know :P
2011-05-05T03:55:24  <JaycobColeman> animatroid doesn't make mistakes
2011-05-05T03:55:31  <JaycobColeman> You must be mistaken
2011-05-05T03:55:32  <mcstar> you dont have to take the inverse of the permutation
2011-05-05T03:55:36  <antimatroid> yes you do
2011-05-05T03:55:39  <mcstar> no
2011-05-05T03:55:41  <antimatroid> yes
2011-05-05T03:55:46  <mcstar> it was correct the first time
2011-05-05T03:55:49  <antimatroid> no it wasn't
2011-05-05T03:55:53  <mcstar> yes :)
2011-05-05T03:55:55  <antimatroid> i can break it doing it that way
2011-05-05T03:56:05  <mcstar> listen
2011-05-05T03:56:16  <antimatroid> hold on, i'll add a broken example to the document
2011-05-05T03:56:41  <mcstar> the formula that is written down, tries to linearly write down the transponation for tensors
2011-05-05T03:56:51  <mcstar> stay with me antimatroid
2011-05-05T03:57:09  <mcstar> you here?
2011-05-05T03:57:15  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-05-05T03:57:21  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-05T03:57:33  <mcstar> so when you are beyonf 2-rank tensors
2011-05-05T03:57:53  <mcstar> you can trnaspose tensors many different ways
2011-05-05T03:58:00  <mcstar> thats what the permutation is for
2011-05-05T03:58:36  <mcstar> the theory says, that the game is symmetric, if for any and all such tranpositions the formula gives the same result
2011-05-05T03:58:48  <antimatroid> which is doesn't
2011-05-05T03:59:02  <antimatroid> if you do the example using pi, it breaks
2011-05-05T03:59:07  <mcstar> to see that you dont have to take the inverse of the permutation u just have to consider the diagonal
2011-05-05T03:59:25  <mcstar> which is unchaged, and this only can be achived if you permute correctly
2011-05-05T03:59:42  <mcstar> Pi(a)!=Pi(a)^-1
2011-05-05T03:59:46  <mcstar> for a permutation
2011-05-05T03:59:56  <mcstar> only for a 2 element set
2011-05-05T04:00:09  <antimatroid> you get 4 = u_1(a2,b1,c1) = u_2(t21(b1),t32(c1),t13(a2)) = u_2(a2,b2,c2) = 5
2011-05-05T04:00:38  <mcstar> what are these numbers?
2011-05-05T04:00:47  <antimatroid> have you looked on my last slide?
2011-05-05T04:00:52  <mcstar> no
2011-05-05T04:00:58  <antimatroid> the bottom calculation does an example calculation like tht
2011-05-05T04:01:00  <mcstar> ill eat first
2011-05-05T04:01:02  <antimatroid> this is doing it your way
2011-05-05T04:01:39  <antimatroid> i am pretty damn sure i'm right :P
2011-05-05T04:01:52  <antimatroid> considering i can come up with examples breaking it the old way and not the way i deduced
2011-05-05T04:02:45  <antimatroid> bear in mind the permutation of players is (1,2,3)
2011-05-05T04:03:11  <antimatroid> the only knowledge i have of tensors i've deduced myself though :P
2011-05-05T04:03:25  <mcstar> ill get back to in an hour

2011-05-05T07:30:19  <mcstar> sorry
2011-05-05T07:31:15  <mcstar> first of all i think your second utility matrix is wrong, i cant get it from the first one
2011-05-05T07:31:19  <mcstar> by permutations
2011-05-05T07:31:25  <mcstar> the third is ok though
2011-05-05T07:32:01  <antimatroid> what?
2011-05-05T07:32:25  <mcstar> the second to last slide
2011-05-05T07:32:48  <antimatroid> if you rotate the players in the 3 player game, you need to consider a1 == b2 == c1 and a2 == b1 == c2
2011-05-05T07:32:53  <mcstar> you represent 3 utility matrices in two tables
2011-05-05T07:32:59  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-05-05T07:33:11  <mcstar> so, if i take the first matrix
2011-05-05T07:33:19  <mcstar> ant get all of its transpositions
2011-05-05T07:33:27  <mcstar> then the C matrix is among them
2011-05-05T07:33:30  <mcstar> but the B isnt
2011-05-05T07:33:35  <antimatroid> the first matrix is when player 3 plays c1
2011-05-05T07:33:42  <antimatroid> the second matrix is when player 3 plays c2
2011-05-05T07:33:45  <antimatroid> it's a 2x2x2 cube
2011-05-05T07:33:49  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-05T07:34:09  <mcstar> do you by any chance have mathematica?
2011-05-05T07:34:14  <antimatroid> no
2011-05-05T07:34:34  <mcstar> let me see what python offers then
2011-05-05T07:35:16  <antimatroid> relabel the game with player 2 on the rows with b2 first and b1 second, then player 1 along the columns with a2 first and a1 second
2011-05-05T07:35:33  <antimatroid> then write out the new game, re-arranging to put player 2's payoff first
2011-05-05T07:35:37  <antimatroid> then look at the game you get
2011-05-05T07:35:39  <antimatroid> it's the same

2011-05-05T07:38:48  <antimatroid> imgur :P
2011-05-05T07:39:16  <antimatroid> can you do what i said above though?
2011-05-05T07:39:27  <mcstar> a moment
2011-05-05T07:39:35  <antimatroid> you should be able to convince yourself after doing the firstt matrix
2011-05-05T07:39:38  <mcstar> meanwhile get that pic
2011-05-05T07:40:25  <mcstar> what i sent you is all the permutations of the matrix A
2011-05-05T07:40:41  <antimatroid> trying to find the damn file :P
2011-05-05T07:40:48  <mcstar> hehe
2011-05-05T07:41:13  <mcstar> so u get A from your 2 tables if you translate them onto each other
2011-05-05T07:41:18  <mcstar> you get what i mean?
2011-05-05T07:41:45  <mcstar> the c1,c2 dimension is the innermost column in the picture
2011-05-05T07:42:50  <antimatroid> i'll play with that picture
2011-05-05T07:42:59  <antimatroid> but you have to do what i said above and see that the game stays the same
2011-05-05T07:43:06  <antimatroid> :p
2011-05-05T07:45:08  <antimatroid> mcstar: the problem with the translation from the first tensor to the second is you aren't swapping both player 1 and 2's strategies
2011-05-05T07:45:53  <antimatroid> it should go (2 1 5 2; 4 3 6 4) -> (2 1 5 2; 4 3 6 4) as you might expect :P
2011-05-05T07:46:23  <antimatroid> ergh, hang on
2011-05-05T07:46:28  <antimatroid> i was looking at the players the wrong way
2011-05-05T07:48:31  <antimatroid> same problem, from the first to second tensor in your image, you are permutting players 2 and 3 from row and col positions, but you aren't swapping the "strategies" around
2011-05-05T07:48:36  <antimatroid> which is required
2011-05-05T07:50:10  <antimatroid> swapping both players strategies is equivalent to a horizontal.vertical flip of each inner matrix, which is the transpose, which gives symmetry
2011-05-05T07:50:45  <antimatroid> as i'm saying the game needs to only be invariant under all permutations for some matching up of strategies
2011-05-05T07:50:57  <antimatroid> all permutations of players*
2011-05-05T07:52:51  <antimatroid> mcstar: you still here? :P
2011-05-05T07:52:57  <mcstar> yep
2011-05-05T07:53:04  <antimatroid> have i convinced you yet?
2011-05-05T07:53:09  <antimatroid> at least that the game is symmetric
2011-05-05T07:53:49  <mcstar> well im not sure about anything
2011-05-05T07:54:27  <antimatroid> did you write out the game with player 2 as row with (b2, b1), player 1 as col with (a2, a1) and player 3 as page with (c1, c2)?
2011-05-05T07:55:07  <antimatroid> with payoffs ordered for 2, 1, 3, you get the exact same game
2011-05-05T07:55:19  <mcstar> i think symmetry here means that in a simple situation(not mixed strategies) only the transpositional equivalence is required from the utility matrices
2011-05-05T07:55:47  <antimatroid> is this game symmetric...
2011-05-05T07:55:47  <antimatroid> 1,4 2,2
2011-05-05T07:55:47  <antimatroid> 3,3 4,1?
2011-05-05T07:56:16  <antimatroid> it is if you pair a1,b2 and a2,b1
2011-05-05T07:56:21  <mcstar> no
2011-05-05T07:56:46  <antimatroid> swap player 2's strategies and you get
2011-05-05T07:56:47  <antimatroid> 2,2 1,4
2011-05-05T07:56:47  <antimatroid> 4,1 3,3
2011-05-05T07:57:01  <antimatroid> that is symmetric and equivalent even for mixed strategies keeping strategy labels
2011-05-05T07:57:23  <antimatroid> i want the game to be invariant under some ordering or players strategies
2011-05-05T07:57:31  <antimatroid> not necessarily the current ordering
2011-05-05T07:57:50  <mcstar> so you swap player labels and decision labels too
2011-05-05T07:58:11  <antimatroid> take my 3 player game, then swap b1 with b2
2011-05-05T07:58:18  <antimatroid> i just did that without swapping the names
2011-05-05T07:58:24  <antimatroid> from a very basic symmetric game
2011-05-05T07:58:51  <antimatroid> i wanted to illustrate the point that the ordering of strategy sets shouldn't matter
2011-05-05T07:59:11  <mcstar> yeah, well i think it should

2011-05-05T07:59:53  <mcstar> im not sure otherwise how could asymmetry exist
2011-05-05T07:59:56  <antimatroid> can you run your script again after swapping b1 and b2?
2011-05-05T08:00:16  <antimatroid> assymetry exists if you can't unravel the tensor to meet my conditions
2011-05-05T08:00:23  <antimatroid> asymmetry*
2011-05-05T08:00:45  <antimatroid> although i haven't covered linear transformations of matrices yet
2011-05-05T08:01:06  <antimatroid> consider the two player game as (A, B), then A = B^T, but if you take (A, 2B), the game is structurally the same
2011-05-05T08:01:16  <antimatroid> but that's not as exciting to me, i'll handle that formality later

2011-05-05T08:03:13  <mcstar> aaah
2011-05-05T08:03:17  <mcstar> hm
2011-05-05T08:03:20  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-05-05T08:03:27  <mcstar> structurally the same???
2011-05-05T08:03:34  <mcstar> what does it even mean?
2011-05-05T08:03:56  <mcstar> 2B is totally different utility matrix, i beleive it can change many things
2011-05-05T08:04:06  <antimatroid> depends on how strict you want to be, you might want to maintain the set of pure strategy nash equilibria, mixed strategy nash equilibria or the best response functions
2011-05-05T08:04:30  <mcstar> so symmetry depend on what youre after
2011-05-05T08:04:33  <mcstar> s
2011-05-05T08:04:39  <antimatroid> but in this case don't confess still always dominates for both players
2011-05-05T08:04:48  <antimatroid> it's structurally the same under almost any definition you take
2011-05-05T08:05:12  <antimatroid> i take symmetry to mean the game is invariant for any permutation of the players for some ordering of each players strategies
2011-05-05T08:05:18  <antimatroid> i have developed my definition around that
2011-05-05T08:05:34  <mcstar> what dou you mean "i take symmetry..:"?
2011-05-05T08:05:35  <antimatroid> ergh, confess* always dominates :P
2011-05-05T08:05:41  <mcstar> isnt that given?
2011-05-05T08:05:49  <antimatroid> what do you mean isn't that given?

2011-05-05T08:06:46  <mcstar> did you talk about this with a mathematician friend of yours?

2011-05-05T08:07:15  <antimatroid> i have a physics lecturer looking over it waiting to chat to about it
2011-05-05T08:07:26  <antimatroid> a friend who is smarter than i has semi been told and follows

2011-05-05T08:08:21  <antimatroid> but i have explained the process to him, and he and i set the game theory library up together (although he hasn't worked on it for 2 years)

2011-05-05T15:05:37  <McLeopold> amstan: any experience with the visualizer in the website?
2011-05-05T15:06:32  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah..
2011-05-05T15:07:22  <McLeopold> so, in the repo, we have visualizer/data/img, but the code expects visualizer/img when getting resources off the web
2011-05-05T15:07:47  <McLeopold> It doesn't look too friendly for local testing
2011-05-05T15:10:48  <amstan> McLeopold: how are you putting the visualizer on the web?
2011-05-05T15:10:51  <amstan> it works pretty well for me
2011-05-05T15:10:59  <amstan> http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/website/
2011-05-05T15:12:11  <McLeopold> amstan: I'm not, so my question is, is there a script or something I should run to do the setup?

2011-05-05T15:12:32  <amstan> yes.. see the Setup visualizer point
2011-05-05T15:12:53  <McLeopold> that link gave me a unicorn O_o
2011-05-05T15:13:15  <amstan> well
2011-05-05T15:13:21  <amstan> did i just crash github?
2011-05-05T15:13:23  <amstan> lol
2011-05-05T15:13:29  <amstan> McLeopold: see /INSTALL.md
2011-05-05T15:13:31  <amstan> same file
2011-05-05T15:14:27  <McLeopold> okay, but it seems that if one pulls the repo, they should be able to point apache at website and have things just work
2011-05-05T15:14:42  * amstan thinks that unicorn is so colourfull that nyancorn would be pretty popular
2011-05-05T15:15:09  <amstan> McLeopold: the java visualizer has to be compiled, the javascript minimized and so on
2011-05-05T15:15:31  <amstan> such things shouldn't be in the repo
2011-05-05T15:15:46  <amstan> yay.. it's back
2011-05-05T15:18:28  <McLeopold> the java visualizer is just a work around for IE, I don't like that it's taking over the build process
2011-05-05T15:18:56  <McLeopold> I shouldn't need ant to get a server going
2011-05-05T15:19:38  <amstan> the javascript still has to be minified
2011-05-05T15:20:51  <amstan> McLeopold: if you really can't get ant, download everything from here: http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/website/visualizer/

2011-05-05T18:13:04  <Frontier> yeah, I liked the idea from the start :p
2011-05-05T18:13:56  <Frontier> only for the visualizer though. i don't know if the make files for the rest of the project run on windows or mac.

2011-05-05T21:12:11  <hacklash>  i'm going to switch when the site goes live for the new contest
2011-05-05T21:12:22  <hacklash> is it a big problem in the meantime?

2011-05-05T21:12:54  <hacklash> because i can change it
2011-05-05T21:12:59  <amstan> and you can embed the visualizer in pages

2011-05-05T21:14:24  <amstan> McLeopold: what about it?
2011-05-05T21:14:39  <amstan> McLeopold: what we need is an archive.ai-contest.com
2011-05-05T21:14:45  <McLeopold> for permenant links to replays and such
2011-05-05T21:15:27  <McLeopold> ai-contest.com could just forward to the current contest
2011-05-05T21:15:41  <amstan> McLeopold: that would be interesting
2011-05-05T21:15:57  <McLeopold> yeah, then that is automattic archiving for you
2011-05-05T21:18:04  <McLeopold> amstan: then we could keep a single login/user and they could access all contests
2011-05-05T21:18:56  <McLeopold> I'd like to tag the replays with ants.ai-contest.com right now, which is why I'm suggesting it even though we are a ways off yet
2011-05-05T21:19:20  <amstan> i like the idea of subdomains for each contest
2011-05-05T21:19:33  <McLeopold> okay, I'll assume we will get one then
2011-05-05T21:19:33  <amstan> but.. idk if it's a good idea to just use "ants"
2011-05-05T21:19:38  <amstan> we might get more than one ants contest

2011-05-05T21:24:01  <amstan> i noticed
2011-05-05T21:24:12  <McLeopold> actually the matchmaking is close, look at epsilon-io
2011-05-05T21:24:26  <amstan> matchmaking/rankings/trueskill
2011-05-05T21:24:31  <McLeopold> the website needs some work, the ranking will take longer than I thought
2011-05-05T21:24:40  <McLeopold> the sql needs to be re-written
2011-05-05T21:24:45  <amstan> well.. yes..
2011-05-05T21:25:09  <McLeopold> I had to do a lot to the worker/engine/playgame stuff to get it all to work together
2011-05-05T21:25:16  <McLeopold> but it is looking nice now
2011-05-05T21:26:05  <amstan> McLeopold: also, what's going on with the r lines?
2011-05-05T21:26:08  <amstan> do we still have them?
2011-05-05T21:26:12  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-05T21:26:15  <amstan> ok
2011-05-05T21:26:31  <McLeopold> too complicated, even though they were useful
2011-05-05T21:26:43  <amstan> ok
2011-05-05T21:26:56  <amstan> what else is to be done besides the matchmaking/rankings/trueskill?
2011-05-05T21:27:05  <amstan> will the contest work after that?
2011-05-05T21:28:44  <McLeopold> it will mostly work

2011-05-05T21:42:05  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon-io/sql/2_generate_matchup.sql
2011-05-05T21:44:10  <amstan> where is that generate_matchup procedure stored?
2011-05-05T21:44:18  <McLeopold> look up
2011-05-05T21:44:25  <McLeopold> oh
2011-05-05T21:44:27  <McLeopold> in mysql
2011-05-05T21:44:31  <amstan> oh..
2011-05-05T21:44:32  <amstan> i see
2011-05-05T21:47:06  <amstan> McLeopold: hmm.. ok.. so the procedure is moved to the sql database when you populate it

2011-05-05T21:47:14  <amstan> McLeopold: and then php calls it
2011-05-05T21:48:22  <McLeopold> yep
2011-05-05T21:48:42  <McLeopold> any language or too can call it, then a matchup record magically appears
2011-05-05T21:48:47  <McLeopold> *tool*
2011-05-05T21:49:02  <amstan> and the issue that you're having is that it doesn't work?
2011-05-05T21:49:12  <McLeopold> it doesn't actually execute
2011-05-05T21:49:24  <amstan> did you load it in the mysql?
2011-05-05T21:49:26  <McLeopold> if I use mysql_query
2011-05-05T21:49:31  <McLeopold> ?
2011-05-05T21:49:44  <McLeopold> like, did I test it directly in the database?
2011-05-05T21:49:48  <amstan> yeah
2011-05-05T21:49:53  <McLeopold> yes
2011-05-05T21:50:07  <Pumpkin> Is there any possible max view_radius^2  ( top limit ) ??
2011-05-05T21:50:08  <McLeopold> I can call it from mysql and it runs, but not from the php page
2011-05-05T21:50:17  <McLeopold> 96, probably
2011-05-05T21:50:26  <McLeopold> we are going to try 55 to start with
2011-05-05T21:50:51  <amstan> McLeopold: what about phpmyadmin? if that works, other php pages should work
2011-05-05T21:52:10  <McLeopold> probably, but this is to the point where it is a waste of my effort
2011-05-05T21:52:24  <Pumpkin> 96 is sure , or if no what's the rought top limit ?
2011-05-05T21:52:27  <McLeopold> the sp works on its on, we need an expert to just get it called correctly
2011-05-05T21:52:41  <amstan> McLeopold: well.. i could test it locally and fiddle with it until it works, but idk how to setup the test enviroment
2011-05-05T21:53:36  <McLeopold> switching to mysqli might do the trick , but that's a lot of work

2011-05-05T21:56:13  <amstan> McLeopold: ic.. mysqli seems to be based on classes, and mysql is just a bunch of global functions
2011-05-05T21:56:14  <amstan> fun.. lol
2011-05-05T21:56:35  <McLeopold> but mysqli can do the store procedure call
2011-05-05T21:56:50  <McLeopold> plus you can use it in a procedural style if wanted
2011-05-05T21:57:03  <amstan> what about just using mysqli for the procedural call?
2011-05-05T21:57:12  <McLeopold> that's my work around :)
2011-05-05T21:57:24  <amstan> is that not good enough then?
2011-05-05T21:57:26  <McLeopold> but like I said, then the api calls return odd results sometimes
2011-05-05T21:57:33  <amstan> oh..
2011-05-05T21:57:42  <amstan> odd as in what?
2011-05-05T21:57:43  <McLeopold> it's like the connection get stuck or something
2011-05-05T21:58:04  <McLeopold> I run the sql to get the next task on the database directly and it gives me something
2011-05-05T21:58:12  <McLeopold> but the api_get_task can never find it
2011-05-05T21:58:28  <antimatroid> amstan: who is that? :P
2011-05-05T21:58:30  <McLeopold> I'm pulling the sql from the api_logs, so I know I'm running the same thing
2011-05-05T21:58:33  <amstan> McLeopold: it's probably because your other mysql connection is still open
2011-05-05T21:58:48  <amstan> antimatroid: hacklash
2011-05-05T22:00:23  <McLeopold> amstan: maybe, but I can't controll it
2011-05-05T22:00:30  <hacklash> amstan: you called?
2011-05-05T22:00:41  <McLeopold> I read somewhere that I might need to use mysql_kill, but I haven't tried yet
2011-05-05T22:00:41  <amstan> McLeopold: so.. you open the normal mysql, possibly do a query, then you open a mysqli, do the procedure, close mysqli, then the original mysql connection might get stuck because of that
2011-05-05T22:00:50  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-05T22:00:58  <McLeopold> the regular one is suppose to be persistant
2011-05-05T22:01:04  <amstan> hacklash: nope, just telling antimatroid about your blog post
2011-05-05T22:01:16  <hacklash> oh, ok
2011-05-05T22:03:48  <amstan> fucking sshfs! ALWAYS crashes after suspend
2011-05-05T22:04:34  <jbroman> Because you lost your SSH connection, presumably.
2011-05-05T22:04:46  <jbroman> (Hypothesis, anyhow.)
2011-05-05T22:05:32  <amstan> jbroman: it even crashes bash when i try to tab complete the mount point
2011-05-05T22:05:46  <jbroman> :/
2011-05-05T22:07:41  <amstan> i should look at using something more stable
2011-05-05T22:15:57  <McLeopold> amstan: look at https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon-io/reset_server.cmd and translate to a bash script
2011-05-05T22:16:33  <McLeopold> it's how I setup a few users to start testing the workers
2011-05-05T22:22:44  <amstan> McLeopold: shouldn't that be in setup_worker.py?

2011-05-05T22:23:15  <McLeopold> I wasn't sure if I would merge it in
2011-05-05T22:23:38  <amstan> it's about making users though, right?
2011-05-05T22:23:56  <McLeopold> the last part yes, it creates users from the sample bots
