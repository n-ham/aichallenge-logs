2012-05-26T05:21:05  <antimatroid1> thestinger: did you see what a1k0n posted?
2012-05-26T05:21:33  <thestinger> nope
2012-05-26T05:21:41  <thestinger> antimatroid1: I would something you would laugh at though
2012-05-26T05:21:44  <thestinger> let me find it again
2012-05-26T05:21:54  <antimatroid1> http://www.scribd.com/jobs/botrace
2012-05-26T05:23:39  <antimatroid1> it's a bit like food collection for ants
2012-05-26T05:24:05  <antimatroid1> i would game tree it as always
2012-05-26T05:24:20  <antimatroid1> each move being collecting a fruit obviously
2012-05-26T05:27:17  <antimatroid1> ermm... dunno how to run games locally though?
2012-05-26T05:28:33  <thestinger> antimatroid1: ok wait, you have to watch this
2012-05-26T05:28:46  <antimatroid1> this game intrigues me though
2012-05-26T05:28:46  <thestinger> I guarantee you will laugh at how stupid the people who made this movie are
2012-05-26T05:28:50  <antimatroid1> even though i have no spare time
2012-05-26T05:28:51  <thestinger> and they call it an 'intellectual thriller'
2012-05-26T05:28:55  <thestinger> antimatroid1: http://youtu.be/6ybd5rbQ5rU
2012-05-26T05:31:32  <antimatroid1> ahahaha
2012-05-26T05:31:42  <thestinger> well maybe it's not as the trailer makes it seem, but the clip where he's hacking computers with the travelling salesman problem in metasploit is wut
2012-05-26T05:31:45  <antimatroid1> "I thoughtï»¿ this was a joke."
2012-05-26T05:31:50  <antimatroid1> so did i until i read that comment
2012-05-26T05:31:54  <thestinger> they really didn't get competent consultants
2012-05-26T05:32:01  <antimatroid1> they never do
2012-05-26T05:33:33  <thestinger> "TRAVELLING SALESMAN is an intellectual thriller" ... lol
2012-05-26T05:33:48  <antimatroid1> i will be thrilled
2012-05-26T05:33:53  <antimatroid1> i'll give them that
2012-05-26T05:34:57  <mleise> come on , that *is* a joke, right?
2012-05-26T05:35:36  <thestinger> mleise: no...
2012-05-26T05:35:45  <antimatroid1> mleise: that's the joke
2012-05-26T05:35:46  <thestinger> I thought it was a parody
2012-05-26T05:35:46  <antimatroid1> it isn't
2012-05-26T05:35:51  <thestinger> it's a real srs bsns movie
2012-05-26T05:35:57  <mleise> no joke, no parody?
2012-05-26T05:36:04  <thestinger> nope, real movie
2012-05-26T05:36:15  <mleise> real governments hiring real mathematicans to comb the desert for coins?
2012-05-26T05:36:31  <antimatroid1> melt it!
2012-05-26T05:36:33  <mleise> Comb the desert!
2012-05-26T05:36:51  <mleise> you get the reference?
2012-05-26T05:36:53  <mleise> ok ok

2012-05-26T05:37:14  <thestinger> well someone solving p vs np allows them to hack people with a metasploit module called "travelling_salesman" and it is the greatest hacking algorithm ever known ???
2012-05-26T05:37:23  * thestinger doesn't get it
2012-05-26T05:37:25  <antimatroid1> could you not just use a metal detector and still have to walk over the entire fucking dessert to find the coin?

2012-05-26T23:24:51  <deltree_> any word on the next challenge yet?
2012-05-26T23:25:19  <deltree_> I've been redoing my planet wars bot out of boredome
2012-05-26T23:27:49  <_flag> ants is sort of a volunteer project -- right now nobody seems to be terribly motivated, so nothing is going on
2012-05-26T23:28:03  <_flag> or I shouldn't say "ants", I mean the ai challenge in general
2012-05-26T23:29:08  <deltree_> gotcha, I didn't enjoy ants
2012-05-26T23:31:29  <deltree_> I told them it was based a bit too much on optimization
2012-05-26T23:32:33  <_flag> This was even more true of Tron
2012-05-26T23:32:53  <thestinger> imo ants didn't require much optimization
2012-05-26T23:32:59  <thestinger> unless you used python/ruby...
2012-05-26T23:33:03  <_flag> In ants many of the top entries were at least java based, in tron it was all C++
2012-05-26T23:33:55  <thestinger> it was mostly strategy rather than coding, since the game mechanics made it into something like Go where you couldn't just minimax
2012-05-26T23:34:05  <deltree_> tron was 1000000 year sago
2012-05-26T23:35:16  <deltree_> I'm just stating my personal feelings on the matter. My bot in C# kept crashing from having too much to do.  Just building a map took my whole turn
2012-05-26T23:36:16  <thestinger> deltree_: mine worked in python before I added proper combat
2012-05-26T23:36:28  <thestinger> and it was still pretty good before that
2012-05-26T23:36:29  <_flag> Well you have to obviously be somewhat efficient, but the point was that efficiency wasn't the deciding factor
2012-05-26T23:36:34  <_flag> Obviously you can't be wasteful
2012-05-26T23:37:11  <antimatroid1> we're waiting to become a non-profit more than anything
2012-05-26T23:37:16  <thestinger> I could still do a search from every food on the map in python
2012-05-26T23:38:24  <_flag> antimatroid1: Has Jeff began the process on that?
2012-05-26T23:38:34  <antimatroid1> i think amstan was going to
2012-05-26T23:38:38  <antimatroid1> i don't think they have though
2012-05-26T23:38:42  <antimatroid1> they need time to do it
2012-05-26T23:38:52  <_flag> So basically everyone's sitting around, as I said :P
2012-05-26T23:39:14  <antimatroid1> i don't have time
2012-05-26T23:39:23  <antimatroid1> but i'd be down for writing tron bots again at some point
2012-05-26T23:39:26  <antimatroid1> without an actual contest
2012-05-26T23:39:52  <_flag> I'm not blaming you, I'm not doing anything either
2012-05-26T23:40:07  <thestinger> antimatroid1: pfft, you have time
2012-05-26T23:40:13  <_flag> But yeah, writing bots is usually appealing, writing game engines isn't as exciting
2012-05-26T23:40:35  <Zannick> writing engines that run the game engines...
2012-05-26T23:40:58  <_flag> Anyone know why these never caught on: https://github.com/smiley1983/ants-tcp ?
2012-05-26T23:41:00  <thestinger> antimatroid1: you just won't have time to find the optimal solution :)
2012-05-26T23:41:00  <antimatroid1> writing game engines is actually kind of fun
2012-05-26T23:41:07  <antimatroid1> but that's not a big part of getting a game up
2012-05-26T23:41:19  <_flag> There's versions of asteriods and warlight in there
2012-05-26T23:41:33  <antimatroid1> imo warlight is boring as shit to watch
2012-05-26T23:41:40  <_flag> True
2012-05-26T23:41:41  <antimatroid1> i'm keen on asteroids
2012-05-26T23:41:53  <antimatroid1> although what about removing the asteroids and adding fixed walls?
2012-05-26T23:42:08  <antimatroid1> so you fly around the course trying to shoot each other
2012-05-26T23:42:11  <_flag> I liked the idea of a non-turn-based game
2012-05-26T23:42:19  <antimatroid1> it's still turn based
2012-05-26T23:42:31  <Zannick> it only seems non-turn-based
2012-05-26T23:42:37  <_flag> So each player moves a set distance each turn?
2012-05-26T23:42:40  <Zannick> but then it's tick-based and essentially the same thing
2012-05-26T23:42:50  <_flag> Oh, I see
2012-05-26T23:42:51  <antimatroid1> they have variables like direction and velocity
2012-05-26T23:43:06  <antimatroid1> and you can control acceleration in a direction i assume in increments
2012-05-26T23:43:11  <antimatroid1> i haven't actually played around with it
2012-05-26T23:45:03  <antimatroid1> can i have people agree with me yet that random rules in the game mechanics suck?
2012-05-26T23:45:15  <antimatroid1> i know a lot of the top competitors in ants agreed
2012-05-26T23:45:23  <antimatroid1> especially chrisH with the spawning at bases :P
2012-05-26T23:45:32  <_flag> What do you mean random rules?
2012-05-26T23:45:48  <antimatroid1> like which base to spawn at if there's more than one feasible one
2012-05-26T23:46:05  <antimatroid1> or for example which direction asteroids split at
2012-05-26T23:46:11  <antimatroid1> rather than something a bot can model
2012-05-26T23:46:42  <_flag> I'm not so sure, if everything is completely deterministic then the contest becomes largely about simulating the game and a minmax search
2012-05-26T23:46:46  <antimatroid1> the state space in a game is already large enough without worrying about all the things that could happen with each move you make
2012-05-26T23:46:57  <_flag> With probability involved it's not as easy
2012-05-26T23:47:09  <_flag> But it's better for determining a concrete winner
2012-05-26T23:47:32  <antimatroid1> i don't think it makes minimax any less useful holding state space constant, it does increase the state space for a given game though if you will
2012-05-26T23:47:48  <antimatroid1> i'd rather a more complicated deterministic game though
2012-05-26T23:47:53  <antimatroid1> rather than a simple game with random elements
2012-05-26T23:48:14  <_flag> I agree with that, as long as the game is complex enough that it doesn't become an optimization race it's fine
2012-05-26T23:48:30  <_flag> That's the only reason I would agree to randomness
2012-05-26T23:48:35  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure tron was entirely optimisation based
2012-05-26T23:48:44  <antimatroid1> sure you couldn't be an inefficient baboon
2012-05-26T23:49:02  <_flag> Well I think the major breakthroughs were optimization based
2012-05-26T23:49:23  <_flag> Like a1k0n's checkerboard way of determining how to fill an area
2012-05-26T23:49:38  <antimatroid1> this is why i want past games to be continued to be "studied" after contests are over
2012-05-26T23:49:49  <antimatroid1> so ideas can be properly shared and we can see what really does work best
2012-05-26T23:50:03  <thestinger> antimatroid1: I agree that the randomness sucks
2012-05-26T23:50:10  <thestinger> like the fact that it was n-player and not 2-player
2012-05-26T23:50:15  <antimatroid1> what?
2012-05-26T23:50:19  <antimatroid1> that's fine
2012-05-26T23:50:21  <thestinger> from earlier
2012-05-26T23:50:30  <antimatroid1> that's not what i mean
2012-05-26T23:50:35  <thestinger> what then?
2012-05-26T23:50:38  <antimatroid1> that's like saying random maps aren't okay
2012-05-26T23:50:40  <_flag> antimatroid1: That would probably work if we could keep the main server running, since people tend to be motivated by having their bot show up on the scoreboard
2012-05-26T23:50:47  <antimatroid1> i don't like things being chosen randomly during the game
2012-05-26T23:50:49  <_flag> in regards to the studied thing
2012-05-26T23:51:02  <antimatroid1> i think main server isn't feasible
2012-05-26T23:51:09  <antimatroid1> it needs to be tcp based cause of money required
2012-05-26T23:51:19  <_flag> Yes, I know, but that's the only way I see people doing it
2012-05-26T23:51:22  <antimatroid1> just some official tcp servers would be good
2012-05-26T23:51:35  <antimatroid1> and perhaps have a few bots running on a main server
2012-05-26T23:51:42  <antimatroid1> which are only used if other matches can't be made
2012-05-26T23:51:44  <deltree_> I like the idea of a space game, it sounds better than the upcoming one http://0x10c.com/
2012-05-26T23:52:05  <deltree_> you could add to the challenge by making it 3d
2012-05-26T23:52:12  <antimatroid1> we want beginners to be able to participate
2012-05-26T23:52:22  <deltree_> 3d is just another direction to check for problems
2012-05-26T23:52:35  <_flag> Making things 3d doesn't affect strategy much though
2012-05-26T23:52:45  <antimatroid1> yeah, it's like nd tron
2012-05-26T23:52:47  <_flag> In most games you just modify a distance function
2012-05-26T23:52:51  <antimatroid1> it's not inherently harder than 2d
2012-05-26T23:52:54  <_flag> And add search directions
2012-05-26T23:52:56  <antimatroid1> just hte state space explodes
2012-05-26T23:55:03  <_flag> One thing I liked about planetWars over ants and trons was that there wasn't a binaryness to it. You don't just either send or not send ships, but you chose the amount to send
2012-05-26T23:55:09  <_flag> Which added a lot of depth IMO
2012-05-26T23:55:27  <antimatroid1> yeah i also liked that it had the feeling of "being solvable"
2012-05-26T23:55:37  <antimatroid1> i spent a lot of time on paper trying to do stuff mathematically
2012-05-26T23:55:47  <antimatroid1> and even 3 planet examples could be stupidly complicated
2012-05-26T23:55:52  <antimatroid1> it was a really cool problem
2012-05-26T23:55:57  <_flag> It felt like it should be solvable, but it wasn't trivial at all
2012-05-26T23:56:12  <antimatroid1> nope
2012-05-26T23:56:31  <antimatroid1> i think all three games went pretty well in the end
2012-05-26T23:56:42  <antimatroid1> ants went better than i expected
2012-05-26T23:56:52  <_flag> I'm surprised that they were all so decisive
2012-05-26T23:57:03  <antimatroid1> i was worried for xathis :P
2012-05-26T23:57:04  <_flag> ants got close, but xathis was clearly on top
2012-05-26T23:57:07  <antimatroid1> yep
2012-05-26T23:57:31  <antimatroid1> ahhh, reminiscing makes me want another challenge
2012-05-26T23:57:38  <_flag> Yeah, trueskill was pretty volitile, so I think he would feel sort of cheated if he lost at the last second
2012-05-26T23:57:53  <deltree_> see, told you ai contest is awesome
2012-05-26T23:58:02  <antimatroid1> i took measure and probability theory courses this semester
2012-05-26T23:58:15  <antimatroid1> i might sit down and play around with ranking at some point from a mathematical point of view
2012-05-26T23:58:20  <antimatroid1> i don't really understand it at present
