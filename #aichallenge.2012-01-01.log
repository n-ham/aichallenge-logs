2012-01-01T02:33:17  <antimatroid> i've seen people propose translating a few pages, i wonder if it would be a good idea to have people do this like writing starter bots?
2012-01-01T02:33:25  <antimatroid> mostly for the home/specs pages etc.

2012-01-01T03:25:10  <amstan> sigh: your config files are awesome, lol
2012-01-01T03:25:14  <sigh> haha :)
2012-01-01T03:25:16  <sigh> thanks
2012-01-01T03:25:29  <amstan> one question though, how is reporttime supposed to work?
2012-01-01T03:25:43  <amstan> just any command that takes more than one second? i can't get it to work
2012-01-01T03:25:57  <sigh> hang on, let me look it up
2012-01-01T03:26:40  <sigh> how are you testing it?
2012-01-01T03:26:52  <amstan> wget
2012-01-01T03:27:20  <amstan> wget https://github.com/downloads/aichallenge/aichallenge/nodejs_0.4.10~natty1~ppa201107202043_amd64.deb
2012-01-01T03:28:12  <sigh> if you set REPORTTIME=0 does that do anything?
2012-01-01T03:28:20  <sigh> that should report time for any command
2012-01-01T03:28:56  <amstan> yes
2012-01-01T03:29:34  <sigh> what did it print out for your wget command?
2012-01-01T03:29:46  <amstan> 4.68s real  0.02s user  0.08s system  1% cpu  4kB mem $ wget
2012-01-01T03:30:00  <sigh> ah, report time only care about user+system time
2012-01-01T03:30:10  <sigh> man zshparam for details
2012-01-01T03:30:19  <amstan> hmm
2012-01-01T03:30:21  <amstan> ok
2012-01-01T03:30:25  <amstan> so something that computes more things?
2012-01-01T03:30:30  <sigh> yeah
2012-01-01T03:30:49  <sigh> so sleep 10 is also very little actual time
2012-01-01T03:31:04  <sigh> dunno how to make it care about real time
2012-01-01T03:31:17  <amstan> yeah, it works if i do python -c "while 1: pass" then ctrl+c it
2012-01-01T03:32:32  <sigh> Mostly it works for commands when I need the info, so it works well enough :)
2012-01-01T03:32:58  <sigh> if you explicitly want time info just start the command with "time"
2012-01-01T03:33:07  <amstan> yeah
2012-01-01T03:33:24  <sigh> are you just starting with zsh?
2012-01-01T03:33:25  <amstan> how can i change its colour? replacing the tput setf 1 with fg[cyan] doesn't seem to work
2012-01-01T03:33:27  <amstan> yeah
2012-01-01T03:33:46  <amstan> and also with arch
2012-01-01T03:34:56  <sigh> nice :)
2012-01-01T03:34:59  <sigh> tput setf 3?
2012-01-01T03:35:08  <sigh> for cyan

2012-01-01T03:35:52  <sigh> I switched to zsh a few months ago after seeing on of y coworkers using it :)
2012-01-01T03:36:11  <amstan> i tried the same syntax for the PROMPT, where i could just do $fg[cyan]
2012-01-01T03:37:50  <sigh> yeah, I don't think that works with timefmt... the man pages certainly don't say anything about it
2012-01-01T03:38:09  <sigh> so just using the raw escape values works well enough
2012-01-01T03:38:17  <amstan> found the problem.. i needed autoload -U colors && colors
2012-01-01T03:38:23  <sigh> ahhh
2012-01-01T03:38:23  <amstan> to use the fg stuff
2012-01-01T03:39:06  <amstan> any idea how to make the home and end keys work?
2012-01-01T03:39:09  <sigh> ah cool... I might change mine too :)
2012-01-01T03:39:26  <sigh> what should they be doing?

2012-01-01T03:40:11  <amstan> go to the end and beggining of the line
2012-01-01T03:41:29  <sigh> does this work for the home key: bindkey '\e[5~' beginning-of-line
2012-01-01T03:42:41  <amstan> no
2012-01-01T03:43:03  <sigh> hmm... press CTRL-V Home on the command line, and tell me what it prints out
2012-01-01T03:43:21  <amstan> ^M
2012-01-01T03:43:34  <amstan> ^[[F for end
2012-01-01T03:44:25  <sigh> hmm.... ^M is weird... you should be able to remap End by using: bindkey '\e[F' end-of-line
2012-01-01T03:45:15  <sigh> dunno why home button is printing a carriage return :S Might be an issue with your terminal emulator?
2012-01-01T03:45:26  <amstan> yay, end works

2012-01-01T03:46:27  <amstan> right.. and delete is printing tildas
2012-01-01T03:46:56  <sigh> it does the same thing in bash, I assume?
2012-01-01T03:47:03  <amstan> no
2012-01-01T03:47:15  <sigh> hmmm... odd
2012-01-01T03:47:54  <amstan> it seems to work normally in zsh
2012-01-01T03:48:06  <sigh> oh ok
2012-01-01T03:48:23  <amstan> ctrl+v delete outputs: ^[[3~
2012-01-01T03:48:45  <sigh> yeah, if all else fails just remap that with '\e[3~'
2012-01-01T03:49:38  <sigh> dunno what's happening with home, I would first see if konsole is responsible for it... you can remap '^M' but I don't know if that will have side effects
2012-01-01T03:49:49  <sigh> yeah.... that messes up return :P
2012-01-01T03:49:53  <sigh> don't do that :)
2012-01-01T03:51:41  <amstan> and ctrl+d seems to be the real delete
2012-01-01T03:52:22  <sigh> you can type "bindkey" without any args to see all the current bindings
2012-01-01T03:52:33  <sigh> for me ctrl-d is bash-ctrl-d
2012-01-01T03:52:55  <amstan> oh, i took that out
2012-01-01T03:54:03  <sigh> aha... didn't realise it was some function I had made up :P
2012-01-01T03:54:14  <sigh> I don't even use it...
2012-01-01T03:54:48  <sigh> default for ctrl-d is delete-char-or-list
2012-01-01T03:54:59  <sigh> (all this is in man zshzle)
2012-01-01T03:56:07  <amstan> weird.. i get different behavoir from this zsh(archlinux) than from my server(ubuntu)

2012-01-01T07:24:01  <mcstar> he gave an example with the list-destuttering
2012-01-01T07:24:16  <mcstar> but that demonstrates ocaml's patter matching capability

2012-01-01T07:25:35  <mcstar> and it is not clear to me wether ocaml supports type classes or not

2012-01-01T11:18:13  <mcstar> do you have ghc?
2012-01-01T11:18:13  <ahow984_> so short
2012-01-01T11:18:24  <ahow984_> I'll just yum install it if I need to
2012-01-01T11:19:09  <mcstar> dont try 48x10 with it
2012-01-01T11:19:16  <mcstar> 48x4 works
2012-01-01T11:19:33  <mcstar> <4 height wont work in that case, because of idiosyncracies
2012-01-01T11:19:37  <ahow984_> 48*10 breaks the stack?
2012-01-01T11:19:41  <mcstar> no
2012-01-01T11:19:45  <mcstar> it just takes too long
2012-01-01T11:19:54  <mcstar> and Int cant hold that many elements
2012-01-01T11:20:16  <mcstar> but the examples will work

2012-01-01T11:20:33  <ahow984_> what filetype and how to compile do you mind?
2012-01-01T11:21:06  <mcstar> and this could be made as fast (and correct) as the c++ solution, but im not comfortable with haskell's mutable arrays, so i cant do the last step the efficient way
2012-01-01T11:21:18  <mcstar> ghc -O file.hs
2012-01-01T11:21:26  <mcstar> -O is for some optimization

2012-01-01T11:34:44  <mcstar> dont try input it cant handle

2012-01-01T11:35:04  <ahow984_> I thought it had to be made to take any inputs....
2012-01-01T11:35:15  <mcstar> i said it will handle the examples

2012-01-01T11:36:33  <ahow984_> btw, whats with the compiling/linking
2012-01-01T11:36:46  <mcstar> whats with it?
2012-01-01T11:36:46  <ahow984_> haskell must be very high-level even though it looks horrible
2012-01-01T11:37:26  <ahow984_> thers like 4 intermediate files
2012-01-01T11:37:49  <mcstar> it never bothered me
2012-01-01T11:38:12  <mcstar> maybe there's some option for ghc to clean up after itself
2012-01-01T11:38:20  <ahow984_> I don't mind the files
2012-01-01T11:38:42  <ahow984_> I just never saw a high level language looking so horrible :P

2012-01-01T11:39:44  <mcstar> i cant relate to that
2012-01-01T11:39:49  <mcstar> "horrible"
2012-01-01T11:39:52  <mcstar> thats a bit strong
2012-01-01T11:40:33  <ahow984_> maybe
2012-01-01T11:40:47  <ahow984_> to me its uninteligible
2012-01-01T11:41:41  <mcstar> start with "main" and work your way through
2012-01-01T11:42:06  <mcstar> but if you have absolutely no haskell background, that might prove difficult
2012-01-01T11:42:31  <ahow984_> yeah, this is my first look at haskell code
2012-01-01T11:42:37  <ahow984_> I'll give it a go
2012-01-01T11:44:15  <mcstar> if you want to rather read the (better) c++ solution i can paste that too
2012-01-01T11:45:06  <ahow984_> if you wouldn't mind :)
2012-01-01T11:45:09  <ahow984_> tyvm
2012-01-01T11:47:02  <mcstar> ahow984_: http://ideone.com/OgWiY
2012-01-01T11:47:30  <mcstar> but you need gcc 4.6 cause i use range based loops
2012-01-01T11:48:38  <ahow984_> huh, makePermutations()
2012-01-01T11:48:41  <ahow984_> interesting
2012-01-01T11:50:09  <mcstar> afaik haskell doesnt have that lexicographic next permutation function
2012-01-01T11:50:17  <mcstar> so i had to do it recursively
2012-01-01T11:50:34  <ahow984_> lol
2012-01-01T11:50:36  <mcstar> because im permutting possibly identical elements
2012-01-01T11:51:07  <ahow984_> how I was going to check for the intersection was by having a bool vector, true where the blocks meet for each layer
2012-01-01T11:51:27  <ahow984_> and then check if the layer below it was true
2012-01-01T11:51:48  <mcstar> do you understand how i do it?
2012-01-01T11:52:08  <ahow984_> still looking through it
2012-01-01T11:52:10  <mcstar> that nullIntersection checks for set intersections in ordered sets
2012-01-01T11:52:24  <ahow984_> it's pretty advanced C++, you should be fine for your interview ;)
2012-01-01T11:52:36  <mcstar> it isnt object oriented
2012-01-01T11:52:44  <mcstar> i still dont know that part
2012-01-01T11:52:57  <ahow984_> :/
2012-01-01T11:53:08  <mcstar> anyway, can you cmpile it?
2012-01-01T11:53:16  <ahow984_> you don't know about classes and inheritence and that?
2012-01-01T11:53:27  <mcstar> i know but not at a professional level
2012-01-01T11:53:36  <mcstar> details details details
2012-01-01T11:53:37  <ahow984_> ah
2012-01-01T11:53:40  <ahow984_> yeah
2012-01-01T11:53:45  <ahow984_> c++ is a bitch like that
2012-01-01T11:55:41  <ahow984_> I never saw for loops like that in C++ before
2012-01-01T11:55:43  <ahow984_> only perl
2012-01-01T11:57:22  <pairofdice> for loops like what
2012-01-01T11:57:31  <thestinger> the java-style syntax they added to C++11
2012-01-01T11:57:53  <pairofdice> Ah
2012-01-01T11:57:55  <ahow984_> yeah, range based for loops
2012-01-01T11:58:01  <pairofdice> for-each
2012-01-01T11:58:12  <thestinger> well, C++ also has for_each
2012-01-01T11:58:16  <ahow984_> like perl for(0..10)
2012-01-01T11:58:21  <thestinger> but it's like a twisted form of map()
2012-01-01T11:58:29  <ahow984_> it's in #include <algorithim though
2012-01-01T11:58:30  <antimatroid> woah, people!

2012-01-01T12:01:11  <ahow984_> meh, I can read the code
2012-01-01T12:01:28  <mcstar> i have 4.6.2 too
2012-01-01T12:01:41  <ahow984_> weird
2012-01-01T12:01:42  <mcstar> g++ -O3 -std=c++0x rwest.cpp -o rwest
2012-01-01T12:02:49  <ahow984_> >_<
2012-01-01T12:02:55  <ahow984_> I was using gcc lol
2012-01-01T12:02:57  <ahow984_> ty
2012-01-01T12:03:14  <mcstar> thestinger: in the last 2 days i improved my generic strategy, but unfortunately it had a bad effect on my battle(i didnt have time to properly test it)
2012-01-01T12:03:23  <mcstar> and yeah, they became stronger generally
2012-01-01T12:04:08  <thestinger> you can actually use gcc but then you have to pass a flag to link the C++ standard lib
2012-01-01T12:04:17  <ahow984_> mcstar: nice code :O

2012-01-01T12:08:31  <ahow984_> a programming puzzle
2012-01-01T12:08:39  <antimatroid> mcstar: cheers
2012-01-01T12:08:42  <mcstar> thestinger: rwest proposed this, werent you here?
2012-01-01T12:08:51  <antimatroid> i didn't expect top 10, although top 30 would have been nice
2012-01-01T12:09:01  <antimatroid> i was happy beating momobot and my planet wars ranking though
2012-01-01T12:09:05  <mcstar> close :D
2012-01-01T12:09:14  <thestinger> mcstar: nope, or at least I wasn't reading
2012-01-01T12:09:41  <ahow984_> while theres people around, is there anyone doing the upcoming ICPC challenge?
2012-01-01T12:10:29  <thestinger> strcat@arch i ~ % time ./test 48 10
2012-01-01T12:10:31  <thestinger> 806844323190414
2012-01-01T12:10:33  <thestinger> ./test 48 10  0.08s user 0.00s system 97% cpu 0.036 total
2012-01-01T12:10:47  <thestinger> mcstar: I'll have to read the puzzle now to figure out what your code does :P
2012-01-01T12:10:54  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-01T12:11:13  <ahow984_> :O thats some beast of a machine thestinger
2012-01-01T12:11:23  <thestinger> it is
2012-01-01T12:11:29  <ahow984_> :P
2012-01-01T12:11:38  <mcstar> ahow984_: core2 thestinger i7?
2012-01-01T12:11:38  <thestinger> i7 2600k @ 4.8GHz :)
2012-01-01T12:12:12  <thestinger> stock is... 3.4GHz iirc
2012-01-01T12:12:22  <thestinger> but it would just turbo up anyway
2012-01-01T12:12:23  <ahow984_> lol man
2012-01-01T12:12:32  <mcstar> if i had that cpu, id run it on 2.5 ghz
2012-01-01T12:12:44  <ahow984_> mcstar: yup, dual core 2.2 ghz
2012-01-01T12:12:50  <mcstar> and would take the heatsink frmo it
2012-01-01T12:12:54  <ahow984_> no overclocking
2012-01-01T12:13:19  <ahow984_> imo its just stupid overclocking a laptop :P
2012-01-01T12:13:29  <thestinger> well, this is a desktop :)
2012-01-01T12:13:31  <mcstar> amd x2 undervoltage, underclocked both cpu and memory
2012-01-01T12:13:49  <ahow984_> mcstar: nice and quiet :)
2012-01-01T12:13:54  <mcstar> yep
2012-01-01T12:14:03  <mcstar> with fancontrol
2012-01-01T12:14:10  <ahow984_> thestinger: I can't imagine theres too many laptops with them specs ;)
2012-01-01T12:14:42  <thestinger> this desktop is way quieter/more power efficient than my last one (an old socket 939 amd)
2012-01-01T12:14:56  <mcstar> i dont have the dough for that
2012-01-01T12:15:34  <thestinger> well, the whole computer was ~1100 dollars, but I reused a case/monitor/mouse/keyboard
2012-01-01T12:15:52  <ahow984_> for the next aichallenge, I should make an android app for it :P have the visualiser and a rank notifier and stuff
