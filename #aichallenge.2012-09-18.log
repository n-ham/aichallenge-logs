2012-09-18T08:54:23  <antimatroidl> mcstar: are you writing a rps bot?
2012-09-18T08:54:27  <antimatroidl> i am keen to have a play
2012-09-18T08:54:41  <mcstar> no
2012-09-18T08:54:46  <mcstar> i think that contest is over
2012-09-18T08:54:59  <mcstar> since you can look at all the sources
2012-09-18T08:55:01  <antimatroidl> it has recent submissions
2012-09-18T08:55:06  <mcstar> not that recent
2012-09-18T08:56:03  <antimatroidl> 12/09/2012?
2012-09-18T08:56:15  <antimatroidl> those are recent submissions
2012-09-18T08:58:34  <mcstar> 17th today
2012-09-18T08:58:42  <mcstar> so that was 5 days ago
2012-09-18T08:58:53  <mcstar> anyway, i submitted a bot, and it won
2012-09-18T08:59:09  <mcstar> Win rate100.0
2012-09-18T08:59:14  <mcstar> XD
2012-09-18T09:00:12  <mcstar> antimatroidl: but if the contest is not yet over, why cant i check the source of top bots?
2012-09-18T09:00:15  <mcstar> that is silly
2012-09-18T09:00:36  <mcstar> i think it is over, but you can still submit to satisfy your curiosity
2012-09-18T09:00:47  <mcstar> cant->can
2012-09-18T09:03:55  <mcstar> output = 'R' is not such a good strategy after all

2012-09-18T14:04:26  <NoZ_> I was just a bit curious about the ant challange, I know the tourny has endid but are people still uploading code and stuff?
2012-09-18T14:04:38  <NoZ_> or has it sort of died and waiting for the next one
2012-09-18T14:05:52  <mcstar> second
2012-09-18T14:06:05  <mcstar> you cant upload anything since it has ended a long time ago
2012-09-18T14:06:17  <mcstar> but you can still work on your bot, if you have time for it
2012-09-18T14:06:39  <mcstar> it would be interesting to see a future Ants contest, but much more advenced bots
2012-09-18T14:07:05  <mcstar> but that is massively hypothetical atm
2012-09-18T14:07:26  <mcstar> and no, noone knows when will the next contest take place
2012-09-18T14:08:20  <mcstar> and no, it wont be Ants
2012-09-18T14:09:59  <NoZ_> ahh I thought they might of kept the server going, just for fun
2012-09-18T14:10:07  <NoZ_> thats a bit disapointing

2012-09-18T14:17:16  <mcstar> -cant
2012-09-18T14:17:46  <mcstar> or even set up your own server to play against your buddies
