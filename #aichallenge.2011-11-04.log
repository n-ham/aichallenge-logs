2011-11-04T00:00:00  <Dimentox> clck maybe take out any good logic
2011-11-04T00:00:08  <Dimentox> and just make it base with your new io
2011-11-04T00:00:10  <Dimentox> and try it
2011-11-04T00:00:15  <Dimentox> if it fails have someone compile it
2011-11-04T00:00:19  <Dimentox> and test
2011-11-04T00:00:33  <Dimentox> without the logic your save to see if its teh io stuff
2011-11-04T00:00:34  <clckwrk> ok maybe not questionable, but I've no real insite into failure so how can I debug remote timeouts?
2011-11-04T00:01:10  <ccc> I'm using this script for testing and seems to work well, can you give it a try "python tools/playgame.py "MyBot_o" "upload/MyBot" --map_file tools/maps/multi_hill_maze/maze_02p_01.map --turntime 1 --log_dir game_logs --turns 150 --player_seed 7 --viewradius2=77 --verbose -e -I -O"
2011-11-04T00:01:12  <krishna> clckwrk: Is your bot in an early state that won't reveal much? I could try to compile/run it for you on a Ubuntu machine I have handy and see if that flushes anything out.
2011-11-04T00:01:38  <clckwrk> krishna: I've an ubuntu machine in virtual box where I could do the same thanks though.
2011-11-04T00:02:28  <krishna> Ah. I don't have the computing power to appreciate virtualization. Wouldn't have even thought of it. :)
2011-11-04T00:02:31  <ccc> each games timeout is different, don't know what settings you are using, '
2011-11-04T00:02:38  <scombinator> Yay my bot submitted correctly
2011-11-04T00:03:16  <scombinator> I'd quite like it if "play_one_game_live.sh" selected a random map
2011-11-04T00:03:41  <Dimentox> randomise it
2011-11-04T00:03:42  <Dimentox> :p
2011-11-04T00:04:06  <scombinator> hmm... I'm going to have to do something to test against my previous bots

2011-11-04T00:20:25  <roflmao> noet necessarily
2011-11-04T00:20:29  <roflmao> if you are ain a one hill 8p map
2011-11-04T00:20:38  <roflmao> it is mutually assured destruction
2011-11-04T00:20:50  <roflmao> you might get 2 points and lose one but once you lose all your hills its GG for you
2011-11-04T00:22:28  <bobbydroptable> i'm not talking about a single game, talking about over several games
2011-11-04T00:24:25  <bobbydroptable> if we compare a purely defensive vs purely offensive strategy, a defensive strategy doesn't get any points because it's just defending. so if you had to pick between the two, you would go for an offensive one first.
2011-11-04T00:24:25  <scombinator> Well I only signed up today
2011-11-04T00:24:57  <bobbydroptable> so, concentrate on aggression first, then support it with defensive strategies

2011-11-04T00:53:05  <userjjb> OOP is just a very different paradigm then what I'm used to, half of the keywords are devoted to all the OOP stuff and seems so superfluous, things like "abstract" why the heck do you have to make a base class and then a subclass of that class to actually do something? It seems needlessly complex

2011-11-04T00:55:51  <ccc> finally my scp worked, it wasnt' working before because I was scp'ing while inside the remote machine
2011-11-04T00:55:51  <avdg> *a hammer
2011-11-04T00:56:18  <userjjb> avdg: Yeah that's the thing I feel like 80% of the people making bots are CompSci people and so the extra overhead of having "good" code is quite small. I want to make a bot as an engineer because I enjoy algorithmic problem solving, instead I've spent all my time just trying to understand what's happening in the starter package
2011-11-04T00:56:45  <avdg> userjjb: I was quite happy with js when I started the ai competition
2011-11-04T00:56:58  <bobbydroptable> i believe many of the oop principles, such as abstract classes, come from the needs of large-scale systems. about half of it is "maintainable architecture" and the other half is "prevent stupid people from doing stupid things"
2011-11-04T00:57:33  <avdg> the main reason: the api was pretty simple, and I could break the structure (phpdocs, classes, over organization, documentation, and a big pile of worries other people are adding)
2011-11-04T00:58:24  <avdg> but I still hate trailing spaces and mixing tabs and spaces together :-)
2011-11-04T00:58:57  <amstan> avdg: the way to do true tabs is to mix tabs and spaces
2011-11-04T00:59:10  <amstan> avdg: tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment
2011-11-04T00:59:12  <userjjb> bobbydroptable: Yeah so in a case where I don't have 91238428347928 lines of code it's not really needed. I just don't feel like having to rewrite the starter package procedurally before I can even begin, but I guess either way there's an unpleasant pill to swallow
2011-11-04T00:59:27  <amstan> userjjb: see C starter then
2011-11-04T01:00:03  <avdg> amstan: true, but I mean the usage of spaces where tabs could be used (meaning that you will get a very beautiful result when the tab settings are changed)
2011-11-04T01:00:12  <amstan> yes
2011-11-04T01:00:26  <amstan> or tabs where spaces should be used
2011-11-04T01:00:28  <amstan> like aligning
2011-11-04T01:00:56  <avdg> yeah, especially in comments
2011-11-04T01:00:59  <amstan> yep
2011-11-04T01:02:11  <avdg> man, I can't sleep, I'm feeling too good to sleep
2011-11-04T01:03:00  <bobbydroptable> that's nice
2011-11-04T01:03:06  <bobbydroptable> i usually feel too crap to sleep
2011-11-04T01:04:12  <amstan> so.. i have yet to see a video on youtube that shows a drop bear attack
2011-11-04T01:04:19  <amstan> every video they have so far is hilarious

2011-11-04T01:48:13  <krishna> I threw a tcp server up. But I'm guessing all those people who wanted to use one immediately have gone off to bed
2011-11-04T01:48:18  <Rinum> but I get an error?
2011-11-04T01:48:25  <krishna> What error?

2011-11-04T01:50:01  <scombinator> I've considered shifting to C, but any inefficiencies tend to be algorithmic
2011-11-04T01:50:40  <Rinum> I just get this SandboxError: Failed to start ['MyBot']
2011-11-04T01:50:46  <krishna> I wasn't necessarily language hopping for speed.
2011-11-04T01:50:59  <krishna> Rinum: Is the path correct?
2011-11-04T01:51:11  <Rinum> yup, I just moved the file right now
2011-11-04T01:51:22  <Rinum> it's in the same dir as play_one_game.sh
2011-11-04T01:51:24  <scombinator> Ugh... stupid greedy bot, I keep thinking its errors are from my bot
2011-11-04T01:51:41  <bobbydroptable> lol yeh me too
2011-11-04T01:51:46  <krishna> Is the executable actually MyBot, not mybot.exe or something like that?

2011-11-04T01:59:41  <scombinator> krishna thanks you
2011-11-04T01:59:54  <Rinum> mine sucks primarily because my pathfinding stuff takes too long in python

2011-11-04T02:33:38  <NakedJeff> it's not doing too terribly on the official site… :/

2011-11-04T02:34:36  <scombinator> or for my org
2011-11-04T02:34:49  <scombinator> blue's kinda dense, and orange is very sparse
2011-11-04T02:35:20  <scombinator> Yellow has very nice hill defense
2011-11-04T02:36:16  <krishna> scombinator: And eventually flips out stops reacting sanely and then times out

2011-11-04T02:38:02  <scombinator> I think yellow actually won that. It's the only one to get a hill cap
2011-11-04T02:38:13  <NakedJeff> i like how my entire army ends up hovering around a piece of food that it's too chicken to eat, because of two of your yellow guys
2011-11-04T02:38:21  <krishna> scombinator: No time check with this version yet. Rewrote my bot for the third time in haskell

2011-11-04T02:49:33  <nmalbran> watch a the game settings... i think timeturn is like 5 sec... while normal is 1 sec
2011-11-04T02:50:00  <krishna> Yeah. It's longer to account for the fact that we are sending everything over the internet.
2011-11-04T02:50:02  <NakedJeff> normal is half a second

2011-11-04T03:04:03  <krishna> I see why I was timing out more and more often. If I queue up a bunch of games, they don't all quit until all the games are over.
2011-11-04T03:04:27  <krishna> So I was filling up memory with MyBots
2011-11-04T03:04:48  <krishna> I definitely still have a timeout problem, but not such a frequent one
2011-11-04T03:05:06  <krishna> Rinum: You had that game solidly one by the time I timed out.
2011-11-04T03:06:17  <krishna> NakedJeff: That looked like it might have ultimately become a stalmate though. Neither of our bots is particular aggressive.
2011-11-04T03:06:37  <krishna> An army will flee from a single ant
2011-11-04T03:07:14  <NakedJeff> krishna: true
2011-11-04T03:07:25  <Rinum> I need to implement this dude's defense strat! http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=48944&user=3845

2011-11-04T03:08:32  <bobbydroptable> oh that is pretty sweet lol
2011-11-04T03:08:44  <bobbydroptable> but not foolproof
2011-11-04T03:09:16  <bobbydroptable> lol his defense broke up http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=54213&user=3845
2011-11-04T03:09:16  <nmalbran> but quite usefull :D
2011-11-04T03:09:54  <Rinum> lol his ants ran away
2011-11-04T03:09:58  <scombinator> the square around his hill?
2011-11-04T03:10:04  <bobbydroptable> i guess the drawback is that if the scout ants die he has to use his defense to go on
2011-11-04T03:10:34  <nmalbran> i think he keep the defense while having num of ants > x.... if not... they go exploring...
2011-11-04T03:10:36  <scombinator> Has anyone looked into predicting where enemy hills are?
2011-11-04T03:10:47  <nmalbran> mmm not yet
2011-11-04T03:10:51  <Rinum> I've thought about it
2011-11-04T03:10:57  <scombinator> I'm guessing that's what Mr. Parasprites did
2011-11-04T03:11:26  <nmalbran> another drawback is that he use to many ants to protect...
2011-11-04T03:11:26  <bobbydroptable> i'd rather focus on a solid bot rather than a bot that depends on prediction
2011-11-04T03:12:40  <scombinator> Heh, "Run aways there's one of them and 8 of us!"
2011-11-04T03:13:28  <scombinator> Time to work on a visibility map now

2011-11-04T03:18:10  <userjjb> sigh, I really want to participate but I have no clue where to even begin. The starter packages seem to assume you already know what's going on with expected formatting of input and output. And the tutorial skips from install/setup right to adding features, with no explanation of what the starter package is actually doing
2011-11-04T03:18:32  <userjjb> Is there a good tutorial in the forums or something?
2011-11-04T03:19:11  <antimatroid> userjjb: the starter packages are there so you can ignore most of the input format :)
2011-11-04T03:19:17  <antimatroid> there are tutorials on the website
2011-11-04T03:19:42  <userjjb> Right, but most of the packages give little explaantion of what's going on in the code

2011-11-04T03:22:32  <ccc> userjjb: even i was confused by the starter packages, i'm really bad at understanding others code, so instead i wrote my own input line parser are datastructures from the beginning, took me whole 1 day
2011-11-04T03:23:11  <ccc> read the game specs page
2011-11-04T03:24:29  <nmalbran> im using python, and the parser is well commented... i didnt have problems to understand it... except some hardcoded parts

2011-11-04T03:26:03  <userjjb> ccc: That's what I want to do, is there a way to see the actual output of the game so I can get an idea of how to read it in?
2011-11-04T03:26:21  <Garf> read the spec
2011-11-04T03:26:43  <userjjb> when I run play_one_game.cmd and look at the console output it doesn't seem to show what I expect
2011-11-04T03:27:03  <userjjb> is there a verbose flag or something?
2011-11-04T03:27:06  <Garf> http://aichallenge.org/specification.php -> "Below is sample input for player 'a' in the above game"
2011-11-04T03:27:19  <scombinator> There's a arg you can add to the playgame.py where you can see the stderr
2011-11-04T03:27:19  <nmalbran> nope, play_one_game output more readable output for human... not actual output for bot
2011-11-04T03:27:23  <scombinator> I think it's '-e'
2011-11-04T03:27:23  <ccc> on the visualizer you have a robot icon at bottom right hand called "bot in", that will give you exact engine input for each turn
2011-11-04T03:27:24  <Garf> userjjb: it shows the state of the game, not all the inputs for all players
2011-11-04T03:27:50  <userjjb> cool, thanks guys, off to give it another try

2011-11-04T05:49:06  <pedrosorio> I have written about it more than once in the forums
2011-11-04T05:49:16  <janzert> deactivation is working properly, but being an established bot (so you give more information to the rankings) can more than make up for it
2011-11-04T05:50:26  <janzert> there are current 1646 deactivated bots with 0 games in the past 24 hours btw

2011-11-04T05:53:17  <pairofdice> yup^^
2011-11-04T05:53:21  <NotABug> precisely, what is it based on ? sigma ?
2011-11-04T05:53:48  <scombinator> It doesn't look like elo
2011-11-04T05:53:56  <janzert> NotABug: that is what is effecting it, yes. It is the truskill match quality
2011-11-04T05:53:58  <Fluxid> sigma is "true" skill, mu is uncertainty
2011-11-04T05:54:06  <janzert> Fluxid: reverse
2011-11-04T05:54:10  <Fluxid> right!

2011-11-04T06:03:07  <NotABug> yes of course the old version gets deactivated as soon as you upload a new one, is there another possibility ?
2011-11-04T06:03:59  <thestinger> will the viewradius2 and attackradius2 settings always be integers?
2011-11-04T06:04:18  <scombinator> The point of making them the squared version was so they would be

2011-11-04T06:31:30  <sjoerd_visscher> 10 games takes 3 days at the moment

2011-11-04T06:32:06  <sjoerd_visscher> how is it that 9 out of 10 opponents is deactivated?
2011-11-04T06:32:27  <sjoerd_visscher> are there so many deactivated bots in the top 500?
2011-11-04T06:32:32  <janzert> they haven't activated or resubmitted in the past 3 days?

2011-11-04T06:32:56  <NotABug> what about the donation thing to have more workers ? I think many would be willing to participate, but maybe it is complicated to setup ?
2011-11-04T06:33:18  <janzert> Jeff is supposed to be working on it, but he is the only one that can do it

2011-11-04T06:42:18  <mcstar> how does it help this problem?
2011-11-04T06:42:35  <thestinger> so you can do 'auto it = container.begin()' instead of 'std::vector<int>::iterator it = container.begin()', etc.

2011-11-04T06:50:24  <mcstar> and its the same for maps too
2011-11-04T06:50:24  <thestinger> ah, they're ordered sets
2011-11-04T06:50:41  <thestinger> you want unordered_set and unordered_map (you need C++11, which we have now :D) for hash based ones

2011-11-04T06:51:39  <mcstar> sure? map isnt hashed?
2011-11-04T06:52:05  <thestinger> nope, it's a tree (at least in gcc)
2011-11-04T06:52:20  <thestinger> unordered_map is definitely a hash table though
2011-11-04T06:52:23  <mcstar> well, with a high branching factor i guess a tree comes close

2011-11-04T07:16:55  <mcstar> so these elements are of class* type
2011-11-04T07:17:13  <mcstar> when i kill my list, i want to delete those classes as well
2011-11-04T07:17:33  <mcstar> what do you think is better than iterating over the elements and kill them one-by-one?
2011-11-04T07:18:08  <thestinger> destructors, and use references/smart pointers rather than C pointers
2011-11-04T07:18:41  <mcstar> i was considering those atl pointers too
2011-11-04T07:19:19  <mcstar> so you mean, i should make the list std::list<myclass&> ?
2011-11-04T07:19:49  <mcstar> well, actually std::list<myclass&>* mylist is better
2011-11-04T07:20:21  <mcstar> and when i say delete mylist, it will kill the classes properly?

2011-11-04T07:21:06  <mcstar> mylist.push_back(myclass(constructor arguments)) will initialize the references
2011-11-04T07:21:21  <thestinger> well, it will call the destructors
2011-11-04T07:21:29  <thestinger> you could just do std::list<myclass> instead
2011-11-04T07:22:01  <mcstar> no
2011-11-04T07:22:09  <mcstar> i want to move those classes around
2011-11-04T07:22:21  <mcstar> and i only want to free those that i leave in the list
2011-11-04T07:22:30  <mcstar> so poitners are well suited for this
2011-11-04T07:22:38  <mcstar> but im not sure i can do this with refs
2011-11-04T07:22:46  <mcstar> and with <myclass> im sure i cant
2011-11-04T07:22:50  <thestinger> ah, you probably want shared pointers
2011-11-04T07:23:05  <thestinger> they basically do reference counting and then call the destructor when there aren't any references
2011-11-04T07:23:25  <mcstar> are those in stl too?
2011-11-04T07:24:09  <DummySphere> janzert: would it be possible to choose the wanted interpreter in the profile page? i.e. for Lua files: vanilla Lua, LuaJIT 2.0.0 beta 5 or LuaJIT 2.0.0 beta 8
2011-11-04T07:24:22  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah, there are a few types of them
2011-11-04T07:24:48  <thestinger> you probably want to do a bit of searching and figure out which one is best for what you want - I haven't really used C++ for very long either so I'm not sure

2011-11-04T07:25:19  <thestinger> ah, you want scoped_ptr for a single reference and shared_ptr when you need ref counting
2011-11-04T07:25:22  <janzert> DummySphere: it would take the addition of a new mechanism to do that

2011-11-04T07:28:12  <thestinger> it gets you the same thing I think

2011-11-04T07:30:26  <DummySphere> and what about changing the extension (.luajit2-8 :S) or to add a special file in submitted archive?
2011-11-04T07:31:25  <mcstar> i guess its a mess to install those different versions side by side
2011-11-04T07:31:47  <thestinger> mcstar: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp this looks good
2011-11-04T07:32:02  <mcstar> :) already there
2011-11-04T07:33:06  <janzert> DummySphere: the other problem with upgrading to latest is that what we are using now is the version in ubuntu natty so it's a simple 'apt-get install luajit' for anything newer we'll need to install it from scratch
2011-11-04T07:33:38  <janzert> that problem remains if we replace the current version or add it as a 'separate' language
2011-11-04T07:35:52  <DummySphere> ok, so what you are saying is that it will be luajit 2.0.0 beta5 until the end of this contest?
2011-11-04T07:36:04  <janzert> that is most likely yes

2011-11-04T07:39:26  <conor_f> mcstar: IMO, it's poor compared to the PY/Java ones
2011-11-04T07:39:27  <DummySphere> mcstar: or I can try to make a C package with luajit 2.0.0 beta8 sources and my bot :)
2011-11-04T07:39:45  <jbroman> And at least one must refer to the other using a pointer or reference, not by including the struct in its class. Because if every A contains a B, but every B contains another A, you'd need an infinitely large struct anyways.
2011-11-04T07:39:56  <conor_f> jbroman: I'm trying that, like struct State; before the ant class
2011-11-04T07:40:12  <conor_f> ach
2011-11-04T07:40:14  <conor_f> yeah

2011-11-04T07:44:26  <DummySphere> the thing is I do C++ for my job, so I like to code in Lua for fun stuff :)
2011-11-04T07:44:59  <mcstar> i think c++ is well suited for this kind of thing
2011-11-04T07:45:05  <conor_f> :O
2011-11-04T07:45:10  <conor_f> It compiled!
2011-11-04T07:45:14  <avdg> ty pedrosorio
2011-11-04T07:45:19  <conor_f> great feeling :P
2011-11-04T07:45:35  <avdg> dunno if it helps a lot if its a tcp game though :-)
2011-11-04T07:45:41  <mcstar> well, actually any statically typed language is a good choice
2011-11-04T07:45:51  <mcstar> or "typed" language
2011-11-04T07:45:52  <pairofdice> Pf
2011-11-04T07:46:48  <mcstar> nice idea on the overlays

2011-11-04T07:51:39  <DummySphere> mcstar: I've found Lua very well suited for this too :) C++ require just more line of code for the same result (but faster, but not so much thanks to luajit)
2011-11-04T07:52:14  <mcstar> and dont you find yourself writing better code because of the compiler has strong type system?
2011-11-04T07:52:27  <mcstar> i dont make bugs, like in common lisp
2011-11-04T07:52:55  <antimatroid> conor_f: are you saying the c++ starter bot isn't nice? :P
2011-11-04T07:53:02  <mcstar> its almost as in haskell "when your program compiles, porbably it does what you inteded to do"
2011-11-04T07:53:32  <mcstar> (i not really comparing c++ to haskell, only the statically typed aspect of it)
2011-11-04T07:53:44  <antimatroid> what makes the java and python starter bots nicer :\
2011-11-04T07:53:48  <conor_f> antimatroid: yeah, it's poorly laid out/designed and hasn't got all the features the PY bot has
2011-11-04T07:53:56  <mcstar> :S
2011-11-04T07:53:57  <conor_f> *IMO
2011-11-04T07:54:00  <antimatroid> which features?
2011-11-04T07:54:08  <conor_f> getNextMove for one
2011-11-04T07:54:19  <antimatroid> what is that even meant to be?
2011-11-04T07:54:31  <antimatroid> btw i wrote the c++ starter bot :P
2011-11-04T07:54:37  <conor_f> yeah, figured :P
2011-11-04T07:54:57  <conor_f> it returns the best way to move given a dest location and a start location
2011-11-04T07:55:08  <mcstar> DummySphere: otherwise i agree, it is way too much verbose
2011-11-04T07:55:12  <conor_f> returns an array/dict/whatever of the best moves in order
2011-11-04T07:55:16  <antimatroid> it does path finding for you?
2011-11-04T07:55:24  <antimatroid> who the hell put that in a starter bot?
2011-11-04T07:55:39  <antimatroid> the starter package strategies are meant to be crap
2011-11-04T07:55:43  <DummySphere> for sure, you have to launch the program to check you have not misspelled a variable
2011-11-04T07:55:46  <antimatroid> it's just meant to get you started writing your own bot
2011-11-04T07:55:56  <conor_f> :P
2011-11-04T07:56:00  <antimatroid> what's laid out badly with the c++ bot?
2011-11-04T07:56:10  <antimatroid> i set all my bots up like that and actually quite like the structure
2011-11-04T07:56:17  <conor_f> fair enough
2011-11-04T07:56:22  <conor_f> this is all IMO
2011-11-04T07:56:25  <DummySphere> but for a little amount of code, I prefer Lua (not the same for a large scale project)
2011-11-04T07:56:41  <mcstar> DummySphere: i expect this to be a not-so-small project
2011-11-04T07:56:45  <conor_f> well, whats the need for the bot class? or the debug class?
2011-11-04T07:56:57  <mcstar> my c++ bot is stupid, and i already reached 1000 lines
2011-11-04T07:57:09  <pairofdice> :|
2011-11-04T07:57:10  <conor_f> I just bundled all them into one .cpp file
2011-11-04T07:57:24  <pairofdice> My bot reaches stupidity at much smaller size
2011-11-04T07:57:24  <mcstar> conor_f: lol?
2011-11-04T07:57:35  <conor_f> pairofdice: me too :P
2011-11-04T07:57:42  <mcstar> pairofdice: has pathfinding and influence maps
2011-11-04T07:57:45  <conor_f> mcstar: yeah, whats wrong with doing that? :P
2011-11-04T07:57:57  <mcstar> conor_f: use c than
2011-11-04T07:57:59  <antimatroid> bot class just makes it easier to put strategy specific code in one place
2011-11-04T07:58:00  <conor_f> I'm now making an ant class for each individual ant
2011-11-04T07:58:06  <mcstar> or c 78
2011-11-04T07:58:15  <DummySphere> my bot is 600 lines of code, and start to be good
2011-11-04T07:58:26  <conor_f> mcstar: you never said what was wrong with it ;)
2011-11-04T07:58:49  <mcstar> i dont think that antimatroid is wrong in trying to establish a structure
2011-11-04T07:58:50  <antimatroid> conor_f: where would you put the bot file stuff?
2011-11-04T07:58:54  <mcstar> thats what c++ is about
2011-11-04T07:58:55  <conor_f> antimatroid: don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have had a clue what to do without the starter bot
2011-11-04T07:59:01  <conor_f> but I'd just do it differently
2011-11-04T07:59:39  <conor_f> maybe it's just that I'm not used to complicated headers and stuff
2011-11-04T07:59:39  <mcstar> conor_f: and pouring all code into 1 file? thats silly, excuse me
2011-11-04T07:59:46  <antimatroid> i have my own one set up slightly differently, but it mostly has the same structure
2011-11-04T07:59:52  <conor_f> but I prefer it my way :P

2011-11-04T08:00:09  <conor_f> mcstar: not all of it, Location.h and Square.h are separate
2011-11-04T08:00:18  <antimatroid> and bug is because i like to debug stuff to file
2011-11-04T08:00:21  <conor_f> because they've got multiple instances
2011-11-04T08:00:22  <mcstar> i have 10 separate files, all has its own thing, it is almost logical
2011-11-04T08:00:34  <antimatroid> and if you use that thing then it'll strip all debug stuff on compile without you having to explicitly remove it etc.
2011-11-04T08:00:38  <thestinger> my bot logic goes in one MyBot.cpp file (I still have the input parsing stuff separate), and all my algorithms like the graph stuff are in headers
2011-11-04T08:00:42  <conor_f> wheras timer, state, bot, they all have only one instance
2011-11-04T08:01:03  <antimatroid> thestinger: you still have a state struct right?
2011-11-04T08:01:10  <antimatroid> you'll want that if you ever make a game tree
2011-11-04T08:01:16  <thestinger> yeah, I still have that
2011-11-04T08:01:21  <conor_f> antimatroid: I still have that, it's just included in the main file
2011-11-04T08:01:23  <thestinger> I don't have the Bot one though

2011-11-04T08:02:59  <antimatroid> mcstar: i call iterators it :)
2011-11-04T08:03:07  <antimatroid> i also hate iterators
2011-11-04T08:03:11  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-04T08:03:31  <conor_f> antimatroid: was wondering why there was no #include <iterator> :P
2011-11-04T08:03:40  <antimatroid> that needs an include?
2011-11-04T08:03:44  <mcstar> no
2011-11-04T08:03:46  <conor_f> I dunno, I always did
2011-11-04T08:03:50  <conor_f> my bad so, :P
2011-11-04T08:04:29  <mcstar> my present code is much better than the one uploaded, i figured out the correct use of stringstreams too
2011-11-04T08:04:52  <antimatroid> string streams area amazing
2011-11-04T08:05:16  <mcstar> antimatroid: and i added friend << operators for certain classes
2011-11-04T08:05:19  <antimatroid> i'm a huge fan of the way c++ treats streams with the >> and << operators
2011-11-04T08:05:27  <antimatroid> i know a lot of people hate it, but i really like the way it works
2011-11-04T08:05:27  <userjjb> what is the benefit of having multiple source files in c++?
2011-11-04T08:05:39  <antimatroid> userjjb: split stuff up
2011-11-04T08:05:59  <mcstar> userjjb: you can organize the stuff better, and you can keeps the whole thing better "in mind"
2011-11-04T08:06:05  <mcstar> and you can find things more easily
2011-11-04T08:06:31  <mcstar> and , you dont have to recompile everything all the time
2011-11-04T08:06:37  <userjjb> I find it annoying to have to unravel the yarnball of includes etc in the starter package
2011-11-04T08:06:38  <mcstar> only ther part that you changed
2011-11-04T08:06:56  <mcstar> userjjb: you can avoid that by writing your own
2011-11-04T08:07:00  <userjjb> I am
2011-11-04T08:07:16  <antimatroid> imo it should be pretty obvious when something needs something else :P
2011-11-04T08:07:17  <userjjb> Except I have no C++ experience so I'm teaching myself as I go

2011-11-04T08:07:41  <antimatroid> i set it up as a project file in code::blocks too, so that deals with linking etc. for me
2011-11-04T08:07:43  <userjjb> Currently trying to understand how the starter package actuallly reads in input with cin
2011-11-04T08:07:45  <antimatroid> i just hit compile
2011-11-04T08:07:52  <mcstar> userjjb: learn c++ only if you will need it for a job or something
2011-11-04T08:08:06  <antimatroid> userjjb: i've overloaded the operator >> for input streams
2011-11-04T08:08:17  <antimatroid> cin is an input stream, but so is an input file stream etc.
2011-11-04T08:08:29  <antimatroid> so you can feed pseudo state information from a file to your bot if you want
2011-11-04T08:08:33  <antimatroid> and test the output etc.
2011-11-04T08:08:40  <userjjb> interesting
2011-11-04T08:08:50  <mcstar> i dont recommend learning c++ only if you can earn money with it really
2011-11-04T08:08:59  <mcstar> take my word, i know it, i read it somewhere
2011-11-04T08:09:03  <antimatroid> same as you can overload << for output streams, which is like your output function
2011-11-04T08:09:15  <userjjb> I've looked at C# and I despise the OOP splattered all over it
2011-11-04T08:09:50  <userjjb> And what as much headroom as possible so I can be sloppy with algorithms so that rules out some of the slower interpreeted languages
2011-11-04T08:09:55  <antimatroid> the thing i really like is how well they compose together on one line
2011-11-04T08:10:06  <antimatroid> input and output functions that is
2011-11-04T08:10:06  <mcstar> antimatroid: why isnt your name: << OverLord >>  ?
2011-11-04T08:10:33  <antimatroid> why?
2011-11-04T08:10:45  <mcstar> because you always overload << >>
2011-11-04T08:10:48  <mcstar> :D
2011-11-04T08:10:57  <userjjb> antimatroid: Yeah I guess I have to read up on overloading, like I said, as of yesterday I knew nothing of the language, I've only used Matlab until now

2011-11-04T08:15:34  <underlord> and define plies?

2011-11-04T08:16:06  <conor_f> but nope
2011-11-04T08:16:12  <underlord> i expect them to already need to partition ants up lots
2011-11-04T08:16:37  <underlord> with up to 5 moves per ant that's up to 5^n terminal nodes in your tree

2011-11-04T08:53:04  <mcstar> i think its easier than using a file for debugging, since the engine can do that for you anyway

2011-11-04T08:53:44  <userjjb> C++, I'm a total noob so figured that was the easiest way
2011-11-04T08:54:26  <thestinger> std::cerr << whatever << more crap << std::endl; will write to stderr (instead of stdout, which goes to the engine)
2011-11-04T08:54:29  <userjjb> I take it the engine has some sort of built in funstionality for displaying debug type stuff inside it?

2011-11-04T09:22:05  <mleise> 10 minutes seems to be enough to compile a lot of code. Sure, GCC or LibreOffice take longer, but I've yet to see an Ant bot that requires a minute to compile.
2011-11-04T09:22:24  <mleise> Then again I haven't seen many :p
2011-11-04T09:22:33  <conor_f> 10 mins is plenty :P
2011-11-04T09:23:04  <mcstar> mleise: it takes only a couple of lines to write a templated logic that solved a combinatoric problem
2011-11-04T09:23:11  <mcstar> solves*
2011-11-04T09:23:41  <thestinger> yeah, the 2MB limit on uploads encourages uses template metaprogramming stuff

2011-11-04T09:24:24  <mcstar> hehe
2011-11-04T09:24:28  <mcstar> no
2011-11-04T09:24:57  <mcstar> im just saying, you can easily write small c++ programs that take indefinitely long to compile
2011-11-04T09:25:03  <thestinger> I'm not doing anything crazy like that (yet :P)

2011-11-04T09:25:48  <mleise> mcstar: That's right. Metaprogramming can easily send a compiler into an endless loop.
2011-11-04T09:26:24  <mcstar> im only using templates for my array class
2011-11-04T09:26:25  <mleise> Like calculating all the initial paths for all map sizes from 1x1 to 200x200 :D
2011-11-04T09:26:48  <mleise> creating a multi-gigabyte executable
2011-11-04T09:27:11  <mcstar> well, you can write radius based lookups with it
2011-11-04T09:27:17  <mcstar> that is practical
2011-11-04T09:27:43  <mleise> Sure, but you can also use the 3 seconds after startup to initialize these.
2011-11-04T09:28:02  <mleise> I don't know what to do with that time anyway :)
2011-11-04T09:28:03  <mcstar> well, no
2011-11-04T09:28:19  <mleise> yes
2011-11-04T09:28:24  <mcstar> i mean using templates is not the same as initializing some array with indices
2011-11-04T09:28:45  <mleise> oh ok. what's better about templates?
2011-11-04T09:28:59  <mcstar> you store that info as CODE, not data
2011-11-04T09:29:09  <mcstar> so it can be faster
2011-11-04T09:29:15  <mcstar> can be cached differently i dont know
2011-11-04T09:29:25  <mcstar> but i can imagine there are upsides
2011-11-04T09:29:39  <mleise> Now I'm confused. How would the generated code look like?
2011-11-04T09:29:40  <mcstar> you cpu can fetch instructions more efficiently than data i guess

2011-11-04T09:30:41  <thestinger> Hexren: numpy arrays can be allocated/filled really, really quickly
2011-11-04T09:30:51  <mleise> mcstar: but you still have to select the right template instantiation at runtime
2011-11-04T09:30:58  <mcstar> but you can iterate over than really, really slowly

2011-11-04T09:31:09  <thestinger> list/array.array are much slower to allocate and there isn't a good way to fill them

2011-11-04T09:31:33  <mcstar> thestinger: how so?
2011-11-04T09:31:35  <thestinger> you don't use a python for loop
2011-11-04T09:31:38  *** Garf <Garf!~Garf@78-22-80-252.access.telenet.be> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-04T09:31:42  <mcstar> i was testing it and was slow
2011-11-04T09:31:56  <thestinger> python for loops are slow as hell in cpython
2011-11-04T09:32:00  <mcstar> yep
2011-11-04T09:32:05  <mcstar> pypy is a bit better

2011-11-04T09:32:11  <mcstar> but its numpy support is worse
2011-11-04T09:32:24  <thestinger> I think pypy is 5x faster overall, loops are probably way faster in a microbenchmark
2011-11-04T09:32:38  <mleise> mcstar: Then at runtime you select the lookup function (generated through a template) for - say view_radius2 == 55 - and use it as a function pointer or what?
2011-11-04T09:32:45  <Hexren> thestinger for what did you use numpy ?
2011-11-04T09:33:02  <thestinger> well, I was going to use it to store my 2d distance arrays
2011-11-04T09:33:16  <Hexren> i failed this morning on trying to find any kind of meaniningfull use for it :(
2011-11-04T09:33:21  <thestinger> mcstar: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.functional.html I think these are a lot faster
2011-11-04T09:33:23  <mleise> The CPU would not be able to predict the function call properly then, because it is indirect. I don't think that will work well. :)
2011-11-04T09:33:32  <mcstar> mleise: i guess you could initialize an array of function pointers, with different radii, yes
2011-11-04T09:33:56  <thestinger> there are also built-in functions for all the basics, like adding 5 to every element in an array or finding max/min/average etc.
2011-11-04T09:34:26  <mcstar> possibly
2011-11-04T09:34:31  <mcstar> i had to loop though
2011-11-04T09:34:32  <Hexren> maybe I am still sleeping but I do not see how those help me in say pathfinding
2011-11-04T09:34:42  <mcstar> and use little numpy vector operations inside
2011-11-04T09:35:03  <thestinger> yeah, as soon as you use a for loop it's going to be slow :P
2011-11-04T09:35:21  <mcstar> Hexren: if you need explicit indexing, numpy wont help very much, but it will help
2011-11-04T09:36:24  <thestinger> there are lots of ways to get around it like the functional stuff or this stuff http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.indexing.html
2011-11-04T09:37:27  <mcstar> for pathfinding i found c/c++ well suited, cause you have pointers
2011-11-04T09:37:31  <thestinger> imo, it's not worth fighting with the language implementation so I switched to C++
2011-11-04T09:38:20  <thestinger> I would rather deal with code that's ugly/verbose in comparison but has no performance problems

2011-11-04T10:08:49  <mcstar> it really feels faster
2011-11-04T10:10:04  <janzert> someone should convert engine.py to use blocking reads from the sandbox
2011-11-04T10:10:06  <dwins> over 1000 turns that would be 100 seconds - almost 2 minutes
2011-11-04T10:10:35  <janzert> I added the capability to the sandbox some time ago for it
2011-11-04T10:10:50  <mcstar> dwins: ?
2011-11-04T10:11:28  <mcstar> anyway, why its good to disable it, is that you can "feel" how fast is your bot
2011-11-04T10:11:28  <dwins> am i misinterpreting what you said? i didn't actually look at the script
2011-11-04T10:11:36  <mcstar> dwins: 10, not 100

2011-11-04T10:12:45  <janzert> and if your bot takes a randomish amount of time longer than 0.01 seconds the average increased time will be half that

2011-11-04T10:28:57  <thestinger> Fluxid: your defense is pretty neat - do you just do something like allocating a certain number of ants per hill and then having them repel each other?
2011-11-04T10:29:23  <thestinger> I'm thinking about doing something like that instead of the crappy static defense I tried
2011-11-04T10:29:24  <mcstar> Fluxid: i glad i helped if i did
2011-11-04T10:29:27  <mcstar> im*
2011-11-04T10:29:42  <Antimony> conor what's your problem?
2011-11-04T10:29:51  <Antimony> and have you read cplusplus.com?
2011-11-04T10:29:56  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-04T10:29:57  <Fluxid> mcstar: no, i detected it long time ago ;)
2011-11-04T10:30:06  <mcstar> oh

2011-11-04T10:30:32  <conor_f> I have a vector of type Ant class
2011-11-04T10:30:42  <Antimony> it just creates a 3x3 or 5x5 square around the mound
2011-11-04T10:30:46  <conor_f> and it's constructer needs 2 args
2011-11-04T10:30:46  <Antimony> but it doens't work in practice
2011-11-04T10:30:52  <Fluxid> and they just wander around in radius = 1
2011-11-04T10:31:15  <conor_f> but I can't pass them to the constructer when myAnts.push_back is called

2011-11-04T11:37:23  <mlmnl> it's true

2011-11-04T11:46:19  <mcstar> icefox: that is influence mapping
2011-11-04T11:46:27  <mcstar> its 30 years old
2011-11-04T11:46:29  <mlmnl> but it doesn't "automatically" solve the big issues
2011-11-04T11:46:31  <mcstar> or more
2011-11-04T11:46:38  <mlmnl> like map analysis etc
2011-11-04T11:46:57  <icefox> better than doing  12000 dijkstra searches  :)
2011-11-04T11:46:57  <mcstar> its a very easy way of distributing your ants
2011-11-04T11:47:10  <mcstar> there are better options
2011-11-04T11:47:19  <icefox> there are many options
2011-11-04T11:47:21  <mcstar> for example combine disjkstra with perfect matching
2011-11-04T11:47:27  <mcstar> -s
2011-11-04T11:47:38  <mlmnl> btw, why dijsktra instead of A*
2011-11-04T11:47:48  <mlmnl> A* has the same results but quicker
2011-11-04T11:47:54  <mcstar> because i can search for a condition, not a specific end location
2011-11-04T11:48:09  <mlmnl> well, I do have some of that in A* :)
2011-11-04T11:48:18  <mcstar> i did that too
2011-11-04T11:48:24  <mlmnl> like "within range of" can be doen in A*
2011-11-04T11:48:28  <mcstar> probably  i will do both for different things
2011-11-04T11:48:37  <mlmnl> or "until finding undiscovered area"
2011-11-04T11:49:06  <mcstar> for a* you have to have a heuristic, which is the manhattan distance to an end location for example
2011-11-04T11:49:18  <mlmnl> for 4-move grid
2011-11-04T11:49:20  <mcstar> if you have multiple targets, i dont see how that works
2011-11-04T11:49:22  <mlmnl> manhattan is excellent
2011-11-04T11:49:37  <mlmnl> nah, don't think you can do multi-target
2011-11-04T11:49:44  <conor_f> on ants.fluxid.pl what does the number after your name mean?
2011-11-04T11:50:01  <mcstar> mlmnl: you see, that why i say for specific things dijkstar is better
2011-11-04T11:50:06  <mcstar> at least its good enough
2011-11-04T11:50:18  <mlmnl> you have to distribute ants over  targets, then A*
2011-11-04T11:50:26  <mlmnl> so prioritize before search
2011-11-04T11:50:32  <mcstar> but on what basis?
2011-11-04T11:50:41  <mlmnl> well, that is AI :P
2011-11-04T11:50:44  <mcstar> first you have to pathfind, to get proper pat lenghts
2011-11-04T11:50:47  <Minthos> mlmnl: if the chokepoint is 3 tiles wide it should be possible to break through by sacrificing some ants
2011-11-04T11:50:50  <mcstar> path*
2011-11-04T11:51:06  <Minthos> of course you need an ai aggressive enough to actually sacrifice ants to break a position..
2011-11-04T11:51:10  <xgetc25> icefox can u provide some url to read about diffusion
2011-11-04T11:51:24  <xgetc25> u article is too complicated for me )
2011-11-04T11:51:24  <mcstar> than, you can use the hungarian algorith to make a perfect matching of ants to foods
2011-11-04T11:51:29  <xgetc25> but i think i will go that way
2011-11-04T11:51:39  <mlmnl> Minthos: at huge losses maybe

2011-11-04T11:54:23  <mlmnl> just make higher cost travel near enemy
2011-11-04T11:54:25  <nmalbran> do you diffuse 1 tile per turn?

2011-11-04T12:08:10  <Jciec> Quick question, is the bot run each step of a game or can it keep state between each step?
2011-11-04T12:08:20  <mcstar> Jciec: thats the point
2011-11-04T12:08:40  <Jciec> To keep state?
2011-11-04T12:08:45  <mcstar> i think for grand startegies you need to keep some state
2011-11-04T12:08:52  <mcstar> you can go far with a stateless bot
2011-11-04T12:09:03  <roflmao> I switched from a stateful bot to a hivemind stateless bot
2011-11-04T12:09:03  <mcstar> but the winner wont be one of those
2011-11-04T12:09:13  <roflmao> but yeah, you want SOME state
2011-11-04T12:09:22  <roflmao> generally speaking you want to keep track of food locations and enemy ant hills n stuff
2011-11-04T12:09:32  <roflmao> keeping track of food helps your food gathering immensely
2011-11-04T12:09:48  <roflmao> I actually got rid of that part in my code, need to reinstate it
2011-11-04T12:09:59  <UncleVasya> Did bocsimaco keep state?
2011-11-04T12:10:04  <mcstar> i need to "instate" it first :D
2011-11-04T12:10:16  <roflmao> its easy
2011-11-04T12:10:18  <Jciec> yeah fair. I guess i'm doing something wrong then as mine is only running one round at a time
2011-11-04T12:10:26  <UncleVasya> Or 'did.. kept' is right?
2011-11-04T12:10:32  <mcstar> did keep
2011-11-04T12:10:32  <roflmao> Jciec: well the thing is
2011-11-04T12:10:39  <praveen> My work sucks big time now. I am ready to give everything for this beautiful contest, but the question is - Is it really worth the effort?
2011-11-04T12:10:41  <roflmao> frequently ants will LOSE sight of food before they get to it
2011-11-04T12:10:41  <UncleVasya> thank
2011-11-04T12:10:46  <roflmao> if you just go with the getFood() function
2011-11-04T12:10:52  <roflmao> once you lose sight your ant will stop pursuing that food
2011-11-04T12:10:55  <mcstar> do is an auxiliary verb, you dont change the other verb in any way
2011-11-04T12:10:58  <roflmao> so it is good to keep a global cache and remember the positions
2011-11-04T12:11:04  <roflmao> but, of course, you gotta do the cleanup as well

2011-11-04T12:17:53  <roflmao> you want your ants to explore the map to find food
2011-11-04T12:18:00  <roflmao> which creates more explorers and finds more food and so on and so forth
2011-11-04T12:18:12  <roflmao> are you familiar with BFS?
2011-11-04T12:18:12  <conor_f> ok, so I need to explore better
2011-11-04T12:18:15  <conor_f> yes
2011-11-04T12:18:25  <mcstar> conor_f: you have to explore the map very fast in your voronoi region
2011-11-04T12:18:26  <roflmao> do a BFS map using the unexplored nodes as your starting open set

2011-11-04T12:19:25  <roflmao> there are probably other ways but that one works pretty well
2011-11-04T12:19:37  <praveen> roflmao: thats a neat trick to sprad them

2011-11-04T12:19:58  <conor_f> ok. I never implemented a BFS in code though, just first reaction will I need a linked list or something to keep track of nodes?

2011-11-04T12:21:25  <mcstar> roflmao: i think it could be faster right at the start if you'd use unseen there too
2011-11-04T12:21:28  <mcstar> dont you think?
2011-11-04T12:21:49  <roflmao> faster for exploring or perf wise?
2011-11-04T12:21:54  <userjjb> The C++ starter package seems to use vectors instead of arrays, why is that?
2011-11-04T12:22:03  <conor_f> I'm really happy that I made a new ant class and layed everything out differently

2011-11-04T12:29:51  <Fluxid> yup

2011-11-04T12:30:28  <Fluxid> and if on server is python2.7, there for sure is no psyco
2011-11-04T12:30:29  <conor_f> and Fluxid, good job :) saved the day for everybody :P
2011-11-04T12:30:31  <amstan> but i was assuming there's some magic when you import pypy, which takes all the code the cpython was trying to execute and pass it to pypy
2011-11-04T12:31:03  <Fluxid> amstan: there were hacks like this
2011-11-04T12:31:15  <Fluxid> someone implemented function decorator

2011-11-04T12:33:50  <conor_f> has anyone changed the distance method so that it calculates the distance manhattan method or am I overlooking some awful side effects?

2011-11-04T12:34:27  <Fluxid> because pypy is written in python itself, and uses different gc and stuff, they don't recommend it because simulating cpython api is much slower

2011-11-04T12:34:37  <thestinger> yeah

2011-11-04T12:34:51  <thestinger> they are redoing the CPython interface stuff in rpython at least, maybe the rest too?

2011-11-04T12:35:52  <Antimony> How am I incorrect?
2011-11-04T12:36:03  <Fluxid> so you can do calls to C and C++ from pypy
2011-11-04T12:36:04  <mcstar> why so you think manhatten is euclidean ^2?
2011-11-04T12:36:07  <mcstar> do*
2011-11-04T12:36:09  <Antimony> no
2011-11-04T12:36:15  <Antimony> I said to creaet a new function
2011-11-04T12:36:21  <amstan> Fluxid: i just think that it would be a lot easier to adopt pypy if all python extensions worked with it
2011-11-04T12:36:21  <thestinger> amstan: they do have the cpython interface implemented, but they would have to use the same garbage collection/memory model and the same global interpreter lock from python to make it fast - so pypy wouldn't be fast
2011-11-04T12:36:25  <Antimony> obviously stuff using euclidean distance needs to use euclidean
2011-11-04T12:36:44  <mcstar> Antimony: you dont get tha manhattan distance by removing the sqrt
2011-11-04T12:36:50  <thestinger> cpython extensions rely on the GIL to work

2011-11-04T12:37:19  <amstan> thestinger: yes, but let's say you're trying to compute primes in your program, you would be better off using a cpython module that might be slow to call than implementing the code in pypy
2011-11-04T12:37:19  <Antimony>         dr = min(d1, rows-d1),
2011-11-04T12:37:21  <Antimony>         dc = min(d2, cols-d2);
2011-11-04T12:37:23  <Antimony>     return dr+dc;
2011-11-04T12:37:23  <conor_f> it's easy to get manhatten distance, I just don't want to mess anything up by accident
2011-11-04T12:37:24  <Fluxid> amstan: yeah, but cpython c api backend need to simulate lots of stuff pypy doesn't have, because there is no need for it
2011-11-04T12:37:25  <Antimony> };
2011-11-04T12:37:27  <Antimony> I did implement it correctly, I just had a slip of mind
2011-11-04T12:37:27  <Fluxid> Antimony: use nopaste
2011-11-04T12:37:28  <nmalbran_> mcstar: at least in python, the distance function calculate manhaten distance by default..
2011-11-04T12:37:29  <amstan> Antimony: don't paste stuff in here
2011-11-04T12:37:33  <Antimony> oh sorry
2011-11-04T12:38:05  <Fluxid> amstan: computing primes in pypy may be as fast as in native c
2011-11-04T12:38:08  <conor_f> lol, so no side-effects?
2011-11-04T12:38:13  <thestinger> amstan: yeah, right now it would be faster - but you would be limited to essentially single threaded code
2011-11-04T12:38:19  <Fluxid> amstan: so there would be no need to call C ;)
2011-11-04T12:38:20  <thestinger> in the future it's not a sustainable model

2011-11-04T12:42:57  <mcstar> i see
2011-11-04T12:43:00  <amstan> roflmao: A*?
2011-11-04T12:43:20  <Antimony> if you have a specific goal that's far away, then something like A* + jump point pruning would probably be best
2011-11-04T12:43:43  <mcstar> yeah, a* prunes like hell if your heuristics is close to correct
2011-11-04T12:43:44  <Antimony> when goals are numerous, BFS works well

2011-11-04T12:44:54  <roflmao> yes, if you have one target and one objective a* beats BFS
2011-11-04T12:45:00  <roflmao> but since you have hundreds of ants
2011-11-04T12:45:02  <mcstar> amstan: it is called weighted a*
2011-11-04T12:45:03  <amstan> oh, ic, ok
2011-11-04T12:45:09  <roflmao> computing one global BFS map is better than doing hundreds of a*'s
2011-11-04T12:45:10  <icefox> roflmao: if we made a very basic bfs python bot do you think we could get it included with the stock sample_bots?

2011-11-04T12:46:01  <thestinger> the python bot had it replaced with better code, but it's still in the C++ one at least

2011-11-04T12:46:15  <amstan> icefox: the starter bots shouldn't provide strategies, it is left for the contestant to figure it out

2011-11-04T12:46:56  <UncleVasya> starter bots != sample bots

2011-11-04T12:46:57  <thestinger> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp/State.cc#L75 that's a perfectly good BFS implementation
2011-11-04T12:47:06  <amstan> if you put BFS they'll just quit because they have no idea what it does
2011-11-04T12:47:34  <roflmao> right now my biggest problem with development is that I don't have good local starter bots
2011-11-04T12:47:41  <roflmao> so I'm kind of developing strats in the blind
2011-11-04T12:47:50  <thestinger> make your bot play against versions of itself :)
2011-11-04T12:47:52  <icefox> hmm a folder of starter_bots that a documented etc might be worth it

2011-11-04T12:48:02  <roflmao> thestinger: yeah, but still, it's my mind and strategies :P
2011-11-04T12:48:22  <mcstar> Fluxid: i dont get this password part
2011-11-04T12:48:25  <roflmao> thestringer: sometimes you might think you are improving your bot when in reality you're just improving it against a particular enemy bot
2011-11-04T12:48:27  <mcstar> i used password
2011-11-04T12:48:28  <Antimony> If it's 32 bit Windows, I could try sending a compiled version of my bot, as long as you promise not to reverse engineer it
2011-11-04T12:48:34  <mcstar> but it seems it worked
2011-11-04T12:48:41  <roflmao> thestinger: but then someone else comes along with a radically different strategy and pokes holes in your "new and improved" bot :P
2011-11-04T12:48:43  <thestinger> roflmao: yeah, that's why tcp is nice
2011-11-04T12:48:49  <amstan> Antimony: or you're evil and want to send everyone trojans to steal their bot
2011-11-04T12:48:56  <Antimony> lol
2011-11-04T12:49:05  <roflmao> yep ^^, I gotta streamline my jar packaging so I can easily push my new changes to TCP
2011-11-04T12:49:07  <Antimony> I was trying to be helpful
2011-11-04T12:49:12  <amstan> Antimony: sure, lol
2011-11-04T12:49:26  <amstan> Antimony: i'm not saying not to do it

2011-11-04T12:50:43  <roflmao> aight — does anyone have any suggestions for implementing an enemy ant repelling piece of functionality?
2011-11-04T12:50:52  <roflmao> I was thinking of a negative weighted BFS map
2011-11-04T12:50:56  <Antimony> I'm still trying ot figure that out myself
2011-11-04T12:51:00  <roflmao> but it's a little too global
2011-11-04T12:51:09  <roflmao> I mean it does repel enemy ants but it repels them from extreeemely far away
2011-11-04T12:51:24  <roflmao> maybe adding a max cap to the cost
2011-11-04T12:51:39  <roflmao> ah! I think I know what I'll do
2011-11-04T12:51:52  <roflmao> just use a −1 cost for a small radius around each enemy ant
2011-11-04T12:52:00  <roflmao> or −2 or whatever
2011-11-04T12:52:33  <mcstar>                 if(obj_array[row][col] > 0)
2011-11-04T12:52:34  <mcstar>                     (*arS)[row][col] = 10;
2011-11-04T12:52:45  <mcstar> that repels
2011-11-04T12:52:53  <roflmao> what's arS?
2011-11-04T12:53:01  <Antimony> by the way, if you're on C++, I'd recommend using a custom wrapper isntead of a 2d array
2011-11-04T12:53:04  <mcstar> pointer to an array class
2011-11-04T12:53:06  <Antimony> it's much cleaner
2011-11-04T12:53:17  <Antimony> and you can use operator overloading
2011-11-04T12:53:53  <mcstar> hopps

2011-11-04T14:05:55  <mcstar> theres much uneeded info in it
2011-11-04T14:06:00  <mcstar> but the maps look good

2011-11-04T14:06:34  <conor_f> tyvm
2011-11-04T14:06:49  <conor_f> in your opinion, is it harder to implement the BFS?
2011-11-04T14:07:12  <conor_f> nvm :P reading the article
2011-11-04T14:07:18  <mcstar> you will need some kind of graph search
2011-11-04T14:07:28  <mcstar> but i wouldnt use it for this purpose
2011-11-04T14:07:43  <mcstar> but you have many possibilities
2011-11-04T14:07:54  <mcstar> probably the best answer is to try it for yourslef

2011-11-04T14:21:53  <conor_f> pedrosorio: I'm a bit confused as to how I'd implement it though. I understand it and how it works, but putting it into code is hard for me :/ I'll read about this type of mapping first, then try to see where I stand
2011-11-04T14:22:12  <pedrosorio> conor_f what language do you use?
2011-11-04T14:22:37  <conor_f> C++
2011-11-04T14:22:47  <pedrosorio> same as me :)
2011-11-04T14:22:53  <conor_f> did you use BFS?
2011-11-04T14:22:57  <pedrosorio> you can use the STL queue
2011-11-04T14:23:04  <pedrosorio> to implement BFS

2011-11-04T14:24:20  <conor_f> ..
2011-11-04T14:24:24  <pedrosorio> typically you can view the BFS as an algorithm where you take a node

2011-11-04T14:24:51  <pedrosorio> and then you process the first node of the queue
2011-11-04T14:25:04  <mcstar> and its better for reuse
2011-11-04T14:25:05  <pedrosorio> this is the basic idea of the BFS
2011-11-04T14:25:08  <underlord> but simple neat code!
2011-11-04T14:25:10  <pedrosorio> to process the closest nodes first
2011-11-04T14:25:16  <conor_f> yeah, I understand BFS
2011-11-04T14:25:21  <pedrosorio> what mcstar is saying
2011-11-04T14:25:29  <pedrosorio> is that you can do it in a much easier way
2011-11-04T14:25:36  <conor_f> but how I put it into code is what I'm asking
2011-11-04T14:25:45  <pedrosorio> a 2D array
2011-11-04T14:25:45  <pedrosorio> if you use in this game
2011-11-04T14:25:52  <conor_f> as some people might realise, I'm not the best coder in the world :P
2011-11-04T14:26:04  <pedrosorio> you simply have to store in each element of the 2D array

2011-11-04T14:29:31  <pedrosorio> xD
2011-11-04T14:29:43  <pedrosorio> how do you implement a bfs without a queue mcstar?

2011-11-04T14:30:07  <pedrosorio> ahah
2011-11-04T14:30:10  <mcstar> pedrosorio: i said i dont have an stl queue
2011-11-04T14:30:11  <pedrosorio> okok no STL queue
2011-11-04T14:30:16  <pedrosorio> do you really think
2011-11-04T14:30:24  <pedrosorio> xD
2011-11-04T14:30:27  <pedrosorio> that's the significant bottleneck?
2011-11-04T14:30:30  <underlord> conor_f: do you not find it confusing that you have to remember to transpose your information when inputting and ouputting it?
2011-11-04T14:30:36  <mcstar> i have my queue class, and its an array that is a ring-queue
2011-11-04T14:30:48  <pedrosorio> yes

2011-11-04T14:30:58  <pedrosorio> so STL is pointless for you?
2011-11-04T14:31:10  <pedrosorio> I prefer to not rewrite that which doesn't need to be rewritten
2011-11-04T14:31:19  <mcstar> pedrosorio: you can sort of f up your algorithm, for example if you use fibonacci based priority queues with a*
2011-11-04T14:31:21  <pedrosorio> and the STL queue is a good case of that
2011-11-04T14:31:24  <conor_f> underlord: no, I think that way anyways, the minute I see array/vector I think chessboard style lol

2011-11-04T14:32:11  <underlord> mcstar: should i really be worried about stl queues?
2011-11-04T14:32:15  <mcstar> we were talking about bfs
2011-11-04T14:32:16  *** underlord is now known as antimatroid
2011-11-04T14:32:20  <pedrosorio> priority queues are a whole different subject
2011-11-04T14:32:21  <antimatroid> i forgot about that :P
2011-11-04T14:32:23  <pedrosorio> but a simple queue
2011-11-04T14:32:30  <mcstar> antimatroid: you should benchmark it
2011-11-04T14:32:48  <pedrosorio> STL does it pretty well as far as I'm concerned
2011-11-04T14:32:52  <conor_f> Ok, I really just want to get some sort of exploration going here. the easiest to implement according to people is BFS. amirite?
2011-11-04T14:32:53  <antimatroid> i don't even know how to benchmark stuff properly, or do i literally just come up with an example and keep a history of times?
2011-11-04T14:32:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: if stl priques are heap based, than it might slow you down
2011-11-04T14:33:20  <mcstar> they become efficient for much larher sizes
2011-11-04T14:33:36  <mcstar> i was benchmarking 5 different prique implementations in common lisp
2011-11-04T14:33:49  <mcstar> and those are usually fast, good codes
2011-11-04T14:33:55  <mcstar> comparable to c++
2011-11-04T14:34:01  <antimatroid> conor_f: yeah, just add the target location to a queue and mark the location as added, while source has not been found take the first location off the queue, for each neighbour if it's not the source and has not been added, add it to the queue and mark it as added, otherwise if it is the source then the source wants to move into the square you just found it from..
2011-11-04T14:34:15  <pedrosorio> what is the fastest priority queue for a small number of nodes typically, mcstar?
2011-11-04T14:34:28  <antimatroid> mcstar: i have no idea what they do, although i know they store priques in a vector?
2011-11-04T14:34:52  <antimatroid> i have a very very poor understanding of lower level stuff
2011-11-04T14:35:45  <mcstar> pedrosorio: i found the fastest is to use simple lists and insert elements appropriately
2011-11-04T14:35:57  <pedrosorio> :O
2011-11-04T14:35:58  <mcstar> in common lisp a linked list is your basic data structure
2011-11-04T14:36:04  <pedrosorio> aaaaaaaaah
2011-11-04T14:36:10  <pedrosorio> but would that hold for c++?
2011-11-04T14:36:12  <conor_f> but antimatroid, where is my destination? The nearest non-explored location. but how do I find that? Just have the if() condition for the target location if(location.not_found())
2011-11-04T14:36:18  <mcstar> it could
2011-11-04T14:36:38  <antimatroid> conor_f: you might take a food location as a target for example and find the shortest path from an ant
2011-11-04T14:36:38  <mcstar> depends how many elements are in the prique, and what is the implementation of it
2011-11-04T14:36:44  <antimatroid> and move that ant towards the food location
2011-11-04T14:36:45  <mcstar> thats why im saying you need benchamrking
2011-11-04T14:36:58  <pedrosorio> I guess the limiting behaviour analysis they teach you in algorithms courses is just a lie
2011-11-04T14:36:59  <pedrosorio> :(
2011-11-04T14:37:00  <pedrosorio> xD
2011-11-04T14:37:14  <pedrosorio> (probably worth it if you work at google, though)
2011-11-04T14:37:23  <conor_f> antimatroid: so this isn't just for exploring, also for getting directions form a to b?
2011-11-04T14:37:41  <pedrosorio> conor_f: definitely
2011-11-04T14:37:47  <antimatroid> pretty much
2011-11-04T14:37:50  <conor_f> ok
2011-11-04T14:37:51  <pedrosorio> conor_f: right now all my ants do is BFS
2011-11-04T14:37:56  <mcstar> well, you cant avoid profiling in the end, but it helps if you know the space-time characteristics of your algorithsm
2011-11-04T14:37:57  <conor_f> I'll try I suppose
2011-11-04T14:38:25  <antimatroid> if you want to find unsearched locations, search from the ant till you find unexplored land, but you will need to mark which direction the ant had to move for each location in the search queue
2011-11-04T14:39:02  <antimatroid> you can also for example add all food locations to your search queue and find the shortest path from an ant to a food square and iteratively collect all the food items like that
2011-11-04T14:39:28  <mcstar> http://pastebin.com/HQcpqJh5
2011-11-04T14:39:35  <mcstar> this is my queue
2011-11-04T14:39:35  <antimatroid> that way you collect the food closest to your ants first

2011-11-04T14:48:00  <pedrosorio> and you have 300 ants
2011-11-04T14:48:04  <isbric> the sulution shuld be realy simple though, just alculate diffrent resulution maps to let a* work on.

2011-11-04T14:48:10  <pedrosorio> problems*
2011-11-04T14:48:23  <pedrosorio> and you should remember that 300 ants work much better if they are blocking something

2011-11-04T14:49:00  <isbric> yeah, well there realy is no need to do A* on ful resolution on more then the nerest 8 by 8 sqares, the rest can be zone calculated.

2011-11-04T15:11:36  <nmalbran_> yes, i think so...
2011-11-04T15:11:40  <jix> what does happen when you and an enemy gather food at the same time?
2011-11-04T15:11:51  <jix> (the same food)
2011-11-04T15:11:56  <mcstar> what i meant by counting, you count the amount of food you eat
2011-11-04T15:12:08  <mcstar> they dont
2011-11-04T15:12:08  <avdg> food get destroyed
2011-11-04T15:12:16  <nmalbran_> i was thinking on counting food colected... and remove them when an ant leave the hill
2011-11-04T15:12:50  <mcstar> yep, you have the number in a given turn, you have it in another, turn, you know how many have died
2011-11-04T15:13:03  <mcstar> figure it out how many didnt spawn
2011-11-04T15:13:11  <mcstar> thats the amount left in the hill
2011-11-04T15:13:53  <nmalbran_> good idea :d im trying that, thanks

2011-11-04T15:22:19  <hjax> i figured out what caused my code to crash after it got its first food :D, finally
2011-11-04T15:24:12  <hjax> woot, running on tcp server
2011-11-04T15:24:45  <userjjb> I'm confused about the order of expected input/output, the tutorial doesn't show the input and output together sequentially. Input: turn 0, various game variables, ready What is it waiting for me to say to continue? It just times out
2011-11-04T15:25:20  <hjax> you have to add go at the end
2011-11-04T15:25:37  <dwins> print a single line that says 'go' after doing whatever setup you want to do in response to the game parameters
2011-11-04T15:25:47  <userjjb> hmm I did that

2011-11-04T15:26:29  <userjjb> Just to test I just had it continually say go regardless so it would just loop through all the turns and my bot wouldn't do anything
2011-11-04T15:26:37  <nmalbran_> mcstar: didnt work... the currents ants doesnt include ants traped in hills...
2011-11-04T15:26:55  <mcstar> no
2011-11-04T15:26:59  <mcstar> i didnt say it will
2011-11-04T15:27:16  <mcstar> you can only see spawned ants
2011-11-04T15:27:21  <a1k0n> you have to keep track of every food you ate, and the least-recently-spawned hill
2011-11-04T15:27:21  <hjax> exponential growth code doesn't work on mazes, uh oh
2011-11-04T15:27:22  <mcstar> not the buffered ones
2011-11-04T15:27:33  <nmalbran_> so.... now im trying on counting food collected.
2011-11-04T15:27:34  <hjax> heres why i need pathfinding http://213.88.39.97:2080/replay.9708
2011-11-04T15:27:49  <mcstar> nmalbran_: "what i meant by counting, you count the amount of food you eat"
2011-11-04T15:28:19  <userjjb> std::cout<<"go" is the correct format right?
2011-11-04T15:28:41  <ikaros> no
2011-11-04T15:28:44  <ikaros> with << endl
2011-11-04T15:28:46  <ikaros> i guess
2011-11-04T15:28:46  <mcstar> hjax: exponential growh is hindered by the ants spawning from a single location
2011-11-04T15:28:49  <userjjb> ah
2011-11-04T15:29:01  <mcstar> it doenst look exponential since they introduced hills
2011-11-04T15:29:30  <pedrosorio> exponential growth code?
2011-11-04T15:29:32  <hjax> mcstar, thats true actually, lets say that my exploration code doesnt work then
2011-11-04T15:29:58  <ikaros> if (collected_food/no_of_own_hills) > (max_turns - turn) then never collect food again :)
2011-11-04T15:29:58  <userjjb> ikaros: thanks that did it, I forgot I had to flush it out
2011-11-04T15:30:07  <ikaros> hehe np
2011-11-04T15:30:39  <hjax> pedrosorio, i am sending ants that don't have anything to do away from the hill to look for more food, well its not working

2011-11-04T15:31:58  <hjax> up down up down etc
2011-11-04T15:32:02  <pedrosorio> so perhaps you need to check what you are telling them to do
2011-11-04T15:32:15  <pedrosorio> if you are processing them in one turn
2011-11-04T15:32:21  <pedrosorio> and in the next turn
2011-11-04T15:32:35  <pedrosorio> your code gives them the opposite order...

2011-11-04T15:33:10  <ikaros> hjax, you have no randomness there right? so they just go up until they cant and then go down?
2011-11-04T15:33:13  <mcstar> if hjax is hjax than he will figure it out
2011-11-04T15:33:29  <hjax> mcstar: what do you mean by that?

2011-11-04T16:23:47  <LouisMartin> You need to keep the route in memory and only recalculate them if they're broken (if (can't make the next move because farther from 1 tile) reprocess path)

2011-11-04T16:26:38  <LouisMartin> if it does, I cache even more: if I can't make the next move, I recalculate on the moves from where the ant is to where the path begins, and save a bunch on my gecko insurance

2011-11-04T16:41:12  <LouisMartin> mcstar: Could be many things. One could be the language it's implemented into (compilation vs interpretation). Our computers could be of different processing power. The code I have is a beautiful thing and it probably count for a lot even though I couldn't tell you exactly what are the tricks and optimizations has I didn't wrote that part.

2011-11-04T16:42:28  <mcstar> and strongly typed

2011-11-04T16:55:57  <foRei> LouisMartin I downloaded the C# Starter package. Im trying to get intelli-sense in Visual Studio to work. I think it is "broken" because the files are not linked together in a project
2011-11-04T16:55:57  <mcstar> i asked LouisMartin what is HIS opinion about it, in the light of his previous comment
2011-11-04T16:56:34  <LouisMartin> amstan: Haskell is even higher on my list to learn as I feel I could benefit from getting into the functional paradigm
2011-11-04T16:56:42  <mcstar> its interesting to see the "transmutation" of ideas, in a written medium :D
2011-11-04T16:56:59  <pairofdice> If I run out of stupid mistakes to do in Python I'll look into other languages

2011-11-04T16:59:43  <foRei> LouisMartin, no I've done some stuff, but Im afraid to break the starter package by adding the files into a new project... I just tried to do that, it makes intelli-sense work
2011-11-04T16:59:57  <LouisMartin> foRei: I'm not answering your question eh?  okay, so here's the answer: you need to create a new C#  CONSOLE project. Then get rid of class1.cs and add the starter pack files to the root of your project with "Add existing files"
2011-11-04T17:00:16  <foRei> Ah right, I just did that, thanks =)

2011-11-04T17:02:01  <LouisMartin> foRei: One last thing: As the guide line indicate, don't change the name of the file MyBot.cs   (not sure about changing the class name of MyBot..)

2011-11-04T17:47:11  <LouisMartin> In focus battle resolution, how are water tiles influencing the outcome?  Is this as simple as - no matter the distance - there's not focus in effect between 2 ants if those 2 ants has a clear way between them?
2011-11-04T17:48:08  <LouisMartin> Then one would only need to check if a unobstructed ray can be traced between those 2 ants to determine if there's a focus between them?

2011-11-04T18:16:20  <mcstar> conor_f: sry, with 2 parameters, you have 2 iterators, in this case pointers
2011-11-04T18:16:25  <mcstar> in an int array
2011-11-04T18:16:32  <roflmao> I have the best bot in my country
2011-11-04T18:16:37  <roflmao> I guess that's something to be proud of :P
2011-11-04T18:16:37  <Fluxid> today i've got 7 games, cool
2011-11-04T18:16:50  <mcstar> and the vector is initialized with the elements between them, inclusive, exclusive
2011-11-04T18:17:00  <Fluxid> last time three games within three minutes, lol
2011-11-04T18:17:10  <Fluxid> no, four within 20 minutes

2011-11-04T18:17:54  <mcstar> conor_f: sry again, i see you can initialize with non-iterator types
2011-11-04T18:18:04  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-04T18:18:50  <mcstar> conor_f: i will try a 2d vector, 1 sec
2011-11-04T18:19:22  <conor_f> so how come vector<vector<int> > foo(1, vector<int>(2, 0)); is valid while vector<vector<int> > foo(bar, vector<int>(foobar, 0)); is invalid?
2011-11-04T18:20:39  <Zao> mcstar: There's a ctor for N,default too.
2011-11-04T18:20:53  <Zao> mcstar: If your parameters are ambigious enough though, that'll kind of fail miserably.
2011-11-04T18:21:22  <Zao> conor_f: Sizes are not int.
2011-11-04T18:21:26  <Zao> Int, for one, is signed.
2011-11-04T18:21:30  <Zao> Sizes aren't :D
2011-11-04T18:21:54  <conor_f> so if I cast them to (signed), would it work?

2011-11-04T18:27:16  <mcstar> with c++11 you can use >> btw
2011-11-04T18:27:28  <jix> amstan: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/pull/353 or something on github? (I haven't used github much)
2011-11-04T18:27:38  <thestinger> and you can use 'for (auto it = vec.begin; ...'
2011-11-04T18:27:43  <mcstar> yep :D
2011-11-04T18:27:44  <conor_f> Zao knows I think, but he won't say whats wrong with it beyond saying sizes are not ints

2011-11-04T18:28:05  <ecarpenter84> what is the fastest data structure in python for keeping a graph of the whole map in ants?
2011-11-04T18:28:12  <mcstar> Zao: i always use void
2011-11-04T18:28:14  <ecarpenter84> i need to be able to check if items are in the graph already
2011-11-04T18:28:19  <mcstar> it is romantic
2011-11-04T18:28:23  <Zao> conor_f: I don't know what's wrong in your particular case, as you have not provided a non-compiling standalone test case.
2011-11-04T18:28:25  <jix> amstan: From what I read it should be, but I don't know how to check

2011-11-04T18:29:17  <Zao> paulwal: If you rely on it, I would recommend that you buffer up the input and analyze it in whatever order you like.
2011-11-04T18:29:20  <amstan> jix: when sure, ping janzert about it, he has to update the workers with the change

2011-11-04T18:29:22  <Zao> mcstar: "historical reasons"
2011-11-04T18:29:35  <conor_f> I'll try to make it fail again in a separate file
2011-11-04T18:29:37  <Zao> conor_f: Part of finding things out is reducing the problem to its essence.
2011-11-04T18:29:41  <conor_f> yeah
2011-11-04T18:29:44  <Zao> conor_f: If your test case doesn't fail, find the differences.

2011-11-04T18:30:01  <conor_f> that's what I tried to do, but failed at spot the difference too :/

2011-11-04T18:32:00  <LouisMartin> Regarding angle computing, I currently used Atan2 and multiply it to get Degrees rather than Rad. Is there a way to get rid of the negatives and get the angle in 0 to 360 degrees?

2011-11-04T18:32:47  <pairofdice> Angles in ants? Why?
2011-11-04T18:32:53  <mcstar> no reason
2011-11-04T18:33:00  <LouisMartin> let me try.
2011-11-04T18:33:05  <mcstar> maybe he meant Angels?
2011-11-04T18:33:16  <mcstar> the famous Atan2 Angles
2011-11-04T18:33:40  <pairofdice> Those damned obtuse angels
2011-11-04T18:33:45  <LouisMartin> High level intelligence, far away from low level behaviours.
2011-11-04T18:34:01  <Zao> LouisMartin: (x+360)%360
2011-11-04T18:34:14  <mcstar> ?
2011-11-04T18:34:14  <Zao> LouisMartin: Or, considering that you might be using *shudder* floating point, fmod.
2011-11-04T18:34:18  <pairofdice> Sure, but you can only move in 90 degree angles....
2011-11-04T18:34:22  <mcstar> why +360?
2011-11-04T18:34:36  <Zao> mcstar: To get around that % and fmod semantics with negative numbers are ... amusing.
2011-11-04T18:34:50  <Zao> mcstar: He wanted positive angles, and adding pi would put him half a circle off.
2011-11-04T18:34:55  <mcstar> atan2 return a float between [-Pi, pi)
2011-11-04T18:35:01  <mcstar> returns*
2011-11-04T18:35:03  <Zao> mcstar: He converted to degress, he said.
2011-11-04T18:35:12  <mcstar> so that is 180°
2011-11-04T18:35:42  <Zao> mcstar: Adding pi to your would rotate the angle denoted by 0 by pi.
2011-11-04T18:35:57  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-04T18:36:06  <mcstar> have trouble parsing your output
2011-11-04T18:36:20  <Zao> I interpret his request that he wants to fold it over such that 0 starts at the same place, but goes past pi up to 2pi.

2011-11-04T18:37:17  <LouisMartin> what I have is   0 to 180 by positves (45, 90 135)  and 0 to 180 in negatives (-45, -90, -135) .. but I'd prefer 0 to 360 deg.   we can get rid of atan2 or anything else, I don't care

2011-11-04T18:37:55  <LouisMartin> Zao is correct about what I want.
2011-11-04T18:38:00  <mcstar> i mean you should cast to unsigned if it had matter
2011-11-04T18:38:16  <conor_f> Oh, I thought Zao said to cast to signed

2011-11-04T18:38:48  <conor_f> heh, true >_<
2011-11-04T18:39:01  <LouisMartin> Given an Ant, 0 would be at is left, 90 at the top, 180 at his right and 270 down.   (or the other way around, 270, 170, 90 .. I also don't care about that)
2011-11-04T18:39:02  <mcstar> but in practice it doesnt matter unless you give a negative dimension to the constructor
2011-11-04T18:39:06  <Zao> LouisMartin: Say that you have 90 and -90, and you add 360 to them.

2011-11-04T18:52:30  <LouisMartin> here's a simple problem where I can see a use for angle:  How to determine if an enemy ant is Up, Down, Left or Right to you. That is,  is it More Left than Up? etc. brb
2011-11-04T18:52:34  <amstan> janzert: so we use the wall time for killing the bots?
2011-11-04T18:52:36  <janzert> jix: let me double check then
2011-11-04T18:52:41  <janzert> amstan: right
2011-11-04T18:52:49  <janzert> always have from what I can see
2011-11-04T18:52:50  <mcstar> heh
2011-11-04T18:52:54  <amstan> janzert: ok, so we shouldn't be worrying about clock at all then
2011-11-04T18:53:05  <mcstar> i did it wo angles
2011-11-04T18:53:17  <jix> janzert: in worker_setup.py it is installed by extracting a .tgz that is downloaded using curl before so I assume it's the unmodified offical scala release
2011-11-04T18:53:19  <janzert> amstan: right the time.clock method shouldn't really be used by us anywhere
2011-11-04T18:53:24  <mcstar> and, with angles, everything breaks
2011-11-04T18:53:36  <mcstar> because you have "torus" bleh
2011-11-04T18:53:41  <jix> janzert: if that is the case the pull request I made to actually enable that plugin should work
2011-11-04T18:53:47  <janzert> jix: yeah we're using the scala-2.9.0.1.tgz from scala-lang.org
2011-11-04T18:54:23  <pairofdice> Louis, but you can do that with just coordinates.
2011-11-04T18:54:44  <janzert> jix: my main question is does it end up causing a slow down for all scala code compiled whether it uses continuations or not?
2011-11-04T18:54:51  <amstan> janzert: so why are we using wall over cpu again
2011-11-04T18:55:07  <janzert> because we can measure it more reliably
2011-11-04T18:55:08  <janzert> basically
2011-11-04T18:55:23  <jix> janzert: from what I read it should only affect code that imports the continuation package

2011-11-04T18:59:49  <paulwal> thanks
2011-11-04T19:00:23  <jix> janzert: from the scala continuation paper: What we are striving for is thus a selective CPS transform (Nielsen 2001) that is applied only where it is actually needed, and allows us to stick to a regular, stack-based runtime discipline for the majority of code. As a side effect, this by design avoids the performance problems associated with implementations of delimited continuations in terms of undelimited ones (Balat and Danvy 1997; Gasbichler and Sperber 2002).
2011-11-04T19:01:50  * mcstar wonders what that means

2011-11-04T19:03:14  <janzert> :)
2011-11-04T19:03:54  <jix> writing complex iterators (java style) without them is a huge PITA
2011-11-04T19:04:06  <LouisMartin> mcstar: no but the become when you add these relatives (1, 1) (-1, 1) (1, -1) (-1, -1) to a Y, X coords
2011-11-04T19:04:26  <pairofdice> Louis, well atleast in the python starter there's the direction method
2011-11-04T19:04:53  <jix> now I can just traverse my quadtree calling produce and that is turned into an iterator I can use with all the nice iterator stuff scala has
2011-11-04T19:04:59  <mcstar> LouisMartin: yes, you need the "images" of the coordinates
2011-11-04T19:05:09  <mcstar> you you can drop angels altogether
2011-11-04T19:05:22  <LouisMartin> pairofdice: ahah, right, but how does it help me figure out the relative position of an adversaries in order to make a defensive or aggresive move?

2011-11-04T19:07:31  <jix> mcstar: but what it does is this: you pass a function which in turn gets passed a function that represents the continuation of the program
2011-11-04T19:07:45  <jix> mcstar: and the continuation is just a function that if you call resumes the program
2011-11-04T19:08:10  <jix> mcstar: and I'm not good at explaining this...
2011-11-04T19:08:16  <mcstar> like a functional closure?

2011-11-04T19:09:24  <mcstar> interesting

2011-11-04T19:09:43  <jix> (you were using lisp right?)
2011-11-04T19:10:00  <jix> maybe that works only in scheme because lisp treats functions special doesn't it?
2011-11-04T19:10:02  <mcstar> dont you need to return a lambda than?

2011-11-04T19:11:22  <LouisMartin> pairofdice: I'll take a look at your idea. thank
2011-11-04T19:11:22  <jix> now that is ugly to write.... so if the language has continuation support... you can write normal code... but are able to get hold of the continuation wherever you want
2011-11-04T19:11:56  <jix> an example is exception handling... if you are using cps you're allways free to not call the continuation but instead return an error value, aborting the computation
2011-11-04T19:12:09  <jix> so you have control over the program flow
2011-11-04T19:12:12  <mcstar> jix: so you pass a function that will be called with the result of the continuation
2011-11-04T19:12:20  <pairofdice> Louis, there's also the BEHIND dictionary that you could use, does eactly that
2011-11-04T19:12:37  <jix> mcstar: s/continuation/computation/
2011-11-04T19:12:47  <jix> mcstar: and that function that you pass _is_ the continuation
2011-11-04T19:12:58  <mcstar> well, the real-work of the cpsadd function i meants
2011-11-04T19:12:59  <jix> because it tells the function where to continue when it's done
2011-11-04T19:13:04  <mcstar> -s
2011-11-04T19:13:12  <mcstar> k
2011-11-04T19:13:35  <mcstar> so how does this look like in scheme?
2011-11-04T19:13:50  <jix> mcstar: I have no idea.. I did very little scheme and even less common lisp
2011-11-04T19:14:00  <jix> most experience I have with this comes from haskell
2011-11-04T19:14:15  <jix> where you can implement it without needing language support which is quite cool imho
2011-11-04T19:14:19  <mcstar> afaik scheme has current-continuations or some like that

2011-11-04T19:18:57  <jix> it really depends... in haskell CPS monads are very fast
2011-11-04T19:20:21  <jix> oh you can also use them to implement coroutines
2011-11-04T19:21:36  <jix> which have so many nice applications and make code way nicer than ugly huge explicit statemachines

2011-11-04T20:14:30  <LouisMartin> savaron: Alright. Well, I think the most important (and simplest) piece of software I could share if the Client/Server code.  That is, the dummy bot that redirect everything to and from your visual debugging station.  The visual part would be up to you and I could tell you how I did what I did into my SmurfStation, but it's tightly bound to my bot, so the code is pretty useless.
2011-11-04T20:14:37  <a1k0n> should add gzip compression to the protocol
2011-11-04T20:14:50  <Migi32> a bit too late for that, I'm afraid
2011-11-04T20:14:52  <savaron> that would be great
2011-11-04T20:15:01  <a1k0n> it'd be possible to make it backward-compatible
2011-11-04T20:15:02  <Migi32> I would like it too, though

2011-11-04T20:16:03  <mcstar> a1k0n: you would need to compress on every turn
2011-11-04T20:16:10  <mcstar> that is a small sample

2011-11-04T20:16:50  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: 30 place? You mean to split the map in area and aim at controlling those areas?     'stub intereaction'?  is that the little gambling dance everyone's doing?

2011-11-04T20:18:14  <savaron> I red a great approach yesterday, someone analyzed played games from the top bots, and used a learning-algorithm to teach his bot to behave like the top bots
2011-11-04T20:18:22  <mcstar> occur*
2011-11-04T20:18:27  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: my first version i did overnight implemented only pathfinding to food/unexplored areas/to enemy hills and nothing else. this landed around 30 place
2011-11-04T20:18:32  <savaron> but I don't find the link in my history
2011-11-04T20:18:57  <LouisMartin> a1kon: compression levels won't be worth it it any way.   the numbers are compressible as they're pretty much unique to the X or Y unit and the command letters are a single letters.  Maybe I missed something about what you want to do?
2011-11-04T20:19:26  <Fluxid> next i made it so only single ants would go to single food instead of whole groups, optimized the code (it gets over 500ms around 650 ants atm) and added "dance"
2011-11-04T20:19:35  <savaron> k, got it: http://www.curiousattemptbunny.com/2011/11/cheating-at-prime-directive.html
2011-11-04T20:20:28  <mcstar> prime directive? sounds like star trek

2011-11-04T20:21:02  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: yea. A* food gathering + "Snake form" killing = rank ~400 without any form of enemy avoidance/battle.
2011-11-04T20:21:39  <a1k0n> LouisMartin: are you kidding?  a lot of numbers will repeat, as do all the command prefixes, but the entropy compression alone would shrink it a lot.  a random digit only has 3.something bits of information and its being sent in 8
2011-11-04T20:21:42  <roflmao> All my bot is missing really is enemy avoidance and I think I'll be good! after that it's just tweaking
2011-11-04T20:21:49  <savaron> LouisMartin: are you using a a*-library?
2011-11-04T20:22:23  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: I'm at that point. Is there any bad way to implement the "ground control dance"?  anything you figured that was a "Ah!" moment?
2011-11-04T20:22:49  <mcstar> fyi Wow! moment
2011-11-04T20:23:55  <LouisMartin> a1k0n: it all depends on the size of the sample. If you want to compress full games, then yes, that's worth it. But didn't I read the idea what to compress the protocol live?  if so, the space to compress is too small for any descent gain.

2011-11-04T20:26:21  <Migi32> I'm really surprised that my bot is doing this well, it's extremely simple
2011-11-04T20:26:27  <roflmao> yea migi?
2011-11-04T20:26:29  <LouisMartin> a1k0n: that's what I missed of the conversation. this is much better. may be worth it then, yes.
2011-11-04T20:26:32  <Fluxid> Migi32: i was sure you'll get to top bots for sure
2011-11-04T20:26:34  <Migi32> get food. attack hills. explore. that's it
2011-11-04T20:26:40  <roflmao> really?
2011-11-04T20:26:41  <Fluxid> said this earlier today
2011-11-04T20:26:59  <roflmao> do you use any fancy tweaked weighting or anything>?
2011-11-04T20:27:06  <roflmao> cause that's what I do but doesn't work too well
2011-11-04T20:27:10  <_flag> Do any of you guys want to go on tcp? My bot needs some practice :P
2011-11-04T20:27:19  <Fluxid> no, wait
2011-11-04T20:27:31  <Fluxid> Migi32: mu, okay, but calculated skill is still low :)
2011-11-04T20:27:32  <LouisMartin> roflmao: mcstar is my favorite troll here  :)  don't worry.    there's troll I hate, and there's that type which is fun.
2011-11-04T20:27:47  <Fluxid> i thought you're tlaking about calculated skill
2011-11-04T20:27:51  <Migi32> the way you explore is quite important though. I try to spread my ants out as much as I can.
2011-11-04T20:28:04  <Migi32> Fluxid, no, I have way to high sigma for that
2011-11-04T20:28:20  <roflmao> Migi32: I just put all unexplored tiles as open set for bfs and roll with that
2011-11-04T20:28:24  <LouisMartin> savaron: for some reason I'm missing what you write me, sorry.   Yes, I'm using A*.   (Still thinking about the debugger thing btw.)
2011-11-04T20:28:24  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: i don't use a* at all, lol
2011-11-04T20:28:25  <Migi32> it's because I resubmit often. Then it resets the ranking.
2011-11-04T20:28:54  * mcstar thanks for this, he was never called a troll before, he thinks he accepts the responsibility that comes with the title
2011-11-04T20:29:25  <Fluxid> and this dance is the hardest part, and what i came with is losely based on minimax, i think, and it appears to barely work. couldn't make it better
2011-11-04T20:29:30  <roflmao> I love it how one dumb tweak can make your bot go from failure to awesome
2011-11-04T20:29:40  <Fluxid> it's stupid, i wish i could make it another way
2011-11-04T20:30:02  <mcstar> you guys really know how to mitovate others
2011-11-04T20:30:07  <mcstar> motivate*
2011-11-04T20:31:15  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: More and more I'm figuring that I eventually disable it. You end up doing some processing that give you all the data you need to move around perfectly any way.
2011-11-04T20:31:17  <roflmao> Wow, my bot has won 2 times in a row
2011-11-04T20:31:35  <Fluxid> it's not perfect, lol
2011-11-04T20:32:36  <LouisMartin> roflmao: ain't that great?  also, from hero to zero in one little buggy change and hours to find out what it was you did to screw it all.
2011-11-04T20:32:49  <roflmao> yes
2011-11-04T20:33:05  <a1k0n> by "dance" you mean combat formations?
2011-11-04T20:33:19  <retybok_> I don't understand the attack radius rules. In this example, an attack occurs far further than in another case were two ants are closer, but no attack occurs: http://i.imgur.com/FDGtR.png
2011-11-04T20:33:41  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: I've took a look at minimax but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. I feel there should be something more "intelligent" to do if you have this extra processing time available to you.
2011-11-04T20:33:47  <a1k0n> retybok_: the attack occurs after they move
2011-11-04T20:33:55  <a1k0n> the viewer shows the little attack lines a turn too early
2011-11-04T20:34:15  <a1k0n> so in the first one, they're about to move closer.  in the second, they aren't
2011-11-04T20:34:20  <retybok_> a1k0n: but the next turn they are gone on the viewer?
2011-11-04T20:34:32  <retybok_> a1k0n: so we don't see their last move?
2011-11-04T20:34:38  <a1k0n> right... if you hit play you'll see them move and fade out simultaneously
2011-11-04T20:34:44  <a1k0n> if you use the arrows they just disappear

2011-11-04T20:37:00  <marijnfs> its infeasable for all your ants at once right?
2011-11-04T20:37:30  <retybok_> a1k0n: got it, thanks a lot.
2011-11-04T20:37:41  <a1k0n> np
2011-11-04T20:38:31  <roflmao> minimax looks fkin complicated
2011-11-04T20:40:23  <pairofdice> Why can't I get this to wooooork
2011-11-04T20:40:32  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: Minimax could well be the best way to go, hence why nobody seriously talk about anything else.
2011-11-04T20:40:49  <pairofdice> I don't think minmax is the best way
2011-11-04T20:40:56  <LouisMartin> So, Savaron, still there?
2011-11-04T20:40:58  <pairofdice> I have an idea I want to get to work
2011-11-04T20:41:11  <roflmao> what's up pair?
2011-11-04T20:41:12  <Fluxid> if no minimax, any other concept which has a name?
2011-11-04T20:41:35  <bugnuts> there is always monte carlo...
2011-11-04T20:41:36  <marijnfs> but minimax uses a lot of computation
2011-11-04T20:41:58  <marijnfs> just for chess it is hard enough, and there you just have one piece you can move at a time
2011-11-04T20:42:06  <Fluxid> my minimax tree has size of 16
2011-11-04T20:42:15  <marijnfs> maybe some monte-carlo
2011-11-04T20:42:26  <marijnfs> with some heuristic
2011-11-04T20:42:31  <pedrosorio_> size?
2011-11-04T20:42:31  <marijnfs> basically random tries
2011-11-04T20:43:05  <pairofdice> Good luck with Monte Carlo...
2011-11-04T20:43:13  <Fluxid> you mean this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm
2011-11-04T20:43:17  <pedrosorio_> even more complicated than minimax
2011-11-04T20:43:23  <LouisMartin> savaron?
2011-11-04T20:43:39  <a1k0n> Fluxid: 16.. moves?  per pair of ants?
2011-11-04T20:43:43  <pedrosorio_> I think we need to find some patterns
2011-11-04T20:43:47  <bugnuts> it's about equally complicated I think
2011-11-04T20:44:07  <pedrosorio_> symmetries
2011-11-04T20:44:07  <pedrosorio_> etc.
2011-11-04T20:44:21  <Fluxid> a1k0n: 4 directions in which *all* of my ants move * 4 directions *all* of enemy move
2011-11-04T20:44:41  <a1k0n> Fluxid: oh.. that's not minimax, that's a payoff matrix
2011-11-04T20:44:48  <Fluxid> ah
2011-11-04T20:44:54  <savaron> luizribeiro: still there ;)
2011-11-04T20:44:57  <Fluxid> well, sorry, they kicked me out of uni
2011-11-04T20:45:01  <a1k0n> heh.
2011-11-04T20:45:05  <Fluxid> :)
2011-11-04T20:45:06  <a1k0n> i dropped out myself, so there
2011-11-04T20:45:20  <a1k0n> minimax would have you go N moves into the future for each player
2011-11-04T20:45:20  <marijnfs> a payoff matrix?
2011-11-04T20:45:23  <Fluxid> so let's check what is payoff matrix
2011-11-04T20:45:57  <a1k0n> a payoff matrix is arguably a more correct thing to do here because there are simultaneous moves
2011-11-04T20:46:03  <Fluxid> ah, wait, i've read about this in paper about minimax...
2011-11-04T20:46:05  <a1k0n> this argument came up repeeatedly in tron
2011-11-04T20:46:52  <Fluxid> i missed the difference probably because i wanted more to watch movies than read science stuff
2011-11-04T20:46:58  <Fluxid> oh well

2011-11-04T20:52:26  <mcstar> you can still do minimax, just imagine as if the players move after each other
2011-11-04T20:52:43  <mcstar> the problem why you cant call it minimax, is that you can have multiple players
2011-11-04T20:52:58  <mcstar> and you cant call anymoew one player's gain another player's loss
2011-11-04T20:53:04  <mcstar> anymore*
2011-11-04T20:53:40  <ikaros> you could do something like you vs the rest
2011-11-04T20:53:54  <mcstar> thats not good enough
2011-11-04T20:54:08  <mcstar> i mean it is logically incorrect if you assume that
2011-11-04T20:54:21  <mcstar> and the smarter the other bots are, the more you are mistaken
2011-11-04T20:54:53  <ikaros> not sure about this
2011-11-04T20:55:28  <ikaros> true its logically incorrect but this doesnt need to be bad if its a working simplification
2011-11-04T20:55:45  <antimatroid> mcstar: i don't think there's much to be lost in treating it in you vs them
2011-11-04T20:55:54  <antimatroid> assuming you do your evaluation properly
2011-11-04T20:55:59  <mcstar> huh

2011-11-04T20:56:06  <mcstar> there it is
2011-11-04T20:56:12  <ikaros> ?
2011-11-04T20:56:16  <antimatroid> it as*
2011-11-04T20:56:18  <mcstar> if you do it properly you must treat them separately
2011-11-04T20:56:30  <antimatroid> not if you don't care about cooperation i don't think
2011-11-04T20:56:42  <antimatroid> but then it's probably no more expensive anyway
2011-11-04T20:57:04  <mcstar> the problem is with the branching factor and that you have many battles at once
2011-11-04T20:57:10  <mcstar> and you need to separate them
2011-11-04T20:57:18  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i wanted to do a payoff matrix in planet wars but it's way harder to generate iteratively
2011-11-04T20:57:50  <antimatroid> and you then have the problem of strategy selection for the payoff matrix
2011-11-04T20:58:05  <antimatroid> there isn't even necessarily always a pure nash equilibrium or if there is a unique one
2011-11-04T20:58:07  <mcstar> payoff tensor
2011-11-04T20:58:13  <antimatroid> well yes for this
2011-11-04T20:58:19  <antimatroid> not for planet wars
2011-11-04T20:58:32  <antimatroid> i have tensors set up in my game theory library for n player games
2011-11-04T20:58:53  <mcstar> have you figured out all the terminology yet? :D
2011-11-04T20:59:07  <antimatroid> for tensors? nah
2011-11-04T20:59:16  <antimatroid> i still don't understand wtf a tensor product is
2011-11-04T20:59:38  <mcstar> not tensors per say, but for n>2 player zero sum games
2011-11-04T20:59:53  <mcstar> hm
2011-11-04T20:59:56  <antimatroid> i used to think tensor product meant like multiplication of matrices, i realise that's completely off the mark now at least :P
2011-11-04T21:00:11  <antimatroid> yeah it's just an n-dimensional table of payoffs
2011-11-04T21:00:24  <antimatroid> it's representing the function u:A->R^n
2011-11-04T21:00:38  <antimatroid> where A is the pure strategy space and R^n is the players payoff space

2011-11-04T21:04:41  <nickjohnson> But yes - previously ants mostly spread out and did a good job of exploring
2011-11-04T21:04:44  <mcstar> i assign numbers to it

2011-11-04T21:07:57  <antimatroid> lol, we were doing jacobson radicals in ring theory this semester
2011-11-04T21:08:13  <antimatroid> then towards the end our lecturer made note that there exists abstract jacobson radical theory
2011-11-04T21:08:21  <antimatroid> and we just looked at each like wtf this isn't abstract?
2011-11-04T21:08:32  <antimatroid> each other*
2011-11-04T21:08:35  <nickjohnson> It seems plausible that the local maxima from a food item takes a while to dissipate, so they stick around for a bit, but I wouldn't expect the ants to cluster quite so much as they do
2011-11-04T21:08:40  <mcstar> you mean not on rings?
2011-11-04T21:08:42  <nickjohnson> And I'm surprised how much better it did with the 'wrong' update procedure

2011-11-04T21:09:28  <nickjohnson> lericson: Easier said than done. The diffusion is calculated across the whole playfield, there's no way to isolate one source's contribution to it

2011-11-04T22:06:01  <a1k0n> maze maps are especially evil since the distance from A to B on a 150x150 map is often more like 1500
2011-11-04T22:06:15  <a1k0n> (well, not really, but still, it's far)
2011-11-04T22:06:16  <antimatroid> amstan: i could try and just hack the make symmetric function for you for the moment?
2011-11-04T22:06:21  <antimatroid> otherwise you'll need to wait
2011-11-04T22:06:31  <antimatroid> a1k0n: :D
2011-11-04T22:06:51  <antimatroid> imagine if i made it 1 width corridors and a perfect maze
2011-11-04T22:06:57  <antimatroid> that'd make for some crazy game play

2011-11-04T22:08:47  <hjax> i think that ill just only apply bfs to a small area around the target and ant, so if it cannot connect then the nt gives up

2011-11-04T22:09:35  <burny> bfs on a 200*200 maze map should take roughly.. 1-2ms in worst case
2011-11-04T22:10:07  <burny> can be as little as about 0.1ms, for brute force optimizations

2011-11-04T22:14:01  <burny> antimony: because you still had one ant left?
2011-11-04T22:14:41  <a1k0n> you could theoretically have a super ninja ant that can take out the other guy's hill, but in any case you wouldn't get as many points

2011-11-04T22:16:53  <a1k0n> my defense strategy: one i've collected enough food i'll have a bunch of aimless ants wandering around the hive
2011-11-04T22:17:07  <a1k0n> and all the enemy ants who come to attack me i ignore and they bump into them
2011-11-04T22:17:08  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i was hoping for something more tactful :P
2011-11-04T22:17:23  <antimatroid> like setting up a perimeter around your hill where you don't actually need it to be in sight
2011-11-04T22:17:37  <antimatroid> just know that no enemy could be near it because you have a perimeter around it etc.
2011-11-04T22:17:52  <hjax_> mine: build box around hive, if ants get too close send ants to counter, as ants come out of my hill I can repair my box
2011-11-04T22:18:25  <bmh> a1k0n: you got to 21st with a bot that stupid?
2011-11-04T22:18:30  <antimatroid> same as attacking enemy hills, ideally you'd like to send ants in from all possible directions

2011-11-04T22:50:01  <lericson> antimatroid: isn't it better to find a solution generic enough that you don't need to "add battles"
2011-11-04T22:50:16  <ecarpenter84> i finally beat a decent bot
2011-11-04T22:50:18  <antimatroid> heh, good luck with that :P
2011-11-04T22:50:46  <lericson> good combat behavior: if we are many, attack - if they are more, fall back
2011-11-04T22:50:58  <lericson> so why not just have ants smell each other
2011-11-04T22:51:05  * lericson would do that if he cba'd
2011-11-04T22:51:07  <antimatroid> you're going to do better with some kind of game tree
2011-11-04T22:51:21  <antimatroid> backward induction is king
2011-11-04T22:52:41  <lericson> seems like an expensive calculation
2011-11-04T22:52:42  <LouisMartin> Regarding focus battle resolution,  bots at 3 tiles of distance (let's say on the Y axis) would kills each others while the AttackRadius2 is 5. Wouldn't 3 tiles of distances correspond to an AttackRadius2 of 9 ?
2011-11-04T22:53:09  <LouisMartin> the root of 5 is ~2.23
2011-11-04T22:53:21  <LouisMartin> does the engine round it to 3 in battle resolution?
2011-11-04T22:53:54  <antimatroid> expensive yes, better than everything else, yep :P
2011-11-04T22:54:11  <antimatroid> LouisMartin: it's picked so rounding shouldn't be an issue
2011-11-04T22:54:22  <lericson> but also backwards induction requires that you know what your opponents moves will be
2011-11-04T22:54:24  <ecarpenter84> if you can cache enough map data for a few turns. you can use your extra time for more combat analysing
2011-11-04T22:54:27  <lericson> which is a misconstrual of the problem imo :p
2011-11-04T22:54:34  <LouisMartin> Can't wait to stop asking so much questions about everything. Feels like I'm the biggest bugger in the place. .. That said, I'll gladly help others when I'll know enough...
2011-11-04T22:54:36  <ecarpenter84> its a matter of load balancing what you need to do and what you can afford to do

2011-11-04T22:58:11  <LouisMartin> antimatroid: I don't understand.   If bots at distance of 3 kill each others, how are the bots predict if a move could trigger battle or not based on the AttackRadius2 of 5 since battle apparently happens at radius2 of 9 ?

2011-11-04T23:33:15  <Rinum> python always gives +
2011-11-04T23:33:17  <ccc> so its a bug in python
