2011-10-30T00:02:42  <thestinger> ghjgghj: http://paste.pocoo.org/raw/500296/ here's an example of the 2d array 21 turns into a game on a small map
2011-10-30T00:03:06  <thestinger> -1 means water, 0 means that location is unexplored, a higher number is the distance to an explored area
2011-10-30T00:04:11  <ghjgghj> ummm, ok, so i want to move the ants to the closest 0?
2011-10-30T00:04:15  <thestinger> so, I iterate through each unexplored area (you could just pick out a few though if speed is an issue), and first I set that location to 0, then iterate outwards from there with a breadth-first search, increasing the value by 1 each time I move
2011-10-30T00:04:37  <thestinger> well, once you make a distance map like that, you can just check the value at an ant's location, and that is the distance to an unseen area
2011-10-30T00:04:57  <thestinger> and you get pathfinding for free - you just move to any of the 4 locations next to the ant that has a lower value
2011-10-30T00:05:29  <TheShagg> blech, the github is so different that it's impossible to figure out

2011-10-30T00:06:56  <ghjgghj> ok, make sense, but how do i make that map?
2011-10-30T00:08:21  <thestinger> so, you should preallocate a 2d array representing the map (rows/columns), to make a distance map for one target - set the location of the target to 0, and run a BFS search - increasing the value by 1 each time you move to a new node (and storing it in the graph)
2011-10-30T00:08:58  <thestinger> there's a working breadth-search first used by the C++ starter bot to calculate vision, but I think the python bot uses a better way now
2011-10-30T00:09:07  <thestinger> breadth-first search*
2011-10-30T00:09:53  <ghjgghj> I am still not sure what breadth-first search is
2011-10-30T00:10:15  <thestinger> https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Breadth-first_search
2011-10-30T00:10:46  <thestinger> you start at a node and search outwards to every location, never revisiting a node
2011-10-30T00:11:25  <thestinger> since you record the distance from where you started in the 2d array, you don't need to keep track of visited nodes - you just stop when a node doesn't have a lower value than the parent you came from
2011-10-30T00:11:33  <Minthos> dijkstra's algorithm is a famous example
2011-10-30T00:11:49  <thestinger> you can implement BFS in ~5 lines in python, and you can find lots of examples online

2011-10-30T00:12:04  <thestinger> most of them will probably use a dictionary of lists to represent a graph, because it adapts to any situation
2011-10-30T00:12:16  <ghjgghj> umm, ok, I get the basic ideas now, just have to do some reading, thanks a lot
2011-10-30T00:12:28  <thestinger> you'll want to code your own that uses a 2d list or array to represent the graph, and record distances in it
2011-10-30T00:13:09  <ghjgghj> ok
2011-10-30T00:14:36  <^5> Theres something I dont get, how do I actually use a search algorithm? I dont have enough time to do it per ant per turn, so how often? when?

2011-10-30T00:14:59  <thestinger> I run a bunch of breadth-first searches every turn
2011-10-30T00:15:17  *** vicky is now known as Guest53877
2011-10-30T00:15:58  <thestinger> I do one for each food (across the whole map at the moment, it's fast)
2011-10-30T00:16:50  <thestinger> and I also make a 2d vector for attacking hills and do a BFS for each enemy hill (sort of, they stop early) and the same for exploration
2011-10-30T00:17:16  <thestinger> I'm using C++ but you can do similar stuff in python, you just have to be more conservative
2011-10-30T00:17:31  <thestinger> I was having timeouts when I used A* for each ant
2011-10-30T00:18:11  <thestinger> doing a BFS gets you distances _and_ pathfinding for every location on the map to the place you started as long as you store the result somewhere

2011-10-30T03:24:08  <krishna> Meh: I'd bet an admin can unlock it for you if you remember your email address.
2011-10-30T03:24:19  <Meh> think the organizer won't mind?  It would suck to get disqualified because no one even cared to check if both accounts had submission ..
2011-10-30T03:24:43  <antimatroid1> you wont get disqualified for that, it's more than one active submission per person we don't want
2011-10-30T03:24:56  <Meh> I remember the email address for sure, but how can I ask an admin?  I don't even see an email address to write to ..
2011-10-30T03:24:58  <antimatroid1> but yeah amstan or someone else should be able to find the username if you know the email address you registered with
2011-10-30T03:25:09  <antimatroid1> amstan: are you about?

2011-10-30T03:25:54  <Meh> Well, I'm all for creating a new account anyway: Even if I can't remember the username I've used, I know for sure it wasn't one I'd like to compete under
2011-10-30T03:26:05  <antimatroid1> Meh: just do that then
2011-10-30T03:26:07  <jab_bott> mleise: yes - all that! Actually you wouldn't want the visualizer overlays to be switched on for build systems as it's a bit insecure the way I've implemented it. I could be tightened up though
2011-10-30T03:26:08  <mleise> Meh: you can probably use the user search if you know a part of your nick

2011-10-30T04:52:02  <mleise> C++ has C in the background. Its no wonder they made a distinction for dynamic casts which actually do something at runtime.

2011-10-30T05:33:09  <grom358> does the server sometimes just glitch out?

2011-10-30T05:41:36  <bysin> i've always wondered if a GC language would have problems
2011-10-30T05:42:08  <bysin> as a gen 2 GC will pause the threads for an indefinite amount of time for cleanup, it might cause a timeout
2011-10-30T05:42:13  <grom358> bysin: java
2011-10-30T05:42:24  <bysin> you think it might be that?

2011-10-30T05:42:53  <grom358> usually it like 100ms to take its turn

2011-10-30T05:53:34  <bysin> it might be for early game, but late game with 400 ants, its ~3ms per ant

2011-10-30T07:38:04  <Migi32> it's the latest playgame.py and visualizer.jar, so I don't think that's the problem

2011-10-30T08:32:10  <antimatroid1> good evening
2011-10-30T08:32:41  * antimatroid1 finds it strange that good evening is usually a greeting while good night a farewell
2011-10-30T08:33:25  <Neurosys_> I just downloaded and ran the c++ starter w/ ubuntu makefile on visual studio (with some modifications) and I was able to get it to run I was curious if anyone knew if submitting that would work ?
2011-10-30T08:33:41  <Neurosys_> I'm not even sure the ant is actually alive but its not crashing
2011-10-30T08:34:12  <Neurosys_> it just walks str8 up until it wraps around bottom and gets eaten by hunterbot
2011-10-30T08:34:28  <Neurosys_> and when i run the executable it runs.. but just a blank screen
2011-10-30T08:36:47  <emilk> submitting the starter package is OK

2011-10-30T08:45:48  <Nescio> strange - your bot should initialize then respond "go"
2011-10-30T08:46:50  <Neurosys_> im using this starter package... aichallenge.org/starter_packages/cpp_starter_package.zip  and I had to resolve problems with not having a stdint.h (grabbed from opensource also had to grab platform.h) to make it compile
2011-10-30T08:46:59  <Neurosys_> it semes to be listening but it says nothing
2011-10-30T08:47:09  <jix> according to the spec there should at least be the line "turn 0" before "ready"
2011-10-30T08:47:59  <Neurosys_> the matchs play though.. he acts dumb but i thought that was just cuz he was basic...
2011-10-30T08:48:16  <Neurosys_> then i realized he literally just moves straight upwards

2011-10-30T08:48:36  <Migi32> n4nd0, since boost is mostly a header-only library, maybe you can copy the headers you need?
2011-10-30T08:49:51  <jmcarthur> Neurosys_: yeah i think start behavior is to just try moving upward, and if you can't then keep trying other directions until you can

2011-10-30T08:50:27  <Neurosys_> k I'll try and get the lil guy to obey and see if hes really alive or just stalling out

2011-10-30T08:51:30  <n4nd0> Migi32, I can try to do that, but I am afraid that it might become too messy
2011-10-30T08:52:25  <Migi32> n4nd0: yeah, true.
2011-10-30T08:52:26  <n4nd0> Migi32, I mean, the idea is to include the files of boost that I am using in my zip file, but I have also to check what are the files that those that I am using are including
2011-10-30T08:52:43  <cowbandit> is there a method that tells you if an enemy ant is close to your ant hill?
2011-10-30T08:52:46  <n4nd0> Migi32, any better idead?
2011-10-30T08:52:50  <Migi32> I know what you mean. Boost uses a lot of headers :)
2011-10-30T08:53:51  <n4nd0> Migi32, I think I will code on my own the part I have used so far and I'll remember for later not to think of boost
2011-10-30T08:54:07  <jmcarthur> cowbandit: if you can see the enemy it will be reported to you
2011-10-30T08:54:08  <Migi32> not really. But I'm actually not sure that we can't use the boost libraries. Maybe you should ask one of the contest organizers or something.
2011-10-30T08:54:29  <Migi32> or just try it yourself :)
2011-10-30T08:54:36  <cowbandit> oi ok thx
2011-10-30T08:54:58  <jmcarthur> cowbandit: but it's up to you to figure out if it's close to a hill :)
2011-10-30T08:55:01  <n4nd0> Migi32, it looks like there is no support according to this entry of the forum http://aichallenge.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1612&p=10300&hilit=boost&sid=cf853953b81e14003dc0b3a4ceb5072a#p10300
2011-10-30T08:55:34  <cowbandit> dmcarthur: lol darn. well i just thought there was a prewritten method for it since your hill pings whenever an enemy ant gets close

2011-10-30T09:40:50  <delt0r__> so?
2011-10-30T09:40:59  <delt0r__> i use the example and it works
2011-10-30T09:41:12  <merk> in linux?
2011-10-30T09:41:16  <delt0r__> something is wrong --without more details its hard to know
2011-10-30T09:41:53  <merk> i have the latest java runtime
2011-10-30T09:41:57  <merk> and the python 3.2
2011-10-30T09:42:03  <delt0r__> also i don't let the play game thing start my browser... i just point FF to the game reply
2011-10-30T09:42:21  <delt0r__> the viewer is in JS
2011-10-30T09:42:26  <delt0r__> the node.js thing
2011-10-30T09:42:38  <merk> yes
2011-10-30T09:43:09  <delt0r__> the java thing is to wrap it IIRC --so just a bowser that supports node.js aka FF or chrome is all you need
2011-10-30T09:43:33  <merk> i have chrome and firefox
2011-10-30T09:43:42  <merk> how i make it to run in my chrome?
2011-10-30T09:43:58  <delt0r__> its just a link to the file system
2011-10-30T09:44:29  * delt0r__ plays one game
2011-10-30T09:45:44  <merk> so i have to link the java with chrome?
2011-10-30T09:45:50  <delt0r__> No
2011-10-30T09:45:53  <delt0r__> no java
2011-10-30T09:45:59  <delt0r__> java nono
2011-10-30T09:46:21  <delt0r__> sorry i can't find my ants stuff on this machine
2011-10-30T09:46:39  <delt0r__> but either way it ends up just as something like
2011-10-30T09:47:06  <delt0r__> file://myreplaysAndStuff/visuliser.js?data=whatever
2011-10-30T09:47:12  <delt0r__> something like that
2011-10-30T09:47:20  <delt0r__> then the browser only uses js
2011-10-30T09:47:37  <delt0r__> chrome has a very fast js engine

2011-10-30T09:57:03  <merk> the new vidualizer uses java
2011-10-30T09:57:04  <delt0r__> Should be a list of "turn blar blar blar"

2011-10-30T09:57:32  <delt0r__> well then there is no game to see
2011-10-30T09:57:47  <delt0r__> as i suggested right at the start
2011-10-30T09:58:31  <delt0r__> the error is before any java is run
2011-10-30T09:58:44  <delt0r__> looks like a map the size 0,0 is tried to be replayed
2011-10-30T09:58:53  <delt0r__> which is clearly wrong
2011-10-30T09:59:22  <delt0r__> so your map bit in the play one game is probably wrong or you are exeing it from the wrong directory
2011-10-30T09:59:37  <merk> must i have a directory?
2011-10-30T10:00:29  <delt0r__> on linux you are always in some directory ie the cwd or pwd
2011-10-30T10:00:39  <delt0r__> most of this stuff is a bit sensitive to that
2011-10-30T10:00:45  <delt0r__> ie where it is run from
2011-10-30T10:02:02  <merk> i am going to run it from my hard disk

2011-10-30T10:35:00  <callahan> I don't think either of them is particularly strategic though.  The ants aren't going to where they will do the most good, they just do reasonably well whereever they are.

2011-10-30T10:38:25  <antiwhack> i think xathis has a better bot than A. xathis has his ants spreading out evenly over the board, trying to stay within X of other ants.
2011-10-30T10:38:31  <antiwhack> best forr food harvesting
2011-10-30T10:38:47  <Rinum> antiwhack: but you only get points for attacking
2011-10-30T10:39:00  <antiwhack> once you have all the food, attacking comes easy
2011-10-30T10:39:05  <callahan> http://ants.fluxid.pl/player/A
2011-10-30T10:39:28  <Rinum> imo, your bot doesn't need to be that good at collecting food
2011-10-30T10:39:44  <callahan> It does for some of the maps
2011-10-30T10:40:02  <Rinum> attacking hills is the only thing that gets you points
2011-10-30T10:41:06  <Rinum> how often do games happen on fluxid?
2011-10-30T10:42:01  <antimatroid1> should happen as soon as it has enough people
2011-10-30T10:42:01  <callahan> continuously
2011-10-30T10:42:02  <Fluxid> Rinum: i think i disagree... by rewriting food gathering in my bot it suddenly started to perform better at attacking hills - because it produced more ants in shorter period of time, attacks were more massive
2011-10-30T10:42:27  <callahan> I think the fluxid maps are skewed towards particular types of ants
2011-10-30T10:42:38  <antimatroid1> lol
2011-10-30T10:42:38  <callahan> lots of low resource maps
2011-10-30T10:42:45  <callahan> and high hill count maps
2011-10-30T10:42:59  <Fluxid> maps are random imo

2011-10-30T10:53:44  <Fluxid> showed skill is mu-3*sigma
2011-10-30T10:53:50  <jbroman> For a long-form article about this: http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html which
2011-10-30T10:54:03  <Fluxid> the lower the sigma, the more certain is "real" skill - mu

2011-10-30T10:54:16  <jix> Belerafon: doing that stops someone winning by luck the first few games from ending up on #1
2011-10-30T10:54:27  <Fluxid> also the higher the sigma, the higher changes to skill are made if you fail/win

2011-10-30T10:56:23  <Fluxid> all: tcp server is down for few minutes
2011-10-30T11:01:58  <bchoii> Hi, is there documentation on how the TCP server works ? My first impression is that it pipes my bot IO to the TCP server instead of to the stdio.
2011-10-30T11:02:09  <Ionic_Groove> what are the test cases? I got a working bot but fails a test case apparantly
2011-10-30T11:02:33  <jix> Ionic_Groove: there is a shellscript in the tools package

2011-10-30T11:29:21  <callahan> I think there was a better one.  A starts covering hills to get ants to correct places.
2011-10-30T11:29:22  <bmh> ikaros: I plan on determining a polygon in which enemy ants *cannot* be and ensuring that I can get ants to my hill if the line is breached

2011-10-30T12:53:28  <Draakon> are some of those example bots causing duplicate orders and etc. errors also? it seems to me at least

2011-10-30T13:00:42  <Chirmaya> Is there any way to get a more descriptive error message about a timeout from the python tool?
2011-10-30T13:01:48  <Puj> Chirmaya, usually it depends on a crash in your bot,  you can output those crash messages using the -E flag in the playgame.py options.  You must also specify a game_logs folder to save all of the logging to.
2011-10-30T13:02:40  <Chirmaya> I have that on, but all it says is "status timeout survived"

2011-10-30T13:03:28  <Puj> So nothing from stderr indicates an exception, or runtime error?  Are you getting other stderr output?  Chirmaya?
2011-10-30T13:04:05  <Chirmaya> Yeah, I am getting it since I use that for checking my timings

2011-10-30T13:05:00  <Puj> Chirmaya, well then either you can do some very verbose output through stderr indicating, for example, the start and end points of your methods, or you can use an appropriate profiler.
2011-10-30T13:05:21  <Puj> And trying piping in the 0.bot0.input, for example.
2011-10-30T13:06:10  <Chirmaya> I have done the verbose method, but all of my times were around 100-300 ms, so I know that it isn't timing out on my end
2011-10-30T13:06:59  <burny> maybe your computer and/or compiler, are better than on live?
2011-10-30T13:07:00  <Puj> Check turntime in the playgame file, and make sure it is not set to 250ms, Chirmaya.
2011-10-30T13:07:17  <Chirmaya> Says 1000ms
2011-10-30T13:07:42  <Puj> Are you developing in Python?
2011-10-30T13:07:49  <Chirmaya> Ruby
2011-10-30T13:08:42  <Puj> I'm not sure then.  I've been experiencing some strange timeouts in Python, but I assumed that was some clash with cygwin.  Eclipse seems to work quite a bit better with the tools.
2011-10-30T13:10:23  <Chirmaya> Hmm. So maybe my Ruby believes that it times out because of a long (though not infinite loop) and sends that message to the python tool?
2011-10-30T13:11:19  <Puj> Well, the Python tool keep tracks of all of the Bots and how much time they take per turn.
2011-10-30T13:11:43  <Puj> It checks periodically if all the bots are finished and then continues when all of the bots are finished or the time limit runs out.

2011-10-30T13:42:48  <roflmao> haha
2011-10-30T13:42:56  <roflmao> I'm trying to implement a* in ruby, it works but the performance is terrible.
2011-10-30T13:43:01  <roflmao> with a manhattan heuristic estimate of 41
2011-10-30T13:43:04  <a1k0n> hm.  yep.
2011-10-30T13:43:12  <roflmao> it takes 3 seconds to find the path
2011-10-30T13:43:18  <roflmao> and I end up with 1678 nodes in the open set
2011-10-30T13:43:25  <roflmao> is that normal or ridiculously high?
2011-10-30T13:43:50  <a1k0n> sounds pretty high to me.  depends on the map obviously.
2011-10-30T13:43:50  <Minthos> pathfinding is expensive and ruby is notoriously slow
2011-10-30T13:43:58  <a1k0n> but... what minthos said
2011-10-30T13:44:07  <a1k0n> check that you're not revisiting the same node twice
2011-10-30T13:44:25  <roflmao> oh i had the forumla fucked up
2011-10-30T13:44:28  <roflmao> down to 89 open nodes

2011-10-30T13:48:18  <mleise> roflmao: All the paths in ants have the same cost. That is the problem. When you stand in a corner on an empty map and move to the center you can litterally take any path and A* checks them all.
2011-10-30T13:48:58  <roflmao> yeh :-\
2011-10-30T13:49:12  <roflmao> for heuristics (manhattan) of around 20 it works well in ants
2011-10-30T13:49:24  <roflmao> anything above 35 distance goes crazy slow cause the set of open nodes is enormous
2011-10-30T13:49:24  <a1k0n> so use an inadmissible heuristic
2011-10-30T13:49:34  <roflmao> what's that?
2011-10-30T13:49:39  <mleise> 20? You set the heuristics to a constant of 20?
2011-10-30T13:49:42  <a1k0n> something that is not an underestimate.
2011-10-30T13:49:50  <roflmao> no
2011-10-30T13:50:05  <roflmao> I'm just saying that when the ant is going to calculate a path that has an estimated manhattan distance of 20 it performs well
2011-10-30T13:50:13  <a1k0n> use 5*euclidean distance, for instance, and you'll get a path that isn't necessarily optimal but is quicker to compute.
2011-10-30T13:50:24  <mleise> a1k0n: inadmissible heuristic means he has to get nodes back from the closed set, right?

2011-10-30T13:50:48  <roflmao> one thing that helped (but didn't help enough) was that I weighted the heuristic
2011-10-30T13:51:22  <roflmao> node priority = estimated distance to food MINUS distance already travelled
2011-10-30T13:51:43  <roflmao> but, obviously, that ends up favoring long paths
2011-10-30T13:52:11  <minus> huh?
2011-10-30T13:52:22  <mleise> You can get rid of the "open nodes with equal value" by using a tie-breaker
2011-10-30T13:52:36  <lavalamp> roflmao: shouldn't it be (distance traveled + estimated remaining)?

2011-10-30T13:53:49  <a1k0n> but.. you've messed up the definition of path cost
2011-10-30T13:54:18  <mleise> The range of the tie-breaker must remain a fraction of the cost (i.e. < 1)
2011-10-30T13:54:28  <mleise> from one node to the next
2011-10-30T13:54:29  <a1k0n> nice.
2011-10-30T13:54:32  <lavalamp> if you switch to euclidian distance instead of manhattan you may not get the optimal path but the open set should stay much smaller
2011-10-30T13:54:48  <a1k0n> you'll still get the optimal path.
2011-10-30T13:55:00  <a1k0n> it's an underestimate of the distance, and is hence admissible
2011-10-30T13:55:04  <lavalamp> well, you'll get *an* optimal path :)

2011-10-30T14:08:23  <Migi32> ok but back to my first question. Break the main loop at 490ms, 499ms or 499.9ms?
2011-10-30T14:08:26  <danielharan> a1k0n: haha, I did that too :O
2011-10-30T14:09:02  <a1k0n> Migi32: what's the variance in your inner loop iteration?
2011-10-30T14:09:18  <Migi32> pretty much 0.
2011-10-30T14:09:38  <a1k0n> then 499.9ms?
2011-10-30T14:09:50  <merk> does anyone here
2011-10-30T14:09:55  <merk> codes the bot in c?
2011-10-30T14:10:05  <Minthos> all right, ants.fluxid.pl is up again and my bot needs opponents!
2011-10-30T14:10:08  <a1k0n> C++ count?
2011-10-30T14:10:16  <Migi32> yeah, but if you submit at 499.9ms, don't you risk that the server only reads your input at 500.1ms?
2011-10-30T14:10:18  <Minthos> thanks Fluxid :)
2011-10-30T14:10:20  <Fluxid> Minthos: i've connected
2011-10-30T14:10:38  <Fluxid> np
2011-10-30T14:10:44  <a1k0n> Migi32: yeah, potentially.  i guess we don't know what the scheduling slop is going to be.
2011-10-30T14:11:30  <roflmao> oh shiiiit
2011-10-30T14:11:42  <Migi32> I think I'm going with 495 or something. I know it's kind of a big margin but that extra 1% of time probably won't do much anyway

2011-10-30T14:12:50  <Bostown> Hello
2011-10-30T14:12:58  <bmh> for timing I wouldn't use a normal distribution
2011-10-30T14:13:16  <overburn> is it just me or a* doesn't seem to be the best choice for pathfinding on this specific problem?
2011-10-30T14:13:29  <bmh> overburn: define best
2011-10-30T14:13:36  <roflmao> @overburn: when mine doesn't time out it is a beast
2011-10-30T14:13:37  <Minthos> overburn: "this problem" has many subproblems
2011-10-30T14:13:37  <contestbot> roflmao: I'm sorry Dave, err roflmao; I cannot 'overburn:'.
2011-10-30T14:13:53  <Fluxid> Migi32: do you so many stuff you need to limit time?
2011-10-30T14:14:09  <Migi32> yeah
2011-10-30T14:14:15  <Fluxid> Migi32: what language>?
2011-10-30T14:14:45  <overburn> ah , ok , good point. meaning for the basic pathfinding from point a to point b , without taking into account the choices of the programmer when it encounters an enemy ant or such
2011-10-30T14:15:04  <Migi32> C++, but it's not the language that's slow or the way I program, it's just the complexity of the algorithms I use
2011-10-30T14:15:06  <bmh> I'm looking into segmenting the map and then doing pathfinding on the abstract graph produced by the segmentation
2011-10-30T14:15:44  <UncleVasya> wtf? Why so many people have problems with slow pathfinding? I launch simple BFS several times (2 for food, 3 for enemy hiils, 2 for boundary) and still have a lot of time. Bot spend nearly 160ms for the turn. I wonder if it's only thanks to the fast language (OCaml) or your A* is something weird.
2011-10-30T14:15:56  <bmh> Migi32: for sufficiently large N, I can execute a linear algorithm by hand faster than you can execute an exponential algorithm on all the computers in the world :)
2011-10-30T14:16:07  <roflmao> My a* is probably weird
2011-10-30T14:16:24  <overburn> the thing is, trying to get my bot up and running and need a really simple pathfinding algorithm to start with ,
2011-10-30T14:16:26  <roflmao> why the fuck do i have duplicates onmy open set
2011-10-30T14:16:30  <Migi32> I don't use A*. I use something with a lot of preprocessing time but O(1) lookup
2011-10-30T14:16:33  <overburn> can anyone recomment one that can be implemented really fast?
2011-10-30T14:17:06  <UncleVasya> overburn: Breadth-first-search
2011-10-30T14:17:21  <bmh> UncleVasya: when you're trying to get a really fast A* implementation, it's easy to make mistakes.
2011-10-30T14:17:23  <Minthos> UncleVasya: my bots usually don't hit the time limit when I run it locally, but on the official server they do when I have around 100-150 ants on big maps
2011-10-30T14:17:36  <Minthos> written in D
2011-10-30T14:17:56  <overburn> hmm thanks uncle
2011-10-30T14:18:29  <UncleVasya> Minthos: So my advice is to make search from destinations. :)
2011-10-30T14:18:33  <Bostown> Just one question,,, Im trying to start now, and get cant get it working with the tutorials, can someone help me ?
2011-10-30T14:18:56  <Minthos> UncleVasya: I search both directions in different parts of my ai
2011-10-30T14:18:57  <Migi32> don't forget that it also depends on how often you're asking for a distance calculation
2011-10-30T14:19:13  <Draakon> ah.. Fluxid's server is back?
2011-10-30T14:19:16  <Minthos> UncleVasya: but yes, I need better pathfinding, that's my next step
2011-10-30T14:19:20  <Minthos> yes
2011-10-30T14:19:30  <Migi32> I'm doing it far more often than just asking for the distance between each ant and each food/enemy hill
2011-10-30T14:19:31  <Minthos> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=35057&user=4823 here's a good example
2011-10-30T14:19:36  <Fluxid> Draakon: yes
2011-10-30T14:19:47  <roflmao> is it normal to have duplicate nodes in the open set?
2011-10-30T14:19:49  <roflmao> no right?
2011-10-30T14:19:57  <Minthos> at some point here my ai just breaks down from starvation and my ants stop moving
2011-10-30T14:20:16  <bmh> roflmao: correct.
2011-10-30T14:20:16  <roflmao> @Minthos: Here's what I do. If food is visible, I use a* to hunt down that food
2011-10-30T14:20:17  <contestbot> roflmao: You have no gotten any error messages recently, so here's a random one just to let you know that we care.
2011-10-30T14:20:19  <Draakon> I installed one myself for shits and giggles while yours was down.. can someone check whether its even accessible for outside world?
2011-10-30T14:20:21  <bmh> duplicates = you're doing it wrong
2011-10-30T14:20:25  <Draakon> http://ants.ahju.eu:2080/
2011-10-30T14:20:47  <Minthos> Draakon: seems to work
2011-10-30T14:20:54  <Draakon> it seems to crash really easily
2011-10-30T14:21:00  <Draakon> at least the tcpserver.py part
2011-10-30T14:21:22  <Draakon> for example if I send some misformed packets
2011-10-30T14:21:25  <Fluxid> Minthos: at turn 628 your ants suddenly move, what happens there?
2011-10-30T14:21:37  <Fluxid> Draakon: yeah, code is not of the best quality
2011-10-30T14:21:50  <roflmao> that was the problem
2011-10-30T14:21:53  <roflmao> that was the fkin problem. WOW
2011-10-30T14:21:54  <Fluxid> also, who is darko, he uses invalid passowrd

2011-10-30T14:23:39  <Fluxid> Minthos: what scerver's scheduling has to do with it? O_o
2011-10-30T14:23:48  <bmh> given that everyone is using 4 defenders, I'm going to hardcode 5 ant kill squads
2011-10-30T14:23:54  <Minthos> Fluxid: this match was on the official server, not yours
2011-10-30T14:24:14  <Fluxid> Minthos: i know
2011-10-30T14:24:36  <Fluxid> i just wonder what in your bot made all of your ants move for two turns
2011-10-30T14:24:41  <Fluxid> ;)
2011-10-30T14:25:05  <Minthos> I assume my bot doesn't get exclusive cpu time, so maybe a game just finished and it got more cpu time than normal
2011-10-30T14:25:16  <Minthos> it's the only explanation I can think of
2011-10-30T14:25:18  <kara> numpy is officially allowed and works, right?

2011-10-30T14:26:59  <roflmao> it works! IT WORKS!!
2011-10-30T14:27:11  <UncleVasya> congrats
2011-10-30T14:27:23  <Minthos> yes, I abort all pathfinding when remaining time is less than 10%
2011-10-30T14:27:31  <Minthos> to avoid timeouts
2011-10-30T14:27:38  <delt0r__> Fluxid: bots are not run sequentally... you are alowed to use non blocking IO... so while you wait for input from the server you could be doing something usefull
2011-10-30T14:28:14  <Fluxid> Minthos: then i think you need to optimize hard ;)
2011-10-30T14:28:17  <delt0r__> ie when the other bots are running... so to do the round robin thing, the rules would need to explicitly ban that
2011-10-30T14:28:30  <Minthos> Fluxid: yes, that's my next step
2011-10-30T14:29:03  <Fluxid> delt0r__: ok, maybe i misunderstood.

2011-10-30T14:43:38  <UncleVasya> You said you added it to your environment vars. So you have something like c:\python27  in your system path?
2011-10-30T14:43:56  <bmh> The column is definitely not the right attack formation.

2011-10-30T14:48:00  <roflmao> is it faster than a*?
2011-10-30T14:48:01  <Fluxid> but it is not A* or anything special
2011-10-30T14:48:06  <bmh> bah, pathfinding. I should just make a dictionary storing every path I've ever computed
2011-10-30T14:48:09  <Islacrusez> delt0r__: alas, that doesn't help those not already proficient in programming, nor does it help me in enhancing my code >.>

2011-10-30T14:48:22  <roflmao> what language do you program in?
2011-10-30T14:48:27  <Fluxid> python
2011-10-30T14:48:30  <delt0r__> Islacrusez: well we can't write it for you...
2011-10-30T14:48:31  <roflmao> @bmh: wouldn't that cause your bot to crash at turn 0? :P
2011-10-30T14:48:31  <npskirk> Question about languages:  does the absence of a starter kit imply that the game challenge server is not prepared to run clients in that language?
2011-10-30T14:48:31  <contestbot> roflmao: Run as fast as you can and don't look back.
2011-10-30T14:48:33  <Fluxid> python 3 to be exact
2011-10-30T14:48:39  <ikaros> i just use BFS for food and hills and it is very fast.. don't understand all that trouble
2011-10-30T14:48:41  <bmh> roflmao: The idea is probably less stupid than it sounds
2011-10-30T14:48:44  <Fluxid> roflmao: don't use @ at the beginning
2011-10-30T14:48:59  <roflmao> fluxid: isn't python performance similar to ruby?
2011-10-30T14:49:22  <delt0r__> Islacrusez: start with something simple and start adding complexity slowly. Strip stuff out of the tut to see what makes it slow/fast
2011-10-30T14:49:38  <delt0r__> you know we all have to start somewhere....
2011-10-30T14:49:40  <bmh> I mean, look -- you can only travel in four directions
2011-10-30T14:49:43  <Islacrusez> I have yet to see a timeout locally
2011-10-30T14:49:52  <roflmao> that's insane
2011-10-30T14:49:59  <Islacrusez> and as for whoever told me that it times out because it takes too much time, you're an asshole
2011-10-30T14:50:06  <delt0r__> Islacrusez: a big thing is map size
2011-10-30T14:50:10  <bmh> so to get from any given square to any other square, you can partition the entire world into at most four pieces
2011-10-30T14:50:14  <delt0r__> Islacrusez: and ant count
2011-10-30T14:50:22  <roflmao> i guess I really need to optimize this bitch
2011-10-30T14:50:31  <bmh> so if you pathfind from (x -> y), store the path and the partition
2011-10-30T14:50:34  <Fluxid> roflmao: comparable. and depends on implementation, because there is cpython (reference, default, most popular), jython, ironpython (.net) and pypy (self-hosting rocket-science interpreter with JIT, 5x faster than cpython)
2011-10-30T14:51:09  <roflmao> fluxid: just wondering cause I get horrible performance on mine :), gradually improving it but makes me want to cry when i hear about people managing 200+ ants with a*
2011-10-30T14:51:10  <delt0r__> always wondered why python and perl are not on JITs yet gerneally
2011-10-30T14:51:26  <delt0r__> roflmao: have you profiled?
2011-10-30T14:51:42  <delt0r__> its never where you expect it to be... the performance bottle neck that is
2011-10-30T14:51:48  <roflmao> delt0r: that's a very good point
2011-10-30T14:52:00  <roflmao> delt0r: however I'm fairly certain it's with my a*
2011-10-30T14:52:09  <delt0r__> famous last words
2011-10-30T14:52:11  <roflmao> cause it crashes when the open node set is too long
2011-10-30T14:52:12  <ikaros> =)
2011-10-30T14:52:15  <Fluxid> roflmao: i had some problems with performance but i was able to optimize it after profiling and then it started to run 3x faster
2011-10-30T14:52:36  <roflmao> will do that then :)
2011-10-30T14:52:55  <bmh> I'll show all of you! Static pathfinding shall win the day
2011-10-30T14:52:58  <delt0r__> a* with the right heuristic and memory between ants and turns should not be that slow
2011-10-30T14:53:01  <roflmao> bmh: if you do it
2011-10-30T14:53:11  <roflmao> and it works
2011-10-30T14:53:21  <roflmao> then I'm totally doing it since thyat's a huge performance boost to have pre-computed paths
2011-10-30T14:53:24  <bmh> roflmao: finding a simple enough partition is probably the hard part
2011-10-30T14:53:26  <roflmao> even if it means sacrificing 30 turns or so
2011-10-30T14:54:25  <roflmao> fluxid: what heuristic do you use?
2011-10-30T14:54:31  <roflmao> i'm using manhattan, maybe that's the problem
2011-10-30T14:54:34  <roflmao> due to the maze nature
2011-10-30T14:54:49  <Fluxid> what do you mean?
2011-10-30T14:54:58  <roflmao> ah, right, you're running a different pathfinding algorithm
2011-10-30T14:55:23  <roflmao> heuristic = formula for estimating cost to goal
2011-10-30T14:55:24  <Fluxid> i run only few pathfinds a turn no matter how many ants i have, and cache the results

2011-10-30T15:25:23  <npskirk> Are you computing the entire search network for A* each turn?

2011-10-30T15:29:24  <npskirk> if you are creating new objects to populate the graph each time, you are doing a bunch of object instantiation that can be expensive

2011-10-30T15:30:16  <npskirk> If you can profile your code, look and see if the search itself is the bottleneck or if the setup of what you search over is the bottleneck
2011-10-30T15:30:30  <Gr1m> no, all up to date
2011-10-30T15:30:37  <Gr1m> i downloaded today

2011-10-30T15:30:53  <capa> does anyonde have a example of collision detection in C ?
2011-10-30T15:30:57  <roflmao> now, the setup might add just enough overhead to push the a* over the limit, that's true

2011-10-30T15:31:54  <delt0r__> Gr1m: some of the starter packs have different quality but IIRC the python one does have a "isWater" method somewhere

2011-10-30T15:32:39  <Gr1m> ya, it does but it collides with other ants

2011-10-30T15:54:56  <roflmao> where you sort the nodes in the open_set by their cost
2011-10-30T15:55:03  <roflmao> you check lower cost nodes first
2011-10-30T15:55:04  <overburn> yeah ,i know :)
2011-10-30T15:55:14  <roflmao> and you can use manhattan as the heuristic for the cost
2011-10-30T15:55:16  <roflmao> simple and effective
2011-10-30T15:55:27  <overburn> oh , that makes sense
2011-10-30T15:55:29  <overburn> thanks mate

2011-10-30T16:01:08  <overburn> i menat that you could basically divide the path in several segments and process them as you go after getting a big picture
2011-10-30T16:01:37  <roflmao> you mean break it up through multiple turns?

2011-10-30T16:06:14  <overburn> also, what's mu?
2011-10-30T16:06:26  <roflmao> it's very common for ants to pick on unexpected food on the way to the target food
2011-10-30T16:06:34  <roflmao> so i almost never modify the path based on the appearence of new food
2011-10-30T16:06:41  <overburn> of course not food
2011-10-30T16:06:43  <overburn> lol
2011-10-30T16:06:44  <Fluxid> overburn: "true skill"
2011-10-30T16:06:45  <overburn> i meant other ants
2011-10-30T16:06:53  <roflmao> oh yes
2011-10-30T16:06:57  <roflmao> i haven't gotten there yet :P
2011-10-30T16:06:58  <Fluxid> sigma is uncertainty of true skill
2011-10-30T16:07:07  <Fluxid> visible skill = mu-3*sigma
2011-10-30T16:07:10  <roflmao> first I need to get the fucking thing working well then I can worry about ant collision
2011-10-30T16:07:15  <overburn> heh i haven't gotten to implementing almost anything yet
2011-10-30T16:07:23  <overburn> however i have a great timeshifting system haha ;))
2011-10-30T16:08:03  <overburn> and ants that move randomly + useless calculations to test it
2011-10-30T16:08:24  <Migi32> Fluxid: Xathis has almost the same mu as A atm. But A has very high sigma, why is that? Shouldn't sigma go down with number of games played?
2011-10-30T16:08:27  <burny> anyone making their ai take into account, not only what target is best, but what target is likely to be best after that?
2011-10-30T16:09:03  <overburn> nope but thanks for the idea :D
2011-10-30T16:10:43  <analyst74> hey Fluxid, just curious, is python performance a problem for you?

2011-10-30T16:22:21  <Migi32> if you want to use C, you could just as well use C++ and write C-style code but still use some C++ functionality wherever it's useful.
2011-10-30T16:22:26  <Migi32> that's my opinion anyway
2011-10-30T16:23:10  <Fluxid> analyst74: on my compy with q6600 managing near 600 ants for the time gets over 500ms

2011-10-30T16:24:22  <Migi32> amstan: std::map and stuff. That stuff is quite a bit less user-friendly in C.

2011-10-30T16:41:55  <Puj> dfsd, with what?

2011-10-30T16:42:09  <overburn> dfsd what kind of problems?
2011-10-30T16:42:26  <dfsd> the code that they provide doesn't work
2011-10-30T16:42:39  <Puj> What's the problem with the code? dfsd?

2011-10-30T16:48:29  <isbric> Migi32: how about you?
2011-10-30T16:48:49  <Chirmaya_> Quick question. The text data that we are passed per turn, does any of it include information of whether or not we have visibility of the square? Or do we calculate that ourselves?
2011-10-30T16:49:05  <analyst74> Chirmaya_, you have to calculate it

2011-10-30T16:49:22  <analyst74> most starter kits do have that logic implemented though
2011-10-30T16:49:26  <dfsd> hello?
2011-10-30T16:49:46  <Chirmaya_> My ruby one didn't, and my custom method isn't efficient on big maps =(
2011-10-30T16:49:48  <Puj> All information passed implies visibility of the square which contains the information, beyond that, no empty tiles, that is, non-land, non-water tiles are given in the turn information.
2011-10-30T16:49:53  <Migi32> isbric: very interesting. It'll be nice to see if this works out or not. At the moment NN stuff is way down at the bottom of my todo list. I have some ideas, but that's all :)
2011-10-30T16:50:02  <analyst74> dfsd, you need to implement that logic yourself
2011-10-30T16:50:06  <swinejihad> my java pack doesn't have visibility logic
2011-10-30T16:50:06  <Puj> Not many of the starter packages have optimal visibility functions.
2011-10-30T16:50:21  <Chirmaya_> Oh, Puj, haha, thanks you again!
2011-10-30T16:50:38  <dfsd> analyst74: how?
2011-10-30T16:50:42  <Chirmaya_> I am so blind for not thinking of that. I was checking visibility to each tile from each ant, hahaha
2011-10-30T16:50:56  <isbric> Migi32: how come, you doubt the use or just want to try somthing else out first?
2011-10-30T16:50:58  <Migi32> isbric: currently I assign scores to each of my ant's possible moves and I select the best moves each time. The NN stuff would be part of that scoring function, but probably not much more.

2011-10-30T17:02:51  <Puj> It's probably because of an error.

2011-10-30T17:13:33  <Puj> I think it should be fairly simple actually.. maybe just wrapping the Bot class should do it.
2011-10-30T17:13:39  <overburn> say i have the ants vector , and a food vector
2011-10-30T17:13:56  <overburn> which would be the most effective way to get the closest food item for an ant ?

2011-10-30T18:02:46  <janzert> McLeopold: besides the above?
2011-10-30T18:03:57  <janzert> I think before I can take a guess at a good criteria I need to make a tool so I can view some histograms of game lengths per map and ending type
2011-10-30T18:04:29  <paulwal> is it legal for your bot to dynamically load a .so?  For instance, Tcl loading a sqlite3.so for a memory-only sql database
2011-10-30T18:05:13  <McLeopold> janzert: if you can use some type of js visualization, like d3, that would be nice to put on the site
2011-10-30T18:06:01  <isbric> paulwal: thats realy intresting, im hoping for the readonly rule, but if it fails ill have to compile my db.

2011-10-30T18:06:34  <McLeopold> if we produce json and can cache it, it shouldn't be too bad

2011-10-30T18:07:49  <McLeopold> and, yes, you can try that
2011-10-30T18:08:13  <dfsd> does all the python tut work?
2011-10-30T18:08:28  <McLeopold> dfsd: it should, I wrote the bot before I wrote the tutorial
2011-10-30T18:08:32  <wnight> The test script spits out one frame of a text view, is there a way to use this instead of the java visualizer?
2011-10-30T18:08:46  <dfsd> well Step 1 is not working for me
2011-10-30T18:09:25  <paulwal> McLeopold: awesome. you're probably right, though sqlite can be quite fast and convenient. I figured i'd experiment
2011-10-30T18:10:00  <dfsd> the python collision detection code doesn't do anything when i add it to MyBot.py

2011-10-30T18:58:20  <asdsfafas> grom358: yeah that could be tough
2011-10-30T18:58:26  <grom358> asdsfafas: no.. log to a file is the best option.. stdout is for bot commands

2011-10-30T18:59:44  <grom358> asdsfafas: so my idea for workaround.. was to have ant packs that move together... but haven't figured out how to code moving them as group when dealing with obstacles and narrow areas etc
2011-10-30T19:00:16  <grom358> and fit in with the path I calculate with A*

2011-10-30T19:04:41  <bmh> think about it this way -- imagine you have a graph that abstracts over the grid
2011-10-30T19:04:48  <dfsd> whats the best way to debug a bot?
2011-10-30T19:04:58  <bmh> dfsd: snarky answer: with your brain
2011-10-30T19:05:20  <bmh> you have edge that connect the nodes of the abstract graph and these have weights that correspond to the number of ants abreast you can push though
2011-10-30T19:05:50  <dfsd> pretty hard to see whats going on in the background with only my brain
2011-10-30T19:05:55  <McLeopold> It looked like there was one matchup creation in progress and a few checks for submissions
2011-10-30T19:06:03  <bmh> If you have five ants, find a flow on the abstract graph and kill off the edges that hit capacity
2011-10-30T19:06:30  <janzert> I did notice the other day matchup creation seemed to be getting a bit long again

2011-10-30T19:09:31  <grom358> well. i was thinking of have ants that follow another ant.. so one ant is doing the pathfind
2011-10-30T19:10:25  <grom358> and the rest just follow... but the leader ant will have to stop whenever it sees enemy ants ahead and let the ants get back into formation
2011-10-30T19:10:47  <cyphase> or just find the path and store it for any ant in the start area that wants to get to the destination area

2011-10-30T19:19:16  <henry61> For the main server, has anyone suggested the idea of giving slight preference to 1) newer submissions and 2) submissions in the upper x% (where x could be as big as the top 50%, etc.). That way, 80% of the server resources aren't tied up just playing starter packages against each other over and over again...

2011-10-30T19:54:37  <dinosoep> and grom, if you write to stdout it'll print that output too
2011-10-30T19:55:00  <lastaid_> mh... i have the java_starter_pack and in this folder i also have the tools folder
2011-10-30T19:55:14  <grom358> stdout from your bot feeds into the game.. the engine reads what gets put onto stdout
2011-10-30T19:55:36  <grom358> so.. you can't use it for printing out other stuff
2011-10-30T19:55:38  <JDawg> rats, it looks like System.err doesn't print ot the terminal either
2011-10-30T19:55:49  <grom358> JDawg: just use a logger
2011-10-30T19:56:02  <grom358> JDawg: java.util.logging .. built into Java for you to use
2011-10-30T19:56:13  <dinosoep> then I'm abusing it grom :p it prints my output with #error next to it. Doesn't give any problems though
2011-10-30T19:56:14  <JDawg> ah, great, thank you much
2011-10-30T19:56:25  <JDawg> was hoping not to write java file IO from scratch

2011-10-30T19:59:48  <JDawg> wow, this java logging thing is beastly
2011-10-30T20:00:05  <lastaid_> if you guys want to test your bot, what exactly do you do?
2011-10-30T20:00:24  <grom358> lastaid: I start by playing against the hunter bot
2011-10-30T20:00:30  <grom358> on the tutorial map

2011-10-30T20:01:32  <Draakon> "Test Error: compiled, but failed test cases": turn 1 bot 0 timed out
2011-10-30T20:01:35  <Draakon> still no ideas?
2011-10-30T20:01:41  <JDawg> wow thanks
2011-10-30T20:02:22  <grom358> JDawg: then you just do logger.info("my debug message"); to use it
2011-10-30T20:02:27  <lastaid_> i got it, had to use another srypt to use the java bot instead of the python but

2011-10-30T20:08:30  <bob__> C++ may be helpp to code in, but being able to do depth 90 breadth first searches in 12ms is awesome
2011-10-30T20:09:10  <grom358> bob: Java pretty fast too, :P
2011-10-30T20:10:17  <bob__> unfortunately, I still can't think of a good way to handle fighting
2011-10-30T20:10:33  <grom358> bob__: same
2011-10-30T20:10:50  <grom358> my idea at the moment.. cluster up ants and hope for the best
2011-10-30T20:11:14  <grom358> should be lot better than my current suicidal ants
2011-10-30T20:11:28  <bob__> mine just go for their goal while completely ignoring enemies
2011-10-30T20:11:36  <grom358> bob: sames
2011-10-30T20:12:22  <grom358> so any form of defence means bad news for my bot
2011-10-30T20:12:48  <grom358> got me into above 400 rank so far though
2011-10-30T20:12:57  <bob__> yeah
2011-10-30T20:13:08  <bob__> mine just does BFS and it's already rank 116
2011-10-30T20:13:18  <bob__> you don't need fighting ability till you get near the top
2011-10-30T20:13:34  <grom358> 116.. how? do you have defender ants?
2011-10-30T20:13:47  <bob__> nope
2011-10-30T20:13:50  <grom358> your bot kind of sounds like at same level as mine
2011-10-30T20:14:13  <bob__> on a single hill map, it usually has ants spawning near continuously from the hill
2011-10-30T20:14:19  <bob__> on multihill maps it doesn't do so well
2011-10-30T20:14:30  <bob__> so defence kind of happens on accident
2011-10-30T20:14:31  <grom358> ah.. yeah i been in a few multihill maps
2011-10-30T20:14:52  <grom358> yeah.. do you priority food over hills?
2011-10-30T20:15:19  <bob__> my ants just go for the closest food, unexplored space, or enemy hill
2011-10-30T20:15:35  <grom358> bob: yeap.. same as mine
2011-10-30T20:15:35  <bob__> while trying to avoid colliding with each other
2011-10-30T20:15:43  <grom358> just wondering how u got to 116 is all
2011-10-30T20:15:52  <bob__> how many games have you played?
2011-10-30T20:16:02  <grom358> with current one.. 5
2011-10-30T20:16:07  <bob__> it will go up a lot then
2011-10-30T20:16:11  <grom358> the games are taking way too long

2011-10-30T20:16:14  <bob__> mine's at 20 right now
2011-10-30T20:16:31  <bob__> there's a big uncertianty penalty, so just playign more games will make you shoot up the rankings
2011-10-30T20:19:46  <bob__> I wonder if I should make mine go for non visible spaces
2011-10-30T20:19:56  <bob__> because right now, once the map is explored and no food is visible, they just sit there

2011-10-30T20:20:56  <bob__> I don't know
2011-10-30T20:20:58  <bob__> it's strange
2011-10-30T20:21:20  <grom358> I did code up a fallback maze walk routine.. but it never used cause it never gets into that state
2011-10-30T20:21:25  <bob__> I guess the search could be timing out
2011-10-30T20:21:29  <bob__> but it doesn't seem likely
2011-10-30T20:21:44  <bob__> even with 38 searchs and 90 depth, it only takes 12ms on my laptop
2011-10-30T20:22:17  <grom358> yeah.. my bot taking less then 100ms for it turn.. even with 200 ants
2011-10-30T20:22:46  <grom358> though for some weird reason one of my games my bot timeout on turn 1. but I seen on forums a post about java bots doing that sometimes
2011-10-30T20:22:56  <Fluxid> duh, i promised myself that after newest version i won't work on my bot anymore...
2011-10-30T20:23:04  <Fluxid> but i know already how to make it better
2011-10-30T20:23:09  <grom358> someone suggested its was Java warmup or GC
2011-10-30T20:23:13  <bob__> how?
2011-10-30T20:23:14  <cyphase> *any*more?
2011-10-30T20:23:20  <roflmao> well, I'm excited about this new Java bot
2011-10-30T20:23:22  <grom358> I got heaps todo yet

2011-10-30T20:24:16  <Fluxid> but i need to create first a scenariobott - it would gather minimal amount of food and place ants in given places, so i could test my bot how he handles those situations
2011-10-30T20:24:17  <grom358> atm I said the closest ant to food (if its walkable - using BFS).. but just thought of something before. I should group up food into patches.. and one ant can collect all in that patch

2011-10-30T20:24:49  <lastaid_> anyone exactly knows how the fight system works?

2011-10-30T22:01:36  <Ionic_Groove> do AI built in compiled languages have an advantage in speed in this game?
2011-10-30T22:01:44  <burny> yes
2011-10-30T22:01:46  <burny> obviously
2011-10-30T22:01:47  <TinBane> does "unknown action" mean a command that means nothing, or could it be an illegal move? Because it's outputting absolutely standard orders, as per the spec :/
2011-10-30T22:01:54  <Ionic_Groove> hmpf
2011-10-30T22:02:04  <TinBane> Yes, you can do a better search, because you have more timelimit.
2011-10-30T22:02:21  <Ionic_Groove> I figured some form of equilization would be used
2011-10-30T22:02:27  <TinBane> how?
2011-10-30T22:02:40  <TinBane> That would be pretty contentious.
2011-10-30T22:04:45  <Ionic_Groove> that sucks
2011-10-30T22:05:17  <TinBane> Well how would you weight it to be fair? It's impossible.
2011-10-30T22:05:26  <TinBane> Odds are, they will split the results by language type.
2011-10-30T22:05:32  <TinBane> Top python implementation, etc.
2011-10-30T22:06:03  <TinBane> You can't factor a direct comparison, because the speed to execute depends on the mix of commands used.

2011-10-30T22:16:45  <krishna> Ionic_Groove: A Python bot has been number one for a while. It's in the top three now. Java isn't considered a particularly fast language and it holds the top two spots at the moment.

2011-10-30T22:41:19  <venom> anyone knows the specs of the contest's game server?  1 second per turn doesn't mean nothing when planning your algo, strategies & tactics
2011-10-30T22:42:06  <bmh> venom: make it flexible. Do something, ask how long it took and plan accordingly
2011-10-30T22:42:07  <venom> the specs of the server wouldn't give a good idea, but at least your could speculate a little
2011-10-30T22:42:19  <bmh> In the beginning of the universe you have a lot of time to kill
2011-10-30T22:42:27  <avdg> they are quite powerful afaik
2011-10-30T22:42:30  <bmh> just burn your first few turns figuring out how many horses you have
2011-10-30T22:43:23  <venom> bmh: of course, but some strategies and their algo just aren't good when you don't get enough processing power/time
2011-10-30T22:43:42  <bmh> venom: implement a bunch and pick which one to use based on how fast the box is :)
2011-10-30T22:44:05  <avdg> and think about things you (could) have
2011-10-30T22:44:06  <venom> bmh: yeah, we're pretty stuck with that, I know.
2011-10-30T22:45:56  <venom> avdg: by the stats it gives on the profile page, I feel it's not that powerful. My system could run as much games as that server and mine is only a Athlon II X4 630 with 4gb ram
2011-10-30T22:46:07  <bmh> "only"
2011-10-30T22:46:50  <venom> Anyway, I wish I game logs would give us some info about how much times each turn took.  Wait... are they?   meh.
2011-10-30T22:47:32  <amstan> venom: yes, but are you running 8 players at the same time?
2011-10-30T22:48:34  <venom> bmh: you're right. It's pretty good and I come off as a non-appreciative asshole.    :)     640kb should be enough for everyone!  and here I am crying of my 4gb and awesome cpu.
2011-10-30T22:49:09  <bmh> venom: I think the box under my desk at work has 16gb, I've never really noticed.
2011-10-30T22:49:09  <venom> amstan: nope, but I factored the number of players that we're playing per minutes.
2011-10-30T22:49:40  <amstan> did you also take into account that the players use the full time?
2011-10-30T22:49:48  <bmh> I can't recall many problems where I've actually been constrained by the specifications of my machine
2011-10-30T22:51:27  <venom> bmh: what an awesome technological era we're into. My first computer had a 40mb harddrive and about 2 megs of RAM and your machine has 8192 time more ram than my teenage years rig.  wow.
2011-10-30T22:51:40  <bmh> venom: Was that 1992?
2011-10-30T22:51:57  <venom> amstan: what do you mean by 'use the full time'?
2011-10-30T22:52:11  <bmh> I remember having a 486 with 40mb harddrive, 2mb ram, and a 2400 bps modem!
2011-10-30T22:52:29  <avdg> I only remember 2gb drives :/
2011-10-30T22:52:36  <amstan> they can't just be the starter bots, they have to use 0.5s each turn if you wanna test it like that.
2011-10-30T22:52:48  <burny> in 99 I had a system with 1gig of ram, and it pwned so hard
2011-10-30T22:53:01  <venom> bmh: yeah, near enough.  *close the light, raise the volume*   Second Reality ..  awwwwwww
2011-10-30T22:53:24  <venom> bmh: about the same rig as mine, except I had a 386.
2011-10-30T22:53:58  <bmh> For the first time in 13 years my internet has gotten faster!
2011-10-30T22:53:59  <venom> avdg: Well, your :/ should be ->  :D     lol
2011-10-30T22:54:19  <bmh> burny: that's a serious amount of ram for that long ago
2011-10-30T22:54:41  <venom> amstan: I get it. Btw, is the server spec a secret?
2011-10-30T22:54:51  <amstan> venom: no
2011-10-30T22:55:03  <amstan> venom: i'm just a little lazy to get it right now
2011-10-30T22:55:03  <venom> burny: 1gb in 99 was epic
2011-10-30T22:55:13  <amstan> i know it's dual core and has 12GB ram
2011-10-30T22:55:14  <burny> ya.. it was
2011-10-30T22:55:29  <burny> I could copy cd's to ram drive
2011-10-30T22:56:35  <venom> amstan: good enough.  but seeing the number of registration each days and the time it already take to have a game played, I feel like it could become to slow by mid-november. Do you feel too?
2011-10-30T22:56:41  <burny> some games wouldn't install though
2011-10-30T22:57:31  <venom> *to = too
2011-10-30T22:57:31  <burny> cause 2gig < 16meg requirements, in 32bit signed
2011-10-30T22:57:43  <amstan> venom: i think we'll get more comps near the end
2011-10-30T22:57:46  <bmh> burny: that's beautiful.
2011-10-30T22:57:52  <venom> burny: lol
2011-10-30T22:57:53  <amstan> contestbot: seen janzert
2011-10-30T22:57:53  <contestbot> amstan: janzert was last seen in #aichallenge 3 hours, 49 minutes, and 47 seconds ago: <janzert> for 10 player game
2011-10-30T22:58:05  <burny> the machine was for work though, not personal
2011-10-30T22:58:08  <janzert> yes?
2011-10-30T22:58:21  <venom> amstan: okay
2011-10-30T22:58:24  <bmh> I ran into a problem with a satellite phone. The drivers were written for Windows XP and I was using a computer with Windows 7 -- "Sorry, this application requires Windows XP or later"
2011-10-30T22:59:26  <burny> wow.. I haven't seen that error since 95 or 98 versions
2011-10-30T22:59:32  <venom> "later" as "whatever, later! *runs*"
2011-10-30T23:00:02  <bmh> it eventually did work in compatibility mode, but for a couple of minutes my stomach was on the floor
2011-10-30T23:00:27  *** venom is now known as venom_away
2011-10-30T23:00:51  <amstan> i had this one program, which wouldn't run on 98 and 95 claiming it only worked in win3.1
2011-10-30T23:00:55  <amstan> but then it worked on xp
2011-10-30T23:02:15  <janzert> We should surpass planetwars number of total users tomorrow
2011-10-30T23:02:21  <amstan> woot!
2011-10-30T23:02:24  <bmh> sweet.
2011-10-30T23:02:31  <bmh> hopefully I can get up a bot that isn't the started bot by tomorrow...
2011-10-30T23:03:32  <roflmao> I got some good leads
2011-10-30T23:03:38  <amstan> bmh: are you still doing the map predictions?
2011-10-30T23:03:40  <roflmao> imo what works best is a scavenger/hunter combo
2011-10-30T23:03:50  <roflmao> hunter = a* — quick food grabbing
2011-10-30T23:04:01  <roflmao> no food, go to a kickass explorer mode to find food
2011-10-30T23:04:03  <bmh> amstan: I would like to, I need to get other stuff working first
2011-10-30T23:21:47  <roflmao> this thing is like crack
2011-10-30T23:21:49  <roflmao> can't put it down
2011-10-30T23:22:06  <roflmao> it drives me crazy cause it's hard to get a good optimized bot but i can't put it down
2011-10-30T23:22:10  <roflmao> love hate relationship all the way
2011-10-30T23:25:47  <asdsfafas> roflmao: I agree... I should be doing my homework but nope... just spent the entire day on this x.x
2011-10-30T23:26:23  <asdsfafas> I finally got my alternative pathfinder working! (it's not A* mwahahahaha and I had to build it from scratch )
2011-10-30T23:28:45  * avdg thinks a* is fitting less in his idea, the more he thinks about it
2011-10-30T23:28:59  <avdg> though its still a good one to implement
2011-10-30T23:29:25  <roflmao> a* fits perfectly in my "idea"
2011-10-30T23:29:35  <roflmao> it just doesn't fit perfectly for the speed I require
2011-10-30T23:29:52  <roflmao> btu that was the old ruby code, now I'm trying in java and doing things a lot more intellegently so hopefully this time around I'll fit it in :)
2011-10-30T23:30:00  <avdg> yeah, I was already thinking about the pf problem from day 1
2011-10-30T23:30:25  <avdg> and I'm still stuck with how I should implement my idea
2011-10-30T23:30:28  <roflmao> thing is a* is actually more optimized than other simpler pathfinding algorithms like bfs
2011-10-30T23:30:45  <yoden> i think a correctly implemented a* should be able to solve the whole board in one turn pretty easily
2011-10-30T23:30:45  <yoden> :X
2011-10-30T23:30:47  <avdg> for point to point pathfinding yes
2011-10-30T23:30:51  <asdsfafas> yeah A* was slowing mine down so I created my own
2011-10-30T23:31:04  <asdsfafas> so far no timeouts at all even with 100s of ants =D
2011-10-30T23:31:11  <asdsfafas> using my method for each ant woohoo
2011-10-30T23:31:13  <avdg> but I am looking for situations where I can rely less on point to point navigation
2011-10-30T23:31:19  <roflmao> please share your method asdfafas
2011-10-30T23:31:19  <asdsfafas> and on python lol
2011-10-30T23:31:28  <roflmao> NICE dude cause I would like to use ruby
2011-10-30T23:31:35  <roflmao> instead of ugly verbose java
2011-10-30T23:31:45  <asdsfafas> I'll probably do a re-write in C++
2011-10-30T23:31:46  <roflmao> if you want to keep it sekkrit i understand :P
2011-10-30T23:32:11  <avdg> roflmao: will hack it anyway ;-) (just kidding :-))
2011-10-30T23:32:12  <asdsfafas> well... part of it is turning the map into a graph
2011-10-30T23:32:21  <asdsfafas> you'll have to figure out the rest ;)
2011-10-30T23:32:33  <avdg> s/://
2011-10-30T23:32:43  <roflmao> my brain just hurts thinking about map into graph
2011-10-30T23:33:14  <avdg> yeah, that reward would be very great for me
2011-10-30T23:33:15  <tmandry> a graph? isn't that what A* and others do? (it's been awhile for me)
2011-10-30T23:33:19  <asdsfafas> just remember... the maps we play on is a torus... use that to your advantage too
2011-10-30T23:33:26  <roflmao> torus?
2011-10-30T23:33:36  <asdsfafas> tmandry: yup, but I made a few changes
2011-10-30T23:33:36  <tmandry> roflmao: it wraps
2011-10-30T23:33:41  <asdsfafas> actually quite a few changes
2011-10-30T23:33:47  <roflmao> ah yes, that's key and I haven't implemented that
2011-10-30T23:33:49  <avdg> its like a donut
2011-10-30T23:34:16  <tmandry> asdsfafas: I take it you sacrificed better paths for more speed?
2011-10-30T23:34:17  <avdg> but a very strange one
2011-10-30T23:34:33  <asdsfafas> roflmao: exactly... if you're at (0,0) and you want to get to (29,0) you can do it in 1 step (map height = 30)
2011-10-30T23:34:41  <asdsfafas> tmandry: yessir
2011-10-30T23:34:54  <roflmao> yep
2011-10-30T23:35:04  <roflmao> i just haven't thought it through yet
2011-10-30T23:35:06  <asdsfafas> tmandry: although the paths it finds aren't the worst either
2011-10-30T23:35:18  <roflmao> on how to implement it through the heuristic and pathfinding
2011-10-30T23:35:18  <asdsfafas> tmandry: just not the absolute shortest
2011-10-30T23:35:22  <roflmao> I will, eventually, of course
2011-10-30T23:35:24  <roflmao> aint too hard
2011-10-30T23:35:39  <asdsfafas> tmandry: since map conditions change anyway (enemies moving n whatnot) there's no point using A*
2011-10-30T23:36:08  <roflmao> random question:
2011-10-30T23:36:13  <tmandry> asdsfafas: fair enough. sounds like you've analyzed the problem pretty well
2011-10-30T23:36:18  <avdg> asdsfafas: you can generate targets ;-)
2011-10-30T23:36:22  <roflmao> overestimating the heuristic cost in a standard a* to take off emphasis from the G
2011-10-30T23:36:25  * tmandry just started looking at AI challenge.. no code yet :)
2011-10-30T23:36:35  <roflmao> does that mean LOWERING the heuristic cost artificially or INCREASING it
2011-10-30T23:37:43  <roflmao> logically I think it is lowering it artificially cause that'll lead to lower costs for the H which pushes G nodes back on the open set a bit
2011-10-30T23:37:53  <roflmao> if that makes any sense at all
2011-10-30T23:38:01  <roflmao> but "overestimating" implies increasing the cost of h artificially

2011-10-30T23:39:19  <roflmao> and then use something else for the rest due to changing conditions
2011-10-30T23:39:37  <roflmao> a* would only be used for foods that are 5-6 squares away from ant

2011-10-30T23:40:36  <roflmao> ON AVERAGE if I allow a* to craft a path for an ant to a food that is rather far away
2011-10-30T23:40:45  <roflmao> that ant ends up picking up 4-5 foods automatically along the way
2011-10-30T23:40:50  <bmh> pathfindin would be so much easier if the damn ants had eyes
2011-10-30T23:41:22  <avdg> :) the best way to pf is not having to pf at all
2011-10-30T23:41:31  <asdsfafas> bmh: yeah these ants are nothing like REAL ants
2011-10-30T23:41:33  <roflmao> you don't pathfind?
2011-10-30T23:41:39  <avdg> well, minimize
2011-10-30T23:42:03  <roflmao> I was thinking in only pathfinding for nearby foods
2011-10-30T23:42:09  <roflmao> and if the path goes over 5 steps abort
2011-10-30T23:42:20  <roflmao> cause sometimes a nearby food is actually behind a huge wall that you need to go around
2011-10-30T23:42:22  <roflmao> and can be deceptive
2011-10-30T23:42:26  <avdg> and thats where you put a* for, right...
2011-10-30T23:42:31  <roflmao> correct
2011-10-30T23:42:40  <avdg> a* is good for long distances
2011-10-30T23:42:46  <roflmao> what would you recommend for short?
2011-10-30T23:42:46  <avdg> with relative cheep cost
2011-10-30T23:42:57  <roflmao> 5-6 square distance
2011-10-30T23:42:58  * bmh grumbles.
2011-10-30T23:43:02  <bmh> static. pathfinding.
2011-10-30T23:43:15  <burny> a* is good for known mazes, that don't change
2011-10-30T23:43:44  <avdg> well, that condition only applies when a* is searching
2011-10-30T23:43:51  <bmh> Frozen yogurt is more fun than pathfinding. I'm going to do that.
2011-10-30T23:43:55  <roflmao> bmh: I just don't see how you are going to reasonably compute all possible paths on a 127x127 grid when you only have 300ms per turn
2011-10-30T23:44:17  <burny> you don't need to compute them all
2011-10-30T23:44:25  <burny> if there is only 1 wall between you and the food..
2011-10-30T23:44:31  <burny> just follow the wall

2011-10-30T23:44:56  <roflmao> assuming ants only pursue food that are in their line of sight

2011-10-30T23:45:01  <roflmao> :P
2011-10-30T23:45:08  <burny> if it's far away..
2011-10-30T23:45:17  <burny> then either naother ant is closer.. or you can't see the food
2011-10-30T23:45:28  <roflmao> yep I just made that brilliant discovery today :)
2011-10-30T23:45:29  <burny> if you can't see it(cause you died).. then probably an enemy already got it anyway
2011-10-30T23:45:32  <roflmao> and it's going to change my game completely
2011-10-30T23:45:47  <roflmao> oh, the DUHs you miss when you start out

2011-10-30T23:46:11  <roflmao> that's actually very interesting burny, hugging the wall
2011-10-30T23:46:25  <roflmao> so you could implement a sort of combined explorer and lefty bot
2011-10-30T23:46:28  <burny> huging the wall fails if there are 2 walls in the way ofcourse
2011-10-30T23:46:45  <roflmao> not if you implement it correctly
2011-10-30T23:46:46  <burny> but if there's 2 walls in the way, but it's in sight range.. is a semi rare occurance
2011-10-30T23:46:53  <roflmao> it just means the wall is 2 squares thick
2011-10-30T23:47:05  <burny> 2squares thick = 1wall

2011-10-30T23:47:23  <roflmao> wall - space - wall - food
2011-10-30T23:47:59  <burny> even if it's 2 away, and you assume it's 1away.. there's roughly a 30% chance that you'll see the proper path before you get to it
2011-10-30T23:48:36  <avdg> (this is getting interesting :-))
2011-10-30T23:48:43  <roflmao> you are a genius burny
2011-10-30T23:48:48  <roflmao> fuck a*
2011-10-30T23:48:53  <roflmao> I'm going with some of your infinite wisdom
2011-10-30T23:48:59  <burny> np
2011-10-30T23:49:04  <roflmao> plus a cool scavenger algorithm that effectively spreads ants
2011-10-30T23:49:18  <avdg> a* is still a good fallback algorithm ;-)
2011-10-30T23:49:30  <roflmao> yea but once you manage like 150 ants
2011-10-30T23:49:36  <roflmao> you can't afford the expense imo
2011-10-30T23:49:41  <avdg> true
2011-10-30T23:49:42  <roflmao> unless you use it VERY sparingly
2011-10-30T23:49:42  <burny> a* is going to be good for the final attack.. if you don't just save ants paths
2011-10-30T23:49:58  <avdg> but the trick with a* is to optimize is for your purpose
2011-10-30T23:50:20  <avdg> and before using a*, you could try to use a few checks to reduce your lookup

2011-10-30T23:52:26  <asdsfafas> top 100 would be awesome!
2011-10-30T23:52:29  <roflmao> it's probably System.out.something

2011-10-30T23:52:51  <avdg> meh, I almost never programmed in java
2011-10-30T23:53:01  <avdg> its the best way ;-)
2011-10-30T23:53:11  <avdg> if you want to do it quickly
2011-10-30T23:53:12  <yoden> certainly was the easiest to set up

2011-10-30T23:54:35  <burny> nope, but I got nitro
2011-10-30T23:54:43  <roflmao> this stupid tutorial bot doesn't chase food like it says :P
2011-10-30T23:54:57  <avdg> mine doesn't do it as well

2011-10-30T23:55:52  <roflmao> it just bounces back and forth between the same 2 squares
2011-10-30T23:56:30  <avdg> roflmao: use it with a collision protection
2011-10-30T23:56:53  <avdg> it may actually win the game in some maps :-)
2011-10-30T23:57:03  <roflmao> it already has collision protection :)
2011-10-30T23:57:18  <roflmao> the problem is that the algorithm they use for going to squares is borked
2011-10-30T23:57:20  <avdg> at least, if they get enough food
2011-10-30T23:57:29  <roflmao> essentially it sort of has an internal manhattan heuristic
2011-10-30T23:57:40  <roflmao> so lets say food is 3 squares above me but there is wall seperating
2011-10-30T23:57:47  <roflmao> so the only movement actually INCREASES the heuristic
2011-10-30T23:58:03  <roflmao> so then next turn it will go right back to the previous spot since that spot decreases the heuristic
2011-10-30T23:58:13  <roflmao> creating an endless loop of failure (this is the tut bot not my code)
2011-10-30T23:58:22  <avdg> you need something that is always too optimistic ;-)
2011-10-30T23:58:29  <avdg> at least with a*
2011-10-30T23:58:51  <yoden> moving randomly, avoiding collisions, is surprisingly not 100% terrible
2011-10-30T23:58:58  <yoden> it's the tortoise approach xD
2011-10-30T23:59:02  <roflmao> lol yoden
2011-10-30T23:59:13  <roflmao> one thing that works surprisingly well for exploring is a bouncer
2011-10-30T23:59:19  <roflmao> move into one direction until you hit into wall
2011-10-30T23:59:23  <roflmao> change direction
2011-10-30T23:59:35  <roflmao> obviously you can get into a square of death
2011-10-30T23:59:39  <avdg> my bot is actually a bad bouncer
2011-10-30T23:59:47  <roflmao> no pathfinding whatsoever??
2011-10-30T23:59:52  <avdg> no
2011-10-30T23:59:54  <roflmao> dude
2011-10-30T23:59:55  <avdg> thats my next layer
