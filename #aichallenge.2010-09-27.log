2010-09-27T00:58:28  <Cyndre> I now have 9 wins with 1267 ranking - last guy was 860
2010-09-27T00:59:11  <Janzert> you were sort of unfortunate that your first 3 were all under 2000
2010-09-27T00:59:25  <Janzert> they're going to drag you down for a bit
2010-09-27T00:59:34  <Cyndre> you mean my first 3 were over 2000?
2010-09-27T00:59:56  <Janzert> well whichever way you're sorting it down from 1 or up :)
2010-09-27T01:00:20  <Cyndre> doing good, seen 1 bug though and want to see it lose so I can fix it
2010-09-27T01:00:37  <Cyndre> 99/100 dualbot and 96/100 ragebot

2010-09-27T01:00:51  <sigh> matching algorithm seems a bit screwed... I'm at 10th and in the 3 games I've played people ranked 981 and 876
2010-09-27T01:01:00  <sigh> Cyndre: not bad
2010-09-27T01:01:15  <sigh> to get the last few against ragebot, you need pretty specific code
2010-09-27T01:01:34  <Cyndre> it just ranked me against a 1600
2010-09-27T01:01:35  <sigh> not terribly urgent until you have other stuff sorted out, imo
2010-09-27T01:01:40  <Janzert> sigh: at least the algorithm checked into svn for the distributed servers is horrendous
2010-09-27T01:01:40  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4816199
2010-09-27T01:02:16  <sigh> Janzert: haven't looked at the code, what do they do?
2010-09-27T01:02:17  <Janzert> I'm hoping danielvf has actually already changed that but just not committed the change yet
2010-09-27T01:02:24  <Zannick> wow
2010-09-27T01:02:24  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4816199
2010-09-27T01:02:30  <Cyndre> sorry
2010-09-27T01:02:48  <Janzert> choose first player randomly then choose within +-20 *submissions*
2010-09-27T01:02:58  <Zannick> there can be planets 1 apart
2010-09-27T01:03:18  <sigh> what does "+-20 *submissions*" mean?
2010-09-27T01:03:54  <Janzert> choose the second player randomly from the 20 submissions before or after the first player chosen
2010-09-27T01:04:14  <sigh> Zannick: yeah... I've heard several times from admins that the python script guards against it, but I looked at the code and I can't see it
2010-09-27T01:04:18  <Zannick> Janzert: the ranked submission, you mean
2010-09-27T01:04:27  <Zannick> sigh: i examined it
2010-09-27T01:04:28  <sigh> it does have a guard against planets that are too close, but I don't see how it stops 1 distance planets
2010-09-27T01:04:34  <Zannick> it doesn't
2010-09-27T01:04:45  <sigh> cool, I'm not crazy :)
2010-09-27T01:04:58  <Janzert> no, just submission order from the way I'm reading it
2010-09-27T01:05:08  <Janzert> hopefully I'm wrong
2010-09-27T01:05:13  <Zannick> the too close guard goes off for 2 1-growth planets if they are closer than .8
2010-09-27T01:05:15  <Janzert> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/www/api_get_matchup.php?spec=svn376&r=376
2010-09-27T01:05:27  <Zannick> so, .85 distance is fine, distance 1
2010-09-27T01:05:45  <Zannick> furthermore, the guard isn't applied against the first three planets
2010-09-27T01:05:58  <sigh> Zannick: agree
2010-09-27T01:06:09  <FlagCapper> I have a feeling resubmiting my bot until I draw my first matchup with someone in the top 100 is going to be faster than waiting to play some games.
2010-09-27T01:06:20  <Zannick> so there is a .5454% chance that the starting planets are each 1 away from the center planet
2010-09-27T01:06:38  <Zannick> and a quarter of that possibility that the starting planets are 1 apart from each other!
2010-09-27T01:07:48  <sigh> Janzert: the submissions array is ordered by rank
2010-09-27T01:08:22  <Cyndre> oh god - I fought a guy lower then me and went up in rank.....
2010-09-27T01:08:36  <Zannick> yeah, active submissions, ordered by rank
2010-09-27T01:08:42  <Janzert> ahh, ok. I see now. I missed the last line of the query
2010-09-27T01:08:46  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T01:08:58  *** troutwine <troutwine!~user@74-46-239-233.dsl1-field.roch.ny.frontiernet.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-27T01:09:10  <Zannick> it's actually the inner select, sort within userid, max submission id from those
2010-09-27T01:09:15  <Zannick> but anyway
2010-09-27T01:09:32  <Janzert> not the "order by rank desc"?
2010-09-27T01:10:22  <Zannick> wait
2010-09-27T01:10:34  <Zannick> i'm looking at tournament_manager.py
2010-09-27T01:10:36  <Janzert> actually the only inner select I see is the max(leaderboard_id)
2010-09-27T01:10:57  <Janzert> ahh, yeah that is quite a bit different
2010-09-27T01:11:41  <Zannick> oookay
2010-09-27T01:11:53  <Zannick> i no longer know how he's picking matches
2010-09-27T01:12:40  <Zannick> anyway, i think i shall submit a fix for the map generator
2010-09-27T01:13:17  <Cyndre> should have an undefeated bot link on site that shows every bot with 0 loss's
2010-09-27T01:14:22  <Janzert> except it will encourage people to resubmit as soon as they get a loss
2010-09-27T01:14:53  <Cyndre> wow, I was 24 on tcp
2010-09-27T01:17:10  <sigh> undefeated doesn't mean anything unless you are #1
2010-09-27T01:17:29  <sigh> we already have a list for that :P
2010-09-27T01:19:50  * Janzert just noticed the rankings have broken past the 3000 elo point spread
2010-09-27T01:21:10  <sigh> what is the significance of that?
2010-09-27T01:22:04  <Janzert> nothing in and off itself, just the wider the spread the larger skill differential from top to bottom
2010-09-27T01:22:39  <sigh> i see
2010-09-27T01:23:02  <Janzert> 3000 means 6 steps where each step should beat the next 95% of the time
2010-09-27T01:23:33  <Janzert> get to 3500 and it's 7 :)
2010-09-27T01:24:32  <sigh> cool :)
2010-09-27T01:25:55  <sigh> so bots should beat opponents 500 points lower 95% of the time?
2010-09-27T01:26:00  <Janzert> hmm, it'd be interesting to see the elo spread from top rank to median rank over time
2010-09-27T01:26:21  <Janzert> in general yes, although any specific case will vary of course
2010-09-27T01:26:48  <Janzert> http://www.3dkingdoms.com/chess/elo.htm can give you the elo difference for any specific winning percentage
2010-09-27T01:26:52  <sigh> coo, I don't know much about elo... now I can make more sense of the ranks :)
2010-09-27T01:28:07  <Janzert> I don't think the rating change calculator part of that page will match well with what happens in the contest though since bayeselo is used and is quite a bit more complex
2010-09-27T01:30:24  <sigh> btw Janzert, what is your username in the tournament?
2010-09-27T01:30:52  <Janzert> Janzert, I just haven't made a submission yet :P
2010-09-27T01:31:12  <sigh> ah :)
2010-09-27T01:32:02  <Janzert> I did actually work on writing a bit of code for it last night though :)
2010-09-27T01:32:49  <Cyndre> and see up and comming bots
2010-09-27T01:33:09  <Cyndre> Janzert - of course make sure they cant duplicate upload
2010-09-27T01:33:10  <sigh> Janzert: the competition gets harder the longer you wait
2010-09-27T01:33:50  <Janzert> sigh: yes, it's starting to give me confidence that this game isn't to shallow
2010-09-27T01:34:03  <Janzert> another reason I like seeing the elo spread increase
2010-09-27T01:34:18  <sigh> Janzert: you thought otherwise?
2010-09-27T01:34:44  <Janzert> tron was easy to see that it reduced to a NP hard problem, this one isn't obviously that way
2010-09-27T01:34:57  <Cyndre> yea
2010-09-27T01:35:06  <Janzert> it could be that a relatively simple strategy dominated all others
2010-09-27T01:35:13  <Cyndre> Im upto 864 undefeated :)
2010-09-27T01:35:26  <Janzert> nice
2010-09-27T01:36:42  <sigh> Javache: yeah, this game is very intricate... I don't think anyone has a clear idea of what is good yet
2010-09-27T01:37:07  <sigh> well, maybe the bots right at the top... I can't speak for them
2010-09-27T01:37:10  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4816744   <--- thats whats good about it
2010-09-27T01:37:12  <Cyndre> :)
2010-09-27T01:37:58  <Janzert> yep, I was worried at first that after getting past the surface complexity of, basically, the high branching factor there might not be much depth
2010-09-27T01:37:59  <sigh> Cyndre: you are just bullying people :P
2010-09-27T01:38:34  <Janzert> :)
2010-09-27T01:38:52  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4815022 watch turn 18 to 31 for the sucker punch
2010-09-27T01:40:49  <Janzert> heh, looks a little dangerous though it worked quite nicely
2010-09-27T01:41:02  <Cyndre> how is it dangerous?
2010-09-27T01:41:28  <Cyndre> I send more cause clearly Im just not checking right - but get a planet for 3 ships, and the enemy loses 50
2010-09-27T01:41:54  <Janzert> all those ships completely committed from all the way across the map, no way to change your mind
2010-09-27T01:42:07  <Cyndre> 3 ships if done right
2010-09-27T01:42:13  <Janzert> but remember this is someone who has yet to write his first submission talking :)
2010-09-27T01:42:37  <sigh> nah, I agree with Janzert, but it would take a smarter bot than any currently out there to take advantage
2010-09-27T01:42:43  <Cyndre> but you see the one Im talking about - the center planet?

2010-09-27T02:20:37  <rwa> is there an invalid move on the server that tcp doesn't catch?

2010-09-27T04:05:26  <bhasker> nah should be a minor change, 2.5 doesn't have the PriorityQueue class so i just need to reimplement it using a heapq in 2.5
2010-09-27T04:05:39  <bhasker> or just change my code to use heapq instead of PriorityQueue
2010-09-27T04:05:52  <bhasker> i think thats the only thing in my code thats 2.6 specific

2010-09-27T04:35:49  <antimatroid> it's not about the map being asymetric, rather that the numbering of planets causes some to be picked before others
2010-09-27T04:36:04  <antimatroid> i assume that is what is causing some variation in results where one would expect them to be identical

2010-09-27T04:42:31  <antimatroid> have the players both think they're player 1, then engine swaps those moves to equivalent moves of player 2 and sends that information to the other bot, then engine arbitrarily has one player as 2 for it's own state information
2010-09-27T04:42:55  <antimatroid> so each player thinks they're in the position of player 1, with symmetric maps that should work
2010-09-27T04:43:19  <sigh> each player thinks they are player 1 right now...
2010-09-27T04:44:18  <antimatroid> then how do we get variation?

2010-09-27T04:44:50  <Naktibalda> cound you give an example of asymetry?
2010-09-27T04:44:56  <antimatroid> but my way they aren't different
2010-09-27T04:45:20  <antimatroid> Naktibalda: my bot performs differently against dual bot on map 44 dependent on which player it plays as
2010-09-27T04:45:31  <antimatroid> wins both these days, but it's a different game
2010-09-27T04:45:55  <antimatroid> dhartmei was saying the other day that he's seen such things a lot on tcp data
2010-09-27T04:45:59  <sigh> dualbot doesn't care about distance so it picks equal planets based on id
2010-09-27T04:46:35  <sigh> half the time it will make the stupid choice
2010-09-27T04:46:52  <antimatroid> exactly, so the planet id's should be reversed if it's player 2
2010-09-27T04:47:00  <antimatroid> such that it makes the "same" move
2010-09-27T04:47:06  <Naktibalda> oh, a special fix for dual bot :)
2010-09-27T04:47:06  <antimatroid> that's my point, to account for planet numbering
2010-09-27T04:47:17  <antimatroid> no, not for dual bot, that's an example
2010-09-27T04:47:38  <sigh> i see what your saying, I'm just not sure why it matters
2010-09-27T04:48:01  <antimatroid> because otherwise you might have 2 bots currently that would swap win/lose dependent on starting positions
2010-09-27T04:48:13  <antimatroid> i would say its then reasonable that they should be played from both starting positions
2010-09-27T04:48:22  <antimatroid> or use my method which forces symmetry in an extra way
2010-09-27T04:48:24  *** shades <shades!~shades@cheshire.telephreak.org> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-27T04:48:24  <sigh> they are the same starting positions
2010-09-27T04:48:37  <antimatroid> yes, but the planet numbering isn't symmetric
2010-09-27T04:48:40  <sigh> the planet ids are arbitrary and any reliance on them is the fault of the bot
2010-09-27T04:49:08  <antimatroid> yes, and i don't intend for mine to depend on it, but wouldn't it be nicer to eliminate such possible discrepencies anyway?
2010-09-27T04:49:18  <sigh> if the bot really wants, it can reorder the planet ids on internally
2010-09-27T04:49:40  <antimatroid> ignore what it means for bots, think about nice consistent correct results
2010-09-27T04:49:51  <Naktibalda> it duplicates load of servers just to make dulabot behave more consistently :)
2010-09-27T04:50:03  <antimatroid> it's not for dual bot
2010-09-27T04:51:39  * Naktibalda should tell something about people living at the bottom of Earth
2010-09-27T04:53:02  <antimatroid> i guess nobody else thinks that's a desirable property then
2010-09-27T04:53:14  <antimatroid> i would have thought maximising consistency would be desirable :\
2010-09-27T04:53:27  <antimatroid> even if it makes no difference for better bots
2010-09-27T04:54:12  <bhasker> i agree though that if on the same map switching positions causes a bot to lose
2010-09-27T04:54:14  <bhasker> something is wonky
2010-09-27T04:54:25  <antimatroid> it's the bots that are wonky in a way
2010-09-27T04:54:32  <bhasker> if maps are symmetrical switching positions shouldn't matter
2010-09-27T04:54:39  <antimatroid> but imo it's possible to eliminate that and it's really wouldn't be very computationally expensive
2010-09-27T04:54:52  <antimatroid> bhasker: it's to do with the numbering of planets
2010-09-27T04:55:03  <bhasker> hmm but i don't use the planet numbering in any way
2010-09-27T04:55:05  <antimatroid> at least that is my guess
2010-09-27T04:55:09  <bhasker> i am not sure why that should affect anything
2010-09-27T04:55:13  <antimatroid> yes you do, you iterate through them
2010-09-27T04:55:15  <bhasker> my bot has the same problem on 44
2010-09-27T04:55:30  <antimatroid> and dual bot picks differently on that
2010-09-27T04:55:37  <antimatroid> it wouldn't if done my way
2010-09-27T04:55:43  <bhasker> hmm though i don't really use the ordering in any meaningful way
2010-09-27T04:55:47  <bhasker> i iterate but build my own queue
2010-09-27T04:55:56  <bhasker> so the actual physical order doesn't matter
2010-09-27T04:56:03  <antimatroid> if you tie break, do you pick the first one you come across (or last, or any specific one for that matter)?
2010-09-27T04:56:05  <bhasker> i guess my bot just sucks on that map
2010-09-27T04:56:21  <bhasker> my queue is not based priorities
2010-09-27T04:56:39  <antimatroid> it's possible for a bot to change it's moves currently because of that, changing the engine would stop that
2010-09-27T04:56:40  <bhasker> hmm though its possible that it may affect
2010-09-27T04:57:18  <bhasker> how often does the official server match up bots?
2010-09-27T04:57:21  <bhasker> my bot got one game
2010-09-27T04:57:26  <bhasker> and then nothing for the last few minutes
2010-09-27T04:57:40  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3635), adumlah(3519), bix0r4ever(3505), Rexxar(3477), sequoh(3462), kcm1700(3454), davidjliu(3452), McLeopold(3419), sighbot(3375), vinx33(3369)
2010-09-27T04:57:46  <Naktibalda> few minutes or few hours?
2010-09-27T04:58:03  <antimatroid> yeah, the server is struggling this competition, they're working on that
2010-09-27T04:58:23  <Naktibalda> 1 game every 1 or 2 hours usually
2010-09-27T04:59:05  <bhasker> hmm seems to be faster than that
2010-09-27T04:59:13  <bhasker> i have 9 minutes between my games
2010-09-27T04:59:16  <bhasker> just got the second game
2010-09-27T04:59:34  <Naktibalda> oh,it's just a start
2010-09-27T04:59:41  <Naktibalda> my bot played 6 games in 12 hours
2010-09-27T04:59:56  <di> what place?
2010-09-27T05:00:32  <bhasker> i just uploaded my first working bot to the official server had to make the code 2.5 python compatible
2010-09-27T05:01:08  <bhasker> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=5822
2010-09-27T05:01:18  <antimatroid> i wouldn't take rankings on the main site as very accurate at this point
2010-09-27T05:01:27  <antimatroid> you just don't get enough games to generate anything reasonable
2010-09-27T05:01:52  <bhasker> the unofficial server anyway seems to have most of the good bots
2010-09-27T05:02:01  <Naktibalda> I think that bots after upload have a higher priority for first hour or something
2010-09-27T05:02:09  <bhasker> ooh k
2010-09-27T05:02:14  <bhasker> yea i just got my 3rd game

2010-09-27T05:05:38  <bhasker> isn't that yours?
2010-09-27T05:05:57  <sigh> haha... yeah, although I haven't used sigh-timeout for a while
2010-09-27T05:06:06  <sigh> that was when I was timing out all the time due to connection :P
2010-09-27T05:06:11  <bhasker> ah k
2010-09-27T05:06:18  <bhasker> i have improved my bot in the last two weeks
2010-09-27T05:06:26  <bhasker> it was quite dumb earlier, this is my best version yet
2010-09-27T05:06:30  <bhasker> seems to do decently
2010-09-27T05:06:45  <bhasker> one heuristic i need to build yet is when to acquire neutrals rather when not to
2010-09-27T05:06:49  <bhasker> my bot is too aggresive
2010-09-27T05:06:56  <bhasker> sometimes gets too behind on ships trying to acquire neutrals

2010-09-27T05:11:04  <sigh> it seems you've yet to win against my bot either :P
2010-09-27T05:11:11  <bhasker> which one is yours?
2010-09-27T05:11:25  <sigh> not playing right now, my bots are all sigh-*
2010-09-27T05:11:34  <sigh> but I've got logs from all the games my bot has played on tcp
2010-09-27T05:11:35  <bhasker> ah k
2010-09-27T05:11:48  <bhasker> well my earlier versions were rather dumb:-\
2010-09-27T05:11:53  <bhasker> this seems to be the best one yet
2010-09-27T05:12:02  <bhasker> so it might do better against your bots now
2010-09-27T05:12:02  <sigh> cool
2010-09-27T05:12:05  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T05:12:17  <bhasker> i had some basic bugs that i needed to work out
2010-09-27T05:12:18  <sigh> I'll try to put one up in a couple of hours
2010-09-27T05:12:22  <bhasker> with how i handled fleet resolutions
2010-09-27T05:12:35  <bhasker> my bot would send out ships when it should not have
2010-09-27T05:12:39  <bhasker> and lose a planet
2010-09-27T05:12:41  <bhasker> etc
2010-09-27T05:12:46  <sigh> yeah, I've had those problems too
2010-09-27T05:12:48  <bhasker> so took quite a few iterations to fix those bugs
2010-09-27T05:12:57  <bhasker> this one doesn't do any of that dumb crap
2010-09-27T05:13:13  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T05:13:27  <bhasker> though i still haven't gotten one bug worked out
2010-09-27T05:13:38  <bhasker> sending ships to capture neutral right after the enemy when my planet is closer
2010-09-27T05:13:46  <bhasker> for some reason my bot tends to launch the ships a bit too earl
2010-09-27T05:13:49  <bhasker> early*
2010-09-27T05:13:57  <bhasker> and ends up helping the enemy instead
2010-09-27T05:14:02  <bhasker> by wasting ships against the neutral:-\
2010-09-27T05:15:45  <sigh> I just explicitly forbid my bot from attacking neutrals closer to the enemy
2010-09-27T05:15:52  <bhasker> yea i need to do that
2010-09-27T05:15:57  <bhasker> though i have won matches
2010-09-27T05:15:59  <bhasker> when i do that too
2010-09-27T05:16:09  <bhasker> so i don't want it to be a strict heuristic
2010-09-27T05:16:14  <bhasker> rather strict command
2010-09-27T05:16:18  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-27T05:16:20  <bhasker> want a more flexibile heuristic
2010-09-27T05:16:27  <sigh> I wish that restriction was emergent from my heuristics too
2010-09-27T05:16:40  <sigh> it shows that my current heuristics are not that good
2010-09-27T05:16:47  *** espes <espes!~espes@2001:470:1f05:ca1::> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-27T05:16:55  <sigh> but every time I try to mess with the my bot does worse
2010-09-27T05:17:06  <bhasker> heh i added a similar heuristic at start of game
2010-09-27T05:17:12  <bhasker> i restrict the visible space to my bot
2010-09-27T05:17:14  <bartwe_> pingpong
2010-09-27T05:17:15  <bhasker> to 50% of the map
2010-09-27T05:17:18  <bhasker> hey bart
2010-09-27T05:17:27  <bhasker> and then expand it as the game progresses
2010-09-27T05:17:42  <bhasker> that way my bot doesn't do dumb stuff like sending ships across the map to some random planet
2010-09-27T05:17:53  <sigh> bhasker: haven't tried anything like that myself
2010-09-27T05:18:03  <bhasker> try it out
2010-09-27T05:18:08  <bartwe_> bhasker: i don't see why that wouldn't be emergent from your heuristic
2010-09-27T05:18:14  <bhasker> i tried that
2010-09-27T05:18:16  <bhasker> doesn't work:(
2010-09-27T05:18:16  <bartwe_> *couldn't
2010-09-27T05:18:23  <bhasker> my heuristic always gets wonky
2010-09-27T05:18:32  <bhasker> because some stupid planet is sitting with 3-4 production
2010-09-27T05:18:39  <bhasker> with a small number of ships on it
2010-09-27T05:18:43  <bhasker> and my bot would just go after it
2010-09-27T05:18:49  <bhasker> even if it was right next to the enemy
2010-09-27T05:19:17  <bhasker> i tried various heuristics but my bot would always do something like that
2010-09-27T05:19:20  <sigh> yeah, that's why my bot fails too... it under-estimates the strength of planets that can get easy reinforcements
2010-09-27T05:19:28  <bartwe_> then you need to adjust the expected valueof the capture with parameters related to worstcase/expected case income unde retaliation and such
2010-09-27T05:19:46  <bhasker> yea i need to but restricting the search space works quite well too
2010-09-27T05:19:54  <bhasker> since most maps are symmetrical
2010-09-27T05:19:58  <bartwe_> infact i lose due to being too cautious due to this and not capturing enough against more aggresive opponents
2010-09-27T05:20:12  <bhasker> happens to me at times
2010-09-27T05:20:25  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=bhaskerv20.1
2010-09-27T05:20:28  <sigh> yeah, atm my bot is quire defensive
2010-09-27T05:20:45  <bhasker> bart also i think your supply chain model needs a few changes
2010-09-27T05:20:53  <bhasker> adum's has perfected that model
2010-09-27T05:21:16  <bartwe_> relly ?
2010-09-27T05:21:24  <bhasker> yes
2010-09-27T05:21:27  <bhasker> check his games out
2010-09-27T05:21:33  <bhasker> its quite interesting
2010-09-27T05:21:37  <bhasker> what his bot does
2010-09-27T05:21:42  <bartwe_> i stopped using the hardcoded supply chain, and tried to make it emergent
2010-09-27T05:21:49  <bhasker> i implemented some of that stuff in my bot
2010-09-27T05:21:53  <bhasker> and its doing much better
2010-09-27T05:22:10  <bhasker> i think i understand what adum's bot does, its pretty similar to mine except his took it one step further
2010-09-27T05:22:12  <sigh> bartwe_: how did that work out?
2010-09-27T05:22:24  <bhasker> adum's bot uses a concept that i call staging planet
2010-09-27T05:22:30  <bhasker> it funnels everything to a staging planet
2010-09-27T05:22:35  <bhasker> and always attacks from there
2010-09-27T05:22:37  <bhasker> except
2010-09-27T05:22:41  <sigh> bhasker: mine does that too, but it is purely emergent
2010-09-27T05:22:46  <bhasker> the staging planet is not always its own planet
2010-09-27T05:22:55  <bhasker> he predicts which planet will be won
2010-09-27T05:22:56  <bartwe_> sigh: i later found a bug in my statging code
2010-09-27T05:23:00  <bhasker> in the next few turns
2010-09-27T05:23:00  <bartwe_> i can now make it stronger
2010-09-27T05:23:03  <bhasker> and uses that to stage
2010-09-27T05:23:07  <bhasker> and my bot does that too now
2010-09-27T05:23:15  <bartwe_> it fails to take into account where the staging planet is going to be at the time of arrival
2010-09-27T05:23:18  <bhasker> so instead of reacting after capturing the planet
2010-09-27T05:23:27  <bhasker> its proactive
2010-09-27T05:23:46  <bhasker> adum's bot does it much better than mine
2010-09-27T05:23:53  <bhasker> and i don't funnel ships from one to the other
2010-09-27T05:23:59  <bhasker> i tend to send them straight
2010-09-27T05:24:11  <bhasker> been debating if a spanning tree is more efficient or not
2010-09-27T05:24:21  <sigh> bartwe_ tried MST
2010-09-27T05:24:26  <sigh> I don't think it is good
2010-09-27T05:24:29  <bhasker> yea i tried it
2010-09-27T05:24:31  <bhasker> didnt work out
2010-09-27T05:24:35  <bhasker> when you lose planets at back
2010-09-27T05:24:39  <bhasker> reversing the flows
2010-09-27T05:24:40  <bhasker> is a pain
2010-09-27T05:24:45  <sigh> :P
2010-09-27T05:24:47  <bhasker> and you lose time
2010-09-27T05:24:55  <bhasker> with all your ships going in one direction or the other
2010-09-27T05:25:36  <sigh> this game is a good example of my "staging": http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4817924
2010-09-27T05:25:44  <bartwe_> i still think some level of intermediate stops are superior over sending straight
2010-09-27T05:26:01  <bhasker> so this is where sigh i was saying your staging needs improvement
2010-09-27T05:26:06  <bhasker> you are staging to aplanet you control already
2010-09-27T05:26:10  <bhasker> its better to send it further ahead
2010-09-27T05:26:14  <bhasker> to a planet you will take control off
2010-09-27T05:26:14  <sigh> yup, I know
2010-09-27T05:26:16  <bhasker> of*
2010-09-27T05:26:22  <bhasker> thats what adum's bot does
2010-09-27T05:26:25  <sigh> I tried, it is hard... project for later
2010-09-27T05:26:29  <bhasker> the other thing i realized watching his bot
2010-09-27T05:26:30  <bartwe_> bhasker: yeah i was planning to do that
2010-09-27T05:26:47  <bhasker> is he never waits to accumulate enough ships on one planet to capture a neutral
2010-09-27T05:26:55  <bhasker> he launches ships from closer planets as long as he has enough
2010-09-27T05:26:57  <bartwe_> infact in a timestep different planets could be sending to different staging tactics due to the relativity of time/distance
2010-09-27T05:27:00  <bhasker> and i did that
2010-09-27T05:27:06  <bhasker> and it actually works quite well
2010-09-27T05:27:18  <bhasker> so i do something similar
2010-09-27T05:27:35  <bhasker> i sort my planet list by distance from destination and launch ships going by proximity
2010-09-27T05:27:53  <bartwe_> bhasker: i would lauch sorted by expected value
2010-09-27T05:28:02  <bartwe_> which may be suboptimal

2010-09-27T05:28:25  <bhasker> i use two queues
2010-09-27T05:28:33  <bhasker> one is list of potential targets
2010-09-27T05:28:38  <bhasker> and the other is the list of available ships

2010-09-27T05:28:51  <bhasker> i sort my available list everytime by distance from each target
2010-09-27T05:28:53  <bhasker> as i pick up targets
2010-09-27T05:29:05  <bartwe_> expected value of a travel

2010-09-27T05:29:50  <mega1> bartwe_: batch of travels targeting the same planet?
2010-09-27T05:29:59  <bartwe_> no, any batch of travels
2010-09-27T05:30:08  <bartwe_> including future trvavels
2010-09-27T05:30:13  <mega1> got it
2010-09-27T05:30:25  <bartwe_> which is a bitch to calculate the budget requiriement for
2010-09-27T05:30:33  <bhasker> i never was very good at probability and expected values !
2010-09-27T05:30:35  <bhasker> :-\
2010-09-27T05:30:43  <bhasker> my heuristics are very simple :-\
2010-09-27T05:30:51  <bartwe_> bhasker: just do somethign so the bad < good < better
2010-09-27T05:31:01  <mega1> bartwe_: but you still evaluation is a sum of per planet scores, right?
2010-09-27T05:31:14  <bhasker> yup i do something like that
2010-09-27T05:31:14  <mega1> s/you still/your/
2010-09-27T05:31:15  <bartwe_> i now check dozends if attributes and future model
2010-09-27T05:31:20  <bartwe_> and i'm down at lvl 50 atm

2010-09-27T05:32:23  <bartwe_> i only model relative fitness with and without a batch of trvales
2010-09-27T05:33:26  <sigh> I can't figure out how you decide to start attacking :D
2010-09-27T05:33:32  <bhasker> my bot?
2010-09-27T05:33:36  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-27T05:33:53  <bhasker> as i said i increase the space ovetime
2010-09-27T05:34:00  <bhasker> so initially on some maps it won't even see the enemy
2010-09-27T05:34:10  <bhasker> as for attacking
2010-09-27T05:34:16  <bhasker> i have a concept that I call flow rate
2010-09-27T05:34:22  <bhasker> i use that to identify target planets
2010-09-27T05:34:36  <bhasker> and try to capture planets with highest flow rates

2010-09-27T05:35:03  <sigh> flow rate is a property of the planet?
2010-09-27T05:35:10  <bhasker> and the distance from my planets
2010-09-27T05:35:15  <bhasker> basically something liek
2010-09-27T05:35:18  <sigh> or depends on the state, is what I mean
2010-09-27T05:35:29  <sigh> ok, I see
2010-09-27T05:35:32  <bhasker> (production/distance to planet)*(200-TurnNumber)-dest.NumShips
2010-09-27T05:35:46  <sigh> yeah, I've been mucking around with something like that myself
2010-09-27T05:35:48  <bhasker> so it gives me a number as to how many ships that planet can provide
2010-09-27T05:35:51  <bhasker> over time
2010-09-27T05:35:51  <sigh> looking at centrality measures
2010-09-27T05:35:52  <bhasker> to my planets
2010-09-27T05:36:00  <bhasker> and i sum that number to each of my planets
2010-09-27T05:36:05  <bhasker> and use that order my list of targets
2010-09-27T05:36:15  <bhasker> then i factor in ships around the planet/ships incoming etc
2010-09-27T05:36:21  <bhasker> and decide if i have enough ships to capture it etc
2010-09-27T05:36:31  <sigh> I thinking looking to move 200 is problamatic
2010-09-27T05:36:43  <sigh> and artificial, unless in endgame
2010-09-27T05:37:23  <sigh> the 200 move limit doesn't matter until you are at least past 100, but more like 150
2010-09-27T05:37:25  <bhasker> well overall it works out quite well,except when sometimes in maps small planets which are closer
2010-09-27T05:37:30  <sigh> cool
2010-09-27T05:37:37  <bhasker> have an artificially inflated flow rate
2010-09-27T05:37:48  <bhasker> so my bot would end up picking the wrong planet to capture

2010-09-27T05:39:13  <antimatroid> huzzah i came up with something new to try :)
2010-09-27T05:39:50  <bhasker> does anyone know whose bots are these 9-/8- bots
2010-09-27T05:40:06  <antimatroid> FlagCapper i think
2010-09-27T05:40:18  <bhasker> he has so many versions running
2010-09-27T05:40:33  <antimatroid> i have a few usernames up
2010-09-27T05:40:43  <antimatroid> it's kind of nice when you've made some changes to get a new elo
2010-09-27T05:40:52  <antimatroid> i try to do it somewhat reservedly
2010-09-27T05:40:52  <bhasker> yea i do that too
2010-09-27T05:41:00  <bhasker> but not as much as these 8-/9-
2010-09-27T05:41:12  <bhasker> and i usually only run 1/2 bots at a time
2010-09-27T05:41:24  <antimatroid> should have accounts and just let people reset their elo if they want
2010-09-27T05:41:35  <antimatroid> but that involves effort
2010-09-27T05:41:51  <antimatroid> also wouldn't allow people to imitate bartwe so easily
2010-09-27T05:42:05  <bhasker> haha
2010-09-27T05:42:29  <antimatroid> apparently someone actually bothered aha
2010-09-27T05:42:55  <bhasker> bart which versions of your bots are currently active?
2010-09-27T05:43:01  <bhasker> i see an 8.2
2010-09-27T05:43:06  <bhasker> 12.2
2010-09-27T05:43:39  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure it was 10 or 12 that was the imposter
2010-09-27T05:43:43  <antimatroid> not sure if he is 12.2 or not
2010-09-27T05:43:53  <bhasker> heh
2010-09-27T05:44:37  <bhasker> how is this possible

2010-09-27T08:14:05  <BtbN> to store if i already reacted to that fleet
2010-09-27T08:14:23  <antimatroid> i store my own fleets, only adding new ones as i pass through the game state string
2010-09-27T08:14:26  <sigh> BtbN: just check for fleets which have length-turnsremaining = 1

2010-09-27T09:04:13  <Naktibalda> probably you compare a count of your ships against a enemy and it isn't enough to capture planet
2010-09-27T09:04:36  <BtbN> it should see that it has more than enough ships to take one of the two enemy planets

2010-09-27T09:16:06  <antimatroid> just put in my first 4 dimensional vector :|
2010-09-27T09:16:11  <antimatroid> i should really just use my tensor class
2010-09-27T09:16:55  <krokokrusa> don't forget about quaternions
2010-09-27T09:17:22  <sigh> you are using tensors in your AI? o_O
2010-09-27T09:18:02  <antimatroid> tensor in that it's just like an nD matrix
2010-09-27T09:18:20  <antimatroid> so say i take my 4d tensor, it just goes into that like there are 4 dimensions
2010-09-27T09:18:35  <antimatroid> then has a vector specifying the "length" of each dimension
2010-09-27T09:18:41  <antimatroid> and all values are stored on a 1d vector
2010-09-27T09:18:51  <antimatroid> use it for a game theory library i'm working on
2010-09-27T09:19:18  <elijahbal> antimatroid: I would to speak theory with you
2010-09-27T09:19:29  <antimatroid> ...?
2010-09-27T09:19:29  <elijahbal> So far I saw different approaches.
2010-09-27T09:20:04  <antimatroid> i'm not very knowledgable, i just think of stuff then start searching for anything relevant most of the time
2010-09-27T09:20:05  <elijahbal> 1 - is to have an heuristic to attack and defend against fleets. This heuristic is widely adaptable, but I didn't try to put it far.
2010-09-27T09:20:29  <elijahbal> 2 - is to use a graph
2010-09-27T09:20:45  <antimatroid> i haven't not thought about it as a graph in a long time
2010-09-27T09:20:51  <elijahbal> ai algorithms are often dealing with graphs
2010-09-27T09:21:25  <elijahbal> are you developping a matricial approach ?
2010-09-27T09:21:26  <antimatroid> although i don't store it as such, as you already know every node is connected to every other node, just store distances
2010-09-27T09:21:41  <antimatroid> not really, just useful way to think about it
2010-09-27T09:21:42  <elijahbal> antimatroid: true
2010-09-27T09:22:27  <elijahbal> the number of path is about (n-1)! if you consider a path can be used in the two directions
2010-09-27T09:22:54  <elijahbal> actually exactly (n-1)!
2010-09-27T09:23:07  <antimatroid> i haven't really made much use of graph theory algorithms, but i still find it the best way to think about the problem
2010-09-27T09:23:48  <elijahbal> Do you actually think that the problem is "path finding" problem ?
2010-09-27T09:24:20  <elijahbal> The matter is that this kind of graph doesn't fit with collaborative work between planets.
2010-09-27T09:24:20  <BtbN> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=9494 he realy shoul fix his bot
2010-09-27T09:25:05  <antimatroid> it's not really a path finding problem
2010-09-27T09:25:23  <elijahbal> What's the problem for you ?
2010-09-27T09:25:27  <antimatroid> but the problem is isomorphic to a graph theory one, so it's nice to just think of it in terms that I am used to
2010-09-27T09:25:33  <antimatroid> to win? :P
2010-09-27T09:26:14  <elijahbal> antimatroid: yes, but you win against someone else. The problem is to have an ai which can adapt to a broad quantity of situations.
2010-09-27T09:26:38  <antimatroid> yes, and that can all be encapsulated into the objective of winning :P
2010-09-27T09:27:10  <elijahbal> antimatroid: That's what I thought.
2010-09-27T09:27:38  <elijahbal> But actually, if you see it as a graph problem, it seems rather difficult because the complexity is far too big.
2010-09-27T09:27:43  <antimatroid> you might want to predict future states of planets based on known fleets if you aren't already
2010-09-27T09:27:58  <elijahbal> antimatroid: I already tried this approach.
2010-09-27T09:28:08  <elijahbal> It doesn't work perfectly.
2010-09-27T09:28:12  <antimatroid> people have found it quite successful
2010-09-27T09:28:17  <antimatroid> myself included
2010-09-27T09:28:28  <elijahbal> Yes, but you cannot use intermediate states.
2010-09-27T09:28:38  <antimatroid> intermediate?
2010-09-27T09:28:43  <elijahbal> eg, a planet is neutral with one ship.
2010-09-27T09:28:45  <antimatroid> it's a discrete game
2010-09-27T09:29:02  <antimatroid> what about a neutral planet with one ship?
2010-09-27T09:29:06  <BtbN> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=187646 seems like both bots decided that map sucks :D
2010-09-27T09:29:31  <elijahbal> Would you like to wait for your opponent to finish the work or get directly to the last neutral ship and keep the planet yours when the opponent already destroyed so many of his bots ?
2010-09-27T09:29:33  <antimatroid> i think they could have taken that 13 planet couldn't they?
2010-09-27T09:29:56  <antimatroid> depends on which generates you the most growth
2010-09-27T09:29:56  <BtbN> then they'd loose their home-planet, of the other bot is good
2010-09-27T09:30:20  <antimatroid> no, i mean i think they could do that without sending so many that the other person could take them
2010-09-27T09:30:32  <sigh> yeah, the better bots seem to determine how many ships they can use, and take over neutrals
2010-09-27T09:30:42  <antimatroid> they are distanced like 4 apart yeah? with 5 growth, that's 20 growth generated in the time to send a fleet there
2010-09-27T09:31:03  <elijahbal> Even they send just one more ship than needed to capture a planet.
2010-09-27T09:31:19  <elijahbal> You just have to wait one elapsed round and take the planet just after.

2010-09-27T09:33:32  <antimatroid> yeah, i wont touch an enemy planet from one of mine unless it's that planets closest enemy
2010-09-27T09:33:44  <elijahbal> It's a perfect move cause it draws a circle around the target, then he can use many ships to attack the target and send just the appropriate quantity.
2010-09-27T09:33:52  <antimatroid> although, that isn't optimal
2010-09-27T09:34:05  <antimatroid> consider when the enemy planet is on either side of you, you may want to take the one further away
2010-09-27T09:34:14  <antimatroid> enemy planets*
2010-09-27T09:35:12  <elijahbal> the dmj111 way seems to be an argumentation in favor of quick victories.
2010-09-27T09:35:52  <antimatroid> that could just be the result of his bot being much better than other current bots :p

2010-09-27T09:40:05  <elijahbal> the strategy is to send the more sheep possible to the center planets and keep them.
2010-09-27T09:40:15  <elijahbal> After that he send many ships on the biggest planets.

2010-09-27T09:46:36  <antimatroid> i saw the orginal premature post on reddit and was like zomg there goes my uni marks
2010-09-27T09:46:47  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T09:46:56  <antimatroid> i also made a bot for tron, which was easier
2010-09-27T09:47:00  <antimatroid> although awesome

2010-09-27T10:18:26  <elijahbal> dmj111 is first since a long time.
2010-09-27T10:18:39  <elijahbal> so what's the quickest path to victory ?
2010-09-27T10:18:54  <elijahbal> Define a strategy : less bad choice ?
2010-09-27T10:18:58  <elijahbal> better choice ?
2010-09-27T10:19:20  <elijahbal> no choice ?
2010-09-27T10:20:23  <Naktibalda> quickest path to create the  best bot? or to win a single game?
2010-09-27T10:22:26  <elijahbal> no to win a single game I mean
2010-09-27T10:23:01  <elijahbal> is it a good idea for you to focus on the growth rate ?
2010-09-27T10:23:22  <elijahbal> try to make your opponent growth rate smaller while you are trying to make yours higher ?
2010-09-27T10:23:51  <elijahbal> I'm talking about choice you know, it 's rather difficult to have an idea of the criteria used to be good in the game.
2010-09-27T10:24:06  <Naktibalda> just don't forget that if you have +10 grwoth_rate but opponent has +200 ships, he can take over your planets fast
2010-09-27T10:24:41  <elijahbal> Cause even if you define such a simple criteria, the choices are enormous.
2010-09-27T10:24:56  <elijahbal> so which planet could you attack : neutral, enemy ?
2010-09-27T10:25:06  <Naktibalda> enemy :)
2010-09-27T10:25:13  <elijahbal> fast growth rate, low num ship ?

2010-09-27T10:25:59  <Naktibalda> :)
2010-09-27T10:26:43  <HakanD_> thats the thing that makes this challenge interesting (:
2010-09-27T10:27:09  <elijahbal> which theoretical arsenal would you use ? graph theory ?
2010-09-27T10:28:14  <elijahbal> other ?
2010-09-27T10:28:35  <elijahbal> Neural Network are said not to be good. I would be doubtfull since it requires good variables to use.

2010-09-27T11:09:34  <Naktibalda> is it compatible with python 2.5
2010-09-27T11:10:13  <adesst> the latest submission started at Sep 27th 08:15:13, Sep 27th 09:52:55,Sep 27th 09:59:30 and yet i have not received any email that says "Compile Success"

2010-09-27T11:12:39  <Naktibalda> I think that it should be possible to add syntax checking for interpreted languages to compile_anything.py

2010-09-27T12:59:50  <coventry> I'm really struggling to understand the principles behind the dramatic reversal in this game between McLeopold and dmj111.  At move 56, McLeopold seems to be ahead in every way, then dmj111 stages this crazy invasion and wipes the board with him.  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4811861
2010-09-27T13:01:11  <a1k0n> McLeopold wasted too many ships capturing neutrals around turn 56
2010-09-27T13:01:53  <a1k0n> notice turn 57; as soon as the 72-fleet to the 71-size neutral shows up, dmj counterattacks
2010-09-27T13:06:07  <coventry> At turn 58, McLeopold had 922 ships (ignoring the fleet of 69 committed to the remote neutral.)  dmj had 960.  That's a 4-turn lead, given McLeopold's excess productive capacity of 10 ships per turn.  He's already made the deficit up three turns before dmj's first attack fleet lands.
2010-09-27T13:06:57  <coventry> I agree that McLeopold's committment to taking the neutrals is what triggered the attack from dmj, though.

2010-09-27T13:11:14  <coventry> But at turn 60, McLeopold's subsequent commitment of 83- and 91-ship fleets to other neutrals may have been the crucial blunder.  Thanks for pointing that out.

2010-09-27T14:02:07  <Migi32> I'd say do it, it's fun :D
2010-09-27T14:02:34  <Migi32> but be prepared to type retardedly slow for a while
2010-09-27T14:02:46  <HakanD> yep im aware of that (:

2010-09-27T14:04:18  <HakanD> best time to change is when doing extensive coding without a strict timeline i think
2010-09-27T14:04:21  <HakanD> which is now for me
2010-09-27T14:04:46  <Migi32> http://play.typeracer.com/ <- I used this
2010-09-27T14:05:27  <Migi32> also, if you'd use it to program a lot I'd suggest programmer dvorak
2010-09-27T14:05:46  <Migi32> basically the same except (){}[]:,; etc are all a lot more accessible
2010-09-27T14:06:47  <HakanD> yep saw that on wiki

2010-09-27T14:12:59  <HakanD> im changing all the things about my computer life, so i ll probably try dvorak as well
2010-09-27T14:13:14  <HakanD> I just need some stickers for keyboard (:
2010-09-27T14:13:22  <mightybyte> HakanD: I use dvorak
2010-09-27T14:14:31  <HakanD> mightybyte, wanna share your thoughts about changing from qwerty to dvorak-
2010-09-27T14:14:51  <mightybyte> Getting to a 60wpm didn't take long.
2010-09-27T14:15:05  <mightybyte> Getting up to 80-90 took much longer.
2010-09-27T14:15:20  <mightybyte> And I still haven't reached the speed that I used to type with qwerty.
2010-09-27T14:15:42  <mightybyte> But that speed took a LONG time to reach on qwerty.
2010-09-27T14:16:46  <Migi32> how long have you been using dvorak, mightybyte?
2010-09-27T14:16:52  <HakanD> So it worths investing that amount of time?
2010-09-27T14:16:54  <jmcarthur> i have heard that most people never reach their old qwerty speeds when they switch to dvorak, but that's not the point anyway
2010-09-27T14:16:58  <mightybyte> Probably 4-5 years.
2010-09-27T14:17:14  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Well, that was one of the main reasons I tried it.
2010-09-27T14:17:30  <delt0r_> I find that typing speed is just not something thats holding me back
2010-09-27T14:17:31  <mightybyte> HakanD: That depends on your motivation.
2010-09-27T14:17:34  <jmcarthur> the only reason i've ever considered it is to prevent strain on my hands
2010-09-27T14:17:44  <mightybyte> I've never had problems with strain.
2010-09-27T14:17:55  <Migi32> also HakanD, I'd say NO stickers. NO cheat sheets. I know it's annoying to memorize the keys but just do it. You'll learn much quicker afterwards
2010-09-27T14:18:01  <jmcarthur> nor i, but i know people who have, and i don't want that to happen to me
2010-09-27T14:18:12  <jmcarthur> actually, i have, but it's emacs' fault
2010-09-27T14:18:30  <mightybyte> Migi32: I'll second that.  If you're a hunt-and-peck qwerty guy, then switching to dvorak with no keyboard modifications would probably be a big benefit.
2010-09-27T14:18:31  <HakanD> Only reason im thinking about switching is the health reasons
2010-09-27T14:18:37  <delt0r_> emacs has a short cut for that ;)
2010-09-27T14:18:45  <jmcarthur> a quick remapping of the capslock key to control was all i needed to fix my problem
2010-09-27T14:19:17  <mightybyte> If I was going for speed, I don't think dvorak is the way to do it.  I'd probably come up with a custom keyboard layout for that.
2010-09-27T14:19:27  <jmcarthur> colemak might be a bit better for speed
2010-09-27T14:19:37  <jmcarthur> since it emphasizes "finger rolls" and stuff
2010-09-27T14:20:23  <elijahbal> better to switch before to have an health reason to do it.
2010-09-27T14:20:37  <jmcarthur> it also preserves some of your keyboard shortcuts from qwerty, but i don't know if i care much about that
2010-09-27T14:20:50  <HakanD> Thanks for the info
2010-09-27T14:21:07  <jmcarthur> elijahbal: exactly my thinking
2010-09-27T14:21:15  <jmcarthur> although i still haven't made the switch
2010-09-27T14:21:18  <Migi32> ah yes, that was the reason I chose programmer dvorak over regular dvorak, the x c and v keys are in the same spot
2010-09-27T14:21:41  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Colemak is designed with finger rolls in mind?  I've never heard that.
2010-09-27T14:21:41  <Migi32> no wait they aren't XD
2010-09-27T14:21:53  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: at least in part
2010-09-27T14:22:15  <mightybyte> All I've seen is preserving zxcv and symbols.
2010-09-27T14:22:23  <Migi32> ah yes, it's like this: while I hold control, it switches back to qwerty
2010-09-27T14:22:28  <HakanD> im going for dvorak

2010-09-27T14:23:15  <HakanD> tired of cumbersome ides
2010-09-27T14:23:33  <mightybyte> HakanD: I found that the easiest way to use vim with dvorak was to not do any key remapping.
2010-09-27T14:23:40  <elijahbal> else vim is designed to make your own shortcuts.
2010-09-27T14:23:59  <elijahbal> mightybyte: sure ?
2010-09-27T14:24:05  <mightybyte> elijahbal: For me, yes.
2010-09-27T14:24:19  <mightybyte> l and h are pretty intuitive for left and right movement.
2010-09-27T14:24:34  <mightybyte> (although slightly less convenient than their qwerty positions)
2010-09-27T14:24:57  <mightybyte> It wasn't too hard to re-learn jk
2010-09-27T14:25:31  <mightybyte> Although I must say that even though I can still type pretty well on qwerty, using vim in qwerty is tough.

2010-09-27T14:30:57  <elimisteve> it's great except for copying and pasting, as was mentioned earlier
2010-09-27T14:31:32  <elimisteve> I did it to reduce the RSI (repetitive stress injure) I was beginning to develop
2010-09-27T14:31:47  <elimisteve> and it worked. The other main thing though was capswap
2010-09-27T14:32:12  <HakanD> k, switched to dvorak, and typing this took around 2 3 mins :)
2010-09-27T14:32:17  <elimisteve> L-Ctrl and Caps Lock are swapped
2010-09-27T14:32:21  <elimisteve> ha right
2010-09-27T14:32:28  <elimisteve> it's slow at first but I now type 85 wpm
2010-09-27T14:32:53  <elimisteve> it took a few months to match my QWERTY speed
2010-09-27T14:33:07  <mightybyte> HakanD: You should start with some tutorial which introduces the keys incrementally to let you build up familiarity with them.
2010-09-27T14:33:24  <HakanD> yep im gonna to that
2010-09-27T14:33:25  <elimisteve> setxkbmap dvorak option ctrl:swapcaps
2010-09-27T14:33:30  <HakanD> just wanted to try (:
2010-09-27T14:33:44  <mightybyte> HakanD: How fast do you type in qwerty?
2010-09-27T14:33:47  <elimisteve> that enables dvorak and swaps l-ctrl with caps lock in Linux
2010-09-27T14:34:07  <HakanD> 90-100 tops
2010-09-27T14:34:14  <HakanD> but that was 4-5 months ago
2010-09-27T14:34:21  <HakanD> im a bit slow right now
2010-09-27T14:34:30  <HakanD> didnt typed a lot (:
2010-09-27T14:35:12  <HakanD> after reading a lot about rsi, i decided to take action early
2010-09-27T14:35:25  <mightybyte> HakanD: Ok.  I would guess that you should be able to get 40 or so wpm on dvorak with a few hours effort (or less).

2010-09-27T16:59:59  <boegel> I'm seem to be losing multiple games due to time-outs (don't think it's invalid moves, I checked that)
2010-09-27T17:00:45  <boegel> but, when I replay the game using parse_game_state_url.py, I see the bot process all the game states in less than 50ms
2010-09-27T17:01:14  <boegel> while a time-out should only occur when I spend more than 1s in some turn, right?
2010-09-27T17:01:26  <JensTi> boegel: you can also time out if you send bad commands
2010-09-27T17:01:31  <boegel> is the server still susceptible to 'freak' time out?
2010-09-27T17:01:33  <JensTi> like sending from planets that do not belong to you
2010-09-27T17:01:44  <boegel> JensTi: yes, I know, I'm pretty sure I don't do that
2010-09-27T17:01:46  <JensTi> or sending more ships then there are on a planet
2010-09-27T17:02:32  <boegel> JensTi: yes, I'm aware of all that, but my best guess now is a freak server time-out, to be honest
2010-09-27T17:03:06  <JensTi> boegel: if the time out is on the 1st turn, then yes
2010-09-27T17:03:50  <boegel> JensTi: even then
2010-09-27T17:04:16  <boegel> JensTi: the server could become very busy doing other stuff during any given turn, which would screw up the time-out mechanism imho
2010-09-27T17:04:26  <boegel> JensTi: not sure how many measures have been taken against that

2010-09-27T17:05:47  <boegel> can some admin check whether this was a time-out or an invalid move?

2010-09-27T17:51:56  <amstan> boegel: i have no idea how
2010-09-27T17:52:02  <boegel> amstan: is it indeed a time-out of my bot, or something else?
2010-09-27T17:52:08  <boegel> amstan: ah, you can' check?
2010-09-27T17:52:24  <boegel> s/can'/can't/
2010-09-27T17:52:31  <boegel> I assumed you're one of the admins :)
2010-09-27T17:53:12  <Janzert> boegel: unless someone changed it recently I don't think the server records how a game ended
2010-09-27T17:53:23  <boegel> Janzert: ah :(
2010-09-27T17:53:26  <amstan> boegel: i am, but idk how
2010-09-27T17:54:25  <boegel> I just find it really, really strange, because the exact same bot playing at the TCP server doesn't time out at all
2010-09-27T17:55:22  <BtbN> If the server is under heavy load, a simple calculation might take forever and cause a timeout
2010-09-27T17:55:25  <Janzert> have you tried testing locally with the same version of haskell as is on the contest server?
2010-09-27T17:55:33  <BtbN> it realy should check for CPU-Time, and not real time
2010-09-27T17:55:34  <Janzert> maybe it's a version difference?
2010-09-27T17:56:08  <Janzert> CPU time has it's own problems too
2010-09-27T17:56:17  <jmcarthur> not as vast as wall clock time has though
2010-09-27T17:56:27  <boegel> Janzert: I was thinking the exact same thing now
2010-09-27T17:57:20  <Janzert> personally I think ideal is wall clock time on servers dedicated to only running a game at a time

2010-09-27T17:58:18  <Janzert> actually ideal is dedicated server per player
2010-09-27T17:58:24  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-27T17:59:06  <jmcarthur> with identical specs, of course
2010-09-27T17:59:06  <Janzert> but then you also need to make sure servers are matched and both on same local network as engine server
2010-09-27T17:59:38  <Janzert> and of course each step is way more resource intensive
2010-09-27T17:59:47  <Janzert> :(
2010-09-27T17:59:55  <jmcarthur> something like the tcp server but with an army of dedicated, local bot servers rather than individual home machines
2010-09-27T18:00:05  * Janzert nods
2010-09-27T18:00:16  <jmcarthur> each bot server would just cycle through a list and connect to the main server for matches
2010-09-27T18:02:01  <Naktibalda> 1 server per bot, right?
2010-09-27T18:02:19  <Naktibalda> we all want more games
2010-09-27T18:02:26  <Janzert> well 1 bot per server at least

2010-09-27T18:18:04  <bhasker_> confused how is it that on certain maps my bot can beat my own bot only in one position
2010-09-27T18:18:17  <bhasker_> i would expect my bot to draw everytime
2010-09-27T18:18:31  <delt0r___> bug or hidden randomness
2010-09-27T18:18:47  <delt0r___> ie some order is important somewhere (like say fleets)
2010-09-27T18:18:54  <delt0r___> Thats my guess
2010-09-27T18:19:10  <bhasker_> hmm
2010-09-27T18:19:21  <Janzert> also planet order is given the same for both players
2010-09-27T18:19:41  <delt0r___> Or you go through planets left to right... and that affects behavour ie how ties are broken

2010-09-27T18:21:16  <delt0r___> I have some randomness by the fact that i iterate through a hash map
2010-09-27T18:21:31  <BtbN> one has the better starting-position for the strategy they use
2010-09-27T18:21:39  <delt0r___> but player 1 and 2 would be roughly even however

2010-09-27T18:22:54  <BtbN> for me they looked quite random o_O
2010-09-27T18:22:56  <delt0r___> so far
2010-09-27T18:23:16  <BtbN> my bot allways managed to beat himself

2010-09-27T18:23:30  <BtbN> and i'm not using any random stuff
2010-09-27T18:23:43  <delt0r___> Each planet is placed --then 180deg around the center another identical planet is placed
2010-09-27T18:24:10  <BtbN> + one center planet?
2010-09-27T18:24:12  <delt0r___> however that could lead to different rounding behavour for distances

2010-09-27T18:25:34  <BtbN> it even did so in it's simple version
2010-09-27T18:25:43  <Naktibalda> watch a game and find differences :)
2010-09-27T18:26:00  <Naktibalda> capture of central planet breaks symetry
2010-09-27T18:26:05  <BtbN> they do a complete differnnt beginning

2010-09-27T18:26:26  <Naktibalda> then your bot is unpredictable :)
2010-09-27T18:26:52  <Naktibalda> can you repeat a game? is result the same?
2010-09-27T18:27:08  <BtbN> yep, all games are fully repeatable
2010-09-27T18:27:26  <Naktibalda> record game to file and upload it so we can see it
2010-09-27T18:27:29  <BtbN> wasn't there a "game-pastbin" somewhere?

2010-09-27T18:27:36  <delt0r___> I don't think fleet orders are the same between players...
2010-09-27T18:27:54  <delt0r___> ie player 1 is always first... but thats player 2 for player 2...
2010-09-27T18:28:15  <BtbN> Naktibalda: does it understand the log.txt of the cpp-visualiser?
2010-09-27T18:28:23  <bhasker_> hmm
2010-09-27T18:28:29  <Naktibalda> redirect to file instead of visualizer

2010-09-27T18:28:42  <BtbN> the visualizer is all-in-one
2010-09-27T18:29:14  <JensTi> BtbN: there are rounding errors in the distance
2010-09-27T18:29:17  <Naktibalda> if it's the same as log.txt of playGame then no
2010-09-27T18:29:29  <BtbN> nah, it does not take it
2010-09-27T18:29:31  <BtbN> wait a second
2010-09-27T18:29:42  <BtbN> stupid windows cmd.exe
2010-09-27T18:29:47  <BtbN> need bash
2010-09-27T18:30:00  <Naktibalda> JensTi: in map or in bot code?
2010-09-27T18:31:58  <JensTi> in bot code
2010-09-27T18:32:10  <BtbN> Naktibalda: http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/71
2010-09-27T18:32:19  <BtbN> it's symetric at the beginning
2010-09-27T18:34:07  <JensTi> BtbN: that's because you do a for loop over a collection somewhere ?
2010-09-27T18:34:45  <BtbN> yeah, a lot of them
2010-09-27T18:34:51  <BtbN> foreach-loops
2010-09-27T18:34:55  <BtbN> but no random maps or so
2010-09-27T18:35:09  <JensTi> if you somewhere select the 1st entry in the list and ignore the rest it may give some random effects
2010-09-27T18:35:26  <BtbN> only in the list of owned planets
2010-09-27T18:36:16  <JensTi> because if the list is sorted in some way, so that the first and second planet have the same amount of troops f.ex
2010-09-27T18:36:31  <JensTi> you might end up with first planet a in bot 1 and planet b in bot 2
2010-09-27T18:36:50  <JensTi> because memory allocation is kind of random
2010-09-27T18:36:52  <BtbN> i can't realy find the first move they desync

2010-09-27T18:38:13  <JensTi> because it is closer to blue he gets there first and has spawned more fighters before red arives
2010-09-27T18:38:18  <JensTi> so there they desync
2010-09-27T18:38:53  <JensTi> so an optimalisation might be to check the distance to the planet you send to, and first send to the closest ;)
2010-09-27T18:38:54  <BtbN> hm, so it's because they both pick the planet with the lower ID, and it's closer to bot 1
2010-09-27T18:39:00  <JensTi> yep
2010-09-27T18:39:13  <BtbN> i should sort the list by distance to home-plane

2010-09-27T18:39:33  <JensTi> uhu, in theory
2010-09-27T18:39:50  <JensTi> but in practice you will be faster just doing a check somewhere in the for loop
2010-09-27T18:39:55  <JensTi> instead of sorting the whole thing
2010-09-27T18:40:41  <JensTi> do you sort on troops? or do a loop over all?
2010-09-27T18:40:42  <BtbN> it's quite stupid, it goes through the NotMine-Planets, and attacks the first one he has enough ships for to attack
2010-09-27T18:41:09  <Itkovian> BtbN: You should combine forces from several planets
2010-09-27T18:41:10  <BtbN> and this list is sorted by id
2010-09-27T18:41:30  <BtbN> Itkovian: if the bot would work as intended there wouldn't be any forces outside the base-planet :D
2010-09-27T18:41:34  <JensTi> BtbN: the way i work is by computing some sort of score for every notmine planets
2010-09-27T18:41:40  <BtbN> did not yet figure out why it sometimes forgetts some
2010-09-27T18:41:50  <JensTi> based on number of fleets, then distance, then wether neutral or owned by other
2010-09-27T18:42:06  <JensTi> and pick the biggest in there
2010-09-27T18:42:35  <BtbN> yeah, i thought about something like that already
2010-09-27T18:44:56  <BtbN> yeah, i see the place in my code where it fails
2010-09-27T18:45:06  <BtbN> some scoring-algorithm should fix it
2010-09-27T18:48:46  <BtbN> yep, they draw now
2010-09-27T18:48:47  <BtbN> nice
2010-09-27T18:49:47  <BtbN> wow, and it also beats RageBot now
2010-09-27T18:52:44  <justin_pdx> Naktibalda: I wrote a bot that did things randomly once.  It's possible to have non-repeatable matches.  But you can always view a specific games output.
2010-09-27T18:53:13  <Naktibalda> I know that it's possible, but that's not very common
2010-09-27T18:53:27  <justin_pdx> For good reason.  Ask me how well that bot did.
2010-09-27T18:54:27  <Naktibalda> choosing random target from top 3 targets has no advantages against choosing top target (except unpredictability)

2010-09-27T20:38:52  <Cyndre_> now the real question is "Is contestbot sanitary?"
2010-09-27T20:39:06  <justin_pdx> contestbot: Are you sanitary?
2010-09-27T20:39:07  <contestbot> justin_pdx: User error -- Replace user.
2010-09-27T20:39:35  <Cyndre_> if you accept hex inplace of integer what are the chances that your sanitary?
2010-09-27T20:40:53  <jesionaj> it working for hex doesnt mean too much
2010-09-27T20:41:19  <jesionaj> most languages (and presumably sql) accept multiple formats for numbers
2010-09-27T20:41:45  <Cyndre_> should really be hard coded - only integers

2010-09-27T20:42:05  <jesionaj> but 0x0f is an integer

2010-09-27T21:12:11  <Janzert> you should be able to see any fleets destination

2010-09-27T21:25:07  <Naktibalda> I fixed some bugs later: + I didn't check what improvements where done by lcsoft
2010-09-27T21:27:25  <Cyndre_> oh god, Im starting to rewrite my bot from scratch
2010-09-27T21:27:34  * Cyndre_ slaps self
2010-09-27T21:28:50  <u1tr0n> now i will delete all files which made last 2 days, after that im killing myself and after respawn will start a new bot ;)
2010-09-27T21:32:53  <Sylph> it's pretty addicting, Cyndre_
2010-09-27T21:33:13  <Sylph> should be doing other things, but i keep reloading to see how my latest iteration of bot is doing
2010-09-27T21:33:33  <Cyndre_> Sylph: well my bot only plays one turn at a time and makes some generalizations with turns - time to just make it exact
2010-09-27T21:33:37  <Sylph> xah
2010-09-27T21:33:58  <Cyndre_> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=3911
2010-09-27T21:34:16  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-27T21:34:30  <Sylph> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=9697 is mine, i just resubmitted
2010-09-27T21:34:43  <Sylph> already fixed a minor bug, but not enough to make me resubmit
2010-09-27T21:35:00  <Sylph> I noticed that the top ranked aren't playing like us, cyndre
2010-09-27T21:35:11  <Cyndre_> ?
2010-09-27T21:35:26  <Sylph> they build up their forces at key planets
2010-09-27T21:35:34  <Sylph> rather than expand and expand
2010-09-27T21:35:59  <Naktibalda> a style of top bots is changing constantly
2010-09-27T21:36:03  <Sylph> veery true
2010-09-27T21:36:08  <Cyndre_> Slyph: it depends on game state
2010-09-27T21:36:08  <Sylph> that's the point of this competition after all
2010-09-27T21:36:14  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T21:36:22  <Sylph> I don't have game state set up yet
2010-09-27T21:36:25  <Cyndre_> Sylph: once they have more growthRate they send to closest planet to enemy
2010-09-27T21:36:31  <znutar> Is the tcp server thing down right now?
2010-09-27T21:36:43  <Sylph> yep i noticed that, cyndre
2010-09-27T21:36:48  <Sylph> i stabilize at 300 last time. should get to 250 this time.
2010-09-27T21:36:51  <Naktibalda> znutar: no

2010-09-27T21:37:00  <Sylph> I might bother adding game state  and stuff sometimes,
2010-09-27T21:37:04  <Cyndre_> but my last bot was made to win - not have more ships in 200 turns (rather small time frame)
2010-09-27T21:37:08  <Sylph> But I want to rewrite the entire code. :/
2010-09-27T21:37:21  <Sylph> but got no time
2010-09-27T21:37:39  <Sylph> I'm somewhat curious how my bot would do against yours
2010-09-27T21:37:39  <Sylph> mm
2010-09-27T21:37:42  <Sylph> but yeah
2010-09-27T21:37:48  <znutar> Naktibalda: thanks, I guess I'm doing something wrong!
2010-09-27T21:37:54  <sigh> Cyndre_: don't need to have more growth rate before sending forces to the frontlines
2010-09-27T21:37:55  <Naktibalda> Sylph: you have 2 months left
2010-09-27T21:37:59  <Sylph> I just started yesterday
2010-09-27T21:38:05  <Sylph> it's a very amusing game
2010-09-27T21:38:09  <Sylph> and time consuming
2010-09-27T21:38:15  <Naktibalda> znutar: IP was changed a week ago, if you was away for some time :)
2010-09-27T21:38:25  <Sylph> took 6 hours trying to get a visualizer.... ended up switching to java from c# >.>
2010-09-27T21:38:29  <Sylph> coz I wanted my visualizer
2010-09-27T21:38:53  <Cyndre_> sigh: it also depends on ship count
2010-09-27T21:39:01  <Sylph> naturally
2010-09-27T21:39:02  <sigh> not really
2010-09-27T21:39:07  <sigh> Cyndre_: it's just a consequence of the fact that ships are better positioned closer to your enemy than away
2010-09-27T21:39:18  <Sylph> yep
2010-09-27T21:39:21  <Sylph> it's useful for defense
2010-09-27T21:39:28  <Sylph> or attacking
2010-09-27T21:39:34  <sigh> regardless of who's ahead or behind
2010-09-27T21:39:50  <sigh> if your forces are at the back you can't attack or defend effectively
2010-09-27T21:39:51  <Cyndre_> so you just send them to your most central planet?
2010-09-27T21:39:52  <Sylph> noticed it helped a lot on defense for some of the top ranked
2010-09-27T21:39:56  <sigh> Cyndre_: no
2010-09-27T21:40:05  <Cyndre_> map central?
2010-09-27T21:40:08  <Cyndre_> is what I meant
2010-09-27T21:40:34  <Sylph> my bot plays like me lol
2010-09-27T21:40:44  <sigh> not necessarily, just that your forces should be in the areas where they can attack/defend against the enemy the best
2010-09-27T21:40:52  <sigh> that is not necessarily one planet
2010-09-27T21:41:03  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T21:41:20  <sigh> but is definitely not at the back
2010-09-27T21:41:29  <sigh> you *must* move ships forward, and fast
2010-09-27T21:41:33  <Sylph> like a recording of dmj split his force into 3 planets after he attacked
2010-09-27T21:41:37  <Sylph> and got 4 planets
2010-09-27T21:41:43  <sigh> otherwise your opponent can easily advance
2010-09-27T21:41:55  <Cyndre_> yea
2010-09-27T21:42:00  <Cyndre_> thats probably my main issue
2010-09-27T21:42:12  <Sylph> I don't bother doing that myself yet
2010-09-27T21:42:18  <Sylph> my bot is simple
2010-09-27T21:42:27  <Sylph> what's best to attack or defend, attack or defend them
2010-09-27T21:42:28  <sigh> don't get me wrong, this is easy enough to say, but tricky to put into practice
2010-09-27T21:42:41  <Cyndre_> start with the gameState Sylph, you will have to eventually
2010-09-27T21:42:46  <Sylph> I should
2010-09-27T21:42:49  <Sylph> was lazy
2010-09-27T21:42:52  <Sylph> i wanted to put one in
2010-09-27T21:42:56  <Sylph> then i kept adding to it
2010-09-27T21:43:00  <Cyndre_> sigh: nah, will have to be based on grouping of ships and distance between them
2010-09-27T21:43:11  <Sylph> I have queued stuff I need to do on a total rewrite
2010-09-27T21:43:13  <Cyndre_> thats what I did
2010-09-27T21:43:14  <Cyndre_> lmao
2010-09-27T21:43:16  <Sylph> like gamestate
2010-09-27T21:43:33  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T21:43:39  <Cyndre_> so instead of trying to add state later on, Im working on gameState right now
2010-09-27T21:43:39  <sigh> Cyndre_: sorry, I don't understand
2010-09-27T21:43:43  <Cyndre_> and then Ill build on top of it
2010-09-27T21:44:03  <Cyndre_> sigh: based on the distance between my planets and the enemys and the ships at enemys and on my planet
2010-09-27T21:44:25  <Cyndre_> sigh: my bot loses on 2 rage bot maps for the same reason (doesnt make sure it can defend against ships in range)
2010-09-27T21:44:32  <sigh> i see, yeah
2010-09-27T21:44:35  <Sylph> but you know, the game state have somewhat limited use to some level.
2010-09-27T21:44:36  <Cyndre_> sigh: litterly 2 ships short
2010-09-27T21:44:39  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T21:44:43  <Sylph> i mean
2010-09-27T21:44:57  <Sylph> if you keep ahead  of the enemy from the beginning
2010-09-27T21:45:00  <Sylph> and keep them in check
2010-09-27T21:45:04  <Sylph> you can easily get rank 300s
2010-09-27T21:45:11  <sigh> I do most of my redistribution based purely on distance
2010-09-27T21:45:14  <Sylph> or probably 200-300s
2010-09-27T21:45:19  <Cyndre_> I was ranked 150 yesterday
2010-09-27T21:45:25  <Cyndre_> Im going for double digits
2010-09-27T21:45:28  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-27T21:45:34  <Sylph> yeah i might consider it
2010-09-27T21:45:42  <sigh> once you've stopped expanding to neutrals, the positions of planets seem to matter much more than growth rate
2010-09-27T21:45:42  <Cyndre_> been trying to add state and my bots got worse, thus the rewrite
2010-09-27T21:45:46  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T21:46:52  <davidjliu> it's really aggravating how many matches end any meaningful interaction around turn 50 and then just consist of people building up...
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Cyndre_> its a waste to expand glutonously to neutrals
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> glutonously, yes
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <sigh> Cyndre_: agree, it is a balance
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> but not always
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> i test new iteration of bots on older bots first, and dump changes that make it worse :p
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Cyndre_> the balance is between your ships, your growth, and his ships, his growth
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> lol davidjliu
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> rank 1-100?
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <sigh> davidjliu: all my local tests against different versions of my bots have started doing this :(
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> that don't sound like rank 300-1000 matches
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <sigh> it makes it really hard to test
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> or rank 200-300
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> ow sigh
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> what rank are you now ?
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Cyndre_> davidjliu: I wish it was to the death, I personally dont feel 200 turns is enough to do anything
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <sigh> @rankings
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> @rankings
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> eh :p
2010-09-27T21:47:50  <Sylph> tricked me
2010-09-27T21:47:51  <Cyndre_> davidjiliu: if you waste ships expanding even with double the growth you might now catch up in a short time frame

2010-09-27T21:48:13  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-27T21:48:16  <Sylph> nice
2010-09-27T21:48:20  <Sylph> i didn't notice
2010-09-27T21:49:01  <sigh> got some lucky wins :)
2010-09-27T21:49:01  <Sylph> my bot wasting time fighting low ranked -_-
2010-09-27T21:49:07  <Sylph> taking time to get to its previous rank
2010-09-27T21:49:07  <davidjliu> this is very true... my bot just likes the idea of hoarding ships
2010-09-27T21:49:11  <Sylph> which annoys me about uploading
2010-09-27T21:49:16  <Sylph> new bots
2010-09-27T21:49:42  <Sylph> mine doesn't :/

2010-09-27T21:50:09  <Sylph> that's the latest fight >.>
2010-09-27T21:50:10  <sigh> davidjliu: mine's more stupid, mine likes to hoard ships, and it doesn't even have any idea when it is behind
2010-09-27T21:50:24  <sigh> so it hoards even when doing so will obviously lose ><
2010-09-27T21:50:27  <Sylph> ah :/
2010-09-27T21:50:27  <Sylph> go update it
2010-09-27T21:50:28  <Sylph> ?
2010-09-27T21:51:02  <davidjliu> ha
2010-09-27T21:51:02  <davidjliu> vs:

2010-09-27T21:51:02  <davidjliu> heh, mine does too...
2010-09-27T21:51:02  <davidjliu> I actually don't do aynthing with the current gamestate
2010-09-27T21:51:02  <sigh> easier said than done :)
2010-09-27T21:51:03  <Sylph> yea
2010-09-27T21:51:03  <Sylph> i want a bot that write itself
2010-09-27T21:51:03  <Sylph> so i can do other things while it does that
2010-09-27T21:51:03  <sigh> but yeah, that's on the todo list
2010-09-27T21:51:03  <Sylph> I have to refactor my entire code to not be based on the dumb starter package
2010-09-27T21:51:05  <Sylph> Right now its pretty dumb
2010-09-27T21:51:29  <Sylph> ROFLMAO davidjliu
2010-09-27T21:51:32  <Sylph> that's funny
2010-09-27T21:51:55  <Sylph> I se your code send your ships to the closest planet that's closest to enemy.
2010-09-27T21:51:57  <Sylph> from each planet
2010-09-27T21:52:08  <Sylph> vinx33 send theirs straight to the middle
2010-09-27T21:52:17  <Sylph> why are you hoarding lol
2010-09-27T21:52:22  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-27T21:52:37  <davidjliu> yeah... enemy ships scare me a lot, I think
2010-09-27T21:52:38  <Sylph> you got more units
2010-09-27T21:52:40  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T21:52:46  <sigh> my bot is overly defensive
2010-09-27T21:52:52  <davidjliu> I'm pretty sure I wait till I have twice as many ships...
2010-09-27T21:52:56  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T21:53:26  <Sylph> bacck to 321, wonder how far that little bit of code will push it, hrm.
2010-09-27T21:53:51  <davidjliu> ha sigh, concrete example: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4824268
2010-09-27T21:53:54  <Cyndre_> davidjliu?: Im looking at that and planning on using my tot ships - his tot ships as ships for taking neutral planets when Im in the lead
2010-09-27T21:54:30  <Sylph> maybe consider adding some allowance, cyndre.
2010-09-27T21:54:32  <davidjliu> ha, the problem with taking neutral planets is always that you might pay for the startup and the enemy just takes it...

2010-09-27T22:05:16  <Cyndre_> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4868025   very nice game
2010-09-27T22:05:58  <blbrown_win3> is 200 turns pretty average for a game.  It seems kind of low
2010-09-27T22:05:58  <sigh> Cyndre_: well done
2010-09-27T22:06:13  <sigh> Cyndre_: also you should try attacking the closer planets first
2010-09-27T22:06:15  <Cyndre_> Im rarely hitting 200 turns
2010-09-27T22:06:29  <Cyndre_> sigh: its an algoritm based on distance, ships, and growth rate :)
2010-09-27T22:06:57  <sigh> Cyndre_: yeah mine too, but I've found that it should favor distance more than I thgouht

2010-09-27T22:08:28  <Sylph> had to fix some infinite loop a couple times, good thing there's a visualizer.
2010-09-27T22:08:30  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T22:08:45  <Cyndre_> was a good match and Im kinda currious how the last 58 turns would have played out

2010-09-27T22:08:59  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T22:09:07  <Sylph> on a different map
2010-09-27T22:09:28  <Cyndre_> lmao, yea maps make a big diff on this one
2010-09-27T22:09:31  <Sylph> I need to fix the defensive routine.
2010-09-27T22:09:37  <Sylph> my defensive routine is very very very dumb
2010-09-27T22:10:00  <Sylph> But that's going to be a little bit of work :|
2010-09-27T22:10:05  <sigh> mine just locks ships onto a planet... and that's about it :D
2010-09-27T22:10:09  <Cyndre_> I started writting reinforcePlanet2 and it showed me why I need better state
2010-09-27T22:10:25  <Cyndre_> my first reinforcePlanet just sent ships till the enemy landed
2010-09-27T22:10:27  <Cyndre_> very bad
2010-09-27T22:10:30  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T22:10:30  <Sylph> ow
2010-09-27T22:10:33  <sigh> heh
2010-09-27T22:10:43  <davidjliu> fun fact... I'm pretty sure I timed out on three of my last four losses. I was probably going to lose at least two anyways, but... it's just annoying
2010-09-27T22:10:44  <Sylph> that would be bad
2010-09-27T22:10:46  <Cyndre_> so bad it actually performed better with it turned off
2010-09-27T22:10:51  <Sylph> if you fix that, you should stabilize at 300 or better
2010-09-27T22:10:56  <Sylph> at least

2010-09-27T22:14:00  <Cyndre_> bugs
2010-09-27T22:14:14  <Sylph> i win everything against those bots. :/
2010-09-27T22:14:44  <Cyndre_> not many people use ragebots style - only encounter that 600+
2010-09-27T22:15:13  <sigh> Cyndre_: sure, but what you learn from countering ragebot is important
2010-09-27T22:15:33  <sigh> don't optimise your bot against ragebot, that's not what I'm saying
2010-09-27T22:15:35  <sigh> :P
2010-09-27T22:15:37  <Cyndre_> sigh: my biggest issue is timing from what I have seen
2010-09-27T22:15:51  <sigh> timing of what?
2010-09-27T22:16:11  <Cyndre_> when ships are going to land - I generalize
2010-09-27T22:16:14  <Sylph> all those basic bots are so easy to beat though sigh :/
2010-09-27T22:16:23  <Cyndre_> how many turns Sylph?
2010-09-27T22:16:29  <Sylph> which stage
2010-09-27T22:16:36  <Cyndre_> all of them
2010-09-27T22:16:39  <Sylph> has been as f ast as 26 turns in a couple
2010-09-27T22:16:51  <Sylph> i can't say all of them xd
2010-09-27T22:16:54  <Sylph> ask which bot and which map
2010-09-27T22:16:55  <Sylph> :p
2010-09-27T22:16:55  <Cyndre_> I average 55 and lose twice to ragebot on map 22 and 30
2010-09-27T22:17:02  <Sylph> that's nice
2010-09-27T22:17:20  <Cyndre_> greghaynes wrote a nice script for testing against all of them
2010-09-27T22:17:26  <Sylph> rage bot dies within 34 turn on map 22 for me
2010-09-27T22:18:01  <Sylph> interesting on map 88. seems that's going to end up a draw
2010-09-27T22:18:10  <Sylph> nm, i win barely
2010-09-27T22:18:14  <Sylph> -_-
2010-09-27T22:18:22  <Cyndre_> 42 turns I die on 22
2010-09-27T22:18:22  <Sylph> Thanks for telling me a map that my bot is weak on
2010-09-27T22:18:34  <Sylph> i won on 165 turns, that's so slow :/
2010-09-27T22:18:58  <Cyndre_> map 30 I lose on turn 200

2010-09-27T22:20:10  <Sylph> i lost on 88, that bs hrm
2010-09-27T22:20:15  <Cyndre_> I hate waiting for match's
2010-09-27T22:20:24  <Sylph> same
2010-09-27T22:20:56  <Naktibalda> Sylph: have you tried all maps?
2010-09-27T22:21:05  <Sylph> no, but that gets tiring
2010-09-27T22:21:09  <Sylph> and takes a while
2010-09-27T22:21:10  <Naktibalda> :)
2010-09-27T22:21:10  <blbrown_win3> with Java, does the system support java packages when I upload?

2010-09-27T22:21:57  <Sylph> thanks
2010-09-27T22:23:05  <Sylph> i still need to try out the tcp too
2010-09-27T22:23:06  <Sylph> and stuff
2010-09-27T22:23:20  <Sylph> i just started doing this yesterday >.>
2010-09-27T22:24:53  <greghaynes> Nah, I dont have the python script, I have the GUI for the tcp server
2010-09-27T22:25:03  <greghaynes> Rather, the real time game visualizer
2010-09-27T22:25:16  <greghaynes> I just use bash + find to test against all maps/bots

2010-09-27T22:25:56  <Cyndre_> oh, dimitri has the script
2010-09-27T22:25:58  <Cyndre_> sorry

2010-09-27T22:30:10  <Sylph> that python thing takes a while
2010-09-27T22:30:36  <Naktibalda> it's 100 games per bot, try to do it faster manually :)
2010-09-27T22:30:45  <Sylph> :p
2010-09-27T22:30:50  <Cyndre_> not sure if its edited, but if you open test.py and ctrl-f 1000 1000 replace with 200 200 it will be like the game
2010-09-27T22:30:54  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T22:31:10  <Sylph> I'm not sure what to do if someone is next to me, hrm.
2010-09-27T22:31:14  <Sylph> just wait them out and attack them ? :/
2010-09-27T22:32:10  <Cyndre_> Sylph: seems how you brought it up - MyPlanetShips + (MyPlanetGrowth * distance(MyPlanet, Enemy)) - EnemyShips = avalships

2010-09-27T22:32:38  <Sylph> True I can do that hrm
2010-09-27T22:33:18  <Cyndre_> and then it gives you some ships to send out the first turn, and if the enemy dedicates them all you can either take main planet or dedicate more to expansion

2010-09-27T22:34:18  <Sylph> from what i have it atm
2010-09-27T22:34:27  <Cyndre_> you mentioned it which gave me the idea on how to fix my last two maps ragebot beats me up
2010-09-27T22:34:33  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T22:34:36  <sigh> Cyndre_: 200 200 is a 200 move game with 200ms timeout

2010-09-27T22:37:05  <Cyndre_> and from rank 224 I descend
2010-09-27T22:37:42  <Naktibalda> to what position?
2010-09-27T22:37:57  <Naktibalda> my bot dropped to 156, before upload
2010-09-27T22:38:03  <Cyndre_> 227
2010-09-27T22:38:24  <Naktibalda> I hope that the new version will climb to top50 :)
2010-09-27T22:39:41  <Sylph> I think i'll just add that routine to my current defensive routine, cyndre.
2010-09-27T22:39:47  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-27T22:39:53  <Sylph> and loop through enemy planets >.>
2010-09-27T22:39:56  <Sylph> this is so wasting resources
2010-09-27T22:40:19  <Cyndre_> Sylph: I have a ship dispatcher that makes sure I dont do bad things
2010-09-27T22:40:22  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T22:40:35  <Sylph> I've been lazy
2010-09-27T22:40:36  <sigh> Sylph: I have loops like that all over the place :D
2010-09-27T22:40:38  <Sylph> just added up to that one function
2010-09-27T22:40:44  <Sylph> and forget stuff
2010-09-27T22:41:03  <Sylph> that would make my code nicer looking and modular
2010-09-27T22:41:06  <Sylph> okay then sigh :p
2010-09-27T22:41:24  <Sylph> I copied the data on enemy planets, etc
2010-09-27T22:41:42  <Sylph> so I don't have to keep requesting:/
2010-09-27T22:42:23  <sigh> I also found it handy to compute stuff like planets sorted by distance once and store it, because i keep using it

2010-09-27T22:45:44  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T22:46:09  <davidjliu> could you, like, actually fix that?
2010-09-27T22:46:42  <j3camero> davidjliu: yep, it's a big issue that I am spending a lot of time worrying about. It seems like there is a lot of timing out going on lately.
2010-09-27T22:46:55  <sigh> is that just because of server load?
2010-09-27T22:47:09  <j3camero> Are the timeouts spread evenly across all the bots, or is it just some languages more than others?
2010-09-27T22:47:21  <j3camero> sigh: the cause is unknown. Probably just my shitty code.
2010-09-27T22:47:28  <sigh> ah :(
2010-09-27T22:47:45  <davidjliu> aw...
2010-09-27T22:48:08  <Cyndre_> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4870130  wtf
2010-09-27T22:48:21  <davidjliu> lol
2010-09-27T22:48:26  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T22:48:30  <j3camero> haha I could probably fix it in a day, but I am starting a new full-time job. If it wasn't for the other volunteers, there would be very little contest to speak of, haha.
2010-09-27T22:49:10  <j3camero> despite the timeouts, are you finding you're able to get a more or less fair ranking? Or are ALL your games timing out?
2010-09-27T22:49:10  <Sylph> funny switching, Cyndre_
2010-09-27T22:49:19  <Sylph> none of my games are timing out xD
2010-09-27T22:49:36  <j3camero> Sylph: which language?
2010-09-27T22:49:39  <Sylph> hmm
2010-09-27T22:49:40  <Sylph> wait
2010-09-27T22:49:46  <Sylph> i use java atm
2010-09-27T22:49:47  <davidjliu> I've had, like, three of my games time out, I think.
2010-09-27T22:49:48  <Sylph> let me check last 12 matches
2010-09-27T22:49:57  <j3camero> davidjliu: out of how many?
2010-09-27T22:50:31  <amstan> j3camero: zomg, you're on irc
2010-09-27T22:50:35  <davidjliu> actually, it was 4, but out of a lot
2010-09-27T22:50:40  <j3camero> amstan: oh snap!
2010-09-27T22:50:44  <davidjliu> one of them was a long time ago and I think that one was probably legit
2010-09-27T22:50:51  <davidjliu> but I just had three in quick succession today
2010-09-27T22:51:00  <j3camero> davidjliu: oh that is good news. I officially care much less now (in favor of other issues, of course)
2010-09-27T22:51:09  <Sylph> okay, http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4867246 is timed out ?
2010-09-27T22:51:29  <j3camero> amstan: sorry I am not spending as much time on the contest as I should be. I got drafted to be the CTO of a political campaign.
2010-09-27T22:51:29  <Sylph> only 87 turns, enemy last planet hasn't turned color
2010-09-27T22:51:40  <davidjliu> my bot always strategically times out when it has no planets left
2010-09-27T22:51:44  <Sylph> how do you know if things time out
2010-09-27T22:51:50  <Sylph> lol david
2010-09-27T22:51:55  <Sylph> i mean, other than it ending half way
2010-09-27T22:52:22  <Sylph> like some games end with enemy planets all gone
2010-09-27T22:52:25  <sigh> davidjliu: your bot errors when there are no planets? mine was doing that before I fixed
2010-09-27T22:52:27  <Sylph> some seems to have the last planet still
2010-09-27T22:52:32  <Cyndre_> davidjliu: if planets.length() >= 1 :)
2010-09-27T22:52:50  <davidjliu> yeah, I don't really care, cuhz I'm probably going to lose anyways
2010-09-27T22:53:04  <davidjliu> and I have no idea why I spelled that cuhz...
2010-09-27T22:53:05  <j3camero> davidjliu: username?
2010-09-27T22:53:18  <Sylph> I use 		for (Planet p : myPlanets) {   :/
2010-09-27T22:53:27  <sigh> j3camero: he's just davidjliu, he's #3 :P
2010-09-27T22:53:31  <Sylph> so if it don't exist well, it don't go anyway :|
2010-09-27T22:53:31  <Sylph> mm
2010-09-27T22:53:34  <j3camero> makes sense.
2010-09-27T22:53:36  <Sylph> or does java not work like that
2010-09-27T22:53:47  <Sylph> nm, it s same thing
2010-09-27T22:53:56  <Sylph> so i don't get why you'd get time out >.<
2010-09-27T22:54:14  <j3camero> davidjliu: are you finding it's competitive at the top of the leaderboard? Like, do you really believe that your bot is solildly in third place? Or is there a bit of random noise there?
2010-09-27T22:54:24  <davidjliu> um... I think it's pretty random a lot
2010-09-27T22:54:35  <davidjliu> as in, I was like six earlier I think
2010-09-27T22:54:40  <davidjliu> and then I sat there for a few hours
2010-09-27T22:54:42  <sigh> I think dmj111 is a pretty clear first
2010-09-27T22:54:47  <davidjliu> (without playing any games)
2010-09-27T22:54:51  <Sylph> yeah somehow,
2010-09-27T22:54:53  <davidjliu> and I think I just became third
2010-09-27T22:54:55  <Sylph> I need to rewrite my entire code anyway hrm
2010-09-27T22:55:03  <Sylph> maybe i'll forget fixing this bot
2010-09-27T22:55:05  <Sylph> and just rewrite :|
2010-09-27T22:55:27  <davidjliu> like I've been third for a while, but it's just cause I haven't played anyone in a while
2010-09-27T22:55:31  <j3camero> davidjliu: my biggest fear is that the top 10 have basically found "the best strategy" and that there are very few gains left to have. Can someone from the top address this concern? Are there still lots of improvements to be had?
2010-09-27T22:55:37  <davidjliu> each game between teams at the top change a alot
2010-09-27T22:55:38  <sigh> j3camero: no way
2010-09-27T22:55:43  <davidjliu> I think there are still lots of improvements, yeah...
2010-09-27T22:55:48  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T22:55:54  <Sylph> i saw dmj complaining about a lot of things they are going to fix
2010-09-27T22:55:56  <Sylph> in the forum :p
2010-09-27T22:55:59  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-27T22:56:04  <Sylph> about their bot
2010-09-27T22:56:10  <sigh> no one still has a clear idea of what is best
2010-09-27T22:56:19  <j3camero> That's great news!
2010-09-27T22:56:33  <j3camero> I'm glad Phil Hassey found me and pitched Galcon as the game for this contest.
2010-09-27T22:56:37  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T22:56:48  <sigh> yeah, it's a good game
2010-09-27T22:56:51  <sigh> nice choice :)
2010-09-27T22:56:59  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T22:57:04  <j3camero> I really had no idea if it was going to be "deep" enough. You know what I mean?
2010-09-27T22:57:04  <sigh> I'm really enjoying it :D
2010-09-27T22:57:11  <sigh> yeah
2010-09-27T22:57:18  <Sylph> the best games are often the simplest or vice versa. :p
2010-09-27T22:57:25  <Sylph> would have been more confusing if you go do eufloria :p
2010-09-27T22:57:30  <dmj111> i think there is still a way to go to find the _best_ strategy... but I do wonder how long it will take someone to find it.
2010-09-27T22:57:35  <jmcarthur> honestly, the fact that we had no idea whether it would be deep was compelling to me
2010-09-27T22:57:38  <amstan> j3camero: i'm pretty unsatisfied with the state of stuff, there's lots of things to be done, so many things fail to work
2010-09-27T22:57:40  <sigh> so far, I haven't been able to apply many "traditional" AI techniques
2010-09-27T22:57:48  <sigh> this honestly requires thinking about strategy a lot
2010-09-27T22:57:49  <contestbot> Top 10 players: dmj111(3678), adumlah(3510), davidjliu(3489), Rexxar(3479), sequoh(3477), sighbot(3451), bix0r4ever(3429), kcm1700(3410), McLeopold(3378), vinx33(3378)
2010-09-27T22:57:54  <amstan> people are still complaining about the cpu time vs wall time, we did not get an answer for that
2010-09-27T22:58:05  <j3camero> I made the shallowness mistake a while back when we did a Rock Paper Scissors contest. It got to the point where all the top bots were the same basically. There is only so good you can get at RPS.
2010-09-27T22:58:19  <davidjliu> oh yeah, and is it still a rule that timing out results in a suspension from the official competition?
2010-09-27T22:58:39  <jmcarthur> RPS is very well researched, too
2010-09-27T22:58:58  <j3camero> davidjliu: no, timeouts just make you lose the game.
2010-09-27T22:59:11  <davidjliu> like, in the official contest too? cause apparently it was different for tron...
2010-09-27T22:59:11  <sigh> j3camero: that's good
2010-09-27T22:59:34  * Naktibalda just dropped down by 107 positions without playing any game
2010-09-27T22:59:36  <j3camero> amstan: yeah, I hear that. Sorry again for being AWOL. I am lucky to even get this half-hour to chat in IRC. I am swamped.
2010-09-27T23:00:06  <amstan> j3camero: there's still lots of things to do, it's not at the point where it can run itself
2010-09-27T23:00:15  <j3camero> amstan: I know.
2010-09-27T23:00:35  <amstan> most things require your decisions
2010-09-27T23:00:41  <amstan> but like.. look at the forums
2010-09-27T23:00:44  <j3camero> okay
2010-09-27T23:00:55  <amstan> it's full of people just complaining about stuff
2010-09-27T23:01:11  <amstan> about how they can't change their profile, and how they timeout inexplicably, or how it's all slow
2010-09-27T23:01:28  <Sylph> I was looking about changing profile and yeah noticed the rare matches
2010-09-27T23:01:42  <amstan> not to mention password reset requests
2010-09-27T23:01:47  <amstan> emails for the forums still don't work
2010-09-27T23:02:09  <amstan> making every little guy who forgets his password to try to contact anyone and post in as many places as possible
2010-09-27T23:03:20  <dmj111> > Sylph : you saw me complaining in the forums?  maybe someone else?
2010-09-27T23:03:42  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~quassel@cpc2-heme6-0-0-cust884.9-1.cable.virginmedia.com> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-09-27T23:04:36  <j3camero> amstan: yep. As usual, the contest pretty much sucks, hehe.
2010-09-27T23:04:39  <Sylph> not me
2010-09-27T23:04:43  <Sylph> i haven't posted in the foru
2010-09-27T23:04:44  <Sylph> m
2010-09-27T23:04:46  <jmcarthur> actually, it was this guy that pitched galcon first: http://eu.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bxfnk/what_game_should_we_pick_for_the_next_google_ai/c0p1w68
2010-09-27T23:04:49  <Sylph> i barely started doing this yesterday
2010-09-27T23:05:28  <Sylph> I got a large list of code to do to push my code to top 25. :/
2010-09-27T23:05:32  <davidjliu> the contest is wonderful
2010-09-27T23:05:34  <Sylph> unfortunately got a lot of things to do
2010-09-27T23:05:35  <j3camero> amstan: the political campaign thing should wind down in a few days from now. Then I will be able to renew a push to make the contest not suck. We are closer than ever to having a more-or-less flawless contest. It's definitely achievable.
2010-09-27T23:05:38  <Sylph> :|
2010-09-27T23:06:09  <dmj111> Sylph:  my bad... i mixed your comment about how I want to fix my code with the discussion about people having problems in the contest.  the "complain" word is all I saw.  Sorry.
2010-09-27T23:06:11  <jmcarthur> yeah i have been distracted by many things. i'm so glad the deadline this time around is so much farther away
2010-09-27T23:06:15  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-27T23:06:26  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T23:06:34  <Sylph> I saw you mentioning how you wanted to improve your bot on the next iteration or something
2010-09-27T23:06:46  <Sylph> though it might be a few iterations ago
2010-09-27T23:07:05  <dmj111> that was today... i am avoiding trying to figure out what to do next right now :)
2010-09-27T23:07:08  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-27T23:07:12  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T23:07:16  <Sylph> i have assignments to do
2010-09-27T23:07:20  <Sylph> I have to rewrite my entire code -_-
2010-09-27T23:07:32  <Sylph> Need to stuff an actual brain into it
2010-09-27T23:07:38  <Sylph> But need to do other things first
2010-09-27T23:07:57  <j3camero> dmj111: hey, it's nice to see you around! How are you liking (or not liking) the contest?
2010-09-27T23:08:18  <dmj111> hey j3camero .... Of course I won't complain right now :)
2010-09-27T23:08:18  <j3camero> dmj111: you're pretty solidly in first place. Do you think you'll get taken down, or do you have enough new ideas that you can stay on top?
2010-09-27T23:08:26  <dmj111> definitely get taken down.
2010-09-27T23:09:00  <j3camero> dmj111: do you mind telling me a bit about where you're from? University student, full-time software engineer, ...?
2010-09-27T23:09:27  <dmj111> the odds are low that I will win, but I hope to stay in the mix.   I have a few ideas that might make a big difference.. but I think over the course of two months other people will top it.
2010-09-27T23:09:55  <dmj111> np, full time programmer.  BS and MS in math, lots of interest in computer science.
2010-09-27T23:10:14  <j3camero> Awesome. Which field do you work in?
2010-09-27T23:10:51  <dmj111> I worked for 10 years in defense contractors, and the last two in a commercial company developing business applications.
2010-09-27T23:11:07  * jmcarthur got tired of defense contracting after only two years
2010-09-27T23:11:10  <j3camero> Sounds interesting, haha!
2010-09-27T23:11:19  <j3camero> I guess we dont have much of that in Canada.
2010-09-27T23:11:59  <dmj111> well,   I guess the first five were fun because it was at a nice research type place.  The next five were fun cause I had a lot of responsibility, but got tired of how  things were managed.
2010-09-27T23:12:23  <jmcarthur> i enjoyed the researchiness of the job i had, but i got tired of the material anyway
2010-09-27T23:13:01  <dmj111> re the contest:  i am having a lot of fun.  I am amazed at the number of people you have ,and the fact that you are keeping everything moving.  hats off to all of the volunteers running this.
2010-09-27T23:13:08  <j3camero> I work in Finance at the moment. I am quite enjoying it. It's very researchy. My job is to sit at my desk all day and play with huge datasets.
2010-09-27T23:13:38  <Cyndre_> sounds enjoyable
2010-09-27T23:13:46  <sigh> cool :)
2010-09-27T23:13:53  <dmj111> sounds fun.  do you right custom software for that, or use anything in particular.... or can't say :)
2010-09-27T23:14:06  <j3camero> dmj111: are you protecting your strategy, or do you mind sharing the general approach that you're taking?
2010-09-27T23:15:09  <j3camero> dmj111: yeah, I write tons of Python scripts usually. I use very little pre-made software, because most of it is not up to the task, or is very expensive. It boils my blood when a bank pays 100,000 per year for a piece of software that is basically just grep.
2010-09-27T23:15:18  <dmj111> well, I was thinking about writing stuff up eventually (sooner than later to help beginners out)... and unfortunately, it is complex enough I cannot predict what it will do.
2010-09-27T23:15:24  <Sylph> lol j3, thaat's bad.
2010-09-27T23:16:09  <dmj111> yep... I have pushed python pretty hard to my coworkers for years.  "you can do that in python" is kind of my catch phrase.
2010-09-27T23:16:23  <j3camero> dmj111: I would seriously encourage you to produce some content, even if it's just a few short blog posts. I think that would be amazing.
2010-09-27T23:16:30  <jmcarthur> j3camero: so what does one need to do to sell grep to a finance corporation for 100K/year? ;)
2010-09-27T23:16:41  <dmj111> jmcarthur: excellent question..
2010-09-27T23:16:50  * dmj111 would like to do that...
2010-09-27T23:16:53  <j3camero> jmcarthur: it's obscenely easy, hehe.
2010-09-27T23:16:59  <jmcarthur> dmj111: i asked first!
2010-09-27T23:17:11  * dmj111 waits his turn...
2010-09-27T23:17:28  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T23:17:32  <Sylph> i'll take the next turn then
2010-09-27T23:17:47  <j3camero> it's usually done the standard way. You sell it to managers somehow without consulting any technical people seriously.
2010-09-27T23:17:48  * sigh patents the idea and waits...
2010-09-27T23:17:51  <Sylph> with that kind of 'job', I'd be able to actually work on this fun competition code
2010-09-27T23:18:35  <jmcarthur> okay, so we just need a complicated gui for grep that will make managers go "wow"
2010-09-27T23:18:52  <sigh> jmcarthur: don't remember to be full buzzword compliant
2010-09-27T23:19:00  <sigh> *don't forget
2010-09-27T23:19:01  <jmcarthur> goes without saying
2010-09-27T23:19:07  <Zannick> grep <search term> internet
2010-09-27T23:19:34  <sigh> is it web-scale?
2010-09-27T23:19:44  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T23:19:46  <jmcarthur> it's cloud-scale
2010-09-27T23:19:51  <Zannick> my company does a pretty good grep O:-)
2010-09-27T23:20:05  <j3camero> dmj111: producing content that is accessible to self-taught hobbyists is a noble cause. Part of the reason I like running these contests is because it makes learning CS fun. At least hundreds of people could be said to be gaining skills through this contest. They bring those skills to their schools and workplaces, and make the world a better place. So I would highly encourage you to create some tuts or other spill-the-beans content.
2010-09-27T23:20:23  <dmj111> here is my strategy in a nutshell... attack neutrals when it is completely safe, look into the future and see if i can take planets away from the enemy.  The competing parts of figuring out safety and figuring what I can take is the hard part, and I am not sure how the two always fit together.

2010-09-27T23:20:29  <Sylph> I want a c# visualizer, j3camera :/
2010-09-27T23:20:35  <dmj111> none of that is probably surprising...
2010-09-27T23:20:37  <Sylph> Tempting to write one :|
2010-09-27T23:20:56  <Sylph> but would be nice if someone make it and I can use it :/
2010-09-27T23:21:03  <Sylph> I had to move to java, rather than have fun with C# -_-
2010-09-27T23:21:26  *** antimatroid <antimatroid!~Nick@196.221.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-27T23:21:29  <dmj111> j3camero: arm twist.... i should start working on it... cause when my bot starts clinking down the ladder, i will be motivated to work on it again.
2010-09-27T23:21:30  <Janzert> Sylph: look around the forums I thought someone had done that, but maybe I'm misremembering
2010-09-27T23:21:34  <jmcarthur> how is the visualizer influencing your choice of language, Sylph?
2010-09-27T23:21:42  <Sylph> heavily, jmcarthur
2010-09-27T23:21:48  <Sylph> i mean the languages are basically the same anyway... :/
2010-09-27T23:21:50  <jmcarthur> i don't understand how
2010-09-27T23:22:04  <Sylph> It boils down to strategy and being able to see how your strategy impact the bot performance....
2010-09-27T23:22:08  <jmcarthur> the language the visualizer is written in seems irrelevant to me
2010-09-27T23:22:12  <Sylph> hrm
2010-09-27T23:22:17  <Sylph> I don't know how they work in the interpreting
2010-09-27T23:22:20  * Janzert agrees
2010-09-27T23:22:22  <sigh> jmcarthur: why would the visualiser affect your language?
2010-09-27T23:22:24  <Sylph> maybe i need to read more on that
2010-09-27T23:22:29  <j3camero> dmj111:haha yeah that's where the most motivated contestants come from. The "fallen winners" who want to get back on top!
2010-09-27T23:22:38  <Sylph> I didn't know if the java visualizer is written to interpret C# bot or not
2010-09-27T23:22:44  <jmcarthur> sigh: that's what i'm asking
2010-09-27T23:22:44  <Zannick> the visualizer needs nothing but the playback output from the engine
2010-09-27T23:22:50  <Sylph> ah
2010-09-27T23:22:51  <jmcarthur> Sylph: they communicate via a simple text protocol
2010-09-27T23:22:53  <Zannick> the engine needs nothing but stdout from the bots
2010-09-27T23:22:53  <sigh> j3camero: it works the other way too, you can lose motivaton that way
2010-09-27T23:22:56  <Sylph> ah ok
2010-09-27T23:22:58  <Sylph> that's easy then
2010-09-27T23:23:02  <sigh> jmcarthur: ah, sorry misunderstood you
2010-09-27T23:23:04  <Sylph> Thanks
2010-09-27T23:23:09  <Sylph> I might go back to c#

2010-09-27T23:23:16  <Zannick> yes, they may be written in java, but the bots can be written in anything
2010-09-27T23:23:32  <Sylph> yeah, if they just need stdouts and stuff
2010-09-27T23:23:37  <Sylph> I didn't know how they were written
2010-09-27T23:23:39  <j3camero> There was a guy from Poland in the Tron contest who was on top for weeks, then he lost the top spot. His submission rate noticeably increased.
2010-09-27T23:23:47  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T23:23:59  <Sylph> I guess  reading the bot file and stdin/stdout it's pretty obvious now...
2010-09-27T23:24:03  <Sylph> >.>
2010-09-27T23:24:14  <Sylph> thankts
2010-09-27T23:24:22  <dmj111> tron is kind of a blur for me now...the last few weeks i messed everything up.
2010-09-27T23:24:24  <Zannick> np
2010-09-27T23:24:24  <Sylph> I barely started this yesterday, so I'm still not oriented
2010-09-27T23:24:31  <j3camero> Anyways, I have to stop neglecting my girlfriend at this point. I am glad people are enjoyin the contest! Talk soon.
2010-09-27T23:24:43  <dmj111> later.
2010-09-27T23:24:44  <sigh> bye!
2010-09-27T23:24:49  <Janzert> j3camero: if you still need people I'm still willing to help sort issues and such.
2010-09-27T23:24:59  <Janzert> oops, cya
2010-09-27T23:25:09  <sigh> j3camero: thanks for wrestling some secrets out of dmj :P
2010-09-27T23:25:12  <j3camero> Janzert: yes. Send me your gmail address in a PM. Imma add you.
2010-09-27T23:25:27  <Sylph> where :D
2010-09-27T23:25:38  * Sylph scrolls up in case the wrestling worked
2010-09-27T23:25:57  <Sylph> Ah I see
2010-09-27T23:26:13  <Sylph> yeah, future prediction was something I was considering to do on my rewrite. :/
2010-09-27T23:26:31  * Sylph keep that noted
2010-09-27T23:27:32  <Sylph> i noticed you only ever attack with a full fleet that's more than enough to take enemy planet, dmj
2010-09-27T23:27:44  <Sylph> considering nearby defenses and stuff
2010-09-27T23:29:11  <sigh> Sylph: he might just be doing that because it is easier, only one choice to make: do I have enough ships, yes or no?
2010-09-27T23:29:15  <Sylph> yeah

2010-09-27T23:29:48  <Sylph> it's better from the perspective that it keeps enemy guessing til last second
2010-09-27T23:29:57  <sigh> that too :)
2010-09-27T23:30:16  <Sylph> my bot would really misguess because of that.
2010-09-27T23:30:22  <sigh> if you send a steady stream, you give your opponent time to reorganise
2010-09-27T23:30:34  <Sylph> yeah, and its obvious to them what is going to get attacked, etc
2010-09-27T23:30:50  <Sylph> easy plucking planets from enemy hand
2010-09-27T23:30:54  <Sylph> right after they take it
2010-09-27T23:31:06  <sigh> yeah, it's the time lag, how quickly you act matters *a lot*

2010-09-27T23:34:50  <dmj111> One principle I was following was delaying until the last second.  but... there are also times when that is not the best plan.

2010-09-27T23:35:19  <sigh> dmj111: I do the same, and I also find that it is not *always* the best idea
2010-09-27T23:35:33  <sigh> sometimes it is better to deprive the opponent of ships, fast
2010-09-27T23:35:43  <sigh> but I don't know how to tell the difference :(
2010-09-27T23:36:01  <a1k0n> probably depends on the opponent
2010-09-27T23:36:26  <davidjliu> I mean, I personally think that a good strategy is to, when ahead and close enough to the opponent, send a constant stream of ships at all times
2010-09-27T23:36:30  <davidjliu> I don't actually do this though...
2010-09-27T23:36:32  <dmj111> yes.  one of my development deadends included code to wear the enemy down if I have the ships/growth rate.  didn't work the best though.
2010-09-27T23:36:46  <dmj111> davidjliu: i wonder about that too...
2010-09-27T23:37:19  <sigh> yeah, the problem I have is that introduces a lot more descisions... much more complex
2010-09-27T23:37:28  <dmj111> anyway, Obeleh's writeup in the forum covers most of what I do . ...

2010-09-27T23:38:10  <dmj111> sigh: I keep killing myself with complexity...
2010-09-27T23:38:14  <sigh> everytime I've tried sending a constant stream I end up starving my planets of ships

2010-09-27T23:38:46  <dmj111> davidjliu: thanks.  a few more matches with top 20 people, though, and I am sure I will be knocked down several pegs.  just waiting for it to happen ;)
2010-09-27T23:38:50  <sigh> sending ships in one go is much easier to decide
2010-09-27T23:38:51  <davidjliu> urg, and I've still played two games in the last five and a half hours...
2010-09-27T23:38:58  <davidjliu> ha, you're up 150 points on #2...
2010-09-27T23:39:17  *** keyne <keyne!~AndChat@211.234.144.38> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-27T23:39:19  <sigh> earlier he was over 200 :P
2010-09-27T23:39:23  <Sylph> thanks for the url, dmj
2010-09-27T23:39:37  <Sylph> that'll be helpful to help keep my rewrite in order
2010-09-27T23:40:12  <dmj111> that may be the luck of the draw.  I would like to see the matchups be even closer in ranking, but several of my losses were out of  the top 100, or even top 300 I think.
2010-09-27T23:40:24  <dmj111> Sylph: no problem.
2010-09-27T23:40:42  <Sylph> what do you do if you're on the losing end anyway? My idea is just to never be on the losing end... :/
2010-09-27T23:40:43  <sigh> dmj111: really? were thy legit losses, or just timeout?
2010-09-27T23:40:49  <davidjliu> defeinitely agree with the closer in ranking matchups, at least for the top 20-ish
2010-09-27T23:40:50  <Sylph> if i'm ever in the losing end, just optimize better >.>
2010-09-27T23:40:51  <dmj111> Sylph: ha!

2010-09-27T23:41:06  <dmj111> sigh: yep.  legit losses.
2010-09-27T23:41:14  <dmj111> let me look...
2010-09-27T23:42:03  <dmj111> huh, they have rolled out of my history.  now I understand my rating.
2010-09-27T23:42:08  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T23:42:12  <davidjliu> dmj111: I mean, I remember looking, and I feel that you generally expand at somewhat close to the rate the opponent expands
2010-09-27T23:42:24  <davidjliu> (very generally)
2010-09-27T23:42:28  <dmj111> this one is  ranked 780 now, and I cannot remember what he was ranked when we play.
2010-09-27T23:42:35  <dmj111> s/play/played/
2010-09-27T23:42:37  <dmj111> http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=7566
2010-09-27T23:43:00  <Sylph> seems simple strategy
2010-09-27T23:43:11  <dmj111> davidjliu: one weakness I have is being overly cautious with neutrals.
2010-09-27T23:43:19  <sigh> dmj111: the 780 is meaningless, he hasn't lost yet :P
2010-09-27T23:43:35  <Sylph> yeah
2010-09-27T23:43:35  <davidjliu> heh, except the thing you do to other people a lot is steal their neutrals...
2010-09-27T23:43:49  <Sylph> was probabl why he said don't know what rank he was before :
2010-09-27T23:43:51  <Sylph> mm
2010-09-27T23:43:57  <Sylph> lol david
2010-09-27T23:44:01  *** keyne <keyne!~AndChat@211.234.144.38> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2010-09-27T23:44:20  <dmj111> sigh: yeah.. I pushed it those losses out of my memory :)  I am not sure anymore...
2010-09-27T23:44:30  <sigh> :)
2010-09-27T23:44:43  <sigh> losses are the best to learn from, should keep them in your memory :P
2010-09-27T23:44:49  <dmj111> davidjliu: yeah.... i guess i am overly cautious because  of that.
2010-09-27T23:45:05  <sigh> I remember my losses to you and davidjliu well :D
2010-09-27T23:45:13  <davidjliu> heh
2010-09-27T23:45:19  <sigh> well, they were today, but still...
2010-09-27T23:45:51  <dmj111> sigh: true.  I have two or three known problems that I want to fix. I _think_ they are the causes of my losses... also, I do have them saved off.. but it does not include rankings.
2010-09-27T23:46:08  <sigh> yeah, fair enough
2010-09-27T23:47:28  <dmj111> Sylph: right now, my code is not aware of whether it is ahead or behind.
2010-09-27T23:47:34  * Sylph nods
2010-09-27T23:47:48  <sigh> dmj111: I glad I'm not the only one :)
2010-09-27T23:47:49  <Sylph> I'm trying to think of what language to use for my rewrite, mm
2010-09-27T23:48:01  <Sylph> C# would be nice, though shame no C# 4.0
2010-09-27T23:48:10  <davidjliu> dmj111: mine isn't aware either...
2010-09-27T23:48:19  <dmj111> i thought about F#, but python is so easy...
2010-09-27T23:48:23  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T23:48:34  <Sylph> ruby looks pretty too
2010-09-27T23:48:43  <Sylph> but last i checked pretty bad on speed
2010-09-27T23:49:00  <sigh> top 3 bots are python
2010-09-27T23:49:07  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T23:49:19  <Sylph> 5 top 10 bots are c++ though
2010-09-27T23:49:24  <dmj111> davidjliu, sigh : like we wondered about above, if you are ahead, maybe you can wear down the closest enemy with a constant stream.  hasn't worked for me here, but....
2010-09-27T23:50:07  <sigh> dmj111: I'm more concerned about strategies for when behind... beating the enemy when ahead is not as hard :D
2010-09-27T23:50:13  <davidjliu> dmj111, sigh: I think it worked against me here http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4784428
2010-09-27T23:50:16  * dmj111 laughs...
2010-09-27T23:50:16  <davidjliu> ha, yeah, true
2010-09-27T23:50:33  <Sylph> lol
2010-09-27T23:50:35  * Sylph checks
2010-09-27T23:51:26  <Sylph> hrm, why did you pick small planets, david
2010-09-27T23:51:31  <dmj111> yeah, sort of like that.  and longing seems to beat everyone, at least once.
2010-09-27T23:51:37  <dmj111> ok, at least me.
2010-09-27T23:51:56  <davidjliu> I think the small planets were more efficient
2010-09-27T23:52:07  * Sylph nods
2010-09-27T23:52:08  <davidjliu> and yeah, I always have a loss to extrapostrophe
2010-09-27T23:52:11  <sigh> I think position of planets is more important than growth
2010-09-27T23:52:20  <davidjliu> ha, yeah, I just consider distance to planets
2010-09-27T23:52:25  <sigh> davidjliu: same
2010-09-27T23:52:26  <Sylph> 20 units vs 47 units, and you get 2 vs 3 growth or something ?
2010-09-27T23:52:45  <dmj111> and before I forget... about the playing closer rankings... things are much better than they were most of the tron competition, so I will be content if they aren't changed.
2010-09-27T23:52:50  <Sylph> yeah, planet size and position matters a lot
2010-09-27T23:53:07  <Sylph> i mean unit on the planet
2010-09-27T23:53:09  <dmj111> also lost to extrapostrophe... maybe multiple times.
2010-09-27T23:53:27  <davidjliu> yeah...
2010-09-27T23:54:58  <dmj111> jmcarthur: i just realized you were the one from defense... hyour nick and j3camero looked the same in my small font.
2010-09-27T23:55:15  <davidjliu> I've also been seeing the problem that a lot of games have only showed up on one of the two profiles that played the game
2010-09-27T23:55:17  <dmj111> smarter than me if you got out in two years.
2010-09-27T23:55:34  <dmj111> davidjliu: i think that is because of a resubmit.
2010-09-27T23:55:50  <dmj111> if you want a game, make sure to save it off...
2010-09-27T23:56:27  <davidjliu> I mean consider http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=7935's latest game against Luksian, which is after Luksian resubmitted, but not on his profile
2010-09-27T23:57:19  <davidjliu> ha, oops, the 's got caught in the link...

2010-09-27T23:58:04  <davidjliu> it happens quite a bit, I think
2010-09-27T23:58:10  <sigh> davidjliu: we both dropped a place :P
