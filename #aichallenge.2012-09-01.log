2012-09-01T10:42:42  <antimatroidl1> it's a horrible mess but
2012-09-01T10:44:35  <antimatroidl1> mcstar: http://pastebin.com/Ma8Vwt98 without any cleaning
2012-09-01T10:44:37  <antimatroidl1> so yeah, gross
2012-09-01T10:44:45  <antimatroidl1> you will laugh at how over done that is :D
2012-09-01T10:44:50  <mcstar> haha
2012-09-01T10:45:03  <mcstar> some laugh in advance
2012-09-01T10:45:31  <antimatroidl1> cbf doing more tonight
2012-09-01T10:46:21  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: http://sprunge.us/JPib?python
2012-09-01T10:46:35  <mcstar> to keep you busy while im reading your code
2012-09-01T10:46:51  <antimatroidl1> the fuck is that?
2012-09-01T10:48:11  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: you showed my what you were writing, i showed what i was....
2012-09-01T10:48:14  <antimatroidl1> i can speed up some of what i've done too
2012-09-01T10:48:23  <antimatroidl1> cause i'm going to use it to generate information for me yet
2012-09-01T10:48:35  <antimatroidl1> i doubt it'll really matter though
2012-09-01T10:49:24  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: why do you write out empty constructors?
2012-09-01T10:49:37  <antimatroidl1> cause i'm that guy
2012-09-01T10:49:45  <mcstar> no, its bad
2012-09-01T10:49:48  <antimatroidl1> it's needed isn't it?
2012-09-01T10:49:52  <antimatroidl1> if there's other constructors
2012-09-01T10:49:56  <mcstar> write out the signature, and dont impolement it
2012-09-01T10:50:01  <antimatroidl1> meh :P
2012-09-01T10:50:06  <mcstar> so that you know you cant copy it accidentally
2012-09-01T10:50:14  <mcstar> or just leave it out entirely
2012-09-01T10:50:36  <antimatroidl1> i was planning to delete it if possible after
2012-09-01T10:50:45  <antimatroidl1> i find it easier to put it in then remove it than vice versa
2012-09-01T10:50:58  <antimatroidl1> just cause i'm terrible at programming :P
2012-09-01T10:51:24  <thestinger> mcstar: there are default copy/assignment methods made though
2012-09-01T10:51:40  <thestinger> unless you define a move constructor or delete them
2012-09-01T10:51:46  <mcstar> thats why i said, write the signature, but dont implement it
2012-09-01T10:51:49  <thestinger> foo(const other &) = delete;
2012-09-01T10:51:50  <mcstar> so there wont be any
2012-09-01T10:51:57  <thestinger> mcstar: deleting it is better
2012-09-01T10:51:59  <thestinger> gives a sane error
2012-09-01T10:52:24  <thestinger> but really fuck C++ :P
2012-09-01T10:52:28  <ronchaine> :(
2012-09-01T10:52:37  <thestinger> the effort you have to go through to make that crap exception safe...
2012-09-01T10:52:45  <antimatroidl1> i don't :P
2012-09-01T10:52:56  <mcstar> (*it).first == it->first
2012-09-01T10:52:59  <antimatroidl1> exceptions are for people who get things wrong
2012-09-01T10:53:05  <antimatroidl1> i know
2012-09-01T10:53:05  <thestinger> antimatroidl1: you use exceptions
2012-09-01T10:53:11  <antimatroidl1> i couldn't be bothered changing
2012-09-01T10:53:12  <thestinger> you use standard library containers
2012-09-01T10:53:21  <thestinger> they can throw
2012-09-01T10:53:35  <mcstar> this doesnt matter here
2012-09-01T10:53:38  <thestinger> ofc
2012-09-01T10:53:49  <mcstar> the problem with c++ in the example is that its way too verbose
2012-09-01T10:53:53  <thestinger> but if it's a quick bit of code, why use C++? :P
2012-09-01T10:54:03  <antimatroidl1> cause for me c++ is the fastest
2012-09-01T10:54:08  <antimatroidl1> lack of knowing anything else
2012-09-01T10:54:14  <mcstar> for(std::set<std::pair<int, int> >::iterator it=diagram2.nodes[0][c].neighbours.begin(); it!=diagram2.nodes[0][c].neighbours.end(); it++)
2012-09-01T10:54:17  <mcstar> lol ^^
2012-09-01T10:54:26  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: heard of auto and typedef?
2012-09-01T10:54:29  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-01T10:54:37  <antimatroidl1> remember i'm using really old gcc :P
2012-09-01T10:54:42  <thestinger> antimatroidl1: why?
2012-09-01T10:54:43  <ronchaine> for(auto it : diagram2)
2012-09-01T10:54:46  <mcstar> ok, then typedef
2012-09-01T10:54:47  <antimatroidl1> cause i'm retarded
2012-09-01T10:54:53  <thestinger> antimatroidl1: use a modern gcc/clang then
2012-09-01T10:54:54  <antimatroidl1> stuck on osx till monday at least
2012-09-01T10:54:58  <thestinger> antimatroidl1: use clang
2012-09-01T10:55:10  <thestinger> better errors/warnings, faster compile times
2012-09-01T10:55:11  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: if i had to use such long types, i did it with typdefs, it really makes it better
2012-09-01T10:55:19  <antimatroidl1> meh
2012-09-01T10:55:31  <antimatroidl1> once i get back onto ubuntu i'll make it nicer
2012-09-01T10:55:39  <antimatroidl1> like i said, i just got it working from hacking it together :P
2012-09-01T10:55:41  <thestinger> mcstar: btw I fixed my broke scope thing :P

2012-09-01T10:55:56  <mcstar> what was that? remind me
2012-09-01T10:56:46  <thestinger> mcstar: the little raii/lambda thing I was using
2012-09-01T10:56:50  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: osx has python by default, you could use it maybe
2012-09-01T10:56:51  <thestinger> turned out it was buggy
2012-09-01T10:56:53  <thestinger> had to fix it
2012-09-01T10:57:06  <mcstar> oh? in what way was it broken?
2012-09-01T10:57:13  <thestinger> it relied on the copy being eliminated
2012-09-01T10:57:19  <thestinger> from make_scope_guard
2012-09-01T10:57:20  <mcstar> the lambda did run, didnt it?
2012-09-01T10:57:23  <thestinger> mcstar: yes
2012-09-01T10:57:36  <thestinger> mcstar: well with C++11 it was guaranteed to work
2012-09-01T10:57:38  <antimatroidl1> mcstar: I don't know python well enough
2012-09-01T10:57:39  <mcstar> what copy?
2012-09-01T10:57:51  <thestinger> mcstar: C++ guarantees the return value optimization
2012-09-01T10:57:56  <thestinger> C++11 *
2012-09-01T10:58:00  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-01T10:58:10  <thestinger> but I used it in old code with -O0 and it broke :)
2012-09-01T10:58:19  <mcstar> oh
2012-09-01T10:58:39  <thestinger> calls the lambda twice
2012-09-01T10:58:40  <mcstar> i see, the lambda run when you made the guard?
2012-09-01T10:58:49  <mcstar> (returned it)
2012-09-01T10:59:13  <thestinger> mcstar: yeah
2012-09-01T10:59:48  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: i want a quick break from what ive been doing
2012-09-01T10:59:51  <thestinger> https://gist.github.com/3576108 saner, and it needs .dismiss() anyway
2012-09-01T10:59:59  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: what is the algorithm? wo going through the code
2012-09-01T11:00:12  <thestinger> somehow compiles to the same code
2012-09-01T11:00:13  <antimatroidl1> i have a hockey final in just over 10 hours
2012-09-01T11:00:18  <antimatroidl1> (field)
2012-09-01T11:00:28  <thestinger> gcc is smart enough to avoid actually using a struct
2012-09-01T11:00:36  <antimatroidl1> only prelim
2012-09-01T11:02:56  <thestinger> mcstar: actually, I think it was still buggy before
2012-09-01T11:03:01  <thestinger> even with guaranteed RVO
2012-09-01T11:03:16  <thestinger> because after being moved, the old object still has the destructor called
2012-09-01T11:03:32  <thestinger> but gcc wasn't using the default move constructor at all, it just completely removes the existence of the struct
2012-09-01T11:04:50  <mcstar> well, you could make a class, that takes a void(*)(void) lambda, i think
2012-09-01T11:05:07  <mcstar> and you wouldnt return it or anything
2012-09-01T11:05:34  <mcstar> just capture the resource..
2012-09-01T11:06:32  <thestinger> well that's how you would use this
2012-09-01T11:06:41  <thestinger> auto stmt_guard = make_scope_guard([stmt] { sqlite3_finalize(stmt); } );
2012-09-01T11:07:40  <mcstar> if stmt is a pointer
2012-09-01T11:07:47  <thestinger> yes
2012-09-01T11:07:51  <mcstar> but otherwise id capture it with a reference
2012-09-01T11:08:02  <thestinger> auto conn_guard = make_scope_guard([&conn] { sqlite3_close(conn); }); from the same thing
2012-09-01T11:08:12  <mcstar> let me find your code
2012-09-01T11:08:14  <thestinger> conn is a ptr but sqlite sets it (rather than returning it)
2012-09-01T11:10:26  <thestinger> dismiss is nice for locks though
2012-09-01T11:10:28  <mcstar> thestinger: ok, i get it, why do you need the template parameter?
2012-09-01T11:10:38  <mcstar> i dont think you do
2012-09-01T11:10:42  <thestinger> mcstar: because that's the best way to pass a lambda
2012-09-01T11:10:45  <thestinger> each has their own type
2012-09-01T11:10:51  <thestinger> passing as std::function will do a heap allocation
2012-09-01T11:10:56  <thestinger> pretty much guaranteed
2012-09-01T11:11:08  <mcstar> why do you care?
2012-09-01T11:11:17  <thestinger> because heap allocations are really, really slow
2012-09-01T11:11:29  <thestinger> and I want to be able to use this all over (not just for resources)
2012-09-01T11:11:47  <mcstar> but i think id be simpler if you didnt use a template
2012-09-01T11:11:59  <mcstar> it'd*
2012-09-01T11:12:31  <thestinger> why?
2012-09-01T11:12:59  <thestinger> it would just be std::function<void()>

2012-09-01T11:38:08  <thestinger> not like that
2012-09-01T11:38:25  <thestinger> actually yes, total brain fuckup there
2012-09-01T11:38:32  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-01T11:38:37  <mcstar> emacs does that with anything
2012-09-01T11:38:46  <thestinger> have to yell at vim to do it :(
2012-09-01T11:38:53  <mcstar> and in c++  mode, tab always indent the right way
2012-09-01T11:39:17  <mcstar> if you select a block, and press tab, it indents the whole thing
2012-09-01T11:39:33  <thestinger> yes

2012-09-01T11:40:02  <mcstar> yeah, but i mentioned, because you use the tab again

2012-09-01T11:40:34  <thestinger> completion, snippets, inserting tabs
2012-09-01T11:40:49  <thestinger> if it did another it would probably break
2012-09-01T11:41:02  <mcstar> we use ctrl meta super alt compose for custom stuff
2012-09-01T11:41:11  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-01T11:41:41  <mcstar> just kidding, anyway, with emacs, we dont rebind simple keys liek tab

2012-09-01T11:42:00  <thestinger> custom stuff is perfectly fine implemented as commands
2012-09-01T11:42:15  <thestinger> but I'm a creature of habit and I want tab to do completion, not ^X^O
2012-09-01T11:42:30  <thestinger> and I don't always want to think "do I want file completion, omni completion or a snippet?"
