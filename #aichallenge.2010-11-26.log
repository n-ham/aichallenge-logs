2010-11-26T00:12:55  <sanddbox> thanks
2010-11-26T00:13:06  <sanddbox> i hate the jar file because it makes the entire process so complicated
2010-11-26T00:13:45  <virdo> sanddbox: how will it be easier without it?
2010-11-26T00:14:05  <sanddbox> i can make it part of my program
2010-11-26T00:14:48  <Zannick> you're going to put the engine in your bot?
2010-11-26T00:14:50  <virdo> I guess if you want/need to do that, source will be better ;) -- what do you plan on doing?
2010-11-26T00:14:56  *** aizu <aizu!~jaiz@184.53.138.6> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-26T00:15:18  <sanddbox> Zannick, not exactly
2010-11-26T00:15:47  <sanddbox> the engine will be in the main file which will run it with my bot against a test bot automatically
2010-11-26T00:16:18  <Zannick> i see
2010-11-26T00:16:18  <virdo> Why complicate it though? Performance benefits?
2010-11-26T00:16:35  <sanddbox> mostly time benefits
2010-11-26T00:16:44  <Zannick> i've written similar convenience scripts
2010-11-26T00:16:45  <sanddbox> not performance with the program itself
2010-11-26T00:16:48  <sanddbox> but every time i make a change
2010-11-26T00:16:57  <Zannick> but they use the actual server backend (which is python)
2010-11-26T00:17:13  <sanddbox> (i'm coding in java)
2010-11-26T00:17:24  <sanddbox> since my IDE requires the package statements at the beginning
2010-11-26T00:17:47  <virdo> What package statements?
2010-11-26T00:17:48  <sanddbox> but if i include the package statements when i run it with the jars
2010-11-26T00:17:53  <sanddbox> it doesn't work

2010-11-26T00:19:07  <virdo> sanddbox: but what does that have to do with the engine?
2010-11-26T00:19:21  <virdo> engine, your bot, adn test bot (and replay viewer) can all be separate applications.

2010-11-26T00:19:46  <sanddbox> yeah, but it makes the process of testing my bots frustrating
2010-11-26T00:19:47  <Zannick> how are you compiling? the server will compile everything into classes, then put them all in a jar file
2010-11-26T00:19:53  <sanddbox> plus if i integrate the engine
2010-11-26T00:19:57  <Zannick> you can probably do the same and run the jar
2010-11-26T00:20:03  <sanddbox> then i can just do a one-click run
2010-11-26T00:20:12  <sanddbox> instead of having to run it with command prompt
2010-11-26T00:20:48  <virdo> sanddbox: simple batch file (if windows) will do the trick too...
2010-11-26T00:21:09  <sanddbox> that occured to me as well
2010-11-26T00:21:11  <virdo> if you deviate too far from the way the bot supposed to work normally, it may be tougher to later submit it and have it working on the contest server.
2010-11-26T00:21:26  <sanddbox> however
2010-11-26T00:22:00  <sanddbox> since i have to copypaste the contents of one file into another identical one minus the package statement
2010-11-26T00:22:11  <sanddbox> it would still waste a lot of time :/

2010-11-26T01:00:03  *** jshriver <jshriver!~jshriver@72.240.39.36> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-26T01:07:08  <virdo> sanddbox: I'm sorry, I'm not sure how you're breaking playgame.jar... Can you run your bot from the console? Just try java MyBot -- that should work... You later should be able to type in just "go" into it... later, possibly copy & paste a map1.txt contents, followed by go, to see your how your bot reacts.
2010-11-26T01:07:25  <virdo> I'm guessing currently your bot crashes somewhere, and you don't see the error on the screen?
2010-11-26T01:07:50  <sanddbox> here's the thing
2010-11-26T01:07:56  <bhasker>  hah my future ships calculation seems to be working
2010-11-26T01:07:56  <sanddbox> with package statement it works fine
2010-11-26T01:07:58  <sanddbox> er
2010-11-26T01:08:00  <sanddbox> without*
2010-11-26T01:08:05  <sanddbox> with it, it just hangs
2010-11-26T01:08:05  <bhasker> antimatroid around?
2010-11-26T01:08:20  <sanddbox> i've just decided to fuck packages but it makes the program a lot less pretty :(
2010-11-26T01:08:44  <virdo> Does it hang on a specific turn?
2010-11-26T01:08:54  <sanddbox> the turns don't even start
2010-11-26T01:08:59  <sanddbox> it's not my bot crashing
2010-11-26T01:09:21  <virdo> What do you mean it isn't? What other bot could be crashing?
2010-11-26T01:09:40  <sanddbox> okay, it's technically crashing
2010-11-26T01:09:48  <sanddbox> but not because of my code but because the jar doesn't support packages
2010-11-26T01:10:53  <virdo> sanddbox: but jar (playgame.jar) has nothing to do with your bot compiling... are you saying you cannot run javac MyBot.java ? (note, I don't do java much, so I could be off here myself :)
2010-11-26T01:11:09  <sanddbox> it compiles fine
2010-11-26T01:11:25  <virdo> alright, so now, run java MyBot (without playgame.jar, forget about it for now)
2010-11-26T01:11:40  <virdo> does that work? can you type "go" into it and press enter?
2010-11-26T01:11:50  <virdo> do you get "go" in response from your bot?
2010-11-26T01:12:32  <sanddbox> one sec
2010-11-26T01:12:43  <virdo> if you do, copy paste this into your bot next:
2010-11-26T01:12:46  <virdo> P 15 15 0 58 5
2010-11-26T01:12:46  <virdo> P 18.2935830488 5.78544965825 1 100 5

2010-11-26T01:12:56  <virdo> first 3 lines from map1.txt + go
2010-11-26T01:13:25  <sanddbox> java MyBot just hangs :/
2010-11-26T01:15:15  <virdo> :/ doesn't crash? doesn't accept any input?
2010-11-26T01:15:30  <virdo> and we haven't even touched playgame.jar
2010-11-26T01:15:35  <sanddbox> well
2010-11-26T01:15:41  <sanddbox> accepts input, but does nothing
2010-11-26T01:16:00  <virdo> ah, accepts input? that's a good start :)
2010-11-26T01:16:11  <virdo> does it reply with go?
2010-11-26T01:16:15  <sanddbox> nope
2010-11-26T01:16:54  <virdo> hmm, did you try pasting the 3 lines with "P ..." followed by "go"?
2010-11-26T01:17:08  <virdo> go being without quotes!

2010-11-26T01:19:52  <sanddbox> package support for java would prevent all this trouble :(
2010-11-26T01:21:06  <virdo> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=1140 according to this, they do support packages now even on the official server, no?
2010-11-26T01:22:28  <antimatroid1> deepblue's bot is doing very well to be at 143rg
2010-11-26T01:22:29  <sanddbox> it won't work locally, though
2010-11-26T01:22:37  <antimatroid1> given it crashes on any map with more than 23 planets
2010-11-26T01:24:53  <janzert> sanddbox: package support should be working on the server now, although I have yet to hear back from anyone that it actually is
2010-11-26T01:25:22  <janzert> Zannick put together the support for it yesterday
2010-11-26T01:26:12  <sanddbox> janzert: but how do i get it to work on my machine?
2010-11-26T01:26:49  <janzert> the bots are all executed directly, so however you execute java on your machine basically
2010-11-26T01:27:11  <janzert> on the server if I remember correctly java is executed as java -jar MyBot.jar
2010-11-26T01:27:36  <sanddbox> well here's my problem
2010-11-26T01:27:49  <sanddbox> when I do it in my IDE with packages
2010-11-26T01:27:53  <sanddbox> the program hangs
2010-11-26T01:28:02  <sanddbox> when i run it with the playgame/showgame
2010-11-26T01:28:13  <sanddbox> without packages, i get a noclassdef error
2010-11-26T01:28:55  <sanddbox> and if i copy the sauce without the package statement into different files and i don't run my bot as a jar, it works :/
2010-11-26T01:28:58  <janzert> make sure you're using the correct line to start it with playgame, it should be the same as if you start it directly from the command prompt
2010-11-26T01:29:12  <sanddbox> i am starting it directly from command prompt
2010-11-26T01:29:29  <janzert> and you can feed it data and get correct responses?
2010-11-26T01:30:02  <janzert> playgame communicates with the bot just like you typing input into it and watching the output
2010-11-26T01:31:02  <sanddbox> yes
2010-11-26T01:31:14  <sanddbox> i'm getting correct responses
2010-11-26T01:31:45  <sanddbox> hmm
2010-11-26T01:31:49  <janzert> then take that same command line and use it as the argument to playgame to start your bot with and it really should work
2010-11-26T01:31:55  <sanddbox> when i run it in my IDE i get correct responses, but in command line
2010-11-26T01:31:56  <sanddbox> i don't get any

2010-11-26T01:35:17  <janzert> I'm not really familiar with java but one thing is do you have the right magic java needs there to know that MyBot.java has the main code even though the jar is PWBot?
2010-11-26T01:36:01  <janzert> beyond that I really don't have any ideas, but getting it to work from the command line is the first step I suppose
2010-11-26T01:36:11  <sanddbox> the main code is actually in Main.java
2010-11-26T01:36:40  <virdo> sanddbox: did you start off with the starter kit?
2010-11-26T01:36:45  <sanddbox> yeah
2010-11-26T01:36:56  <janzert> ok, correct magic for that then :) But be warned that the server is going to require MyBot.java
2010-11-26T01:37:02  <virdo> find case '\n': and change it to \r
2010-11-26T01:37:09  <virdo> (for testing purposes)
2010-11-26T01:37:16  <virdo> I think I may have ran into same issue you ran into (Windows)
2010-11-26T01:37:22  <sanddbox> janzert: the main code _has_ to be in MyBot.java?
2010-11-26T01:37:35  <sanddbox> virdo, will do
2010-11-26T01:37:37  <sanddbox> lemme try it
2010-11-26T01:37:58  <janzert> yes, it looks for MyBot.java to even detect that the bot is written in java
2010-11-26T01:38:04  <virdo> the case is per character... and it seems \r\n is failing the "go" statement, since the line equals really "go\n"
2010-11-26T01:38:12  <sanddbox> virdo, i love you
2010-11-26T01:38:19  <janzert> then compiles it based on that containing the main function

2010-11-26T01:46:29  <sanddbox> with both cases
2010-11-26T01:46:36  <virdo> you sure this is valid: "case '\r' | '\n':" ?
2010-11-26T01:46:38  <sanddbox> the command prompt doesn't return the "go"
2010-11-26T01:46:44  <sanddbox> virdo, it wasn't
2010-11-26T01:46:50  <sanddbox> it should have been || and you can't compare it like that
2010-11-26T01:46:52  <sanddbox> but i alraedy fixed it
2010-11-26T01:46:54  <sanddbox> already*

2010-11-26T01:48:05  <sanddbox> i changed the  message += line + "\n"; to \r for the \r case
2010-11-26T01:48:10  <sanddbox> and now it works in the ide and command prompt
2010-11-26T01:48:17  <sanddbox> but still no luck with actually running it with playgame/showgame
2010-11-26T01:48:49  <virdo> for the \r case, you should probably do \r\n, I'm guessing
2010-11-26T01:49:26  <sanddbox> no change
2010-11-26T01:49:58  <sanddbox> :/:/:/
2010-11-26T01:50:04  <burny> when I upload new code, does it change my position in the que atall?
2010-11-26T01:50:48  <janzert> burny: yes
2010-11-26T01:50:55  <virdo> sanddbox: could you run randombot and see if it has the same problem? (does it reply?)
2010-11-26T01:51:03  <burny> in what way jan?
2010-11-26T01:51:17  <sanddbox> virdo, you mean random bot vs random bot?
2010-11-26T01:51:22  <virdo> sure
2010-11-26T01:51:26  <janzert> you get an immediate game, please don't exploit this :}
2010-11-26T01:51:51  <burny> also removes you from que?
2010-11-26T01:51:57  <sanddbox> virdo, works
2010-11-26T01:52:00  <burny> or if you're almost ready, you get 2 games?
2010-11-26T01:52:02  <sanddbox> burny, queue* (sorry)
2010-11-26T01:52:03  <janzert> basically bumps you to the head of it
2010-11-26T01:52:12  <janzert> burny: no
2010-11-26T01:52:26  <burny> k
2010-11-26T01:52:38  <sanddbox> hmm
2010-11-26T01:52:45  <burny> that's cool for the way I've been working then
2010-11-26T01:52:49  <sanddbox> virdo, does the playgame/showgame require my main code be in MyBot.java ?

2010-11-26T01:53:01  <burny> making little changes, and analyzing game to see if it's working right, then re-submit
2010-11-26T01:53:12  <janzert> the "queue" isn't an actual realized queue it's just the bot with the least recent game is scheduled next and new submissions have never played
2010-11-26T01:53:37  <burny> easy way to prevent abuse, is to make people who's code compiles to the same binary, not get bumped
2010-11-26T01:53:51  <virdo> sanddbox: playgame/showgame doesn't require any of that really -- it only needs to send/receive standard input/output
2010-11-26T01:53:56  <sanddbox> burny, still possible to make tiny changes though
2010-11-26T01:54:10  <janzert> burny: or consider new submissions to just have played whenever the last submission did
2010-11-26T01:54:44  <janzert> but overall it has been seen as good to give new submissions a game as soon as possible even though it can be exploited
2010-11-26T01:54:49  <burny> I think that if people are actively watching the games, and making changes, and submiting.. it's very good that they get extra games
2010-11-26T01:55:07  <janzert> I suppose whenever it becomes a big problem that view by the community will change
2010-11-26T01:55:11  <sanddbox> virdo, how is it possible that it works in both command prompt/my ide and the jar says it crashes?
2010-11-26T01:55:39  <virdo> ideally, for next competition, the contest organizers will be providing us with binary tougher bots... this way you can do most tests locally.
2010-11-26T01:55:57  <sanddbox> i wish i'd found out about this earlier :/
2010-11-26T01:56:09  <virdo> sanddbox: I have a big feeling it has to do with the '\n' '\r'
2010-11-26T01:56:12  <janzert> sanddbox: I don't remember for sure but I think it says it crashes if it doesn't get a go response
2010-11-26T01:56:39  <Zannick> i think it says it times out if it doesn't get a go response
2010-11-26T01:56:48  <Zannick> crashes is the pipe breaks or something
2010-11-26T01:56:50  <janzert> other people here could probably tell you that better though since I haven't used playgame.jar hardly at all
2010-11-26T01:56:57  <janzert> Zannick: ahh, ok
2010-11-26T01:57:06  <Zannick> i think
2010-11-26T01:57:13  <Zannick> i might be thinking of the python engine, though
2010-11-26T01:57:29  <sanddbox> | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-11-26T01:57:35  <sanddbox> what could be wrong with that :(((((((((((((
2010-11-26T01:57:43  <virdo> get rid of that for now
2010-11-26T01:57:57  <virdo> you should see tons of output without it ;)
2010-11-26T01:58:10  <sanddbox> nope, still crashes
2010-11-26T01:58:11  <virdo> but at least you should see something.
2010-11-26T01:58:20  <virdo> yeah, that means it's not showgame related :(
2010-11-26T01:58:22  <sanddbox> besides, even if it was the pipe wouldn't i have seen the turns first?
2010-11-26T01:58:37  <Zannick> yes, the showgame is entirely after the game is played
2010-11-26T01:58:45  <sanddbox> maybe i should just go back to my ugly way of doing it before
2010-11-26T01:59:03  <sanddbox> it wastes a minute every time i want to run it, but at least it works

2010-11-26T02:01:43  <sanddbox> not sure yet
2010-11-26T02:01:43  <virdo> upgrade playgame to 1.2 :P
2010-11-26T02:01:47  <sanddbox> updating now
2010-11-26T02:01:53  <sanddbox> if it works infants will be shot

2010-11-26T04:59:48  <mega1> For experimenting it's proxybot for strength tests over a lot of maps I create binaries.

2010-11-26T05:00:55  <mega1> I have just realized why generating sniping moves made no difference so far.
2010-11-26T05:01:16  <mega1> Because I tested against my own bot and that doesn't make easily snipable moves.

2010-11-26T05:12:58  <antimatroid> it'll make defensive moves that it can at the start and redistribution ones at the end, then the game tree can only check like 3-4 turns if that
2010-11-26T05:13:27  <antimatroid> mega1: i don't have any special code for "sniping", i just take their planets as early as possible, hence i will consider taking their planet just after them
2010-11-26T05:13:33  <antimatroid> i wont take a planet when they do
2010-11-26T05:13:40  <antimatroid> not a neutral one*
2010-11-26T05:14:26  <mega1> taking enemy planets as early as possible is fine
2010-11-26T05:14:44  <antimatroid> then shouldn't sniping just be covered by that?
2010-11-26T05:15:33  <mega1> if an enemy fleet is going to take a neutral my current bot only tries to counter by taking the neutral as early as possible
2010-11-26T05:16:11  <mega1> if that's earlier than the turn the enemy takes it then it may be suboptimal
2010-11-26T05:16:16  <antimatroid> oh, i wont take a neutral that is to be claimed in the future
2010-11-26T05:16:22  <antimatroid> it's not optimal, but it's a decent hack
2010-11-26T05:17:03  <mega1> my bot takes it if it's better than leaving it alone
2010-11-26T05:17:22  <mega1> but now it also tries to actively snipe it even if it could take it before the enemy
2010-11-26T05:17:57  <antimatroid> yeah, that's way too expensive for me to calculate
2010-11-26T05:18:05  <antimatroid> i'm trying to find things i don't actually need now
2010-11-26T05:19:18  <antimatroid> smiley worries me

2010-11-26T05:21:32  <antimatroid> it's most probably timeouts

2010-11-26T05:25:22  <aerique> ebel: there should be an error message in red on the right below the map
2010-11-26T05:26:52  <aerique> ebel: if it isn't a timeout you can get the game state from the HTML, convert it using this tool: parse_game_state_url.py and feed it back to your bot
2010-11-26T05:27:12  <aerique> ebel: sorry, i meant to link to this: http://ai-contest.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=628
2010-11-26T05:28:14  <ebel> hmm it says "ebelular crashed / did not start / timeout.", which i assume is a big with my (python) code
2010-11-26T05:28:49  <aerique> ebel: yeah, that's one of the more confusing error message :-|
2010-11-26T05:29:07  <ebel> on my machine i can see the (python) stacktrace with where the error is. I wonder if it's possible to get that from the website?
2010-11-26T05:29:12  <aerique> ebel: can you link the game?

2010-11-26T12:37:16  <Mistmanov> I've quit working on the contest in order to focus on my internship report that was due 10 months ago (eh...)
2010-11-26T12:37:31  <Error323> wow
2010-11-26T12:37:46  <Mistmanov> so the version that's currently uploaded is fmy final
2010-11-26T12:37:49  <Error323> well i admit i had a few weeks delay because of the contest
2010-11-26T12:37:49  <Mistmanov> you seem to be beating it :p
2010-11-26T12:38:27  <Mistmanov> yeah I had 10 months delay due to a 3 month contest -_-
2010-11-26T12:38:30  <Error323> well with all the resubmissions and little games played going on its hard to conclude that
2010-11-26T12:38:34  <Error323> lol
2010-11-26T12:39:21  <Error323> when will you be finished? or is that the wrong questino
2010-11-26T12:39:31  <Mistmanov> yeah that's a bad question :p
2010-11-26T12:39:45  <Error323> ;)
2010-11-26T12:40:42  <Error323> I still have to write like 80% and gather results for my thesis
2010-11-26T12:40:46  <Mistmanov> the NOS was claiming that the new plans for tuitition etc would mean that students who have more than 1 year delay are going to have to pay an extra 3000 per year, and not get an OV card
2010-11-26T12:40:57  <Mistmanov> and worst of all: they're going to apply it retroactively
2010-11-26T12:41:05  <Error323> WHAT?
2010-11-26T12:41:07  <Mistmanov> and next year is my seventh
2010-11-26T12:41:14  <Mistmanov> so I'm gonna have to finish this year or I'm fucked :p
2010-11-26T12:41:33  <Mistmanov> (NOS could be wrong but eh..)\
2010-11-26T12:42:23  <Error323> what do you mean by retroactively, like you have to pay the 3K for previous delayed years aswell?
2010-11-26T12:42:36  <Mistmanov> no like current students will already be affected
2010-11-26T12:42:45  <Mistmanov> normally these kind of thigns will only apply for new students
2010-11-26T12:42:51  <Error323> ah
2010-11-26T12:43:12  <Mistmanov> but like a student who started 6 years ago with the idea of "oh I can do two studies at the same time and take a bit longer since it won't cost much" is going to be screwed
2010-11-26T12:43:25  <Error323> will it be next study year or calendar year?
2010-11-26T12:43:29  <Mistmanov> study
2010-11-26T12:43:36  <Error323> ohhh good
2010-11-26T12:43:51  <Error323> you surely are done then rgiht?
2010-11-26T12:44:06  <Mistmanov> well I still have another internship to go
2010-11-26T12:44:15  <Mistmanov> so can't afford any delays there
2010-11-26T12:44:23  <Error323> o_O
2010-11-26T12:44:32  <Error323> 2 internships in a scientific master/
2010-11-26T12:44:36  <Mistmanov> yeah?
2010-11-26T12:44:43  <Error323> or is this bachelor?
2010-11-26T12:44:45  <Mistmanov> master
2010-11-26T12:44:53  <Error323> mmm
2010-11-26T12:44:55  <Mistmanov> 1 of 7 months and 1 of 5
2010-11-26T12:44:57  <Error323> never heard of that
2010-11-26T12:45:04  <Mistmanov> and 2 months literature study
2010-11-26T12:45:27  <Mistmanov> probably because my field is a bit broader
2010-11-26T12:45:34  <Error323> so you're kinda glad the contest is over :P
2010-11-26T12:45:35  <Mistmanov> lots of different things that you can do an intership in
2010-11-26T12:45:37  <Error323> well so am I tbh
2010-11-26T12:45:44  <Error323> I see
2010-11-26T12:45:49  <Mistmanov> yeah it removes some temptation
2010-11-26T12:46:03  <Error323> well AI is also extremely broad
2010-11-26T12:46:11  <Error323> but we only have 1 thesis
2010-11-26T12:46:18  <Error323> and 0 or 1 internship
2010-11-26T12:46:21  <Mistmanov> true, but it's still always "sit behind a computer programming" right? :p
2010-11-26T12:46:23  <Error323> depending on where you work
2010-11-26T12:46:51  <Mistmanov> with us you can be in a hospital measuring patients, be in a biology lab pipetting all day, be in a physics lab playing with lasers..
2010-11-26T12:47:06  <Error323> no, there is philosophy, psychology, math, robotics

2010-11-26T12:48:30  <Error323> but seriously
2010-11-26T12:49:03  <Error323> how can they put such deadlines on scientific studies where a thesis being done in 6/9 months is _very_ dependent on the subject
2010-11-26T12:49:15  <Error323> and not the slacking of the student persee
2010-11-26T12:49:18  <Error323> it sux
2010-11-26T12:49:50  <Mistmanov> yeah it's a bit random whether you get good results
2010-11-26T12:49:54  <Mistmanov> my results completely suck
2010-11-26T12:49:59  <Mistmanov> but still have to write a report on it
2010-11-26T12:50:14  <Error323> I'd be delaying aswell then ye :/
2010-11-26T12:50:16  <Mistmanov> lot harder than when you get nice results and can show all the pretty picutres
2010-11-26T12:50:22  <Error323> indeed.
2010-11-26T12:50:34  <Error323> frustrating is the word :P
2010-11-26T12:50:47  <Mistmanov> my internship was basically 7 months of making slight modifcations on a 1 week experiment
2010-11-26T12:51:01  <Mistmanov> 28 variations later, none of them worked
2010-11-26T12:51:02  <Mistmanov> yay
2010-11-26T12:51:05  <Error323> heh wow
2010-11-26T12:51:29  <Error323> we kunnen trouwens netzogoed nederlands praten
2010-11-26T12:51:42  <Error323> kben nu al 48e :S kut
2010-11-26T12:51:51  <Mistmanov> that would be even more a-social than hijacking this chatbox with completely off-topic material :p
2010-11-26T12:52:22  <Error323> hah, well atm we are the only ones active it seems
2010-11-26T12:52:34  <Mistmanov> there might be people who read the logs :o
2010-11-26T12:52:46  <Mistmanov> I scan them every day for some interesting tidbits
2010-11-26T12:52:53  <Error323> really
2010-11-26T12:53:06  <Mistmanov> yeah, I figure it's the same as reading forums
2010-11-26T12:53:14  <Mistmanov> and there's more material here than in the forum =)
2010-11-26T12:53:33  <Error323> well true but also much more noise
2010-11-26T12:53:39  <Error323> like we are creating now xD
2010-11-26T12:53:43  <Mistmanov> ^^
2010-11-26T12:53:47  <Mistmanov> that's why this is asocial :p
2010-11-26T12:53:54  <Mistmanov> is that an english word btw?
2010-11-26T12:53:54  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-26T12:53:59  <Mistmanov> anti-social or something might be better
2010-11-26T12:54:09  <Error323> non-social
2010-11-26T12:54:10  <Error323> i dunno
2010-11-26T12:54:15  <Error323> but i understand :P
2010-11-26T12:54:41  <Error323> well time for my final adjustment
2010-11-26T12:54:45  <Error323> which hopefully will pay of
2010-11-26T12:54:50  <Mistmanov> good luck =)

2010-11-26T12:58:02  <Mistmanov> my old bot
2010-11-26T12:58:10  <Mistmanov> was on a different account
2010-11-26T12:58:14  <Mistmanov> that I lost acces to :p
2010-11-26T12:58:21  <Mistmanov> so it was playing for months before it was disabled
2010-11-26T12:58:28  <Mistmanov> it was something like 400th last week
2010-11-26T12:58:31  <Error323> hehe
2010-11-26T12:58:39  <Mistmanov> and that was a bot that I made in 2 days
2010-11-26T12:59:04  <Mistmanov> so either I'm just brilliant (;)), or everyone below 400 hasn't really been trying :p
2010-11-26T12:59:23  <Mistmanov> or has been trying something really fancy that failed
2010-11-26T12:59:27  <Mistmanov> (possibility ofcourse)
2010-11-26T12:59:28  <Error323> no there is another explanation
2010-11-26T12:59:49  <Error323> after so many months of play the rating is so stable that it drops extremely slow

2010-11-26T13:03:12  <Error323> isn't that important?
2010-11-26T13:03:38  <davidjliu> "Remove time limit on games used in rankings from query in readgames.py"
2010-11-26T13:03:55  <Mistmanov> I think they currently remove old games because a lot of the old games will be against old versions, so they don't give any info
2010-11-26T13:04:07  <Error323> ohh remove timelimit
2010-11-26T13:04:13  <Error323> that makes sense yes
2010-11-26T13:04:14  <Mistmanov> once we can't submit new versions, it doesn't matter how old a game is

2010-11-26T13:38:27  <antimatroid> :)
2010-11-26T13:38:38  <medrimonia> gosh... the ranking is so amazing
2010-11-26T13:38:38  <Error323> mega1: hehe
2010-11-26T13:38:52  <Error323> medrimonia: why
2010-11-26T13:38:57  <antimatroid> iouris ranking took a real blow from that draw
2010-11-26T13:38:59  <medrimonia> without updating, I was in top 10, I went down to 26
2010-11-26T13:39:14  <medrimonia> And then... I come back to tenth place
2010-11-26T13:39:15  <antimatroid> yeah, the rankings are unstable as fuck atm
2010-11-26T13:40:43  <Migi32> interesting that one of _iouri_'s 2 losses was to a person who is now rank #60
2010-11-26T13:41:22  <medrimonia> I'm really doubting to resubmit a new bot before the deadline
2010-11-26T13:42:10  <medrimonia> I've had some little "improves" since, but I fear that it won't be as good
2010-11-26T13:42:54  <Error323> yeah you need to be extremely sure
2010-11-26T13:43:07  <Error323> only when the improvements make actual sense
2010-11-26T13:43:54  <medrimonia> I've a little improve like "if it's more than ten turns that I'm loosing, then expand even if it's risky" (sorry for the bad english)

2010-11-26T13:45:11  *** Palmik <Palmik!~Palmik@palmikpc.sks6.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-26T13:45:32  <medrimonia> I just wanted to add some things like: if it's quite sure that I'll be loosing, then at least, try something
2010-11-26T13:46:04  <Error323> well i tried it by computing the derivative
2010-11-26T13:46:13  <Error323> or rate of score decreasing
2010-11-26T13:46:38  <medrimonia> But the biggest problem is how to define the quite sure, because if it's too soon, you're risking to loose some game that you would have win
2010-11-26T13:46:42  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-26T13:46:48  <Error323> that was the problem =)
2010-11-26T13:46:49  <medrimonia> and if it's too late, it's useless...
2010-11-26T13:47:54  <medrimonia> That's why this kind of modification is requiring more times to be sure of what you do
2010-11-26T13:48:59  <Error323> ye...
2010-11-26T13:50:59  <Mistmanov> I've got a "start doing stuff when you lose" algorithm, and it's never made me win, but at least it gives pretty pictures..
2010-11-26T13:51:27  <Mistmanov> like when a fleet of 2000 is attacking your planet of 1500, just flee and start rampaging around
2010-11-26T13:51:37  <Mistmanov> you will still lose, but don't go down without a fight =)
2010-11-26T13:51:51  <Error323> haha
2010-11-26T13:52:09  <medrimonia> I've some good ideas, but the problem is that it'll maybe work on one twentieth of the loss and it's pretty hard to write down in code for me
2010-11-26T13:52:40  <medrimonia> I've got to learn more about oriented object languages for the next contest I think
2010-11-26T13:52:55  <sanddbox> object oriented languages*
2010-11-26T13:53:00  <Error323> what's ur background medrimonia ?
2010-11-26T13:53:18  <medrimonia> (Thanks sanddbox)
2010-11-26T13:53:24  <sanddbox> i'm nitpicky :P
2010-11-26T13:53:42  <medrimonia> Error323: I'm just a second year student in informatics
2010-11-26T13:54:52  <Error323> i see, cool
2010-11-26T13:55:00  <medrimonia> But the big problem is that the teachers want to begin slowly, so we aren't allowed to use any global variable and as example, I was just ignoring the .sort() function in python
2010-11-26T13:55:20  <medrimonia> That's why I was really implementing each little thing
2010-11-26T13:56:35  <medrimonia> I haven't seen any structure in september, that's why everything is in matrices in my program
2010-11-26T13:57:30  <medrimonia> There's things like state_stable[p_id][nb_turn][id_player] and all
2010-11-26T13:57:41  <Error323> ahh
2010-11-26T13:57:42  <Error323> ouch
2010-11-26T13:57:43  <Error323> =)
2010-11-26T13:57:52  <Mistmanov> yeah I've also been doing everything in mulitdimensional arrays..
2010-11-26T13:58:03  <Mistmanov> just the very last feature
2010-11-26T13:58:12  <Mistmanov> was a vector of vectors of a custom class
2010-11-26T13:58:24  <Mistmanov> and then I went "hey.. that was actually pretty easy.. should've started using them earlier -_-"
2010-11-26T13:58:46  <medrimonia> My functions are calling at least 6 arguments and sometimes up to thirty
2010-11-26T13:59:06  <Error323> I've got: Knapsack.h, Logger.h, Map.h, Simulator.h, vec3.h, timer.h
2010-11-26T13:59:20  <medrimonia> Mistmanov: Yes I can understand... I think this experience has learned me a lot.

2010-11-26T14:35:21  <Error323> well he could be misleading on tcp
2010-11-26T14:35:26  <davidjliu> heh, I just beat iouri. yay

2010-11-26T14:36:29  <mega1> he has improved quite a lot in the past days
2010-11-26T14:37:11  <mega1> my bots have a very good record against him, it's Accoun that's my bane
2010-11-26T14:37:34  <antimatroid> i've actually had not too bader run against him in the last couple of days too
2010-11-26T14:37:49  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm going to bed before a last day of tweaking

2010-11-26T16:38:42  <McLeopold> Yeah, I've still got ideas I want to implement, but I spent too much time tracking down bugs.
2010-11-26T16:39:12  <boegel> I didn't change anything to my bot the last week-and-a-half
2010-11-26T16:39:24  <boegel> I've basically just been playing around with a GA for tuning it
2010-11-26T16:39:42  <boegel> exported a whole bunch of parameters to the outside world for tuning
2010-11-26T16:39:42  <McLeopold> I don't think I'm to that stage yet.
2010-11-26T16:39:53  <boegel> neither am I probably
2010-11-26T16:40:15  <McLeopold> Most of my stuff is just exact calculations.
2010-11-26T16:40:16  <boegel> but I noticed I wasn't going to get to the top 100 by observing, evaluating and fixing anyway
2010-11-26T16:40:25  <McLeopold> The only tuning I could to is target selection.
2010-11-26T16:40:30  <boegel> McLeopold: no thresholds to tune?
2010-11-26T16:40:38  <boegel> I have a bunch of magic thresholds

2010-11-26T16:40:43  <McLeopold> A few, but none worth tuning.
2010-11-26T16:40:51  <boegel> and I can disable parts of my strategy
2010-11-26T16:40:53  <McLeopold> I've tried to remove all magic numbers.
2010-11-26T16:40:58  <boegel> not clear if they're really beneficial
2010-11-26T16:41:06  <McLeopold> I do have the modular part. :)
2010-11-26T16:41:23  <boegel> that's worth a tuning try
2010-11-26T16:41:32  <boegel> what happens if you disable small pieces :)
2010-11-26T16:41:36  <boegel> ah well
2010-11-26T16:41:39  <boegel> this has been a very fun ride
2010-11-26T16:41:46  <boegel> it got me back into Haskell too
2010-11-26T16:41:59  <boegel> which was worth it by itself
2010-11-26T16:42:02  <McLeopold> I have, DefenseBot, FunnelBot and a couple others that I can plug in.

2010-11-26T16:51:16  <boegel> the bot has
2010-11-26T16:51:31  <boegel> in each turn, it runs in each of the modes sequentially
2010-11-26T16:51:36  <boegel> first, it runs in conquer mode

2010-11-26T16:52:03  <boegel> then, ...
2010-11-26T16:52:12  <boegel> it probably isn't the best strategy ever

2010-11-26T19:43:31  <sanddbox_> make sure to fix the logout as well
2010-11-26T19:44:42  <janzert> why do we care if you can get logged out by following a link?
2010-11-26T19:45:27  <sanddbox_> i don't
2010-11-26T19:45:32  <pgpaskar> I think the point is that nothing should be vulnerable to the attack
2010-11-26T19:45:34  <sanddbox_> although it would be possible to embed it in an image tag
2010-11-26T19:45:39  <pgpaskar> in general the pages should be "immune"
2010-11-26T19:45:53  <sanddbox_> all i would have to do is change my forum sig to have an [img]logout link[/img]
2010-11-26T19:46:01  <sanddbox_> no link following required and completely invisible
2010-11-26T19:46:11  <janzert> logout is actually just a link not a form submission or anything, so there isn't actually a way to "fix" it like the other.
2010-11-26T19:46:14  <pgpaskar> i think phpbb already facilitates bbcode
2010-11-26T19:46:20  <sanddbox_> janzert: , yes there is
2010-11-26T19:46:30  <sanddbox_> require the session id to be sent as well
2010-11-26T19:46:35  <sanddbox_> i believe that's how the phpbb logout does it
2010-11-26T19:46:47  <pgpaskar> phpbb logout isn't part of the contest site, though
2010-11-26T19:47:03  <sanddbox_> i was giving an example

2010-11-26T19:47:29  <pgpaskar> oh
2010-11-26T19:47:46  <janzert> I'd still have to change the logout to be a form submission of some sort though right?
2010-11-26T19:47:59  <sanddbox_> just use GET
2010-11-26T19:48:03  <sanddbox_> http://ai-contest.com/forum/ucp.php?mode=logout&sid=55f788c8456e89d6c63c4ac14fcbcc2f

2010-11-26T19:48:49  <sanddbox_> janzert: it doesn't have to be a form in the sense you're thinking of it
2010-11-26T19:48:52  <janzert> yeah, that'd work
2010-11-26T19:48:55  <sanddbox_> you don't need a "submit" button or anything

2010-11-26T20:21:14  <janzert> specifically the map_id is the database id for the map

2010-11-26T20:22:26  <McLeopold> I could just get the game state from spz on turn 1?

2010-11-26T20:44:30  <McLeopold> davidjliu: do you have any issues with timeouts?  do you have any type of check?
2010-11-26T20:44:34  <Terr__> Zannick: As far as I can tell. It certainly launches on my comp, and I can type in planets and type go etc.
2010-11-26T20:44:40  <davidjliu> McLeopold: yeah, I have a check now
2010-11-26T20:44:49  <McLeopold> I put it a check to make sure I stop doing stuff after 850 ms, but I still got a timeout
2010-11-26T20:44:58  <Terr__> Zannick: True, but then guess who has to worry about timezones and getting things exact? ;)
2010-11-26T20:45:01  <davidjliu> Mine's at 800 ms, I think
2010-11-26T20:45:11  <Terr__> Well, not timezones, per-se, but server timezones.
2010-11-26T20:45:41  <McLeopold> 800ms and no issues?
2010-11-26T20:45:46  <Zannick> well, the person who puts the counter in has to worry
2010-11-26T20:45:52  <Zannick> but no one else does.
2010-11-26T20:46:21  <Terr__> Zannick: Still need to peg it to the correct server timestamp
2010-11-26T20:46:41  <Zannick> the website's on one server, iirc
2010-11-26T20:46:48  <davidjliu> Um, I haven't had any issues since I added it
2010-11-26T20:46:57  <McLeopold> okay, good to know
2010-11-26T20:47:01  <davidjliu> through 12-13 games-ish
2010-11-26T20:47:35  <Zannick> Terr__: anyway, re: crashing, there's a replay script you could try, that will replay the game to your bot
2010-11-26T20:47:44  <Zannick> if you have python
2010-11-26T20:48:46  <Terr__> Zannick: I'm pretty sure whatever it is isn't on the input side: I've got some test cases that use gamestates (via the bookmarklet) to test that the state-of-the-universe prediction code is working OK
2010-11-26T20:49:08  <Terr__> Maybe I  have an extra space between "go" and "\n" or something dumb like that.
2010-11-26T20:49:24  <Zannick> that would be rejected as unparseable, i believe
2010-11-26T20:54:28  <Terr__> Hm. No. Just digit-space-digit-space-digit-newline-g-o-newline
2010-11-26T20:54:58  <Terr__> If it was a problem with the compile/run code, I'd expect it to affect all Java entries.
2010-11-26T20:55:49  <Zannick> how long is it taking to respond on the first turn? if you're doing a lot, you might be exceeding the time limit
2010-11-26T20:56:04  <Zannick> i think that's hard to do, though
2010-11-26T20:56:25  <burny> blah, looking over some game replays.. I don't think I can get any significant increase in performance, without spending lots of time on it :\
2010-11-26T20:56:30  <burny> and can't be bothered
2010-11-26T20:58:03  <Terr__> Zannick: No, this version is deliberately lobotomized
2010-11-26T20:58:29  <Terr__> Zannick: Every turn it takes the first friendly planet it can find and sends everything it has at the first enemy planet it can find.
2010-11-26T20:59:07  <Zannick> i don't have any idea, sorry
2010-11-26T20:59:13  <Terr__> Alas.
2010-11-26T20:59:25  <Terr__> Going to try on the TCP server.
2010-11-26T21:00:04  <aizu> burny: that's how I feel
2010-11-26T21:00:11  <Terr__> I spent way too much time making architecture-astronautics and fast distance-lookups and not enough on the real stuff.
2010-11-26T21:00:43  <Terr__> So I'm really hoping there's going to be a "second round" to the contest in some way/shape/form.
2010-11-26T21:02:24  <aizu> 4 hours left :O
2010-11-26T21:02:30  <burny> 28
2010-11-26T21:03:28  <aizu> oh, you're right
2010-11-26T21:03:33  <McLeopold> Terr__: ditto
2010-11-26T21:03:39  <aizu> I definitely thought it was saturday already
2010-11-26T21:05:56  <antimatroid> it is saturday already :)
2010-11-26T21:06:29  <Terr__> McLeopold: The biggest blocker for me is how to glue everything together and trying to grasp a lot of the math I didn't go through in college.
2010-11-26T21:07:34  <McLeopold> Terr__: I'm trying to stick to the basic math operations, + - * /  :)
2010-11-26T21:07:36  <Terr__> If there's a V2, I'll probably cut down what I have and release it as a starter pack... Java with Maven and generates the submit-ready .zip file as part of the build process.
2010-11-26T21:07:53  <McLeopold> Terr__: yeah, I really need that too
2010-11-26T21:09:21  <Terr__> Right now I'm vainly trying to finish a system that tries to "meet in the middle", generating a small number of sets of moves (for a low branching factor) and then a separate minimax-ish tree part.

2010-11-26T21:56:47  <janzert> also fyi the actual command used to run a java bot is "java -jar MyBot.jar"

2010-11-26T21:57:21  <Terr__> Uploading now for cross-check with the official site
2010-11-26T21:58:11  <Terr__> And it's not a processing-time issue, it's too brain-dead for that.

2010-11-26T21:58:37  <Terr__> Compile message shows the java->class conversion is at least happening
2010-11-26T21:58:42  <Zannick> so it isn't that...
2010-11-26T21:58:55  <Zannick> maybe the java isn't finding main correctly?
2010-11-26T21:59:06  <janzert> Zannick: do we know that bix is using packages now?

2010-11-26T21:59:27  <Zannick> Terr__: okay
2010-11-26T21:59:37  <Zannick> janzert: no, but it means java compilation isn't broken
2010-11-26T22:00:04  <janzert> ahh, yeah I know everything still works if packages aren't used
2010-11-26T22:00:12  <janzert> I tested that to make sure
2010-11-26T22:02:06  <Terr__> Well, even if my bot is still broken tomorrow, I'll have a java starter package for the next contest which can use Maven to automatically build a submittable .zip.
2010-11-26T22:02:16  <Terr__> Small levels of code-reuse ;)
2010-11-26T22:02:48  <Zannick> i just use a makefile to automate that :)

2010-11-26T22:08:57  <Terr__> I mean in the sens that you have a set of actions you want to take, and some of them are satisfied by a fleet entirely from world A, while you could also satisfy it with two fleets from A and B which meet up at the destination.

2010-11-26T22:31:04  <janzert> Should be a line something like "Found MyBot.java. Compiling this entry as Java" and the actual commands used to compile it should follow that

2010-11-26T22:37:59  <Zannick> you probably want some way to embed your logging settings in a class, or have the program actually read from an external file
2010-11-26T22:38:10  <Terr__> burny: I'm planning to pull an all-nighter and end up with something that tries to eke out value from every spare millisecond ;)
2010-11-26T22:38:13  <burny> most obviously.. if you attack with the 'right numbe rof units', you will do worse, if you don't also 'defend planets under threat or attack'
2010-11-26T22:38:17  <Zannick> i believe that the created jar should be at the top level.
2010-11-26T22:38:41  <Terr__> Zannick: Ideally I'd use an entirely different logging framework, but I settled on java.util.logging very early on because the package limitation meant it was a tremendous PITA to use external libs
2010-11-26T22:39:29  <Zannick> yeah...
2010-11-26T22:39:38  <Terr__> Zannick: Currently what happens is the build process (via Maven) swaps out a different logging.properties for testing and a different one for "real" builds
2010-11-26T22:39:47  <Terr__> The latter just makes double-extra-sure that nothing comes out
2010-11-26T22:39:49  <Zannick> sorry about that
2010-11-26T22:40:38  <Terr__> I think if I had to re-do things I'd try SLF4J

2010-11-26T22:43:03  <Terr__> Wow, Wikipedia pages with math are really good at making me understand things *less* than I did before.
2010-11-26T22:43:39  <Zannick> i'm pretty sure everything i learned in high school i would need to study for a few hours to remember how to do again
2010-11-26T22:44:30  <Terr__> My general philosophy is it's OK to forget a lot of stuff from High School or College as long as you keep a basic familiarity with the framework.
2010-11-26T22:44:48  <Terr__> Not so much a confidence of: "I know that", but "I can know that if you give me a minute to refresh my memory."
2010-11-26T22:46:15  <Terr__> channel seems pretty dead, but...if there was a "PlanetWars 2", what would be just one or two new wrinkles that would make it interesting without obsoleting too much prior code?
