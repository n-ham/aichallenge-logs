2010-10-21T00:52:02  <Mathnerd314> antimatroid: no; I currently have some junk bot in 2000th place or something
2010-10-21T00:52:43  <antimatroid> my current bot crashes every time i run it
2010-10-21T00:52:49  <Zepp> amstan: hmm i still don't see it. also i can't manage the admin group
2010-10-21T00:52:51  <antimatroid> but i'm in the middle of a big overhaul of my back end
2010-10-21T00:53:03  <rebelxt_> just watched "A Beautiful Mind" for the second time.  what a great movie, especially now that Nash equilibrium actually makes sense... anyone remember the movie?
2010-10-21T00:53:19  <antimatroid> yeah, movie was kind of lame :P
2010-10-21T00:53:21  <amstan> Zepp: sigh, hold on, this interface is confusing
2010-10-21T00:53:38  <Mathnerd314> I've seen it a couple times.
2010-10-21T00:53:41  <amstan> Zepp: now?
2010-10-21T00:53:42  <antimatroid> john nash was a mathematician not an economist
2010-10-21T00:53:46  <Zepp> amstan: yeah, i am pretty close to just changing it from the mysql shell :P
2010-10-21T00:53:58  <antimatroid> was/is if you will
2010-10-21T00:53:59  <rebelxt_> antimatroid: i was still surprised how much of it was in sync with Nash's real life story
2010-10-21T00:54:00  <Zepp> amstan: that seems to have worked
2010-10-21T00:54:14  <amstan> Zepp: for some reason the admin group was not fully admin, idk why
2010-10-21T00:54:26  <antimatroid> i'm more of a neumann fanboy anyway :P
2010-10-21T00:54:50  <antimatroid> that man was a true freak
2010-10-21T00:55:23  <antimatroid> nash equilibrium isn't really all that surprising tbh, the idea of finding a fixed point in a structure is nothing new
2010-10-21T00:55:50  <antimatroid> and i'm pretty sure he didn't come up with the fixed point theorem used to prove the existence of a mixed strategy nash equilibrium
2010-10-21T00:56:05  <antimatroid> having said that i still think it's cool, just not as astounding as some of the things neumann did
2010-10-21T00:56:52  <Zepp> amstan: fixed i believe
2010-10-21T00:57:10  <rebelxt_> he was a grad student back then, so that's pretty impressive in my book. neumann did tons that's true
2010-10-21T00:58:25  <rebelxt_> well, i still had fun watching the movie for the 2nd time. first time i watched it i did not even remember much of game theory since i graduated long long  ago
2010-10-21T00:58:44  <amstan> Zepp: cool
2010-10-21T00:58:49  <antimatroid> if i do a phd i expect the thesis to be on game theory :P
2010-10-21T00:59:01  <Zepp> amstan: so people want to reset their contest account too?
2010-10-21T00:59:14  <rebelxt_> after this contest, you gotta do it!
2010-10-21T00:59:17  <amstan> Zepp: oh yeah, they want lots of things, check the introductions forums
2010-10-21T00:59:55  <Zepp> hehe i don't really have time to look at everything sadly
2010-10-21T01:00:26  <Zepp> i was sort of trying to avoid this time sink this term :-/
2010-10-21T01:02:21  <Zepp> amstan: do you watch the mailing list much?
2010-10-21T01:02:40  <amstan> Zepp: yeah, but i choose to not to much
2010-10-21T01:02:45  <amstan> i don't have time for a lot of this either
2010-10-21T01:03:12  <Zepp> amstan: yeah, understandable. I am just wondering if you have been following the cloud server talk and such
2010-10-21T01:03:24  <amstan> not really
2010-10-21T01:03:38  <amstan> i still do not know why we picked cloud servers and not user sponsored servers
2010-10-21T01:03:51  <Zepp> no idea
2010-10-21T01:04:09  <amstan> and like...
2010-10-21T01:04:14  <amstan> contestbot: seen j3camero
2010-10-21T01:04:14  <contestbot> amstan: j3camero was last seen in #aichallenge 2 weeks, 2 days, 2 hours, 44 minutes, and 28 seconds ago: <j3camero> amstan: yes, but no names, haha.
2010-10-21T01:04:21  <amstan> that ^^
2010-10-21T01:04:39  <Zepp> ouch

2010-10-21T01:08:15  <Zepp> I usually just ping him on gtalk
2010-10-21T01:08:33  <antimatroid> you need to allow people to change their about me and organisation :P

2010-10-21T01:12:43  <amstan> Zepp: yeah, though, one of the problems is that there were changes in the site that were not commited to svn

2010-10-21T01:23:03  <janzert> or maybe I misunderstood what Zannick meant

2010-10-21T01:23:26  <amstan> well.. it's still applicable

2010-10-21T01:24:08  <Zannick> 2010-09-10.log:1984:23:18 < j3camero> Did you guys see the new policy for merging changes into trunk? It's decentralizing. Now your code reviews can be approved by any other developer. Be responsible, though. Try to get negative reviews. Don't avoid critical reviewers just to push your change.
2010-10-21T01:24:24  <amstan> Zannick: isn't that already in?
2010-10-21T01:24:53  <Zannick> maybe i misunderstood what he meant?
2010-10-21T01:25:10  <janzert> the first line of For Commiters says in big bold letters "Do not ever commit any changes to the trunk."
2010-10-21T01:25:11  <amstan> idk.. his message implies that policy is on the wiki already, but i can't see it

2010-10-21T01:29:03  <amstan> Zepp: won't work for commenting on stuff and writing reviews
2010-10-21T01:29:04  <Zepp> amstan: meh i dont need to commit anything right now
2010-10-21T01:29:09  <amstan> ok
2010-10-21T01:29:45  <Zepp> i might ping jeff but at the moment i know pretty well nothing of the code base anyway
2010-10-21T01:30:02  <Zepp> i've only seen parts of it during the summer when it was still being worked on haha
2010-10-21T01:30:37  <amstan> Zepp: so.. there's 2 important folders in planetwars/: backend and www
2010-10-21T01:30:56  <amstan> in each one there's a login file for the system
2010-10-21T01:31:07  <amstan> and lots of other files
2010-10-21T01:31:21  <amstan> hacked together scripts

2010-10-21T01:32:03  <amstan> yeah..
2010-10-21T01:32:38  <amstan> this contest needs a rewrite
2010-10-21T01:32:53  <amstan> then maybe i would be open to coding for it too
2010-10-21T01:33:12  <Zannick> i will be around in december to help with that
2010-10-21T01:33:26  <amstan> also.. git, or something decentralized
2010-10-21T01:33:26  <Zannick> i have many ideas, hopefully most of them good :)
2010-10-21T01:33:49  <amstan> right now we have this monstrosity of a svn repo
2010-10-21T01:33:52  <amstan> with branches..
2010-10-21T01:34:06  <Zepp> you could use git-svn
2010-10-21T01:34:16  <Zepp> but yeah git/hg would be nicer probably
2010-10-21T01:34:31  <amstan> Zepp: the problem's mostly with deploying those changes, and updating the server
2010-10-21T01:34:37  <amstan> it's not the frontend that bothers me
2010-10-21T01:34:47  <Zepp> ah okay

2010-10-21T01:59:20  <Zannick> d3c1ph3r: just go ahead
2010-10-21T01:59:35  <d3c1ph3r> the problem is that i have a 2-d array just containing my remaining ships from each planet as i recurse through my tree it takes away from my remaining ships pending on what ship i used to attack
2010-10-21T01:59:55  <d3c1ph3r> i made it global because i didn't know if i was passing it wrong (which i wasn't)
2010-10-21T01:59:59  <janzert> ARGH, there are two or more copies of the code on the server now I have to figure out which of each is actually used
2010-10-21T02:00:03  <d3c1ph3r> but anyways one second its one value and the other its a nother
2010-10-21T02:00:18  <amstan> janzert: where?
2010-10-21T02:00:37  <janzert> under /home/contest and under /var/www...
2010-10-21T02:00:37  <amstan> janzert: there's one in ~contest/ai-challenge.com/ and one for www, which i forgot where it was
2010-10-21T02:00:39  <Zannick> so the values in your array are being changed while you are looking at them?
2010-10-21T02:00:50  <amstan> janzert: yes, one's for the backend, one's for the www
2010-10-21T02:01:04  <janzert> yeah, that's what I'm coming to think
2010-10-21T02:01:09  <d3c1ph3r> in my method its a recursive tree where it takes one planet over it calls that same method loosk for a nother planet to attack with my remaining ships
2010-10-21T02:01:17  <janzert> why though, why?
2010-10-21T02:01:37  * janzert runs in circles some more :P
2010-10-21T02:01:39  <d3c1ph3r> now my global method keeps track of all my ships which at this point its size 1 with just 100 ships
2010-10-21T02:01:44  *** Utkarsh <Utkarsh!~admin@117.201.91.170> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-21T02:02:16  <d3c1ph3r> when i attack a planet it takes away from the ships then moves on to the next move when it pops back of the system stack it changes it back to its original value but my problem is before i pop off
2010-10-21T02:02:55  <Zannick> janzert: yeah, that seems excessive
2010-10-21T02:03:01  <Zannick> just use symlinks or some such
2010-10-21T02:03:02  <janzert> amstan: are you pretty certain that the backend code under /var/www isn't actually used?
2010-10-21T02:03:04  <d3c1ph3r> one minute i have 61 shits then i do a method to check to see if its full! a safety check for later calls, and it returns true when it should return false, i did a print before the method one second i have 61 ships then i have zero ships hwen it goes into that method
2010-10-21T02:03:13  <d3c1ph3r> ships*
2010-10-21T02:03:13  <janzert> Zannick: yeah
2010-10-21T02:04:03  <Zannick> so before you call this method you have 61 ships, and after you call it you have 0?
2010-10-21T02:04:16  <d3c1ph3r> im pretty good at java and at first thought something was fishy with the system stack so i made new copies of the array and passed that now im just doing it globally so it only gets changed one step at a time but its changing somewhere with out me saying to change it
2010-10-21T02:04:21  <d3c1ph3r> yeah
2010-10-21T02:04:26  <d3c1ph3r> and its a global array
2010-10-21T02:04:28  <d3c1ph3r> ?
2010-10-21T02:04:35  <janzert> anyone remember the svn command to see what revision the current checkout is at?
2010-10-21T02:04:36  <Zannick> this is your check that you have...what?

2010-10-21T02:05:23  <amstan_> janzert: no, i'm not
2010-10-21T02:05:24  <d3c1ph3r>  public static boolean noShips(){         int full = 0;         for(int i = 0; i < remainShips.length;i++){             test1 = remainShips[i];             if(remainShips[i] <= leaveBehind){                 full++;             }         }         test2 = full;         if(full == remainShips.length)             return true;         else             return false;     }

2010-10-21T02:05:37  <janzert> ahh yeah svn info is what I was looking for
2010-10-21T02:05:43  <amstan_> d3c1ph3r: use pastebin if you have lots of code
2010-10-21T02:05:49  <amstan_> d3c1ph3r: try not pasting in here
2010-10-21T02:06:06  <Zannick> yes
2010-10-21T02:06:09  <Zannick> well, anyway
2010-10-21T02:06:21  <Zannick> what are test1 and test2?
2010-10-21T02:06:37  <d3c1ph3r> http://pastebin.com/6L2sfeKT
2010-10-21T02:06:38  <janzert> so the backend code under /var/www is an umodified checkout from revision 250 so definitely not used :/
2010-10-21T02:06:49  <d3c1ph3r> i use that for when i print my file i see what values they receive
2010-10-21T02:07:12  <amstan_> janzert: ok, does it matter though?
2010-10-21T02:07:13  <d3c1ph3r> after every added node i create a file showing the new state and the old state of game plus variable outputs
2010-10-21T02:07:16  <d3c1ph3r> no
2010-10-21T02:07:31  <d3c1ph3r> it doesnt miscellaneous code
2010-10-21T02:07:34  <Zannick> so the results are test1 is 61 and test2 is 0?
2010-10-21T02:07:44  <d3c1ph3r> no the file prints 0 and 1
2010-10-21T02:07:55  <janzert> just that there are misleading bits laying around
2010-10-21T02:08:05  <Zannick> okay, so test1 is 0 and test2 is 1, you're saying?
2010-10-21T02:08:12  <d3c1ph3r> yeah
2010-10-21T02:08:13  <Zannick> and then it returns true
2010-10-21T02:08:14  <d3c1ph3r> and right before the file
2010-10-21T02:08:16  <d3c1ph3r> yeah
2010-10-21T02:08:20  <d3c1ph3r> it has zero ships
2010-10-21T02:08:23  <d3c1ph3r> but listen to this
2010-10-21T02:08:30  <d3c1ph3r> at the start of the method i do a copy into a new array
2010-10-21T02:08:36  <amstan_> guys.. address to people, there's 2 conversations going on, it's hard to differentiate
2010-10-21T02:08:49  <Zannick> amstan_: it's really easy. :P
2010-10-21T02:08:53  <d3c1ph3r> and print those values simultaneousness and it has the r ight values
2010-10-21T02:09:11  <d3c1ph3r> but no where between i change the valeus of the global array
2010-10-21T02:09:13  <d3c1ph3r> values*
2010-10-21T02:09:13  <amstan_> janzert: so what are you trying to do?
2010-10-21T02:09:28  <janzert> amstan_: get svn back in sync with the server
2010-10-21T02:09:50  <d3c1ph3r> makes no sense
2010-10-21T02:10:06  <d3c1ph3r> btw my conversation with everyone so i can't private i need multiple inputs
2010-10-21T02:10:09  <janzert> amstan_: so it appears now that I need to get the backend directory in sync with what is under ~/contest and the www directory with what is under /var/www
2010-10-21T02:10:23  <janzert> amstan_: getting there :)
2010-10-21T02:10:29  <amstan_> yeah, pretty much
2010-10-21T02:10:36  <amstan_> watch out to not commit login stuff
2010-10-21T02:10:38  <Zannick> d3c1ph3r: well, with test1 being 0, remainships[i] is definitely being set to 0 somewhere.
2010-10-21T02:10:48  <janzert> amstan_: yep, being careful

2010-10-21T04:54:20  <aerique> delt0r: does JBotManager actually read the .jbotmanager file?  can I enable to always show lines in it?
2010-10-21T04:54:43  <delt0r> It should always read it yes
2010-10-21T04:55:20  <delt0r> you can just add a line and next time you start it --that cmd line bot should be loaded
2010-10-21T04:55:34  <Error323> whoohoo moar servers :D
2010-10-21T04:55:35  <mega1> aerique: you are not using WITH-TIMEOUT yet, are you?
2010-10-21T04:55:44  <aerique> mega1: nope
2010-10-21T04:56:07  <aerique> delt0r: what do i need to put in it exactly to enable lines to be drawn from fleets to planets in replays?
2010-10-21T04:56:21  <mega1> aerique: it's broken in 1.0.11, I had to backport timer.lisp
2010-10-21T04:56:47  <delt0r> oh--so the .jbotmanger file only saves bot cmd lines
2010-10-21T04:56:55  <mega1> _and_ lower the timeout to 0.8s but I guess that's due to main server being so weak.
2010-10-21T04:56:57  <delt0r> no other config is saved
2010-10-21T04:57:10  <aerique> mega1: oh dear, could you blog it up for others and make it available?  or on the forums?
2010-10-21T04:57:22  <mega1> aerique: yes, I will
2010-10-21T04:57:30  <delt0r> aerique: so you need to click the drawLines check box at the bottom...

2010-10-21T04:58:10  <delt0r> It draws a line from the fleet to the destination... it does not draw anything to the source planet
2010-10-21T04:58:28  <aerique> mega1: already had to take out a naive pathfinding algo because of timeouts
2010-10-21T04:59:02  <mega1> the main server is very slow, it favors fast algos
2010-10-21T04:59:03  <aerique> delt0r: i know, i always turn it on in replays
2010-10-21T04:59:20  <delt0r> right...
2010-10-21T04:59:31  <delt0r> well saving the gui state is a pita
2010-10-21T04:59:38  <delt0r> so i didn't do it
2010-10-21T04:59:38  <aerique> delt0r: i'll just unpack the jar and enable it in the source then :)
2010-10-21T04:59:43  <delt0r> yea
2010-10-21T05:00:01  <delt0r> I can change the default... some others didn't like it however.
2010-10-21T05:00:11  <delt0r> but not till next bug fix
2010-10-21T05:00:34  <aerique> delt0r: nah, otherwise others have to turn it off again :)

2010-10-21T07:51:16  <Veracious> how big is the benefit of using a compiled language like c++ when compared with an interpreted one in terms of this challenge?
2010-10-21T07:53:23  <dmj111> In the last challenge (tron), compiled languages made a bigger difference.
2010-10-21T07:54:03  <dmj111> This time, so far, interpreted languages can be fast enough.   If someone discovers how to do minimax or something like that, intepreted languages will fall behind.

2010-10-21T12:06:32  <rommel> haha
2010-10-21T12:06:35  <rommel> I'll say.
2010-10-21T12:06:43  <raedwulf> i have a simple memory management syste
2010-10-21T12:06:45  <raedwulf> system*
2010-10-21T12:06:51  <rommel> Do you rebuild the entire gamestate each time? Or just update
2010-10-21T12:06:57  <raedwulf> it is a slight bit of a hassle, but im familiar with it
2010-10-21T12:07:16  <raedwulf> i separate the static gamestate from the dynamic gamestate in my structures
2010-10-21T12:07:28  <rommel> ie planets from fleets?
2010-10-21T12:07:42  <raedwulf> sorry thats wrongly said (static data) and (dynamic state)
2010-10-21T12:07:47  <raedwulf> yep, planets are static mostly

2010-10-21T12:10:43  <raedwulf> i.e. i have the driver inside it as well

2010-10-21T12:11:30  <rommel> the driver?
2010-10-21T12:11:51  <raedwulf> i call it a driver, i.e. the main loop
2010-10-21T12:11:56  <rommel> gotcha
2010-10-21T12:12:24  <raedwulf> essentially the key bit is sscanf(p+2, "%lf %lf %d %d %d",....)
2010-10-21T12:12:26  <raedwulf> for parsing
2010-10-21T12:12:29  <rommel> haha
2010-10-21T12:12:35  <rommel> that would have been useful :)
2010-10-21T12:12:52  <rommel> I actually wrote the entire parser in C
2010-10-21T12:12:58  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-10-21T12:13:00  <rommel> then decided I'd be better of using C++ and the STL
2010-10-21T12:13:14  <raedwulf> i started off with a C++ implementation
2010-10-21T12:13:19  <krokkrok> why write a new parser different from the starter bot, whats the point?
2010-10-21T12:13:20  <raedwulf> but im so much more comfortable with C
2010-10-21T12:13:57  <raedwulf> krokkrok: they seeem to do a lot of appends and its not as clean
2010-10-21T12:14:07  <raedwulf> also, reinventing the wheel is cool
2010-10-21T12:14:08  <krokkrok> why does it matter ?
2010-10-21T12:14:34  <raedwulf> gives me time to keep my hands busy as i think about  the algorithm (but i wrote it in C)
2010-10-21T12:14:37  <rommel> Well krokkrok, I wanted to learn a bit, had never used the STLs before... seemed a good place to start
2010-10-21T12:14:38  <raedwulf> there's no C starter pack afaik
2010-10-21T12:15:09  <rommel> plus it looks pwetty haha
2010-10-21T12:15:59  <rommel> I also needed to change a few things in how it handled the overall system
2010-10-21T12:16:01  <krokkrok> STL is the devil
2010-10-21T12:16:14  <rommel> So regardless I had to modify it
2010-10-21T12:17:00  <rommel> Hated how I couldn't store variables to planets and then they'd be deleted on the vector reset
2010-10-21T12:17:37  <rommel> It only allowed for reaction, no prediction or prior knowledge could be had at all

2010-10-21T12:19:18  <raedwulf> i think i know what the problem is now, but it made some fo the code lots simpler when i used a fgets and a sscanf
2010-10-21T12:19:40  <raedwulf> fread for reading stdin
2010-10-21T12:19:47  <raedwulf> i was trying to read an entire state into one huge buffer

2010-10-21T12:21:05  <rommel> But I have yet to implement my AAN and get it learning... that'll take a while... THEN, and only then, once its trained... will it hopefully work :D

2010-10-21T12:32:49  <rommel> krokkrok: how am I going to train it? Well the inputs are easy; but I'm still looking into how I'm going to determine a fitness for it; I might just end up using a mix of Evolution, ACO for path determination and Backprop for the planet and fleet decisions... one of which I've already tested and it works well in this situation... just whether it will actually be worth it in the end is my interest... it probably just won't be ab

2010-10-21T12:34:29  <rommel> luckily I've written them all in plug and play format in C++ so implementing isn't the difficult part, just the pre and post processing on the inputs and outputs is where the hours will be spent
2010-10-21T12:35:03  <krokkrok> i have no idea how to train, if I did, I'd do that and with the competition :D

2010-10-21T12:39:48  <rommel> krokkrok, to train, you need to loop back the output into the input so it can learn from itself and its previous, but the most important part is the fitness of net, basically what your saying is a good outcome and a bad one... how to determine that; since the feedback can only come after a result
2010-10-21T12:40:08  <rommel> is going to be a fun task
2010-10-21T12:40:25  <Naktibalda> input is huge, isn't it?
2010-10-21T12:41:01  <rommel> I was thinking of game theory as a comparison... but then its sortive like... well I'm just going to train the network to do game theory... which could be done heuristically so...

2010-10-21T12:43:02  <rommel> Unless I set it up so it could learn from replays... infact that would probably be the best way... that way you can determine a fitness function easily ... :)

2010-10-21T12:43:35  <rommel> Ragebot is the simplest thing to beat haha
2010-10-21T12:43:39  <rommel> Just don't do anything... it loses
2010-10-21T12:43:44  <JamesMG> yeah exactly
2010-10-21T12:43:47  <rommel> Not hard to determine a ragebot either
2010-10-21T12:44:06  <JamesMG> I mean to prevent it from learning that as a valid strategy based on wins against ragebot
2010-10-21T12:44:27  <rommel> yeah... hence I think selective large samplings of replays will be the best solution
2010-10-21T12:44:42  <rommel> Real time learning sounds like it may be very difficult...
2010-10-21T12:45:04  <rommel> Simply because the inputs and outputs are not immediately determined

2010-10-21T14:18:08  <rommel> like I said
2010-10-21T14:18:15  <rommel> to get the 4 closest
2010-10-21T14:18:36  <rommel> I just did the following: sweep 2m, if not N found, then increase sweep radius, but, dont sweep old
2010-10-21T14:19:24  <rommel> I'm thinking now though that a 2D array may just be better... lol
2010-10-21T14:19:58  <lavalamp_> a 2d array is definitely better
2010-10-21T14:21:16  <lavalamp_> also it's probably more useful to return indexes (vector<int>) rather than copies of the planets

2010-10-21T14:43:39  <lavalamp_> Also I run the opponent's moves as if mine were already made... I'm still debating if that will help my bot or paralyze it
2010-10-21T14:43:41  <JamesMG> and adjustable depth tree, I think
2010-10-21T14:45:32  <lavalamp_> mine spends 50% of its time predicting the future... I think I can get that down by not predicting all the way through the end until someone asks for it
2010-10-21T14:46:07  <JamesMG> how far do you predict/plan?  I was thinking I'd have mine add plies until it was nearly out of time
2010-10-21T14:46:14  <JamesMG> then pick one and act, each turn
2010-10-21T14:46:49  <lavalamp_> I do that too, but my move generators will be looking into the future

2010-10-21T14:48:55  <JamesMG> I'm most interested in how you build the tree, since that's where mine is falling down at the moment
2010-10-21T14:49:41  <lavalamp_> I don't actually keep a tree around, maybe I should...
2010-10-21T14:49:57  <JamesMG> mine is moving a lot more data than it needs to also, though
2010-10-21T14:50:25  <lavalamp_> I just remember the best thing I've found so far and all the moves on all the current stack levels
2010-10-21T14:50:37  <lavalamp_> Yours is Java?
2010-10-21T14:50:42  <JamesMG> C#
2010-10-21T14:50:46  <lavalamp_> ah ok
2010-10-21T14:51:44  <lavalamp_> Maybe I could squeeze out a few more nodes if I stored a tree, hm
2010-10-21T14:51:48  <JamesMG> I originally had it copying the game board for each node, and then each planet evaluation/ship count prediction would return a planet object as well

2010-10-21T14:54:23  <McLeopold> Are you guys having any success with minimax then?
2010-10-21T14:54:34  <lavalamp_> remains to be seen, still
2010-10-21T14:55:05  <McLeopold> How do you solve the problem of too many branches?  Do you just go 1 or 2 ply?
2010-10-21T14:55:07  <JamesMG> mine operates at the sample bot level, +1
2010-10-21T14:55:51  <lavalamp_> yeah mine is probably going to end up at 1 or 2 ply... it does 3 right now but most of my move generators do nothing so that will change
2010-10-21T14:56:02  <JamesMG> I solved that initially by giving it a very limited list of options, mostly individual orders my other bot would make
2010-10-21T14:56:18  <McLeopold> And then the same for the opponent I would guess.
2010-10-21T14:56:22  <lavalamp_> I'm doing something similar
2010-10-21T14:56:38  <lavalamp_> for the opponent I will have some other generators too, such as ragebot
2010-10-21T14:56:48  <JamesMG> I assumed(obviously incorrectly) that the other would run similar tactics
2010-10-21T14:56:52  <JamesMG> just for the sake of getting it running
2010-10-21T14:57:48  <McLeopold> Do you pair down insignificate boards?

2010-10-21T14:58:14  <McLeopold> For instance, if every planet is > 2 away, keep going until a planet changes hands?
2010-10-21T14:58:22  <McLeopold> Then consider that a node.
2010-10-21T14:58:51  <McLeopold> Kinda like forced moves in chess.
2010-10-21T14:58:59  <JamesMG> hadn't got that far into it
2010-10-21T14:59:27  <lavalamp_> I was thinking about doing that but I think it might skip some important decisions (like when you build up enough ships to take a neutral)
2010-10-21T14:59:47  <McLeopold> Okay, so let's think about it, on map 7.
2010-10-21T14:59:53  <McLeopold> What's the best opening?
2010-10-21T15:00:37  <McLeopold> Obviously you don't want to take the center +5 planets with minimal force, you will get sniped.
2010-10-21T15:01:04  <JamesMG> my current subset/knapsack code is obviously broken now that I ran it on map 7
2010-10-21T15:01:06  <JamesMG> so thanks for that
2010-10-21T15:01:10  <McLeopold> So, throw everything to the cheap +2 right there, and react.
2010-10-21T15:01:41  <McLeopold> But, if you throw everything to the closer +5, you will get it for sure, and have better position.
2010-10-21T15:01:48  <lavalamp_> is it the same map 7 as on the tcp server?
2010-10-21T15:01:54  <McLeopold> I think so.
2010-10-21T15:02:02  <JamesMG> this looks like a case of throwing all 100 to the 12 ship +5 neutral
2010-10-21T15:02:22  <lavalamp_> ok yeah I would throw all 100 at the 4 cost neutral and see what happens
2010-10-21T15:03:23  <McLeopold> so, if you had minimax only concerned about the home planets, +5 center and +2 planets, what would it do?
2010-10-21T15:03:38  <phreeza> I think it must be a diferent one on tcp, can't see what you are talking about
2010-10-21T15:03:47  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=612185
2010-10-21T15:03:54  <McLeopold> phreeza: it's the same
2010-10-21T15:04:13  <McLeopold> you could try ignoring all other planets and see how far your minimax goes.
2010-10-21T15:04:19  <lavalamp_> I'm going to give it more options than that, I think
2010-10-21T15:04:34  <phreeza> clicked the wrong line X(
2010-10-21T15:05:34  <McLeopold> I've already got a chess engine written in python.
2010-10-21T15:05:40  <McLeopold> I should try an use it.

2010-10-21T15:06:23  <McLeopold> I think the big difference is that moves happen at the same time
2010-10-21T15:06:40  <JamesMG> also fleet ship counts complicate the decisions
2010-10-21T15:06:43  <lavalamp_> yeah that is a very big difference
2010-10-21T15:07:02  <JamesMG> just for kicks I ran my last workable minimax bot on map 7
2010-10-21T15:07:16  <McLeopold> what happened?
2010-10-21T15:07:26  <JamesMG> it opens with a quickest return on ship investment move to the 12 and 4 ship neutrals
2010-10-21T15:07:35  <JamesMG> kinda dumb
2010-10-21T15:07:51  <lavalamp_> mine would do nothing
2010-10-21T15:07:53  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-10-21T15:08:08  <JamesMG> leaves the 12 snipable, and then went after the 12 closer to the enemy, haha
2010-10-21T15:09:11  <McLeopold> how many ply?
2010-10-21T15:09:49  <JamesMG> 5 right now, I think
2010-10-21T15:10:00  <McLeopold> I think it would take at least 20 to see the snipe.
2010-10-21T15:10:33  <lavalamp_> the way mine is set up it would take 1 ply to see the snipe
2010-10-21T15:10:34  <JamesMG> wait, I took it down to 3
2010-10-21T15:10:49  <lavalamp_> because my generators look into the future

2010-10-21T15:11:41  <JamesMG> mine is supposed to be seeing the state of the planet as many turns into the future as the map is wide
2010-10-21T15:11:56  <JamesMG> so if the furthest planet is 10 turns, it's supposed to know what enemy ships are there
2010-10-21T15:12:00  <JamesMG> but it's clearly screwing that up

2010-10-21T15:13:59  <McLeopold> I think an good way to prune moves would be only consider neutrals with incoming fleets or "good" planets.
2010-10-21T15:14:23  <McLeopold> When the enemy expands to a "bad" planet, you could add it's twin to the list.
2010-10-21T15:14:39  <lavalamp_> interesting idea
2010-10-21T15:14:45  <McLeopold> It would be a good way to get more ply at the start, where you really need it.
2010-10-21T15:15:16  <JamesMG> I'm expanding the plies and running it on that map, be a minute though
2010-10-21T15:15:50  <McLeopold> So, for moving at the same time, I suppose you would pick the set of moves that raise your average expected num_ships the most?
2010-10-21T15:16:22  <McLeopold> Kinda like a prisoners delima matrix, but hugh?
2010-10-21T15:16:23  <phreeza> os i'm a bit late, mine goes for the +5 in the middle with 12
2010-10-21T15:16:25  <lavalamp_> I actually build a table and play prisoner's dilemma
2010-10-21T15:16:38  <phreeza> and sends 45 consistently, even though its monte carly
2010-10-21T15:16:40  <phreeza> o
2010-10-21T15:16:53  <lavalamp_> McLeopold: yeah, exactly
2010-10-21T15:17:10  <phreeza> but the again, my bot sucks ;)
2010-10-21T15:17:26  <lavalamp_> it's better than mine is atm
2010-10-21T15:17:45  <JamesMG> mine only runs 4 turns before it times out at 20 plies
2010-10-21T15:17:56  <JamesMG> interestingly, it does the same dumb opener
2010-10-21T15:18:12  <JamesMG> I guess it isn't using the extra depth correctly
2010-10-21T15:18:23  <lavalamp_> do you stop-I'm-out-of-time code in there?
2010-10-21T15:18:31  <lavalamp_> *do you have
2010-10-21T15:18:34  <JamesMG> not in this version
2010-10-21T15:18:41  <phreeza> i let mine run for 10s for this
2010-10-21T15:18:53  <JamesMG> I'll bump up the time limit and see if it recovers the start
2010-10-21T15:19:12  <lavalamp_> that was a pain to implement, it makes my minimax function look awful with all the state keeping
2010-10-21T15:19:46  <McLeopold> As soon as I perfect RamBot, I will probably move on to minimax
2010-10-21T15:19:47  <JamesMG> mine's very recursive, and each iteration takes nearly no time
2010-10-21T15:20:00  <lavalamp_> what's RamBot do?
2010-10-21T15:20:01  <JamesMG> so I should be able to just check the time before each iteration and stop it
2010-10-21T15:20:21  <lavalamp_> ah, I expect my iterations to be kinda slow
2010-10-21T15:20:39  <McLeopold> It's an attempt to put constant pressure on the enemy instead of waiting.
2010-10-21T15:20:51  <McLeopold> So, there would be no giant fleet buildups.
2010-10-21T15:21:14  <McLeopold> I figure I've got a better bot in a miser map.
2010-10-21T15:21:32  <lavalamp_> interesting
2010-10-21T15:21:37  <JamesMG> Oh, it doing a bad start is me being dumb
2010-10-21T15:21:47  <JamesMG> I never gave it the move to throw all ships at a single planet
2010-10-21T15:22:01  <McLeopold> how about 99?
2010-10-21T15:22:18  <JamesMG> it only has the option to take them with the minimum required right now
2010-10-21T15:22:25  <McLeopold> oh
2010-10-21T15:22:54  <McLeopold> so 0 or 13 to the center only?
2010-10-21T15:23:04  <JamesMG> yup
2010-10-21T15:23:30  <McLeopold> okay, that would also prune your branches down quite a lot.
2010-10-21T15:23:46  <JamesMG> I'll add a move to the center real quick, be a few
2010-10-21T15:23:55  <JamesMG> just to see if it's smart enough to spot the snipe
2010-10-21T15:23:59  <McLeopold> the proper amount would be....
2010-10-21T15:24:08  <phreeza> can it snipe?
2010-10-21T15:24:30  <JamesMG> in theory.  it hasn't run long enough to do it yet
2010-10-21T15:25:09  <JamesMG> it's move list right now is a subset of planets, with ship count estimations when the fleets would arrive
2010-10-21T15:25:14  <phreeza> so when you say only as many as neccesary, that looks ahead to the future?

2010-10-21T15:33:19  <cfaftw> what's the best way to commit a bug fix to my bot, then revert back to before the change to work on a new fix, then commit that
2010-10-21T15:33:33  <cfaftw> two orthogonal bug fixes, basically
2010-10-21T15:33:49  <cfaftw> that i want to test independently to make sure they are orthogonal :)
2010-10-21T15:34:14  <lavalamp_> easiest way might be to clone your directory
2010-10-21T15:34:19  <lavalamp_> but after hg commit
2010-10-21T15:34:39  <lavalamp_> hg update -r xxxx will take you back to the prior revision
2010-10-21T15:34:40  <Zannick> branch, or clone a new repo
2010-10-21T15:34:48  <cfaftw> so... hg commit, hg clone, hg revert, hg commit?
2010-10-21T15:34:52  <lavalamp_> where (xxxx is the rev number)
2010-10-21T15:35:03  <cfaftw> oh, update
2010-10-21T15:35:04  <cfaftw> ok
2010-10-21T15:35:08  <cfaftw> thats ound simple enough
2010-10-21T15:35:11  <Zannick> if you clone a new repo, you can work on them both at the same time, but you are taking 2x the space
2010-10-21T15:35:11  <cfaftw> sounds*

2010-10-21T15:42:48  <cfaftw> oh
2010-10-21T15:42:56  <lavalamp_> my best one got up to 150 Elo or so
2010-10-21T15:42:59  <cfaftw> yeah... my bot is still purely heuristics
2010-10-21T15:43:13  <cfaftw> started rewriting it a week and a half ago
2010-10-21T15:45:10  <lavalamp_> is the rewrite heuristics, too?
2010-10-21T15:45:15  *** aerique <aerique!~euqirea@aerique.xs4all.nl> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-21T15:45:20  <cfaftw> yeah
2010-10-21T15:45:25  <cfaftw> i'm going to milk this heuristic bot for all its worth, then in early november i might investigate some more "advanced" techniques
2010-10-21T15:47:15  <lavalamp_> It was getting hard for me to add stuff to my first bot (heuristics) without breaking stuff
2010-10-21T15:47:33  <cfaftw> lavalamp_, that's why i decided to rewrite... it got too complicated
2010-10-21T15:47:38  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@213.88.2.78> has quit IRC ()
2010-10-21T15:47:43  <cfaftw> i took what i learned from my old bot and organized it better
2010-10-21T15:48:00  <JamesMG> I tore all the nasty code out of my old bot yesterday also to start fresh
2010-10-21T15:48:11  <JamesMG> only kept the framework I'd built
2010-10-21T15:48:19  <lavalamp_> Yeah, if my current minimax thing doesn't work out at least I will have a pretty decent framework
2010-10-21T15:48:40  <cfaftw> i'm really curious about using a neural-net
2010-10-21T15:48:50  <cfaftw> but i don't know anything about programming ANNs
2010-10-21T15:49:10  <JamesMG> I have a fuzzy text matching neural net laying around from work...
2010-10-21T15:49:23  <JamesMG> wonder if I could apply it here
2010-10-21T15:49:46  <lavalamp_> maybe you could use one to figure out what "good" planets are... I'm not sure how you would get full moves out of one
2010-10-21T15:50:04  <JamesMG> yeah that's why I didn't start with it
2010-10-21T15:50:46  <JamesMG> I'd bet you could use one to evaluate the value of a planet at various stages though
2010-10-21T15:51:15  <cfaftw> do you guys know where to find examples of ANN code? meaning, somebody gives some code, explains what it does and how it learns, and how it can be applied?
2010-10-21T15:51:36  <cfaftw> (no, i haven't thoroughly googled yet :)

2010-10-21T15:53:32  <cfaftw> :[
2010-10-21T15:53:39  <codefun> You can issue more than one order per turn, if you have the issueorder() function used in a loop, right?

2010-10-21T15:58:09  <cfaftw> i wonder if his short tutorial will make me understand genetic algorithms thoroughly
2010-10-21T15:58:27  <JamesMG> based on that image I have my doubts

2010-10-21T16:10:06  <lavalamp_> They took too long? :)
2010-10-21T16:10:09  <JamesMG> and type "go" if it goes to a console

2010-10-21T16:29:46  <javagamer> It would be best if it played multiple rounds against the same bots so it learned their strategies.

2010-10-21T16:32:39  <cfaftw> why do account management systems always impose some lower limit on name length?

2010-10-21T16:34:05  <cfaftw> also... their 6 character minimum does not count periods
2010-10-21T16:35:39  <janzert> yeah, IIRC you can add periods into any existing username and it will still work (e.g. janzert@gmail.com will work as j.an.zert@gmail.com too)

2010-10-21T17:42:58  <janzert> they seem to fail in a couple hours at most, but I'm trying to track down why
2010-10-21T17:43:08  <janzert> in the meantime I'm keeping up what I can
2010-10-21T17:43:29  <Nargil> Btw. http://ai-contest.com/organization_profile.php?org_id=195 <- Gordon Freeman @ CERN ! Nice humour. Wonder if it's him: http://api.ning.com/files/8fil5gmLgTbnvHiB9qe7ZlP*PesdnleY89Wa1XSwTN2VJOF-MRR*27IOl5yulIJ9a4-EFM6xPdeCTe4IvZZRdFoRF1G9upzR/GordonFreemanSpottedAtCERN.jpg
2010-10-21T17:43:40  <Nargil> janzert: thanks for the effort
2010-10-21T17:44:16  <Zannick> to be clear, there's no restrictions on organization on signup
2010-10-21T17:44:38  <Nargil> So the CERN part might be fake ?
