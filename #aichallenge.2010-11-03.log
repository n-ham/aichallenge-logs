2010-11-03T01:03:01  <raedwulf> thats better anyways
2010-11-03T01:03:08  <raedwulf> if you do c++, do boost
2010-11-03T01:04:10  <TravisD> Do they have boost on the contest server?

2010-11-03T01:04:45  <demerzel_> well you can bring the headers over manually
2010-11-03T01:05:01  <TravisD> fair enough
2010-11-03T01:05:05  <demerzel_> i have nullstream for example
2010-11-03T01:05:08  <Frontier> TravisD: I removed all boost code once for the contest. It was a pain.
2010-11-03T01:05:11  <demerzel_> a lot of boost is just clever macros hehe

2010-11-03T07:57:20  <antimatroid> i've sort of gone through the maths for it
2010-11-03T07:57:26  <antimatroid> but i've never actually tried implementing anything
2010-11-03T07:57:47  <Error323> grrr antimatroid  =)
2010-11-03T07:57:52  <antimatroid> i did an or course on markov chains and linear programming last year and just finished a stats unit where we did a topic on mcmc
2010-11-03T07:57:53  <songoftheweave> I'm trying to do a heavily pruned adversarial search... but the state space is pretty darn big.
2010-11-03T07:58:27  <antimatroid> i have tried decision trees, game trees (various kinds) and zero sum games
2010-11-03T07:58:29  <Error323> its *far too big*
2010-11-03T07:58:50  <Error323> i tried alpha beta
2010-11-03T07:58:50  <antimatroid> i'm not just randomly checking lots of moves for them though, at each node i select just a few
2010-11-03T07:59:02  <Error323> yeah, and that's why it fails
2010-11-03T07:59:12  <antimatroid> i haven't implemented alpha beta, i need promising results before  i care about throwing more in to make it change
2010-11-03T08:00:12  <songoftheweave> Well, the thing about this game is that a lot of the possible moves are very similar to other possible moves.
2010-11-03T08:01:17  <Error323> that's a bold statement
2010-11-03T08:01:19  <Error323> =)
2010-11-03T08:01:23  <Error323> explain
2010-11-03T08:01:27  <antimatroid> i'm going under the assumption that many are clearly dominated
2010-11-03T08:01:37  <antimatroid> it's a matter of finding the undominated moves
2010-11-03T08:01:44  <antimatroid> then playing those
2010-11-03T08:01:50  <antimatroid> but atm i even need to pick the "best" of those
2010-11-03T08:02:03  <songoftheweave> well, some are identical. Issuing 1 order of n ships from x to y is identical to issuing n orders of 1 ship from x to y

2010-11-03T08:03:15  <raedwulf> AJC: hi Alex J. Champandard?
2010-11-03T08:03:18  <AJC> hey, I'm a bit fuzzy on the spec... http://ai-contest.com/specification.php
2010-11-03T08:03:25  <AJC> raedwulf: yes.
2010-11-03T08:03:27  <songoftheweave> But you only need to search the moves that aren't isomorphic.
2010-11-03T08:03:27  <antimatroid> yes, but with say my decision trees, i will consider taking planet 1 and then 2 as well as 2 and then 1
2010-11-03T08:03:35  <Error323> Alex?
2010-11-03T08:03:36  <antimatroid> simply because the moves will quite often be made up differently
2010-11-03T08:03:43  <songoftheweave> But further, what I'm saying is that sending 7 ships from x to y is very similar to sending 8 ships from x to y
2010-11-03T08:03:46  <raedwulf> ^^, mailed you about terravox some time ago :P
2010-11-03T08:04:08  <Error323> songoftheweave: not true
2010-11-03T08:04:23  <AJC> the spec. says advancement (adding planet growth) happens before the arrival, but in the Java PlayGame, the simulation seems to do the opposite.
2010-11-03T08:04:31  <antimatroid> yeah, i wish there was more "cooked up" maps for the contest
2010-11-03T08:04:33  <AJC> raedwulf: ah, that must have been a while back!
2010-11-03T08:04:38  <antimatroid> such that decisions were a lot harder to make
2010-11-03T08:05:03  <antimatroid> AJC: the specification is correct
2010-11-03T08:05:27  <AJC> antimatroid: is the PlayGame.jar in the starter kits also correct?
2010-11-03T08:05:31  <raedwulf> AJC: yea i noticed that in java playgame too
2010-11-03T08:05:35  <antimatroid> there were quite a few bugs with the original engine that needed to be ironed out
2010-11-03T08:05:41  <antimatroid> AJC: get jBotManager
2010-11-03T08:05:41  <AJC> antimatroid: ah, shit.
2010-11-03T08:05:47  <AJC> antimatroid: URL?
2010-11-03T08:05:53  <antimatroid> look in the forums
2010-11-03T08:05:58  <antimatroid> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751
2010-11-03T08:06:03  <antimatroid> i bookmarked it, forgot
2010-11-03T08:06:09  <AJC> the starter kit hasn't been updated though, that's scary.
2010-11-03T08:06:13  <raedwulf> typically, java playgame isn't accurate
2010-11-03T08:06:14  <antimatroid> biggest issue was neutral resolution
2010-11-03T08:06:16  <Error323> AJC: you can also use this one: http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/ its good
2010-11-03T08:06:22  <antimatroid> it was surprisingly hard to pick between the feasible options
2010-11-03T08:06:30  <songoftheweave> It's more similar than sending 8 ships from x to z or 8 ships from x to y. I'm using the simplifying assumption that I can ignore quite a few of the moves and one that I search will be close enough to it. *shrugs* I am interested to see if it is a valid assumption. heh
2010-11-03T08:06:45  <antimatroid> the starter packages are a guide, meh
2010-11-03T08:06:48  <raedwulf> there's also a python playgame based off the server backend
2010-11-03T08:07:01  <AJC> Error323: I have a new visualizer, just the old PlayGame
2010-11-03T08:07:12  <antimatroid> this game is ridiculously hard anyway
2010-11-03T08:07:14  <raedwulf> Zannick: its yours right?
2010-11-03T08:07:19  <antimatroid> i still have no idea how to try and solve stuff
2010-11-03T08:07:20  <Error323> ah k
2010-11-03T08:07:23  <AJC> raedwulf: oh, that sounds nice.  do you you have a link?
2010-11-03T08:07:29  <raedwulf> trying to remember it

2010-11-03T08:07:39  <raedwulf> its up in my logs somewhere
2010-11-03T08:07:43  <antimatroid> optimal moves switch from the tiniest changes in numbers
2010-11-03T08:07:56  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-03T08:08:24  <antimatroid> i miss the comfort of tron, max 4 moves per turn
2010-11-03T08:08:38  <Error323> saying 8 ships from x to y is very similar to 7 from x to y is a mistake as its consequences can be drastic over time
2010-11-03T08:09:11  <AJC> most of the packages out there use the old buggy Java PlayGame... you should really get the word out, update the front page.
2010-11-03T08:09:15  <antimatroid> it's fairly easy to cook up a 3 planet map where you should send everything you have and all growth into the future at the middle planet
2010-11-03T08:09:17  <AJC> I only scan the forums.
2010-11-03T08:09:17  <songoftheweave> Sure it's a mistake. simplifying assumptions usually are. I'm exploring whether it's a small enough mistake.

2010-11-03T08:09:54  <antimatroid> what i want is a magical function to resolve battles from both players making moves with any of their future ships
2010-11-03T08:10:16  <Error323> AJC: under what name are you participating?
2010-11-03T08:10:19  <antimatroid> i'm not sure anyone has that right

2010-11-03T08:11:24  <AJC> antimatroid: I resolve battles, i was doing it according to the playgame.jar but I was occasionally off due to that bug :-)
2010-11-03T08:11:29  <AJC> antimatroid: yes.
2010-11-03T08:11:46  <antimatroid> AJC: but with both player making moves each turn both with their current planets and into the future?
2010-11-03T08:11:48  <Error323> AJC: I don't see you on the leaderboard under france anyway =)
2010-11-03T08:11:55  <Error323> what's ur rank?
2010-11-03T08:12:03  <AJC> 460 or something.
2010-11-03T08:12:13  <AJC> the new bot suffers from those prediction bugs now
2010-11-03T08:12:16  <AJC> hehe
2010-11-03T08:12:20  <antimatroid> it gets messy when they start cancelling out the moves they planned to make
2010-11-03T08:12:28  <Error323> i had that aswell at start :/
2010-11-03T08:12:41  <Error323> but the specs are correct indeed.
2010-11-03T08:13:07  <antimatroid> AJC: have you got the correct amount for claiming neutrals and correct neutral resolution?
2010-11-03T08:13:56  <AJC> antimatroid: I thought I had, then I realized the spec. was different, so updated it... and now it resolves differently in PlayGame.
2010-11-03T08:14:17  <AJC> and here I am looking for a better implemented version (which IMHO, should be updated in all starter kits)
2010-11-03T08:14:17  <d0ugal> antimatroid: I just wrote a battle resolver - seemed fairly straight forward - just step through the incoming fleets
2010-11-03T08:14:40  <antimatroid> d0ugal: are you making moves from both players into the future?
2010-11-03T08:14:42  <AJC> antimatroid: but yes, I have it.
2010-11-03T08:14:44  <antimatroid> that's where it gets complicated
2010-11-03T08:14:45  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4275), dmj111(4171), bix0r4ever(4148), Hazard(4141), shangas(4103), george(4081), Accoun(4059), felixcoto(4049), GreenTea(4018), rsergio(4005)
2010-11-03T08:14:52  <d0ugal> antimatroid: Yeah
2010-11-03T08:14:59  <AJC> antimatroid: I don't make moves for the enemy player, just predict what he could do.
2010-11-03T08:15:12  <d0ugal> antimatroid: Only issue I've got is if they arrive at the same time
2010-11-03T08:15:23  <antimatroid> i will let the enemy send ships from a planet they don't even own yet
2010-11-03T08:15:29  <d0ugal> I only started it last night though and it mostly works so far
2010-11-03T08:15:35  <antimatroid> for reference, this is my neutral resolution

2010-11-03T08:17:29  <antimatroid> d0ugal: what are you doing when one of your "future fleets" gets rendered void from one of their newer "future fleets"?
2010-11-03T08:17:48  <antimatroid> just not sending that anymore? the whole "move" or just that individual fleet?
2010-11-03T08:17:58  <antimatroid> or throwing out that entire branch?

2010-11-03T08:28:54  <bhasker> antimatroid http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=836240
2010-11-03T08:29:05  <bhasker> your routing code needs fixing
2010-11-03T08:29:17  <bhasker> you keep routing without checking if an enemy can take the planet if it sends forward
2010-11-03T08:29:22  <bhasker> i just sniped your edge planets
2010-11-03T08:29:31  <bhasker> before you could reinforce them
2010-11-03T08:29:52  <antimatroid> bhasker: that's alright, it hasn't got anything for that yet
2010-11-03T08:30:22  <antimatroid> i'm considering switching to making moves to planets without a specified final time
2010-11-03T08:30:32  <raedwulf> does anyone have the link for the python playgame based off the engine?
2010-11-03T08:30:49  <bhasker> what do you mean specified final time?
2010-11-03T08:31:15  <antimatroid> at my move has a single destination and "arrive time" then  send ships from numerous source planets and at many time points
2010-11-03T08:31:41  <antimatroid> but rather than pick a time i want my move to be executed i might just add times to send fleets and make moves for a planet into the future at once
2010-11-03T08:32:17  <antimatroid> i sweep each planet to see what i can send at which point, then make moves based of those amounts
2010-11-03T08:32:28  <dmj111> http://bitbucket.org/zannick/planet-wars/src ?
2010-11-03T08:32:49  <antimatroid> it's hard to get it all right, i think i still have a few bugs
2010-11-03T08:33:09  <antimatroid> bhasker: wow, my bot sucked then
2010-11-03T08:33:34  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-03T08:33:38  <antimatroid> as soon as it starts losing it tries to expand like crazy, making it lose even faster
2010-11-03T08:33:49  <bhasker> my bot has the same problem
2010-11-03T08:33:57  <Error323> bhasker: how do you prevent a situation like this: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=836289
2010-11-03T08:33:58  <bhasker> so i track a few parameters
2010-11-03T08:34:10  <bhasker> i was just looking at that game
2010-11-03T08:34:13  <raedwulf> dmj111: thanks
2010-11-03T08:34:20  <bhasker> trying to understand why i didn't take any new neutrals
2010-11-03T08:34:22  <raedwulf> AJC: look at dmj111 's link
2010-11-03T08:34:28  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-03T08:34:35  <nullkuhl> dmj111: what happens to a bot that copies every move that it's opponent is doing ?will it always get a draw ? or will it always lose because of the turn advantage to the opponent
2010-11-03T08:34:35  <antimatroid> i wont attack unless i plan to take it for at least one turn
2010-11-03T08:34:37  <raedwulf> there were some problems on windows, but give it a go
2010-11-03T08:34:44  <Error323> well i won this but i also often lose because i keep raging that planet
2010-11-03T08:34:47  <Error323> and failing at it
2010-11-03T08:34:54  <bhasker> though i think i know why
2010-11-03T08:34:57  <antimatroid> nullkuhl: copybot has been done, doesn't do very well
2010-11-03T08:34:58  <bhasker> i was already low on ships
2010-11-03T08:35:06  <bhasker> taking a neutral will probably have killed me
2010-11-03T08:35:17  <bhasker> i was down by 30 ships
2010-11-03T08:35:18  <Error323> yeah, prolly
2010-11-03T08:35:32  <bhasker> though since most of your ships were in flight
2010-11-03T08:35:36  <bhasker> it shold have been relatively safe
2010-11-03T08:35:46  <bhasker> there must be a way of determining if enemy is mostly in flight
2010-11-03T08:35:52  <bhasker> then taking the neutral is safe
2010-11-03T08:35:52  <Error323> yeah
2010-11-03T08:35:57  <bhasker> since enemy can't redirect them
2010-11-03T08:35:58  <Error323> i've been experimenting with that aswell
2010-11-03T08:35:59  <dmj111> nullkuhl: someone (zannick I think) did that.  It should lose, if it only copies, because of the turn advantage.
2010-11-03T08:36:03  <Error323> but not successfully so far.
2010-11-03T08:36:24  <bhasker> antimatroid http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=836321

2010-11-03T08:37:17  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-03T08:37:24  <antimatroid> lol, jambachili just expanded too much on the first turn against me
2010-11-03T08:37:27  <bhasker> i don't watch it live other than by following logs
2010-11-03T08:37:45  <Error323> i just wait :P
2010-11-03T08:37:49  <antimatroid> jBotManager lets you watch them live
2010-11-03T08:37:51  <antimatroid> it's awesome

2010-11-03T08:38:33  <antimatroid> he dc before i even finished him
2010-11-03T08:39:32  <bhasker> i saw jBotManager maybe i should use that
2010-11-03T08:39:57  <bhasker> thats a bug, no way he should have launched 58 ships with you like 3 turns away
2010-11-03T08:40:04  <bhasker> 5 turns rather
2010-11-03T08:40:12  <bhasker> this is like a rage bot fail
2010-11-03T08:40:17  <bhasker> he probably loses to rage bot on this map
2010-11-03T08:40:40  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-03T08:40:53  <antimatroid> i seem to beat shampoo more than not atm
2010-11-03T08:41:11  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/getplayer?player=antimatroid.heuristicbot recent history
2010-11-03T08:41:39  <AJC> antimatroid: does the jBotManager allow you to keep running games on the TCP server in a loop?
2010-11-03T08:41:53  <antimatroid> it lets you specify the number of reps
2010-11-03T08:42:05  <antimatroid> not sure you can set it at infinity, but you should be able to find something suitably large
2010-11-03T08:42:08  <antimatroid> you can save the games too
2010-11-03T08:43:07  <antimatroid> AJC: most importantly, it lets you play your own bot
2010-11-03T08:43:21  <AJC> antimatroid: oh, by hand?
2010-11-03T08:43:26  <antimatroid> but you can only send ship amounts in x0% increments, which sucks
2010-11-03T08:43:37  <antimatroid> like 10% of planets ships, 20, ..., 100
2010-11-03T08:44:21  <AJC> ah, then it's a cosmetic feature :-)
2010-11-03T08:44:32  <antimatroid> it's still great for debugging
2010-11-03T08:44:48  <antimatroid> i just wish i could specify the exact number of ships to send
2010-11-03T08:44:56  <AJC> yeah,
2010-11-03T08:45:09  <antimatroid> you will want to increase the timeout limit when playing as a human, you can hit enter to "finish your turn"
2010-11-03T08:48:20  <antimatroid> oh man, this is going to be close, shampoo has me on growth by one, i have more ships
2010-11-03T08:48:53  <AJC> antimatroid: hehe, you need professional commentary, Starcraft 2 like.
2010-11-03T08:49:02  <bhasker> woohoo #27 on official!
2010-11-03T08:49:07  <bhasker> first time i broke top 30
2010-11-03T08:49:10  <antimatroid> i haven't got anything on official atm
2010-11-03T08:49:17  <antimatroid> it's under "youwillfail" when i do
2010-11-03T08:49:27  <Error323> bhasker: gratz, I shall soon follow you =)
2010-11-03T08:49:32  <bhasker> hehe:)
2010-11-03T08:49:47  <antimatroid> damn, he overtook me with less than 10 moves remaining
2010-11-03T08:50:07  <bhasker> who did?
2010-11-03T08:50:08  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure my bot should have been able to take him too :|
2010-11-03T08:50:10  <antimatroid> shampoo
2010-11-03T08:50:13  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-03T08:50:18  <bhasker> yea he is an annoying bot
2010-11-03T08:50:25  <antimatroid> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=836453
2010-11-03T08:50:30  <bhasker> though my bot does much better against him now
2010-11-03T08:50:55  <antimatroid> my bot seems to have the upper hand, but he's still causing me pain
2010-11-03T08:51:05  <bhasker> why didnt you snipe the central
2010-11-03T08:51:08  <bhasker> when he launched the first time
2010-11-03T08:51:16  <bhasker> you waited till he captured it
2010-11-03T08:51:32  <antimatroid> cause i had just sent 29 out
2010-11-03T08:51:37  <antimatroid> i couldn't afford to send more from that planet
2010-11-03T08:51:47  <antimatroid> oh wait, no i hadn't
2010-11-03T08:51:48  <antimatroid> hmmm
2010-11-03T08:51:56  <antimatroid> couldn't back it up?
2010-11-03T08:52:03  <antimatroid> i check how much they could send that turn too
2010-11-03T08:52:26  <antimatroid> yeah, i think that was it
2010-11-03T08:52:29  <bhasker> hmm he could have
2010-11-03T08:52:49  <AJC> wonder why Shampoo is stockpiling on the left.
2010-11-03T08:53:25  <antimatroid> not sure, planned for defense but not used yet, and not correctly sending ahead?
2010-11-03T08:53:38  <antimatroid> my bot might for example might consider the other 2 planets to have already been taken by me
2010-11-03T08:53:48  <antimatroid> and not use them for redistribution, but then the 9 is doin git
2010-11-03T08:54:09  <AJC> what your bot should do, once they've reached a stable state, is stream ships from your big planet at the front into the middle.
2010-11-03T08:54:24  <AJC> (you can't do an all out attack or he'll counter and take yours)
2010-11-03T08:54:30  <antimatroid> yeah, i have troubles spamming the enemy
2010-11-03T08:54:32  <bhasker> heh my bot is climbing still #26 now
2010-11-03T08:54:33  <antimatroid> he always does it too early
2010-11-03T08:54:41  <bhasker> if i make it into top 20 i will be happy
2010-11-03T08:54:48  <Error323> bhasker: its on a massive killingspree
2010-11-03T08:54:56  <AJC> bhasker: how much time have you spent on your bot?
2010-11-03T08:55:03  <bhasker> no idea lol
2010-11-03T08:55:04  <bhasker> lots
2010-11-03T08:55:08  <bhasker> its damn addictive
2010-11-03T08:55:17  <antimatroid> lol, i've been programming with every spare minute since the contest was announced
2010-11-03T08:55:19  <bhasker> though most of it has been fixing bugs
2010-11-03T08:55:22  <antimatroid> programming/thinking
2010-11-03T08:55:26  <bhasker> pretty much the same here
2010-11-03T08:55:34  <bhasker> i keep revisiting ideas
2010-11-03T08:55:41  <bhasker> i would put some heuristic in
2010-11-03T08:55:47  <bhasker> then 2 days later i would remove
2010-11-03T08:55:48  <bhasker> it
2010-11-03T08:55:51  <bhasker> back and forth
2010-11-03T08:55:54  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-03T08:55:56  <AJC> hehe
2010-11-03T08:56:14  <antimatroid> i can't get my actual ideas going without proper conflict resolution as specified before
2010-11-03T08:56:25  <antimatroid> and my move selection sucks
2010-11-03T08:56:49  <antimatroid> Errir323: what are you doing?
2010-11-03T08:56:56  <bhasker> yea it took me a long time to get conflict resolution right
2010-11-03T08:57:04  <bhasker> especially for neutrals where both me and enemy are attacking
2010-11-03T08:57:17  <Error323> antimatroid: mmm?
2010-11-03T08:57:17  <bhasker> its quite complicated to get right with coordinated launches
2010-11-03T08:57:21  <antimatroid> but are you doing future moves from both players?
2010-11-03T08:57:42  <antimatroid> what do you do when one of their future moves cancels out one of yours?
2010-11-03T08:58:00  <antimatroid> Error323: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=836546
2010-11-03T08:58:06  <Error323> oef
2010-11-03T08:58:16  <Error323> that map is just scary
2010-11-03T08:58:42  <Error323> and your attack very good
2010-11-03T08:58:53  <Error323> gg there =)
2010-11-03T08:59:17  <antimatroid> like i said before, i wont make an offensive move unless i plan to take it
2010-11-03T08:59:33  <Error323> mmm i have a different strat
2010-11-03T08:59:37  <antimatroid> although sometimes i don't decide to finish executing one, but it was intended
2010-11-03T08:59:48  <Error323> if i can attack an enemyplanet, do so with all my ships
2010-11-03T08:59:49  <antimatroid> it's very costly to have them defend all your attacks
2010-11-03T08:59:56  <Error323> it seems to be inferior :P
2010-11-03T09:00:38  <antimatroid> attacking the enemy, you don't really lose anything ship wise, you just want to maxe growth ownership
2010-11-03T09:01:48  <Error323> well yes and no
2010-11-03T09:02:05  <Error323> attacking over long distances can be dangerous
2010-11-03T09:02:16  <Error323> as in flight ships are "useless"

2010-11-03T09:02:36  <antimatroid> that's why i make attacks iff i will win the planet for at least one turn
2010-11-03T09:02:52  <antimatroid> and i'm considering changing my moves to go into the future, and not have a specified finish time
2010-11-03T09:02:54  <Error323> antimatroid: how can youu possibly know
2010-11-03T09:03:07  <Error323> since most bots have routing algorithms
2010-11-03T09:03:17  <Error323> that make it incredibly complex to predit
2010-11-03T09:03:19  <Error323> predict*
2010-11-03T09:03:40  <antimatroid> i look at all the ships they have (in fleet and on planets including future growth) inside the time i plan to take it

2010-11-03T09:04:57  <Error323> but its not working well
2010-11-03T09:05:22  <Error323> well, less good then just sending enemy fleets
2010-11-03T09:05:26  <Error323> all fleets*
2010-11-03T09:07:31  <bhasker> antimatroid why did you decide to onl commit 16 shps on turn 1
2010-11-03T09:07:35  <bhasker> thats what killed Error
2010-11-03T09:07:40  <bhasker> he committed 68
2010-11-03T09:07:42  <bhasker> to the neutral
2010-11-03T09:07:44  <bhasker> and you sniped it
2010-11-03T09:07:59  <antimatroid> because i suck when i make lots of moves first turn, so i do the suboptimal thing and make just one
2010-11-03T09:08:08  <antimatroid> if the other bot makes too many, i take them out then though
2010-11-03T09:08:12  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-03T09:08:29  <bhasker> i have been having trouble with the same thing
2010-11-03T09:08:32  <bhasker> if i expand too much
2010-11-03T09:08:34  <bhasker> it kills me
2010-11-03T09:08:48  <bhasker> a lot of games i lose bcause i decided to acquire an expensive neutral far away
2010-11-03T09:08:49  <Error323> yeah that works very counter productive for me, since I assume the enemy also maximizes growth first turn :P
2010-11-03T09:08:50  <antimatroid> try doing the one move first turn trick, you only lose 1 move on expansion
2010-11-03T09:09:10  <bhasker> well on maps with a lot of low growth planets
2010-11-03T09:09:13  <bhasker> you lose the game
2010-11-03T09:09:13  <antimatroid> and you get lots of information
2010-11-03T09:09:23  <bhasker> oops i mean plaents with low # of ship son them
2010-11-03T09:09:26  <antimatroid> not always
2010-11-03T09:09:30  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-03T09:09:37  <Error323> you can analyse the map beforehand
2010-11-03T09:09:38  <antimatroid> give it a go and see how it does
2010-11-03T09:09:40  <Error323> and decide then
2010-11-03T09:09:40  <bhasker> let me try it

2010-11-03T09:10:42  <Error323> its a RPS decision i thinkk
2010-11-03T09:11:00  <Error323> until yyou can deduce a good heuristic :P
2010-11-03T09:11:49  <antimatroid> i think most of my losses to shampoo are from him taking and managing to claim the middle planet

2010-11-03T09:12:47  <antimatroid> last time i put it up it was crashing, i think the bugs should be fixed but meh
2010-11-03T09:12:53  <d0ugal> antimatroid: I don't have the code here but basically I go through the incoming fleets - in order of the moves and work out what the outcome will be
2010-11-03T09:12:53  <antimatroid> it's effort to clean out all my debugging stuff
2010-11-03T09:13:02  <d0ugal> Sorry, in order of their arrival time
2010-11-03T09:13:08  <antimatroid> d0ugal: what about fleets rendered unsendable?
2010-11-03T09:13:19  <d0ugal> rendered unsendable?
2010-11-03T09:13:49  <antimatroid> say i planned to send 15 fleets from planet 1 at time 10, but the send ships to planet 1 within that time leaving it with less than 15 shgips left
2010-11-03T09:13:54  <antimatroid> i cannot send that fleet anymore
2010-11-03T09:14:01  <d0ugal> I've setup my code to do logging and debugging only if the environment variable is set on my machine - so I can upload it without problems :D
2010-11-03T09:14:03  <antimatroid> but they* send ships
2010-11-03T09:14:27  <antimatroid> 15 ships** (I am terrible at that)
2010-11-03T09:14:47  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4254), dmj111(4157), bix0r4ever(4133), Hazard(4107), george(4071), shangas(4070), felixcoto(4027), GreenTea(4020), Accoun(4017), asavis(3975)
2010-11-03T09:14:52  <antimatroid> to make matters even worse, that 15 fleet might have only been part of a move
2010-11-03T09:15:05  <d0ugal> I didn't quite follow. You go to take planet A and then they send a fleet that will arrive first?
2010-11-03T09:15:10  <bhasker> haha my bot goes dumb
2010-11-03T09:15:10  <antimatroid> or go to when the planet is changing ownership multiple times

2010-11-03T09:15:20  <Error323> o_L
2010-11-03T09:15:22  <Error323> ah ok
2010-11-03T09:15:30  <bhasker> it doesn't account for neutrals that you may acquire
2010-11-03T09:15:31  <bhasker> in future
2010-11-03T09:15:33  <bhasker> thats why
2010-11-03T09:15:41  <antimatroid> i am making moves from both players each turn, with any ships they own at any point in time (as present scenario) and trying to simulate that gamestate
2010-11-03T09:15:46  <bhasker> i have been trying to find a good way to do that
2010-11-03T09:15:51  <bhasker> but don't have one yet
2010-11-03T09:15:52  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-03T09:15:59  <bhasker> so it just assumed it could take your home planet
2010-11-03T09:16:09  <antimatroid> and it's when i do that that problems arise
2010-11-03T09:16:20  <antimatroid> generating future states is easy enough until one does that
2010-11-03T09:16:45  <d0ugal> "does that"?
2010-11-03T09:16:47  <bhasker> lol
2010-11-03T09:16:56  <bhasker> my bot is geting dumber
2010-11-03T09:17:00  <bhasker> its doing dumb moves
2010-11-03T09:17:04  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=836719
2010-11-03T09:17:05  <d0ugal> Perhaps I'm just over simplifying the problem too much
2010-11-03T09:17:10  <bhasker> it sends 72 ships from left corner of the map
2010-11-03T09:17:14  <bhasker> to the right corner
2010-11-03T09:17:21  <bhasker> to defend a planet and loses the original

2010-11-03T09:19:59  <antimatroid> works for me :p
2010-11-03T09:20:04  <bhasker> but the bug is not because of the launch 1
2010-11-03T09:20:09  <antimatroid> ah, okay
2010-11-03T09:20:11  <bhasker> its because i am underestimating nearby ships
2010-11-03T09:20:21  <bhasker> it for some reason decided i could send 76 ships
2010-11-03T09:20:36  <bhasker> when enemy had a planet with 40 ships sitting at much shorter distance
2010-11-03T09:23:48  <Error323> i wonder how often i lose of you
2010-11-03T09:23:55  <Error323> i think more then 50% :/
2010-11-03T09:24:14  <bhasker> i am guessing its closer to even
2010-11-03T09:24:23  <bhasker> our bots behave pretty similarly
2010-11-03T09:25:03  <Error323> mmm

2010-11-03T09:46:59  <antimatroid> unless it really can snipe one further away from their stupidity

2010-11-03T09:47:30  <AJC> do we have hardware specs?

2010-11-03T09:48:16  <raedwulf> AJC: i believe its variable, because some servers seem to be able to handle more games per minute than tohers
2010-11-03T09:48:20  <raedwulf> others*
2010-11-03T09:48:22  <Error323> also i need todo other things >_>

2010-11-03T09:53:17  <antimatroid> it made no difference, but still, i've seen some weird stuff with your redistribution other times
2010-11-03T09:53:23  <antimatroid> one probably shouldn't question your ways though
2010-11-03T09:53:28  <antimatroid> they work
2010-11-03T09:54:03  <raedwulf> AJC: , you'll have to run sort of auto-tuner at the start of your bot

2010-11-03T10:47:13  <demerzel_> and a month to tweak it
2010-11-03T10:48:24  <demerzel_> i have no idea what concepts he's using but my only hope atm is to brute force a solution haha
2010-11-03T10:48:37  <demerzel_> ofc that's been my plan since the beginning
2010-11-03T10:48:52  <Error323> well

2010-11-03T10:58:50  <demerzel_> i originally coded with comments etc for releasing afterwards
2010-11-03T10:58:55  <demerzel_> now it's barely commented hardcore c++ lol
2010-11-03T10:59:12  <Error323> curses
2010-11-03T10:59:20  <Error323> yeah i'm just gonna throw it in my git account

2010-11-03T11:02:20  <antimatroid> my ip always shows up as though i'm in victoria
2010-11-03T11:02:56  <brx> antimatroid: no, but my ex flew to tasmania on monday. she's touring the island for two weeks before heading to alice springs.
2010-11-03T11:03:13  <antimatroid> ah, well tassie is awesome ;)
2010-11-03T11:03:23  <antimatroid> but i'm biased, i hate participating in queues
2010-11-03T11:04:56  <brx> i'm jealous, last time i was in australia i was ... 4 years old.

2010-11-03T11:07:30  <demerzel_> or staged launches
2010-11-03T11:09:54  <antimatroid> i think launching against the enemy fast is good
2010-11-03T11:10:01  <antimatroid> defending it's better to wait as long as possible
2010-11-03T11:10:11  <antimatroid> and expanding it just plaing difficult to do without coordinating

2010-11-03T11:14:22  <Error323> i constantly resubmit
2010-11-03T11:14:26  <Error323> nothing official about it
2010-11-03T11:14:36  <Error323> its just a pool aswell which is your testground ^^

2010-11-03T11:25:47  <demerzel_> yea it's pretty long haha
2010-11-03T11:25:54  <demerzel_> i separated out tcp stuff
2010-11-03T11:25:59  <demerzel_> so i can just remove from project
2010-11-03T11:26:01  <antimatroid> what tcp stuff?
2010-11-03T11:26:10  <demerzel_> and i do have my logic in another cpp atm but it's defined in the main header
2010-11-03T11:26:10  <antimatroid> i don't have that in any source files
2010-11-03T11:26:18  <demerzel_> oh i build tcp directly into the bot
2010-11-03T11:26:29  <antimatroid> why?

2010-11-03T11:26:42  <demerzel_> why bother compiling then linking through an exe
2010-11-03T11:26:47  <demerzel_> i can just run it directly from the ide
2010-11-03T11:26:54  <demerzel_> cost:75 lines of code
2010-11-03T11:27:00  <antimatroid> fair enough
2010-11-03T11:28:32  <demerzel_> i did originally have a proxy bot that read from file and fed to stdout
2010-11-03T11:28:37  <demerzel_> but that was a pain in the ass
2010-11-03T11:28:42  <demerzel_> once you write the socket code once you're done
2010-11-03T11:29:14  <antimatroid> meh, i just do it through jbotmanager and watch the games live
2010-11-03T11:29:31  <antimatroid> sucks when you know you're going to lose but game is going to take another 100 turns or so
2010-11-03T11:29:31  <demerzel_> eh i can wait a minute - can watch it from the log lol
2010-11-03T11:30:47  <demerzel_> is dimwit really slow or is my logger making me slow
2010-11-03T11:30:59  <JamesMG> dimwit is slow
2010-11-03T11:31:02  <demerzel_> ok good
2010-11-03T11:31:11  <JamesMG> so is JAmesMG.fun, sorry about that :)
2010-11-03T11:31:25  <demerzel_> you're fine actually - i used to hate playing flavor but i guess he fixed that
2010-11-03T11:32:09  <JamesMG> I capped that bot to 750ms give or take a few to act on the info it churns out in that time
2010-11-03T11:32:34  <JamesMG> could bump it up for TCP but that's just cheap
2010-11-03T11:34:10  <demerzel_> what does it do

2010-11-03T11:34:17  <demerzel_> yea tcp is a bit forgiving tho i understand why
2010-11-03T11:34:24  <demerzel_> it's kinda annoying when it's taking 4 seconds per turn tho
2010-11-03T11:35:41  <JamesMG> it's building as big a tree as it can demerzel_
2010-11-03T11:35:45  <JamesMG> in the 750ms
2010-11-03T11:35:52  <demerzel_> ahh
2010-11-03T11:36:15  <antimatroid> i take up to 0.9 seconds, but i'm only doing a decision tree and it often can't generate for that long before it's run out of feasible "moves"
2010-11-03T11:36:17  <demerzel_> how long would it go if you didn't cap it
2010-11-03T11:36:40  <JamesMG> mid game if it's winning, 10+ seconds
2010-11-03T11:36:48  <demerzel_> dayam
2010-11-03T11:36:52  <demerzel_> you need some c++
2010-11-03T11:36:54  <JamesMG> it's kinda dumb, exponential with owned planets
2010-11-03T11:37:03  <JamesMG> I just haven't spent the time to clean it up
2010-11-03T11:37:24  <JamesMG> which is also why it loses 85% of the time
2010-11-03T11:37:26  <AJC> do you guys have jobs?
2010-11-03T11:37:33  <AJC> do you find it hard to not think about the bot during the daytime ;-)
2010-11-03T11:37:48  <antimatroid> AJC: i work as a research assistant, when i find time, but mostly just a student
2010-11-03T11:38:03  <AJC> antimatroid: so you're doing this full time? :-)
2010-11-03T11:38:07  <JamesMG> I'm a developer, I work on my bot at work...
2010-11-03T11:38:07  <antimatroid> my uni work output has been dreadful since the start of the contest
2010-11-03T11:38:25  <AJC> hehe
2010-11-03T11:38:29  <antimatroid> i studied for graphics exam the day of it, didn't go to class since first week
2010-11-03T11:38:37  <antimatroid> studied for stats exam the day before
2010-11-03T11:38:53  <antimatroid> i have analysis saturday, adv topics in maths monday and pdes tuesday, haven't done much for them either :|
2010-11-03T11:39:24  <AJC> today's been obsessive coding for me, like yesterday, but on the bright side I've finally found a way to unify attack and defense so all options are considered equally and "objectively"
2010-11-03T11:39:36  <antimatroid> last 2 months have been obsessive coding for me
2010-11-03T11:39:50  <AJC> hehe, that's what I'm worried about.. and it's why I asked.
2010-11-03T11:40:04  <AJC> I will have to stop after today, I have a business to run :-)
2010-11-03T11:40:19  <antimatroid> good thing is i have everything set up for game trees and zero sum games once i get all my bugs worked out and some more stuff written
2010-11-03T11:40:35  <antimatroid> atm it's just using a decision tree
2010-11-03T11:40:54  <AJC> decision tree? really?
2010-11-03T11:40:55  <antimatroid> i need to make things more efficient too
2010-11-03T11:41:05  <AJC> oh, I stopped worrying about performance.
2010-11-03T11:41:09  <demerzel_> AJC: i am a developer too haha
2010-11-03T11:41:09  <antimatroid> yeah, make one move, then plan based off that
2010-11-03T11:41:16  <antimatroid> so did i, untill i started trying to make trees
2010-11-03T11:41:19  <demerzel_> stopped worrying about performance?
2010-11-03T11:41:31  <demerzel_> well that's cool until you want to look ahead more than 1 move
2010-11-03T11:41:50  <antimatroid> most of my trees remain in the "same move"
2010-11-03T11:41:51  <AJC> I'm predicting all planets ahead 40 turns, then re-evaluating everything once I've dispatched each fleet.
2010-11-03T11:41:59  <antimatroid> but i am constantly making fleets from the future
2010-11-03T11:42:02  <demerzel_> predicting state is diff
2010-11-03T11:42:16  <demerzel_> that's quick even if you implement it half-assed

2010-11-03T11:42:20  <demerzel_> (performance-wise)
2010-11-03T11:42:34  <AJC> demerzel_: are you doing some kind of game tree search then?
2010-11-03T11:42:45  <AJC> demerzel_: you still need to predict the opponent, searching won't help much.
2010-11-03T11:42:46  <JamesMG> most of my time building trees is wasted on the 9000 really dumb moves it looks at
2010-11-03T11:42:54  <antimatroid> mine are approximations of game trees
2010-11-03T11:43:02  <antimatroid> i can't possibly explore every possible move at each node
2010-11-03T11:43:07  <demerzel_> AJC: i am doing jack atm - one move minmax
2010-11-03T11:43:08  <antimatroid> you wouldn't make it past 3 turns
2010-11-03T11:43:12  <demerzel_> my state still have bugs
2010-11-03T11:43:13  <AJC> is that what all the top bots are doing?
2010-11-03T11:43:22  <demerzel_> most of the top bots claim to have trees at least
2010-11-03T11:43:32  <demerzel_> what that actually means probably varies hehe
2010-11-03T11:43:42  <antimatroid> i think a lot are still mostly heuristic bsased
2010-11-03T11:43:58  <antimatroid> people are trying and failing at bigger ideas
2010-11-03T11:44:05  <antimatroid> i could be wrong
2010-11-03T11:44:06  <AJC> yeah, I'm not convinced by planning in this case.
2010-11-03T11:44:27  <antimatroid> i think they will work, but iff one gets the details perfectly right
2010-11-03T11:44:31  <antimatroid> and that's extremely tricky
2010-11-03T11:44:39  <demerzel_> yup
2010-11-03T11:44:45  <antimatroid> that's what i'm banking on anyway
2010-11-03T11:44:46  <demerzel_> state is extremely difficult to get exactly right
2010-11-03T11:44:51  <AJC> it'll cost too much when you can get so much more out of a good heuristic based off looking ahead.
2010-11-03T11:44:55  <demerzel_> most of my advantage thus far has been superior state calc
2010-11-03T11:45:06  <demerzel_> but now that everybody is mostly caught up i have to go further lol
2010-11-03T11:45:19  <AJC> demerzel_: what makes it superior?
2010-11-03T11:45:27  <demerzel_> well just being accurate for one haha
2010-11-03T11:45:28  <antimatroid> getting it correct
2010-11-03T11:45:35  <antimatroid> the details are very messy
2010-11-03T11:45:40  <antimatroid> people needed time to work it out
2010-11-03T11:45:41  <demerzel_> but i have some numbers that most people wouldn't think of

2010-11-03T11:46:07  <antimatroid> neutral resolution i think will be the biggest mistake
2010-11-03T11:46:16  <antimatroid> and amount to claim neutral

2010-11-03T11:49:21  <demerzel_> if the game goes bad then i hook into the file and step through in IDE
2010-11-03T11:49:24  <AJC> can't we use the server's simulation then?

2010-11-03T11:51:25  <antimatroid> mega1: nup, i am terrible at my openings (1 move) and i beat him most of the time
2010-11-03T11:52:28  <demerzel_> cool i got a mega1 stdin to test against lol
2010-11-03T11:52:38  <demerzel_> something is horribly wrong :(
2010-11-03T11:52:44  <mega1> then I don't know
2010-11-03T11:52:58  <lavalamp__> wow my bot is on an impressive losing streak: http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=10821
2010-11-03T11:53:11  <antimatroid> have you considered it being him taking the middle?
2010-11-03T11:53:21  <antimatroid> i've only recently started to think that's why he causes me so much trouble
2010-11-03T11:53:37  <antimatroid> it doesn't seem like it was smart of him, but he always seems to do it and claim it
2010-11-03T11:53:53  <dmj111> AJC: there is a forum thread with updated an update playgame.jar file. http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=534
2010-11-03T11:54:17  <AJC> dmj111: can someone suggest posting this on the frontpage and updating the SDK?
2010-11-03T11:54:34  <demerzel_> i'm sure one of them works and isn't bugged
2010-11-03T11:54:45  <demerzel_> i've just had 3 bad ones so far so decided <100 lines of code was worth the hassle
2010-11-03T11:55:03  <JamesMG> I just use a local one to get rid of any obvious bugs and crashes
2010-11-03T11:55:09  <JamesMG> then throw it on TCP for actual testing
2010-11-03T11:56:05  <AJC> dmj111: ah, I think I have those already.  have those been confirmed to be the same simulation as on the server?\

2010-11-03T12:46:52  <JamesMG> Man, shampoo is the bane of my bot's existance
2010-11-03T12:47:03  <antimatroid> same for me
2010-11-03T12:47:04  <JamesMG> his bot expands under pressure very well
2010-11-03T12:47:21  <antimatroid> i don't know why he isn't ranked higher

2010-11-03T12:49:47  <hightime> SO, I attack neutral planet with 35 ships. My enemy attacks the same neutral planet with 31 ships. The neutral planet has 40 ships. What will happen?
2010-11-03T12:50:04  <JamesMG> neutral ends with 5 ships
2010-11-03T12:50:12  <demerzel_> haha damn i finally found my def bug
2010-11-03T12:50:13  <hightime> ok, thx
2010-11-03T12:50:37  <demerzel_> it kept streaming to planets with defense needed until that turn cuz i had it thinking it was sending ships to itself not the planet it was defending
2010-11-03T12:50:53  <JamesMG> I've got a weird defense problem now
2010-11-03T12:50:57  <demerzel_> is shampoo ever on irc
2010-11-03T12:51:01  <demerzel_> or is he another name like mega
2010-11-03T12:51:02  <Error323> hightime: the specs are @ the website, read them carefully
2010-11-03T12:51:06  <JamesMG> but the bot is doing better anyways
2010-11-03T12:51:22  <JamesMG> never heard anybody claim shampoo demerzel_
2010-11-03T12:51:30  <JamesMG> and it's come up a few times

2010-11-03T13:50:27  <phreeza> demerzel_: the only difference between class and struct in c++ is the default access specifier
2010-11-03T13:50:35  <phreeza> sruct is public, class is private
2010-11-03T13:51:27  <AJC> demerzel_: if you have to worry about references that disappear you're doing it wrong
2010-11-03T13:52:27  <AJC> if you need resources with no cl/ear ownership, go for some kind of smart pointer, but I'd suggest clarifying the ownership and pre-allocating for performance.
2010-11-03T13:52:42  <AJC> if I was to rewrite my bot in C++ I'd just pre-allocate all the arrays upfront
2010-11-03T13:52:53  <AJC> and refer to things with identifiers
2010-11-03T13:52:59  <demerzel_> that is exactly what i do
2010-11-03T13:53:20  <demerzel_> well whatever your definitino of identifier is
2010-11-03T13:53:30  <demerzel_> basically have structs with pre-allocated arrays before i ever hit turn 1
2010-11-03T13:53:31  <AJC> index
2010-11-03T13:53:39  <AJC> how come references are a problem?
2010-11-03T13:53:44  <demerzel_> i have no idea
2010-11-03T13:53:49  <demerzel_> semantically i'm not doing anything wrong
2010-11-03T13:53:53  <demerzel_> it just fails half the time
2010-11-03T13:53:56  <AJC> hmm
2010-11-03T13:53:57  <demerzel_> probably because i'm using vs/vc
2010-11-03T13:54:19  <AJC> GCC with full warnings catches some problems.

2010-11-03T13:57:16  <AJC> did you overwrite your array accidentally?
2010-11-03T13:57:36  <phreeza> if your reference is invalid changing it to a pointer will probably not fix that...
2010-11-03T13:57:57  <phreeza> its a lot harder to screw up a ref than a pointer

2010-11-03T14:41:11  <Error323> it fails horribly
2010-11-03T14:41:26  <Error323> and i'm gonna fix that now
2010-11-03T14:41:30  <Error323> cuz its driving me insane
2010-11-03T14:41:31  <Migi32> I just do this: if I have less total growth than the enemy, expand. Otherwise, pick a planet and go for it with everything you've got
2010-11-03T14:41:45  <demerzel_> oh nice their compile_anything takes o haha
2010-11-03T14:42:06  <Migi32> demerzel_, ?
2010-11-03T14:42:08  <Migi32> o?
2010-11-03T14:42:14  <phreeza> haha
2010-11-03T14:42:16  <demerzel_> compiled object files
2010-11-03T14:42:18  <Migi32> as in object files?
2010-11-03T14:42:20  <Migi32> oh cool
2010-11-03T14:42:29  <Migi32> so you don't even have to submit source files :P
2010-11-03T14:42:32  <demerzel_> nope
2010-11-03T14:42:33  <phreeza> thats great
2010-11-03T14:42:34  <Error323> Migi32: attacking when you are behind can give serious advantage
2010-11-03T14:42:45  <Error323> since there is no cost of capping the neutral
2010-11-03T14:42:50  <phreeza> i guess theyll fix that though?
2010-11-03T14:42:57  <demerzel_> they were talking about allowing executables
2010-11-03T14:42:57  <Zannick> um, nope
2010-11-03T14:42:59  <demerzel_> i doubt it's an issue
2010-11-03T14:43:00  <Migi32> Error323, if I'm behind I assume they can hold though
2010-11-03T14:43:08  <Zannick> all the .o files are nuked before compilation
2010-11-03T14:43:22  <demerzel_> probably an oversight since they don't include obj but i don't think they care
2010-11-03T14:43:27  <Migi32> I know it's not a great solution though, Error323
2010-11-03T14:43:37  <Migi32> that's why you don't see me on top of TCP :)
2010-11-03T14:44:38  <Error323> well i'm getting there...
2010-11-03T14:44:44  <Error323> except for that massive flaw
2010-11-03T14:44:46  <demerzel_> Zannick: nuked?  what does that mean specifically in this case
2010-11-03T14:44:54  <Zannick> if you actually manage to get a .o file without a corresponding source file to link, i would like to know
2010-11-03T14:45:11  <Zannick> demerzel_: the script performs the equivalent of rm -rf *.o MyBot
2010-11-03T14:45:13  <phreeza> yea
2010-11-03T14:45:31  <demerzel_> iirc linux that's delete *.o?
2010-11-03T14:45:42  <Migi32> well if you really want you can include the executable then have your main bot read that executable to memory and call the main() function inside it
2010-11-03T14:45:50  <Zannick> yeah, rm = remove
2010-11-03T14:46:13  <Migi32> btw don't hit enter after "rm -rf *"
2010-11-03T14:46:15  <demerzel_> oh so essentially they delete all the *.o then make new ones
2010-11-03T14:46:22  <Zannick> yeah
2010-11-03T14:46:28  <demerzel_> -recursive force
2010-11-03T14:46:32  <demerzel_> my fave
2010-11-03T14:46:41  <Error323> i once did this : rm -rf .
2010-11-03T14:46:43  <demerzel_> rm -rf ~
2010-11-03T14:46:51  <Error323> that messes ur system up pretty good
2010-11-03T14:46:55  <Zannick> touch -- *
2010-11-03T14:47:02  <Zannick> rm -- *
2010-11-03T14:47:12  <Zannick> ^ how to get rid of those tricky files
2010-11-03T14:47:15  <phreeza> lol
2010-11-03T14:47:15  <demerzel_> Zannick: well thanks for making me look twice
2010-11-03T14:47:28  <Zannick> demerzel_: no problem
2010-11-03T14:47:56  <demerzel_> while we're at it i assume gcc is c99?  afa ansi-c
2010-11-03T14:47:59  <Zannick> i organized most of that script, so i'm familiar with how it works
2010-11-03T14:48:00  <lavalamp__> it's best to rtfm before you rm -rf anything...
2010-11-03T14:48:10  <Zannick> rtfm -rf
2010-11-03T14:48:40  <Zannick> should be c99, yeah
2010-11-03T14:48:54  <Migi32> if youreally care about not having your code read I'm sure there are obfuscaters out there for your language though
2010-11-03T14:48:59  <Zannick> it's the default in the gcc being used
2010-11-03T14:49:32  <Migi32> unless you're using Lisp, then you don't really need an obfuscater ;)
2010-11-03T14:49:46  <demerzel_> oh whoa wtf inline = static?
2010-11-03T14:49:51  <demerzel_> i didn't know that
2010-11-03T14:49:53  *** TravisD <TravisD!~Adium@uwsclient-152-163.uws.ualberta.ca> has joined #aichallenge
2010-11-03T14:50:06  <lavalamp__> inline most assuredly != static
2010-11-03T14:50:08  <Zannick> um, no
2010-11-03T14:50:56  <Zannick> but you have to have a declaration of the inline function to include it elsewhere, like anything else
2010-11-03T14:51:06  <demerzel_> hmm some article says you have to do this for c89 # define inline static
2010-11-03T14:51:35  <Zannick> for a while i was using static inline functions defined in an h file until i said screw it and moved it into a c file
2010-11-03T14:51:39  <demerzel_> i presumed that meant they were equivalent which was news to me
2010-11-03T14:52:18  <lavalamp__> if anything they are opposite
2010-11-03T14:52:49  <demerzel_> yea that's what i thought
2010-11-03T14:53:04  <demerzel_> i was like uh i thought static meant 1 instance and inline means 'make an instance anywhere it's used'
2010-11-03T14:53:29  <demerzel_> substituting instance for a more appropriate word
2010-11-03T14:54:04  <lavalamp__> yeah that's the idea

2010-11-03T14:55:55  <lavalamp__> I can't imagine why you would do that, either there's some weird C thing or that guy was on something
2010-11-03T14:55:57  <Zannick> static is "no other file can use this"
2010-11-03T14:56:18  <Zannick> inline is "insert this everywhere it's used instead of calling it"
2010-11-03T14:56:25  <Zannick> essentially
2010-11-03T14:56:54  <phreeza> Zannick: thats my understanding of inline, but what do youmean by file in static?
2010-11-03T14:57:17  <demerzel_> that's the meaning of static in front of global variables
2010-11-03T14:57:23  <demerzel_> but i'm talking more static members

2010-11-03T14:57:52  <Error323> here my flaw is my strength
2010-11-03T14:57:54  <phreeza> static members are on a per class basis instead of a per object basis

2010-11-03T14:58:17  <demerzel_> idk why c89 would care about it tho
2010-11-03T14:58:24  <demerzel_> since we're talking c and there are no member funcs
2010-11-03T14:58:30  <Zannick> yeah, i'm thinking only of global variables and functions, wrt c
2010-11-03T14:58:31  <demerzel_> so you're right lol
2010-11-03T14:58:40  <phreeza> ah ok
2010-11-03T14:59:02  <demerzel_> i guess inline in that case would make c89 expand it in only that obj file
2010-11-03T14:59:08  <demerzel_> which essentially would be the same thing'

2010-11-03T15:21:07  <raedwulf> if you have parameters to tweak
2010-11-03T15:21:11  <rabidus> almost everyone over 4k
2010-11-03T15:21:15  <raedwulf> learning could be tweaking those parameters
2010-11-03T15:21:42  <phreeza> true... but i was thinking more explicit learning sonmehow
2010-11-03T15:21:52  <phreeza> like learning from mistakes
2010-11-03T15:21:58  <raedwulf> ah
2010-11-03T15:21:58  <phreeza> case based
2010-11-03T15:22:10  <phreeza> something like that
2010-11-03T15:22:27  <raedwulf> thats more complex
2010-11-03T15:22:32  <Error323> well even if you manage to create sth like that
2010-11-03T15:22:58  <Error323> you would need the tcp server, since the official doesn't allow file writing
2010-11-03T15:23:03  <raedwulf> the trick is to define something useful from a series of states

2010-11-03T15:23:11  <phreeza> yea or use the logs from official
2010-11-03T15:23:44  <raedwulf> afaik, the only things i can think of could easily be calculated
2010-11-03T15:24:13  <raedwulf> and most other things are pretty useless as they depend on the map more than anything

2010-11-03T15:50:56  <boegel> phreeza: I join you in suspecting some exterior cause, and my bot being blamed
2010-11-03T15:51:06  <phreeza> ah ok :)
2010-11-03T15:51:11  <boegel> it should run in like 0.1s per turn
2010-11-03T15:51:15  <phreeza> yea they shouldn't be using wallclock time
2010-11-03T15:53:22  <boegel> they're using wall clock time?
2010-11-03T15:53:24  * boegel gasps
2010-11-03T15:53:34  <boegel> that really doesn't make sense people...
2010-11-03T15:53:36  <phreeza> yeap
2010-11-03T15:53:43  <phreeza> i think so...
2010-11-03T15:54:23  <phreeza> albert told me that was what it seemed like to him
2010-11-03T15:54:48  <phreeza> he has a searching bot andf it was timing out before he changed his abortion criterium to wallclock time
2010-11-03T15:54:49  <janzert> yes, it is wall clock
2010-11-03T15:56:46  <boegel> janzert: any particular reasoning behind using wall clock?
2010-11-03T15:57:39  <janzert> that was done way before I was around (it was the same in the last contest) but I think it's mostly just because it was easiest to do
2010-11-03T15:58:16  <janzert> trying to get accurate cpu time for a child process is not straightforward
2010-11-03T15:58:25  <boegel> hmm
2010-11-03T15:58:44  <boegel> I don't have a cut-n-clear answer for that, I must admit
2010-11-03T15:59:08  <janzert> also of course you *still* must have a wall time limit
2010-11-03T15:59:27  <janzert> so someone can't does the server with something like time.sleep(999)
2010-11-03T15:59:42  <janzert> s/does/dos
2010-11-03T16:00:12  <janzert> the other problem with cpu time is that it doesn't coun't I/O wait time
2010-11-03T16:00:34  <janzert> so a bot that does lots of disk reading would have a relative advantage
2010-11-03T16:01:32  <janzert> heh, my fingers are sticking apostrophes in between all nt pairs
2010-11-03T16:01:43  <Error323> lol
2010-11-03T16:03:55  <Error323> does anyone know where testingfrompiter is at officially?
2010-11-03T16:04:16  * boegel resubmits his bot to see if it occurs again
2010-11-03T16:04:50  <boegel> janzert: why would IO matter? you're not allowed to write to file, right?
2010-11-03T16:05:03  <janzert> not write but you can read
2010-11-03T16:05:11  <janzert> say lot's of precomputed data
2010-11-03T16:06:00  <boegel> janzert: where would you read it from?
2010-11-03T16:06:21  <boegel> janzert: it would have to be embedded in your bot's binary
2010-11-03T16:06:35  <janzert> you can upload data files along with your bot
2010-11-03T16:06:35  <boegel> janzert: and the file size of your submission is limited
2010-11-03T16:06:43  <demerzel_> yup
2010-11-03T16:06:44  <boegel> janzert: I don't think IO would be an issue
2010-11-03T16:07:04  <boegel> janzert: and these will be copied every tine your bot runs somewhere, alongside your binary?
2010-11-03T16:07:09  <janzert> yes
2010-11-03T16:10:41  <Error323> meen

2010-11-03T16:16:45  <boegel> how hard is that nowadays?
2010-11-03T16:18:19  <phreeza> it can probably be done if you put in the time and build a heuristic bot, and iteratively refine it by analyzing mistakes it made
2010-11-03T16:18:23  <Error323> how can we answer that :P
2010-11-03T16:18:49  <boegel> phreeza: that's exactly what I'm doing :)
2010-11-03T16:18:58  <boegel> phreeza: the top bots aren't heuristic?
2010-11-03T16:19:05  <phreeza> i think they all are
2010-11-03T16:19:11  <phreeza> pretty much
2010-11-03T16:19:14  <Error323> then how in the world are you timing out boegel

2010-11-03T18:08:20  <Error323> >_<
2010-11-03T18:08:35  <Migi32> Error323, why are you doing pow(x, 2.0)? Can't you just do x*x?
2010-11-03T18:08:42  <Error323> yes
2010-11-03T18:08:50  <Migi32> just now reading the snippet you posted earlier
2010-11-03T18:08:51  <Error323> you can :P
2010-11-03T18:09:03  <Error323> but it stems from tweaking
2010-11-03T18:09:03  <phreeza> Migi32: thats the first thing i though when i saw the code snippet ;)
2010-11-03T18:09:25  <phreeza> Error323: x*x ist faster,i'm quite sure?
2010-11-03T18:09:26  <Migi32> Error323, ah ok, then I understand :)

2010-11-03T18:09:55  <Migi32> Error323, so after trying a whole bunch of different values 2.0 turned out to be the best? Interesting.
2010-11-03T18:10:03  <phreeza> oh
2010-11-03T18:10:12  <Error323> well
2010-11-03T18:10:13  <phreeza> thats what you mean by tweaking
2010-11-03T18:10:17  <phreeza> i thought speed
2010-11-03T18:10:21  <Error323> given my bot :P
2010-11-03T18:10:34  <Error323> but yeah
2010-11-03T18:11:02  <Migi32> Error323, did you also try values like 1.7 or just integer values?
2010-11-03T18:11:32  <Migi32> because if you did, there may be a mathematical reason why 2.0 is the best
2010-11-03T18:12:16  <Error323> i did a sort of binary search yeah

2010-11-03T18:19:44  <bhasker> which i will do later
2010-11-03T18:19:49  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=842686
2010-11-03T18:19:53  <bhasker> its with how i priortize planets
2010-11-03T18:20:03  <bhasker> stupid thing should have gone for the neutral
2010-11-03T18:20:04  <bhasker> and sniped you
2010-11-03T18:20:12  <Error323> =]
2010-11-03T18:20:13  <bhasker> instead it went for your base planet and got owned
2010-11-03T18:20:19  <Error323> indd
2010-11-03T18:20:37  <bhasker> the reason it did that is i look at enemy/my planets before i look at neutrals
2010-11-03T18:20:58  <Migi32> this one too: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=842690. Biggest reason why you lost it is because you took the 80 before the 30
2010-11-03T18:21:09  <bhasker> well it won't have launched if my shipsRequired function was accounting for neutrals
2010-11-03T18:21:13  <bhasker> correctly
2010-11-03T18:21:47  <bhasker> since it doesn't
2010-11-03T18:21:53  <bhasker> it calculated it had enough ships to take it
2010-11-03T18:22:01  <bhasker> and it launched
2010-11-03T18:22:03  <bhasker> :(
2010-11-03T18:22:15  <bhasker> i haven't figured how to account for ships in flight + neutrals
2010-11-03T18:22:18  <bhasker> which enemy will acquire
2010-11-03T18:22:34  <Error323> i have :D
2010-11-03T18:22:40  <Error323> but i have other issues:p

2010-11-03T20:30:18  <boiserm> inefficiently written python at that, I'm sure
2010-11-03T20:33:37  <demerzel__> the replay strings are super easy to parse
2010-11-03T20:33:58  <demerzel__> going the other way you just list owner,ships: then fleet infos in sequential order

2010-11-03T20:37:51  <boiserm> I'm too tired to mess with it anymore tonight, but thanks for the offer
2010-11-03T20:38:13  <boiserm> 48 games, 36 wins, 12 losses, 4 mysterious crashes/timeouts
2010-11-03T20:38:27  <boiserm> so 1/3 of my losses are a mystery :(

2010-11-03T21:53:48  <demerzel__> one thing that constantly amazes me is how many bugs you can introduce through very simple miscalcs
2010-11-03T22:02:23  <sigh> demerzel__: not as amazing as when fixing those bugs makes the bot worse
2010-11-03T22:05:21  <demerzel__> sigh: my bot can't get much worse atm lol
2010-11-03T22:05:27  <demerzel__> it's tracking them down that's my damn problem atm
2010-11-03T22:06:18  <sigh> if it is reproducible then it is easy... otherwise... good luck

2010-11-03T22:18:13  <Frontier> I used valgrind recently and it tought me a lot about how c++ really works ^^. Still some messages were very obscure.
2010-11-03T22:20:17  <Frontier> I have experimented with an academic problem. Assume all planets sit in one spot and there is no enemy. What is the fastest way to capture them all?
2010-11-03T22:20:59  <demerzel__> i think i may have actually found it lol
2010-11-03T22:21:06  <demerzel__> i can't use valgrind no windows haha
2010-11-03T22:22:10  <Frontier> The bad thing is that itermediate states have multiple qualities. Available own ships and the turn # for example. If there was only one quality I could solve the problem now with ~4.000.000 attack calculations.
2010-11-03T22:23:11  <Frontier> And still that would be two steps away from the game reality: 1. ignoring travel time is bad, 2. no enemy isn't quite representative
2010-11-03T22:24:23  <demerzel__> my bot was about to actually win and crapped out at like turn 120 somehow changing from successfully streaming from 5 planets to trying to launch from 2 haha http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=845431
2010-11-03T22:24:35  <demerzel__> why bot why
2010-11-03T22:36:41  <janzert> any lisp users around?
2010-11-03T22:39:18  <demerzel__> janzert: kick  demerzel_ i have no idea why it's still up i close it like 5 hours ago
2010-11-03T22:39:33  <demerzel__> oh you don't have ops weird haha
2010-11-03T22:40:00  <amstan> demerzel__: you sure?
2010-11-03T22:40:12  <amstan> demerzel__: kicking won't mean he'll disconnect
2010-11-03T22:40:17  <amstan> just means he'll leave this channel
2010-11-03T22:40:22  <demerzel__> oh well nm
2010-11-03T22:40:28  <demerzel__> maybe it's just sitting at my workstation haha
2010-11-03T22:40:40  <amstan> ssh in and kill the irc program
2010-11-03T22:41:38  <demerzel__> hahaha yea my work uses linux
2010-11-03T22:41:43  <demerzel__> they're scared of java
2010-11-03T22:53:35  <sigh> Frontier: no enemy can be a good enough approximation at the start of the game, as long as the planets are not too close
2010-11-03T22:54:23  <sigh> *as long as starting planets are not too close

2010-11-03T23:07:42  <Frontier> sigh: that's right. Maybe I should cut the calculations off after 30 turns into the future or so.
2010-11-03T23:08:47  <sigh> Frontier: it's worth trying... although I'm skeptical that ignoring travel time will give you any meaningful result
2010-11-03T23:10:42  <Frontier> sigh: ... yeah its not worth trying. + the importance of planets that are the same distance from both players cant be ignored. maybe i find another use for that algorithm somewhere else

2010-11-03T23:16:17  <sigh> hmmm... it seems I've asked you this before
2010-11-03T23:16:28  <sigh> ok, your name is Frontier in the main contest
2010-11-03T23:17:06  <sigh> I wish we could search users by username :(
2010-11-03T23:22:50  <Frontier> That would be a long missing feature. I haven't uploaded anything in ages. Im on rank 241 now.
2010-11-03T23:23:37  <demerzel__> i'm down to like 3-400 hehe
2010-11-03T23:24:07  <demerzel__> when i put it up it was 2 weeks old even cuz of that c# compiling problem
2010-11-03T23:25:04  * janzert idly wonders about adding a simple test for bots to past before they are entered in the contest, basically just that they reply with a valid order after being given an initial map
2010-11-03T23:25:35  <janzert> mostly just to help catch all the fatal errors in non-compiled languages
2010-11-03T23:25:38  <demerzel__> i would just say invalid orders disqualify you
2010-11-03T23:25:50  <demerzel__> timing out is an issue that some people can't avoid
2010-11-03T23:26:22  <janzert> if someone issues an invalid order once in a great while it's not really that big a deal either
2010-11-03T23:28:42  <sigh> ideally the starter packs would have included code to check for invalid moves
2010-11-03T23:28:57  <demerzel__> they don't?
2010-11-03T23:29:05  <demerzel__> damn i thought they did
2010-11-03T23:29:10  <sigh> I mean the bots, not the engine

2010-11-03T23:30:29  <lavalamp_> I have code to crash instead of issuing an invalid order... :/
2010-11-03T23:31:11  <sigh> as long as it is visible... I just log to an error file locally, ignore silently on the main server
2010-11-03T23:34:45  <demerzel__> i have no error handling because i'm in pure C atm haha
2010-11-03T23:34:55  <demerzel__> i did just have a try/catch/finally that sent go in C#
2010-11-03T23:44:30  <sigh> @predict
2010-11-03T23:44:30  <contestbot> I predict that Azrathud will win!
2010-11-03T23:45:09  <demerzel__> impressive it managed to spit out 20350 orders in under a second
2010-11-03T23:45:13  <demerzel__> all the same unfortunately
2010-11-03T23:56:46  <antimatroid> sigh: are you still using checks for invalid moves?
2010-11-03T23:56:56  <antimatroid> i've taken them out for the  moment, otherwise you don't always see bugs
2010-11-03T23:57:27  <sigh> antimatroid: I have the checks, but I also log an error
2010-11-03T23:57:40  <sigh> the only time it is silent is on the main server
2010-11-03T23:57:59  <antimatroid> yeah okay, I just let it go without checks atm
2010-11-03T23:58:06  <antimatroid> i think i have it right so that it doesn't crash
2010-11-03T23:58:16  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm off to do something about lunch
