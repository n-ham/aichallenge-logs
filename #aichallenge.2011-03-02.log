2011-03-02T00:00:30  <janzert> then you'll need to replace the 50 on line 228 with min(50, len(total_ranking))
2011-03-02T00:00:35  <McLeopold> okay, now my maps list is empty :)
2011-03-02T00:00:59  <janzert> err, min(50, len(total_ranking)-1) actually
2011-03-02T00:01:16  <janzert> or is it -2 :P
2011-03-02T00:01:51  <amstan> you guys working on https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues#issue/7 ?
2011-03-02T00:01:55  <janzert> yeah, min(50, len(total_ranking) - 2)
2011-03-02T00:02:18  <janzert> I think we're just working on getting McLeopold a working setup
2011-03-02T00:02:48  <amstan> website & db? or the cronjobs too?
2011-03-02T00:03:11  <janzert> well, the end to end running of games
2011-03-02T00:03:31  <janzert> no idea if he's sticking it in cronjobs eventually or just running the stuff manually
2011-03-02T00:03:35  <McLeopold> woot, I got a match
2011-03-02T00:03:41  <janzert> yay :)
2011-03-02T00:03:53  <McLeopold> I'm playing so I understand everything.
2011-03-02T00:04:12  <McLeopold> so, is the dispatch time used as a locking mechanism?
2011-03-02T00:04:45  <amstan> ups, there's a problem with this
2011-03-02T00:04:53  <janzert> more or less
2011-03-02T00:05:23  <janzert> it will redispatch a game if it doesn't get turned in after a certain amount of time
2011-03-02T00:05:33  <amstan> janzert: i'm just wondering about this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commit/234f0a6f3466f7355b4d119c499d46656e3c1d85
2011-03-02T00:05:34  <janzert> on the assumption that the worker died
2011-03-02T00:05:41  <amstan> janzert: what's the stuff at line 187
2011-03-02T00:05:44  <McLeopold> I also had to put in a fake leaderboard number

2011-03-02T00:07:44  <amstan> janzert: yes
2011-03-02T00:07:55  <janzert> Oh I see
2011-03-02T00:07:59  <amstan> janzert: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/commits/234f0a6f3466f7355b4d119c499d46656e3c1d85/planet_wars/www/profile.php
2011-03-02T00:08:33  <janzert> for the last few hours of the finals we didn't display rank updates
2011-03-02T00:09:02  <janzert> at first I just hid the rank in the users profile, this was a change to show the frozen rank instead of outright hiding it
2011-03-02T00:09:55  <janzert> the leaderboards were actually still being generated in the background but we just displayed that particular one instead of the most recent one
2011-03-02T00:10:26  <amstan> yeah, ok
2011-03-02T00:10:50  <janzert> if you look at the previous commit you'll see that was when that line was commented out
2011-03-02T00:11:09  <McLeopold> where is a list of submission status codes?
2011-03-02T00:11:22  <janzert> one of the php files

2011-03-02T00:11:42  <janzert> I think submission.php? (if that is actually a real file)
2011-03-02T00:12:17  <janzert> yep, comment at the top of submission.php
2011-03-02T00:13:30  <McLeopold> so, I've got status 70, error while compiling
2011-03-02T00:13:30  <janzert> but it would be good if it was changed so all errors were strictly larger than all in progress codes
2011-03-02T00:14:06  <janzert> having error 30 less than success 40 was an added complexity in several spots
2011-03-02T00:15:39  <janzert> 70 would have been set by compile_daemon.py
2011-03-02T00:16:00  <McLeopold> you'd think my matchup wouldn't have been created then...
2011-03-02T00:16:28  <McLeopold> does compile_daemon log anywhere?
2011-03-02T00:16:44  <janzert> yep, it should be in compile.log
2011-03-02T00:17:17  <McLeopold> which would be where?
2011-03-02T00:17:30  <janzert> the directory you ran it from I believe
2011-03-02T00:17:50  <McLeopold> unable to locate submission directory

2011-03-02T00:20:38  <amstan> i defroze the leaderboards
2011-03-02T00:20:59  <janzert> otherwise make sure your server_info["submissions_path"] has the trailing /
2011-03-02T00:24:21  <antimatroid> yikes, talk much :P
2011-03-02T00:25:47  <McLeopold> janzert: you got it, that was my problem
2011-03-02T00:26:08  <McLeopold> plus a missing directory
2011-03-02T00:27:17  <janzert> I don't understand why the submission was marked as latest in the database for the pairing script to pick up though
2011-03-02T00:28:16  <McLeopold> I hacked it
2011-03-02T00:28:33  <janzert> ahh :P
2011-03-02T00:31:44  <McLeopold> okay, now we need to add unzip to the server install list
2011-03-02T00:43:41  <McLeopold> and python-simplejson
2011-03-02T00:44:54  <McLeopold> janzert: if my worker is setup, I just need to run tournament_manager.sh?
2011-03-02T00:45:39  <janzert> for testing that should be fine yeah
2011-03-02T00:45:45  <McLeopold> amstan: it looks like worker needed compile_anything?
2011-03-02T00:45:58  <janzert> err, tournament_manager.py
2011-03-02T00:46:05  <McLeopold> why not sh?
2011-03-02T00:46:20  <McLeopold> oh...
2011-03-02T00:46:22  <janzert> ahh, I guess tournament_manager.sh is fine as well
2011-03-02T00:46:29  <McLeopold> that's why it took 45 seconds...
2011-03-02T00:46:30  <janzert> but that should really be deleted
2011-03-02T00:46:35  <janzert> I missed that in the cleanup
2011-03-02T00:47:25  <McLeopold> should compile_anything only be in the worker, or both?
2011-03-02T00:47:39  <janzert> just in the manager right now
2011-03-02T00:47:48  <McLeopold> the worker errors out
2011-03-02T00:47:53  <McLeopold> so it does need it
2011-03-02T00:47:54  <janzert> oh shoot
2011-03-02T00:47:57  <janzert> that's right it does
2011-03-02T00:48:01  <antimatroid> McLeopold: can we not let people keep their old ranking on a resubmit, not even for their first pairing?
2011-03-02T00:48:03  <McLeopold> so both?
2011-03-02T00:48:08  <janzert> yes
2011-03-02T00:48:22  <antimatroid> i think that worked badly last time, particularly for people who submitted a lot (aesvis and bix0r i think)
2011-03-02T00:48:32  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes, that's what will happen
2011-03-02T00:48:49  <antimatroid> above it was said they might get paired near their old ranking?
2011-03-02T00:48:51  <McLeopold> we will fix the leaderboard display, not the matching logic
2011-03-02T00:49:45  <McLeopold> antimatroid: but remember, TrueSkill is very different from bayeselo.
2011-03-02T00:50:42  <McLeopold> crap, now I need apikeys
2011-03-02T00:50:44  <antimatroid> it still meant people near the top didn't really play bottom ranked bots until the final tournament
2011-03-02T00:50:49  <antimatroid> where there were a few surprise
2011-03-02T00:51:03  <McLeopold> oh, I see
2011-03-02T00:51:27  <McLeopold> they had some bad losses against simple bots they weren't prepared for?
2011-03-02T00:51:28  <antimatroid> i think it'd be better to make people climb back up every time they resubmit
2011-03-02T00:51:32  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-02T00:51:44  <antimatroid> while that is there own fault, i think it could be avoided
2011-03-02T00:51:54  <McLeopold> you still won't get a match against the low guys if you beat the middle
2011-03-02T00:52:11  <antimatroid> yeah that's fine, bix0r was resubmitting and just staying in the top 30 or so
2011-03-02T00:52:34  <McLeopold> he was on tcp alot, he should have see something
2011-03-02T00:52:47  <antimatroid> who was he on tcp?
2011-03-02T00:52:56  <McLeopold> bix0r
2011-03-02T00:53:05  <antimatroid> i don't remember seeing that :\
2011-03-02T00:53:12  <McLeopold> Icould be wrong...
2011-03-02T00:53:23  <antimatroid> so could i :)

2011-03-02T00:54:00  <McLeopold> janzert: what should api_base_url be?
2011-03-02T00:54:01  <janzert> anyone know if the go programming language has real release bundles we can download instead of pulling from their mercurial repository?
2011-03-02T00:54:21  <janzert> pretty sure the url to the main server
2011-03-02T00:54:45  <janzert> i.e. for the real thing http://ai-contest.com/
2011-03-02T00:55:23  <janzert> basically where it should find the api_*.php pages at
2011-03-02T01:00:16  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-02T01:02:07  <McLeopold> janzert: ensure_submission_is_local is failing on me
2011-03-02T01:02:53  <antimatroid> i'm with janzert, i found self playing an awesome performance measure in pw
2011-03-02T01:03:00  <antimatroid> a terrible*******
2011-03-02T01:03:40  <janzert> McLeopold: remind me where that's found, then tell me what the error is :)
2011-03-02T01:04:02  <janzert> I found it
2011-03-02T01:04:07  <McLeopold> line 65
2011-03-02T01:04:13  <McLeopold> no such file or directory
2011-03-02T01:04:16  <McLeopold> permissions?
2011-03-02T01:04:24  <McLeopold> do I need to run it from somewhere?
2011-03-02T01:04:36  <antimatroid> i'm with jmcarthur about the tron graphs too, we need those back, and leaderboards for countries/organizations
2011-03-02T01:05:00  <McLeopold> antimatroid: what about the terrible thing?  I didn't quite follow
2011-03-02T01:05:05  <janzert> it expects the submissions directory to be in the parent of the worker directory and it needs write permission in that directory
2011-03-02T01:05:18  <antimatroid> testing against your own bots was a terrible performance measure
2011-03-02T01:05:28  <janzert> and needs to be run from the worker directory
2011-03-02T01:05:52  <McLeopold> janzert: okay, I try and fix that...
2011-03-02T01:06:00  <janzert> or you could change the dir="" to the server_info["..."]
2011-03-02T01:06:06  <McLeopold> should just pull from server_info
2011-03-02T01:06:25  <janzert> yep, it's just another spot that the path was hard coded before
2011-03-02T01:07:32  <janzert> so is there a way to get git to download just the worker directory?
2011-03-02T01:08:39  <McLeopold> line 86, an os.chdir to backend?
2011-03-02T01:09:06  <McLeopold> janzert: I think the answer is no, I looked it up once
2011-03-02T01:09:50  <janzert> oh, that should chdir back to the original directory
2011-03-02T01:10:05  <janzert> which before was always ../../backend
2011-03-02T01:10:09  <McLeopold> http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-read-tree.html#_sparse_checkout
2011-03-02T01:10:47  <McLeopold> a submodule might be more appropriate?
2011-03-02T01:10:53  <janzert> thanks
2011-03-02T01:11:22  <janzert> actually I'm working on replacing the svn checkout of the worker code for the worker setup script
2011-03-02T01:11:58  <janzert> seems like I'll need to do something a little different
2011-03-02T01:13:28  <antimatroid> hmmm, if we did graphs, would the be your position over time or your relative level compared to hunter bot?
2011-03-02T01:13:58  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I suggest 3 numbers: rank, skill, hunterbot index
2011-03-02T01:14:00  <antimatroid> it would be nice to smooth it over relative to hunter bot (like average every day then interpret the linear line
2011-03-02T01:14:01  <janzert> percentile over time
2011-03-02T01:14:33  <antimatroid> smoothing would be to try and remove the jumps at resubmit time
2011-03-02T01:14:43  <McLeopold> different people will want different numbers, so we will give what they want
2011-03-02T01:14:53  <McLeopold> there's no use trying to jam all info into 1 number
2011-03-02T01:14:55  <antimatroid> percentile over time would really point out danielVF's point
2011-03-02T01:15:19  <antimatroid> actually, maybe not

2011-03-02T01:15:45  <McLeopold> also, the graph over time would have different lines for different submissions
2011-03-02T01:16:01  <antimatroid> McLeopold: sure, or you could smooth it :P

2011-03-02T01:16:35  <amstan> you guys should contact that guy, ask him how he made the original one
2011-03-02T01:16:49  <McLeopold> I need to remember to say something stupid just before I leave IRC from now on...
2011-03-02T01:17:10  * antimatroid just doesn't leave
2011-03-02T01:17:25  <amstan> McLeopold: yeah, you should get a server+ssh+screen+irssi going

2011-03-02T01:19:01  <amstan> but who am i kidding, i do the same as McLeopold
2011-03-02T01:19:19  <jmcarthur> my favorite one of those:
2011-03-02T01:19:21  <jmcarthur> "mmorrow was last seen on #ghc 1 year, 43 days, 3 hours, 21 minutes and 32 seconds ago, saying: * mmorrow is rtfm'ing"
2011-03-02T01:19:43  <jmcarthur> it's a long manual
2011-03-02T01:20:57  <DanielVF> lol
2011-03-02T01:20:58  <jmcarthur> man, i just flipped my code on its head. made a major structural change, cleaned up type errors all over the place, and now it just works...
2011-03-02T01:21:14  <jmcarthur> which always kind of worries me a little bit
2011-03-02T01:21:23  <McLeopold> DanielVF!
2011-03-02T01:21:31  <DanielVF> Greets!
2011-03-02T01:21:54  <McLeopold> so, you gonna help out with the launch?
2011-03-02T01:22:14  <DanielVF> No, too busy.
2011-03-02T01:22:34  <McLeopold> too bad
2011-03-02T01:22:36  <DanielVF> I'm just going to be on the sidelines and make comments about the way the rest of you should be doing things. :P
2011-03-02T01:23:01  <janzert> hey, that's what I've been doing
2011-03-02T01:23:06  <DanielVF> haha
2011-03-02T01:23:09  <janzert> guess I can share space on the bench here
2011-03-02T01:23:25  <amstan> janzert: i don't remember buying a bench
2011-03-02T01:23:28  <McLeopold> so, this chdir-ing in the tournament manager makes me nervous
2011-03-02T01:23:34  <DanielVF> I am just on the edge of getting sucked into writing code though.
2011-03-02T01:23:44  <McLeopold> a starter bot?
2011-03-02T01:23:48  <janzert> in what way?
2011-03-02T01:24:03  <amstan> star!ter!bot! star!ter!bot!
2011-03-02T01:24:23  <janzert> it's certainly not secure, but we are compiling submissions on the main server as the contest user too so...
2011-03-02T01:25:03  <DanielVF> Ptrace works for everything but java right?
2011-03-02T01:25:04  <janzert> that's something I hope can be fixed before the contest starts, move all compilation to the workers and make it sandboxed
2011-03-02T01:25:35  <McLeopold> janzert: i don't think I need to chdir back to worker anymore?
2011-03-02T01:25:44  <McLeopold> if I'm using server_info?
2011-03-02T01:25:47  <DanielVF> Can't we just use ptrace sandboxing for non-java, and use java's built in security for java apps?
2011-03-02T01:26:01  * Frontier wonders if there is any language in the world that can instruct the compiler to execute sql statements or delete files
2011-03-02T01:26:15  <janzert> I think it would be best, so you're executing in a known directory
2011-03-02T01:26:23  <antimatroid> DanielVF: it's good being able to ping you and janzert :)
2011-03-02T01:26:33  <amstan> Frontier: i think haskell and cl do this
2011-03-02T01:26:46  <amstan> jmcarthur: ^
2011-03-02T01:26:49  <janzert> and if you somehow write a file it isn't written in some poor submissions directory
2011-03-02T01:27:11  <McLeopold> like if the code throws a temper?
2011-03-02T01:27:13  <amstan> DanielVF: idk, maybe we can
2011-03-02T01:27:27  <janzert> just save the pwd directory before the first chdir and then chdir back to it afterwards
2011-03-02T01:27:29  <amstan> DanielVF: jeff's pretty confident of the current sandbox though
2011-03-02T01:28:38  <janzert> i.e. save os.getcwd() before and then os.chdir back to it
2011-03-02T01:29:02  <jmcarthur> Frontier: i actually demoed that near the beginning of the planet wars contest
2011-03-02T01:29:41  <jmcarthur> Frontier: had it create a new file in the directory with all the other bots
2011-03-02T01:29:48  <McLeopold> crap, now maps is hard coded...
2011-03-02T01:29:51  <jmcarthur> was fixable in that particular case
2011-03-02T01:29:58  <jmcarthur> but i think there are other ways around it
2011-03-02T01:29:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: ?
2011-03-02T01:30:13  <janzert> :) yes I suspect you'll keep running into hardcoded paths for a while yet
2011-03-02T01:30:15  <McLeopold> antimaroid: the map dir in tournament_manager.py
2011-03-02T01:31:19  <DanielVF> amstan: Ah. I didn't know there was a new one.
2011-03-02T01:31:31  <DanielVF> will have to go see
2011-03-02T01:31:44  <amstan> DanielVF: it's just chmodding and doing some other fun stuff
2011-03-02T01:31:56  <DanielVF> ah.
2011-03-02T01:32:26  <amstan> contestbot: later tell j3camero please update https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Sandboxing with our current sandbox
2011-03-02T01:32:26  <contestbot> amstan: I come to serve.
2011-03-02T01:33:20  <janzert> current sandbox could/should certainly be improved
2011-03-02T01:34:06  <amstan> janzert: can you record some of the issues?
2011-03-02T01:34:26  <pyro-> am i correct in assuming that ants owned by oneself are given as owned by 0?

2011-03-02T01:35:48  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@lithium.mailguard.com.au> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2011-03-02T01:37:33  <amstan> Frontier: i get script error. source line 0 in chrome: http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/aichallenge/ants/www/visualizer/offline.html
2011-03-02T01:37:51  <janzert> amstan: the biggest first thing is that it leaves stuff in the jail user home directory from previous bot runs (any .dot files/directories), but overall it works on a blacklist principle of trying to block all the bad stuff instead of a whitelist of things the bot is allowed to access/do
2011-03-02T01:40:24  <McLeopold> janzert: add_maps_to_database looks like a silly script
2011-03-02T01:41:25  <McLeopold> did we delete the planetwars mapgen?
2011-03-02T01:41:54  <janzert> it's in the manager
2011-03-02T01:42:09  <amstan> McLeopold: maybe, it should be deleted though
2011-03-02T01:42:15  <McLeopold> not yet
2011-03-02T01:42:25  <McLeopold> it should be pulled into a planetwars folder
2011-03-02T01:42:34  <janzert> also the manager add_maps_to_database.py is a little better
2011-03-02T01:42:51  <McLeopold> I would assume we can delete the one in worker
2011-03-02T01:42:58  <janzert> I'm not sure why the worker one didn't get updated
2011-03-02T01:43:09  <janzert> well, you'll need one on the worker
2011-03-02T01:43:25  <janzert> or do you
2011-03-02T01:43:29  <McLeopold> why? does a worker have it's own database?
2011-03-02T01:43:33  <janzert> yes
2011-03-02T01:43:39  <McLeopold> O_o
2011-03-02T01:43:47  <amstan> O_o
2011-03-02T01:43:54  <McLeopold> what the hell for?
2011-03-02T01:43:59  <janzert> it definitely uses the database to track what jail_users are in use
2011-03-02T01:44:10  <janzert> I'm not sure if it uses it to look up maps or not
2011-03-02T01:44:15  <McLeopold> I thought that was all api.php stuff?
2011-03-02T01:44:53  <antimatroid> Frontier: when a player gets a positive score and an enemy has 0, thir colour completely disappears on the score line
2011-03-02T01:45:05  <janzert> so it doesn't need the maps added to the database on the worker
2011-03-02T01:45:19  <janzert> that would explain why the script is outdated there too
2011-03-02T01:45:39  <McLeopold> I don't see sql code in tournement manager
2011-03-02T01:45:42  <Frontier> antimatroid: what is bad about that? :)
2011-03-02T01:45:52  <janzert> it's in user_sadbox.py
2011-03-02T01:45:53  <antimatroid> you can no longer see their score of 0
2011-03-02T01:46:05  <antimatroid> and the right one (yellow) seems to be broken in my chrome
2011-03-02T01:46:06  <Frontier> amstan: What is the error? I have 5 browser windows open and cannot reproduce it
2011-03-02T01:46:17  <antimatroid> it's not showing any score and takes half after red gets a point
2011-03-02T01:46:41  <McLeopold> janzert: how about an api_get_jail_user.php?
2011-03-02T01:46:48  <janzert> you can't
2011-03-02T01:46:53  <janzert> it's worker specific
2011-03-02T01:47:02  <antimatroid> same happens with blues number of ants actually
2011-03-02T01:47:02  <DanielVF> We should nix all that choas
2011-03-02T01:47:13  <janzert> it's locking the jail user on that worker
2011-03-02T01:47:15  <Frontier> antimatroid: Ok, I should drop the bar ^^ - for the scores and just display them somewhere else
2011-03-02T01:47:16  <McLeopold> okay, so, how about a pickle file?
2011-03-02T01:47:22  <DanielVF> and just assign each tournament manager four jail users on startup
2011-03-02T01:47:25  <amstan> Frontier: first thing when i load the page: http://home.hypertriangle.com/~alex/error.png
2011-03-02T01:47:43  <antimatroid> Frontier: maybe put the scores next to the names at hte top?
2011-03-02T01:48:02  <janzert> I don't think pickles are guaranteed to lock correctly if written to concurrently
2011-03-02T01:48:04  <antimatroid> that went badly with pw when it went onto two lines
2011-03-02T01:48:14  <McLeopold> if you just need simple locking, a database is overkill
2011-03-02T01:48:21  <janzert> I would think it would actually just corrupt it
2011-03-02T01:48:25  <Frontier> my lines wont go on two lines, they will scroll
2011-03-02T01:48:30  <janzert> yeah
2011-03-02T01:48:31  <amstan> Frontier: and after.. i click load text below, then i see a very short game happen, then i click rewind.. nothing happens
2011-03-02T01:48:45  <DanielVF> You don't even need locking if you just give a tm the users to use on startup
2011-03-02T01:48:50  <McLeopold> but, at least it isn't really doing much other than jail user management
2011-03-02T01:49:15  <McLeopold> DanielVF: would that be a performance issue, creating users each time?
2011-03-02T01:49:31  <DanielVF> No, you don't create them over and over
2011-03-02T01:49:37  <janzert> don't create them each time, just remember which ones you've handed out
2011-03-02T01:49:38  <DanielVF> just use them over and over
2011-03-02T01:49:46  <Frontier> amstan, I can call the visualizer from your server. what is your chrome version?
2011-03-02T01:49:53  <janzert> so long as you only have one process running tm's
2011-03-02T01:49:59  <antimatroid> Frontier: http://img218.imageshack.us/i/viz.png/
2011-03-02T01:50:08  <amstan> Frontier: cromium 11.0.677.0 (75483) Ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-02T01:50:09  <DanielVF> last tournament we had two tm's running games on each server
2011-03-02T01:50:11  <antimatroid> my "right most" bars don't display properly in chrome
2011-03-02T01:50:30  <DanielVF> just give user1,user2,user3,and user4 to the first one
2011-03-02T01:50:30  <McLeopold> for 575 seconds?
2011-03-02T01:50:43  <DanielVF> and user5...etcs to the second one
2011-03-02T01:50:51  <DanielVF> no need for locking or anything
2011-03-02T01:50:53  <amstan> Frontier: just a note, http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=9559558 is really slow for me lately
2011-03-02T01:51:07  * DanielVF heading to sleep again - new kid finished eating.
2011-03-02T01:52:47  <Frontier> amstan: Chromium 11 ?? Why does mine say 9?
2011-03-02T01:53:14  <Frontier> Ah probably because 11 is unstable :p
2011-03-02T01:54:10  <amstan> apparently i have chromium-daily ppa
2011-03-02T01:54:17  <amstan> updating..
2011-03-02T01:54:26  <Frontier> downdate plz :)
2011-03-02T01:54:39  <amstan> that would be harder, i think
2011-03-02T01:54:45  <Frontier> I'm sure with a stable release it will work
2011-03-02T01:55:04  <amstan> hold on, i haven't updated in a week or so, it might work now
2011-03-02T01:55:04  <Frontier> 11 is hard masked in Gentoo
2011-03-02T01:55:41  <amstan> yay! old visualizer is fast again
2011-03-02T01:55:57  <McLeopold> sweet! a gentoo fan
2011-03-02T01:56:30  <McLeopold> janzert/amstan: so is the sandbox stuff in the worker dir the current stuff?
2011-03-02T01:56:32  <amstan> Frontier: still the same error on load of your script, but now everything seems to work
2011-03-02T01:56:44  <janzert> McLeopold: yes
2011-03-02T01:56:45  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, current as of  pw
2011-03-02T01:57:05  <McLeopold> I thought jeff had a newer sadbox, than pw
2011-03-02T01:57:40  <janzert> hmm, I remember he was playing with it at one time but I never saw a result
2011-03-02T01:58:14  <amstan> McLeopold, janzert: he was playing with VMs, but they're too slow for our use
2011-03-02T01:58:42  <janzert> heh, especially if we're going to stay on ec2
2011-03-02T01:58:54  <janzert> a vm on top of a vm
2011-03-02T02:00:59  <Frontier> amstan: You could remove the last lines in visualizer.js where it sets up the error handler and check again. Also look at the JavaScript error console. Any hint would help. Where is line 0 anyway?
2011-03-02T02:01:20  <McLeopold> janzert: the map name comes through the api_get_matchup.php, so no map database entries on worker
2011-03-02T02:01:29  <McLeopold> just the files
2011-03-02T02:01:39  <McLeopold> And we can get rid of sql use on workers
2011-03-02T02:01:43  <janzert> right, I thought I said I had found that
2011-03-02T02:01:49  <McLeopold> I missed it
2011-03-02T02:02:09  <McLeopold> amstan is spamming us with beta browser issues
2011-03-02T02:02:13  <janzert> :)
2011-03-02T02:02:28  <amstan> Frontier: can you remind me where i can find that?
2011-03-02T02:02:38  <Frontier> Ctrl+Shift+J
2011-03-02T02:02:57  <amstan> Frontier: that opens the downloads window..
2011-03-02T02:03:00  <Frontier> the file is in ants/www/visualizer/js/visualizer.js
2011-03-02T02:03:21  <Frontier> they changed the hotkeys? -.-
2011-03-02T02:04:05  <Frontier> menu->tools->developer console?
2011-03-02T02:04:07  <amstan> Frontier: anyway.. the last 3 lines seem to be the problem
2011-03-02T02:04:18  <amstan> Frontier: commenting them makes the error dissapear
2011-03-02T02:04:39  <Frontier> not really, they merely display an error that would have disapeared in the console
2011-03-02T02:04:52  <Frontier> if the implementation has no bugs
2011-03-02T02:05:44  <Frontier> But if there are no side effects, I'm fine with it, too... damn beta versions
2011-03-02T02:06:52  <amstan> Frontier: ok.. i give up, i think dev console is broken..
2011-03-02T02:07:24  <amstan> Frontier: so... idk why i'm running such a version, it was probably me in a hurry trying to get a ppa link for chromium when i installed
2011-03-02T02:09:14  * Frontier hopes that IE 9 gets out of this state before the contest begins. excanvas is a crutch.
2011-03-02T02:09:52  <pyro-> antimatroid can you explain to me from where comes rows−abs(a.row−b.row) when calculating distance
2011-03-02T02:10:33  <McLeopold> tournament manager fails if there are no matchups...
2011-03-02T02:11:00  <antimatroid> pyro-: it's because the edges of the grid are wrapped
2011-03-02T02:11:43  <janzert> McLeopold: in the full setup that was fine because it would be restarted after 5 seconds
2011-03-02T02:11:56  <pyro-> when computing it in C++ will you translate this formula directly or you know a faster method?
2011-03-02T02:12:02  <antimatroid> you will notice getLocation is a bit rank too, depending on how the language deals with -x%n, you need to translate it too
2011-03-02T02:12:19  <janzert> i.e. it was run from tournament_manager_runner.sh
2011-03-02T02:12:31  <antimatroid> pyro-: what do you mean?
2011-03-02T02:12:38  <McLeopold> janzert: maybe it should just wait a little and try again
2011-03-02T02:12:55  <janzert> that would be fine too
2011-03-02T02:13:11  <janzert> tjat's effectively what it did
2011-03-02T02:13:13  <pyro-> i don't actually have any ideas but from looking at how complectaed it is i wonder if theres a faster method of computing the same result
2011-03-02T02:13:20  <antimatroid> you could calculate abs(a.row-b.row) first, but it was more lines
2011-03-02T02:13:24  <pyro-> than making calls to abs and min and stuff
2011-03-02T02:13:41  <antimatroid> you need min once and abs once, i do abs twice
2011-03-02T02:13:46  <McLeopold> you do need to calculate 2 values and compare
2011-03-02T02:13:59  <pyro-> okay. ty
2011-03-02T02:14:18  <antimatroid> np
2011-03-02T02:15:29  <McLeopold> you could calc the distance, and if it was > half, then recalc?
2011-03-02T02:15:47  <antimatroid> a bit messy
2011-03-02T02:15:55  <McLeopold> yeah, but could be faster
2011-03-02T02:16:43  <antimatroid> i'm going to try storing distances to just outside the field of view from each square later, but i have no idea if it'll be feasible
2011-03-02T02:16:58  <antimatroid> and then just use the startup time to generate them
2011-03-02T02:18:56  <McLeopold> janzert: I actually got a game to play on my server now
2011-03-02T02:19:11  <McLeopold> but, I can't look at it.  "replay can't be parsed"

2011-03-02T02:23:18  <McLeopold> ?
2011-03-02T02:23:21  <McLeopold> you need something?

2011-03-02T02:24:09  <Frontier> McLeopold: If I had a good replay file I could check some things: the parser and the performance
2011-03-02T02:24:31  <McLeopold> I actually haven't written the stuff to not send food each turn.
2011-03-02T02:24:45  <Frontier> Ok, I'll wait for the changes.

2011-03-02T02:26:39  <McLeopold> janzert: so, did you only use tournament_manager_runner.sh?
2011-03-02T02:31:31  <janzert> no, start_worker.sh is what is run at worker boot up
2011-03-02T02:31:49  <janzert> it runs two tournament_manager_runners
2011-03-02T02:31:50  <McLeopold> so, tournament_*_runner can be deleted?
2011-03-02T02:31:59  <janzert> nope

2011-03-02T02:33:50  <McLeopold> multi-user is going to be a headache to code for...
2011-03-02T02:33:51  <CIA-89> aichallenge: McLeopold epsilon * r8bb5529 / (20 files in 9 dirs): Merge branch 'epsilon' of https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge into epsilon - http://bit.ly/h2JttT
2011-03-02T02:33:59  <McLeopold> lots of changes to tournament manager
2011-03-02T02:34:48  <janzert> yeah, also maybe keep in mind that the match queue should be turned into a job queue and have compilation jobs added to it
2011-03-02T02:34:55  <McLeopold> crap, can we use some exports instead of hard coded shell script paths?
2011-03-02T02:35:26  <McLeopold> I'm not touching that change with a ten foot pole.
2011-03-02T02:35:58  <janzert> but it should be easier than the multi-user change you're already doing :)
2011-03-02T02:36:15  <janzert> and will be even easier if it's kept in mind while you're doing it
2011-03-02T02:36:21  <McLeopold> actually, part of the matching data could be a flag that says "not compiled yet"?
2011-03-02T02:36:42  <McLeopold> or do you want a compile verified outside of a match?
2011-03-02T02:36:56  <janzert> yeah, I think they should be separate
2011-03-02T02:37:22  <janzert> also prioritized so they are handed out ahead of matches
2011-03-02T02:37:23  <McLeopold> so, a generic, "get_work" function
2011-03-02T02:37:29  <janzert> yes
2011-03-02T02:37:49  <McLeopold> does the compiled stuff need to be sent back to the main server then?
2011-03-02T02:38:03  <janzert> no, just a report of success or error
2011-03-02T02:38:17  <McLeopold> so, when a worker needs the compiled file?
2011-03-02T02:38:47  <janzert> everything should just be compiled on the worker that needs it
2011-03-02T02:39:06  <McLeopold> so each worker needs to compile the same submission for itself?
2011-03-02T02:39:08  <janzert> handing around the compiled version doesn't really save much in the long run
2011-03-02T02:39:16  <janzert> yes
2011-03-02T02:39:53  <McLeopold> that might suck if different workers have different hardware
2011-03-02T02:39:58  <janzert> after a worker has been up for an hour or so it had pretty much all the submissions local anyway and just had the new ones to add as they came in
2011-03-02T02:40:05  <McLeopold> you'd have bots that run on some, but not others, maybe

2011-03-02T02:40:28  <janzert> yeah, but that isn't any different if you compile everything locally or not
2011-03-02T02:40:33  <McLeopold> ture
2011-03-02T02:40:43  <janzert> all workers need to match
2011-03-02T02:42:09  <McLeopold> okay, time for bed, thx for the help
2011-03-02T02:42:32  <janzert> yeah, about time for me to go as well
2011-03-02T02:42:46  <janzert> I've got about half the worker build script working again :/

2011-03-02T07:23:21  <aerique> from the spec it isn't quite clear to me when the map is sent to a bot
2011-03-02T07:24:19  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2011-03-02T07:25:09  <antimatroid1> have you looked at the sample input?
2011-03-02T07:27:14  <antimatroid1> aerique: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/bots/cpp my bot is there too if you want an example
2011-03-02T07:27:26  <aerique> antimatroid1: yes, if you check https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification there's a chapter "Maps" and an example map.  is that never sent to a bot?  just the sample input?
2011-03-02T07:27:43  <antimatroid1> aerique: a bot never receives a char map
2011-03-02T07:27:55  <aerique> antimatroid1: alright, that's clear
2011-03-02T07:28:00  <antimatroid1> only information each turn about squares one of their live ants can currently see
2011-03-02T07:28:06  <aerique> thanks :)
2011-03-02T07:28:18  <antimatroid1> and you only get water information once, so don't wipe that
2011-03-02T07:28:31  <antimatroid1> you never get land information then everything else repeats
2011-03-02T07:28:51  <antimatroid1> except dead ants just show up once if visible when they die, just treat those as land in the starter pack
2011-03-02T07:30:15  <aerique> right, i got it now

2011-03-02T10:37:08  <janzert> mostly I'm wondering if a scala user would consider 2.7.7 ancient :)
2011-03-02T10:37:16  <janzert> I assume they probably would
2011-03-02T10:38:55  <jmcarthur> oh i have no idea
2011-03-02T10:39:10  <jmcarthur> have we nailed down what version of ubuntu we're using, btw?
2011-03-02T10:40:20  <janzert> it seems everyone is using 10.10 right now at least
2011-03-02T10:41:46  <jmcarthur> alright
2011-03-02T10:43:25  <jmcarthur> sweet, looks like i'll be able to finally use a version of ghc released within the last two years
2011-03-02T10:43:46  <jmcarthur> ghc is a fast moving project
2011-03-02T10:43:48  <janzert> what's the package name?
2011-03-02T10:44:00  <janzert> I'm working on the worker setup script right now
2011-03-02T10:44:09  <jmcarthur> i think it's just ghc. if there is a haskell-platform package that would be better
2011-03-02T10:44:13  <janzert> currently it's using ghc6
2011-03-02T10:44:18  <jmcarthur> i'll just check
2011-03-02T10:44:57  <janzert> I see ghc6 and haskell-utils that look haskell related
2011-03-02T10:45:03  <jmcarthur> janzert: https://launchpad.net/~justinbogner/+archive/haskell-platform
2011-03-02T10:45:47  <jmcarthur> janzert: eventually there will be an additional step, since the haskell starter package i'm making will rely on a library i'm making, but the library isn't on hackage yet
2011-03-02T10:46:18  <janzert> I assume that version is only in the ppa not the main repository?
2011-03-02T10:46:22  <jmcarthur> oh, hmm. lucid isn't 10.10
2011-03-02T10:46:30  <jmcarthur> i was mixing ubuntus up
2011-03-02T10:46:42  <janzert> maverick right?
2011-03-02T10:46:47  <jmcarthur> yeah i guess
2011-03-02T10:46:55  <jmcarthur> i don't know if there is a ppa for maverick
2011-03-02T10:47:09  <jmcarthur> that ppa is for the haskell platform, which most haskell users are accustomed to having
2011-03-02T10:47:18  <jmcarthur> it has the most frequently used libraries and stuff
2011-03-02T10:47:32  <janzert> hmm, yeah looks like it only has a lucid version though
2011-03-02T10:48:06  <jmcarthur> ah, haskell-platform is in maverick's universe repo
2011-03-02T10:48:26  <janzert> great
2011-03-02T10:52:39  <jmcarthur> great, it's ghc 6.12.1
2011-03-02T10:52:50  <jmcarthur> kind of a buggy version. surprised they haven't made it 6.12.3
2011-03-02T10:52:53  <jmcarthur> oh well
2011-03-02T10:52:59  <jmcarthur> better than 6.6 or 6.8

2011-03-02T11:44:24  <McLeopold> janzert: support for python3 would be nice
2011-03-02T11:44:47  <McLeopold> janzert: but then we need something besides filename extension to detect languages
2011-03-02T11:44:53  <janzert> let me get what we have working first :)
2011-03-02T11:45:00  <janzert> McLeopold: yeah
2011-03-02T11:45:14  <McLeopold> it makes submission a bit harder for newbs
2011-03-02T11:45:33  <janzert> or just let them all be marked as binary packages and use the hash bang
2011-03-02T11:46:02  <McLeopold> hash bang would work
2011-03-02T11:46:18  <DanielVF> mybot.py3 ?
2011-03-02T11:46:20  <McLeopold> for detection
2011-03-02T11:46:32  <McLeopold> that too
2011-03-02T11:46:57  <McLeopold> .py assumes version 2, or you can use .py2 / .py3
2011-03-02T11:47:55  <McLeopold> janzert: so, how much work do you plan to do right now?  what's your current goal?
2011-03-02T11:49:15  <janzert> just get the worker setup stuff running, and if you don't get to it I may do the compilation on workers move
2011-03-02T11:49:58  <janzert> but if you're currently working on adapting stuff for multiplayer I think we'd step on each other right now
2011-03-02T11:50:21  <DanielVF> One problem with the old code is that two workers one the same server could try to compile the same bot simultaneously.
2011-03-02T11:50:43  <janzert> DanielVF: that was already worked around
2011-03-02T11:51:05  <janzert> compilation is done in a temporary directory and then moved into the final position
2011-03-02T11:51:12  <DanielVF> great
2011-03-02T11:51:25  <DanielVF> Sounds good
2011-03-02T11:51:32  <DanielVF> enough
2011-03-02T11:51:33  <janzert> the old method managed to cause some actual problems in the last contest
2011-03-02T11:51:44  <DanielVF> *nods*
2011-03-02T11:52:11  <DanielVF> I was gonna change it to the temp dir, but ran out of time
2011-03-02T11:52:18  <McLeopold> why does a worker need to tourament managers?
2011-03-02T11:52:21  <McLeopold> 2
2011-03-02T11:52:48  <janzert> because it was the most efficient use of servers last time
2011-03-02T11:52:52  <DanielVF> A better solution would be to prefetch the next game and bots while one round is playing
2011-03-02T11:52:58  <DanielVF> then compile and play
2011-03-02T11:53:10  * janzert nods
2011-03-02T11:53:24  <DanielVF> and copy the bots into place during the prefetch
2011-03-02T11:53:25  <McLeopold> janzert: I am going to work on worker communication next
2011-03-02T11:53:41  <McLeopold> And, I already need to rewrite the manager
2011-03-02T11:53:52  <janzert> great
2011-03-02T11:53:53  <DanielVF> Because most games happened very quickly
2011-03-02T11:54:06  <McLeopold> Maybe I could attempt to make the manager use processes or threads and keep it running always?
2011-03-02T11:54:07  <DanielVF> the server spent almost as much time downloading as playing
2011-03-02T11:54:25  <DanielVF> You could give that a shot
2011-03-02T11:54:38  <janzert> DanielVF: that pattern changed once a worker was up for an hour or two
2011-03-02T11:54:41  <McLeopold> The manager could do the downloads and create a compile or play process
2011-03-02T11:54:46  <DanielVF> if it turns out too complicated, you could ditch it.
2011-03-02T11:55:04  <DanielVF> Or have one play/compile process
2011-03-02T11:55:16  <DanielVF> that get's handed games
2011-03-02T11:55:26  <DanielVF> and one fetch process that gets them ready
2011-03-02T11:55:39  <janzert> it's going to be pretty much impossible to use the servers as efficiently with n-player games
2011-03-02T11:56:10  <McLeopold> well, once a worker has all submissions, it would be pretty fast
2011-03-02T11:56:19  <DanielVF> *nods*
2011-03-02T11:56:20  <jmcarthur> do we even have a plan for what to do with fewer cores than bots?
2011-03-02T11:56:33  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-02T11:56:56  <McLeopold> some signal stuff? wasn't jeff trying that?
2011-03-02T11:57:00  <janzert> that's why I've been saying we can only go up to 8 player games

2011-03-02T11:58:55  <jmcarthur> that would work
2011-03-02T11:59:06  <jmcarthur> sequentially hand bots moves, SIGSTOP when they shouldn't be running
2011-03-02T11:59:41  <jmcarthur> there goes my usual method of continuing to run my bot between sending orders and receiving the next update from the engine ;)
2011-03-02T12:00:00  <McLeopold> I'll try it.
2011-03-02T12:00:14  <McLeopold> Then we can have 1000 player games.
2011-03-02T12:00:18  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-03-02T12:00:21  <McLeopold> for the final
2011-03-02T12:00:41  <jmcarthur> this also means we can have the rather simple arrangement of n games going going at a time on n cores
2011-03-02T12:00:44  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: maybe a bots first submission need to be a game with lots of players?
2011-03-02T12:00:54  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i think so, yes
2011-03-02T12:01:09  <McLeopold> I've been thinking of the match making algo.
2011-03-02T12:01:30  <jmcarthur> not going with trueskill's?
2011-03-02T12:01:38  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-02T12:01:48  <McLeopold> When a bot's number is called, the matcher will pick an n-player game that the bot hasn't played in awhile.  so the number of players always rotates.
2011-03-02T12:01:59  <DanielVF> With many bots in one game, it's important to have some kind of individual score at the end of the game
2011-03-02T12:02:14  <DanielVF> So that we can do
2011-03-02T12:02:17  <McLeopold> TrueSkill doesn't really match players, it just tells you how good a match is predicted to be
2011-03-02T12:02:18  <DanielVF> a > b > c> d
2011-03-02T12:02:27  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: that is the case here
2011-03-02T12:02:34  <DanielVF> Yup
2011-03-02T12:02:49  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: right. so we could just have a pool of bots that haven't played in a while then, right?
2011-03-02T12:03:05  <jmcarthur> and pick matches from it probabilitistically?
2011-03-02T12:03:12  <jmcarthur> *probabilistically
2011-03-02T12:04:02  <McLeopold> yes, but I would pick 1 at a time
2011-03-02T12:04:21  <jmcarthur> well, pick one bot that needs to play *right now*, and then pick the other bots for it to play with in the next game
2011-03-02T12:04:41  <janzert> does SIGSTOP stop all children as well?
2011-03-02T12:04:45  <McLeopold> get the seed bot, pick the next that hasn't played it in awhile, pick the 3rd that hasn't played the other 2 in awhile...
2011-03-02T12:04:46  <jmcarthur> janzert: i think so
2011-03-02T12:04:48  <DanielVF> I think new submissions get extra games starts. Makes things more addictive, and keeps the scoreboard more accurate.
2011-03-02T12:04:48  <DanielVF> *nods*
2011-03-02T12:04:49  <janzert> ok
2011-03-02T12:04:50  * DanielVF afk
2011-03-02T12:05:18  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: well, surely we still want to take skill into consideration, too
2011-03-02T12:06:00  <McLeopold> yes, but I want the "to tag backs" logic to constrain the pool that trueskill picks from
2011-03-02T12:06:07  <McLeopold> *no tag backs*
2011-03-02T12:06:13  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-02T12:06:15  <jmcarthur> that's reasonable
2011-03-02T12:06:30  <McLeopold> it's the same we did for planet wars
2011-03-02T12:06:32  <jmcarthur> as long as it doesnt overconstrain it
2011-03-02T12:06:50  <jmcarthur> it's rather play a few of the same bots than be forced to play significantly badly matched bots
2011-03-02T12:06:52  <jmcarthur> *i'd
2011-03-02T12:07:26  <McLeopold> but, antimatroid made a good point last night, that bots do need to play outside their skill level a few times

2011-03-02T12:07:34  <jmcarthur> *than be forced to play badly matched bots very frequently
2011-03-02T12:07:49  <jmcarthur> i also agree with that
2011-03-02T12:08:07  <jmcarthur> otherwise there is a risk of overfitting in your local area and not being able to move up or down properly
2011-03-02T12:08:59  <janzert> I think planetwars distribution did fairly well but there are definitely improvements that could be made
2011-03-02T12:09:08  <McLeopold> right, so if I'm playing halo, I want the game to be close so it is fun.  But in a tournament, we want the games to be informative of tactics.
2011-03-02T12:09:29  <jmcarthur> that kind of happened to me in the tron contest. a few versions of my bot did better against top ranking bots than mid ranking bots. my attempts to fix that ended up hurting me against the top bots though
2011-03-02T12:10:06  <McLeopold> I'd like to think my pw bot was the one that surprised the top bots. :)
2011-03-02T12:10:12  <jmcarthur> heh

2011-03-02T12:16:21  <McLeopold> janzert: can we support a bash bot?
2011-03-02T12:16:30  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-02T12:16:36  <janzert> I think we should
2011-03-02T12:16:38  <jmcarthur> lol
2011-03-02T12:16:41  <jmcarthur> harccore
2011-03-02T12:16:45  <jmcarthur> *hardcore
2011-03-02T12:16:52  <janzert> it's basically the same as supporting binaries
2011-03-02T12:16:59  <jmcarthur> i want somebody to win with a bash bpot
2011-03-02T12:17:01  <jmcarthur> *bot
2011-03-02T12:17:22  <jmcarthur> it's not quite the same. with binaries there's that argument about architecture dependency
2011-03-02T12:17:45  <McLeopold> yes, but at least we can say, compile on ubuntuserver 10.10
2011-03-02T12:17:56  <McLeopold> uhh..
2011-03-02T12:18:01  <McLeopold> wait
2011-03-02T12:18:04  <jmcarthur> at least with bash you aren't necessarily calling out to a precompiled binary without knowing the architecture
2011-03-02T12:18:23  <jmcarthur> although you could
2011-03-02T12:19:26  <janzert> jmcarthur: yeah, I just meant if we support bash it's trivial for people to use any arbitrary binary submission
2011-03-02T12:19:33  <jmcarthur> could do that anyway
2011-03-02T12:19:36  <jmcarthur> exec, etc.
2011-03-02T12:21:29  <janzert> yeah, but "#!/bin/bash\n mybinarybot" is really trivial :)
2011-03-02T12:22:38  <jmcarthur> that alone won't work
2011-03-02T12:22:43  <jmcarthur> still need exec
2011-03-02T12:22:57  <jmcarthur> but yeah
2011-03-02T12:23:19  <jmcarthur> #!/bin/bash\n exec mybinarybot
2011-03-02T12:23:28  <janzert> ahh, yeah
2011-03-02T12:24:06  <jmcarthur> needs to be fancier if you want to have a choice between 32 or 64 bit based on architecture or something, but i digress

2011-03-02T20:31:50  <antiuni> they only got 0.5 previously
2011-03-02T20:31:55  <antiuni> i would set it at 0.5
2011-03-02T20:32:01  <antiuni> well, 0.5 in the worst case

2011-03-02T20:48:41  <Frontier> With all the LOLCODE inspiration I got an idea!
2011-03-02T20:48:53  <McLeopold> Frontier: lolcode is missing some stuff
2011-03-02T20:50:20  <Frontier> If IE cannot display the canvas, but it supports a Java plugin... then I could try and load my JavaScript into a JavaScript interpeter for Java and connect the canvas functions to Java2D drawing routines :D
2011-03-02T20:50:36  <Frontier> great idea or wha?
2011-03-02T20:50:47  <McLeopold> i can haz recursion?
2011-03-02T20:51:06  <Frontier> lolcode has no recursion? orly?
2011-03-02T20:51:14  <Frontier> kthxbye

2011-03-02T20:52:52  <Frontier> I don't know if it compiles though
2011-03-02T20:54:18  <Frontier> lol shit, now I have an irresistible urge to write comments like "i can not haz canvas? mkay, gonna try java" in my code

2011-03-02T21:03:41  <jmcarthur> antiuni: huh? they got a second previously
2011-03-02T21:04:57  <antiuni> i almost want to do my bot in lolcode now
2011-03-02T21:05:34  <antiuni> jmcarthur: not if your opponent was also using their time
2011-03-02T21:05:45  <antiuni> each server had 2 games playing at once, each server had but two cores
2011-03-02T21:05:51  <antiuni> meaning two bots were playing on a core at a time
2011-03-02T21:06:02  <jmcarthur> antiuni: multicore
2011-03-02T21:06:06  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-03-02T21:06:13  <jmcarthur> two games at once. didn't realize that
2011-03-02T21:06:21  <antiuni> i wanted it changed, but it was too late

2011-03-02T21:06:46  <jmcarthur> that's lame
2011-03-02T21:07:28  <jmcarthur> i would go for one game per core where each bot executes sequentially
2011-03-02T21:07:32  <jmcarthur> best throughput and fairness
2011-03-02T21:07:42  <antiuni> that's what i wanted, but no one else seemed to think it was important
2011-03-02T21:07:52  <antiuni> that's why i'm a little surprised people are talking about changing it again
2011-03-02T21:08:05  <jmcarthur> well it's coming up now because there are >2 bots per game
2011-03-02T21:08:31  <antiuni> yeah, it was just going to be set at a higher amount with varying amounts of time per turn per game
2011-03-02T21:08:40  <antiuni> again, it wasn't what i liked, it
2011-03-02T21:08:46  <antiuni> s what people seemed to decide on previously
2011-03-02T21:12:52  <jmcarthur> i do still think that our idea about having a pool of time and stuff might be nice

2011-03-02T21:25:02  <amstan> Todd200: hi
2011-03-02T21:25:30  <Todd200> Hey amstan :)
2011-03-02T21:26:01  <Todd200> The next contest looks like it's going to come out good
2011-03-02T21:26:30  <amstan> Todd200: indeed, the future looks bright
2011-03-02T21:26:36  <Todd200> Why can't you guys do something like BOINC for simulating battles? Then people could donate processing power
2011-03-02T21:27:17  <amstan> Todd200: how secure is it though?
2011-03-02T21:27:39  <Todd200> Not sure
2011-03-02T21:27:51  <amstan> Todd200: what would stop contestants from joining the grid and making returning that their bot won all the time
2011-03-02T21:28:29  <Todd200> True, but the 6 games per min was terrible last time :/
2011-03-02T21:28:56  <amstan> that was the crappy days
2011-03-02T21:29:00  <amstan> when we had difficulties
2011-03-02T21:30:19  <Todd200> With Elo my bot lost vs a bot in the top 10, so Elo said "put him in rank 22" I was happy for a few hours
2011-03-02T21:30:41  <amstan> we're using trueskill this time
2011-03-02T21:30:58  <Todd200> Yep, looks like it will work well
2011-03-02T21:31:37  <amstan> Todd200: "A credit management system helps to ensure that users are returning results which are both scientifically and statistically accurate." ~ BOINC
2011-03-02T21:31:59  <amstan> Todd200: there's no point in cheating for BOINC
2011-03-02T21:32:30  <Todd200> It's used for cancer research, among other things

2011-03-02T21:34:16  <amstan> Todd200: antimatroid is working on some text for it on the wiki: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki
2011-03-02T21:34:21  <amstan> Todd200: see the ants pages
2011-03-02T21:36:35  <Todd200> Are you guys using the same rules for a bot crashing as last time?
2011-03-02T21:36:50  <amstan> probably
2011-03-02T21:38:28  <Todd200> Why not have a bot just pass if it tries to do something invalid, Instead of stopping the game, just move no ants for that player
2011-03-02T21:38:58  <amstan> Frontier: close the issue?
2011-03-02T21:39:47  <amstan> Todd200: if the game can last a maximum of 200 turns.. and ignore any invalid move/timeout
2011-03-02T21:39:52  <amstan> Todd200: then you'll waste 200 seconds
2011-03-02T21:39:55  <Frontier> amstan: sorry? what issue?
2011-03-02T21:40:06  <amstan> Frontier: the ie stuff with canvas, can i close it?
2011-03-02T21:40:11  <amstan> Frontier: if we give up on it
2011-03-02T21:40:20  <Todd200> Assuming that other bot lacks the ability to destroy it
2011-03-02T21:40:29  <Frontier> no
2011-03-02T21:40:37  <amstan> Todd200: they bots time out?
2011-03-02T21:40:53  <Todd200> Then call the match
2011-03-02T21:41:03  <Todd200> Or give each bot 3 strikes
2011-03-02T21:41:13  <amstan> Todd200: maybe, but...
2011-03-02T21:41:15  <Frontier> I'm trying a JavaScript<->JavaApplet bridge first when I get Java and IE to run on wine.
2011-03-02T21:41:20  <amstan> Frontier: ok..
2011-03-02T21:42:37  <amstan> Todd200: rather complicated
2011-03-02T21:42:47  <Todd200> True
2011-03-02T21:42:51  <Frontier> who was giving up on the canvas?
2011-03-02T21:43:03  <_flag> Fronteir: have you tried looking into Google Chrome Frame? I don't think IE users are a significant enough portion of the userbase at only 5% to be worrying about tbh
2011-03-02T21:43:11  <amstan> Frontier: wasn't it you? lol
2011-03-02T21:43:15  <Frontier> it renders a frame every 4 seconds and looks like pre-90s, but hey! it works
2011-03-02T21:43:37  <amstan> _flag: oh! that was you!
2011-03-02T21:43:39  <Todd200> Because I know that my bot last time would crash if the strongest planet was being attacked and would be destroyed,

2011-03-02T23:40:16  <antimatroid1> from what is actually passed to them that is
2011-03-02T23:44:22  <antimatroid1> also, for future reference, the engine is now ignoring invalid moves and a crashed bot score gets frozen, but their ants remain on the board "not moving" each turn
2011-03-02T23:44:49  <jmcarthur> cool
2011-03-02T23:44:58  <sigh> why don't they lose immediately?

2011-03-02T23:45:27  <sigh> ah, makes sense
2011-03-02T23:45:48  <antimatroid1> i almost think their score shouldn't be frozen
2011-03-02T23:46:00  <antimatroid1> it is a competition testing ones ability to make ai over programming afterall

2011-03-02T23:47:16  <jmcarthur> i don't see any reason to disqualify a crashing bot
2011-03-02T23:47:21  <sigh> disqualified from the game, not the tournament
2011-03-02T23:47:29  <jmcarthur> they get ranked low. big deal
2011-03-02T23:47:31  <antimatroid1> if it's crashing lots it's wasting resources
2011-03-02T23:47:40  <jmcarthur> it's not like a crashing bot really takes many resources
2011-03-02T23:47:45  <jmcarthur> they crash. they're done
2011-03-02T23:48:02  <antimatroid1> true, but isn't there meant to be a fair bit of overhead with running games too?
2011-03-02T23:48:06  <jmcarthur> they get whatever score they deserve
2011-03-02T23:48:15  <antimatroid1> okay, it's fine as is :)
2011-03-02T23:49:56  <sigh> ok, I haven't read the specs in a while but... how do you score if the ants aren't moving?
2011-03-02T23:50:09  *** antimatroid <antimatroid!~Nick@236.234-27-211.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-02T23:51:01  <antimatroid> sigh: have you read the scoring system?
2011-03-02T23:51:12  <sigh> no :D
2011-03-02T23:51:32  <antimatroid> if an ant dies, any enemy ants in range (currently dying or live) get an equal proportion of that ants points, which are then passed onto the owner if the owner hasn't crashed
2011-03-02T23:51:52  <antimatroid> there is also a food bonus at the end, but that's not the main part of scoring
2011-03-02T23:52:12  <jmcarthur> so if an ant dies while in range of two of A's ants and one of B's ants, A gets twice as many points as B?
2011-03-02T23:52:21  <antimatroid> *currently dying from battle, ants are removed from collisions before that
2011-03-02T23:52:21  *** antimatroid1 <antimatroid1!~Nick@13.129-134-203.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-03-02T23:52:27  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: yes
2011-03-02T23:52:51  <jmcarthur> of course, depending on the combat resolution, both A's might die anyway
2011-03-02T23:53:06  <antimatroid> yeah, i still can't believe that's even a question
2011-03-02T23:53:09  <antimatroid> battle option 1 is so much better
2011-03-02T23:53:17  <jmcarthur> hmm... would the scoring really even make a difference with option 2?
2011-03-02T23:53:28  <jmcarthur> oh i guess it would still work
2011-03-02T23:53:28  <antimatroid> not sure, i've not thought about option 2 in ages
2011-03-02T23:53:34  <antimatroid> i still expect the better option to prevail
2011-03-02T23:53:47  <jmcarthur> i don't. i expect whatever option j3camero likes to prevail
2011-03-02T23:53:57  <jmcarthur> it may be the better. it may not
2011-03-02T23:54:19  <antimatroid> meh, i'll fight that one to the end
2011-03-02T23:54:35  <antimatroid> i'd prefer to play on a separate tcp server otherwise

2011-03-02T23:56:26  <antimatroid> sigh: did you see the hitler learns maths video?
2011-03-02T23:56:29  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-02T23:56:32  <antimatroid> so good
2011-03-02T23:56:57  <sigh> I only have a passing familiarity with topology

2011-03-02T23:57:16  <jmcarthur> i'll start....
2011-03-02T23:57:18  <antimatroid> yeah, i've not actually done it formally other than stuff in analysis, i have point set up next semester
2011-03-02T23:57:20  <jmcarthur> antimatroid wins
2011-03-02T23:57:26  <jmcarthur> darn. thought i had a chance that time
2011-03-02T23:58:00  <antimatroid> did you guys see the juggling geese thing on reddit?
2011-03-02T23:58:05  <sigh> no
2011-03-02T23:58:12  <antimatroid> i'll start you where i started
