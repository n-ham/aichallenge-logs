2010-09-26T00:03:45  <rwa> the difference between a timeout on tcp and main server is ridiculous
2010-09-26T00:04:06  <rwa> the amount of computation you can do I mean...
2010-09-26T00:04:27  <sigh> tcp is to account for network latency

2010-09-26T02:57:35  <Janzert> Anand_: Pretty sure I've seen numpy mentioned as being loaded and scipy wasn't but the admin was going to look into possibly adding it later
2010-09-26T02:57:49  <Zannick> Anand_: at the very worst, you can include the .py files in your zip

2010-09-26T06:13:54  <_W_> krokokrusa, seems like that is the way most games turn out - one side gets a slight respawn advantage, and sticks to it, while the opponent sends everything to try to even it out
2010-09-26T06:14:42  <_W_> oh wait, red *didn't* actually have an advantage

2010-09-26T06:34:55  <boegel> I'm wondering...
2010-09-26T06:35:02  <boegel> how does ELO handle updated bots?
2010-09-26T06:35:17  <boegel> say I've played against botX which was at rank 200 at the time I played it
2010-09-26T06:35:46  <boegel> and then botX got updated (new submission)... does it just use the new rank of botX then?
2010-09-26T06:36:04  <boegel> or does it ignore that game, because it's outdated or somesuch?
2010-09-26T06:37:00  <krokokrusa> imo the latter
2010-09-26T06:37:26  <krokokrusa> ELO is meant to be used when "true rank" of a player is constant or changes very slowly
2010-09-26T06:37:55  <boegel> I see
2010-09-26T06:38:03  <krokokrusa> so it doesn't suit well for updated bots which change ranks like crazy
2010-09-26T06:39:51  <krokokrusa> I think the game is always discarded right after its contribution to the ELO is calculated

2010-09-26T07:07:13  <Mathiasdm> I'm looking for ideas on why my bot doesn't go beyond the first move on the official servers
2010-09-26T07:07:20  <Mathiasdm> even though it works fine locally
2010-09-26T07:07:23  *** RainCT <RainCT!~RainCT@ubuntu/member/pdpc.student.rainct> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-26T07:07:33  <Mathiasdm> timeouts maybe? or are there other possibilities?
2010-09-26T07:12:59  <boegel> Mathiasdm: invalid order, e.g. more ships (in total) than there are on a planet
2010-09-26T07:13:24  <boegel> Mathiasdm: maybe try playing it on the TCP server, see http://http://72.44.46.68/
2010-09-26T07:13:39  <boegel> Mathiasdm: that will tell you whether it's time-out or invalid move
2010-09-26T07:13:57  <Mathiasdm> okay, will try
2010-09-26T07:14:36  <boegel> Mathiasdm: if it works fine there, then it might still be a time-out on the official server (which is more strict than TCP afaik)
2010-09-26T07:14:57  <Mathiasdm> heh, weird
2010-09-26T07:14:58  <Mathiasdm> I get
2010-09-26T07:15:03  <Mathiasdm> : No such file or directory
2010-09-26T07:17:09  <boegel> Mathiasdm: show the command line (but change the password! ;))
2010-09-26T07:17:58  <Mathiasdm> ./tcp 72.44.46.68 995 Mathiasdm -p NotMyPassword ./MyBot.py
2010-09-26T07:19:17  <boegel> Mathiasdm: I think you need to specifiy "python ./MyBot.py" or something?
2010-09-26T07:19:36  <boegel> Mathiasdm: also, is MyBot.py located in the directory where you executed this command,
2010-09-26T07:19:37  <boegel> ?
2010-09-26T07:19:55  <boegel> Mathiasdm: and did you download tcp.c and compile tcp in that same directory?
2010-09-26T07:20:07  <Mathiasdm> to everything, yes
2010-09-26T07:20:13  <Mathiasdm> and I will try "python MyBot.py"
2010-09-26T07:20:48  <boegel> Mathiasdm: double check on the 'tcp' binary
2010-09-26T07:20:50  <Mathiasdm> hm, doesn't work
2010-09-26T07:21:07  <BtbN> hm, strange issue with C#... On My PC the String-To-Double function only takes ',' as separation char. On server it seems like it only accepts '.', which causes some problems.
2010-09-26T07:21:27  <boegel> BtbN: locale settings probably
2010-09-26T07:21:33  <Zaphus> BtbN - are you european perhaps ?
2010-09-26T07:21:37  <BtbN> yep
2010-09-26T07:21:45  <BtbN> on my PC it takes the local char, which is ,
2010-09-26T07:21:50  <Zaphus> yeah, locale issue - they had it with another language too
2010-09-26T07:21:59  <Mathiasdm> boegel: doing only './tcp' gives 'usage: ./tcp ip port username [-p password] command [args]
2010-09-26T07:22:38  <Mathiasdm> ahaaa
2010-09-26T07:22:42  <Mathiasdm> found it

2010-09-26T07:23:15  <Mathiasdm> but it doesn't seem to do much
2010-09-26T07:23:31  <Mathiasdm> it says the game_id and such, but I don't see any output after that
2010-09-26T07:23:43  <Mathiasdm> aha
2010-09-26T07:23:44  <Mathiasdm> okay
2010-09-26T07:23:58  <Mathiasdm> now it gave an error :) in the official part, not in my code
2010-09-26T07:24:05  <Mathiasdm> will research some more :)
2010-09-26T07:24:52  <boegel> Mathiasdm: it starts the game, and then communicates with the server sending orders (no output then)

2010-09-26T09:04:46  <krokokrusa> :)
2010-09-26T09:04:53  <boegel> my bot is trying to be conservative about the ships it spends
2010-09-26T09:05:16  <boegel> but it's too conservative now, it should take a little bit of risk to get ahead
2010-09-26T09:05:44  <boegel> e.g. conquer on of the planets on my side, to increase the overall growth rate
2010-09-26T09:05:51  <boegel> trying to fix other stuff first though :)
2010-09-26T09:06:25  <antimatroid> this thing tonight is a complete mess code wise
2010-09-26T09:06:36  <antimatroid> trying a few new things then just taped that together with old stuff
2010-09-26T09:06:48  <antimatroid> and hoped it works, seems to be somewhat alright, but fails against anyone good
2010-09-26T09:06:51  <antimatroid> no offense :P
2010-09-26T09:08:39  <boegel> antimatroid: do you consider a draw a failure? :)
2010-09-26T09:08:56  <boegel> antimatroid: also, I'm not offended
2010-09-26T09:09:11  <boegel> I have a lot of work to do before I get my bot up to speed fully
2010-09-26T09:09:28  <antimatroid> draw is more novelty than anything
2010-09-26T09:09:36  <boegel> novelty?
2010-09-26T09:10:35  <antimatroid> well it's pretty hard to come across a non trivial draw
2010-09-26T09:11:12  <boegel> I guess both are bots have the same conservaty rules in them :)

2010-09-26T09:44:01  <delt0r___> if the result is zero ships left. ownership does not change
2010-09-26T09:44:08  <Strepto> thanks
2010-09-26T09:44:41  <delt0r___> Its like risk... you need a "unit" to occupy the planet

2010-09-26T09:46:30  <Strepto> haven't really gotten that far yet
2010-09-26T09:46:39  <boegel> are ships in in-flight fleets also taken into account to check whether a game is win/draw/loss ?
2010-09-26T09:47:00  <delt0r___> boegel: yes
2010-09-26T09:47:11  <delt0r___> total ship including fleets
2010-09-26T09:47:16  <delt0r___> ships
2010-09-26T09:47:25  <boegel> delt0r___: k, thx, makes perfect sense, but just making sure :)
2010-09-26T09:47:31  <delt0r___> This is in the Game specification
2010-09-26T09:47:47  <Strepto> basically copying the planet states and fleets, then simulating turns and saving new planet states for each succesive turn
2010-09-26T09:48:18  <delt0r___> Strepto: me too--just thinking its perhaps not the most efficient...
2010-09-26T09:48:18  <Strepto> don't have it working yet tho, but *should* work
2010-09-26T09:48:33  <Strepto> ofc it isn't, it's massively ineffecient
2010-09-26T09:48:37  <delt0r___> But then it probablty doesn't really tax the number crunching
2010-09-26T09:49:19  <Strepto> the only problem is that forecasts are procedural, would be easier if you didn't have to account for previous turn
2010-09-26T09:49:45  <Strepto> and math isn't my strong suite
2010-09-26T09:49:46  <delt0r___> Its the 3 way battels imo that make it a little hard
2010-09-26T09:49:51  <delt0r___> its not "linear"
2010-09-26T09:50:00  <Strepto> how do you mean?
2010-09-26T09:50:02  <delt0r___> so you just "add" new fleets easily
2010-09-26T09:50:26  <delt0r___> Well simulate with all the fleets till the end
2010-09-26T09:50:47  <BtbN> hm, i think i still have no idea how to make a realy good AI, it's still loosing most matches against the Test-AIs
2010-09-26T09:50:58  <delt0r___> next turn add new fleets...
2010-09-26T09:51:07  <Strepto> I don't care about fleets, I just want to know how planet ownership changes and number of ships on a planet for each coming turn (provided no actions are taken)
2010-09-26T09:51:30  <delt0r___> Strepto: but its fleets that determin that
2010-09-26T09:53:14  <Strepto> I feel like I'm missing your point...
2010-09-26T09:53:30  <delt0r___> doesn't matter
2010-09-26T09:53:34  <Strepto> guess not
2010-09-26T09:54:13  <delt0r___> just saying there is no obvious incremental update to future states
2010-09-26T09:55:25  <Strepto> even when disregarding future actions?
2010-09-26T09:55:59  <delt0r___> all additional fleets *are* a future action
2010-09-26T09:56:15  <krokokrusa> delt0r___ is trying to say that incoming fleets affect future planet's states too
2010-09-26T09:56:29  <Strepto> aah, I don't take future actions into account at all atm, think that's where we differ

2010-09-26T12:55:06  <JensT1> I uploaded my bot 11th of september, and was doing reasonably well for a couple of day's
2010-09-26T12:55:23  <JensT1> then left for 2weeks of holiday
2010-09-26T12:55:31  <JensT1> and now it seems to timeout all the time =(
2010-09-26T12:55:34  <Migi32> woah a1kon your 0.4.1 bot is quite aggressive
2010-09-26T12:55:51  <user_> hi , plz let me know how to log in java?
2010-09-26T12:56:05  <JensT1> user_: try the example command, but do not use log.txt, since this get's overwritten
2010-09-26T12:56:07  <JensT1> uses mylog.txt
2010-09-26T12:56:51  <JensT1> or you could get the source for Engine.java and decomment the commented line that enables output to stdout
2010-09-26T12:57:12  <user_> if from my program if i want to log something , what to do? i tried System.err.Println() and it is not logging

2010-09-26T13:00:46  <JensT1> you will have output
2010-09-26T13:01:08  <user_> Thanks JensTl
2010-09-26T13:01:26  <JensT1> user_: this might make the other bot crash sometimes because it get's unexpected input
2010-09-26T13:02:50  <JensT1> but normally lines starting with '#' should be saftely used
2010-09-26T13:03:12  <JensT1> but it still kept crashing sometimes
2010-09-26T13:03:30  <JensT1> but should work much better that way already :)
2010-09-26T13:03:57  <JensT1> I think it only crashed if your lines start's with 'go' or something

2010-09-26T14:45:21  <dmj111> takes into account how long it takes to capture a planet and earn back the ships it took
2010-09-26T14:45:33  <BtbN> Yeah, i'm using something similar, but my AI sucks atm :D
2010-09-26T14:45:40  <BtbN> well, it's still some kind of first-try
2010-09-26T14:46:01  <dmj111> i have other logic to find acceptable targets, and then sort by different criteria.
2010-09-26T14:46:01  <BtbN> spend most time writing my own "framework", as the one in the starter-package has some problems
2010-09-26T14:46:38  <BtbN> i like this base-planet style, but didn't manage to implement something like it successfully
2010-09-26T14:46:54  <BtbN> messing with cygwin for the tcp-stuff atm :D
2010-09-26T14:47:33  <dmj111> yeah... fortunately I have a linux box in the basement, so I run everything from there.

2010-09-26T15:09:54  <user_> can sumeone help me how can i print the required debug statements to console?
2010-09-26T15:10:02  <user_> In java
2010-09-26T15:10:23  <boiserm> user_ you'll have to write to a file
2010-09-26T15:10:31  <delt0r___> use a different game engine...
2010-09-26T15:10:36  <delt0r___> use std err
2010-09-26T15:10:37  <BtbN> hm, which Username does the tcp-client ask for?
2010-09-26T15:11:13  <user_> i am doing std err , still i cant able to  see my error msgs in log..
2010-09-26T15:11:22  <boiserm> user_ if you stick with the PlayGame.jar engine, try creating a debug function that wraps something like what's in this example code: http://www.roseindia.net/java/example/java/io/java-append-to-file.shtml
2010-09-26T15:11:45  <delt0r___> user_:  not on the server and not with the provided Gameplayer
2010-09-26T15:12:13  <BtbN> Or try the cpp engine, it seems to log stderr output to log.txt
2010-09-26T15:12:27  <delt0r___> BtbN: so does my java engine
2010-09-26T15:12:30  <delt0r___> there are a few
2010-09-26T15:12:54  <BtbN> Was a pain to compile the damned thing on Windows...
2010-09-26T15:13:18  <BtbN> If they pack a VS-Project with it, i'd expect the code to know about windows
2010-09-26T15:13:56  <delt0r___> my bot is totally retarded
2010-09-26T15:14:01  <delt0r___> the more i add to it
2010-09-26T15:14:05  <delt0r___> the worse it gets

2010-09-26T15:15:06  <boiserm> well, then, no problem
2010-09-26T15:15:18  <boiserm> for some definition of problem
2010-09-26T15:15:23  <delt0r___> the problem is writing a good bot
2010-09-26T15:15:25  <delt0r___> ;)
2010-09-26T15:15:33  <boiserm> agreed :(
2010-09-26T15:15:42  <BtbN> again, which username does tcp.exe expect?

2010-09-26T15:16:07  <BtbN> ah
2010-09-26T15:16:08  <BtbN> ok
2010-09-26T15:19:28  <Olathe> An excellent UI advancement :)
2010-09-26T15:20:22  <BtbN> hm, the tcp-client exits after the game?
2010-09-26T15:20:27  <Olathe> dhartmei did a good job there.
2010-09-26T15:20:32  <delt0r___> BtbN: yes
2010-09-26T15:20:40  <Olathe> Yeah, it does. You can write a script or batch file to loop it, if you'd like.
2010-09-26T15:20:46  <delt0r___> you use a script to loop it --if thats what you want
2010-09-26T15:20:57  <BtbN> yeah, i planed letting it play a while
2010-09-26T15:21:04  <delt0r___> again there are a few "engines" that do it for you and show the game as it goes
2010-09-26T15:21:29  <BtbN> so tcp-client + visualizer?
2010-09-26T15:21:30  <delt0r___> like mine
2010-09-26T15:21:33  <delt0r___> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=751
2010-09-26T15:22:04  <delt0r___> you can set how many games to play and it will save the replays too
2010-09-26T15:22:05  <Olathe> Someone was going to make a Java visualizer for it.
2010-09-26T15:22:10  <delt0r___> I have

2010-09-26T15:22:24  <delt0r___> there are others too
2010-09-26T15:22:51  <delt0r___> mine is not what i would call polished
2010-09-26T15:23:08  <BtbN> non-native gui :/
2010-09-26T15:23:21  <delt0r___> ??
2010-09-26T15:23:34  <BtbN> The UI does not look native
2010-09-26T15:23:46  <delt0r___> you care about that crap? -- put the Set L&F line in yourself
2010-09-26T15:24:18  <BtbN> Well, i thought the java gui has ben re-done to look native automaticaly

2010-09-26T17:12:40  <boiserm> it's definitely something in the code
2010-09-26T17:13:23  <boiserm> I triple-checked every line, but I'm probably still overlooking something

2010-09-26T17:16:02  <Gredelston> Hey there, I have a question - I've been trying to get my bot to work, and it times out every time. I decided to double-check to see whether the starting bot (which I renamed so I could keep it) would work; it times out too. I use Python, and any Java bots I throw at the visualizer work. What's going on?
2010-09-26T17:17:06  <Zannick> how are you running it?
2010-09-26T17:17:08  <dmj111> have you tried just running "python yourbot.py"?  it should sit there doing nothing, but if there is a syntax error, you will find out.
2010-09-26T17:17:12  <Gredelston> cmd on Windows.
2010-09-26T17:17:29  <Gredelston> dmj111, it should work for the starting bot, no?
2010-09-26T17:17:39  <Zannick> what's the command, i mean?
2010-09-26T17:18:15  <Gredelston> java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" "python StarterBot.py" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-09-26T17:18:31  <Gredelston> and it's just sitting there now, dmj111. No syntax error.
2010-09-26T17:19:27  <Naktibalda> boiserm: watch some games and try to find differences
2010-09-26T17:20:04  <Naktibalda> it shouldn't be hard, because games of identical bots should be symetric

2010-09-26T17:27:41  <Gredelston> I am rather new to coding, so to double-check, Python does not have to be installed in the same directory or anything, correct?
2010-09-26T17:27:51  <Migi32> if I send a fleet at turn 2 to a planet 5 turns away according to the ceil(sqrt()) formula, will it arrive on turn 7 or 8?
2010-09-26T17:28:22  <Zannick> 7
2010-09-26T17:28:52  <Naktibalda> Gredelston: yes
2010-09-26T17:29:00  <Migi32> so if there's a fleet with 5 turns remaining on turn 2, the reinforcements I'd send would still arrive on time?
2010-09-26T17:29:01  <Zannick> the first time you see a fleet, its time remaining is one less than its total time
2010-09-26T17:29:10  <Gredelston> Naktibalda: Yes correct, or yes it has to be installed in the same directory?
2010-09-26T17:29:16  <Zannick> the last time, its time remaining is 1
2010-09-26T17:29:27  <Naktibalda> yes, correct
2010-09-26T17:29:44  <Gredelston> And the contest uses Python 3, correct? Not 2?
2010-09-26T17:29:52  <Naktibalda> 2.5 IMHO
2010-09-26T17:29:54  <Naktibalda> :)
2010-09-26T17:30:00  <Gredelston> Well, that could be a problem.
2010-09-26T17:30:01  <Migi32> so a fleet you send between 2 very close planets never shows up in the visualiser?
2010-09-26T17:30:05  <Gredelston> Looks like I've got some installing to do.
2010-09-26T17:30:05  <Zannick> Migi32: if you send a fleet to a planet 5 away when a fleet is also 5 away from that planet, they'll land at the same time

2010-09-26T17:34:04  <Zannick> for two planets of growth 1, dist has to be at least .8

2010-09-26T17:36:29  <teuneboon> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4801694 <-- here the distance is very small between 2 planets
2010-09-26T17:36:32  <teuneboon> so it's probably 1 I think
2010-09-26T17:36:59  <delt0r_> teuneboon: On the first 100 maps... the min distance is 2
2010-09-26T17:37:02  <Zannick> if the random values are 0.5, 0.5 then the first two planets are on the origin with the center planet
2010-09-26T17:37:03  <delt0r_> I checked.
2010-09-26T17:37:30  <delt0r_> The visulization makes the size of planets larger than one. So they look close

2010-09-26T18:41:49  <teuneboon> tcp.exe 72.44.46.68 995 teuneboon -p **** "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" MyBot > tcplog.txt
2010-09-26T18:42:01  <Zannick> yes, that will not work
2010-09-26T18:42:16  <Zannick> it is trying to run java as your bot
2010-09-26T18:42:16  <teuneboon> what's the problem with that? :P
2010-09-26T18:42:38  <teuneboon> oh ok, how do I fix that?
2010-09-26T18:42:46  <teuneboon> quotes aroudn the entire thing?
2010-09-26T18:42:54  <Migi32> by the way, how do you keep your bot running? The tcp.c from the site exits after 1 game...
2010-09-26T18:42:54  <Zannick> i'm not sure that will work
2010-09-26T18:43:00  <delt0r_> still need to escape the spaces in the path
2010-09-26T18:43:10  <teuneboon> hmm
2010-09-26T18:43:35  <Zannick> you probably want a batch file to run java My bot
2010-09-26T18:43:40  <Zannick> * MyBot
2010-09-26T18:43:43  <delt0r_> put java in your path... and try "java -cp classes MyBot"
2010-09-26T18:43:48  <delt0r_> or whatever
2010-09-26T18:43:54  <Zannick> Migi32: you can't, unless you wrap tcp.c in a loop
2010-09-26T18:44:00  <teuneboon> weird thing is
2010-09-26T18:44:03  <teuneboon> java is in my path
2010-09-26T18:44:03  <teuneboon> :P
2010-09-26T18:44:04  <Zannick> that doesn't technically keep your bot running
2010-09-26T18:44:11  <teuneboon> java in just cmd works
2010-09-26T18:44:14  <teuneboon> but in tcp it doesn't
2010-09-26T18:44:34  <delt0r_> think that Zannick is correct
2010-09-26T18:44:37  <Migi32> java tcp client has huge memory leaks for me
2010-09-26T18:44:38  <delt0r_> use a batch file
2010-09-26T18:44:48  <teuneboon> I'll use a batch
2010-09-26T18:44:49  <teuneboon> :P
2010-09-26T18:44:54  <Zannick> tcp doesn't like giving arguments to a program
2010-09-26T18:44:57  <delt0r_> Migi32: I have one without mem leaks in java
2010-09-26T18:45:29  <delt0r_> its a GUI one with a live replay... not pollished --but works
2010-09-26T18:45:37  <delt0r_> polished
2010-09-26T18:45:38  <teuneboon> tcp.exe 72.44.46.68 995 teuneboon -p **** MyBot.bat
2010-09-26T18:45:41  <teuneboon> it will be like that then?
2010-09-26T18:45:46  <Zannick> yeah
2010-09-26T18:46:37  <teuneboon> command terminated with exit status 1
2010-09-26T18:46:38  <teuneboon> XD
2010-09-26T18:46:45  <teuneboon> that's my log now XD
2010-09-26T18:46:58  <teuneboon> oh wait
2010-09-26T18:46:59  <teuneboon> my bad
2010-09-26T18:47:01  <delt0r_> does your batch file work without tcp...
2010-09-26T18:47:10  <teuneboon> it works
2010-09-26T18:47:11  <teuneboon> ty :P
2010-09-26T18:49:21  <teuneboon> ok, now how can I view the match?
2010-09-26T18:49:49  <teuneboon> I only see that I lose :P
2010-09-26T18:49:58  <delt0r_> online
2010-09-26T18:50:36  <delt0r_> otherwise there are a few tcp viewing clients... like i said. I wrote on... link on the forums...
2010-09-26T18:50:50  <teuneboon> I'll search for it :P
2010-09-26T18:50:52  <delt0r_> and you can save replays for later locally

2010-09-26T18:51:19  <teuneboon> ah, ty zannick
2010-09-26T18:52:04  <teuneboon> I lose quite a lot ^^
2010-09-26T18:52:17  <delt0r_> I lose every time
2010-09-26T18:52:29  <delt0r_> But not before looking like i could win
2010-09-26T18:52:30  <dwchandler> I lose a lot too
2010-09-26T18:52:36  <delt0r_> then my bot brain farts
2010-09-26T18:52:51  <delt0r_> and commits suicide.
2010-09-26T18:53:10  <teuneboon> haha
2010-09-26T18:53:22  <teuneboon> my bot makes some matches very long -_-
2010-09-26T18:53:32  <Zannick> haha, i looked at that match
2010-09-26T18:53:41  <Zannick> and was "where's the central planet?" D:
2010-09-26T18:53:59  <Zannick> looked at the playback...it's hiding under the other planets
2010-09-26T18:54:05  <Zannick> 93 ships, growth 0
2010-09-26T18:54:33  <teuneboon> what match? :P
2010-09-26T18:54:35  <teuneboon> mine?
2010-09-26T18:54:45  <Zannick> yes
2010-09-26T18:55:09  <teuneboon> XD
2010-09-26T18:55:14  <teuneboon> idd, I see some ships going to the centre
2010-09-26T18:55:18  <teuneboon> and dissapearing XD
2010-09-26T18:55:31  <teuneboon> hmm, my bot still seems to crash a lot :S
2010-09-26T18:56:19  <teuneboon> no error message though
2010-09-26T18:56:20  <teuneboon> :S
2010-09-26T18:57:00  <teuneboon> oh, because of invalid input
2010-09-26T18:57:07  <teuneboon> hmm, maybe on tcp send 0 is invalid?
2010-09-26T18:57:16  <teuneboon> cause mine does that sometimes :P

2010-09-26T19:00:32  <teuneboon> the tcp server doesn't accept send 0
2010-09-26T19:00:39  <teuneboon> while the local simulator does

2010-09-26T19:06:48  <teuneboon> a little bug in my code :P
2010-09-26T19:07:00  <Naktibalda> it was a very bad bug that caused some bots to crash, so it was fixed in server
2010-09-26T19:07:17  <teuneboon> instead of only sending when fleets to send was higher than 0 it was only sending when it was lower than 0
2010-09-26T19:07:18  <teuneboon> XD
2010-09-26T19:08:01  <u1tr0n> yep need to make each step over 9000 zerofleet and if you enimy count it he will crashed

2010-09-26T19:09:55  <teuneboon> so how do I test it continuosly? Just put it in a while loop in the .bat ?

2010-09-26T23:28:21  <jmcarthur> somebody said something about test cases being sanity checks and not proofs. i just wanted to add that the problem can be somewhat alleviated (but not entirely solved) by programmatically generating a good spread of test cases to check properties about your code, rather than simply checking specific cases.
2010-09-26T23:29:29  <jmcarthur> the hard part then becomes coming up with meaningful properties to check rather than coming up with some notion of "corner cases" to "test" (which normally amounts to simply running a code path with a few assertions)
