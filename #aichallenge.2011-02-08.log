2011-02-08T00:17:09  <antimatroid> i really like how you can make it hard for them to invase a slightly wider passage, but if they come in right, they'll get a better in ratio
2011-02-08T00:17:24  <antimatroid> kill* ratio
2011-02-08T00:26:17  <chris_0076> hmm, why are you using the euclidean distance metric when you move in a manhattan?
2011-02-08T00:26:23  <chris_0076> or am I reading it wrong?
2011-02-08T00:37:26  <antimatroid> mcleopold wanted that
2011-02-08T00:37:51  <antimatroid> just think like attacks can go in any direction
2011-02-08T00:38:07  <antimatroid> with a max dist of 2
2011-02-08T00:38:41  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: still none where option 1 and the iterative version are different?
2011-02-08T00:38:58  <chris_0076> hmm, then wouldn't the Chebyshev metric be better?
2011-02-08T00:39:01  <chris_0076> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance
2011-02-08T00:39:18  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: 1 and 3?
2011-02-08T00:39:20  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-08T00:39:22  <antimatroid> i'm just about to try and find one
2011-02-08T00:39:31  <antimatroid> i found a cool other one, hang on
2011-02-08T00:40:18  <chris_0076> dist = max(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|)
2011-02-08T00:40:50  <antimatroid> not with euclidean
2011-02-08T00:40:57  <antimatroid> that's manhatten
2011-02-08T00:41:06  <chris_0076> no it is Chebyshev
2011-02-08T00:41:08  <chris_0076> ^^
2011-02-08T00:41:19  <antimatroid> whatevs :P
2011-02-08T00:41:22  <chris_0076> in manhatan you add delta x and delta y
2011-02-08T00:41:32  <antimatroid> oh, i see
2011-02-08T00:41:37  <chris_0076> in Chebyshev it is like moving the king on a chess board
2011-02-08T00:41:40  <janzert> manhatten has a distance of 2 for the diagonals
2011-02-08T00:41:44  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: http://i.imgur.com/RYUYS.png bottom left
2011-02-08T00:42:14  <antimatroid> i quite like that distance metric for fights
2011-02-08T00:42:23  <antimatroid> i still don't like option 2 though
2011-02-08T00:42:28  <antimatroid> but i'll play around with that
2011-02-08T00:43:06  <jmcarthur> i'm coding up options 1 and 3 so i can just brute force them to find a case where they are different
2011-02-08T00:43:16  <jmcarthur> well, haven't started yet, but i'm about to
2011-02-08T00:43:37  <antimatroid> with bottom left and option 2 it doesn't make sense for reds extra ant to cause him to lose both
2011-02-08T00:44:13  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's like the ab.c..d...e....f situation
2011-02-08T00:44:23  <antimatroid> yep, but with the 2 fight region
2011-02-08T00:44:27  <antimatroid> i made it off that example
2011-02-08T00:45:11  <jmcarthur> so you are using euclidean distance of 2 in these?
2011-02-08T00:45:25  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-08T00:45:27  <jmcarthur> k
2011-02-08T00:45:32  <jmcarthur> making sure i use the right one
2011-02-08T00:45:35  <antimatroid> i like what chris_0076 suggested
2011-02-08T00:45:50  <antimatroid> diagonals = 1 away for fighting
2011-02-08T00:45:56  <jmcarthur> so it forms a square?
2011-02-08T00:46:29  <antimatroid> well, you have the same fighting squares, but for option 2, bottom left, the red at distance 2 from green would survive
2011-02-08T00:46:29  <jmcarthur> i've suggested many times to do it that way :P
2011-02-08T00:46:42  <jmcarthur> oh i see
2011-02-08T00:46:44  <antimatroid> because green is then 1 from blue
2011-02-08T00:46:48  <janzert> easiest way to think of it is probably as a chess kings move distance
2011-02-08T00:46:59  <antimatroid> but green could still kill red if blue wasn't there
2011-02-08T00:47:17  <jmcarthur> well i'll just run with euclidean for now
2011-02-08T00:49:56  *** AlliedEnvy <AlliedEnvy!~AlliedEnv@adsl-68-90-247-168.dsl.hstntx.swbell.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

2011-02-08T00:51:51  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: check second bottom right
2011-02-08T00:52:15  <antimatroid> if blue comes in with anything but that, i think red is safe, but if blue does that, they take out 4 of reds with 3 of theirs
2011-02-08T00:52:17  <antimatroid> that's cool
2011-02-08T00:52:51  <antimatroid> this is for option 1, with option 2 blue can just walts down the middle with 1 and destroy you
2011-02-08T00:55:46  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'm not convinced dimkadimons isn't just option 1 atm
2011-02-08T00:55:54  <jmcarthur> i think it's not the same
2011-02-08T00:56:10  <jmcarthur> but we'll see
2011-02-08T00:56:13  <antimatroid> i'm trying to come up with an example that comes out differently atm
2011-02-08T00:56:25  <jmcarthur> so am i, once i get these actually implemented
2011-02-08T00:56:38  <jmcarthur> if after brute forcing it i can't find anything, then we can safely declare them the same
2011-02-08T00:56:47  <jmcarthur> but i kind of doubt it
2011-02-08T00:57:57  <antimatroid> i might have one
2011-02-08T00:58:00  <antimatroid> give me a minute
2011-02-08T01:02:18  <antimatroid> yeah, i got one
2011-02-08T01:03:04  <jmcarthur> well fine, make my work for nothing :P
2011-02-08T01:03:22  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-08T01:03:47  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/HkMmT.png
2011-02-08T01:03:52  <antimatroid> bottom left
2011-02-08T01:04:40  <jmcarthur> i see
2011-02-08T01:04:40  <antimatroid> is his not more expensive computationally?
2011-02-08T01:04:46  <jmcarthur> much more
2011-02-08T01:04:48  <Zannick> i don't think we ever really supported scheme
2011-02-08T01:04:57  <antimatroid> i think 1 or 2
2011-02-08T01:05:04  <antimatroid> i think 2 with chris's distance metric
2011-02-08T01:05:07  <antimatroid> i should play with that
2011-02-08T01:05:07  <Zannick> i can find references to three different interpreters...
2011-02-08T01:06:41  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: honestly, even if we were to go with this slower version, i bet option 1 would make a decent enough approximation for reasoning about most situations
2011-02-08T01:07:01  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: yeah, or even if you just ran it on what you can see, i expect it to work most often
2011-02-08T01:07:19  <antimatroid> but i don't see how it's any better? it's slower, almost always comes out the same, and does make it possible that you don't resolve correctly
2011-02-08T01:07:25  <antimatroid> surely option 1 dominates option 3
2011-02-08T01:07:29  <antimatroid> so then it's 1 or 2?
2011-02-08T01:08:02  <jmcarthur> option 1 will tend to kill more ants than option 3 is the main difference i guess
2011-02-08T01:08:26  <antimatroid> very rarely, but sure, i don't think option 3 can kill more
2011-02-08T01:08:29  <jmcarthur> option 2 kills *way* more than either of them though
2011-02-08T01:08:32  <janzert> Zannick: look at the languages.sql file to see a dump of the database table with the languages actually activated
2011-02-08T01:08:34  <antimatroid> but isn't the point of option 2 that it kills more?
2011-02-08T01:08:36  <janzert> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/backend/languages.sql
2011-02-08T01:08:38  <antimatroid> well, one of jeff's points
2011-02-08T01:08:51  <Zannick> janzert: i know
2011-02-08T01:09:02  <jmcarthur> i think the point of jeff liking option 2 is that it makes good micro less powerful
2011-02-08T01:09:04  <Zannick> i wasn't sure how old that was, but it was what i was using
2011-02-08T01:09:23  <janzert> any other languages in the compiler and such weren't actually being used
2011-02-08T01:09:28  <jmcarthur> because jeff thinks that micro is somehow restricted to awesome programmers
2011-02-08T01:09:28  <Zannick> yeah
2011-02-08T01:09:34  <antimatroid> good micro being powerful is one of my biggest interests
2011-02-08T01:09:38  <jmcarthur> me too
2011-02-08T01:09:42  <antimatroid> he and i are conflicted there
2011-02-08T01:10:03  *** dsockwell <dsockwell!~dsockwell@denhac.org> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-08T01:10:10  <jmcarthur> he doesn't care if it interested you because you're one of the elites rather than a newb
2011-02-08T01:10:20  <jmcarthur> and that's going to be his approach to all of us
2011-02-08T01:10:36  <antimatroid> i think the game should be attractive to the more experienced people
2011-02-08T01:10:48  <jmcarthur> as do i
2011-02-08T01:11:05  <jmcarthur> in fact, if i was a newb, i'm pretty sure i would be less attracted to something that doesn't attract the elite
2011-02-08T01:11:15  <antimatroid> sure it needs to be simple enough for someone to get started, but the longer the path for improvement the better imo
2011-02-08T01:11:38  <antimatroid> we're just circlejerking now :)
2011-02-08T01:12:00  <jmcarthur> yeah, not very productive
2011-02-08T01:13:43  <jmcarthur> are there are two-player cases where options 1 and 3 are different?
2011-02-08T01:13:55  <jmcarthur> i might finish this code just to test that if we don't come up with something before i'm done
2011-02-08T01:14:14  <jmcarthur> the two player cases are going to be the very common ones
2011-02-08T01:14:20  <janzert> Zannick: that languages.sql is sligthly outdated it looks like the only one it's missing though is Scala
2011-02-08T01:14:34  <Zannick> ah
2011-02-08T01:14:56  <Zannick> is the command to run it "scala MyBot"? that's all i need
2011-02-08T01:15:07  <janzert> yep
2011-02-08T01:15:14  <Zannick> cool, that's what i have
2011-02-08T01:17:01  <janzert> here's a current dump http://pastebin.ca/2044450
2011-02-08T01:18:09  <jmcarthur> okay i got option1 implemented
2011-02-08T01:18:24  <amstan_> jmcarthur: get it in the repo
2011-02-08T01:18:31  <jmcarthur> amstan_: it's in haskell...
2011-02-08T01:19:20  <Zannick> janzert: thanks
2011-02-08T01:20:05  <antimatroid> i made another post in the ant kill thread
2011-02-08T01:20:44  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i'll try to work out a 2 player instance of it
2011-02-08T01:21:08  <antimatroid> i think you might be able to just chante the green to red and blue
2011-02-08T01:23:13  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: yeah that example can be turned into 2 player and still work,
2011-02-08T01:23:20  <jmcarthur> ah okay
2011-02-08T01:23:29  <jmcarthur> that might be better to include in the graphic then. less misleading
2011-02-08T01:23:36  <antimatroid> i will put both
2011-02-08T01:23:41  <jmcarthur> mmkay
2011-02-08T01:25:38  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/NQoRu.png
2011-02-08T01:25:40  <antimatroid> there you go
2011-02-08T01:27:39  <jmcarthur> okay cool
2011-02-08T01:28:06  <jmcarthur> honestly, my intuition would say that that blue one is dead meat anyway
2011-02-08T01:28:29  <jmcarthur> whereas with option 3 *none* of the blue ants die
2011-02-08T01:29:03  <jmcarthur> then again... there actually appears to be more chances for micro with option 3 because of this sort of thing... assuming you can reason about it effectively
2011-02-08T01:29:16  <jmcarthur> big assumption i guess
2011-02-08T01:30:21  <antimatroid> i very  much think 3 is inferior to 1 with their closeness, i will play around with 2 with chebyshev, but i still love 1
2011-02-08T01:32:34  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i think i missed one that's different with 3 to 1
2011-02-08T01:32:43  <antimatroid> you know the one you corrected me on yesterday?
2011-02-08T01:32:46  <antimatroid> go take a look at that
2011-02-08T01:33:01  <jmcarthur> the zig zaggy one?
2011-02-08T01:33:05  <antimatroid> i think blue loses 2 more of its ants
2011-02-08T01:33:06  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-08T01:33:36  <jmcarthur> i think you are right
2011-02-08T01:33:37  <antimatroid> which means it can kill more than option 1
2011-02-08T01:33:57  <antimatroid> interesting
2011-02-08T01:34:00  <jmcarthur> kind of weird. i guess my intution about it was wrong
2011-02-08T01:34:47  <antimatroid> when implementing it, you'd just decrement a killed ants neighbours enemy count if it's not to die as well
2011-02-08T01:35:01  <antimatroid> still expensive
2011-02-08T01:35:15  <jmcarthur> well, the one i'm doing right now is going to be the naive, inefficient way
2011-02-08T01:35:25  <jmcarthur> because i don't feel like tweaking it forever
2011-02-08T01:35:29  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-08T01:36:10  <jmcarthur> it looks like the naive version of option 3 is roughly twice the code as a fairly naive implementation of option 1
2011-02-08T01:36:57  <jmcarthur> at least based on my guess of how much more code it will take by the time i'm done
2011-02-08T01:37:31  <antimatroid> yeah i would expect that
2011-02-08T01:37:38  <antimatroid> i said in the forum post it's harder to deal with the algorithm
2011-02-08T01:38:12  <jmcarthur> sometimes the more efficient version is actually shorter than the naive version, for some algorithms, though
2011-02-08T01:38:20  <jmcarthur> i just don't want to bother, is all
2011-02-08T01:40:28  <antimatroid> yeah, shorter isn't always easiest
2011-02-08T01:40:40  <jmcarthur> well, looks like i got a bug in it
2011-02-08T01:40:49  <jmcarthur> it's actually not quite twice as long
2011-02-08T01:42:17  <jmcarthur> oh, haha. i implemented option2 by mistake
2011-02-08T01:42:19  <antimatroid> amstan: have you looked at the new ant pics?
2011-02-08T01:42:22  <antimatroid> hahaha
2011-02-08T01:42:24  <jmcarthur> that's hilarious
2011-02-08T01:42:37  <jmcarthur> okay, option3 next :P
2011-02-08T01:42:43  <jmcarthur> i mean... i meant to do that!

2011-02-08T01:49:42  <amstan_> it has to match the one github has of you
2011-02-08T01:50:02  <amstan_> has to be a valid email too
2011-02-08T01:50:10  <amstan_> don't try to attach a non valid email to your account
2011-02-08T01:50:10  <McLeopold1> that's the "git config --global user.name" stuff?
2011-02-08T01:50:10  <antimatroid> McLeopold1: there are more sample images in the forum thread now, also with stuff for dimkadimons option
2011-02-08T01:50:21  <amstan_> yes
2011-02-08T01:50:26  <amstan_> and user.email? i think
2011-02-08T01:50:47  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: I'm going to ignore the battle resolution discussions for a few days.  I want to focus on getting the engine done and a tcp server up.
2011-02-08T01:50:56  <McLeopold1> Yeah, I've set both of those.
2011-02-08T01:51:12  <McLeopold1> is the some other option?
2011-02-08T01:51:24  <amstan_> McLeopold1: do they match the one on github?
2011-02-08T01:51:46  <amstan_> McLeopold1: i see you're appearing both as scott hamilton and mcleopold
2011-02-08T01:51:48  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: okay, option 3 actually took only slightly more code than option 1
2011-02-08T01:51:52  <amstan_> and none of them use the right email
2011-02-08T01:52:06  <jmcarthur> and i implemented it pretty poorly
2011-02-08T01:52:43  <McLeopold1> My first commits were as "Scott Hamilton", but I changed it to try and get the links to work.
2011-02-08T01:53:12  <McLeopold1> Right now i'm "McLeopold" and "mcleopold@..."
2011-02-08T01:53:13  <amstan_> yes.. make sure you have mcl...@gmail.com in github's email addresses
2011-02-08T01:53:19  <McLeopold1> I do
2011-02-08T01:53:32  <amstan_> is it verified?
2011-02-08T01:53:58  <amstan_> McLeopold1: if so.. idk then, try submitting to github support or ask in #github
2011-02-08T01:54:12  <McLeopold1> whoops, I didn't...it was just for the ssh stuff
2011-02-08T01:54:13  <McLeopold1> arg
2011-02-08T01:55:26  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: another reason for me to prefer 1 to 2 :P
2011-02-08T01:55:41  <amstan_> jbroman: python should be compiled as well, 2 reasons: speed at startup, sytax errors are emailed back to the user
2011-02-08T01:55:59  <amstan_> there's a way to make pyc files from py, without actually executing them
2011-02-08T01:58:01  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: option 2 has been the all around worst possible scenario in pretty much every way, so far
2011-02-08T01:58:08  <jmcarthur> IMO
2011-02-08T01:58:30  <antimatroid> i agree :\
2011-02-08T01:58:35  <antimatroid> we just need to convince jeff of that
2011-02-08T02:00:44  <McLeopold1> amstan_: what OS do you use?
2011-02-08T02:00:51  <amstan_> ubuntu
2011-02-08T02:01:07  <McLeopold1> I was thinking I might try that.
2011-02-08T02:01:37  <McLeopold1> Just to get use to the environment we will run the servers on.
2011-02-08T02:01:52  <McLeopold1> probably not much different from fedora or gentoo...
2011-02-08T02:04:06  * antimatroid needs to switch to linux some time
2011-02-08T02:07:43  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: what do you run?
2011-02-08T02:08:04  <antimatroid> xp :P
2011-02-08T02:08:12  <antimatroid> it's done me well
2011-02-08T02:08:15  <McLeopold1> wow, at least i'm on win7
2011-02-08T02:08:22  <antimatroid> i like xp
2011-02-08T02:08:45  <McLeopold1> I do too, but I'm pleased with win7
2011-02-08T02:09:09  <antimatroid> i prefer the extra performance
2011-02-08T02:09:10  <McLeopold1> I just wish I could run make files and have real command line tools
2011-02-08T02:09:18  <jmcarthur> as a sanity check i just verifed that there are no 1 vs 2 scenarios where options 1 and 3 are different. i'm now checking for two teams of two each. i doubt there will be any differences here either
2011-02-08T02:09:29  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm sick of things being harder on windows
2011-02-08T02:09:29  <jmcarthur> this is on a 10x10 grid
2011-02-08T02:09:39  <jmcarthur> hmm, 11x11 actually, because i suck
2011-02-08T02:09:54  <McLeopold1> -1 to 9?
2011-02-08T02:09:56  <antimatroid> haha
2011-02-08T02:09:58  <jmcarthur> 0..10
2011-02-08T02:10:10  <antimatroid> um, what do you mean no 1vs2 scenarios?
2011-02-08T02:10:18  <jmcarthur> A vs. B B
2011-02-08T02:11:57  <jmcarthur> okay i shrunk it down because i got tired of waiting
2011-02-08T02:12:26  <jmcarthur> on a 8x8 grid, there are no scenarios where A A vs. B B end up being different when comparing option 1 to option 3
2011-02-08T02:12:53  <antimatroid> try aaaavbb?
2011-02-08T02:13:00  <antimatroid> actually, there's lots of those
2011-02-08T02:13:05  <antimatroid> because mine can be varied heaps
2011-02-08T02:13:16  <jmcarthur> i'm trying to find the smallest case
2011-02-08T02:13:25  <jmcarthur> i'll try aaa vs bb
2011-02-08T02:14:15  <jmcarthur> okay, it found many differences for aaa vs. bb
2011-02-08T02:14:25  <jmcarthur> let me pick one of these out and diagram it
2011-02-08T02:15:01  <antimatroid> yeah i was about to say, 3x2 is easy
2011-02-08T02:15:51  <jmcarthur> err, i made a mistake actually
2011-02-08T02:16:21  <jmcarthur> yeah, this is an error in my test case generator
2011-02-08T02:16:29  <jmcarthur> not filtering out an invalid scenario
2011-02-08T02:16:33  <antimatroid> i'm less sure about my example
2011-02-08T02:17:12  <antimatroid> a.b.a

2011-02-08T02:17:23  <antimatroid> a . row between*

2011-02-08T02:18:12  <antimatroid> i think that works

2011-02-08T02:18:46  <jmcarthur> i suck at life. i was generating only invalid scenarios instead of only valid ones
2011-02-08T02:18:53  <antimatroid> hehehe
2011-02-08T02:18:54  <jmcarthur> i'm gonna try 2v2 again

2011-02-08T02:23:22  <jmcarthur> mine is much more compact ;)
2011-02-08T02:23:34  <antimatroid> i could make that more compact
2011-02-08T02:23:36  <jmcarthur> abba;a
2011-02-08T02:23:45  <jmcarthur> that's with euclidean
2011-02-08T02:23:48  <jmcarthur> 2
2011-02-08T02:24:00  <jmcarthur> i haven't worked it out yet. it's just been reported to me
2011-02-08T02:24:06  <antimatroid> yeah that looks right
2011-02-08T02:24:18  <antimatroid> i'll draw it up for you
2011-02-08T02:24:57  <jmcarthur> i can do even more compact
2011-02-08T02:25:39  <antimatroid> that situtation above can happen too
2011-02-08T02:25:54  <antimatroid> it'd possible to come up with situations that can't actually happen

2011-02-08T02:34:20  <jmcarthur> just over half of all scenarios in a 2x3 grid with 3 vs. 2 are different between option 1 and option 3, but of course not all those scenarios can actually happen due to the range thing
2011-02-08T02:34:40  <jmcarthur> still, that's interesting i think
2011-02-08T02:34:54  <antimatroid> wait, waht about
2011-02-08T02:34:54  <antimatroid> bab?
2011-02-08T02:35:02  <jmcarthur> that proportion should shrink with larger grids
2011-02-08T02:35:05  <jmcarthur> i think
2011-02-08T02:35:12  <jmcarthur> about about bab?
2011-02-08T02:35:21  <jmcarthur> *what about
2011-02-08T02:35:36  <antimatroid> don't worry, i'm being silly
2011-02-08T02:36:20  <jmcarthur> just trying to get a feel for *how* different they are, that's all
2011-02-08T02:36:30  <jmcarthur> because until now we've felt they were very close to the same
2011-02-08T02:36:37  <antimatroid> it's more different than i thought before
2011-02-08T02:43:27  <antimatroid> i think the sample bots that come with the starter packages should have somewhat varying levels of difficulty this time
2011-02-08T02:43:36  <antimatroid> so people have a local challenge to begin with as well
2011-02-08T02:43:48  <antimatroid> not so difficult that a beginner putting in a decent effort can't exceed the quality though
2011-02-08T02:44:02  <jmcarthur> yeah, a path to improvement that's easy to see without even uploading
2011-02-08T02:44:09  <antimatroid> let's face it, more experienced people aren't going to really care about those anyway
2011-02-08T02:44:48  <jmcarthur> downside to having a tough sample bot is that everybody will be uploading that one, so there will be a tougher curve at the lower end on the server
2011-02-08T02:45:00  <antimatroid> no, you don't release the source for them?
2011-02-08T02:45:03  <antimatroid> that was my intention
2011-02-08T02:45:22  <jmcarthur> huh?
2011-02-08T02:45:39  <antimatroid> just release binary files for some sample bots
2011-02-08T02:45:49  <jmcarthur> of 6,375,600 valid positions on a 5x5 grid for 3 vs. 2, 335844 of them have different results between option 1 and option 3
2011-02-08T02:46:16  <antimatroid> that's quite a lot
2011-02-08T02:46:26  <jmcarthur> about 5%
2011-02-08T02:46:31  <antimatroid> a lot
2011-02-08T02:46:39  <jmcarthur> which is definitely a lot considering how many of those positions are probably not even fights
2011-02-08T02:46:57  <jmcarthur> not big ones involving all players at least
2011-02-08T02:47:07  <jmcarthur> s/players/ants/
2011-02-08T02:47:08  <antimatroid> can you count what proportion had 1 kill more than 3?
2011-02-08T02:47:11  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@245.250-50-210.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-08T02:47:31  <jmcarthur> would be some work
2011-02-08T02:47:42  <antimatroid> not really important
2011-02-08T02:47:43  <jmcarthur> you mean where 1 ant killed more than 3?
2011-02-08T02:47:54  <antimatroid> i'm more interested in what behaviour each rule encourages than overall deaths
2011-02-08T02:47:58  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-08T02:48:08  <antimatroid> where option 1 killed more than option 3/vice versa
2011-02-08T02:48:14  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-08T02:48:24  <jmcarthur> i can do that pretty easily
2011-02-08T02:48:51  <antimatroid> there are now 4 options :\
2011-02-08T02:48:57  <jmcarthur> oh?
2011-02-08T02:49:00  <antimatroid> if we count the two metrics for option 2
2011-02-08T02:49:04  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-02-08T02:49:27  <antimatroid> i think pick between 1 and 3 and each of the two's, then pick between those
2011-02-08T02:49:32  <antimatroid> how to pick, bleh
2011-02-08T02:50:09  <antimatroid> actually, i have no idea how the second 2 option workds yet
2011-02-08T02:52:14  <jmcarthur> in 198576 of those scenarios, option 1 killed more than option 3
2011-02-08T02:52:23  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-08T02:52:25  <jmcarthur> wrong
2011-02-08T02:52:28  <jmcarthur> backward
2011-02-08T02:52:37  <jmcarthur> option 3 killed more than option 1 in that many
2011-02-08T02:53:36  <jmcarthur> interesting
2011-02-08T02:54:18  <antimatroid> yeah, didn't expect that
2011-02-08T02:54:35  <jmcarthur> that means that option 3 actually killed more in about 60% of the cases where they were different
2011-02-08T02:54:58  <jmcarthur> 137268 where option 1 killed more
2011-02-08T02:55:43  <antimatroid> so option 3 can cause big changes in kill ratio?
2011-02-08T02:55:51  <jmcarthur> that means there were no cases where option 1 killed ant A but not ant B but option 3 killed ant B but not ant A
2011-02-08T02:56:12  <jmcarthur> their kills always overlapped, but one is still not a subset of the other in every case
2011-02-08T02:56:48  <antimatroid> largest kill ratio!
2011-02-08T02:56:50  <antimatroid> :P
2011-02-08T02:56:51  <antimatroid> go
2011-02-08T02:57:05  <antimatroid> maybe even save the example
2011-02-08T02:57:07  <antimatroid> i'd be keen to see it
2011-02-08T02:58:04  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-02-08T02:58:36  <jmcarthur> largest absolute kill ratio or largest difference between option 1 and option 3?
2011-02-08T03:00:53  <antimatroid> both? :P
2011-02-08T03:01:44  <antimatroid> i think i got another one wrong
2011-02-08T03:02:12  <antimatroid> oh shit, i think you can block the 3 passage with 3
2011-02-08T03:02:25  <jmcarthur> but not with 1?
2011-02-08T03:02:40  <antimatroid> not with 1
2011-02-08T03:02:48  <antimatroid> go to 3rd row from bottom, right side
2011-02-08T03:02:51  <antimatroid> it's wrong atm
2011-02-08T03:02:57  <antimatroid> i think red keeps all their ants with option 3?
2011-02-08T03:03:08  <antimatroid> you remove the blue 4, then each red has 1 blue enemy?
2011-02-08T03:03:34  <jmcarthur> which distance metric?
2011-02-08T03:03:53  <antimatroid> what do you mean? it's the 2 diamond
2011-02-08T03:03:54  <antimatroid> they all are
2011-02-08T03:04:05  <jmcarthur> i thought you said you were using euclidean
2011-02-08T03:04:10  <antimatroid> that's for option 2
2011-02-08T03:04:13  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-02-08T03:04:15  <antimatroid> hence the rt(2)'s
2011-02-08T03:04:17  <jmcarthur> then i'm doing all these wrong
2011-02-08T03:04:35  <antimatroid> there shouldn't be a difference with manhatten and euclidean for 1 and 3?
2011-02-08T03:04:44  <jmcarthur> not sure
2011-02-08T03:04:45  <antimatroid> the fight region is the same, and that's all it determines?
2011-02-08T03:05:10  <jmcarthur> okay, none of these scenarios varied by more than 2 kills, and 137268 of them varies by exactly 2 kills
2011-02-08T03:05:14  <jmcarthur> *varied
2011-02-08T03:05:23  <jmcarthur> i guess so
2011-02-08T03:05:31  <antimatroid> i think you're safe on that one
2011-02-08T03:05:33  <jmcarthur> it's a diamond with 2 euclidean?
2011-02-08T03:05:38  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-02-08T03:05:38  <jmcarthur> i hadn't thought about it
2011-02-08T03:05:40  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-02-08T03:05:46  <antimatroid> i realised that with snowman game
2011-02-08T03:05:52  <antimatroid> if you go larger it isn't
2011-02-08T03:06:29  <antimatroid> but.. is that bad that they can block that passage?
2011-02-08T03:06:49  <jmcarthur> okay, so the number of cases where the difference was exactly 2 kills is exactly the same as the number of cases where option 1 had more kills than option 3. i doubt that's a coincidence
2011-02-08T03:07:20  <jmcarthur> that's a pretty big passage to be blocking
2011-02-08T03:07:28  <jmcarthur> are you sure that would be impenetrable?
2011-02-08T03:07:32  <antimatroid> look at it
2011-02-08T03:07:37  <antimatroid> you can't send ants in there to break it
2011-02-08T03:07:44  <antimatroid> any other variation and they all die straight up
2011-02-08T03:07:52  <antimatroid> it would be an awesome trap with option 1
2011-02-08T03:08:12  <jmcarthur> yeah i think you're right
2011-02-08T03:08:49  <jmcarthur> with option 1 it's breakable and with option 3 it's not
2011-02-08T03:10:07  <antimatroid> i think you can even flow your ants through that hole and remain stable
2011-02-08T03:10:23  <antimatroid> it's like a one way portal
2011-02-08T03:10:27  <antimatroid> that's actually kind of awesome
2011-02-08T03:10:46  <antimatroid> 2 way if you're a friend
2011-02-08T03:12:14  <jmcarthur> it's neat, but probably bad for the contest anyway :(
2011-02-08T03:12:30  <jmcarthur> the existence of one that large hints that there may be an even larger one
2011-02-08T03:12:40  <antimatroid> i don't think so
2011-02-08T03:12:46  <antimatroid> i could be wrong
2011-02-08T03:12:52  <antimatroid> i have been over and over again

2011-02-08T03:18:00  <jmcarthur> option 3:   A----;-----;-A---
2011-02-08T03:18:15  <antimatroid> acutally, i think they can block the 4 passage too
2011-02-08T03:18:21  <antimatroid> rule 3 is definitely out
2011-02-08T03:18:25  <jmcarthur> i guess we already had an even smaller case for that
2011-02-08T03:18:36  <antimatroid> oh, maybe they can't, hang on
2011-02-08T03:18:56  <jmcarthur> i'm not sure. i thought about the blocking a bit more and i don't think it should be possible to block any larger
2011-02-08T03:19:30  <jmcarthur> ah, no we didn't have a simpler case already for option 3 killing more than option 1
2011-02-08T03:19:57  <jmcarthur> so there's a simpler one than the one we had already (which was a 5v5)
2011-02-08T03:20:24  <antimatroid> yeah, pretty sure they can block 4
2011-02-08T03:20:28  <jmcarthur> i guess the corridor made a 3v4 one

2011-02-08T03:21:11  <antimatroid> Wa.bb.aW
2011-02-08T03:21:11  <antimatroid> W.aaaa.W
2011-02-08T03:21:18  <jmcarthur> i'm pretty convinced against option 3 now
2011-02-08T03:21:53  <antimatroid> oh wait, they could take out some of your things there
2011-02-08T03:21:57  <antimatroid> it's not trivial to block it
2011-02-08T03:22:59  <antimatroid> bleh, i am going around in circles, move middle a squares down and it may be blocked
2011-02-08T03:23:19  <Zannick> ugh
2011-02-08T03:23:53  <janzert> even if it takes active moves to do it, I would guess if it can be done on a 4 wide corridor it can be done for any width corridor?
2011-02-08T03:24:47  <antimatroid> http://i.imgur.com/5X6jq.png
2011-02-08T03:24:50  <antimatroid> i think that's blocked
2011-02-08T03:24:53  <janzert> or linear space, the only question to form an impenetrable fortress then is to find a way to turn a corner
2011-02-08T03:25:11  <antimatroid> janzert: you might be right
2011-02-08T03:26:18  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: stick one blue ant to the immediate right of the leftmost red ant and stick another blue ant above that one
2011-02-08T03:26:40  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: an ant couldn't get that close
2011-02-08T03:26:58  <jmcarthur> okay, get rid of the lower blue ant then
2011-02-08T03:27:02  <jmcarthur> ah i see
2011-02-08T03:27:04  <jmcarthur> nevermind
2011-02-08T03:27:13  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's blocked
2011-02-08T03:27:23  <antimatroid> i think you can do that for any size given space
2011-02-08T03:27:32  <antimatroid> it could turn into a game of blocking off large regions
2011-02-08T03:27:35  <antimatroid> option 3 is out
2011-02-08T03:28:46  <jmcarthur> are we sure option 1 is fine for this one?
2011-02-08T03:28:51  <antimatroid> although it would be fun to hole someone into a corridor from both ends
2011-02-08T03:29:00  <jmcarthur> i might just be tired, but i'm not thinking of how to attackit
2011-02-08T03:29:03  <jmcarthur> *attack it
2011-02-08T03:29:07  <jmcarthur> i really should head to bead
2011-02-08T03:29:09  <jmcarthur> *bed
2011-02-08T03:29:11  <jmcarthur> gah
2011-02-08T03:29:20  <antimatroid> hmm, i'll find something that breaks it
2011-02-08T03:30:12  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: you can take out red's edge pieces
2011-02-08T03:30:24  <antimatroid> put blue ones diagonally above each
2011-02-08T03:30:42  <antimatroid> so they can block it pretty well, but it's breakable
2011-02-08T03:30:51  <jmcarthur> i'm not seeing it
2011-02-08T03:30:57  <antimatroid> hang on, i'll do the numbers
2011-02-08T03:31:11  <jmcarthur> ah i see one
2011-02-08T03:32:12  <jmcarthur> it takes two ants to kill each side ant
2011-02-08T03:32:21  <jmcarthur> then you go in with more to take the rest
2011-02-08T03:32:28  <antimatroid> oh, maybe
2011-02-08T03:32:46  <antimatroid> i think that's blocked
2011-02-08T03:32:48  <antimatroid> crud
2011-02-08T03:32:51  <jmcarthur> no no
2011-02-08T03:33:02  <jmcarthur> bah, i'll just run it through my algorithm and be sure :P

2011-02-08T05:15:48  <antimatroid> i think 3 is dead
2011-02-08T05:15:52  <janzert> option 3
2011-02-08T05:15:55  <janzert> yeah
2011-02-08T05:16:13  <antimatroid> i still think 1 would be way cooler than 2
2011-02-08T05:16:40  <antimatroid> either option is going to require caring about the micro side, but 1 makes it better for people who do it well
2011-02-08T05:16:57  <antimatroid> as opposed to those that don't just suck
2011-02-08T05:21:11  <janzert> did anyone take a serious look at one with distance just the 8 adjacent squares
2011-02-08T05:21:19  <janzert> option 1 that is
2011-02-08T05:23:16  <antimatroid> i liked the idea that enemy ants can never land in the same square
2011-02-08T05:23:25  <antimatroid> i haven't really looked at it though
2011-02-08T05:23:41  <janzert> the above wouldn't allow them to would it?
2011-02-08T05:23:46  <antimatroid> i like chris_0076's idea to use chebyshev metric for option 2
2011-02-08T05:24:01  <janzert> oops, I confused option 2 and 1
2011-02-08T05:24:21  <antimatroid> if you do the 8, you can have a.b and them walk into each other
2011-02-08T05:24:22  <janzert> I meant option 2 with chebyshev distance 1 above
2011-02-08T05:24:30  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-02-08T05:24:31  <janzert> ahh, yeah
2011-02-08T05:24:36  <antimatroid> i plan to play around with that
2011-02-08T05:25:27  <janzert> hmm, so distance 1 is too small and distance 2 starts to seem rather large
2011-02-08T05:25:58  <janzert> maybe it would still work out though
2011-02-08T05:26:33  <antimatroid> i don't think it's too bad, if you consider manhatten metric with option 1
2011-02-08T05:26:37  <antimatroid> it's all just the 2 circle
2011-02-08T05:26:47  <antimatroid> it's the same with euclidean metric too
2011-02-08T05:26:50  <janzert> right, I meant the chebyshev
2011-02-08T05:27:07  <antimatroid> yeah, i wouldn't necessarily set d=2
2011-02-08T05:27:17  <antimatroid> give the diamon, but use chebyshev as distance metric
2011-02-08T05:27:39  <antimatroid> it just changes ajcant to d=1 instead of rt2
2011-02-08T05:28:03  <janzert> ahh, so they only interact within the diamond but distance measurement is the chebyshev
2011-02-08T05:28:09  <janzert> yeah, that might work nice
2011-02-08T05:28:22  <antimatroid> that way you can fight around you or long range if necessary
2011-02-08T05:28:31  <antimatroid> but only long range in your movement direction
2011-02-08T05:28:37  <antimatroid> it sort of comes out alright explanation wise
2011-02-08T05:28:45  <janzert> yeah
2011-02-08T05:30:09  <antimatroid> i'm implementing an iterateState function in my simple bot now so i can just feed it a game state to iterate for me
2011-02-08T05:30:20  <antimatroid> i'm doing option 1, but i will do 2 after
2011-02-08T05:41:43  <antimatroid> janzert: another issue the extra fighting region presents is fighting through walls
2011-02-08T05:41:56  <antimatroid> although diagonal also had the issue of fighting through a crack
2011-02-08T05:42:22  <antimatroid> one "explanation" is to say walls aren't high enough to block fighting, only movement
2011-02-08T05:42:25  <janzert> yeah, I thought of that but I don't think it'll be a big problem
2011-02-08T05:42:36  <antimatroid> it might make it cool if you can fight through the walls
2011-02-08T05:42:39  <janzert> or just say, hey it's a game :P
2011-02-08T05:42:57  <antimatroid> that's what i would do, but i've been told an explanation is important
2011-02-08T05:43:13  <antimatroid> i'd be happy saying it's a game on a graph with blah blah blah :P
2011-02-08T05:43:35  <janzert> I guess I think the whole ants thing is pretty thin at this point anyway so...
2011-02-08T05:43:55  <antimatroid> nah, ant colonies fighting for land area and resources for growing
2011-02-08T05:44:04  <antimatroid> that makes perfect sense :\
2011-02-08T05:44:26  <antimatroid> i especially like the idea of not knowing how many other colonies there are
2011-02-08T05:44:33  <janzert> with no hole and a central brain and.. :P
2011-02-08T05:44:35  <antimatroid> but that may be unavoidable
2011-02-08T05:44:58  <antimatroid> well.. the starting square could be an ants hole, and if another ant lands on it, kills that plays ants, all of them
2011-02-08T05:45:03  <antimatroid> but i don't think people will like that
2011-02-08T05:45:20  <antimatroid> actually, manages to kill the hole with the same rules?
2011-02-08T05:45:24  <antimatroid> and the hole can't move
2011-02-08T05:45:34  <janzert> but what advantage does the hole give?
2011-02-08T05:45:41  <antimatroid> your survival?
2011-02-08T05:45:54  <antimatroid> ants could spawn there on a turn that you don't have an ant on it
2011-02-08T05:46:07  <antimatroid> and you get a counter for amount of food squares you claimed
2011-02-08T05:46:12  <antimatroid> but it's going back to my game then
2011-02-08T05:46:22  <janzert> that would certainly change the nature of the game yeah
2011-02-08T05:46:38  <antimatroid> i think this game as is could be quite cool
2011-02-08T05:46:49  <antimatroid> i just think it needs option 1 to make the micro more awesome
2011-02-08T05:46:51  <janzert> not that it would necessarily be bad, but it's a lot different than what people are looking at now
2011-02-08T05:47:10  <antimatroid> and i've not seen so much agreement over the general game until now
2011-02-08T05:47:17  <antimatroid> it might be best to go with where we're at
2011-02-08T05:48:04  <janzert> probably
2011-02-08T05:50:10  <antimatroid> i'm pretty iffy about the non-symmetric maps idea
2011-02-08T05:50:41  <antimatroid> i like that at least with the maps i have, if two players come across each other at the start, it's not going to be on symmetrical terms
2011-02-08T05:50:48  <antimatroid> well, very unlikely
2011-02-08T05:50:48  <janzert> yeah, I really like the idea in theory. But I don't think it's going to work in practice like Jeff thinks it will
2011-02-08T05:51:27  <janzert> if he can actually pull it off though then great
2011-02-08T05:51:51  <antimatroid> i think both should be done initially and results compared
2011-02-08T05:51:59  <antimatroid> and generally look at how it goes
2011-02-08T05:52:01  <janzert> I think the noise and feedback between map rating and player rating is going to be too much though
2011-02-08T05:52:11  <antimatroid> that and the number of games needed
2011-02-08T05:52:18  <janzert> yep
2011-02-08T05:52:36  <antimatroid> tcp could help the games thing maybe
2011-02-08T05:53:23  <janzert> possibly, but you know even less about player strengths there
2011-02-08T05:53:58  <janzert> although I don't think he was planning to try and take player strength into account in the calculation at all
2011-02-08T05:54:12  <janzert> and just hope that it averaged out I guess
2011-02-08T05:55:43  <antimatroid> i don't think it'd work
2011-02-08T05:55:47  <antimatroid> but i'm happy to try
2011-02-08T05:55:51  <antimatroid> oh well

2011-02-08T08:49:36  <Error323> I see
2011-02-08T08:49:41  <antimatroid> as in people are in the process of making official stuff for this
2011-02-08T08:49:44  <Error323> would be a waste of a lot of work indeed.
2011-02-08T08:52:35  <antimatroid> i hated the game until we moved away from 1:1 battle resolution
2011-02-08T08:52:46  <antimatroid> now i think it will be quite cool
2011-02-08T08:53:30  <Error323> is there already an engine and webbased visualizer?
2011-02-08T08:54:03  <antimatroid> there's an old engine j3camero wrote (i think, maybe amstan), but mcleopold is working on one
2011-02-08T08:54:12  <antimatroid> i think he plans to get a tcp server going soon for testing on

2011-02-08T16:19:01  <McLeopold1> janzert: I thought of something we could do for the scoring.
2011-02-08T16:19:28  <McLeopold1> It would ensure the last bot standing gets the win, or a least make no incentive for keeping the game going.
2011-02-08T16:20:02  <McLeopold1> If the amount of food to be spawned is known, then when there is 1 bot left, they get that amount added to their score.
2011-02-08T16:20:36  <McLeopold1> At 1000 turns, if you win at turn 750, you get a 250 point bonus, assuming 1 food spawned per turn.
2011-02-08T16:21:12  <McLeopold1> Letting someone live in a corner will only take away points if food spawns near them.
2011-02-08T16:21:43  <McLeopold1> So there should be no incentive to not end the game for anyone.
2011-02-08T16:22:11  <McLeopold1> And dumb bots with survival luck don't get credit.

2011-02-08T16:32:12  <McLeopold1> jmcarthur: another battle resolution idea: ants only die when they are on the same square as other ants (including self)
2011-02-08T16:32:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold1: so just require them to run into each other?
2011-02-08T16:32:47  <McLeopold1> yep
2011-02-08T16:32:53  <McLeopold1> a bot bot can ensure 1:1
2011-02-08T16:32:58  <jmcarthur> what about overshooting?
2011-02-08T16:33:06  <jmcarthur> ab, a moves right and b moves left
2011-02-08T16:33:15  <McLeopold1> kill em
2011-02-08T16:33:29  <jmcarthur> alright, so like my stratego rules
2011-02-08T16:34:01  <jmcarthur> that would certainly be 1:1 and fair, but i can't say it sounds very... compelling :)
2011-02-08T16:35:42  <jmcarthur> it makes blocking impossible too, obviously
2011-02-08T16:36:05  <jmcarthur> there's pretty much no real micro there except for the occasional game of chase
2011-02-08T16:36:12  <McLeopold1> yeah, now let's say an ant is really a 2x2 square
2011-02-08T16:36:21  <McLeopold1> or, a 3x3
2011-02-08T16:36:33  *** Meatkat <Meatkat!~bovard@217.113.66.228> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2011-02-08T16:36:52  <McLeopold1> then, we are back to, if in range, kill ant, and not trying to maintain 1:1 with shorter distance requirements
2011-02-08T16:37:02  <McLeopold1> a player can still ensure 1:1
2011-02-08T16:37:06  <jmcarthur> the shorter distance requirements were always silly
2011-02-08T16:37:09  <McLeopold1> just keep yourself spaced
2011-02-08T16:37:11  <jmcarthur> this is basically just kill all ants in range
2011-02-08T16:37:23  <McLeopold1> yes, but without serial numbers
2011-02-08T16:37:33  <jmcarthur> well right, because it's not actually 1:1
2011-02-08T16:37:45  <McLeopold1> no, but a bot can ensure 1:1
2011-02-08T16:37:53  <jmcarthur> given that they have the space to move about
2011-02-08T16:37:56  <McLeopold1> without a "CS degree"
2011-02-08T16:38:09  <jmcarthur> if they are cornered it's still not going to be 1:1 necessarily
2011-02-08T16:38:31  <McLeopold1> no
2011-02-08T16:38:40  <McLeopold1> locally deterministic
2011-02-08T16:38:52  <McLeopold1> If jeff will accept it
2011-02-08T16:39:05  <jmcarthur> i'm pretty sure we had mentioned it before
2011-02-08T16:39:09  <jmcarthur> maybe not in front of jeff
2011-02-08T16:39:29  <McLeopold1> he was against it at first
2011-02-08T16:39:43  <jmcarthur> anyway, i'm not a fan just because i really want micro, but it beats the distance sorting thing
2011-02-08T16:39:50  <McLeopold1> But, I think he made a statement where he thought it was a good idea.
2011-02-08T16:40:08  <McLeopold1> You get some micro, just not formations
2011-02-08T16:40:51  <jmcarthur> well, you get basically the same kind of micro as you get with the distance one: keep your ants spaced out, attack with one at a time, play chicken
2011-02-08T16:40:52  <McLeopold1> He also wants range attacks to discourage chasing and breaking through behind lines.
2011-02-08T16:41:48  <McLeopold1> But, I think those are actually fun *macro* strategies.
2011-02-08T16:41:50  <jmcarthur> how do range attacks discourage those?
2011-02-08T16:42:16  <jmcarthur> yes, i agree, but i don't want the game to be solely macro
2011-02-08T16:42:16  <McLeopold1> you can't sneak past an ant in a corridor if he has a range 3 attack.
2011-02-08T16:42:39  <McLeopold1> less ants to "block" a chokepoint
2011-02-08T16:42:56  <jmcarthur> err
2011-02-08T16:43:01  <McLeopold1> also, read above for my scoring idea
2011-02-08T16:43:13  <McLeopold1> last bot standing gets food bonus
2011-02-08T16:43:21  <jmcarthur> less ants to get *a* kill in a chokepoint, sure
2011-02-08T16:44:05  <jmcarthur> the scoring idea sounds good at first glance

2011-02-08T18:12:05  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-08T18:12:22  <jmcarthur> the whole point of the rules, to me, is to create some emergent complexity anyway
2011-02-08T18:12:33  <jmcarthur> otherwise it's not really an AI competition at all
2011-02-08T18:12:38  <McLeopold> even with our "simple" ants, I can imagine a lot of questions that will be hard to answer.
2011-02-08T18:14:15  <antimatroid> McLeopold: such as?
2011-02-08T18:14:42  <antimatroid> i don't like that "colliding ants die" rule, i'm with jmcarthur, i want interesting micro, and i think formations would be awesome to watch
2011-02-08T18:15:14  <antimatroid> i've got all 4 options implemented (fairly naively) in my bot code, so I can throw input at it and get the result of iterating the state
2011-02-08T18:23:13  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I think it would be to hard to explain recursive collision resolution to the newbs.  It's easier to kill their ants and slap their hands.
2011-02-08T18:23:47  <McLeopold> With range attacks, enemy ants can't collide.
2011-02-08T18:23:53  <antimatroid> McLeopold: that's one of the reasons i like option 1 to 2
2011-02-08T18:24:35  <antimatroid> i actually found each algorithm was pretty easy to do naively
2011-02-08T18:24:42  <antimatroid> option 2 code might have even been the shortest
2011-02-08T18:24:59  <McLeopold> honestly, I think we have "the one and only option" and "wish #1" and "wish #2"
2011-02-08T18:25:22  <antimatroid> what's "the one and only option"?
2011-02-08T18:25:41  <McLeopold> range attacks, attempt 1:1 ratio
2011-02-08T18:25:51  <antimatroid> i think that's shit personally
2011-02-08T18:26:14  <antimatroid> i only got interested in this game once we moved away from 1:1 and introduced "attack" in my ants version so it wasn't also
2011-02-08T18:26:36  <antimatroid> without micro being interesting, it's boring and doesn't leave interesting battles
2011-02-08T18:27:24  <McLeopold> If we can trivially break the game, then jeff will listen, but probably not until then
2011-02-08T18:28:13  <McLeopold> so, write an unstoppable bot with range attacks
2011-02-08T18:28:59  <antimatroid> the visualiser is easy as to make with ranged attacks
2011-02-08T18:29:14  <antimatroid> did you see my very rough proposal for passing info to it?
2011-02-08T18:30:08  <antimatroid> atm i'm imagining "pixels" sliding between squares each turn, then fading kills/spawns/food removal
2011-02-08T18:30:22  <antimatroid> if ants are going into the same square, that gets trickier and less visually appealing

2011-02-08T18:30:39  <antimatroid> and it's complicated for killing ants that are passing through the same edge
2011-02-08T18:31:02  <antimatroid> ideally you'd want to visualise that as the two ants sliding off their square to die in a given direction
2011-02-08T18:31:28  <McLeopold> I too want to see dead ants.
2011-02-08T18:31:39  <antimatroid> on the visualiser?
2011-02-08T18:31:49  <antimatroid> isn't it enough to see them fade?
2011-02-08T18:31:55  <McLeopold> ?!%*.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
2011-02-08T18:32:11  <antimatroid> and what if there's more than one ant landing in a square? then how do you show a "dead" ant? there's many
2011-02-08T18:32:13  <McLeopold> That's my current set of characters for the map matrix
2011-02-08T18:32:33  <McLeopold> ?=unseen, !=dead ant, %=wall/water, *=food, .=open land
2011-02-08T18:32:40  <McLeopold> no more hills
2011-02-08T18:32:45  <antimatroid> i think allowing attack range ==2 with manhatten makes it a lot easier, and blocking passageways etc. is more complicated
2011-02-08T18:33:15  <McLeopold> So, as for sliding ants, that would be nice, but it is a lot of data to try and save for the visualizer.
2011-02-08T18:33:39  <antimatroid> McLeopold: check the input i proposed, i don't think it is
2011-02-08T18:33:41  <McLeopold> we'd have to echo all ant moves to every player
2011-02-08T18:33:49  <McLeopold> where do I check?
2011-02-08T18:33:52  <McLeopold> etherpad?
2011-02-08T18:33:53  <antimatroid> etherpad
2011-02-08T18:34:36  <antimatroid> you basically echo the moves to the visualiser, along with information at the end about spawning/killing squares, which is done with fading
2011-02-08T18:35:45  <antimatroid> surely it'd be less info than sent for planet wars?
2011-02-08T18:36:17  <antimatroid> McLeopold: can i replace the io at the top?
2011-02-08T18:36:27  <antimatroid> i'll change X to %, i wanted to do something like that anyway
2011-02-08T18:36:27  <McLeopold> I think it might be more

2011-02-08T18:36:41  <McLeopold> keep letters for players
2011-02-08T18:36:45  <antimatroid> yep
2011-02-08T18:36:51  <antimatroid> you can make a moved players value capital too
2011-02-08T18:36:54  <antimatroid> etc. etc.
2011-02-08T18:37:04  <McLeopold> you need to give info about revealed spots too
2011-02-08T18:37:13  <antimatroid> not to the visualiser?
2011-02-08T18:37:30  <antimatroid> wait, what?
2011-02-08T18:37:33  <McLeopold> but, to the players
2011-02-08T18:37:47  <McLeopold> fog of war
2011-02-08T18:38:06  <j3camero> Just catching up on the IRC. I would support "kill all ants that are within range of an enemy ant" rule. It would produce some interesting micro where you try to kill two or three of their ants at a time using only one of your ants. It would be pretty hard to exploit that death rule to consistently get odds that are much better than 1:1.
2011-02-08T18:38:30  <j3camero> I think that was a suggestion just above, not sure if I read that right.
2011-02-08T18:38:49  <McLeopold> j3camero: I thought you were against micro that allowed 3:1 deaths?
2011-02-08T18:38:52  <antimatroid> hmmm, it still encourages fighting with just 1 ant

2011-02-08T18:39:30  <antimatroid> j3camero: what's not awesome about watching ants try to move themselves into formations for offense?
2011-02-08T18:39:34  <McLeopold> j3camero: so you are okay with offensive micro, but not defensive micro?
2011-02-08T18:39:54  <antimatroid> it'd be a little bit like watching game of life
2011-02-08T18:39:56  <j3camero> McLeopold: 3:1 deaths are technically possible with the suicide bomber death rule, but would be very rare. Especially with simultaneous moves, it would be pretty hard to do consistently. In any typical battle it would be hard to do much better than 1:1.
2011-02-08T18:40:22  <antimatroid> j3camero: we're at complete odds about whether deviating from 1:1 is good i think
2011-02-08T18:40:42  <McLeopold> j3camero: also, I'm in the middle of massive changes to the engine I wrote.
2011-02-08T18:40:57  <antimatroid> McLeopold: just make yourself the official map gen person already :P
2011-02-08T18:41:00  <McLeopold> I think I'm going to get a bot that processes stdin by today
2011-02-08T18:41:28  *** Mathnerd314 <Mathnerd314!~mathnerd3@128.198.97.174> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-08T18:41:35  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I plan to compete with you for map gen guru.  You won the last round. ;)
2011-02-08T18:41:44  <antimatroid> McLeopold: bring it :P
2011-02-08T18:41:51  <j3camero> Sounds god guys.
2011-02-08T18:41:57  <antimatroid> i'm hoping lots of people will play around with maps and early
2011-02-08T18:42:02  <McLeopold> interesting typo...
2011-02-08T18:42:08  <j3camero> I think there will be room for several map gens this time around. Why not?
2011-02-08T18:42:08  *** Apophis <Apophis!~apophis@80-219-211-230.dclient.hispeed.ch> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-02-08T18:42:17  <antimatroid> j3camero: i'd say go with one at the end
2011-02-08T18:42:28  <antimatroid> i think it's important to keeps things clear and simple at the end
2011-02-08T18:42:33  <McLeopold> j3camero: I think your right.  Pure random will be too noisy.  There are so many options.
2011-02-08T18:43:02  <antimatroid> i had an idea for a map gen, just send tron like snakes randomly around the map until you have filled enough walls?
2011-02-08T18:43:16  <antimatroid> would encourage "walls" more i think?
2011-02-08T18:43:34  <McLeopold> did you see my first draft at one?
2011-02-08T18:43:40  <antimatroid> nope
2011-02-08T18:44:07  <McLeopold> start with all walls, the carve out symmetric "rooms".  ensure a path to all starting ants
2011-02-08T18:44:25  <antimatroid> j3camero: have you seen the pictures of resolutions in the forums?
2011-02-08T18:44:31  <j3camero> I have seen some of antimatroid's maps. They are cool I think people will like them. They are very mazelike. Perhaps we can also generate some that are like islands joined by narrow land bridges.
2011-02-08T18:44:32  <McLeopold> Although it crashes 50% of the time.
2011-02-08T18:44:59  <antimatroid> my engine? was that just on codepad? that times out, otherwise it shouldn't
2011-02-08T18:45:01  <McLeopold> j3camero: that's what my first attempt was trying to do
2011-02-08T18:45:04  <antimatroid> but it was a very rough draft anyway
2011-02-08T18:45:25  <antimatroid> j3camero: while mine are symmetric, coming across another player wont be on symmetrical terms, i like that and think you will?
2011-02-08T18:45:55  <j3camero> You played much Starcraft? You know The Hunters? That's sort of my concept for maps. http://www.teamliquid.net/tlpd/images/maps/173_Hunters.jpg
2011-02-08T18:46:02  <antimatroid> never played it
2011-02-08T18:46:06  <McLeopold> I *hate* that map...
2011-02-08T18:46:23  <McLeopold> but yeah
2011-02-08T18:46:26  <j3camero> antimatroid: I think we should explore non-symmetric maps, but there's no reason why we should make a rule against them. Of course we should use your map gen.
2011-02-08T18:46:36  <McLeopold> Actually, we could use the planet wars generator for this.
2011-02-08T18:46:37  <antimatroid> i think it'd be better to focus on maps once an engine is running
2011-02-08T18:47:02  <j3camero> Sorry, there is no reason we should make a rule against symmetric maps is what I meant.
2011-02-08T18:47:09  <McLeopold> Just make the planets a little bigger, draw some paths if they are close enough, convert to png.
2011-02-08T18:47:20  <antimatroid> j3camero: i'm happy to try the non-symmetric maps idea, it sounds cool, but i don't see it working
2011-02-08T18:47:33  <Zannick> are we still using pngs as maps? :(
2011-02-08T18:47:39  <antimatroid> Zannick: no
2011-02-08T18:47:42  <antimatroid> i don't think anyway
2011-02-08T18:47:42  <McLeopold> I'm supporting both right now.
2011-02-08T18:47:46  <Zannick> ah
2011-02-08T18:47:51  <Zannick> that's good
2011-02-08T18:47:51  <j3camero> We will get lots of feedback from the contestants on maps once we launch, so there will be time to zero in on what people are finding most interesting.
2011-02-08T18:48:00  <McLeopold> It's easier to "draw" a png just to test stuff out.
2011-02-08T18:48:08  <antimatroid> i'm all about battle resolution atm
2011-02-08T18:48:12  <McLeopold> I think the community would enjoy that functionality too.
2011-02-08T18:48:19  <j3camero> Yeah PNGs are a terrible way to store maps. I just did that because I was lazy when I was writing a throw-away ants simulator.
2011-02-08T18:48:21  <antimatroid> and i'm still very much in favour of option 1, but i'd prefer 2 to the new thing mcleopold mentione
2011-02-08T18:48:28  <antimatroid> or what j3camero just mentioned
2011-02-08T18:49:17  <antimatroid> someone needs to make an "ascii paint" program, where you can pick the character to draw with and make different shapes with it on a lattice canvas
2011-02-08T18:49:22  <antimatroid> that'd be sweet for making maps in
2011-02-08T18:49:45  <j3camero> Wow why doesn't that exist?
2011-02-08T18:49:48  <j3camero> Or does it?
2011-02-08T18:49:50  <McLeopold> ant_map can be used as a png2txt converter right now
2011-02-08T18:49:50  <antimatroid> it probably does
2011-02-08T18:50:01  <McLeopold> I can make it go the other way too.
2011-02-08T18:50:08  <antimatroid> yeah, other way would be good
2011-02-08T18:50:45  <j3camero> Okay I have to drill through some work that I promised I would do for people, so I am going into "ignore distracting IRC mode". I'll be back in a while to make some headway on engine stuff.
2011-02-08T18:50:46  <McLeopold> http://asciipaint.com/
2011-02-08T18:51:03  <j3camero> lol well there you go
2011-02-08T18:51:17  <antimatroid> that's so cool
2011-02-08T18:51:20  <antimatroid> i drew boobies
2011-02-08T18:51:36  <antimatroid> yes i'm 2
2011-02-08T18:51:38  <antimatroid> 1*
2011-02-08T18:51:40  <antimatroid> 12**
2011-02-08T18:51:46  <j3camero> 120**?
2011-02-08T18:51:49  <j3camero> FTFY
2011-02-08T18:52:34  <antimatroid> i love how it "fills" with an animation
2011-02-08T18:52:38  <antimatroid> flood fill yay
2011-02-08T18:52:59  <antimatroid> i broke it
2011-02-08T18:53:29  <antimatroid> i was randomly filling a region with different characters and it ended up missing some
2011-02-08T18:53:36  <antimatroid> now it's jumbled inside the rectangle
2011-02-08T18:54:11  <janzert> McLeopold: so normal scoring is 1 point per food eaten with 1 food spawned per move and last player gets all remaining food in map + future spawns at end of game?
2011-02-08T18:54:21  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-08T18:54:25  <janzert> on first blush, seems like it could work
2011-02-08T18:54:30  <McLeopold> no incentive to make it last long
2011-02-08T18:54:34  <antimatroid> with my maps you really ought to spawn n food squares per turn
2011-02-08T18:54:50  <McLeopold> as long as the rate is known, we can give the bonus
2011-02-08T18:55:07  <janzert> yeah, as long as there is a fixed rate it will work
2011-02-08T18:55:43  <antimatroid> McLeopold: has your engine got fog of war?
2011-02-08T18:55:46  <McLeopold> we could have any type of rate, diminishing or increasing, and we could still calc the bonus
2011-02-08T18:55:49  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-08T18:56:01  <McLeopold> I can produce fogged maps.
2011-02-08T18:56:15  <McLeopold> I just putting it all together so I can get a sample movie going.
2011-02-08T18:56:24  <antimatroid> oh, do you want the visualiser to show squares that can't be seen by anyone as unseen?
2011-02-08T18:56:27  <antimatroid> that could be cool
2011-02-08T18:56:37  <McLeopold> yes, show all, or show perspective
2011-02-08T18:56:37  <janzert> and spawn points need to be random not predetermined
2011-02-08T18:56:47  <antimatroid> or just do that a darker "shade"
2011-02-08T18:56:51  <McLeopold> that might depend on the map
2011-02-08T18:56:59  * janzert has no idea how it is now
2011-02-08T18:57:10  <antimatroid> janzert: but with the option of using a seed so you can test your bot on maps
2011-02-08T18:57:11  <janzert> food spawn that is not player spawn
2011-02-08T18:57:22  <McLeopold> oh, yeah
2011-02-08T18:57:37  <janzert> antimatroid: yeah, that would be good too
2011-02-08T18:57:44  <McLeopold> we could just blast the whole map every 40 turns
2011-02-08T18:57:58  <McLeopold> ants would spawn like a wild fire
2011-02-08T18:57:59  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think it'd be easiest if you could just provide a bool parameter to the engine as to whether the seed should be set or not?
2011-02-08T18:58:23  <janzert> if you don't supply a seed, then just generate one :)
2011-02-08T18:58:26  <j3camero> What would happen if we spawned 1 food every time an ant dies? How about every time a food is eaten?
2011-02-08T18:58:40  <antimatroid> McLeopold: that's another issue, should food squares ever be within range of other ones? and do you get to spawn them like rapid fire in the one move? or over a few turns?
2011-02-08T18:58:48  <j3camero> These two schemes mean that the number of ants on the map stays more or less constant.
2011-02-08T18:58:56  <antimatroid> j3camero: i like that
2011-02-08T18:59:08  <janzert> j3camero: former gives constant population, latter constant food density
2011-02-08T18:59:09  <McLeopold> but, there goes my bonus idea
2011-02-08T18:59:29  <McLeopold> that would upset the scoring mechanism
2011-02-08T18:59:30  <j3camero> Well I'm just thinking what incentive it would produce to prolong the game.
2011-02-08T18:59:36  <janzert> yeah, and the McLeopold scoring system doesn't work anymore
2011-02-08T18:59:46  <antimatroid> yeah, go with a known rate
2011-02-08T19:00:04  <McLeopold> And I can't emphasize enough how *BAD* ranking bots by surviving turn is.
2011-02-08T19:00:23  <j3camero> Yeah that would produce camping.
2011-02-08T19:00:30  <janzert> no
2011-02-08T19:00:34  <McLeopold> j3camero: we don't want prolonged games...
2011-02-08T19:00:35  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what's the roadmap to a testing tcp server like?
2011-02-08T19:00:46  <antimatroid> it's hard to tell too much about the resolutions until then i think
2011-02-08T19:00:58  <McLeopold> step 1: finish engine, step 2: ?, step 3: TCP!
2011-02-08T19:01:23  <antimatroid> yeah, step 2? is that lots of work? or just a bit of changing?
2011-02-08T19:01:30  <McLeopold> work
2011-02-08T19:01:44  <janzert> any camping bot will be wiped out by an expanding bot, so camping only works if everyone camps
2011-02-08T19:01:56  <McLeopold> okay, got to ignore irc, must ...finish...engine...
2011-02-08T19:01:57  <antimatroid> i don't think camping would work well in any case
2011-02-08T19:02:01  <j3camero> Constant ants seems like it would encourage camping. Whenever you decide to fight you are giving away 1 ant in return for a 1/turf chance of getting a food back.
2011-02-08T19:02:20  <McLeopold> janzert: my concern isn't camping or not as a strategy, my concert is proper ranking of bots
2011-02-08T19:02:21  <janzert> yeah, I think constant ants is probably bad
2011-02-08T19:03:24  <McLeopold> j3camero: with ranged attacks, it might be more like 30/turf
2011-02-08T19:03:35  <janzert> I still think it would have some bad orderings but would work out fine overall
2011-02-08T19:04:06  <janzert> i.e. a bad ant may end up higher than it should occasionally but won't consistently
2011-02-08T19:04:10  <antimatroid> can we talk fight range actually?
2011-02-08T19:04:16  <antimatroid> as that changes up each rule as well
2011-02-08T19:04:32  <janzert> anyway like antimatroid said it will really need testing at this point to tell
2011-02-08T19:04:50  *** rebelxt1 <rebelxt1!~apinkin@24-155-144-5.static.grandenetworks.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-08T19:05:13  *** rebelxt <rebelxt!~apinkin@24-155-144-5.static.grandenetworks.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2011-02-08T19:05:48  <antimatroid> the biggest problem i see with allowing ants to land in the same square is complicating the visualiser
2011-02-08T19:06:11  <antimatroid> and i think the smaller region makes it easier to block/defend with option 1?
2011-02-08T19:06:19  <McLeopold> if we do 1 food per spawn/death, then that would allow hoarding
2011-02-08T19:06:51  <McLeopold> it no longer becomes necessary to hold onto land
2011-02-08T19:07:01  <j3camero> Oh true.
2011-02-08T19:07:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think the other way is better anyway, if people camp, eventually they're all going to grow so large that they have to fight
2011-02-08T19:07:42  <j3camero> Camping is a bad idea if you can't figure out whether other people are fighting.
2011-02-08T19:08:11  <antimatroid> j3camero: exactly, it's tough to know if you should even take on a tough battle because of that
2011-02-08T19:08:12  <McLeopold> if all bots camp, then the game will go long
2011-02-08T19:08:30  <antimatroid> McLeopold: that will just be a max turn game, but i find it very unlikely
2011-02-08T19:08:31  <McLeopold> If only one bot attempts to seek and destroy, they will take out the campers
2011-02-08T19:08:58  <antimatroid> i don't think people will find it a very lucrative strategy to camp
2011-02-08T19:09:14  <McLeopold> there really isn't "camping" in the sense of FPS games, since you can easily find others
2011-02-08T19:09:19  <j3camero> Well and you can get away with demolishing one neighbor as long as you can feign continued strength to you other neighbors. There's an incentive to give it to your neighbor if you think you'll win.
2011-02-08T19:09:58  <McLeopold> even if you can push a battle line back, you still should get a few more ants in return over time
2011-02-08T19:10:19  <j3camero> What if score the games thus: when you kill a player's last ant, you get a point.
2011-02-08T19:10:40  <j3camero> Produces an incentive to play interesting games and take risks.
2011-02-08T19:10:40  <antimatroid> j3camero: it's not always clear who killed who i don't think
2011-02-08T19:10:47  <McLeopold> so, I'm still for constant food, or at least something not geared off of deaths/births
2011-02-08T19:11:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i think everyone here is in agreement on that
2011-02-08T19:11:22  <j3camero> Yeah I would say having a steady flow of new food being spawned is a good idea.
2011-02-08T19:11:29  <McLeopold> j3camero: that makes cherry picking lucrative, I don't like it
2011-02-08T19:12:15  <j3camero> Cherry picking would be pretty tough I think, since you can't see your neighbors' other battle fronts.
2011-02-08T19:12:50  <McLeopold> 2 stupid bots that kill each other off with the first ant?
2011-02-08T19:12:58  <McLeopold> good strategy?
2011-02-08T19:13:03  <j3camero> It encourages bots to sick on a neighbor that looks like he might be having trouble on another front, or may be generally weak. You'll get players that suddenly collapse, with their two neighbors sprinting inwards towards each other looking for the kill.
2011-02-08T19:13:45  <McLeopold> or, you do an expert job taking out an opponent, then he runs his last ant over to someone else
2011-02-08T19:14:05  <McLeopold> dying bots get to be king maker
2011-02-08T19:14:44  <McLeopold> 1 point per kill (roughly) with food bonus for last bot is still best
2011-02-08T19:15:03  <McLeopold> You still want to rush in and kill
2011-02-08T19:15:19  <McLeopold> because you get the land
2011-02-08T19:17:01  <McLeopold> basically, I don't think you can make a single few events in the game decide the winners.  The game should be a marathon and favor those that did well through the entire game.
2011-02-08T19:17:58  <j3camero> Yeah I still don't know what to do about that. I'm afraid that the food bonuses may be so huge that they'll screw up the rankings.
2011-02-08T19:18:04  <j3camero> But it's best I know so far.
2011-02-08T19:18:17  <McLeopold> rankings are only a rank, score doesn't matter, for trueskill
2011-02-08T19:18:32  <McLeopold> so, you get 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on
2011-02-08T19:18:44  <McLeopold> winning by 1 point is the same as winning by 1000
2011-02-08T19:18:49  <j3camero> What if we score up until the last turn when the winning bot had less than 50% of the ants on the map?
2011-02-08T19:18:51  <janzert> yeah, score from a game is just the ordering that is important
2011-02-08T19:19:05  <McLeopold> so, the food bonus is just to ensure the last bot standing should be in 1st
2011-02-08T19:19:18  <j3camero> I see.
2011-02-08T19:19:54  <j3camero> Scoring by rank seems a bit bad to me. Would that not encourage camping? I know that poker players play ridiculously tight when there are six players left and 5 prizes left.
2011-02-08T19:20:23  <j3camero> If a bot guesses that there are about 3 players left it might clam up and avoid conflict.
2011-02-08T19:20:31  <McLeopold> that's why I want I want performance, not how long you survive
2011-02-08T19:20:50  <McLeopold> the bot that avoids conflict does not score much
2011-02-08T19:21:44  <McLeopold> so, even if you make it to the last 2, if you didn't do anything, you won't be ranked 2nd
2011-02-08T19:23:02  <McLeopold> We could call the game when 1 bot owns 75% or more of the ants?
2011-02-08T19:23:43  <McLeopold> no, that would encourage non-conflict
2011-02-08T19:24:07  <McLeopold> although, the bot that stopped the game could still be last...
2011-02-08T19:27:13  <j3camero> How about this. As the game runs, in the background, assign a color to each square on the map. They start off blank. When an ant moves around, you "paint" all the squares within a radius of 5 their color. As the ants move around, you repaint the squares. What we're going for here is some way to guess roughly who "controls" a piece of territory. We stop scoring after the last turn when every bot controlled less than 50% of the territory.
2011-02-08T19:27:31  <j3camero> So there's no point prolonging the game to delay an inevitable win.
2011-02-08T19:29:06  <McLeopold> so, the first bot that claims 50% wins?
2011-02-08T19:29:11  <janzert> so you want to gain control of 51% of the map and then camp right?
2011-02-08T19:29:19  <j3camero> If a bot is cocky and want to pump up its score it could just chill on 45% of the turf, but that would be risky.
2011-02-08T19:29:55  <antimatroid> what about this: you get a point for every square you can access first?
2011-02-08T19:29:56  <McLeopold> so, the painting is only for stoping the game, not scoring?
2011-02-08T19:30:00  <j3camero> It's not first to 50% wins. It's stop scoring after a bot passes the 50% mark for the *last time*.
2011-02-08T19:30:22  <antimatroid> including your currently occupied squares (so a point for every live ant)
2011-02-08T19:30:57  <j3camero> You still want to win as fast and as strongly as possible, but there's no point delaying a certain win.
2011-02-08T19:31:14  <janzert> any variation seems pretty complicated to calculate
2011-02-08T19:31:15  <McLeopold> j3camero: that would encourage delaying the game if you came from behind
2011-02-08T19:31:29  <j3camero> The only perverse incentive left is to chill at 49% for as long as possible. But even that is risky.
2011-02-08T19:31:39  <Zannick> so hold 50% for a long time, then give up 50% to your opponent?
2011-02-08T19:31:44  <McLeopold> the food bonus will get rid of any incentive to delay
2011-02-08T19:32:10  <McLeopold> a lot less confusing for beginners to understand
2011-02-08T19:32:20  <janzert> actually we  really want not just no incentive to delay, but an incentive to end early
2011-02-08T19:32:27  <McLeopold> yes
2011-02-08T19:32:34  <j3camero> Oh yeah you could still game the system by chilling at 90% for a while then retreating and letting the opponent demolish you.
2011-02-08T19:33:16  <McLeopold> j3camero: remember, the score doesn't really matter except to rank bots
2011-02-08T19:33:22  <j3camero> True yes.
2011-02-08T19:33:36  <McLeopold> so, that wouldn't really be gaming anything, but the server resources
2011-02-08T19:33:42  <j3camero> Yeah the food bonus is fine.
2011-02-08T19:33:50  <McLeopold> consider it written
2011-02-08T19:33:53  <McLeopold> ...
2011-02-08T19:34:06  <antimatroid> what are you doing?
2011-02-08T19:34:07  <j3camero> Now the issue that is shaky to me is having these really sharp discontinuities in the payoff function.
2011-02-08T19:34:23  <McLeopold> ?
2011-02-08T19:34:31  <antimatroid> "consider it written"
2011-02-08T19:34:32  <antimatroid> which thing?
2011-02-08T19:34:37  <McLeopold> food bonus
2011-02-08T19:34:58  <j3camero> If you get the idea that there are only three bots left, you really just want to avoid conflict.
2011-02-08T19:35:17  <janzert> maybe the end food bonus should better than the 1 point for 1 food during the game? say 1.5x or something
2011-02-08T19:35:31  <McLeopold> Are you sure?  If you can wipe them out, you get the win.
2011-02-08T19:35:51  <antimatroid> j3camero: i think it'll be hard to work that out
2011-02-08T19:36:00  <McLeopold> plus, conflict gives you points
2011-02-08T19:36:23  <janzert> yeah, an outright win will give you more in ranking than a 3 way tie
2011-02-08T19:36:30  <McLeopold> if you are fighting 3 bots, and they are only fighting you, you should have about 3 times the score, which makes sense
2011-02-08T19:37:21  <antimatroid> we're hiding players scores yes?
2011-02-08T19:37:23  <McLeopold> the scoring system will ensure very few ties
2011-02-08T19:37:25  <janzert> McLeopold: only if you're eating 3 times the food though right?
2011-02-08T19:37:32  <antimatroid> otherwise you might work out who is dead
2011-02-08T19:37:34  <janzert> yeah
2011-02-08T19:37:39  <McLeopold> even if there are 3 bots left, they probably won't have the same score
2011-02-08T19:37:47  <janzert> that's true
2011-02-08T19:37:56  <antimatroid> but if a bots score isn't changing, it's most likely dead
2011-02-08T19:38:07  <McLeopold> janzert: yes, I'm assuming if you can hold off 3 bots, you have roughly the same amount of food as them combined
2011-02-08T19:38:11  <janzert> you'll want to expand your territory whenever you think you can
2011-02-08T19:38:20  <janzert> ahh, ok
2011-02-08T19:38:58  <janzert> antimatroid: I think giving the bots ongoing scores during a game is probably bad
2011-02-08T19:39:16  <janzert> at least I don't see any real benefit and possible problems
2011-02-08T19:39:18  <antimatroid> are we going to try and hide the number of starting players?
2011-02-08T19:39:22  <McLeopold> if we are hiding player numbers, we can't give scores
2011-02-08T19:39:34  <antimatroid> McLeopold: there are other issues with hiding player numbers
2011-02-08T19:39:37  <antimatroid> like time limits
2011-02-08T19:39:42  <antimatroid> if doing moves simultaneously
2011-02-08T19:39:49  <janzert> I think hiding player numbers would be nice
2011-02-08T19:39:51  <McLeopold> Players can try an guess at the total points given the map size and turn limit, so they can try for some type of goal.
2011-02-08T19:40:03  <j3camero> I came up with a solution to that. Have the same time limit regardless of #players.
2011-02-08T19:40:14  <antimatroid> j3camero: so like 5 seconds?
2011-02-08T19:40:23  <j3camero> Something like that yeah.
2011-02-08T19:40:27  <antimatroid> fyi, my bot will probably always use whatever you give it
2011-02-08T19:40:33  <janzert> j3camero: yes, that's what I was trying to say the other day :)
2011-02-08T19:40:39  <McLeopold> j3camero: can we have a time bank?  200 seconds for the game, use at your discretion?
2011-02-08T19:40:55  <j3camero> That would work better than you expect, especially if the majority of games have between 5 and 8 players or something.
2011-02-08T19:41:01  <antimatroid> McLeopold: hard to do when people aren't making their moves sequentially isn't it?
2011-02-08T19:41:14  <j3camero> McLeopold: I thought a time bank would be nice, but how do you enforce that?
2011-02-08T19:41:18  <antimatroid> j3camero: i was thinking 4-16?
2011-02-08T19:41:24  <janzert> a time bank really needs to still have a per turn time as well
2011-02-08T19:41:27  <McLeopold> That's your problem. :)
2011-02-08T19:41:58  <janzert> e.g. the time bank can be enough to average out to 4 seconds per turn and the per turn limit is set at 10 seconds
2011-02-08T19:41:59  <j3camero> You can stop a player's clock when they send back their move to the engine, but what's to stop them from pondering the next move after that?
2011-02-08T19:42:08  <antimatroid> bank = 200 seconds, can use up to x of it per turn
2011-02-08T19:42:08  <antimatroid> turn limit = normal + min(x, bank)
2011-02-08T19:42:21  <antimatroid> j3camero: you "pause" processes
2011-02-08T19:42:27  <janzert> j3camero: pondering is fine, they already committed to the current information they have
2011-02-08T19:42:38  <janzert> let 'em ponder
2011-02-08T19:42:43  <antimatroid> yeah, or that
2011-02-08T19:43:01  <McLeopold> or go into "suck up server resources to crash other bots" mode
2011-02-08T19:43:01  <antimatroid> with tron that would have been bad, but for this i don't think you could do that much
2011-02-08T19:43:08  <antimatroid> other than waste other peoples time
2011-02-08T19:43:14  <antimatroid> ^^ yeah that
2011-02-08T19:43:20  <janzert> even with tron pondering didn't do much
2011-02-08T19:43:34  <janzert> at least at 1 second per turn and the top bot's using pretty much all of it
2011-02-08T19:43:36  <j3camero> Haha you get more food if you think faster.
2011-02-08T19:43:45  <antimatroid> janzert: yes it did, we recycled our tree from the move they picked, we could have kept it growing
2011-02-08T19:43:56  <janzert> yep, I did that
2011-02-08T19:43:59  <antimatroid> you're growing stuff you don't want as well, but you'd also grow some of what you do want
2011-02-08T19:44:13  <antimatroid> you can prune the move you made at least, that's a large chunk
2011-02-08T19:44:16  <janzert> antimatroid: but there was very little pondering in practice
2011-02-08T19:44:22  <McLeopold> 1 random ant dies per second of time you think
2011-02-08T19:44:30  <McLeopold> no limits.
2011-02-08T19:44:35  <antimatroid> janzert: it gave you extra time to grow the tree, that was our strategy
2011-02-08T19:45:33  <janzert> because you thought for 0.95 seconds or whatever, even if the opponent thought for 0.99 seconds you only got about .05 seconds of pondering, about 1/3 of that was wasted
2011-02-08T19:46:49  <antimatroid> yes, but if players got to make their decisions sequentially and your opponent barely used their time, you basically got double the time yeah?
2011-02-08T19:47:33  <janzert> if it had been sequential it would have most likely have been useful yes
2011-02-08T19:48:11  <janzert> way better than pondering in chess even :)
2011-02-08T19:48:33  <antimatroid> yeah, extending the depths of the tree can be futile, but it's still better than not
2011-02-08T19:48:48  <antimatroid> tree's will be the rage for this with fighting
2011-02-08T19:50:15  <antimatroid> i just had an idea for a sample bot
2011-02-08T19:50:19  <antimatroid> scardybot
2011-02-08T19:50:23  <antimatroid> runs away from enemies
2011-02-08T19:50:53  <McLeopold> passive agressive bot, it takes you food
2011-02-08T19:51:02  <antimatroid> hehe
2011-02-08T19:51:17  <antimatroid> actually, scaredybot would be a terrible example for quick games
2011-02-08T19:51:36  <Zannick> it's too bad there's going to be fog of war
2011-02-08T19:51:48  <Zannick> otherwise i would write a copybot for the starter packages
2011-02-08T19:52:10  <janzert> it'd be a good test bot though, run away from any enemy else run toward any food else random move
2011-02-08T19:52:30  <antimatroid> Zannick: while that'd be nice, fog of war is too much better :P
2011-02-08T19:52:37  <Zannick> i agree
2011-02-08T19:52:48  <antimatroid> janzert: you can do better than move randomly
2011-02-08T19:53:05  <antimatroid> if you can't go towards a food square, move towards the closest unseen square or something
2011-02-08T19:53:18  <antimatroid> or check how recently something was seen etc.
2011-02-08T19:54:46  <janzert> it's suppose to be a simple test bot though :)
2011-02-08T19:55:17  <janzert> for inclusion in the start package I meant
2011-02-08T19:56:22  <antimatroid> "it'd be a good test bot though"
2011-02-08T19:56:30  <antimatroid> i thought you meant as an actual test bot
2011-02-08T19:56:34  <antimatroid> not a starter bot, :P
2011-02-08T19:57:38  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what battle resolution are you currently using for the engine?
2011-02-08T19:57:40  <janzert> hmm, to me starter bot means the bot for people to build off of in the starter package. The other bots in the starter package I think of as test bots for people to test against
2011-02-08T19:58:06  <antimatroid> janzert: i am in favour of having a few harder bots included there
2011-02-08T19:58:06  <Zannick> oh, yes.
2011-02-08T19:58:16  <antimatroid> so people imediately have a range of difficulties to test with locally
2011-02-08T19:58:26  <antimatroid> and just don't release the code for those bots
2011-02-08T19:58:27  <Zannick> antimatroid: the problem is someone needs to come up with those ;)
2011-02-08T19:58:35  <antimatroid> Zannick: I and I'm sure others will
2011-02-08T19:58:35  <janzert> yeah, I wouldn't mind that. I would even include the code
2011-02-08T19:58:46  <antimatroid> although.. I can't do that in c++ can i?
2011-02-08T19:58:52  <antimatroid> as in my binary file wont run on any computer?
2011-02-08T19:58:52  <j3camero> janzert: I am having a really stupid n00b problem. I just set up a new domain for someone but every time I visit their index.php with my browser, I download the .php file instead of displaying it. Do you know what is causing this? I remember having this problem at some point long ago but I forgot what the problem was.
2011-02-08T19:59:01  <janzert> I was disappointed how closed off people were from sharing ideas in planetwars, tron was much better in that respect
2011-02-08T19:59:03  <Zannick> binary files won't run on every computer
2011-02-08T19:59:17  <antimatroid> janzert: i pretty much shared every idea i had
2011-02-08T19:59:28  <Zannick> pw's test bots were in jars, but the source was given, too
2011-02-08T19:59:44  <sigh> janzert: I was explaining a lot of stuff in the channel
2011-02-08T19:59:52  <janzert> j3camero: sounds like apache isn't setup to server php correctly
2011-02-08T19:59:59  <antimatroid> there weren't any good tutorials like with tron
2011-02-08T20:00:05  <antimatroid> i had no idea where to start without those
2011-02-08T20:00:23  <antimatroid> i'll do a forum tutorial at some point for this one with pretty .gifs
2011-02-08T20:00:24  <sigh> some people made some good write ups in the forums
2011-02-08T20:00:27  <janzert> I'm mostly thinking of the guy that posted his bot source and got soundly beat up for it
2011-02-08T20:00:44  <antimatroid> i don't think it was beating him up, their points were very vali
2011-02-08T20:00:46  <j3camero> janzert: that's the weird thing. It's the same server as the contest. I have set up like a dozen domains on there and never seen this problem. It's just a dummy hello world php file.
2011-02-08T20:01:00  <antimatroid> it sort of invalidates the work of people below that level if anyone can then upload a bot of better quality
2011-02-08T20:01:15  <janzert> hmm, it's been a long time since I've setup a new domain myself :}
2011-02-08T20:01:27  <sigh> that's like saying that you shouldn't participate unless you expect to get #1
2011-02-08T20:01:39  <janzert> I still think it's a great way for the people below to learn
2011-02-08T20:01:44  <antimatroid> sigh: not really, but it gives you less of an idea about how you've gone relative to other people
2011-02-08T20:01:54  <janzert> sure some of them will just copy and submit but...
2011-02-08T20:01:56  <antimatroid> as there might be quite a few copies of a better bot
2011-02-08T20:02:13  <antimatroid> janzert: they can particupate themselves and learn from shared source at the end
2011-02-08T20:02:28  <antimatroid> like tackling any problem, i think it's best to do it yourself, then look at how others did it
2011-02-08T20:02:38  <j3camero> When people sign up, they should choose from one of three options (1) never publish my code (2) publish my code after a delay of n days (3) publish my code after the submission deadline.
2011-02-08T20:02:50  <antimatroid> j3camero: skip option 2
2011-02-08T20:03:08  <antimatroid> and i would make it after results are released, just in case
2011-02-08T20:03:12  <sigh> janzert: yeah but I remember having this conversation in the channel... in the end my opinion was that it would have a negative effect *because* people didn't like it
2011-02-08T20:03:23  <sigh> not for any logical reason :)
2011-02-08T20:03:29  <Zannick> (1) never (2) after deadline (3) after results
2011-02-08T20:03:37  <antimatroid> i think their reasons are fine, even though i don't think it would affect me
2011-02-08T20:03:48  <sigh> why distinguish 2 and 3?
2011-02-08T20:04:00  * Zannick shrug
2011-02-08T20:04:16  <janzert> yeah, I suppose. I just liked the much more open feel the tron contest community ended up with. not sure there is any way to encourage it and there is probably a limit in size for it to happen at all
2011-02-08T20:04:22  <antimatroid> although unlikely, should something bad happen during the running of the contest and code is shared, it's ruined
2011-02-08T20:04:30  <antimatroid> something bad as in a server loses all bot data
2011-02-08T20:04:41  <sigh> janzert, I was't in tron but I like a more open atmosphere as well
2011-02-08T20:04:53  <antimatroid> when there is months of work going into some bots, i think it's better to be safe than sorry
2011-02-08T20:05:25  <antimatroid> i like general sharing of strategy/algorithms rather than actual raw code
2011-02-08T20:05:30  <antimatroid> let them go and code it up themselves
2011-02-08T20:05:51  <sigh> yeah, there was a fair bit of that though
2011-02-08T20:06:05  <antimatroid> yeah, and i thought that was sufficient
2011-02-08T20:06:21  <antimatroid> in fact i'd rather converse with people about their strategy rather than trudge through people's source
2011-02-08T20:06:22  <sigh> but still could have been better :)
2011-02-08T20:07:36  <antimatroid> what's the deal with google having MOVE_H_ instead of MOVE_H for #ifdef's etc.?
2011-02-08T20:07:44  <antimatroid> it's a redundant character as far as i'm concerned
2011-02-08T20:08:16  <sigh> makes it clear that it is a special variable *shrug*
2011-02-08T20:08:51  <sigh> trailing/leading underscores are pretty standard for marking variables/whatever like that
2011-02-08T20:09:18  <antimatroid> bleh, i can't think of a single situation where it'd be unclear
2011-02-08T20:09:21  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@67.139.105.186> has left #aichallenge
2011-02-08T20:09:27  <antimatroid> i'm a minimalist
2011-02-08T20:09:50  <antimatroid> provided it's clear
2011-02-08T20:10:00  <antimatroid> i don't use 1 name variables for everything, that would be painful
2011-02-08T20:10:02  <sigh> but you were against "ur" :P
2011-02-08T20:10:09  <antimatroid> and not ugly
2011-02-08T20:10:30  <sigh> bah, mathematicians love one letter variables
2011-02-08T20:11:19  <jmcarthur> "Ur" is the name of a programming language i've been looking into today
2011-02-08T20:12:10  <jmcarthur> i also think that it's better to share strategies and high level algorithms than to share straight up source code
2011-02-08T20:12:10  <sigh> 'The signature of the standard library is such that well-typed Ur/Web programs "don't go wrong" '
2011-02-08T20:12:11  <sigh> haha
2011-02-08T20:12:33  <jmcarthur> sigh: that's actually a common thing to say about most statically typed, pure languages
2011-02-08T20:12:54  <sigh> :P
2011-02-08T20:12:54  <jmcarthur> but yeah, that's the gist
2011-02-08T20:13:20  <jmcarthur> you can screw up, but it is guaranteed not to crash, error out, or become a security problem
2011-02-08T20:13:32  <jmcarthur> and the compiler will catch most screwups anyway
2011-02-08T20:14:05  <sigh> fair enough
2011-02-08T20:14:35  <antimatroid> sigh: i use a lot of 1 letter variables, but not everything
2011-02-08T20:14:55  <jmcarthur> the thing about 1-letter variables is that sometimes there's really just not anything better to use
2011-02-08T20:15:06  <sigh> probably because you are forced to, I remember you complaining about being restricted to ascii
2011-02-08T20:15:07  <jmcarthur> especially if you are writing very polymorphic code (no idea what the actual type is)
2011-02-08T20:15:17  <antimatroid> usually just for iterators in for loops etc. a = ant, d = direction, r,c = row,col etc.
2011-02-08T20:15:30  <jmcarthur> well, for example, generic list operations
2011-02-08T20:15:37  <jmcarthur> no idea what to name the elements. x is fine
2011-02-08T20:15:42  <sigh> yeah I know, usally in maths everything is very genral

2011-02-08T20:16:34  <antimatroid> i think everyone should mack row col and x y equivalent

2011-02-08T20:17:25  <jmcarthur> e.g. one of the operands in matrix multiplication
2011-02-08T20:17:50  <antimatroid> what for traversing the right multipliees columns?
2011-02-08T20:17:55  <jmcarthur> when you know that multiplication is coming up, might as well orient it ideally in the first place

2011-02-08T20:19:05  <jmcarthur> or at least make it very easy
2011-02-08T20:19:52  <jmcarthur> well it's easier to write the actual multiplication that way too
2011-02-08T20:20:05  <jmcarthur> you can make it a pretty simple parallel loop
2011-02-08T20:20:17  <jmcarthur> it's just a matter of how hard/easy it is to arrange for that simplicity in the first place

2011-02-08T20:22:16  <jmcarthur> if dot product is defined it's like 1 line
2011-02-08T20:22:25  <jmcarthur> and dot product is like one line, too

2011-02-08T21:17:33  <j3camero> Just wondering if it's a dude I knew in high school.
2011-02-08T21:17:42  <antimatroid> i think he's older than you

2011-02-08T21:17:50  <antimatroid> us somewhere
2011-02-08T21:17:58  <j3camero> Hmm probably just a coincidence.
2011-02-08T21:18:03  <antimatroid> he has a kid
2011-02-08T21:18:09  <antimatroid> i imagine mcleopold in his thirties
2011-02-08T21:18:18  <jbroman> whois says Olympia, WA
2011-02-08T21:18:58  <jbroman> So probably a different Scott Hamilton.

2011-02-08T22:14:10  <j3camero> If somebody else wants to yank that task from me go right ahead. I recommend using the sadbox python module from the planet_wars/backend directory. You use it to launch a bot and then you send and receive strings to/from it.

2011-02-08T22:53:32  <Prillicy> you all are quite talkative
2011-02-08T22:53:42  <jbroman> Prillicy: That only means that we talk a lot.
2011-02-08T22:54:01  <Prillicy> ?
2011-02-08T22:54:24  <jbroman> That we're talkative doesn't mean we're nearly ready to go. Progress has been made, but there is still much progress yet to be made.
2011-02-08T22:54:36  <Prillicy> you misunderstand
2011-02-08T22:54:47  <Prillicy> those were two entirely different statements
2011-02-08T22:55:00  <Prillicy> the first is based on my reading on the forums
2011-02-08T22:55:10  <Prillicy> the second was a sarcastic observation
2011-02-08T22:55:37  <jmcarthur> it's mostly a bunch of bikeshedding
2011-02-08T22:55:42  <Prillicy> but I was more hoping it was close to being done more than anything
2011-02-08T22:57:05  <jbroman> Prillicy: It's still probably a few weeks out, but this is unpredictable.
2011-02-08T22:57:28  <jmcarthur> well, simplistic twitter clone in about 30 lines including html isn't too bad i guess
2011-02-08T22:58:14  <jmcarthur> no ajax though

2011-02-08T23:02:50  <jmcarthur> i had pizza tonight
2011-02-08T23:03:41  <antimatroid> atm i think it's the case that any food square within range of more than 2 ants dies after killing ants? how about this idea:
2011-02-08T23:03:42  <antimatroid> move ants, resolve spawning of new ants/killing food, kill ants/battle
2011-02-08T23:03:42  <antimatroid> option 1: if you have more ants closer to it than anyone else, you get the square, otherwise it dies
2011-02-08T23:03:42  <antimatroid> option 2: if you have the closest ant to the square, you get it, otherwise it dies
2011-02-08T23:03:52  <antimatroid> if you do that after battle resolution, you have to resolve them yet again
2011-02-08T23:04:44  <antimatroid> anyone else please comment :P
2011-02-08T23:06:30  <Prillicy> i had pizza too

2011-02-08T23:06:41  <antimatroid> i shall ride to subway soonish
2011-02-08T23:06:41  <Prillicy> I don't like the 1 ant kills many
2011-02-08T23:06:51  <antimatroid> Prillicy: what do you mean?
2011-02-08T23:06:51  <Prillicy> but that's not food oriented
2011-02-08T23:07:05  <antimatroid> it adds complexity to the game in a good way
2011-02-08T23:07:11  <Prillicy> from the post
2011-02-08T23:07:18  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: by option 1 do you mean if you have more ants *in range* of it than anyone else?
2011-02-08T23:08:19  <Prillicy> one ant couldn't kill many
2011-02-08T23:08:19  <Prillicy> besides, it takes away the benefit of keeping your ants grouped together
2011-02-08T23:08:19  <Prillicy> in doing so, it encourages intentional separation and scavenging, removing strategy
2011-02-08T23:08:42  <jmcarthur> Prillicy: you are talking about option 2 in the forum post?
2011-02-08T23:08:43  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: yeah
2011-02-08T23:09:07  <antimatroid> Prillicy: jmcarthur and i are very much in favour of option 1 over 2
2011-02-08T23:09:07  <Prillicy> I am not sure where it was in the post
2011-02-08T23:09:21  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i'm not sure which i like better. the first one mimicks my favorite combat rule, but maybe food shouldn't be the same
2011-02-08T23:09:22  <antimatroid> which encourages you to move around in packs to attack/defend better
2011-02-08T23:09:31  <antimatroid> but you also need to separate out if you want any chance of winning
2011-02-08T23:09:36  <jmcarthur> not only in packs, but in *formations* ^^ :)
2011-02-08T23:09:52  <Prillicy> precisely, creating strategy
2011-02-08T23:10:01  <jmcarthur> seems that we all agree then
2011-02-08T23:10:04  <antimatroid> yes, that's what we want, but jeff thinks that will discourage beginners
2011-02-08T23:10:30  <jmcarthur> and unfortunately jeff is the only one whose opinion matters because he is the benevolent dictator
2011-02-08T23:10:44  <Prillicy> checking what option 1 was
2011-02-08T23:10:57  <antimatroid> you need to have someone make the final choices, i'd pick jeff over a lot of other people
2011-02-08T23:12:23  <antimatroid> can anyone work out what the hell dimkadimons last example is doing?

2011-02-08T23:14:20  <Prillicy> just remind jeff that the option he creates removes all semblance of strategy and replaces it with, simply, if your bot unctions at all, you're equal
2011-02-08T23:14:26  <jmcarthur> i think the capitals are one team and the lowercase is another, but what he says along with it is simply wrong, if he's talking about option 1

2011-02-08T23:20:37  <Prillicy> I wouldn't even suspect option 2 to be a possibility, it was odd to me when I saw it.  If I had coded something like that, I'd call it a bug

2011-02-08T23:23:21  <antimatroid> ad requires full map information to ensure you get it right
2011-02-08T23:24:15  <antimatroid> we haven't even really analysed situations where lots of players ants are in a region
2011-02-08T23:24:30  <antimatroid> i think that would be awesome with option 1
2011-02-08T23:24:43  <antimatroid> not fight region, a larger region working out where best to move
2011-02-08T23:24:49  <Prillicy> it also sounds like it would greatly favor whoever goes first

2011-02-08T23:43:25  <antimatroid> with option 2, you also want to end up attacking people from as far as possible don't you? least some idiot decided to attack from closer
2011-02-08T23:43:45  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-08T23:43:51  <jmcarthur> i've described it as a game of chicken
2011-02-08T23:44:02  <jmcarthur> you keep everybody spread out and attack with one ant at a time
2011-02-08T23:44:41  <jmcarthur> there could be some micro in the sense that you can use "fear" to kind of herd an opponent's army around
2011-02-08T23:44:48  <jmcarthur> but that's... kind of a macro thing
2011-02-08T23:46:16  <antimatroid> damnit, we must have option 1
2011-02-08T23:59:38  <nullkuhl> hello, is there anything confirmed yet regarding the start date of the next contest ? or even an estimate ?
