2011-02-20T00:00:53  <antimatroid> i'm trying to work out the rule of what battle/spawn radiuses must be relative to each other
2011-02-20T00:02:16  <antimatroid> i think it's just when spawnradius is 1 that an issue arises
2011-02-20T00:02:26  <antimatroid> like hebbie said :P
2011-02-20T00:02:38  <flag> Is the spawnradius currently 1?
2011-02-20T00:03:19  <flag> Doesn't look like it
2011-02-20T00:03:42  <antimatroid> no, but my ideal parameters were spawnr = 1, attackr = rt(5)
2011-02-20T00:04:16  <flag> Ah
2011-02-20T00:04:26  <flag> Is the output row, col or col, row?
2011-02-20T00:04:42  <antimatroid> row col
2011-02-20T00:04:50  <flag> It was col, row before wasn't it?
2011-02-20T00:04:50  <antimatroid> everything has gone to row col finally thankgod
2011-02-20T00:04:54  <antimatroid> yes
2011-02-20T00:04:54  <flag> Okay
2011-02-20T00:05:06  <antimatroid> everything is consistent and never needs transposing if one uses row col
2011-02-20T00:05:15  <antimatroid> it amazes me for that reason alone that anyone would ever use x y
2011-02-20T00:08:25  <flag> Yay, crappy C bot has successfully been ported to volatile spec

2011-02-20T11:37:37  <McLeopold> I could put a list of owners at the end of the line?
2011-02-20T11:38:28  <antimatroid1> just print a line with the player after the row
2011-02-20T11:38:41  <antimatroid1> if enemy ants collide, print more than one line
2011-02-20T11:39:20  <McLeopold> ok
2011-02-20T11:39:33  <antimatroid1> i think you should scrap the whole land square information stuff, then just send info for all currently visible ants (alive or just dead) and food squares, then any wall squares the first time you see them. I think the input might actually be less then anyway, be easier for the engine to actually deal with, easier to explain to people and easier to deal with
2011-02-20T11:39:59  <McLeopold> a lot less, but then bots need to calc vision themselves
2011-02-20T11:40:07  <antimatroid1> they already have to
2011-02-20T11:40:21  <McLeopold> no they don't
2011-02-20T11:40:26  <McLeopold> my sample bots don't
2011-02-20T11:40:31  <antimatroid1> you only get land the first time you see it
2011-02-20T11:41:12  <antimatroid1> how do you know for example how much you can see on a turn afer that?
2011-02-20T11:42:37  <McLeopold> you get more land lines?
2011-02-20T11:42:40  <antimatroid1> it's also fairly easy then to write a function to create the char map we previously sent, which then gives you the vision amount
2011-02-20T11:43:02  <antimatroid1> are you talking about total number of squares seen in the game? or squares you can currently see this turn?
2011-02-20T11:43:10  <antimatroid1> i'm referring to the later

2011-02-20T11:44:30  <McLeopold> I'm talking total squares
2011-02-20T11:45:24  <antimatroid1> total squares is easy to do with anything, just keep an extra variable with each square whether the square has been seen at all yet
2011-02-20T11:45:34  <antimatroid1> and a counter of how many you've seen
2011-02-20T11:46:30  <antimatroid1> anyway, i can live with it as is now, but i think it'd make things easier to just send currently visible ants/food and first time seen water squares
2011-02-20T11:47:00  <antimatroid1> the explanation of that is a lot easier than wording out when you will see a land square again
2011-02-20T11:50:16  *** kaemo <kaemo!~mad5ci@d61-117.icpnet.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-02-20T11:56:51  <McLeopold> In the interest of keeping the bots simple, I think I'll stick with giving out the land you can see for the first time.
2011-02-20T11:57:42  <antimatroid1> the bots would still be very simple
2011-02-20T11:57:55  <antimatroid1> at the start of each turn, set everything that isn't a wall to land
2011-02-20T11:58:03  <antimatroid1> then read the state info in, then make moves
2011-02-20T11:58:23  <antimatroid1> i think it makes everything easier :P
2011-02-20T11:58:30  <McLeopold> That would work.  But then they are assuming they can walk everywhere at first
2011-02-20T11:58:40  <McLeopold> Actually, I kinda like it
2011-02-20T11:58:50  <McLeopold> So, no land ever gets sent
2011-02-20T11:58:56  <antimatroid1> i was always going to assume I can walk anywhere until known otherwise :P
2011-02-20T11:59:23  <antimatroid1> i will also be marking squares by "last seen" with 0 being not seen yet
2011-02-20T11:59:30  <antimatroid1> but that's for people to do themselves
2011-02-20T11:59:46  <McLeopold> so, you still want a land line to mark disappearing things?
2011-02-20T11:59:51  <antimatroid1> no
2011-02-20T12:00:24  <antimatroid1> basic rule would be: you get sent info for a water square the first time you see it, then you also get info for any ants (live or just dead) and food you can see, that's it
2011-02-20T12:00:48  <McLeopold> Yeah, that would be a lot less info, and still simple for the sample bots.
2011-02-20T12:01:08  <antimatroid1> yep, and easier to explain and for you :)
2011-02-20T12:02:19  <antimatroid1> then if people really want, they can read that info into a char map of ?'s and paint out the '.' squares from 'a' to get the char map, which is what I plan to do
2011-02-20T12:05:06  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: did you remove the "end" line from bots input?
2011-02-20T12:05:17  <antimatroid1> i don't really care for it, just checking for taking it out of the spec
2011-02-20T12:17:26  <McLeopold> no
2011-02-20T12:17:31  <McLeopold> I didn't mean to
2011-02-20T12:18:13  <McLeopold> Oh, the sample bot input was a bot that was eliminated
2011-02-20T12:18:50  <McLeopold> So, I either need to send the end line to them and the middle game scores, or keep it running and send them the info at the end.
2011-02-20T12:19:11  <McLeopold> Either way, this info is for tcp and local debugging/learning only.  It wouldn't matter for the official server.
2011-02-20T12:19:35  <McLeopold> So really, whatever people using tcp find the most useful
2011-02-20T12:21:54  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I just updated the specs page for bot and visualiser input

2011-02-20T12:22:50  <antimatroid1> or loadtime/turntime etc. but it does need the number of players and the version

2011-02-20T12:26:35  <McLeopold> nice

2011-02-20T15:27:33  <jmcarthur> the visualizer keeps dead ants around now? is that intentional?
2011-02-20T15:27:41  <McLeopold> yeah, it was a hack
2011-02-20T15:27:54  <McLeopold> but I'd like it to show area's of high conflict
2011-02-20T15:28:17  <jmcarthur> cool
2011-02-20T15:28:46  <jmcarthur> sucks that they disappear when ants run over them, but no biggie i guess
2011-02-20T15:28:58  <jmcarthur> ah and they don't reset when the game starts over
2011-02-20T15:29:11  <jmcarthur> or reappear when you go wrap backward to the last turn
2011-02-20T15:30:15  <McLeopold> yeah, hack job
2011-02-20T15:30:50  <jmcarthur> might also be cool to make a square get gradually darker if more than one ant dies on it over time
2011-02-20T15:31:05  <jmcarthur> like a heat map, i guess
2011-02-20T15:32:37  <McLeopold> yes, I thought of that!  it would be cool
