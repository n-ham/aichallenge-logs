2011-04-20T00:36:44  <jaycobcoleman> just curious
2011-04-20T00:40:26  <bhasker> was just wondering how battle resolution is happening
2011-04-20T00:40:39  <bhasker> especially when multiple ants are around,
2011-04-20T00:41:02  <bhasker> do i just go ant by ant and hit them with 1/n ants in surrounding attack radius
2011-04-20T00:41:08  <bhasker> and then eliminate the ones that take more than 1
2011-04-20T00:41:24  <jaycobcoleman> to my understanding yes
2011-04-20T00:41:28  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-04-20T00:42:14  <jaycobcoleman> are you doing engine work?
2011-04-20T00:42:59  <bhasker> nope
2011-04-20T00:43:08  <bhasker> just playing around with a bot that i was writing
2011-04-20T00:45:02  <jaycobcoleman> ah I see. What language?
2011-04-20T00:46:22  <bhasker> c++
2011-04-20T00:47:13  <bhasker> have a basic bot working trying to add a few features
2011-04-20T00:47:23  <bhasker> this time trying to be a bit more methodical about my bot
2011-04-20T00:47:56  <jaycobcoleman> what did your last one do? I saw it but I can't quite remember
2011-04-20T00:48:31  <bhasker> that was a simpe one it just hunts for food and if no food around goes after enemy bots
2011-04-20T00:48:38  <bhasker> with some BFS search to find shortest paths
2011-04-20T00:49:02  <bhasker> and some calculations to ensure closest ants go after food
2011-04-20T00:49:07  <bhasker> and not all of them
2011-04-20T00:49:21  <bhasker> but when i meant this time around, i meant this contest:) last contest my bot was a pile of heuristic rules
2011-04-20T00:50:39  <jaycobcoleman> oh haha. I have no experience with ai prior to now, but I'd ceratinly like to be around when the next game gets going to help make starters and such

2011-04-20T00:54:01  <jaycobcoleman> Oh god. I just discovered a pretty serious flaw in gedit.
2011-04-20T00:54:58  <jaycobcoleman> I had it set to insert tabs as spaces, but I got tired of deleting tons of spaces so I changed it back to tabs and now I
2011-04-20T00:55:14  <jaycobcoleman> *I'm getting tons of indent errors
2011-04-20T00:55:49  <bhasker> just get it to an autoindent
2011-04-20T00:57:26  <jaycobcoleman> I do have it set to autoindent. But it evidently doesn't recognize a tab with a space length set to four as equivalent to four spaces
2011-04-20T00:58:19  <jaycobcoleman> I think it only considers a tab of any size as one space, which fine as long as you consistently use only spaces or only tabs, but disasterous if you switch at some point in-between

2011-04-20T04:52:00  <jaycobcoleman> What happens in the case that 2 ants from one bot and one from another are all within spawn radius of a food square?
2011-04-20T04:53:56  <woudshoo> according to the rules, the food dissappears without spawning an ant
2011-04-20T04:54:34  <jaycobcoleman> hmm, that's what I thought.
2011-04-20T04:55:21  <woudshoo> I haven't really looked but doesn't it work that way?
2011-04-20T04:56:07  <jaycobcoleman> seems to. But I think I would prefer making the situation impossible
2011-04-20T04:57:42  <jaycobcoleman> I think the battle radius should always be more than twice the size of the spawn radius.
2011-04-20T04:59:49  <jaycobcoleman> It seems unfair that in a situation where one bot would definitely come out as the winner and then be able to claim its food square it can instead by destroyed by a single ant

2011-04-20T05:05:21  <jaycobcoleman> In theory a bot that came out poorly in battles could camp right outside the spawn radius of food squares and then move in as soon as an enemy ant was about to claim it, both keeping the bot from getting a new ant and preventing its scoring by killing the other ant. I feel like this must already be at the very least an unspoken rule. Unless my logic is flawed somewhere.

2011-04-20T05:29:30  <antimatroid> guys, battles happen before spawning
2011-04-20T05:30:17  <antimatroid> if they are within fight range, one player may get to spawn there, but if they aren't in fight range and that happens then the food disappears

2011-04-20T05:54:28  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: My argument is that there shouldn't be cases in which 2 enemies can both be in the spawn range of food, yet not in each others' battle radii
2011-04-20T06:25:08  <woudshoo> jaycobcoleman:  But increasing the battle radius does not solve that.  It is still possible to end with live ants of 2 parties inside each other battle radius.
2011-04-20T06:29:58  <jaycobcoleman> Well of course, that's what a battle is. I'm talking about the food's spawn radius. If it's less than half the size of the battle radius then there's no way that two ants can be in the spawn radius of the same food square, therefore we no longer have to deal with the wierd situation of food occasionally disappearing
2011-04-20T06:30:56  <jaycobcoleman> plus I think the gameplay would be more eventful
2011-04-20T06:31:32  <jaycobcoleman> from what I've seen people are tending to focus almost completely on food collection as opposed to fighting and it leads to a fairly uneventful game
2011-04-20T06:32:43  <jaycobcoleman> decreasing spawn radius and increasing battle radius would both get rid of the strange food despawning situation and increase each bot's need to be able to handle itself in a battle
2011-04-20T06:34:05  <jaycobcoleman> plus larger battle radius means more complex battle dynamics and more strategy involved in keeping your ants alive, potentially even when you're going up against an enemy with considerably more ants than yourself

2011-04-20T07:29:46  <woudshoo> Ah, it is a bit hard to explain in text.  But the basic setup is that two players, A and B are approaching the food with 2 ants each and player C provides each turn a sacrifice.
2011-04-20T07:30:37  <woudshoo> Player A and B's ant see 3 enemy ants each and player C sees 4 enemy ants.
2011-04-20T07:31:15  <woudshoo> Player A and B's ant receive eache 2 * 1/3 + 1/4 < 1 damage and C 's ant receives 2 * 2/3 > 1 damage
2011-04-20T07:31:47  <woudshoo> So ant C dissappears and A's and B's move closer to the food.
2011-04-20T07:31:50  <woudshoo> Repeat
2011-04-20T07:32:12  <woudshoo> If these exact logistics do not work, you need some more supporting ants, but basically this is the idea.
2011-04-20T07:35:53  <jaycobcoleman> I was under the impression they didn't move until the battle was completely resolved. If this is the case instead then I most certainly agree

2011-04-20T08:06:44  <jaycobcoleman> it just doesn't help anyone and it detracts from the value of superior strategy
2011-04-20T08:06:56  <sigh> antimatroid: meh, just download all the logs to local disk
2011-04-20T08:07:58  <antimatroid> the alternative is to not "kill" food, but then sections of the map might turn into deadlocks
2011-04-20T08:08:01  <antimatroid> which we don't want
2011-04-20T08:08:24  <antimatroid> sigh: my point is that sucks :P
2011-04-20T08:10:08  <sigh> I have all the logs locally anyway, so I can grep them

2011-04-20T08:46:01  <antimatroid> i forget how sigh referred to my sleeping routine recently
2011-04-20T08:46:06  <antimatroid> but it made me chuckle
2011-04-20T08:47:19  <smiley1983> I like programming after I've been awake for a while. When there's something interesting to do, this encourages late nights to become later.
2011-04-20T08:48:02  <antimatroid> yeah, i am often most productive in the middle of the night
2011-04-20T08:48:32  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: Do you want to disable fighting across water?
2011-04-20T08:48:33  <woudshoo> jaycobcoleman:  You mention that you feel it is too much about food gathering.  My experiments do not bear that out.
2011-04-20T08:49:03  <antimatroid> a lot of the same food gathering methods will show up
2011-04-20T08:49:10  <antimatroid> the real battle arena is going to be battles
2011-04-20T08:49:25  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: i do, but i don't get to make the decisions
2011-04-20T08:49:28  <jaycobcoleman> The matches I've seen involving more complex bots have spendt most of their time collectin food. I don't think it should be about that at all
2011-04-20T08:49:35  <woudshoo> I think it will boil down to:  1- all bots will have very good food gathering.  To do it optimally is hard, but I think that is not needed.  The battles is where the good bots distinguish themselves
2011-04-20T08:49:45  <antimatroid> nobody has done enough to do game trees for battles yet
2011-04-20T08:49:53  <antimatroid> it requires more effort, it's easy to play around with food gathering
2011-04-20T08:50:07  <jaycobcoleman> what does making game trees entail?
2011-04-20T08:50:11  <woudshoo> But I think you see it is all about food because that is where you start implementing a bot.  After that is done, battle is next.
2011-04-20T08:50:39  <antimatroid> setting up nodes, creating the tree, iterating states, evaluating states, doing backward induction, extracting moves and making them etc.
2011-04-20T08:50:51  <antimatroid> deleting all your memory if you're using c++ etc.
2011-04-20T08:51:09  <woudshoo> I am playing around with a bot and am just starting to look at battles.  This is the hard and really important bit.
2011-04-20T08:52:03  <woudshoo> My bot loses quite a bit to Stocha's bot.  But that is because Stocha's bot somehow places its ants much better, so my ants die when it encounters it.
2011-04-20T08:52:17  <antimatroid> i plan to partition "battle ants" into sets of who can affect each other, then iteratively use a game tree to pick moves for x amount of time
2011-04-20T08:52:19  <woudshoo> W.r.t food gathering, both bots are similar.
2011-04-20T08:52:23  <antimatroid> then just move the rest towards their closest friend
2011-04-20T08:52:33  <jaycobcoleman> woudshoo: I could be wrong, and it's probably my fault, but I feel like you may be misinterpretting me. I think it should be a lot about battles
2011-04-20T08:53:08  <woudshoo> jaycobcoleman:  I am trying to say, don't worry, it will be about battles, we are just in the phase that everybody is concentrating on food.
2011-04-20T08:53:35  <jaycobcoleman> alright, good
2011-04-20T08:53:44  <smiley1983> How will you select moves for consideration in the game tree?
2011-04-20T08:54:53  *** Ice_Harley <Ice_Harley!4d7921fb@gateway/web/freenode/ip.77.121.33.251> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-20T08:55:23  <smiley1983> That is - do you plan to consider one ant's move to be one node in the tree, or will a node represent a "strategy"?
2011-04-20T08:55:58  <jaycobcoleman> I just created a function that for any given point will create a map based on the water information I have that shows the minimum number of moves it will take to get to that point from every other point on the map
2011-04-20T08:56:39  <smiley1983> How long does it take to execute on a large map?
2011-04-20T08:57:50  <jaycobcoleman> I haven't noticed any significant delay. I don't have my bot running with it yet though, so I've just been testing the function itself. I also haven't tested it with very large maps yet. I'll do so shortly
2011-04-20T08:58:16  <smiley1983> I've been considering a similar thing, but haven't gotten that far yet, and I was concerned about how much time it might take.
2011-04-20T08:59:20  <jaycobcoleman> I have several similar ideas that haven't quite played out yet, but they seem to go pretty quickly and i can see them as being phenominally useful
2011-04-20T09:00:09  <smiley1983> Yes, building a map of pathfinding data early in the game could be exceptionally useful in the late game. :)
2011-04-20T09:00:09  <antimatroid> smiley1983: unsure yet, i'm tempted to take the set of non-water moves for each ant then find the set of strategies that don't result in cycles to pick out strategies for each player
2011-04-20T09:00:28  <antimatroid> otherwise i usually just move each of my ants over x layers, then move onto the other player
2011-04-20T09:00:47  <antimatroid> pathfinding map is easy
2011-04-20T09:01:07  <antimatroid> actually, no it's not,
2011-04-20T09:01:26  <smiley1983> do you feel like telling your thoughts on that? :)
2011-04-20T09:01:40  <antimatroid> on what?
2011-04-20T09:01:44  <smiley1983> pathfindig
2011-04-20T09:01:49  <smiley1983> *pathfinding
2011-04-20T09:01:55  <antimatroid> breadth first search with a queue
2011-04-20T09:02:19  <antimatroid> a* would be nice, but i don't see it working well when you don't have a specific target
2011-04-20T09:02:24  <antimatroid> but bhasker thinks otherwise
2011-04-20T09:02:30  <smiley1983> Is that executed per ant, per turn, or is the data built up over successive turns?
2011-04-20T09:02:53  <antimatroid> you can do it from all ants simultaneously if you just want shortest paths to squares from any ant
2011-04-20T09:03:06  <antimatroid> or you can search from an ant with a queue until you find something useful etc.
2011-04-20T09:03:59  <jaycobcoleman> I've actually experimented with all of these and can't figure out which ones I think will be most useful
2011-04-20T09:04:28  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: again, I know you aren't in charge of the code, but if I make some ants.py additions to add the capability to disable battles over water do you think I could get them pushed?
2011-04-20T09:05:20  <antimatroid> atm i plan to do something like the following:
2011-04-20T09:05:20  <antimatroid> for up to 50% of the time - move battle ants with game trees
2011-04-20T09:05:20  <antimatroid> move the rest of battle ants to their closest friends
2011-04-20T09:05:20  <antimatroid> collect food
2011-04-20T09:05:20  <antimatroid> pair enemy ants off with friend ants and move ants appropriately
2011-04-20T09:05:20  <antimatroid> move ants towards not recently seen squares and other heuristics
2011-04-20T09:05:40  <antimatroid> battles are happening over water
2011-04-20T09:06:39  <woudshoo> antimatroid:  Were you worrying about crossing paths when finding food?
2011-04-20T09:06:48  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-20T09:06:52  <antimatroid> and in other situations
2011-04-20T09:07:54  <woudshoo> Maybe it isn't really an issue, if a ---> p and b --> q and their paths intersect at x.  The triangle inequality tells you that the paths a ---> q and b ---> p won't be longer (in total)  of course they might still intersect at x.
2011-04-20T09:07:58  <antimatroid> my best idea for that so far is a set<pair<int, Location> > to indicate when a square will be taken
2011-04-20T09:08:16  <antimatroid> and use that information while path finding
2011-04-20T09:09:19  *** ginDeVine <ginDeVine!~ginDeVine@cm-84.215.113.118.getinternet.no> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-20T09:09:26  <woudshoo> What I am struggling a bit is moving ants simultanuously.  that is, move a pack of ants such that I do not create holes in the pack.
2011-04-20T09:09:59  <antimatroid> that's tricky
2011-04-20T09:10:26  <antimatroid> if you're happy to deal with the occasional "collision", you can move ants onto a square already containing an ant that hasn't moved yet
2011-04-20T09:10:37  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid, your ideas are just as crazy and elaborate as my own. The key difference is that you probably know how to implement them to some degree :P
2011-04-20T09:10:56  <antimatroid> i had no idea at the start of tron, experience helps :P
2011-04-20T09:12:04  <woudshoo> antimatroid: Hm, that sounds bad, suppose you move a pack and you encounter a corridor, suddenly all ants squeeze in the corridor and if you ignore that you could lose half your ants.
2011-04-20T09:12:20  <antimatroid> i don't think you would lose half of them
2011-04-20T09:12:27  <antimatroid> but you may lose one or two
2011-04-20T09:12:45  <woudshoo> Maybe I should first ignore my own ants, prepare the moves and before issuing the orders check for conflicts
2011-04-20T09:12:45  <antimatroid> on my squares i have int ant, vector<int> newAnts, deadAnts
2011-04-20T09:13:12  <antimatroid> when i move an ant i add it to newAnts, then in my ++ function for state, i process the information from new ants back to ant or dead ants
2011-04-20T09:13:28  <antimatroid> that way in the game tree you can move enemies to collide and make a lot of other stuff simpler
2011-04-20T09:14:33  <antimatroid> an interesting problem i can't work out how to solve is the following:
2011-04-20T09:15:29  <antimatroid> when working out all moves for a set of your ants, you get the set of moves for each ant that doesn't move them to water, then take the cartesian product of those to get the set of all moves, but then you want to efficiently eliminate all elements that result in collisions
2011-04-20T09:16:33  <woudshoo> antimatroid:  That sounds like something that can be done with bit manipulation (Knuth, the art of computer programming Vol 4).  But this is just instinct, no concrete idea.
2011-04-20T09:17:41  <smiley1983> How about something like this: The ant pack is moving toward a destination. Sort the pack by crude distance from the target. Move all the ants whose "best path" is not obstructed. Put their previous locations into a list. Now:
2011-04-20T09:18:27  <woudshoo> Something along the lines of making the ants on the map in bit vectors, create the state after the moves and count the nr of bits.  THis sounds slow, but some the bit manipulations can be very fast.  (although 10000 bits is about 312 4-byte words hm)
2011-04-20T09:18:31  <smiley1983> Iterate over this list of "holes". Attempt to fill the hole with an ant who will improve its position in relation to the target by doing so. Add this ant's previous location to the holes list.
2011-04-20T09:18:34  <antimatroid> here is a nice way of doing it
2011-04-20T09:18:56  <antimatroid> iteratively search from all enemy ants and move the closest ant towards them
2011-04-20T09:19:03  <antimatroid> that would do quite well
2011-04-20T09:19:10  <woudshoo> smiley1983:  Yes, I was thinking about that, but it is work :-(
2011-04-20T09:19:29  <woudshoo> antimatroid: that is what I do now.  But I need to pace my ants, they are now one by one walking into traps.
2011-04-20T09:19:36  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-20T09:19:39  <antimatroid> hence the game tree :P
2011-04-20T09:19:51  <smiley1983> It requires coding work - it probably wouldn't be very processor-intensive.
2011-04-20T09:20:13  <woudshoo> smiley1983: Yes, but my cycles are expensive :-) (and I am lazy)
2011-04-20T09:20:51  <smiley1983> Yes. It's not an approach suited to use within game trees.
2011-04-20T09:25:29  <antimatroid> i'm still not opposed to doing a crazy engine where maps are on a klein bottle
2011-04-20T09:25:35  <jaycobcoleman> I'd like to explore the idea of a school of fish kind of movement, where a group of ants moves as a whole, but forms around enemy ants, just outside their battle radii before simultaniously collapsing onto them.
2011-04-20T09:26:06  <antimatroid> look up swarm intelligence ;)
2011-04-20T09:26:24  <jaycobcoleman> I knew you'd have something for me :)
2011-04-20T09:26:29  <smiley1983> Another possible solution: Attempt to move every ant in the pack, assuming its way will not be blocked by existing ants - only by their destinations. Then sort through this list of orders, discarding all the ones which are impossible because the ant ahead actually couldn't move
2011-04-20T09:27:55  <smiley1983> That has problems of its own, though. Maybe it wouldn't work at all.
2011-04-20T09:28:15  <antimatroid> it'd work
2011-04-20T09:28:29  <antimatroid> you may end up getting stuck with some ants until something else comes into play
2011-04-20T09:29:14  <smiley1983> You'd have to iterate over the list until you didn't cancel any orders
2011-04-20T09:29:14  <smiley1983> Multiple times, that is
2011-04-20T09:30:23  <antimatroid> no, i think you could do it better than that
2011-04-20T09:30:47  <antimatroid> you should be able to do it in a single pass
2011-04-20T09:30:50  <smiley1983> ... by pre-sorting the list by distance?
2011-04-20T09:31:38  <antimatroid> if an ants movement is blocked, revert that ants move and continue reverting moves of any square it lands in
2011-04-20T09:31:51  <antimatroid> you may do more than a single pass, but it wouldn't be a long iterative process
2011-04-20T09:32:10  <antimatroid> i guess it's just changing where the iteration is
2011-04-20T09:33:02  <smiley1983> Yes - it's probably better in many cases, though
2011-04-20T09:33:10  <smiley1983> If it finds the target early
2011-04-20T09:33:39  <smiley1983> "target" being the offending order
2011-04-20T09:37:34  <smiley1983> It's possible that you could build "chains" of linked ants in memory while you make the moves, and then if one gets cancelled, just work your way back along the chain.

2011-04-20T09:52:14  <smiley1983> Allocating memory, initialising data structures perhaps...
2011-04-20T09:52:23  <jaycobcoleman> yes indeed

2011-04-20T09:52:54  <Ice_Harley> how much memory each bot has?
2011-04-20T09:53:59  <jaycobcoleman> I have a considerably faster function that maps the minimum number of moves until an enemy ant can be at each square based on the information I have, which I'll certainly setup at the beginning and then maintain every turn
2011-04-20T09:54:20  <Ice_Harley> saving routing tables from each map location to each should take lot of memory
2011-04-20T09:54:45  <smiley1983> Yes, I've been thinking about that
2011-04-20T09:56:21  <smiley1983> You don't really need each to each, but identifying a subset of vital network nodes is what I'm currently thinking of
2011-04-20T09:57:22  <smiley1983> Then you can do a very short search from current location to nearest node when needed

2011-04-20T10:01:54  <antimatroid> articulation points is wrong
2011-04-20T10:02:04  <antimatroid> find parts that will block those blocks
2011-04-20T10:02:09  <Ice_Harley> in NAlgorithms.h: //returns all mixed strategy Nash equilibria of the given game ....  //haha, good luck writing this  :)
2011-04-20T10:02:17  <antimatroid> due to the wrapping, articulation points are impossible
2011-04-20T10:02:31  <antimatroid> Ice_Harley: are you at all familiar with how hard that is? :P
2011-04-20T10:02:56  <antimatroid> there is no implementation that does it
2011-04-20T10:03:15  <antimatroid> gambit has the best functions, but they aren't perfect
2011-04-20T10:03:44  <antimatroid> the wiki stuff might be helpful :P
2011-04-20T10:04:10  <antimatroid> i'm still adding it to github and not finding a lot of time
2011-04-20T10:05:34  <smiley1983> Can you point me to any reading material about the articulation points you were talking about, or give a very brief run-down on what they are and why they don't work on a toroidal map?
2011-04-20T10:06:16  <antimatroid> an atriculation point is a node that separates a graph if you remove it and all edges it is linked to
2011-04-20T10:06:30  <antimatroid> with the symmetric maps, i'm pretty sure no articulation points will exist
2011-04-20T10:06:38  <antimatroid> and they're slightly painful to find anyway
2011-04-20T10:07:08  <smiley1983> Right. Thankyou :)
2011-04-20T10:07:09  <antimatroid> i think what you really want to do is try to find "passages" such blocks can't traverse through that perhaps a single ant can?
2011-04-20T10:08:15  <antimatroid> an idea i have for going around "traps" is as follows
2011-04-20T10:08:42  <antimatroid> for any square adjacent to an enemy, see if an ant would die in that square if you had ants in any possible squares around it at the end of that turn
2011-04-20T10:08:59  <antimatroid> if it dies no matter what, mark it as a trap square and treat it like water with path finding
2011-04-20T10:11:03  <smiley1983> Will the vision, attack and spawn radii be fixed at some point, or will bots have to cope with a variable input in the final contest?

2011-04-20T10:11:14  <antimatroid> it will be fixed in the final contest
2011-04-20T10:11:19  <antimatroid> but bots should not hard code it
2011-04-20T10:11:24  <antimatroid> at least not until it is finalised
2011-04-20T10:11:43  <antimatroid> the parameters have been added right at the start so people can't bitch about parameters changing if they need to :)
2011-04-20T10:11:57  <antimatroid> you might remember some bots broke when we varied the number of planets on maps in pw
2011-04-20T10:11:57  <smiley1983> Yes, I like that. :)
2011-04-20T10:12:16  <antimatroid> btw how did you like my new maps? :P
2011-04-20T10:12:25  <smiley1983> Ha. Yes.
2011-04-20T10:12:25  <antimatroid> that was my bad
2011-04-20T10:12:32  <smiley1983> New maps for this game or last?
2011-04-20T10:12:37  <antimatroid> planet wars
2011-04-20T10:12:51  <smiley1983> the point symmetry ones?
2011-04-20T10:12:53  <antimatroid> i split the contestants on that one, some loved them, others hated the late change
2011-04-20T10:12:54  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-20T10:13:09  <smiley1983> Sorry, line symmetry.
2011-04-20T10:13:15  <smiley1983> I thought it was... interesting
2011-04-20T10:13:30  <antimatroid> yeah, i didn't know what line/point symmetry was until after i went and made the map gen
2011-04-20T10:13:36  <antimatroid> it's fun solving stuff on your own
2011-04-20T10:13:40  <smiley1983> It did change things a bit, but any bots which couldn't cope had hard-coded unreasonable assumptions.
2011-04-20T10:13:47  <smiley1983> IMHO
2011-04-20T10:13:58  <antimatroid> that was my opinion
2011-04-20T10:14:17  <antimatroid> and i had always assumed maps would change, so imo it was unfair on me to let people get away with assumptions they made
2011-04-20T10:14:30  <smiley1983> It would have been better to have them from the beginning, but I found it interesting and inoffensive.
2011-04-20T10:14:38  <antimatroid> but it was a LATE change, the plan is to not do that again and get variation early on
2011-04-20T10:15:16  <antimatroid> i got paid out for doing it in polar coordinates
2011-04-20T10:15:25  <antimatroid> pesky muggles
2011-04-20T10:15:31  <smiley1983> polar?
2011-04-20T10:15:54  <antimatroid> (r, theta) rather than (x, y)
2011-04-20T10:16:05  <antimatroid> and i would randomly pick r and theta, then convert to x and y
2011-04-20T10:16:32  <antimatroid> but it was like, pick a distance from the center, then pick an angle, then I would do symmetry by translating the angles
2011-04-20T10:17:09  <smiley1983> I have a tendency to change my mind about standards in the middle of a project, and do new stuff the new way without changing all old stuff, and sometimes it leads to big headaches. :)
2011-04-20T10:17:10  <antimatroid> i much prefer the problem of tiling maps on a torus with this
2011-04-20T10:17:28  <antimatroid> i'm like that
2011-04-20T10:17:32  <smiley1983> I like the fact that they specified row, column
2011-04-20T10:17:37  <smiley1983> Saved me from confusing myself
2011-04-20T10:17:42  <antimatroid> you can thank me for that :P
2011-04-20T10:17:49  <smiley1983> Thank you :)
2011-04-20T10:17:49  <antimatroid> it was x,y and i wouldn't shut up about it
2011-04-20T10:17:51  <antimatroid> so it changed
2011-04-20T10:18:02  <antimatroid> x,y indexing is inferior and i actually have a valid argument

2011-04-20T10:18:20  <antimatroid> with x,y indexing, you need to transpose the map when inputting/outputting
2011-04-20T10:18:23  <smiley1983> In that case, than you indeed. Yes, you do. It's faster to print on the screen
2011-04-20T10:18:26  <smiley1983> Yes
2011-04-20T10:18:32  <antimatroid> which is confusing as hell
2011-04-20T10:18:53  <smiley1983> Indeed, that's how I always get into trouble
2011-04-20T10:19:13  <antimatroid> yeah, i cringe, and it wouldn't have been simple to treat the map differently
2011-04-20T10:19:23  <antimatroid> as you would have needed to transpose your directions when outputting moves
2011-04-20T10:19:25  <antimatroid> which is gross
2011-04-20T10:20:05  <smiley1983> You could have made the internal representation correct, then transposed them for ugly starter pack functions, then changed them back to the correct way for your local copy. :)
2011-04-20T10:20:21  <antimatroid> my only last complaint is the fact that we index function graphs as (x,y) the wrong way around
2011-04-20T10:20:31  <antimatroid> matrices, writing on a page, in a file etc. we use row col
2011-04-20T10:20:42  <antimatroid> why for that one thing do we use the opposite?
2011-04-20T10:21:12  <smiley1983> Historical reasons, I guess
2011-04-20T10:21:28  <smiley1983> Like miles :)
2011-04-20T10:21:30  <antimatroid> like the direction of a current :P
2011-04-20T10:22:26  <smiley1983> Do you have a sense of how much work is left to do before beta?

2011-04-20T10:35:08  <antimatroid> look at my c++ bot
2011-04-20T10:35:52  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp/State.cc
2011-04-20T10:35:54  <antimatroid> line 73
2011-04-20T10:36:12  <smiley1983> RIght
2011-04-20T10:36:33  <smiley1983> I searched for a "visible" function and didn't find one, so figured it wasn't there. I'll read that now.
2011-04-20T10:36:35  <antimatroid> what would be an "obvious" improvement would be to add all ants locations to a queue and paint out simultaneously, DON'T do that
2011-04-20T10:36:36  <antimatroid> it breaks
2011-04-20T10:36:57  <antimatroid> the euclidean metric is painful for that
2011-04-20T10:37:43  <antimatroid> it's to do with the fact that
2011-04-20T10:37:43  <antimatroid> a.*
2011-04-20T10:37:43  <antimatroid> .a. are a different distance from * yet the search distance isn't
2011-04-20T10:37:51  <antimatroid> and you can end up having ants block paths etc.
2011-04-20T10:38:06  <antimatroid> sigh is the most knowledgeable on this
2011-04-20T10:38:52  <MatmaRex> hello guys
2011-04-20T10:38:56  <antimatroid> hello
2011-04-20T10:39:12  <MatmaRex> i'm here to write a Ruby starter bot for ants ;)
2011-04-20T10:39:24  <MatmaRex> i suppose i should get this as base? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants
2011-04-20T10:39:52  <MatmaRex> also, is the python bot good to base mine on?
2011-04-20T10:40:33  <antimatroid> i would base it on the c++ one
2011-04-20T10:40:41  <antimatroid> or any of the languages that based it off that
2011-04-20T10:40:52  <smiley1983> Unless it's been fixed, the python one has some errors
2011-04-20T10:40:53  <antimatroid> the python one hasn't been touched in a long time
2011-04-20T10:41:30  <MatmaRex> ah, okay. i'm not sure if i'm comfortable enough with c++ to use that one
2011-04-20T10:41:51  <antimatroid> you are welcome to ask me any questions if you don't understand it
2011-04-20T10:42:00  <antimatroid> but it's mostly pretty simple
2011-04-20T10:42:05  <antimatroid> (i wrote it :))
2011-04-20T10:42:15  <MatmaRex> oh. :)
2011-04-20T10:42:25  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i should really be marking sLoc as visited at the start there :P
2011-04-20T10:42:52  <antimatroid> you could probably pick any of the other languages and be alright too i think
2011-04-20T10:43:02  <smiley1983> I just finished an OCaml one, and I mostly just followed the info on the wiki
2011-04-20T10:43:03  <antimatroid> i just like to push people towards c++ :P
2011-04-20T10:43:08  <MatmaRex> haha
2011-04-20T10:43:20  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i wrote that too, you can't escape me :P
2011-04-20T10:43:50  <antimatroid> actually, you're not allowed to use java
2011-04-20T10:43:50  <smiley1983> The python one is okay for the basic stuff, it just makes some mistakes in setting its init values and some helper functions
2011-04-20T10:43:53  <antimatroid> because java sucks
2011-04-20T10:44:11  <smiley1983> I'm glad to hear another voice saying that :)
2011-04-20T10:44:25  <antimatroid> you'll be begging me to stop saying it if you hang around :P
2011-04-20T10:44:41  <antimatroid> i'm slowly trying to learn haskell, i have had enough of c++
2011-04-20T10:46:07  <smiley1983> I've heard Haskell shares OCaml's functional philosophy (though takes it a bit further) so I'm inclined to think well of it.
2011-04-20T10:47:46  <smiley1983> I like OCaml because it provides OO and procedural options, but nudges users in the direction of functional programming with nice List.fold_left more
2011-04-20T10:49:22  <aerique> antimatroid: pfff, I've been doing some C++ lately and I'd be nowhere without valgrind
2011-04-20T10:49:52  <aerique> antimatroid: it's too hard for me :)
2011-04-20T10:50:00  <antimatroid> aerique: i've been told to use valgrind but never have
2011-04-20T10:50:20  <antimatroid> i don't even know how to use proper debuggers :P
2011-04-20T10:50:30  <antimatroid> i still use the cout method of debugging :P

2011-04-20T11:10:15  <smiley1983> The scroll bar visibility should be fixable by fiddling with themes or suchlike
2011-04-20T11:10:35  <antimatroid> but i like this theme :(
2011-04-20T11:11:02  <smiley1983> I'm running Arch with openbox, no desktop environment, and my scroll bars are nice and visible. :)

2011-04-20T11:12:53  <aerique> i prefer a pretty bare linux and x as well
2011-04-20T11:13:52  <antimatroid> yeah, i have all those "special effects" things off
2011-04-20T11:14:06  <antimatroid> i like to use my resources on useful stuff
2011-04-20T11:14:27  <aerique> but you're probably still running Gnome or some other desktop environment?
2011-04-20T11:14:33  <antimatroid> probably
2011-04-20T11:14:36  <aerique> argh, i gotta go
2011-04-20T11:14:41  <antimatroid> (i have no idea about this stuff :P)
2011-04-20T11:14:43  <antimatroid> see ya

2011-04-20T11:15:47  <antimatroid> smiley1983: so what did you do for your planet wars strategy?
2011-04-20T11:15:49  <smiley1983> It's responsible for much of the integration of desktop features - plug in a USB stick, get an icon on your desktop. Move into range of a wireless connection, offer a wireless dialog
2011-04-20T11:16:05  <antimatroid> i basically defended anything i could from getting claimed, then used a game tree
2011-04-20T11:16:07  <smiley1983> Um. I fiddled around with stuff and experimented.
2011-04-20T11:16:21  <antimatroid> the game tree was very broken
2011-04-20T11:16:23  <smiley1983> I ended up with a messy pile of heuristics
2011-04-20T11:16:37  <antimatroid> but not much better when it wasn't as broken
2011-04-20T11:16:45  <antimatroid> if not worse :P
2011-04-20T11:17:45  <smiley1983> I had a bunch of simulation functions, like a lot of people did. What happens if all planets launch all ships at one planet. Use ownership change points to prevent losses, find easy gains
2011-04-20T11:18:05  <antimatroid> a "move" in my game tree was sending enough ships from any number of planets either now or in the future so that the player couldn't possibly own it when my last lot of ships arrive
2011-04-20T11:18:24  <antimatroid> *to one planet
2011-04-20T11:18:41  <smiley1983> Yes, I devoted a lot of time to trying to get that right, and I don't think I ever did perfectly for all cases.
2011-04-20T11:19:15  <antimatroid> i also had a "big first move" function where sometimes i would send everything to the middle on the first turn
2011-04-20T11:19:20  <antimatroid> people laughed, but it worked for me
2011-04-20T11:19:22  <smiley1983> I came into the contest a few weeks in, not really intending to get as drawn into it as I did. I didn't build my simulation structure properly from the beginning.
2011-04-20T11:19:37  <antimatroid> i did multiple rewrites, so many bugs
2011-04-20T11:19:53  <smiley1983> Yes, me too
2011-04-20T11:20:02  <smiley1983> Some I never fixed
2011-04-20T11:20:55  <smiley1983> I backtracked my last several days of coding and entered an earlier version in the contest because it seemed to be performing better, but I'll never know if that was the right decision

2011-04-20T11:22:09  <antimatroid> i did an all nighter, then on the morning decided on a completely new idea for my game tree, implemented it wrong and submitted it :P

2011-04-20T11:22:29  <antimatroid> it was leaking memory in fact :P
2011-04-20T11:22:45  <smiley1983> It performed well
2011-04-20T11:22:53  <antimatroid> i know, i was shocked
2011-04-20T11:22:59  <antimatroid> it still makes me laugh
2011-04-20T11:23:01  <smiley1983> Though perhaps could have performed even better?
2011-04-20T11:23:06  <antimatroid> don't think so
2011-04-20T11:23:10  <smiley1983> Right
2011-04-20T11:23:22  <antimatroid> that problem stumped me (and everyone else)
2011-04-20T11:23:37  <antimatroid> it was a cool problem though
2011-04-20T11:23:50  <smiley1983> There was one bug I fixed - a clear, definite mistake - and after fixing, the bot became much weaker
2011-04-20T11:23:56  <antimatroid> i worked with a friend on our tron bot
2011-04-20T11:24:02  <antimatroid> that we expected to finish top 10
2011-04-20T11:24:19  <smiley1983> The error was making it overly aggressive in certain situations, hence the superior performance :)
2011-04-20T11:24:21  <antimatroid> and it was sitting around there more than a day into the contest before we got disqualified for timing out on one turn in one game
2011-04-20T11:24:31  <antimatroid> i didn't shut up until that rule was changed for planet wars
2011-04-20T11:24:38  <antimatroid> i didn't even realise it was a rule until it happened
2011-04-20T11:24:54  <smiley1983> I was surprised to read that they were so harsh about disqualifying
2011-04-20T11:25:04  <smiley1983> I didn't know about the tron contest when it was on
2011-04-20T11:25:04  <antimatroid> yeah that was devestating
2011-04-20T11:25:20  <smiley1983> I can only imagine, after all the work which must have gone in
2011-04-20T11:25:31  <antimatroid> that was only 3 weeks, but still
2011-04-20T11:25:55  <antimatroid> an unnecessarily harsh rule is what i call it
2011-04-20T11:26:51  <smiley1983> Yes. Besides, looking at the lower ranks was funny in Planetwars, all the races to crash last.
2011-04-20T11:28:00  <antimatroid> planet wars on a directed graph with a fog of war would be cool
2011-04-20T11:28:06  <antimatroid> because the map would have sink holes
2011-04-20T11:28:16  <antimatroid> where you go down that edge and can't get back to the rest of the graph
2011-04-20T11:29:02  <smiley1983> Did any form of planet wars server or development occur after the contest?
2011-04-20T11:30:22  <antimatroid> what do you mean?
2011-04-20T11:30:32  <antimatroid> after the contest everyone basically lost interest
2011-04-20T11:30:36  <smiley1983> Like an ongoing TCP server
2011-04-20T11:30:45  <smiley1983> Yes, I guess that was inevitable
2011-04-20T11:30:46  <antimatroid> zeroviz was up for a while
2011-04-20T11:30:49  <antimatroid> but not overly used

2011-04-20T17:48:23  <Dolkar> hello there... anyone here? I've got a food spawning idea i want to share :)
2011-04-20T17:52:43  <Dolkar> Basically.. You will spawn food in given range from starting point of every player equally and maybe also in the center of map. This way, everyone will try to get to the center first, which might result into a pretty nice watch. At the same time, you will have to protect and salvage your starting point against enemies, which will add a bit more strategy into the game: finding the best
2011-04-20T17:52:44  <Dolkar> ratio between defense and offense.
2011-04-20T17:56:19  <a1k0n> yeah, more like mineral patches in starcraft, etc.  so you have to take and hold "bases" instead of randomly hunting
2011-04-20T18:00:08  <Dolkar> ... and since you will need to move 'newly produced ants' into the battle, you can even pick on them and cut of the army from support

2011-04-20T18:00:57  <Dolkar> I would like to see tron back anyways...
2011-04-20T18:01:56  <amstan> Dolkar: since the map is wrapped around, any point can be the center of the map
2011-04-20T18:02:01  <amstan> also.. doing that will make it unfair
2011-04-20T18:02:19  <amstan> because not all players are equally spaced from the center of the map
2011-04-20T18:02:27  <Dolkar> hm.. forgot about the wrapping
2011-04-20T18:03:17  <Dolkar> amstan: You can count the center point of the players' starting point
2011-04-20T18:04:36  <Dolkar> By the way, wrapping ruins even more... it will be hard, for example, to count distance between two points. If it was me, I would get rid of the wrapping
2011-04-20T18:05:01  <amstan> you can't do 7 player maps without the wrapping
2011-04-20T18:05:24  <amstan> counting distance is not our problem, it's the bot's
2011-04-20T18:05:25  <Dolkar> Why not? if they are big enough...
2011-04-20T18:05:30  <a1k0n> make the map a giant regular heptagon?
2011-04-20T18:05:41  <amstan> a1k0n: using integer positions?
2011-04-20T18:05:54  <a1k0n> yeah it'd be a little funky
2011-04-20T18:06:05  <amstan> won't be symmetric anymore
2011-04-20T18:06:20  <a1k0n> it'd be symmetric
2011-04-20T18:06:32  <a1k0n> plus or minus epsilon due to integer quantization
2011-04-20T18:06:47  <amstan> epsilon should be 0
2011-04-20T18:06:52  <Dolkar> Doesn't need to be symmetric and still be fair...
2011-04-20T18:07:30  <a1k0n> uniform spawning is "fair", except it means a slight toehold grows exponentially as an advantage
2011-04-20T18:07:45  <a1k0n> it's hard to quantify what's fair in those terms
2011-04-20T18:09:22  <Dolkar> Anyways, any slight random unfairness will get lost with number of matches
2011-04-20T18:09:40  <a1k0n> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Food-Spawning
2011-04-20T18:09:51  <a1k0n> your proposal is close to #2
2011-04-20T18:10:30  <a1k0n> if additional "base" locations are found with N-fold symmetry with N players, it's fair enough.  the games are going to be very stochastic.
2011-04-20T18:10:41  <a1k0n> with random food spawning at all, there's no way to be completely fair
2011-04-20T18:11:02  <a1k0n> player 1 might get food dropped on him on the first turn while other players don't for a while, and he has twice as many ants as everyone else then

2011-04-20T18:11:56  <amstan> that's why i disagree to use random spawns
2011-04-20T18:11:58  <Dolkar> of course, the distribution will be equal in those bases
2011-04-20T18:12:01  <amstan> or random everything
2011-04-20T18:12:05  <amstan> however small it looks
2011-04-20T18:12:07  <a1k0n> so, symmetric spawning?
2011-04-20T18:12:10  <amstan> anything*
2011-04-20T18:12:21  <amstan> a1k0n: yes, but we have 2 types of symmetries
2011-04-20T18:12:32  <amstan> antimatroid only describes the one used for his mapgen
2011-04-20T18:12:55  <Dolkar> No... Just an equal number of spawned foods in each of the players' bases each turn
2011-04-20T18:13:32  <Dolkar> + into the center one (ones)
2011-04-20T18:14:39  <Dolkar> By the way... please sorry my english, its not my native...
2011-04-20T18:15:23  <a1k0n> haha.  your english was totally fine until that sentence.
2011-04-20T18:16:10  <Dolkar> Is that sentence wrong in some way?
2011-04-20T18:16:47  <a1k0n> sorry is not really a verb.  excuse, perhaps?
2011-04-20T18:17:43  <Dolkar> Ah... thanks a lot :) I think i heard sentences like 'Sorry me...' and such though...

2011-04-20T19:19:54  * antimatroid really likes having wrapped edges
2011-04-20T19:20:02  <antimatroid> it means you are basically surrounded on all sides
2011-04-20T19:20:13  <antimatroid> and calculating distances between squares, while slightly harder, is not difficult
2011-04-20T19:22:10  <antimatroid> i too am against asymmetry though
2011-04-20T19:25:44  <jaycobcoleman> I am quite against asymmetry
2011-04-20T19:26:31  <jaycobcoleman> Because it means I can't compare samples from areas I'm aware of and determine everyone else's starting positions :P
2011-04-20T19:26:49  <antimatroid> how are starting positions going to help you later in the game?
2011-04-20T19:27:31  <jaycobcoleman> being aware of your safe starting area could be very important to determining how far you want to spread in search of food and how quickly
2011-04-20T19:28:00  <antimatroid> strategies like that can be effective on some maps, but not others
2011-04-20T19:28:10  <antimatroid> i prefer to write a strategy that is more general than that
2011-04-20T19:28:12  <Dolkar> Maps can be asymmetric and still fair if the maps were more open
2011-04-20T19:28:27  <antimatroid> Dolkar: but we want a large variety of maps
2011-04-20T19:28:31  <antimatroid> both closed off and open
2011-04-20T19:28:55  <antimatroid> and testing on asymmetric maps is much harder
2011-04-20T19:29:03  <jaycobcoleman> Just to throw people off we should have one map with no water
2011-04-20T19:29:04  <antimatroid> or working out whether you actually performed better than another bot in a game
2011-04-20T19:29:09  <antimatroid> i really don't like asymmetry
2011-04-20T19:29:14  <Dolkar> antimatroid: I know.. you can make those open maps asymmetric... to somehow destroy such tactics relying on symmetry
2011-04-20T19:29:34  <antimatroid> Dolkar: a better way to destroy symmetry tactics is to have lots of symmetry types
2011-04-20T19:29:38  <Dolkar> jaycobcoleman: or no land :)
2011-04-20T19:29:55  <antimatroid> we can do a different symmetry with 2^n player maps
2011-04-20T19:29:58  <antimatroid> i will do that at some point
2011-04-20T19:30:04  <jaycobcoleman> I like the idea of a single winding stretch of land

2011-04-20T19:43:57  <bhasker> btw antimatroid
2011-04-20T19:44:24  <bhasker> how is battle resolution done, do i just walk through ants and distribute 1/n dmg to all ants in its vicinity and then eliminate the ants that take more than 1 damage
2011-04-20T19:44:38  <antimatroid> all ants that take at least one damage
2011-04-20T19:44:39  <antimatroid> but yeah
2011-04-20T19:44:42  <bhasker> i am trying to come up with a function that does local battle resolution
2011-04-20T19:44:46  <bhasker> so that i can evaluate moves
2011-04-20T19:45:03  <antimatroid> yeah, i have a state++ function, except i haven't done damage battle resolution yet
2011-04-20T19:45:08  <bhasker> i wonder if i should just resolve all battles
2011-04-20T19:45:18  <antimatroid> need that to do state evaluation in my game trees
2011-04-20T19:45:20  <bhasker> instead of trying to resolve the specific battle
2011-04-20T19:45:33  <a1k0n> what does the actual engine do?
2011-04-20T19:45:34  <Dolkar> is the damage needed to be dealt that turn? Or ants have something like HP? If so.. does it regenerate?
2011-04-20T19:45:46  <antimatroid> a1k0n: it's open source if you want to look :P
2011-04-20T19:45:48  <bhasker> ants have 1 hp and it regenerates to full every turn
2011-04-20T19:45:54  <a1k0n> i can't get the python one to work
2011-04-20T19:45:59  <antimatroid> Dolkar: battle is stateless
2011-04-20T19:46:06  <a1k0n> lots of syntax errors
2011-04-20T19:46:09  <antimatroid> a1k0n: use python 2.7
2011-04-20T19:46:10  <jaycobcoleman> a1k0n: what isn't working
2011-04-20T19:46:11  <antimatroid> not 3.1
2011-04-20T19:46:17  <bhasker> or 2.5
2011-04-20T19:46:19  <a1k0n> oh.  i didn't know there was a 2.7.  i have 2.6.
2011-04-20T19:46:24  <bhasker> 2.6 works fine
2011-04-20T19:46:31  <bhasker> on my macbook
2011-04-20T19:46:32  <antimatroid> might not be 2.7, i don't know much about python
2011-04-20T19:46:38  <antimatroid> but i know >3 doesn't work
2011-04-20T19:46:38  <jaycobcoleman> 2. 6 should be fine
2011-04-20T19:46:44  <Dolkar> 2.7 is a mix of 2 and 3...
2011-04-20T19:46:54  <antimatroid> a1k0n: have you run the play_one_game script?
2011-04-20T19:47:08  <a1k0n> that's what i was trying to run.  and now it works, because i did a python_select python26.
2011-04-20T19:47:11  <a1k0n> apparently it was running 2.4.
2011-04-20T19:47:12  <a1k0n> doh.
2011-04-20T19:47:14  <jaycobcoleman> 2. 7 hasn't eliminated the deprecated modules yet
2011-04-20T19:47:39  <antimatroid> okay, then grab the replay data out of the replay file in viewer directory, and paste it once you open copy_paste.html in viewer
2011-04-20T19:47:40  <antimatroid> and voila
2011-04-20T19:47:52  <bhasker> evaluation function in this will be harder for state
2011-04-20T19:47:53  <antimatroid> now bring it on :P
2011-04-20T19:47:56  <bhasker> since unlike planetwars
2011-04-20T19:48:03  <bhasker> one doesn't have complete data
2011-04-20T19:48:08  <a1k0n> hmm, doing incremental battle resolution on proposed moves could be tricky.
2011-04-20T19:48:15  <antimatroid> screw worrying about state evaluation
2011-04-20T19:48:28  <a1k0n> might have to limit the resolution to some radius around the ant-to-move or something
2011-04-20T19:48:32  <bhasker> but then how do you evaluate your tree?
2011-04-20T19:48:33  <antimatroid> be more worried about how you're going to do backward induction on an n-player non-zero sum game tree
2011-04-20T19:48:42  <antimatroid> you have many options depending on how much you want to cooperate :)
2011-04-20T19:49:13  <jaycobcoleman> this is the only game theory concept I currently have a decent hold on
2011-04-20T19:49:21  <antimatroid> a1k0n: i'm going to just do all moves for ants, and evaluate the terminal nodes
2011-04-20T19:49:25  <a1k0n> this game makes a lot more sense to do genetic programming on
2011-04-20T19:49:37  <a1k0n> fair enough.  that sounds painful though.
2011-04-20T19:49:54  <a1k0n> unless you break ants into small groups or something.
2011-04-20T19:49:55  <antimatroid> why?
2011-04-20T19:50:06  <antimatroid> yeah, i will partition them into sets of ants that can affect each other
2011-04-20T19:50:09  <a1k0n> well, a game tree search doing that has a whole lot of fan-out
2011-04-20T19:50:14  <antimatroid> then just do as many of those trees as i can
2011-04-20T19:50:19  <a1k0n> makes sense
2011-04-20T19:50:36  <antimatroid> then probably move the rest of my "battle ants" towards their closest friend or something
2011-04-20T19:50:54  <jaycobcoleman> a1k0n: What's your background prior to the last competition?
2011-04-20T19:51:00  <antimatroid> he won tron :P
2011-04-20T19:51:29  <a1k0n> yeah, then i made some lame heuristic bot for planetwars that was, due to sheer luck, in #1 for the first week or two of the planetwars contest
2011-04-20T19:51:32  <antimatroid> http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/rankings.php
2011-04-20T19:51:33  <a1k0n> then i played minecraft
2011-04-20T19:52:04  <a1k0n> but anyway, i don't have a good answer to "what's your background".  i dropped out of college to do a video game startup (vendetta-online.com) and taught myself a bunch of stuff
2011-04-20T19:52:09  <jaycobcoleman> oh, sorry. I meant prior to tron
2011-04-20T19:52:41  <jaycobcoleman> also, love minecraft
2011-04-20T19:52:41  <a1k0n> currently i do machine learning for anti-abuse purposes and user prediction stuff
2011-04-20T19:52:49  <jaycobcoleman> 1.5
2011-04-20T19:53:45  <a1k0n> and... i gotta go
2011-04-20T19:54:18  <jaycobcoleman> see ya
2011-04-20T19:54:35  <antimatroid> bhasker: as for evaluating trees... you have a few options
2011-04-20T19:55:00  <bhasker> like
2011-04-20T19:55:15  <antimatroid> if you don't want to cooperate, bring up the best payoff for the player whose node it is, then the worst for each other players
2011-04-20T19:55:23  <a1k0n> (also i work with bhasker)
2011-04-20T19:55:39  <antimatroid> if you want to cooperate, bring up the best payoff for any drawing best node of the player whose making the decision
2011-04-20T19:55:57  <antimatroid> or if you want to get really technical, use tit for tat as to who you will cooperate with in your tree
2011-04-20T19:56:08  <antimatroid> but it wont be easy working out who did and didn't cooperate
2011-04-20T19:56:17  <bhasker> hmm k
2011-04-20T19:56:37  <bhasker> i guess the problem comes from you not knowing how much losing those ants matters to your enemies
2011-04-20T19:56:40  <bhasker> or which enemy
2011-04-20T19:56:43  <jaycobcoleman> I fiddle with creating opponent classes, but I think I'm abandoning that idea
2011-04-20T19:56:49  <bhasker> since you don't know completely how many ants each one has
2011-04-20T19:57:04  <bhasker> so in some case it might be better to battle the weaker and run from the stronger etc
2011-04-20T19:57:05  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure if you don't want to worry about cooperation, you can basically treat all enemy ants as working collectively against you as one player, but having to worry about the different ant label with battle resolution
2011-04-20T19:57:15  <bhasker> so that you can gain territory
2011-04-20T19:57:24  <jaycobcoleman> You can make a good guess by the amount you've encountered and your awareness of the map
2011-04-20T19:57:36  <bhasker> i guess some probability model makes sense
2011-04-20T19:57:46  <bhasker> i think i will calculate per turn how much of the map is visible
2011-04-20T19:58:11  <bhasker> and use that as a way to gauge approximate value of each enemy but its still kind of hand wavy
2011-04-20T19:58:33  <antimatroid> bhasker: you also don't know how good they are
2011-04-20T19:58:42  <bhasker> true
2011-04-20T19:58:52  <antimatroid> with zero sum, the terminal node that gets predicted is the worst outcome you can get playing your strategy
2011-04-20T19:59:05  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: that was also intended to be in the opponent class that isn't happening
2011-04-20T19:59:06  <antimatroid> this is no longer the case with non-zero sum, as their loss is not necessarily your gain
2011-04-20T20:00:08  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-20T20:00:29  <antimatroid> shall make it quite interesting i think
2011-04-20T20:01:07  <jaycobcoleman> bhasker: to be more accurate you can map the minimum number of moves based only on the information you have till an enemy could be on each square, then each turn  -1 from each element and overlay the new data. Then you get more information than only what is currently visible to you
2011-04-20T20:01:45  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: that's quite neat
2011-04-20T20:01:45  <bhasker> not sure i follow you jay
2011-04-20T20:01:48  <antimatroid> i hadn't thought of that
2011-04-20T20:01:56  <jaycobcoleman> I acutally have this implemented already
2011-04-20T20:02:03  <antimatroid> that's super neat
2011-04-20T20:02:14  <jaycobcoleman> why thank you  :)
2011-04-20T20:02:41  <bhasker> you calculate how many move sit will take an emeny to take over your whole territory?
2011-04-20T20:02:51  <antimatroid> actually, how do you handle dead ants?
2011-04-20T20:03:08  <jaycobcoleman> what do you mean?
2011-04-20T20:03:09  <bhasker> not sure i follow the overlay part
2011-04-20T20:03:13  <antimatroid> or ants they may be dead or alive, as they're no longer in view
2011-04-20T20:03:30  <jaycobcoleman> I see. I'm not sure yet. Imperfect system. In production
2011-04-20T20:03:45  <jaycobcoleman> I think I'm going to assume they're allive
2011-04-20T20:03:50  <jaycobcoleman> *alive
2011-04-20T20:04:28  *** Dolkar <Dolkar!~Dolkar@81.19.35.158> has quit IRC ()
2011-04-20T20:04:28  <antimatroid> actually, i don't think it really works the way i thought :p
2011-04-20T20:04:35  <jaycobcoleman> Yeah that would definitely work, because it's only a minimum value
2011-04-20T20:04:40  <antimatroid> actually, yeah
2011-04-20T20:05:13  <antimatroid> i'm unsure about how correct it would be
2011-04-20T20:05:29  *** Ttech <Ttech!ttech@botters/staff/ttech> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-20T20:05:33  <jaycobcoleman> In my experience its been quite useful
2011-04-20T20:06:01  <antimatroid> i would be inclined to just make the map each turn
2011-04-20T20:06:09  <jaycobcoleman> just to get a fuller picture of the map than you can see
2011-04-20T20:07:23  <jaycobcoleman> It would provide an incentive to send out scout ants to gather more information, which would simply avoid a battle at all costs and always move towards the areas of the map with less known information
2011-04-20T20:08:21  <antimatroid> i don't like assigning roles to ants
2011-04-20T20:08:32  <antimatroid> i start afresh each turn
2011-04-20T20:08:40  <antimatroid> you could plop my bot into the middle of a game and it'd just run
2011-04-20T20:08:41  <jaycobcoleman> I've been toying with the idea of it
2011-04-20T20:09:14  <jaycobcoleman> I'll certainly experiment with both
2011-04-20T20:10:21  <bhasker> so question if have 2 ants of mine in range with 2 enemy ants so all 4 are in same range how much dmg does each ant take?
2011-04-20T20:10:48  <jaycobcoleman> should be one each
2011-04-20T20:11:10  <bhasker> so each friendly ant will dish 1/2 dmg to each of the enemy ants
2011-04-20T20:11:14  <bhasker> and vice versa right
2011-04-20T20:11:20  <jaycobcoleman> yes
2011-04-20T20:11:48  <antimatroid> and all 4 ants die
2011-04-20T20:14:01  <jaycobcoleman> I'm considering taking a year off to do an internship or two and learn vast amounts of programming after I finish my required education.
2011-04-20T20:14:25  <antimatroid> don't
2011-04-20T20:14:32  <jaycobcoleman> why's that?
2011-04-20T20:14:41  <antimatroid> just get college over and done with
2011-04-20T20:14:48  <bhasker> you will never learn vast amounts of programming
2011-04-20T20:14:50  <antimatroid> you have long summers you can intern over
2011-04-20T20:15:01  <bhasker> you will probably end up just fixing bugs
2011-04-20T20:15:19  <antimatroid> or wose
2011-04-20T20:15:20  <bhasker> or maintaining a system that no one cares about:)
2011-04-20T20:15:39  <bhasker> its rare that you will get a really great internship project that too an year long
2011-04-20T20:16:28  <jaycobcoleman> The internships weren't really meant to be so connected with the learning vast amount of programming
2011-04-20T20:16:36  <jaycobcoleman> that's what I'll do on my own time
2011-04-20T20:16:54  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-20T20:17:04  <antimatroid> you can do that while at college
2011-04-20T20:17:11  <antimatroid> the first couple of years of classes are pretty breezy
2011-04-20T20:17:36  <jaycobcoleman> Yeah but I'm poor. I need money for college and I'm not getting a loan
2011-04-20T20:17:44  <antimatroid> you in the us?
2011-04-20T20:17:49  <jaycobcoleman> yeah
2011-04-20T20:17:54  <jaycobcoleman> Alaska
2011-04-20T20:18:30  <antimatroid> i'll be $35k in debt at the end of this year, but I don't have to pay a cent back until I start earning over $40k a year and the only iterest is it being pegged to cpi
2011-04-20T20:19:12  <antimatroid> do you have the marks for a scholarship?
2011-04-20T20:19:52  <antimatroid> the problem with inflated grades these days is you don't get the smartest kids with the highest grades pre uni, just those who put the most effort in
2011-04-20T20:19:57  <jaycobcoleman> Not the marks, but I've won competitions and such
2011-04-20T20:20:27  <jaycobcoleman> yeah I'm in all very advanced classes but don't get very good grades :p
2011-04-20T20:20:38  <antimatroid> that's a lot like me
2011-04-20T20:20:45  <antimatroid> but you need to pick the grades up at uni
2011-04-20T20:21:12  <jaycobcoleman> I think the fact that I'll be paying/working for it might help
2011-04-20T20:21:18  <antimatroid> if you take the harder classes as early as possible, the rest of them become fairly easy though
2011-04-20T20:21:53  <antimatroid> although you end up replacing a lot of the easier ones with even harder ones you wouldn't have imagined doing
2011-04-20T20:21:55  <antimatroid> but that's a good thing
2011-04-20T20:21:56  <bhasker> where in alaska jaycob, was there last year, beautiful place
2011-04-20T20:22:15  <bhasker> did a week long trip of alaska just not enough, have to go back for a 3-4 week trip
2011-04-20T20:22:16  <jaycobcoleman> Anchorage. Where nearly everyone is :)
2011-04-20T20:22:21  <bhasker> ah
2011-04-20T20:22:33  <bhasker> we flew into anchorage, went to seward then back upto denali
2011-04-20T20:22:37  <bhasker> and back to anchorage
2011-04-20T20:22:52  <bhasker> couldn't make it to fairbanks or valdez etc, maybe next trip
2011-04-20T20:23:02  <jmcarthur> college is overrated
2011-04-20T20:23:15  <bhasker> i am not so sure about that statement
2011-04-20T20:23:17  <jaycobcoleman> talking to someone who's about to have a baby fills me with nostalgia
2011-04-20T20:23:24  <jaycobcoleman> fairbanks is nice
2011-04-20T20:23:33  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: depends on the course, college and person :P
2011-04-20T20:23:34  <jaycobcoleman> seward smells like shit
2011-04-20T20:23:49  <bhasker> though the train ride to seward is outstanding
2011-04-20T20:24:02  <bhasker> i loved it , compared to the train ride to denali
2011-04-20T20:24:02  <jaycobcoleman> I haven't taken it
2011-04-20T20:24:03  <jmcarthur> my problem with uni is that it seems like they try to be all things to all people
2011-04-20T20:24:05  <bhasker> which is boring as hell
2011-04-20T20:24:20  <bhasker> we took trains in the full dome cars to seward and to denali
2011-04-20T20:24:27  <bhasker> it was one of the best train rides i have taken
2011-04-20T20:24:30  <jaycobcoleman> I did a bus ride through denali. It was terrible
2011-04-20T20:24:31  <bhasker> the views are just outstanding
2011-04-20T20:24:31  <jmcarthur> people go in with all kinds of wild expectations, and the uni tries to meet their insane demands
2011-04-20T20:24:51  <jmcarthur> while at the same time making money
2011-04-20T20:25:00  <antimatroid> yep, i think it should be a crime how low the entry requirements are for engineering at my university
2011-04-20T20:25:07  <antimatroid> the drop out rate is like 50% in first year
2011-04-20T20:25:17  <bhasker> antimatroid i think thats a problem with higher education in a lot of places
2011-04-20T20:25:20  <antimatroid> people go in with no idea of what the degree entails
2011-04-20T20:25:27  <jmcarthur> so it has to be attractive, apparently inexpensive, easy to stay in, not scary, etc.
2011-04-20T20:25:31  <bhasker> but i think still some of the nicer institutions aren't that easy to get into
2011-04-20T20:25:31  <jaycobcoleman> Living in Alaska makes you not appreciate its beauty. At least for most people
2011-04-20T20:25:34  *** FireFly <FireFly!~firefly@unaffiliated/firefly> has quit IRC (Quit: swatted to death)
2011-04-20T20:25:47  <antimatroid> i like university for what it's meant to be, a higher learning institution
2011-04-20T20:25:50  <jaycobcoleman> partly cause the fact that it's always cold is annoying as hell
2011-04-20T20:25:54  <antimatroid> i am very against most other aspects they have become
2011-04-20T20:25:55  <bhasker> that i agree
2011-04-20T20:25:56  <jmcarthur> and then there's the negative stigma that vocational schools have
2011-04-20T20:26:02  <bhasker> it is cold there:)
2011-04-20T20:26:12  <jmcarthur> people think they have to go to *uni* because ITT tech isn't prestigious enough
2011-04-20T20:26:13  <bhasker> i love the california weather
2011-04-20T20:26:17  <jaycobcoleman> well it isn't always cold, but winter is like 8 months out of the year
2011-04-20T20:26:19  <antimatroid> yeah i don't like that either
2011-04-20T20:26:23  <antimatroid> most of my friends are tradies
2011-04-20T20:26:41  <jmcarthur> and then uni gets bogged down with non-academic stuff
2011-04-20T20:26:46  <jaycobcoleman> Is a substantial amount of this group from australia?
2011-04-20T20:26:47  <bhasker> anchorage weather is kinda lousy though
2011-04-20T20:26:50  <bhasker> keeps raining all the time
2011-04-20T20:26:50  <jmcarthur> and vocational schools get no recognition at all
2011-04-20T20:26:55  <antimatroid> my university souly cares about being a business
2011-04-20T20:26:58  <jaycobcoleman> lousy indeed
2011-04-20T20:27:12  <bhasker> next time though i also want to goto kenai peninsula
2011-04-20T20:27:13  <jmcarthur> they have to keep their attendence up
2011-04-20T20:27:17  <bhasker> and see the big salmon eating grizzlies
2011-04-20T20:27:31  <jaycobcoleman> eh. Actually not so much rain.
2011-04-20T20:27:31  <antimatroid> yes, but imo it should be run like a business with academic interests in mind
2011-04-20T20:27:36  <antimatroid> my university misses that last part
2011-04-20T20:27:38  <jmcarthur> there's not philosophy that "everybody needs higher education!"
2011-04-20T20:27:42  <jmcarthur> s/not/this/
2011-04-20T20:27:47  <jmcarthur> not sure where "not" came from
2011-04-20T20:28:11  <bhasker> jmc i think most people do need higher education, at least 4 yrs after school
2011-04-20T20:28:15  <jmcarthur> i'd rather the quality of basic education be better
2011-04-20T20:28:16  <bhasker> school just doesn't prepare you
2011-04-20T20:28:21  <antimatroid> the maths and physics department is great, and there's some great people in other departments, but other than that I despise my uni
2011-04-20T20:28:23  <bhasker> MS maybe not
2011-04-20T20:28:42  <antimatroid> i didn't pay attention much before uni, i have very large gaps of knowledge
2011-04-20T20:28:46  <bhasker> K+12 doesn't give you enough to go do a job in the real world
2011-04-20T20:28:56  <antimatroid> depends on what job
2011-04-20T20:28:57  <jmcarthur> *our* K-12 program sucks
2011-04-20T20:29:10  <bhasker> well i studied in india and it ain't much better there
2011-04-20T20:29:13  <jaycobcoleman> who is *our*?
2011-04-20T20:29:18  <jmcarthur> US
2011-04-20T20:29:29  <jaycobcoleman> Oh, where are you from?
2011-04-20T20:29:30  <bhasker> india is in the same bubble
2011-04-20T20:29:40  <antimatroid> a lot of my friends were able to do a vocational building program at the start of year 11 and just transition to an apprenticeship that year
2011-04-20T20:29:42  <jmcarthur> i'm in alabama
2011-04-20T20:29:48  <jaycobcoleman> bhasker: where do you live?
2011-04-20T20:29:49  <bhasker> bachelors' isnt good enough to find jobs, unless its an engineering bachelors
2011-04-20T20:29:50  <jmcarthur> but this really just applies across the country, IMO
2011-04-20T20:29:52  <bhasker> bay area
2011-04-20T20:30:01  <bhasker> but i am in indian
2011-04-20T20:30:11  <bhasker> so studied/lived most of my life in india
2011-04-20T20:30:13  <jmcarthur> i have a bachelors and none of my employers have cared at all
2011-04-20T20:30:15  <antimatroid> am in indian :P
2011-04-20T20:30:15  <bhasker> moved to the US only 4 yrs ago
2011-04-20T20:30:22  <jmcarthur> i'm just as well off with no degree
2011-04-20T20:30:24  *** needsch <needsch!~Robert@ip-81-210-159-12.unitymediagroup.de> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2011-04-20T20:30:34  <bhasker> well i don't think its the fact that employers care
2011-04-20T20:30:45  <bhasker> its just that school just doesn't teach you what a bachelors does
2011-04-20T20:30:48  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i think with cs/programming the perceived need of a degree by a lot of people is far too high
2011-04-20T20:30:55  <bhasker> and more importantly it gives you the time to deeply explore certain areas
2011-04-20T20:31:01  <bhasker> which school doesn't
2011-04-20T20:31:05  <antimatroid> but for things like physics/maths/engineering/economics etc. an undergraduate degree is necessary
2011-04-20T20:31:08  <jmcarthur> i learned almost zero from my uni
2011-04-20T20:31:26  <antimatroid> yes, uni is not necessary for learning programming
2011-04-20T20:31:30  <bhasker> the problem with CS/programming is most uni's have horrible profs
2011-04-20T20:31:33  <jmcarthur> i learned the most programming on my own time
2011-04-20T20:31:33  <antimatroid> and too many people think it is
2011-04-20T20:31:36  <bhasker> since anyone worth anything is out making money
2011-04-20T20:31:39  <bhasker> in the real world
2011-04-20T20:31:46  <jmcarthur> heck, even the K-12 program taught me more programming than my BS did
2011-04-20T20:31:58  <jaycobcoleman> Meh. Two years of Calculus and AP Physics. I feels like that's good enough for any practical application of math
2011-04-20T20:31:59  <antimatroid> and university is meant to get you started with learning, the good students do a lot of learning outside those classes
2011-04-20T20:32:01  <bhasker> unless you are at one of the top universities
2011-04-20T20:32:19  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: ahahaha :P
2011-04-20T20:32:19  <bhasker> fyi : i am horrible at math :-\
2011-04-20T20:32:26  <jmcarthur> to me, the main problems with universities is that people go hoping to make more money
2011-04-20T20:32:32  <jaycobcoleman> jmcarther: what do you do?
2011-04-20T20:32:39  <bhasker> since my 11th grade i spent so much time programming that my math and physics suffered terribly
2011-04-20T20:32:50  <antimatroid> i don't know any physics
2011-04-20T20:32:57  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: What's so funny, huh?
2011-04-20T20:32:58  <antimatroid> well, barely any
2011-04-20T20:33:08  <antimatroid> "Meh. Two years of Calculus and AP Physics. I feels like that's good enough for any practical application of math"
2011-04-20T20:33:35  <jmcarthur> jaycobcoleman: i'm between jobs. past job was antitamper and forensics on linux, and my next job is likely to be high frequency trading (have an offer, just haven't accepted yet)
2011-04-20T20:33:52  <jaycobcoleman> My physics education was honestly useless
2011-04-20T20:33:58  <jaycobcoleman> *has been
2011-04-20T20:34:10  <antimatroid> that's because they don't teach physics before uni
2011-04-20T20:34:14  <antimatroid> or anything properly before uni
2011-04-20T20:34:25  <antimatroid> not like physics/maths
2011-04-20T20:34:54  <jmcarthur> i learned a lot of physics in K-12
2011-04-20T20:34:55  <antimatroid> pretty much all of applied science for such fields is using maths to model that aspect of the universe
2011-04-20T20:35:34  <jmcarthur> the education system in the area i grew up in was among the top on the country though
2011-04-20T20:35:53  <jmcarthur> whereas the uni i went to... well, it has a decent reputation, but i thought it sucked
2011-04-20T20:36:44  <jaycobcoleman> My calc has been very good, but we did physics without calculus because there weren't enough students that had already taken calculus :/
2011-04-20T20:36:49  <antimatroid> but yeah, i think university is generally a terrible thing for people to attend just to learn how to program
2011-04-20T20:36:53  <antimatroid> there are much better ways
2011-04-20T20:36:56  <Frontier> I just tried in Firefox 3: visualizer with the 120x120 / 500 turns game, zoomed, fog on and "letters on ants" on. I got a frame every 20 seconds or so ^^
2011-04-20T20:37:12  <jaycobcoleman> haha
2011-04-20T20:37:28  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: fyi , maths students continue taking calculus classes for years, it gets a lot harder
2011-04-20T20:37:44  <jaycobcoleman> Oh no I'm aware.
2011-04-20T20:37:51  <jaycobcoleman> Sounds unpleasant
2011-04-20T20:38:04  <antimatroid> depends on how the class is taken
2011-04-20T20:38:05  <jaycobcoleman> although I've always been incredibley good at math
2011-04-20T20:38:11  <antimatroid> if it's taught as a computation class then yes
2011-04-20T20:38:18  <antimatroid> if you actually get some maths then no
2011-04-20T20:38:29  <jaycobcoleman> What do you mean?
2011-04-20T20:38:47  <antimatroid> most maths before university teaches you how to compute the answer to a problem
2011-04-20T20:38:55  <antimatroid> but doesn't really go into detail as to why these methods work
2011-04-20T20:39:08  <jmcarthur> uni level math teached you how to derive those methods, ideally
2011-04-20T20:39:11  <jmcarthur> *teaches
2011-04-20T20:40:06  <jaycobcoleman> oh haha I'm pretty good with understanding why things work because I never study for the tests, so when I come across a problem I have to create a method to solve it
2011-04-20T20:40:08  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i dislike your distinction between math and computation, though. IMO, computation should *be* a math, but nobody teaches it that way at all. our languages are partly to blame, though
2011-04-20T20:40:18  <jaycobcoleman> It's the best way to learn math :)
2011-04-20T20:40:33  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: i consider numerical methods etc. to be math
2011-04-20T20:40:44  <antimatroid> but the actual solving of a problem using one on paper for example?
2011-04-20T20:40:46  <antimatroid> computation
2011-04-20T20:41:05  <antimatroid> finding the derivative of a function, computaiton
2011-04-20T20:41:07  <jmcarthur> oh, you mean the *execution* of a computation
2011-04-20T20:41:12  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-20T20:41:36  <antimatroid> most maths prior to university is doing that, and they don't really explain why the method works
2011-04-20T20:41:41  <jmcarthur> to me, the *description* of a computation is ideally mathematical in nature (beyond just numerical methods)
2011-04-20T20:42:35  <antimatroid> like one doesn't really get given the full picture for why derivatives work until one takes an analysis class (unless one goes to a very top university)
2011-04-20T20:43:35  <jmcarthur> IMO the hand wavy presentation of derivatives as formulas involving infinitesimals would be perfectly fine if they would just give it some rigor
2011-04-20T20:44:34  <antimatroid> most people teaching it probably haven't studied mathematics properly either though
2011-04-20T20:44:49  <antimatroid> properly is probably not the right word
2011-04-20T20:44:52  <antimatroid> but you know what i mean
2011-04-20T20:45:47  <jmcarthur> yeah, i need to keep in mind that most areas don't have awesome K-12 programs. all the physics and mathematics teachers at my high school were phds and also taught at the university level
2011-04-20T20:46:05  <jmcarthur> well, not all of them, but most of them
2011-04-20T20:46:49  <jmcarthur> i wish the K-12 programs didn't all suck
2011-04-20T20:52:33  <antimatroid> yeah same
2011-04-20T20:52:45  <antimatroid> but there just are't the reosources
2011-04-20T20:53:48  <antimatroid> i wish there was a lot more self directed study before uni
2011-04-20T20:53:51  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: if you want asymmetric maps to be slightly more consistent from bot to bot we can adapt the do_food_offset function so that rather than determining a relative location and then placing the food square on the location closest to that offset for each ant, it can look at each ant and find a location that will necessarily be the same distance away
2011-04-20T20:54:17  <antimatroid> i don't like doing that
2011-04-20T20:54:28  <jaycobcoleman> why is that?
2011-04-20T20:54:54  <antimatroid> because it's going too far to try and force fairness with asymmetry

2011-04-20T20:55:03  <antimatroid> it may not be perfectly fair either
2011-04-20T20:55:32  <antimatroid> and once you are all in view, the better ants will pretty much all collect in the same amount of time
2011-04-20T20:55:38  <jaycobcoleman> it should be if you use the acutal travel distance
2011-04-20T20:55:56  <antimatroid> i don
2011-04-20T20:56:05  <antimatroid> i don't see any reason not to use symmetric maps
2011-04-20T20:56:18  <jaycobcoleman> I agree
2011-04-20T20:56:33  <jaycobcoleman> I was under the impression that it was going to happen anyway though
2011-04-20T20:56:48  <antimatroid> it will fail
2011-04-20T20:57:03  <antimatroid> i really doubt many contestants will prefer asymmetric maps
2011-04-20T20:57:45  <antimatroid> particularly those who are interested in seeing an as accurate as possible ranking of their bot relative to other people
2011-04-20T20:58:11  <jaycobcoleman> I concur. Who is ultimately making the decision as to what types of maps to use?
2011-04-20T20:58:42  <antimatroid> not sure anymore, probably janzert/mcleopold and someone ese
2011-04-20T20:58:44  <antimatroid> maybe sigh
2011-04-20T20:59:04  <antimatroid> but they wont just ignore the opinion of others
2011-04-20T20:59:43  <jaycobcoleman> alright, opinions will be voiced. Now I'm gonna disappear for a while so I can play around with the idea of creating a map gen :)

2011-04-20T21:10:12  <antimatroid> zombhasker
2011-04-20T21:10:24  <bhasker> so i will be back probably only after the competition begins
2011-04-20T21:10:53  <bhasker> and work would be backlogged when i get back to work , so i don't know how much time i wil have this time around
2011-04-20T21:11:07  <bhasker> but i shall follow the competition nevertheless
2011-04-20T21:11:57  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm going to be quite busy
2011-04-20T21:12:08  <antimatroid> i suspect i'll end up implementing what i have in mind and just submitting that
2011-04-20T21:14:38  <bhasker> same here probably
2011-04-20T21:14:48  <bhasker> i doubt i will be able to do as many iterations as planetwars
2011-04-20T21:14:54  <bhasker> that was crazy
2011-04-20T21:15:20  <bhasker> though i can't wait to see the really good bots emerge should be fun to watch the games
2011-04-20T21:15:30  <bhasker> is anyone working on porting the tcp server?
2011-04-20T21:15:43  <antimatroid> don;t think so
2011-04-20T21:15:57  <bhasker> hmm it would be a rather boring competition without the tcp server
2011-04-20T21:16:05  <bhasker> tcp server is what made it so much more fun
2011-04-20T21:16:50  <antimatroid> there will be a tcp server
2011-04-20T21:16:54  <antimatroid> that isn't an otpion

2011-04-20T21:35:50  <Frontier> If you compare http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/stable/visualizer.php?game_id=3, you will see the difference when you zoom in and use letters over ants and the fog of war option.

2011-04-20T21:37:02  <Frontier> :) would you mind if I added an option to see the ants as 'real' ants on muddy ground with water that reflects the sky?
2011-04-20T21:37:17  <bhasker> is that the hunter bot playing or one of your own?
2011-04-20T21:37:45  <Frontier> I don't know, I think I got that replay from antimatroid
2011-04-20T21:38:05  <bhasker> oh k
2011-04-20T21:40:59  <bhasker> frontier one thing that would be fun to watch
2011-04-20T21:41:08  <bhasker> would be to maybe highlight contested territtory
2011-04-20T21:41:10  <bhasker> like hotspots
2011-04-20T21:41:16  <Frontier> Btw, some advertising: The visualizer wrapped in Java is available from this location while my laptop is running on Linux: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/stable/visualizer/visualizer.jar
2011-04-20T21:41:19  <bhasker> maybe you could highlight concentrations of dead ants
2011-04-20T21:42:12  <bhasker> though i am not sure if replay has the data
2011-04-20T21:42:15  <bhasker> has that data*
2011-04-20T21:42:20  <Frontier> bhasker: you wouldn't believe how many ideas people have. I would probably need a separate menu for these special options.
2011-04-20T21:42:39  <bhasker> it would be an interesting way to get people to observe the main battles
2011-04-20T21:42:41  <bhasker> in these games
2011-04-20T21:43:00  <bhasker> we should probably update replay format to include dead ants

2011-04-20T21:43:18  <Frontier> no need to. I know when they die.
2011-04-20T21:43:26  <bhasker> ah true i guess you can track it
2011-04-20T21:44:03  <bhasker> the thing with ants is so many battles happen at the same time that its impossible to track most of it
2011-04-20T21:44:04  <Frontier> I'm tracking their locations as well. They are generated from nwse and - chars in a string.
2011-04-20T21:44:10  <bhasker> so someway to highlight would be good
2011-04-20T21:44:42  <bhasker> and some ideas from Supreme commander
2011-04-20T21:44:49  <bhasker> namely allowing range rings around ants
2011-04-20T21:44:59  <bhasker> though that would probably slow down the UI a lot
2011-04-20T21:45:13  <Frontier> that idea isn't even new ;)

2011-04-20T21:45:37  <bhasker> maybe you could enable it in the most zoomed in mode
2011-04-20T21:45:45  <bhasker> so when zoomed in, one could enable range rings
2011-04-20T21:45:51  <bhasker> to observe close battles better
2011-04-20T21:46:02  <bhasker> and also a ring around food
2011-04-20T21:47:28  <Frontier> so the battle radius would be drawn around ants and the spawn radius around food? is that your idea?
2011-04-20T21:48:10  <bhasker> yes
2011-04-20T21:48:42  <bhasker> you could probably enable it by default in zoomed in modes
2011-04-20T21:48:47  <bhasker> and disable it zoomed out modes
2011-04-20T21:48:57  <bhasker> but let the user enable/disable it
2011-04-20T21:49:24  <bhasker> supreme commander has some of the best mini map options :)

2011-04-20T21:49:50  <bhasker> i wish the replay format had the ability to output tracking information to the server
2011-04-20T21:49:53  <bhasker> per turn
2011-04-20T21:50:10  <bhasker> like a bot could give tags to a few positions every turn
2011-04-20T21:50:15  <bhasker> and the visualizer could render these tags
2011-04-20T21:50:25  <bhasker> so it would be a nice visual way to debug
2011-04-20T21:50:28  <Frontier> I missed this in planet wars, too.
2011-04-20T21:50:37  <bhasker> we could limit the number of tags per turn to 1 per bot
2011-04-20T21:50:50  <bhasker> to keep replay formats smal
2011-04-20T21:50:58  <bhasker> so each turn a bot could output a line like
2011-04-20T21:51:05  <bhasker> t X Y <some small string>
2011-04-20T21:51:10  <bhasker> alongwith the orders
2011-04-20T21:51:30  <bhasker> and replay just stores that along
2011-04-20T21:51:38  <bhasker> so visualizer can then render these tags
2011-04-20T21:52:01  <bhasker> would be interesting especially if people want to like make adhoc groups and name/number them
2011-04-20T21:52:12  <Frontier> we have a lot of ants though. imagine 500 tags beeing drawn on screen
2011-04-20T21:52:13  <bhasker> like unit groups in RTS
2011-04-20T21:52:29  <bhasker> well by default it should be disabled
2011-04-20T21:52:39  <bhasker> and the viwere can turn them on per bot
2011-04-20T21:52:44  <bhasker> and its not one tag per ant
2011-04-20T21:52:49  <bhasker> but rather one tag per turn
2011-04-20T21:52:55  <Frontier> ah i see
2011-04-20T21:53:14  <bhasker> or maybe a bot can have 10 tag slots totall
2011-04-20T21:53:20  <bhasker> and each turn update each tag slot
2011-04-20T21:53:24  <bhasker> or the one it wants

2011-04-20T21:54:42  <contestbot> i know...
2011-04-20T21:55:10  <bhasker> will your visualizer break if it gets lines that it can't understand?

2011-04-20T21:56:19  <bhasker> @tell sigh how about an idea of allowing each bot 10 tag slots which can be used to emit text to replays at certain locations
2011-04-20T21:56:20  <contestbot> bhasker: Error: I haven't seen sigh, I'll let you do the telling.

2011-04-20T22:04:09  <bhasker> floating transparent tags
2011-04-20T22:04:37  <bhasker> since its a java applet i am guessing you can draw small floating text which has an alpha transluency
2011-04-20T22:04:42  <bhasker> so it blends with the background
2011-04-20T22:04:55  <bhasker> so you can still see what happening below the tag
2011-04-20T22:09:18  <Frontier> bhasker, sure. but i meant the ui elements to enable or disable the tags per player
2011-04-20T22:09:39  <bhasker> can just be a button per player?
2011-04-20T22:09:54  <bhasker> show tags on/off

2011-04-20T22:10:15  <bhasker> its pretty neat though too many ants going for one food
2011-04-20T22:11:18  <antimatroid> that's not the food collection doing that
2011-04-20T22:11:23  <antimatroid> that's the heuristic afterwards
2011-04-20T22:11:58  <Frontier> bhasker: I should not overload the ui with buttons. It will become confusing when you first see the interface. Look at Google Chrome, which may be an extreme case with its slim interface, but it only displays the important stuff and hides menus for example.
2011-04-20T22:12:01  <antimatroid> it's difficult to send one ant to a region of not recently seen squares
2011-04-20T22:12:15  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-20T22:12:18  <bhasker> well one way to do that
2011-04-20T22:12:19  <antimatroid> Frontier: yeah menus are good
2011-04-20T22:12:22  <bhasker> which my bot is doing
2011-04-20T22:12:25  <bhasker> is to just track to enemy
2011-04-20T22:12:30  <bhasker> in most cases that would be outwards
2011-04-20T22:12:33  <antimatroid> i really like simplicity, google is moving away from it :(
2011-04-20T22:12:41  <bhasker> check my bot playing
2011-04-20T22:12:46  <antimatroid> i can blame sigh for that now
2011-04-20T22:12:48  <antimatroid> he works there

2011-04-20T22:14:45  <bhasker> is it committed?
2011-04-20T22:15:04  <Frontier> not the latest version, let me do some testing on that first.
2011-04-20T22:16:31  <Frontier> once stuff is commited you can run 'ant deploy' in the visualizer directory. That will install all the visualizer files in a target directory including the applet for IE etc.

2011-04-20T22:24:21  <bhasker> heh i just copied the visualizer directory over to my server
2011-04-20T22:24:23  <bhasker> seems to work fine
2011-04-20T22:24:28  <bhasker> didn't use any ant script to install last time
2011-04-20T22:25:00  <Frontier> If you only need copy_paste.html that is fine.
2011-04-20T22:25:12  <bhasker> yea
2011-04-20T22:27:05  <Frontier> oh and it is the only way, too since the deploy script was meant for the contest server which will not provide a copy_paste.html ^^
2011-04-20T22:27:23  <Frontier> (it will be there, but as a .zip download)
2011-04-20T22:27:33  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-20T22:28:42  <Frontier> IE 8 users cannot use copy_paste.html though since it doesn't use the Java applet, but only JavaScript and HTML5, part of which is not supported by IE 8.
2011-04-20T22:31:18  <antimatroid> ie 8 users should go and jump off a cliff
2011-04-20T22:31:57  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-20T22:33:59  <Frontier> and everyone should use c++, i know ;)
2011-04-20T22:35:40  <antimatroid> Frontier: just not java :P
2011-04-20T22:36:15  <antimatroid> i'm reasonable
2011-04-20T22:36:16  <antimatroid> :P
2011-04-20T22:36:17  <Frontier> Java is so flexible, you must love it
2011-04-20T22:36:27  <antimatroid> flexible?
2011-04-20T22:36:42  <antimatroid> can't overload variables/functions or operators?
2011-04-20T22:36:46  <antimatroid> how is that flexible?
2011-04-20T22:36:46  <bhasker> antimatroid are you on mac?
2011-04-20T22:36:53  <antimatroid> nope sorry
2011-04-20T22:37:07  <antimatroid> i'm a student, i can't afford their ridiculous prices
2011-04-20T22:37:27  <Frontier> You see games like Minecraft, database applications, web servers, web applications etc etc written in Java. And you can profile it, debug it, it offers full runtime reflection. It is an amazing language.
2011-04-20T22:37:28  <antimatroid> :P
2011-04-20T22:37:41  <antimatroid> except it's java :P
2011-04-20T22:38:11  <antimatroid> i know my hate of java is irrational, it adds to the fun of it for me :P
2011-04-20T22:38:20  <Frontier> operator overloading doesn't add much. It is a function call after all, that looks like a basic operation,
2011-04-20T22:39:01  <bhasker> hmm i need someones bot to test against:-\
2011-04-20T22:39:01  <Frontier> Just use the right tool for the job, as they say.
2011-04-20T22:39:03  <antimatroid> ahem,
2011-04-20T22:39:04  <antimatroid> Matrix C = add(A, product(C, power(D, 3))); vs
2011-04-20T22:39:04  <antimatroid> Matrix C = A + C * (D^3);
2011-04-20T22:39:09  <bhasker> what version of linux are you on?
2011-04-20T22:39:56  <antimatroid> composing functions with infix notation is a hell of a lot easier
2011-04-20T22:40:03  <antimatroid> or whatever it is
2011-04-20T22:40:55  <Frontier> Matrix C = A.add(C.product(D.power(3))); <- see, the operator stays infix ;)
2011-04-20T22:41:06  <antimatroid> it's still gross
2011-04-20T22:41:59  <antimatroid> i personally could not live without operator overloading
2011-04-20T22:43:14  *** amstan <amstan!~amstan@69.165.158.142> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2011-04-20T22:43:52  <Frontier> but there are not enough operators for all operations. for example i use ^ for the cross product, you use it for power.
2011-04-20T22:48:19  <jbroman> Scala FTW. Any function is an infix operator. (and Haskell to a lesser degree)
2011-04-20T22:48:28  <Frontier> At least I have never seen a language and library that is as clean as Java. Most other languages offer constructs that lead to conflicts: operator overloading, macros, ...
2011-04-20T22:49:39  <Frontier> different ways to do the same thing
2011-04-20T22:50:05  <Frontier> It is enough to discuss the use of tabs vs spaces in a company ^^
2011-04-20T22:51:56  <Frontier> jbroman: How do you write a pythonic "print x" in Scala then?
2011-04-20T22:52:23  <jbroman> What do you mean by "a pythonic 'print x'"?
2011-04-20T22:53:03  <Frontier> print is a function with an argument x, but i cannot imagine how to write that in infix notation

2011-04-20T22:53:51  <jbroman> Scala still has the Java-like syntax.
2011-04-20T22:54:05  <Frontier> so there is always an object involved?
2011-04-20T22:54:09  <jbroman> So you can still call System.out.println("asdf") etc
2011-04-20T22:54:37  <jbroman> or foo(4) if the function is local
2011-04-20T22:54:50  *** delt0r___ <delt0r___!~delt0r@188-22-163-224.adsl.highway.telekom.at> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2011-04-20T22:54:59  <jbroman> To my knowledge, you can't call a one-argument function like "foo x".
2011-04-20T22:55:06  <jbroman> But you can as foo(x)
2011-04-20T22:55:28  <Frontier> Python 3 removed that as well. It is always print(x) from now on.
2011-04-20T22:55:38  <jbroman> But if you have a function bar on object y, you can do either "y bar z" or "y.bar(z)"
2011-04-20T22:56:00  <Frontier> hmm, I guess it is faster to write code without dots and brackets
2011-04-20T22:56:16  <jbroman> It is reasonably nice for DSL-type stuff, and you can invent whatever infix operators you like.
2011-04-20T22:56:43  <Frontier> are you limited to ascii named for functions?
2011-04-20T22:56:54  <jbroman> You want unicode names?
2011-04-20T22:56:55  <jbroman> Lemme check.
2011-04-20T22:58:40  <Frontier> I might want to define ⊕ for some object, or ⊇.
2011-04-20T22:58:40  <jbroman> Yup, seems to work.
2011-04-20T22:58:57  <jbroman> This executed correctly:
2011-04-20T22:58:57  <jbroman> def føü(ß: Int) = ß
2011-04-20T22:59:23  <Frontier> that's cool.
2011-04-20T23:00:13  <Frontier> how is the operator precedence evaluated?
2011-04-20T23:00:40  <Frontier> a foo x * 10 may be difficult without brackets
2011-04-20T23:01:34  <jbroman> by the operator's first character:
2011-04-20T23:01:37  <jbroman> (all letters)
2011-04-20T23:01:37  <jbroman> |
2011-04-20T23:01:37  <jbroman> ^
2011-04-20T23:01:38  <jbroman> &
2011-04-20T23:01:38  <jbroman> < >
2011-04-20T23:01:39  <jbroman> = !
2011-04-20T23:01:39  <jbroman> :
2011-04-20T23:01:39  <jbroman> + -
2011-04-20T23:01:39  <jbroman> * / %
2011-04-20T23:01:39  <jbroman> (all other special characters)
2011-04-20T23:01:55  <jbroman> Though in ambiguous cases, it's probably good style to use parentheses.
2011-04-20T23:02:05  <Frontier> as i imagined, so functions are evaluated last
2011-04-20T23:02:44  <jbroman> You can certainly come up with cases which are completely opaque to the compiler (in which case, write clearer code).
2011-04-20T23:03:21  <jbroman> You can't define your own precedence rules, if that's what you're thinking, but going down that road can be fishy.

2011-04-20T23:54:34  <jmcarthur> actually, i think composing functions with prefix notation is much easier
2011-04-20T23:54:50  <jmcarthur> infix notation just looks more like math that i'm used to, that's all
2011-04-20T23:55:45  <jmcarthur> c = add a . product c . power d
2011-04-20T23:55:56  <jmcarthur> or whatever
2011-04-20T23:56:08  <jmcarthur> that of course assumes the 3 is a parameter, i guess
2011-04-20T23:56:17  <jmcarthur> c = add a . product c $ power d 3
2011-04-20T23:56:52  <jmcarthur> actually, for the prefix version i think it makes more sense for the 3 (which i'm assuming means "cubed") to be the first parameter
2011-04-20T23:57:11  <jmcarthur> c = add a . product b . power 3
2011-04-20T23:57:31  <jmcarthur> so then you just apply c to an argument :)
