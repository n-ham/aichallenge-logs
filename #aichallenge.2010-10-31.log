2010-10-31T00:02:03  <eburnette_> I have 59 versions of my bot saved that I can use for test games, and often older ones beat newer ones
2010-10-31T00:02:37  <demerzel_> jesus
2010-10-31T00:02:44  <demerzel_> i guess i should start branching
2010-10-31T00:04:16  <demerzel_> i am just now realizing how much i bit off with this implementation lol

2010-10-31T00:08:10  <eburnette_> I just copy and rename my main program so I can keep all the versions runnable

2010-10-31T00:36:44  <amstan> i just did this: http://cubicmatter.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=54&p=442#p442
2010-10-31T00:39:54  <janzert> btw, golang is working on the servers. just waiting for a working starter package from lavalamp before announcing it
2010-10-31T00:40:23  <amstan> double rainbow..
2010-10-31T00:40:28  <janzert> Although I may just announce it with starter package to follow
2010-10-31T00:40:29  <j3camero> antimatroid1: oh wow sunrise. Yikes what have I done?
2010-10-31T00:42:55  <j3camero> janzert: you are my hero!
2010-10-31T00:43:06  <j3camero> janzert: we had lots of good entries in Go during the Tron contest
2010-10-31T00:43:15  <janzert> great
2010-10-31T00:43:27  <j3camero> janzert: and its very appropriate to have Go since it's Google-sponsored!
2010-10-31T00:43:29  <janzert> lavalamp_: did most of the footwork actually
2010-10-31T00:43:45  <j3camero> amstan: what is that link you posted? Looks likke 3D modeling?
2010-10-31T00:44:11  <j3camero> janzert: oh nice. That's great that you're roping in more volunteers!
2010-10-31T00:44:14  <amstan> j3camero: it's a game server, and you can edit multiplayer, i just added a way to procedurally generate maps
2010-10-31T00:44:25  <j3camero> amstan: sick.
2010-10-31T00:44:41  <j3camero> janzert: what's the status of C# right now?
2010-10-31T00:44:55  <janzert> working through a work around :P
2010-10-31T00:45:12  <janzert> still leaking semaphores like crazy but there are now scripts on the servers to clean up after it
2010-10-31T00:45:33  <janzert> that took me 5 days or something to sort out :(
2010-10-31T00:46:07  <janzert> I just added a script yesterday to monitor ec2 instances and reboot them

2010-10-31T00:46:22  <janzert> you'll want to run it locally somewhere you trust putting your ec2 credentials
2010-10-31T00:46:49  <j3camero> janzert: oh that's awesome! we should get that set up asap. I am free basically all day tomorrow. You down?
2010-10-31T00:47:03  <janzert> It's at /trunk/planet_wars/backend/ec2-check.py but with no isntructions currently
2010-10-31T00:47:19  <janzert> yeah, I won't be around till the afternoon for a few hours
2010-10-31T00:47:30  <janzert> then after around 8pm anytime
2010-10-31T00:47:35  <j3camero> Sweeeet I see we have around 37 games/minute average right now! That's probably doing a lot to reduce user frustration, eh amstan?
2010-10-31T00:47:36  <demerzel_> too bad all your dev is in python i have too much free time ;)

2010-10-31T00:47:58  <janzert> yep
2010-10-31T00:48:02  <janzert> Michigan
2010-10-31T00:48:07  <eburnette_> Nice game: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=787507
2010-10-31T00:48:27  <amstan> janzert: it's variable though
2010-10-31T00:48:40  <amstan> j3camero: it's variable though
2010-10-31T00:49:14  <janzert> I was without power for about 48 hours so I my instances went down during that time :/
2010-10-31T00:49:34  <demerzel_> eburnette: v nice
2010-10-31T00:50:38  <eburnette_> ooh look at this one, go to the last frame and try to guess who won http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=786559
2010-10-31T00:51:09  <j3camero> janzert: so are those your own servers running games right now?
2010-10-31T00:51:29  <janzert> yes, the others went down at the beginning of the week
2010-10-31T00:51:49  <j3camero> I can try to kick them again now but I noticed they're just not working anymore.
2010-10-31T00:51:51  <janzert> they tend to need a hard reboot through ec2 every 12 hours or so
2010-10-31T00:52:10  <janzert> your's will really need to start up fresh so they pull down the latest svn code
2010-10-31T00:53:20  <j3camero> oh right right.
2010-10-31T00:53:36  <j3camero> So I'll have to completely decommission them and create new spot instances you think?
2010-10-31T00:53:41  <j3camero> I am not so familiar with EC2.
2010-10-31T00:53:54  <j3camero> rebooting the EC2 instances....
2010-10-31T00:53:56  <janzert> I think if you just terminate them
2010-10-31T00:54:04  <janzert> ec2 will start fresh instances
2010-10-31T00:54:12  <j3camero> I see I see...
2010-10-31T00:54:33  <j3camero> I'll try that if they dont start playing games in the next 10 minutes.
2010-10-31T00:55:06  <janzert> the problem is that even if they play games they won't have the c# updates and the golang installation
2010-10-31T00:55:43  <janzert> I need to sort out a better way to automatically update them
2010-10-31T00:56:00  <janzert> the easiest might be to just add it to the ec2-check script
2010-10-31T00:56:55  <janzert> hopefully I can get away from fighting instances soon, I really want to work on the match pairing and some other stuff
2010-10-31T00:57:26  <McLeopold> janzert: I have an idea for match pairing
2010-10-31T00:57:37  <janzert> yes?
2010-10-31T00:57:54  <McLeopold> would it help save time if you took a pool of 5-10 bots and did a round robin?
2010-10-31T00:58:01  <janzert> not really
2010-10-31T00:58:20  <McLeopold> I though that might make cleaning up a less frequent operation
2010-10-31T00:58:59  <janzert> nah, there isn't much spent in clean up time or really even setup time after a worker has been up for an hour or two
2010-10-31T00:59:26  <McLeopold> isn't the cleanup, or lack of, what is bringing down the servers?
2010-10-31T00:59:49  <janzert> no
2010-10-31T01:00:00  <janzert> at this point it's bugs in hardy on ec2
2010-10-31T01:00:17  <janzert> where the machines randomly freeze up
2010-10-31T01:00:40  <McLeopold> ah
2010-10-31T01:00:46  <janzert> one problem with the current matchup code is it starts from scratch for every pairing request
2010-10-31T01:01:28  <janzert> the process of making the matchups needs to be separated from the code that hands them out so it can prepare them in batches with much less database load
2010-10-31T01:01:32  <McLeopold> you mean recomputing who's next instead of using a queue?
2010-10-31T01:01:38  <janzert> right
2010-10-31T01:02:09  <janzert> when we had 5 workers running at one point it was overloading the server just handing out and processing the results of matchups
2010-10-31T01:02:41  *** iris1 <iris1!~iris1@cpe-69-203-16-175.nyc.res.rr.com> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection timed out)
2010-10-31T01:02:52  <McLeopold> that seems odd, you mean just the code to give out 2 user ids?
2010-10-31T01:02:55  <janzert> also by splitting it up we can easily do a little more intelligent things such as pairing new submissions with someone near their old rank
2010-10-31T01:03:17  <janzert> because of all the database queries mostly
2010-10-31T01:03:58  <j3camero> that would be great
2010-10-31T01:04:05  <j3camero> then people's rankings would converge way faster
2010-10-31T01:04:12  <antimatroid1> have any of you guys tried having your bot and it's opponent repeatedly make best responses to each others moves and just hoped that went to something decent?
2010-10-31T01:04:24  <antimatroid1> i tried to hack it together last night, but i don't think i did a very good job of it
2010-10-31T01:05:55  <McLeopold> janzert: what file does the matchmaking?
2010-10-31T01:06:02  <j3camero> antimatroid: are you talking about some sort of iterative algorithm?
2010-10-31T01:06:18  <janzert> also am going to poke the mathematician who worked on the tron bot with me to try and optimize the pairings to stabilize and improve the ranking as quickly as possible
2010-10-31T01:06:41  <janzert> http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/source/browse/trunk/planet_wars/www/api_get_matchup.php
2010-10-31T01:06:48  <janzert> is the one that hands out to workers
2010-10-31T01:07:54  <janzert> the other problem with the current method is that one player keeps getting chosen for the first player until a game result is recorded which means people tend to get 2 or 3 games right in a row
2010-10-31T01:08:12  <j3camero> janzert i can tell you're doing a lot of great work here. You should focus on what you're interested in. If you would rather work on the mathcing policy than the server troubles maybe just do that.
2010-10-31T01:08:43  <janzert> well, I think we have to have servers up though or people aren't going to bother staying around
2010-10-31T01:09:00  <janzert> but I think I'm really close to those staying up fairly consistently now
2010-10-31T01:09:07  <janzert> so I will be able to move on
2010-10-31T01:09:52  <j3camero> nice nice thats good to know
2010-10-31T01:10:04  <eburnette_> How's it going to work when submissions close - reset scores and go until... what?
2010-10-31T01:10:21  <j3camero> I know I am always glad to be done with puttign out fires so I can work on the cooler algorithmic aspects.
2010-10-31T01:10:36  <janzert> eburnette: until we run out of time most likely :P
2010-10-31T01:10:52  <janzert> j3camero: yep, will feel good :)
2010-10-31T01:11:00  <McLeopold> dang, nodejs is out?
2010-10-31T01:11:01  <j3camero> eburnette_: dunno we'll just wing it like last time. probably wipe the slate clean, create some new maps, and run people's bots until the rankigns more or less converge.
2010-10-31T01:12:05  <eburnette_> how do you tell if map creation is fair? bots tend to have favorite maps
2010-10-31T01:12:07  <janzert> McLeopold: if you're looking at what I think you are it's in just only running on the main server right now
2010-10-31T01:12:31  <j3camero> eburnette_: haven't thought much about it. what do you think?
2010-10-31T01:12:51  <contestbot> Top 10 players: GreenTea(4187), bocsimacko(4186), felixcoto(4153), Slin-.-(4137), Accoun(4117), dmj111(4102), rsergio(4067), joakim_mjardner(4065), protocolocon(4030), Hazard(4027)
2010-10-31T01:12:53  <j3camero> k going to bed. I'll be around tomorrow during the afternoon.
2010-10-31T01:13:01  <janzert> see you then
2010-10-31T01:13:47  <eburnette_> how about creating a brand new map for each match, using map gen program that is known a couple weeks in advance?
2010-10-31T01:14:21  <McLeopold> janzert: if you get around to it, a nicer map choosing algo would be nice to
2010-10-31T01:14:36  <janzert> McLeopold: yep, I've thought about that as well
2010-10-31T01:14:53  <McLeopold> bots are very fickle about the map type
2010-10-31T01:15:06  <janzert> should avoid repeated matches on the same map if at all possible
2010-10-31T01:15:35  <eburnette_> that way you wouldn't get caught with an accidental set of maps that favors one bot
2010-10-31T01:15:55  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-10-31T01:15:56  <janzert> I think the best guard against that is just a rather large pool
2010-10-31T01:16:14  <McLeopold> janzert: a large pool of maps
2010-10-31T01:16:20  <janzert> right
2010-10-31T01:16:22  <eburnette_> large pool might work too, say 10k or more
2010-10-31T01:16:26  <antimatroid1> j3camero: yep
2010-10-31T01:16:28  <demerzel_> somebody help me look at this real quick before my eyes cross thinking too hard about turns
2010-10-31T01:16:35  <antimatroid1> i've tried a whole bunch of things and nothing seems to wor
2010-10-31T01:16:41  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=787923 invalid order was sending 9 from 16 - the one with 10 on it at the end
2010-10-31T01:16:44  <antimatroid1> i thinks it's my move selection though, it needs a lot more though
2010-10-31T01:16:44  <antimatroid1> t
2010-10-31T01:17:01  <antimatroid1> the details of the game are a lot more complicated than i originally thought
2010-10-31T01:17:13  <antimatroid1> the way we're doing neutral conflict resolution complicates things A LOT
2010-10-31T01:17:19  <demerzel_> i spent hours and hours debugging bot turn vs game turn
2010-10-31T01:17:28  <demerzel_> i get easily confused lol
2010-10-31T01:17:46  <demerzel_> imo there's nothing wrong with sending 9 from 16 because there's 10 there
2010-10-31T01:17:48  <antimatroid1> but then, i'm sure any of the alternative resolution methods would have made it any beter
2010-10-31T01:18:12  <antimatroid1> not sure**

2010-10-31T01:18:49  <demerzel_> what i did to the bottom planet
2010-10-31T01:18:55  <demerzel_> grabbed the neutral right after he conq'd it for me
2010-10-31T01:18:59  <McLeopold> demerzel_: kinda, but you wasted 7 just before the snipe
2010-10-31T01:19:00  <antimatroid1> isn't that just attacking?
2010-10-31T01:19:22  <demerzel_> McLeopold: enemy fleet calc - can you tell me why 16 17 9 would be my invalid order?
2010-10-31T01:19:28  <janzert> bah, yep. 5 workers and the main server is up to a load average of 8
2010-10-31T01:19:38  <janzert> drop one and it's now dropping back down
2010-10-31T01:19:51  <McLeopold> demerzel_: because you did it twice? on turn 15, not 16?
2010-10-31T01:20:05  <demerzel_> no i only did it once
2010-10-31T01:20:11  <demerzel_> i have it stderr all moves
2010-10-31T01:20:13  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: it's attacking at the right time
2010-10-31T01:20:32  <demerzel_> McLeopold: your'e right about wasting 7 ships actually - i'm trying to coordinate launches obv it's not working right
2010-10-31T01:20:45  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: no it's not :P and my offensive moves get done as soon as possible, so it just does that
2010-10-31T01:21:00  <antimatroid1> demerel_: you need to not take a neutral the same time as the enemy unless you
2010-10-31T01:21:04  <antimatroid1> re intending to send more than them
2010-10-31T01:21:07  <demerzel_> no i know
2010-10-31T01:21:09  <demerzel_> it's a bug for sure
2010-10-31T01:21:21  <demerzel_> i'm still tyring to figure out why that was invalid
2010-10-31T01:21:30  <demerzel_> got the bot paused with all vars in front of me
2010-10-31T01:21:42  <antimatroid1> also, if you are taking a neutral, it has to be not the future state+1 but the future state + 1 + incoming fleets from them (if your future state has already subtracted that)
2010-10-31T01:21:47  <antimatroid1> i didn't realise that till a few days agoo
2010-10-31T01:21:51  <demerzel_> yup
2010-10-31T01:21:53  <eburnette_> demerzel_ maybe the error message is wrong
2010-10-31T01:22:13  <demerzel_> i just calc what's left over + 1
2010-10-31T01:22:19  <demerzel_> my stderr?
2010-10-31T01:22:27  <McLeopold> more correctly max(future_state+1, incoming_fleets+1)
2010-10-31T01:22:29  <demerzel_> i'm sure it's invalid tcp has been good that way i just don't know what i did wrong
2010-10-31T01:22:41  <eburnette_> whoever says 16 17 9 is invalid
2010-10-31T01:22:43  <demerzel_> or if you just run game turns like i do ships[turn] + 1 ;)
2010-10-31T01:22:54  <demerzel_> that's the last move i made before it kicked me for invalid
2010-10-31T01:23:05  <McLeopold> are you sure you didn't send on turn 15? when it had 8?
2010-10-31T01:23:11  <demerzel_> that's what i'm wondering
2010-10-31T01:23:18  <demerzel_> if tcp stops at 16 what does that mean tho
2010-10-31T01:23:25  <demerzel_> that i gave invalid on 15 or 16
2010-10-31T01:23:58  <antimatroid1> i like that sometimes it's best to send everything at a planet at equal distance
2010-10-31T01:23:59  <McLeopold> i think 15
2010-10-31T01:24:13  <McLeopold> turn 15 does not have any moves from you
2010-10-31T01:24:13  <demerzel_> ugh i hate gameturn vs bot turn bugs
2010-10-31T01:24:15  <antimatroid1> i haven't got that in my bot yet though
2010-10-31T01:24:15  <demerzel_> so hard to track down
2010-10-31T01:24:31  <McLeopold> demerzel_, just start counting at 1
2010-10-31T01:24:32  <demerzel_> McLeopold: ok ty
2010-10-31T01:25:01  <demerzel_> bot turn = game turn but pre-resolution
2010-10-31T01:25:07  <demerzel_> in my implementations anyway
2010-10-31T01:25:13  <demerzel_> i do actually run turn logic etc so i have to track it
2010-10-31T01:25:32  <virdo> what's the difference between game turn and bot turn? aren't they the same?
2010-10-31T01:25:40  <demerzel_> hehehe
2010-10-31T01:25:41  <demerzel_> no
2010-10-31T01:25:49  <McLeopold> I spent a day reviewing the turn orders.
2010-10-31T01:25:52  <eburnette_> check all your commands since the last go, any of them could be wrong
2010-10-31T01:26:05  <demerzel_> i am only allowing it 1 per turn atm
2010-10-31T01:26:19  <demerzel_> virdo: on turn 1 you will have 105 ships
2010-10-31T01:26:27  <McLeopold> get game state at check my state, inc turn num, give orders, perform battles, repeat
2010-10-31T01:26:28  <demerzel_> virdo: but you can't use them, you're stuck pre-resolution
2010-10-31T01:26:50  <demerzel_> so i just implement botturn concept, which is game turn, but prior to growth/fights
2010-10-31T01:26:56  <virdo> how do you have 105 ships on turn 1? you start with 100 ships.
2010-10-31T01:26:57  <eburnette_> I put in assertions in my issue_order function, to verify the moves were valid before issuing them just in case - found a buncha bugs
2010-10-31T01:27:02  <McLeopold> technically there is no game/bot turn number
2010-10-31T01:27:21  <McLeopold> you get a game state followed by a go, then you send orders followed by a go
2010-10-31T01:27:32  <demerzel_> virdo: it does growth and battles AFTER your orders, but the results can't be used until next turn
2010-10-31T01:27:43  <demerzel_> virdo: as in you will have 105 ships at the end of the turn but you can't use them till next turn
2010-10-31T01:28:05  <demerzel_> if you have state prediction like most of the bots do you know you will have 105 ships at the end of turn 1 but you can't look at it like that you have to say it will be turn 2
2010-10-31T01:28:14  <McLeopold> demerzel_: it's splitting hairs, but I would say you have 105 ships at the start of you turn
2010-10-31T01:28:21  <McLeopold> next turn
2010-10-31T01:28:24  <demerzel_> yes
2010-10-31T01:28:29  <demerzel_> that's the best way to implement it i would say
2010-10-31T01:28:29  <virdo> agreed here, that's turn 2 :)
2010-10-31T01:28:41  <demerzel_> but then you have to adjust fleet etas
2010-10-31T01:28:44  <eburnette_> you can't start by sending a fleet of 105
2010-10-31T01:28:52  <demerzel_> for example
2010-10-31T01:29:01  <demerzel_> turn 1 you launch to a 50 ship planet with an eta of 5
2010-10-31T01:29:08  <McLeopold> you just have to remember that stuff happens between your go and the next game state
2010-10-31T01:29:12  <demerzel_> on turn 6 you will have 1 ship on that planet but you can't use it till turn 7
2010-10-31T01:29:27  <McLeopold> demerzel_: you can use the 1 right away
2010-10-31T01:29:27  <demerzel_> it's either adjust the etas or adjust all ship calcs back a turn
2010-10-31T01:29:36  <demerzel_> no not exaclty
2010-10-31T01:29:40  <demerzel_> the eta is what turn it will arrive
2010-10-31T01:29:43  <demerzel_> which is after you give orders
2010-10-31T01:29:49  <McLeopold> hope
2010-10-31T01:29:51  <demerzel_> if it's eta is turn 6 and you try to use it on turn 6 you will invalide
2010-10-31T01:29:55  <McLeopold> i mean, nope
2010-10-31T01:29:59  <demerzel_> you can't use it till turn 7
2010-10-31T01:30:12  <virdo> demerzel_: I think you're doing your turns in some whacky way :)
2010-10-31T01:30:20  <McLeopold> you can use it at turn 6
2010-10-31T01:30:22  <demerzel_> virdo: could be ;)
2010-10-31T01:31:18  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: I'ma make some interesting maps with small planets and actually type them up, are you keen for some? and I would be interested in other people coming up with some too
2010-10-31T01:31:30  <McLeopold> sure
2010-10-31T01:31:52  <McLeopold> demerzel_: I hope you caught that you can use ships as soon as they arrive.

2010-10-31T01:32:49  <demerzel_> McLeopold: i'm probably just not explaining it right - i have predicted all 200 turns accurately for almost a month
2010-10-31T01:33:03  <demerzel_> i'm just recoding it and forgot my standards and overthinking it

2010-10-31T01:35:13  <McLeopold> okay, but if distance is 5, send at turn 1, arrive at turn 6, send 1 at turn 6
2010-10-31T01:35:42  <demerzel_> ah holy shit i skipped a turn somewhere lol
2010-10-31T01:35:48  <demerzel_> that's interesting
2010-10-31T01:35:53  <demerzel_> probably didn't get a reply from tcp fast enough
2010-10-31T01:35:53  <McLeopold> that logic doesn't prevent you from predicting game state, just holding on to fleets an extra turn
2010-10-31T01:36:15  <demerzel_> well you would logically deduct 1 from your eta
2010-10-31T01:36:21  <demerzel_> since it's moving this turn
2010-10-31T01:36:30  <demerzel_> you just don't do that i guess
2010-10-31T01:36:58  <demerzel_> wow this is going to be fun to track down
2010-10-31T01:37:05  <McLeopold> you would logically deduct 1 from distance between turns 1 and 2
2010-10-31T01:37:21  <McLeopold> so that the first time the opponent sees the fleet it would have eta 4
2010-10-31T01:38:04  <McLeopold> orders, advance/growth, battle, repeat

2010-10-31T01:38:50  <McLeopold> there's my small map
2010-10-31T01:40:29  <McLeopold> where's that site where you can paste game results?
2010-10-31T01:41:04  <coofamani> is there a URL for viewing all of your game results?
2010-10-31T01:41:40  <virdo> there are two -- http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/visualizer/ and pastebin like here: http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/
2010-10-31T01:41:52  <virdo> coofamani: like the rankings page?
2010-10-31T01:42:13  <coofamani> virdo: no, a history of games for your profile

2010-10-31T01:42:28  <virdo> contestbot: click on "My Profile" on the website.

2010-10-31T01:43:16  <McLeopold> I just read the part of the website where it tells me. :)
2010-10-31T01:45:40  <McLeopold> demerzel_: http://visualizer.naktibalda.lt/506
2010-10-31T01:45:53  <McLeopold> demerzel_: just to make sure we are on the same page
2010-10-31T01:46:27  <McLeopold> demerzel_: notice how the 70 fleet avoids the 105 fleet?
2010-10-31T01:47:22  <demerzel_> yes
2010-10-31T01:47:43  <demerzel_> my bot has got multi launch down at least
2010-10-31T01:47:43  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=788111
2010-10-31T01:48:02  <demerzel_> it's beautiful!  watch from 13 on
2010-10-31T01:48:06  <virdo> negative growth planet? wonder how different engines handle that ;) (negative ship counts?)
2010-10-31T01:48:22  <demerzel_> got 3 separate launches to the neutral on the left :)
2010-10-31T01:48:32  <demerzel_> now to figure out why i tried to launch more than i had lol
2010-10-31T01:48:57  <McLeopold> bot 13 or game 13 :P
2010-10-31T01:49:03  <demerzel_> turn 13 on the one i linked
2010-10-31T01:49:25  <demerzel_> still got a 1-off problem tho
2010-10-31T01:49:36  <demerzel_> 2 fleeets land at the same time but the last one is one behind
2010-10-31T01:50:40  *** coofamani <coofamani!~coofamani@98-129-220-184.slicehost.net> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2010-10-31T01:53:08  <virdo> hehe, my bot does so much multi launch I'm trying to stop it ;) -- if it doesn't use the fleet for defence, it always sends it out, either routes it, or attacks neutrals / enemy... have to make it delay attacks / coordinate more
2010-10-31T01:55:45  <demerzel_> i haven't put in defense yet lol - it's mostly just automatic in that it sees a gain in defending atm
2010-10-31T01:57:44  <virdo> well, mine in brain dead too then... if I see it I lose it in the future, I check if I can get to it in time to defend it, and I just send towards it the amount needed.
2010-10-31T01:58:02  <demerzel_> if i could get this damn invalid order bug tracked down argh
2010-10-31T01:58:52  <McLeopold> demerzel_: you got some games with 4-5 turns and only 1 planet.  It should be easy to track down from them.
2010-10-31T01:59:01  <McLeopold> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=787763
2010-10-31T01:59:08  <virdo> you log for yourself the state of the game / fleet orders? so you log sending X amount of ships from planet Y that has Z ships available still? :)
2010-10-31T01:59:59  <McLeopold> are you sending 0 size fleets?
2010-10-31T02:00:05  <McLeopold> are you sending to the same planet?
2010-10-31T02:00:14  <demerzel_> no i know what orders i'm sending
2010-10-31T02:00:15  <McLeopold> are you sending from a planet you don't own?
2010-10-31T02:00:25  <demerzel_> nope just sending more than i have in 2 different missions
2010-10-31T02:00:35  <McLeopold> ah
2010-10-31T02:00:37  <demerzel_> stupid thing is both planet state and supply state both know i don't have that much
2010-10-31T02:00:42  <demerzel_> so it's difficult to figure out where it's not catching it
2010-10-31T02:01:45  <virdo> in my bot, sometimes I started adding min(planet.ships_available, ships_i_want_to_send)
2010-10-31T02:01:52  <virdo> is it only happening when you send 2 fleets from the same planet?
2010-10-31T02:03:07  <demerzel_> it's sending fleets too early basically
2010-10-31T02:03:36  <demerzel_> i'll find it ;)  it knows the turn it's supposed to get there and it knows how much it really has
2010-10-31T02:03:40  <demerzel_> but for whatever reason it's sending off anyway
2010-10-31T02:05:01  <demerzel_> guess i just need to dump it all too much for stderr
2010-10-31T02:07:04  <virdo> dump it into a file
2010-10-31T02:07:36  <virdo> update visualize_localy.py and integrate it with the visualizer.js ;)
2010-10-31T02:08:06  <virdo> at least that's the best method I've found so far
2010-10-31T02:08:16  <virdo> but definitely interested in ways everyone else debugs their bots
2010-10-31T02:12:17  <demerzel_> i used to dump all info but now i am thinking i have an ide just dump game state and then recreate and step throug

2010-10-31T02:13:31  <antimatroid1> there's 4 maps to start with
2010-10-31T02:13:36  <McLeopold> an ide just to review my logs files
2010-10-31T02:13:38  <antimatroid1> they're not very hard to work out
2010-10-31T02:13:44  <antimatroid1> i don't think
2010-10-31T02:13:54  <antimatroid1> now i'ma move to 2d
2010-10-31T02:13:55  <demerzel_> well you might as ewll use the ide
2010-10-31T02:14:04  <demerzel_> lot more work to make a bunch of customized data dumps
2010-10-31T02:16:59  <virdo> my current setup: http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/debug.png ... the debug info on the right side is per turn... how do you guys do it? I may want to copy your methods ;)
2010-10-31T02:17:53  <antimatroid1> let me know what you guys think are the best moves on each of those maps if you can be bothered
2010-10-31T02:18:38  <antimatroid1> mcleopold will probably find i got numbers wrong again, i think i got it right though
2010-10-31T02:20:09  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: the second one should be attack the center
2010-10-31T02:20:13  <McLeopold> the first, wait
2010-10-31T02:20:44  <McLeopold> the 3rd and 4th, wait
2010-10-31T02:21:27  <antimatroid1> i think you should do your neutral on the third, hang on i'll check again
2010-10-31T02:22:18  <antimatroid1> yeah, pretty sure you can defend your claim of your neutral in 3
2010-10-31T02:22:26  <McLeopold> yes, your right
2010-10-31T02:22:42  <McLeopold> if opponent lanches far first turn, you can hop and gain 5
2010-10-31T02:22:53  <antimatroid1> doesn't even matter
2010-10-31T02:22:56  <antimatroid1> you can back it up
2010-10-31T02:23:09  <McLeopold> if you into that...
2010-10-31T02:23:26  <antimatroid1> i'm not sure hoping is better for you
2010-10-31T02:23:47  <antimatroid1> cause you incure the 10 cost to take the neutral
2010-10-31T02:23:54  <antimatroid1> and you already lost it on your neutral
2010-10-31T02:24:46  <McLeopold> okay, down 10, up 5
2010-10-31T02:25:24  <antimatroid1> i think best strategy is to take your neutral first move with 11, then send back up second move if they attacked
2010-10-31T02:26:03  <McLeopold> well, since there is nothing interesting by your starting planet, you might as well send it forward
2010-10-31T02:26:10  <McLeopold> The full 100
2010-10-31T02:26:17  <McLeopold> and stream the rest
2010-10-31T02:26:23  <antimatroid1> yes, but assuming there were other choices, and this was a subgame
2010-10-31T02:27:05  <McLeopold> only if those other choices are better than the 2 center planets combined
2010-10-31T02:27:08  <antimatroid1> i'm trying to work out specific details of the game better, i'm convinced that's why my bot sucks
2010-10-31T02:27:29  <McLeopold> these types of maps are excatly what i've been working on for a month
2010-10-31T02:27:39  <antimatroid1> but they might expand to other places later, enabling you to spend the other 89 ships expanding elsewhere too
2010-10-31T02:27:54  <antimatroid1> so you don't want to send everything right away
2010-10-31T02:28:02  <antimatroid1> only what you HAVE to
2010-10-31T02:28:04  *** Rubicon-|-Cross <Rubicon-|-Cross!~RubiconCr@adsl-99-30-224-80.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-31T02:28:35  <McLeopold> even if it is a sub-game, you still want to neutralize the enemy's ships
2010-10-31T02:29:15  <antimatroid1> yeah, but there might be something you can expand to with 15 ships near your home planet, you can't take that now, but if they send that much out to somewhere nowhere near the centre first turn, then you can expand with it
2010-10-31T02:29:20  <antimatroid1> if that makes sense
2010-10-31T02:30:55  <McLeopold> it does, but it depends on where the front line is
2010-10-31T02:31:11  <McLeopold> not moving to the center is like retreating
2010-10-31T02:31:38  <McLeopold> what's behind you has too be worth 21 growth or more, and the enemy has to have nothing behind them
2010-10-31T02:35:32  <antimatroid1> i think the information advantage might be better, remember you only lose one turn
2010-10-31T02:37:20  <McLeopold> the closer planet is even, the furthur is 2, due to reaction time
2010-10-31T02:37:34  <McLeopold> you only control 1 planet at the start
2010-10-31T02:37:53  <McLeopold> if you can move to the close neutral, and your opponent doesn't, you control 2

2010-10-31T03:37:42  <demerzel_> isn't that like high end ai shit nowadays lol
2010-10-31T03:37:51  <demerzel_> is there a go competition after this or something
2010-10-31T03:40:47  <lavalamp_> no I play go competitively
2010-10-31T03:41:04  <antimatroid1> where do people find these ai things for go?
2010-10-31T03:41:13  <antimatroid1> i'd be keen to have a play
2010-10-31T03:41:16  <lavalamp_> language or game?
2010-10-31T03:41:24  <antimatroid1> game
2010-10-31T03:42:39  <lavalamp_> I don't know if there is a contest running for a go ai or not
2010-10-31T03:43:02  <lavalamp_> at some points there has been prize money available for making bots of a certain level
2010-10-31T03:43:19  <antimatroid1> surely there's a place people writing bots test against each other
2010-10-31T03:43:47  <lavalamp_> oh, yeah, there's the equivilent of the tcp server
2010-10-31T03:44:14  <lavalamp_> there's also a script so you can hook up a go bot to the KGS go server (gokgs.com)
2010-10-31T03:45:15  <antimatroid1> where would one find the equivalent of the tcp server is my question? :P
2010-10-31T03:45:42  <lavalamp_> janzert didn't say if golang was enabled or not, I just uploaded a submission to find out...
2010-10-31T03:46:05  <lavalamp_> http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/go/ladder.html
2010-10-31T03:47:05  <antimatroid1> cheers
2010-10-31T03:51:26  <lavalamp_> grr it says there were errors compiling but it's not emailing me
2010-10-31T03:51:35  <lavalamp_> at least it identified the language
2010-10-31T03:52:15  <janzert> hmm, lavalamp_ it did work for me earlier
2010-10-31T03:52:28  <janzert> are you sure the emails aren't ending up in your spam folder btw
2010-10-31T03:52:46  <janzert> antimatroid1: cgos is the place to test go bots
2010-10-31T03:52:51  <janzert> http://cgos.boardspace.net/
2010-10-31T03:53:03  <lavalamp_> janzert, yeah not in spam, either
2010-10-31T03:53:10  <janzert> generally people play there bots on the kgs server to get games against humans

2010-10-31T03:54:30  <demerzel_> wow after almost 2 hours of debugging this shit i figured out it wasn't clearing arrays properly because i messed up the size
2010-10-31T03:54:31  <janzert> and computer-go mailing list is the place for discussion http://computer-go.org/mailman/listinfo/computer-go :)
2010-10-31T03:54:37  <demerzel_> downside of c++ i guess lol
2010-10-31T03:54:47  <janzert> lavalamp_: try resubmitting maybe
2010-10-31T03:55:00  <janzert> what is your name on the main server?
2010-10-31T03:55:27  <janzert> or more importantly your user_id
2010-10-31T03:57:09  <lavalamp_> hold on, I just realized I included a couple of files that aren't part of my project and since it doesn't use my makefile it's trying to compile them
2010-10-31T03:57:31  <janzert> ahh, that could do it
2010-10-31T03:57:43  <lavalamp_> yeah ok let's see if this works...
2010-10-31T03:58:06  <sigh> hey, what's all this talk about Go?

2010-10-31T03:58:43  <janzert> yay
2010-10-31T03:58:52  <lavalamp_> you are my favorite person right now
2010-10-31T03:59:09  <demerzel_> yay i have graduated from broken bot to shitty bot
2010-10-31T03:59:13  <janzert> j3camero brought them back up but I'm pretty sure they didn't get updated with go
2010-10-31T03:59:14  <lavalamp_> sigh, I play go and I wrote my bot in the language go
2010-10-31T03:59:27  <sigh> ah nice :)
2010-10-31T03:59:30  <sigh> what's your rank?
2010-10-31T03:59:37  <lavalamp_> 2d AGA
2010-10-31T03:59:45  <sigh> not too bad :)
2010-10-31T04:00:04  <lavalamp_> I just defended it at a tournament to day, wasn't sure if I could or not so I'm happy
2010-10-31T04:00:22  <janzert> nice
2010-10-31T04:00:42  <sigh> yeah, it's always nice when your skills hold up in a tournament
2010-10-31T04:00:54  <sigh> I need to start playing again
2010-10-31T04:00:56  <lavalamp_> wow, how many servers are running? I have two games already!!
2010-10-31T04:01:15  <janzert> don't worry that's a problem with the matchup system right now :P
2010-10-31T04:01:23  <janzert> but there are three
2010-10-31T04:01:35  <lavalamp_> sigh: Yeah, I won the prior tournament I was at and got promoted
2010-10-31T04:01:41  <janzert> 2 of them you will just crash on though
2010-10-31T04:01:58  <sigh> :)
2010-10-31T04:02:13  <lavalamp_> janzert: lol
2010-10-31T04:02:36  <lavalamp_> thanks a bunch for including my script

2010-10-31T04:13:50  <lavalamp_> nothing, go hadn't been enabled on the official servers yet
2010-10-31T04:14:01  <sigh> ah fair enough
2010-10-31T04:14:38  <sigh> in my experience, you got a good draw... a lot of the time your first game is against someone much weaker and the climb takes much longer
2010-10-31T04:15:04  <lavalamp_> what's your bot at?
2010-10-31T04:15:21  <lavalamp_> yeah not bad, they were both 400's
2010-10-31T04:15:42  <sigh> at 35 at the moment: http://www.ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=6041
2010-10-31T04:15:52  <sigh> haven't worked on it for over 2 weeks though
2010-10-31T04:16:36  <raedwulf> my bot better beat mega1 's... with the amountof time i've spent on it lol!
2010-10-31T04:16:40  <raedwulf> no offense mega1 :P
2010-10-31T04:16:52  <raedwulf> hehe, ill be happy with top-100 though
2010-10-31T04:16:52  <antimatroid1> i have spent AGES on mine and it sucks
2010-10-31T04:17:01  <antimatroid1> i'm working on refining my move selection/studying for an exam
2010-10-31T04:17:06  <antimatroid1> i want top 10
2010-10-31T04:17:16  <lavalamp_> sigh, nice
2010-10-31T04:17:24  <raedwulf> :D
2010-10-31T04:17:27  <raedwulf> i have no exams yet
2010-10-31T04:17:31  <lavalamp_> antimatroid1, yeah I'm hoping for that too
2010-10-31T04:17:33  <raedwulf> mine are in january
2010-10-31T04:17:36  <antimatroid1> these are my last exams for undergrad
2010-10-31T04:17:53  <antimatroid1> i should have had it for tron except the stupid timeout rule
2010-10-31T04:17:55  <raedwulf> any idea what the next contest will be?
2010-10-31T04:17:56  <raedwulf> :P
2010-10-31T04:17:56  <lavalamp_> wow my bot played so terribly and still won that second one
2010-10-31T04:18:09  <sigh> :)
2010-10-31T04:18:24  <raedwulf> wait... my bot for this contest doesn't work yet
2010-10-31T04:18:34  <raedwulf> just a lot of code xD
2010-10-31T04:18:44  <antimatroid1> let's hope the games don't get exponentially harder each time
2010-10-31T04:18:49  <raedwulf> haha
2010-10-31T04:18:54  <antimatroid1> i don't even want to know what would be next
2010-10-31T04:19:10  <sigh> Go :P
2010-10-31T04:19:29  <antimatroid1> a continuous game would be cool
2010-10-31T04:19:31  <sigh> that would be sucky for this contest though, too high barrier of entry
2010-10-31T04:19:37  <sigh> antimatroid1, like what?
2010-10-31T04:19:39  <raedwulf> tiddlywinks
2010-10-31T04:19:43  <antimatroid1> some kind of chasing game
2010-10-31T04:19:50  <antimatroid1> 3d fighter pilots seems reasonable
2010-10-31T04:20:16  <raedwulf> and you can watch matches using webgl
2010-10-31T04:20:18  <raedwulf> woot
2010-10-31T04:20:20  <raedwulf> :D
2010-10-31T04:20:23  <antimatroid1> you can set angle of rotation (limited based off of speed), acceleration/deacceleration and can "fire"
2010-10-31T04:20:26  <sigh> sticking to 2d is a bit better I think
2010-10-31T04:20:58  <antimatroid1> i think 2d is too easy to solve
2010-10-31T04:21:09  <antimatroid1> i could be wrong
2010-10-31T04:21:20  <sigh> depends on the actual game, I suppose
2010-10-31T04:21:22  <antimatroid1> that kind of stuff pops up with differential game theory
2010-10-31T04:22:07  <sigh> main reason I suggested 2d is that being able to get up and running quickly is a huge bonus for this competition
2010-10-31T04:22:08  <antimatroid1> or something like 2p mario cart
2010-10-31T04:22:10  <antimatroid1> with weapons
2010-10-31T04:22:16  <sigh> as well as being able to easily write tools
2010-10-31T04:22:31  <antimatroid1> yeah, but one could say planetwars is a lot harder than tron was
2010-10-31T04:22:52  <antimatroid1> i've only just begun to see how retarded my selection of moves is in the last few days
2010-10-31T04:22:56  <lavalamp_> hm where's the server status page?
2010-10-31T04:23:05  <antimatroid1> http://ai-contest.com/game_stats.php
2010-10-31T04:23:07  <sigh> what were you doing wrong?
2010-10-31T04:23:13  <lavalamp_> thx
2010-10-31T04:23:38  <antimatroid1> many things, like if i want to take a neutral, it's not the future state of that planet, it's the future state + the number of incoming fleets from the opponent at that time

2010-10-31T04:23:53  <antimatroid1> and refined times where i would want to take neutrals that aren't strictly closest to me etc.
2010-10-31T04:24:21  <antimatroid1> i had a terrible calculation with me move selection that was possibly sending negative fleets then completely ignoring that move
2010-10-31T04:24:23  <raedwulf> easy to learn, hard to master
2010-10-31T04:24:29  <sigh> ah, that first point is pretty basic... I'm suprised you only just implemented it

2010-10-31T04:24:53  <raedwulf> thats why my bot doesn't work yet
2010-10-31T04:25:02  <raedwulf> i wrote a lot of base code
2010-10-31T04:25:07  <sigh> antimatroid1: I've made a ton of approximations
2010-10-31T04:25:11  <raedwulf> to simplify my writing of heuristics
2010-10-31T04:25:23  <antimatroid1> so did i, it's horrible trying to go back through and refine it all
2010-10-31T04:25:26  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-10-31T04:25:35  <raedwulf> yea i ditched about 500 lines of code
2010-10-31T04:26:01  <raedwulf> it wasn't general enough to write my rules
2010-10-31T04:26:27  <raedwulf> meh i still have to test the code
2010-10-31T04:26:33  <raedwulf> i better do that now i guess...

2010-10-31T06:01:22  <Frontier> raedwulf: don't use j when it looks similar to i ;)   I just jump straight to k.
2010-10-31T06:01:51  <raedwulf> hehe
2010-10-31T06:02:01  <raedwulf> nah i copied and pasted a loop with i and j

2010-10-31T06:26:10  <Error323> i'm at 49 with 237 elo
2010-10-31T06:26:18  <Error323> mmm
2010-10-31T06:26:21  <Error323> true
2010-10-31T06:27:25  <Error323> bhasker: whats ur name @ tcp?
2010-10-31T06:27:31  <bhasker> malazan
2010-10-31T06:27:37  <Error323> ah ok
2010-10-31T06:29:01  <Error323> do you know if staging through hubs is superior to directly going to your destination planet?
2010-10-31T06:29:13  <Error323> I think it might be superior for two reasons
2010-10-31T06:29:36  <Error323> 1) less in-flight time for reactive decisions
2010-10-31T06:29:42  <bhasker> but..
2010-10-31T06:29:48  <bhasker> your flight takes longer to get anywhere
2010-10-31T06:29:52  <bhasker> since you are routing
2010-10-31T06:30:00  <bhasker> so you lose some reaction time there
2010-10-31T06:30:01  <Error323> 2) more difficult for enemies to predict with how much to attack
2010-10-31T06:30:10  <Error323> yes thats the downside
2010-10-31T06:30:12  <bhasker> 2) is a good reason
2010-10-31T06:30:24  <bhasker> i have come up with a strategy where i do 2 things
2010-10-31T06:30:31  <bhasker> if enemy is not close stage to my staging planet
2010-10-31T06:30:37  <Error323> so i think i'm gonna build it in and test @ tcp
2010-10-31T06:30:40  <bhasker> if enemy is close stop sending ships further
2010-10-31T06:30:50  <bhasker> so that way i pile up ships in 3-4 points
2010-10-31T06:30:55  <bhasker> and just launch attack from there
2010-10-31T06:30:57  <bhasker> example
2010-10-31T06:31:46  <bhasker> let me find a good game to show how my bot behaves
2010-10-31T06:32:17  <Error323> cool
2010-10-31T06:32:23  <Error323> you sure you wanna share that info? ;)
2010-10-31T06:32:34  <bhasker> its not a trade secret
2010-10-31T06:32:38  <Error323> ok
2010-10-31T06:32:40  <bhasker> anyone watching my games can see it
2010-10-31T06:32:51  <Error323> :)
2010-10-31T06:32:55  <bhasker> and i have seen other bots doing it to see how i should do it

2010-10-31T06:34:24  <rabidus_> what do you like?
2010-10-31T06:35:05  <bhasker> lol why go for a zero growth planet thats a bug
2010-10-31T06:35:13  <rabidus_> yep :D
2010-10-31T06:35:22  <Error323> are there zero-growth planets?
2010-10-31T06:35:33  <rabidus_> yep, at center
2010-10-31T06:35:35  <bhasker> this is a better map to watch
2010-10-31T06:35:36  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=790432
2010-10-31T06:35:38  <bhasker> yes Error
2010-10-31T06:35:40  <rabidus_> if there is
2010-10-31T06:35:47  <bhasker> you should add logic to ignore it till an enemy takes it
2010-10-31T06:35:59  <bhasker> quite a few maps have  zero growth planets
2010-10-31T06:36:02  <bhasker> with like 100 ships on them
2010-10-31T06:36:10  <bhasker> so for my bot its invisible till enemy takes it
2010-10-31T06:36:14  <bhasker> i don't attack it ever
2010-10-31T06:36:15  <Error323> i see
2010-10-31T06:36:39  <Error323> well my valuefunction should take care of it
2010-10-31T06:36:55  <Error323> i have an idea for routing
2010-10-31T06:37:05  <Commandir> actually, sometimes it's correct to take them, if it's not a costly and gives you a positional advantage... tricky thing is for the bot to figure out when ;)
2010-10-31T06:37:07  <Error323> using some linear algebra :P
2010-10-31T06:37:46  <bhasker> this is another game
2010-10-31T06:37:47  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=790600
2010-10-31T06:37:56  <bhasker> you can see how my routing works
2010-10-31T06:38:15  <bhasker> yea its a very rare map on which taking the zero growth planet is useful
2010-10-31T06:38:17  <bhasker> unless its very cheap
2010-10-31T06:38:22  <bhasker> i would never take it
2010-10-31T06:38:30  <bhasker> those ships are better used attacking the enemy
2010-10-31T06:38:31  <bhasker> or defending
2010-10-31T06:38:43  <Error323> i agree
2010-10-31T06:39:06  <Error323> maximize growth, minimize enemy growth is i think the strategy to go for

2010-10-31T07:58:51  <delt0r> lol
2010-10-31T07:59:04  <delt0r> you i teach stats sometimes....  ;)
2010-10-31T07:59:15  <delt0r> you know^
2010-10-31T07:59:30  <antimatroid1> :P, but do you enjoy it?
2010-10-31T07:59:36  <delt0r> yea
2010-10-31T07:59:43  <delt0r> when its not first years
2010-10-31T07:59:45  <antimatroid1> applied maths is just so tedious and messy, i much prefer my pure courses
2010-10-31T07:59:47  <delt0r> first years su
2010-10-31T07:59:49  <delt0r> sux
2010-10-31T07:59:56  <antimatroid1> yeah, this is a third year intro to proper stats course
2010-10-31T08:00:10  <antimatroid1> it hasn't been too bad, but i hate studying for exams, and i'm doing a one day study effort
2010-10-31T08:00:31  <delt0r> should go from boring to hard quickly  then
2010-10-31T08:00:35  <antimatroid1> although couldn't use proper measure theory :(
2010-10-31T08:01:07  <delt0r> Ironically I sux and measure theory... :/
2010-10-31T08:01:22  <delt0r> always have to look that stuff up
2010-10-31T08:01:29  <antimatroid1> i sat through a post grad course for it this semester, i'm not sure it makes a lot of sense yet
2010-10-31T08:02:07  <delt0r> well its like a lot of pure math. 99% of the details don't matter for real applications most of the time
2010-10-31T08:02:26  <delt0r> bit like calculus
2010-10-31T08:02:28  <antimatroid1> i'm probably going to go the theory route anyway, so i'll need it
2010-10-31T08:02:52  <antimatroid1> i'm doing an honours year for maths next year with lots of analysis and algebra, that should be useful
2010-10-31T08:03:02  <delt0r> lol
2010-10-31T08:03:16  <antimatroid1> useful for my interests, not for anyone else :P
2010-10-31T08:03:17  <delt0r> well as i keep telling my pure math friends...
2010-10-31T08:03:33  <delt0r> us physics folk always find a real application.  :)
2010-10-31T08:03:52  <antimatroid1> i haven't taken any physics, i didn't even do it in year 12
2010-10-31T08:03:56  <antimatroid1> i kind of wish i had, but oh well
2010-10-31T08:04:12  <antimatroid1> i'm going to do a physics unit next year but it's more maths than anything
2010-10-31T08:04:13  <delt0r> if you are good at math --it would be easy
2010-10-31T08:04:27  <delt0r> and applied math... is physics IMO .. More or less
2010-10-31T08:04:34  <antimatroid1> it's called "symmetry principles and group theory in physics", which is pretty much an intro to lie groups and algebra
2010-10-31T08:04:34  <antimatroid1> s
2010-10-31T08:04:48  <antimatroid1> i disagree, i tend to think applied maths is science
2010-10-31T08:04:55  <delt0r> yea--popular for atemtps into GUT
2010-10-31T08:04:59  <antimatroid1> (i'm an economcis and cs student too)
2010-10-31T08:05:24  <antimatroid1> well, maths is sciences toolbox
2010-10-31T08:05:36  <delt0r> tell that to a biologist.
2010-10-31T08:05:42  <delt0r> or a doctor
2010-10-31T08:05:50  <antimatroid1> the better biologists are using maths these days
2010-10-31T08:05:55  <antimatroid1> and quite a lot of game theory
2010-10-31T08:06:03  <delt0r> yea--I am now in a bio department
2010-10-31T08:06:08  <antimatroid1> :P
2010-10-31T08:06:15  <delt0r> they get us to do the math --and stats
2010-10-31T08:06:21  <antimatroid1> yeah, the eco and cs departments at my uni suck for maths
2010-10-31T08:06:22  <sigh> wtf, how many fields are you working in delt0r
2010-10-31T08:06:35  <delt0r> then complain that we tell then the data they doesn't show what they want
2010-10-31T08:06:39  <delt0r> sigh: |Physics
2010-10-31T08:06:42  <delt0r> orginally
2010-10-31T08:06:53  <antimatroid1> yeah, people that do stats at my uni hate the other departments
2010-10-31T08:06:56  <sigh> :)
2010-10-31T08:06:57  <delt0r> about 1/3 of my work mates came from physics
2010-10-31T08:07:10  <antimatroid1> especially honours/phd students who come to them after collecting data completely wrong and being told they're fucked
2010-10-31T08:07:44  <delt0r> antimatroid1: yea
2010-10-31T08:08:11  <delt0r> sigh: the switching of fields is pretty prevalent generally
2010-10-31T08:08:28  <delt0r> the only time you hear "not a real XXX" is in news papers
2010-10-31T08:08:33  <antimatroid1> yeah i don't know where i'll end up yet, but if i do a phd i want it to be in game theory damnit
2010-10-31T08:08:36  <sigh> delt0r: fair enough :)

2010-10-31T13:42:46  <Migi32> demerzel_, nice that your bot sends defense at the last possible move. But don't you risk that it will use those ships for something else without realizing it will need the ships later for defense?
2010-10-31T13:42:52  <Migi32> or is your bot just that smart?
2010-10-31T13:43:03  <Migi32> If so, I have no chance at winning this contest :P
2010-10-31T13:43:11  <demerzel_> well it's jacked up atm
2010-10-31T13:43:20  <demerzel_> but yea it sends at the last possible second
2010-10-31T13:43:35  <demerzel_> it runs defense plans prior to 'attack' plans to make sure that doesn't happen tho in answer to your question
2010-10-31T13:44:02  <demerzel_> i have to add some kind of game state mechanism
2010-10-31T13:44:13  <demerzel_> it is choosing ok neutrals but pretty much ignoring the enemy status
2010-10-31T13:44:24  <demerzel_> and the added cost of taking an enemy means it will rarely go for it

2010-10-31T15:42:03  <Error323> thats why i didn't do anything

2010-10-31T15:42:30  <demerzel_> in theory at least ;)
2010-10-31T15:42:51  <bhasker> at turn 49
2010-10-31T15:42:55  <bhasker> you were already quite ahead

2010-10-31T15:43:36  <Error323> after 49 you attacked aswell

2010-10-31T15:44:08  <Error323> weird game
2010-10-31T15:44:13  <demerzel_> p0 is almost equidistant to all planets
2010-10-31T15:44:37  <demerzel_> would drive defense calcs crazy to hold it
2010-10-31T15:45:21  <Migi32> do all maps have a center planet?
2010-10-31T15:45:29  <demerzel_> yup
2010-10-31T15:45:32  <Error323> really
2010-10-31T15:45:32  <Migi32> oh
2010-10-31T15:45:34  <Error323> ?
2010-10-31T15:45:36  <Error323> mmm
2010-10-31T15:45:42  <demerzel_> in fact you can calc the width/height of the map by taking p0 x/y * 2
2010-10-31T15:46:12  <Migi32> and the center planet is always ID 0?
2010-10-31T15:46:21  <demerzel_> yup
2010-10-31T15:46:25  <demerzel_> look at map_generator
2010-10-31T15:46:26  <Migi32> interesting
2010-10-31T15:46:42  <bhasker> actually my bot never calculates the size of the map
2010-10-31T15:46:43  <demerzel_> it basically puts p0 at 0,0 then at the end it takes the highest x/y and divides by 2
2010-10-31T15:46:44  <bhasker> ^
2010-10-31T15:46:49  <demerzel_> yea i don't either
2010-10-31T15:47:02  <demerzel_> i never look at x/y past calcing distances on turn 1 but i have played with it
2010-10-31T15:47:05  <demerzel_> too damn hard
2010-10-31T15:47:11  <demerzel_> to get anything useful
2010-10-31T15:47:41  <Migi32> well maybe the diameter of the map is useful
2010-10-31T15:48:06  <demerzel_> if you figure out a useful way to use it let me know
2010-10-31T15:48:10  <demerzel_> i tried for a while
2010-10-31T15:48:30  <demerzel_> way too many variables
2010-10-31T15:48:43  <Migi32> demerzel_, I heard some people use it to resolve fleets in flight for D turns, where D is the diameter of the map
2010-10-31T15:48:50  <Migi32> then look at which planets they still own
2010-10-31T15:49:06  <demerzel_> i guess i am giving away a partial secret but i use max distance for that
2010-10-31T15:49:26  <Migi32> the diameter is the max distance: P
2010-10-31T15:49:26  <demerzel_> ie when i calc the distances i just pop the biggest one into an int then i know past +maxdistance turns nothing new is going on
2010-10-31T15:49:29  <demerzel_> no
2010-10-31T15:49:34  <demerzel_> in fact it could be less
2010-10-31T15:49:59  <demerzel_> max distance from any px1 to any px2
2010-10-31T15:50:27  <demerzel_> it's usually between 24-30 vs. the maps being 24x24ish
2010-10-31T15:50:39  <Migi32> no the diameter is really the max distance. It's per definition. I was wrong to think you could use the width/height of the map to calculate the diameter
2010-10-31T15:50:40  <Error323> bhasker: you are aware that i won that game right? :>
2010-10-31T15:50:49  <Migi32> you can only find an upper bound.
2010-10-31T15:51:08  <demerzel_> oh well yea but why do all that math calc if your'e caching distances anyawy
2010-10-31T15:51:21  <demerzel_> the only useful number to know is actual max distance not a euclidean calc'd one
2010-10-31T15:51:30  <demerzel_> altho it would work
2010-10-31T15:52:13  <Migi32> but you're right. I was actually thinking about using "local calculations", where my bot thinks it's playing on an infinite field and only looks at planets in a radius of x
2010-10-31T15:52:30  <Error323> in contrast to the last against v11 of mine

2010-10-31T15:55:10  <Frontier> bhasker: Ok... if I push_back a new object into a vector it can happen that copy constructors for already inserted objects are called during resize.
2010-10-31T15:55:27  <Migi32> so, find the optimal thing to do for x=1 (easy), then recursively try to find the optimal thing to do for x=n, somehow making use of the information we got about x<n
2010-10-31T15:56:16  <Migi32> didn't really work out though
2010-10-31T15:58:54  <demerzel_> yea that to me justs adds unneeded complexity
2010-10-31T15:59:13  <demerzel_> you should be automatically biased towards closer targets because the farther i get the mroe i have to account for enemy and the less payoff
2010-10-31T15:59:18  <Migi32> I switch techniques about once every 2 days though. And no technique seems to be made for this problem.
2010-10-31T15:59:47  <Migi32> I still believe humans, with a little bit of experience and infinite time given per move, could beat top bots no problem.
2010-10-31T15:59:59  <Error323> its really difficult to make accurate predictions when trying to capture an enemy planet
2010-10-31T16:00:04  <Error323> >_<
2010-10-31T16:01:06  <demerzel_> i have zero prediction problem, just run actual turn logic
2010-10-31T16:01:12  <demerzel_> rather than trying to check fleets on the fly
2010-10-31T16:01:53  <demerzel_> i basically just add in fleets to int [201] for my fleets and enemy fleets then at turn start run turn logic on all planets starting this turn
2010-10-31T16:02:00  <demerzel_> fleet totals*
2010-10-31T16:02:10  <demerzel_> it takes wayyy less time than checking stuff individually
2010-10-31T16:02:24  <demerzel_> and much less error-prone

2010-10-31T16:12:45  <Migi32> demerzel_, but he probably didn't realize that if you return a std::vector in C++ you're copying it around :P

2010-10-31T16:13:30  <Error323> mkay fair enough
2010-10-31T16:13:43  <raedwulf> i don't know Java nor Python, didn't realise Lua was available and didn't feel like writing it in an old dialect of C#
2010-10-31T16:13:43  <demerzel_> in the C# one for example it concatenates one character at a time to a string for the entire input
2010-10-31T16:13:59  <demerzel_> which in C# is a destroy/recreate of the string every time

2010-10-31T16:15:12  <raedwulf> yea, maybe but im unfamiliar with the standard libraries hehe :P
2010-10-31T16:15:29  <demerzel_> raedwulf: but if you're a C guy you use mostly structs anyway ;)
2010-10-31T16:15:32  <raedwulf> and also, it almost forces you to use an IDE
2010-10-31T16:15:48  <demerzel_> yea java IDEs are definitely the biggest drawback to developing in it lol
2010-10-31T16:15:58  <raedwulf> i use vim
2010-10-31T16:16:03  <demerzel_> i spent days and days before settling on intellij

2010-10-31T16:17:56  <raedwulf> about 2 weeks to make it as usable as a "conventional" editor
2010-10-31T16:18:11  <demerzel_> i hate vim
2010-10-31T16:18:11  <raedwulf> now it far surpasses that
2010-10-31T16:18:13  <demerzel_> a lot
2010-10-31T16:18:23  <Migi32> I tried using vim once, was able to write exactly 0 words in it :P

2010-10-31T16:23:15  <raedwulf> meh my thoughts required complex code so its 95% writing and 5% thinking
2010-10-31T16:23:26  <demerzel_> yea i write way more than i plan

2010-10-31T16:23:47  <raedwulf> actually i use cgdb sometimes
2010-10-31T16:23:55  <raedwulf> so there's no draw from vs anymore
2010-10-31T16:23:57  <raedwulf> lol
2010-10-31T16:24:21  <Migi32> development so far went like this: write a shitty bot, delete everything, repeat 3 times, then write only support functions/classes + think about how your bot is going to work
2010-10-31T16:24:59  <Migi32> I almost got it :P
2010-10-31T16:25:03  <Error323> haha

2010-10-31T16:25:12  <Error323> thats not a good approach imo
2010-10-31T16:25:23  <raedwulf> Migi32: hehe, i wrote base code + wrote C version of bully bot and rage bot to test base code + wrote support routines + more support routines + made use of some support routines to make a very very bad bot + deleted that code + wrote more support routines + more support routines + currently working on ai rules
2010-10-31T16:25:48  <raedwulf> the ai rules are scratched out on a piece of paper
2010-10-31T16:25:56  <raedwulf> but im too tired to implement them
2010-10-31T16:26:14  <raedwulf> i did brief testing to see if some of my support routines worked earlier, they seem to

2010-10-31T16:29:35  <Frontier> assigning a reference to a reference calls operator= in C++? I thought it was like assigning a pointer to a pointer :(
2010-10-31T16:30:06  <demerzel_> why would you need to do that
2010-10-31T16:30:27  <Migi32> Frontier, you can't change the pointer-value of a reference. Why otherwise would there be a difference between a pointer and a reference?
2010-10-31T16:30:29  <demerzel_> and no int* i = *j should work that way
2010-10-31T16:31:29  <demerzel_> oh reference

2010-10-31T16:34:58  <Frontier> And there is really no way to change the reference to another object? I thought I did that some times. Then again... I better check those code locations twice when I come across them ^^

2010-10-31T16:52:21  <Frontier> Migi32: Out of couriosity: Do you use objects or pointers in your vectors and maps?
2010-10-31T16:52:48  <Migi32> pointers of course
2010-10-31T16:53:10  <demerzel_> uh protip: pointers are for c use objects
2010-10-31T16:53:18  <demerzel_> ;)
2010-10-31T16:53:53  <Frontier> Oo ...of course? But the vectors will automagically free your objects when they get deleted!
2010-10-31T16:53:54  <Migi32> if you use objects, then you take a pointer to an element of your vector, then you delete an element of your vector and suddenly your pointer is pointing to the wrong thing

2010-10-31T16:56:47  <Migi32> Frontier, I don't make fun of you. I made the same mistakes one day. But if you use objects you have to promise yourself to never delete stuff from the middle of the vector as long as you have pointers to elements of that vector
2010-10-31T16:57:12  <Migi32> not only delete stuff, also add new stuff
2010-10-31T16:57:15  <demerzel_> wait now i'm confused i thought Frontier was being ironic
2010-10-31T16:57:32  <demerzel_> i'm just giving Migi32 shit about his protip about vectors lol
2010-10-31T16:58:23  <Migi32> I'm sorry demerzel_ I will never do it again :)
2010-10-31T16:58:38  <Frontier> no, I was dead serious, and seeing that a vector resize will call copy constructors of all my objects I feel more and more like using pointer lists in the future and free them myself
2010-10-31T16:59:12  <demerzel_> Migi32: i'm just messing with you - it did get tiresome reading 20 protips about "just use vectors" when i was trying to figure out if i could init an array in a member list
2010-10-31T16:59:20  <demerzel_> answer: no
2010-10-31T16:59:53  <Migi32> demerzel_, ah yes, that. Can't do that with vectors either. At least not until the next version of c++
2010-10-31T17:00:14  <Frontier> hehe, like PlanetWars(int planet_cnt) : m_planets[planet_cnt] { ...} ?
2010-10-31T17:00:24  <demerzel_> yea somethng like that
2010-10-31T17:00:35  <demerzel_> but in the process i found the magic of planet p = {0};
2010-10-31T17:00:41  <demerzel_> so i ended up happy anyway
2010-10-31T17:00:41  <Migi32> Frontier, yes, that's what you should do. Unless your objects are so small that you don't mind copying them around (for example if they're 1 or 2 ints big)
2010-10-31T17:01:00  <demerzel_> you can't init them in the member list tho
2010-10-31T17:01:14  * mega1 has just started a bot on tcp ... in case someone wants to test
2010-10-31T17:01:26  <demerzel_> however if you have a struct with an array and you do struct s = {0} it will auto-init the arrays

2010-10-31T17:37:00  <demerzel_> Migi32: i think i got it but my no incoming code needs work apparently lol
2010-10-31T17:37:02  <Migi32> it makes use of some support classes though, so perhaps the whole code written out would be 200-ish lines
2010-10-31T17:38:35  <demerzel_> there we go!  damn
2010-10-31T17:40:06  <demerzel_> gotta graduate from broken bot to stupid bot before i can make it smarter lol

2010-10-31T18:01:38  <Frontier> Migi32: the next pit fall: I omitted a destructor in a base class because I didn't need one. Turns out the compiler created a default non-virtual destructor and the destructors of my derieved classes were never called.
2010-10-31T18:02:12  <Migi32> Frontier, do you use any IDE?
2010-10-31T18:02:40  <Migi32> when I make a new class, it automatically makes a copy-constructor and a virtual destructor
2010-10-31T18:05:17  <Frontier> I thought I would be better of letting the compiler create these on the fly, especially the copy-ctor, when I don't need deep pointer copies
2010-10-31T18:09:49  <demerzel_> i use static methods and singletons almost exclusively
2010-10-31T18:09:55  <demerzel_> saves a lot of hassle

2010-10-31T18:17:36  <Frontier> demerzel_: The faulty code was in a spot where I transfer game states to both bots in a mirrored view and cache initial map game states to allow for batch runs with multiple bots and maps. It makes sense to use a copy-ctor there now and then.
2010-10-31T18:19:02  <TravisD> It seems to me that the difficulty in this competition should be in the strategy, lol
2010-10-31T18:22:49  <demerzel_> TravisD: if the starter packs included the dozen or so metrics you actually need for advanced strategy it would be ;)
2010-10-31T18:23:14  <TravisD> what metrics are those?
2010-10-31T18:23:46  <demerzel_> things like shipsatturn, underattack, max enemy/friendly to planet, closer enemy/friendly to planet, closest friendly/enemy
2010-10-31T18:23:49  <demerzel_> that kind of stuff
2010-10-31T18:24:15  <TravisD> these things are fairly easy to implement, aren't they?
2010-10-31T18:24:29  <demerzel_> yes and putting a roof on a house is fairly easy to implement
2010-10-31T18:24:34  <demerzel_> it just takes time and you can screw it up
2010-10-31T18:24:54  <demerzel_> not to mention some of them are reliant on others
2010-10-31T18:25:02  <TravisD> I guess, lol
2010-10-31T18:26:43  <demerzel_> tbf my current implementation is incredibly ambitious
2010-10-31T18:27:05  <TravisD> how so?
2010-10-31T18:27:11  <demerzel_> but i figure better to have a super complex framework to underuse than vice versa
2010-10-31T18:27:55  <demerzel_> too much detail but essentially isolating every individual detail into its own island
2010-10-31T18:28:05  <demerzel_> or rather details associated with actions

2010-10-31T18:29:10  <TravisD> arent' all minimax searches branching? :P
2010-10-31T18:29:18  <demerzel_> i guess
2010-10-31T18:29:31  <demerzel_> why don't you take an hour out of your irc time and whip up a #1 bot?
2010-10-31T18:29:37  <demerzel_> pretty easy shit
2010-10-31T18:30:37  <TravisD> Lol, I was just pointing out that minimax is an adversarial tree search algorithm, so calling a particular instance of it branching is kind of redundant.
2010-10-31T18:33:16  <TravisD> anyways, I am working on a bot too. A pretty terrible one too, haha
2010-10-31T18:34:20  <demerzel_> that's a minimax strategy which i am not really fond of
2010-10-31T18:34:39  <demerzel_> i'm talking individual minmax moves checking against subsequent ones as to the best combination
2010-10-31T18:35:18  <demerzel_> i guess in game theory jargon it would be a pure strategy

2010-10-31T22:39:46  <McLeopold> amstan: python compiling to bytecode only speeds up the load time, not the run time
2010-10-31T22:39:52  <McLeopold> fyi
2010-10-31T22:40:27  <amstan> i know, you'd think other languages like this would do the same
2010-10-31T22:40:37  <amstan> i don't think any language just parses while it's running
2010-10-31T22:41:14  <McLeopold> how about basica?  or gwbasic?
2010-10-31T22:41:28  <amstan> i mean popular languages
2010-10-31T22:41:29  <McLeopold> I want to code with line numbers and edlin!
2010-10-31T22:41:39  <McLeopold> :)
2010-10-31T22:41:58  <amstan> anyway.. it will still speed up that first turn
2010-10-31T22:42:13  <amstan> and.. users could be informed of syntax errors after they uploaded
2010-10-31T22:42:23  <McLeopold> that's a good point
2010-10-31T22:42:24  <amstan> if python gets compiled
2010-10-31T22:42:35  <McLeopold> it could have saved me some frustration

2010-10-31T23:08:04  <demerzel_> i've got values disappearing in c++ and i can't figure out why :(

2010-10-31T23:13:11  <bhasker> what do you mean disappearing?
2010-10-31T23:13:32  <bhasker> btw anyone wanna share how does one implement a naive minmax for something like this
2010-10-31T23:13:47  <bhasker> i am confused about what is a move in this game for something like minmax
2010-10-31T23:13:48  <antimatroid> what do you want do know?
2010-10-31T23:13:52  <bhasker> is it a set of moves
2010-10-31T23:13:55  <bhasker> per turn
2010-10-31T23:13:59  <antimatroid> you can do it a number of ways
2010-10-31T23:14:03  <bhasker> and you evaluate the whole thing
2010-10-31T23:14:10  <bhasker> or do you do one turn and evaluate from there
2010-10-31T23:14:18  <antimatroid> i didn't have much sucess doing all moves for a turn at each node and incrementing states
2010-10-31T23:14:53  <antimatroid> your other option is you pick one move per node, and have the player make their single move next etc. then pick your string of moves for the given minimax chosen node
2010-10-31T23:15:05  <bhasker> oh hmm
2010-10-31T23:15:05  <antimatroid> by one move, I have one destination, but many sources
2010-10-31T23:15:24  <bhasker> and what do you evaluate the position next turn
2010-10-31T23:15:31  <bhasker> or the position at the end of the orders just executed?
2010-10-31T23:15:33  <antimatroid> or use decision trees, where you pick one move per node, but each tree is just for one player
2010-10-31T23:15:37  <antimatroid> then pick your best string
2010-10-31T23:15:56  <antimatroid> my current play is to use decision tree's for each player, but pick all terminal nodes and use those as pure strategies for a zero sum simultaneous game
2010-10-31T23:16:18  <demerzel_> i am still a little confused about why array[i].blah = array2[i].blah2 won't assign but &array[i]->blah = array2[i].blah will
2010-10-31T23:16:19  <antimatroid> depends, i have a function that will "playANode" where each player just runs defensive and offensive moves
2010-10-31T23:16:20  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-10-31T23:16:27  <antimatroid> and if i have time, i'll run my gamestates before evaluating them
2010-10-31T23:16:37  <demerzel_> if blah is an int that is
2010-10-31T23:16:44  <bhasker> k this is way too complicated, sigh i wonder if i wil be able to write one up
2010-10-31T23:16:57  <antimatroid> work it out on paper, it's not too bad
2010-10-31T23:17:00  <sigh> hmmm?
2010-10-31T23:17:01  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-10-31T23:17:05  <sigh> oh
2010-10-31T23:17:07  <bhasker> not at you sigh:p
2010-10-31T23:17:07  <antimatroid> sigh: i knew that'd happen
2010-10-31T23:17:19  <demerzel_> minmax for me is simply score at end vs score at end for enemy
2010-10-31T23:17:22  <bhasker> whats your type for array demerzel
2010-10-31T23:17:31  <demerzel_> bhasker: int on both
2010-10-31T23:17:40  <demerzel_> bhasker: static int arrays local to the function called
2010-10-31T23:17:59  <demerzel_> idk why but it would assign array[i].blah fine
2010-10-31T23:18:09  <demerzel_> but then as soon as it went out of scope the values disappeared
2010-10-31T23:18:23  <antimatroid> be back in a bit
2010-10-31T23:18:31  <bhasker> hmm if it went out of scope it would go away right?
2010-10-31T23:18:43  <demerzel_> but they are both static int arrays
2010-10-31T23:18:53  <demerzel_> the function went out of scope but the values would still be there
2010-10-31T23:18:54  <bhasker> can you give me the declaration for it
2010-10-31T23:19:02  <bhasker> or maybe paste the function somewhere
2010-10-31T23:19:13  <demerzel_> i just use {0}
2010-10-31T23:19:25  <demerzel_> ie Class::staticintarray[size] = {0};
2010-10-31T23:20:25  <bhasker> hmm that syntax doesn't compute can you paste it on pastebin.com
2010-10-31T23:20:32  <demerzel_> sure
2010-10-31T23:28:12  <demerzel_> bhasker: http://pastebin.com/6PFxyNXn -- i hope i didn't make it too hard to read was trying to clarify things
2010-10-31T23:29:08  <demerzel_> bhasker: basically if i used structWithArray1 ci = structArr1_[i]; on line 8
2010-10-31T23:29:34  <demerzel_> bhasker: and then assigned using ci.intX = i could pause it on line 27 and all the values would be there but as soon as it left the if the values disappeared
2010-10-31T23:29:40  <demerzel_> that version works though
2010-10-31T23:29:43  <bhasker> give me a few minutes to read up
2010-10-31T23:29:46  <demerzel_> and i have no idea why that is
2010-10-31T23:29:55  <demerzel_> ok ty
2010-10-31T23:30:07  <demerzel_> i would like to know because even tho it works now it is weird as hell and i'm wondering what i did wrong

2010-10-31T23:34:03  <bhasker> well your structWithArray1 ci = structArr_[i] creates a local copy
2010-10-31T23:34:08  <bhasker> local to the function scope
2010-10-31T23:34:12  <bhasker> of the structure
2010-10-31T23:34:16  <sigh> yup, "structWithArray1* ci" is a pointer to the existing array, "structWithArray1 ci" is a completely new array
2010-10-31T23:34:34  <bhasker> so when it goes out of scope it gets destroyed
2010-10-31T23:34:39  <bhasker> and your original array is unchanged
2010-10-31T23:36:11  <antimatroid> bacl
2010-10-31T23:36:20  <antimatroid> bhasker: sort of know how to do it now?
2010-10-31T23:36:35  <antimatroid> i'm not sure minimax is going to work very well though
2010-10-31T23:36:39  <bhasker> not really :( been reading up the wikipedia article
2010-10-31T23:36:54  <bhasker> i get the basic drift just can't seem to understand how to apply it to this game
2010-10-31T23:37:02  <sigh> minimax?
2010-10-31T23:37:03  <antimatroid> do you know how do do minimax on normal trees?
2010-10-31T23:37:15  <bhasker> minmax*
2010-10-31T23:37:15  <bhasker> doh
2010-10-31T23:37:28  <bhasker> kind of read the theory but never really implemented it
2010-10-31T23:37:42  <demerzel_> bhasker: duh ty
2010-10-31T23:37:46  <sigh> easiest way is to assume that your opponent goes second (ie knows what moves you make)
2010-10-31T23:37:46  <antimatroid> i'd say pull out some pen and paper then

2010-10-31T23:38:09  <demerzel_> i am pure max atm
2010-10-31T23:38:10  <antimatroid> yeah, i always let the opponent make their optimal move against me rather than vice versa
2010-10-31T23:38:15  <demerzel_> min is hard lol
2010-10-31T23:38:31  <sigh> yeah, my bot is pure max too, now
2010-10-31T23:38:32  <antimatroid> hardest part is doing future states for both players with both making future moves
2010-10-31T23:38:32  <bhasker> hmm k
2010-10-31T23:38:38  <TravisD> Do people here actually have minimax implemented for this game? How many ply deep do you get? Do you treat one turn as one ply?
2010-10-31T23:38:52  <antimatroid> I do, but my choice selection is god awful
2010-10-31T23:39:08  <TravisD> antimatroid: isn't minimax generally an exhaustive search?
2010-10-31T23:39:09  <antimatroid> i have done a combination of things, many moves per node with many stages, one move per node etc.
2010-10-31T23:39:16  <sigh> I plan to implement proper minimax, I've just been very lazy
2010-10-31T23:39:20  <antimatroid> no, you can do it part way and evaluate game states
2010-10-31T23:39:35  <TravisD> antimatroid: yeah, but you don't leave out actions from each node
2010-10-31T23:39:40  <antimatroid> i'm currently thinking a simultaneous zero sum game might work better
2010-10-31T23:39:45  <sigh> TravisD: it doesn't have to be, you can prune heuristically
2010-10-31T23:39:52  <antimatroid> but i need to fix my move selection before my macro ideas are going to do any good
2010-10-31T23:40:17  <TravisD> sigh: sure, but then you lose all the nice guarantees
2010-10-31T23:40:21  <antimatroid> each node is only picking like it's best 3-6 moves
2010-10-31T23:40:30  <antimatroid> you're not going to get anywhere unless you restrict it to that
2010-10-31T23:40:48  <sigh> TravisD: sure, but exhaustive search is intractable
2010-10-31T23:40:50  <TravisD> Have you heard about adversarial monte carlo tree search?
2010-10-31T23:40:51  <antimatroid> that's why i am doing one move per node, then picking the best string for that moves turns
2010-10-31T23:40:57  <antimatroid> nope
2010-10-31T23:40:59  <sigh> TravisD: is that like UCT?
2010-10-31T23:41:06  <TravisD> sigh: exactly
2010-10-31T23:41:15  <sigh> no, haven't heard of it
2010-10-31T23:41:26  <TravisD> lol
2010-10-31T23:41:52  <antimatroid> the tree for this game is fucking huge remember
2010-10-31T23:41:57  <sigh> I remember someone on the channel implementing it a while back... can't remember who
2010-10-31T23:42:07  <antimatroid> i think you really need to just be using it to pick between what you think are best moves
2010-10-31T23:42:09  <antimatroid> anything else and you
2010-10-31T23:42:13  <antimatroid> re not going to get anything
2010-10-31T23:42:13  <sigh> grep the channel logs for UCT and you'll probably find it
2010-10-31T23:42:32  <TravisD> antimatroid: UCT has been used for planning with huge state spaces before.
2010-10-31T23:42:51  <TravisD> sigh: Thanks :)
2010-10-31T23:42:57  <sigh> most famously for Go :P
2010-10-31T23:43:12  <TravisD> sigh: yes :)
2010-10-31T23:43:39  <TravisD> sigh: Are you a graduate student?
2010-10-31T23:43:51  <demerzel_> goddamn i think i finally worked out all the bugs
2010-10-31T23:44:02  <sigh> nope, I've only done a bachelor's
2010-10-31T23:44:05  <demerzel_> thanks bhasker i needed a basic reminder - wayyyy too used to directly doing array[index] =
2010-10-31T23:44:23  <TravisD> cool
2010-10-31T23:44:25  <antimatroid> it's hard to find anything on uct's
2010-10-31T23:44:41  <demerzel_> guessing the last 2 words are combsomething trees
2010-10-31T23:44:50  <sigh> antimatroid: http://senseis.xmp.net/?UCT
2010-10-31T23:44:56  <antimatroid> upper confidence bounds on trees
2010-10-31T23:45:03  <demerzel_> ahh
2010-10-31T23:45:04  <demerzel_> hmm
2010-10-31T23:45:14  <sigh> taht page has the bonus of some code
2010-10-31T23:47:08  <antimatroid> atm i extend my trees from a queue of extendable nodes, i've considered making that a priority queue, but i have no idea how to set up the < operator on Nodes to ensure it doesn't just completely ignore old nodes and do it well
2010-10-31T23:47:26  <TravisD> antimatroid: http://tinyurl.com/2vhxxg3 is the paper introducing it
2010-10-31T23:47:45  <antimatroid> TravisD: what do you do?
2010-10-31T23:47:58  <antimatroid> ah, it makes sense now
2010-10-31T23:48:00  <TravisD> antimatroid: I'm a student
2010-10-31T23:48:08  <antimatroid> that paper is from hungary, mega1 is Levente or Csaba
2010-10-31T23:49:08  <sigh> TravisD: it was phreeza who was implementing a UCT bot
2010-10-31T23:49:39  <TravisD> sigh: cool :) I haven't thought too much about it, it just sounds like it could be applied
2010-10-31T23:50:20  <antimatroid> i think bacsimocko is doing the zero sum game approach
2010-10-31T23:50:44  <sigh> well, he had a basic one up and running about 2 weeks ago, I don't know if he had any luck since making it any good
2010-10-31T23:50:44  <antimatroid> not in his current version, but has been trying it
2010-10-31T23:50:52  <sigh> *phreeza_
2010-10-31T23:51:15  <sigh> antimatroid: that's what you wanted to try, no?
2010-10-31T23:51:27  <antimatroid> yeah, i have it set up, need to fix up choice selection
2010-10-31T23:51:41  <antimatroid> i already had most of that set up for another library, just had to rework things for matrices to take nodes etc.
2010-10-31T23:54:14  <TravisD> its kind of interesting since the game isn't quite zero sum
2010-10-31T23:56:40  <demerzel_> i don't know if uct is more helpful than mc in this because the likelihood of repeat moves is low
