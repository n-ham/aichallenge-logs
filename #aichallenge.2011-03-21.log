2011-03-21T00:00:53  <Frontier> we could use that, but if we do it right the replay file will become bigger. we discussed that already
2011-03-21T00:01:11  <Frontier> sigh: don't do that. this is an important decision :p
2011-03-21T00:02:24  <Frontier> someone will find some reason next term not to use json ^^, but we could write the metadata in that fashion
2011-03-21T00:02:54  <Frontier> then again... is that easier then to use '#%' comments?
2011-03-21T00:03:03  <sigh> json is more work than prepending a file with a few lines, but it is ok
2011-03-21T00:04:21  * sigh will agree with anything that doesn't put the metadata at the end

2011-03-21T00:07:54  <Frontier> a json parser may not like other data in the same stream. it is an either or decision. and i doubt that all our replays can be expressed in json efficiently. so i come to the conclusion that the initial comment idea is the best so far.
2011-03-21T00:08:40  <sigh> ok
2011-03-21T00:08:40  <amstan> sigh: i agree, lol, this is pretty trivial, yet it's one of the most discussed topics in here, lol
2011-03-21T00:11:54  <Frontier> we are almost done. how do we handle array-like stuff in the metadata? currently we agreed on 'playername <id> <name>'. or do we want strictly key-value pairs and not keys with variable argument counts?
2011-03-21T00:12:06  <amstan> so.. my idea for json replay: https://gist.github.com/878995
2011-03-21T00:12:15  <Frontier> oh let me take a look
2011-03-21T00:13:48  <amstan> @botrepo
2011-03-21T00:13:49  <Frontier> hehe, that is planetwars style, but ok. you'll have to escape the invalid characters in the replay data and there will be two formats. on 'elementary' replay file and one wrapped in the cool ai-contest replay wrapper
2011-03-21T00:13:49  <contestbot> amstan: botrepo = http://github.com/amstan/contestbot
2011-03-21T00:14:03  <Frontier> *one
2011-03-21T00:14:04  <amstan> Frontier: isn't that what we wanted?
2011-03-21T00:14:29  <Frontier> i wanted a single replay file that can be extended with metadata
2011-03-21T00:14:49  <amstan> contestbot: echo [forget botrepo] [learn https://github.com/aichallenge/contestbot as botrepo]
2011-03-21T00:14:49  <contestbot> Yep. As you wish.
2011-03-21T00:15:21  <Frontier> so a single parser could read replays with or without metadata and need not even understand metadata
2011-03-21T00:15:48  <Frontier> but i guess the json approach looks very appealing
2011-03-21T00:16:47  <Frontier> actually we will have 3 formats, as there is also the live stream format from McLeopold. :p
2011-03-21T00:16:48  <amstan> so the only place there's no reason to not have json is between bots and the engine, because json libraries in most languages are annoying to include in the starter packs
2011-03-21T00:17:00  <amstan> everywhere else, i would recommend using them
2011-03-21T00:17:13  <amstan> oh.. the bots and the lengthy replays, yes
2011-03-21T00:17:35  <amstan> Frontier: live stream format is also one of those blob ones..
2011-03-21T00:18:02  <sigh> I'm with frontier on this, just stick some lines at the top of the file
2011-03-21T00:18:42  <amstan> i'm ok with that, but if you guys want futureproofing... i'd go with json
2011-03-21T00:18:57  <amstan> but... nvm futureproofing, it's not like we'll be using the manager from epsilon from now on
2011-03-21T00:19:05  <amstan> except ants
2011-03-21T00:19:16  <Frontier> the whole point for me is a futureproof metadata system
2011-03-21T00:19:37  <amstan> json will be more futureproof than our homebrew format
2011-03-21T00:19:45  <Frontier> amstan: we will still need metadata in zeta, won't we?
2011-03-21T00:20:05  <amstan> yes, but i still recommend json
2011-03-21T00:20:27  <sigh> Frontier: everyone is now ok with your format, no need to argue anymore
2011-03-21T00:20:57  <amstan> Frontier: you have the final call anyway.. we're just your consultants
2011-03-21T00:21:09  <amstan> and yes, we're ok
2011-03-21T00:21:47  <Frontier> amstan: You will be with this project for a longer time than me. If this gets phased out for json in zeta, then there is no point in using comments
2011-03-21T00:22:41  <amstan> the only code that we'll be able to reuse in zeta from epsilon in this regard will be some manager code

2011-03-21T00:23:26  <amstan> so idk if there's a point in worrying so much about future compatibility

2011-03-21T00:25:00  <Frontier> the software may be rewritten from scratch, but the file formats are usually upwards compatible. so before someone else says metadata in comments sucks, i rather use a json wrapper :)
2011-03-21T00:26:02  <Frontier> it is like MPEG then. You have Program Streams that contain metadata and interleaved packets from streams and elementary streams, which lack even timing data.
2011-03-21T00:27:33  <Frontier> the json version is the .mpg file with all the metadata and the raw output from the engine is the elementary stream. that makes sense to me as i worked with mpeg files for a company a few years ago
2011-03-21T00:28:55  <Frontier> i say we move the version information (i.e. 'v ants 1') into the json part as well.
2011-03-21T00:29:38  <Frontier> game: "ants", format: "1" (or "stream" and "storage")
2011-03-21T00:29:54  <amstan> Frontier: when versioning, try to keep git in mind, either make a tag and referrence that, or referrence the particular commit
2011-03-21T00:30:06  <amstan> Frontier: sounds good
2011-03-21T00:32:28  <Frontier> I believe McLeopold can agree on that, too. And you finally have your bike shed in the style of JSON :p
2011-03-21T00:34:28  <amstan> lol
2011-03-21T00:37:25  <Frontier> sigh: The lengthy argument is over, you can come back

2011-03-21T03:08:55  <antimatroid> that's awesome
2011-03-21T03:08:58  <janzert> nope, where are the buttons supposed to be, below the main view?
2011-03-21T03:09:22  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-21T03:09:23  <janzert> I like the way the graphs are coming along at the top
2011-03-21T03:10:03  <janzert> weird, on third refresh with firebug turned on they showed up
2011-03-21T03:10:47  <janzert> and now they seem to consistently be there
2011-03-21T03:10:53  <Frontier> hmm, someone else had issues on safari, too until he opened the dev console.
2011-03-21T03:11:04  <Frontier> I don't know what it is though.
2011-03-21T03:11:22  <janzert> ugh, that makes it hard to debug
2011-03-21T03:11:27  <antimatroid> janzert, Frontier: what do you two think about sighs new battle resolutions?
2011-03-21T03:11:45  <Stocha> im' litlle worried for computing time given to bots at the moment.
2011-03-21T03:11:49  <Frontier> antimatroid: I am glad that this is not my front ^^
2011-03-21T03:11:53  <antimatroid> each ant dishes out 1 damange each turn, 1/#enemiesinrange to each enemy, if an enemy has >= 1 damage, they die
2011-03-21T03:12:05  <Stocha> i save there ware inconstistencies to what was given to bot in planet war also.
2011-03-21T03:12:07  <antimatroid> Frontier: :P
2011-03-21T03:12:11  <antimatroid> it's still good to get opinions
2011-03-21T03:12:21  <antimatroid> Stocha: inconsistencies?
2011-03-21T03:12:27  <Stocha> I think this ant things will need quite a punch even for very basic things
2011-03-21T03:12:37  <janzert> I think I like it on first glance at least
2011-03-21T03:12:52  <antimatroid> it means a..b..c or a..b..a just kills b
2011-03-21T03:12:55  <Stocha> peoples complaining they had only 500 milliseconds rather than 1000
2011-03-21T03:13:05  <antimatroid> which i think makes cooperation much more prominent
2011-03-21T03:13:05  <Frontier> jeff /hates/ health bars
2011-03-21T03:13:12  <antimatroid> there is no health bar
2011-03-21T03:13:20  <antimatroid> you go back to 1 health essentially each turn
2011-03-21T03:13:23  <Stocha> or that the 1000 millisecond could mean 1 instruction as well as 100000. Depending on randome external event.
2011-03-21T03:13:31  <antimatroid> so you "recover after battle"
2011-03-21T03:13:52  <antimatroid> it's a lot like option 1 (not the same), but meant to be easier to understand
2011-03-21T03:13:53  <janzert> I think with collisions always die instead of collision orders are just canceled some of the old rules that were thrown out may make sense now too
2011-03-21T03:14:18  <antimatroid> yeah, and points will be assigned for colliding enemies
2011-03-21T03:14:39  <janzert> but this is seems a nice intuitive method that should have interesting play
2011-03-21T03:14:41  <Frontier> Stocha: at least the bots will run sequentially
2011-03-21T03:14:43  <Stocha> I do on basic things at the moment, and with many ants, it can begin to be slow. I see no way to hope for counting ennemies on different tree hypothesis.
2011-03-21T03:15:02  <Stocha> Solving basic food gathering take quite some cpu power also.
2011-03-21T03:15:11  <antimatroid> Stocha: assuming you have lots of ants, you're only going to be looking one state in the future
2011-03-21T03:15:22  <antimatroid> you only really need to do the battle resolution at your terminal nodes
2011-03-21T03:15:37  <antimatroid> i don't think food gathering will be that expensive
2011-03-21T03:15:40  <Stocha> why do we need complex rule then ? if we can do no anticipation ?
2011-03-21T03:15:52  <Stocha> I made a basic food gathering engine.
2011-03-21T03:15:53  <antimatroid> just paint out from each known food square at the start of the turn, moving the ants you want
2011-03-21T03:16:11  <Stocha> As i don't know the computing power each turn, i assume the worth
2011-03-21T03:16:30  <Stocha> i feel uncomfortable with only food gathering and basic ant movement at the momement. :p
2011-03-21T03:16:48  <antimatroid> so do we, hence the desire for interesting attacks
2011-03-21T03:17:11  <Stocha> If you said : an i5 machine with one cpu fully supporting you, for 2 minutes / turns, i could be more relaxed
2011-03-21T03:17:30  <Stocha> i have got no idea what the hard will be, and what amount of computing that will mean.
2011-03-21T03:17:58  <Stocha> when i say i feel uncomfortable i mean : it needs cpu
2011-03-21T03:17:59  <antimatroid> you will get like 0.5 seconds a turn
2011-03-21T03:18:00  <Stocha> to get it right.
2011-03-21T03:18:27  <antimatroid> we wont be going below that anyway
2011-03-21T03:18:31  <Stocha> that hardly make it possible to explore complex possibilities with complex slow to compute rules.
2011-03-21T03:18:34  <antimatroid> that was the previous promised minimum amount
2011-03-21T03:18:41  <antimatroid> they aren't that slow

2011-03-21T03:26:33  <_flag> Why aren't the scores based on the number of ants a player has?
2011-03-21T03:28:05  <janzert> there isn't an incentive to kill off your opponent, just keep him beat down below you
2011-03-21T03:28:21  *** sigh <sigh!~sigh@145.115-50-210.dynamic.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-21T03:28:28  <janzert> I'm not a big fan of the current system though either ;)
2011-03-21T03:28:41  <_flag> Why not a ratio of your total ants to his?
2011-03-21T03:28:50  <_flag> So that means if you kill him your ratio will be higher
2011-03-21T03:29:06  <_flag> The fact that blue won that game is obviously kind of silly
2011-03-21T03:29:59  <janzert> I'd still like it to just be inverse order of elimination, but most seem to be strongly against that
2011-03-21T03:30:41  <_flag> That would work too, in fact it might be even better because it doesn't encourage any kind of playstyle. If you win you win.
2011-03-21T03:30:51  <janzert> yep
2011-03-21T03:31:11  <antimatroid> look at the game, blue was involved in a lot more fights
2011-03-21T03:31:24  <antimatroid> i'm curious what the total number of ants was to each player
2011-03-21T03:31:33  <antimatroid> regardless, green was about to kick its ass
2011-03-21T03:31:44  <_flag> Is there not an ant counter at the top for you?
2011-03-21T03:31:50  <janzert> yep, that's the point green is pretty clearly ahead
2011-03-21T03:31:56  <antimatroid> it's a current ant counter
2011-03-21T03:31:58  <antimatroid> not aggregate
2011-03-21T03:32:37  <janzert> at best I think blue should have tied, since it did survive to the end of the game
2011-03-21T03:32:59  <_flag> Well most kills are a 1:1 thing, so green would be approximately 147 + 83 and blue would be 79 + 91
2011-03-21T03:33:17  <antimatroid> janzert: the game was 100 turns, i expect to have much longer games
2011-03-21T03:33:34  <antimatroid> like, i'd start at max 1000 turns
2011-03-21T03:33:36  <antimatroid> and see how that goes
2011-03-21T03:33:56  <janzert> yes, longer games will help but I'm not sure will eliminate the problem
2011-03-21T03:34:10  <_flag> This senerio could happen with longer games too. Not as much, but it could still happen.
2011-03-21T03:34:19  <antimatroid> Frontier: can we get  a 1000 turn version of that game? :P
2011-03-21T03:34:31  <antimatroid> it happened with planet wars
2011-03-21T03:34:43  <antimatroid> i saw numerous games of mine on tcp where the result would have changed given more time
2011-03-21T03:34:50  <janzert> right so we should learn from that :)
2011-03-21T03:34:55  <antimatroid> what?
2011-03-21T03:35:15  <antimatroid> i mentioned it during planet wars and was keen on a longer match time, and people were pretty unanimous in saying it doesn't really matter
2011-03-21T03:35:34  <janzert> no matter where you cut the game off at there will be the same problems some of the time
2011-03-21T03:35:36  <antimatroid> provided it's as rare as it was for planet wars
2011-03-21T03:35:37  <_flag> In planetwars having more ships was directly correlated to winning. In this having more kills is not as important as having more ants.
2011-03-21T03:35:53  <janzert> I wanted ties if both survived to the end in planetwars too
2011-03-21T03:36:02  <antimatroid> _flag: there is also a food bonus that hasn't been implemented
2011-03-21T03:36:04  <janzert> but felt it was too late to change by the time I realized it
2011-03-21T03:37:05  <antimatroid> if an ant is the last remaining player for a game ending before maxTurns, that player gets a point for every food square that is on the board or would have spawned and every enemy ant that's on the board from a crashed bot
2011-03-21T03:37:29  <antimatroid> so really, we just need to pick maxTurns so that games can reasonably play out and i don't think it'll be much of a problme
2011-03-21T03:37:53  <antimatroid> although we do need to see some examples of the scoring, but that will always be the case until we can test stuff fully
2011-03-21T03:39:21  <_flag> What if we have a scenario where two bots are fighting and killing each other off, and a third bot builds up ants "wins". Would that person still lose if they had less kills and the food bonus wasn't enough?
2011-03-21T03:40:07  <_flag> It seems silly to me to rank bots on anything other than either who won, or who was most likely to win
2011-03-21T03:40:51  <janzert> the food bonus was supposed to be large enough to ensure the third wins but I'm not sure if it really is
2011-03-21T03:41:27  <janzert> and yeah, I really like inverse elimination better
2011-03-21T03:41:50  <_flag> So basically we have to try to create an algorithm that immitates inverse elimination without actually being inverse elimination?
2011-03-21T03:42:26  <janzert> that's as much as I could talk people into :P
2011-03-21T03:42:32  <_flag> :P

2011-03-21T05:14:01  <Stocha> Hello there.
2011-03-21T05:14:23  <Stocha> I have been thinking about this game, and how to sort through all the ideas.
2011-03-21T05:15:03  <Stocha> I think testing is clearly needed. With different sets of rules. The most basic ones. And some more twisted one. Comparing how bots do in the different environnement.
2011-03-21T05:15:16  <Stocha> Obviously you need bots in order to test. That's quite a problem :)
2011-03-21T05:15:46  <Stocha> Anyway what strikes me right now, is the need to some TCP servers, each with a different game engine
2011-03-21T05:16:01  <Stocha> So that people could start to put bot on.
2011-03-21T05:16:15  <Stocha> And the design team would have lot's of data te chew upon.
2011-03-21T05:17:19  <Stocha> You would need some machine for keeping the differents servers opens.
2011-03-21T05:18:18  <Stocha> I really see no way out of this.
2011-03-21T05:18:29  <Stocha> As far as my testing goes, i have several thing to say.
2011-03-21T05:19:03  <Stocha> First i really think rule "ant dies on same square" needs further testing before being discarded. I mean who really tryed to build a good bot with this rule on ?
2011-03-21T05:19:47  <Stocha> Second, i think it is far too soon to say this game should be multiplayer.
2011-03-21T05:20:06  <Stocha> In my testing, multiple bots fighting doesn't bring much to the table.
2011-03-21T05:20:34  <Stocha> I really see no urgent improvement to the bots engine that would take the multiplayer parameter into account.
2011-03-21T05:20:41  <Stocha> It's just you and some ennemy ants.
2011-03-21T05:21:33  <Stocha> that the ennemy is in fact splitted in 3 others teams, is of no concern to the Ai of the bot at the moment. I really see nothing i can use the ennemy ant ownership information for.

2011-03-21T05:21:57  <antimatroid> stocha: other fighting rules encourage cooperation
2011-03-21T05:22:06  <sigh> someone logged an issue on github because one of my comments was wrong
2011-03-21T05:22:14  <antimatroid> consider this situation : ....a..b..c......
2011-03-21T05:22:16  <Stocha> i think you are going a bit far on this one :)
2011-03-21T05:22:38  <antimatroid> with option 1 and sighs new rule, a and c kill b
2011-03-21T05:22:55  <Stocha> What is certain, is that we need a tcp server, in order to put on some reasonable bots. Like my ExplorerBot, and some other's
2011-03-21T05:23:12  <antimatroid> there will be a tcp server, we just haven't got everything ready enough yet
2011-03-21T05:23:15  <Stocha> So if you agree on this, i can help you with this particular goal.
2011-03-21T05:23:34  <antimatroid> although we shouldn't be that far off? sigh?
2011-03-21T05:23:38  <Stocha> Which i feel is quite urgent :p
2011-03-21T05:23:54  <sigh> antimatroid: no idea, all I know about is the engine
2011-03-21T05:24:05  <antimatroid> testing parameters has always been a necessary part of getting the game ready
2011-03-21T05:24:23  <antimatroid> it's also not really possible until most other things are ready, which is not the case, it's not a case of saying oh that's important, we'll do that first
2011-03-21T05:24:26  <Stocha> I'm very comfortable with java, and quite uncomfortable with pretty much anything else. but if need be, i can try python or anything you like. Only it will takes ages for me to do anything useful :p
2011-03-21T05:24:41  <antimatroid> i have only ever touched python for this
2011-03-21T05:24:52  <antimatroid> although java is rank :P
2011-03-21T05:25:08  <Stocha> what others things might be more important than a tcp server in order to settle the rules a bit ?
2011-03-21T05:25:29  <antimatroid> having working components that allow a tcp server to even work?
2011-03-21T05:25:30  <Stocha> I mean isn't the spec of the game very important for the challenge ?
2011-03-21T05:25:41  <Stocha> What components are lacking ?
2011-03-21T05:25:54  <Stocha> I think you have some game engine.
2011-03-21T05:26:02  <antimatroid> you might be able to knock up a quick visualiser without worrying about all the server stuff etc. but there's a surprising amount of work, along with ranking bots, etc.
2011-03-21T05:26:26  <Stocha> ranking bot in a true sense might be something.
2011-03-21T05:26:36  <Stocha> but you also can do some very rough ranking to start with.
2011-03-21T05:26:38  <antimatroid> not possible to "perfectly" rank bots
2011-03-21T05:26:50  <Stocha> I'm all for simplicity while testing. At least at first.
2011-03-21T05:27:05  <Stocha> it is possible to produce the raw score data for each game.
2011-03-21T05:27:13  <Stocha> how is that far for perfection ?
2011-03-21T05:27:32  <Stocha> anyone can dig through the data and make his mind. untile we got something to compute this data.

2011-03-21T05:31:04  <Stocha> For example, let's say that i come with some engine with some tcp capabilities for submiting bots, and a tcp starting pack. Would someone be able to get a machine to run the server ?

2011-03-21T05:31:25  <antimatroid> no
2011-03-21T05:31:46  <Stocha> who's in charge when he is not there then ?
2011-03-21T05:31:59  <Stocha> how do things works when he is not there ?

2011-03-21T05:33:02  <Stocha> for the challenge.
2011-03-21T05:33:11  <Stocha> the tasks list
2011-03-21T05:33:18  <antimatroid> on the wiki i'm pretty sure
2011-03-21T05:33:35  <Stocha> i should have a look at that then.
2011-03-21T05:38:44  <Stocha> I looked into it (i think). I see nothing about sorting out rules.
2011-03-21T05:39:15  <Stocha> That kinda worry me :p
2011-03-21T05:39:51  <Stocha> I see some task for starte pack. but nothing about the GameEngine(s) implementation tasks
2011-03-21T05:40:59  <Stocha> Most tasks refers to stuff that i don't really know what they are about at this point. The only thing clear to met being that their is a set of games (with different rules features) that will be sorted down to one game (with one set of feature) that people will try to make bot for.
2011-03-21T05:41:11  <antimatroid> it's on to the "to do" list, we're just not to the stage that we feel ready to do it
2011-03-21T05:41:37  <Stocha> But i have heard of launching the stuff in like a week ?
2011-03-21T05:41:49  <antimatroid> some people are kidding themselves
2011-03-21T05:41:54  <Stocha> it seems more like a few 6 month right now.
2011-03-21T05:42:20  <Stocha> So let's say we are still in the prototyping phase.
2011-03-21T05:42:43  <antimatroid> it should me live within i month, i hope
2011-03-21T05:42:46  <antimatroid> be*
2011-03-21T05:43:06  <Stocha> Wouldn't it be usefull to have a quick dirty way of making (strong)bot play one another on different sort of rules ?
2011-03-21T05:43:49  <antimatroid> the engine can run pretty much all rules
2011-03-21T05:43:59  <antimatroid> once everything is set up including a tcp server, we will test them
2011-03-21T05:44:04  <Stocha> so that we can see more clearly out what a "good" set of rules will be. And also some people would have fun making some bot, and exploring the different set-features constraints
2011-03-21T05:44:14  <antimatroid> that's precisely why there's so many unknowns, we haven't got stuff to a testable point
2011-03-21T05:44:36  <Stocha> but i have seen bots playing one another yet.
2011-03-21T05:44:47  <Stocha> in thoses visualizer showcases.
2011-03-21T05:45:05  <antimatroid> yes, but there is more to it than just that to actually test bots against each other with rankings etc.

2011-03-21T12:50:49  <slkjcna> Hello chaps! It seems like you're running a pretty interesting challenge... Do you think it's plausible that an okay programmer with no previous AI experience but plenty of time could take part convincingly?
2011-03-21T12:51:23  <amstan> slkjcna: you should do fine
2011-03-21T12:51:32  <caution> you won't win though
2011-03-21T12:51:53  <Naktibalda> only 1 can win
2011-03-21T12:52:07  <amstan> well.. i won rps with no previous AI experience before, but there were 120 contestants at the time
2011-03-21T12:52:49  <slkjcna> caution: I didn't expect to.
2011-03-21T12:52:59  <caution> I was joking
2011-03-21T12:53:29  <slkjcna> Don't worry about it
2011-03-21T12:55:11  <slkjcna> amstan: Thanks! Are there any useful resources beyond the wiki/github/forum/IRC?
2011-03-21T12:55:30  <amstan> slkjcna: nope.. that's pretty much it, lol
2011-03-21T12:56:29  <slkjcna> No "beginner's guide to AI"?
2011-03-21T12:57:58  <Gorgoroth> hi guys, i've been thinking a minor tweak to the core gameplay, how about bringing food back to the nest before gaining another ant ?

2011-03-21T13:00:47  <slkjcna> dwchandler: So I gathered, but are all of them relevant?
2011-03-21T13:00:55  <Naktibalda> no
2011-03-21T13:01:06  <slkjcna> Oh, dear.
2011-03-21T13:01:14  <dwchandler> the tricky part is figuring out *which* bits are relevant ;-)
2011-03-21T13:01:37  <dwchandler> keep reading the forums as things get going and people will talk about approaches
2011-03-21T13:01:45  <slkjcna> I'd better get to it, then. Thanks all.
2011-03-21T13:01:46  <dwchandler> then you can go search
2011-03-21T13:01:54  <UncleVasya> slkjcna: my entry for previous contest was my first  real program. Before this were only the simple tasks in my technical school (like find average of 1-metric array of integers or find sum of elements on main diagonal of an array). I downloaded starter package for contest and there were sources of few sample bots with different tactics.
2011-03-21T13:02:41  <slkjcna> UncleVasya: That's encouraging. Great!
2011-03-21T13:02:47  <UncleVasya> I have no computer science or even good mathematician background. But string by string I implemented my ideas to the bot.
2011-03-21T13:03:15  <slkjcna> Looks like there's hope yet...
2011-03-21T13:03:47  <UncleVasya> And it became smarter. So I didn't use even any of game theory elements, just scripting.
2011-03-21T13:03:48  <caution> did you rank in the top 50%?
2011-03-21T13:03:58  <UncleVasya> My place is 313.
2011-03-21T13:04:48  <amstan> Gorgoroth: if you wanna play with the specs you have to nag antimatroid
2011-03-21T13:04:53  <UncleVasya> But it needed really many time and to the end of contest I was wery tired :)
2011-03-21T13:04:57  <amstan> Gorgoroth: and mcleopold
2011-03-21T13:05:19  <UncleVasya> *a lot of time
2011-03-21T13:05:27  <slkjcna> UncleVasya: Good thing I've got plenty of time on my hands.

2011-03-21T13:06:46  <UncleVasya> But I think this time contest auditory will be much stronger and we'll need to implement game theory to stand even in top500.

2011-03-21T18:03:08  <anders__> Hello, I wonder if I would like to set up a new contest amongst friends for the Planet Wars game, is it possible to do so using the stuff at github (server, sandbox, starter kits and so on) ?

2011-03-21T18:06:13  <anders__> We'd like to play the Planet Wars game
2011-03-21T18:07:00  <anders__> and have people with different programming skills (read Java vs .NET guys) try to beat eachother in their favourite programming language
2011-03-21T18:07:30  <anders__> Planet wars with the relation to Galcon reference seems more fun than the ant thing
2011-03-21T18:08:03  <anders__> it seems the official ai-contest is closed so I thought we need to set up our own contest server somehow
2011-03-21T18:09:37  <anders__> perhaps there is some other public contest server we could join ?
2011-03-21T18:10:20  <jeff____> I think some people have set up their own instances, but I don't think any are active right now.

2011-03-21T18:11:10  <anders__> ok
2011-03-21T18:11:12  <j3camero> If you have some experience setting up web servers and such, you will probably be able to figure it out.
2011-03-21T18:11:26  <j3camero> But perhaps all you want is the game engine itself.
2011-03-21T18:11:49  <dwchandler> anders__: see http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars.html
2011-03-21T18:11:52  <j3camero> For example, if you and a group of trusted friends want to run your programs against each other, you could use the game engine to do that.
2011-03-21T18:11:57  <anders__> I know Java stuff and SQL, but very litlle Python which seems to be all over the project

2011-03-21T18:12:24  <j3camero> dwchandler: is the TCP server for planet wars still running?
2011-03-21T18:12:49  <dwchandler> no, but the server code tar.gz is linked on that page
2011-03-21T18:13:01  <dwchandler> I had it running on my server for a bit
2011-03-21T18:17:22  <dwchandler> planet wars was hella fun. it might be worth reviving a tcp server if anyone cares
2011-03-21T18:17:28  <sigh> amstan/McLeopold1: which one of you should I talk to about the directory structure of the ants/ directory?
2011-03-21T18:17:34  <McLeopold1> me
2011-03-21T18:18:14  <sigh> McLeopold1: I made a script to check battle resolution (ants/battle_sim.py), where should it live?
2011-03-21T18:18:27  <McLeopold1> like a unit test?
2011-03-21T18:18:43  <sigh> no, it's more for helping people decide between the battle options :P
2011-03-21T18:19:30  <McLeopold1> does it run test games?
2011-03-21T18:19:30  <sigh> it's just a tool, it takes an initial positon on STDIN and simulates a battle on it under each attack option
2011-03-21T18:19:59  <sigh> no, not really
2011-03-21T18:20:28  <McLeopold1> the main directory for now
2011-03-21T18:20:44  <sigh> ok, no worries
2011-03-21T18:21:01  <McLeopold1> if we get unit tests, maybe a test directory would be good
2011-03-21T18:21:35  <sigh> yeah, this can act as a unit test for the attack options
2011-03-21T18:22:07  <McLeopold1> looking at the dir, that "map.py" file ought to go
2011-03-21T18:22:11  <anders__> dwchandler: so AIs that we develop out of starter kits could connect directly to the server engine found in the source code?
2011-03-21T18:22:55  <McLeopold1> anders__: do you care if the server compiles, or do you just want a quick and dirty way to get a leaderboard?
2011-03-21T18:24:30  <anders__> well I guess we would like to both have an "arena" where the battles happen and a leaderboard yes
2011-03-21T18:25:22  <McLeopold1> a tcp server would allow bots to connect and play, but it wouldn't schedule the games, and the bots would have to run on their own machines
2011-03-21T18:25:38  <McLeopold1> If you're okay with that, then that would be easier to setup.
2011-03-21T18:25:39  <dwchandler> anders__: the starter kits don't do TCP, so on that same page I linked there's a tcp.c app that passes the I/O to the server
2011-03-21T18:26:14  <dwchandler> the tcp server had very basic Elo matching if there were choices available, iirc
2011-03-21T18:26:36  <McLeopold1> dwchandler: actually it had first 2 in get matched logic
2011-03-21T18:26:39  <dwchandler> but any two free connections would get matched up
2011-03-21T18:26:42  <anders__> ah ok, so that's what the "tournament" thing on github is taking care of ... the game schedule
2011-03-21T18:27:04  <McLeopold1> right, otherwise you just get some random matchups
2011-03-21T18:27:05  <dwchandler> McLeopold1: I thought daniel added a bit of wait and Elo match
2011-03-21T18:27:26  <McLeopold1> there was elo match, but it only every allowed 1 in the queue :)
2011-03-21T18:28:03  <dwchandler> it was fine for testing bots
2011-03-21T18:29:29  <j3camero> So McLeopold1, how are things? Did you see that the github project was on the Reddit front page yesterday?
2011-03-21T18:30:47  <McLeopold1> j3camero: yes I did.  we have a to do list going on an etherpad, which was easier for me to do that github issues
2011-03-21T18:31:14  <McLeopold1> http://ietherpad.com/sMmBH9htlr
2011-03-21T18:31:24  <j3camero> Love the etherpad.
2011-03-21T18:31:30  <twinshadow> I just noticed the LOLcode bot.
2011-03-21T18:31:35  <anders__> well, thanks for guidance, I will think a bit on what to do next... perhaps it fun enough to play random games againts eachother, I guess you will soon see who's master of universe (our universe that is... ) :)
2011-03-21T18:31:53  <McLeopold1> anders__: tcp.zeroviz.us, I'll get it running shortly for you, so you can play.
2011-03-21T18:31:59  <j3camero> McLeopold1: oh snap are we using chroot to jail the users?
2011-03-21T18:32:15  <McLeopold1> j3camero: janzert might do it...
2011-03-21T18:32:28  <j3camero> Oh nice nice.
2011-03-21T18:32:33  <McLeopold1> that's one of the big todo's left
2011-03-21T18:32:38  <j3camero> We overworked poor janzert last time.
2011-03-21T18:33:00  <anders__> McL : oh how nice!
2011-03-21T18:33:03  <j3camero> Yes security has always been the toughest nut to crack. Once we get past that, things will start to fall into place very rapidly.
2011-03-21T18:33:04  <McLeopold1> The other one is the true skill rankings.  I honestly think I'll have that working this week.
2011-03-21T18:33:22  <McLeopold1> sigh has taken over engine issues

Things gets real really fast as launch approaches, and the workload can turn into 36 hours per day. But it sounds like you're really stepping up into a leadership role, which is great to see!

2011-03-21T18:37:01  <sigh> McLeopold1: someone opened an issue because one of my comments was wrong...
2011-03-21T18:40:13  <McLeopold1> I saw.  Looks like you're a bad coder. :D
2011-03-21T18:40:40  <McLeopold1> anders__: the tcp server is running and you can play the contest winner when you connect
2011-03-21T18:40:43  <sigh> well, I already knew that :P
2011-03-21T18:41:06  <anders__> McLeopold1: we'll start looking at setting up starter kits and then we'll  try to connect to your server
2011-03-21T18:47:15  *** McLeopold1 <McLeopold1!~Scott@barracuda.imagesourceinc.com> has left #aichallenge
2011-03-21T18:48:20  <j3camero> McLeopold1: how easy do you think it's going to be to launch an end-to-end contest instance this time? Is there any script such that I can fire up a VM and run "wget some_script.sh; ./some_script.sh" and have a working contest instance?
2011-03-21T18:49:13  <j3camero> Not the first priority obviously, but it would be great if any one of those 170 people watching the repo could light up their own instance. I bet we would get lots more contributors.
2011-03-21T18:52:09  <janzert> I don't think you can set up a working instance even doing it manually yet ;)
2011-03-21T18:52:12  <Zannick> i keep seeing new issues get opened that are comments on old issues...
2011-03-21T18:52:29  <janzert> but there is a server_setup.py script that will configure as much of a main server as I think is possible so far
2011-03-21T18:53:04  <janzert> and a worker_setup.py script that does the same for a worker, but is still basically trying to setup a planetwars worker

2011-03-21T19:16:55  <antimatroid> lol
2011-03-21T19:16:55  <amstan> sigh: lol
2011-03-21T19:17:07  <sigh> yeah...
2011-03-21T19:17:14  <antimatroid> from comments on reddit, it would appear option 1 is out
2011-03-21T19:17:21  <amstan> antimatroid: why? lol
2011-03-21T19:17:26  <antimatroid> people just don't get it
2011-03-21T19:17:40  <amstan> well.. i don't get it either actually..
2011-03-21T19:17:44  <antimatroid> but we have a more intuitive close relative, so i'm on board for it
2011-03-21T19:17:52  <antimatroid> amstan: it's quite simple once you understand it
2011-03-21T19:17:57  <sigh> haha
2011-03-21T19:18:06  <amstan> antimatroid: tip: stop calling it option 1
2011-03-21T19:18:09  <amstan> it's not semantic at all
2011-03-21T19:18:24  <antimatroid> power option then
2011-03-21T19:18:36  <antimatroid> amstan: your power = 1/#enemiesinrange
2011-03-21T19:18:48  <amstan> seems rather weird
2011-03-21T19:18:54  <antimatroid> you live if you have power > power for all enemies in range
2011-03-21T19:19:20  <amstan> i find this hilarious "j3camero: My mom submitted an entry in the last contest. I kid you not. You will be fine, trust me. :-)"
2011-03-21T19:19:26  <amstan> antimatroid: what's the range?
2011-03-21T19:19:33  <sigh> attackradius
2011-03-21T19:19:33  <antimatroid> atm sqrt(5)
2011-03-21T19:19:38  <sigh> 6
2011-03-21T19:19:45  <antimatroid> 6?
2011-03-21T19:19:48  <amstan> antimatroid: so.. what about the other options?
2011-03-21T19:19:52  <antimatroid> oh, sqrt(6)
2011-03-21T19:20:31  <antimatroid> sighs new method i like most now: each ant hast 1 damage to pass out each turn, distrbuted evenly amongst its enemies (so 1/#enemiesinrange to each enemy), then an ant with >=1 damage dies
2011-03-21T19:21:18  <antimatroid> the other main option is the "iteratively remove the enemy ants that are closest" which doesn't really offer much in the way of cooperation and has weird situations like a..b..a where both a's die with the b
2011-03-21T19:21:34  <antimatroid> with sigh's option, a..b..a and a..b..c (cooperation!) kill just b
2011-03-21T19:22:05  <antimatroid> i believe the cooperation i speak of is a result of the battle option reflecting the number of enemy ants your enemies in range have
2011-03-21T19:22:10  <sigh> this should be written up somewhere, with examples
2011-03-21T19:22:23  <antimatroid> sigh: i'll do that today
2011-03-21T19:23:04  <sigh> antimatroid: I suggest creating a new wiki page, and link the specs page to that... no point listing options on the specs page until it is finalised
2011-03-21T19:23:13  <antimatroid> yeah, that's the plan
2011-03-21T19:23:29  <antimatroid> i suspect we'll need to break the specs page up like that anyway
2011-03-21T19:23:34  <antimatroid> it's going to be huge otherwise
2011-03-21T19:23:37  <sigh> antimatroid: also, see the comments in the code for reasonable descriptions of the current options
2011-03-21T19:23:43  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-21T19:23:57  <sigh> don't raise any issues if they are wrong :)
2011-03-21T19:24:06  <antimatroid> but...

2011-03-21T19:24:41  <sigh> antimatroid: nah, the final specs should be on the one page
2011-03-21T19:25:04  <antimatroid> sigh: i was thinking maybe briefer explanations then a link to more detailed?
2011-03-21T19:25:08  <sigh> if anything, you could link elsewhere for more detail (e.g. examples of gaem replays, battle resolutions or whatever)
2011-03-21T19:25:10  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-21T19:25:19  <antimatroid> so then the battle resolution can have example images, same with map files etc.
2011-03-21T19:25:41  <sigh> sure, but I think you should be able to go to one page for a complete specs
2011-03-21T19:25:55  <sigh> other pages are just for examples and so on
2011-03-21T19:26:41  <antimatroid> what options am i considering?
2011-03-21T19:26:44  <antimatroid> there's like 4 now?
2011-03-21T19:26:54  <antimatroid> should i throw out power and friends/enemies?
2011-03-21T19:26:54  <sigh> there's four in the code, yeah
2011-03-21T19:27:09  <antimatroid> i think it's really out of option 2 and 4
2011-03-21T19:27:10  <sigh> you decide
2011-03-21T19:27:34  <sigh> it's easy enough to generate examples for all four with the battle_sim.py script

2011-03-21T19:30:37  <nicklovescode> interested in the ants challenge, is it ready for me to start developing and testing a bot or should I wait some more
2011-03-21T19:30:39  <nicklovescode> (python)
2011-03-21T19:31:05  <antimatroid> nicklovescode: i would suggest you wait a few weeks
2011-03-21T19:31:12  <antimatroid> you will have plenty of time for programming i promise
2011-03-21T19:31:36  <antimatroid> (the contest will go for ~ 2 months i think)
2011-03-21T19:31:42  <nicklovescode> ah, ok cool
2011-03-21T19:31:59  <amstan> nicklovescode: you could start.. but there's no guarantee that things might not change
2011-03-21T19:32:14  <amstan> nicklovescode: so if you do start, and things do change, don't get mad
2011-03-21T19:32:27  <amstan> nicklovescode: also.. you won't be able to submit anything since the server won't be up
2011-03-21T19:32:35  <antimatroid> aka start thinking about strategies, but coding could be frustrating
2011-03-21T19:32:49  <amstan> antimatroid: well.. no, we already have starter packages
2011-03-21T19:32:52  <nicklovescode> but is there anyway to see how my bot compares to others?
2011-03-21T19:33:05  <amstan> nicklovescode: at this point there is no other bots, afaik
2011-03-21T19:33:14  <antimatroid> amstan: sure, but dependent on the rules chosen, how you structure it beyond that might become annoying/not the best way
2011-03-21T19:33:14  <amstan> nicklovescode: just the sample ones
2011-03-21T19:33:20  <amstan> antimatroid: yeah
2011-03-21T19:33:25  <antimatroid> amstna: there is hunterbot
2011-03-21T19:33:31  <amstan> antimatroid: those has to be finalized soon
2011-03-21T19:33:37  <antimatroid> nicklovescode: try playing agains the python hunterbot
2011-03-21T19:33:40  <amstan> antimatroid: we can't leave them hanging till just before launching
2011-03-21T19:33:54  <nicklovescode> I have it git cloned and I'm in that directory, how do I get it running?
2011-03-21T19:34:07  <amstan> antimatroid: how's the wiki btw? How finalized are things in there?
2011-03-21T19:34:09  <antimatroid> nicklovescode: what os?
2011-03-21T19:34:13  <nicklovescode> OSX

2011-03-21T19:34:27  <antimatroid> amstan: i'll give stuff a clean today, i haven't touched it in a while

2011-03-21T19:37:56  <sigh> nicklovescode: if you look at ants/play_one_game.sh you can see how to run a game

2011-03-21T19:38:22  <antimatroid> nicklovescode: bear in mind getting stuff running should be a lot simpler in a couple of weeks
2011-03-21T19:38:36  <antimatroid> so if you can't get it running now, don't give up and assume you wont be able to when we launch officially
2011-03-21T19:39:55  <sigh> either way, running stuff on osx should be the same as linux for this stuff, so anyone should be able to help you

2011-03-21T19:51:22  <antimatroid> For each ant \(a\) with \(n > 0 \) enemies within the attack radius, define their power to be \(power(a) = \frac{1}{n}\). An ant lives if it has no enemies or a greater power than all its enemies within the attack radius.

2011-03-21T19:53:47  <McLeopold1> consider all the stuff in ants/bots to be example bots
2011-03-21T19:54:03  <amstan> McLeopold1: most of those forks are for starter packages
2011-03-21T19:54:32  <McLeopold1> we control the starter packages, so we just contact who we need to
2011-03-21T19:54:41  <antimatroid> with conflicts option 2 doesn't really need to be an iterative thing
2011-03-21T19:54:49  <antimatroid> closest option**
2011-03-21T19:55:25  <janzert> antimatroid: the general style is fine with me, I'd get rid of the redundant "no enemies or" in the second sentence though
2011-03-21T19:55:44  <antimatroid> janzert: it's not redundent :P
2011-03-21T19:55:56  <Stocha> I have set up two applets with my bots running on. On for dieOnSameSquare. and why for rule1fighting
2011-03-21T19:56:00  <janzert> the first sentence already says you only do the test if enemies are in range
2011-03-21T19:56:13  <Stocha> So you can view them at home. Alos it's far from comfotable at the moment :p
2011-03-21T19:56:23  <antimatroid> no, it says i only define power for those ants with ants in range
2011-03-21T19:56:24  <janzert> and it make the second one harder to mentally parse with it there
2011-03-21T19:56:24  <amstan> oh man.. sbcl is 53MB
2011-03-21T19:56:30  <Stocha> rough prototype stuff
2011-03-21T19:57:16  <McLeopold1> amstan: let's move bots to example_bots and create a new dir starter_bots
2011-03-21T19:57:18  <antimatroid> it does make the second one harder to pass, but otherwise it's not perfectly clear :\
2011-03-21T19:57:28  <Stocha> here is the first url http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Rule1Fight/
2011-03-21T19:57:45  <amstan> McLeopold1: they're not example bots though, they're starter bots
2011-03-21T19:57:54  <antimatroid> i couldn't work out how better to phrase it without leaving something potentially unclear (even though it's pretty obvious that an ant with no enemies in range wouldn't die)
2011-03-21T19:57:59  <McLeopold1> amstan: I can move out my python and java starters to new repos that can then be submodules
2011-03-21T19:58:14  <Stocha> here is the other one : http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/DieOnSameSquare/
2011-03-21T19:58:16  <antimatroid> i want to touch my c++ bot again before that's sent off
2011-03-21T19:58:16  <McLeopold1> amstan: they are what every we call them :)
2011-03-21T19:58:19  <antimatroid> when do i need to do that by?
2011-03-21T19:58:30  <amstan> McLeopold1: i don't want to disturb the workflow of about 6 outside commiters
2011-03-21T19:58:37  <Stocha> The bots ranking is kinda reverse between the two rules :p
2011-03-21T19:59:26  <antimatroid> Stocha: that actually doesn't surprise me that much when i think about it
2011-03-21T19:59:33  <Stocha> here the result for fighting1 : http://ns368394.ovh.net/stocha/Rule1Fight/result.txt
2011-03-21T19:59:35  <antimatroid> consider the a..b..a sitation yet again
2011-03-21T19:59:39  <McLeopold1> amstan: It's a simple request.  Please create a brand new repo if you are in charge of a starter bot, we will link it in.
2011-03-21T19:59:49  <Stocha> the other result is P0 winning most of the games.
2011-03-21T20:00:05  <Stocha> and P4 loosing most of them. Although the file is not accessible at the moment
2011-03-21T20:00:17  <antimatroid> i imagine it's a matter of the difference between wanting to send more/less ants into a fight for the two options and reversing who gets points there, not necessarily meaning the game is going to cause the worse bot to lose under a certain rule
2011-03-21T20:00:36  <janzert> so I would make it "For each ant \(a\) with \(n > 0\) enemies within the attack radius: define their power to be \(power(a) = \frac{1}{n}\). The ant lives if it has a greater power than all its enemies within the attack radius."
2011-03-21T20:00:49  <amstan> McLeopold1: how do you envision this then? a bunch of smaller repos, one per language?
2011-03-21T20:01:12  <antimatroid> janzert: you haven't specified what power is for an ant with no enemies
2011-03-21T20:01:16  <antimatroid> i can define that to be 1?
2011-03-21T20:01:17  <McLeopold1> yes, that's what I was thinking?  you were concerned about forks of the whole thing just to make a starter?
2011-03-21T20:01:18  <antimatroid> then it works
2011-03-21T20:01:19  <Stocha> I only count the number of ants also. But the fighting rule is enougth to make quite a few difference : if you stick together you have a great advantage with Fighting1 (at least in my implementation wich may be wrong)
2011-03-21T20:01:33  <amstan> McLeopold1: oh, no.. forking is not the problem
2011-03-21T20:01:43  <amstan> McLeopold1: it's me moving stuff right now, when there's forks in progress
2011-03-21T20:01:52  <antimatroid> oh wait, nevermind
2011-03-21T20:01:55  <antimatroid> okay i'll do that
2011-03-21T20:01:57  <McLeopold1> but don't they just pull and it all works?
2011-03-21T20:02:09  * antimatroid had a logic fail
2011-03-21T20:02:24  <janzert> antimatroid: this is still english, people should be able to know that the power is the same as just defined ;)
2011-03-21T20:02:25  <amstan> no, because git doesn't track folders, see this: http://pastebin.com/kdt2zQ5P
2011-03-21T20:02:36  <Stocha> I should probably put on your new rules in the same settings. Would be consistent with Rule1 in this particular case i guess.
2011-03-21T20:02:39  <janzert> even if a compiler couldn't
2011-03-21T20:02:57  <antimatroid> janzert: give me an explanation for the closest option :P
2011-03-21T20:03:17  <McLeopold1> amstan: ok, so then we create an example_bots folder and move stuff over there, but keep bots as the starters?
2011-03-21T20:03:19  <antimatroid> all i have is "iteratively remove the ants that are currently closest together until no enemy ants remain within the attack radius of each other"
2011-03-21T20:03:48  <janzert> I've never thought of or seen one yet :P
2011-03-21T20:03:51  <antimatroid> probably also need to state closest is using the euclidrean metric
2011-03-21T20:04:25  <amstan> McLeopold1: no, i'll just git mv bots starter_bots, then extract the sample bots in python and java and put them somewhere else
2011-03-21T20:04:35  <janzert> yeah, I'd do that outside of the battle resolution are actually (i.e. "All distances are calculated using the eucilidean distance")
2011-03-21T20:04:51  <amstan> McLeopold1: it should be fine.. i was just worrying about merging later, but it's all good
2011-03-21T20:05:04  <janzert> antimatroid: actually there is already a section for that

2011-03-21T20:17:41  <McLeopold1> is the power option the one where an ant spreads it's attack?

2011-03-21T20:18:02  <antimatroid> other than basic arithmetic
2011-03-21T20:18:16  <janzert> power option is what you were calling occupied I believe
2011-03-21T20:18:18  <McLeopold1> yeah, remove the basic math too

2011-03-21T20:20:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i'm stripping out all the variables
2011-03-21T20:20:46  <McLeopold1> Support Option: An ant dies if there are more enemies in its attack radius then friendlies.  An ant counts as it's own friendly, so it always has at least 1.  If the ant collides with an enemy ant, it dies.
2011-03-21T20:21:03  <janzert> for damage option I'd probably just say something like "An ant distributes 1 point of damage evenly among all the enemies within its attack radius. An ant then lives if it receives less than 1 full point of damage in that turn."
2011-03-21T20:21:21  * McLeopold1 nods
2011-03-21T20:22:09  <McLeopold1> antimatroid: with the support option, we will need to detect ants crossing paths, and kill them
2011-03-21T20:23:00  <janzert> maybe at the top say that ants always die if they collide with another ant and leave it out of any of the specific options
2011-03-21T20:23:02  <McLeopold1> but, where do the die?  how do you represent the 'd' lines?
2011-03-21T20:23:32  <antimatroid> try again now..
2011-03-21T20:23:52  <amstan> McLeopold1: https://gist.github.com/880519

2011-03-21T20:23:54  <amstan> McLeopold1: how's that?
2011-03-21T20:23:58  <janzert> McLeopold1: that's a reason I don't like any option that has the potential for ants to "cross paths"
2011-03-21T20:23:59  <antimatroid> it is
2011-03-21T20:24:11  <antimatroid> otherwise people might try to calculate the power of ants without enemies
2011-03-21T20:24:16  <antimatroid> which is /0 error
2011-03-21T20:24:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold1: you can send more than 1 d line for a square, you already are for colliding friends right?
2011-03-21T20:24:57  <janzert> I'd prefer it just said "distributes damage evenly" in the damage option
2011-03-21T20:24:58  <McLeopold1> amstan: the tools will be a separate download, so no
2011-03-21T20:25:06  <antimatroid> it's a pain to process if you don't care about that but do about dead ants from battle

2011-03-21T20:28:34  <antimatroid> :p
2011-03-21T20:28:51  <antimatroid> or.. i could just throw option 1 out now?

2011-03-21T20:31:11  <McLeopold1> do power and damage diverge in any situations?

2011-03-21T20:31:49  <janzert> you could add a note that it's not really being considered anymore though?
2011-03-21T20:32:04  <antimatroid> what setup?
2011-03-21T20:32:10  <antimatroid> i haven't actually done an example
2011-03-21T20:32:15  <antimatroid> but they aren't equivalent
2011-03-21T20:32:16  <McLeopold1> the setup where power and damage have different outcomes
2011-03-21T20:33:17  <antimatroid> hmmm, i'm trying to think of one
2011-03-21T20:34:19  <antimatroid> they;re VERY similar
2011-03-21T20:35:17  <McLeopold1> jmcarthur and I did derive the power method from thinking about how ants would do damage...

2011-03-21T20:38:13  <janzert> I think that differs between power and damage
2011-03-21T20:38:27  <antimatroid> i think you're right
2011-03-21T20:38:46  <antimatroid> oh wait, no?
2011-03-21T20:38:55  <janzert> all a's die in both, but power kills the middle b?
2011-03-21T20:39:08  <antimatroid> oh yeah
2011-03-21T20:39:16  <antimatroid> but each ant distributes 1/3 yeah?
2011-03-21T20:39:17  <antimatroid> damage
2011-03-21T20:39:22  <antimatroid> so one of the b's gets 1 damage
2011-03-21T20:39:24  <antimatroid> killing it
2011-03-21T20:39:51  <janzert> hmm only 3 b's are in range? then I guess not
2011-03-21T20:40:04  <antimatroid> oh, wait yeah
2011-03-21T20:40:17  <antimatroid> but then no b's die with power either?
2011-03-21T20:40:39  <antimatroid> oh yeah, for sqrt(6)  you may be right
2011-03-21T20:40:58  <janzert> I just was going by your first diagram in the forums, but it may be using a smaller radius?

2011-03-21T21:31:03  <antimatroid> i can edit whatever you make, i just have no idea how
2011-03-21T21:31:14  <antimatroid> ideally it would be able to set DEBUG in bug.h
2011-03-21T21:31:16  <amstan> antimatroid: i already have it for cpp, see the second last commit
2011-03-21T21:31:21  <antimatroid> ah, cheers :)
2011-03-21T21:31:22  <amstan> antimatroid: oh! good idea

2011-03-21T21:39:13  <amstan> antimatroid: let's see about that debug thing
2011-03-21T21:40:06  <amstan> antimatroid: the command line flag won't work if you have this in the source: #define DEBUG false
2011-03-21T21:40:21  *** nicklikescode_ <nicklikescode_!~nicklikes@c-98-216-122-137.hsd1.ma.comcast.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-21T21:40:22  <amstan> the #define overrides the switch, i think
2011-03-21T21:40:28  <antimatroid> what if it's const bool DEBUG false?
2011-03-21T21:40:37  <amstan> shouldn't be a const..
2011-03-21T21:40:37  <antimatroid> ;*
2011-03-21T21:40:48  <amstan> then you really can't set it
2011-03-21T21:40:54  <amstan> or let the preprocessor handle it

2011-03-21T21:41:26  <antimatroid> hmm, i dunno then :P
2011-03-21T21:41:49  <amstan> antimatroid: how do i test if it works?
2011-03-21T21:44:41  <antimatroid> just run the program
2011-03-21T21:44:51  <antimatroid> and paste in the sample bot input from the specs page
2011-03-21T21:44:52  <janzert> just leave DEBUG undefined in the source files
2011-03-21T21:45:08  <janzert> protect the DEBUG sections with #ifdef DEBUG
2011-03-21T21:45:19  <antimatroid> janzert: i have it set to false?
2011-03-21T21:45:19  <janzert> and define DEBUG on the command line for debug builds
2011-03-21T21:45:26  <antimatroid> and they're all inline
2011-03-21T21:46:06  <antimatroid> they have a variable in state that they can treat like cin and it all gets stripped when debug is false when compiling
2011-03-21T21:46:28  <janzert> defining it in the source will only allow it to work by physically changing the source

2011-03-21T21:54:34  <antimatroid> but they're damn close
2011-03-21T21:54:38  <sigh> they are similar
2011-03-21T21:54:39  <antimatroid> sigh: give us a counterexample
2011-03-21T21:54:49  <sigh> hang on
2011-03-21T21:55:05  <janzert> seems like they should be different, but every time I try and construct an example to show it they come out the same :/
2011-03-21T21:55:26  <antimatroid> i think we should straight up say no openings of width one of maps
2011-03-21T21:55:53  <sigh> I had counter-examples, when I was testing my battle_sim script
2011-03-21T21:56:03  <antimatroid> consider the following
2011-03-21T21:56:03  <antimatroid> %%%%%%%
2011-03-21T21:56:03  <antimatroid> ........a..a..........

2011-03-21T21:56:33  <janzert> with power or damage resolution
2011-03-21T21:56:52  <antimatroid> anything that allows blocking 1 width corridors has that problem
2011-03-21T21:56:57  <janzert> right
2011-03-21T21:57:43  <sigh> python battle_sim.py <<<"a.a.b|.c.c"
2011-03-21T21:57:54  <sigh> took a few tries :)
2011-03-21T21:58:58  <antimatroid> so it's quite rare?
2011-03-21T21:59:15  <sigh> it's hard to find if you are hunting around randomly, yes
2011-03-21T21:59:18  <sigh> like I was doing
2011-03-21T21:59:38  <sigh> but I know I hit a few last night
2011-03-21T21:59:43  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-03-21T21:59:44  <janzert> also I'm not sure that exact example is possible to get to happen in a game
2011-03-21T21:59:52  <antimatroid> we'll i'm going to make some lunch then make those examples
2011-03-21T22:00:05  <antimatroid> sigh: feel free to tell me anything i miss on this page

2011-03-21T22:03:35  <janzert> how do the c's get so close?

2011-03-21T22:03:57  <contestbot> amstan: Aye, aye, sir
2011-03-21T22:04:26  <janzert> ok, yeah if the a's had taken a step down the b a step left and the c's a step up?
2011-03-21T22:04:34  <sigh> yes, I think so
2011-03-21T22:06:11  <sigh> janzert, don't forget that they could have spawned in the last round
2011-03-21T22:06:21  <sigh> so it opens up more possiblibies
2011-03-21T22:06:38  <janzert> yes, but only if just one other side was in range of the food
2011-03-21T22:06:56  <sigh> yeah, but food radius is only sqrt(2)
2011-03-21T22:07:02  <sigh> much smaller than attack radius
2011-03-21T22:07:24  <janzert> which only makes it harder to have had an effect
2011-03-21T22:07:40  <janzert> since you're more likely to be in the attack radius range?
2011-03-21T22:08:00  <janzert> anyway they certainly differ
2011-03-21T22:08:13  <sigh> no, it means that you can effectively "move" diagonally
2011-03-21T22:08:14  <janzert> and the example given is even possible
2011-03-21T22:08:20  <sigh> because you can spawn on the diagonal
2011-03-21T22:08:55  <sigh> but yeah, this is all tangential :)
2011-03-21T22:09:33  <janzert> I just meant if food radius was sqrt(6) you'd have more likelihood to get positions that couldn't be moved into

2011-03-21T22:12:27  <antimatroid> i think we could take away food deaths?
2011-03-21T22:12:34  <antimatroid> and make food squares block movement
2011-03-21T22:12:53  <antimatroid> or at least allow the bot with the most ants to get the food square first, otherwise kill it

2011-03-21T22:24:52  <sigh> I just went to the page and looked at where things were :P
2011-03-21T22:26:16  <kylem__> sigh: sounds good. couple of follow ups...the initial forum submission says that each ant would run its own code with no centralized controller, but python start bot has a central controller it looks like. does that mean you guys are leaning towards a centrally controlled colony AI?
2011-03-21T22:26:43  <antimatroid> kylen__: your program controls all ants at once
2011-03-21T22:26:54  <antimatroid> we decided it wasn't feasible to do the former while it would have been nice
2011-03-21T22:27:09  <sigh> kylem__: see https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification for latest specs
2011-03-21T22:27:14  <antimatroid> mostly due to the overhead of starting all those processes, particilarly for tcp connections
2011-03-21T22:27:25  <sigh> if you look at the forum you'll see all the ideas that have been thrown around

2011-03-21T22:28:58  <antimatroid> sorry that there aren't examples, i'm working on those now
2011-03-21T22:32:16  <Frontier> lol, wtf
2011-03-21T22:32:55  <sigh> Frontier: someone was complaining about visualizer on safari
2011-03-21T22:33:45  <kylem__> antimatroid: just from the cursory read, i'm partial to the damage option, it is the most intuitive imho
2011-03-21T22:33:49  <Frontier> sigh: o'rly? let me guess: the images didn't load. i hate that bug. nasty, nasty bug. i should drink less
2011-03-21T22:34:10  <sigh> Frontier: not sure what it was, grep logs for safari
2011-03-21T22:34:18  <antimatroid> kylem__: correct answer :)
2011-03-21T22:34:53  <kylem__> antimatroid: iterative seems not very good, especially since it depends on how the game orders the pairs versus the players, so you'd be forced to disclose very detailed specs on how the battle unfolds in order to reproduced in client simulations
2011-03-21T22:35:09  <antimatroid> it doesn't depend on ordering pairs
2011-03-21T22:35:18  <antimatroid> if 3 players are at an equal distance, they all die in the same iteration
2011-03-21T22:35:29  <antimatroid> but that's my least favourite of the rules, always has been
2011-03-21T22:35:30  <kylem__> so ..a..b..c.., who dies?
2011-03-21T22:35:31  <sigh> kylem__: none of the implementations depend on order
2011-03-21T22:35:56  <antimatroid> kylem__: b dies for power and damage, otherwise they all die
2011-03-21T22:35:58  <Frontier> It is Stocha, who has trouble with safari. I was thinking about possible sources for that problem, but i didn't find anything convincing.
2011-03-21T22:36:34  <antimatroid> kylem__: the same can be said for a..b..a :\
2011-03-21T22:36:57  <antimatroid> Frontier: was that with buttons?
2011-03-21T22:36:58  <sigh> antimatroid: with sqrt(6) radius they are too far away to kill each other
2011-03-21T22:37:00  <antimatroid> janzert had that problem
2011-03-21T22:37:11  <antimatroid> sigh: ergh, you know what i mean :P
2011-03-21T22:37:43  <Frontier> a guy from texas told me in an irish pub in hannover, that i was into the girl behind the bar. i said no, but he didn't listen.
2011-03-21T22:38:05  <sigh> o_O
2011-03-21T22:38:21  <CPeng> hey
2011-03-21T22:38:27  <CPeng> i saw a gif somewhere
2011-03-21T22:38:31  <CPeng> of an ant fight
2011-03-21T22:38:32  <Frontier> where do all these people come from that hang around bars at midnight and want to tell people how much their life sucks
2011-03-21T22:38:39  <CPeng> anybody know where it was?
2011-03-21T22:38:51  <amstan> CPeng: forums
2011-03-21T22:38:57  <antimatroid> CPeng: would have been Stocha's posts
2011-03-21T22:39:10  <Frontier> antimatroid: janzert had trouble seeing the buttons below the visualizer
2011-03-21T22:39:27  <kylem__> i see. well, if you end up going with iterative, the way it reads now sounds like 1. pick closest pair of ants 2. kill both 3. if some ants still close goto 1
2011-03-21T22:40:10  <antimatroid> it's that, but pick closest ants, kill all of them, start over
2011-03-21T22:40:27  <antimatroid> i like to think we're not going with that option
2011-03-21T22:41:01  <kylem__> antimatroid: are you concerned about rounding errors in the damage option?
2011-03-21T22:41:11  <antimatroid> no, we'd use rationals
2011-03-21T22:41:30  <Frontier> antimatroid: they dont exist in computers
2011-03-21T22:41:35  <sigh> kylem__: you can see the implementation of all the options in ants/ants.py
2011-03-21T22:41:37  <antimatroid> Frontier: they do if you make them
2011-03-21T22:41:46  <kylem__> sigh: thanks :)
2011-03-21T22:41:52  <antimatroid> integers exist do they not? (at least close enough)
2011-03-21T22:42:05  <sigh> they are the do_attack_* functions
2011-03-21T22:42:41  <sigh> Frontier: what exactly exists in computers, then?
2011-03-21T22:42:55  <Frontier> ok, i get it now. the guinnes (<- good beer) is still makin' my thoughts fuzzy
2011-03-21T22:43:11  <sigh> :P
2011-03-21T22:43:15  <Frontier> sigh: these ieee floating point nnumbers
2011-03-21T22:43:29  <antimatroid> what does it mean to exist?
2011-03-21T22:43:31  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-21T22:43:39  <Frontier> to be or not to be
2011-03-21T22:43:41  <sigh> what does mean?
2011-03-21T22:43:45  <sigh> what does "it" mean?
2011-03-21T22:43:47  <Frontier> who is mean?
2011-03-21T22:43:49  <antimatroid> who was it?
2011-03-21T22:43:54  <sigh> what?
2011-03-21T22:44:08  <Frontier> lol -.-  we crashed the conversation
2011-03-21T22:44:09  <antimatroid> you accidentially missed

2011-03-21T22:44:55  <antimatroid> what? aha
2011-03-21T22:47:29  <kylem__> import fraction, nice
2011-03-21T22:48:13  <antimatroid> fraction? rational would make more sense :\
2011-03-21T22:48:59  <kylem__> antimatroid: are you trolling me?
2011-03-21T22:49:13  <antimatroid> well a fraction could be of many things
2011-03-21T22:49:16  <antimatroid> a rational only ints
2011-03-21T22:49:34  <sigh> rational can be anything too
2011-03-21T22:49:43  <antimatroid> hmmm so it can :P
2011-03-21T22:50:00  <sigh> you can have rational functions
2011-03-21T22:50:14  <antimatroid> yeah, anything with a gcd defined
2011-03-21T22:57:07  <Frontier> i really have to find out what is going wrong with the images on the visualizer. it is difficult to test when everything is local

2011-03-21T23:05:07  <Frontier> amstan: I read your comment on the Makefile, but all I know is that the plugin.jar needs to be on the classpath. That file is in the Sun JRE. My Gentoo linux uses java-config-2 to create a common path to the jre. I don't know what Ubuntu uses. There might be something similar.

2011-03-21T23:17:20  <janzert> btw, a.b.c|.c.. is a slightly simpler example showing difference between power and damage resolutions
2011-03-21T23:22:41  <janzert> actually I guess not really simpler than the example sigh gave, just simpler the example I misremembered as being from him in my playing around :P
2011-03-21T23:23:41  <sigh> janzert: I had an example where the bots where further away from each other: "a.b.c||..c.a"
2011-03-21T23:24:10  <sigh> dunno if you saw that one
2011-03-21T23:24:13  <janzert> nice
2011-03-21T23:24:19  <janzert> no I didn't
2011-03-21T23:24:33  <janzert> was just looking for an example that came out different for all 4 methods
2011-03-21T23:26:00  <janzert> "a.b.c|..c.a|..a"
2011-03-21T23:26:20  <sigh> cool :)
2011-03-21T23:26:22  <janzert> although that one probably really can't occur in a game
2011-03-21T23:26:27  <sigh> yeah :P
2011-03-21T23:28:03  <antimatroid> sigh: what format does my file need to be for battle_sim?
2011-03-21T23:28:18  <janzert> ^^
2011-03-21T23:28:19  <sigh> are you running on linux?
2011-03-21T23:28:22  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-21T23:28:39  <sigh> ./battle_sim.py <<<"a.b.c||..c.a"
2011-03-21T23:28:40  <janzert> "a.b.c|..c.a|..a" is valid input (without quotes)
2011-03-21T23:29:04  <janzert> or replace | with newlines
2011-03-21T23:29:10  <sigh> yup
2011-03-21T23:31:06  <antimatroid> erm.. maybe i'm not passing the file correctly
2011-03-21T23:31:24  <antimatroid> i was doing this "python battle_sim.py << egin.txt"
2011-03-21T23:31:35  <sigh> just <
2011-03-21T23:31:36  <antimatroid> i guess that's probably passing the actual input aye
2011-03-21T23:32:07  <sigh> paste egin.txt?
2011-03-21T23:32:18  <sigh> or just do this if you want it to be inline: python battle_sim.py <<<"a.b.c||..c.a"
2011-03-21T23:32:38  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/Vgn46KQ1
2011-03-21T23:32:44  <antimatroid> doesn't seem to like < syntax
2011-03-21T23:32:49  <antimatroid> just shouts at me
2011-03-21T23:32:56  <sigh> paste error?
2011-03-21T23:33:13  <janzert> or you using one < for the redirect?

2011-03-21T23:33:26  <antimatroid> err, i didn't put it in :P
2011-03-21T23:33:31  <sigh> python battle_sim.py < egin.txt
2011-03-21T23:33:36  <sigh> is what you want
2011-03-21T23:33:45  <antimatroid> oh, nah, same error
2011-03-21T23:33:49  <antimatroid> i just copied the wrong one
2011-03-21T23:34:11  <sigh> invalid syntax... hmm
2011-03-21T23:34:25  <janzert> git status shows no changes to battle_sim.py?
2011-03-21T23:34:46  <antimatroid> dw, it works now
2011-03-21T23:34:49  <antimatroid> it was something i did
2011-03-21T23:34:55  <antimatroid> sorry :P
2011-03-21T23:35:12  <sigh> lol
2011-03-21T23:35:21  <antimatroid> i changed the main function trying to work out what was going on, breaking it in the process :P
2011-03-21T23:35:25  <sigh> was gonna say, there is no 115
2011-03-21T23:35:30  <janzert> :)
2011-03-21T23:35:40  <sigh> btw, you don't need to pad the map
2011-03-21T23:35:49  <sigh> the script makes sure there is no wrarpping
2011-03-21T23:35:53  <sigh> *wrapping
2011-03-21T23:36:22  <amstan> Frontier: ok, i'm back..
2011-03-21T23:36:33  <janzert> "a.b.c||..c.a||.a" (more vertical space added) still works to show a difference with all the methods of resolution, still probably not possible in a game though
2011-03-21T23:36:39  <amstan> Frontier: my $JAVA_HOME is blank
2011-03-21T23:36:53  <amstan> Frontier: is it another package i have to install?
2011-03-21T23:38:58  <antimatroid> sigh: it might be better so people don't get confused
2011-03-21T23:39:15  <sigh> what might be better?
2011-03-21T23:39:23  <antimatroid> to make sure it wouldn't change with wrapping
2011-03-21T23:39:30  <antimatroid> i'll make the examples smaller, that was just a first
2011-03-21T23:39:44  <janzert> for testing battle resolutions I think keeping wrapping off is best
2011-03-21T23:39:47  <antimatroid> actually, i'll just say ignore wrapping for tests
2011-03-21T23:40:05  <antimatroid> yes keeping it off, i was referring to people looking at the examples and going but but...
2011-03-21T23:40:58  <sigh> well, then put some padding in the examples... this script is for people to experiment with the specs :)
2011-03-21T23:42:02  <sigh> hmm... I suppose it is useful even after a method has been settled
2011-03-21T23:42:16  <sigh> for working out tactics
2011-03-21T23:42:55  <amstan> antimatroid: you available?
2011-03-21T23:52:40  <antimatroid> amstan: what for?
2011-03-21T23:52:58  <amstan> antimatroid: well, i finished the starter packages packaging..
2011-03-21T23:53:05  <amstan> i need to look at the tools section
2011-03-21T23:53:17  <antimatroid> don't package the c++ one yet :P
2011-03-21T23:53:46  <amstan> umm
2011-03-21T23:53:49  <amstan> it's a makefile
2011-03-21T23:53:52  <antimatroid> ah, okay
2011-03-21T23:53:53  <amstan> i type make to make it
2011-03-21T23:53:56  <amstan> make clean to delete it
2011-03-21T23:54:04  <amstan> so.. tools
2011-03-21T23:54:06  <amstan> what do we need?
2011-03-21T23:54:23  <amstan> i have sample bots, so that's good
2011-03-21T23:54:28  <antimatroid> visualiser, engine, bot, sample bots
2011-03-21T23:54:29  <amstan> i need an offline engine
2011-03-21T23:55:03  <janzert> playgame.py
2011-03-21T23:55:12  <antimatroid> it would be awesome if there was a program like jbotmanager that we released officially
2011-03-21T23:55:18  <antimatroid> but i don't know who could write it
2011-03-21T23:55:21  <antimatroid> delt0r is quite busy
2011-03-21T23:55:27  <amstan> antimatroid: we'll use what we have for now
2011-03-21T23:55:32  <amstan> janzert: how user friendly is that?
2011-03-21T23:55:51  <janzert> about as userfriendly as our past engines were I believe :P
2011-03-21T23:55:55  <janzert> that is not at all
2011-03-21T23:56:10  <antimatroid> yep, i agree with that
2011-03-21T23:56:23  <antimatroid> we could give bat/shell scripts etc. that do it all
2011-03-21T23:56:29  <antimatroid> or just give example commands like previously
2011-03-21T23:56:37  <amstan> a readme.md should suffice
2011-03-21T23:56:52  <amstan> should be the same as the one online..
2011-03-21T23:57:50  <amstan> is playgame.py all i need in terms of tools?
2011-03-21T23:58:17  <janzert> a visualizer for the resulting output?
2011-03-21T23:59:20  <janzert> which I believe Frontier was working on a way to easily run the current one locally
