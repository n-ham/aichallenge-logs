2011-05-18T03:55:17  <antimatroid> otherwise mit would be my number one preference
2011-05-18T03:55:55  <aerique> antimatroid: i'd chose education over politics in this case
2011-05-18T03:55:55  <antimatroid> Frontier: yeah, MIT is one of the best uni's in the world

2011-05-18T03:58:10  <Frontier> McLeopold: I used the ant script on Windows and it worked there, too. I really wonder what needs root access there? Is it something with an incorrect wrong working folder? It should download all the stuff right into the source code folder.
2011-05-18T03:58:11  <antimatroid> it would be cool to get a change

2011-05-18T04:01:26  <smiley1983> I seem to recall some talk awhile ago about the possibility of using makefiles to compile the bots. Is this option still being considered?
2011-05-18T04:02:03  <aerique> smiley1983: apparently not: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/112
2011-05-18T04:02:57  <smiley1983> aerique: thank you
2011-05-18T04:03:22  <aerique> McLeopold: can't we use makefiles because of worker/compiler.py?
2011-05-18T04:03:43  <McLeopold> aerique: it doesn't support it right now
2011-05-18T04:03:58  <Frontier> Just use a language the can go with default compiler settings already :p
2011-05-18T04:04:13  <smiley1983> There are some compiler flags which I would like to use for final compilation before the submission deadline, but the optimizations can be slow, and there's no reason to chew up server time mid-contest for them. Makefiles would provide a neat solution to that.
2011-05-18T04:04:14  <McLeopold> janzert migh have got the jail working for compilation, and if so, then we may be able to do it
2011-05-18T04:04:57  <McLeopold> yes, we all think makefiles would be good, it's a matter of time
2011-05-18T04:05:12  <aerique> McLeopold: if I fix the CL starter to use MyBot.lisp, can I test the changes myself on a test server?
2011-05-18T04:05:14  <smiley1983> Right, thankyou for clarifying
2011-05-18T04:05:24  <aerique> that's a good enough reason indeed
2011-05-18T04:05:38  <smiley1983> I did suspect it might pose some security considerations.
2011-05-18T04:05:45  <McLeopold> aerique, yes, the compiler options are in the source...
2011-05-18T04:06:32  <McLeopold> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py#L216
2011-05-18T04:07:19  <aerique> yeah, i'm looking at that, but i meant whether i can upload a submission.zip somewhere
2011-05-18T04:07:49  <McLeopold> we don't have one running consistently yet
2011-05-18T04:08:03  <aerique> alright, i'll just make the changes then and get back to work ;-)
2011-05-18T04:10:24  <McLeopold> aerique: although, check in with http://hypertriangle.com:13080/ every so often
2011-05-18T04:10:47  <aerique> thanks
2011-05-18T04:12:20  <McLeopold> aerique: btw, I'm new to lisp and trying to learn, but your starter bot still feels out of reach.  perhaps you could make a single file starter bot, and release the full shebang somewhere else?

I also made the initial more elaborate version at the request of mega, since he wanted ASDF and proxy-bot support :-)  (but that has moved elsewhere already: https://github.com/aerique/google-ai-challenge-2011-1-ants)
2011-05-18T04:16:19  <aerique> but i do get the reasoning for make it easy for total beginners, so i'll try
2011-05-18T04:16:44  <McLeopold> aerique: I still don't get proxy-bot.  I need a video of watching a lisper develop in the cli.
2011-05-18T04:18:15  <aerique> i'll try and find something on youtube for you (whether it's clojure, cl or scheme doesn't really matter for the general idea)
2011-05-18T04:18:54  <McLeopold> cool
2011-05-18T04:19:41  <McLeopold> when reading lisp books, they only ever say "lisper like to develop live", but never go into details of techniques
2011-05-18T04:20:20  <aerique> it's not quite dissimilare to live coding if you've ever seen videos of that
2011-05-18T04:21:51  <McLeopold> I've done live coding in debug mode in VS and Eclipse, but that's it.

2011-05-18T07:43:34  <aerique> it's my favourite thing as well :)
2011-05-18T07:44:28  <mcstar> one thing i noticed, that i almost read lisp code as i read text
2011-05-18T07:44:35  <mcstar> very easy on the eyes
2011-05-18T07:44:55  <mcstar> takes time to write it, but then it feels easy to read
2011-05-18T07:45:43  <aerique> good to hear.  that's quite a different viewpoint than most people have concerning lisp code :)
2011-05-18T07:45:56  <mcstar> i think ive read your intro to GA
2011-05-18T07:46:24  <mcstar> do you have some other in-depth example of it?

2011-05-18T07:48:43  <mcstar> you wrote that you run it for 300 iterations?
2011-05-18T07:48:57  <aerique> i have no idea actually.  it very much depends on the cl implementation
2011-05-18T07:49:08  <aerique> feel free to benchmark it yourself :)
2011-05-18T07:49:41  <aerique> 500 total runs in that example

2011-05-18T07:50:39  <mcstar> but i decided that i shouldnt, because i cant guarantee that ill get good results
2011-05-18T07:50:53  <mcstar> i started to write an own visualizer and an engine

2011-05-18T07:52:11  <mcstar> can i ask you about that?
2011-05-18T07:52:15  <aerique> have you got any screenshots of your visualizer?

2011-05-18T12:05:28  <janzert> contestbot: later tell McLeopold where we use .deb files directly is because the repositories either contain too old of a version or don't have it at all.

2011-05-18T14:09:10  <janzert> McLeopold: my problem with java and scala turned out to be that java needs to be allowed 15 threads/processes before it will run
2011-05-18T14:09:20  <janzert> and the sandbox was limiting it to 10
2011-05-18T14:10:15  <janzert> go is rather a pain because it uses a different compiler name depending on if you're compiling 32bit or 64bit
2011-05-18T14:10:39  <janzert> and I haven't even tried to see if D compiles yet

2011-05-18T17:26:48  <janzert> McLeopold: for a new language you should be able to update compiler.py and install the new language into the base chroot and be good to go
2011-05-18T17:27:18  <McLeopold> with the setup script, or by hand?
2011-05-18T17:27:34  <janzert> at the same time, for planetwars the half life of a worker was approximately 8-10 hours so killing them all and starting fresh is what I would do on code updates
2011-05-18T17:27:37  <janzert> by hand
2011-05-18T17:27:57  <McLeopold> do you think our half-life will be higher?
2011-05-18T17:28:08  <janzert> I really hope so
2011-05-18T17:28:25  <McLeopold> should we higher Gordon?  isn't he freelance?
2011-05-18T17:28:36  <janzert> :)
2011-05-18T17:28:55  <McLeopold> let me share rankings
2011-05-18T17:29:05  <McLeopold> git push coming...
2011-05-18T17:29:30  <janzert> even if the workers are stable I don't have much aversion to killing them off and starting fresh ones in order to update them
2011-05-18T17:29:45  <janzert> I don't think we'll be doing that too frequently
2011-05-18T17:30:06  <McLeopold> it takes 30 minutes to install, though
2011-05-18T17:30:15  <McLeopold> btw, games are really slow in the jails
2011-05-18T17:30:29  <McLeopold> games are slow out of the jail as well
2011-05-18T17:30:51  <janzert> really? I can see disk access being fairly slow in the jail but a game shouldn't be doing that much at all
2011-05-18T17:31:03  <McLeopold> our game is a lot of data to churn through
2011-05-18T17:31:28  <janzert> as far as cpu or memory overhead the jail shouldn't be adding any at all
2011-05-18T17:31:36  <McLeopold> I ran some tests at 20 turns and it was taking a lot longer in the jails
2011-05-18T17:31:51  <McLeopold> outside of them, it was almost instant
2011-05-18T17:32:16  <Frontier> what could be causing it?

2011-05-18T17:38:16  <janzert> wouldn't hurt :)
2011-05-18T17:38:31  <janzert> but you pretty much need a free machine or fresh vm to install on

2011-05-18T17:40:16  <janzert> the worker is doing semi-tricky things with chroot and unionfs to get a whole bunch of separate chroots for the separate jails to run in

2011-05-18T17:44:47  <janzert> inside the chroot the submissions run as if they are at /home/jailuser

2011-05-18T17:53:49  <mcstar> quad-trees maybe?
2011-05-18T17:53:56  <McLeopold> no
2011-05-18T17:54:18  <mcstar> how do you test if objects are nearby?
2011-05-18T17:54:25  <janzert> did you maybe try to schroot before the unionfs-fuse filesystem was mounted?
2011-05-18T17:54:28  <McLeopold> we don't really need to do much with nearest neighbor queries
2011-05-18T17:54:47  <janzert> cause schroot would be mounting proc and sys in root/
2011-05-18T17:54:50  <mcstar> McLeopold: can you explain this?
2011-05-18T17:55:01  <janzert> in which case you can probably just delete them at this point

2011-05-18T17:55:37  <janzert> it shouldn't be schroot would be an explicit command by yourself or the sandbox
2011-05-18T17:55:39  <McLeopold> mcstar: we do a full scan in the area of attack radius, the position offsets are cached

2011-05-18T17:56:56  <Frontier> excuse the stupid question, but what you do cannot be done with a bind mount?
2011-05-18T17:57:43  <janzert> McLeopold: ? as in if the machine crashed while a chroot was ongoing
2011-05-18T17:58:02  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-05-18T17:58:29  <janzert> hmm, possibly
2011-05-18T17:59:10  <mcstar> McLeopold: so as far as i understand: you have a grid, NxM, the full dimension of the map is represented by a 2d array, and you bind objects to the squares
2011-05-18T17:59:11  <janzert> Frontier: basically they need copy on write semantics and I don't think you can achieve that with a bind mount point
2011-05-18T17:59:16  <McLeopold> I get a bunch of recovery/copyfiles messages on bootup
2011-05-18T18:00:17  <McLeopold> mcstar: we use a grid/matrix and store ints in them, we also have dictionaries to look up objects by location
2011-05-18T18:01:32  <McLeopold> so we can loop through a list of ants without doing a scan, or check to see if something is at a location, or use the matrix to scan for anything in the surrounding area
2011-05-18T18:01:35  <mcstar> so for example in [n,m] you have 12334 which is an index in another array
2011-05-18T18:01:55  <mcstar> ok
2011-05-18T18:02:24  <mcstar> i was considering space partitioning, but this sounds much simpler
2011-05-18T18:02:44  <McLeopold> the problem with space partitioning is that the space changes each turn
2011-05-18T18:02:53  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-18T18:03:00  <McLeopold> you'd have to do a lot of queries to make up for the overhead
2011-05-18T18:03:00  <mcstar> some fast update would be needed
2011-05-18T18:03:19  <mcstar> ok thx
2011-05-18T18:03:48  <McLeopold> plus, space is wrapped, you have to rewrite standard algos with that in mind
2011-05-18T18:04:15  <McLeopold> there is no such thing as a convex hull in ants :p
2011-05-18T18:05:01  <mcstar> ?
2011-05-18T18:05:01  <McLeopold> or, at least there are many hulls, and you'd want the one with the smallest area, but that's a lot of work
2011-05-18T18:05:11  <mcstar> yes
2011-05-18T18:05:17  <Frontier> hehe, i wrote code that generates the silhouette of land in ants yesterday
2011-05-18T18:05:41  <janzert> McLeopold: take a look in /var/lib/schroot/session/ if there is anything in there then that's probably schroot sessions leftover from a crash
2011-05-18T18:05:54  <McLeopold> janzert: can I just nuke them?
2011-05-18T18:06:03  <janzert> schroot -e should be used to get rid of them

2011-05-18T18:07:02  <janzert> what I'm trying to find is a command to list the session names

2011-05-18T18:08:15  <janzert> yeah, if there are no long names there it probably doesn't list the sessions
2011-05-18T18:08:43  <McLeopold> oooh, it looks like I have 40 sessions in var, with the session names?
2011-05-18T18:08:46  <janzert> well, schroot -e --all should end all the sessions

2011-05-18T19:18:16  <janzert> Frontier: the worker will now install dmd 2.053, but the current starter bot has a deprecation error with it
2011-05-18T19:19:02  <janzert> specifically "std.date and std.dateparse have been scheduled for deprecation. Please use std.datetime instead."

2011-05-18T19:23:00  <janzert> my ants/dist/starter_bots/c is just an empty directory, which I believe is because its a git submodule, how do I get it?
2011-05-18T19:23:21  <McLeopold> git submodule update
2011-05-18T19:23:30  <McLeopold> right after 'git submodule init'
2011-05-18T19:24:05  <janzert> otherwise all starter bots except for lolcode seem to work with compiler.py now

2011-05-18T19:25:09  <McLeopold> lci isn't capable of parsing strings, all the others are hacks, bfns, or special specs
