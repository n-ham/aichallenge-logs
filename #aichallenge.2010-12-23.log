2010-12-23T05:09:48  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: It depends if you have a manifest of destiny.....
2010-12-23T05:12:59  <antimatroid1> delt0r___: consider taking America or Australia from the natives
2010-12-23T05:13:03  <antimatroid1> was that stealing?
2010-12-23T05:13:12  <antimatroid1> i had someone try to argue that it isn't before
2010-12-23T05:14:02  <antimatroid1> dmj111: just tried adding in \r\n everywhere, no love
2010-12-23T05:14:26  <sigh> it sounds like you are trying to make moral judgements by arguing over definitions
2010-12-23T05:14:31  <sigh> that seems a bit silly
2010-12-23T05:14:50  <antimatroid1> i was just curious at one person saying that it isn't an act of stealing
2010-12-23T05:15:01  <antimatroid1> yes it's arguing over definitions, one always is for that kind of thing
2010-12-23T05:15:56  <sigh> having a precise definition is fine, just that you have the unsaid assumption that your definition carries weight in a moral argument
2010-12-23T05:15:56  *** Frontier <Frontier!~Marco_Lei@dslb-088-071-240-096.pools.arcor-ip.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-12-23T05:16:26  <antimatroid1> what would you consider a suitable definition of stealing to be?
2010-12-23T05:16:56  <antimatroid1> then you get to ownership i guess
2010-12-23T05:16:57  <antimatroid1> bleh
2010-12-23T05:17:16  <sigh> dunno... it's a tricky question (another example where this is contentious is in the piracy debate)
2010-12-23T05:17:37  <sigh> my point was that the *real* debate is rarely over the definition
2010-12-23T05:17:47  <sigh> but whether the act in question is justified/moral
2010-12-23T05:19:00  <sigh> another example I've heard is the claim that taxation is theft
2010-12-23T05:19:39  <sigh> in all three cases (conquer, piracy, taxation) the real debate is over whether these acts are justified or not
2010-12-23T05:19:41  <antimatroid1> lol, i have a relevant experience to that
2010-12-23T05:20:17  <antimatroid1> i started using an avatar on a torrent related forum which had piracy is a crime as an animated gif, shaking about like at the start of those movies
2010-12-23T05:20:28  <antimatroid1> apparently people couldn't take the humour and i got banned for refusing to change it
2010-12-23T05:20:56  <sigh> heh
2010-12-23T05:21:12  <antimatroid1> real debate is over the intricate details that make up the defintions
2010-12-23T05:21:19  <antimatroid1> but without defining something, it's hard to argue anything
2010-12-23T05:21:46  <antimatroid1> so i often just end up asking people to define what the mean, so i can base my arguments around that
2010-12-23T05:22:02  <antimatroid1> other times i just say something completely irellevant :)
2010-12-23T05:22:07  <antimatroid1> and spell it wrong
2010-12-23T05:22:48  <sigh> but in this case you are not asking what people mean, you are trying to condemn some action but associating it with something that is usually agreed to be immoral by definition
2010-12-23T05:23:45  <antimatroid1> i don't see taking land by conquest as being any different to walking down to a store and *stealing* something when it comes to classifying the two acts on that
2010-12-23T05:23:55  <antimatroid1> my nit pick was on them somehow making a distinction between the two
2010-12-23T05:24:40  <antimatroid1> it's amusing when people talk about other cultures coming in and ruining australia, even so far as to say ruining it for us australians
2010-12-23T05:24:53  <antimatroid1> i'm white and usually retort wtf, we took it from the aborigines
2010-12-23T05:25:49  <sigh> ok then, let's define what you mean precisly
2010-12-23T05:25:53  <sigh> what was taken?
2010-12-23T05:27:40  <antimatroid1> the right to live on the land as they had previously
2010-12-23T05:28:18  <antimatroid1> one could hardly argue we didn't come in and impose ourselves on them
2010-12-23T05:28:58  <sigh> see again, you are trying to drag this into a moral debate, rather than one over definition
2010-12-23T05:29:05  <sigh> imposition is different from stealing
2010-12-23T05:29:21  <antimatroid1> you stole in a sense their ownership of the land
2010-12-23T05:29:41  <antimatroid1> they might not want to call it ownership, but under our societies general definition of it, they sort of did
2010-12-23T05:29:56  <sigh> and if you can steal a "right" then most actions (for example, murder) can be classed as stealing
2010-12-23T05:30:43  <antimatroid1> .. and why not allow it to fall under that class?
2010-12-23T05:30:53  <antimatroid1> it's still separated by the murder requirement
2010-12-23T05:31:24  <antimatroid1> i think the job of the government should be to ensure people don't impose on another persons right to live their life how they please
2010-12-23T05:31:37  <sigh> because then the meaning of "stealing" becomes so diluted that it is a placeholder for any unlawful action
2010-12-23T05:31:47  <antimatroid1> a lot of that comes down to *stealing* someones rights if you will
2010-12-23T05:32:27  <antimatroid1> land would probably fall under property rights though? like the stores property that one would steal? :P
2010-12-23T05:32:35  <antimatroid1> now i'm just being annoying, that's my specialty
2010-12-23T05:33:04  <sigh> property rights are a government construct
2010-12-23T05:33:23  <antimatroid1> yes, i know defining that stuff is just as silly
2010-12-23T05:33:53  <antimatroid1> but the reason they are constructed is because it is then considered easier to clarify who has what rights
2010-12-23T05:34:13  <sigh> my point is that you should just ask directly whether conquering a land is immoral, rather then try to change the definition of stealing
2010-12-23T05:34:48  <antimatroid1> i don't think it's changing the definition, that was sort of my original point, i'm not sure there was any argument over the morality of the act :P
2010-12-23T05:35:05  <sigh> diluting the definition, then
2010-12-23T05:35:34  <antimatroid1> if i go and just kick someone out of their house and off their land here, is that stealing?
2010-12-23T05:35:48  <sigh> depends
2010-12-23T05:35:51  <antimatroid1> i expect it would be called as such legally
2010-12-23T05:36:02  <sigh> government can do it legally
2010-12-23T05:36:14  <sigh> banks can do it when the foreclose a house
2010-12-23T05:36:18  <antimatroid1> not without *compensation*
2010-12-23T05:36:35  <antimatroid1> (I'm fairly opposed to them doing it unless really really necessary)
2010-12-23T05:36:36  <sigh> ok, I'll kick you out of your house and give you a $100
2010-12-23T05:36:49  <antimatroid1> they are required to give something like market value
2010-12-23T05:36:55  <antimatroid1> but like i said, i don't like the practice
2010-12-23T05:37:04  <sigh> again
2010-12-23T05:37:14  <sigh> "i don't like" is not a synonym for "stealing"
2010-12-23T05:37:23  <sigh> which is the whole point I am trying to make
2010-12-23T05:37:52  <antimatroid1> hmmm :P
2010-12-23T05:39:15  <antimatroid1> i want to say that's not stealing :P but it is taking away rights
2010-12-23T05:39:27  <antimatroid1> you trapped me
2010-12-23T05:39:36  <sigh> :P

2010-12-23T08:15:50  <delt0r___> learn the basic syntax

2010-12-23T08:17:42  <delt0r___> and hence you can't write it like that
2010-12-23T08:17:55  <Epona> I see

2010-12-23T08:18:29  <UndiFineD> delt0r, I can hack a mainframe in a couple of hours, first you need to locate one, walk up to the guards saying you have an appointment, bring a fake id and the name of someone in IT internal, tell them you have an emergency servicing operation, they let you in and open up a floortile to pull the plug
2010-12-23T08:18:50  <delt0r___> A class is a cookie cutter... you make a cookie of "type" cookie cutter

2010-12-23T08:25:55  <dmj111> sorry, that was a compliment.  You are explaining things very well... and I thought you taught university classes.
2010-12-23T08:26:05  <delt0r___> yea i have
2010-12-23T08:26:06  <delt0r___> thanks
2010-12-23T08:26:25  <dmj111> See, I cannot even get a compliment out let alone explain technical things :)
2010-12-23T08:26:28  <delt0r___> sorry doing more than one thing at a time... didn't follow.. make perfect sense now i read it properly

2010-12-23T08:26:58  <dmj111> thanks.
2010-12-23T08:26:59  <delt0r___> how did you bot do in the end
2010-12-23T08:27:03  <delt0r___> your
2010-12-23T08:27:22  <dmj111> good.  12th.  I am happy with that, yet thinking of the things I could have done better
2010-12-23T08:27:24  <delt0r___> was yours in python, or was that someone else
2010-12-23T08:27:33  <dmj111> yes, python.
2010-12-23T08:27:35  <delt0r___> 12th is very good
2010-12-23T08:27:56  <delt0r___> how hard is it to write "fast" python?
2010-12-23T08:28:38  <dmj111> depends on your definition of fast, of course.  It is very, very easy to write slow python, and it doesn't take too much effort to stay out of the super slow parts.
2010-12-23T08:28:51  <delt0r___> right...
2010-12-23T08:29:07  <delt0r___> was your bot using most of the 1 sec?
2010-12-23T08:29:13  <dmj111> but "fast" pure python is only possible for some things.
2010-12-23T08:29:41  <dmj111> Most of the time it didn't.   The first few moves were always the slowest.
2010-12-23T08:29:52  <delt0r___> I am surprised that python hasn't't got a JIT "vm" yet
2010-12-23T08:30:11  <dmj111> PyPy is working on it, I think.  I should really try to get more involved with th
2010-12-23T08:30:20  <dmj111> the overall community in such things
2010-12-23T08:30:52  <delt0r___> well i haven't done a lot of python, but i activly try to get folks to choose python over perl
2010-12-23T08:31:18  <delt0r___> I can always read python without really knowing python, no so with perl
2010-12-23T08:33:14  <dmj111> I have used it a lot, but have written very little "production" code in it.
2010-12-23T08:33:43  <Erika_> its fun
2010-12-23T08:33:44  <dmj111> I won't begrudge anyone using any higher level language, but I do prefer python to perl.
2010-12-23T08:33:46  <delt0r___> I think a bot that get 12th is pretty close to "production" IMO
2010-12-23T08:34:16  <delt0r___> worked on too many other peoples perl code
2010-12-23T08:34:19  <delt0r___> I hate it
2010-12-23T08:34:32  <delt0r___> give me x86 assembler anyday
2010-12-23T08:34:56  <dmj111> heh, thanks.  I guess what I meant was I have used it a lot at work, but always use it for analyzing other code / data, generating reports, and stuff, but not for code that my employers sell.
2010-12-23T08:35:54  <delt0r___> it is a very solid "scripting" lang. We are moving most of our scripts from bash/perl to python now
2010-12-23T08:36:58  <dmj111> Yep.  I used python + SWIG a lot for testing C++ code and prototyping stuff for a C++ only system.  That was sooo much better than starting in straight C++
2010-12-23T08:36:59  <Erika_> ok I see
2010-12-23T08:37:12  <Erika_> so I need to put the sword breaking as part of another method
2010-12-23T08:37:21  <delt0r___> yea Erika_
2010-12-23T08:37:36  <Erika_> thx for the help!
2010-12-23T08:38:29  <delt0r___> Then you declar a varable of "type" of you class, and then call the method on that variblae
2010-12-23T08:38:32  <delt0r___> frack
2010-12-23T08:38:35  <delt0r___> you get the idea

2010-12-23T08:39:41  <Erika_> yea im epona
2010-12-23T08:40:35  <delt0r___> Just remeber that you don't "run" Erika (the class)

2010-12-23T08:43:37  <delt0r___> the idea is that Erika knows about what to do with its internal state via its methods
2010-12-23T08:44:16  <delt0r___> you call the methods --or in other words tell the varable of type erika what you want to do
