2010-09-19T00:16:18  <antimatroid1> because it's an extremely strict rule and doesn't really cause any issues to you guys
2010-09-19T00:16:32  <amstan> it does..
2010-09-19T00:16:38  <jmcarthur> because it's kind of pointless that a timeout results in DQ whereas most technical errors are just losses
2010-09-19T00:16:51  <antimatroid1> such as?
2010-09-19T00:16:57  <amstan> if someone submits an infinite loop bot he'll just eat resources
2010-09-19T00:17:07  <antimatroid1> no he wont, he'll die first move every game
2010-09-19T00:17:08  <jmcarthur> that's why you have the timeout code, sure
2010-09-19T00:17:08  <antimatroid1> that's quick
2010-09-19T00:17:17  <jmcarthur> no reason for timeout to be DQ though
2010-09-19T00:17:37  <antimatroid1> could have max 5 timeouts or something
2010-09-19T00:17:41  <amstan> discuss this on the mailing list please, i'm just not sure about their reasoning
2010-09-19T00:18:52  <Janzert> is there an open mailing list? the only one I saw (google groups) seemed to be closed to subscriptions
2010-09-19T00:19:29  <jmcarthur> yeah that's a dev mailing list. seems kind of silly to be closed though
2010-09-19T00:19:33  <jmcarthur> IMO
2010-09-19T00:19:35  <amstan> i guess not, issues list then
2010-09-19T00:19:51  <amstan> jmcarthur: stuff about contestants is also discussed there
2010-09-19T00:19:55  <amstan> i think that's one of the reasons
2010-09-19T00:19:56  <jmcarthur> ah
2010-09-19T00:19:57  <amstan> idk
2010-09-19T00:20:00  <jmcarthur> makes sense
2010-09-19T00:20:07  <jmcarthur> although some of the subscribers *are* contestants
2010-09-19T00:20:24  <jmcarthur> which doesn't seem fair, if that's the reason it's closed in the first place
2010-09-19T00:20:26  <amstan> that's one of the things that disagree with my reason
2010-09-19T00:20:38  <amstan> i have no idea, lol
2010-09-19T00:20:40  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-19T00:20:46  <Janzert> :) ok just wanted to make sure I hadn't missed one
2010-09-19T00:20:50  <amstan> go bother jeff
2010-09-19T00:20:59  <amstan> Janzert: you can also try the issue list
2010-09-19T00:22:07  <Janzert> yeah, I'm actually waiting on jeff to get time to add me as a dev and setting up a test environment in the mean time
2010-09-19T00:23:14  <amstan> Janzert: email him, he'll probably get you in
2010-09-19T00:24:45  <Janzert> yeah, that's the communication I've had with him and he said he would be just that he was busy, remind him later :)
2010-09-19T00:30:00  <amstan> contestbot: later tell j3camero Janzert wants on the mailing list, just a reminder
2010-09-19T00:30:00  <contestbot> amstan: As you wish.

2010-09-19T00:58:39  <a1k0n> antimatroid1: nah i had that in hand, it just catastrophically ignored the takeover of the 44 at the bottom
2010-09-19T00:58:53  <a1k0n> which means theres some kind of giant bug
2010-09-19T00:59:03  <greghaynes> So the pop calculation orer goes numfleets += growth rate; add up incoming fleets; repeat
2010-09-19T00:59:14  <a1k0n> most of this bot's games just smoothly draw the enemy down once it has a numerical advantage
2010-09-19T00:59:28  <greghaynes> Not growth rate after incoming fleets are tallied?
2010-09-19T00:59:31  <a1k0n> correct.
2010-09-19T00:59:41  <blbrown_win3> a1k0n, didn't you win last challenge.  Iz remember you
2010-09-19T00:59:56  <a1k0n> so if a planet has n ships at time t and grows at rate g, and a fleet arrives at g+1, then the new population is n+g - (fleet size)
2010-09-19T01:00:07  <a1k0n> er, t+1, not g+1

2010-09-19T01:03:50  <antimatroid1> mine should be ranked higher than like 50th :(
2010-09-19T01:03:54  <a1k0n> and my subsequent efforts so far are worse :(
2010-09-19T01:04:30  <antimatroid1> it's easy to do that
2010-09-19T01:04:44  <antimatroid1> i'm working on fixing up my backend at the moment then fixing a few thigns i don't want it to do
2010-09-19T01:12:17  <pjreddie_> a1kon: that's my problem too! I keep making changes and having my old bot destroy the new one.
2010-09-19T01:12:46  <a1k0n> my new bot utterly defeats my old one, but is weak sauce to everyone else

2010-09-19T01:39:06  <McLeopold> jmcarthur and I talked about that before.  I think he agreed that the confidence should be increased to max and the average should stay the same.
2010-09-19T01:39:15  <sigh> yup
2010-09-19T01:39:23  <McLeopold> Or he convinced me...
2010-09-19T01:39:47  <sigh> you mean confidence should be set to minimum?
2010-09-19T01:39:48  <McLeopold> I guess the thing to do is play on the tcp server for quick results.
2010-09-19T01:40:19  <McLeopold> Well, i supose you could say it that way, but it means your confidence range covers the whole field.
2010-09-19T01:40:29  <McLeopold> Meaning a win or loss moves you around quicker.
2010-09-19T01:40:45  <sigh> ok, yeah... I see what you mean... the confidence interval is increased
2010-09-19T01:40:51  <McLeopold> yes

2010-09-19T01:48:29  <jmcarthur> either way, bayeselo is at least very good. that it's so hard to better it is a good sign, at least

2010-09-19T06:04:11  <delt0r___> But due the intel doing things like "we pay you to *not* stock amd" means there isn't competion
2010-09-19T06:04:21  <sigh> oh well, I'm against that
2010-09-19T06:04:26  <delt0r___> however ARM is comming... i hope... to the desktop

2010-09-19T06:05:33  <sigh> but in regard to market segmentation, it's strikes me as funny that if intel actually manufactured two separate chips then people would not complain even though tht might be MORE expensive
2010-09-19T06:05:50  <graphitemaster> good night everyone
2010-09-19T06:06:25  <delt0r___> sigh: But creating *artifical* segmentation is stupid... sure it can work for a monopolistic companay...

2010-09-19T06:07:40  <delt0r___> from intels point of view... sure why not
2010-09-19T06:07:52  <sigh> why can't it work for a company which is not a monopoly?
2010-09-19T06:08:13  <delt0r___> because they other company can trivily undercut them
2010-09-19T06:08:51  <sigh> not if they can't make a profit by doing so
2010-09-19T06:10:31  <sigh> if the price is below the high end price, you run the risk of not being profitable enough, if the price is above the low end price then you cut out potential buyers

2010-09-19T07:32:40  <bartwe> depends on what you call search
2010-09-19T07:33:02  <sigh> I don't do minimax style search

2010-09-19T07:48:10  <Macuyiko> whereas bartwe seems to execute one turn of expansion (take over close neutral planets), and then immediatly starts building a MST

2010-09-19T08:00:35  <sigh> ah yes
2010-09-19T08:00:53  <sigh> are you saying you should not have attacked it at all, or attacked a move later?

2010-09-19T08:02:02  <bartwe> i think not at all
2010-09-19T08:02:04  <sigh> oh sorry, not attacked it at all
2010-09-19T08:02:19  <sigh> I didn't realise for a sec you were attacking from so far away
2010-09-19T08:02:38  <sigh> red was silly, he wasted 18 units
2010-09-19T08:02:44  <bartwe> i stubbed out the oppertunity cost of long attacks because i couldn't find the right scale and unit
2010-09-19T08:02:57  <sigh> stubbed out?
2010-09-19T08:03:06  <bartwe> return 0;
2010-09-19T08:03:11  <sigh> ah :)
2010-09-19T08:03:26  <bartwe> not having control over units should be a cost
2010-09-19T08:03:55  <sigh> I'd be more concerned that you launched that fleet at all on move 16

2010-09-19T08:04:09  <sigh> *15
2010-09-19T08:04:09  <bartwe> or maybe you see it as expending units, but then there should be a cost in giving the opponent information with such a long window
2010-09-19T08:04:25  <sigh> yes, most definetly
2010-09-19T08:04:47  <sigh> that's why I try to delay my launches as much as possible, especially with coordinated attacks
2010-09-19T08:05:02  <bartwe> yeah at move 16 it allready looks like a stupid move, the recapture would be near instant allready
2010-09-19T08:05:06  <sigh> if you watch carefully, my coordinated attacks mostly reach the destination at the same time

2010-09-19T08:05:34  <bartwe> must be a bug
2010-09-19T08:05:44  <sigh> yeah, I would say so
2010-09-19T08:06:02  <bartwe> the +2 a few moves lower is a recapture guarantee
2010-09-19T08:06:03  <sigh> atm, my code explicitly dis-allows attacking neutrals closer to the enemy
2010-09-19T08:06:32  <sigh> ouch, you capture the 32 as well
2010-09-19T08:06:44  <bartwe> really ?
2010-09-19T08:06:54  <bartwe> hmz, inverted condition somewhere i'm guessing :)
2010-09-19T08:06:55  <sigh> move 21
2010-09-19T08:06:58  <sigh> *41
2010-09-19T08:07:25  <sigh> has to be a bug, I can't see how any sane algorithm would generate those moves :P
2010-09-19T08:07:35  <bartwe> moah, 41 may make sense
2010-09-19T08:08:12  <sigh> how???
2010-09-19T08:08:48  <sigh> red spent like 4 units to take it back

2010-09-19T08:28:09  <misato> :P
2010-09-19T08:28:22  <misato> i've got the "timeout" problem with the java starter package
2010-09-19T08:28:44  <misato> i've read this threadhttp://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=534
2010-09-19T08:28:50  <misato> and tried everything in there
2010-09-19T08:28:55  <misato> but with not solution :(
2010-09-19T08:29:19  <sigh> it times out on the first move?
2010-09-19T08:29:32  <misato> yep
2010-09-19T08:29:48  <misato> it says "player 1 timeout" "player2 timeout"
2010-09-19T08:29:54  <misato> i'm over Mac OS 10.6
2010-09-19T08:30:18  <sigh> what version of java?
2010-09-19T08:30:22  <misato> java version "1.6.0_20" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.3-b01-279, mixed mode)
2010-09-19T08:30:28  <misato> i was looking for it :P
2010-09-19T08:30:53  <sigh> hmmm... java version looks ok
2010-09-19T08:31:08  <sigh> usually timeouts like that mean that the bot is throwing an error
2010-09-19T08:31:17  <hellman> have you tried manual input to bots?
2010-09-19T08:31:31  <misato> no
2010-09-19T08:31:41  <misato> i've just downloaded the starter package
2010-09-19T08:31:55  <misato> and tried with the example bots, just to see if everything was ok
2010-09-19T08:32:09  <sigh> the example bots don't work?
2010-09-19T08:32:17  <misato> exactly
2010-09-19T08:32:25  <sigh> what's the command you are running?
2010-09-19T08:32:25  <misato> don't work any of them, it sais timeout
2010-09-19T08:32:27  <ntroPi> did you use the new .jar files from the thread you cited?
2010-09-19T08:32:42  <misato> yes i've used them

2010-09-19T08:33:15  <misato> well, let's try again

2010-09-19T08:43:06  <misato> this
2010-09-19T08:43:06  <misato> I fixed this by Using the 'invariant' local, which according to the help files of my development tools was designed for inter-machine communication.

2010-09-19T08:46:11  <misato> :P
2010-09-19T08:46:16  <sigh> yes, it is :)
2010-09-19T08:46:38  <misato> it's in AppStore as well, isn't it?

2010-09-19T08:47:45  <HakanD> i wonder how this contest effected the sales
2010-09-19T08:48:41  <fahi> I find it extremly frustrating when you don't know why your bot suddenly stops working in the middle of the game on the server but works well with tcpserver
2010-09-19T08:48:42  <misato> it will sell a lot more (i hope)
2010-09-19T08:48:58  <misato> sigh, are you coding in c++?
2010-09-19T08:49:03  <sigh> misato: yes
2010-09-19T08:49:14  <misato> how do i launch a test?
2010-09-19T08:49:37  <misato> i mean, just to test everything is ok with the example bots
2010-09-19T08:49:39  <rtaycher> Is it the original game of that type? I've played Konquest on Linux which is fairly fun
2010-09-19T08:49:51  <sigh> same way as the java version, but replace "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" with the path to your executable
2010-09-19T08:49:57  <misato> oh ok ^^
2010-09-19T08:50:25  <sigh> fahi: I wrote a script to get the playback from the site and feed it to my bot
2010-09-19T08:50:46  <fahi> sigh: how did you do that?
2010-09-19T08:51:09  <sigh> someone else did it here: http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=628
2010-09-19T08:51:29  <HakanD> reading a1k0n's blog about the tron contest gives lots of good ideas , try it (:
2010-09-19T08:51:33  <sigh> i implemented mine before I realised this was out there, but same idea
2010-09-19T08:52:34  <bartwe> sigh: i optimize for the highest income for enemies on recapture....
2010-09-19T08:52:47  <sigh> HakanD: yeah, I wasn't around for the tron contest, but readind that was interesting
2010-09-19T08:52:48  <misato> i thought all the system was in C++ xDD
2010-09-19T08:52:52  <misato> i'm stupid

2010-09-19T08:52:59  <misato> i've got the same timeouts xD
2010-09-19T08:53:23  <sigh> misato: looks like a problem with the java engine
2010-09-19T08:53:35  <sigh> ok, time to try the python engine :P
2010-09-19T08:53:35  <misato> oh
2010-09-19T08:53:47  <misato> if i pass to the command MyBot
2010-09-19T08:53:52  <rtaycher> didn't the java engine have similar problems last time?
2010-09-19T08:54:03  <misato> oh yes
2010-09-19T08:54:08  <misato> it's a java problem
2010-09-19T08:54:10  <sigh> c++ has java engine last time i checked
2010-09-19T08:54:12  <misato> with the bots
2010-09-19T08:54:18  <sigh> or has that changed?
2010-09-19T08:54:20  <misato> if i use the C++ bot
2010-09-19T08:54:25  <misato> it runs well
2010-09-19T08:54:59  <misato> sigh, it has java engine
2010-09-19T08:55:07  <misato> or i've got java engine here xD
2010-09-19T08:55:15  <sigh> ok, so c++ bot is working with java engine?
2010-09-19T08:55:21  <misato> yep
2010-09-19T08:55:35  <misato> i think it's a problem with the java bots
2010-09-19T08:55:41  <sigh> yeah...
2010-09-19T08:55:42  <misato> because the C++ bot runs well

2010-09-19T08:56:05  <misato> this, is running well
2010-09-19T08:56:10  <contestbot> Top 10 players: adumlah(3505), kcm1700(3434), McLeopold(3433), Macuyiko(3352), montanalow(3306), paulus(3295), wagstaff(3242), dmj111(3217), golfin(3217), George_Whiteside(3192)
2010-09-19T08:57:00  <rtaycher> I just wish I could understand what was wrong with the c# engine,still can't see why it would crash on planet getters.
2010-09-19T08:57:32  <sigh> misato: well, go with that for now... if you really want java I would try to compile the bots from source
2010-09-19T08:57:46  <misato> sigh, i did it as well
2010-09-19T08:57:58  <misato> but with no crashes XD
2010-09-19T08:57:59  <fahi> sigh: thanks, the script works and I do not get any errors replaying the game that just stopped on the server
2010-09-19T08:58:34  <sigh> fahi: probably a tmeout
2010-09-19T08:59:02  <misato> stupids timeouts
2010-09-19T08:59:03  <misato> xDD
2010-09-19T08:59:12  <sigh> and timeouts are wall-clock so it might not even be your fault
2010-09-19T08:59:26  <sigh> server is under a lot of load from what I hear
2010-09-19T09:00:12  <fahi> but there is no way to check if it was a timeout, right?
2010-09-19T09:00:23  <sigh> not that I know of :(
2010-09-19T09:01:12  <HakanD> amstan said new servers are on the way, this would solve this problems for now

2010-09-19T09:03:32  <antimatroid1> hmmm wtf
2010-09-19T09:03:55  <antimatroid1> i swear either my distance function or the engine i have isn't working properly
2010-09-19T09:04:15  <antimatroid1> was the engine changed at all for such errors at any stage? the one that comes with start packages this is
2010-09-19T09:04:21  <bartwe> ah too pesimistic, i assume the enemy can see my new moves in the current move :)
2010-09-19T09:04:56  <sigh> antimatroid1: I think there have been a few updates
2010-09-19T09:05:11  <sigh> I know the initial engine had broken battle resolution
2010-09-19T09:06:59  <sigh> but distance is simple, (int)ceil(sqrt(dx*dx+dy*dy)) so I don't know where that could go wrong (unless it is floating point sneakiness)
2010-09-19T09:07:21  <bartwe> i wonder if some of the timeouts earlier on benzedrine are due to network overload on the server side
2010-09-19T09:08:02  <antimatroid1> on map 65 my engine thinks the distance between planet 1 and planet 10 is 4 moves, but distance function claims otherwise, i'll go check numbers
2010-09-19T09:08:14  <antimatroid1> if someone else would be willing to somehow ping that with their engine and look
2010-09-19T09:08:36  <sigh> I'll have a look
2010-09-19T09:09:22  <bartwe> (int)Math.Ceiling(Math.Sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy));
2010-09-19T09:09:31  <bartwe> dunno
2010-09-19T09:09:50  <bartwe> maybe your sqrt returns an int instead of double ?
2010-09-19T09:09:51  <sigh> I get 4
2010-09-19T09:10:10  <sigh> at least, my bot thinks the distance is 4
2010-09-19T09:10:24  <sigh> I'll check what my engine things
2010-09-19T09:10:27  <sigh> *thiks

2010-09-19T09:10:32  <sigh> :S

2010-09-19T09:17:37  <sigh> you stored the positions as ints

2010-09-19T09:19:54  <antimatroid1> ahuh, in my parseGameStateSetup I added variables today to simplify things and did those as ints

2010-09-19T09:20:00  <antimatroid1> saved me hours of frustration

2010-09-19T09:27:36  <sigh> might have a play around with this map and see if you are right :)
2010-09-19T09:28:19  <bartwe> you need a neutral to break the stalemate in numbers, that or superior tactics, but even that would just mean gaining better growthrate

2010-09-19T09:39:08  <Macuyiko> still a long time to go before the end of the contest though, I'm wondering if people will still come up with some radical changes in strategy
2010-09-19T09:39:18  <bartwe> sure
2010-09-19T09:39:51  <bartwe> someone will figure out how to break the branching problem and start doing minimax
2010-09-19T09:40:03  <Macuyiko> ugh, then I'm boned
2010-09-19T09:40:06  <bartwe> or somethign similair
2010-09-19T09:40:42  <sigh> how do you apply minimax when the turns are interleved?
2010-09-19T09:41:26  * sigh goes and cracks open his AI book
2010-09-19T09:41:41  <sigh> *not interleved
2010-09-19T09:42:07  <bartwe> interleaved ?
2010-09-19T09:42:07  <Macuyiko> good question
2010-09-19T09:42:11  <bartwe> not sure what you mean by that
2010-09-19T09:42:38  <bartwe> ah, now i do
2010-09-19T09:42:49  <sigh> let me rephrase: how do you apply minimax when the turns are simultaneous
2010-09-19T09:43:08  <mega1> you don't
2010-09-19T09:43:33  <bartwe> perfect mirror play starts to come to mind
2010-09-19T09:43:43  <bartwe> which is useless for searching
2010-09-19T09:46:52  <Naktibalda> wasn't it the same problem for tron?
2010-09-19T09:47:09  <sigh> tron was simultaneous as well?
2010-09-19T09:47:19  <mega1> yes, and we still used minimax
2010-09-19T09:47:30  <sigh> how does that work?
2010-09-19T09:47:46  <Naktibalda> nobody discovered the better way :)
2010-09-19T09:47:47  <sigh> assume that your opponent knows your move?
2010-09-19T09:47:52  <mega1> yes
2010-09-19T09:48:02  <mega1> that's what I think is more pessimistic
2010-09-19T09:48:05  <sigh> ok, that makes sense
2010-09-19T09:48:09  <sigh> thank you
2010-09-19T09:48:22  <mega1> assuming that you know your oppenent's move is rather optimistic
2010-09-19T09:48:24  <bartwe> sigh: what if you simply assume the opponent does nothing ?
2010-09-19T09:48:26  * Naktibalda should read what the minimax is :)

2010-09-19T09:59:42  <delt0r___> well its just a normal jar... with a manifiest file...
2010-09-19T09:59:44  <delt0r___> jar --help
2010-09-19T09:59:54  <user42> delt0r___: i tried "jar -cf MyBot.jar *.class"
2010-09-19T09:59:58  <delt0r___> or use the IDE you are using to do it for you
2010-09-19T10:00:06  <delt0r___> or an ant task
2010-09-19T10:00:26  <delt0r___> you need to tell it what class is the "main"
2010-09-19T10:00:45  <delt0r___> so that java -jar MyBot.jar
2010-09-19T10:00:48  <delt0r___> will work
2010-09-19T10:00:53  <delt0r___> otherwise just use
2010-09-19T10:01:03  <delt0r___> java -cp MyBot.jar MyBot
2010-09-19T10:01:03  <user42> delt0r___: ok, thank u very much. i'll check this
2010-09-19T10:01:28  <user42> delt0r___: java -cp ... in stead of jar -cf ?
2010-09-19T10:01:41  <delt0r___> no to "run" the jar
2010-09-19T10:01:49  <user42> delt0r___: ok, thanks
2010-09-19T10:01:50  <delt0r___> so for your bot command line

2010-09-19T10:05:29  <elijahbal> Hello
2010-09-19T10:05:36  <elijahbal> do you have an idea of how to kill ragebot ?
2010-09-19T10:05:37  <user42> delt0r___: i read some ppost in the forum about an python lib with functions for simulating the "future". is there some for java? i've done some simple simulation in MyBot
2010-09-19T10:06:02  <delt0r___> user42: I don't know... i write all my own code.
2010-09-19T10:06:03  <elijahbal> user42: I wrote a recursive method to see the future of the game, but it doesn't help so much
2010-09-19T10:06:12  <sigh> elijahbal: work on your defence
2010-09-19T10:06:32  <delt0r___> I have a java player... but for the game "model" i use a simpler model
2010-09-19T10:06:58  <delt0r___> I see the future based only on existing fleets + fleets I plan to launch this turn
2010-09-19T10:07:04  <elijahbal> Defense .. Yes I do not have a  real defense  but for map18.txt, you can see that rage bot is really near of my planet so it doesn't let me so much time.
2010-09-19T10:08:00  <sigh> elijahbal: I wouldn't worry about those maps with close planets right away... make sure you can beat ragebot on most other maps
2010-09-19T10:08:00  <HakanD> so, if enemy is close to you, apply your defense strategy accordingly
2010-09-19T10:08:31  <sigh> but yes, close enemy requires more sophisticated defence
2010-09-19T10:08:36  <HakanD> top bots gives some good ideas about this (:
2010-09-19T10:08:38  <user42> delt0r___: which is your bot ?

2010-09-19T10:09:57  <elijahbal> Naktibalda: I meant map30
2010-09-19T10:10:12  <elijahbal> hey, oh the java game engine (1.2) is buggy
2010-09-19T10:10:22  <delt0r___> right now i am finsihing my java game player, TCP watcher and humanBorg player
2010-09-19T10:10:28  <delt0r___> then i will release it
2010-09-19T10:10:43  <user42> delt0r___: ok. cool.  her is mine: http://ai-contest.com/profile.php?user_id=8315
2010-09-19T10:10:45  <Naktibalda> Draw
2010-09-19T10:11:10  <delt0r___> user42: not bad
2010-09-19T10:11:16  <Naktibalda> probably I get Draws in 4 or 6 maps where my bot can't win
2010-09-19T10:12:04  <Naktibalda> my bot should take a planet in a corner, probably its' too far
2010-09-19T10:13:03  <delt0r___> Naktibalda: A draw? that would be hard wouln't it... i mean to have the same number of ships at turn 200?
2010-09-19T10:13:07  <Naktibalda> one small adjustment and my bot wins
2010-09-19T10:13:50  <Naktibalda> it remainded 1:1 situation, because my bot didn't dare to capture a planet in a corner
2010-09-19T10:13:59  <Naktibalda> I had max_distance/2 limit for attacks
2010-09-19T10:15:34  <elijahbal> http://pastebin.ca/1944178 <-- look

2010-09-19T10:21:48  <elijahbal> no the game doesn't continue
2010-09-19T10:21:53  <elijahbal> but it should I think
2010-09-19T10:23:31  <Naktibalda> your bot crashed or did an invalid move
2010-09-19T10:24:53  <sigh> what a frustrating loss: http://www.ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4581708 ><
2010-09-19T10:26:24  <bartwe> sigh got very close to losing
2010-09-19T10:26:29  <HakanD> good defense (:
2010-09-19T10:26:44  <bartwe> the single tick loss of the one planet would shift it away from him
2010-09-19T10:26:58  <sigh> bartwe: sigh did lose
2010-09-19T10:27:17  <bartwe> ah, point in case
2010-09-19T10:27:17  <sigh> by 4 planets
2010-09-19T10:27:21  <sigh> move 108
2010-09-19T10:27:24  <bartwe> single tick loss of parity
2010-09-19T10:27:56  <sigh> I had to parse the playback string to figure that one out
2010-09-19T10:28:23  <sigh> defence definitely needs work
2010-09-19T10:28:36  <sigh> my guess is that these stalemates will become much more common with the top bots
2010-09-19T10:29:01  <delt0r___> sigh: I am surprised...
2010-09-19T10:29:21  <delt0r___> Its not a very good AI if it can't work out that its not getting ahead
2010-09-19T10:29:40  <sigh> my AI doesn't know anything about who's ahead :P
2010-09-19T10:29:40  <delt0r___> and after 200 turns with ships==ships
2010-09-19T10:29:52  <sigh> it doesn't know the ship count or the total growth rate :P
2010-09-19T10:29:55  <delt0r___> oh... Mine does
2010-09-19T10:29:56  <sigh> quite stupid :D
2010-09-19T10:29:59  <delt0r___> income and ships
2010-09-19T10:29:59  <bartwe> delt0r: mirror play is nearly unavoidable for the best ais
2010-09-19T10:30:07  <Naktibalda> NewBot vs RageBot 99/100 Avg Turns: 78.0
2010-09-19T10:30:16  <Naktibalda> elijahbal: thanks for a map :)
2010-09-19T10:30:40  <Naktibalda> hmm, I have to modify test.py to find that strange map where my bot can't win
2010-09-19T10:30:43  <delt0r___> bartwe: I don't really think so... Unless your getting really close to the "optimal" aka minmax search
2010-09-19T10:31:00  <bartwe> delt0r: optimal is the goal here
2010-09-19T10:31:10  <sigh> didn't Zannick have copybot on the tcp?
2010-09-19T10:31:14  <delt0r___> but impractical
2010-09-19T10:31:18  <sigh> I recall it didn't do that well
2010-09-19T10:31:34  <delt0r___> sigh: its has to be one turn out of sync
2010-09-19T10:31:50  <delt0r___> you don't get to see what the other is doing till after your done
2010-09-19T10:31:57  <sigh> delt0r___: yes, I know
2010-09-19T10:32:14  <delt0r___> so thats an automatic copybot==looser
2010-09-19T10:32:28  <delt0r___> try copying moves in chess
2010-09-19T10:33:14  <sigh> this is more symmetrical than chess, and plenty of places with 2nd move advantage
2010-09-19T10:34:19  <delt0r___> there is no second move advantage if you are "constrained" to make the same move
2010-09-19T10:34:33  <delt0r___> because you use none of the extra information
2010-09-19T10:35:13  <sigh> I guess I'll have to code one up myself, it will be good for testing anyway

2010-09-19T10:47:29  <bartwe> delt0r: real random maps would give unfair advantages
2010-09-19T10:47:48  <bartwe> would require larger sample sizes for representative outcomes
2010-09-19T10:47:56  <bartwe> also 'real' random is hard to get
2010-09-19T10:48:28  <delt0r___> bartwe: Yea.. you would need a very large number of games --since i think even a bad bot would win quite often in random maps
2010-09-19T10:50:03  <delt0r___> I am not actually sugesting random maps btw.. I still favour rules that permit large numbers of games
2010-09-19T10:50:18  <bartwe> argh

2010-09-19T11:08:53  <bartwe> ah
2010-09-19T11:08:55  <bartwe> that works
2010-09-19T11:09:26  <delt0r___> well yea... its desinged to support not restarting bots for the process setup and teardown
2010-09-19T11:09:47  <delt0r___> since thats pretty slow with java... but that would work with anything...
2010-09-19T11:10:22  <delt0r___> the bot just needs to reset isself with a "reset" --or just use default behavour

2010-09-19T11:47:15  <bourbaki> do you discuss strategies in here?
2010-09-19T11:47:24  <antimatroid> i tend not to
2010-09-19T11:47:24  <delt0r_> why not
2010-09-19T11:47:27  <antimatroid> you are welcome to
2010-09-19T11:47:34  <bartwe> only if you want your enemy to be stronger :)
2010-09-19T11:47:47  <delt0r_> sharing is caring...
2010-09-19T11:47:57  <bourbaki> im not participating just would like to talk about some strategies
2010-09-19T11:48:23  <bourbaki> has anyone tried out ant colony optimization yet?

2010-09-19T11:48:59  <bourbaki> so the better bots are all handcrafted?
2010-09-19T11:49:20  <bourbaki> is there any way to train the bots offline?
2010-09-19T11:49:29  <delt0r_> It may work to decide "what to do" but not in game... in fact i doubt it would work then either
2010-09-19T11:49:36  <delt0r_> sure

2010-09-19T11:50:11  <delt0r_> but you need to "preserve" the offline/online bit for the server... you are not alwoed to write to disk
2010-09-19T11:50:14  <bourbaki> well what i thought was that id like to model all the support functions in the ant colony in a vector, then map that with a SOM
2010-09-19T11:50:26  <delt0r_> and your bot is restarted each time
2010-09-19T11:50:47  <bourbaki> to have some strategies and reverse engineer the problem space with the viterbi algorith (HMM) to categorize the enemy
2010-09-19T11:50:59  <delt0r_> interesting...
2010-09-19T11:51:08  <bourbaki> yes but i could compile the strategy as the source code
2010-09-19T11:51:20  <bourbaki> so id train the ai offline agains the SOM categories

2010-09-19T11:51:34  <delt0r_> Whats the hidden states in this case?
2010-09-19T11:51:35  <bourbaki> then use the HMM to determine the other guys strategy
2010-09-19T11:51:41  <delt0r_> oh ic
2010-09-19T11:51:42  <antimatroid> lets see how this goes
2010-09-19T11:51:52  <bourbaki> hidden states would be the support functions the probability etc
2010-09-19T11:52:12  <bourbaki> and then use the online optimization to adapt
2010-09-19T11:52:22  <antimatroid> timeout against ragebot, great start
2010-09-19T11:53:20  <bourbaki> how does a random bot rank?
2010-09-19T11:53:47  <delt0r_> bourbaki: badly
2010-09-19T11:53:52  <delt0r_> very badly
2010-09-19T11:53:54  <DirtyKeyboard> bourbaki: probably tight after the stallbots
2010-09-19T11:54:05  <bourbaki> another thing that would interest me is if there could be some kind of proof if there is a single best or not loose strategy
2010-09-19T11:54:28  <DirtyKeyboard> bourbaki: I discussed that with a friend
2010-09-19T11:54:45  <bartwe> bourbaki: two perfect bots would be locked in a pure mirror stalemate i think
2010-09-19T11:54:46  <bourbaki> i thought that a petri net might be an idea to start a proof
2010-09-19T11:54:49  <DirtyKeyboard> bourbaki: if the objective was to lose, it would actually be a hard problem too
2010-09-19T11:54:50  <bourbaki> or lattice bolzmann
2010-09-19T11:54:52  <delt0r_> bourbaki: exsitance of such a thing should be provable... however i don't think its in any way practical
2010-09-19T11:55:32  <bourbaki> well i think its totally useless to handcraft something if you can search the space for a strategy
2010-09-19T11:55:43  <bartwe> very meta
2010-09-19T11:55:49  <bartwe> searching for a search strategy

2010-09-19T11:56:29  <bourbaki> delt0r heh true
2010-09-19T11:57:08  <bourbaki> did anyone try to decrease the problem space, for a model?
2010-09-19T11:57:15  <antimatroid> there exists an optimal strategy
2010-09-19T11:57:19  <bourbaki> i know very fuzzy
2010-09-19T11:57:21  <antimatroid> it's a draw
2010-09-19T11:57:39  <bourbaki> how does the ranking work? would always draw get you to top?
2010-09-19T11:57:41  <antimatroid> assuming both players play it
2010-09-19T11:57:59  <antimatroid> it's some kind of elo ranking system, not sure if that would work or not
2010-09-19T11:58:03  <bartwe> bourbake: depends, if you draw highly ranked players you do
2010-09-19T11:58:10  <bourbaki> if the bots are smart theyd solve the prisioners problem and noone attacks each other ;0 ?
2010-09-19T11:58:11  <bartwe> but likely you wont get selected to play them
2010-09-19T11:58:12  <antimatroid> you shouldn't be drawing against shit players
2010-09-19T11:58:27  <antimatroid> bourbaki: it's not always that simple
2010-09-19T11:59:00  <bourbaki> are you guys working on a analysis toolbox?
2010-09-19T11:59:10  <delt0r_> then to shake things up... push the map sizes up a bit... or have 3 way games.
2010-09-19T11:59:32  <bartwe> bourbaki: so your thinking of an academic approach ?
2010-09-19T11:59:40  <bourbaki> bartweyes
2010-09-19T11:59:41  <delt0r_> now your state space is really large and optimal play will not be possible with 1 sec turn time
2010-09-19T12:00:00  <bourbaki> not interested in the real time problem really but in getting more into the problem and its model
2010-09-19T12:00:14  <bourbaki> delt0r agree
2010-09-19T12:00:19  <antimatroid> it's a lot harder to try and implement an optimal solution than you might think
2010-09-19T12:00:31  <bartwe> bourbaki: the concurrent move side of the proble is stumping the usual approaches
2010-09-19T12:00:34  <bartwe> suggestions ?
2010-09-19T12:00:35  <bourbaki> but suppose you could decrease the problems dimensions by the analysis
2010-09-19T12:01:01  <bourbaki> bartwe pardon?
2010-09-19T12:01:15  <delt0r_> bartwe: In Academia you change the problem... make it round robin ;)
2010-09-19T12:01:39  <antimatroid> you can decrease it, but not that much
2010-09-19T12:01:46  <antimatroid> i love game theory, but it's really not all that useful for this
2010-09-19T12:01:53  <bourbaki> hehe, as i said im more interested in a model, the math behind it
2010-09-19T12:01:55  <bartwe> delt0r: feel free to make projections, the core description doesn't change
2010-09-19T12:02:46  <bartwe> bourbaki: luckily the problem has resisted such anaylis
2010-09-19T12:03:09  <bartwe> or someone isn't sharing
2010-09-19T12:03:16  <bourbaki> has it been a big problem already before the contest?
2010-09-19T12:03:29  <bartwe> not one that i recognize
2010-09-19T12:03:38  <delt0r_> bartwe: Of course
2010-09-19T12:03:38  <bartwe> i guess it could be related to poker or stockmarkets
2010-09-19T12:04:20  <bourbaki> do you have network access in the program?

2010-09-19T14:53:19  <lotek> hi there
2010-09-19T14:53:32  <TapewormGalactos> quick question about the maps: are they always symmetrical?
2010-09-19T14:53:48  <TapewormGalactos> and do they have certain dimensions?
2010-09-19T14:54:34  <Zannick> symmetrical, yes
2010-09-19T14:56:11  <contestbot> Top 10 players: kcm1700(3513), McLeopold(3466), paulus(3397), adumlah(3392), EBraun(3329), montanalow(3310), golfin(3308), pdbpdb80(3255), wagstaff(3233), Loks1982(3230)
2010-09-19T14:57:57  <bartwe> wow, i lose to copybot
2010-09-19T14:57:58  <bartwe> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=46258
2010-09-19T14:58:10  <bartwe> not sure how that was possible
2010-09-19T14:58:33  <amstan> bartwe: lol, fail
2010-09-19T14:59:32  <Zannick> turn 10, you send 33 ships from the lower left planet to the lower right
2010-09-19T15:00:00  <Zannick> slightly earlier you sent 37 from ll to ul
2010-09-19T15:00:19  <Zannick> so copybot did the same, and you lost both ul and lr
2010-09-19T15:01:10  <Zannick> i think that's copybot's fastest non-(D/I/T) win
2010-09-19T15:01:37  <Zannick> i seem to have fixed the invalid order problem
2010-09-19T15:01:44  <Zannick> so now copybot just loses a lot

2010-09-19T15:37:38  <Zannick> wait, how did "go" become an invalid instruction?
2010-09-19T15:38:27  <Zannick> copybot got a 0-turn loss due to invalid order

2010-09-19T15:42:40  <dhartmei_> Zannick: this means it sent anything after it sent 'go', but before got a 'go' from the server.

2010-09-19T15:44:43  <Zannick> huh
2010-09-19T15:45:21  <bartwe> strange wouldn't expect somethign as simple as a copybot to have such an issue
2010-09-19T15:45:28  <Zannick> maybe the connection spazzed and tcp sent the message twice?
2010-09-19T15:45:37  <bartwe> Zannick: near impossible
2010-09-19T15:45:48  <Zannick> so is sending "go" twice
2010-09-19T15:46:10  <Zannick> copybot is nothing more than an implementation of "DoTurn" from the cpp starter code
2010-09-19T15:46:11  <bartwe> maybe a tcp capture with wireshark?
2010-09-19T15:46:30  <bartwe> serverside bug is a possibility too ofcourse
2010-09-19T15:46:55  <bartwe> it would be an improvement if the server would send an INFO or somesuch with the error message
2010-09-19T15:47:09  <dhartmei_> hmm, 17 different bots produced that error recently
2010-09-19T15:47:27  <dhartmei_> it does, the client is terminating before reading it, i have to fix that in tcp.c

2010-09-19T17:48:21  <Cyndre> the minute your enemys planet has 0 ships on it you froze
2010-09-19T17:50:48  <tobiassjosten> Cyndre: Hmm. You're right. That could definitely be a lead.
2010-09-19T17:51:51  <tobiassjosten> Cyndre: Thanks, I'll look in to that. But it doesn't rhyme with my the one other game I lost: http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4587312

2010-09-19T18:00:23  <tobiassjosten> Would be nice to see the output from the game though, so one could spot these problems more easily.
2010-09-19T18:00:36  <Cyndre> thats what the visualizer is :)
2010-09-19T18:01:55  <tobiassjosten> Well, I'm just thinking my Python code probably crashed with a stacktrace, which would have been immensely helpful to me.
2010-09-19T18:03:42  <Cyndre> yup, but gotta use the tools we want or patch the code and propoe a merge
2010-09-19T18:03:49  <Cyndre> er tools we have
2010-09-19T18:03:54  <Cyndre> propose a merge
2010-09-19T18:04:09  <Cyndre> it is open source so you could get that into the server where it mails you a message on crash

2010-09-19T18:12:06  <coventry> It'd be kind of cool to wrap the bot in something which used the information content of the game itself to transmit stack trace info or the like on the bot's failure.  If you don't care about getting your ass kicked, you could communicate a lot of information through the fleet assignments...

2010-09-19T18:16:54  <fahi> I just rewrote the awful python sample bot thing
2010-09-19T18:18:06  <naglijo> coventry: what information could you get that way that you could not get from simulating the game locally by feeding your bot a replay of its states?
2010-09-19T18:18:36  <jmcarthur> interesting http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=553&start=20#p4290
2010-09-19T18:18:51  <naglijo> also: the fleet assignments you can make without instantly losing change based on game state. designing a way to transmit information through them would not be easy

2010-09-19T18:19:17  <jmcarthur> naglijo: not all bots are deterministic
2010-09-19T18:19:33  <jmcarthur> so simulating by feeding the states to your bot isn't always going to work
2010-09-19T18:20:28  <jmcarthur> at least not if you are hoping to get, say, information about server performance or something
2010-09-19T18:20:42  <jmcarthur> actually that applies even with a deterministic bot
2010-09-19T18:21:27  <naglijo> i think trying to get info about sevrer performance in that way would be violating the spirit of the rules. i cant imagine google would allow it. i assumed that's not what he meant
2010-09-19T18:21:56  <jmcarthur> i don't see what would in violation of the spirit of the rules about that
2010-09-19T18:22:17  <jmcarthur> the performance of the server drastically effects how you would write a search algorithm, for example
2010-09-19T18:22:41  <jmcarthur> naglijo: google doesn't run this contest, btw
2010-09-19T18:23:06  <jmcarthur> they just sponsor it in some vague, meaningless way
2010-09-19T18:23:49  <Cyndre> would checking the time the enemy takes to make a move be considered cheating?
2010-09-19T18:23:59  <Naktibalda> :( my new version win 44/100 games against my old version
2010-09-19T18:24:32  <Naktibalda> Cyndre: how can you check? :)
2010-09-19T18:24:33  <coventry> naglijo: Actually, *most* bots making full use of the resources will not be deterministic.  The wall-time limit is random.
2010-09-19T18:24:55  <Cyndre> Naktibalda: just checking time between moves and when you finished and when your new turn started
2010-09-19T18:25:00  <coventry> s/random/fluctuating unpredictably/
2010-09-19T18:25:22  <naglijo> you dont see what would violate the spirit of the rules by making moves that were not intended to win the game but rather to transmit information that would otherwise be impossible to get to you?
2010-09-19T18:26:02  <coventry> "It's easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission." :-)
2010-09-19T18:26:14  <Cyndre> the point being is if you can see they are taking longer maybe try a flood attack where you unleash 1 fleet to every planet from every 1 of your planets trying to make them go based on less information or even timeout
2010-09-19T18:26:18  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: both bots process simultaneously
2010-09-19T18:26:36  <naglijo> yes, i see what you mean about bots not being deterministic and so not being able to replay the game to get stack trace/state info from them
2010-09-19T18:26:37  <jmcarthur> so you would have to time between receiving game states, not between sending orders and receiving the next state
2010-09-19T18:27:14  <jmcarthur> naglijo: all games before the tournament are for testing anyway. testing the server seems perfectly fine to me
2010-09-19T18:28:20  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: yes - if we start at 0 seconds, and I finish at .1 seconds and my next turn starts on .7 seconds  - and then 1 turn dont say go until the time has been reached to time the inbetween time

2010-09-19T18:30:22  <jmcarthur> that's certainly not something that would hurt mine, and mine is already going to be very dependent on how much cpu time it actually gets
2010-09-19T18:30:49  <jmcarthur> you'll only get to "flood" with 23 fleets per turn anyway now that the server does fleet merging
2010-09-19T18:30:52  <Olathe> I've made a starter package which works great on my machine, but it doesn't compile for the contest. Could I ask an admin to check why it won't compile (since e-mails about that are down)?
2010-09-19T18:30:59  <jmcarthur> and that's if you own all planets already :P
2010-09-19T18:31:08  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: no, send 1 fleet to each planet from each one of your planets
2010-09-19T18:31:10  <naglijo> hm
2010-09-19T18:31:18  <naglijo> the map is allowed to have comments in it, isnt it?
2010-09-19T18:31:18  <Cyndre> 500 fleets
2010-09-19T18:31:18  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: oh i see. so 23*23 fleets
2010-09-19T18:31:24  <jmcarthur> still not that many
2010-09-19T18:31:24  <naglijo> are moves also allowed to have comments in them?
2010-09-19T18:31:50  <Naktibalda> they are
2010-09-19T18:31:58  <jmcarthur> naglijo: the spec left that intentionally unstated
2010-09-19T18:31:59  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: then do it for 3 turns etc
2010-09-19T18:32:06  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: or 7 turns
2010-09-19T18:32:23  <naglijo> can you see your bot's actual stdout stream from the prod server, or do they only show you the replay visualization script's output?
2010-09-19T18:32:24  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: the other bot should be doing its own fleet merging anyway, and that can be better merging than the server can do
2010-09-19T18:32:26  <Cyndre> but based on the timing of course to see how they respond
2010-09-19T18:32:32  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: since you don't really care about the sources of the fleets
2010-09-19T18:32:43  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: so really it's just going to be like 23 fleets per turn at max
2010-09-19T18:32:55  <naglijo> also, have people figured out how to get your stderr stream from PlayGame.jar (bundled with the starter packs?)
2010-09-19T18:33:07  <naglijo> i noticed it has a bug where it unintentionally 'eats' your stderr stream..
2010-09-19T18:33:18  <naglijo> its an easy work around though
2010-09-19T18:33:19  <jmcarthur> naglijo: doesn't the new one not do that now?
2010-09-19T18:33:27  <naglijo> i didnt know there was a new one, woops.
2010-09-19T18:33:30  <Cyndre> I am sure only a small percentage actually change how the fleets are handled and most will problably do a for x in pw.Fleets() type of thing
2010-09-19T18:33:44  <jmcarthur> i'm not as sure as you, is all
2010-09-19T18:34:33  <Cyndre> but like I said - using the timing to check for coding weakness's
2010-09-19T18:34:39  <jmcarthur> it's a tactic that will probably work against a lot of badly coded bots, but will be actively harmful against better bots, so at best you would end up being the "best bot that still sucks" :P
2010-09-19T18:34:57  <jmcarthur> the timing trick may work if you aren't doing search
2010-09-19T18:34:58  <naglijo> Cyndre: when your opponent said 'go' isnt accessible to you

2010-09-19T18:35:56  <Naktibalda> pw.Fleets() is nearly useless
2010-09-19T18:36:00  <Cyndre> I agree

2010-09-19T18:37:49  <jmcarthur> Naktibalda: old ghc won't run it. i'm hoping we get new sandboxes so i can upload binaries or we at least get new servers with newer versions of software so i can at least use ghc 6.12.3...

2010-09-19T18:38:43  <jmcarthur> delt0r_: the chances of new servers is high. the chances of a better sandbox is not as good
2010-09-19T18:38:59  <delt0r_> 1 out of 2... could be worse
2010-09-19T18:39:18  <jmcarthur> even a better sandbox is still feasible though
2010-09-19T18:39:29  <jmcarthur> if we can get it in KVM or something maybe
2010-09-19T18:39:40  <delt0r_> how is this sandbox for java? is it still a bit performance hit?
2010-09-19T18:39:48  <jmcarthur> no performance hit currently
2010-09-19T18:39:55  <jmcarthur> because the sandbox really doesn't do anything all that great
2010-09-19T18:40:08  <jmcarthur> it's basically just chroot, resource limits, iptables rules, etc.
2010-09-19T18:40:10  <delt0r_> no performance hit is good
2010-09-19T18:40:19  <delt0r_> right...
2010-09-19T18:40:28  <delt0r_> not really a "sandbox"
2010-09-19T18:40:31  <jmcarthur> yeah
2010-09-19T18:40:40  <jmcarthur> which is why everybody is iffy about arbitrary binaries
2010-09-19T18:40:54  <delt0r_> I see the point of source submission
2010-09-19T18:40:56  <jmcarthur> although, frankly, compiling and running arbitrary source code isn't much better

2010-09-19T18:42:04  <jmcarthur> you could also use a disassembler and maybe even get better results than obfuscated source code

2010-09-19T18:44:48  <jmcarthur> yeah. hopefully we get that

2010-09-19T18:45:53  <jmcarthur> dstufft: i think qemu even allows you to specify the cpu cycles per virtual time elapsed, so the apparent performance of the VMs could even be made the same on differently speced machines

2010-09-19T19:02:56  <greghaynes> ah, google == ai challenge

2010-09-19T19:03:10  <jorge__> Google says "error while compiling submission"
2010-09-19T19:03:12  <delt0r_> :/
2010-09-19T19:03:23  <jorge__> that's it :)
2010-09-19T19:03:26  <Naktibalda> don't call it google

2010-09-19T19:03:50  <greghaynes> google = google.com; ai contest = ai-contest.com ;)
2010-09-19T19:04:00  <jorge__> ok sorry :)
2010-09-19T19:04:04  <greghaynes> heh, np
2010-09-19T19:04:05  <jorge__> Java
2010-09-19T19:04:32  <jorge__> I'm sure I'm going to get top100 with my improvements, so I'm very impatient to test it ;)
2010-09-19T19:04:35  <greghaynes> jorge__: Did you try also running your bot using the tool?
2010-09-19T19:04:48  <Naktibalda> did you receive an email about compilation?
2010-09-19T19:04:50  <jorge__> yes, I can see battles here locally
2010-09-19T19:05:20  <jorge__> I received emails with correct compilations, but not new ones with the failure ones
2010-09-19T19:05:25  <Naktibalda> I didn't when it failed, but I got an email when upload was successful. funny, isn't it?
2010-09-19T19:05:41  <jorge__> the same than me
2010-09-19T19:06:01  <jorge__> so I have no clue what can happen to my code that the aicontest doesn't like :(
2010-09-19T19:07:13  <jorge__> Is it ok to change PlanetWars.java and Planet.java, etc., right?
2010-09-19T19:07:19  <delt0r_> yea
2010-09-19T19:07:34  <delt0r_> but MyBot.java must be the entry point
2010-09-19T19:07:45  <jorge__> is there any weird requisite?
2010-09-19T19:07:50  <jorge__> ok, it is
2010-09-19T19:07:52  <delt0r_> MyBot is the static main thats invoked
2010-09-19T19:07:56  <jorge__> permissions?
2010-09-19T19:08:09  <jorge__> yes, I have it
2010-09-19T19:08:10  <delt0r_> only if you write to disk... or use the network
2010-09-19T19:08:22  <jorge__> yes, I write to HD (logging)
2010-09-19T19:08:26  <jorge__> is that disallowed?
2010-09-19T19:08:29  <delt0r_> you can't do that... however that wouldn't make it fail in compliation
2010-09-19T19:08:37  <jorge__> aha ok
2010-09-19T19:08:40  <delt0r_> You can't do that
2010-09-19T19:08:46  <jorge__> I'll try without that
2010-09-19T19:08:51  <delt0r_> No writing to HD --its in the rules
2010-09-19T19:09:15  <Olathe> What's the time limit on compiling?
2010-09-19T19:09:24  <jorge__> and... for logging, locally is there any other solution to log?
2010-09-19T19:09:30  <delt0r_> jorge__: no
2010-09-19T19:09:40  <jorge__> :S
2010-09-19T19:09:43  <delt0r_> You have to use TCP server or something
2010-09-19T19:09:53  <jorge__> ok
2010-09-19T19:09:55  <delt0r_> its just too much for the server to do really
2010-09-19T19:10:12  <delt0r_> I can dump several megs a game.... x100000
2010-09-19T19:10:15  <delt0r_> thats a lot
2010-09-19T19:10:58  <greghaynes> I think sockets are not allowed
2010-09-19T19:11:15  <Olathe> Could an admin please take a look at http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=732 ?

2010-09-19T20:05:44  <Cyndre> creating a game state I guess - list of every planet and the future turns upto 200
2010-09-19T20:06:15  <rogue780> I know I should probably ask a language specific channel, but ya'll are usually more helpful. In Java, if I have, say, List<Planet> planets and List<Planet> myPlanets (which was created by for(Planet p: planets){if(p.Owner() == 1) myPlanets.add(p)} , if I make a change to Planet in myPlanets, the same change is made in the corresponding planet in planets since they are the same object. Am I right? I apologize for the ignorance

2010-09-19T20:06:58  <Naktibalda> are you going to beat PHP bot?
2010-09-19T20:07:04  <rogue780> Naktibalda, I have been
2010-09-19T20:07:44  <rogue780> well, until friday anyway, then I stopped playing on the TCP server to work on ErrBot4.
2010-09-19T20:10:30  <sigh> Cyndre: that's useful to have... I personally just calculate up the the arrival of the last fleet
2010-09-19T20:11:23  <Naktibalda> hmm, 200 turns is an idea
2010-09-19T20:12:24  <sigh> yeah, a static 200 is simpler
2010-09-19T20:12:35  <rogue780> Cyndre, that's what I've been doing, but instead of going 200 turns out, I'm only going out the max distance number of turns and then each turn, I am creating a new turn at the end of my array
2010-09-19T20:13:21  * Naktibalda was thinking how to avoid recalculation at each turn, static array would be usefull for that proble,
2010-09-19T20:14:02  <sigh> atm, I don't have issues with speed, so optimising away recalculation just isn't worth it for me
2010-09-19T20:14:42  <rogue780> I thought about doing the 200 turn array, but I thought it might get complicated since at each turn I would have to recalculate 200-n turns depending on what I or my enemy do. this way, I only have to calculate around 30 turns or so max
2010-09-19T20:15:00  <rogue780> at a time that is
2010-09-19T20:15:40  <rogue780> I hope the performance that I'll gain from that won't be overtaken by the  cost of instantiating a new turn object every turn

2010-09-19T20:19:00  * rogue780 is listening to crickets
2010-09-19T20:20:32  <jmreardon> merely instantiating an object is pretty cheap in java iirc
2010-09-19T20:22:15  <rogue780> hopefully cheaper than modifying 200-n objects
2010-09-19T20:23:01  <sigh> honestly, I don't see either being a performance bottleneck
2010-09-19T20:24:17  <sigh> when you start running a lot of simulations then you need to start worrying about data-structures :)
2010-09-19T20:27:04  <Naktibalda> better data structures let simplify algorithms
2010-09-19T20:28:11  <sigh> Naktibalda: simplifying algorithm and increasing performance are two different goals :P
2010-09-19T20:28:20  <Naktibalda> right
2010-09-19T20:28:32  <Naktibalda> ultimate goal is victory :)
2010-09-19T20:28:50  <sigh> but yeah, currently I optimizing for flexibility, ease of refactoring and simplification of code

2010-09-19T20:33:11  <Tnargav> Hi there, how should a command in cmd window look like to try my bot in C++? There is only java example - which works for bots - but I can't run mine ;/
2010-09-19T20:33:34  <Naktibalda> "bot.exe"
2010-09-19T20:34:06  <Tnargav> so instead of "jaca mybot" type "bot.exe" right?
2010-09-19T20:34:11  <Tnargav> java*
2010-09-19T20:34:14  <rogue780> or "./MyBot" if you're running linux
2010-09-19T20:34:17  <rogue780> Tnargav, yes
2010-09-19T20:37:56  <Tnargav> Hm... I can't even compile the example from the website. Does anyone have good source code that compiles?
2010-09-19T20:41:12  <Naktibalda> starter pack should be good
2010-09-19T20:42:35  <Naktibalda> if it doesn't compile, you need another compiler

2010-09-19T20:42:45  <jorge__> when only a few turns, with the Java TCP client
2010-09-19T20:42:53  <jorge__> is that my fault?
2010-09-19T20:42:54  <Tnargav> from what I see one file wasn't included. It compiled but only with few wornings now. Let's see if it works

2010-09-19T23:05:57  <Cyndre> I need to fix my reinforcement code
2010-09-19T23:06:07  <Cyndre> shouldnt be over reinforcing

2010-09-19T23:07:07  <sigh> yeah, seems like you keep a constant base of 20-30 on any planet
2010-09-19T23:07:15  <sigh> that's a bit conservative
2010-09-19T23:07:16  <deepblue> good evening guys
2010-09-19T23:07:21  <sigh> hi
2010-09-19T23:07:23  <Cyndre> is it?
2010-09-19T23:08:12  <sigh> depends on the position, but I've found a hard limit is generally not good
2010-09-19T23:09:54  <Cyndre> thats part of the reinforcement code anyways
2010-09-19T23:10:12  <deepblue> i have a hard time getting my bod to not stationed too many stuff in the back when it's needed at the front
2010-09-19T23:10:33  <sigh> my planets at the back always send out full growth every turn to closer planets
2010-09-19T23:10:59  <deepblue> I have done too complete rewrite since last weekend
2010-09-19T23:11:00  <sigh> well, not always... they do defend themselved
2010-09-19T23:11:09  <deepblue> one was an utter failure :/
2010-09-19T23:11:16  <sigh> it happens

2010-09-19T23:14:48  <rogue780|away> sigh, how do you calculate whether or not a planet should send reinforcments or attack? I mean, how do you determine what planets are "in the back" vs the ones "in the front" and the ones in the middle?\
2010-09-19T23:14:53  *** rogue780|away is now known as rogue780
2010-09-19T23:15:55  <sigh> rogue780: attacks are based on my planet evaluation function... I don't want to say what that is right now
2010-09-19T23:16:20  <sigh> (my policy on strategy advice is that I am happy to say anything taht I think is common knowledge to the top 10-20 players)
2010-09-19T23:16:33  <amstan> rogue780: average of the distances to the enemy planets?
2010-09-19T23:16:35  <rogue780> come on...it's just between you and me, and I promise I won't use it...
2010-09-19T23:16:39  <sigh> :)
2010-09-19T23:16:59  <amstan> rogue780: scroll to the bottom, say cheese: http://contestbot.hypertriangle.com/channellogs/%23aichallenge/%23aichallenge.2010-09-19.log
2010-09-19T23:17:34  <sigh> amstan: that sounds easy in theory, but it is difficult ot put in practice... at least for me
2010-09-19T23:17:43  <amstan> sigh: why?
2010-09-19T23:18:02  <amstan> sigh: shouldn't take that long
2010-09-19T23:18:24  <sigh> what if the enemy is in separate clusters, how to you count planets that are owned by one player now, but another later?
2010-09-19T23:18:44  <rogue780> hmm...maybe if I divide the map into a 5x5 grid it could aid with analysis
2010-09-19T23:19:12  <sigh> what if an enemy takes a planet right in the middle of an area you control?
2010-09-19T23:19:31  <rogue780> sigh, these are the exact problems I've been running into
2010-09-19T23:19:45  <sigh> yeah, it's not a trivial problem for me
2010-09-19T23:19:51  <amstan> gar!
2010-09-19T23:19:56  <sigh> maybe amstan has an awesome solution :)
2010-09-19T23:20:04  <amstan> i do?
2010-09-19T23:20:19  <rogue780> I've been trying to figure out a reinforcement strategy, but nothing has panned out. I'm hoping my new approach will make it easier
2010-09-19T23:21:06  <sigh> rogue780: this is one thing where it definitely helps to watch the top games
2010-09-19T23:21:11  <deepblue> my problem is how to make it cautiously aggressive and not cautiously passive ;)
2010-09-19T23:21:32  <jmcarthur> my bot doesn't know the difference between defense and offense
2010-09-19T23:21:48  <sigh> reinforcement strategies are slightly easier to figure out than other strategies when watching games
2010-09-19T23:21:51  <deepblue> exactly my problem
2010-09-19T23:22:03  <jmcarthur> mine is by design
2010-09-19T23:22:15  <sigh> the line is kind of blurred for planets that are under attack
2010-09-19T23:22:21  <sigh> so it's not good to make a clear distinction
2010-09-19T23:22:32  <sigh> also you don't want ot fall for the sunk-cost fallacy
2010-09-19T23:24:16  <jmcarthur> yeah, my bot doesn't even care about who owns what planet, actually
2010-09-19T23:24:26  <sigh> :)
2010-09-19T23:24:35  <jmcarthur> like, it's implicitly considered, but it's not an explicit concept
2010-09-19T23:25:27  <deepblue> mine does somehow
2010-09-19T23:25:36  <deepblue> it does like to kill the enemy
2010-09-19T23:25:39  <jmcarthur> at least not in the actual AI part of it. it's concrete in the core simulation  <-- gives away my approach a bit
2010-09-19T23:25:50  <deepblue> hehe
2010-09-19T23:26:05  <deepblue> what is the name of your bot?
2010-09-19T23:26:10  <jmcarthur> it's not up yet
2010-09-19T23:26:15  <deepblue> :)
2010-09-19T23:26:16  <sigh> hmmm... I don't have a simulation yet... only prediction of future states
2010-09-19T23:26:17  <jmcarthur> or on tcp
2010-09-19T23:26:30  <deepblue> not on tcp yet
2010-09-19T23:26:30  <deepblue> ?
2010-09-19T23:26:33  <jmcarthur> prediction is just a simulation heuristic ;)
2010-09-19T23:26:37  <jmcarthur> no not yet
2010-09-19T23:26:41  <deepblue> k
2010-09-19T23:27:00  <jmcarthur> it'll get there. i'm just taking my time
2010-09-19T23:27:07  <sigh> i mean... prediction of states based on current fleet, not prediction of opponent's moves
2010-09-19T23:27:09  <deepblue> sure
2010-09-19T23:27:09  <jmcarthur> and my idea has many interdependent parts

2010-09-19T23:27:27  <sigh> I'm trying to modularize my approach
2010-09-19T23:27:43  <blbrown_win3> do the start packages get updates.  Do I ever need to update during the course of the contest
2010-09-19T23:27:47  <sigh> for example, my redistribution code is independent of my attack code
2010-09-19T23:27:53  <amstan> blbrown_win3: maybe
2010-09-19T23:27:55  <jmcarthur> my indivdual components can be tested in isolation, but they don't form a complete bot except when composed together
2010-09-19T23:28:02  <jmcarthur> *individual
2010-09-19T23:28:08  <amstan> blbrown_win3: what language?
2010-09-19T23:28:15  <blbrown_win3> amstan, java
2010-09-19T23:28:27  <amstan> blbrown_win3: so for starter packages, once they're done their done
2010-09-19T23:28:31  <amstan> the protocol stays fixed
2010-09-19T23:28:36  <blbrown_win3> ok
2010-09-19T23:28:38  <amstan> though, there might be bugs in them
2010-09-19T23:28:47  <deepblue> components?
2010-09-19T23:28:49  <jmcarthur> i am in fact very likely to write unit tests for some of this code :o
2010-09-19T23:28:52  <deepblue> mine has two functions :D
2010-09-19T23:29:08  <blbrown_win3> I am writing a language for my bot ... for some strange reason
2010-09-19T23:29:11  <deepblue> my unit tests were endless time in gdb :/
2010-09-19T23:29:15  <jmcarthur> yeah, like i said, i actually have some code to write :P
2010-09-19T23:29:19  <jmcarthur> ew
2010-09-19T23:29:27  <deepblue> I know
2010-09-19T23:29:31  <deepblue> i might
2010-09-19T23:29:31  <jmcarthur> mine will be properties tested by quickcheck! :D
2010-09-19T23:29:40  <deepblue> rip it all apart in testable chunks one day
2010-09-19T23:30:03  <sigh> what are unit tests?
2010-09-19T23:30:05  <jmcarthur> quickcheck is awesome
2010-09-19T23:30:05  <sigh> j/k :P
2010-09-19T23:30:21  <deepblue> my code is just what comes out when I spend half a night just writing stuff down without much testing
2010-09-19T23:30:33  <deepblue> horrible +/- 1 errors and stuff :D
2010-09-19T23:30:46  <sigh> off by 1 errors can kill in this game
2010-09-19T23:30:48  <jmcarthur> i'd bring lambdabot in here to show off quickcheck, but contestbot would just get noisy since it looks for the @ syntax
2010-09-19T23:31:07  <sigh> contestbot vs lambdabot: FIGHT
2010-09-19T23:31:08  <contestbot> sigh: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2010-09-19T23:31:14  <sigh> :P
2010-09-19T23:31:25  <jmcarthur> yeah off by 1 is the difference between barely winning a battle and losing it completely
2010-09-19T23:31:31  <jmcarthur> lol at that error message
2010-09-19T23:31:46  <deepblue> sigh: with unit tests you for example check a function if it produces the correct output for a given input

2010-09-19T23:39:01  <amstan> oh yeah.. anyone getting the referrence from the success messages?
2010-09-19T23:39:02  <amstan> @success
2010-09-19T23:39:02  <contestbot> amstan: Ready to serve, my lord.
2010-09-19T23:39:11  <deepblue> lol
2010-09-19T23:39:13  <rogue780> will turns remaining reach 0 when the fleet hits the planet, or will the lowest number it reaches be 1, and if so would the be the turn that it hits or the turn before it hits?
2010-09-19T23:39:51  <sigh> you won't be given fleets with turns remaining = 0
2010-09-19T23:39:52  <McLeopold> On the server side, it should hit zero, do battle, then disappear
2010-09-19T23:40:06  <deepblue> yes
2010-09-19T23:40:17  <rogue780> so I'll never see it hit 0 then
2010-09-19T23:40:20  <deepblue> so if you spawn a fleet with distance 1
2010-09-19T23:40:25  <deepblue> exactly
2010-09-19T23:40:34  <rogue780> thanks. that is very important to know
2010-09-19T23:40:52  <sigh> someone said that distance 1 planets weren't going to be allowed?
2010-09-19T23:41:08  <jmcarthur> send state, receive orders, depart, advance and grow, fight, check end conditions
2010-09-19T23:41:12  <deepblue> they should make a map with a chain of distance one planets :)
2010-09-19T23:41:30  <jmcarthur> those steps are repeated exactly n times, for n = number of turns
2010-09-19T23:41:40  <sigh> stealth battles!
2010-09-19T23:41:52  <jmcarthur> and some of those steps can also check for end conditions on their own (errors)

2010-09-19T23:53:57  <McLeopold> If I submitted RandomBot to the official server, would my upcoming losses drag down the rating of everyone I've beat?
2010-09-19T23:54:18  <sigh> your rating is wiped when you upload a new bot
2010-09-19T23:54:28  <sigh> it will work on tcp though :P
2010-09-19T23:54:51  <McLeopold> Yeah, my rating.  But what about other people's rating?

2010-09-19T23:55:07  <McLeopold> Would they be considered to have lost to a 1500 bot?
2010-09-19T23:55:36  <sigh> i assume the game of your old bot no longer count... but i'm just guessing
2010-09-19T23:55:41  <sigh> *games
2010-09-19T23:56:16  <contestbot> Top 10 players: McLeopold(3601), kcm1700(3492), EBraun(3434), paulus(3399), adumlah(3355), golfin(3354), sighbot(3271), Titannet1(3245), locutus(3243), wagstaff(3223)
2010-09-19T23:56:36  <FlagCapper> Is anyone getting a "connection refused" message on the tcp server?
2010-09-19T23:56:51  <sigh> McLeopold: btw, McLeopold.5 on tcp the bot you have on the main site?
2010-09-19T23:57:05  <sigh> your main site one seems stronger
2010-09-19T23:57:30  <McLeopold> No, it's designed to lose, but just barely.

2010-09-19T23:57:43  <sigh> hah
2010-09-19T23:57:52  <McLeopold> I learn more when I lose than when I win.
2010-09-19T23:57:53  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: on the official server each submission is considered a new bot and old submissions are simply hidden from the rankings
2010-09-19T23:57:57  <deepblue> ;)
2010-09-19T23:58:08  <jmcarthur> oh, and of course old submissions no longer play games
2010-09-19T23:58:16  <McLeopold> Okay.  I though I saw some odd ranking moves, so I was wondering.
2010-09-19T23:58:23  <deepblue> i also sit here just waiting for games I lose
2010-09-19T23:58:31  <deepblue> to analyse
2010-09-19T23:58:33  <McLeopold> But, I can still see my games against old submitions.
2010-09-19T23:58:38  <jmcarthur> right
2010-09-19T23:58:48  <jmcarthur> because they still affect your current submission

2010-09-19T23:58:51  <sigh> McLeopold: if you want to be malicious, you need a bot which switches to random mode after x days :P
2010-09-19T23:59:08  <jmcarthur> lol
2010-09-19T23:59:13  <jmcarthur> that would be awesome
2010-09-19T23:59:25  <McLeopold> what would that do for me?
2010-09-19T23:59:43  <jmcarthur> nothing, but it would screw up all the high ranked players that your bot already played against
2010-09-19T23:59:53  <jmcarthur> and beat, that is
