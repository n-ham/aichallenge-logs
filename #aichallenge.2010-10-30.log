2010-10-30T01:22:33  * amstan raises from the dead, looks around
2010-10-30T01:23:04  <amstan> davidd: so, you just discovered irc today?
2010-10-30T01:23:10  <McLeopold> amstan: do you have any ability to make changes to the official site?
2010-10-30T01:23:20  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, why?
2010-10-30T01:23:34  <McLeopold> How hard would it be to allow people to change their profile info?
2010-10-30T01:23:49  <amstan> it would involve writing code
2010-10-30T01:23:57  <amstan> and i really don't want to do that, i have my own code too
2010-10-30T01:24:19  <amstan> i will svn update if there's any appropriate code that people want
2010-10-30T01:24:44  <McLeopold> own code?
2010-10-30T01:25:21  <Zannick> there basically isn't anything to enable profile edits
2010-10-30T01:25:38  <Zannick> no code paths edit the info
2010-10-30T01:25:59  <McLeopold> so, isn't the site open source somewhere?
2010-10-30T01:26:19  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-30T01:26:43  <raedwulf> i think it is simply "someone has to get round to do it"
2010-10-30T01:26:51  <raedwulf> d?
2010-10-30T01:27:06  <McLeopold> could I get a link?
2010-10-30T01:27:17  <sigh> @url repo
2010-10-30T01:27:17  <contestbot> sigh: repo = http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/

2010-10-30T01:28:08  <sigh> I haven't been paying attention for liek 2 weeks
2010-10-30T01:28:19  <sigh> have there been any major advancements in the bots?
2010-10-30T01:28:44  <raedwulf> they kick-ass
2010-10-30T01:28:46  <raedwulf> :P
2010-10-30T01:28:51  <sigh> haha
2010-10-30T01:29:30  <Zannick> well, they can't vote yet, but we're trying
2010-10-30T01:29:46  <sigh> :)
2010-10-30T01:29:50  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-10-30T01:29:57  <sigh> Zannick: have you got a bot up and running yet
2010-10-30T01:30:36  <Zannick> nope :P
2010-10-30T01:30:58  <Zannick> i am finishing up neutral grabbing, then all i have left is attack
2010-10-30T01:31:11  <Zannick> hopefully i can get something running before monday
2010-10-30T01:31:21  <Zannick> since my november has a lot less free time for this
2010-10-30T01:32:01  <sigh> cool, good luck :)
2010-10-30T01:32:14  <sigh> hmm... McLeopold still hasn't uploaded a new bot o_O
2010-10-30T01:32:33  <McLeopold> nope
2010-10-30T01:32:45  <McLeopold> I have huge performance issues.
2010-10-30T01:32:56  <sigh> ah :(
2010-10-30T01:32:56  <McLeopold> And life...
2010-10-30T01:32:59  <raedwulf> hehe, i have to finish off my bot and test it... wrote several hundred lines of code without testing
2010-10-30T01:33:04  <raedwulf> lmao... debugging fun
2010-10-30T01:33:22  <sigh> raedwulf: that's always dangerous
2010-10-30T01:33:54  <raedwulf> yea, unfortunately the code needed other code to test >.<
2010-10-30T01:34:15  <raedwulf> ok bbl run
2010-10-30T01:34:18  <sigh> cya
2010-10-30T01:34:48  <McLeopold> amstan: is the web site running on apache?

2010-10-30T01:35:19  <McLeopold> can you provide the apache config so I can run one local?
2010-10-30T01:35:25  <McLeopold> or is it in the trunk?
2010-10-30T01:35:32  <sigh> antimatroid: I think... I'm planning to start work on my bot again today
2010-10-30T01:35:42  <sigh> I still haven't started though :P
2010-10-30T01:35:55  <amstan> McLeopold: it's not a complicated site.. you just put them somewhere web accessible
2010-10-30T01:35:57  <antimatroid> i've been working hard and it sucks :P
2010-10-30T01:35:59  <amstan> nothing special done through apache
2010-10-30T01:36:03  <antimatroid> i have a couple of ideas in the works though
2010-10-30T01:36:16  <sigh> cool
2010-10-30T01:36:22  <antimatroid> and i found quite a few bugs with my internals
2010-10-30T01:36:29  <sigh> I need to remember my ideas again... I think I have them written down somewhere
2010-10-30T01:36:38  <sigh> ah, that's good... easy wins
2010-10-30T01:37:07  <sigh> is minimax working out?
2010-10-30T01:37:22  <antimatroid> hmmm, not really, but i think it's cause it's not set up well
2010-10-30T01:37:38  <antimatroid> i pretty much have things set up to try it in a zero sum simultaneous game
2010-10-30T01:37:46  <sigh> do you know if anyone else is using it to any degree of success?
2010-10-30T01:38:01  <antimatroid> no idea
2010-10-30T01:38:14  <McLeopold> JamesMG has something working, but not to great success
2010-10-30T01:38:28  <antimatroid> at the moment my tree is using a decision tree at each node for players to pick moves, and it just takes too long to get anywhere
2010-10-30T01:38:43  <sigh> yeah, I can imagine
2010-10-30T01:39:24  <antimatroid> i might take the tree back to single moves per node without decision trees
2010-10-30T01:39:34  <antimatroid> but i need the decision trees to generate pure strategies for zero sum games
2010-10-30T01:39:45  <antimatroid> i can't work out how else to do it, dp would be nice, but there's sooo much data
2010-10-30T01:40:16  <sigh> not sure exactly what you mean by all that :)
2010-10-30T01:40:55  <antimatroid> the idea then is to find pure strategy nash equilibria if they exist, otherwise use iterated strict dominance (and maybe have to throw out some other strategies) then use simplex for msne or some kind of numerical approximation
2010-10-30T01:41:22  <sigh> msne?
2010-10-30T01:41:30  <antimatroid> mixed strategy nash equilibria
2010-10-30T01:41:35  <sigh> ah, ok
2010-10-30T01:41:36  <antimatroid> so like rock paper scissors, you have to randomise
2010-10-30T01:41:44  <sigh> yeah, I know
2010-10-30T01:41:45  <antimatroid> otherwise you'll be pounced if they try to predict you
2010-10-30T01:41:49  <sigh> :)
2010-10-30T01:41:50  <antimatroid> yep :)
2010-10-30T01:42:15  <antimatroid> even in my minimax tree, if two nodes are equal if(getNum(0,1)) addChild :)
2010-10-30T01:42:24  <antimatroid> as best child**
2010-10-30T01:42:57  <sigh> I don't know what that means
2010-10-30T01:43:05  <antimatroid> i understand where minimax on tree's fails miserably now
2010-10-30T01:43:31  <sigh> where? other than the enormous branching factor?
2010-10-30T01:44:03  <antimatroid> no, if there's no saddle points then it doesn't work
2010-10-30T01:44:08  <antimatroid> but still spits out an answer for you
2010-10-30T01:44:18  <antimatroid> no saddle points means no pure strategy nash equilibria
2010-10-30T01:44:33  <antimatroid> and the other bot can exploit the fact that you're going to do that
2010-10-30T01:45:33  <sigh> ah ok
2010-10-30T01:46:14  <sigh> is this an issue that has come up in practice for this game, or just theoretical?
2010-10-30T01:47:26  <antimatroid> theoretical, but a1k0n kept saying it in the past and I couldn't work out where it happened
2010-10-30T01:47:40  <antimatroid> and such situations will happen, but it's probably not easy to exploit
2010-10-30T01:47:46  <sigh> i see
2010-10-30T01:47:57  <antimatroid> but i try to approximate optimal, not suboptimal :P
2010-10-30T01:48:07  <sigh> haha

2010-10-30T02:31:18  <superflit> it seems like fake sorry
2010-10-30T02:32:06  <amstan> ok....?
2010-10-30T02:33:30  <superflit> It fails on the credibility
2010-10-30T02:33:47  <superflit> if at least on the events of waterlook there was a link
2010-10-30T02:33:57  <superflit> that was ok
2010-10-30T02:34:10  <superflit> no links, no citation on google blog
2010-10-30T02:34:30  <amstan> you probably want to talk to jeff then
2010-10-30T02:35:13  <amstan> he's the one that wrote that text
2010-10-30T02:35:43  <amstan> as far as i see it, we host our own servers and past contestants are admins
2010-10-30T02:36:19  <superflit> the contest seems nice and well developed
2010-10-30T02:36:45  <superflit> but seriously, it lacks credibility. there is nothing on waterloo only the past contest
2010-10-30T02:36:58  <superflit> even the past contest page do not say anything about this contest
2010-10-30T02:37:15  <McLeopold> what does it mean to not be credible?
2010-10-30T02:37:18  <amstan> credibility for what though?
2010-10-30T02:37:20  <amstan> yeah..
2010-10-30T02:37:32  <superflit> if you use the name google
2010-10-30T02:37:32  <amstan> it's not like we're making people give us their credit card info
2010-10-30T02:37:41  <superflit> google seems to not be using your name...
2010-10-30T02:37:50  <amstan> that's their problem..
2010-10-30T02:37:53  <janzert> with 3800+ players I don't think we can withstand any more credibility
2010-10-30T02:37:53  <superflit> no you are just collecting cheap algo
2010-10-30T02:38:29  <Zannick> google blog is for important things
2010-10-30T02:38:31  <superflit> and doing research papers with free data
2010-10-30T02:38:44  <Zannick> maybe next time

2010-10-30T02:39:47  <Zannick> i did part of a research paper as an undergrad

2010-10-30T02:40:00  <McLeopold> our bots are really going to be used to control the next US airial drone strike?

2010-10-30T02:40:23  <Zannick> honestly, though, it wouldn't be the first fun someone has put something fun on the internet in order to get info for papers
2010-10-30T02:40:39  <Zannick> see also: luis von ahn and the esp game
2010-10-30T02:40:54  <Zannick> McLeopold: no, interstellar drone strikes

2010-10-30T02:41:11  <janzert> heh, well whoever's writing that paper I wish they'd come help run this thing :P
2010-10-30T02:41:14  <Zannick> as we are clearly designing such simulators
2010-10-30T02:41:22  <amstan> superflit: is that the paper you think was derived from the contest?
2010-10-30T02:41:41  <superflit> amstan: no yet, but the second will..
2010-10-30T02:42:15  <raedwulf> seriously, stop trolling >.<

2010-10-30T02:46:02  <McLeopold> you though you were going to have a comeback like, "no you mean felixcoto's", didn't you
2010-10-30T02:46:14  <janzert> sorry we don't log ip addresses of submitters :P
2010-10-30T02:46:31  <amstan> janzert: he meant intellectual property
2010-10-30T02:46:40  <amstan> not internet protocol address
2010-10-30T02:46:46  <janzert> yeah, I know
2010-10-30T02:46:47  <amstan> wait..
2010-10-30T02:46:52  <amstan> oh god
2010-10-30T02:46:56  * amstan is oblivious again
2010-10-30T02:46:57  <McLeopold> ?
2010-10-30T02:47:26  <amstan> McLeopold: you should team up with accoun, or something
2010-10-30T02:47:44  <McLeopold> My beard isn't long enough
2010-10-30T02:47:49  <amstan> lol
2010-10-30T02:47:50  <Zannick> i think we're done here
2010-10-30T02:48:29  <McLeopold> Zannick: did you ever figure out my r/p/s map?
2010-10-30T02:48:42  <Zannick> oh, i haven't looked at it since i left work
2010-10-30T02:48:46  <amstan> there's maps for that?

2010-10-30T02:49:15  <raedwulf> yea mega1 open sourcing after the contest? :D
2010-10-30T02:49:28  <mega1> sure, after I clean it up
2010-10-30T02:49:39  <amstan> so.. who's mega1? in the rankings?
2010-10-30T02:49:40  <mega1> provided that I'm motivated to do so

2010-10-30T02:50:11  <mega1> amstan: I had a "did not start/timeout/crashed" yesterday
2010-10-30T02:50:23  <McLeopold> mega1: I like your bot.  I"m going to mimic it.
2010-10-30T02:50:37  <Zannick> McLeopold: i do think it isn't very interesting since the minimum distance is 7 and players start with 7 ships
2010-10-30T02:51:04  <mega1> McLeopold: you need bug for bug compatibility, its strengths is in the bugs :-)
2010-10-30T02:51:15  <Zannick> oh wait
2010-10-30T02:51:21  <McLeopold> yeah, I know what you mean...
2010-10-30T02:51:25  <Zannick> no, yeah
2010-10-30T02:51:27  <amstan> mega1: hmm, not sure, you could ask janzert
2010-10-30T02:51:48  <Zannick> if player 1 launches toward his neutral and player 2 launches towards the same one
2010-10-30T02:51:55  <janzert> hmm?
2010-10-30T02:51:57  <Zannick> p2 snipes
2010-10-30T02:52:00  <McLeopold> yep
2010-10-30T02:52:15  <McLeopold> Change the starts to 1 growth, and it is probably the same.
2010-10-30T02:52:33  <Zannick> oh, they're 0 growth
2010-10-30T02:52:36  <Zannick> how did i miss that
2010-10-30T02:52:46  <McLeopold> I think you could make it more complecated until it became an official map.
2010-10-30T02:53:39  <Zannick> that...makes the game much more narrow
2010-10-30T02:53:47  <Zannick> since now there are only three moves
2010-10-30T02:54:12  <Zannick> go for 0, 3, or wait
2010-10-30T02:54:16  <McLeopold> but at least I've got proof there is no dominant strategy
2010-10-30T02:54:21  <Zannick> except waiting always loses to the first two
2010-10-30T02:54:31  <McLeopold> no, it wins against going for the far one
2010-10-30T02:54:42  <Zannick> oh, true
2010-10-30T02:55:02  <Zannick> yeah, that's rps
2010-10-30T02:55:04  <amstan> janzert: our cool guy on top here is not happy that he timed out for unknown reasons yesterday
2010-10-30T02:55:22  <McLeopold> amstan: I'm pretty mad about his loss too
2010-10-30T02:55:34  <amstan> hey, he's still first...
2010-10-30T02:55:45  <McLeopold> It cheapens my victory when I beat him. :P

2010-10-30T03:13:30  <McLeopold> ?
2010-10-30T03:13:34  <McLeopold> with what
2010-10-30T03:13:34  <antimatroid> beating mega1
2010-10-30T03:13:39  <McLeopold> thanks!
2010-10-30T03:14:22  <antimatroid> my bot wont make any moves on the first turn now
2010-10-30T03:14:23  <antimatroid> grrr
2010-10-30T03:14:25  <amstan> McLeopold: umm. what about attacking the enemy planet?
2010-10-30T03:15:16  <McLeopold> amstan: on the example map:
2010-10-30T03:15:23  <McLeopold> it's a zero grwoth
2010-10-30T03:16:20  <amstan> wait what?
2010-10-30T03:16:22  <amstan> aww
2010-10-30T03:16:24  <amstan> that's boring then
2010-10-30T03:16:53  <McLeopold> It's not suppose to be exciting.  It just proves there is no dominant strategy.
2010-10-30T03:17:11  <McLeopold> for some maps
2010-10-30T03:17:51  <antimatroid> what do you mean by not dominant? :P
2010-10-30T03:18:14  <amstan> antimatroid: no winning strategy
2010-10-30T03:18:23  <McLeopold> well, more generically, some maps favor aggressive attacks, some favor waiting more
2010-10-30T03:18:27  <antimatroid> there's technically no winning strategy on any map
2010-10-30T03:18:29  <McLeopold> this one just sits on the line
2010-10-30T03:18:42  <McLeopold> antimatroid, I think on some there are.
2010-10-30T03:18:56  <antimatroid> not if it's symmetric, there is a msne with equal payoffs to each player
2010-10-30T03:18:57  <McLeopold> I've got map30 pretty much nailed down
2010-10-30T03:19:20  <McLeopold> yes, most maps will be draw with perfect play
2010-10-30T03:19:39  <McLeopold> but with my example, it shows that there can be situations where it is random
2010-10-30T03:20:08  <McLeopold> there might be small locations in a larger map that resemble the r/p/s situation
2010-10-30T03:20:34  <antimatroid> yeah, didn't we go through that already?
2010-10-30T03:20:54  <antimatroid> my example with your correction does it
2010-10-30T03:20:56  <McLeopold> not with a fool proof example
2010-10-30T03:22:00  <McLeopold> was that the one with the 1 distance neutrals in the center?
2010-10-30T03:22:23  <antimatroid> yeah, but you can change the distances
2010-10-30T03:22:28  <antimatroid> they were picked arbitrarily
2010-10-30T03:22:48  <antimatroid> oh wait, yeah, you guys tore that apart didn't you? :P
2010-10-30T03:22:53  <McLeopold> it was close, but attacking the close neutral was dominate in that one
2010-10-30T03:23:12  <antimatroid> if one moves the middle neutrals further apart would it switch?
2010-10-30T03:23:27  <McLeopold> the change here is, the neutrals are far enough apart that you can't hop after picking the wrong planet
2010-10-30T03:23:49  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2010-10-30T03:23:56  <McLeopold> and you lose to many ships as well
2010-10-30T03:24:01  <antimatroid> i was going to say, just move one up and the other down
2010-10-30T03:24:23  <McLeopold> so, my example can fall apart with various changes
2010-10-30T03:24:36  <McLeopold> on one side, waiting becomes dominant, on the other attacking
2010-10-30T03:24:49  <McLeopold> A good bot will need to be able to see the difference
2010-10-30T03:25:14  <McLeopold> and mega1 has it down pretty good
2010-10-30T03:26:25  <antimatroid> my bot sucks at specifics, i need to work that out better
2010-10-30T03:26:32  <antimatroid> every time i try my brain just goes to mush
2010-10-30T03:27:51  <McLeopold> I use spreadsheets to help me think things through
2010-10-30T03:33:42  <raedwulf> i use a piece of paper
2010-10-30T03:33:45  <raedwulf> and a pen
2010-10-30T03:33:47  <raedwulf> lol
2010-10-30T03:33:53  <antimatroid> pacer*
2010-10-30T03:34:04  <McLeopold> white board and dry erase marker
2010-10-30T03:34:16  <raedwulf> don't have one handy :(
2010-10-30T03:34:23  <antimatroid> oh man, everyone is ruining me at having a whiteboard these days
2010-10-30T03:34:40  <antimatroid> like half my analysis class started talking about their whiteboards the other day
2010-10-30T03:34:47  <antimatroid> and i was like wtf, i am so behind the times
2010-10-30T03:35:12  <raedwulf> lol
2010-10-30T03:35:17  <McLeopold> get a tablet pc and show them up
2010-10-30T03:35:22  <raedwulf> ^^
2010-10-30T03:35:30  <raedwulf> yea wish that they weren't all so darn expensive
2010-10-30T03:36:07  <antimatroid> meh, i'm a maths student, computers are largely useless
2010-10-30T03:36:09  <Zannick> sweet
2010-10-30T03:36:14  <McLeopold> so, how do you brag about a whiteboard, other than you have one?
2010-10-30T03:36:14  <antimatroid> pure maths**
2010-10-30T03:36:22  <Zannick> my bot can now take over every planet then sit on its thumbs
2010-10-30T03:36:25  <antimatroid> that's bragging rights right there :P
2010-10-30T03:36:41  <Zannick> and defend while ragebot tries to chip away
2010-10-30T03:36:42  <raedwulf> antimatroid: in my computer maths lectures i wrote up maths in latex in realtime
2010-10-30T03:36:52  <McLeopold> Zannick: tcp!
2010-10-30T03:36:58  <McLeopold> i want to see
2010-10-30T03:36:59  <raedwulf> :P
2010-10-30T03:37:02  <Zannick> there's no attack code yet!
2010-10-30T03:37:06  <antimatroid> meh, latex documents are pretty, but i'm not going to type notes in it
2010-10-30T03:37:11  <McLeopold> how does it take a planet then?
2010-10-30T03:37:18  <raedwulf> i did, it was fine :P
2010-10-30T03:37:20  <Zannick> ragebot doesn't go for neutrals
2010-10-30T03:37:27  <raedwulf> you get pretty quick at it after a bit of practice
2010-10-30T03:37:38  <raedwulf> my main problem was my old laptop keyboard really failed
2010-10-30T03:37:42  <antimatroid> then when there's a diagram put on the board?
2010-10-30T03:37:48  <Zannick> i'm using "conquer" and "attack" to mean separate things wrt neutral or enemy
2010-10-30T03:37:50  <antimatroid> all my maths lectures are entirely off the whiteboard
2010-10-30T03:37:57  <raedwulf> antimatroid: then you scrabble for a piece of paper :P
2010-10-30T03:38:08  <raedwulf> didn't have any diagrams
2010-10-30T03:38:10  <McLeopold> so, attack would be pretty eash
2010-10-30T03:38:13  <raedwulf> in that course
2010-10-30T03:38:21  <McLeopold> ships + 1 + (distance * growth)
2010-10-30T03:38:25  <antimatroid> my analysis lecturer loves diagrams
2010-10-30T03:38:26  <raedwulf> module*
2010-10-30T03:38:30  <raedwulf> ah right
2010-10-30T03:38:54  <McLeopold> eash is the cool way to pronounce easy.  it's like "yesh"
2010-10-30T03:39:00  <raedwulf> well it does depend on the type of diagram
2010-10-30T03:39:32  <raedwulf> all my lecturers now use slides
2010-10-30T03:39:37  <raedwulf> which are available online
2010-10-30T03:39:46  <raedwulf> there's rarely anything extra
2010-10-30T03:39:56  <Zannick> that conquer function is nearly 200 lines long
2010-10-30T03:40:10  <McLeopold> copy paste?
2010-10-30T03:40:30  <Zannick> no, just too many separate components
2010-10-30T03:40:39  <antimatroid> McLeopold: are you still all heuristics
2010-10-30T03:40:47  <McLeopold> seriously?  a planet is a planet is a planet?
2010-10-30T03:40:48  <antimatroid> my quick heuristic bot last night did really well (t)
2010-10-30T03:40:51  <antimatroid> (h**)
2010-10-30T03:41:04  <antimatroid> for how fast i threw that together, compared to my tree bots
2010-10-30T03:41:06  <McLeopold> yes, all heuristics
2010-10-30T03:41:12  <Zannick> this isn't pure heuristic
2010-10-30T03:41:19  <antimatroid> it got you
2010-10-30T03:41:27  <Zannick> i am casing on things like which player is closest
2010-10-30T03:41:40  <McLeopold> isn't that still heuristics?
2010-10-30T03:41:44  <raedwulf> i need to grab a piece of paper for my heuristics i think
2010-10-30T03:41:59  <Zannick> in some manner of speaking
2010-10-30T03:42:02  <sigh> Zannick: I still don't understand what you were saying about player 23?
2010-10-30T03:42:12  <Zannick> there is no player 23
2010-10-30T03:42:15  <McLeopold> sigh, you behind by like, 2 hours
2010-10-30T03:42:31  <Zannick> somehow it thought player "23" was closest to the planet
2010-10-30T03:42:35  <sigh> nah, what he said about closest player just reminded me
2010-10-30T03:42:43  <McLeopold> oh
2010-10-30T03:42:55  <Zannick> i am amused at the errors
2010-10-30T03:43:19  <sigh> anyway, I reserve the right to raise dead conversations
2010-10-30T03:43:24  <McLeopold> Zannick: you must have a list of neutral planets?  what if an enemy planet just happened to be on the list?  would that be so bad?
2010-10-30T03:43:26  <antimatroid> tree bot? kind of, it uses heuristics for each players moves, but also generates a minimax tree and picks moves based off that
2010-10-30T03:43:48  <Zannick> i just discovered earlier that once the bot was satisfied the planet was well defended for the next turn, it would happily send ships off that planet
2010-10-30T03:44:00  <Zannick> bug in my budgeting >.<
2010-10-30T03:44:03  <Zannick> quickly fixed that
2010-10-30T03:44:23  <antimatroid> are people actually using 0-1 knapsack for first move?
2010-10-30T03:44:23  <Zannick> McLeopold: no, what is done is even more highly cased on what type of planet it is
2010-10-30T03:44:35  <antimatroid> doesn't seem like it really takes into account what the other player is then going to do to you to me
2010-10-30T03:44:39  <antimatroid> or your position strength etc.
2010-10-30T03:44:43  <sigh> antimatroid: according to the forum like a month ago, yes
2010-10-30T03:45:02  <Zannick> position strength? this is first turn, remember
2010-10-30T03:45:23  <antimatroid> yeah, isn't that when it's most important
2010-10-30T03:45:32  <sigh> I think he mean the pos. strength of the planets you are aquiring
2010-10-30T03:45:35  <sigh> oh, ok
2010-10-30T03:45:37  <McLeopold> map7, turn 1, take the center
2010-10-30T03:45:43  <antimatroid> really?
2010-10-30T03:45:44  <Zannick> well, you can factor that into your planet value
2010-10-30T03:46:12  <antimatroid> i have that open right next to the window already, i think you might be right
2010-10-30T03:47:06  <antimatroid> wait, if they take their 12 first move and you take middle, what then?
2010-10-30T03:47:56  <McLeopold> um...profit?
2010-10-30T03:48:08  <antimatroid> wouldn't you lose?
2010-10-30T03:48:57  <McLeopold> well, you would, but not me
2010-10-30T03:49:00  <McLeopold> :)
2010-10-30T03:49:06  <sigh> haha
2010-10-30T03:49:10  <antimatroid> but why not?
2010-10-30T03:49:18  <antimatroid> what moves are you planning to make following that?
2010-10-30T03:49:42  <McLeopold> it depends on the enemy
2010-10-30T03:49:54  <McLeopold> I'm just saying good position is taking the center
2010-10-30T03:50:04  <McLeopold> and you can determine that on turn 1
2010-10-30T03:50:10  <Zannick> wow, i think i might have a working bot tomorrow
2010-10-30T03:50:13  <antimatroid> they send 13 first move and you send 38, you have no other information about the opoonent, what do you do?
2010-10-30T03:50:15  <Zannick> but i need to break now
2010-10-30T03:50:30  <McLeopold> let me get my whiteboard...
2010-10-30T03:50:54  <antimatroid> i'm download that better visualizer that lets me play my bot
2010-10-30T03:51:07  <McLeopold> delt0r's?
2010-10-30T03:51:33  <antimatroid> yeah
2010-10-30T03:51:39  <antimatroid> i know i know, should have already
2010-10-30T03:51:42  <McLeopold> I have trouble beating RageBot in human mode.
2010-10-30T03:52:36  <antimatroid> i didn't think it would be that hard
2010-10-30T03:53:13  <sigh> RageBot has a human mode!
2010-10-30T03:53:17  <sigh> :P

2010-10-30T04:16:59  <McLeopold> hop to the 4+2
2010-10-30T04:17:03  <McLeopold> then decide
2010-10-30T04:18:34  <antimatroid> i don't thnk that works either, i think you need to take your 12
2010-10-30T04:19:12  <antimatroid> can i change the send ratio?
2010-10-30T04:19:41  <antimatroid> yeah okay i see
2010-10-30T04:21:23  <amstan> McLeopold: so.. hold on
2010-10-30T04:21:31  <amstan> McLeopold: if you have any map with 0 growth
2010-10-30T04:21:36  <amstan> you'll have same problem
2010-10-30T04:21:52  <amstan> because there will never be any reason to expand
2010-10-30T04:22:02  <amstan> makes the game uninteresting
2010-10-30T04:22:12  <McLeopold> amstan: what if the growth is 1, it still works
2010-10-30T04:22:31  <McLeopold> what if the middle is collectively worth much more than the starting position
2010-10-30T04:22:31  <amstan> not if there's waiting involved between moves

2010-10-30T05:35:51  <antimatroid> it would be cool if the home planets didn't always have the maximum growth rate
2010-10-30T05:36:52  <Error323> why
2010-10-30T05:37:09  <antimatroid> cause at present you pretty much always have the dominant strategy to defend it
2010-10-30T05:37:43  <Commandir> and perhaps several starting planets
2010-10-30T05:37:45  <antimatroid> you could have close starting matches with smaller home growth rates where it's better to give up that planet and move to another one
2010-10-30T05:37:59  <antimatroid> my bot could handle several starting planets

2010-10-30T10:21:55  <Frontier> antimatroid: I don't know about the band of radius idea, but to me it looks like all games people complain about show a higher production over the last 50 or so turns for the player who lost. While the winner could have turned the match he was about to loose around, he didn't attempt to in such a long time and lost his advantage. It is fair to say that he lost 'by points' as in boxing.
2010-10-30T10:26:43  <Frontier> While the game rules must not become complicated it would be good to see a solution. How about this: IF a player has more production than the other, continue until he also has more ships. Any comments?
2010-10-30T10:28:50  <raedwulf> the limit of turns pus another dimension to the game
2010-10-30T10:29:10  <raedwulf> imo, it requires better AI to handle it
2010-10-30T10:29:35  <raedwulf> s/pus/puts
2010-10-30T10:29:45  <antimatroid> it just means you need to try and execute wins faster

2010-10-30T10:30:19  <antimatroid> yep
2010-10-30T10:31:04  <raedwulf> i had to draw some circles and triangles on a piece of paper to work out my strategy
2010-10-30T10:31:12  <raedwulf> im still unsure on how to pick to attack
2010-10-30T10:31:23  <raedwulf> but i think somehow inversing my heuristic for defense should work
2010-10-30T10:31:51  <antimatroid> yeah pen and paper help
2010-10-30T10:32:15  <antimatroid> my "moves" involve multiple sources and a single destination, and i might send many fleeets from a single planet at different points in time
2010-10-30T10:32:27  <raedwulf> yea
2010-10-30T10:32:32  <raedwulf> pooling resources
2010-10-30T10:33:01  <antimatroid> and then a pure strategy is just a vector of such moves
2010-10-30T10:33:10  <raedwulf> yep
2010-10-30T10:33:15  <raedwulf> that was my initial idea
2010-10-30T10:33:15  <antimatroid> then mixed strategy assigns probability distribution over them, now i need solutions :()
2010-10-30T10:33:20  <antimatroid> :)*
2010-10-30T10:33:34  <raedwulf> i've generalised the problem somewhat

2010-10-30T10:54:48  <phreeza> the simplest way would be do the diagonal first and then do the next entry with inices (i,j) = argmax_i , argmin_j P_ij
2010-10-30T10:54:54  <antimatroid> decision trees (these work best for me), i make one move per child at each node, then make moves off new information
2010-10-30T10:54:54  <antimatroid> game trees, each player makes one move per turn and state doesn't increment, keep playing each other in that turn, pick moves from an entire path
2010-10-30T10:54:54  <antimatroid> each player makes all their moves for the turn at each node (use decision tree? it's slow) and state increments every second layer
2010-10-30T10:54:54  <antimatroid> payoff matrix, each player's pure strategy is a vector of moves and payoffs are done based off state from both players pure strategies
2010-10-30T10:55:14  <antimatroid> oh you want to solve it? you can use iterated strict dominance to reduce the size
2010-10-30T10:55:22  *** wvdschel <wvdschel!~wim@unaffiliated/yukito> has joined #aichallenge
2010-10-30T10:56:19  <antimatroid> minimax is fairly efficient on zero sum payoff matrices if you've kept your payoff function zero sum?
2010-10-30T10:56:50  <antimatroid> but there might not be any saddle points, at which point you need another choice, even then just playing a ne isn't going to always do you well
2010-10-30T10:57:25  <antimatroid> i can expand on anything there if you want?
2010-10-30T10:57:36  <phreeza> cool, let me read
2010-10-30T10:57:39  <antimatroid> one thing i wouldn't mind playing around with yet and haven't worked out is some kind of minimax regret
2010-10-30T10:58:07  <phreeza> what do you mean exactly by pure strategy?
2010-10-30T10:58:08  <antimatroid> which sort of takes into account how much you regret not making a different move for each of theirs
2010-10-30T10:58:28  <antimatroid> pure strategy are the actions you have available to you, a mixed strategy is just assigning probabilities over them
2010-10-30T10:58:53  <antimatroid> so in rock, paper scissors, those are your pure strategies, a mixed strategy is saying that for any game you will play each with a 1/3 probability
2010-10-30T10:58:56  <phreeza> ok like game theory
2010-10-30T10:58:59  <phreeza> yep
2010-10-30T10:59:04  <antimatroid> yep
2010-10-30T10:59:12  <phreeza> i thought maybe you mean something higher level
2010-10-30T10:59:19  <phreeza> like attack planet, snipe
2010-10-30T10:59:24  <antimatroid> i'm just throwing whatever I can at it from game theory at this point
2010-10-30T11:00:02  <antimatroid> mega1: have you done things any differently :P
2010-10-30T11:00:19  <antimatroid> other than your magical killTheOponnent() function
2010-10-30T11:00:20  <mega1> oops, missed a page of conversation
2010-10-30T11:00:30  <phreeza> my bot does something similar to what you called game trees
2010-10-30T11:00:52  <phreeza> but its really dumb... i think my move generation is really weak
2010-10-30T11:00:54  <antimatroid> which one? one move per node? or multiple moves per node and multiple "time" stages?
2010-10-30T11:00:56  <phreeza> its very random
2010-10-30T11:01:10  <phreeza> so a node for me is one players moves
2010-10-30T11:01:10  <antimatroid> yeah, i can't get that to work at all
2010-10-30T11:01:23  <antimatroid> my decision tree bot always does best, but it makes some really stupid moves
2010-10-30T11:01:23  <phreeza> so it only gets evaluated every other layer
2010-10-30T11:02:05  <phreeza> and for payoff, i advance state at the leaf nodes until there are no more fleets
2010-10-30T11:02:08  <antimatroid> to make my zero sum game, i use a decision tree for both players and pull moves from all terminal nodes (or best x) as pure strategies, then generate the game matrix from that
2010-10-30T11:02:24  <phreeza> and then take the standard, projected fleets at turn 200
2010-10-30T11:02:26  <antimatroid> yeah i do that, and possibly even "play nodes" where players just defend and attack
2010-10-30T11:02:51  <phreeza> ah but how do you choose what to attack?
2010-10-30T11:02:52  <antimatroid> i think i need to refine my underlying choices more though
2010-10-30T11:03:01  <antimatroid> pick move functions
2010-10-30T11:03:10  <antimatroid> each move has multiple sources and one destination
2010-10-30T11:03:25  <phreeza> okay
2010-10-30T11:03:33  <phreeza> interesting
2010-10-30T11:03:38  <phreeza> i have that the other way roun

2010-10-30T11:04:35  <phreeza> hm and the payoff matrix, you have sets of moves like that as the indices?
2010-10-30T11:04:45  <antimatroid> i start with a planet i want to take, then move time outwards, and add usable ships from me inside that time limit, if it goes above what i need to make a decent move, i return that
2010-10-30T11:04:59  <antimatroid> yeah, each pure strategy is just a vector<Move>
2010-10-30T11:05:36  <phreeza> aha. thats what i have for now, too... but i think i want to move it to the next layer of abstraction
2010-10-30T11:05:45  <phreeza> define a hierarchy of goals
2010-10-30T11:05:55  <antimatroid> so hard
2010-10-30T11:05:59  <phreeza> and then generate pure strategies based on that
2010-10-30T11:06:07  <antimatroid> i've considered trying to partition the graph, but can't work out a good way to do it

2010-10-30T11:06:57  <antimatroid> yeah

2010-10-30T11:07:26  <phreeza> yea the game tree is a graph though too ;) strictly speaking
2010-10-30T11:07:43  <antimatroid> yeah, noncyclic :P
2010-10-30T11:08:09  <phreeza> some people use minimum spanning trees i think

2010-10-30T11:08:54  <antimatroid> the only real reason (i think) for enforcing trees on games is for perfect recall
2010-10-30T11:08:59  <phreeza> they do a good job at preventing overextending themselves from what i've seen
2010-10-30T11:09:24  <phreeza> perfect recall?
2010-10-30T11:09:37  <antimatroid> take any node, you know the exact path of play to get there
2010-10-30T11:10:29  <phreeza> ah
2010-10-30T11:10:36  <antimatroid> the problem with doing gametree's with this is it's a simultaneous game and one doesn't really take account of the imperfect information when using minimax
2010-10-30T11:10:40  <antimatroid> well, one of the problems
2010-10-30T11:11:04  <antimatroid> THE problem is probably how many god damn possible moves there are
2010-10-30T11:11:13  <phreeza> yup...
2010-10-30T11:11:31  <phreeza> combinatorial explosion
2010-10-30T11:11:40  <antimatroid> games are amazing like that
2010-10-30T11:11:41  <phreeza> is that the english word?
2010-10-30T11:12:07  <antimatroid> even the game tree for 4x4 tic tac toe is HUGE

2010-10-30T11:23:12  <Commandir> ah right, hehe
2010-10-30T11:23:15  <antimatroid> minimise the distance to first filled square?
2010-10-30T11:23:19  <antimatroid> across rows?
2010-10-30T11:23:37  <antimatroid> and rotate the object till found?
2010-10-30T11:23:45  <antimatroid> maybe even generate a function to transform that?
2010-10-30T11:23:54  <phreeza> hash field + field' + field '' + field '''
2010-10-30T11:23:55  <phreeza> ?
2010-10-30T11:23:55  <Commandir> what you can do is rotate evertyhing before you hash
2010-10-30T11:24:01  <Commandir> but that could be costly of course..
2010-10-30T11:24:12  <antimatroid> rotation is slow, i'd use a function to find the rotation that minises it
2010-10-30T11:24:14  <Commandir> find a normal form
2010-10-30T11:24:17  <antimatroid> then apply the right transformation
2010-10-30T11:24:20  <antimatroid> that'd do it
2010-10-30T11:24:36  <antimatroid> just search out from each corner to find min distance to player 1 i think?
2010-10-30T11:24:44  <antimatroid> may have issues when that conflicts

2010-10-30T11:25:37  <phreeza> i like it too but i'm a total amateur
2010-10-30T11:25:45  <Commandir> but what you can do to save time, is to keep say 8 instances of the board
2010-10-30T11:25:51  <antimatroid> Commandir: the point is to blow the dimensions out and solve larger and larger games
2010-10-30T11:25:55  <Commandir> and just update them each time you make a move

2010-10-30T11:29:05  <antimatroid> non zero sum?
2010-10-30T11:29:17  <phreeza> simple way for the hashing: calulate all 8 hashes, including mirrored, then sort them lexically
2010-10-30T11:29:31  <antimatroid> writing a function to get all pure subgame perfect nash equilibria for n-player extensive form games was a total pain in the ass
2010-10-30T11:29:33  <phreeza> not super efficient but does the trick
2010-10-30T11:29:53  <Commandir> you can do it incrementally
2010-10-30T11:30:07  <antimatroid> do what? :P
2010-10-30T11:30:11  <Commandir> chess and go engines use zobrist hashing
2010-10-30T11:30:27  <Commandir> that way you only need to xor one value each time you make a move

2010-10-30T11:31:46  <Commandir> in zobrist hashing you have a random number for each game piece for each position on the board, and each move you simply xor the hash value
2010-10-30T11:34:20  <Commandir> which also means you get a very nice distribution in your hash table

2010-10-30T12:39:10  <Zannick> janzert: pong
2010-10-30T12:39:37  <janzert> hi, working on getting golang setup and trying to get the compile_anything stuff correct for it
2010-10-30T12:40:32  <janzert> it basically compiles sorta like java, with one command taking all the .go files and producing an intermediate
2010-10-30T12:40:46  <Zannick> afaik it should work out of the box
2010-10-30T12:40:47  <janzert> then the linker takes the intermediate file and produces the executable
2010-10-30T12:40:54  <janzert> it's not :/
2010-10-30T12:41:10  <Zannick> :/
2010-10-30T12:41:18  <janzert> it seems right now compile_anything expects the first command to produce MyBot directly
2010-10-30T12:42:05  <Zannick> oh, i'm an idiot
2010-10-30T12:42:17  <janzert> I think it just needs a second ExternalCompiler line maybe?
2010-10-30T12:42:21  <Zannick> yeah, the language is missing its second step
2010-10-30T12:42:32  <janzert> ok
2010-10-30T12:43:19  <janzert> but there is no glob for the second so just something like  ([""], ExternalCompiler(comp_args["Go"][1])) right?
2010-10-30T12:44:06  <Zannick> yeah
2010-10-30T12:44:44  <janzert> thanks, just wanted to work through it with you to make sure I was understanding it correctly

2010-10-30T13:48:03  <demerzel_> man i cannot figure out why my 'available ships' works but then zeroes out before i can use it lol
2010-10-30T13:49:53  <demerzel_> debugging future states is going to be fun too - already see one bug for some reason it sees turn 200 as the optimal turn to attack lol
2010-10-30T13:50:50  <Mathnerd314> sounds like your problem is using a language that allows side effects :p
2010-10-30T13:53:12  <demerzel_> except this language is so amazingly fast it's blowing my mind
2010-10-30T13:53:38  <demerzel_> i calc state for every planet every turn and scan each one for a ratio then run it back through and calc mine/enemy fleet max
2010-10-30T13:53:46  <demerzel_> turns take <.001s lol
2010-10-30T13:54:34  <demerzel_> i might actually be able to achieve my dream of a true minmax bot in c++ after all
2010-10-30T13:54:37  <demerzel_> c# was hitting the limit
2010-10-30T13:55:25  <phreeza> kinda funny that you say youre an optimization freak and just came across c++ now :P
2010-10-30T13:55:33  <demerzel_> well i haven't touched it in forever
2010-10-30T13:55:53  <demerzel_> i mean i played with it before i ever became a pro dev and none of my jobs ever let me use it
2010-10-30T13:56:17  <demerzel_> when you just play with it is a lot different than having a structured idea of what you want

2010-10-30T13:59:16  <demerzel_> isn't it using the java vm
2010-10-30T13:59:25  <phreeza> better bytecode optimizations? might also come down to coding style
2010-10-30T14:00:07  <janzert> remember the second line on the page "No. Which programming language implementations have the fastest benchmark programs?" :P
2010-10-30T14:00:21  <demerzel_> too bad they didn't bench js
2010-10-30T14:00:21  <phreeza> actually scala and java have almos6t the same medan
2010-10-30T14:00:24  <phreeza> madian
2010-10-30T14:00:27  <demerzel_> i almost did a js bot just to be esoteric
2010-10-30T14:00:33  <phreeza> go is pretty slow!
2010-10-30T14:00:37  <demerzel_> what stopped me is i have no idea what it uses for stdin/out
2010-10-30T14:00:45  <phreeza> i thought it was a fast language
2010-10-30T14:00:56  <phreeza> hehe document.write?
2010-10-30T14:00:58  <phreeza> no idea
2010-10-30T14:01:34  <demerzel_> holy shit python really is slow as hell i thought it was exaggerated
2010-10-30T14:01:40  <demerzel_> now i really don't understand its popularity
2010-10-30T14:02:15  <janzert> running speed is very rarely a factor in real life
2010-10-30T14:02:22  <phreeza> python is the most pleasant language to code in
2010-10-30T14:02:46  <janzert> most of the time in most programs is spent waiting on I/O anyway
2010-10-30T14:02:48  <demerzel_> i know almost all the c(whatevers), initial BASIC/PASCAL and php/js
2010-10-30T14:02:55  <demerzel_> and python is totally alien to me
2010-10-30T14:03:00  <phreeza> its used for stuff where developer time is the bottleneck, not computer time
2010-10-30T14:03:15  <phreeza> you should give it a try
2010-10-30T14:03:20  <phreeza> its an eye opener
2010-10-30T14:03:25  <demerzel_> if i just wanted implicit typing and foreach i'd use VB.NET lol
2010-10-30T14:03:52  <demerzel_> i really don't understand its draw - how is it easier than say C#
2010-10-30T14:04:12  <demerzel_> ignoring the fact the syntax is totally alien to me
2010-10-30T14:04:45  <demerzel_> not to mention the python console while nice doesn't even begin to compare to vs debugging
2010-10-30T14:04:51  <phreeza> ive never used c++ but the whole language just feels right. the way OO is done for example
2010-10-30T14:05:09  <p4p4> rot12("ada")
2010-10-30T14:05:21  <demerzel_> altho i guess they made some variant for vs now
2010-10-30T14:05:30  <demerzel_> i thought ada was long dead
2010-10-30T14:05:34  <demerzel_> had no idea it was still around
2010-10-30T14:05:55  <demerzel_> grouped it with COBOL and PASCAL as just obsolete
2010-10-30T14:06:23  <mega1> do you guys know map ids with the starting bases close?
2010-10-30T14:06:27  <phreeza> lots of legacy systems around... i think you can make a good living as a cobol guru

2010-10-30T14:15:00  <demerzel_> sure
2010-10-30T14:15:09  <Bobng> How much do you pay for it and what specs is it?
2010-10-30T14:15:09  <demerzel_> altho my knowledge of linux is functional at best
2010-10-30T14:15:25  <Bobng> Oh, its only about the price. Me and a friend want to start selling VPS servers
2010-10-30T14:15:32  <demerzel_> i pay $25/mo for a 1mbps unmetered, 2gig ram and 400gig space
2010-10-30T14:15:36  <demerzel_> it's a cheap deal tho
2010-10-30T14:15:39  <demerzel_> i hunted for a while
2010-10-30T14:15:47  <demerzel_> normally that setup is around 50
2010-10-30T14:15:58  <phreeza> Bobng i think thats a very competitive market... linode rackspace amazon...
2010-10-30T14:16:10  <Bobng> Yeah demerzel_, that is a pretty good deal
2010-10-30T14:16:12  <demerzel_> yea i know the guys i get from are reselling
2010-10-30T14:16:20  <demerzel_> but idc really
2010-10-30T14:16:22  <Bobng> Well could you take a look at the prices we drew up?
2010-10-30T14:16:23  <Bobng> http://69.42.214.138:85/VPSForge.com/services.php
2010-10-30T14:16:48  <Bobng> phreeza: true, or though amazon has a different pricing structure and market
2010-10-30T14:17:07  <Bobng> the plans in the link seem to beat 99% of other plans I have seen
2010-10-30T14:17:09  <demerzel_> that looks like a good deal
2010-10-30T14:17:12  <Bobng> feel free to correct me though
2010-10-30T14:17:13  <demerzel_> altho i don't see what the line speed is
2010-10-30T14:17:31  <phreeza> yea they seem quite cheap
2010-10-30T14:17:36  <demerzel_> there are 2 types of vps customers imo
2010-10-30T14:17:46  <demerzel_> the ones that will never use it and the others that want unmetered for as cheap as possible

2010-10-30T14:18:04  <Bobng> demerzel_: the line speed is in the table
2010-10-30T14:18:12  <demerzel_> it says port speed
2010-10-30T14:18:12  <Bobng> "Port speed", the line speed overall is 2gb/s
2010-10-30T14:18:21  <phreeza> on a vps nobody stops you from hammering the cpu right?
2010-10-30T14:18:24  <demerzel_> ah shared then
2010-10-30T14:18:34  <Bobng> nope phreeza
2010-10-30T14:18:39  <demerzel_> most vps set a hard limit on how much cpu you can use
2010-10-30T14:18:41  <Bobng> but there is a token credit system
2010-10-30T14:18:43  <demerzel_> ie 50% or whatever
2010-10-30T14:18:45  <Bobng> we dont set a limit
2010-10-30T14:18:48  <phreeza> ah ok
2010-10-30T14:18:49  <Bobng> we give you priority
2010-10-30T14:19:12  <Bobng> so if the CPU is unused you can use all of it, but if a larger plan is using it then you get reduced priority over that one
2010-10-30T14:19:21  <demerzel_> yea the main reason mine is cheap is actually cuz of the ram
2010-10-30T14:19:28  <demerzel_> i don't get why 1gig->2gig is a 3x increase
2010-10-30T14:19:32  <demerzel_> not picking on you that's a vps standard
2010-10-30T14:19:44  <Bobng> yeah, well they dont sell
2010-10-30T14:19:59  <Bobng> but idk
2010-10-30T14:20:06  <Bobng> ram is the premium I guess
2010-10-30T14:20:24  <phreeza> whats a seedbox?
2010-10-30T14:20:26  <demerzel_> mega1: what do you use to test with outside of tcp
2010-10-30T14:20:36  <Bobng> well, if this does take off the ground and we do start selling I was going to donate a super instance or two to #aichallenge
2010-10-30T14:20:40  <Bobng> in return for some publicity.
2010-10-30T14:20:44  <demerzel_> i used iouri_'s visualizer for a while till i realized it had bugs causing me to hunt for nonexistent bugs in mine
2010-10-30T14:20:49  <Bobng> phreeza: it does what it says on the tin - used for torrents.
2010-10-30T14:20:56  <phreeza> ahh
2010-10-30T14:21:03  <Bobng> you get a restricted shell to run rtorrent
2010-10-30T14:21:04  <mega1> demerzel_: shell scripts and http://github.com/albertz/planet_wars-cpp.git
2010-10-30T14:21:06  <Bobng> and lots of HD space.
2010-10-30T14:21:17  <phreeza> ok
2010-10-30T14:21:24  <demerzel_> mega1: dammit i'm on a windows machine lol
2010-10-30T14:21:32  <demerzel_> albertz scares me a little or i would get his
2010-10-30T14:21:50  <phreeza> so you'll get a ton of dmca notices then i guess?
2010-10-30T14:22:07  <demerzel_> idk why i haven't built my own by now, i've written turn logic so many times now i could do it blindfolded in 5 languages

2010-10-30T14:22:58  <janzert> so what does everyone here think about adding a comment sent to bots that gives the turns remaining in the game something like "# : turns_remaining 123"
2010-10-30T14:23:00  <demerzel_> idk just way too eager and bad english lol
2010-10-30T14:23:04  <demerzel_> i'm paranoid tho

2010-10-30T14:25:13  <phreeza> is that for people with 640x480
2010-10-30T14:25:20  <Bobng> yep :)
2010-10-30T14:25:25  <demerzel_> i should write a barebones game engine i think
2010-10-30T14:25:29  <phreeza> or some SEO stuff?
2010-10-30T14:25:31  <demerzel_> yea your ui is pretty nice
2010-10-30T14:25:34  <Bobng> I showed it to someone and they didn't see the seedboxes
2010-10-30T14:25:38  <Bobng> they were like "where is it??"
2010-10-30T14:25:40  <phreeza> haha
2010-10-30T14:25:45  <Bobng> so I thought I would put a link just in case.
2010-10-30T14:25:50  <phreeza> ab testing ftw
2010-10-30T14:26:21  <Bobng> phreeza: DMCA shouldn't worry us
2010-10-30T14:26:26  <Bobng> if all our users use private trackers
2010-10-30T14:26:31  <Bobng> else yeah we will have to shut them down
2010-10-30T14:26:55  <phreeza> aha, i'm not really familiar with all the torrent stuff.
2010-10-30T14:27:18  <demerzel_> i have torrented for almost a decade lol
2010-10-30T14:27:34  <demerzel_> i wish i understood freenet tho it's too complicated for me
2010-10-30T14:27:45  <demerzel_> tor is nice but way too damn slow
2010-10-30T14:27:52  <phreeza> i used to, until our student residence got raided that scared me hehe
2010-10-30T14:28:08  <demerzel_> install truecrypt problem solved
2010-10-30T14:28:15  <phreeza> now i use megaupload
2010-10-30T14:28:18  <phreeza> etc
2010-10-30T14:28:28  <demerzel_> that's way more trackable than torrents
2010-10-30T14:28:35  <demerzel_> just set your torrent port to 80 ;)
2010-10-30T14:28:39  <phreeza> yea but youre not liable
2010-10-30T14:28:57  <phreeza> in germany they get you for seeding
2010-10-30T14:29:01  <phreeza> not downloading
2010-10-30T14:29:03  <phreeza> afaik
2010-10-30T14:29:04  <demerzel_> someone debug my code for me
2010-10-30T14:29:15  <demerzel_> i am unmotivated but i want a semi-working bot :(
2010-10-30T14:31:04  <demerzel_> i feel bad using the tcp server as a debugger lol
2010-10-30T14:32:09  <fluffluff> janzert: seems better to permanently fix the turn limit at say 200 in the specs imho
2010-10-30T14:36:28  <demerzel_> yea if you change it it will jack a lot of stuff up
2010-10-30T14:36:35  <demerzel_> for me anyway lol
2010-10-30T14:36:41  <demerzel_> or rather if it's dynamic
2010-10-30T14:36:46  <demerzel_> i can change the constant obv
2010-10-30T14:37:02  <janzert> demerzel_: I don't think there is any chance it will become dynamic
2010-10-30T14:37:15  <demerzel_> well that would be the point of a turns remaining wouldn't it
2010-10-30T14:37:19  <janzert> but there is some debate about changing the length
2010-10-30T14:37:39  <janzert> it let's you know what the length of the game actually is
2010-10-30T14:38:33  <janzert> it should always be decreasing by 1 every move
2010-10-30T14:38:55  <demerzel_> right but why would you need to state it
2010-10-30T14:39:08  <demerzel_> i assume most bots that knwo what turn it is also know how many are left
2010-10-30T14:39:09  <janzert> because it might start at 200 currently and 300 later
2010-10-30T14:39:22  <demerzel_> well that would be dynamic then
2010-10-30T14:39:23  <janzert> later as in a different game
2010-10-30T14:40:13  <janzert> it is just more in line with the protocol 'philosophy' to send it every move instead of just at the beginning of the game
2010-10-30T14:40:37  *** perror <perror!~fleury@aldebaran.labri.fr> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye all !)
2010-10-30T14:41:02  <janzert> it preserves the full game state being given at every move that way
2010-10-30T14:41:21  <demerzel_> ah i see ok
2010-10-30T14:42:07  <demerzel_> wouldn't hurt anything to add it iirc the starter packs would just ignore it
2010-10-30T14:42:11  <demerzel_> as would mine
2010-10-30T14:42:24  <janzert> right, all the starter packs will ignore
2010-10-30T14:42:31  <janzert> as will any bot that follows the spec
2010-10-30T14:42:52  <demerzel_> just make it a T xxx after planets
2010-10-30T14:43:05  <fluffluff> but is it really worth mucking around with halfway through the contest?
2010-10-30T14:43:09  <janzert> that could break bots that follow the spec
2010-10-30T14:43:14  <demerzel_> why is that
2010-10-30T14:43:21  <demerzel_> it just looks for P or F or go\n
2010-10-30T14:43:28  <demerzel_> it's none of those so it would just pass by it
2010-10-30T14:43:52  <janzert> the spec doesn't say anything about ignoring unexpected lines
2010-10-30T14:44:12  <janzert> the spec does give a comment line we can reuse for this information
2010-10-30T14:44:25  <demerzel_> oh god don't do that just add a sentence to the spec ffs lol
2010-10-30T14:44:33  <janzert> i.e. anything starting with a # should already be ignored
2010-10-30T14:44:56  <janzert> and we can do "# :" for any additional 'meta' information
2010-10-30T14:44:59  <demerzel_> that would be way more annoying
2010-10-30T14:45:10  <demerzel_> to have to check only the first planet or whatever for a # then whatever
2010-10-30T14:45:13  <demerzel_> than just a T xxx
2010-10-30T14:45:14  <janzert> that's the only way this will happen I'm sure
2010-10-30T14:45:33  <janzert> I know there are bots that will die with a T xxx
2010-10-30T14:45:53  <demerzel_> well none of the starter packs and we're talking like 30 seconds of code
2010-10-30T14:46:16  <demerzel_> iirc the starter packs dont' keep track of turns at all
2010-10-30T14:46:18  <janzert> gotta run, time to eat
2010-10-30T14:46:22  <janzert> nope they don't
2010-10-30T14:46:30  <demerzel_> nothing broken then

2010-10-30T15:32:17  <Mathnerd314> but I'm guessing that getting languages working at all (e..g Go) is going to take more priority than fixing bugs
2010-10-30T15:35:04  <Mathnerd314> alternately, we could have switched to CPU time back in the beginning of the contest...
2010-10-30T15:35:11  <mega1> I'm more worried about not knowing anything about how they plan to run the final tournament.
2010-10-30T15:35:23  <mega1> switch cpu back??

2010-10-30T15:38:36  <mega1> but maybe it's the compilation
2010-10-30T15:38:55  <mega1> are the cloud servers different from server #0?

2010-10-30T15:51:50  <demerzel_> if it was wall clock time 0.1s then that would make no sense at all
2010-10-30T15:51:51  <Mathnerd314> mega1: if you were doing some sort of minimax search, you would be looking at the orders you could give, and could quickly return the best set of orders found and print them out.

2010-10-30T16:37:18  * Todd200 trying to build his first decient bot
2010-10-30T16:38:35  <Todd200> its a bot mostly based on guessing the future and acting accordingly, it wont have any other strategy for now
2010-10-30T16:40:50  <fluffluff> gotta start somewhere
2010-10-30T16:41:35  <mega1> not much going on on tcp right now
2010-10-30T16:42:09  <mega1> anyone up for sparring?
2010-10-30T16:42:59  <Naktibalda_> Todd200: usually bot has a strategy and doesn't try to guess future
2010-10-30T16:43:54  <rangzen> Todd200: and a lot doesn't have a stategy and doesn't try to guess future
2010-10-30T16:44:20  <Todd200> true
2010-10-30T16:44:37  <Naktibalda_> oh, I thought that even RageBot has a strategy
2010-10-30T16:45:01  <rangzen> Todd200: but the ~top500, they all have future guessing and have strategy
2010-10-30T16:45:19  <rangzen> and top50 have A LOT of strategy
2010-10-30T16:45:22  <Todd200> its more of a proof of concept to tie into its battle strategy later
2010-10-30T16:45:35  <Todd200> im 14, ill go slowly
2010-10-30T16:46:09  <Todd200> most of top 10 use supply trains
2010-10-30T16:46:39  <rangzen> With the time of translation in my head I thought that you rank 14 :) With no strategy, whoua!
2010-10-30T16:47:02  <Todd200> lol, im rank 2300 or so
2010-10-30T16:47:25  <rangzen> Understand why supply train is good then implement it :)
2010-10-30T16:47:30  <Naktibalda_> that's rather high compared to number of bots (about 4000)

2010-10-30T16:48:14  <Todd200> i made two tweaks to the starter package,
2010-10-30T16:48:21  <Todd200> accually 4
2010-10-30T16:48:27  <rangzen> 2300 you have a start of strategy but probably no defense, no growthrate warning before attack, etc.
2010-10-30T16:48:35  <Todd200> yep
2010-10-30T16:49:02  <rangzen> I know cause i'm rank 2000 :)
2010-10-30T16:49:20  <Todd200> it has a max of 35 fleets, it gets most cost effive panet and sends 1/4 of its strongest planets ships to it
2010-10-30T16:49:49  <Todd200> and it likes using ships from it smaller planets insted of its large ones
2010-10-30T16:50:10  <rangzen> oh you can stop sending "part" of planets, you need to calculate exactly how much ships you send

2010-10-30T16:51:51  <rangzen> Your bot run so the fun part is now, you'll implement quick and grow up in rank quickly, it's fun before the top 500
2010-10-30T16:52:32  <Todd200> ?
2010-10-30T16:52:40  <Todd200> check my bot out :

2010-10-30T16:52:52  <rangzen> I was in top50 before I decided to rewrite all in another language and to stay in the ranks, you need improvment everyday. Very stressing :)
2010-10-30T16:53:02  <Todd200> fun thought
2010-10-30T16:53:10  <Todd200> though
2010-10-30T16:53:39  <rangzen> Python -> Java without any experience in Java :) Pain in the ass!!!
2010-10-30T16:53:55  <Todd200> im using python,
2010-10-30T16:54:05  <rangzen> Keep it!
2010-10-30T16:54:09  <Todd200> lol
2010-10-30T16:54:14  <virdo> Why did you decide to rewrite it?
2010-10-30T16:54:34  <virdo> Performance reasons?
2010-10-30T16:54:41  <rangzen> Learn a new langage, that's all.
2010-10-30T16:54:46  <virdo> Neat :)

2010-10-30T16:55:49  <rangzen> I was stuck to improve my bot (implementing queue and supply train) without complete rewriting so I thought why not in another langage :)
2010-10-30T16:56:01  <Todd200> the problem is with attacking a planet with exactly the amount of ships i need is that a good defense can snipe my target
2010-10-30T16:56:34  <virdo> Todd200: you're talking about taking neutral planets over?
2010-10-30T16:57:35  <Todd200> yep, it could send 6 ships to claim what ever i took
2010-10-30T16:58:42  <Todd200> im going to make my bot a bit more aggressive and resend it
2010-10-30T17:00:24  <rangzen> Test on the tcp server, if you can defend yourself there, you'll rock on the official server :)
2010-10-30T17:01:29  <Todd200> im yet to make the tcp work
2010-10-30T17:02:19  <virdo> at first you can test against example bots
2010-10-30T17:02:22  <Todd200> my bot always crashes
2010-10-30T17:02:38  <Todd200> im yet to make that work too
2010-10-30T17:02:55  <Todd200> the only place my bot ever works is where i upload it
2010-10-30T17:03:58  * Todd200 tries for the 20th time
2010-10-30T17:04:01  <virdo> How do you test your bot locally on your computer?
2010-10-30T17:04:12  <Todd200> i dont
2010-10-30T17:04:23  <Todd200> i wish i could

2010-10-30T17:23:41  <Naktibalda_> create a bat file
2010-10-30T17:23:43  <Todd200> no luck
2010-10-30T17:23:57  <virdo> you're doing the "java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar ..." command?
2010-10-30T17:24:01  <Naktibalda_> bot call must be a single filename for TCP, not two
2010-10-30T17:24:07  <Frontier> at first the unix file system layout confused me, but now I kinda like that everything user-executable resides in /usr/bin
2010-10-30T17:24:30  <Todd200> im on windows xp
2010-10-30T17:24:50  <Todd200> although my hacked ipod has a unix filesystem
2010-10-30T17:25:26  <virdo> before playing on the tcp server, I think you might as well get your bot working on your home environment using the playgame.jar ;)
2010-10-30T17:25:56  <Todd200> but it works on their server, which is all i really care about :p
2010-10-30T17:26:54  <virdo> you enjoy waiting long periods of time before seeing your bot in action? or submitting it non stop?
2010-10-30T17:30:13  <Todd200> i dont really mind...

2010-10-30T18:55:58  <demerzel_> eXtreme programming - we do whatever
2010-10-30T18:57:28  <rangzen> demerzel_: from Python to Java
2010-10-30T18:57:40  <demerzel_> why java
2010-10-30T18:58:19  <rangzen> Read a lot about it but never tried so 
2010-10-30T18:59:08  <demerzel_> ah just curious - i went to c++ cuz of the c# issues but now that i have i am glad i did because i can do an insane amount of calcs in c++
2010-10-30T18:59:25  <demerzel_> although it's day 3 or 4 and i still don't have a working bot
2010-10-30T18:59:28  <rangzen> The library is fine, Eclipse really impressive but it's so verbose compare to Python :(
2010-10-30T18:59:30  <demerzel_> at least its state is there
2010-10-30T18:59:53  <demerzel_> ah python is the one i don't know
2010-10-30T19:00:00  <demerzel_> it just looks crazy weird to me
2010-10-30T19:00:55  <rangzen> started from october but I have not enough time per day :)

2010-10-30T19:01:59  <rangzen> Very hard to discover a langage from start after almost 10 years of Python. But with already a good bot, it's easy to translate tools, logging, etc.
2010-10-30T19:02:18  <demerzel_> yea i started on this contest when i was unemployed got a job a few weeks back and my dev time has dropped a lot
2010-10-30T19:02:29  <demerzel_> but then i got to do it at work cuz we're waiting on docs haha
2010-10-30T19:03:04  <demerzel_> java is a good lang to start on imo it's portable and the syntax is close enough to a lot of other langs
2010-10-30T19:03:51  <rangzen> I miss Python a lot for short code but now I'm glad to understand a little more why Java is used on big project, you can't code fast, you need to think a lot
2010-10-30T19:04:32  <demerzel_> lol what a slogan
2010-10-30T19:04:36  <demerzel_> python: you don't need to think much
2010-10-30T19:05:25  <rangzen> The thing I miss the most in Python is :nb_my_ships = sum([f.NumShips() for f in pw.Fleets() if f.Owner() == 1 and f.DestinationPlanet() == p.PlanetID()])
2010-10-30T19:05:35  <rangzen> so long in Java 
2010-10-30T19:05:43  <rangzen> to have the same
2010-10-30T19:06:18  <rangzen> you can think fast, it's a bit different :)
2010-10-30T19:06:40  <demerzel_> foreach(f in pw.Fleets(nb_myships += f.Owner()==1 ?  f.Numships()  : 0)

2010-10-30T19:07:51  <demerzel_> what does that even do
2010-10-30T19:08:00  <demerzel_> the f.dest = planetid makes me think that's some weird index retrieval
2010-10-30T19:08:08  <rangzen> you don't have the filter on fleet's target and you have to declare all that :)
2010-10-30T19:08:29  <demerzel_> it sums the ships from 1 planet if it's yours?
2010-10-30T19:08:33  <demerzel_> that's a weird approach
2010-10-30T19:09:01  <rangzen> no you sum all ships from all your fleet going to a particular planet
2010-10-30T19:09:29  <demerzel_> oh oh fleets
2010-10-30T19:09:48  <demerzel_> about the only thing that's different then is the sum() vs a int nb_my_ships = 0;
2010-10-30T19:09:53  <rangzen> it's a bit strange the first time but when you use list everywhere it's so comfortable :)
2010-10-30T19:10:20  <demerzel_> nb is a good abbr for inbound i'm gonna steal it
2010-10-30T19:11:24  <demerzel_> i can't believe there are so few people that don't have a fleet struct
2010-10-30T19:11:32  <demerzel_> i don't
2010-10-30T19:12:41  <demerzel_> also why nobody uses arrays when the dims are known is weird to me too

2010-10-30T21:30:27  <demerzel_> yes the scenario where you do nothing

2010-10-30T21:31:22  <demerzel_> and so keeps recommending that as the best move forever lol
2010-10-30T21:31:27  <Frontier> bhasker: Your opponent lacked a second layer defense. He had enough ships to defend that planet, but didn't move them as if they were needed for some other defense.

2010-10-30T21:33:55  <demerzel_> i gotta get my bot to make more than one move haha
2010-10-30T21:33:58  <bhasker> and beat some very good bot
2010-10-30T21:34:05  <Frontier> bhasker: I see now, he actually *thought* he didn't lose that planet, but the distance calculation went wrong.
2010-10-30T21:34:05  <demerzel_> at least the one move it makes isn't bad lol
2010-10-30T21:34:21  <bhasker> which planet are you talking about
2010-10-30T21:34:49  <Frontier> The ships he sent to defend the lower planet you attacked took a route that was too long.
2010-10-30T21:34:55  <bhasker> ah yea
2010-10-30T21:35:07  <demerzel_> tbh you won because his 'safe expansion' backfired when you took that upper planet
2010-10-30T21:35:23  <demerzel_> most of his losses are due to his expansion being checked early
2010-10-30T21:36:21  <demerzel_> he has a nice linear expansion but it means that if you jump a couple planets ahead without leaving yourself open you can check him
2010-10-30T21:37:13  <demerzel_> obv easier said than done ;)
2010-10-30T21:37:20  <demerzel_> i still have a lot of issues figuring out optimal early expansion
2010-10-30T21:37:30  <bhasker> same here
2010-10-30T21:37:35  <bhasker> i am trying out a few different heuristics
2010-10-30T21:37:36  <demerzel_> very fine line between too conservative and too aggressive
2010-10-30T21:37:39  <bhasker> for optimal selection
2010-10-30T21:37:52  <bhasker> but all of them have some maps on which i end up picking wrong start planet
2010-10-30T21:37:56  <bhasker> and its downhill from there
2010-10-30T21:38:03  <demerzel_> yep it's hard to say
2010-10-30T21:38:11  <demerzel_> i thought oldman's method of go for broke was a good one
2010-10-30T21:38:21  <demerzel_> then i realized if i did better locally i could easily check him when he got to me
2010-10-30T21:38:35  <demerzel_> now i have no idea lol
2010-10-30T21:38:47  <demerzel_> i was going to emulate mega1's expansion but even that has vulnerabilities
2010-10-30T21:39:34  <Frontier> Is mega1's expansion worth a look at?
2010-10-30T21:39:50  <demerzel_> oh yea he has a nice flowing expansion
2010-10-30T21:39:53  <demerzel_> it's very nice
2010-10-30T21:40:08  <demerzel_> he is looking 2 - 4 ply ahead for sure
2010-10-30T21:41:04  <demerzel_> not to say that all of us aren't looking ahead but he's actually planning ahead 2-4 ply
2010-10-30T21:41:07  <Frontier> I'm going to waste some time trying to look 200 ply ahead and realizing that it would take forever. Wish me luck.
2010-10-30T21:41:19  <demerzel_> well it depends on what you're doing
2010-10-30T21:41:24  <demerzel_> i calc all 200 turns every turn it takes almost zero time
2010-10-30T21:41:29  <demerzel_> but trying to chain moves is another story
2010-10-30T21:43:15  <Frontier> It does include lots of chained moves and branches ^^. I know it is silly, but somehow I have to try it.
2010-10-30T21:45:07  <demerzel_> if i ever get 1-ply down i'll be taking it as far as i can
2010-10-30T21:45:11  <demerzel_> i'm still under 50ms
2010-10-30T21:46:06  <demerzel_> and there's a few while loops left i can get rid of lol
2010-10-30T21:48:30  <TravisD> Anyone know if Groovy is installed yet?
2010-10-30T21:48:48  <Frontier> At some point I decided to write my own server code and plug my bot in as a dll. It was too annoying to debug the bot through PlayGame.jar and cerr output. My old bot is also under 50ms I guess.
2010-10-30T21:52:11  <demerzel_> yea i wrote my own server code a while back but i really need the visualizer to see where i screwed up lol
2010-10-30T21:52:33  <demerzel_> i should just grab the js and do it locally but i'm already 5 projects deep lol
2010-10-30T21:53:35  <bhasker> so you guys are writing in c++?
2010-10-30T21:55:00  <Zannick> oh no, my bot is losing to copybot sometimes
2010-10-30T21:55:36  <demerzel_> i am writing in c++ now yea
2010-10-30T21:55:42  <demerzel_> was C#

2010-10-30T21:58:12  <demerzel_> i cannot figure out why my bot won't do jack past the first turn it has targets >:(
2010-10-30T21:59:23  <bhasker> lol
2010-10-30T21:59:31  <demerzel_> only thing it will do is launch after my planets are taken to the taken planets
2010-10-30T21:59:33  <demerzel_> bizarre
2010-10-30T22:00:48  * TravisD wonders if he should write his own server to help debug
2010-10-30T22:01:44  <demerzel_> nah i code the tcp shit directly into my bot now lol
2010-10-30T22:02:02  <demerzel_> i do wish the tcp vis had planet numbers tho sucks pasting it into that one every battle
2010-10-30T22:02:08  <Frontier> demerzel_: I whish it would be no work to write a visualizer on top of my server that takes 'drawables' from my bot so I can visually log stuff like a bar showing how many % of a planets ships are currently locked down for defense or assigned to a future mission.

2010-10-30T22:05:47  <Frontier> And how do you get the log for a certain round you look at in ShowGame.jar? ...
2010-10-30T22:07:24  <demerzel_> i don't use ShowGame.jar
2010-10-30T22:07:37  <demerzel_> but i do log turn# with every msg

2010-10-30T22:09:03  <demerzel_> argh now i completely broke it
2010-10-30T22:09:34  <Frontier> can I run a js visualizer stand-alone, like the ShowGame.jar?
2010-10-30T22:11:17  <Frontier> or... do you concatenate a html file with the visualizer and your server output to a new html file that you display in your browser ? Oo

2010-10-30T22:14:52  <antimatroid1> i finally downloaded that yesterday
2010-10-30T22:15:29  <Frontier> Because we want to debug our bot from inside our favorite IDE.

2010-10-30T22:16:48  <Frontier> That doesn't work by pressing 'debug' if the bot is running in a second process.
2010-10-30T22:17:12  <TravisD> Seems like more effort than it's worth
2010-10-30T22:17:14  <demerzel_> i actually built a proxy bot that just read from a file and passed to stdio
2010-10-30T22:17:46  <demerzel_> i use tcp as debug now even tho i feel a little guilty about it
2010-10-30T22:18:17  <demerzel_> i spent hours and hours tryng to debug errors that didn't exist using iouri's visualizer
2010-10-30T22:18:27  <demerzel_> sorta soured me on the whole local game thing
2010-10-30T22:18:32  <Frontier> as long as you don't need to stop for more than one second or have reconstructable game states.
2010-10-30T22:18:43  <bhasker> hah http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=786064
2010-10-30T22:19:49  <Frontier> TravisD: I was also able to help a newbie with his bot, by debugging it in my server. He sent two 'go' lines after each turn.
2010-10-30T22:21:20  <TravisD> that was nice of you
2010-10-30T22:21:33  <Frontier> TravisD: Also you can run tests (matches on all 100 maps for example) within one process. Things that took minutes to complete, run in seconds now

2010-10-30T22:23:06  <Frontier> JBotManager doesn't offer any batch mode, iirc.
2010-10-30T22:23:48  <Frontier> ...so it is a bit more than just the 'debug' button ;)
2010-10-30T22:24:39  <TravisD> Frontier: its overkill to write your own server to have the batch mode. Its easy enough to accomplish that with the provided PlayGame.jar file and a small script
2010-10-30T22:24:44  <TravisD> But I don't want to argue, lol

2010-10-30T22:31:29  <antimatroid1> defense is the first thing i do
2010-10-30T22:31:51  <antimatroid1> then i use trees for deciding expansionary and offensive moves, then pick redistribution at the end
2010-10-30T22:32:01  <antimatroid1> my bot sucks though
2010-10-30T22:32:19  <demerzel_> oh it crapped out invalid move
2010-10-30T22:32:26  <demerzel_> yea i've always made defense automatic
2010-10-30T22:33:03  <demerzel_> voidptr said something that made me consider making it optional tho - busy defending a 1 growth planet instead of capping the enemy who left theirs
2010-10-30T22:33:14  <demerzel_> it's really damn hard to figure out how to make it optional though

2010-10-30T23:17:42  <eburnette_> I tried one that gives a bonus for getting planets closer to the enemy but that causes it to become overextended
2010-10-30T23:18:23  <eburnette_> antimatroid1 I was wondering are you using antimatroids in your bot or was that just a random name?
2010-10-30T23:21:52  <eburnette_> The new donna and boris bots are doing pretty good; guess it's not too late for new people to enter
2010-10-30T23:23:32  <dmj111> i agree that it is not too late.  On tcp though, its always hard to tell who is who.
