2011-07-03T00:03:23  <janzert> contestbot: later tell Mcleopold http://pastebin.com/RHi6fLZG in this case we could probably catch the socket error, but it might be better in general to just retry getting a new task from the server whenever a task fails.
2011-07-03T00:03:23  <contestbot> janzert: Yep.

2011-07-03T01:37:25  <bhasker> what am i looking at?
2011-07-03T01:37:35  <antimatroid1> different methods of ordering my search queue
2011-07-03T01:37:36  <bhasker> path finding?
2011-07-03T01:37:52  <antimatroid1> p == on path, s == searched, v == visited, a == ant, * == food, % == wall
2011-07-03T01:38:07  <bhasker> ah k
2011-07-03T01:38:29  <antimatroid1> min h doesn't always give an optimal solution
2011-07-03T01:38:31  <antimatroid1> but it's pretty good

2011-07-03T05:28:59  <antimatroid1> i haven't really tested any larger maps yet
2011-07-03T05:29:35  <mcstar> im optimizing my heap-insert function now
2011-07-03T05:29:57  <mcstar> 0.6 seconds?
2011-07-03T05:30:23  <mcstar> antimatroid1: what does time taken mean?
2011-07-03T05:30:48  <antimatroid1> mcstar: time in milliseconds it took to run a star and backtrack the path information
2011-07-03T05:30:56  <antimatroid1> i haven't super refined it though, and it's too small to really get anything out of
2011-07-03T05:31:04  <mcstar> pfff, im feel better now
2011-07-03T05:31:09  <mcstar> -m
2011-07-03T05:31:39  <antimatroid1> v == visited/added to search queue, s == searched/taken off search queue, p == on path
2011-07-03T05:32:01  <mcstar> well, mine can do a 1000, 65 length path in 2 seconds
2011-07-03T05:32:02  <antimatroid1> no, 0.6 milliseconds :)
2011-07-03T05:32:57  <antimatroid1> i'm very impressed with just sorting by min h
2011-07-03T05:33:33  <mcstar> you know what i did? i changed the heap sorting operator from < to <= every time i used one of them
2011-07-03T05:34:06  <mcstar> because it seemed to me that one prefers horizontal the other vertical search
2011-07-03T05:35:43  <mcstar> its a bit hard to follow that ascii map :)
2011-07-03T05:36:30  <mcstar> antimatroid1: how come the second map, min f searched all the nodes?
2011-07-03T05:37:23  <mcstar> yeah, the min h didnt find the optimal path
2011-07-03T05:37:56  <mcstar> i experimented with weighted a*, and it behaves  much better time-wise in bad situations
2011-07-03T05:38:17  <mcstar> (of course it gives longer solutions but who cares)
2011-07-03T05:38:49  <mcstar> antimatroid1: ill load your map up
2011-07-03T05:38:58  <mcstar> i made mine work with ants maps
2011-07-03T05:39:10  <mcstar> but first ill finish my optimizations
2011-07-03T05:55:13  <antimatroid1> mcstar: it did find an optimal path i think
2011-07-03T05:55:15  <antimatroid1> there were two
2011-07-03T06:07:14  <mcstar> i counted the p's, the first sum is less than the second
2011-07-03T06:07:24  <mcstar> ergo the second cant be optima
2011-07-03T06:07:25  <mcstar> l
2011-07-03T06:08:45  <mcstar> but im confused, im not sure which one i counted second lol
2011-07-03T06:09:59  <antimatroid1> i coutned them before and got the same
2011-07-03T06:10:02  <antimatroid1> i'll do it again
2011-07-03T06:10:12  <antimatroid1> it gives both paths above where they should all be optimal
2011-07-03T06:10:42  <antimatroid1> yeah, i get 15 p's both ways to before it enters the object
2011-07-03T06:13:03  <antimatroid1> mcstar: i suspect the rest search the entire outside because each of those locations are estimated to be shorted than the final path?
2011-07-03T06:13:24  <antimatroid1> i'm going to tweak my map generator later to make search situations
2011-07-03T06:13:31  <antimatroid1> but i think i'ma got to a friends place for a while first
2011-07-03T06:13:46  <mcstar> have fun

2011-07-03T10:59:23  <kashlavor> so I did notice that the strategy section is almost completely empty, guessing no one is posting their secret plans or somesuch?
2011-07-03T10:59:57  <olexs> since the challenge hasn't even started yet, little activity is to be expected
2011-07-03T11:01:47  <kashlavor> when does it actualy start?
2011-07-03T11:01:51  <kashlavor> any word on that
2011-07-03T11:02:52  <olexs> nope, none yet. development is moving on steadily, but a deadline hasn't been set yet, as far as I know. it'll eventually start when most issues have been fixed and most active community members are happy with everything
2011-07-03T11:02:58  <mcstar> it will start anytime or a little later
2011-07-03T11:03:36  <mcstar> (sry, i was told almost the same thing, and its nice to give it back to the community)
2011-07-03T11:03:53  <kashlavor> lol, good enough I suppose
2011-07-03T11:04:15  <kashlavor> still figuring out map generation, making a server, all that good stuff?

2011-07-03T11:23:21  <olexs> my bot had a few close losses against high-ranked bots and gained skill from those games
2011-07-03T11:23:43  <jmcarthur> it ranks the players of the match. if you came in first, that's all it knows. it's not aware of how many more points you got over second place

2011-07-03T11:24:58  <jmcarthur> you can gain some apparent skill from losing though because it still shrinks the range of its estimate of your skill
2011-07-03T11:25:15  <jmcarthur> just slightly
2011-07-03T11:26:06  <olexs> is trueskill actually stable now? I remember it being an issue

2011-07-03T11:28:23  <olexs> it seems to be more or less constant the past days, however, the skill gaps between top bots are quite large
2011-07-03T11:28:30  <kashlavor> theres never any possibility of being in a match against yourself right?
2011-07-03T11:29:15  <jmcarthur> there shouldn't be
2011-07-03T11:29:19  <olexs> I've never seen that happen
2011-07-03T11:29:27  <kashlavor> I suppose that wouldnt really mean anything
2011-07-03T11:30:08  <olexs> well, if your bot is deterministic, on symmetric maps playing against itself should always end in a draw
2011-07-03T11:30:25  <kashlavor> I meant more as far as the rankings go
2011-07-03T11:30:32  <kashlavor> but yes, that would be interesting to see

2011-07-03T11:33:02  <kashlavor> has anything emerged so far as to "what makes a good bot?"?
2011-07-03T11:33:58  <olexs> collect all food you see as fast as you can, don't lose ants unneccesarily, control as much terrain as possible, don't time out? :)
2011-07-03T11:35:57  <kashlavor> sums it all up pretty well
2011-07-03T11:36:18  <kashlavor> but avoiding losses seems to lead to alot of bouncing back and forth, steady oscillations that is
2011-07-03T11:36:52  <olexs> a loss = a point to the enemy. you have to figure out what's better for you, lose a square of terrain or lose a point
2011-07-03T11:36:53  <kashlavor> like a 2 v 1 ant standstill, just because the two ants alternately retreat and advance, just never at the same time
2011-07-03T11:37:30  <olexs> maybe retreat and let some reinforcements come in, then attack once you have the overwhelming force
2011-07-03T11:37:46  <kashlavor> sounds like a plan, just trying to figure out how
2011-07-03T11:37:59  <kashlavor> was just looking at the replays from the top few people, didnt seem to have that y et
2011-07-03T11:38:32  <olexs> my bot can do that, when it deems it appropriate

2011-07-03T11:40:23  <kashlavor> do orders get passed down from the top or is it more of a spontaneous self organizing thing?
2011-07-03T11:41:27  <olexs> kashvalor: self-organizing in my case. groups of ants facing enemies are recognized, and a best choice of action is made for the whole group, with multiple possibilities simulated and evaluated
2011-07-03T11:41:53  <jmcarthur> so i've moved and everything and this contest *still* hasn't started?

2011-07-03T11:42:38  <UncleVasya> olexs: Hi. About a hour ago I've finally got something that looks like fighting. I'm glad now because it was simple only in my thoughts and to code it was hard enough.

2011-07-03T11:43:27  <UncleVasya> olexs: Now I have tomorrow's evening + whole day after tomorrow for testing tool.
2011-07-03T11:44:08  <olexs> UncleVasya: cool, looking forward to the new version, it's quite helpful for fine-tuning

2011-07-03T11:47:03  <olexs> UncleVasya: that's a good idea. What would be really great is if it could save the error output for each bot (using the -E and --error_logs options in playgame.py), so I could check my debug output when I see something weird in a replay
2011-07-03T11:50:08  <UncleVasya> I'll look how it works. I use mybot.txt for storing all debug information of bot behaviour. Now I even don't know what the -E option does.
2011-07-03T11:50:39  <jbrechtel> It looks like the Scala starter package crashes when uploaded to the test server.  However when I run it against the test_bot script I get no crash...it is just eliminated in about 22 turns.
2011-07-03T11:51:12  <jbrechtel> The command line I'm giving test_bot.sh to run the bot includes the classpath.  I can't seem to find what exact command line the server is using to run the bot.
2011-07-03T11:51:48  <jbrechtel> Well, rather, I can find that and it doesn't seem to include the classpath...so I presume it's just executed in the directory of the bot itself?
2011-07-03T11:52:11  <olexs> UncleVasya: also, the tool crashes with the current git repo, with an error like this: ''turn": 126'' is not a valid integer value., after the first game. no results are being displayed in the table, and restarting a game, the tool just freezes
2011-07-03T11:52:59  <jbrechtel> Anyone have any idea where I should start with debugging this?
2011-07-03T11:53:08  <UncleVasya> yeah, it happens when replay-format is changing.
2011-07-03T11:53:55  <UncleVasya> it was to olecs.

2011-07-03T11:55:40  <UncleVasya> olexs: I want to keep my app compatible with tools.zip because it some kind of official package.
2011-07-03T11:55:51  <olexs> okay
2011-07-03T11:58:35  <UncleVasya> We can ask McLeopold or someone else to update tools.zip to the newer git repo. But I don't know how stable the current format is (I mean how long it will stay without another changes).
2011-07-03T11:59:38  <olexs> hm
2011-07-03T11:59:51  <olexs> I've just downloaded the tools.zip from the beta and used it, same error
2011-07-03T12:00:07  <jmcarthur> the starter packages page on the beta site lists the ghc version as 6.8.2. did we revert back to that for some reason?
2011-07-03T12:01:15  <UncleVasya> I'm afraid that even if I update tool to work with current git repo it soon became uncompatible with another git repo and I'll not be able to fix it while I'm out of computer. I don't know what to do with it.
2011-07-03T12:02:21  <UncleVasya> olexs: ok, so tools.zip already updated. I missed it. I'll make a compability with it. Thanks for feedbacks.
2011-07-03T12:03:31  <jmcarthur> hmm, i guess that page is probably just wrong
2011-07-03T12:04:56  <jbrechtel> jmcarthur: It was wrong for Scala.  The readme in its starter package says 2.8.1 while the site says 2.7.7

2011-07-03T12:14:46  <|UncleVasya|> 2. ocamlbuild doesn't work for me because it tries to launch BASH commands.
2011-07-03T12:15:28  <smiley1983> Oh. I guess the answer to that is Cygwin, but if I remember correctly that's a large install process involving lots of downloads, which is not really viable on dialup
2011-07-03T12:16:01  <smiley1983> However, ocamlbuild just calls ocamlopt in the end
2011-07-03T12:16:25  <smiley1983> so if you're happy writing makefiles or compile scripts, I'd use that
2011-07-03T12:17:03  <smiley1983> ocamlopt directly, that is - its syntax is the same as for ocamlc for basic operations

2011-07-03T13:47:11  <antimatroid1> there would be a lot of messing around in getting much out of game trees for battles
2011-07-03T13:51:56  <jmcarthur> well, during the time that this game has been under development, i've interviewed for a job, gotten a job offer, waited a month before accepted, waited nearly two more months before moving, moved, started working, and am almost settled in now, at it's still not ready. i had originally dropped all this because i thought it would be about over by the time i got a chance to sit down with it
2011-07-03T13:52:31  <jmcarthur> i also am not really digging this game as much as the last two games we did :\
2011-07-03T13:53:39  <antimatroid1> yeah, it would have been nice to be ready earlier
2011-07-03T13:53:48  <antimatroid1> i don't think the game is as interesting
2011-07-03T13:53:56  <antimatroid1> but i think it's better suited to ai than planet wars
2011-07-03T13:54:00  <antimatroid1> and offers more to do than tron
2011-07-03T13:54:07  <jmcarthur> i'm almost considering just trying something highly experimental, because i don't think i'll get much enjoyment from it otherwise
2011-07-03T13:54:10  <antimatroid1> so i still have decent hopes of it being another great contest
2011-07-03T13:54:13  <jmcarthur> maybe something like a neural network or something

2011-07-03T13:55:09  <jmcarthur> path finding is essentially "solved" once you have A* with a heuristic that doesn't overestimate

2011-07-03T13:56:30  <antimatroid1> you can also "reuse" ants (and future ants) for collecting food
2011-07-03T13:56:44  <antimatroid1> or you can use information about where enemy ants can reach in what number of turns to avoid them while pathfinding etc.
2011-07-03T13:58:19  <jmcarthur> i'm curious how well a NN could do just based on training from other bots' games

2011-07-03T13:58:51  <mcstar> what i really want now: is not to dispose of my board which has pretty much information on it(the board where i keep my "closed" set)
2011-07-03T13:58:54  <jmcarthur> ouch, maze maps might break NN ;)

2011-07-03T14:00:15  <antimatroid1> there's a couple of examples, i've made a symmetric block maze, removed some extra water blocks, then arbitrarily removed single cell water around the edge
2011-07-03T14:00:55  <antimatroid1> i think mcleopold wants to save those maps for the official launch
2011-07-03T14:01:20  <jmcarthur> ah these aren't too "mazy". NN might do decently on those
2011-07-03T14:01:59  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: how's the new job anyway? :P
2011-07-03T14:02:01  <antimatroid1> what are you doing?
2011-07-03T14:03:21  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: you know we're using option1/power/occupied/your one for battles again too yeah? :)
2011-07-03T14:03:30  <jmcarthur> i'm working here: http://www.janestcapital.com/
2011-07-03T14:03:43  <jmcarthur> yeah i saw that on the beta site
2011-07-03T14:04:11  <antimatroid1> the damage option allowed blocking way to easily
2011-07-03T14:04:12  <jmcarthur> noticed a lot more hesitance for bots to attack now, too

2011-07-03T14:05:10  <antimatroid1> what language are you using?
2011-07-03T14:05:24  <antimatroid1> i imagine you're in heaven if haskell? :P
2011-07-03T14:06:08  <jmcarthur> we don't wear suits there :P
2011-07-03T14:06:15  <jmcarthur> it's ocaml
2011-07-03T14:06:32  <antimatroid1> that's where the comment came from :P
2011-07-03T14:06:34  <jmcarthur> but i work with a bunch of haskell heads at least, and ocaml beats C in my book
2011-07-03T14:06:39  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-03T14:06:49  <jmcarthur> i don't remember what the web site says about dress code
2011-07-03T14:07:01  <jmcarthur> i've been wearing tshirts and jean shorts for the most part so far
2011-07-03T14:07:12  <jmcarthur> actually, i have yet to work at a place where i have to dress up
2011-07-03T14:07:45  <antimatroid1> nice, i turn up to work in board shorts and thongs in the middle of summer
2011-07-03T14:07:48  <antimatroid1> tis nice
2011-07-03T14:07:59  <antimatroid1> thongs == sandals in australia
2011-07-03T14:08:06  <jmcarthur> thanks for clarifying
2011-07-03T14:08:07  <antimatroid1> not the other ones :P

2011-07-03T14:32:59  <jmcarthur> i stand by my assertion that my old library was waaay overengineered
2011-07-03T14:33:16  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur: are you going for grids this time? or sets again?
2011-07-03T14:33:28  <jmcarthur> hmm?
2011-07-03T14:33:28  <antimatroid1> i've got a grid with neighbour information set up during turn 0
2011-07-03T14:33:32  <antimatroid1> so it's like a graph
2011-07-03T14:33:51  <antimatroid1> then when i get water information i remove the relevant neighbour information
2011-07-03T14:34:27  <antimatroid1> should be speedier for path finding
2011-07-03T14:34:34  <jmcarthur> oh i see
2011-07-03T14:34:40  <jmcarthur> i haven't thought that far yet
2011-07-03T14:35:11  <jmcarthur> so what is your representation then?
2011-07-03T14:35:26  <jmcarthur> just an array or some sort of graph structure with pointers?
2011-07-03T14:35:49  <antimatroid1> i have a grid struct that just has a 2d vector of squares, each square has a vector of locations for neighbours
2011-07-03T14:35:58  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-03T14:36:22  <jmcarthur> are you certain that is faster than just having a 2d array of the map?

2011-07-03T14:37:47  <antimatroid1> what do you mean? instead of what?
2011-07-03T14:38:24  <antimatroid1> i can use turn 0 (start up turn where bots are passed parameters) to create all the neighbour information, then i just have to remove info whenever i get water information
2011-07-03T14:38:28  <mcstar> instead of storing nbor information?
2011-07-03T14:38:41  <jmcarthur> i mean what benefit does this give you vs. just using the map directly?
2011-07-03T14:38:56  <jmcarthur> in the usual row-column format
2011-07-03T14:39:32  <antimatroid1> don't search onto water? and don't have to call a get location function that has to wrap your translation etc.
2011-07-03T14:39:47  <jmcarthur> seeing whether a cell is water is a very fast operation
2011-07-03T14:39:50  <antimatroid1> sure you skip water, but now you don't even touch it, it's just not something you can come across
2011-07-03T14:40:20  <antimatroid1> mostly i care about not calling get loc all the time though
2011-07-03T14:41:19  <mcstar> but you call struct.nbor.N or something like that
2011-07-03T14:41:35  <jmcarthur> A* can be written completely independently of the underlying representation
2011-07-03T14:41:48  <antimatroid1> surely indexing a vector is better than calculating a neighbouring location
2011-07-03T14:41:57  <jmcarthur> calculating?
2011-07-03T14:41:59  <antimatroid1> and you have to do 4 per node searched
2011-07-03T14:42:12  <antimatroid1> well if you have a location and you want it's neighbours, you need to calculate them?
2011-07-03T14:42:16  <mcstar> my 'wrap' function doesnt use mod, or rem, actually, its a recursive wrap, and its pretty fast
2011-07-03T14:42:25  <jmcarthur> 4 cache-friendly memory accesses can be much friendlier than 3 cache-unfriendly memory accesses though
2011-07-03T14:42:44  <antimatroid1> hmmmmmm
2011-07-03T14:43:16  <jmcarthur> but i don't know the details of your structure
2011-07-03T14:43:22  <jmcarthur> i could be cache friendly for all i know
2011-07-03T14:43:22  <antimatroid1> http://pastebin.com/YpzEGP4c that's my getLocation function
2011-07-03T14:43:24  <jmcarthur> *it
2011-07-03T14:44:29  <jmcarthur> mcstar: a recursive wrap? you mean just substract the height or width until the result is in the correct range?
2011-07-03T14:44:31  <antimatroid1> to access it from say state, i would call "grid[location].neighbours[neighbourNo]", grid[location] is an inline index function which returns the reference to the square there, then it just indexes a vector?
2011-07-03T14:44:42  <mcstar> jmcarthur: yes
2011-07-03T14:44:55  <jmcarthur> yeah that seems like it might actually be nicer than modulus operation, but i don't know
2011-07-03T14:45:07  <mcstar> its faster for me
2011-07-03T14:45:38  <jmcarthur> branches can be free if the prediction is right, so yeah that makes sense
2011-07-03T14:45:44  <mcstar> http://pastebin.com/zjwrRruE
2011-07-03T14:47:19  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: that sounds no less expensive than what mcstar is doing, to me
2011-07-03T14:47:38  <antimatroid1> is it more expensive?
2011-07-03T14:47:40  <jmcarthur> maybe even more expensive
2011-07-03T14:47:47  <antimatroid1> once set up it's actually nicer to program with imo
2011-07-03T14:47:53  <antimatroid1> ah yeah, hmmm oh well
2011-07-03T14:48:01  <jmcarthur> it may be, but you can always hide the implementation behind a nicer interface
2011-07-03T14:48:02  <antimatroid1> i'll consider testing times with the other method later
2011-07-03T14:48:11  <jmcarthur> like i said, A* can be written agnostic to the data structure
2011-07-03T14:48:29  <antimatroid1> yes, but a* is a sinch to implement
2011-07-03T14:48:53  <antimatroid1> at least for this, i don't even need the open/closed set stuff, i just have a priority queue for my search queue ordered however I define the operator
2011-07-03T14:48:57  <jmcarthur> my point is just that you can write the interface you want even if it doesn't match the implementation
2011-07-03T14:49:44  <antimatroid1> yeah
2011-07-03T14:49:53  <mcstar> antimatroid1: how come mine with a priority list(not heap) is faster than the cpp version of your's?
2011-07-03T14:50:01  <jmcarthur> note the complete lack of graph structure in this interface :)  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/astar/0.2.1/doc/html/Data-Graph-AStar.html
2011-07-03T14:50:11  <antimatroid1> mcstar: could be numerous reasons :P
2011-07-03T14:50:39  <jmcarthur> i do wish Set didn't appear in that type signature, actually
2011-07-03T14:50:55  <antimatroid1> mcstar: let's test, do your simple a* 500 times?
2011-07-03T14:51:19  <mcstar> i didt the previous search 5000 times in 1.5 seconds
2011-07-03T14:51:26  <antimatroid1> okay
2011-07-03T14:51:29  <mcstar> as far as i remember
2011-07-03T14:51:43  <mcstar> but i wrote that 0.3 ms was for 1 search

2011-07-03T14:56:27  <antimatroid1> mcstar: are you backtracking the path?
2011-07-03T14:56:45  <antimatroid1> yeah
2011-07-03T14:56:52  <antimatroid1> hmmm, note to self, make faster
2011-07-03T14:57:27  * jmcarthur writes a simpler parser using fewer libraries
2011-07-03T14:58:02  <jmcarthur> probably will be slower but who gives a shit
2011-07-03T14:59:42  <jmcarthur> oh i met mightybyte on wednesday
2011-07-03T15:00:28  <antimatroid1> oh, how did you know who each other were?
2011-07-03T15:00:44  <jmcarthur> we met intentionally. we and a few other haskellers in NYC at the time
2011-07-03T15:01:00  <antimatroid1> i think sigh was going to try and meet up with (i think) zannick while in mtv, not sure if it happened
2011-07-03T15:04:46  <jmcarthur> so you are only told about a particular food location the first time you see it?
2011-07-03T15:05:07  <jmcarthur> unless you were later told the food has been removed, and then you are told again the next time you see it and there is food there?
2011-07-03T15:05:29  <antimatroid1> where did you see that?
2011-07-03T15:05:33  <antimatroid1> we don't have that anymore
2011-07-03T15:05:44  <antimatroid1> you just get given food information every time a food square is in vision
2011-07-03T15:06:01  <mcstar> antimatroid1: yes, i walk back on the red squares, by accessing the parents' coordinates
2011-07-03T15:06:06  <antimatroid1> visible*
2011-07-03T15:06:36  <jmcarthur> antimatroid1: are you ever told explicitly that food has been removed or is it simply not reported when it's gone?

2011-07-03T15:07:29  <antimatroid1> try the github wiki page
2011-07-03T15:07:33  <jmcarthur> does github have a more up to date spec?
2011-07-03T15:07:35  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-07-03T15:07:36  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-07-03T15:07:41  <jmcarthur> i hope i don't have to change too much now
2011-07-03T15:07:49  <antimatroid1> nah it should be alright
2011-07-03T15:08:20  <jmcarthur> water squares are still sent only once, right?
2011-07-03T15:08:56  <antimatroid1> yep
2011-07-03T15:09:00  <antimatroid1> the best way i've found for tracking food information out of view is to copy food information before clearing it at the end of each turn, then going through and re-adding it after reading the state and updating vision information if the location isn't currently visible.
2011-07-03T15:09:17  <antimatroid1> best == easiest
2011-07-03T15:09:20  <antimatroid1> not fastest
2011-07-03T15:09:35  <jmcarthur> i'm using a purely functional language. no copy is necessary ;)
2011-07-03T15:09:46  <antimatroid1> :p
2011-07-03T15:10:40  <jmcarthur> i also dislike that because it reports food even if you don't know whether it's been destroyed or eaten
2011-07-03T15:10:59  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?
2011-07-03T15:11:04  <jmcarthur> i dislike that for the same reason that i dislike assuming a cell is land until you see it
2011-07-03T15:11:14  <antimatroid1> oh, yeah okay
2011-07-03T15:11:19  <antimatroid1> i am happy to make those two assumptions
2011-07-03T15:11:22  <antimatroid1> i think they work well
2011-07-03T15:11:37  <antimatroid1> from the looks on the beta site, it's worth tracking food outside view
2011-07-03T15:12:11  <jmcarthur> i'm probably going to tie "certainty" to things i can't see
2011-07-03T15:12:28  <antimatroid1> my bot on there is still fairly simple, it uses my multi target a* for collecting food, then enemies (if it thinks i have enough ants) then bombs vision information while finding not visible stuff
2011-07-03T15:12:33  <jmcarthur> with some heuristics based on what i think other players are doing and stuff
2011-07-03T15:12:57  <jmcarthur> (very very simple heuristics, but better than just assuming the food is still there)
2011-07-03T15:13:14  <antimatroid1> yeah, i want to track "where enemy ants might be"
2011-07-03T15:13:16  <jmcarthur> (and better than just assuming an area of land has no food just because i didn't see any last time i was there)
2011-07-03T15:13:34  <antimatroid1> i'm unsure about whether i want to use markov chains fully or just say yeah an enemy could be here
2011-07-03T15:13:39  <jmcarthur> hmm... is the spawn rate and/or algorithm specified?
2011-07-03T15:13:47  <jmcarthur> for food, i mean
2011-07-03T15:14:00  <antimatroid1> it's a bit messy and not fixed :P
2011-07-03T15:14:09  <jmcarthur> darn
2011-07-03T15:14:10  <antimatroid1> mcleopold knows it best, i can give a brief overview..
2011-07-03T15:14:15  <Zannick> antimatroid1: yes, that happened
2011-07-03T15:14:21  <jmcarthur> well, i don't even care unless it's speced
2011-07-03T15:14:49  <antimatroid1> it's not specced anywhere i don't think
2011-07-03T15:15:28  <jmcarthur> it would make it a lot easier for me to compute confidence levels of food locations is that algorithm and spawn rate was speced in some way
2011-07-03T15:15:38  <jmcarthur> *if that
2011-07-03T15:16:07  <antimatroid1> you find a basis for the "symmetrically equivalent squares" on the grid, randomly order the basis, then add that to say a queue with the number of symmetrically equivalent locations (the orbit?) of the chosen one in the queue location, then something like while spawned + queue.front().size() <= turn*spawnrate add food
2011-07-03T15:16:22  <antimatroid1> but really we're not positive on that being best

2011-07-03T15:16:31  <antimatroid1> what do you think about that as a food spawn idea?
2011-07-03T15:16:46  <jmcarthur> basically designed to ensure some amount of "fairness" i'm guessing?
2011-07-03T15:16:48  <antimatroid1> also, if an ant resides where a food item is meant to spawn, it just queues up and waits to spawn it there the next turn that location is free
2011-07-03T15:16:54  <antimatroid1> yeah, i want symmetry
2011-07-03T15:17:13  <antimatroid1> we've discovered with the introduction of non-tile symmetry that this isn't all that fair all the time though
2011-07-03T15:17:25  <antimatroid1> as sometimes the "symmetrically equivalent" locations are right next to each other
2011-07-03T15:18:09  *** |UncleVasya| <|UncleVasya|!kvirc@46.133.81.83> has joined #aichallenge
2011-07-03T15:18:48  <jmcarthur> i was thinking we could just store the number of times each cell has had food on it (or maybe the number of turns since the last time it had food on it) and weight the next spawn point based on that, otherwise being distributed randomly.
2011-07-03T15:19:02  <jmcarthur> asymmetry doesn't bother me as much as it bothers you
2011-07-03T15:19:12  <antimatroid1> that might be best
2011-07-03T15:19:24  <jmcarthur> to me as long as the asymmetry is uniform then it's okay
2011-07-03T15:19:26  <antimatroid1> i would like to have this symmetric option at least for testing locally
2011-07-03T15:19:36  <jmcarthur> s/asymmetry/randomness/
2011-07-03T15:19:37  <antimatroid1> but yeah, especially with the new problem with different symmetries
2011-07-03T15:20:19  <jmcarthur> i also think the food spawn rate should be a parameter given on turn 0, especially if we settle down on a spawn algorithm (which i would like to do)
2011-07-03T15:20:41  <antimatroid1> i think we're trying to hide information like that
2011-07-03T15:20:46  <antimatroid1> you don't get the number of players etc.
2011-07-03T15:20:55  <antimatroid1> but i'm unsure of what people would think of that idea
2011-07-03T15:21:05  <jmcarthur> the spawn rate is a map-uniform property though
2011-07-03T15:21:21  <antimatroid1> not necessarily
2011-07-03T15:21:27  <jmcarthur> i don't think it affects your early-game strategy that much
2011-07-03T15:21:37  <jmcarthur> certainly not as much as knowing the number of players would
2011-07-03T15:21:38  <antimatroid1> if the dimensions vary significantly, or the number of players, the spawn rate will need to adjust?
2011-07-03T15:21:50  <jmcarthur> the dimensions are known up front, aren't they?
2011-07-03T15:21:54  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-07-03T15:22:16  <jmcarthur> IMO, number of players and spawn rate needn't be very related, at least not independently of map dimensions
2011-07-03T15:22:41  <antimatroid1> oh, especially not if it's done like i said above
2011-07-03T15:22:46  <jmcarthur> that is, they will be correlated, but only because they would both correlate to the map dimensions
2011-07-03T15:23:23  <antimatroid1> i'll have a chat to mcleopold about it next time i see him
2011-07-03T15:24:12  <antimatroid1> i'm still unsure about asymmetric maps :\
2011-07-03T15:24:22  <antimatroid1> i could probably make reasonably fair ones though
2011-07-03T15:24:24  <jmcarthur> we are testing with both right now?
2011-07-03T15:24:36  <jmcarthur> *are we
2011-07-03T15:24:39  <antimatroid1> i'd generate like n basis ones like i was making symmetric maps, but then not rotate/tile it
2011-07-03T15:24:43  * jmcarthur hasn't been watching many games
2011-07-03T15:24:45  <antimatroid1> nope, they're all symmetric
2011-07-03T15:24:47  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-07-03T15:25:02  <jmcarthur> if we don't test with asymmetric maps then we should certainly not introduce them into the main contest
2011-07-03T15:25:05  <antimatroid1> i wasn't paying much attention, but they decided to just use symmetric at some point, which i wasn't going to argue about :p
2011-07-03T15:25:34  <jmcarthur> but i would like to at least test with them and see how bad it makes things, if at all
2011-07-03T15:26:43  <jmcarthur> one thing about symmetry that i don't know that i like that much is the fact that bots can try to guess the kind of symmetry and therefore guess where water is on the rest of the map
2011-07-03T15:26:53  <jmcarthur> maybe that's not so bad though
2011-07-03T15:27:32  <jmcarthur> but given that it could happen, i would want symmetry/asymmetry/mixed to be speced
2011-07-03T15:28:01  <jmcarthur> because if it's not speced then that's an opportunity that some people might not know to take advantage of
2011-07-03T15:28:39  <antimatroid1> yes, but... we have tile symmetry for any number of players, 5 types of 2 player rotational symmetry, 3 types for 4 players and >1 for 8 player
2011-07-03T15:28:58  <antimatroid1> and i can translate the rotationally symmetric maps, making the symmetry even harder to detect in some cases
2011-07-03T15:29:30  <antimatroid1> (rotations including transposes/diagonal rotations of the grid)
2011-07-03T15:30:23  <jmcarthur> i'm not convinced about the difficulty of detecting the symmetry type. in fact, this might actually make it easier to guess the number of players, too

2011-07-03T16:09:07  <jmcarthur> a finger tree basically gives you a sequence with O(log n) random access, O(1) access to the ends, O(log n) concatenation, and, when given some annotations at each node, the ability to keep up-to-date accumulations from left to right without affecting the algorithmic complexity such that you can use that data when searching the tree
2011-07-03T16:10:07  <jmcarthur> for example, when the accumulation is just the number of elements in the sequence (that is, from left to right the accumulations are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...), you can use those annotations for O(log n) indexing, and also O(1) size/length queries
2011-07-03T16:10:28  <jmcarthur> if it's min/max operations, you get stuff like priority queues
2011-07-03T16:11:00  <jmcarthur> there's all sorts of crazy stuff you can do with annotated finger trees
2011-07-03T16:11:25  <mcstar> sorry, a fly invaded my private airspace

2011-07-03T20:23:52  <mcstar> i hope that was for 5e3
2011-07-03T20:24:51  <mleise> hehe, wasn't he using c++ and you were using haskel? and his cpu was 1.4x faster?
2011-07-03T20:25:35  <mcstar> common lisp
2011-07-03T20:25:42  <mcstar> i dont know haskell yet
2011-07-03T20:26:51  <mcstar> the common wisdom among lispers is that cl can beat C in cases, when the program is very complex, and the cl code is optimized

2011-07-03T20:27:19  <mleise> hmm ok considering the speed factor of the cpu that would be 0.52 ms per path for antimatroid.
2011-07-03T20:27:28  <mcstar> in this case it wasnt very complex, but i payed attention to optimizing it, and in fact im still doing it
2011-07-03T20:28:25  <mcstar> and there's another thing: it seems that the heap based priority queue is an overkill
2011-07-03T20:28:27  <mleise> ok then I have a rough estimate on how long pathfinding on that test map should take :)
2011-07-03T20:29:04  <mleise> this one, right? http://pastebin.com/A6uuU4LA
2011-07-03T20:29:05  <mcstar> i have one implemented using lists proficiently, and i can imagine that the cpp's stl isnt very efficient for small sizes
2011-07-03T20:29:47  <mcstar> well, on that map the alg. scans all the nodes
2011-07-03T20:30:09  <mcstar> so it cannot get more complex than that(in that situation)
2011-07-03T20:30:24  <mleise> hmm that may be. or depending on the data structure there is some copying done under the hood
2011-07-03T20:30:39  <mcstar> but still, in the game paths will still be shorter
2011-07-03T20:31:40  <mcstar> so, if you dont want to time out before you win(and say you have quite a lot ants) this can be an issue
2011-07-03T20:32:01  <Gudradain> hey you guys are working on pathfinding?
2011-07-03T20:32:13  <Gudradain> is it on a grid map?
2011-07-03T20:32:26  <mcstar> i will tell antimatroid to try not using the stl's priority queue, see if it help
2011-07-03T20:32:28  <mcstar> s
2011-07-03T20:32:50  <mcstar> Gudradain: no, im using a photorealistic vector-map
2011-07-03T20:32:58  <mcstar> :)
2011-07-03T20:33:26  <Gudradain> hmmm the name lost me :)
2011-07-03T20:33:44  <Gudradain> do you mean you use geometric form to find a path?
2011-07-03T20:33:52  <mcstar> i mean i was joking
2011-07-03T20:33:57  <Gudradain> lol
2011-07-03T20:34:06  <mcstar> have you seen an Ants map?
2011-07-03T20:34:14  <mcstar> on the beta site maybe?

2011-07-03T20:35:17  <mcstar> mleise: like what?
2011-07-03T20:36:20  <mleise> like it copies structures often when you just want a pointer
2011-07-03T20:36:35  <Gudradain> nice, so the goal is to collect the most little circle to win right
2011-07-03T20:37:45  <mcstar> the goal is to win, and you can collect food, and engage in battle
2011-07-03T20:37:49  <mleise> Gudradain: more or less, yes. you are also supposed to fight the enemy ants in a way that you lose less ants

2011-07-03T20:46:37  <jmcarthur> yeah compilers for C-like languages tend to not be as advanced as far as crazier optimizations go
2011-07-03T20:46:41  <mcstar> i wrote this just before you left
2011-07-03T20:47:29  <jmcarthur> what they lack on macro optimizations they tend to make up for with micro optimizations, though
2011-07-03T20:47:53  <mcstar> you mean global, right?
2011-07-03T20:48:17  <jmcarthur> well, not only global, but that would fit into what i am calling "macro", yes
2011-07-03T20:48:33  <mcstar> when you say macro i think of a different thing...
2011-07-03T20:48:50  <jmcarthur> what do you think of?
2011-07-03T20:48:59  <mcstar> do you know lisp?
2011-07-03T20:49:09  <jmcarthur> not much
2011-07-03T20:49:11  <jmcarthur> oh
2011-07-03T20:49:14  <jmcarthur> you mean a lisp macro
2011-07-03T20:49:27  <mcstar> or any other language's macro
2011-07-03T20:49:33  <jmcarthur> i just mean "macro" as in "large scale"
2011-07-03T20:49:43  <jmcarthur> as opposed to "micro"
2011-07-03T20:49:55  <mcstar> i know :) but since i use lisp, macro for me is not that kind of macro
2011-07-03T20:50:01  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-07-03T20:50:58  <mcstar> so, there are times when cpp copies whole data structures instead of giving a reference to them?
2011-07-03T20:51:01  <mleise> mcstar: Beginners often accidently copy objects in function returns in C++
2011-07-03T20:51:30  <mcstar> can you return classes or functions:
2011-07-03T20:51:32  <mcstar> ?
2011-07-03T20:51:40  <jmcarthur> that is a common problem, yes, but it's still not the only thing i am talking about
2011-07-03T20:54:11  <jmcarthur> languages that can give the compiler more information about the meaning and invariants of the program stand to benefit from some pretty insane optimizations, like fusion or vectorization (by which i mean vectorizing very large, complex algorithms, not just for-loops like most C-like language compilers can manage)
2011-07-03T20:54:44  <mcstar> thats why they hail the haskell type system right?
2011-07-03T20:54:50  <jmcarthur> well
2011-07-03T20:54:52  <mcstar> for one example

2011-07-03T20:55:03  <mleise> mcstar: classes? there is usually no reflection in c++ so no return of classes.
2011-07-03T20:55:04  <jmcarthur> those optimizations benefit more from haskell's purity that from its type system
2011-07-03T20:55:06  <mcstar> or is it rather correctness?
2011-07-03T20:55:27  <jmcarthur> tight control over side effects helps the compiler a lot
2011-07-03T20:55:28  <mleise> mcstar: function pointers can be returned of course.
2011-07-03T20:55:42  <mcstar> mleise: yeah that i know, i did it in c
2011-07-03T20:56:02  <jmcarthur> yeah, it's that it's easier to prove the correctness of these transformations with purity
2011-07-03T20:56:25  <jmcarthur> even without purity, though, higher level combinators and stuff can be helpful to a compiler
2011-07-03T20:57:00  <mcstar> from my brief experience i would say that the lisp compilers are pretty advanced
2011-07-03T20:57:08  <jmcarthur> i don't know lisp all that well, but i'm sure that lisp macros alone enable some pretty cool optimizations, right? in that you can automate certain kinds of transformations programmatically?
2011-07-03T20:57:09  <mleise> mcstar: now the trouble is if you return something like a list object which contains large structs, the whole list and its contents is copied by calling the copy constructor
2011-07-03T20:57:22  <jmcarthur> haskell is lacking in the macro area

2011-07-03T20:59:23  <jmcarthur> sure
2011-07-03T20:59:26  <mcstar> you can hide complex code in them
2011-07-03T20:59:54  <jmcarthur> are there commonly any mechanisms for introducing "rewrite rules" for the compiler?
2011-07-03T21:00:09  <jbrechtel> The scala starter package crashes when I submit it.  I suspect it's actually not compiling based on what I see when running the server locally.
2011-07-03T21:00:19  <jmcarthur> like if some macro expansions reveal an opportunity to replace some pattern with a more efficient version of it?
2011-07-03T21:00:40  <jbrechtel> I was hoping to submit a pull request to fix it, but I'm at my wits end.
2011-07-03T21:00:48  <jmcarthur> this is one of the key optimizations in ghc (replacing macro expansion with inlining)
2011-07-03T21:00:56  <mcstar> you can test argument-types, and behave accordingly even in macro expansion time
