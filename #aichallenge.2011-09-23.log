2011-09-23T04:56:52  <delt0r_> x_m is the mode

2011-09-23T04:57:23  <delt0r_> and alpha is the shape

2011-09-23T04:58:51  <delt0r_> you should probably catch NaN --even thou the probability is 1/(2^56) since real random numbers are not totally random

2011-09-23T10:49:41  <olexs1> thing is, my bot determines how long his "complex" part needs only after running it a few times, then it can tweak it to take less time
2011-09-23T10:49:58  <olexs1> if the first run is longer than the 500ms given, there's no mechanism to prevent a timeout
2011-09-23T10:50:37  <mleise> Wow, the first turns you see nothing much, just your ant and some of the map. How can you possibly time out? :)
2011-09-23T10:51:01  <olexs1> it'll be the first battle simulation
2011-09-23T10:51:02  <mleise> well... there should also be a food item
2011-09-23T10:51:39  <olexs1> I build a search tree, first time with a "maximum" depth. afterwards, I can limit the depth to shorten the search

2011-09-23T10:52:57  <mleise> You should do anything as artificial as that (not depending on what is actually on the map) in the loading phase - unless you use a VM language
2011-09-23T10:53:14  <mleise> You get 3 seconds there to do your stuff
2011-09-23T10:53:33  <olexs1> I could try that, indeed
2011-09-23T10:54:26  <olexs1> or I could just check the time in the tree building algorithm and cut it off dynamically, instead of only shortening the depth at search initialization

2011-09-23T11:06:32  <mcstar> i see
2011-09-23T11:06:50  <olexs1> it's classic minimax state-space search with alpha-beta cutoff
2011-09-23T11:07:09  <mcstar> how many ants do you consider?
2011-09-23T11:07:16  <mcstar> n vs. m
2011-09-23T11:08:07  <olexs1> as many as there are in a certain area. I do a fast recursive search around the first pair of my_ant-enemy_ant, looking for any more ants in a reasonable radius
2011-09-23T11:08:42  <olexs1> those are then treated as an isolated situation, I simulate possible moves and evaluate the results down to a certain depth
2011-09-23T11:09:24  <mcstar> so it seems its pretty costly
2011-09-23T11:09:36  <mcstar> do you consider many turns?
2011-09-23T11:09:50  <olexs1> initial search depth is currently 6 plies, which is 3 turns
2011-09-23T11:09:52  <mcstar> im new to this game-tree stuff
2011-09-23T11:09:59  <mcstar> i dont really know the practical limits
2011-09-23T11:10:40  <olexs1> yes, it is pretty costly, and I'm looking for places to optimize it. alpha-beta cutoff was a good one
2011-09-23T11:10:47  <mcstar> so you pick the branch that minimizes your maximum loss?
2011-09-23T11:11:08  <olexs1> yes
2011-09-23T11:11:53  <olexs1> evaluation function is based around "enemy_ants_killed - my_ants_lost", with a few heuristic additions to that
2011-09-23T11:12:14  <mcstar> but this kind of logic can only lead to good local decisions
2011-09-23T11:12:20  <mcstar> do you have global strategies?
2011-09-23T11:12:40  <olexs1> I do, but it's not quite finished yet
2011-09-23T11:12:41  <mcstar> i mean for example ants far apart collaborating
2011-09-23T11:12:46  <mcstar> ok
2011-09-23T11:13:30  <olexs1> I have a sort of a grid covering the area that is "secure" to see and fetch spawned food asap, and ants that would otherwise idle go join ongoing battles or explore unseen terrain
2011-09-23T11:14:11  <olexs1> initial exploration needs some work, I've written some stuff down and will code it in the next few days
2011-09-23T11:14:40  <mcstar> for the inflation phase i use a time-delyed influence map

2011-09-23T11:18:09  <olexs1> don't have any classes right now, and the bot is actually related to uni work, so yes, I've put some time into it
2011-09-23T11:19:04  <mcstar> is it a term-assignment? or what?(if you dont mind my asking)
2011-09-23T11:19:17  <olexs1> it's part of my bachelor thesis
2011-09-23T11:19:48  <mcstar> what is the required final ranking for a succesful thesis?
2011-09-23T11:19:52  <olexs1> I'm doing some AI stuff, and this should be the practical application to demonstrate :)
2011-09-23T11:20:27  <mcstar> i see, so you must have a secret weapon
2011-09-23T11:20:32  <olexs1> no requirements, my prof is very liberal with the whole thing. But a high ranking should help with good marks :)

2011-09-23T12:09:37  <olexs1> ok, I'll give it a go
2011-09-23T12:09:45  <mleise> you should really give berak some time to fix the server. right now it doesn't look like anything that could be released
2011-09-23T12:13:04  <olexs1> well, it seems to at least connect and play, which is something
2011-09-23T12:13:38  <_flag> I think it's mostly just the webserver that has problems
2011-09-23T12:13:56  <_flag> But I have no problem waiting for berak
2011-09-23T12:13:57  <olexs1> the game is taking a while, but that's to be expected I guess

2011-09-23T12:15:22  <olexs1> ok, I don't quite understand the result
2011-09-23T12:16:07  <olexs1> it finished before game end, my bot survived (which is odd, considering yours is the #1 currently if I'm right), but my score is lower than yours. does it mean some sort of cutoff?
2011-09-23T12:16:31  <olexs1> ^before game end = before turn 750
2011-09-23T12:17:13  <_flag> I'm not sure why it says it survived, but I seem to have gotten a higher score than you and we didn't reach 750
2011-09-23T12:17:18  <_flag> Mine says it survived too
2011-09-23T12:18:55  <olexs1> survived will be right though, the data I got on the last turn has a lot of ants with player ids 0 and 1
2011-09-23T12:19:11  <olexs1> so it must be some sort of "no progress cutoff"
2011-09-23T12:20:26  <olexs1> trueskill doesn't seem to work, either, no skill is recorded in "Rankings"
2011-09-23T12:21:10  <_flag> Yeah, it seems that the server is incomplete

2011-09-23T12:34:01  <gattschardo> i would complete it, if they say it's okay to add erlang as a language
2011-09-23T12:35:15  <gattschardo> should i ask about that here or rather open an issue on github? any ideas?
2011-09-23T12:35:21  <_flag> I doubt they'll mind, most of the starter packages written so far were from people outside the main developers

2011-09-23T12:41:08  <gattschardo> janzert: erlang-base looks fine
2011-09-23T12:41:57  <gattschardo> the bots run from the same directory they are compiled in?
2011-09-23T12:42:06  <janzert> basically yes
2011-09-23T12:43:24  <janzert> the other part is https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py needs erlang added in the array of languages starting at line 264
2011-09-23T12:44:10  <gattschardo> k
2011-09-23T12:45:40  <janzert> one other thought is I know erlang is known for it's parallel programming, contest submissions are supposed to restrict themselves to using a single main thread of processing, is there an option for erlang to not use multiple OS threads or processes?

2011-09-23T12:46:52  <gattschardo> afaik that depends on how the erlang vm is compiled
2011-09-23T12:47:33  <gattschardo> so there is basically no way to stop the user from using user-level-threads, but depending on how the vm is compiled they will all run in the same OS thread
2011-09-23T12:47:49  <_flag> berak: I'm running your tcp server here: http://flagcapper.com:2080/, it seems to work fairly well so far although the visualizer was missing a file
2011-09-23T12:48:00  <berak> ;)
2011-09-23T12:48:15  <janzert> is this message talking about the same VM as Ubuntu uses? http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2010-September/053328.html
2011-09-23T12:48:26  <janzert> if so it looks like a +S option might do it
2011-09-23T12:48:31  <_flag> Also I think the webserver part seems to hang sometimes
2011-09-23T12:49:02  <janzert> anyway that can be played with once the basics are implemented
2011-09-23T12:49:43  <gattschardo> the manpage says "-smp disable" does it
2011-09-23T12:49:52  <gattschardo> maybe +S is a short form for that
2011-09-23T12:50:04  <janzert> http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html
2011-09-23T12:50:17  <gattschardo> nice to know it doesn't need to be recompiled
2011-09-23T12:50:39  <janzert> +S sets the amount of scheduler threads, which seem to be erlang speak for OS level threads :}

2011-09-23T12:51:35  <gattschardo> also +hms might be useful to limit the heap size

2011-09-23T16:11:37  <gattschardo> is MyBot hardcoded im some place?
2011-09-23T16:11:41  <janzert> yes
2011-09-23T16:11:45  <janzert> I just saw that go by
2011-09-23T16:12:30  <janzert> the compiler output is expected to produce a Mybot.extension file
2011-09-23T16:12:42  <janzert> where .extension is given as the second Language parameter
2011-09-23T16:12:52  <janzert> err, MyBot.extension
2011-09-23T16:12:58  <janzert> hmm
2011-09-23T16:13:42  <gattschardo> is that because of the targetCompiler?
2011-09-23T16:14:25  <janzert> no, the check is at line 416 and 417 of compiler.py
2011-09-23T16:14:41  <gattschardo> ah, i see
2011-09-23T16:15:04  <gattschardo> we could make another compiler pass that simply touches MyBot.beam
2011-09-23T16:15:13  <janzert> not sure why it was done that except that every other language can produce a MyBot.something file :(

2011-09-23T16:15:50  <janzert> well the right thing to do would be to look for a my_bot.beam file, right?
2011-09-23T16:16:02  <gattschardo> yes, that would be the real fix
2011-09-23T16:17:21  <janzert> pretty sure that is the only place Language.extension is used, think I'll just change it to Language.out_file
2011-09-23T16:17:56  <janzert> touches a fair number of lines but is a fairly simple change in logic
2011-09-23T16:21:23  <gattschardo> easier than changing all the other languages to "myBot" for sure ;)
