2011-10-24T00:00:16  <burny> just like what an optimizer does, to c++ code
2011-10-24T00:00:29  <teryret> it's different though
2011-10-24T00:00:29  <jmcarthur> i think what you claim is in NP
2011-10-24T00:00:48  <teryret> optimizers look for patterns and replace them with known replacements
2011-10-24T00:00:49  <a1k0n> oof.  os x lion terminal limits scrollback by default "to available memory"
2011-10-24T00:00:51  <burny> yes, determining the BEST one is np
2011-10-24T00:01:01  <a1k0n> which is painful when running a bot in the background
2011-10-24T00:01:06  <jmcarthur> even determining a good one is
2011-10-24T00:01:08  <burny> but determining a combination of suitable things, isn't np
2011-10-24T00:01:33  <burny> and, part of the design can include "use bubble sort" or "figure out how it should be sorted yourself" etc.
2011-10-24T00:01:45  <teryret> a1k0n, you're not using iTerm?
2011-10-24T00:02:34  <jmcarthur> i don't think any particular algorithm belongs in a specification
2011-10-24T00:02:39  <lrh9> Sounds more to me like an a.i. programmer. Which I wouldn't mind having.
2011-10-24T00:02:58  <teryret> you're in a room full of ai programmers! ;-)
2011-10-24T00:03:05  <lrh9> Hahaha.
2011-10-24T00:03:22  <lrh9> I should say: a artificially intelligent programmer.
2011-10-24T00:03:45  <burny> if the programming language I want, existed.. the code for this game would look something like this to start..
2011-10-24T00:03:57  <teryret> which then raises the question, how much of intelligence is learned
2011-10-24T00:04:28  <burny> parse_input();   update_board();  for each ant: choose(best_move) from available_moves();
2011-10-24T00:04:33  <jmcarthur> i can specify what a sort function should mean without explaining how it works. this distinction between meaning and implementation is what makes the spec more declarative than the implementation.
2011-10-24T00:04:48  <burny> and you would get a compile error: that "choose(best_move)", is insufficiently designed

2011-10-24T00:05:06  <teryret> it might not be possible to specify intelligence, in which case creating an artificial one would be impossible, we could only create an artificial mechanism that naturally learns to be intelligent
2011-10-24T00:05:08  <jmcarthur> your design looks an awful lot like code

2011-10-24T00:07:58  <teryret> do it in a lisp, that way you get to specify the language to work however you want
2011-10-24T00:08:01  <jmcarthur> explain the game declaratively, then write a formula in terms of the game and declare that the AI should maximize the value of that formula

2011-10-24T00:09:02  <burny> that sounds more like a design for the 'choose' function
2011-10-24T00:09:53  <jmcarthur> it sounds like you are using "design" to mean "architecture", whereas i was interpreting it as "specification"
2011-10-24T00:10:14  <burny> all the same thing

2011-10-24T00:12:47  <AndrewBC> wtf, how did they all...
2011-10-24T00:13:04  <teryret> they all walked into their team mates
2011-10-24T00:13:12  <AndrewBC> at the same position
2011-10-24T00:13:26  <AndrewBC> symmetrically and relatively
2011-10-24T00:13:29  <jmcarthur> they are just all starter bots
2011-10-24T00:13:43  <jmcarthur> they all did the exact same thing because they *are* the exact same thing
2011-10-24T00:13:47  <AndrewBC> Oh I guess the seed is the same for every bot?
2011-10-24T00:13:58  <lrh9> I'm adding a signal based concept to my bot. Ants move onto the tile with the weakest signal to explore in that direction. When they move onto it, they increase the signal so other ants are less likely to follow. Each turn, the signal for each tile decrements towards zero. That way ants can reexplore if need be.
2011-10-24T00:13:58  <jmcarthur> those bots didn't use any randomness
2011-10-24T00:14:03  <teryret> or they're not written to call random at all
2011-10-24T00:14:26  <AndrewBC> oh, I seem to recall my starter bot did
2011-10-24T00:14:37  <AndrewBC> weird
2011-10-24T00:14:46  <teryret> oh I do'nt know if those are starter bots
2011-10-24T00:14:55  <jmcarthur> lrh9: so "signal" just means "time since last visited"?
2011-10-24T00:15:30  <lrh9> In that case yes.
2011-10-24T00:15:41  <teryret> lrh9, so my question is, what are you hoping to have happen by this, or are you just trying it to see what will happen?
2011-10-24T00:16:34  <jmcarthur> i think the point is to seek food more effectively
2011-10-24T00:16:37  <lrh9> Just experimenting.
2011-10-24T00:16:42  <lrh9> To explore more effectively.
2011-10-24T00:16:48  <jmcarthur> by making sure that areas don't go unseen for too long

2011-10-24T00:17:17  <lrh9> I'm going to have food put out a positive signal in a certain radius. Weak at the edges and strong at the center. Ants will naturally move towards the signal and hopefully collect the food.
2011-10-24T00:17:46  <jmcarthur> neat idea
2011-10-24T00:17:58  <lrh9> Naturally inspired.
2011-10-24T00:17:59  <lrh9> (Ants.)
2011-10-24T00:18:12  <jmcarthur> but slightly different
2011-10-24T00:18:12  <lrh9> I'd even like to apply the concept to hills and ants.
2011-10-24T00:18:18  <lrh9> Yep.
2011-10-24T00:18:47  <teryret> I'm confused, how are you going to get the food put off a smell?
2011-10-24T00:18:59  <teryret> wouldn't being able to do that imply already knowing where the food is?
2011-10-24T00:19:11  <teryret> which would happen by having sent a scout near it
2011-10-24T00:19:41  <lrh9> Yes. I'll know the location of the food.
2011-10-24T00:20:09  <teryret> oh, so you're just hill climbing as your path planning algorithm
2011-10-24T00:20:11  <teryret> I see
2011-10-24T00:20:13  <AndrewBC> yes, however if you see something across an obstacle, and make the radius of the signal larger on the map than sight radius, ants on the other side of the obstacle would be able to go to it
2011-10-24T00:20:37  <AndrewBC> that's one scenario where it would be an emergent advantage to the naive "route nearest ant to it"

2011-10-24T00:21:34  <lrh9> I have an implementation of the "exploration signals". It's just that my ants occassionally collide even though I'm using a data structure to keep track of target destinations each turn.
2011-10-24T00:21:39  <teryret> I agree, but updating smell is an m*n algorithm, and if you're clever you can do better than that via other means
2011-10-24T00:21:58  <AndrewBC> agreed

2011-10-24T00:22:33  <AndrewBC> If we had to carry the food back to base, it might be a different story
2011-10-24T00:22:42  <AndrewBC> but even then you can do things like a minimum spanning tree
2011-10-24T00:22:55  <lrh9> Seems relatively simple to implement though. Adapt the vision code to produce the signal strengths and ant movement is simply a matter of picking the best neighbor based on its signal strength.
2011-10-24T00:23:01  <AndrewBC> and the food is singular instead of a large source
2011-10-24T00:23:14  <lrh9> Yeah. That's why I had to tweak it.
2011-10-24T00:23:16  <AndrewBC> yeah I'd be interested in seeing it in action

2011-10-24T03:03:10  <Tommygun> Im having trouble figuring out how to check visibility
2011-10-24T03:03:11  *** cybsy <cybsy!~Cyb@client-86-23-118-104.brhm.adsl.virginmedia.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2011-10-24T03:03:20  <Tommygun> using java
2011-10-24T03:03:26  <Tommygun> the tutorial didn't mention it
2011-10-24T03:04:07  <Tommygun> Anyone?
2011-10-24T03:04:13  <Puj> Tommygun, there is a method called "visible" in the python starter package, it might help to check that out first.  You may just be able to recode it in Java
2011-10-24T03:04:21  <Puj> That is in ants.py
2011-10-24T03:04:47  <AndrewBC> ah hmm, the coffee breaks are when my ants get "stuck" together
2011-10-24T03:04:49  <Tommygun> Visible isn't coded in the java ants ?
2011-10-24T03:05:05  <Puj> Dunno, can check.. Tommygun
2011-10-24T03:05:05  <Tommygun> balls.
2011-10-24T03:05:17  <Tommygun> So ill have to go dl the python pack'
2011-10-24T03:05:34  <_flag> Check to see if a square is within the view radius of any of your ants
2011-10-24T03:05:38  <_flag> If it is, it is visible
2011-10-24T03:05:41  <_flag> If it isn't, it isn't

2011-10-24T03:05:57  <paul__> Tommygun, what do you mean by check visibility?
2011-10-24T03:07:17  <Puj> Tommygun, _flag is right if that's what you are after, but the python package has a good example of how to precalculate that for all of the ants and only do lookups based on the precalculation table.  That's a good method if you are going to be doing more than one visibility check per turn.
2011-10-24T03:07:49  <Tommygun> I was coding that precalc table you're talking about puj
2011-10-24T03:07:57  <Puj> Okay.

2011-10-24T03:08:15  <Tommygun> was trying to get this visibility based on whether or not each tile had an associated Ilk
2011-10-24T03:08:49  <Tommygun> because, I figure that the game must have sent me all of the Ilk for the tiles I can see
2011-10-24T03:08:55  <Tommygun> but not the tiles I can't
2011-10-24T03:09:02  <Tommygun> therefore, visibility
2011-10-24T03:09:24  <Tommygun> but I can't check the double array without it crashing
2011-10-24T03:09:24  <paul__> What do you mean by Ilk?
2011-10-24T03:09:26  <lericson> Ilk?

2011-10-24T03:09:37  <Puj> Ilk is like a Tile class in the Java solution
2011-10-24T03:09:38  <Tommygun> Ilk is a java file to denote water, land dead ant ect
2011-10-24T03:09:38  <jtamer> ilk == tile type
2011-10-24T03:09:53  <paul__> ah
2011-10-24T03:10:06  <lericson> the server doesn't send tile types like that, it sends relevant data
2011-10-24T03:10:37  <Tommygun> How come I can look up if a visible tile has water then?
2011-10-24T03:10:48  <lericson> you can look that up even after vision fades
2011-10-24T03:11:05  <paul__> I have the algorithm for calculating exactly which coordinates are visible around an ant. is that what you mean?
2011-10-24T03:11:27  <jtamer> it sounds like he wants to know whether or not he's seen a particular square before, and if so, if it was land or water.
2011-10-24T03:11:39  <Tommygun> Okay, let me clarify
2011-10-24T03:12:14  <Tommygun> I want a few things: A) visible tiles
2011-10-24T03:12:37  <Tommygun> B)  to investigate the actual data given to me
2011-10-24T03:13:12  <Tommygun> I want to know if all of the water tiles in existence are given to me
2011-10-24T03:13:33  <paul__> for (A) you need to calculate what the visible coordinates are around each live ant you have
2011-10-24T03:13:55  <AndrewBC> git status
2011-10-24T03:13:58  <AndrewBC> .. bah
2011-10-24T03:14:05  <Tommygun> right, and Im assuming the only way to do that is via ant radius
2011-10-24T03:14:27  <Tommygun> not too challenging, but I'm thinking about how to do that another way
2011-10-24T03:14:34  <Tommygun> via the tile types given to me
2011-10-24T03:15:26  <Tommygun> Since each tile is not directly linked to it's type, I should be able to get all of the type info which is sent to me
2011-10-24T03:16:26  <Tommygun> would probably help if the java docs were in front of you guys :D

2011-10-24T03:18:22  <paul__> if a hill tile disappears (as in it's razed) then info on that tile won't be sent to you the next turn because it's now empty land. The only way to know a hill disappeared is to make note of the fact that the tile is visible yet no info was sent on it.
2011-10-24T03:18:54  <paul__> i'm not sure if that's related to what you're trying to do, but that's i'm working on right now
2011-10-24T03:19:30  <Tommygun> absolutely what I am talking about
2011-10-24T03:19:44  <Tommygun> does that mean all of the water tiles are available to be looked at?
2011-10-24T03:19:58  <question_> when i run test_bot.cmd on my submission i get turn 0 bot 1 crashed
2011-10-24T03:20:16  <paul__> Water tiles are only sent once: the first time they are visible
2011-10-24T03:20:21  <Tommygun> then your bot crashed
2011-10-24T03:20:28  <Puj> question_, Check your game_logs/ for a file called 0.bot0.error

2011-10-24T03:21:50  <Tommygun> cool.  Well in java, you check the tile's "Ilk"
2011-10-24T03:21:56  <Tommygun> through a method in ants
2011-10-24T03:22:03  <question_> and the other part says no encoding declared
2011-10-24T03:22:16  <Tommygun> what that method does, is checks a double array
2011-10-24T03:22:20  <Puj> Hi paul__
2011-10-24T03:22:25  <Tommygun> and returns the Ilk for that location
2011-10-24T03:22:52  <paul__> which is your chosen language, Puj?
2011-10-24T03:22:57  <Puj> What question_?   What language are you using and what are you running?

2011-10-24T03:26:18  <paul__> Tommygun: I'm keeping track of the how many turns ago each tile was last seen, so a value of 0 would mean it's visible this turn.  I increment this value for all tiles at the end of a turn, and at the start of a turn I iterate through all of my ants, calculate the tiles they can see, and then remove all food, hill, and ant tiles that should be visible but were last seen >= 1 turn ago. If that makes sense...

Make sure you aren't sending any debug outputs to stdout in your program and use the -E flag to put the stderr from your bot into the game_logs directory.  Double check that everything in your .cmd file you reference exists.  gtg

2011-10-24T04:16:59  <csyncope> running make compiles the jar

2011-10-24T04:18:08  <csyncope> are you asking which one or whether i have it installed?
2011-10-24T04:18:46  <Puj> Yeah.  But it looks like the Makefile looks for MyBot.java and compiles to MyBot.jar, thus you should be trying to run MyBot.jar with the initial class being MyBot
2011-10-24T04:18:47  <Alexer> hm, i can be totally off, but i remember someone having a similar problem, and it was caused by him using "java -jar mybot.jar" instead of "java -jar mybot" iirc

2011-10-24T04:19:21  <Alexer> ...apparently totally off
2011-10-24T04:19:41  <csyncope> I don't think so
2011-10-24T04:19:49  <csyncope> i think that's only when compiling .java files pretty sure you have to specify .jar

2011-10-24T04:20:46  <Puj> Well, -jar MyBot.jar should definetly work.  But you might have to specify the package path to the start class as well.  "java -jar MyBot.jar your.package.MyBot
2011-10-24T04:21:01  <Alexer> ah
2011-10-24T04:21:30  <delt0r_> -jar will work if the manifest file is correct
2011-10-24T04:21:40  <Puj> True dat delt0r_

2011-10-24T05:05:13  <paul__> your own ants can be on hills, but can someone else's ant be on your hill? Or does a hill instantly disappear as soon as an enemy ant touches it?
2011-10-24T05:05:47  <mcstar> if it doesnt buffer any ants
2011-10-24T05:06:00  <mcstar> if it does, the enemy ant that is approaching is kileld
2011-10-24T05:07:47  <paul__> mcstar, what do you mean by buffer ants? as in have extra food stored up? does this mean that if you move onto an enemy hill, the enemy has one extra turn to spawn an ant at that hill and kill you?

2011-10-24T05:11:27  <mcstar> if your ant blocks the hill, all the food is buffered

2011-10-24T05:11:56  <mcstar> so, an enemy ant cant destroy a hill until it un-buffered all of its ants
2011-10-24T05:12:05  <mcstar> you can raze an empty hill
2011-10-24T05:12:08  <Puj> But the food is collected even if the hill is blocked, it's the ant which is buffered, correct mcstar?

2011-10-24T05:12:37  <paul__> is this correct? razing = just moving your ant onto an unbuffered hill
2011-10-24T05:12:38  <mcstar> the food disappears from the board

2011-10-24T05:18:37  <mcstar> yeah, i guess they can block the spawning
2011-10-24T05:18:43  <mcstar> you have to be careful
2011-10-24T05:19:27  <Puj> Does an enemy ant block a spawn or does it count as a collision?
2011-10-24T05:19:37  <paul__> that'd be a good attack strategy, block all spawning
2011-10-24T05:20:08  <mcstar> it is a simple attack
2011-10-24T05:20:21  <mcstar> the enemy can kill the ant that is on top of the hill
2011-10-24T05:20:29  <mcstar> and elilminating your buffer 1by1
2011-10-24T05:21:12  <Puj> Would you not have to have two ants within attackradius of the hill to pick them off one-by-one?

2011-10-24T05:22:22  <paul__> wait, so an enemy ant can move into the same tile as your hill and a spawn will count as a collision and they'll both die because theyre both occupying the same tile? but i suppose they can't move onto it to begin with (unless the hill's buffer is empty) because there will always be a spawned ant sitting on it from the buffer

2011-10-24T05:25:35  <Puj> I think it happens in the move phase?
2011-10-24T05:25:40  <Puj> Which is before attack
2011-10-24T05:26:05  <antimatroid> why does food spawning happen before battle?
2011-10-24T05:26:21  <antimatroid> it's not going to change where food will spawn, it'll just make it take an extra turn to spawn there
2011-10-24T05:26:26  <Puj> I thought you meant ant spawning, sorry antimatroid
2011-10-24T05:26:31  <antimatroid> if an enemy resides there that dies during battle

2011-10-24T05:27:27  <paul__> spawn happens last, according to the Game Specification link. Move happens first.  So that means it's impossible for an enemy ant to move onto a 'buffered' hill.
2011-10-24T05:28:08  <paul__> i'm assuming it means ant spawn happens last

2011-10-24T05:29:41  <AndrewBC> the first turn is ~ 66ms on my machine
2011-10-24T05:29:55  <delt0r_> that still sounds wrong unless you have massive contention
2011-10-24T05:30:00  <Puj> Me too...  But sporadically..  Yeah, my turns are all under 100ms it seems according to printouts and profiling...
2011-10-24T05:30:03  <AndrewBC> I also have weird long turns every now and then, I think go's GC is shit
2011-10-24T05:30:04  <delt0r_> semaphores are fast
2011-10-24T05:30:14  <AndrewBC> long being like 30ms
2011-10-24T05:30:15  <delt0r_> if it does not block of course

2011-10-24T05:30:36  <AndrewBC> Puj: it does timeout on the server though, first turn
2011-10-24T05:30:37  <AndrewBC> :/
2011-10-24T05:30:43  <Abrackadabra> how should i use tcp server by accoun?
2011-10-24T05:31:00  <Abrackadabra> python tcpclient.py 213.88.39.97 2081 "java -jar bot/MyBot.jar" username password 1 doesn't work
2011-10-24T05:31:25  <Puj> That sucks...  maybe you can succeed where I failed earlier.  Do you have the possibility to handle the SIGTERM signal in Go and then throw a stacktrace?  I tried it in Python earlier, but failed miserably.
2011-10-24T05:31:44  <Puj> You have to change the signal sent to the bot in playgame as well.  I think it's actually in sandbox.py around line 398
2011-10-24T05:31:55  <paul__> why would it timeout on the server but finish so fast locally?
2011-10-24T05:32:19  <delt0r_> paul__: tcp

2011-10-24T05:33:39  <AndrewBC> paul__: according to my local test script, 66ms is a timeout
2011-10-24T05:33:56  <delt0r_> that does sound very wrong
2011-10-24T05:34:03  <delt0r_> should be like about 500ms
2011-10-24T05:34:03  <AndrewBC> maybe I'm not timing it correctly
2011-10-24T05:34:04  <Puj> Ugh.. It's about the same here.
2011-10-24T05:34:13  <paul__> i thought the standard turn timeout is 1000 milliseconds
2011-10-24T05:34:51  <delt0r_> I think that is the time out locally
2011-10-24T05:34:53  <Puj> Although... it could be that playgame.py does something wrong while blocking for input causing it to interpret the lag as computation time in our bots.
2011-10-24T05:34:55  <delt0r_> aka in tools
2011-10-24T05:35:04  <AndrewBC> Puj: true

2011-10-24T05:41:05  <Puj> The profiler indicates that all cpu cycles are basically spent in the method which is responsible for handling input from the server (playgame.py), not in my computation code..

2011-10-24T05:46:11  <AndrewBC> +/-. The loop uses time.sleep(0.01) That call can return early if python wakes to handle a signal
2011-10-24T05:46:13  <antimatroid> that's where it really matters
2011-10-24T05:46:18  <antimatroid> or whatever
2011-10-24T05:46:28  <delt0r_> also with task scheduling can also mean odd time patterns.
2011-10-24T05:46:36  <AndrewBC> it is however, the proper way to do accurate sleeping in python
2011-10-24T05:46:45  <AndrewBC> won't use unix's crappy inaccurate one

2011-10-24T05:54:49  <mcstar> you are not linking cygwin in
2011-10-24T05:55:09  <mcstar> that doesnt matter, you issue "go" in your program
2011-10-24T05:55:21  <mcstar> i.e. fully windows if you compile it on windows
2011-10-24T05:55:31  <delt0r_> mcstar: but without a linebreak its not sent
2011-10-24T05:55:32  <Puj> It's being interpreted via cygwin
2011-10-24T05:55:44  <delt0r_> hell even the server my need the linebreak

2011-10-24T05:57:10  <mcstar> so you saying bash is compiled against the cygwin dll, that in turn changes line breaks to "\r\n", and you have to use that in your program
2011-10-24T05:57:24  <mcstar> this way it makes a little sense

2011-10-24T05:58:19  <mcstar> it doesnt make sense theoretically, but experimentall it does
2011-10-24T05:58:45  <delt0r_> cygwin on windows is trying to make everything unix like, it could well be mangling linebreaks as part of that

2011-10-24T05:59:24  <mcstar> but when you run your program outside bash, i.e. with cmd, normal line breaks should work

2011-10-24T06:23:14  <paul__> AndrewBC: After the initialization stuff (turn 0, viewradius2, etc, etc) then it receives "ready".  In one part of the documentation, it says your bot should respond with "ready".  In another part of the site, it says your bot should respond with "go"
2011-10-24T06:23:26  <AndrewBC> ...
2011-10-24T06:24:02  <paul__> I was responding with "ready", because that seemed like newer info, but the test script was looking for "go", so i would just time out everytime
2011-10-24T06:24:11  <AndrewBC> lame, haha

2011-10-24T06:27:38  <paul__> ??
2011-10-24T06:27:55  <AndrewBC> if my ant doesn't see food, it'll look for unknown area to explore. If it doesn't succeed the first time, it searches a little bit further away for unexplored area
2011-10-24T06:28:10  <AndrewBC> I did a logarithmic endless increase in that
2011-10-24T06:28:31  <AndrewBC> the test map, however, is so small that there isn't any unexplored area that he hits

2011-10-24T06:51:40  <AndrewBC> paul__: yeah, I dunno
2011-10-24T06:51:44  <Israfel> Or maybe it's HunterBot.py
2011-10-24T06:51:52  <Israfel> I'll try other bots.
2011-10-24T06:52:29  <mcstar> no, its the javabot
2011-10-24T06:53:13  <Israfel> yeah, it's a java error, but does the bot check the input to make sure it's valid?
2011-10-24T06:53:56  <mcstar> Israfel: anyway, if you dont use a jar it works
2011-10-24T06:54:51  <mcstar> i guess it doesnt work with a jar, because thats not what playgame.py expects ,and it mangles the command you give
2011-10-24T06:54:54  <mcstar> or some like that
2011-10-24T06:55:18  <mcstar> just make a script that launches your class, with the correct classpath and give that script to playgame.py

2011-10-24T07:24:16  <AndrewBC> goroutines are multiplexed on top of threads and work just fine when there's only 1 thread

2011-10-24T07:43:42  <Six> personally, I think ants should be kept in a dictionairy and you should name each of them
2011-10-24T07:44:32  <Six> there is a certain irony to the fact I generally spell dictionary wrong
2011-10-24T07:44:49  <Puj> Hehe
2011-10-24T07:45:19  <mcstar> the irony is that people refer to a type of data container as a "dictionary", and expect others to understand what he/she is talking about
2011-10-24T07:45:53  <AndrewBC> it's a bit more indicative of function than "hash table"
2011-10-24T07:46:27  <AndrewBC> normal people would think that meant a large breakfast banquet for truckers, or something like that
2011-10-24T07:46:35  <AndrewBC> or maybe pot, I dunno
2011-10-24T07:46:38  <Puj> Irony is putting a considered data type in quotations like a string literal while critizing names for data types which most people would recognize.
2011-10-24T07:46:57  <AndrewBC> stupid strings
2011-10-24T07:47:16  <AndrewBC> think about that name
2011-10-24T07:47:17  <mcstar> the data container we are talking about is commonly called hashtable
2011-10-24T07:47:19  <AndrewBC> how absurd it is

2011-10-24T07:50:16  <GeorgeJ> Hash table, do you not mean a map? or a key=>value store?
2011-10-24T07:50:27  <AndrewBC> ameydhar: I've been waiting for an hour for a game with my new submission
2011-10-24T07:50:43  <mcstar> GeorgeJ: a dictionary is implemented as a hashtable
2011-10-24T07:50:55  <mcstar> a map doesnt say anything about its implementation
2011-10-24T07:50:58  <ameydhar> mine also it has been about 90 mins
2011-10-24T07:50:59  <Puj> Don't wait ameydhar, just keep coding  and testing locally
2011-10-24T07:51:03  <GeorgeJ> Exactly
2011-10-24T07:51:10  <AndrewBC> there are also tcp servers
2011-10-24T07:51:14  <Puj> +1 mcstar
2011-10-24T07:51:17  <GeorgeJ> A map is basicaly a key =>  value store
2011-10-24T07:51:19  <AndrewBC> I've played like 20 games on one of them already
2011-10-24T07:51:27  <ameydhar> And if I have many submissions, will the last submitted code be evaluated?

2011-10-24T07:52:43  <Puj> C#?
2011-10-24T07:52:50  <mcstar> but it is nitpicking, i know
2011-10-24T07:53:00  <ameydhar> if I have many submissions, will the last submitted code be evaluated?
2011-10-24T07:53:11  <ameydhar> or all of them?
2011-10-24T07:53:17  <AndrewBC> mcstar: you shouldn't say hash table anymore :D
2011-10-24T07:53:25  <mcstar> not one of them
2011-10-24T07:53:31  <cyphase> ameydhar, last submitted
2011-10-24T07:53:39  <Six> I don't even know python, and for some reason that was the word I decided to use
2011-10-24T07:53:45  <mcstar> it is not going to be evaluated, it isnt an expression
2011-10-24T07:53:47  <ameydhar> thanks
2011-10-24T07:54:05  <mcstar> lets say, it will be run
2011-10-24T07:54:05  <cyphase> ameydhar, unless it had a problem. so last submitted working code i suppose
2011-10-24T07:54:32  <ameydhar> No both are showing ready to play. No problem in both I suppose

2011-10-24T07:55:47  <mcstar> in a greater sense you can say, your bot will be evaluated, for example, its performance will be evaluated, but before all that it will be compiled or/and run

2011-10-24T09:08:44  <mcstar> that accent
2011-10-24T09:10:50  <mcstar> the probability of having head,p or tail(1-p) is obviously continuous
2011-10-24T09:11:08  <mcstar> p \el [0,1]
2011-10-24T09:11:42  <mcstar> stochastic? what is?
2011-10-24T09:12:08  <mcstar> this probability only depends upon the manufacturing of the coin
2011-10-24T09:12:10  <RedJoy> stochastic = random
2011-10-24T09:12:17  <mcstar> i know what that means
2011-10-24T09:12:21  <mcstar> but what is random?
2011-10-24T09:12:26  <mcstar> p is not random
2011-10-24T09:12:44  <mcstar> the flipping of the coin is a stochastic process
2011-10-24T09:12:56  <mcstar> you dont know what will happen, head or tail
2011-10-24T09:13:07  <mcstar> but the probability of it is constant
2011-10-24T09:13:34  <mcstar> adversarial? i have no idea what that means

2011-10-24T09:47:38  <Raelifin> Hello, I was wondering if someone could help me get the tools working. I'm using linux, and my bot works on the server.
2011-10-24T09:48:13  <Raelifin> My bot is in Java and I think it has to do with the classpath.
2011-10-24T09:48:19  <Puj> Okay

2011-10-24T09:49:09  <Raelifin> Puj: thanks
2011-10-24T09:49:44  <Puj> What kind of problem are you experiencing Raelifin?
2011-10-24T09:50:10  <Raelifin> Puj: I have everything downloaded, and I go into the terminal and run test_bot.sh
2011-10-24T09:50:46  <Raelifin> It's my understanding that I need to provide the path to MyBot.java as an arg
2011-10-24T09:51:06  <Raelifin> so something like: ./test_bot.sh "java ../src/MyBot.java"
2011-10-24T09:51:26  <Raelifin> And I get
2011-10-24T09:51:30  <Raelifin> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: //MyBot/java
2011-10-24T09:51:34  <Puj> Well, the best approach thusfar with the java users is using the makefile to create a jar file and then running something along the lines of "java -jar MyBot.jar"
2011-10-24T09:51:49  <Raelifin> Ah, interesting

2011-10-24T09:52:00  <Raelifin> Let me try that...
2011-10-24T09:52:11  <Puj> Well, that's because the java executable expects classes as arguments, not java files.  That is, compiled classes.  So it assumes MyBot is a package name pointing to a class named MyBot
2011-10-24T09:52:50  <sir_macelon> Raelifin: you shouldn't execute "java" files, but compiled "class" files instead
2011-10-24T09:53:25  <Raelifin> I tried that.
2011-10-24T09:53:28  <Raelifin> To no luck
2011-10-24T09:53:38  <sir_macelon> Raelifin: change it rather to "java -cp ../bin MyBot"
2011-10-24T09:54:07  <sir_macelon> if you have your class files in the ../bin folder
2011-10-24T09:54:56  <Raelifin> That worked!
2011-10-24T09:55:04  <Raelifin> Thanks, sir_macelon!

2011-10-24T10:06:34  <Puj> Well KD-trees are usually better for locations which are mostly static right?  I mean you would have to recreate the KD-tree each turn assuming all of your ants moved...
2011-10-24T10:07:02  <Fluxid> hm, right
2011-10-24T10:07:25  <Fluxid> or maybe i'll rewrite my bot in c++ instead of python
2011-10-24T10:07:43  <Puj> lolz, too slow?
2011-10-24T10:07:44  <Fluxid> managing 80 ants takes more than 500ms :|
2011-10-24T10:07:58  <Fluxid> yeah, but with current idea i have in mind
2011-10-24T10:08:04  <Puj> Have you profiled?
2011-10-24T10:08:08  <Fluxid> before it was like 120ms max
2011-10-24T10:08:12  <Fluxid> yup
2011-10-24T10:08:15  <Fluxid> looking into it
2011-10-24T10:08:18  <Puj> k
2011-10-24T10:09:22  <Fluxid> well, not looking for closest ant is the problem, but pathfinding... 90% of time
2011-10-24T10:09:53  <Fluxid> damn
2011-10-24T10:10:08  <Puj> I think a suboptimal approach would be ironically optimal
2011-10-24T10:10:20  <Puj> Only choose a few points to do pathfinding on each turn.
2011-10-24T10:10:32  <Puj> Save those paths
2011-10-24T10:10:41  <Puj> And only update a few points off the path per turn.
2011-10-24T10:10:56  <Fluxid> it turns out i'm pathfinding over 32 times a turn
2011-10-24T10:11:04  <Fluxid> i wonder why, it should be 3 at most

Is there a well-known way to handle ant combat?  I only know of the so-called "min-max" approach, which is computationally impossible in the timeframe we get...

2011-10-24T10:16:49  <Craklyn_> I think that's a starcraft or other RTS joke, but maybe it's not?
2011-10-24T10:16:53  <Puj> Totally
2011-10-24T10:17:12  <Puj> But only kind of a joke.
2011-10-24T10:17:14  <Puj> Not entirely.
2011-10-24T10:17:31  <Craklyn_> In what ways is it not a joke?
2011-10-24T10:18:04  <Puj> Well, if there are too many enemies you back up to prevent taking damage and let the enemies get out of formation then attack then repeat.
2011-10-24T10:18:44  <lericson> does the enemy have to get out of position?
2011-10-24T10:18:54  <Craklyn_> Yeah, watching the best bots, that was the emergent behavior.  But what is the underlying method that causes it?
2011-10-24T10:18:59  <Puj> It depends on your position and theirs....
2011-10-24T10:19:13  <Fluxid> okay, i'll play 20 games with three versions of my bot via tcp
2011-10-24T10:19:18  <Puj> There can be a bunch of different methods to calculate something that exhibits that behaviour.
2011-10-24T10:19:32  <Puj> But make sure you don't fall into the water while you are backing up ;)

2011-10-24T10:21:21  <Craklyn_> Are you suggesting doing a min-max approach but not looking more than one turn in the future?  If they can conceivably get the upper-hand, then your units back up or act defensively.  If they can't get a superior position in the next turn, then you advance?
2011-10-24T10:21:39  <Puj> Well, I'm being vague because I honestly believe that is where the top competitors are making the most modifications right now and that it will be the most crucial point in this contest...
2011-10-24T10:22:46  <Craklyn_> Why does that cause you to be vague?

2011-10-24T10:31:44  <pedrosorio> also, there's a lot that you need to worry about when developing a bot before you even consider combat
2011-10-24T10:32:08  <Craklyn_> I assume that there's a variety of strategies which are well-known to people who have taken many computer science courses.  I just wanted to know their names so I can be aware of them and maybe hobble together my own version..
2011-10-24T10:32:51  <Craklyn_> My bot gathers food efficiently and explores right now.  Combat seems like it's next to worry about, don't you think?

2011-10-24T10:46:17  <Islacrusez> Heyo
2011-10-24T10:46:46  <Craklyn_> Is food dropping random, or is it deterministic and symmetric for all bases?
2011-10-24T10:46:51  <pedrosorio> the worst is when you know you need to make structural changes, but instead you just do small optimizations and then you need to scrap the code and start over
2011-10-24T10:47:00  <Craklyn_> I.e. can you get unlucky and your base has few new foods appear, while your opponent gets many?
2011-10-24T10:47:19  <sir_macelon> Craklyn_:  no, it's symmetric
2011-10-24T10:47:22  <pedrosorio> I believe in the game description they say it's symmetric
2011-10-24T10:47:26  <pedrosorio> so no luck there
2011-10-24T10:47:36  <pedrosorio> and they also say something about fixed locations

2011-10-24T10:51:05  <pedrosorio> it's just the "next level" in this game
2011-10-24T10:51:14  <pedrosorio> to pay attention to the symmetries
2011-10-24T10:51:39  <Craklyn_> Yeah, I was just thinking that it's weird that if you see one food pop, you know where lots of foods appeared in the game.. :P
2011-10-24T10:51:40  <pedrosorio> and as the number of players grows (i.e. the size of the map grows) it gets more profitable
2011-10-24T10:51:49  <Guest92487> pedrosorio: well, I'm not sure about the food finding... usually there's enough ants around that pretty quickly whenever food appears someone can see it

2011-10-24T10:52:04  <Craklyn_> It could help you early game when the map is more sparse, though
2011-10-24T10:52:07  <Guest92487> and if you can't see food and someone else can, well, they're going to eat it before you can reach it probably
2011-10-24T10:52:24  <pedrosorio> yeah, it's probably not the main advantage
2011-10-24T10:52:35  <pedrosorio> but in pathfinding
2011-10-24T10:52:41  <Craklyn_> It'd be nice to have maps with food appearing more slowly and more space between bases.  The game gets clustered quite quickly on the current maps
2011-10-24T10:52:42  <pedrosorio> oh yeah
2011-10-24T10:52:44  <Guest92487> 
2011-10-24T10:53:07  <Craklyn_> In 1v1, you can control the sparsity of the map by exchanging ant for ant, but in games with more players, it's not as possible

2011-10-24T11:42:46  <Bleda> I have a question about the strategy of exploring, I was hoping to soak up some info :) What do people do in general?
2011-10-24T11:42:54  <Bleda> Move to places furthest from your hills?
2011-10-24T11:43:05  <Bleda> Move to unexplored places?
2011-10-24T11:43:16  <Bleda> Move to places that aren't currently "visible" ?
2011-10-24T11:43:20  <Craklyn_> I have a strategy which I have partially implemented.  When the game starts, I make a map of integers and set them all to -1.
2011-10-24T11:43:21  <avdg1> meh, I'm tired of these lone surviver message when none survived *digs in code*
2011-10-24T11:43:33  <Craklyn_> Each turn that I see a square, I mark the value of that position of the map the turn number.
2011-10-24T11:43:51  <Craklyn_> I then have "explorer" ants who want to increase the sum of all squares on the map
2011-10-24T11:44:18  <Craklyn_> So the longer you haven't seen squares and the larger the difference between the value on the squares and the current turn, the greater the impetus to explore a region
2011-10-24T11:44:42  <Craklyn_> I haven't finished implementing it, so I can't say if it's a good strategy or not, Bleda :P

2011-10-24T11:45:21  <Bleda> That's pretty clever. That's actually what I was struggling with... the strategies I listed above don't really encourage ants to "go back" to places already explored.
2011-10-24T11:45:24  <ruser> yay, my 2nd whiteboard arrive,  this time undamaged, time to get cracking on the code
2011-10-24T11:47:10  <Bleda> I guess you would only designate "explorer" ants after dealing with more pressing stuff (food, enemies, etc.)

2011-10-24T11:47:42  <Craklyn_> I'm not sure.  By late game, the map gets pretty dense with ants, so you really can't explore effectively
2011-10-24T11:48:16  *** Areks <Areks!~Areks@176.14.214.163> has joined #aichallenge
2011-10-24T11:49:10  <Craklyn_> It might be smartest to have the game decide which is more pressing for each ant:  Each ant, should the ant be an explorer, an eater, a warrior, etc?
2011-10-24T11:49:33  <Craklyn_> For example, if you have food nearby, then the engine picks that this ant is an eater and heads toward the food.
2011-10-24T11:49:54  <Craklyn_> If you have no food nearby, and you are adjacent to a region which hasn't been seen in a while, you designate it explorer
2011-10-24T11:50:28  <Craklyn_> If you have food nearby and you're adjacent to a region which hasn't been explored AND there's an enemy ant which will kill you if you move that direction...then you coordinate with another nearby ant and become a warrior party...
2011-10-24T11:51:09  <Craklyn_> Like I said, I didn't implement explorer yet.  I thought I'd take care of how to "see" enemy ants first so my explorers don't suicide
2011-10-24T11:51:37  <Bleda> What would you do at the beginning, since most areas are -1? I guess go to the closest area that is at -1 ?
2011-10-24T11:52:33  <Craklyn_> Right now, my engine considers how much the map's value changes if my ant goes in each direction: n,w,e,s.  If the value change is the same in all four directions, then it adds all four of those directions to a list and chooses randomly.

2011-10-24T11:53:11  <Craklyn_> You *should* make it much more complicated by planning multiple moves in the future and spreading out from other explorer ants (so they dont' both explore the same region)

2011-10-24T11:53:37  <Bleda> Ok. I've been trying to keep randomness out of my bot for now, so it's less difficult to debug, but at some point I'm sure i'll start using it since it's so useful.
2011-10-24T11:54:22  <Craklyn_> Yeah, if you don't want random, then you can just have it prioritize North, east, south, then west.
2011-10-24T11:54:48  <Bleda> Makes sense.

2011-10-24T12:12:07  <Craklyn_> For my "wave search" I make a map of integers of the same dimensions as the actual grid.
2011-10-24T12:12:13  <rog_> the game_logs/*.stream files are what is sent to the bots, or am I wrong?
2011-10-24T12:12:20  <delt0r_> mcstar: propagated info over the graph --ie in a wave.
2011-10-24T12:12:33  <Craklyn_> I mark all the food as having a value of 0.  All the squares adjacent to 0 get  avalue of 1.  And squares adjacent to that a value of 2, etc

2011-10-24T12:13:38  <Craklyn_> This isn't a good search algorithm becaues it results in multiple ants heading toward the same goal.  But it's good because it's very fast.

2011-10-24T12:14:18  <Craklyn_> Okay, I didn't know it was more commonly known as simply a breadth-first search. :P
2011-10-24T12:14:52  <delt0r_> I have only seen the term used in reference to finding geodesics over arbitrary simple closed polygon meshes

2011-10-24T13:31:33  <olexs> rog_: you need to use timers in a smart way... I'm building a timekeeping system for my bot now, that will dynamically adjust the search depths of searches my bot performs, so that most time available is used, but no timeouts wil result
2011-10-24T13:32:08  <pedrosorio> f4hy: your execution time doesn't depend on the number of bots you have?
2011-10-24T13:33:53  <rog_> olexs: yeah, that's sound pretty but not that easy to me :-)
2011-10-24T13:34:06  <olexs> rog_: I didn't say it was easy :)
2011-10-24T13:38:31  <avdg1> hmm, when does the time limit start, after the go message?
2011-10-24T13:38:44  <rog_> olexs: sure! I hope you will manage to get it work :-) Personally, I have a lot to do before thinking of implenting such an idea… but one step after the other, I'm making progress!
2011-10-24T13:41:32  <olexs> rog_: indeed, one step after the other... that's why I'm spending hours debugging what I have now, before I get to coding that...
2011-10-24T13:42:13  <olexs> AI is getting scary when you stop to understand what the hell your bot is doing, and then realize it was actually doing the smart thing
2011-10-24T13:44:20  <Zannick> no, AI gets scary when your ants form the letters "I'M WATCHING YOU"
2011-10-24T13:44:45  <UncleVasya> And it become play worse when you fix some bugs...

2011-10-24T14:38:50  <olexs> it was changed because old colors were not colorblind-friendly... I think now it's only friendly to colorblind people, if to any at all

2011-10-24T14:40:34  <cirno_the_greate> well, in general colors fine, but black color very bad
2011-10-24T14:40:44  <olexs> black on brown is very bad
2011-10-24T14:41:04  <olexs> you can turn on the fog of war for your bot (buttons on the left), it helps a bit
2011-10-24T14:41:12  <olexs> but not much
2011-10-24T14:41:23  <amstan> pedrosorio: it's in the starter packages, they'll contain info about when they were packaged, when was the last change and commit message
2011-10-24T14:41:30  <cirno_the_greate> olexs: yep, i'm doing it very often, so repeating colors could be fine for me. May be
2011-10-24T14:42:19  <olexs> cirno_the_greate: I'm doing my testing and debugging on the TCP servers, at least ants.fluxid.pl seems to have better colors.

2011-10-24T14:43:25  <olexs> cirno_the_greate: maybe. but also because they don't highlight your player in black

2011-10-24T14:44:29  <cirno_the_greate> olexs: my bot atm only gathers food
2011-10-24T14:44:34  <cirno_the_greate> so i'm concerned with it :)
2011-10-24T14:44:52  <cirno_the_greate> sometimes accidently stepping on enemy hills :P
2011-10-24T14:44:57  <tampe125> just a question: how do you manage path? i mean, do you calculate everything every turn or you create a path and then execute orders until the ant reaches the target?
2011-10-24T14:44:59  <olexs> tampe125: pretty simple for me. have a binary map of "visible" data for every square, that's reset to false after every turn. at beginning of every turn, do a multi-seed breadth first search around my ants with radius = viewradius and mark everything as visible. done.
2011-10-24T14:45:49  <tampe125> olexs: great, this is very like what i'm doing :)

2011-10-24T14:46:55  <olexs> tampe125: you need to watch out that the search is fast, since it's done every turn, you can't really allow to waste much time on it
2011-10-24T14:47:28  <olexs> Seth: using playgame.py with -E parameter to log stderr, and outputting a lot of logging information into it
2011-10-24T14:47:59  <olexs> then cross-reference the game replay with the log data, I can mostly figure out if anything's wrong

2011-10-24T14:50:15  <olexs> tampe125: and to your question about paths. for me, I'm calculating all I need every turn. but then, I never calculate full paths but only the first element. my bot only saves little information between turns

2011-10-24T14:51:16  <cirno_the_greate> tampe125: you need to optimize it
2011-10-24T14:51:20  <olexs> tampe125: no A*, breadth-first, which in theory should be even heavier

2011-10-24T14:51:27  <cirno_the_greate> for example if you have big swarm approaching to enemy base
2011-10-24T14:51:31  <Seth> tampe125: Don't run it every turn, only run it once for each target point
2011-10-24T14:51:33  <olexs> but in practice it's more than fast enough for me
2011-10-24T14:51:44  <Seth> tampe125: then run it again when you reach the target
2011-10-24T14:51:46  <cirno_the_greate> you can calculate it for key ants
2011-10-24T14:52:11  <olexs> but then I have only very few situations where I know points A and B and need a path
2011-10-24T14:52:19  <tampe125> Seth: in that way you have to save the path
2011-10-24T14:52:22  <Seth> cirno_the_greate: Yeah, for the colorblind you would want to change the saturation to 100% and the lightness
2011-10-24T14:52:28  <cirno_the_greate> i'm thinking, is it possible to create AI as stateless machine
2011-10-24T14:52:32  <olexs> mostly it is like I have a point A and need a certain entity found and then directed to A, or A directed to it
2011-10-24T14:52:36  <cirno_the_greate> without state between turns
2011-10-24T14:52:39  <tampe125> Seth: (forgot a question mark) :P
2011-10-24T14:52:44  <olexs> which is done in one search
2011-10-24T14:52:46  <McLeopold> cirno_the_greate: somewhat, you basically have 2 sides of the color wheel, then must vary for lightness
2011-10-24T14:53:10  <cirno_the_greate> Seth: yeah, i'll play with colors then on my ride to home
2011-10-24T14:53:13  <Seth> tampe125: I'm saving mine in a set of points.  Then the bot goes through those points
2011-10-24T14:53:38  <Seth> cirno_the_greate: let me know if you get it working.  I tried to change it yesterday night and didn't see any change at all
2011-10-24T14:53:43  <olexs> for example, I search starting with all food I see, looking for my ants. BFS finds the closest ant to every food item and sends them away in one pass
2011-10-24T14:54:08  <cirno_the_greate> olexs: what you do when timelimit is close?
2011-10-24T14:54:23  <f4hy> pedrosorio: correct, my execution time does not depend on the number of bots i have.... it depends on the number of food I see ;-)
2011-10-24T14:54:29  <tampe125> Seth: ok, last question :P is there a way to have an ID for an ant? how do you apply the saved path to the correct ant?
2011-10-24T14:54:29  <cirno_the_greate> Seth: at least we need something bright for active player

2011-10-24T14:54:52  <olexs> cirno_the_greate: the BFS is so fast I never encountered timeouts through it. there is another, much heavier calculation (battle simulation tree search) that can cause timeouts, but I have different means of keeping time there
2011-10-24T14:54:53  <tampe125> olexs: ok, but what if you have some water to get around?
2011-10-24T14:55:07  <McLeopold> cirno_the_greate: the problem with bright for current player is the graph is then hard to see.  I wanted white to start with, but it doesn't work.
2011-10-24T14:55:10  <olexs> tampe125: BFS gets around water just fine, it will not search water squares
2011-10-24T14:55:34  <McLeopold> If we could make their graph black, that would be awesome
2011-10-24T14:55:39  <olexs> (in that particular case it won't, when it's doing vision check it will)
2011-10-24T14:55:40  <ikaros> i use bfs for targets like food and hills too
2011-10-24T14:55:57  <ikaros> the time wasn't a problem so far.. even with 300 ants
2011-10-24T14:56:13  <Seth> tampe125: I have an object for each ant, though you could just try to keep track of what is moving where
2011-10-24T14:56:32  <tampe125> Seth: ok thank you very much!
2011-10-24T14:56:35  <olexs> ikaros: yep, if you use one well-coded BFS the number of seeds is pretty irrelevant, as long as you run the search once and not once for every ant or so :)

2011-10-24T14:58:28  <Seth> sorry I left, what was the last question about keeping track of state
2011-10-24T14:58:31  <olexs> McLeopold: why not make the graph background same as land tile background? then you'll have same contrast on the map and in the graph
2011-10-24T14:58:32  <ajf> although, it would pick that food up anyway
2011-10-24T14:58:37  <ajf> so it's kinda pointless
2011-10-24T14:59:14  <olexs> McLeopold: having white graph and dark map complicates choosing good colors a lot
2011-10-24T14:59:22  <pedrosorio> f4hy: but that means apart from searching for food, you move randomly...
2011-10-24T15:00:35  <Savaron_> Seth: I asked, how you keep track of the different ants
2011-10-24T15:00:54  <Savaron_> do you check their supposed location and remove it if there is none?
2011-10-24T15:01:01  <pedrosorio> Savaron_: the sample bots are creating the ants vector with the location of each ant, each turn, but you don't need to do that
2011-10-24T15:01:04  <cirno_the_greate> McLeopold: ah, that graph
2011-10-24T15:01:16  <cirno_the_greate> olexs: good idea
2011-10-24T15:01:28  <Savaron_> sure, but those ants are removed each turn
2011-10-24T15:01:56  <Savaron_> before I start I would like to know the directin I'm going ;)
2011-10-24T15:02:14  <Seth> Savaron_: What you could do is keep track of where your ants should move, and if you have an ant in that spot next turn, then it is the same ant
2011-10-24T15:02:29  <f4hy> pedrosorio: no, ants move to areas of high and low potential. they only look at the 4 squares around them, so yes there is some sacling in number of ants, but mostly I set up a smart grid and dumb ants

2011-10-24T15:32:02  <Gadela> how does the engine work i mean how the bots communicate with the world? the seem isolated console applications

2011-10-24T15:37:22  <rmmh> did you read the problem description?
2011-10-24T15:37:31  <rmmh> it's turn based. the server asks each bot for their moves
2011-10-24T15:37:34  <olexs> game server gives the ants all information they need every turn
2011-10-24T15:37:46  <olexs> and waits for them to tell it their moves
2011-10-24T15:38:03  <Gadela> aham maybe i accidentally skipped that section
2011-10-24T15:38:27  <ikaros> ajf, perhaps you store your ants in a function in a list or an array. then you make different order loops and because your positions are updated bad things happen
2011-10-24T15:38:54  <ikaros> because the lists still contain the old positions
2011-10-24T15:39:16  <ikaros> but your hashtable or whatever you use to store them is already updated

2011-10-24T16:20:58  <f4hy> An interesting variant of the gmae would be everyone has a queen ant instead of hills, and the new ants spawn on the queen, which can move just like the ants.
2011-10-24T16:21:19  <McLeopold> so the queen poops out new ants?

2011-10-24T16:29:15  <f4hy> have a goalkeeper
2011-10-24T16:29:33  <olexs> hm... what's a good Java data structure for the A* open list? it needs to be some sort of a map sorted by values...
2011-10-24T16:30:32  <kakashi_> olexs, hash?
2011-10-24T16:30:39  <agentsnakezero> hash or tree olexs
2011-10-24T16:30:57  <olexs> hashmap is first that comes to mind, but it's not natively sorted
2011-10-24T16:31:37  <olexs> hashmap with a tree index over values would work, but that's not that easy to implement :)
2011-10-24T16:32:18  <agentsnakezero> you could...make a graph class
2011-10-24T16:33:22  <agentsnakezero> that way you have a list of parents and kids and then the edges themself have the weights
2011-10-24T16:33:32  <olexs> a graph I already have
2011-10-24T16:33:47  <olexs> I need something to store the list of the nodes that are to be expanded
2011-10-24T16:34:11  <agentsnakezero> arraylist and the sort method
2011-10-24T16:34:13  <ajf> my bot no longer cares about running into its own ants
2011-10-24T16:34:14  <olexs> those nodes each have a f() value, and I need to efficiently access the one that has this value lowest
2011-10-24T16:34:24  <olexs> agentsnakezero: would work, but slow
2011-10-24T16:34:46  <agentsnakezero> other than arraylist, a binary tree
2011-10-24T16:35:06  <pedrosorio> tassadar_: lvl55, lvl60, are you talking about skill (MMORPG much? :P)
2011-10-24T16:36:11  <olexs> agentsnakezero: but ideally, it needs to be a map, since the node objects themselves do not include the f() value :) thus a map with a binary tree index... hmph

2011-10-24T16:37:45  <olexs> I could, but that node object is used in many other places and including the data in it would be hacking indeed :)
2011-10-24T16:38:25  <agentsnakezero> yep, more problems than they are worth
2011-10-24T16:39:01  <olexs> thing is, this needs to be next-to-perfect performance-wise, since it will be used just about everywhere in the bot, replacing BFS in many many use cases
2011-10-24T16:39:50  <agentsnakezero> that will be painful to optimise
2011-10-24T16:40:12  <olexs> the BFS is already optimized to all ends and it's blisteringly fast, but A* is in a different league when you have a heuristic... and it so happens in many cases I do

2011-10-24T16:44:04  <pedrosorio> olexs: I was thinking that the typical A* paths we will be computing are quite short, so probably asymptotic behavior is not that crucial

2011-10-24T16:47:29  <Kusand> Rule question: do the rules prevent codesharing of any kind, or simply prevent someone from having multiple accounts? A friend and I were interested in collaborating on implementing an A* algo but don't want to break any rules.
2011-10-24T16:49:15  <agentsnakezero> I am not a mod/admin but from what I can tell as long as its only one account per person/group it is fine

2011-10-24T16:50:43  <Kusand> that's the thing, i think we'd both like to try separate overall implementations from different accounts, but feel like we're nuts to code up separate A* algorithms.
2011-10-24T16:50:51  <pedrosorio> I think you can even enter and compete as a group with one account
2011-10-24T16:51:02  <Kusand> maybe i'll just post in the forums, i thought i might have a shot at catching a mod here
2011-10-24T16:51:03  <pedrosorio> oh
2011-10-24T16:51:10  <ajf> the frustration you feel when you realise you were looking at the wrong bot when testing

2011-10-24T16:51:18  <Kusand> yeah, that's the thing. don't want to break any rules, though.
2011-10-24T16:51:25  <olexs> Kusand: I think implementing an algorithm together is not against the rules. Many people will be using similar implementations found on the web

2011-10-24T17:28:46  <master_ninja> thanks rmmh

2011-10-24T17:29:28  <thestinger> the README.txt says the server should use the Makefile if you provide one but it's not working for me :\
2011-10-24T17:29:56  <rmmh> the README.txt is lying then
2011-10-24T17:30:42  <pedrosorio> master_ninja: why does it matter?

2011-10-24T17:32:30  <ajf> yeah
2011-10-24T17:32:42  <ajf> they just do gcc *.c -o MyBot

2011-10-24T17:37:23  <rmmh> pretty sure -O3 implies -funroll-loops
2011-10-24T17:37:43  <thestinger> no, only if you use pgo
2011-10-24T17:37:49  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html
2011-10-24T17:37:57  <rmmh> ah
2011-10-24T17:38:21  <thestinger> it actually makes code slower most of the time in my experience if you aren't using it through PGO
2011-10-24T17:38:48  <thestinger> (that's why it's not in -O3)
2011-10-24T17:39:44  <master_ninja> heh, and I thought it was faster

2011-10-24T17:41:30  <AndrewBC> at first I was :( because there were no optimization flags for their Go compiling
2011-10-24T17:41:50  <AndrewBC> but then I looked up what flags there are and there is only one flag related to optimization and it's to turn them off

2011-10-24T17:42:07  <rmmh> I guess you could try to get them to use gccgo

2011-10-24T17:42:28  <AndrewBC> it sometimes can't even tell a variable is used or not because it's split into separate blocks
2011-10-24T17:42:33  <AndrewBC> nah I like 6g better
2011-10-24T17:43:32  <AndrewBC> it's been more feature complete over the past while
2011-10-24T17:43:47  <AndrewBC> though apparently they're working on making gccgo catch up for 1.0
2011-10-24T17:44:49  <AndrewBC> I wish they would just drop that and dual release *g et al under GPL or something. I've had bad experiences with languages with multiple suites of compilers (I'm looking at you, D)
2011-10-24T17:45:08  <AndrewBC> It's just grumbling until they muck it up, though
2011-10-24T17:46:03  <thestinger> the *g compilers are already open-source (all the go stuff is under a BSD/MIT-like license)
2011-10-24T17:46:27  <AndrewBC> would you believe me if I told you that that's too open source for GPL users to use? :P
2011-10-24T17:46:44  <thestinger> well, I can understand why people wouldn't want to contribute code to them

2011-10-24T17:51:10  <ajf> here's a suggestion
2011-10-24T17:51:12  <ajf> for python
2011-10-24T17:51:26  <ajf> "compile" it by making python produce .pyc/.pyo files
2011-10-24T17:51:29  <ikaros> in the replay viewer
2011-10-24T17:51:43  <ajf> hence, it will show up as failed compile if it contains syntax errors
2011-10-24T17:52:04  <ajf> less CPU wasted too as it has faster startup plus fails before testing

2011-10-24T18:53:45  <McLeopold> janzert: I was going with the dirt color, so that I had fewer hues that were off limits for ant colors

2011-10-24T18:54:55  <Fluxid> AndrewBC: tried three ways, the third one worked finally 100% perfect. and tries harder not to block hive

2011-10-24T18:55:42  <McLeopold> I really think that water, dirt and food should be very neutral and blend into the background.  I only really care about watching ants move around, and sometimes about a path or food gathering.

2011-10-24T19:51:52  <avdg1> its just bad uhh good luck
2011-10-24T19:52:08  <Alexer> thestinger, probably. i tracked one of those for a live game, looked at the "turn N moves ignored" "o COORDINATE DIRECTION" and looked at the replay at that turn -> there was nothing there
2011-10-24T19:53:20  <thestinger> ah, I fixed it
2011-10-24T19:53:35  <thestinger> you have to check if squares next to you contain food
2011-10-24T19:54:09  <thestinger> I need to do it because of the way I avoid collisions - if a location contains an ant but it is moving somewhere, you can move there
2011-10-24T19:54:18  <thestinger> so the move blocked stuff was also causing collisions xD
2011-10-24T19:54:35  <Alexer> avdg1, i'd love a version control system that had a two level-versioning >:P i mean, it'd let you change stuff, but it would keep versions of those changes. in theory anyway. in practice it probably wouldn't be that nice, if i actually got to try it..

2011-10-24T20:05:27  <avdg1> it should be available in squared format

2011-10-24T20:05:39  <Cowbandit> wait so
2011-10-24T20:05:44  <Cowbandit> does that mean i should write a method that tests

2011-10-24T20:06:03  <avdg1> yeah
2011-10-24T20:06:07  <avdg1> probably
2011-10-24T20:06:10  <Cowbandit> or is there one that is given
2011-10-24T20:06:10  <Cowbandit> o ok
2011-10-24T20:06:15  <Cowbandit> because i was under the impression by the tutorial

2011-10-24T20:22:58  <cyphase> plenty of time hopefully for 2000 at least somewhat decent bots :P

2011-10-24T20:50:04  <thestinger> I have a feeling the good python bots are using libraries like numpy, because even the bot you get from just following the tutorial uses a lot of time
2011-10-24T20:50:34  <thestinger> are the available libs documented anywhere?
2011-10-24T20:50:34  <SharkMonkey> I really don't think its necessary
2011-10-24T20:50:45  <Fluxid> duh, i don't know scipy/numpy much, so i won't bother now
2011-10-24T20:51:01  <cyphase> thestinger, yea, but the tutorial bot is reeally inefficient. looping however many times through a possibly 14000+ list
2011-10-24T20:51:10  <cyphase> item list*
2011-10-24T20:51:11  <Fluxid> but if there was pypy, i'd just port my code to py2
2011-10-24T20:51:34  <Fluxid> cyphase: this is why i started from scratch
2011-10-24T20:51:42  <cyphase> i haven't used numpy before, but it sounds like it'd be good, at least for the matrix object

2011-10-24T20:55:06  <a1k0n> yeah, there was an icfp contest like that once
2011-10-24T20:55:15  <Craklyn> It's be pretty hard to have interesting emergent behavior if they weren't given a way to communicate I think.
2011-10-24T20:55:15  <SharkMonkey> Fluxid, Well one program. That applied to each of your ants.
2011-10-24T20:55:29  <Craklyn> Unless they had a lot more vision than is common currently
2011-10-24T20:55:31  <a1k0n> Craklyn: totally untrue
2011-10-24T20:55:49  <cyphase> oh, the contest. someone was doing something like that using Go.. AndrewBC i think
2011-10-24T20:55:52  <a1k0n> as long as they can see each other
2011-10-24T20:55:53  <Craklyn> No, it's true.  That's what I think.
2011-10-24T20:55:57  <Fluxid> SharkMonkey: program instances
2011-10-24T20:56:01  <a1k0n> heh, ok.
2011-10-24T20:56:08  <SharkMonkey> Fluxid, yeah

2011-10-24T20:56:09  <a1k0n> i disagree!
2011-10-24T20:56:49  <Craklyn> Good sir, I think now we can have a discussion.  Why do you think it would be possible to have interesting emergent behavior with the current typical sight ranges we see if ants could not communicate any information except by their position and movement?
2011-10-24T20:56:53  <Fluxid> Craklyn: i think it could work
2011-10-24T20:57:29  <cyphase> have them shout orders down the line
2011-10-24T20:57:38  <cyphase> or get closer if they have to keep them secret
2011-10-24T20:57:41  <Craklyn> That's communicating..
2011-10-24T20:57:48  <cyphase> i know
2011-10-24T20:57:49  <a1k0n> because they can predict one another's next move.  i think interesting brhavior would emerge
2011-10-24T20:58:03  <Fluxid> Craklyn: what is missing is map discovery. then you try just to keep as much map visible as possible. when you see everything, you can start to move ants closes to hills. done
2011-10-24T20:58:03  <Craklyn> They can predict one another's move only if they can see what the next ant sees
2011-10-24T20:58:28  <a1k0n> right.  i guess youre right about the vision complicates things
2011-10-24T20:58:38  <a1k0n> also im holding an infant and so can't really type
2011-10-24T20:58:49  <Fluxid> :)
2011-10-24T20:59:00  <Craklyn> So you're saying that the ants can communicate what they see to one another, Fluxid?
2011-10-24T20:59:22  <Craklyn> I'm not sure if I understood your comment, Fluxid :(
2011-10-24T20:59:24  <a1k0n> it also depends on what is interesting
2011-10-24T20:59:26  <krishna> I think bees communicate through movement somehow. You might also go a long way with some stochastic decision based on ants near you.
2011-10-24T20:59:37  <krishna> Number of ants near you I mean
2011-10-24T20:59:42  <a1k0n> but i think, for instance, you could do fairly smart ad-hoc battle groups with the current vision as-is
2011-10-24T20:59:44  <Fluxid> Craklyn: what are we discussing now? program instance per ant or not having any state stored between turns?
2011-10-24T20:59:49  <Craklyn> If you have lots of time, you could communicate by dancing, yeah.  It would burn a lot of your turns, imo
2011-10-24T20:59:53  <Fluxid> i'm talking about latter
2011-10-24T21:00:08  <burny> I'm going to make my ants try to communicate to other ants with movement, and try to negotiate truces
2011-10-24T21:00:20  <cyphase> not having any state is interesting, but not realistic
2011-10-24T21:00:27  <Craklyn> I was imagining that the you had a single instance of the program running for each ant and each ant could see only its own vision.
2011-10-24T21:00:36  <a1k0n> i think in the ICFP contest with ants where each ant ran the same program, you could leave trails
2011-10-24T21:00:39  <Fluxid> in former case i agree it is really hard with no way to communicate
2011-10-24T21:00:53  <krishna> burny: Hah. My ants will accept your truce. (then secretly betray you!)
2011-10-24T21:02:45  <Craklyn> If the ants could share vision, then you could have all the ants act in pseudocordination.  Have each instance of the program calculate what EVERY ant on the board will do.  Then just order the one ant it controls.
2011-10-24T21:04:33  <a1k0n> ok i will concede your point.  you need either more vision or trails (communication of some sort)
2011-10-24T21:05:28  <a1k0n> but maybe if your ants march closer together it could be interesting.
2011-10-24T21:05:36  <burny> er, I'm getting confused.. each ant has to make a descision on its own, without any historical info, or info from other ants?
2011-10-24T21:05:43  <a1k0n> (but inefficiently exploring in the process)
2011-10-24T21:07:38  <paulwal> one process per ant, and each process can output "communicate xxx" and all ants within a certain distance will receive "communication received xxx"
2011-10-24T21:08:03  <AndrewBC> no parallelism is allowed
2011-10-24T21:08:07  <paulwal> the amount of information communicated per turn could be limited to, say 4 bits
2011-10-24T21:08:23  <Craklyn> Are you proposing a new hypothetical paulwal? :P
2011-10-24T21:08:25  <SharkMonkey> AndrewBC, We're playing hypothetical game
2011-10-24T21:08:28  <burny> zero persistant data then?
2011-10-24T21:08:32  <AndrewBC> oh, me
2011-10-24T21:08:32  <AndrewBC> h
2011-10-24T21:08:34  <paulwal> i mean for the hypothetical contest being discussed
2011-10-24T21:08:40  <burny> ahhhh
2011-10-24T21:08:54  <SharkMonkey> AndrewBC, No centralized state. Maybe ants with their own state.
2011-10-24T21:08:56  <burny> the hard part about that then..
2011-10-24T21:08:57  <Craklyn> burny: My understanding of the previous hypothetical discussion is different than what you just said... :P
2011-10-24T21:09:18  <Craklyn> Ooops, that was paulwal:  Not burny :P
2011-10-24T21:09:23  <burny> would be having no persistent data
2011-10-24T21:10:07  <paulwal> each process would persist between turns, just not between games
2011-10-24T21:10:30  <burny> I would say more, that each ant can have it's own copy of persistent data, and when it returns to the hive: it's data is given to every ant that leaves the ant from then on

2011-10-24T21:12:15  <Fluxid> as link in the middle of game spec
2011-10-24T21:12:33  <burny> then each ant will tend to just gather data, and keep track of it's path home.. and the hive will do all major path finding calculations
2011-10-24T21:12:44  <paulwal> the site could be better organized and written

2011-10-24T21:22:54  <burny> craklyn... the idea I have behind such a server.. is that it lets people who are just starting, test a sub-set of their bot logic
2011-10-24T21:24:16  <burny> eg. they can test path finding, without being tripped up on all sorts of other possibilities(eg. not seeing parts of the map, logic deciding that a long discovered path, is better than a short potential path, etc.
2011-10-24T21:24:46  <Craklyn> Sure, that makes sense.  It doesn't affect my response though :P
2011-10-24T21:25:03  <burny> obviously, people can test anything and everything all by themselves
2011-10-24T21:25:40  <burny> but if the organizers had a few servers with slightly modified rules, it would help out people who are weaker, and/or don't have a lot of time to put into it
2011-10-24T21:26:26  <Craklyn> I'm saying - why don't you make one of these servers? :)
2011-10-24T21:26:42  <burny> not worth the time
2011-10-24T21:27:00  <Craklyn> The implication of what I'm saying is: (Then why is it worth someone else's time?)
2011-10-24T21:27:17  <burny> because everyone could use it
2011-10-24T21:27:27  <Craklyn> You could make it and share it just the same..

2011-10-24T22:03:31  <Alexer> Islacrusez, when you learn your second language, you already know how to program, you just need to learn the [syntax of the] new language
2011-10-24T22:03:37  <burny> if you don't know any language yet, and want to learn how to program: it's easy for the language itself to be a considerable obstacle

2011-10-24T22:10:15  <mleise> ah functional languages make for nice code, but I just can't leave the close-to-the-metal nature of a systems language and the good old syntax
2011-10-24T22:10:31  <jmcarthur> python has list comprehensions too
2011-10-24T22:10:41  <jmcarthur> (stole the idea from haskell, they did)
2011-10-24T22:10:51  <thestinger> imo, you end up getting used to the syntax of whatever language you're using most and you hate everything else
2011-10-24T22:10:55  <mleise> and haskell stole it from? ...
2011-10-24T22:11:01  <Alexer> Islacrusez, well, it makes i go from a to b-1

2011-10-24T22:13:15  <Alexer> Islacrusez, and on the first iteration with n = 2, so the second level is range(2, 2), so it doesn't do anything

2011-10-24T22:13:42  <mleise> When I started programming functional languages didn't even exist in most people's heads. It was just about the time when Python started to become famous among insiders.

2011-10-24T22:20:33  <jmcarthur> i admit it did work out well. it means that the difference of the numbers is the length of the list it represents

2011-10-24T22:21:33  <question_> http://aichallenge.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=1589
2011-10-24T22:21:43  <Craklyn> If you upload unmodified C++ code in the same way, does it work question_?
2011-10-24T22:21:44  <question_> that is the link to my post, i have made both changes, but it still crashes
2011-10-24T22:22:00  <jmcarthur> Alexer: sure, but n normally represents the length, not the upper bound
2011-10-24T22:22:16  <jmcarthur> Alexer: in this range notation, however, it means the upper bound (since the lower bound isn't necessarily 0)
2011-10-24T22:22:19  <guest_____> Is the default Java starter bot broken? It crashes on start when I try to run it.
2011-10-24T22:22:24  <jmcarthur> or, rather, one past the upper bound
2011-10-24T22:22:28  <question_> it worked when i uploaded the first starter package
2011-10-24T22:23:10  <Islacrusez> I gave up on the java package earlier; it was broken for me for some reason
2011-10-24T22:23:37  <jmcarthur> that range function would make more sense to me if the second parameter was actually the length instead of something representing the upper bound, i think
2011-10-24T22:23:44  <Alexer> jmcarthur, mmm, why one past upper bound? if length = n, indexes go from 0 to n-1, so n is the upper bound? (unless we just use different terminology :P)
2011-10-24T22:24:09  <guest_____> I get a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException whenever I run it.
2011-10-24T22:24:18  <jmcarthur> Alexer: the typical for loop starts at zero and goes up to some length
2011-10-24T22:24:43  <Craklyn> guest______ I got that too when I ran java in linux.  If you use windows, it works correctly (but you're using windows...)

2011-10-24T22:25:53  <Craklyn> Question: You have a syntax error at runtime but not at compile-time?
2011-10-24T22:26:41  <Alexer> jmcarthur, and that's what it does; range(0, 10) == [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
2011-10-24T22:27:00  <Alexer> which is what you get with for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) too
2011-10-24T22:27:21  <question_> i can run the code on the play_one_game.cmd but running test_bot.cmd it says crash turn 0 bot 1 and same when I upload to the server
2011-10-24T22:27:22  <jmcarthur> Alexer: but my point is that when the start is not 0, the second parameter is no longer length and instead becomes this strange one-past-the-end thing
2011-10-24T22:27:57  <jmcarthur> Alexer: what i'm trying to get at is that range looks more like the semantics of a for loop than the semantics of an interval

2011-10-24T22:30:04  <Alexer> jmcarthur, that just means you're iterating a list of length N starting from some other index than 0 ;)
2011-10-24T22:30:10  <Alexer> usually
2011-10-24T22:30:32  <jmcarthur> Alexer: but the second parameter isn't length

2011-10-24T22:32:12  <Alexer> jmcarthur, that works well for most use-cases of range(). list-slicing uses the same notation, more often it's there that you need lengths
2011-10-24T22:32:13  <paulwal>  guest_____, someone had that problem with the java starter bot last night. mcstar figured out why. I think it has something to do with the test scripts not expecting a .jar filetype
2011-10-24T22:32:53  <Alexer> i don't think i've ever written "range(a, a + n)"
2011-10-24T22:33:17  <Alexer> but "some_list[a:a+n]" comes up quite often
2011-10-24T22:33:34  <jmcarthur> i assume by list you mean array?
2011-10-24T22:33:56  <jmcarthur> slicing in haskell is usually specified by offset and length
2011-10-24T22:34:00  <Craklyn> paulwal:  The .jar filetype works for me in windows.  It doesn't work for me in cygwin or linux :(
2011-10-24T22:34:07  <Alexer> jmcarthur, what's the difference here? :P
2011-10-24T22:34:29  <jmcarthur> slice a n  instead of  slice a (a+n)
2011-10-24T22:34:46  <Alexer> jmcarthur, no, i meant between list and array?
2011-10-24T22:34:58  <jmcarthur> arrays are packed in memory
2011-10-24T22:35:07  <jmcarthur> lists are just linked lists
2011-10-24T22:35:32  <Alexer> yeah, array in that terminology
2011-10-24T22:35:33  <jmcarthur> sometimes people use "list" to mean some higher level idea of "sequence"
2011-10-24T22:35:44  <question_> wow that was a really annoying process
2011-10-24T22:35:45  <jmcarthur> so it's ambiguous, which is why i was asking
2011-10-24T22:35:52  <question_> now to wait and see if the server accepts it
2011-10-24T22:35:55  <jmcarthur> since slicing doesn't make a lot of sense with linked lists

2011-10-24T22:36:43  <Alexer> jmcarthur, so if you want to iterate from some index to the end of a list, you do something like "enumFromN a b-a"?

2011-10-24T22:36:52  <jmcarthur> *surprises
2011-10-24T22:36:57  <thestinger> well, you can use slicing to change the original list too

2011-10-24T22:37:51  <otzi> you can make efficient haskell code, but it's very hard to write. At least I think so.
2011-10-24T22:38:04  <thestinger> you can do some_list[2:3] = [3,4]
2011-10-24T22:38:17  <thestinger> and it changes some_list

2011-10-24T22:44:38  <jmcarthur> Alexer: [0..n-1]?

2011-10-24T22:54:28  <jmcarthur> i'm going to use the range that i consider more sane ([0..n] instead of [0..n-1])
2011-10-24T22:54:50  <Alexer> jmcarthur, where would you use [0..n]?
2011-10-24T22:55:06  <jmcarthur> when i know i need the numbers in the range 0 to n...
2011-10-24T22:55:23  <jmcarthur> i pretty much never need [0..n-1], at least in haskell
2011-10-24T22:55:32  <Alexer> jmcarthur, but can you give an example?
2011-10-24T22:55:58  <jmcarthur> it's likely to be contrived
2011-10-24T22:56:22  <jmcarthur> can you name the problem you are solving with this under-the-diagonal thing?
2011-10-24T22:56:30  <Alexer> because as for me, i don't remember using range(n+1) in python very often

2011-10-24T22:57:43  <Alexer> jmcarthur, it was the first thing that came to mind for using range(i, n), but i accidentally ended up using range(i) instead :P
2011-10-24T23:00:22  <Alexer> but range is generally used when you need to iterate a list with indexes instead of values in python for some reason
2011-10-24T23:00:30  <jmcarthur> how about a more motivated example?

2011-10-24T23:01:59  <jmcarthur> the cases i'm talking about are not really about indexing
2011-10-24T23:02:11  <jmcarthur> you don't do much indexing in haskell, really
2011-10-24T23:02:48  <Alexer> jmcarthur, well, range() is mostly about indexing in python
2011-10-24T23:03:11  <jmcarthur> all the more reason i'm confused that the second parameter is a bound instead of a length ;)
2011-10-24T23:03:14  <thestinger> you can do 'for index, value in enumerate(iterator)' though
2011-10-24T23:04:08  <Alexer> jmcarthur, well, if it was a length, you'd need to do (i, n - i) instead of (i, n) :P

2011-10-24T23:04:34  <jmcarthur> you usually know the length of an array or subarray, not its upper bound
2011-10-24T23:05:20  <guest_____> When I try to run the playgame tool in cygwin it tries to launch links to show the replay, which doesn't work... anyone know how to make it launch in firefox instead?
2011-10-24T23:07:18  <Alexer> jmcarthur, well, n is the length of the array and n-i is the length of the subarray?
2011-10-24T23:07:21  <thestinger> can you launch windows processes from cygwin? you can probably "export BROWSER=path_to_firefox"
2011-10-24T23:08:07  <Alexer> jmcarthur, i guess i'd have to actually know haskell to understand how you think when programming with it :P
2011-10-24T23:08:10  <jmcarthur> Alexer: for example, say i have an array with 20 elements and i want to slice it into two equally sized arrays. with my style of slicing, it would be more like   slice 0 10 *** slice 10 10,  but with yours it must be  range 0 10 ** range 10 20
2011-10-24T23:08:59  <jmcarthur> Alexer: that is, you have to come up with both the lower bound *and* the upper bound for successive slices, whereas with the length version you only need to come up with the lower bounds
2011-10-24T23:09:12  <guest_____> thestinger: I'm actually not sure how links is even considered my default browser, as firefox is in windows... and none of my env variables have links named

2011-10-24T23:13:06  <Alexer> jmcarthur, true, if i'm chunking a list, i'd have to write something like [some_list[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(some_list), 2)]

2011-10-24T23:19:30  <jmcarthur> generally you would think in terms of maps and folds and stuff, not indices
2011-10-24T23:19:33  <Alexer> i think my point was mostly "range() works well in python for what it's used for" :P
2011-10-24T23:19:50  <jmcarthur> there are cases where you would slice arrays in haskell though

2011-10-24T23:22:11  <thestinger> anyway, haskell will beat python at anything when it comes to speed :P

2011-10-24T23:29:47  <Alexer> jmcarthur, append == push

2011-10-24T23:30:08  <jmcarthur> Alexer: well, append sticks two arrays together. it does more than push
2011-10-24T23:30:25  <Alexer> jmcarthur, then "extend" is what you're thinking about
2011-10-24T23:30:25  <bmh> jmcarthur: feel like publishing your parser?
2011-10-24T23:30:29  <jmcarthur> Alexer: using append, you can push 1 item or n items with the same amortized complexity
2011-10-24T23:30:44  <bmh> (or pointing me to the fixed haskell starter)
2011-10-24T23:30:55  <jmcarthur> bmh: yeah i might do that in the next couple days once i'm reasonable certain that it's worth publishing
2011-10-24T23:30:59  <jmcarthur> *reasonably
2011-10-24T23:31:06  <jmcarthur> not sure where the fixed starter is
2011-10-24T23:31:27  <jmcarthur> bmh: if you check reddit.com/r/haskell, there should be a relevant looking comment thread. i think there is a link there
2011-10-24T23:31:28  <Alexer> jmcarthur, in python lists, append adds one item to the end and extend adds all of the items of another iterable at the end
2011-10-24T23:31:53  <jmcarthur> Alexer: oh, but extend take O(k)...
2011-10-24T23:32:08  <jmcarthur> bah makes sense
2011-10-24T23:32:14  <jmcarthur> ignore my confusion. it was confused
2011-10-24T23:32:40  <Alexer> jmcarthur, i do that confusion thing a lot too ;)
2011-10-24T23:32:50  <bmh> jmcarthur: found it
2011-10-24T23:33:08  <jmcarthur> Alexer: does python have a sequence type with O(log n) insert that still has O(1) append?
2011-10-24T23:33:21  <Alexer> or actually, ditch the "too", i don't know if you do it a lot :D
2011-10-24T23:34:37  <jmcarthur> or, rather, O(log n) slice
2011-10-24T23:35:03  <jmcarthur> that with O(1) append and O(log n) extend can give you O(log n) insert anyway
2011-10-24T23:35:20  <burny> one of my co-workers told me that slice was like memset
2011-10-24T23:35:32  <jmcarthur> like it how?
2011-10-24T23:35:32  <burny> cause the only thing he uses slice for, is to empty lists
2011-10-24T23:35:36  <Alexer> jmcarthur, python deque is a linked list
2011-10-24T23:36:00  <jmcarthur> doubly linked, i'm guessing?
2011-10-24T23:36:00  <Alexer> burny :D
2011-10-24T23:36:06  <Alexer> jmcarthur, ah, yeah
2011-10-24T23:36:24  <jmcarthur> insertion is still going to be O(n) for that though, unless you already have a cursor inside
2011-10-24T23:38:42  <jmcarthur> doubly linked lists in haskell are kind of crippled unless you make them mutable
2011-10-24T23:39:03  <jmcarthur> since you pretty much can't do anything with an immutable doubly linked list without copying the whole thing for every change
2011-10-24T23:39:56  <Alexer> jmcarthur, ah, true, i don't have to think about list implementation speed that often :P
2011-10-24T23:40:11  <Islacrusez> so much for not trying to learn programming languages at 5am ><
2011-10-24T23:41:43  <Islacrusez> ok, gnight folks
2011-10-24T23:42:05  <burny> later
2011-10-24T23:42:09  <Alexer> ...damn, it's already 7am o.O
