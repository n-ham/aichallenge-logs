2011-03-10T00:00:00  <McLeopold> at some point
2011-03-10T00:00:02  <jmcarthur> huh?
2011-03-10T00:00:03  <jmcarthur> yeah...
2011-03-10T00:00:17  <jmcarthur> why not just make gameLoop, update, and finishTurn all the same thing?
2011-03-10T00:00:39  <McLeopold> because it is good practice to make function do a single thing
2011-03-10T00:00:54  <McLeopold> it would be easier for a beginner to understand the different parts
2011-03-10T00:00:57  <jmcarthur> well, mine has all that stuff separate, but it's still just one function call
2011-03-10T00:01:55  <McLeopold> I'm thinking that if we can make all the starters more consistent, it will be easier to help people with questions about them
2011-03-10T00:01:59  <jmcarthur> like... you have a few monad transformers that have different parts of the functionality and they all implement the same interface. if you compose them then you get the complete functionality, but you can also stick your own components in to do additional or different things
2011-03-10T00:02:21  <McLeopold> haskell is going to differ the most, I think
2011-03-10T00:02:41  <jmcarthur> i don't even think this naming scheme quite works for the library i'm making
2011-03-10T00:02:49  <McLeopold> which is why if we can agree on a good spec for the starter bots, then we've covered most of the languages
2011-03-10T00:02:50  <jmcarthur> i could just try to match as close as i can
2011-03-10T00:02:56  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-03-10T00:03:42  <McLeopold> I didn't even mention separating a library from the bot logic, I should have
2011-03-10T00:07:26  <jmcarthur> well, the library i'm doing has different components for getting and parsing input, for updating seen water, for handling output, for handling static information about the game, and for managing turn-by-turn information and aborting the game loop cleanly while providing meaningful debugging information
2011-03-10T00:07:46  <jmcarthur> they are intended to be composed with each other, and they all contribute to a few common interfaces
2011-03-10T00:08:21  <jmcarthur> and i don't think it's really the kind of thing most starter writers will want to do for most languages
2011-03-10T00:09:50  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-10T00:10:18  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: " are we wanting the starters to track water at all?" well yeah, you only get told about water once :P
2011-03-10T00:10:58  <McLeopold> let me put in some info on the wiki about what should be tracked in the game state
2011-03-10T00:11:09  <antimatroid> i am just tracking water
2011-03-10T00:11:09  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i mean as opposed to making the developers handle that themselves
2011-03-10T00:11:34  <antimatroid> i think we should at least track water in the starter bots
2011-03-10T00:11:54  <jmcarthur> my water tracking is optional/extensible
2011-03-10T00:12:22  <jmcarthur> so if somebody comes along and "knows better" they don't even suffer any performance penalty or boilerplate
2011-03-10T00:13:43  <antimatroid> i expect anyone who cares about performance to write their own bot from scratch
2011-03-10T00:14:09  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: "Depending on the order of the ants, you may get different results with the same configuration of ants."  <-- does that imply that we should be avoiding sending ants to collide with each other in the starters too?
2011-03-10T00:14:19  <antimatroid> i think the objective of the starter bots should be to be as helpful as possible for beginners who may not be able to do their own rewrite
2011-03-10T00:14:20  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: i consider that a waste
2011-03-10T00:14:21  <bss03> antimatroid: jmcarthur wants to be able to swap out pieces.
2011-03-10T00:14:38  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: you simply can't release something that will work the way everyone wants
2011-03-10T00:14:41  <bss03> antimatroid: That way it's not al or nothing = huge skill gap.
2011-03-10T00:14:48  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: you aren't used to good languages. shut up :)
2011-03-10T00:14:52  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-10T00:16:06  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: "i think the objective of the starter bots should be to be as helpful as possible for beginners who may not be able to do their own rewrite"  <-- that is also one of my objectives
2011-03-10T00:16:38  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: yes, avoid sending ants to the same square, but do it naively.
2011-03-10T00:16:51  <jmcarthur> but i'd like to do it without alienating the majority of developers who know what they are doing
2011-03-10T00:17:00  <antimatroid> that is my objective, with a side note of being reasonably efficient
2011-03-10T00:17:31  <antimatroid> i think people could re use most of my code if they wanted, but i imagine a lot of people will just write their own for c++
2011-03-10T00:17:48  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: how naively?
2011-03-10T00:17:56  <McLeopold> it should also showcase good design and best practices for the language
2011-03-10T00:18:09  <antimatroid> McLeopold: we are avoiding collisions now?
2011-03-10T00:18:45  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: 1 at a time, don't move on an ant, whether it has been given an order or not.
2011-03-10T00:18:55  <jmcarthur> i was considering making a component to somewhat intelligently avoid collisions, but that could be overstepping what a starter should be
2011-03-10T00:18:58  <McLeopold> so, that means updating the state in the issue_order function
2011-03-10T00:19:30  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: so... the starter should be tracking the new positions of ants as it issues orders? doesn't sound very naive to me
2011-03-10T00:19:50  <jmcarthur> well, not starter-level naive
2011-03-10T00:20:23  <McLeopold> Then I'll make it optional
2011-03-10T00:20:24  *** chemuduguntar <chemuduguntar!~ravic@smtp.touchcut.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-03-10T00:20:35  <jmcarthur> i was thinking "naive" might mean "don't move an ant to a position where another ant is already, regardless of whether it will be moving
2011-03-10T00:20:51  <jmcarthur> so if you have AA. and try to move both of them to the right, only the right one will move
2011-03-10T00:21:08  <McLeopold> unless the right one moves first
2011-03-10T00:21:13  <jmcarthur> and that would be regardless of ordering
2011-03-10T00:21:32  <McLeopold> maybe your language is too powerful :)
2011-03-10T00:21:42  <jmcarthur> no this is simpler
2011-03-10T00:21:46  <jmcarthur> *more naive
2011-03-10T00:21:58  <jmcarthur> you just don't update some internal game state just because an order was given
2011-03-10T00:22:03  <McLeopold> but then, 2 ants could go to the same spot
2011-03-10T00:22:11  <jmcarthur> yeah. naive
2011-03-10T00:22:16  <jmcarthur> it's avoiding some collisions, not all
2011-03-10T00:22:35  <McLeopold> okay, let's say the first item in the stategy guide will be avoiding collision
2011-03-10T00:22:51  <jmcarthur> that's what i thought the original plan was :)
2011-03-10T00:22:54  <McLeopold> and we can specify that the starter should not include the logic
2011-03-10T00:23:15  <antimatroid> my collision avoidance is as follows: don't move into a square containing an ant, once i've moved an ant, implement that move
2011-03-10T00:23:15  <McLeopold> I've been losing track, which is why I started the wiki page
2011-03-10T00:24:03  <jmcarthur> what kind of collision avoidance should the strategy guide have?
2011-03-10T00:24:07  <sigh> what does no logic?
2011-03-10T00:24:08  <jmcarthur> decent?
2011-03-10T00:24:09  <sigh> mean?
2011-03-10T00:24:26  <jmcarthur> sigh: it means just don't look for ant-ant collisions
2011-03-10T00:24:30  <jmcarthur> only look for ant-water collisions
2011-03-10T00:24:40  <sigh> oh ok
2011-03-10T00:24:53  <sigh> it's a flexible definition of "no"
2011-03-10T00:25:19  <jmcarthur> i'm looking for an occurrence of "no logic"
2011-03-10T00:25:23  <jmcarthur> not seeing it
2011-03-10T00:25:32  <antimatroid> "not include the logic"
2011-03-10T00:25:50  <jmcarthur> "not include the logic [for avoiding ant-ant collisions]"
2011-03-10T00:25:58  <sigh> ah, my sucky reading comprehension
2011-03-10T00:27:24  <jmcarthur> "Optionally attempt to remember ants and food that was last seen."  <-- sounds way beyond starter-level to me, too
2011-03-10T00:27:55  <jmcarthur> and sounds like something that could be a critical part of a bot... like, most people wouldn't want to stick to a default one anyway
2011-03-10T00:28:11  <jmcarthur> IMO, it's stuff like that that leads people to rewrite unnecessarily
2011-03-10T00:29:00  <sigh> yeah, I remember planet wars had dody data structures which forced anyone serious to rewrite
2011-03-10T00:29:00  <McLeopold> so, I should take it out?
2011-03-10T00:29:08  <sigh> *dodgy
2011-03-10T00:29:33  <sigh> just put stuff like that in a strategy guide?
2011-03-10T00:29:37  <McLeopold> yeah, I lot of beginners felt obligated to keep the fleet class
2011-03-10T00:29:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i would take it out unless you can put a very specific algorithm in instead of a vague description
2011-03-10T00:29:56  <jmcarthur> even then... maybe that is strategy guide material
2011-03-10T00:31:06  <jmcarthur> yeah i'd say it's strategy guide worthy
2011-03-10T00:31:16  <sigh> also, there is no obviously optimal way to reason about unseen food and ants, right?
2011-03-10T00:31:19  *** _flag <_flag!~flag@69-165-173-172.dsl.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Lost terminal)
2011-03-10T00:31:41  <McLeopold> no, I don't think so
2011-03-10T00:31:47  <jmcarthur> "determine difference between unseen area and land"  <-- does that mean "distinguish between land and unseen squares which could actually be water"?
2011-03-10T00:32:14  <McLeopold> yes, but it's gone now :)
2011-03-10T00:32:14  <jmcarthur> i was debating whether to add that
2011-03-10T00:32:16  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-10T00:32:32  <sigh> remembering that might be a candidate for starter I think
2011-03-10T00:32:35  <sigh> becuase that never changes
2011-03-10T00:32:46  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-10T00:32:54  <jmcarthur> well
2011-03-10T00:32:56  <jmcarthur> not necessarily
2011-03-10T00:33:06  <jmcarthur> if maps are known to be symmetrical then a bot could try to guess
2011-03-10T00:33:20  <McLeopold> how about a visible helper function that returns true/false for a square?
2011-03-10T00:33:23  <jmcarthur> heck, even if it's only known that *some* maps are symmetrical, a bot might try to guess
2011-03-10T00:33:24  <sigh> symetreical maps are not part of the spec, right?
2011-03-10T00:33:30  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-10T00:33:30  <jmcarthur> they don't need to be
2011-03-10T00:33:31  <sigh> I can't spell
2011-03-10T00:33:40  <jmcarthur> it could just be some fraction of maps are symmetrical
2011-03-10T00:33:49  <jmcarthur> *happen to be
2011-03-10T00:33:51  <sigh> then they shouldn't be assumed in the starter pack, or strategy guide
2011-03-10T00:34:01  <jmcarthur> i wasn't suggesting that assumption
2011-03-10T00:34:03  <antimatroid> when were they assumed?
2011-03-10T00:34:11  <jmcarthur> i was just saying that it's not something that necessarily stays static
2011-03-10T00:34:14  <antimatroid> i think we should play around with both and see what works both
2011-03-10T00:34:19  <antimatroid> if both work well, we can do a combination
2011-03-10T00:34:29  <antimatroid> works best*
2011-03-10T00:34:35  <sigh> I was just inferring things I shouldn't again when jmcarthur said "if maps are known to be symmetrical then a bot could try to guess"
2011-03-10T00:34:42  <jmcarthur> sigh: it was in response to "because that never changes"
2011-03-10T00:35:11  <sigh> i see
2011-03-10T00:35:35  <jmcarthur> like, it's true that whether or not a square has been seen never changes
2011-03-10T00:36:05  <jmcarthur> but that doesn't mean that you will always want this ternary state for each square of the bot's internal map
2011-03-10T00:36:13  <sigh> sure
2011-03-10T00:36:20  <antimatroid> what?
2011-03-10T00:36:21  <jmcarthur> you may want to eventually put some probabilities in there or something instead
2011-03-10T00:36:27  <antimatroid> when you see a square, doesn't that value cahnge?
2011-03-10T00:36:30  <antimatroid> the first time
2011-03-10T00:37:18  <jmcarthur> like if the bot hasn't seen enough of the map to determine whether or not it's symmetrical, it's very unsure of things, but once it has seen enough to be 90% sure that it's symmetrical, it can go ahead and guess most of the rest of the water positions with decent accuracy
2011-03-10T00:37:36  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: this is about whether or not the *code* for that will change throughout the contest
2011-03-10T00:37:49  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: it's a bit of work to find out if it's symmetrical
2011-03-10T00:38:01  <antimatroid> you need to find rtranslate and ctranslate from pattern matching?
2011-03-10T00:38:02  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: not that much. just see if anything appears to be repeating
2011-03-10T00:38:15  <jmcarthur> sure why not?
2011-03-10T00:38:24  <jmcarthur> it may be a little involved, but probably worth it
2011-03-10T00:38:31  <sigh> jmcarthur: oh, I was talking about the knowledge about the squares during a game... didn't even realize you were talking about the *code* during the contest
2011-03-10T00:38:37  <antimatroid> yes, i'm just pointing out it isn't entirely trivial :)
2011-03-10T00:38:45  <jmcarthur> sigh: ah, that's why we were talking over each other's heads then
2011-03-10T00:38:58  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: doesn't mean it won't happen ;)
2011-03-10T00:39:15  <antimatroid> i suspect one could maybe just hash nxn square blocks and find number of appearances?
2011-03-10T00:39:20  <antimatroid> you could probably do it well like that
2011-03-10T00:39:29  <antimatroid> i know it will happen, i intend on doing it myself
2011-03-10T00:39:36  <sigh> my point was essentially, once you see a water square then you know for sure that it will be there for the rest of the game, and it is obvious how to handle that
2011-03-10T00:39:37  <jmcarthur> hashing would be problematic if there is just one square in there you've missed
2011-03-10T00:39:42  <sigh> unlike ants and food
2011-03-10T00:39:46  <McLeopold> Okay, more changes, refresh and read
2011-03-10T00:39:53  <jmcarthur> sigh: true
2011-03-10T00:40:31  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: true, i don't think it'll be very easy at all :P
2011-03-10T00:40:59  <sigh> are you talking about detecting symettries?
2011-03-10T00:41:03  <antimatroid> that's one of the things i like about this game, there are LOTS of obvious things to do that will make the bot smarter
2011-03-10T00:41:04  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it's another thing to put in the strategy guide
2011-03-10T00:41:11  <antimatroid> and require playing around with different things
2011-03-10T00:41:20  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ah, you meant for "game loop" to actually mean a real loop and not a function call of some sort
2011-03-10T00:41:27  <jmcarthur> i misinterpreted
2011-03-10T00:41:52  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-10T00:42:12  <McLeopold> should I clarify?
2011-03-10T00:42:23  <jmcarthur> well, it's listed under "Core Functions"
2011-03-10T00:42:47  <McLeopold> yeah, function in the broader sense of the word
2011-03-10T00:42:53  <McLeopold> "Sub Routine"?
2011-03-10T00:43:17  <jmcarthur> "Core Functionality"?
2011-03-10T00:43:47  <McLeopold> I watched a bit of Stargate Universe on Monday when they used that term in the show.  I laughed and told my friend they were programming in BASIC.
2011-03-10T00:44:50  <jmcarthur> i'm avoiding writing a game loop as part of the library. the starter will have one, but with the intent to be redesigned as needed
2011-03-10T00:45:34  <McLeopold> I put a game loop in the java and python bots.
2011-03-10T00:45:56  <McLeopold> They don't have to use it, but it is good enough that even serious programmers could just stick with it for the contest.
2011-03-10T00:46:03  <jmcarthur> well, there will be one in the starter. it's just not "core functionality" in the sense that it's basically just a one-liner in the main fail
2011-03-10T00:46:07  <jmcarthur> s/fail/file/
2011-03-10T00:46:34  <McLeopold> oh yeah, I was going to talk about a library
2011-03-10T00:46:36  <jmcarthur> forever $ <game logic goes here>
2011-03-10T00:48:07  <McLeopold> is haskell OOP?
2011-03-10T00:48:35  <jmcarthur> haskell... can be used to make OOP code. however, it's rarely the best design
2011-03-10T00:48:57  <jmcarthur> in any case, most OOP programmers wouldn't recognize it as the kind of OOP they know and love
2011-03-10T00:49:30  <jmcarthur> at least, not the opinionated ones
2011-03-10T00:49:58  <McLeopold> okay, more changes, refresh and read.
2011-03-10T00:50:10  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm going to hack apart your game spec
2011-03-10T00:50:22  <antimatroid> go for it
2011-03-10T00:50:37  <jmcarthur> you can implement message passing or F-coalgebras in haskell, which are two common definitions for OOP, but most people don't even know what an F-coalgebra is
2011-03-10T00:50:41  <McLeopold> I'm just going to separate it into sub pages
2011-03-10T00:50:59  <McLeopold> I'm one of them. :)
2011-03-10T00:51:46  <jmcarthur> heck, i only know enough about it to make a simple object and know what it is, but i don't know any deep theory about it or anything
2011-03-10T00:52:17  <jmcarthur> i like it more than message passing though. more amenable to static type checking and purity :)

2011-03-10T00:53:43  <McLeopold> good
2011-03-10T00:54:18  <McLeopold> ooh, forgot the timing mechanism
2011-03-10T00:54:36  <jmcarthur> ah yeah. i still need to add a component for that to my new lib
2011-03-10T00:54:53  <jmcarthur> i'm basically just providing a way to get the amount of time remaining for the current turn
2011-03-10T00:55:16  <McLeopold> amstan: if you look at the github wiki, my Ants Starter Pack Guide is red, I can't figure out how to make it blue?
2011-03-10T00:55:17  <jmcarthur> i debated adding some sort of interruptive timer, but i think that's unnecessary
2011-03-10T00:55:42  <McLeopold> I think just a true/false function to determine if you should still loop through ants is good enough
2011-03-10T00:55:59  <McLeopold> It give an example for the language
2011-03-10T00:56:06  <jmcarthur> err... how does the function know whether to go through the loop though?
2011-03-10T00:56:24  <jmcarthur> oh, you mean to demonstrate the timer in the bot?
2011-03-10T00:56:27  <jmcarthur> *in the starter?
2011-03-10T00:56:40  <McLeopold> yeah, all language have very different "get_time" functions
2011-03-10T00:56:55  <jmcarthur> it could be a part of the starter interface though
2011-03-10T00:57:12  <McLeopold> I'll add it to the optional list of functions
2011-03-10T00:57:14  <jmcarthur> like just have a timeRemaining function
2011-03-10T00:57:17  <jmcarthur> yeah, optional is good
2011-03-10T00:57:36  <sigh> what kind of time are we measuing?
2011-03-10T00:57:41  <sigh> measuring?
2011-03-10T00:57:42  <jmcarthur> wall clock
2011-03-10T00:57:51  <McLeopold> milliseconds
2011-03-10T00:57:57  <McLeopold> so it matches the bot input
2011-03-10T00:58:00  <sigh> hehe
2011-03-10T00:58:12  <jmcarthur> wall clock should be more reliable this time around if we make the bots execute sequentially and pause them between turns
2011-03-10T00:58:20  <McLeopold> hopefully
2011-03-10T00:58:22  <jmcarthur> s/reliable/reliable and fair/
2011-03-10T00:58:31  <sigh> why are they executed sequentially?
2011-03-10T00:58:38  <jmcarthur> more bots than cores
2011-03-10T00:58:42  <jmcarthur> in a game
2011-03-10T00:58:48  <sigh> i see
2011-03-10T00:59:17  <janzert> just read some of the recent conversation; why doesn't the engine treat all ant moves as simultaneous?
2011-03-10T00:59:29  <jmcarthur> janzert: the *engine* should
2011-03-10T00:59:43  <jmcarthur> janzert: this is about the bots view of issuing orders
2011-03-10T00:59:48  <janzert> ahh, must have misread something then
2011-03-10T01:00:02  <jmcarthur> s/this is/that was/
2011-03-10T01:00:07  <janzert> well, any order or err, orders should be fine
2011-03-10T01:00:29  <janzert> i.e. lead to the same result
2011-03-10T01:00:51  <jmcarthur> janzert: the proposal was to have some internal representation of the map in the bot such that ants are moved immediately when orders are issued, which is a naive way to look for collisions
2011-03-10T01:01:20  <jmcarthur> that way the bot can avoid actually issuing orders resulting in collisions
2011-03-10T01:01:20  <janzert> ahh, ok so something easy but not quite completely correct
2011-03-10T01:01:25  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-10T01:01:54  <jmcarthur> but when you phrase it that way it makes me think we should definitely not be encouraging beginners to run with it like that
2011-03-10T01:02:22  <McLeopold> we should encourage them to notice the mistake and fix it
2011-03-10T01:02:36  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: yes, if we were to include that in the first place
2011-03-10T01:02:47  <jmcarthur> janzert: anyway, the final decision i think was that collision avoidance should be part of the strategy guide and not the starter itself
2011-03-10T01:03:05  <janzert> ok
2011-03-10T01:03:29  <janzert> I was mostly just afraid that was the way the engine was actually handling it
2011-03-10T01:03:46  <jmcarthur> that would be pretty bad
2011-03-10T01:03:53  * jmcarthur hopes that's not the way it works :)
2011-03-10T01:05:12  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: so ant-water collisions actually result in the engine ignoring the move altogether, right? what about ant-ant collisions? do they still kill the ants, or do they prevent one or both from moving?
2011-03-10T01:05:32  <McLeopold> ant-ant collisions kill the ants
2011-03-10T01:05:48  <McLeopold> ant-water is an invalid order and is ignored
2011-03-10T01:06:15  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: i was thinking... given the former property of the engine, i could just send four orders for each square on the map, regardless of the actual game state, and satisfy the game logic requirements of the starter guide :P
2011-03-10T01:06:32  <janzert> hehe
2011-03-10T01:06:36  <jmcarthur> s/former property/ant-water behavior/
2011-03-10T01:07:07  <janzert> you also need the 'ignore all invalid orders' property
2011-03-10T01:07:20  <jmcarthur> janzert: that's in there already. i had checked the source when i first thought of it
2011-03-10T01:07:27  <jmcarthur> hmm
2011-03-10T01:07:32  <jmcarthur> i don't know about all invalid orders
2011-03-10T01:07:38  <jmcarthur> but redundant orders are ignored, i know
2011-03-10T01:07:47  <jmcarthur> i think simply invalid ones are too though
2011-03-10T01:07:59  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: yep, your right
2011-03-10T01:08:53  <McLeopold> since this is multiplayer, we need to try and keep all bots participating, so there will be no bots removed from play do to bad output
2011-03-10T01:09:12  <McLeopold> unless the bad output is infinite...
2011-03-10T01:09:22  <McLeopold> in which case they will time out
2011-03-10T01:09:30  <jmcarthur> so just count the moves and it it's infinity they lose ;)
2011-03-10T01:09:46  <jmcarthur> *if
2011-03-10T01:09:53  <McLeopold> yes, but what magnitude of infinity?
2011-03-10T01:10:08  <sigh> what if they issue an uncountably infinite number of moves?
2011-03-10T01:10:17  <jmcarthur> we're just operating on the extended reals here. nothing fancy!
2011-03-10T01:10:26  <jmcarthur> *extended naturals
2011-03-10T01:10:29  <McLeopold> sigh: I'll just map them to the set of integers
2011-03-10T01:10:41  <sigh> McLeopold: good idea
2011-03-10T01:11:17  <McLeopold> negative integers, to rub it in
2011-03-10T01:11:28  <jmcarthur> that's their score :P
2011-03-10T01:11:44  <McLeopold> hmm... - 1 point for each bad order?
2011-03-10T01:12:16  <sigh> they should get imaginary points for bad orders
2011-03-10T01:12:19  <jmcarthur> bad orders are obviously bugs. i wouldn't mind if it nullified *all* their points, personally
2011-03-10T01:12:32  <jmcarthur> it would still mean they play to the end
2011-03-10T01:12:38  <jmcarthur> so that other bots get decent scores
2011-03-10T01:12:44  <McLeopold> yes, and keep the individual game balance
2011-03-10T01:12:51  <sigh> ahhh... the dead but they don't even know it way of dealing with things
2011-03-10T01:13:28  <jmcarthur> -1 point per bad move sounds reasonable to me, really
2011-03-10T01:13:44  <McLeopold> we could split their bot's input into a parallel universe game than never ended.
2011-03-10T01:13:44  <jmcarthur> but maybe restrict all final scores to non-negative numbers
2011-03-10T01:13:52  <sigh> I would rather just give them 0 points
2011-03-10T01:14:07  <jmcarthur> makes no difference to me at all
2011-03-10T01:14:22  <jmcarthur> buggy bots are buggy and they deserve whatever crap scores they get
2011-03-10T01:14:22  <sigh> why should a buggy bot get points?
2011-03-10T01:14:28  <McLeopold> maybe a too many bad orders threshold
2011-03-10T01:14:56  <sigh> nah, threshold just complicats things
2011-03-10T01:15:03  <jmcarthur> if we do this, i don't think ant-water collisions should be considered invalid such that they make you lose points
2011-03-10T01:15:13  <jmcarthur> it should just kill the ant
2011-03-10T01:15:19  <sigh> I agree
2011-03-10T01:15:26  <sigh> i mean logically ants should just drown
2011-03-10T01:15:43  <sigh> it makes sense
2011-03-10T01:16:01  <McLeopold> what if we go back to walls?
2011-03-10T01:16:30  <jmcarthur> but orders for ants that don't exist or for ants that have already been given orders should be "invalid" including whatever penalty that implies
2011-03-10T01:16:36  <McLeopold> then we have the suicide to prevent enemy points issue
2011-03-10T01:16:41  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-03-10T01:16:56  <jmcarthur> not sure that's so terrible, myself
2011-03-10T01:17:03  <sigh> I think it's good
2011-03-10T01:17:19  <jmcarthur> it's not very ant-like i guess...
2011-03-10T01:17:23  <jmcarthur> but neither is anything else about the game
2011-03-10T01:17:37  <sigh> that is the nature of points, not ants
2011-03-10T01:17:42  <sigh> or walls/water
2011-03-10T01:18:06  <jmcarthur> well, it's not ant-like to commit suicide in the name of points because ants don't care about points, especially not enough to commit suicide over them :P
2011-03-10T01:18:36  <sigh> if you say that, then it's not ant-like to care about points at all
2011-03-10T01:18:42  <jmcarthur> i agree
2011-03-10T01:18:50  <sigh> it might be ant-like to prefer a death by water than to be tortured by the enemy
2011-03-10T01:18:53  <jmcarthur> but suicides are even less ant-like
2011-03-10T01:18:56  <sigh> if you want a justification :P
2011-03-10T01:18:57  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-03-10T01:19:50  <janzert> having invalid orders reflect score changes that are not reflected in play behavior has a strong potential for weird ratings effects
2011-03-10T01:20:07  <sigh> i agree
2011-03-10T01:20:17  <sigh> i think it should be all or nothing
2011-03-10T01:20:37  <sigh> they either get 0 score, or their score is not affected
2011-03-10T01:20:59  <janzert> e.g. a bot that play fairly strongly but also issues lots invalid orders is going to continually play bots that it easily wipes out
2011-03-10T01:22:05  <McLeopold> janzert: whoever comes in "second" will get the benefit
2011-03-10T01:22:26  <McLeopold> meaning the strong bot could choose the ordering it wants
2011-03-10T01:22:42  <McLeopold> well, a strong bot could do that anyway
2011-03-10T01:24:30  <sigh> that's always going to be the case, yeah
2011-03-10T01:24:50  <jmcarthur> it's not a strong bot if its scores are miserable
2011-03-10T01:24:51  <janzert> there just really is no ideal way to deal with badly behaving bots, TANSTAAFL is in full effect here
2011-03-10T01:25:32  <sigh> is cooperation between bots explicitly discouraged?
2011-03-10T01:25:35  <jmcarthur> the ability to wipe out opposing teams of ants is insufficient to be considered a strong bot, is all i mean
2011-03-10T01:25:38  <McLeopold> sigh: no
2011-03-10T01:25:45  <sigh> interesting
2011-03-10T01:25:49  <jmcarthur> sigh: no, but i doubt it will happen much or at all
2011-03-10T01:25:57  <McLeopold> I'm planning it?
2011-03-10T01:26:04  <jmcarthur> really?
2011-03-10T01:26:10  <McLeopold> s/?/>:)/g
2011-03-10T01:26:12  <jmcarthur> how does that even work?
2011-03-10T01:26:24  <sigh> it would be fairly easy to develop a protocol to detect *friendly* bots
2011-03-10T01:26:30  <jmcarthur> does your plan require working it out with other developers in advance?
2011-03-10T01:26:33  <McLeopold> It will be an opt-in public feature.
2011-03-10T01:26:36  <jmcarthur> ah yeah with a protocol
2011-03-10T01:26:44  <jmcarthur> well in that case it's interesting
2011-03-10T01:27:00  <McLeopold> For *python* programmers only >:)
2011-03-10T01:27:04  <sigh> haha
2011-03-10T01:27:05  <jmcarthur> sigh: you mean to detect bots that are privy to your handshake at least
2011-03-10T01:27:14  <sigh> jmcarthur: yes
2011-03-10T01:27:27  <jmcarthur> communication is also exploitable >:)
2011-03-10T01:27:40  <McLeopold> yes, but fog of war give some cover
2011-03-10T01:27:59  <McLeopold> I already have a protocol worked out.
2011-03-10T01:28:02  <sigh> time to authentication schemes :P
2011-03-10T01:28:03  <sigh> haha
2011-03-10T01:29:10  <McLeopold> The real problem is what to communicate and how to get as much information per turn without wasting too many ants.

2011-03-10T01:29:37  <McLeopold> but if you have a friendly you are not fighting, then you probably have some left over anyway
2011-03-10T01:29:42  <sigh> true, but you can afford to waste quite a few ants if you are working together
2011-03-10T01:29:46  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-10T01:30:04  <sigh> you could dedicate a bunch to communication
2011-03-10T01:30:15  <McLeopold> maybe I'll write the protocol in malbloge...
2011-03-10T01:30:16  <sigh> but hmm... only 2 bits/ant/turn?
2011-03-10T01:30:26  <sigh> is that right?
2011-03-10T01:30:59  <McLeopold> maybe less? you can't have them wondering too far
2011-03-10T01:31:08  <sigh> yeah, I meant as a maximum
2011-03-10T01:32:07  <janzert> move in one of 4 directions or stand still, 2bits + 1 maximum I believe
2011-03-10T01:32:18  <jmcarthur> we're talking pretty low bandwidth
2011-03-10T01:32:56  <jmcarthur> it's tougher than that due to other aspects of the game, like sight range, combat range, food, number of ants in area, etc.
2011-03-10T01:33:09  <McLeopold> just knowing they will hold a truce is powerful enough
2011-03-10T01:33:21  <jmcarthur> i think we'd be lucky to get an average of 1 bit per visible ant
2011-03-10T01:34:22  <McLeopold> janzert: I'm going to totally merge the branch sometime tomorrow.
2011-03-10T01:34:30  <McLeopold> ish
2011-03-10T01:34:35  <janzert> great :)

2011-03-10T05:15:41  <aerique> once a bot has received the end turn data it can just die, aight?  the game engine doesn't expect a 'go' or anything
2011-03-10T05:24:58  <Frontier> I wonder if the engine even lets the bot read the end game state or just say, "so, match is over you can read the results at home"
2011-03-10T05:26:30  <aerique> Frontier: right, good point

2011-03-10T07:22:46  <sigh> antimatroid?
2011-03-10T07:29:10  <antimatroid1> yeah shoot
2011-03-10T07:29:23  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure it's using option 2 atm
2011-03-10T07:29:33  <antimatroid1> slightly annoying, but it was the second option to come up
2011-03-10T07:30:14  <antimatroid1> sigh: ^^
2011-03-10T07:30:42  <sigh> it's this one: "If more than one ant is in a square once all moves have been made, each of these ants automatically dies."
2011-03-10T07:30:43  <sigh> ?
2011-03-10T07:30:51  <sigh> that's what's on the spec sheet
2011-03-10T07:31:32  <antimatroid1> yeah, that's for ant collisions
2011-03-10T07:31:59  <sigh> and it is supposed to be order independent, right?
2011-03-10T07:32:04  <antimatroid1> yes
2011-03-10T07:32:09  <antimatroid1> is it not?
2011-03-10T07:32:29  <sigh> I don't think ants.py is
2011-03-10T07:32:43  <antimatroid1> hmm, it should move all ants, then kill any ants in a square with more than one
2011-03-10T07:32:48  <sigh> relevant function: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/ants/ants.py#L299
2011-03-10T07:33:20  <sigh> do_orders is called for each player in turn, then resolve_orders is called after all players have been processed
2011-03-10T07:34:01  <sigh> problem is that checking for conflicts (L338) occurs before all players have made their moves
2011-03-10T07:34:12  <antimatroid1> hmmm, can you raise issues on git for mcleopold?
2011-03-10T07:34:17  <antimatroid1> that is a big bug
2011-03-10T07:34:40  <sigh> if it's an issue, I'm fixing it as part of the changes I'm currently making
2011-03-10T07:34:48  <antimatroid1> okay cool
2011-03-10T07:34:52  <antimatroid1> that's definitely an issue
2011-03-10T07:35:29  <sigh> but can you see the issue I am talking about? or you don't want to decipher the code?
2011-03-10T07:35:31  <sigh> :P
2011-03-10T07:36:14  <sigh> how do I raise an issue?
2011-03-10T07:36:18  <antimatroid1> i haven't deciphered it all, but if it's calling do_orders sequentially and looking for conflicts when it checks, i know how it can break :P
2011-03-10T07:36:26  <antimatroid1> i have no idea how to raise an issue, that's why i was asking if you can :P
2011-03-10T07:36:31  <sigh> haha
2011-03-10T07:36:47  <antimatroid1> you can do the later tell thing
2011-03-10T07:36:50  <sigh> I should probably raise an issue rather than @later tell in the channel
2011-03-10T07:37:13  <Frontier> At least it is row,col now :)
2011-03-10T07:37:30  <Frontier> I'm ok with row,col and x,y, but not with col,row or y,x
2011-03-10T07:37:46  <antimatroid1> sigh: there's a create issue link on git in the issues section
2011-03-10T07:38:20  <antimatroid1> Frontier: if you read maps from file, or output a char map to the screen and use x,y, you HAVE to use y,x too, that's why i think it's inferior and don't understand programmers using it
2011-03-10T07:38:28  <antimatroid1> i'd be fine with it simply being a difference in standard
2011-03-10T07:38:28  <sigh> meh
2011-03-10T07:40:11  <sigh> @later tell McLeopold possible bug in ants.py, read channel logs from 2011-03-10T07:22:41 for details, please confirm... I will fix
2011-03-10T07:40:11  <contestbot> sigh: As you wish.
2011-03-10T07:40:31  <Frontier> maybe it is a bike shed, too :(
2011-03-10T07:41:20  <antimatroid1> sigh: you don't need confirmation, the current method is clearly wrong :P

2011-03-10T08:05:20  <sigh> antimatroid1: what causes conflicts to show up on the map?
2011-03-10T08:08:56  <antimatroid1> conflicts? when more than one ant ends up in the same square after movement?
2011-03-10T08:09:05  <antimatroid1> erm...?
2011-03-10T08:10:17  <Frontier> in other words a bot's stupidness
2011-03-10T08:12:40  <sigh> antimatroid1: in ants.py conflicts are show in the outptu the bot?
2011-03-10T08:13:04  <sigh> with prefix "d"
2011-03-10T08:13:20  <sigh> oh, that's just deaths?
2011-03-10T08:13:31  <antimatroid1> wait, we're told about ants that died from collisions?
2011-03-10T08:14:00  <antimatroid1> hmm, i'd prefer to distinguish those from ants that died from battle
2011-03-10T08:14:13  <antimatroid1> explicitly that is
2011-03-10T08:14:22  <sigh> I don't know... I'm trying to figure out wtf a 600 python script is doing
2011-03-10T08:14:27  <antimatroid1> :P
2011-03-10T08:14:28  <sigh> *600 line
2011-03-10T08:17:42  <sigh> ok, I understand what he's doing now
2011-03-10T08:18:57  <antimatroid1> we had a sweet game going saturday night, tree darts
2011-03-10T08:19:01  <antimatroid1> the previous person to throw the dart is the "climber", if the current thrower gets the dart in the tree, the climber has to go and get it
2011-03-10T08:20:17  <phreeza> was alcohol involved?
2011-03-10T08:20:34  <antimatroid1> well yeah :P
2011-03-10T08:20:36  <phreeza> :D
2011-03-10T08:20:50  <antimatroid1> it's stil a sweet game
2011-03-10T08:20:58  <antimatroid1> i've done a surprising amount of tree climbing this year
2011-03-10T08:20:59  <phreeza> yea sounds fun
2011-03-10T08:21:22  <antimatroid1> considering i can't remember the last time i climbed one prior to this year
2011-03-10T08:23:56  <phreeza> i think i'm to heavy now

2011-03-10T11:58:56  <amstan> McLeopold: so now epsilon-new-schema is up to date with the changes from epsilon
2011-03-10T11:59:15  <amstan> McLeopold: i think that's what you wanted, but you're not supposed to do this with cherry picking
2011-03-10T12:00:05  <McLeopold> amstan: I thought you wanted me to merge the other way
2011-03-10T12:00:12  <amstan> McLeopold: nope
2011-03-10T12:00:18  <McLeopold> so only epsilon was left
2011-03-10T12:00:23  <amstan> McLeopold: anyway, you ok with that then?
2011-03-10T12:00:42  <McLeopold> yeah, but it is a broken system...
2011-03-10T12:00:49  <McLeopold> Also, I'd like to do it, so I can learn

2011-03-10T12:02:10  <amstan> ok.. from what i understood.. what you wanted is to update the -new-schema branch with some of the things from epsilon
2011-03-10T12:02:23  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-10T12:02:28  <amstan> and i did that with the merge

2011-03-10T12:07:33  <McLeopold> dang, I looked away
2011-03-10T12:07:43  <amstan> McLeopold: you also merged from a previous commit
2011-03-10T12:07:44  <McLeopold> amstan: sry, didn't see the wait request
2011-03-10T12:07:54  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-03-10T12:07:56  <amstan> that's fine..
2011-03-10T12:08:27  <McLeopold> so, I should have git checkout epsilon, git pull, git checkout epsilon-new-schema, get merge epsilon?
2011-03-10T12:08:55  <janzert> would just git pull do it?
2011-03-10T12:09:05  <McLeopold> apparently not
2011-03-10T12:09:06  <amstan> yeah
2011-03-10T12:09:14  <McLeopold> ?
2011-03-10T12:09:48  <McLeopold> amstan: did you get the lisp starter in yet?
2011-03-10T12:09:58  <amstan> yeah.. trying to figure where the pull button is
2011-03-10T12:10:02  <amstan> if there is one
2011-03-10T12:10:04  <janzert> so pull only gets the latest info for your current branch not the full repo?
2011-03-10T12:10:10  <McLeopold> not on the website
2011-03-10T12:10:10  <jmcarthur> pull button?
2011-03-10T12:10:19  <jmcarthur> oh, non-locally
2011-03-10T12:10:24  <McLeopold> you have to use git tools locally

2011-03-10T12:10:31  <UncleVasya> Hi. Sorry for my terrible English. Can you already tell me when i have to free my time for the upcoming contest: in two weeks, in one month or in few monthes?
2011-03-10T12:10:57  <McLeopold> UncleVasya: closer to 2 weeks than 1 month, but it's still hard to say.
2011-03-10T12:11:20  <amstan> 3.5 weeks? lol
2011-03-10T12:11:27  <janzert> I was going to say most likely a month but maybe sooner :)
2011-03-10T12:11:44  <janzert> certainly hard to say at this point

2011-03-10T12:17:24  <jmcarthur> nothing like changing your text editor's color theme to make every project feel new again

2011-03-10T12:20:08  <jmcarthur> huh?
2011-03-10T12:20:18  <jmcarthur> i changed emacs' color theme
2011-03-10T12:21:35  <McLeopold> I suppose I was asking for the name of your editor of choice, and the name of your new color theme?
2011-03-10T12:23:16  <jmcarthur> emacs + zenburn, but i'm thinking about trying to up the contrast a little bit
2011-03-10T12:23:36  <jmcarthur> it's designed for low light conditions, so is a low contrast theme, but *usually* i'm not in low light conditions

2011-03-10T12:24:19  <amstan> what do you guys think of the Versions section: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues#issue/3
2011-03-10T12:24:25  <amstan> janzert: ^
2011-03-10T12:24:29  <McLeopold> I prefer mustang, in vi
2011-03-10T12:25:23  <McLeopold> amstan: I'd go with 32bit
2011-03-10T12:25:48  <janzert> sure, although I don't think it's a strict priority order if the contributor is willing to set one of the lower priorities up so they get a more recent version
2011-03-10T12:25:50  <McLeopold> amstan: also, do I have the ability to update issues?
2011-03-10T12:26:07  <amstan> McLeopold: you cannot edit comments that are not your own
2011-03-10T12:26:15  <amstan> McLeopold: but anyone can do whatever
2011-03-10T12:26:45  <amstan> janzert: i'll add something about that, good idea
2011-03-10T12:27:05  <jmcarthur> the new haskell platform should be coming out today i think
2011-03-10T12:27:14  <jmcarthur> oh well
2011-03-10T12:28:26  <amstan> janzert: + This is not a strict list, but it would make it much easier for the sysadmin to install the language/starter pack.
2011-03-10T12:28:40  <jmcarthur> shouldn't there be a setup script anyway though?
2011-03-10T12:28:58  <amstan> jmcarthur: where?
2011-03-10T12:29:08  <amstan> jmcarthur: for the languages?
2011-03-10T12:29:15  <janzert> sounds good, might want to mention that to ensure use installation of the language needs to be added to the worker_setup.py script
2011-03-10T12:29:19  <jmcarthur> for everything needed on the server/workers
2011-03-10T12:29:22  <jmcarthur> including languages
2011-03-10T12:29:35  <amstan> ok.. i was not aware of that
2011-03-10T12:29:37  <jmcarthur> amstan: what janzert said ;)
2011-03-10T12:29:41  <amstan> janzert: 32 or 64bit?
2011-03-10T12:29:43  <jmcarthur> makes it really easy
2011-03-10T12:29:57  <jmcarthur> lowers the barrier for harder-to-install languages and stuff
2011-03-10T12:30:04  <janzert> I'd prefer that we let people use 64bit this time
2011-03-10T12:30:15  <jmcarthur> i mean, of course we want to use versions that are easy for people to set up at home
2011-03-10T12:30:17  <janzert> but I'm not positive about that
2011-03-10T12:30:28  <delt0r__> 64bit has been out for over 5 years
2011-03-10T12:30:37  <amstan> janzert: let's just make sure there exists a 64 bit version, even if we don't use it
2011-03-10T12:30:37  <delt0r__> surly thats what we all use right?
2011-03-10T12:30:40  <janzert> primarily it means we need to use a different ec2 instance type
2011-03-10T12:30:44  <amstan> we shouldn't accept runtimes that only work on 32bits
2011-03-10T12:30:50  <jmcarthur> 64 bit machines can run 32 bit VMs. the reverse is not necessarily true
2011-03-10T12:31:06  <janzert> nah, for sure I'd accept 32bit if that is all there is
2011-03-10T12:31:20  <janzert> just if there is a choice, prefer the 64bit one
2011-03-10T12:31:25  <jmcarthur> i personally prefer 64 bit as well, but i don't know what our demographics are like
2011-03-10T12:32:07  <janzert> the 32bit runtime should run fine whether we end up using 64bit or 32bit OS
2011-03-10T12:32:11  <jmcarthur> sucks to code C and only be able to test on 32 bit if the server uses 64 bit
2011-03-10T12:32:38  <jmcarthur> i mean, if you don't suck at C you can do it, but... most people suck at C :)
2011-03-10T12:33:06  <janzert> actually that reminds me we did have 64bit for tron
2011-03-10T12:33:35  <janzert> cause it was a pain debugging my assembly 64bit population count without access to a 64bit gcc locally
2011-03-10T12:33:38  <jmcarthur> i think it best to try to be consistent, whatever we choose. if we say 64 bit, try to support 64 bit across the board
2011-03-10T12:33:59  <jmcarthur> 32 bit is obviously a bit easier in this regard
2011-03-10T12:34:37  <jmcarthur> for certain kinds of cpu/memory patterns 64 bit is faster, but aside from that the only other advantage really is the ability to address more memory, which should be far beyond the limits of our sandbox anyway

2011-03-10T12:42:47  <amstan> This is not a strict list, but it would make it much easier to install the language/starter pack.
2011-03-10T12:42:49  <amstan> If you do want a language to be supported, please modify worker_setup.py accordingly.
2011-03-10T12:42:51  <amstan> how's that ^?
2011-03-10T12:43:22  <jmcarthur> yeah i think that's good, as long as we have a decent way of testing it
2011-03-10T12:43:54  <jmcarthur> well, if it's just an ubuntu package no big deal, but if it's downloading and building from source and stuff then we need to be careful
2011-03-10T12:44:23  <amstan> jmcarthur: i kept the list for that

2011-03-10T13:01:57  <janzert> what script or what machine?
2011-03-10T13:02:14  <janzert> at the moment from compile_anything.py on the main server
2011-03-10T13:02:30  <janzert> that will almost certainly move to the worker before the contest though
2011-03-10T13:10:35  <amstan> janzert: ok
2011-03-10T13:11:07  <amstan> janzert: so.. if we move the compilation to the workers too, what will be left in managers besides the rankings?
2011-03-10T13:11:27  <janzert> basically rankings and pairing :)
2011-03-10T13:11:38  <janzert> handing out tasks to the workers
2011-03-10T13:12:45  <jmcarthur> i suppose the manager server could also run a lightweight worker itself if it has the resources to spare though
2011-03-10T13:13:19  <janzert> in the current case where the manager and website are one machine, I'd rather not run games on it
2011-03-10T13:13:21  <jmcarthur> but iirc the main was always slow and overloaded anyway, right?
2011-03-10T13:13:26  <janzert> yes
2011-03-10T13:13:46  <janzert> it also means we don't have to install all the different languages on the main server

2011-03-10T13:34:43  <McLeopold> antimatroid: okay, I think he just didn't understand what the code did
2011-03-10T13:35:07  <McLeopold> I was marking any square as conflict if an ant died there, collision or attack
2011-03-10T13:35:25  <McLeopold> if any other ant moved to that spot, then they died of a collision
2011-03-10T13:35:48  <McLeopold> of course, that would have happened before attacks...
2011-03-10T13:36:19  <McLeopold> The resolve_orders method was named badly, it should have been called "cleanup_state"
2011-03-10T13:36:55  <antimatroid> McLeopold: what happens if you move into a square containing an ant that hasn't moved out of it yet, but will by the end of the turn?
2011-03-10T13:37:55  <McLeopold> I was maintaining a separate list of destinations
2011-03-10T13:38:32  <antimatroid> ahh, okay
2011-03-10T13:39:41  <McLeopold> I was processing 1 bot at a time, but the list of conflicts and marking the map square as conflict allowed me to detect enemy ants colliding
2011-03-10T13:39:57  <McLeopold> If we ever lower the attack radius or use another attack resolution

2011-03-10T13:53:26  <McLeopold> antimatroid: we talked about if friendly ants collide, then any nearby enemy gets the points
2011-03-10T13:54:10  <McLeopold> Any bot that wants to strategically suicide will be able to do so before the enemy is close, so it would actually not be worth the effort to code that.
2011-03-10T13:55:01  <McLeopold> so, at this point, only if the ants are from different bots do points get handed out, so kinda like range 0
2011-03-10T13:56:00  <antimatroid> i didn't realise any score was assigned for colliding enemies?
2011-03-10T13:56:14  <jmcarthur> with capture the flag we would also need to change all the starters in addition to the engine
2011-03-10T13:56:20  <jmcarthur> not that we can't but it's more to do
2011-03-10T13:56:25  <antimatroid> do they scores just go to the enemies also colliding with it? or any ants in range of the colliding square at the end of moves?
2011-03-10T13:56:47  <jmcarthur> that said, i love capture the flag
2011-03-10T13:57:15  <jmcarthur> could be that you get a point every time you capture a flag and lose a point every time your flag is captured

2011-03-10T13:58:08  <antimatroid> but that was "too complicated"
2011-03-10T13:58:15  <jmcarthur> well
2011-03-10T13:59:03  <jmcarthur> i don't have an argument about whether it's too complicated generally, but i think we shouldn't put too much effort into something not relating directly to the goal of the game
2011-03-10T13:59:20  <jmcarthur> if the point is to spawn lots of ants, then yeah i think that would be a decent design choice

2011-03-10T14:02:24  <McLeopold> You have to balance your fighter/spawner ratio
2011-03-10T14:02:30  <jmcarthur> you get to choose?

2011-03-10T14:02:36  <McLeopold> Yes
2011-03-10T14:02:53  <McLeopold> only spawners can turn food into ants, their choice of which kind
2011-03-10T14:03:01  <McLeopold> only fighters can kill ants
2011-03-10T14:03:30  <UncleVasya> And don't forget Ms. Qeen. :)
2011-03-10T14:03:48  <McLeopold> it gives me that "to attack a neutral planet or not to attack a neutral planet" feeling.
2011-03-10T14:04:20  <jmcarthur> so spawning becomes an explicit action. does that also imply that for consistency fighting should too?
2011-03-10T14:04:31  <McLeopold> plus it is still "easier" than using a more complex battle option
2011-03-10T14:04:52  <McLeopold> no, spawning become a "bot" action, not an "ant" action

2011-03-10T14:05:00  <jmcarthur> explicit fight commands would alleviate this controversial battle stuff altogther
2011-03-10T14:05:04  <jmcarthur> *altogether
2011-03-10T14:05:23  <jmcarthur> i don't understand what you mean by it being a "bot" action
2011-03-10T14:05:30  <jmcarthur> the bot still has to say which spawn should be which ant
2011-03-10T14:05:32  <McLeopold> you get a new ant at a position, and it can't move until you declare it's type
2011-03-10T14:05:45  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-10T14:05:52  <McLeopold> but your not giving an ant an order to spawn something
2011-03-10T14:06:27  <antimatroid> why even have a type of ant?
2011-03-10T14:06:39  <McLeopold> read the logs ^^
2011-03-10T14:06:47  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: to provide incentive to not spread out completely
2011-03-10T14:07:02  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: (to work out the limitations of option 2)

2011-03-10T14:07:13  <McLeopold> well, you still want to spread
2011-03-10T14:07:22  <McLeopold> just with a correct ratio
2011-03-10T14:07:24  <jmcarthur> yes, but it's tougher to do it well
2011-03-10T14:07:30  <McLeopold> right
2011-03-10T14:07:47  <jmcarthur> it at least requires some intelligent allocation instead of just an explosion of ants all over the map

2011-03-10T14:08:59  <antimatroid> i can't imagine this counting as simple enough
2011-03-10T14:09:19  <McLeopold> simple as in you can watch a game and understand
2011-03-10T14:09:21  <antimatroid> i don't really see how it provides an incentive not to spread out either
2011-03-10T14:09:27  <McLeopold> not simple as in easy to code
2011-03-10T14:09:53  <McLeopold> battle option 1 is easy to code, but hard to watch a game and understand what is happening
2011-03-10T14:10:09  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it's not really that. it's just incentive to do *something* less brainless than just spreading out
2011-03-10T14:10:10  <antimatroid> battle option 1 is so awesome i don't understand the hate D:
2011-03-10T14:10:17  <antimatroid> it makes the game in itself
2011-03-10T14:10:27  <jmcarthur> you still need objective
2011-03-10T14:10:36  <jmcarthur> i think battle option 1 would work well with capture the flag
2011-03-10T14:10:40  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: it would be good if there was an actual balance to spreading out
2011-03-10T14:10:51  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: yeah, option 1 is one such balance
2011-03-10T14:11:28  <antimatroid> how far away are we from actually watching games again?
2011-03-10T14:11:40  <antimatroid> we can't be that far off being able to try out some different game parameters?
2011-03-10T14:12:06  <McLeopold> the engine has always worked
2011-03-10T14:12:13  <McLeopold> you can watch games now
2011-03-10T14:12:39  <antimatroid> does the visualiser pass the input?
2011-03-10T14:12:45  <antimatroid> i should try and get the engine running
2011-03-10T14:13:03  <McLeopold> you can use my viewer, I'm not sure how hooked up Frontier's is

2011-03-10T14:38:55  <McLeopold> I'm quite happy with Win7.  You just need to know your tools.
2011-03-10T14:38:55  <jmcarthur> they tell you

2011-03-10T14:40:49  <antimatroid> it does
2011-03-10T14:42:24  <McLeopold> so, after you add a folder to your path, you need to open up a command window again, assuming that's where you are
2011-03-10T14:42:38  <antimatroid> it was always there
2011-03-10T14:42:53  <McLeopold> but you type python and get nothing?

2011-03-10T19:58:39  <sigh> format time?
2011-03-10T19:59:10  <antimatroid> my system is a mess, it's been needed for a while
2011-03-10T19:59:14  <antimatroid> i'm finally formatting
2011-03-10T19:59:34  <antimatroid> i'm only putting xp on again for the moment, i'll try to find a spare drive and put ubunutu on it
2011-03-10T20:01:11  <jmcarthur> bss03: sorry, distractions
2011-03-10T20:01:31  <jmcarthur> bss03: i've stuck what i have so far on the rewrite on darcsden. i just replaces the old repo with it
2011-03-10T20:01:34  <jmcarthur> *replaced
2011-03-10T20:01:50  <antimatroid> sigh: did you talk to McLeopold at all today
2011-03-10T20:01:58  <sigh> nope
2011-03-10T20:02:00  <antimatroid> he doesn't think there was any issues with conflicts
2011-03-10T20:02:02  <sigh> ping McLeopold
2011-03-10T20:02:04  <antimatroid> possibly badly named functions
2011-03-10T20:02:28  <sigh> badly named functions by me?
2011-03-10T20:02:31  <jmcarthur> bss03: i just blew away all my SPECIALIZE pragmas and stuff because i split it up a bit more, so it's slower than it was earlier, but that should be easy to get back. there's also some extra functionality yet to add, like a timer, and i also want to make some more accessors and stuff like distance function and junk
2011-03-10T20:02:33  <antimatroid> by him
2011-03-10T20:02:46  <jmcarthur> bss03: anyway, i've gotta go
2011-03-10T20:02:49  <bss03> Kk.
2011-03-10T20:02:53  <bss03> Thanks for the update.
2011-03-10T20:03:02  <jmcarthur> bss03: http://darcsden.com/jmcarthur/ants-bot
2011-03-10T20:03:06  <antimatroid> basically he was marking a square as occupied once an ant moved there, then killing conflicts as they occured, i think?
2011-03-10T20:03:12  <jmcarthur> there's no example included in that yet either, sadly
2011-03-10T20:03:21  <jmcarthur> but i have one sitting around that i can't get to right now
2011-03-10T20:03:24  <jmcarthur> i'll be back later
2011-03-10T20:03:34  <sigh> antimatroid: yes, but that doesn't help when it conflicts with an ant that has yet to move
2011-03-10T20:03:43  <bss03> I'll be around for about 3 more hours.
2011-03-10T20:03:50  <antimatroid> sigh: it should still be marked as occupied yeah?
2011-03-10T20:04:08  <McLeopold> sigh: pong
2011-03-10T20:04:14  <antimatroid> there we go
2011-03-10T20:04:20  <sigh> anyway, I've changed the code for other reasons, so it's a moot point :)
2011-03-10T20:04:39  <antimatroid> McLeopold: when you removed 2 ants that collided, the square was still marked as occupied yeah?
2011-03-10T20:05:00  <McLeopold> uh, let me check
2011-03-10T20:05:07  <sigh> McLeopold: I centralised all the management of ants either way, so that keeping track of history is easy
2011-03-10T20:05:16  <antimatroid> yeah, i don't think it matters now
2011-03-10T20:07:39  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes
2011-03-10T20:07:55  <McLeopold> so if others moved there, they would still die
2011-03-10T20:08:41  <sigh> McLeopold: anyway, I'm still working on the replay but could you review the AntStore stuff? it should be stable now https://github.com/sigh/aichallenge/blob/replay/ants/ants.py
2011-03-10T20:09:01  <sigh> all the add/kill/move of ants is controlled by that class now
2011-03-10T20:09:07  <McLeopold> I did look at it.  I'm leaning toward not having the ant store class
2011-03-10T20:09:41  <sigh> fairly simple to take it out, but any reason why not?
2011-03-10T20:09:51  * amstan_ is amazed to look at the impact graph: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/graphs/impact
2011-03-10T20:09:59  <amstan_> look at all the colours!
2011-03-10T20:10:35  <McLeopold> sigh: it makes it more complex with no benefit
2011-03-10T20:11:41  <sigh> McLeopold: it means that different parts of the code don't have to all know how to kill or add an ant
2011-03-10T20:11:46  <McLeopold> also, it looked like I confused  you with my "resolve_orders" function name
2011-03-10T20:13:45  <sigh> ah, it did at first, then I coopted it to a different place :)
2011-03-10T20:15:05  <sigh> point is, now there is a lot more info to be updated, because there is the list of current ants, the list of all ants that have been created, list of killed ants... keeping them in a class just keeps things consistant

2011-03-10T20:16:46  <sigh> did you look at the version I have up now? it's actually quite simple now, and certainly simpler than the one I had up when I messaged you yesterday
2011-03-10T20:16:56  <McLeopold> I'll need to review it.
2011-03-10T20:17:04  <McLeopold> so, here's my thoughts on it...
2011-03-10T20:17:21  <McLeopold> I want something that people can look at and understand how the game works.

2011-03-10T20:17:51  <McLeopold> That's why I was trying to keep each part in a separate function, do_attack, do_spawn, etc...
2011-03-10T20:18:24  <sigh> Sure, I think this helps that
2011-03-10T20:18:46  <sigh> the only game logic in the class is the resolve_moves function, which you an move back into Ants
2011-03-10T20:18:53  <sigh> if that's the issue
2011-03-10T20:18:56  <McLeopold> okay, if it stays easy to understand, so others can implement their own engine, then it is good
2011-03-10T20:19:39  <McLeopold> the resolve_orders function was really to cleanup all the conflict flags in the map
2011-03-10T20:19:47  <McLeopold> it didn't actually resolve_orders
2011-03-10T20:20:03  <sigh> :)
2011-03-10T20:20:11  <sigh> I don't need the conflict flags anymore
2011-03-10T20:20:31  <sigh> I think that makes it clearer, now there is an explict list of killed ants
2011-03-10T20:20:41  <McLeopold> it was just a flag to be used while resolving orders, and to be cleared to land after the next state was sent
2011-03-10T20:21:05  <sigh> yes, and it was also used to mark dead ants in later parts of the game
2011-03-10T20:21:31  <McLeopold> yes, and there was a list of dead ants already
2011-03-10T20:21:33  <sigh> *later parts of the turn

2011-03-10T23:45:28  <sigh> I am
2011-03-10T23:45:37  <sigh> I got rid of AntStore for you :P
2011-03-10T23:45:45  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-03-10T23:45:49  <McLeopold> but...
2011-03-10T23:46:06  <McLeopold> you might have convinced me it was good
2011-03-10T23:46:10  <sigh> haha
2011-03-10T23:46:17  <McLeopold> I now feel bad for all the work you are doing
2011-03-10T23:46:45  <sigh> nah, I don't mind... I like working out the design of code
2011-03-10T23:46:49  <antimatroid> McLeopold: my command line recognises python now
2011-03-10T23:47:08  <antimatroid> format fixes all
2011-03-10T23:47:13  <sigh> one thing I like about it now is that the ant data and the map data are updated in the same function
2011-03-10T23:47:17  <sigh> which was not the case before
2011-03-10T23:47:40  <McLeopold> yes, that is good
2011-03-10T23:47:57  <sigh> either way, I'm not sorry that I implemented AntStore as it helped me put everything into one place
2011-03-10T23:48:40  <McLeopold> I'm usually against creating classes or object, unless there is a good reason.  At least in python.
2011-03-10T23:49:02  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I think I turned my map generator into a class :P
2011-03-10T23:49:15  <antimatroid> i was contemplating doing the same with the map analyzer?
2011-03-10T23:49:15  <sigh> personally I don't like having really large classes :P
2011-03-10T23:49:54  <sigh> having stuff separated out makes it easier to reason about, because you have a better idea where things can change
2011-03-10T23:50:32  <McLeopold> I find the opposite.  Having to follow to many rabbit trails makes code confusing for me.
2011-03-10T23:50:55  <McLeopold> The Ant class was just on the line of being too big.
2011-03-10T23:51:15  <antimatroid> i'm with mcleopold there
2011-03-10T23:51:33  <sigh> well, it is required for keeping all the data together... you could make a case for taking the move method out
2011-03-10T23:51:35  <antimatroid> i'd rather a big chunk to do something rather than a bunch of different chunks i need to pull up
2011-03-10T23:51:40  <sigh> I'mnot strongly for or against
2011-03-10T23:52:13  <McLeopold> I think the ant lists and map data structures should be tied together, as if it was just one complex data structure
2011-03-10T23:52:25  <McLeopold> the ant lists where originally just a speed up
2011-03-10T23:52:36  <McLeopold> I wanted just a matrix to be able to calculate everything
2011-03-10T23:53:10  <sigh> McLeopold: I agree that ants/map/food should be a single object
2011-03-10T23:53:41  <sigh> which is another reason I got rid of AntStore, ants are too tightly coupled with the map for a seperate store to make sense
2011-03-10T23:54:04  <McLeopold> But you still have an Ant class?
2011-03-10T23:54:35  <sigh> Ant is just a container, no different to having a tuple or a dictionary of values
2011-03-10T23:55:44  <McLeopold> except you have a move method
2011-03-10T23:56:10  <McLeopold> or, is that just for tracking?
2011-03-10T23:56:32  <sigh> sure, but the move method contains no game logic
2011-03-10T23:56:50  <sigh> and it only serves to keeps its internal state consistent
2011-03-10T23:57:00  <McLeopold> ok
2011-03-10T23:57:12  <sigh> all the logic about moving an Ant is in the Ants class
2011-03-10T23:57:26  <sigh> in the resolve_orders and do_orders methods
2011-03-10T23:57:33  <McLeopold> If we did need to cut down the Ants class, I would say try and move the map data structure, including lists out to a State class.
2011-03-10T23:57:46  <McLeopold> crap, you kept resolve_orders?
2011-03-10T23:57:55  <sigh> it does something different now
2011-03-10T23:58:25  <sigh> resolve_orders is called at the *start* of finish_turn to sort out the conflicts
2011-03-10T23:58:46  <sigh> it resolves the conflicts, so I think the name is appropriate
2011-03-10T23:58:52  <McLeopold> oh, so I guess you made it actually resolve orders then :)
2011-03-10T23:59:04  <sigh> :)
2011-03-10T23:59:20  <McLeopold> does all the "common game" functions make sense?  My plan is that any contest will use that framework.
2011-03-10T23:59:40  <sigh> which functions?
2011-03-10T23:59:46  <McLeopold> If python had true implementation classes, I would do that.
