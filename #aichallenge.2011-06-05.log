2011-06-05T07:50:11  <antimatroid> i ask anyone that :P
2011-06-05T07:50:12  <antimatroid> but go on...
2011-06-05T07:50:56  <smiley1983> A little, but my current thoughts are unimplemented, pending completion / extension of certain functions and data structures
2011-06-05T07:51:27  <antimatroid> yeah, i haven't implemented anything fighting wise, but i'm still curious about thoughts on it
2011-06-05T07:51:49  <antimatroid> once my exams are over and i've fixed up maps i'll try to churn out a semi-decent bot and then call it a day with ants
2011-06-05T07:51:52  <smiley1983> I've done some of the obvious searching for bad moves, good moves, and adjusting accordingly
2011-06-05T07:51:53  <antimatroid> i don't have a lot of time this year
2011-06-05T07:52:02  <antimatroid> how are you doing that?
2011-06-05T07:52:15  <antimatroid> are you checking for combinations of their ants moves? moving their ants first? or just assuming their ants don't move?
2011-06-05T07:52:48  <smiley1983> checking a few states generated based on different assumptions
2011-06-05T07:53:06  <smiley1983> one assumption is that the enemy doesn't move
2011-06-05T07:53:33  <smiley1983> one assumption is that the enemy tries to fill attack squares as aggressively as possible
2011-06-05T07:53:37  <antimatroid> how many ants are you checking moves for at a time? just one? if so how do you order the ants for making move selection? closest/furthest enemy?
2011-06-05T07:53:40  <smiley1983> but only looks at one such state
2011-06-05T07:53:45  <antimatroid> if you are doing multiple, are you doing them all or partitioning?
2011-06-05T07:54:04  <antimatroid> yeah, i think i'm pretty much planning those two assumptions
2011-06-05T07:54:12  <antimatroid> then maximise my minimum outcome
2011-06-05T07:54:33  <smiley1983> Whole map in one pass, but my "proposed orders" are cancelled recursively if they have bad outcomes
2011-06-05T07:54:56  <smiley1983> so that iteration has a sort of partitioning effect
2011-06-05T07:55:22  <antimatroid> have you thought much about macro strategy? ie. spreading out, maximising visibility/fastest access to squares, pairing up friend ants to enemy ants etc?
2011-06-05T07:55:29  <smiley1983> yes
2011-06-05T07:55:33  <smiley1983> a bit
2011-06-05T07:56:11  <smiley1983> all unimplemented
2011-06-05T07:56:28  <antimatroid> yeah i haven't implemented any of this stuff, i'm still just thinking about ideas
2011-06-05T07:56:52  <antimatroid> it would be awesome to make a bot that partitions "fight" ants and does full turn game trees, but we don't have enough time with the number of ants :(
2011-06-05T07:57:01  <smiley1983> I've been interested to see some different techniques in action on the beta server
2011-06-05T07:57:01  <antimatroid> it would be sweet to watch some games with such a bot though
2011-06-05T07:57:23  <antimatroid> are there some? i haven't watched any games in like a week or two
2011-06-05T07:58:02  <smiley1983> I'm not sure it would gain a huge benefit from it - some, but a better expansion system will still probably beat it without deep combat analysis
2011-06-05T07:58:24  <antimatroid> i'm pretty happy with my food collection
2011-06-05T07:58:30  <smiley1983> some expansion strategies can be seen
2011-06-05T07:58:34  <antimatroid> a few minor tweaks needed, but otherwise it's pretty solid
2011-06-05T07:58:46  <smiley1983> care to offer any thoughts on food collection?
2011-06-05T07:59:04  <antimatroid> i'll explain my basic food collection algorithm
2011-06-05T07:59:17  <smiley1983> :)
2011-06-05T08:00:54  <antimatroid> create an "available" map for the grid, setting current ant locations at 0 and non-ant locations at unavailable, then from the set of not yet collected food, iteratively do a bfs from all food locations at once to find the closest ant that can make it within the spawnradius of a food square, "move the ant", update the availability information at it's current square, target square and the food square, then collecting the
2011-06-05T08:01:13  <antimatroid> you can decide whether you want to collect food with enemy ants or not (this is a strategy preference)
2011-06-05T08:02:04  <antimatroid> you need to keep the bfs going until like currentDist >= bestDist + bestLocationAvailability
2011-06-05T08:02:47  <antimatroid> it's not optimal, but i don't see people getting much closer to optimal without a tree like structure
2011-06-05T08:03:01  <smiley1983> do you repeat the bfs after updating availability info?
2011-06-05T08:03:05  <antimatroid> yes
2011-06-05T08:03:16  <smiley1983> ah, I hadn't thought of that
2011-06-05T08:03:36  <antimatroid> it can take upwards of 200ms with lots of food and ants, but you can "call it off after x amount of time" if you want, and you will still have collected the closest food
2011-06-05T08:03:47  <smiley1983> yes
2011-06-05T08:04:32  <antimatroid> it collects food like 5-6 times faster than hunterbot
2011-06-05T08:04:42  <antimatroid> if there's lots of it
2011-06-05T08:04:55  <smiley1983> the one I have on the server is very silly
2011-06-05T08:05:27  <smiley1983> it sends every ant after its closest food, even if they all go after one
2011-06-05T08:06:26  <antimatroid> :P, you could at least stop going after each piece of food when you've gone for it :P
2011-06-05T08:06:30  <antimatroid> but mine even improves on that
2011-06-05T08:07:25  <smiley1983> No, it's just doing a bfs from food items, marking the distance, and the every ant steps to the tile with the smallest food distance
2011-06-05T08:07:53  <smiley1983> No point improving it, though, that code is obsolete :)
2011-06-05T08:09:34  <antimatroid> one question about mine is whether to use enemy ants while collecting food
2011-06-05T08:09:57  <antimatroid> assuming the enemy employs a similar strategy, you probably want to, otherwise it may work better to go after food items nearer to them first
2011-06-05T08:11:53  <smiley1983> it will be interesting to see how the food collection strategies develop wrt enemies
2011-06-05T08:12:08  <smiley1983> do they have a planned duration?
2011-06-05T08:12:28  <antimatroid> i think people have been pretty happy with my suggestion of 2 months
2011-06-05T08:12:41  <antimatroid> tron was too short and pw too long from the general consensus i think
2011-06-05T08:12:49  <antimatroid> so i've applied the goldy locks rules

2011-06-05T08:14:46  <smiley1983> as in multi-contest framework?
2011-06-05T08:14:51  <antimatroid> i think after ants we should say no more contests until zeta is up and running, then hopefully get servers up for old games and a few others
2011-06-05T08:14:58  <antimatroid> then once that is somewhat done do another contest
2011-06-05T08:14:59  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-06-05T08:16:39  <smiley1983> yes, I would love to develop a tron bot, and if pw were back I would return to it eventually... plus I know others who missed that contest and would like to develop a pw bot
2011-06-05T08:17:36  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm super keen to play around with tron again
2011-06-05T08:17:43  <antimatroid> you actually get to use a proper game tree
2011-06-05T08:18:20  <smiley1983> I've never actually implemented one before, so I'd like to
2011-06-05T08:18:24  <antimatroid> one of the harder problems with tron is longest path once you separate into regions
2011-06-05T08:18:43  <antimatroid> if we did it again, we'd have to do it multiplayer with some 2-player maps
2011-06-05T08:19:33  <antimatroid> and chambers can be tricky, but not too hard to do somewhat well
2011-06-05T08:19:42  <smiley1983> would it be hard to make that fair? (multiplayer tron)
2011-06-05T08:19:48  <antimatroid> that being, if you leave a chamber too early, you can't get back in to fill the space up
2011-06-05T08:19:56  <antimatroid> no, just do symmetric maps
2011-06-05T08:20:08  <antimatroid> i could use the ants maps i think
2011-06-05T08:20:25  <antimatroid> you'd want more open maps though
2011-06-05T08:20:34  <antimatroid> as the walls are created as the game progresses
2011-06-05T08:22:07  <smiley1983> I hope to see zeta running then. :) (responses becoming more intermittent, eating)

2011-06-05T13:26:54  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: it was a good while ago. basically it's a squad combat game with continuous time and continuous space where you issue all the orders for some duration of time, and then the game is advanced that amount of time. it keeps the simultaneous, turn-based play that we normally have in this contest but allows for continuous time and space games
2011-06-05T13:27:42  <antimatroid> ah yeah, would like
2011-06-05T13:27:49  <antimatroid> there's many types of ai games i would like to explore
2011-06-05T13:28:06  <antimatroid> hopefully with zeta we can put up some more advanced games that aren't actually run as an official contest
2011-06-05T13:29:33  <jmcarthur> my biggest fear about that is an overall lower number of bots submitted for each game, even officially supported games, due to people choosing other games
2011-06-05T13:30:01  <antimatroid> yep
2011-06-05T13:30:09  <antimatroid> i want it to be more of a training/learning center
2011-06-05T13:30:13  <jmcarthur> i'm not completely against the idea. i just don't know how badly my fears will come true
2011-06-05T13:30:27  <antimatroid> i don't think it would be too hard to spark interest with an official contest game once a year or so
2011-06-05T13:30:58  <antimatroid> it would also allow contest games to possibly be a bit more complicated
2011-06-05T13:31:06  <jmcarthur> yeah i think if we make it rare enough and loud enough then the official games should get a lot of attention
2011-06-05T13:31:09  <antimatroid> if people have servers they can play around with say tron and pw with first
2011-06-05T13:31:13  <antimatroid> build their way up
2011-06-05T13:31:39  <antimatroid> tron is the best starting ai game imo
2011-06-05T13:31:48  <mcstar> (sponsors sponsors and recruitment)
2011-06-05T13:31:48  <antimatroid> biased because it was mine, but it was so awesome
2011-06-05T13:32:07  <jmcarthur> i lubbed tron
2011-06-05T13:32:16  <antimatroid> lubed :P
2011-06-05T13:32:18  <jmcarthur> ew
2011-06-05T13:37:18  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: I think PW is easier to start than Tron because it is more intuitive. PW  can provide more ideas to implement for the bot before things turn into the mathematics.
2011-06-05T13:37:36  <antimatroid> erm?
2011-06-05T13:37:39  <antimatroid> did you compete in tron? :P
2011-06-05T13:37:43  <jmcarthur> i don't even see that argument
2011-06-05T13:37:57  <antimatroid> tron was fairly easy game tree search
2011-06-05T13:38:15  <antimatroid> with longest path once you separate, also doable with a decision tree i suspect
2011-06-05T13:38:22  <antimatroid> planet wars was a beast of a problem
2011-06-05T13:38:26  <jmcarthur> tron was a simpler game, required less math, was easier to visualize, was easier to improve upon, didn't require resorting to so much guesswork
2011-06-05T13:38:52  <jmcarthur> heck, each turn aside from the first only gave you three possible choices
2011-06-05T13:38:55  <jmcarthur> *up to

2011-06-05T13:44:16  <UncleVasya> I mean easier not to be best, but to get started. You say word "tree". From the very beginnig of the development bot for Tron contestant has to think about it. While in PW before contestant will need it he can implement some intuitive scripting things like "go to front", "snipe neutrals", "defend planets" etc. When he realize that scripting sucks he will start thinking about building some trees.
2011-06-05T13:45:02  <UncleVasya> But maybe I didn't understand what you mean by "best starting ai-game".

2011-06-05T13:49:32  <jmcarthur> you don't need a game tree just to get started with tron
2011-06-05T13:49:48  <jmcarthur> all you need for tron is up, down, left, or right
2011-06-05T13:50:27  <jmcarthur> i think what you mean is that PW has more stuff to obscure the tree, which IMO makes it harder rather than easier

2011-06-05T13:52:32  <jmcarthur> "best starting ai game" to me means that the game is easy to learn, easy to improve with, hard to master, and encourages you to survey a lot of prior research into similar games while still encouraging creativity on your own
2011-06-05T13:53:07  <jmcarthur> tron was all of that, to me, but PW lacked all that except for being hard to master and encouraging creativity
2011-06-05T13:54:41  <jmcarthur> my prediction for ants is that it's somewhere between tron and PW as far as ease of learning, harder to improve upon and master than both, between them on research, and about on par with PW on creativity
2011-06-05T13:55:42  <jmcarthur> huh, that makes it sound like i like ants more than PW, but that's not really the case...
2011-06-05T13:55:54  <jmcarthur> maybe i need to add something else to my criteria

2011-06-05T14:39:02  <bhasker> morning
2011-06-05T14:40:20  <bhasker> i think ants has less strategy than planetwars frankly
2011-06-05T14:40:35  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-06-05T14:40:54  <bhasker> my logic with ants is already at a point where i doubt i will improve it much further
2011-06-05T14:40:59  <bhasker> combat is too simplistic
2011-06-05T14:41:09  <bhasker> unless someone can really work out formations very well
2011-06-05T14:41:13  <bhasker> i doubt most bots will get better
2011-06-05T14:42:01  <bhasker> and mostly the problem seems to be due to one guy growing exponentially
2011-06-05T14:42:07  <bhasker> if you are lucky and get a weak neighbour
2011-06-05T14:42:09  <bhasker> that bot is bound to win
2011-06-05T14:42:11  <bhasker> pretty much
2011-06-05T14:42:17  <bhasker> as long as it doesn't do something stupid
2011-06-05T14:42:41  <bhasker> maybe restricting ants to a max of 4 players would be better
2011-06-05T14:42:45  <bhasker> 7-10 player games are too random
2011-06-05T14:42:56  <bhasker> and i really doubt they add more value to the skill rating
2011-06-05T14:43:28  <bhasker> a mediocre bot could easily bot a superior bot if it got enough growth and territory control
2011-06-05T14:43:39  <bhasker> due to its neighbours being crappy
2011-06-05T14:43:46  <bhasker> easily beat*
2011-06-05T14:46:25  <bhasker> also planetwars had some really interesting bots to watch, like mcleopolds ant bot/scotbot, etc and the formations were cool
2011-06-05T14:46:30  <bhasker> ants somehow seems to lame to watch

2011-06-05T14:54:21  <olexs> maybe worker that gets a compile job stops showing on statistics because it can't play games

2011-06-05T14:54:39  <bhasker> weird that trueskill levels are not climbing anymore
2011-06-05T14:54:49  <bhasker> seem to be stuck in the low 40's high 30's from the top bots
2011-06-05T14:54:53  <olexs> they are sinking the whole time, something isn't quite right imho
2011-06-05T14:55:20  <olexs> before my bot got any good, sir_macelon was >50
2011-06-05T14:55:34  <bhasker> heh yea
2011-06-05T14:55:48  <bhasker> but it could be that most top bots are beating each other on different maps
2011-06-05T14:55:51  <olexs> but I like how it's c
2011-06-05T14:55:57  <olexs> c++ on the top
2011-06-05T14:55:59  <bhasker> so its compressing them down to the same range
2011-06-05T14:56:05  <olexs> maybe
2011-06-05T14:56:08  <bhasker> i guess a lot of good folks don't have bots yet
2011-06-05T14:56:12  <bhasker> that will change soon:)
2011-06-05T14:56:29  <antimatroid> bhasker: is a1k0n going to compete?
2011-06-05T14:56:30  <olexs> well, it also says one should not upload the good bots into the beta for security reasons and such :)
2011-06-05T14:56:45  <bhasker> no idea, he was planning on writing a bot for ants but don't know if he got to it
2011-06-05T14:56:56  <antimatroid> fair enough
2011-06-05T14:57:04  <antimatroid> anyway, i'm crawling into bed for a few hours, night
2011-06-05T14:57:28  <bhasker> i guess so, but frankly unless someone has a top secret bot, most of the ones right now seem to be very similar
2011-06-05T14:57:44  <bhasker> grab food, run when you can't win, grab more food, fight when you can't do anything else
2011-06-05T14:57:45  <antimatroid> i can't imagine people have done much for fighting?
2011-06-05T14:57:53  <antimatroid> that's really where i expect the "goodness" to come from with bots
2011-06-05T14:57:58  <bhasker> fighting is mostly restricted to i think don't enter combat if you die
2011-06-05T14:58:07  <bhasker> frankly i think fighting is too simplistic
2011-06-05T14:58:08  <bhasker> right now
2011-06-05T14:58:18  <bhasker> i don't see much strategy happening in fighting
2011-06-05T14:58:33  <antimatroid> a bigger fight radius could make fighting better
2011-06-05T14:58:42  <bhasker> i would expect more strategy to come from controlling territory
2011-06-05T14:58:46  <bhasker> rather than the actual fights themselves
2011-06-05T14:58:56  <bhasker> how to position ants to increase ability to gather food
2011-06-05T14:59:02  <bhasker> thats what would decide most games
2011-06-05T14:59:36  <bhasker> actually 2 things a) fast initial growth b) territory control
2011-06-05T14:59:39  <bhasker> that would be key
2011-06-05T14:59:56  <bhasker> fighting is pretty much don't be stupid and walk in to a square where it will put you in range of 2 ants
2011-06-05T15:00:00  <bhasker> compared to yours one
2011-06-05T15:00:38  <amstan> you could tell where food spawned even if it's outside your fog of war if we implement proper symmetric food
2011-06-05T15:00:59  <bhasker> i think start of food spawn should be symmetric
2011-06-05T15:01:03  <bhasker> after that it should be random
2011-06-05T15:01:13  <amstan> bhasker: define start
2011-06-05T15:01:13  <bhasker> only the starting food spawn needs to be symmetric
2011-06-05T15:01:19  <bhasker> first turn
2011-06-05T15:01:21  <bhasker> food spawning
2011-06-05T15:01:28  <bhasker> after that its better to be random
2011-06-05T15:01:39  <bhasker> or maybe the first 5-10 turns
2011-06-05T15:01:56  <bhasker> so that no bot has a weird start advantage due to asymmetric food spawns
2011-06-05T15:02:13  <bhasker> but after that random will prevent bots from guessing food locations based on initial conditions
2011-06-05T15:06:48  <UncleVasya> Why you are against guessing food locations? It coul be another problem to solve by bots.
2011-06-05T15:07:32  <bhasker> i guess i would rather have the bots do some exploration rather than just route to possible food locations straight up
2011-06-05T15:07:37  <bhasker> seems too much like cheating
2011-06-05T15:08:18  <bhasker> and it won't be that hard for most bots to do
2011-06-05T15:08:26  <bhasker> so most smart bots will just go from food location to food location
2011-06-05T15:08:52  <bhasker> it will be rather boring to watch frankly
2011-06-05T15:09:43  <bhasker> i think having a starting similarity surely helps to even the bots ,but beyond that random spawning actually tests the skill of the bot
2011-06-05T15:09:52  <bhasker> to be able to explore and keep control of its existing territory
2011-06-05T15:10:27  <bhasker> otherwise you will have bots that will do stuff like
2011-06-05T15:10:30  <bhasker> rushing

2011-06-05T15:10:54  <bhasker> if i know map is X by Y and there 7 players i can roughly calculate the rstart locations
2011-06-05T15:11:03  <bhasker> a bot could potentially just rush a couple of players with all their ants
2011-06-05T15:11:08  <bhasker> by knowing their start locations
2011-06-05T15:11:20  <bhasker> frankly i believe the bot should not be told how many players are there
2011-06-05T15:11:21  <bhasker> either
2011-06-05T15:11:32  <olexs> I dont think it is
2011-06-05T15:11:37  <bhasker> otherwise we will see rush strategies like the ones above

2011-06-05T15:12:29  <olexs> and there is no start param saying you the number of players afaik
2011-06-05T15:12:51  <bhasker> doesn't it send you the scores?

2011-06-05T15:13:02  <olexs> after the game is over
2011-06-05T15:13:02  <bhasker> or is it at the end
2011-06-05T15:13:04  <bhasker> ah
2011-06-05T15:13:31  <bhasker> also i think the same map should not be used with same number of players every time
2011-06-05T15:13:41  <bhasker> each map should support 2-max players
2011-06-05T15:13:47  <bhasker> and each game should pick a different # of players
2011-06-05T15:13:51  <bhasker> even on the same map
2011-06-05T15:14:34  <bhasker> would give some interesting variations
2011-06-05T15:15:02  <bhasker> also will the matching algorithm match similar players?
2011-06-05T15:15:26  <UncleVasya> Ithink so about 2-max players on map too.
2011-06-05T15:29:02  <berak> it makes a great difference ( think score ) if you encounter opponents in turn 20 (small map lots of players), or in turn 100(big map, less players ). i think the curent scheme(numplayers proportianal to mapsize) gives more fairness in terms of score/skill, and leads to less oscillating rankings

2011-06-05T21:40:10  <amstan_> yes, still doesn't take too much, compared to the bots
2011-06-05T21:40:14  <okayzed> oh, interesting
2011-06-05T21:40:24  <okayzed> what's the range on game length?
2011-06-05T21:40:39  <amstan_> i think we used 2000 lately
2011-06-05T21:43:10  <okayzed> very cool

2011-06-05T23:14:04  <amstan> McLeopold: hey
2011-06-05T23:14:24  <amstan> what do you think about that designer?
2011-06-05T23:14:44  <amstan> i just wanted to emphasize that we don't really have to use it for the website, we can use his stuff in another form
2011-06-05T23:15:24  <amstan> also, he can make more things, we don't have to limit ourselves to that folder
2011-06-05T23:21:39  <McLeopold> I like it
2011-06-05T23:21:53  <McLeopold> I depends on how "professional" we want this to look.
2011-06-05T23:22:13  <McLeopold> amstan: I'm worried about the TrueSkill calculations.  They seem to be off.
2011-06-05T23:22:45  <amstan> we should have found this out earlier
2011-06-05T23:23:29  <amstan> off how?
2011-06-05T23:23:51  <antimatroid> amstan: couldn't have really been tested earlier :P
2011-06-05T23:24:45  <McLeopold> no, it couldn't have been
2011-06-05T23:25:15  <amstan> so what's wrong?
2011-06-05T23:25:16  <McLeopold> with some numbers, the sigma goes up instead of down, which is different from the MS online calculator
2011-06-05T23:25:49  <amstan> sigma's the score right? mu's the accuracy
2011-06-05T23:26:25  <McLeopold> no, other way
2011-06-05T23:26:47  <McLeopold> sigma should always go down, never up, meaning we are always getting more accurate
2011-06-05T23:26:57  <amstan> shouldn't the sigma decrease linearly as the number of games increases?
2011-06-05T23:27:18  <McLeopold> not linear
2011-06-05T23:27:24  <amstan> ok, still
2011-06-05T23:27:29  <amstan> it should always decrease
2011-06-05T23:27:34  <McLeopold> the first games matter most, and it also depends on if the match was an upset or not
2011-06-05T23:27:39  <McLeopold> yes, always decrease
2011-06-05T23:27:50  <McLeopold> I think we should try this implementation https://github.com/nsp/JSkills

2011-06-05T23:28:02  <McLeopold> To see if it is more accurate
2011-06-05T23:28:20  <amstan> but this is sigma, isn't this the less complicated part?
2011-06-05T23:28:48  <McLeopold> Well, they are tied together.  If one is wrong, so is the other.
2011-06-05T23:29:16  <McLeopold> also, I think the fact that there are no skill levels above 50 means something is off
2011-06-05T23:29:33  <McLeopold> I can adjust the draw margine to 0 maybe
2011-06-05T23:30:07  <McLeopold> Let's try that and see what happens...
2011-06-05T23:31:02  <McLeopold> amstan: any objections before I update the db?
2011-06-05T23:31:03  <amstan> McLeopold: find the case where this happens, it should only take an if statment in update_trueskill
2011-06-05T23:31:22  <McLeopold> I don't follow you
2011-06-05T23:31:45  <amstan> McLeopold: you're saying sigma sometimes gets bigger after update_truskill()
2011-06-05T23:31:50  <McLeopold> You want me to log updates that cause sigma to rise?
2011-06-05T23:31:51  <amstan> where it should always go down
2011-06-05T23:32:01  <amstan> yes
2011-06-05T23:32:04  <McLeopold> ok
2011-06-05T23:32:25  <McLeopold> I'm also going to drop the draw margin and reset the beta bots, is that ok?
2011-06-05T23:32:43  <amstan> "reset the beta bots"?
2011-06-05T23:32:53  <McLeopold> back to 50/16.666
2011-06-05T23:32:57  <amstan> sure
2011-06-05T23:34:32  <amstan> McLeopold: i don't really want to switch the libraries, the other one is java
2011-06-05T23:35:00  <amstan> if we find a bug with this one, we should find the case where it fails(and microsoft's works), maybe send a bug report to the creator
2011-06-05T23:35:09  <McLeopold> I want to at least know if our implementation is flawed
2011-06-05T23:35:21  <amstan> that logging should find it
2011-06-05T23:35:30  <McLeopold> but it won't fix it
2011-06-05T23:35:40  <McLeopold> nor explain what the problem is
2011-06-05T23:35:45  <amstan> no, but then we know it's the library's fault and not us
2011-06-05T23:39:04  <McLeopold> amstan: I don't need to log, we can query the database
2011-06-05T23:40:53  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, but what will that give us? we want the changes, not the final values
2011-06-05T23:41:03  <McLeopold> the changes are there

2011-06-05T23:41:42  <amstan> ok
2011-06-05T23:42:12  <McLeopold> that's enough info to put in the online calculator to check
2011-06-05T23:42:26  <amstan> then you could use manager/trueskill/sample.py to test them

2011-06-05T23:45:43  <janzert1> McLeopold: manager/create_matchups.py is no longer used and its functionality is completely re-implemented in other ways now right?
2011-06-05T23:46:19  <McLeopold> except for the pairing cutoff, yes
2011-06-05T23:46:39  <McLeopold> But we would need to put that in the stored procedure anyway
2011-06-05T23:47:27  <janzert1> ok, pairing cutoff can be done later anyway and there are enough other reminders about it for it not to be forgotten about it
2011-06-05T23:47:43  <McLeopold> I'll make an issue in github
