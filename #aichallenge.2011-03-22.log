2011-03-22T00:09:50  <antimatroid> you can block 2 width corridors with sqrt(6)
2011-03-22T00:11:46  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Battle-Resolution-Options
2011-03-22T00:11:49  <antimatroid> see example 4

2011-03-22T00:21:53  <antimatroid> more examples are there
2011-03-22T00:22:21  <antimatroid> janzert: there's quite a few examples where power and damage differ
2011-03-22T00:22:44  <janzert> yes
2011-03-22T00:23:37  <janzert> I wonder does it require three teams to make them differ?
2011-03-22T00:23:47  <janzert> my first guess is it does
2011-03-22T00:24:09  <janzert> and then I see example 10 :P
2011-03-22T00:24:13  <janzert> so nevermind
2011-03-22T00:24:23  <antimatroid> :p
2011-03-22T00:25:23  <antimatroid> is 1 damage where you live if you have less damage than one of your enemies?
2011-03-22T00:25:40  <antimatroid> is power damage where*
2011-03-22T00:26:13  <antimatroid> i think that might be right
2011-03-22T00:26:20  <janzert> I think so

2011-03-22T00:26:39  <antimatroid> thatn all of your enemies**
2011-03-22T00:26:55  <janzert> have you tried blocking 3 or 4 wide corridors with sqrt(6)?
2011-03-22T00:27:01  <janzert> right
2011-03-22T00:27:05  <antimatroid> yeah, pretty sure you can't block 3 fully
2011-03-22T00:27:09  <antimatroid> but you can do a good job
2011-03-22T00:27:14  <antimatroid> did i give those examples?
2011-03-22T00:27:16  <janzert> or "than each of"
2011-03-22T00:27:44  <janzert> 6 is one 3 wide example
2011-03-22T00:27:52  <antimatroid> 5 is repeated 4
2011-03-22T00:27:53  <antimatroid> my bad
2011-03-22T00:29:14  <antimatroid> check example 5 now
2011-03-22T00:29:38  <antimatroid> it's blockable with support
2011-03-22T00:29:49  <janzert> ahh, so you can trade 3 for 1
2011-03-22T00:30:04  <antimatroid> what?
2011-03-22T00:30:07  <antimatroid> oh yeah
2011-03-22T00:30:08  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-22T00:30:21  <antimatroid> then if you come in right after and they run out, you can diminish them
2011-03-22T00:30:29  <antimatroid> but the can also set up a nice block temporarily
2011-03-22T00:30:38  <antimatroid> i don't mind that, i just don't want full blocking
2011-03-22T00:30:49  <janzert> yeah, it's probably ok
2011-03-22T00:31:17  <janzert> too bad we have to keep all corridors 3 wide
2011-03-22T00:31:48  <antimatroid> 2*
2011-03-22T00:31:57  <antimatroid> oh err
2011-03-22T00:32:06  <antimatroid> we could change the attack radius back to 2
2011-03-22T00:34:33  <janzert> hmm, I think I'd like it better but why was it increased?
2011-03-22T00:36:07  <antimatroid> mcleopold wanted a larger one
2011-03-22T00:38:39  <antimatroid> i think i should restate power/occupied as damage 1 and damage 2
2011-03-22T00:38:49  <antimatroid> sigh: ^^?
2011-03-22T00:39:06  <sigh> antimatroid: no
2011-03-22T00:39:11  <antimatroid> but they're so close
2011-03-22T00:39:15  <sigh> power is power, not damage
2011-03-22T00:39:34  <antimatroid> it's damage with you live if you have less damage than any of your enemies in range
2011-03-22T00:39:55  <sigh> meh, I don't think it makes sense, but I'm too busy to argue
2011-03-22T00:40:09  <antimatroid> i'll leave it for the moment

2011-03-22T00:48:38  <amstan> antimatroid: it's in there
2011-03-22T00:48:41  <janzert> hmm, so even with attack radius of 2, 2 wide corridors can still be blocked?
2011-03-22T00:49:45  <janzert> battle_sim.py 4 <<<"%bb%|a..a|.aa."
2011-03-22T00:50:31  <janzert> so reducing it doesn't help
2011-03-22T00:51:01  <antimatroid> hmmm yeah, you're right
2011-03-22T00:51:24  <antimatroid> so if blocking is a problem we need to carve maps with 3x3 blocks?
2011-03-22T00:51:56  <janzert> yes or at least ensure all areas are accessible with 3 wide corridors
2011-03-22T00:52:08  <antimatroid> can do that
2011-03-22T00:52:19  <antimatroid> just do the isvalid function with a 3x3 block
2011-03-22T00:52:33  <janzert> you could make "shortcuts" with narrower corridors that could then be blocked
2011-03-22T00:52:53  <antimatroid> that'd be harder to do right
2011-03-22T00:53:01  <janzert> yep :)
2011-03-22T00:53:50  <antimatroid> so... who doesn't prefer damage to the rest?
2011-03-22T01:01:32  <sigh> you guys realize that water squares don't affect the battle?
2011-03-22T01:01:48  <sigh> you keep making examples with water, which makes it hard to see the players :P
2011-03-22T01:02:35  <sigh> ^^ antimatroid, janzert
2011-03-22T01:02:56  <janzert> yes, I know they don't directly
2011-03-22T01:02:59  <antimatroid> sigh: the point is to show the water blocking places an ant could be
2011-03-22T01:03:15  <janzert> but I'm looking at what is possible in a corridor so... :)
2011-03-22T01:03:18  <sigh> :)

2011-03-22T03:46:56  <Stocha> If they was only two player per game, then one blockable corridor would be okay. As long as existis a path to either doors of the blockable corridor.
2011-03-22T03:47:25  <Stocha> that would allow to block for slowing down the opponent

2011-03-22T07:57:07  <sigh> let me see
2011-03-22T07:59:38  <sigh> why is turn-based is ambiguous
2011-03-22T07:59:51  <sigh> turn-based is ambiguous
2011-03-22T07:59:58  <sigh> I wasn't asking a question :P
2011-03-22T08:00:46  <sigh> remove "turn-based" it doesn't add much to the description
2011-03-22T08:00:51  <antimatroid> err.. because it might mean players make moves in turns? :P
2011-03-22T08:01:51  <sigh> I say remove it
2011-03-22T08:02:06  <antimatroid> done
2011-03-22T08:02:10  <sigh> also remove the stuff about how to get started, that just cluters up the specs
2011-03-22T08:05:14  <antimatroid> and done
2011-03-22T08:05:20  <sigh> also, can we have a toc on the game?

2011-03-22T08:07:05  <antimatroid> i wanted one in the past then gave up when i couldn't find an easy way to add one like in a latex document
2011-03-22T08:07:39  <sigh> ah, just googled... it seems it is a requested feature :P
2011-03-22T08:08:33  <antimatroid> i imagine it'll happen at some point, it's a pretty common want

2011-03-22T08:25:58  <antimatroid> it makes sense though
2011-03-22T08:26:23  <antimatroid> that is correct though
2011-03-22T08:27:02  <antimatroid> a1(1/2 + 1/3), b(1/2 + 1/3), c(1/2 + 1/3 + 1), a2(1/3)

2011-03-22T08:27:44  <antimatroid> ah yeah, just noticed :P sorry

2011-03-22T08:28:19  <antimatroid> but yeah, i think he's right that power method resolves better there

2011-03-22T08:29:17  <antimatroid> i ranked support as easiest to understand, put damage and iterated closest together, then noted pretty much everyone struggles to grasp power on their first go

2011-03-22T08:35:33  <sigh> the main issue should be blocking
2011-03-22T08:39:45  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-03-22T08:39:54  <antimatroid> i don't think blocking is that bad
2011-03-22T08:40:10  <antimatroid> if it becomes an issue, we just make sure a 3x3 block can reach every square inside the grid, problem solved
2011-03-22T08:40:36  <sigh> yeah
2011-03-22T08:41:17  <sigh> antimatroid: funny thing, I explained the methods to a guy at work and his first thought was that power was the most intuitive :P
2011-03-22T08:41:28  <sigh> or made the most sense
2011-03-22T08:41:32  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-22T08:41:54  <antimatroid> but was that for intuitive way of explaining fighting in general and he understood them all anyway?
2011-03-22T08:42:06  <antimatroid> i refer to intuitive in that fashion, but i suspect some others aren't
2011-03-22T08:42:48  <sigh> I just explained the methods and asked him what he thought made the most sense
2011-03-22T08:43:24  <antimatroid> sigh: i disagree with him on the last example
2011-03-22T08:43:59  <antimatroid> i think the damage outcome is better

2011-03-22T08:59:21  <Stocha> i mean ant killed if damage >=1 is pretty arbitrary. Maybe 1 is not the best value.

2011-03-22T09:06:43  <antimatroid> it's the obvious choice so that two ants coming across each other die

2011-03-22T09:08:06  <antimatroid> Stocha: the power method can be restated in terms of damage where an ant lives if it has less damage than all of its enemies within range
2011-03-22T09:08:38  <antimatroid> than each* might be a bit clearer

2011-03-22T10:29:57  <antimatroid> i am
2011-03-22T10:29:58  <antimatroid> what's up?
2011-03-22T10:31:04  <McLeopold> what if the damage method used 2 for each ant?
2011-03-22T10:31:19  <McLeopold> then you might avoid blocking more
2011-03-22T10:31:37  <McLeopold> and, we are using both sides of a 1:1 battle ratio
2011-03-22T10:32:06  <McLeopold> 1 ant can kill 2, but up against 3, the 3 all survive
2011-03-22T10:32:29  <antimatroid> hmmm, that might be a good idea
2011-03-22T10:32:42  <antimatroid> i will make some examples with sigh's thing
2011-03-22T10:32:58  <antimatroid> McLeopold: have you seen the new battle resolutions page?
2011-03-22T10:33:02  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-22T10:33:04  <antimatroid> feel free to add anything to that
2011-03-22T10:33:21  <McLeopold> how easy is it to use picture instead of the text?
2011-03-22T10:33:51  <McLeopold> oh, also, I think the attack radius should be reduced to 2 for the damage option
2011-03-22T10:33:53  <antimatroid> i have no idea how to convert text to image
2011-03-22T10:34:10  <antimatroid> McLeopold: so did janzert and i, until we realised you can still block 2 passages
2011-03-22T10:34:13  <McLeopold> I'm thinking like what you did in the forums awhile back
2011-03-22T10:34:25  <McLeopold> yes, but not as easily
2011-03-22T10:34:48  <antimatroid> so spawn = sqrt(2) and attack = sqrt(4)?
2011-03-22T10:34:52  <McLeopold> And it's nice to be able to know that you can do a focused attack at distance 2 orthogonally
2011-03-22T10:35:08  <McLeopold> it's easier to see
2011-03-22T10:35:22  <antimatroid> yeah i was originally for 2
2011-03-22T10:35:26  <antimatroid> but don't mind too much either way
2011-03-22T10:35:31  <McLeopold> if we do damage=2, then I'd go back up to 5
2011-03-22T10:35:46  <antimatroid> well leave it at 5 for right now
2011-03-22T10:35:53  <antimatroid> i'll play around with damage = 2 :P
2011-03-22T10:36:42  <antimatroid> i find it hard to see damage being beaten though
2011-03-22T10:37:04  <antimatroid> support sucks, power is too confusing and closest is less interesting
2011-03-22T10:37:32  <antimatroid> if deadlocks become a problem, we can fix it by making sure a 3x3 block can traverse the map
2011-03-22T10:39:57  <McLeopold> yes, let's make damage=2 the default right now
2011-03-22T10:44:18  <antimatroid> it doesn't work when i change line 464 to
2011-03-22T10:44:18  <antimatroid> "damage_per_enemy = Fraction(2, len(enemies))" :\
2011-03-22T10:44:29  <antimatroid> aab just kills the right most a and b
2011-03-22T10:46:15  <McLeopold> that's weird
2011-03-22T10:46:31  <antimatroid> it is
2011-03-22T10:46:36  <antimatroid> i can't work out what's causing it
2011-03-22T10:46:40  <antimatroid> is that happening for you?
2011-03-22T10:46:52  <McLeopold> I'll have to try
2011-03-22T10:47:27  <antimatroid> oh, is his overloading of score an issue?
2011-03-22T10:47:38  <antimatroid> he has score for self and score inside the function
2011-03-22T10:47:43  <antimatroid> and refers to both
2011-03-22T10:48:50  <antimatroid> McLeopold: nevermind
2011-03-22T10:50:02  <antimatroid> i had tried making my own second function, but i need to change more if i want to run both rules alongside each other like that
2011-03-22T10:50:59  <McLeopold> works for me
2011-03-22T10:51:38  <antimatroid> both a's die?
2011-03-22T10:52:04  <antimatroid> yeah, mines working now
2011-03-22T10:53:39  <antimatroid> that eliminates blocking 2 width passages
2011-03-22T10:53:58  <antimatroid> you can still block 1 width, but only for a REALLY blocked off 1 width passage
2011-03-22T10:54:08  <McLeopold> it should also make winning large battles without losses more difficult
2011-03-22T10:54:18  <antimatroid> yes
2011-03-22T10:54:46  <antimatroid> should i update the wiki to say that's what the damage option is?
2011-03-22T10:55:27  <McLeopold> maybe another option, damage=2 and damage=1
2011-03-22T10:57:26  <antimatroid> hmmm, i don't think sigh would like that
2011-03-22T10:57:34  <antimatroid> i could rename it to be more general
2011-03-22T10:57:48  <antimatroid> an ant has d damage to distribute each turn
2011-03-22T11:02:12  <antimatroid> actually, if we take it back to 2
2011-03-22T11:02:15  <antimatroid> there is no blocking?
2011-03-22T11:02:23  <antimatroid> attack radius that is
2011-03-22T11:03:07  <antimatroid> or move it up to 3
2011-03-22T11:03:54  <antimatroid> McLeopold: a.b.c kills all three again for either of the alternate damage options though

2011-03-22T11:59:30  <antimatroid> if i have all strategies inherit strategy, then i can just have a function inside game to return a new strategy?
2011-03-22T12:00:03  <antimatroid> strategies can be thought of a lot like iterators, although i haven't actually got them defined inside NGame etc.
2011-03-22T12:00:25  <janzert> yep, as long as the generic strategy contains all the information you function needs
2011-03-22T12:00:33  <antimatroid> yep, that's the plan

2011-03-22T12:01:11  <janzert> btw, not uncommon to realize the answer for a programming problem just from stating it "out loud"/written out
2011-03-22T12:01:19  <antimatroid> yeah i know
2011-03-22T12:01:25  <janzert> i.e. see rubber ducky programming :)
2011-03-22T12:01:32  <antimatroid> although i'm unsure again, how will my newstrategy function know what type to send back
2011-03-22T12:01:49  <antimatroid> i can't have a template Game and call Game::Strategy, c++ hates it

2011-03-22T12:02:31  <janzert> the function has to return the same specific type as it received?
2011-03-22T12:02:50  <antimatroid> it needs to take say an NGame and return an NStrategy
2011-03-22T12:03:40  <janzert> I'd probably use a virtual factory function on game class
2011-03-22T12:04:00  <antimatroid> what's that? :P
2011-03-22T12:04:38  <janzert> basically Game.get_strategy(blah, blah, blah) that returns the correct strategy for that game
2011-03-22T12:04:50  <janzert> or create_strategy() if you prefer
2011-03-22T12:05:37  <janzert> sorry gotta run, see you

2011-03-22T12:38:30  <Stocha> im all for damage rule now.
2011-03-22T12:38:51  <Stocha> but i want the X value to be random for each game, and hidden from the bots :p
2011-03-22T12:39:09  <Stocha> Also maybe we need a bigger fighting radius
2011-03-22T12:39:28  <Stocha> (than radius2=5)
2011-03-22T12:39:53  <Stocha> I want the X=0.01 be really devastating for stacking ants :p
2011-03-22T12:41:22  <antimatroid> lol, a hidden x from the bots
2011-03-22T12:41:24  <antimatroid> is that a joke?
2011-03-22T12:41:53  <antimatroid> it would suck if you can't correctly work out the outcome of potential moves
2011-03-22T12:42:46  <Stocha> you can
2011-03-22T12:42:54  <Stocha> only you have to explore a bit before.

2011-03-22T12:43:10  <Stocha> that's also what the dark fog of ware is all about.
2011-03-22T12:43:22  <Stocha> the fact that the map is unknown at the start.
2011-03-22T12:43:51  <Stocha> And, it doesn't make any changes needes. And is a real challenge to get a bot do things right in as much games as possible.
2011-03-22T12:44:58  <Stocha> It also eliminates most of the blocking trouble. Some game will have blocking in, and you can try to use that to your advantage. But you will need to take risk or time to find out that it may work
2011-03-22T12:45:14  <Stocha> so there are a lot a of things to try, and do, with the hidden X.
2011-03-22T12:45:55  <Stocha> From the outcome of few battle the bot will be able to guess a value for x. Now he has to adapt.
2011-03-22T12:45:58  <Frontier> amstan: Can we have a output directory for the products of the Makefiles?
2011-03-22T12:46:18  <Stocha> does that still sound really dirty to you antimatroid ?
2011-03-22T12:46:58  <antimatroid> Stocha: i don't like making people having to work out X for themselves
2011-03-22T12:47:09  <antimatroid> it'd be like varying the view/battle/spawn radius each game
2011-03-22T12:47:12  <Stocha> why do we make them having to work out the map then ?
2011-03-22T12:47:14  <antimatroid> that's too much variation
2011-03-22T12:47:27  <antimatroid> because they do :P

2011-03-22T12:47:50  <Stocha> the fighting rules variation is a big one, but an interesting one i think. One that people might consider.
2011-03-22T12:48:07  <antimatroid> it'd be hard to work out what works best when

2011-03-22T12:48:09  <Frontier> amstan: btw, $JAVA_HOME seems to be the correct way to access the JRE.
2011-03-22T12:48:14  <Stocha> And it avoid some problems in the game being to easy to solve.
2011-03-22T12:48:23  <antimatroid> the game isn't easy to solve
2011-03-22T12:48:40  <Stocha> that's the point isn't it ? that the game is a challenge.
2011-03-22T12:48:51  <Stocha> it's not called the AI straight way after all.
2011-03-22T12:49:30  <Stocha> The problem with X, is that there are no values that are really appealing for being on all the time.
2011-03-22T12:49:39  <amstan> Frontier: i don't have that in my path
2011-03-22T12:49:43  <amstan> yet i can compile things..
2011-03-22T12:49:44  <Frontier> amstan: At first I though the dist folder is for output, but the code for the starter bots is in there
2011-03-22T12:49:48  <Stocha> View radius, and spawn radius are not taht problematic.
2011-03-22T12:49:55  <Stocha> you juste choose one, and go on with them.
2011-03-22T12:50:20  <Frontier> amstan: You don't need it on the path, but you can probably call make with "JAVA_HOME=... make"
2011-03-22T12:50:49  <Stocha> If you say that X is random (among some fixed set of value giving wide range of behavior)
2011-03-22T12:50:56  <Stocha> the game rules a pretty much settled
2011-03-22T12:51:00  <Frontier> did you mean shell environment instead of path?
2011-03-22T12:51:04  <amstan> Frontier: the makefile's point is to automate such things.. there's no point in having the makefile if you're going to be searching for path and stuff
2011-03-22T12:51:20  <Stocha> if X is fixed, you have to find the best value for it. That's a hard work. And you can still go very wrong about it.
2011-03-22T12:51:49  <McLeopold> if it can be very wrong, why would we want it in the random list of X's?

2011-03-22T12:51:51  <Frontier> amstan: then set the variable in your system environment
2011-03-22T12:52:03  <amstan> Frontier: to what?
2011-03-22T12:52:19  <Frontier> the installation of java
2011-03-22T12:52:20  <Stocha> If it can be very wrong, we don't want it in the list McLeopold.
2011-03-22T12:52:28  <amstan> Frontier: i don't even know where that is
2011-03-22T12:52:30  <Stocha> But wrong, maybe interesting but easy to solve.
2011-03-22T12:52:42  <Stocha> easy being after a month of hard work :p
2011-03-22T12:52:45  <Frontier> /opt/sun-jdk... ?
2011-03-22T12:52:53  <amstan> it's definatelly not in opt
2011-03-22T12:52:56  <amstan> my opt is empty
2011-03-22T12:53:11  <amstan> isn't there like a command you can run to find it?
2011-03-22T12:53:15  <Stocha> that would mean, you choose one interesting value, and it get solved a month after the challenge begins. that i call going very wrong.
2011-03-22T12:53:22  <McLeopold> which javac?
2011-03-22T12:53:25  <Frontier> no, that is why there is an environment variable :p
2011-03-22T12:53:35  <amstan> Frontier: well.. it's not set for some reason
2011-03-22T12:53:52  <Stocha> If you have a set of value, and one is solved after a month, there is still room for people to fight over the others values :p
2011-03-22T12:54:14  <Stocha> provided their is a few of them.
2011-03-22T12:54:29  <Stocha> Then, also, you can't fully exploit the values property at the start
2011-03-22T12:54:39  <Stocha> for example if you have 0.01 and 1
2011-03-22T12:54:50  <Stocha> and 1 is known to allow easy bloking
2011-03-22T12:54:58  <janzert> amstan: "whereis javac"?
2011-03-22T12:55:04  <McLeopold> We aren't going to pick more than 1 battle resolution.  So, keep doing tests to see which one is right.
2011-03-22T12:55:10  <Stocha> you wouldn't be able to block fully at the start (which is when it mostly is usefull really)
2011-03-22T12:55:13  <janzert> or whereis java
2011-03-22T12:55:20  <Stocha> I'll keep testing.
2011-03-22T12:55:21  <amstan> janzert: i get /usb/bin/javac
2011-03-22T12:55:22  <Frontier> usually javac us just a symlink to javac
2011-03-22T12:55:36  <Stocha> But really, that seems save to have some variations for x, in.
2011-03-22T12:55:49  <Frontier> or on my setup a link to 'run-java-tool' which is again a wrapper... and so on :p
2011-03-22T12:55:50  <Stocha> safe
2011-03-22T12:56:09  <amstan> ugh... http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=ubuntu+javahome
2011-03-22T12:56:11  <Stocha> Where as any fixed value may be risky.
2011-03-22T12:56:12  <amstan> why is it not already set?
2011-03-22T12:57:09  <Stocha> If i'm proposed with say 5 values of X hidden and randomly chosen for X game, and i want a bot, i go like : woow. That's challenging.
2011-03-22T12:57:18  <Stocha> but i think it's solvable
2011-03-22T12:57:34  <Stocha> so i would work hard to find a way to exploit it best.
2011-03-22T12:57:42  <Frontier> so ... /usr/lib/sun-jdk or j2sdk ?
2011-03-22T12:57:47  <Stocha> I agree that it is challenging though.
2011-03-22T12:57:59  <amstan> maybe.. but my point is that this should be cross platform
2011-03-22T12:58:08  <amstan> without requiring the user installing to set paths manually
2011-03-22T12:58:19  <amstan> he should be able to type make and let it work
2011-03-22T12:58:36  <Stocha> You'll have  lot of fixed things. The ratio of ground/water, the map size, the map generation algorithm and rules, the food generation algorithm and rules and so on. Pretty much everything.
2011-03-22T12:59:27  <Stocha> Having one variable to play around isn't that dirty. It is a good challenge. Especially if it's around fighting. Discover if you have to kamikaze or block.
2011-03-22T12:59:32  <Stocha> and how to do it best.
2011-03-22T12:59:35  <Frontier> amstan: I looked on the internet and usually found articles saying that it would be best to set JAVA_HOME
2011-03-22T12:59:49  <Stocha> it adds some interest to the value of being interested in each games.
2011-03-22T13:00:30  <amstan> Frontier: i just don't get why the java installer doesn't set this already...
2011-03-22T13:00:37  <janzert> btw ratio of ground/water, map size and map generation aren't fixed
2011-03-22T13:00:37  <Frontier> I could compile a simple Java application, run it and let it print the path of its runtime environment. But that seems a bit too much

2011-03-22T13:01:07  <janzert> certainly not before the contest starts
2011-03-22T13:01:09  <Stocha> that is nasty, and boring.
2011-03-22T13:01:29  <Stocha> because the correct tuning can depend on the map size
2011-03-22T13:01:32  <Stocha> and algorithm
2011-03-22T13:01:33  <Frontier> amstan: maybe because there is no default? you can have several jres from different vendors
2011-03-22T13:01:42  <Frontier> but try to set it up with: sudo update-alternatives --config java
2011-03-22T13:01:47  <Stocha> that's too much uninteresting variables to explore.

2011-03-22T13:13:26  <Stocha_> the question ?
2011-03-22T13:13:37  <antimatroid> i have Game as a parent of NGame, EGame etc.
2011-03-22T13:13:53  <antimatroid> i want to be able to write functions for Game that can use functions inside the instance of NGame, EGame etc.
2011-03-22T13:14:10  <antimatroid> they will all have the function, but each will be different
2011-03-22T13:14:35  <Stocha_> that's a virtual function i guess
2011-03-22T13:14:40  <Stocha_> or a functor variable
2011-03-22T13:14:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: does C++ have interfaces?

2011-03-22T13:15:44  <antrn11> C++ has abstract classes that can act as interfaces. interfaces are not needed since class can have multiple parents

2011-03-22T13:19:57  <antrn11> antimatroid: i'm not sure if this is an answer to your problem but here goes: you can create a method for Game class that is virtual and that you overload in child class. then just call that method and it should call the cihld classes method
2011-03-22T13:20:00  <Stocha_> More than one ennemy i still miss the value off right now.
2011-03-22T13:20:10  <McLeopold> Stocha_: your max path will be 65536
2011-03-22T13:20:33  <Stocha_> It's just too long to compute
2011-03-22T13:20:43  <Stocha_> i have trouble with depth 20 at the moment :p
2011-03-22T13:20:45  <antimatroid> antrn11: hmmm, okay, let me see how i go
2011-03-22T13:20:46  <McLeopold> antimatroid: don't give up, what you're wanting is a basic concept of oop
2011-03-22T13:20:50  <Stocha_> (although there probably is a trouble somewhere)

2011-03-22T13:26:52  <McLeopold> antimatroid: shouldn't you be working on map generation instead of getting a jump start on your bot?
2011-03-22T13:26:53  <antrn11> ok, that's good to hear

2011-03-22T13:27:42  <antimatroid> it's for that
2011-03-22T13:27:46  <antimatroid> although it's a bit of a mess atm
2011-03-22T13:28:28  <antimatroid> and i have quite a bit of other stuff from old revisions yet to add in, i'm trying to give everything a last clean before making it so big that a clean up would just be impossible for everything
2011-03-22T13:29:20  <Frontier> antimatroid: Don't forget to add some unittests
2011-03-22T13:29:37  <antimatroid> what are they exactly?
2011-03-22T13:29:55  <Frontier> they test parts of your program
2011-03-22T13:29:56  <antimatroid> is it just a program to run a bunch of sample input and compare it to past data?
2011-03-22T13:30:17  <antimatroid> i need to work out exceptions too :P
2011-03-22T13:30:23  <Frontier> for example you could test a single function with different input and check the output
2011-03-22T13:30:42  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-22T13:30:49  <antimatroid> i also don't know how to delete a file on github
2011-03-22T13:30:58  <antimatroid> i did the whole git rm thing, but it didn't actually remove the file :\

2011-03-22T13:31:18  <Frontier> you need to commit the rm and then push
2011-03-22T13:31:22  <antimatroid> McLeopold: yes
2011-03-22T13:31:34  <antimatroid> i updated other stuff at the same time

2011-03-22T13:31:58  <McLeopold> did you do a commit all, or specific files?
2011-03-22T13:32:02  <Frontier> it should just work. i used git rm myself and had no trouble

2011-03-22T13:33:21  <antimatroid> is that different to a normal commit?
2011-03-22T13:33:26  <McLeopold> do a git status to see if they are still pending
2011-03-22T13:34:16  <antimatroid> oh, so i need to do git add/rm files ?

2011-03-22T16:48:23  <lavalamp> So uploaded code can now use makefiles?
2011-03-22T16:48:58  <Frontier> amstan: The starter package Makefile may zip up temp files in the bot directories if they weren't clean before
2011-03-22T16:49:30  <Frontier> lavalamp: looks like we are heading that way :)
2011-03-22T16:50:16  <lavalamp> That would be cool. Go projects are kinda meant to be multiple packages and makefiles make that happen...
2011-03-22T16:50:19  <Frontier> Also how is the GO Makefile supposed to work? It includes files that don't exist :p
2011-03-22T16:50:34  <lavalamp> Haha I will look at it
2011-03-22T16:50:54  <lavalamp> It's probably referencing a *_test.go file that I didn't upload
2011-03-22T16:51:04  <lavalamp> because it would cause a non-makefile build to fail
2011-03-22T16:51:41  <lavalamp> I have a question about the worker setup script
2011-03-22T16:51:55  <lavalamp> I was looking at updating the go install section
2011-03-22T16:52:06  <lavalamp> to make it use these packages: http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/4ef5d65e5feb4e89
2011-03-22T16:52:28  <lavalamp> But I didn't see anywhere else where people added non-default repositories
2011-03-22T16:52:57  <lavalamp> So I wasn't sure... is that even allowed?
2011-03-22T16:54:32  <Frontier> I think third-party Debian/Ubuntu repositories are allowed. For D it will just be a .deb package. Everything down to bare source code is allowed.

2011-03-22T20:15:36  <sigh> indeed, which leads me to wonder why you think j3camero is taken by someone else :P
2011-03-22T20:16:27  <jj3camero> I don't know. I don't think I have irssi open in another screen session or anything.
2011-03-22T20:19:29  <sigh> I can remember this happening before
2011-03-22T20:21:36  <Zannick> whois says you're both on the same server

2011-03-22T20:47:27  <McLeopold> j3camero: are you up on the battle options?
2011-03-22T20:47:46  <j3camero> More or less. Let's just keep it parameterized and decide later.
2011-03-22T20:48:05  <j3camero> If that's okay with everybody.
2011-03-22T20:48:28  <McLeopold> I think they are different enough that we ought to have an idea
2011-03-22T20:49:11  <McLeopold> I guess I would categorize them as 1:1 kill ratio, or above or below that
2011-03-22T20:49:29  <McLeopold> That is what I think we should decide now.  The details of that could come later.
2011-03-22T20:54:15  <j3camero> Whatever it is, we've got to keep it ridiculously simple. Simple in the sense of being able to code to it, not in the sense that the actual battle resolution algorithm is simple.
2011-03-22T20:55:14  <j3camero> So I guess if we have to restrict the options at this stage, I would go with whichever category of algorithms will best line up with people's first intuitions.

2011-03-22T21:30:50  * amstan is a java noob
2011-03-22T21:31:01  <amstan> i want a data structure that i can use like the python set
2011-03-22T21:31:13  <amstan> where i can add stuff to it, and check for membership
2011-03-22T21:31:29  <amstan> maybe... like the python array [], actually, i might need order
2011-03-22T21:32:11  <Frontier> amstan: a SortedSet maybe?
2011-03-22T21:32:40  * amstan is looking it up

2011-03-22T21:35:20  <Frontier> Sure, you declare it like this: SortedSet<MyObjectClass> ...
2011-03-22T21:35:36  <McLeopold> destinations is a hashset to ensure you don't step on yourself
2011-03-22T21:36:02  <Frontier> There is also a TreeSet and a HashSet
2011-03-22T21:36:10  <McLeopold> Also, declare the generic types, but instantiate the specific types
2011-03-22T21:36:33  <amstan> also.. how would i go about copying such sets?
2011-03-22T21:36:44  <amstan> i don't want my new variable to just point to the old one, i want a copy
2011-03-22T21:37:18  <Frontier> A shallow or a deep copy?
2011-03-22T21:37:22  <amstan> shallow
2011-03-22T21:38:26  <Frontier> then use .clone() on the list

2011-03-22T21:43:21  <Frontier> *shudders*
2011-03-22T21:43:43  <Frontier> no, since you declared the element type
2011-03-22T21:44:31  <amstan> Frontier: ok.. so like this: SortedSet directions = new SortedSet<Compass>;

2011-03-22T21:45:22  <amstan> it just needs an equals..
2011-03-22T21:45:33  <Frontier> You have a SortedSet, so the library needs a way to sort them.

2011-03-22T21:47:37  <Frontier> should be fine except for the missing <Compass> in the first line. You need it wherever you use the type
2011-03-22T21:47:52  <Frontier> SortedSet<Compass> = new SortedSet<Compass>();
2011-03-22T21:50:04  <Frontier> I can really recommend Eclipse even for small projects, because there you just type "SortedSet<Compass> = new " and press Ctrl+Enter. The IDE will show an autocompletion with the constructor for the declared object. It can also add casts to objects automagically if required.
2011-03-22T21:50:45  <amstan> hmm
2011-03-22T21:50:51  <amstan> so.. i get these: http://pastebin.com/VsK4L1h8
2011-03-22T21:51:16  <Frontier> amstan: try a HashSet, it works without a Comparator
2011-03-22T21:51:36  <amstan> Frontier: same
2011-03-22T21:51:44  <amstan> i think i can give it a comparator..
2011-03-22T21:52:09  <Frontier> is the Compass declared somewhere? :p
2011-03-22T21:52:22  <amstan> nope, i don't have the source..
2011-03-22T21:52:32  <amstan> it's a contest with no documentation about the classes, totally in java
2011-03-22T21:52:39  <amstan> and.. closed source
2011-03-22T21:52:47  <Frontier> ok you NEED the jar on the classpath
2011-03-22T21:53:08  <Frontier> and add the right import line. ... or let Eclipse do that for you ^^
2011-03-22T21:53:09  <amstan> Frontier: nope.. i compiled it before, works fine
2011-03-22T21:53:31  <Frontier> hmm, can you hint me to it? where can i download the jar?
2011-03-22T21:53:33  <amstan> it's a jar with the contest code and everything, i just have to javac my source file and it somehow works
2011-03-22T21:54:06  <Frontier> well I don't know how the compiler would know about Compass if the jar isn't on the classpath

2011-03-22T21:54:49  <amstan> maybe that's how it can do it
2011-03-22T21:55:12  <amstan> isn't pwd included in classpath or something?
2011-03-22T21:56:09  <Frontier> i was convinced that jars have to be named
2011-03-22T21:58:47  <Frontier> ok try this: 			Compass direction;

2011-03-22T22:02:04  <amstan> do i just cast?
2011-03-22T22:02:21  <Frontier> look above ^
2011-03-22T22:02:34  <Frontier> you declared the Iterator wrongly
2011-03-22T22:03:10  <amstan> Frontier: ok.. got it now, except hashset doesn't have .remove
2011-03-22T22:03:58  <Frontier> oh
2011-03-22T22:04:22  <Frontier> it has
2011-03-22T22:04:45  <Frontier> even the iterator has a remove method
2011-03-22T22:05:16  <amstan> yeah, it's good
2011-03-22T22:05:22  <amstan> except: "variable direction might not have been initialized"
2011-03-22T22:05:47  <amstan> ffuuu java! when i write code that does that, you should take my word for it, and not decide to not compile
2011-03-22T22:05:57  <Frontier> that is because you dont set it to a value when you start the for
2011-03-22T22:06:15  <amstan> yes, i know, but like.. ugh
2011-03-22T22:06:54  <Frontier> how about 			for (Compass compass : directions) { ...			}
2011-03-22T22:08:00  <Frontier> although, if you want to remove items in the for-loop, you better stick with the iterator and make it a while loop
2011-03-22T22:09:17  <Frontier> 			Iterator<Compass> it = directions.iterator();
2011-03-22T22:09:18  <Frontier> 			while (it.hasNext()) {
2011-03-22T22:09:18  <Frontier> 				Compass direction = it.next();
2011-03-22T22:09:18  <Frontier> 				it.remove();
2011-03-22T22:09:18  <Frontier> 			}
2011-03-22T22:10:39  <amstan> Frontier: yeah, looks ok, except it crashed, out of bounds
2011-03-22T22:11:00  <amstan> wait.. hmm
2011-03-22T22:11:22  <amstan> yeah.. i get it, it crashes because i'm taking stuff out of the set without the iterator knowing
2011-03-22T22:11:27  <amstan> maybe? lol
2011-03-22T22:11:35  <Frontier> definitly ^^
2011-03-22T22:11:48  <amstan> i want to have a pruned set at the end
2011-03-22T22:11:59  <amstan> does it.remove remove it from the set too?
2011-03-22T22:12:41  <Frontier> That what the remove method on iterators in any language is for, yes.
2011-03-22T22:13:29  <Frontier> On a linked list is is an O(1) operation, because the iterator is already at the right position. If you called list.remove(item), the list would have to be searched first
2011-03-22T22:15:46  <amstan> oh fun: remove() in java.util.Iterator<amazebot2011.Compass> cannot be applied to (amazebot2011.Compass)
2011-03-22T22:16:09  <amstan> oh..
2011-03-22T22:16:14  <amstan> wait, it.remove(), with no arguments
