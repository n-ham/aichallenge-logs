2012-01-11T01:29:21  <mleise> 27ms for #215 :D
2012-01-11T01:31:36  <pairofdice> That looks familiar :p
2012-01-11T01:36:59  <pairofdice> Congratulations, the answer you gave to problem 92 is correct.
2012-01-11T01:37:54  <antimatroid> slow down people
2012-01-11T01:37:56  <pairofdice> Though that took far too long
2012-01-11T01:37:57  <antimatroid> i don't have time for pe atm
2012-01-11T01:38:06  <antimatroid> :D
2012-01-11T01:42:48  <mleise> and I really thought #215 would be one that ends up taking way more than a second
2012-01-11T01:44:16  <pairofdice> Yeah, sure looks like that at first
2012-01-11T01:44:23  <pairofdice> And at second
2012-01-11T01:45:04  <mleise> I only chose it, because that was the highest, mcstar had solved
2012-01-11T01:45:51  <mleise> and I didn't have that bad feeling, that I would never find the solution, as with the binary Morse code problem
2012-01-11T01:46:48  <pairofdice> Yes, but mcstar solved that non-PE problem that basically the same
2012-01-11T01:47:01  <mleise> i see
2012-01-11T01:47:35  <mleise> btw, my Pascal triangle struct worked like a charm. That's part of the 27ms performance.
2012-01-11T01:48:04  <mleise> nah ... not really. I only query it 6 times :p

2012-01-11T13:20:37  <mcstar> a float is not an answer

2012-01-11T14:44:27  <rwest> well actually
2012-01-11T14:44:36  <jcdjcd> the trick is I think you don't actually get the factors.
2012-01-11T14:44:50  <rwest> I think getting the factors once
2012-01-11T14:44:57  <rwest> like the lowest factors
2012-01-11T14:45:38  <rwest> maybe taking the prime factors and building from them

2012-01-11T17:29:11  <mleise> Ah this is cute: "mixin registerThisModule;" at the end of my source code registers the module with the main app. So depending on what EulerProject.net source files I pass to the compiler, they make themselves known to the app and get executed. No manual import in the main module required. :)

2012-01-11T17:33:11  <mleise> jstrong: 1139 threads sounds more like a bug
2012-01-11T17:33:23  <jstrong> it is a bug
2012-01-11T17:33:32  <jstrong> clearly no CINEMA webpage should take  up to 5 gigs of ram
2012-01-11T17:33:37  <jstrong> and 100% of a quad core
2012-01-11T17:33:54  <jstrong> but just the fact that you can achieve that level of failure with bad code in flash
2012-01-11T17:33:56  <jstrong> is frightening
2012-01-11T17:34:04  <jstrong> also epic fail of safari for not sandboxing the plugin
