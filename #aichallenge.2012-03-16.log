2012-03-16T11:50:21  <antimatroid> plus i just started phd in january and have no intentions of leaving that
2012-03-16T11:50:48  <antimatroid> there needs to be a rewrite of the backend before we hold another contest
2012-03-16T11:51:11  <antimatroid> i don't think anyone wants to finalise anything game wise until that is at least well under way
2012-03-16T11:51:18  <antimatroid> and as far as i know no one is working on a new backend
2012-03-16T11:52:17  <antimatroid> /s/about/as :P
2012-03-16T11:52:28  <smiley1983> haha, yes, that sounds about right. I was thinking of putting up a TCP server with pw, ants, asteroids and risk
2012-03-16T11:52:38  <antimatroid> AND TRON
2012-03-16T11:52:43  <antimatroid> HOW COULD YOU FORGET TRON?
2012-03-16T11:52:46  <antimatroid> :D
2012-03-16T11:52:48  <smiley1983> yes, and tron.
2012-03-16T11:53:06  <antimatroid> i am more keen to play around with tron again than anything else
2012-03-16T11:53:08  <smiley1983> I wasn't there for tron, so it's actually the one I have the most interest in.
2012-03-16T11:53:12  <antimatroid> although write a new game engine for it
2012-03-16T11:53:26  <antimatroid> the old one passed the entire game board each turn i think
2012-03-16T11:53:26  <thestinger> smiley1983: would be a good idea to make a shiny new tcp server
2012-03-16T11:53:32  <antimatroid> can just pass the players moves to people
2012-03-16T11:53:40  <thestinger> not a buggy one with resource leaks like the last
2012-03-16T11:53:47  <smiley1983> yes, I thought a new engine might be needed
2012-03-16T11:53:48  <antimatroid> i looked at doing that a few months ago, current one is so gross :p
2012-03-16T11:53:58  <antimatroid> players'*
2012-03-16T11:54:00  <antimatroid> it's late :P
2012-03-16T11:54:07  <thestinger> antimatroid: s/late/early/
2012-03-16T11:54:11  <thestinger> you live in the wrong time zone
2012-03-16T11:54:19  <smiley1983> I now know that writing a new game engine is non-trivial but also quite possible
2012-03-16T11:54:41  <antimatroid> smiley1983: i did an ants prototype engine in c++ last year, that was fun
2012-03-16T11:54:48  <antimatroid> although my processor class was way too slow
2012-03-16T11:55:18  <smiley1983> thestinger: I think people would use it, it's just a matter of working out the technical stuff so that once the server is paid for, it can be put to work immediately
2012-03-16T11:55:28  <antimatroid> i think a tcp server with past contests up would certainly get people interested
2012-03-16T11:55:47  <thestinger> making a new tcp server/client would be fun
2012-03-16T11:55:51  <smiley1983> This is all just hypothetical planning, and may or may not happen.
2012-03-16T11:56:22  <thestinger> smiley1983: it would be nice to actually have it on the official site next time imo
2012-03-16T11:56:30  <thestinger> so starting work on it now would be great
2012-03-16T11:56:34  <antimatroid> thestinger: i've been saying that since tron :P
2012-03-16T11:56:52  <thestinger> python with actual threads for each connection is a bad fit for it
2012-03-16T11:56:57  <antimatroid> i think the pacman problem is quite interesting
2012-03-16T11:56:59  <thestinger> it won't scale up to all the players
2012-03-16T11:57:20  <antimatroid> c++ all the things!
2012-03-16T11:57:23  <thestinger> no
2012-03-16T11:57:25  <antimatroid> :p
2012-03-16T11:57:34  <thestinger> C++ is terrible for this :P
2012-03-16T11:57:47  <thestinger> that pretty much forces you to use threads or async with boost::asio just like python does
2012-03-16T11:58:01  <thestinger> erlang or go :)
2012-03-16T11:58:24  <antimatroid> https://github.com/antimatroid/GTL/blob/master/tools/Process.h
2012-03-16T11:58:42  <antimatroid> that's my really slow process struct which can be used to io with processes like a stream
2012-03-16T11:59:15  <antimatroid> i dunno what makes it so slow, maybe the string stream in the input function at the bottom
2012-03-16T12:00:02  <thestinger> you can make a really nice multiple producer and multiple consumer channel in a few lines
2012-03-16T12:00:17  <thestinger> but threads just don't work out well for networking

2012-03-16T12:03:22  <antimatroid> i no longer use windows on any machines which is handy
2012-03-16T12:03:30  <antimatroid> well i do in my office at my uni, but i don't program there
2012-03-16T12:03:46  <thestinger> yeah, the hacky implementations of fork() on windows are crap
2012-03-16T12:03:49  <thestinger> no copy-on-write
2012-03-16T12:04:05  <thestinger> the linux scheduler sees threads/processes as the same thing iirc, so there's only ~50% overhead
2012-03-16T12:04:23  <thestinger> (compared to a posix thread, which is actually not so lightweight)
2012-03-16T12:04:46  <antimatroid> what do you mean by overhead?
2012-03-16T12:04:50  <antimatroid> and why is there 50%?
2012-03-16T12:05:25  <thestinger> each posix thread has a stack
2012-03-16T12:05:40  <thestinger> so the overhead is whatever the stack size is
2012-03-16T12:05:57  <smiley1983> Are the channel logs still available? The link to contestbot.aichallenge.org no longer seems to contain them
2012-03-16T12:06:08  <thestinger> -s: stack size (kbytes)        8192
2012-03-16T12:06:11  <thestinger> default linux stack size
2012-03-16T12:06:17  <thestinger> ulimit -s to check
2012-03-16T12:06:22  <thestinger> so 8MB overhead per thread
2012-03-16T12:06:26  <thestinger> you can't just make 1 per client :P
2012-03-16T12:06:45  <thestinger> antimatroid: threads share the same address space, processes each have their own virtual memory
2012-03-16T12:06:56  <thestinger> linux (and every other *nix) cheats and does copy-on-write
2012-03-16T12:07:32  <antimatroid> hmm okay
2012-03-16T12:07:37  <antimatroid> that vaguely made sense :P
2012-03-16T12:07:41  <thestinger> windows doesn't, so multiprocessing on windows doesn't really work
2012-03-16T12:07:44  <antimatroid> i have a very poor understanding of things at that level
2012-03-16T12:08:12  <thestinger> Go, Erlang, Stackless Python, etc. give you lightweight threads
2012-03-16T12:08:22  <thestinger> they don't use the C stack, so threads have basically zero overhead
2012-03-16T12:08:40  <thestinger> you can make 200k of them and the memory usage will be a few kilobytes for each until they actually do something
2012-03-16T12:09:20  <thestinger> and they map them to posix threads
2012-03-16T12:09:33  <antimatroid> that would make life easier
2012-03-16T12:09:39  <thestinger> so you might have 4 real POSIX threads (1 or 2 for each core) and as many threads as you want

2012-03-16T12:14:22  <antimatroid> ie. <w_1, w_2 | w_iw_i = w_i and w_iw_{i+/-1}w_i = w_i} = {w_1, w_2, w_1w_2, w_2w_1}
2012-03-16T12:14:47  <antimatroid> has to be valid relations on the words to get a finite dictionary (invalid ones are possible)

2012-03-16T12:15:24  <antimatroid> not like markov chains
2012-03-16T12:15:31  <antimatroid> it's basically generating a semigroup from a presentation

2012-03-16T12:16:03  <antimatroid> i think i have a way to do it, but i'm not entirely sure
2012-03-16T12:16:52  <thestinger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups this?

2012-03-16T12:17:28  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-03-16T12:17:44  <antimatroid> although only for semigroups
2012-03-16T12:24:45  <antimatroid> thestinger: http://pastebin.com/EFYJvD2u
2012-03-16T12:24:54  <antimatroid> that describes how i'm trying to get at the problem
2012-03-16T12:25:00  <antimatroid> but i'm a little lost at the end
2012-03-16T12:25:21  <antimatroid> 1. will i need* to iteratively do this ***

2012-03-16T12:32:11  <antimatroid> it's surprisingly hard
2012-03-16T12:32:38  <thestinger> I got distracted by making a package for something
2012-03-16T12:32:44  * thestinger fails at doing 20 things at once
2012-03-16T12:35:08  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/cES5DZcu
2012-03-16T12:35:11  <antimatroid> that's by no means finished
2012-03-16T12:35:20  <antimatroid> but that's what i started doing the other day in the middle of the night
2012-03-16T12:36:30  <antimatroid> i wish there was a combo break call
2012-03-16T12:36:44  <antimatroid> for when i want to break out of more than one loop
2012-03-16T12:37:33  <antimatroid> that == operator on words could probably be removed too, you'd want to use something else since i just typedefed words as strings
2012-03-16T12:55:19  <thestinger> I think I'm done packaging that thing
2012-03-16T12:55:36  <thestinger> now to fix up this multiple producer-consumer channel thing
2012-03-16T13:00:16  <thestinger> lol, I forget how to do initializer lists
2012-03-16T13:00:32  <thestinger> the C++11 thing
2012-03-16T13:06:05  <thestinger> antimatroid: a quick example of why clang is awesome:

2012-03-16T13:42:26  <thestinger> antimatroid: there, it works
2012-03-16T13:42:34  <thestinger> no race conditions and I think minimal locking
2012-03-16T13:42:49  <thestinger> and if I understand C++ correctly (I don't) it's exception safe
