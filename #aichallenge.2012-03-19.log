2012-03-19T01:10:46  <antimatroid> i was just thinking today, how would you represent the graph for ghosts in pacman?
2012-03-19T01:10:55  <antimatroid> it's a directed graph where they can't go backwards
2012-03-19T01:37:44  <mleise> yes, but that is hardly an interesting topic to discuss :D

2012-03-19T13:10:00  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-03-19T13:10:10  <antimatroid> you could both bump into each other if you're going for the ball or whatever
2012-03-19T13:10:25  <antimatroid> or go shoulder to shoulder while running, but you couldn't just run in and tackle a guy to the ground

2012-03-19T13:11:57  <antimatroid> you can do that in afl
2012-03-19T13:12:05  <antimatroid> but not as hardcore as rugby

2012-03-19T13:19:21  <mcstar> bleh
2012-03-19T13:19:25  <mcstar> ridiculous
2012-03-19T13:19:51  <mcstar> in real football you cant touch the ball
2012-03-19T13:19:52  <antimatroid> we breed them tough down here :P
2012-03-19T13:20:01  <mcstar> you call it soccer
2012-03-19T13:20:11  <antimatroid> a lot of people call it football here anyway
2012-03-19T13:20:20  <antimatroid> but most people think of football as afl
2012-03-19T13:20:31  <antimatroid> they're different games though, and afl is pretty hardcore
2012-03-19T13:20:53  <mcstar> honestly its a mess
2012-03-19T13:21:37  <mcstar> the ball is not even round
2012-03-19T13:21:46  <antimatroid> that makes it harder
2012-03-19T13:22:01  <antimatroid> plus it carries a lot further in the air
2012-03-19T13:22:40  <mcstar> but there is no goalkeeper
2012-03-19T13:23:16  <mcstar> and yeah, it is brutal
2012-03-19T13:23:46  <mcstar> it makes is more enjoyable for the mass, but i think makes it less 'tactical'
2012-03-19T13:24:50  <mcstar> i think those players are drugged before the game

2012-03-19T13:35:22  <delt0r> It typically is by default
2012-03-19T13:35:29  <delt0r> iptables -L
2012-03-19T13:35:42  <Zannick> you can just use /etc/hosts
2012-03-19T13:35:51  <Zannick> and map 127.0.0.1 to it
2012-03-19T13:36:34  <delt0r> Zannick: i prefer with a error packet gets generated somewhere so that FF etc don't just sit there for a time out interval
2012-03-19T13:36:35  <mcstar> by default?
2012-03-19T13:37:11  <delt0r> mcstar: its kind of deep in the kernal... the command iptables only changes the firewall rules on the tcp/ip stack IIRC
2012-03-19T13:37:11  <mcstar> Zannick: thats interesting
2012-03-19T13:37:15  <Zannick> run a simple http server on localhost that rejects everything \o_
2012-03-19T13:37:51  <delt0r> that is iptables does not need to run per say
2012-03-19T13:37:58  <mcstar> ah yeah, it is kernel level but by default no rule exists i think
2012-03-19T13:38:04  <delt0r> yea
2012-03-19T13:38:05  <mcstar> at least not on my machine
2012-03-19T13:38:44  <mcstar> Zannick: how do you suggest i dispose of the root password?
2012-03-19T13:38:50  <delt0r> neither here... but my home machine has a script that adds rules when a port scan is detected
2012-03-19T13:39:04  <Zannick> hm?
2012-03-19T13:39:20  <mcstar> so that i couldnt enable the internets again
2012-03-19T13:39:23  <mcstar> XD
2012-03-19T13:39:30  <mcstar> non-parental control
2012-03-19T13:39:39  <Zannick> hahaha

2012-03-19T16:27:53  <thestinger> Sent 2 hours and 56 minutes ago: <mcstar> what the alternative to hosts.deny?
2012-03-19T16:28:01  <thestinger> iptables (netfilter)
2012-03-19T16:28:02  <mcstar> ah
2012-03-19T16:28:05  <mcstar> yeah
2012-03-19T16:28:16  <mcstar> no more easy fiddleing
2012-03-19T16:28:16  <thestinger> hosts.deny was just for things compiled against libwrap
2012-03-19T16:28:25  <thestinger> it is pretty easy

2012-03-19T16:29:55  <mcstar> yes
2012-03-19T16:30:00  <thestinger> I did the programming one before watching the videos, (with the crappy algorithm) and then rewrote it after

2012-03-19T19:04:00  <mcstar> i did gave 1 wrong aswer

2012-03-19T19:04:52  <thestinger> it's just the upper bound
2012-03-19T19:04:59  <thestinger> I screwed up the last question _twice_
2012-03-19T19:05:18  <mcstar> wait
2012-03-19T19:05:25  <mcstar> i should do it again?
2012-03-19T19:05:27  <mcstar> or wtf
2012-03-19T19:05:27  <thestinger> yes
2012-03-19T19:05:32  <thestinger> your highest grade is used
2012-03-19T19:05:32  <mcstar> why?
2012-03-19T19:05:34  <thestinger> lol
2012-03-19T19:05:34  <mcstar> thats stupid
2012-03-19T19:05:41  <mcstar> wtf
2012-03-19T19:05:46  <thestinger> they only have 4 tries for the first one
2012-03-19T19:05:48  <mcstar> they show the right answers
2012-03-19T19:05:54  <thestinger> they dropped it down to a more reasonable 2 for the second
2012-03-19T19:06:02  <thestinger> mcstar: not really, they show which ones you got wrong
2012-03-19T19:06:06  <thestinger> they change them around a bit
2012-03-19T19:06:08  <thestinger> but not enough
2012-03-19T19:06:18  <thestinger> I think you get a randomized set of questions
2012-03-19T19:06:32  <mcstar> thestinger: but then i would have to do the hole test again
2012-03-19T19:06:37  <mcstar> i dont care
2012-03-19T19:06:40  <thestinger> ah
2012-03-19T19:06:42  <thestinger> :P
2012-03-19T19:06:43  <mcstar> i mean i dont care for that
2012-03-19T19:06:52  <mcstar> 7.25/8 is ok
2012-03-19T19:07:21  <thestinger> I was just lazy with answering the last question and didn't graph it
2012-03-19T19:07:30  <thestinger> and I made a silly mistake twice
2012-03-19T19:07:32  <mcstar> i didnt graph anything
2012-03-19T19:07:36  <thestinger> I wrote a twice
2012-03-19T19:07:42  <mcstar> oh
2012-03-19T19:09:04  <thestinger> I like that udacity has a real programming assignment each week
2012-03-19T19:09:14  <thestinger> where they unit test your code
2012-03-19T19:09:27  <thestinger> the theory questions there are boring though
2012-03-19T19:09:52  <thestinger> they feel like "intuition" questions, lots of them aren't based on the material that was covered
2012-03-19T19:10:04  <thestinger> they are easy, as long as you don't misinterpret them
2012-03-19T19:11:19  <thestinger> the unit videos have programming "quizzes" (works like the homework but you seen if you got it right immediately and can try again)
2012-03-19T19:11:54  <thestinger> so you build up a whole program throughout the unit and then the homework is usually "make this work for 2 dimensions instead of one" and stuff like that
