2011-12-26T06:23:00  <Accoun> somethin wrong with pithon coders cocks
2011-12-26T06:23:33  <Kettling> I looked at Python and Ruby and I thought, "yeah there are interesting ideas, but I already know perl, I already know C, and I use R for my mathematical analysis so what is python giving me?"
2011-12-26T06:23:55  <Accoun> pithon no any advantaje over perl, but veru slou and stuped
2011-12-26T06:24:57  <Accoun> it gives nothing
2011-12-26T06:25:18  <Kettling> so if I'm in a hurry and putting something together I use perl, and if I'm serious I use C, sometimes I use java, but this python thing just makes me work hard to no advantage
2011-12-26T06:25:37  <thestinger> it 'makes you work hard'?
2011-12-26T06:26:32  <Kettling> Yeah, everything is different in python... different from all the major languages for no reason but someone said, "hey I want something different"
2011-12-26T06:26:53  <thestinger> not really much different than other languages
2011-12-26T06:27:32  <thestinger> the syntax/semantics take a day to learn and the language and standard library are pretty consistent
2011-12-26T06:27:44  <Kettling> I have only so much time left in my life for new things, don't want to waste it learning again what I already know
2011-12-26T06:28:08  <thestinger> so don't - doesn't meant there's something wrong with it
2011-12-26T06:28:32  <Kettling> Hey, other people can do what they want with their life

2011-12-26T06:58:21  <Kettling> Are you guys worried about the European Central Bank slipping in their low interest "money printing" loans just before Christmas so the big banks get bailed out? Are we going to see inflation?
2011-12-26T06:59:22  <Kettling> Can we make money by just printing more money?

2011-12-26T07:06:06  <X-Scale> And yes, Inflation is the unavoidable byproduct of this printing press process. It's a hidden tax most people are forced to pay.

2011-12-26T07:07:16  <X-Scale> The difference between America and Europe is that America still fight wars all over the world to keep its empire, to keep plundering natural resources of other countries. Europe doesn't do that anymore. That gives an edge to America.

2011-12-26T11:19:09  <Extrarius> python is invaluable for things like our test framework, where we can run our applications across a huge VM farm containing every version of windows in several languages to ensure broad compatability and proper unicode handling
2011-12-26T11:20:47  <Extrarius> you don't write time critical things in python, of course, but most people don't write time critical things at all, so that is rarely an issue
2011-12-26T11:22:41  <Extrarius> it'd be silly (but kinda cool) to embed python in a device driver, but it'd be just as silly to write tens of thousands of lines of C or C++ code when several hundred in python acomplish the same thing
