2012-09-20T05:40:10  <antimatroidl> i was right
2012-09-20T05:40:16  <antimatroidl> you got sucked in didn't you?
2012-09-20T05:40:17  <mcstar> but i still find it unusual that you can see the sources of others'
2012-09-20T05:40:21  <mcstar> no
2012-09-20T05:40:23  <antimatroidl> yeah so do i
2012-09-20T05:40:25  <mcstar> i am no
2012-09-20T05:40:27  <mcstar> t
2012-09-20T05:40:33  <antimatroidl> is that denial?
2012-09-20T05:40:36  <mcstar> but im thinking about thinking about the problem
2012-09-20T05:40:50  <antimatroidl> ah, the first step to addiction
2012-09-20T05:40:54  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-20T05:41:12  <antimatroidl> i remember when planet wars was announced
2012-09-20T05:41:18  <antimatroidl> i knew it was going to be a rough 3 months aha
2012-09-20T05:41:27  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i came across someone on #haskel yesterday
2012-09-20T05:41:31  <mcstar> l
2012-09-20T05:41:57  <mcstar> he was about to build a contest, that would have planets that trade and fight wars
2012-09-20T05:42:20  <antimatroidl> but...
2012-09-20T05:42:25  <mcstar> i told him about aichallenge's past he seemed very enthusiatic
2012-09-20T05:42:29  <mcstar> astic*
2012-09-20T05:43:07  <mcstar> not a great news or anything, i just thought i'd share
2012-09-20T05:43:37  <mcstar> it is interesting that he came up independently with the idea of plant wars :)

2012-09-20T08:35:46  <antimatroidl> foot rolled over the front of my skateboard after ollieing off something
2012-09-20T08:35:51  <antimatroidl> must have hit my ass on the way down
2012-09-20T08:36:26  <mcstar> are you going to need operation?
2012-09-20T08:38:17  <antimatroidl> no, not that bad
2012-09-20T08:38:18  <mcstar> it would be gross if you had broke your ass
2012-09-20T08:38:27  <antimatroidl> i think it's not even sprained (refuse to say don't think)
2012-09-20T08:38:35  <antimatroidl> i broke my shoulder once
2012-09-20T08:38:41  <antimatroidl> took me a week to go to the doctor
2012-09-20T08:38:50  <mcstar> smart
2012-09-20T08:39:05  <antimatroidl> well i didn't think i hurt it that bad
2012-09-20T08:39:10  <antimatroidl> in the end they just left it anyway
2012-09-20T08:39:15  <antimatroidl> didn't snap, just broke through
2012-09-20T08:39:39  <antimatroidl> spine of the scapula or something
2012-09-20T08:40:41  <antimatroidl> my ass is more annoying than the ankle when i want to lie down
2012-09-20T08:41:33  <mcstar> get well
2012-09-20T08:43:45  <pairofdice> 15:36:38] <antimatroidl> i think it's not even sprained (refuse to say don't think) --- 15:37:16] <antimatroidl> well i didn't think i hurt it that bad
2012-09-20T08:44:22  <antimatroidl> pairofdice: i've done a lot worse to my ankle before
2012-09-20T08:44:31  <antimatroidl> and ankles hurt way more than the broken shoulder did
2012-09-20T08:44:39  * pairofdice points at the thinking part
2012-09-20T08:44:46  <mcstar> i just skipped over that sentence
2012-09-20T08:44:53  <mcstar> i cannot make head or tails of it
2012-09-20T08:45:05  <antimatroidl> pairofdice:  :P
2012-09-20T08:45:08  <antimatroidl> blast you
2012-09-20T08:45:29  <antimatroidl> it's a hard habbit to break
2012-09-20T08:45:36  <mcstar> i think it's not even sprained (refuse to say don't think)
2012-09-20T08:45:42  <mcstar> what does this mean?
2012-09-20T08:45:53  <mcstar> what do you refuse?
2012-09-20T08:45:59  <pairofdice> "I don't think it's sprained"
2012-09-20T08:46:20  <mcstar> but he said, i think it isnt sparined
2012-09-20T08:46:27  <mcstar> whats the difference?
2012-09-20T08:46:33  <pairofdice> Yes, he refuses to say he doesn't think
2012-09-20T08:46:34  <antimatroidl> i said didn't think
2012-09-20T08:46:37  <antimatroidl> ie. did not think
2012-09-20T08:46:40  <antimatroidl> you don't think?
2012-09-20T08:46:41  <antimatroidl> lol
2012-09-20T08:46:53  <antimatroidl> it's a terrible way to say something
2012-09-20T08:46:59  <pairofdice> Nah, I think it's okay
2012-09-20T08:47:16  <antimatroidl> it sounds so wrong when you think about it though
2012-09-20T08:47:37  <pairofdice> Well if you take it out of context, lots of things sound wrong
2012-09-20T08:48:57  <mcstar> i sorted my classes i had at uni, in a nice org-mode document
2012-09-20T08:49:17  <mcstar> i couldnt use a spreadsheet like openoffice
2012-09-20T08:49:24  <antimatroidl> which classes?
2012-09-20T08:49:38  <mcstar> all of them
2012-09-20T08:50:08  <antimatroidl> how many?
2012-09-20T08:50:12  <antimatroidl> i've done 49 units
2012-09-20T08:50:21  <antimatroidl> that's 49 individual classes
2012-09-20T08:50:28  <mcstar> 86
2012-09-20T08:50:32  <antimatroidl> yeouch
2012-09-20T08:50:51  <mcstar> thats around the very minimum
2012-09-20T08:50:55  <mcstar> :)
2012-09-20T08:51:29  <mcstar> but that took 5 years
2012-09-20T08:51:46  <antimatroidl> mine are over 5.5 years
2012-09-20T08:51:57  <antimatroidl> 8 is full time load for 1 year
2012-09-20T08:52:01  <antimatroidl> i did 39 the first 4
2012-09-20T08:53:12  <mcstar> i wish 1 class had a different category
2012-09-20T08:53:58  <antimatroidl> lol
2012-09-20T08:54:01  <mcstar> it is called 'introduction to general relativity' but it is listed as a voluntary class so to speak
2012-09-20T08:54:05  <antimatroidl> which category did it use?
2012-09-20T08:54:13  <antimatroidl> Grp?
2012-09-20T08:54:16  <antimatroidl> Rng?
2012-09-20T08:54:19  <antimatroidl> :P
2012-09-20T08:54:21  <mcstar> and i need credit for a compulsory type class
2012-09-20T08:54:31  <mcstar> not that category
2012-09-20T08:54:38  <mcstar> where is it listed
2012-09-20T08:54:43  <antimatroidl> i know
2012-09-20T08:54:47  <antimatroidl> i'm just being annoying
2012-09-20T08:54:55  <mcstar> there are different categories with diff amounts of crdits you have to obtain
2012-09-20T08:54:58  <mcstar> ok
2012-09-20T08:55:21  <mcstar> anyway, it is absolutely related to my specialization, and it is a very technical calss
2012-09-20T08:55:33  <mcstar> i cant understand for the love of god, why isnt it listed in that
2012-09-20T08:57:57  <antimatroidl> yeah that's annoying
2012-09-20T08:58:09  <antimatroidl> some of my friends had to take stupid courses to fill requirements
2012-09-20T08:58:23  <antimatroidl> because i did so many majors i more than satisfied all the stupid requirements anyway
2012-09-20T09:02:36  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i need 44 credits in that category and i have 43
2012-09-20T09:02:41  <mcstar> thats why im annoyed
2012-09-20T09:03:12  <mcstar> all the classes i could take provide 2-3 credits
2012-09-20T09:03:44  <mcstar> no, 3
