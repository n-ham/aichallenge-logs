2010-10-25T06:37:56  <antimatroid> and saving ships at some planets to counter any of those if necessary, but the moment you fall behind the concept stops doing anything in theory

2010-10-25T06:39:07  <delt0r> well if you are behind. perhaps the best you can do, is lose slowly.
2010-10-25T06:39:23  <delt0r> ie in terms of income, ships and postion
2010-10-25T06:39:27  <delt0r> position
2010-10-25T06:39:55  <delt0r> assuming no mistake as far as the enemy is concerned
2010-10-25T06:40:00  <antimatroid> it may not actually be behind though
2010-10-25T06:40:08  <antimatroid> they may have expanded too fast
2010-10-25T06:40:30  <antimatroid> but it's going to assume those moves have gone through and then send ships at us, and i'd be backing ships up based on them ending up with more growth
2010-10-25T06:41:15  <dmj111> yeah... my code is a bunch of approximations.  they are all rough enough that the bot isn't immoblized by fear.
2010-10-25T06:42:31  <delt0r> yea, my current bot is imoblized by fear on the first turn... OMG ships== and income==
2010-10-25T06:42:38  <dmj111> oh, I guess this will make more sense.  This assumption is in my attack code.  My attack code is happy to win a planet for a single turn.  In that case, even if I am behind, I may still have enough to take a planet.

2010-10-25T06:44:19  <delt0r> well rage bot on "bad maps" is pretty close to a optimal strat IMO
2010-10-25T06:45:02  <antimatroid> why would you call them bad maps?
2010-10-25T06:45:13  <antimatroid> lots of them would be maybe
2010-10-25T06:45:14  <delt0r> note the quotation marks
2010-10-25T06:45:35  <antimatroid> yeah, but why not some maps or whatever?
2010-10-25T06:45:40  <antimatroid> the bad came from somewhere :P
2010-10-25T06:45:54  <delt0r> in this case when home planets are closer to each other than basically any practical neutral
2010-10-25T06:46:10  <antimatroid> they are rather boring in that they are normally a draw
2010-10-25T06:46:22  <antimatroid> it's funny when you see someone not expand when they could have

2010-10-25T08:16:37  <hellman> is there any source of drawing planets ?
2010-10-25T08:17:04  <dmj111> you mean drawing the maps?

2010-10-25T08:19:45  <dmj111> you can use this tool : http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/visualizer/ to cut and paste game data into an alternate viewer, that contains planet ids.
2010-10-25T08:20:15  <dmj111> I have a dumb script to create maps on a javascript canvas in black and white.  If you are interested, I will clean it up and post it (but not for about 16 hours....)
2010-10-25T08:21:21  <dmj111> here is a forum post about that visualizer: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=937

2010-10-25T08:28:17  <hellman> aerique, that's cool, but i want to draw something on/near that planets. The thing is to get right image coords from game coords
2010-10-25T08:28:53  <aerique> hellman: ah okey, i just skimmed the convo :)
2010-10-25T08:31:52  <hellman> i am trying to find that code in showgame.jar, and i think your pngs will be very useful :)

2010-10-25T09:23:25  <antimatroid1> i have an exam tomorrow
2010-10-25T09:23:35  <antimatroid1> so naturally i'm working on a new bot revision, i'll be testing soonish
2010-10-25T09:23:51  <antimatroid1> it's not worrying about what the opponent does atm though
2010-10-25T09:23:58  <antimatroid1> it is using a tree though
2010-10-25T09:24:01  <bhasker> aah
2010-10-25T09:24:08  <bhasker> i forget about australia since its way down there
2010-10-25T09:24:18  <bhasker> ah k
2010-10-25T09:24:54  <bhasker> i want to see how your new bot does
2010-10-25T09:25:12  <antimatroid1> don't expect too much, my recent revisions have been terrible
2010-10-25T09:25:20  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-25T09:25:21  <antimatroid1> but i've ironed out a lot of bugs that i managed to introduce
2010-10-25T09:25:37  <bhasker> yea its the same problem for me
2010-10-25T09:25:49  <bhasker> i keep introducing regressions and revisiting rules i had put in earlier
2010-10-25T09:26:09  <bhasker> mostly though i am replacing my complex rules with simpler ones which strangely work much better at times
2010-10-25T09:26:43  <antimatroid1> i had an interesting result before
2010-10-25T09:26:53  <antimatroid1> i was losing non stop to an old bot on a map in like 130 turns
2010-10-25T09:26:58  <antimatroid1> then one go it decides to win in 200
2010-10-25T09:27:06  <antimatroid1> play the same bot again 3 times and lost in the normal turns
2010-10-25T09:27:19  <antimatroid1> guess that's tree generation for you
2010-10-25T09:27:52  <bhasker> heh
2010-10-25T09:28:03  *** Florian95 <Florian95!~Florian@alpha.fullsix.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving...)
2010-10-25T09:28:14  <bhasker> hmm though that doesn'tm ake sense
2010-10-25T09:28:20  <bhasker> unless you have a random factor in there
2010-10-25T09:28:28  <bhasker> or a timer which caused your tree bot to run out of time
2010-10-25T09:28:40  <antimatroid1> no, i think it would have just generated some nodes further
2010-10-25T09:28:43  <antimatroid1> and the payoffs changed
2010-10-25T09:28:54  <antimatroid1> or less and my tree sucks :P
2010-10-25T09:29:13  <bhasker> ah
2010-10-25T09:29:32  <bhasker> so why would t generate nodes further one time and not the other
2010-10-25T09:29:44  <bhasker> only thing that makes sense is if it ran out of time or something
2010-10-25T09:30:35  <bhasker> i ffeel good when my bot happens to beat Accoun* variants
2010-10-25T09:30:38  <antimatroid1> i have a queue of extendable nodes :P
2010-10-25T09:30:40  <bhasker> and Hazard* variants
2010-10-25T09:30:46  <antimatroid1> so i just extend for a certain amount of time
2010-10-25T09:30:56  <bhasker> yea as i said it time
2010-10-25T09:31:01  <antimatroid1> when i have a decent running bot i give them some pain
2010-10-25T09:31:03  <bhasker> probably just increase the time allowed per turn
2010-10-25T09:31:07  <antimatroid1> but not as much as they give me
2010-10-25T09:31:13  <bhasker> and see if you consistently beat it
2010-10-25T09:31:22  <bhasker> then you just need to work on increasing your speed
2010-10-25T09:31:25  <bhasker> of node searches

2010-10-25T09:31:39  <bhasker> i would say initially play with a higher timer
2010-10-25T09:31:42  <bhasker> against older bots
2010-10-25T09:31:42  <antimatroid1> problem is the longer i give it the longer the damn games take
2010-10-25T09:31:52  <bhasker> to get your tree logic right
2010-10-25T09:32:01  <antimatroid1> yeah, atm i'm just working on bugs
2010-10-25T09:32:10  <antimatroid1> the codebase is solid i'm pretty sure

2010-10-25T13:33:53  <lavalamp_> mega1 said he used some sort of minimax and he spends a lot of time on his evaluation function

2010-10-25T13:35:51  <lavalamp_> I think he said he moved it to .8 seconds to avoid timeouts on the main server
2010-10-25T13:36:21  <JamesMG> lavalamp_: how's your minimax going?
2010-10-25T13:36:37  <lavalamp_> JamesMG, dumb as rocks :)
2010-10-25T13:36:47  <JamesMG> good company then
2010-10-25T13:36:54  <JamesMG> for mine I mean
2010-10-25T13:37:00  <lavalamp_> slightly smarter than yours, it won the two or three games they played over the weekend
2010-10-25T13:37:17  <lavalamp_> I'm working on improving my move generation now...
2010-10-25T13:37:22  <JamesMG> I spent about 30 minutes cleaning up some dumb scoring function issues sunday morning
2010-10-25T13:37:33  <JamesMG> which improved it by 100ELO, but at -700 that isn't much
2010-10-25T13:37:34  <lavalamp_> yeah I saw yours went up a bit
2010-10-25T13:38:01  <lavalamp_> good news is mine does 10-20k nodes per second
2010-10-25T13:38:16  <JamesMG> nice, I got mine to about 9k/second
2010-10-25T13:38:34  <JamesMG> unfortunately it hits that with single ply and decent numbers of planets owned
2010-10-25T13:38:43  <JamesMG> so I need to work on move generation some more too
2010-10-25T13:38:45  <lavalamp_> yeah so I can add more complicated stuff to the generators.

2010-10-25T13:48:44  <Lithosphere> i think it is fine, boegel, what is the problem?
2010-10-25T13:49:12  <boegel> I was told here that the biggest fleet always wins
2010-10-25T13:49:36  <boegel> so I implemented it such that the red fleets are thrown out
2010-10-25T13:49:36  <Zannick> you combine all ships to determine "fleet" size
2010-10-25T13:49:41  <boegel> so, that must be wrong
2010-10-25T13:49:56  <Zannick> so it's essentially a defending fleet of 29 vs an attacking fleet of 29
2010-10-25T13:50:17  <boegel> Zannick: the blue fleet still wins, but it's trimmed down by the combination of red fleets, and thus no longer able to conquer the planet?
2010-10-25T13:50:27  <Lithosphere> if it's a draw, the original player gets the planet
2010-10-25T13:50:35  <boegel> right...
2010-10-25T13:50:47  <boegel> I totally misinterpreted that
2010-10-25T13:50:53  <boegel> but now it's clear, thx
2010-10-25T13:51:19  <boegel> I hope that's a major reason why my bot only gets to rank ~750... :-/

2010-10-25T13:56:48  <lavalamp_> JamesMG, actually that's just my move generator, no minimax-- not sure if the minimax part makes it stronger or not :/
2010-10-25T13:57:32  <JamesMG> How is it choosing a move?
2010-10-25T13:57:38  <lavalamp_> Nice thing about my move generator bot is that it's really fast...
2010-10-25T13:57:39  <Accoun> any one wath bocsimacko-b0.31 play realtime? he fast thiking?
2010-10-25T13:58:31  <lavalamp_> JamesMG, heuristics, sigh... defend everything you can, fortify against potential threats, attack everything you can, route unused ships

2010-10-25T14:00:05  <JamesMG> I'm trying to figure out a way to trim my node count so I can go with deeper prediction, without giving up the neat coordinated moves it does
2010-10-25T14:00:44  <JamesMG> think I will have to take away some of it's freedom
2010-10-25T14:01:18  <lavalamp_> I think its important that we only show the minimax engine good moves to evaluate
2010-10-25T14:01:23  <janzert> amstan: is there any reason admins do not have moderator permissions on the forums?
2010-10-25T14:02:14  <JamesMG> It's definitely wasting a lot of valuable time processing very obviously crappy moves
2010-10-25T14:04:21  <lavalamp_> To help keep my speed up, I made it so my defense and fortification code will only need to run once per node instead of once per move
2010-10-25T14:04:53  <JamesMG> My "Move" object is a collection of Orders now
2010-10-25T14:05:59  <lavalamp_> I did one optimization that like quadrupled my node count
2010-10-25T14:06:02  <JamesMG> but the Orders are generated without a purpose in mind
2010-10-25T14:06:09  <JamesMG> oh?  Feel like sharing?
2010-10-25T14:06:52  <lavalamp_> Instead of mapping out the future any time an order is added to the stack, I wait until someone asks for the planet's info at a particular turn
2010-10-25T14:07:25  <Zannick> lazy evaluation is useful :)
2010-10-25T14:07:31  <lavalamp_> Yes :)
2010-10-25T14:08:02  <JamesMG> my biggest optimization was to not loop through every fleet each turn step in my prediction function, oops.
2010-10-25T14:08:41  <lavalamp_> I also made it so that if the future is impossible, it will start issuing anti-orders until it is possible-- that way my generators can map out as much of the future as they want without worrying about interfering with the next layer
2010-10-25T14:09:25  <lavalamp_> I wonder how fast mine would run if I used random order generation and what it would look like...
2010-10-25T14:09:52  <JamesMG> RandomBot Part Two: The Randoming?
2010-10-25T14:09:59  <lavalamp_> hehe
2010-10-25T14:10:10  <lavalamp_> at that point I might as well do monte carlo, though...

2010-10-25T14:20:33  <JamesMG> mine just did this morning
2010-10-25T14:21:27  <Lithosphere> I added some specific code to make it always win against ragebot
2010-10-25T14:21:59  <lavalamp_> Yeah, I refuse to do that, I want it to beat the general case ^^
2010-10-25T14:22:15  * raedwulf went back to the drawing board
2010-10-25T14:22:18  <JamesMG> my old code draws against ragebot most of the time, because of some timidity code I put in
2010-10-25T14:23:01  <JamesMG> I don't want to open it up and fix it though, since it's like 2000 lines of various strategies in there
2010-10-25T14:23:18  <raedwulf> :o
2010-10-25T14:23:26  * raedwulf cowers
2010-10-25T14:23:30  <Lithosphere> well yes, it almost always drawed before sometimes it won, but 3 lines of code and it always won :p
2010-10-25T14:23:48  <lavalamp_> are you gonna keep working on your minimax code JamesMG? or do you have yet another botL

2010-10-25T14:23:59  <JamesMG> I'm undecided lavalamp_
2010-10-25T14:24:18  <JamesMG> I have a cleaned up framework from my old one with no strategy in place yet
2010-10-25T14:24:37  <JamesMG> but with the evaluation improvements the minimax one has led me to
2010-10-25T14:24:53  <JamesMG> may go to that if I get tired of minimax :)
2010-10-25T14:25:22  <Zannick> i'm going to see how well i can do without minimax
2010-10-25T14:25:25  <Zannick> and then stop
2010-10-25T14:25:38  <lavalamp_> I added a connectedness metric to my evaluation function
2010-10-25T14:25:42  <boegel> urgh
2010-10-25T14:25:52  <boegel> I hate it when my bot loses it's first game

2010-10-25T14:25:56  <boegel> gone high hopes :(
2010-10-25T14:26:09  <lavalamp_> it helped, a lot, but I think it may have just been noise since it played so badly

2010-10-25T14:39:39  <lavalamp_> mine builds a nice table and plays prisoner's dilemma

2010-10-25T14:43:40  <antimatroid1> you can do trees with imperfect information
2010-10-25T14:44:01  <antimatroid1> basically for any strategic game, there is an isomorphic extensive form representation and vice versa
2010-10-25T14:44:18  <janzert> basically minimax is for extensive form games and simultaneous moves should be normal form
2010-10-25T14:44:23  <a1k0n> hm, that could have worked for tron
2010-10-25T14:44:44  <janzert> a1k0n: right, I never though of it till after tron was over
2010-10-25T14:44:45  <lavalamp_> using the payoff matrix will let me detect if a mixed strategy is appropriate
2010-10-25T14:45:24  <lavalamp_> it seems that would be difficult in tree form
2010-10-25T14:46:13  <lavalamp_> hey janzert, since you're here-- any progress towards installing go? :)
2010-10-25T14:46:45  <janzert> sorry, not really. I do happen to be working a bit on fixing C# at the moment...
2010-10-25T14:46:59  <janzert> which means upgrading it which could easily lead to adding golang :)
2010-10-25T14:47:06  <lavalamp_> yay :)
2010-10-25T14:47:44  <a1k0n> hmm.  it's basically equivalent to doing minimax with move evaulation once every other ply, but the alpha-beta pruning rules won't work
2010-10-25T14:47:54  <lavalamp_> janzert, If you run into any troubles, let me know, I can get you in touch with someone on the go team who has offered to help if I don't personally know the answer
2010-10-25T14:48:34  <lavalamp_> a1k0n yeah I'm still trying to figure out if there's a way to still do something like alpha-beta
2010-10-25T14:48:53  <a1k0n> parts of the table could be dominated by other parts.. somehow.
2010-10-25T14:49:28  <lavalamp_> yeah I'm wondering if I detect domination before evaluating all the moves, if that will cause me to miss stuff.
2010-10-25T14:49:40  <lavalamp_> I think it will... :/

2010-10-25T16:13:12  <janzert> antimatroid1: regarding game 695902 remember that the visualizer does not show the result of the final move
2010-10-25T16:13:38  <janzert> and the last move the visualizer shows you are 2 ships down with a growth rate that is 2 larger
2010-10-25T16:13:49  <janzert> so after the final move it is a draw
2010-10-25T16:14:01  <janzert> one move shorter and you lose, one move longer and you win

2010-10-25T16:27:57  <janzert> it's been around for a few days :)
2010-10-25T16:27:59  <boegel> so, if you quickly fix a bug, you're being punished? :(
2010-10-25T16:28:07  <boegel> kind of makes sense though
2010-10-25T16:28:09  <boegel> but still
2010-10-25T16:28:11  <boegel> annoying :P
2010-10-25T16:28:15  <TravisD> It turns out that there was already a request for Groovy, so I just "voted" for that issue. Hopefully it works out :)

2010-10-25T16:28:28  <boegel> who's going to explain this to my wife?
2010-10-25T16:28:30  <Zannick> well, it encourages being more sure about your submission :P
2010-10-25T16:28:49  <janzert> even 10 minute resubmits are a bit unfair as they are much quicker than you normally should get another game :P
2010-10-25T16:29:15  <Zannick> and prevents one guy from submitting four times in a minute every minute
2010-10-25T16:30:00  <TravisD> Also, is it possible to submit compiled .jar files as part of your bot? I'm assuming it is not
2010-10-25T16:30:12  <Zannick> they are wiped before compilation

2010-10-25T17:11:18  <JamesMG> yeah, it's by far dumber than the bot I just told what to do and when
2010-10-25T17:11:26  <TravisD> hehe
2010-10-25T17:11:47  <Zannick> how many subsets do you get?
2010-10-25T17:11:51  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3814), felixcoto(3776), Hazard(3768), dmj111(3755), jambachili(3688), GreenTea(3671), luksian(3666), george(3634), davidjliu(3618), bix0r4ever(3603)
2010-10-25T17:12:07  <TravisD> You might consider looking at Monte-Carlo tree search. It's been very successful in the game of Go, which has a large branching factor and state space
2010-10-25T17:12:08  <Zannick> i'd imagine with it being exponential, that would end up bad...
2010-10-25T17:12:10  <JamesMG> best I've pushed through is 9000 in the one second it's given
2010-10-25T17:12:24  <Zannick> with how many ply? just 1?
2010-10-25T17:12:31  <JamesMG> yeah, that's one ply
2010-10-25T17:12:42  <Zannick> still
2010-10-25T17:12:43  <TravisD> JamesMG: so you do 9000 subsets per ply, how deep?
2010-10-25T17:12:43  <JamesMG> I've filtered the orders down a bit since then

2010-10-25T17:13:58  <TravisD> er, oh
2010-10-25T17:14:01  <lavalamp_> I do something similar, but my move generation is even more restricted, I think

2010-10-25T17:14:24  <TravisD> So is it really minimax then? If you're only doing 1 ply?
2010-10-25T17:14:37  <JamesMG> I have the code in place to build out an entire tree
2010-10-25T17:14:43  <lavalamp_> currently mine does 10-20k nodes per second, two or three ply
2010-10-25T17:14:53  <JamesMG> but it's far too slow to run at any meaningful depth
2010-10-25T17:14:59  <JamesMG> so I'm working on that first
2010-10-25T17:14:59  <lavalamp_> and by ply in this case, it's a move from each player
2010-10-25T17:15:32  <TravisD> lavalamp_: sp are you looking two or three turns ahead? Or like, two or three significant actions ahead?
2010-10-25T17:15:46  <JamesMG> but yeah, calling it minimax is probably reaching for a name for sure :)
2010-10-25T17:15:52  <TravisD> hehe
2010-10-25T17:15:53  <bhasker_> antimatroid around?
2010-10-25T17:16:19  <lavalamp_> TravisD: turns, although I have some (so far unused) code to skip ahead if nothing significant is going to happen
2010-10-25T17:17:05  <lavalamp_> I suppose mine is more like running a mini tournament between different variations of my move generation code
2010-10-25T17:17:07  <TravisD> ah, all these complications turned me away from minimax. Your enemy might always send some huge fleet, which is significant :P
2010-10-25T17:17:45  <JamesMG> mine at one point assumes the enemy will launch all his ships from every planet to whatever it wants to attack
2010-10-25T17:17:56  <JamesMG> it being my bot, sorry
2010-10-25T17:18:11  <TravisD> ah, pessimism :)
2010-10-25T17:18:20  <JamesMG> which results in deadlocks like the one lavalamp_ linked a few minutes ago, hehe
2010-10-25T17:18:30  <lavalamp_> hehehe
2010-10-25T17:19:32  <TravisD> I didn't realize the tcp client had a web viewer liek that :D
2010-10-25T17:20:21  <lavalamp_> JamesMG, one way to solve that is if you can't fortify (my name for preventing hypothetical attacks), don't even try
2010-10-25T17:20:52  <JamesMG> that was the intent, but it's a method I copied from my first version original bot
2010-10-25T17:20:59  <lavalamp_> ah haha
2010-10-25T17:21:07  <JamesMG> it could use a reworking to get more accurate/more data

2010-10-25T17:22:17  <JamesMG> more tree trimming I think
2010-10-25T17:22:36  <lavalamp_> yeah mine had a big appetite for neutrals right next to the opponent for some reason...
2010-10-25T17:23:45  <JamesMG> I think that's where my single ply "tree" is holding it back, it never represents consequences
2010-10-25T17:23:53  <JamesMG> so it thinks it can get away with that kind of maneuver
2010-10-25T17:25:23  <lavalamp_> yeah, because of that I decided the move generators have to be a lot smarter

2010-10-25T17:30:10  <TravisD> Sorry :P I've been trying to get a feel for the competition. Today I'm starting a more serious attempt lol
2010-10-25T17:30:24  <TravisD> is this your minimax one?
2010-10-25T17:30:49  <lavalamp_> that is the move generator for my minimax bot
2010-10-25T17:31:01  <lavalamp_> which currently has major defects
2010-10-25T17:31:01  <TravisD> oh okay
2010-10-25T17:31:23  <TravisD> yeah, I got all excited because I solved some problem perfectly (how to move ships on a tree)
2010-10-25T17:31:31  <TravisD> But sadly that's kind of useless
2010-10-25T17:32:30  <lavalamp_> haha
2010-10-25T17:32:49  <lavalamp_> it's useful, but not until your attack and defense code works
2010-10-25T17:33:12  <TravisD> well, assuming that ships should travel between planets only along the edges of a tree is a really bad assumption in most cases
2010-10-25T17:33:51  <TravisD> well, maybe not, but I can't think of a way to find trees that don't cause serious timing problems
2010-10-25T17:33:54  <lavalamp_> oh, possibly-- I thought you were just meaning unused ship routing in general
2010-10-25T17:34:45  <TravisD> ah, yeah, that is definitely useful :)
2010-10-25T17:35:55  <TravisD> do you have a bot competing on the official server?

2010-10-25T17:54:26  <n9thbit> JamesMG: if you dont mind me asking, how far into the search tree do you go or do you time limit it or?
2010-10-25T17:55:03  <JamesMG> right now it's one ply, as I work on trimming down the node count
2010-10-25T17:55:15  <JamesMG> and time unlimited because the TCP server is pretty forgiving about that
2010-10-25T17:56:11  <JamesMG> I have a long ways to go to get it to search deeper, since it nearly times out as is
2010-10-25T17:56:20  <JamesMG> and it's exponential the further you go, so...

2010-10-25T18:00:52  <JamesMG> yeah, tweaks to that have made the biggest difference in it's relative intelligence so far

2010-10-25T18:08:44  <JamesMG> watching it's games, a lot of it's idiocy is trying to take the wrong neutrals because it has no concept of distance
2010-10-25T18:09:45  <Zannick> that's silly, that should be up there too
2010-10-25T18:09:59  <Zannick> distance negatively affects the ships you gain
2010-10-25T18:10:24  <Zannick> you should use the turn you get the planet rather than the turn you launch :)
2010-10-25T18:10:35  <JamesMG> yeah, it needs to

2010-10-25T18:10:50  <JamesMG> hi
2010-10-25T18:10:53  <lavalamp_> it's not so much distance that's the problem as it is proximity to the other player

2010-10-25T18:11:05  <janstaunton> I wanna show my prowess to my uni colleagues :D
2010-10-25T18:11:13  <JamesMG> but yeah, proximity to the bulk of the other player's ships is causing issues mostly
2010-10-25T18:11:34  <JamesMG> because then it tries to save it's new pet planet by making all it's own ships airborne

2010-10-25T18:44:58  <TravisD> was kind of fun to make
2010-10-25T18:45:56  <Zannick> i can imagine :)
2010-10-25T18:46:30  * Zannick wrote a copybot way back at the beginning of september to test submitting
2010-10-25T18:47:58  <TravisD> So, at the very beginning I compute a map from Planets to Planets which stores the mirror of each
2010-10-25T18:48:09  <TravisD> satisfying linear algebra :)
2010-10-25T18:48:14  <Zannick> nice
2010-10-25T18:48:46  <Zannick> i used a slightly...more cheating hack to get that
2010-10-25T18:49:13  <TravisD> haha, how'd you do it?
2010-10-25T18:49:44  <Zannick> well, I went by the map generator
2010-10-25T18:49:58  <Zannick> 0 is always the center, and the pairs after that are (1,2) , (3,4) , ...
2010-10-25T18:50:11  <TravisD> ah
2010-10-25T18:50:27  <Zannick> so it won't work for general maps, but it works for the ones we're using
2010-10-25T18:51:23  <TravisD> I use the difference between the starting planets as one basis vector and compute an orthogonal second vector. Then I rotate all vectors to be in this new space. After that, the mirroring becomes really easy.. but you have to check two possibilities
2010-10-25T18:51:49  <TravisD> but it should work on any map that is symmetric :)

2010-10-25T19:27:54  <TravisD> The language is Groovy. I can't find the issue because my internet is being stubborn
2010-10-25T19:28:42  <TravisD> ah, here: http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=167&q=Groovy
2010-10-25T19:36:25  <TravisD> amstan: is it likely that Groovy will be allowed? I am in no rush for it to be installed on the server, but it would be nice to know that it will be eventually :)
2010-10-25T19:36:47  <amstan> there's no reason for it not to
2010-10-25T19:36:58  <amstan> it's just actually getting it implemented and installed
2010-10-25T19:37:13  <TravisD> Yeah, I understand that you guys probably have more important things to deal with
2010-10-25T19:37:35  <TravisD> seems like it should be pretty quick though. Some small changes to the compile script and installing groovy
2010-10-25T19:37:55  <amstan> we also have to get golang and c#
2010-10-25T19:38:00  <amstan> and there's a few others
2010-10-25T19:38:14  <amstan> they add up
2010-10-25T19:38:43  <TravisD> yeah, I have no doubt
2010-10-25T19:38:48  <TravisD> sorry for pestering, haha :P

2010-10-25T19:48:46  <amstan> by popular demand
2010-10-25T19:48:56  <janzert> only worriesome part is errors per minute are a little high on the servers at the moment
2010-10-25T19:49:01  <janzert> hopefully just fluke

2010-10-25T19:53:20  <n9thbit> hi, could anyone here tell me if there are memory limitations enforced on a bot? I posted this (http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=994&start=0) and Mistmanov replied posting a link suggesting there is no limit. Could any admins tell me if this is true? Thanks
2010-10-25T19:54:22  <janzert> there is currently no enforced limit, but that may change
2010-10-25T19:57:27  <n9thbit> janzert: thanks
2010-10-25T20:05:26  <eburnette> I finally tied ObligatoryShampoo, really boring game though. http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=700640
2010-10-25T20:06:15  <TravisD> Are both bots just doing nothing?
2010-10-25T20:06:31  <eburnette> First bot to move loses, so they don't move
2010-10-25T20:06:54  <TravisD> its not obvious to me why the first bot to move loses
2010-10-25T20:07:54  <eburnette> On that map the planets are too close together
2010-10-25T20:07:59  <janzert> basically you can't take a planet without making your home planet vulnerable and also losing so many ships that you don't have time to make them back before the opponent can also capture the new planet
2010-10-25T20:08:32  <TravisD> Ah, right

2010-10-25T20:10:25  <TravisD> Ah, no, I guess if you send any ships he kills your home planet
2010-10-25T20:10:39  <TravisD> and in the mean-time generates more planets than you'll get from the new one
2010-10-25T20:10:48  <eburnette> not on that map, draw is the best
2010-10-25T20:11:05  <TravisD> well, unless your opponent isn't clever enough :)

2010-10-25T20:31:30  <TravisD> Is your bot on the official server?
2010-10-25T20:32:09  <eburnette> Some version of it, it takes so long to climb back up in rankings I don't bother very often, how about you?
2010-10-25T20:33:40  <TravisD> yes, but its also old and very bad :(

2010-10-25T20:35:07  <eburnette> Cute bot name
2010-10-25T20:35:23  <janzert> is this package a new enough version of groovy to make people happy or will it just cause problems?
2010-10-25T20:35:26  <janzert> http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/groovy
2010-10-25T20:36:17  <TravisD> janzert: I have 1.7 installed but I don't know how significant the differences are
2010-10-25T20:36:45  <TravisD> there's a debian installer on the website though, if you were willing to use it
2010-10-25T20:36:45  <janzert> problem is the deb from groovy official site depends on sun-java and we are using openjdk :(
2010-10-25T20:36:56  <TravisD> ahh shit
2010-10-25T20:37:21  <TravisD> that's irritating

2010-10-25T20:38:27  <lavalamp_> only way I'm likely to get a win...
2010-10-25T20:38:58  <lavalamp_> eburnette, which color are you?
2010-10-25T20:39:16  <eburnette> blue
2010-10-25T20:40:12  <TravisD> eburnette: is your bot mostly heuristics and black magic? Or is there nice justification behind what it does?
2010-10-25T20:40:14  <eburnette> at move 30 I had more ships and more growth
2010-10-25T20:40:41  <lavalamp_> wow, I was winning for a long time here: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=701139
2010-10-25T20:41:13  <eburnette> Infernape is heuristic, I tried a minimax one but it wasn't as good
2010-10-25T20:42:04  <eburnette> Impressive lavalamp_, usually he beats me in 50 or so
2010-10-25T20:42:47  <lavalamp_> eburnette, at turn 34 he started outproducing you
2010-10-25T20:43:45  <eburnette> Yeah but I was way ahead on ships, it seems like there ought to be a way to capitalize on that

2010-10-25T22:42:30  <bhasker> oh well
2010-10-25T22:42:42  <bhasker> and i wish i could figure out why my bot keeps losing to this ObligatoryShampoo bot
2010-10-25T22:42:47  <bhasker> which is 100 elo points below mine:-\
2010-10-25T22:42:53  <TravisD> lol
2010-10-25T22:43:06  <TravisD> Elo ratings aren't a good model for these bots sadly
2010-10-25T22:44:06  <bhasker> why would you say so?
2010-10-25T22:45:11  <TravisD> They assume that the strength of competitors can be ordered in some sense. So, if A is better than B and B is better than C, then A should be better than C too... but in most cases where elo ratings are used this assumption isn't true
2010-10-25T22:45:56  <TravisD> so, your bot may be an example. Oblig. has a strategy which is stronger against your bot than against others, so we can get these "A beats B, B beats C, C beats A" loops

2010-10-25T22:49:20  <TravisD> That's another thing actually.. the strength of the competitors is changing as they use newer bots. That ruins most of your statistical significance
2010-10-25T22:49:41  <TravisD> If I beat lava's first bot which was maybe not so good, then he submits a great one, my victory looks /really/ good

2010-10-25T23:05:56  <lavalamp_> this morning I was around -550, now I'm at +50 or so, that's encouraging
2010-10-25T23:11:53  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(3762), asavis(3726), dmj111(3716), felixcoto(3707), Hazard(3681), GreenTea(3655), jambachili(3625), luksian(3621), sin_sun(3578), rsergio(3577)
2010-10-25T23:13:37  <bhasker> thats quite good

2010-10-25T23:28:16  <amstan> Mathnerd314: jeff has an archive of the old contest site, somewhere under http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~j3camero/
2010-10-25T23:28:20  <amstan> wait!
2010-10-25T23:28:45  * Mathnerd314 waits
2010-10-25T23:29:29  <amstan> there was an announcement here, with my name on it: http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/events/old-Fall_2009
2010-10-25T23:29:33  <amstan> for some reason that's gone
2010-10-25T23:29:46  <TravisD> amstan, did you have some strategy?
2010-10-25T23:30:06  <amstan> hold on, i'm annoyed at this now

2010-10-25T23:31:23  <amstan> Mathnerd314: there we go, it wasn't under events, but news: http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/news/old-Fall_2009
2010-10-25T23:31:28  <bhasker> yup
2010-10-25T23:31:40  <amstan> TravisD: are you familiar with RPS bots?
2010-10-25T23:32:00  <TravisD> I've heard a few people talk about them, but I've never made one or thought very hard about it
2010-10-25T23:32:27  <lavalamp_> how annoying, I beat accoun and immediately lost to ragebot >,<
2010-10-25T23:32:34  <amstan> there was this rps contest a few years ago: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html
2010-10-25T23:32:49  <TravisD> rofl, I'm at the UofA
2010-10-25T23:32:58  <amstan> and since this competition is ok with reusing other's code, you can plagarize all you want
2010-10-25T23:33:18  <amstan> so that's what happened in with the AI challenge in 09
2010-10-25T23:33:26  <amstan> everyone in top was using greenberg
2010-10-25T23:33:35  <amstan> let's see..
2010-10-25T23:33:43  <amstan> i entered the contest like 2 days before the deadline
2010-10-25T23:33:51  <amstan> implemented some crappy bot
2010-10-25T23:34:01  <lavalamp_> bhasker, I think we had another one which I won but it was a while ago, off the screen now
2010-10-25T23:34:14  <amstan> then i heard jeff commenting why doesn't everyone use greenberg, since it's readily available
2010-10-25T23:34:16  <bhasker> ah k
2010-10-25T23:34:24  <bhasker> what exactly is greenberg?
2010-10-25T23:34:24  <amstan> so i ported greenberg to my bot
2010-10-25T23:34:35  <amstan> bhasker: this uber bot that won http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html
2010-10-25T23:34:54  <bhasker> oh k
2010-10-25T23:35:01  <amstan> anyway... so.. having greenberg got me in top 10
2010-10-25T23:35:09  <amstan> that was cool, but not cool enough
2010-10-25T23:35:35  <amstan> i realized that i was mostly loosing to other greenberg clone bots
2010-10-25T23:35:36  <TravisD> amstan, you're at Waterloo?
2010-10-25T23:35:39  <amstan> yes
2010-10-25T23:35:54  <amstan> so i proceeded to run 2 instances of that bot, one as myself, one simulating the enemy
2010-10-25T23:35:59  <TravisD> Sounds like your student community is cooler than ours. lol
2010-10-25T23:36:11  <amstan> if i detected that the enemy was using greenberg, i went in anti-greenberg mode
2010-10-25T23:36:21  <TravisD> lol
2010-10-25T23:37:10  <lavalamp_> did you try to figure out if the enemy was ever using anti-greenberg mode?
2010-10-25T23:37:15  *** Titankiller <Titankiller!~titankill@111.92.7.71> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2010-10-25T23:37:30  <amstan> lavalamp_: yeah, i was trying to code that
2010-10-25T23:37:33  <TravisD> and then enable anti-anti-greenberg mode?!
2010-10-25T23:37:34  <TravisD> lol
2010-10-25T23:37:40  <amstan> but i realized that greenberg itself was not stateless
2010-10-25T23:37:52  <amstan> so i could have an anti-*n greenberg mode
2010-10-25T23:37:59  <amstan> i would have to have n functions then
2010-10-25T23:38:16  <Mathnerd314> this sounds like iocaine powder all over :p
2010-10-25T23:38:21  <amstan> i actually had to rename all the functions and globals for greenberg
2010-10-25T23:38:25  <amstan> Mathnerd314: what?
2010-10-25T23:38:33  <lavalamp_> lol
2010-10-25T23:38:45  <lavalamp_> it just sounds like the strategy iocain powder used
2010-10-25T23:39:04  <amstan> so yeah, that's how a noob like me won
2010-10-25T23:39:05  <janzert> grr, the new mono seems to leak semaphores worse than the old one did
2010-10-25T23:39:05  <Mathnerd314> amstan: http://dan.egnor.name/iocaine.html
2010-10-25T23:40:14  <amstan> sounds familiar: Iocaine Powder's meta-strategy expands any predictive algorithm P into six possible strategies:
2010-10-25T23:40:36  <amstan> yeah.. i forgot, i didn't actually need n version, since the pattern will always repeat after 6 antis
2010-10-25T23:41:49  <Mathnerd314> anyways... I think RPS is a foolish game. even if everybody submits random bots, you can still get a winner

2010-10-25T23:42:12  <dmj111> hellman: did you get what you needed as far as maps go?
2010-10-25T23:42:40  <amstan> Mathnerd314: but if there's these 2 people, one which submits a paperbot, and one which submits a scissors bot, you'll get scissors to be the winner, random bots all over, then paper at the bottom
2010-10-25T23:43:11  <amstan> Mathnerd314: and this was the case, since the starter package was a rockbot
2010-10-25T23:43:38  <amstan> oh yeah, i had a friend who would try to predict your random numbers in the rockbot
2010-10-25T23:43:50  <amstan> since most people were using srand time
2010-10-25T23:44:07  <Mathnerd314> cryptographic random numbers!
2010-10-25T23:44:10  <amstan> so i included in my bot a 10mb file with random numbers
2010-10-25T23:44:29  <Mathnerd314> that works too
2010-10-25T23:44:33  <lavalamp_> contestbot: tell JamesMG our bots finally played, but it's not fair because I fixed a bunch of my bugs: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=703390
2010-10-25T23:44:33  <contestbot> lavalamp_: Error: I haven't seen JamesMG, I'll let you do the telling.
2010-10-25T23:44:56  <lavalamp_> hmph
2010-10-25T23:45:12  <lavalamp_> contestbot, you have a short memory
2010-10-25T23:45:13  <contestbot> lavalamp_: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2010-10-25T23:45:14  <TravisD> these are the two minimax bots? lol
2010-10-25T23:45:24  <lavalamp_> yeah, hehe
2010-10-25T23:46:40  <Mathnerd314> amstan: a username-irc nick mapping in the bot would be good. (just another factoid database)
2010-10-25T23:46:44  <TravisD> amstan: is Groovy installed? :D:D
2010-10-25T23:46:57  <amstan> TravisD: idk, ask janzert
2010-10-25T23:47:01  <amstan> but don't bug him
2010-10-25T23:47:04  <TravisD> oh
2010-10-25T23:47:09  <TravisD> would asking be bugging? :P
2010-10-25T23:47:16  <amstan> TravisD: yeah, try tomorrow
2010-10-25T23:47:25  <TravisD> yeah oka
2010-10-25T23:47:25  <TravisD> y
2010-10-25T23:47:39  <amstan> Mathnerd314: hmm, decent
2010-10-25T23:47:49  <amstan> Mathnerd314: do you know python?
2010-10-25T23:48:45  <Mathnerd314> no0ish (I know several languages similar to it). but the functionality already should be somewhere in the code
2010-10-25T23:49:24  <amstan> the functionality's easy
2010-10-25T23:49:41  <lavalamp_> ok, night guys
2010-10-25T23:49:43  <amstan> but i'm having problems with the snarfers(the pattern matchers that trigger events in the bot)
2010-10-25T23:49:52  *** lavalamp_ is now known as lavalamp_afk
2010-10-25T23:50:00  <amstan> like... i want "who is dmj on the main site" to make the bot answer
2010-10-25T23:50:11  <amstan> Mathnerd314: ^
2010-10-25T23:50:27  <dmj111> where in the world is dmj

2010-10-25T23:52:01  <Mathnerd314> amstan: ok, start another contest for NLP in irc bots.
2010-10-25T23:52:14  <amstan> Mathnerd314: NLP?
