2011-12-04T00:54:42  <antimatroid> i mostly finished all my info stuff but now i have some weird bug
2011-12-04T00:54:48  <antimatroid> it was taking up to like 1second to output "go" wtf?
2011-12-04T00:54:58  <antimatroid> but i'm busy doing other stuff i've been neglecting today
2011-12-04T00:55:00  <antimatroid> what about you?
2011-12-04T00:55:46  <antimatroid> i settled on just recalculating hill information every time i see a previously unseen square or a hill has been discovered/razed
2011-12-04T00:56:03  <antimatroid> I had to fix up my battle partition stuff too
2011-12-04T00:56:16  <ChrisH_> just found a bug, + sign should have been -, it was making my ants go away from enemy hills in some cases. so now my newest bot is starting to beat my current bot consistently, good sign
2011-12-04T00:56:30  <antimatroid> that's good
2011-12-04T00:57:00  <antimatroid> i have no idea what's causing this, i flush everytime i output something and yet the timer is at like 25ms before the end of the turn and then 1300ms after i output go
2011-12-04T00:57:17  <antimatroid> and it only happens like randomly once every 100 or so turns
2011-12-04T00:57:26  <ChrisH_> could it be an OS scheduling issue?
2011-12-04T00:57:34  <antimatroid> maybe
2011-12-04T00:57:44  <antimatroid> i don't know anything about that kind of stuff :P
2011-12-04T00:58:02  <ChrisH_> I've seen that in my testing, especially if the disk decides to do something in the middle of a game.
2011-12-04T00:58:20  <ChrisH_> how do you test?
2011-12-04T01:00:35  <antimatroid> usually with very specific examples i've set up and outputting info to a file
2011-12-04T01:00:45  <antimatroid> for this it's popping up when I run a game
2011-12-04T01:00:49  <janzert> once every hundred turns seems pretty frequent for a 1+ second pause caused by the OS, it seems like you'd notice something like that during general use
2011-12-04T01:00:59  <antimatroid> i just feed my bot input data from a file and output stuff to a file
2011-12-04T01:01:09  <ChrisH_> do you use the --serial option when running games?
2011-12-04T01:01:23  <antimatroid> janzert: yeah i don't think it's the os's fault
2011-12-04T01:01:41  <antimatroid> i've never had that problem previously as far as i know, and it's happening at a specific point of the code every time
2011-12-04T01:01:45  <antimatroid> there's no way it's not me somewhere
2011-12-04T01:01:49  <ChrisH_> I recommend it, because otherwise all the bots in the game compete for CPU at the same time and I've seen very inconsistent timings in that case
2011-12-04T01:01:58  <antimatroid> i haven't used that
2011-12-04T01:02:04  <antimatroid> although it's playing against lefty and hunter
2011-12-04T01:02:20  <ChrisH_> yeah, not likely the problem then
2011-12-04T01:02:48  <ChrisH_> I still recommend using --serial though, in provides much more consistent time behavior when you're running the game and all bots locally
2011-12-04T01:02:55  <antimatroid> yep
2011-12-04T01:02:58  <antimatroid> i will add that

2011-12-04T01:04:28  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: whatever the problem is, it sounds very frustrating, but if it's always a specific spot in the code that helps narrow it down.
2011-12-04T01:04:51  <antimatroid> not when the piece of code between them is "cout << "go" << endl;" :P
2011-12-04T01:05:20  <antimatroid> that's as helpful as not knowing where the problem is at all
2011-12-04T01:05:41  <antimatroid> it seems to me like i'm outputting a heap of stuff and not flushing it or something
2011-12-04T01:05:50  <antimatroid> but i am adament that i'm not
2011-12-04T01:06:13  <antimatroid> is there an easy way to get my output for a game?
2011-12-04T01:06:14  <ChrisH_> that could be, but I'm pretty sure <<endl will cause a flush
2011-12-04T01:06:20  <antimatroid> yeah it would then
2011-12-04T01:06:21  <ChrisH_> use the -O option
2011-12-04T01:06:38  <ChrisH_> it will write the bot output to the game_logs directory
2011-12-04T01:06:42  <antimatroid> but if it outputted heaps before  and didn't endl it it could potentially take ages to flush
2011-12-04T01:06:50  <antimatroid> that's the only reasonable explanation i can think of
2011-12-04T01:07:06  <janzert> antimatroid: maybe just try a cout << endl; before the first timing call and see if the problem disappears?
2011-12-04T01:07:19  <antimatroid> janzert: that's a good idea
2011-12-04T01:07:26  <antimatroid> it'll at least tell me it's happening cause of that

2011-12-04T01:09:31  <antimatroid> it's definitely the cout << endl;
2011-12-04T01:11:01  <antimatroid> it's only losing like 10ms now
2011-12-04T01:11:08  <antimatroid> but that's still not right
2011-12-04T01:11:58  <AntDroid> got frustrated with my ants moving to the target in queue instead of encircling it when there is a friendly ant in front.
2011-12-04T01:12:22  <AntDroid> antimatroid: can you try C style printf and see what would happen?
2011-12-04T01:14:19  <antimatroid> remind me again? printf("go \n"); doesn't seem to flush?
2011-12-04T01:15:26  <AntDroid> call fflush() after
2011-12-04T01:16:16  <antimatroid> claims too few parameters?
2011-12-04T01:16:50  <AntDroid> fflush(stdout);
2011-12-04T01:17:22  <ChrisH_> it's been a while since I did C++, but I seem to remember that C++ streams and C io calls don't necessarily play nice together when it comes to buffering and flushing, etc.
2011-12-04T01:17:44  <ChrisH_> i thought they had separate buffers
2011-12-04T01:17:58  <rmmh> yeah they interact strangely, you might not want to intermix them
2011-12-04T01:18:30  <antimatroid> problem's still there
2011-12-04T01:18:59  <AntDroid> fflush is just a hack for the printf() i've suggested to try if the cout << endl is really the problem
2011-12-04T01:19:36  <antimatroid> i'm going to check the output
2011-12-04T01:19:42  <thestinger> ChrisH_: they sync by default (makes it really slow though)
2011-12-04T01:19:47  <thestinger> you can turn off sync though
2011-12-04T01:20:06  <ChrisH_> thestinger: ahhh, thanks for the correction
2011-12-04T01:20:08  <thestinger>     std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
2011-12-04T01:20:17  <ChrisH_> yeah, that rings a bell now
2011-12-04T01:20:19  <thestinger> but then you can't mix them
2011-12-04T01:20:26  <AntDroid> antimatroid: that means cout <<endl is not the problem, so maybe you could look elsewhere
2011-12-04T01:20:42  <antimatroid> yes, but the problem is occuring when i cout endl
2011-12-04T01:20:53  <antimatroid> which would suggest there's something not getting flushed no?
2011-12-04T01:21:07  <ChrisH_> wow, it's been over six years since I did C++ regularly, hard to believe, that was my bread and butter for a long time
2011-12-04T01:21:08  <antimatroid> i literally check the time before and after doing this
2011-12-04T01:21:12  <antimatroid> and it's using the time there
2011-12-04T01:21:12  <thestinger> antimatroid: do you have sync between stdio and iostream off for stdout?
2011-12-04T01:21:27  <antimatroid> probably
2011-12-04T01:21:37  <antimatroid> i have "std::cout.sync_with_stdio(0);"
2011-12-04T01:21:55  <antimatroid> i'd always found that made it faster

2011-12-04T01:26:10  <antimatroid> i was just noting
2011-12-04T01:26:23  <antimatroid> didn't fix the problem either :(
2011-12-04T01:26:37  * antimatroid starts combing his source code

2011-12-04T01:31:14  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: regarding your thought that a big output without a flush could be the problem: most implementations of std::cout that I've seen will only buffer a few K-bytes before doing an automatic flush anyway
2011-12-04T01:31:36  <antimatroid> i'm looking for anything wrong at this point
2011-12-04T01:32:51  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: since it only happens every ~100 turns, is there anything in your code that is only performed that often?
2011-12-04T01:32:52  <janzert> you mentioned testing with direct file input/output, are you seeing it when actually running under the engine too?
2011-12-04T01:33:05  <antimatroid> i'm not sure it's that infrequent
2011-12-04T01:33:12  <thestinger> try cstdio :P
2011-12-04T01:33:19  <antimatroid> i'm only seeing it with the engine atm
2011-12-04T01:34:04  <ChrisH_> are you writing a log of logging to stderr?
2011-12-04T01:34:14  <ChrisH_> (a lot of logging)
2011-12-04T01:35:02  <antimatroid> all my logging is straight to an output file
2011-12-04T01:35:04  <antimatroid> i can see that
2011-12-04T01:38:23  <ChrisH_> does it happen during the whole game or only in the later stages?
2011-12-04T01:39:56  <ChrisH_> and do you see python using a lot of CPU during the game if you run top or your OS equivalent?

2011-12-04T01:47:55  <ChrisH_> it sounds to me like the game engine is not ready to read your moves, and when the flush happens your code is blocking waiting for the write to complete, but the game engine isn't reading from the pipe for some reason, and when it finally does then your code starts running again and measures the delay
2011-12-04T01:50:12  <ChrisH_> if this theory is correct then the problem would be some sort of systematic but irregular delay in the python runtime, not sure what that could be though
2011-12-04T01:51:16  <AntDroid> i've seen an output in the commandline that says: INFO: invalid o x y D # duplicate order, where x and y seems to be row and col and D is direction. what does that mean? that i sent that specific line twice?
2011-12-04T01:51:28  <ChrisH_> another test would be to run the game with all bots being your code (remove the sample bots) and see if the delay happens to all instances of your bot
2011-12-04T01:51:30  <ChrisH_> AntDroid: yes
2011-12-04T01:51:49  <ChrisH_> AntDroid: you sent to orders for the same ant

2011-12-04T01:53:10  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: also a game between three of your bot could ferret out if the delay happens on the same turn for all instances of your bot or on different turns in the same game
2011-12-04T01:53:56  <AntDroid> it might be a bug then. i have code to take care of that but i may have missed something.

2011-12-04T02:01:40  <ChrisH_> antimatroid: what about the timeout test, is the delay always around 1sec? if so, set the turn time to 500ms and see if your bots timeout because of the delay or not
2011-12-04T02:02:06  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: the delay is currently down at around 10ms
2011-12-04T02:02:23  <ChrisH_> oh
2011-12-04T02:02:27  <thestinger> antimatroid: the engine does that iirc
2011-12-04T02:02:35  <janzert> are you sure whatever you're using for timing has a resolution higher than that?
2011-12-04T02:02:37  <thestinger> it has 10ms pauses between every 50 lines or something like that
2011-12-04T02:03:15  <antimatroid> http://pastebin.com/AD2ZhaiQ
2011-12-04T02:03:17  <ChrisH_> i remember someone saying the engine checks for timeout every 10ms, not sure if that is related
2011-12-04T02:03:17  <antimatroid> that's my timer
2011-12-04T02:03:22  <antimatroid> but it had larger time things before
2011-12-04T02:03:36  <janzert> thestinger: this is the time it is taking him to output the "go" line
2011-12-04T02:04:03  <antimatroid> it took the 10 seconds after janzerts extra cout << endl line just before
2011-12-04T02:04:05  <antimatroid> 10ms
2011-12-04T02:05:47  <ChrisH_> well i'm still curious if the engine is receiving the "go\n" before or after the delay, which is why I suggest the timeout test, so maybe removing the extra cout<<endl would let you test that again
2011-12-04T02:05:53  <janzert> antimatroid: check clock_getres()
2011-12-04T02:06:02  <janzert> that'll give you the resolution of gettimeofday
2011-12-04T02:06:33  <thestinger> doesn't that get you the res of clock_gettime()?
2011-12-04T02:06:40  <thestinger> I guess they're probably the same
2011-12-04T02:07:12  <janzert> yeah, I suppose they may not be
2011-12-04T02:07:30  <thestinger> gettimeofday() is actually deprecated in POSIX:2008 :P
2011-12-04T02:07:41  <thestinger> but I think you need -lrt to use clock_gettime()
2011-12-04T02:08:01  <thestinger> the engine does a 10ms pause before reading anything
2011-12-04T02:08:03  <thestinger> and then reads 100 lines
2011-12-04T02:08:04  <ChrisH_> also, if the other 50 lines of output show smaller time steps than 10ms, then that would indicate a higher resolution.
2011-12-04T02:08:08  <thestinger> then another 10ms pause
2011-12-04T02:08:10  <thestinger> etc.
2011-12-04T02:08:16  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: most of the time now the delay is happening with a "cout << endl;" line
2011-12-04T02:08:18  <thestinger> so the minimum time to output your orders is 10ms

2011-12-04T02:09:41  <antimatroid> thestinger: want to pastebin your timer for me? :P
2011-12-04T02:09:43  <janzert> and in the first 40 turns I doubt he is outputing enough to overflow the buffer
2011-12-04T02:09:48  <antimatroid> that way i can see if it's that
2011-12-04T02:09:50  <thestinger> antimatroid: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/
2011-12-04T02:10:03  <ChrisH_> if thestinger's explaination of the engine's logic is correct, then I think he has a good point
2011-12-04T02:10:03  <thestinger> I just use gettimeofday() because the new replacement stuff needs -lrt
2011-12-04T02:10:15  <thestinger> http://pastie.org/2963242
2011-12-04T02:10:17  <thestinger> look
2011-12-04T02:10:22  <thestinger> it pauses for 10ms before it starts reading
2011-12-04T02:10:26  <thestinger> so you fill the buffer, and output go
2011-12-04T02:10:35  <thestinger> it will take 10ms at minimum to read it all
2011-12-04T02:11:12  <thestinger> it probably takes under 10ms for you to do the output
2011-12-04T02:11:19  <ChrisH_> it also means that if you have 200 ants to give orders for, you can't do it in less than 30ms because that loop in the engine will have to go around 3 times to read 200 orders plus a "go" line
2011-12-04T02:11:20  <thestinger> so the engine is still sleeping when you get to "go"
2011-12-04T02:11:53  <antimatroid> i don't get what i'm calling?
2011-12-04T02:12:03  <antimatroid> what do i pass to clock_getred?
2011-12-04T02:12:05  <antimatroid> getres?
2011-12-04T02:12:31  <thestinger> antimatroid: int res = clock_getres(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, NULL);
2011-12-04T02:12:50  <thestinger> and try using clock_gettime() to measure time
2011-12-04T02:13:17  <thestinger> CLOCK_MONOTONIC isn't wall clock time, it's an arbitrary number which increases at the same rate as wall clock time
2011-12-04T02:13:38  <thestinger> CLOCK_REALTIME is the actual time, but the res is probably lower
2011-12-04T02:13:58  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-04T02:15:05  <thestinger> and you have to define _C_POSIX_SOURCE to a year/month and use -lrt to compile
2011-12-04T02:15:21  <thestinger> #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L
2011-12-04T02:15:35  <thestinger> before your includes
2011-12-04T02:15:53  <thestinger> anyway, I think it's just the time.sleep(0.01) the engine does

2011-12-04T02:17:02  <antimatroid> err
2011-12-04T02:17:05  <janzert> since you have to completely fill the OS buffers before that sleep will have any effect on this timing that antimatroid is doing
2011-12-04T02:17:06  <antimatroid> but with gettimeofday
2011-12-04T02:17:17  <antimatroid> so what is a ClOCK_MONOTONIC?
2011-12-04T02:17:26  <thestinger> antimatroid: are you using -lrt and defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE?
2011-12-04T02:17:32  <antimatroid> i have no idea what you guys are going on about with timer stuff :P
2011-12-04T02:17:47  <antimatroid> thestinger: I couldn't find -lrt in code::blocks
2011-12-04T02:17:50  <antimatroid> i'll look agian
2011-12-04T02:17:50  <ChrisH_> janzert: I think you are wrong. what if the engine has just issued the sleep when his code submits it's orders?
2011-12-04T02:17:58  <thestinger> antimatroid: add it to the end of the compiler command
2011-12-04T02:18:07  <janzert> it'll all go into the OS buffers until they fill
2011-12-04T02:18:13  <antimatroid> ChrisH_: but i submit the orders when i find them, it should happen in other places if that's the case
2011-12-04T02:18:38  <ChrisH_> but doesn't the flush block until the pipe is read from?
2011-12-04T02:18:55  <ChrisH_> if not then ignore me
2011-12-04T02:19:02  <thestinger> I don't think so
2011-12-04T02:19:09  <thestinger> then my bot would take forever to run :P
2011-12-04T02:19:10  <ChrisH_> ok, nevermind then

2011-12-04T02:19:45  <antimatroid> thestinger: i can't find the compiler command, only flags to tic box
2011-12-04T02:19:46  <thestinger>     clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &start_time);
2011-12-04T02:19:57  <ChrisH_> thestinger: why, do you flush after every line or something
2011-12-04T02:20:05  <thestinger> ChrisH_: yes, atm I do
2011-12-04T02:20:18  <ChrisH_> ok, that's curious
2011-12-04T02:20:43  <janzert> you're half right actually
2011-12-04T02:20:55  <janzert> it'll flush the bots buffer, but still keep the engine buffer
2011-12-04T02:21:10  <janzert> so 4kb of order data is probably the actual cutoff

2011-12-04T02:40:56  <thestinger> really long line but whatever
2011-12-04T02:41:20  <thestinger> that won't ever overflow because you leave it as internal types until you want the delta
2011-12-04T02:41:59  <thestinger> tv_sec is a long int (seconds since 1970 or whatever)
2011-12-04T02:42:07  <thestinger> so if you multiply it by a number, that's huge

2011-12-04T02:52:38  <thestinger> the idea is that it's the largest int the implementation could use for something

2011-12-04T02:57:28  <thestinger> you can make the return type anything that can store the max turn time in ms
2011-12-04T02:57:29  <mleise> antimatroid: the times come from a hardware clock. it is impossible that you get the numbers as 134352355235-bit integers from there ^^

2011-12-04T03:08:39  <thestinger> gcc rarely cares about your views on inlining anyway :)
2011-12-04T03:08:45  <CowTipperVirus_> I thought he was using C#, don't think it has many compiler args
2011-12-04T03:09:16  <thestinger> MyBot.cpp:133:8: warning: inlining failed in call to ‘Steps::~Steps()’: --param inline-unit-growth limit reached [-Winline]
2011-12-04T03:09:44  <thestinger> that's the default destructor for a tiny struct :)
2011-12-04T03:10:04  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah... as soon as this competition is over I'm going to put in a push request for their compiler flags... the C/C++ -o3 -funroll-loops is just retarded
2011-12-04T03:10:18  <CowTipperVirus_> seriously... -o2 -march=native
2011-12-04T03:10:32  <CowTipperVirus_> maybe... MAYbe some other flags
2011-12-04T03:10:37  <thestinger> -O3 is better for "small" programs like this
2011-12-04T03:10:38  *** analyst74 <analyst74!~analyst74@74-115-199-33.eng.wind.ca> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-04T03:10:58  <mleise> CowTipperVirus_: I've fixed the problem in the source code repository
2011-12-04T03:11:01  <CowTipperVirus_> got a sample of code I was playing around w/ where the funroll loops slows it down on my pc by a factor of 10 or more
2011-12-04T03:11:01  <thestinger> -funroll-loops is a really bad thing most of the time without PGO
2011-12-04T03:11:08  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: yeah, but -O3 is fine
2011-12-04T03:11:24  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: meh... doubt it
2011-12-04T03:11:27  <thestinger> it's just not fine to compile a massive program like firefox completely with -O3 and no PGO
2011-12-04T03:11:40  <CowTipperVirus_> gcc manual doesn't recommend it unless you can prove your app
2011-12-04T03:11:52  <CowTipperVirus_> it makes optimizations that may not really help
2011-12-04T03:11:57  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html
2011-12-04T03:12:40  <thestinger> it doesn't do anything bad at -O3 unless the program is too big for gcc to properly analyze it
2011-12-04T03:12:51  <mleise> -funroll-loops is also losing weight with the processors becoming smarter about loops
2011-12-04T03:13:00  <thestinger> yeah, -funroll-loops is often bad
2011-12-04T03:13:17  <thestinger> if you compile with PGO, gcc will unroll loops where it's a good thing
2011-12-04T03:13:24  <thestinger> you shouldn't ever explicitly enable it without testing
2011-12-04T03:13:27  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah, I agree w/ the link, but some of the optimizations enabled by -o3 should have warnings
2011-12-04T03:13:40  <CowTipperVirus_> PGO?
2011-12-04T03:13:49  <thestinger> profile-guided optimization
2011-12-04T03:14:13  <thestinger> build with -fprofile-generate, run the program through a benchmarking profile, then rebuild with -fprofile-use
2011-12-04T03:14:31  <thestinger> firefox is built like that by default
2011-12-04T03:14:32  <CowTipperVirus_> interesting, never heard of that... will have to look into it :)
2011-12-04T03:14:45  <thestinger> it lets the compiler actually see which branches are taken most
2011-12-04T03:14:48  <thestinger> which code is hot/cold
2011-12-04T03:14:55  <mleise> I recently see more and more software use -O3 in the make file. Sounds like it is stable now and doing more good than bad on the average. Or people really just want to write -O9999 and not care about the consequences.
2011-12-04T03:14:55  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah, makes tons of sense
2011-12-04T03:14:58  <thestinger> which functions should be inlined, which loops to unroll
2011-12-04T03:15:03  <thestinger> like a JIT, but compiled ahead of time
2011-12-04T03:15:24  <thestinger> mleise: anything over -O3 is meaningless with gcc
2011-12-04T03:15:39  <CowTipperVirus_> lol, yeah... :) has the - - -omg_just_go_fast look to it
2011-12-04T03:15:43  <mleise> I tried PGO once and it *failed*. The program became slower than without PGO.
2011-12-04T03:15:43  <thestinger> with clang -O4 is basically an alias for '-O3 -flto'
2011-12-04T03:16:02  <thestinger> mleise: which compiler?
2011-12-04T03:16:07  <thestinger> I think gcc just got it with 4.6
2011-12-04T03:16:33  <CowTipperVirus_> but yeah... the ai challenge has a bunch of retarded flags set, big bummer
2011-12-04T03:16:43  <CowTipperVirus_> and of all the flags, seriously... not setting march
2011-12-04T03:16:45  <mleise> thestinger: some older version of gcc
2011-12-04T03:16:57  <thestinger> oh
2011-12-04T03:17:14  <CowTipperVirus_> if I had noticed earlier in the competition I would have requested a change, but so far in I think it would be too big of a change for them to do anything
2011-12-04T03:17:16  <thestinger> sorry, link-time optimization first appeared in 4.6
2011-12-04T03:17:18  <thestinger> I got confused xD
2011-12-04T03:17:55  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: -O3 is definitely sane for a small program, but the way they compile isn't very good
2011-12-04T03:17:58  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@man-208-200.pks.muni.cz> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2011-12-04T03:18:01  <mleise> are link time optimizations part of ld then?
2011-12-04T03:18:05  <thestinger> well
2011-12-04T03:18:08  <mleise> or part of g++
2011-12-04T03:18:21  <thestinger> when gcc compiles a .o, it loses all the internal representation
2011-12-04T03:18:29  <thestinger> so you don't get optimization for your whole program
2011-12-04T03:18:41  <thestinger> a function in one .o cannot be inlined into another, or changed based on what happens in other files
2011-12-04T03:18:50  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: k, I'll let you have that one
2011-12-04T03:19:08  <thestinger> with -flto, it basically keeps all the information in the .o so it can do optimization across the whole program
2011-12-04T03:19:43  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: -funroll-loops is a bad idea though
2011-12-04T03:19:44  <mleise> You know what is funny? That byte-code languages now have features that make them faster than native compiled languages. Like devirtualizing method calls
2011-12-04T03:19:59  <thestinger> that's what PGO is for :)
2011-12-04T03:20:36  *** Palmik <Palmik!~palmik@man-208-200.pks.muni.cz> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-04T03:20:44  <thestinger> I'm sure JIT compilers will eventually be faster than AOT ones though, because you can't just distribute your code with -march=native
2011-12-04T03:20:54  <mleise> that's interesting. we need that stuff in D some day ;)
2011-12-04T03:21:11  <thestinger> llvm actually has a JIT, so there's a C++ JIT/REPL now
2011-12-04T03:21:23  <thestinger> http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling
2011-12-04T03:22:31  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: if people want -funroll-loops they can actually enable it with a pragma
2011-12-04T03:22:46  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas.html
2011-12-04T03:23:04  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: I agree... which is why I'm going to try and get them to change it in the next competition
2011-12-04T03:23:18  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: because I can't "un-enable" it very easily
2011-12-04T03:23:23  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: are you using C++?
2011-12-04T03:23:30  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: yeah
2011-12-04T03:23:33  <thestinger> it's not enabled for the C++11 build
2011-12-04T03:23:38  <thestinger> just switch your extension to .cpp
2011-12-04T03:23:47  *** epicmonkey <epicmonkey!~epicmonke@178.130.5.103> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-04T03:23:54  <thestinger> and use -std=c++0x locally
2011-12-04T03:24:12  <thestinger> or -std=c++11 if you're using gcc 4.7 like I am :)
2011-12-04T03:24:34  <thestinger> and clang 3.0
2011-12-04T03:24:43  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: didn't even think to try that... good workaround. for now I just changed my code so the compiler wouldn't figure out the size of the loop at compile time
2011-12-04T03:24:45  <mleise> maybe he uses MSVC++?
2011-12-04T03:25:01  <mleise> CowTipperVirus_: YOU DID WHAT?
2011-12-04T03:25:05  <thestinger> well, C++03 will still compile as C++11
2011-12-04T03:25:15  <thestinger> unless you actually use 'auto' with the old meaning
2011-12-04T03:25:25  <CowTipperVirus_> mleise: well... the funroll-loops was owning it
2011-12-04T03:25:34  <CowTipperVirus_> can't unroll something if you don't know what it is :)
2011-12-04T03:25:35  <mleise> hmm. ok.
2011-12-04T03:25:50  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: you an also use a pragma to disable it
2011-12-04T03:26:03  <mleise> -fno-unroll-loops ?
2011-12-04T03:26:09  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-04T03:26:12  <thestinger> you use the optimize pragma
2011-12-04T03:26:18  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: looked into that, was pretty sure the cl flag would override it
2011-12-04T03:26:19  <pairofdice> ...you can just upload your own makefile
2011-12-04T03:26:32  <thestinger> pairofdice: no, the server doesn't use your Makefile
2011-12-04T03:26:33  <pairofdice> Can't you?
2011-12-04T03:26:34  <CowTipperVirus_> pairofdice: doesn't matter... look at their code, won't use your makefile
2011-12-04T03:26:58  <thestinger> they compile each file into a .o with -O3, then link it together with -O2
2011-12-04T03:26:58  <pairofdice> Weird, it's said on the website that it should use one if provided
2011-12-04T03:27:14  <CowTipperVirus_> nice! can you provide a link?
2011-12-04T03:27:21  <CowTipperVirus_> would love to get them to do that
2011-12-04T03:27:26  <thestinger> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py#L320
2011-12-04T03:27:29  <CowTipperVirus_> lol, ofc...then people would do the thread
2011-12-04T03:27:53  <CowTipperVirus_> what's command -parallelize-loops or something
2011-12-04T03:28:05  <thestinger> just use a .cpp extension and it won't use -funroll-loops :P
2011-12-04T03:28:53  <thestinger> or push no-unroll-loops onto the optimize stack
2011-12-04T03:29:12  <CowTipperVirus_> wow... wtf, that's the only diff between the two languages
2011-12-04T03:29:19  <CowTipperVirus_> seriously... why would they be different???
2011-12-04T03:29:38  <thestinger> well, using -funroll-loops was a bad idea
2011-12-04T03:29:50  <thestinger> but maybe they don't want to change it before the next contest
2011-12-04T03:29:56  <thestinger> but they didn't use it for the new C++11 option
2011-12-04T03:30:13  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah, and I'm not going to petition for that... because of that exact reason
2011-12-04T03:30:15  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah
2011-12-04T03:30:40  <thestinger> iirc, amstan said they are going to make C++11 and C99 the default for the next contest anyway
2011-12-04T03:30:45  <CowTipperVirus_> how can your code push something on the optimize stack or override cl options anyway?
2011-12-04T03:31:10  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Specific-Option-Pragmas.html <- like that
2011-12-04T03:32:25  <thestinger> #pragma GCC optimize ("no-unroll-loops")
2011-12-04T03:32:26  <thestinger> I think
2011-12-04T03:32:29  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: cool... thanks
2011-12-04T03:32:55  <thestinger> test it though, you might also have to push it
2011-12-04T03:32:59  <thestinger> you can also set a global optimization level
2011-12-04T03:33:22  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: will def look into that to see if it helps.  doubt it'll get much saving from letting the compiler know the loop time, but worth a shot
2011-12-04T03:33:31  <thestinger> #pragma GCC optimize ("O2")
2011-12-04T03:33:39  <thestinger> etc.
2011-12-04T03:33:45  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: now I'm almost positive that'll get overriden
2011-12-04T03:33:49  <CowTipperVirus_> ridden*
2011-12-04T03:33:55  <thestinger> #pragma GCC push_options
2011-12-04T03:33:57  <thestinger> #pragma GCC optimize ("O0")
2011-12-04T03:33:59  <thestinger> like that
2011-12-04T03:34:02  <thestinger> I think you need both lines
2011-12-04T03:34:11  <thestinger> then you can #pragma GCC pop_options to undo them
2011-12-04T03:34:23  <thestinger> so you can set per-function, per-block, etc. optimization
2011-12-04T03:35:00  <CowTipperVirus_> wow, have to be pretty hardcore to profile that much of your code
2011-12-04T03:35:57  <thestinger> http://stackoverflow.com/a/2188780 there's also that
2011-12-04T03:36:13  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: well, in the linux kernel they use the gcc attributes _everywhere_
2011-12-04T03:36:16  <thestinger> and profile everything
2011-12-04T03:36:53  <thestinger> #define likely(x)       __builtin_expect((x),1)
2011-12-04T03:36:55  <thestinger> #define unlikely(x)     __builtin_expect((x),0)
2011-12-04T03:37:04  <thestinger> and then you tell the compiler if a condition will be likely or unlikely
2011-12-04T03:37:10  <thestinger> if (likely(some_condition)) { }
2011-12-04T03:37:21  <thestinger> obviously need to profile
2011-12-04T03:37:41  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah... way too much work
2011-12-04T03:38:07  <CowTipperVirus_> I could see it mattering there though
2011-12-04T03:38:47  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/X86-Built_002din-Functions.html#X86-Built_002din-Functions
2011-12-04T03:39:02  <thestinger> that lets you use SSE vector stuff, etc.
2011-12-04T03:40:16  <thestinger> http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Other-Builtins.html
2011-12-04T03:40:30  <thestinger> prefetching stuff to cache, etc.
2011-12-04T03:40:55  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah, my understanding is those should come automatically if you allow march compiler options
2011-12-04T03:40:59  <pairofdice> Looks like xathis is about to lose #1
2011-12-04T03:41:21  <thestinger> CowTipperVirus_: compilers are still really bad at vectorization
2011-12-04T03:41:23  <CowTipperVirus_> pairofdice: oh noes... he'll have to write v2
2011-12-04T03:41:26  <CowTipperVirus_> lol
2011-12-04T03:41:28  <pairofdice> heh
2011-12-04T03:41:52  <thestinger> like x86_64 implies a level of SSE support
2011-12-04T03:42:13  <thestinger> but you still have to do it manually if you actually want it to be used for stuff other than memset, etc.
2011-12-04T03:42:22  <thestinger> maybe clang will be better
2011-12-04T03:42:41  <thestinger> clang/llvm still make slower code than gcc most of the time though :)
2011-12-04T03:42:57  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah... I'm an electrical engineer by trade, power electronics, mostly the hardware and controls side
2011-12-04T03:43:14  <CowTipperVirus_> the latter forces me to dabble in code occasionally, not my main job though, and others are way better at it
2011-12-04T03:43:26  <CowTipperVirus_> anyway, writing code for a dsp I have to do stupid shit like that all the time
2011-12-04T03:43:48  <CowTipperVirus_> the compilers are insanely bad at optimizing on those things
2011-12-04T03:44:06  <ChrisH_> pairofdice: yeah, I think pguillory will pass him soon.
2011-12-04T03:45:24  <thestinger> I haven't really bothered trying to optimize at all yet beyond changing my algorithms
2011-12-04T03:46:03  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah, realistically I'm not taking much of a penalty, so I don't care
2011-12-04T03:46:12  <thestinger> I'm lazy, so I'm just using std::unordered_set, std::unordered_map, 2D std::vector, etc. everywhere
2011-12-04T03:46:16  <CowTipperVirus_> but the loops thing... omg... like I said, 10x - 20x is noticable
2011-12-04T03:46:39  <thestinger> yeah, it slows down my bot a lot too
2011-12-04T03:46:58  <CowTipperVirus_> the std::vector is actually really fast if you compile w/ the -no-exceptions flag
2011-12-04T03:47:02  <CowTipperVirus_> err -fno-?
2011-12-04T03:47:07  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-04T03:47:12  <thestinger> well
2011-12-04T03:47:33  <thestinger> the thing is that I could have a 2D array as a big block of memory
2011-12-04T03:47:46  <thestinger> and instead I have pointers to arrays, which probably slows it down a lot
2011-12-04T03:48:05  <thestinger> because I'm not resizing any of the arrays
2011-12-04T03:48:17  <CowTipperVirus_> if it's known at compile time, that should go away in optimizations I'd assume
2011-12-04T03:48:26  <thestinger> it doesn't
2011-12-04T03:48:40  <thestinger> gcc won't change container types/semantics
2011-12-04T03:48:49  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah... I'm also allocating a bunch of arrays on the heap, might be able to drop some on the stack for performance
2011-12-04T03:49:02  <CowTipperVirus_> dunno... may actually hurt me
2011-12-04T03:49:05  <thestinger> well I would still put them on the heap
2011-12-04T03:49:17  <thestinger> but as a 1D array with row * cols + col indexing
2011-12-04T03:49:21  <thestinger> instead of pointers to arrays
2011-12-04T03:49:28  <CowTipperVirus_> yeah
2011-12-04T03:49:28  <ChrisH_> pairofdice: pguillory should get another game in about 45 minutes, and I'm expecting one in about 30, so it should be interesting to see what happens
2011-12-04T03:49:42  <pairofdice> Yeah
2011-12-04T03:50:02  <pairofdice> You both have higher mu than xathis
2011-12-04T03:50:06  <ChrisH_> xathis's last game was the same as mine, so he's due in 30 mins also
2011-12-04T03:50:09  <CowTipperVirus_> thestinger: thanks for the convo, out for the night
2011-12-04T03:50:13  <thestinger> cya
2011-12-04T03:50:27  <CowTipperVirus_> sweet, g'luck ChrisH
2011-12-04T03:50:43  <ChrisH_> i think my bot is about equal or slightly worse than xathis right now, but pguillory is clearly better, it's just a matter of time
2011-12-04T03:50:55  *** CowTipperVirus_ <CowTipperVirus_!411e19be@gateway/web/freenode/ip.65.30.25.190> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-12-04T03:51:37  <ChrisH_> but who knows what xathis has been working on for the last two months. he'll probably put a upload a super bot just before finals and whip us all
2011-12-04T03:51:49  <thestinger> he's had his bot on tcp sometimes
2011-12-04T03:51:58  <thestinger> I think he definitely worked on it a lot more
2011-12-04T03:52:05  <ChrisH_> yeah, i've seen that but haven't looked at the games
2011-12-04T03:52:41  <ChrisH_> i've got a few bug fixes and improvements ready for my next version as well, so we'll see
2011-12-04T04:00:10  <thestinger> heh, pguillory is using Go too now - I didn't realize that
2011-12-04T04:00:45  <thestinger> I'm liking C++ a lot now that I've learned the C++11 stuff :)
2011-12-04T04:01:34  <ChrisH_> yeah, he switched mid stream, I saw him comment in IRC that it wasn't as fast, but he liked it was easier to work with so he was switching anyway
2011-12-04T04:02:07  <thestinger> C++11 has local type inference like Go (auto v = something() instead of v := something())
2011-12-04T04:02:10  <thestinger> and lambdas/closures
2011-12-04T04:02:18  <thestinger> so I'm not really missing anything from python/Go
2011-12-04T04:02:24  <ChrisH_> we have to do more hand optimization in Go than you C++ guys, but luckily there is an easy to use profiler built into Go that makes it easy to find the hot spots
2011-12-04T04:02:24  <thestinger> it's just really verbose/ugly :)
2011-12-04T04:02:39  <thestinger> yeah, I learned C++ for this contest
2011-12-04T04:02:42  <thestinger> I already knew Go
2011-12-04T04:02:54  <ChrisH_> cool
2011-12-04T04:03:27  <ChrisH_> I did PW in Java and it was fast enough, but syntactially a poor fit for this kind of coding, so it was some ugly looking stuff
2011-12-04T04:03:35  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-04T04:03:48  <ChrisH_> but I'm liking Go for the most part
2011-12-04T04:03:53  *** Euphony <Euphony!617e344f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.97.126.52.79> has joined #aichallenge
2011-12-04T04:03:55  <thestinger> I wouldn't be having much fun if I was using the pre-C++11 language
2011-12-04T04:04:19  <thestinger> I've ended up using lambdas a _lot_ because I don't like using classes for code-reuse most of the time
2011-12-04T04:04:36  <thestinger> well, I also don't really understand how you would do reuse via classes for lots of stuff
2011-12-04T04:06:25  <thestinger> the syntax is definitely pretty bad though
2011-12-04T04:07:32  <ChrisH_> yeah, this sort of code strikes me as more functional/procedural in nature
2011-12-04T04:08:00  <bmh> thestinger: that's because object orientation is an anti-pattern :)
2011-12-04T04:08:28  <thestinger> bmh: well, OOP is fine but not the Java/C++ style hurrr make a singleton style OOP :P
2011-12-04T04:08:29  <ChrisH_> bmh: that depends how you use it
2011-12-04T04:08:51  <bmh> ChrisH_: I am a functional programming warrior ;)
2011-12-04T04:09:05  * bmh gets paid to write Java.
2011-12-04T04:09:06  <ChrisH_> i'm a multi-paradigm guy myself
2011-12-04T04:09:06  <thestinger> bmh: I think you would be pretty amused by how I'm coding C++
2011-12-04T04:09:29  <thestinger> lambdas/higher-order functions everywhere, everything that's not a container/loop-control var is basically const
2011-12-04T04:09:33  <thestinger> etc.
2011-12-04T04:09:48  <ChrisH_> but one thing I agree on, deep inheritance structures are a red flag
2011-12-04T04:09:58  <thestinger> meh, inheritance
2011-12-04T04:10:24  <thestinger> composition all the way :)
2011-12-04T04:10:33  <ChrisH_> but i like encapsulating behaviors and data for lots of reasons, but not so much for these ai contests
2011-12-04T04:11:11  <ChrisH_> and i also like functional stuff when appopriate
2011-12-04T04:11:26  <bmh> thestinger: do you know about closures in GNU C?
2011-12-04T04:11:49  <thestinger> I thought they were just nested functions?
2011-12-04T04:12:13  <thestinger> C++ actually has proper lambdas that can capture state, and I can abuse them with references
2011-12-04T04:12:46  <thestinger> [this](Location loc) { grid[loc.row][loc.col].last_seen = turn; }
2011-12-04T04:12:48  <bmh> yeah... they are just nested function. It's neat to avoid polluting the namespace.
2011-12-04T04:12:59  <bmh> That's an abomination.
2011-12-04T04:13:06  <thestinger> yeah.
2011-12-04T04:13:16  <thestinger> it lets me have a single function for painting on radius info
2011-12-04T04:13:21  <bmh> if I can make my bot do something *other* than crash, I'm still hoping for "best Haskell bot"
2011-12-04T04:14:07  <bmh> I haven't thought of a combat strategy better than "sample until I run out of time"
2011-12-04T04:14:18  <thestinger> also it only infers the return type with a single statement...
2011-12-04T04:14:34  <thestinger> [](int i)->int { return i * 2; };
2011-12-04T04:14:37  <thestinger> that's the full syntax
2011-12-04T04:14:43  <antimatroid> thestinger: do you ever sleep?
2011-12-04T04:14:49  <thestinger> antimatroid: what's sleep?
2011-12-04T04:14:56  <antimatroid> it's glorius
2011-12-04T04:15:00  <thestinger> I'm sick atm actually, so I'm not really sleeping
2011-12-04T04:15:00  <antimatroid> glorious
2011-12-04T04:15:09  <bmh> What timezone are you in?
2011-12-04T04:15:22  <thestinger> EST
2011-12-04T04:15:31  <bmh> jeeze. (PST represent)
2011-12-04T04:15:36  <antimatroid> EST?
2011-12-04T04:15:40  <pairofdice> EEST
2011-12-04T04:15:43  <antimatroid> +?
2011-12-04T04:16:06  <thestinger> UTC-5 atm
2011-12-04T04:16:12  <thestinger> unless they move DST around again :)
2011-12-04T04:16:14  <antimatroid> EST = +11GMT == eastern standard time to me
2011-12-04T04:16:25  <antimatroid> well +10, but atm we have daylight savings
2011-12-04T04:16:46  <thestinger> I actually slept from like 5pm to 8pm to I'm pretty much screwed now
2011-12-04T04:16:48  <bmh> 'eh? EST is like GMT-5 or so
2011-12-04T04:16:58  <thestinger> so I'm pretty much screwed now*
2011-12-04T04:17:03  <thestinger> bmh: yeah -5
2011-12-04T04:17:10  <thestinger> -4 when it's EDT
2011-12-04T04:17:45  <bmh> I once worked on a financial business app. There was a lot of mucking with timezones and market openings and closings.
2011-12-04T04:17:52  <bmh> Not fun. (Praise be to Joda, though)
2011-12-04T04:17:57  <thestinger> eww, time

2011-12-04T04:22:59  <thestinger> definitely way better than my pre-combat bot xD
2011-12-04T04:23:22  <ChrisH_> yeah, combat makes a huge difference
2011-12-04T04:23:43  <thestinger> my last bot actually had .1 more skill than this one does
2011-12-04T04:23:51  <thestinger> but that's only because sigma dropped so low
2011-12-04T04:23:56  <thestinger> because I was keeping it activated
2011-12-04T04:24:11  <ChrisH_> the competition is a little stronger now too
2011-12-04T04:24:28  <thestinger> yeah
2011-12-04T04:24:31  <thestinger> tcp is a lot more intense
2011-12-04T04:24:44  <thestinger> it seems like everyone has combat now on tcp
2011-12-04T04:26:25  <thestinger> maybe it's only because they're using 4s per turn...
2011-12-04T04:26:42  <ChrisH_> maybe
2011-12-04T04:26:56  <ChrisH_> gotta go, bye

2011-12-04T05:58:51  <noctopuss> oh yes sorry
2011-12-04T05:58:56  <noctopuss> viewradius2
2011-12-04T05:59:21  <thestinger> it's just viewradius^2, so it can be an integer
2011-12-04T05:59:22  <noctopuss> thestinger: so what is viewradius2 ?
2011-12-04T05:59:28  <noctopuss> oh
2011-12-04T05:59:41  <noctopuss> why doing that ?
2011-12-04T05:59:48  <noctopuss> why just not taking
2011-12-04T05:59:54  <noctopuss> int(viewradius)
2011-12-04T06:00:11  <thestinger> because then it's not the same
2011-12-04T06:00:14  <thestinger> like attackradius2 is 5

2011-12-04T06:00:26  <thestinger> so you can attack 2 tiles away forwards, but you can also attack 2 forwards and 1 to the side
2011-12-04T06:00:34  <thestinger> not the same as attackradius=2
2011-12-04T06:00:42  <noctopuss> all right

2011-12-04T06:24:49  <noctopuss> int(sqrt(77)) will ever do 8 .. isn't it ?
2011-12-04T06:25:29  <thestinger> why would you truncate it to an int?
2011-12-04T06:26:08  <thestinger> you can compare euclidean_distance2 and a radius2
2011-12-04T06:26:26  <noctopuss> thestinger: i need to review some math bases ^^
2011-12-04T06:26:29  <noctopuss> thx :)
2011-12-04T06:26:31  <thestinger> or euclidean_distance and a radius, but that's more work (you need to call sqrt)

2011-12-04T07:23:07  <noctopuss> thestinger: thx a lot, until now i was wondering why my bot was freezing over 70 ants :P
2011-12-04T07:23:30  <noctopuss> now i know that move and see require differant distance calculation !
2011-12-04T07:24:06  <noctopuss> see = euclidean, move = manhanttan
2011-12-04T07:24:28  <noctopuss> *Manhattan*
2011-12-04T07:24:53  <noctopuss> now i can win the contest :P
2011-12-04T07:25:21  <thestinger> well, manhattan distance doesn't get you a real distance to something
2011-12-04T07:25:43  <thestinger> just the minimum (assuming there was no water)
2011-12-04T07:28:04  <noctopuss> thestinger: i'm using a* search,
2011-12-04T07:28:30  <noctopuss> thestinger: can't I say it's a form of manhattan distance calculation ?
2011-12-04T07:28:37  <noctopuss> as long as it calculates the real path
2011-12-04T07:28:49  <Conorach> hmmm, you could call it 'real distance'
2011-12-04T07:29:00  <noctopuss> i'll call it that way then :P
2011-12-04T07:29:21  <thestinger> noctopuss: well, if you're using it in A* heuristic it's fine :)

2011-12-04T07:29:36  <Conorach> because it is the real amount of steps needed to get to the destination, as opposed to the minimum if no obstacles, or the euclidian, like the bird flies.
2011-12-04T07:29:37  <noctopuss> thestinger: cool then :)
2011-12-04T07:29:54  <Conorach> but in the end it's all words until your bot actually moves that way ;)
2011-12-04T07:30:06  <noctopuss> ^^
2011-12-04T07:30:09  <Conorach> and nobody will really care what distance is used in the end ;)
2011-12-04T07:30:25  <thestinger> C++ is silly

2011-12-04T07:30:30  <noctopuss> will
2011-12-04T07:30:43  <thestinger> I put all the structs/classes in anonymous namespaces and gcc turns it into a binary with 50% smaller size now xD
2011-12-04T07:31:03  <noctopuss> ><
2011-12-04T07:31:20  <noctopuss> thestinger: a quite strange optimization
2011-12-04T07:31:53  <thestinger> well, before I guess the compiler assumed that inlining stuff would lead to a larger size, because other translation units might have used them

2011-12-04T10:33:06  <Minthos> Vetox: it's a python script, you need to run it with a python interpreter
2011-12-04T10:33:15  <zyberkiddy> play_one_game.PY ??
2011-12-04T10:33:19  <Vetox> I installed python from their website.
2011-12-04T10:33:39  <zyberkiddy> it should be play_one_game.sh or .cmd
2011-12-04T10:34:14  <Vetox> its .cmd accidently typed .py
2011-12-04T10:34:28  <Vetox> and I have python 3.2.2

2011-12-04T10:35:41  <bretep> I think you need to add python to the path then
2011-12-04T10:35:47  <olexs> python 3.2.2 wont work afaik, you need 2.6.x or 2.7.x
2011-12-04T10:36:00  <zyberkiddy> take cmd using run and then browse(cd) upto ur tools folder.. then rum manually typing name.. You can see error message

2011-12-04T10:38:42  <antimatroid> or just let my bot not perform as well on larger maps
2011-12-04T10:39:11  <Vetox> @bretep Not sure. the cmd prompt opens and closes in a second
2011-12-04T10:39:12  <contestbot_> Vetox: You have no gotten any error messages recently, so here's a random one just to let you know that we care.
2011-12-04T10:40:23  <bretep> Open cmd and go to it manually, then you're certain it won't close :v

2011-12-04T10:49:48  <UncleVasya> You tried cell maps?

2011-12-04T10:50:41  <olexs> so cell maps don't work? :)

2011-12-04T10:52:20  <pairofdice> Vetox, grrrrar.

2011-12-04T10:52:36  <Vetox> Still get the same error.......
2011-12-04T10:52:45  <Vetox> Now in feeling kinda dumb..........
2011-12-04T10:52:48  <UncleVasya> if it is his maps
2011-12-04T10:53:40  <pairofdice> Add it to path, not pythonpath
2011-12-04T10:53:46  <pairofdice> and make sure it's the right place
2011-12-04T10:54:00  <g0llum> Vetox, you must append that to path, not pythonpath
2011-12-04T10:54:33  <UncleVasya> olexs: Do another maps work for you?
2011-12-04T10:54:42  <pairofdice> Path should be a long string, just add ;C:\yourpythondir
2011-12-04T10:55:02  <olexs> UncleVasya: running it on maze maps only right now, looks good so far

2011-12-04T10:57:27  <olexs> I did a few test plays against yours earlier, mine doesn't do too badly actually
2011-12-04T10:57:29  <Vetox> Oh I got it
2011-12-04T10:57:48  <Vetox> There is already a Path Variable....I should append c:\python27 to it

2011-12-04T10:59:04  <Vetox> I get this error now :(
2011-12-04T10:59:12  <pairofdice> Figure it out :)
2011-12-04T10:59:53  <Vetox> Hehe...Done and done :)
2011-12-04T11:00:00  <Vetox> Thanks guys :D
2011-12-04T11:00:04  <UncleVasya> You don't like the speed of the server while rising. When your bot is going down, you want it to be as slow as possible :D
2011-12-04T11:01:13  <UncleVasya> Vetox: Ants Testing makes a correct play_one_game.cmd by itself. You use only the nice gui.
2011-12-04T11:01:16  <pairofdice> You can remove all but two bots and add --fill option
2011-12-04T11:01:31  <pairofdice> So you don't have to constantly change the amount of bots when you change maps
2011-12-04T11:01:50  <zyberkiddy> are those servers in server_stats page shows physical separate servers or no. of instances of games in servers?

2011-12-04T12:40:57  <bqf> if you're using python3 that won't work, of course. downloading and installing pypy should be a breeze as well though, and after that you just run "pypy MyBot.py" instead of "python MyBot.py"

2011-12-04T15:04:18  <bretep> There's a java version that is real time

2011-12-04T15:21:53  <bretep> Agreed!
2011-12-04T15:22:16  <olexs1> all the data is there, it just needs to be put together in text and prefixed with "players n, rows x, cols y"
2011-12-04T15:24:52  <olexs1> next thing I want to implement is recognition of idling enemies (timed out or crashed), my battle system should kill them with no losses given the information. maps like this one can come in helpful
2011-12-04T15:28:17  <McLeopold> olexs1: if you write a replay to map converter in python, I'll hook it up
2011-12-04T15:28:56  <olexs1> hm... my python is quite rusty, but I'll give it a try
2011-12-04T15:29:24  <McLeopold> bugnuts: it is acceptable to have a large water area, so that a tile may not ever be visible to a bot
2011-12-04T15:29:40  <janzert> McLeopold: that just looking at latest=1 isn't/wasn't a bug

2011-12-04T15:29:52  <McLeopold> janzert: how so?
2011-12-04T15:29:52  <janzert> it's suppose to look at the whole population of available opponents
2011-12-04T15:29:53  <bugnuts> I expect that will break some peoples exploration code in an entertaining way
2011-12-04T15:30:15  <McLeopold> janzert: that included deactivated bots, so the game_limit was too low
2011-12-04T15:31:04  <janzert> actually that change shouldn't make any difference
2011-12-04T15:31:25  <olexs1> is the activated/deactivated thing working properly? I missed the moment when my last submission deactivated itself after 3 days, but its game rate didnt noticeably change
2011-12-04T15:31:36  <janzert> it is still looking at the whole population to get the count for the percentage number
2011-12-04T15:32:18  <janzert> or I guess you got that in the second commit
2011-12-04T15:32:28  <olexs1> and the "n players still ahead" indicator still appeared in my profile, which I assume means that the bot was still in queue despite being deactivated
2011-12-04T15:32:38  <janzert> but anyway it was deliberate that it looks at the full population for the hard cutoff
2011-12-04T15:33:11  <janzert> in either case I now think the hard cutoff should just be removed, but first I plan to cut it in about half
2011-12-04T15:33:31  <bmh> sorry if anyone is currently on my server. I need the CPU for a while
2011-12-04T15:35:01  <Extrarius> McLeopold: Have you done anything with using 'worms' to generate maps? I made a proof of concept (generates 1/4 a map then tiles it - would need more work to allow rotational symmetry etc): http://pastebin.com/WBDkKFFj
2011-12-04T15:36:14  <McLeopold> janzert: when doing a quick check against xathis, about 7 bots were within 30 ranks, and 7 were at > 1000, for the first 14
2011-12-04T15:36:30  <McLeopold> the game limit was 1 game below the max
2011-12-04T15:36:49  <McLeopold> most of the population was at 0 or 1, deactivated bots
2011-12-04T15:37:06  <McLeopold> so this was making the game limit far to large
2011-12-04T15:37:07  <janzert> basically the soft push to even out games is working so well that the hard cutoff takes out way to many opponents

2011-12-04T15:37:25  <McLeopold> the soft push is the modified match quality?
2011-12-04T15:37:31  <janzert> right
2011-12-04T15:37:48  <McLeopold> ok, matches looked really bad, and it was the hard cutoff
2011-12-04T15:38:00  <McLeopold> I'm okay with it going away
2011-12-04T15:38:20  <Kommander> i had a shot at xathis earlier but my bot crashed in the middle :(
2011-12-04T15:38:35  <McLeopold> Extrarius: post some sample maps on paste for me

2011-12-04T15:39:25  <McLeopold> olexs1: if you are deactivated, the n players ahead will still count down
2011-12-04T15:39:41  <McLeopold> you may still get a game if you match well with someone else, just not a seed
2011-12-04T15:39:54  <McLeopold> then, if you reactivate, you'll probably get chosen fairly quickly
2011-12-04T15:40:20  <olexs1> okay
2011-12-04T15:41:06  <Extrarius> McLeopold: I have some posts on there somewhere, but I'll post some from current working version (that one is an older version)
2011-12-04T15:41:24  <McLeopold> janzert: the more even the matches are, the less difference that percentage makes
2011-12-04T15:42:13  <janzert> hmm?
2011-12-04T15:42:38  <janzert> the higher the percentage the smaller the pool of opponents to make an even match
2011-12-04T15:42:54  <McLeopold> janzert: if the 5th percentile and the 12.5th percentile have the same game count...
2011-12-04T15:43:13  <McLeopold> if everyone has the same game count...
2011-12-04T15:43:18  <janzert> right
2011-12-04T15:43:33  <McLeopold> if only we could :)
2011-12-04T15:43:34  <Wraithan> How easy is it to fork aichallenge's code base to come up with ones own competitions?

2011-12-04T15:43:58  <Wraithan> McLeopold: helpful.
2011-12-04T15:44:14  <janzert> also notice that it's the percentile number of games + 1
2011-12-04T15:44:25  <McLeopold> You must know python, mysql, php and be fairly good and stream programming
2011-12-04T15:44:32  <Wraithan> I meant, is it designed with reuse for other competitions in mind?
2011-12-04T15:44:41  <McLeopold> janzert: oops, did I leave that in?
2011-12-04T15:44:50  <janzert> that's purposeful too :)
2011-12-04T15:45:25  <McLeopold> Extrarius: import win32console? wtf?
2011-12-04T15:45:28  <janzert> the percentile is an upper bound on the number of players removed from use
2011-12-04T15:45:48  <janzert> i.e. if everyone had the same number of games everyone would still be available for play
2011-12-04T15:45:54  <janzert> otherwise no one would be

2011-12-04T17:01:25  <antimatroid> it's important to know whether a bot is going to need to work well on large maps in the final contest or not

2011-12-04T17:05:35  <antimatroid> ?
2011-12-04T17:05:44  <antimatroid> i thought max map size was 200x200?
2011-12-04T17:05:45  <McLeopold> oh, maybe higher
2011-12-04T17:05:56  <McLeopold> antimatroid: area is limited to 25000
2011-12-04T17:06:15  <McLeopold> which is 158.1^2
2011-12-04T17:06:32  <antimatroid> that's including water yes?
2011-12-04T17:06:36  <McLeopold> yes
2011-12-04T17:06:43  <McLeopold> each dimension is limited to 200
2011-12-04T17:06:48  <antimatroid> hmmm okay
2011-12-04T17:06:54  <antimatroid> is there a minimum map size?
2011-12-04T17:06:58  <McLeopold> yes
2011-12-04T17:07:04  <McLeopold> 900 area per player

2011-12-04T17:08:41  <antimatroid> so it has to be at least as wide as the view radius
2011-12-04T17:08:44  <antimatroid> that's what i wanted :P

2011-12-04T17:09:17  <antimatroid> i don't think my "painting" vision thing works otherwise
2011-12-04T17:09:35  <antimatroid> and i use translation values in turn 0 to set up a lot of stuff
2011-12-04T17:10:23  <olexs1> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=161906&user=871 aww come on
2011-12-04T17:12:20  <olexs1> can this cutoff be made like, 10 turns longer? it's not the first time I see it end a game literally 2-3 turns before a hill is taken
2011-12-04T17:13:11  <olexs1> also, "not razing hills" is a bad cutoff reason for that game, since the only hills still there have huge hives underneath, and it's impossible to raze a single hill with a hive under it
2011-12-04T17:17:02  <bretep> lol
2011-12-04T17:19:41  <avdg> just take it over, there is a way to raze a hill with a big hive
2011-12-04T17:19:44  <bretep> Do the ants in the hiv count for the 90% cutoff, btw?
2011-12-04T17:20:10  <avdg> (well, if the enemy allows it)
2011-12-04T17:20:32  <olexs1> avdg: I can't possibly step on it, since every turn it spawns a new ant
2011-12-04T17:20:55  <avdg> if it moves, you can take over
2011-12-04T17:21:35  <olexs1> it can't move, because it gets killed by my ants standing ready to take the hill
2011-12-04T17:21:37  * bretep notes if I have a load of ants in the hive and surrounded, do not let them move

2011-12-04T17:22:23  <avdg> well, they can still kill each other by taking over places
2011-12-04T17:22:26  <olexs1> every turn, one ant gets spawned. even if I let it live and move away, next one will spawn immediately, since the hive is still full
2011-12-04T17:22:49  <avdg> not if you put an ant on top of it
2011-12-04T17:22:49  <olexs1> I can still kill them all and take the hive afterwards, but not if the cutoff terminates the game mid-fight
2011-12-04T17:23:10  <olexs1> avdg: sadly, you're wrong
2011-12-04T17:23:26  <rmmh> bots should get bonuses if they run extra-fast
2011-12-04T17:23:27  <olexs1> if you watch the game carefully, my ants do step on it after killing the one ant
2011-12-04T17:23:30  <rmmh> in the matchmaking
2011-12-04T17:23:34  <bretep> Ant on top gets a collision with the new ant I think

2011-12-04T17:23:47  <avdg> raze comes before spawn
2011-12-04T17:24:05  <olexs1> then how come I didn't raze that hill?
2011-12-04T17:24:28  <avdg> did you actually move an ant on top of it?
2011-12-04T17:24:36  <olexs1> watch the game slowly. every single turn.
2011-12-04T17:25:03  <bretep> Yes he did
2011-12-04T17:25:16  <olexs1> and yet he still spawned on top of my ant

2011-12-04T17:27:06  <BenJacks1n> that's probably somewhat of a preview of the finals
2011-12-04T17:27:17  <BenJacks1n> me, pguillory, A, a1k0n, xathis
2011-12-04T17:28:49  <olexs1> according to specs, actually, I should have razed that hill. but it did not happen
2011-12-04T17:29:20  <olexs1> since raze should come before spawn... except apparently it does not
2011-12-04T17:30:19  <bmh> BenJacks1n: If I make my bot not melt, I'll see you in the finals ;)
2011-12-04T17:31:57  <BenJacks1n> I didn't mean to presume to still be in the top 10 then
2011-12-04T17:31:59  <BenJacks1n> I meant more style of game
2011-12-04T17:32:39  <bmh> I should probably start writing hill finding and combat
2011-12-04T17:32:48  <McLeopold> raze is after attack and collision

2011-12-04T17:35:25  <olexs1> technically, the hill should be razed at turn 819
2011-12-04T17:36:05  <McLeopold> hive counts are considered for cutoffs
2011-12-04T17:36:20  <BenJacks1n> not sure they should be
2011-12-04T17:36:26  <BenJacks1n> imperfect play can lose even with a hive
2011-12-04T17:36:27  <McLeopold> olexs1: if you move an ant onto another ant, that is a colission and they both die
2011-12-04T17:36:45  <olexs1> McLeopold: but I don't move on top of other ants... or do I?..

2011-12-04T17:37:30  <McLeopold> the collision happens before the attack
2011-12-04T17:37:35  <olexs1> damn it... could it really be that I move onto the enemy ant instead of killing him first
2011-12-04T17:37:53  <olexs1> crap :) thanks for clearing that up
2011-12-04T17:37:59  <McLeopold> olexs1: it's a known issue, you can't raze a hill if the hive is not empty
2011-12-04T17:38:07  <BenJacks1n> you can
2011-12-04T17:38:10  <McLeopold> as long as the hill owner doesn't move off
2011-12-04T17:38:12  <BenJacks1n> if they move off it for you
2011-12-04T17:38:18  <BenJacks1n> many people will
2011-12-04T17:38:21  <BenJacks1n> my bot probably would
2011-12-04T17:39:04  <BenJacks1n> McLeopold: were you doing the top-20-by-mu lists?
2011-12-04T17:40:09  <McLeopold> no, but I can
2011-12-04T17:40:21  <olexs1> right... so basically I need to keep one space near a hill free for the enemy to step aside and die there, and at the same time move onto the hill
2011-12-04T17:40:51  <McLeopold> olexs1: maybe, if the bot cooperates, but I think it was smart enough not to move
2011-12-04T17:41:28  <olexs1> well I need to at least give him the choice :)
2011-12-04T17:41:56  <McLeopold> yeah, I'll consider something to prevent the cutoff, if it makes sense and the other agree
2011-12-04T17:44:25  <McLeopold> the only other thing you could do is not collect food so that maybe the cutoff won't trigger
2011-12-04T17:44:35  <McLeopold> or start suiciding yourself to turn it off

2011-12-04T21:51:03  <BenJacks1n> a1k0n: thanks for resubmitting ;-)
2011-12-04T21:51:10  <a1k0n> :|
2011-12-04T21:51:17  <BenJacks1n> also re: test on all possible maps, I did make such a script
2011-12-04T21:51:20  <BenJacks1n> takes quite a while to run...
2011-12-04T21:55:10  *** BenJacks1n is now known as BenJackson
2011-12-04T21:55:17  <BenJackson> where did that 1 come from
2011-12-04T21:56:11  <Antimony> I've become pessimistic about being able to get combat working before the end of the contest
2011-12-04T21:57:00  <BenJackson> I was pretty pessimistic about my last couple of submits
2011-12-04T21:57:10  <BenJackson> not winning as reliably as I'd like
2011-12-04T21:57:27  <BenJackson> but suddenly I break into the top 10 and I'm excited about hacking again ;-)
2011-12-04T21:58:52  <a1k0n> i think i'm done with my bot

2011-12-04T22:08:30  <BenJackson> hence the resub?
2011-12-04T22:08:34  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-12-04T22:08:50  <a1k0n> this version is measurably stronger than the last one but i'm not sure whether it's the strongest of all
2011-12-04T22:09:22  <BenJackson> mine was a huge improvement over the earlier ones but despite having some variation in my own bots it's probably overspecialized
2011-12-04T22:10:26  <jab_bott> I'm worried about combat too - I've taken so long to get anything half-decent in terms of exploration and food-gathering - combat, defence, and hill-attacking seems like a lot in the short-time remaining :/
2011-12-04T22:11:54  <bmh> a1k0n: what did you change?
2011-12-04T22:12:04  <jab_bott> I'm in the middle of porting it to C and that's taking longer than I expected (my C is a bit rusty and I forgot how much effort error-checking and good memory management takes)
2011-12-04T22:12:12  <BenJackson> use c++
2011-12-04T22:12:22  <BenJackson> at least you can encapsulate the memory management
2011-12-04T22:12:27  <BenJackson> even if you don't use any other features

2011-12-04T22:14:48  <jab_bott> I wanted to use objective-c, but that's not available so I wrote some obj-c-like behaviour in C, including a FOR_IN macro and alloc/init/dealloc style functions on each object type - didn't bother with reference counting though as I can easily know at an object-level when things are done with for most cases

2011-12-04T23:14:45  <amstan> yes... i know some of these words...

2011-12-04T23:14:55  <a1k0n> many of them are irrelevant.  the idea is simple
2011-12-04T23:15:16  <amstan> yes, but i have no idea what you are saying
2011-12-04T23:15:23  <a1k0n> :(
2011-12-04T23:15:31  <a1k0n> my post is way too long
2011-12-04T23:15:47  <amstan> a1k0n: maybe add pictures
2011-12-04T23:16:25  <amstan> i remember your postmortem, i really liked that animation which showed who could get to certain squares the fastest
2011-12-04T23:17:06  <a1k0n> yeah, like ben's too on the forums
