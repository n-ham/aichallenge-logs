2010-12-29T23:52:21  <amstan> jmcarthur: antimatroid: how about disallowing uploads for a few time periods during the competition?
2010-12-29T23:52:52  <amstan> to encourage actual machine learning
2010-12-29T23:53:00  <amstan> see how the bot does on its own without being uploaded
2010-12-29T23:54:11  <janzert1> unless it is changed to give the bots some permanent storage there can't be any learning overtime by an entry?
2010-12-29T23:54:17  *** janzert1 is now known as janzert
2010-12-29T23:54:23  <amstan> yes, combined with that..
2010-12-29T23:54:40  <amstan> it's just that i got some critiques that we're not exactly doing AI here
2010-12-29T23:54:56  <amstan> since there's no learning involved in some cases
2010-12-29T23:55:35  <janzert> and permanent storage raises synchronization issues between workers
2010-12-29T23:56:10  <janzert> AI is not necessarily a self learning algorithm
2010-12-29T23:57:16  <janzert> and self learning algorithms usually take much more and work in much narrower situations than hand tuned algorithms so will be unlikely to dominate a short contest in any situation
2010-12-29T23:59:15  <janzert> actually in general I rather think the most accurate definition of AI for most people is something along the lines of "any algorithm that they don't understand how it can come up with the results it does" :P
2010-12-29T23:59:38  <janzert> and once they understand it they no longer consider it AI, it just becomes a "cheap trick" :/
