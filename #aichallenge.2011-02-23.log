2011-02-23T07:06:49  <Blkt> good day everyone
2011-02-23T07:08:08  <Frontier> I think I'll display the player names in their respective colors at the top of the screen and use a bar graphic like in the game series Total War to display the relative strength (ants & scores). That is a fixed sized bar where each player color gets a share relative to their current strength. If player names become too many or too long they will turn into a ticker.
2011-02-23T07:15:03  <Frontier> Hmm, looking at the c.i. of the web site there was quite a lot of border around the visualizer in PlanetWars. I really cannot assume to have the whole screen to draw on. Maybe I should use a typical PlanetWars page as the base for my design.
2011-02-23T07:18:14  <antimatroid1> Frontier: I use the term jewish a lot, i make offensive jokes, mostly under the assumption tha tpeople realise that they are meant to be offensive and that is the point
