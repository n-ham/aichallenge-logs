2011-05-30T00:31:20  <McLeopold> Maybe later this week I can get to it.  It's low priority for me right now.

2011-05-30T01:07:16  <Frontier> I don't think so. The JVM should quit with a message at least.
2011-05-30T01:08:20  <McLeopold> Frontier: just this "Could not create the Java virtual machine."

2011-05-30T01:13:50  <Frontier> The Sun JVM I use at least says: "Error occurred during initialization of VM. Could not reserve enough space for object heap. Could not create the Java virtual machine."
2011-05-30T01:14:16  <McLeopold> That's a bit nicer

2011-05-30T01:17:21  <McLeopold> Frontier: do you still want player skill & rank for the visualizer?
2011-05-30T01:17:33  <McLeopold> If so, give me an example json and I'll do it.
2011-05-30T01:21:42  <Frontier> If you could add that info to the meta data that would be nice. I don't care much about the format there. Something like playerrank: [...] and playerskill: [...] maybe
2011-05-30T01:22:11  <McLeopold> Frontier: Your bot has a lot of timeouts.
2011-05-30T01:22:39  <Frontier> I know, that's ...uh.. a beta test bot, to test the engine.
2011-05-30T01:24:40  <McLeopold> Look at this and see how the scoring affect everyone: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=6585
2011-05-30T01:26:10  <McLeopold> Use 'em or lose 'em
2011-05-30T01:27:41  <Frontier> That's interesting, because that bot with so few ants has such a big margin in scores.

2011-05-30T02:12:05  <UncleVasya> As I can see from game specifications, it can be better do not kill crashed opponent's ants and do focuse on the other enemies. So, theoretically, sometimes can be useful to pretend crashed :)

2011-05-30T03:46:26  <mcstar> you supposed to collect points for destroying enemy ants, and since the enemy is no longer in play, you get the upper hand, maybe the only thing you have to consider is to attack in formation, but i think that applies in normal situations too when the enemy can control its ants, so this is just a corner case of a generic attack-mechanism
2011-05-30T03:47:20  <mcstar> you dont want to be "sitting ducks"

2011-05-30T03:55:26  <antimatroid1> mcstar: yes, but those ants aren't going to fight you and do little in the way of collecting food
2011-05-30T03:55:36  <antimatroid1> you might be able to better spend your time worrying about enemies
2011-05-30T03:55:48  <antimatroid1> but if you expect your bot to be that good, i wouldn't be too worried about crashed bots on the board
2011-05-30T03:57:04  <mcstar> mainly i wanted to dispel "pretend to be crashed" to be a good strategy
2011-05-30T03:58:11  <mcstar>  consider this: a bot dies, but leaves many ants behind, then food possibly can spawn near them, so they can even increase their numbers
2011-05-30T03:58:31  <mcstar> and they occupy territory, which makes passing harder to other areas
2011-05-30T03:58:43  <antimatroid1> meh, if someone wants to play dead, go for it :P

2011-05-30T03:59:04  <antimatroid1> if people tried that, it would even further rule out trying to ignore crashed bots
2011-05-30T03:59:20  <antimatroid1> the strategies people use will change what works best, which is what makes it interesting :P
2011-05-30T03:59:29  <antimatroid1> well, one of the things that makes it interesting :P
2011-05-30T04:00:13  <mcstar> it could be prescribed that every ant in every turn must change position if geometrically not constrained
2011-05-30T04:00:26  <mcstar> but thats too much lameness
2011-05-30T04:01:03  <mcstar> i have a better idea
2011-05-30T04:01:23  <mcstar> for a fraction of the bots score, the bot could buy water lol
2011-05-30T04:01:36  <mcstar> i mean for a time some of its ants could pretend to be water
2011-05-30T04:02:01  <mcstar> like a bonus in pacman or mario or whatever
2011-05-30T04:05:02  <mcstar> i must have blew your mind with my great idea
2011-05-30T04:07:18  <mcstar> n
2011-05-30T04:07:32  <antimatroid1> we could have made it so every ant had to move
2011-05-30T04:07:38  <antimatroid1> if you crash, your bad
2011-05-30T04:07:46  <antimatroid1> but it's alright now
2011-05-30T04:07:59  <antimatroid1> people have more flexibility to set up defense systems or do whatever they like
2011-05-30T04:08:25  <antimatroid1> i stoled this from someone else, but the coolest thing about these contests is you get to choose your language then go to town doing whatever the hell you like within the contraints

2011-05-30T04:10:43  <mcstar> hey i reached 200 wpm with touch typing
2011-05-30T04:10:50  <antimatroid1> JESUS CHRIST
2011-05-30T04:10:58  <antimatroid1> i have no idea what i can do, but it's not that fast
2011-05-30T04:11:07  <mcstar> i know thats not a lot but i make progress
2011-05-30T04:11:18  <antimatroid1> i don't think i even hit all the keys with the right fingers, but slowly over the years it's gotten to a decent pace
2011-05-30T04:11:43  <mcstar> i decided to use a typing tutor, ktouch
2011-05-30T04:11:48  <antimatroid1> no one can really complain about efficiency while using qwerty :P
2011-05-30T04:11:56  <antimatroid1> i love typing qwerty though :P

2011-05-30T04:13:49  <antimatroid1> inferior language then? :P
2011-05-30T04:14:10  <mcstar> of course not, but the keyboard layout might be
2011-05-30T04:15:36  <mcstar> out of curiosity what editor do you use?
2011-05-30T04:18:02  <antimatroid1> for c++, code::blocks
2011-05-30T04:18:12  <antimatroid1> otherwise, just notepad++ on windows and gedit
2011-05-30T04:18:35  <antimatroid1> code::blocks is wonderful
2011-05-30T04:18:51  <antimatroid1> i'm not a vim or emacs guy :P probably because i've never taken the time to learn
2011-05-30T04:19:02  <mcstar> i was hoping for them
2011-05-30T04:19:09  <antimatroid1> :P
2011-05-30T04:19:11  <antimatroid1> what do you use?
2011-05-30T04:19:15  <mcstar> vim/emacs
2011-05-30T04:19:29  <mcstar> i met vim first
2011-05-30T04:19:43  <mcstar> but now with lisp im using emacs
2011-05-30T04:20:07  <antimatroid1> ergh, i wish i could download information to my brain
2011-05-30T04:20:12  <antimatroid1> there are too many things i want to learn
2011-05-30T04:20:25  <mcstar> you dont need to, just read an introductory text
2011-05-30T04:20:58  <mcstar> (of course i thought about it too, but with a download im quite certain doesnt come understanding)
2011-05-30T04:21:37  <antimatroid1> same can be said for a lot of things :P
2011-05-30T04:22:09  <mcstar> well, for one im an expert downloader, and i dont udnerstand many things :D

2011-05-30T07:16:20  <antimatroid1> jmcarthur and I had a fight a while ago to see who could make their starter bot fastest
2011-05-30T07:16:21  <Frontier> I'm looking into it right now. I think knowing how many times / second you can call a certain function is important.
2011-05-30T07:16:23  <antimatroid1> i think i won in the end
2011-05-30T07:17:03  <Frontier> did you both use C++?
2011-05-30T07:17:32  <antimatroid1> no, he was using haskell
2011-05-30T07:17:49  <antimatroid1> so i should have won, but it was good for getting me to tune some things up
2011-05-30T07:20:20  <Frontier> I think I'll make the assumption that no map will be bigger than 256 squares
2011-05-30T07:20:42  <smiley1983> you mean 256^2 ?

2011-05-30T07:23:57  <smiley1983> 've noticed 124^2 seems large enough for everything
2011-05-30T07:24:23  <smiley1983> assuming you don't want more than 10 players
2011-05-30T07:25:35  <antimatroid1> i don't think we need more than that
2011-05-30T07:26:09  <antimatroid1> i was surprised when i could do odd (even prime) numbers of players tesellated
2011-05-30T07:26:22  <smiley1983> though it would be kind of interesting to see every player in the tournament on the same map

2011-05-30T07:27:34  <smiley1983> over tcp? that would change the time constraint considerably :)
2011-05-30T07:28:32  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'd be keen on upping the time limit to like a minute
2011-05-30T07:28:47  <antimatroid1> oh shit yeah, the tcp engine shouldn't be making bots make their moves sequentially
2011-05-30T07:28:55  <antimatroid1> that would be a disaster time wise
2011-05-30T07:30:10  <Frontier> i bet you'll see a lot of disconnects when each turn takes a minute, lol

2011-05-30T10:53:51  <bhasker> and before yo make move check if ant is there
2011-05-30T10:53:56  <bhasker> if so dont make that move
2011-05-30T10:54:13  <bhasker> in makemove just check if an ant is already at destination if so dont move
2011-05-30T10:55:50  <hjax> my current strategy for anti suicide is the following: add every move to a list of moves made that turn, if theres already been a move to that spot then dont move
2011-05-30T10:57:24  <bhasker> so that shoudl workd
2011-05-30T10:59:23  <hjax> i the code that should be doing that is broken atm

2011-05-30T12:01:04  <McLeopold> maybe not
2011-05-30T12:01:11  <amstan> so no sandbox?
2011-05-30T12:01:22  <McLeopold> we do need sandbox
2011-05-30T12:01:28  <amstan> why?
2011-05-30T12:01:38  <amstan> well... it'll be fake, right?
2011-05-30T12:01:53  <McLeopold> no, it does the bot communication
2011-05-30T12:01:57  <McLeopold> with or without jails
2011-05-30T12:02:01  <amstan> ok
2011-05-30T12:02:56  <amstan> well.. i'll go make a makefile
2011-05-30T12:03:32  <McLeopold> what about the relative imports?  are you going to sed the files?
2011-05-30T12:04:26  <amstan> we have to change them so they detect
2011-05-30T12:04:28  <amstan> but.. no
2011-05-30T12:04:32  <amstan> nvm, they should work as is now
2011-05-30T12:04:43  <amstan> since we're just adding to the search path
2011-05-30T12:04:48  <McLeopold> good point
2011-05-30T12:05:07  <amstan> hmm.. is there a way to make cp work like this: cp: cannot copy a directory, `../..', into itself, `.'
2011-05-30T12:05:10  <McLeopold> I could still trap an importerror and only modify the syspath on that
2011-05-30T12:05:22  <amstan> as in.. ignore the recursive part but copy everything else
2011-05-30T12:05:34  <McLeopold> there is an exclude I think
2011-05-30T12:06:35  <McLeopold> try --no-clobber

2011-05-30T12:11:20  <computerwiz_222> o      "- *.o" would exclude all names matching *.o
2011-05-30T12:13:55  <janzert> I would just move engine.py back into ants. There's nothing in worker that uses it directly right?
2011-05-30T12:14:10  <McLeopold> but it is not specific to ants
2011-05-30T12:14:12  <janzert> sandbox is a little unfortunate
2011-05-30T12:14:17  <McLeopold> it can be used for any game
2011-05-30T12:14:29  <janzert> the whole repository is specific to ants ;)
2011-05-30T12:14:42  <McLeopold> putting ants into worker makes more sense to me
2011-05-30T12:14:54  <McLeopold> then you could have a different game in there as well and switch
2011-05-30T12:15:23  <janzert> not without a whole lot of other refactoring
2011-05-30T12:15:39  <McLeopold> like what?
2011-05-30T12:15:57  <janzert> nothing is aware of multiple games at present
2011-05-30T12:16:08  <McLeopold> so, let
2011-05-30T12:16:20  <McLeopold> s not exclude the possibility
2011-05-30T12:16:25  <janzert> it's all YAGNI
2011-05-30T12:16:36  <McLeopold> I is going to need it for TCP
2011-05-30T12:17:15  <McLeopold> when we have multiple contest at the same time, we will need it
2011-05-30T12:17:57  <janzert> I think that's a full rewrite into the future anyway, at the very least :/
2011-05-30T12:18:04  <McLeopold> ok
2011-05-30T12:18:46  <janzert> i.e. I'm not sold on multiple contests ever
2011-05-30T12:19:33  <McLeopold> I'm more thinking that we should allow for people to attempt to beat past winners at the different games.  Sort of like running a king of the hill server.  But not a full contest.

2011-05-30T13:15:54  <jmcarthur> :\
2011-05-30T13:16:18  <jmcarthur> it's pretty hard to determine the skill level of a game from just a few early bots
2011-05-30T13:16:39  <McLeopold> just the fact that the starter bots aren't sucking makes me worried
2011-05-30T13:16:53  <McLeopold> plus, everyone is being dragged down
2011-05-30T13:17:25  <McLeopold> the highest is just above 50
2011-05-30T13:18:12  <hjax> shouldnt the average skill be 50?
2011-05-30T13:18:27  <McLeopold> that's what I thought

2011-05-30T13:24:34  <UncleVasya> Visualizer uses this as background: var COLOR_SAND = '#532'; What format is it? I have found only  these notations of colors: 1. #DF01D7 and 2. [123;145;154] in web at my first attempt. Do you have a link to the page where I can see the correspondence beetwen this notation and colors?
2011-05-30T13:24:39  <McLeopold> aeter: did you submit the bot to the beta server?
2011-05-30T13:24:57  <jmcarthur> UncleVasya: that usually means the same thing as #503020

2011-05-30T13:25:21  <jmcarthur> yeah because #FFF = #FFFFFF
2011-05-30T13:25:24  <aeter> but it may be failing against the test checks, if it compiles

2011-05-30T13:42:01  <aeter> in order to be able to fix it

2011-05-30T13:51:24  <aeter> the code has some bugs though, nevertheless the checks
2011-05-30T13:51:51  <aeter> oh, the timeout may not be so good :)
2011-05-30T13:51:51  <McLeopold> I'm out for awhile

2011-05-30T14:53:27  <antimatroid1> berak: the symmetry is tesselations on a torus
2011-05-30T14:53:43  <antimatroid1> you have to turn symmetric food spawning on manually atm
2011-05-30T14:54:51  <UncleVasya> So he's going to wake up soon and will come here :)
2011-05-30T14:55:00  <berak> ahh, shure, i'll try that tomorrow ( lots of engine/game options to explore..)
2011-05-30T14:55:40  <antimatroid1> for the record, in my unofficial opinion, i expect only symmetric maps with symmetric spawning to be used in the end
2011-05-30T14:55:49  <antimatroid1> it's too noisy random otherwise, like you said :)
2011-05-30T14:56:37  <berak> antimatroid, now how would you measure that ?
2011-05-30T14:56:57  <antimatroid1> we considered trying to test the "fairness" of asymmetric maps based on past game data
2011-05-30T14:57:13  <antimatroid1> but we wouldn't have enough data and it's kind of pointless of the food spawning isn't consistent either
2011-05-30T14:58:01  <antimatroid1> it's also hard to do fair asymmetric food spawning, and i don't like tampering too much with the selection of squares to spawn on
2011-05-30T15:01:19  <berak> ever seen 'zoo' (peter greenaway) ?, it's all about symmetry..

2011-05-30T15:38:22  <amstan> example: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/visualizer.php?game=7300
2011-05-30T15:38:27  <amstan> frontier keeps getting new ants
2011-05-30T15:38:52  <janzert> I've got a minute or two anyway
2011-05-30T15:39:22  <jbroman> amstan: I thought that was how it was intended: bots make no moves but rules otherwise apply as normal. I didn't follow too closely, though.
2011-05-30T15:39:35  <amstan> seems kinda weird
2011-05-30T15:51:29  <mcstar> berak: garetti the surfer?
2011-05-30T15:52:08  <mcstar> those graphs seem like the projections of E8
2011-05-30T15:52:26  <berak> yeah
2011-05-30T15:52:47  <mcstar> i bet it will turn out bullshit
2011-05-30T15:53:00  <mcstar> thats my expert opinion :D
2011-05-30T15:54:45  <berak> ;) but  the idesa of applying 'rotations' to a given  idea(e8) rocked!
2011-05-30T15:55:29  <mcstar> well its nice, but the connection to physics remain unproven i think
2011-05-30T15:56:40  <berak> again, i'm just trolling, nevermind
2011-05-30T15:58:56  <amstan> janzert: i wanted to get a second worker going, and maybe fix the sandbox issues while we're at it
2011-05-30T15:59:12  <amstan> janzert: i was thinking to use the host i have at home
2011-05-30T16:01:16  <antimatroid1> amstan: yes, crashed bots ants can still collect food
2011-05-30T16:01:52  <antimatroid1> the idea of leaving those ants is to try to minimise the advantage the neighbouring bots get over everyone else
2011-05-30T16:02:04  <antimatroid1> they still need to go and kill all those ants if they want the territory properly
2011-05-30T16:02:14  <amstan> ic
2011-05-30T16:02:16  <amstan> ok

2011-05-30T16:35:13  <aeter> question - in my starter package, the bot is rather suicidal - the MY_ANTS pile on top of each other easily,and then die. Should this be left for the players to improve (it's 2-3 lines of code)?
2011-05-30T16:37:29  <aeter> btw, it's my first bot submission and from what I've seen so far the game is just awesome!

2011-05-30T17:23:19  <contestbot> McLeopold: Yes master!
2011-05-30T17:27:40  <McLeopold> amstan: with dead bots spawning new ant, the idea is to also make it impossible to tell the difference between a dead bot and one that just doesn't move.  It makes it more fair the the remaining live bots.

2011-05-30T18:51:04  <hjax> Frontier: its still doing it :/
2011-05-30T18:51:16  <Frontier> amstan: I can boot into Window, but I can only check IE 9 there, which is arguably standards conformant. IE 8 and below are something different :)

2011-05-30T18:55:41  <Frontier> what is the setting called?
2011-05-30T18:55:50  <hjax> chrome has an option to gpu accelerate canvas, it was causing the bug

2011-05-30T18:56:58  <Frontier> ok, that is something others may try as well. it's good to know. maybe i can work around that bug somehow when i have this shiny new version of chrome

2011-05-30T19:57:11  <Frontier> It needs to compile a lot of libs first... maybe in 2 hours everything is compiled. Ah you gotta love Gentoo
2011-05-30T19:57:53  <Frontier> sometimes my laptop overheats and clocks the cpu down to 800 mhz during compiles. need to put it in my refrigerator

2011-05-30T20:01:40  <Frontier> no it is compiling www-client/chromium-13.0.772.0-r1 ... that will take a while, but under an hour I guess.
2011-05-30T20:02:37  <hjax> Frontier how does that chip produce so much heat? my i7 runs 4 cores (8 with HT) at 1.6 ghz :/. 2.8ghz turbo

2011-05-30T20:04:09  <Frontier> It is a notebook. You have to keep the air outlet free from obstacles and the heatpipe can only do so much.

2011-05-30T20:13:58  <amstan> aww man!
2011-05-30T20:14:04  <amstan> tall grass is not in 1.6
2011-05-30T20:14:13  <amstan> well. it is, but now in the chunks that we have
2011-05-30T20:14:18  <Frontier> did you do that computerwiz_222?
2011-05-30T20:14:32  <computerwiz_222> Frontier: also, idk how old your laptop is but a can of compressed air lowered the maxed out temp on my HP from 80C to 73C (same task)
2011-05-30T20:14:46  <computerwiz_222> no, i never put it in the fridge, but the humidity should be enough to shorten the life significantly
2011-05-30T20:15:22  <computerwiz_222> amstan: how do we get tallgrass then?
2011-05-30T20:15:30  <amstan> we can't apparently
2011-05-30T20:15:31  <computerwiz_222> amstan: huge train out to narnia where tall grass grows?
2011-05-30T20:15:43  <Frontier> computerwiz_222: I'd just open it and clean the fan, but it has been away for a repair only a few months ago.
2011-05-30T20:16:02  <amstan> Frontier: put it in a big metal box, then put it in the fridge
2011-05-30T20:16:07  <computerwiz_222> Frontier: those cans of compressed air will do the job, no need to take it apart
2011-05-30T20:16:16  <amstan> just remember to accomodate for the temperature difference
2011-05-30T20:16:21  <computerwiz_222> amstan: put descicant in that box
2011-05-30T20:16:21  <amstan> what you don't want is condensation
2011-05-30T20:16:23  <amstan> do it slow
2011-05-30T20:16:34  <amstan> you still have the problem when you open the box and it's cold
2011-05-30T20:17:45  <computerwiz_222> amstan: will a huge train work?
2011-05-30T20:17:51  <amstan> ?
2011-05-30T20:18:01  <computerwiz_222> to where the chunks with long grass are
2011-05-30T20:19:01  <amstan> yeah, but that's weird
2011-05-30T20:19:17  <Frontier> does this game have a limit at all?
2011-05-30T20:19:38  <amstan> Frontier: why should it?
2011-05-30T20:19:42  <computerwiz_222> ants? or minecraft?
2011-05-30T20:20:33  <Frontier> minecraft. i really stare in unbelief of this code. how... can anything on a computer be so frontierless?
2011-05-30T20:20:47  <amstan> code? what code?
2011-05-30T20:21:06  <Frontier> the minecraft code. it only seems to know about 'bed rock'
2011-05-30T20:21:21  <amstan> where did you get the code from?
2011-05-30T20:21:35  <Frontier> reverse engeneering of the server jar
2011-05-30T20:21:38  <computerwiz_222> Frontier: you stare at that code in disbelief? how is that possible? lol every time notch fixes anything he breaks so much more in the process
2011-05-30T20:21:56  <amstan> oh yes, i'm so tired of those
2011-05-30T20:22:09  <amstan> computerwiz_222: the more i read that version list the more i think we should git revert our map from today
2011-05-30T20:22:21  <computerwiz_222> also, the game has bounds, go really (i mean really...) far away
2011-05-30T20:22:33  <computerwiz_222> there are some rounding issues that cause map generation to pretty much die
2011-05-30T20:22:48  <Frontier> no i didn't reverse engineer it, but i know that it can handle huge worlds. maps without practical limits. this is new to me
2011-05-30T20:23:16  <computerwiz_222> amstan: i'm not too concerned... what is your gripe with it?
2011-05-30T20:23:32  <amstan> computerwiz_222: items dissapearing from your hands is one of them
2011-05-30T20:23:39  <computerwiz_222> well... i think i can wait
2011-05-30T20:23:43  <computerwiz_222> i don't plan to play today
2011-05-30T20:23:46  <computerwiz_222> or tomorrow..
2011-05-30T20:24:31  <computerwiz_222> i just finished all the prelabs (except for digital)
2011-05-30T20:25:02  <amstan> computerwiz_222: this one will kill you: "All TNT-entities stay client-side after exploding, until reconnection. (New bug because before just random ones stayed)"
2011-05-30T20:25:22  <computerwiz_222> amstan: fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu
2011-05-30T20:26:42  <Frontier> have you seen the video of the realtime digital clock in minecraft?
2011-05-30T20:26:56  <amstan> wasn't real time
2011-05-30T20:27:05  <amstan> since he couldn't make the torches go fast enough
2011-05-30T20:27:11  <Frontier> there were even bugs in the relais, creepers spiders...
2011-05-30T20:27:28  <Frontier> oh, it looked very fast. ok never mind.
2011-05-30T20:28:19  <Frontier> the flying pig rider was great, too
2011-05-30T20:29:23  <amstan> Frontier: do you have a copy?
2011-05-30T20:29:57  <Frontier> no, I don't play minecraft
2011-05-30T20:30:03  <amstan> ok
2011-05-30T20:30:31  <Frontier> The really amazing things take a lot of time to build as well.

2011-05-30T21:14:53  <hjax> i just visited the lolcode website, im laughing so hard

2011-05-30T22:12:05  <amstan> McLeopold: not if we can help it
2011-05-30T22:19:35  <Frontier> I also find most compilers capable of the 'JavaCopiler' in compiler.py. That hack to have recursion into java packages works with a lot more languages.

2011-05-30T23:00:46  <Frontier> very nice, I hope its features were kept
2011-05-30T23:01:20  <janzert> yes, the only reason it was there was that I didn't want to make everything recursive in the middle of planetwars
2011-05-30T23:02:47  <janzert> so the person that made the change I forced them to put in into its own class at the time :}

2011-05-30T23:37:11  <amstan> from the worker host
2011-05-30T23:37:21  <amstan> since the worker keys are assigned per ip

2011-05-30T23:45:40  <amstan> soon

2011-05-30T23:47:18  <amstan> McLeopold: how will they provide fixes or even report on bugs if they don't have accounts?
2011-05-30T23:47:27  <McLeopold> github
2011-05-30T23:50:10  <xQuasar> McLeopold: Yeah but I'm wondering when it officially starts :p ie. up on the main website with live rankings, etc
2011-05-30T23:50:30  <McLeopold> soon, but we could use beta testers
2011-05-30T23:50:36  <xQuasar> mmk
2011-05-30T23:50:47  <xQuasar> Is the java port ready yet?
2011-05-30T23:50:53  <xQuasar> I know c++ but I like java more (don't judge)
2011-05-30T23:51:06  <olexs> there is a working java starter package, yes
2011-05-30T23:51:08  <McLeopold> a java starter bot was written, yes
2011-05-30T23:51:35  <olexs> I used it first but switched to c++ in the process... don't see a way to get enough power out of java for this game

2011-05-30T23:54:46  <olexs> yes
2011-05-30T23:54:50  <amstan> 1 second
2011-05-30T23:54:54  <Frontier> 500ms
2011-05-30T23:54:55  <McLeopold> It's set at 500ms on beta
2011-05-30T23:54:59  <amstan> oh
2011-05-30T23:55:01  <amstan> ok
2011-05-30T23:55:18  <McLeopold> but, I'm not using serial, so it's pretty tight
2011-05-30T23:55:19  <olexs> bot is told what it is on game init, right?
2011-05-30T23:55:20  <Frontier> my bot need moar, like 10 seconds
2011-05-30T23:55:37  <McLeopold> olexs: yes, and you have a separate startup time, which is 3000ms
2011-05-30T23:55:54  <McLeopold> Frontier: your bot has paulsy
2011-05-30T23:56:00  <olexs> mcleopold: ok, nice.
2011-05-30T23:56:27  <xQuasar> 300ms startup time's gonna be a bitch for java hm.
2011-05-30T23:56:36  <amstan> 3000?
2011-05-30T23:56:42  <xQuasar> oh
2011-05-30T23:56:43  <amstan> 3 seconds is not enough for java
2011-05-30T23:56:55  <xQuasar> You guys should increase it for me then :)
2011-05-30T23:56:59  <olexs> 3000. it's enough to preallocate a lot of stuff, but my bot still timed out later in the game
2011-05-30T23:57:09  <McLeopold> olexs: you get sent "loadtime 3000" and "turntime 500" right now
2011-05-30T23:57:12  <Frontier> ...LATER in the game
2011-05-30T23:57:55  <olexs> iterating over all ants and such :) the c++ version I have now seems to work fine though
2011-05-30T23:58:15  <Frontier> hmm.. can one query linux when the process was spawned from inside the bot? could be helpful in debugging
2011-05-30T23:58:44  <McLeopold> olexs: what's your bot name?
2011-05-30T23:58:54  <olexs> mcleopold: leviathan
2011-05-30T23:59:32  <McLeopold> let's try serial and see if that helps Frontier
