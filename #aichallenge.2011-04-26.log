2011-04-26T00:00:05  <janzert> there was a closed beta period before opening to the public
2011-04-26T00:00:13  <McLeopold> amstan: I thought about that, but it is only a test database and so I didn't care
2011-04-26T00:00:13  <amstan> _flag: umm... yes..
2011-04-26T00:00:30  <antimatroid> didn't notice that, i saw the first post on reddit like a week before official openiong
2011-04-26T00:00:32  <amstan> _flag: can you make another one? and this time fork the repo
2011-04-26T00:00:41  <McLeopold> amstan: plus, it's a funny password
2011-04-26T00:01:21  <_flag> amstan: another what exactly?
2011-04-26T00:01:32  <amstan> _flag: another c starter
2011-04-26T00:01:40  <amstan> _flag: if you want me to delete this one..
2011-04-26T00:02:14  <_flag> What I meant is you can just ignore the example bot, the starter pack is fine
2011-04-26T00:03:02  <_flag> I'm talking about this: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/issues/41
2011-04-26T00:04:52  <_flag> amstan: ping
2011-04-26T00:05:14  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-04-26T00:05:23  <amstan> _flag: so i don't have to do anything then?
2011-04-26T00:05:29  <amstan> _flag: i'm confused
2011-04-26T00:05:51  <amstan> _flag: keep in mind that we're using an older version of your repo atm, i wasn't aware you made new changes or if i'm supposed to use them
2011-04-26T00:06:17  <antimatroid> _flag: oh, there's a new line of input btw :P
2011-04-26T00:06:29  <antimatroid> there is now an 'r' line
2011-04-26T00:06:41  <antimatroid> the old bots aren't broken, but it'd be cool if the starter bot got updated
2011-04-26T00:06:48  <_flag> amstan: Originally I had a sample bot instead of the starter bot because I wasn't aware the starter bot had a spec
2011-04-26T00:07:07  <antimatroid> basically you just stop clearing food information each turn and if you get an 'r' line, remove food information at the specified location
2011-04-26T00:07:08  <_flag> antimatroid: Is it on the wiki? I can do it tommorow
2011-04-26T00:07:12  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-26T00:07:16  <antimatroid> no rush :)
2011-04-26T00:07:35  <antimatroid> it makes it easy to track information about food out of sight and know the correct value of a visible square
2011-04-26T00:07:57  <antimatroid> if one doesn't change the bot it just keeps working as it did

2011-04-26T00:23:16  <McLeopold> amstan: it takes awhile, it's lots of test data
2011-04-26T00:24:44  <amstan> McLeopold: it's still doing it..
2011-04-26T00:24:57  <CIA-33> aichallenge: janzert epsilon * r7675414 / (setup/worker_setup.py worker/jail_own.c): Add small program to change ownership of certain jail files between the jail user and contest user - http://bit.ly/esljh5
2011-04-26T00:25:18  <amstan> and there's still no rankings on the site
2011-04-26T00:25:47  <amstan> McLeopold: i'm running it with def create_test_data(user_count=5000, map_count=100, game_count=1000000, matchup_count=10):
2011-04-26T00:25:48  <janzert> if there are any C Unix programmers around, a thorough review of jail_own.c above would be really good
2011-04-26T00:25:49  <amstan> is that bad?
2011-04-26T00:26:02  <janzert> since it is the only setuid program of the contest
2011-04-26T00:26:25  <amstan> janzert: you could try #c if nobody comes up
2011-04-26T00:26:32  <amstan> i found the ppl there to know their stuff
2011-04-26T00:27:12  <janzert> yeah, if no one looks at it before then as we get closer that would be a good idea
2011-04-26T00:27:32  <janzert> I'll hold off for now in case I need further changes in functionality first
2011-04-26T00:28:33  <janzert> at least all the pieces should now be in place for sandbox.py to do real sandboxing on a worker
2011-04-26T00:28:47  <janzert> now to just make it actually do it
2011-04-26T00:32:03  <amstan> janzert: owner_uid = CONTEST_UID
2011-04-26T00:32:15  <amstan> janzert: is that supposed to be defined in a header file?
2011-04-26T00:33:16  <janzert> no, it's defined with "gcc -DCONTEST_UID=blah -DCONTEST_GID=blag -DJAIL_GID=blar jail_own.c -o jail_own" currently
2011-04-26T00:34:00  <amstan> oh, ok
2011-04-26T00:34:03  <janzert> I thought about a real makefile for it but the python seemed easier :}
2011-04-26T00:34:11  <amstan> McLeopold: i got bored, changed it to much lower values
2011-04-26T00:34:29  <amstan> McLeopold: it finished but i still don't see much
2011-04-26T00:34:38  <McLeopold> amstan: you only need that for load testing database queries
2011-04-26T00:34:51  <McLeopold> use small amounts just for looking at web pages
2011-04-26T00:35:06  <amstan> no.. what i wanted was a way to see a rankings table
2011-04-26T00:35:18  <amstan> or is that not finished yet?
2011-04-26T00:35:25  <McLeopold> a few users is good enough for that, isn't it?
2011-04-26T00:35:38  <amstan> by table i meant html table
2011-04-26T00:35:41  <McLeopold> no, not finished yet

2011-04-26T01:54:26  <sigh> amstan_, that site does not work so well for me in firefox, when I press a key it types but then it launches the quickfind box so any more typing is captured by that
2011-04-26T01:54:53  <amstan_> quickfind box?
2011-04-26T01:55:30  <janzert> sigh: wierd, it works fine here on FF 4
2011-04-26T01:55:50  <sigh> pressing / in a normal page on firefox puts you in the quick find box
2011-04-26T01:55:51  <janzert> amstan_: I assume what you would get by hitting /
2011-04-26T01:55:57  <sigh> on that page it does it with any key
2011-04-26T01:56:11  <amstan_> worked for me in firefox
2011-04-26T01:56:13  <amstan_> weird

2011-04-26T01:59:55  <sigh> ahh...if I hold down ctrl or alt I can press the alphanum keys

2011-04-26T02:04:22  <McLeopold> sigh: In a nut shell, 1 point per ant spawn in addition to the kill points
2011-04-26T02:04:24  <antimatroid> the idea is to give every ant spawned a point
2011-04-26T02:05:39  <McLeopold> *crickets*
2011-04-26T02:05:39  <antimatroid> the basic reasoning being that an ant that improves their food collection should see a noticeable boost in their rankings (get 'em hooked)
2011-04-26T02:05:54  <antimatroid> we've had a fairly lengthy discussion about what it does/n't encourage
2011-04-26T02:06:11  <sigh> that seem quite easy
2011-04-26T02:06:18  <sigh> makes the scoring a bit more consistent
2011-04-26T02:06:34  <McLeopold> yeah, now there are 2 things you can do to score
2011-04-26T02:06:41  <McLeopold> make ants and kill ants
2011-04-26T02:06:48  <McLeopold> the best of both worlds
2011-04-26T02:06:58  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: I belive you had a similar idea to me of having a last seen  array, correct? :)
2011-04-26T02:07:03  <antimatroid> and you can think of it like this, each and is worth 1 point + whatever it makes from damaging dying enemies
2011-04-26T02:07:09  <McLeopold> plus, we think there is still enough discouragement of campers and drawn out games
2011-04-26T02:07:29  <antimatroid> the question is, does the first ant get a point?
2011-04-26T02:07:32  <antimatroid> the poor little bugger
2011-04-26T02:07:35  <jaycobcoleman> also, I love this. creating ants should definitely score points
2011-04-26T02:07:40  <sigh> antimatroid, might as well

2011-04-26T02:07:55  <jaycobcoleman> free point
2011-04-26T02:08:08  <McLeopold> how about -100 if he dies
2011-04-26T02:08:25  <janzert> sigh: just going over the seq branch, it looks fine to merge to epsilon at least so we can play with it more and check that sequential running works for us
2011-04-26T02:08:40  <jaycobcoleman> The first ant?
2011-04-26T02:08:40  <jaycobcoleman> or the bot?
2011-04-26T02:08:53  <janzert> probably better to get it back into the mainline soon so it doesn't bitrot anymore than it has
2011-04-26T02:08:56  <sigh> janzert, cool, thanks
2011-04-26T02:09:08  <McLeopold> the first ant
2011-04-26T02:09:26  <jaycobcoleman> meehhhhh that seems like a bad plan
2011-04-26T02:09:27  <janzert> btw, I'll be working heavily in sandbox.py starting tomorrow
2011-04-26T02:09:53  <McLeopold> oh, it's a *really* bad plan, but would be funny
2011-04-26T02:10:09  <jaycobcoleman> haha yes indeed
2011-04-26T02:10:12  <sigh> oh ok, I'll the merge soon

2011-04-26T02:10:44  * janzert *still* likes inverse elimination :P
2011-04-26T02:10:56  * McLeopold wonders what janzert means
2011-04-26T02:11:02  * janzert goes afk before anyone can start arguing with him over that
2011-04-26T02:11:07  <janzert> for game scoring
2011-04-26T02:11:15  * McLeopold still wonders
2011-04-26T02:11:35  <McLeopold> was that in the wiki?
2011-04-26T02:11:38  <antimatroid> i think inverse elimination with strongly discourage attacking
2011-04-26T02:11:52  <janzert> first person eliminated is ranked last, last person surviving is ranked first
2011-04-26T02:11:54  <antimatroid> which will lead to long drawn out games
2011-04-26T02:11:55  <janzert> and I'm gone
2011-04-26T02:12:20  <McLeopold> play galcon online, then come argue that
2011-04-26T02:12:58  <McLeopold> :P
2011-04-26T02:13:04  * McLeopold forgot another smiley
2011-04-26T02:13:30  * antimatroid was recently alerted to the feature where you can strip the smileys and get the original text
2011-04-26T02:13:33  <sigh> I think the food bonus will be large enough so that last player remaining will win anyway
2011-04-26T02:13:34  <McLeopold> you guys must think I'm a totaly asshole half the time if you though -100 was serious?
2011-04-26T02:13:38  <antimatroid> it's very nice when maths etc. is given
2011-04-26T02:13:58  <antimatroid> McLeopold: who took that seriously?
2011-04-26T02:14:00  <McLeopold> in pidgen?
2011-04-26T02:14:02  <antimatroid> serially*
2011-04-26T02:14:07  <sigh> I did, I was about to push the change :(
2011-04-26T02:14:08  <antimatroid> yeah, pidgin <3
2011-04-26T02:14:19  <jaycobcoleman> me :)
2011-04-26T02:14:21  <antimatroid> "disable smileys in selected text"
2011-04-26T02:14:23  <McLeopold> I took me 2 month to find the smiley off switch :)
2011-04-26T02:14:34  <antimatroid> i was told about it like last week
2011-04-26T02:14:42  <McLeopold> wait, change your theme
2011-04-26T02:14:51  <jaycobcoleman> I had no smileys to begin with
2011-04-26T02:14:52  <McLeopold> perminant off
2011-04-26T02:15:00  <antimatroid> oh, i like having them d;
2011-04-26T02:15:15  <sigh> (>^_^)>
2011-04-26T02:15:25  <antimatroid> apparenly backwards smileys makes someone a girl
2011-04-26T02:15:37  <antimatroid> so i've been sticking it to the stereotype of late

2011-04-26T02:21:47  <McLeopold> lol
2011-04-26T02:22:12  <McLeopold> (cause we use the Fraction class, hee hee)
2011-04-26T02:22:38  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: the scoring method for battles makes perfect sense for the damage option
2011-04-26T02:23:46  <jaycobcoleman> 1/(number of ants in battle) distributed to every ant in the battle?
2011-04-26T02:23:56  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-04-26T02:24:06  <antimatroid> okay, maybe not perfectly
2011-04-26T02:24:08  <antimatroid> but close
2011-04-26T02:24:10  <McLeopold> ants adding damage to a death at to be specific

2011-04-26T02:24:39  <antimatroid> yeah, even colliding ants get points
2011-04-26T02:24:43  <antimatroid> and colliding ants give out points
2011-04-26T02:24:46  <McLeopold> do they?
2011-04-26T02:24:49  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-26T02:24:56  <McLeopold> if an enemy is in range
2011-04-26T02:24:57  <antimatroid> otherwise if two enemies collided no one got points
2011-04-26T02:24:59  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-26T02:25:23  <antimatroid> sigh: is that right? collided ants get points from dying battle ants and vice versa?
2011-04-26T02:25:34  <sigh> yeah
2011-04-26T02:25:41  <antimatroid> i like it like that
2011-04-26T02:26:13  <antimatroid> and you can't collide your ants in battle range of an enemy to stop them getting points
2011-04-26T02:26:17  <antimatroid> although you can outside range
2011-04-26T02:26:25  <antimatroid> say you have 2 ants surrounded

2011-04-26T02:30:17  <antimatroid> it's right at the bottom

2011-04-26T02:31:03  <McLeopold> it's probably perfect

2011-04-26T02:32:33  <jaycobcoleman> alright, I figured you'd have it covered :P
2011-04-26T02:34:52  <antimatroid> i'm still not sure about that blue
2011-04-26T02:35:02  <antimatroid> i wonder if a dirt coloured brown would look nicer
2011-04-26T02:35:26  <McLeopold> yes, brown would look nicer
2011-04-26T02:36:03  <jaycobcoleman> animatroid: I was talking to amstan about that earier :P
2011-04-26T02:36:26  <jaycobcoleman> would making a dirt image from scratch be the best option?
2011-04-26T02:37:28  <McLeopold> use repeating layered backgrounds
2011-04-26T02:38:31  <antimatroid> i like whoever had the idea of making the background reflect different maps
2011-04-26T02:39:28  <jaycobcoleman> oh yes I remember that
2011-04-26T02:40:03  <jaycobcoleman> But to like a person for a single idea seems pretty shallow :P
2011-04-26T02:41:07  <antimatroid> i realised that mishap
2011-04-26T02:41:10  <antimatroid> i meant i liked the idea
2011-04-26T02:41:16  <antimatroid> but i like the person anyway, shallow or not

2011-04-26T04:20:23  <jaycobcoleman> I think a problem he brought up with the previous python code would also apply to your c++ vision code

2011-04-26T04:20:47  <jaycobcoleman> *previous python vision code that is
2011-04-26T04:21:49  <McLeopold> there's got to be a way to pick the correct ant when you merge
2011-04-26T04:22:16  <antimatroid> i don't think so

2011-04-26T04:22:28  <antimatroid> line 71 on has the vision code
2011-04-26T04:22:35  <antimatroid> it uses a new visited vector for each ant
2011-04-26T04:23:46  <jaycobcoleman> that it does :)
2011-04-26T04:24:02  <jaycobcoleman> although that does seem terribly inefficient...

2011-04-26T04:28:02  <antimatroid> vision isn't terribly expensive anyway
2011-04-26T04:28:06  <antimatroid> you only need to run it once per turn
2011-04-26T04:29:09  <antimatroid> a harder problem is finding the set of ants that might affect one of your ants with a battle
2011-04-26T04:29:14  <jaycobcoleman> maybe I'm just getting too used to python where everything is expensive :P
2011-04-26T04:29:23  <antimatroid> a%%b, a%.b, a.%b begins to highlight my problem
2011-04-26T04:29:58  <antimatroid> and of course one would like it to be general for different battle radiuses

2011-04-26T04:30:23  <antimatroid> whether it's possible for the ants to land in a battle
2011-04-26T04:30:35  <antimatroid> and hence whether they should be considered in the same "game"
2011-04-26T04:30:47  <jaycobcoleman> I see

2011-04-26T04:33:50  <antimatroid> i think the best might be to find the subset of 5 squares you might be able to land in
2011-04-26T04:34:04  <antimatroid> then search the extended set to see if any ants can move into a square within range of one of those
2011-04-26T04:34:41  <antimatroid> another thing would be a.a..b
2011-04-26T04:34:45  <antimatroid> you don't need to consider the first a there

2011-04-26T04:35:53  <jaycobcoleman> could you just test the outermost squares of your current battle radius and see if any enemies are within 2 squares of each of them?
2011-04-26T04:36:04  <jaycobcoleman> or within of course
2011-04-26T04:36:24  <antimatroid> but what about a%.b
2011-04-26T04:36:29  <antimatroid> i mean a%%b
2011-04-26T04:36:40  <antimatroid> you don't want to put those two in the same game
2011-04-26T04:37:14  <antimatroid> putting more players than necessary in a game is about the most costly thing you can do
2011-04-26T04:37:31  <antimatroid> and not good strategy
2011-04-26T04:39:53  <jaycobcoleman> okay well for each ant create an array of the distances to each square and if any enemy ants are within your battle radius plus 2 and the distance they need to travel to get to you is consistent with that value then they're a part of the game
2011-04-26T04:40:27  <antimatroid> "for each ant create an array of the distances to each square"
2011-04-26T04:40:28  <antimatroid> lol what
2011-04-26T04:40:32  <antimatroid> that would be very expensive
2011-04-26T04:40:43  <jaycobcoleman> you aren't storing it
2011-04-26T04:40:56  <jaycobcoleman> it isn't so terrible
2011-04-26T04:41:08  <jaycobcoleman> and it's not for the whole map
2011-04-26T04:41:09  <antimatroid> it is when i want it to be quite fast
2011-04-26T04:41:16  <jaycobcoleman> you really only need to do it for your battle radius plus 2
2011-04-26T04:41:22  <jaycobcoleman> which would be quite fast
2011-04-26T04:46:00  <jaycobcoleman> another option would be to check each square on a direct path from you to an enemy ant to see if it is water. if so +2 to the total distance to compenstate, then check all around for more water, adding to compensate each time, until you run out of water in one direction or reach BR+2
2011-04-26T04:46:30  <jaycobcoleman> although that's not entirely accurate...

2011-04-26T05:18:14  <jaycobcoleman> that could be fixed by adding diagonal movement. and the fact that you'd actually be moving much faster going diagonally could be accounted for by making twice as high and wide and making movement in a single direction worth two squares whereas diagonal movement would be 1x1

2011-04-26T08:31:27  <antimatroid> or more importantly, how can i do that better?
2011-04-26T08:32:39  <sigh> what do you mean like python? you mean how python takes the sign from the Divisor?
2011-04-26T08:32:53  <antimatroid> i want -6%5 = 4
2011-04-26T08:33:26  <antimatroid> i'm worried about translating with the vision code, and it not wrapping properly with my +rows)%rows trick
2011-04-26T08:33:39  <sigh> what about 6%-5?
2011-04-26T08:33:55  <antimatroid> i wouldn't be calling it with -5 :P
2011-04-26T08:34:07  <sigh> :P
2011-04-26T08:34:12  <antimatroid> or, do you think it's safe for my to assume rows/cols > viewradius?
2011-04-26T08:34:44  <mcstar> perl unload beep
2011-04-26T08:35:30  <sigh> antimatroid: using floating point operations for integer arithmatic is rarely safe
2011-04-26T08:35:50  <antimatroid> so how do i get python like modulo in c++? :P
2011-04-26T08:35:58  <antimatroid> otherwise my code is not general
2011-04-26T08:36:20  <sigh> just do: r=t%n; if (r<0) r+=n;

2011-04-26T08:59:25  <sigh> mcstar: what do you mean?
2011-04-26T08:59:32  <mcstar> why isnt it -1?
2011-04-26T09:00:06  <sigh> well, antimatroid means (-6)%5
2011-04-26T09:00:11  <mcstar> -1*5-1=-6
2011-04-26T09:00:36  <mcstar> the remainder is -1
2011-04-26T09:00:51  <sigh> yes, but also -2*5+5=-6 :)
2011-04-26T09:01:00  <sigh> -2*5+4=-6 :)
2011-04-26T09:01:20  <mcstar> aha
2011-04-26T09:01:49  <mcstar> i still dont see why is 4 preferred over -1
2011-04-26T09:01:59  <sigh> both -1 and 4 are valid answers... some languages take the sign from the dividend and some from the divisor
2011-04-26T09:02:13  <mcstar> i get it
2011-04-26T09:02:35  <sigh> new_row = (current_row-1)%height
2011-04-26T09:02:45  <delt0r___> It should be 4 not -1 if we treat % as mod
2011-04-26T09:02:56  <sigh> nice to guarantee that the result is positive
2011-04-26T09:03:22  <sigh> delt0r___: what do you mean?
2011-04-26T09:03:27  <mcstar> i see, its a convention to make life easier
2011-04-26T09:03:48  <delt0r___> negative is just "counting" backwards... ie moving the other direction on the number line, and with mod you number line goes from 0 to 5 (mod 6)
2011-04-26T09:04:01  <delt0r___> with wraping---there are no "negatives"
2011-04-26T09:04:08  <delt0r___> other than a+-a=0
2011-04-26T09:04:09  <sigh> mcstar: yes... also in antimatroid's case, he wants to port python code, and python takes the sign form the divisior
2011-04-26T09:04:31  <delt0r___> the the negative of 3 mod 6 is 3
2011-04-26T09:04:35  <delt0r___> not -3

2011-04-26T09:05:11  <delt0r___> well it should be a prime... they are cooler..
2011-04-26T09:05:12  <mcstar> totally different case :)

2011-04-26T09:05:40  <sigh> 5 is already a prime!
2011-04-26T09:06:07  <delt0r___> in fact -1 here mean "the negative of 1" rather than "minus 1"
2011-04-26T09:06:19  <delt0r___> the negative with respect to +

2011-04-26T09:07:11  <delt0r___> sigh: there is not really one. it just that minus one in not in the set of valid numbers
2011-04-26T09:08:02  <delt0r___> in finite fields or rings or groups --all operations results in members of the set
2011-04-26T09:08:14  <delt0r___> ie the operation is closed
2011-04-26T09:08:21  <delt0r___> its all moot really however
2011-04-26T09:08:31  <sigh> sure, I agree :)
2011-04-26T09:08:35  <delt0r___> since % should not genreally be read as mod
2011-04-26T09:08:41  <delt0r___> but remainder
2011-04-26T09:08:46  <delt0r___> which is different
2011-04-26T09:08:49  <sigh> :)
2011-04-26T09:09:18  <sigh> I do agree that taking the sign from the dividend is silly... I wonder why some languages/implementations do that
2011-04-26T09:09:38  <delt0r___> its a classic way of defining remainder
2011-04-26T09:10:12  <sigh> i see
2011-04-26T09:10:19  <mcstar> if u take N for example % never takes u out of the set
2011-04-26T09:10:44  <mcstar> but if u take Z than an ambiguity arises
2011-04-26T09:10:56  <delt0r___> yes
2011-04-26T09:11:09  <delt0r___> p*q+r=x
2011-04-26T09:11:27  <delt0r___> where p, q, r and x are in Z
2011-04-26T09:12:07  <mcstar> btw u can say (((int)(p/q)+1)*q)%q
2011-04-26T09:12:25  <mcstar> and it gives the crrect answer w/o checking sign
2011-04-26T09:12:35  <mcstar> correct as in pythonic
2011-04-26T09:13:06  <mcstar> btw u can say (p+((int)(p/q)+1)*q)%q
2011-04-26T09:13:09  <mcstar> hehe
2011-04-26T09:13:11  <mcstar> typo
2011-04-26T09:13:48  <mcstar> soo much shorter than checkin if (r<0) ....
2011-04-26T09:14:02  <delt0r___> dam
2011-04-26T09:14:08  <sigh> rather stay away from using floating point in integer arithmetic unless there is a clear advantage and the code is fool-proof

2011-04-26T09:22:05  <mcstar> can ?: be paranthesized?
2011-04-26T09:22:09  <mcstar> i guess
2011-04-26T09:22:23  <mcstar> but wikipedia says its different from if/else

2011-04-26T09:37:31  <mcstar> back to lisp
2011-04-26T09:37:48  <mcstar> i will try and write my bot in lisp
2011-04-26T09:38:04  <mcstar> i guess this will be hard
2011-04-26T09:38:17  <mcstar> since i got acquinted with it only recently
2011-04-26T09:38:29  <sigh> i would probably have tried that if I was writing a bot, that or haskell
2011-04-26T09:38:49  <mcstar> i know even less about haskell :(
2011-04-26T09:38:53  <mcstar> but its very nice
2011-04-26T09:38:59  <mcstar> very concise
2011-04-26T09:39:03  <sigh> i looked at jmcarthur's haskell starter and it scared me
2011-04-26T09:39:24  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-26T09:39:41  <mcstar> the problem with haskell is IO
2011-04-26T09:39:54  <mcstar> its through monads
2011-04-26T09:39:56  <mcstar> or whatever
2011-04-26T09:40:06  <sigh> IO is not too bad
2011-04-26T09:40:22  <sigh> just monads in general are hard to get your head around
2011-04-26T09:40:39  <mcstar> but since i dont know the language i cant know monads so i cant write IO until i know some more
2011-04-26T09:40:51  <mcstar> for example in C io is very easy
2011-04-26T09:41:04  <mcstar> u dont really have to know the language itself
2011-04-26T09:41:24  <sigh> I think when starting out you can just take the boiler plate for doing IO as magic and go with that
2011-04-26T09:41:44  <sigh> and that works well enough until you learn monads properly
2011-04-26T09:41:57  <mcstar> ur right, but time matters in my case and lisp boilerplate is easier
2011-04-26T09:42:03  <sigh> :)
2011-04-26T09:42:42  <sigh> have you used any functional languages before?
2011-04-26T09:42:50  <mcstar> Mathematica?
2011-04-26T09:42:58  <mcstar> not purely functional
2011-04-26T09:43:02  <mcstar> but close
2011-04-26T09:43:30  <mcstar> and there are constructs in python
2011-04-26T09:43:37  <mcstar> that mimic functional style
2011-04-26T09:43:44  <mcstar> thats it
2011-04-26T09:43:45  <sigh> yeah, fair enough
2011-04-26T09:44:06  <sigh> python's functional capabilities are pretty lame
2011-04-26T09:44:14  <sigh> especially given it's crappy lambdas
2011-04-26T09:44:18  <sigh> *its
2011-04-26T09:44:19  <delt0r___> mcstar: if you are half decent at math programming, and functional programing style won't be that hard for you IMO
2011-04-26T09:44:20  <mcstar> oh
2011-04-26T09:44:24  <mcstar> u mean single expression?
2011-04-26T09:44:49  <sigh> yeah... anonymous functions in an expression
2011-04-26T09:45:13  <mcstar> i mean in lambdas the body must consist of a single expression
2011-04-26T09:45:34  <sigh> yeah
2011-04-26T09:45:54  <sigh> makes it much much harder to take advantage of the higher level functions like map
2011-04-26T09:46:17  <mcstar> deltor: im not concerned about functional programming, but haskell is pretty different from anything i saw
2011-04-26T09:46:31  <delt0r___> I have gone off it completely
2011-04-26T09:46:32  <mcstar> lazy evaluation, type system....

2011-04-26T09:48:50  <delt0r___> well YMMV
2011-04-26T09:48:58  <delt0r___> back a bit now
2011-04-26T09:49:00  <delt0r___> why?
2011-04-26T09:49:13  <mcstar> i want to write a console file manager
2011-04-26T09:49:13  <delt0r___> its not something you really need for this
2011-04-26T09:49:24  <mcstar> not for this no
2011-04-26T09:50:04  <delt0r___> from memory it was fine... quite simple providing the terminal supported everything properly
2011-04-26T09:50:06  <sigh> delt0r___: actually I tried to start an ascii visualiser for this game but the map was too big to display nicely
2011-04-26T09:50:19  <sigh> so you ncurses could be used for this :P
2011-04-26T09:50:31  <delt0r___> in linux this is pretty much always the case.
2011-04-26T09:50:55  <delt0r___> but working with older VT whatever can be a problem i heard
2011-04-26T09:51:06  <smiley1983> I have a little experience with ncurses
2011-04-26T09:51:08  <smiley1983> Some time ago
2011-04-26T09:51:13  <mcstar> what language binding did u use?
2011-04-26T09:51:17  <smiley1983> Ocaml
2011-04-26T09:51:23  <smiley1983> And Python before that
2011-04-26T09:51:53  <sigh> python has it as part of the standard library
2011-04-26T09:51:56  <mcstar> im interested in python/clisp/haskell
2011-04-26T09:52:12  <mcstar> good to know
2011-04-26T09:52:24  <sigh> http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html
2011-04-26T09:52:31  <smiley1983> sigh: Did it always? I thought I had to install it from somewhere, but I could be wrong
2011-04-26T09:53:11  <sigh> smiley1983: if I am reading the docs right, ncurses support has been around since 1.6
2011-04-26T09:53:52  <smiley1983> Right. It would have been there when I was using it, then.
2011-04-26T09:54:23  <mcstar> thats not python 1.6
2011-04-26T09:54:29  <mcstar> sigh
2011-04-26T09:54:44  <sigh> really?
2011-04-26T09:54:45  <mcstar> down a bit it talks about version 5.4
2011-04-26T09:55:11  <mcstar> and i think python only has v 3.1?
2011-04-26T09:55:14  <mcstar> or something
2011-04-26T09:55:14  <sigh> 5.4 is refering to the ncurses library
2011-04-26T09:55:23  <mcstar> and 1.6 too i think
2011-04-26T09:55:43  <sigh> but throughout the python docs, it references when features were introduced and it gives the version in italics
2011-04-26T09:57:08  <smiley1983> I seem to recall the Python binding does some work to make it a bit friendlier for the programmer.
2011-04-26T09:57:18  <mcstar> ok ur right
2011-04-26T09:57:37  <smiley1983> Not that it's particularly unfriendly.
2011-04-26T09:58:32  <mcstar> i think through this file manager project i will learn haskell
2011-04-26T09:58:46  <mcstar> it has up-to-date bindings as i saw

2011-04-26T09:59:23  <mcstar> if they write window manager in it a file manager can be done too

2011-04-26T10:03:21  <mcstar> im curious about your opinion
2011-04-26T10:03:30  <mcstar> regarding a console file manager
2011-04-26T10:03:51  <mcstar> the main idea is that i would implement tabs as standalone windows
2011-04-26T10:04:22  <mcstar> so u get different folder views, but not in tabs, like in most fmanagers

2011-04-26T10:04:41  <mcstar> but in different windows, which communicate with each other
2011-04-26T10:04:52  <sigh> how do they communicate?
2011-04-26T10:05:15  <mcstar> theres a server-like process, and it can spawn several guis
2011-04-26T10:05:23  <mcstar> and they are the clients
2011-04-26T10:05:36  <mcstar> and they would use miller-columns
2011-04-26T10:05:43  <sigh> ahh
2011-04-26T10:06:13  <mcstar> i think it would be ideal with tiling-wms
2011-04-26T10:07:38  <sigh> I just use screen for everything :P
2011-04-26T10:08:36  <mcstar> i always get frustrated when i have to use tabs
2011-04-26T10:08:42  <mcstar> or a two column file manager
2011-04-26T10:09:13  <mcstar> u mean like mc is running in screen?
2011-04-26T10:09:27  <sigh> mc?
2011-04-26T10:09:32  <mcstar> midnight commander
2011-04-26T10:09:42  <mcstar> what console file manager do u use?
2011-04-26T10:09:50  <mcstar> plain shell?
2011-04-26T10:10:12  <sigh> I don't use a console file manager
2011-04-26T10:10:22  <sigh> just that when I use the console, I do it in screen
2011-04-26T10:10:38  <sigh> so that renders a tiling window manager kind of moot
2011-04-26T10:10:38  <mcstar> ok

2011-04-26T11:18:53  <_0x47> Hey, after reading the rules I undesrstand that in this ( http://pastebin.com/BpAYBpHa ) game, the green bot would win, even if my bot (red) has like 3 quarters of all ants? is that fair tho?
2011-04-26T11:19:01  <_0x47> understand*
2011-04-26T11:19:49  <_0x47> if you don't have the visualizer right now, paste it here: http://www.fuceekay.com/ants_visualizer/copy_paste.html
2011-04-26T11:23:20  <Kingpin13> the documentation for the new challenge is very confusing to an "outsider," would now be a good or bad time to start developing a bot?
2011-04-26T11:24:22  <_0x47> what is confusing?
2011-04-26T11:25:11  <Kingpin13> everything? For example, some stuff is just a direct copy and paste from the old contest, and doesn't make any sense in the new context
2011-04-26T11:25:28  <amstan> Kingpin13: what are you talking about?
2011-04-26T11:25:52  <Kingpin13> the uh, github wiki?
2011-04-26T11:26:20  <amstan> Kingpin13: as long as you click on the ants pages, you should be fine
2011-04-26T11:26:25  <Kingpin13> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Five-Minute-Quickstart-Guide
2011-04-26T11:27:04  <amstan> that one is copied and pasted because it has nothing to do with the actual competition type, it applies to all of them
2011-04-26T11:27:24  <Kingpin13> ah, I'm just confused by all the links pointing to the old website, I guess
2011-04-26T11:27:39  <amstan> the old website will be the main website
2011-04-26T11:27:51  <amstan> ants hasn't started yet, you could make a bot for it
2011-04-26T11:27:56  <amstan> but.. some stuff might change
2011-04-26T11:28:19  <_0x47> indeed, and hopefully the rules for scoring (see above)
2011-04-26T11:28:34  <amstan> _0x47: yeah, that doesn't seem cool
2011-04-26T11:28:36  <Kingpin13> ah okay, heh, so I gather :P. Are you aware of any .NET/C# starter packs, or do I need to build by own?
2011-04-26T11:28:46  <Kingpin13> I found a few, but they seem half finished
2011-04-26T11:29:08  <_0x47> you might use the c++ package and port it to c#
2011-04-26T11:29:32  <amstan> Kingpin13: there's some, but they don't seem to be informed that we're not actually using visual studio to run their bot
2011-04-26T11:29:54  <amstan> Kingpin13: if you find a good one that runs well in mono, please link me
2011-04-26T11:29:58  <Kingpin13> are you using mono?
2011-04-26T11:30:01  <amstan> yes
2011-04-26T11:30:44  <Kingpin13> Ah I see :P. Well I'll keep on looking ;)
2011-04-26T11:31:05  <Kingpin13> I suppose I could give in a use python, that's what all the backend stuff is written in right?
2011-04-26T11:31:34  <amstan> sure
2011-04-26T11:31:37  <amstan> but python's slow
2011-04-26T11:31:46  <amstan> java could work for you
2011-04-26T11:31:50  <amstan> or c/c++
2011-04-26T11:32:48  <Kingpin13> All true :D. Do you have perl support too?

2011-04-26T11:33:53  <amstan> we have support for anything
2011-04-26T11:34:00  <amstan> as long as it runs on ubuntu
2011-04-26T11:34:22  <_0x471> imho most .NET stuff runs on mono out of the box
2011-04-26T11:34:34  <_0x471> so, you could still use it
2011-04-26T11:34:50  <amstan> well.. try it and see
2011-04-26T11:34:55  <Kingpin13> well, I think it needs to be .NET 2.0 really, but I'm not that knowledgeable about mono
2011-04-26T11:35:31  <_0x471> iirc it's up to .NET 4.0

2011-04-26T11:37:51  <Kingpin13> I've actually never used mono before myself, if I install that on a windows is it going to get into conflicts with .NET...? Might as well just try I suppose
2011-04-26T11:39:05  <_0x471> i don't think it will conflict, but i have no real knowledge on mono either

2011-04-26T11:41:00  <mcstar> i agree with kingpin
2011-04-26T11:41:08  <mcstar> the wiki is confusing
2011-04-26T11:41:21  <mcstar> theres a link in 5 min. guid

2011-04-26T11:41:36  <mcstar> to register on ai-challenge.com
2011-04-26T11:41:40  <mcstar> it doesnt work
2011-04-26T11:41:42  <mcstar> but
2011-04-26T11:41:53  <mcstar> i could register on hypertriangle
2011-04-26T11:42:12  <amstan> mcstar: none of them are actually open
2011-04-26T11:42:20  <amstan> mcstar: it's just for testing for us
2011-04-26T11:42:31  <mcstar> i registered nevertheless :)
2011-04-26T11:42:42  <mcstar> does it mean it will be deleted?
2011-04-26T11:42:47  <amstan> i'm just saying.. it might dissapear in some case
2011-04-26T11:42:51  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-26T11:43:03  <amstan> and yes.. it'll definatelly not be copied to the main server
2011-04-26T11:43:06  <mcstar> but at hypertriangle at least a nice game animation welcomes me
2011-04-26T11:43:16  <amstan> the most you can do with hypertriangle is upload something..
2011-04-26T11:43:54  <mcstar> is the opening animation the same as the visualizer?
2011-04-26T11:44:31  <amstan> animation?
2011-04-26T11:44:37  <jmcarthur> i'm embarrassed that i've allowed that haskell starter to escape in the form it's in
2011-04-26T11:44:44  <amstan> lol
2011-04-26T11:45:00  <jmcarthur> with my name on it
2011-04-26T11:47:05  <Kingpin13> Heh, I installed monodevelop, started it, but when I focused on it, and it immediately went to (Not Responding) ;).
2011-04-26T11:47:24  <Kingpin13> I wonder if I'll need to install mono separately, or if it comes with it.
2011-04-26T11:49:17  <Kingpin13> by the way, do you still have the no threading rule?
2011-04-26T11:49:24  <amstan> yes

2011-04-26T12:53:49  <Frontier1> mcstar: the opening animation is the actual visualizer, yes. I was wondering when someone comes to me and asks me to implement a movie recorder, but I got around that it seems :-)
2011-04-26T12:53:55  *** Frontier1 is now known as Frontier
2011-04-26T12:56:30  <Frontier> Maybe I should remove the bordered mode alltogether. It is slightly more performant and always centers the map, so it is still of limited use, but I don't think it looks as good as the borderless mode, especially when used on the front page.

2011-04-26T13:05:59  <mcstar> there white rom on both sides

2011-04-26T13:07:12  <Frontier> but then you miss the top and bottom of the map :(

2011-04-26T13:07:45  <mcstar> see what i mean?
2011-04-26T13:07:58  <mcstar> no hiding of the map
2011-04-26T13:08:40  <mcstar> everyone has 1280x1024 monitors at least, it will fit on the page :)

2011-04-26T13:15:46  <mcstar> a bit slow in firefox
2011-04-26T13:16:14  <mcstar> better in chromium
2011-04-26T13:16:30  <mcstar> how does this work?
2011-04-26T13:16:54  <mcstar> the javascript instructs the browser in html5?
2011-04-26T13:16:59  <Frontier> My latest change made it a bit slower in Firefox when you zoom in and use no fog or letters on ants, it is a lot faster in the worst case scenarios though
2011-04-26T13:17:27  <Frontier> yeah. you have a canvas element and basically call draw functions on it

2011-04-26T13:18:33  <mcstar> or u can use javascript functions, and u dont see <></>
2011-04-26T13:18:41  <mcstar> aha
2011-04-26T13:18:46  <Frontier> it is all written in javascript

2011-04-26T13:19:18  <Frontier> the javascript also places the <canvas> element in the web page, hehe. this works because of DOM
2011-04-26T13:19:58  <Frontier> DOM means you can pretty much remove and add elements or change their attributes at any time through javascript

2011-04-26T13:35:33  <mcstar> ok
2011-04-26T13:36:43  <MatmaRex> alright, killed it, forked, cloned, works.
2011-04-26T13:36:56  <MatmaRex> amstan: should i rename it now, commit, and send you another pull req?
2011-04-26T13:36:57  <amstan> MatmaRex: what about upstream?
2011-04-26T13:37:43  <MatmaRex> i just deleted my local repo, killed git fork, and forked again, then cloned it to my computer
2011-04-26T13:37:55  <MatmaRex> i'll worry about upstream later ;)
2011-04-26T13:37:59  <amstan> MatmaRex: yes, but you're just supressing the symptoms
2011-04-26T13:38:04  <amstan> you should have upstream working too
2011-04-26T13:38:31  <MatmaRex> maybe it will now
2011-04-26T13:38:48  <MatmaRex> my computer seems to be somewhat non-determinative

2011-04-26T15:51:41  <antimatroid> you would find the green ant in your game didn't "fight" as well as the other ant
2011-04-26T15:51:41  <_0x47> i see, but anyways, that should solve it
2011-04-26T15:52:04  <antimatroid> but really, someone that can expand well should also do well, so we've added the spawn points
2011-04-26T15:52:28  <antimatroid> it also means people can get a nice boost in their ranking from doing food collection, which is the first obvious thing to tackle and gets people addicted

2011-04-26T15:54:27  <antimatroid> scoring would now make sense with 1v1 i think too
2011-04-26T15:54:34  <antimatroid> it didn't before, not really

2011-04-26T15:55:32  <_0x47> antimatroid: it also seems (dunno if already fixed in git) that the scoring doesn't work in the c++ starter pack. you search for the string "scores" where the engine sends "score". but even changing that to "score" never gave me the scores. i gave up too quickly tho, didn't check further...
2011-04-26T15:55:59  <_0x47> else if(inputType == "scores") //score information
2011-04-26T15:56:01  <_0x47> that is
2011-04-26T15:56:14  <antimatroid> you only get given score information if you are the winner
2011-04-26T15:56:22  <antimatroid> or at least at the end of the game
2011-04-26T15:56:34  <antimatroid> it's up to you to try and guess what your score might be
2011-04-26T15:56:46  <_0x47> that didn't happen, or i misunderstood something.
2011-04-26T15:56:51  <antimatroid> (you wont see your ants die outside of view of other ants and any points they receive)

2011-04-26T15:57:49  <antimatroid> but you don't get given scores every tur
2011-04-26T15:57:52  <_0x47> no, i just wanted to do some stress testing (like 500 rounds) and have a log file with just the lines "win" or "loss"...

2011-04-26T15:59:51  <antimatroid> i'll talk to sigh, i would prefer scores, but i might have to just change the c++ one
2011-04-26T16:01:06  <_0x47> nice :) but i still don't get it to work
2011-04-26T16:01:11  <_0x47> need to re-check the code tho
2011-04-26T16:01:23  <antimatroid> i'll ask sigh :)
2011-04-26T16:02:57  <_0x47> besides, do you guys plan to have some beta subdomain where people could upload their sources just like for the competition? could be nice for testing and stuff. and of course it would make something like a jBotManager redundant
2011-04-26T16:05:06  <antimatroid> jBotManager is not redundant!
2011-04-26T16:05:14  <antimatroid> i suspect we'll test submissions during beta
2011-04-26T16:05:22  <antimatroid> but i think mcleopold has a tcp server too
2011-04-26T16:05:30  <antimatroid> so hopefully most of the testing can just be done there
2011-04-26T16:06:06  <antimatroid> the 2 most important things about jbotmanager were live tcp games (and easy tcp access for "beginners") and human play mode

2011-04-26T16:08:42  <antimatroid> what i'm really interested in doing with zeta is getting servers up for all past games and some other games (like variations)

2011-04-26T16:10:34  <_0x47> but to be honest i am not so sure about the ants game. it seems too random sometimes. it totally depends on how fast you grow in the beginning if you win or not. so it's totally depending on food availability around your starting ant.
2011-04-26T16:11:08  <_0x47> may as well be lack of battle intelligence, but that doesn't work as expected in that 1000ms limit
2011-04-26T16:11:12  <antimatroid> have you been using symmetric maps with symmetric food spawning?
2011-04-26T16:12:02  <antimatroid> add "--food symmetric" to play_one_game.sh :)
2011-04-26T16:12:13  <_0x47> yes, but barely

2011-04-26T16:22:18  <jaycobcoleman> I don't think python has a problem with it, because it never seems to handle the information directly, just as current_line

2011-04-26T16:24:43  <antimatroid> jaycobcoleman: i got rid of lastSeen :P
2011-04-26T16:24:53  <antimatroid> the starterbot now just gives people if a square is visible or not
2011-04-26T16:25:09  <jaycobcoleman> that's good
2011-04-26T16:26:20  <jaycobcoleman> It should be their job to decide what food in the list to be biased towards
2011-04-26T16:26:49  <jaycobcoleman> it's something to cover in strategy guides
2011-04-26T16:27:33  <antimatroid> i don't give them a food list either
2011-04-26T16:27:43  <antimatroid> i got rid of the enemies and food vector
2011-04-26T16:27:50  <antimatroid> because it's hard to give a "food" vector
2011-04-26T16:27:54  <antimatroid> i might add them back as sets
2011-04-26T16:28:25  <jaycobcoleman> are you going to make them parse the input themselves? what are you doing with enemies and food right now?
2011-04-26T16:28:37  <antimatroid> i just add the information to the grid
2011-04-26T16:28:50  <antimatroid> the information is there, they just don't have vectors of locations for enemies and food
2011-04-26T16:29:33  <jaycobcoleman> Oh I see
2011-04-26T16:30:12  <jaycobcoleman> I think you should give them sets
2011-04-26T16:31:24  <antimatroid> i'll do that once i know what's going on with "score(s)"
2011-04-26T16:31:55  <jaycobcoleman> I'd prefer scores
2011-04-26T16:32:10  <jaycobcoleman> I'll look at some other bots and see what they're doing

2011-04-26T16:56:00  <_0x471> my pathing is too intensive sometimes
2011-04-26T16:56:23  <_0x471> like if i have 200+ ants, and try to path with all of them to 1 or 2 enemy ants
2011-04-26T16:56:31  <amstan> apparently yelp is not very popular on #proggit

2011-04-26T18:07:06  <jbroman> J is actually used (esp. for code golf), but reading it can be tricky.
2011-04-26T18:07:06  <jbroman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_%28programming_language%29
2011-04-26T18:08:52  <jbroman> Quicksort is this:
2011-04-26T18:08:53  <jbroman>   quicksort=: (($:@(<#[) , (=#[) , $:@(>#[)) ({~ ?@#)) ^: (1<#)
2011-04-26T18:09:19  <mcstar> i see
2011-04-26T18:09:43  <mcstar> i still prefer the haskell version
2011-04-26T18:09:43  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-26T18:09:50  <mcstar> Tacit programming never heard of it b4
2011-04-26T18:10:21  <mcstar> so where does it shine?
2011-04-26T18:10:48  <jbroman> Code golf and confusing people, in practice.
2011-04-26T18:11:09  <jbroman> You can do computations on arrays really concisely, though for non-trivial code it's too opaque to be useful.
2011-04-26T18:11:32  <jbroman> Nonetheless, it wasn't invented as a joke language like Whitespace but is nearly as hard to read.
2011-04-26T18:13:12  <mcstar> :)
2011-04-26T18:13:12  <mcstar> im sure i will learn it

2011-04-26T21:06:28  <antimatroid> one thing that has been bugging me a lot is symmetry of games
2011-04-26T21:06:56  <McLeopold> antimatroid: http://github.com/McLeopold/TCPServer spread the word
2011-04-26T21:07:00  <antimatroid> a lot of people define a game as strict if they payoff "tensors" remain unchanged from permuting any number of the players
2011-04-26T21:07:06  <antimatroid> McLeopold: :D
2011-04-26T21:07:18  <McLeopold> don't get too excited, it doesn't work yet

2011-04-26T21:11:02  <antimatroid> that stuff wont help you very much for ai contests
2011-04-26T21:11:09  <antimatroid> it's more for general game theory
2011-04-26T21:11:21  <McLeopold> amstan: I'd hate for people to think it's official until it is somewhat functional
2011-04-26T21:11:25  <antimatroid> if you want to learn game theory, get osbornes INTRODUCTORY text
2011-04-26T21:11:41  <antimatroid> myerson and tirol & fudenbergs texts are best, but the maths might be a little over your head
2011-04-26T21:11:46  <antimatroid> tirole*
2011-04-26T21:13:56  <antimatroid> the second of those covers more, but the first probably does a better job of what is does cover
2011-04-26T21:14:13  <antimatroid> (i am by no means an expert)
2011-04-26T21:20:18  <antimatroid> McLeopold: should i see if daniel is willing to do tcp stuff for us?
2011-04-26T21:40:57  * jaycobcoleman is fiddling with IRC function :P
2011-04-26T21:41:16  <jaycobcoleman> *functions
2011-04-26T21:52:57  <_flag> antimatroid: I can't seem to find it on the wiki, what is the most recent update to the engine again?

2011-04-26T22:15:01  <_flag> antimatroid: yes
2011-04-26T22:15:12  <antimatroid> they should be on the wiki
2011-04-26T22:15:25  <_flag> I'm looking at the bot input output section

2011-04-26T22:16:00  <antimatroid> search for "You will be given information about removing food for a visible square that contained food the last time you saw it and that currently does not contain food"
2011-04-26T22:16:32  <antimatroid> you're on https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification yeah?
2011-04-26T22:17:09  <_flag> No, I was on: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ant-bot-input-output where all the other commands (w,a,d,l,etc.) are
2011-04-26T22:18:22  <_flag> So the r command can be treated as just another command that sets a square to land right?
2011-04-26T22:18:29  <antimatroid> ah sorry, i didn't make that page :P
2011-04-26T22:18:35  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-26T22:18:55  <antimatroid> you can stop wiping food information when you clear information each turn and just process the r lines
2011-04-26T22:19:10  <antimatroid> although be careful giving a list of food locations then, because you may good a food location more than once
2011-04-26T22:19:16  <antimatroid> without having cleared it
2011-04-26T22:19:25  <antimatroid> may get*
2011-04-26T22:20:44  <_flag> So the engine no longer gives food information every turn?
2011-04-26T22:22:11  <_flag> Wait, nevermind, my starter pack wouldn't be still working then
2011-04-26T22:22:50  <antimatroid> yeah, we left that coming every turn, hence the problem with storing a list of food squares
2011-04-26T22:23:10  <antimatroid> i suspect i might give it to people with a set in the c++ bot, but atm they are just not getting such a list/set/vector
2011-04-26T22:24:44  <_flag> Coincidentally because I expect all the information to be sent every turn anyway, my bot just clears all the data (except water squares) and the 'r' command doesn't do anything, although I suppose there's some tiny efficiency gains :P
2011-04-26T22:26:40  <antimatroid> yeah, it was good that we were able to add the 'r' lines while leaving everything else working
2011-04-26T22:34:30  <jaycobcoleman> I'm adding 'r' lines to the input-output wiki page
2011-04-26T22:35:32  <jaycobcoleman> is an f line given every turn that a food square is visible?
2011-04-26T22:38:18  <jaycobcoleman> also, I imagine these wiki pages are being reformatted for the website?
2011-04-26T22:47:24  <antimatroid> an f line is given every time a food square is visible yes
2011-04-26T22:47:40  <antimatroid> amstan is just going to convert the pages i think
2011-04-26T22:49:00  <jaycobcoleman> alright good
2011-04-26T22:49:33  <jaycobcoleman> I might also change the example, because it only shows setup and turn one, which doesn't allow us to show an example of an 'r' line being given
2011-04-26T22:50:46  <antimatroid> i don't want the examples to be too long
2011-04-26T22:50:49  <antimatroid> i think they are sufficient
2011-04-26T22:51:43  <antimatroid> it could be cool to keep stats on which ant managed to score the most individual points
2011-04-26T22:54:42  <jaycobcoleman> you mean within the engine?
2011-04-26T22:55:05  <antimatroid> just as a general idea
2011-04-26T22:55:11  <antimatroid> one would really want to do it engine side
2011-04-26T22:55:21  <antimatroid> i'm off to buy something to cook for lunch anyway
2011-04-26T22:56:01  <jaycobcoleman> alright, goodbye
