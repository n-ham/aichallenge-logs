2011-03-09T00:35:41  <amstan> sigh: you have very nice repos
2011-03-09T00:35:55  <sigh> amstan, what do you mean?
2011-03-09T00:36:04  <amstan> config-files and python-math
2011-03-09T00:36:19  <amstan> i think i'm gonna steal some ideas from your config-files
2011-03-09T00:36:57  <sigh> haha, no worries :)
2011-03-09T00:37:42  <sigh> There was a time when I basically went through all the bash, inputrc, vim, etc options to figure out what I wanted
2011-03-09T00:38:15  <McLeopold> sigh: how's it going?
2011-03-09T00:38:35  <sigh> no bad, still at work :)
2011-03-09T00:39:01  <amstan> McLeopold: oh... you asked me if i cherry picked before you left
2011-03-09T00:39:14  <amstan> McLeopold: what were you referring to?
2011-03-09T00:39:25  <amstan> McLeopold: to the time when i fixed lavalamp's repo?
2011-03-09T00:40:22  <McLeopold> I wanted to pull a change to 1 file I did in epsilon into epsilon-new-schema
2011-03-09T00:40:48  <amstan> McLeopold: is your change within one commit?
2011-03-09T00:40:52  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-09T00:40:57  <McLeopold> well, no
2011-03-09T00:40:58  <amstan> as in.. the commit only contains that change?
2011-03-09T00:41:11  <McLeopold> I pulled from sigh's fork, then made a change myself
2011-03-09T00:41:21  <McLeopold> so, it might be 2 or three
2011-03-09T00:41:29  <amstan> McLeopold: ok.. can you just link me?

2011-03-09T00:42:10  <Frontier> I should write books
2011-03-09T00:42:37  <sigh> Frontier: thanks
2011-03-09T00:42:53  <amstan> Frontier: http://progit.org/ was entirely done in markdown, so you could..
2011-03-09T00:43:13  <McLeopold> amstan: the last 2 commits on epsilon are mine
2011-03-09T00:43:23  <McLeopold> plus everything I pulled from sigh
2011-03-09T00:43:34  <McLeopold> there are 2 commits in the middle
2011-03-09T00:43:42  <McLeopold> but it only affects 1 file
2011-03-09T00:43:52  <McLeopold> not sure how exactly to isolate it

2011-03-09T00:46:08  <amstan> McLeopold: you just want to update the new schema branch with the changes from epsilon, right?
2011-03-09T00:46:12  <amstan> McLeopold: why not do a merge?
2011-03-09T00:46:23  <amstan> merge epsilon into new-schema
2011-03-09T00:46:36  <amstan> that should bring all changes in, including the starter packages

2011-03-09T00:47:27  <McLeopold> Part of it is a learning exercise
2011-03-09T00:47:38  <amstan> other changes in epsilon are mostly unrelated, and they should be merged in

2011-03-09T00:53:02  <McLeopold> sigh: basically, the engine would need to track ants and build a direction string as the game progresses, and also track food's start and end turn

2011-03-09T00:53:13  <sigh> McLeopold: cool, I'll have a look at that later
2011-03-09T00:53:22  <McLeopold> k
2011-03-09T00:54:10  <sigh> I think my aim tonight is just to get the engine actually running, I didn't bother to do that yesterday :P
2011-03-09T00:56:36  <McLeopold> sigh: do you run windows?
2011-03-09T00:57:04  <sigh> no, OSX laptop and Ubuntu desktop
2011-03-09T00:57:18  <McLeopold> sigh: run "make_movie.cmd maps/random4.txt 1000"
2011-03-09T00:57:36  <McLeopold> translate make_movie.cmd to osx or linux syntax then
2011-03-09T00:57:51  <McLeopold> that will create files in the viewer dir
2011-03-09T00:57:56  <sigh> ah cool
2011-03-09T00:58:10  <sigh> I might just be lazy and load up windows in parallels though :)
2011-03-09T00:58:19  <McLeopold> you can then go into the viewer dir and run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" and then hit http://localhost:8080/viewer.html
2011-03-09T00:58:30  <sigh> yup
2011-03-09T00:58:48  <McLeopold> you don't need windows, just look at the command that is running in make_movie.cmd
2011-03-09T00:59:09  <McLeopold> In fact, a little write up of how to use the engine would be nice. :)
2011-03-09T00:59:33  <McLeopold> playgame.py has lots of parser options that need to be cleaned up
2011-03-09T00:59:38  <sigh> oh lol... it's just one command :)
2011-03-09T01:00:04  <McLeopold> ok, I'm out for now
2011-03-09T01:00:09  <sigh> yeah, yesterday I just ran the Makefile which seemed to be outdated
2011-03-09T01:00:11  <sigh> cya
2011-03-09T01:00:21  <Frontier> bye
2011-03-09T01:00:42  <Frontier> there is also the -v switch which is outdated :p
2011-03-09T01:01:13  <Frontier> but the Makefile helped me understand how to use the engine

2011-03-09T01:26:02  <Frontier> I also once had a bike shed discussion with a colleague about camel-case-identifiers when applied to the 'id' suffix.
2011-03-09T01:26:37  <Frontier> I wanted to use 'id' and 'getObjectId()', he wanted 'id' and 'getObjectID()'

2011-03-09T01:31:12  <antimatroid> that's good then

2011-03-09T01:31:23  <amstan> antimatroid: tldr: Frontier broke github
2011-03-09T01:31:28  <antimatroid> yeah i saw that
2011-03-09T01:32:01  <Frontier> The sky is green.
2011-03-09T01:32:12  <antimatroid> what colour is the sky?
2011-03-09T01:32:50  <antimatroid> is that a well known lame joke?
2011-03-09T01:33:28  <Frontier> Just checking if you believe everything ;)
2011-03-09T01:34:50  <Frontier> I really need to split up my JavaScript source code. I spend more time looking up functions in it than doing productive stuff
2011-03-09T01:35:32  <Frontier> Also NetBeans is slowing down to a crawl trying to reparse the code after every change.

2011-03-09T01:47:53  <Frontier> Well, in Java I never considered that a big problem. There you have a file for every class/struct. Except stuff that is not declared public, inner classes.
2011-03-09T01:49:21  <Frontier> Maybe it is because of all the header files that I don't like it in C++. Usually I try to keep classes which are used as parts of others in the same file.
2011-03-09T01:53:38  <amstan> Frontier: feel free to split them, we can make a makefile later for making the scripts ready for production
2011-03-09T01:53:47  <amstan> Frontier: git should not track minified stuff
2011-03-09T01:54:24  <antimatroid> can one remove files from a github repo easily?
2011-03-09T01:54:28  <Frontier> amstan: that was my concern too. how about java classes? we should use the make file for them too i guess
2011-03-09T01:54:39  <amstan> Frontier: yes
2011-03-09T01:54:49  <amstan> antimatroid: what?
2011-03-09T01:55:03  <antimatroid> i don't want to do it on aichallenge, i'm planning to put my thesis stuff on there
2011-03-09T01:55:08  <antimatroid> so it's easy to work from uni or home
2011-03-09T01:55:27  <antimatroid> and then i have to learn how to use it better :P
2011-03-09T01:55:29  <amstan> antimatroid: remove files how? for what reason?
2011-03-09T01:55:41  <antimatroid> because i no longer want that file, or renamed it or whatever?
2011-03-09T01:55:56  <antimatroid> like, is there a "git remove file" command?
2011-03-09T01:55:59  <amstan> when you delete a file in git.. you can always recover it from older versions
2011-03-09T01:56:01  <amstan> yes
2011-03-09T01:56:03  <amstan> there is
2011-03-09T01:56:09  <antimatroid> okay, that was my question :)
2011-03-09T01:56:10  <amstan> but it's always possible to get the contents from it
2011-03-09T01:56:16  <antimatroid> yeah that's alright
2011-03-09T01:56:17  <amstan> once you put something in git, it'll be there forever
2011-03-09T01:56:35  <antimatroid> i just don't want the "current" version to be full of old files
2011-03-09T01:56:37  <amstan> if you mistakely commit something private like passwords, it's hard to take them out
2011-03-09T01:56:53  <antimatroid> i don't put passwords in files anyway :P
2011-03-09T01:56:54  <Frontier> lol, what a horror scenario
2011-03-09T01:56:55  <amstan> but you can definatelly remove files
2011-03-09T01:58:08  <Frontier> svn has a server side command to purge old revisions and start counting at 0 again.
2011-03-09T01:58:30  <amstan> Frontier: you can do this with git, by just removing the repo, making a new one
2011-03-09T01:58:50  <Frontier> ok, svn can keep the last n revisions :)

2011-03-09T15:40:52  <McLeopold> Frontier: what happened?
2011-03-09T15:48:50  <Frontier> I can't stand this attitude of super serious coding any moar. Although I once had this Java class named HierGeschiehtEinWunder (a wonder happens here) refering to: http://jetzt.sueddeutsche.de/upl/images/user/ae/aesch/text/regular/168501.gif
2011-03-09T15:50:06  <Frontier> in english: http://publicstrategist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/miracle.jpg
2011-03-09T15:53:00  <Frontier> It was a 8086 cpu simulator assembly to bytecode converter. And there were a lot of instructions that wouldn't fit in my class hierarchy of logical instructions, arithmetics, etc... so I put all their code in one horrible uber class with lots of ? : operators and called it ThenAMiracleOccurs. Unfortunatly it was a large class project and the teacher came about to notice that particular class.

2011-03-09T19:53:15  <bss03> @later tell McLeopold Is that correct?  I want confirmation before I update the wiki.
2011-03-09T19:53:15  <contestbot> bss03: I think that worked...

2011-03-09T20:31:40  <antiuni> has anyone ever used git through a proxy?
2011-03-09T20:32:22  <bss03> No.
2011-03-09T20:32:49  <bss03> But, git uses some curl-ish to handle HTTP, so it shoudl respect HTTP_PROXY.
2011-03-09T20:33:11  <bss03> For the git:// and ssh:// protocols, you can't use use web proxy, directly.
2011-03-09T20:33:29  <jbroman> You could possibly use a SOCKS proxy, though.
2011-03-09T20:33:44  * antiuni doesn't know very much about this stuff :)
2011-03-09T20:33:48  <bss03> ssh:// of course wants to connect on port 22 (generally) and pass binary data.
2011-03-09T20:34:20  <antiuni> "git config --global http.proxy $http_proxy" i've tried that thing, but doesn't seem to work
2011-03-09T20:34:22  <bss03> git:// isn't any better, plus it doesn't have anything like ~/.ssh/config to change its behavior.
2011-03-09T20:34:27  <antiuni> where can one actually set http_proxy?
2011-03-09T20:34:52  <bss03> export HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy.name:port/
2011-03-09T20:35:20  <bss03> (That's Linux / UNIX, I won't really know MS Windows well.)
2011-03-09T20:35:42  <jbroman> Apparently it likes the lowercase http_proxy better (for some reason).
2011-03-09T20:36:18  <bss03> I try and avoid proxies or stunnel around them.
2011-03-09T20:36:55  <antiuni> bss03: i'm trying to get it working at uni, i have no choice on the proxy :)
2011-03-09T20:37:10  <jbroman> antiuni: Your uni filters non-HTTP traffic?
2011-03-09T20:37:18  <bss03> I've configured a VPS to run ssh on port 443 and used OpenSSH to open a SOCKS proxy to avoid hitting the web proxy at an employer.
2011-03-09T20:38:04  <antiuni> jbroman: i guess? i really have no idea about these things
2011-03-09T20:38:17  <bss03> Probabaly even less expected things, too.  You give me one open, unfiltered port and I can usually bypass whatever POS filtering you have everywhere else.
2011-03-09T20:38:19  <antiuni> i still get "HTTP request failed" when doing that stuff with lower case
2011-03-09T20:38:44  <jbroman> antiuni: I assume you are using a bona fide HTTP CONNECT proxy, not one of those "phpProxy" forwarding sites, right?
2011-03-09T20:38:48  <bss03> Have you tried not using HTTP?  Does using the git:// or ssh protocol work?
2011-03-09T20:38:59  <antiuni> i'll try that
2011-03-09T20:39:02  <jbroman> (But seriously, see if you can get a proper git or ssh connection out.)
2011-03-09T20:39:30  <bss03> It's better to use git:// or ssh if you can, they are more efficent in terms of network traffic.

2011-03-09T20:41:25  <McLeopold> bss03: the priority of maps is to make sure they all get played the same amount, so you kinda ignore priorty > 1 for a while
2011-03-09T20:41:58  <McLeopold> until the priority 1 maps have been played as much as all the other maps
2011-03-09T20:42:07  <bss03> Well, janzert was basically saying that you *never* schedule a game on an old map.
2011-03-09T20:42:22  <McLeopold> that was planet wars
2011-03-09T20:42:25  <bss03> But, that may have been because of the old system.
2011-03-09T20:42:46  <McLeopold> we will retire maps, or mark them as deleted
2011-03-09T20:42:55  <McLeopold> which means I need to add another field
2011-03-09T20:43:21  <bss03> Okay, sounds like we want LFU mostly then.
2011-03-09T20:43:29  <McLeopold> LFU?
2011-03-09T20:43:57  <bss03> What's player_id in game_player?  Is that for position?  player_id = 0 means seed (module rotation, if we do that)?
2011-03-09T20:44:07  <McLeopold> yes we want lfu
2011-03-09T20:44:10  <bss03> Least Frequenty Used.
2011-03-09T20:44:22  <McLeopold> yes, it's for position
2011-03-09T20:44:54  <bss03> And user_id is just to avoid JOINs with submission, right?
2011-03-09T20:45:06  <McLeopold> player_id 0 is not seed, seed_id is seed, on the game table
2011-03-09T20:45:12  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-09T20:46:49  <bss03> Kk.  Think I know enough about the new fields to maybe do some more work.
2011-03-09T20:53:24  <antiuni> meh, i guess git isn't happening here
2011-03-09T20:53:25  <antiuni> it hates me

2011-03-09T21:53:36  <sigh> @later tell Frontier in the replay spec, why are the player names (and other data) specified by keys player<n>name, is there any reason why the key is not player_name with <n> being a parameter?

2011-03-09T21:53:45  <McLeopold> bss03: the maps and # of players are linked, so you might be right
2011-03-09T21:53:50  <sigh> (or if anyone else can answer, that would be good)
2011-03-09T21:54:06  <McLeopold> sigh: no good reason
2011-03-09T21:54:33  <McLeopold> if Frontier agree's, we can change it
2011-03-09T21:54:59  <sigh> cool, imo it makes much more sense to have the set of keys be static
2011-03-09T21:55:04  <sigh> makes parsing simpler too

2011-03-09T21:59:38  <McLeopold> Frontier was thinking a key, value where there is only ever 1 value would be easier
2011-03-09T22:03:06  <sigh> depends how you go about it I guess
2011-03-09T22:04:11  <sigh> you are either parsing the key, or parsing the value... and having to parse keys seems a bit ugly
2011-03-09T22:04:59  <McLeopold> I agree
2011-03-09T22:05:06  <McLeopold> I'll change the spec then

2011-03-09T23:48:47  <McLeopold> I think I already mentioned why.
2011-03-09T23:48:59  <amstan> there's just no need for cherry pick now
2011-03-09T23:49:12  <amstan> cherry pick makes the history messy, should only be used when there's no choice

2011-03-09T23:49:38  <McLeopold> It's not like we have a beautiful history right now.
2011-03-09T23:49:57  <amstan> that doesn't mean we should make it messier for no reason
2011-03-09T23:50:11  * jmcarthur mumbles something about darcs
2011-03-09T23:50:14  <jmcarthur> ;)
2011-03-09T23:51:01  <jmcarthur> bss03: it's coming along. i haven't worked on it in a few days though
2011-03-09T23:51:10  <jmcarthur> and i'll be leaving town for a few days soon
2011-03-09T23:51:24  <jmcarthur> and won't get to work on it during that
2011-03-09T23:51:53  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: can you take a look at this https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Starter-Pack-Guide
2011-03-09T23:52:06  <jmcarthur> bss03: it's working and is definitely more modular. now you get to pick and choose what features you actually need. i don't have all of them in yet though
2011-03-09T23:52:26  <McLeopold> and maybe expand it if needed
2011-03-09T23:53:02  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: not all of those are directly applicable to mine :\
2011-03-09T23:54:27  <jmcarthur> there's also at least one redundancy i noticed off the bat. "finish turn" and "update" should probably just be one function call
2011-03-09T23:54:38  <jmcarthur> at least, i can't think of any reason for them to be separate
2011-03-09T23:55:18  <jmcarthur> my library separates them only in that they are provided by two different monads, but in the end they get called at the same time anyway if you are using both monads (most people will)
2011-03-09T23:57:15  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: are we wanting the starters to track water at all? i don't see anything like that mentioned on the wiki page
2011-03-09T23:57:39  <jmcarthur> i have a component in my library for doing that. it's optional to use though
2011-03-09T23:59:11  <McLeopold> update would be after getting the state from the engine
2011-03-09T23:59:20  <McLeopold> finish_turn would be after sending orders
2011-03-09T23:59:35  <jmcarthur> why shouldn't the state update just be automatic?
2011-03-09T23:59:55  <McLeopold> it needs to be updated
2011-03-09T23:59:59  <jmcarthur> game loop seems to be logically the same thing too
