2011-11-24T00:00:24  <Antimony> 700 pure code, 270 comments, 33 code and comments, etc
2011-11-24T00:00:40  <Antimony> wait a moment
2011-11-24T00:00:48  <Antimony> that means most of my code is in a single file
2011-11-24T00:00:55  <Antimony> well single translation unit
2011-11-24T00:01:21  <antimatroid> most of mine is in two files
2011-11-24T00:01:25  <antimatroid> state.cc and bot.cc
2011-11-24T00:01:30  <antimatroid> i don't comment much
2011-11-24T00:01:41  <antimatroid> although i have commented more than usual so far
2011-11-24T00:01:46  <antimatroid> just so i know wtf i have done
2011-11-24T00:01:57  <Antimony> I don't comment much either
2011-11-24T00:02:02  <Antimony> but I have a lot of commented out code
2011-11-24T00:02:29  <antimatroid> i try to just throw out what i don't want
2011-11-24T00:02:39  <antimatroid> and hope i can retrieve it from a backup if absolutely necessary
2011-11-24T00:02:57  <Antimony> one of my files got so big that I split it into two and included one in the other. It's not a real header, just a source file included in another
2011-11-24T00:03:04  <thestinger> Antimony: just use git :P

2011-11-24T00:03:20  <Antimony> I should learn to use version control sometime
2011-11-24T00:03:21  <antimatroid> i ended up breaking it up into two functions

2011-11-24T00:03:41  <Antimony> but, even with version control there's a lot of quick changes where it's easier to leave stuff as comments
2011-11-24T00:03:42  <thestinger> there, all you need to know
2011-11-24T00:03:49  <antimatroid> i'm retarded with git, normally i just incrementally compress my bot and chuck it in a folder :P
2011-11-24T00:04:00  <antimatroid> git push :P
2011-11-24T00:04:08  <antimatroid> and git pull :P
2011-11-24T00:04:29  <thestinger> well, you just need to commit every change, even if they are half broken or 1-2 lines
2011-11-24T00:04:37  <antimatroid> how i use git: git pull, do stuff, git add files, git commit -m "blah", git push :P

2011-11-24T00:07:08  <antimatroid> i look forward to seeing what information people used at the end of the contest
2011-11-24T00:07:23  <antimatroid> i've done what i think are some pretty sweet functions for determining information in the last couple of days
2011-11-24T00:07:58  <thestinger> do you change behavior based on the # of opponents you think there are?
2011-11-24T00:08:13  <thestinger> or know there are if you've seen them/killed them
2011-11-24T00:08:55  <antimatroid> i'm planning to tweak how "offensive" my combat is based on #opponent and friend ants
2011-11-24T00:08:58  <antimatroid> but i haven't done that yet
2011-11-24T00:09:01  <rajanaresh> I have another stupid question. How long has it been since everyone started their code? Just curious.
2011-11-24T00:09:08  <Antimony> at least you have combat
2011-11-24T00:09:12  <Antimony> October 23 for me
2011-11-24T00:09:16  <Antimony> or 24
2011-11-24T00:09:21  <antimatroid> ie. normally i don't want to lose as many ants as the opponent
2011-11-24T00:09:31  <thestinger> oct 23rd
2011-11-24T00:09:33  <antimatroid> but if i have lots i might just go right, assuming they aren't going to kill more go on the offense
2011-11-24T00:09:58  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: i had done path finding/food collection etc. during beta months and months ago
2011-11-24T00:10:11  <antimatroid> last week i stripped that bot down to having no strategy and have built up from there
2011-11-24T00:10:25  <antimatroid> managed to write the foundations of my combat code in the last week
2011-11-24T00:10:41  <bmh> rajanaresh: probably three weeks ago? mostly rewrote the starter kit, started out with a collaborative diffusion bot -- scrapped it as too slow, trying to make a real bot no
2011-11-24T00:10:42  <bmh> w
2011-11-24T00:10:48  <antimatroid> it was like a tiny minimax thing where i consider just like offensive and defensive moves from all ants in a battle partition

2011-11-24T00:11:31  <Antimony> do you use mixed strategies?
2011-11-24T00:11:31  <antimatroid> then the real trouble comes with picking out the defensive/offensive moves
2011-11-24T00:11:35  <antimatroid> no
2011-11-24T00:11:46  <antimatroid> i don't give states a numerical value
2011-11-24T00:11:58  <antimatroid> i evaluate them to give back an Outcome, and then Outcome has an order operation
2011-11-24T00:12:10  <antimatroid> which i'm hoping totally orders the outcomes, i'm pretty sure it does
2011-11-24T00:12:31  <antimatroid> well, no, it wont be reflexive

2011-11-24T00:12:46  <antimatroid> but you're screwed if your order operation isn't transitive
2011-11-24T00:12:59  <bmh> a1k0n: here's another bad idea -- what if you simulate ant moves as a draw from a multi-variate normal distribution?
2011-11-24T00:13:00  <Antimony> why isn't yours refleive?

2011-11-24T00:13:40  <antimatroid> ie. a > a is not true
2011-11-24T00:13:46  <rajanaresh> i see two different bot's ants going back and forth sometimes. None of them want to die or something. How do they do that? Do they use minimax trees for that?
2011-11-24T00:14:03  <Antimony> no, they're just using cowardice
2011-11-24T00:14:09  <antimatroid> rajanaresh: you could probably get that from just being defensive
2011-11-24T00:14:15  <antimatroid> but yes minimax will also lead to that kind of behaviour
2011-11-24T00:14:30  <antimatroid> any ants that worry about combat will probably try and dance around until they can move in for the kill
2011-11-24T00:14:41  <Antimony> my ants won't
2011-11-24T00:14:45  <antimatroid> what's difficult is not letting your enemies just push you away and claim territory
2011-11-24T00:14:45  <Antimony> they're too stupid
2011-11-24T00:15:12  <antimatroid> you need your ants to be offensive enough to push the "battle front" into their territory
2011-11-24T00:15:17  <antimatroid> sort of like a reverse tug of war?
2011-11-24T00:15:31  <bmh> in the future, I'd like to see less lag time between the problem formulation and contest opening. Not that I'm sour-grapes'ing
2011-11-24T00:15:40  <rajanaresh> antimatroid: if they are being pushed they start pumping in more ants...its' amazing how they do it...
2011-11-24T00:16:01  <antimatroid> bmh: we never planned for it to take this long, it just toook this long to get stuff ready
2011-11-24T00:16:14  <antimatroid> if you want things to happen faster hang around after the contest and help out :P

2011-11-24T00:19:36  <LouisMartin> question related to said lag: Will the early alpha/beta testers such as Xathis be allowed to update their bot even if they had waaay more time working on theirs?  shouldn't they have at least, a deadline weeks earlier?

2011-11-24T00:25:52  <LouisMartin> Xathis is still at V1 since the very beginning of the contest. It clearly has a lot more time than anyone who began at the start line. If he end up winning, I think it would appear more fair if he had an adjusted deadline than if he simply had more than twice the time of every other contestant. But don't get me wrong, I contributed zero to this project and so I respect your decision.

2011-11-24T00:28:08  <Antimony> I think a lot of top contenders are holding back their final versions
2011-11-24T00:28:16  <LouisMartin> So having more than twice the time isn't a unfair advantage?     what would be then?
2011-11-24T00:28:20  <Antimony> including Xathis probably
2011-11-24T00:29:09  <LouisMartin> of course they are. And that's why that would be way more fair if their deadline was AT LEAST 1 week before those who began at the startline.
2011-11-24T00:30:13  <Antimony> I just don't see the problem. Development time isn't the main cosntraint here
2011-11-24T00:31:24  <LouisMartin> but it's an important one for anyone serious about winning this contest and ready to invest themselves into it
2011-11-24T00:31:50  <Antimony> Why not make it your goal to beat Xathis 1st version by the end of the contest?
2011-11-24T00:31:52  <LouisMartin> nvm
2011-11-24T00:32:01  <Antimony> Surely yo've spent more time than xathis had for his first version
2011-11-24T00:32:21  <LouisMartin> because that wouldn't be a realistic goal for me.
2011-11-24T00:32:26  <Antimony> exactly

2011-11-24T00:39:04  <bmh> a thousand years?
2011-11-24T00:39:22  <LouisMartin> my username is LouisMartin. The best rank I had was around ~450 and I'm currently developing another bot.
2011-11-24T00:40:14  <LouisMartin> Antimony: Well since I have to presume, I can only estimate on what I know: He's been a beta tester and his bot his overly dominant from day one, without any version update.
2011-11-24T00:40:40  <Antimony> when did the beta period start?
2011-11-24T00:40:42  <LouisMartin> So, between 0 minutes and infinity, I'd tend to say a few days if not more than a full week.
2011-11-24T00:40:52  <roflmao> he cheats
2011-11-24T00:40:59  <roflmao> its a conspiracy
2011-11-24T00:41:04  <bmh> LouisMartin: beta or not, a lot of smart people have been throwing the kitchen sink at this and no one has unseated him. He's clearly doing something smart.
2011-11-24T00:41:30  <Antimony> that's what I was trying to hint at
2011-11-24T00:41:48  <Antimony> clearly, the 1st version hasn't been worked on since october
2011-11-24T00:42:01  <Antimony> so other bots have at least a month with no luck unseating him
2011-11-24T00:42:17  <bmh> Antimony: xathis says that every time he tries to improve it, it gets worse!
2011-11-24T00:42:19  <LouisMartin> of course his doing something smart, but time is an advantage when developing a smart solution
2011-11-24T00:42:59  <LouisMartin> haha  I can see why. Awesome work.

2011-11-24T01:29:42  <bmh> If you want to use Haskell, I'd be happy to post most/all of my modifications to the starter bot
2011-11-24T01:29:54  <LouisMartin> bmh: I agree
2011-11-24T01:31:06  <janzert> LouisMartin: the form of the finals is pretty well set and is planned to be the same as planetwars though
2011-11-24T01:31:08  <LouisMartin> bmh: monadifications to the starter bot?   that'd be totally fun(ctional!)
2011-11-24T01:31:24  <LouisMartin> gonna love Haskell fanboy
2011-11-24T01:31:35  <LouisMartin> ..just trolling bmh ;)
2011-11-24T01:32:30  <bmh> back to coding!
2011-11-24T01:33:47  <LouisMartin> janzert: didn't participate to planetwars and tron, but I think you guys are doing a great job.
2011-11-24T01:34:02  <janzert> thanks :)
2011-11-24T01:34:09  <cyphase> LouisMartin, no. git isn't just for open source stuff :)
2011-11-24T01:34:40  <LouisMartin> cyphase: I know. I have sleeping (closed) projects there myself...
2011-11-24T01:35:17  <bmh> LouisMartin: https://gist.github.com/1390763 <-- this is what my bot looks like.
2011-11-24T01:36:19  <LouisMartin> janzert: have you ever thought about charging for an entry fee 2, 3 weeks before the submission deadline?  a few 5$ could make an interesting prizes. I doubt anyone would care to pay such a small amount
2011-11-24T01:36:37  <bmh> LouisMartin: no. :)
2011-11-24T01:36:47  <janzert> I don't think that will ever happen
2011-11-24T01:37:15  <janzert> changes the whole tone of the contest and a big reason for the contest is to get new programmers writing a bot
2011-11-24T01:37:32  <LouisMartin> bmh: you would or you wouldn't?
2011-11-24T01:38:12  <bmh> The contest is sponsored, it's largely about motivating people to educate themselves in a fun way
2011-11-24T01:38:42  <janzert> that is my primary motivation for working on the contest, since I feel it can attract new programmers to try it out and that writing your own moderately complex program is one of the best ways to really learn programming

2011-11-24T01:41:00  <janzert> hehe
2011-11-24T01:41:07  <janzert> I would like to accept donations
2011-11-24T01:41:56  <janzert> Jeff is the person that handles all the money dealings and has been a bit afk this contest
2011-11-24T01:42:29  <janzert> I'm speculating but I think the hang up now might be that he needs to get a non-profit formed to accept them first
2011-11-24T01:43:07  <LouisMartin> I see
2011-11-24T01:43:46  <LouisMartin> well, the establishment of a permanent foundation would be great

2011-11-24T01:52:12  <LouisMartin> janzert: have you heard of "Terrarium"?  an old tech demo (contest?) to show off .Net a few years ago? http://terrarium2.codeplex.com/
2011-11-24T01:53:20  <janzert> hmm, seems like I might have heard about it in passing. But no real knowledge about it no
2011-11-24T01:53:57  <LouisMartin> do you guys have already have ideas for contests in the future?
2011-11-24T01:54:54  <janzert> I try to avoid thinking about any specifics for the next contest until after the current one is finished :)
2011-11-24T01:55:16  <janzert> I have a few non-specific general ideas but nothing at all concrete
2011-11-24T01:55:44  <janzert> and so far as I know there hasn't been any discussion by the other admins either
2011-11-24T01:56:31  <LouisMartin> There's many thing that could be said about Terrarium, but the coolest feature was that you could run the app (or have it run as a screensaver) and it would "teleport" different species (bots) and have then evolve/battle/coop in your "terrarium"
2011-11-24T01:56:48  <janzert> cool
2011-11-24T01:57:18  <LouisMartin> sounds cheesy I guess, but I can imagine kids liking the idea that the creatures they code was teleporting from pc to pc and extend in this universe on a life of their own
2011-11-24T01:58:17  <janzert> One thing I will say and seems like I've seen a bit of the same sentiment from other admins is I'd like to get away from any sort of rts for the next one since the last two have been sort of rts
2011-11-24T01:58:21  <LouisMartin> yea, well I too certainly would be stressed enough with the execution of the current contest without having to stress about the next one.

2011-11-24T01:59:56  <LouisMartin> ok
2011-11-24T02:00:01  <janzert> generally applied to games
2011-11-24T02:00:11  <LouisMartin> right
2011-11-24T02:00:42  <LouisMartin> what other kind of challenge would be interesting, yet not be a RTS?
2011-11-24T02:00:50  <janzert> tron :)
2011-11-24T02:01:17  <LouisMartin> ah, so that's not considered like an RTS?
2011-11-24T02:01:32  <janzert> I haven't really thought about it too deeply
2011-11-24T02:01:35  <LouisMartin> sounds pretty real time and strategic, no?
2011-11-24T02:01:41  <janzert> nope :)
2011-11-24T02:01:51  <janzert> maybe real time tactical ;)
2011-11-24T02:02:10  <janzert> RTS generally involves multiple units and resource gathering of some sort
2011-11-24T02:02:27  <LouisMartin> yea, well played  (and right)
2011-11-24T02:02:33  <McLeopold> I thought it meant not turn based?

2011-11-24T02:03:17  <McLeopold> like me
2011-11-24T02:04:03  <janzert> but still I'd like to see something different next, anyway I'll wait till the end of december to really think about it :)

2011-11-24T02:04:38  <janzert> hehe
2011-11-24T02:04:41  <LouisMartin> but you already had a Tron contest, you would think of doing another like the last one or are you thinking about another aspect of Tron?   Pong Style?
2011-11-24T02:04:55  <janzert> beyond running them the same as planetwars?
2011-11-24T02:05:12  <janzert> LouisMartin: yeah it definitely won't be tron again
2011-11-24T02:05:33  <janzert> probably not even another aspect of tron
2011-11-24T02:06:45  <janzert> McLeopold: any ideas on narrowing (or getting rid of) the race condition on choosing the seed for matchups?
2011-11-24T02:07:00  <janzert> if we had a real transactional database it'd be simple of course
2011-11-24T02:08:44  <McLeopold> janzert: only ones that involve a rewrite
2011-11-24T02:09:02  <janzert> :(
2011-11-24T02:09:02  <McLeopold> maybe a simple 2 minute timer for no repeats or something
2011-11-24T02:09:18  <Fluxid> McLeopold: ?
2011-11-24T02:09:31  <bmh> I just went looking for a haskell library to do something I needed... then I realized I wrote such a library two years ago!
2011-11-24T02:09:35  <bmh> (you are what you eat!)
2011-11-24T02:09:37  <janzert> think moving the seed select into the matchup insert would help any?
2011-11-24T02:09:38  <McLeopold> I tried using transactions but mysql never did them right, or I was doing it wrong from php

2011-11-24T02:10:28  <McLeopold> I think you are right, we need InnoDB
2011-11-24T02:10:45  <McLeopold> Fluxid: oh, can you put up that crappy map on tcp?
2011-11-24T02:11:21  <McLeopold> janzert: also, how many cell maps should I put on official?  1000?
2011-11-24T02:11:39  <janzert> how about 20 to start :)
2011-11-24T02:11:47  <McLeopold> so...few...
2011-11-24T02:11:51  <janzert> :)
2011-11-24T02:12:13  <janzert> also I think I'd like to weight maps toward 6 or less players
2011-11-24T02:12:42  <McLeopold> any stats on game length per player?
2011-11-24T02:13:00  <janzert> not that I've looked at no
2011-11-24T02:13:13  <McLeopold> I'll use a beta distribution
2011-11-24T02:13:34  <janzert> my reason is that generally larger player maps don't distinguish between more levels of rankings in the result anyway
2011-11-24T02:14:31  <janzert> i.e. the lower player maps give more information to the rankings, but I do still want to see some of the crazy huge fights as well :)
2011-11-24T02:15:24  <McLeopold> how about at least 100 new maps?
2011-11-24T02:15:59  <janzert> do the 20 and let them run for a few days that way you can tweek the generator for any problems before adding mroe
2011-11-24T02:16:15  <McLeopold> I've been tweaking the generator for a week
2011-11-24T02:16:18  <janzert> then you can keep adding more

2011-11-24T02:16:27  <bmh> have you thought of running any multiple copies of a single bot in a matche? GreenTea v. xathis (x3) for example
2011-11-24T02:16:39  <McLeopold> I'm in a hurry because we are running out of time to introduce new maps
2011-11-24T02:17:01  <janzert> bmh: not really seeing the resource constraints we already have
2011-11-24T02:17:12  <McLeopold> janzert: what do you think I would find?
2011-11-24T02:17:22  <janzert> hard to say until you do it ;)
2011-11-24T02:17:33  <McLeopold> we've pretty much "tested" a lot of maps and games
2011-11-24T02:17:48  <janzert> I'd just rather keep adding them continually than a huge dump right now
2011-11-24T02:17:54  <McLeopold> ok
2011-11-24T02:18:11  <janzert> also I don't want to completely swamp out the other types
2011-11-24T02:18:14  <McLeopold> but my definition of a "small" amount is much larger than yours
2011-11-24T02:20:08  <McLeopold> janzert: players = max(2, int(random.betavariant(2.0, 3.0) * 10)) ?
2011-11-24T02:21:20  <a1k0n> 10 players?  madness
2011-11-24T02:21:43  <McLeopold> maybe alpha=2.5 to put the sweet spot at 4 players
2011-11-24T02:21:56  <McLeopold> a1k0n: we have 10 players now
2011-11-24T02:22:19  <a1k0n> sure enough
2011-11-24T02:22:50  <pairofdice> There's not enough duels ;)
2011-11-24T02:23:03  <a1k0n> those are like, were you lucky enough to get placed near weak opponents?
2011-11-24T02:23:05  <pairofdice> Well okay, there are
2011-11-24T02:23:07  <McLeopold> pairofdice: this would fix that
2011-11-24T02:23:19  <a1k0n> 3-5 players are good
2011-11-24T02:23:30  <McLeopold> a1k0n: on the multi hill mazes, you should be placed near all of them
2011-11-24T02:24:00  <bmh> dijkstra... how do I implement that again... :)
2011-11-24T02:24:10  <pairofdice> with wikipedia
2011-11-24T02:24:12  <janzert> yeah, sweet spot at 4 is probably good
2011-11-24T02:25:02  <a1k0n> wouldn't alpha=2 put the mode at 4 players?
2011-11-24T02:25:30  <a1k0n> or the mean rather
2011-11-24T02:26:04  <McLeopold> I'm using wolfram's widget to get the top of the curve over the 4
2011-11-24T02:26:07  <McLeopold> 0.4
2011-11-24T02:26:11  <a1k0n> if betavariant means "draw from a beta distribution"
2011-11-24T02:26:21  <McLeopold> it does
2011-11-24T02:26:35  <a1k0n> mean is alpha/(alpha+beta)
2011-11-24T02:26:46  <a1k0n> that's a fun exercise to integrate gamma functions
2011-11-24T02:26:57  <bmh> a1k0n: did your parents feed you a statistics textbook?
2011-11-24T02:27:08  <a1k0n> all that shit cancels out and the answer turns out to be obvious
2011-11-24T02:27:25  <a1k0n> my mom is a realtor and my dad is a radio personality
2011-11-24T02:28:26  <a1k0n> i learned this all like, two years ago
2011-11-24T02:29:02  <bqf> a1k0n: radio personality? please say your dad is rush limbaugh. i think most of us would have followup questions.
2011-11-24T02:29:07  <a1k0n> hahah
2011-11-24T02:29:12  <pairofdice> Oh right, beta distribution was that one
2011-11-24T02:29:18  <a1k0n> no, mostly just a dj
2011-11-24T02:30:27  <a1k0n> i heard an interview with the inventor of the 6502 recently.  he really wanted to be a dj cuz it was the cool thing to do in those days but he wasn't cut out for it
2011-11-24T02:30:32  <janzert> also wrapping it in max(2, ...) is going to produce too many 2 player maps probably
2011-11-24T02:31:37  <McLeopold> (beta * 0.8 + 0.2) * 10?
2011-11-24T02:32:05  <janzert> or at least maybe need to shift the distribution something like max(2, min(10, (random.betainvariate(2, 3) * 10) + 1))
2011-11-24T02:32:06  <McLeopold> if I round down, I won't get 10 player games...
2011-11-24T02:33:05  <bmh> a1k0n: can you recommend any good books to eat to get smarter?
2011-11-24T02:33:37  <a1k0n> im a huge fan of http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.html
2011-11-24T02:33:45  <BenJackson> antimatroid: I did do work on symmetry detection.  I haven't really incorporated it much beyond a proof of concept
2011-11-24T02:33:59  <janzert> can your overall map generator 'controller' produce all 3 types of maps at this point?
2011-11-24T02:34:11  <BenJackson> also if that orientation detecting code is yours that might be the best obfuscation of symmetry in the whole codebase ;-)
2011-11-24T02:35:56  <bmh> a1k0n: have you read Elements of Statistical Learning? (I'm told it's the anti-MacKay)
2011-11-24T02:36:16  <a1k0n> i haven't cuz its such a ripoff
2011-11-24T02:36:54  <a1k0n> but i don't get along with sampling theory
2011-11-24T02:38:00  <McLeopold> janzert: no, not yet
2011-11-24T02:38:16  <a1k0n> oh what, the pdf is free now?
2011-11-24T02:38:22  <McLeopold> but my cell maze generator can produce all types of maps used so far :)
2011-11-24T02:38:48  <a1k0n> its been on my wishlist for years
2011-11-24T02:39:02  <bmh> the pdf?
2011-11-24T02:39:09  <a1k0n> the book

2011-11-24T03:13:07  <janzert> don't think I did
2011-11-24T03:13:12  <janzert> just did it manually

2011-11-24T03:13:56  <janzert> remember for the current set I also manually filtered the generator output for good maps
2011-11-24T03:14:22  <janzert> so I probably looked at 10-20 maps for each one that made it in
2011-11-24T03:14:22  <McLeopold> by site?
2011-11-24T03:14:28  <McLeopold> sight
2011-11-24T03:14:35  <janzert> yep
2011-11-24T03:14:57  <McLeopold> take a look at what my code produces, I have the hill distance checks built in
2011-11-24T03:15:08  <McLeopold> plus the 3x3 block traversal tests

2011-11-24T03:15:46  <janzert> btw for the finals I want to be able to completely automatically produce the map set
2011-11-24T03:15:56  <janzert> yeah, give it a try

2011-11-24T03:20:51  <janzert> might need to go lower later but I'd rather start high

2011-11-24T03:21:34  <McLeopold> noi
2011-11-24T03:22:07  <janzert> it should really be an area limit but I just threw in a per dimension min and max
2011-11-24T03:22:36  <McLeopold> I allow 40000 area for 2 players, and with the hill distance checks, it's probably ok
2011-11-24T03:23:04  <janzert> yeah, the hill distance checks will hopefully take care of it

2011-11-24T04:04:44  <BenJackson> it's just a .map

2011-11-24T04:05:24  <BenJackson> you probably know most of those but --scenario and --food none are important
2011-11-24T04:05:27  <Fluxid> and to think i wanted to create "scenariobot" which would gather enough food to have X ants and take posiotions...
2011-11-24T04:05:30  <BenJackson> (food because the map is asymmetrical)
2011-11-24T04:05:57  <janzert> Fluxid: just look at how the tutorial works

2011-11-24T04:31:46  <McLeopold> janzert: the map names in the database match the ~/maps
2011-11-24T04:32:18  <janzert> and permissions are the same as the others
2011-11-24T04:32:30  <McLeopold> oh, maybe not
2011-11-24T04:33:15  <McLeopold> did we copy them to website?
2011-11-24T04:34:13  <janzert> not that I know of, it should be an alias in the apache config
2011-11-24T04:34:41  <McLeopold> http://aichallenge.org/map/cell_maze/cell_maze_p05_02.map
2011-11-24T04:34:52  <McLeopold> it is the visualizer?
2011-11-24T04:35:09  <McLeopold> or map.php
2011-11-24T04:35:37  <janzert> something in get_map_row
2011-11-24T04:35:54  <McLeopold> janzert: crap, it is the memcache :(

2011-11-24T04:36:41  <McLeopold> add_maps should clear out the memcache key...
2011-11-24T04:37:40  <a1k0n> it seems to prefer cell_maze over everything else now
2011-11-24T04:38:06  <a1k0n> is that a temporary thing to test it out?
2011-11-24T04:38:26  <McLeopold> okay, fixed, temporarily
2011-11-24T04:38:45  <janzert> a1k0n: it tries to balance the number of games played over 24 hours
2011-11-24T04:38:47  <McLeopold> a1k0n: the logic will get those maps up to where the 24 hour average is for the others
2011-11-24T04:39:25  <a1k0n> ahha
2011-11-24T04:39:28  <a1k0n> clever

2011-11-24T04:41:34  <a1k0n> that is an interesting map
2011-11-24T04:41:37  <McLeopold> that map is mean
2011-11-24T04:41:57  <a1k0n> momobot seems to be getting a shitton of games here
2011-11-24T04:42:22  <McLeopold> and by that you mean 3?
2011-11-24T04:42:30  <a1k0n> i guess.. 3 at once
2011-11-24T04:42:34  <a1k0n> i've had that before too
2011-11-24T04:43:42  <a1k0n> i'm in a game now woo

2011-11-24T04:45:52  <McLeopold> they all did different stuff
2011-11-24T04:46:25  <a1k0n> the maps seem a little too defensive for a lot of these recent matches tho
2011-11-24T04:46:53  <a1k0n> ho ho ho!
2011-11-24T04:46:56  <a1k0n> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=122571&user=432
2011-11-24T04:47:28  <janzert> map size seems to be quite a bit larger on average
2011-11-24T04:47:29  <a1k0n> i killed xathis with extreme prejudice there
2011-11-24T04:47:34  <a1k0n> yeah
2011-11-24T04:47:57  <Fluxid> so now all the games will be with new maps?
2011-11-24T04:47:58  <McLeopold> nice game
2011-11-24T04:48:16  <McLeopold> so, in that map, you need good food gathering for a good defence
2011-11-24T04:48:33  <janzert> Fluxid: only until they catch up to the number of games other maps played in the last day
2011-11-24T04:48:33  <McLeopold> all the hills are in a line, and you have to get out to the fields
2011-11-24T04:49:10  <a1k0n> yep, and all your foragers are vying for position
2011-11-24T04:50:23  <Fluxid> wtf, only duels on tcp...

2011-11-24T04:50:50  <janzert> think I'm already ready to lower the maximum hill distance ;)
2011-11-24T04:51:05  <McLeopold> janzert: 200?
2011-11-24T04:51:42  <janzert> maybe even 166
2011-11-24T04:51:48  <McLeopold> or just shrink the max map size?
2011-11-24T04:51:48  <janzert> 1000 / 6
2011-11-24T04:51:55  <janzert> maybe
2011-11-24T04:52:13  <janzert> I was using 150x150 for the initial set btw
2011-11-24T04:52:38  <janzert> but some of the maps just seem too spread out disregarding the actual size
2011-11-24T04:53:27  <McLeopold> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=122572
2011-11-24T04:54:06  <McLeopold> superior food gathering made the difference
2011-11-24T04:54:36  <a1k0n> i didn't realize the map can start with so much food on it
2011-11-24T04:54:54  <McLeopold> .75 - 1.5%
2011-11-24T04:55:02  <McLeopold> of land area, which is quite a lot
2011-11-24T04:55:22  <McLeopold> -> 1.75%
2011-11-24T04:55:24  <a1k0n> i guess so
2011-11-24T04:55:42  <McLeopold> every 10x10 block has about 2
2011-11-24T04:55:47  <Fluxid> ok, more people must connect to tcp for larger maps to work
2011-11-24T04:56:07  <janzert> does the comments in a map give you the maximum hill distance?
2011-11-24T04:56:14  <McLeopold> no
2011-11-24T04:56:22  <McLeopold> I guess I could put that in
2011-11-24T04:56:42  <janzert> e.g. I'm wondering what the distance is here http://aichallenge.org/map.php?map=cell_maze/cell_maze_p02_03.map
2011-11-24T04:57:00  <a1k0n> oh hey i got a cell maze game on your server
2011-11-24T04:57:33  <McLeopold> janzert: probably around 200
2011-11-24T04:57:45  <McLeopold> it's just a little over manhatten
2011-11-24T04:59:30  <McLeopold> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=122589
2011-11-24T05:00:52  <a1k0n> yeah these maps are huge
2011-11-24T05:02:08  <Fluxid> how about raising turn limit for finals?

2011-11-24T05:06:21  <McLeopold> http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=122611 look at the defense structures here
2011-11-24T05:06:29  <McLeopold> janzert: wipe them out
2011-11-24T05:07:07  <McLeopold> I didn't add a player count switch yet, so I hard coded it to get the right count
2011-11-24T05:07:13  <Fluxid> nice synchronized timeuts we have here
2011-11-24T05:07:31  <Anilm3> that's a cool map, where can I find the new maps?

2011-11-24T05:11:52  <McLeopold> I guess you coded for orthagonal mazes?

2011-11-24T05:14:26  <a1k0n> the ones that are huge are of questionable value

2011-11-24T05:21:52  <janzert> lol
2011-11-24T05:22:16  <McLeopold> not enough razing of hills there

2011-11-24T07:02:18  <antimatroid> it does
2011-11-24T07:02:57  <antimatroid> that was perhaps cut a bit short
2011-11-24T07:03:11  <antimatroid> McLeopold's not here
2011-11-24T07:03:34  <antimatroid> but he also should have really taken you by now
2011-11-24T07:05:36  <pairofdice> Well blue wasn't very aggressive
2011-11-24T07:06:20  <Fluxid> it does, and afair cutoff parameters are the same as in the main server
2011-11-24T07:08:47  <grwip> how is this cutoff working? is it just after a certain amount of some moves with no hill razed, or some ratio between blue and orange ants? If it's the latter it seems right that this game was cut off
2011-11-24T07:10:26  <antimatroid> would be ratio of ants involved
2011-11-24T07:10:29  <antimatroid> i don't know the specifics
2011-11-24T07:10:35  <antimatroid> you should be able to find it in the code somewhere
2011-11-24T07:11:10  <grwip> then I guess it's ok, after 50 moves with > 70 ants against < 10 ants

2011-11-24T07:25:39  <praveen> only hills
2011-11-24T07:25:58  <antimatroid> that's the kind of map a crazy maps tcp server should be used for
2011-11-24T07:26:08  <antimatroid> along with large maps and just otherwise whatever maps
2011-11-24T07:26:15  <antimatroid> large numbers of players etc.
2011-11-24T07:26:30  <antimatroid> max players is 10 with the new map format yeah?
2011-11-24T07:26:41  <antimatroid> we used to use characters for ants hills but i tihnk they're using numbers now?

2011-11-24T09:51:36  <mcstar> just open the map in vim

2011-11-24T09:54:53  <antimatroid> maybe i should just write that

2011-11-24T09:55:14  <antimatroid> and easy to do :P

2011-11-24T09:56:14  <antimatroid> no

2011-11-24T10:02:30  <antimatroid> no
2011-11-24T10:02:40  <antimatroid> just a program to convert text to text

2011-11-24T10:02:50  <mcstar> ok, i just dont see why is that good for you
2011-11-24T10:02:58  <mcstar> the engine does that anyway
2011-11-24T10:03:12  <mcstar> so is your point to do that AT ONCE?

2011-11-24T10:07:32  <mcstar> but i would have to implement map save/load
2011-11-24T10:07:36  <mcstar> and add more editing
2011-11-24T10:07:51  <antimatroid> just pop up a window with the text that i could copy would be fine

2011-11-24T10:19:00  <deltree__> I can't pathfind for more than 3 squares with more than 20 ants
2011-11-24T10:19:07  <mcstar> :S
2011-11-24T10:19:12  <antimatroid> you're doing it wrong :P
2011-11-24T10:19:17  <deltree__> of course
2011-11-24T10:19:22  <mcstar> antimatroid: not common wrong that is
2011-11-24T10:19:25  <delt0r> that sounds too slow deltree__
2011-11-24T10:19:32  <deltree__> agreed
2011-11-24T10:19:43  <delt0r> but you don't want to be finding paths from everything to everything either
2011-11-24T10:19:44  <deltree__> but I'm trying a breadth first analysis
2011-11-24T10:19:56  <antimatroid> delt0r_: most of the time i am
2011-11-24T10:20:03  <antimatroid> and i'm doing it fairly easily
2011-11-24T10:20:09  <delt0r> I don't .. you don't need to
2011-11-24T10:20:13  <antimatroid> i'm restarting the searches after moving each ant too
2011-11-24T10:20:14  <deltree__> I set targets, and I have to pathfind to find the distance for the nearest ant

2011-11-24T10:20:20  <antimatroid> you do when you do what i'm doing :P
2011-11-24T10:20:28  <delt0r> since most of the time you want closest pairs of things or something similar
2011-11-24T10:20:46  <mcstar> delt0r: are you using scenarios?
2011-11-24T10:20:51  <delt0r> ?
2011-11-24T10:20:53  <mcstar> if you do talk to antimatroid
2011-11-24T10:20:58  <mcstar> you dont, nvm
2011-11-24T10:20:58  <delt0r> guess not
2011-11-24T10:21:10  <mcstar> delt0r: you should :D
2011-11-24T10:21:11  <delt0r> what are scenarios?
2011-11-24T10:21:22  <deltree__> antimatroid what method are you using to pathfind
2011-11-24T10:21:30  <antimatroid> depends on the situation
2011-11-24T10:21:33  <mcstar> delt0r: you can start a game from any setting
2011-11-24T10:21:33  <antimatroid> either bfs or a*
2011-11-24T10:21:47  <delt0r> deltree__: you can find closest ants to food for example with a single bfs
2011-11-24T10:21:53  <deltree__> in what language?
2011-11-24T10:22:00  <antimatroid> c++
2011-11-24T10:22:07  <mcstar> pfff
2011-11-24T10:22:13  <mcstar> who uses c++ anymore?
2011-11-24T10:22:17  <antimatroid> mcstar
2011-11-24T10:22:18  <delt0r> I am using java... my path finding is taking about 5ms
2011-11-24T10:22:21  <deltree__> c++ would be faster
2011-11-24T10:22:33  <mcstar> antimatroid: i dont, i use c++11
2011-11-24T10:22:35  <deltree__> though I heard a rumor that python is compiled to c at runtime
2011-11-24T10:22:52  <deltree__> I use the term "compiled" loosely there
2011-11-24T10:22:56  <antimatroid> python is ridiculously slow
2011-11-24T10:23:02  <delt0r> deltree__: nothing is compiled to C at run time.. its compiled to machine code
2011-11-24T10:23:07  <delt0r> python is not
2011-11-24T10:23:08  <delt0r> java is
2011-11-24T10:23:09  <deltree__> I'm using c# but it's awful
2011-11-24T10:23:14  <magikmw> You're ridiculously slow! <flamewar_start>
2011-11-24T10:23:22  <delt0r> c#  has JIT too
2011-11-24T10:23:30  <mcstar> come on ppl
2011-11-24T10:23:33  <antimatroid> :P
2011-11-24T10:23:40  <liberforce> here am I with plain C :p
2011-11-24T10:23:44  <mcstar> his slowness is not because implementaiton
2011-11-24T10:23:48  <delt0r> so i would think C# should be quite fast?
2011-11-24T10:23:58  <mcstar> well, not cause of language implementation but becauseof his alg.
2011-11-24T10:23:59  <antimatroid> mcstar: you mean it is?
2011-11-24T10:24:08  <antimatroid> yeah, it's implementation not tool
2011-11-24T10:24:09  <deltree__> I'm tempted to write this f***er in some obscure language, like Shakespeare since it's not gonna work well anyway
2011-11-24T10:24:10  <magikmw> It's really a matter of coding stuff properly.
2011-11-24T10:24:11  <liberforce> delt0r: the algorithm is what gets you fast or slow
2011-11-24T10:24:34  <delt0r> liberforce: you are saying that to me like i don't know or something...
2011-11-24T10:24:39  *** ikaros <ikaros!~ikaros@dslb-188-097-070-062.pools.arcor-ip.net> has joined #aichallenge
2011-11-24T10:25:08  <mcstar> liberforce: the OP brought up the idea of language speed
2011-11-24T10:25:13  <liberforce> sorry, I missed my name completion, wanted to say that to deltree__ :p
2011-11-24T10:25:43  <deltree__> magikmw: liberforce do you think I joined the channel to get told "You're bad" or to hear what other people suggest to solve it.  So far I've heard "lower level language" and "bfs from food to ant"
2011-11-24T10:26:11  <delt0r> anyway deltree__ I think its possible you have a bug or a doing something not right that is killing your perfomance
2011-11-24T10:26:23  <mcstar> deltree__: sit back, and think about what you really want and how are you doing in now, you will see your errors
2011-11-24T10:26:31  <mcstar> it*
2011-11-24T10:26:35  <deltree__> well, I haven't implemented my stuff yet, I'm just trying to get pathfinding working on the starter bot
2011-11-24T10:26:44  <liberforce> deltree__: relax and take your pills
2011-11-24T10:26:51  <mcstar> deltree__: you quoted specific numbers
2011-11-24T10:26:59  <deltree__> yup
2011-11-24T10:27:02  <delt0r> also finding paths from everything to everthing is also not really a win.. that is O(n^2)
2011-11-24T10:27:02  <deltree__> I did
2011-11-24T10:27:03  <mcstar> how did you get them wo having a working implementation?
2011-11-24T10:27:16  <delt0r> antimatroid may have performance issues yet
2011-11-24T10:27:32  <antimatroid> ?
2011-11-24T10:27:43  <deltree__> mcstar: those are teh numbers with the starter bot, to be specific, it's 22 ants with a 3 - 5 point bfs
2011-11-24T10:27:45  <antimatroid> as in bot quality or bots ability to not timeout?
2011-11-24T10:27:47  <delt0r> antimatroid: wasn't talking to you ;)
2011-11-24T10:28:05  <mcstar> deltree__: what starter bot has bfs in it?
2011-11-24T10:28:12  <antimatroid> c++ one does
2011-11-24T10:28:21  <deltree__> mcstar: I'm trying to get bfs working in the starter bot
2011-11-24T10:28:24  <mcstar> but thats for vr2
2011-11-24T10:28:39  <deltree__> I followed the tutorial to get a feel for the code as it was written
2011-11-24T10:28:49  <delt0r> antimatroid: performance... you get more time on the "trees" if your not farting around getting all this path info you ultimately throw away
2011-11-24T10:29:07  <deltree__> I haven't yet started my own implementation, mostly because the DI in the starter c# project was difficult to work with
2011-11-24T10:29:10  <antimatroid> delt0r: my combat code is actually surprisingly fast :P
2011-11-24T10:29:11  <mcstar> deltree__: ok, obviously you want to throw that bfs out the window and strart from sratch
2011-11-24T10:29:13  <delt0r> for example
2011-11-24T10:29:22  <antimatroid> i'm breaking each battle partition down into a 2x2 game
2011-11-24T10:29:24  <antimatroid> or something like that
2011-11-24T10:29:25  <deltree__> mcstar: thus the reason I'm here
2011-11-24T10:29:36  <deltree__> accepting even lame abuse from guys like liberforce
2011-11-24T10:29:46  <mcstar> deltree__: just start coding
2011-11-24T10:30:02  <liberforce> deltree__: c'mon
2011-11-24T10:30:06  <antimatroid> i like to work things out on paper before coding :P
2011-11-24T10:30:07  <mcstar> and be sure you read the whole source of your starter bot at least once
2011-11-24T10:30:08  <deltree__> that's neither a suggestion nor a solution
2011-11-24T10:30:17  <liberforce> i just pointed the obvious
2011-11-24T10:30:41  <liberforce> language matter, but not as much as the algorithm
2011-11-24T10:30:41  <delt0r> deltree__: think your reading more into what was said that is there... tbh
2011-11-24T10:30:45  <liberforce> period
2011-11-24T10:31:08  <liberforce> no offense was intended, I don't really get astonishing results
2011-11-24T10:31:13  <mcstar> language matters much, but only when you maxed out your algorithm
2011-11-24T10:31:30  <mcstar> noone will write as fast a pathfinder in python as i can in c++
2011-11-24T10:31:43  <mcstar> might be a strong opinion, but i think its true
2011-11-24T10:31:46  <mcstar> (not in cpython)
2011-11-24T10:31:47  <delt0r> mcstar: even then, it matters less than most think.. most of it is dogma
2011-11-24T10:32:10  <liberforce> mcstar: the language limitations arise when you already in the 100 or 200 first
2011-11-24T10:32:24  <liberforce> not when at 1000+ ranks
2011-11-24T10:32:48  <liberforce> I chose C instead of python, but had to reimplement simple collection types
2011-11-24T10:32:52  <delt0r> another lang consideration is not "is C faster than X" but "can i write C that is faster?"
2011-11-24T10:32:57  <delt0r> for example
2011-11-24T10:33:06  <liberforce> but didi it on thinking I could grab some performance there
2011-11-24T10:33:27  <liberforce> delt0r: you're right
2011-11-24T10:33:47  <yamal> mcstar, speaking of this, do you find any extra few % of performance from using C++11 vs C++ or is it "just" a cleaner code w.o. performance loss? (or do you find a performance loss?? I guess optimizer is less mature for C++11 atm?)
2011-11-24T10:33:52  <mcstar> i think also that you are better off starting from a higher level language
2011-11-24T10:33:58  <liberforce> I chose C because I knew it would be easier for me to optimize it
2011-11-24T10:34:09  <mcstar> in python you might get a better idea(and faster) what you really supposed to write
2011-11-24T10:34:17  <mcstar> and then you write it in a faster language
2011-11-24T10:34:27  <liberforce> but a friend of mine had a completely different approach, and started learning D to crete his bot
2011-11-24T10:34:56  <liberforce> mcstar: Yeah, python is more for prototyping
2011-11-24T10:35:00  <liberforce> but that takes time too
2011-11-24T10:35:03  <mcstar> yamal: c++11 cant be worsely optimized than c++
2011-11-24T10:35:16  <mcstar> it only adds
2011-11-24T10:35:27  <mcstar> but i could be wrong, im a newbie
2011-11-24T10:35:34  <ikaros> well it offers hashmaps
2011-11-24T10:35:41  <mcstar> c++11 minly adds more functinality
2011-11-24T10:35:41  <ikaros> guess thats what he meant
2011-11-24T10:35:42  <yamal> Well, most are newbies on C++11 atm ;)
2011-11-24T10:35:44  <magiik> but it's not really that hard to mess with c++ and completely rehaul code quickly it's not like these bots are thousands of lines of code
2011-11-24T10:36:03  <mcstar> reaching 3k soon
2011-11-24T10:36:34  <mcstar> (not bragging, that might be a bad thing)
2011-11-24T10:36:37  <magiik> lol
2011-11-24T10:37:16  <liberforce> I'm around 1.8k lines of code in C, but far from finished
2011-11-24T10:37:38  <magiik> mebe thousands was a bad choice
2011-11-24T10:37:38  <mcstar> i know i couldnt write my bot in c
2011-11-24T10:38:03  <liberforce> well, OOP in C is quite fun ;)
2011-11-24T10:38:15  <liberforce> I'm more a GTK guy

2011-11-24T10:44:46  <liberforce> still much work...
2011-11-24T10:45:26  <mcstar> i was 399 before i uploaded this one
2011-11-24T10:45:26  <bes_> Are there going to be new maps for the final? I see some new ones today.
2011-11-24T10:45:29  <liberforce> but i'm having a hell of fun :)
2011-11-24T10:45:52  <mcstar> bes_: probably all the maps will be played before the finals
2011-11-24T10:46:44  <antimatroid> new maps will be generated for the final
2011-11-24T10:47:07  <antimatroid> the same kinds of map generators will be used though
2011-11-24T10:47:10  <antimatroid> no surprises there
2011-11-24T10:47:24  <mcstar> oh
2011-11-24T10:47:33  <mcstar> a whole new set?
2011-11-24T10:47:43  <ikaros> but they still work on the map generation so things could change
2011-11-24T10:48:06  <ikaros> yea else you could just include all maps into your "knowledge base"
2011-11-24T10:48:23  <mcstar> true

2011-11-24T10:49:05  <ikaros> yea would be pretty boring then anyways :)
2011-11-24T10:49:50  <liberforce> those who chose genetic programming will have a ard time...
2011-11-24T10:49:55  <liberforce> *hard
2011-11-24T10:50:30  <pairofdice> The visualiser overlay is horribly slow for me
2011-11-24T10:50:55  <ikaros> depends on what they evolve
2011-11-24T10:51:05  <ikaros> but they have a hard time anyways i guess :)

2011-11-24T11:18:15  <Minthos> I have quite a lot of submissions too, but that's because the server's D compiler has bugs that caused my bot to compile wrongly

2011-11-24T14:28:32  <antimatroid> hmm, i thought i had a bug but i don't
2011-11-24T14:29:16  <antimatroid> if you have a priority queue and you insert two different but "equal priority" items would you expect them to come out in the order you inserted them?
2011-11-24T14:29:40  <Anilm3> try and tell us
2011-11-24T14:29:57  <antimatroid> i'm just using the stl priority queue
2011-11-24T14:29:59  <mcstar> no
2011-11-24T14:30:06  <antimatroid> mcstar: why not?
2011-11-24T14:30:18  <mcstar> i dont know
2011-11-24T14:30:19  <bqf> antimatroid: that's implementation dependent, so i would expect whatever my language docs tell me to expect :)
2011-11-24T14:30:42  <mcstar> depends where does the algorithm inserts the new one
2011-11-24T14:30:47  <mcstar> -s
2011-11-24T14:31:14  <mcstar> ok
2011-11-24T14:31:16  <mcstar> before
2011-11-24T14:31:26  <mcstar> so no, they would come out in the same order
2011-11-24T14:31:29  <mcstar> thats my bet
2011-11-24T14:32:13  <antimatroid> i'm confused?
2011-11-24T14:32:17  <antimatroid> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/priority_queue/
2011-11-24T14:32:21  <antimatroid> that doesn't seem to help either?
2011-11-24T14:32:53  <Anilm3> antimatroid: since the documentation available doesn't help too much, isn't it easier to just try it out?
2011-11-24T14:33:32  <antimatroid> pita to set up a test case
2011-11-24T14:34:00  <antimatroid> i need to write order functions for something weakly and not partially ordered
2011-11-24T14:34:07  <antimatroid> then get an example and throw it all in :\
2011-11-24T14:35:52  <Minthos> if you need them to be ordered differently, can't you just add an incrementally less(or more) tiny value to the priorities when you insert them?
2011-11-24T14:36:09  <antimatroid> not ideal
2011-11-24T14:36:42  <mcstar> antimatroid: just consider this: it inserts the element, where the ordering is broken

2011-11-24T14:36:51  <mcstar> i.e. before the first elemnt that breaks it
2011-11-24T14:36:58  <mcstar> an equal element doesnt break it
2011-11-24T14:37:11  <mcstar> so it will skip that, and inserts it after that, before the worng one
2011-11-24T14:37:36  <mcstar> at least thats how i understand it
2011-11-24T14:37:46  <mcstar> anything else wouldnt make sense to me
2011-11-24T14:37:59  <antimatroid> it probably doesn't find the element to break with linearly though aye?
2011-11-24T14:38:12  <antimatroid> hence it probably does make sense that they wont necessarily come out in the right order
2011-11-24T14:38:23  <antimatroid> oh wait
2011-11-24T14:38:28  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-11-24T14:38:30  <antimatroid> so it should
2011-11-24T14:38:39  <Anilm3> I agree with mcstar
2011-11-24T14:39:36  <antimatroid> just to be clear, i should expect them to come out in the order added and I probably have a bug somewhere?
2011-11-24T14:40:00  <Anilm3> would it suffice a simple example with integers?
2011-11-24T14:40:12  <antimatroid> yeah i get that

2011-11-24T14:41:34  <mcstar> antimatroid: no, i think what i said, means they come out in different order
2011-11-24T14:41:50  <antimatroid> now i'm confused
2011-11-24T14:42:13  <mcstar> meaning, you get out at the end the second == element, and after that the firstly inserted one
2011-11-24T14:42:26  <Anilm3> since you only need a weak ordering function
2011-11-24T14:42:33  <antimatroid> i'm so confused right now
2011-11-24T14:42:34  <Anilm3> I believe it just depends which one is the first operand
2011-11-24T14:42:36  <mcstar> but this is a grey area
2011-11-24T14:42:45  <antimatroid> second and element are what?
2011-11-24T14:42:50  <mcstar> <= and < matters now
2011-11-24T14:43:03  <Anilm3> so I think it just depends on implementation

2011-11-24T14:51:30  <BenJackson> [11:29] <antimatroid> if you have a priority queue and you insert two different but "equal priority" items would you expect them to come out in the order you inserted them?
2011-11-24T14:51:32  <BenJackson> no
2011-11-24T14:51:43  <BenJackson> but you can add a second lesser condition on a serial number
2011-11-24T14:51:46  <bqf> reading the priority_queue docs, all it says is that priority queues satisfy the heap property. how exactly they are implemented is not mentioned (which is normal for a standards reference of course). the heap properties do not guarantee a stable sorting algorithm - meaning that you probably cannot rely on anything at all when putting in same priority items and it is _completely_ implementation dependent.
2011-11-24T14:52:26  <mcstar> yes, we know that
2011-11-24T14:52:33  <mcstar> but i tried to guess it
2011-11-24T14:53:03  <bqf> mcstar: trying to guess what gcc devs might have done usually ends in tears.
2011-11-24T14:53:14  <BenJackson> you never have to guess about STL
2011-11-24T14:53:17  <mcstar> bqf: not my tears
2011-11-24T14:53:20  <BenJackson> they're templates so the source is in the header files
2011-11-24T14:53:26  <BenJackson> you can just read it if you have a question
2011-11-24T14:53:53  <BenJackson> but bqf has it right:  priority_queue is a container adapter that satisfies the heap property and heap is not stable

2011-11-24T14:54:43  <antimatroid> i needed my ordering to not be partial
2011-11-24T14:55:09  <BenJackson> eh?
2011-11-24T14:55:40  <antimatroid> notice i'm only ordering Pair's based off their first element
2011-11-24T14:55:47  <BenJackson> yes
2011-11-24T14:55:57  <BenJackson> I would call that a partial order
2011-11-24T14:55:57  <antimatroid> pair's aren't ordered like that
2011-11-24T14:56:07  <BenJackson> right, pairs use .second as a secondary key
2011-11-24T14:56:09  <antimatroid> errr, none are partial
2011-11-24T14:56:10  <antimatroid> it's late
2011-11-24T14:56:21  <BenJackson> it's the data
2011-11-24T14:56:22  <BenJackson> oic, you don't care about the 2nd element
2011-11-24T14:56:48  <antimatroid> my point is i wanted to see that if two "equally ordered" elements that are not actually equal are added then do they come off in the order added
2011-11-24T14:56:50  <antimatroid> and the answer is no
2011-11-24T14:57:08  <BenJackson> even if they *had* the answer is still no ;-)
2011-11-24T14:57:09  <antimatroid> it needed to not be antisymmetric
2011-11-24T14:57:13  <antimatroid> that's what i wanted to say
2011-11-24T14:57:14  <mcstar> i think your example only proves that you cant rely on this
2011-11-24T14:57:21  <antimatroid> mcstar: what?
2011-11-24T14:57:22  <Anilm3> xDDD
2011-11-24T14:57:32  <antimatroid> my example shows that they don't necessarily come off in the order added
2011-11-24T14:57:39  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-24T14:57:41  <antimatroid> which means i don't necessarily have a bug
2011-11-24T14:57:45  <antimatroid> which is what i thought
2011-11-24T14:57:46  <mcstar> you cant rely on any order

2011-11-24T14:58:27  <antimatroid> it doesn't rely on them coming out in a different order

2011-11-24T14:58:49  <Minthos> ok
2011-11-24T15:00:39  <BenJackson> btw std::priority_queue isn't suitable for A* if that's what you're doing
2011-11-24T15:00:47  <antimatroid> why not?
2011-11-24T15:00:57  <antimatroid> i do do it in other places :P
2011-11-24T15:01:02  <BenJackson> I'm pretty sure you need "reduce key" for A* and priority_queue doesn't have that
2011-11-24T15:01:19  <antimatroid> pretty sure i don't :P
2011-11-24T15:01:34  <Anilm3> BenJackson: define "reduce key"

2011-11-24T15:02:45  <antimatroid> BenJackson: just check elements as you take them off if you've already found a better one?
2011-11-24T15:02:51  <BenJackson> Anilm3: In heap parlance it's one of the operations.  the heap is sorted by key.  in a min-heap the "reduce key" operation means to take an existing member, reduce its key and then bubble it up closer to the front
2011-11-24T15:03:26  <BenJackson> you can insert duplicate elements, yes
2011-11-24T15:03:35  <Anilm3> I see, thanks

2011-11-24T16:14:25  <LouisMartin> because you keep redefining "the problems" in the middle of the contest.  Not all the approchs, strategies and their algo fit every redefinition/addition you throw at them in the middle of a contest.
2011-11-24T16:14:45  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: bots should be able to work in any enviroment
2011-11-24T16:14:48  <Anilm3> this is not a redefinitions of the contest
2011-11-24T16:14:51  <LouisMartin> It's like when IT customer comes with new specs in the middle of a project; it brings the same problems.

2011-11-24T16:15:00  <Fluxid> and the spec is still the same
2011-11-24T16:15:36  <Fluxid> i don't see problems with new maps, actually i expect finals to use totally different maps than now
2011-11-24T16:15:55  <Anilm3> yeah, in my case it helped me found important flaws
2011-11-24T16:15:58  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: any environment defined in the final problem definition, of course.  but at some point you need to work with the problem defined and stop optimizing for how it's defined
2011-11-24T16:16:21  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: maps are not included in problem description and spec imo
2011-11-24T16:17:37  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: where in the specs are we told about maps with a different kind of geometry and thin border like the new cell maps?   why changes the data we have about the problem we're trying to nail?   I don't get it.
2011-11-24T16:18:14  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: where in spec we're told that maps won't change and look this or that way?
2011-11-24T16:18:37  <Fluxid> afair there is no info about geometry. there is only information about symmetry
2011-11-24T16:19:02  <Fluxid> and new maps are symmetric the same way as old ones are
2011-11-24T16:19:11  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: really??  There's MAZE as we know them (squared, thick edges) and there's RANDOM WALKS... that isn't part of the problem?  of course it is!  if you ask me to build something that fly in the sky and run on the ground, will you really presume I'll develop something that goes into the sea without mentioning it from the start?  the keyword here is _Presume_
2011-11-24T16:20:51  <Anilm3> That analogy is quite unfair
2011-11-24T16:20:56  <mcstar> it is
2011-11-24T16:20:56  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: Unless specified, we're not to code everything in case you come up with new kind of maps that comes with new challenges. Where's the limit that we should guess when the problem is a moving target?   3D maps in the final?
2011-11-24T16:21:02  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: so someone want you to create a bot which can walk in city
2011-11-24T16:21:18  <Fluxid> but then you get angry because your bot is only designed to walk in moskow but not paris?
2011-11-24T16:21:42  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: if my comparison is unfair, that one is too
2011-11-24T16:21:51  <mcstar> Fluxid: nice comparison
2011-11-24T16:22:06  <mj41> Fluxid: Yes ... I'm under 98 ms since I get start of turn ('turn \d+') ... I see ALRM was called many times but then I got e.g. 'turn  161 bot 0 timed out'.
2011-11-24T16:22:41  <UncleVasya> Traditionaly for this challenge it's a very bad idea to make any assumptions. Do not hardcode, be ready for the things that not in the game specs to be changed - it is one of the main principles.
2011-11-24T16:22:52  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: i don't see a problem. new map meet the specs. and you made a mistake optimizing bot for only one or two kinds of maps. no one said there will be no more maps
2011-11-24T16:23:37  <LouisMartin> The TYPES of maps are integral to the problem.  And Yes, if you tell me from the start that we have Open fields, Downtown and SubUrban like maps, I don't see why I wouldn't optimize for those types and coding everything just in case you'd want the bot to visit Venise
2011-11-24T16:23:57  <ruuhkis> I just can't track down my problem with the pathfinder, I am getting headache from this.. Gotta start over tomorrow :<
2011-11-24T16:24:59  <Fluxid> LouisMartin: i think you're the only unhappy one here. talk with organizers, because i'm kindo fo a fan of the new maps
2011-11-24T16:25:26  <avdg> oh well, make assumptions according the guidelines and create a bugreport if an assumption isn't right :p
2011-11-24T16:25:42  <LouisMartin> I expected more maps. I even confirm this with Janzert yesterday and was glad to hear that. What I didn't expected and don't think I should have, is to expect NEW TYPES of maps.

2011-11-24T16:29:39  <LouisMartin> The only thing that was clear related to change was about variations of specific runtime-constant and new maps, not new TYPE of maps or new TYPE of runtime-constant.
2011-11-24T16:30:28  <UncleVasya> LouisMartin: Right 2 weeks before deadline for the Planet Wars (past challenge) map generation was changed hard too. Many people argued with administration here and on forums but decision wasn't canceled.
2011-11-24T16:30:29  <pairofdice> Somebody did something map specific that broke? Good
2011-11-24T16:30:40  <Fluxid> i can't find anything about types of maps in game spec or problem desc
2011-11-24T16:30:44  <LouisMartin> the level of adaptability required when you allow for that kind of change is realistic and hurts those who don't expect it to be that deep

2011-11-24T16:34:12  <LouisMartin> Fluxid: The maps (both typed by their characteristics and their naming) themselves define implicitly the problem.
2011-11-24T16:35:40  <mcstar> LouisMartin: you made an unfounded assumption, deal with it
2011-11-24T16:35:54  <pairofdice> Indeed
2011-11-24T16:36:10  <pairofdice> There are no new types of tiles, no new types of anything
2011-11-24T16:36:23  <LouisMartin> mcstar: I disagree about it being an unfounded assumption.
2011-11-24T16:36:26  <UncleVasya> And this is about how to understand the goal of maps in the starterpack. I believe maps there are only to make your life easier so you don't need to generate them by yourself.
2011-11-24T16:37:10  <pairofdice> If such a simple thing as more organic shapes are a disadvantage to your bot, better for me
2011-11-24T16:37:11  <Minthos> LouisMartin: your assumption was not based on the rules, it was based on guesswork on your part - therefore it is unfounded
2011-11-24T16:37:55  <pairofdice> They stated from the beginning that there will be new maps
2011-11-24T16:38:00  <mcstar> i find those maps visually pleasing
2011-11-24T16:38:01  <Minthos> LouisMartin: now you have 3 weeks or so to correct your bot to not be based on unfounded assumptions

Those kind of things decided on the level of optimization vs generality tradeoff you will go for. It's just influence the whole architecture of the software...  anything that has that kind of depth should not be let to guessing and should be explicitly warned of in the form of telling the problem solver to not assume that the initial map were defining

2011-11-24T16:44:10  <a1k0n> well, i knew for a fact to expect the final maps to change.  i don't know where it says it on the website (if at all) but it's definitely part of the agreed-upon rules
2011-11-24T16:44:14  <LouisMartin> those are not unfounded assumptions when a problem that are defined both implicitly and explicitly doesn't defined well that is not to be interpreted as implicit definition. In other word: The scope of the Implicit spec should be at least well shaped in the explicit spec of the problem definition.
2011-11-24T16:44:57  <Anilm3> still talking about the maps?
2011-11-24T16:45:02  <a1k0n> another guy, Accoun, went ballistic about this exact same thing over the last three contests
2011-11-24T16:45:39  <pairofdice> Laughable
2011-11-24T16:45:57  <LouisMartin> not sure as I barely can understand the kind of english I used in my last comment .....   maps, penguin, WWII..  who knows
2011-11-24T16:46:05  <UncleVasya> heh, so you can get in touch with him and make a rebelition :)
2011-11-24T16:46:39  <amstan> here we go.. with that map problem again
2011-11-24T16:46:43  <a1k0n> anyway perhaps the website needs some clarifications about the maps.
2011-11-24T16:46:48  <pairofdice> They have stated their spec. Nowhere in there does it say anything about the ordering of water tiles
2011-11-24T16:47:11  <LouisMartin> oh, I'll be alright..   I'll get over it.
2011-11-24T16:47:12  <amstan> a1k0n: i'm sure there's a bunch of warnings on there and on the forums
2011-11-24T16:47:37  <amstan> it is up to the contestant to make test cases and check how their bot works
2011-11-24T16:47:55  <a1k0n> also, the whole live-scoreboard thing is mostly a courtesy, as it doesn't have anything to do with the final maps or rankings (necessarily)
2011-11-24T16:48:36  <LouisMartin> amstan: no, not about the type of maps but about the maps themselves; that the maps couldn't be the one in the finals. There's an important distinction between the map instances and their types (typed characteristics)
2011-11-24T16:48:47  <a1k0n> of course you could use that to justify changing attackradius.  and actually i'd be okay with that, cuz my bot is adaptable to that, but not everyone would
2011-11-24T16:48:57  <pairofdice> Type in this case is purely cosmetic
2011-11-24T16:49:02  <UncleVasya> LouisMartin: yep, now I agree that you had a right to understand maps in the starterpack as a defining part of the contest.
2011-11-24T16:49:38  <amstan> LouisMartin: i disagree
2011-11-24T16:50:09  <UncleVasya> amstan: Since people still have a problems with making assumptions I think it's good to write in several places with big green (red) literas a warning. :)
2011-11-24T16:50:17  <amstan> LouisMartin: maps can range from all empty to all flooded with water(assuming bases are connected), anything between that is fair game
2011-11-24T16:50:27  <mcstar> im very flexible, i expect the turntime will be lowered to 100ms in the finals
2011-11-24T16:50:36  <amstan> mcstar: that will probably not happen
2011-11-24T16:50:44  <Anilm3> oh please don't do that!
2011-11-24T16:50:45  * mcstar is flaming
2011-11-24T16:50:45  <amstan> mcstar: given that the java starter pack times out during parsing
2011-11-24T16:50:49  <LouisMartin> pairofdice: find me where it's said that those type are 'cosmetic'?    those typing allows for interesting optimizations which influence the architecture and the choice of algo of the bot.. this shouldn't be let to guesswork that it's only 'cosmetic'
2011-11-24T16:51:20  <pairofdice> Optimization in this case meaning "bound to break"
2011-11-24T16:51:43  <mcstar> LouisMartin: what is given: you get a fair chance on any map
2011-11-24T16:51:55  <mcstar> i.e. positioning wise
2011-11-24T16:52:05  <mcstar> hills and initial food will be distributed accordinlgy
2011-11-24T16:52:20  <mcstar> ok?
2011-11-24T16:52:40  <mcstar> now number of players, and "look and feel" of water is a variable
2011-11-24T16:52:44  <LouisMartin> amstan: why should we not assume it to go down to 100ms?    and yes, it's a point.   Possible variations makes those contest interesting, but some types of variations should be clearly stated because of how it impact how we attack the problem.
2011-11-24T16:53:18  <Anilm3> amstan: it would be nice some reassurance about the time :P
2011-11-24T16:54:11  <mcstar> that is a much more important parameter btw
2011-11-24T16:54:16  <UncleVasya> use percents :D
2011-11-24T16:54:19  <mcstar> some lower limit on turntime

2011-11-24T16:55:44  <Anilm3> UncleVasya:  me too haha
2011-11-24T16:56:10  <amstan> LouisMartin: here.. it's stated: http://aichallenge.org/specification.php#Map-Format
2011-11-24T16:56:12  <LouisMartin> pairofdice: of course it implies that!   do you really think you're making a point here?   you need to optimize in ways that respect the problem definition in terms of possible variations so as to not over-optimize and fragilize your bot. But the problem needs to be well defined to allow for any kind of optimization. I thought it was and didn't go with absolute generalization.
2011-11-24T16:56:15  <amstan> scroll down to map generator

2011-11-24T16:58:27  <LouisMartin> about the turn time...  what's the problem?  where does it says that it couldn't go down to 100ms?  you guys should anticipate that by your own logic, no?  what's the difference here?

2011-11-24T17:03:41  <LouisMartin> and now I'm done with this map thing. Any "fighting" atmosphere here about such thing isn't worth it for anyone. I just wanted to make my point and get some answers and that's done.  thanks for the arguing as it's way better than being ignored in any case.
2011-11-24T17:03:41  <a1k0n> no that's my current one, in 7th place
2011-11-24T17:04:02  <a1k0n> since my moves are scored with linear combinations, there are cases where moving away from some food in order to move towards other food results in... that.
2011-11-24T17:04:10  <a1k0n> it's pretty dumb.
2011-11-24T17:04:21  <LouisMartin> UncleVasya: hehe, yea, I will.  thanks
2011-11-24T17:04:26  <mcstar> a1k0n: im actually surprised that it couldnt handle tha tie

2011-11-24T18:21:50  <LouisMartin> C# and VB has a similar problem and is caused - in part - by the garbage collector. Any GC in Python?
2011-11-24T18:23:07  <HaraKiri> that's what came into my mind too. but there's really no way  fixing that, right?
2011-11-24T18:23:48  <HaraKiri> oh, google says you can actually control python's gc. hmm might be worth a look

2011-11-24T18:26:06  <LouisMartin> Controlling GC in your code?  if that's possible in Python. Also, some types are causing more/longer garbage collection than others. ex: Struct vs Class. You may also look into that.
2011-11-24T18:27:31  <HaraKiri> well there's no structs in python. hmm disabling the gc did not help :(
2011-11-24T18:28:06  <LouisMartin> exact same symptoms (the random peaks)?
2011-11-24T18:29:17  <HaraKiri> yes, bot behaviour is identical, just time losses (up to 80ms) at random turns, and even in random positions in code (i plastered it with timers to find the cause)
2011-11-24T18:30:40  <LouisMartin> ok. sorry then, no idea.

2011-11-24T18:34:04  <HaraKiri> can random harddisk slowdowns be a problem of that magnitude? but 80ms or so are sooo long

2011-11-24T18:38:29  <HaraKiri> nah, just tried disabling everything but one tiny line at end of program - didn't change anything. this is frustrating :(. i'll let it run on other computers. but thanks for your support

2011-11-24T20:16:25  <Antimony> is something weird going on with the channel?
2011-11-24T20:16:33  <amstan> Antimony: no?
2011-11-24T20:17:03  <Antimony> oh
2011-11-24T20:17:10  <Antimony> for a while people kept randomly joining and leaving
2011-11-24T20:17:27  <avdg> everything is fine :-) *waits 5 sec before the world calapses*
2011-11-24T20:17:29  <amstan> well.. that's the nature of irc, kinda random
2011-11-24T20:17:58  <amstan> can someone ping me?
2011-11-24T20:18:03  <amstan> to test something
2011-11-24T20:18:18  <Antimony> I've never seen it happen before
2011-11-24T20:18:26  <Antimony> it was all green and yellow, no actual chatting
2011-11-24T20:18:33  <amstan> ok.. or not
2011-11-24T20:18:35  <amstan> @botdoc
2011-11-24T20:18:36  <contestbot> amstan: botdoc could be (#1) http://ubottu.com/stdin/supydocs/plugins/, or (#2) http://supybook.fealdia.org/devel/, or (#3) http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gribble/index.php?title=Supybot_Resources.
2011-11-24T20:18:40  * avdg trusts someone is already pinging
2011-11-24T20:19:04  <Antimony> and now the moment of truth. Does my shiny new bot design actually not suck too much?
2011-11-24T20:19:30  <avdg> hmm visible design, or behavior design? :p
2011-11-24T20:20:14  <Antimony> what would visible design even be?
2011-11-24T20:20:15  * avdg needs link as well
2011-11-24T20:20:24  <avdg> triangles?

2011-11-24T20:21:36  <Antimony> well my bot will now occsionally do smart combat
2011-11-24T20:21:41  <Antimony> but it doesn't apepar to be enough to make a differenc
2011-11-24T20:22:16  <Antimony> It took 4th out of 7 agaisnt previous versions of my bot
2011-11-24T20:22:22  <Antimony> :(
2011-11-24T20:22:23  <avdg> well, mine doesn't even know the definition of attacking
2011-11-24T20:22:35  <avdg> and I'm rebuilding my bot from js to c++
2011-11-24T20:22:53  <avdg> I would probably mis the deadline
