2010-09-23T00:25:22  <antimatroid1> somehow my new bot hasn't lost on main server since last night
2010-09-23T00:25:37  <antimatroid1> although hasn't really been challenged yet either, i expect it to crumple when it does following tcp testing of it
2010-09-23T00:28:18  <Zaphus> which one is yours ?  youwillfail ?
2010-09-23T00:28:56  <antimatroid1> yep
2010-09-23T00:29:24  <Zaphus> nice, I expect we'll play off soon since we're ranked next to each other - I dont like my chances there :-)
2010-09-23T00:29:56  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure this bot is much better than my other, i just haven't had time to debug everything and iron things out
2010-09-23T00:30:03  <Zaphus> what time did you upload ?
2010-09-23T00:30:04  <antimatroid1> it's certainly beatable
2010-09-23T00:30:09  <antimatroid1> like 3 40am :P
2010-09-23T00:30:38  <Zaphus> ouch, I hit my midnight target more or less - and was in the top 20 just 8-10 hours later

2010-09-23T01:16:55  <pjreddie> So. I think best strategy, i just need a line of code that reverts to RageBot if the starting planets are close together.
2010-09-23T01:18:04  <antimatroid1> i don't think that's a very good strategy at all
2010-09-23T01:18:19  <antimatroid1> but it's not hard to fix it up so that you at least draw with ragebot
2010-09-23T01:23:54  <antimatroid1> damnit i wish the server would give me another game
2010-09-23T01:24:04  <antimatroid1> although even time i wait like this i always end up losing aha

2010-09-23T03:44:07  <wvdschel> Hi. I've got a few suggestions for the site.
2010-09-23T03:44:13  <wvdschel> 1st: maybe mention the android version of Galcon, since you're google sponsored and all
2010-09-23T03:45:01  <wvdschel> 2nd: galcon is not an original idea. it's been in kde-games for years under the name of Konquest. I'm pretty sure that's not original either, but I don't know any earlier example of the same idea
2010-09-23T03:45:21  <wvdschel> so you might want to look up what the real origin of the game is
2010-09-23T03:47:26  <antimatroid1> meh
2010-09-23T03:47:38  <antimatroid1> would you like people to find the absolute origin of anything when referring to it?
2010-09-23T03:47:58  <antimatroid1> also, i'm pretty sure galcon is actually older than most people think
2010-09-23T03:49:19  <EvGenius> antimatroid1, are you an admin or a participant?

2010-09-23T03:58:17  <boegel> was this fixed recently in tcp.c or something?
2010-09-23T03:58:37  <boegel> my version is from 2 days ago

2010-09-23T04:05:18  <EvGenius> I dream about a contest where when you submit a bot it always gets compiled or you get errors emailed. and then, if it's compiled, it always starts playing matches, without the need for you to contact admins every time. I dream about a contest where starter packs contain proper PlayGame and ShowGame that doesn't have stupid bugs that cause differences in results
2010-09-23T04:06:21  <aerique> EvGenius: get coding then!
2010-09-23T04:06:37  <greghaynes> bah, they try, host your own if you can do better, well participate
2010-09-23T04:08:35  <EvGenius> too much work :) I hardly can get spare time to code my bot
2010-09-23T04:09:43  <aerique> EvGenius: i've been dreaming about good OSes and programming languages for 20+ years now :)
2010-09-23T04:11:30  <EvGenius> aerique: and now you stopped dreaming and started coding them? :)
2010-09-23T04:16:32  <aerique> EvGenius: too much work
2010-09-23T04:18:19  <antimatroid1> we found our bug aha, i was using me as player 1 and them us as player 2
2010-09-23T04:19:18  <EvGenius> What I'm trying to say is, despite the amazing idea of this contest, it has frustrating poor management. Many bugs, poor servers. Look at starter packs. They look like they've been written in an hour without any testing by people who hardly know the programming language.
2010-09-23T04:20:00  <EvGenius> buggy protocol that causes problems with newlines on different platforms
2010-09-23T04:21:28  <MrCeeJ> you get what you pay for ?
2010-09-23T04:22:16  <MrCeeJ> the fact it is as good as it is and most of us have contributed nothing at all to it is amazing
2010-09-23T04:24:34  <antimatroid1> EvGenius: some people are working very hard to make the competition much better
2010-09-23T04:24:50  <antimatroid1> and the og organisers have done A LOT
2010-09-23T04:24:59  <antimatroid1> it's hard to not make some fuck ups, yet they are what are highlighted
2010-09-23T04:25:08  <antimatroid1> look at how many awesome things the competition has
2010-09-23T04:25:48  <EvGenius> I hope someday they'll finally fix all annoying bugs
2010-09-23T04:26:51  <EvGenius> because it's Sep 22nd and my bot still doesn't play matches after it compiled. seems like nothing's changed
2010-09-23T04:27:12  <antimatroid1> it should be playing a match pretty much straight away these days
2010-09-23T04:27:22  <antimatroid1> and my bot usually gets some kind of ranking within a day or so
2010-09-23T04:27:33  <antimatroid1> it's undesirable, but again, they're working on it
2010-09-23T04:27:39  <antimatroid1> you can get more test games on the tcp server
2010-09-23T04:27:50  <EvGenius> I thought they already fixed it
2010-09-23T04:28:30  <EvGenius> what about tcp server, I can't play on it. maybe my ping to the server is too big
2010-09-23T04:29:03  <antimatroid1> i have 500ms pings and manage to play on it
2010-09-23T04:29:18  <EvGenius> but I'm constantly getting timeout errors. and locally my bot never show timeouts
2010-09-23T04:29:36  <antimatroid1> set timer for much less when playing on tcp?

2010-09-23T04:42:22  <EvGenius> try to run your bot locally with the input from this game
2010-09-23T04:42:43  <boegel> how? :)
2010-09-23T04:42:57  <EvGenius> somewhere on forums there is a script to parse game data from replay and feed it to your bot
2010-09-23T04:42:58  <boegel> which map, and how do I emulate the enemy's moves? :)
2010-09-23T04:43:20  <boegel> EvGenius: how would I get game data?
2010-09-23T04:45:49  <EvGenius> you can't emulate enemy moves, but you can emulate your moves when the engine gaves you the same input (if your bot is the same and doesn't contain randomness, off course)
2010-09-23T04:46:22  <EvGenius> I believe there is a script that somehow gets game data from canvas visualizer
2010-09-23T04:46:33  <antimatroid1> i'm pretty sure it'd be an illegal move
2010-09-23T04:46:40  <antimatroid1> timeouts cause bots to be disabled yeah?
2010-09-23T04:53:19  <boegel> antimatroid1: is that marked?
2010-09-23T04:53:34  <boegel> antimatroid1: I'd be surprised if it's an illegal move
2010-09-23T04:53:44  <boegel> but if it is, I'd like to fix it

2010-09-23T05:04:11  <Tempest> Now I'm using the geometric mean of distances
2010-09-23T05:04:30  <boegel> Tempest: why geometric?
2010-09-23T05:04:57  <sigh> boegel: If you just feed the replay into your bot, it won't check time... to check time you need to log it yourself
2010-09-23T05:05:25  <sigh> boegel: same with illegal moves
2010-09-23T05:08:26  <Itkovian> Tempest: the geomean seems like the wordt choice
2010-09-23T05:08:57  <Tempest> Is there any difference?
2010-09-23T05:09:09  <Itkovian> Tempest: yes :-)
2010-09-23T05:09:14  <Tempest> between arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic means
2010-09-23T05:09:33  <Itkovian> the geomean is not suitable almost everything :-)
2010-09-23T05:10:04  <Tempest> so it's best to use the simple arithmetic mean?
2010-09-23T05:10:04  <boegel> sigh: hmmk
2010-09-23T05:11:22  <Itkovian> Tempest: I think so. You use the harmonic mean when the nominator is the constant, the arithmetic when the denominator is the constant

2010-09-23T08:44:02  <Zaphus> I'm sitting here waiting for Civ V to be released.. it says 11 hours to go :-)
2010-09-23T08:44:16  <Zaphus> would love to do some bot work, but just can't get into the mood
2010-09-23T08:44:45  <Naktibalda> I can't do anything else :)
2010-09-23T08:45:09  <Zaphus> I know the next fix I need to do requires a rewrite of a bunch of code, and throwing away code that has me in the top 20 - I know it's flawed and will never get me into the top 5
2010-09-23T08:45:46  <sigh> yeah, I know that feeling
2010-09-23T08:46:10  <sigh> I think I'm due for another re-write on the weekend
2010-09-23T08:46:17  <Zaphus> I really need a test bot that behaves like the other top bots - something I can test with locally, seems wrong to have to write a top bot just to test against!
2010-09-23T08:46:31  <sigh> :P
2010-09-23T08:47:03  <Zaphus> then again, maybe I should concentrate on beating RageBot - it still beats me on 8/100 levels I think
2010-09-23T08:47:27  <sigh> I implemented rage protection just now
2010-09-23T08:47:49  <Zaphus> how well does it work against non-rage bots ?   thats the dilemma
2010-09-23T08:48:27  <sigh> it's about as good as without
2010-09-23T08:48:44  <sigh> it owns on maps where the planets are close though
2010-09-23T08:49:08  <Zaphus> thats not bad then.  I think I know what I want to do in those cases, just have to figure out how to code it without breaking the rest of my code
2010-09-23T08:49:40  <sigh> yeah, that's always the issue
2010-09-23T08:49:51  <sigh> it's always easy to say what you want
2010-09-23T08:50:32  <sigh> my bot keeps on attacking enemies that are too far away, but I haven't been able to stop it doing that without hurting its results
2010-09-23T08:50:44  <sigh> everytime I try to change it, it makes it worse
2010-09-23T08:50:46  <Zaphus> mine too
2010-09-23T08:51:07  * Naktibalda added an attack range limit
2010-09-23T08:51:34  <Naktibalda> so in one map an opponent remained in corner plants because planets in diagonal "galaxy" were too far
2010-09-23T08:52:12  <sigh> galaxy?
2010-09-23T08:52:28  <boegel> sigh: groups of planets probaly
2010-09-23T08:52:51  <sigh> yeah, that would be my guess to just wanted to confirm
2010-09-23T08:53:12  <sigh> fun thing about talking about this game is that everyone has come up with their own terminology :D

2010-09-23T08:56:26  <Zaphus> there is always the possiblity that it isnt a bad strategy, we just think it is

2010-09-23T08:57:53  <sigh> Zaphus: yeah, I've certainly considered that, but I'm pretty sure that there are cases where my bot is just outright wrong
2010-09-23T08:58:39  <sigh> Zaphus: I think that to fix it, I have to start predicting/anticipating my opponent's actions
2010-09-23T08:58:55  <sigh> which is what requires a big re-write
2010-09-23T08:59:11  <Zaphus> sigh:  same, but I think maybe it's more rare than you think that it's wrong, which is why stopping it generally makes the bot dumber.
2010-09-23T08:59:47  <Zaphus> sigh:  I've thought about predicting the opponent too... or at least to pretend I'm playing against myself anyway
2010-09-23T09:00:13  <sigh> nah, pretending to play yourself would be bad, I think
2010-09-23T09:00:41  <sigh> it's also very dangerous, because if you are testing locally you get into a closed feedback loop
2010-09-23T09:00:55  <Zaphus> anyway, I'd better get some sleep - got an early morning tomorrow.   talk to you guys on the weekend, and lets see if we can get a couple of aussies into the top 10 (we've got 3 in the top 20 more or less now)

2010-09-23T09:16:07  <Nuriaion> i wan't to add scala or jar support to the server

2010-09-23T09:17:03  <Naktibalda> Scala has an issue allready http://code.google.com/p/ai-contest/issues/detail?id=154
2010-09-23T09:18:02  <Naktibalda> it looks like devs don't pay a lot of attention to issues, Haskel support  issue isn't closed yet
2010-09-23T09:19:59  <Naktibalda> and none of the new languages were added to Starter pack page yet
2010-09-23T09:20:09  <Nuriaion> thats why i wanted to look into it.  I believe it should be easy to add scala support. (similar to java)
2010-09-23T09:20:09  <Naktibalda> they are losing users
2010-09-23T09:20:50  * Naktibalda was a lost user too
2010-09-23T09:21:20  <Naktibalda> I have read about AI contest in DZone or reddit, came to site, saw "no PHP", went away.
2010-09-23T09:22:01  <Naktibalda> but a 2 days later I had found that it's possible to add new languages to contest (in one of these sites), so I came back

2010-09-23T10:14:03  <Olathe> mightybyte: Ahh, OK. What do you think?
2010-09-23T10:14:06  <mightybyte> I like it.
2010-09-23T10:14:25  <mightybyte> I was thinking about how to modify it to facilitate games between two haskell bots.
2010-09-23T10:14:37  <mightybyte> But I need to understand a bit more about how it works first.

2010-09-23T10:15:13  <mightybyte> What is the purpose of the reverse state monad?
2010-09-23T10:15:37  <Olathe> Oh, it's like the state monad, except you can see things in the "future" instead of the past.
2010-09-23T10:15:56  <mightybyte> Yeah, but what are you using it for?
2010-09-23T10:16:25  <Olathe> Oh, I'm using it to get the tail of the output list of each turn's moves.
2010-09-23T10:16:48  <mightybyte> Ahhh.  Why?
2010-09-23T10:16:52  <Olathe> Like in map f (x:xs) = f x:map f xs, you need the map f xs part.
2010-09-23T10:16:58  <Olathe> It lets me access that.
2010-09-23T10:17:25  <Olathe> I wrote a post on it, actually.

2010-09-23T10:19:30  <mightybyte> Any chance you'll add an in-process game facilitator to the package?
2010-09-23T10:20:03  <Olathe> What's a game facilitator?
2010-09-23T10:20:53  <Cosmo`> this is starting to baffle me
2010-09-23T10:21:04  <Cosmo`> my bot works with the test rigs they provide but falls over when i submit it!
2010-09-23T10:21:20  <mightybyte> The equivalent of PlayGame.jar, but looks like "playGame :: (Bot a, Bot b) => a -> b -> Map -> GameResult.
2010-09-23T10:21:39  <Olathe> Ahh, OK.
2010-09-23T10:21:41  <Olathe> Hmm...
2010-09-23T10:21:49  <Olathe> Let me take a look at what would be needed.
2010-09-23T10:21:57  <mightybyte> Basically, it would avoid the need to do any game serialization.
2010-09-23T10:22:37  <mightybyte> And it would all be in-process, so you could experiment by making two different bots and then playing against each other in ghci.
2010-09-23T10:23:00  <Olathe> Ahh, I see.
2010-09-23T10:23:30  <mightybyte> Something like 'playGame rageBot dualBot "map42.txt"'
2010-09-23T10:25:14  <Olathe> I'd need to reorganize things somewhat. Let me take a look into it for a while.
2010-09-23T10:25:22  <mightybyte> Ok.
2010-09-23T10:25:30  <mightybyte> You'd also need some code to resolve battles.
2010-09-23T10:26:07  <Cosmo`> interesting question ...
2010-09-23T10:26:19  <Cosmo`> are the PlayGame and ShowGame jar's supposed to spit out stderr ?
2010-09-23T10:26:28  <Cosmo`> as it seems to be consumed on my machine
2010-09-23T10:28:03  <mightybyte> Olathe: So you basically need functions departure, advancement, arrival :: BMIState -> BMIState
2010-09-23T10:28:11  <mightybyte> ...or something along those lines.

2010-09-23T15:41:46  <_W_> I am uncertain about the rules point on "behaviour conditional on the opponent's identity" - this is still fine as long as it's indirect from opponent's behaviour, right?
2010-09-23T15:42:18  <dwchandler> behavior is not identity
2010-09-23T15:43:20  <Arekku> yes no issues
2010-09-23T15:43:40  * _W_ nods at Arekku - thanks, I expected this, but wanted to be sure
2010-09-23T15:44:25  <_W_> I mean it /seems/ obvious, but then I don't see how you could figure out your opponent's identity without violating other rules in the first place
2010-09-23T15:44:30  <Arekku> btw
2010-09-23T15:44:41  <Arekku> anyone got any ideas how to reach the top in this game?
2010-09-23T15:44:57  <Arekku> true
2010-09-23T15:45:32  <Arekku> well if you for instance made your bot send 1 fleet to the enemy on the 5th turn
2010-09-23T15:45:48  <Arekku> and then made a bot to yield if it was sent a fleet on the 5th turn
2010-09-23T15:46:00  <Arekku> that wouldn't be allowed I reckon
2010-09-23T15:46:26  <_W_> you're allowed multiple bots/boths that play your own?

Right now people are spewing the requests in irc, forums, issue tracker... I feel this will be an issue for future contests as well lol
2010-09-23T18:00:25  <pgpaskar_> Or I could do it.
2010-09-23T18:00:58  <amstan> what we need is an interface to change password/profile
2010-09-23T18:01:14  <pgpaskar_> Yes that too
2010-09-23T18:01:44  <pgpaskar_> Oh also s/everything i said before about changing org/to adding new ones/
2010-09-23T18:02:04  <amstan> for organizations something new should be made
2010-09-23T18:02:16  <amstan> something like google suggest
2010-09-23T18:02:25  <amstan> so people can type it in
2010-09-23T18:02:37  <amstan> but there will still be a way to group people from the same org
2010-09-23T18:03:13  <pgpaskar_> You know what would be cool?  Someone types in their org then it searches the org list and returns a list and then an "Add new"
2010-09-23T18:03:35  <pgpaskar_> So they can type in w/e with caps or spaces or b/s and get a list of what already exists to help facilitate grouping of same org
2010-09-23T18:03:40  <amstan> yep
2010-09-23T18:03:51  <pgpaskar_> and if it doesn't they can submit an "add request" and then we'll enter it with proper caps and whatnot
2010-09-23T18:04:13  <amstan> problem is that an org could have multiple names
2010-09-23T18:04:16  <amstan> like acronyms
2010-09-23T18:04:26  <pgpaskar_> yeah
2010-09-23T18:04:38  <pgpaskar_> But we can put a red text block saying "Please type your organization name in full"

2010-09-23T18:22:20  <coventry> This game is interesting.  On move 10, both players simultaneously send reinforcements from their homeworld to the world they've taken near the center of the board.  Neither target planet was under direct threat.  Is there a common tactical or computational principle behind the simultaneous commitments?  http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4672451
2010-09-23T18:23:29  <antimatroid> gives more support to the front line to make moves
2010-09-23T18:23:37  <antimatroid> or to defend what you already own etc.
2010-09-23T18:24:19  <coventry> Don't know if I
2010-09-23T18:24:37  <coventry> ...buy that.  Doesn't explain the simultaneous decision.
2010-09-23T18:24:51  <antimatroid> both bots are very similar at the start
2010-09-23T18:25:06  <antimatroid> neither sends enough bots that they'd lose their home planet should the other player send all their ships at them etc.
2010-09-23T18:25:13  <antimatroid> enough ships*
2010-09-23T18:25:23  <Naith> and the maps are completely asymetrical :P
2010-09-23T18:25:32  <antimatroid> and they both reinforce the same "center" planet
2010-09-23T18:26:00  <coventry> Yes, that's the part I find remarkable.  Simultaneous, symmetrical commitments.
2010-09-23T18:26:22  <antimatroid> it's just both bots picking fairly similar strategies at the start
2010-09-23T18:26:28  <antimatroid> anyway i'm off to uni
2010-09-23T18:26:48  <coventry> Thanks, have fun.

2010-09-23T19:29:50  <jorge> no, when it fails ther's no email
2010-09-23T19:30:06  <amstan> jorge: is it runtime?
2010-09-23T19:30:11  <jorge> I received emails with the first versions uploaded (slight modifications of the starting kit)
2010-09-23T19:30:23  <jorge> and I run the same script here, and it works...
2010-09-23T19:30:32  <amstan> jorge: do you have the same java version?
2010-09-23T19:30:34  <jorge> I have 1.6 here

2010-09-23T19:31:46  <amstan> yes
2010-09-23T19:32:12  <jorge> can you see there the log of the error or something?
2010-09-23T19:32:20  <amstan> there's no log that i know of
2010-09-23T19:32:28  <amstan> there should be an email
2010-09-23T19:32:35  <jorge> may I pass you the code (you cannot participate right? ;) )
2010-09-23T19:32:35  <amstan> unless it's a runtime error
2010-09-23T19:32:50  <amstan> idk how to run it though
2010-09-23T19:32:55  <amstan> i'll have to compile it manually
2010-09-23T19:33:02  <amstan> and run it somehow
2010-09-23T19:33:09  <jorge> I'm playing now with the TCP client-server, and my bot compiles and runs ok
2010-09-23T19:33:25  <amstan> so what's the error? compile error?
2010-09-23T19:33:35  <jorge> yes, when I try to upload to ai-challenge
2010-09-23T19:33:38  <jorge> it uploads ok

That would be soooo bitchin. I have seen some simple online IDEs before, and I gotta say it's pretty cool. We could build something unprecedented!

2010-09-23T20:47:35  <sigh> dualbot can be beaten with simple changes the attack strategies in the start packs, while beating ragebot consistently requires implementing defense

2010-09-23T20:58:53  <chrstfer> ive looked at the cpp code. seems easy enough to follow.

2010-09-23T21:02:33  <pgpaskar_> it creates a git version control repo int he folder so you can fiddle with changes and commit them.  decide you don't like something? git checkout to rebert to an earlier state
2010-09-23T21:02:49  <pgpaskar_> You can also branch to try new things, merge them back in if you like them, abandon otherwise... it's a great tool

2010-09-23T21:32:10  <sigh> does it give you an error message after you save and quit the editor?
2010-09-23T21:32:45  <chrstfer> i type my message, then ctrl+O right?
2010-09-23T21:34:12  <sigh> sorry, I've only use a command line interface, so I'm not sure of the exact instructions for you
2010-09-23T21:34:24  <sigh> probably #git is better for this stuff

2010-09-23T21:37:24  <chrstfer> ctrl+O is the write command for debians command line editor
2010-09-23T21:37:33  <sigh> ah, ok
2010-09-23T21:37:46  <sigh> after saving quit the editor
2010-09-23T21:38:19  <chrstfer> i figured it out
2010-09-23T21:38:23  <sigh> cool :)
2010-09-23T21:39:30  <chrstfer> i never learned to write shellscript, do you know how?
2010-09-23T21:39:54  <sigh> a bit... but why do you need to?
2010-09-23T21:40:04  <chrstfer> i only ask because i want to write a shel script so i only need to specify bot name, enemy bot name and it runs the game/viewer for me...
2010-09-23T21:40:17  <chrstfer> instead of the whole longass command
2010-09-23T21:41:57  <sigh> oh just make an a function: playgame() { java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "$1" "$2" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar; }
2010-09-23T21:42:32  <sigh> $1, $2... are the arguments
2010-09-23T21:42:46  <chrstfer> thats the shellscript code?
2010-09-23T21:42:47  <sigh> oh, map is fixed in that... you can adjust as required
2010-09-23T21:42:55  <chrstfer> huh easier than i though
2010-09-23T21:42:59  <sigh> that's a function, you should be able to type it into the prompt
2010-09-23T21:43:04  <sigh> or put it in your bashrc
2010-09-23T21:43:36  <sigh> and then you can just do: playgame bot1 bot2
2010-09-23T21:43:46  <chrstfer> is it constant or do i have to do it every time i go onto the shell?
2010-09-23T21:43:59  <sigh> put it in your .bashrc if you want it automatically loaded
2010-09-23T21:44:03  <chrstfer> ok
2010-09-23T21:44:42  <chrstfer> just append it to the end?
2010-09-23T21:44:47  <sigh> yup
2010-09-23T21:45:08  <sigh> your .bashrc is run when your shell starts
2010-09-23T21:45:14  <chrstfer> yup
2010-09-23T21:45:51  <sigh> no need for shell scripts to do something simple like this :P
2010-09-23T21:46:00  <chrstfer> yaaaay! :)
2010-09-23T21:46:41  <danielvf> sigh: nice
2010-09-23T21:50:10  <sigh> here, this will probably be more useful: playgame() { java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map$1.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "$2" "$3" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar; }
2010-09-23T21:50:30  <sigh> `playgame n bot1 bot2` to play bot1 and bot2 on map n
2010-09-23T21:50:46  <Zaphus> even more useful, dont call it   log.txt   because showgame.jar trashes that file :-)
2010-09-23T21:51:17  <chrstfer> yeah i added tat already. :) thanks
2010-09-23T21:51:19  <sigh> hmmm... I have never looked at log.txt -___-
2010-09-23T21:51:23  <sigh> I probably should
2010-09-23T21:52:47  <boiserm> how does text get into log.txt?
2010-09-23T21:52:52  <boiserm> I only ever have the initalizing line
2010-09-23T21:53:27  <Zaphus> it's the log from playgame, it does sometimes contain useful info

2010-09-23T21:59:25  <Zaphus> sigh:  yeah, I'd do that if I wasnt lazy :-)  but this actually shows that something was illegal rather than just what it is.   it all helps
