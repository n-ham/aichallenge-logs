2011-08-13T10:17:12  <mleise> mcstar: No, and I think they are a bit difficult now and then. Maybe Google can help you if you want to do something specific
2011-08-13T10:17:40  <mcstar> mleise: hi
2011-08-13T10:17:55  <mcstar> well, i would like to use them to genera cpp code
2011-08-13T10:18:01  <mcstar> generate*
2011-08-13T10:18:47  <mcstar> maybe you can answer this:
2011-08-13T10:18:57  <mcstar> lets say i have a template argument, an int
2011-08-13T10:19:07  <mcstar> and the template has a loop in it
2011-08-13T10:19:31  <mcstar> does the compiler expand that loop if i use the template parameter as the upper limit for exmaple
2011-08-13T10:19:32  <mcstar> ?
2011-08-13T10:27:28  <mcstar> nicht versteht?
2011-08-13T10:28:29  <mleise> oh you wrote something
2011-08-13T10:29:49  <mleise> hmm, I don't know for sure, but I'd say that the compiler turns the template into cpp code as you said and it then depends on the compiler and settings if it unrolls the loop. So I assume yes, it does.
2011-08-13T10:31:38  <mcstar> i guess ill use it then ill be more or less sure what  it can/cant do
2011-08-13T10:31:51  <mcstar> it just feels sort of wtf
2011-08-13T10:32:19  <mcstar> you know, after learning lisp, it spoiled me, and now im in the dark as to how to use them
2011-08-13T10:32:36  <mcstar> i mean other syntax/languge contructs
2011-08-13T10:32:55  <mcstar> but this is my problem
2011-08-13T10:33:01  <mcstar> so thx

2011-08-13T10:39:16  <mleise> why do you switch to c++ anyway mcstar
2011-08-13T10:41:04  <mcstar> because those infantile people at NVIDIA thought they would choose c/c++
2011-08-13T10:41:31  <mcstar> i guess i could use fortran too, but im not in the mood...

2011-08-13T10:45:27  <mleise> If it is C you can probably bind to LISP, no? If it is C++ you're screwed of course. :p
2011-08-13T10:46:11  <mcstar> its complicated
2011-08-13T10:46:30  <mcstar> common lisp has a famous foreign function interface
2011-08-13T10:46:34  <mcstar> so thats not a problem
2011-08-13T10:46:55  <mcstar> but the vuda program is compiled with nvcc, which separates cuda code from c/c++
2011-08-13T10:47:01  <mcstar> cuda*
2011-08-13T10:47:23  <mcstar> and of course i cant interface programs this way
2011-08-13T10:47:29  <mcstar> but there is a cuda driver api
2011-08-13T10:47:49  <mcstar> which is basically no more than a c api for device initialization/execution
2011-08-13T10:48:04  <mcstar> so its possible to call those functions from lisp
2011-08-13T10:48:50  <mcstar> but i would still need to compile a c-like language code to ptx, which is an assembly laguage for a virtual machine
2011-08-13T10:49:06  <mcstar> and compile that code with the nvidia driver to device machine code
2011-08-13T10:49:14  <mcstar> which again, i could load from lisp
2011-08-13T10:49:24  <mcstar> but this is way too convoluted
2011-08-13T10:49:36  <mcstar> pycuda does something along those lines i believe
2011-08-13T10:50:05  <mcstar> it cant hurt if i pick up some c++ along the way, im not against it
2011-08-13T10:55:19  <mleise> =-O This sounds complicated, even though I knew how CUDA compiles to gfx card 'assembly'
2011-08-13T10:57:16  <mcstar> what would be nice, is if i could eliminate #define's
2011-08-13T10:57:30  <mcstar> in simulations, we have a lot of parameters
2011-08-13T10:57:57  <mcstar> and there are combinations that would be nice not to compute them by hand every time we change something
2011-08-13T10:58:15  <mcstar> and, still, the compiled program would contain them as calculated values
2011-08-13T10:58:38  <mcstar> like a macro system, that actually a whole language in itslef
2011-08-13T10:58:53  <mcstar> so with lisp macros its really easy, and would fit perfectly
2011-08-13T10:59:06  <mcstar> and thats why im asking about templates
2011-08-13T10:59:47  <mcstar> i want to write down my equations in a way that is both handy for me, and abstract, but the compiled code has no superfluous computation
2011-08-13T11:00:25  <mleise> mcstar: I see, try "-funroll-all-loops". I don't know if gcc unrolls loops on its own
2011-08-13T11:00:41  <mcstar> it doesnt matter
2011-08-13T11:00:49  <mcstar> the equations are in the device code
2011-08-13T11:00:57  <mcstar> and theres a #pragma unroll
2011-08-13T11:01:01  <mcstar> which works
2011-08-13T11:01:02  <mleise> kk
2011-08-13T11:01:19  <mcstar> but what i asked previously, was related to using loops for code generation
2011-08-13T11:02:11  <mleise> So is that template in the gfx card code or in the x86 code?
2011-08-13T11:02:36  <mcstar> i would like it to be on the divice
2011-08-13T11:02:53  <mcstar> my kernel is already templated for its data type float/double
2011-08-13T11:03:04  <mcstar> but i need more
2011-08-13T11:03:23  <mcstar> like, giving them constants through templates
2011-08-13T11:03:48  <mcstar> mykernel<<<>>><const1,const2>();
2011-08-13T11:03:56  <mleise> which is totally possible in a modern language :p
2011-08-13T11:04:13  <mcstar> and const1 const2 would be replaced by the values i put there
2011-08-13T11:04:18  <mcstar> so they are not variables
2011-08-13T11:04:19  <mleise> what does <<<>>> mean???
2011-08-13T11:04:28  <mcstar> and dont consume memory, only code
2011-08-13T11:04:41  <mcstar> <<<>>> is the execution parametrization
2011-08-13T11:05:26  <mcstar> mykernel<<<dim3(gdx,gdy,gdx),dim3(bdx,bdy,bdz),shared_mem_byte,strem_id>>>(vars);
2011-08-13T11:05:41  <mcstar> bytes*
2011-08-13T11:05:43  <mcstar> stream*
2011-08-13T11:06:26  <mleise> Is that a CUDA feature? I've never seen <<<>>>
2011-08-13T11:06:38  <mcstar> yes
2011-08-13T11:07:26  <mleise> And a C-style macro doesn't work at all?
2011-08-13T11:07:32  <mleise> For what you want?
2011-08-13T11:07:50  <mcstar> well, its not really nice
2011-08-13T11:07:58  <mleise> that's right
2011-08-13T11:08:12  <mcstar> if i cant do any other way, i will do it with simple #define's
2011-08-13T11:08:30  <mcstar> but i cant do arithmetic on them
2011-08-13T11:08:47  <mcstar> you see, lets say i have DIMX * DIMY in device code
2011-08-13T11:08:58  <mcstar> it will compute this value every time
2011-08-13T11:09:17  <mcstar> so i use a #define DIMXTIMESDIMY 324234234
2011-08-13T11:09:30  <mleise> no, don't do that :p
2011-08-13T11:09:32  <mcstar> but now, this isnt flexible, i have to hand-code it if i change DIMX,or DIMY
2011-08-13T11:09:49  <mcstar> mleise: this is the usual way
2011-08-13T11:10:06  <mcstar> in simlation code, we usually have a page of this kind of defines
2011-08-13T11:10:34  <mleise> #define DIMAREA (DIMX * DIMY)
2011-08-13T11:10:46  <mcstar> that doesnt help
2011-08-13T11:10:53  <mcstar> it gets computed every time
2011-08-13T11:11:14  <mleise> A macro gets computed by the preprocessor once
2011-08-13T11:11:41  <mleise> The device wont compute it again every execution step
2011-08-13T11:11:55  <mcstar> but does the preprocessor evaluate the multiplication?
2011-08-13T11:12:16  <mcstar> i highly doubt it
2011-08-13T11:12:24  <mcstar> it has no knowledge of the type system
2011-08-13T11:12:29  <mleise> hmm, let's find that out
2011-08-13T11:12:35  <mcstar> but templates are typed
2011-08-13T11:12:49  <antimatroid> mcstar: still need me?
2011-08-13T11:12:49  <mleise> the preprocessor maybe only knows about some INT-type
2011-08-13T11:13:01  <mcstar> i doubt that too
2011-08-13T11:13:13  <mcstar> i mean, it doesnt evaluate anything i think
2011-08-13T11:13:17  <mcstar> it has conditionalas and such
2011-08-13T11:13:40  <mcstar> #if VAR < 3 * 4
2011-08-13T11:13:43  <mcstar> does this work?
2011-08-13T11:14:07  <mcstar> (correctly? thats now even correct there)
2011-08-13T11:14:13  <mleise> antimatroid: Does C++ reduce arithmetics in macros to a single value?
2011-08-13T11:14:24  <mcstar> yeah, he is sleeping
2011-08-13T11:14:25  <antimatroid> i have no idea sorry

2011-08-13T11:14:38  <antimatroid> i;m drunk too :P
2011-08-13T11:14:41  <mleise> i have no idea - wtf (lol)
2011-08-13T11:14:43  <antimatroid> don't expect me to be of much use :P
2011-08-13T11:14:56  <mcstar> happy drinking
2011-08-13T11:15:07  <antimatroid> drinking is over, i just got home
2011-08-13T11:15:30  <mcstar> did you see my first question?
2011-08-13T11:15:34  <mcstar> it was titled to you
2011-08-13T11:16:02  <mcstar> but im not forcing you in the light of drunkenness
2011-08-13T11:16:56  <mcstar> mleise: are you coding something up right now?
2011-08-13T11:18:21  <mleise> mcstar: if the macro "#define AREA (DIMX * DIMY)" gets expanded in "int something = x * AREA" it becomes "int something = x * (3 * 2)" which the compiler can optimize to a single value, as both are literal numbers
2011-08-13T11:19:32  <mcstar> yeah, but lets say i want double precicion, or flaot
2011-08-13T11:19:35  <mleise> I assume you are right about the pre-processor not doing any calculations, so macros just 'expand'
2011-08-13T11:19:37  <mcstar> i have no control over this
2011-08-13T11:19:51  <mcstar> and the device code gets compiled by openccx
2011-08-13T11:20:01  <mcstar> or wtf, what nvcc calls
2011-08-13T11:20:03  <mleise> T something = x * T(AREA)
2011-08-13T11:20:04  <mcstar> so i cant rely on this
2011-08-13T11:20:56  <mleise> you cannot rely on the compiler merging 3 * 2 to 6? This compiler is useless -.-
2011-08-13T11:21:23  <mcstar> lets say i have 2 long double's
2011-08-13T11:21:26  <mcstar> now what?
2011-08-13T11:21:40  <mcstar> or, i want to typecast one of them
2011-08-13T11:21:42  <mcstar> or anything
2011-08-13T11:21:50  <mcstar> its not flexible
2011-08-13T11:22:11  <mcstar> 2 A compile-time constant is something that can be evaluated at compile-time, such as an integer, or the address of a global
2011-08-13T11:22:14  <mcstar> variable. There are restrictions on what can be a compile-time constant, e.g. floating point values can not be compile-time constants
2011-08-13T11:22:34  <mcstar> i dont like what this sentence tells me though
2011-08-13T11:22:50  <mcstar> its regarding template parameters

2011-08-13T11:26:50  <mcstar> did you program in cpp for money?
2011-08-13T11:27:01  <mcstar> im just guessing that you cant earn with D
2011-08-13T11:27:01  <mleise> And in D you can have floats as template parameters of course and compile time function evaluation to define some constants :p
2011-08-13T11:27:39  <mleise> Oh there was one job offer in Berlin for D1 (or C or C++)

2011-08-13T11:55:56  <jmcarthur> it makes sense for floating point not to be compile time constants
2011-08-13T11:56:19  <jmcarthur> the meaning of a floating point computation depends on global settings
2011-08-13T11:56:30  <jmcarthur> *dynamic* global settings, that is
2011-08-13T11:57:22  <jmcarthur> it could also destroy cross-compilation, aside from that
2011-08-13T11:57:46  <jmcarthur> eh, i guess not necessarily the latter
2011-08-13T11:59:32  <mcstar> well, now you have to define "makes sense"
2011-08-13T11:59:43  <jmcarthur> http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/studio/composer/en-us/2009/compiler_c/fpops/common/fpops_fp_env.htm
2011-08-13T11:59:57  <mcstar> if you look at a technology, and see its limitations, then after thinking about them, they can make sense
2011-08-13T12:00:18  <mcstar> but it doesnt mean i like to put up with something wrongly-thought-out
2011-08-13T12:01:27  <mcstar> i dont see how this is relevant
2011-08-13T12:01:53  <mcstar> i mean the link
2011-08-13T12:02:15  <jmcarthur> it means that a statically computed floating point value isn't necessarily going to be the same as a dynamically computed floating point value
2011-08-13T12:03:01  <mcstar> well, yeah, pre-runtime calculations have nothing to do with machine-state specific run-time calculations
2011-08-13T12:03:07  <jmcarthur> exactly
2011-08-13T12:03:09  <mcstar> but we knew this already
2011-08-13T12:03:40  <jmcarthur> and since floating point computations are context-dependent then performing the computations statically would be a suspicious feature
2011-08-13T12:03:42  <mcstar> but it doesnt explain why templates cant have floating point arguments
2011-08-13T12:04:12  <mcstar> the compiler usually has access to the same hardware it compiles to
2011-08-13T12:04:21  <jmcarthur> this isn't hardware dependent
2011-08-13T12:04:23  <mcstar> and if it cross-compiles, it could emulate
2011-08-13T12:04:27  <jmcarthur> this is *dynamically* dependent
2011-08-13T12:04:46  <mcstar> that doesnt matter
2011-08-13T12:04:59  <jmcarthur> you can run a computation, then change some settings, then run it again. the results will be different
2011-08-13T12:05:03  <mcstar> those parameters can be controlled when compilation occurs
2011-08-13T12:05:04  <jmcarthur> i mean pure float computations

2011-08-13T12:05:45  <mcstar> the standard would only need to define a standard environment and all is done
2011-08-13T12:07:17  <mcstar> to make myslef clear, when you write down two doubles, you multiply them, and get a result
2011-08-13T12:07:34  <mcstar> and you dont have to specify any rounding settings or flsuh to zeros
2011-08-13T12:07:41  <mcstar> its a default setting
2011-08-13T12:07:49  <mcstar> templates could have that too
2011-08-13T12:08:00  <mcstar> or whatever, i dont know them

2011-08-13T12:08:27  <jmcarthur> i just mean that the reason these are dynamically controllable is because it might matter. making it static means you lose that control

2011-08-13T12:09:29  <jmcarthur> i read it, but it wasn't clear to me. is this anything more than partial evaluation?
2011-08-13T12:09:46  <jmcarthur> or do you mean the loop question?
2011-08-13T12:10:01  <mcstar> the first is more important
2011-08-13T12:11:09  <jmcarthur> i think i would write a separate program that generates code for me. templates only go so far
2011-08-13T12:11:32  <mcstar> but are you sure templates cant do that?

2011-08-13T12:11:56  <mcstar> its is referred to as metaprogramming daman it
2011-08-13T12:12:02  <mcstar> what is so meta about it then?
2011-08-13T12:12:08  <mcstar> -a
2011-08-13T12:12:21  <jmcarthur> it generates code
2011-08-13T12:12:26  <jmcarthur> that doesn't mean it's very general
2011-08-13T12:14:01  <mcstar> they say its turing complete
2011-08-13T12:14:13  <jmcarthur> templates are really intended to allow static type parameterization. anything else they enable is just a symptom of being turing complete. unfortunately, they are turing complete, but don't provide facilities for symbolic manipulation
2011-08-13T12:14:37  <mcstar> basically htey suck
2011-08-13T12:14:42  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-08-13T12:15:24  <mcstar> i could talk about this with you too
2011-08-13T12:15:30  <mcstar> but im really short on time
2011-08-13T12:15:33  <mcstar> so excuse me
2011-08-13T12:23:36  <mleise> I look at the floating point state issue from the point that floating point operations are generally 'lossy'. So unless I really depend on rounding mode and precision settings in the FPU I'd go with the default for compile-time evaluation. In the end I'm setting up a constant so I won't expect the value of it to depend on what the FPU state is in the context it is used in.
2011-08-13T12:25:35  <mcstar> an example of lossy integer arithmetic: (int)(2<<32)
2011-08-13T12:26:32  <mcstar> well, i think i wanted to write unsigned int
2011-08-13T12:27:35  <mcstar> but the worst part of it all
2011-08-13T12:27:39  <mcstar> wait for it......
2011-08-13T12:27:44  <mleise> That's a totally different kind of loss though in practice.
2011-08-13T12:28:01  <mcstar> is that the reference implementation spits out data in .mat files
2011-08-13T12:28:11  <mcstar> i hate matlab literally
2011-08-13T12:28:13  <mleise> With floats you lose precision (and that is usually what you influence with FPU flags) and with ints you overflow
2011-08-13T12:28:41  <mcstar> overflow is a lossy for of arithmetic
2011-08-13T12:28:43  <mleise> I think my sister told me about that program.
2011-08-13T12:28:51  <mcstar> for->form
2011-08-13T12:29:52  <mcstar> floating point numbers are just like integers, the result of a computation is deterministic
2011-08-13T12:30:14  <mcstar> of course the previously mentioned registers need to be kept unchanged

2011-08-13T12:32:58  <mcstar> just as there is a default setting of these, when you use fp arithmetic at runtime
2011-08-13T12:33:08  <mcstar> there could be a similar defualt at compile time
2011-08-13T12:33:41  <mcstar> but its the "who the f cares" category for me now
2011-08-13T12:33:54  <mcstar> it seems scipy can read mat files
2011-08-13T12:33:57  <mleise> I agree. But you lose precision in the general case with FP math. I most cases that is ok
2011-08-13T12:34:31  <mcstar> not always
2011-08-13T12:34:41  <jmcarthur> i have a vendetta against floating point
2011-08-13T12:34:56  <mleise> But your point about INT arithmetic being lossy is a different for me. You don't loose more or less precision keeping the value usable, but instead get something horribly different from an overflow
2011-08-13T12:35:22  <mleise> mcstar: not always = in the general case
2011-08-13T12:35:23  <jmcarthur> int arithmetic is just modular arithmetic
2011-08-13T12:35:30  <mcstar> i mean the value may change because there are not representable numbers, but precision loss usually comes when you try to subtract numbers with huge difference in the exponentials
2011-08-13T12:35:43  <jmcarthur> modular arithmetic is well-defined and easy to reason about
2011-08-13T12:35:57  <jmcarthur> (at least when the number of bits is known)
2011-08-13T12:37:07  <jmcarthur> s/well-defined/has a simple definition/
2011-08-13T12:37:12  <mcstar> the truth is that floating point numbers suck too
2011-08-13T12:37:30  <mleise> sure let's all hate them for what they are :p
2011-08-13T12:37:31  <mcstar> i will try to use fixed point number in this simulation
2011-08-13T12:37:43  <jmcarthur> floating point is great when you need to support almost arbitrary ranges in the same number of bits
2011-08-13T12:37:51  <mcstar> because the upper/lower bound of the values of the fields is well known
2011-08-13T12:38:27  <mcstar> excuse my s's

2011-08-13T17:04:33  <demerzel[work]> i forgot who made the viewer but all the buttons are fuzzy grey
2011-08-13T17:04:38  <demerzel[work]> prob a cross-site thing idk
2011-08-13T17:29:02  <amstan> demerzel[work]: mleise did
2011-08-13T17:29:39  <demerzel[work]> is that a new name for him?  i don't remember that name at all
2011-08-13T17:29:51  <amstan> Frontier
2011-08-13T17:30:00  <demerzel[work]> @amstan tell him that in firefox 4 with noscript (with hypertriangle enabled) the buttons are greyed out
2011-08-13T17:30:01  <contestbot> demerzel[work]: An error occured while trying to show the previous error.
2011-08-13T17:30:06  <demerzel[work]> oh
2011-08-13T17:30:14  <demerzel[work]> @amstan tell him that in firefox 4 with noscript with hypertriangle enabled the buttons are greyed out
2011-08-13T17:30:15  <mleise> rumors have it I changed my nick from frontier, so people don't spam me with feture requests :)
2011-08-13T17:30:15  <contestbot> demerzel[work]: I have no idea what you mean.
2011-08-13T17:30:22  <demerzel[work]> weird
2011-08-13T17:30:25  <amstan> demerzel[work]: @ is interpreted by the bot as a command
2011-08-13T17:30:32  <demerzel[work]> oh lol
2011-08-13T17:30:34  <demerzel[work]> was like uhh
2011-08-13T17:30:37  <demerzel[work]> anyway yea
2011-08-13T17:30:40  <demerzel[work]> it's not greyed out like can't click
2011-08-13T17:30:49  <demerzel[work]> looks like some kind of secondary button state in permanent
2011-08-13T17:31:59  <demerzel[work]> idk if it's noscript or not but yea
2011-08-13T17:32:00  <mleise> demerzel: did you download a tools package? it is a regression bug in FF4 that has been fixed for FF5. I wrote a work-around though, maybe it isn't in the tools package
2011-08-13T17:32:02  <demerzel[work]> i ahve adblock too haha
2011-08-13T17:32:16  <demerzel[work]> nah haven't done any webdev, this is a new laptop
2011-08-13T17:32:37  <demerzel[work]> do you know what i mean about fuzzy grey?  can ss if not
2011-08-13T17:32:42  <demerzel[work]> assume you would know
2011-08-13T17:33:02  <demerzel[work]> mleise: my mistake, it is firefox 5.0.1
2011-08-13T17:33:23  <mleise> demerzel: Ah, I see so I have to black-list that version too
2011-08-13T17:33:29  <demerzel[work]> maybe
2011-08-13T17:33:34  <demerzel[work]> i do have a lot of anti-script stuff going on
2011-08-13T17:33:46  <demerzel[work]> between adblock plus and noscript
2011-08-13T17:34:31  <mleise> demerzel: Do you use the viewer on aichallengebeta or locally?
2011-08-13T17:34:42  <demerzel[work]> mleise: its bizarre but when i right click the button i can see the clear one through it momentarily
2011-08-13T17:34:50  <demerzel[work]> i had no idea though it was actually dynamically creating an image
2011-08-13T17:34:55  <demerzel[work]> is that new canvas functinality?
2011-08-13T17:35:00  <demerzel[work]> did view image and saw the whole viewer
2011-08-13T17:35:39  <mleise> canvas came with the option to do pixel manipulation, and draw other images/canvases into it
2011-08-13T17:35:51  <demerzel[work]> yea but i assumed it would be creation of individual images
2011-08-13T17:35:56  <demerzel[work]> cool it's just one big image
2011-08-13T17:36:03  <demerzel[work]> haven't done webdev in a while canvas is new to me
2011-08-13T17:36:08  <mleise> :p
2011-08-13T17:36:20  <demerzel[work]> not locally
2011-08-13T17:36:41  <demerzel[work]> i actually used the one i set up  which is aibeta.net-supremacy.com (my site)
2011-08-13T17:36:51  <demerzel[work]> but i double checked that aibetachallenge.hypertriangle.com does the sam ething
2011-08-13T17:36:53  <demerzel[work]> same*
2011-08-13T17:38:18  <demerzel[work]> mleise: looks like AA overage actually, looking at the names too
2011-08-13T17:38:26  <mleise> demerzel: hmm, actually I blacklisted like this: navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Firefox/5.0')
2011-08-13T17:38:56  <mleise> what do you mean by AA?
2011-08-13T17:39:01  <demerzel[work]> antialias
2011-08-13T17:39:13  <demerzel[work]> the names are heavily aa'd too
2011-08-13T17:39:15  <demerzel[work]> but still readable
2011-08-13T17:39:21  <mleise> Oo
2011-08-13T17:39:34  <demerzel[work]> idk red herring probably
2011-08-13T17:39:42  <mleise> well, the grayness comes from a bug in rendering images into a canvas with active shadow
2011-08-13T17:40:07  <demerzel[work]> mleise: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
2011-08-13T17:40:22  <mleise> then I don't know why it isn't filtered
2011-08-13T17:40:48  <demerzel[work]> is there something i can do on my end
2011-08-13T17:40:57  <demerzel[work]> to see if blacklisting whatever actually exists
2011-08-13T17:41:00  <demerzel[work]> idk what you are blacklisting
2011-08-13T17:42:10  <mleise> I'm checking if the browser agent string contains "Firefox/5.0" or "Chrome/12." and disable shadows there.
2011-08-13T17:43:15  <mleise> You could try Chrome 12, but anyway I'll take note of that and try to find a fix the next time I am on that code.
2011-08-13T17:45:41  <mleise> that reminds me that I have to check if Chrome 13 actually renders shadows with blur now.
2011-08-13T17:45:50  <demerzel[work]> im not changing browsers lol
2011-08-13T17:45:55  <demerzel[work]> its cosmetic anyway
2011-08-13T17:46:10  <demerzel[work]> btw saw the 'no repeat' option
2011-08-13T17:46:14  <demerzel[work]> awesome
2011-08-13T17:46:19  <demerzel[work]> idk how people can look at the mirrored ones without a headache
2011-08-13T17:46:38  <demerzel[work]> has anyone made an offline exe viewer yet?
2011-08-13T17:46:43  <demerzel[work]> iirc i was going to but got caught up in work
2011-08-13T17:46:45  <mleise> Changing browsers? It's a matter of having 5 of them installed in parallel for someone doing web development :p
2011-08-13T17:46:46  <demerzel[work]> which i am currently ignoring
2011-08-13T17:47:00  <demerzel[work]> nah i don't do web dev any more
2011-08-13T17:47:07  <demerzel[work]> thank god
2011-08-13T17:47:16  <demerzel[work]> some cool shit but hours of poring through css i do not miss
2011-08-13T17:47:27  <mleise> what 'no repeat' option?
2011-08-13T17:48:22  <mleise> There is no .exe viewer for windows, but there is the viewer wrapped in Java available in the tools.zip / tools.tar.gz
2011-08-13T17:48:29  <mleise> @tools
2011-08-13T17:48:30  <contestbot> mleise: tools could be Windows: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.zip | Linux/MacOS X: http://aichallengebeta.hypertriangle.com/tools.tar.bz2.
2011-08-13T17:49:54  <demerzel[work]> @demerzel
2011-08-13T17:49:55  <contestbot> demerzel[work]: I'm sorry Dave, err demerzel[work]; I cannot 'demerzel'.
2011-08-13T17:49:57  <mleise> You can pipe a live game into it using the 'stream' output of the engine or load a stored replay file
2011-08-13T17:50:05  <demerzel[work]> is it CLI?
2011-08-13T17:50:14  <demerzel[work]> assume so
2011-08-13T17:50:28  <mleise> It's explained in the wiki. it is not really CLI except for the pipe stuff :p
2011-08-13T17:50:34  <demerzel[work]> spend so much time just getting CLIs in python working for these contests haha
2011-08-13T17:52:21  <mleise> I think I can get some more speed into the visualizer at high ant counts. And the Java wrapper is always a big deal slower than the browser JS engines. Unless you use a very old browser that doesn't optimize JS with machine code generators
2011-08-13T17:53:12  <mleise> It is using the well known Mozilla Rhino engine, that is also incorporated in Eclipse for JavaScript
2011-08-13T17:53:40  <mleise> And actually even in a crippled form in JDK 1.6
2011-08-13T17:56:34  <demerzel[work]> well it looks good except for that
2011-08-13T17:56:47  <demerzel[work]> and really its not horrible of anything i just though a shadow overlay was accidentally on top
2011-08-13T17:58:48  <mleise> We need some fancy picture like for PlanetWars. "All your space is belong to us." with some weird alien. That made me want to see what the whole story is.
2011-08-13T17:59:32  <mleise> There was none, but then I saw some of the game play and then I saw how easy it is to participate and so on.
2011-08-13T18:00:27  <mleise> Today I noticed there is actually someone working at IBM, who participates in Ants with a program written in D. I thought I would end up as the only one :p
2011-08-13T18:01:21  <amstan> mleise: lol, that picture was made by pgpaskar_ in a pinch
2011-08-13T18:01:50  <amstan> mleise: if you want to get on that project i can hook you up with geartrooper, the guy who made those ants pics
2011-08-13T18:03:32  <mleise> amstan: not my construction site ;)
2011-08-13T18:05:04  <mleise> I just think a comic picture would create more interest in the contest. It's a little 'dry' at the moment. On the other hand, maybe it will be big enough already.
2011-08-13T18:05:22  <mleise> Then again maybe some people lost interest over time :/
