2010-11-01T00:01:37  <antimatroid> how is the game not zero sum?
2010-11-01T00:01:47  <antimatroid> i'm of the opinion that it very much is
2010-11-01T00:01:51  <TravisD> antimatroid: what happens when you attack a neutral planet?
2010-11-01T00:02:03  <antimatroid> you lose ships or gain a planet
2010-11-01T00:02:21  <TravisD> how is that not zero sum?

2010-11-01T00:02:39  <TravisD> ah
2010-11-01T00:02:50  <antimatroid> attacking a planet it zero sum anyway
2010-11-01T00:02:58  <antimatroid> in a way
2010-11-01T00:03:17  <TravisD> well, not in the long term. A difference of one ship changes who controls it, and then the growth makes it not zero sum
2010-11-01T00:03:43  <antimatroid> how?
2010-11-01T00:04:00  <TravisD> your gains aren't always your opponents losses
2010-11-01T00:04:22  <antimatroid> holding their ships/growth etc. constant and yeah it is
2010-11-01T00:04:35  <TravisD> I could be misunderstanding though
2010-11-01T00:04:40  <antimatroid> so could i :P

2010-11-01T00:05:05  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure it's reasonable to treat the game entirely as zero sum

2010-11-01T00:08:38  <demerzel_> sigh: no i am saying it seems the main advantage of uct over mc is that it remembers 'good' moves and the likelihood of this being useful in a game where moves are unlikely to repeat means it's a small one at best

2010-11-01T00:26:35  <antimatroid> i'm not convinced taking neutrals isn't zero sum
2010-11-01T00:29:17  <McLeopold> antimatroid: it really depends on how you frame the question
2010-11-01T00:30:30  <McLeopold> if you go down 30 ships, it's a plus 30 advantage to your opponent.
2010-11-01T00:30:45  <McLeopold> if you attack him with 30 ships, you both go down 30 and it's even
2010-11-01T00:31:57  <McLeopold> growth rates can complicate it, but I suppose you could say a position is like a good move each turn you hold it
2010-11-01T00:33:36  <bhasker> hah i like my snipe code check out this game and watch the top right 62 ship neutral
2010-11-01T00:33:38  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=801152
2010-11-01T00:35:15  <McLeopold> I wouldn't be too proud of that
2010-11-01T00:35:32  <McLeopold> It changed hands alot, and you sunk 10 into it with no affect.
2010-11-01T00:36:17  <bhasker> the 10 was a coordinated attack
2010-11-01T00:36:21  <bhasker> but since there was a 11 incoming
2010-11-01T00:36:27  <bhasker> it was better to let him burn it
2010-11-01T00:36:30  <bhasker> and then capture
2010-11-01T00:36:40  <bhasker> than capture by sending 22 ships first
2010-11-01T00:36:47  <bhasker> so it aborted the second the launch
2010-11-01T00:37:07  <bhasker> i meant it aborted the second launch*
2010-11-01T00:41:28  <McLeopold> okay, that makes sense
2010-11-01T00:41:57  <McLeopold> antimatroid: if you look at the wikipedia article on zero-sum, look at the extensions section
2010-11-01T00:42:55  <McLeopold> you can reduce a non-zero-sum game to a zero-sum game by representing to global profit/loss
2010-11-01T00:43:20  <McLeopold> so if you only care about having more ships at 200 turns, at that is your eval function, then it can be zero sum
2010-11-01T00:43:35  <McLeopold> If you interesting in evaluating best planets to attack, then it is not
2010-11-01T00:44:45  <McLeopold> I'm looking for critique on those ideas...
2010-11-01T00:46:37  <antimatroid> hmm interesting
2010-11-01T00:46:47  <antimatroid> i have that book in this room, i'll take a look
2010-11-01T00:47:54  <demerzel_> McLeopold:i used zero-sum end game exclusively but you have to have some kind of midgame eval to make sure you will even get the full value
2010-11-01T00:49:03  <demerzel_> haha i love wiki game theory articles
2010-11-01T00:49:04  <demerzel_> For instance in the game of "chicken" if one player has the option of ripping the steering wheel from their car they should always take it because it leads to a "sub game" in which their rational opponent is precluded from doing the same thing (and killing them both).
2010-11-01T00:49:18  <antimatroid> this book, for a first in it's field, has a butload of stuff
2010-11-01T00:50:49  <McLeopold> in a pistol duel between 3, it is rational to purposely miss your target if you shoot first
2010-11-01T00:51:13  <McLeopold> then the other 2 go for each other

2010-11-01T00:53:46  <antimatroid> if you all have 100% chance of hitting and all know that each has that, then you know they purposely missed
2010-11-01T00:53:54  <sigh> what you said made me immediatly think of a common puzzle where the three have different probabilities of making their shot

2010-11-01T01:07:47  <antimatroid> when information sets aren't singletons i think
2010-11-01T01:08:46  <antimatroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_set_(game_theory) i think that's right
2010-11-01T01:09:51  <antimatroid> the way i consider information sets is one consists of a set of nodes for which a player could be at, and they wouldn't know which of the nodes in the information set they are at
2010-11-01T01:10:05  <sigh> yeah, I think it is imperfect too
2010-11-01T01:10:14  <sigh> but saying complete information is more precise
2010-11-01T01:10:27  <antimatroid> but then that would mean all strategic games are imperfect information

2010-11-01T01:32:04  <sigh> minimax is easy to understand as an algorithm... hard to implement (effectivly) for this game
2010-11-01T01:32:26  <bhasker> i think my next trick would be to implement mega1's launching ships ahead of neutral acquistion

2010-11-01T01:33:11  <bhasker> at start
2010-11-01T01:33:19  <bhasker> assuming that he will capture the neutral at X turns
2010-11-01T01:33:19  <sigh> ah, I see
2010-11-01T01:33:25  <bhasker> and add ships from the neutral along the way
2010-11-01T01:33:39  <bhasker> i have the framework to do it but its a little tricky to get it right
2010-11-01T01:33:55  <sigh> is it actually a good idea, or it is simply a side effect of his algorithm?
2010-11-01T01:34:07  <bhasker> well its a good idea at start at least
2010-11-01T01:34:12  <bhasker> not sure after mid game
2010-11-01T01:34:17  <McLeopold> I can do it, and it's a side affect.
2010-11-01T01:34:18  <bhasker> at start you capture planets faster
2010-11-01T01:34:30  <McLeopold> I don't think it would make too much difference.
2010-11-01T01:34:32  <bhasker> hmm how is it a side affect?
2010-11-01T01:34:34  <demerzel_> i have what he has already
2010-11-01T01:34:43  <demerzel_> what is hard is figuring out whether to keep it going as situations change
2010-11-01T01:34:48  <bhasker> well it does matter on games where start planets are far apart
2010-11-01T01:34:59  <bhasker> capturing a planet one turn ahead can mean win/loss
2010-11-01T01:35:18  <demerzel_> ie you have a plan to launch 2/3 of the ships ahead of time
2010-11-01T01:35:24  <demerzel_> but the last 1/3 is needed for defense
2010-11-01T01:35:38  <sigh> but I don't see how sending a partial fleet to a neutral helps?
2010-11-01T01:35:41  <demerzel_> the 2/3 are already in the air - so what do you gain/lose
2010-11-01T01:35:50  <demerzel_> you send ahead of time
2010-11-01T01:35:54  *** fmeyer <fmeyer!~fmeyer@186.220.219.6> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2010-11-01T01:36:01  <demerzel_> knowing you will have ships at a closer planet to help out
2010-11-01T01:36:08  <demerzel_> all arrive same turn
2010-11-01T01:36:34  <bhasker> lets say you will acquire 10 ships 2 turns from now
2010-11-01T01:36:36  <bhasker> and you need 12 to take the neutral
2010-11-01T01:36:39  <bhasker> you launch 2 now
2010-11-01T01:36:45  <bhasker> which travel 2 turns
2010-11-01T01:36:53  <bhasker> and then you add the 10 from the neutral you captured
2010-11-01T01:37:05  <bhasker> so you arrive at your destination with your full fleet 2 turns ahead
2010-11-01T01:37:09  <sigh> oh sure, coordinating attacks from multiple sources, I do that already
2010-11-01T01:37:12  <demerzel_> i did actually implement that - i just have to implement some kind of priority queue
2010-11-01T01:37:18  <bhasker> no its not coordinating
2010-11-01T01:37:21  <bhasker> its more
2010-11-01T01:37:23  <sigh> it's not?
2010-11-01T01:37:28  <bhasker> the neutral is not converted yet
2010-11-01T01:37:31  <bhasker> its still neutral
2010-11-01T01:37:35  <demerzel_> yea this involved queuing orders for a future turn
2010-11-01T01:37:37  <bhasker> when you launched the 2
2010-11-01T01:38:11  <sigh> yeah, I delay orders so that they all arrive on the same turn... or at least they try to
2010-11-01T01:38:21  <McLeopold> if you need to wait for the neutral, you might as well send enough for both
2010-11-01T01:38:26  <demerzel_> one of my few wins
2010-11-01T01:38:30  <bhasker> well you don't hav eenough
2010-11-01T01:38:33  <bhasker> lets say it turn 1
2010-11-01T01:38:37  <demerzel_> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=801072 you can see it
2010-11-01T01:38:38  <bhasker> you sent to capture 3 neutrals
2010-11-01T01:38:42  <bhasker> and there is a 4th
2010-11-01T01:38:54  <bhasker> which you could capture once you have some ships from the neutrals
2010-11-01T01:39:03  <demerzel_> sigh: there's a difference between holding orders and actually launching this turn on faith that you will launch more 2 turns ahead
2010-11-01T01:39:04  <bhasker> you could launch your remaining at the 4th at turn 1
2010-11-01T01:39:14  <bhasker> and add in the ships from the neutrals as they convert
2010-11-01T01:39:25  <bhasker> well not at turn 1
2010-11-01T01:39:28  <bhasker> maybe at turn 3
2010-11-01T01:39:44  <bhasker> yea my bot does the holding part as well
2010-11-01T01:39:51  <bhasker> but it needs to have all the ships for the order
2010-11-01T01:40:02  <demerzel_> in that game i launch at turn 29
2010-11-01T01:40:10  <bhasker> i don't factor into the calculations future ships
2010-11-01T01:40:21  <sigh> ah, future arrivals, got you
2010-11-01T01:40:28  <demerzel_> with the expectation that the neutral i acquire at turn 33 will help out
2010-11-01T01:40:43  <sigh> yeah... mine only takes that into account to a very small extent
2010-11-01T01:40:53  <demerzel_> it's difficult for a variety of reasons
2010-11-01T01:41:03  <sigh> yup
2010-11-01T01:41:08  <demerzel_> and even if you do implement it there's nothing to stop your plan from failing at the end
2010-11-01T01:41:11  <bhasker> yea well mega1's bot does it quite well
2010-11-01T01:41:13  <bhasker> true
2010-11-01T01:41:20  <bhasker> so its good at start on split maps
2010-11-01T01:41:26  <bhasker> where start positions are far apart
2010-11-01T01:41:34  <bhasker> can allow you to acquire a couple of neutrals faster
2010-11-01T01:41:46  <demerzel_> yea my bot is seriously gimped atm i only allow it one target per turn but that's where it wins if it does win
2010-11-01T01:42:27  <sigh> only one target per turn? o_O
2010-11-01T01:42:36  <demerzel_> it's still very early alpha
2010-11-01T01:42:41  <sigh> fair enough :)
2010-11-01T01:42:43  <demerzel_> i mean it's only been working < 24 hours
2010-11-01T01:42:53  <sigh> ah, i see
2010-11-01T01:42:55  <demerzel_> and i just tracked down the last bug i know about like 4 hours ago lol
2010-11-01T01:43:44  <demerzel_> this is the only game i'm semi-proud of so far: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=800923
2010-11-01T01:45:32  <demerzel_> the rest are pretty horrible defeats because of my target limitation, bugs, and lack of defense lol
2010-11-01T01:45:54  <sigh> that's not bad for such a new bot
2010-11-01T01:46:00  <bhasker> its interesting to watch the bot
2010-11-01T01:46:23  <bhasker> my bot is rather boring to watch
2010-11-01T01:46:25  <bhasker> :(
2010-11-01T01:46:27  <demerzel_> it just makes me all warm and fuzzy to see 5 coordinated launches land
2010-11-01T01:46:41  <bhasker> it just piles up ships and steam rolls
2010-11-01T01:46:42  <sigh> demerzel_: yeah, I know what you mean :)
2010-11-01T01:48:15  <demerzel_> i think it's got potential but putting in more than 1 move is going to be ap ain
2010-11-01T01:48:19  <demerzel_> or rather the branch part

2010-11-01T01:48:33  <sigh> branch part?
2010-11-01T01:48:38  <demerzel_> because it will change every turn due to circumstances + figuring out which move to prune and if i've invested in them etc
2010-11-01T01:49:04  <demerzel_> yea i'm going to set up a tree
2010-11-01T01:49:14  <demerzel_> the moves it makes are completely isolated plans already
2010-11-01T01:49:31  <demerzel_> gotta set up some kind of simworld to run them in and see results of movex -> movey etc
2010-11-01T01:49:37  <sigh> i see... sounds similar to what I'm trying
2010-11-01T01:49:56  <demerzel_> i had that in my old C# bot but it was isolated to 1 source -> 1 target

2010-11-01T02:13:20  <raedwulf> anyways i think i need to get my bot running today
2010-11-01T02:16:07  <demerzel_> good luck!
2010-11-01T02:16:18  <demerzel_> i got mine running but found about 8 hours worth of bugs lol
2010-11-01T02:16:23  <demerzel_> was hoping to be a bit further
2010-11-01T02:16:31  <raedwulf> i've been testing bits and pieces as i go along
2010-11-01T02:16:34  <demerzel_> at least that's over with
2010-11-01T02:16:55  <demerzel_> well me too but certain little things = big problems lol
2010-11-01T02:17:10  <raedwulf> but the main search routine is completely untested and its parameters are random values which i probably need to tweak or "train"
2010-11-01T02:17:15  <demerzel_> i do have a nice setup now where i can recreate the last tcp game i played over and over and figure out what i was thinking at least
2010-11-01T02:17:27  <raedwulf> yea i have that too
2010-11-01T02:17:43  <raedwulf> basically - i can take a text file with the moves
2010-11-01T02:17:48  <raedwulf> and use that for stdin
2010-11-01T02:17:50  <raedwulf> lol

2010-11-01T03:13:05  <antimatroid> wouldn't it be better for mega1 to not send those fleets first move?

2010-11-01T03:13:17  <antimatroid> wait and see if it's still best to take those neutrals
2010-11-01T03:13:23  <demerzel_> what game?
2010-11-01T03:13:37  <antimatroid> you were talking about him sending out fleets first move to neutrals he intends to take later
2010-11-01T03:13:47  <antimatroid> i do something like that, but i coordinate attacks
2010-11-01T03:14:13  <antimatroid> so it wont send fleets from a planet until it's expected to reach the destination at the final time of the overall move
2010-11-01T03:14:24  <antimatroid> i should change that for offense
2010-11-01T03:15:18  <antimatroid> that also gives you an information advantage, in that the other bot can't entirely see what you're planning to do
2010-11-01T03:15:22  <demerzel_> well in a pure cost-benefit analysis accounting for enemy possibility you would naturally favor closer
2010-11-01T03:15:42  <antimatroid> but it wouldn't change the time in which you acquire the neutral
2010-11-01T03:15:46  <demerzel_> on turn 1 that is
2010-11-01T03:15:52  <demerzel_> yes that's true
2010-11-01T03:16:02  <demerzel_> but why would you pick it as a target if you're factoring in enemy poss
2010-11-01T03:16:16  <antimatroid> you might, but you don't know exactly what they're going to do
2010-11-01T03:16:25  <antimatroid> those ships might be used somewhere better on the next turn
2010-11-01T03:16:36  <antimatroid> if you don't already commit them you can make that move, if they're still optimal, send them then
2010-11-01T03:16:53  <demerzel_> yes but if they weren't used somewhere you lost a turn's advantage
2010-11-01T03:17:12  <demerzel_> woop my shitbot won against JamesMG(fun haha)
2010-11-01T03:17:13  <antimatroid> no you didn't, cause you weren't planning to acquire the planet with that fleet
2010-11-01T03:17:26  <antimatroid> only if the planet is in direct line extending one of the other neutrals you took
2010-11-01T03:17:31  <demerzel_> it still has no concept of overcommitting
2010-11-01T03:18:54  <antimatroid> mega1: if you can be bothered, ^^, yay or nay?
2010-11-01T03:19:17  <mega1> antimatroid: what is the question exactly?
2010-11-01T03:19:34  <antimatroid> people say you send fleets to neutrals on the first turn without intending to take it with that move
2010-11-01T03:19:42  <antimatroid> i think it's better to wait and send those fleets the next turn
2010-11-01T03:19:45  <demerzel_> i'm sure he intends to take it
2010-11-01T03:19:52  <antimatroid> or, for them to arrive when you plan to take it
2010-11-01T03:19:53  <demerzel_> he just might need to cancel that plan before completion
2010-11-01T03:20:06  <mega1> I think my bot sends fleets at the latest possible time.
2010-11-01T03:20:23  <antimatroid> i'm going strictly off the convo in here, nevermind ;)
2010-11-01T03:20:25  <mega1> so if one is sent on the first turn then it's needed
2010-11-01T03:20:41  <mega1> (or is a staging order)
2010-11-01T03:20:50  <mega1> (which is unlikely on the first turn)
2010-11-01T03:20:52  <demerzel_> i am not even going to touch staging for a while
2010-11-01T03:21:01  <antimatroid> staging order?
2010-11-01T03:21:10  <demerzel_> there is something wrong with my defense i can't quite figure out what it is but i can see it
2010-11-01T03:21:33  <mega1> antimatroid: an order to send ships to the 'front line'
2010-11-01T03:21:55  <antimatroid> hmmm, yeah i could see my bot doing that
2010-11-01T03:22:17  <antimatroid> i tried doing a bot the other night that had each player pick moves and implement it against the state from the moves the other player just made
2010-11-01T03:22:32  <antimatroid> but then if i had their bot "expand", my bot would try to offend against that
2010-11-01T03:22:42  <antimatroid> hence my bot started trying to attack neutrals closest to them stupidly
2010-11-01T03:23:32  <mega1> you should ask the opponent what he's going to play
2010-11-01T03:23:59  <antimatroid> i just treat it like it's my bot and pick moves

2010-11-01T09:17:10  <Migi32> it will say "invalid move" when it was a genuine win for you, but there will be more games.

2010-11-01T09:20:54  <Migi32> if I'm behind 10 growth and in ship numbers I don't even think there's a 0.01% chance of coming back
2010-11-01T09:21:28  <bhasker> hmm probably not, unless you manage to steal the planet in next couple  of turns
2010-11-01T09:21:37  <bhasker> actually 10 growth can be made up
2010-11-01T09:21:40  <bhasker> if you steal a 5
2010-11-01T09:21:41  <bhasker> you are even
2010-11-01T09:22:00  <bhasker> i would say >10 is harder
2010-11-01T09:22:11  <bhasker> though as long as you have more ships you can always win
2010-11-01T09:23:14  <Migi32> hmm, I changed my mind. Surrendering will show up as "invalid move", so it will mask if there is a genuine invalid move sent...
2010-11-01T09:23:21  <Migi32> (even though that should never happen)
2010-11-01T09:23:32  <bhasker> if you really want to surrender just launch all your ships
2010-11-01T09:23:35  <bhasker> at some enemy targets
2010-11-01T09:23:48  <bhasker> most probably any good bot will just wipe you out
2010-11-01T09:24:14  <Migi32> ah yes, or send to every neutral exactly how many ships that neutral has

2010-11-01T09:30:40  <Migi32> yeah, and people are planning minimax tree searches. For 2 turns deep that's 10000000^2 possibilities. For 5 it's unimaginable
2010-11-01T09:32:03  <bhasker> why would you need to evaluate every possibility
2010-11-01T09:32:14  <Frontier> If you could just go with approximations... but most of the time in planet wars you have to deal with exact numbers of ships.
2010-11-01T09:32:23  <bhasker> can't you like heuristically eliminate most of the launches
2010-11-01T09:32:39  <Migi32> that's harder than it sounds, I think
2010-11-01T09:32:57  <Frontier> bhasker: Because, it is cool. No honestly, because you might find a combination that leaves your attack source planets in a good constellation for the next set of attacks
2010-11-01T09:33:19  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-01T09:33:54  <Frontier> In effect every single ship can make a difference many times later, I believe. Like a butterfly effect.
2010-11-01T09:34:34  <Frontier> That's quite academic though, as the enemy's decision bring much more unexpected behaviour into the graph.

2010-11-01T11:50:22  * janzert wonders why adblock is getting a false positive on our rankings page
2010-11-01T11:50:32  <eburnette> If there are 400 an hour and each one takes 500K to store (both very conservative estimates) that would be under 5GB per day, so a 1TB drive could store 200 days worth.
2010-11-01T11:51:28  <demerzel_> janzert: i'm not sure but if i use firebug to wipe out the 'class="leaderboard"' it displays fine
2010-11-01T11:51:48  <janzert> heh, wierd
2010-11-01T11:51:52  <demerzel_> eburnette: there are 400 games per hour maybe but only so many that are within the top 100, it was 8000 last time
2010-11-01T11:52:15  <demerzel_> janzert: could change the class to tblRanking or something else
2010-11-01T11:52:56  <demerzel_> eburnette: still with 8000 games i have something like 5.2 million fleet states lol
2010-11-01T11:53:08  <eburnette> I'd just like links to games to last more than a few hours
2010-11-01T11:53:12  <demerzel_> the only really useful data i got out of it was all the maps are now in my db
2010-11-01T11:53:44  <demerzel_> even tho i have yet to use it except to provide mega1 with a list of all the starting planet distances by mapid
2010-11-01T11:53:49  <demerzel_> looking back that may not have been smart
2010-11-01T11:54:37  <lavalamp_> demerzel: lol
2010-11-01T11:54:39  <eburnette> Fleet states are from, to, owner, length, remaining. 5 integers, maybe 15 bytes in ascii.
2010-11-01T11:55:34  <eburnette> under 100MB
2010-11-01T11:55:39  <demerzel_> oh yea it's not huge
2010-11-01T11:56:01  <demerzel_> i actually started out thinking i'd just do like i do with my fleets only once but it was too much of a pain
2010-11-01T11:56:04  <demerzel_> it's under half a gig
2010-11-01T11:56:27  <demerzel_> janzert: this is the thing that kills the "leaderboard" -- ~courier-journal.com,~sporza.be,~southparkstudios.com,~mpora.com,~metalsucks.net,~mygamercard.net,~trueachievements.com##.leaderboard
2010-11-01T11:56:41  <demerzel_> idk why it triggers on there honestly
2010-11-01T11:58:26  <demerzel_> i guess the address don't matter - anyway i'll post it up on the forums it's pretty easy to fix
2010-11-01T11:58:47  <eburnette> So whether it's 0.5GB or 5GB per day, isn't there room for a few more days of history to get more persistent game links?

2010-11-01T12:00:53  <demerzel_> that's not per day tho
2010-11-01T12:01:00  <demerzel_> oh you mean tcp scrape
2010-11-01T12:01:11  <demerzel_> i don't even try to do that his keep window is so short it's ridiculous
2010-11-01T12:01:15  <eburnette> er, bhasker posted that one
2010-11-01T12:01:32  <demerzel_> i scraped the ai-contest games
2010-11-01T12:01:42  <demerzel_> 8000 is the number of top 100 vs top 100 over all time
2010-11-01T12:01:54  <demerzel_> or was a week ago, probably lower due to all the resubmits
2010-11-01T12:02:30  <demerzel_> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=1049
2010-11-01T12:02:31  <eburnette> The ai-contest games are persistent. For example http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=6282482 is still there
2010-11-01T12:02:39  <demerzel_> yea that's why i chose to scrape it
2010-11-01T12:04:11  <demerzel_> guess i'll figure out why i do nothing on turn 1
2010-11-01T12:04:16  <demerzel_> altho it has worked out a few times lol
2010-11-01T12:06:25  <eburnette> ai-contest seems to keep at least 1 million games, http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=5000000 and http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=6000000 still exist

2010-11-01T12:11:43  <janzert> ai-contest has all the games since the contest started, the format on how they are stored in the database changed early in the contest and I'm not sure games before that were converted to the new format but they are still there in the old format for sure
2010-11-01T12:12:41  <lavalamp_> mine is trying to send more ships from a planet than are stationed there during the evaluation function :(
2010-11-01T12:12:56  <janzert> there are currently 2295362 games in the database in the current format
2010-11-01T12:13:08  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4387), dmj111(4298), shangas(4224), Hazard(4193), FlameN(4164), Accoun(4154), joakim_mjardner(4152), felixcoto(4146), george(4111), Slin-.-(4096)
2010-11-01T12:13:32  <eburnette> And how big is the database in terms of disk space
2010-11-01T12:13:37  <demerzel_> lavalamp_: that sucks, i've definitely got an overcompensation on defense and there's something wrong with it in general but i can't find a concrete problem
2010-11-01T12:15:01  <demerzel_> it's just off - i had perfect defense on my C# bot lol - at least my c++ is picking up a few wins now makes me feel better
2010-11-01T12:15:07  <janzert> the table containing the game playback information alone is just over 20GB
2010-11-01T12:15:29  <demerzel_> you probably don't store fleet info directly ie you only have launch turn
2010-11-01T12:15:32  <janzert> and it is being stored compressed
2010-11-01T12:15:35  <demerzel_> i was going to do that but too much effort to make the functions
2010-11-01T12:18:05  <janzert> total size of the contest database on disk is 26GB

2010-11-01T12:40:26  <mega1> then played it too aggressive
2010-11-01T12:40:36  <demerzel_> it has no consideration for leaving itself open yet ;)
2010-11-01T12:41:28  <demerzel_> the only reins it has atm is 'don't take a neutral unless you can't take an enemy' and also 'only if you are going to lose without it'

2010-11-01T12:45:33  <antimatroid> morning :)
2010-11-01T12:46:33  <raedwulf> afternoon
2010-11-01T12:52:28  <davidjliu> hello
2010-11-01T12:52:36  <raedwulf> hi
2010-11-01T12:53:30  <mega1> demerzel_: the 'only if you are going to lose without it' bit sounds hard
2010-11-01T12:54:04  <demerzel_> it's not perfect
2010-11-01T12:54:11  <demerzel_> it's temporary anyway until i get a tree going
2010-11-01T12:54:28  <demerzel_> it was just spending all its fleets taking neutrals and losing horribly when it was ahead
2010-11-01T12:56:33  <lavalamp_> that's what mine does atm
2010-11-01T12:58:21  <demerzel_> if you can't take an enemy juts compare turn 200 score totals and if you're going to lose then tell it to go ahead
2010-11-01T12:58:25  <demerzel_> that's my temporary stopgap
2010-11-01T12:58:43  <demerzel_> works pretty well
2010-11-01T12:58:55  <antimatroid> i only have mine expand if i don't have final growth over like 1.7*theirs
2010-11-01T12:58:58  <antimatroid> excluding first turn
2010-11-01T12:59:13  <demerzel_> first turn your scores are even
2010-11-01T12:59:15  <demerzel_> <=
2010-11-01T12:59:28  <antimatroid> not when i'm updating info for each "move" i make :P
2010-11-01T12:59:45  <demerzel_> yea same it's flawed for sure
2010-11-01T12:59:48  <demerzel_> but better than nothing
2010-11-01T13:00:06  <antimatroid> one option is to make that decision about expanding at the start of the move
2010-11-01T13:00:09  <antimatroid> rather than as you go

2010-11-01T13:01:51  <antimatroid> i don't understand why, my bot refuses to send redistribution moves if i tell it to send all unused ships, but if i do 0.99* it's fine, but then it always sends 1 less than the amount of growth
2010-11-01T13:02:04  <demerzel_> yea i would do that except i don't intend for the heuristics to stay and it doubles as a stupid move check until i get that set in because it can only pick one neutral per turn
2010-11-01T13:02:35  <antimatroid> some heuristics will always have to remain

2010-11-01T13:04:55  <demerzel_> but that's what i intend to fix
2010-11-01T13:05:20  <demerzel_> nah i don't really understand the 0.99999/mymom*thehouse eval functions honestly

2010-11-01T13:52:38  <raedwulf> constraints
2010-11-01T13:53:06  <raedwulf> of which, i've not quite figured out yet
2010-11-01T13:53:32  <lavalamp_> I cancel conflicting orders
2010-11-01T13:53:40  <raedwulf> but i think my method is way too conservative
2010-11-01T13:53:51  <raedwulf> i think my bot might end up cowering at home
2010-11-01T13:53:53  <raedwulf> scared to leave
2010-11-01T13:54:29  <antimatroid> yeah, i considered trying to make it so that my bot NEVER lost a planet, but i think it'd get crippled too easily
2010-11-01T13:54:59  <lavalamp_> my bot thinks it's Marco friggin Polo
2010-11-01T13:55:06  <davidd> if one of yuour planets is attacked you could consider attacking the sources of those attacks
2010-11-01T13:55:26  <davidd> if you can gain 2 planets instead of saving 1
2010-11-01T13:55:41  <antimatroid> i do defense above anything else atm
2010-11-01T13:55:54  <antimatroid> eliminates a whole aspect of moves to consider in my trees
2010-11-01T13:55:57  <JamesMG> same here, I'm starting to think it's crippling my offense in some cases
2010-11-01T13:55:59  <raedwulf> davidd: yea, thats what i was figuring
2010-11-01T13:56:07  <antimatroid> same with redistribution, i just tack that on at the end
2010-11-01T13:56:09  <demerzel__> yup i made defense automatic and perfect
2010-11-01T13:56:18  <demerzel__> you're right tho it does cause problems on offense
2010-11-01T13:56:31  <davidd> yep, sending troops to the front is my last step too
2010-11-01T13:56:39  <antimatroid> yep, another thing i do is never send out ships from a planet of mine that is to be taken or whatever
2010-11-01T13:56:44  <antimatroid> which is very sub optimal in places
2010-11-01T13:56:48  <lavalamp_> yeah, defense & offense are the same value, what matters is how important the planets that you end up with are
2010-11-01T13:56:52  <antimatroid> but if i remove that, it sends ships out just before being taken
2010-11-01T13:57:10  <JamesMG> yeah, I let them last stand on defense, which is pretty dumb in many cases
2010-11-01T13:57:22  <lavalamp_> antimatroid: mine currently wastes ships like that by sending them to a neutral right before it loses a planet
2010-11-01T13:57:27  <davidd> i use some suboptimal strategies for my testing
2010-11-01T13:57:35  <demerzel__> tbf tho it's a rare case where the time you spend defending could be better used somewhere else
2010-11-01T13:57:38  <antimatroid> my bot sucks atm anyway
2010-11-01T13:57:40  <demerzel__> for 1 it's cheap and a guaranteed value
2010-11-01T13:57:43  <antimatroid> i want back in the top 10 :(
2010-11-01T13:57:45  <davidd> i have an optimal bot as opponent
2010-11-01T13:57:57  <davidd> and i build my new features in the suboptimal bot
2010-11-01T13:58:05  <davidd> see if it can overcome the difference
2010-11-01T13:58:34  <davidd> than after developing a feature i add that to the optimal bot
2010-11-01T13:58:37  <antimatroid> even simple sitations are so damn complicated, it's so hard to get everything right
2010-11-01T13:59:05  <davidd> the distance between " do what i want" and writing the if then constraints to make it so
2010-11-01T14:07:30  <demerzel__> that's why defense is automatic - the situation where it being optional is an advantage are so rare and everythign else is already compartmentalized
2010-11-01T14:10:11  <lavalamp_> demerzel__, I dunno. when I made attack an equal priority with defense in my bot it was worth 100-150 Elo on the TCP server
2010-11-01T14:10:33  <demerzel__> well you have to have a damn good eval then
2010-11-01T14:10:59  <lavalamp_> no actually it sucks hardcore
2010-11-01T14:11:28  <lavalamp_> It does prioritize planets by growthrate and distance
2010-11-01T14:11:30  <antimatroid> JamesMG: I thought you had me for a minute

2010-11-01T14:16:22  <JamesMG> probably woulda won again if it hadn't done that, yours seems better mid-conflict than mine

2010-11-01T15:13:57  <JamesMG> I think your bot just beat mine demerzel__
2010-11-01T15:14:12  <JamesMG> yup
2010-11-01T15:14:20  <demerzel__> sweet
2010-11-01T15:14:41  <demerzel__> i got no dist and no concept of leaving myself open and use a 1-ply pure score method
2010-11-01T15:14:46  <demerzel__> digest from that what you can ;)
2010-11-01T15:15:56  <JamesMG> I have a bot like that too, just not the one you just beat
2010-11-01T15:16:19  <JamesMG> although it is less developed than yours for sure
2010-11-01T15:17:00  <demerzel__> mine has only been working about a day and a half

2010-11-01T15:18:31  <demerzel__> it has almost zero of the actual logic i want ti to use but been working out all the state bugs
2010-11-01T15:20:04  <JamesMG> I'm starting to think that if I port my bot to something not C#, and combine the lessons learned from all 3 approaches I've tried
2010-11-01T15:20:08  <JamesMG> I'd have something decent
2010-11-01T15:20:14  <demerzel__> i'm not sure why you let me keep 20
2010-11-01T15:20:21  <amstan> anybody want to do me a favour?
2010-11-01T15:20:32  <demerzel__> yea a fresh recode was a good thing in my case
2010-11-01T15:20:35  <JamesMG> link me to that cool visualizer with the planet IDs again demerzel__?

2010-11-01T15:21:32  <amstan> i guess i could do them myself..
2010-11-01T15:21:36  <demerzel__> that's like 30 seconds
2010-11-01T15:22:02  <demerzel__> JamesMG: you should have stomped me out of 20 - 6 was farther than 19
2010-11-01T15:22:09  <JamesMG> maybe I'll try golang to support lavalamp_

2010-11-01T15:23:24  <demerzel__> why didn't you if you don't mind me asking
2010-11-01T15:23:31  <demerzel__> you went for 0 instead
2010-11-01T15:23:33  <JamesMG> because I just coded a bug in
2010-11-01T15:24:00  <demerzel__> oh nice
2010-11-01T15:24:15  <JamesMG> notice it sent way more ships to 21 than it needed to also?
2010-11-01T15:24:49  <demerzel__> ah no i know why

2010-11-01T15:25:06  <demerzel__> you launched before i actually took it - do you consider non-neutral future enemies?
2010-11-01T15:25:12  <demerzel__> by the time i took it you couldn't have taken it
2010-11-01T15:25:32  <demerzel__> i guess that's a defense failure haha
2010-11-01T15:25:53  <demerzel__> couldn't defend it but didn't consider it as a target until i took it
2010-11-01T15:26:08  <JamesMG> I was tweaking my defense code just now to try and fix another issue, but my change was obviously ill-considered ;)
2010-11-01T15:26:57  <demerzel__> i am pretty proud of my defense in that game - not bad considering it was very bugged 5 games ago
2010-11-01T15:27:21  <JamesMG> wow, the more I look at it, the more I realize how much I just broke
2010-11-01T15:28:02  <JamesMG> on turn 19 for some reason it's treating planet 0 as if it's mine
2010-11-01T15:28:29  <demerzel__> oh weird
2010-11-01T15:28:37  <demerzel__> i was wondering why you went there
2010-11-01T15:28:59  <JamesMG> it's treating it like a frontline planet, so it's shuffling ships there...
2010-11-01T15:30:19  <lavalamp_> My first bot had a bug where if it didn't know what to do it routed everything to planet 0
2010-11-01T15:30:27  <demerzel__> haha
2010-11-01T15:30:43  <lavalamp_> fortunately the only time that happened was when the enemy no longer had any planets
2010-11-01T15:30:50  <demerzel__> ah well that's ok then
2010-11-01T15:30:56  <demerzel__> i actually coded that into my dist code
2010-11-01T15:30:57  <JamesMG> that's better than crashing when there are no enemy planets
2010-11-01T15:31:05  <demerzel__> yup that's why i did it
2010-11-01T15:31:14  <lavalamp_> yes but it was funny when it was winning to see it send everything to the middle ^^
2010-11-01T15:31:25  <JamesMG> mine just stops issuing orders when it sees the enemy won't survive the fleets in the air
2010-11-01T15:33:12  <demerzel__> welp i guess i gotta code the hard stuff now

2010-11-01T15:48:02  <raedwulf> i plan in my head

2010-11-01T15:49:39  <raedwulf> imo, plans are only really really necessary when you have a team of people who work on completely different wavelengths and you need to cook something up that works together
2010-11-01T15:50:01  <raedwulf> i.e. all those funky modelling techniques
2010-11-01T15:52:23  <demerzel__> i think it's more assuming you know the best way to implement it now
2010-11-01T15:52:37  <demerzel__> which assumes you have perfect understanding of the language and the problem

2010-11-01T16:02:20  <demerzel__> well that's usage of the platform that's fine
2010-11-01T16:02:36  <demerzel__> i'm talking the devs not givign a crap about the fact that they don't HAVE to use a wrapper for everything
2010-11-01T16:02:43  <demerzel__> in fact sometimes it's even easier not to
2010-11-01T16:02:46  <raedwulf> ah yes
2010-11-01T16:02:49  <raedwulf> KISS you mean
2010-11-01T16:03:06  <demerzel__> maybe it's just because development is more mainstream now
2010-11-01T16:03:16  <raedwulf> well, tbh i prefer the KISS concept
2010-11-01T16:03:30  <raedwulf> the only time i abstract is for good reason, i.e. if i want something to plug into the same interface
2010-11-01T16:04:05  <demerzel__> oh i'm talking about the builtin wrappers
2010-11-01T16:04:10  <demerzel__> ie arrays are bad use vectors
2010-11-01T16:04:12  <raedwulf> builtin?
2010-11-01T16:04:16  <demerzel__> i abstract all the time ;)
2010-11-01T16:04:54  <raedwulf> ah vectors in C++ are special case, C++ easily removes most of the cruft
2010-11-01T16:05:03  <raedwulf> so they aren't much different to arrays in terms of speed
2010-11-01T16:05:10  <demerzel__> no but that's an exception to the rule
2010-11-01T16:05:25  <demerzel__> and the fact that devs push their usage to the point of declaring arrays obsolete is telling
2010-11-01T16:05:55  <raedwulf> im confused which end of the stick we're dicussing about

2010-11-01T16:10:52  <raedwulf> demerzel__: i don't see it often
2010-11-01T16:11:11  <raedwulf> but if i remember correctly, its essentially like a global variable in terms of performance
2010-11-01T16:11:14  <demerzel__> what do people do?  singletons?  that seems prone to problems
2010-11-01T16:11:29  <demerzel__> i tried to just set up a static instance but it didnt' work out lol
2010-11-01T16:11:31  <raedwulf> so you lose the perf of locally defined variables that are on the stack
2010-11-01T16:11:35  <lavalamp_> yeah, demerzel__, that's a wordy way of making a global

2010-11-01T16:12:01  <raedwulf> i would declare it gameState State;
2010-11-01T16:12:09  <demerzel__> i couldn't init it tho
2010-11-01T16:12:12  <demerzel__> it  was having a lot of issue
2010-11-01T16:12:17  <raedwulf> ok
2010-11-01T16:12:34  <raedwulf> my C++ isn't as good as my C
2010-11-01T16:12:37  <demerzel__> but it was a class with static vars before
2010-11-01T16:12:44  <demerzel__> so might just be the way i was using it
2010-11-01T16:13:07  <raedwulf> i'm not confident about whats going on behind the scenes
2010-11-01T16:13:10  <lavalamp_> static vars are annoying because you have to initialize them correctly

2010-11-01T16:13:54  <demerzel__> yea static methods were working great
2010-11-01T16:14:12  <demerzel__> i just realized i'd either have to copy the whole thing and make a new class which was stupid or turn it into an instance

2010-11-01T16:55:00  <raedwulf> thats what i did
2010-11-01T16:58:47  <demerzel__> nice
2010-11-01T16:59:12  <demerzel__> would you say a class variable instantiated in main() is a global?  does it ever go out of scope?
2010-11-01T16:59:42  <demerzel__> ie i create gameState in main and then call it
2010-11-01T16:59:43  <lavalamp_> demerzel__ it's not a global but it won't go out of scope. It is on the stack.
2010-11-01T16:59:58  <demerzel__> so that's a better impl than just declaring it global then?
2010-11-01T17:00:04  <lavalamp_> Well, unless you new it.
2010-11-01T17:00:09  <lavalamp_> No, make it a global.
2010-11-01T17:00:13  <demerzel__> i have never used new in c++ i'm not even sure why i would
2010-11-01T17:00:19  <lavalamp_> lol

2010-11-01T17:00:44  <demerzel__> lavalamp_: why global over main?  if the class is essentially the basis of the entire prog
2010-11-01T17:00:53  <demerzel__> wouldn't it being on teh stack be a good thing?
2010-11-01T17:00:58  <lavalamp_> for one, stack space is not unlimited
2010-11-01T17:01:10  <demerzel__> true but i think i'm eating up something like 65k atm
2010-11-01T17:01:32  <demerzel__> almost all pod arrays
2010-11-01T17:01:36  <lavalamp_> second, if you ever overrun it you don't risk corrupting everything else on the stack (so your bug might be easier to find)
2010-11-01T17:01:47  <demerzel__> hmm
2010-11-01T17:02:04  <demerzel__> i'm condensing my code now and just trying to figure out best practice
2010-11-01T17:02:12  <demerzel__> i've got a couple of very similar structs etc
2010-11-01T17:02:14  <lavalamp_> hm well I guess an underrun would be more dangerous that way, but still
2010-11-01T17:02:33  <demerzel__> how would i overrun a class on the stack by calling its functions tho
2010-11-01T17:02:55  <lavalamp_> anyway, if you're passing pointers to it all over the place it would be more efficient to have a global
2010-11-01T17:03:00  <demerzel__> i mean any more than if it was global
2010-11-01T17:03:18  <demerzel__> yea i'm debating between having a stub object that is handled by static methods w/ pointers or instances of the class
2010-11-01T17:03:27  <lavalamp_> it doesn't raise the risk of a bug, it just changes the consequence of having one.
2010-11-01T17:04:05  <demerzel__> my gut says that having a simple struct to pass to global static methods is the best way
2010-11-01T17:04:13  <lavalamp_> my personal opinion is that designs with stub objects usually have a better alternative
2010-11-01T17:04:15  <demerzel__> but i'm wondering if i'm right since i also like c strings lol
2010-11-01T17:04:47  <lavalamp_> You're basically describing how to do things in C

2010-11-01T17:05:46  <lavalamp_> C++ way is classes :)
2010-11-01T17:05:49  <demerzel__> take gamestate as an example
2010-11-01T17:05:57  <demerzel__> i use classes but i mostly use them as containers for static methods

2010-11-01T17:09:40  <lavalamp_> the how to make the gameState qusetion, that is ^^
2010-11-01T17:09:47  <demerzel__> it's ok i'd probably just ignore you and do it my way anyway but i was interested in your viewpoint

2010-11-01T17:14:15  <JamesMG> I just store them :(
2010-11-01T17:14:44  <demerzel__> well in C# i used a static class with invididual planets
2010-11-01T17:15:05  <demerzel__> then while checking out hypos i would just copy the planet classes and hack them up without touching the original
2010-11-01T17:15:41  <lavalamp_> you could do the same in C++ I think
2010-11-01T17:15:59  <demerzel__> well it was optimized to do it that way tho because i was only looking at 1 source -> 1 dest
2010-11-01T17:16:02  <demerzel__> and only 1 ply
2010-11-01T17:16:18  <demerzel__> when you get into 2+ ply and multi source then you have to look at all impacts

2010-11-01T17:34:12  <Error323> std::numeric_limits<double>::max() / ((numships/growthrate) + log(2^distance)) iirc
2010-11-01T17:34:30  <Error323> which others have you got :P
2010-11-01T17:34:51  <bhasker> ah k
2010-11-01T17:34:59  <bhasker> heh i use a breakeven point metric as well
2010-11-01T17:35:02  <bhasker> simply
2010-11-01T17:35:03  <Error323> i thought it might be a good idea to also factor in the neighbouring planets
2010-11-01T17:35:16  <bhasker> oh i do that as a second step
2010-11-01T17:35:26  <bhasker> the first is just a way to order neutrals in terms of desirability
2010-11-01T17:35:37  <Error323> ugh lost again to you >_>
2010-11-01T17:35:47  <bhasker> and then when i actually decide to process the neutral i check nearby Planets etc
2010-11-01T17:35:53  <bhasker> and decide whether to attack or not
2010-11-01T17:35:56  <bhasker> and how much to attack with
2010-11-01T17:36:14  <bhasker> the value function is just to make sure I try for higher value neutrals before trying for crappy ones
2010-11-01T17:36:23  <Error323> i see
2010-11-01T17:36:28  <bhasker> you won
2010-11-01T17:36:32  <bhasker> the latest one
2010-11-01T17:36:44  <Error323> i don't factor in the map layout at all atm
2010-11-01T17:36:57  <bhasker> and then i exclude bad neutrals if there are neutrals that i can acquire in a turn or two
2010-11-01T17:36:58  <bhasker> etc
2010-11-01T17:37:29  <bhasker> because otherwise you would end up burning 45 ships on a 1 growth when after two turns you could have probably got a 5 growth with 55 ships
2010-11-01T17:37:33  <bhasker> at least my bot used to do that
2010-11-01T17:37:36  <Error323> i pop the best neutral of the priority queue
2010-11-01T17:37:42  <Error323> and wait until i can get it
2010-11-01T17:37:45  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-01T17:37:47  <bhasker> i don't do that
2010-11-01T17:37:52  <bhasker> my bot is aggresive

2010-11-01T18:03:00  <bhasker> yup
2010-11-01T18:03:05  <bhasker> i tried to make it a bit more aggressive
2010-11-01T18:03:10  <bhasker> but its risky
2010-11-01T18:03:14  <bhasker> since then you are trading planets

2010-11-01T18:47:23  <bhasker> a 300+ elo on tcp

2010-11-01T19:06:54  <Migi32> no configurable constants?
2010-11-01T19:07:01  <Error323> mmm?
2010-11-01T19:07:26  <Migi32> why the 2 and not, say, 1.9?
2010-11-01T19:07:43  <Error323> oh
2010-11-01T19:07:48  <Migi32> just a guess or mathematically deduced,

2010-11-01T19:08:59  <demerzel__> seen it before
2010-11-01T19:09:56  <Migi32> no, it was also a random number :P

2010-11-01T19:10:47  <Error323> xD
2010-11-01T19:11:21  <McLeopold> that's a really odd formula
2010-11-01T19:12:19  <Migi32> the units of that formula are ships/turns^3 btw
2010-11-01T19:12:21  <demerzel__> Error323: can you please explain how (growthrate^2 / numships) / distance is any more useful than (growthrate * (turnsremaining - distance))
2010-11-01T19:12:37  <demerzel__> i really don't understand why all these log(n) and exponents
2010-11-01T19:12:45  <demerzel__> is there some kind of attempt at normalization or?
2010-11-01T19:12:55  <Error323> well the growthrate is more important in the long run
2010-11-01T19:13:09  <demerzel__> ahh so you are purposefully weighting it
2010-11-01T19:13:12  <contestbot> Top 10 players: bocsimacko(4367), dmj111(4286), Hazard(4168), FlameN(4162), shangas(4159), joakim_mjardner(4123), george(4089), jambachili(4084), Accoun(4081), felixcoto(4079)
2010-11-01T19:13:14  <Error323> indeed
2010-11-01T19:13:20  <demerzel__> but it's a tiny tiny number
2010-11-01T19:13:29  <demerzel__> or what is numships ?  the number on the planet?
2010-11-01T19:13:40  <Error323> of the neutral planet, yes
2010-11-01T19:13:41  <demerzel__> i have long forgotten the starter pack classes sorry
2010-11-01T19:14:03  <demerzel__> ah so 5 / 5 = 1 / 3 away is .3333
2010-11-01T19:14:14  <Migi32> with that scoring function, it would score a planet with 2 ships twice as high as one with 1 ship. Strange.
2010-11-01T19:14:14  <demerzel__> err 5/3 lol
2010-11-01T19:14:23  <demerzel__> yea i don't get the numships thing
2010-11-01T19:14:25  <Migi32> But I guess it's enough to beat bocsimacko
2010-11-01T19:14:49  <Error323> well just once :P
2010-11-01T19:14:52  <McLeopold> once
2010-11-01T19:14:58  <Error323> out of 99 prolly XD
2010-11-01T19:15:00  <Error323> dunno
2010-11-01T19:15:18  <Migi32> I couldn't beat him given a million tries
2010-11-01T19:15:25  <Migi32> yet :p
2010-11-01T19:15:29  <McLeopold> I've always geared my formulas to look for the lowest number.
2010-11-01T19:15:31  <demerzel__> my shitbot actually had him cornered once
2010-11-01T19:15:41  <demerzel__> of course it jacked it up but i was like holy shit am i going to win
2010-11-01T19:16:01  <Migi32> ah demerzel__ you also use the JBotManager?

2010-11-01T19:16:18  <demerzel__> i write tcp code directly into the bot
2010-11-01T19:16:40  <Migi32> I can't figure out a way to let JBotManager continuously play so I don't have to press "start" every time I want to fight against a new opponent on TCP
2010-11-01T19:16:48  <Migi32> oh, nice
2010-11-01T19:16:54  <Migi32> also a visualiser?
2010-11-01T19:17:03  <demerzel__> nah i just use the js one
2010-11-01T19:17:27  <demerzel__> i have rarely had a bot so stable i want to put it on loop though
2010-11-01T19:17:58  <McLeopold> Migi32: there is a number you can set for match count
2010-11-01T19:18:02  <Migi32> haha at the end there it all turns red, you can almost hear *poof*
2010-11-01T19:18:11  <Error323> woooooooooow
2010-11-01T19:18:20  <demerzel__> yea haha that match was funny
2010-11-01T19:18:25  <McLeopold> reps
2010-11-01T19:18:33  <demerzel__> i kept getting more incredulous and it was looking so strangely good
2010-11-01T19:18:45  <demerzel__> then it screwed up ofc
2010-11-01T19:18:51  <demerzel__> but holy crap 100 turns lol

2010-11-01T19:23:18  <demerzel__> you don't have dist leopold?
2010-11-01T19:23:25  <demerzel__> i have gone back on forth on its necessity
2010-11-01T19:23:49  <superflit> anyone is using a local serve to train?
2010-11-01T19:24:37  <Migi32> McLeopold, what happened to your bot? You used to be on the spot bocsimacko is now.
2010-11-01T19:24:37  <McLeopold> ? dist?
2010-11-01T19:24:57  <McLeopold> I haven't run my latest version on tcp in 2 weeks.
2010-11-01T19:24:58  <demerzel__> distribution to frontline
2010-11-01T19:25:20  <McLeopold> I'm re-writing the entire framework.
2010-11-01T19:25:28  <demerzel__> nice
2010-11-01T19:25:35  <McLeopold> everything is broken
2010-11-01T19:25:41  <demerzel__> my bot on the site is literally over a month old and in a completely different language
2010-11-01T19:25:43  <Migi32> wow. Still in python?
2010-11-01T19:25:51  <McLeopold> I'm only running my official version to make me feel like I'm still in it.
2010-11-01T19:26:08  *** Commandir <Commandir!~joakim@h85-8-40-32.static.se.alltele.net> has left #aichallenge
2010-11-01T19:26:12  <McLeopold> Yeah, all python
2010-11-01T19:26:23  <McLeopold> I want to do javascript, but I don't think I have time.
2010-11-01T19:26:28  <sigh> o_O
2010-11-01T19:26:31  <Migi32> srsly?
2010-11-01T19:26:41  <sigh> does that server even support that?
2010-11-01T19:26:47  <McLeopold> Yeah, it's not a fast language, but it can be pretty cool.
2010-11-01T19:26:52  <McLeopold> NodeJS, yes it does.
2010-11-01T19:27:02  <Migi32> IMO, javascript < java < everything else :P
2010-11-01T19:27:15  <McLeopold> It's closer to lisp, which, btw, is winning.
2010-11-01T19:27:30  <superflit> mega1 is lisp?
2010-11-01T19:27:43  <sigh> superflit: yes
2010-11-01T19:27:45  <McLeopold> http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742
2010-11-01T19:27:48  <Migi32> it's also the only lisp in the top 100
2010-11-01T19:28:07  <superflit> the language fits the problem..
2010-11-01T19:28:11  <Migi32> top 200, for that matter
2010-11-01T19:28:16  <superflit> I did not expect so goodly.
2010-11-01T19:28:22  <sigh> yah, next lisp is 220
2010-11-01T19:28:25  <demerzel__> is that how you pipe stdin/out in js?  node.js?
2010-11-01T19:28:44  <McLeopold> yeah
2010-11-01T19:28:55  <demerzel__> i was wondering
2010-11-01T19:29:02  <McLeopold> there are other javascript interpreters out there
2010-11-01T19:29:08  <demerzel__> was going to do a js bot just to be esoteric originally but then got stuck at that little detail lol
2010-11-01T19:29:29  <McLeopold> like ringojs
2010-11-01T19:29:52  <demerzel__> i like js but the typing might get a little crazy
2010-11-01T19:29:57  <McLeopold> IMO, javascript will be the language of the future.
2010-11-01T19:30:07  <demerzel__> i do love js for the same reason i like c++ - you can program it in 5 different ways and they all work
2010-11-01T19:30:19  <sigh> well, a lot of wrk is going into it, so maybe
2010-11-01T19:30:23  <McLeopold> Take a look at libraries like jQuery or prototype.  They are works of art.
2010-11-01T19:30:34  <demerzel__> i don't really like jQuery but probably a bit biased
2010-11-01T19:30:45  <demerzel__> tired of answering hey how do i - whoa whoa i only know jquery
2010-11-01T19:30:59  <sigh> haha
2010-11-01T19:31:05  <McLeopold> maybe you don't like jquery programmers?
2010-11-01T19:31:34  <demerzel__> when i have to explain the dom and how to call it in javascript to a professional dev it's a little bizarre
2010-11-01T19:31:45  <demerzel__> but i just put a $ and it appears??
2010-11-01T19:31:56  <sigh> :)
2010-11-01T19:32:41  <McLeopold> usually $ = document.getElementById, but there are other shortcuts, and jquery does overload it
2010-11-01T19:32:48  <demerzel__> yea i know
2010-11-01T19:32:57  <demerzel__> i'm not overly fond of their dom-ignoring injection library
2010-11-01T19:33:09  <Migi32> I didn't know JavaScript was so complex
2010-11-01T19:33:10  <McLeopold> okay, forget jquery, look at the prototype lib
2010-11-01T19:33:30  <demerzel__> javascript is a crazy language
2010-11-01T19:33:38  <demerzel__> you can make it do shit when you press a button in like 3 lines
2010-11-01T19:33:43  <demerzel__> or you can make constructors, prototypes, oop
2010-11-01T19:33:50  <McLeopold> Migi32: if you use it correctly, you need to know very little syntax, and you can start to mold it as you need.
2010-11-01T19:34:22  <McLeopold> demerzel__: I haven't potty trained mine yet...
2010-11-01T19:34:45  <sigh> mostly what annoys me about javascript is the really weak typing
2010-11-01T19:34:53  <sigh> other than that, I like it
2010-11-01T19:35:01  <Migi32> McLeopold, I'm just reading up on JS a bit, but... Classes are functions? Can't wrap my head around that...
2010-11-01T19:35:09  <McLeopold> well, that's kinda how languages are, strong typed or weak typed.
2010-11-01T19:35:26  <McLeopold> I like weak-typed languages the best, which is why I like python.
2010-11-01T19:35:47  <sigh> McLeopold: python is stronger than javascript... I don't mind python
2010-11-01T19:36:03  <McLeopold> Migi32: that's an ugly part of javascript you just pretend doesn't exist. :P
2010-11-01T19:36:03  <sigh> python doesn't automatically convert a string to an int or vice-versa
2010-11-01T19:36:37  <McLeopold> I think it does...
2010-11-01T19:36:43  <Migi32> also, javascript is weak-typed but you do have to type the word "var" in front of a variable. While you're at it why not just type the damn "int"?
2010-11-01T19:36:50  <McLeopold> "bla" + 0?
2010-11-01T19:37:11  <sigh> McLeopold: TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
2010-11-01T19:37:34  <McLeopold> Migi32: another weak point of javascript.  The var ensures you don't bleed into the global scope.
2010-11-01T19:37:35  <sigh> I'm more concerned about: "1" + 2
2010-11-01T19:37:46  <McLeopold> It could have been the other way around, but it isn't.
2010-11-01T19:38:01  <sigh> which is a really big gotcha when doing stuff with javascript
2010-11-01T19:38:25  <Migi32> in JS, "a"+1+2 != "a"+(1+2)
2010-11-01T19:38:40  <Migi32> which can cause unexpected things

2010-11-01T20:55:22  <demerzel_> ok i have a stupid c++ question - if i pass a class in  as a reference ie a(const classname& param) - is it possible to call classname functions?   i can access member vars fine but not sure how the hell to call functions
2010-11-01T20:55:52  <Error323> sure
2010-11-01T20:56:00  <TravisD> demerzel_:  the functions need to be const as well, I believe
2010-11-01T20:56:12  <demerzel_> ahhh that might be it!
2010-11-01T20:56:24  <demerzel_> tbh i don't even know what declaring a function const does
2010-11-01T20:56:32  <demerzel_> static?
2010-11-01T20:56:39  <TravisD> its a contract saying that you won't modify the state of the object

2010-11-01T20:57:35  <demerzel_> liike hmm maybe i could just pass a ref since i wno't modify this obj

2010-11-01T20:58:39  <TravisD> whenever you have a class method which doesn't change an object's state you should make it const. That way your const references aren't useless :P
2010-11-01T20:59:41  <Error323> lol
2010-11-01T20:59:55  <demerzel_> change state = alter member vars?
2010-11-01T21:00:00  <Error323> yes
2010-11-01T21:00:01  <demerzel_> if so that just sounds like static method to me
2010-11-01T21:00:13  <Error323> no thats sth completely different
2010-11-01T21:00:15  <demerzel_> or at least the way i use them
2010-11-01T21:00:15  <TravisD> demerzel_:  It might read member variables
2010-11-01T21:00:37  <TravisD> demerzel_:  Like, "getter" functions are good examples of functions which should be const
2010-11-01T21:00:59  <demerzel_> god i cannot digest that page
2010-11-01T21:01:17  <Error323> perhaps its time to take a break ;)
2010-11-01T21:01:33  <demerzel_> i get why people push const but it's so bizarre how many things it can mean
2010-11-01T21:01:39  <demerzel_> back to a pointer for me
2010-11-01T21:01:51  <sigh> that's c++ for you
2010-11-01T21:02:05  <TravisD> janzert:  You there?
2010-11-01T21:02:07  <dmj111> About the rating instability:  I am pretty sure it is because games from old submissions are not used in the rating process.  When GreenTea resubmitted a few days ago,  I went back up because I no longer had a bunch of losses to him.    When 50+ games disappear from the history, things can change a lot.
2010-11-01T21:02:08  <sigh> the const issues come up with pointers as well...
2010-11-01T21:02:15  <janzert> around anyway
2010-11-01T21:02:25  <demerzel_> oh well i just make the contract with myself not to modify it not the compiler haha
2010-11-01T21:02:51  <TravisD> janzert:  Did you have any luck getting Groovy running? :)
2010-11-01T21:03:06  <janzert> yep see annoncement in forums
2010-11-01T21:03:19  <janzert> announcement even
2010-11-01T21:03:23  <sigh> demerzel_: I mean, there's no need to go back to pointers if all you want to do is remove the const
2010-11-01T21:03:28  <TravisD> janzert:  Thanks :) I appreciate the effort on your part
2010-11-01T21:03:36  <janzert> just waiting to see a few successfully running bots before closing the issue
2010-11-01T21:03:46  <janzert> although my test with the starter package worked fine
2010-11-01T21:03:58  <demerzel_> sigh: yea that's true i guess i'll just be happy that i'm using references instead somewhat at least
2010-11-01T21:04:33  <sigh> references lead to less shoot-self-in-foot moments, I think
2010-11-01T21:04:48  <sigh> constness is an orthogonal issue
2010-11-01T21:05:12  <TravisD> Hahaha, janzert: Thanks for the mention in the post ;) I'm not sure whether I should be flattered or feel sheepish :P
2010-11-01T21:06:53  <demerzel_> well ty for the help i guess i'll conquer const another day i need to just finish reorging and got stuck on that crap for like an hour
2010-11-01T21:07:05  <sigh> :)
2010-11-01T21:07:25  <Error323> about the elo on tcp, is there any significance to an elo < 0 vs > 0 ?
2010-11-01T21:07:30  <janzert> :)
2010-11-01T21:07:31  <Error323> or meaning
2010-11-01T21:07:34  <demerzel_> 0 = median iirc
2010-11-01T21:08:02  <sigh> main site has an an offset so that elo isn't negative
2010-11-01T21:08:06  <sigh> i think it is 2000
2010-11-01T21:08:13  <demerzel_> yup
2010-11-01T21:08:16  <demerzel_> everybody's a winner!
2010-11-01T21:08:21  <sigh> :P
2010-11-01T21:09:46  <Error323> bhasker: around?
2010-11-01T21:10:08  <TravisD> Thanks again janzert. You guys are doing a good job of running the competition :)
2010-11-01T21:10:28  <janzert> Thanks, doing what I can anyway

2010-11-01T23:24:34  <antimatroid> my bot didn't do veyr well on tcp
2010-11-01T23:24:37  <antimatroid> refinement time i guess
2010-11-01T23:24:38  <dmj111> its noon somewhere.
2010-11-01T23:24:41  <bhasker> it beat mine:p
2010-11-01T23:24:57  <antimatroid> i want it to beat everyone :)
2010-11-01T23:25:01  <bhasker> ah high aims
2010-11-01T23:25:07  <antimatroid> yep
2010-11-01T23:25:19  <bhasker> mine on official is upto 40

2010-11-01T23:26:05  <antimatroid> mine wasn't running on official so i haven't had it going, hopefully it shouldn't crash anymore when i pout it up next
2010-11-01T23:26:13  <antimatroid> i was sitting around there last time i had it up
2010-11-01T23:26:21  <bhasker> i wonder if python if fast enough to implement minmax
2010-11-01T23:26:26  <bhasker> or should i look at c++
2010-11-01T23:27:03  <antimatroid> i've no idea of the speed of different languages, i would say it should be fine
2010-11-01T23:27:11  <dmj111> i tried minimax over the weekend, using my current heuristics to guide the move selection.  It didn't look promising.
2010-11-01T23:27:22  <antimatroid> i don't get very far at all cause i waste all my time calculating reasonable moves
2010-11-01T23:27:23  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-01T23:27:36  <antimatroid> dmj111: neither, i'm currently doing a zero sum game approach
2010-11-01T23:27:46  <antimatroid> and use decision trees for each player to generate pure strategies
2010-11-01T23:27:51  <antimatroid> i think it sort of seems to work wel
2010-11-01T23:28:13  <antimatroid> atm, i'm only picking my pure strategy that maximises the min row too, i plan to change that
2010-11-01T23:30:23  <dmj111> it will be interesting to see what kind of strategies you are selecting.  I considered having a (N+1) x (N+1) payoff matrix , where each player all-out attacks a single planet, one at a time, and then solving that.  But, that doesn't seem right.
2010-11-01T23:32:38  <antimatroid> nope, i'm using a decision tree, where at each node i'll pick what looks like the best 3-4 moves, then i pick the best x terminal nodes, and the string of moves to get there are my pure strategies, if that makes sense?
2010-11-01T23:33:22  <antimatroid> once i start doing so many things i can't allocate much time to each though
2010-11-01T23:33:23  <sigh> antimatroid: what constitutes a move?
2010-11-01T23:33:35  <sigh> an entire set of orders?
2010-11-01T23:33:43  <antimatroid> single destination, multiple sources (can even even multiple fleets from the same source, just at different times)
2010-11-01T23:33:59  <sigh> yup, i see

2010-11-01T23:34:28  <adu> hi
2010-11-01T23:34:33  <antimatroid> that way the decision tree looks at moves it plans to make in the future from it's past stringed moves too
2010-11-01T23:34:43  <antimatroid> adu: hi :)
2010-11-01T23:34:51  <adu> what's the latest challenge?
2010-11-01T23:34:52  <bhasker> hm k
2010-11-01T23:34:55  <antimatroid> planet wars
2010-11-01T23:35:09  <antimatroid> it's rather tricky
2010-11-01T23:35:30  <demerzel_> bhasker: but java isn't bad either honestly - i'd rather do c++ since it's compiled instead of relying on a vm on a decrepit server ;)
2010-11-01T23:35:39  <bhasker> i detest java
2010-11-01T23:35:42  <dmj111> antimatroid: i think your explanation is fine.  I am just trying to fit it into my preconceived ideas of how to do things.
2010-11-01T23:35:43  <demerzel_> it's not bad
2010-11-01T23:35:53  <bhasker> and from what i am hearin about minmax not sure there is much benefit in implementing one
2010-11-01T23:36:02  <bhasker> and my crappy math background i would probably screw it up
2010-11-01T23:36:11  <demerzel_> i have no math background - it's not too bad
2010-11-01T23:36:13  <antimatroid> i think it could work if set up right, that's really hard though
2010-11-01T23:36:24  <demerzel_> i am almost positive shampoo is minma
2010-11-01T23:36:33  <demerzel_> his playstyle is the ideal of my prev bots
2010-11-01T23:36:35  <dmj111> bhasker: the nice thing about minimax is there is not much math.
2010-11-01T23:36:45  <antimatroid> minimax?
2010-11-01T23:37:02  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-01T23:37:04  <demerzel_> minimize loss, maximize gain
2010-11-01T23:37:17  <demerzel_> pure arithmetic calc
2010-11-01T23:37:19  <bhasker> yea but i really don't want to code in c++ :-\ i do it at wokr
2010-11-01T23:37:25  <bhasker> and i hate compiling every time i make a change
2010-11-01T23:37:36  <antimatroid> mine takes a good 10 seconds to compile now :(
2010-11-01T23:37:37  <bhasker> python is sooo flexibile
2010-11-01T23:37:40  <demerzel_> haha well i use vs even though i don't use VC
2010-11-01T23:37:56  <demerzel_> i can't wrap my head around the fact that your internal dilemna is python and C++ tho
2010-11-01T23:37:58  <antimatroid> and testing takes forever
2010-11-01T23:38:07  <bhasker> <---lazy programmer
2010-11-01T23:38:12  <bhasker> implementing it in python will be much faster
2010-11-01T23:38:15  <antimatroid> <--- not a proper programmer :)
2010-11-01T23:38:17  <bhasker> but the speed would suck
2010-11-01T23:38:22  <demerzel_> antimatroid: true!  i am refactoring all my code for the 10th time
2010-11-01T23:38:28  <antimatroid> i actually have fun doing stupidly tedious things still
2010-11-01T23:38:33  <demerzel_> haha me too
2010-11-01T23:38:42  <demerzel_> bhasker: it depends on how deep you want to go
2010-11-01T23:38:43  <dmj111> antimatroid: sorry, i meant this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves , even though the moves are simultaneous.
2010-11-01T23:38:43  <bhasker> and i still can't get my stupid planet selection criteria to work correctly
2010-11-01T23:38:50  <bhasker> example
2010-11-01T23:38:51  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=815097
2010-11-01T23:39:01  <bhasker> stupid bot never went for the planet with 8 ships
2010-11-01T23:39:06  <bhasker> and goes for the 83 ship one instead
2010-11-01T23:39:24  <demerzel_> wait you have that bot already?  in what lang
2010-11-01T23:39:31  <antimatroid> dmj111: yeah, i have minimax implemented for a game tree (not with alpha beta pruning, yet) but it doesn't seem to work well either
2010-11-01T23:39:45  * adu doesn't like java either
2010-11-01T23:39:47  <antimatroid> i have minimax written for simultaneous games too, but i'm not sure about just playing pure strategy nash equilibria
2010-11-01T23:39:53  <bhasker> dmj was that a question for me?
2010-11-01T23:39:59  <antimatroid> me has an irrational hate of java, but i refuse to touch it
2010-11-01T23:40:03  <demerzel_> i think minimax has to be used with simultaneous prediction
2010-11-01T23:40:12  <demerzel_> which i have yet to implement
2010-11-01T23:40:24  <antimatroid> simultaneous prediction?
2010-11-01T23:40:38  <antimatroid> yes you will need to model choices from the other bot, any ideas with game theory will need that
2010-11-01T23:41:01  <antimatroid> my gamestate is set up that i can just pass in a player parameter and it'll take that as the person it's making decisions for
2010-11-01T23:41:08  <demerzel_> yes but using minimax for the prediction is the problem haha
2010-11-01T23:41:30  <demerzel_> i am going more for maximize gain minimize potential gain - minimize loss is just autopilot defenses
2010-11-01T23:41:36  <antimatroid> i have functions to pick out individual moves
2010-11-01T23:41:50  <antimatroid> they're really inefficient atm though

2010-11-01T23:42:48  <antimatroid> it needs to be indexible by player number
2010-11-01T23:43:53  <antimatroid> dmj111: for the record, i'm under the thought that mega1 is trying the simultaneous game rather than extensive
2010-11-01T23:44:53  <antimatroid> i also have a play game function that i run befor evaluation nodes in my payoff matrix, where each player makes defense and offense moves each turn before incrementing the state
2010-11-01T23:44:57  <dmj111> It will be interesting to see what he was doing when this is over.
2010-11-01T23:45:03  <antimatroid> it will
2010-11-01T23:45:07  <antimatroid> and what he will do next :P
