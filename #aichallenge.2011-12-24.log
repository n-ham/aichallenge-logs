2011-12-24T00:48:26  <thestinger> unless the game rules are changed up a bit
2011-12-24T00:48:47  <Kettling> Well I guess the prize is about the same as the original comp?

2011-12-24T00:53:58  <FranPeruzzi> so, is it decided what next year's contest will be yet?
2011-12-24T00:55:49  <thestinger> there are a bunch of great ideas on the forums
2011-12-24T00:57:30  <FranPeruzzi> I thought tron was awesome, and right now I'm thinking ants will be a hard act to follow. I hope the contest can keep the same inclusiveness it has always had, even if there has to be some kind of immediate starterbot cutoff like what has been suggested in the forums.
2011-12-24T00:57:55  <thestinger> http://forums.aichallenge.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2184 this is kinda like tron
2011-12-24T00:58:54  <FranPeruzzi> I thought so too.
2011-12-24T01:00:05  <FranPeruzzi> I've been wracking my brain for things that are complex enough to give challenge at the top of the lists, while being easy enough to maintain a low barrier to entry at the bottom.
2011-12-24T01:00:54  <FranPeruzzi> (where I'll probably be)
2011-12-24T01:02:54  <FranPeruzzi> something with simultaneous turns would be nice. It keeps the possible random element of a mixed strategy in place.
2011-12-24T01:04:06  <Extrarius> I like the idea of a strategy game (real-time or turn based, gridded or continuous) with unit options randomly generated at the start of each game
2011-12-24T01:04:25  <Kettling> Re: "next year's comp", I'd like something with economics in it... in honour of the banking undustry
2011-12-24T01:05:37  <Extrarius> Kettling: hrmm, so like monopoly meets wall street, your bot has to decide where to build houses, when it's worth it to forclose instead of restructure, etc? =-P
2011-12-24T01:05:43  <Kettling> Errr I meant industry, although the typo might have been divinely influenced
2011-12-24T01:06:01  <FranPeruzzi> I can't even understand lemonade stand vs weather economics

2011-12-24T01:07:20  <FranPeruzzi> some kind of economy might be interesting.
2011-12-24T01:08:07  <FranPeruzzi> makes me wonder how the game engine would work though, and if open sourcing it would make the game moot.
2011-12-24T01:08:39  <Extrarius> I'd almost like to see a slight modification of ants for the next competition - call it 'bees' and instead of hills, you have queen bees you move around that workers spawn at, and you have to fly food to the queen to make a new worker
2011-12-24T01:09:18  <FranPeruzzi> I loved ants, but I think a modification of ants would allow people to take too much advantage of the knowledge that has been put out there by this year's leaders.

2011-12-24T01:11:20  <thestinger> I think a risk/diplomacy style game would be awesome
2011-12-24T01:11:38  <Extrarius> FranPeruzzi: It would raise the bar for entry, but personally I'd love to see another iteration of ants with people taking advantage of what everybody published. Changing a few rules slightly would make room for more innovation (ie movable hills, transporting food, maybe a few other things), and it'd be neat to see what comes next
2011-12-24T01:11:44  <FranPeruzzi> while reading post-mortems, one of the things that stood out was the fact that my understanding of the problem and associated strategies just was not as clear as that of the leaders. I think that having something similar to ant would take the advantage away from those who are able to think more strategically
2011-12-24T01:12:00  <FranPeruzzi> I would love something like Risk
2011-12-24T01:12:19  <Extrarius> also, that kind of competition could be run very soon since most of the work is done already =-) who wants to wait months for another challenge to be developed? =-)
2011-12-24T01:12:29  <FranPeruzzi> that's true
2011-12-24T01:12:49  <FranPeruzzi> although I think the organizers probably need about a month's worth of sleep right now
2011-12-24T01:13:04  <Kettling> Yeah risk/diplomacy lends itself to economics as well... each territory provides certain resources and you need to agree to trade with neighbouring territories for good results (of course owning BOTH territories is also good)
2011-12-24T01:13:31  <Kettling> e.g. one territory has iron, the other has coal, the next has oil
2011-12-24T01:13:36  <FranPeruzzi> Another iteration of ants opens itself to more of the same complaints that some people had about beta vs. non-beta participants
2011-12-24T01:14:03  <Kettling> Not that I've been reading Adam Tooze or anything :-)
2011-12-24T01:14:18  <FranPeruzzi> KIettling: are you playing a different Risk than me? I haven't played for ~20y, so it's entirely possible.

2011-12-24T01:15:17  <Kettling> FranPeruzzi: standard risk just gives a fixed resource per territory and all resources are interchangable
2011-12-24T01:15:50  <Extrarius> hrmm, how about settlers of catan meets risk?
2011-12-24T01:15:51  <mleise> Kettling: but... you get at least 3 units and a holding whole continents gives boni
2011-12-24T01:16:20  <Kettling> FranPeruzzi: but if all resources are interchangable then economics becomes pointless
2011-12-24T01:16:47  <FranPeruzzi> I've seen Settlers in the bookstore, but don't know enough about it
2011-12-24T01:16:48  <mleise> also you collect cards when you conquered/freed an enemy country that round. These cards can be changes depending on their combination into 4, 6, 8 or 10 units
2011-12-24T01:17:02  <Extrarius> actually, I'd like to see somebody work out how to do AI for a game like 'magic the gathering'
2011-12-24T01:17:22  <Kettling> The risk game genre lends itself to many extensions... it's well trodden path.
2011-12-24T01:17:25  <mleise> You can decide to wait until you have a max of 5 cards to have better options when changing cards (always have to change three cards for units)
2011-12-24T01:17:44  <FranPeruzzi> I loved MtG when I was in high school (15-20y ago, I probably have cards that are worth $$ now)
2011-12-24T01:18:02  <mleise> cards have countries on them. if you own the country on the card at time of change, you get 2 extra units to be placed on that country
2011-12-24T01:18:27  <FranPeruzzi> mleise: I'm remembering more now. Mostly I remember my dad running around with a makeshift crown after kicking ass against a bunch of kids.
2011-12-24T01:18:54  <FranPeruzzi> Extrarius: Demonic hordes anyone?
2011-12-24T01:19:39  <mleise> :) anyway all these board games tend to be mean for all but one player or the two that allied. risk, monopoly, settlers, ...
2011-12-24T01:20:09  <FranPeruzzi> I put up a suggestion of stratego on the forum, although I don't know how it works with computational complexity -- I imagine we need a certain level of it in order to make things worthwhile
2011-12-24T01:20:14  <mleise> That's when I turned to computer games that offer more depth in the game logic
2011-12-24T01:20:38  <mleise> Demonic hordes?
2011-12-24T01:20:51  <FranPeruzzi> old MtG card. Destroy land on tap
2011-12-24T01:21:34  <FranPeruzzi> haven't played Magic The Gathering in more than 15y
2011-12-24T01:21:40  <mleise> never played these, i don't know if they were popular in germany. i wasn't into fantasy games#
2011-12-24T01:22:51  <mleise> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game) was as far as I went
2011-12-24T01:22:52  <FranPeruzzi> alliances could be an interesting aspect. I saw something either on here or the forums about sending strings back and forth. Although that may be unfair for lone wolves, like I tend to be.
2011-12-24T01:23:11  <Kettling> Prolly want avoid any obvious trademark infringement
2011-12-24T01:23:19  <mleise> actually we should go back to 2 player games :)
2011-12-24T01:23:20  <FranPeruzzi> not that I have no friends, but they aren't programmers
2011-12-24T01:23:39  <FranPeruzzi> Kettling: I imagine that would be a definite consideration
2011-12-24T01:24:04  <mleise> You mean real alliances like on some browser games?
2011-12-24T01:24:20  <mleise> not just ad-hoc alliances during the matches?
2011-12-24T01:24:22  <FranPeruzzi> If the geniuses around here can figure out full-history raking, multi is cool with me. Even with TrueSkill multi was fun,.
2011-12-24T01:24:54  <FranPeruzzi> I guess alliances would be part of the AI. Determining if it is beneficial.
2011-12-24T01:24:55  <mleise> FranPeruzzi: Well, I prefered the even matches in PlanetWars
2011-12-24T01:25:29  <FranPeruzzi> I missed PlanetWars, with a small kid, but I liked the even matchups in Tron.
2011-12-24T01:26:01  <mleise> The games become so unstable. A weak player can drive a strong player into ruin, if a third player also attacks the strong player
2011-12-24T01:26:04  <FranPeruzzi> I think I did take advantage of the luck inherent in the multi-player aspect of ants though. 259 was probably a bit high for me -- thanks RNG
2011-12-24T01:26:30  <FranPeruzzi> I wasn't a small kid, I had one

2011-12-24T01:26:55  <FranPeruzzi> I agree that there is less uncertainty in 1v1 games than we had in ants
2011-12-24T01:27:13  <Kettling> mleise: I lean towards ad-hoc alliances during matches, because after all, it's an AI competition so the AI needs to make the decision on the ground
2011-12-24T01:27:39  <mleise> Kettling: but they are mean in risk already :(
2011-12-24T01:27:49  <Kettling> Getting an AI to make sensible decisions about coordination with another entity is pretty darn difficult
2011-12-24T01:27:58  <mleise> Whenever I play with my mother and sister, they ally against me
2011-12-24T01:28:24  <FranPeruzzi> people who base alliances only on a person being their friend are putting themselves at risk
2011-12-24T01:28:53  <FranPeruzzi> I wonder how it would affect the current rules about changing your game based on who you play
2011-12-24T01:28:53  <Kettling> mleise: Yeah well make sure the AI has no knowledge about WHO it is up against... needs to work from first principles (like that Turing test thingy)
2011-12-24T01:29:18  <FranPeruzzi> Kettling: I like that. Then your alliance decisions are based solely on utility.
2011-12-24T01:29:31  <mleise> but a group of people may always code their bot in a way that it emits signals for their group to ally
2011-12-24T01:29:57  <Kettling> FranPeruzzi:exactly. No way should it be allowed to know the name of who else in on the field (nor any equivalent token)
2011-12-24T01:30:26  <thestinger> mleise: so you don't let people send arbitrary strings, that wasn't really a good idea
2011-12-24T01:30:32  <FranPeruzzi> mleise: the game would have to include a defined list of messages that could be sent between bots
2011-12-24T01:30:40  <thestinger> you just have a way to propose an alliance, and then the player has to accept/reject
2011-12-24T01:30:42  <Kettling> mleise: That would be half the fun, if those secret handshakes are exposed to interpretation by other players.
2011-12-24T01:30:42  <mleise> hmm
2011-12-24T01:30:53  <thestinger> and it would all be visible to every player, so you could figure out which players could be trusted
2011-12-24T01:31:07  <FranPeruzzi> thestinger: interesting
2011-12-24T01:31:10  <thestinger> ofc you have no idea at the start of a game
2011-12-24T01:31:16  <FranPeruzzi> communication in the open
2011-12-24T01:31:28  <thestinger> well, the proposals don't have to be in the open
2011-12-24T01:31:34  <FranPeruzzi> I think that would bias for people with larger organzations though
2011-12-24T01:31:42  <thestinger> but the existing alliances and breaking alliances should be in the open
2011-12-24T01:31:54  <FranPeruzzi> for instance, I work for Xerox. If I get everyone to play, we could organize a protocool
2011-12-24T01:31:56  <thestinger> FranPeruzzi: well, the same "no changing behavior based on the identity of other bots" thing would apply
2011-12-24T01:32:11  <thestinger> not much you can do if you're limited to 1 alliance proposal a turn
2011-12-24T01:32:15  <Kettling> Yeah, I like comms in the open, and also straightjacked comms (like poker or bridge)
2011-12-24T01:32:21  <FranPeruzzi> thestinger: right
2011-12-24T01:32:29  <FranPeruzzi> difficult to enforce though?
2011-12-24T01:33:09  <thestinger> well, they can see all our source code

2011-12-24T01:33:28  <thestinger> I don't think people would try to break the rule if they planned on actually winning - they'd be caught
2011-12-24T01:33:32  <Kettling> Actually, some sort of bidding system might be a good combo along with diplomacy
2011-12-24T01:33:41  <FranPeruzzi> thestinger: true. source is visible to all organizers
2011-12-24T01:33:44  <Kettling> I'm waving hands here...
2011-12-24T01:34:17  <FranPeruzzi> I don't know diplomacy. I opened the wiki link a while ago, but the conversation is moving fast...
2011-12-24T01:34:58  <FranPeruzzi> sorry, I was thinking labyrnth
2011-12-24T01:35:41  <mleise> thestinger: noone looks through 5000 bot source codes, there must be something really suspicious happening
2011-12-24T01:35:49  <thestinger> mleise: yeah, ofc
2011-12-24T01:36:09  <thestinger> but I don't think people would actually try to cheat by building a communication protocol over whatever logic the game gives you
2011-12-24T01:36:28  <FranPeruzzi> but if there's something suspiciuous at the top it would be reported
2011-12-24T01:36:38  <Kettling> I'm getting bashed on tcpants as well, oh well *sigh* at least it isn't using much CPU :-)
2011-12-24T01:36:45  <mleise> is the top the only interesting spot?

2011-12-24T01:37:26  <FranPeruzzi> I definitely don't think the top is the only interesting spot, I would love to see this competition keep its inclusiveness
2011-12-24T01:37:51  <mleise> It doesn't have to be true, but it is like with online polls. People may change their IP and vote twice
2011-12-24T01:38:31  <thestinger> mleise: there are so many people playing, that imo it wouldn't affect the middle ranks
2011-12-24T01:38:32  <mleise> And the respect for the whole thing is gone when the results are not reliable
2011-12-24T01:38:58  <thestinger> you would need like 100 people in a cheater cabal, and it would definitely get leaked out
2011-12-24T01:39:34  <Kettling> Also random shuffle in the games would reduce the value of secret handshakes
2011-12-24T01:39:35  <mleise> Ok, you can propose alliances for the next game of course, you don't convince me though
2011-12-24T01:39:36  <FranPeruzzi> I think if there is a protocol for alliances, it would be in everybody's interest to code something that was utility based instead of user based. Even a 1-point difference in skill was enough in ants to make it so you never see different people in the finals
2011-12-24T01:39:50  <thestinger> mleise: well, it's not necessarily a good idea :P
2011-12-24T01:39:53  <thestinger> just brainstorming
2011-12-24T01:40:06  <thestinger> I agree that n-player games add too much noise

2011-12-24T01:40:28  <thestinger> I was lucky and it closed with my rank @ 30
2011-12-24T01:40:35  <Kettling> Noise is good... I like to win a few you know!
2011-12-24T01:40:37  <mleise> nice
2011-12-24T01:40:42  <FranPeruzzi> so unless you're friends with everyone it would be pointless. And if you're friends with everyone what's the point anyways if you're not being fair
2011-12-24T01:41:09  <FranPeruzzi> I was anywhere in about a 50-spot range today too. It was nerve wracking
2011-12-24T01:41:16  <Kettling> FranPeruzzi: Another diplomacy game might start *OUTSIDE* the official competition

2011-12-24T01:43:38  <FranPeruzzi> yeah, but I think it needs to stay a programming competition
2011-12-24T01:44:22  <FranPeruzzi> something like stratego or risk is looking really good right now, but diplomacy is looking grim without a strict framework
2011-12-24T01:45:16  <mleise> Let's make a cool space game with space goblins conquering planets with mother ships and landing troops. And they would build factories and the A.I. decides what modules to combine to a ship to alter its level of speed, defenses and load capacity.
2011-12-24T01:46:28  <FranPeruzzi> hmm, sounds like a Battletech variant after they added more large-scale strategy

2011-12-24T01:47:04  <FranPeruzzi> something like old-school Traveller would be cool minus role-playing aspects

2011-12-24T01:48:12  <FranPeruzzi> Accoun - putting up some fodder for you
2011-12-24T01:49:03  <FranPeruzzi> you were killing me yesterday
2011-12-24T01:49:37  <FranPeruzzi> Opening family game cupboard...
2011-12-24T01:49:38  <Kettling> Egats, Traveller, I remember when that was a new idea
2011-12-24T01:50:11  <FranPeruzzi> hmm, monopoly, parchisi, othello\
2011-12-24T01:51:02  <FranPeruzzi> never got a chance to actually play Traveller myself. My dad had the boxed set (sorry if that makes you feel old). My friends and I played AD&D2, Rifts, Star Wars (d6)

2011-12-24T01:53:42  <FranPeruzzi> even bh was nasty on TCP. Even though it was supposed to be a 'lower-level' tcp site
2011-12-24T01:53:55  <mleise> Battletech is like a game I invented after playing some simpler form on a sheet of grid paper with friends at school
2011-12-24T01:54:11  <FranPeruzzi> I used to design mechs for hours
2011-12-24T01:54:34  <mleise> but really... all this management of damage and fuel is why I was lucky about the invention of computers :)
2011-12-24T01:54:47  <FranPeruzzi> really
2011-12-24T01:55:04  <mleise> *happy i meant
2011-12-24T01:55:20  <mleise> Does anyone know Battle Isle?
2011-12-24T01:55:20  <FranPeruzzi>  I remember though my dad took me to a gaming convention when I was 10, and I had a Wasp. I got smoked and cried.
2011-12-24T01:55:45  <mleise> haha
2011-12-24T01:55:50  <FranPeruzzi> lol
2011-12-24T01:56:37  <mleise> I called my game, ported from paper, Island battle and then found out about Battle Isle
2011-12-24T01:56:58  <FranPeruzzi> It was pathethic. As a noob, I should have had the Warhammer or Battlemaster, but nooooo...
2011-12-24T01:57:05  <mleise> the hex field map there was a good idea
2011-12-24T01:57:52  <FranPeruzzi> it was, but I think it would be difficult to manage in a competition like this
2011-12-24T01:58:12  <mleise> what exactly? the hex grid??
2011-12-24T01:58:21  <FranPeruzzi> yes, hex grid
2011-12-24T01:58:45  <mleise> I see no problem with that. It was proposed here earlier and noone screamed
2011-12-24T01:58:47  <FranPeruzzi> really only a half phase shift, without much benefit?

2011-12-24T01:59:01  <FranPeruzzi> If it's in starter, it could work
2011-12-24T01:59:09  <mleise> well, you have smoother paths
2011-12-24T01:59:10  <FranPeruzzi> _flag: nice writeup
2011-12-24T01:59:34  <FranPeruzzi> that's true
2011-12-24T02:00:03  <mleise> and the distance is still 1 to every neighbor. this is the downside with diagonal moves on a square grid
2011-12-24T02:00:19  <FranPeruzzi> I like the paths available in hex maps. I remember playing Desert Commander on NES, and it was squares -- I wished it was hex

2011-12-24T02:00:40  <FranPeruzzi> If you don't know how to implement though...
2011-12-24T02:01:20  <mleise> this could be covered by a tutorial
2011-12-24T02:01:23  <FranPeruzzi> like xathis tile implementation was cool, and I should have had something like it but didn't (like all the other things that cause win vs lose)
2011-12-24T02:01:40  <mleise> what did he do?
2011-12-24T02:01:53  <mleise> I wasn't attending the competition for the last weeks
2011-12-24T02:01:59  <FranPeruzzi> nothing special (as far as tiles) just had a tile class
2011-12-24T02:02:18  <FranPeruzzi> but you would need something like that in a hex-based game
2011-12-24T02:02:29  <FranPeruzzi> and I didn't even think of it
2011-12-24T02:02:43  <mleise> but what does the tile class do ? :p
2011-12-24T02:03:08  <mleise> just having a coordinate can't be the magic
2011-12-24T02:04:08  <FranPeruzzi> I think it just has the location and references to neighbors
2011-12-24T02:04:26  <mleise> nah comeon, you didn't think of that?
2011-12-24T02:04:44  <Kettling> FranPeruzzi: Everyone seems to be beating me on tcpants *SOB* I'm still puzzling over the combat engine... but it's also Chrstmas eve so I've put away a bottle of Australian prosecco as err, "thinking juice" to help me along
2011-12-24T02:05:46  <mleise> antimatroid for example implemented A* this way: he used the tiles as nodes and linked them to their neighbors
2011-12-24T02:05:46  <FranPeruzzi> I love the thinking juice. I've put away some Keystone, which is much worse than yours. My combat is nothing to brag about -- I was amazed at the simplicity of the top bots combat.
2011-12-24T02:06:16  <mleise> so there are many opportunities to discover the 'tile class'
2011-12-24T02:06:35  <FranPeruzzi> Right mliese, but in a hex map I think you would have to include an effective implementation in the starter kit to keep the same low barrier to entry

2011-12-24T02:07:38  <FranPeruzzi> Kettling: my problem with combat was that I couldn't pick out the best moves. Since I'm in Python I tried to prune waaay too much.
2011-12-24T02:08:14  <Accoun> http://tcpants.com/ranking lets play
2011-12-24T02:08:27  <FranPeruzzi> I think next year if I program in Python I'll give myself like 5000ms per turn, then once I have a strategy I'm happy with optimize down to get it within tolerance.
2011-12-24T02:08:59  <mleise> it is not like there wasn't enough round time in ants, a game of PlanetWars took 200 seconds max, ants went far beyond that
2011-12-24T02:09:06  <FranPeruzzi> Accoun you and red are already whooping me
2011-12-24T02:09:21  <mleise> but you had to spread your calculations somewhat over the course of several turns
2011-12-24T02:09:32  <FranPeruzzi> yeah, but I think one of my problems is that I started optimizing too early
2011-12-24T02:09:49  <mleise> FranPeruzzi: that happens to me too
2011-12-24T02:09:54  <FranPeruzzi> If I master the algo first, then the speed, things will be better off
2011-12-24T02:09:54  <thestinger> just use C++ and you never have to optimize :P
2011-12-24T02:10:07  <mleise> I'm bad at just writing an ugly prototype and clean up the mess later
2011-12-24T02:10:21  <FranPeruzzi> right, one of the things I want to do this year is make it through my copy of Strousrtroup
2011-12-24T02:10:39  <mleise> thestinger: You have to know C++ as well to avoid performance killers. C is better ;)
2011-12-24T02:10:42  <FranPeruzzi> My code was so nasty compared to the code that was posted
2011-12-24T02:11:00  <FranPeruzzi> I have to get my copy of K&R back, or buy another copy
2011-12-24T02:11:09  <thestinger> mleise: well then you avoid the C++ features except for stuff you've actually learned
2011-12-24T02:11:18  <mleise> well, few people *post* their code in the first place if it makes them look bad
2011-12-24T02:11:27  <FranPeruzzi> Mine is so sloppy
2011-12-24T02:12:18  <FranPeruzzi> But as far as 'looks bad' is concerned, I'm pretty happy with my final rank -- hope to do better next year though
2011-12-24T02:13:25  <mleise> The complexity of the next game may increase even more

2011-12-24T02:14:10  <mleise> Looking at "rock, paper, scissors", Tron, PlanetWars, Ants I see a pattern of increasing complexity :)
2011-12-24T02:14:11  <FranPeruzzi> mleise: that would be ok with me, as long as it doesn't totally disqualify slower langs
2011-12-24T02:14:51  <mleise> FranPeruzzi: Antimatroid wants a very simple game again. One that can be solved.
2011-12-24T02:15:07  <FranPeruzzi> If it gets to the point where langs like Python, Ruby, etc, just aren't viable, It will be time for a new competition to form
2011-12-24T02:15:12  <mleise> One where you can find the perfect algorithm
2011-12-24T02:15:50  <FranPeruzzi> perfect algo is bad
2011-12-24T02:15:52  <thestinger> FranPeruzzi: they were already barely viable :P
2011-12-24T02:16:10  <mleise> FranPeruzzi: Well, the language is a tool. There are several tools. Chose the best for the job ;)
2011-12-24T02:16:20  <thestinger> FranPeruzzi: Fluxid is a professional python programmer
2011-12-24T02:16:23  <thestinger> https://github.com/fluxid/flantob
2011-12-24T02:16:24  <mleise> C will be more work than Python, therefor it is faster
2011-12-24T02:16:43  <mleise> You trade speed for ease of use
2011-12-24T02:16:57  <FranPeruzzi> As a Python coder, I'm starting to feel the same way. Where C programmers were considering all minimax possibilities, I was considering how to prune more
2011-12-24T02:17:03  <mleise> That said, PyPy gives good results
2011-12-24T02:17:04  <thestinger> python:         933 (48.70%)
2011-12-24T02:17:07  <thestinger> ansic:          738 (38.52%)
2011-12-24T02:17:09  <thestinger> sh:             245 (12.79%)
2011-12-24T02:17:31  <thestinger> mleise: yeah, pypy gets you a 5x speed boost and lower memory usage for each object (ofc the JIT uses a ton of memory, but whatever :P)
2011-12-24T02:18:01  <FranPeruzzi> It is a trade off. If you can implement your algo in Python in like the first half, then switch to C for second half, I think that's a good strategy as far as meta is concerned.
2011-12-24T02:18:01  <thestinger> FranPeruzzi: pypy also has optimized ctypes
2011-12-24T02:18:13  <thestinger> and that's much nicer than using a C extension
2011-12-24T02:18:23  <FranPeruzzi> I submitted pypy once, without trying it locally
2011-12-24T02:19:20  <FranPeruzzi> It crashed because implementation of gc module is different (I guess) and I had specifically made gc happen at beginnnig of turn with gc module, then disabled.
2011-12-24T02:20:14  <FranPeruzzi> I'll probably look into it more in the future, although I'll probably concentrate more on doing something similar to Fluxid -- code in py and optimize in C
2011-12-24T02:20:24  <thestinger> well
2011-12-24T02:20:29  *** ruser <ruser!~nomad@23.19.120.250> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2011-12-24T02:20:30  <thestinger> easier just to code the whole thing in C
2011-12-24T02:20:33  <thestinger> than using C extensions
2011-12-24T02:20:42  <FranPeruzzi> not sure though because I don't know the comparative PITA factor
2011-12-24T02:20:45  <thestinger> because the boilerplate and ugliness that ends up in the C makes it way worse
2011-12-24T02:20:55  <FranPeruzzi> may move to C too.
2011-12-24T02:21:24  <FranPeruzzi> probably code algos in py up to about 1/2 through contest, then move to C once I believe in my algos
2011-12-24T02:21:24  <thestinger> or just use modern C++, and don't worry about the 25-30% performance loss over C
2011-12-24T02:21:46  <mleise> Did you look into D? It has some nice stuff like associative arrays and dynamic arrays, that C lacks
2011-12-24T02:21:50  <FranPeruzzi> that's a possibility too
2011-12-24T02:22:07  <thestinger> yeah, D is nice for something like this too
2011-12-24T02:22:37  <FranPeruzzi> Personally, I think I have a lot of room for improvement in my algorithms -- Graph theory, general math, etc
2011-12-24T02:23:11  <mleise> Although I have to say, I'm profiling the code sometimes, because the library implementations are not all at the quality they should be in. BigInt for example is slow.
2011-12-24T02:24:06  <FranPeruzzi> I was profiling my python, and found that there were best practices that would improve my performance by 2x + without moving away from py.
2011-12-24T02:24:41  <FranPeruzzi> although I feel like I really need to know a compiled language to be serious
2011-12-24T02:24:46  <mleise> things like that, yeah. where the compiler/interpreter can deduce some optimizations from the way you write code
2011-12-24T02:25:01  <thestinger> cpython barely optimizes :P
2011-12-24T02:25:19  <thestinger> the performance gains are mostly from using the standard library as much as possible and avoiding certain slow things (for loops)
2011-12-24T02:25:22  <FranPeruzzi> I needed to use cProfile and do my own optimization
2011-12-24T02:25:25  <mleise> In D, foreach (i; 0..n) is usually faster than for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
2011-12-24T02:26:10  <FranPeruzzi> that reminds me of perl, are the range operations similar in D?
2011-12-24T02:26:45  <mleise> I don't know Perl, but in D you have this slice operator on arrays (and user defined types)

2011-12-24T02:27:07  <thestinger> FranPeruzzi: another option is using a fast language, but not necessarily C, C++ or D
2011-12-24T02:27:20  <thestinger> haskell, clojure, scala, etc. will be way faster than python
2011-12-24T02:27:21  <FranPeruzzi> something like Go or Java?
2011-12-24T02:27:22  <mleise> it works with foreach as well, and on arrays you can write [10..$], where dollar means 'end' of list
2011-12-24T02:27:30  <thestinger> but still 2x-3x slower than C/C++
2011-12-24T02:27:38  <thestinger> FranPeruzzi: Java is way worse than C++11 imo
2011-12-24T02:27:39  <FranPeruzzi> I think I need to work on my algos first.

2011-12-24T02:39:44  <dabunny> no
2011-12-24T02:39:50  <dabunny> this is v2 apparently: http://terrarium2.codeplex.com/
2011-12-24T02:40:20  <FranPeruzzi> that's way different
2011-12-24T02:40:37  <dabunny> somewhat similar to ants
2011-12-24T02:40:42  <dabunny> but each ant was independent
2011-12-24T02:40:44  <dabunny> kind of
2011-12-24T02:41:09  <dabunny> each ant only had it's own field of vision, and your ants couldn't communicate directly
2011-12-24T02:41:12  <Kettling> I also liked with the ants that there were a large number of pieces on the board, and far to many moves to allow traditional deep tree analysis
2011-12-24T02:41:29  <dabunny> yes, that was a good twist
2011-12-24T02:41:34  <FranPeruzzi> that was really cool about ants

2011-12-24T02:41:44  <dabunny> the fighting was (for me) sufficiently complex, too
2011-12-24T02:42:04  <FranPeruzzi> I think it was sufficiently difficult for everyone
2011-12-24T02:42:31  <Kettling> Also I like the time limit on code but I would suggest just run a process with ulimit and let the player read their own ulimit to see what they have left to work with... it might legitimately make sense to put more effort into some moves than others
2011-12-24T02:43:12  <dabunny> ah!
2011-12-24T02:43:24  <dabunny> How about a zombies vs humans game
2011-12-24T02:43:39  <dabunny> where everyone controls a zombie or a human?
2011-12-24T02:43:47  <Kettling> All the ulimit stuff is totally well tested, well documented and debugged, man getrlimit

2011-12-24T02:45:02  <arscan> great times guys -- thanks to the organizers!
2011-12-24T02:45:51  <FranPeruzzi> zombies sounds like something that would have appeal
2011-12-24T02:46:55  <mleise> i haz idea for that
2011-12-24T02:47:03  <mleise> you only get a point when you survive
2011-12-24T02:47:13  <mleise> all players are humans
2011-12-24T02:47:21  <FranPeruzzi> yes
2011-12-24T02:47:21  <mleise> to survive you must cooperate
2011-12-24T02:47:28  <FranPeruzzi> zombies are computer
2011-12-24T02:47:56  <FranPeruzzi> start in august, end 10/31
2011-12-24T02:48:02  <mleise> ;)
2011-12-24T02:48:32  <mleise> but how should low ranked players ever win or high ranked players ever lose... hmm
2011-12-24T02:49:00  <Kettling> Do I get to say "economics" one more time?
2011-12-24T02:49:45  <dabunny> first competition is to implement good AI for humans, second competition is to implement better AI for zombies?
2011-12-24T02:50:14  <mleise> that would have to run in parallel
2011-12-24T02:50:15  <dabunny> more fun to do both at once :)
2011-12-24T02:50:22  <FranPeruzzi> Kettling: Is 'economics' guns, food, fuel, etc?    :D
2011-12-24T02:50:40  <mleise> s/fuel/fast food/
2011-12-24T02:50:54  <mleise> s/fuel/coke/
2011-12-24T02:51:10  <Kettling> FranPeruzzi: It's a form of cooperation, my voluntary mutual agreement (and yeah, might involve guns, fuel, etc)
2011-12-24T02:51:15  <FranPeruzzi> an economics game would be cool
2011-12-24T02:51:37  <FranPeruzzi> would having the engine as Open source ruin things?
2011-12-24T02:51:44  <mleise> I have to admit that I like to play Zombie Panic! now and then
2011-12-24T02:52:02  <Kettling> I'm a big fan of Boxhead the Zombie Wars
2011-12-24T02:52:23  <Kettling> If you haven't played it then stop chatting NOW!
2011-12-24T02:52:32  <mleise> Zombie Panic! is like that. You come to share weapons, both humans and zombies are played by humans
2011-12-24T02:52:39  <FranPeruzzi> what game? Zombie Panic?
2011-12-24T02:52:43  <mleise> yes
2011-12-24T02:53:07  <mleise> and collecting dozens of weapons just makes you very heavy and slow
2011-12-24T02:53:17  <mleise> it has also some funny comments
2011-12-24T02:53:23  <mleise> in the voice menu
2011-12-24T02:54:06  <FranPeruzzi> looks interesting. What are the mechanics?
2011-12-24T02:55:09  <dabunny> do the infected humans know that they're infected?
2011-12-24T02:57:18  <mleise> The infected humans know after 30 seconds, after 60 they become zombies
2011-12-24T02:58:12  <mleise> The game has some nice objective maps as well and this creepy feeling when you get left behind and don't know if anyone else is still alive
2011-12-24T02:58:26  <mleise> subway is very well done I think
2011-12-24T02:59:06  <mleise> cinema is also a map that is played often, but it is more the deathmatch/barricade kind of gameplay where the zombies have limited lives
2011-12-24T03:00:17  <mleise> The Source engine physics come into play there, so you can move lockers and couches in the way. But there are also boards that you can pick up and fix to the walls. They have limited durability though

2011-12-24T04:47:57  <bearoff> if even Accoun will tune 'his bot' to beat GreenTea (explicitly and only him) and will write "my bot is better than GT!!", it will not mean anything other than Accoun is some kind of troll and cheater
2011-12-24T04:48:48  <thestinger> http://tcpants.com/replay.3053
2011-12-24T04:48:55  <thestinger> well, he takes the full turntime
2011-12-24T04:49:11  <thestinger> like, tcpants lets you use 5s
2011-12-24T04:50:00  <thestinger> and he says the official server (which does enforce the 500ms turntime) was way slower than his computer (which is probably true)
2011-12-24T04:50:13  <thestinger> if we all had 5s, it would have been a different contest
2011-12-24T04:50:26  <bearoff> right point
2011-12-24T04:50:45  <thestinger> GreenTea's bot could actually be tuned to use a lot more time
2011-12-24T04:50:58  <thestinger> he evaluates every single possibility for battles under 7 ants
2011-12-24T04:51:01  <thestinger> for example
2011-12-24T04:51:04  <thestinger> and ofc he respects turntime :)
2011-12-24T04:51:06  <bearoff> (and if we has top-bots code revealed, it would be another contest too :) )

2011-12-24T11:03:09  <Belerafon_L> Yes, but now, then 8000 peoples... this rule is too optimistic
2011-12-24T11:03:50  <janzert> For the open competition we will certainly continue to allow starter bots. We may find some way to weed them out faster in the finals though.

2011-12-24T11:07:41  <Belerafon_L> All depends of quantity of servers. If google or totaanet will provide 30+ servers  starter bots are not a big problem. But if only 4 server...

2011-12-24T11:08:10  <cYmen> hi.
2011-12-24T11:08:26  <cYmen> I'm sad I missed this. :/
2011-12-24T11:08:59  <janzert> yes, this was not only the most attended competition so far but also the most resource intensive per game.
2011-12-24T11:09:39  <janzert> I'm looking forward to a game with a 50 move average length ;)
2011-12-24T11:10:31  <X-Scale> When will be the next competition ?
2011-12-24T11:10:37  <thestinger> when it's ready :)
2011-12-24T11:11:04  <janzert> no idea, but at least 3 months probably longer
2011-12-24T11:11:06  <X-Scale> And...are there any kind of rewards for the winners, other than self bragging rights ?
2011-12-24T11:11:14  <Belerafon_L> caution! 50 move average may be not so interesting :)
2011-12-24T11:11:34  <janzert> just the bragging rights for now
2011-12-24T11:12:12  <X-Scale> I see.
2011-12-24T11:12:52  <Belerafon_L> janzert: what is the role of google on this competition? (if it is no secret :)
2011-12-24T11:12:55  <Anilm3> bragging rights are quite good
2011-12-24T11:13:15  <X-Scale> yeah...but they don't pay your bills
2011-12-24T11:13:17  <janzert> they provide money for running it (servers)
2011-12-24T11:13:39  <Belerafon_L> and totaanet servers too?

2011-12-24T11:18:44  <sashaSochka> I agree
2011-12-24T11:19:26  <janzert> One thing that hasn't really been talked about and worried me some going into it is that ants is really our first completely "home grown" game
2011-12-24T11:19:33  <janzert> I'm really happy that it turned out so well
2011-12-24T11:20:30  <Anilm3> yeah, it was great
2011-12-24T11:22:47  <Anilm3> also it's a game humans can't play

2011-12-24T11:28:08  <X-Scale> Strange...corewars servers have been running for over 15 years with no major financial hiccups
2011-12-24T11:29:21  <Belerafon_L> X-Scale: now to play 8000 peoples need 40+ servers
2011-12-24T11:30:17  <Belerafon_L> or you want to play on vacuum? For fun tcpservers is ideal
2011-12-24T11:31:44  <X-Scale> Nice. Didn't know about that distributed alternative.

2011-12-24T12:08:23  <Anilm3> thanks UncleVasya
2011-12-24T12:08:32  <UncleVasya> In _janzerts classification this is a -month contest
2011-12-24T12:08:55  <UncleVasya> * a 2-months
2011-12-24T12:08:56  <janzert> 2 months
2011-12-24T12:09:43  <UncleVasya> PlanetWars was active for 3 months (early September - Nobvember 27).
2011-12-24T12:09:46  <X-Scale> UncleVasya: people could compete against each other during the beta phase ?
2011-12-24T12:10:29  <janzert> yes, it was an open beta
2011-12-24T12:10:36  <UncleVasya> X-Scale: yes, but rules were changing.
2011-12-24T12:10:38  <X-Scale> nice
2011-12-24T12:13:55  <X-Scale> TCP servers seem to only accept python bots. Is this right ?
2011-12-24T12:14:14  <UncleVasya> no
