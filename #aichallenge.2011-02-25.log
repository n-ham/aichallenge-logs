2011-02-25T12:17:40  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: so you're leading up the starter packs now?
2011-02-25T12:18:22  <jmcarthur> antimatroid: we should put together a criteria for starter packs. minimal functionality, minimal documentation, maybe a minimal tutorial?
2011-02-25T12:18:47  <jmcarthur> at least for starter packs we want available at launch
2011-02-25T12:23:40  <Frontier> (C++, C
2011-02-25T12:23:46  <Frontier> #, Java, Python)
2011-02-25T12:24:13  <jmcarthur> i'm also hoping to have a haskell one available for launch
2011-02-25T12:25:15  <Frontier> that was just the minimum list
2011-02-25T12:26:23  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-02-25T12:26:29  <jmcarthur> hopefully we have more
2011-02-25T12:26:39  <jmcarthur> even beyond the haskell one i'm doing
2011-02-25T12:27:45  <jmcarthur> a lot of starter packs in previous contests have included entire game states with the ability to query it and even give it orders and step the simulation. is that something we want?
2011-02-25T12:27:49  <jmcarthur> or some subset of that?
2011-02-25T12:28:00  <jmcarthur> other starter packs were basically just I/O
2011-02-25T12:29:56  <Frontier> Well I never wanted that, but someone argumented that it was close to the finals and newcomers had no chance if they started from zero. so it would not be too much of an unfair aid if they get a starter bot that fits the game already by generating the game state for multiple turns
2011-02-25T12:30:37  <jmcarthur> hmm, yeah i can see the importance of that for late game, at least
2011-02-25T12:31:11  <jmcarthur> although i doubt that anybody could make higher ranks with whatever game state structure was provided by the starter packs anyway without heavy modification
2011-02-25T12:32:21  <jmcarthur> some of the starter packs i've seen didn't even give you the ability to look at the orders and updates directly. you could only see the current state of the game, and if you wanted to just see what was different (say, for your own representation) you had to query the game state and compare to the old version
2011-02-25T12:32:28  <jmcarthur> i didn't like that at all, personally
2011-02-25T12:33:00  <Frontier> Well it changes the results a bit when suddenly at rank 400 there are 50 new entries made of these starter packs ^^
2011-02-25T12:33:21  <jmcarthur> i doubt any of them could make it that high "suddenly"
2011-02-25T12:33:33  <jmcarthur> at least, none of the ones i'm talking about were that sophisticated
2011-02-25T12:36:02  <Frontier> I now of one, but it might not have been much in use.
2011-02-25T12:37:22  <jmcarthur> the closest i remember to something like that was somebody posting their bot's source code in the forums in the planet wars contest
2011-02-25T12:37:35  <jmcarthur> a fairly decent bot for that point in the contest, iirc

2011-02-25T14:50:17  <janzert> McLeopold: not sure what sort of virtual disk you're looking for...
2011-02-25T14:50:30  <McLeopold> Whatever was used for the EC2 instances
2011-02-25T14:50:41  <janzert> the AMI used for the last contest is mentioned in the script that did the worker setup
2011-02-25T14:50:50  <McLeopold> AMI?
2011-02-25T14:51:11  <janzert> but *really* shouldn't be used for the next one, since it is based on quite an old version of ubuntu
2011-02-25T14:51:22  <janzert> that's the Ec2 equivalent of a virtual disk
2011-02-25T14:51:40  <janzert> I'm not sure how to get it or run it outside of Ec2
2011-02-25T14:51:42  <McLeopold> is ubuntu easy to upgrade?
2011-02-25T14:52:12  <McLeopold> What about the main server? Was that EC2 as well?
2011-02-25T14:52:28  <janzert> since the setup script works from a clean install of ubuntu, I would just start from the clean install of the latest version and update the script as necessary
2011-02-25T14:52:49  <janzert> no the main server was a dedicated server
2011-02-25T14:53:07  <janzert> not sure where it was hosted exactly, but not part of ec2
2011-02-25T14:53:15  <McLeopold> Same image?  Ubuntu?
2011-02-25T14:53:42  <janzert> it was using the same version of ubuntu as the workers, but not the same image no

2011-02-25T14:54:22  <janzert> that's the worker setup script

2011-02-25T18:41:32  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: what are your thoughts about offering things like an easy way to time moves, debug to file etc?
2011-02-25T18:42:29  <McLeopold> If the starter bots have the logic to loop through existing ants and do something, then at the end of the loop you could do a simple check.
2011-02-25T18:42:38  <McLeopold> I'd say put it in with comments.
2011-02-25T18:43:01  <McLeopold> The starter packs are for newbcakes anyway.
2011-02-25T18:43:42  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm torn between making the starter bots harder to "understand" for beginners and providing stuff that makes "development" easier
2011-02-25T18:44:25  <jmcarthur> honestly, as long as the task is purely mechanical and not strategical or tactical, i see no reason not to include it
2011-02-25T18:44:37  <jmcarthur> aside from perhaps having some material for a tutorial
2011-02-25T18:44:42  <McLeopold> A short blurb at the end of a loop shouldn't be to crazy.
2011-02-25T18:44:42  <jmcarthur> which doesn't seem relevant
2011-02-25T18:45:01  <janzert> include a bare minimum bot for the initial starter and then one with full utilities included
2011-02-25T18:45:03  <jmcarthur> since you would think that a tutorial would be able making actual improvements, not adding boilerplate
2011-02-25T18:45:20  <antimatroid> janzert: i was considering that, but then you have 2 starter bots per language?
2011-02-25T18:45:36  <janzert> I think that's fine if you want to do it
2011-02-25T18:45:59  <McLeopold> The time limit is a big part of the contest spec.  I think it should be in the starters.
2011-02-25T18:46:03  <janzert> every package has to have the bare minimum bot, full utility can be up to the author
2011-02-25T18:46:15  <antimatroid> okay sure
2011-02-25T18:46:26  <McLeopold> It's as important as giving valid moves.
2011-02-25T18:46:35  <antimatroid> i'd still like people to leave the starter bots to just having "utility" like things that aren't relevant to the strategy at all
2011-02-25T18:46:41  <janzert> and "full utility" is likely to vary from language to language anyway
2011-02-25T18:46:47  <antimatroid> McLeopold: timers have never been given in the past
2011-02-25T18:47:04  <McLeopold> I know.  I'm saying change the status quo.
2011-02-25T18:47:09  <antimatroid> yes, sure
2011-02-25T18:48:29  <jmcarthur> timers can have a variety of APIs, too
2011-02-25T18:48:53  <antimatroid> i think we should have the timers timing in milliseconds
2011-02-25T18:48:59  <jmcarthur> polling and interrupting i guess being the main classes of timers
2011-02-25T18:49:10  <Zannick> we would want to be sure the timers we give out in starters are correct
2011-02-25T18:50:14  <Zannick> ie. measures sys time <=> the engine uses sys time, etc.
2011-02-25T18:50:27  <antimatroid> timer should be based off the wall clock
2011-02-25T18:50:40  <McLeopold> any ubuntu gurus here?

2011-02-25T18:50:49  <antimatroid> mine literally just stores the "time" at the start of the turn then works out the "current time" from subtracting that from the current time
2011-02-25T18:51:12  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I think that would be the only type of timer we include
2011-02-25T18:51:58  <antimatroid> How well should I set them up with the timer?
2011-02-25T18:52:35  <antimatroid> my state only has a pointer to a timer which I create at the start of the game so that the states in my tree aren't copying the timer all over teh place
2011-02-25T18:52:35  <McLeopold> a system call to get milliseconds, anything more would be overkill
2011-02-25T18:53:59  * jmcarthur is tempted to provide a way to just get the amount of time left
2011-02-25T18:54:09  <jmcarthur> since that's the math that will happen anyway
2011-02-25T18:54:27  <antimatroid> I don't look at time left :P
2011-02-25T18:54:53  <antimatroid> i basically do while(getTime < 0.9*turntime) extend tree
2011-02-25T18:54:56  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: actually, that makes the most sense
2011-02-25T18:55:50  <antimatroid> i'll give both functions
2011-02-25T18:55:59  <jmcarthur> i'm making the haskell starter fairly library-like instead of template-like
2011-02-25T18:56:18  <antimatroid> yeah, i'm doing my normal everything is public thing
2011-02-25T18:56:24  <antimatroid> if people don't like that they can change it themselves
2011-02-25T18:56:56  <jmcarthur> my intent is for nobody to not like it ;)
2011-02-25T18:57:06  <antimatroid> not possible :P
2011-02-25T19:00:18  <jmcarthur> i wonder if it would be cool to just stick it on hackage as a library and then just providing a simple main along with a readme/tutorial as the starter package
2011-02-25T19:00:50  <jmcarthur> it would even mean that if the library gets updated then it's easy to keep your bot up to date with it without having to merge crap

2011-02-25T19:02:34  <antimatroid> jmcarthur: something like that might work best
2011-02-25T19:02:49  <antimatroid> an optional "toolbox" people could download for each language?
2011-02-25T19:03:40  <jmcarthur> 1. Install the Haskell Platform. 2. Run `cabal update; cabal install ants-starter'. 3. Run `cabal configure; cabal build'. 4. <whatever command necessary to test a bot with the engine>
2011-02-25T19:04:38  <jmcarthur> i'm not even really considering making a toolbox. if somebody else wants to do that they can
2011-02-25T19:05:24  <jmcarthur> i'm basically just providing I/O and some of the most "obvious" utility functions... like, if its definition is longer than one line i'm not even bothering
2011-02-25T19:05:47  <McLeopold> The starter packs should be a competition in itself.  The better I make the python one, the more python people will storm the top of the ranking system. :)
2011-02-25T19:05:56  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-02-25T19:06:07  <antimatroid> McLeopold: it's on :P
2011-02-25T19:06:23  <jmcarthur> i'm honestly kind of thinking that way with the haskell starter. if there's a simple library on hackage there's no excuse not to try it out
2011-02-25T19:06:35  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm just going to wrap yours in a python extension. :P
2011-02-25T19:06:46  <jmcarthur> oooh. i could make the library include an executable to generate your starter for you. all in one place! ;)
2011-02-25T19:20:40  <flag> Is there a set of requirements for starter bots or can it simply be anything that works and does something simple?

2011-02-25T19:27:30  <pyro-> ikarus or mit/gnu-scheme

2011-02-25T19:31:17  <McLeopold> how about guile?
2011-02-25T19:33:23  <pyro-> a compiler would be preferable. i haven't tested it myself but i have heard guile is slow even among interpreters
2011-02-25T19:34:04  <pyro-> but i'm sure its a correct scheme implementation so i could adapt

2011-02-25T19:49:03  <jbroman> Hmm…if you have the universe repo, then "apt-get update; apt-get install mit-scheme" should work.
2011-02-25T19:49:33  <jbroman> I assume you aren't on an older release than Dapper?

2011-02-25T19:53:51  <jbroman> methinks you're on a 64-bit kernel. Which, for some odd reason, has no mit-scheme package in Ubuntu.
2011-02-25T19:54:02  <McLeopold> is there a command to check?

2011-02-25T19:55:23  <McLeopold> do you know if the EC2 instances are 32bit?
2011-02-25T19:55:34  <jbroman> McLeopold: Not sure what they've chosen. Probably amd64 as well.
2011-02-25T19:56:07  <jbroman> (Oh, and the more authoritative way to check APT architecture is "apt-config dump | grep Architecture". But I forgot that earlier.)
2011-02-25T19:56:44  <McLeopold> APT::Architecture "amd64";
2011-02-25T19:56:52  <McLeopold> pyro-: so, yeah, mit-scheme
2011-02-25T19:57:01  <jbroman> I think there's a way to run i386 packages on amd64, but not sure. It's weird that it's only available on i386…wonder why.
2011-02-25T19:57:16  <McLeopold> see pyro's link
2011-02-25T19:58:10  <jbroman> ugh…this should not be necessary. C'mon, packagers, step it up.

2011-02-25T21:40:04  <Frontier> janzert, if you want to serve the replay files from an amazon server you better do something about it, because all the currently exists is the database to store and server replays.
2011-02-25T21:40:17  <Frontier> that exists
2011-02-25T21:40:22  <janzert> yep, cause that's what was used last time
2011-02-25T21:41:01  <janzert> and I don't have time to actually do anything for this contest, except make suggestions and generally bother people :/
2011-02-25T21:41:32  <Frontier> Ok, then there will be no gzip compressed cached game replay :/
2011-02-25T21:42:05  <janzert> yeah, I haven't seen anyone actually working on any of the server stuff so far
2011-02-25T21:42:39  <Frontier> You may want to look at / edit this site: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Teams
2011-02-25T21:42:41  <janzert> although McLeopold was working on setting one up earlier so he must be starting to poke at it
2011-02-25T21:43:19  <janzert> well, it lists me as a source of info which I'm generally fine with :)
2011-02-25T21:43:32  <Frontier> hehe
2011-02-25T21:44:23  <Frontier> It just looks funny... "Who is working on engine/worker?" - "noone, but there is janzert for info if asked nicely" ^^
2011-02-25T21:44:42  <janzert> heh
2011-02-25T21:45:21  <Frontier> I know you WANT to spend your weekends writing code for the good cause
2011-02-25T21:46:05  <janzert> except I've got a few of my own causes to fill up my time right now :{
2011-02-25T21:46:17  <janzert> it is quite tempting at times though
2011-02-25T21:47:47  <Frontier> it is VERY tempting. we NEED your help. otherwise your ideas will just go unnoticed. and everyone wants his ideas to make an imprint.
2011-02-25T21:49:09  <Frontier> Are you one of the people who work at a fulltime job and have freelancer jobs, too? That's something I defenitly want to avoid. :D
2011-02-25T21:49:20  <janzert> hopefully next fall I'll have some time again and can help with that one
2011-02-25T21:49:40  <janzert> just a family business, but it's very seasonal and we're headed into the busy time
2011-02-25T21:50:02  <Frontier> Oh that's nice. What are you into?
2011-02-25T21:50:43  <janzert> it's an audio/visual company. Basically we do anything related to business conference presentations
2011-02-25T21:51:11  <janzert> projection, sound, staging...
2011-02-25T21:52:43  <Frontier> I like this projection ;): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElarFfokR7s
2011-02-25T21:53:40  <janzert> ooh, that does look sweet
2011-02-25T21:54:24  <janzert> anyway I was just taking off when I saw you on, good luck with the visualizer
2011-02-25T21:54:51  <Frontier> thx

2011-02-25T22:32:24  <Frontier> So the meeting is tomorrow and I'll have to stay up another night till 4:00 am in the morning (GMT+1), right?
2011-02-25T22:32:28  <flag> Frontier: if you want to stay up-to-date you can check the contest logs

2011-02-25T22:32:42  <Frontier> the channel logs you mean
2011-02-25T22:32:47  <amstan_> Frontier: why didn't you say this when we were planning the time
2011-02-25T22:32:48  <flag> Yeah
2011-02-25T22:32:59  <amstan_> Frontier: we could have accomodated the australians as well
2011-02-25T22:33:11  <amstan_> even if it was earlier
2011-02-25T22:33:13  <Frontier> Because the time seemed reasonable
2011-02-25T22:33:26  <amstan_> what time zone are you in?
2011-02-25T22:33:40  <Frontier> you all live at the pacific coast, saturday... it made sense

2011-02-25T23:34:47  <pyro-> amstan_ do you know if your server is 64 bit?
2011-02-25T23:35:06  <amstan_> pyro-: which server
2011-02-25T23:35:06  <pyro-> mcleopold discovered its not easy to put mit-scheme on a 64 bit ubuntu
2011-02-25T23:35:18  <amstan_> get the 32 one?
2011-02-25T23:35:23  <janzert> the workers used in the last contest were 32bit
2011-02-25T23:35:32  <pyro-> but i need to know which scheme implementation to write for 'cause they are all a bit different
2011-02-25T23:35:39  <pyro-> apperently there wasnt a 32 bit one
2011-02-25T23:35:42  <pyro-> or smt
2011-02-25T23:36:03  <amstan_> pyro-: so... 64 bit is hard to isntall, 32 bit doesn't exist? what implementation is that?
2011-02-25T23:36:08  <pyro-> idk
2011-02-25T23:36:34  <pyro-> i didnt follow exaclty. im not familiar with ubuntu installation procedures. implementation mit/gnu-scheme
2011-02-25T23:36:44  <pyro-> the ubuntu package is called just mit-scheme
2011-02-25T23:37:18  <pyro-> he was lookign at it becuase i told him a favour either ikarus or mit-scheme. but even another scheme as long as i knwo in advance whcih :D
2011-02-25T23:40:15  <janzert> I really hope it can be worked out to allow binary submissions in future contests, it would solve so much in letting the less mainstream languages participate.
2011-02-25T23:40:28  <janzert> rather than having the burden on us to try and get each one working
2011-02-25T23:46:29  <pyro-> yep! i'd be happy to cross compile if you supported that instead.
2011-02-25T23:50:32  <pyro-> in fact if you never supported scheme i would prolly prefer to submit the output of one of the scheme => C compilers :D
2011-02-25T23:54:41  <flag> Why don't you guys use the 64-bit version from here? http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/
