2011-11-25T08:35:55  <pairofdice> Close enough I guess
2011-11-25T08:41:36  <antimatroid> it's quite messy to collect all targets with a single bfs

2011-11-25T10:48:19  <Fluxid> antimatroid: my design doesn't really allow such things, since i don't remember paths per ant

2011-11-25T10:48:38  <antimatroid> fluxid: neither, but i'm thinking maybe i should
2011-11-25T10:48:46  <luizribeiro> I have a hash table for avoiding this
2011-11-25T10:49:06  <thestinger> antimatroid: I linked to an example of what I do now http://pastie.org/2919790 - the individual ants just move in a direction that brings them closer to a target
2011-11-25T10:49:10  <luizribeiro> (once I do the planning for an ant, I update the hash table accordingly)
2011-11-25T10:49:16  <Fluxid> antimatroid: you mean avoiding collisions n-turns ahead?
2011-11-25T10:49:25  <thestinger> so they do pathfind around each other a bit, but not really
2011-11-25T10:49:26  <antimatroid> Fluxid: yeah
2011-11-25T10:49:30  <luizribeiro> (and once an ant gives up on it's plan or dies, I update it too)
2011-11-25T10:49:41  <antimatroid> like set<pair<Location, int> > to mark when a location is taken
2011-11-25T10:49:57  <antimatroid> but i don't actually generate the paths after i finish path finding
2011-11-25T10:50:06  <antimatroid> i just store the initial search direction and target

2011-11-25T10:51:29  <thestinger> I mean foraging, not pathfinding
2011-11-25T10:51:34  <antimatroid> what do you guys think? is it worth avoiding collisions after next turn?
2011-11-25T10:52:25  <luizribeiro> I think it doesn't hurt to do that. it's just a few more lines of code. :)
2011-11-25T10:52:27  <thestinger> I think it's worth weighting those tiles, so movement through them costs more
2011-11-25T10:52:34  <antimatroid> i'm thinking more time wise :P
2011-11-25T10:52:44  <antimatroid> thestinger: that sounds horrible :P

2011-11-25T10:59:21  <antimatroid> i want to generalise my path finding stuff, but it requires throwing around functions
2011-11-25T11:00:12  <thestinger> C++11 has lambdas
2011-11-25T11:00:26  <antimatroid> what are lambdas?
2011-11-25T11:00:36  <thestinger> anonymous functions you can pass around
2011-11-25T11:00:49  <thestinger> instead of just function pointers and functors
2011-11-25T11:01:49  <thestinger> I think the old C++ way was to pass around functors (structs with operator() overloaded)
2011-11-25T11:02:17  <antimatroid> so gross
2011-11-25T11:02:31  <thestinger> that's what std::less, std::hash and std::greater are
2011-11-25T11:02:33  <antimatroid> how have others generalised path finding?
2011-11-25T11:02:51  <antimatroid> lambdas i take it for you?
2011-11-25T11:02:56  <thestinger> well, not yet :P
2011-11-25T11:03:07  <thestinger> haven't figured out the C++ syntax for them, but that's how I'll do it
2011-11-25T11:03:25  <antimatroid> what a pita :P
2011-11-25T11:03:27  <thestinger> just need to pass in a lambda for stuff like the end condition
2011-11-25T11:03:53  <antimatroid> i need to pass it in for what to do to the state when it finds a target and is updating information
2011-11-25T11:04:10  <antimatroid> i'm making it so it collects a set of targets in one bfs sweep
2011-11-25T11:04:19  <antimatroid> reusing ants that have already been moved if i tell it to
2011-11-25T11:04:21  <thestinger> yeah, you could stick that in a lambda or functor and pass it in
2011-11-25T11:04:35  <thestinger> functors are really weird though
2011-11-25T11:04:45  <thestinger> I think python actually has the same thing... never used it though

2011-11-25T11:29:32  <Anilm3> oh I see
2011-11-25T11:29:37  <thestinger> and it doesn't really work
2011-11-25T11:30:06  <thestinger> it works when enemies don't move :)
2011-11-25T11:30:13  <Anilm3> haha
2011-11-25T11:30:26  <thestinger> for some reason the code for dealing with enemies that move takes a bunch of time, and seems to accomplish nothing
2011-11-25T11:30:36  <thestinger> after another 50 bug fixes it should sort of work
2011-11-25T11:31:06  <Anilm3> I had to recode my bot from scratch in order to repair bugs and clean up a little bit the code
2011-11-25T11:34:22  <thestinger> I really need to clean up my code

2011-11-25T12:19:46  <a1k0n> also it's kind of funny how it does all the cell maze maps for a while, then it does all the other ones
2011-11-25T12:19:49  <janzert> it used to be number of timeouts and crashes but it's obviously not anymore
2011-11-25T12:20:22  <janzert> it's because it is trying to keep the same  number of games per map per day
2011-11-25T12:20:29  <a1k0n> i'm also suspicious of my last game, where pguillory and i both timed out

2011-11-25T12:21:18  <janzert> right
2011-11-25T12:21:45  <janzert> over the next few days they'll probably spread out
2011-11-25T12:22:11  <antimatroid> damn, so i can't have a function pointer to a function for an object?
2011-11-25T12:22:19  <antimatroid> an instance of an object*
2011-11-25T12:22:32  <janzert> you mean an object method?

2011-11-25T12:23:17  <thestinger> I'm reading that atm
2011-11-25T12:23:19  <a1k0n> so.. i assume it's showing me the first 1000 characters of my stdout here when i time out?
2011-11-25T12:23:28  <a1k0n> wouldn't the *last* 1000 characters make much more sense?
2011-11-25T12:23:31  <antimatroid> well i have say void State::updateStuff(), then I want for a State state, void *foo() and foo = &state.updateStuff?
2011-11-25T12:23:35  <a1k0n> er, stderr, not stdout
2011-11-25T12:23:46  <janzert> a1k0n: first and last
2011-11-25T12:24:00  <a1k0n> i only have the first
2011-11-25T12:24:25  <janzert> I think the blank line followed by the line with '..' is the split?
2011-11-25T12:24:37  <a1k0n> oh, i see
2011-11-25T12:25:44  <a1k0n> weird.  it didn't print out the line that appears right after the map that takes a couple microseconds to evaluate

2011-11-25T12:26:58  <antimatroid> otherwise i might just have to have void updateStuff(State &state) outside State?
2011-11-25T12:28:51  <thestinger> I think I'm just going to make a lambda which takes a reference to State as an argument
2011-11-25T12:29:03  <thestinger> and pass that to methods
2011-11-25T12:29:13  <thestinger> I'm pretty much trying to figure out the same thing
2011-11-25T12:29:18  <thestinger> function pointers are really ugly
2011-11-25T12:29:53  <thestinger> std::function<> and lambdas are supposed to make it nice, but I can't find any good documentation

2011-11-25T13:09:40  <antimatroid> how do you copy an object when you have a reference?
2011-11-25T13:10:11  * avdg2 wonders if clone would do the job
2011-11-25T13:10:29  <antimatroid> ie. if you had an input parameter int &ip and you wanted int d=??ip so that it wasn't just a reference?
2011-11-25T13:11:21  <avdg2> antimatroid: your doing it in c++ right?
2011-11-25T13:11:31  <antimatroid> yeah
2011-11-25T13:11:40  <avdg2> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning_(programming)
2011-11-25T13:12:55  <antimatroid> seems it just does it for me anyway
2011-11-25T13:13:00  <antimatroid> nevermind my silly question :P
2011-11-25T13:13:12  <avdg2> I think it was a good question
2011-11-25T13:13:30  <avdg2> most people won't notice that they have a reference instead of a copy
2011-11-25T13:13:48  <avdg2> which is a big logical beginner mistake
2011-11-25T13:14:00  <mcstar> int d=ip; copies ip, wont it?
2011-11-25T13:14:09  <antimatroid> i've made those mistakes enough times to know the difference :P

2011-11-25T13:14:48  <avdg2> objects and arrays are mostly refered

2011-11-25T13:15:07  <antimatroid> still the same if I have like State &state, then State newState = state?
2011-11-25T13:15:13  <avdg2> so for objects and arrays you mostly copy the reference
2011-11-25T13:15:13  <mcstar> yes

2011-11-25T13:28:36  <thestinger> in the C++ starter? no
2011-11-25T13:28:49  <thestinger> you have to see the hill to know if it's still there
2011-11-25T13:29:05  <Anilm3> thestinger: ok, thanks
2011-11-25T13:30:47  <Anilm3> that changes everything :(
2011-11-25T13:31:35  <antimatroid> how do i make the server recognise c++11 when i upload later?
2011-11-25T13:31:48  <thestinger> switch the extension to .cpp and the compiler script uses -std=c++0x
2011-11-25T13:31:49  <antimatroid> Anilm3: it's really easy to make it do it
2011-11-25T13:32:06  <thestinger> the extension on MyBot.xx is all that matters iirc
2011-11-25T13:32:49  <Anilm3> thestinger: the server compiler uses my Makefile?
2011-11-25T13:32:55  <thestinger> Anilm3: no
2011-11-25T13:33:32  <thestinger> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/worker/compiler.py
2011-11-25T13:33:48  <antimatroid> Anilm3: add an oldHills, oldFood etc. vector to state, then read input, update vision, for any old food if the location isn't visible re add it like it was given as input info otherwise it was removed since last seen (or hill razed since last seen etc.), then once you've updated the information copy the current food, hills etc. into the old info vectors
2011-11-25T13:34:17  <thestinger> for C, it compiles all the .c files to .o, then links them together (without link-time optimization sadly, I forget if gcc 4.5 has it though)
2011-11-25T13:34:30  <thestinger> C++ is the same
2011-11-25T13:34:32  <antimatroid> if you're clever you should also be able to track where your ants spawn to see if a hill of yours out of view has been razed because an ant didn't spawn there

2011-11-25T13:35:43  <antimatroid> i actually use sets for those kinds of things
2011-11-25T13:35:44  <Fluxid> do you do any kind of enemy movements prediction?
2011-11-25T13:35:54  <antimatroid> and have like moveable and unmoved ants sets for my ants
2011-11-25T13:35:59  <antimatroid> only for combat
2011-11-25T13:36:13  <Anilm3> they could use march=native on the c/c++ compiler
2011-11-25T13:36:20  <antimatroid> you could presumably "collect food" etc for them and try to cut them off i guess
2011-11-25T13:36:21  <Anilm3> it sometimes helps
2011-11-25T13:36:23  <antimatroid> that could be cool
2011-11-25T13:36:44  <antimatroid> making the assumption that they don't collect food they can get first no matter what
2011-11-25T13:37:33  <antimatroid> if you're going to this much trouble you probably want to hope you're going to do quite well, so it's usually a safe assumption your competition will be reasonably smart about what they do
2011-11-25T13:38:18  <Antimony> I just assume all enemies are stationary
2011-11-25T13:38:22  <Antimony> it works occasionally

2011-11-25T13:40:07  <mcstar> and i need to provide access to the this pointer for example
2011-11-25T13:40:19  <mcstar> i can share data with different objects

2011-11-25T13:40:43  <mcstar> antimatroid: lambdas can capture variables from the calling environment
2011-11-25T13:40:46  <antimatroid> c++ is pretty much the only language i've properly used
2011-11-25T13:41:45  <mcstar> ah, not calling, but where i define that labda
2011-11-25T13:41:55  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-25T13:42:01  <thestinger> you can pass stuff to them where they get called

2011-11-25T13:42:23  <mcstar> its a controlled bridge
2011-11-25T13:42:26  <mcstar> i like it
2011-11-25T13:42:34  <thestinger> antimatroid: basically, you can define a function as a local variable
2011-11-25T13:43:03  <thestinger> and you can have it capture state from the function you define it in
2011-11-25T13:43:18  <mcstar> that too, i can set up a function variable, but after some citerion holds, i can change that function varianle to another funciton
2011-11-25T13:43:30  <mcstar> so i dont neeed to check selection variables all the time

2011-11-25T13:45:52  <thestinger> and you can use auto if you want to assign it to a variable
2011-11-25T13:46:00  <mcstar> you dont need ->
2011-11-25T13:46:05  <thestinger> so 'auto f = lambda' or whatever
2011-11-25T13:46:13  <thestinger> since auto does local type inference in C++11

2011-11-25T13:46:30  <antimatroid> other than that
2011-11-25T13:46:39  <mcstar> thestinger: you dont have to provide return type
2011-11-25T13:46:57  <thestinger> so, 'auto add = [](int a, int b){ return a + b; }' ?
2011-11-25T13:47:03  <mcstar> yes
2011-11-25T13:47:24  <antimatroid> is this so i could have a function for like state.aFunction?
2011-11-25T13:47:27  <thestinger> antimatroid: alright, so try 'auto add = [](int a, int b){ return a + b; }' and then call it as a function
2011-11-25T13:47:47  <thestinger> the first nice thing about it is that you have a local nested function
2011-11-25T13:48:21  <thestinger> so you don't need to jump somewhere else to see the definition for something you only use in one place
2011-11-25T13:48:25  <mcstar> auto addFn3=[this, &rc](int r, int c){
2011-11-25T13:48:39  <mcstar> function<float(int, int)> addFn=addFn1;

2011-11-25T13:49:39  <antimatroid> nevermind
2011-11-25T13:49:49  <thestinger> antimatroid: and you can change the definition of the function, since it's just a local variable
2011-11-25T13:50:19  <thestinger> and you can give it variables from the current function to start it off with some start or whatever
2011-11-25T13:50:41  <mcstar> antimatroid: [] captures the variables
2011-11-25T13:50:49  <mcstar> &rc is captured by reference
2011-11-25T13:51:01  <mcstar> rc is defined where addFn, addFn3 is

2011-11-25T13:55:43  <mcstar> lambdas as function pointers?
2011-11-25T13:55:57  <mcstar> they are different concepts
2011-11-25T13:56:00  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-25T13:56:05  <mcstar> of course you know that
2011-11-25T13:56:07  <thestinger> I didn't think they would be proper lambdas
2011-11-25T13:56:36  <thestinger> after seeing what a 'functor' was in C++ I lost hope for lambdas and just never looked up any docs
2011-11-25T13:56:36  <mcstar> i didnt have time to theorize lambda's abilities

2011-11-25T13:58:51  <thestinger> well, std::less, std::hash, std::greater, etc. are functors
2011-11-25T13:58:51  <mcstar> myclass()
2011-11-25T13:58:56  <mcstar> instead of

2011-11-25T13:59:10  <thestinger> yeah, python lets you define __call__() for the same thing
2011-11-25T13:59:37  <thestinger> but I think the idiom for functors in C++ is a struct with a single method (the operator() overload)
2011-11-25T13:59:51  <thestinger> that's what std::less, etc. are

2011-11-25T14:02:11  <thestinger> I think it's just to get rid of the ugly function pointer syntax, before they had std::function
2011-11-25T14:02:19  <thestinger> and it's also a way to avoid 'evil' static local variables

2011-11-25T14:20:05  <BenJackson> a1k0n: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.14820 quite a battle
2011-11-25T14:20:35  <a1k0n> nice.
2011-11-25T14:20:45  <a1k0n> bummer about the turn limit, i would have gotten you in the end. :)
2011-11-25T14:20:58  <BenJackson> I'm sure I would have turned it around ;-)
2011-11-25T14:21:37  <a1k0n> jesus my bot sacrifices a lot of ants needlessly
2011-11-25T14:23:13  <BenJackson> I'd say I was winning that one in combat
2011-11-25T14:23:24  <BenJackson> but I failed to leave any explorers out there

2011-11-25T14:30:20  <BenJackson> so I know I want "more explorers" but it's hard to draw a line in that game and say where the bot went wrong
2011-11-25T14:30:25  <BenJackson> and exactly what it would do differently
2011-11-25T14:30:29  <a1k0n> right
2011-11-25T14:30:55  <a1k0n> well, i know exactly what to do, but it's hard for me to evaluate different versions of my bot by playing them against each other
2011-11-25T14:31:14  <a1k0n> since they're so similar, they tend to not engage hills and just pick off just-formed battle groups

2011-11-25T14:40:12  <a1k0n> your shell script bot didn't kill holdbot?

2011-11-25T14:42:05  <Fluxid> what's worse, it depends on seed

2011-11-25T14:46:18  <Fluxid> http://paste.aichallenge.org/CHRCm/ cool, someone uses two ants to kill single ants
2011-11-25T14:46:45  <thestinger> that scares me :(
2011-11-25T14:46:57  <thestinger> my ants are going to need a buddy system

2011-11-25T14:53:03  <mcstar> yeah, thats simple
2011-11-25T14:53:04  <BenJackson> my bot would do that too against randombot
2011-11-25T14:53:23  <Fluxid> BenJackson: i'm impressed because i can't do that.. i think
2011-11-25T14:53:24  <BenJackson> if the enemy dodges you basically can't kill them unless you run them into an obstacle
2011-11-25T14:54:12  <thestinger> and then you actually have to chase them down

2011-11-25T15:09:06  <BenJackson> what's keeping me from resubmitting on the official server is that I fixed combat but it turned out my bot sort of relied on the blundering semi-suicidal combat quality
2011-11-25T15:09:18  <BenJackson> so I need to make other improvements to regain parity

2011-11-25T15:28:15  <BenJackson> C++ bot?
2011-11-25T15:28:22  <Antimony> yeah
2011-11-25T15:28:24  <BenJackson> the C++ starter kit crashes on empty input
2011-11-25T15:28:30  <Antimony> how so?
2011-11-25T15:28:41  <BenJackson> it dosen't initialize rows/cols
2011-11-25T15:28:52  <BenJackson> it has no code whatsoever to handle the case of no input
2011-11-25T15:28:56  <Antimony> oh
2011-11-25T15:29:09  <Antimony> well that can't explain why it would crash on say turn 112
2011-11-25T15:29:09  <BenJackson> I never noticed it until I used the tcpclient
2011-11-25T15:29:13  <BenJackson> no
2011-11-25T15:29:28  <thestinger> BenJackson: weird, mine has never crashed
2011-11-25T15:29:39  <thestinger> what's an easy way to cause the problem?
2011-11-25T15:29:44  <BenJackson> crashing on turn 112 is probably a bug in your code stimulated by input you get from complex opponents and not your local testing
2011-11-25T15:29:55  <BenJackson> ./MyBot < /dev/null
2011-11-25T15:30:15  <thestinger> it just outputs 'go'
2011-11-25T15:30:16  <Antimony> but why would it say windows error in the client then?
2011-11-25T15:30:19  <thestinger> and valgrind is clean
2011-11-25T15:30:23  <Antimony> shouldn't it just say my bot crashed?
2011-11-25T15:30:33  <thestinger> I haven't really touched the code for input
2011-11-25T15:30:44  <Antimony> also, if you don't pass input the bot doesn't crash, it just waits for input
2011-11-25T15:32:05  <BenJackson> thestinger: State doesn't initializes rows/cols and then allocates grid iirc
2011-11-25T15:32:15  <BenJackson> so if it happens those are 0 anyway you wouldn't see it
2011-11-25T15:32:39  <Antimony> that happens if you get passed invalid input, not no input at all
2011-11-25T15:32:45  <Antimony> with no input it just waits
2011-11-25T15:32:55  <BenJackson> I mean no input + EOF
2011-11-25T15:32:58  <thestinger> BenJackson: oh, that's true
2011-11-25T15:33:18  <Antimony> maybe I should put in some code to verify that the input is valid
2011-11-25T15:33:30  <Antimony> but that's not the problem here
2011-11-25T15:33:55  <thestinger> weird, it still doesn't crash if I init rows to -1
2011-11-25T15:34:15  <thestinger> there, got it to crash
2011-11-25T15:34:17  <thestinger> -2 works
2011-11-25T15:34:19  <thestinger> xD
2011-11-25T15:35:32  <BenJackson> anyway the tcpclient would time out and close the pipe to terminate the bot and crash it, but I don't think it's giong to matter for normal contest purposes

2011-11-25T15:43:08  <Fluxid> somehow some of my ants refuse to liste and go close to enemy with, for example, -738 points (the more the higher propability to go this way, usually its between 0 and 5)
2011-11-25T15:43:35  <Fluxid> listen, closer, it's*

2011-11-25T15:51:50  <BenJackson> I fucked up a score function the other day
2011-11-25T15:51:56  <HaraKiri> oh man, i've reduced my python bot to an absolute bare minimum, and there are still random slowdowns of 20-60ms. i'm this close to giving up :(
2011-11-25T15:52:01  <BenJackson> I could see from the visualizer it was doing the wrong thing

2011-11-25T15:56:36  <Fluxid> HaraKiri: no idea, i didn't measure time to detect such slowdowns..
2011-11-25T15:57:04  <HaraKiri> sure. i'm just raging into the wild, ignore me :x
2011-11-25T15:57:45  <Fluxid> but maybe someone else knows
2011-11-25T15:57:58  <Anilm3> that's the issue with interpreted languages, you don't really know what's going on
2011-11-25T15:58:21  <thestinger> garbage collection isn't really a problem with cpython
2011-11-25T15:58:23  <Fluxid> HaraKiri: how do you detect that there is slowdown?
2011-11-25T15:58:31  <HaraKiri> yes but it's really just some readings in a bool array. how can that possible not be in the amount of time every time? it is infuriating
2011-11-25T15:58:39  <HaraKiri> a lot of timers all over the program Fluxid
2011-11-25T15:59:13  <thestinger> refcounting is used for everything, I think GC just deals with circular references
2011-11-25T15:59:14  <Fluxid> HaraKiri: you mean you check if function is taking constant time, but it does not?
2011-11-25T15:59:44  <Fluxid> do you measure real time or cpu time?
2011-11-25T15:59:58  <HaraKiri> i've reduced my program to ~20 lines or so, there are no fuctions :D. it's ~1000 array readings. most of the time it's ~1ms, but some rounds it takes 80ms
2011-11-25T16:00:11  <Fluxid> O_o
2011-11-25T16:00:32  <HaraKiri> reduced for tracking down taht bug of course, not the "total" bot itself
2011-11-25T16:00:51  <Fluxid> no idea
2011-11-25T16:01:33  <Fluxid> i have enough optimising and measuring at my job so, sorry, i give up immediately
2011-11-25T16:01:43  <HaraKiri> but rewriting in C++ at this stage is so much work :(. haha ok

2011-11-25T16:09:59  <Anilm3> HaraKiri: rewriting on C++ would give you a lot of advantages
2011-11-25T16:10:16  <HaraKiri> well it would be faster of course. but that's basically it :D
2011-11-25T16:10:26  <Anilm3> it's a good reason
2011-11-25T16:10:39  <Antimony> Hara' dont feel too bad about the slowdowns
2011-11-25T16:10:44  <HaraKiri> i agree! but it's not as nice to write as python
2011-11-25T16:10:48  <Antimony> Even in C++, I've seen random slowdowns of over 30ms
2011-11-25T16:10:53  <HaraKiri> how can that be?
2011-11-25T16:10:56  <Antimony> it's just OS stuff outside of your control
2011-11-25T16:11:03  <thestinger> CPU caches are evil
2011-11-25T16:11:06  <Fluxid> i write in python... and c extension for speedups
2011-11-25T16:11:06  <thestinger> they hate me
2011-11-25T16:11:21  <besh> Question: Are the locations of all of my hills sent at turn 0 ?
2011-11-25T16:11:27  <Antimony> yes
2011-11-25T16:11:33  <Fluxid> besh: they should
2011-11-25T16:11:36  <Antimony> The only solution I've found is to return extra early
2011-11-25T16:11:46  <HaraKiri> it's just so frustrating because by whole bot only takes ~20ms at the starting phase of the game, and then i see shit like 80ms at turn 2
2011-11-25T16:12:16  <besh> Ok. so I can pre-calculate some things for the visisble area around the hill.
2011-11-25T16:12:23  <Anilm3> besh: I don't think so
2011-11-25T16:12:30  <Anilm3> I think they are sent on 1
2011-11-25T16:12:41  <Anilm3> turn 0 corresponds to configuration
2011-11-25T16:12:42  <besh> yes
2011-11-25T16:12:51  <g0llum> besh, your visible area will change

2011-11-25T17:47:26  <Fluxid> what updateVisionInformation does?
2011-11-25T17:47:51  <Anilm3> it puts every tile on viewradius to visible
2011-11-25T17:47:52  <Fluxid> because i don't use any starter package
2011-11-25T17:47:52  <BenJackson> it does a BFS from every ant and computes the eulidean distance at every visit
2011-11-25T17:48:05  <Fluxid> oh boy
2011-11-25T17:48:09  <BenJackson> as a means of finding the vision of all ants
2011-11-25T17:48:13  <Anilm3> it's essentially a BFS
2011-11-25T17:48:18  <BenJackson>         std::vector<std::vector<bool> > visited(rows, std::vector<bool>(cols, 0));
2011-11-25T17:48:22  <BenJackson> that's inside the "for all ants" loop

2011-11-25T17:48:57  <Fluxid> i... don't understand this line, but whatever
2011-11-25T17:49:10  <BenJackson> that's making a 2-dimensional vector of bool
2011-11-25T17:49:20  <BenJackson> first it allocates one row worth of "false"
2011-11-25T17:49:36  <BenJackson> then for every row it copies that row of false to a new one, duplicating it rows times
2011-11-25T17:49:57  <BenJackson> such that visited[r][c] is a bool (initially false)
2011-11-25T17:50:00  <BenJackson> it uses it for the bfs
2011-11-25T17:50:32  <Zannick> do you really use 0 in place of false?

2011-11-25T17:51:42  <BenJackson> my bot has consumed the starter bot like a parasite
2011-11-25T17:51:45  <Antimony> by the way, is there any way to submit my fixed version of the timer if I don't have Git?
2011-11-25T17:51:46  <BenJackson> you can see vestiges of the original

2011-11-25T17:52:21  <Zannick> using 0 instead of false leads to great bugs like

2011-11-25T17:52:50  <Zannick> (gg)
2011-11-25T17:53:04  <AntDroid> any idea how to disable symmetry checking for maps? i can't use a non symmetric map for testing.
2011-11-25T17:53:05  <BenJackson> the spurious semicolons in the C++ start drive me nuts too
2011-11-25T17:53:12  <BenJackson> AntDroid: --food none
2011-11-25T17:53:32  <Anilm3> BenJackson: that disables symmetry?
2011-11-25T17:53:36  <BenJackson> that should just be implied by --scenario because everone is confused by it
2011-11-25T17:53:44  <BenJackson> Yes, the symmetry requirement is for the food placement system

2011-11-25T18:09:54  <thestinger> BenJackson: the fact that it uses std::vector<bool> for that is pretty bad
2011-11-25T18:10:21  <thestinger> because it's a bunch of bitfields, not bools
2011-11-25T18:10:42  <BenJackson> true, can't take a pointer to those at all
2011-11-25T18:10:51  <BenJackson> they really shouldn't have done that
2011-11-25T18:11:09  <thestinger> well you can just make it std::vector<uint8_t>
2011-11-25T18:11:10  <thestinger> silly though
2011-11-25T18:11:24  <thestinger> it's much slower to access a bool vector
2011-11-25T18:11:47  <thestinger> updateVisionInformation or whatever it's called was fast enough so I didn't bother changing it much
2011-11-25T18:12:04  <Anilm3> In that function, that's the least of your concerns actually
2011-11-25T18:12:20  <Anilm3> thestinger: I profiled it and it took almost 40% of the total computation time
2011-11-25T18:12:28  <BenJackson> you want slow, try using the visualizer to verify your vision replacement works!

2011-11-25T18:14:45  <BenJackson> it's going to scale with ant count

2011-11-25T18:18:30  <Anilm3> thanks
2011-11-25T18:19:01  <thestinger> do the other starter bots use a better matrix method or something?
2011-11-25T18:19:31  <thestinger> ah, so the python bot precalculates it then sets it around each ant
2011-11-25T18:21:03  <BenJackson> similar to the python game engine
2011-11-25T18:21:27  <BenJackson> even if you just iterated over the rectangle and tested sqrt every time it'd probably beat the stock C++ impl
2011-11-25T18:26:49  <thestinger> the java starter bot does it the same way as python

2011-11-25T18:33:53  <BenJackson> there's actually a more subtle bug in the C++ implementation

2011-11-25T18:43:40  <BenJackson> although to make that claim I should make a test scenario

2011-11-25T19:17:17  <BenJackson> cowbandit: ok now think what happens when you iterate that
2011-11-25T19:17:23  <thestinger> it makes a list of vision offsets, then paints those around each ant basically
2011-11-25T19:17:28  <cowbandit> Ok, thanks!
2011-11-25T19:17:29  <mtmcannon> cowbandit: oh I see. thanks
2011-11-25T19:18:17  <thestinger> much faster than the BFS the C++ bot does
2011-11-25T19:18:26  <thestinger> and I was lazy so I did the same thing for attackradius
2011-11-25T19:18:27  <mtmcannon> er, thanks to thestinger that is
2011-11-25T19:18:33  <cowbandit> lol
2011-11-25T19:18:53  <thestinger> I just made the function generic and used it all over, so my whole bot got faster by overcoming that laziness
2011-11-25T19:19:15  <BenJackson> I might have finally found the right knob to install in my bot
2011-11-25T19:19:22  <BenJackson> a whole new class of knob I had not exploited
2011-11-25T19:19:25  <BenJackson> muahaha
2011-11-25T19:19:32  <Antimony> knob?
2011-11-25T19:20:14  <BenJackson> tunable parameter

2011-11-25T19:21:47  <BenJackson> optimize old code
2011-11-25T19:21:49  <thestinger> yeah
2011-11-25T19:21:52  <thestinger> I like doing that

2011-11-25T19:22:02  <BenJackson> add some new metadata I detect about the map
2011-11-25T19:22:04  <thestinger> needs to be polished up a lot later

2011-11-25T19:23:34  <Antimony> I should try that
2011-11-25T19:23:46  <BenJackson> I'm not sure
2011-11-25T19:23:48  <BenJackson> I didn't used to check
2011-11-25T19:23:54  <thestinger> ah
2011-11-25T19:23:57  <thestinger> I use dead ants for that
2011-11-25T19:23:59  <Antimony> I don't have any hill razing code in my bot. I just pretend that hills are food
2011-11-25T19:24:02  <BenJackson> I think now there's some heuristic about seeing it empty before I charge in
2011-11-25T19:24:06  <thestinger> to figure out if they're staying on the hill or moving off

2011-11-25T19:24:32  <thestinger> worst case scenario is that someone counters my exact code and it's like I just didn't handle that little thing at all
2011-11-25T19:24:36  <BenJackson> I tried to make my ants more defensive
2011-11-25T19:24:44  <BenJackson> then I ran a test game and saw my lone defender run away
2011-11-25T19:24:50  <thestinger> lol
2011-11-25T19:24:53  <BenJackson> and then I realized it was right -- all it could have done was suicide, which  is still bad
2011-11-25T19:25:00  <thestinger> well
2011-11-25T19:25:02  <thestinger> maybe
2011-11-25T19:25:07  <BenJackson> in that exact case
2011-11-25T19:25:11  <thestinger> maybe the enemy would have taken an extra turn to attack
2011-11-25T19:25:14  <thestinger> based on their combat code
2011-11-25T19:25:17  <thestinger> and you might get an extra ant
2011-11-25T19:25:30  <BenJackson> in this case it was my lone ant and a wall of 3 bearing down, but yes
2011-11-25T19:25:46  <thestinger> time for more lambdas :)
2011-11-25T19:25:57  <BenJackson> you're using boost::lambda?

2011-11-25T19:31:48  <thestinger> the official docs are good
2011-11-25T19:31:52  <BenJackson> the internals are very simple really
2011-11-25T19:31:59  <BenJackson> whereas there are a zillion commands
2011-11-25T19:32:00  <thestinger> http://book.git-scm.com/3_getting_a_git_repository.html
2011-11-25T19:32:03  <thestinger> starting there basically
2011-11-25T19:32:15  <BenJackson> once you know the internals then it's much easier to reason about what the commands do
2011-11-25T19:32:26  <thestinger> well "community book" (official enough for me)
2011-11-25T19:32:28  <BenJackson> or realize a command to do "X" must exist because it's obviously useful

2011-11-25T19:34:31  <cowbandit> ops quick question: I want to iterate through each of my ants to perform moves, but what if ant1's move depended on ant100's projected move? Would I have to iterate through my ants multiple times to check for the projected moves? Or is there a more efficient way to do this
2011-11-25T19:35:24  <Antimony> I just wrote a constraint solver
2011-11-25T19:35:37  <Antimony> it assigns moves to all ants at once
2011-11-25T19:35:49  <BenJackson> same here pretty much
2011-11-25T19:35:51  <ikaros> cowbandit, you can implement a push method on your ants
2011-11-25T19:35:53  <cowbandit> oh ok
2011-11-25T19:36:06  <BenJackson> although early on I just used an algorithm which happened to yield "compatible" resutls for all ants
2011-11-25T19:36:07  <ikaros> so one tells the other that it wanna take its place
2011-11-25T19:36:24  <Antimony> oh, I have to tell GitHub my public key
2011-11-25T19:36:25  <ikaros> and the other tries to move first
2011-11-25T19:36:32  <ikaros> you can do it recursively
2011-11-25T19:36:36  <cowbandit> oh i see what you mean
2011-11-25T19:36:43  <cowbandit> oi thanks
2011-11-25T19:36:48  <ikaros> just avoid cycles :)

2011-11-25T19:38:18  <Antimony> only 20?
2011-11-25T19:38:20  <Antimony> Why not do infinite?
2011-11-25T19:38:34  <BenJackson> might as well be reasonable about how many replays I'll watch
2011-11-25T19:38:41  <BenJackson> I run an old version full time for other people to practice on
2011-11-25T19:39:07  <cowbandit> lol speaking of which, do you know if running a ton of iterations will hurt your computer?
2011-11-25T19:39:08  <BenJackson> holy crap I must be playing a slow bot
2011-11-25T19:39:13  <cowbandit> because sometimes when i'm on the tcp server
2011-11-25T19:39:18  <BenJackson> with 1 ant turns are taking 1s+
2011-11-25T19:39:27  <cowbandit> and i have like 200+ ants, my computer beeps every time there's a turn
2011-11-25T19:39:53  <BenJackson> shouldn't hurt your computer
2011-11-25T19:40:00  <cowbandit> it's like a clicking sound
2011-11-25T19:40:07  <thestinger> my old desktop is really screwed up and I can _hear_ CPU load
2011-11-25T19:40:14  <Antimony> my bot is running infinitely
2011-11-25T19:40:16  <thestinger> it makes a high pitched noise
2011-11-25T19:40:18  <Antimony> so it can keep you company
2011-11-25T19:40:19  <BenJackson> the thermal diodes in modern CPUs are so sensitive that the CPU fan can ramp up almost instantly under load
2011-11-25T19:40:21  <Antimony> and bump up your score
2011-11-25T19:40:30  <thestinger> it's probably something about to explode in the PSU :\
2011-11-25T19:40:31  <cowbandit> lol ok, so i'm good then?
2011-11-25T19:41:12  <BenJackson> Antimony: The best part about resubmitting to aichallenge was krushing bots until I got close to my final place

2011-11-25T19:42:17  <Antimony> Woohoo, I sucessfully sshed to github

2011-11-25T19:49:40  <Antimony> ug, more random timeouts
2011-11-25T19:49:45  <BenJackson> the mapgens really need code to detect stalemate chokepoints like that
2011-11-25T19:49:50  <Antimony> it's so depressing getting 0 every single game
2011-11-25T19:49:52  <thestinger> they stop foraging because my limit on defenders doesn't work
2011-11-25T19:49:57  <BenJackson> mabye all fixed-width halls are, though, given the combat rules
2011-11-25T19:50:08  <Antimony> no
2011-11-25T19:50:12  <thestinger> I'm mostly fine with chokepoints now
2011-11-25T19:50:14  <Antimony> according to my calculations
2011-11-25T19:50:23  <Antimony> any chokepoint of width at least 3 can't be a stalemate
2011-11-25T19:50:29  <thestinger> I'm just going to have to adjust how the 'score' I use for combat is calculated

2011-11-25T20:24:26  <bmh> a1k0n: I was thinking of trying a polya's urn appraoch where each ant pushes its move into the urns of nearby ants

2011-11-25T20:25:09  <a1k0n> i don't follow
2011-11-25T20:25:14  <newant> hey anybody doin it in c here?
2011-11-25T20:25:41  <a1k0n> newant: c++, but what's your question?
2011-11-25T20:26:26  <newant> no i need a c kind of guide for getting started coz i dont understand python could u guide me a little
2011-11-25T20:26:27  <thestinger> my nearby_enemies and nearby_friends functions are so much faster now :)
2011-11-25T20:27:29  <a1k0n> bmh: i guess you're assuming nearby ants will want to go the same direction, envisioning a sort of "wall of ants"?
2011-11-25T20:27:36  <bmh> a1k0n: start with a uniform distribution for each ant, run minimax/maximin for each ant and push the resulting move to the nearby ants (if you decide to move West, nearby ants become more likely to move West)
2011-11-25T20:28:52  <a1k0n> that might be worth trying, hm
2011-11-25T20:29:17  <bmh> I don't think it will converge.
2011-11-25T20:30:31  <newant> alk0n can you b kind enough to direct me to a guide in c
2011-11-25T20:32:31  <bmh> still working on my pathfinder. It just topped 100 lines, which is about enough to write a window manager.
2011-11-25T20:32:33  <a1k0n> for.. the tutorial of this contest?
2011-11-25T20:32:48  <newant> yes
2011-11-25T20:32:48  <Antimony> hooray!
2011-11-25T20:33:05  <Antimony> Of all the games on tcp, my bot finally didn't get last place!
2011-11-25T20:33:30  <a1k0n> i don't think such a thing exists.
2011-11-25T20:33:44  <a1k0n> you'll have to read the java one and try to figure out how the C starter pack does it
2011-11-25T20:34:02  <Antimony> by the way, I just submitted by improved c++ timer
2011-11-25T20:34:10  <Antimony> hopefully it will be included in the starter pack
2011-11-25T20:34:34  <newant> ok anything for c++ maybi can draw parallels
2011-11-25T20:37:31  <newant> anybody please i really want to do this but for lack of knowledge or python and experience i am finding it tough
2011-11-25T20:37:56  <newant> if anybody could help i would really b grateful

2011-11-25T20:45:53  <BenJackson> bmh: it was kind of seething there
2011-11-25T20:46:34  <bmh> BenJackson: whoa. He had 100 ants stored up! I didn't notice
2011-11-25T20:46:51  <BenJackson> neither did my bot!
2011-11-25T20:49:44  <antimatroid> hmmm, it's a bit messy to make sure you don't walk an ant onto an acjacent food square
2011-11-25T20:50:34  <BenJackson> I had to fix a few bugs with that
2011-11-25T20:50:40  *** Ikol is now known as Rav3nSw0rd
2011-11-25T20:50:41  <antimatroid> since you don't mind after the first "move" whether it walks over food but you do care if a second adjcant ant then tries to pathfind over a square where an ant has to stay still to collect it
2011-11-25T20:50:50  <antimatroid> yeah, i just realised last night my logic isn't sound
2011-11-25T20:51:02  <BenJackson> you also have to factor it into combat :)
2011-11-25T20:51:08  <antimatroid> yeah that's easy
2011-11-25T20:51:22  <antimatroid> i'm just going to say collected food for a bot is -- to deaths :P
2011-11-25T20:51:36  <antimatroid> then my battle code will do the rest
2011-11-25T20:51:46  <newant> <benjackson> are you doing it in c?

2011-11-25T20:52:54  <thestinger> BenJackson: so your ants push each other or something now?
2011-11-25T20:53:04  <antimatroid> push?
2011-11-25T20:54:18  <thestinger> I think I'm just tired xD
2011-11-25T20:54:37  <antimatroid> no, i do a sort of separate bfs from all ants simultaneously with a single search queue, then when i move an ant i possibly re use it and add in search information for it (and its availability) at it's path destination location and if the ant was previously unmoved for each of it's non-moved into but searched adjacent squares i add moves for any adjcaent unmoved ants into those locations
2011-11-25T20:54:49  <antimatroid> that last bit is how i avoid collisions
2011-11-25T20:55:00  <antimatroid> (answering for myself :P)
2011-11-25T20:55:20  <antimatroid> and i do that to collect a set of targets
2011-11-25T20:55:46  <antimatroid> remove pretty much all the 's
2011-11-25T20:56:13  <antimatroid> BenJackson: is yours much like that?
2011-11-25T20:56:27  <antimatroid> that's my generalised collect targets with bfs
2011-11-25T20:56:51  <antimatroid> i may write one for a* too but when the number of targets is large i don't trust my heuristic function to not be too slow
2011-11-25T20:57:27  <BenJackson> similar
2011-11-25T20:58:05  <antimatroid> oh crud
2011-11-25T20:58:08  <BenJackson> thestinger: oh you don't meant adjacent
2011-11-25T20:58:14  <bmh> antimatroid: you aren't just using a manhattan heuristic?
2011-11-25T20:58:18  <BenJackson> thestinger: you could think of it like that
2011-11-25T20:58:27  <antimatroid> bmh: h(x) = min manhatten distance from x to a target
2011-11-25T20:58:44  <bmh> Oh, by slow you mean "will expand too many nodes"
2011-11-25T20:58:46  <antimatroid> if the number of targets is large and you're calling that for every location you search i'm not sure if that's worse than just using bfs?
2011-11-25T20:58:58  <BenJackson> thestinger: they don't literally push (like a gravity simulation) but they maximize a condition that causes them to spread out
2011-11-25T20:59:14  <BenJackson> which is basically what I've been trying to achive since I submitted V7 to aichallenge
2011-11-25T20:59:21  <antimatroid> no, i mean for each search location you have to calculate the manhatten distance to each of the targets
2011-11-25T20:59:30  <BenJackson> but most of my attempts got me rapidly snuffed out because my code kind of relied on travelling en masse
2011-11-25T20:59:32  <antimatroid> if the number of targets is large surely that would slow things down quite a bit?
2011-11-25T21:00:00  <bmh> antimatroid: I've been slaving away at my hierarhical A* pathfinder... which hopefully I'll finish one of these days
2011-11-25T21:00:10  <antimatroid> hierarchical?
2011-11-25T21:00:15  <bmh> I'm concerned that my pre-processor won't be fast enough, and I need to add incremental updates to it
2011-11-25T21:00:20  <antimatroid> are any of you using multi target a*?
2011-11-25T21:00:52  <antimatroid> i "was", but it's really broken
2011-11-25T21:01:02  <BenJackson> multi target bfs
2011-11-25T21:01:05  <antimatroid> hence i'm generalising my pathfinding stuff so it only needs to be right in one place
2011-11-25T21:01:19  <antimatroid> yeah that's what i'm working on now, but it might be neat to have multi target a* too
2011-11-25T21:01:25  <BenJackson> I don't do any A*
2011-11-25T21:01:30  <BenJackson> I implemented it for my early python effort
2011-11-25T21:02:54  <antimatroid> i just realised i don't think i need path information for ants to be separate

2011-11-25T21:05:09  <bmh> is anyone estimating the portion of the map controlled by your opponents? It seems to me that if you have low 'map share' you should more aggresively trade in order to break out
2011-11-25T21:05:35  <antimatroid> BenJackson: do you store separate path information numbers for each ant? or just for the whole search?
2011-11-25T21:06:01  <antimatroid> i think my reuse of ants requires me to have separate path info for each ant, but i'm not positive :\
2011-11-25T21:06:17  <antimatroid> bmh: no but it's fairly easy to do
2011-11-25T21:06:38  <antimatroid> you probably want to be super offensive if you have lots more ants and less territory than an enemy
2011-11-25T21:07:54  <cowbandit> aughh this game makes me cringe: http://ants.fluxid.pl/replay.12515
2011-11-25T21:09:12  <bmh> cowbandit: why are you parking ants around your hill like that?
2011-11-25T21:09:40  <bmh> sure, it will stop a wandering ant, but it won't do jack against a reasonable opponent
2011-11-25T21:09:49  <cowbandit> yeah that's a good point
2011-11-25T21:10:04  <cowbandit> do you think it'd be better to just have 1 ant parked?
2011-11-25T21:10:15  <cowbandit> or are static defenses like bad in general?
2011-11-25T21:11:18  <bmh> static defenses are as good as useless
2011-11-25T21:11:44  <antimatroid> cowbandit: parked ants are a bad idea
2011-11-25T21:11:57  <cowbandit> blah
2011-11-25T21:12:12  <antimatroid> if that location is selected for spawning food it will wait to spawn it there until you move your ant
2011-11-25T21:12:25  <cowbandit> ah
2011-11-25T21:12:28  <antimatroid> it'll even queue them up and wait to spawn them
2011-11-25T21:12:41  <cowbandit> i guess i was hesitant patrol groups though
2011-11-25T21:12:47  <cowbandit> i just don't know how to implement them
2011-11-25T21:13:35  <thestinger> I'm gonna go to sleep now, cya
2011-11-25T21:13:40  <antimatroid> that was the most fair thing i could come up with for symmetric food spawning to work
2011-11-25T21:14:04  <antimatroid> it means your ants can't potentially influence where food will spawn elsewhere on the map
2011-11-25T21:14:13  <antimatroid> only prevent food from spawning adjacent to you
2011-11-25T21:14:26  <antimatroid> until you move, so you better move before an enemy comes in :P

2011-11-25T21:27:36  <antimatroid> well, you want more rows to get rid of the wrapping thing

2011-11-25T21:28:23  <antimatroid> assume no wrapping
2011-11-25T21:28:37  <antimatroid> atm my bot doesn't do that properly
2011-11-25T21:28:47  <antimatroid> it would use the left ant to collect both food items

2011-11-25T21:29:41  <BenJackson> against lesser opponents the "dive on the ant hill" thing works
2011-11-25T21:29:49  <BenJackson> but against better opponents you need to win the map, then win the hill
2011-11-25T21:29:57  <cowbandit> yeah

2011-11-25T21:30:17  <cowbandit> do you think a strategy of attrition would be better?
2011-11-25T21:30:23  <cowbandit> like what if i just focused on scouting and getting food
2011-11-25T21:30:29  <antimatroid> anyone looked at my example? would your bots use one or both ants to collect the food if you're reusing ants?
2011-11-25T21:30:30  <cowbandit> and not really care about hills

2011-11-25T21:32:27  <antimatroid> and that the ant will be alive afterwards

2011-11-25T21:37:15  <cowbandit> the tide turns due to a stroke of luck

2011-11-25T21:57:29  <amstan_> antimatroid: check it out: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=128653&user=4513
2011-11-25T21:57:55  <amstan_> contestbot: later tell mcleopold congrats at making such awesome game rules, this looks almost like a real fight: http://aichallenge.org/visualizer.php?game=128653&user=4513
2011-11-25T21:57:55  <contestbot> amstan_: OK
2011-11-25T22:03:53  <Antimony> wow, the thin red line
2011-11-25T22:03:59  <Antimony> I wonder what combat algorithms they use

2011-11-25T22:10:15  <a1k0n> but no actual ants were harmed
2011-11-25T22:12:15  <besh> when a territory is breached, they send reinforcements immediately.
2011-11-25T22:12:55  <besh> i am guessing they have some kind of influence maps. but what do i know

2011-11-25T22:29:04  <besh> Instead of going into the terriroty, go there and "pause" at the frontier.
2011-11-25T22:29:28  <besh> 4 vs 2 for the new version.

2011-11-25T23:27:29  <antimatroid> here's a question, normally you might have say const Object &varName for an input parameter, when defining a function<void<Object&> >, how do you make Object& a constant reference?
2011-11-25T23:29:09  <antimatroid> janzert: can i just trust that the guy did it alright? :P
2011-11-25T23:29:54  <antimatroid> the windows timer always sucked, but the other one (which would be used on the server) is solid
2011-11-25T23:35:38  <antimatroid> "const Location&" would that be right? for being a constant reference to a Location?
2011-11-25T23:35:41  <antimatroid> it compiles
