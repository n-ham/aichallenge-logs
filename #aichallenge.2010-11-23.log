2010-11-23T01:48:14  <antimatroid> a lot of people are submitting this week
2010-11-23T01:48:33  <antimatroid> that could be causing people to have to wait longer for their submissions to be compiled?
2010-11-23T01:49:00  <janzert> that's true but it did get stuck just now

2010-11-23T01:50:28  <janzert> great, backlog is down to 1

2010-11-23T02:01:32  <antimatroid> nice
2010-11-23T02:01:54  <antimatroid> that reminds me, i'm getting back to my bot
2010-11-23T02:02:03  <rebelxt_> medrimonia2: nice!
2010-11-23T02:06:50  <rebelxt_> weird game - two full position swaps! http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1156727 lol
2010-11-23T02:11:23  <burny> weirds, I beat 3 ranked 1400-1800 bots, and then wound up facing rank 400's
2010-11-23T02:13:13  <janzert> you also beat rank 408 in there
2010-11-23T02:13:26  <burny> ya..
2010-11-23T02:13:35  <burny> but from 1400 to 400 is quite a jump
2010-11-23T02:14:07  <janzert> you can randomly be paired with anyone, just you're most likely to be paired with a nearby rank
2010-11-23T02:14:33  <burny> ahh
2010-11-23T02:14:37  <janzert> since you had very little game history when you beat the 409 it pushed your rank way up

2010-11-23T08:01:17  <antimatroid1> it's alright, the move wouldn't even be considered once stuff is added back in
2010-11-23T08:01:33  <phreeza> how come you do partial captures? is that intendet?
2010-11-23T08:01:43  <phreeza> intended*
2010-11-23T08:01:47  <antimatroid1> it would have planned to capture it
2010-11-23T08:01:52  <antimatroid1> but it was no longer feasible
2010-11-23T08:02:02  <antimatroid1> although i did notice the planet in that match, and it was feasible aha

2010-11-23T08:09:21  <antimatroid1> i think it should be
2010-11-23T08:09:40  <antimatroid1> it would make sense for it to screw up sometimes, and i'm not getting that many invalid orders, like one very few games on tcp if that

2010-11-23T08:59:13  <bhasker> morning
2010-11-23T08:59:15  <bhasker> :)
2010-11-23T08:59:40  <medrimonia> I don't think that I'll be ranked like now during the final contest...
2010-11-23T09:00:20  <medrimonia> But I don't know if I've really the time to make a good improvement...
2010-11-23T09:00:41  <antimatroid1> i have the time
2010-11-23T09:00:49  <antimatroid1> i'm hoping for top 10 again
2010-11-23T09:00:58  <antimatroid1> i lost hope a week ago, but it's back now that my bot is pulling together
2010-11-23T09:01:37  <antimatroid1> boo yeah, there's the thunder
2010-11-23T09:01:42  <medrimonia> I think that top 10 will be to hard for me
2010-11-23T09:01:42  <antimatroid1> it's definitely summer time
2010-11-23T09:01:56  <antimatroid1> it's hard for anyone, it's really competitive in the top 30 this time
2010-11-23T09:02:07  <antimatroid1> and there's quite a few people i expect up there that haven't submitted in a while too
2010-11-23T09:02:12  <antimatroid1> if they're still working
2010-11-23T09:02:24  <medrimonia> Yes Like McLeopold
2010-11-23T09:03:59  <medrimonia> You're new bot seems to perform very well on tcp
2010-11-23T09:04:00  <antimatroid1> shangas and george are still clinging to top 10
2010-11-23T09:04:07  <antimatroid1> it's hit and miss atm
2010-11-23T09:04:14  <antimatroid1> hopefully i can remove a lot of the misses before game day
2010-11-23T09:04:36  <antimatroid1> i have another idea for game tree implementation too, but i want this to be at a submittable state before i try that
2010-11-23T09:04:46  <antimatroid1> should be able to implement the change in half a day or so and see what it's like
2010-11-23T09:05:10  <medrimonia> I'll change my way of expanding before the deadline I think
2010-11-23T09:05:23  <medrimonia> And I will maybe make synchronised attacks
2010-11-23T09:06:02  <antimatroid1> i depend on my game tree not only making synchronised attacks, but planning what moves it can make after the other moves have been made in the game tree
2010-11-23T09:06:09  <antimatroid1> that works wonders for expanding better than someone else
2010-11-23T09:07:41  <medrimonia> I'm almost satisfied by my first turn move, but I still need to write some specific things for the second one
2010-11-23T09:08:07  <antimatroid1> the big problem with the way i currently do my game tree is that i don't model the opponent expanding
2010-11-23T09:08:26  <antimatroid1> but it has benefits over the other method i want to try too, so i'm at a loss at to what i'll use if i get both done
2010-11-23T09:08:41  <antimatroid1> hopefully one will clearly be better :)

2010-11-23T09:26:35  <Mistmanov> hope so, otherwise all the coding on the bot was for nothing -_-
2010-11-23T09:27:05  <medrimonia> What I can't understand is that even among the top 20 player, some are still sniped at their first move
2010-11-23T09:28:00  <Mistmanov> if your bot is written to completely avoid sniping (mine is supposed to be written that way...) you're way too conservative
2010-11-23T09:28:16  <Mistmanov> and others can get more expansion
2010-11-23T09:28:18  <medrimonia> for the twentieth turn maybe
2010-11-23T09:28:36  <medrimonia> But for the first turn you have to be a little bit conservative
2010-11-23T09:28:40  <bhasker> you can't avoid snipe in some maps
2010-11-23T09:28:43  <medrimonia> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=8438693
2010-11-23T09:28:44  <bhasker> on some maps you just over extend
2010-11-23T09:28:47  <bhasker> and the other bot doesn't
2010-11-23T09:28:51  <bhasker> you get sniped
2010-11-23T09:28:59  <bhasker> there is no way to completely avoid it
2010-11-23T09:29:06  <bhasker> without sacrificing growth
2010-11-23T09:29:38  <medrimonia> Hmmm I disagree, I think that during the ships that you send during the first turn must not be snipable
2010-11-23T09:29:48  <medrimonia> -during
2010-11-23T09:30:16  <bhasker> how do you decide that they must be unsnipable?
2010-11-23T09:30:25  <medrimonia> it's pretty easy
2010-11-23T09:30:27  <bhasker> as in rather how do you decide what is not snipable?
2010-11-23T09:30:34  <antimatroid1> medrimonia: i'm with you
2010-11-23T09:30:59  <bhasker> hmm how do you guys decide that though
2010-11-23T09:31:06  <medrimonia> av_distance=t_minlen_e[destination]-t_minlen_f[destination]
2010-11-23T09:31:29  <bhasker> e=enemy ? f =friendly?
2010-11-23T09:31:30  <medrimonia> where t_minlen_e is the minimal distance to an enemy planet and f to a friend
2010-11-23T09:31:32  <medrimonia> yep
2010-11-23T09:31:43  <bhasker> k and?
2010-11-23T09:31:55  <bhasker> if that is >0 don't send i guess?
2010-11-23T09:32:16  <antimatroid1> it's not quite that simple, the moves you make can make it safe to make another
2010-11-23T09:32:21  <medrimonia> after you have just that, you can take the planet if dest._num_ships-av_distance*(5+dest._growth_rate)<0
2010-11-23T09:32:30  <antimatroid1> i let my game tree work out most of my decisions, i just feed it moves
2010-11-23T09:32:44  <antimatroid1> i try not to feed it bad moves
2010-11-23T09:32:51  <bhasker> hmm
2010-11-23T09:33:08  <medrimonia> With that, you're really sure that you can't get snipped
2010-11-23T09:33:20  <bhasker> if his minlen is 10
2010-11-23T09:33:24  <bhasker> and yours is 5
2010-11-23T09:33:27  <antimatroid1> i do a sweep at the start of each move to cancel out any of their attacks i can, then run my game tree, make the moves that picks then work out redistribtuion
2010-11-23T09:33:28  <bhasker> then av_distance is 5
2010-11-23T09:33:36  <bhasker> and if it cost 25 ships
2010-11-23T09:34:01  <medrimonia> you'll 25 ships more than can arrives from your home planet at time
2010-11-23T09:34:16  <bhasker> is the 5 in the formula
2010-11-23T09:34:18  <medrimonia> So even if the growth_rate is 0, you can't be sniped
2010-11-23T09:34:24  <bhasker> the growth from home planet?
2010-11-23T09:34:26  <antimatroid1> do you guys clear your tree at the start or end of the turn?
2010-11-23T09:34:29  <bhasker> rather your first planet
2010-11-23T09:34:32  <medrimonia> yep the five it's home planet growth
2010-11-23T09:34:45  <antimatroid1> i had issues with that taking a while to delete all the nodes, so i've got it deleting it at the start of each turn
2010-11-23T09:34:54  <antimatroid1> it also means i get to spend more time on the first turn than all others
2010-11-23T09:35:30  <phreeza> whos running the GA bots on benzedrine, any idea?
2010-11-23T09:35:38  <antimatroid1> would it be space invaders?
2010-11-23T09:35:51  <antimatroid1> i would expect GP though
2010-11-23T09:36:07  <antimatroid1> and i think he said he doesn't use tcp
2010-11-23T09:36:32  <medrimonia> The harder isn't to know which planet you can attack, but really to know how much ships you have to keep for being able to intercept the opponent if he attacks a planet which is snippable at the first turn
2010-11-23T09:36:50  <Mistmanov> phreeze: iirc boegel is running them
2010-11-23T09:36:51  <antimatroid1> my game tree deals with taht
2010-11-23T09:36:54  <phreeza> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1153571 this guy
2010-11-23T09:37:01  <medrimonia> I'm not still perfect on that yet, but I think that first turn is my best move
2010-11-23T09:37:03  <Mistmanov> yesterday someone talked about it here, you might try checking the logs
2010-11-23T09:37:36  <antimatroid1> pretty much my whole strategy is in the logs
2010-11-23T09:38:19  <Mistmanov> yeah it's a bit new for me that a "chatssesion" is basically being saved and indexed to be googled for eternity
2010-11-23T09:38:21  <Mistmanov> oh wlel :p
2010-11-23T09:38:35  <antimatroid1> erm

2010-11-23T09:39:18  <medrimonia> Yes he had play something like two weeks with two accounts
2010-11-23T09:39:38  <antimatroid1> i don't care, but the second account should probably be disabled
2010-11-23T09:39:55  <medrimonia> Yep
2010-11-23T09:40:44  <phreeza> Mistmanov: hehe found it, thanks
2010-11-23T09:40:51  <bhasker> isnt it sad that mega1 hasn't even submitted a new version since 19th nov
2010-11-23T09:40:55  <bhasker> and its still ruling
2010-11-23T09:40:57  <bhasker> :*(
2010-11-23T09:41:57  <bhasker> does anyone have a patch to make the html visualizer read a log file
2010-11-23T09:42:00  <bhasker> and show it turn by tunr
2010-11-23T09:42:07  <bhasker> i know iamluck has a fancy one
2010-11-23T09:42:28  <antimatroid1> somebody had the most awesome logging
2010-11-23T09:42:35  <antimatroid1> it was like ascii maps
2010-11-23T09:42:49  <bhasker> this is iamluck's http://spz.nofate.com/planetwars/debug2.png
2010-11-23T09:42:52  <bhasker> its pretty slick
2010-11-23T09:43:02  <antimatroid1> i could debug game trees with tron
2010-11-23T09:43:06  <antimatroid1> not a hope in hell with this
2010-11-23T09:43:16  <antimatroid1> running the numbers on small examples is hard enough
2010-11-23T09:44:42  <bhasker> its surprising that my 0.23 version is still holding at rank 50
2010-11-23T09:45:01  <bhasker> its practically the same ersion since Nov 8th or so with minor bug fixes
2010-11-23T09:45:17  <boegel> phreeza: that'd me :)
2010-11-23T09:45:19  <antimatroid1> i haven't had a bot on the main site since before that :|
2010-11-23T09:45:24  <boegel> phreeza: complaints? :P
2010-11-23T09:45:32  <antimatroid1> i hope i don't have issues when i finally upload, i will do with more than a day left though
2010-11-23T09:45:37  <phreeza> no :) i think its cool you're trying that
2010-11-23T09:45:56  <phreeza> my question was if its fine tuning parameters or making a strategy from scratch
2010-11-23T09:45:58  <boegel> it's not turning out too well for now
2010-11-23T09:46:03  <boegel> but I'm still working on it
2010-11-23T09:46:04  <phreeza> the logs answered that for me
2010-11-23T09:46:09  <phreeza> :)
2010-11-23T09:46:10  <boegel> phreeza: they did?
2010-11-23T09:46:27  <boegel> phreeza: howso?
2010-11-23T09:46:33  <phreeza> 2010-11-21T15:40:58  <boegel> Error323: I'm trying to finetune different thresholds, and enable/disable certain substrategies
2010-11-23T09:47:12  <phreeza> or did i misunderstand that?
2010-11-23T09:47:33  <boegel> phreeza: ah, you mean IRC logs
2010-11-23T09:47:39  <phreeza> yea
2010-11-23T09:47:42  <boegel> phreeza: no, you're right
2010-11-23T09:47:43  <phreeza> not game logs
2010-11-23T09:47:52  <boegel> phreeza: yeah, that confused me :)
2010-11-23T09:47:53  <phreeza> i'm not that good
2010-11-23T09:47:56  <phreeza> :)
2010-11-23T09:47:57  <antimatroid1> haha
2010-11-23T09:48:09  <antimatroid1> that would be creepy
2010-11-23T09:48:17  <boegel> phreeza: maybe you noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the bots being generated
2010-11-23T09:48:26  <boegel> phreeza: I haven't checked the results, will do that tonight
2010-11-23T09:48:44  <phreeza> i think they are improving for sure, gradually
2010-11-23T09:48:44  <bhasker> would have own this
2010-11-23T09:48:45  <bhasker> http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1164330
2010-11-23T09:49:27  <bhasker> except i issued an invalid order
2010-11-23T09:49:28  <bhasker> !@#!#!@#
2010-11-23T09:49:45  <boegel> phreeza: yeah, but my current GA settings aren't good
2010-11-23T09:49:58  <boegel> phreeza: too strict, even decent bots don't get past the 5-game limit
2010-11-23T09:50:02  <boegel> phreeza: they should though
2010-11-23T09:50:10  <phreeza> aha i noticed that
2010-11-23T09:50:15  <boegel> phreeza: I'll restart the GA with better settings when I get home
2010-11-23T09:50:20  <phreeza> the top ranking one only got 5 plays
2010-11-23T09:50:31  <boegel> yeah, because it lost a game :)
2010-11-23T09:50:38  <phreeza> do you use ELO for fitness or something else?
2010-11-23T09:50:41  <phreeza> ah hehe
2010-11-23T09:50:57  <boegel> the only way in which the #games will be bumped up will be when a bot wins 5 games in a row
2010-11-23T09:51:06  <boegel> and so far, that hasn't happened yet
2010-11-23T09:51:13  <boegel> I should lower that treshold
2010-11-23T09:51:15  <phreeza> alright
2010-11-23T09:51:22  <boegel> winning 3/5 should be enough to start
2010-11-23T09:51:29  <boegel> and them bump it up to 10 games
2010-11-23T09:51:49  <boegel> I'm running a GA locally tom against my own old bots
2010-11-23T09:52:03  <boegel> soI'm gradually figuring out better GA configs\
2010-11-23T09:53:21  <Error323> Oh man I just <3 git's cherrypick function
2010-11-23T09:53:53  <bhasker> well just making my bot not overextend itself fixed my losses to flavor

2010-11-23T13:22:19  <Mistmanov> yeah I just noticed

2010-11-23T13:22:24  <bhasker> rebel just replied to your mail
2010-11-23T13:22:33  <bhasker> yea well ebu was running like a 100 bots
2010-11-23T13:22:52  <bhasker> 84 bots to be precise
2010-11-23T13:23:04  <medrimonia2> yes between him and the other people, I think that's a little bit too much for the server
2010-11-23T13:23:07  <bhasker> i am not sure how he is managing that though
2010-11-23T13:23:17  <bhasker> hired an s3 instance or something
2010-11-23T13:23:22  <medrimonia2> And that changes a lot the ELO points
2010-11-23T13:23:23  <rebelxt> woah, he's got to stop 80 or so of his bots ;-)
2010-11-23T13:23:26  <bhasker> my dual core laptop can barely run two these instances
2010-11-23T13:23:34  <Mistmanov> using a server farm from his university?
2010-11-23T13:23:36  <bhasker> two or three:-\
2010-11-23T13:23:38  <bhasker> probably
2010-11-23T13:23:59  <Mistmanov> I wish I had access to my universities servers -_-
2010-11-23T13:25:12  <bhasker> not sure i can really make sense of 80 versions of my bot running
2010-11-23T13:25:37  <bhasker> unless he just wants to pick the best rated bot
2010-11-23T13:25:40  <bhasker> and submit it
2010-11-23T13:25:47  <rebelxt> yeah, it's just waste of resources.. some people might be tuning permutations of different parameter values, but that's not the best way to get improvements..
2010-11-23T13:26:25  <rebelxt> did anyone message him to stop this?

2010-11-23T13:28:13  <Mistmanov> currently only 42 connectinos?
2010-11-23T13:28:47  <rebelxt> bhasker: having tested on new map set, it seems i need to roll back to my week-old bot ;-) your bot kicks ass on this set
2010-11-23T13:28:49  <bhasker> he probably stopped
2010-11-23T13:28:59  <bhasker> yea i saw your mail
2010-11-23T13:29:06  <bhasker> so what is different about the new map set?
2010-11-23T13:29:12  <bhasker> what parameters changed?
2010-11-23T13:29:47  <rebelxt> i'm trying to figure out - just started game by game analysis. it's not obvious.. but it seems like mapgen was not altered at all. very weird...
2010-11-23T13:30:03  <bhasker> hmm that would be weird
2010-11-23T13:30:20  <bhasker> if generating new maps from same generator changes win/loss ratio that much
2010-11-23T13:30:33  <janzert> if new means the ones from yesterday, then yes they are the exact same generator as the ones from last wednesday
2010-11-23T13:30:35  <Error323> it's frightning
2010-11-23T13:30:58  <janzert> sounds like you overfit to the previous set?
2010-11-23T13:31:08  <rebelxt> janzert: thanks for confirming. i guess my current bot had a crush on previous set (r538) but not this new one
2010-11-23T13:31:55  <rebelxt> well, i did not do any tuning specific to r538, but r538a did change relative strength of my bots significantly. working on figuring this out now
2010-11-23T13:33:30  <janzert> first place I'd look is at your performance on maps with higher numbers of planets, since I think that's where the major variance occurred from looking at the rough stats on the maps. Although of course it may be something else entirely in the details

2010-11-23T13:37:09  <rebelxt> performance can't be a factor with my current bot. i'm thinking of generating 300+ maps for local testing to try and fight variance
2010-11-23T13:37:17  <bhasker> ebu was that you spamming tcp with 80 versions of your bot ?
2010-11-23T13:42:40  <janzert> rebelxt: I meant performance as in won/loss ratio
2010-11-23T13:44:56  <rebelxt> janzert: ahh got it. do you have average planet count  stats for both r538 and r538a handy? if not, i can calc it quickly
2010-11-23T13:46:43  <rebelxt> r538a does have higher number of planets on average, but only 3% higher
2010-11-23T13:47:25  <janzert> rebelxt: Mcleopold posted some in here yesterday if you check the logs
2010-11-23T13:47:34  <rebelxt> i'll keep digging.. if anyone can run a local test using bot r538 and r538a map sets, i'd be curious to see the results
2010-11-23T13:47:37  <rebelxt> janzert: ok thanks
2010-11-23T13:47:49  <janzert> I think the median is actually even higher
2010-11-23T13:48:12  <janzert> so probably fairly few low planet number maps
2010-11-23T13:48:22  <janzert> so if you do good on those you'll be hurting more
2010-11-23T13:52:49  <rebelxt> found the stats - good stuff.

2010-11-23T13:54:03  <rebelxt> eburnette: how many instances? we are getting time-outs possibly due to server overload
2010-11-23T13:54:04  <lavalamp_> tcp was completely unusable this morning
2010-11-23T13:55:06  <eburnette> Off and on for last 2 hours. I can control the number if something is overloading.
2010-11-23T13:55:13  <rebelxt> eburnette: i can let you run as many instances as you want against my tcp server (also on amazon EC2) so that we can keep benz in better shape
2010-11-23T13:56:10  <eburnette> I wish there was a way to make it wait for other players so I wouldn't play myself - that's not as useful
2010-11-23T13:56:25  <eburnette> I can play myself locally; on tcp I want to play others
2010-11-23T13:57:22  <lavalamp_> tcp should do an ip check, both so you don't play yourself and so it can limit everyone to 4 or so instances
2010-11-23T13:57:32  <rebelxt> eburnette: understood. would be nice if all of us limit # of instances to 5 or below. otherwise none of us gets good data on which bot is stonger....
2010-11-23T13:57:39  <Mistmanov> If you're connecting with something like 80 bots, and there are only 40 other players... there's a big chance you're going to play yourself. That, or all the other players will be forcd to play against you
2010-11-23T13:57:45  <lavalamp_> actually playing yourself might be necessary for the ratings to be accurate
2010-11-23T13:58:27  <rebelxt> eburnette: best approach is probably running a local tournament to find 2-5 strongest bots, and then putting them on TCP to determine the winner...
2010-11-23T13:58:53  <eburnette> I have it throttled down now, otherwise I'd be doing 1000 connections :)
2010-11-23T13:59:46  <eburnette> It looks like the server does throttling because I never see simultaneous games go over about 40
2010-11-23T14:00:35  <eburnette> So what do you guys think about the new map generator posted this morning? Quite a change ey?

2010-11-23T14:43:06  <bhasker> this one is mostly maximizing my current moves
2010-11-23T14:43:17  <bhasker> it still uses heuristics
2010-11-23T14:43:35  <bhasker> to prune stupid stuff like trying to acquire a neutral right next to an enemy one
2010-11-23T14:43:46  <bhasker> which may look very attractive in terms of an eval function
2010-11-23T14:43:55  <bhasker> but probability of holding that is probably very low
2010-11-23T14:44:14  <bhasker> so it just walks through the planet list and makes a list of moves that i can make
2010-11-23T14:44:18  <bhasker> then scores each one
2010-11-23T14:44:25  <bhasker> actually doesn't score each one
2010-11-23T14:44:30  <bhasker> first it sees which combinations are possible
2010-11-23T14:44:41  <bhasker> and then scores all the individual moves and the combinations
2010-11-23T14:44:54  <bhasker> and then executes the move with the highest score
2010-11-23T14:45:00  <bhasker> which can be a single move or a combination
2010-11-23T14:45:13  <bhasker> and i basically have some leeway in my eval
2010-11-23T14:45:46  <bhasker>         if enemy_value < enemy_current_value*1.1 and my_value>my_current_value*0.95:
2010-11-23T14:45:55  <bhasker> it only adds orders that fall into that category
2010-11-23T14:46:34  <bhasker> if i do a strict > < then it sometimes gets too restrictive
2010-11-23T14:46:50  <bhasker> so it basically prefers moves that lower enemies value without lowering mine by too much

2010-11-23T15:13:26  <eburnette> I'm liking combo moves less and less. When your planned move in the future can't be done, it leaves you in a weakened state (like you only sent half what is necessary to take a neutral)
2010-11-23T15:13:52  <eburnette> Anybody find a way around that?

2010-11-23T15:15:52  <rebelxt> eburnette, this happens to me as well. however if a scheduled move has to be cancelled, i can normally help attack from other planets.. i.e. i don't attack neutrals if i can't guarantee getting it captured
2010-11-23T15:17:28  <eburnette> hmm, I wonder if attacking with more than needed would achieve the same effect, say enough for any one launch to be cancelled.

2010-11-23T18:41:51  <j3camero> space.invaders has made a bot that evolves using GP!
2010-11-23T18:42:01  <j3camero> Finally! I was wondering when this was going to happen!
2010-11-23T18:43:51  <Marco_L> that is a nice approach, but they still feed in the parameters themselves.
2010-11-23T18:44:24  <Marco_L> for example the program did not find out that 'future owner of a planet' is useful information by itself
2010-11-23T18:44:47  <j3camero> Still, it's so cool.
2010-11-23T18:46:13  <Marco_L> their bot is already better than my submission ^^
2010-11-23T18:48:38  <j3camero> That just blows me away.
2010-11-23T18:48:46  <j3camero> I am trying to submit this to Reddit. I need a good title.
2010-11-23T18:48:58  <jmcarthur> i'm surprised at how intelligent that bot seems
2010-11-23T18:49:49  <j3camero> I want to use the words "Self Improving" "Google AI Challenge" and "Genetic Programming"

2010-11-23T18:53:02  <j3camero> The end is near. Austrian team uses Genetic Programming to create a self-improving game playing program. It is currently ahead of 95% of hand-coded submissions in the Google AI Challenge.

2010-11-23T19:03:32  <j3camero> Yes! yeeeesss! From page of r/programming. That's the shit.
2010-11-23T19:04:07  <flag> I thought that was boscimacko's for a second
2010-11-23T19:04:48  <flag> I confused "beating 95% of participants" and "winning 95% of games"
2010-11-23T19:05:17  <j3camero> aha yeah big difference
2010-11-23T19:06:56  <Naktibalda> loosing to 5% of participants is a lot :)

2010-11-23T19:08:34  <bhasker> the beauty is once you write it, you just let it run i guess ^
2010-11-23T19:08:39  <bhasker> no tuning
2010-11-23T19:08:42  <bhasker> that would be nice
2010-11-23T19:09:17  <flag> Well you might have to change it to adapt better

2010-11-23T19:40:40  <pgpaskar> Google search is AMAZING
2010-11-23T19:40:48  <pgpaskar> chrome history search is poop
2010-11-23T19:40:51  <pgpaskar> Why :'(
2010-11-23T19:44:53  <Error323> lol
2010-11-23T19:45:03  <Error323> google is big
2010-11-23T19:45:17  <Error323> and chrome is immature
2010-11-23T19:45:18  <Error323> =)
2010-11-23T19:47:43  <j3camero> Chrome history search is fine. You just never go anywhere interesting on the internet.
2010-11-23T19:47:54  <j3camero> :-P

2010-11-23T19:53:58  <bhasker> e323 spun up my latest version of my max bot on zeroviz
2010-11-23T19:54:00  <bhasker> lets see how it does
2010-11-23T19:54:05  <Error323> cool
2010-11-23T19:54:12  <bhasker> though its not doing that great on tcp
2010-11-23T19:54:12  <Error323> i also may have a new version comming up
2010-11-23T19:54:14  <bhasker> still at 207 elo
2010-11-23T19:54:16  <bhasker> :-\
2010-11-23T19:54:25  <Error323> well tcp isn't always reliable :/
2010-11-23T19:54:31  <bhasker> its slowly climbing though
2010-11-23T19:54:34  <bhasker> slow and steady
2010-11-23T19:54:39  <Error323> you need offline tests
2010-11-23T19:54:46  <Error323> against several varieing bots
2010-11-23T19:54:55  <Error323> that's most reliablei mo
2010-11-23T19:55:00  <bhasker> i see your bot is holding a nice 334
2010-11-23T19:55:11  <Error323> yes :)
2010-11-23T19:55:29  <Error323> ripped out the synchronized neutral capping again
2010-11-23T19:55:36  <Error323> because it was performing much worse
2010-11-23T19:55:41  <Error323> and made some improvements

2010-11-23T19:55:44  <Error323> using offline data
2010-11-23T19:55:46  <bhasker> ah
2010-11-23T19:56:26  <Error323> my bot has a very different approach in neutral capping and enemy attacking it seems
2010-11-23T19:56:41  <Error323> i doubt if syncronized eenemy capture will be an improvement
2010-11-23T19:56:55  <Error323> its hard to forsee these type of changes
2010-11-23T19:57:01  <Error323> and their effects
2010-11-23T19:57:05  <bhasker> true
2010-11-23T19:58:03  <bhasker> i think there is advantage in synchronized enemy attack
2010-11-23T19:58:04  <lavalamp_> @tcp
2010-11-23T19:58:05  <contestbot> lavalamp_: tcp = (#1) http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/, or (#2) http://72.44.46.68/, or (#3) 98.247.248.39:995 (zeroviz.us), or (#4) http://tcp.zeroviz.us/, or (#5) http://tcp2.zeroviz.us/ (crazy!)
2010-11-23T19:58:12  <bhasker> since it delays the reaction time for the enemy
2010-11-23T19:58:36  <lavalamp_> nah enemy knows what's coming as soon as you launch the first fleet
2010-11-23T19:58:42  <Error323> yes but it also assumes the same state over several turns
2010-11-23T19:58:44  <bhasker> no he doesn't
2010-11-23T19:58:48  <Error323> lavalamp_: untrue
2010-11-23T19:59:01  <lavalamp_> no?
2010-11-23T19:59:04  <Error323> however the assumption is what's tricky
2010-11-23T19:59:06  <bhasker> nope
2010-11-23T19:59:09  <lavalamp_> why not?
2010-11-23T19:59:20  <bhasker> cause my second fleet won't launch till i cross the planet boundary
2010-11-23T19:59:28  <bhasker> so lets say i have two planets at distance 9 and distance 5
2010-11-23T19:59:32  <bhasker> from your planet
2010-11-23T19:59:34  <lavalamp_> if you can do the math and know that you'll have those ships then, so can he
2010-11-23T19:59:34  <bhasker> i will launch from 9
2010-11-23T19:59:44  <bhasker> but i need not launch
2010-11-23T19:59:51  <bhasker> if you launch to prevent my future launch
2010-11-23T19:59:56  <bhasker> i can just change my order midway
2010-11-23T20:00:01  <Error323> because if I send e.g. 10 fleets from a distant planet to the enemy and then when they have reached the same distance as a closeby planet of mine which also sends 10 then, the reaction time of the enemy is much smaller
2010-11-23T20:00:11  <bhasker> ^ what he said
2010-11-23T20:00:33  <lavalamp_> but the enemy knows you have those ships on the closer planet
2010-11-23T20:00:45  <lavalamp_> he can do the math too...
2010-11-23T20:00:47  <bhasker> but how do you know where i intend to launch
2010-11-23T20:00:51  <Error323> lavalamp_: yes, but he doesn't know where they will be send
2010-11-23T20:00:56  <bhasker> or whether i intend to at all
2010-11-23T20:01:04  <Error323> i might also capture a neutral
2010-11-23T20:01:12  <Error323> and too defensive play will get you killed
2010-11-23T20:01:16  <bhasker> now if you try to send extra ships upfront i can just attack something else
2010-11-23T20:01:18  <lavalamp_> well, you just gave a big clue with the ships from across the board ^^
2010-11-23T20:01:43  <lavalamp_> well my bot already does syncronised launching, so... *shrug*
2010-11-23T20:01:45  <bhasker> yes but till i actually launch the last fleet you don't know if i will complete
2010-11-23T20:01:57  <Error323> indd
2010-11-23T20:02:12  <lavalamp_> damn all I get on tcp is timeouts
2010-11-23T20:02:16  <lavalamp_> what the hell
2010-11-23T20:02:44  <lavalamp_> how am I supposed to test anything?
2010-11-23T20:02:50  <lavalamp_> not that I have anything worth testing...
2010-11-23T20:03:22  <bhasker> E323 did you stop your bot on zeroviz?
2010-11-23T20:05:08  <Error323> mmmm yes

2010-11-23T22:17:08  <lavalamp_> maybe it's my problem
2010-11-23T22:17:13  <lavalamp_> hmmm
2010-11-23T22:17:27  <antimatroid1> i fixed my invalid orders issue
2010-11-23T22:17:33  <antimatroid1> but it still seems to crash on the odd game
2010-11-23T22:17:47  <antimatroid1> got error in 70 trns
2010-11-23T22:17:54  <lavalamp_> My defense calc code would have done the same as yours in that game
2010-11-23T22:18:01  <lavalamp_> except I couldn't get it working in time :(
2010-11-23T22:18:13  <antimatroid1> i don't have any defense code for saving moves atm
2010-11-23T22:18:19  <antimatroid1> i need to add that yet
2010-11-23T22:18:24  <lavalamp_> pure lookahead?
2010-11-23T22:18:27  <antimatroid1> and i haven't got fleets redirecting

2010-11-23T22:18:29  <antimatroid1> yeah
2010-11-23T22:18:45  <antimatroid1> it leaves fleets for incoming, but not for what they might send

2010-11-23T22:19:22  <lavalamp_> yeah getting the latter one working without crippling your bot is a bitch

2010-11-23T22:19:48  <lavalamp_> I thought I'd done it but it has a bug that counts defenders twice

2010-11-23T22:20:17  <burny> and I think the improvements I made the other day, makes it much more vulnerable to attacks
2010-11-23T22:20:39  <burny> so, not seeing any real improvements from it's performance, until I add some code ot make it defend itself
2010-11-23T22:22:36  <antimatroid1> my bot just played terribly against medrmonia

2010-11-23T22:29:47  <burny> or atleast.. do SOMEthing
2010-11-23T22:31:02  <lavalamp_> ok, changed my timeout value... let's see if I still have troube

2010-11-23T22:33:26  <antimatroid1> nah that was alright
2010-11-23T22:33:47  <antimatroid1> taking the neutral at the bottom was stupid
2010-11-23T22:35:52  <Prillicy> hmm, now my bot is crashing when it wins...

2010-11-23T22:36:44  <Prillicy> gotta figure out why....not even showing an error
2010-11-23T22:38:41  <antimatroid1> i have no idea what's causing my bot to sometimes crash
2010-11-23T22:38:44  <antimatroid1> trying to work that out now
2010-11-23T22:38:53  <burny> not having a target?
2010-11-23T22:39:06  <antimatroid1> i should be accounting for that
2010-11-23T22:42:48  <lavalamp_> grrrr on zeroviz it times out before I win

2010-11-23T23:33:40  <bhasker> maybe mine is stable because i haven't been uploading much

2010-11-23T23:38:44  <davidjliu> better not pout
2010-11-23T23:38:47  <antimatroid1> lies
2010-11-23T23:38:48  <davidjliu> I'm telling you why

2010-11-23T23:41:18  <eburnette> I thought about doing some deep thinking bot that only ran over tcp on it, 1600 cores ought to be able to search a bunch of plys
2010-11-23T23:41:59  <lavalamp__> grrr and I was totally going to win: http://72.44.46.68/canvas?game_id=1177381

2010-11-23T23:42:26  <lavalamp__> oh wait maybe not
2010-11-23T23:42:34  <antimatroid1> and if so, are you deleting it at the start or end of each turn?
2010-11-23T23:42:40  <eburnette> why did it stop on move 187?
2010-11-23T23:42:42  <lavalamp__> no :(
2010-11-23T23:42:42  <lavalamp__> not in this one
2010-11-23T23:42:43  <rebelxt_> 1600?! still need very strong pruning though. but mega1's bot would probably kill everything on earth given 1600 cores! ;-)
2010-11-23T23:42:45  <lavalamp__> I have one
2010-11-23T23:42:53  <lavalamp__> I should turn it on and see how it does
2010-11-23T23:43:22  *** lavalamp__ is now known as lavalamp_
2010-11-23T23:43:46  <eburnette> mega1's bot runs in almost constant time from what I understand, only does 2 plys (ply=move from 1 player)
2010-11-23T23:44:28  <rebelxt_> i don't get how High CPU EC2 instances are still slower than my laptop's 1.7 GHz low voltage CPU. virtualization FTL sometimes
2010-11-23T23:45:11  <eburnette> EC2 is kind of slow, but scalability makes up for it eventually
2010-11-23T23:45:29  <eburnette> Hey, check out the leader board at http://72.44.46.68/getratings
2010-11-23T23:45:34  <bhasker> i don't think mega1 does 2 plys
2010-11-23T23:45:36  <bhasker> he said 1?
2010-11-23T23:46:01  <davidjliu> I mean, I think what he said as "1 ply" probably meant 1 ply for each player

2010-11-23T23:46:28  <lavalamp_> antimatroid1, I can't run my treebot right now, it's broken in the branch I'm working in atm...
2010-11-23T23:46:31  <rebelxt_> eburnette: cool, holding 1st is tough though ;-)
2010-11-23T23:46:48  <bhasker> i wish my code was easy to do 1 ply per person

2010-11-23T23:47:01  <bhasker> i will have to do major surgery to make it do 1 ply
2010-11-23T23:47:04  <bhasker> per person
2010-11-23T23:48:44  <rebelxt_> yeah.. i thought scheduled flights were hard to handle but tree search was a complete re-write
2010-11-23T23:50:22  <eburnette> I'm doing alpha-beta with iterative deepening. But I think the hardest part for me was getting the stupid game state right (ship counts, not making illegal moves, etc.)
2010-11-23T23:50:50  <rebelxt_> Error323_: is this ur official submission running on zeroviz?
2010-11-23T23:52:29  <davidjliu> eburnette: why did you stop sending ships at the end:
2010-11-23T23:52:30  <davidjliu> http://zeroviz.us:8080/canvas.cgi?game_id=21863
2010-11-23T23:52:38  <rebelxt_> eburnette: good luck with that. i got pwned by complexity and jumped back into heuristic world
2010-11-23T23:52:52  <davidjliu> urg, my bot is dying...
2010-11-23T23:53:02  <eburnette> nice move rebelxt_ on that zeroviz game with charmeleon
2010-11-23T23:53:50  <eburnette> davidjliu um, who one that game?
2010-11-23T23:53:57  <eburnette> won
2010-11-23T23:54:46  <davidjliu> apparently I did
2010-11-23T23:55:03  <davidjliu> because I captured your planet on the second last turn, and won on the growth from that
2010-11-23T23:55:18  <rebelxt_> eburnette: was a gg

2010-11-23T23:56:38  <bhasker> beating on santaclaus
2010-11-23T23:56:40  <eburnette> must be a bug with my 200th move logic
2010-11-23T23:57:33  <davidjliu> like, over half my losses are in games that go to 200 moves
2010-11-23T23:57:42  <davidjliu> and the one against Pichu should've been a loss too
