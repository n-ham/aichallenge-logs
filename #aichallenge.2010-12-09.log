2010-12-09T05:50:29  <mega1> I dislike battlecode more and more as I read last year's spec.
2010-12-09T05:51:03  <mega1> using finally incurs a penalty?!
2010-12-09T05:51:28  <mega1> there is no way to conditionally execute something on the current turn
2010-12-09T05:51:48  <mega1> like compare-and-swap: do this if turn is T
2010-12-09T05:52:15  <mega1> except they throw and exception if the order cannot be executed
2010-12-09T05:52:27  <mega1> of course you get a penalty for exceptions ...
2010-12-09T05:52:42  <sigh> what all the penalties? o_O
2010-12-09T05:52:45  <sigh> *why
2010-12-09T05:53:11  <mega1> must be because of how they actually execute the bots
2010-12-09T05:54:03  <mega1> I don't really know.
2010-12-09T05:54:07  <sigh> :(
2010-12-09T05:54:30  <antimatroid1> that's one of the things this contest gets right
2010-12-09T05:54:36  <mega1> using yield() (to end the turn) is encouraged
2010-12-09T05:54:37  <antimatroid1> people can almost use anything they want
2010-12-09T05:54:56  <mega1> ... but you can hardly be sure which turn you ended
2010-12-09T05:55:14  <mega1> unless you also count byte code usage.
2010-12-09T05:55:50  <mega1> maybe that's the intention.
2010-12-09T05:57:22  <sigh> yeah, the way they explain that confuses me a bit, too
2010-12-09T05:58:30  <sigh> woah, 500 bytecode penalty out of 6000 per-round limit
2010-12-09T05:58:35  <mega1> ah, but you cannot know for which turn Clock.getByteCodeNum() returns what it returns ...
2010-12-09T05:59:27  <sigh> huh? wouldn't it just count from the previous yield()?

2010-12-09T06:00:10  <mega1> sigh: no, another round might have finished in the meantime
2010-12-09T06:00:20  <mega1> yield() just ends the turn early.
2010-12-09T06:00:21  <sigh> oh, yeah... I see
2010-12-09T06:00:48  <sigh> so you can't actually tell what turn you are on?
2010-12-09T06:01:06  <mega1> well, you can almost be sure I guess
2010-12-09T06:01:15  <antimatroid1> ^^ that sounds horribl
2010-12-09T06:01:16  <antimatroid1> e
2010-12-09T06:01:32  <mega1> call Clock.getRoundNum() and Clock.getByteCodeNum()
2010-12-09T06:02:41  <sigh> ah, they have a getRoundNum() method
2010-12-09T06:03:14  <antimatroid1> you guys would know this better than me, if bots are fed the state incrementally (so given a full second each), is it possible to ensure that one bot doesn't do anything on the cpu in it's "off" time?
2010-12-09T06:03:16  <mega1> one must be clever about comparing bytecodenum and the number of bytecodes it takes to the the test ...
2010-12-09T06:03:59  <sigh> antimatroid1: for battlecode? battlecode doesn't use time
2010-12-09T06:04:14  <sigh> it uses count of bytecodes executed
2010-12-09T06:05:41  <antimatroid1> sigh: no i mean for this contest
2010-12-09T06:05:43  <antimatroid1> http://www.ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1218
2010-12-09T06:05:58  <antimatroid1> see there for context, the last post is the relevant part
2010-12-09T06:06:34  <antimatroid1> like, when both waits are run, can it be like
2010-12-09T06:06:34  <antimatroid1> feed info to bot 1 while bot 2 is in some wait function, etc.
2010-12-09T06:06:35  <mega1> if they have their own process then "kill -STOP" should do it
2010-12-09T06:06:43  <mega1> then kill -CONT
2010-12-09T06:07:15  <antimatroid1> i take it you both agree that bots should get a full second to themselves?
2010-12-09T06:07:28  <antimatroid1> or whatever the turn limit is, i'd rather they half if and guaranteed me always a half
2010-12-09T06:07:34  <antimatroid1> halve*
2010-12-09T06:08:05  <sigh> sure that's reasonable
2010-12-09T06:08:06  <mega1> yes, cpu time
2010-12-09T06:08:30  <sigh> but if multiple games are running, then they won't *really* have the cpu to themselves :P
2010-12-09T06:08:44  <antimatroid1> my point is i want to restrict that :P
2010-12-09T06:08:48  <antimatroid1> one game per core
2010-12-09T06:08:57  <sigh> fair enough
2010-12-09T06:09:12  <antimatroid1> it's currently 2 games per server at a time, with 2 cores per server
2010-12-09T06:09:14  <mega1> you can run more than one if cpu time is measured, no?
2010-12-09T06:09:41  * antimatroid1 has no idea about this stuff, i really shouldn't be the one to work it out, but if no one else does...
2010-12-09T06:09:58  <sigh> yeah, I haven't had to micro-manage time like this before, either
2010-12-09T06:11:30  <mega1> the reason for using wall clock could have been lack of language support for cpu time based timeouts
2010-12-09T06:12:10  <mega1> if that's the case then STOP/CONT can still work if given a separate core.
2010-12-09T06:13:25  <sigh> mega1: how does the engine monitor cpu time of the players?
2010-12-09T06:13:59  <antimatroid1> i don't think the engine should rely on the machine having two cores
2010-12-09T06:14:16  <antimatroid1> it'd certainly make testing a lot harder for me
2010-12-09T06:14:41  <mega1> sigh: maybe getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN) ... if they don't run at the same time

2010-12-09T06:15:16  <antimatroid1> i understand wall clock
2010-12-09T06:15:20  <mega1> because it only takes into account terminated children

2010-12-09T06:16:17  <mega1> maybe linux process accounting is fine grained enough.
2010-12-09T06:16:25  <sigh> antimatroid1: how much time the CPU spent processing instructions for your program :P
2010-12-09T06:16:47  <antimatroid1> well derrr :P, i want that one
2010-12-09T06:16:50  <sigh> mega1: ah cool, didn't know there were functions like that
2010-12-09T06:17:31  <mega1> but as I said above getrusage doesn't help us here.
2010-12-09T06:18:23  <sigh> ah "terminated and waited-for children" ojnly
2010-12-09T06:18:31  <mega1> yes
2010-12-09T06:19:17  <mega1> even if linux process accounting works it's problematic because it's linux specific
2010-12-09T06:19:19  <antimatroid1> i think starter packages should come with timers too where possible
2010-12-09T06:19:32  <mega1> and people want the engine to run on all kinds of OSes.
2010-12-09T06:21:18  <mega1> STOP/CONT is posix, another solution is needed for windows
2010-12-09T06:21:30  <dmj111> this is a hack, but the engine I wrote to do my own testing had a --serial option because my machine only has one core.
2010-12-09T06:21:45  <sigh> other OSs aren't as much of a problem, I think... it doesn't need to be completely accurate if it is not the main contest
2010-12-09T06:22:05  <antimatroid1> it has to at least work though? how far off would it be?
2010-12-09T06:22:07  <mega1> dmj111: did you enforce that the inactive bot actually does nothing?
2010-12-09T06:22:40  <mega1> that's what STOP/CONT should accomplish.
2010-12-09T06:23:37  <sigh> STOP can't be caught, right?
2010-12-09T06:24:00  <dmj111> mega1: I see now.....  it was cooperative, so I did nothing :)
2010-12-09T06:24:21  <mega1> sigh: right
2010-12-09T06:24:41  <sigh> thought so, that would be a very silly loophole :P
2010-12-09T06:25:06  <antimatroid1> yeah, i don't think people have really bothered with that kind of stuff so far, but ideally it shouldn't be possible
2010-12-09T06:26:26  <sigh> well, even wall-clock with STOP/CONT would be at least as good as what happened in this contest
2010-12-09T06:27:28  <antimatroid1> yep, i don't like how it's done now at all
2010-12-09T06:29:39  <antimatroid1> what about a kind of multiplayer cellular automata game? start with symmetric maps, then allow players to place up to x squares of their colour each turn that are blank, then iterate with the set rules?
2010-12-09T06:29:59  <antimatroid1> i guess that's a fairly obvious minimax game

2010-12-09T22:53:15  <antimatroid1> sigh: http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/wikileaks/wikileaks-acts-illegal-gillard-government/story-fn775xjq-1225968584365
2010-12-09T22:53:18  <antimatroid1> WTF!!!!
2010-12-09T22:53:24  <antimatroid1> someone does something illegal before wikileaks get files, so they have participated in something illegal, someone does something illegal before our newspapers get them, so they haven't participated in something illegal?
2010-12-09T22:53:55  <antimatroid1> i can't believe they openly said that
2010-12-09T22:54:04  <sigh> yeah, she's full of shit
2010-12-09T22:55:55  <antimatroid1> but seriously, that argument above is just plain bat shit retarded
2010-12-09T22:56:32  <sigh> yeah well, that's not exactly a surprise
2010-12-09T22:56:41  <antimatroid1> if wikileaks have done something illegal by releasing the files, then one cannot argue our newspapers haven't broken the same laws
2010-12-09T22:57:44  <sigh> freedom of the press laws are convoluted and stupid, i'm not going to pretend to understand them
2010-12-09T22:59:13  <antimatroid1> sure, i debate on what should be the case :)
2010-12-09T22:59:20  <antimatroid1> i don't have any idea of how the actual law works
2010-12-09T22:59:43  <sigh> :P
2010-12-09T22:59:44  <antimatroid1> it's often hard to convince people to talk to me in terms of what is right and wrong rather than legal and not legal, discrimination particularly

2010-12-09T23:04:06  <epona> if something is considered a news source, it legally can't be touched. if someone does something illegal to obtain the information, the hacker is at fault, NOT the news source
2010-12-09T23:05:11  <burny> they are if they know/suspect it's illegal

2010-12-09T23:05:32  <burny> or if jsut sharign the info is illegal
2010-12-09T23:06:00  <antimatroid1> epona: my point is Wikileaks is also not a source
2010-12-09T23:06:23  <antimatroid1> they simply release documents for other people, they are essentially a middle man
2010-12-09T23:06:41  <epona> hmm. seems like a news source to me.
2010-12-09T23:06:46  <antimatroid1> which I see as no different to our local newspapers publishing the same information
2010-12-09T23:06:57  <antimatroid1> our government is saying Wikileaks acts are illegal, but our newspapers acts aren't
2010-12-09T23:07:13  <antimatroid1> which I can't see being logical in any way, but then, the law often isn't logical if you ask me
2010-12-09T23:07:34  <epona> especially when corporations are involved
2010-12-09T23:08:27  <antimatroid1> I'm not up to date on how people define journalism, but quite a few people do consider the work of Wikileaks to fall under it, and they won an international journalism award earlier this year
