2012-01-24T09:41:57  <pairofdice> Hihi
2012-01-24T09:46:41  <UncleVasya> I had exams and gone from here because of that. Passed them very well :)
2012-01-24T09:50:15  <mcstar> hey
2012-01-24T09:50:22  <mcstar> good to hear
2012-01-24T09:54:43  <UncleVasya> Now I'm going to home (where I don't have a computer) for a week. By 'now' I mean I'm already in a bus and typing from phone.
2012-01-24T09:55:01  <thestinger> meh, solved my first euler problem in a week
2012-01-24T09:55:32  <UncleVasya> What's the state of the Asteroids project?
2012-01-24T09:56:25  <mcstar> nothing new i think
2012-01-24T09:56:36  <UncleVasya> Sad.
2012-01-24T09:57:06  <thestinger> http://sprunge.us/LLfE probably a better way to do this
2012-01-24T09:57:18  <thestinger> also I really hate some of the operator overloads python uses
2012-01-24T09:57:38  <thestinger> {1,2,3} - {2,3} and {1,2,3} & {2,3,4} for set difference and intersection is wtf
2012-01-24T09:57:43  <thestinger> reminds me of C++
2012-01-24T09:58:03  <mcstar> you see? people seem to have misunderstood the purpose of this channel, now it is explicitely about vanity
2012-01-24T09:58:39  <thestinger> no :(, it's #random-other-programming-challenges
2012-01-24T09:59:10  <mcstar> i dont mean it...
2012-01-24T09:59:27  <thestinger> MrLeopold already pwned me at project euler anyway :P
2012-01-24T09:59:39  <thestinger> I was stuck on this problem for so long
2012-01-24T09:59:42  <mcstar> ~20 problems right?
2012-01-24T10:00:02  <thestinger> yeah
2012-01-24T10:00:16  <thestinger> I caught up to him by skipping around and doing easy ones
2012-01-24T10:00:17  <mcstar> thats max 3 days for you to overcome
2012-01-24T10:00:20  <mcstar> 2
2012-01-24T10:00:21  <mcstar> 2
2012-01-24T10:00:25  <thestinger> eventually he got to the big chain of easy ones...
2012-01-24T10:00:32  <thestinger> since he's basically doing them in order
2012-01-24T10:01:07  <mcstar> i stopped doing them altogether, have to read a lot of stuff, and im quite busy
2012-01-24T10:01:22  <thestinger> uni finals or something?
2012-01-24T10:02:06  <mcstar> well, or something
2012-01-24T10:02:41  <mcstar> im reading about human consciousness and similar issues

2012-01-24T10:09:27  <mcstar> at least thats my impression
2012-01-24T10:09:40  <mcstar> doesnt matter, i can do whatever they need me to do

2012-01-24T10:21:46  <mcstar> ah
2012-01-24T10:21:49  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-24T10:22:07  <mcstar> i cant blame them, time was an issue
2012-01-24T10:22:27  <mcstar> so they chose the more dependable one
2012-01-24T10:23:04  <antimatroid> have you had any other interviews?
2012-01-24T10:23:25  <mcstar> no
2012-01-24T10:23:38  <antimatroid> how about your other friend?
2012-01-24T10:23:42  <antimatroid> has he had any luck?
2012-01-24T10:24:20  <mcstar> he was asking for some english advice from me, for the motivational letter to BCG
2012-01-24T10:24:38  <mcstar> i dont know what has happened since then
2012-01-24T10:25:10  <mcstar> but im gonna meet these same guys next week
2012-01-24T10:25:44  <mcstar> (this firm i was talking about, since they seem to be interested in me otherwise)
2012-01-24T10:25:49  <antimatroid> yep
2012-01-24T10:25:56  <antimatroid> any idea what to do?
2012-01-24T10:26:30  <mcstar> maybe some other software? or some electrical engineering stuff?
2012-01-24T10:26:42  <mcstar> maybe something on the physics side?
2012-01-24T10:27:02  <mcstar> im not sure if they do modeling/simulations or just build things
2012-01-24T10:27:34  <mcstar> there can be a lot of possibilities
2012-01-24T10:28:32  <antimatroidl> yeah, either of those sound fun to me
2012-01-24T10:28:46  <antimatroidl> i'm still a bit skeptical of a place like bcg
2012-01-24T10:28:58  <antimatroidl> but a job is a job when needed
2012-01-24T10:29:11  <mcstar> :)
2012-01-24T10:29:21  <mcstar> i read the article and the replies
2012-01-24T10:29:46  <mcstar> (on another site the same article is linked, and there are many replies)
2012-01-24T10:29:48  <antimatroidl> i'm sure that's a bleak picture, but that;s the kind of thing i'd be worried about with such a company
2012-01-24T10:30:47  <antimatroidl> companies like google depend on their own work for generating money, and to some degree so do bcg with repeat customers etc. but it's not the same

2012-01-24T10:31:29  <mcstar> how much does google depend on advertising?
2012-01-24T10:31:29  <antimatroidl> what i like about a place like optiver is they don't have clients/customers to please or worry about
2012-01-24T10:32:01  <antimatroidl> yeah, but the people writing google ad stuff depend on them getting that "right" if that makes sense
2012-01-24T10:32:30  <antimatroidl> i'm overly fussy about what "i would" do
2012-01-24T10:32:51  <mcstar> well, google can offer the same deal to everyone
2012-01-24T10:32:52  <antimatroidl> in reality i've never had to properly join the real world, so i'm mostly speaking out of my ass :P
2012-01-24T10:33:05  <mcstar> a consulting company would need to offer different solutions to everyone
2012-01-24T10:33:43  <antimatroidl> sure, but some consulting firms do seem willing to say whatever you want them to say, see economic hitman for example
2012-01-24T10:33:57  <antimatroidl> that's an extreme example, but lots of consulting firms profited off wars
2012-01-24T10:34:39  <antimatroidl> which i don't mind so much about, unless they do so imorally, which i don't doubt has been done a lot
2012-01-24T10:37:00  <mcstar> i dont see how can war be moral
2012-01-24T10:37:23  <mcstar> hm, you probable mean peacekeeping?
2012-01-24T10:37:25  <mcstar> y
2012-01-24T10:37:33  <mcstar> :D
2012-01-24T10:38:52  <antimatroidl> i don't think a war can be moral, i think the actions of some people given the presence of a war can be moral
2012-01-24T10:39:11  <antimatroidl> even the military actions of a country if they're being invaded for example
2012-01-24T10:39:20  <antimatroidl> within reason
2012-01-24T10:39:54  <mcstar> hm, galois offers haskell courses
2012-01-24T10:40:17  <pairofdice> What is kell anyway
2012-01-24T10:40:26  <pairofdice> And why do so many people have it
2012-01-24T10:40:30  <mcstar> kell=have to
2012-01-24T10:40:39  <mcstar> in hungarian
2012-01-24T10:41:10  <mcstar> antimatroidl: galois.com is the kind of consulting id do with a clean conscience
2012-01-24T10:41:55  <mcstar> the more technological or specific a consulting company is, the more you can assume real work is done there
2012-01-24T10:42:04  <antimatroidl> yep
2012-01-24T10:42:22  <antimatroidl> and being mentally challenged is high on my priority list
2012-01-24T10:42:43  <mcstar> what?
2012-01-24T10:42:49  <antimatroidl> for a job
2012-01-24T10:42:53  <mcstar> XD
2012-01-24T10:43:07  <mcstar> out of context that sentence is wayy too funny
2012-01-24T10:43:16  <pairofdice> :D
2012-01-24T10:43:31  <pairofdice> Alcohol helps
2012-01-24T10:44:11  <antimatroidl> oh
2012-01-24T10:44:18  <antimatroidl> it's australia day tomorrow :D
2012-01-24T10:44:30  <pairofdice> Oi! Oi! Oi!
2012-01-24T10:44:33  <antimatroidl> i was a write off by midday last year, oops
2012-01-24T10:44:36  <mcstar> ah, i remember a House episode, there was this guy, who was a genius, but he wanted to love his wife, whom he couldnt stand sober, so he dulled his mind with alcohol
2012-01-24T10:44:50  <pairofdice> Isn't that most men?
2012-01-24T10:44:52  <antimatroidl> i think i remember that
2012-01-24T10:45:05  <mcstar> i dont know, im very bad with women
2012-01-24T10:45:06  * antimatroidl wouldn't know
2012-01-24T10:45:19  <antimatroidl> but i like to think there exist married/long term couples who aren't like that
2012-01-24T10:45:33  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-24T10:45:46  <pairofdice> I like to think that women are very bad with me
2012-01-24T10:45:53  <antimatroidl> :D
2012-01-24T10:46:07  <antimatroidl> that legitimately made me laugh :)
2012-01-24T10:46:53  <mcstar> i dont think its funny
2012-01-24T10:47:02  <mcstar> its quite sad actually
2012-01-24T10:47:13  <mcstar> thats the worst part of being a nerd
2012-01-24T10:48:27  <antimatroidl> one of my pet peeves is people equating nerds and geeks
2012-01-24T10:49:02  <mcstar> i guess im both
2012-01-24T10:49:17  <pairofdice> a carnival performer who performs sensationally morbid or disgusting acts?
2012-01-24T10:49:23  <pairofdice> (from wiki)
2012-01-24T10:50:01  <mcstar> sounds like somethign straight out of my CV
2012-01-24T10:50:38  <antimatroidl> to me, nerd = proper interest in a science/maths/etc. geek = star wars, big bang theory, reading, etc.
2012-01-24T10:50:51  <antimatroidl> nerds are obviously superior :P
2012-01-24T10:50:56  <pairofdice> haha
2012-01-24T10:51:41  <antimatroidl> CS/EE/SE people are nerds, but just general computer enthusiasts are geeks
2012-01-24T10:52:16  <mcstar> antimatroidl: you got it backwards
2012-01-24T10:52:19  <antimatroidl> of course they aren't mutually exclusive, i just dislike people equating the two
2012-01-24T10:52:32  <antimatroidl> mcstar; bollocks :P
2012-01-24T10:53:03  <pairofdice> In a 2007 interview on The Colbert Report, Richard Clarke said the difference between nerds and geeks is "geeks get it done."
2012-01-24T10:53:17  * pairofdice shrugs
2012-01-24T10:53:41  <pairofdice> I'm not a share holder of either
2012-01-24T10:53:55  <mcstar> my perspective: geek: educated, usually smart, focused, has some talent, awkward
2012-01-24T10:54:47  <mcstar> nerd: seems to think he is the king of the world, a know-it-all, but sometimes without real knowledge, likes all kinds of stupid fiction, awkward, socially underdeveloped
2012-01-24T10:55:12  <pairofdice> I can't see the difference :)
2012-01-24T10:55:23  <antimatroidl> action
2012-01-24T10:55:45  <antimatroidl> there's a lot of "really smart" people who have never "applied themselves"
2012-01-24T10:56:04  <mcstar> and many of them can be nerds
2012-01-24T10:56:06  <mcstar> (are)
2012-01-24T10:56:38  <mcstar> i think geek is a better trait than nerd
2012-01-24T10:57:28  <mcstar> but probably both of themr ealize this conversation happens only when nerds or geeks are around
2012-01-24T10:59:06  <mcstar> oh, and there are eggheads
2012-01-24T10:59:56  <antimatroidl> yeah
2012-01-24T10:59:58  <mcstar> they are really really smart/educated, but they dont really have anything else, no hobbies, other activities, they live strictly for the job
2012-01-24T11:00:30  <mcstar> and to be complete, there are balanced individuals
2012-01-24T11:01:26  <mcstar> they have friends, wife, children, and they still considered good in their respective fields, without spending an excessive time on any of their interests

2012-01-24T12:11:38  <antimatroidl> what's ironic about a dinisaur?
2012-01-24T12:12:48  <antimatroidl> i would move interest in games, movies, battlestar galactica to geeks
2012-01-24T12:12:56  <antimatroidl> and fantasy/sci fi
2012-01-24T12:13:02  <antimatroidl> sci fi is pseudo science
2012-01-24T12:16:19  <mcstar> i dont like lord of the.., arrested dev.  and anchorman
2012-01-24T12:16:45  <antimatroidl> yeah this infographic isn't perfect
2012-01-24T12:16:58  <antimatroidl> imo there are no movies for nerds
2012-01-24T12:17:15  <mcstar> how so?
2012-01-24T12:17:30  <mcstar> there are a lot of science shows/documentaries
2012-01-24T12:17:44  <antimatroidl> too many plot holes, things unexplained, documentaries are too basic/full of crap
2012-01-24T12:17:48  <mcstar> movies usually contain ficiton
2012-01-24T12:17:53  <mcstar> so in that sense ..
2012-01-24T12:18:02  <antimatroidl> there's two kinds of fiction
2012-01-24T12:18:10  <mcstar> the erotic and the plain
2012-01-24T12:18:16  <antimatroidl> those that sort of push what is plausible and those which completely ignore what we know

2012-01-24T12:19:08  <mcstar> even if something is complete bullshit but it isnt intended to be serious, its ok
2012-01-24T12:19:22  <antimatroidl> yeah, but a sci fi show should not be like that imo
2012-01-24T12:19:32  <mcstar> it depends
2012-01-24T12:19:39  <antimatroidl> and csi for example i think should try to be scientifically correct
2012-01-24T12:19:42  <mcstar> take Galaxy Quest for example
2012-01-24T12:19:58  <thestinger> antimatroidl: csi doesn't even have to do with forensics
2012-01-24T12:19:58  <antimatroidl> i find it funny that to write for simpsons you basically need to be a maths/phsics phd and then csi

2012-01-24T12:20:30  <thestinger> those shows are all really bad

2012-01-24T12:20:51  <mcstar> oh no
2012-01-24T12:20:53  <antimatroidl> yeah well i don't see why they couldn't get the scientific aspects right
2012-01-24T12:20:56  <mcstar> crime scene investigators?
2012-01-24T12:21:09  <antimatroidl> i don't watch it, it's just the obvious example from that youtube video
2012-01-24T12:21:11  <mcstar> i dont watch those at all
2012-01-24T12:21:43  <mcstar> i liked the new series with nathan fillion
2012-01-24T12:21:50  <mcstar> they did some investigations
2012-01-24T12:21:59  <mcstar> with a beautiful detective woman
2012-01-24T12:22:28  <mcstar> oh, and there is dexter ofc
2012-01-24T12:22:44  <mcstar> the pinaccle of non sci-fi series that i love
2012-01-24T12:23:17  <mcstar> (this is probably very un-nerdy from me)
2012-01-24T12:23:47  <mcstar> antimatroidl: what youtube video?
2012-01-24T12:24:43  <antimatroidl> zoom in on this
2012-01-24T12:24:52  <antimatroidl> just youtube csi
2012-01-24T12:24:59  <antimatroidl> i'd be surprised if it's not the first hit
2012-01-24T12:25:28  <antimatroidl> anyway, sleep

2012-01-24T12:34:44  <thestinger> meh
2012-01-24T12:34:52  <thestinger> was a let down for me
2012-01-24T12:35:00  <mcstar> what?
2012-01-24T12:35:05  <thestinger> imo it was a pretty poor adaptation of the books, even though it was pretty true to them
2012-01-24T12:35:05  <pairofdice> let down? ehh
2012-01-24T12:35:17  <thestinger> if you hadn't read the books it was just a great hbo series
2012-01-24T12:35:19  <thestinger> have you read them?
2012-01-24T12:35:21  <pairofdice> No
2012-01-24T12:35:33  <mcstar> will i find that interesting?
2012-01-24T12:35:34  <pairofdice> I don't generally compare books to movies
2012-01-24T12:35:42  <thestinger> mcstar: game of thrones?
2012-01-24T12:35:45  <mcstar> yes
2012-01-24T12:35:50  <thestinger> don't watch the series before reading the first book imo
2012-01-24T12:36:01  <mcstar> i wont read the books
2012-01-24T12:36:01  <thestinger> they are the best books I've read
2012-01-24T12:36:25  <thestinger> well it was a pretty good series
2012-01-24T12:36:27  <mcstar> i dont read much fiction, theres no time for that
2012-01-24T12:36:30  <thestinger> mcstar: what TV series/movies do you like?
2012-01-24T12:36:31  <pairofdice> Pretty good...
2012-01-24T12:36:51  <mcstar> thestinger: mostly scifi
2012-01-24T12:36:56  <mcstar> i liked Kings
2012-01-24T12:36:57  <pairofdice> As TV goes, it's gold
2012-01-24T12:37:13  <thestinger> well, imo boardwalk empire is the best HBO series atm
2012-01-24T12:37:14  <mcstar> is it something like that>
2012-01-24T12:37:55  <mcstar> ah, no gangsters
2012-01-24T12:38:39  <thestinger> the book series if 'a song of ice and fire', it's sort of fantasy but without the traditional fantasy stuff
2012-01-24T12:39:42  <thestinger> at least until the later books
2012-01-24T12:40:43  <thestinger> mostly politics, war, romance, etc. and the writing is dark/cynical
2012-01-24T12:41:05  <thestinger> the books take place over a long period of time and have hundreds of characters who get developed, which didn't happen in the TV series
2012-01-24T12:41:24  <thestinger> they cut down ~5 years of time in the book to like a year and barely touched on most of the characters
2012-01-24T12:41:38  <pairofdice> I like how everyone dies
2012-01-24T12:41:41  <thestinger> great plot/acting but no depth
2012-01-24T12:42:03  <pairofdice> Main characters live and die
2012-01-24T12:42:25  <thestinger> well he often kills off characters and introduces new ones
2012-01-24T12:42:35  <thestinger> the books are like 1300 pages and each chapter is from the POV of a character
2012-01-24T12:42:38  <mcstar> so its like real life
2012-01-24T12:42:45  <thestinger> he often switches the focus
2012-01-24T12:43:19  <pairofdice> mcstar: how many tv shows doe that
2012-01-24T12:43:23  <pairofdice> do*

2012-01-24T12:43:25  <thestinger> for example people he makes you hate in the first book become main characters in later ones
2012-01-24T12:43:31  <thestinger> and you learn to understand/like them
2012-01-24T12:43:40  <thestinger> and everyone dies :P
2012-01-24T12:44:04  <thestinger> pairofdice: the next seasons of game of thrones will probably be a lot better
2012-01-24T12:44:14  <thestinger> they did the first season assuming they might not be making more
2012-01-24T12:44:20  <thestinger> so they packed a lot of stuff into barely any time
2012-01-24T12:45:09  <thestinger> they did the entire first book, which is as long as all three LOTR books (maybe longer)
2012-01-24T12:45:22  <pairofdice> Yeah, next season starts in march
2012-01-24T12:46:01  <thestinger> anyway they will _have_ to slow down the pace and stop skipping stuff or they'll run out of material :P

2012-01-24T12:56:54  <mcstar> if i start something new, it will be comedy
