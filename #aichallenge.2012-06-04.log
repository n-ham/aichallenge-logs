2012-06-04T15:30:03  <thestinger> I'm too lazy to do the crypto one
2012-06-04T15:30:26  <thestinger> I made the regex lexer/parser/interpreter for the language one though, which was a lot of fun
2012-06-04T15:30:34  <thestinger> so I did 3/4 all the way :P
2012-06-04T15:31:05  <thestinger> I just stopped liking the crypto one near the end... I couldn't get their server for one of the challenge problems to work so meh
