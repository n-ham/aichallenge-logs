2012-08-02T04:51:14  <mcstar> oh
2012-08-02T04:51:16  <mcstar> hi
2012-08-02T04:51:46  <mcstar> i see
2012-08-02T04:51:54  <mcstar> im glad you are interested in it
2012-08-02T04:52:04  <UncleVasya> http://ideone.com/pyTr0
2012-08-02T04:52:10  <mcstar> you are young, there is plenty of time to sleep later
2012-08-02T04:52:13  <UncleVasya> Is it it?
2012-08-02T04:53:28  <mcstar> ill have to study it
2012-08-02T04:54:16  <mcstar> im sure i didnt have a tuple
2012-08-02T04:54:27  <mcstar> both in haskell and ocaml i used records
2012-08-02T04:54:43  <UncleVasya> hmm
2012-08-02T04:55:51  <mcstar> there is no lookup function
2012-08-02T04:55:51  <UncleVasya> let 'a TST = Empty | 'a * 'a TST * 'a TST * 'a TST    -   wasn't it yours?
2012-08-02T04:56:01  <mcstar> type node = { nodeVal : char; isEnd : bool; loNode : tst; eqNode : tst; hiNode : tst }
2012-08-02T04:56:03  <mcstar> and tst = Empty | Node of node
2012-08-02T04:56:27  <UncleVasya> Yes, it's not finished yet :)
2012-08-02T04:57:09  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i dont think you understood the idea of a ternary search tree
2012-08-02T04:57:14  <UncleVasya> Oh, so I tried to make different and fall into your solution :D
2012-08-02T04:57:15  <mcstar> what you have is a ternary tree
2012-08-02T04:57:52  <UncleVasya> * what you have at this moment
2012-08-02T04:58:07  <mcstar> the TST stores strings
2012-08-02T04:58:14  <mcstar> the nodes contain a character of a string
2012-08-02T04:58:47  <mcstar> and, they contain a bool for example, that signifies whether or not a given node is a terminal node of a string
2012-08-02T04:59:16  <mcstar> you dont just store values in such a tree, like you do with integers, you store whole strings of chars(or integers)
2012-08-02T04:59:36  <mcstar> these stored strings share structure with other strings
2012-08-02T05:00:34  <UncleVasya> I'll have an access to unlimited internet today. Is it something I need to continue play with you? Something but Emacs, tyrex, Batteries and Jane Street Core?
2012-08-02T05:00:42  <UncleVasya> http://ideone.com/xF015
2012-08-02T05:01:17  <UncleVasya> OK, so I need to add bool.
2012-08-02T05:01:41  <mcstar> and insert will be more complicated
2012-08-02T05:02:02  <mcstar> UncleVasya: just download the tools that you need to write ocaml
2012-08-02T05:02:05  <UncleVasya> I didn't read much about search trees and focused on just a tree (my first as you remember) :)
2012-08-02T05:02:36  <mcstar> UncleVasya: i dont think ill be 'playing' with you much, i have some really important business to finish
2012-08-02T05:02:40  <mcstar> but i we can talk
2012-08-02T05:02:52  <UncleVasya> I'm already happy with my Notepad++ :)
2012-08-02T05:02:53  <mcstar> i just wont be writing ocaml/haskell for a time
2012-08-02T05:03:05  <mcstar> -i
2012-08-02T05:03:34  <mcstar> UncleVasya: if you are really interested in ocaml, you should try the things you mentioned
2012-08-02T05:03:43  <mcstar> but ultimately it is your decision
2012-08-02T05:03:46  <mcstar> mi just saying

2012-08-02T10:27:10  <mcstar> this is a watermelon speaking
2012-08-02T10:27:13  <antimatroid> A project will deliver $90 now, -$10 in a fortnight's time, and $30 in two fortnight's time. The
2012-08-02T10:27:13  <antimatroid> appropriate interest/discount rate is j26 = 8.060% p.a. The Present Value (i.e period 0) of the
2012-08-02T10:27:13  <antimatroid> ENTIRE cashflow delivered is:
2012-08-02T10:27:13  <mcstar> i ate mcstar
2012-08-02T10:27:28  <antimatroid> i need to make sure i'm not an idiot before i send out an email saying test answers are wrong
2012-08-02T10:27:53  <mcstar> well, since im just a watermelon, im not sure i can be of much help
2012-08-02T10:27:56  <mcstar> but i can try!
2012-08-02T10:28:00  <antimatroid> :P
2012-08-02T10:28:08  <antimatroid> anyone else feel free to give me an answer
2012-08-02T10:29:46  <mcstar> antimatroid: do you want to give more information, or what you pasted is sufficient?
2012-08-02T10:30:01  <mcstar> i suppose it isnt
2012-08-02T10:30:08  <antimatroid> what i've given is sufficient
2012-08-02T10:30:30  <mcstar> j26? whats that?
2012-08-02T10:30:47  <antimatroid> the interest rate per annum, but compounded fortnightly
2012-08-02T10:30:56  <antimatroid> so i = j26/26
2012-08-02T10:31:04  <antimatroid> where i is the nominal interest rate
2012-08-02T10:31:19  <mcstar> fortnight == 2 weeks?
2012-08-02T10:31:23  <antimatroid> yeah
2012-08-02T10:33:57  <mcstar> antimatroid: i have no idea what to do
2012-08-02T10:34:08  <mcstar> im not a merchant
2012-08-02T10:34:10  <mcstar> or whatever
2012-08-02T10:34:14  <antimatroid> that's cool
2012-08-02T10:34:18  <mcstar> wth has interest here?
2012-08-02T10:34:21  <antimatroid> it doesn't help if i tell you what to do :P
2012-08-02T10:34:28  <mcstar> antimatroid: ok let me think
2012-08-02T10:34:41  <antimatroid> nah, i'll ask #math and cop being laughed at
2012-08-02T10:35:06  <mcstar> antimatroid: im sure i can help, im just not familiar with the setup
2012-08-02T10:35:28  <mcstar> is this some kind of investment?
2012-08-02T10:36:13  <mcstar> why would a project deliver atm?
2012-08-02T10:36:34  <mcstar> it needs funds, which are loaned
2012-08-02T10:36:42  <mcstar> that loan has interest
2012-08-02T10:37:00  <mcstar> so you can ask how much the project need to profit, to pay off the loans
2012-08-02T10:37:06  <mcstar> or something similar
2012-08-02T10:37:25  <antimatroid> the point is, what's the present value of the amounts
2012-08-02T10:37:38  <antimatroid> ie. convert the future amounts into current terms with the given interest rate then sum them
2012-08-02T10:37:52  <mcstar> yeah, ok but whats the interest rate?
2012-08-02T10:37:56  <mcstar> is it infalation?
2012-08-02T10:37:59  <mcstar> inflation
2012-08-02T10:38:25  <mcstar> anyway, let me write this down
2012-08-02T10:40:00  <antimatroid> ignore inflation
2012-08-02T10:40:19  <antimatroid> it's basically what would you have to invest now at that interest rate to get that amount in the future
2012-08-02T10:41:53  <antimatroid> or for a negative value, what would you have to borrow now to have that debt in n periods with the given interest rate

2012-08-02T10:49:06  <mcstar> what did you get?

2012-08-02T10:50:46  <antimatroid> should be 90 - 10(1 + 0.0806/26)^(-1) + 30(1 + 0.0806/26)^(-2) no?
2012-08-02T10:51:33  <mcstar> i have no idea what that 26 is
2012-08-02T10:51:45  <mcstar> i used 8.06/100
2012-08-02T10:51:55  <mcstar> but the formula is the same otherwise
2012-08-02T10:52:09  <antimatroid> wut?
2012-08-02T10:52:24  <mcstar> the function i pasted and what you pasted does the same thing
2012-08-02T10:52:32  <antimatroid> then why did we get different answers?
2012-08-02T10:52:43  <mcstar> because i have no ieda what 26 is
2012-08-02T10:52:57  <mcstar> you used 8.06/26
2012-08-02T10:52:57  <antimatroid> the number of compounding periods per anum
2012-08-02T10:52:58  <mcstar> i used
2012-08-02T10:53:00  <mcstar> you used 8.06/100
2012-08-02T10:53:08  <antimatroid> i used 0.0806/26
2012-08-02T10:53:15  <antimatroid> the nominal rate i is j_m/m
2012-08-02T10:53:36  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure i'm right, i'ma just send the email
2012-08-02T10:54:28  <mcstar> antimatroid: 109.80 and 109.8457655 are basically the same numbers
2012-08-02T10:54:36  <mcstar> the guy just rounded
2012-08-02T10:55:00  <antimatroid> nah
2012-08-02T10:55:06  <antimatroid> this guy is anal about rounding
2012-08-02T10:55:13  <antimatroid> he wouldn't round like that
2012-08-02T10:55:16  <antimatroid> some of them are further off
2012-08-02T10:56:06  <mcstar> antimatroid: ah 26 = 52/2
2012-08-02T10:56:13  <mcstar> antimatroid: why didnt you tell me?
2012-08-02T10:56:20  <mcstar> i asked you what is 26
2012-08-02T10:56:57  <antimatroid> (00:30:14) mcstar: j26? whats that?
2012-08-02T10:56:58  <antimatroid> (00:30:31) antimatroid: the interest rate per annum, but compounded fortnightly
2012-08-02T10:56:58  <antimatroid> (00:30:40) antimatroid: so i = j26/26
2012-08-02T10:56:58  <antimatroid> (00:30:47) antimatroid: where i is the nominal interest rate
2012-08-02T10:57:00  <antimatroid> i told you
2012-08-02T10:57:01  <mcstar> anyway, i calculated the correct thing with the annual j
2012-08-02T10:57:14  <antimatroid> my correct or their correct?
2012-08-02T10:57:18  <antimatroid> i've sent the email now anyway
2012-08-02T10:57:23  <mcstar> your correct ofc
2012-08-02T10:57:24  <antimatroid> so if i'm wrong i'll look silly anyway
2012-08-02T10:57:28  <antimatroid> :D
2012-08-02T10:57:33  <antimatroid> i don't like being wrong
2012-08-02T10:57:38  <mcstar> antimatroid: just put that function into a python iterpreter
2012-08-02T10:57:48  <antimatroid> i think i've corrected every test i've been asked to check for eco so far this year
2012-08-02T10:57:50  <antimatroid> that's a bit worrying
2012-08-02T10:57:57  <antimatroid> i used a spreadsheet
2012-08-02T10:58:13  <antimatroid> i had 12 lots of 6 questions
2012-08-02T10:58:46  <mcstar> antimatroid: i = j26/26 still doesnt make sense; j(fortnight) = j(annual)/26 does
2012-08-02T10:59:08  <antimatroid> now you're just arguing notation
2012-08-02T10:59:23  <mcstar> antimatroid: yeah, but that tripped me up, and i am annoyed
2012-08-02T10:59:28  <antimatroid> :p
2012-08-02T10:59:30  <mcstar> but ill calm now
2012-08-02T10:59:55  <antimatroid> sweet, well i have to turn up to uni tomorrow to show face but i'm basically at the weekend
2012-08-02T11:00:02  <antimatroid> plus i think it's going to rain so nothing better to do
2012-08-02T11:00:04  <antimatroid> went skating earlier
2012-08-02T11:00:17  <mcstar> its hot as hell here
2012-08-02T11:00:23  <antimatroid> i wish it was hot here
2012-08-02T11:00:31  <antimatroid> i purcahsed mario galaxy too
2012-08-02T11:00:34  <antimatroid> haven't opened it yet
2012-08-02T11:00:45  <antimatroid> will probably do that (tomorrow, not really) tonight
2012-08-02T11:00:59  <antimatroid> in like 17 hours tonight
2012-08-02T11:01:08  <mcstar> what is that?
2012-08-02T11:01:10  <mcstar> toy?
2012-08-02T11:01:13  <antimatroid> wii game
2012-08-02T11:01:25  <antimatroid> i'm quite behind on games
2012-08-02T11:01:36  <antimatroid> been meaning to play it for ages, went fuck it and got it on ebay
2012-08-02T11:01:59  <mcstar> mario is kind of lame at this age
2012-08-02T11:02:16  <mcstar> little pixelated fellow jumping from mushroom to pipes...
2012-08-02T11:02:52  <mcstar> hey, maybe you would like prince of persia?
2012-08-02T11:02:59  <antimatroid> you take that back
2012-08-02T11:03:00  <mcstar> i think it runs on the atari
2012-08-02T11:03:01  <antimatroid> mario is the shit
2012-08-02T11:03:03  <antimatroid> always will be
2012-08-02T11:03:12  <mcstar> :)
2012-08-02T11:03:14  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-02T11:03:24  <mcstar> k, ill take it back
2012-08-02T11:03:31  <mcstar> im sure it is ubercool
2012-08-02T11:15:41  <antimatroid> i just wanted some mindless fun
2012-08-02T11:15:50  <antimatroid> i suspect it shall provide
2012-08-02T11:18:13  <mcstar> antimatroid: id play it if it was a first person game
2012-08-02T11:18:36  <mcstar> and if mario had sniper rifle or desert eagle
2012-08-02T11:18:38  <antimatroid> it is, assuming fpg is what i think it is
2012-08-02T11:18:42  <antimatroid> oh, no
2012-08-02T11:18:48  <antimatroid> it's not fps
2012-08-02T11:18:54  <mcstar> antimatroid: it is third person game
2012-08-02T11:19:04  <antimatroid> you're a third person game
2012-08-02T11:19:05  <mcstar> i think, you can look at mario from angles
2012-08-02T11:19:15  <mcstar> antimatroid: what?
2012-08-02T11:19:17  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-02T11:53:50  <mcstar> great
2012-08-02T11:53:54  <mcstar> i have a headache

2012-08-02T12:18:54  <mcstar> mleise: load 697ms and check 158ms for ocaml, with records of mutable fields
2012-08-02T12:19:16  <mleise> does immutable make a difference in this context?
2012-08-02T12:19:31  <mcstar> well, yeah it is slower
2012-08-02T12:19:35  <mcstar> the gc must work harder
2012-08-02T12:19:53  <mcstar> if the nodes are mutable, you just have to travel them, like in C, along the pointers
2012-08-02T12:20:06  <mcstar> and dont have to actually deconstruct/reconstruct the tree branches
2012-08-02T12:21:11  <mcstar> mleise: i just donloaded some c++ code fron code.google.com, <800ms for that
2012-08-02T12:21:15  <mcstar> with -O3
2012-08-02T12:21:17  <mleise> well, the performance is ok for every day use I'd say. I should see what the D GC would do if I used it instead of manual memory management
2012-08-02T12:21:38  <mleise> ha! ha! close to 800ms?
2012-08-02T12:22:18  <mcstar> mleise: is that too slow?
2012-08-02T12:22:40  <mcstar> that has load time in it
2012-08-02T12:22:46  <mcstar> i mean, file read time
2012-08-02T12:22:47  <mleise> hey it is "C++" and it is no faster than Ocaml
2012-08-02T12:22:52  <mcstar> it is
2012-08-02T12:23:22  <mcstar> ocaml takes 1.132s
2012-08-02T12:23:25  <mleise> 855 vs. ~800?
2012-08-02T12:23:46  <mcstar> c++ ~790ms for full program run time
2012-08-02T12:24:06  <mcstar> ocaml 1.132s runtime, load 697ms and check 158ms
2012-08-02T12:24:29  <mcstar> but the c++ version uses resizable vectors inside
2012-08-02T12:24:44  <mcstar> and the ocal doesnt, it truly is a tree
2012-08-02T12:24:50  <mcstar> allocated node by node
2012-08-02T12:25:54  <mleise> yes and I'm curious how your code is so fast? remember my 400ms for lookup? what do i do wrong? :/
2012-08-02T12:26:10  <mleise> despite using 220000 words instead of 200000
2012-08-02T12:26:18  <mleise> *except for
2012-08-02T12:26:34  <mcstar> mleise: my timing are for the sorted dict
2012-08-02T12:26:46  <mcstar> let me try with the random one
2012-08-02T12:27:16  <mcstar> c++ 0m1.115s
2012-08-02T12:27:38  <mleise> oh, surprise surprise
2012-08-02T12:27:57  <mleise> the sorted list gives me 120ms for lookup
2012-08-02T12:27:57  <mcstar> ocaml 0m1.588s = file read in  306
2012-08-02T12:27:59  <mcstar> tree created in  961
2012-08-02T12:28:01  <mcstar> checking in  301
2012-08-02T12:28:43  <mcstar> mleise: 300ms vs 400 ms for the random one XD
2012-08-02T12:29:10  <mleise> yeeeeess, i see that
2012-08-02T12:29:24  <mcstar> (well, at this point there no point in this comparison, your dict and cpu is different from mine
2012-08-02T12:29:28  <mcstar> )
2012-08-02T12:30:53  <mcstar> the best of all of them, is my first haskell one
2012-08-02T12:30:59  <mcstar> immutable, clean and short
2012-08-02T12:31:08  <mcstar> and not too slow
2012-08-02T12:31:59  <mleise> here is my exe if you want to give me some accurate comparison :) : https://www.dropbox.com/s/ddlcxfvoub1jazs/trie
2012-08-02T12:32:23  <mleise> yes, immutability is pretty nice if it works out
2012-08-02T12:32:30  <mcstar> mleise: http://sprunge.us/TSHT?ocaml here is the imutable ocaml, if you feel like you should study it XD
2012-08-02T12:32:38  <mcstar> mutable*
2012-08-02T12:35:53  <mcstar> whoa, yours loads the file in 70ms
2012-08-02T12:36:08  <mcstar> standard ocaml strings are slow

2012-08-02T12:39:19  <mleise> So the speed is the same more or less, ok :)
2012-08-02T12:42:13  <mcstar> mleise: now turn that gc on, and lets see the results!
2012-08-02T12:42:28  <mcstar> i guess, it would be too much work
2012-08-02T12:42:42  <mcstar> and you are too fond of manual memory allocation
2012-08-02T12:43:33  <mleise> Walter (inventor of D) started a topic about a lexer for D in the std library @ 2:10 AM, now it has 67 replies
2012-08-02T12:44:07  <mleise> it's not like we talked about that in a dozen other threads throughout the last years, nooo :D
2012-08-02T12:44:08  <mcstar> what am i supposed to say?
2012-08-02T12:44:12  <mcstar> peaple use D?
2012-08-02T12:44:56  <mleise> no, I wonder why this topic isn't silent and instead we have a good wiki where we collect such ideas like Rust does
2012-08-02T12:45:15  <mcstar> idk
2012-08-02T12:45:15  <mleise> because he isn't saying a lot of new things
2012-08-02T12:45:26  <mcstar> D ppl are talkative
2012-08-02T12:45:36  <mleise> yet a big bikeshedding discussion evolves
2012-08-02T12:46:43  <mleise> There are also at least 3 people working on D lexers, one has a moslty working complete comiler, another one worked closely with the community to get some ideas
2012-08-02T12:46:45  <mcstar> yea, i need a new bikeshed too
2012-08-02T12:46:53  <mcstar> i want to paint it green
2012-08-02T12:46:57  <mleise> what's with your old one?
2012-08-02T12:47:12  <mcstar> yeah, ok, there is that, i can use my old one
2012-08-02T12:47:23  <mcstar> but a new bikeshed would be nicer
2012-08-02T12:47:29  <mcstar> in green color
2012-08-02T12:47:35  <mcstar> XD
2012-08-02T12:47:44  <mcstar> mleise: im bikeshedding, damn it!
2012-08-02T12:49:14  <mleise> ok, but why not pink? cool-down-pink.
2012-08-02T12:49:47  <mleise> (google for it ^^)
2012-08-02T12:50:13  <mcstar> mleise: so, are you considering switching to a better-than-D language?
2012-08-02T12:50:32  <mleise> mcstar: Java?
2012-08-02T12:50:40  <mcstar> rust
2012-08-02T12:51:01  <mcstar> very nice color, this cool-down-pink is
2012-08-02T12:51:08  <mleise> oh I don't think Rust is stable enough to be taken seriously
2012-08-02T12:51:10  <mcstar> am i supposed to find some other thing?
2012-08-02T12:51:42  <mleise> yes, you are supposed to find talks about the psychological effect on human beings and the prison cell painted in this color
2012-08-02T12:51:45  <mleise> hey what's that? http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/
2012-08-02T12:51:58  <mleise> they _have_ a Linux team?
2012-08-02T12:53:08  <mcstar> apparently
2012-08-02T12:55:40  <UncleVasya> mcstar: why you want mleise to switch from D?
2012-08-02T12:55:56  <mcstar> D looks like c++
2012-08-02T12:55:58  <mleise> UncleVasya: don't you use Rust btw?
2012-08-02T12:56:00  <mcstar> and thats bad
2012-08-02T12:56:13  <mcstar> i want him to use ocaml or haskell
2012-08-02T12:56:24  <mleise> yes I wish it was ':=' instead of '=' but otherwise its great
2012-08-02T12:56:32  <UncleVasya> mleise: Delph one love :D
2012-08-02T12:56:40  <UncleVasya> *i
2012-08-02T12:56:43  <mcstar> oh, man delphi
2012-08-02T12:56:56  <mcstar> i recently realized whats the correc tway to say it
2012-08-02T12:57:14  <mleise> you asked a Greek?
2012-08-02T12:57:27  <UncleVasya> mcstar: F#?
2012-08-02T12:57:29  <mcstar> ok, not like that
2012-08-02T12:57:42  <mcstar> but how to say it properly in english
2012-08-02T12:57:52  <mcstar> the thought never occurred to me, that i might say it the wrong way
2012-08-02T12:58:04  <UncleVasya> No it's faster and more advanced than OCaml I think .
2012-08-02T12:58:28  <mcstar> UncleVasya: F# is a language
2012-08-02T12:58:36  <mcstar> there are different implementations
2012-08-02T12:58:40  <mleise> well the resume of the article is: OpenGL is faster than Direct3D and Windows vs. Linux performance are the same
2012-08-02T12:58:58  <mcstar> mono can run it, .net can run it, for example
2012-08-02T12:59:00  <UncleVasya> I say it like D-a-l-f-e. So did you before?
2012-08-02T12:59:06  <mcstar> usually .net is faster than mono
2012-08-02T12:59:18  <mcstar> delfi
2012-08-02T12:59:25  <mcstar> e in edward
2012-08-02T12:59:32  <mcstar> i in incognito
2012-08-02T12:59:37  <mcstar> thats how i said it
2012-08-02T12:59:41  <mcstar> but its del-phi
2012-08-02T12:59:57  <UncleVasya> so do I.
2012-08-02T13:00:04  <mcstar> phi as in fight
2012-08-02T13:00:07  <mleise> no bikeshedding please! facts only: http://delphi.wikia.com/wiki/Delphi_Pronunciation -.-

2012-08-02T13:01:38  <mcstar> not sure
2012-08-02T13:01:40  <mcstar> why?
2012-08-02T13:01:41  <mleise> oh in the D community there is not much love for F#
2012-08-02T13:01:42  <UncleVasya> eh, fail with semantics :)
2012-08-02T13:02:12  <mleise> maybe it lacks at some important points, i never really read those comments
2012-08-02T13:02:18  <mcstar> f# isnt so great on linux
2012-08-02T13:02:36  <UncleVasya> mcstar: Because "it's faster and more advanced than OCaml I think ".
2012-08-02T13:02:44  <UncleVasya> OK
2012-08-02T13:02:45  <mcstar> yeah, i get that, but i dont think so
2012-08-02T13:02:51  <mcstar> it isnt faster
2012-08-02T13:02:56  <mcstar> since it is a LANGUAGE
2012-08-02T13:03:11  <mcstar> and why would it be more advanced?
2012-08-02T13:04:06  <mcstar> jon harrop certainly wants us to believe that f# beats ocaml and haskell
2012-08-02T13:04:25  <mcstar> but thats just an opinion, really
2012-08-02T13:04:26  <UncleVasya> Because it seems to have more attention from its creators than ocaml with its '0.5 manpower'
2012-08-02T13:04:59  <mcstar> just because a language is 'done' it doesnt become obsolete
2012-08-02T13:05:07  <mcstar> look at common lisp
2012-08-02T13:05:17  <mcstar> the specification was done in the 80s
2012-08-02T13:05:42  <mcstar> the ocaml community is active
2012-08-02T13:06:03  <mcstar> there are itnerested parties, that supply high quality standard libraries for example
2012-08-02T13:06:14  <mcstar> there is a good development envrionment..
2012-08-02T13:06:32  <UncleVasya> Thanks for clearing. My thought were standed exactly on Harrops's explanations.
2012-08-02T13:08:15  <UncleVasya> heheh, I'm afraid your lingvistic parser broke on that sentence :D
2012-08-02T13:08:29  <mcstar> doesnt matter, i understood you
2012-08-02T13:09:16  <mcstar> anyway, haskell really, is quite different
2012-08-02T13:09:33  <mcstar> i seriously suggest to both of you UncleVasya mleise to get to know it
2012-08-02T13:09:38  <UncleVasya> I assume in future I'll be able to write only 'fsfsgfdkgskfnjwjrgurhiewajfwqkfl' but your skill of understanding Vasya's texts will be good enough to understand :D
2012-08-02T13:10:21  <mcstar> UncleVasya: ill pipe your texts though gunzip to make them intelligable
2012-08-02T13:10:33  <mcstar> through*
2012-08-02T13:11:29  <UncleVasya> Or ypu can pipe it to dev/null...
2012-08-02T13:11:37  <UncleVasya> *you
2012-08-02T13:12:27  <UncleVasya> Haskell has a lot of people/books/cources/libs and this fact makes it not so romantic for me than ocaml :)
2012-08-02T13:12:46  <UncleVasya> *camparing to ocaml
2012-08-02T13:13:07  <mcstar> wtf
2012-08-02T13:13:11  <UncleVasya> *comparing
2012-08-02T13:13:28  <mcstar> you dont want to get to know it because too many people use it?
2012-08-02T13:13:47  <mcstar> oh man
2012-08-02T13:13:58  <mcstar> haskell is not popular by any means
2012-08-02T13:14:07  <mcstar> not like java or c++
2012-08-02T13:14:10  <UncleVasya> everybody heard Haskell name
2012-08-02T13:14:15  <mcstar> so?
2012-08-02T13:14:19  <mcstar> who the fuck cares?
2012-08-02T13:15:02  <mcstar> if you are really choosing languages based on some measure of unpopularity, then you are gravely wrong
2012-08-02T13:15:31  <UncleVasya> yeah, I know :)
2012-08-02T13:16:03  <mcstar> there is talk about haskell, because it is quite different from everything you know, from other functional languages even, and yet is is usable, it is developed actively(both the language and the implementation) and has a great community
2012-08-02T13:16:30  <mcstar> if you dont like challenges, than dont bother with it
2012-08-02T13:16:38  <mcstar> haskell is not trivial
2012-08-02T13:16:48  <mcstar> but not in a way like c++
2012-08-02T13:18:21  <UncleVasya> Haskell needs a good brain in programmer who use it? If so, I can not use it, that's for sure :D
2012-08-02T13:19:04  <mcstar> first you have to try it, to know for certain
2012-08-02T13:19:25  <UncleVasya> something like thinking in a formal way, proving something
2012-08-02T13:20:41  <UncleVasya> OK, but first I need to learn ocaml better than I do now.
2012-08-02T13:21:17  <mcstar> sounds like a plan
2012-08-02T13:25:05  <UncleVasya> It is strange, I wrote a succesfull enough bot with ocaml but when I tried to code something few das ago I realised that I don't remember very basic things. I think that's because I didn't really learned ocaml but just googled how to do thing n every time i needed it. So now (well, after tree) I'll try to learn it in the standart way: chapter by chapter :)
2012-08-02T13:26:50  <UncleVasya> And that's why I asked you about how you know some things. Because I think you has _that_ knowledge in ocaml - systematized.
2012-08-02T13:28:50  <mcstar> i read some chapters from the ocaml manual
2012-08-02T13:28:54  <mcstar> when i needed it
2012-08-02T13:29:21  <mcstar> and asked around on #ocaml when i couldnt figure something out
2012-08-02T13:29:47  <mcstar> like, why does this tail recursive function overflow?
2012-08-02T13:29:54  <UncleVasya> hmm, sounds the way I did. :D
2012-08-02T13:30:15  <mcstar> because i like a mad man, put the whole recursive call in a try/with clause
2012-08-02T13:31:11  <mcstar> the problem with me and ocaml is that i got to know haskell before ocaml
2012-08-02T13:31:44  <mcstar> but haskell is non-strict so that changes some things
2012-08-02T13:32:33  <mcstar> overall, ocaml's syntax is harder to follow, and you cant see the code from the 'let's as i said many times

2012-08-02T18:16:01  <UncleVasya> mleise, are you around?
2012-08-02T18:16:23  <UncleVasya> Wanna figure out one thing about TST.
2012-08-02T18:22:17  *** NoxiaZ^ <NoxiaZ^!~noxi@87-104-29-39-dynamic-customer.profibernet.dk> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2012-08-02T18:22:43  <mleise> UncleVasya: shoot
2012-08-02T18:23:53  <UncleVasya> Let's say I have a tree  A->B->C->D->F
2012-08-02T18:24:17  <UncleVasya> And words    ABCDF,  BC.
2012-08-02T18:24:41  <UncleVasya> So I have Endword flag at nodes C and F.
2012-08-02T18:25:16  <UncleVasya> What happens if I look for ABC  word?
2012-08-02T18:27:03  <UncleVasya> From my understanding of TST I get this flow:    search goes through A, then through B and on C it sees Endword and thinks that word ABC is in the tree.
2012-08-02T18:27:47  <mleise> It is a ternary search tree, but you displayed a linked list :p
2012-08-02T18:28:12  <UncleVasya> No, it is a variation of TST :D
2012-08-02T18:28:35  <UncleVasya> I can draw some another nodes if you want :)
2012-08-02T18:28:39  <mleise> e.g. if A was the split character for the root node, then ABCDF would take the eqNode and BC would take the hiNode
2012-08-02T18:28:55  <mleise> so they are already ending up in other branches of the tree
2012-08-02T18:29:49  <mleise> in other words, there are _two_ C nodes, one of which is also an endword node
2012-08-02T18:30:11  <mleise> and ABC will hit the node that does not have endword set
2012-08-02T18:30:18  <UncleVasya> ah, I see. My case never happens because of design. Thanks!
