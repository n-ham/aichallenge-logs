2010-09-15T00:02:01  <genericbob> I still use Gentoo
2010-09-15T00:02:29  <McLeopold> is there some gentoo package I need to compile the server maybe?
2010-09-15T00:02:40  <dmj111> dwchandler: the server looks good... thanks for setting it up.

2010-09-15T00:03:54  <McLeopold> Hey, my server is purple with decals.  How'd you know.
2010-09-15T00:03:55  <dwchandler> dmj111: np :)
2010-09-15T00:04:10  <fisxoj> I found something about testing lisp bots on another server on the forum, any info on how to do that?
2010-09-15T00:04:53  <rogue780|server> so...I had to replace arc4random() with rand()
2010-09-15T00:04:57  <rogue780|server> I hope that didn't change much
2010-09-15T00:05:19  <dwchandler> I have to have a smoke and a stiff drink before getting into httpd config
2010-09-15T00:05:21  <McLeopold> yeah, arc4random is troubling me too
2010-09-15T00:05:29  <Queue29> fisxoj, until earlier today, there was a nice alternative server that we were playing on, where the bot would run on your own pc, but it's down
2010-09-15T00:05:35  <rogue780|server> McLeopold, replace it with rand() and it compiles fine
2010-09-15T00:05:50  <fisxoj> Queue29, aw, now we have to wait for lisp support in the main server, then?
2010-09-15T00:05:58  <Queue29> fisxoj, read through this: http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=424
2010-09-15T00:06:08  <Queue29> hey man, i'm waiting for support for D
2010-09-15T00:06:13  <dwchandler> arc4random is available on most Linux, but you may need other/different includes, iirc
2010-09-15T00:06:39  <McLeopold> okay rogue, now compile the htdocs and see what you get

2010-09-15T00:08:18  <dwchandler> if someone else gets tcp server up that's cool, but I'm also fine with leaving it up on my server. It's decently fast with an ok connection
2010-09-15T00:08:31  <dwchandler> whatever works out
2010-09-15T00:08:56  <dwchandler> I'd rather only have one or two, so we don't split between a bunch of servers

2010-09-15T01:03:12  <rogue780|server> McLeopold, all I did was include my strlcpy.h and canvas.c compiled

2010-09-15T02:00:11  <madsy> Yeah, any connected graph.
2010-09-15T02:01:02  <bartwe_> nodes in the tree are possilbe game states
2010-09-15T02:01:13  <bartwe_> edges are possible fleet movements
2010-09-15T02:01:41  <bartwe_> now you need a way to generate a small enough number of edges
2010-09-15T02:01:46  <drewrobb> thats a fat graph
2010-09-15T02:01:49  <bartwe_> and a scoring function for a state
2010-09-15T02:02:07  <bartwe_> then use a* to dynamicly deepen the graph

2010-09-15T03:20:36  <bartwe_> phonetic all the way ;)
2010-09-15T03:20:39  <sigh> :D
2010-09-15T03:21:23  <antimatroid> i'm going to add heaps to my bot over the weekend, hopefully i can consistently own you people then :)
2010-09-15T03:21:34  <antimatroid> although i suspect others will be intending the same
2010-09-15T03:21:40  <antimatroid> (sure)*
2010-09-15T03:21:54  <antimatroid> but i'm +10GMT, so I sort of get a head start
2010-09-15T03:22:02  <sigh> not on me
2010-09-15T03:22:11  <antimatroid> yes, but i started beating you over night :P
2010-09-15T03:22:32  <sigh> haha
2010-09-15T03:22:40  <antimatroid> and got you on the main site earlier (under youwillfail)
2010-09-15T03:22:49  <sigh> ah, that's you
2010-09-15T03:22:53  <antimatroid> :)
2010-09-15T03:23:00  <bartwe_> beutifull failure
2010-09-15T03:23:04  <sigh> my bot on the main site is one from 5 days ago

2010-09-15T03:23:17  <bartwe_> 7.8 was so strong after basicly losing
2010-09-15T03:23:19  <antimatroid> yeah, well i had you on tcp last night after you left too :P
2010-09-15T03:23:24  <bartwe_> still loses ofcourse
2010-09-15T03:23:26  <antimatroid> but doesn't mean anything yet anyway
2010-09-15T03:23:34  <sigh> :)
2010-09-15T03:23:47  <sigh> well done (unless it was just my bot timing out)
2010-09-15T03:23:48  <antimatroid> i think wtfbbq updated their
2010-09-15T03:23:49  <antimatroid> bot

2010-09-15T03:30:08  <retybok> I'm on the verge of a complete rewrite, I've reached the limits of the current model
2010-09-15T03:30:33  <bartwe_> whats the 'current model' ?
2010-09-15T03:30:45  <retybok> I treat each of my planets independently
2010-09-15T03:31:19  <retybok> it's great because it's simple, but then I can't make coordinated attacks

2010-09-15T03:31:30  <retybok> also I need a better risk model
2010-09-15T03:33:08  <retybok> I'm still amazed to be 25th of the general contest with such a simple bot :)
2010-09-15T03:33:24  <retybok> that's the beauty of starting early, I guess. Things will get a lot more difficult in a month or so

2010-09-15T03:50:19  <bss03> antimatroid: Not sure how to Elo on 3-player matches, I could at least list recent games.
2010-09-15T03:50:34  <antimatroid> just show the matches i suspect

2010-09-15T04:02:29  <delt0r___> just kidding... but you probably need cygwin or something for a free compiler
2010-09-15T04:02:29  <vizier> delt0r: :( yes im using windows... im to lazy to boot up linux
2010-09-15T04:03:23  <delt0r___> tcp.c is 100% is probably just ANSI C so it should just compile on anything

2010-09-15T04:37:27  <EvGenius> vizier: did you install gcc package for cygwin?

2010-09-15T04:40:03  <Baphomet> then you be doing it wrong
2010-09-15T04:40:11  <vizier> EvGenius: actually possibly not, where would i find it>
2010-09-15T04:41:22  <delt0r___> vizier: I think --thought cygwin had like a update/automagic download and install everything fetrue?
2010-09-15T04:41:22  <ShadeS> any ideas?
2010-09-15T04:41:32  <ShadeS> I changed the 1 to a 2 and I still don't see more than 1 fleet
2010-09-15T04:41:33  <vizier> so did i
2010-09-15T04:41:34  <sinan> ShadeS: how are you recompiling?
2010-09-15T04:41:43  <ShadeS> g++ mybot.cc planetwars.cc -o mybot1.exe
2010-09-15T04:41:46  <EvGenius> well, when you install cygwin, you can select which packages are you going to install
2010-09-15T04:41:50  <Naktibalda> ShadeS: you are recompiling it wrong or executing a wrong file
2010-09-15T04:41:57  <ShadeS> java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map6.txt 1000 1000 log.txt "java -jar
2010-09-15T04:42:04  <ShadeS> example_bots/RandomBot.jar" MyBot1.exe | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar
2010-09-15T04:42:11  <ShadeS> is my batch file for it
2010-09-15T04:42:16  <Naktibalda> ShadeS: does it overwrite files?
2010-09-15T04:42:17  <EvGenius> vizier: post somewhere the result of cygcheck -c -d
2010-09-15T04:42:29  <ShadeS> mybot.exe was the 1 value, mybot1.exe had the value set to 2
2010-09-15T04:42:36  <ShadeS> it shouldn't need to over write anything
2010-09-15T04:42:55  <sinan> ShadeS: to be on the same side, delete the old mybot1.exe before compiling the new, or check the timestamp to know it actually has changed
2010-09-15T04:43:08  <sinan> ShadeS: umm ...
2010-09-15T04:43:17  <sinan> ShadeS: did you change anything in the code other than the number of fleets?
2010-09-15T04:43:28  <vizier> EvGenius: no for some reason i didn't get it...
2010-09-15T04:43:37  <sinan> ShadeS: are you sure you saved your files before compiling?
2010-09-15T04:43:59  <ShadeS> just the fleet #, yes I saved
2010-09-15T04:44:06  <vizier> EvGenius: not sure how to copy out of cygwin
2010-09-15T04:45:18  <ShadeS> what's wrong?
2010-09-15T04:46:16  <vizier> me?
2010-09-15T04:46:26  <EvGenius> vizier: try clicking the small icon on the left side of the command window title. then in the menu try something like "change" => "select all"
2010-09-15T04:46:40  <EvGenius> vizier: then select the text and press enter
2010-09-15T04:46:59  <ShadeS> sinan: any other ideas?
2010-09-15T04:47:44  <vizier> there is a menu?
2010-09-15T04:48:01  <sinan> ShadeS: in my experience, when this happens it is just normally something very trivial that you forgot, for example, you might have 2 copies of the source code; you are editing one of them but compiling another one
2010-09-15T04:48:13  <vizier> EvGenius: Got it
2010-09-15T04:48:20  <ShadeS> I have one instance of codeblocks open
2010-09-15T04:48:24  <sinan> ShadeS: while in the folder where you ran g++, use "less" to check the source code of mybot.cc
2010-09-15T04:48:36  <sinan> ShadeS: yeah, but you are invoking g++ from cygwin, right?
2010-09-15T04:48:47  <sinan> ShadeS: maybe you are editing files elsewhere :)
2010-09-15T04:49:03  <whiteside> ShadeS, this is a huge shot in the dark, but try adding several lines of comments to your source file and then save it again... like give it an extra hundred bytes or so. Then recompile
2010-09-15T04:49:19  <vizier> EvGenius: How to send you a private message on here?
2010-09-15T04:49:21  <whiteside> I have some completely unfounded suspicions about code::blocks
2010-09-15T04:49:22  <ShadeS> sinan: I'm running g++ from the command line
2010-09-15T04:49:33  <vizier> EvGenius: dont want to just paste
2010-09-15T04:50:19  <sinan> ShadeS: great. in the command line, write "less mybot.cc" (i think windows has the "less" command)
2010-09-15T04:50:28  <EvGenius> vizier: depends on the type of your IRC client
2010-09-15T04:50:33  <sinan> ShadeS: it should show you the content of mybot.cc inside the command prompt
2010-09-15T04:50:48  <Cyndre> dualbot 91/100, ragebot 98/100 - code uploaded and I am off to sleep - good end to the night
2010-09-15T04:50:51  <sinan> ShadeS: this way you can confirm the file you are compiling actually includes the changes :)
2010-09-15T04:50:53  <EvGenius> vizier: you can use http://pastebin.com/
2010-09-15T04:50:55  <vizier> EvGenius: I'm using Webchat :( and i cant find a thingo for it

2010-09-15T04:52:13  <ShadeS> i didn't verify it actually works yet
2010-09-15T04:52:39  <EvGenius> vizier: I think you need to install at least these packages: gcc, binutils, w32 or win32-something
2010-09-15T04:52:41  <sinan> Guys, do any of you try to run their bot against itself? I found that this is helps in finding hidden assumptions you might have made :)

2010-09-15T05:15:12  * whiteside hatches a plan to launch an anti-server, wherein more planets faster is the ultimate anti-goal, and the top rankings go to those who lose the most... The rules are that a minimum of ten ships must go out every ten turns. On the surface, it appears rather amusing... But really, it's all an attempt to divert people from the main strategy to do the exact opposite.
2010-09-15T05:15:15  <sinan> antimatroid: yeah, but it can still be useful for whatever subset of the current maps show up in the final maps :)
2010-09-15T05:15:58  <antimatroid> meh, i just assume my strategy must work for any general map
2010-09-15T05:16:03  <delt0r___> I would have though random maps would be more fun
2010-09-15T05:16:10  <delt0r___> thought
2010-09-15T05:16:23  <antimatroid> delt0r___: I agree, but the organisers didn't do that last time
2010-09-15T05:16:31  <antimatroid> at least a new set of maps including some random
2010-09-15T05:16:52  <retybok> sinan: I don't think it's cheating, but note that they may change maps for the final round
2010-09-15T05:17:02  <retybok> That's what they did last time at least
2010-09-15T05:17:17  <whiteside> I fully expect fresh random maps, myself
2010-09-15T05:17:40  <retybok> Anyways a good strategy should work on all maps
2010-09-15T05:17:48  <sinan> retybok: changed all the maps?
2010-09-15T05:18:06  <retybok> most of them at least, I don't remember exactly
2010-09-15T05:18:16  <sinan> retybok: yeah, but it might take more than 1 seconds per turn, my point is to save some time by pre-calculating some values :) still a rough idea
2010-09-15T05:18:19  <whiteside> What might really bork everyone is if they had very unrandom maps in the finals... like they spell words or something. That would probably throw a few bots off kilter
2010-09-15T05:18:44  <sinan> whiteside: the final maps are not yet guaranteed to be symmetric?
2010-09-15T05:19:06  <delt0r___> I think enoumous maps with say 16 players at once and over 1000 planets spanning 100 or more units would be way cool
2010-09-15T05:19:18  <delt0r___> in fact my random map gen does just that
2010-09-15T05:19:28  <whiteside> as far as I know, they're not guaranteed to be anything except valid maps
2010-09-15T05:20:37  <sinan> whiteside: how can you make sure a map is "fair" when it is not symmetric?
2010-09-15T05:20:59  <sinan> whiteside: maybe play it twice, each time with a different starting position?
2010-09-15T05:21:01  <delt0r___> sinan: You can't
2010-09-15T05:21:26  <delt0r___> but if you play a lot of games... its "fair" in the totals
2010-09-15T05:21:32  <whiteside> I assume if that were the case, many rounds could be played
2010-09-15T05:21:33  <sinan> delt0r___: and shouldn't the organizers try to make the contest fair? :)
2010-09-15T05:22:02  <delt0r___> But a single game being unfair is not the same as the contest being unfair
2010-09-15T05:22:02  <sinan> delt0r___, whiteside: yeah, i see the point. it adds some overhead though; having to play more games
2010-09-15T05:22:17  <whiteside> that's the beauty of this sort of contest between programs vs. real hyoonims; it's trivial to run, say, a hundred matches quickly
2010-09-15T05:22:22  <retybok> delt0r___: someone should set up a server with large maps
2010-09-15T05:22:31  <delt0r___> and how well does a bot do in cases where it is at a disadvantage?
2010-09-15T05:22:35  <retybok> although more than two players would require substantial changes
2010-09-15T05:22:35  <delt0r___> its interesting
2010-09-15T05:22:51  <retybok> I think my bot would be quite good at that :)
2010-09-15T05:22:53  <delt0r___> retybok: My code can handel it

2010-09-15T06:02:08  <boegel> is it specified somewhere what is exactly needed in the ZIP file?
2010-09-15T06:02:11  <ShadeS> Naktibalda: I think I'll stick with c++
2010-09-15T06:02:16  <Naktibalda> sinan: I hope so too. I'm waiting for PHP support
2010-09-15T06:02:20  <ShadeS> as I know even less about java and python
2010-09-15T06:02:27  <boegel> of course, the bot's code is, but also additional files to get it to compile and such?
2010-09-15T06:03:31  <sinan> boegel: whatever is needed to compile your files
2010-09-15T06:03:40  <EvGenius> boegel: what additional files do you need?
2010-09-15T06:03:51  <sinan> boegel: that's normally your code, and things like the panetwars class
2010-09-15T06:04:17  <Naktibalda> is here a some naming convention? how do they know what files to compile?
2010-09-15T06:04:31  <EvGenius> yes, there is
2010-09-15T06:05:24  <sinan> Naktibalda: they compile all files that are ".<extension>", then link all of them together
2010-09-15T06:06:09  <sinan> Naktibalda, boegel: check "Do we have to submit PlanetWars.java/ PlanetWars.cc" in http://ai-contest.com/faq.php
2010-09-15T06:06:12  <EvGenius> Your main code file must be called MyBot.ext, where ext is java, cc, or whatever the standard extension for code files in your language is. Remember to include all the code files that your entry needs.
2010-09-15T06:07:33  <boegel> sinan: k, great, thx

2010-09-15T06:15:16  <ShadeS> i'm searching for the string production and it's not finding it in that file
2010-09-15T06:15:56  <ShadeS> do you see it in there?

2010-09-15T06:18:22  <ShadeS> planetwars.java does but not planetwars.cc...
2010-09-15T06:18:34  <Baphomet> correct
2010-09-15T06:18:39  <Baphomet> it was never implemented for c++
2010-09-15T06:19:13  <Naktibalda> right, Baphomet  can help about c++
2010-09-15T06:19:23  <ShadeS> oh
2010-09-15T06:19:52  <Baphomet> but the function in java is pw.Production(1) for player 1 and will return total population of all planets
2010-09-15T06:20:02  <Baphomet> owned by that player
2010-09-15T06:20:32  <Baphomet> i tried to copy java and covert the code to c++ and add it into the headers but it was all like: no you cant do that/ your doing it wrong
2010-09-15T06:20:32  <ShadeS> when I change number of fleets and I run it initially there is a stream of ships heading to the same planet. I can change this by doing?
2010-09-15T06:21:26  <Baphomet> well thats because in the single turn, it keeps the same dest and if you have set it to allow multiple active fleets it will send however mant is possible
2010-09-15T06:22:06  <Naktibalda> oh, is a streaming feature built-in in C++ package?
2010-09-15T06:22:30  <Baphomet> streaming?
2010-09-15T06:22:35  <ShadeS> where it finds the strongest planet.. if I have 4 fleets out for my first turn, can it be possible to find the next strongest planet after the first to have them all go to separate locations?
2010-09-15T06:22:55  <Baphomet> yes that is possible but will require some more coding
2010-09-15T06:23:00  <ShadeS> in a single turn
2010-09-15T06:23:03  <Baphomet> yea
2010-09-15T06:23:26  <Baphomet> just reuse the code to find dest and modify it to how you want inside of a loop
2010-09-15T06:23:58  <ShadeS> ok i'm going to look at that when i wake up then
2010-09-15T06:24:20  <ShadeS> I've gotten farther than I anticipated tonight
2010-09-15T06:25:41  <Naktibalda> OMG, my bot won against bartwe.7.8.1 once, in 300 turns

2010-09-15T06:33:21  <Baphomet> stealing main planet is a hell cheap strat tho hehehehe
2010-09-15T06:34:47  <Naktibalda> yep, I think it's a good idea to atack his planet on the first turn, you ether gain a lot or it's a draw in ship count
2010-09-15T06:35:26  <Naktibalda> unless enemy is far away and around starting planet are a lot of cheap planets for expansion
2010-09-15T06:39:12  <Naktibalda> it would be possible to get a symetric game if both bots use this tactic all game :)

2010-09-15T07:19:42  <Baphomet> so dont run cygwin?
2010-09-15T07:20:13  <Baphomet> everything works in windows as well as linux
2010-09-15T07:20:14  <vizier> im running tcp.c
2010-09-15T07:20:15  <odinsbane> vizier: by double clicking on it?  or from a bash shell or from a cmd prompt.
2010-09-15T07:20:27  <Baphomet> vizier im using tcp.c in windows with no issues
2010-09-15T07:20:40  <vizier> odinsbane: i just double clicked on it
2010-09-15T07:21:11  <EvGenius> vizier: so, did you found cygwin1.dll?
2010-09-15T07:21:12  <odinsbane> vizier: where did you install cygwin?  ie C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll should exist.
2010-09-15T07:21:58  <vizier> wait it does exist...
2010-09-15T07:22:07  <vizier> how should i be running tcp then?
2010-09-15T07:22:14  <odinsbane> vizier: try running it from a bash prompt
2010-09-15T07:22:14  <vizier> EvGenius: i found it
2010-09-15T07:22:15  <Baphomet> vizier: check pm
2010-09-15T07:24:06  <eburnette> What's with all the sha16x bots?
2010-09-15T07:24:19  <EvGenius> vizier: copy this dll into the directory with tcp.exe
2010-09-15T07:24:42  <EvGenius> vizier: so it's guaranteed it'll find it
2010-09-15T07:25:10  <odinsbane> EvGenius: He has the dll already, its probably better if he doesn't mix them.
2010-09-15T07:25:43  <EvGenius> odinsbane: but for some reason when he runs tcp.exe it says it can't find dll
2010-09-15T07:25:52  <odinsbane> EvGenius: plus he is going to need to run it with cmd line parameters its probably best if he just goes to an xterm and runs the program. vizier
2010-09-15T07:26:28  <odinsbane> EvGenius: because he is double clicking on it.  Your right he could copy the dll to the directory to be able to double click on it, but then how does he pass the cmd line options?
2010-09-15T07:28:35  <EvGenius> odinsbane: sure, he'll need command line anyway
2010-09-15T07:28:58  <vizier> im using command line anyway now
2010-09-15T07:30:18  <Baphomet> for anyone else that wants the compiled tcp.c in .class (works with java in windows) form http://baphomet.dontexist.com/tcp.class
2010-09-15T07:31:33  <odinsbane> Baphomet: somebody wrote a java version?

2010-09-15T07:40:37  <vizier> and... it does the same thing with 2 different bots of mine
2010-09-15T07:40:41  <vizier> both of which work
2010-09-15T07:40:42  <edcba> because your tests were flawed

2010-09-15T07:41:33  <vizier> unknown
2010-09-15T07:41:45  <vizier> unknown exception
2010-09-15T07:42:02  <edcba> which language ?
2010-09-15T07:42:13  <vizier> python
2010-09-15T07:42:24  <Bobng> unknown exception?
2010-09-15T07:42:25  <edcba> can't you just catch it and save it in file ?
2010-09-15T07:42:32  <vizier> i can i guess
2010-09-15T07:42:33  <Bobng> what do you mean unknwon exception.
2010-09-15T07:42:35  <edcba> Bobng: unknown to him :)
2010-09-15T07:42:38  <Baphomet> does it start working or does it crash instantly as soon as you connect to another user?
2010-09-15T07:42:43  <Bobng> oh. thats simple.
2010-09-15T07:42:48  <Bobng> wrap your main turn function
2010-09-15T07:42:50  <Bobng> in a try/except
2010-09-15T07:42:54  <vizier> crashes instantly
2010-09-15T07:43:06  <odinsbane> vizier: how are you running it?
2010-09-15T07:43:11  <edcba> if it is same than c# client you just have to add code to handle the exception
2010-09-15T07:43:21  <Bobng> yeah
2010-09-15T07:43:23  <vizier> odinsbane: through bash
2010-09-15T07:43:25  <edcba> instead of the stupid default // Owned "handler"
2010-09-15T07:43:28  <Bobng> but if it crashes instantly
2010-09-15T07:43:40  <vizier> yeah... it shouldn't
2010-09-15T07:43:41  <Bobng> just add some logging code at the top
2010-09-15T07:43:46  <odinsbane> vizier: is the file executeable?  Do you have the #!/usr/bin/env python ?
2010-09-15T07:43:52  <Bobng> from twisted.python import log
2010-09-15T07:44:04  <Bobng> then setup a logfile and put lots of "log.msg" calls everywhere
2010-09-15T07:44:23  <ShadeS> from the code that shows me the weakest enemy or neutral planet.. how could I find the next weakest?
2010-09-15T07:44:25  <vizier> oqindsbane: yes it is
2010-09-15T07:44:40  <ShadeS> where is the information for finding out how many planets are  in the game?
2010-09-15T07:44:41  <vizier> hmm...
2010-09-15T07:44:58  <edcba> ShadeS: do a list of planet and sort them according to their strength take second in list
2010-09-15T07:44:58  <vizier> yeah but crashing instantly... there has got to be a problem somewhere....
2010-09-15T07:44:59  <odinsbane> vizier: it is also running cygwins python now and not your windows python.

2010-09-15T07:45:52  <edcba> hmm i think there is a PlanetCount() also
2010-09-15T07:46:07  <vizier> odinsbane: where is cygwins python? can i just call python?
2010-09-15T07:46:22  <odinsbane> vizier: probably, try which python and it should show you which one your using.
2010-09-15T07:46:30  <ShadeS> edcba: for c++?
2010-09-15T07:46:45  <ShadeS> edcba: ah I see
2010-09-15T07:46:45  <edcba> i guess it's same everywhere
2010-09-15T07:47:45  <vizier> odinsbane: still errors with cygwi's python

2010-09-15T09:20:02  <coventry> There is a legend at the bottom of http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getplayer?player=vortex.12 indicating that games which ended due to a timeout or disconnect will be annotated as such.  However, the game http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/canvas?game_id=1284554534|smr2-18-8|vortex.12 appears to have gone to smr2-18-8, even though vortex.12 is clearly winning on the board.  Does that mean that vortex.12 made an illegal move?  Would
2010-09-15T09:20:02  <coventry> it be possible to include an annotation for that in the server?
2010-09-15T09:20:39  <Accoun> whwre is source of PlayGame.jar ?
2010-09-15T09:21:07  <Naktibalda> I haven't seen a game marked with T or D yet
2010-09-15T09:21:52  <coventry> Huh.  I maybe that functionality hasn't been implemented, yet.  Would be nice to have.

2010-09-15T09:39:33  <dstufft> mega1: there are no limits now
2010-09-15T09:39:44  <dstufft> mega1: other then the fact the current server only has 2gb of ram
2010-09-15T09:39:51  <dstufft> so that could count as a limit
2010-09-15T09:40:00  <mega1> I remember that was what you said yesterday.
2010-09-15T09:40:50  <mega1> dstufft: I'm finishing up the common lisp starter package and it's hard to decide if there should be limit on the heap.
2010-09-15T09:41:17  <mega1> on x86-64 sbcl defaults to allocate 8G of _address space_
2010-09-15T09:41:29  <boegel> Naktibalda: I was just wondering why antimatroid stated he kicked Java off first place
2010-09-15T09:41:33  <mega1> of course, it's up to the bot how much it uses of that.
2010-09-15T09:41:39  <dstufft> mega1: i don't know a lot about lisp but we won't be limiting AS again
2010-09-15T09:41:49  <dstufft> if the most we'll do is limit RSS or whatever
2010-09-15T09:42:06  <odinsbane> boegel: because when tracer had a loss, he was no longer number 1, he was not below who he lost to.
2010-09-15T09:42:13  <mega1> dstufft: that's also important to know

2010-09-15T09:43:09  <dstufft> mega1: atm theres no plans to limit memory, and atm to my knowledge we are only running 1 game at a time
2010-09-15T09:43:47  <mega1> so if my opponent hogs the memory I'm at the mercy of the kernel?
2010-09-15T09:44:05  <odinsbane> how much memory could one of these programs require?
2010-09-15T09:44:44  <Naktibalda> shouldn't a bot be disqualified for such behaviour if it's intentional
2010-09-15T09:45:02  <mega1> I don't care if it's intentional.
2010-09-15T09:45:18  <dstufft> mega1: currently, i suppose we could limit RSS, if its intentional it would be DQ'd though i believe, since disruptions are against the rules
2010-09-15T09:45:28  <dstufft> i just woke up so bear with me :p
2010-09-15T09:46:10  <Naktibalda> well, I don't think that any sane bot could use >1G of memory
2010-09-15T09:46:17  <mega1> ok, I'll put a 1G limit on the heap for now. It seems that no should go above that.
2010-09-15T09:46:33  <mega1> *no bot

2010-09-15T09:47:28  <dstufft> i don't know all the languages, i didn't realize java etc addressed like 700mb+ of shit in even an empty program
2010-09-15T09:47:36  <dstufft> so when I limited AS i killed javabots
2010-09-15T09:47:58  <dstufft> so i don't want to limit ram again without giving people a chance to look at the potetional limits

2010-09-15T09:56:24  <aerique> mega1: i think during the Tron contest they gave a --dynamic-space-size argument of 1G (or was it 512MB) to SBCL during compilation of the bot
2010-09-15T09:56:26  <dstufft> compiling is broken again
2010-09-15T09:56:48  <mega1> aerique: I set it to 768M for the time being.
2010-09-15T09:57:45  <aerique> mega1: i am not certain however if that argument to sbcl during compilation carries over to the resulting binary
2010-09-15T09:58:17  <mega1> aerique:  hmm, I have to check. There might have been some changes related to that.
2010-09-15T09:59:17  <aerique> mega1: yeah, i thought i read something to that extend on the sbcl mailinglist.  it might even be intentional
2010-09-15T09:59:42  <delt0r___> dstufft: That java stuff is all shared lib and stuff... its not "real" usage in the normal sense... but if its running in a sand box
2010-09-15T09:59:55  <dstufft> delt0r___: yea i know
2010-09-15T10:00:08  <dstufft> delt0r___: i just didnt realize Java addressed that much
2010-09-15T10:00:19  <dstufft> so when i limited address space to 196M it killed them :p
2010-09-15T10:00:26  <delt0r___> but yea.. for light weight stuff the jvm has always been on the heavy side
2010-09-15T10:02:27  <dstufft> i swear compile_daemon and compile_anything is terrible

2010-09-15T10:38:09  <delt0r___> kool, i got TCP live game visualization now.
2010-09-15T10:38:12  <mega1> some of it is stylistic/opinionated, no offense intended
2010-09-15T10:38:26  <delt0r___> but I will miss fleets that last just one turn :(
2010-09-15T10:39:04  <aerique> mega1: no problem, my style is usually "hey it compiles, ship it!" so the starter pack could use some work :)
2010-09-15T10:41:35  <mega1> aerique: they should be compatible on the server because I kept MyBot.lisp around for the server to recognize that it should do 'make' which nets it a MyBot executable.
2010-09-15T10:44:16  <dstufft> mega1: server doesn't use make files
2010-09-15T10:44:45  <mega1> the server cannot compile common lisp either
2010-09-15T10:45:06  <mega1> dstufft: not trying to be arrogant here
2010-09-15T10:45:10  <mega1> ... just being a natural.
2010-09-15T10:45:48  <mega1> Any guidelines on how make it compilable?
2010-09-15T10:45:54  <aerique> dstufft: it at least needs the info from the starter packs makefile, like in the tron challenge
2010-09-15T10:46:30  <dstufft> mega1: no worries, i don't know shit about lisp, I'm sure we'll add it once we get into the "add more languages" phase after the server stops getting stuck randomly
2010-09-15T10:46:52  <mega1> aerique: ah, it was just copied from the Makefile to some build script?
2010-09-15T10:47:09  <dstufft> currently the system looks at the source file names
2010-09-15T10:47:15  <dstufft> to determine what command to run to build it
2010-09-15T10:47:27  <dstufft> ie if MyBot.cc is there, it builds it as c++
2010-09-15T10:47:31  <mega1> yes, that's why I left MyBot.lisp around
2010-09-15T10:47:48  <mega1> although it's not even included in the final bot
2010-09-15T10:47:58  <aerique> mega1: i think so, i'm not entirely sure how things ended up on the server last challenge.  there's some reference to /usr/local/bin/make-clisp.sh in compile_all.py
2010-09-15T10:48:10  <aerique> (filenames are not exact :-) )
2010-09-15T10:48:36  <mega1> oh well, I guess they shout when they get around to it.
2010-09-15T10:49:05  <Bobng> I modified compile_anything.py
2010-09-15T10:49:05  <dstufft> if it's part of compile_anything.py already likely the only thing we need to do is install any OS packages required
2010-09-15T10:49:09  <Bobng> so it is more flexible
2010-09-15T10:49:19  <dstufft> and add it to the languages db
2010-09-15T10:49:30  <dstufft> Bobng: does yours blow up randomly
2010-09-15T10:49:37  <Bobng> nope.
2010-09-15T10:49:39  <dstufft> yay

2010-09-15T10:52:01  <Bobng> but yeah, my patch should stop all the random blowing up issues if someone includes it.
2010-09-15T10:52:05  <Cyndre> server down again?
2010-09-15T10:52:18  <Bobng> I want it to be included because i'm pretty proud of it, its got some nice abstractions
2010-09-15T10:52:29  <dstufft> Cyndre: compile daemon blew up
2010-09-15T10:52:36  <dstufft> i fixed it 50 minutes ago

2010-09-15T10:52:54  <dstufft> Bobng: i'll take a look in a bit
2010-09-15T10:53:16  <Cyndre> awsome
2010-09-15T10:54:16  <Bobng> needs some testing though
2010-09-15T10:54:30  <Bobng> but it shouldn't blow up. hundreds of if statements in a function is never a good thing -_-
2010-09-15T10:54:43  <Naktibalda> can it be worse than a current version? :)

2010-09-15T11:19:15  <jmcarthur> TapewormGalactos: my best guess is that your bot is doing something illegal as soon as it sees that the game is in the bag
2010-09-15T11:19:22  <dstufft> TapewormGalactos: do you have anything that casues a crash when you "win"
2010-09-15T11:19:34  <TapewormGalactos> I don't think so
2010-09-15T11:19:38  <TapewormGalactos> what could that be?
2010-09-15T11:19:44  <dstufft> ie enemy_planets[0] (there are no enemy_plants)
2010-09-15T11:19:47  <dstufft> or things of that nature
2010-09-15T11:20:00  <jmcarthur> for example, it's easy to just stop playing when it's clear that you win sometimes

2010-09-15T12:33:01  <McLeopold> I'm amazed at this game.
2010-09-15T12:34:38  <damag> I think you would have lost that on the official server
2010-09-15T12:34:48  <McLeopold> how's that?
2010-09-15T12:34:51  <damag> Since it's limited to 200 turns
2010-09-15T12:35:04  <damag> And it seems like you had less ships on turn 200
2010-09-15T12:35:06  <McLeopold> oh, is that official yet?
2010-09-15T12:35:35  <damag> I'm not sure, but it's been that way for a while
2010-09-15T12:35:37  <McLeopold> It's less impressive if deepblue just stops trying at 200.
2010-09-15T12:36:08  <damag> Ya I'm wondering if his logic changes based on turn number or something
2010-09-15T12:36:16  <damag> But either way, good job =)

2010-09-15T12:47:08  <jmcarthur> maiden: i think it's Janzert1 who has created a guide to setting up a clone of the official server somewhere. it's somebody whose name starts with a J anyway
2010-09-15T12:47:12  <bartwe_> smr: bruteforcing parameters on benzedrine ?

2010-09-15T12:49:57  <jmcarthur> maiden: don't forget the existence of http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/ if that's appropriate
2010-09-15T12:50:11  <McLeopold> rogue780: did you ever get your htdocs working?

2010-09-15T12:50:20  <Naktibalda> sexist
2010-09-15T12:50:48  <rogue780> maiden, and if you need a pre-compiled tcp client for windows for the server at benzedrine, I put one together at www.errgaming.com/tcp.zip
2010-09-15T12:50:48  <bartwe_> Nak: there are alot of them, and the names suggest that the onwer is trying out two parameter spaces

2010-09-15T12:50:59  <rogue780> you?
2010-09-15T12:51:17  <Naktibalda> what kind of parameters?
2010-09-15T12:51:26  <bartwe_> it doesn;t say
2010-09-15T12:51:28  <McLeopold> No, I started programming my bot after benz was back up
2010-09-15T12:51:57  <McLeopold> I got the server working, but I'm not sure about results files.
2010-09-15T12:51:59  <bartwe_> McLeo: good bot btw
2010-09-15T12:52:19  <rogue780> McLeopold, same here. people can play on it and see if they win or lose, but that's about it
2010-09-15T12:52:20  <McLeopold> Thanks, I credit it to all my loses against you.
2010-09-15T12:52:32  <bartwe_> you seem to be winning recently
2010-09-15T12:52:46  <McLeopold> A fake win against deepblue.
2010-09-15T12:52:58  <rogue780> does greghaynes's qt client do a visualiztion of the game? If so, combining it with our servers might actually make them useful
2010-09-15T12:53:04  <a1k0n> i don't know that deepblue really gave up there.
2010-09-15T12:53:17  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: yeah it looks like deepblue started dropping in numbers within one turn of 200
2010-09-15T12:53:18  <a1k0n> he had a numbers advantage but not a growth advantage just prior to 200
2010-09-15T12:53:20  <maiden> ok. but i am trying to start an replica of the current server; with web interface and all. it will have more then 20 users.
2010-09-15T12:53:33  <jmcarthur> looks like a giveup to me, personally
2010-09-15T12:53:46  <McLeopold> there was a critical abandonment of a 5 planet in his heartland
2010-09-15T12:54:04  <jmcarthur> keeping in mind that deepblue has a search algorithm which probably uses the 200 turn limit to keep things a bit more realistic
2010-09-15T12:54:42  <jmcarthur> maiden: yeah Janzert1's thing would help if you can get a hold of him
2010-09-15T12:54:44  <McLeopold> Yea, I have no turn limit logic.  I was waiting for official word.
2010-09-15T12:55:09  <jmcarthur> i will have turn limit dependent code. i'll just keep changing it until the number is fixed somewhere
2010-09-15T12:55:39  <jmcarthur> and probably will have a different version of my bot for benzedrine.cx than from the official server
2010-09-15T12:56:29  <McLeopold> That way when you do submit, you can say "I'm not left handed!"
2010-09-15T12:57:14  <rogue780> sorry for such a stupid question, but how would a turn limit impact your bot's decision making?

2010-09-15T13:00:59  <jmcarthur> haskell people: this is completely untested, but... http://jake.devio.us/starter/PlanetWars.html
2010-09-15T13:01:01  <maiden> Janzert1 are you here?
2010-09-15T13:01:01  <bartwe_> too strong protection logix i guess
2010-09-15T13:01:42  <jmcarthur> i'm hoping it doesn't have too many bugs
2010-09-15T13:02:00  <jmcarthur> the parsing and IO is tested (a little). the game engine logic is not at all tested
2010-09-15T13:02:23  <jmcarthur> dang, i don't export enough stuff
2010-09-15T13:02:30  <jmcarthur> okay i have a few more changes to make :)
2010-09-15T13:02:38  <a1k0n> jmcarthur: i haven't thought through it yet.  heh.  i'm going to just shut up and get a bot together.
2010-09-15T13:03:01  <a1k0n> i have something in mind now, but i worry it'll be way too conservative.  we'll see.
2010-09-15T13:03:19  <jmcarthur> yeah, i still don't really have a working bot. just drafts of ideas, basically
2010-09-15T13:03:23  <McLeopold> bartwe_: I had a 60 ship advantage at turn 27.  I think that made the difference.
2010-09-15T13:03:32  <jmcarthur> this extending time period has slowed me down
2010-09-15T13:03:37  <jmcarthur> *extended
2010-09-15T13:03:42  <jmcarthur> not that that's a bad thing
2010-09-15T13:03:48  <jmcarthur> it's given me some time to breathe
2010-09-15T13:04:20  <bartwe_> McLeo: yep, still counting where you got that advantage
2010-09-15T13:04:42  <num1_> what's the new time limit? it's always been 200 right?
2010-09-15T13:05:11  <a1k0n> it's 300 on benzedrine.cx
2010-09-15T13:05:13  <jmcarthur> num1_: it was 100 before, now it's 200, benzedrine uses 300, none of it is concrete
2010-09-15T13:05:19  <bartwe_> Only way to create a difference in fleet is to attack neutrals and to have a different growth rate
2010-09-15T13:06:11  <McLeopold> bartwe_: you got to the 14 planet first and got 3 ships up on me at 12...
2010-09-15T13:06:34  <bartwe_> yep
2010-09-15T13:06:39  <McLeopold> bartwe_: the small 14 planet
2010-09-15T13:06:41  *** hornairs <hornairs!~hornairs@142.157.132.122> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-15T13:06:42  <kjeldahl> Ok, I have a first bot ready. It's written in clojure, meaning it runs as a jar file. It's more than 2 megabyte (close to 4) due to having clojure embedded. Anybody know if I can still play?
2010-09-15T13:06:59  <McLeopold> bartwe_: I spent time annoying your 5 growth planet.
2010-09-15T13:07:55  <bartwe_> step 16 i guess was critical
2010-09-15T13:08:21  <bartwe_> going from -3 to +7
2010-09-15T13:08:27  <jmcarthur> it's so hard to analyze these compared to tron
2010-09-15T13:09:16  <bartwe_> intuition seems to work for the simpler tactical bits
2010-09-15T13:09:26  <McLeopold> bartwe_: If you defend better, then you don't have ships for attack.  It's a tradeoff.
2010-09-15T13:09:43  <jmcarthur> defense is great when you have the upper hand already
2010-09-15T13:09:44  <bartwe_> McL: it should have been a standoff
2010-09-15T13:09:52  <jmcarthur> especially if you have better growth
2010-09-15T13:09:58  <jmcarthur> defense is not so great if you are behind anyway
2010-09-15T13:10:08  <bartwe_> defense is useless if your behind
2010-09-15T13:10:27  <jmcarthur> i wouldn't say useless. just don't focus on it
2010-09-15T13:10:28  <bartwe_> but whats defense but the capturing of a future enemy planet ?
2010-09-15T13:10:42  <bartwe_> i never programmed any defense
2010-09-15T13:10:46  <jmcarthur> if it means the difference between keeping and losing a 5-growth, you should hold on to it
2010-09-15T13:11:10  <jmcarthur> the downside to defense is that it's hard to counter-attack in this game
2010-09-15T13:11:23  <bartwe_> war is zerosum in this thing
2010-09-15T13:11:33  <jmcarthur> there is so much time to prepare for an incoming attack
2010-09-15T13:11:36  <bartwe_> its more about exposure
2010-09-15T13:11:55  <bartwe_> growthrate is everything
2010-09-15T13:11:59  <jmcarthur> absolutely

2010-09-15T13:20:10  <Zannick> i mean, i had a really bad idea earlier
2010-09-15T13:20:17  <amstan_> lol
2010-09-15T13:20:21  <amstan_> there's like 20 ppl left in csc
2010-09-15T13:20:23  <jmcarthur> Naktibalda: a1k0n won the last contest and got tons of recruiters chasing him down
2010-09-15T13:20:32  <McLeopold> It's kinda fun this way.  Afterward a suppose we can all collaborate for the best bot ever.
2010-09-15T13:20:41  <Zannick> which ended up being the equivalent of assuming there'd be one fleet per turn per planet
2010-09-15T13:20:50  <odinsbane> idea #1, don't let your bot crash, that should get you pretty good rankings on ai-contest.com.
2010-09-15T13:20:57  <a1k0n> i never did find out what hebbie was doing with this tron bot which eventually destroyed mine after the contest on benzedrine.cx
2010-09-15T13:21:10  <jmcarthur> probably overfit to your bot :P
2010-09-15T13:21:27  <jmcarthur> exploited just one particular flaw or something
2010-09-15T13:21:30  <a1k0n> Janzert1's bot was also way, way better at the max-path-length problem
2010-09-15T13:21:57  <a1k0n> my bot had to assume everyone else was as bad as it was at that
2010-09-15T13:21:57  <jmcarthur> my bot was erratic when it came to filling spaces
2010-09-15T13:22:11  <jmcarthur> except when it was about halfway done
2010-09-15T13:22:20  <jmcarthur> then it would be like "oh crap i've been screwing up" and try to recover
2010-09-15T13:22:22  <a1k0n> the problem with alpha-beta is you can't get away with underestimating/overestimating asymmetrically
2010-09-15T13:22:29  <a1k0n> heh
2010-09-15T13:22:30  <bartwe_> mine did worse, disqualified for failing to enter the contest

2010-09-15T13:23:21  <jmcarthur> i thought mine was interesting for having a completely different approach from most others, but i never worked out all the kinks
2010-09-15T13:23:26  <a1k0n> bartwe_: you didn't know about the tron contest?  i guess we had previously corresponded on irc re: mario ai and icfp?
2010-09-15T13:23:33  <jmcarthur> mine would win where others wouldn't, and lose where others would have probably won
2010-09-15T13:23:34  <bartwe_> yep
2010-09-15T13:23:47  <bartwe_> yeah the tron thing intersected with moving houses

2010-09-15T13:28:01  <a1k0n> yes, i measure the diameter of the universe in turns
2010-09-15T13:28:07  <Zannick> fleets travel at the speed of light
2010-09-15T13:28:19  <a1k0n> or the speed of fleets anyway
2010-09-15T13:28:37  <a1k0n> space is also slightly convex
2010-09-15T13:28:40  <Zannick> well, and the planets are $dist light-turns apart
2010-09-15T13:28:51  <bartwe_> also has implications for determining threat to a planet

2010-09-15T13:45:37  <jmcarthur> rogue780: i don't know what bartwe_ uses, but it looks like a minimal spanning tree to me
2010-09-15T13:45:42  <bartwe_> basicly after alot of other steps the 'free' population of a planet is decided, if it is above a threshold compared to its 'parent' planet, it sends it to the parent
2010-09-15T13:46:49  <bartwe_> maybe is should make it a loop

2010-09-15T13:46:56  <jmcarthur> ha
2010-09-15T13:46:59  <jmcarthur> that would be scary

2010-09-15T13:47:38  <McLeopold> ha ha
2010-09-15T13:48:18  <bartwe_> rogue: actually, losing fleets is a positive move if your in a numerical advantage
2010-09-15T13:49:14  <jmcarthur> if by "losing fleets" you mean "investing fleets"

2010-09-15T13:52:10  <odinsbane> Especially if you wait, then your opponent might invest in them for you.

2010-09-15T13:57:05  <odinsbane> I just sorta smear distance/numships and growth into a number.
2010-09-15T13:57:14  <bartwe_> t = neutralforce div growth is what it takes to get neuytral
2010-09-15T13:57:48  <bartwe_> but that means both a fleet 'invested for distance +- t and that the enmey has a lower cost to take it
2010-09-15T13:57:49  <bartwe_> so maybe t = distance + neutral * 2 / growth ?
2010-09-15T13:57:51  <Naktibalda> does enybody use unit tests for bot programming?

2010-09-15T13:58:43  <bartwe_> Nak: not me
2010-09-15T13:59:43  <jmcarthur> i would test properties of my code if i actually took the time to devise a simple model for it
2010-09-15T14:00:15  <jmcarthur> (which i may actually do)
2010-09-15T14:00:33  <odinsbane> I was trying to thing of it as a return.  How many turns does it take before their is a yield.
2010-09-15T14:00:52  <caytchen> exactly one, its growth.
2010-09-15T14:00:56  <odinsbane> bartwe_:  where do you get the factor of 2 from?  Does that have to do if it is in enemy hands?
2010-09-15T14:01:09  <jmcarthur> my bot will take a lot of upfront investment in terms of data structures, but my idea has the benefit that i don't have to think about such things as the cost of taking a neutral
2010-09-15T14:01:16  <jmcarthur> or at least i don't have to think so deeply about it
2010-09-15T14:01:22  <bartwe_> odinsbane: that a fudge factor, its higher then 1 atleast, not sure yet how to determine it
2010-09-15T14:01:59  <jmcarthur> neutral have a lower cost if you know that the enemy can't simply take it after you invest
2010-09-15T14:02:13  <jmcarthur> that is, neutral costs less if you are also attacking the enemy as you expand
2010-09-15T14:02:21  <bartwe_> odins: its a factor to ensure that t is high enough to make an enemy snipe value neutral or positive
2010-09-15T14:02:25  <jmcarthur> because that makes it harder for them to take your neutral
2010-09-15T14:03:25  <bartwe_> you could deduct from tby sending a bigger force if you have superior numbers
2010-09-15T14:03:40  <Cyndre> my bot is doing alot better now :)
2010-09-15T14:03:41  <bartwe_> assuming that supresses an initial snipe
2010-09-15T14:04:00  <jmcarthur> closed-form solutions are nice, but not likely in this case
2010-09-15T14:04:04  <caytchen> bartwe_: so do you handle that more carefully now?
2010-09-15T14:04:05  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getplayer?player=Cyndre
2010-09-15T14:04:07  <odinsbane> How about calculations, do you limit yourself based on time?  It seems like 1 second is a long time.
2010-09-15T14:04:35  <jmcarthur> the time limit is going to be my biggest hurdle
2010-09-15T14:04:51  <bartwe_> caythen: haven't implemented this yet
2010-09-15T14:05:11  <bartwe_> just thinking about heuristics for a decision
2010-09-15T14:05:31  <bartwe_> i do need a better way to determine whcih neutral to attack
2010-09-15T14:05:39  <bartwe_> if any
2010-09-15T14:05:55  <bartwe_> especially knowning which neutral not to attack would be good :)

2010-09-15T14:29:44  <eburnette> How come some planets have 0 growth rate? Is that normal?

2010-09-15T14:30:37  <eburnette> interesting, can you think of a reason why i'd want to take over a 0 growth planet?
2010-09-15T14:30:52  <justin_pdx> The zero growth planets were confusing to me at first.  On the viewer they don't show up, they're just a black hole with a population.

2010-09-15T14:31:51  <deepblue> you would only ever want to attack one to kill an enemy fleet stationed on it
2010-09-15T14:31:52  <justin_pdx> On map1 in the demo packages there is a zero growth planet smack in the middle of the map with a ring around it.  It might be a strategic place to pile up ships since they could go anywhere on the map faster than any other place on the map.
2010-09-15T14:32:03  <deepblue> ^^
2010-09-15T14:33:15  <jmcarthur> bartwe_: the spec is incorrect (regarding the 3 second first turn). i have submitted a patch for it
2010-09-15T14:33:20  <jmcarthur> bartwe_: each turn is only 1 second, in reality
2010-09-15T14:33:31  <eburnette> I was thinking of unowned zero growth planets, justin_pdx that makes sense
2010-09-15T14:33:47  <Cyndre> is there a link the greghaynes visualizer/tcp server client
2010-09-15T14:33:55  <rogue780> anyway, i gotta take some trash to the dump and then mow the lawn. i'll be back in a few hours

2010-09-15T14:34:01  <justin_pdx> But that would take geographic strategic reasoning to evaluate the worth of a zero growth planet and I'm no where near that.  I'm still trying to figure out how to maximize growth without thought of winning.
2010-09-15T14:34:10  <rogue780> the greghaynes tcp client doesn't work on windows AFAIK

2010-09-15T14:35:02  <jmcarthur> it's a qt app. qt works on windows. you probably just have to change something fairly minor

2010-09-15T14:46:18  <justin_pdx> Can you download the source for bots you want to play against?  Like, could I get bartwe's bot or is that part of the contest, that your code can be a secret if you want it to be.
2010-09-15T14:47:49  <caytchen> i don't think it works that way heh
2010-09-15T14:49:01  <delt0r> thats what galcon reminds me of ...
2010-09-15T14:49:08  <delt0r> Netrek
2010-09-15T14:49:12  <eburnette> how about jar files without the source, would that be any safer?
2010-09-15T14:49:13  <delt0r> but simpler
2010-09-15T14:49:33  <eburnette> Netrek was fun back in the day
2010-09-15T14:50:11  <Zannick> not all bots compile to jar files
2010-09-15T14:50:44  <delt0r> justin_pdx, the best way to play other bots outside the offical board is the tcp server
2010-09-15T14:51:24  <justin_pdx> Playing them would be cool.  But looking at their source would be cooler.
2010-09-15T14:51:58  <delt0r> justin_pdx, yea--I will be making my source more or less available...
2010-09-15T14:52:14  <delt0r> but i don't expect to win... and I have stronger constraints than the rules
2010-09-15T14:52:33  <delt0r> first of all there is no way i want to be taking a whole second
2010-09-15T14:52:43  <justin_pdx> delt0r:
2010-09-15T14:52:55  <justin_pdx> delt0r: What do you mean, stronger constraints than the rules?
2010-09-15T14:53:04  <delt0r> Well i am writing a RTS
2010-09-15T14:53:10  <delt0r> I am up to the AI part
2010-09-15T14:53:12  <boegel> is there like a open repository of bots by other people, i.e. bots that are smarter than the example bots?
2010-09-15T14:53:18  <delt0r> this is a good way to test ideas
2010-09-15T14:53:38  <delt0r> But i can't burn the cpu like  a bot thats built to win

2010-09-15T14:56:20  <deepblue> ;)
2010-09-15T14:56:20  <mightybyte> Anyone else here think that the spec should state a limit for the number of planets?
2010-09-15T14:56:20  <delt0r> clearly there will be differences/
2010-09-15T14:56:47  <delt0r> mightybyte, it should be either 42 or "heap"
2010-09-15T14:57:10  <eburnette> Argh! I hate it when my bot just stops for no reason and no error
2010-09-15T15:00:01  <justin_pdx> eburnette: The biggest no-error I found was that my planets were trying to issue orders that would send more ships from that planet per turn than they had.  That causes you to forfeit.
2010-09-15T15:00:29  <delt0r> justin_pdx, But usually with a message? no
2010-09-15T15:01:02  <justin_pdx> I am using java and when I run the commands to test my bot against a test bot the game runner doesn't give any output except that the enemy wins.
2010-09-15T15:01:13  <Zannick> the biggest error i am finding is trying to send negative ships from a planet
2010-09-15T15:01:35  <Zannick> i believe this arises from having negative ships on a planet, but i don't know how that happened
2010-09-15T15:02:10  <eburnette> I changed the IssueOrder function to test for bad parameters and print an error
2010-09-15T15:02:25  <delt0r> justin_pdx, Well once i release my player... you be pleased to note that it will redirect the err stream and give you message... like "we know who you are hax0r --cheater"
2010-09-15T15:02:38  <delt0r> thats code for an illegal fleet command
2010-09-15T15:02:47  <eburnette> but of course I got the compare backwards, doh
2010-09-15T15:03:12  <delt0r> assert is your friend
2010-09-15T15:03:34  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: not IMO. does it really affect you that drastically?
2010-09-15T15:03:34  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~scott@67.139.105.186> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2010-09-15T15:03:58  <Zannick> assert will kill your bot and cause it to timeout and be dc'ed
2010-09-15T15:04:28  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: i am open to being convinced
2010-09-15T15:04:52  <delt0r> jmcarthur, the more planets... the more the game is about expansion
2010-09-15T15:04:57  <a1k0n> a maximum number of planets and maximum distance between planets would constrain the problem a bit
2010-09-15T15:04:59  <delt0r> and only expansion
2010-09-15T15:05:15  <delt0r> so i can see a point
2010-09-15T15:05:21  <delt0r> the point
2010-09-15T15:05:21  <a1k0n> i mean it seems to be feasible to do everything in O(N^2) now but if it's not in the future then there's a problem
2010-09-15T15:05:30  <Zannick> i think i will use assert for debugging
2010-09-15T15:05:33  <delt0r> but a turn limit would be better first
2010-09-15T15:05:40  <jmcarthur> yeah i can see how it changes the value of differing goals (destory opponent vs. expand a lot)
2010-09-15T15:05:44  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: I think the running time for most people's approaches is most likely to be O(numPlanets ^ p)
2010-09-15T15:06:49  <jmcarthur> if we were to decide to constrain the number of planets then we open another avenue for bikeshedding. who wants to start? :)
2010-09-15T15:07:07  <mightybyte> If the number of planets in the final contest increased by an order of magnitude or more, it would be a completely different kind of contest.
2010-09-15T15:07:13  <delt0r> bikeshedding?
2010-09-15T15:07:28  <jmcarthur> delt0r: everybody agrees to build a bikeshed but not on what color it should be, so nothing gets done
2010-09-15T15:07:51  <mightybyte> jmcarthur: Nah, it should be a dictatorial decision.
2010-09-15T15:07:58  <delt0r> oh --you mean like  committees
2010-09-15T15:08:03  <jmcarthur> delt0r: lol yeah
2010-09-15T15:08:22  <mightybyte> I don't particularly care what the exact number is.  I just think it should be stated somewhere.
2010-09-15T15:08:27  <delt0r> well first set the number of turn... 200 -400 seems good
2010-09-15T15:08:40  <jmcarthur> turns is far more important to me, yeah
2010-09-15T15:08:43  <delt0r> then you can't have big maps cus you won't be able to get there
2010-09-15T15:09:13  <delt0r> and the server is already loaded so i don't think its practical to make the maps much bigger in size or planet count
2010-09-15T15:09:23  <mightybyte> delt0r: Turns limits map size, but not map density.
2010-09-15T15:09:34  <jmcarthur> mightybyte: to an extent they do
2010-09-15T15:09:48  <delt0r> dense maps sux like money maps in starcraft
2010-09-15T15:10:13  <jmcarthur> honestly i wish we had a few man-made maps with weird properties
2010-09-15T15:10:27  <delt0r> and everything is always at least one turn away
2010-09-15T15:10:50  <delt0r> jmcarthur, yea --you could have some funky ones
2010-09-15T15:11:03  <mightybyte> There's a post somewhere in the forums that says the number of planets will be around the same as the current maps, but I think that should be stated prominently in the spec.
2010-09-15T15:11:59  <delt0r> mightybyte, I really wouldn't worry about it. if you have something thats going to work on the 100 maps you have, the chances are that its going to just as good as everyone else with different maps
2010-09-15T15:12:14  <jmcarthur> i wrote the current spec, but as a contestant i can't make a dictatorial decision. we need an organizer to do it
2010-09-15T15:12:51  <mightybyte> delt0r: ...unless I'm using a O(n^3) algorithm which works fine now and they crank n up to several hundred for the contest.
2010-09-15T15:13:10  <jmcarthur> so if one of you guys can get an organizer to declare a number for these things, i will make a patch for the spec page
2010-09-15T15:13:20  <delt0r> mightybyte, and that going to hit *all of us* the same
2010-09-15T15:13:36  <delt0r> anyway i bet real money its not going to change that much
2010-09-15T15:13:37  <jmcarthur> delt0r: i see mightybyte's point. it affects his choice of algorithm
2010-09-15T15:13:42  <mightybyte> delt0r: True, but it creates a disincentive to make more complex algorithms now.

2010-09-15T15:13:54  <jmcarthur> same as for turn count
2010-09-15T15:13:57  <mightybyte> In my mind it essentially penalizes "better" algorithms.
2010-09-15T15:14:05  <jmcarthur> well, i dunno about "better" algorithms
2010-09-15T15:14:12  <mightybyte> Thet's why I used quotes.
2010-09-15T15:14:15  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-15T15:14:27  <jmcarthur> it penalizes a certain class of potentially better algorithms
2010-09-15T15:14:59  <delt0r> I still think your safe assuming the maps you have are representative
2010-09-15T15:15:14  <kjeldahl> Has anybody noticed any limitations regarding submitting orders? I have a bot that keeps submitting fleet orders which seems to be ignored when I get the game state back (fleet is gone).
2010-09-15T15:15:22  <mightybyte> It penalizes a class of algorithms that can reasonably considered to have a good chance of having a higher upper bound of skill. :)
2010-09-15T15:15:27  <delt0r> I would have like more diversity personally... but hay--
2010-09-15T15:15:47  <mightybyte> delt0r: You know what they say about the word "assume"...
2010-09-15T15:15:53  <delt0r> oh yea
2010-09-15T15:16:20  <delt0r> but its not really practical to change it that much...

2010-09-15T17:26:37  <edcba> yes you can between turns
2010-09-15T17:26:45  <edcba> not between matches
2010-09-15T17:26:45  <Zannick> but you will always get all the information every turn

2010-09-15T17:27:13  <amstan> dshreyas: the games take most space, so most of them were removed

2010-09-15T17:33:30  <dstufft> we've been working on getting a lot of things fixed though

2010-09-15T17:33:46  <grimm_> cool
2010-09-15T17:33:59  <dstufft> danielvf just fixed the replay database so that we store the replays in their own table, and compresses
2010-09-15T17:34:02  <grimm_> so, is this the same system you used for last year?
2010-09-15T17:34:11  <dstufft> took our db down from like 3gbs to 11mbs lol
2010-09-15T17:34:19  <grimm_> yikes
2010-09-15T17:34:23  <dstufft> er 3gb and 11mb
2010-09-15T17:34:39  <dstufft> grimm_: i don't know i wasn't around last year
2010-09-15T17:34:45  <grimm_> ah
2010-09-15T17:35:14  <dstufft> i just volunteered to help the other day when the server kept blowing up
2010-09-15T17:35:24  <zaph> Is the new match schedule running ? I notice I have played a few top-20 games recently
2010-09-15T17:35:29  <grimm_> i see
2010-09-15T17:35:37  <dstufft> and became an admin, same with danielvf
2010-09-15T17:36:04  <grimm_> and have you been able to make some headway at least?
2010-09-15T17:36:11  <dstufft> zaph: i do believe that we have a new scheduler in place, it's still not perfect imo
2010-09-15T17:36:13  <Zannick> i was helping out a lot at the beginning of the month with minor patches
2010-09-15T17:36:34  <dstufft> grimm_: yes, at the moment the server is relatively stable, a lot of the big issues are now taken care of
2010-09-15T17:36:41  <grimm_> awesome
2010-09-15T17:36:42  <Zannick> but then my time grew shorter and i determined i would not be able to contribute much more as an admin
2010-09-15T17:36:43  <dstufft> grimm_: now it's mostly edge cases that keep poping up
2010-09-15T17:36:50  <grimm_> i'm quite curious thoug
2010-09-15T17:36:54  <dhartmei> benzedrine.cx is switching game data file formats, i'll have to shut down the server for a couple of minutes, and previous game data will be lost, sorry about that.
2010-09-15T17:37:07  <grimm_> are you running all the games in qemu instances?
2010-09-15T17:37:38  <zaph> Dstfft: yeah, at least it is an improvement over random
2010-09-15T17:37:51  <dstufft> zaph: i think currently we select a random player, and then we generate a random number, 5, 10, 50, 1000 etc, and pick someone who is that number away from the random person
2010-09-15T17:39:07  <dstufft> personally i think we should pick player 1 by first getting a random player with the fewest games played, until every current submission has atleast N games (maybe 10? or 5?), and then player 2 is selected by what will increase the rankings confidence (since the ranking tries to estimate your ELO score, it's not a true ELO)

2010-09-15T17:40:07  <Zannick> that sounds like the patch danielvf made
2010-09-15T17:40:27  <dstufft> the patch i saw from danielvf, unless he's made another one
2010-09-15T17:40:27  <zaph> dstufft ok, not the one I thought they were going with, but a bit better.  I think your idea is ok but needs to also look for players with no games in x minutes to prevent starving
2010-09-15T17:40:43  <Zannick> my patch got rejected in favor of that one
2010-09-15T17:40:48  <dstufft> just selcts a random player, and then picks someone within X distance of them
2010-09-15T17:40:51  <Zannick> which is okay
2010-09-15T17:40:54  <dstufft> where X is a random number
2010-09-15T17:41:05  <zaph> People can keep submitting to jump to front of queue which is bad
2010-09-15T17:41:23  <dstufft> zaph: that's true, i didnt think about that
2010-09-15T17:41:36  <Zannick> adding that feature isn't as hard now, i believe
2010-09-15T17:41:46  <dstufft> changing the scheduler isn't hard really

2010-09-15T17:43:04  <Zannick> my method was just pick player 1 based on recent games

2010-09-15T17:43:36  <dstufft> in a way that balances new submissions getting a good number of games asap, all submissions getting a fair chance for playing games, and making the ranking system more confident

2010-09-15T17:44:29  <zaph> Zannick problem with that is I just keep submitting and going to 0 games.
2010-09-15T17:44:54  <zaph> But it is close to correct
2010-09-15T17:45:02  <Zannick> the scheduler will pick more than one game per run
2010-09-15T17:45:16  <dstufft> well the other issue is, it's nice to give more then one game to a brand new submission
2010-09-15T17:45:24  <dstufft> over someone who might have had 100 games already
2010-09-15T17:45:27  <Zannick> so even if you do that, you will only be at 0 games until your first game that run
2010-09-15T17:45:41  <zaph> Yep, just needs balance
2010-09-15T17:45:55  <Zannick> and it won't completely starve people unless they get really unlucky with that
2010-09-15T17:46:05  <Zannick> there's a lot of balance needed

2010-09-15T18:49:53  <Caffeinated> Quick q - most likely "bending" the rules, but is there anything against sending lots of fleets with just 1 attack in, to take advantage of the bots who process every fleet info? (Seems as relevant a time as any =P)
2010-09-15T18:50:22  <edcba> of course no
2010-09-15T18:50:27  <AJC> Caffeinated: I don't think it's against the rules.
2010-09-15T18:50:42  <AJC> but if you send the exact same fleets at the exact same place, then it's unsportsman :-)
2010-09-15T18:50:42  <edcba> but i doubt it is a winning strategy
2010-09-15T18:50:55  <AJC> edcba: it'll help against the non C++ bots ;-)
2010-09-15T18:51:07  <edcba> depends on how they are coded
2010-09-15T18:51:09  <mightybyte> Does PlayGame merge fleets to/from the same place on the same turn?
2010-09-15T18:51:15  <caytchen> not yet obviously
2010-09-15T18:51:21  <caytchen> the TCP server does however
2010-09-15T18:51:32  <Caffeinated> well, if the logic is there anyways, you're just sending it in bigger amounts of data
2010-09-15T18:51:35  <AJC> Caffeinated: then you'd have to work around that :-)
2010-09-15T18:51:54  <antimatroid> you wont hurt me anymore than yourself by spamming fleets :P
2010-09-15T18:52:00  <antimatroid> i've set it up to account for that
2010-09-15T18:52:21  <AJC> antimatroid: how so?
2010-09-15T18:52:23  <Caffeinated> Wasn't planning to do it.. It just occured to me after a few of the bots timed out ;)
2010-09-15T18:52:50  <delt0r_> Caffeinated: A bot just has to merge them as a direct counter
2010-09-15T18:52:51  <antimatroid> AJC: i'll leave that one as an exercise to the reader
2010-09-15T18:52:52  <edcba> i think sending at same place is "wrong"
2010-09-15T18:53:09  <edcba> else of course there is no problem sending 1 fleet at each planet
2010-09-15T18:53:14  <AJC> antimatroid: you didn't say how far ahead you were predicting, beyond the last fleet arrival.

2010-09-15T18:53:47  <Zannick> there might be memory issues
2010-09-15T18:54:22  <Zannick> the engine on benzedrine seems to send malformed state when there are many fleets
2010-09-15T18:54:35  <AJC> antimatroid: you mean your code regroups fleets going to the same place.  you still have the issue of 1-fleets sent to different places on purpose.
2010-09-15T18:54:35  <AJC> hehe
2010-09-15T18:56:12  <Caffeinated> And you'd have to adjust for different travel times, sent over a number of turns may not be the same, unless you're only caring about destination..
2010-09-15T18:56:29  <antimatroid> you don't care where a fleet is sent from, only its arrival time, you can merge any meeting that ;)
2010-09-15T18:56:42  <antimatroid> could still end up with lots of fleets, but so will everyone else

2010-09-15T19:46:40  <Cyndre> http://www.benzedrine.cx/planetwars/getratings
2010-09-15T19:46:41  <Caffeinated> ai-contest has lots of default bots... I stop watching after about 5 turns if they've only sent out one attack ;-)
2010-09-15T19:47:23  <Caffeinated> whereas if you can be bothered to set up the tcp thing, you're likely taking it a little more seriously
2010-09-15T19:47:44  <Cyndre> I want to break into the top 100
2010-09-15T19:48:14  <Caffeinated> i hit 300 earlier.. pretty impressed with it as a first attempt
2010-09-15T19:48:39  <ShadeS> I'm not ready to submit my bot yet
2010-09-15T19:48:45  <Zannick> i was in the top ten briefly
2010-09-15T19:48:47  <Zannick> ...during the beta
2010-09-15T19:48:48  <ShadeS> I'm having trouble getting it to do what i want
2010-09-15T19:49:10  <ShadeS> can you guys use functions in the code or does it all have to be nested ifs and/or for/while loops?
2010-09-15T19:49:17  <Cyndre> http://ai-contest.com/visualizer.php?game_id=4487917   I love how my bot kinda flows (not sure how to explain it)
2010-09-15T19:49:31  <Caffeinated> ShadeS I'm having that problem, mine's really good in the middle stages, but starts off badly and could kill off matches a lot quicker than it does
2010-09-15T19:49:54  <Caffeinated> And you can do whatever you want as long as it takes less than a second per turn
2010-09-15T19:50:50  <ShadeS> yeah I don't exactly know how to check for that
2010-09-15T19:50:56  <ShadeS> I have a simple solid gameplan
2010-09-15T19:51:19  <Cyndre> caffieinated: to select planets I scan all I dont own, find out cost to take them and distance away - I then use the max distance I see as my gauge and all planets are ranked as shipCost = shipCost - ((maxDist - dist) * growthRate) or something close to that
2010-09-15T19:51:19  <ShadeS> but it's weird because it's a lmost recursive in the way it works
2010-09-15T19:52:24  <Caffeinated> Cyndre: Seems a fairly solid plan, though I found that sending out my own growthrate left me open..
2010-09-15T19:53:02  <Naktibalda> sending out growth rate is useless, unless you send it to your own planet
2010-09-15T19:53:06  <Cyndre> Caffeinated: thats just the ranking part to decide which planet to take
2010-09-15T19:53:20  <Caffeinated> Cyndre I know, I was watching the link you gave
2010-09-15T19:53:29  <Cyndre> Natibalda: not true - as soon as my bot grows faster I send growth rate to enemy planet
2010-09-15T19:53:50  <Cyndre> Caffeinated: ahh, only once my bot is ahead in growth rate - and I use it absorb your growth rate
2010-09-15T19:54:27  <Cyndre> Caffeinated: if you grow 20 a turn and Im at 22 a turn Ill immediatly start attacking your planet
2010-09-15T19:55:03  <Caffeinated> Cyndre: Hadn't considered that, I'm currently finding the "best" planet based on distance, growthrate and such, then send out what I can afford to not have locally given current fleet positions
2010-09-15T19:55:40  <Caffeinated> works fairly well, except for the maps with smaller planets around, where it decides "That planet directly opposite me is growing nicely.. I'll take it"
2010-09-15T19:55:41  <Cyndre> Caffeinated: one thing I need to add is fleet evaluation on my "am I ahead code"
2010-09-15T19:56:33  <Cyndre> cool
2010-09-15T19:57:09  <Cyndre> Caffeinated: my bots worst thing is when the enemy attacks planets across the map - my bot prematurely starts attacking you while your fleet is in flight
2010-09-15T19:57:42  <Cyndre> and over reinforcing
2010-09-15T19:58:12  <Caffeinated> Cyndre: Mine developed reinforcing from nowhere.. Not a clue how either, since I'm only scanning through NotMyPlanets for targets...

2010-09-15T20:00:59  <Cyndre> couldnt kill an 11 sized planet with 250 ships
2010-09-15T20:01:38  <Caffeinated> Might work better sending out target.growthrate + 1 for when the growths are vaguely even?
2010-09-15T20:02:04  <Cyndre> if someone is around that built the visualizer - could you add a graph of ships vs ships and growthRate vs growthRate
2010-09-15T20:02:19  <Cyndre> left it with 11 ships though
2010-09-15T20:02:22  <Caffeinated> Or add something so if your planet is above 70 for example you just take your target out
2010-09-15T20:02:41  <Cyndre> not sure why it was sending like that
2010-09-15T20:03:38  <Cyndre> think I need to do a dist + 1  when I caluclate taking enemy planets
2010-09-15T20:04:51  <Zannick> there is already a ships vs ships graph

2010-09-15T20:33:36  <Cyndre> what I meant was my bot compares my growthRate and the enemys growthRate - as soon as my bot is ahead it will send all ships to 1 target enemy planet

2010-09-15T20:43:24  <Caffeinated> It's only using Google's name, they have nothing to do with it... And why should they pay you to enter a competition they're making nothing from?
2010-09-15T20:43:49  <rwa> as a way to find good candidates who can make them even more money
2010-09-15T20:44:04  <Caffeinated> At that point they'll give you money ;-)
2010-09-15T20:44:52  <joeb_> google has nothing to do with it, then why let the contest use their name?
2010-09-15T20:44:53  <Caffeinated> Few of my job interviews involved "code this" before an actual interview.. Something google's size it makes sense to make it competitive
2010-09-15T20:45:21  <Caffeinated> joeb_ publicity... coz clearly not enough CS students had heard of them....

2010-09-15T21:46:52  <Caffeinated> vulture - Pretty sure they all are symmetrical
2010-09-15T21:47:15  <jmcarthur> it's unspecified, but probably maps will be designed to be fair
2010-09-15T21:47:43  <vulture-> yeah only asking cuz I couldnt find it specified
2010-09-15T21:47:52  <amstan> vulture-: either point or line symmetric
2010-09-15T21:48:20  <jmcarthur> should that be in the spec?
2010-09-15T21:48:41  <amstan> jmcarthur: idk though..
2010-09-15T21:48:45  <jmcarthur> *should it be added to the spec, i mean
2010-09-15T21:49:04  <amstan> if we do introduce an unbalanced map, it should still even out
2010-09-15T21:49:17  <jmcarthur> would there be enough game to do that?
2010-09-15T21:49:20  <jmcarthur> i'm kind of doubtful
2010-09-15T21:49:24  <jmcarthur> *games
2010-09-15T21:49:24  <vulture-> I've done some AI contests in the past where the host decided to just use randomly generated boards, and the winner usually ended up being whoever had the random initial state advantage, whereas symmetry removed that
2010-09-15T21:49:33  <Cyndre>  I am all for non asymetric maps
2010-09-15T21:49:42  <jmcarthur> non-asymmetric :P
2010-09-15T21:49:55  <amstan> vulture-: 2 player maps?
2010-09-15T21:49:59  <vulture-> yeah
2010-09-15T21:50:02  <jmcarthur> i think we should just specify that they should be symmetrical
2010-09-15T21:50:19  <Caffeinated> 14 games per minute.... 1000 bots... not gonna be enough time to balence out the non-asymmetricless ones...
2010-09-15T21:50:21  <Snowplan> is this contest eventually gonna be multi player
2010-09-15T21:50:22  <jmcarthur> i can't see any other way to get meaningful results from the contest
2010-09-15T21:50:25  <amstan> vulture-: and how many games would each ai play?
2010-09-15T21:50:25  <vulture-> on 3+ player FFA AI games I always notice the loser is automatically chosen by whoever gets teamed up on :D
2010-09-15T21:50:27  <jmcarthur> Snowplan: not this contest
2010-09-15T21:50:37  <vulture-> I dunno, doesnt really matter
2010-09-15T21:50:43  <Snowplan> cause it seems to be set up for it
2010-09-15T21:50:58  <jmcarthur> Snowplan: there is a little untested infrastructure, but no plans to use it for this contest
2010-09-15T21:51:02  <amstan> vulture-: it does.. if it's few games there's a much higher chance that you'll get fucked by a crappy map
2010-09-15T21:51:05  <vulture-> if you're 2v1 it doesnt really matter how good your AI for the 1 is, the 2 will always beat the 1 in the upper ranks
2010-09-15T21:51:26  <amstan> vulture-: it's 1v1 all the time anyway..
2010-09-15T21:51:32  <Snowplan> ok thanks
2010-09-15T21:51:33  <vulture-> yeah so it wouldnt matter
2010-09-15T21:51:39  <jmcarthur> amstan: even if there are many games, if the map advantage determines the game 90% of the time, say, then it would take a *ton* of games to even that out
2010-09-15T21:51:49  <amstan> jmcarthur: good point
2010-09-15T21:51:51  <amstan> ok..
2010-09-15T21:51:52  <vulture-> 1v1 + symmetry --> more games played = more accurate ranking of your AI
2010-09-15T21:51:52  <amstan> well
2010-09-15T21:51:54  <amstan> put it in
2010-09-15T21:52:05  <jmcarthur> okay. i'll add it either tonight or tomorrow
2010-09-15T21:52:08  <amstan> vulture-: symmetry does not result in more games played
2010-09-15T21:52:09  <vulture-> oh I see what you're saying
2010-09-15T21:52:32  <vulture-> you're saying if you play the asymmetric maps an uneven number of times or whatever
2010-09-15T21:52:40  <amstan> it just needs more games to be accurate
2010-09-15T21:52:47  <jmcarthur> even if we always played two games between each bot, swapping positions, it wouldn't make up for the asymmetry
2010-09-15T21:52:54  *** num1_ <num1_!~num1@unaffiliated/num1> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2010-09-15T21:53:01  <Cyndre> nah, you just play two games and swap start positions
2010-09-15T21:53:03  <vulture-> I guess you could do each asymmetric map twice, just flip the initial player positions
2010-09-15T21:53:17  <jmcarthur> if the asymmetry accounts for a 90% advantage then it pretty much just means that we waste those games on a nearly predetermined outcome
2010-09-15T21:53:20  <vulture-> that'd be fine
2010-09-15T21:53:21  <amstan> vulture-: no.. if you play 1000 games on uneven maps there's a higher chance to even out the advantages/disadvantages of the map positions
2010-09-15T21:53:30  <Snowplan> Dumb ? but if I change my pw.java will it work on the contest server
2010-09-15T21:53:35  <amstan> vulture-: it it's fewer, it won't be evened out, so it'll suck
2010-09-15T21:53:48  <vulture-> 1000 might not even you out at the higher ranks
2010-09-15T21:54:03  <vulture-> the change of 500:500 advantage is pretty small
2010-09-15T21:54:07  <Cyndre> yes, when you submit you zip all the files you need and the files in the zip are used
2010-09-15T21:54:10  <jmcarthur> that is, if the asymmetry gives any X% advantage, then we might as well be just throwing away X% of the game outcomes
2010-09-15T21:54:13  <vulture-> *chance
2010-09-15T21:54:20  <Snowplan> ok thats great
2010-09-15T21:54:23  <jmcarthur> or more even
2010-09-15T21:54:25  <amstan> jmcarthur: not that much, but you're right
2010-09-15T21:54:26  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: not really, play 2 games
2010-09-15T21:54:29  <Snowplan> thought maybe it was only mybot
2010-09-15T21:54:32  <amstan> jmcarthur: fewer
2010-09-15T21:54:40  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: and swap start positions
2010-09-15T21:54:40  <jmcarthur> think about it:
2010-09-15T21:54:44  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: not sufficient
2010-09-15T21:54:44  <amstan> anyway.. put it in the specs
2010-09-15T21:54:50  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: why not?
2010-09-15T21:54:57  <amstan> jmcarthur: playing double the games with swapped positions would solve this
2010-09-15T21:55:02  <vulture-> I think you could do it by playing two games swapped
2010-09-15T21:55:11  <amstan> vulture-: that needs more games
2010-09-15T21:55:17  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: consider the case that the advantage is 99%. that means we have a 99%*99% chance that the outcome of those two games is just (1,1)
2010-09-15T21:55:20  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: pretty pointless
2010-09-15T21:55:21  <vulture-> I mean for EACH asymmetric map
2010-09-15T21:55:26  <jmcarthur> vulture-: ^^
2010-09-15T21:55:41  <amstan> jmcarthur: no..
2010-09-15T21:55:47  <vulture-> # games played overall irrelevant (more is better obviously), but for an asymmetric map, play twice with positions swapped
2010-09-15T21:55:48  <jmcarthur> why not?
2010-09-15T21:55:58  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: totally changes the dynamics and brings more then just best search tree
2010-09-15T21:55:59  <amstan> jmcarthur: you get 90% advantage the first game, then you swap the second game and gain -90% advantage
2010-09-15T21:56:01  <amstan> it evens out
2010-09-15T21:56:09  <jmcarthur> amstan: they don't just subtract like that
2010-09-15T21:56:15  <jmcarthur> each game is an independent sample
2010-09-15T21:56:26  <justin_pdx> How do you output from your bot in java?  Can you put messages in the log?
2010-09-15T21:56:27  <amstan> jmcarthur: not if you use the same map and the same bot
2010-09-15T21:56:33  <Cyndre> not really - if you play the 2 bots on the same bot over and over its identical results
2010-09-15T21:56:40  <Cyndre> er same map over
2010-09-15T21:56:47  <amstan> justin_pdx: stderr, use the modified game engine of a1k0n's design
2010-09-15T21:56:49  <jmcarthur> if in the first game you have a 90% chance of winning and in the second a 10% chance, it doesn't even out to a 50% chance overall

2010-09-15T21:58:35  <jmcarthur> most bots are not like that
2010-09-15T21:58:38  <vulture-> if it makes any difference, maybe it wont be 50:50
2010-09-15T21:58:44  <amstan> anyone have a link to the goatse map from tron?
2010-09-15T21:58:51  <jmcarthur> yeah the games even out, but it makes then less useful in determining skill
2010-09-15T21:59:03  <vulture-> actually that makes it more useful
2010-09-15T21:59:16  <vulture-> as I mentioned, [20.52.28] <vulture-> gives more AI possibilities than just symmetry
2010-09-15T21:59:21  <jmcarthur> when you have a 90%*90% chance of just getting (1,1) then you only have a 100%-90%*90% chance of getting any other result
2010-09-15T21:59:43  <vulture-> what's 90%*90%
2010-09-15T21:59:50  <jmcarthur> 81%
2010-09-15T21:59:53  <amstan> vulture-: he's kinda right..
2010-09-15T21:59:56  <vulture-> no I mean whats your number
2010-09-15T22:00:03  <jmcarthur> what other number?
2010-09-15T22:00:09  <amstan> jmcarthur: the map generator could be made so the uneveness is lower
2010-09-15T22:00:11  <vulture-> maybe you have a 90% chance of winning a "9:1 odds game", but a 20% chance of winning a "1:9 odds game"
2010-09-15T22:00:11  <jmcarthur> oh
2010-09-15T22:00:16  <vulture-> because your AIs are different
2010-09-15T22:00:27  <jmcarthur> vulture-: i'm using a theoretical advantage given to one player over the other in an asymmetrical map
2010-09-15T22:00:43  <jmcarthur> yeah sure. most AIs aren't going to do necessarily better in one situation than the other though
2010-09-15T22:00:54  <jmcarthur> we're just decreasing the signal to noise ratio
2010-09-15T22:00:58  <vulture-> thats not necessarily always the case
2010-09-15T22:01:14  *** hornairs <hornairs!~hornairs@dsl-67-204-1-88.acanac.net> has joined #aichallenge
2010-09-15T22:01:14  <jmcarthur> there might be like one or two games that a single bot plays that gives extra information in this case
2010-09-15T22:01:17  <jmcarthur> out of all of them
2010-09-15T22:01:19  <vulture-> all AIs are different
2010-09-15T22:01:23  <jmcarthur> (as a guess)
2010-09-15T22:01:24  <vulture-> its completely plausible
2010-09-15T22:01:33  <vulture-> I doubt that
2010-09-15T22:01:33  <jmcarthur> plausible is not good enough to justify the noise, IMO
2010-09-15T22:01:36  <vulture-> I've done a lot of AI games
2010-09-15T22:01:43  <vulture-> 9:1 probably not
2010-09-15T22:01:48  <vulture-> but 4:6 maybe easily
2010-09-15T22:02:01  <amstan> jmcarthur: you're right though.. we want less noise
2010-09-15T22:02:19  <jmcarthur> if you can qualitatively prove that you aren't just talking out of your ass then you might stand a chance of convincing me that it's worth it. got any real-life numbers?
2010-09-15T22:02:29  <jmcarthur> even 4:6 is not good for us
2010-09-15T22:02:30  <Cyndre> but then its a depth search problem, not an ai problem
2010-09-15T22:03:05  <amstan> jmcarthur: you know how a unbalanced map system could work?
2010-09-15T22:03:09  <rogue780> well, let's see how my latest bot version does
2010-09-15T22:03:25  <amstan> jmcarthur: have an unbalanced factor associated with each map, then multiply the score of the winner/looser by that
2010-09-15T22:03:32  <vulture-> I fail to see how you've disproved anything here
2010-09-15T22:03:46  <jmcarthur> vulture-: i haven't attempted to
2010-09-15T22:03:46  <vulture-> more input posibilities = more reflections of how your AI performs
2010-09-15T22:03:52  <vulture-> maybe we should use only one map with 4 planets
2010-09-15T22:03:58  <amstan> jmcarthur: a bot that won from a really sucky position will get more points than winning from a good position
2010-09-15T22:03:58  <vulture-> it'd be the same right
2010-09-15T22:04:19  <jmcarthur> vulture-: but i think i've shown fairly well that asymmetrical maps would increase noise. the burden is on you to show that the noise is worth it for any statistical benefits it might have due to wonky AIs
2010-09-15T22:04:31  <vulture-> how does the noise increase exactly
2010-09-15T22:04:33  <jmcarthur> amstan: how would we come up with some a factor?
2010-09-15T22:04:36  <jmcarthur> *such a factor
2010-09-15T22:04:40  <amstan> jmcarthur: previous games
2010-09-15T22:04:52  <amstan> jmcarthur: win/looses directly
2010-09-15T22:04:53  <vulture-> if asymmetry doesnt make any difference, you end up with 1:1
2010-09-15T22:05:08  <vulture-> if it does, then it means one AI is better than another at dealing with advantage/disadvantage, and you dont end up with 1:1
2010-09-15T22:05:21  <jmcarthur> vulture-: i've been explaining it already. if we increase the odds that two closely ranked bots end up with the same score overall then we have failed to distinguish them
2010-09-15T22:05:41  <vulture-> and having asymmetric maps would attempt to distinguish them more :P
2010-09-15T22:05:52  <jmcarthur> it's not about extra bias introduced by the asymmetry. it's about smearing the results around
2010-09-15T22:05:59  <jmcarthur> vulture-: burden of proof
2010-09-15T22:06:05  <vulture-> no, it's about [20.59.21] <vulture-> if it does, then it means one AI is better than another at dealing with advantage/disadvantage
2010-09-15T22:06:13  <amstan> vulture-: we still need to play double games then
2010-09-15T22:06:17  <vulture-> yes you do
2010-09-15T22:06:19  <jmcarthur> vulture-: any numbers for that?
2010-09-15T22:06:19  <amstan> vulture-: which is not an option at this point
2010-09-15T22:06:22  <vulture-> it still has to be fair/even
2010-09-15T22:06:26  <vulture-> oh, no?
2010-09-15T22:06:34  <jmcarthur> even double games won't get rid of all the additional noise
2010-09-15T22:06:35  <amstan> vulture-: our servers are dying as is
2010-09-15T22:06:38  <vulture-> what noise
2010-09-15T22:06:41  <vulture-> haha
2010-09-15T22:06:51  <ShadeS> your servers are dying?
2010-09-15T22:06:55  <vulture-> just needs a little caressing optimization
2010-09-15T22:06:56  <ShadeS> what di dyou think you were getting indto?
2010-09-15T22:07:16  <amstan> vulture-: optimizations won't help get more games, it'll only help stability and http response times
2010-09-15T22:07:18  <ShadeS> plug in a little home server into the wall and think that'll do it? ;)
2010-09-15T22:07:30  <amstan> ShadeS: for that we need to get distribution
2010-09-15T22:07:30  <Caffeinated> You attach the 'google' name to it and wonder why people take notice?
2010-09-15T22:07:34  <vulture-> oh, cpu time isnt your bottleneck?
2010-09-15T22:07:44  <jmcarthur> vulture-: just take your "more realistic" bias from an asymmetrical map of 4:6. already we are saying that rather than a 25% chance of (1,1) being the result, that's actually a 36% chance
2010-09-15T22:07:46  <amstan> vulture-: it is..
2010-09-15T22:07:56  <vulture-> then how doesnt optimization help
2010-09-15T22:07:57  <jmcarthur> we're losing information if the result is indeed (1,1)
2010-09-15T22:08:00  <amstan> jmcarthur: again... unfairness coefficients
2010-09-15T22:08:27  <jmcarthur> amstan: i'm with you there, but we'd need to have a large sample on any given map before applying it to anybody's scores in the first place
2010-09-15T22:08:43  <jmcarthur> we would still just end up burdening the servers with games that don't even count, if we did it fairly
2010-09-15T22:09:03  <amstan> jmcarthur: yeah.. the coefficient involves writing more code
2010-09-15T22:09:09  <amstan> way more
2010-09-15T22:09:32  <jmcarthur> and running the map through a ton of bots without counting it, unless we are willing to introduce *tons* of unfairness initially
2010-09-15T22:09:56  <vulture-> [21.02.10] <jmcarthur> we're losing information if the result is indeed (1,1) <-- you dont necessarily lose information if you're using absolutes... you just dont gain any information.. or maybe you can throw out tie games, then you never lose information, but only gain information if the result is (0,2) or (2,0)
2010-09-15T22:10:00  <jmcarthur> even then, as bots improve we would have to *again* recalculate that factor
2010-09-15T22:10:16  <amstan> jmcarthur: it could be on the fly
2010-09-15T22:10:26  <jmcarthur> vulture-: not gaining information from a couple games is losing the potential information from those game in normal play
2010-09-15T22:10:29  <ShadeS> so...
2010-09-15T22:10:29  <amstan> vulture-: we just do not have enough cpu time to do more matches
2010-09-15T22:10:38  <vulture-> optimize!
2010-09-15T22:10:39  <ShadeS> from what I just read I'm pretty convinced the only winner is skynet
2010-09-15T22:10:42  <jmcarthur> amstan: with what initial value?
2010-09-15T22:10:48  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: but the information gained from a 2,0 win is worth more then a asymetrical win
2010-09-15T22:10:54  <rogue780> hey, my new bot actually won a match
2010-09-15T22:10:57  <vulture-> I just assumed google had infinite cpu time =/
2010-09-15T22:10:59  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: yeah, and the odds of that happening are vastly decreased
2010-09-15T22:11:03  <amstan> vulture-: you can't optimize! you cannot touch ppl's code

2010-09-15T22:11:35  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i agree that if we could take this to a fixpoint, we'd have about the same amount of working information, but we can't do that
2010-09-15T22:11:50  <jmcarthur> we have a limited sample size
2010-09-15T22:11:53  <amstan> jmcarthur: could be 50% for initial
2010-09-15T22:11:55  <jmcarthur> and we have to make it work
2010-09-15T22:12:06  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: nah, just give them a proportianate ranking boost to the odds of it happening and they will skip up the ranks faster eliminating games

2010-09-15T22:13:04  <jmcarthur> amstan: *ignoring* the noise
2010-09-15T22:13:07  <Caffeinated> How bout instead of just adding win/lose, adding the number of turns it takes to make a decision?
2010-09-15T22:13:12  <vulture-> I doubt it's a 1% difference
2010-09-15T22:13:31  <amstan> anyway..  this is not the point
2010-09-15T22:13:36  <Caffeinated> even with a 90% advantage, if bot A wins in 100 turns and bot B takes 300, A is clearly better
2010-09-15T22:13:41  <amstan> the point is that we can't implement either method
2010-09-15T22:13:48  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: no, what vulture said - throw out tied match's and give elo gain elogain * elogain if 2,0
2010-09-15T22:13:49  <jmcarthur> Caffeinated: that would require changing the entire ranking system. what we have right now is pretty dang good

2010-09-15T22:14:01  <amstan> running double games requires more cpu power, having coeff requires more coding
2010-09-15T22:14:10  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: but you get the general idea?
2010-09-15T22:14:35  <jmcarthur> look, i see everybody's points, i'm just saying we can't play enough games to justify the extra noise in the samples
2010-09-15T22:14:48  <jmcarthur> *over a large number of games* this might be better
2010-09-15T22:15:12  <vulture-> well I originally joined this channel thinking asymmetric games could be unfair, but as someone pointed out, you could just run it twice swapping positions, so I thought, hey that'd be fair after all... but if CPU power is limited, seems like thats more of a concern right now :P
2010-09-15T22:15:15  <jmcarthur> and i think it would have to be more than double the games

2010-09-15T22:15:58  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: or are you proposing that we count each game pair as a single game?
2010-09-15T22:15:58  <amstan> vulture-: go checkout the repo, then follow the link from the topic for decentralization, you could help with that by coding
2010-09-15T22:16:02  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: yes
2010-09-15T22:16:05  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: which would mean we have to run twice the games
2010-09-15T22:16:08  <vulture-> but the problem statement right now was ambiguous about whether maps were all symmetric or not

2010-09-15T22:16:45  <jmcarthur> a little strangeness in the results?
2010-09-15T22:17:04  <amstan> guys.. let's stop the argument, this obviously requires more study/experimentation
2010-09-15T22:17:07  <jmcarthur> does it really mean that a bot is "better" just because it handles itself better in certain situations than others?
2010-09-15T22:17:15  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: what would be easier to write a bot for - symetrical maps or asymetrical maps?
2010-09-15T22:17:17  <vulture-> I'm pretty backed up with coding and journal papers as is =/
2010-09-15T22:17:26  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: i don't see your point in asking that question
2010-09-15T22:17:40  <vulture-> jmcarthur: thats exactly what it means!
2010-09-15T22:17:43  <Caffeinated> jmcarthur: Different scenarios than mirrored games. Ability to adapt even with a completely unknown map, rather than knowing that you and the opponent have the same layout
2010-09-15T22:17:47  <jmcarthur> vulture-: then i just disagree
2010-09-15T22:17:54  <vulture-> look at the board game of Go
2010-09-15T22:17:58  <jmcarthur> vulture-: it's a different contest if that's the goal
2010-09-15T22:18:10  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: is it ai contest or depth search contest?
2010-09-15T22:18:11  <vulture-> you give a handicap of different quantity to one player
2010-09-15T22:18:25  <vulture-> and the relative difference of that handicap is pretty significant in determining how much better your AI is
2010-09-15T22:18:39  <jmcarthur> vulture-: the goal as i understand it right now is "make my bot better than yours in a 1-on-1 match. the goal that would be necessary for me to solve under your proposal would be "make my bot better than your bot under all sort of biased circumstances"
2010-09-15T22:18:53  <jmcarthur> i lost a " there
2010-09-15T22:19:00  <amstan> vulture-: in go the number of pieces put on a board by the end is very close to 50%, in our situation, no

2010-09-15T22:19:08  <Cyndre> but its not un biased - your both given the exact same maps
2010-09-15T22:19:10  <vulture-> right which is why my original original first question was if there would ever be biased circumstances
2010-09-15T22:19:26  <vulture-> thats not really an accurate analogy
2010-09-15T22:19:29  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: you dont see the point but your saying it changes the entire dynamics to unimaginable poportions
2010-09-15T22:19:36  <jmcarthur> it does
2010-09-15T22:19:49  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: if it changes it that much then there is definatly a point to it
2010-09-15T22:19:53  <vulture-> even the starting player in Go can decide the game
2010-09-15T22:19:58  <jmcarthur> it means that if you haven't been coding for that goal you need to rewind and rethink
2010-09-15T22:19:59  <vulture-> much less adding a one piece handicap
2010-09-15T22:20:14  <jmcarthur> vulture-: sure, then what's wrong with just starting fairly?
2010-09-15T22:20:15  <vulture-> yeah I was hoping to have that goal in mind before I started
2010-09-15T22:20:30  <vulture-> whether it was fair or biased would ever occur
2010-09-15T22:20:52  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: what were you coding for?  (and no Im not trolling, I am trying to understand - symetrical maps or asymetrical would not force me to do anything)
2010-09-15T22:20:53  <vulture-> fair would be simpler; biased could be more interesting
2010-09-15T22:20:57  <jmcarthur> bias happens naturally in a game. i say it's better if that bias is deserved in the first place than if it's artifically introduced
2010-09-15T22:21:08  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: neither in particular, at the moment
2010-09-15T22:21:23  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: but there are tons of strategies for which that would be a major factor
2010-09-15T22:21:36  <vulture-> I think there's a lot more significant amount of work involved in writing an AI to handle biased situation
2010-09-15T22:21:42  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: for example, if your bot has any concept of early game, mid game, late game, you're automatically screwed in a biased situation
2010-09-15T22:21:49  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: unless it can also detect that
2010-09-15T22:21:50  <vulture-> so in fact fair would be easier/simpler/less time spent for me
2010-09-15T22:21:57  <vulture-> but I still think biased would be more interesting
2010-09-15T22:22:05  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: but wouldnt the point in the game be based on the state of the game not the layout of the board?
2010-09-15T22:22:13  <jmcarthur> vulture-: perhaps, but "more fair" is another story
2010-09-15T22:22:40  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: if you know that the board always starts in a biased state then you can code for early game differently than for late game
2010-09-15T22:22:52  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: to get early advantages, for example
2010-09-15T22:23:03  <Cyndre> jmcarthur: the starting planets are matched so you both have same growth
2010-09-15T22:23:03  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: which, i should add, is a *major* win in this particular game
2010-09-15T22:23:08  <vulture-> what I wouldnt want to ever happen in an AI challenge is where you let the die roll decide which AI is better (e.g., playing biased games, and giving 1 AI more advantage-biased games than another)
2010-09-15T22:23:21  <jmcarthur> vulture-: yeah that would suck the worst
2010-09-15T22:23:38  <vulture-> I'm all for either fair or biased though, just wanna know which
2010-09-15T22:23:43  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: starting planets aren't the only thing we care about
2010-09-15T22:23:44  <vulture-> since the rules didnt seem to state it
2010-09-15T22:23:54  <jmcarthur> vulture-: i'm pretty sure we are going to go with unbiased
2010-09-15T22:24:00  <vulture-> k
2010-09-15T22:24:12  <vulture-> yeah thats like 10 times less coding
2010-09-15T22:24:21  <jmcarthur> Cyndre: what vulture- said
2010-09-15T22:25:10  <vulture-> since I have virtually no time due to papers/coding that works best for me :D
2010-09-15T22:25:18  <jmcarthur> heh
2010-09-15T22:25:32  <jmcarthur> well that was fun. we should argue more later :)

2010-09-15T22:44:07  <Cyndre> even if its only for the python starter bot

2010-09-15T22:56:57  <Cyndre> oh, just expanding on it
2010-09-15T22:57:02  <Cyndre> fleshing it out :)
2010-09-15T22:57:11  <amstan> yeah.. i undersatnd it, it has lots of potential
2010-09-15T22:57:33  <Cyndre> would it be hard server side to edit the bot file?
2010-09-15T22:57:51  <amstan> Cyndre: you can just automate a submission on every save
2010-09-15T22:58:04  <Cyndre> very cool

2010-09-15T22:58:36  <amstan> you'll have to wait till it compiles/plays a game
2010-09-15T22:58:46  <Cyndre> amstan: even if we only do it for python bot?
2010-09-15T22:58:58  <amstan> still have to be in the compile queue

2010-09-15T22:59:32  <amstan> sandboxing..
2010-09-15T22:59:39  <amstan> you can't just run it
2010-09-15T22:59:50  <amstan> and to be sandboxed it should be compiled
2010-09-15T22:59:57  <amstan> you can't just skip the compiling step
2010-09-15T23:00:02  <amstan> it'll just make things complicated
2010-09-15T23:00:11  <Cyndre> hmm, I wonder if there is a script for validating python code
2010-09-15T23:00:18  <amstan> ...
2010-09-15T23:00:22  <Cyndre> and maybe just validate it for errors on save
