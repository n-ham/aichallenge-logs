2012-02-18T08:37:40  <octi> hi there
2012-02-18T08:37:47  <octi> can anyone help me with smth?
2012-02-18T08:38:13  <UncleVasya> Maybe
2012-02-18T08:38:23  <UncleVasya> But we need to know the problem :)
2012-02-18T08:38:28  <octi> i have downloaded starter package in c++
2012-02-18T08:38:35  <octi> and created ./tutorial.sh
2012-02-18T08:38:51  <octi> but don't know how to write the code to execute the c++ bot
2012-02-18T08:39:08  <octi> python playgame.py "./abot/MyBot" "python sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py"
2012-02-18T08:39:42  <octi> how to run my c++ but from starter package from tutoria.sh
2012-02-18T08:40:49  <UncleVasya> I can show my test.cmd (I use Windows). Maybe it will help you.
2012-02-18T08:41:05  <UncleVasya> wait a sec, I'll paste it somewhere.
2012-02-18T08:41:15  <octi> alright, pastebin.com would be fine
2012-02-18T08:42:32  <UncleVasya> You know that contest is over and you'll write bot only for youself, right?
2012-02-18T08:43:16  <octi> we have a project for university
2012-02-18T08:43:19  <octi> :) homework
2012-02-18T08:43:33  <UncleVasya> good luck :)
2012-02-18T08:43:42  <UncleVasya> http://pastebin.com/7rDVahcT
2012-02-18T08:43:43  <octi> thanks :)
2012-02-18T08:44:20  <UncleVasya> It is so big because I wrote a gui for this contest and file was built automatically.
2012-02-18T08:44:43  <octi> i see
2012-02-18T08:44:47  <octi> so you practically
2012-02-18T08:44:58  <octi> give the exe file as argument
2012-02-18T08:45:33  <UncleVasya> Program is for windows-but if you are interested I can make some changes to make it run well under wine.
2012-02-18T08:46:18  <octi> got it :D
2012-02-18T08:46:24  <UncleVasya> I can show you a screenshot, just give me a good place to upload a picture.
2012-02-18T08:46:28  <octi> i created the executable
2012-02-18T08:46:43  <octi> and upload it to the same directory as tutorial.sh is
2012-02-18T08:46:47  <octi> it works :D
2012-02-18T08:46:56  <octi> ython playgame.py "./MyBot" "python sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py"
2012-02-18T08:47:04  <octi> thanks man :)
2012-02-18T08:47:17  <UncleVasya> your welcome
2012-02-18T08:47:19  <octi> your example helped me
2012-02-18T08:47:24  <octi> thanks, see ya

2012-02-18T08:47:55  <UncleVasya> ok, bye
2012-02-18T08:59:17  <mcstar> why does so many folder names start with an underscore?

2012-02-18T09:01:13  <antimatroid> is his uni assignment self selected or are uni's handing out the ai thing as an assignment?
2012-02-18T09:02:40  <UncleVasya> self-selected I think.
2012-02-18T09:02:51  <mcstar> assigned by teacher i think.
2012-02-18T09:03:57  <antimatroid> fat lot of help you two are :P
2012-02-18T09:05:08  <UncleVasya> antimatroid: are you still interesting in making maps for aichallenge or is already a passed stage for you?
2012-02-18T09:05:17  <UncleVasya> *interested
2012-02-18T09:05:23  <antimatroidl> for which game?
2012-02-18T09:05:27  <mcstar> haha
2012-02-18T09:05:30  <mcstar> ants
2012-02-18T09:05:36  <antimatroidl> not really, why?
2012-02-18T09:06:15  <mcstar> is there a pythong expert here?
2012-02-18T09:06:22  <UncleVasya> nothing special, just to support a conversation.

2012-02-18T09:09:34  <antimatroidl> or a tron revival
2012-02-18T09:09:39  <antimatroidl> i'm still inkling for a tron revival
2012-02-18T09:14:16  <mcstar> you'd need to twist it somehow to make it interesting
2012-02-18T09:14:34  <mcstar> like, combine monoply with tron
2012-02-18T09:14:39  <mcstar> o
2012-02-18T09:15:23  <mcstar> why doesnt anyone want to help me with python?
2012-02-18T09:17:28  <mcstar> this is weird
2012-02-18T09:17:37  <mcstar> i cant reason about python code
2012-02-18T09:19:36  <mcstar> probably the interactive matplotlib engine is to blame

2012-02-18T10:29:02  <amstan> it had to be portable for windows, so, i didn't want to install yet another windows package

2012-02-18T10:58:06  <mcstar> amstan: are good with python?
2012-02-18T10:58:12  <mcstar> maybe you can help me nevertheless
2012-02-18T10:58:14  <amstan> on most things, yeah
2012-02-18T10:58:50  <mcstar> so in this plotting thing, you can change plots, and call a draw() routine, and the plot updates
2012-02-18T10:59:05  <mcstar> or, just by calling some methods on an object
2012-02-18T10:59:13  <mcstar> like matlab
2012-02-18T10:59:19  <mcstar> maybe you are familiar with that
2012-02-18T10:59:39  <amstan> nope
2012-02-18T10:59:50  <mcstar> so the problem is, that this works line-by-line
2012-02-18T11:00:01  <mcstar> but not, when i have compound expressions
2012-02-18T11:00:30  <mcstar> so, a simple example:
2012-02-18T11:00:43  <mcstar> imshow(matrix1)
2012-02-18T11:00:45  <mcstar> imshow(matrix2)
2012-02-18T11:01:05  <mcstar> this draws 1 image, and then, updates the same plot, to another one
2012-02-18T11:01:18  <mcstar> but when i say somethign like this:
2012-02-18T11:01:29  <mcstar> (imshow(matrix1), imshow(matrix2))
2012-02-18T11:01:38  <mcstar> it doesnt work, i only see the second one
2012-02-18T11:01:53  <mcstar> well, imagine, ther are some sleep calls
2012-02-18T11:02:05  <mcstar> so to actually leave some time for the plotting
2012-02-18T11:02:33  <mcstar> import time
2012-02-18T11:02:35  <mcstar> import pylab as p
2012-02-18T11:02:37  <mcstar> import numpy as n
2012-02-18T11:02:39  <mcstar> while True:
2012-02-18T11:02:41  <mcstar>     p.imshow(n.random.rand(100,100))
2012-02-18T11:02:43  <mcstar>     time.sleep(1)

2012-02-18T11:02:45  <mcstar> ot this
2012-02-18T11:02:52  <mcstar> the plot only updates after the loop is over
2012-02-18T11:02:58  <mcstar> (here, by killing it)
2012-02-18T11:03:17  <amstan> the plot updating might only update after the python stuff is done
2012-02-18T11:03:29  <amstan> it might be in the same thread
2012-02-18T11:03:39  <amstan> see if there's another function that you can do to refresh the plot
2012-02-18T11:03:50  <mcstar> ive gone through the manual
2012-02-18T11:03:58  <mcstar> no luck

2012-02-18T11:05:26  <mcstar> ive taken a look at the thread and multiprocessing modules
2012-02-18T11:05:31  <amstan> you can... but that's a lot of fun in python
2012-02-18T11:05:34  <amstan> i advise against it
2012-02-18T11:05:53  <mcstar> im not sure exactly how to do it
2012-02-18T11:05:58  <mcstar> i tried, but stuck
2012-02-18T11:06:02  <mcstar> cause i dont understand the model
2012-02-18T11:06:36  <amstan> yeah, in that regard python sucks
2012-02-18T11:06:43  <amstan> but idk if you have to do that
2012-02-18T11:06:51  <amstan> i would keep bugging #matplotlib about it
2012-02-18T11:07:17  <mcstar> amstan: what really bothers me, is that the task is soo simple, and cames up trivially when you want to plot something
2012-02-18T11:07:38  <amstan> mcstar: try another library
2012-02-18T11:07:42  <amstan> you might have better luck
