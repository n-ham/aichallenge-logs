2011-04-15T00:00:30  <antimatroid> sometimes i think it's nice to have like reset() and reset(value)
2011-04-15T00:00:49  <jmcarthur> i don't miss things like that
2011-04-15T00:00:59  <antimatroid> it's a bother to remember lots of function names to do almost the same thing
2011-04-15T00:01:04  <jmcarthur> nah
2011-04-15T00:01:36  <jmcarthur> in haskell, functions are small anyway. the very idea of reset() is that it's probably just reset(value) with a default value
2011-04-15T00:01:59  <jmcarthur> so instead of having multiple versions of reset, you could generalize over values that have default values
2011-04-15T00:02:05  <jmcarthur> *types that have default values
2011-04-15T00:02:28  <jmcarthur> and then have a very generic reset function
2011-04-15T00:02:47  <jmcarthur> i made some assumptions about the intent there, i guess
2011-04-15T00:03:21  <antimatroid> yeah okay
2011-04-15T00:04:52  <jmcarthur> i guess the point i'm trying to make is that in haskell your goal is to write small, composable functions. functions that are nothing more than other functions with default arguments might be a warning sign a lot of the time
2011-04-15T00:06:14  <jmcarthur> a warning that its interface is too complicated and that some of the arguments could be inferred by type, perhaps

2011-04-15T02:56:03  *** lotus is now known as dr-
2011-04-15T02:56:25  <jaycobcoleman> good, that would be quite a pain. Much more strategy involved this way
2011-04-15T02:56:40  <antimatroid> yep, the rule has been chosen to be interesting strategy wise
2011-04-15T02:56:58  <antimatroid> the power method was perhaps more interesting imo, but people didn't understand it easily enough, so this was a great compromise
2011-04-15T02:57:16  <jaycobcoleman> I was rooting for either this or power. Really anything but itterative.
2011-04-15T02:57:23  <jaycobcoleman> I really liked power
2011-04-15T02:57:24  <antimatroid> yep :P
2011-04-15T02:57:39  <antimatroid> power was my favourite, up until damage i was fighting fiercely for power
2011-04-15T02:57:48  <antimatroid> i also fought fiercely to get row,col indexing
2011-04-15T02:58:00  <antimatroid> i simply can't understand why anyone would do x,y indexing, it's inferior
2011-04-15T02:58:28  <jaycobcoleman> why so inferior?
2011-04-15T02:58:47  <antimatroid> because if you read a char map from file, or output it, you need to transpose the map
2011-04-15T02:58:54  <antimatroid> with row,col indexing it's always the same
2011-04-15T02:59:06  <znutar_> not if you turn the monitor sideways
2011-04-15T02:59:12  <antimatroid> :P
2011-04-15T02:59:15  <jaycobcoleman> haha good point
2011-04-15T02:59:17  <antimatroid> it makes life more confusing imo
2011-04-15T02:59:54  <jaycobcoleman> You make a compelling argument
2011-04-15T03:00:19  <antimatroid> that's one of my more solid arguments over something pedantic :P
2011-04-15T03:00:57  <jaycobcoleman> You can be as pedantic as you'd like as long as you can back it up
2011-04-15T03:01:30  <antimatroid> i'm often clutching at straws i think :P
2011-04-15T03:02:42  <jaycobcoleman> I think it's a tendency of sciency people to become overly-opinionated on every issue

2011-04-15T03:06:00  <antimatroid> i wrote the c++ starter
2011-04-15T03:06:07  <antimatroid> i also did the random walk symmetric maps
2011-04-15T03:06:12  <antimatroid> and helped work out a lot of the rules
2011-04-15T03:06:33  <jaycobcoleman> There we go, I've looked through the C++ starter quite thouroughly
2011-04-15T03:06:43  <antimatroid> anything you hate?
2011-04-15T03:06:50  <antimatroid> i use the communist approach to programming

2011-04-15T03:08:20  <antimatroid> depending on what one considers as experienced, i wouldn't consider myself experienced anyway
2011-04-15T03:08:51  <jaycobcoleman> I find my efforts to learn programming constantly being thwarted by school
2011-04-15T03:09:08  <jaycobcoleman> and sleeping
2011-04-15T03:11:07  <antimatroid> i've learnt c++ mostly from these contests and writing my own game theory library
2011-04-15T03:11:34  <antimatroid> i don't know anything else well, i can hack stuff together in python now
2011-04-15T03:11:46  <antimatroid> (very) slowly trying to grasp haskell
2011-04-15T03:12:51  <jaycobcoleman> yeah my knowledge base is mostly split between c++ and python
2011-04-15T03:13:00  <jaycobcoleman> and bash
2011-04-15T03:15:43  <jaycobcoleman> you're still allowed to compete, right?
2011-04-15T03:17:47  <antimatroid> yep
2011-04-15T03:17:56  <antimatroid> anyone that doesn't have access to the severs can compete
2011-04-15T03:18:05  <antimatroid> it was pretty much allow that or have no one to work on the game
2011-04-15T03:18:27  <antimatroid> everything we know/can access is public information/open source
2011-04-15T03:19:21  <jaycobcoleman> I would imagine writing a game theory library would be pretty useful experience. Have you done much work on your own bot?

2011-04-15T03:27:25  <antimatroid> high school is years 7-10 where i live :P
2011-04-15T03:27:27  <jaycobcoleman> 4th and final
2011-04-15T03:27:45  <antimatroid> then college is year 11 and 12 (not uni), then uni
2011-04-15T03:28:14  <jaycobcoleman> hmm. We've got middle school for 7 and 8, the 9-12 is high school
2011-04-15T03:29:27  <antimatroid> we have elementary  = {kinder, prep, 1, 2}, primary = elementary or {3,...,6}, high = {7,..,10} and college = {11,12}

2011-04-15T03:41:19  <antimatroid1> an extensive form game is a tree representation of a game
2011-04-15T03:41:58  <antimatroid1> then nash equilibria are strategies where no player can alter their strategy to increase their payoff, given what the other players are doing
2011-04-15T03:42:03  <antimatroid1> do maths at uni :P
2011-04-15T03:42:07  <antimatroid1> maths is awesome
2011-04-15T03:43:07  <jaycobcoleman> agreed. I'm in my second year of calculus at the moment
2011-04-15T03:43:32  <antimatroid1> it gets a lot more fun once you get to algebra and analysis ;)
2011-04-15T03:44:17  <antimatroid1> although don't do just maths, do maths and (engineering/cs/physics/something)
2011-04-15T03:45:35  <jaycobcoleman> I'm starting to put some heavy consideration on math + cs
2011-04-15T03:46:02  <antimatroid1> it's a strong combination
2011-04-15T03:46:19  <antimatroid1> i'm  heavily biased though :P
2011-04-15T03:46:54  <sigh> yup, cs in particular is a strong combination with anything, because now everything involves a lot of computation
2011-04-15T03:47:32  <jaycobcoleman> Not sure wether I want to go micro or macro when it comes to computers and programming though
2011-04-15T03:47:46  <antimatroid1> what do you mean?

2011-04-15T04:15:49  <sigh> there is nothing impossible about being able to solve the halting problem for Turing machines, it is impossible to solve the halting problem for turing machines *on a turing machine itself*
2011-04-15T04:16:27  <Stocha> does it exists a machine that a machine turing can not emulate ?
2011-04-15T04:16:55  <Stocha> Or any solver of halting system that a machine turing can not emulate.
2011-04-15T04:16:57  <sigh> mathematically, of course... you can define such a machine into existance
2011-04-15T04:17:11  <sigh> physically, dunno... maybe, maybe not
2011-04-15T04:17:11  <Stocha> turing machin is pretty strong stuff already. With unlimited time and space.
2011-04-15T04:17:23  <Stocha> how do you define it mathematically ?
2011-04-15T04:18:41  <sigh> I define a an oracle X which takes as an input a turing machine program, and outputs 1 if it halts, and 0 if it doesn't
2011-04-15T04:19:20  <Stocha> so X is function
2011-04-15T04:19:27  <sigh> then if I combine that with a normal turing machine, I have a machine that is more powerful than a turing machine
2011-04-15T04:19:47  <sigh> sure, only catch is that X cannot be computed on a turing machine
2011-04-15T04:20:08  <sigh> but there's nothing stopping me from assuming one exists
2011-04-15T04:20:15  <Stocha> is there not ?
2011-04-15T04:20:34  <Stocha> there is nothing for stopping me assuming a set of all ordinal number exists.
2011-04-15T04:20:45  <Stocha> except mathematicians i suppose :p
2011-04-15T04:21:44  <sigh> I am not familiar with that, but as long as it is not logically inconsistent, then fine
2011-04-15T04:22:00  <Stocha> it is said to be logically inconsistent :p
2011-04-15T04:22:09  <sigh> ok, in which case then you can't
2011-04-15T04:22:20  <Stocha> So the question is, how do we now that supposing X exists is not logically inconsistent
2011-04-15T04:22:34  <sigh> there is nothing inconsistent about my oracle X, although the halting problem proves that it can't be implemented on a turing machine
2011-04-15T04:22:53  <sigh> nothing inconsistent, it has a well-defined input and output
2011-04-15T04:23:09  <Stocha> yeah so does the X function on a turing machine
2011-04-15T04:23:19  <Stocha> yet mathematicians say it is inconsistent there
2011-04-15T04:23:36  <Stocha> so having input and output is not enough to make it true.
2011-04-15T04:23:53  <sigh> but I am not saying that X has to run on a turing machine
2011-04-15T04:24:06  <Stocha> yeah
2011-04-15T04:24:16  <sigh> I am saying that it exists, that's all... if I assume that it exists than I have created a more powerful machine
2011-04-15T04:24:20  <delt0r_> Stocha: its a well known fact that oracles are not subject to turing machine limitations
2011-04-15T04:24:22  <Stocha> but when you add that, you do not have immediatly the fact it is not possible
2011-04-15T04:24:44  <sigh> which has it's own halting problem, but it's powerful enough to solve the problem for turing machines
2011-04-15T04:25:11  <Stocha> what does halting problem mean with an oracle ?
2011-04-15T04:25:20  <Stocha> it means it won't output anything ?
2011-04-15T04:25:28  <Stocha> but you said it will output either 1 or 0
2011-04-15T04:26:18  <Stocha> delt0r_: oracle are not well known to me yet.
2011-04-15T04:26:53  <sigh> yes it will output 1 or 0 because it is a more powerful machine than a Turing machine
2011-04-15T04:29:06  <sigh> the catch is that you can't feed oracle X a program which uses the oracle X as part of its program
2011-04-15T04:29:47  <sigh> which is why the normal proof of the halting problem doesn't work for oracle X
2011-04-15T04:31:11  *** Naktibalda <Naktibalda!~chatzilla@host-81-20-37-12.eckoh.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-04-15T04:33:43  <Stocha> is the oracle a turing machine ? :p
2011-04-15T04:33:49  <Stocha> i didn't get that part in wikipedia
2011-04-15T04:34:16  <Stocha> what does "finitely many" means ?
2011-04-15T04:34:19  <sigh> Stocha: it cannot be implemented on a turing machine, the halting problem is proof of that
2011-04-15T04:34:24  <Stocha> is that finite or infinite ?
2011-04-15T04:35:01  <Stocha> Yeah, but i suddenly wonder about a turing machine using another one as an oracle.
2011-04-15T04:35:07  <sigh> what context is "finitely many" is used in?
2011-04-15T04:35:36  <sigh> if you combine a turing machine with such an oracle then you create a more powerful machine
2011-04-15T04:35:50  <Stocha> e oracle machine is initialized with the work tape containing some input with finitely many 1's and the rest of the tape blank,
2011-04-15T04:36:23  <sigh> yeah, the tape has a finite number of 1s
2011-04-15T04:37:05  <Stocha> but they can be anywhere ?
2011-04-15T04:37:16  <Stocha> i mean there is no bound to how deep they can be ?
2011-04-15T04:37:36  <Stocha> so you can search forever the tape, and have no guartees that you found all ?
2011-04-15T04:37:52  <Stocha> wich means you can't count them
2011-04-15T04:38:22  <sigh> I'm not sure of the significance of that statement, so I can't really answer you
2011-04-15T04:38:32  <Stocha> okay fair enough :)
2011-04-15T04:38:47  <Stocha> the subject is time consuming though. and not very promising i suppose.
2011-04-15T04:39:24  <Stocha> I was wondering about what a tape with a finite number of 1 looked like.
2011-04-15T04:39:29  <antimatroid1> what's an oracle?
2011-04-15T04:39:32  <Stocha> infinite tape.
2011-04-15T04:40:11  <Stocha> then because i now there exists N that bound the number of 1 on the infinite tape, i wanted to find N.
2011-04-15T04:40:25  <Stocha> so i went like : let's run along the tape and find what N is.
2011-04-15T04:40:28  <Stocha> but i never found it :p
2011-04-15T04:41:01  <antimatroid1> i did :p
2011-04-15T04:41:20  <Stocha> how did you ?
2011-04-15T04:41:25  <sigh> antimatroid1: an oracle is a black-box which computes a well-defined function
2011-04-15T04:41:35  <antimatroid1> so it's a function?
2011-04-15T04:42:00  <antimatroid1> oracle:dataSet->answerSet?
2011-04-15T04:42:05  <antimatroid1> bloody smileys
2011-04-15T04:42:19  <sigh> in some contexts it is the function, in other contexts it is a turing machine combined with the function

2011-04-15T04:44:16  <sigh> Stocha: don't read so much into it... all it is saying that the the initial state can't have an infinite number of 1s

2011-04-15T04:45:36  <Stocha> what's the difference between a tape than can have an infinite number of one, and one that can't have but still can have some 1
2011-04-15T04:46:04  <Stocha> well i guess it is, if you run indefinetly you'll always find some 0 in a finite number of step
2011-04-15T04:46:38  <sigh> if the tape is initialised with a finite number of 1s, then you can define it in a finite amount of space, for example
2011-04-15T04:46:54  <sigh> the program obviously knows how many 1s there are
2011-04-15T04:46:56  <Stocha> why ?
2011-04-15T04:47:02  <Stocha> ah
2011-04-15T04:47:04  <sigh> why what?
2011-04-15T04:47:17  <Stocha> nothing :p
2011-04-15T04:47:48  <Stocha> hum something puzle me there.
2011-04-15T04:47:52  <sigh> hmm... actually
2011-04-15T04:48:08  <sigh> Stocha: I was wrong
2011-04-15T04:48:34  <Stocha> how do you proove yourself wrong on this one ?
2011-04-15T04:48:38  <sigh> the program doesn't know... the finite number of 1s just guarantees that the thing halts :P
2011-04-15T04:48:57  <sigh> I think... hmmm
2011-04-15T04:49:19  <sigh> let me look at it more
2011-04-15T04:50:08  <Stocha> That all tapes with a finite number of 1 can be defined in a finite amount of space.
2011-04-15T04:50:17  <Stocha> that's the question right ?
2011-04-15T04:50:19  <sigh> oh, that is true
2011-04-15T04:50:54  <sigh> I'm just trying about what the program knows about the initial state... and what it does
2011-04-15T04:50:57  <Stocha> Are those tapes even countables ?
2011-04-15T04:51:38  <sigh> what tapes?
2011-04-15T04:51:50  <Stocha> infinite tapes with finetly mana 1
2011-04-15T04:53:39  <sigh> well, if you don't know how many 1s there are beforehand you can't count them... but I don't see why that is a problem
2011-04-15T04:54:51  <Stocha> if there the set of infinite tapes with finetely many 1 as a cardinality > N, i doubt you will be able to show each tape can be defined in a finite amount of space :p

2011-04-15T04:55:19  <Stocha> > card (Set of all integer)
2011-04-15T04:56:25  <Stocha> i think there exists a bijection between the set of "infinite tapes with finetly many 1" and R the set of all real number.
2011-04-15T04:56:54  <Stocha> in wich case i don't think you'll be able to define each tape in a finite amount of information.
2011-04-15T04:56:58  <sigh> no, the bijection exists between them and the integerss
2011-04-15T04:57:10  <Stocha>  ?
2011-04-15T04:57:25  <Stocha> why isn't it obvious to me then :'(
2011-04-15T04:58:09  <sigh> every tape with a finite number of ones encodes an integer (in binary), and an integer can be encoded on a tape with a finite number of ones.
2011-04-15T04:58:54  <Stocha> yeah but i'm not sure i encodes an integer :p
2011-04-15T04:58:58  <Stocha> it
2011-04-15T04:59:23  <sigh> why aren't you sure?
2011-04-15T04:59:25  <Stocha> the set of all binary integer.
2011-04-15T04:59:40  <Stocha> well because. well.
2011-04-15T04:59:45  <Stocha> mm gnn
2011-04-15T05:00:09  <Stocha> each tape has P (the number of 1) as characteristic
2011-04-15T05:00:25  <sigh> ok...
2011-04-15T05:01:07  <Stocha> but the tape is infinite
2011-04-15T05:01:23  <sigh> ok...
2011-04-15T05:01:27  <Stocha> you have no garantee to go from first 1 to second one in a finite number of step do you ?
2011-04-15T05:01:40  <Stocha> never was that stated at least.
2011-04-15T05:01:56  <Stocha> that's why you can't count the number of 1.
2011-04-15T05:02:04  <Stocha> i think.
2011-04-15T05:02:16  <sigh> if the is a second 1, then you will reach it in a finite number of steps
2011-04-15T05:02:46  <sigh> *if there is a second 1
2011-04-15T05:02:48  <Stocha> but you can't decide if there is in a finite number of steps
2011-04-15T05:03:04  <sigh> if you don't know the number of 1s beforehand, sure
2011-04-15T05:03:32  <sigh> but you have the same problem with integers... if you encode an integer on a tape, you never know if it is finished
2011-04-15T05:03:37  <Stocha> it's like let's say it's an integer (binary) with only 0 or 1 One

2011-04-15T05:04:03  <Stocha> that's something else.
2011-04-15T05:04:39  <sigh> why isn't it an integer?
2011-04-15T05:05:03  <Stocha> let's say an integer is 1 or 0 for a finite number of step.
2011-04-15T05:05:21  <Stocha> then tapes with 1 or 0 in every step do not define integers.

2011-04-15T05:06:23  <Stocha> i don't see why there can't be an infinite number of 0 then.

2011-04-15T05:07:07  <Stocha> yeah.

2011-04-15T05:07:23  <Stocha> for low meaning to high meaning yes.
2011-04-15T05:07:27  <Stocha> from
2011-04-15T05:08:19  <sigh> having 0s (even an infinite number of 0s) in front of an integer does not change the value :P
2011-04-15T05:08:20  <Stocha> integer have a finite number of characters to write them
2011-04-15T05:08:40  <sigh> depends on your representation
2011-04-15T05:09:00  <sigh> you can't represent integers in a finite number of characters in base pi, for example :P
2011-04-15T05:09:23  <Stocha> integer are such that after a finite number of step, it is always the same caracter :p
2011-04-15T05:09:46  <Stocha> ah you can't do that ?
2011-04-15T05:09:54  <sigh> can't do what?
2011-04-15T05:10:33  <Stocha> integer in base pi are not integers :p
2011-04-15T05:10:41  <sigh> why not?
2011-04-15T05:10:42  <Stocha> they are reals numbers :p
2011-04-15T05:11:10  <Stocha> because they have infinite numbers of characters without them being all 1 or 0 after a finite number of step.
2011-04-15T05:11:22  <sigh> you are confusing the objects with the representation
2011-04-15T05:11:31  <Stocha> am i.
2011-04-15T05:11:45  <sigh> yes
2011-04-15T05:11:51  <Stocha> i have always used this system :p
2011-04-15T05:12:06  <Stocha> How do you write 2 in base pi ?
2011-04-15T05:12:37  <Stocha> i'm not familiar with those bases.
2011-04-15T05:12:46  <Stocha> never encountered them yet.
2011-04-15T05:12:52  <sigh> ok, 2 in base pi is just 2...
2011-04-15T05:13:09  <Stocha> ?
2011-04-15T05:13:14  <sigh> this is my favorite irrational base: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base
2011-04-15T05:13:27  <sigh> but integers have finite representation there :)
2011-04-15T05:15:16  <Stocha> all non-negative integers have a unique representation as a terminating (finite) base-φ expansion
2011-04-15T05:15:27  <Stocha> what does that phrase means ?
2011-04-15T05:15:58  <sigh> what part don't you understand?
2011-04-15T05:16:08  <Stocha> what's finite in there ?
2011-04-15T05:16:23  <sigh> the length of the sting representing the number
2011-04-15T05:16:27  <Stocha> what's a base phi expansion ?
2011-04-15T05:16:41  <Stocha> so you are saying there a finite number of characters for representing integers ?
2011-04-15T05:17:15  <Stocha> so my system hold to that base :p
2011-04-15T05:17:16  <sigh> 9 in base phi is "10010.0101" which is 10 characters long which is finite
2011-04-15T05:17:22  <sigh> sure
2011-04-15T05:17:45  <sigh> but that's just a nice property of base phi
2011-04-15T05:17:57  <Stocha> you wanted to show me there exists bases where integers cannot be represented with finite amount fo characters
2011-04-15T05:18:57  <sigh> base pi is an example if your numbers are greater than 3
2011-04-15T05:19:13  <Stocha> ah okay 2 was special case then :p
2011-04-15T05:22:04  <sigh> 4 in base pi is approximately 10.2201...

2011-04-15T05:22:22  <Stocha> i don't really get what irrationnal bases are yet :p
2011-04-15T05:23:21  <sigh> 4 = 1*pi + 0*pi^0 + 2*pi^-1 + 2*pi^-2 + 0*pi^-3 + 1*pi^-4 + ....
2011-04-15T05:23:57  <Stocha> what about 3 then ?
2011-04-15T05:24:36  <antimatroid1> i saw a compelling argument the other day for defining tau  = 2pi
2011-04-15T05:25:16  <sigh> Stocha: I am implicitly saying that the symbols we are using are 0,1,2,3 so 3 just equals 3 :)
2011-04-15T05:25:26  <sigh> antimatroid1: sure let's re-write all the textbooks :P
2011-04-15T05:25:36  <antimatroid1> sigh: don't need to
2011-04-15T05:25:43  <antimatroid1> just start writing new ones using tau
2011-04-15T05:26:38  <sigh> physicist wont be happy, they already use tau for a bunch of other stuff :P
2011-04-15T05:27:06  <antimatroid1> i don't care for physicists :P
2011-04-15T05:27:21  <Stocha> how many symbols are we using sigh ?
2011-04-15T05:27:29  <antimatroid1> what i find annoying is some game theory texts using Sigma for the set of mixed strategies
2011-04-15T05:27:56  <antimatroid1> imo Sigma should be reserved for summations
2011-04-15T05:28:17  <sigh> for base pi? just 0,1,2,3 and the decimal point, so 5 I suppose
2011-04-15T05:28:42  <sigh> antimatroid1: oh, you aren't going to like the definition of turing machines then :P
2011-04-15T05:29:26  <antimatroid1> those muggles
2011-04-15T05:29:45  <sigh> Sigma is used for the input alphabet of the tape
2011-04-15T05:30:08  <antimatroid1> yeah i just checked the wiki page
2011-04-15T05:30:14  <sigh> well, in theory of computation in general
2011-04-15T05:30:30  <sigh> not just turing machines
2011-04-15T05:30:44  <antimatroid1> yeah, i can live with it, but i wouldn't have personally made that choice
2011-04-15T05:30:55  <sigh> :P
2011-04-15T05:31:16  <antimatroid1> i would go so far as to say i would slap the person who did if given the change :P
2011-04-15T05:31:23  <antimatroid1> chance**
2011-04-15T05:31:30  <Stocha> in base Pi you should have Pi symbols don't you ?
2011-04-15T05:31:49  <Stocha> or we go for two symbols.
2011-04-15T05:31:51  <Stocha> why 5 ?
2011-04-15T05:32:31  <sigh> well, 4 really... 5th was just decimal point for completeness :P
2011-04-15T05:33:37  <sigh> Stocha: just by convention, we extend the concept of a positional number system by changing the base, but keeping the symbols as integers
2011-04-15T05:34:10  <sigh> *non-negative integers
2011-04-15T05:34:32  <sigh> of course, you can relax that constraint such as in systems like balanced ternary: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary
2011-04-15T05:35:56  <sigh> if you like, I can specify that I was talking about base pi, using the digits {0,1,2,3}
2011-04-15T05:39:50  <Stocha> okay
2011-04-15T05:40:04  <sigh> in general, a positional number system has a set of digits S and a base B, any a number is represented as a string with a finite number of digits before the decimal point and a possibly infinite number after: eg "abc.def..." is equal to a*B^2+b*B^1+C*B^0+D*B^-1+E*B^-2+F*B^-3 ...
2011-04-15T05:40:49  <sigh> in standard number systems, B is an integers and S is the set of non-negative integers less than B
2011-04-15T05:41:05  <sigh> but there is nothing wrong with making either of those anything we like :)
2011-04-15T05:41:46  <Stocha> So you take the set of real number in pi base, and a subset of them is in bijection with n. And the element of this subset have finite string writing in that base.
2011-04-15T05:42:29  <sigh> yes
2011-04-15T05:42:55  <sigh> if I understand you correctly
2011-04-15T05:42:58  <Stocha> okay i think it's enough for today :)
2011-04-15T05:43:05  <sigh> hehe :)
2011-04-15T05:43:17  <Stocha> i'll ponder on it in the upcoming 10 years, and i ask you some more questions then.
2011-04-15T05:43:22  <sigh> :P
2011-04-15T05:43:32  <Stocha> hopefully you'll still be on the channel.
2011-04-15T05:43:36  <sigh> at that point I'll hit you with 2-adic integers
2011-04-15T05:43:42  <sigh> they are cool
2011-04-15T05:43:55  <Stocha> at that point you'll have the field medal i hope :p
2011-04-15T05:44:33  <sigh> haha

2011-04-15T09:28:53  <jaycobcoleman> *to be
2011-04-15T09:29:25  <janzert> no, you can see https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ant-bot-input-output for information on what is given to the bot
2011-04-15T09:32:28  <jaycobcoleman> It shows "Players 2" being output, so assume this is being output only to the contestant then?
2011-04-15T09:33:00  <jaycobcoleman> yes, got it
2011-04-15T09:33:44  <janzert> just so it's clear, the player number is given after the game has ended
2011-04-15T09:33:52  <janzert> along with the scores
2011-04-15T09:38:16  <antimatroid> i requested the number of players at the end so my life was simpler :)
2011-04-15T09:39:39  <jaycobcoleman> I think I'd like to add a function to some of the starter packs to determine the least number of players possible based on the different ant owners the bot has encountered. It's always going to be a power of two, correct?
2011-04-15T09:40:18  * janzert still thinks it is misleading and basically useless to give that final state to the last bot but... *shrug*
2011-04-15T09:41:22  <janzert> most likely number of players won't be limited to power of 2
2011-04-15T09:41:28  <antimatroid> janzert: it's there for people to test with, you at least want the scores
2011-04-15T09:41:44  <janzert> but only the last bot living even gets it
2011-04-15T09:41:54  <janzert> you really should be handling it outside of the bot
2011-04-15T09:42:05  <antimatroid> the number of players can be anything and still get symmetry
2011-04-15T09:42:21  <antimatroid> it's very neat how well symmetry works on the torus
2011-04-15T09:42:57  <jaycobcoleman> This is quite neat. I still haven't taken a good look at the map generator.
2011-04-15T09:43:06  <jaycobcoleman> I thought it was simpler than that
2011-04-15T09:43:21  <antimatroid> do you know what gcd and lcm are?
2011-04-15T09:43:29  <jaycobcoleman> yes
2011-04-15T09:44:23  <antimatroid> the idea of the symmetric maps is to pick noPlayers, rows, cols, row_translate, col_translate so that if you take a location, say (0,0) and translate it noPlayers times, you end up back on the same square (0,0)
2011-04-15T09:44:58  <antimatroid> so then when you create a map, you just pick out a square that hasn't been filled yet, then tile the information noPlayer times
2011-04-15T09:45:58  <jaycobcoleman> did you create the symmetric and the asymmetric?
2011-04-15T09:46:04  <antimatroid> yes
2011-04-15T09:46:19  <antimatroid> the asymmetric was fairly trivial compared to the symmetric, i just built it afterwards

2011-04-15T09:47:49  <jaycobcoleman> yes I though I heard him say something about that a couple days ago
2011-04-15T09:50:07  <antimatroid> i tried making some with perlin noise but never had much success
2011-04-15T09:50:11  <antimatroid> and pure random sucked
2011-04-15T09:50:30  <jaycobcoleman> I should think so
2011-04-15T09:50:55  <jaycobcoleman> I'll certainly gather some of my own ideas together and see if I can get something functional
2011-04-15T09:51:44  <antimatroid> making maps is often one of the funnest and most overlooked problems imo
2011-04-15T09:52:14  <jaycobcoleman> You have a lot of experience outside this competition?
2011-04-15T09:52:27  <antimatroid> nope, had my first go at making maps for planet wars
2011-04-15T09:53:03  <jaycobcoleman> Wish I could've done that one
2011-04-15T09:53:14  <jaycobcoleman> But honestly I had no idea this existed then
2011-04-15T09:53:21  <antimatroid> planet wars was annoyingly complicated
2011-04-15T09:53:28  <antimatroid> i expect this to be simpler for people
2011-04-15T09:53:33  <Naktibalda> oh really?
2011-04-15T09:53:45  <Naktibalda> IMHO it's in opposite
2011-04-15T09:53:51  <antimatroid> not necessarily to win, but do make a lot of noticable improvements
2011-04-15T09:53:59  <Naktibalda> unless you are talking about TOP 10
2011-04-15T09:54:00  <antimatroid> i think it will be easier with that respect

2011-04-15T09:54:54  <antimatroid> my tron bot actually taught me a thing or two about perfect play
2011-04-15T09:54:58  <antimatroid> i don't think my pw bot ever did that
2011-04-15T09:55:12  <antimatroid> particularly with (I think) the keyhole map

2011-04-15T10:00:54  <Stocha> Yeah i have a proposition for some maps. i call them the buble maps. I didn't try them yet. i guess i should. So many things i "should" do :p

2011-04-15T10:01:09  <Stocha> So (for assymetrical) the idea is : choose some points
2011-04-15T10:01:31  <Stocha> grow a buble arround that point (can be any shape but let's say it's round)
2011-04-15T10:01:43  <Stocha> Then you connect thoses bubles with corridors.
2011-04-15T10:02:17  <Naktibalda> it could be like planet wars :)
2011-04-15T10:02:25  <Stocha> yeah.
2011-04-15T10:02:37  <Stocha> let's call that a planetwar with tunnels
2011-04-15T10:03:14  <Stocha> it think it would be pretty different from most maps we have yet. but i don't know if i'd like to see them too often :p
2011-04-15T10:03:45  <Stocha> The you could go for some kind of tree bubles also
2011-04-15T10:04:19  <Stocha> rather than being conected randomly, the main buble forms a grid let's say. And then from there goes a node of bubles
2011-04-15T10:04:43  <Stocha> You could try to use some factals also. Fractal buble maps.
2011-04-15T10:04:53  <Stocha> Speaking of fractals.
2011-04-15T10:05:58  <Stocha> Or maybe you just put the bubles, and grow them randomly until they touch oneanother.
2011-04-15T10:06:12  <jaycobcoleman> do the corridors connect on the edges so it can wrap?
2011-04-15T10:06:16  <Stocha> then you would have the reverse buble system. (water bubles)
2011-04-15T10:06:27  <Stocha> jaycobcoleman: you have to
2011-04-15T10:06:40  <Stocha> maps are supposed to wrap
2011-04-15T10:06:46  <Stocha> you can't simple build a central stuff.
2011-04-15T10:06:51  <Stocha> although maybe that is possible
2011-04-15T10:07:00  <Stocha> like you do a single buble in the middle
2011-04-15T10:07:43  <Stocha> Or a fractal tree that gros out
2011-04-15T10:07:55  <Stocha> or spiral galactic shape
2011-04-15T10:08:28  <Stocha> What about regular polygons in the middle. That is symetric. even if it doesn't wrap.

2011-04-15T16:05:35  <antimatroid> bhasker: run one of the play_one_game scripts
2011-04-15T16:05:45  <antimatroid> grab the output from the replay file in viewer
2011-04-15T16:05:56  <antimatroid> then open copy_pate.html in visualiser and paste it in there
2011-04-15T16:06:02  <antimatroid> we haven't simplified it yet sorry :P
2011-04-15T16:06:04  <bhasker> ah k
2011-04-15T16:06:44  <antimatroid> i use the following script
2011-04-15T16:06:45  <antimatroid> #!/usr/bin/env sh

2011-04-15T16:06:52  <bhasker> cool thanks
2011-04-15T16:07:40  <antimatroid> those are actually c++ bots, i was lazy and just chucked them in that folder

2011-04-15T16:16:37  <bhasker> thanks
2011-04-15T16:16:40  <bhasker> vmware
2011-04-15T16:16:42  <bhasker> image
2011-04-15T16:16:48  <skynetz> yes
2011-04-15T16:16:57  <bhasker> basically something that you could download and run in vmplayer
2011-04-15T16:16:58  <skynetz> not vmware specifically
2011-04-15T16:17:01  <antimatroid> i have no idea what that is, i'm sure some people would like it
2011-04-15T16:17:04  <bhasker> well yea can be xen or w/e
2011-04-15T16:17:13  <bhasker> its basically a virtual machine
2011-04-15T16:17:21  <bhasker> that comes with everything you need to run the code
2011-04-15T16:17:27  <bhasker> and you just download and boot it up
2011-04-15T16:17:34  <antimatroid> oh that might be cool
2011-04-15T16:17:41  <antimatroid> McLeopold: ^^?
2011-04-15T16:18:06  <antimatroid> although would it work on any os?
2011-04-15T16:18:11  <skynetz> and because from the little i've seen it messes with various parts of configurations
2011-04-15T16:18:20  <skynetz> yes
2011-04-15T16:18:25  <antimatroid> :)
2011-04-15T16:18:44  <bhasker> though vm's are notoriously slow
2011-04-15T16:18:53  <bhasker> so..
2011-04-15T16:18:58  <bhasker> not sure how useful it will be
2011-04-15T16:19:05  <skynetz> hmm indeed
2011-04-15T16:19:22  <bhasker> running vmware on my macbook makes me wanna pull my hair out

2011-04-15T16:20:54  <antimatroid> i wouldn't run it, but it might be useful for people who don't have the tools and would struggle installing them all
2011-04-15T16:21:03  <antimatroid> ie. beginners
2011-04-15T16:24:42  <bhasker> probably
2011-04-15T16:28:28  <bhasker> antimatroid the script you gave me
2011-04-15T16:28:36  <bhasker> i modified it to run ants.py
2011-04-15T16:28:43  <bhasker> instead of antbot as there is no such file in that directory
2011-04-15T16:28:45  <antimatroid> i'm on ubuntu
2011-04-15T16:28:52  <antimatroid> yeah, i told you that's what i use
2011-04-15T16:29:00  <antimatroid> use the play_one_game scripts :P
2011-04-15T16:29:03  <bhasker> hmm
2011-04-15T16:29:11  <antimatroid> i was more pointing out how you can turn symmetric food spawning on
2011-04-15T16:29:30  <bhasker> oh
2011-04-15T16:29:34  <antimatroid> you should be able to run the play_one_game things from the command line
2011-04-15T16:29:51  <antimatroid> cmd for windows, sh for linux/mac
2011-04-15T16:30:11  <bhasker> ah i think i know what mistake i made
2011-04-15T16:34:47  <skynetz> food/maps are going to be symmetric?
2011-04-15T16:36:42  <bhasker> so how does this visualizer work i started up the httpserver
2011-04-15T16:36:52  <bhasker> but the start/stop link just keeps blinking

2011-04-15T16:50:20  <antimatroid> i expect asymmetric maps to be too unfair though

2011-04-15T16:51:36  <antimatroid> frontier made it
2011-04-15T16:51:47  <skynetz> Probably, so may I assume that it hasn't been finalised if it's going to be asymmetric and/or symmetric maps?
2011-04-15T16:52:00  <antimatroid> yes, nothing has been finalised about maps
2011-04-15T16:52:25  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-04-15T16:52:28  <antimatroid> there's the specs page
2011-04-15T16:52:43  <bhasker> its sweet, shows fog of war too
2011-04-15T16:52:44  <bhasker> awesome
2011-04-15T16:53:09  <bhasker> so will 4 be the max players per game?>
2011-04-15T16:53:16  <bhasker> or can there be any number of players?
2011-04-15T16:53:18  <bhasker> from 2-4?
2011-04-15T16:53:36  <skynetz> I think i found a map where there can be 10
2011-04-15T16:54:21  <bhasker> i wonder if it would be interesting to have a single player mode with a greedy bot, the bot to eat all food in the shorteest time wins
2011-04-15T16:54:31  <antimatroid> atm 26 is the hard maximum
2011-04-15T16:54:38  <antimatroid> but i expect it to be in the 4-6 range
2011-04-15T16:55:16  <antimatroid> although i think the only thing left restricting it to 26 players is the map format
2011-04-15T16:55:26  <antimatroid> for map files that is

2011-04-15T17:06:08  <antimatroid> like if i just click, edit page, then preview, the formatting just committed suicide or something :\
2011-04-15T17:06:42  <amstan> did you change the markup type by mistake?
2011-04-15T17:06:46  <amstan> make sure it's markdown
2011-04-15T17:07:44  <antimatroid> it's on markdown

2011-04-15T17:13:21  <antimatroid> amstan: i have a feeling they changed the formatting for github wikis
2011-04-15T17:13:29  <amstan> antimatroid: maybe
2011-04-15T17:13:31  <antimatroid> i might have to suck it up and fix it up again
2011-04-15T17:13:43  <antimatroid> if i add an empty line before it, it fixes itself
2011-04-15T17:14:21  <antimatroid> so it wont be too hard to fix either
2011-04-15T17:14:56  <antimatroid> hmmm or would that be a bug on their part?
2011-04-15T17:15:09  <amstan> i think that's how it's supposed to be
2011-04-15T17:15:27  <antimatroid> you used to be able to add two empty spaces to the end of a line as like a newline character
2011-04-15T17:15:42  <antimatroid> well, clearly it worked before :P

2011-04-15T17:31:22  <antimatroid> the attack radius is sqrt(6)
2011-04-15T17:31:34  <antimatroid> so any enemy ants within that radius get an equal share of the damage
2011-04-15T17:31:53  <antimatroid> then any ants that sustain at least 1 damage on that turn (damage doesn't carry across turns) dies
2011-04-15T17:32:34  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I'm thinking we should bring it down to sqrt(4)

2011-04-15T17:36:22  <bhasker> so anytime ants come within sqrt(6) distance they will each do 1 point damage totally to all neighbouring ants?

2011-04-15T17:38:20  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I would like spawn radius to be 1
2011-04-15T17:39:15  <bhasker> and no diagonal movement is allowed right?
2011-04-15T17:39:22  <antimatroid> no diagonal movement
2011-04-15T17:39:32  <bhasker> k  i guess that makes pathfinding rather simple
2011-04-15T17:39:34  <antimatroid> i don't like people being able to spawn ants across water, which is still possible with diagonal
2011-04-15T17:39:46  <antimatroid> i would prefer people have to actually go around the water to the food
2011-04-15T17:39:51  <bhasker> and i was reading the twiki, can ants/water spawn on water?
2011-04-15T17:39:58  <antimatroid> no they can't

2011-04-15T19:15:48  <bhasker> question
2011-04-15T19:15:55  <bhasker> does the engine does drop a bot if it makes an invalid move
2011-04-15T19:15:56  <antimatroid> answer
2011-04-15T19:16:07  <bhasker> i am seeing my bot play till turn 20 and stops doing anything after that
2011-04-15T19:16:11  <antimatroid> no, it ignores invalid movses
2011-04-15T19:16:14  <bhasker> hmm weird
2011-04-15T19:16:21  <bhasker> my bot just stops at a certain point
2011-04-15T19:16:25  <bhasker> i don't see it doing anything
2011-04-15T19:16:29  <antimatroid> it if crashes or times out it will stop participating
2011-04-15T19:16:32  <antimatroid> and the ants will stop moving
2011-04-15T19:16:59  <antimatroid> the ants are removed from the game so neighbouring enemies at least have to kill off what you had
2011-04-15T19:17:09  <antimatroid> in an attempt and not unbalancing the game too much
2011-04-15T19:17:12  <bhasker> ah but the engine doesn't seem to output anything:-\
2011-04-15T19:17:15  <janzert> s/are/are not
2011-04-15T19:17:20  <bhasker> telling me that i am being dropped
2011-04-15T19:17:23  <bhasker> etc
2011-04-15T19:17:35  <antimatroid> hmm, yeah that should really be done
2011-04-15T19:17:35  <bhasker> and how much time does one have per turn?
2011-04-15T19:17:47  <antimatroid> atm 1000 milliseconds
2011-04-15T19:17:50  <antimatroid> but hopefully longer than hat
2011-04-15T19:17:59  <bhasker> hmm maybe running 5 bots is probably killing that
2011-04-15T19:17:59  <antimatroid> otherwise people wont be able to do anything cool
2011-04-15T19:18:21  <bhasker> i really wonder with 5-6 bots playing
2011-04-15T19:18:30  <bhasker> how will we insulate one bot from other bots aggresiveness
2011-04-15T19:18:41  <bhasker> like if a couple of bots hog the cpu
2011-04-15T19:18:42  <antimatroid> sigwait or whatever
2011-04-15T19:18:45  <bhasker> and the other guy timesout
2011-04-15T19:18:53  <janzert> sigstop
2011-04-15T19:18:55  <antimatroid> not sure how we're going to ensure people get enough memory though
2011-04-15T19:18:58  <bhasker> hmm
2011-04-15T19:18:58  <bhasker> k
2011-04-15T19:19:08  <bhasker> so you stop the bot let the other ones run
2011-04-15T19:19:11  <bhasker> and do it in round robin?
2011-04-15T19:19:18  <bhasker> giving each one a certain amount of time?
2011-04-15T19:19:21  <janzert> pretty much
2011-04-15T19:19:33  <bhasker> so games would last 6times longer if there are 6 bots?
2011-04-15T19:19:56  <bhasker> oops i mean for each bot the turn time will go up by 1 seocnd?
2011-04-15T19:20:22  <antimatroid> yep

2011-04-15T19:47:39  <janzert> main thing I guess is battle resolution is officially the damage optioin
2011-04-15T20:05:04  <bhasker> another thing why does a map not accept less than max players?
2011-04-15T20:07:30  <janzert> because it's not max players, it's number of players for the map ;)
2011-04-15T20:07:50  <janzert> the engine just doesn't have any provision for not filling in every player spot
2011-04-15T20:08:34  <bhasker> hmm
2011-04-15T20:08:39  <bhasker> should be trivial change right?
2011-04-15T20:08:46  <bhasker> to ignore certain start spots?
2011-04-15T20:09:14  <bhasker> would make testing a lot easier if we could play every map with just 2 bots
2011-04-15T20:09:15  <janzert> it probably would be, but don't expect the resulting game to be anything like fair
2011-04-15T20:09:43  <janzert> just fill the slots with hunterbot :)
2011-04-15T20:09:48  <bhasker> maybe we could modify the command to allow for exact start positions to be specified
2011-04-15T20:09:50  <bhasker> for each player
2011-04-15T20:09:59  <bhasker> holdbot is probably better
2011-04-15T20:10:03  <bhasker> since it doesn't do anything
2011-04-15T20:10:10  <janzert> that works too
2011-04-15T20:10:10  <bhasker> so won't use up cpu
2011-04-15T20:26:50  <bhasker> hmm
2011-04-15T20:27:18  <bhasker> doh figured out why i was timing out
2011-04-15T20:27:24  <bhasker> the game engine is not reading the stderr of the bots
2011-04-15T20:27:28  <bhasker> so if the bot outputs any logs
2011-04-15T20:27:36  <bhasker> then the write to stderr eventually blocks
2011-04-15T20:27:39  <bhasker> and timesout the bot
