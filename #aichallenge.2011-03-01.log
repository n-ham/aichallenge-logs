2011-03-01T00:03:22  <Frontier> "constant variables" is an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymoron
2011-03-01T00:03:49  <antimatroid> i dunno
2011-03-01T00:03:56  <antimatroid> a variable can be constant
2011-03-01T00:04:03  <antimatroid> in maths as well
2011-03-01T00:04:19  <antimatroid> i see what you're trying to say, but :P
2011-03-01T00:04:28  <Frontier> you and your definitions! you made that up, didn't you?
2011-03-01T00:04:37  <amstan> antimatroid: git clone git://gist.github.com/847673.git
2011-03-01T00:04:52  <amstan> antimatroid: no need to use the web interface
2011-03-01T00:05:26  <Frontier> but it renders all file contents in a conviniently formatted web page, amstan
2011-03-01T00:05:40  <amstan> Frontier: ...to edit the files
2011-03-01T00:06:08  <Frontier> right, different story ^^
2011-03-01T00:06:22  <antimatroid> yeah meh for the moment :)
2011-03-01T00:06:34  <amstan> antimatroid: you could be using this opportunity to learn version control
2011-03-01T00:06:47  <Frontier> So I can use these files to write a D starter bot? :p
2011-03-01T00:06:54  <amstan> it's a small project, you're the only guy editing
2011-03-01T00:06:55  <antimatroid> Frontier: go for it :P
2011-03-01T00:07:24  <antimatroid> amstan: where do i learn about version control then? :P
2011-03-01T00:07:40  <antimatroid> i was going to play around with perlin noise again this afternoon
2011-03-01T00:08:04  <amstan> antimatroid: you could be using it for your starter package: git clone git://gist.github.com/847673.git
2011-03-01T00:08:23  <computerwiz_222> amstand and I collaborated on a project last year and he made it absolutely hell by forcing me to use git from command line. I look back, it was worth it
2011-03-01T00:08:33  <Frontier> By working in a software company. That works best I think. Lots of conflict merging, branching stable and testing version. All the fun you can't have when you work alone.
2011-03-01T00:08:33  <amstan> antimatroid: after you edit a file, you type git status to see what file changed, you type git add . to add everything, then git commit -m "your message" to commit
2011-03-01T00:08:47  <antimatroid> i don't have one of those key things to use git
2011-03-01T00:09:03  <amstan> antimatroid: you only need git, you already have a repo... any gist is a repo
2011-03-01T00:09:03  <antimatroid> and everything on my computer is a mess, i really need to format, the command line can't even find gcc
2011-03-01T00:09:05  <Frontier> you need linux :o
2011-03-01T00:09:10  <Frontier> use putty
2011-03-01T00:09:17  <Frontier> it can export to openssh keys
2011-03-01T00:09:38  <computerwiz_222> lol...
2011-03-01T00:10:18  <antimatroid> frontier is right, i need to jump ship from linux
2011-03-01T00:10:21  <antimatroid> from windows***
2011-03-01T00:10:39  <computerwiz_222> do it already?
2011-03-01T00:11:00  <computerwiz_222> you know.. this is how i ended up using linux fulltime...
2011-03-01T00:11:04  <computerwiz_222> ditched windows for mac
2011-03-01T00:11:13  <antimatroid> yes, i have done full switches before
2011-03-01T00:11:16  <amstan> antimatroid: suggestions: s/DEBUGGING/DEBUG
2011-03-01T00:11:25  <antimatroid> i don't even have office installed anymore, if latex is too much notepad will do
2011-03-01T00:11:30  <amstan> antimatroid: and don't use if(DEBUG), do a preprocessor if
2011-03-01T00:11:37  <amstan> that way it's not a runtime check
2011-03-01T00:11:40  <amstan> but a compile time
2011-03-01T00:12:01  <antimatroid> how do i do that? oO (I'm a terrible programmer as you know)
2011-03-01T00:12:29  <Frontier> compile with -DDEBUG :)
2011-03-01T00:12:30  <amstan> sec...
2011-03-01T00:12:34  <amstan> Frontier: no
2011-03-01T00:12:37  <amstan> Frontier: not yet...
2011-03-01T00:12:37  <Frontier> oh :/
2011-03-01T00:12:58  <amstan> antimatroid: read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor
2011-03-01T00:13:17  <amstan> antimatroid: might want to look at #define DEBUGPRINT2(...)       fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
2011-03-01T00:13:24  <Frontier> That's 19 laptop pages :O
2011-03-01T00:13:28  <amstan> antimatroid: that way you can have those statments everywhere
2011-03-01T00:13:56  <antimatroid> i don't need it anywhere else :P
2011-03-01T00:14:00  <antimatroid> this is simple :\
2011-03-01T00:14:19  <amstan> antimatroid: this is a starter pack though
2011-03-01T00:14:28  <antimatroid> the simpler the better
2011-03-01T00:14:29  <amstan> advanced users will probably use this
2011-03-01T00:14:31  <antimatroid> for a starter pack
2011-03-01T00:14:38  <amstan> it's meant for learning
2011-03-01T00:14:44  <amstan> this would qualify
2011-03-01T00:16:46  <Frontier> if (DEBUG) is really common and speeds up the executable a bit when debugging is turned off compared to a runtime if.
2011-03-01T00:19:51  <antimatroid> done
2011-03-01T00:25:05  <amstan> antimatroid: https://gist.github.com/848648
2011-03-01T00:26:39  <sigh> amstan, this is a bit better: #define debug(...) { fprintf(stderr,__VA_ARGS__); fflush(stdout); }
2011-03-01T00:26:52  <sigh> (putting multiple statements inside a block)
2011-03-01T00:26:57  <amstan> oh.. ok
2011-03-01T00:27:16  <sigh> that way "if(foo) debug();" still works :P
2011-03-01T00:27:19  <amstan> sigh: you're right, if i put it in a if
2011-03-01T00:27:20  <amstan> yeah
2011-03-01T00:27:22  <amstan> fixed
2011-03-01T00:27:54  <amstan> antimatroid: why is that awesome? because when you compile it with DEBUG=0, all debug print statments will not even get compiled in the program
2011-03-01T00:28:28  <sigh> oh lol, and you are writing to stderr then flushing stdout :D
2011-03-01T00:28:45  <amstan> sigh: yeah.. i copied this code from another project of mine..
2011-03-01T00:28:57  <amstan> fixed
2011-03-01T00:29:06  <antimatroid> i don't get why i would want to send it to stderr?
2011-03-01T00:29:11  <sigh> yeah, I know... I do that all the time too
2011-03-01T00:29:14  <amstan> antimatroid: stdout then
2011-03-01T00:29:20  <amstan> antimatroid: or a file..
2011-03-01T00:29:21  <antimatroid> that is blocked
2011-03-01T00:29:28  <antimatroid> amstan: i already have it going to a file
2011-03-01T00:29:37  <amstan> but is it compile time?
2011-03-01T00:29:44  <antimatroid> it is now
2011-03-01T00:29:50  <amstan> link?
2011-03-01T00:29:51  <antimatroid> hang on, i'll update girhub
2011-03-01T00:30:36  <antimatroid> amstan: https://gist.github.com/847673
2011-03-01T00:30:43  <antimatroid> go to the bug.h/cc files
2011-03-01T00:31:36  <amstan> antimatroid: i still don't like it though
2011-03-01T00:31:45  <antimatroid> Bug can basically be treated like a filestream, it's wonderful
2011-03-01T00:32:04  <amstan> antimatroid: right now.. if you do a for(int i=0;i<MAXINT;i++) {BUG<<i;}
2011-03-01T00:32:14  <amstan> it'll still have function calls and stuff
2011-03-01T00:32:29  <amstan> if debugging is disabled..
2011-03-01T00:32:43  <amstan> if you do it the way i had it, there's no function calls if debug is 0
2011-03-01T00:32:43  <antimatroid> wont you always?
2011-03-01T00:32:46  <amstan> no
2011-03-01T00:33:25  <amstan> if debug is 0, in my case, you get for(int i=0;i<MAXINT;i++) {debug("%d",i);}, which gets simplified to for(int i=0;i<MAXINT;i++) {(1);}, then to for(int i=0;i<MAXINT;i++);
2011-03-01T00:33:40  <antimatroid> hmm, okay, i'll change it
2011-03-01T00:33:47  <sigh> antimatroid: the preprocessor directives changes the code which gets sent to the compiler
2011-03-01T00:33:53  <amstan> antimatroid: in your case.. you actually call Bug& operator<< MAXINT times
2011-03-01T00:34:06  <amstan> antimatroid: which does nothing.. but you still call it
2011-03-01T00:34:10  <antimatroid> yeah, i know my way will call that
2011-03-01T00:34:24  <amstan> there might be a way to make it work your way..
2011-03-01T00:34:28  <amstan> but idk enough c++ for that
2011-03-01T00:34:31  <antimatroid> i don't think so
2011-03-01T00:34:35  <amstan> i'm a C kinda guy
2011-03-01T00:34:54  <amstan> thing is that debug() is not a function, it's a macro
2011-03-01T00:35:18  <amstan> maybe you could inline the Bug& operator<< call
2011-03-01T00:35:22  <amstan> idk if it'll work or not
2011-03-01T00:35:23  <sigh> in planet wars I made up something which is probably not very idomatic c++, so I could do stuff like: LOG( foo << bar << baz)
2011-03-01T00:35:36  <sigh> https://github.com/sigh/Planet-Wars/blob/master/src/Log.h
2011-03-01T00:36:34  <Frontier> In D you write 'version(debug) stderr.writeln("something happened @", __FILE__, ":", __LINE__);'
2011-03-01T00:36:35  <amstan> sigh: you didn't have a turn off debugging option, did you?
2011-03-01T00:36:48  <amstan> Frontier: in python this is even nicer
2011-03-01T00:36:56  <sigh> amstan, what do you mean?
2011-03-01T00:37:06  <sigh> debugging was off by default
2011-03-01T00:37:07  <amstan> Frontier: the __FILE__ stuff can be taken care for you automatically
2011-03-01T00:37:11  <Frontier> hehe, I think so. Python is really a nice language
2011-03-01T00:37:15  <amstan> sigh: is there a way to turn off logging?
2011-03-01T00:37:24  <amstan> sigh: while making everything faster?
2011-03-01T00:37:37  <sigh> amstan, there is no logging is DEBUG is not defined
2011-03-01T00:37:59  <amstan> sigh: won't you get a compile time error?
2011-03-01T00:38:00  <sigh> line 6 starts the #ifdef
2011-03-01T00:38:12  <amstan> sigh: since it doesn't know what the LOG macro does?
2011-03-01T00:38:30  <amstan> oh.. nvm, you have an else
2011-03-01T00:38:32  <amstan> nvm
2011-03-01T00:38:33  <amstan> it's all good
2011-03-01T00:38:36  <sigh> amstan, this was part of my pw submission, it compiled just fine
2011-03-01T00:39:11  <amstan> antimatroid: so yeah.. look at sigh's log code: https://github.com/sigh/Planet-Wars/blob/master/src/Log.h
2011-03-01T00:39:14  <sigh> it *worked*, I just doubt very much that it is idiomatic c++ or good practice in any way
2011-03-01T00:41:33  <amstan> antimatroid: make yours inline, and i think it'll have the same speed
2011-03-01T00:41:41  <antimatroid> amstan: that debug function is awful
2011-03-01T00:41:47  <amstan> antimatroid: how?
2011-03-01T00:41:54  <amstan> antimatroid: well.. yeah.. it's a c function
2011-03-01T00:41:55  <antimatroid> it can't take multiple arguments
2011-03-01T00:41:59  <amstan> yes it can
2011-03-01T00:42:06  <antimatroid> or doubles, etc.
2011-03-01T00:42:08  <sigh> that's what __VA_ARGS__ is for
2011-03-01T00:42:11  <amstan> just treat it like printf
2011-03-01T00:42:20  <sigh> it just copies the arguments you give it
2011-03-01T00:42:35  <amstan> antimatroid: though.. you will need stdio.h
2011-03-01T00:43:34  <antimatroid> it's still claiming too many arguments :\
2011-03-01T00:44:30  <antimatroid> amstan: " make yours inline, and i think it'll have the same speed" i don't get it?
2011-03-01T00:44:45  <amstan> antimatroid: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_function
2011-03-01T00:45:17  <antimatroid> ah i see
2011-03-01T00:45:56  <sigh> antimatroid: how are you calling debug that causes the too many args error?
2011-03-01T00:46:12  <antimatroid> debug("test ", "int");
2011-03-01T00:46:22  <amstan> antimatroid: no...
2011-03-01T00:46:29  <sigh> oh, you need to use it like printf
2011-03-01T00:46:35  <antimatroid> oh, rank
2011-03-01T00:46:44  <amstan> antimatroid: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf
2011-03-01T00:46:45  <antimatroid> i'm going with inline
2011-03-01T00:48:41  <antimatroid> i don't mind messy code for black boxes, but if i have to use something, i want it to look nice and be easy :)

2011-03-01T00:50:49  <amstan> with c++ you have to do: cout << n << "has" << i << "prime factors. And the colour is " << colour << "." << endl;
2011-03-01T00:51:19  <amstan> with printf("%d has %d prime factors. And the colour is %s.\n", n, i, colour);
2011-03-01T00:51:24  <sigh> and have fun if you want to do any advanced formatting on those values :P
2011-03-01T00:51:25  <amstan> which is longer?
2011-03-01T00:51:46  <amstan> sigh: you mean hex << int << n? lol
2011-03-01T00:51:50  <antimatroid> can you write a function to pass a state to printf?
2011-03-01T00:51:57  <antimatroid> i can do bug << state << endl
2011-03-01T00:51:59  <amstan> antimatroid: state? huh?
2011-03-01T00:52:11  <sigh> amstan, yup :P
2011-03-01T00:52:14  <antimatroid> and that will output the state grid to the file stream
2011-03-01T00:52:16  <amstan> antimatroid: as in an int that's 0 or 1?
2011-03-01T00:52:28  <antimatroid> it's be an mxn char map
2011-03-01T00:52:31  <amstan> antimatroid: all you need is a function that returns a string
2011-03-01T00:52:32  <antimatroid> it'll*
2011-03-01T00:52:41  <antimatroid> over m lines
2011-03-01T00:53:17  <amstan> antimatroid: so... you'll only use such a print function for debugging, since your bot doesn't output other strings like that
2011-03-01T00:53:37  <antimatroid> amstan: what if i want to output the state to file?
2011-03-01T00:53:37  <amstan> antimatroid: if you really want to make a function that returns such a state.. construct your function with debugs
2011-03-01T00:53:52  <amstan> fprintf()?
2011-03-01T00:53:54  <antimatroid> it's a c++ bot, why not use c++ syntax?
2011-03-01T00:54:02  <amstan> i agree with that.. fine
2011-03-01T00:54:08  <antimatroid> :)
2011-03-01T00:54:15  <antimatroid> i will add the inline stuff though, i agree with you on that
2011-03-01T00:54:20  <amstan> and that's why i don't like c++ though, lol
2011-03-01T00:54:27  <antimatroid> :P
2011-03-01T00:56:13  <antimatroid> i'm not sure inline functions will make this any faster
2011-03-01T00:56:38  <antimatroid> it still has to call an empty function yeah? and i still need to return a Bug reference on << to compose stuff
2011-03-01T00:56:48  <sigh> errr... inline means there is no function call
2011-03-01T00:56:49  <amstan> antimatroid: if it's inline, there's no calling taking place
2011-03-01T00:57:12  <sigh> (that is if c++ listens to you, it can ignore you and make it a function anyway)
2011-03-01T00:57:14  <amstan> antimatroid: inline means.. copy this function in every place that it's called and expand it
2011-03-01T00:57:24  <antimatroid> oh, err i am retarded :)
2011-03-01T00:57:44  <antimatroid> but will i have trouble with bug << "test" << "this";?
2011-03-01T00:57:52  <antimatroid> because wont it become << "this;
2011-03-01T00:57:53  <amstan> should work, i think

2011-03-01T01:00:31  <amstan> antimatroid: because there's a return bug
2011-03-01T01:00:31  <antimatroid> isn't that how those functions work?
2011-03-01T01:00:38  <amstan> which also gets inlined
2011-03-01T01:00:45  <antimatroid> ah, so still return the bug?
2011-03-01T01:00:48  <antimatroid> that was my issue
2011-03-01T01:00:50  <antimatroid> i'm all good now
2011-03-01T01:00:51  <sigh> (<< "this") is not valid code
2011-03-01T01:01:08  <antimatroid> sigh: that was my point, i thought it would break because i thought i was making the else function return nothing
2011-03-01T01:01:16  <amstan> sigh: it won't, because of the return
2011-03-01T01:01:19  <amstan> antimatroid: *
2011-03-01T01:01:20  <antimatroid> it's all good now
2011-03-01T01:01:27  <amstan> antimatroid: any inline functions act the same as non-inline
2011-03-01T01:01:35  <amstan> they're just faster, and take more space
2011-03-01T01:01:37  <sigh> amstan, I know, I was commenting on what antimatroid said
2011-03-01T01:01:47  <amstan> sigh: wrong person
2011-03-01T01:01:51  <antimatroid> so it would be ideal to use inline pretty much everywhere?
2011-03-01T01:01:59  <amstan> antimatroid: yes and no
2011-03-01T01:02:08  <antimatroid> yes for me, no for the server?
2011-03-01T01:02:10  <sigh> antimatroid: it makes your binary bigger if you do it everywhere
2011-03-01T01:02:15  <amstan> antimatroid: if your code is huge, the cpu has to get more stuff from the ram, you'll have a ton of cache misses
2011-03-01T01:02:21  <amstan> antimatroid: therefore it'll actually go slower
2011-03-01T01:02:25  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-03-01T01:02:41  <amstan> antimatroid: only inline if you call it in few places, but you call it a lot
2011-03-01T01:02:49  <amstan> ex: inside a huge loop
2011-03-01T01:03:19  <amstan> and if your inlined function is small of course...
2011-03-01T01:03:36  <amstan> in your case.. your inline function has just the return, if debug is off
2011-03-01T01:04:34  <amstan> Frontier & mcleopold: what's the diff between ants/viewer and ants/www?
2011-03-01T01:05:56  <Frontier> ants/viewer was McLeopold's canvas visualizer
2011-03-01T01:06:06  <antimatroid> poo, it's now not working with endl
2011-03-01T01:06:15  <amstan> Frontier: well.. which one is cooler/working?
2011-03-01T01:06:25  <antimatroid> i don't think it likes that being inline
2011-03-01T01:06:28  <amstan> Frontier: /keeping?
2011-03-01T01:06:39  <Frontier> amstan: Of course mine is cooler
2011-03-01T01:06:52  <amstan> Frontier: does it work? any point to keeping the old one?
2011-03-01T01:07:03  <Frontier> ask McLeopold if he wants to remove his from git to avoid confusion
2011-03-01T01:07:55  <amstan> contestbot: later tell mcleopold can you remove ants/viewer? i was told frontier's visualizer is cooler, and can replace yours
2011-03-01T01:07:55  <contestbot> amstan: As you wish.
2011-03-01T01:08:00  <amstan> there :)
2011-03-01T01:08:01  <Frontier> It hasn't been updated in a while I would assume and is no longer working with the newer replays, has no keyboard input etc.
2011-03-01T01:08:52  <Frontier> amstan: McLeopold and I still have to work together, so don't make me look like a douche ^^.

2011-03-01T01:09:04  <amstan> Frontier: lol
2011-03-01T01:09:37  <amstan> antimatroid: feel free to ask in #c++, i'm not exactly sure how the overloaders work

2011-03-01T01:10:21  <amstan> Frontier: about the canvas not working in ie, we can probably do excanvas
2011-03-01T01:10:26  <Frontier> There are some strict rules on inlining. The compiler must know what method get's called at runtime of course.
2011-03-01T01:10:54  <Frontier> amstan: Did you read the bug report I posted?
2011-03-01T01:10:56  <antimatroid> Frontier: i expect it's the "std::ostream& (*manipulator)(std::ostream&)" parameter
2011-03-01T01:11:05  <amstan> Frontier: yes, it's in front of me

2011-03-01T01:13:26  <amstan> Frontier: well.. if it's not 100%, it's fine.. as long as you see ants as pixels.. it's probably good
2011-03-01T01:13:52  <Frontier> amstan: I had that workin
2011-03-01T01:13:54  <amstan> we can probably include a message to get a canvas supported browser
2011-03-01T01:14:31  <sigh> what percentage of hits to the site are IE?
2011-03-01T01:14:51  <amstan> let me bring up analytics
2011-03-01T01:14:56  <Frontier> I want to popup an 'alert('Go get a standards compliant browser to view this as it is meant to be!')'

2011-03-01T01:15:06  <amstan> Frontier: yep.. lol
2011-03-01T01:15:20  <Frontier> It is in the bug report :)
2011-03-01T01:15:32  <sigh> only 5%?
2011-03-01T01:15:35  <janzert> I looked it up this morning for Mcleopold :)
2011-03-01T01:15:36  <sigh> who cares then? :P
2011-03-01T01:16:06  <amstan> they say the same for linux, so.. if they do it for us, why should we care for them? lol
2011-03-01T01:16:17  <Frontier> sigh: Sometimes I think that myself - all the trouble for 5% of users who can easily install a second browser ^^.
2011-03-01T01:16:35  <antimatroid> Frontier: i have ie6 handy :P
2011-03-01T01:16:41  <sigh> this is why I avoid web dev :P
2011-03-01T01:16:41  <amstan> 6% IE
2011-03-01T01:16:54  <antimatroid> i should start browsing the site for ie6 ehe
2011-03-01T01:16:58  <antimatroid> from*
2011-03-01T01:17:03  <amstan> 70% of IE is IE8, 12% is IE7
2011-03-01T01:17:12  <amstan> 10% is IE9
2011-03-01T01:17:17  <amstan> and 6% is IE6
2011-03-01T01:17:32  <Frontier> oh we have some 9ers already? that one has canvas support i believe
2011-03-01T01:17:53  <amstan> Frontier: right!!! and microsoft supports standards properly..
2011-03-01T01:18:10  <amstan> they never had any compatibility issues to stuff they haven't made, lol
2011-03-01T01:18:44  <amstan> Frontier: newvisits is 10% IE though
2011-03-01T01:19:01  <amstan> Frontier: so maybe we should work on that
2011-03-01T01:19:56  <Frontier> amstan: newvisits = new ip?
2011-03-01T01:20:22  <amstan> Frontier: i'm pretty sure there's some tracking cookie magick happening
2011-03-01T01:20:29  <Frontier> or just antimatroid testing all versions from ie 5 to 9?
2011-03-01T01:20:50  <amstan> antimatroid: yes, make sure our side works in ie5!
2011-03-01T01:21:51  <sigh> I'm going to start hitting the site with lynx
2011-03-01T01:21:56  <sigh> support that
2011-03-01T01:22:01  <amstan> sigh: lynx should work fine
2011-03-01T01:23:45  <amstan> woah, my wikipedia page got imporved: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AI_Challenge

2011-03-01T01:25:16  <amstan> antimatroid: and that's why i don't like c++, because of those monstrosities
2011-03-01T01:25:32  <amstan> sigh: it's pretty standards compliant, the website
2011-03-01T01:25:35  <antimatroid> amstan: but it's wonderful to use
2011-03-01T01:25:44  <amstan> antimatroid: not really

2011-03-01T01:38:22  <McLeopold> antimatroid: http://www.savagechickens.com/2009/08/something-new.html <-- a description like that
2011-03-01T01:38:39  <amstan> McLeopold: cowboys and aliens!
2011-03-01T01:38:50  <antimatroid> http://codepad.org/ZKrF837z <- maze maps
2011-03-01T01:39:13  <amstan> antimatroid: why don't we use # for walls?
2011-03-01T01:39:17  <McLeopold> wow, so much for radius
2011-03-01T01:39:18  <antimatroid> ask mcleopold
2011-03-01T01:39:27  <McLeopold> because it's for comments
2011-03-01T01:39:29  <amstan> antimatroid: and space for passable
2011-03-01T01:39:41  <McLeopold> so you can count it
2011-03-01T01:39:44  <amstan> use ; for comments
2011-03-01T01:39:51  <amstan> it's more visible
2011-03-01T01:40:02  <amstan> or //
2011-03-01T01:40:03  <McLeopold> where were you 1 month ago?
2011-03-01T01:40:06  <amstan> lol
2011-03-01T01:40:08  <amstan> fine
2011-03-01T01:40:17  <antimatroid> amstan: i fought for #, it doesn't matter though
2011-03-01T01:40:22  <McLeopold> it ain't code
2011-03-01T01:40:26  <amstan> antimatroid: # all the way!
2011-03-01T01:40:29  <antimatroid> and i don't like ' ' for land
2011-03-01T01:40:43  <antimatroid> even though bots don't ever see char maps anymore
2011-03-01T01:41:23  <amstan> McLeopold: what's https://github.com/McLeopold/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/install_server.sh?
2011-03-01T01:41:23  <McLeopold> okay, tabs for walls, spaces for land
2011-03-01T01:41:44  <amstan> McLeopold: then you get http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)
2011-03-01T01:41:45  <McLeopold> my notes, it's grown
2011-03-01T01:41:51  <antimatroid> McLeopold: i like it :P
2011-03-01T01:42:18  <amstan> McLeopold: like these? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/blob/epsilon/README.md
2011-03-01T01:44:08  <antimatroid> McLeopold: "wow, so much for radius"?
2011-03-01T01:44:14  <McLeopold> yeah, but I'm going for totally automatted
2011-03-01T01:44:27  <McLeopold> oh, with the maze maps being single file
2011-03-01T01:44:42  <amstan> McLeopold: why do you need totally automated db creation?
2011-03-01T01:44:45  <McLeopold> a different tactic may be in order
2011-03-01T01:45:13  <McLeopold> the more automated, the better
2011-03-01T01:45:27  <amstan> McLeopold: you only do this once..
2011-03-01T01:45:28  <McLeopold> so I can blow away my server and set it up again with 1 command
2011-03-01T01:45:32  <antimatroid> there is a better way to do symmetric maps, but i haven't quite worked out how to make them yet
2011-03-01T01:45:51  <amstan> antimatroid: make a map, half the height, then mirror it
2011-03-01T01:46:12  <antimatroid> the idea is to basically find rtranslate and ctranslate such that translating a position n (no players) times gets you back to the same position
2011-03-01T01:46:14  <McLeopold> amstan: also, you said that last time, for the last contest, and here we are fighting with getting servers working
2011-03-01T01:46:42  <amstan> McLeopold: ok
2011-03-01T01:47:55  <antimatroid> i think if you start with a square nxn grid with players along the diagonal you can do random transformations to get any of the possible scenarios
2011-03-01T01:48:37  <McLeopold> www -> website?  a little bikeshedding?
2011-03-01T01:49:02  <amstan> McLeopold: just to have the same name as zeta
2011-03-01T01:49:27  <amstan> epsilon now has the same folder structure as zeta
2011-03-01T01:49:34  <McLeopold> okay
2011-03-01T01:49:40  <McLeopold> I have a git question
2011-03-01T01:49:45  <amstan> fire
2011-03-01T01:49:54  <McLeopold> when I pulled, I still have a www folder, what's the git way to clean it
2011-03-01T01:50:35  <amstan> McLeopold: git clean -n .
2011-03-01T01:50:49  <amstan> McLeopold: it'll output what it will remove, then use f instead of n if you're sure
2011-03-01T01:51:12  <amstan> i usually do git add ., git reset --hard instead
2011-03-01T01:51:59  <McLeopold> what's the difference?
2011-03-01T01:52:06  <amstan> i think it's the same
2011-03-01T01:52:35  <amstan> it's just that i remember the latter easier
2011-03-01T01:53:33  <McLeopold> my trueskill dir is empty?
2011-03-01T01:53:33  <Frontier> what is coffeescript?
2011-03-01T01:53:41  <McLeopold> compiles to javascript
2011-03-01T01:53:52  <Frontier> kk
2011-03-01T01:53:55  <amstan> McLeopold: you have to init it: git submodule init; git submodule update
2011-03-01T01:53:58  <McLeopold> an attempt to improve js syntax
2011-03-01T01:54:29  <McLeopold> amstan: so then, it's not really in the repo?
2011-03-01T01:55:01  <amstan> McLeopold: nope, it's an outside repo
2011-03-01T01:55:45  <McLeopold> hmm... then in zeta, hopefully games can be submodules
2011-03-01T01:55:54  <amstan> yeah, that would be cool
2011-03-01T01:56:33  <amstan> submodules can be branches of the same repo i think
2011-03-01T01:57:29  <McLeopold> I don't get the init command, was that the full syntax?
2011-03-01T01:58:10  <McLeopold> oh, had to be at root
2011-03-01T01:58:11  <amstan> git submodule init should work
2011-03-01T02:00:40  <McLeopold> antimatroid: are you committing the map maker to git?
2011-03-01T02:00:50  <antimatroid> McLeopold: which one? :P
2011-03-01T02:00:55  <McLeopold> all of them
2011-03-01T02:01:20  <antimatroid> they're all a mess, i can give you one if you need it for testing? otherwise i don't think there's a huge rush atm
2011-03-01T02:01:52  <McLeopold> how many python files?
2011-03-01T02:02:00  <antimatroid> a single file per map gen
2011-03-01T02:02:07  <antimatroid> do you want asymmetric?
2011-03-01T02:02:48  <McLeopold> do you have git write access?
2011-03-01T02:03:04  <antimatroid> no, nor do i know how :P
2011-03-01T02:03:18  <antimatroid> actually, asymmetric is the slowest
2011-03-01T02:03:23  <McLeopold> do you want it?  do you use something else?
2011-03-01T02:03:34  <antimatroid> don't give me write access, i'd break things
2011-03-01T02:03:46  <McLeopold> ok then
2011-03-01T02:03:57  <amstan> antimatroid: too late
2011-03-01T02:03:58  <McLeopold> do you have any vcs?
2011-03-01T02:04:09  <antimatroid> i don't even know what that is :P
2011-03-01T02:04:18  <amstan> someone should teach you
2011-03-01T02:04:20  <McLeopold> scm? vcs?
2011-03-01T02:04:30  <antimatroid> nope :P
2011-03-01T02:04:32  <McLeopold> hg, git, svn, sourcesafe
2011-03-01T02:04:43  <McLeopold> haha, got you, that last one doesn't count
2011-03-01T02:05:14  <McLeopold> okay, it's time to drink the coolaid
2011-03-01T02:05:14  <amstan> McLeopold: lol
2011-03-01T02:05:39  <amstan> McLeopold: little did he know, he just used a scm: https://gist.github.com/847673
2011-03-01T02:06:37  <antimatroid> McLeopold: http://codepad.org/gqEqucp2 add that for the moment if you want
2011-03-01T02:07:27  <amstan> codepad should interface with github gists
2011-03-01T02:08:16  <McLeopold> antimatroid: I don't need your code now.  I just want to get you hooked into the system.
2011-03-01T02:08:23  <McLeopold> ready to learn git?
2011-03-01T02:08:33  <amstan> McLeopold: he's on windows
2011-03-01T02:08:36  <antimatroid> last time i tried i failed at getting one of those passkeys
2011-03-01T02:08:38  <McLeopold> so am i
2011-03-01T02:08:45  <amstan> McLeopold: perfect then,
2011-03-01T02:08:46  <antimatroid> go for it though :)
2011-03-01T02:09:26  <amstan> antimatroid: just remember one thing.. with git, you can't break it... everything that you put in it will still be there
2011-03-01T02:11:03  <McLeopold> http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
2011-03-01T02:11:11  <McLeopold> that's what I use
2011-03-01T02:11:19  <McLeopold> it's command line
2011-03-01T02:11:29  <McLeopold> I also installed the unix tools from it, which is nice
2011-03-01T02:11:45  <McLeopold> amstan: he has commit rights?
2011-03-01T02:12:01  <amstan> McLeopold: yes, you'll have to guide him through key setup though
2011-03-01T02:12:03  <McLeopold> get the top link, git-blabla-preview
2011-03-01T02:12:17  <McLeopold> amstan: we'll start with password
2011-03-01T02:12:27  <amstan> you can use just a password?
2011-03-01T02:12:30  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-01T02:12:37  <amstan> i didn't know that, :O

2011-03-01T02:13:22  <antimatroid> yeah i'm doing stuff
2011-03-01T02:14:00  <antimatroid> what's the one with the unix tools?
2011-03-01T02:14:16  <amstan> antimatroid: cygwin?
2011-03-01T02:14:19  <McLeopold> in the git-preview install, it's on one of the wizard pages
2011-03-01T02:14:25  <antimatroid> ah okay
2011-03-01T02:14:43  <antimatroid> amstan: it's installed, have never used it though
2011-03-01T02:14:43  <McLeopold> amstan: this is a little better than cygwin
2011-03-01T02:15:07  <antimatroid> i'm on a 1500k line, so it'll take a few minutes to download
2011-03-01T02:15:32  <antimatroid> it's at about 45%

2011-03-01T02:22:46  <Frontier> antimatroid: another funny line in your code: getline(is, junk);
2011-03-01T02:23:23  <antimatroid> Frontier: why is that funny?
2011-03-01T02:23:44  <McLeopold> antimatroid: win7?
2011-03-01T02:23:45  <Frontier> because getline is junk makes a sentence

2011-03-01T04:45:58  <antimatroid> i think spawn, just noticed i still have birth in my starter pack
2011-03-01T04:50:56  <aerique> antimatroid: i'd rather use CL :)  anyway, i'll checkout the repo and work on my own starter pack and if he doesn't write one i'll commit my substandard one
2011-03-01T04:52:26  <antimatroid> sounds good :)
2011-03-01T04:52:50  <antimatroid> there's a very unofficial competition for best starter pack
2011-03-01T04:53:30  <antimatroid> and i think the unofficial judge will be the relative rankings of people right at the beginning, so maybe not much room for you :P
2011-03-01T04:53:36  <antimatroid> as people don't really use lisp
2011-03-01T04:54:10  <Frontier> i don't know if i got ie working on wine and what version it is. it always throws 'Invalid parameter' errors when I enter a url and looks like ie6 although winetricks supposedly installed ie8
2011-03-01T04:54:19  <aerique> i don't mind that, as long as i can use it.  there's always been some people using the last two challenges
2011-03-01T04:54:34  <antimatroid> that wont be an issue
2011-03-01T04:54:47  <antimatroid> i'm pretty sure what's already there will be there again
2011-03-01T05:21:26  <Frontier> wine doesn't display the javascript errors in ie, but i found that I can get at the information if I override window.onerror(msg, source, line)
2011-03-01T05:24:44  <antimatroid> the world would be a lot better off without ie
2011-03-01T05:36:14  <Frontier> antimatroid: watch this in ie ^^: http://marco-leise.homedns.org/antgui/work/visualizer.php?game_id=2#visualizer

2011-03-01T05:48:23  <antimatroid> there isn't any major rush on bots
2011-03-01T05:48:52  <mega1> I should have a bit more time next month, so it's possible.
2011-03-01T05:49:03  <antimatroid> it is next month :P
2011-03-01T05:49:39  <mega1> depends on how much you lag
2011-03-01T05:49:59  <mega1> I mean April.
2011-03-01T05:50:44  <antimatroid> i think we'd be hoping to be live by then
2011-03-01T05:50:54  <antimatroid> i think aerique is happy to write one anyway
2011-03-01T05:51:03  <mega1> quite possible
2011-03-01T05:51:21  <mega1> how long will the contest itself be?
2011-03-01T05:51:31  <antimatroid> i think we might go for 2 months
2011-03-01T05:51:37  <antimatroid> via the goldy locks principle
2011-03-01T05:51:45  <antimatroid> tron was too short, pw possibly too long?
2011-03-01T05:51:54  <antimatroid> it's still undecided though
2011-03-01T05:53:02  <mega1> have the game changed during the last couple of weeks?
2011-03-01T05:53:39  <antimatroid> mega1: not a huge amount, mostly input etc., this wiki page is up to date bar viasuliser input
2011-03-01T05:53:50  <antimatroid> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-01T05:54:14  <antimatroid> Frontier: does it work in your ie? that was ie6 i tested it in (I don't bother updating it, i don't use it)
2011-03-01T05:56:07  <antimatroid> the "starter strategy" we've mostly agreed on is pretty stupid and easy to do, iterate through the ants, moving them n, e, s, or w (first one that is land) if possible, and letting them collide (with the intention of that being the first change for beginners)
2011-03-01T05:56:17  <mega1> "code that specifically implements anything related to the moves a bot would make"???
2011-03-01T05:56:30  <antimatroid> yeah, i need to phrase that better
2011-03-01T05:56:52  <antimatroid> it's basically to say it would be better if you don't share your code for your actual bot, but i don't want it to sound like people can't share tools or general strategies
2011-03-01T05:57:09  <mega1> okay
2011-03-01T05:57:15  <mega1> how about this: "will either spawn into an ant or disappear, depending on whether there is a conflict"?
2011-03-01T05:57:26  <mega1> what's a conflict in this context?
2011-03-01T05:57:39  <antimatroid> a.*.b
2011-03-01T05:57:49  <antimatroid> both are outside the battle distance, but both would spawn an ant
2011-03-01T05:57:53  <antimatroid> so the food dies
2011-03-01T05:58:06  <antimatroid> it's outlined better below, that's just a really general explanation about the game
2011-03-01T05:59:13  <antimatroid> the turn input explanation is a bit of a mess too, we only recently decided on it, but the examples should make it clear
2011-03-01T06:04:11  <Frontier> antimatroid: it loads in what i believe is ie 8.
2011-03-01T06:04:44  <Frontier> but as i am editing this page all the time you might often hit it when it has errors
2011-03-01T06:05:14  <antimatroid> it loaded in chrome for me
2011-03-01T06:05:25  <antimatroid> i don't think ie6 should be much of a priority anyway
2011-03-01T06:06:00  <antimatroid> could it be me not having something installed for java?
2011-03-01T06:06:02  <antimatroid> like with flash?

2011-03-01T06:06:17  <antimatroid> for ie**
2011-03-01T06:06:33  <mega1> what's the range for n anyway?
2011-03-01T06:06:48  <antimatroid> atm it's undecided, i've been using {4, 6, 9}
2011-03-01T06:07:04  <antimatroid> i think dmj111 has done some stuff about rankings with trueskill
2011-03-01T06:07:30  <antimatroid> i don't think anything has actually been done about adding it to the server, but it's on the list
2011-03-01T06:08:00  <antimatroid> jeff only just emailed dmj about it a few days ago after having not really thought about it for a while

2011-03-01T06:18:06  <aerique> mega1: yeah, i was wondering whether you had plans writing a starter package for this challenge, so we don't get in eachothers way
2011-03-01T06:19:25  <mega1> aerique: I don't know yet. Most likely I won't have the time to do it before the contest starts.
2011-03-01T06:20:03  <aerique> mega1: alright, i'll go make an initial package then
2011-03-01T06:20:25  <mega1> with a ProxyBot?
2011-03-01T06:21:00  <mega1> and asdf? :-)
2011-03-01T06:21:11  <aerique> mega1: sure :)
2011-03-01T06:21:19  <mega1> cool
2011-03-01T06:21:24  <aerique> mega1: you can always update it to something better
2011-03-01T06:21:42  <aerique> mega1: did you make any improvements to the proxybot last challenge?
2011-03-01T06:22:55  <mega1> I put it into its own package, added a one-shot param, ported it to allegro cl since
2011-03-01T06:23:14  <mega1> and probably a few tweaks here and there
2011-03-01T06:24:38  <aerique> mega1: okey, good to know.  i'll it out
2011-03-01T06:29:03  <aerique> am i supposed to be able to play a local game once i've checked out aichallenge from github?  (i'm running into some issues)
2011-03-01T06:36:14  <antimatroid> aerique: i'm yet to run a game with an engine locally
2011-03-01T06:36:57  <antimatroid> i just added a cpp starter bot to github, it should show up in a minute
2011-03-01T06:39:58  <aerique> antimatroid: ah alright, good to know.  so you guys are running against a server then?
2011-03-01T06:40:56  <antimatroid> i haven't run any games

2011-03-01T11:36:46  <janzert> I think amstan adapted those from my old notes
2011-03-01T11:37:21  <janzert> the ssh keys are definitely outdated and overall they seem to mix worker and main server setup
2011-03-01T11:37:47  <McLeopold> okay, still wrapping my head around how it all works.  the more cleanup the better
2011-03-01T11:39:19  <janzert> I did start working on getting a local setup so I can do it myself with the current layout and maybe give slightly better advice on the details no needed

2011-03-01T11:50:51  <janzert> McLeopold: my guess would be you have a previous submission that hasn't been compiled
2011-03-01T11:51:20  <janzert> any uncompiled submission or a submission more recent than 10 minutes in the past will trigger that
2011-03-01T11:51:43  <McLeopold> I think it's probably related to a blank database
2011-03-01T11:52:52  <janzert> hmm, possibly. the check is done in has_recent_submision in submission.php
2011-03-01T11:52:58  <jmcarthur> mega1: no, trueskill is order dependent. that's a downside
2011-03-01T11:53:26  <mega1> yeah, it tickled my memory
2011-03-01T11:53:33  <mega1> what's the upside?
2011-03-01T11:53:50  <McLeopold> dmj111 had an idea to reduce the errors
2011-03-01T11:54:18  <McLeopold> it only matters for a tie, which should be rare, and we can just put the lower ranked player first
2011-03-01T11:54:25  <jmcarthur> mega1: good matchmaking algorithm, supports >2 players, potential for not *completely* resetting score on resubmission
2011-03-01T11:54:36  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-208-118.dynamic.chello.pl> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-01T11:54:42  <janzert> not sure how a blank database would cause has_recent_submission to return true though
2011-03-01T11:54:42  <jmcarthur> mega1: and a nice climbing behavior instead of jumping around
2011-03-01T11:54:42  <McLeopold> then, if you have a series of 2 player matches ending in draws, the errors should cancel somewhat
2011-03-01T11:54:54  <jmcarthur> more intuitive in that sense
2011-03-01T11:55:11  <jmcarthur> i lot of people complain that bayeselo makes no sense if you don't know how it works
2011-03-01T11:55:12  <mega1> not completely resetting is a double edged sword
2011-03-01T11:55:17  <jmcarthur> i agree
2011-03-01T11:55:33  <jmcarthur> but at least with trueskill there is a more principled way to do it
2011-03-01T11:55:43  <McLeopold> another upside is it handles n-player with ties
2011-03-01T11:56:02  <mega1> I guess that's the main attraction.
2011-03-01T11:56:07  <McLeopold> janzert: the sql is coming back with '1'
2011-03-01T11:56:23  <jmcarthur> upon resubmit, we could set sigma (uncertainty) to a large value, which means that the bot will start playing against bots of a similar skill to before the resubmission. might lead to a faster convergence and more interesting games
2011-03-01T11:56:36  <McLeopold> janzert: ah, it is an uncompiled submission
2011-03-01T11:56:58  <jmcarthur> but since the uncertainty is high the bot can change rank much faster
2011-03-01T11:57:01  <janzert> ahh, good (in the sense that I didn't see how it could return 1 with a blank database) :)
2011-03-01T11:57:09  <jmcarthur> uncertainty shrinks for each game played
2011-03-01T11:57:27  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: trueskill is designed to add uncertainty over time (and you probably know this), so we just need to pick a nice value on resubmit
2011-03-01T11:58:03  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: well, we have to change it from the norm slightly in that we don't want to add (much?) uncertainty between games unless there is a resubmission
2011-03-01T11:58:29  <jmcarthur> and technically a resubmission can change nearly everything about the bot, so that would have to be a big change, technically
2011-03-01T11:58:57  <jmcarthur> anyway, yet another nice thing about doing it this way is that newly resubmitted bots will appear very low in the rankings and just converge more quickly, rather than appearing to not move at all
2011-03-01T11:58:58  <mega1> Time can also change things because many bots will have been resubmitted.
2011-03-01T11:59:09  <jmcarthur> mega1: ah indeed
2011-03-01T11:59:13  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: I'm thinking only add it on resubmit
2011-03-01T11:59:35  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: no i think we will need to give it a little adjustment each game, primarily due to what mega1 just said
2011-03-01T11:59:46  <jmcarthur> and then give it a much bigger adjustment on resubmission
2011-03-01T12:00:09  <McLeopold> okay, small change for everyone each interval, large change for individual on resubmit
2011-03-01T12:00:19  <jmcarthur> yeah, that's what i'm thinking
2011-03-01T12:00:27  <jmcarthur> wait, each interval?
2011-03-01T12:00:33  <jmcarthur> it's typically each game
2011-03-01T12:00:44  <McLeopold> if there are no resubmissions, then there is no need
2011-03-01T12:00:47  <jmcarthur> hmm...
2011-03-01T12:00:58  <McLeopold> the best would be to add a little for everyone on any submission
2011-03-01T12:01:00  <jmcarthur> okay, change everyone a little on each resubmission
2011-03-01T12:01:03  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-03-01T12:01:13  <jmcarthur> and the one that was resubmitted gets changed more
2011-03-01T12:01:22  <McLeopold> but, that would be lost of work, so just count the resubmissions every 10 minutes or so
2011-03-01T12:01:29  <jmcarthur> sure, that works
2011-03-01T12:01:47  <jmcarthur> so much for incremental, though
2011-03-01T12:02:06  <jmcarthur> still more incremental than bayeselo at least
2011-03-01T12:02:38  <jmcarthur> i guess 10 minutes isn't going to be a big hit to accuracy, really. okay, i'm happy with that proposal
2011-03-01T12:02:48  <amstan> McLeopold: hmm, idk
2011-03-01T12:02:49  <McLeopold> near the deadline, uncertainty will spike :)
2011-03-01T12:02:59  <amstan> McLeopold: know php?
2011-03-01T12:03:00  <McLeopold> amstan: i figured it out
2011-03-01T12:03:08  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: heh. and nobody will know where they should really be ;)
2011-03-01T12:03:10  <amstan> what was it?
2011-03-01T12:03:10  <McLeopold> unfortunatley, yes
2011-03-01T12:03:21  <McLeopold> I haven't turned on the background cron jobs yet
2011-03-01T12:03:31  <jmcarthur> they will only know with 95% certainty that they should be at least their current rank :P

2011-03-01T12:06:08  <amstan> McLeopold, antimatroid: for the people that want to make starter packages, what documentation can i give them?
2011-03-01T12:06:14  <amstan> or example bots in other languages
2011-03-01T12:09:45  <DanielVF> jmcarthur have you tested ranking bots with trueskill?
2011-03-01T12:11:12  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: it's hard to test because it's also dependent on the matching algorithm
2011-03-01T12:11:33  <DanielVF> http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=1349
2011-03-01T12:11:43  <jmcarthur> DanielVF: i've been meaning to try it though, with a decent model for bots
2011-03-01T12:12:09  <DanielVF> Yes, I agree, you have to test both the matching and the ranking together
2011-03-01T12:13:25  <jmcarthur> i was thinking of pregenerating a pool of bots with various skills and consistencies, then simulating matches with probabilistic outcomes
2011-03-01T12:13:41  <DanielVF> *nods*
2011-03-01T12:13:50  <jmcarthur> gets even tougher if you want to also test the resubmissions idea
2011-03-01T12:14:06  <jmcarthur> but i think that idea by itself wouldn't be too hard to implement
2011-03-01T12:14:30  <DanielVF> *nods*
2011-03-01T12:15:14  <DanielVF> We do need to be sure to test it before the contest on a large enough scale.
2011-03-01T12:16:20  <jmcarthur> well we aren't wanting to use this for the final tournament anyway. this is basically just to provide the benefit of getting accurate rankings more quickly during development
2011-03-01T12:17:05  * janzert thinks the same thing should be used for the final tournament as the open tournament period
2011-03-01T12:17:23  <janzert> the less changes that can be made between the two the better
2011-03-01T12:17:59  <jmcarthur> well then we definitely can't use trueskill
2011-03-01T12:18:19  <janzert> although I do see the draw of using a direct elimination tournament for the finals
2011-03-01T12:18:22  <jmcarthur> it doesn't work well without the matching algorithm
2011-03-01T12:18:33  <jmcarthur> so we can't do anything like a bracket
2011-03-01T12:18:42  <janzert> you would still use the matching algorithm during the finals too
2011-03-01T12:19:09  <jmcarthur> i just don't know. i've never seen something like trueskill used in a tournament
2011-03-01T12:19:12  <jmcarthur> only for ladders

2011-03-01T12:21:16  <janzert> so long as it's doing a good job at ranking it is working for the final tournament and if it's not then it's not really suitable for the open period either
2011-03-01T12:21:49  <janzert> another way to look at it is that I'm pretty sure handling the open period ranking well is strictly harder than the final tournament
2011-03-01T12:22:59  <amstan> McLeopold, janzert: anyone have any updates on readme.md?
2011-03-01T12:23:12  <amstan> i heard that worker was out of date

2011-03-01T12:23:36  <janzert> well, the installation instructions don't really make complete sense
2011-03-01T12:24:45  <amstan> janzert: should i just remove the worker part for now?
2011-03-01T12:26:06  <janzert> to me it looks mixed together between main and worker setup
2011-03-01T12:26:22  <janzert> certainly everything about ssh keys is no longer relevant
2011-03-01T12:27:05  <janzert> and the nproc limit stuff should be able to go away as well
2011-03-01T12:27:40  <amstan> janzert: i separated it a little: https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Readme
2011-03-01T12:28:07  <amstan> refresh
2011-03-01T12:28:20  <amstan> darn
2011-03-01T12:28:45  <janzert> that looks better anyway although I think it's lacking steps :)
2011-03-01T12:28:46  <amstan> i added a bullet point
2011-03-01T12:28:49  <amstan> well.. yeah
2011-03-01T12:29:29  <janzert> really the worker setup should be run game_server_build.sh on a plain ubuntu install
2011-03-01T12:29:36  <janzert> but that is broken right now
2011-03-01T12:29:40  <amstan> ...
2011-03-01T12:29:42  <amstan> lol
2011-03-01T12:29:53  <amstan> ok.. well
2011-03-01T12:30:07  <amstan> someone should go fix that, i just wanted to remove the false stuff from there

2011-03-01T12:30:42  <janzert> and also change it so it will work on the same machine as a main server install

2011-03-01T12:48:37  <jmcarthur> i did, but then the I/O protocol changed
2011-03-01T12:48:54  <jmcarthur> i think antimatroid's starter is up to date with it though, maybe
2011-03-01T12:49:11  <jmcarthur> McLeopold had a few in ants/bots before, but i don't know if they are up to date
2011-03-01T12:49:30  <jmcarthur> or if there are even in the same place now
2011-03-01T12:49:35  <jmcarthur> lots of changes last night that i didn't follow
2011-03-01T12:49:41  <jmcarthur> *if they are
2011-03-01T12:50:48  <jmcarthur> are we sandboxing the compilers this time?
2011-03-01T12:52:42  <janzert> amstan is it possible for the trueskill package to live in the manager directory?
2011-03-01T12:53:43  <janzert> I think everything that needs it will be there and if it's a subdirectory then it should be able to be directly imported
2011-03-01T12:55:58  <amstan> janzert: yes

2011-03-01T15:49:05  <amstan> Prillicy: so.. what was changed?
2011-03-01T15:51:32  <Prillicy> as I said, what I fixed was the large number of times it should have caught it and didn't.  If you are concerned about differentiating between real spammers and fake ones, there's a change I could make to it, custom for you, to check if a user appears a certain # of times instead of my current check, if they appear at all
2011-03-01T15:51:41  <Prillicy> but a username like sweet I'm sure will always get caught
2011-03-01T15:52:28  <amstan> i disagree
2011-03-01T15:52:39  <amstan> you should only filter by username if it's a really obscure username
2011-03-01T15:52:45  <amstan> not something as common as sweet
2011-03-01T15:53:14  <Prillicy> I could turn of username checks
2011-03-01T15:53:18  <Prillicy> leaving ip & emails only
2011-03-01T15:53:32  <Prillicy> or emails only if you really want, it would catch less, but you'd get almost no false positives
2011-03-01T15:55:04  <amstan> Prillicy: can you find out how to create a user?

2011-03-01T15:56:34  <Prillicy> you mean, the admins have to create users?
2011-03-01T15:56:39  <amstan> no
2011-03-01T15:56:48  <amstan> i mean that they must have a normal site user to make a forum one

2011-03-01T15:57:17  <amstan> that's trivial
2011-03-01T15:57:31  <Prillicy> not as much as you'd think
2011-03-01T15:57:33  <amstan> it's just an include..

2011-03-01T15:58:08  <Prillicy> my site's "user" check uses the cookie from phpbb

2011-03-01T16:01:57  <_flag> What if you add a hidden element to the page that must be left un-checked? That should at least defeat the non-specific ones
2011-03-01T16:02:54  <amstan> _flag: i'll probably get to that, once i get the forums in git
2011-03-01T16:03:07  <Prillicy> a good trick I heard was to leave a question to which hte correct answer was to leave the box blank
2011-03-01T16:03:18  <Prillicy> like "please leave the following box alone and move on"
2011-03-01T16:03:22  <amstan> Prillicy: that just confuses ppl
2011-03-01T16:03:33  <Prillicy> lol
2011-03-01T16:03:36  <_flag> This is exactly the same Prillicy, except you just don't show the box
2011-03-01T16:03:53  <_flag> The computer can't "see" what elements are actually on the page, it just fills everything out
2011-03-01T16:03:55  <Prillicy> right, but amstan isn't much of a web-coder from the sounds of things
2011-03-01T16:04:03  <amstan> _flag: so... we have email registration, recaptcha, and stop forum spam scripts going.. and it's still a ton of people
2011-03-01T16:04:16  <amstan> Prillicy: nah, i'm good
2011-03-01T16:04:23  <Prillicy> :P
2011-03-01T16:04:26  <_flag> style="position: absolute; left: - 100; right: -100;"
2011-03-01T16:04:33  <_flag> It's not even coding
2011-03-01T16:04:35  <amstan> Prillicy: i just hate most of the ways phpbb does stuff, so i try not to touch it
2011-03-01T16:04:41  <_flag> s/right/top
2011-03-01T16:04:42  <Prillicy> I agree
2011-03-01T16:05:01  <Prillicy> if you do choose to continue using mine, I recommend you switch to the new version
2011-03-01T16:05:03  <amstan> yeah, i think i'll get git on the forums
2011-03-01T16:07:25  <Zannick> i'm disturbed that recaptcha is somehow not defeating the spam
2011-03-01T16:07:53  <amstan> Zannick: all you need is to take a screenshot, put it on a porn site, then when you get a reply back, complete it
2011-03-01T16:07:54  <Zannick> but it's probably being defeated by captcha farms
2011-03-01T16:07:59  <amstan> it only has to work 1% of the time
2011-03-01T16:08:25  <Zannick> amstan: it's more likely people are being paid pennies to fill out captchas
2011-03-01T16:08:30  <amstan> Zannick: or that
2011-03-01T16:09:09  <Zannick> the porn site thing is pretty rare
2011-03-01T16:09:45  <Zannick> from what the recaptcha guys have said in the past

2011-03-01T16:17:40  <amstan> Prillicy: i'm trying to see what stuff is specific to each forum and what stuff is general
2011-03-01T16:17:52  <amstan> Prillicy: it's probably only the writable stuff and config.php, right?
2011-03-01T16:18:12  <Prillicy> for phpbb?
2011-03-01T16:18:16  <amstan> yes
2011-03-01T16:18:26  <Prillicy> there's very little that's designed to be forum specific
2011-03-01T16:18:56  <Prillicy> any mods input are where changes start to be made, and of course, any time you add code yourself or use a different motif
2011-03-01T16:19:14  <Prillicy> so ys, you're probably right
2011-03-01T16:19:23  <Prillicy> that and the db of course
2011-03-01T16:20:09  <amstan> with db i won't bother
2011-03-01T16:21:55  <Prillicy> I'm going to create a version 2.0 when I get around to it that also stores the spammer info to your database so that a) you put less load on stopforumspam.com because your db will be able to catch and kick spammers, and b) if stopforumspam.com ever shuts down, you still have a list to work with
2011-03-01T16:22:58  <amstan> Prillicy: where can i find the list of folders that need to be readable again?
2011-03-01T16:23:03  <amstan> Prillicy: it says during install.. but..
2011-03-01T16:23:41  <Prillicy> I'm not used to setting read/write permissions, all of my stuff is on an XP server
2011-03-01T16:23:49  <Prillicy> so I have no friggin clue
2011-03-01T16:25:52  <Prillicy> I'm not a phpbb expert. They want me to make the install edit at least 3 files for them to approve my mod
2011-03-01T16:26:10  <amstan> wtf? why?
2011-03-01T16:26:48  <Prillicy> 1 for the mod, 1 for language pack so that there can be an error message in every language in case of failure, and 1 for ACP so that you can change it/turn it on/off from the Administration panel

2011-03-01T16:31:09  <amstan> that way uninstalling takes one command
2011-03-01T16:31:21  <Prillicy> so where is your server hosted?
2011-03-01T16:31:25  <amstan> server?
2011-03-01T16:31:29  <amstan> what server?
2011-03-01T16:31:44  <Prillicy> your website has to be hosted somewhere
2011-03-01T16:31:59  <amstan> which website?
2011-03-01T16:32:14  <Prillicy> let's start with whichever one hosts your forums
2011-03-01T16:32:22  <amstan> which forums? i have 2
2011-03-01T16:32:28  <Prillicy> the ones I care about?
2011-03-01T16:32:40  <amstan> hosted in the same place as the main contest server
2011-03-01T16:32:46  <Prillicy> which is.....
2011-03-01T16:32:53  <amstan> not sure about details of the hoster, all i know is that i have root
2011-03-01T16:32:55  <amstan> lol
2011-03-01T16:33:04  <Prillicy> a box? a hosting service?

2011-03-01T16:33:24  <Prillicy> hmm
2011-03-01T16:33:27  <Prillicy> odd

2011-03-01T16:34:10  <Prillicy> k, 'cause a while back I offered to upgrade your server and everyone told me you were hosted on a free cloud
2011-03-01T16:34:16  <amstan> Prillicy: as for hypertriangle/cubicmatter, it's in my closet
2011-03-01T16:34:24  <Prillicy> which is the wierdest fucking thing I've heard of
2011-03-01T16:34:31  <Prillicy> hmm
2011-03-01T16:34:33  <amstan> Prillicy: oh.. right.. the workers are in the cloud
2011-03-01T16:34:33  <Prillicy> interesting
2011-03-01T16:34:40  <amstan> amazon ec2
2011-03-01T16:34:53  <amstan> and we're thinking of moving the main server in the cloud too
2011-03-01T16:34:57  <amstan> it's cheaper
2011-03-01T16:35:05  <Prillicy> I'm sure

2011-03-01T16:36:53  <amstan> Prillicy: ideally something like this: https://gist.github.com/797936

2011-03-01T16:39:47  <antimatroid1> can i just say now i'm quite against leaving peoples rankings on a resubmit
2011-03-01T16:40:01  <Prillicy> ?
2011-03-01T16:40:04  <amstan> Prillicy: ok.. use pastebin then! i want the whole addition of your mod
2011-03-01T16:40:09  <amstan> Prillicy: a diff between no mod and mod
2011-03-01T16:40:15  <amstan> Prillicy: not just 3 lines
2011-03-01T16:40:20  <Prillicy> what?
2011-03-01T16:40:28  <antimatroid1> look at bix0r last time, it helped them artificially keep their ranking up which confused a lot of people when the final tournament ran and they played bots they hadn't in a while
2011-03-01T16:40:38  <amstan> Prillicy: act like i don't have your mod, paste your mod somewhere! in plaintext

2011-03-01T17:04:01  <amstan> antimatroid1: because you commited when you didn't have the latest version, so for a while there were 2 parallel versions at the same time, before you pushed, that pull merged them

2011-03-01T17:04:34  <antimatroid1> like i started moving across even the 5 minute guide which should be reusable across competitions anyway
2011-03-01T17:05:07  <amstan> antimatroid1: i don't think the 5 minute guide has anything about planet wars in there

2011-03-01T17:06:10  <amstan> antimatroid1: but feel free to make the new ones in github/wiki, they're easy to export to html
2011-03-01T17:06:39  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'll get onto that later today
2011-03-01T17:07:00  <antimatroid1> amstan: for the moment, people really ought to be able to make a starter bot with that as a guide and the example io on the specs page
2011-03-01T17:07:16  <antimatroid1> the specs page is up to date for everything except visualiser input right at the bottom

2011-03-01T18:05:43  <DanielVF> Thinking 'bout the rankings
2011-03-01T18:06:18  <DanielVF> Ranking players 1 to x, means that even if your bot is getting better
2011-03-01T18:06:32  <DanielVF> you will probably be moving down in the rankins
2011-03-01T18:06:41  <DanielVF> as the contest progresses.
2011-03-01T18:06:54  <DanielVF> Might be better to turn that around a bit.

2011-03-01T18:10:07  <DanielVF> No, nothing to do with ranking draws
2011-03-01T18:10:28  <DanielVF> just if a players ranking is the number they watch to see how well they are doing

2011-03-01T18:10:56  <DanielVF> it's almost always going to look like they are doing worse
2011-03-01T18:11:01  <DanielVF> as the contest goes by
2011-03-01T18:11:08  <DanielVF> because of new bots being added
2011-03-01T18:12:08  <antimatroid> how else are you meant to rank people?
2011-03-01T18:12:19  <antimatroid> i see what you mean, but i'd still want to see where i'm currently ranked
2011-03-01T18:14:10  <DanielVF> I'm wondering if we occasionally designate certain bots as benchmarks
2011-03-01T18:14:21  <DanielVF> and when you can consistently beat it
2011-03-01T18:14:25  <DanielVF> you go up a level
2011-03-01T18:14:48  <DanielVF> The first couple levels could be pretty easy
2011-03-01T18:15:10  <DanielVF> You should be able to move up two or three levels on your first day.
2011-03-01T18:17:28  <antimatroid> what and no rankings for levels?
2011-03-01T18:17:33  <antimatroid> i don't really like that to be honest :P
2011-03-01T18:17:57  <antimatroid> anyway, i have to run or i'll be late for class
2011-03-01T18:20:28  <DanielVF> no, you can still have rankings inside the level
2011-03-01T18:20:33  <DanielVF> but turn them around
2011-03-01T18:20:43  <DanielVF> so higher is better
2011-03-01T18:21:01  <antimatroid> hmmm, not sure i agree that'd be better
2011-03-01T18:21:12  <DanielVF> There can still be a global ranking, but it's just not the emphasized number
2011-03-01T18:21:51  <antimatroid> it could give people more incremental goals to achieve
2011-03-01T18:22:18  <DanielVF> right
2011-03-01T18:22:23  <janzert> think I prefer the global ranking as well
2011-03-01T18:22:42  <DanielVF> incremental achievements == happiness
2011-03-01T18:23:01  <janzert> global ranking is surely more incremental than any levels that are set up
2011-03-01T18:23:05  <Zannick> we can still show benchmark bots in the global ranking
2011-03-01T18:23:38  <antimatroid> i like that
2011-03-01T18:24:01  <antimatroid> that way you can compare yourself relative to the benchmark bots which aren't changing
2011-03-01T18:24:03  <DanielVF> janzert, the problem with global ranking, with 1# being best
2011-03-01T18:24:23  <DanielVF> is that the vast majority of players are almost always moving down
2011-03-01T18:24:31  <DanielVF> to worse
2011-03-01T18:24:34  <antimatroid> more reason to try harder
2011-03-01T18:24:51  <janzert> yes, but I think people completely understand that already
2011-03-01T18:24:54  <DanielVF> you make a bot, and it comes in at number 4,000
2011-03-01T18:25:03  <DanielVF> Then you make a better bot a week later
2011-03-01T18:25:08  <janzert> it's better to be 100 out of 4000 than 9 out of 10
2011-03-01T18:25:10  <antimatroid> i think that's something anyone should easily expect
2011-03-01T18:25:15  <DanielVF> and by now you are at 4500
2011-03-01T18:25:48  <Zannick> your old bot would have dropped further in the meanwhile
2011-03-01T18:25:54  <DanielVF> *nods*
2011-03-01T18:26:06  <DanielVF> But you don't really know how much better the new was than the old
2011-03-01T18:26:08  <Zannick> which you'd presumably notice
2011-03-01T18:26:22  <antimatroid> what if the main raink was your relative position
2011-03-01T18:26:24  <janzert> we could also display a percentile rank if wanted, but I don't think it's a big deal. I don't remember anyone ever complaining about it, and they complained about just about everything :)
2011-03-01T18:26:42  <antimatroid> ^^ that
2011-03-01T18:26:47  <DanielVF> and it rubs in that you aren't gonna win.
2011-03-01T18:27:00  <antimatroid> we have mega1 for that

2011-03-01T18:57:19  <jmcarthur> my take on the above discussion:  i always thought it would have been nice to fix hunterbot to 0 and have everybody else vary around it. with elo it could have been simply a factor to add or subtract. relative values would have remained the same, and your absolute number would actually mean something
2011-03-01T18:58:11  <jmcarthur> a positive number being how much better you are than hunterbot, and a negative one being how much worse you are than hunterbot

2011-03-01T19:09:33  <j3camero> We probably don't want to hand anyone a negative score.
2011-03-01T19:09:39  <j3camero> That's just demoralizing.
2011-03-01T19:23:11  <jmcarthur> well, then we just can't have a static baseline then, i guess
2011-03-01T19:23:43  <jmcarthur> what if the baseline was just *really* bad? like... go left no matter what?
2011-03-01T19:26:11  <jmcarthur> that might be too bad to be meaningful at all though
2011-03-01T19:29:09  <DanielVF> Yeah, base line could easily be a do-nothing
2011-03-01T19:29:16  <DanielVF> or just cap at zero
2011-03-01T19:29:22  <DanielVF> (floor)
2011-03-01T19:34:34  <jmcarthur> you mean if you're the same as or worse than the baseline you're zero?
2011-03-01T19:35:01  <jmcarthur> as long as the baseline is really bad that would be okay, but otherwise you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell you are improving until you surpass it
2011-03-01T19:36:46  <DanielVF> yeah
2011-03-01T19:37:03  <DanielVF> The zero level bot would be like something moving randomly
2011-03-01T19:37:09  <janzert> for planetwars it initially adjusted either the mean or median player to be 2000 elo, at the point where that made the worst player less than 0 I switched it so the worst player was always 0
2011-03-01T19:37:31  <janzert> and the bottom bots were the bots that just immediately crashed of course
2011-03-01T19:37:50  <janzert> so random movers are way above the worst possible :)
2011-03-01T19:38:13  <DanielVF> Yes but they should be the worst possible intelligence. :P
2011-03-01T19:38:29  <DanielVF> One of the things concerns me about trueskill - and would need testing to check
2011-03-01T19:38:43  <DanielVF> is that the best bots get better over the tounament
2011-03-01T19:38:46  <DanielVF> much much better
2011-03-01T19:39:16  <DanielVF> Wheres trueskill assumes a mostly static range of goodness and badness
2011-03-01T19:40:01  * DanielVF afk
2011-03-01T19:40:21  <jmcarthur> trueskill is intended for ranking, not for scoring
2011-03-01T19:43:09  <jmcarthur> man, i really want those graphs from the tron contest back
2011-03-01T19:43:13  <jmcarthur> those were the most motivating things ever
2011-03-01T19:43:31  <jmcarthur> anybody know what technology was behind those?
2011-03-01T19:50:19  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: for ranking, i'd like to official list to have a skill level and a rank
2011-03-01T19:50:33  <McLeopold> I'd like the skill level to be from 0 to 100
2011-03-01T19:50:40  <McLeopold> rank will depend on number of entries.
2011-03-01T19:50:59  <McLeopold> So, hunterbot, leftybot and so on can be in the list and have a skill level.
2011-03-01T19:51:46  <McLeopold> TrueSkill will stay a positive number.
2011-03-01T19:52:51  <McLeopold> DanielVF: I'm planning on ranking submissions, not players.  A single submission will have a static skill, only varying by it's competition.
2011-03-01T19:56:50  *** dlila <dlila!~dlila@CPE0014d1c9243c-CM001bd71cede2.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-01T19:57:22  <McLeopold> I'll also display a +/- number over a few benchmark bots.
2011-03-01T19:57:57  <McLeopold> So if you really need to know absolute improvement, you can check.
2011-03-01T19:58:23  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: so all submissions start at default mean and sigma?
2011-03-01T19:58:31  <McLeopold> 50 / 16.6667
2011-03-01T19:58:46  <jmcarthur> i mean resubmissions
2011-03-01T19:59:06  <McLeopold> Yes, but we can gear the first match toward people of you last submissions level.
2011-03-01T20:00:36  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: so, with multiple numbers being displayed (rank / skill / +- from hunter ), I'm conceding the fact that 1 number isn't going to give everyone the info they want to compare against.
2011-03-01T20:00:56  <McLeopold> Some care about rank, some absolute skill, some relative skill.
2011-03-01T20:01:35  <jmcarthur> what might be cool is for new submissions to play against the previous submission first. might help converge on accurate ranks more quickly, at least if your new bot is an improvement on your old one
2011-03-01T20:01:42  <McLeopold> The other thing we can do is continue to play 2 submissions for a player, so they can see the latest skill level against their last submission.
2011-03-01T20:01:54  <McLeopold> That's a good idea.
2011-03-01T20:02:04  <McLeopold> Maybe a 1v1 should be the test match?
2011-03-01T20:02:17  <jmcarthur> or maybe even your new bot against your n previous bots
2011-03-01T20:02:18  <janzert> one game doesn't give you much information
2011-03-01T20:02:19  <McLeopold> unless you last submission was a crash bot :)
2011-03-01T20:02:40  <jmcarthur> if it was a crash bot then it will be a fast, uninformative game ;)
2011-03-01T20:02:41  <McLeopold> janzert: the first game gives you the biggest drop in uncertainty
2011-03-01T20:03:16  <jmcarthur> anyway, might be neat to play a new bot against your past three bots in one match or something
2011-03-01T20:03:27  <McLeopold> it's also automatically gearing your first match against someone near your last rank...
2011-03-01T20:03:27  <janzert> of course, just that a loss against your previous submission doesn't actually mean a whole lot
2011-03-01T20:03:32  <jmcarthur> get a guess of the relative rank there, then move into the main games
2011-03-01T20:03:45  <jmcarthur> janzert: but a win against it means a ton
2011-03-01T20:03:52  <janzert> not really :)
2011-03-01T20:03:59  <jmcarthur> and a win against your last three means even more
2011-03-01T20:04:15  <McLeopold> maybe not janzert's bots...
2011-03-01T20:04:18  <janzert> self play is the worst way to check for improvement
2011-03-01T20:04:20  <jmcarthur> heh
2011-03-01T20:04:26  <jmcarthur> this isn't to check for improvement

2011-03-01T20:04:34  <McLeopold> true
2011-03-01T20:04:44  <jmcarthur> this is to get a reasonable guess of rank going for your first match against another player
2011-03-01T20:05:06  <McLeopold> You can miss big strategies, or not be prepared for different tactics, but you still get some idea.
2011-03-01T20:05:18  <jmcarthur> this would be particularly helpful for the top 50% of players
2011-03-01T20:05:20  <McLeopold> Also, the previous bots will have been ranked against other people as well.
2011-03-01T20:05:22  <janzert> look at go programmers, chess programmers or most any place where people spend lots of time working on game playing programs
2011-03-01T20:05:36  <janzert> they all seem to agree that self play is a really bad measure
2011-03-01T20:05:38  <jmcarthur> i'm comparing this against just starting at the bottom
2011-03-01T20:05:50  <jmcarthur> if you beat the worst players, that's not helping to determine your rank much
2011-03-01T20:06:02  <janzert> yeah, for sure don't start at the bottom
2011-03-01T20:06:12  <janzert> at the worst case start at the median
2011-03-01T20:06:23  <jmcarthur> well actually trueskill would do that

2011-03-01T20:06:31  <janzert> yep

2011-03-01T20:07:06  <McLeopold> we just need a more sophisticated way to display ranks of a player with multiple submissions
2011-03-01T20:07:09  <jmcarthur> but with statistical models and stuff
2011-03-01T20:07:18  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: hm?
2011-03-01T20:07:21  <McLeopold> We aren't going to find an answer for the perfect number after a few games.
2011-03-01T20:07:26  <jmcarthur> i'm fine with resubmissions dropping your visible rank to zero
2011-03-01T20:07:44  <McLeopold> I'm not
2011-03-01T20:07:56  <jmcarthur> if you're going to show skill as a separate number anyway, though...
2011-03-01T20:08:18  <McLeopold> I want to see the last "real" rank of mega1 and other top contenders as their new submissions are being proven.
2011-03-01T20:08:21  <jmcarthur> oh right, we're resetting mu, too
2011-03-01T20:08:54  <jmcarthur> i really liked the graphs from tron :\
2011-03-01T20:08:55  <McLeopold> So, I'm not just concerned about my rank, but I want the ladder to be somewhat consistent.
2011-03-01T20:09:06  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: do you have images to share?
2011-03-01T20:09:07  <jbroman> One solution would be to leave mu. Another would be to hold the old rank until a set number of matches have been played by the new submission.
2011-03-01T20:09:16  <jmcarthur> nope
2011-03-01T20:09:23  <jmcarthur> they were basically just showing your rank over time
2011-03-01T20:09:28  <jmcarthur> with drops at resubmissions
2011-03-01T20:09:41  <jmcarthur> but it still showed past ranks, so it wasn't frustrating or something
2011-03-01T20:09:47  <McLeopold> jbroman: what I'm saying is, start the new submission at ground zero, but the rankings display can be smarter about showing ranks of past submissions.
2011-03-01T20:10:06  <McLeopold> We don't need to find a solution to quickly ranking new bots.
2011-03-01T20:10:25  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: my database design will have that
2011-03-01T20:10:30  <jbroman> McLeopold: Sorry; I meant to agree that it is a valid solution.
2011-03-01T20:10:42  <McLeopold> ah, ok
2011-03-01T20:10:58  <McLeopold> I understand you now.
2011-03-01T20:11:04  <jmcarthur> i'm wondering if there is any *principled* way to do it
2011-03-01T20:11:18  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: each game records a bots before and after mu and sigma
2011-03-01T20:11:45  <jmcarthur> i mean about your rank immediately after resubmitting
2011-03-01T20:12:03  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: nice that the db has that. we can use it
2011-03-01T20:12:10  <McLeopold> full round-robin?
2011-03-01T20:12:32  <jmcarthur> hmm?
2011-03-01T20:12:40  <jmcarthur> oh you mean of your own bots?
2011-03-01T20:12:52  <jmcarthur> that seems a bit heavy

2011-03-01T20:13:18  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-03-01T20:14:01  <jmcarthur> how about an option to toggle showing current submissions only or *all* submissions?
2011-03-01T20:14:24  <McLeopold> I would like that.  If we can make it fast.
2011-03-01T20:14:28  <jmcarthur> and maybe if there is a run of a bunch of the same contestant's bots they get compressed into one
2011-03-01T20:15:12  <jmcarthur> or perhaps the last n submissions instead?
2011-03-01T20:15:18  <jmcarthur> for some n chosen to be efficient enough
2011-03-01T20:15:21  <McLeopold> last n would work
2011-03-01T20:15:32  <McLeopold> we move data to archive tables for speed
2011-03-01T20:15:54  <McLeopold> last n would be vastly different for different people
2011-03-01T20:16:00  <jmcarthur> yeah...

2011-03-01T20:17:27  <jmcarthur> because surely a day is long enough to converge on a reasonable rank anyway
2011-03-01T20:17:43  <McLeopold> maybe based on the gpm
2011-03-01T20:18:06  <McLeopold> last 20 games * contestants
2011-03-01T20:18:29  <jmcarthur> i'm hesitant to allow things like gpm to artifically affect visible rankings like that
2011-03-01T20:19:07  <McLeopold> I'm only suggesting bots that played in that timeframe are displayed.  mu and sigma are not affected
2011-03-01T20:19:21  <jmcarthur> yeah i know
2011-03-01T20:19:56  <McLeopold> the "full list" of submissions won't have "official" ranks
2011-03-01T20:20:09  <McLeopold> just skill, and distance from hunter
2011-03-01T20:20:18  <McLeopold> they will be in skill order
2011-03-01T20:20:41  <jmcarthur> well, here's an idea... how about each submission has its own stats like we've been planning, but also each player has another trueskill score. it has no affect on matchmaking or anything, but it can be used to rank players against each other
2011-03-01T20:20:55  <jmcarthur> and that score never changes even with resubmissions
2011-03-01T20:21:06  <McLeopold> we can record the data
2011-03-01T20:21:08  <jmcarthur> well, i mean it changes for each game of course
2011-03-01T20:21:13  <McLeopold> I'm not sure how useful it would be
2011-03-01T20:21:32  <jmcarthur> well it sounds like you are just wanting to prevent huge jumps in skill upon resubmission
2011-03-01T20:21:37  <jmcarthur> this would do that
2011-03-01T20:21:44  <McLeopold> not really
2011-03-01T20:21:45  <jmcarthur> on a player basis, not a bot basis

2011-03-01T20:21:58  <McLeopold> I'm not thinking I want to prevent anything?
2011-03-01T20:22:24  <jmcarthur> you were wanting to prevent a player's rank from dropping to zero, no?
2011-03-01T20:22:27  <McLeopold> I want the leader board to appear stable, even while resubmits are occuring.
2011-03-01T20:22:30  <jmcarthur> right
2011-03-01T20:22:41  <jmcarthur> this would make for a stable leaderboard
2011-03-01T20:22:56  <McLeopold> but perhaps more inaccurate
2011-03-01T20:23:08  <jmcarthur> that's what you get for stability
2011-03-01T20:23:34  <jmcarthur> the player skill could perhaps be based on the last n games that the player had (recomputing the trueskill based on those or something)
2011-03-01T20:23:35  <McLeopold> how about this, a bot highest skill level and current submission are show...
2011-03-01T20:23:52  <McLeopold> and the non-current one has is flagged "retired"
2011-03-01T20:24:22  <McLeopold> at some point, if the new one becomes the highest, you only display 1
2011-03-01T20:24:28  <jmcarthur> only meaningful if skill levels were absolute instead of relative
2011-03-01T20:24:44  <jmcarthur> since the retired one plays no more games and the scale can change
2011-03-01T20:24:56  <McLeopold> the scale doesn't change
2011-03-01T20:25:27  <McLeopold> skill is essentially percentile
2011-03-01T20:25:36  <jmcarthur> i just mean that if you're a level 95 bot today that doesn't mean the same bot should be level 95 a week from now
2011-03-01T20:25:53  <jmcarthur> exactly. it's relative
2011-03-01T20:26:06  <McLeopold> right, but at some point, the retired submission will be removed
2011-03-01T20:26:22  <McLeopold> it's only useful until the new bot converges
2011-03-01T20:26:59  <jmcarthur> "a bot highest skill level and current submission"  <-- sounded like you don't just show the previous bot, but you show the highest ranking bot the player submitted of all time
2011-03-01T20:27:19  <McLeopold> well, you show both, so you can see your new one climb
2011-03-01T20:27:20  <jmcarthur> i would agree with showing the most recently retired bot
2011-03-01T20:27:28  <jmcarthur> not the higher of all time
2011-03-01T20:27:30  <jmcarthur> *highest
2011-03-01T20:27:40  <McLeopold> yes, that's what I meant
2011-03-01T20:27:43  <jmcarthur> okay
2011-03-01T20:27:46  <jmcarthur> it was a misunderstanding then
2011-03-01T20:27:52  <jmcarthur> i'm fine with this
2011-03-01T20:28:05  <jmcarthur> that's basically like my "last n" proposal
2011-03-01T20:28:08  <jmcarthur> for n = 1
2011-03-01T20:28:27  <McLeopold> the retired bot can also be removed from the rankings, so you just see them in the right position, but they don't get a number
2011-03-01T20:28:43  <McLeopold> yes, but only 1 of the last n?
2011-03-01T20:28:48  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-03-01T20:29:06  <jmcarthur> wait, what?
2011-03-01T20:30:18  <McLeopold> 1) McLeopold (v2)
2011-03-01T20:30:18  <McLeopold> *) McLeopold (v1 *retired*)

2011-03-01T20:30:22  <McLeopold> like that ^^
2011-03-01T20:30:42  <jmcarthur> i was questioning what you meant by "yes, but only 1 of the last n?"
2011-03-01T20:30:47  <McLeopold> oh
2011-03-01T20:31:09  <McLeopold> show current bot and highest of last n bots
2011-03-01T20:31:18  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-03-01T20:31:32  <jmcarthur> yes, but i think it should be by time instead of number
2011-03-01T20:31:42  <jmcarthur> show current bot and highest of last day or so
2011-03-01T20:32:05  <McLeopold> yeah, okay, whatever turns out to be the time for bots to converge correctly

2011-03-01T20:33:14  <jmcarthur> amstan: what technology was powering the rank-over-time graphs in the tron contest, and why were they pulled? were they just too slow?
2011-03-01T20:34:00  <amstan> jmcarthur: it was just elo
2011-03-01T20:34:06  <McLeopold> So I think this would be good.  We aren't trying to solve the problem of a perfect number to start new bots on, and people can watch new submissions climb, plus see, in general, where they and their opponents will probably end up on the ladder.
2011-03-01T20:34:33  <jmcarthur> amstan: no, like the images that were generated
2011-03-01T20:34:45  <jmcarthur> (and it wasn't elo at the time, either)
2011-03-01T20:34:46  <McLeopold> Assuming the new bot is near the old one.  Which is a good assumptions.
2011-03-01T20:34:48  <amstan> jmcarthur: what graphs then? the visual;izer?
2011-03-01T20:35:00  <jmcarthur> amstan: no, like... it showed your rank as time went by

2011-03-01T20:36:02  <jbroman> spelling :)
2011-03-01T20:36:05  <jmcarthur> or something like them
2011-03-01T20:36:17  <j3camero> jmcarthur: I pulled the rank-over-time charts because I thought they were causing trouble with overloading the database. In retrospect that probably wasn't true.
2011-03-01T20:36:30  <McLeopold> j3camero: they won't be this time
2011-03-01T20:36:55  <McLeopold> But, if we could have a visualizer, so we just push some data, that would be nice.
2011-03-01T20:36:56  <j3camero> Yeah I know. Especially with caching and such.
2011-03-01T20:36:58  <jmcarthur> it was nice because as soon as you submitted the starter, your graph started going
2011-03-01T20:37:06  <jmcarthur> and then you just *have* to improve it

2011-03-01T20:52:39  <McLeopold> this is to take a base ubuntu 10.10 server install and turn it into a main server
2011-03-01T20:52:41  <amstan> how about a python installer?
2011-03-01T20:52:42  <janzert> ahh, I thought you meant you had a worker one as well
2011-03-01T20:53:00  <McLeopold> amstan: sudo apt-get install python?
2011-03-01T20:53:18  <amstan> McLeopold: no, python is usually already installed on ubuntus
2011-03-01T20:53:35  <McLeopold> oh, write the script in python?
2011-03-01T20:53:47  <amstan> McLeopold: usually python libraries and stuff have a setup.py script, i think it's a standard thing
2011-03-01T20:53:47  <janzert> only reason is it's easier to run shell commands from a shell script :)
2011-03-01T20:53:47  <McLeopold> do we care about supporting windows?
2011-03-01T20:54:03  <janzert> not to run a server off of I don't think
2011-03-01T20:54:12  <McLeopold> yeah, I would still with shell scripts
2011-03-01T20:54:46  <janzert> I have been tempted to use fabric though http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.4/
2011-03-01T20:54:58  <janzert> but it's probably overkill
2011-03-01T20:55:03  <McLeopold> janzert: actually that link is really no good.  I've got a bunch of support files I haven't check in or made references to
2011-03-01T20:55:45  <janzert> ok, don't worry I'm not planning on working automating the main server setup right now
2011-03-01T20:56:19  <McLeopold> okay, I'll pull it later and try it out.
2011-03-01T20:56:26  <McLeopold> I'm going to continue on the sql changes.
2011-03-01T20:56:38  <McLeopold> janzert: make sure jeff can use it. :)

2011-03-01T20:59:27  <amstan> pyro-: it's totally up to you
2011-03-01T20:59:55  <pyro-> i don't have access to your server?
2011-03-01T21:00:36  <pyro-> install mit-scheme?
2011-03-01T21:00:39  <amstan> pyro-: so if you say you need version X, and it's possible to get version X on latest ubuntu, we'll get version X
2011-03-01T21:01:12  <janzert> and the easier it is to get version X onto latest ubuntu the more likely it is to happen
2011-03-01T21:01:43  <j3camero> For sure.
2011-03-01T21:01:55  <j3camero> Also, it has to not cause problems for novices.

2011-03-01T21:02:35  <janzert> sorry, I almost certainly won't be doing it so for sure can't guarantee anything
2011-03-01T21:02:49  <amstan> there's a mit-scheme-doc in the repo, but no mit-scheme
2011-03-01T21:03:00  <pyro-> np me neither. im looking from a garentee from the organisers not randoms lol
2011-03-01T21:03:02  <j3camero> pyro: any reason why people would prefer MIT Scheme over the seemingly much more popular Racket?
2011-03-01T21:03:10  <janzert> that's weird
2011-03-01T21:03:11  <pyro-> j3camero: slow
2011-03-01T21:03:30  <amstan> pyro-: amstan, j3camero qualify as organizers
2011-03-01T21:03:51  <Zannick> hm, my ubuntu seems to know about mit-scheme-doc but not mit-scheme
2011-03-01T21:03:57  <amstan> Zannick: yeah, same
2011-03-01T21:04:17  <pyro-> amstan/ j3camero: you don't have to use your package manager for everything no? http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-user/Unix-Installation.html
2011-03-01T21:04:30  <amstan> pyro-: no, but it's nicer when it is
2011-03-01T21:05:07  <Zannick> gnu has mit-scheme binaries but i wouldn't necessary feel comfortable with that
2011-03-01T21:05:18  <Zannick> relying on archs
2011-03-01T21:05:31  <j3camero> I see. Here's the thing. If MIT Scheme differs from Racket in any significant way, then we probably have to go with Racket. There are two competing criteria here. One is speed for the power users, the other is the risk of infuriating incompatibilities that cause novices to give up. I am picturing a situation where a 1st year Waterloo student who has learned Racket in their classes complains "my code works on my machine, why does it throw an error and get
2011-03-01T21:05:34  <amstan> debian also has the same problem: http://pkgs.org/debian-squeeze/debian-nonfree-i386/mit-scheme-doc_9.0.1-1_all.deb.html
2011-03-01T21:06:08  <pyro-> man this is tiring. you told me earlier if i said i needed version x you get it. i specify mit-scheme 9.0.1 and you start talking about racket. i don't give a shit what you use, but if you are going to make the decision yourself please make it and stop asking me
2011-03-01T21:06:22  <Zannick> 2006-04-16 split off from mit-scheme package
2011-03-01T21:06:24  <jmcarthur> now two scheme implementations are really the same. scheme programmers just have to suck it up anyway. might as well go with a decent one
2011-03-01T21:06:31  <jmcarthur> *no two
2011-03-01T21:06:44  <Zannick> seems to imply that there should be one
2011-03-01T21:06:46  <pyro-> jmcarthur: exaxctly so :)
2011-03-01T21:07:47  <Zannick> packages.ubuntu.com has mit-scheme
2011-03-01T21:08:00  <jbroman> Zannick: not on amd64, sadly
2011-03-01T21:08:08  <amstan> jbroman: oh, that's why!
2011-03-01T21:08:19  <Zannick> jbroman: aha
2011-03-01T21:08:26  <Zannick> that would explain it
2011-03-01T21:09:25  *** Prillicy <Prillicy!~chatzilla@97.104.27.168> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2011-03-01T21:09:54  <amstan> i just had my friend call it "Sheem"
2011-03-01T21:10:21  <amstan> wow, lol
2011-03-01T21:10:37  <j3camero> I don't know much about the scheme world or various flavors of scheme, but as always I am tempted to go with whatever is most likely to be used by a novice programmer.
2011-03-01T21:10:53  <jbroman> We could always offer two versions.
2011-03-01T21:11:11  <jbroman> (e.g. .rkt -> Racket, .ss -> MIT Scheme)
2011-03-01T21:11:15  <Zannick> we'd need a way to differentiate, efb
2011-03-01T21:11:36  <j3camero> If we let people submit shell-script entries then people could submit shell scripts of the form "racket mybot.ss" or "mit-scheme mybot.ss" if they had a strong preference. I think that would be reasonable. Anyone see a problem?
2011-03-01T21:12:09  <Zannick> j3camero: that requires that "racket" and "mit-scheme" be valid commands
2011-03-01T21:12:30  <j3camero> What is the standard command for launching a scheme program?
2011-03-01T21:12:34  <jbroman> j3camero: I'd prefer using file extensions, or maybe some sort of Marker file.
2011-03-01T21:12:36  <Zannick> and that requires specific instructions for scheme
2011-03-01T21:12:42  <pyro-> j3camero: there isn't one
2011-03-01T21:12:49  <j3camero> Is ti compiled?
2011-03-01T21:12:59  <pyro-> j3camero: sometimes
2011-03-01T21:13:07  <pyro-> depends on your implementation
2011-03-01T21:13:18  <jbroman> j3camero: Scheme is a language only; how it's evaluated is completely implementation-dependent.
2011-03-01T21:13:19  <pyro-> 'is why i cant start writing until someone tells me what to use
2011-03-01T21:13:38  <Zannick> yeah :/
2011-03-01T21:13:53  <pyro-> on most modern systems you should be able to do #!/usr/bin/env scheme-script
2011-03-01T21:14:28  <pyro-> implementations are supposed to install a wrapper program called scheme-script which points to itself
2011-03-01T21:14:53  <j3camero> Okay. What I am getting is that it would be possible to have both side by side.
2011-03-01T21:15:04  <pyro-> but locally i always put #!/usr/bin/env ikarus
2011-03-01T21:15:27  <amstan> j3camero: yeah.. but that would require run_anything.py to not actually prepent the commands with the executable
2011-03-01T21:15:30  <Zannick> that probably won't matter, since we don't execute scripts
2011-03-01T21:15:41  <Zannick> we pass them to interpreters
2011-03-01T21:15:44  <amstan> j3camero: just chmod +x the file, then let the file have a #! line
2011-03-01T21:15:54  <Zannick> but
2011-03-01T21:15:56  <amstan> Zannick: we should be executing them though
2011-03-01T21:15:58  <Zannick> that doesn't mean we can't
2011-03-01T21:15:59  <jmcarthur> j3camero: does this shell script idea imply that we will be able to do arbitrary binaries, too?
2011-03-01T21:16:34  <j3camero> Whatever is cool with me, as long as the standard file extension causes the scripts to get run as the most popular scheme implementation. If a few power users want something different, they should have to change their file extensions. Novices should get the behavior that they expect unless they do something unexpected.
2011-03-01T21:16:42  <Zannick> at the very least, if we do this, we also ought to allow shell scripts
2011-03-01T21:17:16  <Zannick> most popular being...?
2011-03-01T21:17:31  <jmcarthur> allowing binaries would sidestep this issue for any compiled language, basically
2011-03-01T21:17:40  <j3camero> jmcarthur: you always could submit binaries. Remember last time? Did you try submitting a python script that does os.system("./MyBot")?
2011-03-01T21:17:52  <jmcarthur> j3camero: i never did, no
2011-03-01T21:18:07  <j3camero> I bet anything it would have worked. I never put anything in that would forbid this.
2011-03-01T21:18:08  <jbroman> (exec would be nicer, and probably hook up pipes better)
2011-03-01T21:18:29  <j3camero> jbroman: probably yes.
2011-03-01T21:18:33  <jbroman> That said, we might as well officially support binary submissions if we want to do that.
2011-03-01T21:18:41  <Zannick> yeah, piping might prove difficult with that
2011-03-01T21:18:46  <jbroman> (trivial way would be to say that the extension ".bin" means binary)
2011-03-01T21:18:52  <Zannick> and there might be subprocess rules in place
2011-03-01T21:18:55  <jmcarthur> it's just that i'd like to at least have some official claim that it's *okay* and *supported* to do that
2011-03-01T21:19:18  <amstan> j3camero: no... this is why we have starter packages..
2011-03-01T21:19:23  <j3camero> jbroman: I hate the idea of officially supporting binary submissions. It means we have to commit to a certain architecture for the game servers. Maybe some day we will want to use many different architectures?
2011-03-01T21:19:29  <amstan> j3camero: if they delete the #! line, that's there problem
2011-03-01T21:19:43  <amstan> their*
2011-03-01T21:19:58  <jbroman> j3camero: That was my opposition as well. But if you're going to give tacit approval, might as well implement it properly. Otherwise say "Unsupported, at your own risk".
2011-03-01T21:20:02  <j3camero> amstan: okay cool that works, as long as scheme is generally interpreted instead of compiled.
2011-03-01T21:20:03  <Zannick> we're already trying to commit to a fixed architecture for fairness and ease of worker setup
2011-03-01T21:20:12  <jmcarthur> jbroman++
2011-03-01T21:20:26  <pyro-> j3camero: scheme is not generally anything
2011-03-01T21:20:37  <j3camero> jbroman: unsupported at your own risk is what I want, I believe. I think that makes sense, given that we could very well switch architectures at any time.
2011-03-01T21:20:39  <pyro-> there is no dominant implementation
2011-03-01T21:20:39  <jmcarthur> we need to say it's officially supported or officially unsupported, not "try it if you want"
2011-03-01T21:21:34  <jmcarthur> j3camero: implementation choice is a major decision and i wouldn't want to make it without a high level of assurance that it will still work by the time the two or three month contest is over
2011-03-01T21:21:48  <jbroman> I think Racket and MIT Scheme is probably enough, and Racket recommends the .rkt extension anyways so there's no difficulty choosing the correct one.
2011-03-01T21:22:11  <j3camero> jbroman: cool.
2011-03-01T21:22:19  <jbroman> </two-cents>
2011-03-01T21:22:37  <pyro-> (racket is a different language but it comes with a scheme compiler called plt-r6rs)
2011-03-01T21:22:41  <jmcarthur> and i just think that the benefits (no real need to support specific implementations of any compiled language) outweight the downsides (uniform architecture requirements for the duration of the contest)
2011-03-01T21:22:48  <jmcarthur> *outweigh
2011-03-01T21:23:08  <pyro-> racket is a derivitive of scheme
2011-03-01T21:23:26  <jbroman> pyro-: Most of the "newbie" people that Jeff is concerned about won't be using that – they'd want Racket proper. Otherwise, I'd think choosing some preferred Scheme implementation for .ss is fine.
2011-03-01T21:23:48  <jbroman> I got the impression that MIT Scheme was generally acceptable, but if plt-r6rs is better for n reasons, that could be substituted.
2011-03-01T21:23:48  <pyro-> yep
2011-03-01T21:24:23  <pyro-> jbroman: plt is slower
2011-03-01T21:24:32  <jbroman> Hence MIT Scheme.
2011-03-01T21:24:36  <pyro-> :)

2011-03-01T21:24:53  <pyro-> anyway my point above was
2011-03-01T21:25:05  <jbroman> (As long as it's possible to run mit-scheme on amd64 – never tried this myself.)
2011-03-01T21:25:12  <pyro-> supporting racket is not to support scheme, its a scheme derivitive
2011-03-01T21:25:24  <pyro-> so its not like you'd have to schemes if you put mit-scheme as well

2011-03-01T21:26:53  <Zannick> i assume it is, given the source
2011-03-01T21:27:17  <jbroman> Zannick: It turns out they even provide a binary. So in any case, building a .deb is quite doable.
2011-03-01T21:27:17  <Zannick> i don't think we want to build from source per worker, of course
2011-03-01T21:29:41  <j3camero> jmcarthur: I don't think it's smart for the contest to commit to a specific architecture for the game servers. For one, it stops us from doing any cool things like decentralized game servers. I don't think it's worth the admittedly awesome advantage of letting power users compile their own entries.
2011-03-01T21:30:23  <j3camero> I know that in this IRC channel, filled with only power users, that is never going to be a popular stance :-)
2011-03-01T21:30:31  <jbroman> In practice, I think uniformity is nice. But I'd also like the freedom to say "we guarantee nothing buy what is described here".
2011-03-01T21:30:40  <jbroman> s/buy/but/
2011-03-01T21:31:33  <j3camero> Well and suppose some organization has a large machine called corn-syrup that they want to lend the contest to bolster our games/minute throughput!

2011-03-01T21:37:27  <j3camero> I hate making promises, but it looks like we should be able to give you MIT scheme, pyro-. The caveat is that it's possible no one will feel like actually implementing said support. So you may have to clone the GitHub repo and make the changes yourself, then we will accept your patch.
2011-03-01T21:39:01  <j3camero> All you have to do is put compile and run rules into the two relevant scripts in the codebase. It's much more likely to happen if you send a pull request on GitHub. I love features where all I have to do is click Accept.
2011-03-01T21:40:48  <pyro-> yeah i've noticed you don't like making promises. in my view its perhaps not the best thing to have decisions outstanding and changes made beyond the open of any competition. that aside i'm unfortunatly not willing to work on your code (my time is going to be limited over the next few months) beyond starter packe writing. so perhaps i will look at writing an entry in python for real

2011-03-01T23:23:27  <McLeopold> Frontier: i thought you couldn't support ID?
2011-03-01T23:23:52  <McLeopold> *IE*
2011-03-01T23:27:28  <Frontier> McLeopold: Well.. that is the point. I'm using a JScript library from Google that generates a VML (~SVG from Microsoft) on the fly from the drawing commands. Surprisingly creating markup on the fly and modifying the DOM tree is not fast
2011-03-01T23:29:48  <Frontier> Well it was ok when I did not clear the vml each frame. but i cant really let the elements add up either. the buttons are semi transparent and maybe other stuff will be too so i should really clear each frame. adding even more complex code to decide when to clear and when not to clear would be an option ^^
2011-03-01T23:30:23  <McLeopold> maybe you could revert to a simple visualizer, like mine, for IE
2011-03-01T23:30:57  <janzert> McLeopold: no sorry
2011-03-01T23:31:15  <janzert> I got stuck on another problem at the moment
2011-03-01T23:31:24  <McLeopold> an aichallenge problem?
2011-03-01T23:31:37  <janzert> no, completely unrelated :(
2011-03-01T23:33:06  <Frontier> McLeopold: You are right, I'll just have to wait a day or two to realize that is the only way
2011-03-01T23:35:55  <pyro-> i wrote it amstan :D
2011-03-01T23:36:54  <McLeopold> pyro-: you got a scheme bot?
2011-03-01T23:37:10  <pyro-> nope
2011-03-01T23:37:24  *** SheV0 <SheV0!~chatzilla@97.104.27.168> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86-rdmsoft [XULRunner 1.9.2.10/20100914130356])
2011-03-01T23:37:30  <McLeopold> janzert: create_matchups fails to create matchups with only 2 bots in the system
2011-03-01T23:37:35  <pyro-> i feel likes its about the 10th time i've said it today but i cant write until i know what im writing for :D
2011-03-01T23:37:43  *** Prillicy <Prillicy!~chatzilla@97.104.27.168> has quit IRC (Quit: I be bangin')
2011-03-01T23:37:48  <McLeopold> so, what did you write?
2011-03-01T23:38:15  <pyro-> the issue amstan told me to :D
2011-03-01T23:39:00  <j3camero> pyro- I think we're all pretty much agreed that you can have your pick of either PLT or MIT scheme. The only caveat is that you might have to implement support for MIT yourself if nobody else cares enough.
2011-03-01T23:39:30  <McLeopold> pyro-: I have a test server.  I'm installing mit-scheme now.
2011-03-01T23:39:41  <McLeopold> if you write it, I will test it.
2011-03-01T23:40:13  <McLeopold> (9.0.1-1ubuntu1)
2011-03-01T23:41:00  <j3camero> You'll have to add the apt-get command to install MIT scheme to the server setup script, then also add MIT scheme support to the compile_anything.py script and run_anything.py script.
2011-03-01T23:41:07  <pyro-> j3camero: i haven't got time to work with caveats. McLeopold: yey :D i will write it to the wiki on github. is that page correct?
2011-03-01T23:41:27  <McLeopold> a scheme bot? no
2011-03-01T23:41:28  <pyro-> j3camero: maybe i can do that mutch. soudns easy
2011-03-01T23:42:10  <janzert> McLeopold: out of curiosity what was the error?
2011-03-01T23:42:16  <pyro-> McLeopold: is this page correct? https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Ants-Game-Specification
2011-03-01T23:42:50  <McLeopold> pyro-: for the specs to write against? yes
2011-03-01T23:42:56  <pyro-> :)

2011-03-01T23:43:30  <McLeopold> sry for the spam
2011-03-01T23:44:21  <pyro-> i will write it to that page and using mit-scheme. and i will assume that will work despite the general vagueness of answers im getting
2011-03-01T23:44:42  <McLeopold> pyro-: I'll test it, so you will know.
2011-03-01T23:46:05  <pyro-> okay :D
2011-03-01T23:49:14  <janzert> ahh, yeah
2011-03-01T23:50:26  <janzert> since they apparently already played a game against each other and the code won't repeat pairings within 50 games
2011-03-01T23:50:56  <janzert> the magic number to change is line 228, that is how many games to count as recent
2011-03-01T23:51:38  <janzert> it should have really been at least a constant but probably doesn't matter since you'll be throwing all that away anyway right? :)
2011-03-01T23:52:32  <McLeopold> I haven't played any games.
2011-03-01T23:53:31  <janzert> the games table is empty?
2011-03-01T23:54:00  <j3camero> McLeopold: do you have a magic main-server-setup script, or did you manually do a bunch of stuff to create a test server?
2011-03-01T23:54:52  <janzert> oh, I see the problem
2011-03-01T23:55:05  <janzert> actually the problem is that there have been no games played
2011-03-01T23:55:34  <janzert> a submission without any games was forced to play it's first game against a submission that has previous games
2011-03-01T23:55:42  <janzert> of course there aren't any with previous games
2011-03-01T23:56:38  <McLeopold> so, in choose opponent, instead of raising an error, I can fall back on unacceptable opponenets.
2011-03-01T23:57:01  <janzert> well, the acceptable opponents get wiped out on line 122, 123
2011-03-01T23:57:12  <amstan> McLeopold: so what's going on in your fork? you going to merge?
2011-03-01T23:57:27  <McLeopold> no, it's just a playground
2011-03-01T23:57:31  <janzert> store that list comprehension in a temporary variable, then if the result is empty keep the original
2011-03-01T23:57:51  <janzert> otherwise replace ranking with the new list
2011-03-01T23:59:57  <janzert> that will get you one game :/
