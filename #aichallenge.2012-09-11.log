2012-09-11T03:08:02  <mcstar> coursera has many more new offerings
2012-09-11T03:08:51  <mcstar> more reasons to sit in front of the computer and get atrophied
2012-09-11T03:09:12  <mcstar> i say NO to coursera!
2012-09-11T03:17:01  <mcstar> antimatroidl: i think this will attract many subscribers https://www.coursera.org/course/compinvesting1
2012-09-11T03:33:02  <antimatroidl> mcstar: myself included
2012-09-11T03:33:14  <mcstar> oh :(
2012-09-11T03:33:21  <mcstar> that wasnt my intention
2012-09-11T03:34:31  <mcstar> antimatroidl: btw, im dying to know how did your friend compute F_8 in 5 seconds...
2012-09-11T03:34:55  <antimatroidl> F_10 :P
2012-09-11T03:35:00  <antimatroidl> dunno
2012-09-11T03:35:31  <mcstar> yes, 10
2012-09-11T03:39:47  <mcstar> antimatroidl: your code would finish in 5.1 hours on my machine for F_10
2012-09-11T03:40:01  <mcstar> so, thats why im so eager to know, how could he make it in 5 seconds
2012-09-11T03:41:00  <mcstar> do you have my last paste?
2012-09-11T03:41:27  <mcstar> if you could look at it's main, thats where the diagrams are added to the set and a dequeue
2012-09-11T03:41:59  <mcstar> maybe that part is different, but the product itself, i dont see how it could be made more effiecient
2012-09-11T03:42:16  <mcstar> notwithstanding some math solution to the problem
2012-09-11T03:43:24  <antimatroidl> what are you doing to create the dictionary?
2012-09-11T03:43:35  <antimatroidl> you only need to multiply each new word by the generators
2012-09-11T03:46:07  <mcstar> http://hpaste.org/74561
2012-09-11T03:46:07  <mcstar> hm
2012-09-11T03:46:26  <mcstar> i multiply each new word with the contents of the dictionary
2012-09-11T03:46:37  <mcstar> (word->diagram)
2012-09-11T03:47:23  <antimatroidl> mcstar: try changing that :P

2012-09-11T04:06:13  <antimatroidl1> mcstar: :)
2012-09-11T04:07:08  <antimatroidl1> mcstar: does that match F_n from 3 to 11?
2012-09-11T04:07:14  <antimatroidl1> i wasn't expecting quite that much of a jump
2012-09-11T04:07:19  <mcstar> yeah
2012-09-11T04:07:39  <mcstar> it takes 6x more time for each successive n
2012-09-11T04:07:43  <mcstar> it was 20x before :(
2012-09-11T04:08:33  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: why didnt you? it incresed 5 fold, the cardinality
2012-09-11T04:09:01  <mcstar> increses*
2012-09-11T04:09:25  <antimatroidl1> mcstar: that's a lot more than 5 fold
2012-09-11T04:09:37  <antimatroidl1> F_11 is just over 100k yeah?
2012-09-11T04:10:02  <antimatroidl1> how long did that take?
2012-09-11T04:10:20  <mcstar> |F_13| = antimatroidl1 damn, im sorry, i have 2 output values, 1 is the cardinality, the other is the times the destructor of Diagram is called
2012-09-11T04:10:25  <mcstar> wait a bit
2012-09-11T04:10:41  <mcstar> |F_12| = 439249

2012-09-11T04:12:49  <thestinger> mcstar: I bet it will be at least a bit faster with pgo
2012-09-11T04:12:57  <antimatroidl1> so was your first one F_14?
2012-09-11T04:13:19  <mcstar> antimatroidl1: i never mentioned f_14
2012-09-11T04:13:31  <antimatroidl1> what's 4831749?

2012-09-11T04:14:03  <antimatroidl1> ah okay
2012-09-11T04:14:04  <mcstar> just a diagnostic number for me

2012-09-11T04:16:49  <mcstar> i dont even know what the term means
2012-09-11T04:17:15  <thestinger> mcstar: compile with -fprofile-generate
2012-09-11T04:17:18  <thestinger> run it on small n
2012-09-11T04:17:22  <thestinger> recompile with -fprofile-use
2012-09-11T04:17:38  <thestinger> it uses the knowledge of which branches are hot/cold etc., like a JIT

2012-09-11T05:58:46  <pwnworthy> for if the program finishes before I get a chance to see its memory usage?
2012-09-11T05:59:52  <mcstar> pwnworthy: http://hpaste.org/74581
2012-09-11T06:00:10  <mcstar> no, not really
2012-09-11T06:00:49  <mcstar> you can periodically ask for the memory use, and log that to a file
2012-09-11T06:00:55  <mcstar> or with 'less'
2012-09-11T06:01:50  <mcstar> now, i added a proper move constructor, a hash function for diagrams, unordered_set, and i store only iterators in the dequeue
2012-09-11T06:02:34  <mcstar> pwnworthy: there are compilation instruction on the bottom
2012-09-11T06:02:46  <mcstar> what thestinger told me, to use pgo
2012-09-11T06:03:03  <mcstar> it helps somewhat, noticeably
2012-09-11T06:05:42  <pwnworthy> ok I followed those instructions
2012-09-11T06:05:53  <pwnworthy> -fprofile-use makes it go faster
2012-09-11T06:05:58  <pwnworthy> what does that actually do?
2012-09-11T06:06:31  <pwnworthy> hmm ok nvm
2012-09-11T06:06:50  <mcstar> apparently, it uses a file that a previous run, after -fprofile-generate, generated, and somehow with that knowledge it can optimize hot code paths better
2012-09-11T06:07:01  <mcstar> so, basically, magic
2012-09-11T06:07:24  <pwnworthy> yeah sweet

2012-09-11T06:10:51  <pwnworthy> you can use "/usr/bin/time -v" to get more verbose information, such as peak memory usage and stuff

2012-09-11T06:11:18  <mcstar> oh, i never parameterized 'time'
2012-09-11T06:11:28  <mcstar> though, the time i use now, is zsh's own
2012-09-11T06:11:36  <pwnworthy> yeah same
2012-09-11T06:11:44  <pwnworthy> you have to go /usr/bin/time
2012-09-11T06:11:56  <pwnworthy> i just looked it up on stackoverflow
2012-09-11T06:14:06  <mcstar> well, for F_13, runtime rougly 1/3 less, but memory use went down only by 0.2%
2012-09-11T06:14:11  <mcstar> (of total memory)
2012-09-11T06:14:40  <mcstar> btw, the dict shouldnt really store the Diagrams though
2012-09-11T06:17:30  <mcstar> well, except if theres a hash-collision...

2012-09-11T06:27:12  <pwnworthy> mine was in a separate .deb package, so maybe you just need to install it
2012-09-11T06:27:35  <pwnworthy> OK, so it seems there were no hash collisions
2012-09-11T06:28:30  <pwnworthy> and the time was 650.76 (which is 56% of the time of the previous one)
2012-09-11T06:29:03  <pwnworthy> and it used 3.48GB of memory (but I didn't see what it got up to last time)
2012-09-11T06:35:55  <mcstar> thats too much memory, but i like the speed of it :)
2012-09-11T06:38:53  <antimatroidl> pwnworthy:  how much memory have you got?
2012-09-11T06:38:55  <mcstar> pwnworthy: wait, i just run for F_14, it took 800s, and used roughly 10% of my memory
2012-09-11T06:39:22  <pwnworthy> I have 8GB
2012-09-11T06:39:32  <mcstar> are those numbers for 15?
2012-09-11T06:39:44  <antimatroidl> yes
2012-09-11T06:39:52  <pwnworthy> my numbers were for F_15
2012-09-11T06:39:54  <mcstar> ah, ok then
2012-09-11T06:40:10  * antimatroidl is mostly ready for tomorrow early
2012-09-11T06:40:26  <mcstar> pwnworthy: i was confused, since i thought memory usage was >3GB for F_14 alrady
2012-09-11T06:41:10  <pwnworthy> ah no it got above 3.5GB on F_15 with the non-hashing algorithm
2012-09-11T06:41:27  <pwnworthy> this time just below 2.5GB
2012-09-11T06:41:30  <pwnworthy> *3.5GB
2012-09-11T06:41:50  <mcstar> yeah, the difference is negligible
2012-09-11T06:42:12  <pwnworthy> F_14: 828MB, 128.29s
2012-09-11T06:42:22  <mcstar> if you can guarantee no collisions somehow, you can eliminate storing the diagrams
2012-09-11T06:42:44  <pwnworthy> yeah hmm
2012-09-11T06:43:35  <antimatroidl> when generating the diagrams?
2012-09-11T06:43:37  <mcstar> not a free lunch though, only a readuction from 2xn bytes to 8-16 bytes
2012-09-11T06:43:42  <antimatroidl> good luck with that
2012-09-11T06:44:08  <pwnworthy> mcstar: so at the moment, each Diagram is 30 bytes (for F_15)?
2012-09-11T06:44:17  <mcstar> yes
2012-09-11T06:44:30  <mcstar> well, and an int
2012-09-11T06:44:33  <mcstar> that 4 bytes
2012-09-11T06:44:47  <pwnworthy> ok
2012-09-11T06:54:33  <mcstar> antimatroidl: it just occurred to me, that we could use a ternary search trie, that we've been messing with before
2012-09-11T06:54:53  <mcstar> it shares prefixes, and a diagram is basically a string
2012-09-11T06:55:19  <mcstar> i dont think i have a c++ implementation of it, only haskell and ocaml
2012-09-11T06:55:25  <mcstar> mleise has it in D
2012-09-11T07:07:12  <antimatroidl> wut?
2012-09-11T07:07:49  <antimatroidl> how exactly? :P
2012-09-11T07:08:00  <pwnworthy> ternary search trie's look mega
2012-09-11T07:10:59  <pwnworthy> mcstar: is this for the dict?

2012-09-11T07:17:02  <antimatroidl> spoke too soon
2012-09-11T07:19:21  <mcstar> ok, i added a ternary search tree
2012-09-11T07:19:37  <mcstar> but it doesnt give the right answers just now
2012-09-11T07:22:31  <mleise> are you optimizing something?
2012-09-11T07:23:27  <mcstar> i think the tree im using cirpples the ascii range
2012-09-11T07:23:32  <mcstar> i need full range...
2012-09-11T07:23:40  <mcstar> mleise: well, sort of
2012-09-11T07:24:00  <mcstar> we are like the early comutational researcher searching for Sophie-Germain primes
2012-09-11T07:26:33  <mleise> never heard of those
2012-09-11T07:29:34  <mleise> ok, so they are primes who result in another prime if you double them and add 1
