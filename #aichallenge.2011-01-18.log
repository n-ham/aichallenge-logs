2011-01-18T05:57:52  <antimatroid1> that was my point, i'm rather against what they have atm
2011-01-18T05:58:00  <antimatroid1> for ants that is
2011-01-18T05:58:35  <delt0r_> well i think stratego is an easy "random" bot and  a easy engine...
2011-01-18T05:58:52  <delt0r_> but even a half reasonable bot would be hard.
2011-01-18T05:59:14  <antimatroid1> my vote is for stratego out of what currently seems offered
2011-01-18T05:59:21  <delt0r_> me too
2011-01-18T05:59:24  <antimatroid1> amstan seems to think it's too hard
2011-01-18T05:59:46  <delt0r_> lets see why when he is back online...

2011-01-18T06:00:22  <antimatroid1> nice
2011-01-18T06:00:39  <delt0r_> cheap... so it may sux with connectivity...
2011-01-18T06:00:46  <delt0r_> we will see
2011-01-18T06:00:56  <delt0r_> 100EU for a whole year is really cheap
2011-01-18T06:01:22  <delt0r_> but then 15 hours later they havent activated it yet...
2011-01-18T06:01:22  <antimatroid1> i live off $250/au a fortnight most of the time
2011-01-18T06:01:28  <delt0r_> so not a good sign
2011-01-18T06:01:32  <antimatroid1> but i still live at home, so it's not that hard
2011-01-18T06:01:36  <delt0r_> oh to be a student
2011-01-18T06:01:43  <delt0r_> I remeber it well
2011-01-18T06:02:13  <delt0r_> I use to *make* my wife and daughter come to *anything* with free food... and eat up *fast*
2011-01-18T06:02:45  <antimatroid1> haha, you aren't a true uni student unless you love free food
2011-01-18T06:03:01  <delt0r_> well now i get some decent money...
2011-01-18T06:03:13  <delt0r_> I still turn up to anything with free beer and food
2011-01-18T06:03:20  <delt0r_> or just one or the other
2011-01-18T06:03:35  <delt0r_> you never really shake it off
2011-01-18T06:04:00  <Blkt> good day everyone
2011-01-18T06:04:20  <delt0r_> good day
2011-01-18T06:04:23  <delt0r_> i think
2011-01-18T06:04:41  <delt0r_> but i am at work... the snow is melting and its a lovely day outside....
2011-01-18T06:04:44  <delt0r_> thats not good
2011-01-18T06:04:56  <delt0r_> i should be skiing
2011-01-18T06:07:41  <antimatroid1> i wish we got enough snow to do that
2011-01-18T06:07:56  <antimatroid1> we get snow on top of a nearby mountain in the winter for a bit, but not enough for that
2011-01-18T06:08:09  <delt0r_> even NZ has snow
2011-01-18T06:08:17  <delt0r_> and less floods
2011-01-18T06:08:20  <delt0r_> or bush fires
2011-01-18T06:08:26  <delt0r_> but we have more possums
2011-01-18T06:08:36  <delt0r_> less kangaroos thankfully
2011-01-18T06:27:28  <antimatroid1> we don't really have kangaroos in tassie i don't think
2011-01-18T06:27:33  <antimatroid1> some wallabies, but nowhere near where i live
2011-01-18T06:27:54  <antimatroid1> they jump along the roads near where my mum lives in canberra

2011-01-18T09:20:21  <amstan_i> also.. stratego is like ants: it's better when there's more than 2 players
2011-01-18T09:21:42  <antimatroid1> rankings will be less stable i imagine
2011-01-18T09:21:57  <antimatroid1> and i'm yet to come across anyone who finds that ants game overly interesting

2011-01-18T09:24:06  <delt0r___> yes
2011-01-18T09:24:14  <delt0r___> a RTS type game..

2011-01-18T09:25:36  <antimatroid1> i'm keen, but it sounds more complicated than stratego

2011-01-18T09:37:12  <delt0r___> only the flag is a bit bright yellow drum thats full of nuts
2011-01-18T09:40:57  <Frontier> I just watched a video of someone playing Stratego. I like how you can set up traps around your flag :D, but who is going to create all the gfx for our game of ... what was it? Flags and sheep?
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> I wouldn't be interested
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> games like that i would just stick with chess or go

2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> in fact i like hidden information for games in general
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <antimatroid1> amstan_i: convince j3camero to do stratego
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> well i have a vps comming online soon
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> I could do my own one...
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> could get aobut ---what 3 players
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <antimatroid1> .. you may just end up "wasting" (minus fun) your time
2011-01-18T09:40:58  <delt0r___> at least i would get 3rd
2011-01-18T09:40:59  <delt0r___> me
2011-01-18T09:40:59  <delt0r___> I would do it
2011-01-18T09:40:59  <delt0r___> mite even learn js for a web version...
2011-01-18T09:40:59  <delt0r___> but first cut would be java
2011-01-18T09:41:03  * antimatroid1 puts his vote in for delt0r making visualiser 
2011-01-18T09:41:07  <antimatroid1> jbotmanager <3
2011-01-18T09:41:23  <delt0r___> a lot of people used it in the end
2011-01-18T09:41:26  <delt0r___> and it was pretty rough
2011-01-18T09:41:37  <antimatroid1> yes, but it was the best alternative
2011-01-18T09:41:50  <antimatroid1> just for functions
2011-01-18T09:41:57  <antimatroid1> tcp and human mode specifically

2011-01-18T09:44:06  <delt0r___> what did i miss
2011-01-18T09:44:11  * delt0r___ looks at the logs
2011-01-18T09:44:18  <amstan_i> antimatroid1, delt0r___ : he doesn't like the fact that there's multiple types of units
2011-01-18T09:44:44  <delt0r___> but there is not really... just one type with a "rank" property
2011-01-18T09:44:53  <delt0r___> honestly
2011-01-18T09:45:09  <amstan_i> how do you even visualize that?
2011-01-18T09:45:10  <delt0r___> one type of unit limits the kind of games from chess down to checkers
2011-01-18T09:45:17  <delt0r___> and tic tac toe
2011-01-18T09:45:31  <delt0r___> Visualise it with a number
2011-01-18T09:45:38  <amstan_i> right now.. our visualizer... is one square per pixel
2011-01-18T09:45:46  <amstan_i> and it seems kinda neat like that
2011-01-18T09:45:46  <delt0r___> ??
2011-01-18T09:45:49  <antimatroid1> you don't need such large maps
2011-01-18T09:45:56  <amstan_i> ok, fine
2011-01-18T09:46:09  <amstan_i> numbers are boring though..
2011-01-18T09:46:17  <delt0r___> standart stratego is 10x10
2011-01-18T09:46:23  <antimatroid1> no, a lack of interesting strategy is boring
2011-01-18T09:46:32  <delt0r___> well its a response to the "too many kinds of units"
2011-01-18T09:46:34  <amstan_i> ok, show me a game example
2011-01-18T09:46:47  <amstan_i> we made one for ants
2011-01-18T09:46:49  <delt0r___> because the unit interaction is very simple
2011-01-18T09:46:53  <antimatroid1> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_-dabt0ee8
2011-01-18T09:47:07  <delt0r___> you can also play online
2011-01-18T09:48:01  <antimatroid1> the intended version is all simultaneous yeah?
2011-01-18T09:48:26  <delt0r___> well you can all the largest number a "feild marshall"
2011-01-18T09:48:28  <amstan_i> yeah
2011-01-18T09:48:45  <delt0r___> or a "black dragon"
2011-01-18T09:48:53  <amstan_i> but i don't see how you can make such a game if it's pretty much turn based
2011-01-18T09:48:57  <delt0r___> but then there are "too many unit types"
2011-01-18T09:49:14  <amstan_i> look at planet wars... there are turns, but they're pretty fluid
2011-01-18T09:49:29  <delt0r___> jmcarthur worked out the simulationus turns variant
2011-01-18T09:50:01  <delt0r___> seriosly... unit types don't lead to complexity... its rules that do
2011-01-18T09:50:18  <amstan_i> unit types are rules
2011-01-18T09:50:39  <delt0r___> not if the rules for all unit "types" are the same
2011-01-18T09:50:39  <antimatroid1> that stratego video actually looks kind of boring to watch
2011-01-18T09:50:48  <amstan_i> antimatroid1: +1
2011-01-18T09:51:16  <delt0r___> and ants? or Go? or chess?
2011-01-18T09:51:18  <amstan_i> delt0r___: what's the point of having unit types if they're all the same
2011-01-18T09:51:19  <delt0r___> or tron?
2011-01-18T09:51:33  <amstan_i> go and chess are killed
2011-01-18T09:51:43  <Frontier> So only the spy can capture the marshal, and only the minor can defuse the bomb, and the bomb and flag cannot move. That's all, right? Everything else is rank vs rank.
2011-01-18T09:52:01  <delt0r___> amstan_i: FFS --if you want to take is seriously read the rules... otherwise don't... and don't claim its someone else that doesn't want to play
2011-01-18T09:52:11  <delt0r___> thats fine
2011-01-18T09:52:20  <delt0r___> you don't have to wnat to play it
2011-01-18T09:52:27  <delt0r___> or have it for the next round
2011-01-18T09:52:44  <amstan_i> delt0r___: i'm just saying.. jeff didn't like it when he looked at it
2011-01-18T09:52:49  <amstan_i> don't kill the messenger
2011-01-18T09:53:03  <delt0r___> did he look at it as close as you have?
2011-01-18T09:53:09  <amstan_i> i'm still rather unconvinced, i don't hate it, but i would like to see something more exciting
2011-01-18T09:53:19  <delt0r___> well sugest away
2011-01-18T09:53:23  <delt0r___> suggest
2011-01-18T09:53:23  <amstan_i> we moved from idea to idea yesterday
2011-01-18T09:53:31  <amstan_i> considered like 5 games
2011-01-18T09:53:38  <delt0r___> here in IRC?
2011-01-18T09:53:40  <amstan_i> besides the ones already suggested
2011-01-18T09:53:43  <amstan_i> no.. IRL
2011-01-18T09:53:56  <delt0r___> hard to read those logs
2011-01-18T09:54:06  <amstan_i> he's working on a sim for hot vs cold now
2011-01-18T09:54:12  <delt0r___> ??
2011-01-18T09:54:13  <amstan_i> we'll see how that works
2011-01-18T09:54:14  <antimatroid1> what is that?
2011-01-18T09:54:27  <amstan_i> so.. each player has 1 agent on a grid
2011-01-18T09:54:29  <Frontier> isn't it stratego in the end ? ^^
2011-01-18T09:54:35  <amstan_i> it emits either coldness or hotness
2011-01-18T09:54:47  <amstan_i> and every turn you can move, and every turn the hot and cold spreads
2011-01-18T09:54:55  <amstan_i> with some kind of conservation of energy blur
2011-01-18T09:55:22  <antimatroid1> that has a bit of promise, why only one agent per player?
2011-01-18T09:55:22  <amstan_i> imagine the visualizer for that
2011-01-18T09:55:33  <amstan_i> antimatroid1: why do you need more?
2011-01-18T09:55:41  <antimatroid1> harder
2011-01-18T09:56:03  <antimatroid1> too easy to do a basic tree with 1 agent imo
2011-01-18T09:56:32  <delt0r___> amstan_i: tbh is sounds boring... not everyone finds physics really fun to watch
2011-01-18T09:56:40  <Frontier> not on a 1024x1024 grid
2011-01-18T09:57:15  <delt0r___> also i think you could come up with optimal strategies for that too
2011-01-18T09:57:30  <antimatroid1> i'd prefer an interesting and complicated game on smaller maps
2011-01-18T09:57:31  <delt0r___> diffusion process is well understood
2011-01-18T09:57:35  <antimatroid1> rather than a basic game on a huge map
2011-01-18T09:58:23  <antimatroid1> i also agree with delt0r in that something with private information would be cool
2011-01-18T09:58:38  <amstan_i> private info?
2011-01-18T09:58:42  <Frontier> Well, in my opinion that isn't more interesting to watch than a match of Stratego. The military ranks could be replaced with something the kids love today... vampires and werewolves anyone?
2011-01-18T09:58:46  <antimatroid1> information you know that they don't
2011-01-18T09:59:06  <amstan_i> Frontier: we're not kids though
2011-01-18T09:59:10  <antimatroid1> Frontier: vampires and warewolves? shoot me now :P
2011-01-18T09:59:21  <amstan_i> Frontier: and that ^^^ would be the reaction of many
2011-01-18T09:59:22  <Frontier> lol, what were the other ideas amstan?
2011-01-18T09:59:24  <antimatroid1> amstan_i: don't tell me what i'm not :P
2011-01-18T09:59:26  <amstan_i> Frontier: you forgot bella
2011-01-18T09:59:37  <delt0r___> Frontier: I was going to use dragons
2011-01-18T09:59:43  <amstan_i> dragons++
2011-01-18T09:59:49  <antimatroid1> you can't go wrong with unicorns
2011-01-18T09:59:50  <delt0r___> or zombies... but zombies was more of a joke
2011-01-18T10:00:26  <delt0r___> and you defent the fluffy pink unicorn
2011-01-18T10:00:45  <antimatroid1> unicorns aren't pink or fluffy
2011-01-18T10:00:50  <antimatroid1> what universe are you living in?
2011-01-18T10:00:54  <delt0r___> its so fluffy i think i;m gunna die, flufy
2011-01-18T10:00:57  <Frontier> Unicorns heh? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5im0Ssyyus
2011-01-18T10:01:13  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: ones with *real* unicorns
2011-01-18T10:02:19  <antimatroid1> what about that turn based / continous 2d fighter plane game?
2011-01-18T10:02:19  <delt0r___> amstan_i: what are the chances of a RTS type game passing the "too many types of things" test?
2011-01-18T10:02:32  <delt0r___> antimatroid1: my rts is bascially that
2011-01-18T10:02:39  <delt0r___> if you only have fighers
2011-01-18T10:02:40  <antimatroid1> let's do that
2011-01-18T10:02:42  <delt0r___> fighters
2011-01-18T10:03:08  <antimatroid1> people can Euler up (got that yesterday) and learn a tiny bit of maths
2011-01-18T10:03:12  <antimatroid1> it wont hurt them
2011-01-18T10:03:23  <delt0r___> well you don't really need to
2011-01-18T10:03:26  <antimatroid1> sounds like oil her up though
2011-01-18T10:03:55  <delt0r___> you can get away with pretty crude estimates for things and can leave the physics out
2011-01-18T10:04:11  <antimatroid1> yeah, but if you want a good bot surely you want to do some maths?
2011-01-18T10:04:25  <delt0r___> may bee
2011-01-18T10:04:43  <delt0r___> if i knew what would work... i wouldn't suggest it
2011-01-18T10:04:48  <antimatroid1> anyway, i'm going to bed
2011-01-18T10:04:49  <antimatroid1> it's 2am
2011-01-18T10:06:46  <delt0r___> amstan_i: what other types of games did you discuss?
2011-01-18T10:07:59  <amstan_i> delt0r___: a kind of dots and boxes
2011-01-18T10:08:06  <amstan_i> delt0r___: some stuff with mazes, that would be cool
2011-01-18T10:08:46  <delt0r___> mmm

2011-01-18T11:25:19  <jmcarthur> i don't understand this notion of rules that seems so complicated...
2011-01-18T11:25:36  <jmcarthur> rules are things like "you can't move flags or bombs" or "you can only move a unit one square at a time"
2011-01-18T11:26:05  <jmcarthur> *rules that can make things more complicated
2011-01-18T11:26:19  <jmcarthur> things like "A beats B and B beats C" are not rules that make things more complicated

2011-01-18T11:38:11  <jmcarthur> certainly not for starting out, at least. of course it complicates your strategies, but that's the point
2011-01-18T11:45:32  <jmcarthur> dude, planet wars should have looked like this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1ZpkFJ1GB4
2011-01-18T11:55:14  <delt0r___> jmcarthur: sorry not really following you
2011-01-18T11:56:48  <delt0r___> stratego is a game i played when i was about 6... there is no way its that complicated
2011-01-18T11:58:43  <amstan_i> jmcarthur: yes pls, lol
2011-01-18T11:58:47  <amstan_i> let's do aurora
2011-01-18T12:00:39  <delt0r___> jmcarthur: when i talk about rules being complicated i think of rules that need to take care of lots of edge cases... for example in some of the ant games.
2011-01-18T12:01:29  <delt0r___> while i consider both chess and stratego to have simple rules... so does go for that matter
2011-01-18T12:02:12  <delt0r___> they are "complicated" games --i would say stratego has simpler rules than chess.. just because it took me  while to understand knights
2011-01-18T12:03:09  <delt0r___> But some dude thats hot/cold ---mmm. Sounds more like a tron obsession.
2011-01-18T12:04:13  *** dr`tmp <dr`tmp!~weechat@ble59-7-88-161-172-151.fbx.proxad.net> has quit IRC (Quit: WeeChat 0.2.6)
2011-01-18T12:05:43  <jmcarthur> delt0r___: i was agreeing with you that the various unit types don't complicate things unnecessarily
2011-01-18T12:05:52  <delt0r___> right
2011-01-18T12:06:23  <jmcarthur> delt0r___: and stratego's "move units one square at a time" rule is *far* simpler than chess's "each unit moves differently" rules
2011-01-18T12:06:34  <delt0r___> well in stratego in particular the idea that there's lots of unit types is a bit miss leading.
2011-01-18T12:06:58  <jmcarthur> there are only two kinds of movement in the variant i have in mind, three in the real version
2011-01-18T12:07:04  <delt0r___> jmcarthur: agree -chess has more complex rules...
2011-01-18T12:07:07  <jmcarthur> move one square at a time, don't move at all
2011-01-18T12:07:15  <jmcarthur> and in the real version scouts can move more than one
2011-01-18T12:07:25  <delt0r___> and no diagonal movment
2011-01-18T12:08:06  <jmcarthur> right
2011-01-18T12:08:32  <jmcarthur> and really these are so simple that they are more like mechanics than rules
2011-01-18T12:08:35  <delt0r___> thou in this version souuts are kinda useless. I did like begin able to use a scout ... to well scout
2011-01-18T12:08:57  <jmcarthur> gotta eat. be back in a few
2011-01-18T12:09:10  <delt0r___> well if a bunch of 6 year olds could play stratego --i say its simple enough
2011-01-18T12:25:25  <Frontier> Here I found a shareware version where the scout can attack on it's move: http://www.windowsgames.co.uk/thegeneral.html
2011-01-18T12:30:03  <delt0r___> all modern version use this rule
2011-01-18T12:31:43  <jmcarthur> delt0r___: i think amstan_i and i are talking about how simple it would be to implement, not how simple it is for humans to understand. in either case, i disagree with amstan_i about how complicated stratego is
2011-01-18T12:32:13  <delt0r___> he hasn't even looked up the rules
2011-01-18T12:32:20  <jmcarthur> :(
2011-01-18T12:32:42  <jmcarthur> amstan_i: you should look up the rules. they are very simple
2011-01-18T12:35:04  <Frontier> Yeah at first I was overwhelmed with all the military ranks, but in the end units '1' to '7' are all equal! Only '8', '9' and the Spy are special.
2011-01-18T12:35:52  <Frontier> 8 can defeat bombs, 9 can walk any number of squares in one direction and the spy can kill '1'.
2011-01-18T12:36:59  <Frontier> oh yes, bombs are special too of course, they cannot move and kill anything but '8'.
2011-01-18T12:38:03  <jmcarthur> in my code i actually define them in this order:  Bomb, Marshal, General, Colonel, ..., Miner, Scout, Spy, Flag. that allows me to only have to say explicitly that miners beat bombs and spies beat marshals, then all the others fall out from their ranks naturally
2011-01-18T12:38:20  <jmcarthur> and for movement i only treat bombs and flags as special, of course
2011-01-18T12:38:47  <Frontier> and the scout maybe. you are right, ordered like this it is even simpler
2011-01-18T12:39:07  <jmcarthur> so my fighting code only cares about three cases
2011-01-18T12:39:22  <jmcarthur> miner vs. bomb, spy vs. marshal, and anything vs. anything

2011-01-18T14:35:48  <jmcarthur> i think it could be
2011-01-18T14:35:58  <jmcarthur> depends on what you call "decent" i guess
2011-01-18T14:48:01  <delt0r___> well there is always "random"
2011-01-18T14:48:05  <delt0r___> and "rage"
2011-01-18T14:48:22  <delt0r___> rage just attacks with everything it can
2011-01-18T14:48:44  <delt0r___> smart rage could at least use miners on mines once discovered
2011-01-18T15:03:33  <jmcarthur> rage could track units and simply attack those units as aggressively as possible and only with units that can beat them
2011-01-18T15:03:47  <jmcarthur> and for units that are unknown just attack with whatever
2011-01-18T15:04:03  <jmcarthur> it's more complex than rage in the past, i agree
2011-01-18T15:04:59  <jmcarthur> could ignore things like path finding though, for simplicity. if an effective unit can't magically find its way to a weak opponent unit, just allow it to get hung up
2011-01-18T15:05:38  <jmcarthur> i think it would still be formidible enough to be a strong bot for testing against, initially

2011-01-18T18:53:16  <McLeopold> paging jmcarthur or delt0r_...
2011-01-18T18:53:22  <jmcarthur> pong
2011-01-18T18:53:34  <McLeopold> so, about RTStratego...
2011-01-18T18:53:50  <jmcarthur> i'm guessing you're going to ask about its determinism
2011-01-18T18:54:06  <McLeopold> why did delt0r_ say that the spy and marshall will kill each other?
2011-01-18T18:54:18  <jmcarthur> ah
2011-01-18T18:54:18  <McLeopold> and I do get the idea of only legal moves
2011-01-18T18:54:35  <McLeopold> that makes my forum question mute, which is a good decision for the game
2011-01-18T18:54:56  <jmcarthur> in normal stratego, the spy only kills the marshal if it attacks the marshal, but the marshal beats the spy if the marshal is the attacker
2011-01-18T18:55:04  <McLeopold> oh
2011-01-18T18:55:08  <jmcarthur> and delt0r_ wants it to be as close to the board game as possible
2011-01-18T18:55:12  <jmcarthur> i kind of disagree though
2011-01-18T18:55:23  <jmcarthur> i'd rather it just be consistent, and it makes sense for the spy to always beat the marshal
2011-01-18T18:55:44  <McLeopold> yes, that makes more sense to me
2011-01-18T18:55:59  <jmcarthur> but yeah, that's the reasoning behind it
2011-01-18T18:56:40  <McLeopold> what about scouts and a single square per turn. do units move different distances?
2011-01-18T18:56:50  <jmcarthur> i'd rather scouts only move one square per turn
2011-01-18T18:57:01  <jmcarthur> i still think they'd be useful
2011-01-18T18:57:09  <jmcarthur> delt0r_ disagrees with me on that too, i think
2011-01-18T18:57:14  <McLeopold> in the real game to they move more?
2011-01-18T18:57:27  <jmcarthur> in the real game they can move as far as you want in any one direction
2011-01-18T18:57:38  <jmcarthur> of course, taking advantage of that gives them away
2011-01-18T18:57:50  <jmcarthur> but that's just a tradeoff
2011-01-18T18:58:08  <Zannick> yeah, but you'd do that when you attack with them
2011-01-18T18:58:09  <McLeopold> do you reveal a unit of you lose to them?
2011-01-18T18:58:20  <jmcarthur> in the official rules, yes
2011-01-18T18:58:38  <McLeopold> I'm more familiar with Field Tactics which is Nintendo's knock off version.
2011-01-18T18:58:44  <jmcarthur> Zannick: no, the board game only allows you to move or attack, not both. even with scouts
2011-01-18T18:58:54  <Zannick> unless you have a third party judging, you have to
2011-01-18T18:59:03  <Zannick> jmcarthur: wait, really? then i always played it wrong
2011-01-18T18:59:04  <jmcarthur> oh i misread
2011-01-18T18:59:09  <Zannick> i conflated moving with attacking
2011-01-18T18:59:13  <jmcarthur> oh, but you still had the misconception i thought you had ;)
2011-01-18T18:59:16  <jmcarthur> okay well...
2011-01-18T18:59:22  <jmcarthur> when you attack, if you win you move
2011-01-18T18:59:32  <Zannick> wherein you had to move onto an enemy square to attack
2011-01-18T18:59:36  <jmcarthur> but when you move a scout more than one space or whatever, you can't attack at the same time
2011-01-18T18:59:43  *** mceier <mceier!~mceier@89-77-208-118.dynamic.chello.pl> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
2011-01-18T18:59:44  <jmcarthur> right
2011-01-18T18:59:58  <jmcarthur> but attacks and moves are technically distinct
2011-01-18T19:00:01  <Zannick> oh, then i guess that's just a special case for the scout
2011-01-18T19:00:09  <jmcarthur> the move for the attack is just a sideeffect of winning the attack
2011-01-18T19:00:23  <Zannick> i like my version better; it's simpler :P
2011-01-18T19:00:33  <McLeopold> unless the opponent moves to the same square
2011-01-18T19:00:38  <jmcarthur> i think the normal rules are just as simple. you just have a different intuition about it
2011-01-18T19:00:42  <Zannick> for the board game, i mean
2011-01-18T19:00:43  <sigh> seems like everyone has their own version, which they like
2011-01-18T19:00:47  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: in the real version it's not simultaneous play
2011-01-18T19:00:55  <McLeopold> yeah, i did get that :)
2011-01-18T19:01:25  <McLeopold> are all units a different strength?
2011-01-18T19:01:29  <jmcarthur> Zannick: the official rules are: you can either move or attack. you can only attack adjacent units. if you win an attack, you take the losing unit's place
2011-01-18T19:01:39  <Zannick> there's no third case for attacking; your piece wins, or dies
2011-01-18T19:01:43  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: there are classes of units
2011-01-18T19:02:04  <jmcarthur> well, both can die
2011-01-18T19:02:08  <jmcarthur> if they are the same rank
2011-01-18T19:02:19  <jmcarthur> but one must die
2011-01-18T19:02:23  <Zannick> yes, but only two outcomes for your piece
2011-01-18T19:02:26  <jmcarthur> yes
2011-01-18T19:02:29  <Zannick> it either takes the square or is gone
2011-01-18T19:02:37  <jmcarthur> i can see it framed your way
2011-01-18T19:02:45  <jmcarthur> i'm just saying it's pretty easy to phrase this way, too
2011-01-18T19:02:54  <jmcarthur> certainly not any more complicated
2011-01-18T19:02:54  <Zannick> maybe we just played that way as a convention
2011-01-18T19:02:59  <Zannick> i haven't played in a long time
2011-01-18T19:03:14  <jmcarthur> i played a few games against my wife after i decided to propose it here
2011-01-18T19:03:22  <jmcarthur> so it's pretty fresh on my mind
2011-01-18T19:04:08  <McLeopold> add some unit spawns and it's antwars...
2011-01-18T19:04:15  <jmcarthur> it's not a special case for the scout when it's framed the way i said it
2011-01-18T19:04:35  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ants don't have ranks, stratego doesn't have food, ants don't have bombs or flags
2011-01-18T19:04:48  <jmcarthur> and you can't spawn units in stratego
2011-01-18T19:04:50  <jmcarthur> as you said
2011-01-18T19:05:02  <jmcarthur> and ants doesn't have hidden state
2011-01-18T19:05:10  <jmcarthur> except maybe fog of war
2011-01-18T19:05:12  <McLeopold> I'm just thinking how the visualizer would look similar in the middle game.
2011-01-18T19:05:35  <jmcarthur> if the visualizer can hide units as though from a particular bot's point of view, it would look very different
2011-01-18T19:06:03  <jmcarthur> whereas with ants, all units are effectively the same
2011-01-18T19:06:11  <McLeopold> I would say ignore the scout movement, then you don't have to do a special check for illegal scout movements over enemy pieces.
2011-01-18T19:06:13  <jmcarthur> one variant of ants had hp i guess
2011-01-18T19:06:16  <jmcarthur> right
2011-01-18T19:06:27  <McLeopold> But I'm only thinking of newbie programmers.
2011-01-18T19:07:07  <jmcarthur> scouts don't move special, spies always beat marshals, you can move as many units on one turn as you want. i think that's all the differences i can think of compared to the board game
2011-01-18T19:07:26  <McLeopold> unless it's on an 8x8 board, then we can use magic bitboards for rook movements.
2011-01-18T19:07:28  <Zannick> the visualizer should have the capability to "view as player x"
2011-01-18T19:07:36  <Zannick> for any game with hidden information
2011-01-18T19:07:38  <jmcarthur> agreed
2011-01-18T19:07:55  <jmcarthur> and maybe also persistently show units that have already been revealed
2011-01-18T19:07:57  <McLeopold> could this be multi-player?
2011-01-18T19:07:59  <jmcarthur> since the bot would do that anyway
2011-01-18T19:08:04  <McLeopold> and still be a good game?
2011-01-18T19:08:10  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: combat resolution would get harder
2011-01-18T19:08:15  <McLeopold> oh, yes
2011-01-18T19:08:25  <jmcarthur> arbitrary, even
2011-01-18T19:08:35  <McLeopold> with the spy beats marshall, yea
2011-01-18T19:08:43  <McLeopold> everyone loses?
2011-01-18T19:08:47  * jmcarthur shrugs
2011-01-18T19:08:54  <jmcarthur> RPS scenarios suck for >2 players
2011-01-18T19:09:02  <Zannick> spy, marshal, x => everyone dies
2011-01-18T19:09:08  <Zannick> otherwise there isn't a circular loop
2011-01-18T19:09:28  <jmcarthur> bomb, miner, marshal?
2011-01-18T19:10:12  <jmcarthur> well... bomb, miner, anything but scout
2011-01-18T19:10:28  <Zannick> everyone dies
2011-01-18T19:10:36  <McLeopold> depends on if the other beats the miner
2011-01-18T19:10:47  <Zannick> and if it's bomb, bomb, miner, marshal, the game is over and no one wins
2011-01-18T19:10:52  <McLeopold> if it is circular, everyone loses, else the top stays
2011-01-18T19:10:54  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: scouts and spies lose to miners
2011-01-18T19:11:04  <jmcarthur> **bomb, miner, anything but scout or spy
2011-01-18T19:11:30  <Zannick> spy takes out only the marshal?
2011-01-18T19:11:33  <jmcarthur> what about four players? the presence of a cyclic resolution means all four die?
2011-01-18T19:11:37  <jmcarthur> Zannick: right
2011-01-18T19:11:51  <jmcarthur> even if one of the units could be outside of the circle?
2011-01-18T19:11:52  <Zannick> i seem to have thought spy wins when it attacks
2011-01-18T19:12:05  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: if any other unit can beat your unit, it is removed, otherwise it stays
2011-01-18T19:12:10  <jmcarthur> Zannick: that's right, but it would be simpler if it always wins against marshal for our purposes
2011-01-18T19:12:20  <jmcarthur> McLeopold: ah, so planet wars style
2011-01-18T19:12:28  <jmcarthur> ish
2011-01-18T19:12:38  <Zannick> jmcarthur: the circle, however, is always maximal, so the piece must be somewhere inside it
2011-01-18T19:12:46  <Zannick> with spy, marshal for sure
2011-01-18T19:12:47  <jmcarthur> yeah, you're right
2011-01-18T19:12:56  <jmcarthur> well, no
2011-01-18T19:13:00  <Zannick> with miner, bomb, no
2011-01-18T19:13:02  *** Migi32 <Migi32!~migi@178-118-148-74.access.telenet.be> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2011-01-18T19:13:02  <jmcarthur> bomb can be outside of it
2011-01-18T19:13:03  <jmcarthur> yeah
2011-01-18T19:13:12  <jmcarthur> bomb, marshal, spy, scout
2011-01-18T19:13:31  <Zannick> but then the only way to be outside the circle is to be worse than the miner
2011-01-18T19:13:34  <Zannick> oh
2011-01-18T19:13:37  <jmcarthur> bomb wins
2011-01-18T19:13:45  <Zannick> i keep thinking only of "everyone tries to move into an empty square"
2011-01-18T19:14:02  <jmcarthur> in a 4 player game there could be up to five units on a square
2011-01-18T19:14:05  <Zannick> yeah, bomb wins
2011-01-18T19:14:16  <jmcarthur> err
2011-01-18T19:14:17  <jmcarthur> four
2011-01-18T19:14:19  <McLeopold> jmcarthur: that would violate your "legal moves"
2011-01-18T19:14:21  <McLeopold> y
2011-01-18T19:15:11  <jmcarthur> >2 players also raises questions about revealing units
2011-01-18T19:15:22  <jmcarthur> do units only get revealed to the combatants?
2011-01-18T19:15:28  <McLeopold> hmm...
2011-01-18T19:16:16  <McLeopold> I'd say yes
2011-01-18T19:16:44  <jmcarthur> i think so too
2011-01-18T19:17:10  <jmcarthur> okay, so this seems to generalize to >2 players fairly decently... i'm not sure if that means we *should* do that though
2011-01-18T19:17:48  <McLeopold> because someone would have to implement TrueSkill and defend it against Accoun?
2011-01-18T19:18:01  <jmcarthur> ha
2011-01-18T19:18:23  <jmcarthur> and also because Trueskill isn't even completely fair in >2 player games, iirc
2011-01-18T19:18:44  <jmcarthur> you have to assign a complete ordering of the players, not just a partial ordering
2011-01-18T19:18:56  <jmcarthur> so even if a couple of them technically tie, you have to pick a winner and loser out of them
2011-01-18T19:19:06  <jmcarthur> i could be wrong about that
2011-01-18T19:19:13  <McLeopold> I'm thinking you are wrong...
2011-01-18T19:19:22  <jmcarthur> i might be
2011-01-18T19:19:28  <jmcarthur> oh i'm thinking team games can be unfair
2011-01-18T19:19:34  <jmcarthur> i think FFA games are okay
2011-01-18T19:20:54  <jmcarthur> supposedly a nice thing about FFA games with Trueskill is that they converge onto accurate scores *very* quickly
2011-01-18T19:21:03  <McLeopold> yeah, the calculator let's you set 2 ranks in a 3 player game
2011-01-18T19:26:40  <McLeopold> looks like there is a yearly computer stratego contest
2011-01-18T19:29:50  <McLeopold> They have some anti-chase rules and some other no repeating rules.
2011-01-18T19:30:21  <McLeopold> I wonder if that still applies to real-time stratego?
2011-01-18T19:43:27  <antimatroid1> is the plan to have different maps with obstacles?
2011-01-18T19:43:29  <antimatroid1> i like varying maps
2011-01-18T19:43:41  <antimatroid1> it's less repetitive
2011-01-18T19:44:11  <rebelxt> yo guys, is there an ETA for the next contest?
2011-01-18T19:44:29  <antimatroid1> rebelxt: some time in february i think they want one up
2011-01-18T19:44:41  <rebelxt> antimatroid1: sounds good. thanks
2011-01-18T19:45:04  <antimatroid1> there's no agreement on game to use though
2011-01-18T19:45:16  <antimatroid1> or specifics of any possible game
2011-01-18T19:45:33  <rebelxt> yeah - i've just started catching up on forum posts with game ideas
2011-01-18T19:47:32  <antimatroid1> i still think my ants game would make for a decent ai game, i'm not as interested in stratego as i was a day ago
2011-01-18T19:47:44  <antimatroid1> but the current ants game i don't really like at all
2011-01-18T19:48:01  <rebelxt> hopefully contest at work is over by that time, since this work contest has a good prize...
2011-01-18T19:48:14  <antimatroid1> amstan_i: my more complicated ants game would work as 4 player too
2011-01-18T19:48:18  <rebelxt> was ants game simplified? original proposal was too complex imho
2011-01-18T19:48:32  <antimatroid1> how can it be too complex?
2011-01-18T19:49:10  <antimatroid1> it wasn't even very complex, but mine was all in a single process, and the objective was to try and invade their home/spawn square with one of your ants, but you could also harvest grains to take back to base (generating more ants) and fight an ant in an adjacent square
2011-01-18T19:49:41  <amstan_i> rebelxt: see simpleants branch
2011-01-18T19:49:41  <amstan_i> @repo
2011-01-18T19:49:42  <contestbot> amstan_i: repo = https://github.com/amstan/aichallenge/
2011-01-18T19:50:21  <rebelxt> well, i'm still reading the thread.. just initial reaction. let me finish before i speak again ;-)
2011-01-18T19:50:58  <rebelxt> amstan_i: move to github = awesome
2011-01-18T19:51:27  <amstan_i> rebelxt: i can give you commit technologies if you want
2011-01-18T19:52:49  <rebelxt> sure, apinkin on github
2011-01-18T19:54:19  <amstan_i> done
2011-01-18T19:57:17  <rebelxt> cool, trying simpleants
2011-01-18T19:58:39  <antimatroid1> i don't think the strategies used for that would vary much
2011-01-18T20:01:01  <antimatroid1> there's basically two things, maximise the squares you can reach first and be the first to new resources

2011-01-18T20:10:36  <rebelxt> good memories
2011-01-18T20:13:22  <dmj111> about the inbalance in trueskill:  i *think* the issue is that the algorithm stops before convergence, so two players in a tie get slightly different updates. (only in a > 2 player game)
2011-01-18T20:13:22  <dmj111> a way around that is to order the ties by rating... lower rated player goes first in the order.  that may make up for the inbalance, and keep it from reinforcing itself.
2011-01-18T20:13:54  <dmj111> it may be less complicated than that, but I am giving the algorithm the benefit of my doubt.

2011-01-18T20:23:18  <antimatroid1> what about a game like ants, but iteration was based on conways game of life rules
2011-01-18T20:23:27  <antimatroid1> so you could move before the next iteration, and it was more than one player
2011-01-18T20:24:06  <antimatroid1> people could make glider guns etc. to shoot stuff off at the enemy
2011-01-18T20:24:13  <antimatroid1> going and wrecking their guns etc.
2011-01-18T20:26:14  <Zannick> we would need color rules...
2011-01-18T20:26:15  <rebelxt> heh never thought of this
2011-01-18T20:26:30  <antimatroid1> yeah, i'm pondering atm
2011-01-18T20:26:31  <Zannick> hm.
2011-01-18T20:26:41  <Zannick> well, not really, i guess
2011-01-18T20:26:44  <antimatroid1> you could require the squares adjacent to be of one colour to count, but then you have collisions?
2011-01-18T20:26:48  <Zannick> the birth rule is 3 neighbors.
2011-01-18T20:27:07  <Zannick> if 2+ of them are one color, the new square is that color
2011-01-18T20:27:10  <antimatroid1> it counts diagonal though yeah?
2011-01-18T20:27:30  <Zannick> that doesn't matter, it's exactly 3 neighbors in order to create a square
2011-01-18T20:27:36  <Zannick> but yes
2011-01-18T20:27:48  <antimatroid1> what if both players have 3 adjacent coloured squares?
2011-01-18T20:27:55  <Zannick> exactly 3 means there won't be a tie
2011-01-18T20:28:03  <antimatroid1> oh, i see what you mean
2011-01-18T20:28:13  <Zannick> the players don't occupy the board
2011-01-18T20:28:15  <antimatroid1> okay, i'm going to play around with this for a bit, that would be fun
2011-01-18T20:28:22  <Zannick> cool
2011-01-18T20:29:37  <antimatroid1> how would maps start? randomly made symmetric grids? then players can move each turn before iterating to the next state?
2011-01-18T20:29:55  <antimatroid1> so you actually have to form glider guns etc. rather than just placing them at the start
2011-01-18T20:30:45  <Zannick> random symmetric grids, give the player a handful of colored squares to place and a region to place them
2011-01-18T20:30:59  <Zannick> perhaps?
2011-01-18T20:31:27  <antimatroid1> yeah okay, so 2n x 2n grid with randomly placed "walls", then players get to place their x starting squares anywhere on their half?
2011-01-18T20:32:18  <Zannick> walls? i was just thinking neutral squares
2011-01-18T20:32:44  <antimatroid1> so just a blank starting grid? or randomly place some colours already? and if the later should they both start anywhere on the grid, or their half?
2011-01-18T20:33:05  <antimatroid1> i think larger grids would be good for this
2011-01-18T20:33:08  <Zannick> and either in their half, or in their third
2011-01-18T20:33:15  <Zannick> in their third would be decent, i think
2011-01-18T20:33:26  <antimatroid1> 3 player?
2011-01-18T20:33:34  <antimatroid1> easier to do 4 on a square grid surely?
2011-01-18T20:33:49  <Zannick> no, divide the grid into three equal strips, leave the center one out
2011-01-18T20:33:54  <antimatroid1> ah yep
2011-01-18T20:33:56  <Zannick> player one on the left, player two on the right
2011-01-18T20:34:05  <Zannick> neutral black squares at random
2011-01-18T20:34:07  <antimatroid1> wrapped edged? (i want)
2011-01-18T20:34:16  <Zannick> player one is red, player two blue, or something
2011-01-18T20:34:25  <antimatroid1> how does one claim a neutral square?
2011-01-18T20:34:43  <Zannick> antimatroid1: i have never seen the game of life on a torus, now i'm curious
2011-01-18T20:34:44  <janzert> let the starting grid be completely blank, then you don't need to worry about starting map at all
2011-01-18T20:34:52  <Zannick> janzert: but then every game ends up the same
2011-01-18T20:35:05  <janzert> as long as the players play the same, yep
2011-01-18T20:35:11  <antimatroid1> Zannick: it's cool, and you don't have to worry about gliders going off to infinity, just coming through and tearing your shit up
2011-01-18T20:35:29  <Zannick> antimatroid1: you don't. you kill them, and use them to make more of yours
2011-01-18T20:35:39  <Zannick> janzert: assume that players will play optimally
2011-01-18T20:35:47  * janzert is really interested in a game that doesn't require map generation
2011-01-18T20:35:52  <Zannick> place optimally
2011-01-18T20:35:58  <antimatroid1> i prefer maps being different other than the players starting moves
2011-01-18T20:36:08  * antimatroid1 loves map generation :(
2011-01-18T20:36:08  <janzert> then the game is "solved" and wasn't deep enough
2011-01-18T20:36:16  <janzert> but I don't think that will be likely
2011-01-18T20:36:29  <Zannick> antimatroid1: oh, that would require segmenting the board further if we want to leave buffer space between the starting regions
2011-01-18T20:36:57  <antimatroid1> Zannick: hmmm yeah
2011-01-18T20:37:08  <Zannick> hm, i think the game of life would be interesting if the only moves were placing your initial pieces and letting it go
2011-01-18T20:37:24  <Zannick> hm
2011-01-18T20:37:44  <janzert> nah, being able to modify it throughout would be where it gets interesting
2011-01-18T20:37:44  <antimatroid1> possibly, but it's not really an on the go game then
2011-01-18T20:37:45  <Zannick> interesting, but pretty bad
2011-01-18T20:37:54  <antimatroid1> you can just hard code a strategy you decided on
2011-01-18T20:38:02  <Zannick> since then you win or lose on that
2011-01-18T20:38:36  <Zannick> so then the obvious question is how would we modify state during the game?
2011-01-18T20:39:07  <antimatroid1> simple, you can move from one square to an adjacent one
2011-01-18T20:39:11  <antimatroid1> for any of your coloured squares
2011-01-18T20:39:25  <antimatroid1> collisions get reverted as per what delt0r was doing for ants
2011-01-18T20:39:25  <janzert> how about by being able to place or erase n squares in your area each turn
2011-01-18T20:39:29  <Zannick> for each of them?
2011-01-18T20:39:37  <antimatroid1> i like janzerts idea better
2011-01-18T20:39:39  <Zannick> janzert: i was thinking that
2011-01-18T20:40:09  <Zannick> but with a reserve, so pick up a couple one turn, put them down the next
2011-01-18T20:40:18  <antimatroid1> say you want to turn one of their squares into yours, do you have to erase and place, or just 1 place?
2011-01-18T20:41:38  <janzert> I would say you can only place on blank (empty) squares
2011-01-18T20:42:00  <Zannick> you have to either add rules about turning their squares, or go with the base rules where you have to kill them and have more pieces next to blank squares being born
2011-01-18T20:42:23  <janzert> and yeah, it may be good to be able to build up a reserve so you can build bigger structures
2011-01-18T20:42:33  <antimatroid1> actually yeah, it's too easy if they can just kill you off as you come onto their space
2011-01-18T20:42:36  <janzert> maybe you just get n per turn and can either use 'em or bank them
2011-01-18T20:43:07  <Zannick> the game will explode if we just hand them n per turn in addition to the generation rules
2011-01-18T20:43:13  <antimatroid1> i think the easiest partition is to just split the grid again
2011-01-18T20:43:29  <janzert> I was thinking a very low n 5-10
2011-01-18T20:43:50  <Zannick> it has to be proportional to the size of the grid
2011-01-18T20:43:57  <Zannick> consider how many turns a game might take
2011-01-18T20:44:11  <Zannick> 100 turns => 500 free squares
2011-01-18T20:44:20  <antimatroid1> what about a larger number that can be placed first turn
2011-01-18T20:44:27  <antimatroid1> so you could set up a glider gun or whatever
2011-01-18T20:44:29  <Zannick> i'd go with let them generate their own reserve after the initial turn
2011-01-18T20:44:34  <antimatroid1> it would be very hard to form one during a game i think
2011-01-18T20:44:47  <antimatroid1> actually, with reserve you have to save up for it, nevermind
2011-01-18T20:44:48  <Zannick> it isn't necessarily the best strategy
2011-01-18T20:45:23  <Zannick> since your goal is to wipe out the other player, eg take over enough squares
2011-01-18T20:45:37  <antimatroid1> or have the most squares coloured after M turns
2011-01-18T20:45:56  <Zannick> that would be the secondary condition on ending early
2011-01-18T20:46:08  <Zannick> s/secondary/win/
2011-01-18T20:46:18  <janzert> for a decent size grid game length may be a problem, maybe the players only get a turn every x world updates
2011-01-18T20:46:19  <antimatroid1> yes, but you couldn't ignore that
2011-01-18T20:46:37  <Zannick> i really like this idea
2011-01-18T20:46:43  <Zannick> but i have to go
2011-01-18T20:46:49  <antimatroid1> i quite like it, the strategy space will be huge
2011-01-18T20:46:51  * Zannick ->
2011-01-18T20:47:19  <antimatroid1> i think there was an old dos game a bit like this
2011-01-18T20:47:26  <antimatroid1> around the time of pipes, ski guy thing etc,
2011-01-18T20:47:37  <janzert> the only downside may be that I'm not sure there are really straightforward simple strategies
2011-01-18T20:47:59  <antimatroid1> janzert: starter bot could just keep making gliders aimed at the enemy?
2011-01-18T20:48:19  <janzert> and a glider gun isn't the most intuitive thing to look at
2011-01-18T20:48:28  <antimatroid1> no, just the glider
2011-01-18T20:48:30  <janzert> but I think it would be fun
2011-01-18T20:48:36  <antimatroid1> it requires 5 placements
2011-01-18T20:48:44  <janzert> yeah
2011-01-18T20:48:46  <antimatroid1> just keep placing one of those every turn
2011-01-18T20:54:24  <antimatroid1> you would also need to write a strategy for last turn
2011-01-18T20:54:33  <antimatroid1> whereby you are trying to maximise the number of squares after the final iteration
2011-01-18T20:55:02  <antimatroid1> might even be easily solvable, but something fun for people to play around with
2011-01-18T20:55:23  <antimatroid1> amstan_i: read above, there's another game idea for you
2011-01-18T20:56:32  <janzert> since live itself is turing complete I don't think there will be any simple strategy to maximize the final count for anything other than a trivial number of steps
2011-01-18T20:56:43  <janzert> s/live/life
2011-01-18T20:57:06  <antimatroid1> i quite like this
2011-01-18T20:57:27  <antimatroid1> 3 player could be done fairly easily, minus the ranking
2011-01-18T20:58:33  <antimatroid1> actually, what about 2 player on a torus with the grid split in 4, each player gets diagonally adjacent sections
2011-01-18T20:58:45  <antimatroid1> so you are wrapped to them on the sides and top/bottom
2011-01-18T20:59:36  <janzert> I think I'd want neutral buffer space between players where no one can make changes
2011-01-18T21:00:17  <antimatroid1> then perhaps easiest to have something like m x 4n, player one gets the first 1/4, player two the third 1/4?
2011-01-18T21:01:13  <antimatroid1> i quite like the idea of having a map generator that already places a selected amount of squares for each player, then you have to try and build off of what you are given
2011-01-18T21:01:21  <janzert> that would work, no wrapping and 3rds or... lots of configurations would probably work fine
2011-01-18T21:01:21  <antimatroid1> plus i really like dynamic maps :P
2011-01-18T21:01:35  <antimatroid1> wrapping i would want
2011-01-18T21:02:21  <janzert> maps always add another dimension besides player skill to the outcome of a game though
2011-01-18T21:02:49  <janzert> I'm probably overly negative on them after the experience of the last contest though
2011-01-18T21:03:09  <antimatroid1> if a map generator is used, hopefully we will have a good one from the start this time
2011-01-18T21:03:28  <antimatroid1> i can bang them out pretty quickly now
2011-01-18T21:03:35  <antimatroid1> they aren't necessarily pretty, but they work

2011-01-18T21:10:53  <antimatroid1> more concisely: 2 player game of life on a discrete grid, where each player can place up to n + previously unused squares each turn in their region

2011-01-18T23:31:50  <Mathnerd314> seems rather biased...
2011-01-18T23:33:52  <Error323> lol
2011-01-18T23:35:07  <Mathnerd314> wait, did you write it?
2011-01-18T23:35:18  <Error323> yes
2011-01-18T23:35:57  <sigh> you seem a bit angry
2011-01-18T23:36:25  <Mathnerd314> hmm, I wonder which reddits would like it...
2011-01-18T23:36:48  <Error323> I am, well was
2011-01-18T23:36:54  <Error323> its now out of my system
2011-01-18T23:36:56  <Error323> :D
2011-01-18T23:38:03  <sigh> it's also more of a tirade against a few specific religions than religion in general
2011-01-18T23:38:29  <Error323> well
2011-01-18T23:38:36  <Error323> lets just say that this captures the majority
2011-01-18T23:40:22  <Mathnerd314> Error323: do you think /r/atheism would benefit?
2011-01-18T23:40:39  <Error323> Mathnerd314: maybe, let them decide?
2011-01-18T23:40:46  <Error323> feel free :P
2011-01-18T23:41:10  <sigh> christianity and islam together probably make up a majority but not by much
2011-01-18T23:41:34  <sigh> even then, the statements you make don't apply unilaterally to everyone in those two religions
2011-01-18T23:41:57  <Error323> ofc not
2011-01-18T23:42:25  <Mathnerd314> well, I have 1 karma... can I go down?
2011-01-18T23:42:52  <sigh> I don't think link karma can go negative
2011-01-18T23:45:57  <Mathnerd314> then I'm good.
2011-01-18T23:47:33  <Error323> So you think I crossed some line?
2011-01-18T23:48:14  <sigh> Error323: no really, I just don't think that your argument is very cogent
2011-01-18T23:48:18  <sigh> *not really
2011-01-18T23:48:51  <Error323> hmmm pitty
2011-01-18T23:51:35  <Error323> which arguments do you find cogen
2011-01-18T23:51:38  <Error323> cogent*
2011-01-18T23:51:46  <Error323> and which do you not
2011-01-18T23:51:49  <amstan> important is that we all feel supperior
2011-01-18T23:51:50  <amstan> lol
2011-01-18T23:52:17  <amstan> try to be nice toward people's beliefs though, it seems like we have a wide audience in here
2011-01-18T23:52:37  <Error323> I am

2011-01-18T23:53:37  <Mathnerd314> Error323: change the background?
2011-01-18T23:54:21  <Error323> Mathnerd314: done
2011-01-18T23:55:26  <sigh> Error323: mostly, you suppose a lot of things about what people believe and their motives
2011-01-18T23:55:45  <sigh> and also what I said before, it's mostly a tirade against specific religions
2011-01-18T23:56:00  <amstan> but yeah, it's a good blog post, too bad people that he's ranting about will ignore it
2011-01-18T23:56:09  <amstan> and people that agree with it don't have reasons to read it
2011-01-18T23:56:26  <Error323> well, got one reply :D
2011-01-18T23:56:30  <Error323> kxar zei

2011-01-18T23:57:05  <sigh> it's got a few replies :P
2011-01-18T23:58:15  <Error323> haha yay
2011-01-18T23:59:01  * Mathnerd314 waits for upvotes :-(
2011-01-18T23:59:13  <Error323> yeh
